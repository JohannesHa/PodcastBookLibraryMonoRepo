A Sure is changing the way investors manage private transactions. When we recently launched our own venture fund Positive Sum, I found out my biggest investor used the share to manage their investment with a share. Investors can eliminate nearly all the admin cost of private investment. On top of that, they handle all the back end legal taxes, accounting and compliance. When you outsource to assure you'll have more time to nurture your investor relationships and do more deals, all of it with a straightforward one time fee, learn more and try to share for yourself at a Sherko.

My guest today is Daniel Gross. Daniel is the founder of Pioneer, an extremely unique company which he describes as a fully remote startup generator that helps talented people around the world figure out if their idea has legs. You can learn more about it.
00:02:52
A Pioneer app, a wide ranging conversation, covers the art of asking great questions, the use of predictive modeling and psychometrics to identify talent, and why psychometrics are probably overrated and not that scientific. We then dive into exciting new frontiers for tech investing, ranging from three to satellites. I really enjoyed this conversation and hope you will too.
00:03:15
So, Daniel, I don't think I've ever started the podcast by asking about movies, but there's two that you and I were talking about earlier that I thought would be a fun place to start. Those two hour crank starring Jason Statham and Whiplash, which is one of my all time favorites. Why do you care about these two movies?
00:03:30
I love those two movies. I find them very useful as a screening tactic as well. Whiplash as to those maybe who haven't seen as a story of a musician, a drummer in particular, with the talented coach who gets pushed a little bit too much. And I very much love that story. I very much empathize with that. The story of kind of the insecure overachiever following almost too much in love with the vehicle of his performance. And you could cut it many ways, whether it's inspirational or cautionary tale.
00:03:54
But what I find interesting is there's a lot of questions you can't really ask people directly when you're talking to them in interviews or social settings or whatever. And and I find their opinion on movies to be something that lets you have that conversation in a fairly coded way. It's so interesting. I find it relaxes the conversation a little bit. Even as we're talking about movies now, it feels much less tense than a conversation about, I don't know, the top performing stocks or something.
00:04:19
So there's an element of play and novelty and kind of using it in the interview.
00:04:22
What do you think that tests in people? So the whiplash is a great litmus test and you could see how it would rub some people the exact wrong way and others, like you said, see themselves in it or something. What is that line that's being played with there?
00:04:37
The last question is actually one. I have used quite a bunch of interviews. I find it separates people, I think, who have a adversarial relationship with their work to maybe an inspirational relationship with their work. And I understand if you have an adversarial relationship in most jobs, actually, I think we're both extremely lucky to have our jobs be our passions. But I think a lot of people in Silicon Valley in particular over time developed very much give and take relationship with their work where they want to do the minimum amount possible such that they can return to life.
00:05:05
I think that's fine for many people. I tend to very much enjoy the presence and company of just a different style of person. One who very much views the work as a way to perform as something inspiring is something to do more of. And there's an element of whiplash, almost a worshiping of achievement in that sense. Now, like everything, there's probably a dose response curve, like a hormone for work, and anything can go too far. But I feel like it very quickly filters out someone who says you wouldn't want to take anything too seriously to someone who says, gosh, I hate to say it, but that was great.
00:05:34
I don't know what causes that split in people, but that's, of course, a very interesting thing. Assuming they are working at a job that's a creative pursuit, we can kind of construe two different styles of jobs, maybe jobs, where the delta between the median and the tail is maybe 10 or 20 percent. So like a cab driver, best taxi driver in New York City is going to be 15 percent better than the median. But in a creative pursuit or in investing or software engineering, the tail is literally 10 times John Carmack is ten times better an engineer than myself.
00:06:01
So in those situations, I think you really want to be looking out for people that are really interested in the job and you work as they something that they almost have to meter and goes out for themselves as opposed to something that they're careful not to do too much of, so to speak.
00:06:15
You've laid like an amazing transition to one of the topics that I want to cover at the end of your story, which is Pioneer, but it's a perfect excuse to talk about what you've learned from screening through talent. Be helpful for you to first set some context and describe what Pioneer is, what it does, and then then ask all sorts of questions about parsing through talented people.
00:06:35
Pioneer is a company that I run and it's kind of a cross between the two different careers that I've had over the course of my life. I've initially started a search engine that got acquired by Apple later on, became an investor in a bunch of different startups and worked at a startup investment firm and pioneers. And the combination of those two things is kind of part search engine, part venture investment firm. And what we're trying to do is we're trying to use the power of the Internet to find people around the world that are potentially interested in starting companies.
00:07:02
And we're almost trying to, through software, both qualify them and figure out if they're good or not, and also almost convinced them to start companies even create, so to speak, more founders. You know, the same way you see peloton creating more cyclists or Strava creating more runners. I've had the pleasure over the course of my career, both through Pioneer and through others, to invest in a bunch of different companies. I've had the chance to meet a bunch of different founders and over the course of my time, having maybe been one and I'm very interested in this topic, I think there's an interesting question for any asset allocator to what extent you believe, especially at the early stage, that you want to be looking for great markets or great founders.
00:07:34
And like everything, the truth is somewhere in between, we can accept maybe as an axiom that being able to screen people, either using software or using your own mind is an important thing, not just for investors, of course, but for anyone looking to hire or really do anything significant in life. I find the question of talent to actually be the most important question in the world, because it is at the end of the day required to do anything interesting as somebody that's done for amount of predictive modeling.
00:07:58
I know from experience that often the most important thing is defining the outcome very cleanly and very well before testing certain variables or features against that outcome. I'd love to hear how you define talent. If the idea is to search for talented people, how do you know that you've found one in. I'm sort of modeling exercise metrics for success is a fascinating problem because at the end of the day, you're planting seeds and it'll take a decade or so for it to grow into its tree.
00:08:24
And we have these moments at Pioneer where we're not quite sure, are we successful or not. Companies have the end of the day, a very short term feedback loop to chase, which is revenue, which obviously can be abused, but I actually think is a general, wonderful incentive structure for progress in society. For us, it's obviously less clear and there's kind of metrics we can look at to figure out if a person is good. One thing Pioneer looks at is the fraction of folks we fund to get funded by others, which is right now around twenty, twenty five percent or so.
00:08:49
And so follow on funding is something you can look at. But of course we work or the vision fund has taught us that that alone isn't good enough. One thing I'm always on the lookout for with people, are they moving quickly? Are they evolving quickly? In my view, at the end of the day, when you're betting on a founder, especially if the market's not super clear, what you're trying to do is you're trying to predict that a particular person will have as many shots on goal as possible because occasionally companies get formed and it's akin to someone to sticking a toothpick in the sand in Saudi Arabia and oil comes gushing out.
00:09:16
Product market fit on day three. Great done. But more often than not, there's a tale of endurance there. And what you want is the person who's going to plunge as many toothpicks into the ground as possible, who's going to take as many shots on goal as possible. And that's why I think derivative is pretty important, because it's one thing to have energy. If you're kind of searching for random space, you could actually spend a lot of time within your company before you get somewhere.
00:09:36
But if there's a little bit of intelligence there, the kind of reinforcement learning algorithm at the end of the day will end up making compounding better and better decisions. Investors often think about the magic of compounding and how hidden that is for most people. I think it's interesting to think of compounding not just in Kager, but kind of in a person. And that, to me, is one of the simplest things you can try to measure on kind of a short term to give you a sense of whether the person, company or project are kind of going somewhere long term.
00:10:02
One of the things you mentioned, the blending of search engine and investment fund, it's so interesting. One of the mental models here would be something like page rank and search, like Google's original competitive advantage, where they base the quality of a site on like, I guess how often it was referred to or linked to by other sites. Is there some equivalent in talent for page rank? Is that a useful analogy for thinking about sorting through people?
00:10:25
That takes us down to the very interesting world of psychometrics and all sorts of ways we can try to use to try to get a sense of whether a person is good or not. And this would be remarkably important if it was possible, because we would find a way to highlight people that have been overlooked by every other possible system. One thing I'm very tickled by is Pioneer as a business model is economically incentivized to find people that have been overlooked by anyone else.
00:10:48
That is to say, the terms that we offer folks once or just embrace them as great are not terms that a Stanford undergrad should take or accept. Sequoia will offer them better terms, but we're very much going after these underrated assets. And so if you could find a way to figure out if these folks are good or not in software, mostly software, that would be great. The part of the issue is, though, that any time you kind of quantify anything in the world, you are taking a high level dimensional space and you're reducing it to a lower level dimension and you're going to lose data.
00:11:15
Question is whether you're losse encoding technique is truly going to be three, where at the end of the day, you don't notice the difference or is it something more aggressive? Are you losing kind of too many pixels or too many bytes along the process in an attempt to reduce a person to a number? Have you lost or the magic? And so to date, Pioneer has taken the approach of almost like a how would you say like a self-driving car algorithm where we still use humans to kind of occasionally guide the system and reinforce the data set?
00:11:43
Nothing works better than really trying to evaluate the person based on the progress that they make. So when you do sign up, you get a score and that score is how good you and your project is that merged. So on the one hand, it's have a drink. On the other hand, it's a little bit half power score on a bike in the sense that you can actively work to drive that score better. And you can see the feedback result.
00:12:04
You're very eager to see that number go up. We go for a week now again, like any maximization function, people will maximize it, whether it's societally good or not. I've really view founders as excellent hierarchy, maximizers and terrible hierarchy selectors. So people don't really know what they're doing, but they just want to drive the score that they have week over week. And it's pretty much built like a video game in that sense, where the more progress you make on your project, the higher your score goes.
00:12:27
And like page rank, there's a whole composite function of what goes into that score. It could be things like growing your revenue. It could be things like what other peers who are in Pioneer think about the progress that you've made this particular week or a myriad of other tasks. And our goal, our goal is to really shove more and more into this infinite portrait of what progress and accompanying an individual look like such that at the end of the day, we're fully able to quantify it, to actually view the resolution that we're currently using to understand someone to be fairly low.
00:12:54
Maybe it's a sixteen bit bitmap and some point there's going to be a whole four K edition of Pioneer where there's thousands of different metrics you can pump into the system. Twitter followers that you have and I don't know, YouTube views on your video and revenue growth this particular month. Revenue growth benchmarked against other companies. Analysis of the way your company interacts over slack as much as we can get. To really not just quantify who's good and who's not, but also motivate people to get better.
00:13:19
I think if we're able to build a reliable metric for day to day progress, that will not only be a great service for creating more startups, but I think it will be a great thing for productivity. You don't prove what you don't measure. And I think part of the issue is, by the way, not just for Pioneer, but I think for anyone working on something early stage or an investor is it's not really clear at the end of the day what separates a good day from a bad day.
00:13:41
There's no score. And we know that in markets and industries where there is a score, people do improve and markets are efficient. So, for example, in sales, it's very clear what a good day is, is very clear what a bad day is. And people are motivated to improve and measure who's great, who's not. And if there's someone junior on the team is really good, the rewarded based on the merits of their work in sports, this is extremely clear as well.
00:13:59
Good day and a bad day. It's not really clear if you're an investor, what a good day or bad day is. It's not really clear if you're an early stage startup. What a good day or bad days. I mean, even for a software engineer, it's not really clear what a good day or bad days.
00:14:09
I'm curious to what degree. Still psychometrics. Maybe you can define what that term means. What are some examples of psychometrics, what things you found, maybe that matter or are at least interesting to you, having explored all those avenues?
00:14:24
Yeah, psychometrics is a very interesting topic. At a high level.
00:14:27
It is the attempt to use various mechanics, mostly self-assessment mechanisms, to get a sense of the individual and to be able to Buckett them into different categories. Again, I think could be very easily used for evil. But for the most part, I think stands to be a force for good because it allows you to screen people without necessarily being subjected to the person's gender, race, language restriction, whatever. Over the course of a couple of decades or centuries, a bunch of different psychometric techniques have been discussed.
00:14:53
Myers Briggs is a tremendously popular one that in my personal, very humble opinion is horribly inaccurate and doesn't regret anything really material. The Big Five aspect scale is currently viewed as the popular psychometric toolkit or framework. But I should mention, before we go any further, that psychometrics, I think in general there's two interesting things to observe about them, about the whole concept of them. First is that once someone is exposed to the concept of psychometrics, there's a period of infatuation where they tend to overuse it and assume that it is the decoder ring for life.
00:15:23
It does try to take a very high dimensional space, one of the highest dimensions we kind of know, which is the individual and reduce it. And so you get really excited because you think, gosh, the big five aspects scale. I now understand everything. And over time, Azeez, it's funny. My sister's a psychologist and I remember I first came to her many years ago, wild eyed about the big five, she said, and I think she called it something like the Big Five Halo.
00:15:44
And she said, Call me in a year. It'll fade a little bit. And she was very right. Someone listening here. I think you can do quite a bit of researching and Googling. Maybe they'll send around some links after this. But you should realize at the end of the day that there's a modest level of efficacy here. And then the second thing is why is not more kind of efficient and why the science here isn't better, I think is a very interesting reason, like epidemiology.
00:16:06
I think before the coronavirus, there were no free market stressors that were really applied to the validity of psychometrics. And in my humble opinion, if there are no free market stressors, the science is false.
00:16:21
So I think we're realizing a lot of epidemiology and modeling kind of viruses. Just those people don't know what they're talking about now. I don't blame them because capitalism, I find, is gravity that grounds things, that pulls them back down to reality as opposed to the ether of space and ideas. A counterpoint here would be weather forecasting. We know its limitations very accurately. That is because it is grounded in the free market. So psychometrics, with the exception of the military, maybe air traffic control, which happens to use IQ tests and two to three other organizations, is not really grounded in reality, which is one of the reasons why I think Pioneer has been able to make remarkable progress in the field, not because we're that good, but because it's very nascent days, because for the most part, the effect sizes in the world of psychometrics in the big five are extremely light.
00:17:11
The biggest effect size that people are excited about. It is true that I think the R-squared of IQ to earnings is like point six or something, but you're still not explaining a huge amount of variance at that point. But that is the most celebrated effect size. So I think we should be careful when trying to use this. The final thing I should say is I think a lot of these things are useful because of the language that they give people.
00:17:35
And it is useful, I think, after you would meet someone or if you're in your team and you're working and you're trying to discuss someone after the interview, it is useful to have common vernacular in taxonomy about how you describe someone. To that extent, Myers Briggs may be helpful if you all kind of agree on that language. It doesn't matter that the actual test of minus breaks is valid or not. One reason, by the way, why a lot of these tests are just wrong is they're based on self-assessment in self-assessment.
00:18:01
It's such a crazy thing. We're going to ask the person to evaluate themselves at one point in time. Call me at eight o'clock in the morning after a cup of coffee, and I'll give you a very different assessment from two o'clock in the morning about myself.
00:18:12
It seems like the quality of. Persistence becomes incredibly important in all this, especially when you're measuring literal progress in the variety of different ways, whether that's revenue or some of the thing further upstream from revenue inside of a person's project or company. Do you think that persistence is obviously you need some natural aptitude and probably some curiosity, but do you think ultimately persistence might be the most simple way of talking about all this persistence, power or energy or worth?
00:18:39
We frequently use and I think that's important because you need to ensure the person is going to take many shots on goal. It's just your sense of how formidable they are to you. This may be a question you can ask yourself that kind of reflects that on them. I think Paul Graham originally Y Combinator originally said that was one thing he looked for in founders is he wants to walk away from the meeting feeling a little bit afraid. The other thing going on, I think, with persistence or energy is the person is very interested in improving a particular dimension in their company or what have you, because there are performing at the end of the day for someone in particular.
00:19:13
And I think that can give someone a very elongated sense of endurance and persistence. Often you'll meet founders who really look up to other founders or other leaders. If they get stuck in the right feedback loop, they will find themselves very much performing for that individual in a way that's constructive for society. There's also a destructive mechanism of this where people spend a lot of time on Twitter trying to get Ellen to favorite one of their tweets and dopamine hit from that becomes a thing that they chase.
00:19:37
But that's, in my opinion, kind of not that useful for the world. Obviously, like I mentioned, founders are very bad at selecting hierarchies to maximize and very good at maximizing whatever game that they're in. And maximizing status, I think, is a useless hierarchy because it's infinite capital is a great one to maximize precisely because it's scarce. And so you can meet a founder who's going to spend all day trying to get any of your previous guests to, like, re tweet their tweet.
00:20:01
And that will be their entire game in life when they wake up in the morning, that's who they're performing for and that's really what they're trying to do. But I find the best founders through the company, the revenue as the vehicle through which they're performing. And obviously, I think that's a much more healthy because for someone to click like on your tweet, it requires far less effort than parting with something of scarce value, like giving you money for your product.
00:20:23
You mentioned earlier term. And that's my last question on personality side, you mentioned the term that I think our friend Graham was the first one to introduce me to, which is insecure overachiever. Everything you just said makes me think of insecurity and how that gets filled. Do you think, in your experience with all these different pioneers, that insecurity is a good thing or a bad thing?
00:20:41
I definitely think it removes the foundation from the building and it creates a bit more of a shaky atmosphere. I think it can create a lot of energy in someone precisely because, like a molecule searching for a covalent bond, they're going to be looking for someone else to perform for because they have that sense of insecurity and they don't know where they sit in the hierarchy. And they will need to find a way to validate their position, be it in a dinner party or online or with their company.
00:21:07
And so that, I think, is often what creates what propels a lot of that energy. Look, I say this is someone who is slightly insecure myself and think I've got a little bit better at this as I've aged. I actually was commenting to our friend Graham that I think one thing that one transition that one goes through in life certainly that I've observed recently is by developing in some cases a family, in my particular case, a very small set of very close relationships.
00:21:30
Some of that insecurity does tend to go away because what kind of happens is you find your place in your world and you find a hierarchy that you feel like you can sit in comfortably regardless of the actions that you take. But often I actually think this is one of the hidden reasons why immigration works. It is because you take a person out of a hierarchy from one country voluntarily and you shove them into a new hierarchy where they have no idea where they stand.
00:21:53
I think that creates a lot of insecurity. Speak to anyone who came to San Francisco who immigrated here, could be from Wisconsin, could be from India. It doesn't matter. And they have no friends. And so they kind of don't know where they sit in the world because they're in a brand new place. In many ways. I think the story of immigration is the story of someone who is fairly insecure, trying to secure their place in the hierarchy.
00:22:10
And I think that can create greatness. That feedback loop can cut both ways. You can spend a lot of time, as I mentioned earlier, maximizing stupid things. I think the interesting question here, the interesting question is whether you would wish that thing on your children, because I think there's something about the whiplashed story, the insecure overachiever story, which is very good for society, very thrilling for the individual. But there are definitely are ups and downs.
00:22:34
I actually, although I feel somewhat blessed to have this dynamic myself, I feel like it gives me a level of immersion and flow that I couldn't access. I think if I was just more confident in a place in the world, I do wonder if that's something occasionally does cause discomfort.
00:22:48
You mentioned capital is sort of an interesting thing to be optimizing around because of its inherent scarcity. Can you walk us through this concept? You have a fast twitch versus slow twitch capitalism.
00:22:58
It's funny, I speak to a lot of people who are trying to figure out what career to take, especially kind of people on the younger side in life who are trying to figure out if they go into investing or operating a company or working at a company. I feel like there's so much capital sloshing around. There's a lot of. Funds being created, I mean, I think the only thing that would be more common than starting a seed fund is the downloading Tick-Tock.
00:23:21
There's a lot of people stepping into venture that in my personal opinion, I don't think we'll actually be happy as venture managers because venture is kind of this form of slow twitch capitalism where the amount of time it takes for you to get the reward and the amount we were talking earlier about earlier ways of figuring out if you're making progress or not is very unclear in venture what you're doing for a very long time. And it takes a while to figure out if you're decent or not.
00:23:45
There's a lot of people I'm noticing that are mistaking activity for progress. And the way you see this is writing a lot of investments into a lot of different companies. I think in many ways, to fill a void inside themselves should get a sense that they're advancing in the world. But, of course, as we know, small checks into a lot of different companies doesn't really create for a great result. You want to be in an enduring position in the capital, in a small set of companies is far better.
00:24:09
Concentration is a goal. It is not a risk. I think that's because these are people that would be much better suited to kind of fast twitch capitalism, which is, I think a company where there's things changing every day is revenue to be chasing, deals to be had, progress to be made, as opposed to slow twitch metabolism. Could be your other metaphor here, which just takes longer. And I think you have to be slightly more self-assured to do it.
00:24:31
You mentioned, Meems, of fascinating topic and a huge driver of human behavior. What is your thinking here on their importance? They tend to be funny things online, but the funny things we see demonstrate how much a lot of what we do is just copying other people.
00:24:45
What you're thinking on means is very important, I think, to understand in the world for any type of asset allocator or someone running a business, because I think it helps explain a lot of human behavior. I think dissecting them is very interesting. And I think for every particular meme you may want to think about, what is the kind of hole in the world that this thing is filling and why is it possible even something as why has Moccia become popular, something I've been thinking about lately?
00:25:08
What hole void in the world is the McClarty filling?
00:25:12
It's interesting to think about because this wasn't as much as a fad 10 years ago. And now it's certainly an explosive meme. And I think a lot of it, interestingly, is a byproduct of Instagram. I think Instagram, once Instagram got popular, it created a shortage in the world of colorful experiences that were purchasable at a fairly low rate. What is something I can buy that's colorful, that will pop in the Instagram filter? And I think as a result, you started to see a lot of dynamic contrast in colors, purple drinks, green drinks, orange drinks, the McClarty kind of fill that void.
00:25:45
When you walk around the street and you see people order their macho latte, you kind of realize what they're actually doing is they're somewhat following this meme, I think, which wouldn't have gotten popular without Instagram. So being able to dissect these things and kind of understand, I think, the underlying systems behind why humans do really anything I find super useful. I feel like sometimes I'm walking around the world with this little heads up display when I'm able to think this way and really understand the reason behind the reason with all of this as background and backdrop.
00:26:16
So we've got sort of the discussion around Pioneer and urging people to become entrepreneurs, maybe even convincing ones that wouldn't have otherwise to do so. And also this trend of lots of capital in the system, lots of seed funds or really just lots of risk seeking capital with rates so low and I guess easier probably to get funded as an entrepreneur than ever before. With those two things in mind, what are you seeing? That's interesting as themes in the kinds of businesses being founded today?
00:26:43
What is sort of the frontier, if you will, of companies being formed?
00:26:48
Yeah, what I'll say before I get in is what I find so interesting is how rapidly this scene involves founders. Are these migrant species kind of a wildebeest moving from Savannah to Savannah for whatever market is more interesting? And one of the reasons why I think the study of memetics is so important is that can kind of help you predict where things are going to go to. One thing that's quite popular now is there's a lot of people working on various chat aggregation services.
00:27:11
Matrixx is an open source chat ecosystem as part of the ecosystem. There's all sorts of people that have built adapters, things that let you slurp in kind of what's app signal, whatever messaging service used to this kind of federated service. And that's opened the door for, I think, half a dozen or so startups that are kind of experimenting with bringing back and IQ. So that's one fairly active field. The other one is kind of adjacent. That's pretty active.
00:27:35
Now, it's been interesting to watch Enterprise RPA, robotic process automation, which was certainly kind of a celebrated category of twenty, eighteen and 19 feet away and replacement for search. Another thing that's kind of become fairly popular recently is the whole ecosystem around Robin Hood. Obviously, everyone kind of becomes a trader now, but there's a lot of people building the picks and shovels for this Bloomberg for Robin Hood or various trading apps to help people trade better. It kind of remains unclear whether what you really want to be building in this world is a Bloomberg or Reddit, so to speak.
00:28:05
What matters more, whether it's community or tooling, but that's a pretty active scene, the most vibrant scene of activity, which really goes to speak to how startups get created. Is founder solving their own anecdotal problems is there are a ton, ton of people working on various forms of socializing online, really trying to solve the Zoome conundrum, so to speak, which is to say, why is it that meeting a resume is not as good as in the real world?
00:28:28
And how can we make it different and better? A lot of what I would say horseless carriages in this world in the sense that what they are, are people very much trying to recreate the real world on the Internet instead of being Internet first. I think it's very interesting if you look at pretty much any technology, the cars, obviously the famous one of horseless carriage metaphore, pretty much any technology goes through kind of the real world variant of it.
00:28:49
We can kind of think of, I don't know, pen and paper, the first kind of digital form of it, the word processor, and then the kind of fully online variant of it, which would be Google Docs. You could think of an Encyclopedia Britannica online to Wikipedia, same effect. And it feels like a lot of the video conferencing 2.0 stuff is still stuck in the encyclopedia era. No one's really figured out the Wikipedia of that, which I think will look incredibly different from the way it is to interact in the real world.
00:29:14
Those are some interesting categories going on. There's another one started fairly recently, maybe in the past two or three weeks, which is there's a lot of people trying to use three to build various companies.
00:29:24
Can we spend some time in that last one? We're recording this on the one it was announced or released, but fairly recent over the last couple of weeks. Can you describe what three is? It is equal parts, thrilling, interesting, maybe scary. Describe where it came from, what it is, and then we'll talk about building companies on top of it.
00:29:43
We can use the tools we discussed earlier to view the lens of DPG three, which is to say, I do think it is a meme. In all honesty, if you haven't heard of three, I'd be very curious to talk to you because that must mean you're in a very different orbit than mine, because that's all my world says. So at the end of the day, JP three is a machine learning model that's been developed by open eye that's achieved a remarkable advance in the field of natural language understanding from writing essays to summarizing text to doing question answering two three is not quite like a human, but it's surprisingly close.
00:30:10
One simple metaphor for someone to beat. It's kind of just assumed that three has added and it's able to understand text a very shallow depth so it can produce and understand things like tweets or maybe a paragraph or two. If you asked three to kind of understand something of any deeper knowledge, it tends to really go off the rails in interesting ways, but it really goes off the rails. It can do things that shallow depth, much like images, require kind of shallow depth of attention.
00:30:36
Beyond that, I think it still fails. I think it is extremely interesting to think about and we'll talk about business applications for GPG three in a moment. But it is extremely interesting to ponder if one assumes that theory is overhyped, why exactly it is overhyped?
00:30:50
What is causing this level of hype and insanity? And one simple explanation is, I do think much like the latest, we're providing a product in a shortage of colorfulness in the world. GPG three is providing technological advance in a world that's short of it. We've yet to see something kind of big and new in the world of technology, maybe since the iPhone and this is kind of close to it, a computer that can write text that resembles a human is kind of close to it.
00:31:14
And so as a result, people are quite excited about it. The other thing going on with three is especially if you kind of look online, it's very easy for people to experiment with opening. I didn't just release kind of a research paper that no one could use. They actually released a nice little website where you could kind of toyed with the model and speak to it. And the results it produces, I would say maybe six times out of ten are bad, but the four times out of ten you cherry pick and you post on Twitter and you get reaction from people.
00:31:41
It's almost a tool of creativity in that sense. And that really created a tremendous amount of hype and excitement around it. I think it's a good thing for the world. By the way, regardless of whether the product is under hyped or overhyped, the hype will lead to capital investment, will lead to more people working on this. And I can tell you, as someone who ran a search and machine learning at Apple for quite some time, there were real problems in that space that if we solve, could unlock tremendous amounts of societal and economic progress.
00:32:04
So I really hope more people focus and spend their time on it. I think a very interesting question is to the extent to which you would wants to build a real business on top of three and exactly how so example businesses have been there's some interesting demos you can see online of someone typing in a bunch of words like give me an interface with a table with two buttons at the bottom I can click on. And three can produce not just English language, but also programming language.
00:32:29
So it's able to produce that interface. And that's very kind of exciting as a demo. Actually, I think the interesting question is, will this be kind of a disruptive innovation, one that startups will be able to take advantage of? Or is this such an obvious thing that it will be a sustaining innovation for the large companies? You could imagine someone creating a, say, a Shopify clone, or you just have to mudar set up website for me that looks at particular way and it just automatically happens versus kind of Shopify just doing that.
00:32:57
That is, I think, the first way in which I'd kind of wonder whether these startups using GBG three are good or not. The second more interesting question is whether they'll just be tons of three nouse their various numbers online. You could read about how much money this thing took to create. It's all in the ballpark of single digit millions. And you can envision pretty much. Every large company under the Sun may be training their own similar model now, so very rapidly evolving landscape.
00:33:19
Certainly a lot of people working on it remains unclear whether this is going to be the type of thing that's going to be like, say, mobile banking, which is very much a sustaining innovation for the big guys versus a huge disruptive innovation like Uber or insta coming out of mobile on the sort of the opposite end of the complexity spectrum is a great post that you've put up called the Power of 10 Playbook, which I think is a nice little ode to not thinking too big, too soon and a great way to get started on a project which my experience in covid so far.
00:33:48
I'm curious if it's yours as well. It's like almost everyone I know is trying something new as a side project, as maybe even a new career. They have extra time. They're not commuting, whatever the reasons are. And I love this little playbook.
00:33:59
Could you describe why you wrote it and sort of what you mean by it when someone is going to be very interesting here in hindsight? Because we've run this kind of great a big test of what the world looks like if we kind of turn everyone into dropouts. And if you're in university literally, or I mean, even if you're attending Zoome school, you're kind of a dropout. You don't really have to go anywhere. So classes are not being taught significant uptick in startup activity.
00:34:20
I think super interesting. Hopefully good. That blog post that I wrote is kind of just an attempt of mine to distill or maybe simplify the steps that one might take in starting a company. So we kind of touched on this earlier. But broadly speaking, you can kind of imagine the world getting split into two jobs that have very clear set of next steps, working in the military, working at Starbucks or working as a manager in a large company, clear jobs.
00:34:43
And then you've got opaque jobs. And I think starting a company is an incredibly opaque job. It's very unclear what to do next. It's very unclear if you're starting a business, how it's going to become stripe or how it's going to become Airbnb. That seems like an unfathomable goal. In all honesty, even getting to like, I don't know, one hundred thousand dollars in revenue feels like an unfathomable.
00:34:59
So I think it's very important to break these things down into bite sized steps. And that post is really just an attempt to do that. It seems very hard and very achievable to run a marathon, but it also seems very achievable to run two hundred meters. And a good running program will kind of give you the step by step way to get there so that at some point, if you really want to, you find yourself running a marathon and you find your company doing tens of millions of dollars in revenue.
00:35:22
And it really starts with just trying to get a small set of people, initially just 10, which I think is a very achievable goal, a group of 10 people that are avidly using a product. This is important for two reasons. One is it'll enable you to run the process of discovery around what's wrong in your product and what's right. I have not yet to see a case where without consulting anyone in the world, someone creates something and it's instantly successful overnight.
00:35:46
Maybe Bitcoin is the only example of this. No consultation. Just put it out there and it works. The one thing you'll get out of it is ten people. You'll be able to refine what you're building and you'll be able to search the space of kind of product improvement and hopefully good way. The second thing that's very important, that's an underrated reason is you'll find yourself becoming more motivated to work on the product if it's ten people, ideally, that you respect because you wants to be able to serve them in an interesting way.
00:36:10
We often find at Pioneer that that alone is the catalyzing feedback loop to getting something going. It's not even revenue. It's just getting the attention of ten people that like what you're building. Once you go to ten, you can try to go to one hundred, which kind of the next step. And once you go to one hundred, you can try to get to maybe a thousand dollars and recurring revenue. What I find so hopefully compelling about this concept is it's extremely inexcusable to say I can't get ten users.
00:36:33
I mean, everyone's got to be able to find ten people. The Internet has billions of them. The attempt was really to distill kind of this unknown, fairly opaque thing to a simple set of goals that I think anyone can use to kind of get started. And starting in an online business that hopefully goes somewhere. It's worth mentioning that I feel like a lot of founders forget that everything big starts small.
00:36:51
The reason people forget this is there's media teams responsible for making sure you forget this. The first thing you do after the company successful is you hire folks in kind of comms and marketing and they'll do an excellent job of rewriting your origin story. So that it sounds like from the moment you were six, you were working on whatever it is, Microsoft or Amazon.com or Facebook, and this is your life's mission to connect people, whatever, whatever, whatever. I find it very strange thing to go look at early variants of websites of Amazon.com.
00:37:17
You can watch some of the interviews with Mark Zuckerberg from twenty five where he says there's no reason Facebook should expand beyond the scope of Harvard. Even Space X with all of its MIT, SpaceX with all of its might, was originally conceived as I believe, the Green Mars Oasis project, which I'll describe to you. It sounds like something you do when you're in L.A. The idea was, hey, let's go buy some Russian rockets, launch them into Mars.
00:37:40
We'll just get a photo of a green planet on Mars and then we'll shut down the company. That's it. It's a giant photo stunt, which at the end of the day is slightly ambitious, but it's not the ambition of we're going to create interplanetary travel, the largest private space company in the world, and migrate the entire human population to another planet. That was not the goal. The goal was, let's get a nice photo on Mars. So you got to remember everything big starts small.
00:38:03
And that post was really meant to help distill that for people and give them a bit of a framework there.
00:38:08
One of the interesting transitions happening you and I were chatting about tick tock a little bit is indicative of. This trend that I think you've written about elsewhere, too, which is the notion of technologies kind of starting at a frontier, becoming what we call technology, but then eventually becoming a utility. Most people don't think of today's utilities as yesterday's technologies, but they were. Can you talk about that general transition, that general lifecycle of a piece of technology or railroad or something else and how it relates to some of the giant, what we still call technology companies of today, maybe with Tic-Tac as an example, I enjoy reading a lot of old news.
00:38:41
I find that at the end of the day, the world moves in cycles. And the tricky thing is the length of the cycle seems to be just ever so slightly longer than the length of the human lifespan. So it seems really new novel to us, but it's exactly what people went through in prior times. And we don't read old news because I don't know why new news seems more important. I find old news is a great decoder ring to life in particular.
00:39:01
You can read quite a bit about the terminology used to describe the Vanderbilt railroad empire, the Rockefeller oil empire, very much as technology. Obviously, cars were considered technology, roads were considered technology. I mean, if you go back far enough, maps are considered as technology. So technology, I think, is really just our way of saying the new thing. And there's a lot of businesses and I feel like what kind of what we're watching now?
00:39:22
If we look at the fights going on with Twitter, adding various tags around Trump's tweets or what's about to happen to tick tock is what we call technology businesses today. A lot of them, especially the consumer facing ones, are effectively media businesses, their media businesses, just like CNN is when something moves from this era of being, say, a frontier technology. Some point was cars. At some point it was social networking to a utility, to something that's very popular.
00:39:47
First of all, the wording around it, I think needs to change, although this lag. So you'd really, again, want to think about Facebook and Twitter as media businesses with all the upsides and downsides to it and talk about how this folds into tech talk in a minute. But second, I think this means that they're going to have all the pros and cons of what a utility is. And if you think about, say, PG&E or any other type of utility, the cons are, for the most part, aggressively regulated.
00:40:11
It is nationalized or at least federalized or mandated statewide. The pros are it's usually that regulatory lock in creates kind of a mode of sorts. You can't start another PG&E tomorrow. And I think over time we'll probably evolve into a world where it'll be hard to start something that has the shape of Facebook if they really manage to get the kind of regulatory lock in the regulators and weirdly, Facebook want. So they're kind of pro and cons both ways. But we are in this kind of interesting interstitial era where I think the world thinks that these media businesses are technology.
00:40:42
Businesses are in kind of that middling phase you described where they are, in fact, total utilities. One distillation of this, I think what's going to happen to Tock, which is tremendously popular, there's actually a tremendous amount of US dollars invested in the entity. But as I understand, it is a Chinese entity and it's kind of rapidly unfolding. But there are quite a few parties that are working on transitioning ticktock into an American entity because the United States has banned Tic-Tac, at least in the military.
00:41:08
India has banned it across its entire country. On the one hand, I feel I can speak to a lot of people that say that's crazy, what's happening? We're banning websites. On the other hand, if you think of Tic-Tac as a utility, the United States is not going to let Chinese entity run its power grid. It's not going to let a Chinese entity run 5G, certainly. So it's not going to let a Chinese entity run one of the kind of largest media companies.
00:41:27
The end of the day, either the thing will get totally banned in the United States, which I highly doubt, or it'll have to split off and become somewhat of an American entity. And I think, weirdly, this is a if everyone thinks this is bad for the capital kind of stock in the company, but it's, of course, always a great thing. One of the greatest things that ever happened to any other previous technology monopoly is that get some type of lock in by the regulator, the banks in the 18th, 19th century or oil in the early 20th.
00:41:53
So that to me is a very interesting lens to view tech right now. And I think the asset allocator, of course, wants to think about how do I avoid the utilities and how do I find the things that are either a frontier market or kind of a commercial market right now. And I think there's a lot of interesting activity in everything from satellites in space, I think remain mystifyingly unregulated. I think there is will be a huge war in the years to come between Starlink and go just about the airwaves.
00:42:19
But I think right now it's total open season. And to me, by the way, this is astonishing. It is astonishing that Elon is going to be able to, with Starlink effectively provide Internet to the world in a way that is almost impossible to regulate. And no one's really thinking about it that way. But when you think about it, he's going to put Internet in the air. There's no towers you have to manage, there's no cable and you have to lay.
00:42:40
It's literally going to be in the air. So that's a great example, I think, of an underrated frontier market.
00:42:44
Why in that specific example, why can't it be regulated? And also, what do you think it enables? Is that the equivalent of what everyone always talks about around like platform shifts that create the introduction of the iPhone or something that creates an enormous opportunity to build stuff on top of in your mind to something like Starlink represent that sort of platform shift, assuming it's not regulated out of existence or something to questions there in terms of why can't be regulated.
00:43:10
I mean, I think it can be regulated by convenience. Great. Firewall in China is an interesting example. Yes, technically, you can bypass the Great Firewall. It's not hermetic in many ways you don't. And so that gives a huge edge to, obviously, Chinese companies. And so I think you could do similar things with Starlink, where, for example, you could ban the sale of, say, receivers in a particular country and you have people so smuggle them in.
00:43:31
But the convenience factor matters much more. It's hard to regulate iridium. It's hard to regulate something that is just in the air in terms of it being disruptive. Yeah, one of the most interesting questions I find right now in disruptions, we can think of consumptive ways they'll disrupt the industry. But nonconsumption is always the most interesting form of disruption. This is the Kristiansen framework, obviously nonconsumption or new use cases that we couldn't have thought of before, that just really change everything.
00:43:55
And I don't exactly understand what the nonconsumption just around satellite Supercheap satellite launch will be, but it feels like there's a lot of interesting things there. If you could launch satellites, I believe in Iridium satellite launches, maybe 50 million dollars or so. And with Starship, I think a space satellite launch is maybe fifty thousand dollars. So it's very interesting to think of what goes up in space and how that whole thing unfolds. If it's that cheap to launch things.
00:44:21
Satellites, Internet satellites feel like the most obvious use case initially, but certainly not long term. I imagine weird stuff will come out of it. Would have been hard, I think, to predict Hueber when the mobile phone came out. Very easy to think of order a taxi on your phone, not kind of increase the TAM of the market like Uber did. And I wonder what that will be for satellites. And I think there's a different question, which is for someone allocating capital to it.
00:44:43
What is the payback period and to what extent is this kind of something that would be kind of infrastructure investment versus venture capital investment? That's a whole other question, but I very much believe that the kind of next decade we can think of the twenty, twenty to twenty thirty, that will be the decade of Starlink of satellites into space.
00:44:58
One final question on the ecosystem in which you operate and then my traditional closing question. So first, the final question on the venture ecosystem. You mentioned the amount of capital sloshing about down there, a little bit about this notion you have of a seed versus leach ratio in the venture world and how you see that evolving.
00:45:16
First question we must ask ourselves is, is the venture game a game of is it a pikas game or is it an access game? That's kind of the first question. Of course, the answer is as you go across the table, you kind of see a shift, maybe an inverse U. Shaped curve. As you can imagine very early on, it's a big risk game, meaning, for example, with Pioneer extremely early, we can kind of pick whoever we want very late stage in the cap table.
00:45:37
It's also a picker's game. I mean, obviously, the company's public, for the most part, hedge funds are kind of in the game of picking up the game of excess. But at the A and the B, it is very much a game of access. You know, the good companies are known. And the main question is, can you get into a company? And and I think if you're kind of investor, you have to realize where you're playing and you have to develop different competencies based on where you're going to play.
00:45:58
And I think if you are going to play in the access game, it is very interesting to think of in my head the way it's distilled, this kind of your seed leach ratio in the venture world. Anyone who kind of grew up with BitTorrent would recognize that it used to be all these BitTorrent communities. And BitTorrent is somewhat similar to venture where where access is constrained in the sense that all of these communities, there's a limited amount of certain resource.
00:46:22
The latest TV episode that you want to watch and all these communities would have a leach ratio that they would assign to you based on how much you're contributing to the network. That is to say how much you're allowing other people to upload your copy of that TV show versus how much you're leeching, how much you're taking away from the network. And I find this kind of an interesting way to view relationships in general. And I think it's very important to Inventure to kind of think about it this way, because you are going to want to have good relationships because you need to get invited to the party in order to win.
00:46:51
You want to be that person that is voluntarily kind of given access because there's a scarce resource. I've been thinking a lot lately about kind of what a good seed to leach ratio is. And a very simple way of quantifying this is you can kind of think of friends, people you interact with and kind of think of the number of interactions you have with them where you don't want anything from you or they're kind of giving you something or they're kind of just positive.
00:47:15
There's nothing there that they're leeching from versus the number of interactions where they're actually leeching something where they want something from you.
00:47:23
And it's very much my goal as an individual to not have to have a lot of interactions where I have a very high ratio, where I always want something from someone, because I don't think those are fun. You kind of think of in the back of your mind the people who have a bad ratio there. I feel like I see this a lot in the venture world where every interaction I have with the person, they always want something from me. Behind the scenes, it leads to very genuine unfun conversations.
00:47:44
In my opinion. You kind of think of this conversation that we're having now. There's nothing we really want for each other. We're just trying to kind of have a good time. And I think that's what creates flow. And I think if you want to engineer success for yourself in this market, I think the place I try to be is very much to not have interactions where I really want things from people. For the most part, this doesn't work.
00:48:04
I mean, to the extreme, the end of the day, if you work at a company, obviously occasionally you have you need things from people. So it's a bit of a different dynamic. But you can think of friends as the. Tail end of this friends are people where you almost never have interactions, where you're leeching from them, it's always your seeding, there's no goal. You don't really want anything from them. And so I very much strive to try to be that person kind of in all interactions.
00:48:26
The other way of distilling this in your mind is kind of thinking Skrull, kind of your WhatsApp, your message or whatever for the people that you're almost always invited to the party. And what are the properties of those people, I wonder? There's a lot, because at least this insecure overachievers attempt to be a good actor in the world and kind of have a sense that I stand in a decent spot in mankind's hierarchy, I would like to know that it would be that person.
00:48:50
I know I'm certainly not always there, but I'm striving to be. So I kind of find this concept of just making sure you have a good kind of seed to leech ratio with people to be an important one.
00:48:58
In that sense, it's a fascinating way to look at so many different things. Maybe not public markets, as you said, so much where you can get what you want if you're willing to pay the market price. But every other kind of investing and relationships. This seems like a great concept. Reminds me of I think it's Adam Grant's book, Give and Take a wonderful closing concept. My closing question for everybody is to ask for the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you.
00:49:20
By the way, it's worth thinking, dissecting for a moment why this question is so good and why it works. I think for any interview question, I think it's worth wondering that. I think in my view, as you ask it, there's two things going on. One is it's novel. Most people don't ask this to use the word kindness, and that kind of relaxes the environment a little bit. I've never thought about the question itself.
00:49:41
And before you answer it, I'm just curious if there are other questions that have a similar quality or other qualities that you find good or helpful. I guess I'm basically just asking you, what are some good questions? I mean, this is the secret to life. I will share one, which is how do you think this conversation is going? I love that question.
00:50:00
I think it was you that introduced me to it maybe a year ago or something like that. And I've used it constantly ever since. And the reason I love it is because it is so hard to hide from you have to say something that's interesting or like has some weight to it. It's very hard to to say it's going OK. You just don't say that. You either say it's going great and describe why you say it's not going great and feel the need to really defend that opinion by being very specific, which is why I love that question.
00:50:31
I'm curious if you like it for the same reason or for a different reason.
00:50:33
I think there's a lot of fun things going on with that question. I mean, it does kind of make you smile and laugh. And that is, I think, the most important thing it does. It breaks the fourth wall in the interview, which I think is your only goal in the interview. Break the fourth wall. There's a ethereal quality to it, which is what you're kind of saying is look at us. And the game that we're in is in this kind of silly.
00:50:53
I think that very much relaxes, especially a candidate who's probably nervous. Second is. Yeah, I mean, obviously, it causes the person to kind of introspect and in kind of a new way they haven't done before. The third is my way of thinking of your third point. It is impossible to not have an answer about it. It's got to be a cached answer. I mean, it's an experience. You just went through one mistake. I think a lot of people making interviews as they ask questions for people that are novel and surprising that the person feels like they have to be performative in their answer.
00:51:22
The old Peter Teeley question about what's an area in which you disagree with the world when a person asks you that? I think the one flaw in that question, I mean, it's become too popular. But the one flaw in that question is there's a performative aspect to the answer. So you don't really get a genuine sense of the person. Whereas how do you think this interview is going? How do you think this conversation is going? It doesn't sound too intellectual, and I think that's very important.
00:51:44
If you really want to klodt, what makes the human genuine? This is the other reason why tying this back to our initial kind of debate around films, that's a very easy thing to kind of get a sense of the person. What are some films that you like because it's disarming.
00:51:57
Are there any other questions for you that are on your personal Mount Rushmore of questions that you think you'll find use for forever? Like I do the kindness question and then we'll come back to that question.
00:52:07
There is one question that Pioneer asks that's been the most revealing question period. We collect a lot of these qualitative questions in addition to kind of the quantitative data, didn't try and see like which question is predictive. And probably the most predictive one we have is what is something weird or unusual you built or did early on in life? I find it so astonishing in how poller it is. Someone will tell you about accidentally got my high school teacher fired and then someone will say something incredibly bland.
00:52:34
I did a ten mile hike to me. It really explains people. And again, it's worth thinking about why that question works. I'm asking you for something factual. I'm not asking you to think or be highfalutin with your hoity toity intellectual concepts. So something factual, something simple, you can give me an earnest answer. It shouldn't take too long to think of. And yeah, really kind of give me a sense of who you are to kind of round out the idea.
00:52:57
We're talking about interviews mostly, or I guess maybe references would be another category. The reason that all these questions are interesting is what you're trying to get at some underlying substrate of the person, their attitude. Why are these so interesting to us questions? I'm trying to understand ideally even better than you completely understand why you're doing what you're doing. I don't think I'm any brilliant person. I actually think other people could understand about me why I do what I do better than I can.
00:53:23
One of the greatest lies is when people tell you why they did certain things. I'll speak for myself. If you were to ask me why exactly did you leave Apple when you did or why did you sell your company? I don't know that I could give you the real answer. What I'm going to do is I'm going to give you an intellectualized answer. I thought about that. I think you'd be interested in hearing so funny when you talk to people about why did you leave Job X and go to job Y, I felt I wasn't learning enough.
00:53:47
Do you really have, like, a daily learning number that you put next to every diary entry and the learning number was low? So is that really why you left or is it something deeper? Is what happened that I don't know. You bumped into someone at the barbecue and they mentioned their salary and your salary was lower. And then for three months, this was in your head that your salary wasn't what it was supposed to be. And at some point, the email came in from the recruiter and inspiration struck.
00:54:11
Or was it that you had some conversation with your wife and went down some rabbit hole and you realized in the conversation that you just really don't like your boss?
00:54:20
The stated reason for things with humans is almost never the real reason, and it's often a third party, ideally people much smarter than me. I hope that can figure out what it is. And in an interview, what I'm trying to figure out is if it's a founder that we're meeting or whether it's someone we're hiring to work at Pioneer, I'm trying to figure out why are you doing this and what's driving you? And I find ways to get there are asking simple questions that the person can answer without needing to perform.
00:54:49
The person is working against you when they start performing. By the way, another tactic I'll occasionally use is I tell people, especially now, a resume where there's a bit more of a disconnect. I tell people up front, please stop performing and just be yourself with me and I will try to do the same with you. Very simple. Other thing I highly recommend doing on this front, repeat the same question over and over again until you get the answer.
00:55:12
I think a lot of people walk into interviews and they have this rubric of questions they need to ask. Maybe their boss gave it to them and they ask the question, they get the answer and then they move on. There was literally no entropy exchange. Like the question was, what is your biggest weakness? The answer was, I work too hard. And then you moved on. You might as well have not had a conversation. That's what a draining conversation is, in my opinion.
00:55:33
It's that you are eating up oxygen without any novelty in it. I very much try to not have those, partially because I'm trying to understand the person, partially because nobody wants to be bored.
00:55:43
I have a friend who says society and its trimmings are only three days deep meeting. If you're kind of by yourself in the wilderness or something for three days and all sorts of falls away. And I like this version of it, which is the truth is only three answers away, three questions away. Rather, it's a neat concept. I'm forced now to return to my actual question. I do love I've never explained this before, but since we're talking about questions, I do love asking it just because it makes me happy at the end of interviews.
00:56:08
It's not more complicated than that. And I think that orienting and priming people around some act of kindness is a great way to close. So I'm curious for your answer to the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you.
00:56:19
OK, so a bit of a recency bias, but something that's been on my mind almost every single day. A couple of weekends ago, I drove my car to the middle of nowhere in California. I was pretty warm, like the car in the side of the road. I don't really pay attention to where I parked it. I locked the door, put my keys in my pocket, and I go out for a run and I come back to the car.
00:56:36
Twelve miles, 12, 14 miles later are pretty dehydrated. I didn't bring any water with me. It's maybe ninety five degrees and I'm pretty excited to get into the car, turn on the air conditioning, drink some water and get back home. I then discovered that the car had sunk into the ground a little bit. It's kind of very thin sand. I turn on the car and start the engine and at the gas and dig a great ditch for myself.
00:57:00
Situation becomes a little bit more alarming when I realized the car has almost no fuel left literally in the middle of nowhere in California. I really treated myself here and I thought I was screwed, but it only took maybe, I don't know, 10, 12 minutes until someone's driving by on the road and they drive by. And then they passed me and then they turn around. Lo and behold, over the course of the next 30, 40 minutes or so, three people stopped their car, kind of turned around and helped me to my car out of the sand.
00:57:26
And to me, this is like so simple but so momentous for me. I truly had begun thinking basically that I'm stuck here and I'm going to make camp here for the next three days. But the fact that people went out of their way to help me, here's the interesting thing that I find in it now. Every time I'm driving on any type of road in particular, if it's desolate and I see someone stuck, I have a real proclivity to try to help them because I was helped.
00:57:52
And I think that small effect in many ways describes the magic of Silicon Valley. Someone took a bet on me when I was 18 years old. And you kind of see now in my career, I'm trying to take other bets on people. So there's a real pay it forward element I think happens to when you shower someone with an excessive amount of with a surprising amount, we should say, of. Effort when they feel like they don't deserve it, so I don't know, that's the most common thing people have done to me, but that's a pretty big one.
00:58:18
I love it.
00:58:18
So many of the answers come down to the same thing you said earlier around seed and Leech, that fundamentally they're all seeding activities.
00:58:27
It's a great place to close every time we talk. I feel like I take away 15 fun devices, new bits of learning, new ideas. You're always full of them. And so I'd love to have finally been able to do this on the record. I'm sure it'll be the first of several.
00:58:41
Thanks for your time. Thank you so much. I enjoyed it as well.
