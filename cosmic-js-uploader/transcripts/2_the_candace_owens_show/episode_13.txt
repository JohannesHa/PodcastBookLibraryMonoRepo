00:00:08
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. We're going to get into it, we're going all of it. Let's do it. All right, guys, let me know we're speeding. I'm going to do a soft intro and then I'll turn to you. OK? OK, ladies and gentlemen, we are rolling into another episode of the Kandace Owens Show. There is a meme that I love about covid-19 is a patient going to their doctor and they ask the doctor, doctor, how long will these lockdown's last?
00:00:35
To which the doctor replies, How am I supposed to know I'm a doctor, not a politician?
00:00:41
And I thought that was so hilarious and spot on.
00:00:44
Given everything we have seen with covid-19, it seems that this this virus is quite political, quite divisive and interesting, because you would think that we'd be allowed to hear more than one perspective from a doctor. No matter what you have, you're allowed to see another doctor for a different opinion.
00:01:01
But what has been so unique about covid-19 is that we have seen doctors censored, doctors shut down, doctors libelled, doctors smeared for having the wrong opinion.
00:01:15
I have one such doctor with me today, Dr. Stella Emanuel, a physician in Texas. Welcome to the Candesartan Show.
00:01:23
Thank you for having me. I'm really honored to be here and I love you. So I think we're going to have fun. I think we will. I remember seeing this video and I'm just trying to jog the memory of my viewers.
00:01:34
There was a video that went absolutely viral, and it was right around the time where no one was allowed to go against the mainstream narrative. And we're all going to die from covid-19. And they're acting like this is the bubonic plague. And there was a coalition of doctors standing and talking about their experiences actually treating covid-19 patients and which you sort of led the charge and said that you were having a tremendous amount of success treating patients with hydroxy chloroquine.
00:02:04
And wow. Yeah, that was a watershed moment. It was a watershed moment. Basically, before then, everybody I would say the whole world was locked down in fear. The whole world, you know, because in the history of viral videos, initially when we started out, it was like doctors and invaders and they practically just clipped my clip and kept shooting it over and over. And Facebook jumped on. It was taking it down to the lowest it can be done.
00:02:28
YouTube, was it down? The media took it down, off early went.
00:02:31
So that was that was the thing is like I hadn't even I hadn't even thought to watch the video and then because it was censored, so and I thought to myself, why would doctors be censored?
00:02:41
I want to then go pursue the video. And people were emailing it around too. So forget the social media. It was going viral. Yeah, watch this. I'm taking this down.
00:02:51
You're taking it down. It was it was it was an amazing moment. But, you know, let me kind of see how you build it up to. Yeah. You know, I trained I'm from Cameroon, West Africa. I've been in this country for about twenty eight years. I trained in Nigeria, Calabar, University of Calabar. I took care of patients with ah, we use chlorine mefloquine, Gummow Queen. We use most of the Queen's to give them to pregnant women, to children, to babies, to old people.
00:03:18
So these are things that I'm used to. In fact, back home, my parents used to give it to us, as we call it, sun, sun medicine, every every West African. You know what I mean? With a yes on the Sun Medicine Saturday Sun Medicine, Sun Sun Medicine for malaria. So we took it for malaria prophylaxis and everybody took it on Sunday. My my parents right now, during the late seventies, they are actually on they've been taking it for like they've been taking Flavell Queen for four years just to stop to prevent malaria.
00:03:43
So it was something that I was used to. It wasn't something that just came out of the rabbit hole. So because some people like, well, you go just Taraba hydroxyl glucan and jumped on it. But so when covid started, I was in Texas. I mean, my my career kind of went all over the place. I practiced I did general medicine in Africa when I came here, the first residency I got into was pediatrics. So I did pediatrics.
00:04:09
But when I finished my residency in pediatrics in New York, I moved to Louisiana and I opened a pediatric practice. And then I started working in the emergency room. Give my general practice skills, not just keeping general practice skills, becoming really skilled in taking care of a generally sick patients. So I've been doing that for years. In fact, for the past four years, I actually stopped practice clinic practice and I just did it for about three years.
00:04:35
About this time last year, I opened a practice in Texas. And I think that, you know, I'm also, you know, I'm a preacher, so everything in my life is kind of planned. You know, people think I just showed up. I didn't just show up. Well, I don't even bother to show up to be a doctor. So any idea that you came out of nowhere, I mean, it is not easy to become a doctor.
00:04:53
It's certainly not easy when you're starting your career in Cameroon, Africa and then coming into America. Not a very easy transition. Yes. You've got you've got so many barriers ahead of you. You come to this country, you do residency, you do the right thing. It's not. So any person pretending you came out of nowhere and apparently it's not a real doctor because she has an accent.
00:05:13
I say, and it's not funny. I mean, I just told him that that's OK. I downloaded my certificate. Of line. Yeah, that's true. I'm not a doctor, I just downloaded it online or something. I play one on TV just back off.
00:05:26
Yeah, it's been it's been a lot. So and then, of course, on the spiritual side, I've actually been praying on fighting for America. If people look back at messages of five years ago, I'm talking about messages like, you know, fighting for the soul of America. I've been praying for this nation for years. We didn't just show up. When you say we've been praying for the ministry, I mean, I'm a part of our ministry and our ministry members are like all over the nation, all over the country.
00:05:51
We have a prayer line that we've run for like 12 years every night. We've run that line every single night for 12 years. And we've been praying for the nation. We've been standing in the gap year. So when this happened, it happened because it was planned. You know how it is that we've been preparing all your life for something. And then when he drops, everybody's like, oh, my God, where did you come from? I've been trained for this.
00:06:12
I've been prepared for this. When I told people that, you know, I had an interview, they're like, oh, my God, they're going to come after you. I said, no, they won't. I'm God's battleaxe on weapon of war. I'm trained for this. Right. You know, I'm not I didn't just show up. I'm not scared of any of these people. I'm not scared of this Diabolik.
00:06:29
But I do.
00:06:29
And I also do want to point out the fact and I always say this is just the difference in the fear factor that I think we Americans have, which is perhaps due to just the remarkable privilege that were afforded in this country versus going to an African country and seeing what people have to deal with.
00:06:48
Like you said, we've taken malaria pills since we were children. I mean, the diseases are rampant.
00:06:52
They're right. And so the idea that you would buck and be fearful when you hear about covid-19, you're like, I was I was unprepared for this moment.
00:06:59
I'm ready to fight, you know.
00:07:01
And, you know, a lot of doctors in America are kind of scared, of course, because everywhere he is hyper specialized, everybody is hyper specialists. And a lot of the doctors are saying that all this doesn't work. They all have like exotic specialties like, you know, plastic surgery. And, you know, and like, you know, dermatology. They don't see patients, covid patients. I've never seen any, you know, so of course, they are scared.
00:07:22
Yeah. About the here the narrative of, oh, this medication would kill you and and good. But I mean, it's like one of the most I would say is one of the most safest medications. Yeah.
00:07:33
Now let me and I'm pulling this from a book I read a while ago, but this is the origins of hydroxy chloroquine. It comes from the bark of right in the Amazon. And they use this literally actually when when colonialists were trying to get into Africa and they were dying, thousands of them kept dying because they kept catching malaria. They eventually discovered in this bark that they could take this and it would make them immune to malaria. So this has been around for forever.
00:07:57
Very, very, very long time.
00:08:00
OK, so it's been so it was kind of a little puzzling to me. I remember my mom telling me, oh, it's chloroquine now different in America because I hear disease is dangerous. These are not the same thing we've been taking you for a long time, you know, so we had all this going on. So when covid hit it, you know, I was in Texas in February about a good maybe 15 to 20 percent of my patients come from the Middle East, you know, and I was really scared.
00:08:28
We got all I mean, if you see these videos we did earlier, we looked like people from space. We had the spaceship thing going on, you know, white suits, we got Tyvek suits, everything. We had everything. We're prepared not to get this disease. And a pharmacist called me and told me that, you know what, they're using Hydroxycut in Europe and we're getting news coming out of China using us. OK, wow, that's amazing because we know this drug.
00:08:51
So, of course, I went to dig a little further, find out that there was an article in 2005 that was written on the Anthony Foushee that this medication works not only work, it also the mechanism of action. It it prevents viral uptake.
00:09:06
Hold on. Hold on vacation. I want to go back to that. You're saying that you went back and you found an article from Doctor and it was from the NIH on that Dr. Anthony Fauci.
00:09:16
He's under under Dr. Anthony Fauci from the NIH saying this drug hydroxy chloroquine works. Yes.
00:09:23
What to do? What works for covid? For sars-cov-2? Not only do you work very well, in fact, he there was an article. He himself said it actually was a treatment and a treatment and a vaccine because no one is stopping the optic of the virus. It stops replication and it stops it opens in general and allows them to come into the job.
00:09:48
So I just learned about this. That would seem like some really big breaking mainstream media news. Why am I just hearing about this?
00:09:55
Because I don't want anybody to know. OK, so when then, of course, I went on dug into this actually an article on the Harrison Book of Medicine. I've forgotten what edition it was. And it was actually the whole mechanism of action of the of Tolkien was in the on covid and on coronaviruses. And, you know, sometimes I say this is a novel virus. This is a virus. It's not just. It's not so novel. This is a coronavirus, we've had them around for years.
00:10:23
This is a different story. So different in versus the flu is a coronavirus. A lot of the common cause we have is a coronavirus, Yagoona viruses. So when I saw this, I was excited. So, of course, I jumped into it and I started treating patients. I initially just took the malaria dose and tweaked it. So the combination that we use is hydroxy chloroquine, as it were, Meyssan, zinc, vitamin D and vitamin C.
00:10:46
And it was amazing. The results were incredible. If somebody's coming within two days of being sick and I put them on Hydroxycut and Zinc and vitamin C, they got better within like 24 hours and 48 hours. This were like amazing results. So, I mean, it was it was so amazing. I was so excited. So I went on Facebook and I started talking on our doctor groups. I said, oh, my God, I'm using Hydroxycut.
00:11:08
It's working. The patients are getting better.
00:11:10
So you're being a doctor going. My job is to heal people. I'm using this. I found these articles that were done and the and the the under the NIH is the NIH at the NHS, the NIH.
00:11:22
And here we go. This is amazing. This is great news. I actually want to preach. Everybody should want this. And at the same time, this was back in the time actually when people were very fearful and didn't know answers. Interestingly enough, and I simply remember this in Nevada, the governor then after the president says, you know, Hydroxycut can works, they stop allowing doctors to prescribe it.
00:11:43
That seems like a very weird thing to do, because now I'm asking, Mr. Doctor, if I'm let's say I am healthy and I start taking hydroxyl chloracne, anything bad going to happen to me?
00:11:54
I'm not really actually good for you. It has a lot of protective side effects. It's not if you are healthy.
00:12:01
I mean, we took it as prophylaxis.
00:12:04
Were we where we were? Are we low in stock? And I talk to chloroquine. Why? When a governor steps up and say, I'm just going to outright ban this and not allow doctors, even if even if you're wrong, I mean, what's the harm in allowing doctors to try and allowing patients to have this medicine?
00:12:19
You know, when sometimes things happen, people. So where does a conspiracy theory? I tell people even way before President Trump said this hydroxy program was already controversial in France, actually, it used to be over the counter in France. They took it over the counter in October before the coronavirus actually hit. And then in February, they actually Mejía Skardu to drug, you know. So it's not that this is not just about America. A lot of people think this is about President Trump.
00:12:46
So this used to be over the counter in France. And when did they do this? Back in February was actually disbanded. So you had to be escorted to two drug. You need a doctor's prescription to get it. And of course, do not let the doctors do it.
00:12:59
It wasn't only me, a doctor, a renowned virologist did a lot of work. This is like a renowned virologist. He did a lot of work. So a lot of patients, they attacked him. We had Dr. Armstrong, Robin Armstrong in Texas. You know, the doctor, he took it in Texas City.
00:13:15
They had about fifty something patients in a nursing home. And he treated them with Hydroxycut, Bukidnon zero marks. And I think out of the fifty something people, just one died. So we saw all of this. This was like way back in March, April. So we were excited. So everybody was like, wow, people that, you know, those things encouraged me. But they attacked him. They vilified him. The both came after him.
00:13:36
I'm thinking to myself, this should have been become like the standard of care in every hospital in the nation, in every nursing home in the nation is of patients being sent home to die. But they vilified him. I talked to him. The boards came after Lehman, so it became really crazy.
00:13:53
So the more I spoke up on the attack, you know, he doesn't work. You should do a randomized controlled, double blinded study. I said, no, that's unethical. You don't do a randomized study when people are sick and don't do it.
00:14:03
Don't blame the families at the same time that they're saying people shouldn't be touching hydroxyl chloroquine. The same time they're saying that when the vaccine comes out, you can take it. There wasn't even a vaccine, you know, created. Yeah. And they were already pushing vaccine.
00:14:17
This is going to come and this is going to be fine. And you should be able to take this.
00:14:21
It does seem quite strange. Yes, it was strange. It is strange. It is strange. Why something crazy going on. Something sinister. Yeah.
00:14:28
And I think that, you know, the people are now asking a lot of these questions. You know, I, I did a video because I had an asthma attack and I went to an asthma clinic and the doctor had my nebulizer in the room and told me he could not give it to me because of covid-19 restrictions and got me breathing would be problematic. So he said he needed to call an ambulance, had the paramedics show up in the paramedics said we are you know, can they ask the doctor, ask, is it OK for us to give it, to give it?
00:14:59
Can you give her a nebulizer in the ambulance? Get into the ambulance. The ambulance said, we are not allowed to give you a nebulizer treatment because of covid-19 restrictions in the ambulance.
00:15:09
So, you know, when you're having an asthma attack, your lungs are closing and closing and closing.
00:15:14
And if it wasn't for just, you know, chance, I had my car there and the ambulance. Allow me to take it in there, I'm thinking how many people are dying because of that, because you're going against your Hippocratic oath and you're telling people you can't help them. They said there was one specialized room that only exists at the hospital where they are allowed to give nebulizer treatments.
00:15:33
And you know, those who said crazy, in our clinic, we give nebulizer treatments, just all my stuff. I own Hydroxycut looking for prophylaxis. I've been seeing patients. We hug them. We talk to them. We are living a free life. Right.
00:15:45
And that's and I live a fair, free life as well. And that is now considered extremely controversial. And they will demonize you if you are not living your life in fear and you see your family and you see your friends, I mean, especially me, how dare you put your baby at risk? And I'm going can much on this to six of babies that are dying of covid-19. I know. That's crazy. Right? And so this is very interesting.
00:16:05
So I want to talk about what happened to you, because the interesting thing is that you're from Cameroon, right? You come to America, you're not in politics.
00:16:16
So you don't understand what it is when you are in politics where very quickly they will try to destroy every fiber of your being if you don't say what they like.
00:16:24
And if you had remained out of politics, actually, you are the perfect. They would put you on a platform of immigrants.
00:16:30
You're a black female. You're a woman. You know what I'm saying? You're a doctor now. You've worked hard. This is like Dr. Phil Emmanuel. Here she is. We love her. But you say something. Don't realize it's political.
00:16:44
You say hydroxy chloroquine works, which puts you in line accidentally with the president of the United States. And actually, I happen to like him and all hell breaks loose.
00:16:55
We're really, really crazy. Right. And, you know, he was but as we started fighting online, we started having a meeting of our doctors. Are we fighting to like, oh, this works? Why don't you want to take care of patients? This like in March, April, and then by sometime in May, I was like, this is not a science battle. This is a propaganda battle. This is a sinister battle. And so I said, I am done being nice.
00:17:23
You know, you cannot come into a street fight with a suit. So I took off the suit and I would go after them. I would just attack them to like, oh, you want people to die here? When your doctor told me, oh, you know what? I don't believe I had doctor glugging. So tell me what you work in, what hospital you worked at. I can go back in every one of those shifts and tell you how many patients you killed.
00:17:47
Like, oh, you're being mean as I'm being mean to you. The patients you do not treat added.
00:17:52
So that is how. So I got to a stage where I was like, you know what, this cannot be happening. You know, I'm a minister of the gospel. I of know the truth, see people getting well and just keep quiet. I cannot let Americans die. So I got to that. If I perish. I cherish moment, but I got to D.C. I was if I publish or perish, I'm just not going to let Americans die.
00:18:10
I'm not going to shut the truth down and nobody's going to stop me. If they want to kill me, let them do it. I don't care. So that is where I was when I got to this.
00:18:18
To this for you was a tremendous act of bravery. It was I am ready. This is what I'm going to do the truth. And I'm doing what I tell people, what I'm what I'm seeing. And this should be OK. Yes. And it was not OK.
00:18:31
It was not OK. What? It was actually fun. It was it was fun. It was fun. So you went from being a doctor who would have been celebrated as a black woman to being called a name demon speed demon sperm doctor. What was the tag? They gave years and it started with Daily Beast, which is probably one of the loudest propagandists. Yeah, actually, I actually praised him for exposing I and she did a pretty good job really sitting down and breaking out everything I do in Deliverance Ministry.
00:19:00
And so that's what's also interesting about that is obviously The Daily Beast.
00:19:03
They are very far left, very socialist, you know, very propagandist. And what's very interesting about them, though, is that this is the same publication that routinely refers to Americans as racist, sexist, xenophobic. You know, if you if you don't believe in what they believe, what they believe in. Right. So they are all about we want to promote black woman. And if you're from Islam, this should be you know, they should they should be celebrated and then they start digging into your spiritual beliefs.
00:19:33
Suddenly, this isn't about your they're not contesting the to medical. Yes.
00:19:39
They're like, let's actually look into her her spiritual beliefs.
00:19:43
And this is timely right now because with the Amy CONI Barrett, you see, they're not asking her anything about jurisprudence, about her qualifications.
00:19:51
They're going into her Catholic beliefs. They're going into trying to make it sound like she was in a Catholic cult of some sort.
00:19:59
And this is good standing her ground, like getting her around, like you said yours.
00:20:04
My grandma said, you know what I would say that CNN basically give me millions, millions of dollars worth of advertisement, free advertising, free advertising.
00:20:13
You know, when they started breaking it on message and destroying it, I had maybe one hundred and seventy four. Five thousand views within a week, so 150000 views, people calling me from all over the world, because this is stuff that I know so well because it didn't when when I saw the video, I was assuming I was going to see something crazy.
00:20:30
It sounded like a doctor who had treated patients and was giving feedback on treating the patients. So really, the firestorm was really just that they had censored this. And you weren't the only doctor. As I said, there was there were other doctors, another doctor, I believe, in California, who came out and said what he was seeing.
00:20:45
And you, too, pulled this video down. And of course, it made him yeah. It made the video more viral, more famous, and nobody cared.
00:20:51
I mean, I wasn't curious when that doctor in L.A. and his partner were talking. I didn't say to myself, well, I wonder what he believes in spiritual. I know, right.
00:20:59
I really I wonder what he believes in, what we know, what what what scriptures he believes in, because that has nothing to do with his with his professional life.
00:21:08
But I think when it comes to my life, all things work together for my good. Mm hmm. I could have gone to D.C. and gone back home and continued being a doctor. I talked about Hydroxycut, OK, but they went and dug up my ministry. So so CNN did a great job exposing my ministry, which is actually needed with all kinds of stuff that's going on in the season.
00:21:28
So you sense you sense a spiritual battle. I talk about that. I said that in the opening chapter in my book.
00:21:32
And we are we are in a spiritual battle because people want to hear it's good versus evil.
00:21:37
And I do I 100 percent agree in your assessment that this is a good versus evil battle and that what we're seeing is pure evil. You know, as someone who's Christian, I do believe that Satan is the author of Lies and Deception. And we are seeing our media act like a propaganda arm. They are lying. They are deceiving people. They're making people fearful. And fear is the mechanism through which they are able to control control people.
00:22:00
You know, when people are fearful, they lose all sense of reasoning. You know, like I said, that moment at the Supreme Court when I spoke, I came out, I said, you know what I mean? Because you don't need to die. There's a treatment. I cannot say there's a cure anymore. I see this effective treatment because Texas board was like, if I say there's a cure, you know, we've got this going on Texas.
00:22:21
But eventually we settled that. OK, I'm going to say this effective treatment and do not to back off and leave me alone. But they are still coming off of some of the doctors.
00:22:28
So when I said this thing on that day, it Brooke, it's like fear was broken. The whole people had hope. There was a watershed moment, something, Brooke, in the spirit. That's what I said. I'd been praying and fasting for this moment.
00:22:43
Something, Brooke, that in the history of viral videos, no video ever went viral ever that fast, you know, and it was like worldwide, all the nations, the prison gate of the prison of fear that they had the nation Brooke. Mm hmm. So there is like, of course, you know, it's, you know, all this CNN on whatever they are doing. But they can't stop me because I was trained for this.
00:23:08
So what so what has happened since that moment, since that going viral, you go back to Texas and are you still seeing they are seeing more patients.
00:23:18
This is probably see to over 2000 patient.
00:23:21
No. Wow. And so this didn't hurt your career? Oh, no. I actually boosted my career. We got so busy when I got back home. It was so crazy. We're having reporters. We parked in front of my clinic and patients were calling from all over the place. People were driving for hours to come see me. Even now, we're still having so much I mean, patients leave the emergency room when they go to the emergency room and they don't want to give them people leave.
00:23:44
The medicine would lose and come to my clinic. They shouldn't do that. I'm not an emergency room, but they are coming to my clinic because they are scared of going to the hospital. Our hospitals have become a jail cell of deaf people go there. They don't give them the treatment they need. We've had patients. We've had to get their families feel Hydroxycut. You can sneak it into the hospital to them and they take it and to get will while they are trying to do it.
00:24:04
Well, just because they're saying you can only get in certain states that you can only get Hydroxycut.
00:24:08
Clarkton, if you're at the hospital which runs, actually, you can get it everywhere in certain states, they're saying, like, you can't even get it with a prescription.
00:24:16
Now, because we're talking about with Nevada, they had put in place a law where the governor said, you can't even get it from a doctor. You now can only get it if a doctor is treating you for covid-19 and decides to give it to you in the hospital. And I did a video on how crazy what was what was the point of that to getting his name.
00:24:33
I know what the point was they wanted to give her looking at a time when it was released. It wouldn't last. It wouldn't work because, I mean, from the mechanism of action works early on as prevention. What I'll tell you one thing I want to tell. You know, right now, everybody needs to get on prevention in something because it works early on in prevention. So if America right now, there is no state where is where it's it's there's no state right now.
00:24:57
It's bound technically, you know, something. So even though they just create just create barriers. Yes, we have pharmacies that will not feel it, but we do have a pharmacy. When we left when we left there, of course, we started seeing a lot of patients, outpatients coming in from all over the country. And right now we have built a network, Frontline M.D. from an M.D., from M.D. dot com, a network of. Nationwide, that would take care of patients, oh, give Hydroxycut in every single state, where is that frontline M.D. dot com.
00:25:25
Frontline M.D. dot com. Yes. Yeah, I don't think it's a bad thing to have in your medicine cabinet. Yes. So now, everybody, I think you need to have a little stash of Hydroxycut. And it's not this is enough, right? There is no shortage. India and millions and millions tiva a mile under ordinated million shortage and they're stopping it.
00:25:44
And so it's interesting, like I said, like, this seems to be something that colonists just eating bark and taking it and going in eating bark. Right. And now they're now you can't even get it behind the counter. Now, in certain states, you can't even get it.
00:25:57
I think his name is Governor Jay Inslee, who then said you can't even get it, you know, from a doctor prescription to get into the hospital.
00:26:03
And these barriers going back to me saying having the asthma attack and saying you must go to the hospital to get something that is so simple, nebulizer treatment have died, that sort of thing.
00:26:12
That's what I'm thinking. And so I think of that. And I and the question I always ask myself is, first and foremost, didn't you guys tell us the hospitals were overwhelmed?
00:26:20
Now you're sending every person to the hospital right now. You're kind you're making the hospital the conduit to every single person must go through to get any kind of treatment. What happened to the hospitals are overwhelmed, right? None of this none of this makes any sense.
00:26:34
It would. You know, let's let's let's just let's not overwhelm our hospitals. Let's flatten the curve. And then two weeks later, they just moved, but they just sort of moving it, moving it. And right now we don't even know what what we don't even know what they're saying anymore right now. Like everybody everything on the school lockdown, everybody on. I'm saying, America, we don't have to take this. Really. I've told people I said, you know, the government is not going to be able to do this for us.
00:26:57
The masses will have to our rights. We've been going around doing rallies, you know, coming around doing rallies and telling people, no, you don't have to take this. You know, the masses have to our right. I said, no, we're not going to take this. That's the only way this is going to be stopped. And, of course, the next thing we do is prayer. So when we left D.C., there are two things we put in place.
00:27:13
Number one, we put together I particularly from an empty stomach so that doctors we can get doctors that want to see patients. A lot of doctors have woken up since we came back from D.C. You know, the doctors I want to see patients can be able to see is a telehealth company. You know, somebody you can you can stay here and see somebody on the phone in California anywhere, anywhere in the country. We do have a pharmacy, too, that we ship medications to everybody, anywhere in the country since we have a lot of these big pharmacies that do not want to fill people's prescriptions.
00:27:42
So we put together the pharmacies we have and a lot of the mom and pop pharmacies, they are pretty good in taking care of patients. So there is no there is really no band right now in any state. There's really no shortage right now. Many doctors don't want to do it and many pharmacies don't want to fill it. But we do have doctors and pharmacists that will fill these prescriptions. The issue right now is that people have been so programmed, people have been so deceived that they don't think they can do it.
00:28:10
And some people just think it's dangerous. Yes, know something. So the programming has worked. So a lot of Americans are dying. That is very Netlist. People don't need to die is to pills a month, candies to pills, two pills a month. Wow.
00:28:22
Where I'm at the point, I think that there just needs to be, especially now with covid-19, a more wide ranging discussion about all medications. And we should all be able to just simply hear different perspectives. I want to be able to hear you and your thoughts, and I want to hear somebody else's thoughts and say, you know what? This person thinks she's wrong. And I want to say these are two doctors who have different opinions. Now, I can make a decision as my by myself in a free country as vegetable if I want to go with this doctor or this doctor and so free.
00:28:49
And that's the question.
00:28:50
The last time I was like, man, this feels like North Korea's right. And that's that's what I think has really been the thing that is starting to scare me is that I've never seen anything, any type of control like I have seen about the discussion surrounding covid-19, surrounding the treatment of covid-19 and surrounding the vaccine potential vaccine. Shimako, in America has never been this controlled.
00:29:14
It has never been this there's that's why I say that it's something sinister, something sinister is going on. I'm writing a book, Renner's call it America Live and Let America Live. And I'm going to be discussing even the deep spiritual things that are going on right now, because, you know, when it's no different, we think they think it's about the American election is not. I know sometimes Democrats think that, well, if this goes on, maybe it will help them.
00:29:37
They're just being opportunistic. Really. This disease doesn't care. What are you, a Democrat or Republican? It's not this about humanity, because if it's about the American election, a friend calls me from the Bahamas. They're locking them down and letting them take Hydroxycut, including what has that got to do with the American elections? They're doing it in South Africa. They are doing it in Trinidad and Tobago and you know, many other countries. What has that got to do?
00:29:58
The American elections.
00:29:59
So we need to know these things before we start taking chips that are going to change our humanity and then we cannot, you know, make it anymore doing something. We need to know these things. And I do believe that sometimes things get done in God's timing and sometimes not in God's timing. So that is why we're fighting when we left when I left DC.
00:30:17
Two things that we do, the second thing we do is we started a prayer program. We've been praying every day. We're doing deep spiritual warfare, two hours, three hours. We're praying for America, fighting for the soul of this country, fighting that things will be exposed, that deep sadness that things in the background will be exposed, because sometimes when things get this crazy, only God can help us. So we're praying. We're fighting for the nation.
00:30:39
We're building coalition. We're seeing patients. That's actually just what I've been busy doing. I know a bunch of my other colleagues are traveling all around doing interviews and getting there. But I really am just a clinician and I'm a pastor. All I want to do is take care of people. I don't want my I don't want my fellow Americans to die. I don't want people. It hurts my soul when I see people that can't breathe. That's why I say a lot of these people that are talking, they don't see patients.
00:31:02
They don't sit there and watch a diabetic come in, a 70 year old diabetic coming to your clinic, sitting and looking at you and thinking, I'm going to die. This is a death sentence. Then you hug them and tell them you're going to be OK and they are OK. We've seen over twenty patients. We've lost three patients in over twenty compared to the numbers on covid that is clinically actually insignificant. And the three patients that we lost actually refuse treatment.
00:31:26
Yes. So we had a 92 year old that we treated her. She was getting dehydrated, was a go to the hospital and get some I.V. fluids just then. I'm not going I'm going to go to the hospital. They're going to lock me up in there. I'm going to die. I want to see my family. I'm not going I'm going to stay here and take my chances with me and Jesus. That's what she said. So she refused treatment.
00:31:44
We had a 46 year old that really broke my heart that day. I actually went on to say, my heart is broken because this young man, forty six year old diabetic, had a, you know, sleep apnea, you know, and morbidly obese, was sick at Coruna. We started treating him. His oxygen was dropping. We told him, go to the hospital. He refused to go. He was burning oxygen for him. I said, go to the hospital.
00:32:08
I mean, you've been on hydroxyurea for two days. Please go to the hospital. He refused to go and he passed away because it's like, no, if I'm going to die, let me die with my family.
00:32:16
Wow. I did something that just breaks your heart that people are scared to go. Do you know how many people have not gone to the hospital or other diseases because they are scared?
00:32:25
This is this is so if we if we make it out of this and a lot tarries, they're going to look back at what happened in 2020. It's going to be very sad for humanity because the things that happen cannot even be humanly possible. Right. You know, how do doctors sit in the hospital? Patients come when you have an infection. You go to the hospital, they give you to give you antibiotics. They don't tell you go stay home to your eardrums are busted.
00:32:50
You can come back when you have a urinary tract infection. They don't know. Just go stay home till your bladder is all busted up and your kidneys are about to to pack up and you come back. We as doctors, part of our Hippocratic Oath is to alleviate pain and suffering. You don't you have something? So why would somebody come to the to the to the emergency room and breathe having this disease? Are you send them home to come back when they are sick, sick, sick, and they're being protected.
00:33:15
You know, because I asked that to my doctor because he was so scared about how low my action levels were that he called the paramedics. And I said to him, but the treatment is right here in this room and you're deciding not to give me the treatment that is right here in this room, a nebulizer right here, because the CDC, God told you that if I breathe in this room, it's you.
00:33:33
You can't have it. So you'd rather have me die and abide by CDC gods and their guidelines than to treat.
00:33:43
I just to me, I'm not a doctor, but that just would go so against every every every Steelman's, every human in state, even human instinct. Yes.
00:33:51
I saw a person I could help them. Right. And I'm like, right here. Here's here's the vial right here. I know if I give us this person, this person's dying. I couldn't imagine saying, like, you know, sorry. But unfortunately for that and I do want to defend doctors and I definitely don't mean to attack mine, they're being told they're going to have their medical license stripped.
00:34:08
You know, but that's the scary part is listen, they're being told that we already we already paid the price, you know, so we already became the fall guy. So nobody's coming after anybody's license. Doctors need to wake up. You're going to defend your license over people dying. I didn't defend my license over people dying. I chose to fight for our people. Why? What are they scared of? They didn't destroy me. Why? They're going to destroy you.
00:34:31
They didn't destroy that industry, Dr. Armstrong. They didn't destroy Dr. Zelenka. Why? They're going to destroy you. We took an oath to protect life. So all these Ezabad doctors are scared of the license. Hogwash. How many licenses are going to come after Texans? What came after me?
00:34:45
And I was like, you know what? If you come after me, it's going to be on. I'm going to fight. I'm blah, blah, blah. Yeah. And I didn't destroy me. That's right. Because, I mean, it doesn't make any sense to me. So all these things about doctors are scared. No, they're not scared. They're being murderers. Right. That's a that's a great place to end.
00:35:01
I always say, you know, there's no consequence for speaking up if what you're saying is true. And I'm I'm a big believer in that. And, you know, the consequences you can deal with people mean tweets, calling you names, calling you demon doctor, you know, calling me white supremacy. I can deal with. I can. I'm calling, you know, because to me, the bigger threat is allowing the lie to continue. So I want to commend you for that video for coming out and saying what you were seeing, which was just simply the truth and wish you luck.
00:35:31
And we wrap every episode by allowing you to leave a two minute face message for the world. So you're going to look at that camera and you're going to say whatever you want, whatever is on your heart and whatever, even though you have been viral before, what you wish every person could hear in this country at this time, are you ready on your mark?
00:35:47
Get set world.
00:35:48
I give you Dr. Stella Emmanual right now, everybody. All I would say is get prophylaxis. Good prophylaxis prevention is better than good. There's no reason for you to quit. And if you get sick early treatment, get early treatment. Don't wait until you cannot breathe. We can stop this pandemic in its tracks and pray for the nation because this is stronger than all of us can handle. And we need God to help us. Thank you.
00:36:15
