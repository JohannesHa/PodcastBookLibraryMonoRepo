00:00:07
All right, all right. I would do a soft open and then I'm going to cut to you and juice you and we'll get right into it. You can say whatever you want. Cool. I talk improvs this thing anyway.
00:00:17
Exactly right. All right. Ready? OK, ladies and gentlemen, we are rolling into another episode of The Kandace Owens Show.
00:00:26
Many of you who follow me know that I was definitely probably the first person who spoke out against the Metoo movement in the Metoo movement, started trending on Twitter.
00:00:37
Both the left and the right thought that this was a protected space in a conversation, a platform for women to come out and speak about sexual assault in the past. Now, I immediately spoke out against it, not because I think it's a good thing women are sexually assaulted, not because I think it's a good thing if women are raised, but because I also think it is a bad thing if men are accused of crimes and forced to deal with the penalties of those crimes without due process.
00:01:06
What I saw really trending on Twitter was a bunch of women saying things happened and these women being applauded and men being castigated without any further exploration into the allegations against them. Now, of course, even though left and right agreed with this when it was trending, we saw the right break away from this.
00:01:23
Conservatives realizing that it was, in fact, problematic when we got to the trial of Brett Kavanaugh, a 30 plus year old allegation, zero proof.
00:01:35
And yet this man was virtually hung in front of the world. For me as a black American, it was reminiscent of the things that I learned about the civil rights era when white women could make allegations and simply be believed on the basis of their word. My ancestors got hung. Here, discuss this and more with me, I have comedian Brian Cowan. Yes, welcome to the Cornerstone Channel. Thank you. I'm a fan.
00:02:00
Thanks for joining. I'm happy to be here.
00:02:03
I'm always happy to have comedians on here because one of the spaces that's definitely under attack is just being able to tell a joke, right? Yeah. And this used to be we needed comedians in the world because comedians actually bring us all closer together. We make them make fun of everyone. And then you kind of realize, all right. All right. It's it's actually funny. We all kind of suck a little bit. You know, we all have our good things and bad things.
00:02:25
And now we're suddenly in an era where comedians are digging up tweets from 20 years ago, he said this word and now he needs to be canceled.
00:02:32
Yeah, well, art's always I think good art has always been something that disturbs, you know, especially satire. Satire was always something that rulers were terrified of cartoonists. And, you know, I mean, I think there's a lot of power in being able to point out the contradictions in human behavior. And all of us are a walking contradiction to an extent. So, you know, Bellbird went crazy on Saturday Night Live and you and there were plenty of people saying, you know, my whole family walked out when we heard this.
00:03:05
It good. It's all good. That's the American way. You have a right to walk out. You have a right to be disturbed. You have a right to say to boo. But for the most part, what's great about being allowed to just speak your mind? It's called original self-expression. And if you feel like you're going to get in trouble, if you feel like your livelihood is going to be affected by speaking your mind, by who you're making fun of, I think we're all in trouble because stand up is still the law, I really believe.
00:03:34
Stand up as of last bastion of free speech. I totally agree with you. Yeah. So so it's incredibly important. We need more of that because it just gets people to think. By the way, it also it also gets you to kind of lower your guard when I when a comedian makes fun of my positions, my political positions, my philosophical positions, just who I am as a person, I listen. I listen. If it's if it's really good, sometimes it's just too undeniable.
00:03:58
And you kind of go, I mean, I never thought about that when it comes to myself.
00:04:02
And it's important to be able to laugh at yourself. And I think that that is the magic. When you look at all. I mean, I can't imagine George Carlin being able to survive in the society that we have today. God, which just preaches so much political correctness when people like him are just the exact antithesis of political correctness.
00:04:18
But that's because every time, even when you use the word political correctness, my feeling is that people that being offended isn't an argument, it just isn't. And as soon as I see people who are professionally outraged, generally outraged and, you know, get a get to Twitter and start to freak out, my suspicion is that they just don't have an effective argument to mount against what they intuitively feel is offensive, because most of the time we're defending, not really our defending, not so much ourselves, even not even a philosophy.
00:04:58
We're defending the people we love, who we grew up with, who indoctrinated us into a certain philosophy. These are just ideas, man. Whenever I hear someone talking about power and everything is power and you hear these academics talking about that, the world is just about it's just power structures. And I'm tyrannical because obviously I'm a straight white male and I'm at the top of the pyramid and I've got all this honor and privilege.
00:05:22
I understand. But as soon as I hear those, when you're when you're putting the world into these neat little boxes, well, I know where you are. I know who you read. I know I can just see the Austrian school of economics. I can see Minkus. I can see all the people that you've read. And those are just ideas that were put into your brain and you've held on to why not so much? Because they make sense, but because they make you feel safe.
00:05:47
They make you feel significant and they make you feel virtuous. Right.
00:05:51
And people don't like having their safe spaces challenge because it can take away from yourself virtue.
00:05:57
That's right. Which is why you should go to stand up comedy and we can take a hammer and break that little egg that you've been living in. And you might evolve a little bit as a person, whether you're on the right or on the left. Don't don't be so attached to your ideas.
00:06:11
Right. And it's funny that you say that because, of course, Dave Chappelle came after me in a stand up. He did skit. He did. He did.
00:06:17
Well, congratulations, by the way, though, because you're just like us.
00:06:21
And to be honest, to be honest with you, when I saw it, I didn't actually think the content of what he said was funny. He just was like he sort of wanted to assault me in my lady parts.
00:06:30
But as I was trending on Twitter about this and, you know, everyone's coming after me waiting for me to be upset.
00:06:37
And the first thing I said was, you know, this is Dave Chappelle. He is saying, my name on stage is one of the greatest comedians that's ever lived. A it's a compliment, right? To me. Yes.
00:06:47
And B, I've spent my entire career defending the right for people to say what they want. I, of course, am not going to attack him for saying what he wants. I really do believe we need more of this. I'm happy to be offended if we're all ready to be offended and it just completely shut up the entire they just didn't know what to do with it because it was sort of this moment where they needed me to be offended. And instead I chose to say like that we need more of that.
00:07:11
Well, good for you. Yeah, that's exactly right. Maybe he got you to think a little bit. It's not as though Canciones has arrived at the truth. You're working your way through it, too. You're asking questions. Do you still read? Are you still open to conversation? Are you still having your mind changed? My guess is probably yes. Right.
00:07:28
And the thing is, is what we were disagreeing on was the George Foy thing. And by the way, I got done with this skit and I still stand by everything I said about George Bush, in fact, more because then post his skit is when the full tape was released. And I felt even more audacious in my beliefs and I knew that I was taking an angle. I tend to upset a lot of people because I don't go with the crowd on perspectives of certain things.
00:07:50
But he's a comedian, you know. What are you expecting from him? Like, what am I supposed to say? Turn off the TV? This is abhorrent that he would say this. And as a feminist, you know, people need to stand up and defend me.
00:08:02
Look, you might be offending a lot of people. You're also emboldening a lot of people. You also make a lot you also give a lot of people faith because you have guts. You everybody I know in my family, they they when they found out I was doing the show, they're so excited. And I was to because I think you have a great deal of courage. You know, you speak your mind. I love watching you on these clips when you're in Congress and things like that, because you're so clear, you're so articulate and you have a point of view, a strong one, and you speak your mind.
00:08:34
That's that may be disturbing. Thank God. Thank God we have dissenting opinion. Right, because that's very important. That's kind of the point of having Republicans and Democrats. That's that's almost what the framers wanted, which was government to move slowly. So we had these debates. Do you think there weren't arguments when we were when they were drafting the Constitution? Do you think there weren't arguments on the drafting the Bill of Rights? You don't think the people had a point of view and they were fighting it out and they came to a compromise.
00:09:03
It's called idea sex, right? It's what it's what I talk about it. It's what I talk about in my special. That's that's the idea. I have an idea. You have an idea. They may not be. There's some truth in your idea. Some have some useful parts of that idea. And the same with yours. But we don't have we haven't figured out the whole thing. Maybe we put our ideas together and somebody gets pregnant.
00:09:23
Do you think I mean, no pun intended.
00:09:28
Do you think comedians are losing their spine a little bit?
00:09:32
They're afraid they are. I'll tell you why. Mhm. Unfortunately I think everybody's really afraid. I've seen this with my own eyes. I've had very powerful people call me and tell me this because the truth is it's very easy to destroy someone's life and take everything away from them. Everything they've worked for happened to me and it's happened to a lot of people I know. And it doesn't take any proof. It takes an allegation. It takes a tweet.
00:10:05
And, you know, people think when you get fired for a tweet you sent out ten years ago, fifteen years ago, and you were joking around, there is no redemption online. And it's it's it's when you have a mortgage and you have children to pay for, you're going to choose that course.
00:10:25
You're going to choose to protect your ability to keep that roof over your head, your car payments and your children in school over an ideology. So what happens is we are living in this time. We are not allowed to speak your mind. You're not allowed to get closer to the truth. You better be on one side or you better be very quiet. And now you can't even be quiet. Now, with this notion of critical race theory and stuff, even silence is violence, right?
00:10:51
It's just what's going on. There are some very bad ideas out there and they're not the ideas that gave us the free society that we have. The only way we move forward is through debate, through the exercise of free ideas and let's see whose ideas best. And that's that's what's under attack. Yeah.
00:11:10
And you know, what's really interesting is I was sort of thinking about when did this all start? Because obviously this whole push towards political correctness didn't begin. When I became conscious to it, it began long before it. And I was giving a speech of the night and I was talking about even English words that had real meaning.
00:11:26
Right. We've allowed people to take those words, twist the meaning, and then say that we're not allowed to use those words anymore. And I'll give you a perfect example. I'm reading a really old book right now called The Smallest. It's from pre World War One. And the word faggot is in the book as it is meant to be a bundle of sticks.
00:11:44
Right. That's what you got at some point in society. You know, the word faggot, a bundle of sticks got taken and got. A sign of something it never meant and now we're no longer allowed to say that word and it gets censored everywhere, which is interesting, right? But what about if it's used in its true context?
00:11:58
And I'm reading this book and thinking that similarly for that always bothered me because I read old books. Retarded is a real word when something is delayed, right.
00:12:07
When something is you know, if you said something and I say that was retarded, it was you fired off a response late.
00:12:13
But now at some point it began to mean that you were always referring to somebody that was mentally incapacitated. But this word was a real English word that had a meeting.
00:12:23
Yeah, I think, though, sometimes things get worse maybe.
00:12:27
Well, I think there's a larger thing that I think sometimes those words are are hurtful to us, to an inflexible minority, because they've really paid a price for that. Right. So I'm old enough to remember when being gay was physically dangerous. It just was. Man And you and people heard that word as they were as they were being booted into the ground. And so when you have a group of people who gay people remember, it was it was really I think it was 1993 when when the the notion of homosexuality was no longer considered a a mental disorder.
00:13:01
Right. I mean, so this is very recent.
00:13:03
So if you're if you're using the word not as it's meant, but I'm just that makes sense.
00:13:08
I just think that with with the AIDS epidemic and with with the amount of violence that gay people did experience, I just I'm old enough to remember this is dangerous. And it was also when you said you were gay, if you were in a job in corporate America, you got fired or you got me.
00:13:23
It just I remember it being a real what I'm saying is that what about the word in its actual context, different? We take down a train. Different story. Do you get what I'm saying? So I just I have been sort of thinking about this recently, the actual disappearance of words in their true context. I'm not talking about when you see a gay man and you use that word. Right, right. I'm talking about these words now have to be stripped because these words have been taken and violence has been assigned to them.
00:13:46
These words not being shipped out of out of just English vocabulary, which is something that I think is fascinating.
00:13:51
The English language changing the language is always changing. But words do have meaning. Right. And now and why I find this to be dangerous and I agree with you when it's used in a harmful way. You're talking about homosexual men.
00:14:03
It's wrong. But why I find this to be dangerous is now because we're seeing on the left a game where they're taking words that aren't even being used when when you're assaulting a homosexual or is that you're just actually saying and they're assigning meaning to it, that has never existed. You didn't mean it in that way. And they're trying to use it under the same bubble of thought that you just used when you defend the disappearance of a bundle of sticks. Right.
00:14:26
It's about it's about power and control. It's interesting. Yeah. It's about getting rid of your enemies. Right.
00:14:31
That people you disagree with these very effective ways to get rid of the people who disagree with the people you think are keeping, I suppose, a systematically racist, whatever it might be, society in place. You can do it with finding out what they said and mounting, you know, enough of an opposition online where the or suddenly the citizens don't want to deal with it.
00:14:54
You can't say, for example, all lives matter because you get fired. Right. So now you'll get fired saying all these matters.
00:14:59
So we both agree that what used to mean a bundle of sex got used during the eighties during a horrific time and gay people lived through a horrible thing in this word went away. Right now they're trying to liken that to saying all lives matter and they're firing people, getting rid of people for using the expression all lives matter.
00:15:16
These are three English words. Yeah. Nobody who's saying all lives matter means I hope black people die and suffer at the hands of police officers. But they're now taking that. And this is what this is the slippery slope of allowing words to have actual meaning to be taken and by the political correctness guides and interpreted to something that you don't actually mean.
00:15:38
I read a book recently by Nassim Nicholas called Skin in the Game. It's a great book. I recommend it highly. And he is a guy who who kind of had a very interesting theory about why these narratives are being taken over and enforced on the rest of us. And one of it is that there are we have experienced a takeover by people who have no skin in the game, that people who can make decisions for the rest of us and not pay a price for when they are wrong.
00:16:10
Think about journalists who opine and predict. They can say whatever they want. They can they can. They think about academics who come up with these these marginalises theories that have not been tested. I mean, whether it's white privilege or whatever, it might be. Critical race theory that goes back to these are these are narratives that used to be on the fringes of academia. But you have you have especially in the social sciences, you've got these academics that have been able to purify their echo chamber.
00:16:41
They just have there isn't enough opposition. There isn't any idea what's going on. I interviewed my I used to have a podcast. I interviewed probably five hundred academics, smart people. The orthodoxy and the terror they had of stepping outside of of of of what what was expected of their speech was palpable. It was incredible. And the vast majority of them, if not if they weren't Marxists, they were at least socialists.
00:17:07
And the great God, the great word for them was, was equality, equality. But here's the problem. Here's the problem. How do you learn anything? You can learn things by listening, by observing and by reading. But there are some things you can only learn by doing. Think about fighting. You can be caged side and call fights for one hundred years. You can predict fights. You can never fight a game. That never means you can take what you know here and put it in your body and get in and slip punches and hit.
00:17:36
Right. You can I could I could teach you all you wanted about stand up comedy. The only way to be good at standup comedy is by being really bad for a long time. You have to learn through the pain of adjustment, the way you catch a ball. You can't read how to catch a ball the way you do surgery. Can you imagine? Can you imagine? You were about to go under the knife and the surgeon goes, I've read about this.
00:17:56
I've I've watched a bunch of tape. You're my first patient. Oxygen. Yeah. You know, you freak out. So there are people, though, who are in power, whether they're foreign policy experts talking about regime change, whether they're academics pushing these narratives on our schools, whether they are politicians who don't pay a price, economic economists who haven't. We've never made a business work, who live in a world of theory.
00:18:20
They've never had to learn something at the pain of adjustment. They've actually never had to do something. They've been living in a world of theory. They have a lot of power. They're very articulate, and somehow they've got no position where they can push narratives on the rest of us. This is all this is all from the book, but it made so much sense. Yeah. And when they're wrong, we spent six trillion dollars and counting on these Middle East wars, six trillion since 2011.
00:18:46
Who's signing those checks? What am I getting for my money? Six trillion. One trillion is six is a thousand billion. The average person is alive for about two and a half billion seconds. If you're lucky. I'm just giving you an idea of how much six thousand billion is. That's how much money we've spent and counting.
00:19:01
I want to know who is who's accountable and what am I getting for that money. Unfortunately, we're living in a time where I don't think our government represents us and most of us feel powerless, most of us feel as though we don't have an ability to make a difference unless you're someone like can and someone's by the way and I'm not kidding, because all of a sudden, one of the great things about social media, there's a lot of trappings, but one of the great things about social media is at least there are people like you who get up there and start telling the truth.
00:19:28
Guess what?
00:19:28
A lot of people agree with you and a lot of people listen to how interesting, even though Twitter, I'm sure, goes crazy on you, most people are like she's got a point or.
00:19:39
Yeah. And that's why I speak out, because I'm realizing more and more what we're seeing exactly what you're talking about, particularly, I think the academia with this push for political correctness and the perversion of actual American phrases and American words, they can make anything.
00:19:53
I mean, they are now saying the Pledge of Allegiance, the USA chant, is racist, but you know what I'm saying? Like, so so these things were OK. Now they're not OK.
00:20:04
How many words are we going to be left with that are OK for us to say when they can look into some deeper meaning they're making and see and see some oppression? But this is a major overreach.
00:20:15
And here's why. Human beings, a lot of us, there are certain things, tradition and the sanctity they're in are important. They're important parts of our moral right. They're important parts of our value system.
00:20:30
And when you just start tearing down statues or you just start getting rid of the Pledge of Allegiance just willy nilly, because you might have decided it creates a visceral reaction.
00:20:38
God, merry Christmas. I mean, it's actually what we're seeing right now is an attack on the English language. And I try to understand and I know that I'm awake to it now, but like, when exactly did it start? Or maybe it started with something that was genuine, like people realizing that words were being perverted and used to harm people. And we would never want that. Like, of course, when if you're saying something is delayed or retarded, I would never mean to talk about somebody who has mental disabilities.
00:21:04
Right. So there's us trying to do the right thing because we are good people. And we want to say if this actually offends people, I don't want to say it right. But then some powerful people realized, hey, there's power in that. If we can say it offends people, then we can, you know, write, gain a lot of power and say that all of these words are suddenly not OK. And that's where we're at right now in society.
00:21:24
This this push and pull ups of us want to do the right thing. But also now realizing that doesn't matter what we say, because no matter what we say, we're in trouble and you're in hot water. And this is the space that I see comedians.
00:21:35
Well, because because because again, and to your point, most of us are living our lives. I got it. I got bills. So I work in a restaurant. I'm not trying to run a restaurant. I'm not thinking about race. I'm really not. I need to get good food to my customers and compete with the restaurant over there. Whatever that takes, I got to do the last thing I'm thinking about is how racist we are. I don't have most people just don't have the time.
00:21:57
The people that are coming up with these narratives have the time to sit around and think about it. I agree. They're not actually doing the work. They're not they don't have I'm sorry, but they don't have real jobs. But one of the things I thought was great about this book, Skin in the Game, is he says, I wonder how many Hollywood celebrities and how many academics and how many economist, how many politicians preaching economic and social equality actually have friends that work with their hands.
00:22:19
How many people are at your table? At your dinner table you invite who are landscapers and plumbers and carpenters?
00:22:25
Just a question. Just a question. And, you know, even Sam Harris admitted and I love that he said, I don't know any, but I don't think anybody my phone I know who actually even smoked cigarettes.
00:22:35
That's a class of people. Yeah. You know, it's very easy to surround yourself with the people. The same people that have read the same books, listen to the same TED talks and speak the same language. I think it's very important we can change things about one of the beautiful things. Yes, of course.
00:22:49
But intelligence, a component of intelligence is experience.
00:22:53
It's right. It's and it's doing there's certain things, you know, as a car mechanic, as a farmer that I will never know. You know, it's one of the beautiful things about being a stand up comic and traveling. Touring is I'm around real people are performing for working people who work, who have to pay a babysitter, who deal with who are dealing with those those essentials where the full time job for them is keeping a roof over their head, car payments.
00:23:19
And once in a while they get to go out and see a standup comedian. That's a big deal.
00:23:24
That's when your feet are on the ground, man. You're a grounded person.
00:23:28
And I think that that is because of my upbringing. I'm so grateful for it. And I always say that when I was young, I hated being poor. Oh, my goodness. If I told you the amount of times, God, why me? God, you know, feeling like God had betrayed me and turned back on me because I just had this horrible circumstance my whole life. And now I'm where I'm at and I go, thank goodness, thank God that I had to live through struggle, that my parents didn't have anything, that I had to fight, you know, my way out of debt to live a life, you know.
00:23:54
Yeah. And I slept on those couches and slept in my car and did all those things because it does attach me to a reality.
00:24:00
And I will say this on both sides of the political aisle, that that you can see people just completely detached from it completely. And it's it's lived experience that we're talking about, that's where you get your courage. I think I can see that in you. Yeah, because I always say what a sign of remarkable privilege that, like, my granddad had to deal with segregation. And I don't mean tweets like, you know what I mean?
00:24:20
Like, that's a good perspective to have. People are like, how do you do it this fall on? Like, I am privileged.
00:24:24
You know, you said something to a bunch of them. They were protesting something. You were talking. And I remember I was on YouTube and you said, you guys, it was these bunch of these sort of war college kids. And most of them, I think, were white. And you said you guys are more emotional than the people who went through it, went through it. Right.
00:24:40
You guys are. You know that UCLA. I remember saying that I couldn't believe looking. If you talk to black Americans today, they are so oppressed. And I'm talking about, you know, not every black American, but as a rule, because this Black Lives Matter narrative and you talk to especially in college campuses where they have this sort of Marxist indoctrination and they genuinely are speaking like they're living in 1889 America and their privilege here. They are sitting in UCLA.
00:25:04
You know, and I just look at you and I just go, what an insult to your ancestors. And because my grandfather still breathing, I'm just I'm just thinking my head all the time. Whenever I think I can get upset, I'm trending on Twitter or something. I didn't say I'm like white privilege, you know what I mean? This is the worst part of my life. Looking at my phone and seeing Candice Owens, I have to read a fake article about my grandfather in a fake article, fake article about me and people.
00:25:28
When people I think it's important that we always have that perspective. And I always call a call upon people to whatever you think, whatever you think.
00:25:35
You're having a bad day, take it two generations ago in your family.
00:25:38
Yeah. And I think I think in a lot of ways I'm an optimist and I think that. Free speech may be under attack, but it's also having its day look, nobody is nobody's going to stop you from not only not only speaking your mind, but profiting from it. The fact that you're so popular means that people really appreciate at least your pushback. I love that debate between you and Tie and Killer Mike and all those other people. One of my favorite things to do is to watch lately debates between black conservatives and black liberals.
00:26:12
I just like I love because this idea, because what we do is we do this monolith. So you have the well, the black vote or the or the Asian vote. What are you talking about? And you say that about white people.
00:26:21
Are you saying black people agree with each other? Are you saying that there's so much diversity of opinion in that community, like in every community? And so whenever I hear that, I go, oh, you don't spend any time around people like that. You don't have any real friends who are hanging out in that in that in that community. So what are you talking about? Because that's that's where the condescension comes in and an accidental condescension.
00:26:45
Actually, the other day someone had tweeted to me, I don't understand why Kansas doesn't work with blah, blah, blah, a black conservative who believes in this and that.
00:26:54
And I just said, would you ever say that to a white conservative? Like just because a person is a black conservative, you think that we naturally all need to be working together? You know, understand that even black conservatives, we have various points, you know, various goals where we're different people. Yes. And we've just gone to just think of everybody in terms of these little boxes. And it is it's suffocating being a black person because they have just this idea of what you're supposed to think, how you're supposed to feel, who you're supposed to even work with, even if they agree with you.
00:27:20
When you say that it's actually a lot of times it's white people. Yes. I mean, it's very it's very true.
00:27:29
I really want to talk to you about because you unbelievably are probably the closest person I'm going to get to be able to speak to, something reminiscent at least of the Brett Kavanaugh situation, where you as a comedian had an allegation from twenty one years ago. And this happened. This is happening in the present right now. Yes, it was 21 years ago. And a young woman says something happened 21 years ago. My young son now was young, I guess 21 years ago, and then now made an allegation against you and wham, you got canceled.
00:28:04
Yes. Everything goes away. Everything goes away overnight. An allegation. Everything was it proved, was there? No, no.
00:28:13
And the problem is that whenever something like that happens and it's 21 years old, the only thing you can do really is go. No, I didn't. What else are you going to do? No, I didn't. And what's interesting is that most people say, you know, you just got the only way to fight this. Sometimes, they say, is to just disappear. No, no, I won't. I won't. I know who I am.
00:28:39
The people that know me know who I am. And so sometimes you define yourself along the lines of what you would. You define yourself based on what you're willing to fight for and by the way, die for sometimes on that hill. You know, I'm sorry to be dramatic, but that's who are you in moments of chaos. And and unfortunately, sometimes you just there's nothing you can do.
00:29:00
So I have a question.
00:29:01
If somebody and I'm just trying to figure this out or somebody who works with a bunch of other companies. But if somebody made an allegation against me, you know, I'm 31, 20 years ago would be weird.
00:29:10
It's just when she was 11 years old, she was a child. The precocious, outrageous child, I tell you.
00:29:19
But let's say they did this allegation against me and I get something. And it's 21 years ago. And suddenly, Prager, you just next day, they hear the allegation like have you're done? What is the retribution against companies with I mean, it isn't due process like a part of the American system. Like, is there any retribution when you get what do you get dropped by sponsors dropped by your show based on allegations? I've seen this happen forgetting forget the meta sexual assaults up.
00:29:43
I've seen this happen. Somebody says she was mean to me and she's a racist. And I've seen people lose all their sponsorships. Sponsorships are that's a toxic work.
00:29:51
They created a toxic work environment with. No, even though it's the set of Ellen, you work in a real toxic environment, please, like a crab boat or in a coal mine or in a chemical factory or a slaughterhouse. Would you I mean, get a little perspective? I'm sure it wasn't that great. I'm sure that there was. But my God, have we lost perspective? Lost the plot? Yeah, but yeah. Yes.
00:30:11
The truth is, what happens with all your sponsors and what happens with anybody who pays your bills is it's it's just too risky.
00:30:21
And they just do this. They go, we know we believe we're with you, but unfortunately, we just you know, there are other we can do it. We can just pivot over here.
00:30:32
We just have to for now what happened. And it's so sad. There's nothing you can say.
00:30:36
You understand it because because social media is loud and even it again, it's an inflexible minority.
00:30:42
Well, I have to say credit to Brager U.B.. They have gone through about 20 kandice scandals that things that never happened and they've always held me down. They feel like this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Like, I mean, you're important as they say it takes, but because you has a spine, you know what I mean? They have a spine and they're not going to sit here and let the Twitter verse dictate who they work with.
00:31:01
Something crazy. This is a white supremacist is threatening.
00:31:04
How weird if like Dennis Prager was like everything he can. We know you're not really a white person. You've got to let you go because this is just not good right now, you know?
00:31:12
Well, some people are kind of untouchable. Right. And I feel that way about you. Yeah, because I'm black. Yeah. Although you still get your share of criticism, although you still lambasted for being what you're not. But it's because they don't have they don't have an effective argument, doesn't land the same when they're doing it against a black woman.
00:31:28
But you're not a black woman. No.
00:31:30
Or do you identify and I still didn't mean to you know, do I do identify as a black woman? But I'm not one. Not one. You're not yourself, by the way. Yeah, no, I'm confused.
00:31:38
Yeah. I mean, I'm in transition. Right. So you have that going on.
00:31:44
There's not one that's not a good impression of a black woman. My fingers up like that.
00:31:48
I like the latest. Yes. My true colors. Exactly. But because you're a white man sort of this allegation, they so they just sort of say, OK, bye. I'm sorry. We know, we know. But we have to go sort of a thing.
00:32:02
Yeah. Yeah. I knew right away there's nothing you can do about it. There's nothing you can do.
00:32:08
This just isn't. And I think there's the only thing you can kind of do is keep moving forward, try to try to pivot, try to come up with a you just have to just keep creating and thinking and do do what you did to get yourself to the dance. And I think Jordan Peterson said the only way out of chaos is to tell the truth. Yeah. And I love that. So align yourself with the truth. You know, people know who I am, right.
00:32:38
And the people I care about now, I am right. And oh, by the way, so do so. Any of the women in my life, in my past, you know, I without going into detail that that was sort of made clear to me, too. I said I said to my lawyer and my publicist, I said, I need to know that you believe me, I'm not interested in the hired gun. I want you to know.
00:33:00
And then I showed them my sort of evidence. And and that was that was very important to me. Right. You know, I don't want I don't want to be somebody who hires someone who is defending me because I'm paying them because I'm on their team. I'm not interested in that. Right. I'm just not so. But again, sometimes your chaos comes in a form you have no defense for. Right.
00:33:26
And I agree with that to me. I think when I first started speaking out against me to movement and like I said, was lambasted by both sides, it was just about the truth and saying that there has to be due process. You cannot throw up something on Twitter as an allegation and somebody should just be able to have their entire lives raised. And I think I've held firm on that because I have defended men on the right and then on the left, you know, and I'm just asking a question or saying I don't you know, I don't believe this or I'd like to see more information.
00:33:53
I could not stand Matt Lauer at all.
00:33:57
I thought he was a horrible human being. There's no doubt to me that he was, you know, all powerful and omnipotent when he was on air. But I did.
00:34:04
I struggled to believe that he raped a woman, an intern or a producer, whatever it was that worked for him. And then after rape, that was that the allegation? It well, yeah, it was rape. She came out and said rape. And then after the rape, she proceeded to have a consensual affair with him for two months that he took back to his apartment and all these different places. And I said, OK, well, listen, I'm not pretending to understand the psychology of rape victims, but I find this a bit problematic to believe as somebody who's worked, you know, in the business, I understand women who want to climb a lot to be like powerful men.
00:34:36
There's a dynamic between that. And I just wasn't I didn't want to leave this at face value. And I and I spoke out, you know, and said this is a little bit ridiculous. He had I mean, I have to imagine it wouldn't have been difficult for him to find a woman who wanted to sleep with him. And then the whole idea of, you know, I was raped but then decided to love my rapist and have an affair.
00:34:56
There should have just been more question marks in the condemnation, is all I'm saying.
00:35:00
Well, a little bit of due process, but didn't matter.
00:35:02
Yeah, I think that I think there are a couple of thoughts that I have on that. One is that when something when an allegation is weaponized, I don't think it serves the movement itself. I think what it does, it creates a reign of terror. And, you know, everyone, including people who are whoever they might be, who are staunch mutu advocates and stuff, have brothers and have sons and have husbands. And I think that the that's the that's the larger I actually think overall and I've thought about it a lot.
00:35:33
I think the and I've seen it have a positive effect in Hollywood. The meta movement is is positive in many ways because and I'm saying this is an actor who is in the business for a long time. Women had to deal with powerful men in the business and a lot of them behaved well and a lot of them didn't, and a lot of them didn't even have to think about their impact, about the fact that they were putting pressure on. I know a woman who I who interviewed she's a good friend of mine, interviewed at a large, you know, corporation before.
00:36:09
Me, too. She very attractive. And the guy the interview went really well. And the guy asked her out and she knew if she said, no, she's not getting the job. So I like the idea of women having a whisper network. I like the idea of women for the first time having recourse because it does put men who are problematic on notice. And there are a lot of men in power who are problematic. It's just a fact, right?
00:36:37
You have a lot of assholes who do what they want. And if there's no consequence, you know, that power, that that sort of feeling of impunity will grow. And you have people who don't care about your feelings and who will do what they want and will take what they want. We know that. And I think so in that sense. I like I'm I'm a I'm a fan of fair play.
00:36:59
That's why you want to call me a feminist. Whatever. I just like the idea that if you're good for the job, I don't care what you look like and I don't care what your sexuality is. If you're good for the job and you're going to you're good for my bottom line. I'm hiring you, which is why I love commerce and I'm a free market capitalist. I just love it, you know. But but for the most part, that's that's where it's good.
00:37:21
Where it like any revolution, it will eat its young if you're not careful and if you don't have a way to navigate it's abuse. When the pendulum swings all the way to the side, you will have bodies on the side of the road. And the problem with that is you might say, well, you got to some people get burned by the Senate revolution. It's all good. And it's what you've got to crack a couple of eggs to make an omelet.
00:37:43
OK, here's the problem with that. Your next and if you're not next, someone you love is there needs to be nuance.
00:37:49
You'll have to be nice. It seems to me it's the pendulum's either all the way here are the Punjab's all the way. That's what I'm saying is, hey, a little bit of due process, a little bit of thinking, a little bit of honesty. And I think that my trouble with the Metoo movement is that it just it lacked honesty. And I feel the same way about by the way, when I talk about black America, I went on that exact same site where I say we're no longer being honest when we can't talk about the fact that it isn't that difficult to listen to police instructions.
00:38:15
Right, right. Let's just start there. You say that people's heads explode.
00:38:19
Some people. Yeah, I bet you most people agree with you, including black, white, maybe quietly.
00:38:22
But I'm saying this was sort of the whole big. Who the heck is this girl saying that we need to be responsible and follow police instructions like these things should be like common sense, right. It doesn't need to be totally like police should be able to do whatever they want, doesn't need to be black. People should be able to do everything on the employed by the police. But this is sort of what we're doing. And I'm sort of like, hey, so what if you weren't a jerk and you listen to instructions when you got pulled over, we might be able to get something done.
00:38:47
And I find the exact same thing with the feminist movement. Right. So it's like we don't want omnipotent men telling, you know, making women feel inferior. But at the same time, we don't want women saying I had, you know, a three month affair. Nothing is my fault. I'll cut me a six million dollar check. So there's there's something here you're selling.
00:39:03
You're sounding very reasonable and balanced, which is why they hate me. Well, that's not very American. Americans have a lot of trouble being two things at once. They just do. Americans are very interesting. That way you can't be pro black lives matter, just like the idea that you don't want black people to be brutalized. And there is a history of that. There's a different experience for black Americans historically with the police for sure than guys like me.
00:39:26
Fact. I've never thought about it. What cops pull me over. I'm like, what's up, bro? Yeah, you look like me, you know? You know, I feel protected. Not so with my black friend. I've just had too many conversations for me, though.
00:39:36
As a black woman, I. Black men. Yeah. Yes, different. What I'm saying is that there is there is you are allowed to be pro police and pro law and order and pro police behavior, you know, with accountability and properly I'm allowed to do both.
00:39:50
But, you know, it's funny with America, it's got to be a dichotomy at all times. And like, why is it a dichotomy?
00:39:55
We do this with nutrition. Look, what happens in nutrition is a religion, right? So all of a sudden, they come out with a study that omega three fatty acids are good for your heart and good for everything else.
00:40:03
Well, now we've got to put it in bread and everything else. An entire industry is small and and people are you know, you're either a vegan or you're a carnivore.
00:40:12
We just like, you know, skinny, skinny, skinny models. They're anorexic. And now we've got clinical obesity on full display.
00:40:19
It's like maybe something in the middle. I don't know, like maybe I don't want to see it clinically about person. I also don't want to see it anorexia go in with her report that maybe actually both are unhealthy, like, so I'm here in the middle and it's just not fun because people hate people hate when someone just says, hey, maybe a little both of this is at fault and there's something in the middle that we could carve out.
00:40:39
Yeah. That would make a little more sense.
00:40:41
We need you American society. We need you to. I say everything I think on in the program. All right, I mean, they just let me do this. Well, you're undeniable. You're on cancelable. Well, your husband has that fantastic. There's always there's always that sort of wonderful. He always sounds correct because it sounds like an aristocrat.
00:41:00
I've always said something fantastic about having that kind of lovely, you know, blonde hair is tall and these so I want to I want to be an aristocrat. I want to have an accent.
00:41:11
I always wonder, like, what contemporary. And that's it's his little English accent.
00:41:15
And I'm like, oh, he's got a good rob a bank with that accent. He could walk in and go, I'm sorry, I don't have a gun, but give me all your money, please.
00:41:22
Please put the money in the bag, put all the money.
00:41:27
I can hear him talk all day. I know.
00:41:29
I know. I got to do another episode with him. Have you done so with him? I have. I've done one. I'm not going to every every every every woman was like, oh, I get why she's married to this guy. And come on, I never said anything profound. I think he just was like, hey, well, I didn't know he was your husband.
00:41:41
He walked in and he was very quiet and standing there. And I was like, what's with the blond hair and the accent? I feel bad about myself.
00:41:49
I mean, that's yeah, that's that's exactly what I don't want him. And I want to hear that I can sit in my eyes. I'm getting old even with makeup. You can pay for that.
00:41:58
Fortunately here, Brian, this has been such a fun episode. Honestly, you are so great, so much to offer. I hope people really listen to this and just get a lot out of it. We wrap every episode by allowing you to leave a face message with the world. OK, the world. My answer back.
00:42:14
So don't check your voice messages.
00:42:16
So you've got two minutes on the clock.
00:42:19
Going to look into the camera and you're going to say whatever is on your heart and on your mind that you want to fall upon the ears of all seven billion people who watch the Kandace Show.
00:42:27
Are you ready on your mark?
00:42:28
Get set world. I give you Brian Kallet.
00:42:32
I would say at 53 years old, the thing I've learned is don't be afraid of ideas and don't be too attached to your ideas. And I'll quote the Israeli author, Amos Oz, who said, The way to beat a bad idea is with a better idea. Don't be afraid to be bested by a better idea, but be open to it. And that's why conversation and dialogue is so crucial. And when you are afraid to hear someone else's voice, you know, even Barack Obama said, I don't know why I said even, but Barack Obama said that when I disagree with someone, I listen to them twice as hard.
00:43:07
And I thought that was a really good thing to do. And I think that's very important because sometimes you don't have all the answers. Don't be so attached to your ideas.
00:43:15
And the last thing that I'll say, I love that quote balance has and I love a quote by Michelangelo, which was criticized by creating if you have a problem with someone's point of view, instead of taking to Twitter and calling them all kinds of names, how about coming up with a better idea, a better solution, an argument that they can't deny? That's how you change the world, because we keep forgetting it's not about destruction. It might also be about persuasion and changing the hearts and minds of the people you disagree with.
00:43:51
That's how we evolve. Take your ideas and pit them against somebody else's ideas and stand back and watch and keep reading and keep talking and keep listening and keep an open mind. And that's how you make the world a better place, in my opinion.
00:44:07
And have faith. Faith is important to be attached to mythology, be attached to things you can't measure. Don't be married only to rational rationality and to mathematical truths. There are certain things you can't measure. There are certain things that inspire us to laugh and to cry and forget we're human sometimes. That's what great art's about. You forget you're a biological creature. You have to go to the bathroom. You have to have sex, you have to eat.
00:44:32
Sometimes you get this arrested state of higher being. And that's also very important to so make space for faith and great art. It will feed your soul. God, that was so good and it was exactly two minutes, there's no way that was not rehearsed that was so good. Thank you guys for watching the latest episode of the Kandace own show, I hope you guys enjoyed the conversation as much as I did. As many of you guys already know.
