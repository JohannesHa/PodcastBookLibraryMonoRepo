00:00:07
Which will be good, it was like he was even trying to get euphoric, you know? Yeah, we have we've got whenever we're not often in the same place. Yeah, exactly. But we got you here now.
00:00:16
So here we are. OK, we're ready. I was speeding. OK. OK, ladies and gentlemen, we are rolling into another episode of the Candace Owens Show. And I am so excited about the guests that I have in today. I first saw this person speaking in Palm Beach, Florida, and to this day I say that the speech that was given remains the most impactful speech in my political career in terms of inspiring me to really get concerned about American politics and the direction in which the American discourse is treading.
00:00:49
And ironically, this person is not American to make me feel so patriotic. Katie Hopkins, also known as the biggest bitch in Britain.
00:01:00
I know. Quite rude, quite. It's quite rude, given that I'm actually kind of small. You are quite small. Yeah. And so I got this kind of reputation for being a monster. And so when people meet me, they're always kind of disappointed by how tiny I am.
00:01:13
That's really funny because when I met you, I met you and I was small. I was a small fish in a big pond. You were much, much bigger than me. And I always actually judge people by how they treated me then because some people were incredibly dismissive and other people were so friendly. And you were the nicest person in the entire world.
00:01:29
Oh, thank you. Were you were. So you are supposed to be blowing this for me. And you actually gave just an incredible speech that really moved me. And at this time, Brexit had not had not yet taken place. And you talked about sort of just the deterioration of your country over time you served your country.
00:01:49
I want to talk about I want to start there and talk about why you were on American soil, you know, trying to get Americans to realize how important this fight was for the values of their country.
00:01:59
So I spent quite a bit of time, I guess, on the road years back now warning Americans to not become like Britain, you know, do not fall as we have fallen.
00:02:08
I was we were Britain is a long way down a dark road that I didn't want American to come anywhere near.
00:02:16
And so I guess when you and I probably first made contact, it was way back then when I had started warning people don't become like Britain.
00:02:24
And and the kind of strangeness of that message is that I am a massive patriot. I went through university and I was sponsored by the Intelligence Corps. My father says I must have got someone else's offer because I couldn't go on my own.
00:02:40
And then I went through the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, to become an officer in the British Army and was given a 35 year regular commission in the intelligence corps. So that was the plan was 35 years intelligence corps serve my country. So I love my country.
00:02:59
But to get to a point, then when you're going to America to warn people not to become like my country as a kind of a journey and for various reasons, eventually I had to leave the army because I was also epileptic.
00:03:12
I think I might be one of the first epileptics to make it through the Royal Military Academy. And I realised in my infinite wisdom, as I've got older, more degenerate and more tired, that actually an epileptic with a semiautomatic weapon might not have been my finest idea in the history of mankind. So I had to leave the military, which I think is my calling, and hence began fighting in a different way. So that fight was then in the media.
00:03:40
I became somewhat known because I had worked for five years in Manhattan. I lived in the East Village, worked on Madison Avenue. I saw a really brilliant program over here called The Apprentice with Donald Trump.
00:03:52
And so when I went back to the UK, I thought, well, I'll go on that show. And so I went on The British Apprentice. I got to the end and then fired our equivalent of Donald Trump, little Lord Sugar Short Man.
00:04:04
Never, never work for a short person is one of my rules.
00:04:08
So I fired the guy that ran The Apprentice and then I became known. So I started fighting back for my country in the media. And that's, I guess, when our paths eventually cross. Right.
00:04:18
So what were you seeing happen happening in the UK, in in Britain that made you go something? I feel like I'm losing my country. What was it to start with?
00:04:26
It was very on the outside of stuff. You know, I had an opinion on many things. And I think unlike other people who want to be liked, that's never really been an ambition of mine to pursue that.
00:04:37
We share that lack of ambition in that category.
00:04:40
I was brought up by nuns. I mean, I was in like some weird foster home brought up just by people who believed heavily in God.
00:04:47
But I went to a Catholic school and was taught by nuns. And one of those nuns told me way back when that one thing you don't want to be as nice, never use the word nice and you don't want to be nice. And I took Sister Beath at her word.
00:05:02
And so through my early life, I always just said what I thought I won't ever employ. A fat person, I believe majority of people are lazy, not enough people work hard enough for what they want. Most people are spineless fools and won't front up to things. You know, I had an opinion on pretty much everything, parent and child parking. I mean, really, most mothers are incredibly overweight. They need to walk a bit, don't make they don't put them nearer to the supermarket front door.
00:05:27
I mean, you know, obvious things.
00:05:28
People on planes, fat people, they should be paying for themselves. I have to pay for my luggage. Check your own bingo wings in. I don't want to pay for those. Those were the sorts of opinions I started with.
00:05:40
And from there I became known as that woman that would say stuff to people's faces, like on a good morning breakfast sofa next to a fat lady saying, well, I won't employ you because you're fat and therefore you look lazy. And that's not a look I want in my business. I became known as that.
00:05:57
But as I learned, more spent more time with people. People started coming to me about their stories, about truths of my country. I changed and things became much more political and much more serious and much more concerning in the realization that the list of things that you could say was getting smaller and smaller, that there was an entire realm of things you weren't even allowed to touch on because it was unspoken and unsaid. And that actually the ability of Islam and a Muslim network to infiltrate all of the scaffolding, you know, if you imagine the a structure of society, a scaffolding or that scaffolding to be taken over and in the hands of Islam, when you start to see that happening, that's when I got very concerned.
00:06:47
And that's why I started speaking out like not becoming like us. You know, we in the UK have a Muslim police force. We have Muslim housing associations, every mayoral position. But two in the UK are held by Muslims. Muslims have infiltrated every level of society in the UK by 20, 30 Muslim births outnumber births to all others.
00:07:13
And by 2040, I'm a minority in my own country. And that's not a bad thing necessarily. But of course, when diversity means no white people at all or no people of any other faith at all, where is the diversity that there is no diversity?
00:07:29
Yeah, and it's interesting because we have a similar thing going on here where I mean, while it's not I wouldn't say a Muslim infiltration, we do have a leftist indoctrination infiltration at every single level and the same thing happen.
00:07:40
Suddenly you can't start critiquing certain things and they start saying, this is not this is not politically correct enough, it's not politically correct enough. And you kind of earn these titles. I always say I it's like Pokemon gotta catch them all. I've been called racist or sexist, a bigot, you know, a Nazi sympathizer.
00:07:56
Here we are. Prager, you apparently I'm you know, they have me out there saying I support Adolf Hitler, which I've never said, but this is what they do when you start saying things that you believe to be fundamentally true, even if it didn't even if you didn't think they were true and it was your opinion, the censorship is worrisome.
00:08:11
Right. Like, if you why can't you come out and say, I don't believe that people should be fat? And now they say not only can you not say that you need to have fat acceptance, you need to be a supporter of fat people, even though we know, especially in America, it's the number one killer. It's like saying you need to you know, you need to love cancer cells. You need to go out there and say, like, everybody needs to try to get cancer.
00:08:31
And that's sort of like a weird spot for our culture to be in when you're advocating for people to do things that are going to harm themselves. Yes. I want to start on this fat thing with you because you did something that was absolutely fascinating. And for people that are not just listening to this and are watching it, we are going to throw up an image.
00:08:48
But if you're just listening to the podcast, Keaney decided to stand by her guns in a way that I find to be absolutely incredible by gaining weight, how many pounds you gain in what span of time that you gain those pounds. Yes.
00:09:05
So I, I should preface this with I am really annoying and my annoying sort of streak is such that I will put my money where my mouth is.
00:09:14
So and that continues to this day, you know, I will show up places I'm not supposed to be. I will stay there and I will annoy people. It's the reason I'm in America right now is because I didn't really take no for an answer when I was told British people are Ebola and are no longer welcome in America. That's the reason I'm here right now, because I ignored that.
00:09:33
But in terms of fat people, people always said, oh, you're so lucky to be skinny. Well, it's all very well. You criticizing fat people. You know, my family, a fat fat runs in our family. I've got fat bones.
00:09:42
I've got fat genes, fat bones. I'm going to stick you on an x ray. You pretty much haven't.
00:09:46
You just eat your fridge.
00:09:47
And so I decided I went into a TV studio and said, I know I'll put on so 55, 60 pounds in three months and I'll lose it again in three months to prove that fat people are lazy.
00:10:00
They said, yes, done.
00:10:02
And within two weeks filming it started, at which point I recognized this was a really terribly bad. Oh, dear. I did think that maybe so for me, that sort of forced stone in British money and I'm H2O2, half my body weight on half my body weight off.
00:10:16
And I thought in some brilliant Katie land that all of that weight would go on my boobs. And I don't have boobs at the moment. They're very small indeed. For those that aren't watching, especially from podcast perspective, imagine some very small boobs. This podcast is going places we never thought it might go.
00:10:33
Let's roll with it. So I imagine putting forced down on my boobs and that would be terrific.
00:10:37
And I could show them to people and generally waggle them about in public and maybe get things for free.
00:10:43
Who what actually happened was that all of the weight went on from just at the top of my ribcage to just above my lady parts in a very unattractive and unseemly large bump that people mistook for maternity and pregnancy.
00:10:57
And my face ballooned to eight times its normal size, and it's already quite large.
00:11:02
So I became spectacularly ugly individual with a humongous tumor looking like growth just below my tiny boobs.
00:11:10
And above all, for trying to prove that fat people are lazy, which indeed I suppose I did.
00:11:14
I just ate and ate and ate and ate and got fatter and fatter and fatter and more and more disappointed and depressed and loathing of my life. Right.
00:11:23
I mean, I just can't imagine, like, what that did to your mental because I'm big into working out and if I go a month without working out for any reason, like I had to get a surgery back in January, I was on to work out. And when I say I felt depressed and I can't imagine on top of that eating and gaining weight, I mean, you must have just been emotionally on the brink. Yes.
00:11:41
And I think that's you know, I sort of trivialize it, but in many ways, actually, the learning of it was was brilliant because it the the simple fact is I wasn't allowed to tell people what I was doing.
00:11:53
And the thing I wanted most of all was an excuse. I wanted to say, oh, I'm doing this for a show. So so it's not real. I'm not really fat. And of course, what does every fat person want?
00:12:05
They want an excuse. So I was being just like them.
00:12:08
I wanted to excuse it away. Whether you call it runs in my family. I've got big bones. I want to say I'm doing a TV show, so it's not really me, I'm not really fat.
00:12:17
So I got that. I got how horrible it is to even try and get dressed. Like when women struggle with even some women to even leave their front door is a struggle because they don't feel good about themselves.
00:12:30
Well, that's precisely where I was as well. And I think you see the world differently. So I remember walking past stores where before I would have run in, grab something because I like that stuff in there.
00:12:40
You know, I'm not really big on spending ages buying clothes, so I would run and grab it out. You go and maybe try it on in the store. Look at those stores when you're a fat person and there's no way you would go in that store and try stuff on because the mirror's right there in the middle of the store. People can look in and see you trying stuff on. You see the world completely differently. And so some of the learnings out of becoming a fat person were actually really not only distressing, but allow me to be much more understanding that this thing isn't is not great at all.
00:13:12
And actually, the real message of the program was about trying to see that even if you do a little bit of exercise or can walk 10000 steps or let's try and do this together, you'll feel better about yourself.
00:13:24
Right? Right. And eventually I was joined by a little army of women who also wanted to do this journey with me. We all started doing the walk together and all of them shifted a whole bunch of weight. And it was about doing it without a gym, without a nutritionist, without any fancy equipment or any extra help. It was just having a pair of sneakers and showing we can feel better about ourselves if we try. Right. And that's kind of that's why the show was also so successful, because it ended up being nothing about laughing at fat people.
00:13:53
It wasn't that it became much more about understanding that your world is a lot harder when you're also carrying that we've got enough to deal with in our lives. Right, without making life harder, which is a truth.
00:14:05
And you would think that would be something that we would promote throughout society. I mean, I think I went online the other day and I saw a band, I mean, a brand, a sports brand.
00:14:15
And they were they had the model. She was clinically obese.
00:14:19
I mean, bigger than you are when you gain those pounds. I mean, really clinically obese. You could see, you know, through the stretch pants you were making for her. No. One, this is a size that even by selling the size, you know, I mean, you just see the dimples, the layers, the fat hanging over her things. She was not active at all, but they wanted to basically say that their corporate message was that, you know, we're welcoming and we're accepting, even though, you know, clearly this is not a woman that is active.
00:14:41
And I said to myself, I view being fat as I view being anorexic. I was anorexic when I was eight years old and I was anorexic for four years, severely anorexic.
00:14:51
You should not promoting either. Both of these are unhealthy, but you would never see a society that says be anorexic, anorexic, upset acceptance. Right. You say you need to get help. When you see a girl with women bone, she needs to get help. You know, they go after them in the press. She needs to get help. She's anorexic. She's not eating. But what? The opposite token, it's all about make them feel better.
00:15:09
Shame is a good ingredient. Yeah, I think it's true. I think it's also linked to so in the UK, obviously, we have socialized health care, the NHS. So in America, I suppose in some ways, if you have medical issues, those are internalized. So the person is paying for them themselves. You have private health care. Often people pay for their own health care issues. So in some ways I'd say in America, well, it's choice because you're going to pay to fix it in the UK as a taxpayer, I'm going to pay for your choices is why I'm anti socialized health care, because I have to pay for choices other people make in their life.
00:15:44
And that's not actually something I want to do. You're going to need new knees or new hip because you've decided to eat your own fridge or 85 times the amount of food that you probably should have. I don't want to pay for your new hip. You go buy yourself a new hip. And that sounds hard, but actually it's just basic economics 100 percent.
00:16:02
I also think there's a you know, at the moment with everybody going around like crazy with these masks on, you see people who are clearly clinically obese with a mask on. And it reminds me of people that go into like a Starbucks or whatever and order a hot chocolate with skim milk. And then the cashier says, would you like cream? And they go, Oh, yes, please.
00:16:21
That's what masks are on. Fat people right there. The the cream that you squirt on top when you've had skim milk, I think that one thing's going to save them. And one thing is going to. Yeah, I told your mouth is not going to save you from koruna if you get it because you're massive. Right.
00:16:35
That's one hundred percent. And it's a real conversation.
00:16:37
But no one's going to have that conversation. And I have I have it the whole time, which is why I'm always in trouble like you are just a few steps ahead of me. Yes, I. A few steps ahead of me. Yeah, well, we're in the same category where it's just having meaningful, honest discussions. And like I say, my favorite thing in the whole world, by the way, you know, to wrap up the fact discussion is when I'm at the gym and I see a fat person on a treadmill, I'm like, go, you know?
00:16:56
I mean, like you're working out. I love it because you're trying to do something to change your life positively. But when I see a fat person modeling on Instagram and saying fat acceptance, that makes me angry.
00:17:05
I agree. But I would also say, you know, we're all arseholes. And if I'm running and I'm running, I will deliberately try and run past someone and I'll hold my breath and try not to look sweaty so I look tougher than them.
00:17:17
So let's not forget also there's an undercurrent of being an asshole. Yeah, there is. And I also deliver on that. Right. Well, I would say I do too.
00:17:25
Yeah, it's important. How did you get censored from Twitter? You've been censored quite a bit and I don't want to hear her speak. How do you get censored.
00:17:35
Well, I suppose the sort of longer a bit to this and I'm going to do it in brief, is that because I became known, because I became then it's very annoying person that did things like put on weight to prove that people are lazy. I then ended up with columns in the national newspaper. I was a columnist for Mail Online. I had the show on radio, LBC radio show on a Sunday that was the most listened to radio show on a Sunday for commercial radio.
00:18:01
So I became a kind of regular face and voice in the mainstream press. I was the mainstream kid, but over time, as I became more aware of the truths of my country and others, and travelling specifically with migrants across the Med or travelling to places other people wouldn't go, the jihadi capital of Europe, Belgium, I spent a week there in a burqa uncovering some of what was going on that I became that person. And that person with a big audience had to be silenced because I was now going against many things in the establishment, certainly against the leftist Labour Party, the Muslim Council, the Board of Deputies, Jewish organisations, big players were involved in having me removed.
00:18:47
The chief rabbi was involved in having me removed from my mail online column.
00:18:53
So but one by one, I lost all of those things. I lost my column.
00:18:58
I was removed from my radio show and eventually go on a few years and we end up with one point one million followers on Twitter. You'll know how Twitter works. You end up with a much bigger following, but they can't be seen to follow you. So they stalk you via Google. Crazy. And I became that person that couldn't be shut up. And in some of my more recent activities, I dressed up as a Black Lives Matter protest, which essentially dressing like an arsehole, looking like a vegan that you wouldn't want to sit next to at a wedding.
00:19:28
I dressed as that lady and went to the Black Lives Matter protests and and that stuff on Twitter obviously flow. And that's why that was the point at which I was removed from the platform Black Lives Matter.
00:19:39
It's incredible how many people lost their platforms for speaking out against Black Lives Matter. I would have definitely been in that category, had not been for the fact that I'm black. Yes. So it's a bit trickier for them to censor to, you know, censor me on the basis of my racist views. Yeah, well, I'm and that's the tricky spot that I have a Latina.
00:19:54
They don't know quite how to stop me out there.
00:19:56
It's very easy. You've got blue eyes, blonde hair, and you're white. You're evil.
00:20:00
I don't know how it would work if we if we did a sweep of Swapper or if I could become a black lady, if I was a black.
00:20:05
Katie Hopkins, I think was like, oh, I don't know what to do with that. Yeah, we thought 2020 was really shit. But this is a new level thing, like a black Katie Hopkins. How are we going to set up. Exactly.
00:20:15
Yeah, I think it just, you know, people ask me, well, why did you get banned from Twitter? And you can't go for a rational argument that was never well being white.
00:20:23
Yeah. So you only can say that you ended up with too much, you know, influence ahead of a U.S. election. Trump had tweets me, retweeted me, you know, and and last time he retweeted me, they took my paper.
00:20:37
All this time they took my account. You know, it's they take something every time. Right.
00:20:42
But I think what's weird probably for an American audience is just how you know about cancer culture, you know, about people losing their jobs.
00:20:50
But I guess for me in the UK, things are more stark.
00:20:54
You know, I feel very free still here in America. I, I feel emotional at American airports because I, I love it here and I love what you have.
00:21:04
Whereas in the UK, you know, I am now a target, certainly a physical target. I know you relate to that certain. I think it's become an acceptable view that a targeted attack on me physically would be welcomed and applauded. You know, a couple of jihadis came to cut my head off. There was a plot to behead me in the UK that was foiled. And those jihadis are now in prison. But a team of men dressed in black came to my house late one evening and set my home up with panic alarms.
00:21:37
I mean, it was quite exciting for a moment. Most of them are very muscular with very nice bottoms. And I was like, this is fantastic.
00:21:43
But it turned out some jihadis wanted to chop my head off.
00:21:46
And they told me that should someone come into my home, didn't give me the details, I should run to the top floor of my house, shake this panic box, you know, and the police would come.
00:21:58
That plot was foiled. They're in prison, as I say. But then the British government went on further and funded a play called The Assassination of Katie Hopkins. We can probably get those graphics up.
00:22:08
But, you know, so I think when you become when you have a play written about you, that's the assassination of Katie Hopkins after there's been a jihadi plot to behead you and they take all of your jobs. They came from my home with litigation put together by religious communities, Muslim Council and others. So my family home had to be sold to get rid of the litigation against me. I now own nothing and have nothing. And then they come for your children, so my children are reported to social services to try and have those removed from me.
00:22:41
So I think that that the story, I suppose in the UK, that is the darkness, is that when they come, it's not something flippant that is cancer or culture.
00:22:50
It is taking you to the point where I truly believe they will only stop when they find that you will swing from a tree.
00:22:58
Mm hmm. And so my fundamental commitment, and it helps to have children is not to let them win that.
00:23:04
Right. And so I will not swing from a tree. And so that's cancer culture.
00:23:09
You're getting a sense of it here in America, but the darkness is far darker.
00:23:13
Well, there's a quickening of it, I think, now in America. And as you're saying this and I and I know what the argument is like, again, different countries. But you are correct that there is a you know, a dominant Muslim structure. It's shocking within the U.K. But also, I think here we're seeing the early seeds of a dominant Black Lives Matter culture. Yes, you are. And that I mean, obviously, it's especially troubling for me to say because I'm a part of the black community so I can operate under the radar when I see what is allowed and sanctioned.
00:23:41
The outward racism, chasing white people down in the streets, videos of people demanding in restaurants that they white people put up a fist in, say, black power. I get shouted down, burning, looting, businesses and the sanctioning of it, meaning, you know, Target gets burned down and as opposed to coming out and saying this is wrong, the corporate society issued a statement saying, we understand. Yeah, right. And I saw yesterday, I saw in the news it was just a video of them going door to door in the suburbs, telling them to evacuate their homes as they were going to burn them down.
00:24:15
You know, and all of this is somehow being sanctioned by the leftist media, the institution of the schools, the institutions, the.
00:24:23
And I think to myself, what you're talking about could happen very quickly here. Here. Yes, it unravels very quickly.
00:24:29
Yes, it is a sort of we're going down this sort of spectrum. It's almost like a linear scale. Right. So we may have it from the fact that we're being taken over by Islam. Yours is certainly a destabilization that's coming down. The left is Black Lives Matter, provided the cover for that. Right.
00:24:44
And as you rightly point out, you know, many people will have seen the footage of the Black Lives Matter more, mostly white individuals actually threatening diners outside saying raise your fist. And I think if people watch those videos again and observe the actual problem there for me is not even so much the mob or the aggression of the mob. The problem for me is the white guy sat next to the the two who raises his fist because what he's doing there, he's not at all with Black Lives Matter.
00:25:13
Probably he's protecting himself and the willingness of individuals to align themselves with the thing that will hurt you in order to preserve your own safety for a limited period of time is the very thing that is our weakness.
00:25:29
Right. And of course, in the UK, we see that with our Jewish communities, leftist Jewish communities, who ally themselves with the Muslim Council and Muslim infiltration, believing it will save them. And history has taught us surely that align yourself with the thing that will harm you, will not save you in the long term. That's correct. And so that gentleman to me and all of that footage and all of the mayhem, it's the gentleman with the moustache.
00:25:54
Not only should white men who are overweight not have mustaches, I mean, that's clearly ridiculous to start.
00:25:59
But him raising his hat and what what puts the fire in my soul is that if I had only been there, I said that to me, it happened where I live.
00:26:10
I was like where I was. I wasn't there when I would have stood in front of them, wouldn't you? I would have and I would have screamed and I just.
00:26:16
Are you kidding me? For eating and being white. That was their crime. They were willing to dream of being. I just. I hope. I just hope it happens. It well, it will come. I hope I'm there.
00:26:27
The main message to people, you know, it's not fight. It's not people that well, they would have had their teeth knocked out. It's not that it's stand still a minute that starts to happen to you. Please stand, because when you stand you will feel the power will come to you.
00:26:42
And even by standing, you are now a more dominant force. Right. So stand.
00:26:47
And that's it. That's why I'm here. That's why I'm here now. It's about standing and keeping standing. So the minute I bounced in from cleansing myself of Britain, in the Bahamas, Barbados, actually, I went straight to Skid Row and filmed in Skid Row because that's how we stand. This is go show people what they're going to get. Go show stuff that American journalists seem to be too idol to go show. Let's go show people what they're going to get if they vote Democrat.
00:27:17
And that's the fire and that's the fire you have. And that's why so many people applaud you. I mean, I think on a daily basis, probably a lot of what you hear is a tax and people having a go. You're sending your unkindness or trying to belittle you or do whatever to you. But what you should know and what. You need to hear more strongly and what you deserve to hear is that you are fighting the good fight and there's so many people that are so proud of everything you're doing your vital right now in this fight.
00:27:47
And that's always what I hope for you, is to be able to amplify how important you are. And I'm sure your audience feel that way about anyone that tells the truth.
00:27:57
You know, and that's I mean, what you're talking about in terms of saying, like, the person that stands by eventually they're going to come at you, too. I don't understand that. And I'm not sure if they do it because they think this will protect me, which might be true. But that that wasn't the only instance. This was a day of going to a different restaurant and doing this. And another woman who refused to raise her fist at a restaurant then gave an interview after to The Washington Post.
00:28:22
And she said the irony is she supports Black Lives Matter. She just said, the mayor, that they came at her. She felt threatened, she felt unsafe, and she didn't feel that that was an appropriate thing to do. And they didn't care. They didn't ask and say, do you support Black Lives Matter? It was in this instant, you do this or you're going to get, you know, screamed at and shouted out. And I think that has to be a wake up call for her.
00:28:40
What are you supporting? If you think that you're going to be saved the day, if you think that they care how how you vote or who you support when they're burning and rioting your neighborhood, like there's something you can post that lets them know you're with them. They don't care. You know, we're talking about a radical group. You know, this is this Black Lives Matter Antifa. This is a form of jihadism.
00:28:59
You're throwing Molotov cocktails. What is that in America? So trespassing and Molotov cocktails never been a thing in America.
00:29:05
And now there are things they think they think that, you know, that I've seen them or heard in Minnesota, stories of people who have these lone you have these lone things that you can push into your lawn that you banners and things, political banners, they have Black Lives Matter ones, and they're putting them onto their lawn, not because they're with Black Lives Matter, but they're looking to indicate to people that they are with Black Lives Matter in order to try and protect their property.
00:29:29
Right. Same for restaurants and various businesses that it is. Put it up.
00:29:33
And I guess the only question there is, OK, so when things go wrong and people start attacking your home, who are you going to call? And not in Ghostbusters reference. Right. But who are you going to call? Because you're going to call law enforcement. Surely.
00:29:45
So make a decision now. Are you with Black Lives Matter or are you with law enforcement? And when someone attacks your home, are you going to call Black Lives Matter for help? Really? And so, you know, my next mission, I think, is probably headed towards Minnesota. There's a few lawn signs that I'll be switching over.
00:30:03
I think when I wrote I love it, it's coming. What exactly happened when you posed as a Black Lives Matter protester? Well, I mean, crazily enough. So I'm there in my I use my Meghan Markle wig, actually a wig I have for my Meghan Markle impressions just to annoy the left.
00:30:18
But so I have that on. I had a very sad anorak on.
00:30:22
And one of the there's a lot of these sort of white allies that they shop in Whole Foods. They you know, they they definitely want to remain. They would never Brexit. And now they're going to I'm white. I stand. What is it? I don't understand, but I stand.
00:30:36
So you have to sympathize. I'm so sorry for being white and being here. I don't understand.
00:30:42
But look at me.
00:30:42
I'm on my knee and I stand Floyd, George, Floyd does that sort of ridiculous level of white person.
00:30:49
I mean, for God's sake, get a grip your spine. So I went along and there was a few of those white people that I would understand, but I, I apologize.
00:30:56
And one of them actually said to go home, presumably violin lessons or Spanish lessons for her children with the maid. I don't know.
00:31:03
She gave me her sign, which was perfect. So I had this sign that then said, I don't understand where I stand. So I was doing that. So I'm there being a Black Lives Matter protester watching this lock, because I want to I genuinely there I want to understand them, because if you understand them, you can talk about them honestly.
00:31:19
And that's all I ever want to do, is talk honestly. And I can't bear people who sit in their lounge speaking to themselves, which is majority of male reporters or columnists or commentators, from what I can see.
00:31:29
Get out of your lounges, you spineless fools.
00:31:32
Anyway, so I'm there. She gives me I sign on there and there's signs going up with these Black Lives Matter guys, you know, big kind of tough looking guys.
00:31:41
There's my name on their side. Say, Katie Hopkins is the problem. Katie Hopkins, go get Katie Hopkins. So my name is on their signs because I'm kind of, you know, a tall guy in the UK and I'm there pretending to be this scared white person.
00:31:56
And anyhow, then it got out because after I'd cleared the area, I posted social media and it got out that I was there. They believed I was still amongst them.
00:32:05
So the hunt started for my skin.
00:32:08
And I'm like on the train home watching this unfold. But I guess my learning was that Black Lives Matter was a fundamentally flawed thing in the UK.
00:32:17
Not only George Floyd was on the other side of the Atlantic, so let's not pretend he's our brother. To your point, he's not the second coming of Christ or Martin Luther King either.
00:32:27
And then it was funny because they all masked and tens of thousands of them massed. It was a well mobilized event.
00:32:34
But when they all. Got to where I was being a spineless white person apologizing for being white, they didn't know what to do next, so they did the silence. They went on their knee great.
00:32:45
And they said, say his name, George Floyd, say his name George Floyd, say his name. Not getting a little bit repetitive, darling, at this point.
00:32:53
And then eventually they all went. I looked around and the truth of the Black Lives Matter movement is it doesn't know where it's going. They didn't know where they were going. And I mean that geographically, they didn't have a destination to march to. And I mean, that's a theory. And I mean, in every way, they don't know where where are you going? Where are you trying to get to? Because unless you know what your aim is, you're what and you're why military principles.
00:33:23
Marvelous.
00:33:25
You're not going anywhere. And that's why you're shouting at diners eating a burger on a restaurant because you don't know where to channel your.
00:33:33
And it's time to throw ten temper tantrums. Right.
00:33:35
But you're going in a circle, right. And that was my learning that day was watching them after they did the thing and they did the fist and they did the kneeling.
00:33:43
I didn't know where to go next.
00:33:45
And and so I'd love, in a way, as a strategic coordinator for the campaign, I could be really effective so I could channel that quite efficiently. I'd have to apologize for being white, obviously, but they need an aim. But I think one of the genius things about Black Lives matter, of course, and I think it's a learning for Republicans everywhere, is call yourself something people can't possibly disagree with. So I'm going to run a campaign and I'm going to call it water is wet.
00:34:10
Yes, water is wet. Yes, it is. Yes. And it's not a drinking water is. What is the name? Yes.
00:34:20
Just say something that's already true. Oxygen is important, right? Yes.
00:34:24
Oxygen is important in his name. Oxygen is a boy. So say something that people have to fundamentally disagree with.
00:34:30
And then I would do a physical reenactment, but I think cameras will kill me, do something that's dramatic. So taking a knee. So if Republicans are going to go one better than Black Lives Matter, maybe we can prostrate ourselves on the ground. So, one, they're kneeling. We go lower right here, right, left.
00:34:48
I'm going to have jelly fish. I know this is going to be the right.
00:34:52
So they will go on their knees and then we just don't know what is wet.
00:34:58
And then see, that looks very important. Yeah. Yeah, it looks it looks more important because if they're on their knees and we're just laying right.
00:35:05
Like flat. Flat. Yeah. Planking. Yeah. So like go physically one lower there and then you just go that's an important move. Right.
00:35:12
And then if you want to do your oxygenation you could go subterranean. So you dig a little trench, just keep going physically lower till you win. That's broken. So foolish. And people fall for this stuff.
00:35:21
Oh, I mean do you fall for this stuff? And it's so funny to me how many people say they support Black Lives Matter and they've never visited the website and seen what their goals are, which has nothing to do with black lives. I mean, it's incredible.
00:35:32
They use the face of George Foy. They use a face of Ronald Taylor. They use a face of a ton of other criminals like criminals, which is amazing that black criminals are now like it's a it's a good thing.
00:35:40
You have a lot of potential to score millions if you're a black criminal in a bazaar, if you just are a black criminal and you have a conversation with police and you resist arrest and do criminal things while they're trying to arrest you, you can score millions for your family.
00:35:51
It's so true. That is no bizarre world. We live in breaking news. If you want to be shot by the police, maybe do what they're asking you to do.
00:35:58
And then that's controversial, right? I know. I am so racist. How dare you? It's hard. We can't do that. I would censor myself, but I've already been censored.
00:36:08
And I say it all the time. It's I mean, it's it's such the bigotry of low expectations. Like, we can't listen, you know, we can't we just cannot follow simple instructions to not further. I mean, you can box a police officer like we saw with the robbery case where he was literally Pakistani.
00:36:20
A police officer took the police officer's taser fired at him and they still donated those families.
00:36:27
I would love you know, I would love to get these spineless white people.
00:36:30
I'm picking on white people on purpose because I spent time with them at these protests.
00:36:34
I would love to dress them in a police officer's uniform, put them into, you know, parts of New York now or put them into parts of downtown now and say, see how you go, try feeling.
00:36:47
It's a feeling, feel that fear. You go feel that fear with that uniform on knowing that your target in the way that physically you're a target here.
00:36:57
To some extent, certainly I'm a target in the UK just to show my face.
00:37:02
I feel that fear and feel that coursing through your body now.
00:37:06
Now start to speak about how you feel about the police, you know, and that is the sort of always we can be guilty of shouting a lot and repeating ourselves on our side.
00:37:17
But the most powerful truth of everything we do is that it's to do with a feeling, you know, and if you can help people to feel what it's like, like like the Skid Row thing, help people to feel what that's like to be on that pavement with all those people who have nothing and no hope and are out of their minds, you know, where a black lives matter for these black people.
00:37:39
You just ask them the quiet questions. I agree because our message is actually a lot softer.
00:37:44
And I also know that our side has a lot more humanity to it and a lot more caring. And that's a very lovely thing. Right. And I think Melania actually with her talk at the convention. The RNC did a really nice job of that. I did, and I think that's the truth of our site and perhaps we've lost a little bit of our way with that when we shout a lot.
00:38:05
Yeah, I agree. I totally agree. And there is an element of compassion. I think we've become too, too common for us to say facts don't care about your feelings.
00:38:14
I always say to conservatives, but the feelings don't care about your facts. Right?
00:38:17
So you need to make people feel something, have to feel they have to. You have to, you know, be a little more compassionate. And then that's really how you get people to transform. Exactly.
00:38:25
One of my challenges to our side is, you know, if you're a speaker on the circuit, I'm really thinking more about middle aged men here. If you are speaker, that's always being booked for speeches. You know, my challenge to you is, did you write that for the room? Did you did you think of something? Did you go and do something to feel it, to tell the room, or are you giving them the same speech that you gave last week because, you know, you can get away with it.
00:38:51
And my message to you then is be much better than that, because lots of people would love the opportunity to speak. And lots of people I'd love to have more platforms, but if you're going to be invested in them, given the the spectacular privilege of speaking to a room, invest in that privilege, tell them something new and don't repeat yourself.
00:39:14
Right.
00:39:15
You know, bring them something you've just seen or done a different experience. Yeah. Yeah. Make people feel something. Yes. Yeah.
00:39:22
So you were telling me earlier, which I had no idea that you were epaulet epileptic. Yeah. How does that play into everything? I mean, it's just fascinating. I never knew this. I've known you know, I followed your story quite a bit and I never knew that you had epilepsy.
00:39:34
I know it was my secret. Yes. So one of my many secrets, one is that I'm actually a man.
00:39:41
No, people usually call me.
00:39:44
So when people are being mean, obviously, you know, they're terribly mean about my nose and things like I, I call myself the human sundial just to try and laugh back in their face, get called horse face, whatever, when they're accusing me of being trans. Because obviously that's funny if you're saying about me. But obviously we have to respect if you're actually trans, right?
00:40:01
I'm not I'm not actually trans. I deviated off the epilepsy starting point.
00:40:07
We're getting back that we're going to come around, takes a while. We're going to come back.
00:40:13
So I was born not with epilepsy, but by about eighteen I was having fits and but they were like pauses like initial epilepsy is kind of weird. So you can have these things pet him our little bad in French and and she just sort of you there. And then you paused. Then you come back and people say, you're right. Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. And I got used to hiding. Oh I'm fine. I'm so fine.
00:40:38
I wasn't fine and I knew I wasn't fine.
00:40:40
And then I was determined I was going to be in the military, I was going to fight for my country. And I knew you couldn't be epileptic and fight for your country.
00:40:47
So I hid it and I hid it in every single element of my life for for twenty years.
00:40:54
Every job I tried to get, I didn't tell anyone every even through the academy until I had to be removed because I knew it was a weakness.
00:41:03
And I wouldn't admit to weakness that if I wasn't going to get a job, fine, no problem. But I didn't want to believe I might not get that job because I was epileptic. And so I would hide it. And it got to the point that my fits were extreme. So I was filming. I had my own show for a while.
00:41:19
Katie rules the world, which obviously would be a brilliant world.
00:41:24
I even dressed as an air hostess and did some checking it of fat people, making them pay for their fat like it was a brilliant show.
00:41:30
Anyway, even when I was doing Catering to the world, my fiance at night time were severe.
00:41:37
So I would my fits have broken my back. They would dislocate my arms and that's why. So I've had my arms reattached.
00:41:45
I'm kind of like a bit like Terminator these days, but so I had them sewn back in.
00:41:50
But I dislocated one or both of my arms forty five times and they would dislocate with my fits in the night.
00:41:58
Do you mean seizures. Seizures. Yeah. Then go to E.R., have your arms relocated and then present in the morning as if I was normal. And I lived that life for a very long time.
00:42:09
And then it got to the point where if it was going to get me. So that was the prognosis. A seizure, sorry, within two years a seizure would end it. You know, there would be no more. And so every morning, actually, for fifteen years or so, I would text my husband.
00:42:26
My husband changed, had two husbands, but my husband and I'd say, I'm still here and I text my mom still here. And I do that every morning because and luckily I, I ended up getting a surgery.
00:42:40
So there was a massive fit that sent me crashing to the floor in the middle of the traffic in London. And that's what gave me the courage to go and have surgery. And then that's what led to me being cured.
00:42:51
But because we have socialized health care, the wait list for my surgery was. Three years, and if it was supposed to get me two, so what I tried to fight for an amusing anecdote as to why socialized health care and queuing and rationing isn't so great.
00:43:05
But anyway, the thing I wanted to show you, because it's a secret you don't know about me, right? Yes.
00:43:10
How how grossed out are you? How easily do you.
00:43:14
Not very seriously. I'm going to after my I'm going to get you to come here.
00:43:19
OK, so the idea is that you put a flat hand on here and then fill there. Oh, my goodness.
00:43:28
So now I'm going to get you to push here and then feel.
00:43:32
Can you feel that move? Oh, my goodness. That's my brain. Yeah. Oh, my goodness.
00:43:37
So just I was just I never touched a brain before. And now that is.
00:43:42
I mean, obviously, it's a massive brangus. I'm a Republican. So, like, if it was Democrat, right. Yeah. So so I'm going to describe that for people that are. Yeah. Not like.
00:43:52
Oh yes, of course. I'm sorry. It feels like a ditch.
00:43:57
It's a ditch in her head and like an egg. A boiled egg. Yes, it's a ditch. And then within that ditch you can just feel her brain. So you can it's it's mushy. Yeah.
00:44:07
And then if I squeeze my stomach muscles which I've never touched a brain before, that was like, wow, you have that. That's so cool. I'm assuming they couldn't replace the skull. Yes.
00:44:16
And that's the really annoying thing. In fact, this lift off, is there something terrible?
00:44:20
Let's try it.
00:44:21
I just I don't want it like, you know, in terms of props and you. Yeah.
00:44:25
Oh, oh, look, I didn't know there were treats as a dead hamster and someone's apparently eating all the treats in the middle of this table. Who left a dead hamster on the counter. So in podcast, how inappropriate is this, actually?
00:44:40
Fits perfectly, right? So this is what I need in a fascinator.
00:44:43
I know this podcast has taken another peculiar look, but that's essentially the bit of skull that we didn't line that up, did we? I just thought it really it does fit. That's my skull that I'm missing.
00:44:56
That is incredible. I know. So so they just normally, I guess. How do you how do you replace a skull? No, you do. That's the point.
00:45:02
So when they they go in with a with that circular saw, I'm feeling I need to sort of message your podcast.
00:45:10
People listening.
00:45:11
I feel like I was good. I feel like they need to go and find a link to watch this visually.
00:45:16
Right. Do you see what I'm saying? Right. I'm just feeling podcast. People are going to miss something, right.
00:45:20
You're going to have to watch the YouTube. We're going to have to we're going to have to. Yeah. Anyhow, so.
00:45:25
So they go in with a circular saw where they chop off this bit of my skull.
00:45:31
Right. And then I'm thinking like in the surgical room we put it on a shelf. Right.
00:45:34
I go, OK, go, there's my skull.
00:45:37
Then they went into my brain.
00:45:38
They found the tumor thing and they which I blame my father for because obviously genetically I'm deficient in many ways and gave me this nose and he obviously gave me the brain tumor that led to my seizures that led to me being removed from the army.
00:45:53
So I blame my father as my bid for a big amount of the will. So they went in, got the tumor out, threw it away, and then they very kindly got this off the shelf where maybe they had their cigarette break. I don't know. And they put it back in. OK, good. So now we good right though. So Dallah brought me back to life boom. But then it went in medical terms. I think we call it monkey monkey.
00:46:19
Well, a little bit like would you call those items in there the dead food? What was that? A bit off but stale. Right.
00:46:26
That's what went wonky. Bit wonky monkey.
00:46:29
So that's what happened with my skull. I got meningitis, actually, so I got meningitis as an infection. And so they had to open it all back up again, get the 52 staples off my head and get my bit of skull.
00:46:42
And then they threw it away. They just threw it away. I know they got some very liquid out. What do you call the stuff? Clorox. What do you do? You clean your dishes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You have a clean water.
00:46:51
You say I can cancel from everything. I now wash dishes.
00:46:58
So they went in with some Clorox and they hand sanitized my head and then they threw away my skull. They didn't give it to you. Right. That I want that as an ashtray. Yes.
00:47:06
Yeah, I did so very rudely socialized health care.
00:47:12
They just took my skull in the bin.
00:47:14
I mean, I would have been a really cool souvenir to have because you could just bring it.
00:47:17
I would not have brought I'd have worn it out of water over. I've got a female front bottom. Wow. So how long did this, like, take. Oh yeah. So I was finish just off of being in hospital like three months and obviously the hair came off.
00:47:33
Right. And I had no hair, had fifty two staples it er and three months later I went straight actually into my radio show and I didn't know at the time if I would have the functioning call on words or anything to do radio.
00:47:54
But, but it came back so that they call it the deficit.
00:47:58
I mean medical people are weird.
00:48:00
Fouche is a very good example of how weird medical people are. Not only is fat, weird and medical, but he's also short. And as we referred to earlier, if it wasn't edited out, never, ever go near short.
00:48:10
People got actually. So medical people are weird, but so they call it the deficit.
00:48:18
Who said Republicans aren't funny? I don't think any of us that we are funny. I'm funny.
00:48:25
So, yeah, they call it the deficit. So the deficit from this surgery was all the things that were really bloody annoying.
00:48:32
I'm left handed. And so that was a deficit, left arm, left leg, maybe site and speech.
00:48:40
And those things are kind of important to who I am was.
00:48:44
So I always said the deficit means you don't get that back. Means if the operation goes wrong, those are the things you lose your ability to use your arm, your leg, your speech or your site, because that's where the bit of brain was. And so I'd always made a thing with my husband. I'd rather not come back at all, then come back missing those things. And I can still remember waking up in ICU and the first thing I can feel, the first thing I did was wiggled my left big toe and I could feel it.
00:49:14
And they were kind of gathering around and doing that sort of faeces. They do like you're half dead. And I was I could feel my big toe. I can feel it because in that hospital where I had this surgery, I can remember the upset of going to meetings before the surgery where everybody in that place was dragging their leg, you know, dragging their left leg or their right leg. And I mean this respectfully to anybody with epilepsy or any parent.
00:49:39
Of a child with epilepsy, but those hospitals can be in the hospital of horrors because you're looking at what your future might be like and I've always found epilepsy.
00:49:49
Weird is one of the cruelest conditions. There's nothing you don't see. Many charities raising money for epileptics because it's not a fluffy dog or a pretty donkey is an ugly and cruel condition.
00:50:01
And the joy of the thing was that I think I think I'm one of the most successful surgeries they've had in that I came back normal, which really obviously pissed off the left as well.
00:50:12
I last to decided we're going to get out. I've got a good she's still got the treatment of meningitis. Damn it, she's still going. They were so close, so close to Avebury.
00:50:25
They're so glad they were wrong. They could feel like they were almost starting to. There's a song that they had when Thatcher was killed.
00:50:32
Right. And killed. She died. The witch is dead right there.
00:50:36
Yeah. Did they really think that? Yeah. That went to number one in the charts.
00:50:40
The left were really impressed with themselves because they got the witches dead trending.
00:50:44
So that's the big plan for when I croquette. The big idea is that the witch is dead.
00:50:48
Will trend. Yeah, but you failed. I was like, yes, she's back. But my point rather being I got cured from my epilepsy.
00:50:56
And actually that's the reason.
00:50:57
Now, the joy of this thing is that I, I have this new life that I wasn't going to have.
00:51:05
I'm on extra time already because this time wasn't supposed to be mine. And it means I can live utterly. I don't have things. I don't have a home. I can't have savings. They'll come for that. I don't have things. And also I don't have fear.
00:51:20
And because of that, I'm probably one of the most free people on the planet, potentially, because the two things that limit people are the wish to preserve the things they have.
00:51:35
So a home or a job or a family or a wife or a husband and the wish to preserve life.
00:51:41
And I haven't got financial stuff anymore because I can't have it in the UK and my life is already an additional extra. So so I get supercharged. And so that's why all of this is fun. And I think it's part of the reason I can find the funny a lot. Right, because it's very freeing.
00:52:01
Well, I totally agree with you. I mean, I feel in many ways the same way. And I think humour is so important.
00:52:09
And a lot of times you find in political space, people take themselves way too seriously, seriously.
00:52:14
And I have had people that like, hey, I'll make fun of someone genuinely making fun of them. That's funny. And people get super upset about it. And just like, how how could you make.
00:52:21
I'm like, how can you go through life taking yourself so incredibly seriously when life, you know, life hand everybody just, you know, a bad a bad deck of cards and you have to be able to laugh yourself, do it, especially in politics.
00:52:35
You've got especially in politics. And we need to laugh more. And that's kind of my ambition from here.
00:52:40
I broke in her via just by going through quarantine because I'm not allowed to be here. So we're harboring a criminal.
00:52:47
John Abraham.
00:52:48
Yeah.
00:52:49
An Ebola ridden British woman who's obviously a Nazi and a fascist and a sexist and many of those things. But I won't leave and I intend to cause as much problem to the left as I can while I'm here. And I intend to do as well with a sense of fun because there is much to laugh at and with. We need to laugh at ourselves much more. We need to laugh at the things that threaten us like Black Lives Matter.
00:53:16
You know, water is wet. Just shout back at them, lie on the floor, prostrate yourself more than they can kneel.
00:53:22
And I think by humour we win. You know, humour is one of the most powerful tools that we have.
00:53:27
While I can I can rap by telling you, Katy, that I am an ally and I don't understand, but I stand with you, OK?
00:53:37
Oh my God. Never apologize for your blackness. And I would apologize for my wife.
00:53:41
So sorry for being black and I don't understand, but I stand. So we actually rap every episode by allowing you to leave a face message with the world.
00:53:52
You're going to look into this camera and just say what's on your heart? Like, you know what you know, why are you here? What do you believe in?
00:53:58
What is your life? Why are you here doing this? You're down. How are you here with half your skull missing? You know, just leave it for our audience so they can understand on your mark.
00:54:08
Get set world. I give you Miss Katie Hopkins.
00:54:13
So I think one of the things that's really important right now is the sense that people have never felt so lonely.
00:54:19
People have never felt so, you know, on their own.
00:54:23
You've been uninvited from things you have family members not speaking to. You asked to find another synagogue, perhaps some of your own family no longer wanting you to come to events.
00:54:35
And I'm here to tell you that none of that's true. I'm here to tell. That you are not on your own, you aren't couldn't be less lonely because we are many and we are strong in no and when we stand together and we roar, our voices really are heard.
00:54:54
And I can say this to you personally, if you're an American is the reason I'm here in your country. And I broke into this country because I need you, because we are looking to you for hope. We need you to stand up for all that is bright and you are fighting for the light and Europe looks to you for hope. And together, we will make a last stand for all that is right. And my final plea this, that if you don't do that, if you don't stand and fight, I will come and find you and I have a special set of skills and I will take you down.
00:55:29
And that is my promise to you.
00:55:33
Do you know how much my husband's is going to love that ending? He says it's one of his favorite, like one of his favorite movie, cause I have a special set of skills. Do you have a bloody special?
