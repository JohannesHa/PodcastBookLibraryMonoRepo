00:00:11
So I'll do a soft opening and turn over to you and you'll be OK. I just totally had a pregnancy brain function. I got it, OK? This. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are rolling into another episode of The Candace Owens Show. So I noticed this thing recently.
00:00:28
I live in Washington, D.C., and every time I get into an Uber car, the Uber driver happens to be an immigrant from Africa and they are all conservative.
00:00:38
Every last single one of these African immigrants is conservative and they usually recognize me and they start a conversation with me about black Americans. And the conversation usually ends with them asking what is wrong with black Americans? How could black Americans possibly view themselves as oppressed? And I often think this as well. Maybe the problem with black Americans is that we have actually no connection to the continent of Africa. And at the same time that we are squealing, that we've been taken from our homeland, we have no idea what actually goes on in Africa.
00:01:15
Very excited about having this next guest because she is an immigrant from Africa and she's lived in America for a very long time. And there is so much for us to delve in here, so much to learn from African immigrants. And I hope that all Americans, but especially black Americans, listen to this episode. Melissa Thate, welcome to the Qantas own show.
00:01:35
Thank you so much for having me, Candice. So I do want to give the audience a background.
00:01:38
You actually have a very big Twitter profile as well. You are at the right, Melissa. Yes, I remember when I was getting started and kind of looking at what conservatives were black.
00:01:49
You were one of the accounts that I followed right away. Right. And I had no idea that you spent the first 17 years of your life, 19 years of your life in Africa. You do not have an accent. So I still when you told me this the other day, I was like, what?
00:02:05
And you're from, of all places, Zimbabwe. Yes. Zimbabwe, where Robert Mugabe was the prime minister.
00:02:12
I wrote down the dates from 1980 to 1987 before he became the president in 1987. That ended in 2017. And there is no better person to talk about when you're talking about the harms of socialism and how swift it can happen than Robert Mugabe.
00:02:31
So I want to start with what was what was it like when you grew up in Africa? So basically, you know, growing up in Africa, my story begins in a small town in a small town called Rustavi. And there I grew up as a, you know, just a young kid that loved living in Zimbabwe. My mother later moved to the bigger city, which is Harare. And Harare is a beautiful was a beautiful city, very cosmopolitan.
00:02:58
You know, there were people from all over the world because it's such an amazing city. It was very cosmopolitan and there was a lot of great weather. So when I went to school, I went to school with people from all over the world and went to school with people from Australia, from Sweden, from Denmark, you name it. So it was amazing growing up in Zimbabwe because starting off it was very capitalist. So when Mugabe came into power, he he didn't start off being a Marxist.
00:03:25
You know, it was slow walked. So it was over a 20 year period that he started implementing socialist socialist policies that then transformed Zimbabwe. But beginning there, it was amazing. You used to be called the breadbasket of Africa. Absolutely.
00:03:40
It was a very wealthy country. Even people from neighbouring countries, neighbouring African countries, used to come to Zimbabwe to migrate there for a better life. So I couldn't have asked to live in a in any other place in the world. But to grow up in Zimbabwe, it was very peaceful. You know, I used to walk to school, you know, walk back from school like miles and not have to worry about being kidnapped or anything like that.
00:04:03
It was just a beautiful, peaceful country.
00:04:06
And you have family in Zimbabwe today. Yes, I do. My mother lives there. And is your mother still lives there? Yes. And is your mother still growing up in that peaceful, beautiful country? Absolutely not.
00:04:16
Right now it has transformed into something else with the passing of President Mugabe. We now have a new president who is probably, if it's possible, worse than Mugabe as well, because he's also a serious Marxist. There's a lot of Chinese influence that has taken place in Zimbabwe. I would actually call it more like colonization by the Chinese. And it's absolutely terrible what's taking place there.
00:04:43
So when Robert Mugabe gets elected, what is his rhetoric? How are we starting? It's a great place. Everyone's happy to live here. We're called the breadbasket of Africa. I know that he started efforts, expropriation efforts. And it was what was his rhetoric? How did this begin this sort of socialist Marxist?
00:04:59
So to begin with, he was he was all about reconciliation with the white community because there is quite a significant white population in Zimbabwe. So his rhetoric started out of as reconciliation with the whites. So when I was growing up in Zimbabwe, there was no racial tension like, you know, animosity. It was all about reconciliation. Everybody moving forward away from the past of colonization, so that's how he started out. But as time went by, the corruption that he had that he had instituted within the country, the minute his ministers were stealing millions of dollars from the people and his war veterans, they blew all the pension funds.
00:05:41
So now what was taking place was the economy was starting to fail and his way of taking attention off himself was to start this Marxist rhetoric against the white farmers. So he started telling everybody that your problem is not me and my corrupt ministers. Your problem are the white farmers. They are the ones that have taken your land and this is your land. So you are the that's who you should be looking at and not me. So this is so playbook socialist.
00:06:09
It's actually the government is corrupt. The government is taking your money. But let me go ahead and start issues between the proletariat. Exactly. And the wealthy people. And that's what I start to see in the United States. And that's why it's so familiar to me. I'm just like, wow, OK, this is starting to play out again.
00:06:25
Yeah, actually. Right.
00:06:26
When you were just saying that in the beginning it was only in reconciliation need to move forward, I thought of Obama because that was sort of like that was the guy crying the night that he won, being like, finally, we're all going to come together.
00:06:38
We're going to move forward. Exactly. And not exactly what we got. Absolutely not. The same way his rhetoric started changing, Obama's rhetoric started changing and becoming more about black versus white.
00:06:49
The people of Zimbabwe fall for this rhetoric while a lot of the people in the rural areas did. So what happened was a lot of the war veterans that had lost their pension funds, they started seizing the white farmers land by force and killing some of the white farmers. So it created a lot of tension within the country, but it was mostly rural. So we never really felt it in the city. So in the rural areas that was taking place and then once once that had taken place, it started creating a cascading effect because now they were sanctions placed on Zimbabwe and it just went into overdrive.
00:07:27
So just the policies that were being implemented, you know, they all sounded great. It was like indigenization, you know, giving the land to the people. But it never really went to the people of Zimbabwe. It went to his cronies. It went to the ministers and all these. And they were building mansions that look like office buildings, you know, and they were living like that while the rest of the population was living in abject poverty.
00:07:50
I mean, unemployment went to 80 percent, if you can even imagine. I can't I can't wrap my head around that.
00:07:57
The inflation rate was it started out at seven thousand percent inflation rate and then it went to 250 million percent inflation.
00:08:07
I don't know. I can't complain. I do not have the mathematics skills to comprehend that I got an inflation rate of two hundred and fifty million, two hundred and fifty million.
00:08:19
So he comes in, he says his his cronies, he's got his ministers are doing bad stuff and people are going, hey, what's going on? And his his effort is to say, white people look at these white people, they've got your land and you've got to expropriate it and take it away from them. And of course, if you're a citizen, you're going to maybe that's it. Maybe that is the issue, trying to take this take this land away from them.
00:08:37
Except, of course, the irony of the Mugabe story is that it doesn't really work that way.
00:08:42
Expropriation effort is something that we're starting to hear a lot of that rhetoric. You know, South Africa also has this issue as well.
00:08:49
So here's the thing. Taking back farms, if you don't know how to manage a farm, those farms collapse.
00:08:55
Exactly. And that's exactly what happened in Zimbabwe.
00:08:57
Canada's, because what happened was he was giving land to people that have no background in commercial farming. You know, a lot of them was subsistence farmers. They were not commercial farmers. So he was giving them land. And then what happened was production because Zimbabwe was well known as an agricultural. You know, that was our main export was agriculture. So we're talking tobacco. We're talking flowers. You know, like Zimbabwe was providing flowers to to Europe.
00:09:24
You know, they were planes that were flying out of Zimbabwe to Europe every single day with flowers, you know, so this was what was bringing money into the country and it was creating jobs.
00:09:34
So all those things started to fall apart because what happened was those farms, you know, because they were seized, the production of of all these tobacco and flowers, and it went down by like 40, 50, 60 percent until it came to a point where, you know, Zimbabwe was not even making enough money to sustain itself and it just started to collapse and crumble. So you're looking at people who have like you know, like, for example, my mother, you know, she had invested, you know, let's say, for example, like in a 401k, she invested she had like an equivalent of what would be like, let's say, 200000 dollars.
00:10:09
And then she wakes up one morning and finds out that her two hundred thousand dollars can buy a chicken at the grocery store. And that's what we lived through. And I remember we used to sit in fuel. Cuz you would go into the supermarket and there was nothing on the shelf because Mugabe was trying to put price controls on the food, so, you know, when you put price controls, people are not going to, you know, engage in that because it let's say you you're a farmer or you sell chicken or whatever.
00:10:37
And then the government says that you're supposed to sell your chicken at five dollars, but it costs you about six dollars to make it so you're not going to put your chicken in there.
00:10:45
So we created a black market of food. So you you you had a chicken dealer. You had a bread dealer, you had.
00:10:51
Yeah. So it was crazy, irregular and at all. Yeah. Basic things.
00:10:56
You would walk into the supermarket and there was absolutely nothing on the shelves.
00:11:01
So let me ask something. When you hear now, and especially in California, I think they're leading the charge on this. We're going to put together a committee and that California is getting real close to, you know, socialism.
00:11:13
You know, we're going to put together committee to talk about reparations. Do you hear when you hear that, like government is corrupt, government is running out of other people's money.
00:11:23
And now what we're going to do is we're going to start to pretend that it's the white man's fault or it's because of 400 years of slavery.
00:11:30
And that's what it is. When I look at reparations, to me, it sounds like the land reform program that we had in Zimbabwe, you're talking about, you know, taking money from other people and giving it to other people to right or wrong from the past. And I don't believe in that. I believe in moving forward. And if you just take money, you know, let's say we're going to give you 100000 dollars, you know, from in reparations, you're going to blow through that money within a couple of years if you don't know how to invest, how to use it and whatnot.
00:12:02
So I. I don't believe in reparations. I just think it's ridiculous, because if you really think about it, who lives who, who will live today has lived through slavery.
00:12:12
Certainly not I. Who alive today has had a slave in America. Right, exactly. And when I actually studied it, I was shocked to find out that only two percent of the white people that are alive today in the United States own slaves in certain states like Kansas. You know where I'm from, Kansas City, Missouri. Kansas never had slaves. You know, there's certain states that never had slavery.
00:12:34
So it was even less than two percent at the time of the Civil War. People that actually had slaves and people don't realize that it was the extremely wealthy people. I mean, you're talking about what today would be the Jeff Bezos of the world that could afford to have slaves. And yet they see and this is even when they attack Confederate soldiers and when they need to wipe this away, those people didn't have slaves. It was a poor man's fight and a rich man's war, the civil war.
00:12:58
And and it's because of this lack of education about what this war was a fight. They weren't fighting to maintain slavery. They didn't have slaves. All these people that were fighting didn't have any slaves. Exactly. And and it's so as we're seeing increasingly now, especially with critical race theory and this focus on race, it is a bit of look over here, look over here, because we don't want you looking to see what we're actually doing over here.
00:13:22
Exactly. And we're trying to grow government and we want to get all of our cronies in there like Mugabe did.
00:13:27
And we want to take, take, take, take, take, while telling you that the reason you're suffering is because of the white man and the injustices that were done centuries ago. Exactly. It's scary.
00:13:37
It really is scary. It's scary to watch because I've lived through it. Right. I've seen it. I've seen the playbook and now I'm seeing it play out, you know, and I just listen to the Democrat Party. I'm like, I watch the show before. Oh, that is so, so scary.
00:13:50
So what was it like for your mother? I thought because I just am thinking you have two hundred thousand dollars saved in a bank account and then you wake up one day and you find out, you know, very quickly that that two hundred thousand dollars can get you chicken, maybe some eggs. What was it like for her?
00:14:05
It was very difficult. It was very difficult. But, you know, the thing is, Zimbabwean people are very resilient and they're actually very they're just naturally funny people. So there was a lot of I guess you would call the Meems now, but back then there was no Meems. But there was just a lot of jokes that surrounded, you know, people get over things with with through comedy, you know, so so there was a lot of pain that a lot of people went through, you know, just losing everything.
00:14:38
And the only thing that survived out of everything my mom had invested in was the physical real estate that she owned. And that's the only thing that survived everything. Her pension funds her for her equivalent of a 401k, her life insurance, all that stuff went away overnight. So it was very difficult.
00:15:00
So let me ask you, how did you get out? How how did you end up in America? OK, so nineteen years old country is falling apart. How did you get here so in Zimbabwe? We only have about two universities like major universities, so it's very hard to get in because you have to be a genius. And I'm smart, but I'm not a genius. So typically what happens is people who are middle class, they send their kids abroad to study.
00:15:29
So it's very typical of a middle class family to send their kids to study abroad. So a lot of people go to South Africa, they go to the United Kingdom, they go to Australia and the United States. And because I had come here before, when I was 17 for a missions trip, I went to California and Florida. What is the message trip? A mission like mission like? What do you do with your church? With my church.
00:15:52
Yeah. So I had control when I was yeah. When I was about six years old, I had come here and we went to Disney World and Disneyland. So when it came time for me to go to college, I was like, I'm going to America.
00:16:04
So so that's how it all started. And my mom at this time, all this is playing out. You know, the economy is crashing the dollar, the Zimbabwean dollars crashing against the American dollar.
00:16:18
So my mom couldn't afford to send me to the United States for school. But because my mom is a woman of faith, she said by faith, you're going to go. So she actually had like a fundraiser to raise money for my ticket, to go to them, to come to the United States. I applied to in fact, I was applying to a lot of universities on the East Coast, but it wasn't going anywhere. And almost a year, a year into applying to all these universities, I started to give up hope until this lady came up with one application.
00:16:47
She's like, just try this one. The school seems to be very responsive in my experience. We just try this last one. And it was an application to the University of Missouri, Kansas City. So I was like, I will sign it. I will do that. You know, I didn't know the difference between East Coast, West Coast or whatever. I was like, I'm going to America. I don't know the difference between the, you know, the different dynamics like Midwest versus East Coast, West Coast.
00:17:10
So I filled out that application and my mom did a fundraiser to raise money for my ticket. I got on a plane. I had one suitcase, three hundred dollars in my pocket, and I had to figure it out from there. So I arrived at you MKC. I had a partial scholarship, like an out-of-state scholarship. But then everything else I had to figure it out and I had to start working. So I was working part time. It was actually working full time at school.
00:17:38
I joined the track team as a manager in order to get another scholarship. So I was working full time on the scholarship team about 30, 40 hours and then working 30, 40 hours a week at my job studying, staying up at night. So I worked my butt off for four years and I was able to graduate with a Business Administration degree. Wow. Wow.
00:18:01
And so what what what did you say was the biggest difference in being surrounded by Africans and being surrounded about around black Americans?
00:18:11
So that's that was a bit of a culture shock for me, like just coming to the United States, because when I came, I come from a background where education is extremely important. You know, like your parents are like on you when it comes to education. It's like the number one thing, you know, when you when you do that. And it's all and it's very competitive. So in Zimbabwe, like education is a competitive sport, the way Americans are competitive with it, with sports, we're competitive with grades and stuff like that.
00:18:41
And I love it. I was actually reading your book. I was surprised when I was reading the part where you said, like, the kids who don't do well in school are the ones that are popular. Yeah. In Zimbabwe, it's the opposite. Like it's the kids who are exceed excelling in class that are the cool kids. Like if you're a teenager, you want the guy who's getting straight A's. Like, that's just how it is in Zimbabwe.
00:19:03
Yeah. And I'm just going to just add some clarity for people who are watching this that maybe didn't read my book, but I was talking about black Americans. If you do well academically, you get made fun of by other black Americans and you get accused of acting white and suddenly you're not at the cool kids or black Americans because you're not listening to hip hop music. And that's very true. And so it's the opposite dynamic.
00:19:25
So I would have been cool in Zimbabwe.
00:19:27
Yeah, you would have been you would have been one of the cool kids. So when you when you enter a school in Zimbabwe, like you take an entrance exam and that interesting entrance exam is going to determine where you what class you fall. And so there's usually like four classes. So this class A, B, C and D. So if you're if you do well in your entrance exam, you'll get into a class, you know, the ones that do the least well going to declasse.
00:19:54
So every kid's goal is to be in the class. And when you make it in the class, you're part of the club. That's that's just the way it is. And when you're in the class, it doesn't mean you have a secured spot. You have to keep your grades high, because if you don't, they will. Move you to Class B, and it's quite an embarrassment when that happens and the kids who are in B are trying to get into a race.
00:20:15
So you have to constantly competing, you're constantly competing. And then also, like when you when when you take exams during school and when when the teacher marks the exams and they put your grades, your grades are posted up for everybody to see. So when you go look for your name, you're hoping you're at the top and not at the bottom.
00:20:34
There is nothing that gets black liberals more upset with me than when I talk about the success of black immigrants from Africa academically in their careers. Professionally, I think Nigerian Americans are the most successful immigrant group. And I'm sitting here looking at this going, guys, don't tell me that's because this country's racist, right?
00:20:54
We've got some culture issues and that's why I went into that in my book, because I was like, I know how we treat intelligence, how we treat academic success amongst, you know, black Americans. And it is true that black American students fare better in an all white classroom than in an all black classroom because they're allowed to be smart, you know, and they're allowed to try and there's a competitive environment around them. Whereas for whatever reason, amongst black Americans, it's seen as a betrayal.
00:21:24
Wow. You've betrayed your culture because you're talking like the white man. You know what I mean? You're doing what the white man does. It's similar to that Smithsonian list they posted of attributes of whiteness. They called it being punctual. Did you see this? I saw people working on it, yeah. I couldn't believe it.
00:21:41
So totally different in Africa, which is fascinating. And that's why I was like, I'm just looking at the statistics. And something is obviously a different mentality in Africa. Stronger values, family values, educational values. And you come here and you're shocked to see how are you treated. Well, you know what, I was treated really well, even by by white and African-Americans, but I did see that there was a little bit of tension between Africans and African-Americans.
00:22:12
But, you know, I said, well, I was treated fairly well.
00:22:17
I mean, I I thought America was a very friendly country when I came over here, you know, like, the people are just naturally very friendly. I don't know if it's a Midwest thing, but I think it is a Midwest thing.
00:22:28
Really be OK. Yeah, I don't. New York in L.A.. Right. Right. Exactly.
00:22:33
So so. Yeah. So I absolutely loved the United States. When I came over here, there were a lot of things that were a little bit different from what I was used to. You know, I felt like people were kind of on the same level playing field, no matter what kind of socioeconomic places they came from, because in Zimbabwe we have a very distinct class system, you know, and it's very hard to move from one class to another.
00:22:55
Like if you're born poor, you're probably going to die poor. And so there's this, you know, class. I'm sure maybe your husband might know it because he's from the U.K. So the UK has a lot of that class being right in Zimbabwe, inherited that.
00:23:09
So and that's something that is actually inherently amazing about America. And Americans don't realize it is that you have you have a chance for upward mobility. It doesn't matter where you start, you can finish on top, you can move. And it's so unique about America. And because most Americans don't travel right, they they don't understand or understand how to understand it is.
00:23:27
Yes. And that is why I think you get so many immigrants coming from Africa who are like, what is wrong with you?
00:23:32
Like, I could work 10 jobs and move up a social class. I'm doing it. Right.
00:23:37
Exactly. Exactly. Absolutely. So when did you start kind of and I don't want to say getting into politics, which you really just started speaking out, you always knew you were conservative. It just aligned with your values. And that was like, this makes sense. Obviously, I'm a conservative. Right. Why don't you start moving towards deciding to be vocal about your conservative positions?
00:23:57
So I actually started I wasn't really vocal to begin with, like in the 20s around the 2014 time when the Tea Party movement was starting to get its legs. I was kind of listening to Ron Paul and I was listening to kind of like the Tea Party type conservatives. And I was like, you know what, they're right, because the Republican Party, because I did support the republic, but I started to notice that they weren't really like implementing the you know, they were a lot of talk, but no action.
00:24:26
So I started kind of getting into Tea Party politics. This is in 2014. And then when 2016 came around and we had 17 amazing Republican candidates, I was like, wow, this is the year we're going to get a real conservative. We've got conservatives and Christians running. We've got Ted Cruz. We've got, you know, Marco Rubio, we've got Ben, Dr. Ben Carson. I was like, man, this is awesome. I don't know who to pick.
00:24:52
And I was paying no attention to Trump. I was just like this clown.
00:24:56
I'll be out in no time.
00:25:00
And then it was when the first debate came with with with Trump. And do you remember Meghan Kelly's first question to him? You've called women fat pigs and she names off a whole bunch of stuff and everybody's quiet just thinking, what what is Trump going to say? Is he going to come out with, like, this politically correct thing? And then he goes, only Rosie O'Donnell was like, that's the guy.
00:25:24
That's the guy who's going to take on both establishment, the Republican Party, the Republican establishment, the Democratic establishment, and most importantly, the media. Because I understood that the media had the minds of the people. And I felt like we need somebody who is not afraid and is not intimidated by the media to be able to take that on. And from that day on, I've been on the Trump train, so.
00:25:50
Yeah. So you just started speaking out? I just started speaking out on Twitter. So I actually joined Twitter because I wanted to hear more of what President Trump. I will then. Candidate Trump. Yeah. Yeah. So then I just started tweeting my own thoughts and then, you know, I wasn't on there trying to become, you know, get followers or anything. But, you know, just as I started posting and posting content and he started retweeting you and that's exactly so.
00:26:14
So that's very, very interesting. So you are kind of just saying what you believe.
00:26:19
How many times have you been called a white supremacist, a racist, a self hating black guy?
00:26:25
And this is incredible because you're from Africa, right? Right. This is the irony. This is like the whole black liberal thing is you took us away from Africa and like you. Right. And they always try to play the like we're African card, even though they've never been to Africa. I have no idea what goes on in Africa. Probably couldn't point out on a map. But now they are all about their roots. Now you have a person perfect.
00:26:44
She's born in Zimbabwe. She lived there for 19 years. She came to this country. She worked hard. You're a racist, a racist and a white supremacist. I get that all the time and it's just shocking. I'm like, what do you mean? Like, what do you mean? So it's just ridiculous. I mean, what you're seeing I mean, you see white liberals that call me all kinds of names. I've been called all kinds of name by white liberals because they hate the fact that I don't toe the line of how they think a black person should think.
00:27:18
You know, the whole narrative that America is systematically racist country is a total contradiction to the experience that I've had living in this country, especially because the person that caused the most harm to your country is a black man, right?
00:27:30
Exactly. A black African man. A black African man. And I escaped that situation and came to this country and was able to make something of myself. Whereas if I had stayed in my country under a black president, I never would have been who I am today. Right. So it's almost like race doesn't matter. It's actually the values and the principles that people are putting into place. What a crazy, crazy idea, right? You and I share something in common, so I know what this must be.
00:27:56
Something else you get. We are both in biracial marriages, right, right now.
00:28:01
So you came to this very racist country.
00:28:03
America fell in love with a white man. Yes, right. And you have biracial children, right. So are your children half oppressed and half privileged? That's what I keep asking myself.
00:28:14
When you look at them, are you like, is that the little oppressed person in you or of a little privileged person in you? Exactly.
00:28:20
And that's that's the division that we're seeing in this nation, is, you know, when I came over here, I never pictured myself with a white person. So initially when my husband was pursuing me, I kind of thought it was weird. I was I had never, like, seen myself with with the white man.
00:28:39
But and I was actually surprised because in Zimbabwe, you know, we have white people in Zimbabwe, but white people and black people usually don't marry. If you see an interracial couple in Zimbabwe, it's usually a white person from outside the country, like from Germany or Sweden or whatever. But like white Zimbabweans and black, they don't ever intermarry. So you never, you know, like thinking of marrying somebody who's white, like, never crosses your mind, you know.
00:29:01
So when I came over here, I was surprised when, like, white guys started hitting on me.
00:29:05
I'm like, this is weird, especially in a racist country. Exactly. Absolutely.
00:29:13
So so I I met my husband like within weeks of me moving here, but it took him a year to get a date with me. So I wound up getting African women are tough.
00:29:24
I know, right.
00:29:27
So after after about a year, we went on our first date and I fell in love with him. And we've been together since we've been together for, what, 16 years now? We've been married 13 of those. And we have three kids. So it's all three kids. Yes. Isn't it interesting?
00:29:46
And I always think of this now as obviously I'm pregnant now and going on this journey. But you would think that, you know, the rhetoric that is used as America's racist and you would think that when people on the left see biracial relationships, they would look at it and say, that's what we're after, right. Where people don't see color. People love each other, not based on race. And this is beautiful. This is perfect. And yet it's the exact opposite response from these so-called WOAK liberals who claim to see racism everywhere.
00:30:14
The first thing you get called is a sellout, right? Right, exactly. I get that all the time.
00:30:20
You're a sellout if you actually invest in what the people who fought for civil rights wanted. Right. They wanted an end to miscegenation laws. They wanted to make sure blacks and whites can marry. You know, that was the loving versus Virginia Supreme Court case.
00:30:34
Exactly.
00:30:35
And yet these same people that see racism everywhere cannot see or hear it when it's coming out of their mouths.
00:30:41
Well, they want to upend all of that, right? They want to upend because we're moving further and further away from what Martin Luther King said. Right now. They say that if you don't see color, you are racist, right? I'm like, that's an inversion of reality. Like, I don't teach my kids to see color. I teach my kids to see the content of somebody's character. And that's what it should be. That's what Martin Luther King said.
00:31:05
Like, it was actually funny because my I don't talk about race with my kids because it's not an important thing. It's not about what color you are. It's not about your race is about who you really are. So it was funny because my kids, they only watch PBS because I don't let them watch a lot of garbage. But now I'm starting to be careful about that. But there was a show they came on, they said, oh, on Friday, we're going to have a family night and we're going to talk about race and racism.
00:31:31
And my kids are like, mommy, they said they're going to talk about race, what's race and racism. You know, my school, my kids, you know, he's nine years old. And I'm like, should I even start talking about this conversation? You know? So I just, you know, the whole race thing, like seeing color taught by adults to children is exactly what bothers me. And I'll add, when people say, oh, I had to sit down, I had to talk to my child about, you know, and I've seen this a few times, I saw this even if you remove race when Hillary Clinton lost and people I had to explain to my daughter, you know, that she could still be something.
00:32:04
I'm like if you if your daughter ever had her all of her hopes and futures invested in one woman, you put that energy on your daughter.
00:32:10
And I care about politics at all. When I was five years old, I would have booed, cried if Al Gore. But I didn't care about any of this. Right, exactly. It's you're putting the energy on your children. It was similar when people kept saying, how did you explain, you know, the George Floyd tape to, you know, what it was like as a black person watching this and seeing themselves? And I kept saying I didn't see myself.
00:32:30
Right. Exactly. I don't have I don't have InterAction's negative interaction with the police.
00:32:35
I've never I've never been to jail. I've never been to prison. I haven't spent multipotent. So why are you telling me that I need to see myself in every black person. Right. You're going to be like, why would I do you as a white person, see yourself in every white person, as a Hispanic person, like every Hispanic person go, I see myself in Pablo Escobar. Right. Right. And that that mindset already exists for black America, only to see ourselves every time a black person gets in trouble.
00:33:01
And that's another thing that I noticed. The difference between Africans and African-Americans is that I've noticed that African, African African-Americans, the number one thing they see themselves as is being black and that's different from any other race. Like a lot of people identify with so many things, like what they do with it, from, you know, a lot of things like that. But then the number one identifying factor I've noticed in African-American is I'm black.
00:33:25
Like, that's the number one thing. Like for me, the number one thing in my life that I identify with is my faith in Christ. So I'm a child of God.
00:33:34
Like, that's the number one thing. And then I'm a wife and then I'm a mother, you know, and then race.
00:33:39
I'm I'm black or I happen to be black so that I happen to be black. But I never thought that I had to adjust and have this entire identity and see myself and all of these other people because I only. I'm Candice, right. Exactly. And it's individual. Right. So what the left is teaching black people is to be collectivist. So it's that same narrative that collectivism. And that's and that's all. Yeah. All social is not.
00:34:02
So it's all about you need to see yourself in every single other person. And I just I'm a true free market capitalist. I believe in the individual. I believe that I don't see myself in my sisters. And I got two sisters close to the age of the first people to me. And we are so different and we make different decisions. We make different choices.
00:34:20
And I think that that's the only way forward for all Americans right now to realize the importance of individualism lest we end up like the Zimbabweans who, by the way, did the media play a big role in the Mugabe thing or was it in Zimbabwe?
00:34:37
We only have one channel on Zimbabwean channel and it's state run. So everybody knows that everything that comes out of that channel is coming directly from the mouth of the of the president. So everybody knows it's propaganda.
00:34:50
Wow. You guys don't even have a free. Not really. What about like now with YouTube and all the stuff is there. Like what? I mean, I sound so ignorant, but like, are you guys able to have like could you be Mellissa on the right in Zimbabwe?
00:35:02
Yes, I could, yeah. So we did have other channels which was mostly like cable. So it would be like American media and whatnot. But I'm saying like the Zimbabwean channel itself. Right. It would be it's just one channel. Yes. And it's state run. So everybody knows that what's coming out of there is basically propaganda. And that's why I know when I come here and I see a media I can pick up on the fact that it's it's propaganda.
00:35:25
And I feel like Americans don't really understand the fact that our media is not free press. It's propaganda for one party. So I picked that up because I, I see I saw it growing up in Zimbabwe. Just that propaganda that is constant. So it's a lot more awake to it. Yeah, absolutely. I honestly I think we just need we need more black Americans to spend time with Africans. Yes. You know, spend time in Africa.
00:35:50
I always say if I become president, I'm going to do a trade program. So every black American is like, I hate America. You took us from I mean, we're going to take you right back to you.
00:35:58
You're right. We did that. We're wrong. And we're going to put you right back to Africa and we're going to do a swap program. So for every person that's complaining about America, there's an African that can't wait to get to America. And when you die there, the opportunity there is one form America. Yes, it would. In seconds. It would. Absolutely. Absolutely.
00:36:16
You have a book coming out.
00:36:17
I want to get to this. It is called Choice. Privilege. What's it about?
00:36:21
OK, so basically the book is it says White Privilege and the white is crossed out. And I write in choice because really it's about the choices that you make, not the color of your skin that determine how well you do in life. My mother has always taught me that when you make good choices, that is what's going to determine where you go and not the color of your skin. So the book just follows kind of my experience of being black in America, but being a black African in America.
00:36:49
So the contradiction. Just basically talking about the contradiction of the whole narrative that America is systematically racist and oppressive and the contradiction of the life that that I have led, you know, coming from Africa and being black in America. So that's what my book is all about.
00:37:07
I hope people go out and buy it. I hope that your platform just gets bigger and bigger and bigger because we need more voices like yours because they really can't strip away your blackness or your identity because you lived through so much and you've seen so much.
00:37:20
Exactly. Melissa, thank you so much for coming on. We wrap every episode by allowing you to leave a two minute face message for the world.
00:37:29
So I'm going to put you in the direction of the camera and you can say whatever is on your heart and on your mind, OK, are you ready?
00:37:35
So my two minutes to the world is we have the Saniya Market segment. OK, all right. OK, on your mark.
00:37:41
Get set world. I give you Melissa Tate. Thank you. So my two minutes to the world is actually two minutes to the American people because whatever America, whatever happens in America affects the rest of the world. So I want to what I wanted to say to the American people is that you have a special country. Your country is amazing. It is great and it is exceptional. And what we're seeing today with the whole racial narrative is actually a playbook that is being played for Marxism.
00:38:09
So I wanted people to understand and recognize that this is a Marxist takeover, that they're trying to destroy the country from within. And as somebody who grew up in a country that went Marxist, I wanted to warn everybody to be able to do whatever it takes to stop what is happening. So I actually brought this. It is a 100 trillion dollar note. And this represents a country that was successful, a capitalist country that I grew up in, and I loved him in a slow walking within 20 years, this is what could have bought you a loaf of bread in Zimbabwe.
00:38:51
A hundred trillion dollars.
00:38:54
So I am employing the the American people to recognize what is taking place in this nation. I don't want America to take the same path of the place where I escaped. So I would like everybody to recognize the hour that we're in in this nation and realize that we have a choice to make the right decision and to not let America fall the way that every other socialist country has fallen. Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God and. Thank you guys for watching the latest episode of the Kandace own show, I hope you guys enjoyed the conversation as much as I did.
