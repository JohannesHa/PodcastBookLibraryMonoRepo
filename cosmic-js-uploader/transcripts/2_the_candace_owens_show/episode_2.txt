00:00:00
Too repetitive? Yeah, no, it's always relevant to me because they keep wrapping up the crazy, you know. All right, you guys tell me when you're ready. Oh, all right. OK, guys, we are rolling into another episode of the Kandace owned show, I had a thought the other day that maybe we are the most irresponsible adults in terms of how we are having the children react to certain stories. Imagine being a child today. OK, let's just take these last couple of months.
00:00:34
First, you're told by adults, the media, people around you, your parents, that climate change is going to kill you. You are going to die. You're not going to live beyond 10 years. Imagine that anxiety, but wait because it's going to get worse. Just around the corner is World War three, because we are living under an evil dictator who has inspired war with Iran. Is this responsible? Are we ramping up the crazy in society?
00:01:04
Here to discuss with me is my dear friend and author of the book, which is out now. Don't burn this book. Don't burn it, guys. Dave Rubin, welcome back to the Candesartan Show, kids.
00:01:15
I'm very happy to be here. I feel like I built candy. So, you know, I'm kind of like your Petto in this situation. Really. Stock and Amazon. Yeah. Yeah. And look at you now. Look what happened.
00:01:26
It's crazy. Crazy and it's exciting because I'm so excited. I'll be back on your show soon because I think we've sort of kind of gone through this together. Like when you when you and I first met, I was still very on the fence about a lot of topics. You know, I was sort of waking up, coming out of my spell and saying I thought I was a liberal, but maybe I'm not a liberal. And here are my ideas.
00:01:48
And I was fortunate to go on your show because you never really pushed me too hard. You feel like it's OK.
00:01:52
Come out. Well, I could see you doing it. Yeah, right. Like and that's what everyone is doing. Everyone except the truly partisan, crazy people who are trying to make us all crazy all the time. Most thinking people are actually living every day kind of trying to figure out what's true, kind of trying to figure out what's right. And by the way, not everything's political. Some people have to work. You know, they go to jobs, things like that.
00:02:14
They might have kids. You might have a dog you have to take care of or a grandparent or some other stuff, or you might have hobbies. You might want to go outside. You might want to play video games, whatever you do. And we live in this time where it's like if you don't think absolutely everything in a certain way, then a certain set of people are going to come to destroy you. Which is why I like that you started this about the kid thing, right?
00:02:36
Because imagine being a kid and, you know, you see this all the time with these people and it's usually blue check lefties on Twitter that tweet these incredible stories about what they're going through with their children. My child just came into the bedroom and said he's eight years old. And he asked me that if the Dow Jones crashes, how will that relate to the S&P mortgage, blah, blah, blah. And I said, I don't know. That's what we have to deal with in a time of Trump.
00:03:00
I love getting your kids in front of things that you're obviously saying that I'm like, this did not happen. I'm sorry your kid didn't do that. Your four year old didn't do that. It's all craziness. About three years ago, I asked my then seven year old nephew because there was this like rush of this happening on Twitter with where they're using their, you know, imaginary kids all the time. So I actually asked my seven year old nephew, he's pretty bright kid.
00:03:23
I said, what do you think of Donald Trump? I swear to God. And he looks at me and he goes, he has bad hair and he has a big red tie. That's what a kid would say. That's exactly right. It would say a kid wouldn't say, oh, his feelings on immigration are counter to the U.N. narrative on the territory. What they want to keep. It's not seen how they're using kids, which is a really twisted thing.
00:03:44
And you're right, because imagine you're a you're an eight year old kid and your parents are kind of crazy about politics because everyone's crazy about politics. And then AOC, who is an expert in absolutely nothing, comes out and says the world's going to end in twelve years unless we pass my Green New Deal, which is a complete overhaul of the U.S. economy. And it's completely insane and all that stuff. But you're eight years old now. I don't know that you're doing math at eight years old where you're like, oh, I'm going to be, you know, twenty in twelve years.
00:04:10
But to think that means in your mind, sometime in my lifetime, like the whole thing ends. Right. And it's just such alarmist lunacy and how it's like we've had these things like, like I remember we're not that old Kandace. I remember when Y2K was was happening. And I swear to you, I remember that the next day, like once midnight struck and we made it to 2000 and we were OK. I swear to you, I remember thinking to myself, I'll never fall for one of these again.
00:04:37
I'm so old. I remember when net neutrality was going to kill us. You know, net neutrality wiped out half my family.
00:04:43
I'm so sorry.
00:04:44
And the other half are now suffering from five years. I will never be the same again. I mean, and it really is.
00:04:50
You wonder why we've kind of gotten into this society. And I and I spoke to JoCo Willig about this. But the society where you're seeing more and more kids that need pills. Right. Kids that need Xanax younger to deal with the anxieties of life. And they're saying it's because, you know, life has gotten more complicated. You know, there's more pressure on them. But actually, no, it's because you're constantly putting we're putting more pressure on that.
00:05:10
Right. This is we are the problem. Right, when you have. A media and you have people that are supposed to be responsible, parents that they trust, telling them that they need to care about this, the world's going to be over. You know, for the examples where they actually did have children that were crying, I remember the same thing. My child has been crying all day because Hillary Hillary didn't win. And she doesn't think that it means that she can do anything as a young woman.
00:05:30
And I'm like, are you kidding me? If your child was so plugged in to politics and that they said that you did that right. That's trickle down emotion. You put that emphasis and that pressure on your child to believe that they had no chance at a striving to anything ever unless Hillary Clinton won.
00:05:46
I mean, I guess at some level it sounds cliche, but it really is a crisis of meaning these people that are trying to fill their lives endlessly with politics. And it's sort of funny because, like we're political creatures, although we're sort of cultural creatures also. And those things have kind of, you know, become they've morphed into one thing, which I think there's there's good in that. And there's also a bad in that. But all of these people, they don't really have meaning.
00:06:10
So every morning they wake up and then they go, what's what's the next crisis? And they go from one crisis to another. And I think one of the challenges for people like us and we both are probably good at at times and fell out at times, is how not to also ratcheted up. Right. Because you see crazy, right? You see the same people. And without even getting into some of the names, there are just some people who got Russia wrong who got, you know, all of the things that you just listed wrong.
00:06:36
And it's like you see them tweet out some other crazy thing and it's like you want to destroy them. But then I also don't want to endlessly be adding to the chaos. And I think that also is a bit of a challenge for the people that are somewhat sane throughout this. Like you want to take out bad ideas, but sometimes if you become so obsessed with that, you start becoming what you hate. You. I mean, you you gaze into that thing for too long and you'll become it.
00:07:01
So I've survived enough apocalypses.
00:07:03
And then even when I have no policies on the title for your next book, I survived. And I know from the science they should study me.
00:07:10
Right. It's incredible. I've lived through all how you did these apocalypses and gamma radiation. I must have good, good genes. Yeah. And so I do it and I almost feel like I add my voice. I don't I still don't consider myself to be a political figure. I consider myself to be an anti political figure because I think that everything is being politicized and I try to just be rational and say, like, calm down, calm down, everybody just relax, because I do kind of worry that we're creating these kids.
00:07:37
They're just not they're literally going to be freaking out. They already have life stress. They don't seem to think that they're going to die. You know, every two weeks we need to be more responsible.
00:07:45
And it's interesting to see how you talk about this transition of how politicians are now using kids, because there's this remarkable moment that I haven't gotten to discuss yet, but know put people to death is no longer in the race. But when he was running, he had a town hall. They all had.
00:07:59
Yes, the moment where a fourth grader, he magically plucked the question, by the way, this was by chance.
00:08:05
That was incredible.
00:08:06
What are what is going to happen this year? And I just happened to be, you know, a gay kid asking it, saying, you know, I also am gay and, you know, how should I come out in the gay? I guess the fourth grader. The fourth grader.
00:08:18
Why should I come out right now? You know, you do this on CNN. Yeah. Yep. He wanted to do it that way. And I said, this is this isn't real. This is this isn't real.
00:08:26
This is using a kid to score some political points, to give some answer that you already have plans that's supposed to make people that are gay, lesbian, bi and trans vote for you in that moment really bugged me.
00:08:37
Well, everything feels staged at the moment. Right. And I think that really is Trump's greatest gift, that for Trump, a guy who's orange with this crazy hair and has strange intonation and inflection when he speaks, that he is more real than all of these people. That is an incredible, incredible thing. So when they stage these things and the kid comes out there and gives a sort of packaged answer, it's because they're still trying to trick us whatever is left of mainstream.
00:09:05
And there isn't much left of it. And I think actually one of the biggest problems we have right now is there's basically a truth divide. And then on top of that, they do these these prepackaged, rehearsed, ridiculously stiff and inauthentic things like having this kid get up there. And also, I mean, I don't know how far you want to go into it. I mean, having a fourth grader talk about his sexuality on stage with a presidential candidate is also bizarre.
00:09:29
And let's also not forget that the real radical leftist, they were pissed at Pete the entire time because he's not gay enough for them. Right. He's gay, meaning he is married to a man, but he doesn't identify as queer meaning except the entire intersectional outlook of life package. I happen to appreciate that. I don't I don't really like Pete Persay. And I think you know this. We were going to have Pete on my show. His comms team had agreed to it via Twitter and we started emailing and then Vox and Huff Po and Media Matters all started going after him.
00:10:00
And next thing you know, they they stopped responding to our immediate people, worked out for him, didn't work.
00:10:04
Yeah. And you know what? It's not that. But that's the point, because I knew it's like now I don't know that Pete had a decision of we're not going to do Rubner work as media. Was going to first, but it tells you about the type of people he hires, he tells you about a bunch of people who operate that, oh, we do. Out of the mob.
00:10:22
This is the person that you need to be if you're going to get to the next the next spot. And the funny thing is, it hasn't worked for them. Pretty hasn't worked for them. So, like, they're actually they should have learned my lesson since 2016 that manufacturing a personality doesn't actually work. Being authentic carries you further. I mean, you know, on the on the other side of the coin, you have Trump who won in 2016 and he won Infowars, which is like supposed to be, you know, the fringe.
00:10:45
Horrible. If you go on this, your life is over thing. He on 2016 went on Infowars and spoke with Alex Jones. He's in the United States. So you would think that just in retro assessment, people would say, you know what, I'm just gonna be authentic and talk to people. I'm going to say what I believe everywhere. Doesn't matter who I'm speaking to. You shouldn't be nervous to say if you are who you are and you're not going to suddenly adopt all of my views because you're on the show and showing I'm going to I'm not going to adopt all of your views because I'm on the report.
00:11:09
Yeah, it's OK. It's OK. You're not going to adopt my views. And I don't think unless here's and here's the big question. You're not going to marry a gay dude. This come on.
00:11:16
I mean, I don't know. I don't know. But here's the big question.
00:11:19
Are you still a liberal here? This is the big question. And I'm pushing you on this for years because I just don't see.
00:11:26
Yes. So last time I was in here, this is how we started the conversation. And what I said to you is I am now trying to conserve because you're a good conservative. I am trying to conserve liberalism. And I think for most of you conservatives, for all of you guys, you want same liberals, right? You don't want you know, Jordan Peterson talks about this a lot, that you want a healthy tension between the two sides, whether that's right or left, Democrat or Republican, authoritarian versus libertarian.
00:11:53
You want tension in a free society. You want some tension just to make sure that neither side goes off the deep end. You just want that. Look, there is no piece of me that can say with a straight face that when when most people say liberal, they're not talking about me, they're talking about leftists. And I know we've done this many times. Right. I would say this and this is this is my true challenge. And this is partly what the book is about, is that for conservatives, if you guys can carve out a little space for some people that you disagree with.
00:12:25
So, you know, my you know, I'm pro-choice, but very begrudgingly. And actually in the book, I now say it's first trimester and then only with minor, minor exceptions. Beyond that, I do concede that I actually do think it is killing a life. I do believe that is a life. Well, that's that actually is part of the thing.
00:12:41
I think if more liberals could concede that it was actually a life, that that's the point. It's pretending it's not a life and then and then glorifying, then glorifying. Well, I guess that's the problem. You know, I've debated this topic with Dennis Prager on my show and with Shapiro and many other people. And one of the thing that always comes up is that these guys can make pretty sound arguments. And if you're if your argument starts with that, conception is life.
00:13:02
Well, it's tough for a pro-choice person to argue with that because. Right. It's like if we found a speck of anything on the moon, you know, a cell, we'd say it's life. So I can I can make that concession. What I find interesting, though, it's not really the pro-life arguments. And you and I have debated this over dinner. Right. So it's not really the pro-life arguments that actually have pushed me, let's say more right on this.
00:13:23
It's actually the hysteria of the left. It's the obsession with making it this fetishized, glorified thing.
00:13:32
You mean you didn't find it sexy when when Miley Cyrus got half naked and put her tongue out and said, you know, abortion is something and was happy about it? You didn't find it moving when when Michelle Williams gave that speech talking about how she had to kill her baby in order to get that trophy.
00:13:47
Yeah, well, what was the one that was even worse? That washup up actress recently, a blonde woman. And she's screaming that basically her whole career, which didn't even turn out that great was due to her abortion threesome, can't even remember. But remember her name like it's some random actress.
00:14:00
But but because of their unhinged attitudes towards this, it's not that someone else's attitude can change what I fundamentally believe. But there is a sort of reality to politics that you go, all right, if I've got all of this craziness over here and a set of ideas that I maybe disagree with, but it's it's rooted in something real. It's rooted in individual rights and everything else, well, then you will actually gravitate one way. So to answer your question, which was am I still a liberal?
00:14:28
I would say if if the white tent of conservatism can accept some ideas that are a little more libertarian, you know, you don't have to agree on everything. But if they want that purity test of you got to agree with us on absolutely everything to be in this thing, then then no. But I would say by any estimation in that I am trying to conserve something that I think the founders were trying to conserve, that I think that I think the last remaining liberals, whoever they are, you know, we're in a little bit of a Jedi after order 66 situation.
00:14:55
They've just been slaughtered across the galaxy. That's a great reference for your husband. Even if it's slightly going over your head, we're in that situation. So I don't know that it matters that much. What I can tell you is that we need to be like that for my listeners need to know.
00:15:08
Listen, I would say this. I like conservatives. I like hanging out with conservatives. I like. Debating conservatives, I never find a rude conservative, it's almost impossible to find I get nothing but love from conservatives. I spoke, you know this I spoke at Liberty University, the largest evangelical Christian conservative Christian college in America. I spoke in front of 14000 people. You've done the exact same gig. These people know my views. They know I'm married to a man.
00:15:33
I got a standing ovation. They couldn't have been nicer. I wandered around campus for a couple hours. People coming up to me saying all sorts of nice things. By the way, some people did come up to me and say, you know, I'm praying for you. And I don't know if they meant that I'm praying for you, meaning I'm trying to pray the gay away or I'm just praying like your continued success or whatever. But it would almost be irrelevant to me, even if someone if someone praying the gay away.
00:15:53
Well, that's not offensive. It's they're not saying I'm going to call me over the head, over the head to put you put you somewhere you shouldn't be. I'm I'm praying for you. And by the way, I can deal with that. Someone that comes up to you with a smile on their face and says a bunch of nice things and I'm praying for you. That's actually a lot nicer than than a progressive who will scream all day how much they love gay people and then will unleash endless hate on me because I don't bow to them.
00:16:18
So, you know, this is where this idea of tolerance and all of these things, I think I think broadly speaking, conservatives have done a really nice job in the last couple of years of cleaning up whatever those bad parts are. The point is that conservatives still often, I think, should take a libertarian approach on it, be OK with a state by state situation. But there's still a certain layer of conservatives that take a sort of more moral position, you know, and that it's going to infect society.
00:16:46
And by the way, I'm not trying to change those people's opinions.
00:16:48
That's the part that I really want to tell you, that I'm not here to do change that. Yeah, yeah. It's funny. I just want to carve I'm on the same side. I agree with that. And I actually had debate with Rick Santorum, actually. So it's so random. We happen to be on a trip together with like 20 people. And we were fishing and I was sitting next to him at dinner and he really went on this rant about smoking pot.
00:17:08
I don't smoke pot. It's not for me. It's not something that I do. It's not something I think people should do. I think it makes people lazy and unambitious. But I also am logical. Right? So he's sitting next to me and mind you, he has a glass of wine, he's drinking. And he says, you know, this is the thing that people should never do. And I say to him instantly, I say, have you ever smoked pot?
00:17:26
And he says, no. And what's interesting about that is that people that have never smoked pot think it's equivalent to methamphetamine. So they think that people get all, you know, jumped up and go commit crimes. Yeah, a lot of people get stoned and rob a bank. Yeah. And that's like the opposite. They usually sit on their couch and eat a bag of chips and become extremely lazy and don't do anything and are laughing and giggling or something, you know, irrelevant.
00:17:44
And so that's part of the problem is that, you know, you're you you've never smoked pot in your view point to people that smoke pot is wrong. And this, by the way, again on a Friday.
00:17:52
And I agree that I actually do think people should smoke pot, just my opinion. But I'm looking I'm drinking the wine. I said, well, in terms of degeneracy in society, what what do you think has done more harm? People that drink? I just can't reconcile how you're drinking wine. And you know me. I at that point when I met him, I wasn't drinking. I don't drink now. It's just like, you know, I go into a phase where I just I don't drink.
00:18:11
And I said, so how do you reconcile? You know, how are you a puritan on that and not on alcohol, which, by the way, you want to talk about people that have been abused because of alcohol. People have been killed because of alcohol, people that die from people whose families have to go through their parents having having alcoholism. I'm like, how do you reconcile that? That's a drug? And he said, no, it's not.
00:18:31
Yeah. And so I said, this is where can sort of get into trouble. Right? I said, because you can't at the same time be consuming alcohol, which we know has ruined so many people's lives, has killed people behind the wheel. But say to other people that if they are smoking, you know, a little bit of pot in their bedroom, that they're evil. And you just you have to be more careful on that because it makes you look hypocritical.
00:18:52
So I think you're obviously completely right. And by the way, what you did there by actually saying that to his face and not like just because you didn't wait, you didn't wait. This is what in 20/20, what would someone really do? It's like, oh, you'd have that. You'd do it. You'd see him drinking the wine. You're hearing what he says about weed. You wouldn't say anything. But then you'd go on Twitter the next day and be like, I was fishing with Rick Santorum and, you know, so it's great what you did, right?
00:19:13
Because that's what it is. That's how you can actually change people. You sit two feet away from them and and you do this. Of course, I agree with your premise there. Now, I'm again, I'm not trying to make all conservatives believe that. But what I want conservatives to sort of come around to is, oh, we can have a couple people in this thing, whatever this is. And by the way, it's happening. And it's not like you guys give out laminated cards, do you?
00:19:38
And there's no lemonade dance, right? Yeah.
00:19:40
So so maybe this has already happened already. I actually suspect it has, because the amount of people that come up to me that say they, you know, they don't care about gay marriage or they're gay, married or whatever, but they were they were once lefties and now basically consider themselves conservative. You know, it's also that the word I think is a little bit tainted, but it's not a fun word word. It's not a conservative. Right.
00:20:03
So both of the right oh, liberal by liberals, all the words have become so tainted now that like. But that's but that was really why I wrote the book because. Was the idea is, think for yourself, you don't if there if there are ten important issues, there's obviously more than that. But if there are ten important issues, if you and I agree on six of them and two of them, we're kind of still figuring out and two of them we absolutely disagree on.
00:20:26
Well, Candice, I still want to live in the same country as you, and I still want to be your friend. And that's the thing that everyone is just getting rid of.
00:20:33
Right. And I am so happy to talk about that because I totally agree with you that the Puritan conservatism doesn't work. And I think that I've actually tried to get rid of that and I've dealt with it a lot. I mean, you saw me literally I feel like I've grown up politically in front of everybody.
00:20:47
And I think more than anybody, maybe even more than me, because at least when I started, I was starting from like a political base. Right. Like I was on the left. I was on the Young Turks. I was a progressive. And then I started waking up. But my base was kind of political. I was a political science major. I always cared about this. That first time you walked into my studio, as you said before, like you were kind of totally figuring it out.
00:21:10
I was open. I was open to listening. And and I and I never wanted to be the person that pretended to be someone that I wasn't. If I wasn't comfortable answering a question, I would say, you know, this is my feeling on it, but I don't really know much about it. So that's it. Yeah. And it was great. Honest, I always tell people that was such a good moment for me to be on your show because you were so accepting of that.
00:21:27
You were like, you don't need to commit to this or this and have an answer right now. And I actually ironically had the opposite experience. I want Joe Rogan where I was like, I don't I feel like there's something more I don't trust the climate change seems like I need to pick him or be agnostic. And and I was like I just my feeling is that it's not right because I was told I was going to die when I was in high school, you know, climate change.
00:21:43
And I'm still here, but I haven't researched just because you're a server, right? I haven't researched it. And I felt like he wanted me to pick one camp or the other. And so what I try to do, even in being a conservative, is be more open and especially on the pro-choice stuff, because I say to people, my friends have gotten abortions. People that I've grown up with have gotten abortions. And I know if they didn't go to the abortion clinic saying, I want to kill a baby, in fact, I know what they learned in school, that it was a clump of cells.
00:22:06
Right. So how can you that we have to be warmer in saying how about saying, you know, what if you got even if you got an abortion, you can still be pro-life. And that is a stance that I take because it's less black and white. It's less you kill the baby, you're a murderer. That doesn't work. That's the same kind of stuff the left does on the other side. If I believe in my position and I do that, then it's a life.
00:22:26
How about saying to them, I know that you can it can be very confusing when you're young and you're told that your whole life is going to get ruined if you get pregnant. It's just a clump of cells and you can make a decision, but you can change your mind.
00:22:36
There's so much there. So so first off, partly why the left is always screaming is they don't know really what their starting point is. So so people on the right, generally, if you're if you're an American, you believe in individual rights. You believe that every single person, regardless of their skin color or sexuality or gender, blah, blah, blah, should have the same exact rights on the left. You sort of have this idea that the state is kind of supposed to do a lot of stuff and then the disagreement is how much it should do.
00:23:04
So the best way I can explain this is if you think back to the 2016 election, it was like if you picture, you know, Marco and Cruz and Trump all up there, they didn't have massive substantive issues. They had issues about personality. Right. So Trump is your little Marco and you're lying, Ted, and you're this one. And Bob. But they didn't. But they sort of all believe in the Constitution. They all believe that America is fundamentally good.
00:23:27
And the rest of it, if you look at where the Democrats have been for the last couple of years, it's like they kind of don't really believe in the Constitution all the time. They kind of tell you that they never say words like freedom and liberty. Imagine if someone walked on stage at one of those things and said the word freedom. People would be like, you're at the wrong of anybody. What are you talking about here? But I think that gets to why they're so hysterical all the time, because they have this idea that the state is supposed to do a lot and then the next guy is like, no, the state should do more.
00:23:55
And then you're kind of like, oh, maybe it should. Otherwise I'm a bad guy. So it's like when they say they're for fifteen dollars minimum wage and then Rasheeda Talib comes along, that's, you know, Bernie's been pushing fifteen forever, which is a horrible idea on so many levels and and antithetical to American ideas, because why should the government be able to force a private company what to do and put that aside. But then Rasheeda comes along, she's like, no, it should be twenty.
00:24:16
And it's like, well, she's kind of right because you just made up a number. So why not make up another night and then somebody is going to come along and you're racist. It's twenty five, you know, so it's like so they don't know what their fundamental principle is. And because of that. Because of that. That's why they're crazy all the time. Because constantly you're looking around going who's going to outdo me on something. And I think that's a fundamental piece of why having a debate about abortion, which I've tried to do a million times, Lila Rose, who you've had her on on this show.
00:24:45
Right. So she's been on my show. I think she's wonderful. Obviously, we have some disagreements on this stuff. I have put out there many times on Twitter. I would love to have a pro-choice advocate come on the show with Lila Rose. We've invited Alyssa Milano and the collection of of usual suspects. Totally, respectfully. We've reached out publicly and privately. Nobody, nobody. And there's a reason for it.
00:25:07
It's not just the Dave Rubin, it's me or something like that or that Lilo's A or something like that. Not true statements, obviously, it's that they don't want to actually debate these things in a calm way because they need the emotion to override the argument, because they because they don't believe what they actually believe. And I say that all they know what they believe. I will always tell you if somebody on the left, if they're genuine and they believe what they believe, I actually have respect for that.
00:25:31
They actually believe these things can work and they believe it. Then they'll come and they'll speak to you. Case in point, Russell Brand, Russell Russell Brand is hilarious, but he believes what he says enough that he will have people on the other side and say, let's have a conversation and get to. And you guys had an amazing discussion because I knew that just because he wanted he would be in the room if he was willing to come into the room.
00:25:48
I knew that that meant that he actually believed it. Right. And we were going to have it back forth. And I can't say the same for anybody else. The only person that I came close to having in the room that says these these things on the last was Djamila Jalil Jalil, Genealogically Hill, Jameela Jamil. I think that is how you say her name. And so she is an actress on some NBC show called The Good Police. Have never seen it.
00:26:10
Never heard about her. She literally the only reason I engage she figured out who she was, is because she was attacking Ali Stucky, who I deeply respect about. She basically she tweeted, I'm so happy I abortion like I do it again and again. She was one of those, like, proud, like abortions.
00:26:25
And I think it really is just disgusting. And I said something to her and then we got into it and she said, oh, and I said, you're going to say all this on Twitter, but you would never, ever have a conversation with me on my show. And then she said, well, you can come on my podcast. I have a conversation. And I said, game.
00:26:38
And I knew instantly as soon as I made the offer, I said, she will go out of this before this happened. She got it and she tried. She inbox me first and literally tried to insult me and said the nastiest things to me. And I held the line in issue one insult because I wasn't going to give her the wiggle room that she wanted for me to attack her on anything. And then she ended up canceling because I tweeted after some insane article headline that was on maybe it was on Daily Mail, who knows?
00:27:03
But it said like but like a trans man gives birth to a person's trans, whatever it was the most.
00:27:12
I couldn't even figure it out. I was like a map. And I said, only woman no woman gave birth but will read the headline. This article should just be woman gave birth rate. I tweeted that and then she wrote that she was canceling the show. She blocked me because her trans employer, employees that work with our trans colleagues don't feel safe because they would feel unsafe if I walked into the room because I tweeted, only women can give birth.
00:27:34
See, and this is the exact I mean, so there's so much that. Right. So first off, just the tactics, right. You knew she was going to cancel before it even happened. And of course it did, because she didn't really want to have the conversation. So she just had to figure out a way to go, oh, this is the line that you crossed and I was going to do it yesterday. But new information has come across my desk and it turns out you're more evil than even I thought.
00:27:55
OK, so that's that's the first part of it. The second part is that it's like when they when they do all of this stuff to make everything feel phobic, it's all phobic that you have phobia is an irrational fear. Now, I suspect, Candice, that if a trans person walked into this room, you wouldn't have any.
00:28:13
Yeah, you'd be OK with it. A you you may not even know. Right. But you may know and I know you like I know you and I know you would be totally respectful of them as long as they were respectful of you and you would want to engage perhaps in an interesting conversation about it. But this actually brings me to something that I've only told this story once, and it was very brief. So basically no one has heard this.
00:28:34
But back in December, I was speaking a turning point student action summit, which you spoke at as well. And Trump Junior was there and he asked if he had done my show. And we become kind of friendly. And now we're all in these weird circles. Right. Like, it's it's very bizarre that we're all like, oh, I know this one. This one knows this one. It's kind of whatever. And he said, would you would you and David like to join Kimberly and I dinner tonight?
00:28:57
I was like, sure. It's like, all right, Marla. It is. I was like, oh, that'll that'll be something. So we go to Largo and I walk in and there's Candice Owens and she's having dinner there with her husband and some friends. And it's a really interesting place. And, you know, there's so there's these two rooms. And I'd say the first room is maybe, I don't know, sixty people or so having dinner.
00:29:16
And then there's this other room and we were in there and it's just the four of us. And one table over is the president. He's sitting there with Giuliani and the first lady and a couple other people. And we have a great dinner. And just I like Junior. He's just he's straight up. He's just he is what he is. Right. And then at the end of the dinner, he says, would you like to meet my dad?
00:29:34
And I was like, oh, yeah, I guess so. Meet the president. Why not?
00:29:36
You know, like, no, you know, I'm pretty tired that I just got to get out of here. I mean, I'm a YouTube video, so so we walk up to him and Trump sitting down and this is like two or three days after after impeachment had been announced. And every article was Trump's freaking out. The walls are closing in. Meanwhile, he's sitting there, his ties off. He looks totally relaxed when you see him up close.
00:29:57
His hair is it's even more fluffy and crazy than you think, that you're just like, what is that? But anyway, he's sitting and I'm standing there and Junior says he says, Dad, I want you to meet Dave Rubin. He's got this great podcast. And he looks at me and he goes, I kind of recognize you. And I was like, Oh, well, I'm on Tucker a lot. And you go. And then he turns to Dave.
00:30:12
But my husband and he goes, and who are you? And David goes, Well, I'm his husband and this is exactly what Trump did. He goes, Husband, husband. I want to get up and shake both your hands. He stands up. He shakes both our hands. He says he's like, thank you guys so much for for being here. And your friend Don. That's just great. That's great. And then Melania. Well, and then he goes he goes, I want you guys to know one thing.
00:30:35
I don't give a shit. And I don't think anyone else is giving a shit for 20 years. I want you to really know that. Then then Melania and David started chatting and Junior got pulled away. And I had about ten minutes with Trump and I told them some political theories that I have and a bunch of stuff. And the guy couldn't have been nicer. And I actually said to him at first, I said, it's an honor to meet you, Mr.
00:30:52
President. And I know when I said it, I could have said to him, Hey, Don, what's up? Like, he could not have cared less about that stuff. But anyway, I mention this related to phobia because they'll tell you that Trump is a homophobe. He's a homophobe. Well, I saw a moment of him that was absolutely real. So if he's if he's a phobe, if he's has an irrational fear of gay people, he's really not doing it well.
00:31:17
But this is what they do with everything. Right.
00:31:18
And they they put these labels on people and and usually doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Like, it doesn't make any sense. I mean, he went in in support of gay marriage. It doesn't make sense to say that he's a homophobe. Right. There wasn't a guy that was saying what he had to say to get elected.
00:31:31
But everybody does, right? Well, exactly. But it does make sense if your only goal is to stifle the opposition, if your goal is not to engage, well, then it makes perfect sense because you can shut down a lot of people. You know, I've told you this, maybe we've said this on air, but I've told you this privately for sure that I get crap sometimes when you tweet from my, you know, my nice liberals, many of them who have been on my show, the nice guys, you can probably run through your Rolodex and figure out a few.
00:31:53
I won't throw them under the bus right here, but I get crap when you say something and people say, Dave, you said you better say something to Candace about that or Dave, Kansas is going overboard, blah, blah, blah. And it's like I find it. It's disgusting. It's actually disgusting. A as if I own you or control you or would even want to exert any influence that I might have with you or something like that.
00:32:14
But it's also like this is unfortunately what leftists do. It's like there's so much that they probably like about you. But when you do a little something that they don't like or a little tactic or because because you are a little more combative, let's say, or you were I think you are a little bit less now, that's not the way that because they want to go to nice parties and they want to be invited to the right thing so they can't be too closely associated with you.
00:32:35
So it's like you'll do the dirty work for them. And now I feel like I'm in that position, too. I'm doing the dirty work for a lot of you guys. You well, you guys have all kind of become irrelevant right now. That might have been a little harsh, but. But it's true.
00:32:47
And unfortunately, they you shouldn't be combative. You shouldn't say. But the truth is the truth. Right. So it's combative to say. It's considered combative to say only women can get birth. I mean, that's society. That's right. Right. So even if you're looking at what they're weighing against, what makes Canice Owens combative. Right. Am I just going down fighting random women and being like f you you're this guy, right?
00:33:05
I mean, like that would be like this person is completely crazy. It's not nice. It's mean and it's combative. Right. To issue a statement that only women can get birth it that's not combative. That's the truth. Right. And consider the truth to be combative. But they're OK with lies, right. Civilization. I'm sure they will never text you and say maybe you should tell Alyssa Milano that the the red hat is not the KKK hat.
00:33:29
That's not considered a bad tweet that. Oh, that's that's rational. Applaud that. That's great. She says she's using the history of black Americans a very real history so that she can make herself so she can vote single by saying that she doesn't like. That's all fine. If Candice tweets back at her and says how ridiculous it is because the people that lived through the real Ku Klux Klan are still breathing like my grandfather, that's combative. So you know what she deserves Alyssa Milano blocking her, which is exactly what happened.
00:33:52
Right. You care so much about black people that you block them when they tell you that what you said about them is offensive to their to their to the people that are still breathing that let's do it. So this is the world we're in but can't.
00:34:02
They're morally right. Right.
00:34:05
That's right. I would sad if they're morally right. So, you know, it's factually incorrect, right? I mean, she said she literally said that you don't have to be factually right. You have to be morally correct.
00:34:17
You know, we're slightly morally correct to use the history of black Americans to further your political points. Right. And that's what it's come in. And that's that is and Dennis Prager says this the whole time, that is the worst sin about beliefs that they cheapen evil. So, yeah, people like me that are combating lies. So we have to be combative because it's a lie and it should be smacked down, because if people start accepting the sort of rhetoric and people start really believing that we're littering, we're living under the reign of Adolf Hitler and no one's going to say something to to knock that back if we really believe that we're living in a time similar akin to slavery and no one's going to knock that back for black Americans, that that that's that's not OK.
00:34:54
But what's interesting is not everybody, whatever it is about you, let's say that, like, gives you the fire to like when you woke up to just be like, I'm running with this. Right. I am going to be myself. I'm going to fight for everything. I believe I'm going to fight celebrities and politicians. Like I'm going to challenge people. I'm going to go to Congress. I was with you that evening after you. You mopped up over there and it was it was unbelievable, like you just take no prisoners, but a lot of people don't have that within them.
00:35:20
And I think showing people you have to model it for them, that you can escape. And I think that that's why the amount of hate that we get is particularly high. I happen to be a big damn deal. I would prefer actually, if it never really came up. But, you know, because we talk about things through the lens of identity politics that they've handed us, sometimes it's you have to bring it up, right. As an interviewer, something comes up or it would be great for me to sit with you for an hour and not have to say anything about blackness per say.
00:35:51
Yet we have to fight something, but they really don't want us to walk. You can't just. What are you talking about? Candice is just going to, you know, walk away from the Democrats, a black woman. You think she's just going to escape? A gay guy is just going to escape. And what they fear is not the two of us specifically. It's that we're modeling behavior on how other people can escape. Right. And all we're really doing, it's not that we set out to do that.
00:36:14
Right. We didn't sit there with a guidebook like how do you get the hell out of here and what are we going to do? And everything is just that you started thinking for yourself, right?
00:36:20
I mean, what it comes down to is that sexuality, race, these are attributes. These are not they should not define your character. And this is what the left gets wrong all the time. Right. Like me, being black does not define my character that you should not know what I think, because the color of my skin, how you say twisted should not define your character. I should not say instantly whether I should know. Oh, I know everything about this guy and what he thinks because he's married to a man that's crazy and it's a progressive tax.
00:36:44
It's like it makes exactly for progressive tax. Yeah, right. He must there thereby assigned other all the socialist policies like and unfortunately, because they've allowed these things to become identifying things, not just attributes, not just all you know, I'm I'm five foot seven. I'm black. I'm female right now. They want to turn into you are female. Therefore it's it's a character thing. It defines everything about you. It means that you have to think this way.
00:37:10
But by the way, must be a feminist because you are a female white.
00:37:14
But also there's so many reasons it doesn't make sense. So you see this all the time. This just happened over the last couple of weeks on The View. Meghan McCain is talking about how you shouldn't just vote for someone because they're a woman, which is, of course, the correct position. That would be like saying just vote for someone because they're a man. It just doesn't make sense. And then, Joy, they are saying, no, you should vote for women, vote, vote for women.
00:37:35
And then Meghan basically was like, all right, well, maybe I'll run. Will you vote for me? Joy enjoys like it's like, man, the level of hypocrisy here is crazy. Of course. Of course, Joy shouldn't just vote for her as a woman. But it's like you don't mean vote for women. You mean for vote for women who behave the way they do. You want them to behave. And that is so it's so dangerous.
00:37:55
And by the way, I mean, you see the end of this constantly, right? So Corey Booker pulls out of the of the election because he's getting no support. Nobody really likes him. That's just kind of how it is. He comes off as this sort of neither here nor there. Corporate is something whatever. What is what does he immediately do? It's because of racism or Elizabeth Warren doesn't get really any support except the media loves her because she's this sort of librarian that whatever.
00:38:19
I don't know what the bill is, you know, the Native American librarian. So whatever it is. But but then what happens? It's because they're they're sexist. But what they're saying is they're not saying that we're all sexist. They're saying their own base is sexist and racist. Who voted in Democratic primaries? White Democrats. Right. Right. So so it's not just they turn it on all of us, you evil conservatives and libertarians and people on the right Republicans.
00:38:41
It's not just that you're all a bunch of sexist and racist. They end up because because it is so ideologically inconsistent, they end up turning it on themselves at the end. So Booker has to say at the end, there's no diversity up there. I was the black guy. Your racist Warren has to say it's just too old white guy.
00:38:58
Obama, by the way, let's not think about the until we have to forget Barack Obama. Forget him. But it's because of the racism. And that's exactly right. And it and it really it really goes back to the thesis that at the end they left always each their own because they have to they have to eat their own because it's the only way it works. Let the leftism only works if it eventually can come back and kill you somehow. And that was the beautiful thing that you saw, despite the fact that going back to Jameela Jamil that she canceled me two weeks later, she got eaten by her own.
00:39:21
You know, I well, she she she's an actress. And she was going to I guess that she was going to play a part and she was going to play a trans person. Oh, right. Right.
00:39:29
You know, actors are no longer allowed to act. No, no. You took the part away from the queer person because she was playing the part. You want to know what Jamila did when they were eating her and they were all saying how wrong it was.
00:39:40
She came out as queer. Oh, right, right, right. She's now queer. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's about my getting in trouble for acting. Never mind. I'm crap and quit my whole life and they were like, are you kidding me. She's like, no, I've always been queer. This is the lunacy now where it's like you actors literally acting, acting. So let's just be clear. When you act, you're basically just pretending to do something so you're not this.
00:40:02
Right? So it is. So if you're a nuclear scientist, let's say in a movie, you're probably not one in real life. You're pretending Leonardo DiCaprio did not actually die in the Titanic in 1914.
00:40:12
Did you know that? Leonardo DiCaprio did not actually die. News to me. He was acting that way. So Tom Hanks wasn't stuck on that island. He wasn't stuck on the island. This is never wrong.
00:40:20
But they're actors. And by the way, actors, you know, I say this is you know, I came out of the stand up world and I took a couple acting classes back in the day. Actors are the worst people there are. Actors are the most self-absorbed.
00:40:34
It was a running joke because I would take I would take a few acting classes. I only did it for about a year, but I did it with comics and comics for all the neuroses and weirdness around comics and perhaps ego stuff and all that stuff. I'm not denying any of that. But comics like usually you go into comedy because you've got something to say. You're trying to like get to something true somewhere and you use comedy to do it right.
00:40:54
But actors for the most part just want to be looked at. And then suddenly we take these people who just want to be looked at. And because Chris Evans and Mark Ruffalo are Bernie brainwashed buffoons, they can say whatever they want now. And you can still be pretty successful in Hollywood and be in The Avengers as opposed to maybe somebody on the right in Hollywood who might dare say what they think. And then, you know, you're out, which is why, you know, I've had Adam Carolla on and he has said many times, you know, if if someone's in Hollywood and you don't know what they think, they're conservative.
00:41:25
So it's like, that's exactly right. I don't know I don't know what Seinfeld thinks about anything. Right. But I mean, it's gotten to a point. And that's why I say it's like there's no way they can win. Right. And they're starting to see that where you have to start pretending to be queer, you're not allowed to act like you're going to be something. If I was pretending, I mean, like, seriously, I've been with David for ten years.
00:41:42
I tell them, tell me in what scenario you can survive when you can't even do your job because it's seen as offensive, because you're taking the part from a real queer person who should have been able to act like, I mean, that we have officially reached peak lunacy.
00:41:55
And this is why it goes back to the death of comedy, right. When they're getting in trouble, because they're telling jokes. Comedians are often telling jokes, actors and actors are in trouble for acting who is going to survive this apocalypse? Life is about none of you, which is why we're getting more people that are saying maybe I'm not as far as I thought I was, because it turns out that I can't survive it. So if you didn't get hit by the ME2 storm, you didn't get hit by the hurricane of your actors aren't allowed to get hit by the hurricane.
00:42:21
Comedians can no longer tell jokes like where who is left standing?
00:42:25
Well, remember that beautiful one where that Mark Duplass, who is a Hollywood director and actor, and he all he did was tweet out that basically in effect, he said, Ben Shapiro, I disagree with you on some stuff, but he's not a terrible human. I mean, he tweets is not a terrible human. Yes, that was it. That was that was basically it. And mob went bananas. He had to delete the tweet, had to issue an apology.
00:42:47
It wasn't just a Twitter apology. I mean, to write something in post that.
00:42:51
And it's like, remember the trauma of what happened on my show, The Unspeakable Moment. Do you remember that unspeakable moment when Mario Lopez said that children shouldn't make permanent decisions?
00:43:01
Yeah. And then he had to bow to the mob. Because everyone knows a seven year old should just be able to decide whatever gender that they are, and then you say that children are not well equipped to make permanent decisions in their lives.
00:43:12
But the beauty of this is, look, the Oscars doesn't have a host anymore. They have destroyed. And that's the thing. Social justice, because it is neither social or about justice, will destroy every institution that that it is part of once it is let in parasite when it is let in. So so this is another great example of this would be I forget the name of the publishing house, but just in the last couple of weeks, Woody Allen had a memoir coming out and the publishing house because because basically low level employees decided that they didn't want the book to be published.
00:43:41
They did a walkout and they did a walkout. And then what did the publishing house do? They they bowed to it. And now the book won't be published. Now, this is not a commentary on Woody. Woody Allen did or did not do. But the point is that once you let social justice in, it will destroy it will destroy Harvard. Right. I mean, it's destroying Harvard right now. Harvard says if you're Asian, it's going to be harder to get in here.
00:44:01
Asian people happen to be really good at testing and really care about education and family, all those things. You might want more of them if you really care about educating people. Right. So it will destroy Harvard. It did. They they rescinded their offer to Kyle Kuchu because he did something when he was 15 years old. I mean, it's while they put in David Hogg, who is who had lower grades, Kyle graduated number one in school.
00:44:21
I mean, in his class, there's a million examples of this. But every institution we see this at The New York Times, we see this at all of these universities. You let social justice in because you kind of think it's good or you kind of agree.
00:44:33
And next thing you know, it lights a fire and it will suck the blood as a literal parasite can't survive it. So I'm just going to let a little bit of this tape worm into my body and see how it goes for me. No, it doesn't work like that. Right. You immediately have to spell it. And that's what I do. You know, that's why you need to have a spell because there's no room for it. Right.
00:44:50
And it's a difference between being polite and allowing something that, you know, to be fundamentally wrong and backwards. You don't win. I mean, Wayfair Wayfair employees to give another example. No. So after a left Shrikant Street and shrieked about how kids were treated at the border. Remember this, that that phase of the apocalypse, right. Where they want to be, you know, it's gone now. Wayfair. Yeah, we're certainly selling the beds for the kids to sleep on the way.
00:45:13
Fair employees walked out saying that Wayfair should not get the beds. So you're complaining the kids are on the floor under foil.
00:45:21
So you got it now? Right now. Yeah. Now you got to take out the company that's giving them better, because even even being associated with the DHS was problematic. Right. Do you see this makes you don't want the solution. So you like the problem. You don't like the solution. So what are we doing here? This is what they want.
00:45:37
They want this perpetual craziness. And that gets back to where we started here, which is that I really do believe this is a crisis of meaning, which, by the way, I mean, I write about this book. This is one of the things that that brought me back to being more of a believer, by the way, because, you know, they talk about the God shaped hole, these people, the Burnie crew that thinks government can do everything.
00:45:59
It's because they believe man can do everything. And I don't think man can do everything. And by the way, man didn't make me free. I was born free as the birthright of being a human being. There is something before us. Why did the founders talk about God given rights? The state did not make you free. God made you free. Now we can debate all day long about what what that means and what God means and the rest of it.
00:46:21
But they are endlessly trying to fill a hole through outrage, through the next craziness of the day, you know, through any of those things, because they they don't have real meaning. And that that is the huge problem. And the example I always give on this is that you watch The Avengers, right? The Avengers movies you watch on. And so, you know, Thanos basically was Berney. He was a socialist. He thought, all right, I want to there's finite resources in the universe, but what did he have to do to keep the whole thing going?
00:46:51
He was going to kill half of the living creatures in the universe. And that's why socialist kills so many people. Thanos was sitting there going, I'm the only guy, I'll do it. He thought he was the good guy because most bad people think they're the good guys. Right. And that's what these people are leading us to. They want to create this perfect system. There is no perfect system. We're imperfect. We're the ones that built the system.
00:47:13
So the second someone tells you we can do all of these things and Bernie's the perfect example of it because he's never done anything right. Like as as someone that's created things, I'm far more successful. I have a small business. We have eight or ten employees now. Like, we're chugging along doing something nice. I created something. You created something. Bernie's never created something. All he knows how to do is burn things down.
00:47:33
So and then to really get it to where you're at, they will destroy him because of it. They have this ends with Bernie being destroyed. AOC and the rest of the crew once once they realized it didn't work under Bernie and Bernie didn't get them to the finish line, they have to now take him out. So he's going to get his just desserts like poetic justice related to what he unearthed this thing. And congrats, buddy. It's coming for you.
00:47:56
That is so true because they they have to eat their own. And actually, it brings me back to a moment when Charlie when I was just kind of getting started and. And Charlie. I mean, we're sitting down and again, just, you know, fresh can, like, I know something's not right, still kind of learning, but I better learn fast because everybody wants to take me out left and right. Right. Because you got to be the spirit Indonesia to have an answer about every single issue that's ever been discussed.
00:48:17
And the left just want you gone because they don't like you. Go on like this and try something new. So let me ask you questions. And the question they said was the most important question as a conservative to ask yourself is, do you think human beings are basically good or basically evil?
00:48:31
Fundamentally, do we tread towards goodness or evil? Naturally. And and he said to to really understand what conservatism is, is that you have to understand that the answer is evil. Like, you know, like we are taught goodness. Right. And our parents teach us goodness and we're told to make good decisions. But if you leave us to ourselves, the tribal nature takes over. It's, you know, kids. That's why kids hate each other and they're fighting all the time.
00:48:54
But I would almost add to that and I would adapt to it now at the same time. And I would say the most the the biggest question to ask yourself, the fundamental question that I would ask people is, do you think society is perfectible?
00:49:04
Right. Everything is written into that question. If you really think the answer is yes, you were going to be a very easy person to manipulate. Right.
00:49:11
And that's a pretty miserable, miserable and constantly manipulated. If you think is correctable.
00:49:16
And that's what I say, people may go Kandace, how can you say racism doesn't exist? I have never, ever said racism doesn't. I've said not only does it exist, it's always going to exist because that is sort of like a clause of humanity. People are evil, people are mean. There's always going to be like, I don't like David Scott brown hair. I don't like David because he's Jewish. I'll give this guy, she's black.
00:49:34
Whatever it is that's always going to exist. There is no government that is going to stamp out the fact that human beings have bad thoughts, but bad governments have tried.
00:49:43
And guess what? They're usually socialist government.
00:49:45
They're socialist governments. And then, you know, the only thing that they do and they they do do a good job. You have to social credit. They are they are correct to say that they are going to make things equal. They don't make everybody equally miserable. That's the guarantee that you're going to get.
00:49:55
Well, except the top level people who get be great. The government can be great. Yeah, they've got the socialist guy average. Don't make everybody else. Yeah. Miserable. And it's because they are somehow able to sell to people that society is perfectible and they can change the way people think.
00:50:09
But by the way that I can make that's why. Like people.
00:50:12
Yeah but that's why it sounds good for young people. Right. It's utopian.
00:50:15
If you're young it's like, oh everyone before me with some sort of schmuck or an idiot or a buffoon. And it's like that's why I remember when Oprah had that line a couple of years ago about about racism. And she was like, you know, it's mostly old people and they'll die. And it's like, well, now, yes, old people do die, but most of us have had grandparents and most of the grandparents are old and they came from a different time.
00:50:35
And my grandparents weren't racist in any way that I knew. But perhaps, you know, living in a different time, I have no idea what my grandpa did in 1950. Like, I don't know, maybe. But like with the answer be let's say let's say it turned out that my grandfather, who again, I have no evidence that he was racist in any way, probably was, because that was the time, let's just say racist or whatever that meant at the time.
00:50:54
Maybe he didn't do enough to fight. Right. Laws that were in equal or whatever you want to project. Right. Let's just pretend.
00:51:01
Would that make sense that, well, at 86, it would be best if he just dropped dead? Right. That would be the best solution, that these people should just die off. And this is what they do. It's going to die off with that.
00:51:12
And that's going to die off, which will be gone as soon as as soon as your grandparents generation dies off the ability to. It's going to be gone.
00:51:18
And by the way, once you realize exactly what we're talking about right now that we can't perfect the system, then the best thing that you can do, and I think this is how you read Bill, the lefties the best is say, guess what, I agree with you.
00:51:31
There's all sorts of problems, all sorts of problems, and let them list all the all the stuff that they did, you know, that they see as a problem. Right. And say, well, OK, you think Trump is Hitler, you think the evil government does this, blah, blah, blah. Well, how about you just scale back the power of government? How about that? How about we do it that way instead of just giving more power to the thing that you hate the most, hoping that your guy is going to be a lot better than my guy.
00:51:54
Right? Like hoping your team's better than my team. Perhaps that's not the answer. Perhaps the answer is we will just try it in. I would say in small ways, actually, because the American experiment is so good that you don't want to. I don't want to strip the government of all of its power. I don't want to I don't want to fund. That was the thing Bernie was. I want to fundamentally transform the country.
00:52:14
I want a political revolution, which is kind of funny because all revolutions are bloody, every revolution everywhere.
00:52:22
So he just put political in front of it, like the Democrat Socialists, like it or so. What do they do? The I'm a how do they how do they abridge the word?
00:52:30
Yeah, they're democratic. But I mean, I've been saying for years they're just going to drop the Democratic Party soon. I think this election is the end of that. There there will be a Socialist Party that will be more functional socialism, by the way.
00:52:40
And Margaret Thatcher gives a great quote about the difference, which I think it's Margaret Thatcher. Don't quote me on that. But between the difference between socialism and communism is suicide or homicide. So you can do it yourself by buying them into it or they're just going to do it because they're the government take control over like suicide and homicide. Right. So you can vote it in Democrat. You can democratically vote this communism in via Democrat socialism or that they do it themselves.
00:53:02
And I was like, that is the best way to say it.
00:53:04
Is it that you're also the the problem with socialism is eventually you run out of money. Yeah. It's like it's like just so good.
00:53:11
You might have either her Winston Churchill gave the suicide or homicide, you know, so like you could put it out. And if you want those Brits, they're so worried. I know they're so already they really gotten it down. But it's an interesting time to be alive. And I always ask this question on my show. Are you optimistic or pessimistic about the future? Because that's an important it's important question to ask people.
00:53:28
Yeah, well, I definitely could not do this if I wasn't an optimist. I would say I'm a world weary optimist. I am not like some wide eyed optimist. There are some people that just like wake up and they just think like the world will sort of either bend to them or that just magically things will continue to get better. I think we live in a deeply precarious time. We really do like to think about all the things we've talked about here.
00:53:51
These were not things that we really had to talk about ten years ago. Doesn't mean things were perfect ten years ago. But but Bernie. And whatever is happening with the left and the idea that young people kind of think socialism is cool, if that is really what's going on.
00:54:03
And sometimes it's hard to tell because Twitter nonsense and the rest of it, we are in a precarious time that people have forgotten what freedom is and what I think is going to happen. And I did this long thread on New Year's Day about what I think this year is going to be like. And I predicted that this would be the end of the intersectional socialist. And I think we're seeing that now with the Bernie thing. Not that it will be the end of all of the ideas, but I think a lot of it will finally burn out.
00:54:27
I think the adults will start getting back in the room. We have watched this thing come enough of us and I include you in that have hit this thing. You know, Dennis Prager has been fighting this thing forever. Larry Elder. I mean, tons of people that, you know, that we now associate with and can learn from and talk to. It's pretty awesome, actually. But I would say I'm world weary because it's going to take serious work.
00:54:49
It's it takes way more work to tell people it's your life, be responsible, find purpose. All of those things, those things, all kind of sound a little scary.
00:54:58
I said I said no one's ever read. No one no one's ever won an election with the slogan be more responsible.
00:55:03
Yeah. For people elect me to be more responsible. I can tell you guys because no one's ever won an election on that slogan right about elect me.
00:55:10
I don't want anything to do with you. Right. Clean your bed. Make make your bed. No one's ever one on responsibility cause it's a harder pitch.
00:55:17
Did you ever see Brewster's Millions with Richard Pryor now? It's a great it's a great like 1986 movie. John Kennedy's in it. But the premise of the movie basically is that Richard Pryor, he has this long lost relative and old rich white guy who in his will, he has no more relatives left. So he gives Richard Pryor thirty million dollars and he says you have to spend because he hated money. The guy ended up becoming so rich that he became he eventually hated money.
00:55:43
So he says, you're my last relative. So here's the deal. I'm going to give you 30 million bucks, but you have to spend it within a month. And if you do, you'll get 300 million. Otherwise you get absolutely nothing. So what is Richard Pryor do amongst a bunch of funny things that he does with the money he runs for mayor? I think of New York City and they have these. Horribly corrupt Democrat, horribly corrupt Republican, and he runs and his slogan is, is it anyone but us?
00:56:11
It's something like anyone but us or anyone but me, none of the above. That's what it is. None of the above. Meaning? Meaning I can't fix your problems. These idiots can't fix your problems.
00:56:23
And that's that's really what that actually is the American ethos right there. Don't turn to the government to fix your problem. Think about your own life. What what could go wrong in the world of Qantas owns right now, a lot of you could have a lot of problems with your landlord. You could have problems in your relationship, all sorts of things. Right. But what would be the problem that you'd want the government to do now? You might want them to fix the road in front of your house.
00:56:45
And there's some AnCap people would say they shouldn't even do that. I'm OK with the government fixing the road in front of my house. But like, what problem could you actually have?
00:56:52
The best answer would be, I need the government to come and fix it. There's none. Yeah. Look, we live your studio is pretty close to my house, so the exit over here is right between us right now. It's a dump over there because we're in L.A. where we have these ridiculous progressive policies and we can't move homeless people any more. So it's just expanding all over the place.
00:57:09
So there's just a garbage bin. Just it's just like a garbage explosion basically at the at the exit of the highway to get to my house right now. Now, if everything was controlled by the federal government, that would never happen. But what we did was David contacted our local congressman and now still nothing has happened. But we have a better chance. We have a better chance by going to the local guy, then going to the federal guy. And I think that's what people understand.
00:57:31
It's your life. You can't make everyone bow to you. You can't make everyone bend to you. All we can do is make it equal for people. And then and then you got to roll the dice and work hard and and smoke weed and sit on your couch if you want to, or bust your ass and do something else. That's all you can do. And I've watched you do that from day one. And that's why I love it.
00:57:50
I love it. Like, it's it's inspiring and incredible.
00:57:54
The only thing preventing people from their futures are them. You know, it's you are in front of you. As soon as you got out of your own way, you'll be successful. Yeah. And that is a great place to wrap this. Everybody go by. Don't burn this book written by my dear friend Dave Reuben. You're getting good at this.
00:58:08
OK, who is going to wrap and give you a two minute synopsis of his book? That's a fun challenge.
00:58:17
Yeah, a two minute synopsis of Don't burn this book on your mark. Get set world. I give you author Dave Rubert.
00:58:27
Can I get a match in a book? Because that would be the easiest way to do this. Look, I wrote Don't burn this book because I want people to be able to understand that you can think for yourself. It really is as simple as that. I lay out a little bit of what my political journey is and why I left the left and some of that stuff that you guys know about me. But more importantly, I talk about some of the ways and the tactics and the techniques that you will need to escape yourself.
00:58:52
And by the way, since I know a lot of conservatives watch this, it's not just for people that are leaving left, but it's also if you're conservative, I'm guessing you got a brother or a cousin or a friend or a wife or whatever it is, or a kid that is struggling with some of this stuff. And maybe you're struggling with some of this stuff. You might be a conservative who sits with their finger on the button of the remote because you're watching FOX News and you don't want your wife walking in C and you're watching Fox News.
00:59:15
So you flip it to Comedy Central. There's nothing there are so many little things that we're all dealing with related to all this. And I'm trying to give people a little bit of a roadmap to think for themselves. And I make a point. You don't have to agree with me. You don't have to agree with me. But but think for yourself. And if you disagree with me, but can make a good argument, I love it. And then maybe we'll get you on my show.
00:59:33
How was that? That was great. And that's a wrap, ladies and gentlemen. Nailed it.
