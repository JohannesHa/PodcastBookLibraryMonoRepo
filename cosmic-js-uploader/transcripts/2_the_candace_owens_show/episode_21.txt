00:00:08
On your mark, get set world, I give you Roseanne Barr, Nicole Arber, Mario Lopez, Mr. Adam Carolla, Bryan Caplan.
00:00:21
Do you have any liberal friends? Oh, yeah, everybody in my family is liberal, are you kidding me? But I just I just I accept what they are, you know, it's like if they didn't have an arm or something like this. And so I just accept and pray for them. And, you know, I listen to their, you know, like one Trump one I had broke my leg, you know, and I was in this hotel in San Francisco and it was my birthday on November 3rd.
00:00:52
So all my family came and they were with me when we had the election, you know, 16. And I tell everybody he's Trump's going to win by 80 percent. Wow, you know, they're telling me the whole time there's no way, you know, the whole thing. And my one daughter, she'll be very angry at me, but she's really liberal. And when Trump won, she started crying. I'm not kidding. Tears was running down.
00:01:17
Her tears were running down her cheeks. And this is what she said. He's getting a deep look.
00:01:25
That's what she said as a as a white guy, you get pulled over by cops for no front license plate and the guy's a douche, but you don't go, oh, it's because I'm white. You go to the cops a douche, you know, and you I do deals all the time.
00:01:41
It's like the banks not going to lend you the money. You got to put up 40 percent. I'm like, why do I need to put up 40 percent? I have to get there. The rule is, yeah, but I don't go. Oh, it's because I just go. Those are the rules.
00:01:54
Or I have a neighbor who's being unreasonable. And if I was black, I might go, well, that old man's a racist, but I'm white. I go, that old man's just a douche. So my real privilege and being white is not really getting privileges. It's just knowing that the whole world is basically this way.
00:02:12
Right. And it's true. It's 100 percent true. And it's almost like the lens of racism is preventing people from being able to accurately assess what's happening. They don't know that that bad exists. People have a bad day. You get a cup of coffee, you just be having a horrible day. You never know. Maybe he's been up on the road since 3:00 a.m. and his boss is coming home. Everybody has a bad day, including police officers.
00:02:31
We know society is not perfectible with the left sort of cells, black individuals, to say that this idea that it's like anything bad, it happens to us because of your skin color, not because of this is like, you know, just the life. Welcome to life condition of life. There are people are people. Such people are mean. People say mean things and you can have a bad day. And for some reason, black people have started to adopt this idea that we are special, we are special snowflakes.
00:02:55
We are literally society special snowflakes. Anything that happens bad to us. It is because of systemic oppression, systemic racism. And we're seeing that being perpetuated by people like Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, who have race hustled the society.
00:03:08
Do you think comedians are losing their spine a little bit?
00:03:12
They're afraid they are. I'll tell you why. Hmm, unfortunately, I think everybody's really afraid I've seen this with my own eyes, I've had very powerful people call me and tell me this, because the truth is it's very easy to destroy someone's life and take everything away from them. Everything they've worked for happened to me and it's happened to a lot of people I know. And it doesn't take any proof. It takes an allegation. It takes a tweet.
00:03:45
And, you know, people think when you get fired for a tweet you sent out 10 years ago, 15 years ago, and you were joking around, there is no redemption online. And it's it's it's when you have a mortgage and you have children to pay for, you're going to choose that course.
00:04:04
You're going to choose to protect your ability to keep that roof over your head, your car payments and your children in school over an ideology. So what happens is we are living in this time. We are not allowed to speak your mind. You're not allowed to get closer to the truth. You better be on one side or you better be very quiet. And now you can't even be quiet. Now, with this notion of critical race theory and stuff, even silence is violence, right?
00:04:30
It's just what's going on. There are some very bad ideas out there and they're not the ideas that gave us the free society that we have. The only way we move forward is through debate, through the exercise of free ideas and let's see whose ideas best. That's why I like their words on the Internet. Just don't hurt that much.
00:04:51
Like I can literally log off of Twitter at any moment. I just say to myself, it's just incredible to me. Like people had to live through, like, real stuff like world wars, great depressions. And like right now, like, our great war is like I can't deal with mean mean words on the Internet. I'm just like, toughen up. It's true. Turn it off.
00:05:08
You know, those people that get mad that are like super woak and stuff, you've never been through shit. That's how I know you've never been through real shit. So you're mad at words on the Internet or you're mad at an article and there's just the hypocrisy. I know you see it, but like kids don't do drugs while they have blow in their nose, like Hollywood or like don't bully while the same celebrities are posting shit on Twitter, tearing down either the president or someone else.
00:05:34
Oh, my gosh.
00:05:35
It's just a weight off.
00:05:36
One day I'm going to actually release, like, the private messages between me and Djamila Angelil or whatever the on this, like, you know, the actress that was on my podcast, but then canceled it because I said only women can give birth. I made that mistake of a baby saying the truth on the Internet. I made that mistake. I yeah. Well that's that's my. Yeah, that's true though. But prior to that she was like messaging me privately on Twitter.
00:06:01
I just where would it come out on a man. I just don't know what her life. I just I'm trying to picture it. I heard it in her. It's not nice.
00:06:09
Yeah.
00:06:09
To even think about OK millionairess it's weird this I mean the amount of attacks and the nastiness, the things that she said to me and I actually said to her, I just want to confirm you're an anti-bullying activist.
00:06:21
Right. And she said, well, well yeah. But I'm just dishing it to you because you dish it to other people.
00:06:26
I'm like, oh, you're the vigilante bully. Oh, I get it. OK, OK. So you go around and you decide who you're allowed to attack based off of what you decide. People you know, what people you think are deserving of those words.
00:06:38
Oh, I'm like I'm so critical. You're so you're so hypocritical.
00:06:41
It is interesting to to see for a party that are a community that's supposed to be all about inclusive city and diversity, they're with you unless it's diversity of thought. Right.
00:06:53
Or unless they want you to look different but think the same like they're OK. Everybody looks different.
00:06:59
But as long as they are in lockstep and they think the same. And I agree with you that I think it it runs counter to creativity. So when I grew up, I used to watch all of the stand up comedians. Right.
00:07:10
And Chris Rock, there was one bigger and blacker. It's comedic gold. Right. So offensive in that it go back and watch it. He's making fun of school shooters. Like, he's like this is definitely going to be a white guy. That's a white crime. Right. And he's in the room and he's mocking people for being white, for being black, for being Hispanic. And everyone's cracking up. And what people miss about this is culture of being so sensitive is that when you're able to mock everyone and mock yourself, it actually brings you closer.
00:07:38
You stop taking yourself so seriously in comedians.
00:07:40
I'd be I'd be so apprehensive of wanting to get into comedy right now because you feel so handcuffed right now. You like the situation with Kevin Hart a while back. And we know what he's going to host the Oscars and then for something he said. And that's another slippery slope when you start going back years.
00:07:56
Thank God, my bachelor years and all that was pre social media. Right, because he done. Oh, my God. Right. Even imagine all the stuff.
00:08:05
So that's a very scary situations. You know, I think about like future presidents and our future leaders, they're all going to have pictures. Or videos of something and not necessarily that's all, because that's just the way kids are now right there is documented and there's going to be moments of when you're silly and maybe you are so proud of, that's going to come back to haunt them. And that's just a very slippery slope.
00:08:29
They're telling us how we have to think that's fascism. Right? Of course. I want you to think what you want. I want you to live your life. I don't want to jam my views on you. Don't jam your views on me. I don't want to hear that. I believe certain things. That's who I am. You'll never change me. You'll never rock me. And stop it, it's not going to work and I'm not going to try and change you because I know as strongly as I feel you feel the same way I have be more informed than you, but back off why they can't do it like this girl is actress that's out there right now boycotting Georgia.
00:09:10
People of the people in that state can't think for themselves. They can't think for themselves. You do that. But that's the narcissism that I'm talking about right now.
00:09:17
Narcissism is like I am an actress and therefore I know how everyone must think. And if they don't think like me, I'm going to use my position in my publicity to just shut down everything and their views and their perspective and to boycott and to inspire riots against people.
00:09:33
They're OK with violence. Exactly. OK with intolerance. They're OK with that as long as those people are advocating for what they believe. Right.
00:09:41
You don't know me. You don't know more about me than me. Right. We're out of problems, we have a part of our brain that needs to solve problems, fear problems, negotiate with problems and no problems means not no problems to a lot of people. It means let's create problems synthetically so that we can occupy this part of our brain. And, you know, anyone who's ever studied anybody who was really wealthy and oftentimes kept like, if you are wealthy and you are out there earning money every day and you're running a business, then those are your problems.
00:10:31
But if you take that person's husband or wife or whoever the part of the couple is, that doesn't have to go out there and chew up that real estate every day and get to make that money, pay the employees and account for the bottom line and everything. You take the rich person that's at home and doesn't have anything to do, then you'll say, how's your day going? And they'll go, Oh, my God, the florist was late.
00:10:55
It was a disaster.
00:10:57
And it's like the florist. You have a florist. So the florist was late.
00:11:03
Was that's a disaster. Like they're the people that are subject to the hyperbole. Those are the that their dog walker didn't show up on time. And the guy who was supposed to break in your husband's Italian loafers got sick. And it's all a disaster. Right.
00:11:19
You know, and so. If you take human beings, you remove responsibility, obligation and real gravity from their life, they will then create their own problems to fill that in. Now, if you take you know, but it's kind of like when I used to do love line, I used once in a while to talk to a dominatrix. And on the show, you know, not off not all those conversations are very personal, private.
00:11:55
But I always had this theory when they talk about how expensive it was and the guy, you know, like wanted to come in and then I put them in a diaper and he crawled around and I smacked him with his Hugi Buki and and I'd go, these are all rich white businessmen, right?
00:12:12
And she go, Yeah, every time. And I'm like you. I said, never have a poor Mexican guy in there like. Now, and I'm like, you want to know why, because that guy, that guy's life is getting his ass kicked, you know, I mean, that guy's got a foreman who's a douche and he's got to go to work all day and he's got to pay bills. And the rich white guy, he's in charge of the whole place.
00:12:34
And so when he wants his outlet, he wants to be smacked in the ass with a bungee cord and drink out of his bottle. So people.
00:12:45
People will go into their modes depending on what the stimuli is, and you give a person unlimited money and zero problems and they're going to go on a hunt to find problems.
00:12:59
Most of us are living our lives. I got it. I got bills. So I work in a restaurant. I'm not trying to run a restaurant. I'm not thinking about race. I'm really not. I need to get good food to my customers and compete with the restaurant over there, whatever that takes. I got to do the last thing I'm thinking about is how racist we are. I don't have most people just don't have the time. The people that are coming up with these narratives have the time to sit around and think about it.
00:13:23
They're not actually doing the work. They're not they don't have I'm sorry, but they don't have real jobs. One of the things I thought was great about this book, Skin in the Game, is he says, I wonder how many Hollywood celebrities and how many academics, how many economists, how many politicians preaching economic and social equality actually have friends that work with their hands. How many people are at your table, at your dinner table do you invite who are landscapers and plumbers and carpenters?
00:13:46
Just a question. Just a question.
00:13:49
I do believe that as Americans, we are we are extremely uneducated. And the problem is, is that very few countries of America might be the only country that you can get on a plane for six hours and still be in America. And unfortunately, some people are not well traveled.
00:14:01
So one of the blessings of my early 20s that I travel to so many different countries and and traveling and seeing the way other people live really makes you love your country.
00:14:10
That's such an expert. And listen, America, OK, whatever problems we may have, believe me, way better off. And when it's the best country in the world that is not just hyperbole, it really is the greatest place in the world. And when you travel, you really appreciate that. You really get it right, no matter what issues. Right.
00:14:31
And they'll say, oh, well, you know, we're not the best in the world. And people are passing engineering tests at a higher rate in China or in India. And I'm like, do you want to live in India? You know, OK, so maybe there's a different metric. Maybe there's a different way that we're measuring to determine what makes a country great. Everyone wants to come here at the same time that you're calling us a racist, sexist, misogynist society.
00:14:52
You're demanding that we open our borders and let everybody in. But what is it that we have that everybody wants to come in to receive? Right. And I don't think it's handouts. I think it's opportunity. And I fight to protect those opportunities.
00:15:04
You're exactly right. I mean, I'm an example of that, right? Coming here and being first generation. And I don't think I'd be able to do what I was fortunately being able to do if it wasn't here. Right. And and to have these opportunities when you were rattling off all those labels, those words have gotten to the point where they must mean I mean nothing.
00:15:25
I mean nothing. It's sad. And, you know, it's it is.
00:15:27
I was just going to say that it is kind of sad now because there's just so off the cuff and flippant when they disagree with me. Racist. Right. Right. I don't see it my way.
00:15:34
Sexist, right. Exactly.
00:15:36
And what it does is it's something that Dennis Prager always talks about is it actually cheapens evil, where now if you are a racist, you can get away with it because they're calling everybody racist.
00:15:45
Right. So when somebody says this guy's racist, it's like, well, they said Cannis is a racist. I'm being called a white supremacist.
00:15:50
I mean, this is really this is really where we've got in society. It's funny when I read headlines that say that, you know, the first ever black white supremacist and I'm just I'm not a good could that they call me. It makes me feel like shit could never fly today, by the way. Right. Like today, a lot of the comedy could never fly tonight.
00:16:12
Go watch any of those things that we used to laugh at. If you even laughed at that skit like we just laughed, they would have you labeled. They would say this isn't funny because everyone's so sensitive and they can't take a joke. And it's problematic because, like I said, being able to laugh at one another, that's what brings us together.
00:16:27
And I remember being on The View and just being dumbfounded that these women didn't understand that they were mad about nothing. Yeah, it was.
00:16:37
Yeah, they do. That's what the view is all about. Yeah. I saw it today. They were backing white nationalists. I don't know when this will air, but today they got an applause break for white nationalists. And I just flipped my coffee table just to be dramatic. And I was like, we're living in South Park. It has happened. This is a real. Who were they defending? Some.
00:16:57
I forget his name, but he is like a lead white nationalists, because he talks to me about Trump and they were like, he's talking about Trump.
00:17:04
That's a rule. Yeah. No matter what, it doesn't matter who says it, if it's against Trump, the left just like completely says it's OK. It's fine.
00:17:11
As a comedian, this show is hilarious. Not just yours. Politics of America. Wow. You guys are dramatic.
00:17:17
It's the longest running. I don't know if it's a sitcom or if it's some. It's very days of our lives. General Hospital, almost a little Spanish soap opera is very soap opera.
00:17:29
Why is she yelling for no reason? Yeah, you know what I mean. Like, I know I always say that.
00:17:33
I'm like, what is the perception outside of the walls of America and what's going on here?
00:17:38
Because like you saw on the TV and it is just so theatrical. I mean, you can't compete with our real life here. There's no point in. Making soap operas, there's no point in making Broadways because like we are living it every single day here in America, the musical. Yeah, right. And the award shows and like like the other day with Michelle Williams we were talking about, I had an abortion, but now I have this piece of plastic.
00:18:01
I was like, I wish I was wearing what planet we were on. So for people that are watching us, if you didn't watch the Golden Globes, I definitely didn't either. I just then went to go find clips because Ricky Gervais was just so amazing in roasting the room. But there is Michelle Williams, who is an actress who accepted an award for something.
00:18:19
And she goes up and she probably actually she gets a little statue for something. She gets a little statue, and she gives this speech, which was pro-abortion. And she basically said, I would have never earned this inanimate object if I did not kill my baby and get an abortion years ago. And the room broke out into applause for this speech here and there.
00:18:41
But here I'm crying and I'm just like the crazy you're crazy people. You like the same people that are like Tomalin did cocaine in the 80s who didn't, from what I know, and they hate him because of that or like kill the babies. Yeah, it's just weird. I was literally just like this is this is the Twilight Zone, like, oh, this is this is why people think Hollywood is just like an infestation at this point. Because I was like, what a bizarre thing.
00:19:05
Like you murdered your child for an inanimate object and we're supposed to be celebrating that.
00:19:10
It's very strange. When I was in school, I learned what rape actually was like.
00:19:14
This is before the tide of radical feminism. And it was like, here's you can be date raped and then you don't remember things and you're dragged, you're in an alley and raped was a very serious word. Now it's like I got drunk last night. I slept with someone and I kind of regret it. So I'm going to go to the police and they're being taught that that's rape and. No, no, that's regret, sweetheart.
00:19:34
Like somebody like that is there's a difference between rape and regret at the time they do this show thing, they got a show going on. But what's behind it is the real story. So while they're doing that show, here's the fact that real rape victims, they're not even processing the rape kits like I know where I live in Hawaii, they had the backlog of rape kits on our whole island and people who who are really raped and go to the police, they don't even do anything about it anymore.
00:20:06
Interesting.
00:20:07
There's a backlog of like two years worth of rape kits that haven't even been I could believe it because it's not that real rape isn't trendy right now where rape is not trendy, like it's it's social media rape, like, oh, I remember this guy like a guy touched my middle school and I didn't give him consent. Like, did you swing around to him, not touch your butt? Because that's what I did in middle school. My first time my butt got slapped.
00:20:28
I was in seventh grade and the guy's name is Devin. And I turned around and I said, don't smack my ass. I think he went on to become a great father. And if we didn't need to ruin his life, I did not scar me for the rest of mine.
00:20:39
And and that was what that's really true, is that women are like, oh. Being encouraged to be conniving, conniving little wimps, yeah, instead of going, I told, you know, right now, do you want me to bring my brother over here tomorrow? Right, because he's big, right?
00:20:57
Like, do it again. And that's how I grew up. And that was OK. And it was fine. And you and kids are funny and they go they go hormonal phases and everyone starts getting interesting and we're just getting their bodies. Everybody lived and survived middle school, early high school and everything was fine. And now they're making even that. If a man is attracted to a woman, it's somehow becoming something that is is dirty and disgusting.
00:21:19
So there are some weird trends. And one of the weirder ones for me at least, to try to process is this new trend where celebrities are coming out. And I know Charlize Theron did this a few a few weeks ago and saying that their child is picking their gender. And this is strange to me just because I and they say, oh, I looked at my child.
00:21:36
My child was swimming in a bathtub and looked up and said, Mommy, I'm a boy. And that's weird because even though I'm not a parent, I need four, five years of my life. And the things that come out of children's mouths like they are just they say whatever in the moment, you don't know what they've seen on TV, what got in their head.
00:21:54
Right.
00:21:54
And I've had children say they were mermaids. I've had children say they could fly and jump off of a staircase. And thank God I caught him. Right, because he thought he could be Superman.
00:22:03
And so I'm trying to understand this new Hollywood mentality where they just think that their children now have the mental authority.
00:22:13
And and and I introduced myself, please don't let me into that hole. No, no. I see you're not doing that in your household. No.
00:22:22
I mean, I'm kind of blown away, too. And look, I'm never going to tell anyone how to parent their kids, obviously. And I could give you company. You should, though, because you seem to be doing something right.
00:22:32
Thanks. You know, I would say if you come from a place of love, you know, you really can't go wrong. But at the same time, I got it. You're three years old and you're saying you're feeling a certain way. You're you're you think you're a boy or girl, whatever the case may be, I, I just think it's dangerous as a parent to make that determination then.
00:22:49
OK, well then you're going to be a boy or girl, whatever the case may be. And it's sort of alarming. And my gosh, I just think about the repercussions later on.
00:22:58
And to me, I just see depression because I when I was in fifth grade and it was this weird thing in fifth grade or me and my girlfriend Molly, like, we just we were tomboys.
00:23:07
We just were like, we're tomboys now. So we were like, baggy your pants.
00:23:10
The cargo pants were in. And I tried to my voice a little bit deeper one year, went to middle school and everything was fine.
00:23:17
You know, it was just a phase.
00:23:19
And I hadn't gone through puberty yet. Like, you can't make a decision about your sexuality when you're three years old. I was in fifth grade.
00:23:25
Well, that's just it. I don't think you're when you're a kid, I you know, at least when I was a kid, I remember kids. I still think my daughter from boys have cooties. And, you know, so I don't think they they they're you don't know anything about sexuality yet. You're just a kid. Right.
00:23:40
And then making that determination so young. I just see like if my parents when I was like, I'm going to be a boy today, shaved my head and we're like, that's you've made the decision. I can't even imagine how depressed I'd be once I went through puberty, once I started liking guys and then having made up my mind when I was in fifth grade. And I think that's that's a really scary trend that we're seeing coming out of Hollywood right now.
00:24:03
And at the core of it, to me, seems like narcissism, like virtue signalling.
00:24:07
Like you just want to say, I'm so tolerant and I'm so accepting that whatever my kid wants to do, they can do.
00:24:15
Yeah, I think as parents need to allow their kids to be kids, but at the same time, you've got to be the adult in the right. The situation. Porres with that. And I think the formative years is when you start having those discussions and really start making these declarations. And it's way too young for some of these other that I just personally think it's just way too young.
00:24:36
Yeah, we're not psychologically there when we're three years old.
00:24:40
The second the voters figure out they can vote themselves money, it's all over. And that's essentially I'm going to offer you free health care and free college tuition. And it's like, well, I'm going to give free college tuition, health care, and I'll eliminate any debt. Oh, OK. Maybe that guy now and it's like that the experiment is over and the politicians have figured out that it's like you got two kids in the house and I'm running on a platform of scrambled eggs and oatmeal in the morning and my wife's running on a platform of Reese's peanut butter cups.
00:25:25
And nobody needs to go to school on Mondays. And they go, oh, we're voting for your mom right now. And then I'm going, but that's unhealthy. And in the big picture, it's not going to be good. You know, your dental hygiene is not going to be good. There's early onset diabetes. You're not going to be properly educated. When you enter the workforce, you're like, yeah, OK, we'll be enjoying our peanut butter cup over here.
00:25:50
That's such a perfect analogy. That's that's what it is. And the politicians have been like, well, let's just offer peanut butter cups.
00:25:57
And that literally reminds me of an elementary school we had we had to like a president for our class or our grade.
00:26:05
And there were two people running in each other and one of them just ran, you elect me. It was like a mock election of free. We're going to have free lunch and blah, blah, free this and free that. And they went and they got really glittery nice posters and that person won like no one cared.
00:26:16
I mean, about the economics of it. He said there's going to be like we didn't actually get it. It was like a mock election. But the kid that won was the one that offered the most free stuff.
00:26:23
So really, fundamentally, what you have on the left is people that have adopted an elementary, elementary, fifth grade, you know, election style, you know, how am I going to get elected in a group full of people that don't they can't help themselves. I don't want to help themselves be. But love free stuff.
00:26:40
Yeah, it seems to be the majority. It's a steady diet of free stuff mixed in with your victim. And I'm going to fix that for right and victims.
00:26:49
Easy, by the way. And you always wonder why people love all these different categories of how to be a victim, because victim was easy life stuff, right? Saying, hey, you know what, life life's really tough and it's tough for everybody. It's not it's not an easy thing to be a good human being, to be a productive human being every single day, day in and day out. So it's much easier to offset all of your problems and to say, you know what, it's not my fault if I fail here.
00:27:09
Forget getting back up. Right, forget getting back. I'm trying. I'm going to say I failed because of this. That's an easy pass, right? To say I'm actually yeah, I know I haven't done anything my life, but it's because of the white person, the tall person, the rich person, the whatever person. That's all me.
00:27:24
Did you say ruggedly handsome or did I just hear you just heard ruggedly handsome, tall, white, rich matinee idol.
00:27:32
Good luck. I would check the tape. Wait, was that a microaggression.
00:27:36
That's your problem because you're tall and wealthy and white and heterosexual. Like that's like the last thing I want to be inside. If I could pick I'm so happy I'm black and a woman. I'm like, gosh, I'm going to be at her sexual white male in society right now. It's where you guys are catching all the heat.
00:27:50
I don't get the media. I honestly don't because they're all wealthy. And if the country goes socialism, their money's gone. Really interesting, they're almost advocating for things that are going to bring harm upon themselves, and I think I don't I don't think they think it's going to affect them. And the other side of that is. This listen, I am I am so much more liberal than liberals are and in a lot of ways. I don't care, I don't put people in boxes, you're not black, you're not Asian, you're not gay, you're not this.
00:28:29
You're you're an American, right?
00:28:32
And I don't want to put you in a box if if you're if you're an Asian guy and you're right for the job, great if you're not ready for the job. Sorry. Can help you, but they put people in a box and they want to control those people, I don't want to control anybody. Right. And that to me, is everything but the media. We have friends we had dinner with the other night, they're Egyptian, they're wonderful people that Christians and this guy was going on about what he grew up with.
00:29:05
In Egypt and a very small population, percentage of the population there is Christian and what they went through and it was you know, it was weird to hear what he was telling me about how they they were afraid and they were shunned and they wouldn't fight so much. But but he went through a tough time. He came here and he went, oh, my God, how could you why would you want to turn this place into any place that anybody else comes from?
