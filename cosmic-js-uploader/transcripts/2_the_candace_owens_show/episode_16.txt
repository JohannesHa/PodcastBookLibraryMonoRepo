00:00:07
One of the greatest tweets ever, and I was like 100 followers. I was like, well, you know, what is what it is?
00:00:13
Yeah, yeah. Cool, you guys ready? OK, ladies and gentlemen, we are rolling into another episode of the Kandace Owens Show. I know that I get tons of fan mail and letters and emails from parents who are really concerned about the state of the world today. And you guys are asking yourself, should I really be sending my kids to college? Is not like the college and university scene when you guys were growing up. We're seeing it grow increasingly more radical, especially in the context of today.
00:00:48
Whenever you see those images of a bunch of people trying to pull down a statue, you can bet anything. It is a cogill of college students without question.
00:00:59
What's really going on, going on in college campuses. And I had the honor of speaking at Trinity College, which is in my home state of Connecticut, and came across a very interesting situation with this student sitting across from me. Nick Engström, welcome to the campus own show.
00:01:16
Yeah, thank you so much for having me. I'm so excited to share my story and to talk about college.
00:01:22
We were sort of looking to have someone from the university on my show. But it's difficult because, of course, if you come on to my show when you're at university, you basically sign yourself up to be canceled and bullied. So but the good thing is you've already been canceled.
00:01:35
You know, when you're when you're essentially labeled a white supremacist and get fired around campus, which I'm sure will get to, pretty much nothing really stops you from doing anything else. Right.
00:01:44
So let's just get to your backstory first before we get into the story of what happened and how the faculty and the students were all involved. Where are you from?
00:01:51
So I'm from Swampscott, Massachusetts, on the North Shore, about twenty five minutes north of Boston.
00:01:57
OK, so when you finished high school, you said, I'm going to apply. And which was Trinity College, your number one pick, were you excited about the prospect? Yeah, yeah.
00:02:04
So really interesting. I've been a lifelong conservative and a Republican and I've always been fascinated by politics and I've always wanted to come to DC and just study it and learn about it. And one of my favorite people, Tucker Carlson, went to Trinity. Jessie Waters also went to Trinity. George Will. It had this reputation of being like a center right school for kids that want to either make it on Wall Street or in D.C. So I really I fell in love with it, fell in love with the campus in the lives.
00:02:32
And I was really, really excited to go in the fall.
00:02:34
So that that was already in your thought process when you were applying. Are you actually thinking about is this school center right or is it going to be far left? That's really interesting.
00:02:42
Yeah, I definitely and like well, what I what I really wanted was, is I wanted a liberal arts education, which is liberal in nature. The good typewrite, the type where you can be well-rounded and it's interdisciplinary and you can just learn as much as possible. Like if I could save your class on Karl Marx, but then counter it with a class on, you know, the future of markets and kind of learn about how, you know, he's contradicts himself in his writing.
00:03:09
That's really what I wanted. And I thought that, you know, Trinity being a liberal arts school but with a center right student body would be the perfect place.
00:03:16
So you what you wanted was essentially a true college experience where you get to experience different ideas and sort of make up your mind on what you think is right. Exactly. But that is not the state of college campuses today. No, it's really not.
00:03:29
And you made a terrible, terrible, disgusting, horrible, horrible white supremacist decision. Can you please tell my audience what it is that you did?
00:03:37
Yeah. So, guys, I read books on John Locke and on Western Civilization. So what happened was, is that I don't know if anyone's familiar with the Churchill Institute, but it was somewhat started at Trinity back in twenty sixteen and we decided that we wanted to make a club version of it. We felt, and this is me and my friends, that there just wasn't enough emphasis on the Western tradition and our education. If we were taught it, we were taught about it from a really negative light and we just wanted to and we didn't really want to be taught it necessarily.
00:04:12
We just wanted to read about it. We wanted to kind of see the facts for ourselves and then make our own decisions. Because, you know, you talk to a lot of people today and it's really a divisive topic, which is sad that that kind of the birth of our nation and that, like our entire society, is a divisive topic. But, you know, you talk to someone and Western civilization is the greatest thing on Earth. You talk to someone else and it's the worst, most atrocious thing that could ever happen in the world.
00:04:38
So we really want to get to the bottom of that. So we started reading these books and we wanted to bring speakers to campus with that. And I think that this is standard. If any college students listening, you have to go through kind of a ridiculous process to get speakers on campus. I'm sure you might have maybe experience some of that with. Well, it's not true.
00:04:57
It's only if you want to bring conservative. Yeah, it's actually a very easy process. If you if you want to bring Linda Sarsour or somebody else on the campus.
00:05:04
Exactly. So so we tried to get approval to do this. I mean, it's essentially rubber stamp to for more context, I also run college Republicans on campus. We had to redo our SGA approval that fall of my freshman year and it passed unanimously.
00:05:19
So which I. The thing was really interesting, so politically, kids don't really care as much, but when we go on to the academic sphere, so this is going to be an academic club where we will bring academic.
00:05:28
Wait, hold on. You said you had to pass your SGA. Oh, sorry. Student Government Association.
00:05:33
Sorry, no worries.
00:05:35
But with that, we let it pass very quickly through the SGA. Yeah, OK. Yeah.
00:05:41
So it's essentially like a rubber stamp. It's not supposed to be a big deal. I mean, it's a bunch of college kids just granting you approval to use the room or not. When we had the Churchill thing, I got to the podium to present and I was greeted by, I think around like 40 to 50 protesters already protesting our club before it was even existing. The argument is, is that Western civilization is a dog whistle term for white supremacy.
00:06:07
So essentially, if you believe in individual freedom, human rights, capital markets, then your white supremacist group. So really great to hear.
00:06:18
Yeah. So and what I think is really interesting is they kept on using this term dog whistle over and over again. And I think that it's what I see it as and I think we see it all the time now is that the left is essentially using Western civilization as a dog whistle turn for themselves as a way to take away freedom. I think that all the time when you hear the word Western civilization, I mean, people in the West cringe.
00:06:40
They're like, oh, human rights, like freedom. Like I want to take those away from you. And you really kind of start to get those those vibes when you're on a college campus and you can see them morph into students. And, you know, you can have a couple just standard typical mainstream kids come to campus and for years go by and there are leftists and it's crazy.
00:07:00
And, you know, it is interesting that they think that there is something fundamentally wrong and backwards about the very civilization that allows them to do what they do in terms of protesting and shrieking, because it certainly couldn't go on in an eastern civilization, you know, without severe consequences. I mean, could you imagine if a bunch of kids on a college campus, they did that once? I think they called that the Iranian revolution in Iran or, you know, we know what goes on in China.
00:07:24
So it's interesting that the exact same civilization that gives them the permission to do what they do, they discredit and they talk badly about it and they say that they fundamentally want to dismantle. Yeah.
00:07:35
And I think the the answer to that question is, is that they don't know what it really is. One person asked me was like, you can't read John Locke because he was pro slavery and slaves was like, well, like, I actually I kind of like laughs because I was like, am I being punished? Like, I really thought that in my head because it's so first of all, he was writing after slavery was basically like a taboo.
00:07:57
And in England and he he was like probably one of the most antislavery philosophers of the time. And even now with the Enlightenment, I mean, our Declaration of Independence is mostly based off of his scholarship. So I just was like, you obviously have no idea what you're talking about.
00:08:13
It reminds me of when Colin Kaepernick was boycotting the Betsy Ross flag. Yeah. Because he said that it had very racist undertones and like, he clearly had no idea who Betsy Ross was.
00:08:23
Yes. I mean, like, I think it's just and they did it. The thing that the thing that's crazy is that, you know, they actually win their arguments like they they actually removed the shoe. So he was fundamentally wrong. It was a fundamentalist comment because people were, you know, a part of the abolitionist movement. And yet they still said, OK, we have to do away with this flag. And this is kind of what's interesting about the left is that they hate everything about specifically Western history.
00:08:47
Right.
00:08:47
We know that slavery began, you know, in the Middle East. Right. We know that slavery was lasted longer in Eastern society. We know the West was the first to end it. And yet they find something to be problematic about Western civilization and Western civilization. What is it you think they're after?
00:09:04
So I think I think that's a great question. And I think you've been studying that a lot, I think recently. And I think the what it is, is that. When we talk about slavery and I try to say this all the time, where you can't like you can have a Western society, but you can have anti-Western policies and systems in as well, it's not like things just change overnight, like like slavery, Jim Crow, segregation laws.
00:09:30
Those don't those don't correlate with the West. Right. Those aren't Western values. But we had them. And I think that that's more of a conversation about policy and changing policies and moving past that. And I think one of the things and it's I think the most ironic part is that Western civilization is progressive. Right? It's you're kind of studying it in a linear sense of that moving forward progress where slavery was a sin. We realized that we made amends and we tried to move forward versus other civilizations that haven't done that yet.
00:09:59
And I think that that is essential to kind of Western thought. And I think that that's the biggest piece that the left misses, is that their idea of progress and, you know, is progressive, essentially to hate them and to try to cancel me and to fire me around campus. Yet, like, I'm trying to read the person that essentially helped cultivate that, like John Locke, the Enlightenment. That was when that the whole idea of progress came into place.
00:10:25
I just find it really ironic. And I think the left really targets Westerns. They've been really putting an emphasis on on the slavery aspect because they'll realize that they're wrong. And I really think and I think you date back the Democratic Party has been all about power. Four since since they've been around and it's grasping on to that power as much as they can, and if currently right now what gives them power is bashing a Western civ. So they're going to keep doing it as they gain power.
00:10:54
And it seems to work every time. Like you said, that Colin Kaepernick I mean, his argument made no sense, but yet he was able to get an entire brand, multibillion dollar brand to just change because he felt offended, right?
00:11:07
That's right. Even if you're wrong and you feel offended that that's enough. And, you know, I want to I want to get this right, but I can't remember who I was reading. It was probably Tommaseo.
00:11:15
I feel like he's the person who was always reading the most, but they had said that he actually might have been Shelby Steele. But in their book, they had mentioned that one of the thing that the left gets really wrong and I think it's interesting because you said you feel like these students just don't know. So there is an element of ignorance that's at play. But one of the things that they get wrong is the idea that, you know, when we did formally acknowledge that slavery was wrong and that when we did formally acknowledge that Jim Crow laws, you know, laws were wrong, that that was somehow acknowledgement that Western civilization was wrong and that the creation that everything in America was doing was wrong prior to really, though, the battle for civil rights.
00:11:49
Now, I'm almost sure it was Shelby. Shelby Steele was a battle to actually get Americans to recognize the constitution that they had already written. Right. So all men are created, but that was already in the Constitution. That part was right. And what we were pushing for was for the society to acknowledge what we had already said was true, not to undo it. And I think today you're correct that we have this ignorance. We have a tremendous ignorance problem where they think everything that happened prior to the 1964 civil rights bill is wrong and beyond it.
00:12:18
I mean, you know, there's tons of things they want to cancel even up to the 1980s, but, you know, needs to be thrown away in that circumstance. You really get people throwing out the baby with the bathwater.
00:12:28
Yeah. And I think that that's a perfect way to sum it up. And I think you can even go a bit further. And I've noticed this in college with the ideas that you're just sort of we all acknowledge that there was some hypocrisy within Western civilization, within no civilization is perfect. And we worked through them. Right. We realize that these issues were wrong. We realized that these systems were hurting people and we changed it. What I think is really interesting is on the topics of civil rights, and I think and you went to university Rhode Island, you know, black people and people of color didn't really have an opportunity to get an education for a long time.
00:13:08
Right. They weren't exposed to the idea of having a liberal arts education in interdisciplinary. Now black and brown people finally have a seat at the table there, finally have the opportunity to be well versed in this and they're taking it away from them.
00:13:23
Like now you come to school and you're essentially reading and studying why these systems are bad. If you're going to school right now and if you're of color, you're learning not that the entire thing that you're oppressed.
00:13:37
It's kind of all that you are the system that you thought to get inside of, you got inside of and you want to bring down now. Yeah. Which is is kind of kind of backwards. And that's sort of what I do a lot of my work trying to get people to look up like you can't want, you know, integration and segregation at the exact same time. But again, this is a new culture. And I think that this everything that we're seeing, whether it's the women's movement, whether it's black lives matter, you know, whatever whatever group you're looking at, antifa, this is unlike any of our ancestors, even the ones that are still breathing.
00:14:04
And I say that all the time. You know, black people of that grew up in the 1940s, like my grandfather would not recognize the black people today. The women that grew up, you know, in the 1950s would not recognize what, you know, what feminism is today. So we are seeing sort of a corroding of our society. I want to pivot and get back into your story. Yeah. So you say you want to start the Winston calling it a club institute.
00:14:26
Yeah.
00:14:26
So the Churchill called the church and you're and you're already getting protested for saying that you want to start the club and the people that are protesting are showing up at the sky.
00:14:36
Yeah. So so we're currently it's just like an open door meeting. We're trying to get approval. 50 people show up and they're protesting it. I stood there and I answered. But an hour and a half worth of questions just about sort of ridiculous things on the lines of like, well, like, how can you read this?
00:14:54
How how are you going to counter these points? And like, well, so that's the point. The point is to study this one specific area because we feel like it's lacking in other areas of our curriculum.
00:15:05
And I think that, you know, where people really were, they felt unsafe, that we're having this like campus, that we were going after them for some reason.
00:15:12
This is the club.
00:15:12
They're not required to be in the club. You're saying we want to read some books, you know, from from the Enlightenment era.
00:15:19
Right. And they're saying, oh, yeah, that you're going to read this book written by Plato, this book written by John Locke. And these are the concerns that they're raising.
00:15:28
Yeah, just the very idea of us say not engaging in their narrative made them lose their minds, even though it was on your own time. It was on our own time. And we just wanted to say we wanted to bring a speaker to campus. We could then have that luxury of doing so, the idea was that it was going to be outside of the classroom, we were trying to change the curriculum. We realized that was a battle that was way too difficult for us to do at the time.
00:15:52
And we just were like, let's try to enrich ourselves and get more people involved. So if you didn't want to do it, you don't have to do that. So I think that that also speaks volumes for like where these where everyone is right now, which is that even me doing something on my own time, I go to school that that that I pay for where I want to study, what I want to study. And I'm being told I can't.
00:16:16
Hmm. That, I think is a as an issue. And I don't really know how we solve that.
00:16:23
I think we solve it by first acknowledging that. And I think that you talk about in your intro with parents and like kind of like what what is it like for my child to go to school today? And it's true. It's like we need to start realizing that. Like, it's not just talk. People talk about, oh, there's like basket weaving classes that like this liberal arts school is like that that exists. That's fine. That can exist.
00:16:44
But like it also needs to be balanced. And when you take the liberal out of a liberal arts education, what you left with, I know I'm going to kill myself for saying this or I'm going to be mocked.
00:16:54
But there is another TOMMASEO book called Inside the Education System, and it's like the dogma I'm with. The subtitle is with something to do with the Dogma, The Education System. And he sort of talks about this this illusion where actually right now you have more kids graduating than ever before, but they're dumber than they've ever been.
00:17:12
Yeah, they're not passing academic tests, you know, standardized tests. We are actually seeing the dumbest people that are able to graduate college. We sort of explores why that is and obviously need data and facts are all there. So it's indisputable. And he talks about this dumbing down of the American education system since the civil rights era and sort of this idea that there was something fundamentally wrong with the American education system when in fact, prior to the civil rights era, we actually had the best schools, I mean schools to rival the world.
00:17:42
And now when I see every day that they're taking away these books, like I mean, I study John Locke, I was black. I didn't know there was anything problematic about I was black when I was a student, too.
00:17:52
And that didn't change then black my whole life. And there we studied those books. Nothing was wrong with it. They just canceled To Kill a Mockingbird. Right. And I sold those books. Nothing wrong with it. Nobody felt this anger or this angst and selling these books. It was considered a, well, a more well-rounded education.
00:18:08
By the time I got into college, things were starting to shift. And he talks about that shift and what they're introducing now, even so far as to make people feel acclimated. Ebonics classes saying that even the language, the English language is something fundamentally wrong with that. We need to do a job of making people feel more cultured and introducing Ebonics writings and horrible poetry. And so when you say that that they're that they feel threatened by you wanting to educate yourself, you're really pointing to a larger issue.
00:18:34
Yeah.
00:18:35
And I think that's so true. And I think that larger issue stems from school administrations, because I think that I always use as an example, Columbia University and Providence College. They are probably two of the last schools that teach that studying Western civilization part of their graduation requirements. So you go to Columbia, you have to take six classes in their Western civilization's department in order to graduate. And I think that that's great.
00:19:00
And I think that like all these other schools, what you're seeing is you're seeing an administration cultivating a culture that allows really anything and everything to be canceled. And I think that that's the issue. So so it's and that's what I think. Like, I don't I don't think we necessarily need to, like, hold a lot of these students accountable because it's like they're being conditioned to think this way. It's not their fault, you know, it's not their fault.
00:19:20
And I think that that's important to kind of acknowledge in that it's like the real issue here is, is higher ed. All right.
00:19:26
Let's talk about higher ed, assuming these kids start protesting and your administration says, Nick, we've got your back. We are going to make sure that this Winston Churchill Institute gets started, club get started here. And I'm sure that's what happened.
00:19:38
Yeah, I mean, like in, you know, great world, it would have, but it didn't at Trinity. So to kind of just walk you through the timeline. So not only was I faced with, like, personal harassment from wanting to study Western civilization institutionally, we were set up to fail from the get go. So like I said earlier, it's like a rubber stamp approval to get to get approval on campus. They were like, well, because so many people are against this, so many people I mean, like fifty fifty people are against this.
00:20:12
We are going to hold town halls on this issue. So our approval was still in a month. We then had to go to two town halls. There were probably like two hundred people in your town hall. And we just had to listen to people's questions and comments on why they didn't think the club should exist.
00:20:28
Give me some sample questions. So, yes, so someone and some comments. So the best would be and I think the ones that I feel unsafe having this club on campus, that it's it's an. Atrocity and I don't feel like I belong at Trinity with a Churchill club on campus. We were accused of having a brother money.
00:20:53
That's my favorite accusation that I get. You get that all the time. All the time. And I just want to say I'm not against taking their money, but I don't I don't have taken it. Know, I mean, like I'm just saying, like, I'll take the Koch brother money, but like, it's a weird thing when you're conservative, you get there's a lot of money. It's like it's like, what is that? Yeah, I think it's the craziest argument.
00:21:11
And this is what mostly the faculty would make is that we were essentially taking money from the Koch brothers and then we were using it to run this club, to then rig elections like student government elections. And I'm like, where did that idea come from? Like, we literally just want to have like two dinners a year and like read books like I'm like now like four by the Koch brothers.
00:21:31
Yeah, like now, now, now there's like this conspiracy theory that, like, we're out to like rig elections and it's just like it's the craziest with Coke money.
00:21:41
And that escalated quickly. Yeah.
00:21:43
It's so I think that and the thing is, like, again, like I'm with you, like if they gave us money like so sure. Like yeah of course. Like to study something, I'm going to take the money. But they haven't donated to schools I think in like over three years, like they stopped doing that program.
00:21:58
They never donated to me. So I mean, I wish I was guilty of Coke, but I'm just not. But if you're watching Koch brothers, we'll take it. We'll take it here.
00:22:05
I pray for you. Thanks. Yeah. No, I mean, but and they were like their professors that are like sitting in their basements, like concocting. I almost think the argument is kind of boring. And do you ever get that vibe where, like, you're Republican and like the best argument they give you is that, oh, you're like laundering deep state money? It's totally bizarre.
00:22:23
It's like it's like, first of all, where does that come from? And to like, how is that like can we talk about the issue of Western civilization, right. Like like let's get back on track and like, they just wouldn't. So those were like a lot of the town hall questions.
00:22:36
Most people made the same question over and over again. So everyone would come up and be like, Western civilization is white supremacy. They said that in our mission statement, we said expansion. They took that as like legit like domestic terrorists expansion like like like KKK stuff. I'm like, what are you talking about?
00:22:55
Like we're reading books. Like we put expansion in there because I think we we wanted to expand our knowledge and expand our our horizons with it.
00:23:04
It's a dog whistle and the word expansion is a dog whistle for wanting to expand your club into a cell for the Ku Klux Klan. Right.
00:23:11
I mean, it just it just gets out of you can't even make it up like. So then it got so then what happened was after that, I mean, they were like super. I just sat there and I was just like, this can't be happening like like this can't be like real.
00:23:26
But it was so me and a few other club members, we decided that let's meet with the people that are voting on this to approve us. I feel like I'm a pretty personal person.
00:23:36
I feel like if I talk to some people, maybe I can understand what the real issue is and maybe we can talk about it and talk it out. I was naive, obviously, but. But I mean, so so I get in there and I thought we had a pretty productive conversation and I kind of was talking about the things with you, which is that I recognize the hypocrisy in some ways that Western civilization has had. But every day Western Civ strives to to correct those mistakes and to move forward.
00:24:04
And I think that, you know, the freedoms that we have right now are given to us by that our ability to sit in this room and have this conversation and debate. Western civilization can only happen because of Western civilization and just no one really got it. So we even talked about changing some of some of our mission statement or just changing the wording just to kind of get it over with. And they wouldn't even budge on that. So we kind of realize it like they don't care.
00:24:31
This isn't about us, actually, like. This isn't about us reading books. This isn't about us doing anything, it's that professors, administrations, and this happens all over the country and have conditioned students to believe that Western civilization is bad for no apparent reason, just in a way to just gain power over the narrative that they want. And I personally think it's pretty unclear whether a narrative is because it's all over the place, but somewhere it is being pushed and it is not pro Western civilization.
00:25:03
I find a lot of the professors are just losers. I really do. I mean, I hate to say it, but I hope that we just have a lot of professors that are losers. And I wish that it was more of a and again, and getting that from that TOMMASEO book, I mentioned that there was more of a merit based system and becoming teachers. He actually teaches you in that book that the people that graduated with the lowest test scores in universities are the ones that go on to become teachers, the people that have the lowest IQ that universities are, the ones that are studying education.
00:25:30
Those are the ones that are literally going to become the teachers. So I think I think that a lot of these people have found such little success in their life that it naturally stakes them against Western civilization, progress, capitalism, free markets. Right. And I'm not saying all them. There are some amazing professors and usually those ones don't get tenure for free because if you win teacher of the year, professor the year, they don't want you. Right.
00:25:52
It's a really rotten system. And how they keep teachers around and they're more focused on making them, you know, write research papers than they are and helping them, making them actually teach the students that they're they provide for. So it's a very ugly system and they are to blame.
00:26:04
It's actually really funny that you brought that up, too, because that was one of the reasons why I think I was attracted to Trinity, because Trinity actually has a 10 to one student faculty ratio. I really wanted to be in seminars and engaging professors and work with them. And it's just funny because like now I'm in this situation and I have a few professors that I love at Trinity that I work with that really help me. But again, like a lot of them are sort of preaching this whole that like the Churchill Institute is funded by the Koch brothers.
00:26:31
Like, what is that like? Like what? Like and they also have done a lot of headpieces on campus reform. They think that campus reform is like this also like underground network that also helps spread white supremacy on college campuses. It's it's not so happened. So so after those closed door meetings, we thought that we really were in a position where we actually would get approval. So a few days go by, it's like dead quiet, like nothing's really going on.
00:26:59
You're almost like to the point where it's like, you know, like when it's. Really calm before snowstorm, like you kind of like I'm kind of having that, like I have a gut feeling that something bad is going to happen, but I just don't know what this is. My class registration day. I'm up at like like six thirty in the morning getting ready to go library. It's like my first time doing it on my own because I'm going to be a sophomore and I get a text from my friends being like, dude, look, look at the walls.
00:27:25
It's like what it's like you're all over the walls. They took these these these kids, they took my face from fate. They, like, stalked my social media accounts, got my picture, got I think fifteen other students pictures, put them on a flyer and said the old racism is is every bit as ugly as the new and flyer. They were probably five hundred flyers around campus with my face on it saying that.
00:27:51
Wow. Yeah.
00:27:53
Do you know who was behind it. So yeah. So, so the thing is the Trinity won't tell us they know who was behind it.
00:28:03
Yeah. And did they take any measures that they pulled down that they issue a statement, they send out one of those letters that they send out all the time about tolerance and acceptance. Yes.
00:28:11
So so this is where it gets kind of crazy or actually it actually gets crazier. So so what happened was, is that I met with the deans and I thought that we were on track. They told us that they found the people responsible, that they were going to handle punishment. Usually they sometimes tell you they didn't tell us anything. They said it's all confidential. And I'm like, OK, I wanted to trust the system. I really wanted to kind of follow through with it.
00:28:38
So I kind of let it be. Trinity sent in an email saying that we stand, you know, our community is hurting, that obviously there's a lot of divisiveness on campus. No one should be fired. But, you know, it happened and it was kind of weak. What happened was that a protest erupts, erupted out of that, so a bunch of these students that were probably a part of the firing staged a protest saying that Trinity College administration sides with white supremacists.
00:29:07
And yeah, so then what they did was because obviously, you know, denying US approval is a violation of our freedom of speech. We contacted fire. We had fire involved, the Freedom Individual Rights Association. You know, they outlined a clear case that by the Government Association violated their constitution. Trinity violated their policies by not allowing us to have this club. So obviously, that's like a lawsuit waiting to happen. Right. So Trinity pulled this sort of loophole being like, oh, turns out you never needed to get approval to exist on campus.
00:29:41
So then they let you suddenly exist. Yeah. So you go through this entire period of harassment, bullying. You have to stand up their town halls and just take all of this. And then suddenly they're scared about getting sued and they say, never mind, you're allowed to have your club. You don't need approval. Yeah, I find that to be a really unacceptable conclusion.
00:29:59
I think that it is a really unacceptable conclusion. And then on top, oh, I don't think I understand. But I also got a death threat. It's also weird that I'm so just like, relax about that. That is just like so part of just kind of being conservative in this nature where it's like you're going to get canceled. So you might as well just get it over when you're 22 versus when you're so sad.
00:30:20
It's so, so true. But yeah, but it's just like well now that the earlier the better because they can't cancel you twice.
00:30:25
And I think I can speak from experience. They can't cancel you a thousand times. So you do get over the loop and then you're just able to be yourself.
00:30:32
So there is this anonymous like troll at Trinity and he or whatever they were, they posted. Like, I was a pasty Klansman, and so whatever that means, preppy Hitler was a big name that they were calling me Hitler.
00:30:50
Yeah, preppy Hitler, whatever. It's just crazy.
00:30:54
The third one, which I think is my favorite, this is going along.
00:30:59
This is my favorite one, is that the next leaders of the KKK won't be wearing white sheets or robes, but will be wearing pink shorts and boat shoes.
00:31:07
So, yeah, we'll be dressed quite nice. So but it wasn't me. It was also I mean, we have a ton of, you know, Greek life organizations at Trinity, too. So it was kind of like it sounds like you dress well.
00:31:19
I thank you. I appreciate the Hitler.
00:31:22
Yeah. But using the KKK, it's like they're saying that you dress presentable. Yeah, that's right. Not to be problematic I guess is problematic.
00:31:30
Well, and that's and like you dig deeper into that and you see that it's it's way more than just about books. It is about this cultural difference at Trinity where you have a bunch of just kind of mainstream kids and then a bunch of leftists of all different backgrounds, all different socioeconomic status that just don't feel like they necessarily fit in and they just want to attack you.
00:31:54
How did your parents feel watching you go through all of this and what was going on at school? So my parents were like, this can't be happening. They just were like shocked. And it's weird because I and I think you could talk about, like high school so different where a lot of this doesn't necessarily happen in high school. Like if you're bullied in high school, which, like my mom said, like this is bullying. And I was like, well, it's yeah, it's it's bullying.
00:32:13
Right? So she was like, you know, if this is high school, the kids get caught, the parents know who the kids are and the punishments dealt with. I mean, Triniti just like didn't tell my parents really anything. And my mom was just like, what is going on? Like and she kept on kind of saying, like, what will happen if, like, you know, things were like reverse, like what would happen if if if I.
00:32:35
A conservative student.
00:32:37
Fired around a bunch. We have a socialist club on campus, like, what if I took all the pictures of the socialist kids, fly them around campus and said that, you know, all socialists are are murderers because of, you know, the death rate of socialist countries? I would probably have gotten expelled. Right. Right. So there's no indication what the punishment was with these kids. I even heard a few times off the record that there might not have even been a punishment.
00:33:04
So that's a bigger thing to even look into. But, yeah, I think that this is a prime example of an administration gone rogue. They had no explanation for my parents for what happened. They cultivated basically this sort of insider versus outsider dynamic, a trinity where not only am I being attacked, but kids that dress like me are being attacked.
00:33:25
And, you know, all on top of this, I got fired like with other students, and none of us have got justice.
00:33:34
Well, I think that you should pursue justice. So I'm going to ask you, have you thought about taking this up in the courts?
00:33:40
Yeah, and I think I think that it's something worth talking about. And I think we I mean, there's there's a lot of wrongdoing here. I mean, between freedom of speech violations, between slander. I mean, to call me slander, libel.
00:33:54
I mean I mean everything. And I think that I think it's just sad that, like, this is supposed to be a liberal arts education is supposed to be the place where you're supposed to flourish in terms of what you're learning. And at the end of my freshman year, I was fired, had a death threat.
00:34:09
You were a freshman? I was a freshman. I was a freshman. So this was this was like I'm now going to be a junior. But I was a freshman at the time and like like it just like it was crazy. I, I sometimes I'm speechless about it because it's like, wow, that happened.
00:34:24
Well I mean I personally hope so. And my reasons, I genuinely believe that we're arriving suddenly into a place where conservatives have to become litigious. And the reason for that is because look at what's happening. I mean, we are seeing we have not seen this stuff since the civil rights era in terms of black people fighting for their rights. We are now seeing it happen again for conservatives. I mean, you're not allowed to speak. You're not allowed to read books.
00:34:45
You're not allowed to have a club. You have to hide yourself, hide your friends. You know, I've had so many celebrities that are in Hollywood that message me and say that they can't say that they're conservative or risk losing their jobs on the basis of their idea. This is this is discrimination and discrimination that we never thought was possible political discrimination. On the basis of you being a conservative, you being a college Republican, they think that's, you know, discrimination is OK.
00:35:09
And, you know, you see this sort of tacit acceptance about it from the administration. Yeah. And I don't think we win unless we demand that there are some protections forced at these schools.
00:35:21
And on a federal level, there should be protections in place for conservatives. You should be allowed to be a conservative on campus.
00:35:27
Yeah, and I think that that's a great point. And one of the things I've been trying to do, and I tried to do it somewhat last year and continuing in in is that we are trying to get a free speech bill passed in Connecticut originally was looking at public. But I think I mean, if we can try to expand it to private schools, because here's the situation.
00:35:44
You know, when you're dealing with the federal government, if you have federal laws right in this case, let's say the Bill of Rights and that company is not following with them, what does the government do? They go in and they try to fix the situation. How can that not apply to colleges when colleges are private, colleges are not following and not abiding by freedom of speech and the First Amendment? What are we left with? We're kind of left with a constitutional crisis right now.
00:36:09
Right. And I think that, like, if something doesn't happen soon, like more and more of these things are going to happen as colleges like Trinity was a pretty mainstream conservative college for a long time. And now look at it like it's it's turned into something. I mean, you I wouldn't think that if you look at Trinity now, you would have no idea that like Jesse Waters, Tucker Carlson went there.
00:36:31
I know. I know. It is so sad. I mean, but there are a lot of strong conservatives that have come out of Connecticut.
00:36:36
I'm one of them. Yeah, you're one of them. I was glad to speak at the university, as crazy as it was. And I think it went well, for better or for worse. You went pretty well. They were surprised, you know, one or two crazies in the crowd. But I do I do want to say that this is such an important story because it's not you're not the only person that goes through. This happens all over the nation.
00:36:54
And I wanted to bring this episode to my audience because I just want parents to really be engaged in what's going on. I personally don't think that I would send my kid to school, to university until this gets fixed. I don't I don't believe that we should be funding paying for our kids to be discriminated against. And I think that unless your kid wants to become a doctor, why send them? It's expensive and they're not learning anything anymore. Keep them at home and let them read John Locke.
00:37:18
So we wrap up every episode by allowing you to sort of leave a two minute message for the world. I would love for you to direct one to parents, you know, you know, who are grappling with these questions.
00:37:28
So you're going to look directly at that camera, some to and parents of the world.
00:37:33
All right. All right. On your mark. Get set. Two minutes on the clock world. I give you Nick Engström. All right.
00:37:40
To my parents, first thing, I bet you are all grappling with so much anxiety right now between your kids not being able to either graduate from high school or college with with the covid-19 pandemic wrapping up and with now the idea of you going to school, that your child's not going to be harassed and assaulted because they have a different viewpoint against the administration. I tell you this. I think that look into your school, figure out what's going on. But I think to a broader point of what Candace brought up, and I think what we talk about here is that larger change needs to happen.
00:38:16
You guys have control, you have the money, you're paying the bill. You can demand action that these schools take. These schools are can be held accountable and held accountable by you. And I think that's an important message. Is that you we don't like to talk about this anymore, but parents really do control the narrative. You guys get to choose how to raise your kids, how they act in public and basically produce good citizenship within them that should be able to continue at college.
00:38:43
And it does if you're paying the bill, you have power. And I think you should use that power. I think you should if you think that any of this is maybe happened at the school that your son or daughter is at or might be attending, talk to administration, call them out constantly, be on them, form parents unions, just make it so that it's easier for other kids because this is my story. But there's millions of other like me at every college facing the same struggle and the same things.
00:39:08
And there's some kids that don't usually recover from it as well. I mean, this was pretty intense bullying. So my advice to you is really control the narrative, work hard and you have the money. You have the power. That was excellent.
00:39:25
It was wonderful. Yeah. There you go. You look at that.
00:39:27
