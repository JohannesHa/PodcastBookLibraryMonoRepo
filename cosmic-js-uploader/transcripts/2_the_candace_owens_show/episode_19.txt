00:00:07
Direction, we'll be talking about the Punic Wars next year. I'm a little weak and the Punic Wars, so, you know. All right, you guys ready?
00:00:19
Hmm. OK, ladies and gentlemen, we are rolling into another episode of the Kandace owned show.
00:00:26
Let's just depict D-Day, June six, 1944. A bunch of young boys, the average age was 22 years old. They are trying to get over the English Channel, the riving on four different beaches. And by chance, American soldiers are sent to land on Omaha Beach.
00:00:46
This is when the Germans were occupying France and it was considered a crucial mission to win back France, matching these boys.
00:00:56
The weather was terrible. If you learn it was very choppy and they were actually getting seasick crossing the channel. Many people who survived it talked about how some of the boys were were crying and praying and wanting to go home because they were so sick and because the technology of the ships that they were in wasn't great. They opened too early. And we all know what happens next.
00:01:18
It was really just a slaughter slaughter fest. And you think about the bravery of these boys crossing the English Channel.
00:01:25
It always makes me wonder, would the young American men that we are raising today have been able to complete that mission?
00:01:35
Would they have signed up for the mission?
00:01:37
I say this all the time, but when I go around these American universities and I see kids of that same age, students of that same age, I just do not see see that same bravery, that same heart, that same spirit or that same commitment to American principles and freedom.
00:01:56
And you guys know, my biggest issue, of course, is my fear that American men today are just not men. They look different. They look smaller.
00:02:05
I think about my grandfather's generation. The men just look different when you look back at the photos from World War Two.
00:02:13
And so I had this conversation with the dear friend of mine who I am so excited to had today, and she told me so many interesting facts. And it's I'm not crazy.
00:02:22
It turns out it's not all in my head. We're going to start there and talk about a lot of different topics.
00:02:28
But Jackie, the host of The Jackie Daily Show, welcome to the canceled show.
00:02:34
So good to be with you. I'm so excited you finally came to Dallas for this filming here in my backyard. So welcome you a lot of stuff.
00:02:42
And I also want to mention that you are part of the life powered program at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, which focuses on raising America's energy IQ, which is super important. And we're going to get into. But I want to talk about the conversation you and I had on a plane. And I said to you, my theory that I've been running around rampant with, which is just that there's something going on with the men today. They just don't look like men.
00:03:05
And you dropped some amazing knowledge on me that I said you need to share with the world.
00:03:09
So that was really a repeat of a conversation that I had had in 2007 with a man named Dr. Brend, who is in fact an expert in the impact of hormones on the human body. I meet this guy at a conference and he says to me, Why aren't you married? And I'm much younger at the time. I am married now. I said I can't find many manly men. And he said, What are you talking about? That's my expertise.
00:03:35
He's like, Can you prove that men are less manly today than yesterday? I said, What? I believe my lying eyes. I mean, I can tell by looking right. You can see a difference between men my age versus dad's generation versus grandpa's generation, which is the World War two generation. I was listening to your introduction and I thought you called them boys. I thought back then they be called men. But in fact, you know, you were Barmitzvah when you were 13 thousands of years ago.
00:04:02
You were a man very, very much earlier in life than you are now. Now, he had this, like, Death of the Grown Up, which is name of a great book, by the way, by Diana West. But that's for a later conversation. But it's it's related. It's that these men today and they are technically men don't seem to be as assured, as confident, as aggressive. We had the snowflake culture, the affirmed me culture.
00:04:28
They all cancel you culture. If you do anything that upsets my internal I don't know what view of myself, my world. And it's just not manly. And frankly, I mean, I would say you and I have more testosterone that a lot of these people that we have to go up against, you get so angry. It's almost like Arrested Development, like they throw fits if things don't go their way. And it's I'm kind of making fun of them.
00:04:55
But at the same time, I'm actually being kind of sympathetic because they are genuinely unsure of themselves. And so I talked to Dr. Brind, who was explaining to me is like, you know what? I'm not sure I'm buying your theory. He said, I have these research assistants. I'm going to have them go do a survey of the research and find out, are American men less manly now than they were years before? So weeks later, he calls me.
00:05:20
It's like you won't believe this. There was one study that was really on point longitudinal following people from nineteen eighty seven to about twenty seven. And so they just tested their testosterone levels and then tested them again and found out there was about a 20 to 25 percent drop. And this is not the natural drop that happens with aging that the World War two generation experiences, yet they're still men. We're talking about something different. And so he said, I only thought one study on humans, but many on animals, every kind of animal mammals, birds, fish, big animals, small animals, because it's about dosing, you know, of something.
00:05:58
And he pinpointed the issue as synthetic estrogens, which I didn't know anything about at the time. But I'm working for Congress at the time. And at that time they're thinking about regulating things like assisted reproductive technologies, which is very much the use of hormones to bring about a result and at that time mostly unregulated. And so I was interested I'd like teach me more weight, just describe.
00:06:22
So what is assisted reproductive technology?
00:06:24
Does that IVF or I need to help you have a baby. Mm hmm. And so or even birth control counts, as you know, or hormone replacement therapy or people who are taking hormones to change their sex like anyone who's taking hormones. This would apply to you. That's his specialty. So it turns out he explains to me that synthetic estrogens are all over.
00:06:47
They're ubiquitous in our environment and pesticides, plastics, Vinals cosmetics, soaps, it's everywhere. And most of them are good in that they make us healthier. They're the foundation of modern sanitation. They extend our lifespan. They protected us from covid-19 still do. That's all good. The problem is we we take them in from so many places and no one is paying attention to the cumulative effect of the hundreds of exposures we get to them in different products, water bottles, even your drinking water every single day.
00:07:24
And this is having an impact. And if feminising everyone and everything, men and male animals and now I mean, I started talking to step in Washington and everyone thought I was crazy. I would lose credibility with people. I could just see my own friends doubting me. And I'm like, this is so obvious. Like the antagonistic relationship between estrogen and testosterone. How much testosterone does the man lose before he's no longer a man? And then all the research began pouring in from all over the world.
00:07:55
Now the FDA acknowledges that the EU, Oxford University is publishing research on this. There are international conferences being held on gender bender chemicals. Just Google gender bender chemicals. It'll all come right up. You can see it. And it's just clearly lowering sperm counts around the world. It's why we have infertility problems that we didn't used to have. It's late to breast cancer directly and other cancers because hormones have a direct link to not every cancer, but some.
00:08:25
And so, you know, obesity and in baby boys, this is the worst. These chemicals will cross the placenta to the baby in utero between the second and eighth week. The baby is very vulnerable because you're going through your your cellular organization. Cells are becoming brain cells versus bone cells versus skin cells or whatever. And if you're dosing that baby boy in estrogen every day, what can happen is that he will be born with things like genital malformations now that are that are known.
00:08:59
I mean, this is in the Western world and documented. And you can find it on your own in any, like I said, a simple Google search. And they they then tracked these boys after they tested their mothers exposure from her blood test or a urine test. And they find that later in life they are less aggressive. They are less prone to like rough and tumble play. They say like every aspect of masculinity is impacted by what's happening in the womb.
00:09:27
And so to me, that's that's scary. What does humankind go if men aren't men from the time they're before they're born? So I don't mean to sound critical or unkind at all. This is just factual information. It's I've been sharing this over the years with people and I talked to expectant mothers and I'm like, you know, think about maybe buying Paragon free or phthalate free or BPA free, which is now illegal in the U.S. products. And, you know, I took a lot of flack like stop your mommy shaming.
00:10:01
And I'm like, you know what a mother cares about even more than a momentary, fleeting emotion that's negative. She cares about the well-being of the baby. And why is no one telling this story? And the answer is no one wants to be liable. You know, it's OK to be tested because there's too much it's hot button.
00:10:20
There's too much liability, I think, for the people who sell these products. And like I said, I'm not anti chemical, right? You know, I use chemicals every day. So to you, right. We don't want to live in a world without them. Right. I'm sure of that. So I'm not like I can see the American Chemical Council coming after me now for the things I'm saying. But I just think that we need to do informed consent for the use of products.
00:10:44
People should know that there's a danger to you, that there are things you can do to at least lessen your exposure, especially while you're pregnant.
00:10:51
And it's funny that you say that, like when you when you talk about saying it was just an observation, because to me it's just been observation. There was no science to back it up. I just am looking at people and I'm saying there's just no way that you could have I mean, looking at my grandfather and looking at these boys to come up, I'm like, no, no, no, no. My grandfather had to be like five years old, you know?
00:11:07
I mean, he was working on a sharecropping farm.
00:11:09
So all of these emotions and they're really they feel them. I mean, I don't think this is an act when you see these boys on campus and, you know, they're they're close to tears because they don't understand why you don't acknowledge that there is 37000 gender, you know what I mean? And I'm saying, OK, there's something wrong with this. Right. And and I say similarly, it was an observation for me. I said to people, isn't it weird that we have so many women that are signing up for IVF, so many women that are having fertility issues, so many women that are having difficulty getting pregnant.
00:11:37
Yet just two generations ago, my grandfather, one of 12, my mother one of nine. Right. So what was going on back then that they're kicking out 12 kids? Right. You know what I'm saying? And now we're having people that are a lot of people, so many people that have come forth and said, I'm struggling to have just one and how can we not have a conversation and realize that there has to be something we're contributing that's creating this predicament.
00:11:59
And it actually with the men, they even look different. They look softer, they look more feminine, like it just everything has changed.
00:12:07
And so it's in every product that you have pretty much at home where you can purchase products that are better than others. I mean, I caution anyone buying organic because the labeling can be so misleading. Things that are called if it's a 70 percent organic, that means it's 30 percent. Not for almost anything meets that criteria, right? Yeah. So, I mean, I, I understand there's a lot of funny business in the marketing, in the labeling, so be cautious.
00:12:31
But if you see something that's marketed as no daylight, which is spelled p h l phthalate and no parabens, that's a good start. You know, or even things like open your windows in your house because indoor air is loaded with these chemicals because you're spraying hair spray and perfume or you don't even use perfume, you don't need it. There's some serious or, you know, synthetic estrogens of multiple types in perfumes. When you open a plastic product and you can smell the plastic.
00:13:01
Well, you're you're smelling dailies. You're smelling synthetic estrogen, your estrogen izing yourself at that moment. And so I think it's impossible to totally get away from the problem, but we can definitely make it better. We should at least tell people the truth, because no. One, it's no one's job so far to be on top of the cumulative effect. Every manufacturer has to be accountable to you for the impact of their product alone. But what happens when you use fifteen cosmetics in the morning?
00:13:32
And who knows how many hair care products and who knows, you know, how many pharmaceuticals. All of this is coming in together and no one's paying attention to the cumulative effect. We have to do it ourselves. The government's not going to protect you. Well, you protect the left is going after climate change.
00:13:47
I think conservatives can pick up testosterone change.
00:13:50
That's right. It's an environmental issue. It's an environmental issue. It is like this is like the one issue where I'm allied with the NRDC. What are those groups that I normally don't follow and we're not, you know, cite to for authoritative research. And we're at odds all the time because my show is about energy and environment issues, but they are genuinely and rightfully concerned about this.
00:14:12
And yeah, it's a conservative issue. It's everyone's issue. And so I like I said, I was actually hesitant to talk about this because I've tried in conversations privately with lawmakers, media people, the people in our circles, and a lot of them just don't believe me. And I'm like, why on earth would I make something like this up? It's so obvious. It's basic science, actually. I mean, I'm a lawyer, right? I'm a lawyer.
00:14:39
I'm not like you're not a scientist. They play that card like, fine, you know, Google. I'll say it again, gender bender chemicals and just watch all the scientists come up telling you what we've known for a long time.
00:14:50
But there were no studies on humans that I could find until 2005. So like I said, the testosterone levels were down like twenty to twenty five percent from eighty seven to twenty seven. What if we had started tracking the decline from the very beginning of the introduction of these chemicals into the stream of commerce, which you'd have to go back many, many, many decades? I mean, it depends on what chemical you're talking about, but clearly the 1940s and.
00:15:19
Then what happens is over time, they'll say this chemical is safe. Well, then as time goes on, they concentrate that chemical and make it stronger and stronger and stronger until the studies they're citing don't apply to the chemical we're using today. Right. Especially pesticides, right? Yeah, especially pesticides.
00:15:36
What is going to bring up? Because you told me something very interesting about alligators. Yes. And please repeat that story because I was like, oh, my goodness, this is makes me very nervous.
00:15:44
OK, like Apopka, Florida. It's a Popke. Again, I encourage you to look this up because some of this I won't say explicitly because a lady shouldn't be talking about alligator genitalia to the extent that will be required to tell you every result. But basically, Florida, there are polluted ponds because they're surrounded by farmland. So all of the pesticides washed into the pond and they had ponds over here that are not surrounded by farmland and they test the parts per million of the, you know, the toxin and it's not there.
00:16:15
They compare the alligators from the polluted pond to the clean pond.
00:16:20
OK, the males in the clean pond have significantly larger genitalia than the males in the polluted pond, period. This is like the undisputed it's not just gators. They also might have more hermaphrodites born into the polluted pond. And this is replicated with fish in the Potomac, with roaches, with. So, I mean, pick an animal group. And it's been proven. And a lot of the chemical people who criticize me will say, well, it's really just about dosage.
00:16:51
You know, if you're an adult, it's not that big a deal. It's like, OK, well, guess what? The gator is bigger than me and it's having an impact alligator. Right? I don't know how to compare my daily cumulative consumption of synthetic estrogens. Who does that test to what the gators up against? But look at the dose if anything is big enough, and especially for the embryo, a little teeny embryo, what dose do you need to have a major impact on an unborn child?
00:17:17
Probably not much.
00:17:18
It's funny because you said you said earlier, you know, this is basic science. And actually what we have in this country is an issue with basic science. We have a lot of people that don't know anything about science. And that's why I love the name of raising America's energy IQ is the focus for what you're doing at the life powered program. Right. We seem to be operating at like zero in terms of what people know coming out of school.
00:17:39
Science is not something that is, you know, is really required to graduate high school. I mean, you know, you have to take one or two classes. I mean, you can get a D minus in science and you can still graduate and you know nothing. And so why do you think it's important people to understand what's going on with energy to raise their energy I.Q.? Aside from the fact that we have people that genuinely believe that the world is going to end up ten years?
00:17:59
Yeah, well, I mean, that's an issue, obviously, because that would frame your world view, although I don't believe those people, because if they really believe that they wouldn't save for retirement and they wouldn't, you know, take vitamins, who cares? Right. They start smoking cigarettes and live like there's no tomorrow if they really believed it. But to the point and speaking for myself now and Jacqui, Daily Show and not life power because I can be more broad.
00:18:20
They're like power. It is very you know, it's educational, it's research. It's hard core numbers and data on energy and environment issues. Whereas my show is wide open commentary and I can be kind of bombastic is I want to be.
00:18:34
The reason why I started the show is because I was doing counterterrorism investigations on Capitol Hill informally with my boss there. And you find out that almost all of it was funded by oil and natural gas money. And I'm thinking, how are we ever going to get off of oil? And I thought it was a problem. So I spent literally hundreds of hours studying the history of oil in particular. And first I thought we're going to move to renewables. And I even got in that business for a while.
00:19:06
Well, and then I found out this isn't going to work. The math doesn't work on this. Then I thought it was efficiency. That'll be the new fuel will do everything with, you know, 20 percent of the energy we use now. But that's not going to happen tomorrow. And I realized that the answer to defunding the states that fund terrorism with oil money was the American Fracking Revolution, which brought the United States online as the largest producer of oil and brought the price down so far that those countries can't meet their budgets because they're a one trick pony.
00:19:38
They've got one product really that they export, and that's oil. So when the price of oil tanks, they're facing state failure, they don't have expendable income to to fund terrorism in two other countries around the world as before. So the American fracas is really the answer to bankrupting the funders of terrorism. And so I was so convicted about this and I wanted everyone on Earth to know about it because every piece of coverage I saw about American oil and gas and fracking was negative.
00:20:08
I couldn't find anything positive about it. No one's telling the other side of the story. No one's telling the fact that everything I just said about, you know, what's what's under. Our modern life, like pharmaceuticals, electronics, plastics and Vinals, these are all made from oil, and so, I mean, it fuels 80 percent of our economy and the global economy. And according to any authority I can find, that's going to be true for 20 years.
00:20:38
You know, we're not getting off oil. People like and if you don't believe me, just write to me, message me, hit me with your best shot and I will take it on on my show and I'll explain why that's not going to happen. Right. And so things will change. I mean, I have no idea what someone's going to invent in five years that could transition our energy future. I'm just saying, as if right this second in 2020 and back in 2014 when I founded the show, that was not in the cards.
00:21:07
And so it's just if they don't understand that the nuts and bolts level, they'll believe all kinds of things.
00:21:13
That's right. Exactly right. And, you know, I actually write a theory. I forgot what book I was reading, what they were sort of talking about when America transformed and quite actually was saying pretty much that when America started seeing this sort of birth of the environmental movement and feminism, the feminist movement and, you know, black militancy and, you know, against white supremacy movement, it was actually all around the same time.
00:21:35
And the author, you know, made a I guess was offering a thesis that what really happened and what he saw happen because he lived through it was that America was seen all over the world as the greatest country on earth everybody agreed with in America. There was so much American pride, you know, World War One, World War Two, it was like the greatest country ever. And then he said that in the mid 60s or in in, you know, maybe like 1964, when America formally came out and said, you know, what we are doing to black Americans is wrong.
00:22:02
Right. We were completely got this wrong. We're going to undo this with the civil rights bill. It was the first time America was like, oh, my goodness. Like, this is there's something wrong with our country. We've done something wrong. And the people that were coming up and speaking specifically about the baby boomers and that generation kind of wanted to undo everything that they saw their parents. How could you be a part of this generation that allows segregation to go on?
00:22:23
You know, and they started that that thought process that everything was fundamentally wrong with America. Right. And this is when he says you start to see the birther movements, you know, you see the hippies going out. They want no more war. America was known as, you know, drilling for oil and all these things. They wanted that to be gone and essentially wanted to throw out the baby with the bathwater. I guess, of course, segregation was wrong.
00:22:42
Jim Crow laws were wrong. But all everything that America was doing forever was not, you know, since the beginning of time was not wrong. America was this great country, aside from this, you know, very big blemish they were willing to get rid of. And what's funny is that he talks about this moment, which is a really interesting way to look at it, where he says what's actually supposed to happen in a situation is that a newer generation of kids looks at their parents and they kind of hate everything their parents do.
00:23:05
Right. And you go through this adolescent phase and you're like, I want to be the opposite of my parent. I want to go out. I want to smoke cigarettes. And then you get a little older and you kind of compromise and you realize there's some things I want to change. But there are actually some things that are really good about what my parents did. This was the first time that the generation they were out and they were being adolescent and they were saying, my parents suck.
00:23:24
And the whole world told me they were right. The media told them they were right. There's something fundamentally wrong with American culture. And we've been fighting that that generation which won against their parents who believe that everything that their parents did was irredeemable and needed to be it was backwards, need to be undone. We were still fighting that generation, winning the war, the adolescent war against their parents. And that's what we're seeing today when we look at this environmental lobby and their insistence that, you know, oil and gas, it's also wrong when actually when you're quite educated as you are, you know that we're actually doing a tremendous social justice throughout the world via fracking and V.R. oil production.
00:24:02
Yeah. I mean, there's no way to raise the Third World out of abject extreme poverty without electricity, without energy, transportation, fuel, electricity and petrochemicals, frankly. And the sanitation I was talking about the that I just had like I was so down on, in fact, I mean, clearly I'm actually very pro modern technology, but there's no way that those people ever come out of their circumstances. And I mean, anywhere in the world pick a continent where there's extreme abject poverty that will not change in that corner of the earth until they have full electricity for everyone that's reliable around the clock.
00:24:41
You could run hospitals, you know, intensive care units. You can run schools. Until you have that, you could actually get water out of the ground with electricity rather than having women walk 200 million miles a day for water, as the U.N. reports now. Well, you're not going to get ahead in life if you spend six hours a day walking for water. So the only way to help them is to get that energy there. And as of today, the only way that mankind knows to do that cheaply, reliably, abundantly is with fossil fuels and nuclear energy.
00:25:14
Those are your options, right.
00:25:15
And they won't do nuclear energy. I mean, that ended after Chernobyl. I mean, like the. They won't even discuss it because they don't understand the science behind it, and I was guilty of this, too. I mean, once I started really wanting to be able to combat the climate change lobby, I went and I bought a book and I my mind was blown and I said, how did I go through school? And none of this was taught to me.
00:25:32
Rather, we were forced to watch Al Gore's inconvenient, inconvenient truth and be brainwashed into believing that the polar bears were going ice caps were going to melt, the polar bears are going to die, and global warming was going to be the end of the world that Florida would be under water by now.
00:25:46
Yes, that is what is actually replacing a science education in school. Climate alarmism is really what's replacing it. And we've seen that shift throughout the years and it never goes away. They pick a new at every every 10 years. It seems like they pick something else. There was the the O's, the ozone hole. Right.
00:26:02
There was acid rain, which to me, I think is probably the most traumatizing match being a kid and being told that it's going to rain and acid drops. That was sure that was me.
00:26:10
That's the worst one. I was terrified. I'm so bitter about it, you know, because I read that stupid Wired magazine and they had all this stuff and, you know, getting to the young girls. And I believed it. I was a rabid environmentalist throughout my teenage years. I really because I didn't know any better, I didn't realize that every five or ten years there's a new thing. And then one day you look around, you're like, what happened with the acid rain or what happened with the ozone layer?
00:26:33
Are we not doing that anymore? And then they did the global cooling where they said it was getting too cold.
00:26:37
And I think that was in the 70s. And then my generation, it was global warming and now they've arrived that you know what, we've been proven so many times wrong. Let's just call it climate change. Right.
00:26:44
So it should happen is the beginning of time. So I could never possibly you know, it's a theory that can't be proven false. There is a host here at the Blaze who said or at the place where I am, which says, tell me what it is that we could learn or prove that could ever disprove climate change alarmism. What would it be? What's the piece of evidence they need to know? You know, you can calm down. We have great news.
00:27:09
The world is not ending in twelve years. What is it? There isn't anything because it's not really science. It's not the scientific method subjects itself to testing proudly with confidence that, look, if we're wrong, we want to know we're wrong so we can get to what's right. Right. And they they don't have that confidence and they've even turned things like what people again, once again, people have are operating from a very limited education when it comes to science and chemistry.
00:27:31
And they turn things like carbon dioxide, which is actually a life source into saying.
00:27:37
Yet the carbon dioxide, the carbon dioxide level, carbon dioxide, that's plant food. It's all you people that keep saying that you get you that you love trees and there needs to be more plants. Don't realize that they they survive off of carbon dioxide. You know, in a more limited carbon dioxide, there can't be plants. And I don't know. Yes, they don't realize that if you look across the charts, you look at all the countries.
00:27:54
There's actually we're going through a period of tremendous greening and vegetation country who could never, never had vegetation, now have that. And so they're operating from just such a negative perspective because they have no knowledge, there's no basic science being taught, which allows them to get on the hook for climate alarmism, just like you were when you were young. And me too. I was actually I thought global warming was real.
00:28:16
I thought the polar bears were going to drown. And now I've learned that the polar bears are actually more populated than they were then. And it's just interesting how much power that lobby has in America. And the only we're going to combat it is through education. Right. So nothing I want to talk to you about because I had mentioned it to you this morning and I told you that we had someone on this show, Timbaland Operation Underground. And you know, where I have always considered myself to be a person that's pro freedom and live and let live.
00:28:45
I guess you could say that sort of a libertarian perspective. It doesn't harm me. Then who cares? But one of the things that we don't talk enough about in America and in speaking with Timbaland about sex trafficking, I realize is that it may not be harming you immediately, but you may be having a horrible consequence across the world.
00:29:00
And America is one of those countries which we don't produce certain things, but we are actually the biggest consumers of it. And having this conversation with him about sex trafficking transformed my opinion about pornography, you know, understanding that they do this, they sex trafficking because they will create content. And we are the people in America that are eating up all of the content that they're creating, which made me think this is unconscionable. I can no longer, you know, support, support or I say support.
00:29:25
I mean, say live and let live. And I'm now adamantly opposed to pornography. The same can be true instead of drugs. You know, you talk about people talking about, oh, the Mexican drug laws are so horrible. The Colombian drug lords are so horrible. Well, who are they getting it, too? We are their number one clients. We are the consumers of drugs. I mean, it's not just fascinating to consider America as the number one consumer of things that are so horrible.
00:29:48
Well, and it reminds me of a video you made where it shows, you know, we are the problem. America, like I love my country. You know, I'm very no one tears up faster than me when the flag goes up. And I'm I'm a total patriot. I love my country. We have to be honest. We are a human institution, this government and its people. And so we have flaws. We do some things wonderfully and better than anyone else.
00:30:11
And there are some things that aren't good. And one of them is what happens when you have a permissive culture.
00:30:19
With pornography, I mean, I got briefed on this in Congress, there's it's not as simple as you think it is because people don't look at the same images all the time. We actually know from brain science that they want more and more and there's a little piece of the population that is deviant. And they will seek out things like videos that are pornography of people being hurt, injured or killed in the porn, snuff, porn or pedophilia, little children being harmed.
00:30:46
And when we are permissive, this this will inevitably come to pass and it has come to pass. And sex trafficking is actually huge in Texas. It's supposed to be a six hundred million dollar business annually in Texas because literally we have this porous border and where illegal things move like drugs, people move with it. Human trafficking and contraband go hand in hand is the same people in the same locations. They come in through Texas and other places. And there's actually a thriving business here in Texas.
00:31:16
And the average age of the victim, according to the Dallas Morning News, is 13. Wow. This is happening right down the street. I promise you, some child is being raped. And I'm so sorry to be negative and dark, but this is so important for us to understand. Everyone should know this and not close their eyes to it. So it's a bipartisan issue. I mean, I've seen lots of Republicans and Democrats work together to try to put a stop to it.
00:31:41
But we need to be honest about the cause. The demand for the product is here. It's among us. You probably know people who are part of this and you don't realize that they have to be all around you. That's a six hundred million dollar business just here in Dallas. Being a capital of it, we have to take responsibility for the porous border. First of all, like we need to shut down letting this come in from outside the country.
00:32:09
We still have some of it there would be manageable, I think, but also just knowing that we think there are victimless crimes. You know what? Maybe the dehumanization of a woman as a form of entertainment isn't a great form of entertainment. Maybe there are consequences and fallout from that. The commoditization of a woman or have sex, you know, or. I think it cheapens sex and marriage and and the institutions that really are the basic fundamental building block of the society, the family.
00:32:40
Right. How can it not be destructive to the family? In the same briefing, they said, look, if a man looks at a, you know, super hot woman in a pornographic film and then another and then another and then another, guess what his wife looks like less attractive. By contrast, after that, just like if you're driving a Chevette and you see lots of Cadillacs go by, you're going to prefer the Cadillac, even if it's not.
00:33:04
You know, in this case, these images are often not even real. Right now, they have all kinds of ways to actually make women who don't really look the way they look. And, you know, there's a lot you can do with film and photo shops and whatever. But the point is it harms human relationships, the most important relationships, and almost no one wants to talk about it.
00:33:23
Right. And you know what? You can actually pivot and say beyond pornography, we're actually creating a culture of pornography. When you think about Instagram, I mean, I go through Instagram and I am shocked to see the things that I see of what women put on the Internet. And it's not even about, you know, men treating women like that. It's women doing it to themselves. You know, this is what they believe to be sexy. I mean, our culture in America has shifted to one that is all about sex.
00:33:47
And this is largely due to feminism. Right. This whole idea of like, again, want exact same time frame we're talking about where they want to undo everything. Well, you know, in that time frame, throughout the 50s, you know, women were were wearing poodle scoot poodle skirts, pardon. And they were always dressed from head to toe. Same for the men. They were wearing suits all the time. Well, apart part of throwing out the white American culture was was also saying this is sexual oppression.
00:34:10
And this was really kind of brought this whole idea of sexual oppression. And your inner libido was brought to us by by Freud. Right.
00:34:16
And people sort of perpetuating this idea that, you know, if you can release your sexual your inner sexual libido and all of these things, you'll be less of a bigot.
00:34:25
Honestly, this is the kind of stuff that they were writing, right? It's because you're you're sexually repressed. That's what makes you a racist. That's what makes you this. And we sort of gave birth to this post, this culture of, well, let's take it all off. Right. This is us being free. This is us being sexually free. And now I look around and I'm like, you can you can watch porn without ever logging on to a porn website.
00:34:43
You can watch my go on Instagram. Yeah, right.
00:34:45
I mean, girls barely just what's legal. I mean, hashtag free the nipple women upset that they can't put their they can't show their breasts on Instagram yet. Men can be at the you know, can show themselves that a shirt like this is very different. You know, seeing a man that is not the same effect as seeing a woman that that has her boobs out and they pretend they don't understand that and they're calling that, you know, an injustice, a social injustice.
00:35:08
So I think that the most women listening would hear us as moralizing or preaching or judging or something. But here is the way that you get through, I think, to them is to say this is really about love. Everyone wants to be loved. Everyone longs for a relationship like it, historically, a marriage, and hopefully still where you have commitment, you can rely on it. You know, it's there. It's based on something you're real, not something superficial.
00:35:37
That age is out and it doesn't really matter in the long run, when you cheapen a woman or women, you look around. I mean, the proof is in the marriage and divorce rate. And my grandmother's generation, they didn't have all this. But you look around, I can think of so many women in her generation, her friends, our neighbors who had their husbands right there with them every step of the way till the day they died.
00:36:02
How many of us are going to have that this generation? And I think it's directly related to cheapening women, sex and marriage. And I think all of this just plays into that. So I would say this, young women, why are you doing that? Are you trying I mean, do you want attention? Do you want love? Do you think you're going to get love this way, that you're going to find a quality man who's going to bite on that that photo and and he's going to be the right guy, you know, because they just can't see.
00:36:31
It's almost just the way that the teenagers are, right. Their brain isn't even fully formed yet. They can't anticipate cause and effect.
00:36:38
But you get to them by saying, please think about being loved, put that first and and make that the most important thing, because I think they don't understand that they're they're damaging all of our chances that womankind chances of having successful relationships when it's so cheap. It is.
00:36:58
It's so cheap and it's so free and it's so out there and in married women, I mean, it's a marriage. I do the exact same thing now and and I get it, I think you're right, I don't want to sound like, oh, we're being the morality police, you know what I'm saying? But I do think it's harmful over time. And it definitely is harmful relationships. And there are so many young women when you ask that question, what are you doing it for?
00:37:16
And I'll see that. What is she actually posting this picture for? I'll think that in my head. Right. And if it's for attention. Right, if it's because you're hoping a guy is going to slide into your DMS, do you think this guy is going to be a committed, faithful person? Right. Because he slid into your DMS because you were half naked. Do you think this is the person that you want to marry? Right.
00:37:33
And no, the answer's no. Right. You want you want security. What you want is you're doing it because you're insecure. Yeah. Yeah, right.
00:37:40
And this is not the way to become secure. This is not the man that's going to make you feel secure because he will look for the next young thing that's posting half of her body on Instagram. And I just worry that we we have you know, we've gotten to a point in society where I can't imagine how we could become more sexualized and we already are. And a part of that is put into the school system. I was reading a TOMMASEO book about it.
00:38:01
It's called Inside the American Education School System. And he talked about how again, after the 1950s, they began teaching sex ed sex ed prior to teaching sex ed people. There was this whole idea of like, well, people are having sex anyways. Well, actually, the statistics prove they weren't having sex anyways when they would do have to answer, you know, are you a virgin? I don't remember the exact statistics, but it was extremely low.
00:38:24
People were graduating high school, their virginity at a high rate. Even the ones that didn't have the opportunity when they graduated were only having sex once or twice. It wasn't like, you know, having a bunch of different partners. And since then it's gone up. And where was that? He was doing he was talking about a study that was done in nineteen. It's like 1955 before the birth control pill, basically. Yes. And then they started saying and that's exactly we talked about birth control pill.
00:38:46
He said it was actually they funded sex education like, you know, and getting into the school system. The teacher said you can take the birth control pill and it's actually contributed to a more promiscuous society.
00:38:57
Right. We allow the time it's funded, you know. You know what I'm saying?
00:39:00
And so big business, it's a huge business. And Planned Parenthood being one of the big profiteers. And the problem is it sells the false message that this means you can have sex without consequence, right? Well, you can have sex without one consequence, which is an unplanned child. What about all the rest of them? What about the diseases? But most importantly, what about your emotional health? What about your spiritual health? You know, a lot of young women feel hollowed out because they've been used and dispensed with by men, and that's hard to heal.
00:39:34
And so I don't know if they link the promiscuity, that permissiveness to that. Right. But it's almost impossible for them to imagine a healthy relationship with a man. And it's it's epidemic. I mean, this is to the point. I feel like there's such antagonism between the sexes. Sometimes there are these camps of women who hate men and camps of men who hate women. And it's all based on a lot of bad experiences that I think we didn't have as many of before the sexual revolution.
00:40:06
Right.
00:40:07
Right. Sex revolution was so toxic. And now you get so many young women and they say, you know, men don't respect women. And my answer to that is that do we do do women give men something to respect? Right. You give men, it's up to you. It's totally up.
00:40:20
It's I'm going to say it's up to women. I'm going to say women hold the line. It is society. We are the civilizing force. I mean, look, I'm pro man. I just happen to know that many of them will take what they can get right. And there are women who will take what they can get in a different way. And so you have to hold the line even if you're the last human being on Earth who subscribes to this idea?
00:40:43
Who gives a flying monkeys behind about your own integrity being exclusive, not available to anyone who wants to click on your profile. You are exclusive. You are special. You are to be preserved. You're not to be given away. You're not a commodity. You're not you're not going to be thrown in a trash can write a magazine. You know, you are a human being. And so I swear, I think it all comes back to teaching women to love themselves.
00:41:09
I really think it's there. And and having hopefully a mother to teach you that and a father to teach you that is important. I think the breakup of the family and the fatherless families impact men and women differently.
00:41:24
And for women, they can be far more susceptible to a society that says, please give us you for free, whereas daddy won't let that happen. Right.
00:41:35
It's funny that you say that and you mention how important parents are, because in that same book, inside the education system, the inside the American education system, he talks about how now the the objective of the education system is largely to undermine parents. And he actually puts in certain homework assignments. What they're named sounds fine. If you're a parent, look at yourself like, oh, this is fine. You know, whatever your family discussions, whatever it is.
00:41:59
And then they'll actually ask students, like, you know, if.
00:42:03
Who's one person in your house that's really gotten you angry and they tell them that this is a safe, safe space, we're never going to repeat these assignments. What's one thing that your parents told you that you shouldn't tell anybody? Right. And then he actually quotes these books as sex ed books saying, like, the old you know, the old guard of like your parents may tell you this and that, but that's not true. Like, sex is hip.
00:42:23
And I'm thinking, oh, my goodness. Right. Like, it's just conditioning that there's something wrong with your parents idea. Is that same thing of like you are, you know, you're in control, you're the adult, you know what's right and you know what's wrong. And totally dismissing the authority of the parents at home, which is so problematic. And so many parents don't know this and they need to know this. And it's hard to know this.
00:42:41
Even if you are a person who's a total hawk and you're reading your children's assignments, they're able to cleverly mask it, like with just these blanket names. And you think, oh, that's great, my child taking a diversity course. Meanwhile, you've got like a trans person coming to read, you know, coming to read them story time or a drag queen coming to read them story time. And that that's part of the problem that we have in this society.
00:43:03
Well, and I'm asking myself, why are we even doing this? Why would a school even intend to do this when they clearly don't have the time or energy to teach them reading, writing, arithmetic? I mean, I am shocked by the people I have hired over the years younger than me who can't spell and they have college degrees. I mean, you're looking around. You're like there's something wrong with the education system. How can they be graduating after, what, 16 years of school?
00:43:31
And they don't have fundamental skills? I think it's because they're spending a lot of time indoctrinating them and separating them from the people who who love them the most, their parents. There's no substitute for the parents in anyone's life. That's why I see a lot of these social programs that I'm kind of skeptical.
00:43:48
Like I know we're trying to do a good thing by throwing money at a problem, but you cannot replace love between human beings the most basic level. And that's what these programs are trying to do. And you see them from both the Republicans and Democrats, charities and just a lot of programs you want to scale and and try to be the daddy in a home. And you're not going to be until we we we reunify the family and hold it together and men start showing up and being men and being fathers, which I think requires testosterone.
00:44:23
Where I started getting a little bit of testosterone. Yeah. Then I don't see this turning around. So so these kids need it. And I think we have to talk about it in terms of love, because everyone knows these these angry people out on the street, Chadda rioting, whatever the angry feminists. The truth is, I think there's a huge hole in there that's not being filled and that's why they're not they need to be affirmed constantly. They're so fragile.
00:44:50
They need to be assured all the time. They can't endure any disagreement. Where is this fragility coming from? There's there's something missing inside.
00:45:00
I think you're right. And I think fragile is actually the perfect adjective of what I see when I see these college kids.
00:45:05
I'm like, I feel like if I went, you just fall apart. If I just blew a little air on, you just come apart. And that fragility is bizarre. It's something that is new. So if you guys are watching this, no synthetic estrogen, I mean, or at least limit it at the very much I told you I wasn't crazy. These are met. These men are boys are looking differently. Their features are softer. They're much more fragile.
00:45:28
They're much more emotional. And something's definitely going on. Pick up a book. Make sure your children are actually learning science so they can combat some of the lunacy that we're seeing on the left. Jacki, thank you so much for coming on the show. We actually wrap every episode by allowing you to leave a two minute face message with the world, with whatever message you think is important for everybody to hear. You're going to speak directly into that camera and you can say whatever you want.
00:45:50
Are you ready? I'm ready on your mark. Get set, world. I give you Jackie, the host of The Jackie Daily Show. Thank you so much.
00:45:57
Qantas Airways is so good to be with you. And I rarely ever say anything in two minutes or less. This will be really tough. But I think that I talk about energy and environment issues on my show, The Jackie Daily Show. But what we talked about today is actually perhaps far more important. And it's about the human family and it's about love. It's about solving problems. And I sound like a hippie. I promise you, I'm not.
00:46:19
If you listen to me for five minutes on my show, you would know that's not where I'm coming from, but it's really the single most important thing of everything else. We talk about it. We spend far too little time talking about what really matters. It's human beings and human relationships. And so now that I have that out of the way, the single most important thing you feel yourself spiritually, that's what really counts.
00:46:40
Beyond that, I have a mission and that is raising America's energy IQ on The Jackie Daily Show on The Blaze. I'm easy to find. Just Google it and podcast everywhere. Find me on Twitter at Jackie Daily Show, on Instagram and on Facebook. Thank you so much.
00:46:56
That's a wrap. Yeah, that was awesome. Thank you so much. Of course. Thank you guys for watching the latest episode of the Kandace own show, I hope you guys enjoyed the conversation as much as I did.
