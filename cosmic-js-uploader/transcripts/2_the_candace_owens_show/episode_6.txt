00:00:07
Them being known, me and being to be I think they just feel like they can't come at me the same way because I'm really a street person. Yeah.
00:00:16
All right. You ready to start? OK, ladies and gentlemen, we are rolling into another episode of the Candace Owens Show. I will be honest and I will say for the first time in my political career, I have been feeling pessimistic about the black community. I jumped into this space feeling optimistic, feeling like there was change that could be implemented if we were willing to have the tough conversations. When I look up at the world today and I see these protests and I see these riots and I see who and what is at the center of these riots, when I see black businesses being burned down, when I see black criminals being murdered, and when I see black athletes and black celebrities and black community leaders sanctioning this violence in our community and remaining mum on the larger instances of violence in our community, I wonder if black America will ever get ahead.
00:01:13
When I sit down and I think by myself about why we ended up in this predicament, I always come up with the answer of culture. What is black culture? How is it impacting black America? Is it for the better or is it for the worse?
00:01:28
Here to discuss all of those things with me is a first and foremost a personality. If you are not following online, he goes by the moniker King The Face. Welcome to the Candesartan Show.
00:01:39
Thank you for having me, Kingfisher's. Also, for those of you that are listening, he is one of my black city ambassadors. He speaks to the black community and by himself, he is the founder of something called the Dad Project, which stands for Developing American Dreams. There's so much that we need to get into. And I could go off on a tangent here.
00:02:01
Just give us your take on what's happening right now with Black Lives Matter and all of these protests and riots.
00:02:07
I mean, I just think is a it's in a sense a test to see who they can control. And we can't black lives matter if we use the emotions of black people in order to get their agendas to be pushed. And I've noticed that, like everything is emotional. It's like everything you got cop shooting somebody and they put this certain narrative and what that does in our community, it builds fear. And once you're afraid of something, especially with officers who you suppose feel safe around and they keep pushing that narrative, people are going to now be put in more positions to have those things happen because that's how they make their money.
00:02:43
That's how they get their exposure is to the death of black men. They don't get it from actually. You know, affecting black lives at all. Nothing is about Black Lives Matter that has to do with any black lives. If somebody could show me when they've been around to actually prevent these joyful incidents, as you would say, from happening, then I could look at black lives like it's a positive thing. But they're not doing that. They only come around election time.
00:03:13
They only come around when a black, black, dead man gets killed by a cop as white or perceived to be white. And they use that to actually you use that to destroy our strength within ourselves. Like them is like wearing a mask is killing their immune system, is weakening us more and more and more and more and more and more.
00:03:34
So then you look at it like. Now, I could get them because they are really broken now, even with this Geoffroy situation, there's people that usually don't care about that. Stuff that I've noticed was like, you know, it has messed up to the point where they're praising them. That's why when people say, oh, you agree, we can just love like, yes, we have to stop praising these type of people and Black Lives Matter.
00:03:56
That's all they ever push. I've never seen in my life if if this exists, then I want to see a kid going to school on his business. You know, getting good grades, no record, getting shot by a cop. Is it a coincidence that everybody that shot by a cop has a bad record, so even people like you, George Ford, I'm like and you said it's so perfect. I'm like, wow, it makes so much sense.
00:04:25
How what about that woman who put the gun to her stomach? What do you think she's going to do right now? It's like you guys are making him like the greatest guy on earth, and he's probably one of the worst, you know, especially a pregnant woman like, come on, you have to have some kind of morals no matter what crimes you're involved in. Because when I grew up, it was no women, kids. If you're dealing with somebody that is men or men, kids and women, I will leave you.
00:04:49
You see, you walk even in the street like we see you walking with your baby or your wife. You got a passion right now. I catch you on the rebound, right, there's there's a level of respect for women and children and that has been written into the culture of not just America, but all societies for a very long time. Women or children are seen as the most vulnerable. And when you see a pregnant woman and this is all I could think about, you know, reading that story of she gets a knock at the door and somebody is pretending just the plotting that went into this, you know, pretending to be a part of the water department.
00:05:21
And by the time she opens the door and realizes something is wrong and she tries to force it shut, you have George Floyd, who, by the way, is monstrous in size.
00:05:29
I believe he's six seven one six, seven. I heard everything.
00:05:32
I think the character, he's six, seven, very, very big, you know, kind of muscular, very muscular forces his way inside the pregnant woman, she's home alone, takes the barrel of his gun and put it to her stomach. His friend Pistol whips her and they robbed her place. They took her wallet. And it's not like this was one incident that happened. And it was, you know you know, that was back when I was under I know that was the ninth time that he went to prison.
00:06:01
It is really hard to go to prison nine times.
00:06:04
And I'm a person who believes in second chances. I know you do, too. By the way, I want to get into also your story so that we're not, you know, thinking that this is people that think people can't make a mistake. They can people can make mistakes.
00:06:14
I've made a lot of are, but not too crazy to go to jail. Right. Right.
00:06:19
Have you been to prison nine times? No, that's that's a record. That's got to be some sort of a record. And what does it do to the psyche of a child when you pretend that this person is just, you know, an ultimate victim, a hero?
00:06:34
They were calling him a hero. Did you hear the eulogy? I mean, you would have thought this person spent his whole life dedicated to God and just trying to uplift his community when in fact he was terrorizing it? Mm.
00:06:46
I know a lot of people that terrorize a community and stay positive things. So my thing is why we didn't give that same energy to Nipsey Hussle. That's exactly right. He was actually doing serve his community.
00:06:57
Despite that he was a part of a gang. He still said, yo, you know, I still want to build my community. I want to make what Krip is about, really stand for something. Same thing with the blood thing. You know, I'm a former blood member. You know, I'd rather not say a form of blood. I'd rather say a former gang banger because there's a difference, because really what blood is about when you when you look at it is brotherly love, overaged oppression and destruction.
00:07:22
So that's what I believe is the same thing with Crips, you know, community revolution and process. So when you look at these things, these was always created to benefit and help our community. It wasn't about destruction. It is about protecting our community. It was about making, you know, doing the right things. But in due time, it became something destructive. But at the same time, you got to look and see how. So who comes from that?
00:07:48
A gang culture that said, you know what, I want to help save lives. I want to teach my community how to build. He started building so much in his community and it's like that man gets his life taken from another person, has evolved with the same gang. So when I when I see this, I'm like, why I got to act like this when Nipsy died? You should have been taking up everything because he was actually building a community.
00:08:13
You guys live in Yashida up not to bring violence into it, but that dude should have been killed immediately. But nothing happens. But then a Jewish law dies who's not a member of society. And he's being praised like some kind of hero, like, listen, I understand he died in a horrible way. It was messed up. We're not going to deny that. But to praise him as somebody like he was good, no. The thing that we keep ignoring is complying.
00:08:45
Like comply, what is so difficult with that, it's so difficult with respect, what's so difficult about that? When I get pulled over by a cop, I don't automatically get nervous everybody else because I know I have nothing in my car. The most I could do is get a ticket. Now, how could I avoid a ticket just in case? Just being respectful as possible when it comes for me, especially when I wrote all my windows down, turn all the lights on in the car, take my key, put it on a car.
00:09:13
I put my hand on the steering wheel when they come, you understand the fear that they have as an officer if they if they are approaching the car. It didn't happen many times that the news don't talk about. They get shot as soon as they walk up to the window. Because they don't know what they expect. That's why even now, you see cows will be nervous, they'll walk walking like this because they don't know what to expect. But if I turn all the lights on, windows down, my hands on the steering wheel, keep on top of the roof, he knows that.
00:09:40
He knows what's going on in my car. He knows there's nobody else in it. He knows I'm not going anywhere and he knows I don't got no weapon to do anything to because my hands on the steering wheel, they come comfortable. They in their energy automatically shifts. So even if they feel like it's going to be one of those sketchy calls, the energy shifts like, OK, they respect me, they will hide. Officer, they'll like I said, sure, I don't have to go.
00:10:04
Well, we will be over for what? Will you do it because I'm black. Yeah.
00:10:08
And that's the automatic first thing that comes to mind. But this is what they're being programmed to think. And I'm like, that's dangerous, because when you're nervous, you might make a move that you shouldn't make. And cops is just as scared, if not more than you. They deal with this every day. So they might especially now this climate is like you can get shot. So teaching our kids fear and stuff like that, we have to be more on teaching them how to prevent it from happening.
00:10:36
And I have a respect for the job that they're doing and respect your life, comply. The more you comply, you're giving them excuses. And there's going to be justice for all of these cases. When cops get off, people don't know the full story because then there's what is a he's resisting like now they're coming out the footage showing that George was resisting white and they kept saying that.
00:10:58
I said there's we're missing a big part of this footage because you see him get out of the car and then he's apparently against the wall. And then suddenly the next thing that we possibly see is the nine minute video. Something obviously happened. And when these toxicology reports came back to show that he was on fentanyl, I like to people understand fentanyl is fentanyl will literally make you stop breathing.
00:11:17
I mean, fentanyl is is the most deadly drug that you could possibly put into your system. There are constant overdoses. You know, my friend who's a surgeon was saying he he said to me that I give this to my patients. Is it they're barely breathing. But, you know, when you give them so when he said he can't breathe, he's not lying. If he's on fentanyl, you know, and he could have not been able issues breathing before the cops even arrested him.
00:11:38
And I'm not saying that this cop was any way justified. He's not. But this is a discussion to have fentanyl, right, 100 times stronger, more potent than morphine. I mean, have you I mean, I had to get morphine in the hospital. You don't feel anything, right? This guy is taking this casually as he's going into a store with, you know, with a counterfeit bill. You know, you hear the nine one one call and the woman is saying, this guy, something's wrong with him.
00:12:03
He's on something. And we're pretending this was a person, as you said, that was just walking down the street, you know, trying to get to school, trying to get to his class.
00:12:12
And here, here, here we are being hunted by cops. How difficult is it to comply? How difficult is it to not go to prison nine times? How difficult is it to not be high holding a counterfeit bill? Don't have the cops call them you don't put yourself in any circumstance close to that. And people have a hard time having that conversation because it centers around respect. And I think the black community has a very hard time with respect.
00:12:36
In fact, we're a very disrespectful community. We celebrate being disrespectful or anti-establishment. If the police right. Call call the female females bitches. Right. How how how can our youth flourish when we're teaching and promoting and celebrating and applauding disrespect? Disrespect is rioting. Disrespect is burning down a neighborhood that had nothing to do with George Floyd. Disrespect is killing a police officer that has nothing to do with George Floyd. And we don't have celebrities standing up and saying it's wrong in our community.
00:13:09
I mean, of course they wouldn't because certain people that they're dealing with any want to look cool of the market. For the Hispanic community, everything is about being cool. That's what I tell people. I don't want to be cool because this area what is cool is too destructive. I don't want to be cool. If that's the case, let me be the most uncool person possible. And I've become that because I'm vocal and open about how I feel about certain things.
00:13:33
Like I said, even we are very vocal about it because I know that it's a part of the problem. Jay-Z could tell people not to wear Jersey anymore and put on a button up and people do it the same way. Now, when you look at it, we don't have like you mentioned it earlier, at least he was even to the music, even though he talked about his past and his life, at least he still kind of gets some positive things into the music now was just two drugs, you know, get high, shoot people like I do.
00:14:00
And I'm like because even in Brooklyn right now, when you look at the crime rate is going up in Brooklyn, we've had the other day there was literally ten, seven shootings in ten minutes. Like into my different areas in Brooklyn, so it was like what did what influence that when you look at the lifestyle of Chicago? We don't look into the whole drill music. And as soon as that we got that into our community.
00:14:25
The gang violence shot up extremely. But it's all about being cool, as are you willing to die to be cool.
00:14:33
It's so funny you say that because so I was just telling you offline that I added an addendum to my book on culture and I literally said, black America has a problem with wanting to be cool. I use the exact word and there's a quote in that chapter that I want to bring up, which was a quote that was written by Confucius, who was a Chinese philosopher. I think it was like he was a Chinese philosopher from 440 B.C., I mean, long time ago.
00:14:56
And he said if one should desire to know whether a kingdom is well governed, if its morals are good or bad, the quality of the music will furnish the answer. And when I read that quote, I instantly thought about black America. And I think the quality of the music right.
00:15:12
What you're putting in your ear is going to tell you whether or not the morals in this community are good and bad. And I talked about the irony that, you know, today people will say they have this concept of what acting black is. Right. And that this is what it means to be black. And you, therefore, Canice, are not black because you're speaking proper English. Right. Because you're not interested in having fights. You know, you don't have baby, you know, baby daddies and all this stuff going on.
00:15:37
And the thing is, as I say, actually, I'm very black. I just don't recognize this decade of being black. And this is not what black was in the 1940s. This is not what black was in the 1950s. This is not when my grandfather was listening to music. The number one song was The Temptations, My Girl. Right. And I write about this in the chapter, the first words of my girl. I got sunshine on a cloudy day.
00:15:56
And when it's cold outside, I've got the month of May.
00:15:59
And then I looked at the top song right now in Black America, and it's making the stallion and Beyonce. And the first lyrics are like, I'm that bitch, I'm this bitch. And I'm thinking, this happened in the span of 40 years, right? 40 years. So what happened to black culture?
00:16:18
And I mean, that is what happened to black culture, because once it became like you have to live a certain type of way now, it was like there's no other way to live is like and we congratulate stupidity in the black community. Like the more stupid you are is like, yeah. And I you was like white and kids didn't want to grow up going to school because going to school you became a nerd is like they don't respect you like oh look at you.
00:16:43
You could just tell even when it comes to like even when it comes to like people coming home from jail compared to somebody that's coming home from college, you see the difference in love and respect. And you know who gets it, the guy that comes home from jail. But the guy that just came busting his ass to college for years, not getting no sleep, having to pop pills like that, not your drugs that keep them up for them to keep, you know, going to school, going to be working all these things.
00:17:13
They make it happen. And the next thing you know, they come to the hood like, yo, I just got my degree. Oh, that's what's so bad about you. I said, the guy that gets locked up comes home from jail. You'll lose ten Statesboro, you know, I mean, get yourself together, man. It it it it. Get back on the block.
00:17:29
That is it like and I'm like, why didn't, why wouldn't I give that ten thousand dollars to the guy that just finished college. You might have some student loans. He might need that help because if you put him in a position of power, making sure he's good, he'll have more incentive to come back to the hood and say, yo, I want to help build some because of my success, you guys supporting me from when I was going to school.
00:17:49
But it it doesn't happen like that. They push those people away from the community is like every time I try to help these fools, they keep attacking me. You know what them they can stay with it and then they'll be like, oh, he's acting different. Like, no, you people are not realizing which are doing it. People mentally, especially with these young kids, if you're telling them that all you have to have a certain sticker on and you have to have certain disown or you're not going to be accepted like you said, you you got to talk in a certain type of vernacular.
00:18:21
Is that the word? Because I'm a really big on phonics, you know, whatever.
00:18:24
In order for you to seem like you're like you're cool. But at the same time, even for me, like, that's why I connect with a lot of them because I speak like them. I'm not great with grammar and all that extra. So some people tell me words like, what does that mean and what does that mean when at the same time I grew up in that.
00:18:41
So I understand why they react like that. And that's dangerous for our community. It's not good if you can see the education of us going down, down and we're in a time where what is this? You can't do you have access to everything. You have literally everything in your hand I carry all day. But you're free to be on Instagram, right?
00:19:01
Right. It's so true. And I want to go back to what you just said about, you know, that moment where you have you're a person who could be from the hood and you're becoming more and more successful. And the more successful you become, the less of it one. Anything to do with you and this is so tragic and it reminds me of when I was starting early on, I, you know, was able to have a conversation with a very well known and respected black conservative.
00:19:23
And he warned me, he said, you're going to get to a point where you're just going to be done with done with the community. Right. Because you're you're going to realize, OK, fine, keep it the way you want. And I'm just and you're going to say I'm going to go be successful by yourself. Right. And I can imagine that that has happened to so many. I mean, think about people that like Condoleezza Rice.
00:19:41
Right. This woman started her life living in a real racist America. Right. And she talks about that. I mean, you can't say this woman is not black, but you do, right?
00:19:51
You sit here, you say Clarence Thomas stuff like they grew up in segregated America. You say they're not black because they became successful.
00:19:58
You know, he's the the second, I think, black Supreme Court justice ever. You know, you don't you don't celebrate him. You cited he's not black. And there are so many Dr. Ben Carson. I mean, he survives almost every purity test. You talk about him.
00:20:11
He grew up in a single parent home in a poor neighborhood in Detroit. His mother wasn't literate.
00:20:19
He went to a school and was bullied for being black, you know, because he somehow ended up being able to go to a white school.
00:20:24
His whole story is what fell in love with a black woman, you know, at Yale married her.
00:20:29
He still married her. And you have stripped him away of his blackness.
00:20:32
Why? Why? Right. And so if that's what it means to be black. Right, what it means is you have to pretend to be uneducated. You have to speak broken English. Who wants to play that? Eventually you say, OK, you know what? I'm done with this. I've tried. I've tried my whole life. And they have I mean, they tried their whole lives to help the black community and we just rejected them. We said their Uncle Tom's and their cousins and their race traitors, what are they what are they betraying?
00:20:59
A broken culture, showing the positive side of our culture. They're showing. And to me, that's an insult. Like what makes you think we can't talk proper, right? What makes you think that just because we come from somewhere, we can't make it happen? It's the same thing when I wore my Magga and people made me famous for it, I'm like, I shouldn't be famous for wearing a mega hat. That's insulting to assume that a black person doesn't think for themselves because that's really what it came to like when people who were, you know, why are you supporting me?
00:21:29
And I'm like, because I have my own mind and I want the best. I don't care who gives us the best. As long as we are able to create solutions. What else matters? You think I can't think for myself? You think you think I have to be like you because everybody else's father is this father that. Well, I'll be watching people follow the same thing forever and it's never worked. So you want me to continue the process?
00:21:52
So you think I'm going to be an idiot like that famous thing that you would like to say? You know what insanity is like if you keep doing the same thing over expecting different results? Yeah, it's insanity.
00:22:01
So you want me to be insane with the rest of you and look stupid like the rest of you? I will not. And plus, I'm not fake. I'm always going to stick to the truth regardless of what I'm going to get attacked for. I don't care. It's the truth. So I'm will be vindicated anyway. Maybe not that moment. We're going to deal with the pressure, but overall, in time, people like us are going to be considered real heroes.
00:22:24
But we keep pushing our heroes away from us. And it's about who we don't go.
00:22:29
Nobody representing us. We've got nobody doing this.
00:22:31
I'm like, even when I'm in the hood and people talking, I'm like, Bro, you got somebody that is respected by the White House, bro. Like, we never had no way they look like me in the White House represented. I got tattoos all over my face, my hands. I'm in the White House. And you would think people would judge me and it's like. They didn't they love me and respect me for my mind and when I'm able to do but if you have somebody in that position that could actually make a phone call to somebody that's in a position to help our community, why are you attacking me?
00:23:04
Because all the people that you guys are supporting, they have no connection to anything. They may be famous. They may it is. But when it comes to actual power, they don't have any like I'm the conduit for you guys. I'm the ear that for them to be like you look, this was going on our neighborhood. This is what we need. But they'll attack me for thinking that I'm not helping my people. I'm like, like, oh, you got a whole bunch of white fans.
00:23:24
I'm like, well, my wife, man, you know what they tell me, my dear? They don't go. Thank you for what you're doing for us. I love what you're doing for your community.
00:23:35
Then I say I love what you do for us as Americans. I mean, a lot of them do, but they they always add, I love what you're doing for your community, but they look at it as, oh, you just doing what they want. You do you want to be white? I'm like, isn't that crazy, though?
00:23:48
I mean, because some of the stuff that people say in our community and I'm I am convinced that we are the most racist, but somehow we've sanctioned being racist towards white people. So nobody recognizes racism. Right. So case in point, when I post posted a photo of my husband and someone wrote, I mean, the racist comments are there for black who this must be, why she's conservative.
00:24:10
Oh, the white man.
00:24:11
This I said, just imagine that reversed. Imagine a white guy is married to a black woman and he posts a photo of his black wife and a bunch of white people comment under there. Oh, look, you know, that's why you're betraying our race. It's unfathomable. Could you imagine if a bunch of white people comment under that after seeing a black man wearing a white man, people would go crazy. They would say this is an example of racism, but black people do it comfortably, comfortably.
00:24:36
You know, talking about and I'm sitting here when you even say that you should be ashamed of yourself for not knowing your history, your ancestors died for that. Right.
00:24:42
OK, like when Love versus Virginia, the Supreme Court case when they literally got imprisoned, a black and a white person for falling in love, you know what I mean? These people fought to end that sort of discrimination so that you can marry who you love. Right? True equality, being able to marry who you love, where their background does it matter. And you're ashamed of that. You what your you say you want integration, but you're fighting for more segregation.
00:25:06
You want people to hate. I don't hate white people. I don't feel that way.
00:25:09
And I don't feel like I have to hate white people to love my people. Yes, it is not. Neither were you. I love all people if they're good and I hate all people if they're stupid and stupid comes in every different color, you know what I mean?
00:25:20
Every different color, every ethnicity I've seen. I've seen stupid all across the board. And I just I hate that that pressure that is applied, that this is what it means to be black.
00:25:29
And I'm thinking to myself, what is the definition of that? I actually did a post about I said, what is it that defines me being black? Is it because I'm doing something positive? Because if you look at it, we're only doing positive things for our community. So in order for us to be accepted as black, we have to be doing negative. You have to be killing people. You have to be popping drugs. You have to be on some dumb stuff.
00:25:53
Like that's that's not what we represent. We don't come from that. Talk to me about the ones that didn't care about none of that. Like like that. Jack Johnson, who was the first black celebrity boxer at that time, like you said, they will go to jail. He married a white woman. He did.
00:26:09
He did. And he went he went to prison for. And actually, it's funny because the president is one that, you know, really told me the story and why he wanted to pardon him. And it to me, I think it's that part of the gap that we're facing is that there's this educational gap where they actually you have a bunch of people who know nothing about black history. They only know black PR. They only know black media and what what people are telling them and what it means to be black.
00:26:30
And then you have that culture being accused by celebrities who are largely ignorant. You know, LeBron James is No. One to me. I mean, he's so talented on the court, but this is not an educated man. Right? And so he takes the bait and a bunch of people follow him and they go, oh, yes, he LeBron is actually black. LeBron, you are hurting black America when you lie, when you don't research the fact, when you send a tweet and say we're literally being hunted absent any facts, you're not a hero in that regard.
00:26:57
You're not being a hero. You're being an idiot. And you're spreading that idiocy very quickly throughout our community. Your influences use your influence is huge.
00:27:05
You have a responsibility to either shut up or read research and know your facts. Right. And if you're not going to, we just know your facts and we just need you to play basketball because you're brilliant at that. Right. And you should be celebrated on the court. You're an amazing talent. But when you have our people outside from behind your Bel Air, multimillion dollar mansion. Right. Having them run outside. Moving now quickly to this deep on the police is not going to hurt him.
00:27:27
He's got private guards before. This man has a white chef, a white guy, a white chef, white gardener. He's got white people waiting on him hand and foot. Let me tell you, if that is racism, I want it today. Please let me get more than whatever LeBron James is.
00:27:40
Racism is. I want that racism. Right. Right.
00:27:43
And, you know, it really is. It's a broken culture. It's a broken society. And hip hop is hurting things. But I also want to talk to you about something.
00:27:51
I realize even if black Americans are aware and know their history right, and you can get black conservatives who understand the history much more, who understand, you know, the ills of the left and what the left has done. But still in that regard, they bring to the conservative side the same bad habits that I was hoping black conservatives would be abandoning.
00:28:10
And what I'm talking about, number one, is conflict resolution. Black Americans do not know how to resolve basic conflicts. Everything has to turn into a fight. I hate you forever. You have to draw lines. It's like you're this gang or that gang and you still see it happening in politics.
00:28:28
They hate him. Mentality's is big everywhere, I guess, because we come from the hater culture. Like you said, conflict resolution. Right. Me personally, I had a guy that shot at me five times in broad daylight at my old school in Queens, and that same guy, he ended up getting arrested, did five years, that same guy I see five years later in Jamaica and Queens. And I guess he's like he got he's basically like I was if he saw a ghost.
00:29:00
So I guess he thought I was over. I said, brother, look, you did five years wrote. Like, if you're not over it at this time, then I wouldn't know what to say. I'm overborrow. I don't you didn't kill me. You didn't kill nobody. I know at the end of the day, we're both alive. The best thing we could do is just is just leave it alone. Do you know that same person used to come to my studio that I built him up?
00:29:24
Am I am I in my community for people to come in and, you know, we have free studio time. I taught them engineering how to be able to record themselves so they wouldn't need anybody. And he's like my brother now, like literally it's like my brother. Like, if I call him and I say I have some drama, he's going to come and handle anybody. But even though I never try to entertain. But the whole point is we can solve issues.
00:29:49
The Mafia, they could the guy could have killed his brother two weeks ago, but because of the bigger picture, they will come together and a table would actually have a conversation to make sure nobody else does. And I think a lot of times we get so caught up with our emotions that we don't look at the bigger picture. Right at the end of the day, if I go and hurt him, there's somebody that loves him, too, that's going to hurt somebody in the cycle is just going to keep going and going.
00:30:14
Who who's going to end that cycle? We have to have one person in their mind and say, you know what? I am going to continue to cycle. And that's what I was about like, I'm not continuing this cycle because I know where it's going to go. So am I going to let my ego and my pride take that over and add more people lives from being destroyed knowing I'll do that? So, like I said, the example is I had somebody try to kill me and I was able to be cool with them.
00:30:41
You guys are ready to kill somebody because they don't even because you don't like what they said. That was about stuff that has nothing to do with you. You know, we all who you support. I hate to kill you. I get death threats like you wouldn't even believe. And I'm like, for me having my own opinion because they don't understand how, like you say, conflict resolution.
00:31:00
They don't know how to have a real conversation to actually have an understanding of what's going on in your mind of why you choose certain things.
00:31:08
And I touch that. I attach that to intellect, to I think, you know, as the education system continues to fail black America because it is failing black America, you know, when you can look in California and seventy five percent of boys can't read and you can go into Baltimore by 75 percent, black boys can't pass a basic literacy exam. We can go into Baltimore and across five schools can't find one kid child that's literate, proficient in math and writing.
00:31:29
You have an issue. We have a larger issue. And the issue, as I understand it from some recent books that I read, is that they've dumbed down the education system because they think anything that's considered a challenge now is not fair to black America. Right. So you actually have schools that are teaching Ebonics because they're saying that the schools have to be more cultural and adapt. It's the same thing with like before English should be a requirement. Now they're insisting on allowing kids to never have to learn a word of English and, you know, just speak Spanish throughout all of school, making sure those programs are available.
00:31:56
So we're seeing the sort of crowding of the education system. And when you if you can't, you know, think right. You're not going to be able to think through a situation or a conflict. Right. And say, OK, what are the benefits here? This person I'm upset about this. How what are the three different ways I can handle this? You know, my thing is always pick up the phone and call someone. Don't let it get to that.
00:32:17
B, pick up the phone, call somebody, say what you think and and let that be it and let it be the end of it. But you see today and I see this and I've been shocked to see it, even amongst black conservatives, public videos about each other.
00:32:29
I mean, there's so few of us, you know, that have a platform that can speak out and can be an example. Right. To to black children that don't know what to make of this world, that we're hoping that will understand that conservatism is a better brand.
00:32:43
You're calling yourself a conservative, but it is how you're acting conservatively. Is that really the example you want to be this call-out culture and you likened it off camera to the rap game, like rap, battle, culture, what are we doing? What are we teaching people? You know, how can we come together?
00:32:58
Is it said, you know, we just got to focus more on educating the youth right now? A lot of these people already lost. So there's really nothing you could do for somebody like that that has a certain mentality because they already feel how they feel. You have to educate them from young, even when my program is more about the program and certain things that they've been taught. And the only way you could do that is by getting them from you.
00:33:19
We've got to get them from you where we don't teach them that, oh, you can't do something because your skin color like and we push that shit in our community is like we affirm it. So it's like, well, I've heard this from women. I look well, people are telling me this every day. We're pushing that narrative, weakening our own community. And I don't think they understand when you say these things, you're hurting us. You're not helping thinking you're putting us on like you ain't put me on a shit bra like you only telling me how weak I am, how I can't do this.
00:33:48
I can't do that. Like you said, with the school system, all that proves how racist they are to believe that we're not even able to read or we're not able to. Do you speak English properly? Like, you know, I have like I think probably I would say because I wasn't big on school, because I, you know, that certain lifestyle I was living in school was not a priority. And I think maybe that kind of saved me from being indoctrinated in many ways because I'm just looking at how, you know, the way that our kids is now is like, you know, like how could we be dumber in a time when we should be smarter, you know?
00:34:21
But they but they just keep insulting us, say, oh, they need help.
00:34:25
Poor black people. I'm like, no more nothing. We're not poor black people.
00:34:30
I don't want to be looked at that way like, oh, cause I'm black. I'm not I can't do this. Like, that's insulting to me. Like, I don't know how anybody else is and take that as an insult. But for me that's insulting. Like we overcame every serious issue in our platform with black people. So how do we get to this point? First, I believe we can't do something like even when I voted for Obama the first time, I was like, oh, are you ordering?
00:34:58
I voted for him because he was black, but not the same reason why you voted for him, because he was black. I was just tired of hearing black people excuses because every time I see something, I do it whatever you want to it. I know we can't we can't be president like, ha ha ha ha.
00:35:13
We got one.
00:35:14
Now, what is your excuse now? Because there's nothing we cannot do this. Oh, we don't have our own airport business, I said. Wrong again, and these are the things or we don't have our own banks wrong again. Stop thinking that we can't do things, but we don't show that so no more. You don't see the why you think these kids want to be drug dealers because that's the only people in the hood that they see a successful you know, because once people become doctors, these are all the people that was being called names like we were saying earlier, actually.
00:35:44
So you don't see acting white, so you don't see them people in the community. So they don't know that is other options to be successful in driving these cars and have a nice house. They don't see these options. Only options they get is the pimp, the drug dealer and the scammers and the and the and the Jack boys. So it's like these are the only options and they're all negative options, even though I fell into that trap myself. But at the same time, these are negative options.
00:36:11
There's other ways. But if you keep pushing the people that are able to let them see that away from the community, you're only leaving them with them for options. So what do you think is going to happen? Because people are going to go back? Because in our community, watching a lot of times we have to give tangible things. They've been told us their whole life that they actually have to see something now in order for them to fully believe it.
00:36:31
Like, all right, let me see which one it hear. You said you was going to do this. Well, let me see it. That's when they'll start kind of like waking up because they were like, oh it could really happen. That's why with me I use myself an example because I come from that and I'm like, look, bro, look at me.
00:36:46
Like, look at me, bro, how can you not do it? And I come from the same exact circumstances as you, how did I do it? Oh, you got paid. Oh, he did make no, bro. I changed my mindset. I focused on what I wanted to do. And I did it right.
00:37:02
Right. And until we developed that and I think it's self-confidence. Right. And that a lot of this really stems from insecurity and talking about when this happened, you know, Shelby Steele is a pretty good job of talking about really in the mid 60s. The problem, the thing that happened in black America that changed everything and this is such an interesting thesis is freedom. So he says that, you know, when black Americans were actually fighting for their freedom because there was a real struggle in place, they were doing everything that they could.
00:37:30
So they were, you know, being upstanding citizens and families were together. And it was just a whole different there was an actual community because there was a real struggle to fight for. And at the very moment that they got freedom, things changed. And he says and this is an interesting philosophy, that freedom after years of actual oppression is a very hard concept to grapple with because you're whole time you're fighting for people to realize that you're not unequal.
00:37:51
Right. You're like, I can be equal. I'm the same as you. Please, please, please. And finally, society says, yup, done. You get your freedom. And then he says people actually go through a period of, like, shock because you're so used to like being in this cave, because now they have to grapple with the fact that they actually aren't equal because they shouldn't be, because they have been systematically oppressed. But now you're up you're mixed up with white people.
00:38:13
White people are more well read than you. You know, they're doing better at math and all the stuff. And the only way that you can catch up is through hard work. Right. But people aren't don't want to do that work. Right. It's the easier you feel more comfortable saying, oh, well, the reason we're not there is because it's a systemic question. So you get into this, you know, the self-defeating cycle, because the only way you're going to catch up is if you do the work, but you're not going to do the work because, you know, you want to hide behind the boogeyman of racist racism now.
00:38:36
And we've been behind the boogeyman for a very long time. Right. We're not challenging. Our kids do the work. We're not making our kids study harder. We're not our kids are not excelling at school. The gap has not disappeared at all between white and black Americans academically. Our kids are not graduating high school, high school at a good rate.
00:38:52
You know, we're twenty times walking of prison where our families are broken down, that all of these problems and we refuse to address any of them, which is why I just find the Black Lives Matter movement to just be rooted in fraud and and it just a lack of courage, complete cowardice.
00:39:07
I would support that movement in a second if they were talking about what we're talking about, if they were talking about black on black crime, if they were talking about abortion, if they were talking about father absence, I'd be like, this is yes, finally we are having a real discussion with ourselves, but we won't do it.
00:39:22
Yeah, because, you know, they only focus on a specific type of problem that is the least of our problems. So I always I always say this like, so are we going to focus more on the leaky faucet or the fire in our kitchen? Yeah. Like, what do you think is more point? OK, it could be a problem eventually. You know, if we keep letting it happen, maybe it'll become a problem with the leaky faucet.
00:39:45
Bill might go up a little bit. The noise might be a little annoying, but if you ignore that fire, you destroy the whole house. So we we have to stop letting them push those narratives because you're not focusing on the root of the problem. And to me, it's like a weed, right? Even if you cut the top, the weed will go right back. You would have to uproot it from the root in order to stop it from growing.
00:40:07
And this is why I tell people I look at the end of the day, we have to focus on the real situation, because if we take care of the real situation, the police brutality situation would disappear. If you have upstanding citizens.
00:40:19
Exactly. They don't want to get into these confrontations with black people, you know what I mean? Yes.
00:40:23
It was like it's like what does our problems, fatherhood, lack of education, health, fact, lack of respect like. So why don't we focus on those things that's really destroying our community?
00:40:36
Because I heard the teargas. There's no black on black crime. I said, so what do you call black people killing black people? They will say, well, white people kill white people to buy black regardless.
00:40:46
First of all, we're not talking about white people, so don't add them into the mix because they're not the ones out here screaming and crying and bitching out like you guys are the only ones doing this. So we have to talk about your issues because you're forcing us to talk about it. So we got to speak on black on black crime because we're killing each other at an alarming rate. We're more than white people are killing each other. So how are you telling me there's no black on black crime yet?
00:41:09
Is white on white crime? Is black on black crime is Asian or Asian crime.
00:41:13
We understand we kill amongst our demographics, but we're doing such a high level that you have to talk about that first.
00:41:20
Like I said, that's the fire in the kitchen. So we have to speak on that because no one, you guys are crying all day about it, and that's a bigger issue. So if you just ignore that issue.
00:41:32
Ninety five percent of black people are killed by other black people. Just ignore. Ninety five percent ignore that.
00:41:37
And that was my problem with Black Lives Matter. It's like why you guys are not focusing on the things that's really going to prevent that. It's because they. Wanted to continue to happen their race baiters, this how to get money like Al Sharpton, they're not going to get nothing from an alive black person. They need a dead one. They got killed by a specific circumstance in order for them to receive the money, so they have to put that fear.
00:42:01
They have to put their hate where police they have to talk about that all the time so they could get new business every year or every election time. So they're not trying to save anything at all. What are you trying to say? Why? I don't have they got billions of dollars of budget? Why I don't go and go to neighborhoods and give 20 million per these bad neighborhoods to build schools or centers have make sure they have better education, make sure they have you.
00:42:25
If you guys want to provide security, why didn't I march in from when a young black man gets killed by a stray bullet that had nothing to do with something? Why didn't not marching up that hood every day, rioting, not riding, but walking up and down every day? You think they're going to shoot anybody when that's happening because they can't raise millions?
00:42:42
You could potentially save hundreds of lives just doing that, because I think and I think even with anybody that's doing some power, you save one life. You could potentially save the world. You guys are not even looking to save lives.
00:42:53
You just want to deal with dead black men and they raise tons of money. And that's also one of the most frustrating elements is the idea of Candice's must be getting paid so well to say what she says.
00:43:04
No, no, no, no, no. Guys, look at your community. How much do you think they're getting paid to say what they say? This is what you don't understand. They're the ones pocketing millions of dollars, right?
00:43:12
When George Floyd died within 48 hours, Black Lives Matter raised forty million dollars within 48 hours. Nobody knows where the money is. We got 15 million.
00:43:20
We got 15 separate from the 40 million that was raised. Right. Nobody. How much money do I get? The truth? Zero. I got Hater's death threats.
00:43:29
This is how I'm making money. Who do you think is who? We think it's cutting edge. I think what like we always get that right. Who do you think is cutting me a check to tell you the truth about who George Floyd was? Who do you think is. Thank you, Candice. Let me write you.
00:43:39
If I want to make money, I jump on the Black Lives Matter side. That's the that is where they're making the highest profit margins. You can have five dead black person, a white person that's responsible and make millions and never get question on where the money goes.
00:43:52
You disappear, right? Spend your millions, wait for years and earn the exact same millions again for the exact same scenario. And they don't get that.
00:44:00
You're accusing the people that are telling me the truth of earning money for telling you the truth and celebrating people that are telling you lies that are pocketing millions and stealing it from you. That is my problem with Black Lives Matter and the perception in the media.
00:44:11
And the reality is we should be getting paid millions of dollars. Right, for telling the truth. Right.
00:44:16
I wish I could get millions of dollars. Why not?
00:44:19
Because we're the real Black Lives Matter movement, you know, that's why, you know, I didn't because after I did the hashtag, I didn't know. Nobody else said it. But I was I pushed the whole or Black Lives Matter.
00:44:31
Oh, that was you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:44:33
So and people was like, oh, you know, like I said, yes, we're going to protect all black lives. Don't just make it a specific type of black situations. Let's make it all you want. The police brutality. We got that in there too. But let's talk about preventing fatherless homes. Let's prevent these young black women from having abortions, which I believe is a choice thing. But I feel like just having the access makes it more easier for them to even go, OK, just get rid of my baby.
00:45:02
We got to stop that. We got to stop all every situation. If a little baby gets shot by a stray bullet, we supposed to be there for that, too. If we need education, we supposed to be there for that, too. It can't just be coming around for that one specific situation. And it's like they get mad when you say that. Like, first of all, even when I say all lives matter, where does that exclude black people at the word all is in the equation?
00:45:27
Why are you guys mad about that? And if be like, oh, you're taking away from our movement, you don't have a movement, any movement to take away from all the message. I'm like, but this message is B.S. It's not real, but they keep pushing it. And you really believe this is real.
00:45:42
You really believe if you walk outside, you'll just get shot? Michot People really believe that. That's sad to me. Like if you live in that kind of lifestyle, were you that afraid you got to change the way you're living right now? That's horrible. Right.
00:45:54
And if you really I mean, just even pretending that we live in a racist society, I'm like, where do you go that you just see black and white people added it all the time or spent any any race where where do you live that that is your natural occurrence, that you act like you live in the 1940s, you you've literally accepted a media simulation.
00:46:09
It's just not real racism. My life ever.
00:46:12
I mean, it I mean, it's just of course, there's going to be pocket of race, you know, racists somewhere that are hiding out. Right. But you're calling people racist or even racist. You can even look at a situation for what it is. You know what's ironic?
00:46:23
I actually you know, I also did a video about the two Kerans in the park, as I called it. You know what I mean? Like, oh, you need your dog on a leash and you start, you know, harassing her that she didn't kill anyone and everyone. This woman's life real quick. Right. Fired from her job, dog taken away all that stuff.
00:46:37
And I said I said to my dad, imagine if they were the exact same scenario, if it was a black woman walking her dog in the park on a leash and a white dude came up to her and started filming and said, your dog needs to be on a leash, needs this black America could have been on fire.
00:46:51
They wouldn't be like she can't even walk her dog without white people coming in. You know what's more peaceful, she's walking her puppy, we just we don't see it's always about the race. And if you even if you flip the races and you get the exact same scenario, again, opposite response, you're black America.
00:47:05
And to me, that's sad. It is sad that we are put we have a lot of I don't know, I can't call it Karen. Right. And I think some black women have the name Karen, but we have people that act like Karen in our community or worse, white like way worse than I ever seen. But, you know, the only paint that one picture, because they want to push that narrative, they want us to think that people don't like us.
00:47:28
I've never encountered racism. And the funniest thing is like I've been a hood. I'm like and even like your man, wake people racism, white boy. You ain't never hung out with white people your whole life. You've been stuck in these four corners your whole life. You never even had an encounter with white people. You never even hung around white people. How do you know? Because somebody told you.
00:47:47
Like, I've made that mistake in my life, too, before, and I learned my lesson, I said, look, check this out. I've heard negative things about certain people and I was trying to mess with them because of what I heard instead of what I knew.
00:47:58
Lost out on great opportunities because of that. So it's was like, why would I continue to make the same stupid moves? Because I'll meet that same person that they talk about.
00:48:08
And I'm like, well, I didn't see none of that you were talking about. Like, this is this is this is not true. And to me, like, this is something that we have to change. And if we don't change it, instead of just believing what people hear, we at that point now when we hear something, we just believe that's what it is about whatever situation or what about whatever person. And I'm like, you're going to ruin so many opportunities in your life with that mentality.
00:48:34
You guys never been around?
00:48:35
No white people going with somebody, people if you feel the same way right now, we have to start combating the media perception with actual experiences. And I want to ask you this as a last question. Are you optimistic or pessimistic about the direction that black America is trending toward?
00:48:54
I'm kind of in between in many ways because I think especially from this conservative movement, I'm seeing a lot of young black people that are like, given us hope, like, oh, man, we can make it happen. But then again, you have the overpowering of the negative. So it seems like that's all they want to push to show. So we got to combat that. So when we get to where we start lessening the negatives and so showing more of the positives, then I'd be more awesome optimistic right.
00:49:28
Type of move. But right now I'm kind of stuck in between because it's like it's at a point where you don't know where it's going to go. So, like, for me, I'm always an optimistic person, so I'm always going to go with I'm optimistic we change because we've been through the worst and we always overcame. But it's like like I said, like you said before, I like yo, you know, you're doing something positive and they push you is like to like not even mess with them anymore because they attack you for it.
00:49:53
But like I said, I'm optimistic. So I'm a go I'm a weight go towards the optimistic side and say, listen, I think we're going to have a major change soon, especially with people like us continue to do what we're doing. Eventually, people are going to wake up because I seen it. I got hundreds of thousands of people that hit me up like, yo, you changed my life, bro. Like I used to think this type of way and now listening to you.
00:50:13
So I know people want to listen because that day, as we continue to tell the truth, whether we get backlash for it or not, eventually the truth is going to prevail. You cannot beat the truth. It doesn't matter how long the battle is with the lie, the truth is always going to win.
00:50:27
Oh, I love that. That's so powerful. I love that. All right. Well, we wrap every episode with allowing you to leave a faith message for the world. So if you could in two minutes say something that you hope would fall on the ears of every single person, not just in our community and the larger American community and throughout the world. And you think that it could impact change?
00:50:47
What would it be? You're going to. I don't even need two minutes. You don't even need to mature right now is one word. All right. Well, hold on.
00:50:54

If we learn to work together as a people, there's nothing that's going to stop us at the end of the day, even when you want to talk about white people. But in our past, if it wasn't for white people, we would not be free because we had to have a large amount of white people saying, I don't want to see black people being treated like animals in order for us to, because if we live in the world, when we go by the percentage 70 percent white people and you got 40 percent black people, if they did vote and 70 percent was all white, we're done.

We will still be in slavery. You us working together is what the threat is. And that's why they try to separate us with this whole race thing. We have to be united. This is the United States of America. We have to be united as a people because we're not just white, black and any other culture. We're human beings. And the only way we could change things is being united is unity. And unity is the key. Without unity, nothing can happen because if we keep bridging and adding more gaps into our entire lives is going to cause more conflict and it's actually going to actually create more racism.
00:52:09
So let's just continue being unity. Stop worrying about who people are married to is irrelevant. Stop worrying about the stuff that don't matter. We always focus on the things that don't matter instead of focusing on what does matter, and that's unity and working together, the only way we're going to have change. Amen.
