00:00:10
OK, ladies and gentlemen, we are rolling into another episode of The Kandace Owens Show.
00:00:19
You get up really early, right? Not that. I mean, I get up at four thirty in the morning, not that early.
00:00:24
I hear that you just said not that early. Four thirty in the morning. Completely crazy. Completely crazy. All right.
00:00:30
For three in the morning is early by everybody standard who has not been in the military. I'll tell you that. Right. So four, three in the morning, an incredible time to get to get up to early time to get up. And tell you what's interesting about that, I read an article about the habits. They basically interviewed the most successful people in the world, a bunch of billionaires, maybe like 10 billionaires, and tried it from just the way they lived their lives, figure out what things that they all had in common.
00:00:51
And the number one thing was waking up early. All of them got up at like four thirty in the morning. Yeah.
00:00:56
And, you know, I get pushback on that all the time. People tell me it's unhealthy people and there's books about how unhealthy it is. And and, you know, another thing is and I put this all the time, there is a single mom.
00:01:08
There are single moms all over the place, single dads that are out there that are getting up at three o'clock in the morning so they can do their first shift at work in a diner somewhere as a waitress. When they get done with that, they're coming home, taking their kids to school. Then they're going off to their second job, doing whatever. And at night they're doing their third job. So I have the luxury I have the luxury of getting up early in the morning and I get up early in morning and I work out and have time for myself.
00:01:28
That's a luxury for me. There's plenty of people that wake up earlier than that because they have to. And hopefully people that have that attitude over time, they'll be able to work themselves out of that position where they can actually get up because they want to.
00:01:40
As a comedian, the show is hilarious, not just yours. Politics of America. Wow, you guys are dramatic.
00:01:46
It's the longest running. I don't know if it's a sitcom or if it's some. It's very days of our lives in a real hospital.
00:01:55
Almost a little Spanish soap opera is very soap opera. Why is she yelling for no reason? Yeah, you know what I mean. Like, I know I always say that.
00:02:03
I'm like, what is the perception outside of the walls of America and what's going on here?
00:02:07
Because like you saw on the TV and it is just so theatrical. I mean, you can't compete with our real life here, but there's no point in making soap operas. There's no point in making Broadways because like, we are living it every single day here.
00:02:19
Yeah. America the musical. Yeah, right. And then the award shows and like like the other day with Michelle Williams we were talking about, I had an abortion, but now I have this piece of plastic.
00:02:30
I was like, I wish I was wearing what planet we were on. So for people that are watching us. You didn't watch the Golden Globes? I definitely didn't either. I just then went to go find clips because Ricky Gervais was just so amazing in roasting the room. But there is Michelle Williams, who is an actress who accepted an award for something. And she goes up and she Godlee acting.
00:02:50
She gets a little statue for something, she gets a little statue, and she gives this speech, which was pro-abortion. And she basically said, I would have never earned this inanimate object if I did not kill my baby and get an abortion years ago. And the room broke out into applause for this speech.
00:03:09
Cheers. And the women here are crying. And I'm just like all the crazy, you crazy people you like the same people that are like Timbaland did cocaine in the 80s who didn't, from what I know, and they hate him because of that or like kill the babies. Yeah, it was just weird. I was really just like, this is this is the Twilight Zone. Like, this is this is why people think Hollywood is just like an infestation at this point, because I was like, what a bizarre thing.
00:03:34
Like you murdered your child for an inanimate object. I'm supposed to be celebrating that and saying, how about saying, you know, what if you got even if you got an abortion, you can still be pro-life. And that is a stance that I take because it's less black and white. It's less you kill the baby, you're a murderer. That doesn't work. That's the same kind of stuff the left does on the other side. If I believe in my position and I do that, then it's a life.
00:03:55
How about saying to them, I know that you can it can be very confusing when you're young and you're told that your whole life's going to get ruined if you get pregnant. It's just a clump of cells and you could make a decision, but you can change your mind.
00:04:06
There's so much there. So so first off, partly why the left is always screaming is they don't know really what their starting point is. So so people on the right, generally, if you're if you're an American, you believe in individual rights. You believe that every single person, regardless of their skin color or sexuality or gender, blah, blah, blah, should have the same exact rights on the left. You sort of have this idea that the state is kind of supposed to do a lot of stuff and then the disagreement is how much it should do.
00:04:34
So the best way I can explain this is if you think back to the 2016 election, it was like if you picture, you know, Marco and Cruz and Trump all up there, they didn't have massive substantive issues. They had issues about personality. Right. So Trump is your little Marco and you're lying, Ted, and you're this one and blah, blah, blah. But they didn't. But they sort of all believe in the Constitution. They all believe that America is fundamentally good.
00:04:56
And the rest of it, if you look at where the Democrats have been for the last couple of years, it's like they kind of don't really believe in the Constitution all the time. They kind of tell you that they never say words like freedom and liberty. Imagine if someone walked. On stage at one of those things and said the word freedom, people will be like, you're at the wrong event, buddy. What are you talking about here?
00:05:15
But I think that gets to why they're so hysterical all the time, because they have this idea that the state is supposed to do a lot and then the next guy is like, no, the state should do more. And then you're kind of like, oh, maybe it should. Otherwise I'm a bad guy. So it's like when they say they're for fifteen dollar minimum wage and then Rasheeda Talib comes along, that's, you know, Bernie's been pushing fifteen forever, which is a horrible idea on so many levels and and antithetical to American ideas, because why should the government be able to force a private company what to do and put that aside.
00:05:42
But then Rasheeda comes along, she's like, no, it should be 20. And it's like, well, she's kind of right because you just made up a number. So why not make another number and then somebody is going to come along and go over your racist. It's twenty five years. So it's like so they don't know what their fundamental principle is. And because of that. Because of that. That's why they're crazy all the time. Because constantly you're looking around going, who's going to outdo me on something.
00:06:05
And I think that's a fundamental piece of why having a debate about abortion, which I've tried to do a million times, Lila Rose, who you've had her on on this show. Right. So she's been on my show. I think she's wonderful. Obviously, we have some disagreements on this stuff. I have put out there many times on Twitter. I would love to have a pro-choice advocate come on the show with Lila Rose. We've invited Alyssa Milano and the collection of of usual suspects.
00:06:30
Totally, respectfully. We've reached out publicly and privately. Nobody, nobody. And there's a reason for it. It's not just that, Dave.
00:06:37
They've is me or something like that or that Lilo's Olaya or something like that is not true statements. Obviously, it's that they don't want to actually debate these things in a calm way because they need the emotion to override the argument because. The second the voters figure out they can vote themselves money. It's all over and that's essentially I'm going to offer you free health care and free college tuition. And it's like, well, I'm going to give free college tuition, health care, and I'll eliminate any debt.
00:07:12
Oh, OK. Maybe that guy now and it's like that the experiment is over and the politicians have figured out that it's like you got two kids in the house and I'm running on a platform of scrambled eggs and oatmeal in the morning and my wife's running on a platform of Reese's peanut butter cups. And nobody needs to go to school on Mondays. And they go, Oh, we're voting for mom right now.
00:07:46
And then I'm going, but that's unhealthy. And in the big picture, it's not going to be good. You know, your dental hygiene is not going to be good. There's early onset diabetes. You're not going to be properly educated when you enter the workforce. And like, yeah, OK, we'll be enjoying our peanut butter cups over here. That's such a perfect analogy.
00:08:04
And that's that's what it is. And the politicians have been like, well, let's just offer peanut butter cups.
00:08:10
And that literally reminds me of an elementary school we had we had to like a president for our class or our grade.
00:08:18
And there were two people running each other and one of them just ran, you elect me. It was like a mock election free. We're going have free lunch and blah, blah, free this and free that. And they went and they got really glittery nice posters and that person won like no one cared.
00:08:29
I mean, about the economics of it, he said, is going to be like, we didn't actually get it. It was like a mock election. But the kid that won was the one that offered the most free stuff.
00:08:36
So really, fundamentally, what you have on the left is people that have adopted an elementary, elementary, fifth grade, you know, election style, you know, how am I going to get elected in a group full of people that don't they can't help themselves. I don't want to help themselves be. But love free stuff.
00:08:53
Yeah, it seems to be the majority. It's a steady diet of free stuff mixed in with your vict. And I'm going to fix that.
00:09:01
Right. And victims easy, by the way. And you always wonder why people love all these different categories of how to be a victim because victim with easy life stuff, right. Saying, hey, you know what, life life's really tough and it's tough for everybody. It's not it's not an easy thing to be a good human being, to be a productive human being every single day, day in and day out. So it's much easier to offset all of your problems and to say, you know what, it's not my fault if I fail here.
00:09:22
Forget getting back up. Right. Forget getting back. I'm trying. I'm going to say I failed because of this. That's an easy pass, right? To say I'm actually yeah, I know I haven't done anything my life, but it's because of the white person, the tall person, the rich person, the whatever person.
00:09:34
That's all me. Did you say ruggedly handsome. And I just.
00:09:39
Here, let me ask you a question. Let's say the world moves as quickly technologically as it has been. So in the next 100 years, you know, the world is is being largely driven by what's happening out in space. Is it fair to say that if we don't get in this, if it is a space does become dominated by China, if they dominate space and they will they dominate the world?
00:10:00
Oh, yeah, there's no question. There's no question. There's no being a world power, but we're not playing in space.
00:10:05
Right. And the subtlety here is that we get trapped in the paradigms of the past. So right now, when people think about space and the way we've done space since 1960 as we just fall around the earth, you know, and you think of a satellite command, and so it's just falling around the earth, bringing GPS and timing and weather satellites and and pictures from space so that you can see every part of planet Earth.
00:10:30
That's all fine and good, but that's a paradigm we're stuck in. What China is looking to is the economy of space outside of that gravity.
00:10:37
Well, outside of orbits where you're maneuvering between the earth and the moon and Mars and you have an infrastructure, it would be like us building the Eisenhower interstate system in order to allow towns to thrive in little economies all over. Imagine our country without railroads or roads. Those railroads and roads make us vibrant economically.
00:11:03
China is building those roads and railroads into space, and if we aren't there with them, they will benefit from the the the resources on the moon, on asteroids and the sun as they build out capability to receive that sun energy and modify it into safe radiowaves that can be absorbed into devices and power. Anything and cislunar space. The system, the space means between the earth and the moon and beyond.
00:11:31
So this is where they're going. And if we don't, they will be able to do things. They will be able to weaponize information and energy because of what they can do with a network in space. They will be able to dominate transportation because they will have the transportation capability to get this infrastructure in space. They can take anybody. On planet Earth, you could get into a spacecraft, Elon Musk is building this right now in Brownsville, Texas, get on a spacecraft and be in Singapore in thirty nine minutes, walk around, go shopping and be home for dinner.
00:12:05
So let me ask you a question. What is your perspective on some of the clean energy solutions?
00:12:10
Do you have any in mind?
00:12:12
Solar, let's go solar first and then we'll go wind and then we'll go hydro.
00:12:16
Well, so look, broadly speaking, what what we should be in favor of is energy. Like, we don't really care where it comes from. We want to have a few characteristics. We need it to be reliable. That's one really important thing. We need to have as much of it as we need on demand. And then we need it to be low cost on a large scale, because if it's not low cost on a large scale, then people can't have it.
00:12:38
And part of the context is in the world today, three billion people lack reliable, low cost energy. Just think about that like no. And a billion people lack electricity. Totally. So no refrigerator, no lights, no warming. I mean, the most they're getting is they're cooking their food and heating their homes with wood and animal dung. So we've got a world of eight billion people and three billion are what I call unempowered. Right. They don't have they can't use machine power to improve their lives.
00:13:05
And so when we're looking at source of energy, the question isn't just, OK, can this technically produce energy at some price? At some point in some place, it's can it produce reliable, low cost energy for billions of people to be scaled? Yeah. Can it be scaled and can it be reliable and can it be versatile? Can it do all the things like flying planes and, you know, running trains and agriculture and agriculture do runs on oil and it runs on natural gas.
00:13:32
So we have to first understand that fossil fuels have this amazing thing where they provide 24/7 energy for every need of billions of people. And so when you're looking at something like solar and wind, the question isn't like, oh, do I like the sun? It's has anyone figured out how to create a process by which we can turn sunlight into low cost, reliable energy? And the short answer for all of these is going to be no. So if you talk about.
00:13:55
So I'm all in favor of people trying, but I need to recognize the reality about whether they have. And if they haven't, they should be free to try. So I'm in favor of energy freedom. But unfortunately, the Green New Deal is it's basically outlawing fossil fuels and then mandating solar and wind.
00:14:11
You look at Martin Luther King just as one example where Martin Luther King leveraged the spectacle of violence to get America to pay attention. The only difference is Martin King said, we're going to strategize so that we could be right when I go to other people up. But we're getting beat, right? I mean, the Pettus Bridge was it was the idea of being a bridge was, you know, if we if we protest here that they that that these police will come and harm us and that American strategy because it showed America that the problem was the police.
00:14:36
Do you think the spectacle right now is showing America? The problem is the police.
00:14:38
The problem is know it's not when you look at these riots, it is not. This is the exact opposite of Martin Luther King's strategy, the exact opposite. Martin Luther King said, we're going to go in and be peaceful and we're going to watch them set dogs on us.
00:14:51
They're going to set their fire hose on us. And when the whole world sees these clips, they're going to realize that the problem is are white people that are racist and the and the governments that are allowing this terror to go on. OK, when he crushed that, it was a brilliant strategy. Right now, black America strategy is we're going to go in and be violent. We're going to go in and loot. We're going to go in and take the TVs.
00:15:13
And then America is going to think Black Lives Matter is a terrorist unit.
00:15:17
And that's exactly what the concept is. It is. It is.
00:15:20
I guess what I'm pushing back first when I'm pushing back, we don't look good. This is not making black people look good.
00:15:25
The first thing I push back against is this idea that the only time we can engage in the type of resistance is if we're if our bodies are the ransom for justice.
00:15:31
I'm just telling you that Martin Luther straight. No, no, I'm with you. I'm agreeing that it's not. I'm saying it's not exactly it's not the same tactic. The overall strategy is still to use violence and the spectacle to look back to get justice. Right. And you're like, what I'm hearing you say is, that's cool. If the dogs are biting us in the hoses, bring us. I'm saying you're not. The message you're going to deliver is that black people are violent.
00:15:49
So using the idea and you have just already said that you thought Martin Luther King had a good strategy. And I agree with you, what we are doing is exact opposite strategy. So we are showing that black people are violent, that black people loot, that black people, Robert, black people kill another. That is that that is what is being shown. How you think we're winning with that narrative? I don't know. I don't I don't know what is right now.
00:16:05
I was thinking I'm so glad we took those tweets at a target and burn down target because now people are seeing more part of what happened. The other thing is, what was the spectacle that was shown? No, no. I'll tell you when we when we talk about King. Right, because there's King in the marching in sixty five. But there's also what's happening in what's in sixty five. What's happening in Detroit in sixty seven. You know, there aren't the same rebellions you're talking about are having around.
00:16:29
And what happened here. My, my point is it's never a single strategy. Right. There's always multiple things happening.
00:16:37
Right. There are people calling for defunding right now and there are people on the streets just like King. There are people who there are people who are marching and getting beaten by police, and there are people who are tearing up Detroit. And what I'm saying, we need multiple strategies.
00:16:48
Now, I agree with you. I would love I would love if I. Had to say, I have a bookstore in Philadelphia and a whole bunch of stores on my block that got smashed, sneaker store got raided.
00:17:00
What else got? Another O'Haire store got raided.
00:17:03
My bookstore did not write. My coffee shop did not. Now why?
00:17:08
Well, it's not nearly as random as you might think. Much of a lot of this stuff is, oh, you turned down your own shit. Most of it now isn't ours. All right. Most of it are people who are occupying our neighborhoods. Most of them were taken, most of these homes that we don't own. So some target where they hire majority black people.
00:17:25
So you've taken black people's jobs in that situation. I mean, I just I'm trying to see one positive thing in burning down and looting and robbing. And I want to go back because you brought up the you know, the mid 60s protests and the and the riots, rather, because they weren't protesting the notorious Detroit and Chicago rebellion place. They were rebellions, riots, same thing which are forms of protest. OK, sure.
00:17:45
What was the consequence of that?
00:17:48
The Voting Rights Act of 60 of the this happened before that 64.
00:17:52
The riots happened in 67 and 68. The right. Yeah, no different.
00:17:56
OK, so King dies in 68 and we get more civil rights legislation months later. And this in the aftermath of rebellion.
00:18:03
But what what was the source? The thing is, people, you're looking for a piece of legislation. But what happened?
00:18:07
Detroit and Chicago were the the economic booms for the black community. The riots happened. The rich people got up and they left and they depressed those cities. OK, OK. So the thing is, is that this is the problem.
00:18:19
Everybody wants to be in the now. I'm in the later. OK, I'm already hearing the conversations amongst business owners. They're leaving. They're going to the cities. So you want to talk about signing up for another 60 years of black poverty, just like we did. We signed up for black poverty and it started in the nineteen sixties. First and foremost, it was the legislation that was supposed to be helpful. Nope. That led to economic depression, too, because incentivize bad behavior.
00:18:37
All of the the Great Society Act and all that stuff that happened in the mid 60s was not good for black America.
00:18:42
Sounded good like everything a Democrats before sounded great. We're going to give you stuff but really incentivize father absence it welfarist the black community and it made us married us to the government. On top of that, we burn in our own communities thinking that we were going to get justice. And what really happened is the business leaders left the jobs left. Black people had no jobs and we were poor. And we had we had now had sixty years complaining about the condition of Chicago and Detroit in these inner cities.
00:19:05
And we're recreating the wheel all over again right now.
00:19:08
I think that's a heck of an analysis. It's the truth. No, no, I think it's not. It is. That's what happened in the sixties.
00:19:16
But by and large, the police, we are blaming the messenger. The real problem is black crime. I hate to say it, but that is the real problem. All you're telling the truth and that makes you a racist, an avowed racist.
00:19:32
Why does it matter that since George Floyd, three dozen children have been killed, about 98 percent of them black? We've lost a one year old in New York. We've lost a one year old, a three year old and a seven year old in Chicago. We've lost a four year old in Kansas City, an eight year old in Birmingham.
00:19:54
When we say the cops have to back off and and we allow this type of ruthless, uncontrolled behavior, it is black kids who suffer kandace the racism of this country. You know, I'm so sick of the liberal press. If three dozen white children had been killed, there would be a revolution.
00:20:18
The press doesn't give a damn about black lives. It doesn't give a damn. It doesn't give a damn about black children. It only gives a damn if a black person is shot by a cop. Right? Right. And that is a fraction of all the blacks have been killed.
00:20:33
Last year, according to The Washington Post, there were nine unarmed blacks who were shot.
00:20:38
And by the way, you can be unarmed, still be very violent. You can be grabbing the officer's gun. You can be you can be beating him with his own equipment.
00:20:46
And the post is going to classify you as unarmed. Those nine represent point one percent of all blacks who were killed last year. There were probably that we're going to probably see about 70, 300 blacks point one percent.
00:21:02
The cops are not the problem. The problem is crime and and the media only cares if it's white kids that are being killed. Look, they all freak out at Newtown, Connecticut. Yes, terrible. There is a Newtown, Connecticut, periodically, cumulatively several times a year in the black community. And the press turns its eyes away because it is not willing to talk about black on black crime.
00:21:31
So the people that you're spending time with in prison, are they from all over? Are some of these people in prison for life?
00:21:36
I mean, so most of them have been in prison for a long time and are nearing release. No one that we work with is going to be remaining in prison for life unless they commit another crime. So there are kind of on their way out and we're trying to give them a better pathway forward. So we're helping them develop business plans, but we're also kind of just surrounding them. We provide transition home so they can go and stay there instead of going back directly into that community they came from.
00:21:57
Give them some time to readjust. We provide them links to jobs, try to help them out so that they can get work and kind of get on their feet. So I think you made a good point is that when they come out very often, you know, you can't run a department because you have you know, you're blocked from doing that sometimes. I mean, a lot of times they will not even let you run an Airbnb because of that.
00:22:16
Can't get a job. I mean, you try to work for Uber, you might not get like there's just really no ways for you to move forward very often. So what we try to do is give them a way to create their own opportunity, because entrepreneurship, in my opinion, is the best way to kind of get out of that, you know, the lower socioeconomic status that they're stuck in. And we see remarkable results because of this, because you cannot just take somebody and push them outside of prison and with 50 bucks and a bus ticket and tell them to go restart your life, you need to surround them.
00:22:46
And if you're going to take them out of society and remove them from everything they know, you know, I know a lot of people don't like to say that government needs to provide that kind of safety net in the end. But if we don't, we're not going to have any opportunity to actually reform these people. And luckily, the organization I work with is a nonprofit, so they don't deal with any government funding. But I think the larger issue is that our prisons need to figure out a way to soften the blow of letting these guys back into the real world because too much of an adjustment, then I feel like I'm blessed because Facebook and Twitter and all that stuff took off just at the end of me in high school.
00:23:18
And so I got to actually grow up and be a kid first, you know, so I got to grow up, be outside, be a kid, not be worried about what I look like, be gross, have braces and not worry. Do I look like this person that's on Instagram?
00:23:30
Not to mention, you know, you weren't in middle school regurgitating all of your vomiting, all of your thoughts onto the Internet to permanently live there forever.
00:23:38
I can only imagine if, you know, if the 12 year old me had my ideas out there permanently canceled. Right.
00:23:46
I'm canceled already all the time. So that would just make it worse. But yeah. And I do and I do empathize with the dilemma of parents. It's a little easier for me right now, I acknowledge, because my kids are younger, but. The when you when you let them get plugged into the Internet, it just makes it worse, because the problem is you send kids to public school. They're they're immersed in in this peer culture every single day for eight hours a day, five days a week, nine months a year for 12, 13 years.
00:24:17
And then they come home. And it used to be they came home and now they're home. And now at least you could try to recenter them again and get them focused on things that matter. But now they come home and they're still in that peer environment, that peer culture. They can never escape it because they carry it around in their pocket all the time. And so that becomes the only thing they care about. And so when you see the suicide rate among kids, which is just it's unheard of to have all these suicide kids killing themselves is is crazy.
00:24:44
I mean, it's unheard of. It's this didn't used to happen. It really didn't. Why is that? It's not that sometimes conservatives will say, oh, kids these days are a bunch of pansies. That's not it at all. OK, every kid is emotionally vulnerable and we all were. The difference is that what they care about because they're in this culture all the time, they get their identity from the their affirmation from their peers, and they can never escape it.
00:25:10
So if they don't get that affirmation, then they feel like there's no there's no point in living. This is my whole life.
00:25:17
And, you know, I'm not saying that taking the smartphone away will prevent all of that, but I think it could go a long way. And so you can do things that are metaphorical adherence to the script, but yet not change the script and just modernize its interpretation, it says, for example, you may marry more than one wife.
00:25:37
I've never I've never known a Muslim personally married to more than one wife.
00:25:41
So what do they do with that passage? You just say, hey, you know what? I ignore it. I'm not going to rip it out, but I'm going to say it just doesn't apply today and we don't apply it because he can't it shouldn't be applied.
00:25:50
But that's interesting to me because, I mean, if you're going to modernize it, if you're going to say we're not going to apply that and we don't believe in this or we're taking apart this or that, wouldn't you think that that would then result into just a conversion away from Muslim altogether because you don't agree with the core tenets of what, you know, the original script said and you did note that it's a minority. What you're doing is a minority movement.
00:26:10
Right? And so it is it is reformed like a reformed is the right word. Right. It's a total, total reformation.
00:26:15
Right. But I just don't see I don't know that you would if it's realistic to expect that the hundreds of millions of people that are holding the text that says, you know, anti Jewish rhetoric or is taking it literal and says take a bunch of lives, are they going to get behind this? Is that a realistic approach?
00:26:32
Well, I think if you had in 2010 said that there were going to be 20 million people in the streets of Cairo fighting their government, you would have said, no way, that's impossible. They're not going to fight against the military regime. Same in Syria or Iran or elsewhere. But they're doing they're waking up. So if you look at there's some recent studies that showed that it takes 10 percent of the population to have a significant movement to begin to change the other 90 percent.
00:26:59
So I think if you look in Tunisia, for example, it really took 10 percent of the population to begin to finally put the government on its heels and make the economy come to a standstill. The Tea Party movement, the conservative movement back in 2010, it really was 10 percent of the conservatives that went to the streets and then later became more that said we're going to take back. And now with the Trump movement against the establishment, how many activists did it take?
00:27:23
Most studies have shown it takes five to 10 percent is sort of the tipping point.
00:27:27
And I think with reform, if we start if you look at, yes, the cares of the World Council on American Islamic Relations, the Islamic State, North America, the Muslim Brotherhood, legacy groups on the Sunni side and the Khomeini's legacy groups on the Shia side, still to this day, they might be able to fill a hall with 50, 60 thousand people, but they still basically have 50 to 100 leaders that you might be able to see on TV from day to day if we get that same platform as the opportunity you're giving me here today with many of the people in our Muslim reform movement, which is part of what we're trying to do in this assembly, a future Muslim leaders of America.
00:28:03
Once we start getting this, I think you'll see that the silent majority will eventually wake up. My parents.
00:28:10
We didn't grow up in an expat community. We grew up in northern New Jersey, right outside of New York City. And my my parents actually made an effort for us to assimilate and to, you know, speak English very well. And they didn't see a conflict between, you know, keeping our Iranian roots, but also being fully, fully American. Right.
00:28:30
What is was what is the sentiment, though? What I'm trying to get is what is the sentiment amongst Iranian Americans? It's something that I'm interested in, people that fled this country for an opportunity. I mean, and you can say the same thing about this in terms of people that have fled from Cuba. I mean, there's so many different countries that people flee from. And then you get to America and you see people that are saying America is a horrible place to live.
00:28:50
America is a dictatorship. People that routinely can say horrible things about the president, who can threaten the presidents lives and, you know, the president's life, whether it's in jest or in sincerity and saying that they hope terrible things happen to the president and they're allowed to do that here because we have freedom of speech. Right.
00:29:06
And hearing them say that they're oppressed. Right. That they that they feel like they're living in a dictatorship. What is the sentiment amongst the community, people that have actually lived under systems of oppression?
00:29:17
I think there's there's I mean, this is a gross generalization. But if I were to kind of break it down for you, I think the majority of Iranian Americans, particularly those who either fled before the revolution, during the revolution or just after the revolution, they remember it very, very, very well. And they they they don't take anything for granted. Their children are all very, very highly educated. They've pushed their children to assimilate. They love this country and they want better for Iran.
00:29:44
And those are usually the Iranians that push for regime change. They're very happy, regardless of the political party, for any politician, any president, to push for regime change or to push for a better Iran. So they don't see, for example, when Donald Trump pulls out of the Iran nuclear deal in May of 2013, most of those Iranians that I'm referring to were very happy because they understand that it's a punishment for the regime and not the people, even though the people will be sanctioned.
00:30:08
The bottom line is that, yes, the sanctions are affecting the people, but only because the regime is allowing the people to face the burden of the sanctions.
00:30:16
And then also, even if you if you do the if you run the opposite argument, I mean, when Obama sent a billion dollars in cash to the Iranian.
00:30:23
The Iranian people didn't see that money. They know that right now, that's difference that's most important. So when I was growing up in Zimbabwe, there was no racial tension like, you know, animosity. It was all about reconciliation and everybody moving forward away from the past of colonization. So that's how he started out. But as time went by, the corruption that he had that he had instituted within the country, the minute his ministers were stealing millions of dollars from the people and his war veterans, they blew all the pension funds.
00:30:56
So now what was taking place was the economy was starting to fail and his way of taking attention off himself was to start this Marxist rhetoric against the white farmers. So he started telling everybody that your problem is not me and my corrupt ministers. Your problem are the white farmers. They are the ones that have taken your land and this is your land. So you are the that's who you should be looking at and not me. So this is so playbook socialist.
00:31:24
It's actually the government is corrupt. The government is taking your money. But let me go ahead and start issues between the proletariat. Exactly. And the wealthy people. And that's what I start to see in the United States. And that's why it's so familiar to me. I'm just like, wow, OK, this is starting to play out again.
00:31:40
Yeah, actually. Right. When you were just saying that in the beginning it was only reconciliation, we need to move forward.
00:31:45
I thought of Obama because that was sort of like that was the guy crying the night that he won, being like, finally, we're all going to come together. We're going to move forward. Exactly. And not exactly what we got. Absolutely not. The same way his rhetoric started changing. Obama's rhetoric started changing and becoming more about black versus white.
00:32:04
It's a natural way in which humanity trends when there isn't a sense of morality and morality. As soon as morality is developed and understood, you immediately move towards tribalism. And so that that is that is the great miracle. That is the Greek miracle right there. That was a part of the Greek miracle, Judeo-Christian values. And that's the thing that we have to be so grateful for. So we know all of that. Right. And yet when I'm walking down the street in Washington, DC, here, I look up and it's let's go the opposite direction.
00:32:32
It's my life's passion to speak to pastors to to reverse this. I go across the nation doing this. And what is it that I'm doing? I'm asking them to get back to really believe what their Bible says and let it rip. When I say let it rip, I mean go into that pulpit on fire, having prayed and studied. Don't get your sermon from some guy online. Don't say, Lord, bless my scrambled eggs and the message today, I'm talking about get your heart on fire, know what you believe and and preach it and teach it, because it's true.
00:33:07
We're flawed people. We're broken people. We need God's grace, his forgiveness. We need the love of Jesus. We need the cross and that empty tomb. Once that settled, truth never changes. Truth is truth. And it's not that I think it was Ronald Reagan that said he kind of lovingly rebuked somebody who said we need God on our side. And Reagan turned and said, we don't. We need to get on God's side. That's the side that we need to be on.
00:33:34
And so I just believe, Candice, that it's not too late that if pastors in a community starting this Sunday began to preach and teach from the Bible, which I believe is always relevant, they're going to address issues, even though if it's about the cross or it's about Martha pouring the ointment on Jesus's feet, you can work that in to the fact that this is what's going on in our local schools. And this is how that applies today. If we say that and I believe the Holy Spirit is saying that we could we could see a change in our nation.
00:34:13
Like this, and it is called revival, it happened in the first awakening in America and awakening like an awakening. And look, you and I geographically are not we're not far from the Azusa Street Revival that broke out in California and made history. The Jesus movement. It started the hippies. You're way too young to know this, but the hippies were stoned, free sex everywhere Haight Ashbury was going on. And they woke up to the fact that, you know what, we're killing ourselves.
00:34:43
And there were people just reading out of the Bible publicly in Huntington Beach in Costa Mesa, and kids sat down and listen to the Bible. And there is a cultural change. That was 40 years ago. We need to get back to that, even if black Americans are aware and know their history.
00:35:00
Right. And you can get black conservatives who understand the history much more, who understand, you know, the ills of the left and what the left has done. But still, in that regard, they bring to the conservative side the same bad habits that I was hoping black conservatives would be abandoning.
00:35:16
And what I'm talking about, number one, is conflict resolution. Black Americans do not know how to resolve basic conflicts. Everything has to turn into a fight. I hate you forever. You have to draw lines. It's like you're this gang or that gang and you still see it happening in politics.
00:35:33
They hate him. These is big everywhere, I guess, because we come from the hater culture, like you said, conflict resolution. Right. Me personally, I had a guy that shot at me, right, five times in broad daylight at my old school in Queens, and that same guy, he ended up getting arrested, did five years. That same guy I see five years later in Jamaica and Queens. And I guess he's like he got he's basically like I was if he saw a ghost.
00:36:06
So I guess he thought I was over. I said, brother, look, you did five years wrote. Like, if you're not over it at this time, then I wouldn't know what to say, I'm overborrow. I don't. You didn't kill me. You didn't kill nobody. I know at the end of the day, we're both alive. The best thing we could do is just is just leave it alone. Do you know that same person used to come to my studio that I built him up?
00:36:30
Am I am I in my community for people to come in and, you know, have free studio time? I taught them engineering how to be able to record themselves so they wouldn't need anybody. And he's like my brother now, like literally it's like my brother. Like, if I call him and I say I have some drama, he's going to come and handle anybody. But even though I never try to entertain. But the whole point is we can solve issues.
00:36:55
The Mafia, they could the guy could have killed his brother two weeks ago, but because of the bigger picture, they will come together and a tape would actually have a conversation to make sure nobody else does. And I think a lot of times we get so caught up with our emotions that we don't look at the bigger picture. Right at the end of the day, if I go and hurt him, there's somebody that loves him, too, that's going to hurt somebody out in cycles, is going to keep going and going.
00:37:20
Who who's going to end that cycle? We have to have one person in our mind and say, you know what? I am going to continue to cycle and because there is this ignorance, I think Scott Adams actually caused this like the nonexperts problem when you're not an expert, so you don't have the information to be able to accurately assess what's happening. And this is exactly what they're doing. Jeffrey Epstein, we are like, well, something's happening.
00:37:42
He's been arrested. But you're saying that you looked at this, your lawyer, you read these documents and you're going actually, we're just going to say, you know, you can't there's a girl you gave him. She's 15 years old and you got a massage and that's poo poo on you, right? I mean, that is ridiculous. Right?
00:37:55
And they know the media is going to cover it up to. So nobody in the media has put the heat on like this is nothing. Literally. You read this and you're like, this is maybe five years prison, maybe five years.
00:38:06
And that's that's why the idea that Jeffrey Epstein, who anybody who's met him, has told you he's not really human and the sense of he's just a cold blooded sociopath.
00:38:17
Right. So you and I like right now, if somebody kicked in the door and pointed a gun at us, we'd be like, oh, we'd be a little startled.
00:38:22
A true sociopath with Epstein doesn't have a fear response.
00:38:26
So that's why when I said every image, he sort of looks like he was confident and calm. And I was like, what is this? Right.
00:38:32
It's physiological. The sociopath of that nature doesn't have the fear response that other people have. They're literally wired differently. So the idea that Jeffrey Epstein is sitting in the cell so afraid what's going to happen to dude's got he's sitting in the cell thinking I 500 million dollars, which, by the way, we don't know where that came from. I for a million dollars compromising material on everybody, including Bill Clinton. And gosh, knows who else.
00:38:58
I'm going to kill myself. Yeah. Well, you know, go back to what you just said, because that's actually very interesting. Jeffrey Epstein, Epstein had 500 million dollars and we don't know what his source of income was.
00:39:09
No, we don't know who his private broker was. We don't know who any of those people who did the trades were. We don't know who worked for him and his hedge fund. It was very much like Bernie Madoff. So Bernie Madoff for years was this great trader. And anybody who looked into it go, well, I mean, here's how it goes back to again. If I came in here and I said, I don't use a microphone for a podcast, you would just say, like, OK, you're not there's something wrong with you.
00:39:33
Right? So if you're if you're managing five hundred million dollars, you're going to have a research analyst, you're going to have multiple analysts and they're going to like do investment advice, but you're going to have a whole floor of traders.
00:39:45
You're going to have what's called a prime broker who gets you your money and you're going have a market maker who sends up the trades and you're going to have just a Bloomberg terminal.
00:39:53
You're going to have all these things.
00:39:55
Madoff didn't have any of that people like. Well, that same thing with Epstein, he didn't have any of those things that you would have because it isn't like 500 million dollars. You just pick up the phone to ETrade. Hey, bro, I want to move one hundred million dollars an Apple stock.
00:40:10
It just doesn't work that way. So where to get his money? We don't know. We still don't know. Where did he pay his taxes?
00:40:17
Where of his tax returns? Just you name it. Right? As usual, I was on a Sherlock Holmes book. I read all the stuff years ago. And one of the archetypes that her metaphors involve is called like the Dog Who Didn't Bark. And I don't feel bad. Spoiling the book for people is over 150 years old.
00:40:34
But there's a mystery and you're always like, well, how do we know who did it? And then at the very end, you know, you get these revelations. Well, the one story, they're like, well, how do we know who broke in? And they said, well, the dog didn't bark. The only reason the dog wouldn't have barked is because it was the owner who did it. Yeah, right.
00:40:51
And so what I'm always looking for and these kind of cases in detective work, it's not what they show me.
00:40:58
I'm like, what dog isn't barking, right? So the police had told me, because, again, we weren't under their jurisdiction, if you can't find Gardy and they offered to sell you a child by the child, go through with the deal.
00:41:10
Let them conclude this deal, which will give us the evidence we need to then take this place down and then we'll really be able to find guardi.
00:41:17
So at this point, I have to pick a child to buy in a sting operation. And I'm looking around and I actually have the undercover footage.
00:41:26
You can see this because I had another guy with me. There's two of us that walked in. And so he caught me as I'm looking for this kid, who am I going to buy?
00:41:32
And this beautiful little boy who's about probably two years old. He he basically picks me. And he walks up to me and I just hold this little boy in my arms and I said, OK, he's he's the one I'm going to I'm going to buy.
00:41:52
I take him in my arms and I walk in to some of the outbuildings while my colleague is keeping the traffickers occupied, negotiating a price and so forth. And so I'm looking in. I got my camera to pick up any other faces, any other children. And as I'm walking into this dark outbuilding on this premises, it's dirty, smelly, evil place.
00:42:11
I hear the footsteps of another child who's following me. And I swing around and there's a three year old girl. And. She. I'll tell you in a minute why I'm getting so emotional, there's a reason. And she she's looking at me and she's looking at him, and I want to kind of get her out of the way, I don't want to create, you know, a lot of attention around what I'm doing.
00:42:37
So I give her account candy bar. Now, these kids are all we find out later. And I could tell in the moment all of them are on the verge of starvation.
00:42:44
And I give this little girl a candy bar. She's never seen a candy bar. And I said, take this outside. You can eat it outside. And I have children. I know that they respond to that. This little girl did something I had never seen any child do. She took the candy bar, she broke it in half, almost like muscle memory, not even thinking without taking her eyes off. The little boy in my arms breaks that candy bar and a half and hands the other half to the little boy.
00:43:09
And I just knew I mean, God told me in that moment, they're related. They're brother and sister.
00:43:14
All they have is each other. That's it. And I'm. And what have I done? How many Americans have come down to this place, picked up a child and that child disappears forever and this little girl is not going to let that happen.
00:43:25
And so I broke the cardinal rule of undercover operators in that moment, this first and last time I ever did it, I I knelt down. I put the little boy down right. When I put him down, she grabs him and protects him from me, which was the sweetest thing. This little girl, just my hero.
00:43:40
And then I broke this rule by telling them who I was that I am here to help them. And then they need to help me and just go along with what I'm doing and we will get you guys out of here.
00:43:52
And she knew this girl's brilliant. She's she's gifted in a way that most children aren't. And so she does. And she goes along with this. We end up getting the kids out. We buy those kids in a sting operation, in a sting deal.
00:44:05
We had to go to another hotel that we had set up where we had cameras wired to make sure we got all the dialogue and all the evidence we needed.
00:44:13
It went off perfectly. The traffickers got arrested.
00:44:17
They liberated the orphanage, the false orphanage. And little girl, of course, wasn't there.
00:44:22
And but the father I told you about, the father is the father of this little boy who I met, who I made the promise to that we would never he's a pastor of his congregation who was Christian Church. I promised him that we would never stop till we found his son. He's waiting in another hotel for the good news.
00:44:41
He's waiting for me to walk through the door with his son in my arms.
00:44:43
And we all knew that was going to happen. We believed it. And I still had hope at this moment when the police raided the the front orphanage that Gardy would be there.
00:44:53
And about thirty minutes later, they called me with the devastating news that he's not here.
00:44:59
And I had to go back and tell this man what happened.
00:45:02
And it was the most difficult and most inspiring conversation I've ever had with a human being. I went back, sat down with him.
00:45:09
He was in the lobby of the hotel and without saying a word, he just breaks down. I break down.
00:45:13
We're just sobbing without even exchanging any words because he knew that I didn't have a son. Yeah, but I did eke out the words to him what we did. We did get twenty eight kids out.
00:45:27
And then he did the most amazing thing. He slaps his hand on the table and he pops his head up in his tears are trying. I'm still crying. He's not.
00:45:34
And he says, stop crying. This is amazing. I said what's amazing. He said, You just told me we rescued twenty eight kids. I said, yeah but I'm worried about the one we didn't get. And he says, No, you're missing it. If Gardi hadn't been kidnapped, none of those kids would have had a chance. His kidnapping led to this. And I thought, wow, you know, I couldn't say what you're saying were roles reversed?
00:45:58
And then he said this. The most profound thing anyone's ever said to me.
00:46:01
He said, if I have to give up my son so that those 28 kids could be rescued. And that is a burden I'm willing to bear. Is there really fearful about the direction that the school systems have taken? And we saw this obviously happening? You and I have done a lot of, you know, a lot of public speaking about this. What would be your advice to them as a mother now? You know, you're much more tethered into the discussion about what they should be doing with their children, even not even just in grade school, because that's how young the indoctrination start.
00:46:30
But even through to college, what would be your perspective on that? Well, what I think parents need to realize, and I know I'm a new mom, so I'm not trying to say, oh, I have all the wisdom for, you know, the moms with five kids with teenagers and things like that. I understand I have very limited experience. Thankfully, I have sisters in law. I have a lot of women in my life who have a lot of children, have a lot of experience that I've been able to to learn from and just from being engaged in the culture like you are have been able to see some of the trends that you're talking about.
00:46:58
I was interviewing someone the other day who said something very poignant and true that the the battleground of ideas doesn't start in middle school or high school or college like we used to think it does. It starts on the playground. It starts when they're three years old. It starts at preschool. It starts in the nursery rhymes that they are listening to and the things they're watching on Netflix. There's an ideology that is being pushed behind so much of the content and the conversations that are surrounding our young children.
00:47:25
So my encouragement to moms, especially Christian moms, that's just the perspective that I have, is start preparing your kids, your babies, your toddlers right now, reading the things that you want to read them, start teaching them about the Bible, about God's word, about who created them, who created the heavens in the earth. Start laying that foundation right now and I can talk about it a different time or provide in a different way different resources that I think moms can be using.
00:47:50
But just make sure that right now, especially when your kids are at home before they are gone for eight hours a day at a school to make sure that you lay the groundwork for the Christian values or whatever your values are for your children, start shaping their minds right now so that they're equipped. My other piece of advice that I would have, again, is an inexperienced mom. But as a mom who sees what's happening in government schools, get your kids out of government schools.
00:48:14
There is a wonderful pastor by the name of Votebank, and he has talked about just the indoctrination that happens in public schools. And he says, you know, you can't send your kids to Caesar and be surprised when they come back. Romans and it's true when you send your kids to government schools with a government ideology, which happens to be a left wing ideology, so much of the time they are going to they are going to be affected by that and possibly infected by that.
00:48:42
And so the question for the parent is, do you want to battle with that? Like, do you want to battle with the ideology that your child is learning for eight hours a day when you spend two hours at home with them? And probably not.
00:48:55
And looking at this coronavirus situation, I was shocked to see people that I deeply respect on the right falling for this. They were they I mean, they were so scared. And what the left did is they finally found something that even conservatives who understand why we need to have our freedoms are afraid of. And that's death.
00:49:11
You know, the left needs today the politics of fear. This is kind of why they try to whip us into a frenzy all the time. See, Marx thought you wouldn't need any of this. Marx thought that the revolution was scientific. It would come automatically. You don't even have to fight for it because it's going to happen by a law of history. But nowhere did the workers revolt against the capitalist class. Not in Marx's time, not to this day, anywhere in the world.
00:49:34
So the left has realized Marx was wrong about that. There's nothing scientific about socialism. What we need is panic. So FDR discovered in the depression. I can do all kinds of stuff that I could never have done if we weren't in this Great Depression.
00:49:48
And then since the 70s, the left is like we're running out of food in the 80s, nuclear apocalypse in the 90s. The ozone layer is going away. The last twenty years, climate change, the oceans are rising and now coronaviruses. The theme is the same.
00:50:02
We want to take rational people and create a crowd stampede because crowds behave differently than rational individuals in the crowd. If you can get people to think that their lives are in danger and they have to run, then they behave in ways they do, things they submit to irrationality. And the left thrives.
00:50:22
Not only was I faced with personal harassment from wanting to study Western civilization institutionally, we were set up to fail from the get go. So like I said earlier, it's like a rubber stamp approval to get to get approval on campus. They were like, well, because so many people are against this, so many people I mean, like 50 50 people are against this. We are going to hold town halls on this issue. So our O'Shay approval was delayed a month.
00:50:51
We then had to go to two town halls that were probably like 200 people in your town hall. And we just had to listen to people's questions and comments on why they didn't think the club should exist.
00:51:02
Give me some sample questions.
00:51:03
So, yeah, so. So and some comments.
00:51:06
So the best would be and I think the ones that I feel unsafe having this club on campus, that it's it's an atrocity. And I don't feel like I belong at Trinity with a Churchill club on campus. We were accused of having a brother money.
00:51:27
That's my favorite accusation that I do get that all the time. All the time. And I just want to say I'm not against taking their money, but I don't I how they get it, you know, I mean, like I'm just saying, like, I'll take the Koch brother money, but like, it's a weird thing when you're conservative, you get there's yeah. They're like the coca, the money. It's like it's like what is that.
00:51:42
Yeah, I think it's the craziest argument. And this is what mostly the faculty would make is that we were essentially taking money from the Koch brothers and then we were using it to run this club to then rig elections like student government elections. And I'm like, where did that idea come from? Like, we literally just want to have like two dinners a year and like read books. Like, first of all, where does that come from? And to like, how is that?
00:52:06
Like, can we talk about the issue of Western civilization, right. Like like let's get back on track and like, they just wouldn't. So those were like a lot of the town hall questions.
00:52:15
Most people made the same question over and over again. So everyone would come up and be like, Western civilization is white supremacy. They said that in our mission statement, we said expansion. They took that as like logit, like domestic terrorists, expansion like like like KKK stuff. I'm like, what are you talking about?
00:52:34
Like we're reading books. Like we put expansion in there because I think we we wanted to expand our knowledge and expand our our horizons with it.
00:52:43
It's a dog whistle French and the word expansion is a dog whistle for wanting to expand your club into a cell for the Ku Klux Klan. Right.
00:52:50
I mean, it just it just gets out of you can't even make it up like. So then it got so then what happened was after that, I mean, they were like super. I just sat there and I was just like, this can't be happening like like this can't be like real.
00:53:04
But it was so me and a few other club members, we decided that let's meet with the people that are voting on this to approve us. I feel like I'm a pretty personal person.
00:53:15
I feel like if I talk to some people, maybe I can understand what the real issue is and maybe we can talk about it and talk it out. I was naive, obviously, but. But I mean, so so I get in there and I thought we had a pretty productive conversation. And I was talking about the things with you, which is that I recognize the hypocrisy in some ways that Western civilization has had. But every day Western Civ strives to to correct those mistakes and to move forward.
00:53:43
And I think that, you know, the freedoms that we have right now are given to us by that our ability to sit in this room and have this conversation and debate. Western civilization can only happen because of Western civilization and just no one really got it. So we even talked about changing some of some of our mission statement or just changing the wording just to kind of get it over with. And they wouldn't even budge on that. So we kind of realize it like they don't care.
00:54:10
This isn't about us, actually, like. This isn't about us reading books. This isn't about us doing anything, it's that professors, administrations, and this happens all over the country and have conditioned students to believe that Western civilization is bad for no apparent reason, just in a way to just gain power over the narrative that they want.
00:54:31
I got cured for my epilepsy. And actually that's the reason.
00:54:34
Now, the joy of this thing is that I, I have this new life that I wasn't going to have.
00:54:42
I'm on extra time already because this time wasn't supposed to be mine. And it means I can live utterly. I don't have things.
00:54:50
I don't have a home. I can't have savings. They'll come for that. I don't have things. And also I don't have fear.
00:54:57
And because of that, I'm probably one of the most free people on the planet, potentially, because the two things that limit people are the wish to preserve the things they have. So a home or a job or a family or a wife or a husband and the wish to preserve life.
00:55:18
And I haven't got financial stuff anymore because I can't have it in the UK and my life is already an additional extra. So so I get supercharged. And so that's why all of this is fun. And I think it's part of the reason I can find the funny a lot. Right, because it's very freeing.
00:55:38
Well, I totally agree with you. I mean, I feel in many ways the same way. And I think humor is so important.
00:55:46
And a lot of times you find in political space, people take themselves way too seriously, seriously.
00:55:50
And I have people that like, hey, I'll make fun of someone genuinely making fun of them. That's funny. And people get super upset about it. And just like, how could you make.
00:55:58
I'm like, how can you go through life taking yourself so incredibly seriously when life, you know, life hand everybody just a bad a bad deck of cards and you have to be able to laugh yourself, do it, especially in politics.
00:56:12
You've got especially in politics and we need to laugh more. And that's kind of my ambition from here.
00:56:17
I broke in her vibe just by going through quarantine because I'm not allowed to be here. So we're harboring a criminologist.
00:56:24
You bring me an Ebola ridden British woman who's obviously a Nazi and a fascist and a sexist and many of those things. But I won't leave and I intend to cause as much problem to the left as I can while I'm here. And I intend to do as well with a sense of fun because there is much to laugh at and with. We need to laugh at ourselves much more. We need to laugh at the things that threaten us like Black Lives Matter.
00:56:53
You know, water is wet. Just shout back at them, lie on the floor, prostrate yourself more than they can kneel.
00:56:59
And I think by humor we win. You know, humor is one of the most powerful tools that we have.
00:57:04
They are able to not only make you miserable, but get you to fight for your misery. We got black Americans to fight for their misery and we get women to fight for their misery and Jewish people to fight for, you know, and they're able to do that. They got Jews to hate Israel. They did. It's incredible. It's incredible. Incredible. You sound like, wow. I mean, and I'm sitting here arguing with them, trying to say, just ask questions.
00:57:27
You know, I'm not here to pretend to be an expert, but I know what you know there. The world was always ugly. So why why is it only matter? And it's only relevant when you go back in history. It's like. But Jewish people but Jewish people. I'm like, do you know what this world was? We are none of us are without sin, actually, to to to think that is a godless position. It's a godless position to believe.
00:57:47
Well, it is godless. And this was this was one of the great important moments of my life. When I was at graduate school, I was walking around Columbia, Midtown Manhattan, Upper Manhattan, and I was going crazy because my teachers were teaching me drivel, nonsense, true nonsense. And I kept thinking, why are such bright people? It's teaching me nonsense. And all of a sudden I've gone to Yeshiva, which is Jewish school all day long.
00:58:17
Half the day in Hebrew, religious subjects have been English. Secular subjects have very strong grounding. So we would open up in first grade with some prayers. Usually they were verses from the Bible in Hebrew. I had said this verse since second grade and it came to me in graduate school out of nowhere. That's why I called them Evony. And that answered my question and changed my life, all of a sudden the verse came back to me in Hebrew, I won't bother saying it in Hebrew.
00:58:46
Wisdom begins with the fear of God from the Bible. And I said, Oh, now I know why. There's no wisdom at Columbia, there's no God at Columbia. And that has stayed with me. To this day, the secular world has no wisdom. They have knowledge, there are very kind people there, there's no question they were secular, kind people. Absolutely, but there's no wisdom coming from the secular world. That doesn't mean all religious people are wise, there were religious fools, but all wisdom comes ultimately in the Western world from the Bible based world that we had, that Lincoln didn't go to church, but he read the Bible every night and he was a very wise man.
