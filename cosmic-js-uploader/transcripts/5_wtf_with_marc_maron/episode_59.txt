00:00:12
So, Larry King, I get an opportunity to interview Larry King. Larry King is Larry King. Larry King's like it's like a basic element. He's a basic media element. It's like he's one of the things that seems to have always existed as he is. He's he's pure. He's Larry King.
00:00:31
I got the opportunity. I didn't I figured, OK, I'll do it. Is he coming over? No, he's not. I got to go to his house, OK? I'll go to his house.
00:00:38
It didn't really it didn't really turn out the way I wanted it to for for reasons that will become clear. I don't think he knew who I was.
00:00:49
And that's fine. Look, I'm humble. I get a lot of people don't know who I am.
00:00:53
But I was going to his house and there was an issue when I got to his house. And this is what happened at the door.
00:01:05
Hello, how are you? How are you, Mr. King? What do you mean? Excuse me, 10 o'clock. I had 10 15. Oh. That's what I was going to do an hour, but you don't. All right, sorry. Whatever you want. Are to do that. OK. If you're not into it, I don't have to do it in five minutes, so so that's what I was dealing with.
00:01:38
That was that was the tone of the situation. Yeah. I wasn't like I got the information, but like right away I was like, man, you know, we can do this another time or not at all, if that's what you want.
00:01:50
You know, I just want to have a conversation.
00:01:52
So that's what I dealt with at the door. And now and then I was sitting in his living room. I was just sitting there and just waiting for my setup, took me the few minutes that I told them would take them. I'm just sitting there and here. Here was and some of, you know, I'll I'll talk to myself if I'm in the car and I got the mic on or I'm in someone's living room waiting to talk to them.
00:02:15
So here's here's me talking to me apparently while I was waiting for Larry.
00:02:28
So I'm sitting here in Larry King's house. He thought I was supposed to be here at 10:00. I came at 10, 15. That's what I had. And he was mad, so. Told them would take me five minutes to set up, that was five minutes ago, so I don't know what I don't know what's going to happen here. But. I guess we'll see. Just wait and. I told them we didn't have to do it.
00:02:57
Uh. But that's. That's where I'm at right now. I don't know if he's making me wait. As punishment. But I don't know that this is a. If this is going to work out. Because I'm, you know. I can get angry to. Hello, sir, I apologize for the miscommunication, Margaret. It is Mark, I want to here. Sure. OK. It's nice to meet you. Same here, and I apologize for being late.
00:03:50
All right. It's all right. We're going to we're going to be all right. Yeah. So as a as a guy who interviews people, I'm a guy who interviews people.
00:03:59
And, you know, I don't I don't have a particular style.
00:04:03
But for you, what what is it that you're looking for immediately?
00:04:08
Information. Yeah, I think the purpose of an interview is to draw the guest out. Yeah. Listen to answers. I think listening is as important as what the question you ask, I think to be intensely curious. I can't give someone I couldn't teach interviewing. Sure, you have to be intensely curious to begin with. I'm insatiably curious. Binnaway away all my life when I was a kid, I get on a bus and as the bus driver, why he wanted to drive a bus.
00:04:39
You don't want to sit next to me on an airplane. I'm asking questions all the time. So basically my 56 years in the business. Yeah, they're paying me for what I would be doing anyway.
00:04:50
So you were the kind of kid that, you know, you walk down the street, you see a guy just working or you walk into a diner and you want to know why they do what they do.
00:04:58
I was a y kind of person who, what, where, when, why. I listen to answers. I left my ego at the door.
00:05:06
I think of my whole career. If I used the word I five times, it would be a lot. I never felt I was important. I accept as a transmitter, I was a conduit to the audience. I try to ask the kind of questions that people I thought would be interested in. I mean, when did you realize that?
00:05:26
When did you understand that about yourself, that you were going to let your ego get out of the way? I don't know.
00:05:31
When that happened, I. I thought I'd be a sports announcer. I was always an avid sports fan. I wanted to be a broadcaster all my life. I never wanted anything else. When did you first realize that?
00:05:41
When I was six years old, I would listen to the radio and imitate radio announcers.
00:05:44
I would. Who is your favorite radio announcer? I like Red Barber doing the Dodgers. Arthur Godfrey was a hero. I got to work with both of them later in life. And where'd you grow up?
00:05:54
Old Brooklyn, New York. And I would go around to radio stations. I would go on watch radio shows. I used to pretend I was an announcer. Yeah, honest. I would go into elevators in the buildings where there were radio stations. And I would say to the elevator operator, you know, third floor, please, and I just want to be an announcer. I had a bunch of our jobs until about age twenty two and a friend recommended I go to Miami, I thought to be a sports announcer.
00:06:20
I was a disc jockey, news man, started on a small station. You grew up. And then one day, yeah, I was hired to do a show at a restaurant.
00:06:29
Popular restaurant. I did a morning, I did my own disc jockey show and then I'd go to the restaurant, do an hour show from the restaurant. And one day Bobby Darin walked in and Mack the Knife was the number one song in America. I had no idea he would be coming. Yeah. And I so I couldn't plan for him and I got to like that. I like the promptness of it. I liked off the top of the head.
00:06:54
I like being to start the cold. I would like to do interviews where someone walked into the room.
00:07:00
I didn't know who they were. Sure. And then famous people started to come in.
00:07:03
Jimmy Hoffa. Jimmy Hoffa. Ed Sullivan. Yeah. Oh, I've scooped Danny Thomas. A slew of famous people in the Miami Herald started to write about it. So I fell into interviewing. I never really thought about my style much. I never I never said to myself, I'm going to leave my ego at the door. I just. Felt that I was so curious about what the guest was, the guest count counted to me, I wasn't irrelevant, but I'll be there tomorrow.
00:07:34
Sure, my name was on the show, so the guests counted.
00:07:37
Did you ever get intimidated or frightened at times during interviews where you didn't know if it was going your way or where you felt like you were?
00:07:45
The only time I was ever intimidated was the first time I did Frank Sinatra because I've been such a fan of his. And Jackie Gleason arranged for the interview and I was nervous. But I got over that in a minute. In a minute. First time in the White House, a little kind of an all of the White House. But that goes away because I learned a long time, like I learned my first day on the air that the person whose show it is is in control.
00:08:13
So whether I'm at the White House, whether it's the president or the mayor. Or the carpenter, sure, or Frank Sinatra. I'm in control. You're in control of this interview, not me. Right. So once you know that, once you know you're in control, there's nothing to be nervous about. Right. Right. Yeah, OK. Because you're in control.
00:08:34
And also, don't you find that when you talk to people that they become people very quickly, despite what you may think of them or their public personality?
00:08:41
The mike disappears. The camera disappears. I never thought about how am I doing? Yeah, I never thought about yesterday's show or tomorrow's show today. I go always in the moment. Yeah. I felt right in the moment, the moment I was doing the first thing I was on the air, I was very nervous and nothing was coming out of my mouth. And I can remember to this day, it was May of 1957, really morning. And I couldn't think of anything to say.
00:09:06
And I thought my whole career was over. And the general manager kicked open the door and he said, this is a communications business. Yeah, you better communicate. And what I did was swear to God. I turned on the microphone, right, and said, yeah, this is my first day on the air. I've wanted this all my life. I've been sitting here for three, four minutes, scared to death. Yeah. So I just want to let you know that I'm nervous.
00:09:34
So what I did then, this is in retrospect, right? I brought the audience to my dilemma. Sure. OK, then nothing could go wrong after that. Because if I miscued a record of a commercial. Right, it's my first day. Right. And they knew it. So once they know that. Yeah. What am I going to be nervous about. Right. Cause I've taken them into my situation. Right.
00:09:57
And that was like the last time you used I that was that was one of the last. And also I've never after that was I got to say I was never nervous again. My first day on television, I wasn't nervous. I do a lot of speaking. I do comedy tours. I saw some comedy. Yeah, I tell funny stories, I, I like all of it. And I have never gone on a stage frightened because I know from that first day it ain't brain surgery.
00:10:23
Yeah. If the story's funny they're going to laugh. Right. They're not going to laugh. It ain't the end of the world.
00:10:29
That's a hard one to learn. No, no. I mean I don't know if you learn it.
00:10:32
I just. I just. You were able to frame it that way. I don't have the confidence in life that I have in broadcasting or on stage because I think it's a control issue. I have two young boys. They're fourteen and thirteen. One just started high school. One's still in junior high school. Yeah, I had to get up this morning and take one to work and one didn't want to have breakfast. I have to drop them off and now I don't know, my wife's going to say today and then I got a lunch to go to but I can't control that.
00:11:00
However. Yeah.
00:11:02
If I were broadcasting today. Right, I control that's so the best part of my day is when I'm working the easiest part of my day by far when I'm working. Yeah. Because I can't control life but I can control the situations of radio television speaking. I'm in control.
00:11:21
So how is it for you now bringing up young kids. Well, I have three grown. Yeah, I have a stepson. Yeah. And then I have two children.
00:11:30
The age of a grandfather. Right. But I'm a father. Yeah. So I got to go to baseball games. I got to take kids to school. Grandfathers don't do that. Right. Someone said the best part about being a grandfather.
00:11:40
If you get to go home, you don't get I don't get to go home. This is the most hands on you've ever been with all you. Absolutely. Oh, yeah.
00:11:49
Because I have more time with them. Yeah. Is it rewarding? I'm not running around making it. Mm hm.
00:11:54
Well there's a good and bad with the great part is to watch them grow and to see that both athletes and both kind of bright, very different night and day seven for being good athletes. There's not one thing they have in common. Definitely not one. Yeah.
00:12:10
And so watching that develop and then you think of your age, you know, and I was we go to all the Dodger games, you know, sitting the other night with my son and I had a vision that he'd be playing with the Dodgers and he's fourteen. And then I was him. I said, well, wait a second. Logically, if he went in after high school and he played a couple of years in the minors, maybe he'd to the majors when he.
00:12:34
Twenty four. Yeah. I would be then going to be ninety. So my fear was, would I be around.
00:12:40
Right. And so you had the problem of aging is you want to be around to see them grow up. Yeah. I hope you're going to be around. Yeah.
00:12:46
Was it was your choice to have kids at this age?
00:12:49
I didn't think I'd have. I just married a younger woman and she's much younger than I. And children, you know, children came. But it's a gift. It is a gift.
00:12:59
And we're both born. I didn't watch my other children born. They didn't allow in.
00:13:04
Well, it wasn't there. Didn't you have a son that you didn't really meet for a long time? Oh, that was a great story. Yeah. What happened? Yeah, well, I was married to this woman for a short period of time and we broke up. She said she was pregnant. I didn't know if it was mine. And then years later, I learned I had a child and he was in his early 30s and we got to meet and he says, if I raise them all my life.
00:13:27
Really? Yeah. So there was no contention.
00:13:29
Initially, he was amazing. And he met his brother and sister and he grew up with my name, Larry King Jr. He grew up in Miami.
00:13:40
He watched me broadcast Dolphin Games before he knew you were his father.
00:13:44
Oh, he knew he was my father, but he had a stepfather.
00:13:47
Right. Why do you wait so long to meet? You don't know.
00:13:50
Yeah, it just happened. And then his mother was dying and she called and said, you know, you have a son, you ought to meet him and he's about to get married. And I went down to Florida and then was living in Washington. I sent a lawyer down first, you know, and he called me up and he said that you can take a DNA book, but you're going to be throwing away money because this is your kid.
00:14:14
And I went down. Obviously, he was my kid and now he's, you know, it's like nothing. Yes. I feel like I raised them. Yeah. So it's it's a great story. Yeah. And it's one of them. I don't know if I'm proud of it, but I you know, that I shirk responsibility. I wasn't sure I even had a kid here, but she said she.
00:14:35
But, you know, I'm not a new. Not new. Right. Right, right. And you have kids now.
00:14:41
Oh yeah. I have three grandchildren as twins. That's so good. And then my son has those. My daughters got married.
00:14:48
Uh, how do you grow up? My father died when I was nine and a half. I grew up with a bunch of friends, three of whom are still my best friends. I grew up in Brooklyn, went to Dodger games, Jewish neighborhood at the time, a Jewish Italian mafia.
00:15:03
We didn't know what a Protestant was.
00:15:05
Yeah, well, you're religious. The family. I was bar mitzvah. My mother kept a kosher home. Oh, yeah. But I lost that a long time ago. I my father's death changed my life. I was very close to him. And then I lost interest in school. I never went to college. My younger brother went to law school.
00:15:25
He's still around. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
00:15:27
Seventy six guys got good genes, surprisingly, because my father died at forty six of a sudden heart attack and my mother lived to seventy six. I always thought that I would die at forty six because he died of forty six. He smoked. I smoked.
00:15:44
Oh isn't that interesting. I knew I had a lucky heart attack. I was 53 of smoking three packs a day.
00:15:50
You miss him.
00:15:51
The cigarettes I know now but if I had an hour to live I'd smoke because it was a great habit. However, I got scared to death and never smoked again.
00:16:04
I had a heart attack on in February of 1987 and through this driving home, my daughter drove me home from the hospital and the cigarettes that I'd gone to the hospital with or in my pocket, I threw into the Potomac River and never smoked again and never reached for a cigarette nor wanted one psychiatrist. Friend of mine told me that what happened to me, fortunately, was I got scared to death. So much so that if I had, I never, you know, chewed gum or held toothpicks and that if I had a desire.
00:16:41
Yeah, the frighten me was so great. He went away. So I, I didn't reach for cigarettes in my pocket. That's spectacular. I was unbelievable. I was I don't even take credit for it. I was it was by osmosis, the heart attack.
00:16:56
What I mean when you had the bypass and everything else. Five months. I had the heart attack in February and the bypass in December.
00:17:03
Like what was the feeling after you get a bypass? It seems like I don't know anyone that had one. But there's a vulnerability that you feel a fragility.
00:17:10
Well, you feel a first. The amazing thing is you have the weeps. Yeah. Because a stranger moved your heart. That's a real thing. Yeah. They move you because they put you on a heart lung machine. The whole process of now a lot of it's much simpler. Yeah. This was, you know, in 1987, but I'm still close to my surgeon. Yeah. I started the Larry King Cardiac Foundation. We help people who can't afford to get heart help.
00:17:40
And he's the same surgeon who did Letterman. Cronkite did Regis.
00:17:45
But you get choked up about things. All right.
00:17:48
What happened is, yeah, after a couple of weeks, I went down to Florida and it was funny. I was on the plane with Alexander Haig. Yeah. And we're in the first class. And he had had heart surgery. And I started to cry. I didn't know I was crying. And the stewardess came over and he just said, don't pay any attention. It's the weeps and it must be the vulnerability.
00:18:10
What happened was and then I got real healthy, I, I lost weight. I most people, when they start, stop smoking, gain weight. I lost. Wait, I took care of myself, I watch what I eat still, yeah, I don't exercise much as I sort of walk a lot. Any chance I get to walk, I walk in the food you carry.
00:18:28
So I'm not super careful, but sure I, I'm, I'm five eleven.
00:18:35
I weigh 160. That's good. I was 190. Yeah. That's the most that way. It was I think when I had the heart attack when he stopped going to the deli.
00:18:44
I have my own we have our own bagel store now. It's called Brooklyn Water Bagel. It's that you franchise. Well I got the Beverly Hills on their spokesperson, so in return, I got the Beverly Hills franchise.
00:18:56
So you don't need to go to Nationals anymore?
00:18:58
No, I go there once a month for some mansaray because that's where I was one of my favorite foods.
00:19:03
Your mother make it sure. Yeah, my mother made it.
00:19:06
I mean, nothing like Jewish cooking are a fact of chef was here the other day. We did a TV show for her Internet show with Jeff Stone, Chris Stone, uh, and he was here and he was going over all the delicacies that he cooks in everything. Yeah. And I said to him, Are you going to cook the meat? Yeah, I said, I like it. Well done. And he goes, I can't cook that.
00:19:38
I said, just keep cooking. Yeah. I can't I will not cook that. Right. I said, why won't you cook that? Because he said, that's not food. Right. That's that's like a container you're eating, right. I said, no, it's my fault. I like I hate red meat. Yeah. I was raised. I just freeze. I can't stand to see meat. That's red. Yeah. So I'm, I'm kosher cooking.
00:20:01
I like I have no religion at all. Yeah. My wife's devout Mormon, devout, devout, goes to church every Sunday and the children I we had an agreement when we got married so I have no religion. Yeah. That she could raise the children. I think it's good ethics she raising them Mormon. Yeah.
00:20:21
My boy goes to Catholic school, Notre Dame High School. I'm glad to get grounded in a good faith. I have no I lost my faith in God a long time ago. And why the more I interviewed religious people. Yeah, but was there a moment. I never got answers.
00:20:38
No, no. You know, they couldn't they couldn't tell you for sure that there were I I'm a person.
00:20:44
Yeah. I, I have to know. No. And if you're a messenger of God I would ask them. I know the old story God gave man free will so he couldn't stop Hitler.
00:20:58
Uh, OK. All right. I'll buy that. He couldn't stop Hitler. How about Katrina.
00:21:02
Uh huh. It wasn't man's, which was man didn't. Mm hmm. And they don't necessarily always say the same. We we question not the ways of the Lord. Come on. Right. I question the ways the Lord. Then I remember when I was a kid, while I'm a social Jew, I love the I like being Jewish. I like Jewish food, Jewish humor. I gravitate toward Jewish people. Right. I like Israel. But the God of the Old Testament, I didn't like him slay my enemies.
00:21:38
Sure. Sure. I thought he was barbaric. Yeah. And I didn't like him and he wanted me to fear him. Yeah. And you're teaching me love and fear at the same time. And the Christian faith I could never bano.
00:21:53
But what about faith without the possible faith in what?
00:21:57
In just a human's goodness. I mean, I guess I, I wouldn't call it faith yet. I think probably came from the Bible. The do unto others is the only law you need. Yeah. Right, right. If you if you don't need any law on the books but do unto others.
00:22:13
Do unto others covers sheet and income tax. Red light murder. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:22:19
It's a good one. I don't like I think is what you do others as you would have them do to you don't pass the red light. Yeah. Right. Don't cheat on your income tax. Yeah. Don't screw around with people.
00:22:28
I think Carlin did a big bet on that. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. George was a friend of mine and we went over that a lot.
00:22:35
Well you know, there's that great joke about the rabbi, you know, in terms because I was brought up Jewish as well.
00:22:40
And I don't I don't really believe in God. But, you know, the joke about the rabbi walking down the street and it starts raining and then the water is rising up about two feet and some guys come by and, you know, in a car and I get in the car will take you to safety. The rabbi is like, no, no, God will save me. Then the water is up to his neck and he's treading water a little bit.
00:22:58
And some guys come by in a boat and say, Rabbi, get in the boat. You know, you guys don't worry. God will save me. And then now he can't tread water anymore. It's so high. The buildings are covered with water. A helicopter comes down a tall ladder, said Rabbi. Get on the ladder now. Rabbi goes, No, God will save me. And he drowns. And he gets to heaven. He says to God, Why didn't you save me?
00:23:17
And God says, I send a car, I send a boat.
00:23:20
And it's a tricky thing how you interpret that stuff.
00:23:25
I know, but I don't. I like I said, when your time is up, your time is up. Well, if you're on an airplane. Yeah, one of the pilots time is up.
00:23:34
You know why I didn't have anything to do with that. Jesus Christ. Maybe you can't see Jesus Christ, by the way.
00:23:40
You know how he got his name, how it was it was in the manger and they were trying to figure out a name. Yeah. And Joseph stood up and hit his head on the truck and Jesus Christ, it stuck it. Things like that got rhythm. Yeah, it does go in the first words. Sixteen the second. So the bagel joint was this was this a reaction to the lack of ability to find a good bagel in this? He came to me and they had this idea.
00:24:10
They started in Florida. Very good company, the franchising all over the country. And they said these we make the water. They make New York City's best water in America and they make the water in a lab. You see it in the restaurant.
00:24:22
They usually the machines are really to meet the match, the New York water. They match the New York water. They can boil the bagel in the equivalent of crayon. What's the difference? That's right. The theme is the differences in the water. So sort of bagel. Everyone who comes in says it. They're back in Brooklyn. Really? It's great. Bagels, great.
00:24:41
It's nice to know that. Do you think and now this is the question, do you think that because your father passed away at such a young age, that part of your interest and need to connect with people and know about them was some sort of certain may be true?
00:24:54
I never question that psychologically. I, I, I know I lost something in not having a father because all my friends had fathers and I was like the boy without a father. And maybe that led to the need for till I don't know where it came from. The love to broadcast did not because I wanted to be a broadcaster before he died.
00:25:18
And your first job was just on the radio. Was it a music show?
00:25:21
There was a I was a disc jockey, was an alternative station, small station. We had news, sports. I did everything. But I did I did a disc jockey show in the morning and then I did in the afternoon. I did sports news. And, you know, you learn the business from the ground up. Yeah. And then I got this interview show at a restaurant about two years later.
00:25:39
And that's when I started to wear one of those guys. I had to go all over the country at times to change the world was Miami I hate my whole career was twenty years in Miami. Then I got the national radio show you the first network talk show.
00:25:52
And then I always did local television, I did television, much of the radio, probably two years of radio and television started and I was there both. And then Ted Turner came along and I interviewed him a few. And he he liked my work and he had CNN that when they were five years old, I started on their fifth anniversary and he liked me and hired me and I didn't know what CNN was.
00:26:16
Yeah, I didn't have it in my home, but it sure took off.
00:26:21
And that was it. That was the game changer for you. Oh, sure. Well, the radio was a kick off because I got a lot of good write ups and a lot of stories about that radio show.
00:26:31
And that was why was it so why did you get so much attention? Because it was the first national network talk show, the beginning of talk radio. But I get a lot of credit as the beginning of talk radio in America.
00:26:42
You like what it evolved into?
00:26:44
No, because it became a soapbox screaming, yelling idiots. And a lot of what I hear is pop nonsense. Yeah. Political, no real desire, no real discussion to go crazy.
00:26:57
You know, NPR is good radio, but, you know, the Limbaugh's just playing with a loose deck and a lot of it's an act. So I know. Yet it's there.
00:27:09
There are some of the. I came to respect Howard Stern. Yeah, sure. I used to when I was earlier on, I didn't buy a lot of that act. But now I. I understand his maturity and he's matured. I think so. I think that's true. He's a very good broadcaster. But I was raised by the Godfreys and it was whenever someone curses on the radio still drives me nuts.
00:27:30
It just doesn't fit. Right. Right. It almost it's it's like a violation. Can a week for a second if I go to the men's room. Go ahead. OK, you're older. I'm looking forward to it.
00:27:44
What the fuck. Fuck, fuck. Fuck the fog.
00:27:56
OK, ok, good. Well I think I want to talk about a little bit.
00:28:03
Is your relationship with Jackie Gleason, how do you change your life?
00:28:09
When Jackie moved down to Miami to broadcast, I went up to New York and came down on the train with him and did interviews with him on a train. And then we had a big welcome, Jackie, to Miami dinner and I am seated. So I sat up on the dais with him and we got to be friendly and he'd call in to my radio show and he came home, my television show, and he said he didn't mentor me, but he he liked me.
00:28:40
And I made a big switch. I went from a Channel Ten to Channel four, uh, one from the ABC affiliates, the CBS affiliate. And he did all my promos. I mean, he was just terrific to me. Got Sinatra for me. Yeah. Senator owed him a favor, and that was the return to the favor. He was a pretty good like a huge personality was larger than life.
00:29:05
Everybody was powerful. Yeah. Hey, pal, I'm now he was at his house and yeah, he was gregarious.
00:29:13
He called himself a Roman Catholic. He was thought a lot about death that he the night before he died, we got a call from his PR guy. Yeah. And he made a list of people to call and say goodbye. This was very touching. He had Jackie understood human behavior. He liked my curiosity. And he he was a compelling person to be around because he understood poor. He understood being down, understood being broke, and he lived life larger than life.
00:29:58
And he he did. I loved the moment. I love being live in the moment. And he appreciated that. He worked like most of his life in television. I worked like most of my life and broke it anyway. They were doing The Honeymooners once alive musical for an hour at the Miami Beach Convention Center. And it was Saturday night and I was in the wings watching this show.
00:30:24
And he comes off stage for a minute and he says to me, call Raimondo's and tell him I want the spaghetti, but I want that La Dolce and beguiles ten seconds. He says, I want that wine. Five seconds, Jackie.
00:30:42
And they were doing this. And then suddenly he goes, what not he went from the new right where his line was right into the scene.
00:30:49
Yeah. And I went, wow. Yeah. He was just so he never rehearsed. He had this big fat guy who was a friend of his that did all the scenes in rehearsals and he'd watch that. And so he knew all the movements.
00:31:03
So he had a guy stand in for him, correct? And so when you appeared with him the first time you saw him, like Bing Crosby said, where is he? Yeah. And they do a skit. And then suddenly the night is like, yeah, Jackie would appear.
00:31:16
And do you think he did that to keep it fresh for everybody? Fresh. But he knew where. Yeah. Yeah. The layout. Yeah. He couldn't speak, couldn't understand, you know, the music get conductor orchestra. So those Capitol albums had an instinct. And he understood the broadcast instinct.
00:31:32
We sort of was a pioneer in television, I think. Right. Oh yeah.
00:31:36
Those The Honeymooners in those early shows that Jackie did, the characters he did the various one, Reggie Van Gleason, bartender and poor soul.
00:31:47
And I mean, he just he just was a tremendous guy to be around. And it was very sad when we lost him. And that the problem with this as youth goes on, my kids don't know. Yeah. You know, and you mention these names to people and anybody under 30, they don't know Jackie Gleason.
00:32:06
Is that sad and amazing. We knew I knew people. That was before my time. I knew the greats. Yeah. Like who you thinking?
00:32:15
You know, when I knew what I was, I knew Lowell Thomas H.V. Kaltenborn, Edward R. Murrow. But these kids today, they don't know Vietnam. Uh, you know what I'm talking about.
00:32:27
There's no there's no real historical context anymore because of 24 hour news. Eat it up. Spit it out. And also the Internet.
00:32:34
Nothing has any context. I mean, it's just pictures. It's just bits and pieces in and out.
00:32:38
And yet everyone is a journalist. Yeah. Everybody blog. Right. People the Twitter and. Yeah. Now there's a plus to that. Yeah. And Twitter could start a revolution. Sure. There's no privacy. That's terrible. However, the plus in that is they would have never caught the guys who started those blow ups in Boston if it hadn't been for cameras everywhere.
00:33:05
Privacy. Uh huh, yeah. But it's a it's a weird slippery slope, right?
00:33:09
Yeah. And that's what Obama faces here in that. Where do you draw the line. Yeah. Between when can I know what you're doing. If I if it's a different world. Right. We know for sure somebody is going to come up with a nuclear weapon. It's in your one hand and you could bring it into the country. So what do you do about that fear while you want to uphold the Constitution? And I'm a constitutionalist, so I don't want you invading my privacy.
00:33:41
Well, but on the other hand, you see, there's always on the other hand, however, Hitler made a famous speech in 1937 in which he said Germany was doing away with warrants. Yeah. When we come to your home, if the police come to your home, if you have nothing to hide when you worry about, but we're in great danger from enemy within in this country. And so why not let us look in your home if you and the German people bought that?
00:34:12
Yeah, I would bet that if you made that same speech in America today, 30 percent might say, yeah, I got nothing to hide. Right. I bet you're right or you're not me. Yeah. You're not coming into my house.
00:34:25
Well, the one thing the Constitution protects is that no matter who's in charge, you have those rights. See that that becomes the tricky thing. It's like right now you got a good guy in charge. But when they come looking for Jews again, when you give up your rights.
00:34:36
Right. That famous guy who said first Hitler said it was only the communists, right. Then he said it was only the Jews. Yeah. And then he said it was only the Catholics. Yeah. And then he said it was me.
00:34:47
Yeah. Right. Yeah. So when you.
00:34:50
But the weird thing is, is I went to Google the directions for here and you know, because you sold the house that you bought the house, it's on record is your house, you know, and you know you have that same problem. It's almost every five minutes.
00:35:02
Right. Almost nothing you can do about it. Nothing. People take pictures. Ellen DeGeneres lives two blocks up and no idea about the tour bus. She lives to live way up on top of the hill. They never got up that, huh? Now she lives on a street sort of near the flats. Yeah. And she's going nuts. She she's furious.
00:35:22
Yeah, she's mad. But you could do it. It's a public street. Right. And they go by and they take pictures. And I waved dinner one night and I said, what am I going to do? Be mad at people, what they're going to do about my house one night, my little boy, when he was ten. Yeah. Went out front and said, he's in the bathroom. I want to wait a minute. Did they.
00:35:42
They waited.
00:35:43
They waited. Or they sometimes see my car come back in the midterms. Yeah.
00:35:47
It's funny to watch but that's that's you know, and the Truman said if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.
00:35:56
So I chose a business in which if you do well, you get well known and.
00:36:02
And you pay a price. Mm hmm. So I think you owe something back for that price. In other words, the ballplayer owes the kid the autograph. Yeah, there's no law that says yes to give it to him.
00:36:17
But he was a kid. Mm hmm. And you're a ballplayer because somebody gave you that talent, whether it was God or whatever. You had this talent. I was given this gift of this voice or this courier who gave me I had this great Indian swami tell me once. Yeah. Who gave you this gift? Yeah, right. Yeah.
00:36:39
So it's a good way to live. It's impossible to live this way. But he said you don't believe in God or anything when you open your eyes in the morning.
00:36:49
Did you learn that to gift. Right. Give thanks or whatever. What do you believe. You didn't. You have the right to open your eyes in the morning. Yeah. So give thanks for that and then give thanks for everything that happens during the day. So if it's raining. Yeah.
00:37:06
Yeah. You know, you woke up. Yeah. Life's a gift. Yeah. Gratitude. If I didn't have the skill to hit a baseball and someone's paying me five million dollars to hit a baseball and a nine year old asked me to sign autographs. I'm too busy for that. Are you crazy. So I'm not going to smile for a tour bus and I'm living in this freaking house that if my mother and father saw this house, they would faint.
00:37:32
Yeah.
00:37:35
Yeah. I never you never forgot.
00:37:37
And that's what I liked about Jackie Gleason told me a great story once. The first appearance Elvis Presley ever made was on the Jackie Gleason summer rerun show hosted by Tommy Dorsey. And in order for an act to appear on the show, Gleason wanted to see them. Yeah. So he saw Presley came in like audition and he called them over and he said, Listen, kid, you're going to be famous, you're going to be real big. I want to give you a bit of advice.
00:38:01
Go out on stage, go out, talk to people, because if you stay and you're going to be the loneliest guy in the world, Jackie went out, always socializing.
00:38:16
Hello. How are Presley? Yeah, in the house. And look what happened. Died on the toilet alone. Alone. Sad.
00:38:23
Jackie went out. Yeah, he had a good time.
00:38:25
Jackie, Jackie. Jackie had a good time. Jackie. He knew how to drink. Mm. And he knew how to.
00:38:36
He wasn't a carouser like with women and things like that.
00:38:39
He was but he was. You like to stay up and party and he was genuinely afraid to fly.
00:38:45
Yeah but he flew. Yeah. To work with Laurence Olivier in London.
00:38:51
Uh huh. They did a two character show for HBO I on the way. HBO doesn't show it more often. Great story. I'm Jason. Love the script here. Olivia played an Englishman. His wife had just died.
00:39:04
Right? I kind of remember.
00:39:06
And the American Gleason went over for the funeral and Gleason had had a 25 year affair with that man's wife in a bar.
00:39:15
Yeah. And the whole hour is just the two of them. Was it great? It was great. And that's why he flew with all of you. Yeah. Out of all the people that you've known in your life and talked to outside of Gleason, who do you who do you find yourself thinking about a missing the most or not missing?
00:39:34
I've interviewed so many. Let me have seven presidents and Sinatra was alive.
00:39:39
It was interesting to be around because it was so complicated. Oh, yeah.
00:39:43
Oh, Frank, was did he not ever have a good time? Frank was unhappy. Yeah. Why? Because there was never enough in the set. Never nothing satisfy them when he was in a sad moment. Like you said to me once, you know, all my friends are dead. All my friends, it that was it was so sad. Oh, God. But he was never totally happy except when he was on stage.
00:40:10
And you don't think about it? Yeah, I think and this is understanding his phrasing.
00:40:15
And if he liked you, he could do no wrong. And if he didn't like you, you could do no right. He was there was no great life was black or white.
00:40:28
And I was lucky enough to be like maybe Rickles would say I said to Don, what if he didn't like them? And Don would go, You have relatives in New Jersey.
00:40:40
He's great.
00:40:41
How's he doing in your personal finances? All right. Yeah, I talk to him every once in a while. I'll see him every six months or so. We run into each other. He's an old different. He's still working. Yeah, he's 86 years old and died.
00:40:53
And I was sad when I heard about that, Larry. Yeah, yeah. But Don Don and Mel Brooks and all of them. I interviewed Mel. That was a great Caesar's house couple weeks ago because they said, start talking. Right.
00:41:05
You know, I see you. One of the guys that goes up there to say goes, I don't know. Now, Mel and Carl Reiner have breakfast every day at the same restaurant in Westwood and they're still Ariete together. Oh, that's great. They're great in your old. All the funny stuff happens. Funny stuff. They're living it now.
00:41:24
Yeah, they are. They're well, Mel is the funniest person I've ever known. Yeah. Because he's the classic Woody Allen is in that. But not as broad, huh, Mel, as the classic Jewish humor. Oh absolutely. A 12 year old man, if you listen to it carefully, was genius. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I played it with him once. Right. I went up to the New York World's Fair in 1964. The World's Fair was in New York, in Flushing.
00:41:56
Right. Flushing, Brooklyn, Queens. And I interviewed Mel. That's where I met him. And we played the twenty year old man and he'd go into it, like I said, do you want to play 2000? You just improvised it. Oh, I just said, yeah, we're here at the World's Fair. Yeah. What do you think? You're 2000 years old. He goes fair.
00:42:17
Fair. Yeah but you see, that's fair haired. Then he said to me, were you at the first fair you know, the first fair.
00:42:26
One hundred and eighty three people came the whole world and we held it in a ravine, in a ravine at the bottom of a ravine. And people rolled into the fair, which was one of the exhibits. I said, well, what could have been look, we have a monorail.
00:42:43
Yeah, monorail. We had the burning bush. We thought it was a ride. But his best line of all was what was I and what was the big hit of the. And 003. Yeah, yeah. The big hit was Moses. Moses parted the Red Sea. He did it two times Friday, three times on Saturday, four times every Sunday, six months. And he had a press agent who told him, You keep doing this, Moses, I'll get you ten, eleven pages in the old bus.
00:43:15
And that mine.
00:43:16
Yeah, that can go that quick. Yeah. So quick. And you not know where he's going to go.
00:43:23
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so I watch his mind and he still has that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Still has that. Oh yeah. He's very quick still. Yeah. I love being around him.
00:43:33
So I guess before we wrap up I again apologize for uh for the time mis communication but so marriage you believe in it.
00:43:44
Well obviously I've been to six seven marriage. I lost count I think one twice. Right. Seven one twice. OK, but I never live with a woman. I never like spending a night with a woman. I like to go home. And if I was in love, I got married. That's where I was raised. And I always felt when I meet people who are married like sixty years. Yeah. All the compromises they had to make.
00:44:10
Yeah. I didn't want to do that. Yeah. So what I loved the twenty is not what I loved at thirty and what I loved it. Thirty is. No I loved it. Forty. Sometimes I think back to people that I loved. What was I thinking. But I was crazy for them then. Uh and in that time when I grew up you got married. This marriage has lasted sixteen years. Maybe it's maturity. Maybe the difference in age is the fact that she was in show business.
00:44:42
What she do, she was a singer. Actress appeared in a lot of she opened for Rickles. Oh yes. Very good singer. And she was so she understood that if I had to go somewhere to do an extra interview, you know, she had her own show on USA Network, so she knew the business to do the business. Helped choose a backup singer for the Osmonds. Her father ran Capitol Records, so even though, like the devout Mormons, he also very show biz.
00:45:12
Uh huh, yeah, I understand. Sure. The business, which has helped me slightly lately and then having kids, of course. Good.
00:45:20
I look up at that picture as the door, and that's when they were three and two, I guess. Huh. So you got no regrets? No.
00:45:29
We go to Dodger Stadium and they know that stadium. They've been going there since babies, you know, like the back of my hand. Oh, yes. And they they run around, you know, the great or the different seats. They sure sit behind the dugout of the visiting team and they yell at the other players.
00:45:46
It's great. Great. Yeah. Oh.
00:45:49
Any regrets, huh? Grunts. Um. If I had one day back in my life, the day I started smoking, we yeah, sorry, I smoked.
00:46:08
That's not that's not too horrible. And I had of all the powerful people you met, couldn't name one.
00:46:17
But I mean, we ever say, like, let's talk presidents real quick and then we'll finish up. Who surprised you the most as a person, both for better or worse, out of the seven and six.
00:46:27
I'll run them down. Yeah. Nixon so bright. Yeah.
00:46:30
And yet hung up. Yeah. Little things bug me. George Bush the first best guy in the world. Yeah. Nicest, sweetest care about you. Concerned guy George Bush to great baseball. Yeah I he invited me to the White House once. Yeah. Off the record. Yes. No interviews, no nothing. We sat down for two hours. Talk baseball. Yeah. Let's talk baseball. That was I had just gotten to Washington so he says, hey, I got to go to California.
00:47:03
You want a lift. I said, no, I just got here. He saw cheese. We could talk baseball.
00:47:08
We were talking baseball. That goes Reagan for his humor. And the best of all, from an interview standpoint, Clinton was a steel trap mind. I like Jimmy Carter first of his, how much he cared about little things and detail. Gerald Ford was a great guy, just a good guy to something to like about everyone.
00:47:32
Yeah. Obama for his mind, like like Obama's mind and his he's so well within himself.
00:47:42
By that I mean, he he's very inhered in himself. He's not going to wrap his arms around you. Clinton's going to hug you. Yeah. Yeah. So I like them all.
00:47:53
But the most incredible person probably was Mandela. Yeah. Because he was such a single, solitary, incredible figure still around. I had one of the great days of my life was I went to his house. I was in South Africa speaking tour and I went to his house for lunch and I had dinner with the clerk. No man who freedom. So his little Larry. The little Jewish kid from Brooklyn. Yeah, I'm with Mandela. Yeah. And the clerk.
00:48:24
Yeah. On the same day.
00:48:26
But I was at Jackie Robinson's first game and I interviewed him. And so I've lived through through history and. And I've been on this journey, I wrote a book called My Remarkable Journey, and I pinch myself, I pinch myself every day. I was on relief as a kid. My father died in New York City, bought my first pair of glasses. So I sit around and look at me, and yet I'll complain if the plane is late.
00:48:55
What am I doing? I got to run. All right. Thanks, man. You haven't done the up.
