This is my podcast. This is WTF, the podcast with the name and the profile pic that that pic, the WTF. What do you call that avatar or a thumbnail or whatever the hell it is on iTunes.
00:02:15
There's been the same since day one. We haven't changed it. With half of my face in my long hair and the glasses I haven't worn in a decade, we've left it like that. There was something about it. We got so committed to it. A lot of people change up. Change your picture, change the branding, but we just we just couldn't let it go. We didn't let it go. We just there was something about that turquoise man.
00:02:38
There was something about that color and the weird half a head that was taken from a painting that a guy named Nathan Smith did a long time ago. But it just stayed in. It stayed on. POW! Look out, I just shit my pants, just coffee acoa, there's an old timey plug, I guess I'm going back. I guess I'm stuck in a nostalgia mode. I have been actually I have been stuck. And I don't know if it's a nostalgia mode.
00:03:06
I don't know if it's a melancholy man. How about we just call it reflexion?
00:03:11
God knows we've got time to reflect and I've been a little surprised lately at my feelings about. My past me, it's a it's a little it's it's upsetting in a way, but today, a couple of things I want to tell you.
00:03:29
First, today, I will tell you that we have Zach Braff on the show. You know him from Scrubs and Garden State. He also hosts a podcast, Fake Doctors, Real Friends, with his Scrubs co-star, Donald Faison.
00:03:44
He's also in the upcoming movie The Comeback Trail with Robert De Niro, Tommy Lee Jones and Morgan Freeman. I don't know. I think they pushed that. So that'll be out when it's out.
00:03:58
Other thing I need to tell you is that if you're looking for those WTF mugs, it's holiday time and the hand thrown ceramic mugs that are generally only given to guests who come to my house and appear on the show.
00:04:13
There's a new batch coming up. They're made by Brian Jones and they're going to be available. These are the handmade mugs that I give my guests. So right now, getting these mugs from Brian Jones is the only way that you can get them. These are unique items. And a portion of the sales of these mugs go to the Connecticut Food Bank, just go to Brian R. Jones Dotcom. So I shop while they're still in stock. They go very quickly and they're beautiful.
00:04:43
All right. So there's that. I guess what I'm finding, and this is like and I'm meditating, folks. I'm in. I've been doing it now for a couple weeks. But I'm finding that the annoying thing that happens to me, and I don't know if this happens to you, is that, you know, when I think back on things, when even when I think back.
00:05:09
At like the beginnings of this show or things I did when I was younger, just getting to where I am just shows or or trying things or doing things is I'm amazed how fucking angry I can be myself for not knowing how to do something or for doing something in a way that I didn't think was great or I didn't think was good or I thought was embarrassing. I think my entire life. Has been a personal war against embarrassment. And nobody wins that nobody wins at war, but I think that there for some reason in my dumbhead, I've always and this is what I'm really thinking about when I'm taking apart my psychology, when I'm just breaking myself down.
00:05:57
It's just this idea of being embarrassed, of being laughed at, of being too weird. And ultimately, it comes down to being vulnerable, it comes down to, you know, being exposed, but I don't know when I really think about some of the risks I've taken in, some of the things I've done creatively and personally.
00:06:19
I'm very hard on myself, looking back like you idiot. That was fucking sad. That was ridiculous. Why'd you do that? I mean, like, you know better now or, you know, more now. You wouldn't do that today. Jesus Christ, that's fucking pathetic. That was embarrassing. That was, like, terrible. And I'm just surprised I do that, why can't I give myself a goddamn break, why can't I give myself a retroactive break?
00:06:49
Why can't I give myself a fucking pardon? You didn't commit no crime, dude. You were just bad at something. You just did something that was silly or you did something that made you feel to too vulnerable or too exposed or or you got left out for the wrong reason. This goes all the way back.
00:07:09
There are memories I have that are ridiculous, just ridiculous.
00:07:15
And like, I have a memory. Jesus Christ, this is a dumb ass memory. Oh, my God, I don't even know how old I was, but like I was in some sort of summer art class that my mother had signed us up for at the university a few hours a day. I don't know, I must have been, I don't know, 10. And I show up at this class maybe a little late and. You know, they're making tortillas.
00:07:49
That was the project. And all I could think was I you know, I just wanted to eat a tortilla, like I got there to make these hot tortillas and. You know, so I just grab one and eat it, but I didn't know that they were. Kind of making shapes with them or making things out of the tortillas, so I just fucking wolfed down this tortilla with this group of kids I didn't know. And a dumb art teacher.
00:08:14
A craft teacher. And, you know, they finish making them and I already ate one and the teacher just goes, hey, who ate the elephant? Who ate the elephant? And I didn't know that, you know, we were making out with the tortillas, I just wanted to eat a tortilla and I fucking hate the elephant. I ate it. Did I say that I I don't think I did, I just sat there like an idiot, No one.
00:08:43
I ate the elephant. And we see now I talk about that kid. Fucking I didn't know I walked into it, I was hungry, I was chubby, I just want to eat a fucking tortilla. Who ate the elephant? I guess I did, I guess I didn't know I didn't know we were making art. I just was hungry. I don't like the way my mom makes food. I ate the elephant, it was me. What are you going to do to me?
00:09:12
Are you going to shame me for being an elephant eater? Don't bother. I'm on it, I'm on it.

I have to assume that the reason I'm being so hard on myself retroactively, it's because I'm going to start shooting today on this movie and it's been a while since I've been on a set.
00:10:57
It's been a while since I've acted. I don't always feel like I can, but I went out there on Friday to their location to to get a covid test and to also, like, do this still photo for this set.
00:11:09
And I met my my daughter and my granddaughter, and it was great. It was kind of interesting, like that feeling of driving on to a set of, you know, getting ready to do the work.
00:11:20
That's why fucking I cannot stand people that condescend to the business of filmmaking or TV making or just sort of like you Hollywood types.
00:11:29
You actors like you get to a set, you drive up, you see the sign, the little coded sign pointing to where you go to base camp and there's a security guy there, tells you where to go.
00:11:41
And you just see the you see it all happening now and you see the trucks, you see people scrambling with lights. You see people you know, you see extras sitting six feet apart. Bover by catering, you just see the trailers.
00:11:52
You just see like this whole little universe of of work on all levels, you know, coming down from their director to the actor, the gaffer to the lights, the electricians to, you know, Pia's hair, makeup.
00:12:05
It's a little city of of employment and of creativity.
00:12:12
And it was kind of great driving on day one and realizing like this, I understand this. I haven't been on one of these in a while, but like somehow or another, I've done a lot of this in the last decade and and you just feel your body or my body. I felt my body just switching into like, all right, we're going to do the work.
00:12:33
We're going to make up we're going to tell a story, we're going to make a movie, I'm going to make a guy up that's probably kind of like me. And I don't know how that guy is going to interact with these other made up people, but that might be fun. So I'm trying to get it in my brain that it's going to be exciting and fun.
00:12:51
Maybe it will be. But God damn, I beat myself up and I just I'm trying to figure out how to stop that. I think that's been the journey. The one man's war against embarrassment, I mean, when you think about it. What is? The one thing you can do to try to fight embarrassment. Is get on stage and try to make people laugh, you're going to beat it out of you.
00:13:22
After a certain point, you know, you don't it doesn't matter if they're laughing with you were at you, you can probably control either of those after a certain point with a certain skill set, with a little craft.
00:13:36
My mother was one of the most embarrassing people I knew. She embarrassed me constantly and she made me feel like I was embarrassing. I'm not mad at her for it.
00:13:44
I guess it was a gift. If my mother didn't make me feel like a mediocre, chubby piece of shit. Through most of my life, and if she didn't do things in front of other people that made me embarrassed, I might not have the amazing career I have today in my war against embarrassment.
00:14:06
But I don't care anymore, see, I think that's also what's happening is that I've been doing a lot of the Instagram lives, which are kind of interesting because I speak freely and I also do things that I wouldn't do on a stand up stage or in front of people live necessarily even on television. I sing. I speak in a tone that's a little more candid. There's just something about engaging in that process that's kind of help me accept more of who I am.
00:14:35
And who I was and after coming out of those, that that makes me feel a little exposed, but I think it's going to help ultimately.
00:14:45
I think it's all about dragging that fucking chubby kid into the present and just making him sit uncomfortably with himself within me while we meditate.

So listen. Zach Braff, he's in a new movie, it's called The Comeback Trail, but Robert De Niro, Tommy Lee Jones, Morgan Freeman is set to come out sometime next year. So look for that. He hosts the podcast Fake Doctors, Real Friends with his scrub co-star, Donald Faison.
00:16:37
You can get that wherever you get podcasts. And I was I didn't know what to expect. I knew he was probably a good guy, but I was like, I want to meet him, though.
00:16:44
And he, you know, he wants to meet me. And, you know, we had great talk. Great guy. New Jersey. He actually talks like in New Jersey, in a New Jersey native with the real New Jersey accent, real New Jersey accent. And he reminded me some of my relatives. So this is me talking to Zach Braff. I pictured you in your garage. It looks like you got a fancy setup. This is a garage.
00:17:16
That's a fancy setup. I moved and the garage was sort of built into a room. And then I made it and I had to make it into a house. Kind of got it. So it's not really a studio. It's more of a house. And I've got sound panels up so the noise doesn't bounce around.
00:17:34
Hold on. Let me get the squeaky toy away from my puppet. No, I know how old that puppy.
00:17:42
I got a a 10 month old puppy that's just been spayed two days ago. So she's got a big foam thing around her neck and she's pissed off. And I have to constantly be apologizing to her.
00:17:53
You just got the puppy. Did you have a dog? Another dog?
00:17:55
I did. I just lost a dog. I had for 17 years a little guy named Roscoe. I had to put him down, which is the first time I've ever had to do anything like that. But it was clear that it was time he was blind and deaf and starting to have seizures.
00:18:12
I do that with a couple of cats in the last year to six year old cats. It's the worst.
00:18:18
It's really horrible. I mean, it's in the movies, but I'd never done the hold. The thing you love most in the world while they inject death medicine into it.
00:18:26
It's terrible, man.
00:18:28
Yeah, but but I was clear it had to be done. It was it wasn't one of those things. I was I was shocked. It was the day because I brought him in to be like, why is he having so many seizures?
00:18:37
And the vet, beautiful sweetheart of a guy said, you know, he said exactly what he needed to say. It was like, what? What what's your plan for this animal? This animals is is it's not really fair anymore.
00:18:50
Right.
00:18:50
And and and that kind of really hit I knew it was coming, but I didn't know it was that day, you know, and and so we just did it.
00:19:00
We we you know, we went in and said our goodbyes and then did it. Yeah.
00:19:05
I had the same experience, the first like I've been through a few cats, but these these last two, like, I just wanted to be there, you know, for it.
00:19:15
And like in both times I went to the vet thinking like, well, we'll see, but there's probably a good chance this is it. Like knowing in my guts, like even with the last guy monkey, you know, the vet was like, look, we could give him this and that. And, you know, he probably would have a little longer, but what are we doing?
00:19:33
Yeah, you know, you comes sometimes need in all aspects of your life, the person who goes, what are you doing in the vet says it.
00:19:41
It's like it's not in their best interest financially to tell you, you know what I mean?
00:19:47
So that's a good vet that says you sometimes need someone to push you over the edge and sort of see the thing you're not seeing. I mean, here's this seventeen year old animal who's blind and deaf and having seizures, you know, but you're, you know, holding on for me, not for the animal.
00:20:00
I know. And it's weird because, like, what do you like? I was sitting there going, what am I what am I holding out for? I mean, what what do I think's going to happen after a certain point? It's like they're not going to get better.
00:20:10
It's they were old, but, you know, wake up and be like, wait a minute, I'm fine.
00:20:17
But that's what you really what he did when he came when they brought him in, they went to they say he was really just on death's door and they said, OK, you say goodbye and we'll come in and give the medicine when you're when you're ready. So we were hugging him and we're kissing them and we go, OK, it's time they come in. The doctor comes in and he stands up and starts wagging his tail.
00:20:36
We're like, you, what are you doing, dude? You're not helping us at all.
00:20:39
No, exactly. But that but it gets to that point where it's like, well, they had a good day. They had a good hour. Look, he's walking like you used to, and that's what you're holding on to. And it's it's crazy.
00:20:51
It's a crazy lesson. Yeah.
00:20:53
I mean, but, you know, it's like I think you and I have had a lot of loss in this last year. Yeah. And it's like brutal.
00:21:03
It is.
00:21:04
It is. I've lost in the last couple of years. I lost my father, who was 84 and at least of old age. I lost my sister to an aneurysm and I just lost my friend to to covid.
00:21:18
So I've had a lot of death in my life. And during during during this insane pandemic time, it's it's been a real challenge for mental health.
00:21:27
I know. You know, like obviously I was following the stories about your friend Nick because it became sort of, you know, just the focus of what the disease was.
00:21:39
What could possibly happen was sort of hanging on, you know, the public case of his, you know, hospitalization and you showing up for him.
00:21:49
And and it's just, you know, in my my girlfriend died of you know, I knew I had met I had met Lynn.
00:21:56
I was like know I was lucky enough to have met her. And it's just like, you know, I don't want you know, I don't want us to both end up crying too much.
00:22:03
But but yeah. But it's very hard to sort of find your way through it. And you had his wife. And kid there, too, huh? Yes, so I won't we don't have to go down the whole rabbit hole, but just the cliff notes are that they had they were falling in love with L.A. They wanted to live in Laurel Canyon. Yeah. You know, he he loved rock and roll in the history of Laurel Canyon and Rock and roll.
00:22:23
And that was their dream, you know. How did you know him? We did a Broadway show together. We did a Woody Allen turn bullets over, bullets over Broadway, the movie into a musical, OK?
00:22:34
And everybody thought I was going to be enormous hit. And he was the Chazz Palminteri character and I was the John Cusack character. Right.
00:22:41
And it was the most fun I ever had in my life. Wasn't a huge critical success. It didn't last that long. But the friendships that I made there, one with him and then with the woman he fell in love with on the show, a dancer.
00:22:57
Right, Amanda? They they became my best friends and they decided to move out to L.A. And I have a guest house in my in my yard. So I said, guys, you know, don't pay me a dime, live here while you while you search live here for six, seven months while you figure out L.A.. Right. Because it's a win win. You guys get to live for free and look around and I get to have two of my best friends and their baby in my yard.
00:23:20
Right. And they were just, you know, adorable and happy and new baby and looking for houses. And just on cloud nine. And they found the house.
00:23:30
Yeah.
00:23:30
And and that he went home to pack and they both went home to pack and he must have contracted it while in New York.
00:23:37
Oh Jesus.
00:23:39
And he came back and had a very quick very quickly need to be hospitalized. So right after it all went down, I had them in my home.
00:23:47
So my girlfriend and I and friends in the neighborhood became the she never family here. Her family couldn't travel.
00:23:54
We became the support group, the community for her and everyone in the neighborhood and all of our friends just became her her her family until her family could actually come and help as well. Wow.
00:24:09
That's so heavy. And where she now she got home or she knows she she's staying in the house. You know, she she was, of course, debating, as anyone would do. I want to live in this house that we just bought. Right. But she's decided to stay and she loves it here. And she knows that Nick would want her to to be here. So she's she's staying. She's, you know, running, running her business to try and keep everything afloat.
00:24:32
And, of course, you know, I'm I'm here to help them if they need anything.
00:24:36
Well, that's good. Yeah. It's like this time is so brutal. And to be saddled with grief and the reflection that the time you have to sit in it is it's profound on one level.
00:24:49
And I think it's probably a very pure form of grief.
00:24:54
But on another level, it's just, you know, with the world weighing down on you on top of the grief, it's like now, holy shit.
00:25:00
And then and then I know about you, but I, I, I it's almost like cutting how much I read the news and the politics and, and watch everything.
00:25:09
And it's, it's, you know, one could choose I'm not that person to not engage so much in the political discourse, but that that almost is harder.
00:25:21
I can't turn my eye to it. So I feel like I'm torturing myself. No.
00:25:25
Yeah, it's just like crushing. It's like I can't breathe some days, dude, I can't breathe. It's like it's taking the wind out of me.
00:25:34
Yeah, I'm exhausted. I know. And it's fucked up.
00:25:38
It's so funny. I don't know what to do. I mean what do. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. What can you do with my my fucking read tweet on Twitter.
00:25:45
Mean anything. No I don't think it does. I'm just preaching to the choir and the people who fucking are magga and already hate me are just going to unfollow me or say something shitty. So I don't know, I think you're just screaming. I once got to sit with David Seimas who was who runs Obama's foundation. Yeah. And it's just one of the smartest men. I wish he'd run for president one day, but he said absolutely no fucking way.
00:26:08
But but he's just a genius. And he said, you know, this whole social media thing, it's you know, a lot of it, he said, is just screaming into your own echo chamber. No, it's it's sort of pointless.
00:26:20
It may it might rally it might rally a few people that may not have been rallied. But you're not changing anybody's minds. Yeah.
00:26:27
And most of the time, you're just making it worse. You're just giving yourself a reason to get more angry because I don't know how sensitive you are. But trolls are trolls and you are and how to to deal with it and shut it off and not engage. But it's like every time you put one of those things out in the world, you're like, oh, here it comes. Here comes something that's going to punch me.
00:26:47
Yeah, but I'll just do I'll try to I'll try to be above it. Right.
00:26:51
But that's impossible because they know how to hit you and they know how to get you engaged and they know how to get jobs.
00:26:56
How do they get you with what's your button.
00:26:59
Oh I don't know. They just, they'll say, you know, this is why don't watch your shitty movies or this is why, you know, this is why that movie you made is a piece of shit that. Riles me up because I know that's just an easy grab, but I, I, I don't know, I, I definitely can get riled. Oh yeah. By them. And the thing I don't do any more really is engage.
00:27:20
I don't I'll say what I say. People write what they write. If someone's horrible, I block them. But I don't. But I don't engage in a in a Twitter right now and I've grown out of that. Good.
00:27:29
Yeah. That's, I think that's the first step to getting off it altogether. I wish I had the fortitude.
00:27:34
Oh dude, I'm done. Breaks leg Just like alcohol. I mean, I don't know. I don't know if I'm sure if you're sober. Oh yeah. Sorry.
00:27:40
I knew that I go through alcohol breaks when I'm like, hey, you're drinking a little too much. And I and I want to prove to myself that I can like. Right. You know, obviously. So I take a break.
00:27:51
I'll take a break two, three months, whatever.
00:27:53
And I've done the same thing with Twitter because it's just as much of a fucking addiction as anything.
00:27:58
So you can like you can you can shut your page down for what you got two months before or you never shut it down.
00:28:05
No, I don't shut it down. As long as I don't turn the page off, I'll just I'll go through periods where, like, I went to do a movie with Christopher Walken up in the middle of nowhere in Canada.
00:28:15
When was this?
00:28:17
This was a year ago. And is it out? It's coming out.
00:28:20
It's out in Canada. And it's a tiny little indie. I'm sure it'll come out on streaming. It's called Pursey. It's a true story about the tiny bumble fuck farmer who took on Monsanto.
00:28:31
And did you direct it or just act it? I just acted and I play his lawyer. OK, so you're up there and he got off Twitter.
00:28:38
I was I went up there and I went, you know what? If I am on this bumble fuck like mess farm town and I'm drinking and I'm on Twitter and it's cold, I'm going to get depressed. I just knew the ingredients.
00:28:55
That's the cocktail for depression, that town drinking cold.
00:29:00
And I'm very affected by the weather. So if it's like cold and rainy and I'm drinking too much and I'm reading too much Twitter, I just it sounds like a horrible recipe. So I committed to myself. I was there for two weeks. Three weeks. Yeah, no no booze, no Twitter. And and I'm going to work out. And it made a big difference. I didn't get I didn't get melancholic.
00:29:22
Did you do the working out. Yeah. Working out is key for me in mental health. I in order to stay, keep my serotonin level above a above the right in the right green zone.
00:29:33
I need to work out. I've been doing it too. I mean I've been doing it more, more diligently. Now I can I'm old. I mean I'm not I'm fifty seven and I'm working out like circuit training three days a week and hiking two days a week. And I'm always fucking sore, but I don't know what it would be like if I didn't do that.
00:29:49
But I bet do do you know you feel much better when you're doing it. Yeah. It's a self-esteem thing. It's, it's a, it's a serotonin thing. It's a dopamine.
00:29:56
And you have serotonin problems. Yeah.
00:29:59
I have had throughout times in my life, like real depression, not only bed ridden but but but definitely I've been I've been on antidepressants at times in my life for feeling like but I have I have lots of psychologists in my family.
00:30:16
So none of that was ever frowned upon or know or looked down upon.
00:30:21
So, yeah, there's been times in my life I've had some some some periods of feeling really, really, really low and then sort of used used SSRI antidepressants to sort of get myself above water, almost like a crutch, and then get a little get to put a floor down.
00:30:39
Yeah, just just get out, get out of a hole. And, you know, sometimes it's triggered by a death or sometimes it's triggered by, you know, sometimes the scary ones are triggered by nothing.
00:30:51
Right. Or, you know, you can work on what is the source of this. But, you know, the probably the scariest one time I've been down is like my life is pretty amazing right now. What is going on, you know?
00:31:02
Yeah, it's fucked up. Brains are fucked. That's the scary. And it's so funny.
00:31:06
I talk to you and I like, you know, my family's from Jersey. I can hear Jersey, I can hear it. You have a real Jersey accent.
00:31:13
People say, I have a little one, but I don't have I don't think I have one.
00:31:16
It's certain words are stronger. And of course, when I talk to my family, it gets stronger. But, you know, words like coffee dog talk.
00:31:25
My sister used to be like, oh, my God, you guys, we got to get chocolate because I took the dog on a walk.
00:31:32
It's so specific. Yeah, it's very north jersey. Yeah.
00:31:36
It's really not New York. It's really its own thing. Which Jersey did you grow up in?
00:31:40
South Orange. Right. And it's right next to Newark, about 45 minutes from from Manhattan. Right.
00:31:46
I grew up, I'm from my family was in Jersey City. My father's family. Mother's family's in Morris County I think. Yeah. You know, Wayne, we're Wainer.
00:31:57
That's all around me. I you know, we grew up, you know, the commuter train was thirty minutes to Manhattan, so. Right. We we you know, we were we thought of ourselves as a suburb of Manhattan because we. Weren't really going to Newark for anything. Well, when you were growing up, Newark was not there was nothing there to go there for. There was nothing there to go to. And it was scary to us.
00:32:16
It was like, yeah, it was a tough city that we had heard about, but there was no reason to ever go there. Right. It was the opposite. It was the polar opposite of Manhattan.
00:32:25
Manhattan was like, oh, my God, we get to go to the big city all these years. Very exciting. Yeah. We're going to go see plays. We're going to go we're going to go to exciting things. We're going to we're going to go to an adventure where no one was ever like we're going to Newark on an adventure.
00:32:38
So how did you grow up? Because like I met, I didn't realize that that Jessica Kurson was your half sister.
00:32:46
She's my stepsister. Yeah. So my parents, my my my father married her mother when I was 13. And, you know, she was always the class clown of the family class clown.
00:33:01
Hilarious. And she wasn't she went to college, didn't she was going to be a social worker. And then but everyone she was so funny. Everyone kept saying, you got it, you should do standup.
00:33:10
And I've watched her career go from those things that we where you had to bring people and we had to buy. Yeah. For drinks and all that. Right. It would like to people in the audience to a billboard of her with her, with her time with in Times Square, with her special that Bellbird produced. I've watched that whole evolution happened for her. And there's nobody I know that that works harder.
00:33:31
Yeah. No, I love her. She's she's hilarious. She's a real character. Yeah. So so how many kids. So. OK, so your parents got divorced when you were like eleven or twelve.
00:33:41
My parents got divorced when I was eight or so. My, my and then my father started dating and it was very bizarre. We did joint custody. So my my mom moved in with a man she was seeing and she had a house.
00:33:57
And then my father moved in with with no one, but he got an apartment and we but he had fought hard for joint custody so and he won it. So we did a week and a week every Sunday night. There were four kids, oldest went off to college.
00:34:15
Second oldest was like, I'm sixteen. I'm not doing this bullshit. And but me and my sister would go every Sunday.
00:34:21
We'd switch homes. They were both in the same school district and we'd pack up all our shit and move every Sunday. It was hard.
00:34:30
Your dad had the sad divorce department and your mom had the house. Yes, my dad had the divorce apartment. And even more bizarre and I going to put this in a movie one day. So my dad was was dating and and had to, you know, was back out on the market and so needed pretty much. And it was and was a trial attorney very busy. So we needed a full time nanny. This Haitian woman named Jocelyn, who also had a young daughter, she must have been six.
00:34:58
And so in the apartment, we would they would sleep on the she and her daughter would sleep on the foldout couch in the living room.
00:35:05
My sister and I would share a bedroom and my father would be in the other bedroom sometimes with whatever woman he was.
00:35:14
He was hanging out with her, the real party. It was it was a packed apartment. And and and it was it was kind of insane.
00:35:22
But but that's so funny because he had the nanny, because he didn't want he didn't want to let you guys stay your mother more than she deserved. Right. Mind.
00:35:31
Right. Right. And then so he's out working and then dating and we're packed into this house. It was a very surreal time. I hated it really, because every Sunday I would we would pretty much cry because we'd gotten attached to that parent. Right. And then you'd move and then you'd be grumpy and melancholic. And then about Wednesday you'd be settled.
00:35:55
Right. I really think it's a source of anxiety for for me as an adult still, because it was, you know, without like clockwork on Sunday, something traumatic was going to happen.
00:36:09
Right. You knew it. Yeah. Separation anxiety.
00:36:11
Yeah. Because you do you do bond with that parent. And they had very different lifestyles. My mom was was living with this man who she still married to was a psychologist. And they were they were homebodies and they were sort of, you know, hippie hippies a bit. And my dad was like, you know, we're going out.
00:36:27
We're going we're going to a restaurant with this new flight attendant I met. And this is Cheryl.
00:36:36
Your dad was the traditional midlife crisis guy. Oh, yeah.
00:36:40
I mean, he was a master at seducing flight attendants. Wow. I remember there were always like uniforms hung on the on the back of his bedroom door of, like, the woman he'd met on on on the plane that trip and just the sort of like fucked up boundaries of that.
00:36:56
Do you know what I mean?
00:36:57
Like now like I've in my life, I've dated a woman with a kid and it's sort of like, you know, I don't want to meet the kid for six months, you know, like, you know what I mean? It's like it's not fair.
00:37:07
Yeah. You know, if you're going to build a relationship with somebody because then like God, what if he had gotten attached to one of them and then we did, there was plenty of time. We did get attached to them and then they go away. And then he decided it was over and then you'd be, you know, that's more anxiety.
00:37:21
There were definitely ones we liked more than others. And then eventually the good news is eventually he found the woman who my dad needed therapy and goes without saying. At this point, he eventually started dating a therapist who was incredible. And we kids loved her because not only was she so fun and beautiful and amazing, but she was also saying, listen, if you want this to be real, you got to start doing some work on yourself, because, you know, I'm not going to I'm not going to commit to to you being the way you are now.
00:37:52
So she started and he was he was starting to fall in love. And this was the one. And he was with her. He was with her till the day he died because that's how he putting it all together. Jessica's mother. Right. So she kind of like was like we it's like the six million dollar man. Like we have the technology. We will rebuild him. Yeah. And and she turned him into a much more mentally healthy man.
00:38:16
They both ended up with therapists. Oh, you're saying my mom is a psychologist. My stepfather's a psychologist. My step mother is a therapist. My father was a lawyer who thought he was like a marriage counselor. We were surrounded by all four of them analyzing and weighing in on everything.
00:38:33
And there was like four kids that you have three brothers and sisters. And then there was how many step brothers and sisters.
00:38:40
So I had I had in the original plan, there were two brothers and an adopted sister. Yeah. She has since passed.
00:38:49
When they got remarried on my dad's side, I gained two stepsisters, including Jessica Kherson, and then on my mom's side, I gained a stepmother. So there were there were seven of us total.
00:39:00
And was this a Jewish undertaking?
00:39:02
Yes, very Jewish. The Jew was strong.
00:39:07
I really have strong like I mean, like when we grew up before they got divorced, I grew up kosher concerns. Come on. Oh, yeah. Here's an interesting thing. My dad was religious and felt my mom was not Jewish. And he said, look, I'm in love with you, but I can't marry a non Jew. Will you have an Orthodox conversion? Like and that means like I no fucking around, like, real converts. Yeah, not like here, sign here.
00:39:32
Now you're Jewish like shit to go do the work and study once a week classes, all this stuff.
00:39:38
But my mom was in love and she didn't have any connection to to Protestantism. Yeah. So she did it and then, and then I think this happens with a lot of people who find a religion later in life.
00:39:49
They're like she was like I'm all in. And then she ended up making him more Jewish.
00:39:55
He wasn't kosher originally. She was like a lot. Yeah. She was like, this is amazing. But let's if we're going to do it, let's do it. And so they became kosher. They he became president of the temple. They they got very, very into it. Wow. And their whole community. Their whole community was the temple.
00:40:10
That happens a lot, though, with converts. They make they become more Jewish. Yeah. Because like usually Jews, white middle class American Jews like I'm a Jew. Could you be a Jew? But they're not really. Yeah, they just grew up Jewish.
00:40:23
Yeah, that's that's funny. I think a lot of people I, I had a bar mitzvah. My parents know we worked for me too for a time, but then we weren't, we weren't going to temple regularly when I once I was you know, we're not my father. We get very religious around the high holy days. You know, that's when he really wanted to flex his his Jewishness. Yeah.
00:40:41
You know, you didn't and you didn't stick with it. Really, I did. No, not at all. I mean, I relate to the the I love the food. I love the comedy. I love culture. Yeah. The traditions, the culture of it all.
00:40:53
The inside jokes about Woody Allen, even though, you know, I know we're not allowed to talk about Woody Allen anymore, but I was raised on Woody Allen. I was raised on Mel Brooks. I was raised on on on Jewish humor that I love.
00:41:05
But but the spiritual element, like, you know, for me. When it comes down to, you know, what about that God, you know, and what about the context of the Jewish God? Like I don't I to be honest with you, I don't know enough about it. And I never followed any of the rules. I never understood the prayers, you know, even on my half Torah and all the I don't know any of it in English.
00:41:27
So I don't I never was I never had that relationship. It seems like people who grow up with Jesus, it's pretty simple to understand the Jewish God.
00:41:35
On the other hand, they have their bullet points down better. Yeah, yeah, it's true.
00:41:41
And the iconography, the iconography is clear, you know, very clear and very practical to that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. R is like I'm not sure, you know, what our relationship is or we better branding.
00:41:52
We need better branding or marketing. Yeah. That's for sure. It's a little vague. I act like we like I'm trying to recruit, I mean like it is a little vague.
00:42:00
It's you know, but you know, I didn't know I grew up in North Jersey where there were a lot of Jews.
00:42:06
I went to then spend time in Manhattan, then went to school outside Chicago, then moved to L.A.. I've always been in communities that had a lot of Jews. I was shocked when I learned we were like two percent of the population and shrinking because I was always in communities with lots of Jews.
00:42:21
Yeah, that our generation is fucking it up. Your generation, my generation, the one after they they want nothing to do with it. It's not that important to him. Yeah. They don't even know what the food is anymore. They don't have that grandparent that's first generation anymore. Right.
00:42:36
That's true. I believe that.
00:42:37
So now when you with all this chaos outside of anxiety, did did you find that you had other psychological problems with all this, like all these psychologists in the world, in your family?
00:42:48
I think I was depressed. I had some OCD. I was definitely doing the some of the tap tapping stuff that OCD kids. Really? Oh, yeah.
00:42:56
So it's a control thing. Like, you know, everything's it's a little chaotic.
00:43:00
You got to this is what I remember as a child. And I'm sure there's people listening who either are still doing this or did this. But I remember thinking I need to kiss that teddy bear goodbye six times.
00:43:14
If I don't do it, I'm not positive something bad will happen. But it might. So just to cover my bases and be safe, I'm going to kiss the teddy bear six times.
00:43:25
And the weird thing about that type of thinking is like that you decided that the teddy bear kissing was the thing that well, that's an example.
00:43:35
It could be there was a myriad of things, but I'm saying that was what I remember. No, I get it. I get it. But it's curious what those choices are to to guarantee your safety for the rest of the day.
00:43:43
Right. But I convinced myself as a child that even as a child I knew. This is ridiculous, Zach.
00:43:48
But just to be safe, why not? It just kind of it's actually kind of like praying for people. It's like I don't know if I necessarily believe in this, but just to cover my bases, I'm going to pray to God.
00:43:59
Now, I did a joke about that, about OCD requires its ritual and and there's ritual to it that you find comfort in.
00:44:07
So it's not you know, I think that some religion, especially the more complicated ones, are organized OCD around. You know, that ritual element is comfort, comfort.
00:44:16
I've covered my bases. It's funny, though, I guess in the OCD realm, you you yourself, in your own soul are making up what the tenets of the religion are.
00:44:26
Do you do like that? Like, I used to do a bit about the positive side of OCD is that, you know, every time you go back to check to see if you turn the gas off, you know, every time that it's off, you get that same bit of relief that.
00:44:38
Yeah, so like, yeah, that's not nothing.
00:44:41
Yeah. It's like a dopamine hit. Right. So yeah, I did some of that stuff and I grew out of that and I but it's funny, I remember a psycho psychiatrist when I was a child telling my parents, you know this, he'll grow out of some of this, but some of this will be will he'll be dealing with his whole life.
00:45:02
And what was it I just think is a form of anxiety. And I mean, every every human being has anxiety. I'm not I don't see that I'm normal anxiety. I just mean, I think the OCD, I'm not tapping Teddybears bears any more, tapping anything anymore.
00:45:15
But I think that the roots of it, which are some, you know, anxiety based, are still aspects of my life.
00:45:21
Yeah, I think I have. And I've talked about it a million times. Like, I realize that I'm not really a depressive as much as I am as anxiety person. Yeah, I give a lot of dread, you know.
00:45:33
Do you sorry if you've spoken about this, but do you meditate? I don't.
00:45:38
And I've been told to Linnaeus' too. She was TRM person twice a day or if not more. And I you know, I'm a sober guy and I know meditation is all part of it.
00:45:46
I just don't I don't know what it is, Zach, about my brain. It's like I know that would probably be good. Why not just try that you're exercising. You're doing all this other stuff. Why are you holding out?
00:45:56
You know what the thing is about when you reach our age. I'm I'm forty five. Right.
00:46:01
And I think you you you you know the things that are going to help or hurt you. Right. Sobriety has really. To exercise has really helped you, right? I have my things, and it's like I could lay out in fact, I've done this. I had a friend who was having like a breakdown and I said, all right, I'm going to write you a menu of what you need to do if you do this.
00:46:21
I guarantee you, I'm not a psychologist, but I've been to plenty of therapy. If you do this menu, you're going to take some leaps forward. Obviously, go see someone professional.
00:46:31
But here's a start. But were they exercise diet? I mean, in broad strokes, stop drinking. Stop smoking. We exercise every single day. You meditate twice a day. You're journaling, writing everything down that you're stressed about being in conversation with with loved ones. There were a few others eating. Eating, right. You did every single one. And then, of course, started seeing someone professional. And now he's now he's found true love and he's married and never been happier.
00:47:05
I'm not saying I saved his life. I'm just saying I was I was a crisis counselor for a second. That's all I'm saying.
00:47:10
It's a big list. It's a lot to do.
00:47:12
No, but when I'm one of my point is to you is that I was thinking that, you know, you and I have reached a point where we know what works for us.
00:47:20
And then, of course, there are things on top of that. They're like the bonus things for me, it's meditate. I know if I haven't done time yet, but I just use one of the apps. I know if I do that twenty minutes every morning, five days a week, my anxiety is going to be noticeably less. Really. Can I always do that? Do I sometimes go off Phuket? Of course. But but I can't.
00:47:42
But then if I'm anxious, I have to call myself out and go do did you fucking exercise, did you drink too much? Did you meditate? Did you do the things on the checklist? Because then you have to take 100 percent responsibility for your own mental health.
00:47:56
Yeah, and I've been and I've been Jiachen myself on coffee again. I didn't drink. That's another year. That's another one. Oh that was another one on the list. No coffee, no caffeine.
00:48:04
As I as I sit here drinking a Red Bull, by the way, I got into active brain so it's like I just do it all day until I'm exhausted. Can you sleep. Yeah, I sleep. All right.
00:48:12
Yeah. Well I think if you've given up booze, in my humble opinion, you should allow yourself some caffeine. No, I'm good.
00:48:19
So when did you start the performing business? My dad did community theater right around. My God. Jewish community theater. Oh yeah.
00:48:29
Very Jewish community theater. And he was good because he was a trial attorney. So he knew how to he knew how to entertain a roomful.
00:48:35
Did he play a Tavia pretty close.
00:48:37
He did. He did. Prisoner of Second Avenue in the Neil Simon play.
00:48:42
And then he did. He did.
00:48:45
Hello Dolly. He was Horace Van Gelder. Wow. And you know, he was good. We get the leads because he was he was charming. And and so I was a little kid and I'd go watch him do the plays and be like, this is this is a job. So you're saying some people don't just do this as their hobby?
00:49:01
This is a job you can have because I just thought it was the most I was watching my dad make a five hundred people laugh. And I was like, that's the coolest thing I've ever seen. How do I get into this?
00:49:12
Yeah, and I had no interest in sports at all. Couldn't be less interested. Yeah. And so when it came to camp, which is very big on the East Coast, especially for Jews, they were like, you know, there are camps that aren't sports related, Zack.
00:49:24
There are theater camps where you go and like you perform and you take classes. And I was in the tech theater too, like lighting and stage set going. And he was like, you do all that. You build sets and you you you do anything. Stage combat. This is right. When video cameras were starting to become popular, like they even have video courses.
00:49:40
And so I, I went there to a place called Stagedoor Manor in upstate New York. And I just was it was Utopia. I had never been so happy in my whole life.
00:49:52
It was a summer camp. It was a summer camp where you'd go for three week intervals. I went for six weeks. Every three weeks you would do you'd be put in a show. Every kid was put in a show. Yeah.
00:50:02
And you rehearsed the show and also take classes and also fall in love for the first time and also be up in the woods. And then. And then. And then you'd start again the next three week session and your parents would come up at the end of each of the three weeks and see the plays.
00:50:16
Yeah, I went to camp every year, like I always wondered whether it was my parents wanted me. They have new experiences or just wanted me out of the house.
00:50:25
It was never both. Why can't it be both? It can be both.
00:50:29
I went to an arts and music camp in Pennsylvania. That was the best one. What was it called? Lighthouse.
00:50:34
OK, because there was another one called French Woods that was very popular too.
00:50:38
This was in like Potsdam, Pottsville. It was in Pennsylvania and it was mostly music. And it was not there wasn't theater. It was all music and painting and photography and ceramics, but no theater that I can remember. Right.
00:50:53
Well, mine was very musical theater, Broadway kind of show based. I mean, they did have non musicals as well.
00:51:00
How many years did you go? I went I went to I went to two different camps. I went for a total of four summers. But the one that I'm. Mentioning because it was the most impactful I went to for two years and while I was there and it was just it was Utopia because in public school, not playing sports, I had friends because I was a class clown and and funny, I think. But I but but I couldn't get the girls because they weren't that interested in me.
00:51:26
And and this is right when puberty is really kind of kicking in and there I go to camp and I'm like, good. So I'm getting the leads. And I and and keep in mind, half the boys, they're already realizing they're gay.
00:51:38
So it was like it was I was like, oh, all the girls, like, you know, I was dating, like the popular girl and I'm the lead in the play. I was like I was the quarterback of the football team there.
00:51:49
Right. And I never want to leave.
00:51:51
I would sob when it was time to leave.
00:51:53
So one, because it was so close to Manhattan, two hours away, scouts would come up and and look at the kids and see. Really? Yeah.
00:52:02
Were there were there were there like a lot of like good actors there. Well, yeah.
00:52:07
Plenty of other known actors besides me. I've gone there. Robert Downey Jr. went there. Natalie Portman, Josh Charles, Mandy Moore, Jon Cryer. A lot of, a lot of.
00:52:18
So this was a high level. This was a known but it's it's still to this day the most known if you're if you're going to send your kid due to a program in the summer.
00:52:26
Yeah. Oh, OK. All right. So the scouts come the scouts come up and they see like, hey, is there any talent for me to recruit, to send on auditions in Manhattan? And I got scouted and a manager started submitting me for auditions in the city.
00:52:41
My parents bring me thirteen. Do you remember your first girlfriend's name? The first girl at camp Lacey Tucker? I was I was just smitten and she was my first French kiss. And I didn't I didn't really know what was happening. I knew that I knew that there was going to be tongue involved, but I didn't really know what to do. And she kind of took the lead. Yeah.
00:53:00
And there it was and was glorious. Yeah.
00:53:05
The innocence of that first French kiss.
00:53:06
And I remember the bench, you know, because I've gone up since to my nieces and nephews. Go to the camp now and I've gone up and seen the bench.
00:53:14
It's just like, oh, where you had the French kiss. Yeah. Where the French kiss went down. So they do anything.
00:53:20
Does it do anything. The business dialogic kick in. Yeah.
00:53:24
Yeah, definitely. I'm very emotional when I'm there because it was such a it was such a it was heaven to me. That place I was, it was an escape from the family drama I told you about. It was escape from anxiety, was escape from feeling else. I just didn't feel like I fit in at all at public school. And then when I was there, it was magical.
00:53:45
And then, of course, I'm like you said, I'm leaving out. I'm burying the lead. I was performing and getting laughs and and going. This is just so intoxicating. I'm in.
00:53:55
And when the manager took you on, what were you going out for? Did you get anything?
00:53:59
Oh, I mean, went out for, like, a lot of famous movies like callbacks on like big and and parenthood.
00:54:08
Wow. I met I remember reading meeting Ron Howard for Parenthood because I got a number of callbacks. I met Oliver Stone, four born on the Fourth of July. Lots of things like this. I got to I actually got a film called The Good Son and which was going to change my life because it was a lead in the movie. And then the movie got shelved. They later made it with Elijah Wood and Macaulay Culkin, I believe.
00:54:33
Right.
00:54:34
So a lot of things were happening. And then I got a pilot for CBS, Bruce Paltrow, who had created St. elsewhere, made a pilot called High, which is supposed to be like is big new show about.
00:54:46
Oh, yeah, yeah. And it was going to be gritty. It was the same year, nine or two unknown came out. And Bruce Paltos answer to that was, no, we're going to do the opposite of the glossy soap opera version. We're going to do a gritty like Hill Street Blues, but a high school and Jersey version. And it was Gwyneth Paltrow first job she has. She was his daughter and she was the beautiful cheerleader. And I was the sort of nerdy freshman.
00:55:09
And and we shot it in Jersey. And I couldn't believe it. I thought my life was going to change. And then they didn't pick it up.
00:55:17
And I was like, wait a minute, I'm picking it up. I have a gift that I have a gift basket. And it says, I have a card that says, welcome to the CBS family.
00:55:24
I didn't know that pilots didn't get picked up. I thought I thought, oh, wow.
00:55:27
So that's why you had to learn. Like, that's like you had to learn that I learned that at fourteen because, like, they they almost always never get picked up.
00:55:37
Yeah, I didn't. I didn't. I remember. Not understand. Would you how would you know.
00:55:41
I didn't understand and I was so high profile it was like a big budget thing and this was a famous show runner and I was like, yeah, I don't get it.
00:55:47
Yeah. How is this possible? But I think it was such a blessing in disguise because I, I, I would not have have accomplished the things I've accomplished. I don't think had I been like a full fledged successful child actor.
00:56:00
No, probably not. I mean, so what what happened after that.
00:56:05
I kept auditioning for a bunch of things and then. I didn't really get much kind of checked out a little bit, you know, it was tough because I was a teenager and then it took it would take me an hour to get in. I'd go sit in a waiting room sometimes and go in like, thank you. And then it took an hour to get home. All my friends are hanging out and swimming in pools and and pulling bong hits and hooking up with each other.
00:56:27
I was on a New Jersey transit train going in for a 30 second audition, so I started to get a little demoralized by it.
00:56:33
Then when I was 18, Woody Allen cast me in Manhattan murder mystery. I am in one scene in the film, but I play his and Diane Keaton's son.
00:56:44
And and that was like, oh, shit, maybe I should be paying attention to this because I just got a small part, but I just got a part in a very high profile thing.
00:56:55
But I had gotten into Northwestern Film School, so I had to choose, OK, fork in the road. Are you going to stay in Manhattan and ride this? You just got a partner Woody Allen movie, or are you going to say fuck it and go off and study? What I really wanted to do was study filmmaking and acting at Northwestern. And so that's what I did. So you went there all four years?
00:57:13
I went there for years, yeah. Studied filmmaking, made short films, just did everything and anything. Pretty much there wasn't, um, filmmaking or acting related.
00:57:23
I was mildly interested and I mean, it was a liberal arts education.
00:57:26
So I studied lots of things I had to but and of course made amazing friendships and and I had had my first true love and all those wonderful college things.
00:57:37
But but really, you know, focused on filmmaking and making movies.
00:57:42
That's what you wanted to do. Yeah.
00:57:44
I think I kind of got clear, like I had seen because I'd had this experience, I'd seen so many actors that were good that were barely surviving.
00:57:51
Sure, I had a I had an education because of my exposure that showed me this is so such a fucking lottery.
00:58:00
I mean, I'm I'm sitting next to these actors who were chain smoking. They need this pilot because they got to pay their mortgage.
00:58:05
Yeah. And I and I it scared me in a very young age. It scared me. And I said, I love to act and I want to act. But that's such a fucking lottery. I'm not investing in that.
00:58:14
I'm going to invest in making my own stuff real.
00:58:18
You had that realization. At what age? In my teens, really, you were able to see. Oh, yeah, man, because I would go do play readings. You know, you do play readings for anyone listening who doesn't know, you know, they're trying to see if they're going to do this play. They don't pay you anything. You just go read the play. I would go do that. And as it like let's say I was 15 years old and I'd sit across from an actor who was giving the performance in this play like I had never fucking seen another actor given my life and you never seen them and you never knew who they were and they had no money.
00:58:50
And that scared the shit out of me. I was like, this isn't a meritocracy. Yeah. I mean, I always say, obviously, if you're a genius, you've bought a lot of lottery tickets.
00:59:02
And if you happen to be also good looking, you've bought even more lottery tickets.
00:59:06
But it's still a fucking lottery. And I didn't want to be reliant on that.
00:59:09
No makes sense. But it's good that you had that realization young.
00:59:13
Right? So I knew if I if I got the education in filmmaking and producing and making stuff, I'll always find out if my number doesn't come up as an actor, I'll produce movies, I'll make movies, I'll be a cinematographer.
00:59:24
I'll be a first aid. I will work in my my backup won't be being an orthodontist. I knew that I was going to somehow be in production. Right.
00:59:33
And then but like when this how to scrubs happen, that changes fucking everything. Right. Yeah.
00:59:38
Well that's a bit of a jump. I went I went back to Manhattan after school and started peeing on on you.
00:59:46
You made the movie before that, huh?
00:59:48
No, no, no. First I. I went to Manhattan and started doing what a lot of kids do out of film school. I was peeing and this is the height of video music videos. So was like this is like ninety seven people are making like seven million dollar music videos. Right. And a lot of them are shooting in Manhattan. And I worked on a lot of those and that kind of was a continuing education. I got to see production firsthand and be a grunt.
01:00:12
Right. I kept auditioning. Not much happening. And then my very first job I get as an actor is in the public theater in Manhattan's production of Macbeth with Angela Bassett, Alec Baldwin, Liev Schreiber, Michael C. Hall. That's crazy. Yeah.
01:00:31
George Seawolf directing huge theater director. I've interviewed him. Oh, yeah. Of course he's a legend. And so that was my first job. And I had really gotten a lot out of Shakespeare in college. I had a professor that really opened my eyes to Shakespeare. So I, I was I had a great audition for George, and my first job was playing the two young characters in Macbeth.
01:00:53
And I had a giant broadsword duel with Alec Baldwin and it was thrilling.
01:00:58
What was your experience that day? How old were you? Twenty. I must have been right out of college. Twenty one. Twenty one. And you're dealing with Alec and you're dealing with these huge actors. What you know, was it overwhelming?
01:01:09
Do Alec was scary. Alex a scary fucking dude. Yeah. He was always nice to me, but he was very intimidating. Right.
01:01:17
But I needed to be to be operating at that level. At that age. You're really in it at that point. You must have thought like, well, acting's pretty good.
01:01:26
I yeah. First of all, I'd never been paid. I mean, I've been paid a little bit for the kid things I'd done, but this was like I was fresh out of college and doing pay rate, which was like one hundred bucks a day. Yeah. So all of a sudden, even though it was theater, it was equity, it was like a weekly check. I was my self-esteem shot up because I was like, not only am I in a play, but I'm getting a regular check for acting.
01:01:47
This is cool. Yeah. And you know, Liev Schreiber is inarguably, I think, the best Shakespearean American Shakespearean actor. Alec was great, don't get me wrong. But I think even he would say watching live play Banquo in the show was like grad school. Yeah.
01:02:06
Because he's just a phenomenal, phenomenal Shakespearean actor. That was one of the coolest things I took from it. Just getting to watch. I learned so much from watching him and Michael C. Hall, obviously. Then I start to get a little traction.
01:02:17
I started I did a little indie called Getting to Know You.
01:02:21
Then I did a film called The Broken Hearts Club. Greg Berlanti, his first feature film, uh, was about a bunch of gay friends living in West Hollywood.
01:02:32
And I by this point, I'd moved I'd followed a girl out to L.A., which was a debacle.
01:02:38
And I was waiting tables at a French Vietnamese restaurant called Look Colonial. I remember that place. Yes. It's now, if, you know, with a like of Beverly Hills.
01:02:46
Right. It's over. You know, where there's a giant like a store. That's Beverly and Roberts.
01:02:51
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That used to be it. Yeah I remember. Yeah.
01:02:55
And I wear a beige tunic and and I was waiting tables there and I was in Broken Hearts Club which was out at the Sunset five.
01:03:04
And people who had moved out here, I had moved out here, I followed the girl out here. But in my mind it was kind of like even doesn't work out with the girl. I'm starting to get momentum. I got to inches under my belt, like, I got to start making some moves.
01:03:18
But I got out here and was broke. So waiting tables like. All broke actors do and but my film, the indie broke in high school was at the Sunset five and people would come from the movie theater, having seen the film to the restaurant for drinks or dessert.
01:03:33
And they do a double take and they say, we we just saw your movie.
01:03:37
And I said, oh, thank you. And they say, you were great. And I said, well, thank you.
01:03:41
Let me let me tell you about our specials we have.
01:03:44
And it was so it was so incredibly humbling. Yeah. And I always say, you know, only in Hollywood can you go see a film and then have the star of the film wait on you for dessert. Sure.
01:03:54
And it was in this time where I where I first auditioned for Scrubs and and that that, of course, changed my life.
01:04:03
I didn't make Garden State my first feature until until I think the second hiatus from from Scrubs.
01:04:12
Yeah. You're in. It's so funny that the that whole waiter story there's a guy, a comic named Mark Cohen used to do a joke about living in Hollywood and his parents came out to visit him. They'd be out to dinner.
01:04:24
And his mom would say, like, I think that I think that waiter is Potsie from Happy Days and might and goes, no, that can't be. Oh, my God, it is.
01:04:32
But that's true.
01:04:34
I mean, I, I would have the most humiliating things, Mark, where I would like go on a meeting and a general meeting where I'm just talking to a producer and I'm blowing myself up because I'm talking to all the great things that are going on.
01:04:48
And yet I can't believe it. It's so exciting. You're just fucking doing a dog and pony show. And then I'd go to work and I'd look and I'm like, I just sat table 25 and it'd be him and his friends like, fuck.
01:05:01
And and then it's awkward. He doesn't want to address it, so he gives a little smile.
01:05:07
But I'm like pouring wine for him and his friends after two hours earlier doing in general about how great my life is worth.
01:05:15
And it's like, but you got you know, you made it like the story has a happy ending. I'm right.
01:05:22
And I had a fucking meeting with somebody. I don't know if it wasn't the Four Seasons, it was another hotel. And this is like, you know, like maybe ten years ago or less.
01:05:33
And fucking Sebastian Maniscalco is waiting tables over there.
01:05:38
And I and then I knew he was a comic, but I didn't know he had that day gig. And now he's like one of the biggest comics in the world. So sometimes it ends OK.
01:05:45
Yeah, there's plenty of happy endings. But I remember that moment of seeing him and knowing that, yeah, this is just fucking hell.
01:05:52
I know so many.
01:05:52
You know, listen, there's plenty of people who don't have a happy ending to that to that tale. And I'm very aware of how how lucky I am that I that I. Yeah, it's not for the faint of heart. This is hard business.
01:06:05
Yeah. So all right. So but scrubs turns everything around to hit show and you do it forever. But but but mostly if if what you're saying is true and I'm not doubting you, that it gave you the wherewithal and the momentum to make a movie which is. Yeah.
01:06:20
So the first thing that because of because of my hustler I'm going to fucking make it or die trying mentality. I went, oh my God, this show is going to be my ticket to having people take my my screenplay seriously. So I had, I had I had the screenplay in pieces, but I put it all together.
01:06:41
I really I really I really sat down once I got scrubs and took it seriously and said, you're a fucking idiot if you don't have a screenplay because this is come on, this is momentum.
01:06:49
I didn't know Long Scrubs is going to go on forever, didn't it? Well, I did nine years.
01:06:54
Yeah. But I mean, I don't. But who the hell ever thinks that's going to happen? I mean, that's right. It was unrealistic.
01:07:00
I thought it could go to I got to ride the wave. So then my my first hiatus I did, I did Shakespeare in the Park in New York, a production of Twelfth Night.
01:07:08
And then whilst I was there, I wrote Natalie Portman a letter because I knew that she had done the Delacorte Theater.
01:07:19
She'd done a production of The Seagull. And I thought, God, Natalie is my perfect person for this film. I'm going to use this angle of we've both been in this worked in this theater. I wrote this very personal note, sent the script. She loved it. We met for coffee and then she said yes, which meant my second hiatus. We were off to the races making making the movie.
01:07:39
That's and and there's some other people that went on to pretty big careers in the movie, too. Yeah.
01:07:43
Peter Sarsgaard and Ian Holm, we just passed away. I know Ian was the best wonderful man. Oh, my God. I bet I just watched him. I just watched the sweet hereafter again.
01:07:55
That's how I discovered him. Yeah. I mean, I know that's how I he became known to me.
01:07:59
That movie is insane. So dark.
01:08:02
Do you like Taraji like that. I really love a good tragedy. Well, yeah.
01:08:07
I mean it's like I don't know how I saw it. I just thought that there. How do they get that. They have one.
01:08:13
They must add one take on that school bus shot. How many times could they.
01:08:17
Sometimes, sometimes you just got to roll five cameras on it and hope something. Good happens. I mean, they couldn't rebuild, they couldn't get the ice back over that lake, there's no fucking way, man. So I guess like Buster Keaton in the general, they're only blowing that bridge once.
01:08:32
But I love I I'm really you know, it's funny.
01:08:35
People think of me, I think a lot of for for for for comedy because of Scrubs or romantic comedy because of Garden State.
01:08:43
But I'm very often drawn to to writing and appreciating darker fare. The thing I'm writing now is, is a pretty dark tragedy really.
01:08:54
Maybe, but maybe it's because of all the I mean, lot maybe of living what's what's coming out of me.
01:08:59
You know, I, I think that it's what I once had an amazing singer write a song for my film, and it wasn't exactly right.
01:09:11
And I tried to give him some notes and he said, Zach, you got to be honest with you was just in this day and age, in this moment after watching your film, that's what came out of me.
01:09:18
And I've been feeling that with this thing I've been writing is that it's kind of what came out of me during this during this period.
01:09:26
Well, it's good that you're being you're able to generate at all.
01:09:29
I'm trying. I'm trying. It takes. It takes. It takes work. Getting my ass. It kicks ass. It takes working ass, getting my ass in the chair.
01:09:36
I mean, I've talked to other writers who, you know, I have one friend who's a big shot and it's like it's he's having a hard time.
01:09:44
I mean, it's hard to it's hard to reflect because we're almost we're still in the trauma.
01:09:48
Right. Right. But for me. For me, I feel like I got to I have I got to do it because I don't I can't allow myself the distraction of not working on it, because there's just so much time for me to be sitting here and staring at the cursor, beat yourself up.
01:10:06
I do. I'm very hard on myself. Yeah.
01:10:08
Because I want to I don't want to for this to I am a writer, but it's hard for me to write.
01:10:13
I find it to be the hardest of the of the things I hate it. Yeah. It's very hard. Lawrence Lawrence Lawrence Kasdan apparently once said being a writer is signing up to have homework for the rest of your life. And that's how I feel about it. Yeah, I was like, I always work.
01:10:29
But you brought the Garden State together. You pull that you found your your backers in the movie did well.
01:10:35
It was a personal movie, you know, like it was great.
01:10:38
And that way, I mean, I remember the soundtrack was huge.
01:10:41
Yeah. I won a Grammy. Yeah, it's great.
01:10:46
And then you just kept going with that TV show. Did they did that get to a point where you'd had enough of that?
01:10:50
Yeah. Yeah, I loved it. Right. I mean, in fact I loved it. And Donald Faison, who was my co-star and we actually were doing a podcast now called Fake Doctors, Real Friends, because I saw him in a movie.
01:11:04
Remember, the Titans are clueless.
01:11:06
No new movie with I don't think it's out yet with Dorff. Oh yeah. Yeah. He's got a new film with Stephen Dorff coming out.
01:11:13
I just watch a dwarf sent it to me. It's called The Embattled. I think it was a good place. Yeah, I liked it. He plays a vet. Yeah, he's amazing.
01:11:22
He's my best friend in the world. And so we we kind of like during the during quarantine and everything said, well, we we have a lot of free time on our hands. Let's go back and watch the episodes and talk about them and joke about them and kind of tell old stories. So we've been we've been doing that. It's reminding me of how much fun it was and and all and all the nostalgia. But of course, after nine years, I was definitely over it because I just felt like I started to see us all recycling jokes and leaning into jokes.
01:11:53
And and it's hard because the money is ridiculously intoxicating.
01:11:57
But I felt like I want to do other things.
01:12:00
But you did do another movie and you did other things.
01:12:03
Yeah, I've made I've made three I've directed three features. Two of them are yours. Two of them I'd written one one called Wish I Was Here. I wrote with my brother Adam.
01:12:14
And how do you finance that?
01:12:16
Oh, you can vote that one. I got in a bit of a pickle because it someone presented me the idea of trying to crowd fund like half of it.
01:12:29
And this was right at the beginning of Kickstarter being on everyone's radar.
01:12:33
And and I and I said, OK, that's kind of cool.
01:12:37
Like, what if we what if we did that? What if we didn't have a studio and I put it in my own money and we get financing to put in a little bit of money. But then like half the money is comes from promising these incentives, set visits and T-shirts and merch and posters and signed everything and and.
01:12:57
We it became very controversial, I became I think I was the first known actor director to do it, and it became it was so successful, it funded beyond what we asked for in 24 hours.
01:13:10
Right. That that there was instant backlash, saying you shouldn't you as a known entity shouldn't be using this. Right. This should be for people who have no other means.
01:13:21
And it became I unfortunately or fortunately, I guess, became the face of the debate. Should should people who have fan bases be allowed to participate in crowd funding campaigns?
01:13:37
That's where did that land? Well, I think after people weighed in enough, nobody nobody really does it. You know, I was on the cover of Variety being like, is this the new wave of financing?
01:13:50
And and not many people, I think, have ever done it since because of the amount of of of antagonism there was for the very idea which then hurt the film.
01:14:04
I think because I think that people judge the film is like, oh, that's that half crowdfunded movie. Wow. And it was it was a bit of a bummer because I, I really am proud of the film, but not a lot of people saw it.
01:14:18
Well, I'm sorry, buddy and I it's OK. It was years ago so.
01:14:24
And then the one you directed after that going inside. Yeah. So then I got hired, then I had my first big studio come to me and be like, hey, we love that movie and we loved Garden State. Do you ever think about directing like a big studio movie? And I was like, go on, go on.
01:14:39
And it was a remake of of a George Burns movie called Going In Style. And it was Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Alan Arkin starring as three seniors who rob a bank who I remember the original.
01:14:53
I remember you know what I remember the most out of that movie is that that medium shot of Schwartzberg having the heart attack on the bench.
01:15:01
Yeah, it's almost like a long shot, right? I remember it. Right.
01:15:04
And you me you know, Ted, Ted Malfi wrote the script, great screenwriter. And he didn't there's not a ton that's that's still from the original.
01:15:14
I mean, other than the concept of three seniors who were sort of fucked over by society and by the system, get go go rob a bank and ours, ours was able to fold in all this, you know, current day conversation about, you know, corporations, you know, canceling pensions and and the bank has their money and they don't want any they don't want to steal a dime more than the pension that's owed to them.
01:15:38
And. Right. It was great, man.
01:15:40
I got to I got to make a big ass action heist movie in Manhattan and Brooklyn. And and I think it's I think it's really funny.
01:15:48
But was the experience I mean, it's a lot to manage, I guess. But the experience of shooting your own movies, I guess you just sort of like, you know, keep your cool and you've got your DP and you focus on what needs to be done. You get yeah, it's all about the sort of community that you build around the production. Right.
01:16:03
Right. And taking one day at a time because you've got to you if you think about making a big action movie with three seniors in the height of summer in Manhattan, it is impossible.
01:16:15
If you look at the whole thing, you know, we have, you know, everywhere Morgan Freeman walks, there's paparazzi following him and fans. And so it's not it's advanced filmmaking, making an action movie in Manhattan in the summer with celebrities. Right.
01:16:30
So you just got to go, OK, what is today? And you put blinders on, OK, and then now what is this morning, right. And you just keep making it smaller, smaller, smaller.
01:16:41
And if you ignore the fact that you have a huge crew and ignore the fact that you have celebrities and you just go, OK, the first this this morning we're going to make a short film and the short film is called This Scene. And that's how you kind of got it. That's how I approach it.
01:16:56
I just kind of like applied OCD. That's right. Yes, exactly. Yeah. It's ritual to to make it in handleable.
01:17:05
Right, exactly. I did watch the new movie The Comeback Trail. Yeah. And is that based on another movie?
01:17:15
Very loosely, George Gallo, who, you know, made Midnight Run and is sold more screenplays than anybody in Hollywood, is sort of an action comedy writing legend.
01:17:27
Yeah, I saw a years, years and years ago at a festival he saw like a super low budget version of the concept of.
01:17:36
Yes, right. And said to himself, man, this is not well executed, but what a concept. And it always stuck with him. And he went on had years and years of his career.
01:17:48
And then and then and then ran into the the widow of the man who made the film randomly and said, oh, my God, I never stopped thinking of that film. Do you mind?
01:17:59
Would you be would you honor with me with the rights so I could so I could write a sort of big budget action comedy version of it? And she said I'd be honored. So he did just that.
01:18:09
And then he cast Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, Tommy Lee Jones and and me shockingly. So that's what this is. This is this is something I've never really done, which was to be cast. You know, I did the TV show forever.
01:18:25
I've done my own films. I've done. Some smaller films, yeah, I've never been like in a big movie with where I'm one of the lead, I mean, it's basically me and De Niro through most movie, as you saw right now.
01:18:38
Is that something you can go out for?
01:18:40
There was offered you know, George really liked me as a as an actor and liked my stuff. And and I got a call one day saying, George Galloway wants to meet you at his house and talk about the script.
01:18:54
And I was like, go on there. Like, Yeah, De Niro's attached and just read it. And I would have gone I would ran over there if it was two scenes.
01:19:02
Yeah, one scene. But I'm flipping through the script and I'm on fucking every other page. I'm like, are you sure this is the character?
01:19:12
So I said, yeah.
01:19:13
And I said, I do have to read or read. You know, as an actor you're like, this is a big part within your audition for this. If they want me, like, no, no, I just want to talk to you.
01:19:21
Went over his house, cracked up, made him laugh and he started talking about movies. I'm talking about Hollywood. And he goes, look, I want I want you to do it.
01:19:30
This is the only thing got to do is look, Bob happens to be in town and and, you know, I know you met by Bob like, you know, socially once or twice.
01:19:39
Yeah. He said Bob just kind of wants to talk to you. Yeah.
01:19:43
And I'm like, OK, so I go and meet Bob for coffee and I'm so fucking nervous. My palms are sweating, thinking about it. And I don't I don't know what's going to happen.
01:19:54
And he just he's like, you know, we get married.
01:19:56
We're actually he knew Jessica because Jessica Kerson, all circles back to Jessica was his adviser, that movie coach for the for the comedian.
01:20:04
A comedian. Yeah. And so we talked about Jessica.
01:20:08
We talked about did he know that going into it, though, or did you tell him you knew. He knew. Well, that was my ace in the hole I was going to I was going to be like, hey, you know, we've met before. But, you know, Jessica, who's Jessica Biel has become like his good buddy. They've stayed friendly. So anyway, I couldn't have gone better. We laugh, we shoot the shit.
01:20:25
And then as we're walking out, he goes, all right, well, I'll see you on set. And I was like, holy shit, I think I just got this big ass movie.
01:20:33
So we go down to Albuquerque, New Mexico.
01:20:36
That's where I grew up. Really? Hmm. It's it's quite a quite a place.
01:20:41
People I don't know the people always get the best impression of it. I didn't I didn't necessarily have the best impression of it. I think it's I think it's felt like it was on hard times.
01:20:50
It's a little beat up. Yeah. So you shot the whole movie in New Mexico. Yeah. Home shot in New Mexico.
01:20:57
And and it was a blast and I got to know him and work with him and really had to give myself a pep talk after pep talk like dude, you cannot be intimidated by this being DeNiro like you have to.
01:21:08
I don't know if that's ever happened to you when you're working with someone you really admire and you kind of like pretend this is somebody that's not a living legend. It's weird.
01:21:16
I did one scene with him in the Joker and, you know, but I was on set for like a week, you know, watching him. If I had one walk and talk in a scene with him.
01:21:26
Yeah, I remember. I know he became very human to me very quickly.
01:21:29
I made a just because I interview so many people, but like, you know, I definitely within, you know, a half an hour, I'm like, oh, this is this is this guy, Robert De Niro. He's the greatest actor ever. But this is who he is now. And this is his process.
01:21:43
What's very, you know, sort of humanizing in my very brief experience with him anyways, was to just sort of watch his process at this point, like because you make all these assumptions about somebody's process when you watch your movies growing up, you know, but, you know, as an older actor, you know what it takes for him to get the stuff in his head and the kind of the process of that.
01:22:05
You're like, you know, you really you start to see him or I did anyways as a guy who does a job and he's just he's the guy, you know, and that happened.
01:22:15
Yeah, I think he was way I think people don't can't imagine how I found him very shy. Very. And I was with him for a whole movie. So day by every day on a graph, you could I could feel him warming up to me. By the end, we were texting each other and making each other, sending each other funny. Shut the Internet. Yeah. And I've been to dinner at his house since and and and now we become friendly.
01:22:37
But I, I was taken aback by how he would be sitting off in his chair, not really talking to anyone, reading a book or on his phone.
01:22:48
And then he'd come to suddenly call action and there was DeNiro and he'd come to life. And he was intense and he was amazing and brilliant and going forward and and saying, keep the camera rolling. I want to go again. And then and then they go cut.
01:23:00
And he kind of just quietly go back to his chair and pick up his book.
01:23:03
And yeah, I was I was I was surprised by that, that he wasn't like he didn't he wasn't. He was quiet and shy.
01:23:12
But it is true the way those guys can turn it on and the control they have over. You know, I've become very aware of people's faces. Guys that are great at it have this amazing consciousness of their face.
01:23:25
That's interesting. I think I think what what what a lot of film actors who aren't great and don't know is that so many times we as directors just need a shot of you looking out the window, reacting.
01:23:39
I just need yeah. You're trying to do too much.
01:23:42
My girlfriend, I watched, you know, lots of films and TV and we're saying to each other, like, oh, I wish someone had told him or her to just do less, because you can tell the person has talent, but they haven't been directed to trust that the camera's going to take them 75 percent over where they they.
01:24:04
She's an actress, right? Yes.
01:24:05
She's Florence Pugh. She's a phenomenal actress. What did I just hear? And she just did little women. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. She's great. Yeah.
01:24:15
And she's she's the co-star with Scarlett Johansson in the New Black Widow movie. Wow. Yeah, that's exciting. She's doing well. Good man. Well, that was great scene in the movie. Fun movie. Thank you. It was amazing. You know, you know who's like really kind of like surprising in that movie in a way is he's always good.
01:24:37
But Tommy Lee Jones, I mean, you know, that part was like he's one of those guys where, you know, he put the camera on him and he knows exactly how to play it with the face, you know? Yeah.
01:24:49
He has such a face.
01:24:50
He's one of those guys where you look at Tommy Lee Jones in person and you go, OK, that's that's that's that's Tommy Lee Jones. I know that's what he looks like.
01:24:57
And then you look at the monitor when he's on screen and you're just like, holy shit, that's a movie star. He's got movie star. Yeah. With that with that you talk about talk about facial expressions. Right.
01:25:10
And even but De Niro, too. But like De Niro is playing this kind of schleppy guy, which I like to see him do. But there's a couple of monologues in there. When he went that scene between the three of you when he opens up on Tommy Lee, gives him the tells him like, you know, what he's going to do, like you're not going to kill yourself. You're going to go to bed, that whole thing. Yeah, I mean, watching.
01:25:31
I'm there.
01:25:32
I'm going to be sitting there watching in the middle of it. I'm literally in the middle watching Tommy Lee Jones and DeNiro scream at each other. I mean, it's my dream come true. I can't believe it. And how about that scene in the hospital where I have to berate and slap De Niro? I mean, that was one of the coolest things I ever did in my career. I mean, I was just I was that was one of the big ones that give myself a pep talk to, like, I know this is De Niro and I know that you're going to slap him across the face and scream at him.
01:25:58
But you just got to pretend this is John Smith, actor and do not be in your head about, because then then De Niro, then De Niro is going to react to me and he's going to I'm going to it's like playing tennis. He's going to be rise to the occasion, know.
01:26:11
Right. And how many times do you have to do it?
01:26:13
Oh, I did. We did that all day. Yeah. Right. Yeah. But I but you know, it's the first scene in the movie where he's watching me. Right. I'm, I'm driving that scene and I was just like, I wanted, I wanted, I wanted Bob to be proud of me. I was not going to fucking leave anything on the floor.
01:26:31
I was like, oh yeah.
01:26:34
You know, he's in his own little way, a little pat on the back. Oh, good, good. Because, you know, it's interesting, too. I guess working with those guys is like they've worked with, you know, dozens of young actors in all different types of parts. You know, they've seen them come and go and they're like the they're like the mountain. And then they see, you know, these guys come up the mountain.
01:26:55
So it it must have been a really I want I wanted his approval so badly.
01:27:00
I wanted him to to to to to to think I was good.
01:27:05
It sounds like he did. You guys are friends. Yeah. Yeah.
01:27:09
I think I mean I think if you didn't like your work he wouldn't have you at the house for dinner.
01:27:12
You don't have a bad actor over dinner. Come on. All right buddy. It was great talking so much.
01:27:19
