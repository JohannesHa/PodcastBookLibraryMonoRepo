00:00:00
Lock the gate. All right, let's do this, how are you? What the fuckers, what the fuck buddies, what the fuck? Nix what the fuck stirs? What the fuck? FUCKHEADS, Fumiya, how's it going? I'm Marc Maron. This is my podcast. Welcome to it. I don't know how long you've been around, but if you're new here, welcome. Just hang out. We've been doing this for over a decade. Jesus, long time.
00:00:36
And I talk to people I talk to. I have them.
00:00:39
I used to have them come over to the house and I talk to them. And now we figured out a way to do it like everybody else on the computer.
00:00:48
We can you can do it on like my mother. Did you do it on the computer? Are you on the computer today? Did I see you on the computer? Yes. Yeah, we've figured it out.
00:01:02
And I tell you, man, once I got the hang of talking to people on the zoom, it was it turned out it's turned out to be really good. We've really yielded some interesting and deeper talks than I think some of the ones that have happened in person, to be quite honest with you.
00:01:20
It got to the point where I was talking to somebody.
00:01:22
This is weird, but I was talking to somebody the other day on a zoom interview and I was having a memory of talking to somebody years ago, but my brain framed it as if it were a zoom, like I remembered talking to the person. But on Zoom.
00:01:38
So the context has invaded the actual structure of my mind, like my memories are now zoom memories, like I've got Zoom, I've got a screen in my head that I'm looking at things through.
00:01:51
It's a little fucked up. It's a little scary. I'm worried about my mind, Jodie Foster is on the show today.
00:01:59
I mean, you know, Jodie Foster, you know, I mean, taxi driver, we talk a lot about a lot about some of the movies, the ones I remember taxi driver Bugsy Malone, the accused little man Tate, her new movie, The Mauritanian, but also Jodie Foster is one of those people. When you're my age, I am 57 years old, that you feel like you've grown up with her.
00:02:24
And known here your whole life. But I also want to point out that because I was trying to be sensitive about it and not dredge up stuff that she had nothing to do with and got dragged into through no actions of her own, some of you might not know when what I meant when I brought up all the other crap.
00:02:44
You'll be hearing it when I'm talking to her and what I'm referring to when I said all the other crap that she had to deal with around the time she was in college, when we were talking about that.
00:02:58
For those of you who don't know, in 1981, John Hinckley tried to assassinate President Reagan and critically wounded Press Secretary James Brady. And he said he did it to impress to try and impress Jodie Foster. And I think specifically Jodie Foster from Taxi Driver and Jodie Foster, who was then in college, had to deal with the attention. Of that sordid. Type of. Explosion of. Attention. So that's what I was referring to. It's we're just telling you about this makes me remember years ago.
00:03:45
A James Brady story, it's yeah. Press Secretary James Brady, who was critically injured. But he lived and he had brain damage and he was in a wheelchair for the rest of his life, I believe, and. The memory I have of him. Was many years ago, one of the first times I ever did stand up comedy at a comedy club was with Steve Brill, who is a film director and an old friend of mine. From college.
00:04:15
We put together a team act to audition for a show called HBO Live on Campus. It was produced by Catch a Rising Star in HBO. We auditioned for it. We did not get the show, but we were told because we tanked on a live audition, we'd never been in a comedy club before. And the first time was out, I was at a comedy club, was at the comedy connection with Steve, and we just ate it.
00:04:36
But they did promise us that we could do a spot of catch a rising star in New York City. So we at some point went down there. We waited around. We were told we'd have a spot. We went on when there was literally. No one there, almost no one there, maybe 10, 12 people in one of those people was James Brady. I don't know if he enjoyed the show. It sort of made us a little feel a little weird.
00:05:03
But but that's that's that story. Not that exciting. No where to go with it.
00:05:08
Just performed for him once, and he was almost the only person in the room.
00:05:14

00:06:16
So wtf. Today, do it. So I don't know what you're up to with folks, but I just what have I been doing? I watched I've been watching these these Harold Pinter screenplays on the Criterion Channel. I watched a filmed version of his play, The Homecoming, which I found mind blowing.
00:06:38
And I watched the accident and I watched the pumpkin eater. I think it's called Anne Bancroft, all very disturbing, beautifully written, doing a lot of thinking about the writing and doing a lot of thinking about the thinking.
00:06:50
And then somebody told me that Adam Curtis has a new documentary series on the BBC called Can't Get You Out of My Head. Now, if you I don't know if you know Adam Curtis, but I guess it's high time or maybe the timing is perfect for me to take in another Adam Curtis film, because after I watched Hyper Normalisation and the century of Self, it took me, I think, years to kind of process what was put in my head by Adam Curtis.
00:07:21
Now, this new one is the same. He pulls a lot of things together.
00:07:24
He goes out of his way in the first episode of this series to kind of put some things into perspective that need putting into perspective, like understanding how and why conspiracy theories kind of fit into the modern brain. It's a big net he's throwing with a lot of strands tying together. But his tracking of the Illuminati conspiracy back to the discordance, who are almost a a couple of of hippy pranksters looking to to fight against the dominant paradigm and against organized religion and created this religion.
00:08:00
And then they did some kind of pranks in the letter column of Playboy, which introduced the idea that the Illuminati was running the world. It was a joke. It was a fucking joke. And look where we are now. We have the punchline of that joke. At least 80 percent of them trying to take over the US Capitol and stop the elections. The punch lines of a joke, the joke of religion, the joke of the conspiracy, the joke of Zionist occupied government, the joke of connecting the dots in the frightened minds of those who want some sense of closure and order and power, who want to simplify it, to want to find places and things to blame and justification for their hatred and fear.
00:08:48
It started as a fucking hippy prank.
00:08:51
Now look at you. Jesus Christ, but that is not what the documentary series about, it's really about the construction of our minds and our sense of selves and how they relate to the dominant power structure and what power has to do culturally, politically, economically with how we see ourselves literally, with how we see ourselves from our fucking brains.
00:09:17
And I'm only two episodes in and we're already dealing with we're dealing with the the evolution of the government, of this country, of China, of Russia, of film, of literature, in terms of trying to understand the mind, you know, the idea of binary logic and how that was initially used or meant to be an exploration of how the human brain works, but years later was used as the foundation of how artificial intelligence, dude, dude gets people.
00:09:47
He, she, them. You're got to watch it. Look, man, I don't know, I'm sure there's a lot of pushback around it, but the guy's an artist, man. He's a fuckin artist and this is an unpaid plug.
00:10:04
Fucking Adam Curtis always blows my mind and it gets my brain going in waves and it fills in some blanks that need to be filled in. And there's plenty of time to do the thinking. Plenty of time to do the thinking. Oh, I think I'm getting a kitten in a few weeks just to put that out there. Let me ask you a question. Does any of this sound familiar to you?

00:11:28
Can you dig it? So, Jodie Foster, now I'll tell you the high point in my conversation with Jodie Foster, and it's sort of odd because, you know, it just stuck with me. And I'm sure you'll notice that I don't even know if I have to bring it to your attention, but when she recollects an egg salad sandwich in the. Canteen of Disney Studios, the cafeteria at Disney. It was so great to watch her do it.
00:11:54
She went there, man, she went back to that sandwich. This is me talking to Jodie Foster. Her new film, The Mauritanian, is in theaters now and will be available on digital platforms in the near future. It's a true story about the detention of a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay for 14 years without a charge. It's directed by Kevin MacDonald, who some of you might know about from this show, and a mistake involving him several years ago.
00:12:22
But all that aside, this is me talking to Jodie Foster.
00:12:34
I see Jodie Foster in the screen and I hear her. Hi, Jodie Foster. Hi there. How are you? Pretty good.
00:12:41
Pretty good. You know, it's a beautiful day. I'm looking out. I see palm trees and blue sky. I suppose we need to be grateful.
00:12:47
I do that every day. I see palm trees from my porch to and I think, like, it can't be that bad. It's winter. It's 70 degrees. The sky is clear. That is true. And then you look at your phone and you go, oh, fuck, we're in trouble.
00:13:03
Yeah, I guess the moral of the story is maybe at your phone so much.
00:13:07
Right. Right. Try to limit that.
00:13:09
Try to live like do you ever just like wake up and in bed, do it to yourself with the phone. Are you every morning, every morning? Yeah, it's a terrible thing. I don't know, I feel like if I don't if I'm not watching that the world will implode.
00:13:24
You're going to stop. I'm I'm the magic, you know, the magic unicorn that only only I if if I'm not watching, terrible things will happen.
00:13:33
Thank God we made it another day because Jodie Foster looked at her phone when she woke up and woops, what happened?
00:13:42
Oh, you froze up. So I'm going.
00:13:45
Yeah, I got I have to my phone just went on. I have to do that thing. Go like you hover over notifications when you do, there's some like thing you're supposed to do. I don't know how to do it. Oh well can you tell that I'm over 50?
00:14:00
You I can't can't figure out where the mute button is and don't know how to turn the alerts off on my.
00:14:04
Yeah I'm the same. Yeah. But you know, there's some people that are older than us that still have AOL addresses. I mean, I'm assuming that you've moved past the AOL address. That's always a sure fire indicator when you see the AOL address.
00:14:18
Yeah, I have learned a little bit in the last few years, but I have like it's the only place where road rage comes out on me is I have that computer rage. Oh, yeah. Well, if something happens or I lose something or something freezes, suddenly I start screaming and stomping my feet and acting like a five year old.
00:14:38
Right. Because we don't have we don't know what the recourse is. If you're in a car, you pull over the brakes, whatever, you know how to drive a car. Yes, but that powerlessness, that feeling of like I have no idea.
00:14:49
And, you know, that people there are people that know how to do it, but it's not you know, my children know how, but they're teaching me.
00:14:56
So that's OK. I mean, look, the movie business changed a lot and in some ways for the better and in some ways for the worse. I mean, now, for example, you used to have to if you were going to scout for a location, you would send a scout out and that person would travel across the country and then take a bunch of shots on their camera. They would do them in kind of like an arc so that they were able to get a perspective.
00:15:21
They take ten shots, then they go to the one hour photo. They'd sit there and wait for an hour. When they got the photos, they would tape them up with Scotch tape, put them all together, and then they put them in a in an envelope and send them to you.
00:15:34
And you would get them three days later and then you'd look at them and go, oh, I don't know what happens over there. Yeah. And certainly they have to go back to the place nowadays. All you do is push a button on your phone.
00:15:45
Yeah, the guys, they're there already and you can look in real time. That's right. So tighten things up. So now is everybody at home because of a lockdown? Have you been spending an inordinate amount of time with the family? Yes, and it's all good.
00:16:00
Both my boys are leaving. They're going back to college. The little one wasn't able to go to college for his freshman year. So this is what he's been doing it all from Zoome from home. So that was really sad. My older been in college. So that's that's been better.
00:16:13
But your older one, he's he's able to go. Yeah. Older one, older one's been there. He said it's the best he's ever had so go figure.
00:16:18
I don't really know and nobody's gotten sick. Everybody's good.
00:16:22
No, I think his school really figured it out. They have their own testing sites and they're there on top of it. Well, that's great. So they had very little impact. I think people really follow the rules. And as far as my son's concerned, you know, doing school in bed sounds like the best thing he's ever heard.
00:16:40
What is he what are they studying?
00:16:44
My older one is really into theater. Wow. He definitely wants to be an actor. He does a lot of writing and standup standards. Yeah. Oh, do I know him?
00:16:55
I see him as you know. That's OK. You'll you'll know him because he talks about his mom a lot. I mean I think that kind of tells you he doesn't have a lot of experience to find that your standup has a lot to do with your mom.
00:17:07
But as you say, my mother, Jodie Foster.
00:17:10
No, no, she doesn't do that. Thank God he doesn't do that. Do you take a hit? Are you OK with saying? Oh, yeah, I don't mind. I mean, you know, I am one of those people that, like, I dress up for Super Bowl. Sure.
00:17:24
So I don't have a problem. People making fun of me.
00:17:29
You dress up for Super Bowl. I draw the line at playoffs, however. OK, ok, good. Yeah.
00:17:34
It's funny because I was I thinking about you and thinking about my life and now like you've been there my entire life, we're about the same age. And it's weird because I was realizing yesterday when I was thinking about it, like how that Bugsy Malone was a very important movie to me, really.
00:17:50
It was so nice to hear. But it was sort of a big deal, you know, because it was kids in a grown up movie and the gun shop Pye's I mean, it was a big deal. I mean, I don't know what year was that? I mean, how old was I? I don't want to now. I'm going to find out.
00:18:03
I was twelve when I did it, so I was like eleven to eleven or twelve too.
00:18:08
And it was just sort of like it was it was like a really fun like like we were excited to go.
00:18:15
It was like a new kind of movie. Yeah, it was actually it was a British film. A lot of people don't realize that Alan Parker's first movie was entirely a British production. There were four of us, maybe five of us that were brought from the United States and everybody else were kids that were either British or they were living on American army bases in outside of London, really. So it was kind of like going to a very rough public school in Manchester or something.
00:18:47
Yeah, there would be. There were the girls that were the the dancers they did none of them had their parents with them. So they were they were all living in these kind of they had minders and they were living in these dormitories. And there was a whole group of girls from Liverpool and they were the dancers. Wow. And the dancers would go down into the corridors at Pinewood and the dancers would cut you off at the end of the corridor with fire extinguishers.
00:19:16
And they'd say, what's a pass? Would you like that? A Scottish anyways? What's the password be like? I don't know. And they would show you is terrifying.
00:19:28
The trauma, the trauma of the both the Bugsy Malone set.
00:19:32
Yeah, all of us with our bleached hair and our pencil thin eyebrows. And it was really it was a lot of fun. And I think such a creative, interesting film.
00:19:42
Yeah, it was. And it showed up in a black mirror episode. Did it? It did. Like I did.
00:19:48
I just did a movie with Andrea Riseborough and she was in a Black Mirror episode, Crocodile and the Kennedale and the kids were doing Bugsy Malone on stage.
00:19:58
You remember in the school play.
00:20:00
You're right. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. That is right. They go to the school play. Yeah, absolutely.
00:20:05
And then but you directed an episode in the same season of Blackmer and did it because you love that show.
00:20:12
Did you seek that out?
00:20:13
Love that show. I didn't seek it out. They found me and I had actually never seen the show. So when I saw that, I saw the pig episode and I was like, I'm in.
00:20:24
Yeah, he's Tribecca is such an amazing mind. I don't know how he does it. And he writes every single one of those, every single one of those crazy things comes out of his head. And what's strange about him is that he seems to have some kind of weird, prescient. Voodoo thing where he's able to manifest whatever is in his mind, he's able to manifest in the future of the newspaper.
00:20:51
So he just came up with the idea about, you know, bees carrying sort of robot bees carrying viruses and stuff.
00:21:02
And then suddenly that appears. Right, years later in mazing.
00:21:06
So he's that guy. He's the prophet guy. He's a guy where you watch his shows you like we're in trouble.
00:21:11
It is never it never it's it's never a bright future, I guess, with with his prophesy. No, no.
00:21:19
But I you know, I really have to commend him that he's he set out to do something that nobody had really ever done before. This this idea of doing an anthology series where each one was a little feature and he gave complete and total control to the directors, just like you would on a movie. So each director has you know, it's a brand new cast. It's a brand new crew. It's a brand new brand new location, brand new ed, brand new composer.
00:21:47
So you don't have to honor a look at all, you know, there it's up to, you know, I mean, they have some ideas about what they're looking for, obviously.
00:21:55
And he was a wonderful producer that travels with you. But no, it's really up to the director. And I thought that was so brave of him to do that. And I think that's what makes the the show as powerful as it is.
00:22:05
Yeah. Because you you layer in a real auteur vision as opposed to just hire a director to honor the vision that's already there.
00:22:14
Yeah. I mean, I love you know, I've loved every one of the episodes in that season. I just thought it was extraordinary. I mean, look at something like crocodile. And it couldn't be any more different than what I did with the Archangel.
00:22:26
And my film is like a little little indie movie about a mother and a daughter. Right. And I really want to keep that indie, that kind of messy indie spirit. And you look at some of the other movies in there. I mean, we were just talking about crocodiles.
00:22:39
So you look at that with that incredible landscape that almost Icelandic land is, I think it is architecture houses and just extraordinary, bleak and beautiful.
00:22:50
And she said that her part it was written for Guy Pearce and she. Yeah. And she pushed them to give her the part.
00:22:59
Good for her. Good for her or see, sometimes I've done that before where you shift the gender and there's sometimes it works and it's just incredibly powerful and other times, you know, it should never happen.
00:23:12
But you've done it as a director or as a as a you took a role as an actress.
00:23:18
Yeah, really. I did that, I think for flight plan that was originally a man and which really didn't make any sense. So with the second you change it to a woman and suddenly there was a whole history of female hysteria, the idea of female hysteria and how that's translated into other films. And then it suddenly became so much more rich.
00:23:41
Right? Well, why wouldn't it's a completely different point of view. So I used to do a joke in my act about how people who come to Hollywood expecting to become stars are our sort of misunderstanding the situation out here. I used to say that Hollywood isn't your parents. They're not here to take it's not here as an entity to take care of you and and continue your adulthood and guide you. But oddly, it kind of was your parents, wasn't it?
00:24:12
Well, it was definitely my brothers and sisters for sure. I feel like I was raised by I was raised on movie sets by all of these wonderful people who taught me hard lessons. And they did really cared about me and took care of me. Yeah.
00:24:25
I mean, I know how to would whittle wood for some reason from where you are, where you are not on the Mayberry's set and some Teamster.
00:24:35
I don't know. I think it was on Tom Sawyer. I spent a lot of time whittling wood. And I know, you know, I came to really understand the camera from from every technician's point of view, which was nice to kind of get that film school for them.
00:24:50
Yeah. With your mom, though, your mom was in show business now. Well, I guess she was. Yeah, she had been a publicist before I was born for a kind of fame famous guy.
00:25:00
Which guy at Arthur Jacobs. The producer. Right. He became a producer originally.
00:25:06
He was a he was a manager and a publicist.
00:25:09
He sort of a character, though, right? Know, he sort of he was he produced the Planet of the Apes, Dr. Doolittle, didn't he, Dr. Doolittle? Yeah, he did. But when he was a publicist, he handled Grace Kelly and he handled Marilyn Monroe.
00:25:22
Actually, I think that he was like the first person who was on scene when Marilyn Monroe died.
00:25:27
Really? And your mom worked for him? Yeah, I'm just reading about him in this book about about those five movies, The Transition.
00:25:35
Dr. Doolittle, The Graduate in the Heat of the Night. Guess who's coming to dinner and. Bonnie and Clyde, it's all those movies put together, Mark Harris is the guy's name. He's Tony Kushner's husband and he's written three books. He just wrote a book about Mike Nichols and he wrote this book.
00:25:55
It's sort of the same angle as Baskin's book.
00:25:58
But his his his thesis is that it happened earlier, that the transition started in the early to mid 60s with the graduate in the heat of the night, Bonnie and Clyde.
00:26:09
And it wasn't, you know, the explosion of those those guys that happened in the early 70s. But Doolittle was sort of the end of it. That's I think.
00:26:19
Yeah, but Jacobsen's is all over this book, and it's just like I don't you know about it because, you know, you did it.
00:26:25
But he really gets into the nuts and bolts of producing a movie like Doolittle and what a disaster it just unfolded into. And Port Arthur Jacobs was was ailing. He was he was having heart problems. And it was like it was like it almost killed them.
00:26:41
Yeah. There's lots of wonderful stories about how movies are made. You know, it's really I just have such nostalgia. I mean, it's my whole childhood. Do you remember Walt Disney? No, I never met Walt Disney.
00:26:54
I think he's probably dead by the time I was pretty young. But I knew Ryan Miller, who run the studio after that, his son in law. And I knew everybody at Disney as I was a Disney kid. Right. Right. Like four or five films like Kurt Russell.
00:27:06
Was he around? Yeah, he was around. I mean, I've met him vaguely. I don't remember because I was a kid and he was older. But, yeah, Kurt Russell was around that same time period.
00:27:15
It must've been crazy on the set at Disney. I mean, it just it was I tended to do I did a lot of movies with animals and all of my movies were on location. So I never really worked on stage. I guess I worked on stage for one part of, like Freaky Friday. I guess I worked on stage for some of it over there. But yeah, my memories of Disney is, you know, they they used to invite me to all of the Disney events at the park.
00:27:40
Yeah.
00:27:40
And I would have to kind of like being a parade or, you know, that kind of thing. Right. I loved it. I loved it. I got to see the opening of the the Abraham Lincoln ride that was there on Main Street and President Tall or whatever. Yeah. And I was there for Jungle Something Jamboree.
00:28:02
Oh yeah. Yeah. The Bears Jamboree. The Bears. Yeah. And so I got to take my family and go around. So I remember that. I also remember the commissary at Disney that they had. I discovered egg salad sandwiches. I'd never had an egg salad sandwich. And I remember that's a big deal. Well, it was the perfect egg salad sandwich because it was super cold and right.
00:28:21
Iceberg lettuce.
00:28:22
Now, that's those are good memories. But now how does it kind of fact, when did you start to realize? Like, because it was pretty clear early on that you had, you know, you you were kind of a whiz kid and you could take on your languages and everything else.
00:28:39
I mean, but was that did you ever when you were a kid, think that show business was like you wanted to do something else early on or you just so immersed in it that that was your life?
00:28:51
Well, I never thought I would be an actor when I grew up. And my mom was very keen on asking me all the time, like, oh, so are you going to be a lawyer or are you going to be a doctor or you know, she really she did not want me to grow comfortable with the idea that I would be an actor when I grew up because no child actors ever grow up to be adult.
00:29:10
Yeah, it never goes well. Rarely.
00:29:13
Yeah, well. And I don't know. There never goes well. I think most child actors it goes well. You just never hear from them again because they become real estate people, they become healthy people who have regular lives. Yeah.
00:29:25
So she, she didn't want to encourage it. And I think she, she kept telling me that by the time that I was fifteen or sixteen that my career would be over. And what did I want to do after that. So I never thought I would be an actor.
00:29:39
And I kind of thought as a very young person, I thought it was a dumb job because all I understood it to be was, you know, you learn lines that someone else wrote and then you sent them.
00:29:50
And that just seemed I just there was no way that I was going to be happy with just that. But.
00:29:56
So you had a knack for it. No one ever you never went to a class or you never trained you never. It was just you just had a knack for it.
00:30:03
Yeah, I guess so. And I worked with a lot of child actors, some who who have undergone some training ends and some like the little boy and little man, Tate. But anything I mean, he had never even been in a school play. He just was a kid that my casting director found in a public school in Manhattan. You know, that was it. It's it's not necessarily something you can teach.
00:30:26
But what you get when you have very young actors is that there's a kind of self-consciousness that they don't have when they're very young. So somebody before they're nine, nine years old, they're the you know, they don't have the kind of self-consciousness you start getting at nine, ten, eleven, twelve years old. So, yeah, I didn't think I would be an actor, and then I went to college, I thought, oh, well, after college my mom said after college, you know, you won't be an actor anymore.
00:30:50
And then I continued and then she said, when you turned 40, after you turned 40, work again. I'm not complaining that I turned 40. I was like, I better work a lot. And then it kept going.
00:31:02
She kept thinking you were. But she had to have seen at some point that, you know, you were definitely branching out and that your business and your intellect and your creativity had become much bigger than acting.
00:31:13
Yeah, I think she was pretty proud of that. I mean, she was proud of of directing and she was very supportive of that. She was really supportive of me going to college and which at the time I think was really anathema for her. For an actor. Well, yeah.
00:31:28
I mean, it reminded me of it. And it's always sort of this weird big deal when actors go to like I remember when Natalie Portman and Claire Danes, like, you know, any actress that decides to stop and go to school, it's like, oh, my God, what's what are they doing, you know?
00:31:45
And it was such an important step for me.
00:31:47
Yeah, well, going back to like, did you like you're talking about Dr. Doolittle. We're talking about this shift. I mean, you were doing television like all the old television, like black and white television even.
00:31:57
Right. A bit at the beginning. Yeah.
00:31:59
So you knew all these you knew, like, you know, Rod Serling and Andy Griffith and all these, you know, like that. What's his name? Arnett from Gunsmoke.
00:32:07
You worked with all those guys? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Gunsmoke, I did. All those all those, you know, traumatic opuses like Nanny and the professor. Yeah.
00:32:18
My three sons and all this seven shows. You remember Fred MacMurray. Nice guy. Yeah. Very nice guy. Yeah. Partridge Family. He did The Partridge Family.
00:32:28
I yeah I was. Although I think all they did one show, The Partridge Family, I went out for The Partridge Family to be a regular, to be one of the kids and I didn't get.
00:32:36
So in your mind, like when you think back on some of these people that you've come across in your life, I mean, are there people that stood out to you as a kid that you had more of an impact than others kind of feel?
00:32:48
Well, Taxi Driver really changed everything, I think, until I did Taxi Driver and I was 12 years old when I did Taxi Driver. And I think that I didn't really take it all very seriously as much as I loved movies. And I really was. My mom was a big fan of films and we saw lots of foreign films and we would see movies over and over and over again and you could understand French.
00:33:06
So that was good for the film. Yeah. So we were really a big movie family, big fan family. But even though I loved movies, I just I didn't understand that acting was more than just saying lines until I did Taxi Driver. And that to me was like a it was just like a mind altering trajectory for me.
00:33:27
And was it the sort of the triangle of you and DeNiro and Scorsese? I think he took the time.
00:33:34
I think De Niro really took the time with me. SCORSESE It kind of sent the two of us out. Or maybe DeNiro did it on his own because he at that time, he was very immersive. Yeah. And he picked me up every day in New York. And we go to a different diner and we just keep running the lines, which I didn't really understand why we kept running the lines over and over again. And then by the third time that we did this, he started improvising and going off on all these tangents.
00:34:02
And at that point, I think we felt comfortable with each other enough to be able to go back into the extra time.
00:34:07
It was something about that process that I really understood that it was my fault as an actor that I had not contributed enough and that there was a whole rich universe of understanding in terms of character that I had just been, you know, blind to, really.
00:34:24
And he just sort of realized that through the repetition and then through improvising. Yeah.
00:34:29
And then watching the scene take place, watching what Scorsese he did, then ultimately really seeing the movie and seeing how those things all dovetailed and how they came together. It was such an inspiring experience. And it probably also coincided with all those amazing movies like Lenny. Yeah, you know, Straw Dogs and Cowboy, all those when you were 12. Oh, yeah. We're a big, big, big, big, big movie family. And and we saw really serious movies.
00:35:00
I mean, my mom never she never kept me away from r rated films.
00:35:04
And yeah, we saw some pretty serious movies when you were on the set, like in talking like even in that that thing we were talking about earlier, the shift in how movies were made and the shift in Hollywood.
00:35:15
Did you feel that this set was different? I mean I mean, you've been on, you know, fifty sets already.
00:35:21
Yeah, it was different. You know, of course, every director that you work with is different. So Scorsese, he was his his method was more unusual than I had seen before. He did. He used hundreds of thousands of feet of film and he did take after take after take after take of the same. Think again, same angle, and he had just that was his deal, which is just to have an exhausted, exhaustive amount of film and to comb through it and just look for surprises, you know?
00:35:53
Yeah.
00:35:54
So you got an Oscar for that, right?
00:35:56
No, I got nominated for a supporting, which was you won an Oscar for the accused and Sound. Yeah. Those are great movies. Yeah. Those are some good friends.
00:36:07
I didn't mean I didn't think it was rude that I ask you those questions now. I don't care who I am.
00:36:12
Well, it's important, but so is it. Yeah, of course it's important.
00:36:17
I mean, I was thinking about that. I was talking to my producer yesterday about the accused and I'd seen it. I saw it not too long ago. And I said to him, I said, I think that's one of the best performances of anything ever like.
00:36:30
Yeah. Yeah.
00:36:31
Because, you know, I don't have any objectivity about that performance. Why is that? You know, I kind of felt it was interesting. I felt like a little bit of a failure when I made that movie because there were things that the producers and the director wanted. We're trying to encourage me to do differently. And I couldn't, like, know well, like, I really I felt like I really came to understand the character.
00:37:02
And I had made these decisions about the character that I just couldn't abandon, even though they asked me to abandon them in order to accomplish some kind of goals they had.
00:37:11
Like which ones? Well, I remember, for example, that the producer who I really I really loved this guy, Stanley Jaffe, he just was so cool, that crazy guy. Right. And definitely made a lot of people nuts, but I really liked him.
00:37:26
He was an old timer, too, right? Been around a long time. Yeah.
00:37:30
He made me he he exerted a lot of power on the set. He was there every day and he had a lot of opinions about everything from how many my miniskirts should be to how I should smoke. Right. And I was a smoker at the time and he was not happy with how he smoked.
00:37:50
And he made me reshoot like twice, reshoot the same scene twice because of the way I smoked.
00:37:57
And I was just like, sorry, how.
00:38:00
Yeah. How are you? That's the way it is.
00:38:03
And how are you going to go change something like that and get hung up on it in the middle of that performance? Are you going to worry about.
00:38:10
Yeah, there was a lot of there was a lot of I think there was a lot of intervening at the time because I think people were worried. They were worried that, oh, she's too tough for oh, she's too unlikable or she's and granted, there was a part of me that worried about that, too. I just couldn't do it any differently. I just knew her and that's how she was.
00:38:28
So, for example, the courtroom scene, I think we had a lot of problems with the courtroom scene. They had a lot of problems with it in the court. And I think that Jonathan was hoping or expected for a different kind of performance and the one that I was able to give. So when I finished that movie, I just felt like a bad actor. I just felt like, wow, I'm a bad actor because I couldn't make this character more likable for them, you know?
00:38:50
But that's such a weird kind of Hollywood note. And now that I'm thinking about. Yeah, about Stanley Joff Jaffe, he's one of those guys that had a reputation of being sort of a control freak, I think. Yeah.
00:39:00
Yeah. He's freelancing. Sherry Lansing's producer at Paramount as well. And yeah, he did. Yeah. Lots of big movies. I really like the guy, so I have a real fondness for him. And he just came back. He was kind of old school and I think they didn't really understand what they had and they were worried. I think they were worried that the character would be offensive to people. And I guess it's interesting, I sort of internalized that and I was like, gosh, I wish I could make her less offensive.
00:39:25
I'm so sorry. This is what I got. And in the end, I think, you know, I think it was instinct and I think I was right. And it really taught me that you can't accommodate other people when it's about fear.
00:39:38
It's also part of it also works for the character. I mean, like that to create that insecurity in that overcompensating and the attempting to please everybody, you know, in these moments. I mean, that that is part of the the the brokenness of that character. And and I think that what they probably misunderstood was the vulnerability that you were able to access in the middle of all that, because it wasn't it wasn't something in movies necessarily.
00:40:05
Yeah. And that's OK.
00:40:07
Like this is part of the process. This is why we do what we do. We fight for things that we know are important, even though we don't understand why they're important. And sometimes that channel in that process of challenging authority and challenging other people, like that's how movies get made. So I don't I don't have a problem with that. I feel like that's that's kind of what we do. But it's hard for me because I'm a people pleasing good girl.
00:40:28
I like to take notes and I like race and I'm not a rebel. And so that movie taught me a lot.
00:40:37
But you've able to you've able to manage. That that particular problem, people pleasing part. Yeah, yeah, no, I yeah, I think I have you know, there's there's parts of it that I've learned to let go of and then other parts of it that I'm just, you know, just damned. Yeah. And with.
00:40:57
Well, I guess the big challenge is just making sure you have some boundaries and you don't let yourself get trampled.
00:41:03
Yeah. Look, sometimes you make a choice in a character and it's a bad choice. That's really possible. I've made I've made mistakes with a character before and I can look later and go like, oh, maybe I shouldn't have done that or whatever, but the only thing you can do is operate on operate on instinctually what you know to be true.
00:41:20
And you make that you you have to live by that, whether it works for the film or whether it doesn't work for the film, because if you don't have that, you have anything.
00:41:27
But the accused was a huge movie because it seemed like, you know, when you went after you went off to college, you know, I don't know a lot of those movies. Do you remember the.
00:41:36
Yeah, I made five movies while I was in college, and none of them were successful. None of them.
00:41:42
Yeah. Did you did you like any of those movies?
00:41:45
Yeah, I loved Hotel, New Hampshire. I thought that was a great movie.
00:41:48
That was sort of it was one of those big casts, right. Yeah.
00:41:51
I Hotel New Hampshire. I'm trying to think which are the other ones. Netflix's bad but that blood of others that was um.
00:42:03
Yeah. I mean they're all adventures. They just weren't they. The movies didn't quite work and like and also.
00:42:08
But you had to deal with all that other crap too that you were dealing with that somehow you managed to.
00:42:15
That must have been some lesson in creating personal boundaries that the John Hinckley stuff.
00:42:22
Yeah, it was it's a it's a weird moment in my life. But you, like, transcended. It was kind of amazing.
00:42:30
Yes. I mean, I skillfully transcended. Right.
00:42:33
Because my mom, who had been a publicist, was very clear that she she tried to to guide me to make sure that I wasn't just going to be known as the person who was involved in, you know, who is the involved in the shooting. The president attached to it. Attached to it. Yeah. So she said, you know, you want to have a career that's not about this, so you're going to never talk about it. And, you know, you'll do whatever you need to do for the court case and then that's it.
00:43:03
You won't talk about it. What I what I did is I wrote a piece for Esquire magazine that was sort of a first person piece, and I had an attachment to them because I had worked there. Yeah. As an intern. And that was it. I had written what I had to write about it. I got it out and there was nothing more to say about it.
00:43:21
And that's and that was policy. Yeah.
00:43:24
It took some enforcement. I'm not sure that you can enforce that these days because, you know, we have a different relationship with the press now. I don't know. What do you make of that?
00:43:34
How do you characterize that different relationship? It's just a different time, you know, it's a different time, it's a different culture, you know, we didn't have long lenses like that, zoom lenses. We didn't have the Internet. We didn't have social media. Thank God. You know, we just it was just a different time to grow up. And I feel sorry for four young actors that are growing up in this time that are are trying to navigate becoming humans and being a celebrity at the same time.
00:44:05
Like, I don't really know how to do that.
00:44:07
Right. Because there's also the pressure to have the role of what you decide your private life.
00:44:14
What of it is going to be available and how you're going to handle that like there's no way to avoid it.
00:44:20
Yeah, it's not entirely in your control. I don't know. I mean, it was a different time then. I feel very lucky that I was raised in that time and not this one.
00:44:28
And when did you know that you had succeeded in distancing yourself from that? From what? From from the Hinckley problem?
00:44:37
I don't know that I did. I think, you know, we took a lot of enforcement and. Yeah, I don't know that I did.
00:44:47
I mean, I don't know. I guess I did the best I could.
00:44:50
Well, I mean, I didn't it was weird because when I knew I was going to talk to you and after I watched the new movie, like I and then I was just sort of thinking about you that I didn't realize until two days ago, I I texted my producer.
00:45:04
I'm like, oh, yeah, that Hinckley thing.
00:45:06
Like, it wasn't it was nowhere near the first thing I thought about. And I grew up with you. Yeah.
00:45:12
Yeah. That was you know, it's a testament to my mom. I will get you know, I think she was able to to find a good strategy to make sure that that happened.
00:45:21
And how much how much did it affect your personal life in general, just in terms of being out in the world and doing stuff? And I guess the whole thing was kind of isolating.
00:45:31
Yeah, it was just, you know, it was a weird time in history. It really was weird for me personally. Weird time for the movie business and. Yeah, weird. Strange.
00:45:42
And you started directing pretty shortly after the accused. No, no. Oh, but I guess it was short in real years, I guess short, so I was twenty twenty six and a half, twenty seven years directed the accused. I was probably a year out of college, two years out of college. I was probably like twenty four. Wow.
00:46:03
I mean I, you know, I'm just thinking about the accused. I like that. I mean that movie just had such an effect on me. And also I think it's it's relevant to sort of destructive groupthink, you know, horrendous transgressions that are done by people who are kind of like just glom on to evil.
00:46:22
Well, it's a human phenomenon. You know, they're all human beings. It's a human phenomenon. Yeah. I mean, it was an eye opening experience for me. And I was young. I was I was only twenty four.
00:46:31
And I'm not sure I, I think I came on to that movie with a lot of fears and a lot of unconsciousness, and it wasn't an aware person at twenty four. So I like I read the script once and you know, maybe I met with one rape counselor but that was pretty much all the research I did. Besides going dancing a lot in clubs like that was pretty much it. And I think I was scared to think about it any more than that.
00:46:59
I didn't really want to think about it.
00:47:02
Right.
00:47:02
So I think that performance came out of that out of that unconsciousness.
00:47:07
Was the dancing in clubs the scariest part of the research?
00:47:11
It was the most fun part of the research.
00:47:14
But did you see those men around? No, not really.
00:47:18
I mean, that's not how I think. I just wanted to be in the experience of feeling free right now, because that's you have to you have to have that in order to have this sequence feel impactful. Yeah. What happens before that sequence is very important. Like, this is a woman who is who's having the best night of her life. You know, she feels free and confident and that she doesn't have to feel threatened. She's be yourself.
00:47:45
So, so heartbreaking, the whole thing. But like when you did Silence of the Lambs before Little Man Tate came out, huh?
00:47:53
So Silence of the Lambs, that happened pretty quickly. Well, I mean, I guess within a couple of years. And that that character again, how did you approach that character?
00:48:05
Well, that one there was a lot of research to do on that one. Right. So I went to I read a lot of books. I go to the FBI did. Yeah.
00:48:13
I spent some time in Quantico. I spent a few days in Quantico. I slept over there and stuff and hung out with people. I met with a bunch of FBI people. I did a lot of research there, you know, on forensics and on shooting guns and, you know, climbing the marine things.
00:48:30
And but it's interesting that the core of that thing is also sort of know your vulnerability in the face of monsters.
00:48:37
Well, that's the the greatest thing about sounds. Lansat, I think why it is such a great film is that the book was just this almost magical unicorn that came out of nowhere.
00:48:51
I think it's it's the best thing that Thomas Harris has ever written for sure.
00:48:55
And so inspired and so inspired all of us, actually every single one of us, whether it's Ted Talley the writer or Howard Shaw the composer or me and Tony and John and Demi or Tak Fujimoto the DAP, I think it's for all of us.
00:49:11
It's the best work that we've ever done. And we all have this, like, sinking feeling that we'll never reach that again. And mostly it's because the book was just this perfect thing. It gave so much detail to those characters and so much texture to it that all of us were just completely inspired, you know? Yeah.
00:49:36
I mean, definitely it's one of those movies that it all comes together for sure on screen, every part of it. Yeah.
00:49:42
And that's a testament to Jonathan. You know, I was worried about Jonathan when I when I first when I first knew he was going to be the director because I'd really wanted to do that movie for a while. I'd read the book and I tried to optioned the book as a producer and just really wanted to do it. And I wasn't able to nail it down. And then it got given to Jonathan's direction and I thought, oh, married to the mob.
00:50:00
Yeah.
00:50:00
My God, you know, he's going to grab onto the kitsch party and he's not going to respect Clarice and.
00:50:07
Right. And I told him that. I mean, I told him that that I was worried about it.
00:50:10
Wow. What did he say? He's a psycho. He's kind of a silly guy, right? He wears white shirts and he's laughing and he's joyful and happy and energetic.
00:50:17
And and I think that what he did was he really managed the right balance, that he was able to honor the genre part of it and to not take that part too seriously and yet to keep it as serious as a heart attack and really respect Clarice. And he got into the movie because he loved Clarice and really respected her. And if you come at the movie from that point of view, it's a very different film than it might have been, had just been like a monster movie.
00:50:44
When you bring up the deep the DP. Now, Mike, I'm thinking about because some of the most interesting parts of that movie were the kind of routines of the FBI, right, in that like all of a sudden you get into the world of the killer with the butterflies in the chaos all within that one house sort of up against this kind of, you know, anything shot at the FBI, just like people doing exercises that have a regimen to them.
00:51:10
And then you just enter this bug infested chaos, pit of death. And it's like the juxtaposition is as powerful. And I just talked to Scott Glenn a few weeks ago. He's he's he's fucking amazing.
00:51:22
I love Scott. I see him all the time because we ski together. Oh, you do live there. And, you know, and catch him in Idaho. And I see him a lot. Him and his wife. Yeah. Carol, yeah.
00:51:31
Yeah. I mean, she seems amazing too, with the ceramics and cool.
00:51:35
He's such a cool guy. He's such a tough, tough Marine. He's like a Marine feminist. Right. You don't really like his whole life is about feminism. Yeah. About letting women take charge.
00:51:47
And he's just and this he's a super, you know, muscle bound guy from the Marines who likes to shoot guns. And yet he gets so he's just like the great liberal warrior.
00:52:00
So when you did Little Man Tate, was that kind of you reconciling with some of your genius kid stuff?
00:52:05
Yeah, I don't know that I was a genius kid. I mean, I think I was a prodigious kid and prodigious at something. Right. That's I was just born in me and that was really, you know, wasn't math. It wasn't science. It was the ability to understand psychology, language psychology. So, yeah, I felt I felt like in a way it was like this. It was felt like an autobiography. And yet it's not about my life at all.
00:52:32
I really worked with Scott Frank on the screenplay a lot as a young filmmaker and was able to really talk about things from my past and, you know, develop the characters of the two women that the screenplay was a bit different when I got it and we really shifted it to be about this. It's almost like two women raising this child. Right. And who is this herald of a new age? You know, what does it mean to be a prodigy?
00:52:59
A prodigy means you stand outside of this generation and you straddle into another generation and you're going to bring everybody with you. You know, that that hope that you had for that little boy and the fueled by the disappointment of these two women that he came from. No, these two opposite sides. I mean, yeah, I love that movie.
00:53:20
Yeah. It was it was a great movie. And it was like. But did you like producing?
00:53:27
I didn't produce that one technically, even though I had to kind of you know, there was a lot to do because Orion went into bankruptcy. Right.
00:53:34
When you're involved with that screenplay. Right. And there's. Yeah. So there was a lot to do about trying to get the movie released and all that. And I had a deal with Orion and I was had a deal with Ryan at that time. So I was producing other movies to Ryan. So yeah, I might as well produce a little on tape, but I, I do, I do.
00:53:53
I like producing my own films. Yeah. Other than that I don't enjoy producing. Yeah. I think it's hard, it's hard because you're always looking for things that are wrong and there's a lot of like manipulation and there's a lot of like strategizing people and politics, working them against each other or for each other. And that's just that's just not my way.
00:54:11
Yeah. I read that. And that's what's horrible about reading when I read about how movies are made and how the actors are just played like game pieces and and because of their egos and their neediness, they're either they don't really realize it or they're just willing to to to be used like that.
00:54:29
It's sort of it's very disconcerting as as an actor in a way, to realize that, you know, management and talent agents and producers are just going to pit you against yourselves, against other people. They're going to use you as a bargaining chip. There's a million things that the talent gets used for. Yeah, that's true.
00:54:49
And I mean, the whole point of having a production company was to protect people, was to protect filmmakers. Right. To protect the process and to protect the products. Yeah, that's why I called the egg. You know, that idea of sort of your production competition.
00:55:06
Yeah. Yeah.
00:55:07
And and we made some you know, I don't think I'm the greatest producer in the world, but we made some movies that I'm really proud of. There isn't any film that we made that I'm not proud of. And yet at the same time, it was clear when I finished the twelve years of producing that like, yeah, I've done enough of that.
00:55:24
I thought now was a pretty gutsy movie. It's really like to to to to do that role.
00:55:30
I mean, your ability or your willingness to explore certain types of vulnerability is pretty amazing.
00:55:39
I mean, like it must it's pretty terrifying for me to even think about really all of them, like the. Used or Karris or or Nele specifically, it was basic, I mean, I know he felt a little insecure about the accused for these reasons, but did you feel uncomfortable with the vulnerability in retrospect of now?
00:56:02
I think that I was I was I mean, obviously, I was drawn to Nel because I developed a play and got it off the ground and did all the years of work that I did to get that on screen.
00:56:17
But I was scared of it. She is the most unlike me of any thing that I've ever played, and I didn't know that I would have what it took. I think that I was scared of vulnerability and scared of. Being somebody like that, like I thought that if I was like that, I would just explode into a million pieces, like I just couldn't imagine. And I didn't really know how to create that character.
00:56:40
I was just so, so confused about how to create that character. And so it really was the greatest acting lesson of my life where I realized, like, oh, all I have to do is drink coffee and show up and it will come because it's inside.
00:56:54
There wasn't any books I can read particularly or research that I could do. Like I had to just trust that when somebody said action that I would be able to be there.
00:57:04
And you had to let go of a lot of who you are, who I am, the construction of you.
00:57:11
Yeah. I mean, you know, it didn't mean that I didn't, like, go into a trance or anything, right? No, but you get your money, but you let yourself be unafraid.
00:57:21
I let myself be unafraid. And I, I really. I think that. I allowed myself to believe in Troll's, right, and you have to believe in trolls sometimes and it doesn't really matter whether they're real or not, it's because the belief is, you know, that's the whole point. Right. You know, when you're shepherding an audience through an experience like that, you have to be 100 percent authentic or the movie doesn't work. So there's there's a lot of pressure that comes with that.
00:57:51
But there's also a lot of power to the fact that it's all riding on your performance.
00:57:57
And if it's real, it works. And if it's not real, doesn't work. Right.
00:58:03
And you can see parts like I like I haven't done a lot of movies, but I imagine that as somebody who's done a lot of movies, when you look back at the ones where you can say, like, I don't know if I was there, I don't love that performance, you just you just let it go, right? I mean, you know, you can't get hung up on it.
00:58:20
Yeah, well, you can get hung up. You can waste a lot of years getting hung up. But no, I don't. I mean, that's something I learned as a child. Yeah. That as an actor, I just don't have any control of it. I have to just go. And there are rituals to do that. I feel like there's always a ritual about that, you know, letting go when I'm when I'm hanging out the window on my way to the airport after the wrap party.
00:58:40
Yeah. And, you know, we wrapped at six a.m. and I, like, throw all my shit in my thing and then there I am and I'm out the window and I, I undo the window and I realize, like. Half of me just finished this massive thing, right, like I just finished climbing Mount Everest. Yeah. So I'm like.
00:58:59
And then the other half is like not quite back in the real life of who I am. And there's a little fear about that. That's the most delicious moment. And that's like I feel like that's a ritual for me where I just feel like, OK, yeah. Yeah, that's. Yeah.
00:59:13
Now that we're the in between the relief of being in between worlds.
00:59:18
Yeah. Where you don't have the anxiety of like do I measure up, you know, can I do it. Well you just did it on your hand and then 10 minutes later or when you get off the plane on the other side nela suddenly you can be like yeah, that's where the anxiety that you don't measure up, you know, oh my God, I don't know how you know, it's amazing that you still that that happens having spent your life in show business.
00:59:43
But I guess that's the nature of this town. I think it fuels it, too.
00:59:47
You know for sure in security field fuels that you want to do the right thing you want to do. You want to go deeper. You want to be better because you keep looking for people to love you or for you to love yourself.
00:59:58
You're better. Do you want you want to be right? If I don't get better people right, people are going to love me. So I better get better.
01:00:04
And you got you want to be recognized for it and you're putting your your life you're putting your creativity in the hands of I mean, you know, throughout your life, mostly a lot of men that's for sure. Like Director.
01:00:14
I mean I, I want to be judged for the best thing that I am. I don't want to be judged for like my shoes. Right. You know, or some. Some dumb thing I want to judge. So that's why it it forces me to give as much as possible to go as deep as possible, to be as authentic as possible, because I'm afraid I don't trust anything else. Like, I'm not very good at picking shoes. So if we're going to judge me on my shoes, like I'm going to fail, I think that there are certain movies.
01:00:47
There're certain movies that are like that. I mean, flight plan, for example, you know, that's a super genre movie about like a woman on a plane missing her child. And there's terrorists. And those kind of that movie was really hard because all the pressure was for me as a character to transcend all that other stuff. Like if you don't believe her, the whole movie is shit.
01:01:10
Right?
01:01:11
So there was a lot of a lot of pressure to make sure that you create a character that is one hundred percent real. Right. Well, you brought this up twice. So that was the real lesson, that movie.
01:01:23
Oh, yeah. Did I bring it up twice, you know. Yes, it was it was hard. It was a hard movie. Yeah. The challenge of doing a film that in some ways is kind of like a Hollywood construct.
01:01:36
Right. And, you know, imbuing it with that that heart and that realism to allow people to grab on to that so that they can believe in troll's, you know.
01:01:47
Right. And like you've worked with some like Fincher, you work with Fincher that. And everybody says that's like you want to hear a funny thing about Fincher. I did a two and a half hour conversation with him.
01:01:58
Right.
01:01:58
And he didn't he he didn't think it was right. So he didn't know he wouldn't let us release it. So I'm sitting on this two and a half hour conversation with David Fincher. He's like, I don't know, let's let's hold off on it, because I think I could do more.
01:02:13
So, like, he's. Yeah, but he's crazy, right? He seems to be this like this perfectionist, you know, tormented guy. He is.
01:02:22
And he's really funny and I love him. Yeah. You know, he's just he just makes me want to put my arms around him and tell him, you know, what is going to be OK. That's going to be OK. You need to, like, chillax. And I love him for it. I love him that he is so committed and that he gives a hundred thousand times more than anybody else on that movie. I mean, and he can do any of our jobs better than we can.
01:02:44
I mean, he's a better actor than I am. He's a better prop master. He's a better DP, really. So I am always just bow down in the presence of somebody who really is just so gifted and so committed.
01:02:56
But it's hard to be David Fincher.
01:02:57
I wouldn't want to be him, but he didn't drive you crazy you after. So he doesn't drive me crazy.
01:03:03
I love him. He makes me laugh. Right. And it's true that it's annoying that you have to do as many takes as you do. And I was pregnant, so don't forget I was pregnant on panic room. Wow. And and by the end of it, I mean, I was to six months we're almost six months pregnant by the end of it. And by the end of it, I could move. I literally could not walk down the street.
01:03:21
I couldn't move. I had to go on bed rest after that for another three weeks. And and despite all of that, like, I would just do anything for him. I would do anything for that guy. He I see. Because I'm a good technician. I understand what he's looking for. Like, I understand the perfection that he's looking for, even though it might be minuscule and tiny and unattainable. And I will stand behind him and just say, like, I feel so sorry for you.
01:03:52
You can't let that go. I just, you know, you got to let that go. Yeah. He's never to what makes his movies amazing. Yeah.
01:04:00
But I wonder how. Well, I don't know how close you are with him. How does he generally feel about his movies as finished products.
01:04:07
Oh he I mean he should be put in a home at the end of every movie. And honestly, it's why he makes so few films and every time he makes one, he says, I'm never doing again. Never.
01:04:19
I mean, in some ways, like I could really see I could see fingers, whole process all over make. Yeah. I just especially love the filmmaking. I thought the filmmaking was amazing. Yes. And that is an incredible story. And I don't I'm not sure that all the story was told there. Right. Because that the the relationship between Orson Welles and Mankiewicz is so fascinating. What happened afterwards is so fascinating. And I'm not sure they touched on that.
01:04:44
I'm not sure he wanted to.
01:04:45
I can't I'm not sure what he was. I think he was trying to make it Mankiewicz's movie and not Orson Welles movie.
01:04:51
Yeah, maybe. But we'll have some juicy maybe. Maybe, maybe that's what happened. But there. But there is. Just that idea of giving everything, you know, you give everything for the opportunity to make a great work of art.
01:05:07
Yeah, and sometimes it works given blood.
01:05:12
You've given years of your life, right. You'll never get back. You gave up your relationships. You gave up your liver, you gave up everything. And then you hand this child over that you've protected and created. And somebody else is like, oh, let's make it a comedy. Let's put a bow on it. That's, you know, I mean, you can see his, like, injustice. The injustice of it all is great. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:05:40
But at the end of a movie, every time that I see him at the end of having created a film or even when I see him at an award show and he's an award for it, he's traumatized by the experience of having that always traumatized.
01:05:52
Well, I mean, like what you just said is so powerful because you do what you put all that time and effort and sweat and life and love and all of that into it.
01:05:58
And you put it out in the world and some idiot can just go like that is OK, you like you know, without even, you know, really absorbing.
01:06:06
I wish because he is such a genius.
01:06:08
I wish I could just, like, take some of my DNA out of my bloodstream and just like, inject it into him so that he's able to say to his child, like, yeah, you know, I wanted you to be a doctor.
01:06:23
Right.
01:06:24
But this is your life. And I, I did the best I could. But obviously, you like music, right? And you're a great musician. I can't play piano, but, you know, you like it and more power to you. And I'm going, I hope you get that scholarship. And when you do, I'll be standing in the audience going like this, whatever it is you do with your life, even if you work at Petco.
01:06:45
Right. That's kind of the I wish I could I wish I could take that out of my veins and put it into him. But it's not possible.
01:06:51
Oh, it's interesting that you have this like it seems that like through the course of just even this conversation, that there's definitely these guys in your life that you respect, you know, their talent, their hearts. But you but you feel deep connections with them is because you don't have a relationship with your real dad, right?
01:07:10
No, I almost never met him. I only met him a couple of times and I almost never met him ever. Well, I met him on the street a couple of times like a puppy. I met him when he got to when he got yeah. No, no. By accident a couple of times. Two to three times. I met him by accident because I live in L.A. I live like, you know, not far from him. Four times I've met him by accident and then one time I, I organized it.
01:07:33
Yeah.
01:07:34
Well how did you like nineteen when he was ninety now. Yeah. Because my, my kids wanted to meet him. And how did that go.
01:07:41
It was great. He's a really entertaining. Well, he wasn't he died recently. He's an entertaining old dude. You know, he had his wits about him show super sharp and he can spin a lie like nobody's business. Oh, yeah, super entertaining.
01:07:55
But it's interesting that you mention that like that I have these guys that I have this fondness for.
01:07:59
And, you know, I was raised in an industry where there are no women. It was just me. And then sometimes it was the script supervisor and occasionally a makeup artist. But other than that, it was just me and a guy and sometimes the lady that played my mom. But other than that, it was me and a whole bunch of guys in some small town in like, you know, Columbus, Ohio, Columbia, Ohio or wherever.
01:08:20
And they were my brothers, you know, my dads. And they taught me lessons and they taught me how to be a gentleman. And they taught me the right and wrong and how to do the right thing. And, you know, and the directors and other actors that I've worked with, you know, I really like these guys. They're complicated guys that not everybody loves. And I will do anything for them like I am. I'm the sister laughs at their jokes and just loves them.
01:08:48
I just love them.
01:08:49
It seems like you keep, but it's ongoing. It seems like you add new ones every few years, like you're you're still open to for a few new ones to come in, like, like, like Mel Gibson is is a problematic person. Do a lot of people. But you guys seem to genuinely like get each other.
01:09:08
Yes. He is a problematic person and he is warm and affectionate and loving and a really good friend and fascinating and sprightly and and and and childlike. And, you know, he's all those things as well. Good actor, great actor, a great actor and a deep, deep person. I think that's probably what has gotten him into so much trouble. Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah.
01:09:33
Well, it's just that I think that he's a he's a deep, deep person. And the beaver, the character in The Beaver, you know what he brought to that? I will always be grateful. That's a tremendous performance. And that came from his bowels. I mean, that really came from his gut. Yeah. And that was a lot to give. That's a real gift that he gave to me.
01:09:48
Well, I think there is something to be said in terms of your appreciation of what goes into what you do and what the people in your business do.
01:09:58
I because I said I said to my producer when I was thinking about Mel Gibson, I'm like, what?
01:10:03
Did they bury a body together? What is it? How is it like what is the secret that bonds them?
01:10:09
But I think it's it seems to be that your appreciation for what really goes into what we do.
01:10:16
And look, he you know, as I say to my kids, we always laugh about this.
01:10:21
And I say to my kids, I say, look, if you well, I don't actually say this. I say something much worse. But I will say the nice version to you. Yeah. You rob a 7-Eleven. Yeah, I'm going to.
01:10:35
Call the police and take you to jail, but then I'm going to visit you in jail every day, and it's not that, you know, I don't condone necessarily, sure.
01:10:48
People's behaviors that are wrong, but I can't not love my children. I can't not love my family members. Right. And that means that, you know, it's kind of Christian, you know, it's a little Catholic of me. Right. Not that I was raised as a Christian, but it's you don't abandon people in their worst moments of struggling. You extend your hand to try to teach them and to help them be a better human being.
01:11:11
Yeah, it's a tolerance and an empathy that that requires some vigilance for a lot of people, you know, and he's helped me.
01:11:18
He's helped me be a better person, too. Well, that's great. And in terms of acting. Like, I mean, there seem to be points where because like the new movie, the Mauritanian, like there seems to be points like I watch I watch the speech at the Golden Globes where, you know, the not coming out speech.
01:11:35
But there was also but there was also it's so funny because that was framed by the press as a coming out speech that you you couldn't win, you know?
01:11:45
Well, no, no, I won one because they had to close the part where I said even though I knew they were going to do.
01:11:52
Yeah, OK, I won. Good, good, good. But the point was made in the point still holds. And it's the same point in some ways, like a lesson that was probably part of the an extension of the lesson from the events with John Hinckley that, you know, you you protect your private life in your private, you know what, at whatever cost.
01:12:12
So you can have it well, so that I can be a living, surviving person as opposed to a dead person in a hotel room with a syringe in their arm. You know, as as awful as an analogy is, that is I have survived intact.
01:12:33
And I think as a fairly well-adjusted person, even though I'm crazy about certain things like my computer, I've survived intact by coming up with a scuba mask, you know, the lack of a better word know I have a read that allows me to breathe.
01:12:49
Right. And. I those survival, the survival tools are important to in order for somebody to become a whole person, right?
01:13:02
Yeah, and it's hard it can take a long time to become a whole person.
01:13:06
Yeah. I mean, I'm not even sure I'm there yet. Yeah.
01:13:10
I mean, either I feel that all the time, like, you know, am I, am I me. Well, the worst is as you get older, I just start feeling like I start seeing other people that are blowhards or people that are like super selfish and completely self-absorbed and, you know, and I'm just like. I was like that, too. I still like that. That's awful. No, no, you you're able to really be humble and be humbled by your consciousness, right?
01:13:38
Well, you know, what I stopped doing is like, you know, I started embracing the the the phrase. I don't know. I don't know.
01:13:45
Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Like, you know, like if I don't know something, I'm going to say it, you know, as opposed to pretend I know it or, you know, half assed the answer. I'm just like, I don't fucking know.
01:13:56
I, you know, that's good. I'm in it. Yes, but that's that is your B.S..
01:14:01
Oh embrace. I don't know. The humility of embracing. I don't know is the best. Yeah.
01:14:07
I mean Mahamadou story. So you know for the Mauritanian. Yeah. Like that. That's another reason why I was attracted to this is, is really because of who Mahamadou is.
01:14:18
You know, Mahamadou with somebody who and his his part of 9/11 was that he was made to be fearful and was terrorized just like. You know, we we were 11 and what he did with it is that through faith and through love and awareness, he was able to become a better person. And he is forgiving. He is genuinely joyful.
01:14:47
He is a real guy, but he patentee, who appreciates life, thrives in the moment and is kind of childlike and curious about everyone and doesn't have a mean bone in his body. And that could have broken him. That could have turned him in. Oh my God.
01:15:04
Are you kidding? I mean, that was crazy. I mean, I thought that the real footage of him at the end over the credits, thank God they put that in there because I can.
01:15:12
And that's really who he is. Like, he's just goofy, goofy, just delicious, affectionate. But he was in Gitmo for 14 years. Yeah.
01:15:23
But now I guess the question coming at this guy is this is a story about him, but it's also about this lawyer, Nancy Hollander, who like out of nowhere, like I grew up in Albuquerque.
01:15:32
So when all of a sudden we're in Albuquerque, I'm like, oh, my God, how did I not know this person?
01:15:36
But yeah, but it's about her taking on the case of someone who was rounded up in post 9/11 and accused of being one of the masterminds of 9/11 because of some phone calls.
01:15:50
And he was renditioned and then ended up in Guantanamo and and he was tortured.
01:15:57
But what what shook me up was that even after it was conclusive that he probably was not involved, you know, they kept him in there for another seven years. Eight years.
01:16:07
Yeah, well, they knew he wasn't involved. I mean, they they had to have known that he wasn't involved fairly early on because they were never able to corroborate any of these of the assertions and they never charged him. Right. So it was really the habeas case that allowed Nancys habeas case when she took to the judge and said, look, you know, you can't keep people for no reason in a prison without telling them what they're there for.
01:16:31
And the judge said, you're right. And all the evidence that they had against him had been gotten out of torture. Just really one guy that was after seven years of being tortured. Yeah. He had one session of confessions where he admitted to everything, including being pope. Like basically he was just like, whatever.
01:16:50
Right. And when that was thrown out and they said, you can return home, the administration kept him another five years just because and they threw a Democratic administration.
01:17:01
I mean, this was not Obama. Yeah.
01:17:03
So when you decide to do a movie like this, because, I mean, you sort of pick and choose fairly specifically now you can I mean, how do you choose a role outside of the story of him? Was the story of Nancy compelling to you? Oh, I love the character.
01:17:20
You know, this idea. And she's somebody that is a hero to me. You know, she believes that she has this mission, that she is there to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law to uphold. Social justice and civil rights, even though a good portion, if not all of most of our clients are guilty, right.
01:17:40
And she's like, you know, I don't have a problem. I don't care whether she'll say. I mean, I don't know. You know, it's sort of her bravado.
01:17:45
I don't care whether they're right or not guilty. Right. If the government has a case against them, then, you know, let them fight. Let them take their let them go to prison for the rest of their lives. I don't care. But they deserve to be defended.
01:18:00
And how was Kevin McDonald to work with Kevin Donald's?
01:18:03
Amazing. He's so the right guy for this. You know, he has this great documentary, understanding of documentary and facts and incredibly well researched in this sort of beautiful even approach to being able to see all the characters. All the characters have a point of view. But he also is just a great cinema director. You know, I think he he he loves being inside one character and then just looking around and saying, how does that feel? What does that look like?
01:18:27
And that's what really makes him different than a documentarian.
01:18:31
Yeah, he seems like a smart director. I had one of the biggest faux pas of my life was with that guy. Really?
01:18:38
Yeah, because I had him booked on on this show. Right. To interview him. And I thought it was Kevin McDonald from Kids in the Hall.
01:18:45
And I was a God guy and I was like, that's hilarious. I was expecting Kevin McDonald from Kids in the Hall and Kevin McDonald, the film director, showed up. And I had no idea who he was.
01:18:54
And I had to tell him to wait in my house, run out to my computer to figure out if I'd seen anything he'd done so I could not. And I didn't tell him what was happening.
01:19:05
And so I interviewed him for like a half hour, 35 minutes, which was short for me. And then I couldn't put it up until I interviewed the other Kevin McDonald.
01:19:14
And I think I I think I believe I put them up together. And I don't think that the film director, Kevin MacDonald, it thought it was very funny, but it was.
01:19:25
That's hilarious. What was it for? What movie was it for? It was it was for the one. Oh, which one was it? Hold on.
01:19:33
I can tell you because I really thought that, like when I talked to the publicist that showed up at my house. How do you spell him?
01:19:41
Is it M.C. Demasi? Oh, that was the big problem right there.
01:19:45
Yeah. When he when the publicist showed up at my house, I was like, you know, so he's directing now. That's kind of interesting, you know, like, I literally thought that I would still talk. It was crazy, man.
01:19:59
It was so stupid. Hold on and tell you it was with 009. Oh, yeah, it was.
01:20:04
