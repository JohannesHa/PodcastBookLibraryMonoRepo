Lock the gates. All right, let's do this, how are you? What the fuckers, what the fuck buddies, what the fuck? Next, what's happening? I'm Marc Maron. This is my podcast, WTF. Welcome to it. Come on, get in it. Get in the fucking present. Let's do it, let's be here, be here now, whatever it it, whatever, Ebtekar, toet this, this is it. I'm living this second, this second, this second.
00:01:19
I'm in the now. Now I'm not now. It's now. It's true, though, man, hey, all you got at this moment, right, and then the one after it and then the shitty one after that and then like, oh, what about seven moments from now? That's going to be trouble. But to that way of thinking is not correct.
00:01:37
Stay in the moment. Find out what's happening. People, today, I iced tea is on the show today. That was something I was very I made myself very crazy about that, about interviewing iced tea because he's fucking iced tea.
00:01:55
Doesn't seem intimidating to you. Doesn't it seem like when you picture iced tea, like, all right, he's iced tea, but that might be an intense, intimidating guy to talk to.
00:02:05
And I made myself fucking crazy for two days. Listen to the new bodycount record. Some of his other older records dug in a little bit.
00:02:15
Yeah, I was forgotten. Wasn't surprised. I'd forgotten, you know, that there were a couple of icey albums that I listened to the fuck out of.
00:02:24
When I was a younger man, certainly that first bodycount record and then that freedom of speech record, because I was going through this stuff in my guy, not only did I have this record, I listened to it sort of constantly for a while, both of those records.
00:02:40
But I also had this weird experience where I never met him before. But we we shared some space together, iced tea and I back in the 90s. The mid 90s, I think, is like 96, 97, I was on a trip to Spain with my first wife. It was a honeymoon that we'd put off and we were in I think we're in Barcelona, Spain, at an aquarium.
00:03:11
And. I was there with his I guess, his wife and daughter, young young kid, and they were walking through the aquarium in front of me and Kim. And I told the story about this on Conan O'Brien. On December 10th, 1997, so it must have happened shortly before that, you know, within a year or two, I can't track things, but I'll share that.
00:03:40
I'll share my telling of that story about being at the aquarium, walking behind ice tea and his family because I wanted to.
00:03:49
This was that Conan O'Brien appearance. I'm walking behind ice tea and we're going through the exhibits, OK? And for some reason in each tank, he would read the description. All right. I guess the moral of this story once I get into it is that it's not what you say, it's how you say it, because I'd be standing right behind him and I'd be reading he go coastal marsh community.
00:04:08
And I don't know, just the way he said community. I'm looking in the tank for social injustice. You know, it'd be like, oh, the macro keeping the guppies down there, you know? And then and then the next day. The next day. And I'm dying. I think it's the greatest thing in the world. There he goes. Look at that big ass crab. So we know from social injustice through just an observation. He's the guy that I would want to hear narrate, like every weight represents the menu of corned beef and eggs.
00:04:42
Yeah, coastal marsh community.
00:04:45
And I'll bring that up to ice when I talk to him in a few minutes.
00:04:51
So, you know, the bottom line is the point I guess I'm trying to make is that after all my insanity, after all my flailing insecurity and fear, it was great.
00:05:03
It was great to talk to him. He was up for it. And I thoroughly enjoyed it.
00:05:08
And I think he had a nice time, too.
00:05:11
So they had this piece in The New York Times on Saturday, an interview that I did with David Itzkoff, who just wanted to interview me about my relationship with Lynn, and they put that in the paper, I guess what really sort of interest him initially outside of, you know, our creative relationship was me experiencing and going through this grief publicly.
00:05:37
The choice I made and I've just been so, you know, the heavy heartedness about that and the sort of emotional rollercoaster every day, but like, I have been feeling physically ill for months, really.
00:05:49
And every few weeks I think it's covered and every once in a while I feel like it's allergies, but now it's just gotten terrible.
00:05:56
And I'm just every day I'm just queasy and the weight of the fucking world, you know, and it's not so much I mean, I'm fighting depression like everybody else is.
00:06:07
I'm dealing with grief.
00:06:08
But the truth of the matter is, is that, you know, even before Lyn died, I was getting up every morning wondering if my fucking cat was alive or what condition my cat was in. And that's ongoing. You know, this is still going on and it's just draining me. It's killing me. And he's very bad right now.
00:06:27
And I just you know, I know we've covered this before, but it's like it's it's going to happen.
00:06:33
I didn't realize that's probably what's making me so physically outside of, you know, grief, pandemic stress, isolation, sadness, fear. Is that every day, every day I wake up at five thirty six in the morning and wonder if my cat's alive, today is the day every day.
00:06:55
But I will tell you this. I still have had the energy, you know, to to lose my shit at my father. I'm OK with him now, but, you know, I did find time to call my dad a fucking dummy for political views that were shallow and just sort of like his brain is some sort of recording device and it only records when the information connects to some sort of anger. And he's sitting at home, I don't know why.
00:07:30
I don't know. There's nothing I can do to stop it watching not not Fox News, he's watching The Dumber, more propagandistic one, the one America News Network, because he I don't know.
00:07:40
He thinks it's news, but someone's guiding him.
00:07:42
He's surrounded with Republican people and his new family.
00:07:48
And I just washed my shit.
00:07:49
It was and it was my dad was what I thought to be an intelligent guy, you know, a sophisticated guy, but not with politics.
00:07:59
And it turns out maybe not with anything, you know, other than what his focus was, which was medicine at a time. So I thought we could engage around a little bit of a discussion to get get off of, you know, whatever his problems are, whatever my sadness is. And so I asked him as a doctor, you know, what he thought about this pandemic situation and how it's being handled.
00:08:23
He says, well, clearly we've got to we've got to get back at China. And I'm like. What the fuck are you talking about? What about what we're dealing with? Well, I mean, it came from there. What is that? Got lost my shit literally lost my shit.
00:08:42
Call my father a fucking idiot.
00:08:44
And I, you know, and and then I felt bad because, you know, he's old now. When Glenn was alive and when I was more engaged and grounded and enjoying life before the pandemic, before the loss, you know, I had a certain amount of ability to sort of compartmentalize and manage, you know, whatever I'd put on the back burner or let go of, but obviously not totally.
00:09:10
It's hard to let go of everything about your parents.
00:09:14
And, you know, on some level, I should be excited that they're still alive and.
00:09:18
But I don't know. I felt bad about it and I called him, it wasn't quite an apology, I think I said I don't really care whether or not I talk to you at all.
00:09:35
And then he goes, well, I do, and I'm like, all right, well, let's try and figure this out then.
00:09:40
And I said, I just want I just it's when you talk about that stuff in such a shallow way, in such a, you know, an unsourced way.
00:09:51
You know, be one thing, if you had a political point of view, which you don't, because right after I hung up on him and called him a fucking idiot, he Teche left a message.
00:09:59
Look, I don't care. I don't care who who wins.
00:10:02
I don't give a shit. I don't really give a shit. I don't give a shit about Pelosi.
00:10:07
And, you know, this foushee, it's like so he's still reeling off these talking points that have recorded on the anger tape in his brain, but disconnected the things and telling and saying, like, I hope I hope Biden wins.
00:10:20
I don't give a shit.
00:10:22
Biden call them back.
00:10:23
Now, if I'm coming back, I said, look, you know, when you talk like that, it's just it's embarrassing and it makes me lose respect for you because it's it's shallow and dumb. And it makes me angry that I have to sort of relive this embarrassment, this lack of respect, and also to to find out that, you know, maybe in your old age or maybe always, you just are not a sophisticated thinker.
00:10:52
And now, look, I'm more than capable of indulging other opinions. On some level, it's aggravating. It makes me angry. But I mean, if I can see them track it back to, you know, a point of view, but he doesn't have one.
00:11:05
Completely reactive, so I told him that and, you know, he got it, but, you know, we'll see. Maybe I'm too selfish, too, I don't know, but that's my story.
00:11:17
Bill Burr came by the other day sit and talk about the world, about life, about helicopters, about grief, about children.
00:11:27
And. He ate some cake, thank God. You know, Bill is a pretty healthy guy to know is how I was going to go, but he ate the cake, barely ate the cake, and then I sent him the fucking recipe. As nice I hadn't seen Bill in a long time, not since before the pandemic probably, and, you know, it's nice to sit down, catch up. All right, so listen.
00:11:56
We got we got iced tea coming up, his most recent album with Bodycount is called Carnivore. It was released back in March right as the pandemic hit. So he wasn't able to tour with it.
00:12:09
Talk about that a little bit. He also rereleased a new studio edit of their 2017 song, No Lives Matter in support of the anti-racism movement.
00:12:20
And this is me, an iced tea coming up.
00:12:35
Folks, I love Ben and Jerry's, and if you've been listening to me over the years, you probably know that I have my favorites. I have my rituals for eating them.
00:12:42
I even toured the Ben and Jerry's factory. And now there's an entirely new line of Ben and Jerry's for all of us to experience. Ben and Jerry's has three new nondairy frozen desserts that are a brand new twist on vegan euphoria. The Ben and Jerry's flavor gurus have taken a big leap this time. People they made the new non-dairy frozen desserts with sunflower butter, sunflower butter.
00:13:06
They're the perfect, sweet treats for vegans, vegetarians and everyone in between. They've got milk and cookies flavor without any actual milk. There's also creme brulee, cookie and mint chocolate cookie. All right. All plant based, all delicious. We all know that going plant based is smart for a whole lot of reasons. But I get it. It's hard to pull the trigger. That's what makes these Ben and Jerry's flavor so great. You can make that plant based leap while you're treating yourself to some top notch sweets.
00:13:33
My favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor is peanut butter cups. So if they can do a great job with these new flavors, how about we get some non-dairy peanut butter cup in the mix? How about that, huh? Let's do that. Let's do it. Check out the Ben and Jerry's sunflower butter lineup and the whole nondairy family at Ben Jerry's dotcom. That's Benjy R y dotcom. Folks, here's the thing about home security companies. Most trap you with high prices, tricky contracts and lousy customer support.
00:14:02
So while there are a lot of options out there, there's only one no brainer and that is simply safe, simply safes. Got everything you need to protect your home. With none of the drawbacks of traditional home security, it's got an arsenal of sensors and cameras to blanket every room, every window and every door tailored specifically for your home. Professional monitoring keeps watch day and night ready to send police, fire or medical professionals. If there's an emergency, you can set it up yourself in under an hour.
00:14:32
Just peel and stick the sensors exactly where you need them. No technician required. And there's no contract, no pushy sales guys, no hidden fees, no fine print. All this starts at fifteen bucks a month. We're not the only ones who think simply safe is great. U.S. News and World Report named it the best overall home security of twenty twenty head to simply safe dotcom crash WTF and get a free HD camera for WTF listeners. That's simply safe dotcom.
00:15:00
So wtf to make sure they know that our show sent you.
00:15:14
Hey, what's up? Hi, how's it going, man? What's up, boss? How you doing? I'm OK. You you know, I'm I'm probably in the same state.
00:15:23
Everybody else is just chilling at home, chilling at home and terrified. I'm just being careful. Super cautious. Yeah.
00:15:31
Yeah. It gets scary because anything you do, you get home and you're like, oh fuck. What the fuck did I just do?
00:15:40
You go outside for one second, some asshole walks by and you're like, God, God damn it.
00:15:45
Well, you know what it is I got I got like my quarantine team, like the people I'm used to being around, you know, my sister. Right. Those people, I'm comfortable with them. But when someone else enters our zone, I feel like they're an alien. I'm like, I don't know you. I don't know what you've been breathing. What a you've been eating. I don't know what you've been to her.
00:16:07
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I mean like I've been going. Yeah. So you're not going in the store. Nothing.
00:16:14
I tried, I tried to send my wife as much as possible, you know, she's much younger than me. She doesn't mind wearing a mask and doing the whole thing. I, I try to make essential runs, you know. Yeah I do a lot of I do a lot of drive through that, you know, fast foods and stuff. I do a lot of that stuff, but I'm not really trying to be honest. I've had enough people I know close to me die.
00:16:41
And, you know, my my father just got out of the hospital after a month bout with it and.
00:16:49
Oh, my God. Yeah, he was a non master. He's a he's a guy that rides Harley's, shoots guns and wouldn't put on a mask. And it got him it put him on his back. And now he has probably well, he has to be on oxygen now. And definitely it damaged his lungs to where his lungs will operate.
00:17:12
Oh, my God. Yeah. Well, let me ask you a question. Let me ask you a question about a guy like that in the sense that, like, now there's a guy like that. Is he too proud to realize he was fucking stupid or and is he going to like.
00:17:26
Because I see these CATSA, you know, they're they're against Hamas. They say it's a scam and a real and then they get it and then all of a sudden they just shut up where there's a teachable moment there where they can say, you know, I fucked up. This is real, you know, throat.
00:17:40
He totally changed in the hospital. Yeah, that'll do it right. You see, God, he totally changed. He told everybody to wear a mask. He admitted he made a big, huge mistake because when he caught it, not only did he catch it, his son caught it in. His two sisters caught it. And I talked to the I talked to the nurses in the hospital. He was there and they were like, you know, sooner or later they figured out who he was, you know, because we definitely went in there and tried to make you know, at this point when people are getting close to die, you're trying to get every bit of juice you can.
00:18:14
So I'm like, you know, this is my father in law. Next thing you know, he's on the news. I'm like, all right, well, now you're priority patient. You don't they're not going to want to let you die. Right? Right, right. Oh, I'm just trying to save his life. And the nurse, she told me, he said, everybody in here. Ninety percent of these people are nonbelievers until they're here.
00:18:35
So she had most of the people catching it or catching it. Just some negligence.
00:18:41
No kidding. And and you wonder, is that going to change their entire political point of view or just that the one thing around this thing you know? Well, I mean.
00:18:54
I don't really know, you know, I know is that it is a life changing situation, you know, any time you say, hey, this can't happen to me and it happens to you, you got to be a real idiot to kind of try to keep riding it out, you know? So, yeah, there's some were there were three days then they were calling us. With that next of kin call like we want to make sure that we could put him on the ventilator if we need to ride, and Coco was crying and it was it was it was pretty much like he was going to die and he lost he lost like 40 pounds.
00:19:33
He's now real frail. And this is like a big, big, husky dude, you know, like. But that's why I don't have a problem speaking on it, because people look at me, take Barwise Wise to you, a tough guy to stand there. And I'm like, yeah, but this thing and you can be tough against, you know, your gangster can't help you with this, you know. Yes. He wrote me. He said, well, do you say that like you said, you terrified.
00:19:58
You sound scared. I said, well do I'm scared. You'll you'll you're contaminated breath. That's what I'm afraid of. OK, so you want to call me scared? Because I can't put that. I don't. I don't. This is my point with iced tea. I lived through so much shit. Yeah.
00:20:18
I can't let this thing kill me. You know what? All I gotta do is stay in the house and be where. And one of my boys who just came back from the penitentiary, he did twenty six years named Spike. So I'm talking to him. I'm like, dude, how you doing on quarantine. He goes, quarantine eyes. I was in the hole for two years. Yeah, in a hole.
00:20:41
He said, I got my wife here, I got Netflix. I got mad. You had to get some perspective. Yeah.
00:20:49
He doesn't have to go anywhere. He knows how to do not go anywhere. Exactly.
00:20:53
He says you better sit your ass down. So I, I take, I take heed.
00:20:59
Well I think also it's this thing about being healthy or not being healthy is I don't think anybody really knows what they're made of inside genetically or whatever. You could be healthy as shit. And if your blood's a little fucked up, you got a little something in your heart. You don't know what this virus is going to hook up to and kill you.
00:21:15
How it's going to do it, you might not know you have any type of a right thing. You know, thing. My friend Scarface, who's a singer from Geto Boys, he's healthy. It took him down. He said, I felt like I had three hundred pound weights on my chest and I coughed so much I felt like I was coughing razorblades.
00:21:37
Oh, my God. And it destroyed his kidney. He's on dialysis now. Oh my God. Younger carries. And if I, you know, late 40s, 50s, a dude on and order that I work with. Daley died right out the gate. He was forty five years old, Dominican cat. You know, people are just stupid. I think more people who start masking as more people know somebody personally.
00:22:03
Exactly. Yeah. Every no one's going to be untouched by this thing. They're going to know a guy whose dad or his brother or uncle or their grandfather, whatever. Everyone's going to know somebody that went down. It's terrible.
00:22:17
You know what I tell people and people ask me because, you know, I've been trying to been the voice of reason for. So, yeah, I tell people like this where no matter what, no matter your conspiracy theories, you're five g where it came from, who made it, why it's here. Mind control, new world order, all that Illuminati.
00:22:41
Illuminati.
00:22:42
Yeah, IRS itself is real. OK, now, I don't care where it came from, I don't care all but the virus itself is real. So fucking around with it if you want to. Right. But it's an asset. We'll have years to figure out where it came from. Is it, is it a Foxe and Bill Gates conspiracy? I don't know.
00:23:09
That does happen again. I'm going to I'm going to go no on that one. No, I don't hear my my thing is I was in the military. Right. Yeah. People start shooting. The first thing you do is you take cover, then you figure out where they're shooting from, right?
00:23:28
So right now we're in a take cover moment, you know, and also like speaking of that before, well, there's a couple of things. The new album's great. I like I like the record. I like that song. Point the Finger. Right.
00:23:41
I mean, because it's interesting to listen to the the nature of how you present issues has evolved. And, you know, even when you're talking angry, there's a little more there's a little more balance and maturity in it. Do you know what I mean? Even on the song, like, you know, when I'm gone, it seems like an angry song, but you're basically saying, love me now while I'm here. Yeah. Yeah.
00:24:06
Well, that that happened after I watched Nipsy die, another young L.A. rapper who actually basically kind of lived my life. He went to the same high school I went to. He came from the same neighborhood, you know, and he's the new generation. And when he died, they sold out the Staples Center in two hours for his memorial service. Yeah, I'm like, but what? He sold it out two hours for a concert live? No.
00:24:36
So what with what are y'all doing? Like, why do you have to die for everybody to show up for you, you know, in. Yeah, yeah. You know, and Amy Lee came in on that song and killed it. I had no idea how Vince got Amy to do that song. I'm my bass player. Had to connect and goes, look who I got on this song. I'm like, that's not the Evanescence chick.
00:25:00
And he's like, yeah, I'm like, oh, and she killed it because it sounded great. She said she it went through somebody passing too early in her world. Yeah. And so, you know, even though we're two different people, we're both singing from the heart in this song and that's why it makes it work.
00:25:20
Yeah. You know, it's got a lot of weight to it in terms of the rhythm and the nature of just, you know, metal in general. But but there's a lot of heart and sensitivity to the lyrics themselves.
00:25:33
Beautiful. It's difficult to do.
00:25:38
Sincere songs when you're not sincere.
00:25:41
You know, so if something happens to you like one of your boys dies or something, you know, I could write a heavy song about this virus right now because I've been through it, you know, but that's where they say some of the best art comes from pain, so.
00:26:00
Well, yeah, that's that's the that's the idea. And then you get people that are like, well, maybe I don't get enough pain in my life. And then they start to hurt themselves.
00:26:07
And then, you know, you got to be counted to yeah, I haven't gone down that road like I'm self inflicted a no no.
00:26:16
You don't need to hear. I got a funny story for you because I actually we never met. But I told the story about you on Conan O'Brien. I'm a comedian, you know, so I did I was on Conan back in December of 97. All right. And the story was I was in Barcelona, Spain, on a honeymoon and at some point must have been earlier that year.
00:26:41
And we went to the aquarium and this woman and you were at the aquarium in Barcelona, Spain, with one of the kids and a wife.
00:26:51
And you were just looking at the fish you met. Does this make sense? You remember doing it makes absolute sense. So I'm walking behind you because you're reading off the you know, the information cards and you're reacting to what's in the tank. And I was like, we got to follow this guy because this is the best tour I've ever been on.
00:27:12
You know what, though, when you travel. I was probably on tour. Yeah, I'm never going to any foreign country just to hang out.
00:27:22
Yeah, I've always gone because I was on tour or something. And if you don't take advantage of that trip and go see some sights, you know what I'm saying?
00:27:31
Yeah. So I was in I'll tell you another funny story. I was in Ireland. I love Ireland, Ireland love. And I liked it.
00:27:42
It was cool. I like every place I go because every place I go, I got a fan base. So I go from the hotel to people that love me. So I don't I go right to the hotel, to a group of people that can't wait to see me.
00:27:57
Yeah, I'm always going to love, like, feel like I was fucked up there. I'm like, I'm not even there long enough to know.
00:28:02
I'm, I'm just there for the love and then I'm out. I'm out. So we went to a zoo. Yeah. And a fucking gorilla almost tried to kill me. Right. Like we were we were me and Ernie. See, we're looking at this gorilla and it was big plexiglass thing. Yeah, well it was maybe fake 40 feet away and it took one look at me. I might have been the first black person it saw and it beat his chest and it came and it rushed and it tried to hit the glass.
00:28:31
Bam! I'm like, oh my God, that glass wasn't there. That will help me. I almost died by gorilla entirely.
00:28:42
There's definitely not a lot of black people in Ireland that I noticed.
00:28:46
Yeah, well, you know what I mean. Everywhere you go, everybody, you know, you're not there long enough to understand the politics. You're not there long enough to understand the bad stuff. Sure. And I never go to other countries and speak on their particular politics. That's a suck a move to talk about them and and get on a plane and leave. So I relate to our politics and they usually can find the parallels. What's going on in their country?
00:29:15
Well, that's that's smart because like, yeah, as soon as you just even if you make a comment because you observe something without really knowing much about it, because you're an American, you're they're going to they're going to drag you through the press because you're the American. They came in and made a comment.
00:29:31
I did not know how serious the IRA was. I didn't I heard of it. So I'm over there and I make a comment about the IRA. And a guy goes to say that. I don't say that. You can't say that they'll arrest you like the IRA is a terrorist like situation. Like he goes, you don't know who the IRA is. It could be me. It could be the guy next to you. I'm like, let me just shut the fuck up before I don't even, you know, like you say, I'm not as educated.
00:30:04
About another place we went, we went to Spain. Yeah, and do you know what the Basque Country is? Yeah, yeah, sure.
00:30:13
Yeah. That's a whole different type of people up there. San Sebastian. Yes. That whole region. The Basque region. Yeah.
00:30:19
So we did a we booked the show and we didn't know we booked it with them and we got off the airport and these dudes were like covered up. And these dudes were like, you know, OK, looking around and stuff. We jumped in the truck. We're on some off road shit and we end up out in the woods and stuff like that. And they're like, I'm like, where's the promoter? They're like, oh, he got arrested last week, like, yo, who are you guys?
00:30:48
And so we get on the stage, it's like this big tent and we're playing and they go, don't say Spain. I'm like, well, I'm in Spain. No, you're not in Spain right now. Oh, shit. Like, so I've been I've been in some interests.
00:31:04
Yeah.
00:31:05
Yeah. And you and you don't know what you're getting into sometimes. So you get there. No one's briefing you. It's not like you travel with a with an adviser. You know, they're going to give you the layout of the politics of the place. Yeah.
00:31:16
Yeah. You're going behind the lines and stuff but they treat it as good. So we had a good time and then they dropped us off about a block away from the airport, said, OK, you're on your own, make a run for it.
00:31:31
It's funny because I just I was going through my shit.
00:31:33
I was I'm trying to set up my office and I actually found a copy of that that iceberg slim book, the pimp book.
00:31:41
And I gave it to I lent it to somebody and I was thinking about it. And I was looking at I was reading up on your stuff. And it's, you know, that book I don't remember when I bought it, they had reissued the book. But why did that book have such an impact on you and some other rappers that iceberg slim?
00:31:57
Well, I actually named myself after icebergs. Sure, it's part of iced tea comes from ice. When I was in high school, the coolest kids in the school were reading Iceberg Slim's and Donald Goerens books. Yeah, those crime novels. Right. And they used to carry them in their pockets in the back of their five or one georgine's. A paperback could fit right in that pocket and it's almost a part of their dress code. They would wear the same watch.
00:32:26
What are these books these players are carrying? Yes, I got into it. I don't know what it's like to read an iceberg slim book is almost like reading music because of the lingo, right? If anyone's ever read it the way they talk and the way it flowed, it wasn't like reading a normal novel. It had so much. And then me being in the hood, knowing about the Cadillacs, the pimps and the players and the hustlers.
00:32:55
I'm right back in Jersey where I was in L.A. at the time. Oh, OK. So we have this dude. He's talking about a captain named Abel, took us to the table. An hour was spent over crème de menthe. You know, I ate hummingbird hearts and other rare parts. I'm like, who talks like this?
00:33:13
You know what I'm saying? I'm like the coolest motherfucker.
00:33:17
But the thing about Iceberg Slim looks to me is he didn't just show the glamour of the game. He showed the pain. He was a drug addict. He was on heroin. Yeah. Mother and. I initially. Wanted to live that life, you know, I want to be a pimp, I wanted to be in the streets hustling. But then one day I had an epiphany and I'm like, wait a minute. This dude's a writer, right?
00:33:45
Like, he's not just living the life he wrote it. So if I want to really if I like modeling my life after this guy, I can't just live the game. I have to document the game. And that's when my rap career took off because I didn't feel I could write books. I see records or more like iceberg slim novels than hip hop music. Like it's not about dancing. It's not about it's all about me breaking the game down or breaking the life down.
00:34:14
So when I was in high school, I would go to school quoting Iceberg Slim. Yeah. And the girls would say, my name is Tracy. So that being a girl's name in the hood, you know, when you're in a hood named Tracy, they go, that's a bitch name. So now you in a fight with a dude you just met. So they used to call me Trey Quinn, Crazy Trey. And then I didn't say somewhere that iceberg stuff t yeah.
00:34:41
Turns into ice tea. So ice tea has nothing to do with the drink. It means ice for tea. Right.
00:34:48
Well that's that's a really interesting idea that, you know, to know the difference at that age, that you know what is, because I think that's at the core of of a lot of stuff that that's that's happened is that you were savvy enough or sensitive enough to know, like where he lived the life, but he also created this art.
00:35:06
What I like about this guy is his language is the way he puts things together, his ideas, his expression. Right. He lived that life. But most of the time, you don't survive that life. Right. So if you're just going to live the life because this guy made it look so damn good, you know, the chances of you dying without saying nothing are high. But but to know that, you know, what he really did was he was an artist and that's what he that's what he did.
00:35:32
The separation.
00:35:33
We actually did a documentary on him. And I see documentary did on icebergs, portrait of a Pimp, Portrait of a pimp, yet so if you watch that, if you if you have any interest in watch it, you're going to find out. His wife wrote the books. Oh, really? His wife wrote the books because he had got out of the game and he would come home and tell these mad stories about pimping and stuff. And his wife was like.
00:36:05
That's outrageous, and so she got a pen out and he would just tell her the story and she pinned most of the books. So it's very amazing. You know, it's the documentary's deep.
00:36:19
Did she do the rhyming? No, no.
00:36:21
He actually has an album out, OK, where Henry Rollins, we released it and he's actually rhyming over tracks on it. It's like rap. It's rap. He's saying all they call him Hustler toasts.
00:36:36
And then Dolemite was sort of a rap guy, too, in a way. I met Dolemite. I met Blowfly. Yeah. You know, I met I was fortunate enough to meet Red Fox. You see, when I grew up, my parents had these these last records, party records, party records. Yeah.
00:36:57
Roy and Skillet on them. And it was always some woman with a titties out on the front cover. Yeah. And it was the wildest. You know, rowdy talking. Yeah, that would ever hurt, so when we came in, I started doing rap and I was a little profane. People were like, oh, you're just I'm like, you know, this is part of my culture. I grew up listening to this type of shit. Yeah.
00:37:21
So, you know, what I did wasn't anything new might be new to you.
00:37:27
Oh, that's interesting. So you were like when you got criticized for being dirty at the beginning, you like if you listen to red foxes you got to wash your ass because that was the beginning of it.
00:37:39
Can I tell a Red Fox story? Yeah, please. I was with Red Fox the night before he died. No shit. We were we were both on The Arsenio Hall Show. And the first time I ever met Red Fox, I was super huge fan of them. And so he goes out there in our senior awards show and and Arsenio says, Red, you have one of the most blue shows in Vegas. And he said, but you've never been bleeped on television.
00:38:10
How's that? Red Fox says, Because I know that when I'm playing, I know the audience I'm playing into. If I'm in Vegas, I know what to do. If I'm on television, I know what to do. And by the way, who I am hoes in the green room.
00:38:25
And I was in the green room and all the ladies like like Red Fox and meth, I was like, yeah, that's so funny because I'm like, well, but you a big fan from when you were a kid.
00:38:38
It's exciting when you meet people that you love, when you're a kid, when you're grown up, you know, you get that opportunity.
00:38:43
Well, you know, that whole Dolemite scene, Dolemite and them created a thing where they would play those records at parties, like people would be drinking. And here's this. These people on the records talking to my father and them would have those parties and those records be playing signified monkey jumped up. And, you know, it's like. It's just part of my history, sure, but initially, because I was listening like this, it's very interesting to me that you didn't get into your first music really in terms of what you liked was the metal music.
00:39:18
Well, the first music I was really heavily indoctrinated with what happened was I hadn't started rapping yet. But I lived my mother father passed early and I moved to Los Angeles to live with my aunt and my aunt had a son named Earl who was just graduated high school he thought was Jimi Hendrix. All right. He would walk around the house playing air guitar, couldn't play a fucking instrument, head scarves tied around his knees and stuff. And he kept the radio station tuned to Carl Lewis and Kemet.
00:39:55
Right. I couldn't touch the radio station because I was like 15 years old. So what happens is you start to learn metal or rock, right? Because I tell people if you work at a Jamaican restaurant, you may not know reggae, but by weekend you'll be able to pick out the songs you like and before you know it, you know.
00:40:17
So before I know what I'm listening to traffic. Moftah Who Will Jagels Bad Edgar Winter, Boston, L.O. And I started to like the heaviest stuff like Blue Eyes to. Yeah, of course, Black Sabbath, you know, Deep Purple.
00:40:35
So I'm like. So now I go out and I bought the first Black Sabbath album, you know. Yeah.
00:40:43
And I would play it over and over and over again. And people say, well, that's the invention of heavy metal would be sad. Yeah. So I was right there and I knew a lot about it now. And now I'm going to high school with kids listening to James Brown, Parliament, BTE Express, Brass Construction, you know, all those kinds of groups. Yeah. So but I know Rob, right, Funkadelic had lead guitar, put it together.
00:41:16
Yeah. So I was a little bit advanced on it and stuff. And when I finally got a chance to do my first rap album, the title cut was Rhim Pays. And I use war pigs as the hook here and, you know, and also even earlier in the song, you don't quit. I had guitar hits, you know, so I understood that it messed if it was done right. Yeah. When I did bodycount, people were like, oh, you're just jumping on his bandwagon rock.
00:41:47
I'm like not been a rock fan for four years. You know, we could do rock trivia.
00:41:52
I probably beat you, but but it's also interesting that first bodycount record, I don't know. I can't I don't know what year that 1992.
00:41:59
But it was like that was like there was the spirit of like rap, gangsta rap and heavy metal and punk rock, like this stuff that maybe Rollins was doing, black flag and then Rollins banned it all kind of goes together in the kind of fuck you mode of, you know, we're you know, we got something to say. And you guys are full of shit. Absolutely.
00:42:19
And see, when we would go, we were bodycount was created because when we went on tour with Public Enemy, the kids would mass off of the hardcore fast rap like, you know, somewhere in Europe and emancipates jumped up. Yeah. And I'm like, fuck, dad, I can make a rock band right now, you know, because once you've played in front of a mosh pit, you always want to play in front of my face like it's the ultimate crowd experience.
00:42:47
Oh, yeah, it's mosh pit. So I came home and I had a couple of friends pirnie see who they actually played on my first album. But they were kind of like without a country because I'm rock. People were wearing spandex. Oh right. That was a tough time.
00:43:08
Yeah. For some kids from the hood. Yeah. The only group that was really kind of breaking that was anthrax. Right. You know, and suicidal. And like you say, some of the punk bands in New York Hardcore were not wearing it, but we were like, how do we fit in? So I said, well, look. Will use the speed of slayer. We'll use, you know, the impending doom of Black Sabbath and we'll use the punk sensibilities of suicidal and we'll sing about our shit, we won't sing about the devil or dragons or shit like that.
00:43:46
The metal guy's just singing about, you know, I always said if you took a young white kid and said, draw something hard for your notebook. Yeah, they probably draw skulls, right? Yeah. A black kid would draw three fifty seven aimed. Get your fucking face. Right. Right. So we'll take the metal dark energy and you take it right from the street like it's all right there. Hell is right outside your door. It's in the parking lot, motherfucker.
00:44:14
You ain't got to end up going off. No flying off some fucking wherewith those fucking castles and shit. No, it's right here, you know.
00:44:22
Yeah. And that was what body count was based on.
00:44:26
And then on for 30 years, I've got that body count with the cop killer written on there. Still, I got I got one of those.
00:44:36
We thought that was OK. People like, oh, we were trying to cross these. I was like, no, because I'm listening to Black Flag. Yeah, black flag. Got a t shirt with a pistol in a cop's mouth. It says, make me come faggot. Like what? I mean, like there's groups called millions of dead cops. Yeah. You know, punk band. But I gonna tell you this. I think the problem with body count was and I always say this is when black people can exchange their rage to white people.
00:45:10
That's a problem. You know, like right now you're watching all these protests and it's not all black people. Yeah. It's white people out there. People don't want that. They want to be able to say, oh, it's just the Jewish people, man. Always just the white people mad. Oh. But when they see unity in an anger, that's scary.
00:45:32
That's scary as fuck to the power structure. Oh, come on.
00:45:35
When Grandma sat on the front line. Yeah.
00:45:38
Watching the shooter with a rubber bullet. They do. Yeah. And people are outraged and they're seeing this. Yeah. So when I was able to yell cop killer and get thousands and millions of white kids to say it, they were like, we got to shut this down. This is a problem right here and went all the way to the fucking president like it was.
00:45:57
You know, it's amazing to me is that you read the story around that record and Dan Quayle and the police unions and everything else, you know, in the boycott of Warner Brothers pending is that that was a big deal. That didn't happen anywhere. You know, now what happens every other fucking day with this asshole. But when it happened with you, it was like a global fucking crisis, almost. Dude, you don't even know.
00:46:20
I was at my house and I dated the guys were playing techno bull video game. Yeah. And one of my homies, Yo Yo, Ice Man on television, the president is on television talking about. So we change the channel. Yeah. And it was Dan Quayle. Yeah. And he's got it. I got it. This is this is this. And he said an iced tea and everybody in the room, all the dudes were like, oh shit.
00:46:52
Oh.
00:46:53
Now with a real president, people don't know what it's like to have a real president, not somebody who tweets all the time, but a real one.
00:47:03
Say your name in anger. Right. It's not a normal thing like for George Bush to come out and say, blah, blah. You're like, oh, yes. The minute the minute the president says your name, the most serious background check of your life happens. Yeah, the NSA, the CIA, DEA, FBI, all of them. Because the second question from the president could be.
00:47:32
What do we know about him? Yeah, yeah, to be like he makes rap records, you know, they want to know your Social Security number, your shoe size. Oh yeah. They he he wants a dossier on you. Yeah. This is a new problem. And when that happens to you, you feel it. You know, I got tax audited twice that year. I had actual people come to the school and talk to my daughter and ask her, you know, was I connected to their military like they wanted to see if I was really a threat?
00:48:05
Like, is the guy that makes cop killer planning anything?
00:48:10
And I'm like, I'm making a record.
00:48:12
You've got ice cream truck parked in front of your house in the middle of winter.
00:48:19
And eventually they realize I just made a record. This is not a political agenda, a movement. It was just a song about someone who snapped really under the same situations we're going through now. What if somebody just got so fed up with police brutality that he went after?
00:48:37
But but but that's the interesting thing. Going back to what you realize about Iceberg Slim, is that, you know, you created a character to document to document a reality, which is the freedom you have under the First Amendment to create art and to say what you want to say. But because you're black and because of systemic racism, they're going to try to make an example out of you, the song, and it becomes a big political effort and it reveals the actual problem.
00:49:09
They manifested exactly what you were talking about, why you were talking about it.
00:49:14
Look, I learned I learned a lesson from that. And I'm on another album. I addressed it. I called it Freedom of Speech. Watch what you say. That's right.
00:49:27
I love that fucking record, man. I listen to that a lot. The the iceberg. Freedom of speech record. The one with Jello Biafra at the beginning. Yes.
00:49:35
And what that means is we Mark, you got the right to say whatever you want. Right. But you have to be prepared for the ramifications. Oh, if I come out and I said something that would be considered anti-gay, which I never say, but if I did, I got to be prepared for the gay movement to step out and say something anti anti Semitic. I have to be prepared to be attacked. So you have the right to say anything.
00:50:02
Right. But also got to be prepared for the Rams. Like you can't go to your wife and say, yeah, maybe I fucked your sister free speech, you know.
00:50:14
Yeah. So I had to learn that. I had to learn that what I do say I have the right to say it, but people also have the right to get angry.
00:50:25
Well, yeah, but. Yeah, but but isn't that different. I mean I understand that too because you know, I do comedy, I got friends, you get themselves into trouble. And this idea that there's censorship is not it's not fundamentally true because of what you said. You can say whatever you want. You might have to answer for it. But but the problem with the cop killer was that that was the feds coming down. So, you know, that's the government basically implying that you don't have the right to say this because you're starting shit.
00:50:52
We're going to take you down. And that's different because that's. You're right. Right. That's the fucking government being you know, we're going to shut this fucker down.
00:51:01
Well, the gangsters, the gangsters, what they'll do is they'll make it difficult for you. They'll make it uncomfortable for everyone around you. They won't legally be able they couldn't legally put me in jail, but they'll they'll do stuff like what happened during the whole thing. Like cops wouldn't want to do security. We had to get insurance for different shows. We couldn't get insurance. People did. They made us. They vilified us and made us taboo to deal with.
00:51:30
Right. You're going to deal with them then? We're not going to deal with you. So they played it all the way out. And people always say, hey, controversy is a way to be successful. I'm like, not really. Controversy might get you known. But it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to take that to the bank and it's going to be a big thing. It could it can ruin you here for the rest of your fucking life.
00:51:54
Yeah, you could either be like, oh, that guy's amazing. Or like that asshole could go either way.
00:52:00
And so my advice is always, you know, if you're going to Ice Cube, ask me one time he said Ice. You got any advice?
00:52:10
Did he say, like, where I might that something like that.
00:52:13
We've been we've been we've been friends forever. And I just said. Only satiates you can back up if you're going to say something, back it up, if you're going to call a woman a bitch and they come back at you, explain why she's a bitch. Like, I'm not talking about your mother. I'm not talking about this.
00:52:32
I'm talking about you because you are big and then break it down. In other words, don't say stuff. You're going to have to back up. Off. You know, I've always been very calculated with my opinions and my points, and I never wanted to say something that I was going to have to go back and apologize for. I try to think before I speak. And I'm sure I've made mistakes, but is there a song on this record where you're like, I'm not going to apologize for anything which with no remorse or, you know.
00:53:02
Right. Right. Yeah, yeah.
00:53:04
That's a song about somebody who's just been pushed to the fuckin limit. And now it's time for them to take revenge. And there is no remorse because you pushed me to this point where it's going to be the best day of my life, taking out revenge on you, you know, and I'm very against people that say they're not into revenge. I've never got it. They don't know that great feeling.
00:53:28
Oh, my God. It's wonderful. I don't I don't believe in harping on these people. Oh, well, it takes part of your soul, you know? Yeah. I'm like, no, I'm not sitting around lingering thinking about revenge like that. But if it becomes the opportunity. Right, if it rises. Yeah. I'm going to take you. Yeah.
00:53:45
Yeah. You want to you don't want to hurt somebody too much but enough to know that they got hurt a little.
00:53:52
Yeah. So now when you when you think about what's going on now generationally, like, you know, the, the point, the finger song on the new record speaks directly to blaming the victim, which is a real thing. And then on the last record that No Lives Matter song, you know, speaks directly to how the dominating paradigm sort of minimizes the voices of minorities in general.
00:54:17
So when you see what's happening now, like you just said, you're seeing these protests that are multiethnic, multi age, multiclass. Do you feel that that something has changed all of a sudden?
00:54:30
Because like in my recollection, when your generation was coming up and you guys were fighting the good fight, you was usually in reaction to to the same shit that was going on now and then like there were it was different to in the sense that there were really fucking profound, horrible riots in Los Angeles.
00:54:48
But like these kids now, they weren't alive for that. Do you feel like there that this is a wake up call for this generation?
00:54:54
Well. I think I think I let's let's start let's start with this is another generation. This is not even the millennials. These are like the Zeze, even younger. And I went out into some of the uprisings, the riots I was in, actually in Arizona and a restaurant. And they're like, the riot is coming, like like, you know, you hear the people come in and the people inside the restaurant start to panic and I'm like, I'm going outside.
00:55:25
I want to I want to see what's going on. It was all kids. Yeah. All like young kids. Eighteen to twenty five white kids. Yeah. And they were out there doing civil disobedience, breaking up shit while some guys were out there talking to chicks. It's a lot of wildness that was going on, but. I think that right now these kids are growing up. All right, let's look at it like this. Yeah, I think Obama.
00:55:55
Had everybody relaxed, Obama as a president made us all feel everything's cool, you know? Oh, by the way, you know, we got a bin Laden, you know, it's all good.
00:56:07
And and everybody just kind of like relaxed. And that whole generation just was not really into protesting. It was just like. It looks like our commander in chief has us together now, there'll be people that say, well, the world was falling apart, but for the masses, it was seem peaceful.
00:56:26
Well, then so they thought that they that some problems had been solved. Right. Right. Yeah. Tomkinson And he's like panic, like everyone panic, you know, build a wall. We're all going to die this day. And the third and that this generation is growing up in this, you know, four years it is they're like, what the fuck. You know, this is from eighteen to twenty two. They're watching this. I think that right now what we're going through is another civil rights movement, right?
00:56:54
My father marched in the civil rights movements in the 60s. Civil rights is racism, sexism. It's all the different civil rights. Right. People have to address it. You know, the cops, we have to address all these different things. And I'm so happy to see the kids really going out there making some moves you get from these movements. You've got new leaders that come out, you know, young girls, young guys that have become the next generation of leaders.
00:57:25
So activism is great. Activism is good. Now, people got to make, oh, riots and of that. And I'm like, look, a riot is a tantrum and it's a flash point and shit happens during a riot. The best way to stop a riot is never let it get started. You know, now people like, oh, well, you're agreeing with people breaking. Should I say, let me break it down. Let me give you this analogy.
00:57:50
Your wife walks in to you and says she has a problem, you're playing video games. You know, she's telling you about police brutality. She comes back in another time. Hey, baby, let me talk to you about this. You know what I'm saying? I'm too busy. Not the fourth time she throws a fucking shoe to your TV set. That's right. That's right. It's like we tried to take a knee. We're going to burn up some shit.
00:58:17
Yeah, we're going to cause chaos to get attention in way. Right. And now that it's over, you know, no looting, but that's a flash point of a riot. Don't riots happen?
00:58:32
And it just seems to me like for me and what do I know? But it does seem to me that because of this president, because of the sort of shameless, you know, prideful engagement with racists and creating division that, you know, even people of my generation, I think, are finally waking up and seeing the reality of systemic racism.
00:58:57
I don't think they ever really saw it before, even the progressive people. Then the thing about to see, like I told people, I'm not a Democrat, I'm not a Republican, I believe both things are on the same bird. I just look at people in general and make a decision on this. This a good person. Is this guy trying to look out for us? I don't I don't get into all that left wing right wing shit. I don't know.
00:59:21
I'm probably liberal on some things. I don't know what I am. I just try to be honest to myself. Some people don't understand racism when you start saying, oh, we got to build a wall and the Mexicans are the problem. That's racism. Like, you can't just lump a whole country into anything like that and you can't really do blacks right now. So let's do Mexicans and you're triggering the same people. You're triggering all these people.
00:59:50
Chris Rock said it best. He says that our presidency is like a pendulum and it swings from one side. So it went from Bush, you know, over to to Clinton. Right. Who's smoking weed? Then it goes from Clinton to son of a Bush right back over this way. Then it goes from Bush back to Obama and then it went from Obama. Now it's swung this way to fucking Trump. Yeah. He said the only place left for it to swing is Jesus.
01:00:21
You know, like and and when and because you have a two party system, when one party wins, the other party festers and hates and just waits for their chance. And I mean, I don't know, man, in a way we're in our worst time. But I feel like this is a chance for the America, the United States of America to reset and get their shit together for the next hundred years. Like Hope. Yeah, let's get this dialogue going and let's make some changes for the better, because I believe I'm not totally.
01:01:03
Pessimistic, I know too many great people, I know too many good people, so you can't tell me everybody's a piece of shit, I know for sure.
01:01:12
Now, when you were like when Trump was just, you know, a fucking clown, did you ever meet him or do a show with him or anything?
01:01:19
We'll see. Trump is a very opportunist to do like he'll hang out with you if it leverages. So the closest thing I ever came to Trump, I. I walked by him once at the Indianapolis 500. I don't know if I touched him or shook his hand. He just passed by me. He goes to Donald Trump. I'm not fascinated with wealthy people, I've met really wealthy people in my life, so I'm like you, my friend, you know, I'd much rather meet Quincy Jones, you know, somebody I just I just never had a real connect to Trump.
01:01:54
But hip hop, we always thought Trump was a baller. You know, we like Trump. Get Trump. You know, there's even a rapper named told Trump, like Trump was a term for making money. Right. You know. Right. Well, we realized what kind of underlying asshole he was. And one time we roasted him. Yes. The roast of Donald Trump. A Comedy Central thing.
01:02:15
Yeah. Yeah. And he was there and I was with Coco and, you know, Coco. She loves taking pictures with celebrities. And I go, Diego Trump and I go, I take a picture with Trump. And she goes, You want a picture with Trump?
01:02:29
I'm like, nah, I'm good.
01:02:34
I'm good. So, you know, it's like you ain't really no celebrity. Dude, I why would we even take pictures with, you know.
01:02:41
But there's something about that dude.
01:02:43
It ain't right because I was on that same I think it was the same episode I told the story about you, you know, seeing you at the aquarium on Conan.
01:02:52
Trump was the guest before me. Right. And Frank, the guy who was the producer over at Conan when I used to do that show all the time. And Trump was in the dressing room and he said to me, he said, you wanted me, Trump. And I had the same reaction you did.
01:03:07
I was like, Yeah, I think so. I don't I don't want to be the one.
01:03:12
Yeah, because like like why why do I want to meet him? That's like, you know, like I they told you a guy was a major developer in Miami. You built a bunch of hotels and his name was Joseph Johnson. Yeah. I want to know. So the only reason you would want to meet him is if you held him in celebrity like you felt he was some. Yeah. Body. And I was like. And the more I got to watch him like one of my friends, I don't want to mention a name.
01:03:42
Yeah, but his father was on The Apprentice. Oh, yeah.
01:03:45
And he got he got off the first round. And I asked him, I said, why did you get off the show? He said, basically that show is watch your heroes kiss Donald Trump's ass. And he said, I'm not going to do it. And I'm like, well, right on. But he said once he got there, he realized that's what it was. It was like all these people, Herschel Walker, all these greats that we admired watching is his ass.
01:04:10
And he was like, I'm not doing that.
01:04:12
I'm already I'm a billionaire, too.
01:04:14
Yeah, that's a good way to read that. That's a good way to see that. Yeah. So the cover of Ace of Spades is great. Did you know Lemmy?
01:04:24
Yeah, I worked with Lemmy. I did a song called Born to Raise Hell With Lemmy.
01:04:30
And, you know, I've been very fortunate to work with a lot of these metal gods, you know, whether it's it's Lemmy or Henry Rollins or Slayer or, you know, Lamb of God, all these different cats. And I respect them and the fact that they're like, yo, I'm a fuckwit tea, that meant a lot to me, you know, because real artists don't just really collab with people. It's very difficult. Dave Mustaine. Yeah.
01:05:00
Did a solo on one of our records. They don't do that. Yeah. I don't I don't I don't even think Slayer has more than two or three to collabs with anybody.
01:05:09
Yeah. So when I got a chance to work with Lemmy, it was an honor and he was just mad cuz he was, he was, he's his original, you know, like you say. Well I see original gangsta that fucking Motorhead is the original Lemmy, you know. Yeah. And I had a good time with him. And on the body count records we try to do tributes to the groups that influenced us. So, you know, on manslaughter, we, we covered suicidal bloodlust.
01:05:39
We covered Slayer, so. I said, let's cover Motorhead and people like where was Motorhead? I'm like Cocula. You know, down and out and those open in downtown Cocula, it sounds like you on a Harley driving down the freeway popular doesn't sound like Slayer, nor Motorhead. Yeah.
01:06:00
So we're like any other band, we take influences. I was just reading the other day that Metallica, Kirk Hammett said, well, I took a lick from an icy power album to do to start the solo on into the Sandman notion. Yeah. And but but it wasn't even my list.
01:06:20
It was a lick I had sampled from heart, from from hard man down, up, down, down, down from magic man dun dun dun dun.
01:06:33
He heard that I have a song called Take It Personal and I just sampled that Bon Bon Temps on an out and out and and then if you listen to.
01:06:46
Enter the sandman when they go dum dum, dum dum. That's how the guitars start. So he says, I heard it on ice.
01:06:54
I said, I like his term.
01:06:56
He said, I got a snake that got all of us.
01:07:02
All musicians are influenced by other musicians. I mean, I know comedians, too. It's like you see something you like, man. I got to figure out do something with that energy or that that that shit is just dope to me. So if it's done right, you know, people won't ever figure it out. Only to only the artist knows.
01:07:22
I took that inspiration for sure. Yeah. Yeah. But it's done wrong.
01:07:26
People like you rip them off.
01:07:27
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now you got you got to figure out like what it is about what's inspiring and you and what do you you know, how do you put your feelings around it. Right.
01:07:38
Exactly.
01:07:38
So like but it's so weird, you know, when I listen to it, I just really listen to some of your earlier the rap records. And it's like everything was it's amazing how stripped down it was, man. You know, like like the evolution of hip hop. I mean, now the layers, the possibilities, the beats, the possibilities of tracks, it's like it's a completely different universe, man.
01:08:00
I mean, when you were doing it. Yeah. It's like one or two samples at drumming and you know, and that was it. Right.
01:08:06
What do you like the rapper is this is the main instrument, you know, and I got that stripped down style from Rick Rubin right now. I would listen to Beastie Boy Records. I was listening to L.L. Cool J Records. Right. And, you know, like Al's early record, I need a beat, insurmountable beat subject of discussion. You're motivated with a it's like the beat test is just there. The the the vocalists is is the machine.
01:08:38
It's all about the vocals. It's kind of like a beat is playing in. The sax player is soloing over it. That's what a flapper is. It's not about I'm not Celine Dion where I need all the music around me and I sing in the midst of it. New hip hop is really production driven. It's a lot more beat. Right. And tracks are so immense and so intense. You really don't care what they're saying right now. It's it's it's beat in a sonically driven like I play my records in a club and then they'll play a new record in a club and I'm like, God damn like that.
01:09:16
It's just so yeah. It's just fucking vibrates. It's it's technology.
01:09:21
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:09:25
It is kind of amazing the depth of sound that happens now like in just. But you don't.
01:09:31
But on the other side of it, when you listen to your stuff or older stuff in general, you don't need all that shit to, to get the message across, you know, vibes.
01:09:40
If you listen to early metal. Yeah. Then oh it's really thin. Some of it. Yeah.
01:09:46
Yeah. You know, you listen to our new stuff, it's so big and it's mixed so differently. Like Will Pudney mixes the body count albums for stadiums and like you listen to it in, it's like damn I hold cards that crunch heavy.
01:10:02
So you know, it's just evolution.
01:10:04
It's why not. You know what I mean. If if that's what. Yeah, because like people get desensitized to, you know, like now you go back to the old stuff and you can be nostalgic about it and enjoy it. But you if you're into the new stuff, you want something that's going to beat your brains in, you know, you want you want the full body experience.
01:10:23
One of the things I think about the old stuff, it was so experimental, like the eight 08 drum kit, the bass that everybody uses now that's now synthesized out this big. Yeah, just a distorted drum that wasn't supposed to be played like that. Right. And we went into the studio and we were always like, let's do something different. Like I remember the first time I set my voice to a lexicons space station, which is a drum, a drum effects module.
01:10:54
Yeah. And they're like, well, that's four drums. I might hear my voice doing. So you got a bunch of rap kids showing up in a studio full of lights. We wanted to use all the lights. We were like, what is that? And that's where all the sampling started to come through. The echoes, the reverbs. Yeah, I'm with Beastie Boys say views in the red or it may sound thin. So they were like penina views and the engineers were like, no, no.
01:11:22
Like, fuck that. We want to do that. Matter of fact, take the tape out, put the tape backwards. And I'm a rapper with a tape backwards and then you get Paul Revere going. Yeah, yeah. So that creativity. Part of hip hop, early hip hop, we got you know, I like I really appreciate that because I was like, man, people were in there trying to figure it out.
01:11:48
Yeah, right. Because you were actual innovators. You're like, let's use that for this. You're not supposed to, but let's do it anyways. And now everything. You just got a guy going like I can do that. Let me just push this, OK? We're good. Go. You know, like you guys, they carry it on their phone.
01:12:02
Exactly. But you guys were creating the language of it, you know, that they eventually just integrated into a button.
01:12:13
There's some people that are going to look at the first Shelby Cobra, and I think that's the greatest car. And it's some people that want that new here, that new Bugaldie, no matter what, no matter what. So there is respect for the originators of this stuff. And there's always going to be love for the newest model that's out. So ain't no hate. There is just one. Yeah.
01:12:35
And how about like so how like are you guys going back to Law and order. You don't know law and order.
01:12:42
It's an interesting zone. What happened with Law and Order was we were filming and they came into my trailer and said, we're not we're done. We're pulling the plug. I had to see you that day. That was in March. Yeah, right.
01:12:57
Yeah. I was supposed to shoot that day to the day they canceled. Yeah.
01:13:01
So I was like. The hell is going on and then we had a show in New York that got canceled. Then we had a show in L.A. that got canceled because Carnival just came out right. And then we had 40 shows in Europe, all got canceled. No, I'm fucking unemployed right now. That was the moment I really realized you make money in front of people like your money is not you know, it got some residuals coming in, but your real bank is being in front of the.
01:13:34
Yeah, yeah. I was like, wow, you've got to go to work. It was a wake up call.
01:13:39
Yeah, well, and because usually if I can't do law and order, I could do Boddicker.
01:13:44
I got two jobs. Right, both of them dead. So from what I understand right now, they want to come back September, October. Right. What they're trying to do is create a safe work environment.
01:13:59
Yeah, of course, NBC Universal, all them.
01:14:04
They have a lot of liability. Yeah. If they bring us back and somebody gets sick and then we say, hey, you put me in an unsafe work environment, that could be a messy lawsuit. Right. Trying to cover theirselves. And I totally understand that. I think we're going to move into the world of the waiver. Oh, yeah. The restaurant. You're going to sign a waiver when you go to the gym, you're going to sign a waiver.
01:14:29
I chartered a jet to get from New Jersey to Arizona. I don't usually fly private, but I needed to get out here. And I was like. OK, come on, come on, come up off of some of that bread, I stopped being a cheapskate who we started and we had to sign waivers that said if we were to catch cold, we couldn't try to take, you know, come after the aircraft.
01:14:55
Right. So. I think that when I go back to work, you're going to have to sign waivers. A lot of them, you still like doing it?
01:15:04
Yeah, yeah, it's good. It's a good bunch of people. It's fun to go to work, Mariska is wonderful. When you're on a show twenty two years, it just runs like a machine, everybody appreciates everybody. Everyone is keeping everybody employed. Everyone is. You know, when I'm not on the screen, the risk is I love my risk. I told Mariska, I said I'm risky. I love my wife.
01:15:31
I love my daughter, but I've made more money with, you know, so I don't mind it. And also as I'm getting older. It's good not to have to be on the road fucking 10 months out of the year. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Now it allows you to have a house go to work every day.
01:15:55
It's a job. Yeah, and I like that. I like the stability of it. Yes.
01:15:59
Are you friends with Pelzer? Man, Beltrame, you like best friend, how's he doing? Where's he in France? He's in and out of France, last time I heard from. He was in Vegas, but that is something Belzer is a motherfucker like I don't know what when I got on the show, they're like, oh, the rapper. The rapper. He'll be the problem. Yeah, smoking weed. Balzar is drinking wine. Dowser is cursed motherfuckers out.
01:16:27
I'm like, I'm the least problem because it is crazy.
01:16:32
And then me and him became close because we really quickly realized that both of us were nightclub performers. Right. So neither of us like early calls. Yeah. Neither of us, you know. And I asked Balzary says ice, you know what I look for in a script like what goes days off.
01:16:55
I love that guy.
01:16:56
I haven't seen him in years. I used to see him over at the Comedy Store. You driving around in that big Elderado.
01:17:02
He had this baby. I mean, I've got so many bells. He told me wild stories about Miles Davis, about I mean, he he's basically been around all the greats. His comedy is unique. I've seen him live. Yeah. He's just a character, one of a kind of face, you know that.
01:17:22
I know. Yeah. He was the guy in the shootout. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, he's he's a great guy, but he's doing OK. Yeah I hope so.
01:17:31
I hope so. I haven't. I now have to check on him since you brought his name. Yeah please do. Because I don't think I got it. I don't think I got a number for him. Yeah. Bills are like a sweet guy and he's like he's the he's the whole history of modern comedy in that guy. And yeah.
01:17:45
And he like he you know, he really seemed to be learning how to enjoy his life, which is nice.
01:17:50
You know, that was there was I mean working with him for all those years. Yeah. I didn't never know when it was a joke. I didn't know what the fuck was coming. I remember one time he came, came into work, he got ice. I wanna put your dick on the table. Right. I want to show you some right quick. Fuck.
01:18:10
Yeah, but she almost did it right. Like, yo dude, I had learned the lesson. I learned so much about comedy like that. I'm like, oh, that's that's a joke. What a setup is. All right.
01:18:24
That's it was great talking to you, buddy. Hey, thanks for having me.
01:18:30
Hopefully the people and your listeners don't hate my guts and fuck with me. But, yeah, you know, no one's going to hate you.
01:18:38
There's no reason to hate you that the new record is good and you got a lot of respect. Everybody loves you guys. That's what's up. Well, thanks, Mark. Thanks for having me. Yeah, man, take it easy.
01:18:46
All right. Piece. Iced tea and me, what a great talk. What a great guy you can get body counts, Carnivore wherever you buy or listen to music and the single from 2017 that he rereleased is called No Lives Matter. That's around, too. So now I'll play some guitar, I guess. Right. That's what we do here.
01:19:13
