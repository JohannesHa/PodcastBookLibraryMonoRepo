00:00:00
Lock the gate. All right, let's do this, how are you? What the fuckers, what the fuck buddies, what the fuck next? What the fuck? STRs, what the fuck else? How's it going? I'm Marc Maron. This is my podcast, WTF. Welcome to it. Today is Thursday. If you're downloading and listening on the day it comes out, today is New Year's Eve. Tomorrow, Friday, the beginning of a new year.
00:00:39
It doesn't feel like. It usually does, does it? Yeah, I don't know, you know, I spent a few hours today, a little time yesterday trying to figure out, you know, what to say.
00:00:57
Do I have a list? Is there a a top 10 of 20, 20? Is there a countdown of bullshit this? Fuck that that this or that. What's trending now, what are my thoughts on? What are my likes and dislikes? Twenty, twenty, what do we do with it? I think for a lot of us. There's no reason to. Necessarily get involved with the pop culture. Rationalization or distraction or relief attempts. At contextualising this last year on an entertainment level, on a recipe level, on a pop culture level at all, is there really I mean, a lot of it helped us get by, but of it seems like a blur, like a smear, like a haze.
00:01:59
I'm exhausted. I'm exhausted from 20, 20, I mean, I've never felt like I feel now for a lot of different reasons, and I assume many of us have had probably the worst year of our life. My body and brain is exhausted from distributing cortisol. I'm worn out and a thyroid level. From four years of the. Pig king, chaos, master, and everything that came along with that, I'm exhausted. From almost a year of.
00:02:34
covid and belligerent irresponsibility on behalf of so many people, childishness. I'm exhausted by the fact that now, after four years and a plague, I know exactly who my fellow Americans are and what many of them are made of. I'm exhausted because. I know who I am more clearly now. Because of. Grief, covid. Isolation Trump. Panic wildfires. It's been a fucked up year, man. I mean, I know tangibly what happened to me, I know that I had to put two cats down.
00:03:26
This year, I know. That's someone I loved a lot. Basically died in my house. I mean, I know those things happened, I know. The plague came. I know how it was handled from the top down from my neighbor down from across the street down. And I know all of us have had a difficult time. And I want to feel. Optimistic. I want to feel hopeful. I want to take this opportunity like we do every year to lie to ourselves, that this next one is going to be a good one.
00:04:16
I don't know about you, but you know what, I'm hoping for some fuckin relief. Just a little relief would be great. Sure, we got a little relief in early November. But I mean, tangible. You know, walk outside, look around, kind of relief. That's my hope for New Year. I'm sorry you've all gone through what you're going through and what you've went through this year. I am. My empathy can only reach so much, but I do get a sense that some people had a much worse time than me.
00:04:56
A lot of people still having a bad time. I'm grateful that I have some things in place that enable me not to lose my mind or wallow in a sadness that could have proven. You know, chronic. Disastrous. I'm grateful for my friends. I'm grateful for the audience and grateful the people who reached out to me during this last year. I've said this before, I don't know, I guess I'll say it again, I have a lot to be grateful for and a lot to be sad about.
00:05:32
And not unlike anybody else. A lot to be afraid of and we move forward. I want you to have a better new year. I'd love it if you had a happy one, but I don't know what you're hoping for. But I'm hoping for relief. Just a little bit of relief would be. So welcome. Just a little bit of. OK, OK. OK. It's going to be OK. That's my hope. For this new year, for some relief.
00:06:13
And that it's going to be OK, not great. Not even necessarily better. I just want some relief and I want things to be OK, and I'd like us to be able to see past right now again a little bit with a little bit of. Excitement. Hope. I don't know, man, that's a stretch. A lot of things have been laid bare, but my hope for us all is that if you can find some gratitude, find it.
00:06:45
If you can find some. Way to frame the last year positively, maybe because of what you now know about yourself, about your family, the connections you made, the love that you found, how you took care of people, how you took care of yourself, how people took care of you, you can find it could be grateful for that.
00:07:05
I hope for a little relief for us all, a little relief. And maybe just occasionally, the ability to go back tomorrow is going to be OK, tomorrow is going to be good. I can't wait till tomorrow.
00:07:20
So today on the show, David Ritz, I talked to David Ritz, now David Ritz is one of the most prolific biographers of music industry stars. He's the guy he wrote biographies on, Marvin Gaye, Jimmy Scott, Aretha Franklin. He's co-written a ghostwritten biographies for dozens more Ray Charles, B.B. King, Etta James, Janet Jackson, Buddy Guy, Don Rickles.
00:07:43
He co-wrote the autobiography of Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler, which is how I got hooked up with him when I played Wexler in the movie Respect. He's also written his own interesting autobiography called The God Groove A Booze Journey to Faith. This is not your average Jewish guy story.
00:08:02
I just found him to be an interesting guy who's been through some interesting things, and he's made a lot of amazing people and he's gone through a journey of his own. And I thought I would talk to him, since you're a listener of podcasts, you've probably heard of Audible. Obviously we've had Audible as a sponsor for more than ten years.

So. Talking to David Ritz is a bit of a musical history. And he definitely has some insight through all his experience into some of the great artists of our times, you can find links to all of his work at Ritts. All right. Z writes Dotcom Rits writes Dotcom. This is me talking to David Ritz.
00:09:49
Nice to see you, David. I you know, I know we talked once a while back, and you helped me out a bit with Jerry Wexler, your friend. How did that go? By the way, I sort of meant to call you and ask you, and I didn't ever. Did you enjoy the process? Yeah, I did.
00:10:06
You know, and I, you know, having read your book about Jerry was very helpful. And then talking you a bit about Aretha in a bit about Wexler was helpful. And I think the director was very happy with my performance. But I think that ultimately, you know, the WEX where you describe, you know, in in the book that you wrote with him and also in your book, The God Groove was probably a deeper dude than the one you're going to see in the movie.
00:10:33
Well, because it is in his movie. It's her. Exactly. You can't go that deep, you know, I mean, you don't have time. And he's incredibly complicated. And, you know, you're incredibly complicated.
00:10:46
I got to be honest with you. You and I had this book of yours sitting around for a long time. And you know, and I know you've written books about, you know, a lot of different people. Right. But just the other day, you know, I'm like, why? You know, I'm going to talk to him. I don't like really. Reading books that people have written before I talk to them, because it makes me lead too much.
00:11:05
So that being said. I read most of it. So I don't I did not read the end, so we're going to you're going to have to we're going to have to get to that naturally.
00:11:18
But the God group, your book, A Journey to Faith, is a great book. It's a ballsy book.
00:11:24
And I don't say this about much, but I think a lot of it has to do with the things we have in common. Mm hmm.
00:11:30
I found you're not just a Jewish thing, not just a narcissistic father thing, not just the black culture, black music thing, but maybe that's well, there's a lot of things covid.
00:11:44
But but like I said, I don't know how it ends. I assume that you have Jesus in your heart now. I think it was that where we were going?
00:11:51
Well, you know, I am definitely I definitely be leaving Jesus. And that's interesting because that's the other thing we have in common. I don't mean we have in common that particular word, Jesus, but I think we both come out of the 12 steps. And that's how I got into Christianity through the 12 steps. And and the irony is, is that when I first went into one of three different 12 step programs that I've been in for the last 30 years, if they had told me you had to believe in Jesus, I would have gone the other way.
00:12:24
So part of the genius of the program to me is to read language Christianity, to take the Christian part out of it. Right.
00:12:33
It's it's it's it's it's structural Christianity without Jesus.
00:12:38
Exactly. Right. I get it.
00:12:40
It's it's the deeds without the dude. Yeah, but the deeds to me are the dudes I mean, in other words, the deeds are the dude in that. First of all, I don't care what anybody calls anything. I I think our job as we communicate with other people is to be sensitive to their cultural history with certain words. So I won't use certain words to certain people because I know it will kind of trigger them. Therefore, it's only out of the ego that I have to tell you.
00:13:15
You have to use the word Jesus. You don't have to use any word. I mean, eye to to me, it's about the brotherhood in the sisterhood of the 12 step program. It's all about sort of allowing a full herit to wash over us, to hear from each other and to heal us as a result of embracing the spirit period. What you go on and call that spirit, how you while ideology or theology, you adapt. I don't care what I am.
00:13:49
I am not at all evangelical. And I don't like proselytizing because I believe that proselytizing comes out of ego. You've got to use my life.
00:13:59
I get it. So you're saying that you know what? You've got to get him to his God consciousness and either you're going to tap in or you not or or or don't even call it God consciousness.
00:14:09
If the word God is abhorrent to you, if the spirit moves you, whatever high power.
00:14:14
Yeah, I get. But what's interesting to me is that, you know, you're about as Jewish as you can be. I agree. And, you know, I mean, it seems to me that you were. Where were you born?
00:14:28
I was born in New York and lived there until I was about five and moved to Newark, New Jersey, and lived there till I was about 12. And then we went to Charleston, South Carolina, for a year. And then I went to Texas, where I went to high school and college. My old man was a traveling salesman, traveling salesman.
00:14:50
But they come from like your grandparents were the immigrants? Yeah.
00:14:54
Yeah. Eastern European, the traditional thing. What part did you ever track it? No, you never did it. You don't know where. They're not from. From the beyond behind the power of sentiment.
00:15:06
And generally I know the territory, but but I've, I've never done and in a weird way, I mean, I don't care in a certain way because I kind of knew them very, very well. And they were not articulate in English. And I I don't know what they speak. Well, they say, well, my my old man's parents spoke English, very broken English with a heavy Yiddish accent. But their but their first language was Yiddish and.
00:15:41
And do you speak Yiddish? No, I don't know.
00:15:44
I only know what the usual curse words are.
00:15:47
And did your parents did your father. Yes, he did. And he was good at it and he was proud of it. And and and I enjoyed hearing him speak it. But again, I never bothered to learn it and it never even occurred to me.
00:16:02
So your memories of New York as when you were very young are very it seems very clear, very clear, because they had to do with jazz.
00:16:10
I mean, in other words, my first passion as a child, because my old my old man love jazz, my first passion as a child was jazz. And and I was born in 1943. So I still got to hear the Titans, you know, Charlie Parker and Billie Holiday and so on and so forth. And that's what really kind of marked my early life. And by the way, going back to Christianity without trying to kill it here is that the two things and we don't ever have to talk about it again, this interview.
00:16:44
So I'm not trying to push it. But the two things that led me to Christianity were both the 12 step program and African-American music, because, I mean, that's clear, you know, and it's like when you were a kid.
00:16:57
So you're in New York until you're five and then you're in Newark, New Jersey. Yeah. From you know, from seven to eleven.
00:17:04
Yeah. But I'm your father. It wasn't you weren't a religious family, were you know, he was he was.
00:17:11
One of the reasons I got along so well with Jerry Wexler is that Jerry was my my foot. See my father. Right. He was, um, rich. My old man was not. Yeah. He produced Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin was my old man. Did not who he hung out with Wilson Pickett, which my old man didn't do. But he talked like my old man. I mean my old man and Jerry. As an intellectual, he was a literary intellectual, and your father was, too.
00:17:48
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, you know, they read high powered books. They knew Einstein and Freud well. Yeah, right. They knew they read, you know, Saul Bellow and Philip Roth and Bernard Malamud.
00:18:00
It's interesting that that generation. Right. Of Jews that, you know, your father was a traveling salesman, but the but the premium put on education by second, you know, first generation, second generation Jews to to sort of like, you know, to define us as a culture that, you know, you better you know, knowledge is power. Education is how you get ahead because they're not going to let you do a lot of things. So you better be smart.
00:18:25
Right.
00:18:26
And also, they were killers. I mean, they were intellectual killers. In other words, part of who I understood, Jerry as well as I did, because he was like my father. And if you got into an argument with them about whether Sonny Rollins was a better tennis player than Sonny Stitt. Yeah. Or whether T Bone Walker was a better guitarist and buddy guy, his argumentation style was to sort of destroy you if you could mean on those important subjects.
00:19:03
Exactly. I mean, he had to. And so there was a passionate antagonism as a conversationalist. Now, it doesn't mean underneath there wasn't, you know, love and affection. There positively was. But.
00:19:18
But he beat you down, is that what you're saying? He just beat beat the shit out of you down. And that's one of the reasons why I could tiptoe through his tulips and become his ghostwriter.
00:19:32
Oh, but about your father. What about your father?
00:19:35
Did he we know we had a falling out pretty early on because I understood he was he was an intellectual, a bully, as was Jerry. Yeah. And so I had to take him on. I didn't have to take him on.
00:19:53
But my personality, you have to as a when you're a son of a narcissistic father, at some point you're going to have to push him over the edge.
00:20:00
You got to kill him off at a certain point. And I know that sounds like kind of straight ahead Oedipal shit, but in my case, it was true because. Because they will eat you up.
00:20:13
Well, they deny you a sense of self. Exactly. Because because they only my dad only saw me as an extension of him. Exactly.
00:20:22
That's exactly something we share. And that's deep shit. And, you know, realizing that is it's a weird and deep thing that, you know, that you're you're just seen as an appendage. And, you know, when it's hard to see you as an appendage when it starts hitting you. Exactly.
00:20:38
And even in my own career, once it got off and I was doing OK and I was writing these books, he was never happy that I was a ghost writer because he wanted me to be, you know, Philip Roth or Saul Bellow or one of these guys.
00:20:53
He would undermine you no matter what you did. Probably so. I think so. Yeah, I think that's probably true. He was proud, but he could never tell me that. And and also he could never stop criticizing my work as being superficial as opposed to doing the Pulitzer Prize biography of of being.
00:21:19
But either way, it sends us out into the world, sort of like, you know, having they implant self-consciousness in a self-loathing in us because of our own judgement of ourselves. And then you kind of wandering around, you know, emotionally untethered, looking for guidance. Yeah. You know, from a very early age because your your parents are incapable of it. What was your mother do?
00:21:45
She was strong. She was a seamstress. She sewed ultimately, she became one of these people. She worked for Sears or J.C. Penney's, one of the she would get in the truck and come to your house and sort of measure your window for the drapes. And she sold drapes and she was a great salesperson and totally on intellectually, but on intellectual, but very, very intelligent and very kind of practical and down and cold.
00:22:18
My dad was very emotional and warm and huggy, and my mother was rather kind of distant and and.
00:22:26
Yeah, but, you know, I'm kind of one of these idiots who believes that we get the parents that we should get, or at least in my case, I got exactly the parents who I needed.
00:22:38
Yeah, but David, I mean, like, look, I understand, you know, I do that to be. You know, honestly, that idea of, you know, nothing happens in God's world that isn't whatever, but the truth is, is that you gain nothing from not seeing it that way.
00:22:55
That exact you know, without it being you more a regret, you have to frame it like that way at some point or else you're just going to you know, you're going to have a regret.
00:23:06
Well, but it's also helpful to frame it that way in that my my goal is to live in gratitude because I think I get it. I get. Yeah, no, no. The only way we don't go crazy doesn't mean they weren't shitty and in and and in very important ways they were shitty. And I can look at that and in other ways they were great. But in any event, because I'm happy with who I am now, I sort of needed them to go through whatever I went through.
00:23:38
I appreciate that. Yeah. And and and so if you can get the gratitude, however the hell you get the gratitude, whether it is sort of a ploy like you suggest that I need to frame it that way, which I don't disagree with. But in the end, as I sit here talking to you now, I am grateful to my mom. I am grateful to my dad for being who they are. I feel that way.
00:24:01
So your connection with with jazz and, you know, African-American music, black music at the time, you know, it's something that, you know, I identify with as well.
00:24:14
And this was something that your father loved and it was the Jazz Age. And you where did you get to see a lot of live stuff when you were very young? Yeah, I did.
00:24:22
I saw yeah, I saw the Titans, you know, or to me, the Titans. How old were you? Like your father took you. What how do you do that? Yeah, he took me he took me to Carnegie Hall. He took me to a jazz club in Newark. I saw little Jimmy Scott, who later on became a guy whose biography I wrote. I saw Byrd and Billie Holiday and Max Roach and Clifford Brown and and also sort of getting back to the religious part of it.
00:24:52
As I look back, these were religious epiphanies at the time. I didn't I couldn't call it that, but I was so moved and so amazed and so shook and so early music by this early music, it made me fucking crazy.
00:25:12
I know that you frame this as your journey towards towards the Godhead, but, you know, but when you're a kid, you're just excited, right? Yeah.
00:25:20
But you're also transformed. In other words, you are ecstatic. I guess that's the word. I was like ecstasy. So it is kind of like going I remember I got a scene in the book where I go to an African-American church and it looks great in there. There's Contactmusic and you're right. And you know, and I can't go in the church because I'm Jewish and Jesus is kind of creepy and I've been told it's creepy and everything in my culture tells me that's not me and yet everything is drawing me into that church.
00:25:52
The people are happy, the music's jamming. And what it's taken me forever to understand is when I went to hear Charlie Parker at Birdland or Count Basie, wherever it was, I was entering into a church and I was experience in ecstasy, that transformative kind that was lifting my heart and exciting me and taking me beyond what is the normal human condition. And I didn't know what to call that, except I had to go out and I had to buy every Billie Holiday album and every Lester Young.
00:26:30
And then when I moved to Texas, the big deal that happened to me was moving to Texas when I was 12 and a half because New York was all jazz and Texas was the blues. And I to think about the blues.
00:26:44
So you went to the you went to the source. Exactly. And so when I heard the Blan and B.B. King and Lightnin Hopkins, I understood it all comes out of the blues. And it's a blues experience. And again, it's a transformative experience. And the cliche is you play the blues to lose the blues, but you also listen to the blues to lose the blues and then even sort of deeper than all that.
00:27:15
We are in the human condition, at least for me, is the blue condition, we are born to die, so we've all got the blues, you know.
00:27:26
What was it that B.B. King told you about his conception of Jesus?
00:27:33
He didn't say that much. His. No, he wasn't.
00:27:37
It wasn't he the one that told you that God had the blues?
00:27:40
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, he did not have the blues.
00:27:44
He sent his son, his human son down, you know, and that that in some ways, Jesus was a personification of the blues man.
00:27:54
And then I guess you asked, you know, when Jesus was was resurrected, were the blues gone?
00:28:00
And B.B. said, no, of course not. The blues, don't go away.
00:28:05
It just communicated differently, right? Yeah.
00:28:09
Yeah. And I believe that is true, that I think once we embrace the blues sensibility of life, I think we are seeing reality.
00:28:22
Well, that's also a great point. Another point in the book with the Jimmy Reed story, which I mean, I would encourage anybody to to read these books for these. I mean, you're like Zelig. You just sort of lucked into these fucking moments because of your passion for something.
00:28:36
Yeah, but I don't think it was unluck. Lots of people tell me that. But my feeling about it, I chased after Jimi. No, I chased after Marvin Gaye and Ray and Ray Charles.
00:28:50
And I was rejected a lot by people who didn't want to hang out. So, I mean, I just made it a point like, hey, man, I want to know who you are, you know?
00:28:59
OK, well, I guess luck is not the I mean, I think what was lucky is not that you got in that car with Jimmy Reed, but that, you know, he happened to pull out a razor and you guys and cut his girlfriend and you guys end up at the fucking emergency room. And he tells you that in order to understand the blues, you got to live the blues. I mean, that was a gift, dude. I mean, no, no, I agree.
00:29:20
No amount of persistence was going to deliver that to you.
00:29:23
No, no, no, no, no, no. I agree. And and that's always been it's like chasing after Marvin Gaye the way I chased after him and getting together with him.
00:29:34
But let's talk about that for a minute. Let's talk about the arc of it, OK? You know you know that you know, this music gets you going like you know that you love this music. You love all of it. You have the entire spectrum like the blues and the gospel. What sort of come together to make the RB and make the jazz and the jazz comes full circle and pulls the Jesus all the way out of it and creates a new spirituality.
00:29:56
I get all that now. A couple of questions I have before I go into the arc of your career is like how much thought if you put into I was just talking to my producer about this before we start talking, that there is a type of Jew that is completely compelled and immersed in black culture. I don't know if it goes both ways. I don't feel like it does.
00:30:14
But there are certainly, you know, Jewish blues players and then also Jewish blues and Jewish music intellectuals and Jewish civil rights proponents.
00:30:23
I mean, the Jews have been, you know, enmeshed with the black experience for a long time in America. And where do you think that comes from?
00:30:32
Have you put serious thought into that? No. And the reason I haven't. No, honestly. Am I wrong?
00:30:39
No. You can make a great argument and you can show historical evidence for it. I mean, no, it's it's a highly intelligent argument. I have never put myself in. I mean, there are other Jewish people I know. You know, there's Peter were Jewish. He was a great scholar and a great writer of I mean, so I can name a lot of the Jewish people. Mike Bloomfield. Right.
00:31:05
I mean, and Peter Green and Paul Shaffer, who's whose book I wrote and who's a great, great musician and a scholar of RMV and Blues.
00:31:17
And then you get the great the great exploiters of the black people in the Jewish religion write the checks and and and, you know, so it goes on and on and on.
00:31:26
Yeah. Yeah. So, yes, there are books that have been I think one book was called Rhythm in the Jews. I mean, there's been whole there's got to be one FGI. It's not just music, it's politics as well. It's politics and social. You know, the kind of I guess it comes from social activism and from the initial kind of like Marxist sort of social activists. And right.
00:31:50
Again, the reason I have not that is of not kind of primary interest to me is because my own experience with it rests in mystery. I don't know why when I heard Louis Armstrong for the first time, when my father took him to Carnegie Hall or when I heard Charlie Parker or Coltrane or whoever it is, I don't know why. My heart started beating, I, I, I felt this connection, it didn't have to do with politics, it didn't have to do with it was a visceral, emotional experience.
00:32:30
When we moved to Charleston, I was 12, I think, or about two and a half. And I didn't my parents really didn't prepare me for segregation. This is I was born 43 and 12, 1955. So I got on the bus and I sort of naturally went to the back of the bus to sit with the African-American people because they I was more comfortable and I didn't have any attitude. I was just they were more comfortable. And, you know, the bus driver yells at me, What are you doing?
00:32:59
I didn't understand. Yeah, I. I didn't understand. And more than politics, it wasn't just music. It was sports, because I was an incredibly passionate Brooklyn Dodgers fan when I was a kid, and that was the Dodgers of Roy Campanella and Jackie Robinson. So in my mind, African-Americans were a superior race because the two things I was interested in, which was the Dodgers and Jazz, they were they excelled at home. All my heroes were black.
00:33:34
So and also you brought up in a house where your father was, you know, incredibly embracing. There was not judgment. There was not separation. There was respect and appreciation.
00:33:45
Yeah. And also I not particularly political folks. So, I mean, you know, I'm a liberal Democrat, but I am not I was never an activist. I've been, you know, writing forever. And and and so anyway, what did you set out to do, though?
00:34:06
I mean, the writing seemed to kind of overtake you. Well, I began you know, I've got kind of a weird history in the beginning. I went to graduate school at the State University of New York at Buffalo with this guy, Lesley Fiedler, who is a kind of a well known critic and a famous guy in the world of Jungian criticism. And I wanted to become him. So I got an email and I went through a PhD program and I passed my work, but I never wrote my dissertation.
00:34:40
I got tired of academics. I didn't feel like I was too academic. And I moved to Dallas and I began an ad agency because I wanted to make a lot of bread. And I moved to Dallas with your family.
00:34:53
And you grew up there and that's when you started. Right. And I think I is an agency because I can say, OK, I'm going to make a lot of money. And I had worked my way through college writing ads and I was good at writing commercials and shit. Yeah. And I did that and some pals of mine, I began at agency and we did that for about five years and I got sort of bored. I didn't care about the products that I was I was selling.
00:35:19
And so that's what I began to think about chasing after Ray Charles. I went to the library. So I there is no there was no biography or what was that what was that moment, though?
00:35:30
I mean, it's like I was there that you decided. I mean, at some point you're you're tired, you're bored with your life is an advertising age. And then out of nowhere, you're like, Ray Charles is my ticket.
00:35:40
Well, here's why. Because and that's why, again, I'm kind of grateful for everything. I'm a good salesman and I can hustle. And advertising showed me that I could hustle. So I just looked at him as a potential client.
00:35:54
But you love. But you loved him.
00:35:56
I loved him. I loved him. And I didn't love the products I was advertising, but. Right.
00:36:02
But you decided you wanted to write about what did you want to be his friend? Did you want to meet him?
00:36:07
You decided you wanted to write his biography and win the Pulitzer Prize. But then I met an agent who told me his biography is not is not as commercial as his autobiography. And I told him, I don't care. I've got to win the Pulitzer Prize and be a biographer because I didn't know what the fuck, because you wanted his dad to be proud of you. Exactly.
00:36:27
Yeah. And then the agent asked me a question, a question that changed my life. And the question was, what book would you rather read a book about his life written by an IT kid like you? Yeah. Or a book in his own voice telling about his life. And I said, oh, I would much rather read the book and so forth. So so then the agent said to me, write the book you want to read, not the book that you believe you should write.
00:36:57
And that changed everything. And even today I continue to write the books I want to read write.
00:37:04
So but but this whole compulsive kind of process of chasing down Ray Charles, very compulsive.
00:37:10
Yeah. But it was like, you know, it became you're the main object. Of your life and high on pot, and I'm nuts. I mean, I checked into the hot sheet motel on Washington Boulevard across the street from his office, and I'm stalking him.
00:37:30
I'm stalking and I'm in the office. And there's this tough guy named Joe Adams and his managers telling them you can't have anything to do with him. And then I call Western Union. I say, can you send telegrams and Braille? And they said, yes. So then I start sending him telegrams in Braille every day about how I was crazy about him. And I loved him and I knew everything about him and I wanted to work with him. And ultimately he calls me up and he says, Who are you?
00:37:56
And I said, I'm a guy across the street in a motel and I'm the annoying Jew that keeps coming up and just come over. And I knew once I got in a room with him, he would feel me. And he did. He could really feel my heart. He could feel my spirit. And I did love him. I mean I mean, he was the artist. He was the earliest artist who had the had that kind of impact on me.
00:38:24
You know, early Ray Charles fucked me up as much as any artist. And so it just happened and and I could talk to him. I wasn't intimidated. I mean, I was intimidated, but I could hang in there. I mean, I could ask him tough questions. When did you lose you? I mean, I I discovered I was good at it. And once I knew that it was his book and that my own book, everything changed because I gave him the power.
00:38:54
And once you give away power in a creative collaboration, you turn out to have more power because power is off the table and people are more willing to give and take and be free. And the discussion, I get that.
00:39:11
But like, you know, in that moment, you know, where you finally, you know, sit down with Ray Charles and you sit down, you know, as you as you got the hang of it, you know, you, Smokey Robinson, B.B. King, Etta James, Aretha, all these people all the way, you know, Buddy Guy, you wrote about everybody then.
00:39:29
But but I have to assume in that moment a guy like you who's got, you know, your boundaries probably weren't great, your sense of self not great. You know, so your ability to kind of almost in a innately symbiotic and co-dependent way to lock in somebody who is, you know, a self-centered but amazingly giving artist was probably almost innate.
00:39:54
Like you probably became an appendage fairly quickly now. Yes.
00:39:58
And also helped again by by by advertising, because in advertising where I did some well, you have a client and the client's in charge and you learn the jobs to please the client. So I'm coming out of advertising. Now, the academic part was helpful in that I knew literature to an extent. I mean, you know.
00:40:20
Right. You know, I knew you wanted to be close to Ray Charles. I want to be close to him. And I also wanted him to know he didn't have to be scared of me because these people have been interviewed a zillion times. I know by journalists who twist your words and they're angry at the press. And I kept on telling them, and this is your book. And and the truth is we translated it into Braille and he put his hands over the Braille and he made changes.
00:40:46
And he was a great editor because he was a brilliant guy. He was a brilliant, brilliant guy. But he was like one.
00:40:53
He was willing not like I mean, there's different degrees of caginess on behalf of people, public people.
00:41:00
Right.
00:41:00
But it sounded like Ray, you know, was willing to engage you and trust you. And when you did, you know, present him with a book that was written in his voice by him with you, you know, he was OK with it, even with the darker elements.
00:41:15
Exactly. Because he didn't give a shit.
00:41:17
In other words, he was a guy who was so confident about who he was.
00:41:21
Right. And arrogant.
00:41:23
I mean, I agree. I he knew he was great and he was the most confident guy I've ever met as opposed to, you know, Marvin Gaye with the opposite. He was completely in secure.
00:41:36
But the first book, Brother Ray, that was a big book right in you know, it did well. Did they based the movie on it? Yeah, they did.
00:41:42
But but it's a whole long story. It's. You mean they screwed you? It's just a long story that doesn't have a happy that's just not a particularly not a particularly interesting Hollywood story that you've heard zillion of them. But but all right.
00:41:59
So you do you do Ray. And then you think you're going to start just you know, you're going to be the guy.
00:42:04
Exactly. That does that by the helps. These guys ghostwrite their stories.
00:42:10
Nothing happened. Exactly. Yeah. And that's. Where the hustle has to kick in, because at a very at a certain point, then you're exactly right. I thought everyone was going to call me. I had done his autobiography and nobody calls me. And that's when I understand that I am in the advertising business again. I have to chase after clients. I have to get some work. Yeah, I got to chase after Marvin Gaye. I got to chase after the Neville Brothers.
00:42:40
I've got to chase after this one and that one. And I at a certain point, Mark, I also realized I enjoyed the chase. I mean, you are the honorable in that you don't like to be rejected. But I can take the rejection, you know, I mean, it it ain't going to kill me. And also, I knew Ray gave me a lot of confidence because he's a tough you know, he was a tough cookie.
00:43:05
I mean, really tough guy. Yeah. And and not particularly cordial. And so, you know, when I finally got Marvin Gaye, who happened after, it was the opposite. Like, Ray was sort of the tough uncle who very sort of demanding and you have to be on your toes. Marvin was your relaxed older brother.
00:43:28
But it was weird, though, you know, the way you kind of characterize what you're saying to me now.
00:43:32
But it seems to me that out of the 50 books you wrote or however many it is about all these different artists that, you know, you spent some time in the book talking about Buddy Guy, you know, you talk about B.B., you talk about you know, there's a good story about, you know, Lightnin Hopkins in the song about the stuttering kid that helped you sort of frame your own stutter.
00:43:55
Different.
00:43:55
Right. But but it seems to me that Ray Charles, for the reasons you just said, was impactful, but that, you know, once you got into this skin and the life of Marvin Gaye, that your mind was fucking blown for for light and dark like you were in, I have to assume, initially way over your head.
00:44:17
Well, I'm not sure tell me what you mean by way over my head. I mean, like, you know you know who you are. You know, you get a sense of who you are. But so, like, all of a sudden you're with you're with Marvin Gaye, who is like you're saying it's fundamentally insecure, like, you know, Ray knew who he was and he accepted who he was. And, you know, and I think that comes from, you know, a lot of things, you know, getting through life blind, you know, and having you know, I mean, implant's you find yourself in a way that you're not going to have otherwise, but and also being a great artist.
00:44:49
But Marvin being fundamentally shattered, insecure, a broken person, you know, with with deep, you know, deep seated conflicts around sexuality, around his parents, around his relationship with his with Jesus and with his mother and with his father.
00:45:04
I mean, I'm just saying that over your head in the sense that you have similar problems, but through Marvin through Marvin journey, which was ultimately tragic and horrible.
00:45:14
Right.
00:45:15
You know, you were able to come to grips with some of your own stuff that was sort of hard won. But he must have been terrifying.
00:45:23
I was never terrified with Marvin because he was such I got to do this right, because it's really kind of a precious thing. But Marvin Gaye was you know, I just I you know, I just did a book with Lenny Kravitz, who's an enormously charming man and a very sweet, loving man. And Marvin was it was in that category. I mean, it now, again, Lenny doesn't have nearly the turmoil and the kind of Michigan sort of of Marvin Gaye.
00:45:59
But Marvin was you just wanted to be with him all the time because he was so cool. He was relaxed. And now, again, we were high most of the time, smoking dope and snorting cocaine. So, I mean, that's was part of it. And I also think I didn't get sober till 1990. Marvin was killed in 1984. So our whole experience together involved not just listening to music and talking about theology and literature, but it also involved being high and.
00:46:33
Yeah, but I mean, but this guy was like, you know, going down hard, man.
00:46:39
Well, when I when I met him, he was not going down hard. When I met him, he had just done here, my dear, which is a great sort of masterwork. And I was thrilled with that album. This is the album about his divorce from and of course, gay. And I was a champion of that album. And I wrote a letter to the L.A. Times comparing it to Charlie Mingus and Ellington and Stevie Wonder. So I mean, this album was and again, I I adored his music.
00:47:07
I adored his music, and then I adored him. So it was not. And the other thing about Marvin, which was interesting, even when I went to Europe and we had our last meeting when we wrote Sexual Healing Together, Marvin was always able to stay home, keep me away from him when he was really in the kind of darkest periods of his life.
00:47:36
For example, he told me, don't touch the pipe. You know, when he began fiddling with the pipe, he told, Don't touch it. And he would never tell me anything. And he I mean, that wasn't typical of him. So he was very protective of me.
00:47:51
And and when he did have these extremely dark periods, he kept me away from him because I think he saw me as someone with the chops to write his story and and also may be vulnerable to not being able to handle the pipe positively.
00:48:14
And and chances are, if he had offered it to me, I probably you know, I because, you know, now recently I've done books with Willie Nelson and I'm doing a book with New York and I'm a recovering marijuana addict. I mean, marijuana to me was my main drug. Yeah. And I had to go to and I don't even know there was him a Marijuana Anonymous to get straight. But I can be with Willie or Snoop and not worry about getting high or you know, but back in 1982, being with Marvin Gaye and the idea of turning down a joint from him wasn't even remotely possible.
00:49:02
Wasn't even remotely possible.
00:49:03
You didn't you didn't get involved with smoking Coke? No, no. You did it once, so. Right. I did it one time and and it was so good.
00:49:17
And so every green light went on in my brain, I wanted to get on the roof and tell the neighbors the good news. Yeah, and it turned out that the person who got me the stuff was killed after he left my house in some drug deal. And that got me so scared that I never kind of touch it again. But that didn't keep me from smoking pot. I mean, because that happened in 85 or 86. I continue to get high for another four years until I got sober in nineteen ninety.
00:49:56
But I think what you really characterized in the book for me, you know, and that we're not leaning on too much in this conversation is that, you know, the through line of the God groove of your book.
00:50:06
And in talking about working with these, these artists was sort of like, you know, seeing your path to spirituality and belief.
00:50:15
And it seemed to me that Marvin Gaye, you know, and his struggle with himself, with drugs and I mean, this is a guy that lost his fuckin mind from cocaine psychosis and pushed his father to shoot him. And, you know and, you know, you talk about the aftermath of that and about his father, kind of like not, you know, forcefully, you know, intentionally not remembering killing his own son. But my I guess my question is, it seemed that the reason I said over your head was that it seemed that the way that Marvin framed his relationship with Jesus in the midst of everything that he was going through in the midst of what, you know, was seemingly someone surrendering to the devil, you know, was inspirational to you or some sort of cautionary tale or somehow strengthened retroactively your your idea of what belief was.
00:51:07
I totally agree, because when you are with him, when I was with him, I could see the Jesus in him. I could see that. And when I listen to his music, particularly, you know, what's going on is a Christian album. And, you know, so that he is was a gospel artist to me.
00:51:27
And and and, you know, there's there's an old D.H. Lawrence thing that he said, trust the story, don't trust the storyteller. And Marvin's story, as it's expressed in his music, is filled with hope and light and love. Now, it's also filled with turmoil because he's a blues artist and blues artists have to work their way through the blues. But because he was a gospel artist, I am inspired by Marvin and continue to be. I probably listen to Marvin more than any artist, and I listen to music all day long.
00:52:06
Which album do you go back to?
00:52:08
Well, you know, I love what's going on. I love I, I love, you know, I love them all. I mean, I like the concept album more than the singles, though. I do love heard it through the grapevine.
00:52:20
But you know, I love a trouble man. I love what's going on. I love let's get it on. I love I want you. And I particularly love here, my dear, because it spoke to me so powerfully that I had to meet him and my Hustle Marvin story. I don't know if I put it in the book or not, is that when it was attacked because the album was attacked, when it came out as being kind of personal and who cares about his divorce and why isn't Marvin talking about what he talked about, what's going on?
00:52:56
He was attacked by a guy in the L.A. Times. And I thought to myself, if if I answer the attack and I write a letter to the editor defending the album, Marvin will read the letter, get in touch with me and I'll get to that. Exactly what happened. He called me up. Anyone who are you? And I said, well, this guy I've written a book on. And he said, Well, come on over, man.
00:53:20
Let's talk. I really appreciate your understanding this album. So now, again, I was completely genuine. I mean, and but but but but I was also wanted to meet him.
00:53:32
Well, but it seemed like through him, you're able to sort of like, you know, find like he became the barometer of your ability to accept yourself because of your own sexual identity, you know, issues or discomfort, you know, through him, you know, and his, you know, proclivities around cross-dressing and his father, the preacher's cross-dressing, which, you know, which almost ultimately damaged Marvin a bit.
00:54:01
And, you know, it just seemed that he, not unlike Jesus, was the guy that, you know, you look to and said, well, if this guy can rise above this and and and still have God and his wife that.
00:54:16
There are some pathway for me, yeah, I mean, I believe that's true, and what's also true is that we just take sexual healing, which is an interesting sort of metaphor for the whole thing. We're together in Austin in April of 1982, but this is him.
00:54:38
He ran away because he was so fucked up, right? Yeah. The IRS is after Romeo's his wife's alimony. Yeah, he's depressed. He was in England. He was in Hawaii. He hasn't had a hit since. Got to give it up. I mean, he's at the lowest date of his life. Yeah. And he winds up in just beautifully quaint town in northern Belgium looking at the North Sea. And again, me being a hustler, I'm chasing after him.
00:55:02
We got to do the book. We got to do the book in the book. And I don't you know, I've got two young kids. I don't have any bread. I don't care. I'm going to go see fucking Beethoven or Mozart, which is what Marvin was to me. You know, he'll do anything to hang out with him. Yeah.
00:55:22
So I get there and on the coffee table is just kind of S.A.M. book of cartoons, which is very kind of, you know, kind of disturbing and. Yeah. And this music track is playing on the boombox and he needs a story to go with it. And I'm not really thinking about the music track. I'm thinking about this book. And I say, Marvin, this is some sick shit. What you need is sexual healing. And he says, what's that?
00:55:55
And I thought, well, you know, you kind of love a person for who they are and doesn't involve pain and you're healed from all the complexities and you accept blah, blah, blah. And he said, would you wanna just write some poetry to that? How would that work as a poem? So, you know, I'm glad that I write when Blue Teardrops, you know, and he takes his words and he puts them to the track, which was written by his keyboardist.
00:56:21
Oh, they're brown. And the song is written. And in my mind and this is what's so interesting to me and where I think you've kind of hit the nail on the head. In my mind, I'm working as a ghost. In other words, I am ghost writing for Marvin Gaye. Yeah, his script. Right. But it turns out to be my own script. What I needed was sexual healing and acceptance of the complexity of my own sexuality because one of my one of my primary addictions is actual.
00:56:57
So it took me forever to understand that what I thought was a song written for him, which was was also a song that became kind of a mantra of my own life.
00:57:12
And what is the spiritual component of that? That's the resolution of my sexual compulsivity, my sexual neurosis. Happened at 12 step meetings that had to be brought into the church of the 12 steps that needed a spiritual resolution, because I had I had tried to go to shrinks and, you know, as I did with as I did with cocaine and marijuana as well. I don't want to go to public meetings and admit I'm a sex addict or admit I'm an alcoholic.
00:57:57
I want it to go as an upper middle class Jew. I want to go to the privacy of a shrink, pay them a hundred and fifty dollars an hour and get cured. It just didn't work. It just didn't work well.
00:58:10
So in you know that somehow Marvin was able to sort of balance, you know, your message with something that, you know, he believed that that, you know, that that sex and Jesus, you know, that there was not you know, that you try to talk a bit in the book about a few of the artists who, you know, that initially there was something about gospel being sexualized by Ray Charles and it was seen as the devil's music.
00:58:38
And then there was an evolution where it wasn't the devil's music. You know, all music is God music. And that that Marvin sort of exemplified this guy who was able to hold both of those worlds in each of his hands until he, you know, went out of his mind and decided that the devil was winning. So what impact did that have on you when he went to believe it?
00:59:01
I mean, in other in other words, that's where the Jew in me was great, because because I had it at least what I call I don't mean that couldn't have happened if you were a Hindu or Christian. But I had the critical acumen to argue with him and go, that is crazy. You know, that that that Charlie Parker or Max Roach or Ornette Coleman is just as much a Erico instrument of God as you are or Lightnin Hopkins or Charlie Patton or whoever.
00:59:39
And this kind of this kind of ordinary thing. It's crazy. It's an old superstition. I understand where it's coming from, but I.
00:59:54
Rejected and by the way, intellectually, Marvin rejected it, but from an emotional point of view, given his upbringing in his dad's church, he couldn't reject it was why it was convoluted because of child abuse.
01:00:10
Yeah, yeah. But I mean, we argued about that. And I remember one of the last night we were together in Belgium. There was a documentary on Caltrain and we were watching Coltrane. And this was Coltrane's kind of spiritual period after a love supreme.
01:00:27
Yeah, he's really preachin and marvins going, wow, you know, he's really out there doing it and he's really out there. And Marvin got it. I mean, he understood that we were in the church of John Coltrane. And so he didn't say this is, you know, the devil's music. And but but his childhood conditioning and his kind of trauma, he was traumatized as a child and so was Retha and so was great.
01:00:55
And when you have childhood trauma and you don't have the means to, you just need help, you know what I mean?
01:01:07
Yeah. But also like that in that community, that's not something that happens a lot.
01:01:12
Yeah. Yeah. You know, you you keep it at home.
01:01:17
Yeah. Well, in the case of Ray, he was so strong that I mean but you know, losing your brother and then losing your eyesight, I mean, those are factors.
01:01:28
But that's not the same as like a Pentecostal minister. Father fucking your brain up.
01:01:34
No, but it's well, I don't know how you compare trauma. I mean, that's a hell of a trauma to go. It's a hell of a trauma. But you. But it's not.
01:01:41
You know, it's not. And it's not abuse. It's not gaslighting. It's not you know, that's an important distinction.
01:01:49
I agree with you. It it it is it is not abuse at the hands of a parent. And I. Right. And I think that's an important distinction. And that may be why Ray was able to live a relatively long life. But it's also important to remember about Ray and this is a story that was not told in the movie. But I think it's an important story that Ray died of alcoholic liver disease. You know, he drank himself to death.
01:02:19
Yeah, yeah. Those junkies, it's hard if they if they don't, they a lot of them switch to the the weird booze. Exactly.
01:02:26
He gave up heroin. And that's the triumphant thing in the movie. But every day he makes the gin and coffee and five tablespoons of sugar and drank from morning till night. And now again he was operative. So he would argue with you when you would tell me with alcohol. Right.
01:02:44
But they had it's funny that they can't. You can't. It's hard to get that monkey off your back, like Keith Richards, William Burroughs. They all did that thing with the, you know, vodka or whatever.
01:02:52
They had to figure out how to keep it, tamping it down. And I by the way, I'm not sure I'm not in that category. I mean, again, I don't drink or drug or idea, you know, but I'm extremely compulsive person in in my work. I'm compulsive about clothes. I look all right.
01:03:13
So if it's not making your life unmanageable, David, right? Yeah. Yeah, but no. Oh, I just don't want anyone to get the idea that I'm cured. I mean, I am I'm pretty, you know. But the other thing I want to the world.
01:03:29
Well I would we just put it out. You're still fucked up right now.
01:03:34
And and and also I accept the fact that I'm a mess. And one of the things I like about jazz and funk, particularly, you know, I love funk. You know, I like the Ohio players. And I just talked to Bootsy. Oh, yeah. But he's a genius. You know, one of the reasons I love funk, and it is because it's a mess and it's it's it's it's raw and it's wrong in some ways, you know what I'm saying?
01:04:04
And I think that is I'm just going to be that way, too. I die. I think I am a mess. I think the human condition is a mess. And I think that's why we relate so much to the blues, because the blues is a kind of messy music.
01:04:21
Yeah, but the blues, the magic of it.
01:04:23
And also, like, you know, the magic of comedy, comedy, you know, having you know, you've done a couple of books with Don Rickles as well is that, you know, they are able to there's a catharsis in the simplicity of the blues and have a good joke and that, you know, if you can take the pain and the chaos of what it is to exist in the human world and kind of render it down to a phrase or a one four or five or, you know, a few good runs of, you know, well-timed jokes.
01:04:56
You know, the relief afforded the heart by those things.
01:04:59
Is Maggette agree with you more? And, you know, I am so glad that you mention that because, you know, one of my because every day I write a thousand words, you know, I write a lot and every day I write every single day. I don't take off time because I'm juggling four books at once because of my compulsive nature and my love of my work. And I like to sit and I like to type. But one of the things that keeps me going is going on YouTube and listening to Coltrane or Carmen McRae or whoever, but also comics.
01:05:31
Yeah, I'll go and watch a George Carlin thing for half an hour. And it's like Charlie Parker. I mean, Carlin. It's just a crazy genius. And it's funny.
01:05:41
I never it's like I don't go to Carlin like so much. I if I'm going down the rabbit hole like I like lately I've been doing some Rodney and I feel that way about him.
01:05:51
I've I've actually kind of rediscovered him in the last four or five.
01:05:55
He's he's the king of pain to the king of Pandur. I underestimated him when he first came out. Everyone did. I'm going back and I'm thinking he's a blues artist, man. I mean, for sure something.
01:06:09
But but I'm also getting off on you know, they got all the old Johnny Carson stuff. So I've been I've been watching Carson with Buddy Hackett short, but he's great telling old time Jewish stories and Catskills stuff. And that's a kind of blues genius and for sure, man, you know, and then a Pryor, of course, without saying.
01:06:32
And and so. Comedy to me, I agree with you. I mean comedy to me, these are sort of a sort of nutrients. You know, we live in this toxic world that we live in and we always heart crushing in toxics, you know, watching TV. And this guy is toxic and he's poisoned our culture so that we need sort of nutrients to be healthy and not go crazy, too.
01:06:59
To me, the nutrients are Nancy Wilson and Richard Pryor and Buddy Hackett and Rodney Dangerfield.
01:07:11
And what I've been saying is you use whatever means at your disposal to maintain your sanity without hurting yourself or others.
01:07:17
Well, and also, I put it, you know, I think we kind of see things basically the I put a tiny bit differently, which is my job. I got two jobs. One is not to go crazy. Yeah. And one is to make a living, because if I if I go crazy, I won't be able to make a living.
01:07:39
But hey, man, you might have to go crazy. Yeah, right.
01:07:42
What did you have to be crazy to make a living though.
01:07:45
And I think it's a it's, it's, it's a controlled kind of craziness. Sure.
01:07:51
Of course. Yeah.
01:07:52
After a certain point, once you, once you get the hang out of how to work your own crazy, you could fucking do it.
01:07:58
What was your take, you know, spending time with Don Rickles. What was your like how did you assess his heart?
01:08:05
Well, I caught up with Don after he lost his fastball. So it was challenging. I mean, you know, he was great. And, you know, he's one of the kings in the Jackie Leonard Milton Berle tradition, you know, honored to do it. It's hard. You know, I have worked with three comics. The hardest thing for me to do is to voice a comic. I'm not sure why.
01:08:35
Well, I mean, because, like, you know, they've got they've got to like I imagine it's a little easier to but not with Aretha, but it's probably a little easier to chip away at a musician by blowing smoke up their ass.
01:08:48
You could probably get a an easier route to their heart maybe, whereas a comic is pretty well guarded all the way down, guarded and also lots of comics.
01:08:59
And you know more about this. So I should be asking you.
01:09:02
I don't know I don't know if comics have sort of a mean streak.
01:09:06
I mean, I kind of think neednt is an important ingredient to something, so. Yeah. And I don't see that as a as anything wrong or sort of negative. I think the expression of anger is important for our culture and that's why Rodney is great and Rickles is great.
01:09:28
Bro is great. So I'm not the other ones. You did. Who did you always the angriest of them all and gradual was was a crazy genius. Yeah.
01:09:36
You got to layer that charm on top of that rage buddy.
01:09:38
So. Right. But under the radar there is a kind of a maintenance sort of nastiness that's difficult for me because under Marvin Gaye or Aretha even there is a love and also sweetness and a kind of again, a kind of a godliness.
01:10:04
Childlike, childlike. Right.
01:10:07
But so in Don's case, he had he didn't have his fastball, which is very important to him.
01:10:13
The funny thing about Don and compared to like Rodney is like almost none of Don Rickles jokes were were great or written. He was it was all driven by timing and and beats and rage. But like, you know, like Rodney wrote jokes. I mean, Don, you know, most of the things he says don't even make sense.
01:10:32
No, no, no, no. Exactly. And it's all the vibe of his rhythm and five of this kind of perpetual thing. And so that I didn't have that because he was older and not well. So anyway, I mean, it was a great experience.
01:10:50
You know, I was honored to do it if I had to go through four or five drafts until I got the voice right. And it's like you were talking about there, there aren't jokes. There's just this kind of rhythmic compulsive stream of consciousness and on on.
01:11:10
Paper, it's not as funny as it is out loud. Yeah, so but, you know, turned out it was a hit book and, you know, I was happy with the whole thing. We did we actually we did two books and I would love to do more comics. Who the other two? Andrew Dice Clay.
01:11:28
And Sinbad, he's a he's a sweet guy, right, and that was an easy book to do. He's like he knows how to talk about his heart.
01:11:38
Andrew was tough. This was tough. And there was a lot of heat between us and it was tough. But by the way, if you watch that bad TV show, vinyl. Yeah. And you see Andrew's part in it. Yeah. He's a hell of an actor, you know, he's good man.
01:11:53
I've talked to him. I know. I know.
01:11:55
Dyce, you know, I really, really, really talented, brilliant guy in a certain way. But as a collaboration, it was not easy.
01:12:04
But also like, you know, you kind of you know, if your trick works, you know, you get these people to kind of, you know, present a well-rounded portrait of themselves, you know, that they you know, but a lot of people don't have the equipment to get into their hearts or or the courage to speak openly about their bisexuality like you do or you know, or, you know, your struggle with spirituality. And as a Jew, you know, kind of like landing on Jesus or sexual abuse or or sexual trauma as a child.
01:12:37
So, you know, there are just some people that you're never going to get there. And I thought that was sort of interesting about, you know, again, with Aretha that you had this persistence and this not unlike originally with Ray that, you know, this was this was the Godhead for you, was to talk to her and you talked to everybody around her and everybody the newer about everything. And they all told you she ain't going to give you anything.
01:13:01
Yeah, and that's a dark tunnel, dude. And did you ever because I remember talking to you about respect and you said, well, look, you know, because you originally were involved and you're not involved in the estate is protective.
01:13:13
I mean, in retrospect, you know, what was that experience for you?
01:13:17
I mean, you wrote a book with her and then you wrote a book about her. Do you feel like you got to where you needed to be with her?
01:13:23
Well, let me go back to me as a hustler, because I sold that book harder than any book, you know, I chased after for 18 or 19 or 20 years. Wow. Because, again, to me, it was Ray Marvin and Aretha. Yeah, I just I just had to do it. And ultimately I caught up with her and when I caught up with her, it was one of the happiest moments of my professional life when she told me, yes, you can do the jumping out of my skin.
01:13:51
And I was up for nights. I was just giddy. And I remember the first time I went to her house, I went there the night before just to make sure when I went there the next day, I wouldn't get lost and lose my way.
01:14:06
And then everybody told me, like Jerry and her brothers and said, they all told me, you are going to get anywhere. She's got this wall built around her. But I was arrogant and I was happy. I was arrogant because my arrogance allowed me to do this autobiography. But my arrogance was I'm going to be so charming and so sweet. I am going to kind of melt her and I'm going to get the intimacy, because to me, these books are all about intimacy.
01:14:34
You know, they're all about intimacy. And I did not make a dent in her armor. I mean, we had some good times in the kitchen eating food. And she's a wonderful cook and listening to gospel music and listening to Nancy Wills.
01:14:48
I mean, it isn't that we have and she was trying to hustle you, man. Right. But there was I didn't get to the heart of the story. I don't think so in either book.
01:14:58
No, I think, again, this is my ego talking, but I think respect. Is a good biography of her. I I think it represents because it isn't just my point of view, it's a lot of people's point of view. I think if you read respect, you get a pretty deep understanding of Aretha, and I'm proud of the book.
01:15:21
OK, well, what was your relationship with the production that I was in? I didn't have anything to do with it. Why? They optioned they optioned my book and and also Hollywood. Let me be sort of candid. Hollywood is not particularly interesting to me because, I mean, it's interesting. Me and I, you know, love to watch movies and, you know, but as a participant, I don't have any control. I'm just a guy at home on a computer.
01:15:44
I have no juice. Usually people if they optioned a book, they optioned book and they go off and they make it and there's a director and a producer and no one's calling me to say, ask me anything. So I knew I was grateful to Harvey Mason Jr., who was one of the producers for having optioned the book. And I know he had a high regard for the book. And I hope the book was useful to the screenwriters. But I have had nothing to do with the screenplay and have had no input, and I wish it well.
01:16:16
I hope it's a great movie. I hope you're great and I hope Jennifer is great and and I hope it helps.
01:16:21
Or she can fucking sing. Do I know. I mean, she she is crazy good. So I hope it. Perpetua, I hope it helps the legacy of Aretha. I hope the t the I hope that the television movie on Aretha is great too. So I mean I hope they're all great but all I could control. Well I couldn't control the autobiography. So the autobiography comes out, she takes it over, she keeps me around. But she's really rewriting everything, the book.
01:16:52
And I'm and I'm not happy with it because I think it's very superficial.
01:16:57
Takes out the dark parts, take that the dark path really doesn't own up to her childhood traumas. Then 15 years go by and I just can't live with myself because I feel like I know the story. I knew John Hammond and Jerry Wexler. I knew her brothers and sisters. I did a million interviews. And I kind of feel if I die, who else is going to tell this story with intimate knowledge that I have? And again, there isn't anybody else.
01:17:28
And I know her. You know, I worked with her for two years, so I made up my mind. I'm going to go out of my comfort zone. I'm not going to be a ghostwriter and I'm going to write a biography. Yeah. And and I knew it would make her unhappy. And that's what took me so long to do it, because I don't like making people unhappy, going back to my advertising client orientation, keep the client happy, you know, so so but I just knew that I had to tell her story according to my understanding of the story, and utilize all my.
01:18:04
Intimate relationships with people who are close to her, so consequently, I'm proud of the book and I'm happy I wrote the book.
01:18:14
I'm not interested in doing another biography. I'm still, you know, ghostwriting is my main thing.
01:18:22
But she didn't like. But after that, she didn't talk to anymore.
01:18:25
No, she was angry and understandably right.
01:18:29
And then also the other thing that it seems in the book that, you know, Marvin Gaye cut you out of the loop on the royalties, on sexual healing, and that that was friction up until he died. What happened with that had that resolve itself?
01:18:43
I won the case because I had a tape of us writing the song together posthumously.
01:18:51
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I won the case and have been a copyright a co-owner of the song since 1989 or 1990.
01:19:01
And but that was an instance where Marvin was not well at the end of his life. If you're not well. And he was angry and you know, there was litigation, but and Waxhaw told you to do it, you were fighting it.
01:19:17
So so. Yeah.
01:19:21
And I you know, I said I can't sue Marvin Gaye through them.
01:19:25
Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, looking back, you know, obviously you've got the hang of this and it's what you do, this ghostwriting thing and you sort out now by a lot of different types of people.
01:19:37
It seems that there are people that you loved doing and did because of your own need to do them. And then there's people that you do because you can like you know, you know, it runs the gamut.
01:19:51
Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller, you've done, you know, Natalie Cole, Joe Perry, buddy guy, you know, on top, you know, Willie Nelson, you talked about on top of the original ones that you were compelled to do like Ray and Smokey and B.B. And now I guess my question and, you know, kind of landing this thing is that what do you find in creating these symbiotic, intimate relationships with all these different types of artists, primarily in music?
01:20:20
What is the thread between them? Learning to, um, listen, you know, I grew up in a household where you waited for a pause in the conversation so you could interrupt the person and make your own point and win the argument. I have that.
01:20:37
Oh, yes. You learn how to empathetically listen. Yeah.
01:20:41
And listen with your heart. And, you know, it helps with that. What fucking meetings.
01:20:47
Yeah, well, that's where one of the first places I learn to listen, because you only get to talk for two and a half minutes, three and a half minutes. And the other thing, you just have to shut up and listen to people. So I think as I look back over the whole career, what I've learned is to listen to people with my heart. Be curious, inject humor is incredibly important. I think, you know, I'm 70, so 11 years old, I'm going to be next week is my birthday.
01:21:19
I'm going to be 73, Evan. And as I look at and I'm enjoying old age, I love old age. And I feel, you know, energetic and but but to me, all this ghost writing and I'm doing more and more and I'm loving it more and more.
01:21:37
The thing that keeps me going is loving to listen. Loving to be curious. And loving to inject humor and not taking it all that seriously.
01:21:52
Yeah, I think that's what we share. I'm coming upon that very same thing with what I do.
01:21:57
You know, Marc, most people who struggle with writing books and people with why are you so prolific? I'm having a good time. I don't take it all. That's obviously it's a book. Maybe it's good. Maybe it's bad. I'm kind of playing.
01:22:13
What do you find all the artists as well. What do you find in common that they are what do they all share? They are driven.
01:22:20
And and that's the other thing that keeps me going. I am driven. You are driven. And I'm intrigued by what is the origin of the drive, what is the nature of the drive. And the answer is, I don't know. And I love the fact that I don't know because I keep on trying to understand it.
01:22:42
Why isn't that interesting? You're willing to accept the mystery of God. That's it. And also you're coming. How are you gonna find out what drives people?
01:22:52
But I'm also willing to accept the fact that I may never know. I mean, just take take you I mean, you've done it. You know, you've done all sorts of things in your life. You continue to to be driven and you continue to hustle your way through Hollywood and blah, blah, blah, blah. Why? I mean I mean, why didn't you drive sort of into a ditch.
01:23:16
Yeah.
01:23:17
As opposed to keep going down a highway. Right. And I don't know either. I mean, I mean the idea of how long have you sat with yourself.
01:23:27
It's difficult. Exactly.
01:23:29
Exactly. So so so. So all I can tell you is that I am grateful. I am driven toward other people who are driven because I relate to them and I'm intrigued by them. And in this world where it's so easy to be depressed and drive off the cliff and give up and not to shit people like Philip Roth, I'm going through the complete novel Ten volume. That's great. Where are you? I just driven, driven. I've actually read a lot of the book, but now I'm beginning at the beginning.
01:24:03
I'm at Portnoy's Complaint. Oh wow. Which I just loved it more this time than I did the first time. But the whole thing about Philip Roth, he's never stopped writing. I can't stop writing. Why?
01:24:17
I know. Yeah, I know. Sometimes I ask that question in two ways. It's not it's not the curious question. Like, I want answers. It's like, really, do we need more?
01:24:25
Why, yeah. I'm glad the guy's got enough momentum and he's famous enough to keep working. But Jesus not getting any better, is it.
01:24:34
Well, but also I think stimulation. I want to be stimulated. I want and I'm really grateful that I love Louis Armstrong as much today as I did when I heard him when I was.
01:24:48
Well, that's just magic. You know, you know, you hear music, dude, and you hear music when you're eight years old and in a lot of music just grows with you. You know, it gets deeper, it gets different.
01:24:59
It means different things, you know, over your whole life. You know, I think it's quite an amazing thing.
01:25:06
And it was great talking to Damien. I enjoyed it. I had a great time. And here's a hug through of virtuality. Thanks, man. I think this is one of the better interviews I've ever had, but I was pretty sure that it would be. Thanks, David. See you soon. OK, great. Bye.
01:25:27
That was David Ritz, many books. The one that I last read was The God Groove. A Blues Journey to Faith is his memoir, but he's also written books with or about Marvin Gaye, Jimmy Scott, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, B.B. King, Etta James, Janet Jackson, Buddy Guy, Don Rickles, Jerry Wexler. It's all at Rits, writes Dotcom. All right, WRVS Dotcom again, find gratitude if you can. If you can't find hope, let's just hang on for a little bit of relief.
01:26:10
Maybe things will get back to something we are familiar with. Something comfortable or at least at least OK, I'm hoping for. OK, people. Happy New Year. Here's some guitar. Boomer lives, monkey lives, LaFonta lives. I, Michelle and Shelton.
