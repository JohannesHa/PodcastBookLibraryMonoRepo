00:00:00
Lock the gate. All right, let's do this, how are you? What the fuckers, what the fuck buddies, what the fuck? STRs, what the fuck it, Alex, what's happening? There's I've changed my tone to urgent. There's my urgent tone. How's it going? How are you doing? Urgency. Take a breath. Breathe in and breathe in and breathe it out.
00:00:30
Let's do a little of that. All right, everybody, come on. Come on, come on. Stop what you're doing. Stop what you're doing. Take a breath all the way in all the way.
00:00:39
Oh, go ahead and cry if you have to. I might. Oh, no.
00:00:46
Oh, God damn it.
00:00:50
I can't even take a deep breath. I mean, I've been avoiding the deep breaths clearly. Hold on.
00:00:58
I mean, it's like, oh. Oh, no, it's right there. It's right there. Oh, man, I'm holding I'm holding it in. I'm holding some of it in.
00:01:12
Sorry, let it out, everybody. All right.
00:01:15
OK, so today on the show.
00:01:20
I talked to Seth Rogen, now Seth Rogen has been on before, yes, the first appearance he was on with Goldberg. What's that guy's name? Is it Evan Goldberg, his partner. So they were on here together. This is Seth alone. And I have to I have to say that there is a trigger warning. If you don't like Jews, you're going to get triggered if if you're anti-Semitic.
00:01:50
This is going to definitely trigger you. It's very Jewish talk. It might be the most Jewish talk we've ever had on the show. I don't know why.
00:01:58
I don't know why. But is the first time Seth has been on since 2014 and we already covered a lot about his life and his early career on that episode, and so that means I had to to I had to, you know, figure out some stuff.
00:02:15
And he just made this very juy movie. It's called the American Pikul. Like, it's almost throwback juy, it's it's a movie that is so juy, you would think it was the 70s again when the Jews and understanding Jewish comedy and Jews were sort of out in the world and the dictators of a certain amount of culture back in the day, this feels like it could have fit there a bit.
00:02:43
It's that Jewy. You know, back when, you know, Philip Roth used to appear on talk shows in Norman Mailer. Yeah. Bernard Malamud, so that's going to happen, man, we're going to do the Jew thing tomorrow, I'm going to go get another covid test because, you know, that's a fun thing to do. So I go into an amusement park, you go park, you know, you get online in your car and you go through very where we go through a series of streets in turns.
00:03:15
And then you end up in the Dodger Stadium parking lot and then there's a video with the mayor. And then you're given some things, some fun things to spit in, and then you give it to another guy with a mechanical claw and then he gives it to you with the mechanical claw. And then at the end, you throw it into it another thing. And and then in two days later, they email you the good or bad news. Very exciting way to spend an afternoon.
00:03:45
I am fighting back the darkness. I'm trying to fight back the darkness. But I tell you, man. Tade.
00:03:59
As Jews, when you kind of feel the fascism coming and anybody, any of you Republicans that, you know, still listen to me who used to just like what I do and then thought I got too political and thought I was, you know, I was exaggerating the possibilities of authoritarianism.
00:04:18
Well, look what happened. Who was wrong? You. I'm not saying I told you so, but I told you so I want to be able to say it while I still can before there are, you know, jackbooted thugs coming into the garage.
00:04:35
I told you so. Hey, what's going on?
00:04:36
Hey. Hey, you can't. Hey.
00:04:40
Before that, not going live for the odds of that are tricky, they have to be listening outside. But, you know, Jews historically, I think, have sort of a radar for the fucking thing is, is that a radar? What do you like? I have Juda sure, but we have a little sensitivity to fascism. Who doesn't? Other than the people that are like, well, won't be that bad. Right.
00:05:04
It's just going to be us. What, of course. Well, what about your neighbors? I don't know them. We don't know of. That's a big question, right? How desperate does your neighbor, who doesn't like the way you think have to be? To kill you because he doesn't like the way you think, if he's allowed, encouraged or assigned that task.
00:05:27
How desperate? At what level of dehumanization are we with everybody and how we take in information, how we see other people, how how desperate does your neighbor have to be?
00:05:43
To kill you if he's allowed to because of the way you think we're kind of pushing back on China, shutting that out, creating that situation to the point where you're my idiot father who watches. And when I asked him what he thought of the pandemic, he said, well, we got to we got to get back to China.
00:06:01
I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about?
00:06:05
And he said, we're allowed to have a difference of opinion. And I'm like, that's not an opinion. That just sounds stupid. And I'm embarrassed and I can't respect you anymore. If you're going to just regurgitate garbage that you hear on a propaganda channel through, you know, your face hole into the phone at me. If you want to discuss a broader idea about where we're at now with it as a doctor. But it's a Chinese virus. All right, you know, I don't know if I can ever talk to you again.
00:06:34
So economic deprivation, economic collapse, desperation in the streets, broken spirits, hundreds of thousands of unemployed people, angry people.
00:06:45
Desperate people. Are you angry and desperate? You want to wear a uniform? What did you do in your civilian life branch manager? Would you like to be a commandant?
00:06:58
What did you do? School superintendent. Hmm? Do you want to run a camp? What did you do? I was a teacher.
00:07:05
Would you like to be a re programmer? What did you do in civilian life? As a manager at a slaughterhouse, are you able to make the jump to people? Everybody gets a hat. You're going to look good in that uniform. Can't afford clothes anymore. Sofija. Oh, you're not really cut out for that kind of thing? Well, we can put you to work in one of the state owned factories.
00:07:38
I'm sorry, is that too dark? I can end on an up note. Kind of up. Something gave me faith in the humans. Recently, I was on my hike, I was with Al Madrigal and Rory Scovel heading up the hill, three clowns, three clowns outdoors. And a guy walking down the hill was going delicately holding this little bunny. There's a lot of bunnies up on the hills right now. A lot of bunnies in a little sort of sad looking, wet looking bunny with sick bunny.
00:08:11
The guy was holding a sick bunny, this man walking down the hill with a bunny. And we're like, oh, what happened?
00:08:16
He's like, it's sick. I want to I'm going to bring it home and make it better and then let it out, it's a nondescript accent not being racist because I'm not identifying it.
00:08:29
But he had one. So we're like, oh, that's that's nice.
00:08:32
That's nice.
00:08:33
But it was just like in these times, you know, whatever he's going through, whatever we're all going through, you know, that moment where he saw this sick bunny and he decided to do that.
00:08:43
Well, I don't know what success will have, but the spirit of that, the action of that, the heart that goes into that, he's carrying that bunny down the hill. And I and I, I had read that there was a bunny plague. I felt bad because I didn't need to bring that up. But I did. I said I heard that there's a lot of sick bunnies around. And he said, oh, can I get it?
00:09:01
Mike, I don't think so, and I felt bad. I should just let it be. I don't even know if he can get it. But it was so nice that. There was something he could do, it was something he could do. In that moment. I'm going to help this bunny. I'm just saying, look. If you can help a bunny and use it as a metaphor, OK, use it as a metaphor.
00:09:28
All right, strap in for some Jew stuff.
00:09:31
American Pikul premieres on HBO Max on August 6th. That is the film that Seth is in. And this is me and Seth Rogen coming up.
00:09:49
Folks, I love Ben and Jerry's, and if you've been listening to me over the years, you probably know that I have my favorites. I have my rituals for eating them.
00:09:56
I even toured the Ben and Jerry's factory. And now there's an entirely new line of Ben and Jerry's for all of us to experience. Ben and Jerry's has three new nondairy frozen desserts that are a brand new twist on vegan euphoria. The Ben and Jerry's flavor gurus have taken a big leap this time. People they made the new non-dairy frozen desserts with sunflower butter, sunflower butter.
00:10:20
They're the perfect, sweet treats for vegans, vegetarians and everyone in between. They've got milk and cookies flavor without any actual milk. There's also creme brulee, cookie and mint chocolate cookie. All right. All plant based, all delicious. We all know that going plant based is smart for a whole lot of reasons. But I get it. It's hard to pull the trigger. That's what makes these Ben and Jerry's flavor so great. You can make that plant based leap while you're treating yourself to some top notch sweets.
00:10:47
My favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor is peanut butter cups. So if they can do a great job with these new flavors, how about we get some non-dairy peanut butter cup in the mix? How about that, huh? Let's do that. Let's do it. Check out the Ben and Jerry's sunflower butter lineup and the whole nondairy family at Ben Jerry's dotcom. That's Benjy R y dotcom. Folks, here's the thing about home security companies. Most trap you with high prices, tricky contracts and lousy customer support.
00:11:17
So while there are a lot of options out there, there's only one no brainer and that is simply safe, simply safes. Got everything you need to protect your home. With none of the drawbacks of traditional home security, it's got an arsenal of sensors and cameras to blanket every room, every window and every door tailored specifically for your home. Professional monitoring keeps watch day and night ready to send police, fire or medical professionals. If there's an emergency, you can set it up yourself in under an hour.
00:11:46
Just peel and stick the sensors exactly where you need them. No technician required. And there's no contract, no pushy sales guys, no hidden fees, no fine print. All this starts at fifteen bucks a month. We're not the only ones who think simply safe is great. U.S. News and World Report named it the best overall home security of twenty twenty head to simply safe dotcom slash WTF and get a free HD camera for WTF Wisner's that's simply safe dotcom.
00:12:14
So wtf to make sure they know that our show sent you.
00:12:29
Oh there's a Jew. There's a Jew if I've ever seen. What are you talking about. PIN him. Oh I see. So I can just see him.
00:12:38
Pandemic has turned everyone into my grandparents. I mean my wife spent ten minutes trying to get on Instagram live today so. Yeah it's it's everyone.
00:12:48
Oh. Oh. So you were trying to do it too. Yes. How was that one.
00:12:53
A problem that you just have to push a button.
00:12:55
I couldn't figure it out. Did you get on there? We did it. We did our thing.
00:13:01
I got into a rabbit hole with Amazon today. How'd that go? I don't know how it went. You know, it's like I got. Did you buy anything on Amazon today?
00:13:13
Oh, no, I'm not buying anything off Amazon.
00:13:17
But but you have recently. Right. Yesterday.
00:13:20
I mean, I see pretty much every day. Every day. Oh, yeah.
00:13:28
That's exactly. So like today the guy comes up and he gives me two packages and one is my oyster shucking gloves. Great. Yeah. And the other one was an empty envelope that was supposed to contain my oyster shucking knife.
00:13:46
And he was just OK with that.
00:13:48
No, he got he ran off before I could get him. It's probably in his fucking truck just now. Now. But now it's a problem. Now I got an empty envelope. I have no oyster knife. I got five oysters that are going to be an issue later. I have to get a screwdriver.
00:14:02
You got a rocker, a screwdriver, some shit. Have you ever eaten oysters at your house?
00:14:07
I've done it at a friend's house who shocked them. And it was impressive. And I don't think I could have done it myself. It was I tried I tried one and I was like, oh, this is not for me.
00:14:19
I saw a guy put the oyster oyster shucking knife through his fucking hand.
00:14:24
Yeah, that's exactly what I would have been that guy again, not to use. We're not meant to do that. That it is not. That's why that's why oysters aren't kosher, because they knew we couldn't do that.
00:14:35
They knew it too challenging for us to open the show, physically demanding for us, you know, that whole thing that holds you that whole stereotype about Jews not being able to do things.
00:14:44
It's not really true. And I think that movie that you were just in that I just want. Is a testament to that all Jews can do stuff there. There was a time where Jews were like when I worked at a deli. Did you ever do that? No.
00:14:57
My great, great aunt owned a kosher butcher shop in New Jersey, though, so I really wear New Jersey in Newark, near Newark. Really.
00:15:07
That's where my people come from. That's the fucked up thing. Anyway, I'll get to where I worked in a deli when I was in college in Boston.
00:15:15
For some reason, it really blew my mind.
00:15:17
These old Jews would come in and they were ex cops, plumbers.
00:15:21
My grandfather was a plumber. I come from a line of like, very tough Blue-Collar Jews as well. My grandfather was a professional. He played professional football in Canada and he was a plumber. My brother was an electrician. My great grandfather on the other side was a mailman. Ed like, they were tough. And that was that was a lot of actually where the idea for the movie came from. Simon Rich, the writer, was like, I was looking at an old picture of my grandfather when he was my age, and I couldn't help but think that if we knew each other, he would fucking hate my guts and probably beat the living shit out of me.
00:15:56
And that's exactly my grandfather. He they were nice to me.
00:16:01
But you could tell, like he thought I was soft and light was tough on me. Yeah. Like in general.
00:16:09
Like, yeah, that was a tough those were tough Jews. Yeah.
00:16:13
Yeah. Well I've always had a theory about it that there's the, the stocky sort of proletariat peasant Jew and then there's the the composer Jew. The the math Jew. Yeah.
00:16:26
And I'm definitely not a math Jew and I don't think you are either. Yeah. Whatever's happened to you to make you soft mentally I don't know.
00:16:34
But melodically I come from a big people. I have a large Jewish person.
00:16:40
You're like from the James Caan Jew. Yeah. There's and then there is Gene Hackman, who is a singular Jew and a Jew. Gene Hackman is Jewish.
00:16:51
Are you serious? Have you checked that one? Did you check that one. Got to be checked. How would I look right this second? I must be Jewish.
00:16:57
I don't. I think you're I don't think you're I think you're wrong. I don't want to hurt you. I don't want to hurt me.
00:17:02
Not I don't know. I never thought he was.
00:17:05
I'm not Jewish. Wait. No, he's now. Sorry, man. Sorry he stole it.
00:17:10
Well, it makes sense because what I was going to say is he seems too intimidating and scary to be a Jewish person. But that makes James Caan the scariest Jewish person.
00:17:19
Yeah, he's definitely up there. You know, James Caan and and I've talked to his son. I think in real life, he's relatively scary.
00:17:26
I think. There you go. He's that's that's good. He's he's that kind of Jew that hangs out with gangsters, you know what I mean?
00:17:32
Yeah, exactly. James called Lucky. Gene Hackman is not Jewish because that makes him the the the best Jew.
00:17:37
Yeah. Yeah. And his father was a butcher. Conn's There you go. No, I classify Jews as kind of soft Jews and sinewy Jews. Like I think that's like a category of the wiring's you.
00:17:50
Yeah. Like like like Madonna. Like like like Israelis are very like they're they're like leathery and like they torso.
00:17:58
They're Tevanian muscular and.
00:18:00
Yeah, no I would call, I put them in like a tough category.
00:18:03
Oh yeah. Yeah. They don't fuck around. No. Israelis aren't going to put up with our fucking middle class.
00:18:09
No. You know Jew bullshit.
00:18:12
Do you know what I mean. They don't like that shit. No.
00:18:15
It's like it's ridiculous. They don't even want to, they don't even care if we're religious, you know. I know.
00:18:19
It's like oh they want to know is that do you believe we can kill them when we just said that all this is over a country or can we kill them?
00:18:30
I haven't got I haven't gotten along with an Israeli in a long time. Yeah.
00:18:34
I don't think I've ever gotten along with it. An Israeli. So am I.
00:18:38
Jewish summer camp. There were Israeli counselors who were fresh out of the army and they were psychotic and they would torture us. Really? I never. Yeah.
00:18:45
Was it a sweep away Jewish summer camp? There was, yeah.
00:18:49
Because I went to a Jewish day camp. Yeah. And then I went to a very non Jewish sleep away camp.
00:18:55
I went to a Jewish sleep away camp where the goal was essentially to get young Jewish kids to fuck one another, to make more Jewish kids.
00:19:02
Really at that age you defined or was just planting the seeds. It wasn't just this sort of experiment, you know, and I made a lot of my sister met her husband there.
00:19:14
A weirdly a disproportionate amount of people I know produced Jewish offspring due to this summer camp.
00:19:19
Really? It's a Canadian summer camp. Yep. A Canadian Jewish summer camp to do a summer camp.
00:19:26
Everyone goes there. Were you there when you were what age?
00:19:30
Oh, like like maybe like nine to sixteen or something. My.
00:19:34
Oh, my God. So it's like every year the same people you grow up with each other, everyone gets laid the first time at the camp. Yeah.
00:19:42
Basically, yeah. With other Jews. I guess you got it. That's that's the thing. Depending where you live, I grew up in New Mexico, so we had a you know, there was like there was there was only so many Jews.
00:19:57
You got to know it's true.
00:19:59
You got where you grew up and where Vancouver, British Columbia. You know, there's a ton of you know, some. They're all in Montreal, right? Yeah. All on the East Coast.
00:20:08
Where in New Mexico did you or did you. Albuquerque. Oh, man. I've lived there several times for movies and so on and yeah, for movies and TV shows we shot was show preacher there for the first season. Like I like it there.
00:20:22
I actually like Albuquerque, New Mexico. People get the wrong impression of it because I mean, I don't think they really see the best of it sometimes when they live there. And I guess there's not much there. And I guess it's gotten a little economically depressed since I grew up there.
00:20:33
My parents are from Jersey. Yeah, mine too. My dad is from Jersey. My dad is from Newark. Yeah.
00:20:40
Yeah, my that's funny because my mother's father was from Elizabeth and I was just going to say that the that fucking cemetery in the movie, it's exactly like the one my grandparents are buried in, in Elizabeth, like there is a Budweiser factory right off of the highway right across from New York in like you get off in Newark and there's this Budweiser factory.
00:21:05
And in the shadow of that is this little old Jewish cemetery.
00:21:09
You see them as you drive around and it's just like, oh, like the people who it's the people who spent their life savings all that one hundred years ago.
00:21:18
What did it become? Right. So go out. It's so yeah. It's so upsetting. It was very true.
00:21:26
That was very true to the I think it's in London. It's in Linden, New Jersey.
00:21:31
In New Jersey. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I definitely related to that. But the thing about the Jews in New Mexico and I guess in Vancouver, too, is like they you know, I guess your parents I think we talked about this a little of the last time. You know, there has to be an effort made, you know, to get all get them all together. They want you there.
00:21:48
I went to yeah, I went to Joementum school. And your wife Jewish? My wife is Jewish. She so that worked out. I guess it worked.
00:21:56
And what's funny is I don't care. It's like like I would have been totally happy.
00:22:00
Married a Jewish person is totally coincidental and it really bothers her when I say that, like she she she wants her, he wants her Judaism to have so value to me, even though it doesn't in any way.
00:22:12
Well, I don't know that you would know if that's true until you did. I don't I bet you wouldn't be great with a non Jew.
00:22:20
Yeah. Maybe I'd be OK. I think I'd be OK. But you don't you don't you know, there's not that I was married to a Jew and that didn't work out. And then I was married to a ng'andu and that didn't work out either.
00:22:32
So, you know, sometimes religion has nothing to do with it. You should do a joke about it.
00:22:40
I said the only problem with marrying a Jew is that means everything you hated about going home is now in your house.
00:22:47
Yeah. And I found yeah, there is a lot of similarities for sure that it but there's a familiarity to that. But also, like, I was a real I found myself being like kind of a real novelty to some of the non Jewish women I dated.
00:23:01
Like it was. Yeah. Like, oh wow. Like like they'd never been around a funny person before in their entire life before.
00:23:08
So but if you're a Jewish person then you're like, I'm no funnier than your average Jewish person's uncle is. So the novelty is not I don't think that's true.
00:23:19
I think I think that I guess Jews communicate a different way. I don't know what the hell it really is.
00:23:23
But I mean, I think there's some non Jewish women. Who just like Jews? Yeah, that's also a thing.
00:23:35
And thank God for them, if you go on PornHub, you find that everything is is someone's into everything.
00:23:42
Is there a Jew like a Jew fetish on PornHub? How would that even play out?
00:23:47
Really? Yeah, there are some porn stars who are famously Jewish and their work is featured as a result of.
00:23:54
What do they look Jewish? Do would you like. You mean like. You mean men or women.
00:24:01
The men would be easier to pick out probably from a lot. I know. I know. Yeah I think. Right. Jeremy's a Jew. There there are female Jewish. The other female Jewish porn stars who inhabit it.
00:24:12
Does this part of your brain go like how did that happen? Well, my answer is it does.
00:24:18
And then my answer is like probably super liberal, very liberal upbringing.
00:24:24
If that's the weirdest thing about Jews in this sort of like, you know, this chosen people business that's been kind of put on us is that there's this there's this sense of exceptionalism, which is kind of weird because that that's what I learned about when I was at the deli. I like I had to wrap my brain around. Of course, there were Jewish plumbers, all these Jews that come over here, first generation immigrants. How are they going to figure out how to do whatever and make pickles, like in the movie or whatever?
00:24:48
And it wasn't until the second or third generation that they actually started to integrate into the middle class and upper class and make a lot of money.
00:24:55
They're sure it's and I think like to me, making the movie like like my grandmother was born fleeing Poland, fleeing like the pogroms in 1919, which is when the movie.
00:25:06
How old was she? She passed away in twenty fifteen. So she was like ninety six, maybe something like that. But she was born. Yes, she was born in 1919 in a caravan fleeing, you know, people trying to kill Jewish people and coming to America and like it. And she came to Canada. She moved to Winnipeg which is a terrible place. Winnipeg.
00:25:28
Oh my beeton little city.
00:25:31
That is my only reason I could think as to why so many Eastern European Jews went to Winnipeg is that maybe it reminded them of the time of the time.
00:25:44
Maybe it was it was the closest thing to the shtetl. A barren landscape, just a frozen, barren landscape. So, yeah. So it was. Yeah. I mean, making the movie, it was like really kind of reenacting my own history and a lot of ways. And it was I mean it made me think of it differently. It's like, oh yeah. That's why my grandfather was so tough. Like he grew up at a time and my grandmother was so tough as like they everyone hated people beat the shit out of them, you know what I mean?
00:26:13
He was yeah. He had to he had to fight you. They had to you know, I think a lot and a lot of people I think don't like just conversationally understand that, like if you meet a Jewish person in America, they're probably here because someone tried to kill their grandparents not that long ago and like and we should be in Eastern Europe.
00:26:30
Well, that was actually a plan that that, you know, when the Jews fled the Holocaust to spread out, there was actually an organization that would place Jews in as many different places as possible.
00:26:41
I think that's a better strategy, like why they couldn't corral them up again. Yeah, well, you don't keep all your Jews in one basket.
00:26:48
I don't understand why they do that. It makes no sense whatsoever.
00:26:52
I totally I agree with that strategy spread out.
00:26:57
And it would be nice to live somewhere that was not a part of the Christian apocalyptic prophecy, which is also probably a good idea, maybe settle somewhere that the Christians don't think you all have to die in order for the. Yeah.
00:27:11
And then they want us all to go there. They need a certain number. They need us to go there so we can die so far.
00:27:17
But but but it's nice to know that, like, you know, in the present, they need us.
00:27:22
There's a similar there's some very common vested interest in that.
00:27:26
In the meantime, the Christians, they they need us for their ridiculous vision. And they're not they're not they're not gunning for us.
00:27:34
Not the no. Yes. But luckily, it serves our ridiculous like our ridiculous visions are temporarily parallel.
00:27:41
Who could you imagine living in Israel? Would you ever go live in Israel?
00:27:45
No, it would be that I'm not. I'm the same way. And we're going to piss off a bunch of Jews. It's like, you know, for some reason my mother, who's not religious or whatever, but there's her generation. They're kind of hung up on Israel and they find some comfort in in it. And I've been there and I'm like, I can't I couldn't imagine living here.
00:28:07
No, it's there are parts and I think you like for like I could imagine, like, yeah, I like you at best.
00:28:14
You convincing yourself that you are far enough away from a major conflict to not worry about it. Right.
00:28:20
Which is like a terrible thing that convince yourself and like I don't understand to me it just seems very like an have to. Thought process, like if it is for religious reasons, I don't agree with it because I think religion is silly. If it is for truly the preservation of Jewish people, it makes no sense because, again, you don't keep something you're trying to preserve all in one place, especially when that place is proven to be volatile, pretty, pretty volatile.
00:28:47
You know, I try to keep all these things safe. I'm going to put them in my blender and hope that's the best place that'll do it like this.
00:28:55
It just it doesn't make sense to me.
00:28:58
And so I and I also think that as a Jewish person, like I was fed a huge amount of lies about his entire life. You know, they never tell you that, oh, by the way, there were people there.
00:29:10
They make it seem like it was just like they're sitting there like fucking doors open for the taking.
00:29:16
Yeah. Like it literally.
00:29:18
They forget to include the fact to every young Jewish person, basically, like, oh, by the way, there were people there.
00:29:24
Well, they just want to make sure that you are frightened of your own survival to the point where when you get old enough, you will make sure that that money goes to Israel and that trees are planted and that you always speak highly of Israel and Israel must survive no matter what.
00:29:42
Yeah, and I don't understand, though, and I think like for Jewish people especially who are thought, you know, who view themselves as progressive and who view themselves as analytical and who view themselves as people who ask a lot of questions and really challenge the status quo, like, you know, what are we doing?
00:30:02
Yeah, well, there's there's a thing I mean, I'm even I get frightened to talk about it.
00:30:06
You know, you start to go and we're afraid of Jews. I'm afraid of Jews. I'm a hundred percent afraid of Jews. Yes. Which as we started it, aside from James Caan, we have no one to be afraid. You know, it's those Republican Jews, buddy.
00:30:25
You know, it's scary. But, yeah, I mean, like, we're Jews. We can say whatever we want about like we should. If anyone could say whatever the fuck they want about this shit, it should be two famous Jewish people who, you know, if anyone's getting rounded up first, it's our fucking asses, you know, like we're who we are, what we are outwardly Jewish.
00:30:47
So I think like but I find that. But don't you find that like like when I watched the movie, I thought, like, wow, this is really I mean, they're they might be overdoing it.
00:30:56
It is a very Jewish film.
00:30:59
I'm wondering like, who is the audience for this? Do they are they how old are they? You know, I mean, not in a bad way, but it's very specific.
00:31:07
It's very specific.
00:31:08
And it's sort of like almost a throwback to to movies when, you know, Jews had some, you know, cultural profile.
00:31:17
It's like it's like for those few years when Australians were really cool, you know, like, I'd be like, yeah, it's like it's like Yahoo! Serious was famous. You're bringing it back.
00:31:27
You're bringing it back, bringing it back to the Yentl. Like crossing the land. Right. In the late 70s, early 80s.
00:31:35
It is specific, but I do think that there's like, you know, the themes are pretty universal. You know, I think that's true.
00:31:40
But do I felt like, you know, when I see that and I felt like in my last comedy special, too, that for some reason, even as frightened as I may be of of fascists and anti-Semite, I almost feel like I have to overstate my Jewishness to in order for other Jews to be like, all right, well, someone's taken the hit.
00:32:01
And, you know, we can all you know, I can meet him halfway, maybe, you know, maybe not at work, you know. But I do think it's important to represent for sure.
00:32:10
And Jews don't like it when you deny your Jewishness, which for me would be a ridiculously futile endeavor, I think.
00:32:18
And I think that and that is what's complicated about being Jewish.
00:32:22
And I think, you know. It's something that I've reconciled that I think the movie, it was one of the things I was interested in the movie is like unlike other religions, like you can find a corpse and determine whether or not it was Jewish.
00:32:35
You know, like it doesn't work like that with with being a Methodist. Like, you don't know what that person like because of what?
00:32:43
Circumcision or no DNA. Because if you do a DNA test, you come back is Jewish, you know, come back as you know, you come back as an Ashkenazi Jews.
00:32:55
Where did you get that? I was. I was yeah. Mine just came back. Jew. Yeah.
00:32:59
Ninety three exactly. One hundred thousand percent Jew. Don't fuck your wife, you're probably cousins but I think no. And I think that is what's different about other religions is being being Jewish is inextricable from us. Right. Is our literally our DNA brings back Jewish.
00:33:19
That's what it says on the DNA test. And if you're a Baptist, they don't know that it's your belief system. It's not who you are. That's interesting you believe, but being Jewish is not exclusive to you don't have to believe in Judaism to be Jewish. I don't write. I believe.
00:33:36
I believe like, let's round down and say I believe zero of Judaism. Yeah. I'm still Jewish.
00:33:42
I can't help it. I just am. My DNA comes back Jewish.
00:33:47
But do you think there's something about that DNA that that whether you believe zero, I mean, what does it really mean to believe zero Jewishness? I mean, you know, there's something about the the sort of legacy you are and the the threat of like the way of speaking that tumbles down through generations, inherited the trauma, inherited through our DNA.
00:34:07
I think it's also a big part of it. Yeah, I think like it's not like being neurotic is not like a genetic, you know, that's like inherited, I think.
00:34:18
But also like there's a premium put on on education and on survival and on, you know, a certain amount of of wariness, you know, and, you know, I think there was something touching in the movie just because that character that you play that isn't the the one that was the old you, you know, you know, comes to some sort of moment with his with his Jewishness at the end.
00:34:47
And it was it was kind of touching because, like, I I think you're probably more Jewish and you think in terms of actual.
00:34:56
Yeah. How deep the ritual is written into you for sure.
00:34:59
And I think also as I get older, I appreciate that religion, you know, specifically revolving around death, like Judaism has a lot of protocol that is helpful, you know, and it kind of attitude.
00:35:14
It's like, yeah, I just I went through it with the death of someone else who was not Jewish, but it was like, you know, like Jews like you get the body in the ground. Yeah.
00:35:24
You got two days, you know, and and you physically bury yourselves in a wooden box. Don't fuck with it, you know.
00:35:32
Yeah. And then the shivah thing, you know, is really kind of powerful for sure.
00:35:37
And and it happens fast. And when I've seen my wife's my wife, Lauren, her mother passed away earlier this year. And what I saw was like, it puts you to work and it forces you to do stuff and it forces you to confront it and it forces you to be around people and talk to people.
00:35:54
And it forces you to it forces you to eat and drink and and it is religion.
00:36:00
But it was one of those things where I was like, oh, this is like a very a very useful tool that religion has created around a very painful thing.
00:36:09
And and a lot of thought was put into this. And it's actually, you know, for everything I could think about, as silly as Noah's Ark is that this is not silly. This is actually like a practical, very well thought out practical protocol to do after someone dies. And whether you believe it or not, it is useful. You know, and I think that's also something that, you know, because I was I went to Jewish school and I went to synagogue and you realize that, oh, I was brainwashed and kind of just taught a lot of things that I don't believe in.
00:36:41
I was never really given the choice to make these choices, you know, decisions for myself.
00:36:45
You you drastically kind of revolt against it for a while. And then now I'm kind of the last few years have more been in the favorites, like, OK, I like yes. There's a lot that I should not have ever probably been told to take as seriously as I did. But but what were you taught?
00:37:01
Because, I mean, I was brought up like conservative Jew and I don't remember, you know, I kind of learned a little bit of Hebrew.
00:37:09
I learned to read Hebrew. I did the prayers. But like, I don't remember, you know, ever being afraid of God or taught to pray in any real way. I don't know what I was.
00:37:19
That's true. So, like, what did I really learn? I mean, like, I have no practical. Relationship with God. I mean, like it seems like with Jesus, they're like, you know, Jesus died for your sins and, you know, you ask for forgiveness and there's it's a very kind of A plus B equals, you know, you get to heaven with Jews. It's sort of like, who are we talking to?
00:37:39
You know, it's true. But I do remember. Well, but that was a funny thing, though, because I think when you're young and Jewish school, they do kind of lay it on. And I was pretty young, but I remember like I remember like my sister, who's only three years older, to be like being like, oh, none of this is like I don't believe any of this shit.
00:37:54
I was like, what? And then she's like, Mom and Dad don't even really believe in this shit. You realize, like, we're not doing this stuff.
00:37:59
And I was like, oh, wow. Like I'm being taught.
00:38:02
And that is just like I mean, it's like the tooth fairy. It's like anything. It's like, oh, you're just I was taught things that were never meant to come to fruition or be real in any way shape except to remind you at your age now that maybe there's something to it.
00:38:17
No. And then. Yeah. And then I get to it now and I'm like, oh, for these very adult things that I wasn't dealing with at the time, like death. And there's actually a lot of useful stuff to it.
00:38:26
I just honestly, Israel is the thing that I was that I look back on and look at as like maybe that was the thing I was like most misinformed about. Sure. Like, I think the religious stuff there are I can reconcile it more like with what we're talking about right now. There are tools, but like with, you know, I think like just specifically like Israel and Palestine like that with stuff that like I was and not because of my parents or anything.
00:38:54
I think just like culturally, it was not in the conversation of the average Jewish family to really get into the specifics of what was happening.
00:39:04
You don't question Israel. Yeah, right. Yeah, no, I think that's true. And also, I remember being shown Holocaust movies that the movie is like, and that was a bit of brainwashing probably for for the better, where you just sort of like this.
00:39:20
This happened. You can never forget it. It was horrible. And these are this is the pile of shoes. Here's all the hair. This is exactly what the bodies in it that, you know, never got to see them in my parents.
00:39:33
I actually always did instill and I remember my dad very, very well, my dad very frankly, telling me, like, people hate Jews. Yeah. Just be aware of that. They they just do.
00:39:47
And it's honestly something that I am so glad was instilled in me from a young age, because if it wasn't, I would constantly be shocked at how much motherfuckers hate Jews because they do.
00:40:03
And it is it is pervasive and it is prevalent and it is to many Jewish people so confounding that they don't assume it's true. Right. And I think that that is something that I that I'm honestly glad was always very much instilled in me because it's true.
00:40:22
Yeah. And it's interesting that it's confounding because hating Jews is as old as Judaism. I know it was the second thing that happened.
00:40:32
Yeah, I like it.
00:40:33
So it's institutionalized in some other religions. Yeah. In a way.
00:40:40
Super. Yeah, it's really bizarre and I think it's something that. I've also, like, you know, put it like little, tried to put a lot of thought into why it's happened and, you know, I know why it happened.
00:40:53
It was because I mean, I know part of it.
00:40:56
Part of it was because the Jews were, you know, not allowed to participate in a lot of cultural things and and things that, you know, required, like they were kind of pushed into a position. They couldn't own property. They could do this. So they learned other skills and those skills became necessary for other people to exist. Banking, you know, like education.
00:41:17
Yeah, well, they just sort of like, you know, the smart asses who are managing our money.
00:41:23
And I also think, like, you know, people obviously hate people who did not look like them. But I think that I think people also have a weird fear of people who look like them but do not believe the same thing they do. And I think that is like it's funny, though.
00:41:43
I think I can get mildly anti-Semitic with guys that are too Jewish where I'm like, there's some people where I'm like, you can turn down a little bit. You know, you're like, you know, you're white. Oh, for sure. You're you're the reason.
00:41:54
Exactly.
00:41:59
You know, like we're we're all, you know, you can be who you are, but it seems like you're overdoing it a little. I think you're milk.
00:42:04
Oh for sure. And anyone who's like super like people who are like anyone who too militant or extreme about anything like me instead of fucking people, you know, it's not even like it's just those guys are like, I don't know, should we go to the thing or not go.
00:42:18
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. You're not doing us any favors there either, but yeah they're very. Yeah, very. Yeah.
00:42:24
That just like please for the love of God.
00:42:27
Where did, where did you meet your wife at that camp or. No.
00:42:30
No I a friend introduced us to a long time ago. Yeah.
00:42:35
We met at a hotel said where else did the Mexican restaurant. Oh really. Oh you. Is it a special event. Because no one was a perfect it was actually Whitney Cummings's birthday party.
00:42:47
Oh OK. Fifteen, fifteen years ago. Wow.
00:42:52
No kidding. So she was in the comedy orbit. Yeah. She went yeah she well she actually worked. I worked on the Ali G Show. Wright guy who worked on that with me was dating a good friend of hers she's going to film school with.
00:43:08
But she worked for Robert Zemeckis at the time that we started dating actually. Oh really.
00:43:13
Yeah. Huh. So so what's she doing now? She's a writer and director. She's made a film for Netflix, wrote another film, which one did I see it?
00:43:25
Is it out yet? I don't know. It's called Like Father with Kristen Bell and Kelsey Grammer. Oh, OK. Yeah, I'll check it out. Check that out. So here's my question, though.
00:43:36
You know, we know what's going on. You know, you're you're a politically active person and you're Canadian. And I read an article that you're slowly buying up most of the Hollywood Hills.
00:43:48
So let me guess.
00:43:53
And so you're really digging in. I mean, I maybe I'm a different kind of you than you, but like for me, it's like I would kill to have Canadian citizenship.
00:44:02
I don't know what they're doing, you buying up all this property.
00:44:05
And it's like you might have to go back to Canada next year.
00:44:08
But I have an apartment again. My parents are there, my sisters where there's a lot of opportunity for me.
00:44:18
And I don't think I would leave them. I mean, things would have to get very bad for me to leave America. I love it here, but I do.
00:44:25
I mean and I appreciate like, I've I've benefited so much from living in America that my instinct is to not leave it as soon as things get rough here. You know, like I have a lot of American friends who actually reach out to me. I'm joking about not like the only Canadians I could marry, you know, but my instinct is like we can't like like things would have to get very bad in order for me to leave this country. And they're pretty fucking bad.
00:44:52
Are you going to say are you watching the same programs? I am. It's still it's not.
00:44:56
I'm still here. I'm not I'm not leaving yet, you know. Yeah. And I, I don't you know, I don't know what leaving like personally it might make me a little more comfortable, but I don't do any like grand good necessarily.
00:45:11
And I think like I get as someone who I'm half American, I've lived here forever. I just don't know. It's like my instinct is to help you right now.
00:45:18
Yeah, right. But your father, like, he's you grew up. He left New Jersey and went to Canada when he married your mother. Is that how it worked?
00:45:25
Yeah. Well, my parents hilariously met in Israel on a kibbutz, really, when they were like in their twenties, early twenties. They were doing the kibbutz thing, like they were doing their bit. They were doing this.
00:45:36
They were just kind of hippies. Yes. Yeah. And like, yeah, my mom's from Vancouver and the my dad's like went back to. Oh.
00:45:44
So now I think we talked about it a little bit the last time your dad was. He's a is it what does he do. Your mom's a social worker.
00:45:53
My mom's a social worker. My dad never he was he's always been like outwardly against the concept of work and careers in general. He never like he's worked in non-profits basically and like whatever.
00:46:06
So he kept that that that that hippie ideology, you know. Exactly. But he was never like he was always outwardly like work sucks. Do not try to gain your identity through your job, which is ironic because it's a thousand percent what I've done with my life. But it was not what he instilled in me in any way. But but but you know, but like.
00:46:26
But your job was self dictated after a certain point. It's not like, God damn, I have got to make another movie that I'm producing.
00:46:33
Yeah, exactly. And they were very supportive of me as well. So that was nice.
00:46:37
And probably because how do you make a living then.
00:46:40
The the my dad, he worked it again, like when I was a kid, he worked at the game room in the game room of the vocational school and make sure and the game by the way, the video games were literally like playing if you went to the VXI Vancouver occasional college, like if you wanted to like use the ping pong table, he would give you the paddles or and I remember this, I would go to work with him as a kid.
00:47:08
And I remember like hanging out. And because it was a vocational school, I would get haircuts, like as a kid from the people learning to be hairdressers. And I remember once a guy with no ear cut my hair, which was very strange.
00:47:23
And I don't know why it was distressing, because the odds that he was trying to cut his own hair, cut his own, you know, it was still it was symbolically distressing for some reason. Yeah. You never forget the first time you see a guy with no ear, no way he's cutting your hair.
00:47:38
It's a alarming. Was it a fresh wound or was it like it was scarred over?
00:47:42
But it was not like it seemed like last last six months.
00:47:46
I'd say your dad was a guy that sort of like don't bang the paddles on the table.
00:47:53
Exactly. Yeah. And then he became like the bookkeeper. What was the Vancouver Coalition of People with Disabilities, which was like a non-profit organization that helps people with disabilities need help to run their books?
00:48:06
He's like he dropped out of Rutgers, like he's not a you know, really he did not have like my dad went to Rutgers.
00:48:13
There you go. Was your father in the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity? I don't think he was my dad is not a fraternity type. He fenced, he was a he was one of the he was the third best state in the state for fencing.
00:48:26
And I think he won some of the fencing hippie who doesn't want to work. I like exactly that.
00:48:33
Old Zebedee Zubayda debated tão was called, I imagine, by antisemite Zionist Bankers Trust.
00:48:43
It was a Jewish fraternity. I was about right.
00:48:48
So since I last saw you, I mean, you've done a lot of stuff.
00:48:51
I mean, like how the animation business that seems like it's going to be pretty lucrative in the future when because we're never going to be able to touch each other again.
00:49:00
Exactly. How did how did that sausage party movie do? It did really well.
00:49:05
And maybe like a hundred million dollars a year. Yeah. Which is crazy. Yeah, it was.
00:49:13
I mean, we spent a lot of time working on it, so I'm glad that, I'm glad it did.
00:49:17
But no, we have plans, try to do more R rated animation and we're doing kids animation now as well, which is hilarious.
00:49:26
Like what do you got going. We're doing we're producing a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated movie for Nickelodeon and yeah, some more things like that.
00:49:39
But how does that work in terms of like is that sort of like, you know, Seagull doing a Muppets movie? How do you get how do you get access to the Mutant Ninja Turtles?
00:49:49
Um, we some things just happened with, like a phone call.
00:49:53
I it's funny. There are some things that I've been working, like, tirelessly for years to try to become a part of, and it still has not materialized. And then some things are like this. We're like Ryan Robins is the head of Nickelodeon. Around twenty years ago, he was a producer and he was one of the first producers to read Superbad.
00:50:10
And we very much got along. And then, like, I got a phone call one day and he was like the head of Nickelodeon, want to make Ninja Turtles. And and so, yeah, now we're now we're producing it as a result of that.
00:50:23
And are you writing? I'm like producing no, I'm like helping write it as a producer and being pretty annoyingly hands on throughout the writing process.
00:50:33
Were you a fan when you were a kid? Yes, I was obsessed with it. I watched, like, every episode.
00:50:38
Oh, really? Because those those characters are so defined. Right. Like they are terrified. Yeah, there's a there's a party, dude, there's the leader, there's a nerdy guy and there's a petulant, rebellious guy. It's all you need.
00:50:54
And what are what are what live action ones you got going. I mean, we have a lot of things that are now just kind of on ice and we'll see what happens. We haven't filmed anything that has not come out like the American picture was the only thing we had like produced that. Actually, the voice season two of the boys that we have a TV show on Amazon called The Boys. That's like a superhero show. And the second season of that is coming out in September, I think.
00:51:26
But yeah, we have those are the only like those willing to produce things that we haven't released and everything else. We were like about to start shooting some stuff, but we will maybe not shoot that stuff for. Right.
00:51:40
Who the fuck knows now? The America the Pickle movie. What's it called again?
00:51:45
An American pickle. We call it the Pickle movie. We refer to it as the pickle movie, The American Pickle. There was a day where I was bothering everyone at my company and being like, can we just call it the movie? Is that weird? I know. Like maybe like movies, like movies with the word movie. And it is maybe a not a great look. It does not have like an incredibly wonderful history. But I my instinct was to call it a movie.
00:52:10
And it was it actually based on a book or. No. Yes.
00:52:14
Based on a novella like like a short story by that Simon Rich wrote that was in The New Yorker many years ago.
00:52:21
And so like what what did you take from that? Like, what points of the story? I mean, I guess I could just read it, but I was curious about, you know, kind of like, you know, with any of these comedies that are a little broader, you got to spend a certain amount of disbelief, you know, four story points. Right. You know, obviously we're going for that.
00:52:40
You cannot be pickled. Yeah. Yeah, I can see it at the beginning, but it's funny, but. But is that what what was the story about? Was it exactly that?
00:52:52
Well, the story Simon wrote from his own perspective and it was about his as though he met his own. He wrote it from the Hershel character's perspective. But he was Herschell Rich from the old father, great grandfather of Simon Rich, the writer of the story. Like I get it really interesting.
00:53:10
So, yeah. So but there was the fundamentals were very similar.
00:53:15
And the I think the thing that we really leaned into when we were making the movie was like that was not as big a part of the short story was this idea of like grease and like that to me became.
00:53:29
Kind of the most interesting and original, weirdly, like all part conventions aside, it became something like I always like to think like it's nice to, at least to yourself, be able to justify that you were doing something that is not done a lot or you cannot think of many examples of that or that or that shallow.
00:53:50
Yeah, exactly.
00:53:51
Yeah. And so I was I was I was like, there's not a lot of movies about grief.
00:53:57
And it's something that everyone experiences and it's something that as as just a movie fan, it's not something I could think of, like a ton of movies that like really dive into the subject of loss and moving on and write and resiling that and how people deal with it. And you see and what we leave behind. And and to me, that and that's not a huge part of the short story, but it became something that to me was was just really fascinating and then a subject that was just really worth exploring.
00:54:26
Well, yeah. So you like as a producer, you saw this story and you sat down with the writers and you said, what about this or what? No, Simon actually came. Luckily, he envisioned it as a movie with me, like the first time I ever hosted Saturday Night Live was his first episode as a writer on Saturday night.
00:54:47
And we were both much younger than everybody else that was there at the time. It felt like there were some people around our age, but we felt very young and inexperienced comparatively, you know, and so we kind of bonded. And then the short story came out and a lot of people liked it. But I think people maybe thought it was too weird to be a movie. But we talked to him about it and he was like, I pictured as a movie and I picture it with you and I picture you playing both characters also.
00:55:15
And and it took me a long time to wrap my head around whether or not that was a terrible idea or not. And eventually kind of many.
00:55:25
And the script, it was a hard movie to crack. Like, the tone is weird. And it was something that I wanted to spend a lot of time making sure we got right. And like I do, I slow down the process always like more than any.
00:55:40
What was the concern? Just that it would be silly or stupid or then like to me, is just an actor playing two roles. I don't want to subtract from what I thought might be like a potentially powerful film by doing something gimmicky or just kind of silly. You know, I didn't want it to be perceived as self-indulgent. That's always something I'm just terrified of, even though I constantly am doing it.
00:56:01
So I think, like, all that was, you know, people just writing mean things about me is generally the concern I have before I before I do anything.
00:56:10
Can you avoid that, though, as a Jew? Exactly.
00:56:13
Yeah, I can I can mitigate it best in this culture, but I find that interesting that because now that, you know, you bring it up because I think he did a great job separating the roles and emotionally and that like I you know, now that you say what you're saying, because I can I get hung up on things where I can see where the comedy bits are and I can see where you make leaps.
00:56:38
But but, you know, it really does become about, you know, about family and about his, you know, missing his whole life and, you know, missing his wife's life and, you know, his feelings about her and going to that grave and that being, you know, sort of the beginning of this important journey. He's got to go on. And then you having these dead parents.
00:57:00
Yeah. And that like it was interesting, like this idea of, you know, what our grandparents hoped our lives would be like and how they would have to recalibrate that for today, you know, like that in and and that it's hard for everyone, you know. And I think that, like for if my grandparents were to see how I lived, they'd probably be very proud of some of the superficial things. But there are the fact that I'm not religious, I don't speak Yiddish.
00:57:31
These kinds of things would be appalling to them. And then slowly they would probably have to kind of recalibrate what they hope their future generations would become and then see that I'm a happy, hopefully reasonable.
00:57:44
You think they'd be upset you didn't speak Yiddish? My grandmother is probably a little bit like they they were, you know, like she would always say, you think you're a big shot.
00:57:57
That was one of her favorite shirts to say that, you know, my grandparents used to speak Yiddish when they didn't want us to understand what they were told, exactly what they like to like.
00:58:07
I think the things that they had, there's more of them that they wish that we did. Well, yeah, because it's all gone now.
00:58:15
It's like it's over with them. If our generation you're younger than me. If we don't keep it moving, it's over.
00:58:21
I mean, you know for sure the delis are closing all that generation, you know, of those kind of traditions or just even habits, you know, you know, like that.
00:58:32
Because, like, I still sometimes somehow it's infused in me, you know, where it's sort of like I you know, I can appreciate, you know, a good brisket, good pastrami, a good cause.
00:58:43
You just aren't Jewish. Again, if we if I found if I found your body in an alley somewhere, I could determine you were a Jewish person by the cholesterol level and by the brisket in your in your gullet. Right. But nobody like that old thing. I was always fascinated with that generation.
00:58:59
They were it was a fast and my grandma, like the character, is very much what my my grandfather was born in Canada, but he was a hard man and he was a tough man.
00:59:11
And and for sure, if we were both thirty seven years old, he would not have liked me. He would have physically assaulted me, like, you know, like and that is something you knew Hareli like to be as his own grandson that he had because I was his grandson. Right.
00:59:29
You know, like once when I was very young, I had like I stuck my toe of my toenail, cracked a little bit and ripped off my entire toe into the air.
00:59:40
And I had to go to the hospital.
00:59:42
It was it was like a big it was a big thing, you know? And that was like his approach to you.
00:59:49
He was he was a scary man. He was.
00:59:52
But he was also funny. And he was like lovely. And he had a good sense of humor. But and for sure, as he got older, he, like, mellowed out, definitely. Sure. But I also like he could rip an apple in half with your bare hands.
01:00:04
Right. Right. It was like a cookie would like he was he was a tough guy. Yeah. Yeah.
01:00:08
Well I like that that part where you know that where the older generation that the ancient you can understand your disconnection from the religion when there's pictures of you at your bar mitzvah where.
01:00:20
Yeah, exactly.
01:00:21
It just doesn't he doesn't understand how it's not integrated into your life. Yeah, and how at a time and again, our grandparents, like he was someone who was going to be killed because he was Jewish and the only reason he was in America is because he was Jewish. And that's the same thing with my grandmother. Like she the only reason I exist is because people were trying to kill them.
01:00:44
And so the fact that that is no longer this like thing, you're hanging everything on and is instead like, oh, like culturally I'm Jewish. Took one of 20 things about me, like. Right. You know, I like to play board games. I garden, I'm Jewish. Like, I went to baseball camp, I had a bar mitzvah.
01:01:02
Like, I think that concept for a generation who was the target of systematic annihilation and had to literally uproot their whole lives and come to where I am because of that targeted annihilation. I think that is something that I would imagine would be hard to reconcile where like before Judaism was like it was everything. If you were a Jewish person, you had it dictated a lot of your life and now it doesn't. And I think that is like a real right.
01:01:35
But you feel it, though. You feel it. You want to speak. We do. You want to say it is a privilege Jewish people now have, I think in America, for the most part compared to previous generations.
01:01:46
But do you feel that like, you know, you understand Jews like you know, like most of your friends, Jewish? I most of them.
01:01:53
Very few of our Jewish friends. Yeah. Yeah. But like, you have childhood like. Well, my friends from Summercamp. Yeah.
01:02:01
You're still friends with them for sure. Yeah. Yeah. It's wild right. It's wild.
01:02:06
And none of us are religious and do anything. I know but but you, but you have an understanding.
01:02:11
There's also like not that long ago there was like thirty fucking Jews on earth. And so like if you go back like a disturbingly few amount of generations, we're all related to one another.
01:02:22
Like it. We are. Because I guess.
01:02:25
How far back have you gone? I was on that show. You know, the show finding your roots.
01:02:30
Oh yeah. He got back six generations. Oh yeah.
01:02:33
My family go they. Rogan is an unchanged last name, minus two.
01:02:39
Is that Ukraine mine two from Galicia. But that's the other side. My my friends actually from the palace settlement in Belarus. In Russia.
01:02:48
Yeah. My grand one side is from Ukraine and from a place called Chernof, which I think is now in Russia. And my grandmother literally does not did not know where she was born or on what day she was born because she was born like in a caravan fleeing the pogroms. Wow.
01:03:08
You should get on that show because they do a good job. No, I would love to.
01:03:12
They'll go all the way back. It was they did a Jew show is me and Jeff Goldblum and Terry Gross. And I'm sure they and I'm sure you're all related.
01:03:20
Not that far back in some capacity. Right.
01:03:23
I guess I guess we're related. I don't know. We might have been in the same neighborhood. I mean, I don't I don't know if we're related. It's why do you think we're sick?
01:03:30
It's why we have all these. It's why we're riddled with disease.
01:03:34
I mean, I know it seems like the the Orthodox, the Hasidim are a little tight, like their gene pool is so tight that they're actually producing Jews that don't even look like Jews mean like if they didn't have the getup, you wouldn't know they were Jewish.
01:03:49
You know what I mean? They've mutated beyond Jew. That exactly creates some other things. A whole new Jew.
01:03:57
How do you feel about the Hasidim when you like? What is your first reaction when you see them in your mind? Again, not doing us any favors?
01:04:05
I am. I also am always thinking about how wizards are clearly based on Hasidic people. Like, yeah, we know culturally as wizards is based on people like Gandalf is based on the Hasidic people.
01:04:21
It's so funny. I didn't realize that.
01:04:23
Well, they are wizards, you know, I get why have a hundred percent get why they they're the only ones that understand certain things he's got.
01:04:35
You've got to be deemed worthy to understand it. But but also you have to be stupid in every other way. Exactly. But but like the thing is weird.
01:04:44
I used to think that too. They're not doing us any favors on some level, but they ultimately are a community in direct reaction to the Holocaust and that the only reason they're living the life they're living and reproducing as much as they are, is specifically to make sure that the world is populated with very Jewish people.
01:05:06
I don't want what's our game, what's our end game here? How do we make it? I hate to break it to Jews. We need not Jews or I can't like.
01:05:18
There's a lot of things we are again, we are not cut out to do ourselves. We we we need the help of our non Jewish friends. I don't have like, you know.
01:05:26
I don't have I'm not going to have any kids. Yeah, I'm not either. Do you guys decided that it's just going that way?
01:05:34
You know, no one's turning against it. Yes.
01:05:40
You know, you didn't have the last show. Funny, because we listened to the last time I interviewed you. And I was with I was deeply enmeshed with a person who I was going I was totally surrendering to having children with.
01:05:53
But that I got out, buddy. I got it. God, no. We have kids. I don't like ice. Yeah, it seems crazy to me to have kids.
01:06:04
Does your sister have kids? She has two kids. Yes. I think that's the more two more Jews to put them on the list.
01:06:11
But you can you like you like her kids, right? I do. They're great. Yeah.
01:06:16
Because, like, for me, I'm just like I can't like right now if I picture myself with a child, I'm freaking out.
01:06:22
Me too. I would I'm not happy because I'm like.
01:06:26
And where is what are they doing?
01:06:28
What is he doing? What time is very much should happen. Right. Yeah.
01:06:34
I like and I think about the only problem with not having kids is like, will you regret it. But like that window is such a smaller window than the regret of having kids like you.
01:06:45
Can I if I had kids now I can regret it for the next 30 fucking years. If I don't have kids, I'll regret it for like the last few years of my life and then I'll die, you know what I mean? It's not going to be like it's not a prolonged thing right now.
01:06:58
Would you have one of those people, though? Like I could you'd be a good father.
01:07:03
I that's not my fear. And me and my wife were like, that's not our fear. And like, our friends are always like, you'd be a good you'd be good parents.
01:07:10
We're like, yeah, no, that's not why we're like that. Like, I hate to break it to you. Like some of the dumbest motherfuckers out there are good parents.
01:07:18
Like, it's not that those would be like, you know, there are you know, everyone has kids.
01:07:24
It's what is your fear then?
01:07:26
I don't want that that I'm happy not having kids. And then I'm like, get cut in on your you time.
01:07:32
Yeah, exactly. Right, right. Right. And that the world is burning. And I look at me like, why did you bring me into this fucking shitstorm. You knew it was bad. Like Yeah, no, it was bad.
01:07:45
By the time this shit was happening, you didn't let me able to Google that day they were conceived can be like, sure, sure. Yeah. The fuck was going on. Yeah.
01:07:53
Why did you fucking bring me here. Yeah.
01:07:56
It's like those are the two things we talk about. And my wife, like, you know, Lauren has had, you know, a much sadder life than I have.
01:08:05
And there's a genuine like like life is not always fantastic. And why break well into that, you know. Right.
01:08:12
Right there is that is this a gift that we're giving someone or not?
01:08:17
You know, I think yeah, believe me, I've definitely thought about that. And the funny thing is, is that, like, I've never. And I've been married twice, and it was just never a thing that like it was I never thought about doing it like I mean, I knew I could, but like I'm like I'm not compelled. People who want kids, they want kids. Yeah.
01:08:39
You know, tons of people just don't even fucking think about it. And it's like.
01:08:41
Right, like right. It's just what you do. It's just what you do. And that's what that's I can't quite understand them because in my mind it's like, you know, you don't have to you there's plenty of people.
01:08:52
You don't have people. Yes. And if anything, there are a few things worse for people than other people.
01:09:00
Like what problems are more people solved?
01:09:04
Do you have you have pets? I have a dog, yes. That I love very much. Oh, that's nice. Yes.
01:09:10
So what was great talking to you? What happens now? What are you going to do today? Oh, that's a whole day already. You've been doing this all day with the talking. No, not at all.
01:09:20
I don't. I don't I try to I, I use the phrase I'd rather do fewer, more impactful things.
01:09:27
Yeah.
01:09:29
So I'd rather to be I know I'd rather talk to you for an hour in the day than talk.
01:09:34
I don't do a ton of I heard, I heard a secret, I heard something about you from somebody who had been to your house years ago. Yeah. I just want I want to I want to check it off the list.
01:09:45
Was there a tunnel there was. How are you my yeah, my house had a tunnel that it was it was a speakeasy and there was a tunnel that went from the backyard into the neighbor's backyard.
01:10:00
Wild. Yeah.
01:10:02
And the door was one of those speakeasy doors like a giant wooden door with a little like when really opened up. Yeah. You can see outside. Yeah. And and yeah, they had a big I mean smack in the middle of West Hollywood, but it was, it was a speakeasy.
01:10:19
That's wild man. What else what else do you know about the history of the place that it was built in 1916 I think and OK.
01:10:28
Yeah, and it was turned and during the prohibition it was a speakeasy in West Hollywood. It has a basement, a tunnel in the back in a basement, which especially for houses, because at that time were like nonexistent.
01:10:39
So you have a basement.
01:10:42
Yeah, it's well, it's tiny. It's enough to hold like, I guess some kegs of beer and shit like that.
01:10:50
Well, congratulations on all your success.
01:10:52
It was nice talking to you, too. Thank you so much. Was Jewish conversation of all time. See, we don't believe in the ship and it's all we can fucking talk about.
01:11:00
So I think you you made the movie, buddy. You made the movie. It's true.
01:11:06
I can't help it. I don't like it anyway. You to. Hey, man, if you didn't like Jews before that talk, you probably don't like them now, or if you wondered if you like Jews, you love them now can go either way with the Jews. American Pikul premieres on Biomax August 6th. It was a pleasure talking to my brother Seth Rogen. And now it's let's play some guitar, not unlike I've played before. Boom, our lives.
