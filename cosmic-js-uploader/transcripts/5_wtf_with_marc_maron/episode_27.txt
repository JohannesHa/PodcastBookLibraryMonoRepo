Folks, I've talked on this show about how the Internet has become pretty fucked up, and it turns out Firefox agrees they're on a mission to unfussy the Internet. They're the only major browser backed by a non-profit. They don't sell your data or sell you out. Downloading an independent browser like Firefox supports a company that's fighting to protect what we actually like about the Internet. To download, go to Firefox dotcom slash WTF. Lets on fuck this shit together, huh?
00:00:29
Get on board for the great on fucking. All right, let's do the show, lock the gate. All right, let's do this, how are you? What the fuckers, what the fuck buddies, what the fuck? STRs, what's happening? I'm Marc Maron. This is my podcast, WTF. Welcome to it. How's it going? I don't know, man. It's just like one day bleeds into the next. I get up early, I go to bed late.
00:01:04
I don't know why. I just do. Every day feels like a week with no dates and days have no names. I just know that.
00:01:13
Well, I got to do this today so it must be Monday.
00:01:16
That's what I know. It's all dictated by who I'm talking to. I'm talking to you Mondays and Thursdays.
00:01:22
I talk to you and then I talk to people during the week. Some of them come over like today's guest, Wayne Coyne from The Flaming Lips. He's actually been on the show. Both guests this week have been on the show.
00:01:35
I don't usually do this, but but I got I got Wayne today because he was here. He was he was on the show, like back in 2012, episode 276.
00:01:47
We did it in Oklahoma. I was performing in Oklahoma. He came to the show and I talked to Wayne in a hotel room in Oklahoma.
00:01:54
And I feel like we talked a lot about fear of plane crashes. But I got a text from him a few weeks ago. He's going to be in L.A. You want to know if he could come by and talk and do the thing because he's got the new record out.
00:02:06
And I was like, why not?
00:02:09
If you're brave enough to come over, I put the plexiglass up and we'll do a fucking live one. We'll go one on one, face to face, mano a mano. And and do the thing, so he came over and, you know, it was great, I mean, it's nice to see him, it's nice to talk to people.
00:02:29
That's the thing about this time that we live in. It's hard to talk to people. Mask's are sad. We have to wear the masks. And I, I wear mine. But when I look at all the other people in masks, it's like I'm glad everyone's wearing them. But what a sad time. But it's important to reach out to people. It's important to talk to people one way or the other. I know I do these Instagram lives in the morning sometimes and I just talk to, you know, the roomful of strangers there from five hundred to a thousand people kind of hanging around listening to me ramble on.
00:03:01
Sometimes they're they're good. Sometimes they're sad. Sometimes it's just the way I'm living. But it gets me connected.
00:03:07
And I know that some people feel connected to that.
00:03:11
But it's also important if you have friends to talk to them, if you have family to talk to them occasionally.
00:03:16
No one's got any answers. No one can solve the problems. But I mean, it's nice to know they're there, isn't it? And I seem I don't know, I'm a little I don't know why I'm less frightened. Maybe it's just because it's this hour, this ten minutes or this day, or maybe it's just the spectacle of the incompetent huckster clown king and his minions. Maybe it's that that becomes undeniable. What a fucking bozo piece of garbage person we have at the helm of this fucking bread and circus of conspiracy addled dumb dumbs and Christian and Time's death cult acolytes just in this plague spreading parade of hate in the name of Jesus, in the name of liberty.
00:04:12
And they're just too caught up and frenzied to know that they've been conned into eternal servitude in the fucking stupid section of hell. By this fucking gorgeous George look in front of a lesser demon looking for a way out and the only way out he can see is to stay in the saddle. And use the fucking government is a money laundering operation. Maybe the clarity of that, all of that. Maybe I assume that some people are seeing that maybe I assume that it becomes undeniable after a certain point.
00:04:55
It's not even about stupidity, it's about shallowness. And it's about servitude and it's about the need to follow. They need to make sense. It's just exploited and distorted, it's just most people have have been kind of shut off somehow, I think there is an evolution of entitlement and narcissism and and self actualization, empowerment, the idea of seeing yourself as a brand, a content generating brand, you are a brand out in the world more than you're a person.
00:05:36
So the idea of the brand, what is my brand? Who am I as a brand? How do I fit out there into the context of content? What am I?
00:05:48
And that leads to a lot of like top five lists and either or questions and likes and dislikes and sort of this ongoing evolving resum√© of pop culture ticks and strange sort of reaching back to a very short history of nostalgia.
00:06:12
So how's your brand going? So all that effort into self actualizing your personal brand to manufacture your personal content out in the world has left you intellectually crippled. And I'm no fucking genius.
00:06:30
It's just I was trying to figure out where the shallowness comes from. It's that nobody most people are not called upon to use their brains. They're called upon to repeat themselves, to honor the patterns that dictate their lives, to take in information that makes them feel good.
00:06:48
Not doing your own thinking is tricky, and sometimes it's hard to know if you're even capable of doing it.
00:06:57
But if you don't try to figure that out. You're going to be part of some fucking parade and you're not even sure where that ends or why people are watching it.
00:07:10
If your brand is intact, you know exactly what your likes and dislikes are and your top five or top tens of just about everything, and and you take a relatively decent picture of a meal.
00:07:26
And if you're an employer and you've got a lot on your plate, like running your business, ensuring workplace safety and much more, leave your hiring to the one place that makes finding qualified candidates fast and easy, that place is zip.

00:08:34
The smartest way to hire. So I have been wrestling that wrestling, I've been it seems I don't know if I talked about this, that my grief has sort of evolved. Or or morphed into a kind of baseline sadness.
00:08:53
There was a blackout here at my house the other night and I'm just sitting in the dark for two hours. And that silence of a weird blackout don't even know why it happened. I pulled out my cooler and put in the ice things and threw the meat in there. Didn't know how long it would go on for.
00:09:09
But I sat there and I realized, you know, I feel that that tugging at my heart that that weird it's not depression, but it feels a little like depression where, you know, your your spirits sags and you feel some sort of hand lightly holding your heart, you know, and it's coming from deep, deep, somewhere deep within you, deep within the ground, deep within the the earth, I don't know.
00:09:34
But it's just a little tug at your heart and it kind of pulls your mind and it pulls your spirit and it pulls it down a little bit. It's just a tug of war. It's not bleak. It's just sad. It's heavy.
00:09:48
There's a burden, a burden of sadness, of loss. So I guess now the shock and trauma is over, then you can't help but revisit it if you've experienced some sort of tragic loss.
00:10:03
How one person was here and then quickly they were gone and you saw them fade away. Now, that's been months ago, and now there's just sort of this sadness and it's just really what it is. Is I miss her, I miss her. I miss Lynne, it's not that I'm lonely or that I miss having someone around.
00:10:22
I miss her and her not being here is final. And I got to live with that. Then you start thinking about the heart, what is your heart, what can your heart take really? Many of you have sort of tucked yourselves away into something that's lasted a long time and you've built families or whatever, I just was not that guy. So what I do and what I've done over my life is I've been with many different people, some for a long time, some four short times.
00:10:53
I've had my heart broken the few times I've broken a few hearts, which is horrible.
00:10:57
Leaving somebody because you have to because it's the right thing to do with you is not easy. It hurts. It's heartbreaking in its own way, even if you're the one that makes the decision and then carrying the burden of hurting somebody else is what it is that weighs on your action.
00:11:14
Of breaking that heart and giving your heart to somebody else and have that end. I've had that happen a couple of times. And it's just how much can your fucking heart take, it takes a toll. This underneath. You know, everything that's going on in the world. It's hard to process. So I see a therapist, I talk to friends, I cry. It's just life. It's a human thing, man. This is part of it.
00:11:49
Heartbreak, loss. Missing people that were once here and are no longer. But I bought some plants. Finally bought some plants. For the front yard, I guess I'm going to hang out. And I planted a few in the ground, I guess that's a nice way to I guess that's a fairly common way to feel regeneration or growth or do something to honor somebody's. I should be more shallow either or give me your top five, what are your likes and dislikes?
00:12:28
So Wayne Coyne, he's a great front man of a great band and The Flaming Lips. It's their 16th studio album, American Head is available now wherever you get your your music, and I was happy to see Owain.
00:12:47
He's a diplomatic cat, he's a charming motherfucker, but he's also psychodelic warrior, and it was nice to talk to him.
00:12:55
Here's me and Wayne Coyne. How does that compare to and is it good to go out and you're good at this, you want more, you want less, you good? I think that's just perfect. Yeah. So you've been have you been your own engineer for, like, ever? I have, man. I can't. I mean, it's funny, you know, because that used to be it used to be like a thing like this would have like ten people doing it.
00:13:25
Yeah.
00:13:25
Well, some guys, you know, we'll have a producer in house, you know, my my guys in Brooklyn and we've just worked it like this. How hard is it to produce two guys fucking talking? It's just the mic is what's important.
00:13:39
And these are good mikes. Your show is always sounded good. You use this.
00:13:45
I don't even I don't know. It kind says. I mean, you know, it's one of those same sevens man. It's like a sweet vocal tones.
00:13:52
You don't know your mike well, but you've got your you've got I know you got padding and everything in here.
00:13:57
I know we're kind of breaking the rules a little to get the ventilation going because I like here's the weird thing about the pandemic is like I'm not I'm not like I know I'm probably good because I'm a fucking nut.
00:14:08
I get tested every two weeks just because I'm a nut. Right. But like, I'm so paranoid that I'm the guy, you know what I mean? You mean you're the guy that's going to spread it. Yeah. Oh, I see. Why would you be the guy? I don't know. Because I'm a nut. I never feel. But you're you're you're good. You mean like just physically. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:14:26
I mean, I thought about this on the way over, you know, like I think that's, you know, I just knowing you, I mean not knowing you that well I know you from your show.
00:14:33
I know that about you.
00:14:35
You know, God always look you see what you see is what you're worried. You know, you're I mean, it's a nice way to say I'm a worrier, too. Yeah.
00:14:43
But you seem healthier then than ever.
00:14:45
I am. I you know, I go up, I hike. I was mad I couldn't hike today because I can't breathe. And then like an hour or so ago, like, my eyes were hurting. Oh, fucking smoke. My throat. My chest feels I fucked up.
00:14:56
I couldn't tell, you know, I mean, I'm not all right. Now, lay L.A. that much mean. This is not common for us either. OK, you know this. Yeah, we have fires, but it's the fucking apocalypse, is it.
00:15:07
I don't know.
00:15:09
I mean, I didn't see I mean, it's like hazy when I see there is some. Can you smell it a little bit. But I mean, I mean I remember in L.A.. Yeah.
00:15:19
In the 80s it would be so smoggy. Right. And no one cared then and now there's a fire.
00:15:24
And did you notice the sun this morning? Did did you did you have a.
00:15:28
Well, I have to say, you know, we drove in on was it was it late Tuesday? And it was it was already like that just from the wind blowing.
00:15:37
Did you make you made the run from Oklahoma. Yeah. Yeah. So you drove through my my home state, New Mexico.
00:15:42
Oh totally. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So we're at I grew up in Albuquerque. Oh well yeah, yeah.
00:15:48
I been through there a hundred thousand times.
00:15:52
Yeah. I'm just up there to I drove up to Taos so I saw that, I saw your your posts and stuff. Yeah. So nice it is. Yeah. It's beautiful. It's not the greatest drive in the world is it. From Oklahoma.
00:16:02
Well we've got a nice family car now. Yeah. Brand new Volvo and man you know it just does everything for you.
00:16:10
Yeah. It tells you if someone's coming up behind you. If I stop for you. Yeah. No, yeah. You know, it's like oh my gosh it's good.
00:16:16
Yeah. It helps when you're texting and looking at your phone.
00:16:20
Well I guess there's another way I'm on its own break.
00:16:23
I mean, you know, I try to remind people that there were plenty of car accidents before people could text. Yeah, there's plenty of reasons just to fuck up and, you know, kill everybody. But there's more because of that, I imagine I have to assume.
00:16:36
Right.
00:16:36
But but even getting over here with the the way the GPS and all that work sounds like, oh, my gosh, you know, it's amazing.
00:16:43
Yeah. We don't have to think at all finally. Well, you know, I've been like I was thinking about it was the first time you came 1984 with the band.
00:16:51
Yeah, 1984. 1985 with it. With the original band. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. This is the only band your kids.
00:16:58
Twenty twenty three. Twenty four. Yeah. Young kids. Enough compared to now. Oh yeah. And what were you doing, what did you do the very first time we drove out here.
00:17:08
My old man had like one of these just I forget what it was like an old old Pontiac long big long car.
00:17:17
Right. We put a trailer on it. Yeah. It was the only car like that we were getting. We couldn't rent a van or anything back then, you know, put a trailer on it and we crashed.
00:17:30
But there was some road construction and we crashed and the trailer flipped over in that way, like on the outside of L.A..
00:17:38
OK, so we're driving just all not even make it well.
00:17:42
Well, you know, as it was happening, that's what we thought. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Our first trip and we're I mean, at first you're just lucky that you're not dead, right.
00:17:51
And then you think, oh, you know, we fucked this up and now we're not going to make the show.
00:17:54
But, yeah, the trailer turned over. We had to get out. And it's all like it's damp. I mean, it's all dhuey. It's in the. Early morning and it's all muddy and we turned the trailer over, and for some reason the whole thing just works again, we pull off and we get on down the road to the to the show later.
00:18:11
And that's we're unloading.
00:18:12
Nothing is even messed up. None of the equipment's fucked up. Nothing. All I remember and this is a superstition I still have.
00:18:18
Yeah. Even to till now. Yeah. From 1984 I took my shoes off. I was a passenger. Yeah. I just got done driving, I took my shoes off and I made a sandwich. Yeah.
00:18:31
Some kind of cold, you know, turkey or something. That chicken or something. You get in a thing. And I remember we Greeks who are swerving thinking we're going to die. And I after it's all over, my hand has squished the sandwich.
00:18:47
You can't see it on your podcast here, but my hand is squished. The sandwich in the the bread and the meat is. And I remember thinking, oh, man.
00:18:56
And then I put the sandwich down and then I'm annoyed that I have to put on my shoes, you know, and ever since then I'm just more like ready like a fireman, you know, like I'm ready to go because this could happen any second.
00:19:12
I thought you're going to say something like, you know, whenever I'm approaching a city, I have to squish a sandwich in my hands because I'm superstitious. That would be you. It would be like there would be it would go deeper with you. For me, it was just you're prepared. You but you're right. I don't really eat a sandwich. I don't eat a sandwich anymore.
00:19:29
Maybe maybe I'm not on your level, but I'm almost you know, you're on the road, man. You make it as probably all you guys were eating. It was it was just annoyed me that I didn't have any shoes on. Like, if like if I really needed to help my friends, I'd have to put my shoes on first or go around.
00:19:44
Oh, I see what you're saying. So, you know, if there's a gas fire and the car is about to go up, you know, there's no time.
00:19:52
I don't you know, it's like, you know, how relaxed should you be when you're just traveling down the highway at 90 miles an hour?
00:19:58
You should be pretty relaxed. You think? Should I ask you should be like a ready and prepared. Yeah. I mean, but look, man, it's like a straight away I'm driving you driving through Death Valley. You did it the other day. You driving through the RV? Yeah. Like there's a point where you're like now got to freak out for gas.
00:20:14
Well, I agree. I mean, it's almost too it's almost too relaxing. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's, that's, that's, that's why driving and podcasts are so perfect. Exactly. Yeah. Now it's now going to obsess about that. About the sandwich. No that fucking noise. Oh that's OK Mike. You're only the second guest I've had with the Plexiglas setup. Oh I see. And I for some reason in my mind it's like it's essential to get into the habit of having airflow.
00:20:38
Oh, I got you. Yeah, but what the fuck do I.
00:20:40
So you mean the flow. So so we're not this, this there's no regrouping. Er there's no, I don't have the air conditioner on it yet but you know look I mean I'm sure you will find. I know. Yeah. No yeah.
00:20:50
I mean, I mean I was tested just the other day so I'm going to go tomorrow. It's not going to help us today but I'm sure I'm fine.
00:20:55
I can speculate. It really is.
00:20:57
I know. Then you'll read like you could have got tested and then it didn't show up till today. And I know it's you got the test only buys you as much time as it takes you to go into it anywhere. Well, yeah, but I've really been anywhere either. That is freaking you out though. No. On a day to day basis. No, not really. No. I mean, in the very beginning, you know, I mean, I didn't really know if we were going to start to see just bodies laying in the street, you know what I mean?
00:21:25
Dropping dead like. Yeah. You didn't know how well how alarmed you should be, you know.
00:21:31
But but, you know, really, this is this is the way it really is. It's you know, people are dying and people are really sick, but it's just normal. It's just a normal day out there. You can't really tell. I understand what you're saying. Like, every day I get up, you know, I sit on my porch and I don't feel the presence of death. Yeah, exactly.
00:21:52
Other than inside my own brain, I've watched a couple of your morning coffee things. Yeah. You get yeah.
00:21:59
I mean, not not the entire thing, but I but, you know, you're you're really good at reading the screen. Yeah. And still being present in the you know, while you're right.
00:22:12
But I notice when I look at it there's long pauses when I'm reading. But who gives a fuck I don't give up. I know sometimes I would forget that you're reading and I'd be like, oh dude, he's or I'm just responding to things. And it sounds like I'm just thinking that I got to know where I go.
00:22:24
Oh, well, yeah. Well, I would have done this. I would have been like I would forget I'm on. Right. Right. And I'd just be yeah. I'd be like, oh, he's forgot but no. You're reading.
00:22:34
Yeah. Now I know. Yeah. So you wouldn't forget your own. You've been on for twenty years, you know, like you're always on. Yeah.
00:22:40
Yeah. I mean like but that's a new thing, that igy thing. I didn't do it for a long time but now because like of I don't know man, you know, it's sort of helping me in the sense that, you know, I'm not working in front of audiences and I would do those things maybe once or twice a week. Oh yeah. Yeah. But, you know, it's been a few months, you know, since that the tragedy that I've gone through.
00:22:59
Yeah, yeah. And do. We we I mean, not to interrupt you, if we listen to your your stuff that you did right after that. Yeah. You're inspiring. I told you that. I told you that when when you were going through all that.
00:23:13
And it's still inspiring to be around you even right now and said it is it's the heaviest stuff ever. And but what what you do, though, is you you talk about it and you you're you're right in it. And that's that's a valuable the truth is so valuable. And that's that's a heavy, heavy, cool thing because, you know, a lot of people would just decide, oh, this is something No. One, I'm not going to talk about this or whatever.
00:23:41
Yeah. And it's like I don't know. I'm so glad you talk about it. And I hope it helps you. Definitely helps us. You know, we're listening to you. And because I really did worry about you and just hearing you and knowing that you're I don't know. It's powerful. Yeah, it really was.
00:23:59
I didn't know how else to handle it, you know. And I'm fortunate in that, like, you know, I put it out there. I didn't feel like I had to do it, but I felt like my audience has been through not unlike you. Like in a sense that, you know, you have a unique relationship. I think the the lips have a unique relationship with their audience like that, that there is an element of salvation. Yeah.
00:24:18
To the advantage of what you do. You know, like there's a lot of people that, you know, kind of look forward to it with all their life and hard to get out and, you know, get to where you take them. And for me, like, I know that my audience had been through a lot with me and that, like, it's not so much it was for them, but it's like I don't because my producer was like, take the time.
00:24:39
And I'm like, for what? I got it. I'll talk about it. I'll live it. What's with it. Yeah.
00:24:44
And you know, but now that it's sort of settled in and like, you know, like today was, you know, today was heavy, you know, you had some of these. It's heavy, man. You know, you just think like, you know, the fragility of it all. Well, yeah.
00:24:58
Yeah, she's gone. Yeah. It's like I'm here. Yeah. But it's just like it's devastating and it's devastating on a on a day to day basis. But it's fundamentally human, like in talking to you about like, you know, when you think about the psychedelic experience or the sort of continuity of things which you seem to think about, what I'm going through is something everyone goes through so well.
00:25:23
But a lot of people go through it and they don't have they don't articulate anything about it.
00:25:27
And I think that's that's where I mean, you know, I'm lucky I get to do music. And I you know, I love writing songs and so.
00:25:34
Sure. But part of, you know, even you being a performer, you know, part of you doesn't always know what you're going to say.
00:25:44
I say that about songs all the time. You know, you don't ever you're not sitting there thinking, I must say this. Right, right. There's something in you wants to say something.
00:25:51
And and really, that's that's I mean, we overuse the word therapy, but this therapeutic, to say it out loud, say it even if nobody else hears it in a way, you know, just you expressing it, even if it's just to your own ears.
00:26:06
Again, there's just something about that, especially in a world full of of bullies and in a world full of, you know, sort of kind of knotted up emotions.
00:26:17
Well, I mean, what's great about your show is that it it's not just a sound. You know, it's not just a couple of moments where you've got to throw all this. It's got to be heavy. It's got to be entertaining. It's got to be quick.
00:26:29
You know, you can talk and you can keep you can go. You can keep the idea flowing around.
00:26:35
And, man, there's not even very many people in life that do real conversations like that.
00:26:41
You know, no one. You know, I notice that I used to like to have those conversations, you know, where you grew up in. You know, it's not the Southwest, I guess. What is Oklahoma? The Midwest. Yeah, Midwest. Yeah. But there was a time in our lives like if you don't grow up in a big city where you're just wandering around talking to people. Sure. Yeah. You know, and but even even like the like the driving driving around in the back.
00:27:02
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. We would have, we've had conversations that would last for months. You know, you would have started it at the beginning of the tour. You have another ten hour drive and you get back to the evolving conversation. And then and now I mean, I mean, don't get me wrong, I think there's plenty of plenty of people that I know that. Yeah. You know, you can sit there and talk with, but most most stuff isn't isn't it's not in depth.
00:27:27
It's not reflective. It's not. It's not. Oh, I'm learning something as I as we're talking about it.
00:27:33
I mean your your your show is so great like that. It's almost like you're learning stuff from your, your guests and they're learning stuff from you while it's happening. Yeah. No it's exciting. I'm learning. Exactly. Yeah. Like the last time I talked to you is like a million years ago it was I actually tell people I used to say it as a joke.
00:27:52
It was like in the mid 70s when you and I talked, it felt like it was like because we could be like 70s characters.
00:27:59
I know, but. But, you know, some. People know it's not this wasn't the 70s, but some people just say, oh, yeah, sure, it might as well.
00:28:08
Yeah, I mean, like we did I did the show and we were in the hotel room. We talked a lot about and we were in fears of planes.
00:28:15
Oh, totally. Yeah, but but then, you know, went to your show afterwards and it was great. It was kind of wild. It was great. It was a great I mean you were the trip. You're funny.
00:28:25
You're funny and all the time really. But but at you know, when you're in the arena there, when you're in the theater. Yeah.
00:28:33
It's like, oh my God, somebody has been so pathetic but so great and and and but but, you know, that is the thing that people relate to. I mean, it's it's it's it's difficult for anybody to be as brutally honest about themselves as you are.
00:28:49
It's terrible. But I'm laughing right. Then it is it's what I do know. It's a mess. But but like when I remember we talked a lot about plane crashes.
00:29:02
You talked about your brothers. How are your brothers?
00:29:06
I'm trying to remember everybody seems to be about the same. I mean, the maybe one of my brothers has eroded since then, trying to think of when that was dead.
00:29:18
Like dead. Yeah. Oh, yeah. How many are there? Well, I've got Tommy, my oldest brother Ken is next to him and then my sister Linda. And then Marty is the one that OD'd on some sleeping medication. Oh, Jesus. On purpose. No, no. I think it was just. Yeah, I mean, you just, you know, just by. And I'm sorry. Yeah. For sure. How old was he, your older brother?
00:29:44
Just a little bit older than me. I'm I'm fifty nine now. So he would have been. Yeah. Just like he would have been 661. Was he struggling with the thing he.
00:29:52
Well I mean I, I don't want anybody to feel sad for me or my brother. I mean he lived such an insane life as, you know, people that do and they've lived a thousand lives. They should have been dead when he was twelve, which is so crazy. Well, yeah. Yeah.
00:30:10
And so, you know, he did every drug that was available. I mean, he and he did everything that he wanted to do. So, yes. Very sad in a sense.
00:30:22
But, you know, when no stone. No stone unturned. Right. Yeah.
00:30:27
He didn't he didn't hide from any anything that was that was scary or dangerous like you and I, I mean, I, I always was.
00:30:36
Afraid of stuff, I'm a bit of a pussy for sure. I mean, you know, he would be racing motorcycle, not on drugs, you know, like that go out and like, man, I've always sort of looked up to those guys, you know, and like, you know, aspire to be that guy. But, you know, I'm the guy and like, all right. So I pushed down, too. And it's in second, you know, I can't I mean, there is just those dudes that just they don't think they're going to die and they don't well know that.
00:31:05
So, I mean, he was exactly like that.
00:31:06
So it's so I mean, not that it still wasn't wasn't about horrible, but it was you know, there was a thousand times that I thought I was going to get that call and I and I didn't, you know, and eventually you get that call and.
00:31:21
Yeah. So what was the funeral like? Did you do like a Flaming Lips New Orleans style?
00:31:25
He sort of I think it was by his request. We took his his his ashes. Yeah. The cremated ashes in a big thing.
00:31:35
And we drove around the racetrack where he would race on drugs.
00:31:40
Yeah, I know. That's good. That sounds bad. But I mean, I've done drugs. You've done drugs. No racing car.
00:31:47
I haven't I haven't done like that type of dose of that level.
00:31:51
Oh, I don't know. I know. I just want to be racing on everything. I mean, if you think. Yeah.
00:31:57
Like everything which is. Yeah. Yeah. Which made them like a super super human you see.
00:32:04
Took the ashes and you drove around, drove around the back.
00:32:07
We were sat in the back of a truck and then we would we'd spread them out and I it was you and your other brother.
00:32:12
Yeah. Yeah it was, it was, it was absurd. It was great.
00:32:15
You know, and that's what you want, you know. Yeah.
00:32:17
That you want something like that just to be like this is this is the way he lived his life. This is this is great.
00:32:22
And it wasn't it's not overly sad when I, you know, things like this happen, but it allows you to think of them a lot, you know, which is the great thing.
00:32:33
Like, you know, you get to remember them and think about them and.
00:32:35
Right. You know, and we're not I wasn't young when this happened. So, you know, when these things happen, if you're in you're a teenager and you're even early 20s, you know, it's devastating.
00:32:44
But by time you get to be in your 50s, by the time you get to to have the thoughts of, like, any day now, you know. Right. Yeah. Then it's different or that you're just used to you know, you're I don't know.
00:32:57
You know, there's a there's a time in your life when you have you just have never thought about it. You've never thought that you're going to die or anything is going to die. You just have never given any thought.
00:33:07
Yeah. And then you get this such a punch in the face, such a such a the wind blown out of you and you don't ever you know, for me, I don't ever want that again.
00:33:16
I always want to be prepared and always want to be a little bit aware that there's there's tragedy out there, although it was the first time because like, you know, with you know, look, I my best buddy in high school, he died.
00:33:26
I've known plenty of people that died. You know what? What happened? Well, he died after high school.
00:33:30
I don't know how I got, but but not long. I mean, he wasn't he was in his 20s, but but he had this massive asthma attack and was tragic. But, you know, but it was like what I experienced with Lynn dying was is, you know, ongoing. It shifts your your DNA man. I mean, it's like there's there's some other thing that clicks in when somebody you love, you know, dies tragically or something is removed from you that dramatically that you were so connected to.
00:34:00
Something clicks in. I don't think it's unusual. I think it's totally human. I think it's there's this every cell in your body realizes like the loss, but also like this shit is fragile, you know, and you know, and it's.
00:34:14
Yeah, it's here. One second it's gone.
00:34:16
Well, and the and there really is the world is chaos that all the time.
00:34:23
When was the first time you experience that. Have you experienced that.
00:34:26
Well, I talk about it in a song in one of our new songs. So I've talked to an American head on American heads called it's called Mother, Please Don't Be Sad. And so it's it's a story of when I was working at this. Did you have the Long John Silvers in court?
00:34:45
If, of course. Yeah, Longit not. Of course. I mean, we had everybody we had all of them. We even had some other places. Don't we've got Blake's lot of burger. Don't know that. Right. Do you have Whataburger in Oklahoma. We have waterbird had Wartenberg. We was in Everywhere We Go weekly Piggly Wiggly no doubt. Circle K, Circle K. Good.
00:35:04
All right. I mean, we would be a little bit of a test market, like if it works.
00:35:09
Do you remember when Schwarz's showed up. Yeah, yeah. It's a big day. Yeah. Yeah. I remember when I was in high school about the same age we go drive when there's a new fast food place, you're like, oh fuck this.
00:35:19
Slutsky Oh yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. There's almost felt fancy. I remember when Wendy's happened. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:35:25
That was a big day that the fresh square burgers. I know.
00:35:29
I don't know why like back then it just sort of seemed like now we get to have more, you know, fast food.
00:35:35
I don't. I mean, it is good, you know what I mean? It's like, you know, and get cravings for McDonald's cheeseburger just straight up. Just just. Yeah, yeah. Donalds cheeseburger. Yeah. And, you know, not even with fries, just like if I'm going to eat it, I'm going to eat it.
00:35:50
And it doesn't really taste like a cheeseburger. It just takes like a McDonald's cheeseburger. Yeah. Do you remember when the Big Mac happened. We were kids. Yeah. Yeah. Your lifestyle. I mean, I mean used to be you know, even even it still is.
00:36:04
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know why they never had one lately. Yeah.
00:36:09
Well someone had one and then they're trying to eat it in the car. Even though I was driving it was still messy even for them.
00:36:15
I'm like that's just too you're right. It's like that. I mean compared to like the cheeseburger cheeseburger.
00:36:22
It's like it's just trying it out in that bun type man. You're not worry about it. Yeah. Yeah. It's all I could feel like. Got that sauce man.
00:36:32
That's got that much of those little squares of lettuce around the outside of it and it's just flopping everywhere. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:36:38
But Long John Silvers. Yeah but they're not around even now. Oh no. Yeah it was, it was, it was a big undertaking. The Long John Silvers. Like there is a costume that people had to wear and it was a costume you know.
00:36:53
But I mean I would, I would work not every Saturday. But when you work on the Saturday. Right. I would have to wear the the pirate outfit with a patch that went over your eye. Come on. I really it was you, the pirates.
00:37:06
Were you working behind the register? I had to cook. I'd be cooking. Yeah.
00:37:11
With with an eye patch. Yeah. And you know, it's difficult, you know.
00:37:16
I mean, like I in like the last two or three years ago I was wearing an eye patch when I would when we'd perform as The Flaming Lips, you know, but I would have a hole in it and I could see out of it, you know, what was it?
00:37:29
Why do you wear it? Was it just to look crazy? You know, just to be it was in some sort of reference point to your you know, it started out as a demon.
00:37:37
I had to get the one Judd Silvers out of me.
00:37:40
Well, I.
00:37:42
I had it because I have these confetti launchers, these hand-held cervetti launchers have about 50 of them. I shoot them all during the show. Yeah.
00:37:52
And they're in a big like a drum case. Yeah. So I can grab them whenever I want. Right. And one night I grabbed one and the trigger is, you know, it's connected to a CO2 cartridge and the trigger is just a little thing. If you pull it, it shoots out.
00:38:08
Well, I grabbed it in the trigger, got caught and he shot me right in the eye.
00:38:11
Oh, it's got a lot of velocity, you know. Yeah. And it hit my eye.
00:38:17
So that's a violent celebration, shooting yourself in the face of the confetti guy just when we're getting ready to go on stage.
00:38:25
Yeah, yeah. And and it hit my eye so hard that I couldn't tell if, like, half my head was gone or if I was fine.
00:38:35
You know, it's like it just you don't know for a couple of minutes if this is. Yeah. And I held my head and I went over to one of the guys because it's all we're all getting ready to play and it's all dark and lights are out. Yeah.
00:38:46
And I said look in my eye and see if it's just a big hole there.
00:38:49
Yeah. And I pulled away and they were like that didn't look like nothing.
00:38:53
You see, we really were in that much shock that were like weren't clear whether your eye was not in your socket.
00:38:59
Well you like it is hit so hard. It was like like it's like numb, you know, it's like you're waiting for the pain. Right. Right. I would have been bored in shape.
00:39:07
Well or it's or it's just a hole for like thirty seconds and then the water and then the blood is getting stuck in your eye socket.
00:39:16
But everybody's like no, I didn't like anything but I couldn't even see, you know.
00:39:21
And so for most of the show and it doesn't matter.
00:39:24
Yeah, that's what shows. Are you right. You do what you got to do, you know.
00:39:28
And I really was very thankful.
00:39:33
Like, I never realized what having two eyes how great it is because you take it for granted.
00:39:38
Well, of course, you know, and there was this whole time just like men, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Like even this distance that we have right now to the microphone. Yeah. You know, it's all right.
00:39:48
You've got to have the depth perception. We just one. Yeah, I'd be everything flat.
00:39:53
I'd be hitting my face and I'd be just, you know, there's a lot of stuff going on, so. Yeah.
00:40:00
So this long John Silvers, I you know, back then, there just is no reference as like I don't even know if I'm seventeen or eighteen.
00:40:10
But, you know, I started working there when I was 16 years old, kept working there until the early 90s, so started in 1977, kept working not the not exactly all the time, but back and forth till early early nineties, early 90s when we got signed to Warner Brothers. You worked at Long John Silver's on and off for. I did.
00:40:30
A decade.
00:40:31
Eleven or twelve years. Yeah. Oh my God. I know. I mean, I. So much, so much what vacation time we could go on tour for six weeks and I would still get I'd still get paid, really? You were a lifer.
00:40:48
They you know, they. Did you ever wear the outfit on stage? No, no.
00:40:53
I mean, by then it wasn't much it was just a those silly shirt bandanna.
00:40:57
But but I would I don't, you know.
00:40:59
No, of course it looked cool enough, you know, but so there is a famous murder that happened in an Oklahoma City that the Serling's stockade murders. I remember those.
00:41:12
And the it was a couple of a guy and his brother and his wife went around to a couple of places and and robbed robbed the restaurants and would put the employees into the walk in cooler and then shoot them to the head. Oh, my. Yeah.
00:41:30
And just mysteriously, like, there's no I remember it happened. And, you know, there's no there's no there's no clues. It's like, you know, who would do this? You know, what's going on, you know?
00:41:42
No, no. It's just random stuff, you know? So it's it's big news.
00:41:47
You know, it's on the news every day. It's in the paper day and all this. And if you work at a restaurant, fast food restaurant, you know, this stuff is just in your mind. You know, it's just everybody's so vulnerable.
00:41:58
Yeah. So we're about to close up and these guys run in the front door, which isn't that unusual. But then they you know, there's like a side door where the bathrooms and then the the cash registers and they just burst through of behind. So they're so now they're on your side. Yeah. You know, the counters here, but then they just pass through, you know, that moment of like what's happening.
00:42:22
Well, you know, at first you just don't really know. It's again, it's this chaos, the chaos of the world. You have no idea what's going to happen.
00:42:31
Then suddenly it's just, man, you know, they've got these guns and they are so they're just so pissed off. You know, they're ahead of you.
00:42:41
You know, they're already they're there to scare the shit out of you. They're angry and they're pissed and they want the money. And you just get the feeling they'll they'll shoot you. They of course they would. You know, and they they, you know, get on the ground, motherfuckers get on the ground.
00:42:53
And, you know, just 20 seconds earlier, I'm just ready to get off work. I'm just a dork. Kukan the last hushpuppies.
00:43:02
And then, you know, suddenly and I don't know what and it must be the adrenaline and stuff that happens to you when this when you're it's flight or flight or something.
00:43:14
You know, I really did think I was going to die. I remember just on the ground, on the ground and and they're screaming at the assistant manager for her to open up the safe. And you just don't you know, you think, well, this is because other people have been killed around the city, you know, and I really did think I'm going to die. They're going to they're going to shoot me, you know?
00:43:38
And I remember thinking about I was going to stop at my mother's house afterwards. I would stop there every, you know, every three or four days and drop off my dirty uniform. And I would talk for a while and then I'd go to my apartment or whatever.
00:43:54
And I remember thinking, my mother's going to worry where I'm at because I'm not going to show up.
00:43:59
I thought, you know, she's going to start thinking it's getting late now. We're weighing this and I think you're dead. Yeah. And I'm thinking she's going to start a worry. And then that thing that you you know, you see in movies or whatever where the cops.
00:44:12
Yeah. You know, hey, you know, are you you know, Wayne works at Long John Silvers and there's been a robbery and he's been killed. And, you know, this all just flies through your mind. And I was I don't know why it's so easy.
00:44:26
You know, it wasn't more of a panic to do something else. It was just like, fuck, this is how I'm going to die. Like, I never it could have I never thought of it before.
00:44:36
I thought about, like, maybe I should call my mom, not call. I mean, you know, I know, like, just that's that.
00:44:42
Yeah. It was like she's going to be worried. It's. Yeah.
00:44:45
And and that I wanted to tell her, you know, she would just be like, why did they do this to Wayne? And I just wonder and it's like this just the chaos of the world. We weren't doing anything wrong. And this is just the way it was. I wasn't out causing trouble. And, you know, you know, it was like it was there's no there's no white.
00:45:03
Yeah, yeah. Like exactly. You know, and so that was the part of me from beyond. Wanted to let her know like this isn't the you know, this was just I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
00:45:16
You know, I think about that too. In light of Lynn's death, it's sort of like you can't it's almost like you can't you can't ask those questions if you want to maintain your sanity, you know, like you cannot you know, like, you know, there's these moments where you have these God moments or whoever in the movies are. Whatever where someone dies, they're like, wow, yeah, there's no fuckin answer to that. Not like that in real life.
00:45:41
No, no, there is no answer and there's not it's better that there's no answer.
00:45:47
You know, to me, this this I wasn't I mean, I've known plenty of people that have looked for trouble and, you know, deserved to get killed. I've known, you know, there's plenty of that. But this was just a random right, you know, and sure, they were robbing us. And this, you know, they were in the wrong or whatever, but it didn't it didn't hit me like that.
00:46:05
It didn't strike me like. So how does this play into the to the is there a theme to the record?
00:46:10
Well, I think the chaos of the world.
00:46:12
Is that what you're doing? I think we just started to to sort of highlight we had a few songs that started to seem like we were singing about some, you know, nostalgic 70s stuff. Now, I'm almost 60 years old, but Steven, the other songwriter in the group, he's eight or nine years younger than me. But he's you know, he was he was in a big family like I was had older brothers, drugs, violence and crazy shit, you know.
00:46:40
Yeah.
00:46:41
So a lot of the things that we we would be talking about happening to me when I'm 17 or 18, but a lot of stuff's happening to him when he's like 10 or 11, you know, from that era. Same type of stuff, I think you're saying.
00:46:54
So like the way things impress upon your mind are different.
00:46:58
Well, or just that it's drugs. It's 70s. It's older brothers.
00:47:04
Well, yeah, because like death, you know, like even I remember, like, I'm fifty seven. So you're a couple of years older than me, I guess. But like I remember when don't you remember when you were a kid, like, you know eight or nine and everything was the 60s. Well yeah. I mean like I was born in 63 so 69. I'm six or seven. Yeah. And just like what everything look like.
00:47:23
What people look like, it was like you just want to be part of that shit. It was cool. Groovy man.
00:47:30
Well and when you're young it is, it's quite easy to be believe the utopia optimism that was happening for me.
00:47:39
It was wonderful. I just wanted to have long hair in those pants, man. I still do. You do in it. You got all the pants and long hair you want.
00:47:49
But so this you know, this awakening when you're seventeen or eighteen years old, this it's like what you talked about suddenly it's like this is this shit is fragile. Yeah. Which I've never I don't know, you know, you know people in high school that get killed and you know, but it doesn't happen to you.
00:48:08
I know it and I always knew it in my mind, you know, have a panic. I was like, I don't want to die my sick, my dying, you know? And then sometimes if you freak yourself out enough or you're in a situation like you were, you feel the proximity. Right? So there's yeah, there's an insane panic there. But when someone you love goes, then you're like, wow, then then it's like, you know, all of a sudden you're like it's a different feeling.
00:48:32
It's tangible, it's real, and you're dealing with an absence. You can't make that up in your head. You feel it. You feel it. Well, I mean, I think in in movies and even in in music. Right. It's such an accelerated thing that it does, you know, you can feel nothing at the very beginning of a song. It starts to play and suddenly you're feeling all this stuff. Yeah. And then the song ends and you're kind of back to your regular life.
00:49:00
You know, they need to be played again and see if it will work again, which it kind of does work if you're careful, work your whole life.
00:49:06
But, you know, real life doesn't just stop like that. You know, the flow doesn't just flow over you. It's just always kind of it's always kind of there, you know? Yeah.
00:49:16
But I remember after this happened just being aware like anything could happen. Right. You know, I still am like that now, you know, like even staying across town, you know, I still think someone could break into this house.
00:49:33
I mean, you know, you see murders, murder documentaries all time.
00:49:37
Every night. I bought a bat. I got a bat. Yeah. You know, but here's where the here's what I was thinking of.
00:49:44
Like, I think that all the time. Yeah. You know what I got? I got some hornets spray. There you go. See, and instead of like a gun or a bat, it's like, I don't want to shoot you. I don't know if I'm going to get the bat in time. But the thing is, like, I got an alarm on my house. You got an alarm, don't you?
00:49:59
Well, I do, but I only said it because it's like it goes off so much that you can't set it. Yeah, yeah. My fear is like that someone's going to hit me in the head when I'm sleeping. Yeah.
00:50:09
It's very it's very specific. I've talked about it with other people. I mean, like they just come in and bludgeoned to death. For me that's the scariest thing. Yeah. It's like. Yeah. Like, like how Bob Crane died. I was thinking exactly.
00:50:23
Bob Crane, he was staying in some hotel with some weird buddy who something went wrong and his buddies said, well we're lucky. I mean I've got a big house. We have got a. Buddy, we got dogs and we got you know, we have some some element of but what I was thinking, though, too, is like, you know, I grew up in New Mexico where there was guns everywhere.
00:50:44
You're in Oklahoma, you knew friends, but we didn't we didn't have them. I mean, I didn't have any. I'm just saying that, like, the menace of it. Yeah. Like I remember, like, you know, we used to drive around, you know, you get your license when you're 15 in New Mexico driving around, go wherever where the kids are, you know, like some dude I know, like, they were out there driving around.
00:51:04
They got smart with somebody. Some guy fucking shot a 38 into the door, didn't kill my friend, but he had that bullet hole in his fucking door. Well, again, I know it's like we're I mean, we're lucky that we're, I guess, here, like all of it.
00:51:18
Yeah. We're actually I'm speaking from some sort of weird white privilege. I mean, there's fuckin war zones in this country. And I'm talking about this one event with a 38 that almost hurt my friend.
00:51:28
Well, no, I don't. I think we're just lucky. I mean, I think and I don't I, I mean, I don't even want to be around it.
00:51:35
I mean, there were protests, you know, earlier in the summer and especially in Oklahoma. It's like I mean, maybe it's it's it's it's probably true everywhere now, you know?
00:51:45
But I didn't want to go just I mean, we have a little baby and it's like I just didn't want to be even if I'm not being specifically shot at, it's like just some place where bullets are going and people are pissed off. You don't want to raise the possibility of you dying. Yeah. Exponentially just by being at a place. Yeah. Yeah. I had moments of my life though, like I was going to ask you, because like the weird thing about death is that I've definitely and I'm sure you have as well, just given our lives.
00:52:14
I've definitely been in situations that were not going good. Yeah, it did. Yeah. But in my mind it might. And this isn't when it's going to happen. Oh I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've definitely had that because it kind of reminds me of being on the floor, but it was the opposite. You felt that it might be the end of you but I've been in cars with fucked up people going over it like you know, where it's sort of like, yeah, he's going too fast.
00:52:38
I think he just ran over a curve and and I'm in the back seat.
00:52:42
Is not gonna have like this. Oh, I see. I'm not going to happen. See, I say what's going to happen. I think I would I would have just been I mean, I would just be so certain. Like, why wouldn't it? I mean I mean, we talked about the plane crash. I mean, I people say that to me.
00:52:57
I can't I can't do that anymore. People will say, well, you know, there was a plane crash yesterday. So now today, of course, it's not going to crash today. How could that happen? I'm like, that's that's that's bullshit. It's like they happen all the time.
00:53:08
I never return happen all the time. Well, they really don't. They really don't.
00:53:13
But when you're on one, you think, well, why wouldn't it happen? I mean, I guess I never think did I pull the short straw on this? Well, I.
00:53:22
I mean, I don't I don't.
00:53:24
You're more likely to die in a fucking car. Well, I know. And then if I really didn't think it was going to work, I just wouldn't get on. I wouldn't buy a plane ticket.
00:53:31
But it's only once you sit there now, you can almost, like, fly privately and on a major airline because no, I don't think a lot of people are flying right now. I know.
00:53:40
I haven't yet. No, me neither. You kidding me? I'm a fucking New Mexico.
00:53:44
Almost lost my mind. But you stop for gas, but dry it. Well, that but that's not that hazardous now. I mean, that really.
00:53:51
I mean, there was no I didn't when I was driving, I got the needles. California not even out of California before Arizona. Yeah. And I walk in and there was no distancing. Half the people were passing. Oh shit. For talking. I had to piss and I'm like after that I'm like pissing outside, you know.
00:54:08
Well we we pee a lot outside. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Fuck that. Well I know, I know.
00:54:14
But I mean so in that way I suppose we were more used to it because. Yeah.
00:54:19
And now the you know, the idea that your hands are touching her, it's not as it doesn't feel as scary as it was, you know.
00:54:27
Yeah. You know, but you know, you go you got to be it's just like you know what to do, you know what I mean.
00:54:31
Well, I understand, though, you go into those places where it's just too many too many people out there sort of like what is happening. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the album you sent me before the King Kings Mouth album, that was a big Symfony thing, right?
00:54:44
I forget what all I've sent you. So we the Kings mouth is is a big no.
00:54:48
It's part of an art installation. Oh that's right. It was, it was one was with with the symphony.
00:54:52
The symphony one was recorded I think 2016 with the Colorado Symphony.
00:54:58
Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's amazing. It's amazing. Amazing.
00:55:02
I can't imagine for like you like to have that interpreted like that. Who did the score of something like that.
00:55:07
It took a couple of years to sort of organize it. But I mean, luckily there's symphonies around the country that really do it all the time.
00:55:13
So they're kind of, you know, always somebody have to make it a score. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:55:18
I forget the guy's name, but we were we were working with him a lot, you know, how would that feel?
00:55:23
Well, to tell you the truth, I mean, we had done a few things living in Oklahoma City, you know, with the Oklahoma City Symphony and stuff. Yeah.
00:55:32
And it's kind of chaos, you know. The theme, well, they have their way of working, you know, because they they really work every day like a nine to five job, you know, and, you know, we're used to working well. I mean, you know, we're a band and we just work and work and work hard.
00:55:50
They just a bigger band. Not really. I mean, because they're just such a giant ensemble, you know, and and and they and they do lots and lots of music, you know, it's not like I mean, I'm doing just our music. Yeah. You know, I'm not doing everybody's music. I'm just doing my music, you know.
00:56:06
So we spend a lot of time making every detail about it mostly.
00:56:11
I mean, I think you relate to this mostly.
00:56:13
So we're not petrified when we go up there to perform. We feel like we've got this. We've worked on it, we've worked on it and.
00:56:20
Right. And when in doubt, I've got the confetti cannon.
00:56:23
Well, yeah, but, you know, we just work on it right now.
00:56:27
So we sort of feel like, yeah, even if it goes badly, we've done everything we can. Right. You know what I mean. Yeah. But with these orchestras, you know, you just have to work so fast because they're just you're just another thing that they're doing not to dismiss it, but it's like, you know, I used to working fast and they're good and they don't they're not worried about it that much.
00:56:45
And so it's like, oh, my gosh, you know, you're working on something that I want to work on a song for like a week. And they're like, I got 20 minutes.
00:56:52
Like, Oh, my gosh. Yeah, really. So and it's a big ensemble. I mean, you're on a big stage. And where used I mean, we're wimps. You know, we're a rock band, but we have senior monitors, we have floor monitors.
00:57:05
And, you know, you just so you can hear everything that's going right. And then you get there and everything is so quiet you can't really hear, you know what the horn section is playing over over the string section.
00:57:17
Yeah. You know, it's just it's a panic, you know.
00:57:21
But by the time we got to do this thing, this performance at the Big Red Rocks Amphitheater there outside of Denver, we were prepared like this is you know, you're not you're not going be able to tell really what's going on.
00:57:32
But we're going to we're just going to be in the zone and we're going to do it.
00:57:36
And you've been the Red Rock before that plenty of times, but not with the orchestra, you know, playing as you know, just playing as a rock band or whatever.
00:57:42
But so it was it was wonderful. But, you know, it's full of just you don't really know, is this going good or bad or what? And then the audience screams and you think, oh, well, must be I must be going. Then you think like you have to do like anything.
00:57:57
Well, in a way. But you kind of just the insecurity part. I'm sure it amazing.
00:58:02
But then listening to it afterwards and having some time to sort of, you know, hone in on the bits that it's so. Yeah, it's utterly amazing.
00:58:09
It's and then, you know, but it's not it's not the same as listening to it isn't the same as the experience of being there because it's just too I can't imagine. It's like I just find that. I guess I was asking because like when I've been in a symphony space where a symphony is playing, I'm just sort of like, holy.
00:58:26
Oh yeah. No, I like the force of it. Oh, meat, meat, meat. Both of us. Yeah, yeah. It's insane because it's kind of mysterious is how it builds in.
00:58:36
You know, there's all this stuff happening and it's yeah. It's utterly amazing, this music that no one like ten people give a shit about.
00:58:43
You know, it's like it's so profound, like, you know, like I don't understand anything about classical music, but I remember one time it was in New York. I had nothing to do. I was there for a thing. And they just that was across from Lincoln Center. And I was just trying to go over there and see if there's some classical music I can watch. Just anything. Yeah. I don't give a fuck. What what difference is it going to make.
00:59:03
Well, I don't know.
00:59:04
Right. Yeah, yeah. You know, a few of the things like ours ninth or whatever and that would be, that would be me as well.
00:59:11
Yeah. But it was just like a Beethoven thing was, you know, full symphony. I went in and I'm like, what is happening?
00:59:15
Like it was amazing. Of course. Yes. Amazing. I know. It really is. I know. I know.
00:59:20
And it's I and people think it's it's oh, it's that kind of music I would like of it. But when you're there, it's it's we haven't I don't buy the records.
00:59:27
I don't do nothing, you know. But when I go I'm like, you know, like I haven't got I can see this is this is what I mean about your show. It's like, see people would be guarded like, oh yeah I know, I know. Classical music like, oh I don't give a fuck don't you.
00:59:40
But I love it at the same time. I know and like other by the records I have any records like I like I'm trying to do the jazz thing and I'm getting in there, you know, I can I name some guys. I got guys I like what they see as young. Yeah. Yeah I know. Yeah, yeah. And I'm the same way. I'm same way. Yeah. You know. But who are you jazz guys.
01:00:00
Why. It would be the same as everybody. You know, I'd have like most of the Miles Davis stuff, I'd have most of the John Coltrane. I would have some you listening that out there. Shit. Yeah. Yeah. Cecil Taylor. Ornette Coleman. Yeah. Coleman.
01:00:12
Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. I mean not all the Ornette Coleman but Albert Ayler. He ever was Albert Ayler. Yeah. Yeah but but I'm not an expert you know.
01:00:19
Me neither. You know. I know. Twenty guys and there's, there's a hundred thousand. That's exactly that's exactly what I say. Jazz travels deep in the fucking thing about the weird thing about jazz is like to my ears like I can tell the difference between most of the guys that I listen to. Yeah. Yeah. But in the big. Picture, it's like you're it's the same thread. Well, I understand, yeah, with rock and roll, you I, I know those fucking guys know you well.
01:00:42
Some people would probably say the same thing about what we think is like, you know, there's there's the Beatles and the Rolling Stones are like, oh, no, don't they all sound the same.
01:00:50
No, no. Who is that person? But they must they must be maybe someone two generations ago or someone that's, you know, 18 years old.
01:01:01
What country music? Well, the you know, the good country. I mean, what I call the good country music, but not really. I mean, even living in Oklahoma State Fair. Yeah, but we you know, but even at the state fair, they played Led Zeppelin, you know, I mean, I never went to see Led Zeppelin. Didn't play the state fair. No.
01:01:18
But they would just play like Led Zeppelin at the on the rides or the New Mexico State Fair, like, you know, people like Roy Quiet, Buck Owens Willie's way. Yeah. I mean, come through those guys with George Jones.
01:01:28
Yeah. And if it was if it was like one of them or something, but I wouldn't you know, when we were younger we wouldn't have known too many. Too many. I think. I was just wondering if you had in the house or something.
01:01:38
No, I mean my my parents were from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and they, they didn't I mean, we had some music, but not very much. You know, back in the day there was only before anybody had just a bunch of albums. Yeah. You know, growing up. Yeah. We had a few Beatles albums. Yeah. My mother had the Tom Jones records. She had Tom Jones, you know, but not like tons of albums.
01:02:00
No. You know, yeah. My parents had a few here.
01:02:03
Yeah. You know, so this new record, how long did it take you to make it if you take like well it sounds like you're pretty meticulous. I don't know how the process works.
01:02:13
Well, we're lucky because I've a studio at my house and then we always work with Dave Fridmann, our producer, up in his studio up in New York. But we always have like three or four things going on. Yeah. You know, so you're always kind of you know, there's some deadlines are here and some deadlines are far away.
01:02:28
And, you know, the idea that you always are always doing it, I think that's why you're so good at your thing here.
01:02:34
You know what I mean? You're just always doing it. Yeah. And it's not like, man, if we don't get this one right, it's over. It's like, yeah, but I'm just talking to people and staying engaged.
01:02:43
I mean, you got to like you, you're sort of like, can we make that guitar sound different or is this what we're doing?
01:02:50
Well, I mean, yeah, but I mean, I think creative people just like messing around with me. I stay in your songs.
01:02:57
You're engaged with the process. Right? I get what you're saying. I mean, I just I love it. I mean, I clearly I love making records, but I like you make movies and everything. Yeah. I mean, I take babies. Yeah.
01:03:09
You made a fucking baby since the last time. I say when I talk to you, I think you're producing a Keesha record or something.
01:03:15
We had done some stuff with cash or. Yeah. Cash.
01:03:17
Like I said, I don't know who she is.
01:03:20
I don't know one song, you know, I don't know. And I, and I have nothing against him. She's great, but I don't know. Yeah. You know, the kids liked her that I totally understand where you're coming from. Yeah. Like you worked with her and then since then you went through a Miley period it seems. Well, we're actually staying at Miley's one of Miley's houses. That's why I'm here in L.A..
01:03:40
Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm here to hang out with her.
01:03:43
Well, my wife was she's here as well. My wife wanted to come out here for her birthday because she didn't want and this sounds but I'm speaking for so, you know, most of her friends won't listen to.
01:03:57
Yeah. Our show. And you heard me talk. Yeah.
01:04:01
Her friends aren't going to get mad. I think you're going to be OK.
01:04:03
Well, I just know we went to a wedding about a month ago in Bozeman, Montana, and it was outside. Yeah.
01:04:11
And it's breezy and you're kind of in everybody's kind of aware we're going to do mass.
01:04:15
We're going to do the thing, you know, but the fucking reception starts and the DJ's loud. Yeah, people are getting drunk, masks are coming off.
01:04:24
Fuck, you know, and and I'm not saying that. I mean, everybody talking to everybody, but I can tell there's five or six dudes that are here. They got to talk to me. Yeah. You know, they're there or whatever. Yeah. And they're getting drunk and the music is loud.
01:04:39
And that's, you know, that's what the problem is. It's that it's loud and they're going to go right here and nobody but but it's also the problem is like nobody wants to be living like this and everybody there's that part of them. It's sort of like it'll be OK. And it's as soon as you have one cocktail, the. It'll be all right. Yeah. Then you're just fine.
01:04:56
Yeah. Yeah. And especially, you know, to five or six dudes. And so and it is it's awkward.
01:05:02
You and I talked about this walking in. It's awkward because you don't at some point you're like, we've been going for five minutes, but now I don't want to do it. You know, you're like freaks out. I just talked to Gracie Horn and she went to some outdoor party with people she knew. And there's only like six people. And they were just sitting at a table and she freaked out. She had to go, yeah, you know.
01:05:22
Yeah, yeah. So I luckily I had an excuse.
01:05:25
I was going to go back to our Airbnb and check on our little baby and grandmother and stuff.
01:05:30
But part of me was glad that I got to leave because I was like, this is. So we didn't want to have any parties or anything, right? Oh, I see what the point is.
01:05:39
And just to just to you know, and I mean, so many people will want us to do some, especially with her.
01:05:46
And so I think she was like, I'm not going to be here and we'll just be in an isolated house in L.A. And luckily, you know, this house of miles that we're in, it's very isolated. Everybody got tested and even the even the security guards and all that. So so we kind of feel like we're in the right, even though we're, you know, we're traveling around and stuff. I think we're in a good. That's good.
01:06:07
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's good. And you're having a nice time. Oh, it's great. I mean, until now, everybody's works about the fucking fire.
01:06:14
Yeah, I know. It's there's no end to it here. I thought it was going to get out and get away and went to New Mexico and that was on fire. Like I was like I'm just going to go down. Oh, I was.
01:06:23
But your stuff looked great. No, no. By the time I got to Dallas, by the third day, it started to clear up. It wasn't a fire like here. They were just letting it burn off. But it was it was definitely that.
01:06:32
Hey, but there's not I mean, how's it even coming to you, you know, just driving over here.
01:06:37
I mean, the fires right here. No, no, no, no. I mean, they're they're they're closer than I like, but. Yeah, but they're not just up north now. There's one not far right. But in Albuquerque, I was there. I drove up to 2000. They were right outside of Santa Fe and big. But there wasn't a panic there. They were just sort of like no one lives up there. It's hard to get up there.
01:06:56
They're going to let it burn off. But it did fuck the sky up.
01:06:58
Yeah, but so wait, so how old's what's your boy's name is Bloom.
01:07:04
Like a flower. I thought he was a girl for so.
01:07:05
Well I know he kind of looks like a girl if you don't know. Yeah. But, you know, that's, that's here's what is so funny. Like blond hair and. Yeah. He's a beautiful kid. Yeah. Thank you. You started sending pictures of that me. You started texting me pictures of you and that kid like the day after was born and then they, they come sporadically. It's not like you and I text a lot, but every so often a picture will come.
01:07:26
Yeah.
01:07:26
For a while there I was like, is he trying to get me to have a baby. Oh no.
01:07:30
See, I would, I would always I would wonder about that sometimes, you know, but I see what he's doing. He's happy. Right. And he's trying to he's trying to get me to have a baby. Yeah. See, I just sort of feel like this is what I do with texting. I just sort of say, hey, this is what I'm doing. Yeah. No, I mean, like, sure. No, I love him.
01:07:45
I like there I think it was just me having a conversation with myself, but I, I have to have a baby.
01:07:50
I considered that about you. Yeah.
01:07:52
He might be thinking that.
01:07:53
But then I'll send you like some picture of some food or something to some food or you and and a crown. Just anything. Here's what I'm doing. What are you doing?
01:08:00
And that way I'm doing this like Ray's coming out of I. Yeah, yeah.
01:08:03
You know. Yeah, sure. Or part of it saying I'm a lot cooler than you are and here's pictures to prove it.
01:08:10
No, I just, I just think that's the wonder of what you can do now. Exactly.
01:08:15
When you with that, when were you wearing both who you're wearing makeup and you've got a crown on. What was that from you. I don't know. Who was you and some other guy. I don't know if you're blue and one brown. Yeah. Yeah.
01:08:25
That was we did like a Christmas video.
01:08:29
It was just this weird picture of you and makeup with a crowd with it. I'm blue. Yeah. They texted back. I texted about finally.
01:08:37
Well no, I mean that's fine. That's what I do. Yeah. I mean there's no way we would ever just call each other.
01:08:43
Hey what do you do if you do know anybody know. I would I would never even liked it when we did it, you know, but just doing something that takes a second, like it takes you a second back. I know what's going on with Wayne. Yeah, well, let me ask you, though, like.
01:08:56
Yeah. Like, how did this like I mean, have the baby because like it's like I could see that, you know, the experience of it is is profound and that, like you you're you know, you're you're these pictures of you were sort of like holding the baby and even your vanity cannot compete with the love that you have for the baby.
01:09:19
Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think. Did that come off as an insult? No, that's great.
01:09:27
I totally understand that. You know, I think everybody has some level of of a desire to nurture.
01:09:36
I mean, even if you're just you're just with your if it's your friends or your family or whatever, you know. Right.
01:09:40
Deep in you, there must be this. Some people obviously don't have it and they're they're serial killers or whatever.
01:09:47
President. Yeah, you're right.
01:09:53
And and I just don't think you you can ever really satisfy that unless you have an actual baby that, you know.
01:10:02
So I feel like cats don't count all that does. That's why you have dogs and cats and friends and everything, you know, and not the real game until you eat the human baby.
01:10:11
Well, I think having this now, this centralized entity that, you know, without you is not going to it's not you know, it's going to be. Yeah. And like maybe the dogs and cats are the same way, but like your friends and, you know, your family and stuff, you know, they really are going to be fine, you know, but you somehow care about them.
01:10:33
You care. Deeply about them, you want everything to be all right, so I think for me, I think now having an actual baby that, you know, you want to have your energy for and you want to be you know, you want to be awake and smart and be there all the time, I think it just says this is important and these other things aren't that important.
01:10:53
You know, other things, meaning music and all that. No. Yeah, but there's a lot of gaps in when you're doing things that are you know, you're just like, well, I guess if they think it's important, it must be, I'm sure. But now I sort of feel like I can in my mind, I can say this isn't that important to me. I'm not going to sit here. Yeah.
01:11:12
You know, because I got a kid or just to waste your time and waste your energy or to waste your emotional brain on what's interesting now, even with this, with the quarantine or whatever, is for better.
01:11:25
For worse, people are spending a lot more time with their families and their kids. Yeah, I imagine at the age that he's that it's like great. Well, I know I, I hesitate to even say it. I mean, it is great, but I don't like to say because I know so many people are struggling without jobs and their families are sick and all that.
01:11:43
But I know I mean, for us, I mean, this goes back to like the way your show is. You know, it's like this element of time. Hmm. Is it time is part of everything that we do. Everything that we do is like, you know, it's the time that you spend with it is part of the equation. Yeah. But, you know, being a reasonably successful band that gets to travel around the country, play festivals, play shows, get invited to crazy parties, everything, I say yes to everything.
01:12:16
And you just don't have any time. Sure. You know, you end up being on a you're on a plane, you're at a soundcheck, you're doing a show, your hotel.
01:12:23
And all of it on one level is amazing. Sure. But there's just no time to even care that it's amazing. Yeah. I mean, there's times when I would just say I'm just going to sleep on the bus, even though there's a five star hotel right there. I don't want to get up and go in there because it's just another. Yeah, it's just a bed and a toilet. I've got that right here. I mean, I, I would be very thankful that it's all there, but there's just no time to like to appreciate it and assess and take it in.
01:12:52
Yeah. You know, I always say like when you're the best meals you ever have are because you're hungry, not because they're the best meals made by the greatest chefs. Never too much pressure. It's just when you're hungry and you get to eat something good, it's amazing. But if you're not hungry or you've already eaten something, I mean, they can be the best thing ever in front of you. Kind of like, oh, well, you know, and I think a lot of our experiences would be like that, you know, where you are just flying through things so quick.
01:13:24
I know. I notice that, too. Like a lot of the noise has been turned down right now. You know, the pace has changed. Obviously, I'm still doing this, but I I was talking about this this morning about how it's the same with, like what you said about food. There's no science better than the one after noise. Yeah, right. So but I mean, I think that also that I am feeling that as well where it's like because you and I are similar in age and we've been working our whole lives to to to get to where we are and to do what we like to do.
01:13:54
And we continue to do it whether we like it or not.
01:13:57
We do. I love it. No, no, no. I mean, I love it too. Yeah. But when you say yes to everything, you know in your head, it's like this might be a little rougher than the other one, you know, but. But you do it, you know what I mean? Because it's what we do, you know, I say yes.
01:14:11
And sometimes in my mind, I think I hope it doesn't work out, but I have to say yes, sure. Sure. I hope it doesn't suck to that.
01:14:18
Right. So, see, that's your that's why I love your show, because I look, I can't say that, but you can. Yeah, you could if you felt it. But my point is that now that there's literally like you can't even be like, well, where do we got to be? Where's that band going? Who are we playing the bigger room? Why are we in that room?
01:14:37
All those questions, they're on the play because no one's doing.
01:14:40
I know. I know. So there's this. Yes, right.
01:14:44
So the brain is not comparing. The brain is not full of dread or or anticipation of something happening. And he can focus on, you know, the apocalypse and and gratitude. There's this weird mixture of, like, things are scary, the chaos of life. Yeah. Yeah. But here you are with a baby and you're with this wife that you've built for yourself. And you have the time to be grateful.
01:15:07
Absolutely. Absolutely. And knowing that people don't have jobs and I have I have a great, great job that's allowed me, you know, some some leeway here. And and some people aren't very healthy. And I'm I'm. Yeah.
01:15:20
You know, I'm healthier than ever. It's hard. It's a hard place to be. I started crying about that yesterday. I was talking to I was talking to a therapist that comes to my house again, you know, which is, you know, a luxury. But I just. This sort of weird balance of like I didn't think I was going to make it, I didn't think I was going to have a life in this business, I mean, up until I started this podcast, it wasn't looking good.
01:15:44
Yeah, I wasn't making money.
01:15:45
I couldn't sell a ticket. Whatever you mean, as a stand up, whatever. Just I just didn't think I was going to, you know, so be able to even live in my house anymore.
01:15:53
So now here I am. Everything worked out, you know, a lot of ways. And now, you know, we've got the plague, we've got the apocalypse. You know, I'm experiencing tragedy. But like, I have to still realize that I'm alive. And there's a lot to be grateful for. And a lot of people are suffering. And I have to balance, like, how do I, you know, continue to be empathetic with my with with also experiencing gratitude, but also carrying a certain amount of fear and pain.
01:16:17
It's tricky shit.
01:16:19
Well, I think you handle it. Amazing if you ask me. I hear you talk about it because that's you you you're able to talk about it and you talking about it. It made me feel like, man, you know. Yeah. You made me feel good about all the stuff I even feel good about, like what's happening to you. And so I don't know. I think that's just part of the thing. But I think with the baby, though, I got to assume, man, that like, you know, on any given day just to look at that, like, look, I'm not I don't think I don't I don't I'm not I think I need a kid.
01:16:55
Right. Right. But I do understand more as time goes on the sort of joy and focus that like despite everything else being what it is and the chaos in the world, whatever the amount of love that transpires between, you know, you and your kid and your wife and around this family unit has got to be just. Well, yeah, he has to embrace everything.
01:17:14
Well, I mean, when he's when he's there in his moment, I mean, you just that's it's easy to see.
01:17:20
I'm idealising I'm forgetting about the part where you're going like, God, when is this going to stop?
01:17:25
No, I don't think that. I mean, I think I would have if when I was younger, you know, I think I'm very lucky that it's happened to me in my late 50s.
01:17:33
And I I feel like I've for me, I kind of feel like this is my third life.
01:17:39
You know, there was my life before I got laid on the floor at Long John Silvers. And then I that was my I got to live my second life. I said, fuck it, I'm going to do your music. I'm going to do art and do this thing. And now I feel like I'm living like a third life. Yeah.
01:17:54
You get to do you know the father.
01:17:56
But see, I think what I see in you is that, you know things. You understand things. It's not, hey, I'm smart. It's like I've lived and I've been I've been able to observe and listen. And so this what's happening in the world, you can say it is bad. And I understand it's it's horrible for some people, but it's not that horrible for me. And even though these horrible things are happening to you, I feel I would feel the same way.
01:18:22
It's like my pain isn't it's not the same type of pain because I'm I'm optimistic still. You are. Even when all this stuff is on you, you know, you're optimistic guy.
01:18:35
You seem to be.
01:18:35
I think so. I think that's the thing that we became aware of when we made this record in 1999, the soft-boiled and record.
01:18:42
I think we just never considered that we were we thought we were going to make a record and just be like the world's miserable.
01:18:50
I told you, the world is dark and people are you know, I'm really sorry, but you felt like you were that kind. I maybe I didn't listen to your earlier records close enough, but there was always sort of an uplift to it.
01:19:00
Yeah, I but I didn't I thought, well, we're going to we're going to sing what's in our hearts or whatever, you know, whatever you sure.
01:19:07
And if, if we're just bitter old fools. Yeah. Well so be it.
01:19:11
Yeah. You got you know. Yeah. But then I would hear you made a break dude. I was like you go after softball and it's sort of like why I don't have to be bitter for a while.
01:19:21
Well I, we weren't actually bitter. It just we sort of felt like maybe we got to I don't know, I think we always envied rock stars that were kind of like miserable or something.
01:19:32
Yeah, but you guys pop though, right? So. Yeah, but, you know, it's like I guess like but no one seems to do it like you guys do. It's a weird thing when I see pictures, somebody this morning said I when I said you were going to come over, someone said he's going to come in above.
01:19:45
Well, I would have. I would have. I you know, I mean, I've done that.
01:19:51
Everything you do, though, you guys do is sort of surrounded with this weird kind of, you know, creativity. Like, you know, you paint, you do the bubbles, you make the movies. Yeah. It's a it's like it's sort of a kind of it's a psychedelic legacy. It's the next step into this, you know, otherworldliness. So I think that once you I don't know how much of you really lives there, but it seems like a part of you does.
01:20:17
Well, that's just what creative people like. You know, they like having that some because some creative people are making things with saws. I mean. Yeah. And you're making things with bubbles. I would do well. I would do it with anything. I mean, I think that's what happened.
01:20:31
I mean, I, I buy buy midsize. I mean, I'm not saying is a. What I'm saying is that there's a dark creativity and then there's this thing that you do well, yeah, yeah, yeah, well, I think I'm very lucky in that way. Yeah.
01:20:41
That it's sort of like no matter what you think, that's where your creativity goes well away from the darkness. I don't I don't think intentionally.
01:20:50
I think it's sort of like, you know, there's been some sad songs or you just follow whatever it is that you feel. Right. And I forget there's been there has been some sort or some heavy themes with the robots and whatnot. Heavy, but still optimistic, I think.
01:21:03
I think that's the thing that we we we learned about ourselves is like just doing music and doing art and doing it and doing it. And then at some point, I mean, do you ever listen to, like, your old shows?
01:21:14
Yeah, I know, but like, I've watched myself doing standup. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:21:17
You know, and we would when you're in the middle of making it, it's hard to tell.
01:21:22
Is this good or bad, stupid or amateur or whatever, you know, but when you when you can kind of get removed from it.
01:21:27
Yeah, I sometimes think I listen to some of our older records. Some of them are very old now, you know, 25, 30 years ago and amazing. And I'm just like, I, I, I love them.
01:21:38
I'm like these dudes, they're going, you know, I found that to because, like, I they're not records. But I you know, I used to think like when I was younger, I wasn't me yet, that I hadn't developed into me.
01:21:50
And then I watch this shit from like the late 80s and I'm like, wow, I was me. Wow. I just wasn't confident.
01:21:55
And I didn't you know, I didn't have the wisdom. I didn't have yeah. I wasn't comfortable with myself, but I'm definitely me. Yeah. And my brain is the same and the way I'm talking is the same. And what I'm thinking about it isn't this is the same. It just wasn't there yet.
01:22:09
Wow. But me. Do you feel like you're there now.
01:22:13
Sure I do. I feel like that. I feel like that about you. Yeah. I like that about you. Did you feel like when you were did you feel like did you think of yourself as not being there yet or did you always think we were there in the world you needed to catch up?
01:22:25
I only in the past, you know, like maybe five or six years, you sort of feel like. Exactly.
01:22:31
And part of you just doesn't want to be done yet. You know, you don't want to say, well, here I am. This is what I do. I you know, I still want to do a billion.
01:22:39
I guess that's true, you know, but like but but there is something to be said about, like the fearlessness of being there. Like, it's not so much I'm done. Like, I know that the last two specials I did were the best work I've done. So if you can see that evolution like this is really like I'm on top of this and I have a little room to play.
01:22:56
Yeah, that's it. Exactly. Yeah.
01:22:57
Yeah, yeah. Right. But maybe it was someone on your show, even one of your shows said, you know, when you have a little bit of success, you feel like you're kind of you're greased up.
01:23:07
It's easier to do things because you can kind of I mean, even me being able to just text you and say, hey, I'm coming out there, can I be on the show?
01:23:17
I mean, it's like it's like the greatest thing ever. And I'm just texting you about it, you know what I mean? So in that way, there's probably 10000 dudes that would want to be sitting here that we wish they could text you and say, hey, I'm going to be in town, you know?
01:23:31
Well, some people are like, why don't you interview normal guy, just a regular guy. I imagine it's going to have to happen at some point.
01:23:39
No, I think you would find, no matter who you're talking to, go find interesting. Of course, you know. Yeah, but I mean, so for me, it's that I think you feel like you've got a little bit of leeway.
01:23:48
Yeah.
01:23:48
And obviously you're you're taking risks doing what you want and you're honing in on what really works and what satisfies you.
01:23:55
And I don't know. I don't know.
01:23:57
And we could still very well lose our minds in the next couple of years and never do it again. I mean, you know, part of you doesn't really know why.
01:24:05
That's the other thing I learned about this time, this quarantine time. It's sort of like I saved a little money, I think probably enough to get me through the rest of my life.
01:24:12
And there's part of me that sort of like, you know, what if I don't if we don't get to do anything again, I do that.
01:24:17
Right. Well, that's man, that's great coming from you. That's amazing, right? Yeah, I can.
01:24:23
I can. I don't know if I'm going to beat those last two specials and I don't know if any of us are going to ever be the same again. So if that's the last because like, I'm in no hurry to do stand up and fucking Drive-Ins, do you understand?
01:24:34
Like there's. Yeah, no I totally understand that. Yeah.
01:24:37
You mean like, I mean what's going to happen. How do we perform what you know what happens now and what is what is what is the point of reference right now.
01:24:44
Whatever we end up, you know, if everything works out a little bit and we get through this, you know, it's going to be a different world.
01:24:52
It's going to be a post-Cold War world, and it's going to be like it's a whole different sensibility. It's a paradigm shift of existence.
01:24:58
Well, I think that's where we don't know which way to hedge their bets. Is it absolutely different from now on? We never go back to being in a crowded, sweaty room where people are screaming at each wonder.
01:25:09
We don't know, maybe you and I don't.
01:25:12
But I don't know if someone that's twenty is going to say I'll, you know, give a fuck, you know, I mean, I don't know, you know, or does is this the beginning of.
01:25:22
Well, they started to have a place to go. I mean, even if you're twenty, you know, give a fuck, you know, the club's got to be open. Exactly. Yeah.
01:25:30
Well, that's what I keep telling people as well. It's like, you know, I don't. No, if we I mean, I speak to you right now, I'm not sure when this will air, you know, but it's like I have 100 of these these space bubbles that I go in over the crowd.
01:25:45
Yeah, 100 of a 100 of them were on the way to my house.
01:25:48
Well, they're on the way to my house now.
01:25:50
OK, they just got manufactured in China, OK? And they're on the way to my house in a couple of days. And so I saw the sketches. It's the concert idea.
01:26:00
Well, you know, it started off as a as just a silly cartoon about, you know, you could do a concert at the beginning of March.
01:26:08
You know, we're all like, well, you know, this is funny sort of or, you know, and then the sketch of you performing in a bubble in the audience being about right.
01:26:18
Right. The Flaming Lips of 2000 nineteen right there. I'm on stage and I'm in I'm in the bubble. And it's just a normal concert. And 2020, everybody and everybody in the band and myself and the audience were all in a bar. And you're like, wait a minute.
01:26:31
Well, well, right at the beginning of the recording, it's still a pandemic.
01:26:37
I don't know if it was a pandemic when it started, but. But the people at The Stephen Colbert Show, right. Said, Hey, would you guys be interested in doing one of these?
01:26:47
Now, we know they're called home concerts, you know, but even then, we're like, yeah, you're just going to kind of do a do a video and then we'll air it. Right. That's the way the show is going to be for a while.
01:26:57
For the rest of time.
01:27:00
Right. I mean, at the time, I think we were thinking another couple of weeks or something, you know. Yeah. And and they were the ones that suggested this. Could we make this this cartoon come to life just for like the this the Stephen Colbert Show? Yeah. And I was like, yeah, let's sure.
01:27:16
Let's see what we can do.
01:27:18
They helped me get some of the space bubbles. I had a few, but I have that many. And they're coming from China, so I got a few and they helped us get quite a few more.
01:27:27
And we did this show good that the that the president hasn't stopped your space bubbles coming from China.
01:27:33
Well, we're not going to even talk about it. Yeah, you know, that's the way that's the way I operate.
01:27:39
Like, look, I'm I'm not asking permission, you know, but we got them. And, you know, even even when we got that, we still didn't know how long is this going to be going right or is it just going to be right?
01:27:52
We'll all be over, whatever. So we did this concert just like four songs with twenty seven of us all in bubbles. Oh, wow.
01:28:03
And it's it's ridiculous. But I mean, it it does work. I mean, I guess that's the part of it that's like. Well yeah. I mean you, you can breathe and you're separated and all that sort of stuff. That absolutely works. But we thought it was not really going to do this.
01:28:19
Right. And now, you know, it's we're going into like people are talking about not till next summer are we really thinking about trying concerts. And I'm like, well, I don't know if some of these places will survive till then. I mean, the places we're talking about I remember the Cain's ballroom in Tulsa. I mean, it's it's famous because, I mean, we live in Oklahoma, but it's one of the it's it's the only building left standing that the Sex Pistols played in 1977.
01:28:47
Oh, wow. Yeah.
01:28:48
But these are the types of venues that, you know, another six or seven months are going to disappear.
01:28:54
They're going to disappear. But like structurally, they're not going to disappear. It's not like buildings are going to disappear. It's businesses will disappear. But like, you know, I don't know. I understand, like, I know all these and it's terrible. And I want all the venues to come back. But it's not like there's somebody waiting to go in. I don't know why they you know what I mean? Like, yeah, yeah. Y y you can't like I guess you can't but like it's just the idea of because there's, you know, people work there and it's all terrible.
01:29:21
But I mean, why can't you just put these, all this stuff in an induced coma like they have the rest of the economy. It's not like landlords can stop charging people.
01:29:30
Well, yeah, I think you're right. I mean, it takes a big corporation. I'm saying, OK, you know, all these things that we were, you know, going to be paying out every month, we're going to stop that. But it's not like that.
01:29:40
Yeah. Yeah. You know, and I think these places are just they've they've been made in the sort of way of like it's a lot of people crammed together drunk as fuck. Yeah. Music is loud. Best thing ever. Yeah. Used to be anyway. Yeah. You know. And is that all going to change. So a place that used to hold like 1500 people packed. Now is it only going to be a couple hundred people. How is that going to work.
01:30:04
How are you going to make any money or.
01:30:05
Yeah I know, I guess I you know, I get it.
01:30:07
So I sort of saying we're we're going to try to do shows with the space bubbles only as a way of saying this is the way I am trying to do something. If everybody out there tries to do something, maybe we'll really come up with the solution instead of waiting and saying, well, we're just going to wait till goes back to normal because there might not be a normal to go back to.
01:30:30
It may not ever happen. And there may be. Another virus that comes there may be 10 more waiting for us. Great, you know, I hope not yet.
01:30:40
Yeah, but this could just be the beginning of the new world. Yeah, adapting. And just. Matt, it's so. Yeah, yeah. It's a sad reality, but people do adapt. And I'll try to hold on to some of your optimism, so.
01:30:53
Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, standing in front of you, I have to say, you know, you do have that about you.
01:31:00
I think, you know, that's part of what makes you funny is that you really are moving ahead, trying things, wanting things to work, loving the world. And you've got that shelter of being like, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, you know.
01:31:15
Yeah, but but in front of you, you're you're great. Yeah. You're giving me a lot of hope, OK? Yeah. Yeah. I'm not I'm not dragging everything down into a hole with me is what you're saying.
01:31:28
Well, that's good. That that means somehow or another over the years or whatever I'm going through, I don't know where I took the turn, but but yeah, man, you know, it has to do with sort of like well let's let's make the best of it. Right.
01:31:41
Well, when you started to do the podcast. Yeah. That's bad time. That was you saying I've, I, I've got to do something.
01:31:48
No, I was like, you know, I was in trouble. I just gone through that fucking second divorce. I was going broke. I couldn't sell tickets. You know, I literally thought like, well, I'm never going to be a big comic. I'm never going to do movies, I'm never going to do TV. And like, I don't know how I and like the idea of being just sort of a broom, you know, like, I couldn't take it.
01:32:13
So I was like, really suicidal. And we. You mean. You mean really. Well, I mean, I don't think I would ever do if I didn't have any solutions. Right. Right. And so it was really this weird Hail Mary pass with no expectations because I'd done some radio. I mean, the guy who still produced it to show me my business partner, you know, put made this thing. We did this with not knowing anything.
01:32:33
And it's just it was the thing that turned everything around.
01:32:35
But what was why? I mean, whose idea was it to do this, like a podcast podcast back then?
01:32:42
We're still like, well, I'll tell you, I we had just done something. I just done a streaming video show long before anyone was watching those. And it tanked. And I was working for a company, Air America, and they fired us. And we still had a month on the deal. And they let us stay in the office and they had radio studios. So I knew that Carole and Jimmy Pardo and a few other people were doing podcasts like comics.
01:33:04
I'm like, let's can we try this? Can you figure out how to put it up and what we got to do? And he said, yes, and we just committed to doing a new show every Monday and Thursday. And and and that's what we did. And we started there in the studio in New York. And then I moved out here and started doing it in my garage. And we've done a new show without missing one since September 2009.
01:33:25
Wow. Wow. And it was because you kind of well, we got this place where we always try and we got the equipment.
01:33:34
We can go in there late at night, know, and just hijacked the place and figure out what we're doing and figure out what the show is. And then we kind of evolved into a show where I invited people I knew over to talk about my problems, basically.
01:33:46
And that's it. Still is. I I'm here to help you. You have. Yeah, you have. And I appreciate.
01:33:54
I mean, that's so that is so punk rock and you felt like it worked.
01:34:00
Well, it's like we didn't know what was up, you know, like at the beginning, you know, there was no way to make money. So I was offering people swag. You know, if they if they sent me some money, I'd send them a T-shirt and a sticker like a fucking houseful of stickers and T-shirts and packing envelopes. And, you know, we had one advertiser was like Adam and Eve, sex toys and shit.
01:34:19
I mean, I know we know about your podcast. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Was popular in vans, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:34:25
Musicians have kind of figured it out but you so you did it and you thought we had no we had no expectations. I just knew that I needed to stay engaged and I knew that like I knew that I was OK on this type of music and I knew that I could, you know, do it. But like so many things evolved and happened and you know how it got traction. But it took a while for any of us to sort of figure out how we can make a living at it.
01:34:49
Yeah. And then, like so even though it's succeeding, in a sense, you know, how we got all these people, how do we get them to give us money? Yeah. And that sort of evolved the model. Like there was a community of us that came on around the same time and, you know, before everyone was doing a podcast and we figured some stuff out. But it all kind of there was a community vibe that evolved.
01:35:08
And, you know, now, like, you know, it's you know, I still love it. I still get I love it in the sense that, like, I'm nervous and anxious and don't know what the fuck is going to happen every time I talk to somebody. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just don't know. Yeah.
01:35:23
And like, some days I'm like, fuck, what am I going to do with that guy? Because you don't you don't know them or you don't.
01:35:30
I don't know most of these people. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So you don't know what's going to. I mean, I've listened to some of your shows where I know you know a lot about them and then I've listened to somewhere you don't know anything about them.
01:35:40
And I mean, that's that's where you're you're just going to go for it. That's what's so inspiring. You're like, yeah, here we go. He's sorry for jumping off the mountain every time. I mean, I just like talking to you, you know. Sorry. Yeah.
01:35:54
So now let's go out into the raining ash. Is it is it ash?
01:35:58
But it really is just from grass fires and stuff, right? It's not like volcano or something.
01:36:02
Right. I've been I've been in volcano ash.
01:36:05
Is it somehow better that it's just half the state burning and not a volcano?
01:36:09
Well, it didn't seem. I mean, you know, I went to Oklahoma where there's tornadoes and shit all the time.
01:36:14
I never I never consider like that. It's that. Have you seen them up close, the tornadoes? I never have. See, this is the this is the ridiculous thing. It's like the first time I was in Canada, I saw the fucking northern lights. Oh, that's nice. I know. And I'm talking to guys like I've lived here my whole life. I've seen them. Right. I've lived in Oklahoma my whole life. I've never seen a real tornado.
01:36:36
Oh, I know. I want to go chase one down. Well, got you. Can I don't know. You don't know. You can. But I mean, I know I kind of that's not the job you need to take. Well I would feel stupid now if I went and chased one and then got paralyzed or I know of being but I know when they're happening, I'll drive down the road to see them.
01:36:53
Maybe someday it'll just come down your street. Oh well I, I kind of wanted to but kind of not but it'll probably come down at night and I wouldn't be able to see it or something.
01:37:02
Yeah. You know that's the big fear. Yeah. But dogs bark the tornado. It's not going to go away is it.
01:37:09
Well we have we have a good we have the best weather guys ever. You know, they can tell you if it's on your block or not. It's insane. So yeah.
01:37:18
Well hopefully no tornadoes but someday maybe you'll see one. I hope so. Or maybe you in fact, similar. Maybe you can make one at one of your concerts. It may be the next thing, man. People in space shuttles twirling around. Man man in a vortex of air. Yeah. Yeah. So now I'm just pitching ideas guzzi anyway. You too. I love you. I love you man.
01:37:36
Yeah. That was Wayne Coyne talking to me here in the garage behind some plexiglass. The album is American Head. It's the 16th album, the 16th studio album from the band Flaming Lips. You can get it now wherever you get music. Oh, yeah, I did. I should tell you about this. I did. I did a panel thing with the cast of Gwo. It was something that it had something to do with registering voters. And, you know, part of the deal is we do this panel.
01:38:10
I think it's available on YouTube somewhere. I know that's vague, but he turned out to be a very emotional and kind of a cathartic thing for a lot of us because we didn't know when we took the gig or when we did the service of registering people to vote and then to do the pound that we were going to be canceled. So it was not a happy cast of Gwo per say, but it was a reflective and somewhat sad cast of Gwo.
01:38:33
You know, talking about the show, it was, it was an interesting thing and a touching thing to watch. All right, so take care of yourself, mind your mind so they don't mind your mind. Now play some guitar similar to other guitar I've played at other times.
