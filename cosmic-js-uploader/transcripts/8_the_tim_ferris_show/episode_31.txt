He writes daily at Seth's DOT blog, which is one of the most popular blogs in the world and has been for decades.
00:00:36
I would imagine at this point he is also the founder of the alt MBA and the Akimbo workshops, online seminars that have transformed the work of thousands of people. He writes about the post-industrial revolution, the ways ideas spread, marketing quiting leadership and most of all, changing everything. His newest book is the practice subtitle Shiping Creative Work. You can find him online at Seth's blog or Seth Godin Dotcom. He's on Twitter, but he's not an active tweeter.

This episode is brought to you by PornHub, just kidding. This episode is brought to you by for Stigmatic, which is part of my morning routine, also part of my afternoon routine routine saves me. So there are a number of ways that I use for stigmatic in the mornings. I regularly start with their mushroom coffee instead of regular coffee, and it doesn't taste like mushroom.
00:01:38
Let me explain this. First of all, zero sugar, zero calories, half the caffeine of regular coffee. It's easier. My stomach tastes amazing and all you have to do is add hot water.
00:01:50
I use travel packets. I've been to probably a dozen countries with various products from four stigmatic and their mushroom coffee is top of the list. That's number one. I travel with it. I recommend it. I give it to my employees, I give it to house guests. So if you're one of the 60 percent of Americans or more who drink coffee daily, consider switching it up. The stuff is amazing. That's part one. That is the cognitive enhancement side.
00:02:18
Easy on the system side, energizing side. The next is actually their Chagga tea, which taste delicious. It is decaf, completely decaf. And some may recognize Chagga. It is nicknamed the King of the Mushrooms. It is excellent for immune system support. So needless to say, I am focused on that right now myself. And so I will often have that in the afternoons. They make all sorts of different mushroom blends. If you are doing exercises, I am on a daily basis to keep myself sane cordyceps, excellent for endurance.
00:02:53
They have a whole slew of options that you can check out. Every single batch is third party lab tested for heavy metals allergens, all the bad stuff to make sure that what gets into your hands is what you want to put in your mouth.

This episode is brought to you by Tonle Toenail. I'm super excited about this one and I was skeptical of it in the beginning. Tonal quote, Tonal is the world's most intelligent home gym and personal trainer, end quote. That's the tagline from their website, folks, to give you the one sentence summary. And this device, it's really a system is perfect for anyone looking to take their home workouts to the next level or someone who just wants to get maximum bang for the buck.
00:04:20
In a tiny, tiny footprint of space, Total is precision engineered to be the world's most advanced strength studio and personal trainer. It uses breakthrough technology of all different types to help get you stronger, faster. I was introduced to total by three different friends. All of them are tech savvy. One of them is a former competitive skier who's doubled his strength in a number of moments using total, even though he has a long athletic background. And I'll paint a picture for you by eliminating traditional metal weights, dumbbells and barbells, Total can deliver 200 pounds of resistance, which doesn't sound like a lot, but it's actually it feels like a lot more at the high end in a device smaller than a flat screen TV.
00:04:59
And you can perform at least 150 different exercises. And these different technologies are exclusive to tunnel. And you can dial weights up and down with the touch of a button in one pound increments using magnets and electricity. So the movement is extremely smooth. And even though I have a home gym already in my garage, I'm still getting a total installed. I've used total for multiple workouts now to do things I just cannot do in my home gym, such as the chopping lift exercises from the four hour body, all sorts of cable exercises that would usually involve much, much bigger piece of equipment centric training.
00:05:37
For instance, you can do to give a simple example, bicep curls where you are lifting, let's just say twenty pounds in each hand up and then total will automatically increase the weight because you can lower more than you can lift to, say, 25 or 30 pounds on the way down. And I do kettlebell swings, I do all sorts of deadlifts. This, that the other thing. And after one workout Octonal focusing on pulling, I was blasted for a full week.
00:06:04
It's really incredible what you can do with eccentrics. They also have all sorts of other really, really cool advantage that you can apply to any of your favorite movements. Tonal learns from your strength and provides suggested weight recommendations for every move with detailed progress reports to help you see your strengths grow. Tonal also has a growing library of expert led workouts by motivating coaches from strength training to cardio. So you could do really just about everything.

At this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. Can I ask you a question now at the scene in. I'm a cybernetic organism, living tissue, metal, and was made in Paris, so. Seth, welcome to the show. Thank you, Tim, it's great to talk to you and I thought we would start we're all good things start and that is the etymology of the word hack, which you introduced me to.
00:07:49
So what does this word hack and what context would you like to provide?
00:07:54
So many ways to dig into this. So here's the deal. When London was smaller on the outskirts of London was a borough called Hackney, and Hackney was a place where they would raise horses. They didn't raise thoroughbreds. They didn't raise extraordinary show horses. They raised just average horses, average horses at an average price. And so if you got to Hackney Horse, you probably did it because you were, I don't know, a handsome cab driver. And that's where your nickname came as being a hack in that you didn't have a special horse.
00:08:25
You simply had a horse. There's nothing wrong with raising a hack, there's nothing wrong with buying a hack, being a hack is about giving the customer exactly what they want at a decent price. However, it is important to distinguish it from the magic fraught topic of our art of that thing that lights us up the work that we actually want to do. And so my book, The Practice, is about that gap between being a hack, selling as if you're a hack, and the other thing, which is the generous act of doing something magic of leading.
00:09:09
And it really bothers some people to hear their work described as hack work. But I think there's nothing wrong with it. You should own it because you need to distinguish it from that other work you can do. Now you're talking about something that bothers other people. I want to talk for a minute or five about things that bother you. So one of my favorite aspects of our conversations, to give a little slice of life for people, I picked up a book because I erroneously thought you had recommended to me.
00:09:39
It came up on the podcast somewhere else. I shan't name it unless you would like to, but I picked up this book. I really love the introduction of the first Chapter two, and I prematurely sent the text to Self, implying that I was impressed with this book he had recommended.
00:09:52
And not too far thereafter we had dinner. We sat down and you're like, Tell me about this book, because I could not disagree more with everything in these pages.
00:10:01
Effectively, I'm paraphrasing, so I like how direct you are. You do not mince words when it comes to opinions that that you've formed. And I would love to know what other commonly used words or phrases bother you, whether it's the concepts of the words themselves or how they are wielded. Right. Because in this case, you're taking your word hack and you're going back to the roots and your contextualizing it and showing that it can be a neutral or positive thing, not just a derisive term.
00:10:34
Are there any other terms, phrases, concepts that are bandied about that that bother you?
00:10:41
Well, there are a couple that I find really useful to question. And one is the way we interchange learning and education, and the other one is the way we play with the word quality. So I'm happy to start with either one, but quality might make an easier place to go.
00:11:00
Let's go to quality. OK, so quality, if you want to be a perfectionist, is a great way to hide because you don't want to be an enemy of quality. That when someone says why can't ship this yet? Because the quality isn't there. When someone says, why are you racing through that? Don't you want to put quality into it? Well, we're defenseless in the face of that. And so someone doesn't want to ship their work is going to stand behind perfectionism.
00:11:27
But perfectionism has nothing to do with perfect and perfect, doesn't have a lot to do with quality. So quality has a very specific definition. It comes from Edwards, Deming and the rest of the quality movement of the forties and fifties, the people who gave us the Toyota.
00:11:42
And what it means is meets spec. That's it meets spec.
00:11:49
And so if I said, what's a better quality car, a Toyota Corolla or a Rolls Royce, the answer is a Toyota. Because Toyota meets spec, it more reliably does exactly what it's supposed to do when it's supposed to do it, then Rolls Royce does a Rolls Royce is a different thing. It's luxury. It's ostentatious spending of resources to create something most people can't have. And that's a fine thing to if you want it. And that kind of quality is also worth chasing, if that's what you wanted.
00:12:21
But it's easy to show that high fashion goods, luxury purses, things that we would say have quality don't actually last as long as something from RCI. So again, back to meetings back then, the third definition of quality is the magic of magic. So in in the book I talk about the industry in Hamilton and West Side Story. Most people have never seen them on Broadway.
00:12:46
Hamilton is famous because something changes in a lot of people in the audience when they see what Lin Manuel built, on the other hand. West Side Story cost a fortune. The tickets were four hundred bucks, the projection screen was the best I'd ever seen and nobody remembers what happened on stage because the quality of magic wasn't there. Hmm, what do you mean by magic or how would you describe that magic to someone who. Is in prison, what what is the magic?
00:13:20
So if we go to the colloquial understanding of magic, someone who does a coin trick where it disappears from one hand, it's just gone for a moment. We feel real tension and it's the tension of that couldn't happen. And that happened at the same time. One know how the trick is done, it's simply a trick, the magic evaporates and in the case of great writing, great customer service, great theater, the first time you experience it, the unexpected moment when lights turn on for you.
00:13:56
I want to call that magic. So if you've ever been inside of Richard Sarah sculpture, DIA Beacon, it's a two million pound piece of steel. If I showed you a sketch of it, you wouldn't get the joke. But if you saw in real life, something would change in you if you understood the genre and what came before, etc.. So I believe that now that we've got AI and robots and offshoring and the rest. The work that's left for us is the work to create magic.
00:14:27
How do you think maybe this is a bad question, but Lin Manuel Miranda and his team do that in Hamilton more effectively? Is it an unusual combination of elements? Of course it is. I mean, in many respects I've seen the show. What else is there to that experience or that that piece of art, that product in in your mind? So I was talking to someone the other day about this and they were talking about the fact that they were eager to make some sort of creative magic, but they were just waiting for a really good idea.
00:15:03
I said, you mean a really good idea, like a multimillion dollar Broadway musical based on an obscure Revolutionary War character with the entire cast played by people who aren't traditionally cast in those roles and a soundtrack sort of based on rap and hip hop like that kind of really great idea.
00:15:19
Not a really great idea. Right. And it doesn't work because when you read the paragraph about it or even if you read Chernow's book, it was obvious that this was a good idea. Good idea, because it is a series of moments that create tension and then relieve it. It is based on a mixing of several genres by someone who really, truly understands them. So the things that happened in Hamilton rhyme with the things that came before. If you're a fan of Broadway, you notice things that fit in, even though you're surprised that they do.
00:15:58
If you're a fan of rap or hip hop, you notice things that fit in, even though you might be surprised that they do. He makes references in every single line to some giant who came before. And so that texture grabs people who have cultural awareness. And then he takes you every few minutes to a place where you're not sure it's going to work. And then he leaves the tension and starts the process over again. And it's easy to hear this rant and think, well, that only happens in a good Broadway show.
00:16:33
But I would argue it happens at a fine restaurant dinner that you're going to remember. And it can also happen at a business meeting because we're humans. And that's the roller coaster that informs how we remember the world you described just moments ago, how people can hide behind the word quality or use it as a means of postponing action. It's a bit of an unfair trump card that can be used really effectively to not engage, to not take take risk.
00:17:08
There's a I want to say a corollary of sorts to that that I wouldn't mind. I wouldn't mind. I would like if you could just reiterate for folks we've spoken about it before and that is kind of hiding behind the big hiding behind creating something gigantic or affecting a billion people, et cetera. Could you speak to that? Because I think this is this is closely related. And then I have a follow up, completely related.
00:17:32
We live in a crazy moment in time and we're also in political season. And part of it is where is the person on a white horse in shining armor who's going to come fix everything? And if we read the traditional business media, the folks who are lionized are running public companies, changing the fabric of our culture, racking up billions and billions of dollars as if that's the only sort of success that matters. And you almost never read a story about a kindergarten teacher like Lenny Levine, who changed the lives of 20 kids by showing up day after day.
00:18:11
You can't say you can't play. And now, 20, 25 years later, after Lenny has passed away, those kids are passing on that message to other kids. But we don't write articles about that. And one of the things I've been arguing is that the smallest valuable audience is more attainable than ever before, that it didn't used to be possible as Kevin Kelly would talk about a thousand true fans. Impossible. But, you know, if you run an HVAC, small business, two hundred customers is plenty.
00:18:41
And, you know, I am super pleased with how my books have done. But ninety nine percent of the people in America have never read a book I wrote. Ninety nine percent plenty find the smallest possible audience means you're on the hook, because if you are specific about who it's for, then that group gets to say, you made me a promise. You didn't keep it. Whereas if you say I have this big shiny idea, but this v.C won't fund me or this media company won't write about me or Oprah will call.
00:19:12
Now, you have a great excuse.
00:19:18
All right.
00:19:18
So I'm going to personalize this selfishly because that is my nature of trying to flash back.
00:19:25
Now, I'm going to create a montage of dinners with Seth. This is this is just a portion of our exchange in the last dinner, same dinner where I misattributed this book to you as a recommendation where I asked you for advice. Because I was feeling stuck with writing and you're very, very observant, Ali replied.
00:19:48
Didn't we talk about that eight months ago, the last time we had dinner? And I said, yes, indeed we did. It shows you how little progress I've made and whether this is just an opportunity to showcase my insecurities, I don't know. But I would love to hear what you think it is that I torture myself with or that tortures me. That leads me to ask you these types of. Repeated questions on different occasions, because you are as much as anyone I know, you seem from the outside looking in and maybe it's like the calm duck on the surface kicking like hell under water.
00:20:26
I don't know. You seem to be a relatively conflicted person. You're not, like, biting your nails, fretting about doing A or B, you seem to pretty calmly do your thing and I wouldn't describe myself that way. So in what you've seen, is there is there any sort of outside perspective where you're like? I think that these are some of the reasons Tim gets tied up in knots. Is there anything that you have to.
00:20:52
OK, well, first of all, if I'm making you miserable, then I apologize. It's certainly. No, no, no, no, you're not. No, I love our dinners. So I think that this is just way great conversation left out. The thing I said after I said the thing about eight months, which is. Where's your bad writing? And there's no such thing as writer's block. Writer's block is real, but it does not exist.
00:21:15
What it really is, is misnamed. I have a fear of bad writing. I have a fear of what the world will say when it encounters my bad writing. And the way through is to do your bad writing, you don't have to ship it to the world, but you have to do the bad writing. And bad writing over time, if you do enough of it can't persist, good writing will slip through. And I learned this from Isaac Asimov.
00:21:45
He and I worked together on a project years ago. He published four hundred books back when it was hard to publish a book for one hundred books. And he told me that every morning, sorry, that's the volunteer fire department. Every morning for six hours he would sit and type and it didn't matter if it was good or not. He had to do six hours of typing. Now, obviously, he didn't have a typing problem. Just about anybody can do six hours typing and then at the end of the shift, he would look throughout the bad writing, whatever was left, what was left in the subconscious.
00:22:18
Understood that if he's going to type anyway, you might as well typed something good. So he got through the bad writing thing. And in your case, you have so much skill and such a benefit of the doubt from people you've earned it from, that it's really likely that you're saying, why do I need to get back into that? There's nothing but downside for me, because you know how to make one of the world's best podcasts. You do it on the regular people really like it.
00:22:50
When you write a book. They roll their eyes and read the whole thing. Aren't you proud of me? What a pain in the neck. It takes a year. Just do the other thing. And so I totally get that feeling. And this is where we lead to the second part about being conflicted. And it's it's a small Nike riff, which is that just do it. We're not going to go into the origin of that phrase coming from a mass murderer.
00:23:13
But just do it.
00:23:15
Empower those just like a Manson family reference. Gary Gilmore. Wow. I have no idea. All right. That'll be for people to research on their own.
00:23:24
The last thing he said before they killed them.
00:23:27
Wow. Just do it now. You'll never be able to unsee that image. Sorry. Just do it implies what the hell doesn't matter. That's not a good way forward because it pushes you to be a hack who's not responsible for your own work. The alternative is to replace the word just with the word, merely merely do the work that the time you are spending, narrating yourself, doing the work, the time you're spending catastrophizing, the work is not helping anything.
00:23:59
And so I was a really insecure, flailing, failing entrepreneur for at least eight years in a row, just consistently failing, barely breaking, even getting close to bankruptcy on a regular basis. And I was willing things to work out. And I was spending a lot of time. Dramatizing all of the perfect problems that I was confronting and then I was able to shift to merely doing the work without the narrative and without the drama. And as soon as we can merely do the work, then there's room to see what needs to be seen.
00:24:41
So I don't believe in the muse at all. I don't think there's any outside force. I don't think talent really matters. I think what matters is choosing to find your smallest viable audience, understand your genre and explore what it means to make magic in the small so you can do it again. Two things. The first is you are delightful dinner host and I love our dinners.
00:25:05
So not to cherry pick and make it look like a sort of, I might add, back to make.
00:25:15
Yeah, this is not sort of a collage video collage of like NASCAR accidents that I want to paint as the experience at your house. That's not not the case at all. The Matu. I would love to ask about the decision, the point at which you decide you have something that you would like to publish or share and that quality cut off or how you think about it, because in my head, the helpful and self-defeating, depending on how you want to look at it, perfectionist side of things will, for instance, look at something I wrote in 2010 and say I can't do that anymore.
00:25:51
And if I practice, I could still practice for weeks and publish something on the blog and it would not be that good. Therefore, I'm not going to publish because I feel like people will be disappointed or I will be letting them down and that the attention they'll spend on it will not derive or return as much value to them. So that's the voice. That is the the deliberation that I have in my own head. And I do actually have hundreds of drafts, like I have shitty stuff, but it's never quite crossed the chasm into good enough to publish.
00:26:28
So I've been stymieing myself in that respect. And there is part of me that's like, you know what, the podcast is easier. It's fun. I feel like it's a craft I'm still improving on. Why don't I just do that? There is part of me that says that. Then there's another part that says that's a copout. In fact, you know, the writing helps you to learn to think as Kevin Kelly to invoke that name again.
00:26:49
But he writes to think he doesn't think and then write and that I'm shortchanging myself by using perfectionism as an out. Yeah. If I'm hearing all of that, what what comes to mind for you? Well, I'll share my personal experience, but first I want to challenge something you stated as fact, which is that the writing isn't good enough to publish. Says who says me. Right. It's right. That's me. Right.
00:27:19
It's not that the writing isn't good enough to publish, it's that when you look at the writing, your analysis of where you are in the marketplace and the promise you'd like to make and keep doesn't match the writing that's in front of you. But I dare say, as talented as you are, so many things, this might not be your best skill knowing when it's ready to publish.
00:27:43
Yeah, true.
00:27:44
And it may make sense in this world where it is ever easier to hire somebody to do the thing they are good at, to say to this person, here's five thousand words aimed at this kind of reader. Tell me where I got light and tell me where I should take stuff out. Because the way you get my friend, who I went to business school, even climb Mount Everest back when that was a very big deal and I had never seen it.
00:28:13
I mean, there was no YouTube or anything and I was quizzing him. What's that like? Well, he said that the first weeks are just spent walking up this trail. It's not that hard a trail to walk up with tea houses along the way and stuff like that. It's only toward the end, once you've committed to climbing Mount Everest, that Mt. Everest actually gets really hard to climb. And it's unfortunate coincidence for the climbers that it happens in that order because you're sunk.
00:28:42
Costs have increased so much by the time that it gets serious that you're too embarrassed to turn to your peers and say, I can't put in the work. And so what you're doing before you get to the hard part is you're inventing a reason to stop. And you said something that was really poignant, which is you look at stuff you wrote in twenty ten and you say, I can't do that anymore. Well, two things happened to me. First, twenty years ago, I wrote a book called Permission Marketing.
00:29:11
It became a New York Times bestseller. And I said, I'm done. What could I do? First time out of the gate? Because I've been a book packager before. My first, quote, real book. How Can I? So I stopped, I just stopped and I sat in the dark for a year, I just didn't do much of anything because I said I can't hit lightning like that again. And thanks to Malcolm Gladwell, he sent me.
00:29:37
He was unknown. He sent me this new book called The Tipping Point, and he asked me to write a blurb for it. And I read it in one night and realized that without knowing it, I had been writing a book about how ideas spread. And in the next 12 days, I wrote a two hundred and twenty five page book and I sent it to Malcolm and I said, look, if you want me to not publish this because it seems like you unlocked the key and I don't want to take away anything from the tipping point, I will stop and just throw it out.
00:30:12
But I needed to get this out of my system. And he was such a mensch. He gave me his blessing and wrote the foreword. And I realized in that moment I couldn't write permission marketing again. That day was gone, but I could write this book and someone would benefit from it. And then 10 years later, the same twenty, ten years saying, I wrote a book called Linchpin and I will never be able to write a book that good again.
00:30:36
I'll never write a book that goes that deep, close to my bones that makes me feel the way that book made me feel. And after that book came out, I felt the same way again, which is. Well, I if this is the journey, I found the end of the journey. And I realized six, nine months later that that was selfish and that leads to the other key thing I want to talk about, which is generosity and generosity doesn't mean free people pay for surgeon who's going to save their life.
00:31:09
Generosity means that you're bending emotional energy, emotional labor to help somebody else. And as soon as I could shift it around in my head to say, somebody over there who could use a hand, then it wasn't about me anymore. And I wasn't parading anything. And it got way easier to merely do the work without commentary because there's somebody over there I'm doing it for. Here we go. Just a quick thanks to one of our sponsors, and we'll be right back to the show.
00:31:41
This episode is brought to you by athletic greens. I get asked all the time what I would take if I could only take one supplement. The answer is invariably athletic greens. I view it as all in one nutritional insurance.
00:31:54
I recommended it, in fact, in the four hour body, this is more than 10 years ago and I did not get paid to do so. With approximately 75 vitamins, minerals and Whole Foods sourced ingredients, you'd be very hard pressed to find a more nutrient dense and comprehensive formula on the market. It has multivitamins, multi mineral greens, complex probiotics and probiotics for gut health, an immunity formula, digestive enzymes adapt genes and much more. I usually take it once or twice a day just to make sure I've covered my bases.

00:33:17
Tim, you have a great quote in the introduction of the new book from sculptor Elizabeth King. And I'd love to hear you explain this or give examples of how it can apply or might apply. The quote from Elizabeth King is a process saves us from the poverty of our intentions. What does that mean?
00:33:41
There would be no book if it weren't for that quote from Elizabeth King. I don't know how it ended up on my desk. It came from somebody else who took credit for the quote. I started tracking it down because it so resonated with me. And after talking to him, he acknowledged, well, someone else really said it first. And I found this woman. And if you close your eyes and visualize a sculptor, you might be visualizing her.
00:34:05
And if you think about how she lived her life and the number of hours she puts into each piece of work, it's extraordinary. And they made a documentary of some of her work, which you can see on Amazon. I had never heard of her, but now she's my friend and I've just learned so much from that one sentence. What she is saying is this. Tomorrow morning when you wake up. You probably won't feel like engaging in the practice, and if you do, you probably won't feel that way the next day, that what we do is once decide, we decide that we're a runner and runners go running every day.
00:34:47
We decide we're a blogger and bloggers blog every day. And that decision lightens the cognitive load so much because there's no time, no reason to negotiate with ourselves, because we already had the meeting. We already decided. Now, the question is not should we go or not? The question is, should we go left or right? But we're going. Are there other macro decisions like that in your life that you could give us examples of saving yourself from the poverty of intentions or from the whimsy of how you feel on different mornings?
00:35:23
Well, the other one, which is as big as that one is, I think authenticity is a crock and I think authenticity is overrated and talked about far too much. The problem with authenticity is it selfish. Authenticity enables us to say whatever we want. And if people don't like it, well, I was just being authentic. It is a ticket to self-absorbed inconsistency and I don't think anybody we serve wants that. I think what they want is consistency.
00:35:55
I think they want us to make a promise and keep it. And the reason it's called work, not my hobby, is because I made a promise. And so I decided a really long time ago that I was going to be consistent. And it didn't matter if in a moment I felt like yelling at a customer service person or going up on stage when I'm supposed to be adding energy and just taking energy instead. And what I learned from that is.
00:36:24
The way we act determines how we feel. Way more often than the way we feel, determines how we act. I've heard you well, I say I've heard you, I guess, because I know your voice. I hear your voice when I read you that do what you love is for amateurs. Love what you do is the mantra for professionals. And I find this interesting on multiple levels because amateur and the sort of Latin root relates to love.
00:36:55
So if you do what you love is for amateurs that love what you do is for professionals. We can dig into the layers of that. But I'll add one more thing, which is three words, attitudes or skills. And these these these might go together nicely, like a BLT of concepts. Could you expand on any of those?
00:37:17
OK, so let's talk about skills. You've come up first with wrestling and then with other skill based activities that you excelled at by putting an enormous amount of effort and practice and grit. But plenty of other people did, too, and you somehow outperformed them. And you've done that beyond the physical realm. You've done it in culture and in writing as well. I would argue that because in addition to the obvious, easy to measure hard skills of how many words per minute can you type in, how many pounds you bench press.
00:37:54
There are soft skills and they involve curiosity. They involve experimentation and 30 other things. These are all skills in the sense that we can learn them. We can learn to be more honest. We can learn to be more diligent. We can learn to be more persistent. And that's great, because if you can learn them, then you're not stuck where you are. You can become who you want to be. And so if we start by acknowledging that our attitudes, our skills and that skills are learnable, certainly talent recedes far into the rearview mirror and we are going to be rewarded not simply because we can beat someone on a test, but because our whole posture is based on the possibility of better and the possibility of if your goal is to win, to win.
00:38:48
That's the second piece that goes right next to the other skills. And people overlook it because our industrial system doesn't really reward us for measuring that stuff.
00:38:59
How do you take something that is considered an attitude and convert it into a skill? In other words, it seems like you would have to take, say, honesty. And I'm not sure if Ben Franklin did this particularly well necessarily, but as one of the virtues, convert it into some type of habit or action that you practice on a regular basis, is that the right way to think about this? And if so, how might you approach taking something that is widely considered an attitude or a talent and translate it into a skill?
00:39:33
So let's pick being a good listener and being charismatic. I think for most people, if they didn't think about it, a lot would say that those things are talents. Those things come naturally to some people. They're not skills. They're sort of hardwired attitudes that fair? I think so. But we know what makes someone be seen as a good listener and what makes someone be seen as charismatic. And you can do those things. And at the beginning, just like falling asleep, you will be faking it.
00:40:06
But then just like falling asleep, you will be doing it. And in the case of being a good listener, it might sound stilted at first to ask follow up questions. It might sound unnatural at first to leave a beat when you ordinarily would jump in. I think most people don't think of me as a good listener because I jump in and other people who I know, don't they leave that extra beat? Well, that's a skill. And whether it's Dale Carnegie or anyone who's followed in his footsteps, you can learn those things.
00:40:40
And at first you seem as awkward as someone who just learned how to ride a bike and then you don't. Got it. So I should also say that just to reinforce what you're saying, becoming a better listener and that extra beat training yourself to utilize that extra beat is absolutely a practice. Remember Carl Forsman, who wrote for Esquire for ages and ages and ages and has interviewed everybody, Muhammad Ali, I think Corbitt shuff, you name it, and his expression is let the silence do the work and you can remember that and then apply it.
00:41:18
It is a learnable practice of all skill. Are there any particular or any other? Skills that you think are important for, say, entrepreneurs or creatives that have a disproportionate ROIC.
00:41:38
If a listener can train themselves to view them and approach them as skills, I think the combination of patience and impatience, most of the struggling entrepreneurs I've seen are impatient when it comes to things that look like an external hustle. They're emailing people too many times. They're looking for a shortcut. They've got an elevator pitch, they've got the fancy business card, they're pushing and pushing externally. That's the wrong place to be impatient. But when it comes to confronting the thing they're afraid of, they can just make a really wide berth around it.
00:42:12
Instead of figuring out how to be honest, looking in the mirror and saying, you know, this isn't that good, I should just do something else. The same thing is true with someone like Elizabeth King or a stand up comic or Richard. Sara, if we look at yesterday, I was listening to one of the earliest demos of Joni Mitchell. And I don't think there's anybody who wants to argue that Joni Mitchell was a hack, nor anybody who wants to argue that she didn't have a huge contribution to music.
00:42:41
But her cover of the House of the Rising Sun, it wasn't just that I wasn't familiar with her version of it, it just wasn't any good. And fortunately, she was patient with herself, she didn't say, oh, I'm bad at this, and then go work at a 7-Eleven. And so where we need patience is in confronting the things we're going to get better at and strapping in for a useful journey, and where we need impatience is with our fear and with our selfishness about worrying.
00:43:17
What's your perspective on worrying? So I had a riff a while ago.
00:43:21
It was one of my most popular blog posts, and I'm hesitant to dive too deep because I'm not a medical professional. And there are people who are challenged by organic and and trauma related illnesses. But for leaving that group aside, anxiety is experiencing failure in advance. At least it is for me, meaning that after it's over, we don't call it anxiety anymore. We're in grief or we're rebuilding. But when it might go wrong. Worrying anxiety is what we feel when we're imagining it did.
00:44:01
And that's not helping anything. And so the question is, how do we focus that part of our attention on something generous instead? Because anxiety and worry is almost never in service of someone else. It's in service of our need for the status quo and reassurance. And I think that reassurance is futile because you never have enough of it.
00:44:26
Can you say more about that, please? So if it is futile, as we can never have enough of it. Right.
00:44:32
So it feels great to get reassurance. I wish that the phone would ring in the head of the Pulitzer committee saying that they read this thing I wrote and it's fantastic. I would be high as a kite for at least a day and a half and then you'd need it again, because what it did for you was make you feel for a moment like bad outcomes weren't going to happen until you got new evidence that they might. And then you're back to anxiety and worrying again so people will get hooked on reassurance, might end up building an intimacy with the person who's reassuring them all the time.
00:45:14
But it is not helping them do better work, nor is it making them happier. The alternative is to say this might not work. This thing I did, this thing I cared about might not work. Odds are it won't. But I have a portfolio and then I'll make the next thing because we don't live on the savannah. This is not a matter of life or death. Most of the time. It is instead a matter of ego and self-esteem and it's not fatal.
00:45:41
And so all of the worrying is worse than the rejection when it finally comes so better, I think, to merely do the work, be generous with the work and improve our skills so we can do it again. And that gets back to Elizabeth King's quote. You are a. Fantastic presenter, public speaker. Teacher, of course, these things tie together, although not all good public presenters are good teachers, but you are excellent at all those things.
00:46:12
And I remember advice I was given, which I don't follow as well as many, which is presentations fell more often from too much information rather than too little. I think this is true books also. And part of the reason why, as one instance, the four hour chef was such a incredibly challenging and also confusing book, ultimately something I'm very proud of. But it tried to do more than any three books should try to do, and it ended up being very problematic for that reason from the writing perspective, not so much from the reader perspective.
00:46:45
In any case, how do you think about constraints and can you give any examples? Of constraints, historical constraints that you like in your life or applied to other creatives, entrepreneurs, anything. OK, so it's a two part question, the first part is about pedagogy and the thinking about how people learn. And I think one reason that a lot of people are bad at teaching is because they don't think about pedagogy. All they know is they know something.
00:47:18
And if they could just recite all the things they know, someone else will know it, too. And that's not how learning works. So the challenge that we have. Is not seeking information density, and Tufty, I think, made a mistake with this, with his graphs that trying to cram as much information in a square inch as we can about Napoleon's whatever, whatever. Yes. Someone who's into that, who's willing to dissect it will find a marvel of information inside.
00:47:52
I look at a book like The Four Hour Chef and it's stunning the scope of what you did, the depth of what you did. But it has a tufty density problem in that very dense in that you were counting on somebody to go deep into it, get inside your head and learn what you learned. But that's not how the typical person we seek to serve learns something, that we learn things by becoming momentarily incompetent. We used to feel like we were in control, that we understood things, and then all of a sudden a new fact arises that counters what we know.
00:48:30
And in that moment, we're feeling incompetent. And that's when most people quit. But then we get through it and now we know something more than we used to know, and now on to the next thing and pacing, that process is tricky. So if you're sitting listening to a high level conversation between two extraordinary systems engineers, they're back and forth and really fast because they've got full throttle between them. But most of the time, you don't get that privilege.
00:49:01
And so the challenge is not to dumb it down, but to figure out what are the useful chunks of tension that you can create, where someone can feel the tension, get through the tension, absorb it, and then be ready for another bit. And media challenges us because every once in a while something breaks through that super dense and like, I wish I could write something that I wrote one book that was that dense survival is not enough. It's all fourteen thousand copies.
00:49:33
It's hard to get to where people will sit with you for that long. So I'm ranting here, but you asked about boundaries. I appreciate the pedagogies is that discussion is endlessly fascinating to me. The density question of too much, not enough, too little. And then the Goldilocks for the person or avatar you're trying to serve. Right? That is is something that that we could talk about for a very long time and also ask and I think this applies in some respects.
00:50:08
And if you're trying to learn a skill, I think it's also very helpful to apply some constraints, at least to define what you're trying to learn with very tight constraints. So constraints or boundaries?
00:50:20
I think there is a a fetishizing of freedom in in a very unhelpful actually kind of debilitatingly nebulous way among many entrepreneurs, among some creatives who view ultimate freedom, infinite choice. I could do anything at any time as the ideal, although I suspect very few people have experienced what that level of paradox of choice actually inflicts on the human mind.
00:50:58
But could you could you speak to, however you want, constraints, boundaries and how you or other people have applied them? Actually, and hold that just as a bookmark. You've talked about creating tension a few different times in your work or in your presentations and anything that you do. Could you give an example of. How you create or have created tension and then had that release of tension, since you've mentioned that a few different times. I'd love to hear a real world example.
00:51:28
Then we can zig back to constraints and and boundaries. Oh, well, let's start with a trivial example. Ready? I'm ready. Knock, knock. Who's there exactly?
00:51:42
So this we didn't agree in advance to have a back and forth that would lead to a stupid joke, but as soon as you say who's there, a tiny sliver of tension is created, which is why is he doing this and what's going to make it worth it. Right. Or calling a book Purple Cow instead of how to grow your business by becoming remarkable because purple cow creates tension. Why is this in the business section? What does this have to do with anything?
00:52:15
It's a mystery and then the mystery is resolved. That tension is in all form of teaching and culture, if there is no tension, just like if you want to shoot a rubber band across the room, you have to stretch it backwards first. And so what? I try to do when I'm building a workshop or something like the NBA is to say, how few minutes can I speak to lay the groundwork enough that tension will be created so that people will resolve their own tension by learning what it is I need them to learn.
00:52:55
And what the mistake we ought to make, if you know a lot and are trying to teach someone who doesn't know a lot, is we tell them too many things and we relieve the tension. We steal the revelation. Don't steal the revelation. Open the door and let them find the revelation. Could you describe an example for the NBA? I mean, the first thing that came to mind for me is you're describing this in terms of not stealing.
00:53:21
The revelation is actually the Harvard case study method that a place like her business school, they do this other places like Stanford Business School, where you have effectively these two part modules, part one presents a real world historical case study of a problem or opportunity or situation that a business or more accurately, leaders within a business are facing. And then cliffhanger and the class then at that point has to determine the proper course of action, what they think should be done or not done.
00:53:55
And then you have the revelation in part two where they talk about what was actually done and how it turned out. So that jump to mind as an example of that. But I would imagine that is not the format you're using within something like the MBA. So how do you not steal the revelation but create tension so that people will plow ahead with developing a skill or learning something? It's such a cool idea to bring up the Harvard case study, the.
00:54:23
There is a reveal sometimes in a Harvard case, but it is not the revelation. And that's why it works, that if you knew the reveal, the class wouldn't go better. The revelation in a Harvard case is when a student comes up with a an approach that they wouldn't have had if they hadn't heard the conversation. And that probably isn't what the company did, because it's that furrowing around in a safe space that lets you experience years and years and years of strategic business thinking in one year, because like one of the most famous cases, there was a gas chain called Atlantic Richfield Arco, and there were pages and pages of spreadsheets about their credit cards.
00:55:14
And because in the gas business, when gas was 30 cents a gallon, credit cards were a big chunk of what they did and what it forced students to do, who had never thought about any of these issues was digging deep on where does the money flow, what's the resume, what you charge someone and what you make, what is it like to be the low cost provider, et cetera? Well, the reveal is that Arco just canceled all the credit cards and they became the first chain that was just cash only in the 70s and 80s.
00:55:45
But it didn't matter that that's what they did. What mattered was 30 or 60 people together were digging in to this situation. And so I didn't have any of that in mind when I built the MBA. And just an aside, so we're up to five thousand grads, but I shouldn't say we anymore because it's now B Corp and it's run by Maria and Alex. So I've turned the reins over to them. I'm still involved in the Akimbo the B Corp, but I need to give them full credit for the institution that they're building.
00:56:22
What I said was without the 18 pages of Harvard case study, what's a nugget here? So a nugget is something like let's talk about a decision. And tell everyone else in your cohort a decision you made and how you used. Decision thinking to make it and then defend your decision for the five other people you're with and they will do the same with you, and most of us have never actually had an emotion free conversation about a decision that we've made, because usually we make them either after it didn't work out or we forget.
00:57:04
Right. But in this case, having to work your way through it. Well, I decided this instead of that, and I did this instead of that. Suddenly, without me telling you, without anybody telling you, you realize there's actually a calculus to making almost any decision and you glossed over the parts that you were afraid of and now you can see them differently. And when you add to that the persistence of the cohort, what you end up with is this increase in safety and enrollment, which are the two core elements of learning that enable you to deal with ever more tension.
00:57:42
Which leads to more incompetence, which leads to the revelation. Well, so many so many different directions we can talk from there, but we skipped over a lot about oh no we did, we didn't skip, I threw a boomerang. And we're coming back to constraints so we could talk about Susan Rothenburg painted horses. We could talk about Ken Burns, we could talk about Mr. Rogers.
00:58:03
If you look at many of these iconic, whether it be television shows, movies, creatives, teachers who you have described in your books and elsewhere, they are stellar examples of the power of positive constraints. And I would just love to hear you tell a story or two that really stand out for you, whether it's other people or the constraints that have been incredibly impactful for you personally. Constraints used to frustrate me so much, and now they're the core of my useful working life, I'll start with this.
00:58:44
When I was growing up, I broke my arm and I broke my nose playing hockey and I was terrible at it. But I knew what was going on on the ice, but I was terrible at it. The thing is, if you've ever tried to play hockey rink that has no boards, that's just a giant like the totally different game. The boards are the point. Without the boards, there is no hockey. And for me, I've set up constraints all around me, constraints about how I choose which projects, constraints about what I eat, constraints about what a project can entail and what it can't entail, constraints about how many people work with me, constraints about which media I'm going to be in and which ones I'm not going to be in.
00:59:27
And they're all arbitrary that there isn't a law of nature that says, don't be on tick tock, don't be on Twitter, but it's OK to have a daily blog. I don't know where those rules came from. I just made up rules because having constraints lets me get to the edge. It lets me get to the boards without breaking my nose. That knowing. So in the case of the NBA, I built it in a two week period of time in the desert in Utah and I made like seven constraints because I could have built it in a hundred different directions.
01:00:00
But I made constraints about what the dropout rate would be, what the tools we would use would be, what tools we wouldn't use, what it would cost. All of those things went in before I started brainstorming anything, because I know that the cost of going back and starting over is tiny, whereas the cost of making up the constraints after you have what you think of as a great idea are enormous.
01:00:27
When people start a business, or I should say rather, it was about to become an illustration of what you probably don't want to do when someone comes to you and says, I am thinking of starting a business, how would you usher them through the process of deciding on constraints before they embark on creating some darling that they're not willing to kill or, yes, get tied up in knots.
01:00:57
So the core questions that we begin with are what resources are you willing to put into this? Either resources you're willing to expend emotional labor and risk to get or resources you already have. There could be resources of time and risk tolerance and money. Right. Number two is who do you want your customers to be? Because if you hate your customers, you're going to hate your business. And number three is what do you want to get out of this?
01:01:25
Are you looking for something that makes every day better or are you looking to grool your way through something so that X number of months or years from now you win a prize? Notice that you don't get to reverse the answers to these from what you started with as your germ of an idea that these are not about your idea at all. And you can always tell when an entrepreneur is trying to backpedal as fast as they can and say, well, the idea I really want to do is so-and-so.
01:01:54
So therefore these are my answers. I've done that. And every time I've done that, I have been disappointed if we can look at it with that agnostic point of view. Now, we've created a puzzle and puzzles always have constraints and boundaries and we are given that this is the puzzle. No, you cannot come up with a carbon sequestration technology that will spread around the world and help you dominate a new industry when you're only willing to mortgage your house.
01:02:24
No, that can't be done. So you've found another set of place where your goals and your constraints conflict. So instead, let's take a deep breath and figure out what you really are hoping to do every day and what success will look like when you're done. And one specific example that I think your listeners really resonate with is freelancer's. If you're really a freelancer, you have no employees. You only sell your X number of hours a week. That's all you get.
01:02:57
But if at the same time you want to make ten million dollars a year, you're going to be unhappy because you can't really be a sole practitioner freelancer who's making ten million dollars a year. So which is it? And let's get really clear about why you're doing this. Do it for and what's it for.
01:03:15
What do you do with someone who has started a business or a creative endeavor or they're a freelancer who now they have X number of employees and the original plot has kind of escaped, if that makes any sense or priorities and they now want to. Take the car into the shop and apply some constraints, is there a particular approach you might recommend to those people who have you know, they're already out of the garage, they've been driving around. They're like, OK, there's a problem.
01:03:49
This needs to be fixed. The answer could be, of course, just. Retiring. That's that's one option, but are there other ways that you encourage people to explore? Right, constraints, if if they already are in motion with something. So you've touched on one of the most important elements of human nature, which is our inability to ignore sunk costs costs are that the unspoken minefield of mistake in which we rationalize why we have to justify the thing we already have.
01:04:29
We invent new meanings for the word momentum well beyond Isaac Newton. And we imagine that we have to stick with what we did so much of the time. Learning to ignore sunk costs is the single most useful thing I can point out to people. However, there are times when you actually do have momentum, when you have trust, when you have assets, when you have a chance to go forward. And in the book I tell the story of RTM and RTM was a successful college radio band that was gigging hundreds of times a year.
01:05:02
But they were not the rhythm of today. They weren't this famous legendary band. And they made two decisions, they invented two constraints before they made a new album and the constraints were we're going to stop touring for four months and you'd be amazed at how few bands add a constraint. If you saw the Gogol's documentary, The Go Goes would have definitely had a half a dozen more hit albums if they had just stopped touring for three months when they were all burning out.
01:05:32
And then the second thing they did was they switched instruments that the guitars switched to the mandolin and the bass player switched to the guitar and they said, you have to play a different instrument on this album. Those two decisions ended up creating one of the best selling albums of the decade because they got all the benefits of their momentum and their trust for each other and the trust with the fans, but those fresh eyes and those new boundaries enabled them to explore new edges.
01:06:02
And it's at the edges where the tension lies. And so they weren't playing covers of their old selves. They were something new.
01:06:10
So I want to talk about the practice. And there's there's a there's a little nugget in the elements of the practice, this list of elements contained in the many chapters and bits of wisdom and tactical advice that you have in this book. One is seek joy. How does one do that? Well, it gets back to enjoying what you do more than doing what you enjoy. And so the question is, you know, Marshall Islands, who just wrote a book with David Graber, who recently passed away, but Marshall Islands wrote a breakthrough book in the 60s called Stoneage Economics, and it is about what it was like to be a caveman.
01:07:00
And it turns out the cavemen who in my view were wearing like these horrible Flintstone's like clothes and barely surviving, only worked three hours a day. And they spent the rest of their time being present and alive and with their family and all the things that people say they want to do more of. And what's fascinating to me about that is lots of the people that you and I know who go to work and just dig it out day after day, don't do it because they need more money.
01:07:34
They are seeking some sort of status, some sort of emotional engagement, some sort of energy, but they forget along the way because they signed up for this other game that there is the game one can play of. Wow, that really was cool. What I just made. That fills me with joy. I just did something generous. I just connected with someone at an elemental level that they're are too busy playing somebody else's game to play that game.
01:08:04
I've read in many books that some version of we're all playing games and step step one is to know which game we're playing. And maybe step two is to deliberately choose the game we're playing as opposed to something we absorbed or inherited or had imposed on us by by others or by upbringing. You have zigged quite a lot when others have zagged. How do you think about the game or games that you play? Because these are just like hockey, right?
01:08:38
There are certain constraints and certain objectives, certain values that are given points positively or negatively.
01:08:45
How have you chosen the games you have chosen and how has that changed over time? I know that's like 15 questions in one, but I know you can handle it.
01:08:54
It's a great question and there are a few people I would answer it for, but I'm delighted to answer it for you. It's a great question. The first of all is you don't break your nose.
01:09:02
Really, that is the first rule. And what I mean by that is I have been surrounded since I started one of the first Internet companies, which was nineteen ninety ninety one before the World Wide Web. I have been surrounded by people who have been playing a game with very few elements of scorekeeping that generally revolve around wealth. And they will come up with all sorts of reasons why their Silicon Valley doohickey is going to change the world for the better.
01:09:35
But it's not really true, and they will make decisions and compromises about who they hire and how they spend their day because that game is culturally sanctioned. It is a game that's truly deniable in the Milton Friedman sense. And, you know, you're getting what technology wants. You're getting what the market wants, turn the ratchet. And it has been thrilling every few years to be around that rush of growth. But early on with your dean, I saw what it would mean to take it to the next level.
01:10:13
And when I got the seventy employees, I said, I can't these people should not be counting on me and I can't play the way I like to play on behalf of 70 other people. And so I had to stop and then a few years later, I did it again with Squidgy, which was before Pinterest and all the rest. And so what I have learned is that veering away from the next two zeroes of upside is really expensive and the single best way for me to live the life I want to live.
01:10:47
And so I didn't write the sequel to Permission Marketing and I didn't start MailChimp and I didn't you know, there's all these things I could have done if I was a business builder. But I'm not a business builder. The game I'm playing is have I earn enough trust to do another Jenners project that I'm proud of? And if so, do I get to do it again? What other elements of the life you wanted to live provided for you, the tipping of the scales, like you said, I mean, giving up those additional two zeros of upside has a cost.
01:11:22
I mean, there is sort of an incremental return on dollar, right? At some point, like a marginal use of each dollar. But there's a sacrifice being made. What how would you describe the life you wanted to live that was on the other side of door number two? So you mean the one I picked as opposed to the one I walked away from? That's right. I was so fortunate to have two amazing parents, and we lived in Buffalo, New York, not a big town.
01:11:52
And there were always people parading in our house one night at one Thanksgiving, 18 Russian refuseniks showed up for their first Thanksgiving, all smoking like chimneys like that.
01:12:05
The. Way, it felt, to see them be part of the community of their choice and to simply commit to the work they were doing, so my mom worked as a volunteer at the museum and then got a job there and pioneered the museum store. And she just stuck with it and stuck with it and stuck with it without a lot of drama. But in terms of it was sustaining and she could point to the work that she did that others didn't think we're going to make a difference.
01:12:40
That really did. And that was my role model. And I was aware really early on that that was sort of unique, that I was really lucky to have that privilege and that head start. But I have been aware that it would be really easy to blow. It would be really easy to say I need a seven thousand eight house as opposed to just one. And so one of the constraints was. There is enough and knowing that there is enough opens the door to merely do the work, whereas if you need to get attached to the outcome because you need more now, you're not doing the work anymore.
01:13:20
Now you're just simply trading for the outcome.
01:13:22
What's. What's so bad about trading for the outcome? Is it because and I playing a bit of a devil's advocate here, but is it that you ultimately cannot determine the outcome because so much is outside of your control? Is that what makes that unappealing? Is it just that day to day your kind of trading misery now for some low probability, ill defined happiness in the future, that it's probably not going to come true? What are the main risks of kind of betting on outcome?
01:13:55
Because that is what a lot of people do, right? I mean, I'm yes, I'm in Austin, but it's it's right now as opposed to Silicon Valley. But the outcome driven decision making is the default, I would say, in the sort of individualized American culture at least. What are the main risks that you see that that I have mentioned a couple of ways to look at this.
01:14:18
You're exactly right that the current Western mindset is tell me if it's going to work and then I'll do it. And hardest part of this comes from school, which is, you know, you're in school. If someone says, will this be on the test? The phrase will this beyond the test means I am willing to momentarily memorize this if you're willing to trade me for an A. And if not, I'll zone out because I got plenty of other things to do.
01:14:44
I'll be back when you're ready to trade. But then let's go one more step. There's a hackneyed there's that word, there's a hackneyed expression, which is what would you do if you knew you could not fail? And I find that completely unhelpful because it's basically a genie question. I want invisibility and I want control over this. And you're never going to get this. Here's my question. What would you do if you knew you would fail? What would be worth doing even though it's not going to work?
01:15:16
And if you've got things on that list that you haven't been doing. Ironically, those are the things that are most likely to work because other people aren't doing them either. And this idea of attachment, I mean, she said the bad news is we are falling, falling, falling. The good news is there's nothing to hold on to. And as soon as we get closer, there's nothing to hold on to that we can get back to the work.
01:15:47
Elizabeth King's practice that prevents us from wondering about what prize we're going to get. This is just the work. Then you can merely do it. Most people who enter the Boston Marathon know they're not going to win, but they enter anyway. And that's the way I think life is probably more like then I will only enter the marathon if I'm going to win it. The practice is your. What book, which number? By the way, I counted maybe 20, 20, why write this book?
01:16:29
So as you and I both know, writing a book is a ridiculous venture, it takes a really long time and then when you're done with it, almost nobody says fantastic the way they do say if you made a new record, because when you make a record, you listen to it, but you make a book, they ask for a prize because they finished reading it and.
01:16:54
So I only write a book when I have no choice. And what makes me have no choice? Well, what I learned a really long time ago is once I start working my way through a set of ideas, I owe those ideas something. And they owe I owe them a package and a way for them to come to people and a venue that I hope will help. And the thing about a book that isn't true for all other forms of electric media, electronic media that are easy to share is when you hand someone a book.
01:17:29
The whole package is right there. And when your book goes to a book, you get to do it together. And so, yeah, I made a workshop about what's in this book and I could have written 20 blog posts instead of writing a book. But I wanted to signal to myself and to other people that this one was book worthy. And probably for the last five books I felt like maybe I don't know when the next book's coming after it.
01:17:54
And this one's one of those, which is if this has to be my last book, I'm proud to make this one my last book.
01:18:00
What should people hope to get from this book? What is the promise or premise of the practice?
01:18:06
Well, the subtitle is Ship Creative Work. And either you do that for a living or you don't if you don't do that for a living. Good luck to you because you're a cog in a system that wants to replace you. On the other hand, if you ship creative work, ship means it doesn't ship. It doesn't count. Work means you do it even when you don't feel like it. And creative is where the joy is, because creative is no one's ever done it this way before.
01:18:30
And here I made this and all I know for me anyway is those moments they're they're bathed in golden light for me when I feel like I just got a shipment in 10 minutes before we started talking of the dozen collectors packages that I designed and printed to go with this for four hundred people. And I'm just holding them in my hands. And it was only three months ago, but I don't remember making them. I just remember the way it felt to make them.
01:19:02
And I want other people to feel that feeling while they're serving the people around them.
01:19:06
This is going to seem like a complete left turn, but I'm going to try to I'm going to try to make it more of a mogel course.
01:19:13
That makes some sense.
01:19:18
Would you suggest people learn to juggle? So I have taught more people to juggle than most I'm not a great juggler, but we're not talking about figuratively, I'm talking about actually juggling. So let's talk this through, because I think it's a useful lesson if you have ever seen a juggler. On television or on video or in person, what you notice is that they don't drop the ball, not dropping the ball is perhaps the driving force of what makes someone a juggler.
01:19:51
And if you are enjoying the show, you're willing and wishing the balls not to drop. So if someone says you want to learn how to juggle, you might say yes. And this is what always happens when I teach people to juggle, they grab three balls and say, no, no, they grab three balls and they throw the first one. This is easy. So the second one. And then they go to catch it because they know catching is the key to juggling.
01:20:15
And by the time they get to the second ball, they have to lunge for it. And once you lunge for the second ball, you're out of position for the third one and then you're done. It's all in the ground and you give up on juggling because if juggling is about catching, you're terrible at it. What's the alternative? Well, the way I've taught people how to juggle is simple. I give them one ball and we spend between 20 minutes and 30 minutes throwing the ball and letting it hit the ground.
01:20:44
No, kachi. Then we had the second ball. Throw, throw, drop, drop. No kachi throw, throw, drop, drop. If you do that for 40 minutes total, you're going to be really good at throwing. And if you get really good at throwing, the catching takes care of itself. And this is the part about divorce from the outcome, because all we care about, if we want to learn to juggle, is to learn to throw.
01:21:11
And the metaphor I cannot escape, which is getting better at throwing, is what we have to do to build resilience and it's what we have to do to live in a world that's changing ever faster, because if we try to anchor on outcomes and control results, we're in the catching business and then we're really in bad trouble. So to continue with this, the throwing instead of catching this inversion of importance, that. Then allows someone to actually learn the skill they set out to learn, but doing it in a very counterintuitive way, the first thing I'll say is that this reminds me a lot of how I learned to swim in my 30s.
01:21:55
I couldn't swim until I got thirties.
01:21:58
And it was Terry Lochlan of total immersion swimming, may he rest in peace, passed away a few years ago, who indirectly, I suppose, through his writing, I learned I learned to swim through a book, which is just astonishing when you think about it, because he took out the base assumptions or he corrected the base assumptions of swimming. Namely, I thought I need to swim on top of the water and I need to kick, which is in fact how a lot of swimming is taught.
01:22:27
And he said, no, you're not going to do that and you're not even going to focus on kicking like we are not going to do anything that will make you tired. In fact, if you are tired when you were learning how to swim, you're doing it incorrectly. We're just going to have to kick off the side of the shallow end of a pool and practice getting into a fuselage position and the sequence. Even though in retrospect, it makes perfect sense, was so different from any other attempt.
01:22:51
Yeah, I that that I had made through books, videos, instruction, coaching, you name it, it just worked and it blew my mind. And now I swim. I mean, I'm assuming you're with me today to go swimming for relaxation, which I never thought in a million years would be the case.
01:23:06
I never I never said yes of because I could have to interject here. I never knew this about you. I swim his method every single day and I knew how to swim. But the year I was at Stanford, they had a Masters class at the Stanford pool and I couldn't resist. I went. And this guy comes out to teach it, he's the consultant to the US Olympic swim team and he's assisted by the coach of the Stanford swim team.
01:23:34
His name's Bill Boomer. Bill had a very significant potbelly and one arm. And I like this guy is going to teach us how to swim and the beauty of it was it's all about the process and not about the outcome because you don't get good at the outcome for a long time. And the second part, when we were talking about incompetence before, but you didn't mention is learning to swim. Kerry's way involves drowning for at least an hour and a half.
01:24:06
And that's why most people don't get to the other side.
01:24:11
Just to be clear, it is an uncomfortable practice by design.
01:24:16
There is, if done correctly, no risk is a physical risk involved if you're doing it with supervision. And he will do also things like remove breathing. Right, in the sense that you are not swimming and learning how to breathe. At the same time, it's just too much. That's like being given a unicycle and seven balls to juggle. It's like that's just not going to work for the vast majority of folks. And so he says, all right, great.
01:24:41
Well, let's take the breathing out of it. At that failure point will be removed. Let's take out the breathing. We're just going to focus on hydrodynamics and teaching you that naturally, because of the density of your body, you're going to be 70 plus percent underwater when you sweat a period full stop. You're not a hydrofoil. And you gave then what I think is in some respects a comparable example of a logical but counterintuitive progression with the learning to throw instead of catch up if someone were to ask you.
01:25:17
How would you teach someone to be creative and I'm asking that in a deliberately maybe problematic way, but what would your answer be if they were like, great, I get the swimming example, I get the juggling example, I want to be more creative. What's the equivalent for becoming more creative? What would you say?
01:25:35
It's exactly the same, and I've done it many, many times. Here you go. If you want to learn how to juggle, you have to drop an enormous number of balls. If you want to learn how to swim, you have to sort of drown. And if you want to learn to be creative, you have to show me an enormous number of bad ideas. Pick the smallest region, domain any segment you want, start listing your bad ideas, keep listing your bad ideas.
01:26:03
Let's prove that your bad ideas are not fatal. That's part one. Part two domain knowledge and genre. It is true that every once in a while, an outsider shows up with something that nobody on the inside ever thought of, but that's not usually what happens. What usually happens is someone who has good taste, decides to be willing to be creative and good taste means, you know, what your audience wants 10 minutes before they do. That's all.
01:26:37
You can't have good taste unless you have domain knowledge and understanding genre. So if you combine those two things, shipping on the regular and good taste, you can be creative. When you say genre. What do you mean, because this is a if someone is accused of and I use that word very deliberately, being a genre writer or a genre of this genre, that it can be used in a derisive way, what what do you mean by genre and how would you prefer people to understand genre so generic and genre are not being used by me in the same way genre means what am I expecting when I encounter your work so early?
01:27:25
Stanley Gardner wrote mystery novels and they fit neatly into the genre of mystery novels. We knew which section of the bookstore to put them in, but they were nothing like Agatha Christie novels. And General Stanley Gardner sold a quarter of a billion books by writing his own distinct, idiosyncratic, peculiar particular books that clearly were in a genre. Can I just say for a second, I apologize.
01:27:50
You were talking about how 99 percent of the people in the United States haven't read your books.
01:27:54
I am constantly both amazed and not surprised at all that you just mentioned someone who sold a quarter billion books. And I have no idea who this person is. May I have a few bars? Yeah.
01:28:08
Donna, Donna, Donna, Donna. All the Perry Mason books are amazing. And he wrote he had a secretary who is a little like Della Street Della. I don't know what her name was. His secretary had a yellow legal pad. Earl dictated the books while she followed him around, didn't edit a word. Every two weeks he had a new one.
01:28:35
Wow. It's kind of it's like James the. The James Patterson machine. Yeah.
01:28:40
Or James Bond. It goes with the word James, apparently. But the thing about genre is we don't know what to do with a creative idea that doesn't rhyme with anything else. Right. So is Google a creative innovation after the world had seen Yahoo! Well, of course it is, because Marissa and the rest said, let's not have one hundred and eighty three links on the homepage. Let's have two. The search results themselves weren't that different for years, but the leap was, you know, what a search engine is.
01:29:10
This is just like that search engine, except it's different. But if they hadn't seen Yahoo! And Alta Vista, they never could have built Google and we wouldn't have known what to do with it if we hadn't seen a search engine. And so what genre says is there's a box and I can't think outside the box because it's dark, but on the edges of the box, I have leverage. You've got to know what the boxes before you can make a thing that is going to be seen as creative.
01:29:38
Mm hmm. If we look at the contents of the practice, there's a lot there's a lot here.
01:29:49
Two hundred and thirty thirty chapters and the books, less than two hundred and thirty pages long. Yes, right.
01:29:55
So two hundred thirty chapters. And I'm looking at. A partial list, and I wonder which of these you hope people will pay particular attention to because they are mother qualities of a sense. And what I mean by that is I can't recall the attribution, so I won't try to make it up on the spot. But I've heard in different forms courage is the sort of mother virtue of all virtues, because at the breaking point, at the testing point, without courage, none of those virtues can be enacted.
01:30:34
Something along those lines.
01:30:35
I like that. Yeah. Are there any particular chapters or qualities, principles that you really hope people will pay particular attention to that if not act as prerequisites in some fashion, help the others.
01:30:51
So one of the reasons that this needs to be a book or a workshop, the last one hundred and fifty days is we're so complicated. Everyone's come up with their own combination of what's holding them back and the way to unlock it. I wish there was a hierarchy and a taxonomy that said this is how we get all the way up to the top. I don't feel like it's Maslova in that way, I feel like we each find our own sinecure, our own way to hide out from the thing that is keeping us from the creativity that we want to deliver.
01:31:35
And it starts to eat us up inside. And that the deeper we've built it, the harder it is for us to have an outsider help us. The list of excuses we have is infinite. And so I don't know if I could point to this one, which unlocks all of them. I guess the juggling one has a big piece of it which is throwing, not catching. And I think the generosity one, which is I'm not throwing for myself, I am throwing for other people.
01:32:05
When I add those two up, well, I end up with is this creativity is a generous act. Get out of your own way. Don't ask for a guarantee, simply merely ship the work without drama and without dialogue, which is the opposite, it would seem.
01:32:25
Please correct me if I'm wrong of a word you just used that I did not know the definition to say. Therefore I had to look it up sinecure as I any see. You are now in a position requiring little or no work, but giving the holder status or financial benefit from the Latin Cinecitta Kouda without care. So rather than do that, you're effectively, it would seem like going to the opposite end of the spectrum that fair to say, although status or financial benefit could come along with it.
01:32:57
But it is a very different combination of things that you suggesting.
01:33:01
So let's go back to Joni Mitchell, because something happened to Joni Mitchell after I don't know which album. No. And it was that she was unstoppable, that her albums were on every radio station and were in every college dorm room. And Joni was in danger of becoming a hack because the audience knew exactly what they wanted from a Joni Mitchell record and exactly what they wanted from a Joni Mitchell concert. And Joni Mitchell looked at that and she said, I'm whatever.
01:33:33
Thirty years old, I could do this quite profitably for the next 40 years. It's a sinecure that you will be beloved and she will never fail because writing another Joni Mitchell song was pretty easy for her. And so she made a record called Donovans Reckless Daughter, and then she made a couple other ones after that that seemed intentionally designed to alienate her audience.
01:34:00
But they weren't they were intentionally designed to alienate the old Joni Mitchell's audience so that she could find her smallest viable audience and make the music she wanted to for them because her goal wasn't to sell more records. Her goal was to explore that golden place of, wow, this might not work, but if she kept making the things that would work. She would ruin her life, and I just I listen to that record. God must be a boogie man with Dacko Pistorius on the fretless bass and there's still songs in there I don't get yet, but I'm so proud of her to have said enough.
01:34:44
I have enough. Now, how do I make better?
01:34:48
What would you do even if you knew you would fail? I love that. I love that recasting of the question that I've always enjoyed, but for any number of reasons, very often not come up with great answers to what would you do if you knew you could not fill the void, even if you knew you would fail?
01:35:07
In a sense. I mean, it's of course, there are some caveats to the question in a sense. But if you answer this or pursue the answers, explore the answers to that question, you also end up doing things for which you will have a it will be natural to say unnatural, but an uncommon endurance or attachment.
01:35:32
Well, then increase the likelihood that over time you will have some version of success, you know, it seems that way to me at least, and if you don't, then you've chosen in such a way that at least the path along the way has some has some nice scenery so that you're just not, you know, a horse in Times Square with blinders on going around in circles.
01:35:53
Well said, Seth, you're always so fun to chat with. I enjoy our conversations immensely. I've taken a bunch of notes for myself. People can find you at Seth's DOT blog. I can find you on Twitter, Instagram at this is Sess blog on Twitter, Instagram at Seth Godin. A link to everything, including the new book, the practice subtitle Shiping Creative Work. In the show, Anota Teamed Blog Forward Slash Podcast. Is there anything else you would like to say?
01:36:24
Any recommendations, requests, comments, complaints, anything that you would like to put in front of the listeners before we wrap?
01:36:33
I would, because you gave me the last word, which is. It's easy to forget how hard you have worked at leading, illuminating and pushing yourself to become different, better versions, and you show up on the regular and share it. And I, for one, am grateful you do. Mm hmm. Thank you very much, Seth. I really appreciate it. And that needed that today. That's a longer story. But I really I really appreciate you saying that and hope to see you again soon.
01:37:08
But in the meantime, thank you for taking the time today to share your life, your learnings and the importance of the practice. I really appreciate it.
01:37:19
Thanks to you and to everybody else until next time. Thank you for listening. Hey, guys, this is Tim again. Just a few more things before you take off number one. This is five Bullett Friday. Do you want to get a short email from me? And would you enjoy getting a short e-mail from me every Friday if that provides a little morsel of fun before the weekend? And Pfeifle of Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been pondering over the week that could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.
01:37:52
It could include gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've somehow dug up into the world of the esoteric as I do. It could include favorite articles that I have read and that I've shared with my close friends, for instance. And it's very short. It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend. So if you want to receive that, check it out. Just go to four hour work week dot com, that's four hour work week dot com all spelled out.
01:38:21
And just drop in your email and you will get the very next one. And if you sign up, I hope you enjoy it. This episode is brought to you by Tonle Toenail. I'm super excited about this one and I was skeptical of it in the beginning. Total quote, Total is the world's most intelligent home gym and personal trainer, end quote. That's the tagline from their website, folks, to give you that one sentence summary. And this device, it's really a system is perfect for anyone looking to take their own workouts to the next level or someone who just wants to get maximum bang for the buck.
01:38:54
In a tiny, tiny space, total is precision engineered to be the world's most advanced strength studio and personal trainer. It uses breakthrough technology of all different types to help get you stronger, faster. I was introduced to total by three different friends. All of them are tech savvy. One of them is a former competitive skier who's doubled his strength in a number of movements using total, even though he has a long athletic background. And I'll paint a picture for you by eliminating traditional metal weights, dumbbells and barbells total from deliver 200 pounds of resistance, which doesn't sound like a lot, but it's actually it feels like a lot more of the high end in a device smaller than a flat screen TV.
01:39:33
And you can perform at least one hundred and fifty different exercises. And these different technologies are exclusive to total. And you can dial weights up and down with the touch of a button in one pound increments using magnets and electricity. So the movement is extremely smooth. And even though I have a home gym already in my garage, I'm still getting a total installed. I'd use total for multiple workouts now to do things I just cannot do in my home gym, such as the chop and lift exercises from where our body, all sorts of cable exercises that usually involve much, much bigger piece of equipment centric training.
01:40:11
For instance, you can do to give a simple example, bicep curls where you are lifting, let's just say twenty pounds in each hand up. And then that total will automatically increase the weight because you can lower more than you can lift to say twenty five thirty pounds on the weight down. And I do kettlebell swings, I do all sorts of deadlifts, this that the other thing. And after one workout on total focusing on polling I was blasted for a full week.
01:40:38
It's really incredible what you can do with eccentrics. They also have all sorts of other really, really cool advantages that you can apply to any of your favorite movies. Total learns from your strength and provides suggestive weight recommendations for every move with detailed progress reports to help you see your strengths grow.
