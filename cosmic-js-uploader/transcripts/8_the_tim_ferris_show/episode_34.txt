Hello, boys and girls, ladies and germs, this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to the Tim Ferris show, where it is my job every episode to deconstruct world class performers of all different types, to tease out the habits, routines, favorite books, who knows what that you can hopefully emulate or apply in your own lives. My guest today is none other than Scott Kelly at Station KDA, Kelly on Twitter and elsewhere. Scott is a former military fighter pilot and test pilot, an engineer, a retired astronaut and retired U.S. Navy captain.
00:00:31
A veteran of four space flights, Kelly commanded the International Space Station issus on three expeditions and was a member of the year long mission aboard the ISS, the single longest space mission by an American astronaut. In October 2015, he set the American record for the total accumulated number of days spent in space. Go for launch. How to Dream, Lead and Achieve is Kellie's to our audio course available exclusively on Knowable. In this candid and entertaining audio course, Scott shares instructive stories from his childhood in New Jersey, his days as a U.S. Navy test pilot, and his year hurtling around the globe at seventeen thousand five hundred miles per hour and teaches hard earned lessons on perseverance, personal motivation and the human side of success drawn from his experiences in the most competitive, extreme environments imaginable.
00:01:17
You can find it now at Knowable. That's K and a little FYI, I forgot you can find him on social, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, attestations KDA Kelly. And before we jump into the interview, I want to play you one lesson from Scott's audio. Of course, the lesson is titled The Smartest Person on the Mission, and it really highlights decision making underpressure a superpower of his. Also after the interview ends, I'll share two more of Scott's lessons.
00:01:45
So be sure to stick around.
00:01:49
Sometimes in space, you get a call from a third grade classroom that wants to see what it looks like to go to the bathroom in zero gravity. Other times you get a call from mission control saying there's a hole the size of a golf ball in a heat shield and you might burn up on reentry. I got that call a day or so into commanding my first and only space shuttle mission. A similar issue had killed seven of my colleagues on Columbia a few years earlier.
00:02:17
We could do a spacewalk to try to repair the heat shield. But spacewalks are extremely risky on their own. And there was always a danger we could just damage the heat shield more while trying to fix it. But if we left the hole as it was, the heat of reentry might tear the space shuttle apart. As commander, I had a lot of say in what our approach was going to be. It would have been tempting to make a quick decision on my own.
00:02:43
But over the years I've spent leading and following, I've learned that the best decisions are made that way.
00:02:49
Instead, I found a good time to take each crew member aside one by one. In private, I kept a picture of the heat shield damage and a printout of some analysis from the ground in my back pocket so I'd be able to take advantage of a quiet moment. I made sure I spoke to each of my crew members individually to get their honest opinions. I took this to such an extreme that I asked everyone I could even ask the astronaut and Russian cosmonauts who weren't coming back with us on Endeavour, why not call a meeting?
00:03:19
Why not make a decision together as a group? Well, I've seen what can happen when people try to make decisions in groups. One person will offer an opinion. And if that person is knowledgeable or well respected, everyone else might go along with what they said. Groupthink sets in. People aren't even conscious of doing this. Sometimes it's something we do as a social species to get along, and it's often a useful instinct. But in a case like this, it could be deadly.
00:03:50
There's a sign on the wall in a meeting room at NASA. None of us is as dumb as all of us. And it's a lesson NASA had to learn the hard way. It's part of what went wrong with the Columbia accident and with Challenger before it. People who raised concerns were silenced because groupthink had taken over with the input of my crew. And after thorough analysis, we decided, along with flight controllers and leaderships on the ground, that coming back with the hole in the heat shield posed less of a risk than attempting a repair.
00:04:22
Right. I mean, when the the gouge goes pretty much through, the entire thickness of the tile itself is one point two inches thick.
00:04:32
We fire the deorbit engines. And as we came out of darkness and started hitting the atmosphere, the plasma field, the fire outside the space shuttle continued to build. Pretty soon we were in a 3000 degree fireball falling towards Earth at an incredible speed. Me and my entire crew were mostly silent as we approached the point where the space shuttle Columbia had come apart. As we transition through that altitude, my pilot skorts said, passing through Picardy understand, I replied, I let about 20 seconds go by and add it looks like we dodged that bullet as we all reflected on the loss of her seven colleagues.
00:05:19
About 30 minutes later, he landed safely at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. But this kind of decision making can help in other places to places like a level one trauma center in Tucson, Arizona.
00:05:37
When my sister in law, Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, was shot in 2011, I was in space halfway through a six month mission. My brother Mark was constantly having to make difficult decisions about her care. He found himself in meetings with many of her caretakers, trauma surgeons, brain surgeons, neurologists. But instead of just hearing out the top doctor or more experienced expert, Mark would go a step further. He would find one quiet person in the back of the room and ask them who they were.
00:06:08
I'm just an intern, they might say, or I'm just a nurse. But Mark didn't care what the person's training was. What do you think he would ask? What are we missing? What are we overlooking? Even if they hadn't been there long, their opinion mattered. And he learned valuable information by gathering as many perspectives as he could. I learned as much as seeing from how he handled Gabby's care as I did from anyone I flew with in space.
00:06:36
The smartest person in the room I've learned is usually the person who knows how to tap into the intelligence of every person in the room.

At this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. Can I ask you a personal question? Now, at the same time, what it's like to be a cybernetic organism living tissue over metal and go to Paris, so. Scott, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me, Tim. And I wanted to start not with space, but with West Orange, New Jersey, in, I suppose, the 60s.
00:12:02
And your mom specifically, could you please speak to your mom's experience with joining the police force?
00:12:10
Well, that's a that's a good place to start with my mom, because we all started with our moms. And really this this all happened kind of in the late 70s and throughout the 80s where my dad was a cop in New Jersey and he was in my hometown of West Orange. He was one of those stereotypical like Irish cop guys you'd see on TV. And my mother was a secretary and a waitress, various jobs she had at different times. And about the time my brother and I were becoming teenagers, when she could spend more time at work.
00:12:42
She decided that she wanted to have a career like my father's and was going to attempt to become a police officer in our hometown that never had a female police officer before at the time. There are very few in the state of New Jersey. You know, it was a challenging thing for her, especially the physical part of it, because, you know, at that time it was a physical fitness test was really designed for the men that were trying to become policemen and firefighters.
00:13:11
The civil service exams that included physical fitness portion. And it was a challenge that for her was not easy. But, you know, I saw her work really, really hard at this. And, you know, my dad helped her by setting up this obstacle course in our backyard. And, you know, when she first went out there, she was not very successful. And, you know, I was a little bit skeptical. I can remember thinking, is she going to really be able to do this?
00:13:34
But she you know, she had a goal that she wanted to achieve, a plan to get there. And she was successful. And it was the first time in my life that I saw the the power of having this goal. You think you might not be able to achieve a plan to get there and then working really, really hard at something. And I always wanted to thank my mom for giving that lesson to me and my brother.
00:13:58
Mark, is it true that. The family or she built a mock up wall in the backyard to practice climbing over in preparation for the police exam.
00:14:13
Yeah, like I was saying, my dad helped her and he built the whole all the activity she would have to do in our in our backyard, including a wall that was seven foot four inches tall. He actually built it an inch taller without telling her. So she thought she was practicing on a, you know, a seven foot four inch wall and she was practicing on the one that was an inch taller. My dad thinking that might help her on the on the real day when she had this scale, this thing that she would be overly prepared.
00:14:42
Yeah. The first time she went to climb over that, she probably got her foot a foot high, then fell off, fell back into the dirt. But I remember picking herself up, you know, brushing herself off and, you know, just saying, I'm going to just try to touch the top for now. And then, you know, once I can do that, I'll see how long I can hold on for. Maybe someday, eventually I'll be able to do a pull up and quite possibly at the end of the summer, perhaps be able to get over this wall.
00:15:13
You know, some of the other tests was she had to drag a hundred and thirty pound dummy a hundred feet. And we just happened to have a long backyard. I happened to at the time weigh one hundred and thirty pounds and also fit the role as a dummy because I wasn't particularly good at school. So yeah. So with my help in the summer of really hard work on her part and when she went to to take that test, she actually did better than a lot of the men did and became the very first female police officer in my hometown, one of the first in the entire state.
00:15:51
She was off to the races. You you just mentioned school. And that's that's where I want to go next. I think that many people listening have a certain, I suppose, archetypal narrative that they would impose on astronauts in terms of life story. And they see stars, students knocking it out of the park, knowing from the age of three they want to be in space, et cetera. You mentioned you weren't necessarily the best in school. My understanding is you graduated in the bottom half of your high school class and had various sort of misadventures along the way.
00:16:25
What happened in terms, of course, correction, if there was a particular course correction, it was their point at which you learn to study. Was there a catalyzing event for you that reoriented your focus? Yes.
00:16:39
So, you know, most people would would think as an astronaut, you must have been the smartest guy in the class, the overachiever. And that is certainly the case with a lot of my colleagues. I mean, I know folks that I've worked with that saw Neil Armstrong walk on the moon and when they were little kids and decided right then and there, that's what they were going to do. And they did the best at everything from there on out until they became an astronaut and was flying it.
00:17:06
We're flying in space, which is great. I wish I could have done that. I think it's kind of a boring story, though. I think it's much more interesting when it's someone like me who couldn't pay attention in school, spent probably the first 13 years of my education staring out the window, winning. When is this going to be over so I can get out of here? And it was. Felt like it was impossible for me when I was a kid to pay attention, not like I didn't want to, I always went into the new school year with the intention of doing well.
00:17:41
And three days into school, I'd be three days behind and then the rest of the year was just basically on autopilot, not really learning much, not paying attention a whole lot, not getting good grades. I think back then it seemed like it was easier to do that then. I think what I've noticed with my kids today, I don't think you'd be able to get away with, you know, the amount of effort I put in then, but I could just remember it being impossible for me to pay attention, basically having the feeling that if you would have held a gun to my head to force me to pay attention, I wouldn't have been able to do it.
00:18:19
That's how I felt. And I think, you know, I probably have, like, ADD or ADHD never diagnosed. So that's probably why I had such a hard time. And it wasn't until I got to college and I was still, you know, still struggling, didn't know how to study. I really didn't do well. Eventually. I'm not even going to class anymore, or at least much basically, you know, on a fast track of how a lot of kids experience their first year of college, you know, basically one and done, you know, one year and you're done.
00:18:55
And then I was just walking across the college campus, just happened to walk into the bookstore, not to buy a book. I was probably going there to buy gum or some other non educational related thing. Maybe they sold beer there. I don't know. Who knows? But I remember seeing this book on the end of the aisle where they highlight the stuff that they're trying to sell. I think it's called the ANCOP or something of a bookshelf. And, you know, there's this book that had this very patriotic red, white and blue cover.
00:19:32
A cool title, caught my eye, made me pick it up, wasn't a big reader at the time. So it's kind of unusual for me to actually buy a book like that then and read the back. Found it interesting, looked through the first three pages, took my gun money or my beer money or whatever was in the off the book, walked back to my dorm room and then opened it up and basically didn't get out of my bed for the next few days.
00:20:00
Just reading the stories of the fighter pilots, military fighter pilots and test pilots that became the original Mercury, Gemini and Apollo astronauts. And the book was The Right Stuff by Tom Wolfe. You know, something in that book just really sparked my imagination. I think it's probably partly his creative nonfiction writing style that was just really caught my attention and my imagination was the fact that I felt like I could relate to the people in the book, the guys that were he was writing about.
00:20:35
They were all guys at the time. Not anymore. And, you know, obviously a lot of female astronauts now, but back then there was only men and I felt like I had something in common with them and. You know, with regards to like risk taking and putting myself in challenging and risky situations, you know, the the adventure of it really spoke to me, but then I realized I am not a good student. And these guys, you know, most of them went to the military service academies.
00:21:06
I think Pete Conrad went to went to Princeton. I mean, they were very accomplished students before they were pilots. But I thought to myself, you know, if I could just fix that one thing about me, you know, if I could learn how to pay attention and study and do better in school, perhaps I could change colleges, changed majors, become a get an engineering major. The place I was at wasn't quite working out for me and get a commission in the U.S. Navy and go fly fighter planes off of an aircraft carrier, maybe become a test pilot, maybe quite possibly an astronaut someday.
00:21:43
So, you know, that inspiration, I think, is important. That's what I tell kids, that also a lot of parents, you know, if their kids are struggling, I think you can tell them all you want, that they have to do better, but you really have to show them why they need to do better. There has to be that thing, that inspiration, that spark that just provides inspiration to get people moving in the right direction.
00:22:04
And that's what Tom Wolfe's right stuff was for me.
00:22:07
And later, you shot him an email from space with a photograph of yourself with that book.
00:22:13
If I am getting my facts straight, which just is such an incredible full cycle of return to the origin and a sense, again, and incredible prose writer, as you noted, just a wonderful craftsman of of nonfiction. What happened or what did you change after that inspiration? Was it valuable because it aligned your academic focus in a way where you were simply choosing courses that were more oriented towards that path? And that is what helped you to then find a different sort of vector of of progress?
00:22:55
Was it just despite your difficulties with attention? Was it just doubling down because now you had a better reason? What changed?
00:23:06
Well, let me just comment first on you. Were you mentioning that email, which his response was? So Tom Wolfe, like in that he had words in there that were not really words and outrageous punctuation. So it's pretty cool emailed to get that from him. But, you know, in my case, it wasn't really focusing on, like new subjects that more and more in line with being an engineer or pilot, because those were really the subjects I had the most challenge with, like math.
00:23:40
As an example, I wasn't really a great math student or actually I wasn't great at anything. But for me, it wasn't necessarily like a change, of course, or like you said, a vector doubling. It was more than doubling down on the fact that no matter how hard I've tried in the past, that didn't work. And I just have to try a lot harder to force myself to learn how to learn really was the first challenge of the next year after I read Tom's book and I decided that this is what I'm going to do, I yeah, I just had to do it kind of brute force method by myself.
00:24:19
I think they would have a lot more help diagnosed ADD or ADHD. You would be there would be ways to get support and assistance. But for me, strictly the brute force method, like seeing myself to my desk, don't move until I can figure out how to do this precalculus problem. I remember that being a big struggle with the school I was at, but eventually, you know, like, like many things. You know what I what I have always found in my career, whether it's in the military, in the Navy, you know, flying airplanes, whether it's at NASA.
00:24:54
And that is how good we are when we start something is not related at all to how good we can become at anything.
00:25:03
When did you first and maybe you just had the confidence from the get go after reading Tom's book, was there a point after you chain yourself to the desk, you double and triple down with this brute force method? Was there a particular point where you thought to yourself. I can actually do this I. I believe that I can forge a path that will take me to where I want to go.
00:25:31
Well, I don't know if confidence is the right word. I don't I've always felt that kind of like a below average guy performing at an above average level. And I think that's a good place to be, because if you get too confident, I think you get lazy. And, you know, once I figured out what I needed to do, I always felt like I needed to work harder than other people because maybe I didn't have as much natural smarts or talent or ability.
00:26:01
So there was never a moment where I ever got confident. There was kind of a turning point. And that is from a learning and education perspective. And that is eventually I figured out how to study well enough that I was able to change schools. I changed majors, I became an engineering major. But now I'm starting my freshman year all over again, but still haven't really cracked the code on what it takes. It was coming up on Columbus Day.
00:26:27
I went to a school called the State University in New York Maritime College in the Bronx. It's a college that has a military regimented system, which I felt like I had to have that. So that was the primary reason I went there. The other reason was it was really one of the few places I could get into such bad high school grades in my first year. College grades weren't all that great, but I needed that kind of discipline and structure.
00:26:53
I felt like I did. My brother, who was on a completely different trajectory once we went into high school, was at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and asked me a little bit later how he became on upon a different trajectory, because it's actually kind of a funny story. But he was across the river, actually, the Long Island Sound at the US Merchant Marine Academy. And he was a year went up a year ahead of me because I took that first year Mulligan on college.
00:27:23
But we were coming up on the Columbus Day weekend. So it's kind of the beginning of the school year almost. And I call my brother up and I say, hey, some of our friends are having a. A frat party at Rutgers, some of our high school friends and I was thinking of going there for the whole weekend, you know, leave on Friday, come back on Monday, and I called my brother and said, hey, you want to go with me?
00:27:45
And he's like, I got some work to do. I get some tests next week. And then he says goes. Hey, have you have any tests yet, like a calculus test? That was my first year at calculus and I said now we have one next week. And then he like immediately like cursing at me, yelled at me and basically said, what the hell are you doing? I mean, you've never been good at this. You have this motivation to, like, change your path in life and you're thinking about going to a frat party and spending the weekend at a at a frat house.
00:28:22
And I go, yeah, well, you know, the tests at the end of the week of study on, you know, when I get back, he says to me, he goes, you should be doing every single problem in every chapter multiple times until you can't stand it anymore, because that's what it's going to take. And I remember thinking to myself, I'm not too sure I'm going to listen to him. I actually really wanted to go to this frat party.
00:28:47
And but I decided he had gotten good grades through high school and was doing very well where he was in college. And I thought, well, maybe I'll listen to my twin brother after he was yelling and cursing at me on the phone. And, yeah, I did what he said. And then at the end of the week, I took the test and I got a hundred. And then from then on, I basically knew what it took to do well.
00:29:11
And that is for me, what has always taken for me is just no as much as you can about anything you're doing. And then even if you fall a little bit short, you're still not going to fall so far that you're failing or doing poorly.
00:29:28
Yeah, that story also makes me think of someone I know named Jersey Gregory Peck. He's a Polish born Olympic weightlifting champion, has a few world records and his expression is easy choices, hard life, hard choices, easy life.
00:29:47
So I've been flashing back, choosing to.
00:29:53
Do those problem sets three, four times instead of going to the frat party, I mean, that's sort of a seems like a defining example of the hard choice, at least the emotionally hard choice. I'd like to ask you about failure and how you relate to failure. That's I'm going to take a take a left turn, because I know you've spoken a lot about space. This doesn't have to be space specific. It could be related to it, of course.
00:30:17
But how is it how would you say a failure or apparent failure has set you up for later success? In other words, do you have any favorite failure in retrospect that in some respect kind of planted the seeds for a greater success later?
00:30:35
Well, you know, failure is an option. I think it's something that we all probably experience and hopefully we learn from it and move forward. Certainly my early education was one big failure after another. I'm not proud of that. I wish I could have a do over. It's actually one of the greatest regrets of my life, and that is sitting in class for 13 years, not paying attention. You know, talk about a colossal waste of time.
00:31:08
I wish I get out of a do over on that, you know, other failures that would set me up for success. The first time I qualified to land an F 14 Tomcat on the ship, I disqualified my first landing, the hook of the airplane. The Tailhook actually hit the back of the aircraft carrier, the stern, you know, the part that goes down towards the water. And I was one and done on that sent home, you know, had a stern talking to I was given an option of actually going to fly a cargo plane that the commanding officer thought, well, maybe that would be easier for me because my first experience of the ship was so ugly.
00:31:50
But, you know, I was given another chance. And, you know, in this situation, I just thought to myself, I'd never flown a big airplane before. I didn't even know if I could do that. But I thought, you know, if I'm going to fail at something, I might as well fail at something that I think I might not be able to do rather than right. And that's easier because at least this way, you kind of know what you're where you stand.
00:32:14
You like what you're capable of. I always feel like if we're not always moving that bar higher and risking a failure, then we're not really reaching our potential. And the people I've come across, not only at NASA, the military and industry are the people that are really successful, are the people that are willing to take the risk of failing. And oftentimes I'll come across kids or adults that they don't want to do something because they think they might not be able to do it.
00:32:50
But what if they are able to? They would never know. So to put yourself out there, to expose yourself to failure, I think is something that everyone should strive for, because if they don't, they're never going to be able to see what they could possibly achieve now. Now, hopefully the risk taking I'm talking about is not something that would get you killed. It almost got me killed on a number of occasions. But, yeah, hopefully it's not those kind of risks, but career risk, you know, other kind of risks and putting yourself out there for maybe getting a degree.
00:33:31
You don't think you're capable of applying for a job. You think you might not get those kind of risks or something? I think people should be challenging themselves like that all the time.
00:33:40
It makes me think of this quote from Larry Page, the co-founders of Google, that I'm paraphrasing here, but he often observes that something that's easy to miss is that if you aim really big, it's quite difficult to fail completely. Now, there are examples, certainly within the context of flying where that does not apply. But in a lot of these other areas, like you mentioned, career decisions, etc., even if you fail, meaning you don't reach your objective, there could be a lot of carryover benefits that you don't get if you aim really small.
00:34:12
But let's go back to A14 Tomcat. How fast are you moving?
00:34:17
When you land such a plan, I know it's variable because it's changing as you're on the approach, but yeah, what's the range of speed as you're my understanding is the A14 Tomcat is about 50 feet wide. And how wide is the aircraft carrier or the landing portion?
00:34:34
I'm not sure how wide the landing area is, but it's not much wider than the airplane.
00:34:44
You don't have a whole lot of margin. The airplane lands. It depends on the weight, what weight you're landing at, but it's somewhere around one hundred and fifty miles an hour. Not the fastest landing on the ship. You have to land relatively. So the 38 that we flew at NASA would land it like one hundred and seventy knots. So the 14 is a little bit slower. But the thing about the Tomcat or any airplane that's landing on the ship is not only are you trying to land on this very small runway, but that runway is constantly moving up and down, heaving up and down.
00:35:19
It's pitching about a stern is rolling left to right, and it's moving away from you because the deck is angled as a ship is going forward. So and then sometimes it's dark. So you can't really see anything either. So it's pretty challenging piloting task, actually. It's harder than landing the space shuttle, believe it or not. Difference with the space shuttle is you're not feeling well. You're dizzy, you might be nauseous. You don't have a second chance in that.
00:35:50
It's a glider, a big glider with very poor flying qualities. And you're only going to get to do this once or twice in your life. You know, everyone's watching you. So it's a lot a lot of pressure, different kind of pressure in the 14.
00:36:07
Just a quick thanks to one of our sponsors, and we'll be right back to the show. This episode is brought to you by athletic greens. I get asked all the time what I would take if I could only take one supplement. The answer is invariably athletic greens. I view it as all in one nutritional insurance. I recommended it, in fact, in the four hour body, this is more than 10 years ago and I did not get paid to do so.
00:36:29
With approximately 75 vitamins, minerals and Whole Foods sourced ingredients, you'd be very hard pressed to find a more nutrient dense and comprehensive formula on the market. It has multivitamins, multi mineral greens, complex probiotics and probiotics for gut health, an immunity formula. Digestive enzymes adapt to genes and much more. I usually take it once or twice a day just to make sure I've covered my bases. If I missed anything I'm not aware of. Of course, I focus on nutrient dense meals to begin with.
00:36:57
That's the basis. But athletic greens makes it easy to get a lot of nutrition when Whole Foods aren't readily available from travel packets. I always have them in my bag when I'm zipping around. And right now athletic greens is giving my audience, that's you guys, a special offer on top of their all in one formula, which is a free vitamin D supplement with your first subscription purchase. Many of us are deficient in vitamin D, which is usually produced in our bodies from sun exposure.
00:37:22
So particularly in the winter months, adding a vitamin D supplement to your daily routine is a great option for additional immune support. So make an investment in your health today and try the ultimate all in one wellness bundle. Support your immunity, gut health and energy by visiting athletic greens dotcom tim, you'll receive up to a year's supply of vitamin D for free with your first subscription purchase. Again, that's athletic greens dotcom Tim.
00:37:50
Aside from your own books, what are the books that you've given the most as gifts to other people, and why do any come to mind that you've given to more than one person? I'm looking at my bookshelf in my office here. You know, certainly the right stuff. I've given that to people. Shackleton's or Alfred Lansing's book, Endurance, which is partly where the name of my book Endurance comes from, because that book about Ernest Shackleton and his voyage with his crew of Endurance, the ship to the Antarctic in the beginning of the last century, was really one of the greatest examples of leadership in a very challenging and dangerous environment that I could ever imagine.
00:38:46
I mean, it's just extraordinary what Shackleton, as the leader of that expedition, was able to do when their ship Endurance got stuck in the ice, eventually crushed. And they spent I forget exactly how long, but it was almost like two years saving themselves that involved, you know, living on ice packs and transits of hundreds and hundreds of miles and lifeboats in the Arctic, a crossing of South Georgia Island in the winter that no one had ever done before.
00:39:21
But Shackleton and a small team of his guys did that, as at the end of them trying to save themselves. And he was able to do that. And no one died. None of his crew members died. Everyone survived. That book is very meaningful book for me that I have actually given it to other people. Hemingway fans, certainly, you know, the old men in the sea is a favorite. And I'm also looking at Pearl Buck's The Good Earth.
00:39:51
I think I've given that book to other people.
00:39:54
What is the good earth about? Yes, so it's about Pearl Box, the Gerner. It's brilliant, it's about this guy name, this farmer in China, this peasant farmer that I haven't read it in a long time, but think his name is Wang Lung. He goes from peasant farmer and survives all these famines and eventually becomes a major land holder. Really a great book, incredibly well written and a great example of like what life was like in that time during China, before the revolution and when they had many, many years of famine and, you know, having massive numbers of people having to migrate as a result.
00:40:36
Highly recommended one of my favorites of all time. That is a non-fiction or fiction. It's nonfiction. Let's talk about scientific literacy for a few minutes. Yeah, so. So I'm not a scientist. I support a lot of science. I have a basic level of I would consider it scientific literacy.
00:41:00
There is a lot of froth and noise out in the world today, certainly magnified by social media and so on in many respects. Could you speak to what happened with respect to Steph Curry and the moon landing? Because this may be an entry point for.
00:41:21
Discussing how people can develop the greater ability to separate fact from fiction, I'll tell you what, I'm not a scientist either, although I do play one on TV occasionally and I do other you know, a lot of people think you're an astronaut, you must be a scientist. Now, I'm not a scientist. I've I've done a lot of science. I think I'm a science minded person. I know what science is. I know what it isn't. And unfortunately, I think in today's society, a lot of people have lost their reality in some ways where all of a sudden in our society, like science is now opinion or politics.
00:42:07
It's not it's subjective. Observation is evidence is experimentation. It's critical analysis. It's peer review. It's always evolving, but it is the truth as we know it. At that particular time, the science deniers we have in our society now are dangerous. It's like I used to kind of goof around with the flat earth years now. I don't even, like, acknowledge their existence. And I probably shouldn't even have brought them up because I don't believe that they should even be given any kind of acknowledgement because it's just so absolutely outrageous.
00:42:43
It's like if you're a flat earth or, well, why don't you just deny that the sun is in the sky? I mean, the earth is round. I mean, you can go up in an airplane and look out the window and see that it's round. You've got to look pretty closely because you're not very high. But if you do look closely, you can see we lived on a curve planet, not to mention that thousands of years of science as determined that the earth is round.
00:43:08
And of course, I've seen it from space and it is pretty round. It's not flat. There was. And if it was flat, wouldn't the edge be like the most popular tourist attraction on Earth? I would just go set up like a taco truck and make a billion dollars with my, you know, Edge of the Earth tacos. Yeah. So I generally don't give those kind of folks any acknowledgement because I just think it's so outrageous. And I know some of them do it kind of as a goof and they think it's funny or it's cute or whatever.
00:43:42
Some people really believe it. The danger is if you're willing to believe that the earth is flat, what else are you willing to believe that vaccines don't work, that we are not living in a pandemic where people by the thousands are dying every day throughout, you know, around the world that climate change is a hoax. So it's a it's a risky thing. You know, with regards to Steph, Steph is an awesome guy. I think he's a smart guy.
00:44:10
I think in his situation, he just kind of got caught up in one in a thing where he said he just agreed with somebody about the moon landings, probably would not even given it a whole lot of thought. And then he got a lot of heat for it. And I felt bad for him because I like him. I'm a fan. So I just reached out to him and I said, hey, you know, if you want to talk about the moon landing, I'd be happy to share what I know with you.
00:44:33
And he was very happy to have that conversation and to take back is what he said about that, because and I and he he wasn't doing anything malicious. He was just kind of agreeing with the guy, a guy who said that, and he was kind of on to the next thing. But a lot of people gave him a lot of effort. So we had a little talk about it.
00:44:53
I think he understands now, if we look at the spectrum of let's just call it sort of scientific, not scientific thinking, but sort of detached on some level, rational skepticism, et cetera, the ability to navigate the world into the best of our ability, separate fact from fiction. It does. Seem to me that there are people out there who are not let's just say flat earth is right or people who are trying to convince you of God knows what that is, just seems clearly at face value ridiculous to the people in the middle who really don't know how to best discern what is true and what is not.
00:45:41
And I think vaccines are a great example in the sense that I have many friends who I would consider in many, many domains to be very smart, high performing, effective people who do not even know where to begin with vaccines, just in terms of claims from friends, certainly different sites on their Facebook friends that are claiming to be expert on this stuff.
00:46:07
Yeah, or they or those Facebook friends link to a site that seems to have citations. And they just I mean, I, I will just say, like these people I'm talking about, some of them are not they're not people I would consider broadly stupid people at all.
00:46:20
So how can someone who wants to become more discerning and capable in sifting through the noise become better attuned? Do you have any suggestions for how they can cultivate that? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I'm not an expert on many, many things. And, you know, there are things that I know a lot about, things I don't know a whole lot of about. But when I don't know about those, I asked the rocket scientist of whatever that thing is.
00:46:51
I get my information from trusted sources, government agencies that are the authority on the pandemic, like the CDC, the World Health Organization, these kind of places, media outlets that have been there for a long time and that have a reputation, not your crazy uncle on Facebook, not people you've never heard of. So this is shocking to me that people will just discount things that are the truth without even trying to go find out what the real story is and just saying, well, I just don't believe.
00:47:29
I don't believe that. I don't believe that. Yeah, you don't have to be a scientist to understand science. And even if you don't understand it, you know, find the person that's the expert and believe them because they're the experts. Right. Let's talk about something that you are, I would think, very qualified to comment on. And that is. Possible future missions to Mars. I would love to just hear your thoughts on the feasibility or attractiveness of future missions to Mars, in part because there are many diverging opinions here.
00:48:06
You have, for instance, you have Elon Musk on one side of the spectrum. You have then also people like Jeff Bezos, who I believe have publicly said, you know, the last thing you want to do is have to deal with gravity and the environment on Mars. Like once you get into space, you want to build communities in space as opposed to on another planet for a host of different reasons. And if you you mentioned Shackleton, if you like the idea of being on Mars, you should try living in Antarctica for a few months and then let me know how you feel, since that's pretty temperate and forgiving compared to the ecosystem on Mars or the climate at least.
00:48:46
How would you suggest people think about or how do you think about missions to Mars?
00:48:52
Yeah, so, you know, a few things come to mind, you know, one and one is and I'll quote my brother and give him credit for this because he said it. And that's the only place I've ever heard this. And he says going to Mars is not about rocket science. It's really about political science because, you know, we know much of what we need to know technically about how to do it. But if we're going to really do that someday, put people, put boots on Mars, it's really more about having the money, the political support and the public support.
00:49:25
It's going to take people to vote in to office science minded people that feel like this is important. You know, I do think we can do it. We could probably do it pretty soon. There are some challenges. I think we need better life. You know, our life support systems probably need to be a little bit more robust. We certainly have to protect the crew from radiation, whether we have some protective materials or we just get to Mars quicker so they're not exposed to radiation for that long.
00:49:58
But it's something that we're absolutely capable of doing and I think we should do. I don't think, though, we need to look at Mars as a lifeboat for planet Earth. Now, I see that having been wrong about things that Elon has said before. So, you know, when he was going to land his the first stage of the Falcon rocket on a ship and reuse it, my initial thought was he's crazy. But then he went and did it and he did it again and again and again and again.
00:50:27
So I will never say he wants crazy again, but I always think it'll be easier to live on Earth regardless of what bad thing might happen to it. And I also think it's important that we need to recognize that really this is our home. We need to take care of it. We're not going to move the whole planet to Mars. I think it's important to go to Mars and, you know, establish a foothold. It's great that we've had a foothold in space.
00:50:52
We're coming up on the twenty year anniversary of having people in space continuously. So kids that are alive today have never been on planet Earth with everybody else. And I think we should continue to do that. I think we should go to Mars someday. I think we should have people living on Mars. But I don't look at it as a plan B, necessary planet B kind of thing. Yeah, I do think this planet could be pretty well destroyed and I don't think we should do that.
00:51:20
But it could be and it would still be easier than living on Mars, living here.
00:51:25
What are the most compelling arguments for the importance of getting people to Mars? Or simply asked, why do you think it is important? Because it would involve, of course, very significant cost.
00:51:38
Yeah, I think going to Mars is, you know, it's going to be expensive, but that expenses paid with, you know, very high paying jobs that. Recently, there was this NASA study that talked about the return on investment, so, you know, NASA is a moneymaking prospect in that it generates more tax dollars than it it uses a mission to Mars would be the same thing. A mission to Mars would develop technologies that we may not have today.
00:52:11
Maybe it won't. I don't know. It may it may not. It will definitely push the envelope of what we are technically capable of doing. I think it would be a great way to cooperate internationally. You know, we have a lot of conflict here on Earth, but we've been flying on that space station with the Russians for the last 20 years. And it gives countries that are sometimes in conflict with each other a place to work on something that is peaceful, that benefits everybody.
00:52:39
I think that we're explorers. I think it's in our nature DNA. I don't think we would have developed to be the species we are today if we didn't explore. I think it's part of who we are and we should continue to do it. And then I think if everything I said was wrong, the fact that that kind of mission, that going to Mars, going to the moon, the space station, the space shuttle, the space program in general, it inspires kids not only in the United States but around the world to be better students, to study math and science and stem careers, to be better at those in those areas of study that are so, so important to our economy.
00:53:24
Because all those people, all those kids around the world that are so inspired by NASA, they're not going to work for NASA. I mean, some of them will, but all of them aren't. They're going to go into other fields that contribute to our economy, our society and our way of life. And if that's all we got out of it, that's worth every penny. I mean, if the six or whatever billion dollars we spend a year on human spaceflight, if the only thing we got out of that is that kind of inspiration for our kids, which I don't think it's the only thing we get out of it.
00:53:50
But if it was worth every cent here, here. Thank you for that answer. Let's talk about Go for lunch. It's a subtitle, How to Dream Lead in Chief. This is your two hour audio course on Knowable. Why did you. Produce this audio course and what do you hope people will gain from it? You know, I think my my life story has a lot of lessons in it that I think will help other people and inspire other people that they can do things that maybe they didn't think they were capable of.
00:54:24
They can take risk. They can challenge themselves. They can. I'm hoping that people will look at this as a way to find maybe more success in their own lives. And I've done that with the public speaking. I do. I've done it with the books that I've written. And this is just a new way of reaching a different audience. I didn't really didn't know much about Knowable before I was approached to do this, but when I learned about it, I was like, hey, that's a really good idea.
00:54:50
You know, people like to listen to books on tape now, especially a lot more recently. And why not listen to something that is not a book but has a particular lessons from different kinds of people. So for those that don't know unknowables, it's a it's a new app that gives exclusive audio courses from different types of experts. Chris Paul is one of them, Alexis Ohanian, me, a bunch of other people. It's basically kind of like listening to Spotify, but it's for learning something.
00:55:27
And hopefully people will learn something that will help in their lives. From the audio course I was able to put together, they can find this course on knowable dot f why I forward slash Scott. At least that's what they told me, where you can find it. Oh, but you said that, right? And yeah, I hope people enjoy it. There's some humor in there. It's a couple of jokes every now and then. I hope people find them funny and I hope they enjoy it.
00:56:00
And we'll link to that also for everybody in the show notes. And that's heavily trafficked at Timna blog FORGETTIN. So we'll link to everything, including Noble that I got for folks.
00:56:12
Just maybe two more questions and then we can bring this round one to a close.
00:56:19
Round one, round two.
00:56:23
I always want you know, I like saying round one week.
00:56:26
I could say this conversation, but if it gives you more anxiety that you enjoy, I could say this is round one of 17 to the forthcoming indefinite series with Scott Kelly. This is this is the end of the conversation.
00:56:39
So I always like to say round one, just in case there is around two right there when you said I'm out.
00:56:47
Understandable. Understandable to two questions. The first is and these are sometimes dead ends and I'll take the blame if they are, but we'll give it a shot. The first is if you could put anything on a gigantic billboard. This is, metaphorically speaking, to get a message or a question, an image, anything out to billions of people. What might you put on that? Something noncommercial right now?
00:57:14
I'd say something like, science is real. Believe it. Yeah, science is real, believe it. Yeah, what a world we live in. Yeah, right.
00:57:24
We have to imagine Galileo coming or Newton coming to this this world now. They would lose their minds.
00:57:33
Yeah. The I saw a cartoon at the beginning of the pandemic which featured this guy. Clearly, that's sort of the husband and wife couple and the husband sitting at his computer and he says, honey, it's amazing. Last week, all of my friends on Facebook were constitutional lawyers, and this week they're all epidemiologists in their search for the signal folks.
00:57:57
All right. The second question is, and this might seem like a bizarre question, but I'm curious, when is the last time you cried?
00:58:05
Tears of joy that you remember? This might be an answer you're not expecting or weird, but I don't think I ever have maybe ever. Yeah, I don't think so. Tears of joy. No, I'm not I'm not I'm not much of a crier. There's no crying in space, no crying in space, crying in baseball, people. All right.
00:58:33
Well, Scott, is there anything that you would like to say, just his closing comments, any recommendations or asks of the audience that you would like to add before we close?
00:58:42
Well, you know, certainly I think, you know, having this platform and an opportunity to speak to your viewers, and that is we're living in some really crazy times right now. And I've had the privilege to see people work in some really challenging environments and the things that that are very risky things that you might not even believe is possible. And we're able to be successful. Success requires teamwork. And I think our country just needs to realize that we just have to start working together.
00:59:15
I mean, we can't live in this divided society where people are in conflict with one another because we have some serious challenges. In the way you meet those challenges is with teamwork. And that has been my experience my whole career at NASA. And I just wish more people would just kind of come together, identify problems, do it in a thoughtful way, believe in science, solve those problems and then move on to the next thing. And I'm just very hopeful that we can get there and hopefully get there soon.
00:59:46
Science is real, believe it. And this is a great place to end. Scott, thank you so much for taking the time today. I know this is a long form conversation and I appreciate you carving out the time to have a chat and to share your life lessons and to answer my sometimes obvious, sometimes peculiar or sometimes in the middle questions. So thank you very much for carving out some space to do this. Hey, thanks for having me, Tim.
01:00:13
I very much enjoyed it. Thank you. And to everybody listening, if I show notes, links to everything we've discussed. Tim Dopp blog, Forward Slash podcast, you can find the noble course at Noble Dot, FYI for Scott and until next time, thanks for tuning in. I'm grateful that throughout my 20 years at NASA, I had the chance to work with a wide variety of people from different backgrounds. I flew in space with a French engineer, a schoolteacher from Idaho, a Swiss astrophysicist, and more Russian cosmonauts than I can count.
01:00:52
He spoke different languages, believe different things. Problem solved in different ways. And when you're trying to do something as challenging as flying in space, you need as many different strengths as you can get.
01:01:03
And then I met Cady when I was preparing for my first long duration spaceflight.
01:01:10
I was slated to overlap for a majority of the hundred and fifty nine days with Cady Coleman.
01:01:17
Cady was a military officer in the Air Force, a chemist. She was a veteran of two space shuttle missions, just like me. But Cady and I were as different as two military officers can be. In fact, some of our colleagues were seriously concerned that we might kill each other for months. We would have to cooperate and live together in a space the size of the inside of a 747 filled with stuff.
01:01:42
So when Cady first arrived, I could see why people had been worried.
01:01:47
Cady did an entirely live her life by schedules, and I would often find her in the little window filled module called the cupola, looking at the earth and playing her flute at three o'clock in the morning.
01:02:02
Throughout the workday, I always knew what Katie was working on because she would leave experiments and projects have done or there would be scraps and remnants of her activities just floating around.
01:02:13
I used to call it a Katie Trout.
01:02:18
But whatever else she needed to do, Katie always made time to speak with people on the ground, especially schoolchildren, even beyond the many events that NASA schedules us for.
01:02:28
Hi, my name is Sheikh, and my question is how to dispose trash on a space station check. You have an excellent question for exactly this week. It is very difficult. We can't.
01:02:38
She made time for art and music, even playing the first Earth space duet on her flute with the founder of the band, Jethro Tull.
01:02:52
It was one more aspect of our personalities that couldn't be more different. I had always seen the public relations part of my job as a nuisance. It needed to be done because the public has a right to know what's being done with their tax dollars and to feel involved in the space program. But I'm not a newscaster or YouTube and I didn't really enjoy being pressed into service is one. I felt that my job was to command the space station, carry out the many complex procedures and experiments I was tasked with to run a tight ship to keep my crew safe and obviously to keep everything from exploding.
01:03:28
One day we had a standard public affairs interview. Here's what I sounded like, answering questions in my factual, straightforward. Are we done yet, Tony?
01:03:36
We got up here about a little over a hundred and something days ago, not that I'm counting, but felt like I picked up just where I left off last time.
01:03:47
This was not my favorite part of the day. Later, Katie confronted me. She said, you know, if you don't sound excited about what we're doing up here, no one else will be either. She was right.
01:03:59
I learned a lot by watching Katie. And by the time I flew a year long mission on the space station, you could certainly hear the difference.
01:04:06
And you actually packed a gorilla suit and your gear, which is incredible.
01:04:10
You know, it's interesting when you vacuum pack something, it doesn't take up a whole lot of room. And, you know, for one, when you try to get kids attention and and teach them about science and math and engineering and things like that, the first thing you have to do is get their attention. And nothing gets people's attention like a gorilla in space. By this time I'd figured out Twitter and Instagram. I've been building up the year and space hashtag.
01:04:39
I did a Reddit AMA. I showed off the first flower regrew in space. I played water ping pong and had a Super Bowl party. For one, I juggled fruit, which is still impressive, even though the fruit just kind of hangs there. I also explained how I had to clean up a gallon sized ball of urine and acid. I explained that space smells like burning metal and that my favorite David Bowie song is not Space Oddity, but probably under pressure.
01:05:09
It wasn't what I thought I had been trained for, but this kind of work was able to bring all kinds of people into the experience of our mission and bring them closer to science, engineering and the amazing things we accomplished when we all work together.
01:05:23
But it was Katie with her flute and are always positive attitude that made that possible.
01:05:29
We all learned a lot from each other up there in training to fly in the Russian spacecraft.
01:05:34
I spent a lot of time in Russia getting to know the culture and learning to speak the language. Not very well, I might add.
01:05:40
I've had the chance to get to know Russian literature and history in a way I never expected. There's always potential for conflict and challenges, particularly with the Russians. Our countries are not always the friendliest.
01:05:51
I guess you could call us frenemies, but in space, you set all that aside because we rely on those cosmonauts and they rely on us.
01:06:00
Space is a great place to do that because no one owns and it's a common ground where peaceful scientific collaboration can occur.
01:06:11
I've learned from my colleagues who grew up in different cultures, practice different religions, and we're born with different sexual orientations. It's only been very recently that NASA has recruited astronauts who openly acknowledge a same sex partner. And I hope to see a transgender astronaut in my lifetime. I have a transgender son who is one of the smartest and kindest people I have ever had the privilege of knowing, and it would be a loss to NASA if they didn't choose to include people like him among their ranks someday.
01:06:48
In retrospect, I think the people who told Katie and me we kill each other in space underestimated both of us and overlook the power of our differences. I try to keep this in mind when I see people who seem very different working together. And I want to encourage them to see their differences as strengths and what we referred to in the military as a force multiplier. Katie and I are now lifelong friends, and when I think of the mission we flew together.
01:07:14
I hope she remembers as fondly as I do the times.
01:07:17
I'd find her playing her flute in the cupola and couldn't help but tell her, Katie, go to sleep. It's a school night. I don't care if you're friends with Jethro Tull. Sometimes people are incentivized to dodge blame or even cover up their mistakes, and I've seen this in action as well. The Russian space agency has a very different way of managing and compensating their cosmonauts than NASA does its astronauts. And part of that has to do with how blame is distributed.
01:07:55
Both astronauts and cosmonauts are paid extra when they are flying in space. In the case of the cosmonauts, they get a significant bonus of somewhere between three hundred and fifty to 700 US dollars per day, depending on how experienced they are.
01:08:10
So for someone like my friend Gennady, who has spent eight hundred and seventy nine days in space, that can really add up. By contrast, American astronauts are paid the government per diem rate five dollars per day.
01:08:23
But our salaries are much higher to begin with, which means we are less dependent on that bonus for our livelihoods than the cosmonauts are, which is where the problem comes in.
01:08:36
Cosmonauts are given higher bonuses for their achievements, like a successful spacewalk and lower bonuses to reflect mistakes for flipping the wrong switch, missing a step in an experiment or similar everyday human errors.
01:08:50
And you might not believe this, but there's actually a real person in Russian mission control whose only job is to track the mistakes of cosmonauts.
01:08:59
And when each cosmonaut comes back to Earth, they have to sit in a room with the mistake tracker and an accountant to determine what their bonus is going to be.
01:09:12
I've experienced firsthand the way this sort of negotiation is supposed to work.
01:09:16
When I was preparing to fly on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, I trained with my crewmates in a simulator, much like the simulators I've trained on in Houston to fly the space shuttle. After our final simulation flights in Russia, we would have to answer to a panel of Russian space agency officials about our performance, kind of a public stoning, I would call it.
01:09:40
It took me a while to understand that we were actually expected to create an elaborate excuse matrix about how we hadn't done anything wrong, how everything was somebody else's fault, and that no blame should be attached to us. I came to think of this practice as blame smithing, and some people were quite skilled at it, bending the narrative of events to always move the blame away from you and towards some other poor bastard.
01:10:09
I was terrible at this, but that was fine with me. And I think it annoyed the Russians that during the public stoning, when it was my turn to make an impassioned speech about how I didn't flip the wrong switch, I just say, yep, that was me. Now, once we were in space, the question of blame got real for my Russian friends. They were always dealing with the possibility of losing their income to the smallest mistakes.
01:10:33
So I tell them to blame me. As far as I could see it, it was a win win, they wouldn't lose their bonus and their control center wouldn't spend a day trying to figure out what went wrong because they were avoiding responsibility. Real teamwork means it's crucial for everyone to admit their mistakes. If you want to solve problems, move fast and make sure everyone is doing their best. You can't punish people for speaking up. That's true in space, but it applies any time anywhere.
01:11:01
In my experience as a space shuttle crew member and later as commander of the International Space Station, I learned how important this was on the space shuttle.
01:11:10
If I had actuated the wrong switch at the wrong moment, always a possibility with 2000 of them, I might have caused a hundred people in mission control to spend hours or even days trying to figure out why their data looked funny and not focusing on what is important.
01:11:26
It's so much better to just be honest and move on, and if that doesn't work, you can always say the American did it.
01:11:33
