This episode is brought to you by Oura oh, you are a it is the only wearable that I wear on a daily basis, or is the company behind the smart ring that delivers personalized sleep and health insights to help you optimize just about everything? And I've tried every device out there that you can imagine. This one really makes the cut. I've been using it religiously for at least six months now, and I was introduced to it by Dr. Peter Attia, who's also vetted just about everything with advanced sensors or a state of the art, heart rate, heart rate variability.
00:02:05
H.V. Super important to me, temperature activity and sleep monitoring technology into a convenient, non-invasive ring. It's tiny. It weighs less than six grams and focuses on three key insights sleep readiness and activity. So I can use it to help focus my attention on the type, volume, intensity of exercise that I should do in a given day. I use it to determine how certain types of alcohol at different times of the day affect my sleep, which they do.
00:02:32
And I can see all of that in graph form trended over time. There are tons of actionable insights that have come from using this ring for me. They have a number of incredible people on their team. Dr. Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at UC Berkeley and also author of Why We Sleep. The mega hit is or as chief science adviser, as just one example. The Oring is one of the most accurate wearables available because it measures your vitals directly from your finger.
00:03:02
So it's not deducing that or making a best guesstimate based on a bunch of other things and trying to triangulate compared to a medical grade electrocardiogram. The ordering is ninety nine point nine percent accurate for resting heart rate and ninety eight point four percent accurate for heart rate variability. And I work with HRB doctors and they recommend that I use the ordering. So try it yourself. It is super cool and super practical, very actionable. The ordering comes in two styles and three colors silver, black and matte black.
00:03:35
I use matte black for two hundred and ninety nine dollars. You can give or get the gift of health by visiting Aura Ring Dotcom. That's Ostara RISC NORCOM again. That's Oura ring dotcom. This episode is brought to you by Vieri clothing spelled View R I've Yori, I've been wearing Vieri at least one item per day for the last few months and you can use it for everything. It's performance apparel, but it can be used for working out. It can be used for going out to dinner.
00:04:14
At least in my case. I feel very comfortable with it. Super comfortable, super stylish. And I just want to read something that one of my employees said. She is an athlete. She is quite technical, although she would never say that. I asked her if she had ever used or heard of Vieri and this was her response. I do love their stuff. Been using them for about a year. I think I found them at RPI first for my partner T-shirts that are super soft, but somehow last as he's hard on stuff.
00:04:42
And then I got into the super soft cotton yoga pants and jogger sweatpants. I live in them and they too have lasted. They're stylish enough. I can wear them out and about. The material is just super soft and durable. I just got there Clementine running shorts for summer and love them. The brand seems pretty popular, constantly sold out inclosing and I'm abbreviating here but inclosing with the exception of when I need technical outdoor gear. They're the only brand I bought in the last year or so for yoga running loungewear that lasts and that I think, look good.
00:05:10
Also, I like the discrete logo, so that gives you some idea that was not intended for the sponsor ID. That was just her response via text vieri against. Oh, our eye is designed for maximum comfort and versatility. You can wear running, you can wear their stuff training, doing yoga, lounging weekend errands or in my case again going out to dinner. It really doesn't matter what you're doing. Their clothing is so comfortable and looks so good and it's, it's not offensive.
00:05:41
You don't have a huge brand logo on your face. You just want to be in them all the time. And my girlfriend and I have been wearing them for the last few months. Their men's core shortcode are the most comfortable lined athletic shirt. Is your one short for every sport? I've been using it for kettlebell swings, for runs, you name it. The Banks short.

00:07:20
At this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. Can I ask you a question now at the scene? I'm a cybernetic organism, living tissue, metal and the skeleton made in Paris, so. DACs, welcome to the show. Thanks for making time. Yes, thanks for having me. It might be fun for people to even know why we're talking.
00:07:51
Well, let's see, it originated with a mention in my newsletter five Friday, a very complimentary, very complimentary and very well deserved way related to an episode of your podcast, Armchair Expert, in which you interviewed Atul Gawande, who I've respect for a very long time, author of many books, including The Checklist Manifesto.
00:08:21
And it was one of those episodes that I come across every once in a while where I think to myself, I should have interviewed that guy first because I don't think I'm actually going to be adding much to the conversation by having a second interview unless I just jump straight to the rapid fire questions. You know, if you're a breakfast cereal, what would you be kind of stuff, right? You did you did an exceptional job.
00:08:46
And it's so flattering. Thank you. And so you reached out. After that, and that's how we connected and we yet, I guess one or two conversations since and here we are in the show.
00:08:59
Yeah, we connected over the phone. And I'll admit to my very I think it's human susceptibility to compliments from high status people. I mean, this is deplorable about me. But, you know, certainly people wrote on that episode on our feed that it was nice and everything and it feels good. But then to see in, you could consider, quote, a competitor on some level.
00:09:21
So or a colleague, I don't know how you want to frame it, but to know that someone else who does what I do listen, didn't like that is is abundantly flattering. I'll sometimes like, you know, I'll reach out to I think we're both friends with Sam Harris. So if there was an episode I loved of his, I'll I'll tell him that and then occasionally go, oh, I really like your. And I'm like, wow, I assume you don't listen.
00:09:42
You would never listen to my show cause you have your own show. So I don't know. It's just it gets elevated quickly for me that you had took the time to listen. When you spend so much time in the podcast world, you probably want a break from it. I have decided that I want to go back to the well and try to work on the craft, and part of that is listening to people who are really good.
00:10:05
And I polled my audience on Twitter to determine which episodes to hone in on.
00:10:12
And that was part of my homework and all.
00:10:15
Yeah, no kidding. Yeah.
00:10:16
And I did that early, early on because I started this podcast and 2014 seems like in the Pliocene era.
00:10:24
And I initially looked at Inside the Actor's Studio and some of these others, Terry Gross also, I think had a similar experience to yourself in the sense that went on WTF with Marc Maron and Joe Rogan, and it was on Nerdist and had such a great time compared to the two minutes of having someone look over your shoulder at a teleprompter for the TV edition.
00:10:48
Yeah, that I decided kind of, you know, kick the tires and try it out, at least for myself.
00:10:53
But it's it seems to me like you have much more so than myself. I mean, skyrocketed to such a a dominant place in some respects with the podcast. And there's a lot to unpack there.
00:11:08
But I thought where we could start is your mom and I'll place some background around that. I've had many friends of mine ask me if I would have my mom or dad on my podcast. Oh, sure.
00:11:22
And they've also suggested that I record episodes with them even if I never release them. And I think there's something to be said for that.
00:11:30
I haven't yet done it. You did have your mom on the podcast, and I would just love to hear you describe why you did that and if it was at all difficult to pull the trigger to do it and publish it. Well, for me, it felt like I should absolutely do it, because that kind of premise of of our show is, look, man, it is hard to get through 80 years on this planet and not fuck up royally often.
00:12:05
And so my mother, just as her I don't know where she got it from, to be honest with you, but she's always had the most compassionate, empathetic point of view. Like an example would be. I lived in a small town. You know, occasionally a young kid would die in a car accident and always drunk driving related. And there would be other people in the car and the whole community be mad at the driver.
00:12:29
And my mother's first thought would always be like, oh, man, what are what are the parents of the boy driving thinking about?
00:12:37
Every baby comes home and cigars are handed out and everyone's excited. And this is just not where it should end for anyone. She always had this knack for kind of taking almost the antagonists in stories and having a great deal of empathy for them. And so however much I'm able to do that on our show, it's directly credited to her for sure.
00:12:57
And this really kind of willingness to own your fuckups in public, like she would tell people, relative strangers, how many times you've been divorced or this or that.
00:13:08
She just didn't seem to she seemed to fight shame with that. And so I just always admired her about that. And I definitely think that's if that's why the podcast work is attributable to her. So it seemed natural to have her on.
00:13:22
But then I had the fear of, you know, my mother is not a public personality. She's not been in interviews.
00:13:28
It's a stressful situation, as you just said. You know, I think people underestimate how much of a like a starter pistol goes off. When you're on one of those talk shows, it's like you're standing behind a door it's about to raise up. You're supposed to walk up to the right and to the left and you shake the guy's hand. Then you sit down, then you let you know it's so quick and like being shot out of a cannon that it's very hard to relax and be yourself out there.
00:13:50
So I had an appropriate amount of fear that she would maybe just not be the person I know once there was a microphone in front of her and then to my great delight, she had no problem with it.
00:14:01
She was just very comfortable right away. And then I think the unforseen thing for me was. The person who does interviews was operating on some level, and so there are obvious things that I would have asked for follow up questions with any other guests that I had never asked my mom. And I guess the one that was probably most profound is. My mom has this incredible story, you know, three divorces started as a gender night shift, built a company, raise three kids on her own.
00:14:33
She's had two suicide attempts. She's wrestled with mental health issues. She had my first stepdad was physically abusive and beat her up in front of us. And it was it was gnarly. And so in she was very comfortable with that. And so she's kind of going through her story. And then it just hit me for the first time. It's something I would ask the real guess, which was not how could someone as tough as you and is confident is you have lived with someone that was beating you up.
00:15:03
It's hard for me to you're not you don't fit the stereotype I have of someone with low self-esteem that would find themselves in that relationship. And she said, again, I've never asked her that. But she said, you know, the shame of having failed twice, I had just got divorced from your dad and I didn't want to tell my parents. And that didn't go easy. And everyone was disappointed and I felt like a failure. And now I picked this other guy and I probably did it haphazardly.
00:15:30
And here I was again.
00:15:31
And I I was I would have preferred to have gotten physically beat up than to own the shame of having failed twice in such a short period of time and.
00:15:41
I think that ended up being one of the most profound things that happened in that I know a lot of women reached out to us and really related to that and have contacted my mom separately about that. And and so, yeah, that was a neat part of it that I never thought to really ask her in real life. But then once in this context, it seemed very obvious I should ask that. And so I dug. I could definitely see it going off the rails.
00:16:05
And I'll also add one thing about my mom, which is I one time told a story on a talk show that was kind of embarrassed her and she called me and she was a little embarrassed and I felt really bad and and I said, I'm sorry. I guess I sometimes just assume you're as open as I am or whatever it is.
00:16:25
And then she called me back about a week and a half later and she said, you know what, I was wrong to call you. This is your story. And you you have a full right to tell your story. And it involves me sometimes. And that can be sometimes I'm embarrassed by that. But you certainly if you have any right to tell your own story. So I already had that relationship. So I think that puts me in a much better spot than maybe I don't know what your relationship is with your parents.
00:16:50
Are they still married?
00:16:52
They're still married. My parents are still together.
00:16:55
And I mean, there's there are a million directions we could go with that, but maybe we do. Maybe another time.
00:17:03
But before we before we turn it into the Tim Tim therapy session, which we can.
00:17:08
Well, we will when you're on my show for sure. Yeah, we'll do that. I'm very curious if.
00:17:15
Eh, that's a level of, like equanimity that you've seen in your mom before, because that's a very. I want to see maturer not in the age related sense, but in the sort of psychological sense perspective to take with your story and the divulging and telling of things that might be embarrassing to her might even cause uncomfortable conversations with her friends.
00:17:39
Have you seen that before?
00:17:40
And then the second part is, did you see any downside or did she experience any downside to being on the show? As someone who is not a public figure and as we both know, a lot of weirdos can come out of the woodwork.
00:17:52
Oh, yeah. Although it is filtered at a certain point, as I'm sure you experience. Like in general, if someone's listening to your show, they probably like you. You know, I doubt people hate listen to you the way they did to Howard Stern in the night on my show that my my stuff is too long.
00:18:10
I do do it.
00:18:15
No, she she has had nothing but incredibly positive moving reactions to that, and I do think she thought maybe what I have thought in the past, which is what she says is this is going to be embarrassing to her brother's or her other family members.
00:18:31
Right. And that was not the case, and I guess that's what I've kind of learned almost two hundred and fifty times in a row doing the show, which is like every time you think it's going to be embarrassing and there's going to be backlash, that's almost assuredly going to mean something real and vulnerable came out. And I've just seen I've yet to see vulnerability met with shittiness thus far. I mean, it'll certainly happen. And and certainly some some things I've admitted have been mildly weaponized by by different political points of view.
00:19:06
But in general, I've just been so encouraged and a little bit the premise of why I want to do the show is that I'm in a 12 step program, I'm in AA. I watch people, I've watched people for the last 17 years share things that should make you hate them. But they're when they do it and they're owning it as a fault or a mistake or a character defect, it's just hard not to be empathetic towards that because, man, I've yet to meet the person who's not wrestling with some shittiness.
00:19:35
You know, I think it's pretty it's a unifying trait of us humans.
00:19:41
We've got some shit we're all dealing with, it seems like. You have earned and use extremely well vulnerability as a superpower of sorts on your show and quite possibly elsewhere in your life. Let's talk about one component of that, which is addiction.
00:20:05
When did you first? Think of yourself as having a problem with any type of of substance abuse or substance use.
00:20:17
Throughout my using, but I had a different point of view, which is my heroes at that time were Bukowski. They were other romantic drunks, they were Waylon Jennings. And I had this this fantasy, this romantic fantasy that I could do something artistically that would be impactful enough that it would excuse all of my shittiness. Right. So, like Whalen's got several songs basically apologizing for cheating on his wife. And it's hard to be in love with a fun loving man.
00:20:48
And Bukowski would put these books out and it kind of excuse what a horrendous piece of shit he was in his real life. So I think I very much was I was looking to be a fuck up, but but maybe one that was funny enough that people overlooked it or I wrote something important enough that people would give me a pass. And so that was kind of my my fantasy. And on some level, it worked a bit. I think people were willing to be around me more than some other people that are less funny, but.
00:21:18
I had underestimated that I ultimately suffered I ultimately was demoralized and pessimistic and defeated in that it really wasn't about all the people around me I could keep in my orbit.
00:21:37
That I ultimately had to be with myself all the time and and so I had an awareness that I drank too much that was quite obvious. And I knew that I used cocaine far more frequently than the surgeon general would recommend.
00:21:51
And I I didn't care until, you know, I had a few attempts at getting sober and I could put together two or three months. I generally did it because I knew I couldn't use the way I used and work in movies and I cared more about that. So I would generally get sober for movies. And then in between movies, I would I would go out. But I had my most profound moment was I was about to start this movie, Zathura.
00:22:17
I knew I had to get sober for I thought, oh, I'm going to go to Hawaii for a week vacation with a buddy before I start saying, no, I'm going to be getting sober. And I specifically went to Hawaii because I was under the impression they didn't have cocaine. There is very hard to get cocaine there.
00:22:30
And I didn't want to die. But they have other stuff there. And I found crystal meth and all this stuff. And by the time I left that trip, I had a layover in San Francisco and I was so physically sick from that week. I had been in a car accident. I had smoked meth for a few days.
00:22:48
I was just I was so much physical anguish that when I got to San Francisco, I really needed to get down like three or four jack and diets to make the flight to L.A. And I had been in L.A. at that point.
00:23:02
So I'm so afraid someone from AA is going to run into me at this airport. And so I'm hiding in the corner of this bar and there's the proverbial mirror. It actually was there. And I'm I'm hiding and I am people recognized me. So that dream had come true. I was about to make the most amount of money I ever made in my life starting that movie, an amount of money that I thought would solve all things. And I was the most scared, most depressed, most suicidal I had ever been with all the things I had wanted to get.
00:23:40
And that was a very, very scary moment.
00:23:42
And I realized, wow, it really isn't about those things. I had told myself, as I think a lot of people do, like if I got some money, I'd be happy. If I got this girl, I'd be happy if I got this job, I'd be happy. And I was lucky enough to get all those things. And I was very unhappy. And so I really had to ask why and I had to actually figure out how to be happy because it wasn't those things.
00:24:07
They help for sure. I don't want them to be taken away. But but I was at my shittiest point with all the things I had set out to get. Where did you land asking those questions in terms of what makes you happy? What were the levers that mattered? What were the ingredients that mattered?
00:24:24
Well, I've slowly cobbled together a little checklist for me. I think it's a shame I just had a decade of Shame's all kinds of deplorable behaviors while fucked up. So that was a big component and then really self-esteem. Right. I was trying to get my value from a lot of outside validation and then I got it and I just I saw the same person in the mirror. I also dated girls that I was convinced if that girl liked me, well, clearly that would prove I was desirable and worthy of wanting.
00:25:01
And then every time I look in the mirror at their house, I same piece of shit.
00:25:05
And so over years of being sober, my list really became, have I exercised? I can't put too fine a point on my belief in exercise I like I'm a zealot about it. I am annoying.
00:25:21
I if I had to pick one thing in my life, it would be that I exercise. I've just never felt worse after an hour of exercise than I felt before. So exercise is huge. You know, have I gone to a meeting that's huge. Have I been of service to somebody I don't want to be? And in general, when I feel terrible, if I ask myself those three things of those three things happened today, they've never happened.
00:25:45
I've never done those three things and been in major discontent. You know, that for me is kind of my checklist.
00:25:54
You mentioned shame. It's a shame. And it's something I've danced with at points, certainly after some certainly after some childhood experiences.
00:26:03
And I know you've you've had your own rounds with various types of shame and so on. I wasn't planning on going here this early in the conversation, but you recently admitted to a relapse and had a very public conversation about it. If we flashback to your mom's experience, not wanting to fail. Well, not wanting to admit that this time it hadn't worked.
00:26:33
Yeah, I view what you did is is tremendously that is coming out and addressing it and. Putting in place something proactively as a plan to try to mitigate it happening again. Walk me through your experience of deciding to tell, deciding to share, because as you know, psychologically, I can't speak to what that was like internally, but I'd like to hear it.
00:26:59
Yeah, I was very, very hesitant to share it, certainly publicly.
00:27:08
One, I had let this 16 years of sobriety become so intertwined with my identity, I mean, I would tell someone within the first half hour meeting them that I have been sober for 16 years. So it was like so much of my identity was that. No. And, you know, we fight to protect our identity pretty hard. And I did as well. And then additionally, I had this ego component, which is. I so cherished the people who listen to the show, who would hear my story of of sobriety and recovery and then maybe try going to a meeting or they or they got sober.
00:27:53
I mean, I've gotten, you know, hundreds and hundreds of messages from people over the last few years of doing the podcast saying, hey, man, I'm two months sober because you thanks for this thing. And I, I have of it was just genuinely I think that's in esteemable acts.
00:28:08
So that gave me a ton of self-esteem and and then my ego's certainly some percentage of that, which is maybe the unhealthy part of it, which is I liked being a beacon of someone that this program worked for. And I didn't want to lose that, I didn't want to not be someone people would look up to and want sobriety from, and as I started telling people closest to me that I had relapsed, a good friend of mine said, you know, if if you're true in that your real desire is to help people, it's so much more helpful that you relapsed like it is you have in 16 years.
00:28:50
And being married to Kristen Bell is not very helpful to anyone.
00:28:54
Those aren't overnight goals that someone would feel like they could relate to you on. He said so if if you're if you're honest and true about this desire to help people, this is very helpful. And so I.
00:29:08
I really took that advice to heart, and I also, as you know, the level of there's something much different for me about listeners and what I call armed Cherrie's than people maybe who saw me in Idiocracy, right. In Idiocracy. You've got Mike. Judge is the genius behind that. And it's his vision that we're all executing. And if you like the show, you probably like me, like I'm very connected to anyone that likes the show. I think they like me, not a character.
00:29:39
I played so and I couldn't have a show begging people to be honest about the shitty things that they've done and then not do that in return.
00:29:49
But it was really, really hard. And then I had other fears. Again, this is all in the myths of being a. Actively addicted to opiates, so a lot of the things I would tell you I know now are not the truth at all, but in those moments I'm like, you know, I come out and say, I relapse. I may lose sponsors. I don't know. I may not get asked to sell Samsung microwaves. You know, I make a living.
00:30:14
There's a financial component that could backfire. And I'll add into it. It's so not fair for my wife that now every fucking interview she does for the next six months, they're going to ask her about my relapse like that. That feels very unfair to me that I would put her in this situation where now she's got to explain what the hell happened.
00:30:39
So those are just all the factors that were I was afraid to come clean about. And then it was an interesting experience doing it, because when we were Monica and I recorded it, I had a lot of control over that. I could we could edit something out. If we didn't like it, we could not release it. We still had control. And then there was a period where we're like, well, what do we call it? So I had control over what it was called, the way to control over what day it came out.
00:31:07
And then I underestimated that. Once it was out, it was just out. And then I had no control over it.
00:31:12
And one of the reasons I relapse is I fucking love control. I love to know what mood I will be in. I love to regulate my emotions and my feelings.
00:31:23
And I that's one thing drugs do is, you know, how you will feel in thirty minutes. And I desire that. And so but I will say all my fears that they've yet to come to pass. Now, I didn't lose any sponsors. I had this.
00:31:40
We have this great relationship, light life, which is an alternative. You know, it's vegetarian meat, right. I got up a huge basket of flowers from them. It said, like, we want more than anything to still be in business with you. So it couldn't have been nicer. It was, you know, humiliating in some ways. And then ultimately, the bottom line is. I felt horrendous lying to the people in my life, I had not gassed people in 16 years and I was gaslighting people.
00:32:12
I was gaslighting letting people in my life. I was gaslighting a doctor. I was I was doing it. And I just I don't have the stomach for it anymore. I couldn't do it. It was like I would look at Monika's like you're on something. And then I deny, deny, deny and make her feel crazy. And then I feel horrendous about that.
00:32:31
They used to not bother me or I used to be able to do it, but I just I wasn't able to do it. And so whatever downside that there was, which was so minimal, the relief of not looking at people I love and fucking lying to their faces is been, you know, infinitely better. Just a quick thanks to one of our sponsors, and we'll be right back to the show.

00:34:31
So your wife has said publicly that you're also addicted to self-improvement or or growth, and that seems to be in your favor.
00:34:41
What are some of the for those people listening who perhaps have battled with addiction or relapsing, what are some of the things you're putting in place to decrease the likelihood of it happening again? What have you changed? It's a really interesting experience for me because I'm more Dave thirty five or something right now, right? So. The first couple of weeks was just kind of really owning that it wasn't just this last period where I had had two back to back surgeries.
00:35:14
I mean, that certainly lit a fire under it. But if I really go back, it started, as I said in that episode, with having been in a motorcycle accident, having a legit prescription, leaving it in Detroit because I had no one to administer it, going home to take care of my dad who's dying of cancer. He has Percocet. I take Percocet with my dad. So that's that's shady. That's I'm not really supposed to do that, but I'm justifying that is well, I have a prescription at home and fuck it also.
00:35:44
My dad's dying and we're sitting here looking at the lake and I can kind of justify that. And then I admit it to Kristen and Kristen doesn't think I'm a terrible piece of shit over that. And I kind of just work through that. Right. And then that becomes a little bit of a misleading experience, which is like, oh, yeah, I did that once and it was no big deal. I didn't go out and buy more. I didn't do anything crazy.
00:36:03
I didn't act like an addict. Opiates were never my thing. And then I get, you know, I've a lot of stupid hobbies and I get hurt.
00:36:11
Maybe two years later I get hurt again and I have a prescription.
00:36:15
And now. This time, I don't take them at night when they're administered to me because they they fuck up my sleep, so I just save them.
00:36:23
And then in the morning, when I get the other administered ones, I now take two because that feels better than the one. So now we're getting more shady.
00:36:30
But again, I'm not not shady enough where I'm ready to go like, oh, I don't have 12 years of sobriety over this.
00:36:36
And it's I willfully. Allow myself to be misled by all that I go, this isn't something that I really don't have control over. I know what powerlessness feels like. I know what unmanageability feels like. If I drink, there's no guessing where I'll be in three days. And if we had Coke to that, there's just no guessing where I'll be for a week or so. You know, that to me is powerlessness and unmanageability. But this thing is very misleading because I can do my job, I can wake up on time, I can be there with my kids.
00:37:10
I can do everything I would do. And for the most part, no one has any idea. And I'm doing all the things I think I'm supposed I need to do. I'm exercising. I'm still doing the fucking checklists, which is ridiculous. And being of service, I'm exercising and I'm going to meetings. But again, now the lies are just they're just piling up.
00:37:31
They, you know, a little in the morning has to I need three more by like three to make the first one make sense. And I'm like, oh my God, I forgot how this spirals. And then that that was became very clear that that it was unmanageable. I cut it like I don't know who I was telling what to at some point. And then the powerlessness was just, you know, opiates is a gnarly thing to get addicted to because daily your tolerance goes up.
00:37:55
So even if you're not even in search of getting higher, you're just going to have to take more and more and more. And and that's that's the situation I find myself in pretty quickly into the whole thing, which is like I'm taking a tremendous amount now and I'm going to have a horrendous detox and I know it. And that was not part of the plan that I answer your question.
00:38:17
You didn't, but the backstory is helpful. What are you doing now or work some? Some. I'm sorry I told you the first. Yes. Yeah. So the first part was that you put in place. Yes. So the first part was just understanding how this thing happened. I needed to get my arms around, like, how did it happen, what happened with all these baby steps?
00:38:36
So that was important for me to acknowledge.
00:38:38
Like, there's no wiggle for me, you know, there's no white lie for me because the white lie, it'll just it'll grow.
00:38:46
That's what it does. It grows. And then secondly, I had to ask myself, what am I trying to escape? You know, what do I find so uncomfortable in my life that I need to confront? And that took a couple weeks for me to kind of isolate and that's being tackled now. That's being tackled in therapy and that's been addressed. And I, I know and I'm not really ready to let everyone in the world know what that is for me, but.
00:39:23
Funny enough, the most generic thing in the book and a big book is Resentment's will make us drink.
00:39:30
We can't have them for whatever reason. We're the type of people that just we can't afford to have them. And and I had a couple and they were huge and I was ignoring them and I was not wanting to confront them. And and I'm now, you know, in the process of working through all those. So I think age is coming clean, being honest with everybody, and then committing to figuring out why I wanted to escape and addressing that, which I feel like is happening.
00:40:04
And then again, the huge silver lining of this whole story is that I didn't go drink and do coke, which I didn't think was possible. I thought if I had to add one day, I'd be like, fuck it. Well, then I want a drink. I miss that. So I just feel crazy. Lucky that that compulsion didn't come over me.
00:40:21
Also, as you're talking about remaining honest to your listeners, it strikes me that if the only thing that came out of your podcast were the strength of that public accountability with this type of situation, that that would be a huge Arawa high on starting the podcast.
00:40:39
Right. I mean, that's that's that's an incredible point of leverage.
00:40:44
You mentioned Monica's name a few times. For those who don't know who Monica is, who is Monica?
00:40:49
She is my co-host on armchair expert. And her story's fantastic, which is she was in our friendship circle kind of peripherally, and she let us know she could babysit. So I think about seven years ago, maybe she babysat for our firstborn kid a little bit. And then we had a second kid. We kind of brought her on more full time to help. And then we discovered pretty quickly that she was also a UCB person and was incredibly funny and a really good writer.
00:41:19
So then Kristen started asking her to write things for her and then she kind of just took over Kristen's life. She if Kristen hosted an award show, Monica writes it, if Kristen does a commercial, she punches it up like she just became funny enough in some of the ways. Some of the stuff I used to do for Kristen, now Monica did. And which so I was just very thrilled about that was like, oh, good.
00:41:41
We have two writers in the house now, so and then. So she transitioned from watching the kids to really running Kristen's whole thing. And then she was always around in our hobby would be to argue about the political things or podcast we had just heard or a TV show we loved debating. And so when we when I wanted to do a podcast, I thought, oh, this would be so great to have her both just to be a completely different point of view than my own.
00:42:10
And I think is also important that it's it's it would be a non-white in a non male point of view would be helpful. And and she has provided that and become, you know, the most beloved part of the show. And she also fact checks all my interviews because I spout facts I learned in college in nineteen ninety nine that are either not true anymore or I've misremembered them.
00:42:32
So she has this fact check component and it's kind of morphed.
00:42:37
And then she had her own show on our network that was as big as our show. So she's just she's amazing.
00:42:43
So you poached your wife's chief of staff for you figured we had to have like a it was a really funny conversation because she's like, you know, I think you're stealing Monica, right?
00:42:55
And I was like, yeah, yeah, I go. But, you know, we just we got to go with what's financially better for everyone.
00:43:02
And so had I not had the financial argument, my corner, I don't I wouldn't want to list double click on Monica's roll a little bit.
00:43:11
There's a piece, large piece from the L.A. Times. And there's there's a short mention or an excerpt that I'm going to pull out, which is eventually padman came up with a business plan and together they hashed out rough parameters.
00:43:24
So that refers to the planning stage of the podcast. Could you describe at that point in the very nascent stages? Because you're very thoughtful and you're very smart guy, also very agile on your feet. Very funny, of course, but also very methodical and very analytical, if you want to be.
00:43:44
And Monica, clearly very smart. What did the business plan and parameters look like in the beginning when you guys are on the back of a napkin?
00:43:52
Yeah, that might be overstated. I think that implies a lot more planning than we actually did. But I mean, in a nutshell, two things.
00:44:02
I'm a terrible delegator. I have a ton of. Fear that someone won't execute something in the same tone that I like right again, back to me being a control freak, it's why I went into directing at some point.
00:44:17
And so to find someone like her who I had watched take over Kristen's point of view in town and execute it flawlessly for years.
00:44:27
I just felt very safe, like the first person I think I've ever really just trusted to execute this shared idea. So, yeah, I don't I didn't know anything other than I had been a guest on Podcast's. Right. That's all I knew about podcasts. And so in Rob to our other producer, he's very instrumental in this. He was producing another podcast and I met him on there. And so Monica was like meeting with people who have successful podcasts and finding out everything that goes into it.
00:44:55
So she really did gather up all that. I just wanted to chat and she really figured out how to do it with with Rob, who was also very instrumental in it. And then the thing evolves, right. It becomes something that you weren't necessarily you couldn't have foreseen and you thought you wanted to do one show, but it kind of becomes another show. And and she was just she's incredibly helpful and and being it's just great to have two people who are objective checking each other because I'm wrong a lot.
00:45:26
She's wrong a lot. But together there's like a there's a pilot co-pilot thing. I'll call her the pilot for this. And I'm the co-pilot. But, yeah, she just I'll tell you, we didn't edit when we first started the show. And the result of that was I felt a compulsion to fill every dead seconds of air time. I already talked way too much. I've steamrolled in this interview. And so I did it even times 10 because I was like, well, this person's thinking for twenty two seconds I got to say something.
00:45:57
And Monica was like, we need to start editing the show. And then she started editing the show and she really then becomes the editor. So in charge of the tone of the show, it's just it's her point of view as much as anyone's, because she does do that. And I've never listened to an episode and thought, what the fuck was she thinking? I'm always like, oh, God, thank God. She she also knows when I go too far, which I go too far quite often.
00:46:23
And she saves me just to give people a peek behind the curtain.
00:46:29
How do you, Monica and Rob, split responsibilities just so people have a window into the podcast operation, so to speak?
00:46:37
Because this is certainly me following my own curiosity. I mean, you've you've built something amazing, you and your team. How do they split responsibilities?
00:46:45
OK, so I'll kind of tell you prie covid, because it's evolved, obviously, for for covid it's changed dramatically. But when we did every interview in person, Rob was in charge of every audio thing we needed, every, you know, the hosting site publishing it. He takes the photographs. He's really great at graphic design. So he does, ah, look, the yellow thing. And he also does all the merchandising like we he designs all the stuff.
00:47:14
I mean, Monica and I are involved in it, but he physically makes everything, I assume on Photoshop or some.
00:47:20
I don't even know what he uses. He is also the liaison between all the technical people that are involved in it. And then Monica is very much a producer in that she's dealing with publicists. She's booking the show quite often. She is on the calls with sponsors and advertisers trying to explain what we do and what we don't do and how everyone can be happy. So she's like, by the time it gets to me and it's time for me to read ads, all the things have been handled by Monica, right.
00:47:54
Whether that's just like, oh, we don't actually say that. But he's happy to do this, you know. So she's in charge of both, you know, editing, dealing with all the advertisers, booking and dealing with getting people. Rob also will get people to like it's a lot easier for us to get experts than it is celebrities. And our show is Monday, celebrity Thursday expert. So experts generally have a book to sell and that makes it a lot easier.
00:48:23
So but but Monica is now very dialed in with all these different publicists. And as we've had better guests than more people are interested in all this. And she's she handles all that I research. I show up and I interview people and I also reach out to people that maybe I have access to that no one else has access to. And on rare occasion, Kristen has to get involved because people like her a lot more than me.
00:48:46
So the podcast landscape is kind of an elephant graveyard of three episode podcasts or 10 episode podcasts.
00:48:55
Even very well-known people with ostensibly pre-existing audiences just tap out frequently. Yeah, and there are God knows how many what, thirty thousand fifty thousand one hundred thousand new podcasts a week launching. I have no idea. The number is enormous.
00:49:10
Yeah. And you kind of pull vaulted very quickly to a dominant position and you have stayed there.
00:49:19
And this is probably a question you're tired of people asking you, but to what would you attribute that if you had to speculate or your best friends or people who know the show really well? If it's easier to answer that way, what do they attribute it to?
00:49:34
Well, we launched really big, right. Which was an advantage that we have over so many people. And we and we launched very big or at least I explained it by the fact that Chris and I did it together and the episode didn't go that well, which I think people found very I know probably like mirror neurons satisfying anyone who is in a relationship, you know.
00:50:02
So I had an explanation for why the first episode did really well. And then also some of my my more popular friends like Kemel, I think was on the first batch and so is Ashton. They were nice enough to help.
00:50:13
So when they were a part of the launch, I really kind of attributed it to them and or the shared interest in Kristen and I as a couple because we found this out, it would be hard to miss if, say, she posted a picture of herself. Let's say it gets you know, I don't know what one hundred thousand likes. She pose a picture of her and I together it'll get like three hundred thousand likes. And same for me.
00:50:37
There's like a factor of three things, you know, more than the sum of our parts. So I had to explain it by that. And I thought for sure it would all fall off soon as she was not on the show and my other huge friends were not on the show.
00:50:51
And then it just kept working and I didn't know why. I don't know that I fully know why. I think there's a tremendous amount of luck involved. And and also we get incredible guests. I mean, the guests thing is it's own machine, where once Bill Gates is on someone else who maybe was like, I don't know, you know, it just it all some of it becomes self-perpetuating. But I'll say and when we talked on the phone, I told you this, that I learned a lot when we started doing live shows and we got to.
00:51:23
Actually interact with people who listen to the show and we'd hear their questions, and as I told you then, I always noticed in Sam Harris is live shows, when people ask questions, it's just a it's a diatribe thesis on some kind of molecular biology. Like the real goal is clearly I want them to think I'm smart. And so what I glean from that is that they like that Sam Smart. That's what they like about the show. That's what I like about the show.
00:51:47
I like that he can argue well with other people and I'm exposed to really smart people.
00:51:51
So when we started taking questions, they were all they were almost unanimously, oh my God, I'm sorry. I'm wearing the sweat suit. I wore a skirt, but my thighs were sweating too much because I'm on my period and I had to go to Ross and buy the stupid sweat suit for five dollars. Anyways, I was wondering what your shower routine is. Right. And then the next person I get up like I find it in the thing and now my friend won't sit with me.
00:52:11
And I was just like I was overwhelmed with how vulnerable all these people were. It's like they led first with something kind of embarrassing or vulnerable about themselves. And it wasn't until then where I was like, well, then that must be what they like about me. And that must be what they like about the guests when they're on our show versus other shows is that they seem to be more vulnerable or something. And so I guess that's it. And then I guess from that I would conclude it must be rare.
00:52:40
It must be rare to hear people be that way, or people would be listening, especially with the mixture of guests that you have on the show, if that makes any sense.
00:52:53
I mean, I think that vulnerability from real vulnerability not rehearsed.
00:52:59
One or two story vulnerability, but like true, I haven't talked about this before, vulnerability at real time. Yeah, real time. Oh shit.
00:53:07
I think I just backed into a corner vulnerability from both the Tier one celebrity and tier one experts is is quite uncommon.
00:53:16
So I think, well, they have a safety net, I'll add, you know, so everyone that comes on the show, we tell them upfront you can cut anything out you want when you go home tonight. You know, like I should have told that story about my brother. His feelings will be hurt. They just tell us that we cut it out. So we're not 60 Minutes or The New York Times. Like, I have no journalistic obligation to not give people the right to cut shit out.
00:53:39
Right.
00:53:40
So I think I think what happens is they know that if they say something regrettable, they can just get rid of it. And then upon saying it, I think they realize they feel different than they feared they would feel or they see from our reaction that we relate and then they're maybe not afraid anymore that that that came out in that time. It's like I know you just published something really intimate, but it's like I've been blessed when I tell people I've been blessed, I can just see in them.
00:54:07
They're like, oh, wow, he just said that. And no one ran away. OK, fuck, I'm going to say it too. Yeah, I was. I mean, look. Twenty five percent at least if a body keeps a score is an accurate book. Twenty five percent of people have had some sexual trauma in their childhood. I mean, so any time you with four people, one person there, it's not rare. 40 percent of kids have experienced physical abuse enough that it left a mark.
00:54:32
I mean, these are not rare occurrences yet.
00:54:34
We all feel so isolated in them and and unique and at fault somehow.
00:54:42
So, yeah, I just think there's something about if you start, people are inclined to match you, you know.
00:54:50
You know, when we were chatting on the phone, I was asking you how you prepare for episodes. And it seemed to me and tell me if I'm misremembering this, but just for people out there who who might feel like they're just a collection of weaknesses, that one of your, let's say, past challenges.
00:55:10
Dyslexia is actually a superpower of sorts when it comes to podcast prep because you have such a developed memory.
00:55:18
That you don't need to rely overly so on lots and lots and lots of notes, which is part of the reason why I tend not to do video, because I like to look at a lot of notes. I don't have that retention that you seem to have. Is that a fair description?
00:55:32
Yeah, I think what other dyslexics who I've met throughout the years, what we seem to share in common. Let me back up and say there's a great chapter in a Malcolm Gladwell book I want to say in the Goliath book about four years.
00:55:49
And this is what I learned growing up, that dyslexics or twice as likely to end up in prison, which makes total sense because you're going to fail out of school and what are your options.
00:55:59
But it's since been revealed that also this number is not right. So whatever the number is. You're also twice as likely to become a CEO, so it's like, oh, that's that's kind of interesting. It's like it can break you, but also it can become this asset. And so what I found from a lot of other dyslexics is that says you're not really getting anything off that chalkboard. That is just that's a roadblock. You're kind of forced to really develop a great aural memory.
00:56:26
So, like, when people tell me a story, I find that I just remember that, you know, I'll run into people that I haven't seen in five years and I'll be like, oh, my God, didn't you? And I may remember the story better than they do. And so when I. Yeah, research and I kind of I think out my thoughts and I as I'm learning about them, questions pop up and I kind of jot them down on paper.
00:56:48
But once just the act of me writing them, they're pretty much in there then. So yeah, that must be a result of that dyslexia background where I can, you know, hold on to that. Although it's getting worse. I'll add that, you know, I have two kids and I'm getting older.
00:57:06
I was on opiates for a few months, chipping, chipping away at the prefrontal cortex. Yeah.
00:57:13
You give your guests final cut that. That's also something I do. I'm actually, frankly, surprised that more shows don't make that explicit. It's kind of shocking to me.
00:57:24
I ended up modeling that on Inside the Actor's Studio because early on, early on, I had hired I was introduced to someone who used to do research for Inside the Actor's Studio.
00:57:37
And I hired them to review transcripts of some of the early episodes of my show to try to identify where I was sloppy, where I could improve, etc., which was a really useful exercise.
00:57:48
And so the question for you is, how have you?
00:57:52
Thought about working on interviewing or how have you most improved as an interviewer since starting the show?
00:58:01
I'm still really bad at this. I still give myself a C, but I used to be an E is I guess I talk way too much.
00:58:10
It's just it's as if I met you at a bar and I want your approval and I'm aware of that and I'm trying to get your approval.
00:58:15
And so I've I've talked to less and less and less over the last few years. And it gets better, better the less I talk. But again, I am and I will justify it a little bit in that I am so often trying to enact vulnerability, which requires me to go first. It's almost like an AA meeting where it's like I share first and then maybe you're compelled to share back. And so it's kind of required.
00:58:41
And then we get into this tricky situation where I mean, it's tricky for Monica is like, how many fucking times can they hear me tell the story? Right. They got to be so bored of it.
00:58:52
But at the same time, the guest I have doesn't listen to the show, so they've not heard it.
00:58:57
And then I also feel like it's mildly unethical to cut out the part where I say I was molested and then just cut right to them, going like, yeah, I was not, you know. So it's a little it's a little dicey. It's not perfected by any stretch. And I do end up talking more than probably people would prefer. But yeah, I've got more and more comfortable with it. I think also I originally when I started interviewing experts, I am intimidated by them.
00:59:23
I mean, I'm talking to Richard Dawkins like I read Selfish Gene and just thought, how could someone have thought of that, you know? Twenty years of thinking, this guy is brilliant.
00:59:32
So my own fragile ego wants him to know I get your book. So I'm going to waste so much of this interview letting you know I get your book and I just more and more I'm I don't try to prove to the person I'm smart, which is very hard. Again, with the dyslexia baggage, I have a chip on my shoulder that everyone thinks I'm dumb. No matter how much proof I get to the contrary, I still have to work through that fear.
01:00:00
So if you used to give yourself an E and now you give yourself see, aside from and your words, not mine talking too much, what is improved and what do you most want to improve? Or is it just the volume of talking?
01:00:14
Is are there other aspects?
01:00:16
You know, one thing I'll say that has evolved as I was trying too hard at the beginning to get people to be sharing something we never heard in that again, I wanted it to be like, and here's what happens. I'm always in a meeting with other dudes and I hear some person share. And I think, God, I'm so lucky to hear men talk about this. I don't think anyone not in AA gets to experience this. And so I want everyone to have that.
01:00:43
And so then the people I have on I, I want to with them having no AA experience, I want them to jump right into that. And so I think I pushed pretty hard at the beginning and and I've laid off and then sometimes I think, have I laid off too much like there's some things, but I am getting more confident with just when it's going to be that type interview. That's great. It'll be that type of interview. They'll they'll I follow them more.
01:01:11
I try really hard now to follow more than I previously tried to lead because they just get repetitive. You know, I have all these insecurities. I think we relate a little bit on this, just like there was a while there where I was just looking at how many listeners we have and I'm just waiting for it to drop. I'm like, well, this is going to drop. I know the inevitable trajectory of all things. They even hit TV shows.
01:01:32
They just slowly and precipitously lose. And there's better shows out there. And then I get this, you know, all these things.
01:01:40
And I just had to stop thinking about that. I just had to remember. No, no, I did this with no expectations. I didn't think a lot of people would listen. I just love talking. Just fucking enjoy talking. And then things will happen one way or another. And so I pretty much I've.
01:01:55
Semi successfully gotten out of the I haven't asked Rob what the numbers are and probably a year. No. Well, maybe the first month of covert, I was like, curious what that had done. But but since then, I haven't asked. And that's kind of a good barometer for me of how healthy I am and and how much I'm getting my esteem from the right place. I now just think that I love talking to that person or not.
01:02:15
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe in doing prep for this that I read somewhere that it was confusing to you in a sense to see the podcast achieve escape velocity and become this juggernaut while not working on it as hard as you had in other things that had produced less stellar results.
01:02:39
And Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, my question is, do you think that is just something inherent to the format or is there is there some aspect of you hitting your zone of genius and flow because precisely because you are not trying extremely hard.
01:02:58
I mean, that could certainly be it. I think there's other factors, too. Yeah, the thing I kind of the example I gave was that I'm used to directing a movie where it's a two year endeavor, like Chipps for me was at least two and a half years of my life, or that's all I did. And then it's the whole outcomes decided on a Friday by three p.m.. I know if I've completely wasted two and a half years of my life in that respect.
01:03:22
I mean, I enjoyed the process so much, but in that respect, yeah, not the outcome I wanted at all.
01:03:29
And that that's happened to me twice on two different movies where I just I gave it two years of my life and then it just it floundered.
01:03:36
So you had to show up and do something for three hours for it to work. Felt very like something's too good to be true here.
01:03:44
I think I had a lot of that going like this isn't how it works. I'm supposed to sit in here, make up for an hour, which I don't want to do. Then I got to learn a bunch of lines and then I got to tediously shoot this scene and all these things. And this is like, no, sit down, shoot the shit and bail. And it works. It's just very confusing.
01:04:03
It's hard to understand why it would work. But yeah, I think some of it is like I didn't even know what expectations to have. I didn't know enough about podcasting to know if I was a failure or as I can tell you, what a successful comedy movie is that you spent twenty five million on. I know you have to hit thirteen five that opening weekend for you, but I didn't really know that, so I wasn't even thinking about it.
01:04:26
It's probably the thing in my life that has been purist in that it was really just about the experience and not about the results. And then lo and behold, I ended up with good results when I didn't care, which is so confusing. I try to tell this to like I have no advice for actors, but one is just you got to somehow convince yourself you don't care if you get cast in this thing. That's the only way you'll be good in the audition.
01:04:49
So you got to somehow trick yourself. I don't know how you're going to do it, but I found a method for me to do it. And yeah, that's kind of seems to be the case here. What is your method to for yourself?
01:05:03
Yes, well, a couple of things, I've been lucky enough that I've cast things now, and I do know now that so often it's not about how good or bad you is, that people are right or wrong for stuff. You know, someone could have been much better at it in theory, but they they're just not right. They don't there's something I don't know what it is. So recognizing it's not personal helped from being on the other side of it and then also tricking myself into if if I love acting, if that's my what I'm claiming I am as someone who loves to act and all this is just an opportunity to go act.
01:05:36
So I just I get to go act in. That's something, I suppose, the love. So if I don't love going and acting in front of people, then I'm probably doing the wrong thing. So to see the audition itself isn't is an end in itself. Like I get to go act. And then I also have this point of view now, which is like I'm going to show you what I would love to do in this movie or TV show.
01:05:58
And you may or may not like that, and that may or may not be right for this TV show, and that'll be OK because I really only want to do this thing. And so getting ownership over it, it's like I'd like to go be in your movie and act like this. And that may or may not work for you. I won't take it personally, as I hope you won't take it personally that I don't want to go and shove a banana peel up my ass to get a laugh.
01:06:21
That's just not what I want to do. So maybe neither of us want to do with each other wants do. But occasionally those things are going to overlap beautifully in the more I've just been able to go. I'm excited to go show them this interpretation I have of this writing, and that'll be that. It's just the outcomes gotten a lot better once I switched into that mindset. I think that goes for a job interview, too, by the way.
01:06:45
I think if you go there, show them who you actually are, you're better off being at the job. Where you being actually you is wanted than you trying to be fucking Eddie Haskell. And everyone finds out eight months later, oh, guess what? This guy does not like doing research on the weekends. That's not his bag you have.
01:07:08
This incredible podcast with just as a lot of podcast, I mean, I speak for my podcast, I mean, an incredible Arawa, like you said, it's not two and a half years in. And then you find out on a Friday whether it succeeded or failed. I mean, it's three hours in.
01:07:24
And yet more more likely than not, once you have a loyal audience, it's going to succeed on some level. Yeah. Has that changed what you say?
01:07:33
Yes and no to. And how do you decide which projects or invitations to say yes to now? How has it changed, if at all?
01:07:42
It's it's given me this insane freedom because I also grew up quite broke for a period of time and my family was very obsessed with climbing the financial ladder. So I'm obsessed with money and I have great fear and financial insecurity. Irrational, completely irrational. I've had numbers throughout my whole life. I had this amount of no, I'd feel safe. I had this amount of money, I'd feel safe, and then I never felt safe. So I just want to own that.
01:08:11
It's a complete fear. But having a source of income that has nothing to do with movies or television or commercials is so liberating for me, because now really I only. I'm lucky enough to only do stuff that I am excited to do. I don't actually have to think about the financial component. I wouldn't do something motivated out of financial insecurity, which is very new for me, for it's three years old. I always I would always be tempted to take a movie I like to less if the payday was twice as much.
01:08:48
And I've interviewed a couple of people that grew up with wealth and I've watched them navigate their career and I've been envious of it. Nick Kroll comes to mind. He has so much creative integrity. He just does what fascinates him. I think he's had opportunities to do bigger things or bigger paydays, and he's just always stayed on his path of what makes what entertains him. And I just envy that. And, you know, he grew up with a ton of money.
01:09:17
He's he said when I interviewed his fucking dad, drove a school limousine like Mr. Drummond, you know, so I am experiencing that to a degree which is like I really I just get to do things I'm really excited about today in that could totally change. The podcast could go away. You know, I could be back. But currently, yeah, I get to do things I'm super interested in. All right. All right. Don't do him.
01:09:40
We all have fears. I have fears. You have fears that you've you've certainly spoken about very publicly. If we look at the podcast, your podcast, and my understanding is it's skews female in terms of listenership, you have clearly struck a chord with the leading with vulnerability.
01:10:01
Do you ever fear straying outside of that or operating too far outside of a template that that appeals to your core listenership, or does that not cross your mind?
01:10:14
Well, no, it totally does. I'm I'm trying to be as smart about this thing as I can. I I don't want to lose it. And B, I would like to grow it. And so we're in this great situation where you and I have a laboratory and we can try things for very little investment. Right. I can I can try. I'll tell you an example that just happened as I got interested in conspiracy theories as a result of having Bill Gates on and seen all these crazy comments, I really had no idea what the hell they meant.
01:10:45
Save the Children. He's a pedophile. What is going on? Right. So that kind of I got really fascinated with conspiracy theories. So I said to Rob, hey, find us a conspiracy theory expert. And he found this guy, David Ferrara. I can't pronounce his last name. I can spell it for you. But he directed this this documentary Tickled that I loved.
01:11:05
And he also has a show on Netflix called Dark Tourist and I and he is a journalist who investigates conspiracy. So I'm talking to him and I'm having the most amount of fun I've had interviewing somebody in two years, like it's just candy. And so I'm loving it.
01:11:24
And then we can kind of see from the results of that episode that people also loved it. And I'm like, well, fuck, I'd love to talk to that guy once a month. And so I call him like, do you want to do this once a month? And like, we'll pay you, like you'll be a part of the show. And he's like, yeah, I'm up for that. And then we saw the response. So it's like, oh, that's awesome.
01:11:45
That that just kind of presented itself and revealed itself. And so I can't wait to do that. And then we've had a couple of different things like that. Just, oh, it worked for us. And then it appears it worked for the audience. So let's let's do that again. And and yeah, I have the three hundred mile goal of I'd love to do this show four days a week.
01:12:06
I would love to give people what I get from Howard Stern, which is like, oh, I'm following this story, you know, in a dream world, Monday's candy at some super famous person you like and then, you know, Thursdays protein, it's the experts. But maybe Friday is we give you some weird topics. We just learned about that. It gives you something to talk about on the weekend at your barbecue. Like I'd love to, you know, each day, have its own thing and in and not get stagnant and and stay interesting.
01:12:38
And I have some faith that those things will present themselves the way this conspiracy thing did.
01:12:44
So the podcast and I say the podcast, just to be clear, people talking that Dax's podcast is so successful and so reliable and so appealing to so many sponsors.
01:12:58
If you wanted to make the decision tomorrow to do it every day, you could I mean, you could write it sports you enough that you could do that. So why why wait? Why not do that sooner? I'm not saying you should or shouldn't you be curious?
01:13:15
Well, I have a kind of commitment to not do it, just to do it right. So like this David thing is a perfect example, like, oh, I love.
01:13:26
And I want to do it a lot now, and I don't want to just arbitrarily fill up days, I want to make sure that I'm passionate about each day. And I am excited to switch gears from an interview to maybe something more journalistic or whatever it is.
01:13:40
And so I I am committed to that, to making sure that I'm super crazy, passionate about it. And then also I have some some outstanding obligations. I'm on a show, Top Gear, that'll come out in maybe January and I have 12 more. I got a film starting in February and I have a game show my wife and I are going to do. So there's certain things that I'll have to just be mindful of making sure they can fit within a schedule where I'm still I'm doing for a week or something.
01:14:12
But so I guess I see myself maybe not taking any more on air shit or on camera stuff and just doing this all the time because it is my favorite thing to do. Although Top Gear is insane, I just go there and I horse around in fast cars that someone else owns and then I leave and I don't have to deal with anything. I don't have to put new tires on the back of it. And people are excited when I act like a jackass.
01:14:34
And yeah. So that's that would be hard to walk away from as well.
01:14:38
Howard Stern. Yeah, I know you have a lot of respect for Howard Stern. Why do you have so much respect for him and how are you guys different or similar?
01:14:49
Yeah, it's really interesting because I only liked him a bit when he was on terrestrial radio, you know, I wasn't someone who I was never up that early and I didn't commute anywhere. So I had to, like, turn it on in my house, which it was a foreign concept to me. But once he became once he was on satellite radio, I could choose when I listened to him because it just replays and it also evolved enough. I don't think I would have been on board for throwing boloney at girls asses and stuff.
01:15:17
That wasn't really my jam. What I really immediately loved about him is what an amazing interviewer he is.
01:15:24
He's just such a great interviewer and I love that his like I still find this very intriguing about him is that his fan base is, I would guess, opposite of mine. I think it's mostly dudes.
01:15:36
And so here's this guy who has this kind of dude fan base, and there's a lot of sexual stuff, yet he does transcendental meditation. He doesn't really drink. He eats Perfect's. He's in love with his wife and it just monogamous to the core. I love this dichotomy of him. I thought it's interesting that he's speaking to all these guys yet is is seemingly kind of different than his fan base. And I also credit him for doing more for, say, gay rights, something I always cared a lot about.
01:16:09
You know, it doesn't help when I don't know, Lena Dunham gives a speech about gay rights. Her fans already feel that way. They already are in step with her. It's not going to convert anyone. And I always was just applauded, him being so embracing of gay rights when his fan base, I don't think was that way, that I just think that enacted way more progress than the left talking to the left. And I think he's done that kind of bravely with like supporting Hillary and having her on the show.
01:16:41
Those most of his fans don't want to hear Hillary. So I just love that he, like, kept the ear of people open and was very, very soft and gentle with evolving real time himself. He's so much personal evolution. And I think taking his audience along for that ride in a really unique way, I don't think too many people have done that.
01:17:04
When you listen to a stern interview because you mentioned he's an excellent interviewer, I would agree with that for you. What does that mean? What are some of the telltale signs or clues or characteristics where you're like, God damn, that's really good?
01:17:20
Well, the thing that you're almost guaranteed to get in every single stern interview is the person's going to say something they've never said before. Like, if I'm a huge fan of Bill Murray or I'm a huge fan of Letterman, I mean, what could be more fascinating than Stern talking to Letterman? He doesn't talk to anybody.
01:17:39
And the notion that you're going to learn something about them that doesn't exist anywhere else is exciting. I think he has a monopoly on that. And then also his. Passionate interest in people is infectious, and there are many people he's had on that, I think I don't like them going into it. And I got to say, with the exception of maybe three of his guests and I've listened to several hundred interviews, I like the person more after he talks to them.
01:18:10
There's only a few times I was like, oh, a person's kind of a dick. I wasn't expecting that. It generally goes the other way. And and I what I like about that is like I do believe that all these people we disagree with or they are divisive.
01:18:24
I do believe we were stuck somewhere with them and talk to them for two hours, that just the humanity takes over. We're so much more similar than we are different.
01:18:33
And I just find his thing like oddly life affirming and encouraging, like, oh, yeah, I do like that.
01:18:40
Oh, I thought this person was this. Now they're a person who's afraid their kids are going to turn out shitty and that this and that. You know, I like that experience.
01:18:50
Yeah, he's he is incredibly skilled and he can do this, however you put it, throwing bologna chicks asses. He can do that too. Uh huh. He's a he's a connoisseur of that. I remember growing up seeing him on TV and he's like, you know, lesbian's at 2:00 a.m. with Snapple commercials, I was like my memory of never was being twelve years old and having insomnia and watching Howard Stern on television.
01:19:18
But when he wants to turn up the dial on Jedi interviewer, I remember listening to his Sheryl Crow interview and being really impressed with just how well he navigates with so much due diligence and preparation, but not seeming like he's reading off of any type of script.
01:19:38
Extremely skilled. I read related to Howard that.
01:19:44
And I want you to fact check this, but you wouldn't want to invite him on the show because you wouldn't want to feel like you owed him a favor or he was doing it as a favor.
01:19:54
If I'm getting that right, could you expand on that, please?
01:19:57
Yes. I mean, because if Howard Stern came to me and said, I'll be on your show, but you have to, like, be a clown at my kids. But Mitzvah fine because you're a man. You know, I'd be I'd be delighted to owe him a favor. Don't get me wrong. I would want to owe him a favor. But I wanted to add one thing that a gift he has that you and I don't have, which is he is the most skilled.
01:20:19
There's no question also he has a status that you and I don't have that actually has, no matter who he's interviewing, in deep desire of his approval, which is incredible. That's I mean, there going to be a more powerful I think Letterman had that people go up there and they really wanted Dave. I certainly was dying for Dave to like me when I was on the show. It was way more about getting him to like me than whatever was happening with the audience or what movie I was supposed to promote a singular goal.
01:20:47
I want Dave Letterman to like me, and I think he benefits from that a lot. Howard Stern, I know I wanted him to like me when I went on. I don't think when people sit down with you or I, it's like it's going to make or break their year or whether we ultimately like them or not. So I think we have more of an uphill battle. But I just know as a fan of the show and someone who knows him personally, he doesn't want to do anything.
01:21:09
And I get it. I get it. You know, I want to do less and less. And I imagine with more and more success, I'll want to do even less. And so I know he doesn't want to be on this show.
01:21:20
I have faith that if he were on it, he'd enjoy himself and not regret it as much as he thought he was going to.
01:21:26
But I just know he doesn't want to. So I just wouldn't let I have his email. I've never asked him to be on the show. I will never ask him to be on the show. Hopefully, I have said to Baba Booey once, look, he's promoting this book. Our audience fucking buys books, man. That's why we get experts. There's a huge uptick if someone comes on the show with book sales. So I'm not even saying I want a favor.
01:21:50
I'm just saying if you want to sell a lot of books, the door is open. And I just left it at that. But that was as far as I would go with inviting him.
01:21:57
Do you have I know Howard Stern would be a dream guest for a lot of people. He doesn't want to be a dream guest. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have any. Dream guests you have not already reached out to, all right. Is there any one where, like one day?
01:22:15
Well, I got to say, the most shocking event of my life, it's the only guess I've called my mom to brag about that I knew was coming was Bill Gates. I just I saw that documentary on Netflix. I don't know if you. Have you seen that in Sibel's mind?
01:22:30
I haven't. You I guarantee if you give it five minutes, you're going to plow through all four episodes. It's so good. He is one of the most fascinating people to ever live on planet Earth.
01:22:40
There's no question. So I just I'm obsessed with him.
01:22:44
And we didn't invite him on. I just talk about him a lot because I'm obsessed with them. And someone from his team called and said, would you guys want Bill Gates? And Monica called. Better than if she had just hit the lottery is like you are not going to believe she just has to be on the show. And my first thought was like Obama or Bill Gates, like, who would I not believe it was fucking Bill Gates. And I think he was the number one guy I would have wanted to talk to.
01:23:09
But of course, I would love to talk to Obama. I mean, that would be awesome. And then Bill Murray, I just you know, I'm I'm pretty obsessed with Bill Murray. And I I know he doesn't do anything either. So the odds of that happening are very, very slim. But, yeah, I would love to talk to Bill Murray. He's he's a North Star as far as just like like I said, I brought him up at the beginning, like, breathe, believe in yourself.
01:23:37
Be calm. It'll happen.
01:23:39
Perhaps another cliched question, but I'm going to ask because I know people would enjoy hearing the answer, and that is for people who ask you for advice related to podcasting, because you must get it all the time from friends.
01:23:51
Also, I'm thinking of starting the podcast. I just started a podcast. I'm going to start a podcast.
01:23:57
What do you say to people who let's just assume you want to spend a little bit of time and give an answer because they're close friends.
01:24:04
What do you say? What do you say to them? Well, it's interesting because I think that, yeah, the friends of mine who have reached out there are a little bogged down in the idea. Right. In the concept. And I don't think that's the relevant aspect, to be honest.
01:24:19
I don't think like if you give a one line description of why Howard Stern has been on the radio for 40 years successfully, it's not like shock jock who's not afraid to throw baloney at I don't know how you summed it up.
01:24:31
There's not the concept is irrelevant. It's it's him. And if you look at why he's so successful is that he's just fucking brutally honest. He tells everyone what he's thinking, embarrassing stuff. I remember one time this was so great. He came in. It was a Monday morning show. He was grumpy all morning. And Robin's like, You're grumpy, hon. He's like, Yeah, yeah, I've been grumpy for two days. And what was it?
01:24:58
Why did I get grumpy? I was sitting. Oh, my God. I know. When I got grumpy, it was right after I took a dump. I know it happened. I was reading a fucking article that said Ashton Kutcher has a billion dollars. And I was like, how the fuck might he's friends with Ashton? So the fact that he's a galaxy. But that would piss him off. I guess he has five hundred million. It's so wonderful.
01:25:22
Like, here's a guy with five hundred million sitting on a very nice toilet, presumably, and he's agitated that this other guy has a billion dollars. It's so human and wonderful. And I think most people would hide that about themselves. They wouldn't own that. They're that shitty and petty. And so I guess when people call me, I'm like, yeah, the concepts great and blah, blah, blah. You know, I may have a note or two about sustainability of a concept like I'll just go.
01:25:47
It feels a little limited to me because won't that be done in ten episodes or won't that be done in forty, whatever. But but mostly I just say, like, you know, if you're going to do it, you got to make the decision that you're going to be one hundred percent honest or it's not worth doing. And I don't think it'll work. And so often the people that are calling me are other public people. So that's kind of a big barrier for them, understandably.
01:26:09
And I just don't know that it works unless you are maybe I mean, if you have a real view of a procedural show like, let's say, making a murderer or not making a murderer, but those wonderful girls who have that want women who have the best podcast's, my favorite murder, if you if you're covering a case every time. Yeah. I think maybe you could you could have a premise driven one. But, you know, you better have a research.
01:26:34
You better be a Radiolab or this American Life. You've got a team of journalists that are going to go out there and build this incredible show over the course of six weeks and edit it into ninety minutes. But if you're just going to drive the show, if you're the content, then it better be like being your best friend or I just don't think it'll work. What are you thinking about right now? Well, I'm thinking that. You have to like the format you choose, if you don't like the format you choose, you're just not going to have the endurance also to do it for a long period of time.
01:27:11
And you're going to be if you are competitive and maybe that doesn't matter, maybe you're just doing it for the love of the game and you don't care if anyone listens.
01:27:19
But if you want to break through the noise, you need a certain degree of enthusiasm and endurance, both of which will be lacking if you don't enjoy the format you choose.
01:27:30
It just seems so. I agree. Fundamental as a decision.
01:27:35
You well, by the way, I talked to some friends where they're like, oh, I wanted to be about X, Y and Z and I'll go. I'm just going to point out, I've known you for 12 years. You've never brought that topic up to me. But I can tell you the topic you bring up all the time, which is like a home furnishing. I know you think because you're a director or an actor or this, you should be talking about that.
01:27:54
But you love home furnishing. That's what I know you like to talk about nonstop. Like, why isn't that what your show is? So I think first you just got to go, like, what am I endlessly talking about? And I know I don't go eight minutes into a conversation at any party or I haven't asked, did you give him a list like or they say something.
01:28:14
And I think, oh, I'm just curious, like, oh, is one of your parents like I noticed your husband is he's very quiet. Was your dad quite like that's all I'm interested in. I want to know why we're all we've all landed in these spots. And I think the clues are in your childhood. So that's all I talk about at parties, you know, and then that's all we talk about on the podcast.
01:28:35
Yeah. It's not it's you're not putting you're not changing wardrobe too much in terms of going on the show you.
01:28:44
Appear to be a voracious reader, and you read a whole lot, it seems. Are there any particular books that you gift to other people or recommend more than others?
01:28:56
Yeah, there's a number one. It's I can't stop talking about it. I've read it three times now. I will read it again soon.
01:29:05
Is Titan the Ron Chernow book about John D. Rockefeller Rockefeller. Have you read that book? I haven't seen the cover.
01:29:16
I tell you, it's a very for someone I can already tell like you like I'm blown away with the fact that you would have had someone go over your transcripts and point out things that you're doing wrong or that you would listen to find the errors.
01:29:31
This is a very if such a specific commitment to betterment, which is fascinating and and obviously very inspiring. That's why people adore you. I would have guessed Rockefeller was one way, and then in this book, I learn he's almost the opposite of everything I would have guessed about him. And that his approach to all these things was so unique and so confident, I don't know how this guy got this confidence his when he was running Standard Oil, which is a feat that will never be accomplished again.
01:30:07
I mean, the level of what he accomplishes is insane, but. Early on in the company, he set up a couch in his boardroom. He's a big believer, naps. He napped all every day now for a long time, and he would have all the board members at the table, but he'd be laying on a couch and he goes in and out and he listen to them talk and he knows. And then he just pop up with, like, one idea and that was good for him.
01:30:32
And then he walked home early that day like he's he was not what I would have thought and just his weird confidences. I just loved it. And then all of the things he is impacted is is there's not been an American that's had a bigger impact on life than him. There was no research medicine that didn't exist. He's the he funds the first research medical facility. He's the one who says, man, if you go get a procedure in Tennessee, those doctors have a totally different set of knowledge than the ones in New York.
01:31:05
No one's doing the same thing. Why is that? Oh, because all these medical schools, they don't have a unified curriculum. OK, who has the best curriculum in the country? Johns Hopkins. What if I take that curriculum and I pay universities to adopt it like he unifies medicine, he gets rid of hookworm. He just tackled anything. He was so cocky and confident in the things he tackled and he succeeded. He is an amazing person.
01:31:31
I can't read that book enough.
01:31:34
You've read it three times. You might read it again. What do you get? Because there's an information appeal, learning the bio and so on. But you have a great memory. You probably get that after two passes.
01:31:45
What do you gain from reading it a third time? A fourth time?
01:31:51
Well, funny, you know, it's a big book, so I do forget a lot. Yeah, it's not this is not this is not a you know, Charlie Brown.
01:31:58
Yeah. Even these are big books. Easy even as I'm talking you, there is a period where he somehow took took over all the shipping routes on Lake Erie. And I can't remember right now the exact mechanics of how he did that. And so that'll interest me.
01:32:13
How again, did he get a monopoly of the Lake Erie ship? You know, that's interesting. I want to find that out. I can't explain it because it's kind of like watching a favorite movie. It's like I enjoy it each time around. And then also I always recommend all the Jon Krakauer books. He's my favorite writer. Probably I yeah, I, I wouldn't even know what I want to say is the best, but where men win Glory is an incredible book.
01:32:36
Have you read that one?
01:32:37
I have not been an excellent writer there.
01:32:40
You'll see a theme here. I love when I find out something opposite of what I thought. It's what I like. Malcolm Gladwell write. Every single chapter is about some common sense assumption that we find out through testing is counterintuitive. I find that to be the most pleasing experience of going, oh my God, I'm dead wrong about that.
01:32:59
I would have thought that doesn't make any sense. I love that Pat Tillman. I remember when Pat Tillman quit the NFL and joined the Army because he wanted to go to Afghanistan. And when I heard that, I thought, what could explain that either here or my my guess is he's either a religious zealot and this is a crusade against Islam. Or two, this guy has done something so dark in his past that he has to atone in this insane way.
01:33:28
Those are my only guesses. I read that book Where Men Win Glory and in it's the Pat Tillman story. And I find out quickly it's not any of those things at all. And that this person had this level of integrity. I certainly don't possess and I don't think I've ever met anyone that has this level of integrity. Real quick, he was like last round pick to the Arizona Cardinals. He becomes one of the best safeties in the league.
01:33:53
He gets offered eight million dollars to go to St. Louis on a four year contract. Arizona only give him a one year contract for like a million bucks, and he stays in Arizona. He's like these people, but I mean, when no one would, I'm going to stay and get less money with less security because they deserve that, I wouldn't have done that. I would have fucking been shopping for a house in St. Louis or whatever team it was.
01:34:14
And the thing after thing in his life was like that. And so just like this incredible human that I've never gotten to meet in real life, that I get to meet through this book. And it's the opposite of everything I assumed. And he wasn't a jingoistic patriot, you know, he wasn't a in fact, he got immediately disillusioned because he got deployed to Iraq instead of Afghanistan and he didn't think we should be in Iraq. Then he goes to Afghanistan.
01:34:41
He's killed in friendly fire. There's a cover up. His brother uncovers it in the family and they speak out about it. They're like, you will not use him as the poster boy for the military because he was misled and lied to and then he was killed by a friend while Titan by Cherno.
01:35:01
Also at the top of the list, I'll I'll trade a recommendation, nothing more but Genghis Khan and the making of the modern world. If you haven't read that, I can't recall the author offhand. Hold on.
01:35:14
I got to write it down. I'm on this little PDA, so I can't spell Gamescom, but I'll figure it out. Ganga's.
01:35:20
Yeah. And what's what's the subtitle?
01:35:22
Genghis Khan While Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World. And this is right up my alley.
01:35:31
Yeah, yeah. This yeah. This this book. It sounds like we'll be right up your alley. It was recommended to me.
01:35:36
I'm not going to name his name because I don't know if he would want it to be named, but recommended to me by one of the best known CEOs in the United States and.
01:35:45
It's outstanding, and if you want to talk about. A portrayal of a person and their role in history that is counter to almost everything you might believe and all the preconceptions you might have, just the first 50 pages will leave you.
01:36:03
Just absolutely dazzled by how much of an impact on things we take for granted now Genghis Khan had. So that's that's that's a good read.
01:36:15
Can I just tell you my I have almost no knowledge of him other than then he invent the shock troop, the steer, the stirrup rider on a horse utilizing the mass of the horse to strike other soldiers. Was that his big invention warfare wise? There were a lot of military innovations, I don't recall using the weight of the horse.
01:36:39
Certainly he was very good at amassing and building an army by absorbing the engineers and warriors of the conquered. He was also very tolerant, even supportive of all religions, as long as they made sure to pray for Genghis Khan at some point.
01:37:02
Yeah, that's a that's a small request. And from from a logistics standpoint, I mean, the the type of warfare using.
01:37:13
These I mean, his scouting missions would defeat some of the most capable armies in the world, these were like advance teams that were scouting and they would defeat armies there would be considered, you know, the US or China of its today in terms of military power and his impact and the impact of his activities on logistics, I mean, ranging from postal services to beyond and just the sheer magnitude of what he did, even compared to Alexander the Great. I mean, it's staggering.
01:37:48
So it's it's it's a cool read and it's a really like some actual percentage of people on planet Earth have his genes.
01:37:57
Yeah, there's some absurd percentage. Again, they get cited is that I would need Monaca to fact check that. I know. I think it might be apocryphal, but who knows? I mean, it wouldn't it wouldn't surprise me. And it would also not surprise me if it were exaggerated.
01:38:13
Well, I have a I have a salacious personal experience I'll tell you about that is probably inflammatory.
01:38:19
But, you know, Marlon Brando had that island down in Bora Bora and my wife shot a movie there and we were there for six weeks. And I got to all the little islands in the eight, all I had gone diving things. And I met a lot of locals. And it is rumored there that he had that he had had like a dozen or so kids. Right. And I'm telling you, this is this is very anecdotal. But I I personally met several people that were clearly half Brando and half to Heesen, I guess.
01:38:57
And I thought, wouldn't it be hilarious if all of a sudden not not unlike when the Samoans overtook the NFL, if all of a sudden there was just a sweep at the Oscars for like a decade a stranger, things have happened.
01:39:16
So he might amount for some percentage there and then more.
01:39:22
Well, that's this is this. But a lot of fun. I want to ask just a few more questions and and then wrap up for this this round one. You know, you've been very forthcoming with a lot of your challenges over time. You do something that I respect a great deal which is not leading with solely the highlight reel. I think that that's a real service to people who are suffering, as we all are, in various ways, often self-inflicted wounds.
01:39:53
And I wanted to know if you have perhaps a favorite failure.
01:39:57
And what I mean by that is a mistake or something at the time that you viewed as a failure that in some ways set you up for success later.
01:40:07
There's anything that you gained from tremendously that at the time seemed like a shortcoming or a failure or a mistake.
01:40:13
I mean, the one that that that jumps out immediately and is is most relevant to this conversation is, you know, I was I was heartbroken when chips didn't open because back to my identity crisis, I had a three year stretch where in my mind I decided I was in an actor any more.
01:40:37
I was a writer director and I liked that it felt loftier.
01:40:41
Well, and substantively, I feel a lot more pride over having written a script than having acted. I do think it's harder, so some of it's worth worthwhile. But I had decided I was a writer director and that was going to be the next 10 years of my life had tested really high at Warner Brothers and they immediately put me on another movie that I took over from some other people. And so I was doing that.
01:41:02
And then overnight that ended. I did not have that identity anymore. And they had already commissioned ships, too. I was already beginning to write that. And I got very depressed, like for three, four months, maybe more I.
01:41:21
I started doing math and thinking, OK, could I retire now? Like, could I be done now if I live on this amount of money, blah, blah, blah? That's that's where I spent most of my time thinking about is whether I was completely done. And that's when I wanted to do the podcast. I was ruminating on so much stuff. I was thinking about my own life and identity and trajectory and the failure and and then I started it in the wake of that.
01:41:53
And I think because I was so interested in failure at that time, I say often on the podcast, I have nothing to learn from someone holding me over their head. I just won't I'll never be holding an Emmy over my head. But I can relate. If that person cheated on someone they loved and regretted, I can relate to the failures that led up to that. That's something I can learn from. And that's how I learned from people in AA.
01:42:18
I don't ever learn from someone telling some victory story. It's always how they fucked up and realized it.
01:42:23
And so now in hindsight, you know, had I have the thing I wanted. Which was of being a writer director, it's so time consuming, my kids were one in three when I finished that movie, maybe two and four, and I would have been gone. I would have taken bigger movies. I would have been way more into that. Ironically, I would have ended up making less money. So like this thing that I had no desire to do and this is complete collapse of this identity I had and desire turned out to be something that allows me to be with my kids at Tanum at home all the time.
01:43:06
My wife can take work out of town if she wants. I can travel and do this like this life that came out of this epic failure. This 20 year pursuit turned out to be something better than I had even thought to imagine. I didn't even know that this could exist, so, yeah, that's that's a very obvious one for me now that I look back and go like fuck and thank God that thing failed. I would have been right in that movie, then directing that movie, then trying to get them to give me one hundred million to do this one.
01:43:33
And by the way, movie business is collapsing. So I would have been doing all of that and in a time was almost impossible to do that. So, yeah, I got so lucky in that thing.
01:43:42
Not performing crazy enough. What a story to makes me think of something a friend of mine said. I can't recall who it was, but you just sometimes you need life to save you from what you want.
01:43:54
Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean, what a great life you go through your own life, right. And you think of the times you got exactly what you wanted and then the times you didn't get the thing you wanted. And what I know most is that I don't know what's best for me. The things I got that I wanted did not turn out or result in anything I had I had forecasts or dreamt of. And yet all these things I didn't want to do, I didn't want to be on TV.
01:44:20
I had decided in my egotistical mind I was a movie actor. I didn't want to be in TV. I reluctantly was on this show Parenthood, because I was at a low in my career. Best experience I've ever had as an actor, open up the doors for me to act and so many other things. Without question, the best thing that ever could have happened to me as an actor. And it was the thing I didn't want to do.
01:44:39
And, you know, I got to do the exact thing I want to do, right. Wheelies on motorcycles in a movie I directed. And it fucking didn't turn out. Yeah.
01:44:52
So just give me two more questions here. This is going to be. Question that sometimes sometimes turns out well and oftentimes does not. So we'll see where it goes. Well, it was a flaccid or hard to say, I'd say. I'd say this is I say this is a clear half chub question. So we're going to go with that.
01:45:16
And it is if you had a billboard, metaphorically speaking, to get any message, word, image out to billions of people. Could be anything non-commercial. What might you put on that billboard? Hmm? Wow, that's a bet's a big I feel like that would take me like a couple weeks to come up with the right answer for that. Let's see. Let's see. So I'm driving down the road, I'm going to see a billboard and what I most want to see.
01:45:48
OK, I got it. I think it's the message I most need to hear Elliott on me would be. Be as kind and forgiving to yourself as you are to the people you love. I'm I'm pretty fucking brutal to myself and all of a sudden to a guy in a meeting to share the exact same thing I just did, and I'm like, oh, that poor guy. It's hard, of course, that happened.
01:46:15
But for me, I'm like, you are the piece of shit I always knew you were. Here's more proof. You don't deserve love from anyone.
01:46:26
That is the billboard I would also most need to see.
01:46:29
So I appreciate that answer.
01:46:31
Well, and DAX, I really appreciate you as a student of life, as a presenter of Personal Truth, including when it is uncomfortable. And I really believe that the.
01:46:50
Exploration of vulnerability and story and sort of shared difficulty on your podcast is a real service to your listeners. So I want to commend you for that and thank you for that. Thank you. You're welcome.
01:47:07
And the people that want that need to hear it the most are us boys. And that only girls are listening, I feel like we're the ones that just, you know, it's all about weakness and strength for us. It's so stupid.
01:47:21
Oh, yeah. Well, you know, I am probably the mirror image of your podcast in terms of demographic.
01:47:29
I would guess that I'm around between 60 and 70 percent male. So certainly a lot of men and women will have listened to this episode. And you've given a lot of food for thought. Where can people find you, learn more about you? Where would you like them to check you out? Well, they should read my autobiography Horsepower Story.
01:47:53
No, I'm on Instagram, I think, just under my name tag. Shepard and then. Yeah. And then armchair expert, if anyone would like to listen to the podcast, it's on all of the. So Rob tells me it's on all of the many platforms people consume their podcasts on and know.
01:48:12
I think that's it for me.
01:48:13
I hate Twitter. I'm on it, but only to promote the show. What a cancerous black hole that places.
01:48:20
Yeah, a lot. A lot of people peeing in the pool on Twitter. Oh, ruins the fun.
01:48:27
Well, thank you so much for taking the time to have this conversation, Decs.
01:48:32
Yeah, it was awesome. I can't wait to interview you. Yeah. Yeah. Like, well, we'll give it a like a month lull so we both get interested in each other again.
01:48:42
Separation makes the heart grow fonder and we'll do that. And to everyone listening, thank you for tuning in.
01:48:49
And you can find show notes for everything we discussed, including armchair experts, including Horsepower, his brand new autobiography, and and all of the social handles and everything at Tind blog for its podcast.
01:49:03
And until next time, be safe. And if your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete.
01:49:09
To quote Jack Kornfield. Hmm, that's good. That should be the billboard. Yeah. Hey, guys, this is Tim again. Just a few more things before you take off. Number one, this is five bullet Friday. Do you want to get a short email from me? And would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday if that provides a little morsel of fun before the weekend and five? Black Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been pondering over the week that could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

It could include gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've somehow dug up into the world of the esoteric as I do. It could include favorite articles that I have read and that I've shared with my close friends, for instance. And it's very short. It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend. So if you want to receive that, check it out. Just go to four hour work week dotcom.

It's performance apparel, but it can be used for working out. It can be used for going out to dinner.
01:50:38
At least in my case. I feel very comfortable with it. Super comfortable, super stylish. And I just want to read something that one of my employees said. She is an athlete. She is quite technical, although she would never say that. I asked her if she had ever used or heard of Yori and this was her response. I do love their stuff and using them for about a year. I think I found that when I first for my partner t shirts that are super soft with some help last as he's hard on stuff.
01:51:05
And then I got into the super soft cotton yoga pants and jogger sweatpants. I live in them and they too have lasted. They're stylish enough. I can wear them out and about. The material is just super soft and durable. Just got there clementino running shorts for summer and love them. The brand seems pretty popular, constantly sold out. In closing, I'm abbreviating here but inclosing with the exception of when I need technical outdoor gear. They're the only brand I've bought in the last year or so for yoga running at loungewear that lasts and that I think look good.
01:51:33
Also, I like the discrete logo, so that gives you some idea that was not intended for the sponsor. That was just her response. Mutex Vieri against WRI is designed for maximum comfort and versatility. You can wear it running, you can wear their stuff training, doing yoga, lounging weekend errands, or in my case, again, going out to dinner. It really doesn't matter what you're doing. Their clothing is so comfortable and looks so good and it's it's not offensive.
01:52:04
You don't have a huge brand logo on your face. You'll just want to be in the launch time. And my girlfriend and I have been wearing them for the last few months, their men's clothes.

This episode is brought to you by Oura oh, you are a it is the only wearable that I wear on a daily basis. Ora is the company behind the smart ring that delivers personalized sleep and health insights to help you optimize just about everything. And I've tried every device out there that you can imagine. This one really makes the cut. I've been using it religiously for at least six months now, and I was introduced to it by Dr. Peter Attia, who's also vetted just about everything with advanced sensors or a state of the art, heart rate, heart rate variability.
01:54:15
HRB super important to me, temperature activity and sleep monitoring technology into a convenient, non-invasive ring. It's tiny. It weighs less than six grams and focuses on three key insights sleep readiness and activity. So I can use it to help focus my attention on the type, volume, intensity of exercise that I should do in a given day. I use it to determine how certain types of alcohol at different times of the day affect my sleep, which they do, and I can see all of that in graph form trended over time.
01:54:47
There are tons of actionable insights that have come from using this right for me. They have a number of incredible people on their team. Dr. Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at UC Berkeley and also author of Why We Sleep in the Mega hit is or is chief science adviser. As just one example. The Oring is one of the most accurate wearables available because it measures your vitals directly from your finger. So it's not deducing that or making a best guesstimate based on a bunch of other things and trying to triangulate compared to a medical grade electrocardiogram.
01:55:23
The ordering is ninety nine point nine percent accurate for resting heart rate and ninety eight point four percent accurate for heart rate variability. And I work with HRB doctors and they recommend that I use the Oring, so try it yourself. It is super cool and super practical, very actionable.
