I've been hosting this podcast called Artificial Intelligence for over two years now, I decided to change the name to just Lex Friedman's podcast for several reasons. First, that's what most people call it anyway.

Second, I've already been interviewing physicists, historians, philosophers, mathematicians, writers, athletes. Switching away from A.I. in the name gives me the freedom to do that a little bit more.

I still want to talk to the top researchers in artificial intelligence and science and tech in general, but also people who inspire me and have had a big impact on my life outside of science and tech.

Third, most practically, I've found that guest even slightly outside the field of A.I., like neuroscience, neurobiology, physics, chemistry, math, have been intimidated by the name A.I. So going with a silly generic name, my name just seems easier. Hopefully you see that I try hard to make the guest, the star of the show, not to take myself too seriously or seriously at all. And always that's the simplest possible questions. And in hopes of arriving at something fundamental and even beautiful, even if it makes me look like an idiot, which I very often am.

RSS feed is still the same, everything is still the same, if you enjoy this thing, share it with others, your kind words as before, as always, and your love has been fuel for me, for which I'm forever grateful. Version 3.0 will be outside the simulation, but for now, let us stay here a little longer. All of you are.
