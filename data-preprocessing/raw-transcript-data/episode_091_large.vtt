00:00.000 --> 00:02.520
 The following is a conversation with Jack Dorsey,

00:02.520 --> 00:05.160
 co founder and CEO of Twitter

00:05.160 --> 00:08.760
 and founder and CEO of Square.

00:08.760 --> 00:12.240
 Given the happenings at the time related to Twitter leadership

00:12.240 --> 00:13.960
 and the very limited time we had,

00:13.960 --> 00:16.680
 we decided to focus this conversation on Square

00:16.680 --> 00:18.880
 and some broader philosophical topics

00:18.880 --> 00:20.840
 and to save an in depth conversation

00:20.840 --> 00:23.080
 on engineering and AI at Twitter

00:23.080 --> 00:25.840
 for a second appearance in this podcast.

00:25.840 --> 00:27.320
 This conversation was recorded

00:27.320 --> 00:29.480
 before the outbreak of the pandemic.

00:29.480 --> 00:31.880
 For everyone feeling the medical, psychological

00:31.880 --> 00:33.840
 and financial burden of this crisis,

00:33.840 --> 00:35.520
 I'm sending love your way.

00:35.520 --> 00:36.560
 Stay strong.

00:36.560 --> 00:37.720
 We're in this together.

00:37.720 --> 00:38.800
 We'll beat this thing.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.480
 As an aside, let me mention

00:41.480 --> 00:45.280
 that Jack moved $1 billion of Square equity,

00:45.280 --> 00:47.560
 which is 28% of his wealth

00:47.560 --> 00:51.440
 to form an organization that funds COVID 19 relief.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.840
 First, as Andrew Yang tweeted,

00:53.840 --> 00:56.280
 this is a spectacular commitment.

00:56.280 --> 00:59.600
 And second, it is amazing that it operates transparently

00:59.600 --> 01:03.360
 by posting all its donations to a single Google doc.

01:03.360 --> 01:06.160
 To me, true transparency is simple.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.320
 And this is as simple as it gets.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.840

01:40.840 --> 01:42.440
 When I first heard about Masterclass,

01:42.440 --> 01:44.360
 I thought it was too good to be true.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.520

01:49.600 --> 01:51.360
 to list some of my favorites,

01:51.360 --> 01:53.680
 Chris Hadfield on space exploration,

01:53.680 --> 01:55.800
 Neil deGrasse Tyson on scientific thinking

01:55.800 --> 01:57.000
 and communication,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
 Will Wright, creator of SimCity and Sims,

02:00.000 --> 02:03.160
 both one of my favorite games on game design,

02:03.160 --> 02:05.520
 Jane Goodall on conservation,

02:05.520 --> 02:07.200
 Carlos Santana on guitar,

02:07.200 --> 02:08.960
 one of my favorite guitar players,

02:08.960 --> 02:10.760
 Gary Kasparov on chess,

02:10.760 --> 02:13.960
 Daniel Nagrano on poker and many, many more.

02:13.960 --> 02:17.040
 Chris Hadfield explaining how rockets work

02:17.040 --> 02:19.520
 and the experience of being launched into space alone

02:19.520 --> 02:20.840
 is worth the money.

02:20.840 --> 02:22.640
 For me, the key is to not be overwhelmed

02:22.640 --> 02:24.280
 by the abundance of choice.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.400
 Pick three courses you want to complete,

02:26.400 --> 02:28.240
 watch each all the way through.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.440
 It's not that long,

02:29.440 --> 02:31.120
 but it's an experience that will stick with you

02:31.120 --> 02:32.880
 for a long time.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.640
 It's easily worth the money.

02:34.640 --> 02:37.280
 You can watch it on basically any device.

 And now, here's my conversation with Jack Dorsey.

02:48.840 --> 02:50.720
 You've been on several podcasts,

02:50.720 --> 02:53.520
 Joe Rogan, Sam Harris, Rach Roll, others,

02:53.520 --> 02:55.280
 excellent conversations,

02:55.280 --> 02:57.520
 but I think there's several topics

02:57.520 --> 03:00.040
 that you didn't talk about that I think are fascinating

03:00.040 --> 03:01.780
 that I'd love to talk to you about,

03:01.780 --> 03:04.160
 sort of machine learning, artificial intelligence,

03:04.160 --> 03:06.280
 both the narrow kind and the general kind

03:06.280 --> 03:08.560
 and engineering at scale.

03:08.560 --> 03:11.240
 So there's a lot of incredible engineering going on

03:11.240 --> 03:12.400
 that you're a part of,

03:12.400 --> 03:16.240
 crypto, cryptocurrency, blockchain, UBI,

03:16.240 --> 03:18.640
 all kinds of philosophical questions maybe we'll get to

03:18.640 --> 03:21.660
 about life and death and meaning and beauty.

03:21.660 --> 03:24.520
 So you're involved in building some of

03:25.480 --> 03:27.800
 the biggest network systems in the world,

03:27.800 --> 03:30.840
 sort of trillions of interactions a day.

03:30.840 --> 03:33.160
 The cool thing about that is the infrastructure,

03:33.160 --> 03:35.080
 the engineering at scale.

03:35.080 --> 03:38.600
 You started as a programmer with C building.

03:38.600 --> 03:39.420
 Yeah, so.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.080
 I'm a hacker, I'm not really an engineer.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.000
 Not a legit software engineer,

03:43.000 --> 03:44.360
 you're a hacker at heart.

03:44.360 --> 03:47.280
 But to achieve scale, you have to do some,

03:47.280 --> 03:49.920
 unfortunately, legit large scale engineering.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.800
 So how do you make that magic happen?

03:52.800 --> 03:57.540
 Hire people that I can learn from, number one.

03:57.540 --> 04:00.280
 I mean, I'm a hacker in the sense that I,

04:00.280 --> 04:02.340
 my approach has always been do whatever it takes

04:02.340 --> 04:03.180
 to make it work.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.640
 So that I can see and feel the thing

04:07.640 --> 04:09.540
 and then learn what needs to come next.

04:09.540 --> 04:13.260
 And oftentimes what needs to come next is

04:13.260 --> 04:16.260
 a matter of being able to bring it to more people,

04:16.260 --> 04:17.520
 which is scale.

04:17.520 --> 04:21.960
 And there's a lot of great people out there

04:21.960 --> 04:26.200
 that either have experience or are extremely fast learners

04:27.760 --> 04:30.200
 that we've been lucky enough to find

04:30.200 --> 04:33.680
 and work with for years.

04:33.680 --> 04:35.440
 But I think a lot of it,

04:35.440 --> 04:39.560
 we benefit a ton from the open source community

04:39.560 --> 04:41.460
 and just all the learnings there

04:41.460 --> 04:44.480
 that are laid bare in the open.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.480
 All the mistakes, all the success,

04:46.480 --> 04:48.640
 all the problems.

04:48.640 --> 04:53.420
 It's a very slow moving process usually open source,

04:53.420 --> 04:54.600
 but it's very deliberate.

04:54.600 --> 04:58.520
 And you get to see because of the pace,

04:58.520 --> 05:00.280
 you get to see what it takes

05:00.280 --> 05:02.600
 to really build something meaningful.

05:02.600 --> 05:06.680
 So I learned most of everything I learned about hacking

05:06.680 --> 05:11.000
 and programming and engineering has been due to open source

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
 and the generosity that people have given

05:19.720 --> 05:21.640
 to give up their time, sacrifice their time

05:21.640 --> 05:24.440
 without any expectation in return,

05:24.440 --> 05:27.320
 other than being a part of something

05:27.320 --> 05:29.800
 much larger than themselves, which I think is great.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.400
 Open source movement is amazing.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.520
 But if you just look at the scale,

05:33.520 --> 05:35.660
 like Square has to take care of,

05:35.660 --> 05:38.720
 is this fundamentally a software problem

05:38.720 --> 05:39.760
 or a hardware problem?

05:39.760 --> 05:41.900
 You mentioned hiring a bunch of people,

05:41.900 --> 05:45.880
 but it's not, maybe from my perspective,

05:45.880 --> 05:48.920
 not often talked about how incredible that is

05:48.920 --> 05:52.160
 to sort of have a system that doesn't go down often,

05:52.160 --> 05:54.500
 that is secure, is able to take care

05:54.500 --> 05:55.960
 of all these transactions.

05:55.960 --> 05:58.800
 Like maybe I'm also a hacker at heart

05:58.800 --> 06:01.100
 and it's incredible to me that that kind of scale

06:01.100 --> 06:02.200
 could be achieved.

06:02.200 --> 06:06.380
 Is there some insight, some lessons,

06:06.380 --> 06:10.080
 some interesting tidbits that you can say

06:10.080 --> 06:12.280
 how to make that scale happen?

06:12.280 --> 06:14.240
 Is it the hardware fundamentally challenge?

06:14.240 --> 06:16.000
 Is it a software challenge?

06:19.200 --> 06:23.800
 Is it a social challenge of building large teams

06:23.800 --> 06:25.520
 of engineers that work together, that kind of thing?

06:25.520 --> 06:28.560
 Like what's the interesting challenges there?

06:28.560 --> 06:31.040
 By the way, you're the best dressed hacker I've met.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.300
 I think the. Thank you.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.000
 If the enumeration you just went through,

06:36.000 --> 06:37.360
 I don't think there's one.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.760
 You have to kind of focus on all

06:39.760 --> 06:43.120
 and the ability to focus on all that

06:43.120 --> 06:47.040
 really comes down to how you face problems

06:47.040 --> 06:51.000
 and whether you can break them down into parts

06:51.000 --> 06:53.600
 that you can focus on.

06:53.600 --> 06:58.200
 Because I think the biggest mistake is trying to solve

06:58.200 --> 07:00.780
 or address too many at once

07:02.300 --> 07:05.200
 or not going deep enough with the questions

07:05.200 --> 07:08.660
 or not being critical of the answers you find

07:08.660 --> 07:13.660
 or not taking the time to form credible hypotheses

07:15.720 --> 07:19.480
 that you can actually test and you can see the results of.

07:19.480 --> 07:24.480
 So all of those fall in the face of ultimately

07:25.520 --> 07:27.880
 critical thinking skills, problem solving skills.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.720
 And if there's one skill I want to improve every day,

07:30.720 --> 07:34.960
 it's that that's what contributes to the learning

07:34.960 --> 07:38.800
 and the only way we can evolve any of these things

07:38.800 --> 07:41.440
 is learning what it's currently doing

07:41.440 --> 07:44.320
 and how to take it to the next step.

07:44.320 --> 07:45.540
 And questioning assumptions,

07:45.540 --> 07:47.200
 the first principles kind of thinking,

07:47.200 --> 07:50.640
 seems like a fundamental to this whole process.

07:50.640 --> 07:53.260
 Yeah, but if you get too overextended into,

07:53.260 --> 07:54.960
 well, this is a hardware issue,

07:54.960 --> 07:56.940
 you miss all the software solutions.

07:56.940 --> 08:01.940
 And vice versa, if you focus too much on the software,

08:01.940 --> 08:06.700
 there are hardware solutions that can 10X the thing.

08:06.700 --> 08:11.700
 So I try to resist the categories of thinking

08:13.420 --> 08:16.080
 and look for the underlying systems

08:16.080 --> 08:18.100
 that make all these things work.

08:18.100 --> 08:22.540
 But those only emerge when you have a skill

08:22.540 --> 08:27.180
 around creative thinking, problem solving,

08:27.180 --> 08:32.180
 and being able to ask critical questions

08:33.620 --> 08:35.460
 and having the patience to go deep.

08:36.420 --> 08:38.460
 So one of the amazing things,

08:38.460 --> 08:40.580
 if we look at the mission of Square,

08:40.580 --> 08:45.020
 is to increase people's access to the economy.

08:45.020 --> 08:46.840
 Maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong,

08:46.840 --> 08:47.900
 that's from my perspective.

08:47.900 --> 08:49.560
 So from the perspective of merchants,

08:49.560 --> 08:52.780
 peer to peer payments, even crypto, cryptocurrency,

08:52.780 --> 08:56.140
 digital cryptocurrency, what do you see as the major ways

08:56.140 --> 08:59.460
 that our society can increase participation in the economy?

08:59.460 --> 09:01.420
 So if we look at today and the next 10 years,

09:01.420 --> 09:04.380
 next 20 years, you go into Africa, maybe in Africa

09:04.380 --> 09:07.560
 and all kinds of other places outside of the North America.

09:09.380 --> 09:13.980
 If there was one word that I think represents

09:13.980 --> 09:17.220
 what we're trying to do at Square, it is that word access.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.820
 One of the things we found is that

09:21.820 --> 09:23.500
 we weren't expecting this at all.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.300
 When we started, we thought we were just building

09:25.300 --> 09:29.140
 a piece of hardware to enable people

09:29.140 --> 09:32.100
 to plug it into their phone and swipe a credit card.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.420
 And then as we talked with people

09:34.420 --> 09:37.660
 who actually tried to accept credit cards in the past,

09:37.660 --> 09:40.460
 we found a consistent theme, which many of them

09:40.460 --> 09:44.100
 weren't even enabled, not enabled,

09:44.100 --> 09:46.580
 but allowed to process credit cards.

09:46.580 --> 09:50.580
 And we dug a little bit deeper, again, asking that question.

09:50.580 --> 09:54.300
 And we found that a lot of them would go to banks

09:54.300 --> 09:57.260
 or these merchant acquirers.

09:57.260 --> 10:01.000
 And waiting for them was a credit check

10:01.000 --> 10:03.220
 and looking at a FICA score.

10:03.220 --> 10:07.700
 And many of the businesses that we talked to

10:07.700 --> 10:09.580
 and many small businesses,

10:09.580 --> 10:13.580
 they don't have good credit or a credit history.

10:15.220 --> 10:17.780
 They're entrepreneurs who are just getting started,

10:17.780 --> 10:20.120
 taking a lot of personal risk, financial risk.

10:21.300 --> 10:24.060
 And it just felt ridiculous to us

10:24.060 --> 10:29.060
 that for the job of being able to accept money from people,

10:31.980 --> 10:33.700
 you had to get your credit checked.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.500
 And as we dug deeper, we realized that

10:36.500 --> 10:38.540
 that wasn't the intention of the financial industry,

10:38.540 --> 10:42.220
 but it's the only tool they had available to them

10:42.220 --> 10:45.540
 to understand authenticity, intent,

10:46.400 --> 10:49.140
 predictor of future behavior.

10:49.140 --> 10:50.820
 So that's the first thing we actually looked at.

10:50.820 --> 10:52.620
 And that's where the, you know, we built the hardware,

10:52.620 --> 10:57.460
 but the software really came in terms of risk modeling.

10:57.460 --> 11:00.700
 And that's when we started down the path

11:00.700 --> 11:03.040
 that eventually leads to AI.

11:03.040 --> 11:07.620
 We started with a very strong data science discipline

11:08.580 --> 11:10.260
 because we knew that our business

11:10.260 --> 11:13.860
 was not necessarily about making hardware.

11:13.860 --> 11:17.080
 It was more about enabling more people

11:17.080 --> 11:18.620
 to come into the system.

11:18.620 --> 11:21.220
 So the fundamental challenge there is,

11:21.220 --> 11:23.420
 so to enable more people to come into the system,

11:23.420 --> 11:26.780
 you have to lower the barrier of checking

11:26.780 --> 11:30.500
 that that person will be a legitimate vendor.

11:30.500 --> 11:31.740
 Is that the fundamental problem?

11:31.740 --> 11:33.980
 Yeah, and a different mindset.

11:33.980 --> 11:36.340
 I think a lot of the financial industry had a mindset

11:36.340 --> 11:41.340
 of kind of distrust and just constantly looking

11:41.340 --> 11:46.340
 for opportunities to prove why people shouldn't get

11:46.340 --> 11:50.340
 into the system, whereas we took on a mindset of trust

11:50.340 --> 11:52.980
 and then verify, verify, verify, verify, verify.

11:52.980 --> 11:53.820
 Yes.

11:53.820 --> 11:58.820
 So we moved, you know, when we entered the space,

12:00.100 --> 12:03.260
 only about 30 to 40% of the people who applied

12:03.260 --> 12:05.860
 to accept credit cards would actually get through the system.

12:05.860 --> 12:08.700
 We took that knowledge, we took it to the next level.

12:08.700 --> 12:11.540
 If we applied to accept credit cards,

12:11.540 --> 12:13.180
 we'd actually get through the system.

12:13.180 --> 12:15.620
 We took that number to 99%.

12:15.620 --> 12:19.100
 And that's because we reframed the problem,

12:19.100 --> 12:24.100
 we built credible models, and we had this mindset of,

12:25.540 --> 12:28.420
 we're going to watch not at the merchant level,

12:28.420 --> 12:30.740
 but we're gonna watch at the transaction level.

12:30.740 --> 12:35.020
 So come in, perform some transactions,

12:35.020 --> 12:36.620
 and as long as you're doing things

12:36.620 --> 12:40.460
 with integrity, credible, and don't look suspicious,

12:40.460 --> 12:43.300
 we'll continue to serve you.

12:43.300 --> 12:47.620
 If we see any interestingness in how you use our system,

12:47.620 --> 12:50.780
 that will be bubbled up to people to review,

12:50.780 --> 12:53.460
 to figure out if there's something nefarious going on,

12:53.460 --> 12:56.020
 and that's when we might ask you to leave.

12:56.020 --> 13:01.020
 So the change in the mindset led to the technology

13:01.020 --> 13:06.020
 that we needed to enable more people to get through,

13:06.460 --> 13:08.900
 and to enable more people to access the system.

13:08.900 --> 13:11.780
 What role does machine learning play into that,

13:11.780 --> 13:15.340
 in that context of, you said,

13:15.340 --> 13:17.580
 first of all, it's a beautiful shift.

13:17.580 --> 13:20.500
 Anytime you shift your viewpoint into seeing

13:20.500 --> 13:23.120
 that people are fundamentally good,

13:24.020 --> 13:25.860
 and then you just have to verify

13:25.860 --> 13:27.660
 and catch the ones who are not,

13:27.660 --> 13:30.300
 as opposed to assuming everybody's bad,

13:30.300 --> 13:31.580
 this is a beautiful thing.

13:31.580 --> 13:35.020
 So what role does the, to you,

13:35.940 --> 13:37.300
 throughout the history of the company,

13:37.300 --> 13:40.500
 has machine learning played in doing that verification?

13:40.500 --> 13:41.820
 It was immediate.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.420
 I mean, we weren't calling it machine learning,

13:43.420 --> 13:45.260
 but it was data science.

13:45.260 --> 13:47.600
 And then as the industry evolved,

13:47.600 --> 13:50.020
 machine learning became more of the nomenclature,

13:50.020 --> 13:54.820
 and as that evolved, it became more sophisticated

13:54.820 --> 13:58.740
 with deep learning, and as that continues to evolve,

13:58.740 --> 13:59.940
 it'll be another thing.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.180
 But they're all in the same vein.

14:02.180 --> 14:04.420
 But we built that discipline up

14:04.420 --> 14:06.940
 within the first year of the company,

14:06.940 --> 14:11.940
 because we also had, we had to partner with a bank,

14:11.940 --> 14:14.340
 we had to partner with Visa and MasterCard,

14:14.340 --> 14:16.160
 and we had to show that,

14:16.160 --> 14:19.260
 by bringing more people into the system,

14:19.260 --> 14:21.460
 that we could do so in a responsible way,

14:21.460 --> 14:23.700
 that would not compromise their systems,

14:23.700 --> 14:25.260
 and that they would trust us.

14:25.260 --> 14:27.820
 How do you convince this upstart company

14:27.820 --> 14:30.620
 with some cool machine learning tricks

14:30.620 --> 14:35.620
 is able to deliver on this trustworthy set of merchants?

14:35.700 --> 14:37.900
 We staged it out in tiers.

14:37.900 --> 14:41.300
 We had a bucket of 500 people using it,

14:41.300 --> 14:43.040
 and then we showed results,

14:43.040 --> 14:45.700
 and then 1,000, and then 10,000, then 50,000,

14:45.700 --> 14:49.940
 and then the constraint was lifted.

14:49.940 --> 14:54.180
 So again, it's kind of getting something tangible out there.

14:54.180 --> 14:58.220
 I want to show what we can do rather than talk about it.

14:58.220 --> 15:00.180
 And that put a lot of pressure on us

15:00.180 --> 15:01.620
 to do the right things.

15:02.900 --> 15:07.300
 And it also created a culture of accountability,

15:07.300 --> 15:09.560
 of a little bit more transparency,

15:10.760 --> 15:15.760
 and I think incentivized all of our early folks

15:15.980 --> 15:18.140
 and the company in the right way.

15:18.140 --> 15:19.900
 So what does the future look like

15:19.900 --> 15:21.920
 in terms of increasing people's access?

15:21.920 --> 15:25.420
 Or if you look at IoT, Internet of Things,

15:25.420 --> 15:27.260
 there's more and more intelligent devices.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.620
 You can see there's some people even talking

15:29.620 --> 15:32.220
 about our personal data as a thing

15:32.220 --> 15:35.940
 that we could monetize more explicitly versus implicitly.

15:35.940 --> 15:38.460
 Sort of everything can become part of the economy.

15:38.460 --> 15:41.420
 Do you see, so what does the future of Square look like

15:41.420 --> 15:45.620
 in sort of giving people access in all kinds of ways

15:45.620 --> 15:49.240
 to being part of the economy as merchants and as consumers?

15:49.240 --> 15:52.500
 I believe that the currency we use

15:52.500 --> 15:55.740
 is a huge part of the answer.

15:55.740 --> 15:58.980
 And I believe that the internet deserves

15:58.980 --> 16:01.780
 and requires a native currency.

16:01.780 --> 16:06.420
 And that's why I'm such a huge believer in Bitcoin

16:07.260 --> 16:10.340
 because it just,

16:11.480 --> 16:13.540
 our biggest problem as a company right now

16:13.540 --> 16:16.380
 is we cannot act like an internet company.

16:16.380 --> 16:17.300
 Open a new market,

16:17.300 --> 16:20.020
 we have to have a partnership with a local bank.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.180
 We have to pay attention

16:21.180 --> 16:24.360
 to different regulatory onboarding environments.

16:25.860 --> 16:29.980
 And a digital currency like Bitcoin

16:29.980 --> 16:31.660
 takes a bunch of that away

16:31.660 --> 16:35.260
 where we can potentially launch a product

16:35.260 --> 16:37.260
 in every single market around the world

16:38.660 --> 16:41.180
 because they're all using the same currency.

16:41.180 --> 16:46.180
 And we have consistent understanding of regulation

16:46.180 --> 16:49.560
 and onboarding and what that means.

16:49.560 --> 16:54.460
 So I think the internet continuing to be accessible

16:54.460 --> 16:57.480
 to people is number one.

16:57.480 --> 17:00.320
 And then I think currency is number two.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.320
 And it will just allow for a lot more innovation,

17:04.320 --> 17:07.800
 a lot more speed in terms of what we can build

17:07.800 --> 17:09.160
 and others can build.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.860
 And it's just really exciting.

17:11.860 --> 17:13.760
 So, I mean, I wanna be able to see that

17:13.760 --> 17:16.240
 and feel that in my lifetime.

17:16.240 --> 17:19.000
 So in this aspect and in other aspects,

17:19.000 --> 17:22.040
 you have a deep interest in cryptocurrency

17:22.040 --> 17:24.040
 and distributed ledger tech in general.

17:24.040 --> 17:27.760
 I talked to Vitalik Buterin yesterday on this podcast.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.040
 He says hi, by the way.

17:29.040 --> 17:29.880
 Hey.

17:29.880 --> 17:33.960
 He's a brilliant, brilliant person.

17:33.960 --> 17:36.160
 Talked a lot about Bitcoin and Ethereum, of course.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.560
 So can you maybe linger on this point?

17:38.560 --> 17:42.400
 What do you find appealing about Bitcoin,

17:42.400 --> 17:43.720
 about digital currency?

17:43.720 --> 17:46.960
 Where do you see it going in the next 10, 20 years?

17:46.960 --> 17:50.740
 And what are some of the challenges with respect to Square

17:50.740 --> 17:55.320
 but also just bigger for our globally, for our world,

17:55.320 --> 17:58.420
 for the way we think about money?

17:59.360 --> 18:01.560
 I think the most beautiful thing about it

18:01.560 --> 18:04.180
 is there's no one person setting the direction.

18:05.880 --> 18:07.760
 And there's no one person on the other side

18:07.760 --> 18:08.600
 that can stop it.

18:08.600 --> 18:13.600
 So we have something that is pretty organic in nature

18:15.160 --> 18:18.400
 and very principled in its original design.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.400
 And I think the Bitcoin white paper

18:22.400 --> 18:24.660
 is one of the most seminal works of computer science

18:24.660 --> 18:27.260
 in the last 20, 30 years.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.020
 It's poetry.

18:30.020 --> 18:30.860
 I mean, it really is.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.180
 Yeah, it's a pretty cool technology.

18:32.180 --> 18:33.640
 That's not often talked about.

18:33.640 --> 18:36.940
 There's so much hype around digital currency

18:36.940 --> 18:38.580
 about the financial impacts of it.

18:38.580 --> 18:40.520
 But the actual technology is quite beautiful

18:40.520 --> 18:42.200
 from a computer science perspective.

18:42.200 --> 18:44.320
 Yeah, and the underlying principles behind it

18:44.320 --> 18:46.000
 that went into it, even to the point

18:46.000 --> 18:47.700
 of releasing it under a pseudonym.

18:48.660 --> 18:51.320
 I think that's a very, very powerful statement.

18:51.320 --> 18:54.200
 The timing of when it was released is powerful.

18:54.200 --> 18:58.180
 It was a total activist move.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.560
 I mean, it's moving the world forward

19:00.560 --> 19:05.560
 in a way that I think is extremely noble and honorable

19:05.560 --> 19:08.920
 and enables everyone to be part of the story,

19:08.920 --> 19:10.400
 which is also really cool.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.880
 So you asked a question around 10 years and 20 years.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.840
 I mean, I think the amazing thing is no one knows.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.040
 And it can emerge.

19:19.040 --> 19:22.200
 And every person that comes into the ecosystem,

19:22.200 --> 19:26.680
 whether they be a developer or someone who uses it,

19:27.680 --> 19:30.880
 can change its direction in small and large ways.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.160
 And that's what I think it should be,

19:33.160 --> 19:36.080
 because that's what the internet has shown is possible.

19:36.080 --> 19:38.360
 Now, there's complications with that, of course.

19:38.360 --> 19:42.480
 And there's certainly companies that own large parts

19:42.480 --> 19:44.440
 of the internet and can direct it more than others.

19:44.440 --> 19:47.880
 And there's not equal access

19:47.880 --> 19:50.160
 to every single person in the world just yet.

19:50.160 --> 19:53.320
 But all those problems are visible enough

19:53.320 --> 19:54.640
 to speak about them.

19:54.640 --> 19:57.560
 And to me, that gives confidence that they're solvable

19:57.560 --> 20:00.720
 in a relatively short timeframe.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.760
 I think the world should be able to do that.

20:02.760 --> 20:06.960
 I think the world changes a lot as we get these satellites

20:08.200 --> 20:11.560
 projecting the internet down to earth,

20:11.560 --> 20:14.320
 because it just removes a bunch of the former constraints

20:15.240 --> 20:18.280
 and really levels the playing field.

20:18.280 --> 20:20.480
 But a global currency,

20:20.480 --> 20:24.920
 which a native currency for the internet is a proxy for,

20:24.920 --> 20:27.040
 is a very powerful concept.

20:27.040 --> 20:29.080
 And I don't think any one person on this planet

20:29.080 --> 20:31.560
 truly understands the ramifications of that.

20:31.560 --> 20:34.120
 I think there's a lot of positives to it.

20:34.120 --> 20:35.880
 There's some negatives as well.

20:35.880 --> 20:36.720
 But...

20:36.720 --> 20:37.560
 Do you think it's possible, sorry to interrupt,

20:37.560 --> 20:40.840
 do you think it's possible that this kind of digital currency

20:40.840 --> 20:43.440
 would redefine the nature of money,

20:43.440 --> 20:46.400
 so become the main currency of the world,

20:46.400 --> 20:49.080
 as opposed to being tied to fiat currency

20:49.080 --> 20:51.960
 of different nations and sort of really push

20:51.960 --> 20:54.880
 the decentralization of control of money?

20:54.880 --> 20:58.160
 Definitely, but I think the bigger ramification

20:58.160 --> 21:02.280
 is how it affects how society works.

21:02.280 --> 21:06.240
 And I think there are many positive ramifications

21:06.240 --> 21:07.600
 outside of just money.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.800
 Outside of just money.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.160
 Money is a foundational layer that enables so much more.

21:12.160 --> 21:14.920
 I was meeting with an entrepreneur in Ethiopia,

21:14.920 --> 21:19.840
 and payments is probably the number one problem to solve

21:19.840 --> 21:20.920
 across the continent,

21:21.840 --> 21:24.680
 both in terms of moving money across borders

21:24.680 --> 21:26.680
 between nations on the continent,

21:26.680 --> 21:31.680
 or the amount of corruption within the current system.

21:33.720 --> 21:37.880
 But the lack of easy ways to pay people

21:39.280 --> 21:42.440
 makes starting anything really difficult.

21:42.440 --> 21:47.120
 I met an entrepreneur who started the Lyft slash Uber

21:47.120 --> 21:49.840
 of Ethiopia, and one of the biggest problems she has

21:49.840 --> 21:54.760
 is that it's not easy for her riders to pay the company,

21:54.760 --> 21:56.800
 it's not easy for her to pay the drivers.

21:57.800 --> 22:00.800
 And that definitely has stunted her growth

22:00.800 --> 22:02.400
 and made everything more challenging.

22:02.400 --> 22:07.160
 So the fact that she even has to think about payments

22:07.160 --> 22:10.280
 instead of thinking about the best rider experience

22:10.280 --> 22:15.080
 and the best driver experience is pretty telling.

22:15.080 --> 22:20.080
 So I think as we get a more durable, resilient

22:20.080 --> 22:25.080
 and global standard, we see a lot more innovation everywhere.

22:26.400 --> 22:29.080
 And I think there's no better case study for this

22:29.080 --> 22:32.080
 than the various countries within Africa

22:32.080 --> 22:35.080
 and their entrepreneurs who are trying to start things

22:35.080 --> 22:38.800
 within health or sustainability or transportation

22:38.800 --> 22:42.520
 or a lot of the companies that we've seen here.

22:42.520 --> 22:47.280
 So the majority of companies I met in November

22:47.280 --> 22:51.280
 when I spent a month on the continent were payments oriented.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.280
 You mentioned, and this is a small tangent,

22:54.280 --> 22:58.320
 you mentioned the anonymous launch of Bitcoin

22:58.320 --> 23:00.720
 is a sort of profound philosophical statement.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.040
 Pseudonymous.

23:02.040 --> 23:03.640
 What's that even mean?

23:03.640 --> 23:04.480
 There's a pseudonym.

23:04.480 --> 23:05.320
 First of all, let me ask.

23:05.320 --> 23:06.480
 There's an identity tied to it.

23:06.480 --> 23:10.080
 It's not just anonymous, it's Nakamoto.

23:10.080 --> 23:13.440
 So Nakamoto might represent one person or multiple people.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.840
 But let me ask, are you Satoshi Nakamoto?

23:15.840 --> 23:17.520
 Just checking, catch you off guard.

23:17.520 --> 23:18.520
 And if I were, would I tell you?

23:18.520 --> 23:19.640
 Yeah, that's true.

23:19.640 --> 23:21.120
 Maybe you slip.

23:21.120 --> 23:25.120
 A pseudonym is constructed identity.

23:25.120 --> 23:28.040
 Anonymity is just kind of this random,

23:28.040 --> 23:32.080
 like drop something off and leave.

23:32.080 --> 23:34.480
 There's no intention to build an identity around it.

23:34.480 --> 23:39.480
 And while the identity being built was a short time window,

23:39.480 --> 23:44.480
 it was meant to stick around, I think, and to be known.

23:44.840 --> 23:49.840
 And it's being honored in how the community

23:50.040 --> 23:50.880
 thinks about building it,

23:50.880 --> 23:54.400
 like the concept of Satoshi's, for instance,

23:55.400 --> 23:56.920
 is one such example.

23:56.920 --> 24:01.400
 But I think it was smart not to do it anonymous,

24:01.400 --> 24:03.760
 not to do it as a real identity,

24:03.760 --> 24:05.120
 but to do it as pseudonym,

24:05.120 --> 24:07.600
 because I think it builds tangibility

24:07.600 --> 24:12.600
 and a little bit of empathy that this was a human

24:13.400 --> 24:14.680
 or a set of humans behind it.

24:14.680 --> 24:19.680
 And there's this natural identity that I can imagine.

24:19.680 --> 24:22.440
 But there is also a sacrifice of ego.

24:22.440 --> 24:23.680
 That's a pretty powerful thing

24:23.680 --> 24:25.360
 from your perspective. Yeah, which is beautiful.

24:25.360 --> 24:28.760
 Would you do, sort of philosophically,

24:28.760 --> 24:29.800
 to ask you the question,

24:29.800 --> 24:32.920
 would you do all the same things you're doing now

24:32.920 --> 24:35.000
 if your name wasn't attached to it?

24:35.000 --> 24:39.320
 Sort of, if you had to sacrifice the ego,

24:39.320 --> 24:41.960
 put another way, is your ego deeply tied

24:41.960 --> 24:43.880
 in the decisions you've been making?

24:44.920 --> 24:45.760
 I hope not.

24:45.760 --> 24:49.240
 I mean, I believe I would certainly attempt

24:49.240 --> 24:51.440
 to do the things without my name having

24:51.440 --> 24:53.400
 to be attached with it.

24:53.400 --> 24:58.400
 But it's hard to do that in a corporation, legally.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.600
 That's the issue.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.200
 If I were to do more open source things,

25:05.200 --> 25:10.200
 then absolutely, I don't need my particular identity,

25:10.680 --> 25:12.600
 my real identity associated with it.

25:12.600 --> 25:17.600
 But I think the appreciation that comes

25:17.640 --> 25:21.000
 from doing something good and being able to see it

25:21.000 --> 25:25.840
 and see people use it is pretty overwhelming and powerful,

25:26.800 --> 25:29.920
 more so than maybe seeing your name in the headlines.

25:29.920 --> 25:33.240
 Let's talk about artificial intelligence a little bit,

25:33.240 --> 25:34.840
 if we could.

25:34.840 --> 25:38.000
 70 years ago, Alan Turing formulated the Turing test.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.240
 To me, natural language is one of the most interesting

25:41.240 --> 25:44.440
 spaces of problems that are tackled

25:44.440 --> 25:45.600
 by artificial intelligence.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.440
 It's the canonical problem of what it means

25:47.440 --> 25:48.520
 to be intelligent.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.720
 He formulated it as the Turing test.

25:50.720 --> 25:53.320
 Let me ask sort of the broad question,

25:53.320 --> 25:56.440
 how hard do you think is it to pass the Turing test

25:56.440 --> 25:58.600
 in the space of language?

25:58.600 --> 26:00.240
 Just from a very practical standpoint,

26:00.240 --> 26:05.240
 I think where we are now and for at least years out

26:07.080 --> 26:11.600
 is one where the artificial intelligence,

26:11.600 --> 26:13.800
 machine learning, the deep learning models

26:13.800 --> 26:17.280
 can bubble up interestingness very, very quickly

26:17.280 --> 26:22.280
 and pair that with human discretion around severity,

26:22.280 --> 26:27.280
 around depth, around nuance and meaning.

26:27.760 --> 26:32.760
 I think for me, the chasm across for general intelligence

26:33.120 --> 26:38.120
 is to be able to explain why and the meaning

26:38.400 --> 26:40.160
 behind something.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.000
 Behind a decision.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.800
 Behind a decision or a set of data.

26:45.800 --> 26:48.720
 So the explainability part is kind of essential

26:48.720 --> 26:52.080
 to be able to explain the meaning behind something.

26:52.080 --> 26:54.320
 To explain using natural language

26:54.320 --> 26:56.600
 why the decisions were made, that kind of thing.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.880
 Yeah, I mean I think that's one of our biggest risks

26:58.880 --> 27:01.240
 in artificial intelligence going forward

27:01.240 --> 27:03.560
 is we are building a lot of black boxes

27:03.560 --> 27:06.840
 that can't necessarily explain why they made a decision

27:06.840 --> 27:09.480
 or what criteria they used to make the decision.

27:09.480 --> 27:11.160
 And we're trusting them more and more

27:11.160 --> 27:14.720
 from lending decisions to content recommendation

27:14.720 --> 27:18.120
 to driving to health.

27:18.120 --> 27:20.880
 Like a lot of us have watches that tell us

27:20.880 --> 27:23.120
 to understand how they're deciding that.

27:23.120 --> 27:25.360
 I mean that one's pretty simple.

27:25.360 --> 27:28.240
 But you can imagine how complex they get.

27:28.240 --> 27:32.080
 And being able to explain the reasoning behind

27:32.080 --> 27:34.960
 some of those recommendations seems to be an essential part.

27:34.960 --> 27:35.800
 Although it's hard.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.840
 Which is a very hard problem because sometimes

27:37.840 --> 27:40.880
 even we can't explain why we make decisions.

27:40.880 --> 27:42.720
 That's what I was, I think we're being sometimes

27:42.720 --> 27:45.720
 a little bit unfair to artificial intelligence systems

27:45.720 --> 27:48.280
 because we're not very good at some of these things.

27:48.280 --> 27:52.600
 So do you think, apologize for the ridiculous

27:52.600 --> 27:55.840
 romanticized question, but on that line of thought,

27:55.840 --> 27:58.840
 do you think we'll ever be able to build a system

28:00.280 --> 28:03.200
 like in the movie Her that you could fall in love with?

28:03.200 --> 28:05.440
 So have that kind of deep connection with.

28:06.360 --> 28:07.440
 Hasn't that already happened?

28:07.440 --> 28:12.020
 Hasn't someone in Japan fallen in love with his AI?

28:13.280 --> 28:14.840
 There's always going to be somebody

28:14.840 --> 28:15.960
 that does that kind of thing.

28:15.960 --> 28:19.280
 I mean at a much larger scale of actually building

28:19.280 --> 28:21.640
 relationships, of being deeper connections.

28:21.640 --> 28:24.120
 It doesn't have to be love, but it's just deeper connections

28:24.120 --> 28:26.560
 with artificial intelligence systems.

28:26.560 --> 28:27.400
 So you mentioned explainability.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.800
 That's less a function of the artificial intelligence

28:29.800 --> 28:32.240
 and more a function of the individual

28:32.240 --> 28:34.680
 and how they find meaning and where they find meaning.

28:34.680 --> 28:37.400
 Do you think we humans can find meaning in technology

28:37.400 --> 28:38.240
 in this kind of way?

28:38.240 --> 28:40.600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, 100%, 100%.

28:40.600 --> 28:43.220
 And I don't necessarily think it's a negative.

28:43.220 --> 28:48.220
 But it's constantly going to evolve.

28:50.180 --> 28:54.460
 So I don't know, but meaning is something

28:54.460 --> 28:56.240
 that's entirely subjective.

28:56.240 --> 28:59.340
 And I don't think it's going to be a function

28:59.340 --> 29:02.380
 of finding the magic algorithm

29:02.380 --> 29:06.340
 that enables everyone to love it.

29:07.420 --> 29:09.100
 But maybe, I don't know.

29:09.100 --> 29:10.820
 That question really gets at the difference

29:10.820 --> 29:12.700
 between human and machine.

29:12.700 --> 29:16.220
 So you had a little bit of an exchange with Elon Musk.

29:17.340 --> 29:20.140
 Basically, I mean it's a trivial version of that,

29:20.140 --> 29:22.060
 but I think there's a more fundamental question

29:22.060 --> 29:24.220
 of is it possible to tell the difference

29:24.220 --> 29:27.260
 between a bot and a human?

29:27.260 --> 29:31.420
 And do you think it's, if we look into the future,

29:31.420 --> 29:34.060
 10, 20 years out, do you think it would be possible

29:34.060 --> 29:36.340
 or is it even necessary to tell the difference

29:36.340 --> 29:40.380
 in the digital space between a human and a robot?

29:40.380 --> 29:42.700
 Can we have fulfilling relationships with each

29:42.700 --> 29:45.260
 or do we need to tell the difference between them?

29:46.200 --> 29:49.340
 I think it's certainly useful in certain problem domains

29:49.340 --> 29:51.040
 to be able to tell the difference.

29:52.460 --> 29:56.500
 I think in others it might not be as useful.

29:56.500 --> 29:58.180
 Do you think it's possible for us today

29:58.180 --> 30:00.020
 to tell that difference?

30:00.020 --> 30:02.860
 Is the reverse the meta of the Turing test?

30:02.860 --> 30:07.060
 Well, what's interesting is I think the technology

30:07.060 --> 30:10.660
 to create is moving much faster

30:10.660 --> 30:13.500
 than the technology to detect, generally.

30:13.500 --> 30:14.340
 You think so?

30:14.340 --> 30:17.220
 So if you look at adversarial machine learning,

30:17.220 --> 30:18.660
 there's a lot of systems that try

30:18.660 --> 30:21.220
 to fool machine learning systems.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.940
 And at least for me, the hope is that the technology

30:23.940 --> 30:28.940
 to defend will always be right there, at least.

30:28.940 --> 30:30.900
 Your sense is that...

30:30.900 --> 30:31.980
 I don't know if they'll be right there.

30:31.980 --> 30:34.140
 I mean, it's a race, right?

30:34.140 --> 30:38.340
 So the detection technologies have to be two

30:38.340 --> 30:42.100
 or 10 steps ahead of the creation technologies.

30:42.100 --> 30:44.180
 This is a problem that I think the financial industry

30:44.180 --> 30:48.460
 will face more and more because a lot of our risk models,

30:48.460 --> 30:50.780
 for instance, are built around identity.

30:50.780 --> 30:53.420
 Payments ultimately comes down to identity.

30:53.420 --> 30:57.620
 And you can imagine a world where all this conversation

30:57.620 --> 31:00.940
 around deep fakes goes towards the direction

31:00.940 --> 31:05.940
 of a driver's license or passports or state identities.

31:06.380 --> 31:09.260
 And people construct identities in order

31:09.260 --> 31:11.900
 to get through a system such as ours

31:11.900 --> 31:15.060
 to start accepting credit cards or into the cash app.

31:15.940 --> 31:19.700
 And those technologies seem to be moving very, very quickly.

31:19.700 --> 31:22.820
 Our ability to detect them, I think,

31:22.820 --> 31:25.060
 is probably lagging at this point,

31:25.060 --> 31:29.820
 but certainly with more focus, we can get ahead of it.

31:29.820 --> 31:33.980
 But this is gonna touch everything.

31:33.980 --> 31:38.500
 So I think it's like security.

31:38.500 --> 31:39.780
 We're never going to be able

31:39.780 --> 31:42.940
 to build a perfect detection system.

31:42.940 --> 31:45.620
 We're only going to be able to...

31:45.620 --> 31:50.540
 What we should be focused on is the speed of evolving it

31:50.540 --> 31:55.540
 and being able to take signals that show correctness

31:55.540 --> 31:58.260
 or errors as quickly as possible

31:58.260 --> 32:01.500
 and move and to be able to build that

32:01.500 --> 32:04.940
 into our newer models or the self learning models.

32:04.940 --> 32:06.020
 Do you have other worries?

32:06.020 --> 32:07.900
 Like some people, like Elon and others,

32:07.900 --> 32:10.340
 have worries of existential threats

32:10.340 --> 32:11.620
 of artificial intelligence,

32:11.620 --> 32:13.700
 of artificial general intelligence?

32:13.700 --> 32:17.060
 Or if you think more narrowly about threats

32:17.060 --> 32:20.300
 and concerns about more narrow artificial intelligence,

32:20.300 --> 32:23.780
 like what are your thoughts in this domain?

32:23.780 --> 32:26.580
 Do you have concerns or are you more optimistic?

32:26.580 --> 32:29.100
 I think Yuval in his book,

32:29.100 --> 32:31.980
 21 Lessons for the 21st Century,

32:31.980 --> 32:34.940
 his last chapter is around meditation.

32:34.940 --> 32:37.140
 And you look at the title of the chapter

32:37.140 --> 32:39.700
 and you're like, oh, it's all meditation.

32:39.700 --> 32:42.660
 But what was interesting about that chapter

32:42.660 --> 32:47.660
 is he believes that kids being born today,

32:48.740 --> 32:53.740
 growing up today, Google has a stronger sense

32:53.740 --> 32:56.300
 of their preferences than they do,

32:57.300 --> 32:59.260
 which you can easily imagine.

32:59.260 --> 33:04.260
 I can easily imagine today that Google probably knows

33:04.420 --> 33:07.300
 my preferences more than my mother does.

33:08.300 --> 33:12.500
 Maybe not me per se, but for someone growing up

33:12.500 --> 33:13.340
 only knowing the internet,

33:13.340 --> 33:16.500
 only knowing what Google is capable of,

33:16.500 --> 33:20.060
 or Facebook or Twitter or Square or any of these things,

33:20.060 --> 33:25.060
 the self awareness is being offloaded to other systems

33:25.580 --> 33:28.180
 and particularly these algorithms.

33:28.180 --> 33:32.220
 And his concern is that we lose that self awareness

33:32.220 --> 33:35.220
 because the self awareness is now outside of us

33:35.220 --> 33:37.060
 and it's doing such a better job

33:37.060 --> 33:41.380
 at helping us direct our decisions around,

33:41.380 --> 33:43.700
 should I stand, should I walk today?

33:43.700 --> 33:45.300
 What doctor should I choose?

33:45.300 --> 33:46.620
 Who should I date?

33:46.620 --> 33:50.420
 All these things we're now seeing play out very quickly.

33:50.420 --> 33:54.780
 So he sees meditation as a tool to build that self awareness

33:54.780 --> 33:56.860
 and to bring the focus back on,

33:56.860 --> 33:58.500
 why do I make these decisions?

33:58.500 --> 34:00.100
 Why do I react in this way?

34:00.100 --> 34:02.740
 Why did I have this thought?

34:02.740 --> 34:04.140
 Where did that come from?

34:04.140 --> 34:05.740
 That's a way to regain control.

34:07.140 --> 34:10.140
 Or awareness, maybe not control, but awareness

34:10.140 --> 34:13.300
 so that you can be aware that yes, I am,

34:13.300 --> 34:15.500
 I am, I am, I am, I am.

34:15.500 --> 34:19.780
 Yes, I am offloading this decision to this algorithm

34:19.780 --> 34:21.660
 that I don't fully understand

34:21.660 --> 34:24.580
 and can't tell me why it's doing the things it's doing

34:24.580 --> 34:26.740
 because it's so complex.

34:26.740 --> 34:29.060
 That's not to say that the algorithm can't be a good thing.

34:29.060 --> 34:31.340
 And to me recommender systems,

34:31.340 --> 34:34.940
 the best of what they can do is to help guide you

34:34.940 --> 34:39.700
 on a journey of learning new ideas of learning period.

34:39.700 --> 34:41.860
 It can be a great thing, but do you know you're doing that?

34:41.860 --> 34:45.540
 Are you aware that you're inviting it to do that to you?

34:45.540 --> 34:48.540
 I think that's the risk he identifies, right?

34:50.100 --> 34:51.700
 That's perfectly okay.

34:51.700 --> 34:55.700
 But are you aware that you have that invitation

34:55.700 --> 34:58.460
 and it's being acted upon?

34:58.460 --> 35:02.460
 And so that's a concern you're kind of highlighting

35:02.460 --> 35:04.660
 that without a lack of awareness,

35:04.660 --> 35:06.300
 you can just be like floating at sea.

35:06.300 --> 35:08.900
 So awareness is key in the future

35:08.900 --> 35:10.860
 of these artificial intelligence systems.

35:10.860 --> 35:12.460
 Yeah, the movie WALLY.

35:12.460 --> 35:13.300
 WALLY.

35:13.300 --> 35:15.340
 Which I think is one of Pixar's best movies

35:15.340 --> 35:17.100
 besides RATATOUILLI.

35:19.340 --> 35:20.660
 RATATOUILLI was incredible.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.220
 You had me until RATATOUILLI, okay.

35:22.220 --> 35:23.620
 RATATOUILLI was incredible.

35:26.180 --> 35:28.140
 All right, we've come to the first point

35:28.140 --> 35:29.140
 where we disagree, okay.

35:29.140 --> 35:31.940
 It's the entrepreneurial story in the form of a rat.

35:35.780 --> 35:38.660
 I just remember just the soundtrack was really good, so.

35:38.660 --> 35:41.020
 Excellent.

35:41.020 --> 35:43.780
 What are your thoughts, sticking on artificial intelligence

35:43.780 --> 35:45.980
 a little bit, about the displacement of jobs?

35:45.980 --> 35:48.220
 That's another perspective that candidates

35:48.220 --> 35:50.180
 like Andrew Yang talk about.

35:50.180 --> 35:51.220
 Yang gang forever.

35:53.100 --> 35:54.100
 Yang gang.

35:54.100 --> 35:56.300
 So he unfortunately, speaking of Yang gang,

35:56.300 --> 35:57.580
 has recently dropped out.

35:57.580 --> 36:00.180
 I know, it was very disappointing and depressing.

36:00.180 --> 36:02.180
 Yeah, but on the positive side,

36:02.180 --> 36:05.300
 he's I think launching a podcast, so.

36:05.300 --> 36:06.180
 Really, cool.

36:06.180 --> 36:07.940
 Yeah, he just announced that.

36:07.940 --> 36:09.900
 I'm sure he'll try to talk you into trying

36:09.900 --> 36:11.060
 to come on to the podcast.

36:11.060 --> 36:12.060
 I will talk to him.

36:12.060 --> 36:13.260
 So. About RATATOUILLI.

36:14.580 --> 36:16.100
 Yeah, maybe he'll be more welcoming

36:16.100 --> 36:18.220
 of the RATATOUILLI argument.

36:18.220 --> 36:20.260
 What are your thoughts on his concerns

36:20.260 --> 36:22.180
 of the displacement of jobs, of automations,

36:22.180 --> 36:24.940
 of the, of course there's positive impacts

36:24.940 --> 36:26.660
 that could come from automation and AI,

36:26.660 --> 36:29.300
 but there could also be negative impacts.

36:29.300 --> 36:31.500
 And within that framework, what are your thoughts

36:31.500 --> 36:33.420
 about universal basic income?

36:33.420 --> 36:36.020
 So these interesting new ideas

36:36.020 --> 36:39.340
 of how we can empower people in the economy.

36:40.380 --> 36:45.380
 I think he was 100% right on almost every dimension.

36:46.660 --> 36:48.660
 We see this in Square's business.

36:48.660 --> 36:52.180
 I mean, he identified truck drivers.

36:52.180 --> 36:53.100
 I'm from Missouri.

36:54.180 --> 36:59.180
 And he certainly pointed to the concern

37:00.540 --> 37:04.340
 and the issue that people from where I'm from

37:04.340 --> 37:07.700
 feel every single day that is often invisible

37:07.700 --> 37:09.500
 and not talked about enough.

37:09.500 --> 37:12.020
 You know, the next big one is cashiers.

37:12.020 --> 37:14.380
 This is where it pertains to Square's business.

37:15.700 --> 37:19.740
 We are seeing more and more of the point of sale

37:19.740 --> 37:22.940
 move to the individual customer's hand

37:22.940 --> 37:24.500
 in the form of their phone and apps

37:24.500 --> 37:27.260
 and preorder and order ahead.

37:27.260 --> 37:29.620
 We're seeing more kiosks.

37:29.620 --> 37:32.300
 We're seeing more things like Amazon Go.

37:32.300 --> 37:37.300
 And the number of workers as a cashier in retail is immense.

37:40.340 --> 37:43.620
 And, you know, there's no real answers

37:43.620 --> 37:47.940
 on how they transform their skills

37:47.940 --> 37:51.140
 and work into something else.

37:51.140 --> 37:53.100
 And I think that does lead to a lot

37:53.100 --> 37:56.140
 of really negative ramifications.

37:56.140 --> 37:59.020
 And the important point that he brought up

37:59.020 --> 38:01.460
 around universal basic income

38:01.460 --> 38:03.540
 is given that the shift is going to come

38:04.900 --> 38:07.540
 and given it is going to take time

38:07.540 --> 38:12.540
 to set people up with new skills and new careers,

38:14.860 --> 38:17.700
 they need to have a floor to be able to survive.

38:17.700 --> 38:22.620
 And this $1,000 a month is such a floor.

38:22.620 --> 38:25.100
 It's not going to incentivize you to quit your job

38:25.100 --> 38:26.620
 because it's not enough,

38:26.620 --> 38:30.220
 but it will enable you to not have to worry

38:30.220 --> 38:35.220
 as much about just getting on day to day

38:35.860 --> 38:39.860
 so that you can focus on what am I going to do now

38:39.860 --> 38:44.860
 and what am I going to, what skills do I need to acquire?

38:44.860 --> 38:48.740
 And I think, you know, a lot of people point

38:48.740 --> 38:53.260
 to the fact that, you know, during the industrial age,

38:53.260 --> 38:55.780
 we had the same concerns around automation,

38:55.780 --> 38:59.220
 factory lines and everything worked out okay.

38:59.220 --> 39:04.220
 But the biggest change is just the velocity

39:04.340 --> 39:08.060
 and the centralization of a lot of the things

39:08.060 --> 39:10.900
 that make this work, which is the data

39:11.820 --> 39:14.900
 and the algorithms that work on this data.

39:14.900 --> 39:18.900
 I think that the second biggest scary thing

39:18.900 --> 39:23.900
 is just how around AI is just who actually owns the data

39:24.820 --> 39:26.300
 and who can operate on it.

39:26.300 --> 39:31.300
 And are we able to share the insights from the data

39:32.940 --> 39:36.380
 so that we can also build algorithms that help our needs

39:36.380 --> 39:39.140
 or help our business or whatnot?

39:39.140 --> 39:43.500
 So that's where I think regulation could play

39:43.500 --> 39:45.300
 a strong and positive part.

39:46.540 --> 39:50.460
 First, looking at the primitives of AI

39:50.460 --> 39:52.660
 and the tools we use to build these services

39:52.660 --> 39:54.820
 that will ultimately touch every single aspect

39:54.820 --> 39:56.540
 of the human experience.

39:56.540 --> 40:01.540
 And then where data is owned and how it's shared.

40:05.980 --> 40:10.540
 So those are the answers that as a society, as a world,

40:10.540 --> 40:12.460
 we need to have better answers around,

40:12.460 --> 40:13.860
 which we're currently not.

40:13.860 --> 40:15.380
 They're just way too centralized

40:15.380 --> 40:18.100
 into a few very, very large companies.

40:19.580 --> 40:23.260
 But I think it was spot on with identifying the problem

40:23.260 --> 40:25.860
 and proposing solutions that would actually work.

40:26.780 --> 40:29.300
 At least that we learned from that you could expand

40:29.300 --> 40:34.300
 or evolve, but I mean, I think UBI is well past its due.

40:38.380 --> 40:41.620
 I mean, it was certainly trumpeted by Martin Luther King

40:41.620 --> 40:43.820
 and even before him as well.

40:44.820 --> 40:48.060
 And like you said, the exact $1,000 mark

40:48.060 --> 40:50.260
 might not be the correct one,

40:50.260 --> 40:54.020
 but you should take the steps to try to implement

40:54.020 --> 40:56.260
 these solutions and see what works.

40:56.260 --> 40:57.500
 100%.

40:57.500 --> 40:59.380
 So I think you and I eat similar diets,

40:59.380 --> 41:01.740
 and at least I was.

41:01.740 --> 41:04.180
 The first time I've heard this.

41:04.180 --> 41:05.380
 Yeah, so I was doing it before.

41:05.380 --> 41:08.620
 First time anyone has said that to me, in this case anyway.

41:08.620 --> 41:11.040
 Yeah, but it's becoming more and more cool.

41:12.140 --> 41:13.700
 But I was doing it before it was cool.

41:13.700 --> 41:16.300
 So intermittent fasting and fasting in general,

41:16.300 --> 41:18.700
 I really enjoy, I love food,

41:18.700 --> 41:23.060
 but I enjoy the, I also love suffering because I'm Russian.

41:23.060 --> 41:26.100
 So fasting kind of makes you appreciate the,

41:29.580 --> 41:32.420
 makes you appreciate what it is to be human somehow.

41:33.540 --> 41:36.660
 But I have, outside the philosophical stuff,

41:36.660 --> 41:37.900
 I have a more specific question.

41:37.900 --> 41:41.980
 It also helps me as a programmer and a deep thinker,

41:41.980 --> 41:43.940
 like from the scientific perspective,

41:43.940 --> 41:46.900
 to sit there for many hours and focus deeply.

41:46.900 --> 41:50.900
 Maybe you were a hacker before you were CEO.

41:50.900 --> 41:55.020
 What have you learned about diet, lifestyle,

41:55.020 --> 41:57.940
 mindset that helps you maximize mental performance,

41:57.940 --> 42:00.220
 to be able to focus for,

42:00.220 --> 42:03.980
 to think deeply in this world of distractions?

42:03.980 --> 42:07.220
 I think I just took it for granted for too long.

42:08.380 --> 42:09.660
 Which aspect?

42:09.660 --> 42:13.460
 Just the social structure of we eat three meals a day

42:13.460 --> 42:15.140
 and there's snacks in between.

42:15.140 --> 42:18.980
 And I just never really asked the question, why?

42:18.980 --> 42:20.780
 Oh, by the way, in case people don't know,

42:20.780 --> 42:22.100
 I think a lot of people know,

42:22.100 --> 42:26.100
 but you at least, you famously eat once a day.

42:26.100 --> 42:27.620
 You still eat once a day?

42:27.620 --> 42:29.620
 Yep, I eat dinner.

42:29.620 --> 42:32.060
 By the way, what made you decide to eat once a day?

42:32.060 --> 42:33.980
 Like, cause to me that was a huge revolution

42:33.980 --> 42:35.420
 that you don't have to eat breakfast.

42:35.420 --> 42:37.380
 That was like, I felt like I was a rebel.

42:37.380 --> 42:39.900
 Like I abandoned my parents or something

42:39.900 --> 42:41.100
 and became an anarchist.

42:41.100 --> 42:43.500
 When you first, like the first week you start doing it,

42:43.500 --> 42:45.860
 it feels that you kind of like have a superpower.

42:45.860 --> 42:47.660
 Then you realize it's not really a superpower.

42:47.660 --> 42:50.100
 But it, I think you realize,

42:50.100 --> 42:53.060
 at least I realized like it just how much is,

42:53.060 --> 42:58.060
 how much our mind dictates what we're possible of.

42:59.780 --> 43:02.260
 And sometimes we have structures around us

43:02.260 --> 43:05.340
 that incentivize like, this three meal a day thing,

43:05.340 --> 43:09.700
 which was purely social structure

43:09.700 --> 43:14.180
 versus necessity for our health and for our bodies.

43:14.180 --> 43:17.500
 And I did it just, I started doing it

43:17.500 --> 43:21.540
 because I played a lot with my diet when I was a kid

43:21.540 --> 43:23.340
 and I was vegan for two years

43:23.340 --> 43:28.260
 and just went all over the place just because I,

43:28.260 --> 43:31.180
 you know, health is the most precious thing we have

43:31.180 --> 43:33.900
 and none of us really understand it.

43:33.900 --> 43:37.980
 So being able to ask the question through experiments

43:37.980 --> 43:39.460
 that I can perform on myself

43:39.460 --> 43:44.140
 and learn about is compelling to me.

43:44.140 --> 43:47.580
 And I heard this one guy on a podcast, Wim Hof,

43:47.580 --> 43:50.900
 who's famous for doing ice baths and holding his breath

43:50.900 --> 43:53.540
 and all these things.

43:54.660 --> 43:56.580
 He said he only eats one meal a day.

43:56.580 --> 43:59.180
 I'm like, wow, that sounds super challenging

43:59.180 --> 44:00.700
 and uncomfortable.

44:00.700 --> 44:02.020
 I'm gonna do it.

44:02.020 --> 44:05.380
 So I just, I learn the most when I make myself,

44:06.260 --> 44:07.460
 I wouldn't say suffer,

44:07.460 --> 44:10.420
 but when I make myself feel uncomfortable

44:10.420 --> 44:14.140
 because everything comes to bear in those moments

44:14.140 --> 44:19.140
 and you really learn what you're about or what you're not.

44:21.020 --> 44:23.940
 So I've been doing that my whole life.

44:23.940 --> 44:25.780
 Like when I was a kid, I could not,

44:25.780 --> 44:27.620
 like I was, I could not speak.

44:27.620 --> 44:29.140
 Like I had to go to a speech therapist

44:29.140 --> 44:31.940
 and it made me extremely shy.

44:31.940 --> 44:34.860
 And then one day I realized I can't keep doing this

44:34.860 --> 44:39.740
 and I signed up for the speech club.

44:39.740 --> 44:44.740
 And it was the most uncomfortable thing

44:45.060 --> 44:49.540
 I could imagine doing, getting a topic on a note card,

44:49.540 --> 44:51.500
 having five minutes to write a speech

44:51.500 --> 44:53.580
 about whatever that topic is,

44:53.580 --> 44:56.620
 not being able to use the note card while speaking

44:56.620 --> 44:59.420
 and speaking for five minutes about that topic.

44:59.420 --> 45:03.940
 So, but it just, it puts so much,

45:03.940 --> 45:06.220
 it gave me so much perspective

45:06.220 --> 45:08.500
 around the power of communication,

45:08.500 --> 45:10.020
 around my own deficiencies

45:10.020 --> 45:14.140
 and around if I set my mind to do something, I'll do it.

45:14.140 --> 45:16.420
 So it gave me a lot more confidence.

45:16.420 --> 45:18.900
 So I see fasting in the same light.

45:18.900 --> 45:21.460
 This is something that was interesting,

45:21.460 --> 45:23.860
 challenging, uncomfortable,

45:23.860 --> 45:28.860
 and has given me so much learning and benefit as a result.

45:30.220 --> 45:32.620
 And it will lead to other things that I'll experiment with

45:32.620 --> 45:35.820
 and play with, but yeah,

45:35.820 --> 45:38.780
 it does feel a little bit like a superpower sometimes.

45:39.820 --> 45:42.700
 The most boring superpower one can imagine.

45:42.700 --> 45:44.060
 Now it's quite incredible.

45:44.060 --> 45:46.820
 The clarity of mind is pretty interesting.

45:47.660 --> 45:49.700
 Speaking of suffering,

45:49.700 --> 45:53.060
 you kind of talk about facing difficult ideas.

45:53.060 --> 45:58.060
 You meditate, you think about the broad context of life,

45:58.940 --> 46:00.300
 of our societies.

46:00.300 --> 46:02.500
 Let me ask, sort of apologize again

46:02.500 --> 46:03.700
 for the romanticized question,

46:03.700 --> 46:06.500
 but do you ponder your own mortality?

46:06.500 --> 46:09.940
 Do you think about death,

46:09.940 --> 46:13.780
 about the finiteness of human existence

46:13.780 --> 46:15.420
 when you meditate, when you think about it?

46:15.420 --> 46:18.020
 And if you do, what,

46:18.020 --> 46:20.540
 how do you make sense of it, that this thing ends?

46:22.460 --> 46:23.740
 Well, I don't try to make sense of it.

46:23.740 --> 46:25.500
 I do think about it every day.

46:25.500 --> 46:29.060
 I mean, it's a daily, multiple times a day.

46:29.060 --> 46:30.540
 Are you afraid of death?

46:30.540 --> 46:32.380
 No, I'm not afraid of it.

46:32.380 --> 46:36.300
 I think it's a transformation, I don't know to what,

46:36.300 --> 46:38.180
 but it's also a tool

46:39.260 --> 46:44.260
 to feel the importance of every moment.

46:44.620 --> 46:48.620
 So I just use it as a reminder, like I have an hour.

46:48.620 --> 46:51.380
 Is this really what I'm going to spend the hour doing?

46:52.300 --> 46:55.460
 Like I only have so many more sunsets and sunrises to watch.

46:55.460 --> 46:58.300
 Like I'm not going to get up for it.

46:58.300 --> 47:02.060
 I'm not going to make sure that I try to see it.

47:02.060 --> 47:06.660
 So it just puts a lot into perspective

47:06.660 --> 47:09.060
 and it helps me prioritize.

47:09.060 --> 47:12.500
 I think it's, I don't see it as something that's like

47:13.780 --> 47:15.500
 that I dread or is dreadful.

47:15.500 --> 47:18.060
 It's a tool that is available

47:18.060 --> 47:19.660
 to every single person to use every day

47:19.660 --> 47:21.780
 because it shows how precious life is.

47:21.780 --> 47:24.540
 And there's reminders every single day,

47:24.540 --> 47:27.940
 whether it be your own health or a friend or a coworker

47:27.940 --> 47:29.620
 or something you see in the news.

47:30.620 --> 47:32.380
 So to me it's just a question

47:32.380 --> 47:34.820
 of what we do with our daily reminder.

47:34.820 --> 47:39.820
 And for me, it's am I really focused on what matters?

47:40.180 --> 47:42.220
 And sometimes that might be work,

47:42.220 --> 47:45.180
 sometimes that might be friendships or family

47:45.180 --> 47:47.020
 or relationships or whatnot,

47:47.020 --> 47:51.300
 but it's the ultimate clarifier in that sense.

47:51.300 --> 47:53.620
 So on the question of what matters,

47:53.620 --> 47:57.060
 another ridiculously big question of

47:57.060 --> 47:58.460
 once you try to make sense of it,

47:58.460 --> 48:00.700
 what do you think is the meaning of it all,

48:00.700 --> 48:02.020
 the meaning of life?

48:02.020 --> 48:07.020
 What gives you purpose, happiness, meaning?

48:07.660 --> 48:08.500
 A lot does.

48:08.500 --> 48:11.500
 I mean, just being able to be aware

48:14.340 --> 48:18.580
 of the fact that I'm alive is pretty meaningful.

48:20.060 --> 48:23.060
 The connections I feel with individuals,

48:23.060 --> 48:25.060
 whether they're people I just meet

48:25.060 --> 48:29.940
 or long lasting friendships or my family is meaningful.

48:30.900 --> 48:33.740
 Seeing people use something that I helped build

48:33.740 --> 48:36.300
 is really meaningful and powerful to me.

48:38.820 --> 48:40.300
 But that sense of, I mean,

48:40.300 --> 48:43.460
 I think ultimately it comes down to a sense of connection

48:43.460 --> 48:47.220
 and just feeling like I am bigger,

48:47.220 --> 48:49.940
 I am part of something that's bigger than myself

48:49.940 --> 48:52.180
 and like I can feel it directly

48:52.180 --> 48:54.020
 in small ways or large ways,

48:54.020 --> 48:58.260
 however it manifests is probably it.

48:59.700 --> 49:00.700
 Last question.

49:00.700 --> 49:02.860
 Do you think we're living in a simulation?

49:05.900 --> 49:06.740
 I don't know.

49:06.740 --> 49:08.100
 It's a pretty fun one if we are,

49:09.060 --> 49:14.020
 but also crazy and random and wrought with tons of problems.

49:15.580 --> 49:17.260
 But yeah.

49:17.260 --> 49:19.420
 Would you have it any other way?

49:19.420 --> 49:20.260
 Yeah.

49:20.260 --> 49:24.580
 I mean, I just think it's taken us way too long

49:24.580 --> 49:27.180
 as a planet to realize we're all in this together

49:27.180 --> 49:32.180
 and we all are connected in very significant ways.

49:34.100 --> 49:38.940
 I think we hide our connectivity very well through ego,

49:38.940 --> 49:42.060
 through whatever it is of the day.

49:42.060 --> 49:46.260
 But that is the one thing I would wanna work

49:46.260 --> 49:51.260
 towards changing and that's how I would have it another way.

49:51.540 --> 49:52.900
 Cause if we can't do that,

49:52.900 --> 49:55.620
 then how are we gonna connect to all the other simulations?

49:55.620 --> 49:57.380
 Cause that's the next step is like

49:57.380 --> 49:58.860
 what's happening in the other simulation.

49:58.860 --> 50:01.140
 Escaping this one and yeah.

50:03.380 --> 50:05.500
 Spanning across the multiple simulations

50:05.500 --> 50:07.380
 and sharing in and on the fun.

50:07.380 --> 50:09.940
 I don't think there's a better way to end it.

50:09.940 --> 50:12.060
 Jack, thank you so much for all the work you do.

50:12.060 --> 50:13.940
 There's probably other ways that we've ended this

50:13.940 --> 50:16.620
 and other simulations that may have been better.

50:16.620 --> 50:18.740
 We'll have to wait and see.

50:18.740 --> 50:19.900
 Thanks so much for talking today.

50:19.900 --> 50:20.740
 Thank you.

50:21.620 --> 50:24.180

 And now let me leave you with some words

50:47.180 --> 50:49.580
 about Bitcoin from Paul Graham.

50:50.540 --> 50:52.580
 I'm very intrigued by Bitcoin.

50:52.580 --> 50:55.100
 It has all the signs of a paradigm shift.

50:55.100 --> 50:58.900
 Hackers love it, yet it is described as a toy,

50:58.900 --> 51:01.020
 just like microcomputers.

51:01.020 --> 51:14.020
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
