 The following is a conversation with Jo Bowler,

00:02.720 --> 00:04.840
 a mathematics educator at Stanford

00:04.840 --> 00:08.080
 and co founder of ucubed.org

00:08.080 --> 00:10.080
 that seeks to inspire young minds

00:10.080 --> 00:12.520
 with the beauty of mathematics.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.040

00:17.140 --> 00:19.340
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast

00:19.340 --> 00:22.420
 and here is my conversation with Jo Bowler.

00:23.640 --> 00:27.200
 What to you is beautiful about mathematics?

00:27.200 --> 00:30.400
 I love a mathematics that some people

00:30.400 --> 00:32.720
 don't even think of as mathematics,

00:32.720 --> 00:37.640
 which is beautiful, creative mathematics,

00:37.640 --> 00:39.520
 where we look at maths in different ways,

00:39.520 --> 00:41.240
 we visualize it,

00:41.240 --> 00:44.680
 we think about different solutions to problems.

00:44.680 --> 00:46.120
 A lot of people think of maths

00:46.120 --> 00:49.560
 as you have one method and one answer.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.160
 And what I love about maths

00:51.160 --> 00:54.000
 is the multiple different ways you can see things,

00:54.000 --> 00:56.760
 different methods, different ways of seeing different.

00:56.760 --> 00:59.160
 In some cases, different solutions.

00:59.160 --> 01:02.140
 So that is what is beautiful to me about mathematics,

01:02.140 --> 01:05.800
 that you can see and solve it in many different ways.

01:05.800 --> 01:10.000
 And also the sad part that many people think

01:10.000 --> 01:13.820
 that maths is just one answer and one method.

01:13.820 --> 01:16.340
 So to you, the beauty emerges

01:16.340 --> 01:18.560
 when you have a problem with a solution

01:18.560 --> 01:21.080
 and you start adding other solutions,

01:21.080 --> 01:25.440
 simpler solutions, weirder solutions, more interesting,

01:25.440 --> 01:28.180
 some of their visual, some of their algebraic,

01:28.180 --> 01:30.080
 geometry, all that kind of stuff.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.280
 Yeah, I mean, I always say

01:32.280 --> 01:35.360
 that you can take any maths area and make it visual.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.400
 And we say to teachers,

01:36.400 --> 01:39.880
 give us your most dry, boring maths

01:39.880 --> 01:43.200
 and we'll make it a visual, interesting, creative problem.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.900
 And it turns out you can do that with any area of maths.

01:46.900 --> 01:49.600
 And I think we've given,

01:49.600 --> 01:51.680
 it's been a great disservice to kids and others

01:51.680 --> 01:56.120
 that it's always been numbers, lots and lots of numbers.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.040
 Numbers can be great,

01:57.040 --> 02:01.000
 but you can think about maths in other ways besides numbers.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.040
 Do you find that most people are better visual learners

02:05.040 --> 02:07.520
 or is this just something that's complimentary?

02:08.360 --> 02:11.000
 What's the kind of the full spectrum of students

02:11.000 --> 02:13.360
 in the way they like to explore maths, would you say?

02:13.360 --> 02:17.440
 There's definitely people who come into the classes I do

02:17.440 --> 02:19.720
 who are more interested in visual thinking

02:19.720 --> 02:21.920
 and like visual approaches.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.640
 But it turns out what the neuroscience is telling us

02:24.640 --> 02:26.680
 is that when we think about maths,

02:26.680 --> 02:29.120
 there are two visual pathways in the brain

02:29.120 --> 02:32.720
 and we should all be thinking about it visually.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.400
 Some approaches have been to say,

02:34.400 --> 02:37.360
 well, you're a visual learner, so we'll give you visuals

02:37.360 --> 02:40.580
 and you're not a visual learner.

02:40.580 --> 02:45.080
 But actually, if you think you're not a visual learner,

02:45.080 --> 02:48.840
 it's probably more important that you have a visual approach.

02:48.840 --> 02:51.560
 So you can develop that part of your brain.

02:51.560 --> 02:52.920
 So you were saying that there's some kind

02:52.920 --> 02:54.520
 of interconnected aspect to it.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.680
 So the visual connects with the non visual.

02:56.680 --> 02:59.840
 Yeah, so this is what the neuroscience has shown us

02:59.840 --> 03:01.160
 that when you work on a maths problem,

03:01.160 --> 03:03.480
 there are five different brain pathways

03:03.480 --> 03:06.720
 and that the most high achieving people in the world

03:06.720 --> 03:10.440
 are people who have more connections between these pathways.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.840
 So if you see a maths problem with numbers,

03:13.840 --> 03:15.880
 but you also see it visually,

03:15.880 --> 03:17.980
 that will cause a connection to happen in your brain

03:17.980 --> 03:19.840
 between these pathways.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.080
 And if you maybe write about it with words,

03:22.080 --> 03:23.380
 that would cause another connection

03:23.380 --> 03:26.460
 or maybe you build it with something physical

03:26.460 --> 03:28.360
 that would cause a different connection.

03:28.360 --> 03:31.480
 And what we want for kids is we call it

03:31.480 --> 03:33.640
 a multi dimensional experience of maths,

03:33.640 --> 03:35.480
 seeing it in different ways,

03:35.480 --> 03:37.860
 experiencing it in different ways,

03:37.860 --> 03:40.600
 that will cause that great connected brain.

03:40.600 --> 03:43.300
 You know, there's these stories of physicists doing the same.

03:43.300 --> 03:45.000
 I find physicists are often better

03:45.000 --> 03:47.160
 at building that part of their brain

03:47.160 --> 03:50.600
 of using visualization for intuition building,

03:50.600 --> 03:53.020
 because you ultimately want to understand

03:53.920 --> 03:57.040
 the like the deepest secret underneath this problem.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.760
 And for that, you have to intuit your way there.

03:59.760 --> 04:02.720
 And you mentioned offline that one of the ways

04:02.720 --> 04:03.680
 you might approach a problem

04:03.680 --> 04:05.840
 is to try to tell a story about it.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.760
 And some of it is like legend,

04:07.760 --> 04:10.880
 but I'm sure it's not always is, you know,

04:10.880 --> 04:14.880
 you have Einstein thinking about a train,

04:14.880 --> 04:16.680
 you know, and the speed of light

04:16.680 --> 04:20.000
 and you know, that kind of intuition is useful.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.960
 You start to like imagine a physical world,

04:22.960 --> 04:25.480
 like how does this idea manifest itself

04:25.480 --> 04:26.320
 in the physical world?

04:26.320 --> 04:27.560
 And then start playing in your mind

04:27.560 --> 04:29.240
 with that physical world and think,

04:29.240 --> 04:30.200
 is this going to be true?

04:30.200 --> 04:31.480
 Is this going to be true?

04:31.480 --> 04:32.320
 Right.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.800
 Einstein is well known for thinking visually.

04:35.800 --> 04:39.480
 And people talk about how he really didn't want

04:39.480 --> 04:41.520
 to go anywhere with problems

04:41.520 --> 04:43.240
 without thinking about them visually.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.780
 But the other thing you mentioned

04:44.780 --> 04:48.760
 that sparked something for me is thinking with intuition,

04:48.760 --> 04:51.400
 like having intuition about math problems.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.080
 That's another thing that's often absent in math class,

04:54.080 --> 04:55.800
 the idea that you might think about a problem

04:55.800 --> 05:00.760
 and use your intuition, but so important.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.820
 And when mathematicians are interviewed,

05:02.820 --> 05:04.400
 they will very frequently talk about the role

05:04.400 --> 05:07.200
 of intuition in solving problems,

05:07.200 --> 05:12.200
 but not commonly acknowledged or brought into education.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.200
 Yeah, I mean, that's what it is.

05:14.200 --> 05:18.960
 Like if you task yourself with building an intuition

05:18.960 --> 05:23.280
 about a problem, that's where you start to pull in,

05:23.280 --> 05:26.680
 like what is the pattern I'm seeing?

05:26.680 --> 05:28.080
 In order to understand the pattern,

05:28.080 --> 05:31.240
 you might want to then start utilizing visualization.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.600
 But ultimately, that's all in service

05:33.600 --> 05:38.280
 of like solving the puzzle, like cracking it open

05:38.280 --> 05:42.160
 to get the simple explanation of why things are wrong.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.680
 Why things are the way they are,

05:43.680 --> 05:47.560
 as opposed to, like you said, having a particular algorithm

05:47.560 --> 05:50.080
 that you can then execute to solve the problem.

05:50.080 --> 05:51.080
 Yeah, but it's hard.

05:51.080 --> 05:53.480
 It's hard, like reasoning is really hard.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.080
 Yeah, it's hard.

05:55.080 --> 05:58.780
 I mean, I love to value what's hard in maths

05:58.780 --> 06:00.560
 instead of being afraid of it.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.440
 We know that when you struggle,

06:02.440 --> 06:04.480
 that's actually a really good time for your brain.

06:04.480 --> 06:07.200
 You want to be struggling when you're thinking about things.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.000
 So if it's hard to think intuitively about something,

06:10.000 --> 06:13.560
 that's probably a really good time for your brain.

06:13.560 --> 06:16.680
 I used to work with somebody called Sebastian Thrun,

06:16.680 --> 06:19.520
 who is a great sort of mathematician,

06:19.520 --> 06:21.200
 you might think of him, AI person.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.720
 And I remember in one interview I did with him,

06:23.720 --> 06:25.760
 he talked about how they'd built robots,

06:25.760 --> 06:27.560
 I think for the Smithsonian,

06:27.560 --> 06:29.320
 and how they were having this trouble

06:29.320 --> 06:32.300
 with them picking up white noise.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.540
 And he said they had to solve it.

06:34.540 --> 06:36.400
 They had to work out what's going on

06:36.400 --> 06:41.280
 and how he intuitively worked out what the problem was.

06:41.280 --> 06:45.560
 But then it took him three weeks to show it mathematically.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.000
 I thought that was really interesting

06:47.000 --> 06:49.600
 that how you can have this intuition

06:49.600 --> 06:51.760
 and know something works.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.380
 It's kind of different from going through

06:53.380 --> 06:56.980
 that long mathematical process of proving it,

06:56.980 --> 06:58.240
 but so important.

06:58.240 --> 07:01.600
 Yeah, I think probably our brains are evolved

07:01.600 --> 07:03.920
 as like intuition machines

07:03.920 --> 07:08.920
 and the math of like showing it like formally

07:08.920 --> 07:12.120
 is probably an extra thing that we're not designed for.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.960
 You see that with Feynman and his,

07:14.960 --> 07:16.960
 I mean, it just, all of these physicists,

07:16.960 --> 07:21.140
 definitely you see starting with intuition,

07:21.140 --> 07:23.400
 sometimes starting with an experiment

07:24.520 --> 07:27.920
 and then the experiment inspires intuition.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.320
 But you can think of an experiment

07:29.320 --> 07:31.080
 as a kind of visualization.

07:31.080 --> 07:34.320
 Just like let's take whatever the heck we're looking at

07:34.320 --> 07:38.680
 and draw it and draw like the pattern as it evolves,

07:38.680 --> 07:41.120
 as the thing grows for N equals one,

07:41.120 --> 07:42.880
 for N equals two, N equals three,

07:42.880 --> 07:44.800
 you start to play with it.

07:44.800 --> 07:49.440
 And then in the modern day, which I loved doing is,

07:49.440 --> 07:52.480
 you can write a program that then visualizes it for you.

07:52.480 --> 07:55.520
 And then you can start exploring it programmatically.

07:55.520 --> 08:00.160
 And then you can do so interactively too.

08:00.160 --> 08:03.600
 I tend to not like interactive

08:03.600 --> 08:05.680
 because it takes way too much work

08:05.680 --> 08:07.160
 because you have to click and move and stuff.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.880
 I love to interact through writing programs,

08:09.880 --> 08:12.480
 but that's my particular brain, software engineer.

08:12.480 --> 08:16.960
 So like you can do all these kinds of visualizations

08:16.960 --> 08:19.320
 and then there's the tools of visualization,

08:19.320 --> 08:22.640
 like color, all of those kinds of things

08:22.640 --> 08:24.240
 that you're absolutely right.

08:24.240 --> 08:27.200
 They're actually not taught very much.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.800
 Like the art of visualization.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.040
 Not taught.

08:30.040 --> 08:33.720
 And we love as well color coding.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.480
 Like when you represent something mathematically,

08:36.480 --> 08:41.040
 you can show color to show the growth and kind of code that.

08:41.040 --> 08:44.280
 So if I have an algebraic expression for a pattern,

08:44.280 --> 08:46.720
 maybe I show the X with a certain color,

08:46.720 --> 08:48.000
 but also write in that color

08:48.000 --> 08:51.360
 so you can see the relationship.

08:51.360 --> 08:52.320
 Very cool.

08:52.320 --> 08:54.920
 And yeah, particularly in our work

08:54.920 --> 08:56.800
 with elementary teachers,

08:56.800 --> 08:58.720
 many of them come to our workshops

08:58.720 --> 09:00.720
 and they're literally in tears

09:00.720 --> 09:03.840
 when they see things making sense visually

09:03.840 --> 09:06.280
 because they've spent their whole lives

09:06.280 --> 09:09.200
 not realizing you can really understand things

09:09.200 --> 09:10.920
 with these visuals.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.680
 It's quite powerful.

09:12.680 --> 09:17.680
 You say that there's something valuable to learning

09:17.800 --> 09:20.480
 when the thing that you're doing is challenging,

09:20.480 --> 09:21.600
 is difficult.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.000
 So a lot of people say math is hard

09:24.000 --> 09:28.040
 or math is too hard or too hard for me.

09:28.040 --> 09:32.360
 Do you think math should be easy or should it be hard?

09:33.440 --> 09:36.920
 I think it's great when things are challenging,

09:36.920 --> 09:39.160
 but there's something that's really key

09:39.160 --> 09:42.880
 to being able to deal with challenging maths

09:42.880 --> 09:46.800
 and that is knowing that you can do it.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.680
 And I think the problem in education

09:48.680 --> 09:51.200
 is a lot of people have got this idea

09:51.200 --> 09:54.000
 that you're either born with a maths brain or you're not.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.720
 So when they start to struggle,

09:55.720 --> 09:58.440
 they think, oh, I don't have that maths brain.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.960
 And then they will literally sort of switch off

10:00.960 --> 10:04.080
 in their brain and things will go downhill from that point.

10:04.080 --> 10:06.240
 So struggle becomes a lot easier

10:06.240 --> 10:10.960
 and you're able to struggle if you don't have that idea,

10:10.960 --> 10:13.400
 but you know that you can do it.

10:13.400 --> 10:16.000
 You have to go through this struggle to get there,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.720
 but you're able to do that.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.760
 And so we're hampered in being able to struggle

10:21.760 --> 10:25.240
 with these ideas we've been given about what we can do.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.920
 Can I ask a difficult question here?

10:26.920 --> 10:27.760
 Yeah.

10:27.760 --> 10:31.960
 So there's kind of, I don't know what the right term is,

10:31.960 --> 10:36.960
 but some people struggle with learning in different ways,

10:38.640 --> 10:42.400
 like their brain is constructed in different ways.

10:42.400 --> 10:47.000
 And how much should, as educators,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.280
 should we make room for that?

10:49.280 --> 10:52.360
 So how do you know the difference between this is hard

10:52.360 --> 10:54.440
 and I don't like doing hard things

10:54.440 --> 10:57.040
 versus my brain is wired in a way

10:57.040 --> 10:59.040
 where I need to learn in very different ways.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.640
 I can't learn it this way.

11:00.640 --> 11:02.320
 How do you find that line?

11:02.320 --> 11:04.040
 How do you operate in that gray area?

11:04.040 --> 11:07.360
 So this is why being a teacher is so hard

11:07.360 --> 11:09.360
 and people really don't appreciate

11:09.360 --> 11:12.280
 how difficult teaching is when you're faced with,

11:12.280 --> 11:14.920
 I don't know, 30 students who think in different ways.

11:14.920 --> 11:19.480
 So, but this is also why I believe it's so important

11:19.480 --> 11:21.960
 to have this multi dimensional approach to maths.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.680
 We've really offered it in one way,

11:24.680 --> 11:27.360
 which is here's some numbers in a method.

11:27.360 --> 11:31.200
 You follow me, do what I just did and then reproduce it.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.840
 And so there are some kids who like doing that

11:33.840 --> 11:34.880
 and they do well.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.680
 And a lot of kids who don't like doing it

11:37.680 --> 11:39.120
 and don't do well.

11:39.120 --> 11:42.760
 But when you open up maths and you give,

11:42.760 --> 11:44.640
 you let kids experience it in different ways,

11:44.640 --> 11:47.640
 maybe visually with numbers, with words.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.960
 What happens is kids,

11:49.960 --> 11:52.440
 there are many more kids who can access it.

11:52.440 --> 11:56.160
 So those different brain wirings you're talking about,

11:56.160 --> 11:58.840
 where some people are just more able to do something

11:58.840 --> 12:00.240
 in a particular way.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.840
 That's why we want to,

12:01.840 --> 12:04.680
 that's one of the reasons we want to open it up

12:04.680 --> 12:08.360
 so that there are different ways of accessing it.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.160
 And then that's not really a problem.

12:11.160 --> 12:15.960
 So I grew up in the Soviet Union and fell in love

12:15.960 --> 12:17.400
 with math early.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.800
 I was forced into math early

12:19.800 --> 12:22.320
 and fell in love through force.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.160
 That's good.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.400
 Well, good that you fell in love about the force.

12:25.400 --> 12:28.360
 Well, but something we talked about a little bit

12:28.360 --> 12:33.320
 is there is such a value for excellence.

12:33.320 --> 12:37.920
 It's competitive and it's also everybody kind of looks up

12:37.920 --> 12:42.920
 the definition of success is being in a particular class

12:44.440 --> 12:46.320
 is being really good at it.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.680
 And like, it's not improving.

12:49.680 --> 12:50.920
 It's like being really good.

12:50.920 --> 12:53.800
 I mean, we are much more like that with sports, for example.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.880
 We're not, it's like, it's understood,

12:56.880 --> 12:59.760
 you're going to star on the basketball team

12:59.760 --> 13:02.400
 if you're gonna start on the basketball team

13:02.400 --> 13:05.120
 if you're going to be better than the other guys,

13:05.120 --> 13:06.520
 the other girls on the team.

13:06.520 --> 13:11.520
 So that coupled with the belief,

13:12.160 --> 13:14.640
 this could be partially a communist belief, I don't know,

13:14.640 --> 13:19.120
 but the belief that everybody is capable of being great.

13:19.120 --> 13:22.160
 But if you're not great, that's your fault

13:22.160 --> 13:23.400
 and you need to work harder.

13:23.400 --> 13:27.880
 And I remember I had a sense that probably delusional,

13:27.880 --> 13:29.600
 but I could win a Nobel prize.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.360
 I don't even know what that entails.

13:31.360 --> 13:36.360
 But I thought, like my dad early on told me just offhand

13:39.560 --> 13:42.520
 and it always stuck with me that if you can figure out

13:42.520 --> 13:46.120
 how to build a time machine, how to travel back in time,

13:46.120 --> 13:48.360
 it will probably give you a Nobel prize.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.400
 And I remember early in my life thinking

13:50.400 --> 13:52.440
 I'm going to invent the time machine.

13:52.440 --> 13:56.720
 And like the tools of mathematics were in service

13:56.720 --> 14:00.000
 of that dream of winning the Nobel prize.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.480
 It's silly. I didn't really think in those concrete terms,

14:03.480 --> 14:06.760
 but I just thought I could be great at feeling.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.640
 And then when you struggle,

14:08.640 --> 14:11.920
 the belief that you could be great is like,

14:11.920 --> 14:12.960
 struggle is good.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.520
 Right, pushes you on, yeah.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.240
 And so the other thing about the Soviet system

14:17.240 --> 14:20.520
 that I'd love to hear your comments about

14:20.520 --> 14:23.840
 is just the sheer like hours of math.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.600
 Like the number of courses,

14:25.600 --> 14:29.280
 you're talking about a lot of geometry, a lot more geometry.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.640
 I think in the American system,

14:30.640 --> 14:33.080
 you take maybe one year of geometry.

14:33.080 --> 14:33.920
 In high school, yeah.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.240
 In high school.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.480
 First of all, geometry is beautiful, it's visual.

14:37.480 --> 14:39.120
 And then you get to reason through proofs

14:39.120 --> 14:40.160
 and stuff like that.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.600
 In Russia, I remember just being nailed

14:42.600 --> 14:43.840
 over and over with geometry.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.600
 It was just nonstop.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.160
 And then of course there's different perspectives

14:48.160 --> 14:50.320
 on calculus and just the whole,

14:50.320 --> 14:55.320
 the sense was that math is like fundamental

14:56.000 --> 14:58.600
 to the development of the human mind.

14:58.600 --> 15:02.400
 So math, but also science and literature, by the way,

15:02.400 --> 15:04.600
 was also hit very hard.

15:04.600 --> 15:08.200
 Like we read a lot of serious adult stuff.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.920
 America does that a little bit too.

15:09.920 --> 15:12.600
 They challenge young adults with good literature,

15:12.600 --> 15:16.160
 but they don't challenge adults very much with math.

15:16.160 --> 15:20.840
 So those two things, valuing excellence

15:20.840 --> 15:23.680
 and just a lot of math in the curriculum.

15:23.680 --> 15:26.880
 Do you think, do you find that interesting?

15:26.880 --> 15:28.680
 Because it seems to have been successful.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.160
 Yeah, I think that's very interesting.

15:30.160 --> 15:32.680
 And there is a lot of success,

15:32.680 --> 15:34.080
 people coming through the Soviet system.

15:34.080 --> 15:37.320
 I think something that's very different to the US

15:37.320 --> 15:39.440
 and other countries in the world

15:39.440 --> 15:41.920
 is that idea that excellence is important

15:41.920 --> 15:44.080
 and you can get there if you work hard.

15:44.920 --> 15:48.680
 In the US, there's an idea that excellence is important,

15:48.680 --> 15:52.120
 but then kids are given the idea in many ways

15:52.120 --> 15:53.720
 that you can either do it

15:53.720 --> 15:56.120
 or you're one of the people who can't.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.440
 So many students in the school system

15:58.440 --> 15:59.680
 think they're one of the kids who can't.

15:59.680 --> 16:02.280
 So there's no point in trying hard

16:02.280 --> 16:04.680
 because you're never going to get there.

16:04.680 --> 16:09.600
 So if you can switch that idea, it would be huge.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.120
 And it seems from what you've said

16:11.120 --> 16:16.120
 that in the Soviet Union, that idea is really different.

16:16.280 --> 16:19.560
 Now, the downside of that idea that anybody can get there

16:19.560 --> 16:24.000
 if you work hard is that thought

16:24.000 --> 16:26.480
 that if you're not getting there, it's your fault.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.680
 And I would add something into that.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.680
 I would say that anybody can get there,

16:31.800 --> 16:35.120
 but they need to work hard and they also need good teaching

16:35.120 --> 16:37.960
 because there are some people who really can't get there

16:37.960 --> 16:41.240
 because they're not given access to that good teaching.

16:41.240 --> 16:44.600
 So, but that would be huge, that change.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.480
 As to doing lots of maths,

16:46.480 --> 16:50.960
 if maths was interesting and open and creative

16:50.960 --> 16:53.760
 and multi dimensional, I would be all for it.

16:53.760 --> 16:56.040
 We actually run summer camps at Stanford

16:56.040 --> 16:59.080
 where we invite kids in and we give them this maths

16:59.080 --> 17:00.680
 that I love.

17:00.680 --> 17:05.320
 And in our camp classrooms, they were three hours long.

17:05.320 --> 17:09.440
 And when we were planning, the teachers were like three hours,

17:09.440 --> 17:11.480
 are we going to be able to keep the kids excited

17:11.480 --> 17:12.480
 for three hours?

17:12.480 --> 17:15.960
 Turned out they didn't want to go to break or lunch.

17:15.960 --> 17:19.440
 They'd be so into these mathematical patterns.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.080
 We couldn't stop them.

17:21.080 --> 17:22.800
 It was amazing.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.160
 So yeah, if maths was more like that,

17:25.160 --> 17:29.040
 then I think having more of it would be a really good thing.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.960
 So what age are you talking about?

17:30.960 --> 17:35.480
 Is there, could you comment on what age is like

17:35.480 --> 17:39.120
 the most important when people quit math

17:39.120 --> 17:42.760
 or give up on themselves or on math in general?

17:42.760 --> 17:45.520
 And perhaps that age or something earlier

17:45.520 --> 17:48.560
 is really an important moment for them to discover,

17:48.560 --> 17:51.440
 to be inspired to discover the magic of math.

17:51.440 --> 17:54.400
 I think a lot of kids start to give up on themselves

17:54.400 --> 17:59.200
 and maths around from about fifth grade.

17:59.200 --> 18:02.360
 And then those middle school years are really important.

18:02.360 --> 18:04.520
 And fifth grade can be pivotal for kids

18:04.520 --> 18:07.920
 just because they're allowed to explore

18:07.920 --> 18:10.560
 and think in good ways

18:10.560 --> 18:12.240
 in the early grades of elementary school.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.520
 But fifth grade teachers are often like,

18:13.520 --> 18:15.440
 okay, we're going to prepare you now for middle school

18:15.440 --> 18:18.160
 and we're going to give you grades and lots of tests.

18:18.160 --> 18:21.720
 And that's when kids start to feel really badly

18:21.720 --> 18:22.560
 about themselves.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.760
 And so middle school years,

18:24.760 --> 18:27.000
 our camps are middle school students.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.160
 We think of those years as really pivotal.

18:29.160 --> 18:31.640
 Many kids in those years are deciding,

18:31.640 --> 18:35.640
 yes, I'm going to keep going with STEM subjects

18:35.640 --> 18:38.280
 or no, I'm not, that this isn't for me.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.760
 So, I mean, all years are important

18:40.760 --> 18:43.080
 and in all years you can kind of switch kids

18:43.080 --> 18:45.600
 and get them on a different pathway.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.400
 But I think those middle school years are really important.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.800
 So what's the role of the teacher in this?

18:50.800 --> 18:53.040
 So one is the explanation of the subject,

18:53.040 --> 18:58.040
 but do you think teachers should almost do like one on one,

18:58.320 --> 19:01.760
 you know, little Johnny, I believe in you kind of thing?

19:01.760 --> 19:03.800
 Like that energy of like.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.320
 Turns out it's really important.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.440
 There's a study that was done,

19:07.440 --> 19:10.360
 it was actually done in high school English classrooms

19:10.360 --> 19:14.040
 where all kids wrote an essay for their teacher.

19:14.040 --> 19:16.000
 And this was done as an experiment.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.840
 Half of the kids got feedback from their teacher,

19:18.840 --> 19:21.040
 diagnostic feedback, which is great.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.000
 But for half of the kids,

19:22.000 --> 19:23.920
 it said an extra sentence at the bottom

19:23.920 --> 19:26.240
 that the researchers had put on.

19:26.240 --> 19:30.000
 And the kids who read that extra sentence

19:30.000 --> 19:33.480
 did significantly better in English a whole year later.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.720
 The only change was this one sentence.

19:36.720 --> 19:37.640
 What did the sentence say?

19:37.640 --> 19:39.720
 So what did the sentence say?

19:39.720 --> 19:42.880
 The sentence said, I'm giving you this feedback

19:42.880 --> 19:44.080
 because I believe in you.

19:45.200 --> 19:48.640
 And the kids who read that did better a year later.

19:48.640 --> 19:49.480
 Yeah.

19:49.480 --> 19:52.320
 So when I share this with teachers,

19:52.320 --> 19:53.840
 I say, you know, I'm not suggesting

19:53.840 --> 19:56.000
 you put on the bottom of all kids work.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.400
 I'm giving this feedback because I believe in you.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.720
 One of the teachers said to me, we don't put it on a stamp.

20:00.720 --> 20:03.560
 I said, no, don't put it on a stamp.

20:03.560 --> 20:07.960
 It's, but your words are really important.

20:07.960 --> 20:12.480
 And kids are sitting in classrooms all the time thinking,

20:12.480 --> 20:13.880
 what does my teacher think of me?

20:13.880 --> 20:15.680
 Does my teacher think I can do this?

20:17.240 --> 20:19.520
 So it turns out it is really important

20:19.520 --> 20:22.560
 to be saying to kids, I know you can do this.

20:22.560 --> 20:27.560
 And those messages are not given enough by teachers.

20:27.600 --> 20:28.960
 And really believe it.

20:28.960 --> 20:29.800
 And believe it.

20:29.800 --> 20:30.640
 Yeah, it's like.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.440
 You can't just say it, you have to believe it.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.360
 I sometimes, cause it's like,

20:36.520 --> 20:38.000
 it's such a funny dance,

20:38.000 --> 20:39.560
 cause I'm almost such a perfectionist.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.320
 I'm extremely self critical.

20:41.320 --> 20:43.600
 And I have one of the students come up to me

20:43.600 --> 20:48.600
 and it's clear to me that they're not even close to good.

20:49.360 --> 20:52.280
 And it's tempting for me to be like,

20:52.280 --> 20:54.320
 to sort of give up on them mentally.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.840
 But the reality is like,

20:55.840 --> 20:58.920
 if you look at many great people throughout history,

20:58.920 --> 21:00.360
 they sucked at some point.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.200
 Yeah, exactly.

21:01.200 --> 21:04.200
 And some of the greatest took nonlinear paths

21:04.200 --> 21:08.760
 to where they sucked for long into later life.

21:08.760 --> 21:11.960
 And so always kind of believing that this person

21:11.960 --> 21:13.240
 can be great.

21:13.240 --> 21:14.480
 Exactly.

21:14.480 --> 21:15.800
 You have to communicate that,

21:15.800 --> 21:17.600
 plus the fact that they have to work hard.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.000
 That's it, yeah.

21:19.000 --> 21:19.920
 Yeah, and you're right.

21:19.920 --> 21:22.720
 Silicon Valley where I live is filled with people

21:22.720 --> 21:24.520
 who are dropouts at school,

21:24.520 --> 21:28.800
 or who had special needs, who didn't succeed.

21:28.800 --> 21:30.720
 It's very interesting that have gone on

21:30.720 --> 21:34.240
 to do amazing work in creative ways.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.600
 I mean, I do think our school system is set up

21:36.600 --> 21:41.600
 to value good memorizers who can reproduce

21:42.680 --> 21:44.720
 what a teacher is showing them,

21:44.720 --> 21:49.160
 and push away those creative deep thinkers,

21:49.160 --> 21:53.600
 often slower thinkers, they think slowly and deeply.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.320
 And they often get the idea early on

21:55.320 --> 21:59.000
 that they can't be good at maths or other subjects.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.320
 So yeah, I think many of those people

22:02.320 --> 22:05.160
 are the ones who go on and do amazing things.

22:05.160 --> 22:08.280
 So there's a guy named Eric Weinstein.

22:08.280 --> 22:09.800
 I know many mathematicians like this,

22:09.800 --> 22:14.800
 but he talks a lot about having a nonstandard way

22:16.040 --> 22:17.680
 of learning.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.680
 I mean, a lot of great mathematicians,

22:19.680 --> 22:22.080
 a lot of great physicists are like that.

22:22.080 --> 22:24.640
 And he felt like he became quickly,

22:24.640 --> 22:26.360
 he got his PhD at Harvard,

22:26.360 --> 22:28.560
 became quickly an outcast of the system.

22:28.560 --> 22:32.200
 Like the education, especially early education system,

22:32.200 --> 22:33.120
 didn't help him.

22:33.120 --> 22:37.840
 Is there ways for an education system

22:37.840 --> 22:40.320
 to support people like that?

22:40.320 --> 22:42.400
 Is it this kind of multidimensional learning

22:42.400 --> 22:43.240
 that you mentioned?

22:43.240 --> 22:44.280
 Absolutely, absolutely.

22:44.280 --> 22:48.040
 I mean, I think education system still uses an approach

22:48.040 --> 22:50.320
 that was in classrooms hundreds of years ago.

22:50.320 --> 22:53.720
 The textbooks have a lot to answer for

22:53.720 --> 22:58.320
 in producing this very uninspiring mathematics.

22:58.320 --> 23:00.720
 But yeah, if you open up the subject

23:00.720 --> 23:02.960
 and have people see and solve it in different ways,

23:02.960 --> 23:05.320
 and value those different ways.

23:05.320 --> 23:07.280
 Somebody I appreciated a lot

23:07.280 --> 23:09.680
 is a mathematician called Mary Mizikani.

23:09.680 --> 23:10.560
 I don't know if you've heard of her.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.480
 She won the Fields Medal.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.480
 She was from Iran.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.560
 First woman in the world

23:15.560 --> 23:17.800
 to win the Fields Medal in mathematics.

23:17.800 --> 23:19.480
 She died when she was 40.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.240
 She was at Stanford.

23:21.240 --> 23:24.840
 But her work was entirely visual.

23:24.840 --> 23:27.600
 And she talked about how her daughter

23:27.600 --> 23:28.760
 thought she was an artist

23:28.760 --> 23:30.680
 because she was always visualizing.

23:30.680 --> 23:33.680
 And I attended,

23:33.680 --> 23:35.800
 she asked me to chair the PhD defense

23:35.800 --> 23:37.440
 for one of her students.

23:37.440 --> 23:40.280
 And I went to the defense in the math department.

23:40.280 --> 23:41.440
 And it was so interesting

23:41.440 --> 23:45.280
 because this young woman spent like two hours

23:45.280 --> 23:46.800
 sharing her work.

23:46.800 --> 23:47.800
 All of it was visual.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.480
 In fact, I don't think I saw any numbers at all.

23:50.480 --> 23:51.320
 That's awesome.

23:51.320 --> 23:53.440
 And I remember that day thinking,

23:53.440 --> 23:55.920
 wow, I could have brought her like 13 year old

23:55.920 --> 23:56.960
 into this PhD defense.

23:56.960 --> 24:00.280
 They would not recognize this as maths.

24:00.280 --> 24:03.720
 But when Maryam Izzakhani won the Fields Medal,

24:03.720 --> 24:05.640
 all these other mathematicians were saying

24:05.640 --> 24:07.920
 that her work had connected

24:07.920 --> 24:11.240
 all these previously unconnected areas of maths.

24:11.240 --> 24:14.240
 And so, but when she was,

24:14.240 --> 24:16.120
 she also shared that when she was in school,

24:16.120 --> 24:17.640
 when she was about 13,

24:17.640 --> 24:21.040
 she was told that she couldn't do maths.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.680
 She was told that by her teacher.

24:22.680 --> 24:23.960
 Is this is Iran?

24:23.960 --> 24:24.800
 She grew up in Iran.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.080
 In Iran, yeah.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.360
 So I love that.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.320
 To be told you can't be good at maths

24:29.320 --> 24:33.880
 and then go on and win the Fields Medal is cool.

24:33.880 --> 24:37.120
 I've been told by a lot of people in my life

24:37.120 --> 24:38.200
 that I can't do something.

24:38.200 --> 24:39.840
 I'm very, definitely nonstandard.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.280
 But all it takes,

24:42.280 --> 24:45.360
 that's why people talk about like the one teacher

24:45.360 --> 24:46.200
 that changed everything.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.040
 That's right.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.000
 All it takes is one teacher.

24:48.000 --> 24:48.840
 That's right.

24:48.840 --> 24:50.360
 That's the power of that.

24:53.040 --> 24:55.800
 So that's like, that should be inspiring to teachers.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.520
 I think it is.

24:57.520 --> 25:00.000
 You as a single person, given the education system,

25:00.000 --> 25:00.960
 given the incentives,

25:00.960 --> 25:03.240
 you have the power to truly change lives.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.960
 And like 20 years from now,

25:04.960 --> 25:06.640
 I feel as a medalist will walk up to you

25:06.640 --> 25:07.480
 and say thank you.

25:07.480 --> 25:09.320
 Yeah, so you did that for me.

25:09.320 --> 25:10.320
 Yeah, absolutely.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.120
 And I share that with teachers

25:12.120 --> 25:15.520
 that even in this broken system

25:15.520 --> 25:18.920
 of what they have to do for districts and textbooks,

25:19.760 --> 25:22.880
 a single teacher can change kids maths relationship

25:22.880 --> 25:26.440
 or other subjects forever.

25:26.440 --> 25:29.560
 What's the role of the parents in this picture?

25:29.560 --> 25:31.640
 Let's go to another difficult subject.

25:31.640 --> 25:34.080
 Yeah, that is a difficult subject.

25:34.080 --> 25:36.080
 One study found that

25:38.400 --> 25:42.720
 the amount of maths anxiety parents had

25:42.720 --> 25:45.360
 predicted their child's achievement in school,

25:46.640 --> 25:50.360
 but only if they helped with homework.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.560
 So...

25:52.560 --> 25:57.000
 Oh, that's so funny.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.800
 There are some interesting implications for this.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.240
 I mean, you can see how it works.

26:01.240 --> 26:02.480
 If you have maths anxiety

26:02.480 --> 26:03.840
 and you're helping your kids with homework,

26:03.840 --> 26:06.200
 you're probably communicating things like,

26:06.200 --> 26:09.080
 oh, I was terrible at this at school.

26:09.080 --> 26:12.400
 And that's how it gets passed on to kids.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.560
 So one implication is

26:14.560 --> 26:16.920
 if you have a really bad relationship with maths,

26:16.920 --> 26:19.040
 you hate maths, you have maths anxiety,

26:19.040 --> 26:22.840
 just don't do maths homework with your kids.

26:22.840 --> 26:25.840
 But we have on our website,

26:25.840 --> 26:28.480
 we have a little sheet for parents

26:28.480 --> 26:33.480
 of ways to interact around maths with your kids and...

26:33.720 --> 26:36.560
 That's ucubed.org.

26:36.560 --> 26:39.280
 That's ucubed.org, yes.

26:39.280 --> 26:40.920
 So one of the things I say to parents

26:40.920 --> 26:42.960
 when I give parent presentations is

26:42.960 --> 26:44.680
 even if you hate maths,

26:44.680 --> 26:46.760
 you need to just fake it with your kids.

26:46.760 --> 26:49.960
 You should be always endlessly optimistic

26:49.960 --> 26:52.200
 and happy about doing maths.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.040
 And...

26:54.040 --> 26:55.440
 I'm always curious about this.

26:55.440 --> 26:57.840
 So I hope to have kids one day.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.200
 I don't have kids currently.

27:00.840 --> 27:04.080
 Are parents okay with like sucking at maths

27:04.080 --> 27:06.400
 and then trying to get their kid

27:06.400 --> 27:07.840
 to be better than them essentially?

27:07.840 --> 27:09.960
 Like, is that difficult thing for a lot of parents?

27:09.960 --> 27:10.880
 It is difficult.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.840
 To have like, it's almost like an ego thing.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.120
 Like, I never got good at this

27:15.120 --> 27:16.840
 and I probably should have.

27:16.840 --> 27:20.840
 And yeah, I mean, to me, you wanna celebrate that,

27:20.840 --> 27:23.840
 but I know a lot of people struggle with that.

27:23.840 --> 27:25.920
 Like coaches in sports,

27:25.920 --> 27:29.680
 to make an athlete become better than them,

27:29.680 --> 27:31.760
 it can be hard on the ego.

27:31.760 --> 27:32.680
 Yeah.

27:32.680 --> 27:35.680
 So do you experience the same with parents too?

27:35.680 --> 27:38.000
 I think, I mean, I haven't experienced parents

27:38.000 --> 27:40.800
 worrying that their kids will be better than them.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.800
 I have experienced...

27:42.800 --> 27:45.560
 I have experienced parents

27:45.560 --> 27:47.920
 just having a really bad relationship with maths

27:47.920 --> 27:50.280
 and not wanting to help,

27:50.280 --> 27:54.000
 not knowing how to help, saying things.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.680
 Like another study showed that when mothers

27:56.680 --> 27:58.120
 say to their daughters,

27:58.120 --> 28:00.080
 I was bad at maths in school,

28:00.080 --> 28:02.440
 their daughter's achievement goes down.

28:02.440 --> 28:05.280
 So we know that kids pick up on these messages

28:05.280 --> 28:08.400
 and which is why I say you should fake it.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.160
 But also I know that lots of people

28:10.160 --> 28:12.320
 have just had a really bad relationship with maths,

28:12.320 --> 28:15.120
 even successful people.

28:15.120 --> 28:17.520
 The undergrads I teach at Stanford

28:17.520 --> 28:20.080
 have pretty much always done well in maths,

28:21.040 --> 28:24.040
 but they come to Stanford thinking maths

28:24.040 --> 28:27.000
 is a set of methods to memorize.

28:28.200 --> 28:31.440
 And so, so do many parents believe that.

28:31.440 --> 28:34.320
 There's one method that you memorize

28:34.320 --> 28:36.880
 and then you reproduce it.

28:36.880 --> 28:40.080
 So until people have really had an experience

28:40.080 --> 28:42.280
 of what I think of as the other maths,

28:42.280 --> 28:43.760
 well, until they've really seen

28:43.760 --> 28:45.600
 that it's a really different subject,

28:48.640 --> 28:51.280
 it's hard for them to be able to shift their kids

28:51.280 --> 28:52.640
 to see it differently.

28:52.640 --> 28:55.040
 Is there for a teacher,

28:55.040 --> 28:57.920
 if we were to like systematize it,

28:57.920 --> 28:59.800
 is there something teachers can do

28:59.800 --> 29:01.400
 to do this more effectively?

29:01.400 --> 29:04.040
 So you mentioned the textbook.

29:04.040 --> 29:04.880
 Yeah.

29:04.880 --> 29:07.200
 So what are the additional things

29:07.200 --> 29:10.000
 you can add on top of this whole old school

29:10.000 --> 29:14.720
 traditional way of teaching that can improve the process?

29:14.720 --> 29:17.560
 So I do think there's a way of teaching maths

29:17.560 --> 29:21.680
 that changes everything for kids and teachers.

29:21.680 --> 29:25.480
 So I'm one of five writers of a new framework

29:25.480 --> 29:27.600
 for the state of California, a new maths framework.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.240
 It's coming out next year.

29:29.240 --> 29:32.280
 And we are recommending through this maths framework

29:32.280 --> 29:33.880
 that people teach in this way.

29:33.880 --> 29:37.520
 It's called teaching to big ideas.

29:37.520 --> 29:42.520
 So at the moment, people have standards

29:42.520 --> 29:43.440
 that have been written,

29:43.440 --> 29:45.760
 and then textbooks have taken these standards

29:45.760 --> 29:48.840
 and made not very good questions.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.480
 And if you look at the standards,

29:50.480 --> 29:53.040
 like I have some written down here,

29:53.040 --> 29:54.560
 just reading the standards,

29:54.560 --> 29:57.760
 it makes maths seem really boring and uninspiring.

29:57.760 --> 30:00.880
 What are the kind of, can you give a few examples?

30:00.880 --> 30:03.160
 So this is an interesting example.

30:03.160 --> 30:06.160
 In third grade, there are three different standards

30:06.160 --> 30:07.640
 about unit squares.

30:10.480 --> 30:11.640
 Okay.

30:11.640 --> 30:12.600
 So this is one of them.

30:12.600 --> 30:16.120
 A square with side length one unit, called a unit square,

30:16.120 --> 30:18.760
 is said to have one square unit of area

30:18.760 --> 30:20.560
 and can be used to measure area.

30:20.560 --> 30:23.400
 And that's something you're expected to learn?

30:23.400 --> 30:25.600
 That is something, so that's a standard.

30:25.600 --> 30:26.920
 The textbook authors say,

30:26.920 --> 30:28.400
 oh, I'm gonna make a question about that.

30:28.400 --> 30:32.160
 And they translate the standards into narrow questions.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.960
 And then you measure success by your ability

30:33.960 --> 30:36.880
 to deliver on these standards.

30:36.880 --> 30:40.240
 So the standards themselves, I think of maths

30:40.240 --> 30:41.800
 and many people think of maths in this way

30:41.800 --> 30:44.760
 as a subject of like a few big ideas

30:44.760 --> 30:47.120
 and really important connections between them.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.400
 So you could think of it as like a network map

30:50.400 --> 30:52.600
 of ideas and connections.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.800
 And what standards do is they take that beautiful map

30:55.800 --> 30:58.720
 and they chop it up like this into lots of little pieces

30:58.720 --> 31:01.000
 and they deliver the pieces to schools.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.240
 And so teachers don't see the connections between ideas,

31:05.240 --> 31:06.400
 nor do the kids.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.400
 So anyway, this is a bit of a long way of saying

31:08.400 --> 31:11.840
 that what we've done in this new initiative

31:11.840 --> 31:16.080
 is we have set out maths as a set of big ideas

31:16.080 --> 31:17.520
 and connections between them.

31:17.520 --> 31:20.840
 So this is grade three.

31:20.840 --> 31:25.120
 So instead of there being 60 standards,

31:25.120 --> 31:29.640
 we've said, well, you can pull these different standards

31:29.640 --> 31:32.200
 to get in with each other

31:32.200 --> 31:37.200
 and also value the ways these are connected.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.840
 And by the way, for people who are just listening,

31:39.840 --> 31:44.000
 we're looking at a small number of like big concepts

31:44.000 --> 31:46.400
 within mathematics, square towels,

31:46.400 --> 31:49.040
 measuring fraction, shape and time,

31:49.040 --> 31:51.680
 and then how they're interconnected.

31:51.680 --> 31:55.040
 And so the goal, this is for grade three, for example.

31:55.040 --> 31:58.960
 Yeah, and so we've set out for the state of California,

31:58.960 --> 32:02.520
 the whole of mathematics K10

32:02.520 --> 32:05.120
 as a set of big ideas and connections.

32:05.120 --> 32:08.480
 So we know that teachers, it works really well

32:08.480 --> 32:13.480
 if they say, okay, so a big idea in my grade is measuring.

32:15.560 --> 32:19.160
 And instead of reading five procedural statements

32:19.160 --> 32:21.440
 that involve measuring, they think,

32:21.440 --> 32:22.560
 okay, measuring is a big idea.

32:22.560 --> 32:25.360
 What rich, deep activity can I use

32:25.360 --> 32:27.880
 that teaches measuring to kids?

32:27.880 --> 32:30.440
 And as kids work on these deep, rich activities,

32:30.440 --> 32:32.600
 maybe over a few days,

32:32.600 --> 32:34.920
 turns out a lot of maths comes into it.

32:35.800 --> 32:40.120
 So we're recommending that let's not teach maths

32:40.120 --> 32:43.400
 according to all these multiple statements

32:43.400 --> 32:45.560
 and lots and lots of short questions.

32:45.560 --> 32:47.480
 Instead, let's teach maths

32:47.480 --> 32:49.240
 by thinking about what are the big ideas

32:49.240 --> 32:52.240
 and what are really rich, deep activities

32:52.240 --> 32:53.720
 that teach those big ideas.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.880
 So that's the, like how you teach it

32:55.880 --> 32:57.600
 and maximize learning.

32:57.600 --> 33:01.440
 What about like from a school district perspective,

33:01.440 --> 33:04.640
 like measuring how well you're doing,

33:04.640 --> 33:07.000
 grades and tests and stuff like that.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.880
 Do you throw those out or is it possible?

33:08.880 --> 33:13.440
 I am not a fan of grades and tests myself.

33:13.440 --> 33:15.920
 I think grades are fine

33:15.920 --> 33:18.960
 if they're used at the end of a course.

33:18.960 --> 33:21.000
 So at the end of my maths course,

33:21.000 --> 33:23.080
 I might get a grade because a grade is meant

33:23.080 --> 33:24.360
 to be a summative measure.

33:24.360 --> 33:27.680
 It kind of describes your summative achievement.

33:27.680 --> 33:30.040
 But the problem we have in maths classrooms

33:30.040 --> 33:33.440
 across the US is people use grades all the time,

33:33.440 --> 33:36.360
 every week or every day even.

33:36.360 --> 33:38.560
 My own kids, when they went through high school,

33:38.560 --> 33:40.560
 technology has not helped with this.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.800
 When they went through high school,

33:41.800 --> 33:42.840
 they knew they were being graded

33:42.840 --> 33:45.880
 for everything they did, everything.

33:45.880 --> 33:48.120
 And not only were they being graded for everything,

33:48.120 --> 33:50.400
 but they could see it in the grade book online

33:50.400 --> 33:52.880
 and it would alter every class they went into.

33:52.880 --> 33:54.920
 So this is the ultimate,

33:54.920 --> 33:57.480
 what I think of as a performance culture.

33:57.480 --> 34:00.120
 You're there to perform, somebody's measuring you,

34:00.120 --> 34:01.840
 you see your score.

34:03.720 --> 34:08.600
 So I think that's not conducive for deep learning.

34:08.600 --> 34:10.960
 And yes, have a grade at the end of the year,

34:10.960 --> 34:12.400
 but during the year,

34:12.400 --> 34:14.600
 you can assess kids in much better ways.

34:14.600 --> 34:18.720
 Like teachers can, a great way of assessing kids

34:18.720 --> 34:22.080
 is to give them a rubric that kind of outlines

34:22.080 --> 34:24.000
 what they're learning over the course of a unit

34:24.000 --> 34:25.760
 or a few weeks.

34:25.760 --> 34:28.760
 So kids can actually see the journey they're on,

34:28.760 --> 34:31.120
 like this is what we're doing mathematically.

34:31.120 --> 34:34.360
 Sometimes they self assess on those units

34:34.360 --> 34:39.360
 and then teachers will show what the kids can do

34:40.000 --> 34:42.160
 with a rubric and also write notes.

34:42.160 --> 34:43.560
 Like in the next few weeks,

34:43.560 --> 34:45.960
 you might like to learn to do this.

34:48.160 --> 34:49.840
 So instead of kids just thinking about,

34:49.840 --> 34:51.160
 I'm an A kid or a B kid,

34:51.160 --> 34:53.200
 or I have this letter attached to me,

34:53.200 --> 34:56.920
 they're actually seeing mathematically what's important

34:56.920 --> 34:58.600
 and they're involved in the process

34:58.600 --> 35:02.320
 of knowing where they are mathematically.

35:02.320 --> 35:04.840
 At the end of the year, sure, they can have a grade,

35:04.840 --> 35:06.240
 but during the year,

35:06.240 --> 35:09.200
 they get these much more informative measures.

35:10.160 --> 35:14.760
 I do think this might be more for college,

35:14.760 --> 35:16.320
 but maybe not.

35:16.320 --> 35:18.640
 Some of the best classes I've had

35:18.640 --> 35:23.640
 is when I got a special like set aside,

35:23.720 --> 35:27.840
 like the professor clearly saw that I was interested

35:27.840 --> 35:29.880
 in some aspect of a thing.

35:29.880 --> 35:34.760
 And then I have a few in mind and one in particular,

35:34.760 --> 35:38.080
 when he said that he kind of challenged me.

35:38.080 --> 35:41.320
 So this is outside of grades and all that kind of stuff

35:41.320 --> 35:44.880
 that basically it's like reverse psychology.

35:44.880 --> 35:47.200
 I don't think this can be done.

35:47.200 --> 35:50.960
 And so I gave everything to do that particular thing.

35:50.960 --> 35:54.320
 So this happened to be in an artificial intelligence class.

35:54.320 --> 35:57.600
 But I think that like special treatment

35:57.600 --> 36:01.840
 of taking students who are especially like excellent

36:01.840 --> 36:03.480
 at a particular little aspect,

36:03.480 --> 36:06.120
 that you see their eyes light up.

36:06.120 --> 36:09.480
 I often think like maybe it's tempting for a teacher

36:09.480 --> 36:11.680
 to think you've already succeeded there,

36:11.680 --> 36:13.400
 but they're actually signaling to you

36:13.400 --> 36:17.280
 that like you could really launch them on their way.

36:18.600 --> 36:21.640
 And I don't know, that's too much to expect from teachers

36:21.640 --> 36:24.920
 I think to pay attention to all of that

36:24.920 --> 36:25.960
 because it's really difficult.

36:25.960 --> 36:30.000
 But I just kind of remember who are the biggest,

36:30.000 --> 36:32.320
 the most important people in the history

36:32.320 --> 36:34.840
 of my life of education.

36:34.840 --> 36:37.880
 And it's those people that who really didn't just

36:37.880 --> 36:40.400
 like inspire me with their awesomeness, which they did,

36:40.400 --> 36:42.840
 but also just they pushed me a little.

36:42.840 --> 36:45.200
 Like they gave me a little push.

36:45.200 --> 36:47.480
 And that requires focusing on the quote unquote

36:47.480 --> 36:50.520
 excellent students in the class.

36:50.520 --> 36:53.840
 Yeah, I think what's important though is teachers

36:53.840 --> 36:56.040
 to have the perspective that they don't know

36:56.040 --> 36:58.480
 who's gonna be excellent at something

36:58.480 --> 37:00.320
 before they give out the activity.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.160
 Exactly.

37:01.160 --> 37:04.760
 And in our camp classes that we ran,

37:05.720 --> 37:10.440
 sometimes students would finish ahead of other students.

37:10.440 --> 37:15.280
 And we would say to them, can you write a question

37:15.280 --> 37:16.880
 that's like this but different?

37:19.080 --> 37:21.440
 Oh, and over time we encourage them

37:21.440 --> 37:24.800
 to like extend things further.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.800
 I remember we were doing one activity

37:26.800 --> 37:30.160
 where kids were working out the borders of a square

37:30.160 --> 37:33.560
 and how big this border would be in different case sizes.

37:33.560 --> 37:36.280
 And one of the boys came up at the end of the class

37:36.280 --> 37:38.880
 and said, I've been thinking about how you do this

37:38.880 --> 37:40.480
 to the Pentagon.

37:40.480 --> 37:42.200
 And I said, that's fantastic.

37:42.200 --> 37:44.440
 How do you, what does it look like with Pentagon?

37:44.440 --> 37:47.200
 Go find out, see if you can discover.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.720
 So I didn't know he was gonna come up and say that.

37:49.720 --> 37:53.560
 And I didn't have in my head like this is the kid

37:53.560 --> 37:55.600
 who could have this extension task,

37:55.600 --> 37:58.800
 but you can still do that as a teacher.

37:59.720 --> 38:01.320
 When kids get excited about something

38:01.320 --> 38:03.160
 or they're doing well in something,

38:03.160 --> 38:06.200
 have them extend it, go further.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.040
 It's great.

38:07.040 --> 38:10.480
 And then you also, like this is like teacher and coach,

38:11.680 --> 38:13.920
 you could say it in different ways to different students.

38:13.920 --> 38:18.920
 Like for me, the right thing to say is almost to say,

38:18.920 --> 38:21.320
 I don't think you could do this, this is too hard.

38:21.320 --> 38:23.080
 Like that's what I need to hear.

38:23.080 --> 38:26.320
 It's just like, no, there's immediate push.

38:26.320 --> 38:29.200
 But with some people, if they're a little bit more,

38:29.200 --> 38:31.200
 I mean, it's all has to do with upbringing,

38:31.200 --> 38:33.200
 how your genetics is.

38:33.200 --> 38:35.360
 They might be much more, that might break them.

38:35.360 --> 38:36.200
 Yeah, that might break them.

38:36.200 --> 38:38.320
 And so you have to be also sensitive to that.

38:38.320 --> 38:42.200
 I mean, teaching is really difficult for this very reason.

38:42.200 --> 38:43.200
 It is.

38:43.200 --> 38:47.720
 So what is the best way to teach math,

38:47.720 --> 38:50.760
 to learn math at those early few days

38:50.760 --> 38:52.360
 when you just wanna capture them?

38:53.680 --> 38:56.320
 I do something, actually there's a video of me

38:56.320 --> 38:58.840
 doing this on our website that I love

38:58.840 --> 39:03.160
 when I first meet students.

39:03.160 --> 39:04.280
 And this is what I do.

39:04.280 --> 39:08.240
 I show them a picture, this is the picture I show them.

39:08.240 --> 39:11.000
 And it's a picture of seven dots like this.

39:12.960 --> 39:15.720
 And I show it for just a few seconds and I say to them,

39:15.720 --> 39:17.640
 I'd like you to tell me how many dots there are,

39:17.640 --> 39:19.120
 but I don't want you to count them.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.800
 I want you to group the dots.

39:20.800 --> 39:24.120
 And I show it them and then I take it away

39:24.120 --> 39:27.040
 before they've even had enough time to count them.

39:27.040 --> 39:29.720
 And then I ask them, so how did you see it?

39:29.720 --> 39:34.720
 And I go around the room and amazingly enough,

39:35.000 --> 39:36.960
 there's probably 18 different ways

39:36.960 --> 39:38.280
 of seeing these seven dots.

39:39.240 --> 39:42.240
 And so I ask people, tell me how you grouped it.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.320
 And some people see it as like an outside hole

39:44.320 --> 39:45.680
 with a center dot.

39:45.680 --> 39:49.240
 Some people see like stripes of lines.

39:49.240 --> 39:51.760
 Some people see segments.

39:51.760 --> 39:53.760
 And I collect them all and I put them on the board.

39:53.760 --> 39:55.400
 And at the end I say, look at this,

39:55.400 --> 39:57.240
 we are a class of 30 kids

39:57.240 --> 40:00.240
 and we saw these seven dots in 18 different ways.

40:00.240 --> 40:01.880
 There's actually a mathematical term for this.

40:01.880 --> 40:03.760
 It's called groupitizing.

40:03.760 --> 40:04.720
 Groupitizing?

40:04.720 --> 40:05.560
 Yeah.

40:05.560 --> 40:06.720
 I like it.

40:06.720 --> 40:07.560
 It's kind of cool.

40:07.560 --> 40:11.840
 So turns out though that how well you groupitize

40:11.840 --> 40:15.480
 predicts how well you do in maths.

40:15.480 --> 40:18.920
 Is it a raw talent or is it just something

40:18.920 --> 40:19.760
 that you can develop?

40:19.760 --> 40:20.600
 I don't think it's raw.

40:20.600 --> 40:22.600
 I don't think you're born groupitizing, I think,

40:22.600 --> 40:27.280
 but some kids have developed that ability if you like.

40:27.280 --> 40:28.960
 And you can learn it.

40:28.960 --> 40:33.960
 So this to me is part of how wrong we have maths.

40:34.120 --> 40:36.600
 That we think to tell whether a kid's good at maths,

40:36.600 --> 40:40.600
 we're gonna give them a speed test on multiples.

40:40.600 --> 40:43.880
 But actually seeing how kids group dots

40:43.880 --> 40:46.120
 could be a more important assessment

40:46.120 --> 40:48.200
 of how well they're gonna do in maths.

40:48.200 --> 40:49.560
 Anyway, I diverge.

40:49.560 --> 40:52.280
 What I like to do though when I start off with kids

40:52.280 --> 40:54.520
 is show them I'm gonna give you maths problems.

40:54.520 --> 40:57.040
 I'm gonna value the different ways you see them.

40:57.040 --> 40:59.840
 And it turns out you can do this kind of problem

40:59.840 --> 41:03.000
 asking people how they group dots with young children

41:03.000 --> 41:05.400
 or with graduate students.

41:05.400 --> 41:08.160
 And it's engaging for all of them.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.080
 You talk about creativity a little bit

41:12.080 --> 41:15.120
 and flexibility in your book Limitless.

41:15.120 --> 41:16.680
 What's the role of that?

41:16.680 --> 41:19.680
 So it sounds like there's a bit of that kind of thing

41:19.680 --> 41:22.600
 involved in groupitizing.

41:22.600 --> 41:24.520
 Yeah, yeah.

41:24.520 --> 41:25.600
 I love this term.

41:25.600 --> 41:28.480
 So what would you say is the role of creativity

41:28.480 --> 41:31.240
 and flexibility in the learning of maths?

41:31.240 --> 41:34.720
 I think what we know now is that what we need

41:34.720 --> 41:39.720
 for this 21st century world we live in is a flexible mind.

41:42.040 --> 41:44.360
 School should not really be about teaching kids

41:44.360 --> 41:46.200
 particular methods but teaching them

41:46.200 --> 41:49.440
 to approach problems with flexibility.

41:49.440 --> 41:52.840
 Being creative, thinking creatively is really important.

41:52.840 --> 41:56.960
 So people don't think the words maths and creativity

41:56.960 --> 42:00.240
 come together, but that's what I love about maths

42:00.240 --> 42:02.880
 is the creative different ways you can see it.

42:02.880 --> 42:07.880
 And so helping our kids, there's a book I like a lot

42:08.600 --> 42:13.600
 by physicists, you probably know this book called Elastic.

42:13.920 --> 42:14.840
 You might know it.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.440
 And it's about how we want elastic minds.

42:18.440 --> 42:21.440
 Same kind of thing, flexible, creative minds.

42:21.440 --> 42:26.440
 And schools do very little on developing that kind of mind.

42:26.800 --> 42:31.720
 They do a lot of developing the kind of mind

42:31.720 --> 42:35.280
 that a computer now does for us.

42:35.280 --> 42:36.520
 Memorization.

42:36.520 --> 42:41.520
 Memorization, doing procedures, a lot of things

42:41.880 --> 42:45.320
 that we spend a lot of time in school on.

42:45.320 --> 42:47.480
 In the world, when kids leave school,

42:47.480 --> 42:52.480
 a computer will do that and better than they will.

42:52.520 --> 42:54.840
 But that creative, flexible thinking,

42:54.840 --> 42:57.120
 we're kind of at ground zero at computers

42:57.120 --> 42:59.480
 being able to engage in that thinking.

42:59.480 --> 43:00.880
 Maybe we're a little above ground zero,

43:00.880 --> 43:05.760
 but the human brain is perfectly suited

43:05.760 --> 43:07.520
 for that creative, flexible thinking.

43:07.520 --> 43:09.840
 That's what humans are so great at.

43:09.840 --> 43:12.040
 So I would like the balance to shift in schools.

43:12.040 --> 43:15.120
 Maybe you still need to do some procedural kind of thinking,

43:15.120 --> 43:17.680
 but there should be a lot more of that creative,

43:17.680 --> 43:18.880
 flexible thinking.

43:20.160 --> 43:24.000
 And what's the role of other humans in this picture?

43:24.000 --> 43:29.000
 So collaborative learning, so brainstorming together.

43:29.400 --> 43:33.760
 So creativity as it emerges from the collective intelligence

43:33.760 --> 43:34.600
 of multiple humans.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.520
 Yeah, super important.

43:36.520 --> 43:40.600
 And we know that also helps develop your brain,

43:40.600 --> 43:42.360
 that social side of thinking.

43:42.360 --> 43:44.920
 And I love mathematics collaboration

43:44.920 --> 43:47.560
 where people build on each other's ideas

43:47.560 --> 43:49.760
 and they come up with amazing things.

43:49.760 --> 43:54.080
 I actually taught a hundred students calculus

43:54.080 --> 43:56.880
 at Stanford recently, undergrads,

43:56.880 --> 43:59.440
 and we taught them to collaborate.

43:59.440 --> 44:01.280
 So these students came in Stanford

44:01.280 --> 44:04.640
 and most of them were against collaboration in math.

44:04.640 --> 44:06.240
 This is before COVID in person?

44:06.240 --> 44:08.360
 Yeah, it was just before COVID hit.

44:08.360 --> 44:10.240
 It was 2019.

44:10.240 --> 44:12.080
 And this summer.

44:12.080 --> 44:13.800
 So you said they're against?

44:13.800 --> 44:16.720
 Yeah, so it's really interesting.

44:16.720 --> 44:20.160
 So they'd only experienced maths individually

44:20.160 --> 44:22.080
 in a kind of competitive individual way.

44:22.080 --> 44:24.640
 And if they had experienced it as group work,

44:24.640 --> 44:26.560
 it had been a bad experience.

44:26.560 --> 44:28.800
 Like maybe they were the one who did it all

44:28.800 --> 44:31.480
 and the others didn't do much.

44:31.480 --> 44:33.120
 So they were kind of against collaboration.

44:33.120 --> 44:35.080
 They didn't see any role for it in maths.

44:35.080 --> 44:39.720
 And we taught them to collaborate and it was hard work

44:39.720 --> 44:42.120
 because as well as the fact

44:42.120 --> 44:43.520
 that they were kind of against collaboration,

44:43.520 --> 44:48.440
 they came in with a lot of like social comparison thinking.

44:48.440 --> 44:51.440
 So I'm in this room with other Stanford undergrads

44:51.440 --> 44:53.480
 and they're better than me or...

44:53.480 --> 44:55.720
 So when we set them to work on a maths problem together,

44:55.720 --> 44:57.200
 the first one was kind of a disaster

44:57.200 --> 44:59.200
 because they put all like, they're better than me.

44:59.200 --> 45:00.440
 They're faster than me.

45:00.440 --> 45:02.560
 They came up with something I didn't come up with.

45:02.560 --> 45:05.920
 So we taught them to let go of that thinking

45:05.920 --> 45:08.560
 and to work well together.

45:08.560 --> 45:10.760
 And one of the things we did, we decided

45:10.760 --> 45:12.520
 we wanted to do a pre and post test

45:12.520 --> 45:13.440
 at the end of this teaching.

45:13.440 --> 45:16.440
 It was only four weeks long, but we knew

45:16.440 --> 45:18.320
 we didn't want to give them like a time test

45:18.320 --> 45:19.280
 of individual work.

45:19.280 --> 45:23.680
 So we gave them an applied problem to do at the beginning

45:23.680 --> 45:26.160
 and we gave them to do in pairs together.

45:26.160 --> 45:28.560
 And we gave each of them a different colored pen

45:28.560 --> 45:30.960
 and said, work on this activity together

45:30.960 --> 45:33.000
 and keep using that pen.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.120
 So then we had all these pieces of student work.

45:35.120 --> 45:37.520
 And what we saw was they just worked

45:37.520 --> 45:39.160
 on separate parts of the paper.

45:39.160 --> 45:42.000
 So there's a little like red pen section

45:42.000 --> 45:43.680
 and a green pen section.

45:43.680 --> 45:45.880
 And they didn't do that well on it.

45:45.880 --> 45:48.760
 Even though it was a problem that middle

45:48.760 --> 45:49.760
 or high school kids could do,

45:49.760 --> 45:52.680
 but it was like a problem solving kind of problem.

45:52.680 --> 45:55.000
 And then we gave them the same one to do at the end,

45:55.000 --> 45:56.160
 gave them the same colors.

45:56.160 --> 45:59.160
 And actually they had learned to collaborate.

45:59.160 --> 46:02.080
 And not only were they collaborating the second time round,

46:02.080 --> 46:04.000
 but that boosted their achievement.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.840
 And the ones who collaborated did better on the problem.

46:07.840 --> 46:10.200
 Collaboration is important, having people,

46:10.200 --> 46:12.480
 and what was so eye opening for these undergrads

46:12.480 --> 46:15.320
 and they talked about it in lovely ways

46:15.320 --> 46:19.920
 was I learned to value other people's thinking on a problem.

46:19.920 --> 46:22.280
 And I learned to value that other people

46:22.280 --> 46:24.280
 saw it in different ways.

46:24.280 --> 46:29.280
 And it was quite a big experience for them

46:29.440 --> 46:31.680
 that they came out thinking,

46:31.680 --> 46:33.600
 I can do maths with other people.

46:33.600 --> 46:34.800
 People can see it differently.

46:34.800 --> 46:38.280
 We can build on each other's ways of thinking.

46:38.280 --> 46:39.480
 I got a chance to,

46:39.480 --> 46:42.000
 I don't know if you know who Daniel Kahneman is,

46:42.000 --> 46:44.080
 got a chance to interact with him.

46:44.080 --> 46:45.360
 And like the first,

46:45.360 --> 46:46.880
 cause he had a few,

46:46.880 --> 46:50.480
 but one famous collaboration throughout his life

46:51.960 --> 46:52.920
 with Tversky.

46:52.920 --> 46:55.920
 And just like, you know,

46:55.920 --> 46:58.520
 he hasn't met me before in person,

46:58.520 --> 47:01.280
 but just the number of questions he was asking,

47:01.280 --> 47:03.120
 just the curiosity.

47:03.120 --> 47:05.360
 So I think one of the skills,

47:05.360 --> 47:07.920
 the collaboration itself is a skill.

47:07.920 --> 47:10.720
 And I remember my experience with him was like,

47:10.720 --> 47:14.000
 okay, I get why you're so good at collaboration

47:14.000 --> 47:17.440
 because he was just extremely good at listening

47:17.440 --> 47:21.400
 and genuine curiosity about how the other person

47:21.400 --> 47:23.360
 thinks about the world, sees the world.

47:23.360 --> 47:24.920
 And then together he's,

47:24.920 --> 47:27.440
 he pulled me in in that particular case.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.320
 He doesn't know in particular,

47:29.320 --> 47:31.160
 like that much about autonomous vehicles,

47:31.160 --> 47:34.520
 but he kept like asking all of these questions.

47:34.520 --> 47:36.400
 And then like 10 minutes in,

47:36.400 --> 47:38.080
 we're together trying to solve the problem

47:38.080 --> 47:39.880
 of autonomous driving.

47:39.880 --> 47:43.080
 And like, and that, I mean, that's really fulfilling.

47:43.080 --> 47:43.920
 That's really enriching.

47:43.920 --> 47:46.680
 But it also in that moment made me realize

47:46.680 --> 47:48.160
 it's kind of a skill.

47:48.160 --> 47:50.720
 Cause you have to kind of put your ego aside,

47:50.720 --> 47:52.480
 put your view of the world aside

47:52.480 --> 47:55.760
 and try to learn how the other person sees it.

47:55.760 --> 47:57.560
 And the other thing you have to put aside

47:57.560 --> 48:00.640
 is this social comparison thinking.

48:00.640 --> 48:03.240
 Like if you are sitting there thinking,

48:03.240 --> 48:04.800
 wow, that was an amazing idea.

48:04.800 --> 48:06.600
 He's so much better than I am.

48:06.600 --> 48:09.960
 That's really gonna stop you taking on

48:09.960 --> 48:12.160
 the value of that idea.

48:12.160 --> 48:14.240
 And so there's a lot of that going on

48:14.240 --> 48:17.400
 between these Stanford students when they came.

48:17.400 --> 48:21.880
 And trying to help them let go of that.

48:21.880 --> 48:24.240
 One of the things I've discovered

48:24.240 --> 48:27.320
 just because being a little bit more in the public eye,

48:27.320 --> 48:31.240
 how rewarding it is to celebrate others.

48:31.240 --> 48:35.760
 And how much is going to actually pay off in the long term.

48:35.760 --> 48:38.160
 So this kind of silo thinking of like,

48:38.160 --> 48:41.200
 I want to prove to a small set of people around me

48:41.200 --> 48:45.280
 that I'm really smart and do so

48:45.280 --> 48:47.440
 by basically not celebrating

48:47.440 --> 48:48.760
 how smart the other people are.

48:48.760 --> 48:51.480
 That's actually maybe short term,

48:51.480 --> 48:54.520
 it seems like a good strategy, but long term it's not.

48:54.520 --> 48:56.440
 And I think if you practice at the student level

48:56.440 --> 48:58.840
 and then at the career level, at every single stage,

48:58.840 --> 49:00.440
 I think that's ultimately.

49:00.440 --> 49:01.280
 I agree with you.

49:01.280 --> 49:04.400
 I think that's a really good way of thinking about it.

49:04.400 --> 49:08.240
 You mentioned textbooks and you didn't say it,

49:11.240 --> 49:15.400
 maybe textbooks isn't the perfect way to teach mathematics,

49:15.400 --> 49:16.920
 but I love textbooks.

49:16.920 --> 49:18.560
 They're like pretty pictures

49:18.560 --> 49:19.880
 and they smell nice and they open.

49:19.880 --> 49:21.640
 I mean, I talk about like physical.

49:21.640 --> 49:25.360
 Some of my greatest experiences have been just like,

49:25.360 --> 49:27.240
 cause they're really well done.

49:27.240 --> 49:30.440
 When we're talking about basic, like high school,

49:30.440 --> 49:34.880
 calculus, biology, chemistry, those are like,

49:34.880 --> 49:36.840
 those are incredible.

49:36.840 --> 49:40.320
 It's like Wikipedia, but with color and a nice little.

49:40.320 --> 49:41.920
 You must've seen some good textbooks

49:41.920 --> 49:44.520
 if they had pretty pictures and color.

49:44.520 --> 49:46.200
 Yeah, I mean, I remember,

49:46.200 --> 49:51.200
 I guess it was very, very standard, like AP calculus,

49:51.200 --> 49:53.480
 AP biology, AP chemistry.

49:53.480 --> 49:56.080
 I felt those were like some of the happiest days of my life

49:56.080 --> 49:58.000
 in terms of learning was high school.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.760
 Cause it was very easy, honestly.

50:01.960 --> 50:03.240
 It felt hard at the time,

50:03.240 --> 50:07.080
 but you're basically doing a whirlwind tour

50:07.080 --> 50:08.400
 of all the science.

50:08.400 --> 50:09.400
 Yeah, yeah.

50:09.400 --> 50:12.160
 Without having to pick, you do literature,

50:12.160 --> 50:16.680
 you do like Shakespeare, calculus, biology, physics,

50:17.640 --> 50:19.040
 chemistry, what else?

50:19.040 --> 50:23.520
 Anatomy, physiology, computer science,

50:23.520 --> 50:26.680
 without like, nobody's telling you what to do with your life.

50:26.680 --> 50:28.000
 You're just doing all of those things.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.640
 That's a good thing, you're right.

50:29.640 --> 50:32.440
 But I remember the textbooks weren't,

50:32.440 --> 50:35.400
 I mean, maybe I'm romanticizing the past,

50:35.400 --> 50:38.640
 but I remember they weren't, they're pretty good.

50:38.640 --> 50:42.000
 But so you think, what role do you think they play still?

50:42.000 --> 50:45.480
 And like in this more modern digital age,

50:45.480 --> 50:48.360
 what's the best materials with which to do

50:48.360 --> 50:50.040
 these kinds of educations?

50:50.040 --> 50:52.840
 Well, I'm intrigued that you had such a good experience

50:52.840 --> 50:53.680
 with textbooks.

50:53.680 --> 50:57.080
 I mean, I can remember loving some textbooks I had

50:57.080 --> 50:59.440
 when I was learning and I love books.

50:59.440 --> 51:03.040
 I love to pick up books and look through them,

51:03.040 --> 51:06.480
 but a lot of maths textbooks

51:06.480 --> 51:08.760
 are not good experiences for kids.

51:08.760 --> 51:12.840
 They, we have a video on our website

51:12.840 --> 51:14.080
 of the kids who came to our camp

51:14.080 --> 51:15.600
 and one of the students says,

51:15.600 --> 51:18.760
 in maths, you have to follow the textbook.

51:18.760 --> 51:20.480
 The textbook is kind of like the Bible.

51:20.480 --> 51:22.400
 You have to follow it.

51:22.400 --> 51:25.920
 And every day it's slightly different.

51:25.920 --> 51:28.760
 Like on Monday you do 2.3.2

51:28.760 --> 51:32.480
 and on Tuesday you do 2.3.3 and on Wednesday.

51:32.480 --> 51:35.080
 And you never go off that.

51:35.080 --> 51:37.840
 That's like every single day.

51:37.840 --> 51:42.520
 And that's not inspiring for a lot of the kids.

51:43.520 --> 51:45.400
 So one of the things they loved about our camp

51:45.400 --> 51:46.840
 was just that there were no books.

51:46.840 --> 51:50.680
 Even though we gave them sheets of paper instead,

51:50.680 --> 51:53.040
 they still felt more free

51:53.040 --> 51:56.600
 because they weren't just like trotting through exercises,

51:56.600 --> 51:59.520
 exercises, so.

51:59.520 --> 52:02.720
 Like what a textbook allows you is like you're,

52:03.760 --> 52:06.600
 the very thing you said they might not like,

52:06.600 --> 52:11.080
 the 2.3, 2.3, it feels like you're making progress.

52:11.080 --> 52:12.720
 And like it's little celebrations

52:12.720 --> 52:16.160
 because you do the problem and it seems really hard

52:16.160 --> 52:17.280
 and you don't know how to do it.

52:17.280 --> 52:20.920
 And then you try and try and then eventually succeed.

52:20.920 --> 52:23.600
 And then you make that little step and further progress.

52:23.600 --> 52:26.120
 And then you get to the end of a chapter

52:26.120 --> 52:28.000
 and you get to like, it's closure.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.840
 You're like, all right, I got that figured out.

52:29.840 --> 52:31.320
 And then you go on to the next chapter.

52:31.320 --> 52:32.240
 I can see that.

52:32.240 --> 52:34.880
 I mean, I think it could be in a textbook.

52:34.880 --> 52:38.960
 You can have a good experience with a textbook,

52:38.960 --> 52:43.160
 but what's really important is what is in that textbook?

52:43.160 --> 52:45.280
 What are you doing inside it?

52:45.280 --> 52:47.880
 And I mean, I grew up in England

52:47.880 --> 52:50.440
 and in England we learn maths.

52:50.440 --> 52:54.360
 We don't have this separation of algebra and geometry.

52:54.360 --> 52:56.120
 And I don't think any other country

52:56.120 --> 52:58.200
 apart from the US has that.

52:58.200 --> 53:01.200
 But I look at kids in algebra classes

53:01.200 --> 53:02.720
 where they're doing algebra for a year.

53:02.720 --> 53:05.800
 And I think I would have been pretty bored doing that.

53:05.800 --> 53:10.800
 By the way, can we analyze your upbringing real quick?

53:13.040 --> 53:18.040
 Why do British folks call mathematics, maths?

53:19.960 --> 53:21.120
 Why is it the plural?

53:21.120 --> 53:23.120
 Is it because of everything you're saying

53:23.120 --> 53:25.160
 where it's a bunch of subdisciplines?

53:25.160 --> 53:29.800
 Yeah, I mean, mathematics is supposed to be

53:29.800 --> 53:34.800
 the different maths that you look at,

53:34.800 --> 53:38.040
 whether you think of that as topics

53:38.040 --> 53:39.760
 like geometry and probability,

53:39.760 --> 53:44.760
 or I think of it as maths is just multi dimensional

53:45.160 --> 53:48.720
 lots of ways, but that's why it was called mathematics.

53:48.720 --> 53:50.480
 And then it was shortened to maths.

53:50.480 --> 53:53.360
 And then for some reason it was just math in the US.

53:53.360 --> 53:58.360
 But to me, math has that more singular feel to it.

53:58.440 --> 54:03.000
 And there's an expression here, which is do the math,

54:03.000 --> 54:05.240
 which basically means do a calculation.

54:05.240 --> 54:07.480
 That's what people mean by do the math.

54:07.480 --> 54:09.360
 So I don't like that expression

54:09.360 --> 54:11.240
 because no math could be anything

54:11.240 --> 54:12.480
 doesn't have to be calculation.

54:12.480 --> 54:14.600
 And so yeah, I like maths

54:14.600 --> 54:17.280
 because it has more of that broad feel to it.

54:17.280 --> 54:18.120
 Yeah, I love that.

54:18.120 --> 54:20.000
 Maths kind of emphasize the multi dimensional,

54:20.000 --> 54:22.880
 like a variety of different subdisciplines,

54:22.880 --> 54:23.720
 different approaches.

54:23.720 --> 54:25.320
 Yeah.

54:25.320 --> 54:28.640
 Okay, but outside of the textbook,

54:28.640 --> 54:33.640
 what do you see like broadly being used?

54:33.640 --> 54:36.840
 You mentioned Sebastian Thrun and MOOCs,

54:36.840 --> 54:37.880
 online education.

54:37.880 --> 54:39.480
 Do you think that's an effective set?

54:39.480 --> 54:40.960
 Can be.

54:40.960 --> 54:45.080
 I mean, online, having great teachers online,

54:45.080 --> 54:48.080
 obviously extends those teachers to many more people.

54:48.080 --> 54:49.800
 And that's a wonderful thing.

54:51.480 --> 54:54.280
 I have quite a few online courses myself.

54:54.280 --> 54:56.240
 I got the bug working with Sebastian

54:56.240 --> 54:59.720
 when he had released his first MOOC.

54:59.720 --> 55:03.440
 And I thought, maybe I could do one in maths education.

55:03.440 --> 55:05.520
 And I didn't know if anybody would take it.

55:06.400 --> 55:08.400
 I remember releasing it that first summer

55:08.400 --> 55:09.880
 and it was a free online class

55:09.880 --> 55:13.760
 and 30,000 maths teachers took it that first summer.

55:13.760 --> 55:16.000
 And they were all talking about it with each other

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
 and sharing it and it was like took off.

55:18.000 --> 55:23.000
 In fact, it was that MOOC that got me to create YouCubed

55:23.000 --> 55:26.120
 with Kathy Williams, who's the co founder,

55:26.120 --> 55:28.640
 because people took the MOOC and then they said,

55:28.640 --> 55:30.680
 okay, what now?

55:30.680 --> 55:33.440
 I finished, what can I have next?

55:33.440 --> 55:35.400
 And so that was where we made our website.

55:35.400 --> 55:39.120
 But so yeah, I think online education can be great.

55:39.120 --> 55:43.960
 I do think a lot of the MOOCs don't have great pedagogy.

55:43.960 --> 55:45.960
 They're just a talking head.

55:45.960 --> 55:50.960
 And you can actually engage people in more active ways,

55:50.960 --> 55:53.040
 even in online learning.

55:53.040 --> 55:55.920
 So I learned from the Udacity principle

55:55.920 --> 55:57.320
 when I was working at Udacity,

55:57.320 --> 56:00.200
 never to talk more than like five minutes.

56:00.200 --> 56:03.720
 And then to ask people to do something.

56:03.720 --> 56:07.840
 So that's the sort of pedagogy of the online classes I have

56:07.840 --> 56:10.520
 is a little bit of presenting something

56:10.520 --> 56:13.200
 and then people do something and there's a little bit more.

56:13.200 --> 56:15.280
 Because I think if you have a half hour video,

56:15.280 --> 56:19.200
 you just switch off and start doing other things.

56:19.200 --> 56:22.880
 So the way Udacity did it is like five, 10 minute,

56:22.880 --> 56:27.880
 like bit of teaching with some visual stuff perhaps.

56:27.880 --> 56:29.280
 And then there's like a quiz almost.

56:29.280 --> 56:30.600
 Then you answer a question, yeah.

56:30.600 --> 56:34.040
 Yeah, no, that's really effective.

56:34.040 --> 56:36.120
 You mentioned Ucubed, so what's the mission?

56:36.120 --> 56:36.960
 What's the goal?

56:36.960 --> 56:41.440
 You mentioned how it started, but what's yeah,

56:41.440 --> 56:42.840
 where are you at now?

56:42.840 --> 56:44.680
 And what's your dream with it?

56:44.680 --> 56:47.040
 What are the kind of things that people should go

56:47.040 --> 56:47.880
 and check out?

56:47.880 --> 56:51.560
 Yeah, we started Ucubed, I guess it was about five years

56:51.560 --> 56:55.280
 ago now and we've had over 52 million visitors to the site.

56:55.280 --> 56:57.400
 So I'm very happy about that.

56:57.400 --> 57:01.760
 And our goal is to share good ideas for teaching

57:01.760 --> 57:06.760
 with teachers, students, parents in maths and to help.

57:07.280 --> 57:10.360
 We have a sort of sub goal of a raising maths anxiety.

57:10.360 --> 57:13.240
 That's important to us, but also to share maths

57:13.240 --> 57:15.880
 as this beautiful creative subject.

57:15.880 --> 57:19.560
 And it's been really great.

57:19.560 --> 57:23.560
 We have lessons on the site, but one of the reasons

57:23.560 --> 57:26.720
 I thought this was needed is there's a lot of knowledge

57:26.720 --> 57:29.120
 in the academy about how to teach maths well.

57:29.120 --> 57:32.360
 Loads and loads of research and journals

57:32.360 --> 57:36.360
 and lots of things written up, but teachers don't read it.

57:36.360 --> 57:39.040
 They don't have access to it.

57:39.040 --> 57:43.000
 They're often behind pay walls, they've written

57:43.000 --> 57:46.440
 in really inaccessible ways.

57:46.440 --> 57:49.240
 So people wouldn't want to read them or understand them.

57:49.240 --> 57:51.120
 So this actually is a big problem.

57:51.120 --> 57:54.200
 You have this whole industry of people finding out

57:54.200 --> 57:57.360
 how to teach well, not sharing it with the people

57:57.360 --> 57:58.760
 who are teaching.

57:58.760 --> 58:01.360
 So that's why we made Ucubed.

58:01.360 --> 58:03.640
 And instead of just putting articles up saying,

58:03.640 --> 58:05.760
 here's some things to read about how to teach well,

58:05.760 --> 58:08.200
 we translated what was coming from research

58:08.200 --> 58:10.480
 into things that teacher could use.

58:10.480 --> 58:13.560
 So lessons, there were videos to show kids

58:13.560 --> 58:16.400
 and there were tips for parents.

58:16.400 --> 58:17.960
 There were all sorts of things on the site.

58:17.960 --> 58:20.600
 And it's been amazing.

58:20.600 --> 58:24.840
 As we took inspiration from the week of code,

58:24.840 --> 58:29.520
 which got teachers to focus on coding for a week.

58:29.520 --> 58:31.840
 And we have this thing called the week

58:31.840 --> 58:33.880
 of inspirational maths.

58:33.880 --> 58:35.800
 And we say, just try it for a week.

58:35.800 --> 58:39.360
 Just give us one week and try it and see what happens.

58:39.360 --> 58:42.640
 And so it's been downloaded millions of times.

58:42.640 --> 58:44.560
 Teachers use it every year.

58:44.560 --> 58:46.520
 They start the school year with it.

58:46.520 --> 58:49.640
 And what they tell us is it was amazing.

58:49.640 --> 58:52.960
 The kids lights were on, they were excited, they loved it.

58:52.960 --> 58:56.000
 And then the week finished and I opened my textbooks

58:56.000 --> 59:00.000
 and the lights went out and they were not interested.

59:00.000 --> 59:04.160
 Yeah, but getting that first inspiration is still powerful.

59:04.160 --> 59:07.680
 It is, I wish, I mean, what I would love

59:07.680 --> 59:11.640
 is if we could actually extend that for the whole year.

59:11.640 --> 59:13.960
 We're a small team at Stanford

59:13.960 --> 59:17.000
 and we're trying to keep up with great things

59:17.000 --> 59:18.240
 to put on the site.

59:19.640 --> 59:22.480
 We haven't the capacity to produce

59:22.480 --> 59:24.160
 these creative visual maths tasks

59:24.160 --> 59:25.840
 for every year group for every day,

59:25.840 --> 59:27.120
 but I would love to do that.

59:27.120 --> 59:28.560
 How difficult is it to do?

59:28.560 --> 59:33.560
 I mean, it's to come up with visual formulations

59:33.560 --> 59:38.560
 of these big important topics you need to think about

59:39.000 --> 59:43.320
 in a way that you could teach.

59:43.320 --> 59:44.720
 I mean, we can do it.

59:44.720 --> 59:47.400
 We actually, we went from the week of inspirational maths

59:47.400 --> 59:51.920
 and we made K8 maths books with exactly that.

59:51.920 --> 59:54.880
 Big ideas, rich activities, visuals.

59:54.880 --> 59:56.520
 We just finished the last one.

59:56.520 --> 59:58.920
 We've been doing it for five years

59:58.920 --> 1:00:01.600
 and it's been exhausting and we just finished.

1:00:01.600 --> 1:00:05.560
 So now there's a whole K8 set of books

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:07.120
 and they're organized in that way.

1:00:07.120 --> 1:00:08.320
 These are the big ideas.

1:00:08.320 --> 1:00:10.240
 Here are rich, deep activities.

1:00:11.960 --> 1:00:16.040
 They're not though what you can do every day for a year.

1:00:16.040 --> 1:00:19.040
 So some teachers use them as a kind of supplement

1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:21.000
 to their boring textbook.

1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:24.360
 And some people have said, okay, this is the year.

1:00:24.360 --> 1:00:26.440
 This book tells us what the year is

1:00:26.440 --> 1:00:29.120
 and then we'll supplement these big activities with.

1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:34.120
 So they're being used and teachers really like them

1:00:34.360 --> 1:00:36.160
 and are really happy about them.

1:00:36.160 --> 1:00:37.440
 I just always want more.

1:00:37.440 --> 1:00:40.200
 And I guess one of the things I would like for YouCubed,

1:00:40.200 --> 1:00:43.600
 one of my personal goals is that every teacher of maths

1:00:43.600 --> 1:00:45.400
 knows about YouCubed.

1:00:45.400 --> 1:00:48.440
 At the moment, lots of teachers who come to us

1:00:48.440 --> 1:00:49.760
 are really happy they found it

1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:51.200
 but there's a lot of other teachers

1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:53.520
 who don't know that it exists.

1:00:53.520 --> 1:00:54.920
 I hope this helps.

1:00:54.920 --> 1:00:55.960
 Yeah.

1:00:55.960 --> 1:00:59.440
 From a student perspective and not in the classroom

1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:01.520
 but at home studying,

1:01:03.800 --> 1:01:07.360
 is there some advice you can give

1:01:07.360 --> 1:01:09.760
 on how to best study mathematics?

1:01:09.760 --> 1:01:12.600
 So what's the role of the student outside the classroom?

1:01:13.720 --> 1:01:17.520
 Yeah, I think one thing we know is a lot of people

1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:19.680
 when they review material,

1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:21.320
 whether it's maths or anything else,

1:01:21.320 --> 1:01:23.640
 don't do it in the best way.

1:01:23.640 --> 1:01:25.800
 I think a problem a lot of people have

1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:28.920
 is they read through maybe a teacher's explanation

1:01:28.920 --> 1:01:32.800
 or a way of doing maths and it makes sense.

1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:33.840
 And they think, oh yeah, I've got that.

1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:35.000
 And they move on.

1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:38.840
 But then it's not until you come to try

1:01:38.840 --> 1:01:40.520
 and work on something and do a problem

1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:42.520
 that you actually realize you didn't really understand it,

1:01:42.520 --> 1:01:43.880
 just seemed to make sense.

1:01:44.760 --> 1:01:47.280
 So I would say,

1:01:47.280 --> 1:01:50.600
 this is also something that neuroscientists talk about,

1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:53.400
 to keep giving yourself questions

1:01:53.400 --> 1:01:56.560
 is a really good way to study.

1:01:56.560 --> 1:01:59.320
 Rather than looking through lots of material,

1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:02.480
 it's always like giving yourself lots of tests

1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:05.360
 is a good way to actually deeply understand things

1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:07.560
 and know what you do and you don't understand.

1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:11.320
 So would the questions be in the form of

1:02:11.320 --> 1:02:12.960
 the material you're reviewing

1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:14.440
 is the answer to that question?

1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:16.040
 Or is it almost like beyond,

1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:18.880
 it's the polygon thing they mentioned for a square.

1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:22.760
 Is it almost like, I wonder what is the bigger picture?

1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:26.200
 I was kind of asking like, how is this extended and so on?

1:02:26.200 --> 1:02:28.680
 Yeah, that would be great.

1:02:28.680 --> 1:02:30.200
 And it's a similar,

1:02:30.200 --> 1:02:32.480
 I mean, a question I get asked a lot is about homework.

1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:34.960
 What is a good thing for kids to do for homework?

1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:36.960
 And one of the recommendations I give

1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:41.960
 is to not have kids just do lots of questions for homework,

1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:46.080
 but to actually ask them to reflect on what they've learned.

1:02:46.080 --> 1:02:49.680
 Like, what was the big idea you learned today?

1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:51.880
 Or what did you find difficult?

1:02:51.880 --> 1:02:53.480
 What did you struggle with?

1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:56.480
 What was something that was exciting?

1:02:58.160 --> 1:03:01.120
 Then kids go home and they have to kind of reflect

1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:02.440
 in a deeper way.

1:03:02.440 --> 1:03:04.520
 A lot of times, I don't know if you had this experience

1:03:04.520 --> 1:03:06.640
 as a math student, lots of people do.

1:03:06.640 --> 1:03:08.800
 Kids are going through math questions,

1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:10.920
 they're successful, they get them right,

1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:13.960
 but they don't even really know what they're about.

1:03:13.960 --> 1:03:17.160
 And a lot of kids go through many years of maths like that,

1:03:17.160 --> 1:03:18.200
 doing lots of questions,

1:03:18.200 --> 1:03:21.960
 but that really knowing what even the topic is

1:03:21.960 --> 1:03:24.400
 or what it's about, what it's important for.

1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:28.760
 So having students go back and think at the end of a day,

1:03:28.760 --> 1:03:31.640
 what was the big idea from this maths lesson?

1:03:31.640 --> 1:03:33.320
 Why is it important?

1:03:33.320 --> 1:03:36.040
 Where would I find that in real life?

1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:37.920
 Those are really good questions

1:03:37.920 --> 1:03:39.920
 for kids to be thinking about.

1:03:39.920 --> 1:03:42.400
 It's probably for everybody to be thinking about.

1:03:42.400 --> 1:03:44.320
 I think most of us go through life

1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:48.160
 never asking the bigger question,

1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:51.600
 always those layers of why questions

1:03:51.600 --> 1:03:54.160
 that kids ask when they're very young.

1:03:54.160 --> 1:03:55.960
 We need to keep doing that.

1:03:55.960 --> 1:03:59.680
 Like whatever the term is,

1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:01.400
 you call first principles thinking,

1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:03.320
 some people call it that,

1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:08.320
 which is like, why are we doing it this way?

1:04:08.560 --> 1:04:11.760
 So one nice thing is to do that

1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:13.360
 because there's usually a good answer.

1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:15.360
 The reason we did it this way

1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:17.760
 is because it works for this reason.

1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:20.960
 But then if you want to do something totally novel,

1:04:20.960 --> 1:04:24.200
 you'll say, well, we've been doing it this way

1:04:26.320 --> 1:04:28.600
 because of historical reasons,

1:04:28.600 --> 1:04:30.520
 but really this is not the best way to do it.

1:04:30.520 --> 1:04:32.240
 There might be other ways.

1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:34.440
 And that's how invention happens.

1:04:34.440 --> 1:04:36.480
 And then you get, that's really useful

1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:40.440
 in every aspect of life, like choosing your career,

1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:44.800
 choosing your, I don't know, where you live,

1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:47.760
 who your romantic partner is, like everything.

1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:48.960
 Everything, yeah.

1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:53.200
 And I think it probably starts doing that in math class.

1:04:54.240 --> 1:04:56.280
 That would be good if we started doing that.

1:04:56.280 --> 1:05:00.960
 I mean, I wonder, I probably didn't do very much of that

1:05:00.960 --> 1:05:03.760
 for most of my education, asking why,

1:05:03.760 --> 1:05:08.160
 except for later, much later in the subjects

1:05:08.160 --> 1:05:12.240
 on grad school when you're doing research on them.

1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:15.080
 When you're first tasked with doing something novel

1:05:15.080 --> 1:05:18.040
 using this or solving a problem

1:05:18.040 --> 1:05:19.960
 really outside the classroom,

1:05:19.960 --> 1:05:20.800
 they have to publish on it.

1:05:20.800 --> 1:05:22.560
 It's the first time you think,

1:05:22.560 --> 1:05:27.040
 wait, why are these things interesting, useful?

1:05:27.040 --> 1:05:29.440
 Which are the things that are useful?

1:05:29.440 --> 1:05:31.680
 And yeah, I guess that would be nice

1:05:31.680 --> 1:05:35.240
 if we did that much earlier, the quest of invention.

1:05:35.240 --> 1:05:39.680
 Yeah, yeah, I mean, one of the sad pieces of research data

1:05:39.680 --> 1:05:44.680
 I think about is the questions kids ask in school goes down

1:05:45.800 --> 1:05:50.800
 like in a linear progression from, in the early years,

1:05:51.400 --> 1:05:53.800
 you can't stop kids asking those questions,

1:05:53.800 --> 1:05:56.720
 but they learn not to ask the questions.

1:05:56.720 --> 1:06:00.000
 I think you told somewhere about an early memory

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:04.680
 you had in your own education where you asked the question,

1:06:04.680 --> 1:06:06.280
 or maybe that was an example you gave,

1:06:06.280 --> 1:06:07.440
 but it was shut down.

1:06:07.440 --> 1:06:08.920
 Oh, yeah.

1:06:08.920 --> 1:06:11.080
 You've listened to something I said, yeah.

1:06:12.160 --> 1:06:15.200
 I don't remember where it was, but it caught me.

1:06:15.200 --> 1:06:17.680
 Yeah, I remember it really vividly.

1:06:17.680 --> 1:06:19.840
 Or can you tell the memory?

1:06:19.840 --> 1:06:21.800
 Yeah, I was, it's funny, I can remember.

1:06:21.800 --> 1:06:23.960
 It must've really impacted me in that moment

1:06:23.960 --> 1:06:26.320
 because you know how there's lots of hours of school

1:06:26.320 --> 1:06:29.040
 you don't remember at all, but anyway,

1:06:29.040 --> 1:06:30.720
 I can remember where I was sitting and everything.

1:06:30.720 --> 1:06:33.360
 I was in a high school maths class,

1:06:33.360 --> 1:06:35.280
 although they don't call it that in England,

1:06:35.280 --> 1:06:39.040
 and the teacher said,

1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:41.960
 and it was like the first class of this teacher's class,

1:06:41.960 --> 1:06:44.360
 and he said, ask if you have any questions.

1:06:44.360 --> 1:06:46.840
 So at one point I put my hand up and I said,

1:06:46.840 --> 1:06:49.240
 I have a question, and he said something like,

1:06:49.240 --> 1:06:50.480
 that's your question?

1:06:53.840 --> 1:06:55.400
 And I was like, oh, okay,

1:06:55.400 --> 1:06:57.400
 I'm not asking any more questions in this class.

1:06:57.400 --> 1:06:59.960
 And that hit hard in a way where you didn't wanna,

1:06:59.960 --> 1:07:02.040
 the lesson you learn from that is I'm not gonna ask.

1:07:02.040 --> 1:07:06.320
 Yeah, that was absolutely the last question I'm asking.

1:07:06.320 --> 1:07:11.320
 And that was, yeah, he was the chair of the maths department.

1:07:12.040 --> 1:07:13.720
 I remember that really well.

1:07:13.720 --> 1:07:18.080
 So maybe because of that experience,

1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:20.400
 one of the things we encourage when we teach kids

1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:23.040
 is asking questions, and we value it when they ask questions

1:07:23.040 --> 1:07:25.720
 and we put them up on walls and celebrate.

1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:31.400
 It's funny because I wish there was a feedback signal

1:07:31.400 --> 1:07:35.040
 because he probably, to put a positive spin on it,

1:07:35.040 --> 1:07:37.440
 he probably didn't realize the negative impact

1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:38.720
 he's had in that moment, right?

1:07:38.720 --> 1:07:41.160
 If he only knew, see, this is probably

1:07:41.160 --> 1:07:44.120
 when you're more mature in grad school.

1:07:44.120 --> 1:07:46.960
 I had an amazing professor named Ali Shakafande

1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:49.960
 in computer science, and he would get,

1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:51.240
 he would encourage questions,

1:07:51.240 --> 1:07:52.440
 but then he would tell everybody

1:07:52.440 --> 1:07:54.280
 how dumb their questions are.

1:07:54.280 --> 1:07:57.360
 But it was done, I guess if you show,

1:07:57.360 --> 1:08:00.760
 if you say it with love and respect behind it,

1:08:00.760 --> 1:08:03.720
 then it's more like a friendly, humorous encouragement

1:08:03.720 --> 1:08:05.080
 for more questions.

1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:07.880
 Yeah, it's an art, right, to do it, to write.

1:08:07.880 --> 1:08:10.200
 And then you have to time it right

1:08:10.200 --> 1:08:13.080
 because that kind of humor is probably better

1:08:13.080 --> 1:08:15.440
 for when you're in grad school

1:08:15.440 --> 1:08:18.000
 versus when you're in the early education.

1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:18.840
 Right.

1:08:18.840 --> 1:08:22.320
 Well, and I guess kids or young people get

1:08:22.320 --> 1:08:27.320
 whether somebody's doing it to be funny or, you know,

1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:31.160
 I mean, this is why teaching is so hard.

1:08:31.160 --> 1:08:35.120
 Even your tone can be impactful.

1:08:35.120 --> 1:08:39.680
 It's so sad because for that particular human,

1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:42.760
 the teacher, you just had a bad day,

1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:45.920
 and one statement can have a profound negative impact.

1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:50.120
 I know, sadly, that there's a lot of maths teachers

1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:51.960
 who have that kind of approach,

1:08:51.960 --> 1:08:56.000
 and I think they're suffering from the fact

1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:58.200
 that they think people are math people, not math people,

1:08:58.200 --> 1:09:01.040
 and that comes across in their teaching.

1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:03.400
 But on the flip side, one positive statement.

1:09:03.400 --> 1:09:04.240
 Yeah.

1:09:04.240 --> 1:09:05.080
 Keep them going.

1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:05.920
 That's right.

1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:07.240
 That is the flip side of that.

1:09:07.240 --> 1:09:11.320
 And I myself had one teacher who was really amazing

1:09:11.320 --> 1:09:14.840
 for me in maths, and she kept me in the subject.

1:09:14.840 --> 1:09:16.320
 I probably wouldn't have left it.

1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:17.160
 Who was she?

1:09:17.160 --> 1:09:20.840
 She was, her name was Mrs. Marshall.

1:09:20.840 --> 1:09:25.840
 And she was my A level maths teacher.

1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:30.080
 So I was in England.

1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:32.040
 You do lots of subjects till you're 16,

1:09:32.040 --> 1:09:35.320
 and then you choose like three or four subjects.

1:09:35.320 --> 1:09:40.320
 So I had chosen maths, and you go to higher levels,

1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:44.640
 probably equivalent more to a master's degree in the US

1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:46.160
 because you're more specialized.

1:09:46.160 --> 1:09:48.720
 But anyways, she was my teacher,

1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:52.680
 and for the first time in my whole career in maths,

1:09:52.680 --> 1:09:54.320
 she would give us problems

1:09:54.320 --> 1:09:58.000
 and tell us to talk about them with each other.

1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:01.000
 And so here I was sitting there at like 17,

1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:04.000
 talking with friends about how to solve a math problem,

1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:04.840
 and that was it.

1:10:04.840 --> 1:10:07.800
 That was the change that she made,

1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:10.000
 but it was profound for me

1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:13.360
 because like those calculus students,

1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:16.200
 I started to hear other people's ways of thinking

1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:17.920
 and seeing it, and we would talk together

1:10:17.920 --> 1:10:19.840
 and come up with solutions.

1:10:19.840 --> 1:10:20.680
 And I was like, that was it.

1:10:20.680 --> 1:10:22.040
 That changed maths for me.

1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:25.520
 It wasn't some kind of personal interaction with her.

1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:29.200
 It was more like she was the catalyst

1:10:29.200 --> 1:10:32.040
 for that collaborative experience.

1:10:32.040 --> 1:10:34.960
 I mean, yeah, the many ways teachers can inspire kids.

1:10:34.960 --> 1:10:36.920
 I mean, sometimes it's a personal message,

1:10:36.920 --> 1:10:39.840
 but it can be your teaching approach

1:10:39.840 --> 1:10:42.400
 that changes maths for kids.

1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:47.400
 You know, Cal Newport, he wrote a book called Deep Work,

1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:51.480
 and he's a mathematician, a theoretical computer scientist,

1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:55.720
 and he talks about the kind of the focus required

1:10:55.720 --> 1:10:57.120
 to do that kind of work.

1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:01.760
 Is there something you can comment on?

1:11:01.760 --> 1:11:04.920
 You know, we live in a world full of distractions.

1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:08.400
 That seems like one of the elements that makes studying,

1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:10.280
 and especially the studying of subjects

1:11:10.280 --> 1:11:14.480
 that require thinking like maths does, difficult.

1:11:14.480 --> 1:11:17.400
 Is there something from a student perspective,

1:11:17.400 --> 1:11:20.640
 from a teacher perspective that encourages deep work

1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:21.480
 that you can comment on?

1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:26.480
 Yeah, I think giving kids really inspiring deep problems,

1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:31.440
 and we have some on our website,

1:11:31.440 --> 1:11:33.920
 is a really important experience for them.

1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:38.200
 Even if they only do it occasionally,

1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:40.080
 but it's really important.

1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:44.360
 They actually realise, I do, I give a problem out often

1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:47.040
 when I'm working with teachers, and I say to them,

1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:49.800
 all right, I'm gonna check in with you after an hour.

1:11:49.800 --> 1:11:51.480
 And they're like, an hour?

1:11:51.480 --> 1:11:53.520
 They think it's shocking.

1:11:53.520 --> 1:11:55.400
 And then they work on this problem,

1:11:55.400 --> 1:11:57.880
 and after an hour, I say, okay, how are we doing?

1:11:57.880 --> 1:11:59.520
 They're like, an hour's gone by?

1:12:00.600 --> 1:12:02.000
 How is this possible?

1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:07.000
 And so everybody needs those like rich deep problems.

1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:10.680
 Most kids go through their whole maths experience

1:12:10.680 --> 1:12:14.880
 of however many years, never once working on a problem

1:12:14.880 --> 1:12:16.680
 in that kind of deep way.

1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:21.680
 So the undergrad class I teach at Stanford, we do that.

1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:25.160
 We work on these deep problems every session.

1:12:25.160 --> 1:12:27.200
 And the students come away going, okay,

1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:30.120
 I never wanna go back to that maths relationship I had

1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:32.000
 where it was just all about quick answers.

1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:34.520
 I just don't wanna go back to that.

1:12:34.520 --> 1:12:39.520
 And so we can all, all teachers can incorporate

1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:41.280
 those problems in their classrooms.

1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:42.560
 Maybe they don't do them every day,

1:12:42.560 --> 1:12:46.080
 but they at least give kids some experience

1:12:46.080 --> 1:12:49.760
 of being able to work slowly and deeply

1:12:49.760 --> 1:12:54.760
 and to go to deeper places and not be told

1:12:55.680 --> 1:12:58.680
 they've got five minutes to finish 20 questions.

1:12:58.680 --> 1:13:02.720
 Well, part of it is also just the exercise

1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:05.320
 of sitting there and maintaining focus

1:13:05.320 --> 1:13:07.040
 for prolonged periods of time.

1:13:07.040 --> 1:13:11.960
 That's not often, I mean, that's a skill.

1:13:11.960 --> 1:13:16.000
 It's a skill that also could be discouraging.

1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:18.120
 Like if you don't practice it,

1:13:18.120 --> 1:13:20.520
 just sitting down for 10 minutes straight

1:13:20.520 --> 1:13:23.480
 and maintaining deep focus could be exceptionally challenging.

1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:26.600
 Like if you're really thinking about a problem

1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:29.240
 and I think it's really important to realize

1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:31.880
 that that's a skill that you can just like a muscle,

1:13:31.880 --> 1:13:33.520
 you can build, you can start with five minutes

1:13:33.520 --> 1:13:36.680
 and goes to 10 minutes to 30 and to an hour.

1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:39.000
 And to be successful, I think in certain subjects

1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:42.520
 like mathematics, you wanna be able to develop that skill.

1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:46.640
 Otherwise you're not going to get

1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:49.680
 to the really rewarding experience

1:13:49.680 --> 1:13:51.320
 of solving these problems.

1:13:52.400 --> 1:13:53.520
 Definitely.

1:13:53.520 --> 1:13:55.880
 There was a survey done of kids in school

1:13:55.880 --> 1:13:57.480
 where they were asked, how long will you work

1:13:57.480 --> 1:13:59.000
 on a maths problem before you give up

1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:02.440
 and decide it's not possible to solve it?

1:14:02.440 --> 1:14:06.720
 And the result on average across the kids was two minutes.

1:14:10.720 --> 1:14:15.360
 Yeah, that's a bad sign, but that was a powerful sign

1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:19.480
 that they need to learn to not give up so quickly.

1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:22.760
 Yeah, we mentioned offline

1:14:22.760 --> 1:14:25.520
 because we've been talking so much about visualization,

1:14:25.520 --> 1:14:29.200
 Grant Sanderson, Three Blue One Brown.

1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:32.040
 So he's inspired millions of people

1:14:32.040 --> 1:14:35.480
 with exactly the kind of way of thinking

1:14:35.480 --> 1:14:36.640
 that you've been talking about.

1:14:36.640 --> 1:14:38.960
 Yeah, I love his work.

1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:42.680
 Converting sort of mathematical concepts

1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:47.680
 into visual, like visually representing them,

1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:51.000
 exploring them in ways that help you illuminate

1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:52.160
 like the concepts.

1:14:53.280 --> 1:14:55.040
 What do you think is the role of that?

1:14:55.040 --> 1:14:58.000
 So he uses mostly programmatic visualization.

1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:01.320
 So it's the thing I mentioned where there's like animations

1:15:01.320 --> 1:15:04.520
 created by writing computer programs.

1:15:05.560 --> 1:15:08.440
 Like what do you think, how scalable is that approach?

1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:10.480
 But in general, what do you think about his approach?

1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:11.880
 I think it's amazing.

1:15:11.880 --> 1:15:13.200
 I should work with him.

1:15:14.680 --> 1:15:17.040
 I can share some of our visuals

1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:19.600
 and he can make them in that amazing way.

1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:23.040
 So part of his storytelling,

1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:26.360
 part of it is creating the visuals

1:15:26.360 --> 1:15:29.400
 and then weaving a story with those visuals

1:15:29.400 --> 1:15:32.080
 that kind of builds, like there's also,

1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:34.960
 I mean, there's also drama in it.

1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:36.520
 You start with a small example

1:15:36.520 --> 1:15:39.560
 and then you kind of, all of a sudden there's a surprise.

1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:41.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:15:41.080 --> 1:15:43.440
 And it really, I mean, it makes you fall in love

1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:45.560
 with the concept.

1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:47.040
 He does talk about that.

1:15:48.440 --> 1:15:50.800
 His sense is like some of the stuff,

1:15:50.800 --> 1:15:55.800
 he doesn't feel like he's teaching like the core curriculum,

1:15:57.320 --> 1:16:01.000
 which is something, he sees himself

1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.600
 as an inspirational figure.

1:16:03.600 --> 1:16:05.760
 But because I think it's too difficult

1:16:05.760 --> 1:16:09.600
 to kind of convert all of the curriculum into those elements.

1:16:09.600 --> 1:16:11.000
 And probably you don't need to.

1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:15.920
 I mean, if people get to experience mathematical ideas

1:16:15.920 --> 1:16:20.000
 in the way that he shares them, that will change them.

1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:21.600
 And it will change the way they think.

1:16:21.600 --> 1:16:22.840
 And maybe they could go on

1:16:22.840 --> 1:16:25.040
 to take some other mathematical idea

1:16:25.040 --> 1:16:26.320
 and make it that beautiful.

1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:27.320
 Well, he does that.

1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:32.920
 He created a library called Manim and he open sourced it.

1:16:32.920 --> 1:16:36.400
 And that library is the, people should check it out.

1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:39.520
 It's written in Python

1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:41.960
 and it uses some of those same elements.

1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:44.040
 Like it allows you to animate equations

1:16:44.040 --> 1:16:45.640
 and animate little shapes.

1:16:45.640 --> 1:16:47.600
 Like people that, you know,

1:16:47.600 --> 1:16:50.320
 he has a very distinct style in his videos

1:16:50.320 --> 1:16:51.640
 and what that resulted in,

1:16:51.640 --> 1:16:54.160
 even though from a software engineer perspective,

1:16:54.160 --> 1:16:57.760
 the code he released is not like super well documented

1:16:57.760 --> 1:17:00.440
 or perfect, but him releasing that,

1:17:01.760 --> 1:17:05.200
 now there's all of these people educating it.

1:17:05.200 --> 1:17:06.800
 And the cool, to me personally,

1:17:06.800 --> 1:17:11.120
 the coolest thing is to see like people they're not,

1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:13.760
 you know, don't have like a million subscribers

1:17:13.760 --> 1:17:17.440
 or something is they have just a few views in the video,

1:17:17.440 --> 1:17:21.520
 but it just seems like the process of them

1:17:21.520 --> 1:17:24.360
 creating a video where they teach

1:17:24.360 --> 1:17:27.200
 is like transformative to them from a student perspective.

1:17:27.200 --> 1:17:28.360
 It's the old Feynman thing,

1:17:28.360 --> 1:17:30.280
 the best way to learn is to teach.

1:17:30.280 --> 1:17:32.680
 And then him releasing that into the wild is,

1:17:33.720 --> 1:17:35.800
 it shows that that impact.

1:17:35.800 --> 1:17:37.480
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:17:37.480 --> 1:17:39.840
 I think just giving people that idea

1:17:39.840 --> 1:17:42.920
 that you can do that with maths and other subjects,

1:17:42.920 --> 1:17:45.680
 there's bound to be people all around

1:17:45.680 --> 1:17:48.720
 who can create more, which is cool.

1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:49.640
 Yeah, definitely.

1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:52.600
 So I recommend that people do like JavaScript or Python.

1:17:52.600 --> 1:17:56.400
 You can build like visualizations of most concepts

1:17:56.400 --> 1:17:57.720
 in high school math.

1:17:57.720 --> 1:18:00.000
 You can do a lot of kinds of visualizations

1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:01.480
 and doing that yourself.

1:18:01.480 --> 1:18:04.360
 Plus, if you do that yourself, people will really love it.

1:18:04.360 --> 1:18:09.240
 People actually, people love visualizations of math.

1:18:09.240 --> 1:18:11.160
 Cause they, I mean, it's something in us

1:18:11.160 --> 1:18:14.280
 that loves patterns, loves figuring out difficult things

1:18:14.280 --> 1:18:19.000
 and the patterns in there then are unexpected in some way.

1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:19.840
 Yeah.

1:18:19.840 --> 1:18:22.040
 Have you ever noticed that hotels

1:18:22.040 --> 1:18:24.240
 are always filled with patterns?

1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:26.360
 I was just noticing at the hotel I'm in now,

1:18:26.360 --> 1:18:28.720
 all of their carpets are pattern carpets

1:18:28.720 --> 1:18:30.920
 and then they have patterns on the walls.

1:18:30.920 --> 1:18:31.760
 Yeah.

1:18:31.760 --> 1:18:33.080
 So, yeah.

1:18:33.080 --> 1:18:36.440
 We humans love the symmetry and patterns,

1:18:36.440 --> 1:18:38.840
 the breaking of symmetry and patterns.

1:18:38.840 --> 1:18:39.920
 Yeah.

1:18:39.920 --> 1:18:42.880
 And then it's funny that we don't see mathematics

1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:45.960
 as somehow intricately connected to that, but it is, right?

1:18:45.960 --> 1:18:47.360
 I mean, that's one of the perspectives

1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:51.040
 that I love students to take is to be a pattern seeker.

1:18:51.040 --> 1:18:51.880
 In everything.

1:18:51.880 --> 1:18:53.840
 In, yeah, certainly in all of maths.

1:18:53.840 --> 1:18:55.320
 I mean, you can think of all of maths

1:18:55.320 --> 1:18:57.160
 as a kind of subject of patterns

1:18:57.160 --> 1:19:01.600
 and not just visual patterns, but, you know,

1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:05.720
 when you think about multiplying by five

1:19:05.720 --> 1:19:08.120
 and the fact you can, you know,

1:19:08.120 --> 1:19:11.280
 if you're multiplying 18 times five,

1:19:11.280 --> 1:19:13.800
 you can instead think of nine times 10.

1:19:14.680 --> 1:19:17.240
 That's a pattern that always works in mathematics.

1:19:17.240 --> 1:19:19.080
 You can halve a number and double a number.

1:19:19.080 --> 1:19:21.320
 And so, yeah, I just think there are patterns everywhere.

1:19:21.320 --> 1:19:24.760
 And if kids are thinking their role is to see patterns

1:19:24.760 --> 1:19:28.440
 and find patterns, it's really exciting.

1:19:28.440 --> 1:19:31.960
 What do you think about like MIT OpenCourseWare

1:19:31.960 --> 1:19:36.280
 and the release of lectures by universities?

1:19:36.280 --> 1:19:37.880
 I think it's good.

1:19:37.880 --> 1:19:38.720
 I think it's good.

1:19:38.720 --> 1:19:43.720
 I think that is what started the MOOC I did

1:19:43.800 --> 1:19:46.040
 was using that platform.

1:19:46.040 --> 1:19:48.720
 So you ultimately think like the Udacity models

1:19:48.720 --> 1:19:50.440
 is a little bit more effective

1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:52.440
 than just a plain two hour lecture.

1:19:52.440 --> 1:19:53.600
 I think there's definitely,

1:19:53.600 --> 1:19:57.000
 you can bring in good pedagogy into online learning.

1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:59.560
 And I think the idea of putting things online

1:19:59.560 --> 1:20:02.720
 so that people all over the world can access them is great.

1:20:02.720 --> 1:20:06.000
 I don't think the initial excitement around MOOCs

1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:08.280
 sort of democratizing education

1:20:08.280 --> 1:20:11.840
 and make it more equal came about

1:20:11.840 --> 1:20:14.040
 because they found that the people taking MOOCs

1:20:14.040 --> 1:20:17.000
 tended to be the more privileged people.

1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:20.880
 So that was, I think there's still something to be found

1:20:20.880 --> 1:20:22.800
 in that there's still more to be done

1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:27.640
 to help that online learning reach those principles.

1:20:27.640 --> 1:20:31.800
 But definitely, I think it's a good invention.

1:20:31.800 --> 1:20:35.080
 And I have an online class that's for kids,

1:20:35.080 --> 1:20:36.960
 that's a little free class that gives them.

1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:37.960
 What's the topic?

1:20:37.960 --> 1:20:39.480
 It's called How to Learn Maths.

1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:41.680
 How to Learn Maths.

1:20:41.680 --> 1:20:44.360
 It shows maths as this visual creative subject

1:20:44.360 --> 1:20:47.080
 and it shares mindset and some brain science

1:20:47.080 --> 1:20:51.200
 and kids who take it do better in maths class.

1:20:51.200 --> 1:20:54.160
 We've studied it with like randomized controlled trials

1:20:54.160 --> 1:20:57.240
 and given it to middle school kids

1:20:57.240 --> 1:21:00.000
 and other middle school kids who don't take it

1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:01.320
 but are taught by the same teachers.

1:21:01.320 --> 1:21:02.920
 So their teachers are the same.

1:21:02.920 --> 1:21:04.840
 And the kids who take the online class

1:21:04.840 --> 1:21:08.680
 end up 68% more engaged in their maths class

1:21:08.680 --> 1:21:10.480
 and do better at the end of the year.

1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:15.080
 So that's a little six session, 15 minute class

1:21:15.080 --> 1:21:18.920
 and it changes kids maths relationships.

1:21:18.920 --> 1:21:23.920
 So it is true that we can do that with some words

1:21:24.840 --> 1:21:29.440
 that aren't, it's not a huge change to the education system.

1:21:30.320 --> 1:21:33.120
 Do you have advice for young people?

1:21:33.120 --> 1:21:35.920
 We've been talking about mathematics quite a bit

1:21:35.920 --> 1:21:39.200
 but in terms of their journey through education,

1:21:39.200 --> 1:21:41.760
 through their career choices, through life,

1:21:41.760 --> 1:21:46.040
 maybe middle school, high school, undergrad students,

1:21:46.040 --> 1:21:48.680
 of how to live a life they can be proud of?

1:21:50.520 --> 1:21:54.160
 I think if I were to give advice to people,

1:21:54.160 --> 1:21:59.160
 especially young people, my advice would be to always,

1:21:59.400 --> 1:22:00.440
 it sounds really corny,

1:22:00.440 --> 1:22:03.360
 but always believe in yourself

1:22:03.360 --> 1:22:05.240
 and know that you can achieve

1:22:05.240 --> 1:22:07.880
 because although that sounds like obvious,

1:22:07.880 --> 1:22:10.320
 of course we want kids to know that they can achieve things.

1:22:10.320 --> 1:22:13.760
 I know that millions of kids who are in the school system

1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:17.160
 have been given the message, they cannot do things.

1:22:17.160 --> 1:22:20.520
 And adults too, they have the idea,

1:22:20.520 --> 1:22:23.200
 oh, I did okay in this, I went into this job

1:22:23.200 --> 1:22:26.840
 because those other things I could never have done okay in.

1:22:26.840 --> 1:22:28.480
 So actually when they hear,

1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:31.440
 hey, maybe you could do those other things.

1:22:31.440 --> 1:22:34.960
 Even adults think, maybe I can.

1:22:34.960 --> 1:22:38.000
 And they go back and they encounter this knowledge

1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:40.680
 and they relearn things and they change careers

1:22:40.680 --> 1:22:42.560
 and amazing things happen.

1:22:42.560 --> 1:22:45.840
 So for me, I think that message is really important.

1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:47.680
 You can learn anything.

1:22:47.680 --> 1:22:50.040
 Scientists try and find a limit.

1:22:50.040 --> 1:22:51.120
 They're always trying to find a limit,

1:22:51.120 --> 1:22:52.400
 like how much can you really learn?

1:22:52.400 --> 1:22:54.160
 What's the limit to how much you can learn?

1:22:54.160 --> 1:22:56.400
 And they always come away not being able to find it.

1:22:56.400 --> 1:22:59.400
 People can just go further and further and further.

1:22:59.400 --> 1:23:03.000
 And that is true of people born with brain,

1:23:04.400 --> 1:23:06.280
 areas of their brain that aren't functioning well

1:23:06.280 --> 1:23:08.640
 that have what we call special needs.

1:23:08.640 --> 1:23:10.880
 Some of those people also go on to develop

1:23:10.880 --> 1:23:12.680
 and do amazing things.

1:23:12.680 --> 1:23:17.280
 So I think that really experiencing that,

1:23:17.280 --> 1:23:19.440
 knowing that feeling, not just saying it,

1:23:19.440 --> 1:23:24.080
 but knowing it deeply, you can learn anything

1:23:24.080 --> 1:23:28.600
 is something I wish all people would have.

1:23:28.600 --> 1:23:30.600
 Actually also applies when you've achieved

1:23:30.600 --> 1:23:32.400
 some level of success too.

1:23:32.400 --> 1:23:36.240
 What I find, like in my life with people that love me,

1:23:36.240 --> 1:23:37.840
 when you achieve success,

1:23:37.840 --> 1:23:40.280
 they keep celebrating your success

1:23:40.280 --> 1:23:42.640
 and they want you to keep doing the thing

1:23:42.640 --> 1:23:44.960
 that you were successful at,

1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:49.080
 as opposed to believing in that you can do something else,

1:23:49.080 --> 1:23:51.560
 something big, whatever your heart says to do.

1:23:51.560 --> 1:23:54.880
 And one of the things that I realized the value of this,

1:23:57.760 --> 1:24:00.400
 quite recently, which is sad to say,

1:24:00.400 --> 1:24:03.160
 is how important it is to seek out,

1:24:03.160 --> 1:24:04.920
 when you're younger, to seek out mentors,

1:24:04.920 --> 1:24:07.520
 to seek out the people,

1:24:07.520 --> 1:24:10.680
 surround yourself with people that will believe in you.

1:24:10.680 --> 1:24:14.040
 It's like a little bit is on you.

1:24:14.040 --> 1:24:18.200
 It's like, you don't get that sometimes

1:24:18.200 --> 1:24:20.080
 if you go to grad school,

1:24:20.080 --> 1:24:22.240
 you think you kind of land on a mentor,

1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:24.440
 maybe you pick a mentor based on the topic

1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:25.680
 they're interested in.

1:24:25.680 --> 1:24:28.960
 But the reality is the people you surround yourself with,

1:24:28.960 --> 1:24:32.400
 they're going to define your life trajectory.

1:24:32.400 --> 1:24:35.480
 So select people that believe in you.

1:24:35.480 --> 1:24:38.640
 And get away from people who don't believe in you.

1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:41.840
 Sometimes parents can be that, they can love you deeply,

1:24:41.840 --> 1:24:46.280
 but they set, it's the math thing we mentioned,

1:24:46.280 --> 1:24:50.120
 they might set certain constraints on the beliefs

1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:50.960
 that you have.

1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:55.080
 And so in that, if you're interested in mathematics,

1:24:55.080 --> 1:24:56.800
 and your parents are not that interested in it,

1:24:56.800 --> 1:24:59.600
 don't listen to your parents on that one dimension.

1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:00.800
 Exactly.

1:25:00.800 --> 1:25:02.880
 Yeah, and if people tell you you can't do things,

1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:06.640
 you have to hear from other people who believe in you.

1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:09.200
 I think you're absolutely right about that.

1:25:09.200 --> 1:25:11.280
 So sad the number of people who've had

1:25:11.280 --> 1:25:14.040
 those negative messages from parents.

1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:16.840
 In my Limitless Mind book, I interviewed quite a few people

1:25:16.840 --> 1:25:18.520
 who'd been told they couldn't do math,

1:25:18.520 --> 1:25:21.720
 sometimes by parents, sometimes by teachers.

1:25:21.720 --> 1:25:24.880
 And fortunately, they had got other ideas

1:25:24.880 --> 1:25:26.040
 at some point in their life,

1:25:26.040 --> 1:25:28.520
 and realized there was this whole world

1:25:28.520 --> 1:25:32.240
 of mathematical thinking that was open to them.

1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:37.240
 So it's really important that people do connect

1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:39.120
 with people who believe in them,

1:25:39.120 --> 1:25:41.920
 however hard that might be to find those people.

1:25:41.920 --> 1:25:44.880
 What do you hope the education system,

1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:48.000
 education in general, looks like 10, 20, 50,

1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:49.640
 100 years from now?

1:25:49.640 --> 1:25:51.720
 Are you optimistic about this future?

1:25:51.720 --> 1:25:53.080
 Yeah, I definitely have hope.

1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:56.600
 There is, change can happen in the education system.

1:25:56.600 --> 1:26:00.600
 In recent years, it's been microscopically slow.

1:26:03.320 --> 1:26:07.320
 But I do actually see change happening.

1:26:07.320 --> 1:26:10.840
 We were talking earlier that data science is now

1:26:10.840 --> 1:26:14.280
 a course you can take in high school instead of algebra two.

1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:17.640
 And that's pretty amazing because that content

1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:22.080
 was set out in 1892 and hasn't changed since then.

1:26:22.080 --> 1:26:25.120
 And so now we're actually seeing a change

1:26:25.120 --> 1:26:26.880
 in the content of high school.

1:26:26.880 --> 1:26:29.480
 So I'm amazed that that's happening

1:26:29.480 --> 1:26:31.280
 and very happy it's happening.

1:26:31.280 --> 1:26:33.960
 So change is very slow in education usually,

1:26:33.960 --> 1:26:38.960
 but when you look ahead and think about all that we know,

1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:42.960
 and all that we can offer kids in terms of technology,

1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:46.960
 you've got to think that 100 years from now,

1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:50.960
 education will be totally different to the way it is now.

1:26:50.960 --> 1:26:54.400
 Maybe we won't have subject boundaries anymore

1:26:54.400 --> 1:26:57.400
 because those don't really make much sense.

1:26:57.400 --> 1:27:00.880
 And it's interesting to think how certain tools

1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:03.960
 like programming, maybe they'll be deeply integrated

1:27:03.960 --> 1:27:04.800
 in everything we do.

1:27:04.800 --> 1:27:07.360
 Yeah, you would think that all kids are growing up

1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:11.040
 learning to program and create.

1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:14.360
 So I just think, I mean, the system of schooling

1:27:14.360 --> 1:27:17.240
 we have now, people call it a factory model.

1:27:17.240 --> 1:27:21.960
 It's not designed to inspire creativity.

1:27:21.960 --> 1:27:25.560
 And I feel like that will also change.

1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:27.360
 People might look back on these days

1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:28.800
 and think they were hilarious,

1:27:28.800 --> 1:27:32.200
 but maybe we'll in the future,

1:27:32.200 --> 1:27:33.600
 kids will be doing their own programming

1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:35.080
 and they'll be able to learn things

1:27:35.080 --> 1:27:37.120
 and find out things and create things

1:27:37.120 --> 1:27:37.960
 even as they're learning.

1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:42.960
 And maybe the individual subject boundaries will go.

1:27:44.320 --> 1:27:47.360
 Data science itself coming into the education system

1:27:47.360 --> 1:27:50.440
 kind of illustrates that because people realize

1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:54.960
 it doesn't really fit inside any of the subjects.

1:27:54.960 --> 1:27:56.280
 So what do we do with it?

1:27:56.280 --> 1:27:59.840
 Where does it go and who teaches it?

1:27:59.840 --> 1:28:03.080
 So it's already raising those kind of questions

1:28:03.080 --> 1:28:07.560
 and questioning how we have these different subject boundaries.

1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:09.320
 So you've seen data science be integrated

1:28:09.320 --> 1:28:10.640
 into the curriculum?

1:28:10.640 --> 1:28:14.080
 Yes, it's happening across the United States as we speak.

1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:15.480
 I wonder how they got initiated.

1:28:15.480 --> 1:28:18.360
 Like how does change happen in the education system?

1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:20.880
 Is it just a few revolutionary leaders?

1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:22.320
 It does, I think so.

1:28:22.320 --> 1:28:23.160
 I think so.

1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:24.520
 It's been an interesting journey

1:28:24.520 --> 1:28:26.600
 seeing data science take off actually.

1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:31.600
 There was a course that was developed in 2014

1:28:32.240 --> 1:28:34.240
 by some people who thought data science

1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:36.640
 was a good idea for high schoolers.

1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:39.480
 And then after some kids took the course

1:28:39.480 --> 1:28:41.320
 and nothing bad happened to them,

1:28:41.320 --> 1:28:46.320
 they went to college and people started to accept it more.

1:28:46.320 --> 1:28:49.480
 And then this was a big piece of the change in California.

1:28:49.480 --> 1:28:52.040
 The UC system communicated.

1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:53.600
 They sent out an email last year,

1:28:53.600 --> 1:28:57.080
 the 50,000 high schools saying, we now accept data science.

1:28:57.080 --> 1:28:59.120
 Kids can take it instead of algebra two.

1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:01.960
 That's a perfectly legitimate college pathway.

1:29:01.960 --> 1:29:05.640
 So that was like a big green light for a lot of schools

1:29:05.640 --> 1:29:08.520
 who were like wondering about whether they could teach it.

1:29:08.520 --> 1:29:12.280
 So I think it happens in small spaces and expands.

1:29:12.280 --> 1:29:13.480
 It goes viral.

1:29:13.480 --> 1:29:14.320
 Yeah.

1:29:14.320 --> 1:29:15.160
 In this modern age.

1:29:15.160 --> 1:29:16.000
 Then it goes viral.

1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:21.000
 California's ahead, I think in creating courses

1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:25.360
 and having kids go through it, but it's suddenly,

1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:27.400
 when I last looked, there were 12 states

1:29:27.400 --> 1:29:29.720
 that were allowing data science as a high school course.

1:29:29.720 --> 1:29:34.720
 And I think by next year, that will have doubled or more.

1:29:35.040 --> 1:29:38.400
 So change is happening.

1:29:38.400 --> 1:29:41.920
 Joe, as I said, I think mathematics

1:29:41.920 --> 1:29:45.120
 is truly a beautiful subject.

1:29:45.120 --> 1:29:48.560
 And you having an impact on millions of people

1:29:48.560 --> 1:29:52.200
 and you having an impact on millions of people's lives

1:29:52.200 --> 1:29:56.160
 by educating them, by inspiring teachers to educate

1:29:56.160 --> 1:29:57.960
 in the ways that you've talked about

1:29:57.960 --> 1:30:01.440
 in multidimensional ways, in visual ways,

1:30:01.440 --> 1:30:02.440
 I think is incredible.

1:30:02.440 --> 1:30:06.040
 So you're spreading beauty into the world.

1:30:06.040 --> 1:30:07.520
 So I really, really appreciate

1:30:07.520 --> 1:30:09.240
 that you spend your valuable time with me today.

1:30:09.240 --> 1:30:10.080
 Thank you for talking.

1:30:10.080 --> 1:30:10.920
 Thank you.

1:30:10.920 --> 1:30:12.560
 It was really good to talk to you.

1:30:12.560 --> 1:30:15.280
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Joe Boller.

 And now let me leave you with some words

1:30:21.400 --> 1:30:23.640
 from Albert Einstein.

1:30:23.640 --> 1:30:27.960
 Pure mathematics is the poetry of logical ideas.

1:30:27.960 --> 1:30:46.960
 Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.
