00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
 The following is a conversation with Ariel Vinales.

00:03.280 --> 00:05.880
 He's a senior research scientist at Google DeepMind,

00:05.880 --> 00:09.120
 and before that, he was at Google Brain and Berkeley.

00:09.120 --> 00:13.280
 His research has been cited over 39,000 times.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.520
 He's truly one of the most brilliant and impactful minds

00:16.520 --> 00:18.160
 in the field of deep learning.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.960
 He's behind some of the biggest papers and ideas in AI,

00:20.960 --> 00:23.080
 including sequence to sequence learning,

00:23.080 --> 00:25.480
 audio generation, image captioning,

00:25.480 --> 00:27.000
 neural machine translation,

00:27.000 --> 00:29.600
 and, of course, reinforcement learning.

00:29.600 --> 00:32.800
 He's a lead researcher of the AlphaStar project,

00:32.800 --> 00:35.760
 creating an agent that defeated a top professional

00:35.760 --> 00:38.080
 at the game of StarCraft.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.800
 This conversation is part

00:39.800 --> 00:41.800
 of the Artificial Intelligence podcast.

00:41.800 --> 00:44.920
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes,

00:44.920 --> 00:48.800
 or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman,

00:48.800 --> 00:51.240
 spelled F R I D.

00:51.240 --> 00:55.440
 And now, here's my conversation with Ariel Vinales.

00:55.440 --> 00:59.600
 You spearheaded the DeepMind team behind AlphaStar

00:59.600 --> 01:02.840
 that recently beat a top professional player at StarCraft.

01:04.040 --> 01:07.720
 So you have an incredible wealth of work

01:07.720 --> 01:09.480
 in deep learning and a bunch of fields,

01:09.480 --> 01:11.840
 but let's talk about StarCraft first.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.760
 Let's go back to the very beginning,

01:13.760 --> 01:16.680
 even before AlphaStar, before DeepMind,

01:16.680 --> 01:18.840
 before deep learning first.

01:18.840 --> 01:21.280
 What came first for you,

01:21.280 --> 01:24.960
 a love for programming or a love for video games?

01:24.960 --> 01:28.560
 I think for me, it definitely came first

01:28.560 --> 01:31.960
 the drive to play video games.

01:31.960 --> 01:35.280
 I really liked computers.

01:35.280 --> 01:38.840
 I didn't really code much, but what I would do is

01:38.840 --> 01:42.080
 I would just mess with the computer, break it and fix it.

01:42.080 --> 01:43.800
 That was the level of skills, I guess,

01:43.800 --> 01:46.400
 that I gained in my very early days,

01:46.400 --> 01:48.520
 I mean, when I was 10 or 11.

01:48.520 --> 01:50.960
 And then I really got into video games,

01:50.960 --> 01:53.680
 especially StarCraft, actually, the first version.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.240
 I spent most of my time

01:55.240 --> 01:57.080
 just playing kind of pseudo professionally,

01:57.080 --> 02:01.040
 as professionally as you could play back in 98 in Europe,

02:01.040 --> 02:03.080
 which was not a very main scene

02:03.080 --> 02:05.840
 like what's called nowadays eSports.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.400
 Right, of course, in the 90s.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.920
 So how'd you get into StarCraft?

02:09.920 --> 02:11.680
 What was your favorite race?

02:11.680 --> 02:15.080
 How did you develop your skill?

02:15.080 --> 02:16.880
 What was your strategy?

02:16.880 --> 02:18.040
 All that kind of thing.

02:18.040 --> 02:21.520
 So as a player, I tended to try to play not many games,

02:21.520 --> 02:23.720
 not to kind of disclose the strategies

02:23.720 --> 02:25.400
 that I kind of developed.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.560
 And I like to play random, actually,

02:27.560 --> 02:30.040
 not in competitions, but just to...

02:30.040 --> 02:33.400
 I think in StarCraft, there's three main races

02:33.400 --> 02:36.280
 and I found it very useful to play with all of them.

02:36.280 --> 02:38.360
 And so I would choose random many times,

02:38.360 --> 02:40.200
 even sometimes in tournaments,

02:40.200 --> 02:42.360
 to gain skill on the three races

02:42.360 --> 02:45.440
 because it's not how you play against someone,

02:45.440 --> 02:48.760
 but also if you understand the race because you played,

02:48.760 --> 02:51.040
 you also understand what's annoying,

02:51.040 --> 02:52.480
 then when you're on the other side,

02:52.480 --> 02:54.160
 what to do to annoy that person,

02:54.160 --> 02:57.280
 to try to gain advantages here and there and so on.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.080
 So I actually played random,

02:59.080 --> 03:02.000
 although I must say in terms of favorite race,

03:02.000 --> 03:03.640
 I really liked Zerg.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.480
 I was probably best at Zerg

03:05.480 --> 03:08.320
 and that's probably what I tend to use

03:08.320 --> 03:11.400
 towards the end of my career before starting university.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.280
 So let's step back a little bit.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.600
 Could you try to describe StarCraft

03:15.600 --> 03:18.880
 to people that may never have played video games,

03:18.880 --> 03:22.280
 especially the massively online variety like StarCraft?

03:22.280 --> 03:25.880
 So StarCraft is a real time strategy game.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.760
 And the way to think about StarCraft,

03:27.760 --> 03:30.920
 perhaps if you understand a bit chess,

03:30.920 --> 03:34.200
 is that there's a board which is called map

03:34.200 --> 03:39.120
 or the map where people play against each other.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.960
 There's obviously many ways you can play,

03:40.960 --> 03:44.600
 but the most interesting one is the one versus one setup

03:44.600 --> 03:47.360
 where you just play against someone else

03:47.360 --> 03:49.280
 or even the built in AI, right?

03:49.280 --> 03:51.600
 Blizzard put a system that can play the game

03:51.600 --> 03:54.480
 reasonably well if you don't know how to play.

03:54.480 --> 03:57.080
 And then in this board, you have again,

03:57.080 --> 03:58.680
 pieces like in chess,

03:58.680 --> 04:01.400
 but these pieces are not there initially

04:01.400 --> 04:02.360
 like they are in chess.

04:02.360 --> 04:05.800
 You actually need to decide to gather resources

04:05.800 --> 04:07.920
 to decide which pieces to build.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.760
 So in a way you're starting almost with no pieces.

04:10.760 --> 04:13.400
 You start gathering resources in StarCraft.

04:13.400 --> 04:16.200
 There's minerals and gas that you can gather.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.440
 And then you must decide how much do you wanna focus

04:19.440 --> 04:21.480
 for instance, on gathering more resources

04:21.480 --> 04:24.360
 or starting to build units or pieces.

04:24.360 --> 04:27.200
 And then once you have enough pieces

04:27.200 --> 04:32.120
 or maybe like attack, a good attack composition,

04:32.120 --> 04:35.480
 then you go and attack the other side of the map.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.800
 And now the other main difference with chess

04:37.800 --> 04:39.920
 is that you don't see the other side of the map.

04:39.920 --> 04:43.360
 So you're not seeing the moves of the enemy.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.440
 It's what we call partially observable.

04:45.440 --> 04:48.680
 So as a result, you must not only decide

04:48.680 --> 04:52.320
 trading off economy versus building your own units,

04:52.320 --> 04:54.960
 but you also must decide whether you wanna scout

04:54.960 --> 04:57.840
 to gather information, but also by scouting,

04:57.840 --> 04:59.520
 you might be giving away some information

04:59.520 --> 05:01.960
 that you might be hiding from the enemy.

05:01.960 --> 05:04.960
 So there's a lot of complex decision making

05:04.960 --> 05:06.000
 all in real time.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.120
 There's also unlike chess, this is not a turn based game.

05:10.120 --> 05:13.680
 You play basically all the time continuously

05:13.680 --> 05:16.280
 and thus some skill in terms of speed

05:16.280 --> 05:18.920
 and accuracy of clicking is also very important.

05:18.920 --> 05:21.480
 And people that train for this really play this game

05:21.480 --> 05:23.560
 at an amazing skill level.

05:23.560 --> 05:25.800
 I've seen many times these

05:25.800 --> 05:27.360
 and if you can witness this life,

05:27.360 --> 05:29.480
 it's really, really impressive.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.400
 So in a way, it's kind of a chess

05:31.400 --> 05:33.400
 where you don't see the other side of the board,

05:33.400 --> 05:35.200
 you're building your own pieces

05:35.200 --> 05:37.200
 and you also need to gather resources

05:37.200 --> 05:40.680
 to basically get some money to build other buildings,

05:40.680 --> 05:42.840
 pieces, technology and so on.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.120
 From the perspective of a human player,

05:45.120 --> 05:47.200
 the difference between that and chess

05:47.200 --> 05:50.760
 or maybe that and a game like turn based strategy

05:50.760 --> 05:55.160
 like Heroes of Might and Magic is that there's an anxiety

05:55.160 --> 05:58.760
 because you have to make these decisions really quickly.

05:58.760 --> 06:03.760
 And if you are not actually aware of what decisions work,

06:04.360 --> 06:06.480
 it's a very stressful balance.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.880
 Everything you describe is actually quite stressful,

06:08.880 --> 06:11.680
 difficult to balance for an amateur human player.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.120
 I don't know if it gets easier at the professional level,

06:14.120 --> 06:16.440
 like if they're fully aware of what they have to do,

06:16.440 --> 06:19.240
 but at the amateur level, there's this anxiety.

06:19.240 --> 06:20.440
 Oh crap, I'm being attacked.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.760
 Oh crap, I have to build up resource.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.320
 Oh, I have to probably expand.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.120
 And all these, the time,

06:26.120 --> 06:29.440
 the real time strategy aspect is really stressful

06:29.440 --> 06:31.320
 and computationally I'm sure difficult.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.240
 We'll get into it.

06:32.240 --> 06:35.960
 But for me, Battle.net,

06:35.960 --> 06:40.960
 so StarCraft was released in 98, 20 years ago,

06:42.600 --> 06:44.640
 which is hard to believe.

06:44.640 --> 06:49.640
 And Blizzard Battle.net with Diablo in 96 came out.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.560
 And to me, it might be a narrow perspective,

06:52.560 --> 06:56.800
 but it changed online gaming and perhaps society forever.

06:56.800 --> 06:57.640
 Yeah.

06:57.640 --> 07:00.280
 But I may have made way too narrow viewpoint,

07:00.280 --> 07:02.200
 but from your perspective,

07:02.200 --> 07:05.040
 can you talk about the history of gaming

07:05.040 --> 07:06.440
 over the past 20 years?

07:06.440 --> 07:09.120
 Is this, how transformational,

07:09.120 --> 07:12.200
 how important is this line of games?

07:12.200 --> 07:16.400
 Right, so I think I kind of was an active gamer

07:16.400 --> 07:20.040
 whilst this was developing, the internet, online gaming.

07:20.040 --> 07:24.800
 So for me, the way it came was I played other games,

07:24.800 --> 07:27.880
 strategy related, I played a bit of Common and Conquer,

07:27.880 --> 07:31.320
 and then I played Warcraft II, which is from Blizzard.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.520
 But at the time, I didn't know,

07:32.520 --> 07:35.520
 I didn't understand about what Blizzard was or anything.

07:35.520 --> 07:36.800
 Warcraft II was just a game,

07:36.800 --> 07:39.760
 which was actually very similar to StarCraft in many ways.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.960
 It's also real time strategy game

07:41.960 --> 07:44.880
 where there's orcs and humans, so there's only two races.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.000
 But it was offline.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.480
 And it was offline, right?

07:47.480 --> 07:51.120
 So I remember a friend of mine came to school,

07:51.120 --> 07:53.480
 say, oh, there's this new cool game called StarCraft.

07:53.480 --> 07:54.920
 And I just said, oh, this sounds like

07:54.920 --> 07:59.240
 just a copy of Warcraft II, until I kind of installed it.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.520
 And at the time, I am from Spain,

08:01.520 --> 08:04.160
 so we didn't have very good internet, right?

08:04.160 --> 08:05.720
 So there was, for us,

08:05.720 --> 08:09.080
 StarCraft became first kind of an offline experience

08:09.080 --> 08:12.480
 where you kind of start to play these missions, right?

08:12.480 --> 08:15.280
 You play against some sort of scripted things

08:15.280 --> 08:18.520
 to develop the story of the characters in the game.

08:18.520 --> 08:23.040
 And then later on, I start playing against the built in AI,

08:23.040 --> 08:25.680
 and I thought it was impossible to defeat it.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.000
 Then eventually you defeat one

08:27.000 --> 08:29.240
 and you can actually play against seven built in AIs

08:29.240 --> 08:32.240
 at the same time, which also felt impossible.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.840
 But actually, it's not that hard to beat

08:34.840 --> 08:36.520
 seven built in AIs at once.

08:36.520 --> 08:40.120
 So once we achieved that, also we discovered that

08:40.120 --> 08:43.400
 we could play, as I said, internet wasn't that great,

08:43.400 --> 08:45.480
 but we could play with the LAN, right?

08:45.480 --> 08:47.600
 Like basically against each other

08:47.600 --> 08:49.480
 if we were in the same place

08:49.480 --> 08:51.880
 because you could just connect machines with like cables,

08:51.880 --> 08:53.200
 right?

08:53.200 --> 08:55.480
 So we started playing in LAN mode

08:55.480 --> 08:58.080
 and as a group of friends,

08:58.080 --> 09:00.520
 and it was really, really like much more entertaining

09:00.520 --> 09:02.280
 than playing against AIs.

09:02.280 --> 09:05.120
 And later on, as internet was starting to develop

09:05.120 --> 09:07.400
 and being a bit faster and more reliable,

09:07.400 --> 09:09.720
 then it's when I started experiencing Battle.net,

09:09.720 --> 09:11.560
 which is this amazing universe,

09:11.560 --> 09:13.720
 not only because of the fact

09:13.720 --> 09:16.440
 that you can play the game against anyone in the world,

09:16.440 --> 09:20.200
 but you can also get to know more people.

09:20.200 --> 09:23.080
 You just get exposed to now like this vast variety of,

09:23.080 --> 09:25.320
 it's kind of a bit when the chats came about, right?

09:25.320 --> 09:27.320
 There was a chat system.

09:27.320 --> 09:29.040
 You could play against people,

09:29.040 --> 09:30.720
 but you could also chat with people,

09:30.720 --> 09:32.480
 not only about Stalker, but about anything.

09:32.480 --> 09:36.640
 And that became a way of life for kind of two years.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.880
 And obviously then it became like kind of,

09:38.880 --> 09:42.240
 it exploded in me in that I started to play more seriously,

09:42.240 --> 09:44.680
 going to tournaments and so on and so forth.

09:44.680 --> 09:49.680
 Do you have a sense on a societal, sociological level,

09:49.840 --> 09:52.240
 what's this whole part of society

09:52.240 --> 09:53.800
 that many of us are not aware of

09:53.800 --> 09:56.840
 and it's a huge part of society, which is gamers.

09:56.840 --> 10:00.920
 I mean, every time I come across that in YouTube

10:00.920 --> 10:03.160
 or streaming sites, I mean,

10:03.160 --> 10:07.600
 this is the huge number of people play games religiously.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.880
 Do you have a sense of those folks,

10:08.880 --> 10:10.840
 especially now that you've returned to that realm

10:10.840 --> 10:12.600
 a little bit on the AI side?

10:12.600 --> 10:15.880
 Yeah, so in fact, even after Stalker,

10:15.880 --> 10:17.600
 I actually played World of Warcraft,

10:17.600 --> 10:21.360
 which is maybe the main sort of online worlds

10:21.360 --> 10:23.880
 or in presence that you get to interact

10:23.880 --> 10:24.720
 with lots of people.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.320
 So I played that for a little bit.

10:26.320 --> 10:29.000
 It was to me, it was a bit less stressful than StarCraft

10:29.000 --> 10:30.840
 because winning was kind of a given.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.320
 You just put in this world

10:32.320 --> 10:34.960
 and you can always complete missions.

10:34.960 --> 10:38.040
 But I think it was actually the social aspect

10:38.040 --> 10:40.400
 of especially StarCraft first

10:40.400 --> 10:43.360
 and then games like World of Warcraft

10:43.360 --> 10:46.880
 really shaped me in a very interesting ways

10:46.880 --> 10:48.480
 because what you get to experience

10:48.480 --> 10:51.600
 is just people you wouldn't usually interact with, right?

10:51.600 --> 10:54.920
 So even nowadays, I still have many Facebook friends

10:54.920 --> 10:56.880
 from the area where I played online

10:56.880 --> 11:00.040
 and their ways of thinking is even political.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.560
 They just, we don't live in,

11:01.560 --> 11:03.640
 like we don't interact in the real world,

11:03.640 --> 11:06.680
 but we were connected by basically fiber.

11:06.680 --> 11:10.760
 And that way I actually get to understand a bit better

11:10.760 --> 11:12.760
 that we live in a diverse world.

11:12.760 --> 11:15.560
 And these were just connections that were made by,

11:15.560 --> 11:18.040
 because, you know, I happened to go in a city

11:18.040 --> 11:22.400
 in a virtual city as a priest and I met this warrior

11:22.400 --> 11:23.600
 and we became friends

11:23.600 --> 11:25.640
 and then we start like playing together, right?

11:25.640 --> 11:28.720
 So I think it's transformative

11:28.720 --> 11:31.240
 and more and more and more people are more aware of it.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.440
 I mean, it's becoming quite mainstream,

11:33.440 --> 11:37.560
 but back in the day, as you were saying in 2000, 2005,

11:37.560 --> 11:42.040
 even it was very, still very strange thing to do,

11:42.040 --> 11:44.200
 especially in Europe.

11:44.200 --> 11:47.080
 I think there were exceptions like Korea, for instance,

11:47.080 --> 11:50.560
 it was amazing that everything happened so early

11:50.560 --> 11:54.400
 in terms of cybercafes, like if you go to Seoul,

11:54.400 --> 11:57.040
 it's a city that back in the day,

11:57.040 --> 11:58.360
 StarCraft was kind of,

11:58.360 --> 12:00.600
 you could be a celebrity by playing StarCraft,

12:00.600 --> 12:03.000
 but this was like 99, 2000, right?

12:03.000 --> 12:04.120
 It's not like recently.

12:04.120 --> 12:08.520
 So yeah, it's quite interesting to look back

12:08.520 --> 12:10.920
 and yeah, I think it's changing society.

12:10.920 --> 12:13.080
 The same way, of course, like technology

12:13.080 --> 12:16.880
 and social networks and so on are also transforming things.

12:16.880 --> 12:18.440
 And a quick tangent, let me ask,

12:18.440 --> 12:20.960
 you're also one of the most productive people

12:20.960 --> 12:25.960
 in your particular chosen passion and path in life.

12:26.400 --> 12:29.440
 And yet you're also appreciate and enjoy video games.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.040
 Do you think it's possible to do,

12:32.680 --> 12:35.760
 to enjoy video games in moderation?

12:35.760 --> 12:39.880
 Someone told me that you could choose two out of three.

12:39.880 --> 12:41.120
 When I was playing video games,

12:41.120 --> 12:43.680
 you could choose having a girlfriend,

12:43.680 --> 12:46.200
 playing video games or studying.

12:46.200 --> 12:50.520
 And I think for the most part, it was relatively true.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.320
 These things do take time.

12:52.320 --> 12:53.320
 Games like StarCraft,

12:53.320 --> 12:55.360
 if you take the game pretty seriously

12:55.360 --> 12:56.480
 and you wanna study it,

12:56.480 --> 12:59.040
 then you obviously will dedicate more time to it.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.160
 And I definitely took gaming

13:01.160 --> 13:03.640
 and obviously studying very seriously.

13:03.640 --> 13:08.640
 I love learning science and et cetera.

13:08.680 --> 13:13.080
 So to me, especially when I started university undergrad,

13:13.080 --> 13:14.880
 I kind of step off StarCraft.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.800
 I actually fully stopped playing.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.000
 And then World of Warcraft was a bit more casual.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.400
 You could just connect online.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.880
 And I mean, it was fun.

13:22.880 --> 13:26.800
 But as I said, that was not as much time investment

13:26.800 --> 13:29.440
 as it was for me in StarCraft.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.600
 Okay, so let's get into AlphaStar.

13:31.600 --> 13:35.160
 What are the, you're behind the team.

13:35.160 --> 13:37.200
 So DeepMind has been working on StarCraft

13:37.200 --> 13:39.360
 and released a bunch of cool open source agents

13:39.360 --> 13:41.280
 and so on the past few years.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.160
 But AlphaStar really is the moment

13:43.160 --> 13:48.160
 where the first time you beat a world class player.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.560
 So what are the parameters of the challenge

13:51.560 --> 13:53.440
 in the way that AlphaStar took it on

13:53.440 --> 13:55.240
 and how did you and David

13:55.240 --> 13:58.240
 and the rest of the DeepMind team get into it?

13:58.240 --> 14:00.920
 Consider that you can even beat the best in the world

14:00.920 --> 14:02.440
 or top players.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.440
 I think it all started back in 2015.

14:08.040 --> 14:08.880
 Actually, I'm lying.

14:08.880 --> 14:13.880
 I think it was 2014 when DeepMind was acquired by Google.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.680
 And I at the time was at Google Brain,

14:15.680 --> 14:18.880
 which was in California, is still in California.

14:18.880 --> 14:21.800
 We had this summit where we got together, the two groups.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.360
 So Google Brain and Google DeepMind got together

14:24.360 --> 14:26.320
 and we gave a series of talks.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.600
 And given that they were doing

14:28.600 --> 14:30.560
 deep reinforcement learning for games,

14:30.560 --> 14:33.600
 I decided to bring up part of my past,

14:33.600 --> 14:35.080
 which I had developed at Berkeley,

14:35.080 --> 14:37.400
 like this thing which we call Berkeley OverMind,

14:37.400 --> 14:40.160
 which is really just a StarCraft one bot, right?

14:40.160 --> 14:42.120
 So I talked about that.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.280
 And I remember Demis just came to me and said,

14:44.280 --> 14:47.120
 well, maybe not now, it's perhaps a bit too early,

14:47.120 --> 14:48.920
 but you should just come to DeepMind

14:48.920 --> 14:53.720
 and do this again with deep reinforcement learning, right?

14:53.720 --> 14:56.600
 And at the time it sounded very science fiction

14:56.600 --> 14:58.760
 for several reasons.

14:58.760 --> 15:01.520
 But then in 2016, when I actually moved to London

15:01.520 --> 15:04.760
 and joined DeepMind transferring from Brain,

15:04.760 --> 15:08.200
 it became apparent that because of the AlphaGo moment

15:08.200 --> 15:11.280
 and kind of Blizzard reaching out to us to say,

15:11.280 --> 15:13.000
 wait, like, do you want the next challenge?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.080
 And also me being full time at DeepMind,

15:15.080 --> 15:17.440
 so sort of kind of all these came together.

15:17.440 --> 15:20.960
 And then I went to Irvine in California,

15:20.960 --> 15:23.800
 to the Blizzard headquarters to just chat with them

15:23.800 --> 15:26.320
 and try to explain how would it all work

15:26.320 --> 15:27.800
 before you do anything.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.680
 And the approach has always been

15:30.680 --> 15:33.640
 about the learning perspective, right?

15:33.640 --> 15:38.640
 So in Berkeley, we did a lot of rule based conditioning

15:39.160 --> 15:42.520
 and if you have more than three units, then go attack.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.200
 And if the other has more units than me,

15:44.200 --> 15:46.360
 I retreat and so on and so forth.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.840
 And of course, the point of deep reinforcement learning,

15:48.840 --> 15:50.480
 deep learning, machine learning in general

15:50.480 --> 15:53.440
 is that all these should be learned behavior.

15:53.440 --> 15:56.960
 So that kind of was the DNA of the project

15:56.960 --> 15:59.480
 since its inception in 2016,

15:59.480 --> 16:02.880
 where we just didn't even have an environment to work with.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.840
 And so that's how it all started really.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.600
 So if you go back to that conversation with Demis

16:08.600 --> 16:12.200
 or even in your own head, how far away did you,

16:12.200 --> 16:14.480
 because we're talking about Atari games,

16:14.480 --> 16:16.680
 we're talking about Go, which is kind of,

16:16.680 --> 16:20.120
 if you're honest about it, really far away from StarCraft.

16:20.120 --> 16:22.160
 In, well, now that you've beaten it,

16:22.160 --> 16:23.280
 maybe you could say it's close,

16:23.280 --> 16:25.880
 but it's much, it seems like StarCraft

16:25.880 --> 16:29.120
 is way harder than Go philosophically

16:29.120 --> 16:30.880
 and mathematically speaking.

16:30.880 --> 16:34.240
 So how far away did you think you were?

16:34.240 --> 16:36.560
 Do you think it's 2019 and 18

16:36.560 --> 16:37.960
 you could be doing as well as you have?

16:37.960 --> 16:40.120
 Yeah, when I kind of thought about,

16:40.120 --> 16:43.000
 okay, I'm gonna dedicate a lot of my time

16:43.000 --> 16:44.080
 and focus on this.

16:44.080 --> 16:47.320
 And obviously I do a lot of different research

16:47.320 --> 16:48.160
 in deep learning.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.000
 So spending time on it, I mean,

16:50.000 --> 16:51.480
 I really had to kind of think

16:51.480 --> 16:55.120
 there's gonna be something good happening out of this.

16:55.120 --> 16:58.400
 So really I thought, well, this sounds impossible.

16:58.400 --> 17:01.000
 And it probably is impossible to do the full thing,

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
 like the full game where you play one versus one

17:06.080 --> 17:09.120
 and it's only a neural network playing and so on.

17:09.120 --> 17:10.360
 So it really felt like,

17:10.360 --> 17:13.360
 I just didn't even think it was possible.

17:13.360 --> 17:14.200
 But on the other hand,

17:14.200 --> 17:18.440
 I could see some stepping stones towards that goal.

17:18.440 --> 17:21.000
 Clearly you could define sub problems in StarCraft

17:21.000 --> 17:22.760
 and sort of dissect it a bit and say,

17:22.760 --> 17:26.080
 okay, here is a part of the game, here's another part.

17:26.080 --> 17:29.240
 And also obviously the fact,

17:29.240 --> 17:31.120
 so this was really also critical to me,

17:31.120 --> 17:34.240
 the fact that we could access human replays, right?

17:34.240 --> 17:35.560
 So Blizzard was very kind.

17:35.560 --> 17:38.400
 And in fact, they open source these for the whole community

17:38.400 --> 17:39.800
 where you can just go

17:39.800 --> 17:42.880
 and it's not every single StarCraft game ever played,

17:42.880 --> 17:45.720
 but it's a lot of them you can just go and download.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.000
 And every day they will,

17:47.000 --> 17:48.800
 you can just query a data set and say,

17:48.800 --> 17:51.520
 well, give me all the games that were played today.

17:51.520 --> 17:55.640
 And given my kind of experience with language

17:55.640 --> 17:57.760
 and sequences and supervised learning,

17:57.760 --> 18:00.600
 I thought, well, that's definitely gonna be very helpful

18:00.600 --> 18:02.240
 and something quite unique now,

18:02.240 --> 18:07.240
 because ever before we had such a large data set of replays,

18:08.040 --> 18:10.840
 of people playing the game at this scale

18:10.840 --> 18:12.400
 of such a complex video game, right?

18:12.400 --> 18:15.480
 So that to me was a precious resource.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.240
 And as soon as I knew that Blizzard

18:17.240 --> 18:20.800
 was able to kind of give this to the community,

18:20.800 --> 18:22.080
 I started to feel positive

18:22.080 --> 18:24.120
 about something non trivial happening.

18:24.120 --> 18:28.240
 But I also thought the full thing, like really no rules,

18:28.240 --> 18:31.120
 no single line of code that tries to say,

18:31.120 --> 18:33.200
 well, I mean, if you see this unit, build a detector,

18:33.200 --> 18:36.560
 all these, not having any of these specializations

18:36.560 --> 18:38.960
 seemed really, really, really difficult to me.

18:38.960 --> 18:39.800
 Intuitively.

18:39.800 --> 18:42.520
 I do also like that Blizzard was teasing

18:42.520 --> 18:43.840
 or even trolling you,

18:45.360 --> 18:48.440
 sort of almost, yeah, pulling you in

18:48.440 --> 18:50.160
 into this really difficult challenge.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.680
 Do they have any awareness?

18:51.680 --> 18:55.600
 What's the interest from the perspective of Blizzard,

18:55.600 --> 18:57.240
 except just curiosity?

18:57.240 --> 18:59.360
 Yeah, I think Blizzard has really understood

18:59.360 --> 19:03.200
 and really bring forward this competitiveness

19:03.200 --> 19:04.720
 of esports in games.

19:04.720 --> 19:07.800
 The StarCraft really kind of sparked a lot of,

19:07.800 --> 19:10.680
 like something that almost was never seen,

19:10.680 --> 19:13.920
 especially as I was saying, back in Korea.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.200
 So they just probably thought,

19:16.200 --> 19:18.840
 well, this is such a pure one versus one setup

19:18.840 --> 19:21.120
 that it would be great to see

19:21.120 --> 19:24.840
 if something that can play Atari or Go

19:24.840 --> 19:27.920
 and then later on chess could even tackle

19:27.920 --> 19:30.600
 these kind of complex real time strategy game, right?

19:30.600 --> 19:33.320
 So for them, they wanted to see first,

19:33.320 --> 19:36.440
 obviously whether it was possible,

19:36.440 --> 19:39.760
 if the game they created was in a way solvable

19:39.760 --> 19:40.840
 to some extent.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.160
 And I think on the other hand,

19:42.160 --> 19:45.760
 they also are a pretty modern company that innovates a lot.

19:45.760 --> 19:48.520
 So just starting to understand AI for them

19:48.520 --> 19:50.240
 to how to bring AI into games

19:50.240 --> 19:54.320
 is not AI for games, but games for AI, right?

19:54.320 --> 19:56.120
 I mean, both ways I think can work.

19:56.120 --> 20:00.040
 And we obviously at DeepMind use games for AI, right?

20:00.040 --> 20:01.240
 To drive AI progress,

20:01.240 --> 20:03.680
 but Blizzard might actually be able to do

20:03.680 --> 20:06.040
 and many other companies to start to understand

20:06.040 --> 20:06.880
 and do the opposite.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.600
 So I think that is also something

20:08.600 --> 20:09.760
 they can get out of these.

20:09.760 --> 20:12.400
 And they definitely, we have brainstormed a lot

20:12.400 --> 20:13.680
 about these, right?

20:13.680 --> 20:15.120
 But one of the interesting things to me

20:15.120 --> 20:17.560
 about StarCraft and Diablo

20:17.560 --> 20:19.360
 and these games that Blizzard has created

20:19.360 --> 20:23.520
 is the task of balancing classes, for example.

20:23.520 --> 20:27.440
 Sort of making the game fair from the starting point

20:27.440 --> 20:29.840
 and then let skill determine the outcome.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.560
 Is there, I mean, can you first comment,

20:33.560 --> 20:36.760
 there's three races, Zerg, Protoss and Terran.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.920
 I don't know if I've ever said that out loud.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.040
 Is that how you pronounce it?

20:40.040 --> 20:40.880
 Terran?

20:40.880 --> 20:41.720
 Yeah, Terran.

20:41.720 --> 20:42.560
 Yeah.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.480
 Yeah, I don't think I've ever in person interacted

20:46.480 --> 20:49.600
 with anybody about StarCraft, that's funny.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.800
 So they seem to be pretty balanced.

20:51.800 --> 20:56.280
 I wonder if the AI, the work that you're doing

20:56.280 --> 20:59.200
 with AlphaStar would help balance them even further.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.560
 Is that something you think about?

21:00.560 --> 21:03.360
 Is that something that Blizzard is thinking about?

21:03.360 --> 21:06.440
 Right, so balancing when you add a new unit

21:06.440 --> 21:09.160
 or a new spell type is obviously possible

21:09.160 --> 21:13.240
 given that you can always train or pre train at scale

21:13.240 --> 21:16.720
 some agent that might start using that in unintended ways.

21:16.720 --> 21:19.200
 But I think actually, if you understand

21:19.200 --> 21:22.240
 how StarCraft has kind of co evolved with players,

21:22.240 --> 21:24.360
 in a way, I think it's actually very cool

21:24.360 --> 21:27.440
 the ways that many of the things and strategies

21:27.440 --> 21:28.720
 that people came up with, right?

21:28.720 --> 21:32.320
 So I think we've seen it over and over in StarCraft

21:32.320 --> 21:35.000
 that Blizzard comes up with maybe a new unit

21:35.000 --> 21:37.280
 and then some players get creative

21:37.280 --> 21:39.120
 and do something kind of unintentional

21:39.120 --> 21:40.920
 or something that Blizzard designers

21:40.920 --> 21:43.600
 that just simply didn't test or think about.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.240
 And then after that becomes kind of mainstream

21:46.240 --> 21:48.280
 in the community, Blizzard patches the game

21:48.280 --> 21:51.920
 and then they kind of maybe weaken that strategy

21:51.920 --> 21:53.920
 or make it actually more interesting

21:53.920 --> 21:55.440
 but a bit more balanced.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.760
 So these kind of continual talk between players

21:57.760 --> 22:01.720
 and Blizzard is kind of what has defined them actually

22:01.720 --> 22:04.040
 in actually most games in StarCraft

22:04.040 --> 22:06.440
 but also in World of Warcraft, they would do that.

22:06.440 --> 22:09.280
 There are several classes and it would be not good

22:09.280 --> 22:13.240
 that everyone plays absolutely the same race and so on, right?

22:13.240 --> 22:17.280
 So I think they do care about balancing of course

22:17.280 --> 22:19.640
 and they do a fair amount of testing

22:19.640 --> 22:22.120
 but it's also beautiful to also see

22:22.120 --> 22:24.480
 how players get creative anyways.

22:24.480 --> 22:27.440
 And I mean, whether AI can be more creative at this point,

22:27.440 --> 22:28.680
 I don't think so, right?

22:28.680 --> 22:31.560
 I mean, it's just sometimes something so amazing happens.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.680
 Like I remember back in the days,

22:33.680 --> 22:36.920
 like you have these drop ships that could drop the rivers

22:36.920 --> 22:39.600
 and that was actually not thought about

22:39.600 --> 22:41.280
 that you could drop this unit

22:41.280 --> 22:43.240
 that has this what's called splash damage

22:43.240 --> 22:45.640
 that would basically eliminate

22:45.640 --> 22:47.840
 all the enemies workers at once.

22:47.840 --> 22:50.120
 No one thought that you could actually put them

22:50.120 --> 22:53.080
 in really early game, do that kind of damage

22:53.080 --> 22:55.440
 and then things change in the game.

22:55.440 --> 22:58.040
 But I don't know, I think it's quite an amazing

22:58.040 --> 23:00.320
 exploration process from both sides,

23:00.320 --> 23:01.880
 players and Blizzard alike.

23:01.880 --> 23:05.040
 Well, it's almost like a reinforcement learning exploration

23:05.040 --> 23:10.040
 but the scale of humans that play Blizzard games

23:11.240 --> 23:13.720
 is almost on the scale of a large scale

23:13.720 --> 23:15.360
 deep mind RL experiment.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.640
 I mean, if you look at the numbers,

23:17.640 --> 23:19.560
 I mean, you're talking about, I don't know how many games

23:19.560 --> 23:22.080
 but hundreds of thousands of games probably a month.

23:22.080 --> 23:22.920
 Yeah.

23:22.920 --> 23:27.920
 I mean, so it's almost the same as running RL agents.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.240
 What aspect of the problem of Starcraft

23:31.240 --> 23:32.160
 do you think is the hardest?

23:32.160 --> 23:35.400
 Is it the, like you said, the imperfect information?

23:35.400 --> 23:38.160
 Is it the fact they have to do longterm planning?

23:38.160 --> 23:40.320
 Is it the real time aspects?

23:40.320 --> 23:42.240
 We have to do stuff really quickly.

23:42.240 --> 23:44.760
 Is it the fact that a large action space

23:44.760 --> 23:47.640
 so you can do so many possible things?

23:47.640 --> 23:51.120
 Or is it, you know, in the game theoretic sense

23:51.120 --> 23:52.400
 there is no Nash equilibrium

23:52.400 --> 23:54.280
 or at least you don't know what the optimal strategy is

23:54.280 --> 23:56.520
 because there's way too many options.

23:56.520 --> 23:57.360
 Right.

23:57.360 --> 23:59.520
 Is there something that stands out as just like the hardest

23:59.520 --> 24:01.000
 the most annoying thing?

24:01.000 --> 24:04.200
 So when we sort of looked at the problem

24:04.200 --> 24:07.640
 and start to define like the parameters of it, right?

24:07.640 --> 24:08.800
 What are the observations?

24:08.800 --> 24:10.520
 What are the actions?

24:10.520 --> 24:13.880
 It became very apparent that, you know,

24:13.880 --> 24:17.160
 the very first barrier that one would hit in Starcraft

24:17.160 --> 24:20.720
 would be because of the action space being so large

24:20.720 --> 24:24.880
 and as not being able to search like you could in chess

24:24.880 --> 24:27.320
 or go even though the search space is vast.

24:28.640 --> 24:30.600
 The main problem that we identified

24:30.600 --> 24:32.440
 was that of exploration, right?

24:32.440 --> 24:36.720
 So without any sort of human knowledge or human prior,

24:36.720 --> 24:38.040
 if you think about Starcraft

24:38.040 --> 24:40.880
 and you know how deep reinforcement learnings algorithm

24:40.880 --> 24:45.400
 work which is essentially by issuing random actions

24:45.400 --> 24:47.840
 and hoping that they will get some wins sometimes

24:47.840 --> 24:49.240
 so they could learn.

24:49.240 --> 24:52.840
 So if you think of the action space in Starcraft

24:52.840 --> 24:55.920
 almost anything you can do in the early game is bad

24:55.920 --> 24:58.760
 because any action involves taking workers

24:58.760 --> 25:01.360
 which are mining minerals for free.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.560
 That's something that the game does automatically

25:03.560 --> 25:04.920
 sends them to mine.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.760
 And you would immediately just take them out of mining

25:07.760 --> 25:09.080
 and send them around.

25:09.080 --> 25:13.640
 So just thinking how is it gonna be possible

25:13.640 --> 25:16.920
 to get to understand these concepts

25:16.920 --> 25:19.280
 but even more like expanding, right?

25:19.280 --> 25:21.080
 There's these buildings you can place

25:21.080 --> 25:24.160
 in other locations in the map to gather more resources

25:24.160 --> 25:26.840
 but the location of the building is important

25:26.840 --> 25:28.880
 and you have to select a worker,

25:28.880 --> 25:32.680
 send it walking to that location, build the building,

25:32.680 --> 25:34.120
 wait for the building to be built

25:34.120 --> 25:37.800
 and then put extra workers there so they start mining.

25:37.800 --> 25:41.720
 That feels like impossible if you just randomly click

25:41.720 --> 25:44.480
 to produce that state, desirable state

25:44.480 --> 25:46.960
 that then you could hope to learn from

25:46.960 --> 25:49.800
 because eventually that may yield to an extra win, right?

25:49.800 --> 25:51.760
 So for me, the exploration problem

25:51.760 --> 25:53.760
 and due to the action space

25:53.760 --> 25:56.080
 and the fact that there's not really turns,

25:56.080 --> 25:59.120
 there's so many turns because the game essentially

25:59.120 --> 26:02.040
 takes that 22 times per second.

26:02.040 --> 26:05.520
 I mean, that's how they could discretize sort of time.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.280
 Obviously you always have to discretize time

26:07.280 --> 26:09.600
 but there's no such thing as real time

26:09.600 --> 26:12.520
 but it's really a lot of time steps

26:12.520 --> 26:14.240
 of things that could go wrong.

26:14.240 --> 26:17.920
 And that definitely felt a priori like the hardest.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.320
 You mentioned many good ones.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.120
 I think partial observability

26:21.120 --> 26:23.440
 and the fact that there is no perfect strategy

26:23.440 --> 26:25.520
 because of the partial observability.

26:25.520 --> 26:26.840
 Those are very interesting problems.

26:26.840 --> 26:28.520
 We start seeing more and more now

26:28.520 --> 26:31.040
 in terms of as we solve the previous ones

26:31.040 --> 26:34.240
 but the core problem to me was exploration

26:34.240 --> 26:37.720
 and solving it has been basically kind of the focus

26:37.720 --> 26:39.760
 and how we saw the first breakthroughs.

26:39.760 --> 26:43.680
 So exploration in a multi hierarchical way.

26:43.680 --> 26:46.560
 So like 22 times a second exploration

26:46.560 --> 26:48.600
 has a very different meaning than it does

26:48.600 --> 26:51.440
 in terms of should I gather resources early

26:51.440 --> 26:53.200
 or should I wait or so on.

26:53.200 --> 26:56.200
 So how do you solve the longterm?

26:56.200 --> 26:58.080
 Let's talk about the internals of AlphaStar.

26:58.080 --> 27:02.480
 So first of all, how do you represent the state

27:02.480 --> 27:05.440
 of the game as an input?

27:05.440 --> 27:08.800
 How do you then do the longterm sequence modeling?

27:08.800 --> 27:10.760
 How do you build a policy?

27:10.760 --> 27:12.560
 What's the architecture like?

27:12.560 --> 27:16.840
 So AlphaStar has obviously several components

27:16.840 --> 27:20.880
 but everything passes through what we call the policy

27:20.880 --> 27:22.280
 which is a neural network.

27:22.280 --> 27:24.280
 And that's kind of the beauty of it.

27:24.280 --> 27:27.160
 There is, I could just now give you a neural network

27:27.160 --> 27:28.520
 and some weights.

27:28.520 --> 27:30.440
 And if you fed the right observations

27:30.440 --> 27:32.560
 and you understood the actions the same way we do

27:32.560 --> 27:35.120
 you would have basically the agent playing the game.

27:35.120 --> 27:37.240
 There's absolutely nothing else needed

27:37.240 --> 27:40.320
 other than those weights that were trained.

27:40.320 --> 27:43.360
 Now, the first step is observing the game

27:43.360 --> 27:46.640
 and we've experimented with a few alternatives.

27:46.640 --> 27:50.280
 The one that we currently use mixes both spatial

27:50.280 --> 27:53.800
 sort of images that you would process from the game

27:53.800 --> 27:56.400
 that is the zoomed out version of the map

27:56.400 --> 27:58.960
 and also a zoomed in version of the camera

27:58.960 --> 28:00.880
 or the screen as we call it.

28:00.880 --> 28:04.840
 But also we give to the agent the list of units

28:04.840 --> 28:09.000
 that it sees more of as a set of objects

28:09.000 --> 28:11.040
 that it can operate on.

28:11.040 --> 28:14.760
 That is not necessarily required to use it.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.840
 And we have versions of the game that play well

28:16.840 --> 28:19.760
 without this set vision that is a bit not like

28:19.760 --> 28:21.640
 how humans perceive the game.

28:21.640 --> 28:23.600
 But it certainly helps a lot

28:23.600 --> 28:26.520
 because it's a very natural way to encode the game

28:26.520 --> 28:29.360
 is by just looking at all the units that there are.

28:29.360 --> 28:33.920
 They have properties like health, position, type of unit

28:33.920 --> 28:36.160
 whether it's my unit or the enemies.

28:36.160 --> 28:40.760
 And that sort of is kind of the summary

28:40.760 --> 28:43.040
 of the state of the game,

28:43.040 --> 28:45.480
 that list of units or set of units

28:45.480 --> 28:47.360
 that you see all the time.

28:47.360 --> 28:49.560
 But that's pretty close to the way humans see the game.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.520
 Why do you say it's not, isn't that,

28:51.520 --> 28:55.040
 you're saying the exactness of it is not similar to humans?

28:55.040 --> 28:57.200
 The exactness of it is perhaps not the problem.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.800
 I guess maybe the problem if you look at it

28:59.800 --> 29:02.320
 from how actually humans play the game

29:02.320 --> 29:05.720
 is that they play with a mouse and a keyboard and a screen

29:05.720 --> 29:08.720
 and they don't see sort of a structured object

29:08.720 --> 29:09.560
 with all the units.

29:09.560 --> 29:12.200
 What they see is what they see on the screen, right?

29:12.200 --> 29:13.040
 So.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.360
 Remember that there's a, sorry to interrupt,

29:14.360 --> 29:16.960
 there's a plot that you showed with camera base

29:16.960 --> 29:18.600
 where you do exactly that, right?

29:18.600 --> 29:21.080
 You move around and that seems to converge

29:21.080 --> 29:22.240
 to similar performance.

29:22.240 --> 29:23.520
 Yeah, I think that's what I,

29:23.520 --> 29:26.320
 we're kind of experimenting with what's necessary or not,

29:26.320 --> 29:28.720
 but using the set.

29:28.720 --> 29:32.360
 So, actually, if you look at research in computer vision,

29:32.360 --> 29:35.960
 where it makes a lot of sense to treat images

29:35.960 --> 29:38.160
 as two dimensional arrays,

29:38.160 --> 29:40.360
 there's actually a very nice paper from Facebook.

29:40.360 --> 29:42.720
 I think, I forgot who the authors are,

29:42.720 --> 29:46.360
 but I think it's part of Caming's group.

29:46.360 --> 29:49.520
 And what they do is they take an image,

29:49.520 --> 29:51.920
 which is this two dimensional signal,

29:51.920 --> 29:54.280
 and they actually take pixel by pixel

29:54.280 --> 29:59.120
 and scramble the image as if it was just a list of pixels.

29:59.120 --> 30:01.760
 Crucially, they encode the position of the pixels

30:01.760 --> 30:03.680
 with the X, Y coordinates.

30:03.680 --> 30:06.120
 And this is just kind of a new architecture,

30:06.120 --> 30:08.480
 which we incidentally also use in StarCraft

30:08.480 --> 30:09.800
 called the Transformer,

30:09.800 --> 30:11.960
 which is a very popular paper from last year,

30:11.960 --> 30:15.560
 which yielded very nice result in machine translation.

30:15.560 --> 30:18.000
 And if you actually believe in this kind of,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.280
 oh, it's actually a set of pixels,

30:20.280 --> 30:22.520
 as long as you encode X, Y, it's okay,

30:22.520 --> 30:26.080
 then you could argue that the list of units that we see

30:26.080 --> 30:26.920
 is precisely that,

30:26.920 --> 30:31.440
 because we have each unit as a kind of pixel, if you will,

30:31.440 --> 30:33.200
 and then their X, Y coordinates.

30:33.200 --> 30:36.360
 So in that perspective, we, without knowing it,

30:36.360 --> 30:38.680
 we use the same architecture that was shown

30:38.680 --> 30:41.360
 to work very well on Pascal and ImageNet and so on.

30:41.360 --> 30:45.400
 So the interesting thing here is putting it in that way

30:45.400 --> 30:46.880
 it starts to move it towards

30:46.880 --> 30:49.400
 the way you usually work with language.

30:49.400 --> 30:52.680
 So what, and especially with your expertise

30:52.680 --> 30:55.440
 and work in language,

30:55.440 --> 30:57.880
 it seems like there's echoes of a lot of

30:58.920 --> 31:00.640
 the way you would work with natural language

31:00.640 --> 31:02.320
 in the way you've approached AlphaStar.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.160
 Right.

31:03.160 --> 31:05.000
 What's, does that help

31:05.000 --> 31:08.120
 with the longterm sequence modeling there somehow?

31:08.120 --> 31:10.160
 Exactly, so now that we understand

31:10.160 --> 31:13.520
 what an observation for a given time step is,

31:13.520 --> 31:14.600
 we need to move on to say,

31:14.600 --> 31:17.680
 well, there's going to be a sequence of such observations

31:17.680 --> 31:21.040
 and an agent will need to, given all that it's seen,

31:21.040 --> 31:24.040
 not only the current time step, but all that it's seen, why?

31:24.040 --> 31:25.880
 Because there is partial observability.

31:25.880 --> 31:29.000
 We must remember whether we saw a worker going somewhere,

31:29.000 --> 31:30.040
 for instance, right?

31:30.040 --> 31:31.680
 Because then there might be an expansion

31:31.680 --> 31:33.560
 on the top right of the map.

31:33.560 --> 31:37.920
 So given that, what you must then think about is

31:37.920 --> 31:40.320
 there is the problem of given all the observations,

31:40.320 --> 31:42.560
 you have to predict the next action.

31:42.560 --> 31:44.440
 And not only given all the observations,

31:44.440 --> 31:45.880
 but given all the observations

31:45.880 --> 31:47.840
 and given all the actions you've taken,

31:47.840 --> 31:49.280
 predict the next action.

31:49.280 --> 31:53.520
 And that sounds exactly like machine translation where,

31:53.520 --> 31:57.080
 and that's exactly how kind of I saw the problem,

31:57.080 --> 31:59.920
 especially when you are given supervised data

31:59.920 --> 32:01.680
 or replays from humans,

32:01.680 --> 32:03.520
 because the problem is exactly the same.

32:03.520 --> 32:07.600
 You're translating essentially a prefix of observations

32:07.600 --> 32:10.080
 and actions onto what's going to happen next,

32:10.080 --> 32:12.920
 which is exactly how you would train a model to translate

32:12.920 --> 32:14.680
 or to generate language as well, right?

32:14.680 --> 32:16.560
 Do you have a certain prefix?

32:16.560 --> 32:18.920
 You must remember everything that comes in the past

32:18.920 --> 32:22.560
 because otherwise you might start having noncoherent text.

32:22.560 --> 32:26.480
 And the same architectures we're using LSTMs

32:26.480 --> 32:29.680
 and transformers to operate on across time

32:29.680 --> 32:33.000
 to kind of integrate all that's happened in the past.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.640
 Those architectures that work so well in translation

32:35.640 --> 32:38.320
 or language modeling are exactly the same

32:38.320 --> 32:42.280
 than what the agent is using to issue actions in the game.

32:42.280 --> 32:44.680
 And the way we train it, moreover, for imitation,

32:44.680 --> 32:47.040
 which is step one of AlphaStar is,

32:47.040 --> 32:49.800
 take all the human experience and try to imitate it,

32:49.800 --> 32:52.840
 much like you try to imitate translators

32:52.840 --> 32:55.280
 that translated many pairs of sentences

32:55.280 --> 32:57.200
 from French to English say,

32:57.200 --> 33:00.120
 that sort of principle applies exactly the same.

33:00.120 --> 33:04.440
 It's almost the same code, except that instead of words,

33:04.440 --> 33:06.600
 you have a slightly more complicated objects,

33:06.600 --> 33:08.840
 which are the observations and the actions

33:08.840 --> 33:11.720
 are also a bit more complicated than a word.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.920
 Is there a self play component then too?

33:13.920 --> 33:16.480
 So once you run out of imitation?

33:16.480 --> 33:21.480
 Right, so indeed you can bootstrap from human replays,

33:22.240 --> 33:25.960
 but then the agents you get are actually not as good

33:25.960 --> 33:28.160
 as the humans you imitated, right?

33:28.160 --> 33:30.440
 So how do we imitate?

33:30.440 --> 33:34.280
 Well, we take humans from 3000 MMR and higher.

33:34.280 --> 33:37.960
 3000 MMR is just a metric of human skill

33:37.960 --> 33:41.880
 and 3000 MMR might be like 50% percentile, right?

33:41.880 --> 33:43.760
 So it's just average human.

33:43.760 --> 33:44.600
 What's that?

33:44.600 --> 33:47.760
 So maybe quick pause, MMR is a ranking scale,

33:47.760 --> 33:50.320
 the matchmaking rating for players.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.320
 So it's 3000, I remember there's like a master

33:52.320 --> 33:54.120
 and a grand master, what's 3000?

33:54.120 --> 33:56.720
 So 3000 is pretty bad.

33:56.720 --> 33:58.440
 I think it's kind of goals level.

33:58.440 --> 34:00.680
 It just sounds really good relative to chess, I think.

34:00.680 --> 34:02.440
 Oh yeah, yeah, no, the ratings,

34:02.440 --> 34:05.320
 the best in the world are at 7,000 MMR.

34:05.320 --> 34:07.840
 So 3000, it's a bit like Elo indeed, right?

34:07.840 --> 34:12.840
 So 3,500 just allows us to not filter a lot of the data.

34:13.200 --> 34:15.680
 So we like to have a lot of data in deep learning

34:15.680 --> 34:17.320
 as you probably know.

34:17.320 --> 34:20.640
 So we take these kind of 3,500 and above,

34:20.640 --> 34:22.680
 but then we do a very interesting trick,

34:22.680 --> 34:25.000
 which is we tell the neural network

34:25.000 --> 34:27.560
 what level they are imitating.

34:27.560 --> 34:30.800
 So we say, this replay you're gonna try to imitate

34:30.800 --> 34:33.040
 to predict the next action for all the actions

34:33.040 --> 34:36.120
 that you're gonna see is a 4,000 MMR replay.

34:36.120 --> 34:38.840
 This one is a 6,000 MMR replay.

34:38.840 --> 34:42.520
 And what's cool about this is then we take this policy

34:42.520 --> 34:44.320
 that is being trained from human,

34:44.320 --> 34:47.440
 and then we can ask it to play like a 3000 MMR player

34:47.440 --> 34:49.600
 by setting a beat saying, well, okay,

34:49.600 --> 34:51.280
 play like a 3000 MMR player

34:51.280 --> 34:53.720
 or play like a 6,000 MMR player.

34:53.720 --> 34:57.320
 And you actually see how the policy behaves differently.

34:57.320 --> 35:01.520
 It gets worse economy if you play like a goal level player,

35:01.520 --> 35:03.000
 it does less actions per minute,

35:03.000 --> 35:05.360
 which is the number of clicks or number of actions

35:05.360 --> 35:07.800
 that you will issue in a whole minute.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.240
 And it's very interesting to see

35:09.240 --> 35:12.360
 that it kind of imitates the skill level quite well.

35:12.360 --> 35:15.480
 But if we ask it to play like a 6,000 MMR player,

35:15.480 --> 35:18.640
 we tested, of course, these policies to see how well they do.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.600
 They actually beat all the built in AIs

35:20.600 --> 35:22.440
 that Blizzard put in the game,

35:22.440 --> 35:25.000
 but they're nowhere near 6,000 MMR players, right?

35:25.000 --> 35:29.280
 They might be maybe around goal level, platinum, perhaps.

35:29.280 --> 35:32.240
 So there's still a lot of work to be done for the policy

35:32.240 --> 35:35.000
 to truly understand what it means to win.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.240
 So far, we only asked them, okay, here is the screen.

35:38.240 --> 35:41.680
 And that's what's happened on the game until this point.

35:41.680 --> 35:46.160
 What would the next action be if we ask a pro to now say,

35:46.160 --> 35:49.160
 oh, you're gonna click here or here or there.

35:49.160 --> 35:53.720
 And the point is experiencing wins and losses

35:53.720 --> 35:56.400
 is very important to then start to refine.

35:56.400 --> 35:58.400
 Otherwise the policy can get loose,

35:58.400 --> 36:00.520
 can just go off policy as we call it.

36:00.520 --> 36:03.480
 That's so interesting that you can at least hope eventually

36:03.480 --> 36:06.840
 to be able to control a policy

36:06.840 --> 36:10.000
 approximately to be at some MMR level.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.720
 That's so interesting, especially given that you have

36:12.720 --> 36:15.080
 ground truth for a lot of these cases.

36:15.080 --> 36:17.560
 Can I ask you a personal question?

36:17.560 --> 36:19.240
 What's your MMR?

36:19.240 --> 36:23.680
 Well, I haven't played StarCraft II, so I am unranked,

36:23.680 --> 36:26.200
 which is the kind of lowest league.

36:26.200 --> 36:29.600
 So I used to play StarCraft, the first one.

36:29.600 --> 36:32.680
 But you haven't seriously played StarCraft II.

36:32.680 --> 36:37.680
 So the best player we have at DeepMind is about 5,000 MMR,

36:37.760 --> 36:39.640
 which is high masters.

36:39.640 --> 36:42.120
 It's not at grand master level.

36:42.120 --> 36:44.680
 Grand master level will be the top 200 players

36:44.680 --> 36:47.960
 in a certain region like Europe or America or Asia.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.640
 But for me, it would be hard to say.

36:51.640 --> 36:53.760
 I am very bad at the game.

36:53.760 --> 36:56.680
 I actually played AlphaStar a bit too late and it beat me.

36:56.680 --> 36:59.760
 I remember the whole team was, oh, Oreo, you should play.

36:59.760 --> 37:02.240
 And I was, oh, it looks like it's not so good yet.

37:02.240 --> 37:04.960
 And then I remember I kind of got busy

37:04.960 --> 37:07.320
 and waited an extra week and I played

37:07.320 --> 37:09.760
 and it really beat me very badly.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.560
 Was that, I mean, how did that feel?

37:11.560 --> 37:12.720
 Isn't that an amazing feeling?

37:12.720 --> 37:13.640
 That's amazing, yeah.

37:13.640 --> 37:16.560
 I mean, obviously I tried my best

37:16.560 --> 37:18.120
 and I tried to also impress my,

37:18.120 --> 37:19.840
 because I actually played the first game.

37:19.840 --> 37:23.160
 So I'm still pretty good at micromanagement.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.320
 The problem is I just don't understand StarCraft II.

37:25.320 --> 37:27.000
 I understand StarCraft.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.560
 And when I played StarCraft,

37:28.560 --> 37:32.760
 I probably was consistently like for a couple of years,

37:32.760 --> 37:34.720
 top 32 in Europe.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.280
 So I was decent, but at the time we didn't have

37:37.280 --> 37:40.400
 this kind of MMR system as well established.

37:40.400 --> 37:43.240
 So it would be hard to know what it was back then.

37:43.240 --> 37:44.720
 So what's the difference in interface

37:44.720 --> 37:47.800
 between AlphaStar and StarCraft

37:47.800 --> 37:49.720
 and a human player in StarCraft?

37:49.720 --> 37:52.120
 Is there any significant differences

37:52.120 --> 37:54.200
 between the way they both see the game?

37:54.200 --> 37:56.080
 I would say the way they see the game,

37:56.080 --> 37:59.760
 there's a few things that are just very hard to simulate.

38:01.080 --> 38:05.240
 The main one perhaps, which is obvious in hindsight

38:05.240 --> 38:10.240
 is what's called cloaked units, which are invisible units.

38:10.600 --> 38:13.280
 So in StarCraft, you can make some units

38:13.280 --> 38:16.800
 that you need to have a particular kind of unit

38:16.800 --> 38:18.080
 to detect it.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.600
 So these units are invisible.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.760
 If you cannot detect them, you cannot target them.

38:22.760 --> 38:25.800
 So they would just destroy your buildings

38:25.800 --> 38:27.760
 or kill your workers.

38:27.760 --> 38:31.680
 But despite the fact you cannot target the unit,

38:31.680 --> 38:34.640
 there's a shimmer that as a human you observe.

38:34.640 --> 38:35.960
 I mean, you need to train a little bit,

38:35.960 --> 38:37.480
 you need to pay attention,

38:37.480 --> 38:41.920
 but you would see this kind of space time distortion

38:41.920 --> 38:44.880
 and you would know, okay, there are, yeah.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.080
 Yeah, there's like a wave thing.

38:46.080 --> 38:47.720
 Yeah, it's called shimmer.

38:47.720 --> 38:49.200
 Space time distortion, I like it.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.960
 That's really like, the Blizzard term is shimmer.

38:51.960 --> 38:52.800
 Shimmer, okay.

38:52.800 --> 38:55.600
 And so these shimmer professional players

38:55.600 --> 38:57.160
 actually can see it immediately.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.520
 They understand it very well,

38:59.520 --> 39:01.440
 but it's still something that requires

39:01.440 --> 39:02.720
 certain amount of attention

39:02.720 --> 39:05.680
 and it's kind of a bit annoying to deal with.

39:05.680 --> 39:08.640
 Whereas for AlphaStar, in terms of vision,

39:08.640 --> 39:11.120
 it's very hard for us to simulate sort of,

39:11.120 --> 39:14.200
 oh, are you looking at this pixel in the screen and so on?

39:14.200 --> 39:17.520
 So the only thing we can do is,

39:17.520 --> 39:19.720
 there is a unit that's invisible over there.

39:19.720 --> 39:22.520
 So AlphaStar would know that immediately.

39:22.520 --> 39:24.040
 Obviously still obeys the rules.

39:24.040 --> 39:25.200
 You cannot attack the unit.

39:25.200 --> 39:27.440
 You must have a detector and so on,

39:27.440 --> 39:29.360
 but it's kind of one of the main things

39:29.360 --> 39:32.720
 that it just doesn't feel there's a very proper way.

39:32.720 --> 39:35.520
 I mean, you could imagine, oh, you don't have hypers.

39:35.520 --> 39:37.000
 Maybe you don't know exactly where it is,

39:37.000 --> 39:39.280
 or sometimes you see it, sometimes you don't,

39:39.280 --> 39:43.040
 but it's just really, really complicated to get it

39:43.040 --> 39:44.320
 so that everyone would agree,

39:44.320 --> 39:47.680
 oh, that's the best way to simulate this, right?

39:47.680 --> 39:49.320
 It seems like a perception problem.

39:49.320 --> 39:50.640
 It is a perception problem.

39:50.640 --> 39:54.280
 So the only problem is people, you ask,

39:54.280 --> 39:55.320
 oh, what's the difference between

39:55.320 --> 39:56.760
 how humans perceive the game?

39:56.760 --> 39:59.960
 I would say they wouldn't be able to tell a shimmer

39:59.960 --> 40:02.240
 immediately as it appears on the screen,

40:02.240 --> 40:05.640
 whereas AlphaStar in principle sees it very sharply, right?

40:05.640 --> 40:08.680
 It sees that the bit turned from zero to one,

40:08.680 --> 40:10.480
 meaning there's now a unit there,

40:10.480 --> 40:11.960
 although you don't know the unit,

40:11.960 --> 40:15.840
 or you know that you cannot attack it and so on.

40:15.840 --> 40:18.080
 So that from a vision standpoint,

40:18.080 --> 40:22.960
 that probably is the one that is kind of the most obvious one.

40:22.960 --> 40:25.160
 Then there are things humans cannot do perfectly,

40:25.160 --> 40:28.080
 even professionals, which is they might miss a detail,

40:28.080 --> 40:30.600
 or they might have not seen a unit.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.240
 And obviously as a computer,

40:32.240 --> 40:35.000
 if there's a corner of the screen that turns green

40:35.000 --> 40:37.680
 because a unit enters the field of view,

40:37.680 --> 40:41.040
 that can go into the memory of the agent, the LSTM,

40:41.040 --> 40:42.480
 and persist there for a while,

40:42.480 --> 40:45.680
 and for however long is relevant, right?

40:45.680 --> 40:47.680
 And in terms of action,

40:47.680 --> 40:50.720
 it seems like the rate of action from AlphaStar

40:50.720 --> 40:54.280
 is comparative, if not slower than professional players,

40:54.280 --> 40:57.120
 but it's more precise is what I read.

40:57.120 --> 41:01.840
 So that's really probably the one that is causing us

41:01.840 --> 41:05.000
 more issues for a couple of reasons, right?

41:05.000 --> 41:08.400
 The first one is StarCraft has been an AI environment

41:08.400 --> 41:09.960
 for quite a few years.

41:09.960 --> 41:12.760
 In fact, I mean, I was participating

41:12.760 --> 41:15.880
 in the very first competition back in 2010.

41:15.880 --> 41:19.880
 And there's really not been a kind of a very clear set

41:19.880 --> 41:22.320
 of rules how the actions per minute,

41:22.320 --> 41:24.720
 the rate of actions that you can issue is.

41:24.720 --> 41:29.280
 And as a result, these agents or bots that people build

41:29.280 --> 41:31.080
 in a kind of almost very cool way,

41:31.080 --> 41:35.400
 they do like 20,000, 40,000 actions per minute.

41:35.400 --> 41:37.200
 Now, to put this in perspective,

41:37.200 --> 41:39.520
 a very good professional human

41:39.520 --> 41:44.080
 might do 300 to 800 actions per minute.

41:44.080 --> 41:45.480
 They might not be as precise.

41:45.480 --> 41:49.040
 That's why the range is a bit tricky to identify exactly.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.560
 I mean, 300 actions per minute precisely

41:51.560 --> 41:53.400
 is probably realistic.

41:53.400 --> 41:56.960
 800 is probably not, but you see humans doing a lot of actions

41:56.960 --> 41:59.480
 because they warm up and they kind of select things

41:59.480 --> 42:02.240
 and spam and so on just so that when they need,

42:02.240 --> 42:04.320
 they have the accuracy.

42:04.320 --> 42:09.680
 So we came into this by not having kind of a standard way

42:09.680 --> 42:13.240
 to say, well, how do we measure whether an agent is

42:13.240 --> 42:15.760
 at human level or not?

42:15.760 --> 42:18.320
 On the other hand, we had a huge advantage,

42:18.320 --> 42:21.360
 which is because we do imitation learning,

42:21.360 --> 42:24.480
 agents turned out to act like humans

42:24.480 --> 42:26.240
 in terms of rate of actions, even

42:26.240 --> 42:28.720
 precisions and imprecisions of actions

42:28.720 --> 42:30.160
 in the supervised policy.

42:30.160 --> 42:31.160
 You could see all these.

42:31.160 --> 42:34.600
 You could see how agents like to spam click, to move here.

42:34.600 --> 42:37.280
 If you played especially Diablo, you wouldn't know what I mean.

42:37.280 --> 42:39.720
 I mean, you just like spam, oh, move here, move here,

42:39.720 --> 42:40.320
 move here.

42:40.320 --> 42:43.280
 You're doing literally like maybe five actions

42:43.280 --> 42:45.640
 in two seconds, but these actions are not

42:45.640 --> 42:46.840
 very meaningful.

42:46.840 --> 42:48.720
 One would have sufficed.

42:48.720 --> 42:52.080
 So on the one hand, we start from this imitation policy

42:52.080 --> 42:55.600
 that is at the ballpark of the actions per minutes of humans

42:55.600 --> 42:57.280
 because it's actually statistically

42:57.280 --> 42:58.920
 trying to imitate humans.

42:58.920 --> 43:01.040
 So we see these very nicely in the curves

43:01.040 --> 43:02.480
 that we showed in the blog post.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.480
 There's these actions per minute,

43:04.480 --> 43:07.640
 and the distribution looks very human like.

43:07.640 --> 43:10.920
 But then, of course, as self play kicks in,

43:10.920 --> 43:13.240
 and that's the part we haven't talked too much yet,

43:13.240 --> 43:17.160
 but of course, the agent must play against itself to improve,

43:17.160 --> 43:19.600
 then there's almost no guarantees

43:19.600 --> 43:22.400
 that these actions will not become more precise

43:22.400 --> 43:26.120
 or even the rate of actions is going to increase over time.

43:26.120 --> 43:29.080
 So what we did, and this is probably

43:29.080 --> 43:31.200
 the first attempt that we thought was reasonable,

43:31.200 --> 43:33.120
 is we looked at the distribution of actions

43:33.120 --> 43:36.360
 for humans for certain windows of time.

43:36.360 --> 43:39.280
 And just to give a perspective, because I guess I mentioned

43:39.280 --> 43:41.640
 that some of these agents that are programmatic,

43:41.640 --> 43:42.320
 let's call them.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.560
 They do 40,000 actions per minute.

43:44.560 --> 43:47.320
 Professionals, as I said, do 300 to 800.

43:47.320 --> 43:49.400
 So what we looked is we look at the distribution

43:49.400 --> 43:53.680
 over professional gamers, and we took reasonably high actions

43:53.680 --> 43:57.400
 per minute, but we kind of identify certain cutoffs

43:57.400 --> 44:00.520
 after which, even if the agent wanted to act,

44:00.520 --> 44:02.920
 these actions would be dropped.

44:02.920 --> 44:07.040
 But the problem is this cutoff is probably set a bit too high.

44:07.040 --> 44:10.040
 And what ends up happening, even though the games,

44:10.040 --> 44:12.040
 and when we ask the professionals and the gamers,

44:12.040 --> 44:15.840
 by and large, they feel like it's playing humanlike,

44:15.840 --> 44:20.640
 there are some agents that developed maybe slightly

44:20.640 --> 44:24.200
 too high APMs, which is actions per minute,

44:24.200 --> 44:27.000
 combined with the precision, which

44:27.000 --> 44:30.520
 made people start discussing a very interesting issue, which

44:30.520 --> 44:32.440
 is, should we have limited these?

44:32.440 --> 44:35.880
 Should we just let it lose and see what cool things

44:35.880 --> 44:37.040
 it can come up with?

44:37.040 --> 44:37.520
 Right?

44:37.520 --> 44:38.200
 Interesting.

44:38.200 --> 44:41.520
 So this is in itself an extremely interesting

44:41.520 --> 44:44.000
 question, but the same way that modeling the shimmer

44:44.000 --> 44:47.720
 would be so difficult, modeling absolutely all the details

44:47.720 --> 44:51.680
 about muscles and precision and tiredness of humans

44:51.680 --> 44:52.960
 would be quite difficult.

44:52.960 --> 44:56.280
 So we're really here kind of innovating

44:56.280 --> 44:58.960
 in this sense of, OK, what could be maybe

44:58.960 --> 45:02.040
 the next iteration of putting more rules that

45:02.040 --> 45:06.360
 makes the agents more humanlike in terms of restrictions?

45:06.360 --> 45:08.120
 Yeah, putting constraints that.

45:08.120 --> 45:09.240
 More constraints, yeah.

45:09.240 --> 45:10.200
 That's really interesting.

45:10.200 --> 45:11.200
 That's really innovative.

45:11.200 --> 45:15.360
 So one of the constraints you put on yourself,

45:15.360 --> 45:18.040
 or at least focused in, is on the Protoss race,

45:18.040 --> 45:19.920
 as far as I understand.

45:19.920 --> 45:21.920
 Can you tell me about the different races

45:21.920 --> 45:26.000
 and how they, so Protoss, Terran, and Zerg,

45:26.000 --> 45:27.080
 how do they compare?

45:27.080 --> 45:28.160
 How do they interact?

45:28.160 --> 45:30.360
 Why did you choose Protoss?

45:30.360 --> 45:34.000
 Yeah, in the dynamics of the game seen

45:34.000 --> 45:35.680
 from a strategic perspective.

45:35.680 --> 45:39.680
 So Protoss, so in StarCraft there are three races.

45:39.680 --> 45:43.880
 Indeed, in the demonstration, we saw only the Protoss race.

45:43.880 --> 45:45.560
 So maybe let's start with that one.

45:45.560 --> 45:49.440
 Protoss is kind of the most technologically advanced race.

45:49.440 --> 45:53.800
 It has units that are expensive but powerful.

45:53.800 --> 45:57.880
 So in general, you want to kind of conserve your units

45:57.880 --> 45:59.520
 as you go attack.

45:59.520 --> 46:03.280
 And then you want to utilize these tactical advantages

46:03.280 --> 46:07.320
 of very fancy spells and so on and so forth.

46:07.320 --> 46:11.480
 And at the same time, they're kind of,

46:11.480 --> 46:15.280
 people say they're a bit easier to play perhaps.

46:15.280 --> 46:17.160
 But that I actually didn't know.

46:17.160 --> 46:20.160
 I mean, I just talked now a lot to the players

46:20.160 --> 46:23.360
 that we work with, TLO and Mana, and they said, oh yeah,

46:23.360 --> 46:24.720
 Protoss is actually, people think,

46:24.720 --> 46:26.360
 is actually one of the easiest races.

46:26.360 --> 46:28.840
 So perhaps the easier, that doesn't

46:28.840 --> 46:32.680
 mean that it's obviously professional players

46:32.680 --> 46:34.120
 excel at the three races.

46:34.120 --> 46:37.560
 And there's never a race that dominates

46:37.560 --> 46:38.800
 for a very long time anyway.

46:38.800 --> 46:41.680
 So if you look at the top, I don't know, 100 in the world,

46:41.680 --> 46:44.280
 is there one race that dominates that list?

46:44.280 --> 46:46.840
 It would be hard to know because it depends on the regions.

46:46.840 --> 46:50.600
 I think it's pretty equal in terms of distribution.

46:50.600 --> 46:53.360
 And Blizzard wants it to be equal.

46:53.360 --> 46:56.280
 They wouldn't want one race like Protoss

46:56.280 --> 46:59.880
 to not be representative in the top place.

46:59.880 --> 47:03.800
 So definitely, they tried it to be balanced.

47:03.800 --> 47:07.280
 So then maybe the opposite race of Protoss is Zerg.

47:07.280 --> 47:11.680
 Zerg is a race where you just kind of expand and take over

47:11.680 --> 47:14.360
 as many resources as you can, and they

47:14.360 --> 47:17.760
 have a very high capacity to regenerate their units.

47:17.760 --> 47:20.920
 So if you have an army, it's not that valuable in terms

47:20.920 --> 47:23.920
 of losing the whole army is not a big deal as Zerg

47:23.920 --> 47:25.840
 because you can then rebuild it.

47:25.840 --> 47:28.320
 And given that you generally accumulate

47:28.320 --> 47:31.800
 a huge bank of resources, Zergs typically

47:31.800 --> 47:34.200
 play by applying a lot of pressure,

47:34.200 --> 47:37.040
 maybe losing their whole army, but then rebuilding it

47:37.040 --> 47:37.920
 quickly.

47:37.920 --> 47:42.560
 So although, of course, every race, I mean, there's never,

47:42.560 --> 47:43.960
 I mean, they're pretty diverse.

47:43.960 --> 47:45.320
 I mean, there are some units in Zerg that

47:45.320 --> 47:47.160
 are technologically advanced, and they do

47:47.160 --> 47:48.760
 some very interesting spells.

47:48.760 --> 47:51.360
 And there's some units in Protoss that are less valuable,

47:51.360 --> 47:53.480
 and you could lose a lot of them and rebuild them,

47:53.480 --> 47:55.080
 and it wouldn't be a big deal.

47:55.080 --> 47:57.840
 All right, so maybe I'm missing out.

47:57.840 --> 48:01.680
 Maybe I'm going to say some dumb stuff, but summary

48:01.680 --> 48:02.520
 of strategy.

48:02.520 --> 48:05.720
 So first, there's collection of a lot of resources.

48:05.720 --> 48:06.560
 That's one option.

48:06.560 --> 48:11.560
 The other one is expanding, so building other bases.

48:11.920 --> 48:15.640
 Then the other is obviously building units

48:15.640 --> 48:17.160
 and attacking with those units.

48:17.160 --> 48:20.640
 And then I don't know what else there is.

48:20.640 --> 48:24.080
 Maybe there's the different timing of attacks,

48:24.080 --> 48:26.000
 like do I attack early, attack late?

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
 What are the different strategies that emerged

48:28.000 --> 48:29.120
 that you've learned about?

48:29.120 --> 48:31.360
 I've read that a bunch of people are super happy

48:31.360 --> 48:34.440
 that you guys have apparently, that Alpha Star apparently

48:34.440 --> 48:36.400
 has discovered that it's really good to,

48:36.400 --> 48:38.040
 what is it, saturate?

48:38.040 --> 48:39.600
 Oh yeah, the mineral line.

48:39.600 --> 48:41.400
 Yeah, the mineral line.

48:41.400 --> 48:42.240
 Yeah, yeah.

48:42.240 --> 48:45.640
 And that's for greedy amateur players like myself.

48:45.640 --> 48:47.520
 That's always been a good strategy.

48:47.520 --> 48:49.040
 You just build up a lot of money,

48:49.040 --> 48:53.320
 and it just feels good to just accumulate and accumulate.

48:53.320 --> 48:56.720
 So thank you for discovering that and validating all of us.

48:56.720 --> 48:59.240
 But is there other strategies that you discovered

48:59.240 --> 49:01.840
 that are interesting, unique to this game?

49:01.840 --> 49:05.280
 Yeah, so if you look at the kind of,

49:05.280 --> 49:06.480
 not being a StarCraft II player,

49:06.480 --> 49:08.080
 but of course StarCraft and StarCraft II

49:08.080 --> 49:11.040
 and real time strategy games in general are very similar.

49:12.120 --> 49:17.120
 I would classify perhaps the openings of the game.

49:17.560 --> 49:18.760
 They're very important.

49:18.760 --> 49:21.760
 And generally I would say there's two kinds of openings.

49:21.760 --> 49:23.400
 One that's a standard opening.

49:23.400 --> 49:28.400
 That's generally how players find sort of a balance

49:28.400 --> 49:32.880
 between risk and economy and building some units early on

49:32.880 --> 49:34.080
 so that they could defend,

49:34.080 --> 49:36.280
 but they're not too exposed basically,

49:36.280 --> 49:38.920
 but also expanding quite quickly.

49:38.920 --> 49:41.520
 So this would be kind of a standard opening.

49:41.520 --> 49:43.120
 And within a standard opening,

49:43.120 --> 49:45.320
 then what you do choose generally is

49:45.320 --> 49:47.840
 what technology are you aiming towards?

49:47.840 --> 49:49.760
 So there's a bit of rock, paper, scissors

49:49.760 --> 49:52.400
 of you could go for spaceships

49:52.400 --> 49:54.560
 or you could go for invisible units

49:54.560 --> 49:55.920
 or you could go for, I don't know,

49:55.920 --> 49:58.760
 like massive units that attack against certain kinds

49:58.760 --> 50:01.080
 of units, but they're weak against others.

50:01.080 --> 50:05.200
 So standard openings themselves have some choices

50:05.200 --> 50:06.960
 like rock, paper, scissors style.

50:06.960 --> 50:08.480
 Of course, if you scout and you're good

50:08.480 --> 50:10.520
 at guessing what the opponent is doing,

50:10.520 --> 50:12.240
 then you can play as an advantage

50:12.240 --> 50:13.920
 because if you know you're gonna play rock,

50:13.920 --> 50:15.920
 I mean, I'm gonna play paper obviously.

50:15.920 --> 50:18.600
 So you can imagine that normal standard games

50:18.600 --> 50:22.400
 in StarCraft looks like a continuous rock, paper,

50:22.400 --> 50:26.080
 scissors game where you guess what the distribution

50:26.080 --> 50:29.400
 of rock, paper, and scissors is from the enemy

50:29.400 --> 50:32.840
 and reacting accordingly to try to beat it

50:32.840 --> 50:36.880
 or put the paper out before he kind of changes his mind

50:36.880 --> 50:38.360
 from rock to scissors,

50:38.360 --> 50:39.960
 and then you would be in a weak position.

50:39.960 --> 50:41.640
 So, sorry to pause on that.

50:41.640 --> 50:42.800
 I didn't realize this element

50:42.800 --> 50:44.360
 because I know it's true with poker.

50:44.360 --> 50:45.840
 I know I looked at Labratus.

50:48.320 --> 50:51.720
 So you're also estimating trying to guess the distribution,

50:51.720 --> 50:53.680
 trying to better and better estimate the distribution

50:53.680 --> 50:55.560
 of what the opponent is likely to be doing.

50:55.560 --> 50:56.960
 Yeah, I mean, as a player,

50:56.960 --> 50:59.360
 you definitely wanna have a belief state

50:59.360 --> 51:02.520
 over what's up on the other side of the map.

51:02.520 --> 51:05.080
 And when your belief state becomes inaccurate,

51:05.080 --> 51:07.560
 when you start having that serious doubts,

51:07.560 --> 51:10.800
 whether he's gonna play something that you must know,

51:10.800 --> 51:11.920
 that's when you scout.

51:11.920 --> 51:14.040
 You wanna then gather information, right?

51:14.040 --> 51:15.960
 Is improving the accuracy of the belief

51:15.960 --> 51:19.360
 or improving the belief state part of the loss

51:19.360 --> 51:20.560
 that you're trying to optimize?

51:20.560 --> 51:22.360
 Or is it just a side effect?

51:22.360 --> 51:25.440
 It's implicit, but you could explicitly model it,

51:25.440 --> 51:27.880
 and it would be quite good at probably predicting

51:27.880 --> 51:30.000
 what's on the other side of the map.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.520
 But so far, it's all implicit.

51:32.520 --> 51:36.320
 There's no additional reward for predicting the enemy.

51:36.320 --> 51:38.400
 So there's these standard openings,

51:38.400 --> 51:41.240
 and then there's what people call cheese,

51:41.240 --> 51:42.400
 which is very interesting.

51:42.400 --> 51:46.360
 And AlphaStar sometimes really likes this kind of cheese.

51:46.360 --> 51:50.440
 These cheeses, what they are is kind of an all in strategy.

51:50.440 --> 51:53.240
 You're gonna do something sneaky.

51:53.240 --> 51:56.680
 You're gonna hide your own buildings

51:56.680 --> 51:58.200
 close to the enemy base,

51:58.200 --> 52:01.600
 or you're gonna go for hiding your technological buildings

52:01.600 --> 52:03.040
 so that you do invisible units

52:03.040 --> 52:06.040
 and the enemy just cannot react to detect it

52:06.040 --> 52:07.960
 and thus lose the game.

52:07.960 --> 52:10.000
 And there's quite a few of these cheeses

52:10.000 --> 52:11.760
 and variants of them.

52:11.760 --> 52:14.480
 And there it's where actually the belief state

52:14.480 --> 52:16.360
 becomes even more important.

52:16.360 --> 52:20.200
 Because if I scout your base and I see no buildings at all,

52:20.200 --> 52:22.480
 any human player knows something's up.

52:22.480 --> 52:23.320
 They might know, well,

52:23.320 --> 52:25.640
 you're hiding something close to my base.

52:25.640 --> 52:28.400
 Should I build suddenly a lot of units to defend?

52:28.400 --> 52:31.000
 Should I actually block my ramp with workers

52:31.000 --> 52:33.520
 so that you cannot come and destroy my base?

52:33.520 --> 52:35.680
 So there's all this is happening

52:35.680 --> 52:39.440
 and defending against cheeses is extremely important.

52:39.440 --> 52:40.800
 And in the AlphaStar League,

52:40.800 --> 52:45.080
 many agents actually develop some cheesy strategies.

52:45.080 --> 52:48.040
 And in the games we saw against TLO and Mana,

52:48.040 --> 52:49.240
 two out of the 10 agents

52:49.240 --> 52:51.760
 were actually doing these kind of strategies

52:51.760 --> 52:53.640
 which are cheesy strategies.

52:53.640 --> 52:55.600
 And then there's a variant of cheesy strategy

52:55.600 --> 52:57.360
 which is called all in.

52:57.360 --> 53:00.440
 So an all in strategy is not perhaps as drastic as,

53:00.440 --> 53:02.520
 oh, I'm gonna build cannons on your base

53:02.520 --> 53:03.840
 and then bring all my workers

53:03.840 --> 53:06.800
 and try to just disrupt your base and game over,

53:06.800 --> 53:08.760
 or GG as we say in StarCraft.

53:09.800 --> 53:11.960
 There's these kind of very cool things

53:11.960 --> 53:14.720
 that you can align precisely at a certain time mark.

53:14.720 --> 53:15.680
 So for instance,

53:15.680 --> 53:19.520
 you can generate exactly 10 unit composition

53:19.520 --> 53:21.440
 that is perfect, like five of this type,

53:21.440 --> 53:22.920
 five of this other type,

53:22.920 --> 53:24.360
 and align the upgrade

53:24.360 --> 53:27.240
 so that at four minutes and a half, let's say,

53:27.240 --> 53:30.600
 you have these 10 units and the upgrade just finished.

53:30.600 --> 53:33.960
 And at that point, that army is really scary.

53:33.960 --> 53:36.440
 And unless the enemy really knows what's going on,

53:36.440 --> 53:40.240
 if you push, you might then have an advantage

53:40.240 --> 53:42.440
 because maybe the enemy is doing something more standard,

53:42.440 --> 53:45.760
 it expanded too much, it developed too much economy,

53:45.760 --> 53:49.720
 and it trade off badly against having defenses,

53:49.720 --> 53:51.120
 and the enemy will lose.

53:51.120 --> 53:53.640
 But it's called all in because if you don't win,

53:53.640 --> 53:55.040
 then you're gonna lose.

53:55.040 --> 53:57.960
 So you see players that do these kinds of strategies,

53:57.960 --> 54:00.000
 if they don't succeed, game is not over.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.200
 I mean, they still have a base

54:01.200 --> 54:02.840
 and they still gathering minerals,

54:02.840 --> 54:04.760
 but they will just GG out of the game

54:04.760 --> 54:06.760
 because they know, well, game is over.

54:06.760 --> 54:08.840
 I gambled and I failed.

54:08.840 --> 54:12.480
 So if we start entering the game theoretic aspects

54:12.480 --> 54:15.200
 of the game, it's really rich and it's really,

54:15.200 --> 54:17.960
 that's why it also makes it quite entertaining to watch.

54:17.960 --> 54:21.760
 Even if I don't play, I still enjoy watching the game.

54:21.760 --> 54:26.760
 But the agents are trying to do this mostly implicitly.

54:26.880 --> 54:29.120
 But one element that we improved in self play

54:29.120 --> 54:31.400
 is creating the Alpha Star League.

54:31.400 --> 54:34.640
 And the Alpha Star League is not pure self play.

54:34.640 --> 54:37.960
 It's trying to create a different personalities of agents

54:37.960 --> 54:41.560
 so that some of them will become cheesy agents.

54:41.560 --> 54:44.440
 Some of them might become very economical, very greedy,

54:44.440 --> 54:46.240
 like getting all the resources,

54:46.240 --> 54:48.840
 but then being maybe early on, they're gonna be weak,

54:48.840 --> 54:51.080
 but later on, they're gonna be very strong.

54:51.080 --> 54:53.480
 And by creating this personality of agents,

54:53.480 --> 54:55.440
 which sometimes it just happens naturally

54:55.440 --> 54:58.280
 that you can see kind of an evolution of agents

54:58.280 --> 55:00.840
 that given the previous generation,

55:00.840 --> 55:02.000
 they train against all of them

55:02.000 --> 55:04.400
 and then they generate kind of the perfect counter

55:04.400 --> 55:05.800
 to that distribution.

55:05.800 --> 55:09.320
 But these agents, you must have them in the populations

55:09.320 --> 55:11.320
 because if you don't have them,

55:11.320 --> 55:13.440
 you're not covered against these things.

55:13.440 --> 55:17.120
 You wanna create all sorts of the opponents

55:17.120 --> 55:18.680
 that you will find in the wild.

55:18.680 --> 55:23.120
 So you can be exposed to these cheeses, early aggression,

55:23.120 --> 55:25.760
 later aggression, more expansions,

55:25.760 --> 55:29.600
 dropping units in your base from the side, all these things.

55:29.600 --> 55:32.800
 And pure self play is getting a bit stuck

55:32.800 --> 55:36.240
 at finding some subset of these, but not all of these.

55:36.240 --> 55:38.400
 So the Alpha Star League is a way

55:38.400 --> 55:41.600
 to kind of do an ensemble of agents

55:41.600 --> 55:43.520
 that they're all playing in a league,

55:43.520 --> 55:45.560
 much like people play on Battle.net, right?

55:45.560 --> 55:47.480
 They play, you play against someone

55:47.480 --> 55:50.280
 who does a new cool strategy and you immediately,

55:50.280 --> 55:53.080
 oh my God, I wanna try it, I wanna play again.

55:53.080 --> 55:57.600
 And this to me was another critical part of the problem,

55:57.600 --> 56:01.280
 which was, can we create a Battle.net for agents?

56:01.280 --> 56:03.560
 And that's kind of what the Alpha Star League really is.

56:03.560 --> 56:04.400
 That's fascinating.

56:04.400 --> 56:06.920
 And where they stick to their different strategies.

56:06.920 --> 56:09.880
 Yeah, wow, that's really, really interesting.

56:09.880 --> 56:13.240
 But that said, you were fortunate enough

56:13.240 --> 56:16.280
 or just skilled enough to win five, zero.

56:17.320 --> 56:19.280
 And so how hard is it to win?

56:19.280 --> 56:20.320
 I mean, that's not the goal.

56:20.320 --> 56:21.880
 I guess, I don't know what the goal is.

56:21.880 --> 56:25.400
 The goal should be to win majority, not five, zero,

56:25.400 --> 56:29.360
 but how hard is it in general to win all matchups

56:29.360 --> 56:31.080
 on a one V one?

56:31.080 --> 56:33.600
 So that's a very interesting question

56:33.600 --> 56:38.600
 because once you see Alpha Star and superficially

56:38.680 --> 56:40.520
 you think, well, okay, it won.

56:40.520 --> 56:42.960
 Let's, if you sum all the games like 10 to one, right?

56:42.960 --> 56:46.280
 It lost the game that it played with the camera interface.

56:46.280 --> 56:48.760
 You might think, well, that's done, right?

56:48.760 --> 56:50.800
 It's superhuman at the game.

56:50.800 --> 56:54.760
 And that's not really the claim we really can make actually.

56:55.960 --> 56:58.800
 The claim is we beat a professional gamer

56:58.800 --> 57:00.080
 for the first time.

57:00.080 --> 57:02.440
 StarCraft has really been a thing

57:02.440 --> 57:04.080
 that has been going on for a few years,

57:04.080 --> 57:09.080
 but a moment like this had not occurred before yet.

57:09.480 --> 57:12.360
 But are these agents impossible to beat?

57:12.360 --> 57:13.400
 Absolutely not, right?

57:13.400 --> 57:17.320
 So that's a bit what's kind of the difference is

57:17.320 --> 57:19.520
 the agents play at grandmaster level.

57:19.520 --> 57:21.480
 They definitely understand the game enough

57:21.480 --> 57:24.920
 to play extremely well, but are they unbeatable?

57:24.920 --> 57:26.600
 Do they play perfect?

57:26.600 --> 57:29.280
 No, and actually in StarCraft,

57:29.280 --> 57:32.160
 because of these sneaky strategies,

57:32.160 --> 57:34.920
 it's always possible that you might take a huge risk

57:34.920 --> 57:36.880
 sometimes, but you might get wins, right?

57:36.880 --> 57:38.160
 Out of this.

57:38.160 --> 57:41.560
 So I think that as a domain,

57:41.560 --> 57:43.320
 it still has a lot of opportunities,

57:43.320 --> 57:45.840
 not only because of course we wanna learn

57:45.840 --> 57:47.720
 with less experience, we would like to,

57:47.720 --> 57:49.680
 I mean, if I learned to play Protoss,

57:49.680 --> 57:52.520
 I can play Terran and learn it much quicker

57:52.520 --> 57:53.640
 than Alpha Star can, right?

57:53.640 --> 57:56.720
 So there are obvious interesting research challenges

57:56.720 --> 58:01.720
 as well, but even as the raw performance goes,

58:02.320 --> 58:05.200
 really the claim here can be we are at pro level

58:05.200 --> 58:08.320
 or at high grandmaster level,

58:08.320 --> 58:13.320
 but obviously the players also did not know what to expect,

58:13.440 --> 58:14.280
 right?

58:14.280 --> 58:15.960
 Their prior distribution was a bit off

58:15.960 --> 58:19.400
 because they played this kind of new like alien brain

58:19.400 --> 58:21.000
 as they like to say it, right?

58:21.000 --> 58:24.120
 And that's what makes it exciting for them.

58:24.120 --> 58:27.160
 But also I think if you look at the games closely,

58:27.160 --> 58:30.680
 you see there were weaknesses in some points,

58:30.680 --> 58:32.520
 maybe Alpha Star did not scout,

58:32.520 --> 58:35.240
 or if it had invisible units going against

58:35.240 --> 58:37.400
 at certain points, it wouldn't have known

58:37.400 --> 58:38.800
 and it would have been bad.

58:38.800 --> 58:42.160
 So there's still quite a lot of work to do,

58:42.160 --> 58:44.680
 but it's really a very exciting moment for us

58:44.680 --> 58:48.400
 to be seeing, wow, a single neural net on a GPU

58:48.400 --> 58:50.240
 is actually playing against these guys

58:50.240 --> 58:51.280
 who are amazing.

58:51.280 --> 58:52.920
 I mean, you have to see them play in life.

58:52.920 --> 58:55.040
 They're really, really amazing players.

58:55.040 --> 58:59.320
 Yeah, I'm sure there must be a guy in Poland

58:59.320 --> 59:02.000
 somewhere right now training his butt off

59:02.000 --> 59:05.920
 to make sure that this never happens again with Alpha Star.

59:05.920 --> 59:09.080
 So that's really exciting in terms of Alpha Star

59:09.080 --> 59:11.520
 having some holes to exploit, which is great.

59:11.520 --> 59:13.720
 And then we build on top of each other

59:13.720 --> 59:16.360
 and it feels like StarCraft on let go,

59:16.360 --> 59:20.640
 even if you win, it's still not,

59:20.640 --> 59:23.120
 there's so many different dimensions

59:23.120 --> 59:24.200
 in which you can explore.

59:24.200 --> 59:25.560
 So that's really, really interesting.

59:25.560 --> 59:28.520
 Do you think there's a ceiling to Alpha Star?

59:28.520 --> 59:31.360
 You've said that it hasn't reached,

59:31.360 --> 59:32.840
 you know, this is a big,

59:32.840 --> 59:35.520
 wait, let me actually just pause for a second.

59:35.520 --> 59:40.200
 How did it feel to come here to this point,

59:40.200 --> 59:42.240
 to beat a top professional player?

59:42.240 --> 59:44.600
 Like that night, I mean, you know,

59:44.600 --> 59:47.120
 Olympic athletes have their gold medal, right?

59:47.120 --> 59:48.840
 This is your gold medal in a sense.

59:48.840 --> 59:50.400
 Sure, you're cited a lot,

59:50.400 --> 59:53.120
 you've published a lot of prestigious papers, whatever,

59:53.120 --> 59:55.280
 but this is like a win.

59:55.280 --> 59:56.480
 How did it feel?

59:56.480 --> 59:59.440
 I mean, it was, for me, it was unbelievable

59:59.440 --> 1:00:03.920
 because first the win itself,

1:00:03.920 --> 1:00:05.080
 I mean, it was so exciting.

1:00:05.080 --> 1:00:10.080
 I mean, so looking back to those last days of 2018 really,

1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:13.120
 that's when the games were played.

1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:15.240
 I'm sure I look back at that moment, I'll say,

1:00:15.240 --> 1:00:18.000
 oh my God, I want to be in a project like that.

1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:21.120
 It's like, I already feel the nostalgia of like,

1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:24.240
 yeah, that was huge in terms of the energy

1:00:24.240 --> 1:00:26.360
 and the team effort that went into it.

1:00:26.360 --> 1:00:29.240
 And so in that sense, as soon as it happened,

1:00:29.240 --> 1:00:31.280
 I already knew it was kind of,

1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:33.000
 I was losing it a little bit.

1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:36.320
 So it is almost like sad that it happened and oh my God,

1:00:36.320 --> 1:00:41.320
 but on the other hand, it also verifies the approach.

1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:43.800
 But to me also, there's so many challenges

1:00:43.800 --> 1:00:46.080
 and interesting aspects of intelligence

1:00:46.080 --> 1:00:49.840
 that even though we can train a neural network

1:00:49.840 --> 1:00:52.680
 to play at the level of the best humans,

1:00:52.680 --> 1:00:54.200
 there's still so many challenges.

1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:55.680
 So for me, it's also like, well,

1:00:55.680 --> 1:00:57.440
 this is really an amazing achievement,

1:00:57.440 --> 1:00:59.920
 but I already was also thinking about next steps.

1:00:59.920 --> 1:01:04.080
 I mean, as I said, these Asians play Protoss versus Protoss,

1:01:04.080 --> 1:01:07.200
 but they should be able to play a different race

1:01:07.200 --> 1:01:08.120
 much quicker, right?

1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:10.640
 So that would be an amazing achievement.

1:01:10.640 --> 1:01:13.360
 Some people call this meta reinforcement learning,

1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:15.200
 meta learning and so on, right?

1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:18.960
 So there's so many possibilities after that moment,

1:01:18.960 --> 1:01:21.520
 but the moment itself, it really felt great.

1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:27.760
 We had this bet, so I'm kind of a pessimist in general.

1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:29.920
 So I kind of send an email to the team.

1:01:29.920 --> 1:01:33.680
 I said, okay, let's against TLO first, right?

1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:35.120
 Like what's gonna be the result?

1:01:35.120 --> 1:01:38.680
 And I really thought we would lose like five zero, right?

1:01:38.680 --> 1:01:43.680
 We had some calibration made against the 5,000 MMR player.

1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:47.360
 TLO was much stronger than that player,

1:01:47.360 --> 1:01:50.040
 even if he played Protoss, which is his off race.

1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:53.120
 But yeah, I was not imagining we would win.

1:01:53.120 --> 1:01:55.600
 So for me, that was just kind of a test run or something.

1:01:55.600 --> 1:01:59.000
 And then it really kind of, he was really surprised.

1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:04.000
 And unbelievably, we went to this bar to celebrate

1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:08.360
 and Dave tells me, well, why don't we invite someone

1:02:08.360 --> 1:02:10.960
 who is a thousand MMR stronger in Protoss,

1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:12.520
 like actual Protoss player,

1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:16.160
 like that it turned up being Mana, right?

1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:19.360
 And we had some drinks and I said, sure, why not?

1:02:19.360 --> 1:02:20.200
 But then I thought, well,

1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:22.040
 that's really gonna be impossible to beat.

1:02:22.040 --> 1:02:24.560
 I mean, even because it's so much ahead,

1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:28.400
 a thousand MMR is really like 99% probability

1:02:28.400 --> 1:02:33.040
 that Mana would beat TLO as Protoss versus Protoss, right?

1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:34.200
 So we did that.

1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:38.960
 And to me, the second game was much more important,

1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:42.080
 even though a lot of uncertainty kind of disappeared

1:02:42.080 --> 1:02:43.640
 after we kind of beat TLO.

1:02:43.640 --> 1:02:45.640
 I mean, he is a professional player.

1:02:45.640 --> 1:02:46.840
 So that was kind of, oh,

1:02:46.840 --> 1:02:49.720
 but that's really a very nice achievement.

1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:51.760
 But Mana really was at the top

1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:53.840
 and you could see he played much better,

1:02:53.840 --> 1:02:55.360
 but our agents got much better too.

1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:59.480
 So it's like, ah, and then after the first game,

1:02:59.480 --> 1:03:00.880
 I said, if we take a single game,

1:03:00.880 --> 1:03:02.720
 at least we can say we beat a game.

1:03:02.720 --> 1:03:04.320
 I mean, even if we don't beat the series,

1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:06.920
 for me, that was a huge relief.

1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:09.200
 And I mean, I remember the hugging demis.

1:03:09.200 --> 1:03:10.840
 And I mean, it was really like,

1:03:10.840 --> 1:03:14.160
 this moment for me will resonate forever as a researcher.

1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:15.360
 And I mean, as a person,

1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:18.240
 and yeah, it's a really like great accomplishment.

1:03:18.240 --> 1:03:21.360
 And it was great also to be there with the team in the room.

1:03:21.360 --> 1:03:23.040
 I don't know if you saw like this.

1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:24.720
 So it was really like.

1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:25.960
 I mean, from my perspective,

1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:29.840
 the other interesting thing is just like watching Kasparov,

1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:33.720
 watching Mana was also interesting

1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:36.120
 because he didn't, he has kind of a loss of words.

1:03:36.120 --> 1:03:38.600
 I mean, whenever you lose, I've done a lot of sports.

1:03:38.600 --> 1:03:43.520
 You sometimes say excuses, you look for reasons.

1:03:43.520 --> 1:03:46.240
 And he couldn't really come up with reasons.

1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:50.000
 I mean, so with the off race for Protoss,

1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.280
 you could say, well, it felt awkward, it wasn't,

1:03:52.280 --> 1:03:55.160
 but here it was just beaten.

1:03:55.160 --> 1:03:57.920
 And it was beautiful to look at a human being

1:03:57.920 --> 1:04:00.240
 being superseded by an AI system.

1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:04.400
 I mean, it's a beautiful moment for researchers, so.

1:04:04.400 --> 1:04:05.960
 Yeah, for sure it was.

1:04:05.960 --> 1:04:09.920
 I mean, probably the highlight of my career so far

1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:11.760
 because of its uniqueness and coolness.

1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:14.240
 And I don't know, I mean, it's obviously, as you said,

1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:16.200
 you can look at papers, citations and so on,

1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:19.240
 but these really is like a testament

1:04:19.240 --> 1:04:21.200
 of the whole machine learning approach

1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:24.640
 and using games to advance technology.

1:04:24.640 --> 1:04:26.840
 I mean, it really was,

1:04:26.840 --> 1:04:28.840
 everything came together at that moment.

1:04:28.840 --> 1:04:29.840
 That's really the summary.

1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:34.040
 Also on the other side, it's a popularization of AI too,

1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:38.200
 because it's just like traveling to the moon and so on.

1:04:38.200 --> 1:04:41.000
 I mean, this is where a very large community of people

1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.120
 that don't really know AI,

1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:45.200
 they get to really interact with it.

1:04:45.200 --> 1:04:46.040
 Which is very important.

1:04:46.040 --> 1:04:48.640
 I mean, we must, you know,

1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:51.400
 writing papers helps our peers, researchers,

1:04:51.400 --> 1:04:52.520
 to understand what we're doing.

1:04:52.520 --> 1:04:55.880
 But I think AI is becoming mature enough

1:04:55.880 --> 1:04:59.000
 that we must sort of try to explain what it is.

1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:01.440
 And perhaps through games is an obvious way

1:05:01.440 --> 1:05:03.640
 because these games always had built in AI.

1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:07.680
 So it may be everyone experience an AI playing a video game,

1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:08.520
 even if they don't know,

1:05:08.520 --> 1:05:10.240
 because there's always some scripted element

1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:13.040
 and some people might even call that AI already, right?

1:05:13.920 --> 1:05:16.320
 So what are other applications

1:05:16.320 --> 1:05:19.080
 of the approaches underlying AlphaStar

1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:20.280
 that you see happening?

1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:22.360
 There's a lot of echoes of, you said,

1:05:22.360 --> 1:05:25.440
 transformer of language modeling and so on.

1:05:25.440 --> 1:05:27.120
 Have you already started thinking

1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:30.400
 where the breakthroughs in AlphaStar

1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:32.280
 get expanded to other applications?

1:05:32.280 --> 1:05:34.640
 Right, so I thought about a few things

1:05:34.640 --> 1:05:37.280
 for like kind of next month, next years.

1:05:38.440 --> 1:05:41.480
 The main thing I'm thinking about actually is what's next

1:05:41.480 --> 1:05:43.160
 as a kind of a grand challenge.

1:05:43.160 --> 1:05:47.120
 Because for me, like we've seen Atari

1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:50.280
 and then there's like the sort of three dimensional walls

1:05:50.280 --> 1:05:52.520
 that we've seen also like pretty good performance

1:05:52.520 --> 1:05:54.120
 from these capture the flag agents

1:05:54.120 --> 1:05:56.440
 that also some people at DeepMind and elsewhere

1:05:56.440 --> 1:05:57.600
 are working on.

1:05:57.600 --> 1:05:59.600
 We've also seen some amazing results on like,

1:05:59.600 --> 1:06:03.280
 for instance, Dota 2, which is also a very complicated game.

1:06:03.280 --> 1:06:05.960
 So for me, like the main thing I'm thinking about

1:06:05.960 --> 1:06:07.960
 is what's next in terms of challenge.

1:06:07.960 --> 1:06:12.960
 So as a researcher, I see sort of two tensions

1:06:12.960 --> 1:06:16.760
 between research and then applications or areas

1:06:16.760 --> 1:06:18.480
 or domains where you apply them.

1:06:18.480 --> 1:06:20.480
 So on the one hand, we've done,

1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:23.320
 thanks to the application of StarCraft is very hard.

1:06:23.320 --> 1:06:25.600
 We developed some techniques, some new research

1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:27.480
 that now we could look at elsewhere.

1:06:27.480 --> 1:06:30.520
 Like are there other applications where we can apply these?

1:06:30.520 --> 1:06:32.880
 And the obvious ones, absolutely.

1:06:32.880 --> 1:06:37.440
 You can think of feeding back to sort of the community

1:06:37.440 --> 1:06:40.240
 we took from, which was mostly sequence modeling

1:06:40.240 --> 1:06:41.680
 or natural language processing.

1:06:41.680 --> 1:06:46.120
 So we've developed and extended things from the transformer

1:06:46.120 --> 1:06:48.120
 and we use pointer networks.

1:06:48.120 --> 1:06:51.280
 We combine LSTM and transformers in interesting ways.

1:06:51.280 --> 1:06:54.200
 So that's perhaps the kind of lowest hanging fruit

1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:57.600
 of feeding back to now a different field

1:06:57.600 --> 1:07:00.880
 of machine learning that's not playing video games.

1:07:00.880 --> 1:07:05.680
 Let me go old school and jump to Mr. Alan Turing.

1:07:05.680 --> 1:07:09.920
 So the Turing test is a natural language test,

1:07:09.920 --> 1:07:11.560
 a conversational test.

1:07:11.560 --> 1:07:15.760
 What's your thought of it as a test for intelligence?

1:07:15.760 --> 1:07:17.320
 Do you think it is a grand challenge

1:07:17.320 --> 1:07:18.920
 that's worthy of undertaking?

1:07:18.920 --> 1:07:22.440
 Maybe if it is, would you reformulate it or phrase it

1:07:22.440 --> 1:07:23.640
 somehow differently?

1:07:23.640 --> 1:07:25.600
 Right, so I really love the Turing test

1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:29.480
 because I also like sequences and language understanding.

1:07:29.480 --> 1:07:32.120
 And in fact, some of the early work

1:07:32.120 --> 1:07:33.640
 we did in machine translation, we

1:07:33.640 --> 1:07:38.680
 tried to apply to kind of a neural chatbot, which obviously

1:07:38.680 --> 1:07:42.200
 would never pass the Turing test because it was very limited.

1:07:42.200 --> 1:07:45.160
 But it is a very fascinating idea

1:07:45.160 --> 1:07:49.760
 that you could really have an AI that

1:07:49.760 --> 1:07:53.840
 would be indistinguishable from humans in terms of asking

1:07:53.840 --> 1:07:56.000
 or conversing with it.

1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:00.680
 So I think the test itself seems very nice.

1:08:00.680 --> 1:08:02.560
 And it's kind of well defined, actually,

1:08:02.560 --> 1:08:04.840
 like the passing it or not.

1:08:04.840 --> 1:08:06.520
 I think there's quite a few rules

1:08:06.520 --> 1:08:09.080
 that feel pretty simple.

1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:14.680
 And I think they have these competitions every year.

1:08:14.680 --> 1:08:15.920
 Yes, there's the Lebner Prize.

1:08:15.920 --> 1:08:22.240
 But I don't know if you've seen the kind of bots

1:08:22.240 --> 1:08:24.120
 that emerge from that competition.

1:08:24.120 --> 1:08:27.960
 They're not quite as what you would.

1:08:27.960 --> 1:08:30.640
 So it feels like that there's weaknesses with the way Turing

1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:31.400
 formulated it.

1:08:31.400 --> 1:08:34.960
 It needs to be that the definition

1:08:34.960 --> 1:08:39.880
 of a genuine, rich, fulfilling human conversation,

1:08:39.880 --> 1:08:41.640
 it needs to be something else.

1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:44.880
 Like the Alexa Prize, which I'm not as well familiar with,

1:08:44.880 --> 1:08:46.440
 has tried to define that more, I think,

1:08:46.440 --> 1:08:48.560
 by saying you have to continue keeping

1:08:48.560 --> 1:08:52.200
 a conversation for 30 minutes, something like that.

1:08:52.200 --> 1:08:55.480
 So basically forcing the agent not to just fool,

1:08:55.480 --> 1:08:57.600
 but to have an engaging conversation kind of thing.

1:09:02.320 --> 1:09:06.520
 Have you thought about this problem richly?

1:09:06.520 --> 1:09:10.720
 And if you have in general, how far away are we from?

1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:14.160
 You worked a lot on language understanding,

1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:16.640
 language generation, but the full dialogue,

1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:19.880
 the conversation, just sitting at the bar

1:09:19.880 --> 1:09:21.680
 having a couple of beers for an hour,

1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:22.920
 that kind of conversation.

1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:23.640
 Have you thought about it?

1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:25.160
 Yeah, so I think you touched here

1:09:25.160 --> 1:09:28.960
 on the critical point, which is feasibility.

1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:32.840
 So there's a great essay by Hamming,

1:09:32.840 --> 1:09:37.280
 which describes sort of grand challenges of physics.

1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:41.040
 And he argues that, well, OK, for instance,

1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:44.680
 teleportation or time travel are great grand challenges

1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:46.600
 of physics, but there's no attacks.

1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:50.360
 We really don't know or cannot kind of make any progress.

1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:53.320
 So that's why most physicists and so on,

1:09:53.320 --> 1:09:55.320
 they don't work on these in their PhDs

1:09:55.320 --> 1:09:57.840
 and as part of their careers.

1:09:57.840 --> 1:10:00.880
 So I see the Turing test, in the full Turing test,

1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:02.720
 as a bit still too early.

1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:06.680
 Like I think we're, especially with the current trend

1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:10.040
 of deep learning language models,

1:10:10.040 --> 1:10:11.600
 we've seen some amazing examples.

1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:14.360
 I think GPT2 being the most recent one, which

1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:15.760
 is very impressive.

1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:21.000
 But to understand to fully solve passing or fooling a human

1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.440
 to think that there's a human on the other side,

1:10:23.440 --> 1:10:24.880
 I think we're quite far.

1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:27.240
 So as a result, I don't see myself

1:10:27.240 --> 1:10:30.480
 and I probably would not recommend people doing a PhD

1:10:30.480 --> 1:10:32.360
 on solving the Turing test because it just

1:10:32.360 --> 1:10:35.400
 feels it's kind of too early or too hard of a problem.

1:10:35.400 --> 1:10:37.800
 Yeah, but that said, you said the exact same thing

1:10:37.800 --> 1:10:40.560
 about StarCraft about a few years ago.

1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:41.040
 Indeed.

1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:41.560
 To Demis.

1:10:41.560 --> 1:10:46.200
 So you'll probably also be the person who passes

1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:48.120
 the Turing test in three years.

1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:50.920
 I mean, I think that, yeah.

1:10:50.920 --> 1:10:52.040
 So we have this on record.

1:10:52.040 --> 1:10:52.640
 This is nice.

1:10:52.640 --> 1:10:53.520
 It's true.

1:10:53.520 --> 1:10:56.560
 I mean, it's true that progress sometimes

1:10:56.560 --> 1:10:57.800
 is a bit unpredictable.

1:10:57.800 --> 1:10:59.200
 I really wouldn't have not.

1:10:59.200 --> 1:11:02.440
 Even six months ago, I would not have predicted the level

1:11:02.440 --> 1:11:06.160
 that we see that these agents can deliver at grandmaster

1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:07.800
 level.

1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:10.040
 But I have worked on language enough.

1:11:10.040 --> 1:11:13.600
 And basically, my concern is not that something could happen,

1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:16.400
 a breakthrough could happen that would bring us to solving

1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:19.160
 or passing the Turing test, is that I just

1:11:19.160 --> 1:11:24.120
 think the statistical approach to it is not going to cut it.

1:11:24.120 --> 1:11:28.240
 So we need a breakthrough, which is great for the community.

1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:31.800
 But given that, I think there's quite more uncertainty.

1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:36.120
 Whereas for StarCraft, I knew what the steps would

1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:38.120
 be to get us there.

1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:41.560
 I think it was clear that using the imitation learning part

1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:44.320
 and then using this battle net for agents

1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:45.440
 were going to be key.

1:11:45.440 --> 1:11:48.280
 And it turned out that this was the case.

1:11:48.280 --> 1:11:51.560
 And a little more was needed, but not much more.

1:11:51.560 --> 1:11:53.640
 For Turing test, I just don't know

1:11:53.640 --> 1:11:56.080
 what the plan or execution plan would look like.

1:11:56.080 --> 1:12:00.680
 So that's why I myself working on it as a grand challenge

1:12:00.680 --> 1:12:01.480
 is hard.

1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:03.880
 But there are quite a few sub challenges

1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:05.600
 that are related that you could say,

1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:09.040
 well, I mean, what if you create a great assistant

1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:11.400
 like Google already has, like the Google Assistant.

1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:13.120
 So can we make it better?

1:12:13.120 --> 1:12:15.400
 And can we make it fully neural and so on?

1:12:15.400 --> 1:12:17.440
 That I start to believe maybe we're

1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:20.640
 reaching a point where we should attempt these challenges.

1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:23.520
 I like this conversation so much because it echoes very much

1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:24.840
 the StarCraft conversation.

1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:26.880
 It's exactly how you approach StarCraft.

1:12:26.880 --> 1:12:29.600
 Let's break it down into small pieces and solve those.

1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:31.320
 And you end up solving the whole game.

1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:31.920
 Great.

1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:34.120
 But that said, you're behind some

1:12:34.120 --> 1:12:37.960
 of the biggest pieces of work in deep learning

1:12:37.960 --> 1:12:40.360
 in the last several years.

1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:42.280
 So you mentioned some limits.

1:12:42.280 --> 1:12:44.880
 What do you think of the current limits of deep learning?

1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:47.160
 And how do we overcome those limits?

1:12:47.160 --> 1:12:50.160
 So if I had to actually use a single word

1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:53.240
 to define the main challenge in deep learning,

1:12:53.240 --> 1:12:55.120
 it's a challenge that probably has

1:12:55.120 --> 1:12:56.960
 been the challenge for many years.

1:12:56.960 --> 1:12:59.720
 And it's that of generalization.

1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:04.560
 So what that means is that all that we're doing

1:13:04.560 --> 1:13:06.720
 is fitting functions to data.

1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:12.160
 And when the data we see is not from the same distribution,

1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:14.520
 or even if there are some times that it

1:13:14.520 --> 1:13:17.320
 is very close to distribution, but because

1:13:17.320 --> 1:13:20.240
 of the way we train it with limited samples,

1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:23.560
 we then get to this stage where we just

1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:27.800
 don't see generalization as much as we can generalize.

1:13:27.800 --> 1:13:31.240
 And I think adversarial examples are a clear example of this.

1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:34.640
 But if you study machine learning and literature,

1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:38.280
 and the reason why SVMs came very popular

1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:40.040
 were because they were dealing and they

1:13:40.040 --> 1:13:42.640
 had some guarantees about generalization, which

1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:45.600
 is unseen data or out of distribution,

1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:48.280
 or even within distribution where you take an image adding

1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:51.360
 a bit of noise, these models fail.

1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:56.680
 So I think, really, I don't see a lot of progress

1:13:56.680 --> 1:14:00.520
 on generalization in the strong generalization

1:14:00.520 --> 1:14:01.800
 sense of the word.

1:14:01.800 --> 1:14:05.960
 I think our neural networks, you can always

1:14:05.960 --> 1:14:11.040
 find design examples that will make their outputs arbitrary,

1:14:11.040 --> 1:14:15.600
 which is not good because we humans would never

1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:17.880
 be fooled by these kind of images

1:14:17.880 --> 1:14:19.880
 or manipulation of the image.

1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:21.760
 And if you look at the mathematics,

1:14:21.760 --> 1:14:23.960
 you kind of understand this is a bunch of matrices

1:14:23.960 --> 1:14:26.160
 multiplied together.

1:14:26.160 --> 1:14:28.040
 There's probably numerics and instability

1:14:28.040 --> 1:14:30.920
 that you can just find corner cases.

1:14:30.920 --> 1:14:35.240
 So I think that's really the underlying topic many times

1:14:35.240 --> 1:14:40.120
 we see when even at the grand stage of Turing test

1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:44.520
 generalization, if you start passing the Turing test,

1:14:44.520 --> 1:14:48.840
 should it be in English or should it be in any language?

1:14:48.840 --> 1:14:53.200
 As a human, if you ask something in a different language,

1:14:53.200 --> 1:14:54.920
 you actually will go and do some research

1:14:54.920 --> 1:14:57.720
 and try to translate it and so on.

1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:01.000
 Should the Turing test include that?

1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:02.920
 And it's really a difficult problem

1:15:02.920 --> 1:15:05.480
 and very fascinating and very mysterious, actually.

1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:06.280
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:15:06.280 --> 1:15:10.760
 But do you think if you were to try to solve it,

1:15:10.760 --> 1:15:14.240
 can you not grow the size of data intelligently

1:15:14.240 --> 1:15:17.080
 in such a way that the distribution of your training

1:15:17.080 --> 1:15:20.880
 set does include the entirety of the testing set?

1:15:20.880 --> 1:15:21.760
 Is that one path?

1:15:21.760 --> 1:15:23.840
 The other path is totally a new methodology.

1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:24.960
 It's not statistical.

1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:27.920
 So a path that has worked well, and it worked well

1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:30.720
 in StarCraft and in machine translation and in languages,

1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:32.800
 scaling up the data and the model.

1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:38.480
 And that's kind of been maybe the only single formula that

1:15:38.480 --> 1:15:40.480
 still delivers today in deep learning, right?

1:15:40.480 --> 1:15:44.960
 It's that data scale and model scale really

1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:47.040
 do more and more of the things that we thought,

1:15:47.040 --> 1:15:49.240
 oh, there's no way it can generalize to these,

1:15:49.240 --> 1:15:51.320
 or there's no way it can generalize to that.

1:15:51.320 --> 1:15:54.760
 But I don't think fundamentally it will be solved with this.

1:15:54.760 --> 1:15:59.600
 And for instance, I'm really liking some style or approach

1:15:59.600 --> 1:16:02.120
 that would not only have neural networks,

1:16:02.120 --> 1:16:06.360
 but it would have programs or some discrete decision making,

1:16:06.360 --> 1:16:10.320
 because there is where I feel there's a bit more.

1:16:10.320 --> 1:16:13.520
 I mean, the best example, I think, for understanding this

1:16:13.520 --> 1:16:16.640
 is I also worked a bit on, oh, we

1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:18.820
 can learn an algorithm with a neural network, right?

1:16:18.820 --> 1:16:20.560
 So you give it many examples, and it's

1:16:20.560 --> 1:16:24.360
 going to sort the input numbers or something like that.

1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:29.520
 But really strong generalization is you give me some numbers

1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:32.320
 or you ask me to create an algorithm that sorts numbers.

1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:34.760
 And instead of creating a neural net, which will be fragile

1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:37.960
 because it's going to go out of range at some point,

1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:40.840
 you're going to give it numbers that are too large, too small,

1:16:40.840 --> 1:16:45.600
 and whatnot, if you just create a piece of code that

1:16:45.600 --> 1:16:47.240
 sorts the numbers, then you can prove

1:16:47.240 --> 1:16:50.600
 that that will generalize to absolutely all the possible

1:16:50.600 --> 1:16:51.960
 input you could give.

1:16:51.960 --> 1:16:55.920
 So I think the problem comes with some exciting prospects.

1:16:55.920 --> 1:16:59.460
 I mean, scale is a bit more boring, but it really works.

1:16:59.460 --> 1:17:02.840
 And then maybe programs and discrete abstractions

1:17:02.840 --> 1:17:04.840
 are a bit less developed.

1:17:04.840 --> 1:17:07.840
 But clearly, I think they're quite exciting in terms

1:17:07.840 --> 1:17:09.960
 of future for the field.

1:17:09.960 --> 1:17:14.040
 Do you draw any insight wisdom from the 80s and expert

1:17:14.040 --> 1:17:16.920
 systems and symbolic systems, symbolic computing?

1:17:16.920 --> 1:17:20.760
 Do you ever go back to those reasoning, that kind of logic?

1:17:20.760 --> 1:17:23.200
 Do you think that might make a comeback?

1:17:23.200 --> 1:17:24.920
 You'll have to dust off those books?

1:17:24.920 --> 1:17:31.320
 Yeah, I actually love actually adding more inductive biases.

1:17:31.320 --> 1:17:34.280
 To me, the problem really is, what are you trying to solve?

1:17:34.280 --> 1:17:37.440
 If what you're trying to solve is so important that try

1:17:37.440 --> 1:17:42.480
 to solve it no matter what, then absolutely use rules,

1:17:42.480 --> 1:17:45.240
 use domain knowledge, and then use

1:17:45.240 --> 1:17:46.920
 a bit of the magic of machine learning

1:17:46.920 --> 1:17:50.640
 to empower to make the system as the best system that

1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:56.040
 will detect cancer or detect weather patterns, right?

1:17:56.040 --> 1:17:59.240
 Or in terms of StarCraft, it also was a very big challenge.

1:17:59.240 --> 1:18:01.920
 So I was definitely happy that if we

1:18:01.920 --> 1:18:04.560
 had to cut a corner here and there,

1:18:04.560 --> 1:18:07.040
 it could have been interesting to do.

1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:09.240
 And in fact, in StarCraft, we start

1:18:09.240 --> 1:18:11.640
 thinking about expert systems because it's a very,

1:18:11.640 --> 1:18:12.800
 you know, you can define.

1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:15.560
 I mean, people actually build StarCraft bots by thinking

1:18:15.560 --> 1:18:20.240
 about those principles, like state machines and rule based.

1:18:20.240 --> 1:18:22.240
 And then you could think of combining

1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:25.560
 a bit of a rule based system, but that has also

1:18:25.560 --> 1:18:28.600
 neural networks incorporated to make it generalize a bit

1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:29.080
 better.

1:18:29.080 --> 1:18:31.480
 So absolutely, I mean, we should definitely

1:18:31.480 --> 1:18:32.840
 go back to those ideas.

1:18:32.840 --> 1:18:35.440
 And anything that makes the problem simpler,

1:18:35.440 --> 1:18:37.960
 as long as your problem is important, that's OK.

1:18:37.960 --> 1:18:41.080
 And that's research driving a very important problem.

1:18:41.080 --> 1:18:44.520
 And on the other hand, if you want to really focus

1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:46.560
 on the limits of reinforcement learning,

1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:50.720
 then of course, you must try not to look at imitation data

1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:55.200
 or to look for some rules of the domain that would help a lot

1:18:55.200 --> 1:18:56.960
 or even feature engineering, right?

1:18:56.960 --> 1:19:00.720
 So this is a tension that depending on what you do,

1:19:00.720 --> 1:19:03.280
 I think both ways are definitely fine.

1:19:03.280 --> 1:19:06.760
 And I would never not do one or the other

1:19:06.760 --> 1:19:08.840
 as long as what you're doing is important

1:19:08.840 --> 1:19:10.000
 and needs to be solved, right?

1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:13.440
 Right, so there's a bunch of different ideas

1:19:13.440 --> 1:19:16.840
 that you developed that I really enjoy.

1:19:16.840 --> 1:19:22.160
 But one is translating from image captioning,

1:19:22.160 --> 1:19:27.480
 translating from image to text, just another beautiful idea,

1:19:27.480 --> 1:19:33.160
 I think, that resonates throughout your work, actually.

1:19:33.160 --> 1:19:35.080
 So the underlying nature of reality

1:19:35.080 --> 1:19:38.760
 being language always, somehow.

1:19:38.760 --> 1:19:42.480
 So what's the connection between images and text,

1:19:42.480 --> 1:19:44.880
 or rather the visual world and the world

1:19:44.880 --> 1:19:46.480
 of language in your view?

1:19:46.480 --> 1:19:51.440
 Right, so I think a piece of research that's been central

1:19:51.440 --> 1:19:54.320
 to, I would say, even extending into StarGraph

1:19:54.320 --> 1:19:57.600
 is this idea of sequence to sequence learning,

1:19:57.600 --> 1:19:59.800
 which what we really meant by that

1:19:59.800 --> 1:20:03.440
 is that you can now really input anything

1:20:03.440 --> 1:20:06.040
 to a neural network as the input x.

1:20:06.040 --> 1:20:09.520
 And then the neural network will learn a function f

1:20:09.520 --> 1:20:12.720
 that will take x as an input and produce any output y.

1:20:12.720 --> 1:20:19.200
 And these x and y's don't need to be static or features,

1:20:19.200 --> 1:20:22.200
 like fixed vectors or anything like that.

1:20:22.200 --> 1:20:26.520
 It could be really sequences and now beyond data structures.

1:20:26.520 --> 1:20:31.560
 So that paradigm was tested in a very interesting way

1:20:31.560 --> 1:20:35.720
 when we moved from translating French to English

1:20:35.720 --> 1:20:37.920
 to translating an image to its caption.

1:20:37.920 --> 1:20:40.720
 But the beauty of it is that, really,

1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:43.000
 and that's actually how it happened.

1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:45.440
 I changed a line of code in this thing that

1:20:45.440 --> 1:20:47.480
 was doing machine translation.

1:20:47.480 --> 1:20:50.080
 And I came the next day, and I saw

1:20:50.080 --> 1:20:54.160
 how it was producing captions that seemed like, oh my god,

1:20:54.160 --> 1:20:55.960
 this is really, really working.

1:20:55.960 --> 1:20:57.640
 And the principle is the same.

1:20:57.640 --> 1:21:04.080
 So I think I don't see text, vision, speech, waveforms

1:21:04.080 --> 1:21:09.000
 as something different as long as you basically

1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:14.760
 learn a function that will vectorize these into.

1:21:14.760 --> 1:21:16.640
 And then after we vectorize it, we

1:21:16.640 --> 1:21:20.040
 can then use transformers, LSTMs, whatever

1:21:20.040 --> 1:21:22.680
 the flavor of the month of the model is.

1:21:22.680 --> 1:21:25.720
 And then as long as we have enough supervised data,

1:21:25.720 --> 1:21:30.040
 really, this formula will work and will keep working,

1:21:30.040 --> 1:21:31.800
 I believe, to some extent.

1:21:31.800 --> 1:21:35.200
 Modulo these generalization issues that I mentioned before.

1:21:35.200 --> 1:21:36.760
 But the task there is to vectorize,

1:21:36.760 --> 1:21:39.840
 so to form a representation that's meaningful.

1:21:39.840 --> 1:21:42.720
 And your intuition now, having worked with all this media,

1:21:42.720 --> 1:21:46.520
 is that once you are able to form that representation,

1:21:46.520 --> 1:21:51.280
 you could basically take any things, any sequence.

1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:52.880
 Going back to StarCraft, is there

1:21:52.880 --> 1:21:56.760
 limits on the length so that we didn't really

1:21:56.760 --> 1:21:59.520
 touch on the long term aspect?

1:21:59.520 --> 1:22:02.480
 How did you overcome the whole really long term

1:22:02.480 --> 1:22:03.800
 aspect of things here?

1:22:03.800 --> 1:22:05.200
 Is there some tricks?

1:22:05.200 --> 1:22:08.680
 So the main trick, so StarCraft, if you

1:22:08.680 --> 1:22:10.880
 look at absolutely every frame, you

1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:12.600
 might think it's quite a long game.

1:22:12.600 --> 1:22:18.400
 So we would have to multiply 22 times 60 seconds per minute

1:22:18.400 --> 1:22:21.840
 times maybe at least 10 minutes per game on average.

1:22:21.840 --> 1:22:25.640
 So there are quite a few frames.

1:22:25.640 --> 1:22:30.200
 But the trick really was to only observe, in fact,

1:22:30.200 --> 1:22:32.280
 which might be seen as a limitation,

1:22:32.280 --> 1:22:35.160
 but it is also a computational advantage.

1:22:35.160 --> 1:22:37.720
 Only observe when you act.

1:22:37.720 --> 1:22:40.000
 And then what the neural network decides

1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:44.680
 is what is the gap going to be until the next action.

1:22:44.680 --> 1:22:48.080
 And if you look at most StarCraft games

1:22:48.080 --> 1:22:51.920
 that we have in the data set that Blizzard provided,

1:22:51.920 --> 1:22:56.000
 it turns out that most games are actually only,

1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.000
 I mean, it is still a long sequence,

1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:02.160
 but it's maybe like 1,000 to 1,500 actions,

1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:07.200
 which if you start looking at LSTMs, large LSTMs,

1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:12.320
 transformers, it's not that difficult, especially

1:23:12.320 --> 1:23:14.320
 if you have supervised learning.

1:23:14.320 --> 1:23:16.240
 If you had to do it with reinforcement learning,

1:23:16.240 --> 1:23:18.080
 the credit assignment problem, what

1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:19.800
 is it in this game that made you win?

1:23:19.800 --> 1:23:21.640
 That would be really difficult.

1:23:21.640 --> 1:23:24.640
 But thankfully, because of imitation learning,

1:23:24.640 --> 1:23:27.400
 we didn't have to deal with these directly.

1:23:27.400 --> 1:23:29.600
 Although if we had to, we tried it.

1:23:29.600 --> 1:23:31.840
 And what happened is you just take all your workers

1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:33.280
 and attack with them.

1:23:33.280 --> 1:23:36.080
 And that is kind of obvious in retrospect

1:23:36.080 --> 1:23:38.120
 because you start trying random actions.

1:23:38.120 --> 1:23:40.280
 One of the actions will be a worker

1:23:40.280 --> 1:23:41.440
 that goes to the enemy base.

1:23:41.440 --> 1:23:43.560
 And because it's self play, it's not

1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:45.680
 going to know how to defend because it basically

1:23:45.680 --> 1:23:47.000
 doesn't know almost anything.

1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:50.320
 And eventually, what you develop is this take all workers

1:23:50.320 --> 1:23:54.680
 and attack because the credit assignment issue in a rally

1:23:54.680 --> 1:23:55.840
 is really, really hard.

1:23:55.840 --> 1:23:57.600
 I do believe we could do better.

1:23:57.600 --> 1:24:01.520
 And that's maybe a research challenge for the future.

1:24:01.520 --> 1:24:04.160
 But yeah, even in StarCraft, the sequences

1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:07.640
 are maybe 1,000, which I believe is

1:24:07.640 --> 1:24:10.360
 within the realm of what transformers can do.

1:24:10.360 --> 1:24:12.800
 Yeah, I guess the difference between StarCraft and Go

1:24:12.800 --> 1:24:18.160
 is in Go and Chess, stuff starts happening right away.

1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:22.240
 So there's not, yeah, it's pretty easy to self play.

1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:24.560
 Not easy, but to self play, it's possible to develop

1:24:24.560 --> 1:24:27.240
 reasonable strategies quickly as opposed to StarCraft.

1:24:27.240 --> 1:24:30.600
 I mean, in Go, there's only 400 actions.

1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:34.200
 But one action is what people would call the God action.

1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:38.480
 That would be if you had expanded the whole search

1:24:38.480 --> 1:24:40.840
 tree, that's the best action if you did minimax

1:24:40.840 --> 1:24:42.800
 or whatever algorithm you would do if you

1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:44.960
 had the computational capacity.

1:24:44.960 --> 1:24:48.720
 But in StarCraft, 400 is minuscule.

1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:51.960
 Like in 400, you couldn't even click

1:24:51.960 --> 1:24:53.840
 on the pixels around a unit.

1:24:53.840 --> 1:24:58.880
 So I think the problem there is in terms of action space size

1:24:58.880 --> 1:25:01.640
 is way harder.

1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:03.960
 And that search is impossible.

1:25:03.960 --> 1:25:06.000
 So there's quite a few challenges indeed

1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:10.640
 that make this kind of a step up in terms of machine learning.

1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:13.560
 For humans, maybe playing StarCraft

1:25:13.560 --> 1:25:16.000
 seems more intuitive because it looks real.

1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.840
 I mean, the graphics and everything moves smoothly,

1:25:18.840 --> 1:25:20.240
 whereas I don't know how to.

1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:22.680
 I mean, Go is a game that I would really need to study.

1:25:22.680 --> 1:25:23.920
 It feels quite complicated.

1:25:23.920 --> 1:25:27.040
 But for machines, kind of maybe it's the reverse, yes.

1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:30.240
 Which shows you the gap actually between deep learning

1:25:30.240 --> 1:25:34.040
 and however the heck our brains work.

1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:36.080
 So you developed a lot of really interesting ideas.

1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:38.480
 It's interesting to just ask, what's

1:25:38.480 --> 1:25:41.200
 your process of developing new ideas?

1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:42.960
 Do you like brainstorming with others?

1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:44.560
 Do you like thinking alone?

1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:49.200
 Do you like, what was it, Ian Goodfellow said

1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:52.840
 he came up with GANs after a few beers.

1:25:52.840 --> 1:25:55.880
 He thinks beers are essential for coming up with new ideas.

1:25:55.880 --> 1:25:59.160
 We had beers to decide to play another game of StarCraft

1:25:59.160 --> 1:25:59.720
 after a week.

1:25:59.720 --> 1:26:02.760
 So it's really similar to that story.

1:26:02.760 --> 1:26:05.880
 Actually, I explained this in a DeepMind retreat.

1:26:05.880 --> 1:26:08.000
 And I said, this is the same as the GAN story.

1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:09.080
 I mean, we were in a bar.

1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:10.920
 And we decided, let's play a GAN next week.

1:26:10.920 --> 1:26:11.880
 And that's what happened.

1:26:11.880 --> 1:26:13.600
 I feel like we're giving the wrong message

1:26:13.600 --> 1:26:15.120
 to young undergrads.

1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:15.760
 Yeah, I know.

1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:18.320
 But in general, do you like brainstorming?

1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:20.280
 Do you like thinking alone, working stuff out?

1:26:20.280 --> 1:26:23.960
 So I think throughout the years, also, things changed.

1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:29.320
 So initially, I was very fortunate to be

1:26:29.320 --> 1:26:33.120
 with great minds like Jeff Hinton, Jeff Dean,

1:26:33.120 --> 1:26:34.040
 Ilya Sutskever.

1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:37.800
 I was really fortunate to join Brain at a very good time.

1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:41.000
 So at that point, ideas, I was just

1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:44.040
 brainstorming with my colleagues and learned a lot.

1:26:44.040 --> 1:26:46.400
 And keep learning is actually something

1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:48.160
 you should never stop doing.

1:26:48.160 --> 1:26:51.520
 So learning implies reading papers and also

1:26:51.520 --> 1:26:53.200
 discussing ideas with others.

1:26:53.200 --> 1:26:56.680
 It's very hard at some point to not communicate

1:26:56.680 --> 1:26:59.160
 that being reading a paper from someone

1:26:59.160 --> 1:27:00.520
 or actually discussing.

1:27:00.520 --> 1:27:04.680
 So definitely, that communication aspect

1:27:04.680 --> 1:27:08.520
 needs to be there, whether it's written or oral.

1:27:08.520 --> 1:27:12.840
 Nowadays, I'm also trying to be a bit more strategic

1:27:12.840 --> 1:27:15.160
 about what research to do.

1:27:15.160 --> 1:27:18.480
 So I was describing a little bit this tension

1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:21.440
 between research for the sake of research,

1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:23.000
 and then you have, on the other hand,

1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:25.520
 applications that can drive the research.

1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:28.560
 And honestly, the formula that has worked best for me

1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:32.240
 is just find a hard problem and then

1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:34.600
 try to see how research fits into it,

1:27:34.600 --> 1:27:37.880
 how it doesn't fit into it, and then you must innovate.

1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:43.040
 So I think machine translation drove sequence to sequence.

1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:47.360
 Then maybe learning algorithms that had to,

1:27:47.360 --> 1:27:50.560
 combinatorial algorithms led to pointer networks.

1:27:50.560 --> 1:27:53.840
 StarCraft led to really scaling up imitation learning

1:27:53.840 --> 1:27:55.520
 and the AlphaStarLeague.

1:27:55.520 --> 1:27:58.360
 So that's been a formula that I personally like.

1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:00.000
 But the other one is also valid.

1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.760
 And I've seen it succeed a lot of the times

1:28:02.760 --> 1:28:05.680
 where you just want to investigate model based

1:28:05.680 --> 1:28:08.160
 RL as a research topic.

1:28:08.160 --> 1:28:11.360
 And then you must then start to think, well,

1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:12.160
 how are the tests?

1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:14.240
 How are you going to test these ideas?

1:28:14.240 --> 1:28:17.920
 You need a minimal environment to try things.

1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:19.720
 You need to read a lot of papers and so on.

1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:21.520
 And that's also very fun to do and something

1:28:21.520 --> 1:28:24.000
 I've also done quite a few times,

1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:28.920
 both at Brain, at DeepMind, and obviously as a PhD.

1:28:28.920 --> 1:28:32.880
 So I think besides the ideas and discussions,

1:28:32.880 --> 1:28:35.920
 I think it's important also because you start

1:28:35.920 --> 1:28:40.200
 sort of guiding not only your own goals,

1:28:40.200 --> 1:28:44.000
 but other people's goals to the next breakthrough.

1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:48.400
 So you must really kind of understand this feasibility

1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:50.400
 also, as we were discussing before,

1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:53.960
 whether this domain is ready to be tackled or not.

1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:55.480
 And you don't want to be too early.

1:28:55.480 --> 1:28:57.080
 You obviously don't want to be too late.

1:28:57.080 --> 1:29:00.520
 So it's really interesting, this strategic component

1:29:00.520 --> 1:29:03.200
 of research, which I think as a grad student,

1:29:03.200 --> 1:29:05.120
 I just had no idea.

1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:07.400
 I just read papers and discussed ideas.

1:29:07.400 --> 1:29:09.760
 And I think this has been maybe the major change.

1:29:09.760 --> 1:29:13.520
 And I recommend people kind of feed forward

1:29:13.520 --> 1:29:16.040
 to success how it looks like and try to backtrack,

1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:18.680
 other than just kind of looking, oh, this looks cool.

1:29:18.680 --> 1:29:19.320
 This looks cool.

1:29:19.320 --> 1:29:21.080
 And then you do a bit of random work,

1:29:21.080 --> 1:29:23.880
 which sometimes you stumble upon some interesting things.

1:29:23.880 --> 1:29:27.440
 But in general, it's also good to plan a bit.

1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:28.960
 Yeah, I like it.

1:29:28.960 --> 1:29:31.960
 Especially like your approach of taking a really hard problem,

1:29:31.960 --> 1:29:33.680
 stepping right in, and then being

1:29:33.680 --> 1:29:37.840
 super skeptical about being able to solve the problem.

1:29:37.840 --> 1:29:40.120
 I mean, there's a balance of both, right?

1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:46.920
 There's a silly optimism and a critical sort of skepticism

1:29:46.920 --> 1:29:49.000
 that's good to balance, which is why

1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:52.400
 it's good to have a team of people that balance that.

1:29:52.400 --> 1:29:53.880
 You don't do that on your own.

1:29:53.880 --> 1:29:56.440
 You have both mentors that have seen,

1:29:56.440 --> 1:29:59.680
 or you obviously want to chat and discuss

1:29:59.680 --> 1:30:00.920
 whether it's the right time.

1:30:00.920 --> 1:30:03.960
 I mean, Demis came in 2014.

1:30:03.960 --> 1:30:06.600
 And he said, maybe in a bit we'll do StarCraft.

1:30:06.600 --> 1:30:08.240
 And maybe he knew.

1:30:08.240 --> 1:30:11.200
 And I'm just following his lead, which is great,

1:30:11.200 --> 1:30:12.600
 because he's brilliant, right?

1:30:12.600 --> 1:30:17.280
 So these things are obviously quite important,

1:30:17.280 --> 1:30:22.280
 that you want to be surrounded by people who are diverse.

1:30:22.280 --> 1:30:23.960
 They have their knowledge.

1:30:23.960 --> 1:30:26.640
 There's also important to, I mean,

1:30:26.640 --> 1:30:30.960
 I've learned a lot from people who actually have an idea

1:30:30.960 --> 1:30:32.440
 that I might not think it's good.

1:30:32.440 --> 1:30:34.880
 But if I give them the space to try it,

1:30:34.880 --> 1:30:37.080
 I've been proven wrong many, many times as well.

1:30:37.080 --> 1:30:38.200
 So that's great.

1:30:38.200 --> 1:30:42.760
 I think your colleagues are more important than yourself,

1:30:42.760 --> 1:30:43.480
 I think.

1:30:43.480 --> 1:30:44.480
 Sure.

1:30:44.480 --> 1:30:48.600
 Now let's real quick talk about another impossible problem,

1:30:48.600 --> 1:30:49.560
 AGI.

1:30:49.560 --> 1:30:50.280
 Right.

1:30:50.280 --> 1:30:52.680
 What do you think it takes to build a system that's

1:30:52.680 --> 1:30:54.080
 human level intelligence?

1:30:54.080 --> 1:30:56.400
 We talked a little bit about the Turing test, StarCraft.

1:30:56.400 --> 1:30:58.960
 All of these have echoes of general intelligence.

1:30:58.960 --> 1:31:01.400
 But if you think about just something

1:31:01.400 --> 1:31:03.400
 that you would sit back and say, wow,

1:31:03.400 --> 1:31:06.720
 this is really something that resembles

1:31:06.720 --> 1:31:07.800
 human level intelligence.

1:31:07.800 --> 1:31:09.520
 What do you think it takes to build that?

1:31:09.520 --> 1:31:17.160
 So I find that AGI oftentimes is maybe not very well defined.

1:31:17.160 --> 1:31:20.520
 So what I'm trying to then come up with for myself

1:31:20.520 --> 1:31:25.040
 is what would be a result look like that you would start

1:31:25.040 --> 1:31:28.640
 to believe that you would have agents or neural nets that

1:31:28.640 --> 1:31:31.800
 no longer overfeed to a single task,

1:31:31.800 --> 1:31:37.840
 but actually learn the skill of learning, so to speak.

1:31:37.840 --> 1:31:40.480
 And that actually is a field that I

1:31:40.480 --> 1:31:43.560
 am fascinated by, which is the learning to learn,

1:31:43.560 --> 1:31:47.120
 or meta learning, which is about no longer learning

1:31:47.120 --> 1:31:48.680
 about a single domain.

1:31:48.680 --> 1:31:51.040
 So you can think about the learning algorithm

1:31:51.040 --> 1:31:52.680
 itself is general.

1:31:52.680 --> 1:31:56.800
 So the same formula we applied for AlphaStar or StarCraft,

1:31:56.800 --> 1:31:59.440
 we can now apply to almost any video game,

1:31:59.440 --> 1:32:03.520
 or you could apply to many other problems and domains.

1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:07.040
 But the algorithm is what's generalizing.

1:32:07.040 --> 1:32:09.640
 But the neural network, those weights

1:32:09.640 --> 1:32:12.120
 are useless even to play another race.

1:32:12.120 --> 1:32:15.400
 I train a network to play very well at Protos versus Protos.

1:32:15.400 --> 1:32:17.680
 I need to throw away those weights.

1:32:17.680 --> 1:32:20.640
 If I want to play now Terran versus Terran,

1:32:20.640 --> 1:32:23.720
 I would need to retrain a network from scratch

1:32:23.720 --> 1:32:24.800
 with the same algorithm.

1:32:24.800 --> 1:32:26.000
 That's beautiful.

1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:28.640
 But the network itself will not be useful.

1:32:28.640 --> 1:32:32.840
 So I think if I see an approach that

1:32:32.840 --> 1:32:38.040
 can absorb or start solving new problems without the need

1:32:38.040 --> 1:32:40.280
 to kind of restart the process, I

1:32:40.280 --> 1:32:42.600
 think that, to me, would be a nice way

1:32:42.600 --> 1:32:45.600
 to define some form of AGI.

1:32:45.600 --> 1:32:48.120
 Again, I don't know the grandiose like age.

1:32:48.120 --> 1:32:50.600
 I mean, should Turing tests be solved before AGI?

1:32:50.600 --> 1:32:51.720
 I mean, I don't know.

1:32:51.720 --> 1:32:54.760
 I think concretely, I would like to see clearly

1:32:54.760 --> 1:32:57.560
 that meta learning happen, meaning

1:32:57.560 --> 1:33:01.320
 that there is an architecture or a network that

1:33:01.320 --> 1:33:04.920
 as it sees new problem or new data, it solves it.

1:33:04.920 --> 1:33:08.240
 And to make it kind of a benchmark,

1:33:08.240 --> 1:33:09.800
 it should solve it at the same speed

1:33:09.800 --> 1:33:11.400
 that we do solve new problems.

1:33:11.400 --> 1:33:13.520
 When I define you a new object and you

1:33:13.520 --> 1:33:16.240
 have to recognize it, when you start playing a new game,

1:33:16.240 --> 1:33:17.480
 you played all the Atari games.

1:33:17.480 --> 1:33:19.360
 But now you play a new Atari game.

1:33:19.360 --> 1:33:22.000
 Well, you're going to be pretty quickly pretty good

1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:22.560
 at the game.

1:33:22.560 --> 1:33:25.840
 So that's perhaps what's the domain

1:33:25.840 --> 1:33:28.120
 and what's the exact benchmark is a bit difficult.

1:33:28.120 --> 1:33:29.760
 I think as a community, we might need

1:33:29.760 --> 1:33:32.600
 to do some work to define it.

1:33:32.600 --> 1:33:34.720
 But I think this first step, I could

1:33:34.720 --> 1:33:36.840
 see it happen relatively soon.

1:33:36.840 --> 1:33:40.600
 But then the whole what AGI means and so on,

1:33:40.600 --> 1:33:43.120
 I am a bit more confused about what

1:33:43.120 --> 1:33:44.800
 I think people mean different things.

1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:48.680
 There's an emotional, psychological level

1:33:48.680 --> 1:33:53.080
 that like even the Turing test, passing the Turing test

1:33:53.080 --> 1:33:55.840
 is something that we just pass judgment on as human beings

1:33:55.840 --> 1:34:03.560
 what it means to be as a dog in AGI system.

1:34:03.560 --> 1:34:04.080
 Yeah.

1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:07.520
 What level, what does it mean, what does it mean?

1:34:07.520 --> 1:34:08.960
 But I like the generalization.

1:34:08.960 --> 1:34:10.680
 And maybe as a community, we converge

1:34:10.680 --> 1:34:14.960
 towards a group of domains that are sufficiently far away.

1:34:14.960 --> 1:34:16.560
 That would be really damn impressive

1:34:16.560 --> 1:34:18.280
 if it was able to generalize.

1:34:18.280 --> 1:34:21.360
 So perhaps not as close as Protoss and Zerg,

1:34:21.360 --> 1:34:22.720
 but like Wikipedia.

1:34:22.720 --> 1:34:23.600
 That would be a step.

1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:26.400
 Yeah, that would be a good step and then a really good step.

1:34:26.400 --> 1:34:30.800
 But then like from StarCraft to Wikipedia and back.

1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:31.880
 Yeah, that kind of thing.

1:34:31.880 --> 1:34:34.200
 And that feels also quite hard and far.

1:34:34.200 --> 1:34:38.200
 But I think as long as you put the benchmark out,

1:34:38.200 --> 1:34:41.080
 as we discovered, for instance, with ImageNet,

1:34:41.080 --> 1:34:43.120
 then tremendous progress can be had.

1:34:43.120 --> 1:34:46.360
 So I think maybe there's a lack of benchmark,

1:34:46.360 --> 1:34:49.520
 but I'm sure we'll find one and the community will then

1:34:49.520 --> 1:34:52.360
 work towards that.

1:34:52.360 --> 1:34:56.920
 And then beyond what AGI might mean or would imply,

1:34:56.920 --> 1:35:01.040
 I really am hopeful to see basically machine learning

1:35:01.040 --> 1:35:05.280
 or AI just scaling up and helping people

1:35:05.280 --> 1:35:08.640
 that might not have the resources to hire an assistant

1:35:08.640 --> 1:35:13.800
 or that they might not even know what the weather is like.

1:35:13.800 --> 1:35:18.000
 So I think in terms of the positive impact of AI,

1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:22.440
 I think that's maybe what we should also not lose focus.

1:35:22.440 --> 1:35:23.960
 The research community building AGI,

1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:25.520
 I mean, that's a real nice goal.

1:35:25.520 --> 1:35:28.480
 But I think the way that DeepMind puts it is,

1:35:28.480 --> 1:35:30.760
 and then use it to solve everything else.

1:35:30.760 --> 1:35:33.440
 So I think we should paralyze.

1:35:33.440 --> 1:35:36.160
 Yeah, we shouldn't forget about all the positive things

1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:38.000
 that are actually coming out of AI already

1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.600
 and are going to be coming out.

1:35:40.600 --> 1:35:41.600
 Right.

1:35:41.600 --> 1:35:45.400
 But on that note, let me ask relative

1:35:45.400 --> 1:35:47.760
 to popular perception, do you have

1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:49.640
 any worry about the existential threat

1:35:49.640 --> 1:35:53.200
 of artificial intelligence in the near or far future

1:35:53.200 --> 1:35:55.080
 that some people have?

1:35:55.080 --> 1:35:58.080
 I think in the near future, I'm skeptical.

1:35:58.080 --> 1:35:59.280
 So I hope I'm not wrong.

1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:04.720
 But I'm not concerned, but I appreciate efforts,

1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:07.760
 ongoing efforts, and even like whole research

1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:10.720
 field on AI safety emerging and in conferences and so on.

1:36:10.720 --> 1:36:12.560
 I think that's great.

1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:16.200
 In the long term, I really hope we just

1:36:16.200 --> 1:36:19.120
 can simply have the benefits outweigh

1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:20.600
 the potential dangers.

1:36:20.600 --> 1:36:23.400
 I am hopeful for that.

1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:27.400
 But also, we must remain vigilant to monitor and assess

1:36:27.400 --> 1:36:32.640
 whether the tradeoffs are there and we have enough also lead

1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:37.720
 time to prevent or to redirect our efforts if need be.

1:36:37.720 --> 1:36:41.440
 But I'm quite optimistic about the technology

1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:45.000
 and definitely more fearful of other threats

1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:48.600
 in terms of planetary level at this point.

1:36:48.600 --> 1:36:52.520
 But obviously, that's the one I have more power on.

1:36:52.520 --> 1:36:56.280
 So clearly, I do start thinking more and more about this.

1:36:56.280 --> 1:37:00.840
 And it's grown in me actually to start reading more

1:37:00.840 --> 1:37:04.120
 about AI safety, which is a field that so far I have not

1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:05.360
 really contributed to.

1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:07.720
 But maybe there's something to be done there as well.

1:37:07.720 --> 1:37:09.280
 I think it's really important.

1:37:09.280 --> 1:37:11.440
 I talk about this with a few folks.

1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:14.800
 But it's important to ask you and shove it in your head

1:37:14.800 --> 1:37:18.040
 because you're at the leading edge of actually what

1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:19.880
 people are excited about in AI.

1:37:19.880 --> 1:37:22.800
 The work with AlphaStar, it's arguably

1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:25.400
 at the very cutting edge of the kind of thing

1:37:25.400 --> 1:37:27.160
 that people are afraid of.

1:37:27.160 --> 1:37:31.640
 And so you speaking to that fact and that we're actually

1:37:31.640 --> 1:37:33.520
 quite far away to the kind of thing

1:37:33.520 --> 1:37:35.160
 that people might be afraid of.

1:37:35.160 --> 1:37:38.320
 But it's still worthwhile to think about.

1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:43.480
 And it's also good that you're not as worried

1:37:43.480 --> 1:37:45.720
 and you're also open to thinking about it.

1:37:45.720 --> 1:37:46.560
 There's two aspects.

1:37:46.560 --> 1:37:47.720
 I mean, me not being worried.

1:37:47.720 --> 1:37:53.880
 But obviously, we should prepare for things

1:37:53.880 --> 1:37:56.800
 that could go wrong, misuse of the technologies

1:37:56.800 --> 1:37:58.360
 as with any technologies.

1:37:58.360 --> 1:38:02.400
 So I think there's always trade offs.

1:38:02.400 --> 1:38:06.800
 And as a society, we've kind of solved this to some extent

1:38:06.800 --> 1:38:07.360
 in the past.

1:38:07.360 --> 1:38:10.720
 So I'm hoping that by having the researchers

1:38:10.720 --> 1:38:14.120
 and the whole community brainstorm and come up

1:38:14.120 --> 1:38:16.960
 with interesting solutions to the new things that

1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:20.320
 will happen in the future, that we can still also push

1:38:20.320 --> 1:38:23.000
 the research to the avenue that I think

1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:25.800
 is kind of the greatest avenue, which is

1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:27.760
 to understand intelligence.

1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:29.920
 How are we doing what we're doing?

1:38:29.920 --> 1:38:32.560
 And obviously, from a scientific standpoint,

1:38:32.560 --> 1:38:37.000
 that is kind of my personal drive of all the time

1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:40.000
 that I spend doing what I'm doing, really.

1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:42.960
 Where do you see the deep learning as a field heading?

1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:46.720
 Where do you think the next big breakthrough might be?

1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:49.880
 So I think deep learning, I discussed a little of this

1:38:49.880 --> 1:38:50.720
 before.

1:38:50.720 --> 1:38:54.000
 Deep learning has to be combined with some form

1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:56.680
 of discretization, program synthesis.

1:38:56.680 --> 1:38:59.240
 I think that's kind of as a research in itself

1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:02.000
 is an interesting topic to expand and start

1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:04.080
 doing more research.

1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:07.080
 And then as kind of what will deep learning

1:39:07.080 --> 1:39:08.560
 enable to do in the future?

1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:11.480
 I don't think that's going to be what's going to happen this year.

1:39:11.480 --> 1:39:16.480
 But also this idea of starting not to throw away all the weights,

1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:18.840
 that this idea of learning to learn

1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:23.400
 and really having these agents not having

1:39:23.400 --> 1:39:24.960
 to restart their weights.

1:39:24.960 --> 1:39:29.760
 And you can have an agent that is kind of solving or classifying

1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:32.760
 images on ImageNet, but also generating speech

1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:34.680
 if you ask it to generate some speech.

1:39:34.680 --> 1:39:39.760
 And it should really be kind of almost the same network,

1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:41.760
 but it might not be a neural network.

1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:44.240
 It might be a neural network with an optimization

1:39:44.240 --> 1:39:45.600
 algorithm attached to it.

1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:49.280
 But I think this idea of generalization to new task

1:39:49.280 --> 1:39:52.160
 is something that we first must define good benchmarks.

1:39:52.160 --> 1:39:54.680
 But then I think that's going to be exciting.

1:39:54.680 --> 1:39:56.480
 And I'm not sure how close we are.

1:39:56.480 --> 1:40:00.880
 But I think if you have a very limited domain,

1:40:00.880 --> 1:40:02.800
 I think we can start doing some progress.

1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:07.200
 And much like how we did a lot of programs in computer vision,

1:40:07.200 --> 1:40:09.040
 we should start thinking.

1:40:09.040 --> 1:40:12.720
 I really like a talk that Leon Buto gave at ICML

1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:16.800
 a few years ago, which is this train test paradigm should

1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:17.920
 be broken.

1:40:17.920 --> 1:40:23.160
 We should stop thinking about a training set and a test set.

1:40:23.160 --> 1:40:26.640
 And these are closed things that are untouchable.

1:40:26.640 --> 1:40:28.200
 I think we should go beyond these.

1:40:28.200 --> 1:40:30.840
 And in meta learning, we call these the meta training

1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:35.320
 set and the meta test set, which is really thinking about,

1:40:35.320 --> 1:40:39.040
 if I know about ImageNet, why would that network not

1:40:39.040 --> 1:40:41.320
 work on MNIST, which is a much simpler problem?

1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:44.560
 But right now, it really doesn't.

1:40:44.560 --> 1:40:46.200
 But it just feels wrong.

1:40:46.200 --> 1:40:50.960
 So I think that's kind of the, on the application

1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:52.960
 or the benchmark sites, we probably

1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:56.520
 will see quite a few more interest and progress

1:40:56.520 --> 1:41:00.240
 and hopefully people defining new and exciting challenges

1:41:00.240 --> 1:41:00.960
 really.

1:41:00.960 --> 1:41:04.160
 Do you have any hope or interest in knowledge graphs

1:41:04.160 --> 1:41:05.280
 within this context?

1:41:05.280 --> 1:41:08.160
 So this kind of constructing graph.

1:41:08.160 --> 1:41:10.480
 So going back to graphs.

1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:12.120
 Well, neural networks and graphs.

1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:14.840
 But I mean, a different kind of knowledge graph,

1:41:14.840 --> 1:41:18.000
 sort of like semantic graphs or those concepts.

1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:18.800
 Yeah.

1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:23.520
 So I think the idea of graphs is,

1:41:23.520 --> 1:41:26.680
 so I've been quite interested in sequences first and then

1:41:26.680 --> 1:41:29.720
 more interesting or different data structures like graphs.

1:41:29.720 --> 1:41:33.960
 And I've studied graph neural networks in the last three

1:41:33.960 --> 1:41:34.520
 years or so.

1:41:34.520 --> 1:41:37.680
 I found these models just very interesting

1:41:37.680 --> 1:41:42.160
 from deep learning sites standpoint.

1:41:42.160 --> 1:41:45.840
 But then why do we want these models

1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:47.280
 and why would we use them?

1:41:47.280 --> 1:41:48.640
 What's the application?

1:41:48.640 --> 1:41:51.320
 What's kind of the killer application of graphs?

1:41:51.320 --> 1:41:58.520
 And perhaps if we could extract a knowledge graph

1:41:58.520 --> 1:42:01.680
 from Wikipedia automatically, that

1:42:01.680 --> 1:42:04.680
 would be interesting because then these graphs have

1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:07.920
 this very interesting structure that also is a bit more

1:42:07.920 --> 1:42:11.560
 compatible with this idea of programs and deep learning

1:42:11.560 --> 1:42:14.360
 kind of working together, jumping neighborhoods

1:42:14.360 --> 1:42:14.840
 and so on.

1:42:14.840 --> 1:42:17.080
 You could imagine defining some primitives

1:42:17.080 --> 1:42:18.800
 to go around graphs, right?

1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:23.720
 So I think I really like the idea of a knowledge graph.

1:42:23.720 --> 1:42:29.640
 And in fact, when we started or as part of the research

1:42:29.640 --> 1:42:31.960
 we did for StarCraft, I thought, wouldn't it

1:42:31.960 --> 1:42:38.000
 be cool to give the graph of all these buildings that

1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:41.440
 depend on each other and units that have prerequisites

1:42:41.440 --> 1:42:42.440
 of being built by that.

1:42:42.440 --> 1:42:45.680
 And so this is information that the network

1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:46.920
 can learn and extract.

1:42:46.920 --> 1:42:50.120
 But it would have been great to see

1:42:50.120 --> 1:42:53.880
 or to think of really StarCraft as a giant graph that even

1:42:53.880 --> 1:42:57.040
 also as the game evolves, you start taking branches

1:42:57.040 --> 1:42:57.960
 and so on.

1:42:57.960 --> 1:42:59.920
 And we did a bit of research on these,

1:42:59.920 --> 1:43:04.080
 nothing too relevant, but I really like the idea.

1:43:04.080 --> 1:43:06.360
 And it has elements that are something

1:43:06.360 --> 1:43:08.840
 you also worked with in terms of visualizing your networks.

1:43:08.840 --> 1:43:13.280
 It has elements of having human interpretable,

1:43:13.280 --> 1:43:15.840
 being able to generate knowledge representations that

1:43:15.840 --> 1:43:18.640
 are human interpretable that maybe human experts can then

1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:20.960
 tweak or at least understand.

1:43:20.960 --> 1:43:22.880
 So there's a lot of interesting aspect there.

1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:25.600
 And for me personally, I'm just a huge fan of Wikipedia.

1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:29.360
 And it's a shame that our neural networks aren't

1:43:29.360 --> 1:43:31.600
 taking advantage of all the structured knowledge that's

1:43:31.600 --> 1:43:32.400
 on the web.

1:43:32.400 --> 1:43:34.920
 What's next for you?

1:43:34.920 --> 1:43:36.400
 What's next for DeepMind?

1:43:36.400 --> 1:43:39.680
 What are you excited about for AlphaStar?

1:43:39.680 --> 1:43:43.560
 Yeah, so I think the obvious next steps

1:43:43.560 --> 1:43:48.040
 would be to apply AlphaStar to other races.

1:43:48.040 --> 1:43:51.640
 I mean, that sort of shows that the algorithm works

1:43:51.640 --> 1:43:56.120
 because we wouldn't want to have created by mistake something

1:43:56.120 --> 1:43:58.840
 in the architecture that happens to work for Protoss

1:43:58.840 --> 1:44:00.120
 but not for other races.

1:44:00.120 --> 1:44:03.480
 So as verification, I think that's an obvious next step

1:44:03.480 --> 1:44:05.640
 that we are working on.

1:44:05.640 --> 1:44:11.440
 And then I would like to see so agents and players can

1:44:11.440 --> 1:44:13.920
 specialize on different skill sets that

1:44:13.920 --> 1:44:15.920
 allow them to be very good.

1:44:15.920 --> 1:44:19.480
 I think we've seen AlphaStar understanding very well

1:44:19.480 --> 1:44:22.360
 when to take battles and when to not to do that.

1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:24.880
 Also very good at micromanagement

1:44:24.880 --> 1:44:27.520
 and moving the units around and so on.

1:44:27.520 --> 1:44:30.400
 And also very good at producing nonstop and trading off

1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:33.360
 economy with building units.

1:44:33.360 --> 1:44:36.520
 But I have not perhaps seen as much

1:44:36.520 --> 1:44:39.000
 as I would like this idea of the poker idea

1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:40.360
 that you mentioned, right?

1:44:40.360 --> 1:44:42.600
 I'm not sure StarCraft or AlphaStar

1:44:42.600 --> 1:44:47.160
 rather has developed a very deep understanding of what

1:44:47.160 --> 1:44:50.120
 the opponent is doing and reacting to that

1:44:50.120 --> 1:44:54.080
 and sort of trying to trick the player to do something else

1:44:54.080 --> 1:44:55.440
 or that.

1:44:55.440 --> 1:44:58.320
 So this kind of reasoning, I would like to see more.

1:44:58.320 --> 1:45:01.600
 So I think purely from a research standpoint,

1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:03.920
 there's perhaps also quite a few things

1:45:03.920 --> 1:45:06.000
 to be done there in the domain of StarCraft.

1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.320
 Yeah, in the domain of games, I've

1:45:08.320 --> 1:45:11.960
 seen some interesting work in even auctions,

1:45:11.960 --> 1:45:15.160
 manipulating other players, sort of forming a belief state

1:45:15.160 --> 1:45:17.160
 and just messing with people.

1:45:17.160 --> 1:45:18.800
 Yeah, it's called theory of mind, I guess.

1:45:18.800 --> 1:45:20.080
 Theory of mind, yeah.

1:45:20.080 --> 1:45:21.440
 So it's a fascinating.

1:45:21.440 --> 1:45:24.400
 Theory of mind on StarCraft is kind of they're

1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:26.080
 really made for each other.

1:45:26.080 --> 1:45:29.840
 So that would be very exciting to see those techniques apply

1:45:29.840 --> 1:45:32.040
 to StarCraft or perhaps StarCraft

1:45:32.040 --> 1:45:33.280
 driving new techniques, right?

1:45:33.280 --> 1:45:36.600
 As I said, this is always the tension between the two.

1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:38.800
 Well, Orel, thank you so much for talking today.

1:45:38.800 --> 1:45:39.320
 Awesome.

1:45:39.320 --> 1:45:40.280
 It was great to be here.

1:45:40.280 --> 1:46:00.600
 Thanks.
