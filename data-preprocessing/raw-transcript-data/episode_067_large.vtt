00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
 The following is a conversation with Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize winner in economics,

00:04.880 --> 00:10.560
 professor at CUNY, and columnist at the New York Times. His academic work centers around

00:10.560 --> 00:16.880
 international economics, economic geography, liquidity traps, and currency crises. But he

00:16.880 --> 00:22.400
 also is an outspoken writer and commentator on the intersection of modern day politics

00:22.400 --> 00:30.080
 and economics, which places him in the middle of the tense, divisive, modern day political discourse.

00:30.080 --> 00:34.560
 If you have clicked dislike on this video and started writing a comment of derision before

00:34.560 --> 00:39.840
 listening to the conversation, I humbly ask that you please unsubscribe from this channel

00:39.840 --> 00:44.560
 and from this podcast. Not because you're conservative, a libertarian, a liberal,

00:44.560 --> 00:49.680
 a socialist, an anarchist, but because you're not open to new ideas, at least in this case,

00:49.680 --> 00:54.480
 especially at its most difficult, from people with whom you largely disagree.

00:55.520 --> 01:00.720
 I do my best to stay away from politics of the day because political discourse is filled

01:00.720 --> 01:07.120
 with a degree of emotion and self assured certainty that to me is not conducive to exploring

01:07.120 --> 01:13.440
 questions that nobody knows the definitive right answer to. The role of government,

01:13.440 --> 01:19.840
 the impact of automation, the regulation of tech, the medical system, guns, war, trade,

01:19.840 --> 01:26.480
 foreign policy, are not easy topics and have no clear answers, despite the certainty of the so

01:26.480 --> 01:32.640
 called experts, the pundits, the trolls, the media personalities, and the conspiracy theorists.

01:33.520 --> 01:40.960
 Please listen, empathize, and allow yourself to explore ideas with curiosity and without judgment

01:40.960 --> 01:47.440
 and without derision. I will speak with many more economists and political thinkers, trying to stay

01:47.440 --> 01:52.400
 away from the political battles of the day and instead look at the long arc of history

01:52.400 --> 02:11.440
 and the lessons it reveals. In this, I appreciate your patience and support.

02:30.400 --> 02:35.120
 This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.

02:35.120 --> 02:40.080
 Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with

02:40.080 --> 02:45.280
 fractional share trading, allowing you to buy one dollars worth of a stock no matter what the stock

02:45.280 --> 02:52.320
 price is. Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing, a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.

02:52.960 --> 02:59.760
 Get Cash App from the App Store and Google Play and use the code LEXPODCAST. You'll get ten dollars

02:59.760 --> 03:04.960
 and Cash App will also donate ten dollars to FIRST, one of my favorite organizations that is helping

03:04.960 --> 03:11.520
 to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world. Since Cash App does

03:11.520 --> 03:17.840
 fractional share trading, let me say that to me, it's a fascinating concept. The order execution

03:17.840 --> 03:22.880
 algorithm that works behind the scenes to create the abstraction of fractional orders for the

03:22.880 --> 03:29.360
 investor is an algorithmic marvel, so big props to the Cash App engineers for that. I like it when

03:29.360 --> 03:34.960
 tech teams solve complicated problems to provide, in the end, a simple, effortless interface that

03:34.960 --> 03:41.440
 abstracts away all the details of the underlying algorithm. And now, here's my conversation with

03:41.440 --> 03:48.160
 Paul Krugman. What does a perfect world, a utopia, from an economics perspective look like?

03:50.000 --> 03:56.400
 Wow, I don't really, I don't believe in perfection. I mean, somebody once once said

03:56.400 --> 04:06.400
 that his ideal was slightly imaginary Sweden. I mean, I like an economy that has a really high

04:06.400 --> 04:14.720
 safety net for people, good environmental regulation, and something that's kind of like

04:16.080 --> 04:22.240
 some of the better run countries in the world, but with fixing all of the smaller things that

04:22.240 --> 04:27.040
 are wrong with them. What about wealth distribution? Well, obviously, you know, total equality is

04:28.720 --> 04:32.560
 neither possible nor, I think, especially desirable, but I think you want one where,

04:33.360 --> 04:41.120
 basically one where nobody is hurting and where everybody lives in the same material universe.

04:41.120 --> 04:47.040
 Everybody is basically living in the same society, so I think it's a bad thing to have

04:47.040 --> 04:50.240
 people who are so wealthy that they're really not in the same world as the rest of us.

04:50.240 --> 04:57.200
 What about competition? Do you see the value of competition? What may be its limits?

04:57.200 --> 05:04.000
 Oh, competition is great when it can work. I mean, I remember, I'm old enough to remember

05:04.000 --> 05:09.920
 when there was only one phone company and there was really limited choice, and I think the

05:09.920 --> 05:17.760
 arrival of multiple phone carriers and all that has actually, you know, it's been a really good

05:17.760 --> 05:25.680
 thing, and that's true across many areas, but not every industry is, not every activity is suitable

05:25.680 --> 05:30.400
 for competition. So, there are some things like healthcare where competition actually

05:30.400 --> 05:35.760
 doesn't work, and so it's not one size fits all.

05:35.760 --> 05:41.520
 That's interesting. Why does competition not work in healthcare?

05:41.520 --> 05:46.320
 Oh, there's a long list. I mean, there's a famous paper by Kenneth Arrow from 1963,

05:46.320 --> 05:50.160
 which still holds up very well, where he kind of runs down the list of things you need for

05:50.160 --> 05:55.680
 competition to work well. Basically, both sides to every transaction being well informed,

05:56.480 --> 06:02.880
 having the ability to make intelligent decisions, understanding what's going on,

06:02.880 --> 06:05.600
 and healthcare fails on every dimension.

06:06.560 --> 06:08.480
 Healthcare, so not health insurance, healthcare.

06:08.480 --> 06:12.240
 Well, both healthcare and health insurance, health insurance being part of it, but no,

06:12.240 --> 06:18.800
 health insurance is really the idea that there's effective competition between health insurers is

06:18.800 --> 06:25.280
 wrong, and healthcare, I mean, the idea that you can comparison shop for major surgery is just,

06:25.280 --> 06:32.160
 you know, when people say things like that, you wonder, are you living in the same world I'm

06:32.160 --> 06:33.520
 living in?

06:33.520 --> 06:38.160
 You know, that piece of well informed, that was always an interesting piece for me,

06:38.160 --> 06:44.880
 just observing as an outsider, because so much beautiful, such a beautiful world is

06:44.880 --> 06:49.440
 possible when everybody's well informed. My question for you is, how hard is it to be

06:49.440 --> 06:54.560
 well informed about anything, whether it's healthcare, or any kind of purchasing decisions,

06:54.560 --> 06:56.880
 or just life in general in this world?

06:57.520 --> 07:03.760
 Oh, information, you know, it varies hugely. I mean, there's more information at your

07:03.760 --> 07:10.880
 fingertips than ever before in history. The trouble is, first of all, that some of that

07:10.880 --> 07:18.000
 information isn't true. So it's really hard. And then some of it is just too hard to understand.

07:18.000 --> 07:24.960
 So if I'm buying a car, I can actually probably do a pretty good job of looking up, you know,

07:24.960 --> 07:28.960
 going to consumer reports, reviews, you can get a pretty good idea of what you're getting

07:28.960 --> 07:38.480
 when you get a car. If I'm going in for surgery, first of all, you know, fairly often it happens

07:39.120 --> 07:44.880
 without your being able to plan it. But also, there's a, you know, medical school takes

07:44.880 --> 07:49.760
 many, many years, and going on the internet for some advice is not usually a very good

07:50.560 --> 07:51.060
 substitute.

07:52.400 --> 07:57.440
 So speaking about news and not being able to trust certain sources of information,

07:57.440 --> 08:02.800
 how much disagreement is there about, I mentioned utopia, perfection in the beginning, but how much

08:02.800 --> 08:09.440
 disagreement is there about what utopia looks like? Or is most of the disagreement simply about the

08:09.440 --> 08:10.400
 path to get there?

08:11.760 --> 08:20.320
 Oh, I think there's two levels of disagreement. One, maybe not utopia, but justice. You know,

08:20.320 --> 08:25.760
 what is a just society? And that's, there are different views. I mean, I teach my students

08:25.760 --> 08:32.480
 that there are, you know, broadly speaking, two views of justice. One focuses on outcomes.

08:34.880 --> 08:39.920
 You ask yourself, a just society is the one you would choose if you were trying to,

08:41.520 --> 08:45.840
 the one that you would choose to live in if you didn't know who you were going to be,

08:45.840 --> 08:52.320
 that's kind of John Rawls. And the other focuses on process, that a just society is one in which

08:52.320 --> 09:00.320
 there is no coercion except where absolutely necessary. And there's no objective way to choose

09:00.320 --> 09:06.240
 between those. I'm pretty much a Rawlsian, and I think many people are. But anyway, so there's a

09:06.240 --> 09:13.280
 legitimate dispute about what we mean by a just society anyway. But then there's also a lot of

09:13.280 --> 09:22.800
 a lot of dispute about what actually works. There's a range of legitimate dispute. I mean, any

09:22.800 --> 09:28.560
 card carrying economist will say that incentives matter, but how much do they matter? How much does

09:28.560 --> 09:34.720
 a higher tax rate actually deter people from working? How much does a stronger safety net

09:34.720 --> 09:46.000
 actually lead people to get lazy? I have a pretty strong view that the evidence points to conclusions

09:46.000 --> 09:53.280
 that are considerably to the left of where most of our politicians are. But there is legitimate

09:53.280 --> 10:01.440
 room for disagreement on those things. So you've mentioned outcomes. What are some metrics you

10:01.440 --> 10:06.400
 think about that you keep in mind, like the Gini coefficient, but really anything that measures

10:07.200 --> 10:12.000
 how good we're doing, whatever we're trying to do? What are the metrics you keep an eye on?

10:12.560 --> 10:17.840
 Well, I'm actually I'm not a fan of the Gini coefficient, not because what is the Gini

10:17.840 --> 10:23.600
 coefficient? Yeah, the Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality, and it is commonly used

10:23.600 --> 10:29.600
 because it's a single number. It usually tracks with other measures, but the trouble is there's

10:29.600 --> 10:40.400
 no sort of natural interpretation of it. If you ask me what does a society with a Gini of 0.45

10:40.400 --> 10:46.720
 look like as opposed to a society with a Gini of 0.25? And I can kind of tell you, you know,

10:46.720 --> 10:56.000
 when 0.25 is Denmark and 0.45 is Brazil, but there's no sort of easy way to do that mapping.

10:56.000 --> 11:03.120
 I mean, I look at things like what is, first of all, things like what is the income of the

11:04.880 --> 11:12.160
 median family? What is the income of the top 1%? How many people are in poverty by

11:12.720 --> 11:18.720
 various measures of poverty? And then I think you want to look at questions like

11:18.720 --> 11:30.080
 how healthy are people? How is life expectancy doing? And how satisfied are people with their

11:30.080 --> 11:35.200
 lives? Because there is that sounds like a squishy number, not so much happiness. It

11:35.200 --> 11:40.160
 turns out that life satisfaction is a better measure than happiness. But life satisfaction,

11:40.160 --> 11:49.120
 that varies quite a lot. And I think it's meaningful, if not too rigorous to say, look,

11:49.120 --> 11:55.600
 according to polling, people in Denmark are pretty satisfied with their lives and

11:56.560 --> 12:01.840
 people in the United States, not so much so. And of course, Sweden wins every time.

12:01.840 --> 12:06.720
 No, actually Denmark wins these days. Denmark and Norway tend to win these days. Sweden doesn't do

12:06.720 --> 12:18.000
 badly. None of these are perfect. But look, I think by and large, there's a bit of a

12:18.000 --> 12:23.520
 pornography test. How do you know a decent society? Well, you kind of know it when you see it.

12:23.520 --> 12:26.160
 Right. Where does America stand on that?

12:26.160 --> 12:35.120
 We have a remarkable... There are a lot of virtues to America, but there's a level of harshness,

12:35.120 --> 12:44.000
 brutality, an ability for somebody who just has bad luck to fall off the edge, that is really,

12:46.320 --> 12:51.440
 shouldn't be happening in a country as rich as ours. So we have somehow managed to produce a

12:52.560 --> 12:58.960
 a crueller society than almost any other wealthy country for no good reason.

12:59.760 --> 13:04.080
 What do you think is lacking in the safety net that the United States provides? You said

13:04.080 --> 13:11.600
 there's a harshness to it. And what are the benefits and maybe limits of a safety net

13:11.600 --> 13:16.320
 in a country like ours? Well, every other advanced country has some

13:16.320 --> 13:20.960
 universal guarantee of adequate healthcare. The United States is the only place where

13:21.680 --> 13:27.440
 citizens can actually fail to get basic healthcare because they can't afford it.

13:27.440 --> 13:34.400
 It's not hard to do. Everybody else does it, but we don't. We've gotten a little bit better at it

13:34.400 --> 13:44.640
 than we were, but still, that's a big deal. We have remarkably weak support for children.

13:45.680 --> 13:53.280
 Most countries have substantial safety... Parents of young children get much more support elsewhere.

13:53.280 --> 14:04.080
 They get often nothing in the US. We have limited care for people. Long term care for the elderly

14:04.720 --> 14:14.400
 is a very hit and miss thing. But I think that the really big issues are that we don't take care of

14:14.400 --> 14:20.000
 children who make the mistake of having the wrong parents, and we don't take care of people who make

14:20.000 --> 14:25.600
 the mistake of getting sick. And those are things that a rich country should be doing.

14:26.320 --> 14:32.240
 Sorry for sort of a difficult question, but what you just said kind of feels like the right thing

14:32.240 --> 14:40.160
 to do in terms of a just society. But is it also good for the economic health of society to take

14:40.160 --> 14:44.880
 care of the people who are the unfortunate members of society?

14:44.880 --> 14:52.000
 By and large, it looks like doing the right thing in terms of justice is also the right thing in

14:52.000 --> 14:58.960
 terms of economics. If we're talking about a society that has extremely high tax rates that

14:58.960 --> 15:07.680
 deter, remove all incentives to provide a safety net that is so generous that why bother working

15:07.680 --> 15:13.440
 or striving, that could be a problem. But I don't actually know any society that looks like that.

15:13.440 --> 15:20.960
 Even in European countries with very generous safety nets, people work and innovate and do all

15:20.960 --> 15:28.480
 of these things. And there's a lot of evidence now that lacking those basics is actually destructive,

15:28.480 --> 15:32.960
 that children who grow up without adequate health care, without adequate nutrition,

15:34.640 --> 15:40.240
 are developmentally challenged. They don't live up to their potential as adults. So the United

15:40.240 --> 15:46.960
 States actually probably pays a price. We're harsh, we're cruel, and we actually make ourselves poorer

15:46.960 --> 15:51.520
 as a society, not just the individuals, by being so harsh and cruel.

15:52.400 --> 15:59.120
 Okay, so Invisible Hand, Smith, where does that fit in? The power of just people acting selfishly

16:00.000 --> 16:06.960
 and somehow everything taking care of itself to where the economy grows,

16:06.960 --> 16:14.640
 nobody, there's no cruelty, no injustice, that the markets regulate themselves. Is there power

16:14.640 --> 16:21.520
 to that idea and what are its limits? There's a lot of power to that. I mean, there's a reason why

16:23.120 --> 16:29.360
 I don't think sensible people want the government running steel mills or they want the government

16:29.360 --> 16:40.960
 to own the farms, right? The markets are a pretty effective way of getting incentives aligned,

16:40.960 --> 16:46.720
 of inducing people to do stuff that works. And the Invisible Hand is saying that farmers aren't

16:46.720 --> 16:51.120
 growing crops because they want to feed people, they're growing crops because they can make money

16:51.120 --> 16:56.960
 by it, but it actually turns out to be a pretty good way of getting an agrarian

16:56.960 --> 17:04.560
 of getting agricultural products grown. So the Invisible Hand is an important part,

17:04.560 --> 17:10.400
 but there's nothing mystical about it. It's a mechanism, it's a way to organize economic

17:10.400 --> 17:15.840
 activity, which works well given a bunch of preconditions, which means that it actually

17:15.840 --> 17:22.880
 works well for agriculture, it works well for manufacturing, it works well for many services,

17:22.880 --> 17:30.400
 it doesn't work well for healthcare, it doesn't work well for education. So having a society

17:30.400 --> 17:39.200
 which is kind of three quarters Invisible Hand and one quarter Visible Hand, something on that

17:39.200 --> 17:47.920
 order seems to be the balance that works best. You don't want to romanticize or make something

17:47.920 --> 17:54.880
 mystical out of it. This is one way to organize stuff that happens to have broad but not universal

17:54.880 --> 18:02.800
 application. So then forgive me for romanticizing it, but it does seem pretty magical. I kind of

18:02.800 --> 18:06.880
 have an intuitive understanding of what happens when you have like five, ten, maybe even a hundred

18:06.880 --> 18:12.640
 people together, the dynamics of that. But the fact that these large society of people for the

18:12.640 --> 18:17.440
 most part acting in a self interested way and maybe electing representatives for themselves,

18:17.440 --> 18:28.480
 that it all kind of seems to work, it's pretty magical. The fact that right now there's a wide

18:28.480 --> 18:39.200
 assortment of fresh fruit and vegetables in the local markets up and down the street, who's

18:39.200 --> 18:43.920
 planning that? And the answer is nobody. That's the Invisible Hand at work and that's great.

18:43.920 --> 18:55.360
 And that's a lesson that Adam Smith figured out more than 200 years ago and it continues to apply.

18:56.160 --> 19:01.600
 But even Adam Smith has a section in his book about why it's important to regulate banks.

19:02.480 --> 19:07.680
 So the Invisible Hand has its limits. And that example is actually a powerful one in terms of

19:07.680 --> 19:13.280
 the supermarket and fruit. That was my experience coming from Russia from the Soviet Union is when

19:13.280 --> 19:20.000
 I first entered a supermarket and just seeing the assortment of fruit, bananas. I don't think I've

19:20.000 --> 19:25.600
 seen bananas before, first of all, but just the selection of fresh fruit was just mind blowing.

19:27.120 --> 19:32.480
 Beyond words and the fact that, like you said, I don't know what made that happen.

19:32.480 --> 19:40.400
 Well, there is some magic to the market. As showing my age, but the old movie quote,

19:40.400 --> 19:43.520
 sometimes the magic works and sometimes it doesn't. And you have to have some idea of when

19:43.520 --> 19:51.120
 it doesn't. So how do you get regulation? What can government at its best do? Government,

19:52.400 --> 20:00.480
 strangely enough in this country today, seems to get a bad rap. Everybody's against the government.

20:01.120 --> 20:04.640
 Yeah. Well, a lot of money has been spent on making people hate the government.

20:04.640 --> 20:12.160
 But the reality is government does some things pretty well. I mean, government does health

20:12.160 --> 20:17.760
 insurance pretty well. So much so, I mean, given our anti government bias, it really is true that

20:17.760 --> 20:23.520
 there are people out there saying, don't let the government get its hands on Medicare. So

20:24.560 --> 20:28.800
 people actually love the government health insurance program far more than they love

20:28.800 --> 20:38.800
 private health insurance. Basic education. It turns out that your local public high school

20:38.800 --> 20:45.760
 is the right place to have students trained and private for, certainly for profit education is

20:46.800 --> 20:56.720
 by and large a nightmare of rip offs and grift and people not getting what they thought they

20:56.720 --> 21:03.520
 were paying for. It's a judgment case. And it's funny, there are things, I mean, everybody talks

21:05.520 --> 21:11.840
 about the DMV as being, do you want the economy? Actually, my experience is that the DMV have

21:11.840 --> 21:17.920
 always been positive. Maybe I'm just going to the right DMVs, but in fact, a lot of government works

21:17.920 --> 21:26.000
 pretty well. So to some extent, you can do these things on a priori grounds. You can talk about the

21:26.000 --> 21:30.800
 logic of why healthcare is not going to be handled well by the market, but partly it's just experience.

21:30.800 --> 21:34.800
 We tried, or at least some countries have tried nationalizing their steel industries,

21:34.800 --> 21:40.640
 that didn't go well. But we've tried privatizing education and that didn't go well. So you find

21:40.640 --> 21:49.120
 out what works. What about this new world of tech? How do you see, what do you think works for tech?

21:49.120 --> 21:56.320
 Is it more regulation or less regulation? There are some things that need more regulation. I mean,

21:56.320 --> 22:07.840
 we're finding out that the world of social media is one in which competitive forces aren't working

22:07.840 --> 22:14.000
 very well and trusting the companies to regulate themselves isn't working very well. But I'm on the

22:14.000 --> 22:19.440
 whole a tech skeptic, not in the sense that I think the tech doesn't work and it doesn't do stuff,

22:19.440 --> 22:23.760
 but the idea that we're living through greater technological change than ever before

22:24.400 --> 22:30.640
 is really an illusion. Ever since the beginning of the industrial revolution,

22:30.640 --> 22:38.400
 we've had a series of epical shifts in the nature of work and in the kinds of jobs that are available.

22:38.400 --> 22:46.720
 And it's not at all clear that what's happening now is any bigger or faster or harder to cope

22:46.720 --> 22:54.560
 with than past shocks. It is a popular notion in today's sort of public discourse that automation

22:54.560 --> 23:01.920
 is going to have a huge impact on the job market now. There is something transformational happening

23:01.920 --> 23:10.800
 now. Can you talk about that, maybe elaborate a little bit more? Do you not see the software

23:10.800 --> 23:18.320
 revolutions happening now with machine learning, availability of data, that kind of automation,

23:18.320 --> 23:25.360
 being able to sort of process, clean, find patterns in data, and you don't see that

23:25.360 --> 23:32.880
 disrupting any one sector to a point where there's a huge loss of jobs? There may be some things. I

23:32.880 --> 23:37.120
 mean, actually, you know, translators, there's really reduced demand for translators because

23:38.560 --> 23:45.200
 machine translation ain't perfect, but it ain't bad. There are some kinds of things that are

23:45.200 --> 23:56.800
 changed, but overall productivity growth has actually been slow in recent years. It's been much

23:56.800 --> 24:02.480
 slower than in some past periods. So the idea that automation is taking away all the jobs,

24:02.480 --> 24:07.840
 the counterpart would be that we would be able to produce stuff with many fewer workers than before,

24:07.840 --> 24:14.400
 and that's not happening. There are a few isolated sectors. There are some kinds of jobs that are

24:14.400 --> 24:20.480
 going away, but that keeps on happening. I mean, New York City used to have thousands and thousands

24:20.480 --> 24:29.760
 of longshoremen taking stuff off ships and putting them on ships. They're almost all gone now. Now

24:29.760 --> 24:34.960
 you have the giant cranes taking containers on and off ships in Elizabeth, New Jersey.

24:36.560 --> 24:44.000
 That's not robots. It doesn't sound high tech, but it actually pretty much destroyed an

24:44.000 --> 24:50.960
 occupation. Well, you know, it wasn't fun for the longshoremen, to say the least. But it's not,

24:52.560 --> 24:58.640
 we coped, we moved on, and that sort of thing happens all the time. You mean farmers.

25:00.640 --> 25:07.520
 We used to be a nation which was mostly farmers. There are now very few farmers left. And the

25:07.520 --> 25:14.000
 reason is not that we've stopped eating, it's that farming has become so efficient that we don't need

25:14.000 --> 25:19.920
 a lot of farmers, and we coped with that too. So the idea that there's something qualitatively

25:19.920 --> 25:26.880
 different about what's happening now so far isn't true. So your intuition is there is going to be

25:26.880 --> 25:32.320
 lots of jobs, but it's just the thing that just continues. There's nothing qualitatively different

25:32.320 --> 25:36.720
 about this moment. Some jobs will be lost, others will be created, as has always been the case so

25:36.720 --> 25:42.880
 far. I mean, maybe there's a singularity. Maybe there's a moment when the machines get smarter

25:42.880 --> 25:48.800
 than we are, and sky tech kills us all or something, right? But that's not visible in

25:48.800 --> 25:53.600
 anything we're seeing now. You mentioned the metric of productivity. Could you explain that

25:53.600 --> 25:58.080
 a little bit? Because it's a really interesting one. I've heard you mention that before in

25:58.080 --> 26:03.760
 connection with automation. So what is that metric? And if there is something qualitatively

26:03.760 --> 26:09.520
 different, what should we see in that metric? Well, okay, productivity. First of all, production.

26:09.520 --> 26:15.760
 We do have a measure of the economy's total production, you know, real GDP, which is

26:16.320 --> 26:21.280
 itself, it's a little bit of a construct because it's quite literally, it's adding apples and

26:21.280 --> 26:27.600
 oranges. So we have to add together various things, which we basically do by using market prices,

26:27.600 --> 26:32.800
 but we try to adjust for inflation. But it's kind of, it's a reasonable measure of how much

26:32.800 --> 26:37.040
 the economy is producing. Sorry to interrupt. Is it goods and services? It's goods and services.

26:37.040 --> 26:44.560
 It's everything. Okay. Productivity is, you divide that total output by the number of hours worked.

26:45.200 --> 26:51.680
 So we're basically asking how much stuff does the average worker produce in an hour of work.

26:52.320 --> 26:57.920
 And if you're seeing really rapid technological progress, then you'd expect to see productivity

26:57.920 --> 27:05.040
 rising at a rapid clip, which we did, you know, for the generation after World War II, productivity

27:05.040 --> 27:12.240
 rose, you know, 2% a year on a sustained basis. Then it dropped down for a while. Then there was

27:12.240 --> 27:17.040
 a kind of a decade of fairly rapid growth from the mid nineties to the mid two thousands.

27:18.240 --> 27:22.880
 And then it's, it dropped off again and it's not, it's not impressive right now. So

27:22.880 --> 27:29.680
 you're just not seeing an epical shift in, in, in the economy. So let me then ask you about

27:29.680 --> 27:34.720
 the psychology of blaming automation. A few months ago, you wrote in the New York Times,

27:34.720 --> 27:39.840
 quote, the other day I found myself, as I often do at a conference, discussing lagging wages and

27:39.840 --> 27:45.360
 soaring inequality. There was a lot of interesting discussion, but one thing that struck me was how

27:45.360 --> 27:50.880
 many of the participants just assumed that robots are a big part of the problem, that machines are

27:50.880 --> 27:56.400
 taking away the good jobs or even jobs in general. For the most part, this wasn't even presented as

27:56.400 --> 28:04.640
 a hypothesis, just as part of what everyone knows. So why is, maybe can you psychoanalyze our,

28:05.840 --> 28:12.480
 the public intellectuals or economists or us actually in the general public, why this is

28:12.480 --> 28:19.440
 happening? Why this assumption has just infiltrated public discourse? There's a couple of things.

28:19.440 --> 28:26.480
 One is that the particular technologies that are advancing now are ones that are a lot more visible

28:26.480 --> 28:37.120
 to the chattering class. When containerization did away with the jobs of longshoremen, well,

28:37.120 --> 28:43.280
 not a whole lot of college professors are close friends with longshoremen. And so we see this one.

28:43.280 --> 28:49.920
 Then there's a second thing, which is, we just went through a severe financial crisis

28:49.920 --> 28:56.880
 and a period of very high unemployment. It's finally come down. There's really no question

28:56.880 --> 29:01.520
 that that high unemployment was about macroeconomics. It was about a failure of demand.

29:02.160 --> 29:07.760
 But macroeconomics is really not intuitive. I mean, people just have a hard time wrapping

29:07.760 --> 29:11.360
 their minds around it. And among other things, people have a hard time believing that something

29:11.360 --> 29:16.160
 as trivial as, well, people who just aren't spending enough can lead to the kind of mass

29:16.160 --> 29:22.320
 misery that we saw in the 1930s or the not quite so severe, but still serious misery that we saw

29:22.320 --> 29:28.480
 after 2008. And there's always a tendency to say it must be something big. It must be technological

29:28.480 --> 29:33.600
 change. That means we don't need workers anymore. There was a lot of that in the 30s. And that same

29:33.600 --> 29:40.480
 thing happened after 2008, the assumption that it has to be some deep cause, not something as trivial

29:40.480 --> 29:46.240
 as a failure of investor confidence and inadequate monetary and fiscal response.

29:47.840 --> 29:57.280
 And the last thing on wages. A lot of what's happened on wages is at some level political.

29:57.280 --> 30:02.320
 It's the collapse of the union movement. It's policies that have squeezed workers bargaining

30:02.320 --> 30:08.880
 power. And for kind of obvious reasons, there are a lot of influential people who don't want to hear

30:08.880 --> 30:14.880
 that story. They want it to be an inevitable force of nature. Technology has made it impossible to

30:14.880 --> 30:23.440
 have people earn middle class wages. And so they don't like the story that says,

30:23.440 --> 30:28.240
 actually, no, it's kind of the political decisions that we made that have caused this income

30:28.240 --> 30:34.000
 stagnation. And so they're a receptive audience for technological determinism.

30:34.000 --> 30:40.640
 LW. So what comes first in your view, the economy or politics in terms of what has impact on the

30:40.640 --> 30:41.360
 other?

30:41.360 --> 30:48.800
 RL. Oh, look, everything interacts. That's one of the rules that I was taught in economics.

30:48.800 --> 30:57.440
 Everything affects everything else in at least two ways. I mean, clearly the economy drives a

30:57.440 --> 31:08.480
 lot of political stuff. But also clearly politics has a huge impact on the economy. We look at the

31:08.480 --> 31:14.320
 decline of unions in America and say, well, the world has changed and unions don't have a role.

31:15.040 --> 31:21.520
 But two thirds of workers in Denmark are unionized. And Denmark has the same technology

31:21.520 --> 31:26.640
 and faces the same global economy that we do. It's just a difference in political choices that leads

31:26.640 --> 31:33.760
 to that difference. So I actually teach a course here at CUNY called Economics of the Welfare

31:33.760 --> 31:38.800
 State, which is about things like healthcare and retirement and to some extent wage policy and so

31:38.800 --> 31:46.000
 on. And the message I keep on trying to drive home is that, look, all advanced countries have

31:46.000 --> 31:51.280
 got roughly equal competence. We all have the same technology, but we make very different choices.

31:51.840 --> 31:56.000
 Not that America always makes the wrong choices. We do some things pretty well. Our retirement

31:56.000 --> 32:03.120
 system is one of the better ones. But the point is that there's a huge amount of political choice

32:03.120 --> 32:09.840
 involved in the shape of the economy. What is a welfare state? Well, welfare state is the old

32:10.720 --> 32:17.520
 term, but it basically refers to all the programs that are there to mitigate, if you like, the

32:19.680 --> 32:25.200
 risks and injustices of the market economy. So in the US, the welfare state is Social Security,

32:25.200 --> 32:32.240
 Medicare, Medicaid, minimum wages, food stamps. When you say welfare state, my first sort of

32:32.240 --> 32:39.840
 feeling is a negative one. Even though I like all, I probably generally, at least theoretically,

32:39.840 --> 32:46.480
 like all the welfare programs. Well, it's been demonized. And to some extent, I'm doing a little

32:46.480 --> 32:53.520
 bit of thumbing my nose at all of that by just using the term welfare state. Although it's not.

32:53.520 --> 32:59.600
 I see. Yeah, I got you. But everybody, every advanced country actually has a lot of welfare

32:59.600 --> 33:07.200
 state, even the US. I mean, that's a fundamental part of the fabric of our society. Social Security,

33:07.200 --> 33:17.840
 Medicare, Medicaid are just things we take for granted as part of the scene. There's a lot of

33:17.840 --> 33:25.040
 there's people on the right wing who are saying, oh, it's all socialism. And well,

33:25.040 --> 33:33.360
 words, I guess, mean what you want them to mean. And just today, I told my class about the

33:36.160 --> 33:41.840
 record that Ronald Reagan made in 1961, warning that Medicare would destroy American freedom.

33:41.840 --> 33:50.000
 And but that sort of didn't happen on the topic of welfare state. What are your thoughts on

33:50.000 --> 33:58.800
 universal basic income? And that's sort of a not a generic, but a universal safety net of this kind?

33:58.800 --> 34:04.320
 There's always a trade off when we talk about social safety net programs. There's always a

34:04.320 --> 34:12.400
 trade off between universality, which is clean, but means that you're giving a lot of money to

34:12.400 --> 34:19.120
 people who don't necessarily need it and some kind of targeting, which makes it easier to

34:20.720 --> 34:27.520
 get to deal with the crucial problems with limited resources. But both has incentive

34:27.520 --> 34:36.480
 problems and kind of political and I would say even psychological issues. So the great thing

34:36.480 --> 34:44.000
 about Social Security and Medicare is no questions asked. You don't have to prove that you need them.

34:45.280 --> 34:54.800
 It just comes. I'm on Medicare, allegedly. I mean, it's run through my New York Times health

34:54.800 --> 35:02.160
 insurance, but I didn't have to file an application with the Medicare office to prove that I needed it.

35:02.160 --> 35:08.160
 It just happened when I turned 65. That's good for dignity and it's also good for

35:08.800 --> 35:15.360
 the political support because everybody gets Medicare. On the other hand, if you

35:15.360 --> 35:24.640
 and we can do that with health care to give everybody a guarantee of an income that's

35:24.640 --> 35:32.480
 enough to live on comfortably. That's a lot of money. What about enough income to carry you over

35:34.240 --> 35:38.000
 through difficult periods, like if you lose a job or that kind of? Well, we have unemployment

35:38.000 --> 35:44.080
 insurance and I think our unemployment insurance is too short lived and too stingy. It would be

35:44.080 --> 35:51.840
 better to have a more comprehensive unemployment insurance benefit. But the trouble with something

35:51.840 --> 35:58.720
 like universal basic income is that either the bar is too low, so it's really not something you

35:58.720 --> 36:05.680
 can live on, or it's an enormously expensive program. And so at this point, I think that

36:05.680 --> 36:12.000
 we can do far better by building on the kinds of safety net programs we have. I mean, food stamps,

36:12.000 --> 36:17.280
 earned income tax credit. We should have a lot more family support policies.

36:17.280 --> 36:23.280
 Those things can do a lot more to really diminish the amount of misery in this country.

36:24.240 --> 36:32.560
 UBI is something that is being... I mean, it goes kind of hand in hand with this belief that

36:33.120 --> 36:37.440
 the robots are going to take all of our jobs. And if that was really happening, then I might

36:37.440 --> 36:45.840
 reconsider my views on UPI, but I don't see that happening. So are you happy with discourse that's

36:45.840 --> 36:52.160
 going on now in terms of politics? So you mentioned a few political candidates. Is the kind of thing

36:52.160 --> 36:59.680
 going on both on Twitter and debates and the media through the written word, through the spoken word,

37:00.240 --> 37:05.120
 how do you assess the public discourse now in terms of politics? We're in a fragmented world.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.680
 More so than before.

37:07.680 --> 37:20.560
 More so than ever before. So at this point, the public discourse that you see if Fox News is your

37:20.560 --> 37:25.600
 principal news source is very different from the one you get if you read the New York Times.

37:26.160 --> 37:33.840
 On the whole, my sense is that mainstream political reporting, policy reporting is a,

37:33.840 --> 37:40.880
 not too great, but b, better than it's ever been. Because when I first got into the pundit business,

37:41.440 --> 37:46.640
 it was just awful. Lots of things just never got covered. And if things did get covered,

37:46.640 --> 37:53.680
 it was always both sides. It's the line that comes back from me writing during the 2000

37:53.680 --> 38:00.320
 campaign was that if one of the candidates said that the earth was flat, the headline would

38:00.320 --> 38:06.560
 be views differ on shape of planet. I mean, that's less true. There's still a fair bit of

38:06.560 --> 38:12.240
 that out there, but it's less true than there used to be. And there are more people reporting,

38:12.240 --> 38:18.880
 writing on policy issues who actually understand them than ever before. So though that's good.

38:18.880 --> 38:34.640
 But still, how much the typical voter is actually informed is unclear. I mean, the Democratic

38:34.640 --> 38:44.560
 debates, I'm hoping that we finally get down to not having 27 people on the stage or whatever it

38:44.560 --> 38:52.880
 is they have, but they're reasonably substantive, certainly better than before. And while there's

38:52.880 --> 39:00.560
 a lot of still theater criticism instead of actual analysis and the reporting, it's not as totally

39:00.560 --> 39:09.200
 dominant as in the past. Can I ask maybe a dumb question, but from an open minded perspective,

39:09.200 --> 39:21.920
 when people on the left and people on the right, I think view the others as sometimes complete

39:21.920 --> 39:32.560
 idiots. What do we do with that? Is it possible that the people on the right are correct about

39:32.560 --> 39:42.480
 their what they currently believe? Is that kind of open mindedness helpful or is this division

39:43.280 --> 39:47.280
 long term productive for us to sort of have this food fight?

39:48.480 --> 39:55.680
 Well, the trouble you have to confront is that there's a lot of stuff that just is false out

39:55.680 --> 40:02.160
 there but commands extensive political allegiance. So the idea, well, both sides need to listen to

40:02.160 --> 40:09.840
 each other respectfully. I'm happy to do that when there's a view that is worthy of respect,

40:09.840 --> 40:18.000
 but a lot of stuff is not. And so take economics is something where I think I know something,

40:18.560 --> 40:24.800
 and I'm not sure that I'm always right. In fact, I know I've been wrong plenty of times. But I

40:24.800 --> 40:33.280
 think that there is a difference between economic views that are within the realm of we can actually

40:33.280 --> 40:42.560
 have an interesting discussion and those that are just crank doctrines or things that are purely

40:42.560 --> 40:47.920
 being disseminated because people are being paid to disseminate them. So there are plenty of good,

40:47.920 --> 40:54.800
 serious center right economists that I'm happy to talk to. None of those center right economists

40:54.800 --> 40:59.280
 has any role in the Trump administration. The Trump administration and by and large Republicans

40:59.280 --> 41:07.680
 in Congress only want to listen to people who are cranks. And so I think it's being dishonest with

41:07.680 --> 41:12.400
 my readers to pretend otherwise. There's no way I can reach out to people who think that

41:12.400 --> 41:16.480
 reading Ayn Rand novels is how you learn about monetary economics.

41:17.200 --> 41:22.000
 Let me linger on that point. So if you look at Ayn Rand, okay, so you said center right. What

41:22.000 --> 41:31.600
 about extreme? People who have like radical views, you think they're not grounded in any kind of data,

41:31.600 --> 41:37.920
 in any kind of reality. I'm just sort of curious about how open we should be

41:37.920 --> 41:44.320
 to ideas that seem radical. Oh, radical ideas is fine, but then you have to ask, is there some

41:44.320 --> 41:53.920
 basis for the radicalism? And if it's something that is not grounded in anything,

41:55.440 --> 41:59.840
 then, and particularly, by the way, if it's something that's been refuted by evidence again

41:59.840 --> 42:03.440
 and again, and the people just keep saying it, if it's a zombie, if it's a

42:03.440 --> 42:08.560
 zombie idea, and there's a lot of those out there, then there comes a point when it's not worth

42:09.600 --> 42:14.560
 trying to fake respect for it. I see. So there's a, through the scientific process,

42:14.560 --> 42:19.760
 you've shown that this idea does not hold water, but I like the idea of zombie ideas,

42:19.760 --> 42:25.040
 but they live on through, it's like the idea that the earth is flat, for example,

42:26.160 --> 42:28.880
 has been for the most part, disproven. Yeah.

42:28.880 --> 42:34.480
 But it lives on, actually, and growing in popularity currently. Yeah. And there's a lot

42:34.480 --> 42:41.520
 of that out there, and you can't wish it away, and you're not being fair to either yourself,

42:41.520 --> 42:46.160
 or if you're somebody who writes for the public, you're not being fair to your readers to pretend

42:46.160 --> 42:53.920
 otherwise. So quantum mechanics is a strange theory, but it's testable, and so while being

42:53.920 --> 43:00.400
 strange, it's widely accepted amongst physicists. How robust and testable are economics theories

43:01.440 --> 43:08.160
 if we compare them to quantum mechanics and physics and so on? Okay, economics, look, it's a

43:08.160 --> 43:13.920
 complex system, and it's also one in which, by and large, you don't get to do experiments,

43:14.480 --> 43:18.480
 and so economics is never going to be like quantum mechanics.

43:18.480 --> 43:26.160
 That said, you get natural experiments, you get tests of rival doctrines. In the immediate

43:26.160 --> 43:35.600
 aftermath of the financial crisis, there was one style, one basic theory of macroeconomics, which

43:36.560 --> 43:40.960
 ultimately goes back to John Maynard Keynes that made a few predictions. It said, under these

43:40.960 --> 43:48.080
 circumstances, the economy is going to collapse. It's going to collapse. It's going to collapse.

43:48.080 --> 43:54.800
 Printing money will not be inflationary. Running big budget deficits will not cause a rise in

43:54.800 --> 44:02.240
 interest rates. Slashing government spending austerity policies will lead to depressions if

44:02.240 --> 44:11.120
 tried. Other people had exactly the opposite predictions, and we got a fairly robust test,

44:11.120 --> 44:17.600
 and one theory won. Interest rates stayed low. Inflation stayed low. Austerity, countries that

44:17.600 --> 44:24.400
 implemented harsh austerity policies suffered severe economic downturns. You don't get much,

44:24.400 --> 44:28.400
 you know, that's pretty clear, and that's not going to be true on everything,

44:29.440 --> 44:36.560
 but there's a lot of empirical. I mean, the younger economists these days are very heavily

44:36.560 --> 44:42.000
 data based, and that's great, and I think that's the way to go.

44:42.000 --> 44:47.440
 Trey Lockerbie What theories of economics are there? Is there currently a lot of disagreement about, would you say?

44:47.440 --> 44:54.560
 John Ligato Oh, first of all, there's just a lot less disagreement, really, among serious

44:54.560 --> 45:00.800
 researchers in economics than people imagine. We actually, we can track that. The Chicago Booth

45:00.800 --> 45:07.520
 School has a panel, an ideologically diverse panel, and they pose regularly posed questions,

45:07.520 --> 45:16.160
 and on most things, there's a huge, there's remarkable consensus. There's a lot of things

45:16.160 --> 45:22.240
 where people imagine that there's dispute, but the illusion of dispute is something that's

45:22.240 --> 45:28.960
 basically being fed by political forces, and there isn't really. I mean, there are, I think,

45:28.960 --> 45:37.760
 questions about what are effective ways to regulate technology industries. We really don't know

45:41.520 --> 45:50.560
 the answers there. There's a, or, look, I don't follow every part. Minimum wages. I think there's

45:50.560 --> 45:57.280
 pretty overwhelming evidence that a modest increase in the minimum wage from current levels

45:57.280 --> 46:06.960
 would be, would not have any noticeable adverse effect on jobs. But if you ask, how high could it

46:06.960 --> 46:17.040
 go? $12 seems pretty safe, given what we know. Is $15 okay? There's some legitimate disagreement

46:17.040 --> 46:24.880
 there, I think probably, but people have a point. $20, where is the line at which it starts to

46:24.880 --> 46:29.440
 become a problem, and the answer is, truly, we don't know. It's fascinating to try to,

46:30.080 --> 46:35.120
 such a cool, economics is cool in that sense, because you're trying to predict something that

46:35.120 --> 46:39.440
 hasn't been done before, the impact, the effects of something that hasn't been done before.

46:40.160 --> 46:45.200
 Yeah, you're trying, you're going out of sample, and we have good reason to believe that there are,

46:46.560 --> 46:49.840
 you know, that it's nonlinear, that there comes a point at which it doesn't work the way it has

46:49.840 --> 46:56.560
 in the past. So, as an economist, how do you see science and technological innovation? When I

46:56.560 --> 47:02.160
 took various economics courses in college, technological innovation seemed like a

47:02.160 --> 47:09.280
 no brainer way of growing an economy, and we should invest in it aggressively. I may be biased,

47:09.280 --> 47:14.720
 but it seemed like the various ways to grow an economy, it seems like the easiest way,

47:14.720 --> 47:20.560
 especially long term. Is that correct? And if so, why aren't we doing it more?

47:20.560 --> 47:26.880
 Well, that's, okay, the first question is, yeah, I mean, all, it's pretty much overwhelming.

47:27.920 --> 47:31.520
 We think we can more or less measure this, although there are some assumptions involved,

47:31.520 --> 47:38.480
 but it's something like 70 to 80% of the growth in per capita income is basically the advance

47:38.480 --> 47:43.520
 of knowledge. It's not just, it's not just the crude accumulation of capital. It is the fact

47:43.520 --> 47:50.560
 that we get smarter. A lot of that, by the way, is more prosaic kinds of technology. So, you know,

47:52.960 --> 47:57.760
 I like to talk about things like containerization, or, you know, in an earlier period,

48:01.280 --> 48:10.000
 the invention of the flat pack cardboard box. That had to be invented, and now all of your

48:10.000 --> 48:14.720
 deliveries from Amazon are made possible by the existence of that technology. The web stuff is

48:15.760 --> 48:19.040
 important too, but what would we do without cardboard boxes?

48:20.400 --> 48:26.160
 But all of that stuff is really important in driving economic progress. Well, why don't we

48:26.160 --> 48:36.560
 invest more? Why don't we invest more in, again, more prosaic stuff? Why haven't we built another

48:36.560 --> 48:44.320
 goddamn rail tunnel under the Hudson River, for which the need is so totally overwhelmingly

48:44.320 --> 48:48.000
 obvious? How do you think about, first of all, I don't even know what the word prosaic means,

48:48.000 --> 48:54.320
 but I inferred it, but how do you think about prosaic? Is it the really most basic, dumb

48:54.320 --> 49:02.800
 technology innovation, or is it just like the lowest hanging fruit of where benefit can be

49:02.800 --> 49:11.760
 gained? When I say prosaic, I mean stuff that is not sexy and fancy and high tech. It's building

49:11.760 --> 49:24.400
 bridges and tunnels, inventing the cardboard box, or the, I don't know, where do we put

49:24.400 --> 49:34.800
 EasyPass in there? It is actually using some modern technology and all that, but it's not

49:34.800 --> 49:41.120
 going to have, I don't think we're going to make a movie about the guy, whoever it was that invented

49:41.120 --> 49:47.680
 EasyPass, but it's actually a pretty significant productivity booster. To me, it always seemed like

49:47.680 --> 49:55.360
 it's something that everybody should be able to agree on and just invest. So in the same way,

49:56.160 --> 50:05.440
 the investment in the military and the DOD is huge. So everyone kind of, not everyone, but

50:05.440 --> 50:15.280
 there's an agreement amongst people that somehow that a large defense is important. It always

50:15.280 --> 50:22.720
 seemed to me like that should be shifted towards, if you want to grow prosperity of the nation,

50:22.720 --> 50:28.320
 you should be investing in knowledge. Yes, prosaic stuff, investing in infrastructure and so on.

50:29.200 --> 50:34.080
 I mean, sorry to linger on it, but do you have any intuition? Do you have a hope that that changes?

50:35.040 --> 50:38.240
 Do you have intuition why it's not changing? It's unclear.

50:38.240 --> 50:42.240
 More than intuition, I have a theory. I'm reasonably certain that I understand why

50:42.240 --> 50:55.680
 we don't do it. And it's because we have a real values dispute about the welfare state,

50:55.680 --> 51:02.080
 about how much the government should do to help the unfortunate. And politicians believe,

51:04.320 --> 51:09.200
 probably rightly, that there's a kind of halo effect that surrounds any kind of government

51:09.200 --> 51:17.600
 intervention. That even though providing people with enhanced social security benefits is really

51:17.600 --> 51:23.520
 very different from building a tunnel under the Hudson River, politicians of both parties seem

51:23.520 --> 51:28.240
 to believe that if the government is seen to be successful at doing one kind of thing,

51:28.240 --> 51:33.120
 it will make people think more favorably on doing other kinds of things. And so we have

51:33.120 --> 51:39.680
 conservatives tend to be opposed to any kind of increase in government spending, except military,

51:39.680 --> 51:46.720
 no matter how obviously a good idea it is, because they fear that it's the thin end of

51:46.720 --> 51:52.480
 the wedge for bigger government in general. And to some extent, liberals tend to favor

51:53.040 --> 51:59.760
 spending on these things, partly because they see it as a way of proving that government can

51:59.760 --> 52:11.360
 do things well, and therefore it can turn to broader social goals. What you might have thought

52:11.360 --> 52:15.440
 would be a technocratic discussion about government investment, both in research and

52:15.440 --> 52:21.520
 in infrastructure, is contaminated by the fact that government is government and people link it

52:21.520 --> 52:28.560
 to other government actions. Perhaps a silly question, but as a species, we're currently

52:28.560 --> 52:35.040
 working on venturing out into space, one day colonizing Mars. So when we start a society

52:35.040 --> 52:41.040
 on Mars from scratch, what political and economic system should it operate under?

52:41.920 --> 52:45.760
 Oh, I'm a big believer in... First of all, I don't think we're actually going to do that,

52:45.760 --> 52:54.000
 but let's hypothesize that we colonize Mars or something. Look, representative democracy

52:54.000 --> 53:06.960
 versus pure democracy. Well, yeah, pure democracy where people vote directly on everything is really

53:06.960 --> 53:16.000
 problematic, because people don't have time to try and master every issue. I mean, we can see

53:16.000 --> 53:21.920
 what government by referendum looks like. There's a lot of that in California, and it doesn't work

53:21.920 --> 53:26.800
 so good because it's hard to explain to people that the various things they vote for may conflict.

53:26.800 --> 53:37.520
 So representative democracy, it's got lots of problems. And kind of the Winston Churchill thing,

53:37.520 --> 53:43.760
 right? It's the worst system we know, except for all the others. So yeah, sticking with the

53:43.760 --> 53:52.240
 representative and basically the American system of regulation and markets and the economy we have

53:52.240 --> 53:57.760
 going on is a pretty good one for Mars. If you start from scratch. If you're gonna start from

53:57.760 --> 54:04.320
 scratch, you wouldn't want a Senate where 16% of the population has half the seats.

54:06.160 --> 54:11.360
 You probably would want one which is actually more representative than what we have.

54:11.360 --> 54:22.080
 And the details, it's unclear. When times are good, all of the various representative

54:22.080 --> 54:30.480
 democracy systems, whether it's parliamentary democracies or a US style system, whether you

54:30.480 --> 54:35.120
 have a prime minister or the head of state as an elected president, they all kind of work well,

54:36.080 --> 54:40.240
 when times are good, and they all have different modes of breakdown. So I'm not sure I know what

54:40.240 --> 54:49.760
 the answer is. But something like that is given what we've seen through history, it's the least

54:49.760 --> 55:02.240
 bad system out there. I'm a big fan of the TV series The Expanse, and it's kind of gratifying

55:02.240 --> 55:13.600
 that out there, it's the Martian Congressional Republic. In a brief sense, so amongst many things,

55:13.600 --> 55:24.000
 you're also an expert at international trade. What do you make of the complexity? So I can

55:24.000 --> 55:30.560
 understand trade between two people, say two neighboring farmers. It seems pretty straightforward

55:30.560 --> 55:35.280
 to me. But internationally, we need to start talking about nations and nations trading seems

55:35.280 --> 55:42.080
 to be very complicated. So from a high level, why is it so complicated? What are all the different

55:42.080 --> 55:48.720
 factors that weigh the objectives that need to be considered in international trade? And maybe

55:48.720 --> 55:55.680
 feeding that into a question of, do you have concerns about the two giants right now of the

55:55.680 --> 56:01.520
 U.S. and China, and the tension that's going on with the international trade there with the trade

56:01.520 --> 56:05.680
 war? Well, first of all, international trade is not really that different from trade among

56:05.680 --> 56:15.200
 individuals. It's vastly more complex, and there are many more players. But in the end, the reasons

56:15.200 --> 56:19.280
 why countries trade are pretty much the same as the reasons why individuals trade. Countries trade

56:19.280 --> 56:25.120
 because they're different, and they can derive mutual advantage from concentrating on the things

56:25.120 --> 56:36.320
 they do relatively well. And also, there are economies of scale. Individuals have to decide

56:36.320 --> 56:42.160
 whether to be a surgeon or an accountant. It's probably not a good idea to try and be both,

56:42.160 --> 56:48.400
 and countries benefit from specializing just because of the inherent advantages of specialization.

56:48.400 --> 56:56.160
 Now, the fact that it's a big world, and we're talking about millions of products being traded,

56:56.160 --> 57:05.040
 and in today's world, often trade involves many stages. So that made in China iPhone is actually

57:05.840 --> 57:11.520
 assembled from components that are made all over the world. But it doesn't really change the

57:11.520 --> 57:22.080
 fundamentals all that much. There's a recurrent... I mean, the dirty little secret of international

57:22.080 --> 57:27.840
 trade conflict is that actually it's not... Conflicts among countries are really not that

57:27.840 --> 57:37.440
 important. Most trade is beneficial to both sides and to both countries, but it has big impacts on

57:37.440 --> 57:44.720
 the distribution of income within countries. So the growth of US trade with China has made both

57:44.720 --> 57:52.320
 US and China richer, but it's been pretty bad for people who were employed in the North Carolina

57:52.320 --> 57:58.480
 furniture industry, who did find that their jobs were displaced by a wave of imports from China.

57:58.480 --> 58:08.000
 And so that's where the complexity comes in. Not at all clear to me. We have some real problems

58:08.000 --> 58:14.480
 with China, although they don't really involve trade so much as things like respect for intellectual

58:14.480 --> 58:22.080
 property. Not clear that those real problems that we do have with China have anything to do with the

58:22.080 --> 58:28.960
 current trade war. The current trade war seems to be driven instead by a fundamentally wrong notion

58:28.960 --> 58:33.680
 that when we sell goods to China, that's good, and when we buy goods from China, that's bad. And

58:33.680 --> 58:39.600
 that's misunderstanding the whole point. Is trade with China in both directions a good thing?

58:40.480 --> 58:46.720
 Yeah, we would be poorer if it wasn't for it. But there are downsides, as there are for any economic

58:46.720 --> 58:53.520
 change. It's like any new technology makes us richer, but often hurts some people. Trade with

58:53.520 --> 59:01.680
 China makes us richer, but hurts some people. And I wouldn't undo what has happened, but I wish we

59:01.680 --> 59:07.680
 had had a better policy for supporting and compensating the losers from that growth.

59:09.200 --> 59:14.880
 So we live in a time of radicalization of political ideas, Twitter mobs, and so on.

59:14.880 --> 59:21.600
 And yet here you are in the midst of it, both tweeting and writing in the New York Times articles

59:21.600 --> 59:29.040
 with strong opinions, riding this chaotic wave of public discourse. Do you ever hesitate or feel

59:29.040 --> 59:34.160
 a tinge of fear for exploring your ideas publicly and unapologetically?

59:34.160 --> 59:40.640
 Oh, I feel fear all the time. It's not too hard to imagine scenarios in which this is going to,

59:40.640 --> 59:49.360
 you know, I might personally find myself kind of in the crosshairs. And I mean, I am the

59:49.360 --> 59:55.600
 king of hate mail. I get amazing correspondence. Does it affect you?

59:55.600 --> 1:00:00.000
 It did. It did when it started. These days I've developed a very thick skin.

1:00:01.600 --> 1:00:07.520
 So I don't usually get, in fact, if I don't get a wave of hate mail after a column, then

1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:10.480
 I've probably wasted that day.

1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:16.240
 So what do you make of that as a person who's putting ideas out there? If you look at the

1:00:16.240 --> 1:00:22.400
 history of ideas, the way it works is you write about ideas, you put them out there. But now

1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:29.120
 when there's so much hate mail, so much division, what advice do you have for yourself and for

1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:33.200
 others trying to have a discussion about ideas, difficult ideas?

1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:40.720
 Well, I don't know about advice for others. I mean, for most economists, you know, just

1:00:40.720 --> 1:00:46.880
 do your research. We can't all be public intellectuals and we shouldn't try to be.

1:00:46.880 --> 1:00:55.360
 And in fact, I'm glad that I didn't get into this business until I was in my late 40s. I mean,

1:00:55.360 --> 1:01:03.840
 this is probably best to spend your decades of greatest intellectual flexibility addressing

1:01:03.840 --> 1:01:12.880
 deep questions, not confronting Twitter mobs. And as for the rest, I think when you're writing

1:01:12.880 --> 1:01:23.280
 about stuff, the answers like no one's watching, write like nobody's reading. Write what you think

1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:28.480
 is right. Trying to make it, obviously, trying to make it comprehensible and persuasive. But

1:01:29.840 --> 1:01:38.080
 don't let yourself get intimidated by the fact that some people are going to say nasty things.

1:01:40.400 --> 1:01:47.200
 You can't do your job if you are worried about criticism.

1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:52.320
 Well, I think I speak for a lot of people in saying that I hope that you keep dancing like

1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:58.960
 nobody's watching on Twitter and New York Times and books. So Paul, it's been an honor. Thank you

1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:03.920
 so much for talking to me. Great. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Paul Krugman.

1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:39.840
 from Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations, one of the most influential philosophers and economists

1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:45.280
 in our history. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we

1:02:45.280 --> 1:02:51.280
 expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves not to their

1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:59.040
 humanity, but to their self love and never talk to them of our necessities, but of their advantages.

1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:14.400
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
