00:00.000 --> 00:04.600
 The following is a conversation with Albert Berla, CEO of Pfizer.

00:04.600 --> 00:09.840
 If you'd like to skip ahead to our conversation, the timestamps as always are below.

00:09.840 --> 00:15.560
 But if not, please allow me to say a few words about truth and human nature.

00:15.560 --> 00:21.880
 Specifically, about two groups of people throughout history that seek to lay claim to the truth.

00:21.880 --> 00:25.760
 The first group will tell you that only they possess the truth,

00:25.760 --> 00:32.840
 and that the government will save you, the company will save you, the science, the authorities, the experts, the institutions will save you.

00:32.840 --> 00:37.360
 The second group, too, will tell you that only they possess the truth,

00:37.360 --> 00:44.520
 and that the government will hurt you, the company will hurt you, the science, the authorities, the experts, the institutions will hurt you.

00:44.520 --> 00:50.680
 Both groups have the benevolent and the malevolent, their heroes and their charlatans.

00:50.680 --> 00:57.720
 And I think the hard truth is that no one in this world can tell you with absolute certainty which is which.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.640
 You have to use your mind.

00:59.640 --> 01:03.800
 This is the burden of being human, of being free.

01:03.800 --> 01:11.440
 Don't blindly follow any leader, neither the emperor nor the martyr who points out that the emperor has no clothes.

01:11.440 --> 01:14.720
 And then there's the lessons of history.

01:14.720 --> 01:19.400
 Vaccines have saved hundreds of millions of lives in the past century,

01:19.400 --> 01:23.320
 and in general, the advance of medicine has saved billions of lives.

01:23.320 --> 01:28.320
 If you ignore the power of science, you're not being honest with the lessons of history.

01:28.320 --> 01:33.040
 And if you ignore the corrupting nature of power and money within institutions,

01:33.040 --> 01:39.840
 including governments and companies that led to the suffering and death of hundreds of millions in the past century,

01:39.840 --> 01:45.040
 you are once again not being honest with the lessons of history.

01:45.040 --> 01:52.080
 I announced that I will be having this conversation with Albert Burla, Pfizer CEO, and a lot of people wrote to me.

01:52.080 --> 01:59.920
 I would like to say that I was and am and always will be listening and learning with an open mind from everyone.

01:59.920 --> 02:08.720
 My own opinion, worth little as it is, is that the development of the COVID vaccines is one of the greatest accomplishments of science in recent history.

02:08.720 --> 02:13.080
 For the rest, from safety and efficacy to policy and economics,

02:13.080 --> 02:18.240
 I stand humbled before a complicated world full of fear and anger.

02:18.240 --> 02:24.800
 A small number of malicious people from all walks of life will use that fear and anger to divide us,

02:24.800 --> 02:29.120
 because the division makes them money and gives them power.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.280
 I took two shots of the Pfizer vaccine.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.840
 This was my decision.

02:32.840 --> 02:39.200
 I don't ever want to force this on anyone, and I certainly don't want to dismiss your concerns or worse,

02:39.200 --> 02:43.120
 you as a person if you choose not to get vaccinated.

02:43.120 --> 02:47.920
 I can assure you one thing, in this conversation, and in any conversation,

02:47.920 --> 02:52.520
 the choice of questions I ask and words I say is mine and mine alone.

02:52.520 --> 03:00.320
 When my words fall short, as they often do, it is only because of the limitations of my mind and of my speaking ability.

03:00.320 --> 03:03.200
 It is not due to pressure or fear.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.200
 I'm not afraid of anyone.

03:05.200 --> 03:09.000
 I cannot be bought by anyone with money, power, or fame.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.520
 I hope to prove this to you and to myself in the coming years.

03:13.520 --> 03:19.160
 This life is short, and to me, without integrity, it is not worth living.

03:19.160 --> 03:22.720
 People sometimes talk down to me, call me naive.

03:22.720 --> 03:26.760
 Perhaps they are right, but it is who I am.

03:26.760 --> 03:32.480
 I think this life, this world, this, our human civilization is beautiful.

03:32.480 --> 03:37.560
 And as Dostoevsky said, beauty will save the world.

03:37.560 --> 03:43.800
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here's my conversation with Albert Borla.

03:43.800 --> 03:50.880
 The development of the COVID 19 vaccine was one of the greatest accomplishments of science in recent history.

03:50.880 --> 03:54.360
 No matter what, this should give people hope for the future.

03:54.360 --> 03:57.640
 And yet, it is more of a source of division.

03:57.640 --> 04:02.560
 I hope we can discuss both the inspiring and the difficult ideas in this conversation

04:02.560 --> 04:06.440
 so that we can do our small part in healing this division.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.720
 I hope so.

04:07.720 --> 04:10.080
 Take me through the day of November 8th, 2020,

04:10.080 --> 04:14.880
 when the Pfizer team were waiting for the results of the phase three clinical trials.

04:14.880 --> 04:20.440
 We had assembled in a very small office that we are having in Connecticut, very few people.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.320
 There were five, I think.

04:22.320 --> 04:28.640
 And in another place, what we call the Data Monitoring Committee,

04:28.640 --> 04:32.240
 which is a group of experts, independent experts, they're on Pfizer,

04:32.240 --> 04:36.920
 we're going to have the opportunity to unblind the data

04:36.920 --> 04:44.160
 and then tell us if the study needs to continue or if it is successful or if it fails.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.920
 And we were waiting for their call.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.600
 So the call came a little bit later than what we expected,

04:49.600 --> 04:55.160
 which created a lot of anxiety to all of us, but came around, I think, two o clock.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.600
 You're just sitting there waiting? What were you feeling?

04:57.600 --> 05:04.480
 Sitting there waiting and teasing one another, drinking coffee, making jokes.

05:04.480 --> 05:11.360
 So how did you feel like when you heard the results, the successful results?

05:11.360 --> 05:16.080
 Free, liberated, happy.

05:16.080 --> 05:23.280
 Like if a huge weight that was on my shoulders was lifted.

05:23.280 --> 05:27.840
 I heard you said, I love you to the team.

05:27.840 --> 05:33.000
 I did. This is how we speak in Mediterranean.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.400
 Listen, maybe it's the Russian thing too.

05:35.400 --> 05:41.200
 I love love, so I appreciate that kind of celebration.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.560
 So looking back from that moment to before,

05:43.560 --> 05:48.040
 how much did it cost to develop the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine?

05:48.040 --> 05:51.680
 What was it like making the decision to make that investment

05:51.680 --> 05:56.200
 when the risk is very high and you don't know if it's going to be successful?

05:56.200 --> 05:58.120
 You know, we do a lot of that anyway.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.800
 This is what we do in our daily work.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.880
 We are putting money.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.840
 We are investing in research, which is highly risky.

06:05.840 --> 06:09.240
 The difference in that case was that we didn't risk at all.

06:09.240 --> 06:10.880
 We put it all in.

06:10.880 --> 06:15.640
 We put everything in one go so that we don't lose time.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.600
 Usually, we will spend 50 millions.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.400
 And then if that goes well, then we will spend another 50.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.240
 And then if it goes well, then 100.

06:22.240 --> 06:28.720
 Here, we put all together a little bit more than $2 billion, $2.3 billion.

06:28.720 --> 06:33.680
 And it was a significant decision.

06:33.680 --> 06:38.120
 But it was a very easy decision to make in the context of what

06:38.120 --> 06:39.680
 we were living at that time.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.080
 It was a pandemic.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.080
 People were scared.

06:42.080 --> 06:42.960
 We were scared.

06:42.960 --> 06:46.440
 We didn't know how tomorrow would look like.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.120
 We were living unprecedented situations.

06:49.120 --> 06:54.280
 And we knew that we have capabilities that may help.

06:54.280 --> 06:57.600
 So there was not a second question or choice.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.120
 We go all in.

06:59.120 --> 07:02.160
 When you make decisions like that, you're

07:02.160 --> 07:08.000
 the CEO of a company that needs to make money

07:08.000 --> 07:12.680
 and that hopes to do a lot of good in the world.

07:12.680 --> 07:17.360
 How much of both of those things are part of the calculation?

07:17.360 --> 07:21.560
 So when you said it was an obvious choice,

07:21.560 --> 07:25.840
 I think you've said a bunch of things of the kind of saying

07:25.840 --> 07:31.320
 we need to go all in, sort of very boldly diving in.

07:31.320 --> 07:37.240
 How much was that the world is facing uncertainty and fear

07:37.240 --> 07:40.960
 and potentially destructive pandemic in the early days,

07:40.960 --> 07:43.440
 just when you're seeing the full uncertainty before us,

07:43.440 --> 07:45.240
 don't know how it's going to unroll?

07:45.240 --> 07:48.320
 And how much of it is this may also

07:48.320 --> 07:51.000
 be a good financial decision to take this risk?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.240
 Yeah, I think about it all the time.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.880
 And I know very well that if you focus too much on making money,

07:56.880 --> 07:58.440
 you will never make.

07:58.440 --> 08:02.760
 You should focus in what is the real value driver.

08:02.760 --> 08:07.080
 And the real value driver, it is to make breakthroughs

08:07.080 --> 08:08.880
 that change patients lives.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.360
 If you don't do that, you will never make money.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.320
 If you do that, don't worry.

08:13.320 --> 08:16.440
 Things will fall into place, and also money will follow.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.600
 But the mentality of the company is

08:18.600 --> 08:19.920
 to be how to help the patient.

08:19.920 --> 08:23.160
 And that's what the management was that the shareholders want,

08:23.160 --> 08:26.360
 because that's the only way that we can create value.

08:26.360 --> 08:28.240
 In this particular case, we're not

08:28.240 --> 08:31.120
 thinking at all about what are we

08:31.120 --> 08:34.760
 going to make when we sell it or if we don't sell it.

08:34.760 --> 08:37.680
 Because what we were focusing 100%

08:37.680 --> 08:40.520
 was how to bring a solution to the world that

08:40.520 --> 08:44.400
 will help all of us change the fear that

08:44.400 --> 08:46.440
 was bringing hope to the world.

08:46.440 --> 08:49.760
 And as always, when you do that, you

08:49.760 --> 08:53.400
 will have good returns as well.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.840
 On a philosophical level, on a human level,

08:55.840 --> 08:58.520
 do you ever worry that the pressure

08:58.520 --> 09:01.400
 to cover the costs that were invested,

09:01.400 --> 09:05.080
 to develop a new drug, to develop this vaccine,

09:05.080 --> 09:08.560
 harms your ability to conduct unbiased studies?

09:08.560 --> 09:12.840
 Not at all, because the studies are highly regulated.

09:12.840 --> 09:15.720
 Everybody knows what regulators, and when

09:15.720 --> 09:20.560
 I say regulators, FDA, European authorities, UK authorities,

09:20.560 --> 09:22.800
 Israeli authorities, Japanese authorities, Canadian

09:22.800 --> 09:27.360
 authorities, want to see how the study needs to be conducted

09:27.360 --> 09:30.200
 and what exactly they need to see to approve it or not.

09:30.200 --> 09:34.400
 So clearly, everybody takes into consideration

09:34.400 --> 09:35.840
 how much money I'm going to invest

09:35.840 --> 09:38.960
 and what is the chances that I'm going to lose them.

09:38.960 --> 09:42.680
 But what you can do is to change the rules of the game

09:42.680 --> 09:44.680
 so that you won't lose the money.

09:44.680 --> 09:47.960
 There are very well established methodologies

09:47.960 --> 09:50.960
 that would say with very high precision

09:50.960 --> 09:54.800
 if your medicine is effective, if your medicine is safe.

09:54.800 --> 09:57.320
 And those are there for all and are

09:57.320 --> 09:59.720
 playing with the same rules.

09:59.720 --> 10:02.000
 Do you have an intuition about why

10:02.000 --> 10:07.480
 is the FDA trying to get 75 years to release the Pfizer

10:07.480 --> 10:08.040
 data?

10:08.040 --> 10:10.160
 They're trying to request that it will not

10:10.160 --> 10:12.400
 be released for 75 years.

10:12.400 --> 10:16.120
 And then maybe the broader version of that question

10:16.120 --> 10:18.720
 is do you think people should have

10:18.720 --> 10:22.760
 sort of full transparency and immediate access to the data,

10:22.760 --> 10:27.240
 immediate on the scale of weeks, not years?

10:27.240 --> 10:30.240
 I think the relations with regulators,

10:30.240 --> 10:32.120
 they have been always very transparent.

10:32.120 --> 10:35.320
 And there are a lot of laws that they

10:35.320 --> 10:40.320
 are forcing regulators and companies

10:40.320 --> 10:44.720
 to put out their interactions and what exactly was discussed.

10:44.720 --> 10:50.000
 Now, to go into specific details of some discussions,

10:50.000 --> 10:52.120
 I don't know what is the reason that FDA

10:52.120 --> 10:53.680
 wants to take the time.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.760
 And I'm sure they have very good reasons.

10:56.760 --> 10:59.760
 Well, let me just say my side of it.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.720
 It doesn't look like a good reason.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.920
 It looks like maybe it's because I come from the Soviet Union.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.880
 Now, this is not you saying this.

11:06.880 --> 11:10.200
 This is me saying this.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.880
 There seems to be a bureaucracy that

11:11.880 --> 11:13.400
 gets in the way of transparency.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.280
 That's always the challenge with government.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.960
 So government is very good at setting rules and making

11:17.960 --> 11:21.360
 sure there's oversight of companies and people and so on.

11:21.360 --> 11:24.120
 But they create, they slow things down,

11:24.120 --> 11:26.240
 which is a feature and a bug.

11:26.240 --> 11:29.120
 And in this case, they slow down so much.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.680
 I think the reason they set it at 75 years

11:31.680 --> 11:34.440
 is because they set a rate of being

11:34.440 --> 11:37.360
 able to only review 500 pages of data a day

11:37.360 --> 11:38.640
 or something like that.

11:38.640 --> 11:41.360
 And that's a very kind of bureaucratic thing,

11:41.360 --> 11:44.840
 where in reality, you could just show the data.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.480
 And it's not like something is being hidden.

11:47.480 --> 11:50.200
 But in the battle to win people's trust,

11:50.200 --> 11:52.240
 to inspire them with science, it feels

11:52.240 --> 11:55.080
 like transparency is one of the most beautiful things, one

11:55.080 --> 11:57.640
 of the most powerful things that the FDA has.

11:57.640 --> 12:01.320
 FDA has the potential to be one of the great institutions

12:01.320 --> 12:02.400
 of our country.

12:02.400 --> 12:06.600
 And this is one example that it feels, to me, like a failure.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.440
 So in your perspective, you're saying,

12:08.440 --> 12:10.200
 I'm sure they have a good reason.

12:10.200 --> 12:13.360
 So to you, the FDA is this black box

12:13.360 --> 12:17.400
 that you submit things to once they approve.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.080
 You know that those are the rules.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.120
 It's approved.

12:21.120 --> 12:21.880
 That's it.

12:21.880 --> 12:24.360
 But this is not a black box.

12:24.360 --> 12:28.080
 We know very well what is the process.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.920
 Everybody knows very well what are the processes.

12:30.920 --> 12:35.720
 The review process also, it is very detailed.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.320
 They have scientists of very, very high caliber.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.360
 Not every regulator in the world,

12:40.360 --> 12:45.000
 but the Europeans, the BRIDs, the FDA clearly,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.080
 they have very, very high caliber of scientists

12:47.080 --> 12:50.040
 that they are going into a lot of details.

12:50.040 --> 12:55.040
 And also, basically everything for a study

12:55.520 --> 13:00.040
 is really released by law in the specifications

13:00.040 --> 13:02.560
 of the product, but it's a very detailed document

13:02.560 --> 13:05.280
 that it is issued and has basically the essence

13:05.280 --> 13:06.840
 of everything that was discussed.

13:06.840 --> 13:10.520
 I don't know about specific documents

13:10.520 --> 13:12.440
 if take them time to release,

13:12.440 --> 13:15.960
 but clearly this is not a black box type of process.

13:15.960 --> 13:19.120
 A lot of this stuff is how do you effectively communicate

13:19.120 --> 13:22.520
 to the world about the incredible science that's been done,

13:22.520 --> 13:24.640
 about the processes that were followed.

13:24.640 --> 13:25.640
 I agree with you.

13:25.640 --> 13:29.520
 And then sometimes it's just in eloquence in communication.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.360
 It's not that there's a failure process.

13:31.360 --> 13:34.400
 It's in eloquence of communication and silence.

13:34.400 --> 13:37.120
 Silence in the moment when clearly a lot of people

13:37.120 --> 13:40.120
 are bothered and have questions.

13:40.120 --> 13:44.720
 This is when you speak out and you explain exactly why

13:44.720 --> 13:48.960
 as opposed to letting the sort of distrust build up

13:48.960 --> 13:51.800
 and linger because the result is there's a very large

13:51.800 --> 13:54.140
 percentage of the population that just,

13:56.340 --> 14:01.260
 I mean, it divides people and science suffers, I think.

14:01.260 --> 14:04.700
 And also the effectiveness of solutions suffers

14:04.700 --> 14:06.440
 like the vaccine and so on.

14:08.560 --> 14:10.480
 I asked a few folks I know

14:10.480 --> 14:12.680
 if they had challenging questions for you.

14:12.680 --> 14:17.120
 I'm sure many of them answered your call.

14:17.120 --> 14:21.160
 Yeah, many friendly folks out there.

14:21.160 --> 14:24.800
 By the way, I'm sweating not because this is a difficult

14:24.800 --> 14:27.020
 conversation, it is, but it's also hot in here

14:27.020 --> 14:27.860
 for the record.

14:29.600 --> 14:33.160
 So one of the folks is Mr. Jordan Peterson.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.400
 I don't know if you know who that is.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.280
 He's a psychologist and intellectual and author.

14:38.280 --> 14:40.760
 He suggested to me that I raised the concern

14:40.760 --> 14:42.740
 that there's a close working relationship

14:42.740 --> 14:45.720
 between Pfizer, FDA, and CDC.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.640
 So we talked about FDA.

14:48.840 --> 14:52.680
 Do you worry that this affects both positive and negative

14:53.560 --> 14:56.560
 Pfizer's chances of getting drugs approved?

14:56.560 --> 14:59.480
 The fact that there's people that worked at the FDA

14:59.480 --> 15:01.780
 that now work at Pfizer, Pfizer, FDA,

15:01.780 --> 15:04.080
 that there's a kind of pipeline.

15:04.080 --> 15:08.560
 Does this worry you that it affects your ability

15:08.560 --> 15:11.760
 to do great, unbiased work?

15:11.760 --> 15:16.600
 I have zero doubts that this is not affecting at all

15:16.600 --> 15:21.100
 their ability to be unbiased and regulate.

15:21.100 --> 15:24.200
 And in order to, for the system also reinforces that

15:24.200 --> 15:27.840
 by creating significant time barriers.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.760
 If someone moves from an industry to FDA,

15:30.760 --> 15:34.600
 she won't be able to deal with topics for a period of time.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.480
 And then for even an enhanced period of time

15:36.480 --> 15:38.480
 with topics that are related with a company

15:38.480 --> 15:40.840
 he or she may come from.

15:40.840 --> 15:45.840
 I think these regulators, they are really very strict.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.360
 Rightly so.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.240
 If anything, I feel sometimes that maybe they should

15:52.160 --> 15:55.000
 be a little bit more open minded,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.400
 particularly when it comes to new technologies,

15:57.400 --> 16:00.880
 rather than trying to judge and implement the same

16:00.880 --> 16:03.520
 framework of variation of new technologies to all.

16:03.520 --> 16:07.280
 They are always as regulators in the conservative side.

16:07.280 --> 16:11.640
 But always, always, they are unbiased

16:11.640 --> 16:13.680
 and they are trying the best.

16:13.680 --> 16:15.960
 And it's not only one or two people.

16:15.960 --> 16:19.080
 They have processes to make sure that there are self checks

16:19.080 --> 16:21.320
 and balances within the agencies,

16:21.320 --> 16:23.840
 both in CDC and in the FDA.

16:23.840 --> 16:26.520
 Difficult decisions, they bring external experts

16:26.520 --> 16:27.900
 that they should express.

16:27.900 --> 16:30.080
 Easy decisions, they are internal experts

16:30.080 --> 16:31.300
 that they are debating a lot.

16:31.300 --> 16:33.520
 And if there are disagreements, they elevate them.

16:33.520 --> 16:38.520
 So I think we are lucky to have good regulators.

16:39.100 --> 16:42.560
 I think I agree with what you said before,

16:42.560 --> 16:46.540
 as with all governmental agencies, there is bureaucracy.

16:46.540 --> 16:49.760
 And the bureaucracy needs to be addressed.

16:49.760 --> 16:54.640
 And by saying bureaucracy is not relaxing the bar.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.640
 The bar needs to remain high.

16:56.640 --> 17:01.640
 But focusing on what matters rather than on the detail.

17:04.440 --> 17:08.960
 So you don't, I've been reading quite a bit about history.

17:08.960 --> 17:12.240
 You don't worry about human nature and corruption

17:12.240 --> 17:13.480
 that can seep in.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.120
 You're saying institutionally,

17:15.120 --> 17:16.840
 there's protections against this.

17:16.840 --> 17:21.240
 I think there is always the fear of corruption,

17:21.240 --> 17:24.060
 particularly when you speak about public servants.

17:24.060 --> 17:28.680
 But clearly the risk is very different country by country.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.960
 And speaking about agencies by agencies,

17:31.960 --> 17:34.400
 I think the regulatory agencies

17:34.400 --> 17:37.020
 have a very good track record in history

17:37.020 --> 17:40.040
 of the US, of Europe, of England,

17:40.040 --> 17:43.200
 of very, very good track record of integrity.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.240
 It's something I think about.

17:46.240 --> 17:47.900
 So I grew up in the Soviet Union

17:47.900 --> 17:52.900
 and I need to perhaps introspect this a little bit.

17:52.900 --> 17:56.900
 But when I was growing up, ethically,

17:56.900 --> 17:59.500
 there was a sense that bribery

17:59.500 --> 18:01.640
 is the only way you can get stuff done.

18:01.640 --> 18:04.020
 That was the system of the time.

18:04.020 --> 18:06.740
 Like you get pulled over by a police officer.

18:06.740 --> 18:09.140
 Like obviously you need to bribe them.

18:09.140 --> 18:11.460
 I mean, it was like the way of life.

18:11.460 --> 18:14.460
 And then so coming to this country was beautiful

18:14.460 --> 18:16.980
 to see that the rule of law has so much power.

18:16.980 --> 18:21.820
 And ultimately the rule of law when enacted,

18:21.820 --> 18:26.660
 when it holds up, it gives people freedom

18:26.660 --> 18:28.540
 to do the best work of their lives.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.660
 But there's still human nature.

18:30.660 --> 18:32.300
 And that worries me a lot here.

18:32.300 --> 18:34.480
 And again, it goes back to the perception,

18:34.480 --> 18:36.780
 the communication, when there's people

18:36.780 --> 18:41.780
 that have worked at Pfizer and an FDA, at the CDC,

18:41.860 --> 18:42.940
 you look at their resume,

18:42.940 --> 18:46.700
 they have those things on their resume, it worries people.

18:46.700 --> 18:50.100
 Are these great leaders that we are supposed

18:50.100 --> 18:54.620
 to see as authorities, are they playing a game on us?

18:54.620 --> 18:58.260
 I would say that I recognize what you said

18:58.260 --> 19:00.540
 about what happened in, or what,

19:00.540 --> 19:02.700
 I'm sure that what you described

19:02.700 --> 19:05.300
 in the country that you're coming from,

19:05.300 --> 19:07.620
 it was how you experienced it.

19:07.620 --> 19:09.300
 And I know that there are other countries

19:09.300 --> 19:13.300
 that you need to do these things to do your job.

19:13.300 --> 19:17.800
 I don't think it's the case in this country,

19:17.800 --> 19:19.620
 particularly when it comes to those agencies

19:19.620 --> 19:20.860
 that you mentioned.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.780
 I think they have a very high track record.

19:23.780 --> 19:26.700
 And also, I don't think that there are a lot of people

19:26.700 --> 19:29.020
 that they are worried about it or doubt it.

19:29.020 --> 19:31.900
 I'm sure, like everywhere, there will be a minority,

19:31.900 --> 19:34.180
 but the vast majority of the Americans,

19:34.180 --> 19:35.620
 the vast majority of the Europeans,

19:35.620 --> 19:37.300
 the vast majority of the Brits,

19:37.300 --> 19:39.380
 the vast majority of the Israelis,

19:39.380 --> 19:44.380
 they trust what FDA or EMA or CDC or MHRA will say.

19:44.380 --> 19:46.260
 MHRA will say.

19:48.100 --> 19:50.060
 Still, there's currently a distrust

19:50.060 --> 19:51.620
 of big pharma in the public.

19:51.620 --> 19:54.420
 Maybe this is something I'd love to hear your comment on.

19:55.700 --> 19:57.980
 There's distrust of science when it's tangled up

19:57.980 --> 20:00.240
 with corporations and government institutions,

20:00.240 --> 20:01.440
 like we've talked about.

20:02.580 --> 20:06.380
 But they have to be entangled to achieve scale,

20:07.220 --> 20:09.340
 oversight, and to achieve the kind of scale

20:09.340 --> 20:11.340
 that Pfizer's been able to accomplish.

20:11.340 --> 20:16.340
 So, how can Pfizer regain the public trust?

20:16.660 --> 20:19.060
 How can you regain the public trust, do you think?

20:19.060 --> 20:21.820
 Not regain, but sort of take steps

20:21.820 --> 20:24.340
 to increase the public trust.

20:24.340 --> 20:29.340
 Reputation is something that you can lose in buckets,

20:29.860 --> 20:31.780
 but you can earn it back in drops.

20:32.660 --> 20:36.100
 And once you've lost it,

20:36.100 --> 20:40.380
 you are going to take a lot of effort to bring it back.

20:40.380 --> 20:42.500
 And the pharmaceutical industry lost it.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.380
 It's clear that the reputation of the industry

20:45.380 --> 20:50.060
 in the last decade was on the lowest

20:50.060 --> 20:52.500
 that we have seen ever.

20:52.500 --> 20:56.740
 And there are many reasons for that,

20:56.740 --> 20:59.540
 but clearly there are reasons that are related also

20:59.540 --> 21:01.980
 with the behavior of the industry.

21:01.980 --> 21:04.740
 That needed to change, and I'm hopeful

21:04.740 --> 21:08.340
 that very few will disagree

21:08.340 --> 21:11.180
 that the industry is a very different industry right now.

21:12.340 --> 21:16.260
 That being said, I truly believe

21:16.260 --> 21:20.860
 that if there is one lesson that stands out

21:20.860 --> 21:23.940
 from the many lessons that we learned during COVID,

21:23.940 --> 21:27.500
 is the power of science in the hands of the private sector.

21:29.060 --> 21:32.420
 I think it was the private sector

21:32.420 --> 21:36.420
 that came with solutions with diagnostic tests

21:36.420 --> 21:39.900
 when we didn't have, solutions with respirators

21:39.900 --> 21:43.340
 when we didn't have, solutions with treatments,

21:43.340 --> 21:44.580
 solutions with vaccines.

21:45.500 --> 21:50.500
 And I think that demonstrated very clearly to the world

21:50.740 --> 21:55.740
 the value of thriving life sciences sector,

21:56.860 --> 21:59.060
 private life sciences sector to society.

22:00.420 --> 22:04.540
 That also affected very positively the reputation,

22:04.540 --> 22:06.980
 both of the sector and of Pfizer.

22:08.140 --> 22:11.500
 I'm not going to make the mistake to consider given.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.380
 I'm not going to make the mistake

22:13.380 --> 22:17.660
 that because our reputation is high, that will remain so.

22:17.660 --> 22:19.940
 We need to earn it every day.

22:19.940 --> 22:22.140
 Every day with everything we do,

22:22.140 --> 22:25.060
 with everything we say, with the way we behave.

22:25.060 --> 22:28.100
 And I hope that we'll rise to this occasion

22:28.100 --> 22:29.100
 and we will do that.

22:30.060 --> 22:32.380
 You've been at Pfizer for 28 years.

22:32.380 --> 22:33.780
 Time flies when you're having fun.

22:33.780 --> 22:37.700
 And you've become CEO in 2019.

22:37.700 --> 22:41.940
 It is a company you love, a company you believe in.

22:41.940 --> 22:43.620
 It's a company that has developed drugs

22:43.620 --> 22:46.220
 that has helped millions of people.

22:46.220 --> 22:48.740
 So let me ask yet another hard question

22:50.060 --> 22:51.740
 on this topic of reputation.

22:51.740 --> 22:54.180
 In 2009, Pfizer pleaded guilty

22:54.180 --> 22:57.620
 to the illegal marketing of arthritis drug Bextra

22:57.620 --> 23:01.420
 and agreed to a $2.3 billion settlement.

23:01.420 --> 23:04.860
 How do you make sense of the fact that this happened

23:04.860 --> 23:07.900
 to a company you love and that you believe in?

23:07.900 --> 23:12.300
 Yes, the Bextra case in 2009

23:12.300 --> 23:15.380
 was related to things that happened in 2003.

23:16.340 --> 23:17.980
 And the things that happened in 2003

23:17.980 --> 23:21.620
 were things that basically several of our reps

23:21.620 --> 23:24.180
 did off label promotion.

23:24.180 --> 23:27.300
 So they spoke with the physicians

23:27.300 --> 23:31.300
 about off label use of the product, and they shouldn't.

23:31.300 --> 23:32.660
 Can you clarify it?

23:32.660 --> 23:35.700
 So off label are things that the FDA didn't approve,

23:35.700 --> 23:37.060
 extra stuff.

23:37.060 --> 23:39.380
 You basically say this drug does extra stuff

23:39.380 --> 23:40.820
 that the FDA never approved.

23:40.820 --> 23:43.420
 Correct, and this is something that it is allowed

23:43.420 --> 23:45.420
 when physicians are speaking to physicians,

23:45.420 --> 23:48.140
 but it is not allowed for the pharmaceutical companies

23:48.140 --> 23:50.300
 to refer to these studies,

23:50.300 --> 23:53.100
 because usually our studies that are happening off label.

23:53.100 --> 23:57.460
 And apparently several of our reps in 2003, they did it.

23:57.460 --> 24:02.460
 And we had to settle in 2009,

24:02.580 --> 24:05.220
 and we paid a very big fine, as you said.

24:05.220 --> 24:08.580
 The fine was related not to the severity of the conduct,

24:08.580 --> 24:10.300
 but the size of the revenues.

24:10.300 --> 24:13.420
 So the fines are, if Bextra was a small product,

24:13.420 --> 24:14.500
 we would get a small fine.

24:14.500 --> 24:15.980
 Bextra was a very big product,

24:15.980 --> 24:17.740
 and we got a very large fine.

24:17.740 --> 24:20.700
 Very bad, what happened in 2003.

24:21.580 --> 24:26.580
 I don't think that these things happened since then.

24:26.580 --> 24:29.980
 We have a stellar record from 2009 until now

24:29.980 --> 24:34.980
 of complying with every single regulation and rule.

24:34.980 --> 24:37.420
 We have internal processes to make sure

24:37.420 --> 24:39.660
 that these are not happening by individuals

24:39.660 --> 24:41.900
 that may have an interest.

24:41.900 --> 24:43.660
 For example, to get a promotion,

24:43.660 --> 24:45.300
 they may try and do things

24:45.300 --> 24:47.140
 that are not the right things.

24:47.140 --> 24:52.140
 And we have, more importantly, a culture in this company

24:52.540 --> 24:56.460
 that really sets aside people that they think differently.

24:56.460 --> 25:00.140
 So I didn't like what happened in 2003,

25:01.700 --> 25:03.660
 but I believe a lot has changed

25:03.660 --> 25:06.740
 in the 20 years that followed, or almost 20 years.

25:07.620 --> 25:09.500
 So you're developing drugs,

25:09.500 --> 25:12.460
 you're developing solutions to help millions of people,

25:12.460 --> 25:13.860
 but there's risk involved.

25:14.740 --> 25:18.940
 And so there will be lawsuits heading back your way

25:18.940 --> 25:23.940
 because there's a lot of lawyers in the world, partially.

25:27.540 --> 25:29.900
 How do you put that into the calculation

25:29.900 --> 25:32.900
 of how you try to do good in the world?

25:35.740 --> 25:38.180
 That some of the cost is the lawsuits.

25:38.180 --> 25:41.980
 How do you not fall victim to thinking

25:41.980 --> 25:44.660
 that it's just the cost of doing business,

25:44.660 --> 25:46.980
 and that some of the lawsuits might actually represent

25:46.980 --> 25:49.780
 real pain that people are going through?

25:49.780 --> 25:52.500
 No, I think that we try always to do the right thing.

25:52.500 --> 25:56.860
 And that's, as I said, very well embedded into our culture.

25:56.860 --> 25:59.100
 If you don't do the right thing,

25:59.100 --> 26:03.140
 sooner or later, you will pay for it, one way or another.

26:03.140 --> 26:05.380
 And right now, for us doing the right thing,

26:05.380 --> 26:09.980
 it is being able to find innovations to issues

26:09.980 --> 26:14.740
 that are real, diseases that they do not have

26:14.740 --> 26:17.860
 good coverage, good treatments right now.

26:17.860 --> 26:20.340
 We try to find treatments that significantly

26:21.420 --> 26:24.980
 surpass the current standards of care.

26:26.020 --> 26:29.460
 And we try not only to comply with what regulators

26:29.460 --> 26:31.420
 are asking us to do, this is what you need to do

26:31.420 --> 26:34.900
 to prove the safety or the efficacy, but exceed them.

26:34.900 --> 26:37.380
 No matter what we do on that,

26:37.380 --> 26:39.540
 I'm sure that people will find opportunity

26:39.540 --> 26:42.740
 because, as you said, there are a lot of lawyers to sue us.

26:42.740 --> 26:44.460
 But we believe in the justice system

26:44.460 --> 26:47.540
 and we believe that eventually,

26:47.540 --> 26:49.820
 if you are doing the right thing,

26:49.820 --> 26:53.140
 you will be on the right side of the history.

26:53.140 --> 26:55.060
 I'm really glad you say that because

26:57.900 --> 27:01.020
 focusing on doing the right thing, no matter the money,

27:01.020 --> 27:03.820
 I believe is the best way to make money.

27:03.820 --> 27:04.900
 That's exactly what I said.

27:04.900 --> 27:08.620
 And also, in another way, in other realms,

27:08.620 --> 27:10.180
 creating a product that people love

27:10.180 --> 27:11.780
 is the best way to make money.

27:11.780 --> 27:15.180
 So focusing on the core of the thing

27:15.180 --> 27:16.700
 that makes people feel good,

27:16.700 --> 27:18.500
 that brings value to people's lives.

27:19.700 --> 27:22.220
 So I'm now in Austin, Texas.

27:23.340 --> 27:27.220
 My good friend, Joe Rogan, he's been highlighting to me

27:27.220 --> 27:31.100
 this aggressive marketing on mainstream media channels

27:31.100 --> 27:32.340
 by Pfizer.

27:32.340 --> 27:35.340
 So let me ask a general marketing question.

27:35.340 --> 27:37.420
 Do you see this as a conflict of interest?

27:37.420 --> 27:40.580
 Is it my bias, the reporting of news?

27:40.580 --> 27:44.340
 That a lot of us, a lot of people, me included,

27:44.340 --> 27:47.900
 look to these mainstream channels of news

27:47.900 --> 27:49.300
 for kind of authority of like,

27:49.300 --> 27:51.580
 what the heck's going on in the world?

27:51.580 --> 27:54.420
 And if Pfizer is sponsoring

27:56.940 --> 27:58.740
 many of these shows,

28:00.260 --> 28:03.420
 there's a worry, it may be a perception thing,

28:03.420 --> 28:05.060
 but there's also a natural worry

28:05.060 --> 28:07.180
 that it would influence what they're talking about

28:07.180 --> 28:09.020
 because they're afraid of losing the sponsorship.

28:09.020 --> 28:12.940
 It's subtle, but at scale, it might have a serious impact.

28:12.940 --> 28:14.980
 Do you worry about this?

28:14.980 --> 28:17.980
 I think people could go one way or another

28:17.980 --> 28:21.380
 because of multiple reasons.

28:21.380 --> 28:23.020
 From our perspective,

28:24.620 --> 28:28.820
 I don't think we have aggressive marketing.

28:28.820 --> 28:31.180
 What we do, we go on TV

28:31.180 --> 28:35.140
 and we are having ads about our products

28:35.140 --> 28:38.300
 and they're highly regulated.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.900
 I think it is the right of people to know,

28:40.900 --> 28:43.740
 to learn that if there is a product like that.

28:43.740 --> 28:47.260
 It's very clearly that we cannot say things

28:47.260 --> 28:49.620
 that they are off label, that have not been approved.

28:49.620 --> 28:52.580
 We need to have, every time we go on TV, as you know,

28:52.580 --> 28:55.740
 FDA is forcing us to say also the bad things

28:55.740 --> 28:57.380
 that can happen for a medicine.

28:57.380 --> 29:01.340
 Sometimes that takes more time than the good things.

29:01.340 --> 29:04.660
 And I don't think that we are doing aggressive marketing.

29:04.660 --> 29:08.420
 Now, people could be influenced

29:08.420 --> 29:10.700
 and can be biased in the podcasts

29:10.700 --> 29:14.340
 or the other type of media activities that they have

29:14.340 --> 29:17.460
 for multiple different reasons.

29:17.460 --> 29:19.980
 Yeah, I know, but it's still, it's pressure.

29:19.980 --> 29:20.820
 It's human nature.

29:20.820 --> 29:24.460
 I mean, one of it is perception, but I worry about too.

29:24.460 --> 29:26.540
 I think I have a ton of sponsors for this podcast,

29:26.540 --> 29:30.340
 for example, and none of them ever asked me to anything.

29:30.340 --> 29:31.820
 They're just, you know,

29:31.820 --> 29:34.900
 I think likely that kind of pressure's not happening

29:34.900 --> 29:39.460
 for Pfizer, but there's implied pressure sometimes.

29:39.460 --> 29:43.140
 And I worry about that a lot because, you know,

29:43.140 --> 29:48.140
 I look at academia, like I look for the good in people.

29:48.380 --> 29:50.180
 I tend to believe most people are good

29:50.180 --> 29:54.780
 or have the capacity to be good and desire to be good.

29:54.780 --> 30:01.780
 When I came to MIT, I was a little bit disappointed,

30:01.860 --> 30:03.220
 maybe heartbroken.

30:05.860 --> 30:07.220
 How much pressure?

30:09.820 --> 30:12.700
 I think unjustified pressure people felt

30:12.700 --> 30:16.060
 from financial constraints, especially at MIT

30:16.060 --> 30:17.940
 when there's, I think, a lot of money.

30:19.260 --> 30:22.700
 People still felt constraints and they weren't,

30:22.700 --> 30:24.500
 it wasn't bringing out the best in them.

30:24.500 --> 30:25.660
 They weren't supporting each other.

30:25.660 --> 30:26.940
 They weren't loving each other,

30:26.940 --> 30:30.060
 like celebrating each other's successes.

30:30.060 --> 30:32.020
 I don't want to blame money on everything,

30:32.020 --> 30:35.460
 money constraints, but when you have sponsors,

30:35.460 --> 30:38.180
 it just, I personally worry

30:38.180 --> 30:41.380
 that it doesn't bring the best out of people.

30:41.380 --> 30:44.820
 And so I feel like I want to put some responsibility

30:44.820 --> 30:49.460
 on sponsors and great big companies like Pfizer

30:49.460 --> 30:54.460
 to kind of not get in the way of the best of human nature,

30:56.700 --> 31:01.700
 whether it's sponsoring podcasts, mainstream media,

31:02.020 --> 31:05.140
 like, I don't know, athletes, whatever.

31:05.140 --> 31:08.020
 You need to know that we are so, so careful

31:08.020 --> 31:09.220
 with sponsorships.

31:09.220 --> 31:12.100
 First of all, we have very few, very, very few.

31:12.100 --> 31:14.660
 We have a team that for every single one,

31:14.660 --> 31:16.820
 could be $2,000.

31:16.820 --> 31:19.260
 They will try to see if there is a conflict of interest

31:19.260 --> 31:20.420
 in the way we do it.

31:20.420 --> 31:25.420
 And also what is the reputation of the persons

31:25.420 --> 31:27.860
 or the programs that we are sponsoring?

31:27.860 --> 31:32.540
 So I don't think, our friend, I think was from Texas.

31:32.540 --> 31:33.460
 Yes. Yeah.

31:33.460 --> 31:34.900
 I don't. Joe Rogan, yes.

31:34.900 --> 31:35.740
 Yes.

31:35.740 --> 31:37.780
 I don't think he got it right

31:37.780 --> 31:40.380
 that we do those type of things.

31:41.340 --> 31:42.180
 We don't.

31:42.180 --> 31:44.620
 Oh, in terms of like having a negative effect on.

31:44.620 --> 31:46.580
 Not even having aggressive sponsorships.

31:46.580 --> 31:48.060
 We have very few.

31:48.060 --> 31:49.900
 Yeah, when you clip them all together.

31:49.900 --> 31:51.460
 And most of the sponsorships that we have,

31:51.460 --> 31:55.340
 it is more on patient related organizations

31:55.340 --> 31:58.860
 rather than we are very careful not to sponsor other things

31:58.860 --> 32:02.300
 that can be perceived, not even influenced,

32:02.300 --> 32:03.740
 but perceived that we may influence.

32:03.740 --> 32:05.340
 So we are very, very careful on that.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.460
 This is not the case with us.

32:07.460 --> 32:11.920
 So with the incredibly fast development of the vaccine,

32:13.340 --> 32:16.820
 could you tell me the story from the engineering

32:16.820 --> 32:19.300
 to the science, to the human story

32:19.300 --> 32:21.820
 of how you could do it so fast?

32:22.680 --> 32:26.380
 By November, you even had the ambition to do it by October.

32:26.380 --> 32:28.540
 It was in the initial days.

32:28.540 --> 32:31.140
 How do you. Eight days later.

32:31.140 --> 32:33.500
 In that time, how do you show

32:33.500 --> 32:35.660
 that the vaccine is safe and effective

32:36.860 --> 32:38.820
 given that I think previous vaccines

32:38.820 --> 32:40.260
 have taken years to do that?

32:40.260 --> 32:43.220
 Yeah, the vaccines take years to do that.

32:43.220 --> 32:47.660
 And the time that it takes, it is basically

32:48.900 --> 32:50.980
 the vast majority of the time to conduct

32:50.980 --> 32:53.180
 the final phase three study,

32:53.180 --> 32:55.460
 that is the confirmatory study.

32:55.460 --> 32:57.140
 And you do that because the phase three study

32:57.140 --> 33:00.660
 costs a lot of money, in our case, cost almost a billion.

33:00.660 --> 33:03.780
 So you don't want to go and risk a billion

33:03.780 --> 33:08.700
 in blinded data normally before you do a lot of experiments

33:08.700 --> 33:10.900
 to make sure that the product that you're putting

33:10.900 --> 33:13.540
 in the phase three is the right one.

33:13.540 --> 33:15.060
 We didn't have that time.

33:15.060 --> 33:17.500
 So we risked all the money.

33:17.500 --> 33:21.740
 So we went into, we condensed all the time

33:21.740 --> 33:23.100
 towards this phase three.

33:23.100 --> 33:27.140
 But the phase three study had to follow all the rules

33:27.140 --> 33:31.580
 that any study follows when we do this trial.

33:31.580 --> 33:34.820
 Could you just briefly describe the basics

33:34.820 --> 33:37.860
 of what is phase one, what is phase two, what is phase three?

33:37.860 --> 33:39.940
 Let's say that there are so many phases

33:39.940 --> 33:42.500
 when you try first of all to find

33:42.500 --> 33:43.620
 what is the right vaccine.

33:43.620 --> 33:45.980
 We tried from 20 different vaccines,

33:45.980 --> 33:47.740
 we nailed down to four.

33:47.740 --> 33:50.380
 And for those four, we selected eventually two

33:50.380 --> 33:52.340
 and then eventually one.

33:52.340 --> 33:55.380
 Once you have those selections,

33:55.380 --> 33:57.140
 what is the dose you're going to use?

33:57.140 --> 33:59.980
 And then we tried multiple different doses

33:59.980 --> 34:02.460
 to see which one we think is the best.

34:02.460 --> 34:05.180
 What does trying entail in those early days?

34:05.180 --> 34:10.180
 You go first of all with smaller doses in humans.

34:11.380 --> 34:13.980
 And then after you have done a lot of experiments

34:13.980 --> 34:17.340
 in animals so that you can feel that it is safe enough

34:17.340 --> 34:20.500
 to go to humans and then go with very low dose.

34:20.500 --> 34:22.180
 And then you gradually increase the dose

34:22.180 --> 34:24.820
 and then you monitor those humans to make sure

34:24.820 --> 34:28.340
 that there are not any, let's say reactogenicity

34:28.340 --> 34:29.740
 to what you are giving them.

34:29.740 --> 34:32.060
 At the same time, you start to measure what it's doing

34:32.060 --> 34:34.500
 in terms of immune responses.

34:34.500 --> 34:36.140
 So you do that with multiple vaccines

34:36.140 --> 34:37.780
 and you do that with multiple doses

34:37.780 --> 34:40.540
 and you do that with multiple ages of people,

34:40.540 --> 34:42.500
 young people, old people.

34:42.500 --> 34:47.060
 And eventually from the 20 vaccines to multiple doses,

34:47.060 --> 34:49.980
 to multiple schedules, is it after three weeks

34:49.980 --> 34:51.980
 the second dose or is it after four weeks

34:51.980 --> 34:53.820
 or after six months?

34:53.820 --> 34:58.820
 All of that will inform you that I think this is the vaccine,

34:59.620 --> 35:02.420
 this is the dose, this is the scheme

35:02.420 --> 35:05.540
 that I believe will give me the best results.

35:05.540 --> 35:06.540
 And when you have that,

35:06.540 --> 35:09.900
 then you go to do what we call the phase three.

35:09.900 --> 35:14.180
 This is a very big study with thousands of people

35:14.180 --> 35:17.420
 where you use the vaccine that you think is the right one

35:17.420 --> 35:19.660
 and a placebo.

35:19.660 --> 35:22.540
 The placebo and the vaccine, they look identical.

35:22.540 --> 35:26.620
 Nobody knows if is injected a placebo or a vaccine.

35:26.620 --> 35:29.220
 The physician that makes the injection,

35:29.220 --> 35:32.300
 the doctor doesn't know if he's injecting placebo

35:32.300 --> 35:35.380
 or vaccine, he knows a barcode.

35:35.380 --> 35:36.540
 Only the computer knows.

35:37.420 --> 35:39.900
 In order to go into this computer, there are keys

35:39.900 --> 35:41.420
 and there are at least two people

35:41.420 --> 35:42.860
 that needs to put their keys

35:42.860 --> 35:44.980
 so that someone can see the data.

35:44.980 --> 35:48.380
 And those people, they have legal obligations

35:48.380 --> 35:49.900
 never to do that, right?

35:49.900 --> 35:52.260
 So before a certain point.

35:52.260 --> 35:53.980
 So all of that is blind.

35:53.980 --> 35:58.260
 The idea is that when you go into this study,

35:58.260 --> 36:00.700
 you need to make sure that you are going with the right one.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.820
 That's why it takes so much time.

36:02.820 --> 36:04.460
 But the study is the study.

36:04.460 --> 36:07.380
 You need to have a significant number of people

36:07.380 --> 36:09.140
 that will give the two

36:09.140 --> 36:10.980
 and then you let them live their lives.

36:10.980 --> 36:13.460
 And then you see how many of them will get the disease.

36:13.460 --> 36:16.140
 And then you see if there are differences

36:16.140 --> 36:19.100
 in percentage of infections for the vaccinated

36:19.100 --> 36:20.540
 compared to the non vaccinated.

36:20.540 --> 36:22.500
 At the same time, you're monitoring all of them

36:22.500 --> 36:25.260
 to see if there are differences in the safety profile.

36:25.260 --> 36:27.220
 If those that go to placebo have the same,

36:27.220 --> 36:31.020
 let's say, heart attacks with those that they didn't.

36:31.020 --> 36:33.340
 They got the vaccine because heart attacks will happen

36:33.340 --> 36:37.700
 if you have 50,000 people because it's part of life.

36:37.700 --> 36:40.580
 These are the, all these processes are very, very,

36:40.580 --> 36:43.820
 very well established and since years.

36:43.820 --> 36:46.020
 What we did the last one was exactly the same

36:46.020 --> 36:47.140
 as we did always.

36:47.140 --> 36:49.300
 We just didn't lose time.

36:49.300 --> 36:51.780
 We didn't, we're not careful with money.

36:51.780 --> 36:57.260
 Instead of recruiting 50,000 people over a year,

36:57.260 --> 37:01.860
 because we had let's say 30 hospitals doing the recruitment,

37:01.860 --> 37:04.380
 we went with 150 hospitals doing the recruitment.

37:04.380 --> 37:05.820
 That cost a lot of money.

37:05.820 --> 37:07.980
 But instead of recruiting them in a year,

37:07.980 --> 37:10.100
 we recruited them in three, four months.

37:10.100 --> 37:15.220
 So I did this type of things by taking return on investment,

37:15.220 --> 37:17.300
 taking costs out of the equation

37:17.300 --> 37:19.220
 and we were able to achieve this result.

37:19.220 --> 37:22.500
 But it's not the process, believe me.

37:22.500 --> 37:25.220
 It is the heart of the people.

37:25.220 --> 37:29.460
 People don't know what they can and what they cannot do.

37:29.460 --> 37:32.500
 And if anything, they have a serious tendency

37:32.500 --> 37:35.300
 to underestimate what they can do.

37:35.300 --> 37:38.340
 And always, when you ask them something

37:38.340 --> 37:40.660
 that is seemingly impossible,

37:40.660 --> 37:44.540
 they will think out of the box to be able to deliver.

37:44.540 --> 37:45.900
 We discussed about the timing.

37:45.900 --> 37:48.940
 Instead of eight years, we then asked them to do it

37:48.940 --> 37:52.740
 in six, we asked them to do it in eight months.

37:52.740 --> 37:57.660
 Our normal manufacturing yearly production of Pfizer

37:57.660 --> 38:00.220
 was 200 million doses of vaccines every year.

38:00.220 --> 38:03.020
 That's what we are doing in the last 10 years.

38:03.020 --> 38:06.380
 We didn't ask them to make 300 million doses for a new vaccine.

38:06.380 --> 38:11.060
 We asked them to make 3 billion doses for a new vaccine.

38:11.060 --> 38:13.740
 The discovery phase of a new molecule,

38:13.740 --> 38:16.740
 like the treatment that we have now, the pill against COVID,

38:16.740 --> 38:18.300
 takes four years.

38:18.300 --> 38:19.660
 We didn't ask them to do it in three.

38:19.660 --> 38:20.980
 We asked them to do it in four months,

38:20.980 --> 38:22.580
 which is what they did.

38:22.580 --> 38:25.860
 When you are setting this type of goals,

38:25.860 --> 38:29.140
 they know immediately, they cannot just think

38:29.140 --> 38:30.340
 within the box.

38:30.340 --> 38:32.660
 And immediately, this is where the human ingenuity

38:32.660 --> 38:34.380
 and the heart comes.

38:34.380 --> 38:36.420
 And this is how they surprised all of us.

38:37.500 --> 38:40.020
 So there's incredible science and engineering

38:40.020 --> 38:40.860
 going on here.

38:40.860 --> 38:43.260
 This is an incredible thing. Absolutely.

38:43.260 --> 38:45.180
 This is what's bothering me,

38:45.180 --> 38:50.180
 that the conversation in public is often not about that.

38:52.180 --> 38:53.500
 It's about politics, unfortunately.

38:53.500 --> 38:54.340
 Politics.

38:54.340 --> 38:56.860
 So I spent the day with Elon Musk yesterday.

38:57.700 --> 38:59.340
 He works with rockets.

39:00.500 --> 39:02.460
 Similar situation as with Pfizer,

39:02.460 --> 39:04.580
 in the sense that there's NASA

39:04.580 --> 39:07.060
 and then there's this private company.

39:07.060 --> 39:11.460
 And that's a source of incredible inspiration to people.

39:11.460 --> 39:15.820
 No politics, very little politics.

39:15.820 --> 39:18.780
 So this is part of the thing I'm trying to,

39:18.780 --> 39:22.380
 I'm hoping to do our little part in this conversation

39:22.380 --> 39:25.700
 to help untangle a little bit,

39:25.700 --> 39:30.420
 just reveal the beauty and the power of the thing

39:30.420 --> 39:32.260
 that was done here, especially with the vaccine,

39:32.260 --> 39:33.500
 but other things that are being done

39:33.500 --> 39:35.180
 with the antiviral drug.

39:37.860 --> 39:39.940
 Let me just kind of linger on the safety.

39:39.940 --> 39:42.580
 What can you say?

39:42.580 --> 39:45.900
 There's a lot of people that are concerned

39:45.900 --> 39:49.100
 that the Pfizer vaccine, by the way,

39:49.100 --> 39:52.540
 of which I took two shots, no booster yet,

39:54.660 --> 39:55.740
 is unsafe.

39:56.740 --> 39:59.980
 What do you say to people that say that?

39:59.980 --> 40:03.300
 No, they should not fear something like that.

40:03.300 --> 40:04.620
 It's completely wrong.

40:04.620 --> 40:09.500
 There is no medical product in the history of humanity

40:09.500 --> 40:12.700
 that have been tested as much as this vaccine.

40:12.700 --> 40:16.940
 Has been administered to hundreds of millions of people.

40:16.940 --> 40:19.980
 And because of the importance of COVID,

40:19.980 --> 40:24.260
 they have been scrutinized, those people, constantly.

40:24.260 --> 40:27.140
 Right now, healthcare authorities are looking

40:27.140 --> 40:30.380
 for every single signal around the world

40:30.380 --> 40:31.500
 of people that they got the vaccine

40:31.500 --> 40:34.460
 and try to see if it is vaccine related or not.

40:34.460 --> 40:36.980
 There are electronic medical records

40:36.980 --> 40:40.620
 that will tell us when and what happened

40:40.620 --> 40:43.540
 to a person when he did got the vaccine.

40:43.540 --> 40:48.540
 And we know now, we have so high certainty

40:49.100 --> 40:54.100
 that it is so safe, exactly as the data sheet says

40:56.340 --> 40:59.180
 about this vaccine, more than any other product.

40:59.180 --> 41:01.500
 They should not be afraid of something like that.

41:01.500 --> 41:06.380
 And they should not listen to information

41:06.380 --> 41:09.340
 that it is misinformation, that it is spread on purpose.

41:10.460 --> 41:13.900
 Well, I don't like the word misinformation

41:13.900 --> 41:18.900
 because, you know, again, back to the Soviet Union,

41:21.220 --> 41:24.820
 anyone who opposes the state is spreading misinformation.

41:24.820 --> 41:27.460
 So you can basically call anything misinformation.

41:27.460 --> 41:29.900
 That's the unfortunate times we live in,

41:29.900 --> 41:34.060
 is you can call anyone, you can basically call anybody

41:34.060 --> 41:37.260
 a liar and say, I'm the sole possessor of the truth.

41:37.260 --> 41:40.100
 And just no offense to me, just because you wear a tie,

41:40.100 --> 41:43.100
 it doesn't mean you're any more likely to be

41:43.100 --> 41:45.660
 in the possession of the truth than anyone else.

41:45.660 --> 41:46.500
 So.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.220
 I wouldn't disagree with that at all.

41:48.220 --> 41:49.060
 I don't think that.

41:49.060 --> 41:50.500
 That's somebody who's not wearing a tie.

41:50.500 --> 41:52.300
 And as you can, people can see

41:52.300 --> 41:54.500
 that I'm not wearing a tie and you are.

41:54.500 --> 41:58.820
 But it's not about being able,

41:58.820 --> 42:03.820
 those that they have the power to impose on the others,

42:04.380 --> 42:09.380
 the stigma that what you're saying is misinformation.

42:09.700 --> 42:12.220
 But there are a few things that as society

42:12.220 --> 42:15.500
 we have accomplished and science is one of them.

42:15.500 --> 42:20.500
 And data is, and analytics of data is another one.

42:21.380 --> 42:26.380
 And to say that something which is highly scientific

42:26.380 --> 42:29.040
 by people that they are not scientists.

42:31.300 --> 42:35.520
 I think that it is not what you're describing,

42:35.520 --> 42:37.500
 what used to happen in Soviet Union

42:37.500 --> 42:42.300
 or in any other autocratic regime in the world right now.

42:42.300 --> 42:47.300
 But I definitely do think that the scientists,

42:47.540 --> 42:49.900
 the public science communicators I've listened to

42:49.900 --> 42:52.380
 over COVID have really disappointed me

42:52.380 --> 42:56.780
 because they have not spoken with empathy.

42:56.780 --> 42:58.760
 They haven't sufficiently in my view

42:58.760 --> 43:02.140
 have put their ego aside and really listened to people.

43:02.140 --> 43:03.980
 Yes, people that don't have a PhD,

43:03.980 --> 43:06.320
 people who have not really,

43:07.860 --> 43:10.460
 maybe not even taken like a biology course in college

43:10.460 --> 43:11.340
 or something like that.

43:11.340 --> 43:16.340
 But still they have children, they worry, they fear.

43:17.340 --> 43:19.000
 They don't know who to trust.

43:19.000 --> 43:23.740
 They don't know if they should listen to the CEO of Pfizer

43:23.740 --> 43:26.060
 who might have other incentives in mind,

43:26.060 --> 43:29.060
 who might just care about money and nothing else.

43:29.060 --> 43:32.580
 And so they just use common sense and they ask questions.

43:32.580 --> 43:35.180
 And I think to them talking down to them

43:35.180 --> 43:36.780
 as if they're not intelligent and so on

43:36.780 --> 43:39.520
 is something scientists have done

43:39.520 --> 43:40.660
 almost like rolled their eyes.

43:40.660 --> 43:42.900
 And that disappoints me because I think

43:42.900 --> 43:46.180
 that's kind of what is the source of division.

43:46.180 --> 43:47.500
 Humility is a virtue.

43:47.500 --> 43:48.340
 Yes.

43:48.340 --> 43:51.580
 And the fact that you are educated

43:51.580 --> 43:56.060
 doesn't mean that you are having either humility or empathy

43:56.060 --> 43:58.680
 or you have good human qualities.

43:58.680 --> 44:03.340
 This was never and will never be a metric

44:03.340 --> 44:05.220
 of judging this type of virtues.

44:06.420 --> 44:09.500
 Those that they do this, they're wrong.

44:09.500 --> 44:13.900
 And actually they are not doing good service

44:13.900 --> 44:15.900
 to the public health because they're undermining.

44:15.900 --> 44:17.100
 People are not stupid.

44:17.100 --> 44:21.300
 They see if you're not be respecting them

44:21.300 --> 44:23.980
 and if you're not respecting their need to learn

44:23.980 --> 44:25.220
 because that affects their health,

44:25.220 --> 44:27.100
 the health of the mother, of the kids.

44:27.100 --> 44:31.540
 So I fully agree with you that we should be very patient

44:31.540 --> 44:36.080
 to explain again and again and again what is happening.

44:36.080 --> 44:37.900
 And the vast majority of the people

44:37.900 --> 44:39.740
 that they don't get vaccinations right now

44:39.740 --> 44:41.140
 is because they're afraid.

44:41.140 --> 44:42.540
 It's not for any other reason.

44:42.540 --> 44:44.920
 It's not that they have an agenda.

44:44.920 --> 44:48.820
 What I'm saying it is there is a small number of people

44:48.820 --> 44:52.780
 that they have made business for them

44:52.780 --> 44:56.820
 to profit from this anxiety.

44:56.820 --> 44:58.020
 I'll give you an example.

44:59.340 --> 45:00.900
 I have been arrested by FBI.

45:00.900 --> 45:03.620
 This is what someone wrote.

45:03.620 --> 45:05.460
 I read it, I laughed.

45:05.460 --> 45:08.900
 I mean, okay, this is where they take it.

45:08.900 --> 45:11.200
 There was a reason why they wrote it that.

45:11.200 --> 45:13.060
 The Pfizer CEO was arrested by the FBI

45:13.060 --> 45:15.200
 because they want to create doubts

45:15.200 --> 45:18.020
 in the minds of the people that they're afraid

45:18.020 --> 45:19.680
 and say, look, if the FBI arrested him,

45:19.680 --> 45:21.460
 likely I will not do the vaccine.

45:21.460 --> 45:22.900
 But I laughed.

45:22.900 --> 45:27.900
 A week later, the wife of the Pfizer CEO died.

45:29.700 --> 45:32.340
 There is a picture in this website of my wife.

45:34.060 --> 45:36.900
 Someone sends to me, now I'm pissed.

45:36.900 --> 45:38.540
 I'm not laughing.

45:38.540 --> 45:41.020
 I tried to find my kids to tell them,

45:41.020 --> 45:42.820
 if you read something, mom is fine.

45:42.820 --> 45:44.140
 Don't worry.

45:44.140 --> 45:49.140
 Then I remember that she has very old parents back in Greece.

45:49.380 --> 45:51.340
 We start calling them to making sure

45:51.340 --> 45:53.080
 because so you know that that will be picked up

45:53.080 --> 45:56.100
 by Greek newspapers and they will publish it, okay?

45:56.100 --> 45:58.380
 They are those people that wrote these things.

45:58.380 --> 46:01.060
 They know very well that my wife didn't die

46:01.060 --> 46:04.860
 and died because she was vaccinated, right?

46:04.860 --> 46:09.860
 So this is the narratives that they are on purpose forming

46:09.860 --> 46:14.860
 to profit from the stress and the anxiety of good people.

46:18.540 --> 46:20.500
 And that's something I have to kind of,

46:20.500 --> 46:23.540
 people that listen to this, that kind of doubt institutions,

46:24.720 --> 46:29.220
 I do also want to say that there's quite a few folks

46:29.220 --> 46:34.220
 who realize they can make money from saying,

46:35.460 --> 46:37.860
 the man is lying to you.

46:37.860 --> 46:40.300
 The government is lying to you.

46:40.300 --> 46:42.460
 It's all corrupt.

46:42.460 --> 46:43.880
 It's all a scam.

46:44.740 --> 46:46.280
 Big pharma is lying to you.

46:46.280 --> 46:48.360
 They're manipulating you.

46:48.360 --> 46:51.700
 I'm surprised at how much money can be made with that.

46:51.700 --> 46:52.700
 And it's sad.

46:52.700 --> 46:56.580
 So you have to, just as people use their common sense

46:56.580 --> 47:00.420
 to be skeptical when listening to politicians

47:00.420 --> 47:03.340
 and powerful figures, they should be skeptical

47:03.340 --> 47:06.980
 to also when listening to sort of the conspiracy theorists

47:06.980 --> 47:08.740
 or not even the conspiracy theorists,

47:08.740 --> 47:11.780
 but people who raise questions about institutions.

47:11.780 --> 47:16.460
 Think on your own, think critically with an open mind

47:16.460 --> 47:19.660
 that everyone can be manipulating you,

47:19.660 --> 47:22.780
 but also everybody has the capacity to do good.

47:22.780 --> 47:26.220
 And I think science in its pure form,

47:26.220 --> 47:31.220
 not when entangled with institutions is a beautiful thing.

47:31.220 --> 47:33.180
 And in the hands of many companies,

47:33.180 --> 47:35.320
 it is a beautiful thing at scale.

47:35.320 --> 47:39.520
 Still, you have a lot of incentive

47:39.520 --> 47:42.720
 as having created the vaccine at Pfizer,

47:42.720 --> 47:47.720
 this incredible technology to sing it praises.

47:49.680 --> 47:53.700
 So there's a kind of, you know, people are skeptical,

47:53.700 --> 47:55.840
 like how much do we trust,

47:55.840 --> 48:00.760
 how excited Albert is about this vaccine.

48:00.760 --> 48:04.640
 So for example, I mean, not to do a Shakespearean analysis

48:04.640 --> 48:07.200
 of your Twitter, but I think he tweeted something

48:07.200 --> 48:11.760
 about a study with a 100% efficacy of the vaccine

48:11.760 --> 48:14.640
 or in stopping and transmission or something like that.

48:15.840 --> 48:20.840
 Do you regret sort of being like over representing

48:23.520 --> 48:24.880
 the effectiveness of the vaccine,

48:24.880 --> 48:27.600
 technically saying correct things,

48:27.600 --> 48:32.600
 but just kind of like highlighting the super positive things

48:32.600 --> 48:36.320
 that may be misinterpreted, you know, saying 100%?

48:36.320 --> 48:38.320
 No, I never said something 100%.

48:38.320 --> 48:41.440
 Every time I speak, if a number is 100%,

48:41.440 --> 48:44.520
 I rush to say that in biology, there is nothing 100%

48:44.520 --> 48:45.680
 because always there will be

48:45.680 --> 48:47.520
 when you go to the millions, okay?

48:47.520 --> 48:50.120
 There were in the study things that were 100%,

48:50.120 --> 48:52.720
 for example, deaths or in South Africa.

48:52.720 --> 48:56.480
 When we tried, there was 100% efficacy.

48:56.480 --> 48:58.140
 Clearly, it's more numbers.

48:58.140 --> 49:00.880
 When the numbers will become much bigger,

49:00.880 --> 49:04.840
 the 100% will not hold, but will be 95, 96.

49:04.840 --> 49:07.280
 So still the direction of this is the point.

49:07.280 --> 49:11.440
 So I'm very, very careful what I tweet.

49:11.440 --> 49:15.640
 And in addition to how careful I am,

49:15.640 --> 49:18.160
 I have people that they are looking at

49:18.160 --> 49:20.440
 and they're having second or third opinions

49:20.440 --> 49:22.480
 to make sure that we don't put, why?

49:22.480 --> 49:24.880
 Because I know that people are listening to me right now,

49:24.880 --> 49:27.760
 everything I say, and I want to make sure

49:27.760 --> 49:32.680
 that they continue not only being clear

49:32.680 --> 49:36.000
 as to what I want to say, so there are no misunderstandings,

49:36.000 --> 49:38.600
 but also I maintain the trust of the people.

49:38.600 --> 49:43.140
 I don't think that someone who only cherry picks information

49:43.140 --> 49:45.920
 and only emphasizes positive things,

49:45.920 --> 49:48.400
 it's someone that is the one to be trusted.

49:48.400 --> 49:51.120
 And I want me and Pfizer to be trusted.

49:52.080 --> 49:55.680
 So many felt the vaccine was presented as a cure

49:55.680 --> 49:58.800
 that wouldn't require regular booster shots.

49:58.800 --> 50:00.980
 Was that something you believed early on?

50:00.980 --> 50:02.940
 Did you always believe that many regular shots

50:02.940 --> 50:04.280
 would be required?

50:04.280 --> 50:05.840
 And maybe in a bigger picture,

50:05.840 --> 50:10.200
 how many do you think this will, for the Pfizer vaccine,

50:10.200 --> 50:13.160
 is it something you see that's taking a booster shot

50:13.160 --> 50:15.160
 regularly, like annually?

50:15.160 --> 50:17.960
 Yes, in the beginning when we had the first months

50:17.960 --> 50:20.000
 with the vaccine, people would ask me,

50:20.000 --> 50:20.940
 do we need another one?

50:20.940 --> 50:22.520
 And I said, we don't know.

50:22.520 --> 50:24.280
 I was very clear about it.

50:24.280 --> 50:27.080
 Then around April, May, I start seeing the first data

50:27.080 --> 50:31.760
 and I made statements that I think we will need a booster

50:31.760 --> 50:34.880
 around eight to 12 months after the second dose.

50:34.880 --> 50:37.440
 And then after that, annually vaccinations,

50:37.440 --> 50:39.000
 this is what I said,

50:39.000 --> 50:41.380
 believe is one of the most likely scenarios.

50:42.520 --> 50:44.400
 And it was based on the data that I had,

50:44.400 --> 50:46.200
 but then Delta came.

50:46.200 --> 50:48.960
 And because I always making the caveat

50:48.960 --> 50:52.880
 that with absent a new variant with everything we know.

50:52.880 --> 50:55.520
 With Delta, it was proven that we need the booster

50:55.520 --> 50:58.120
 to move to the three, to the six months.

50:58.120 --> 51:00.680
 And this is what happened.

51:00.680 --> 51:05.440
 And I still said, I think the booster is a six months.

51:05.440 --> 51:08.900
 And then I think it will be an annual revaccination likely.

51:08.900 --> 51:10.840
 We have to monitor to see the data,

51:10.840 --> 51:12.880
 but this is the likely scenario.

51:12.880 --> 51:15.060
 Now we have Omicron.

51:15.060 --> 51:19.040
 And Omicron says that two doses might be challenging.

51:19.040 --> 51:22.760
 We don't know exactly yet, but three doses work.

51:22.760 --> 51:26.200
 So clearly a lot of countries already started moving now

51:26.200 --> 51:29.760
 the third dose, not from six months to three.

51:29.760 --> 51:33.160
 So that they will reduce the period

51:33.160 --> 51:38.160
 that people will not be protected with the third dose.

51:39.840 --> 51:44.680
 I don't know with Omicron if how long this will last.

51:44.680 --> 51:47.080
 And frankly, I don't know if we will need a new vaccine

51:47.080 --> 51:51.120
 tailor made to Omicron based on everything we know so far.

51:51.120 --> 51:53.240
 We are monitoring and we will know way more

51:53.240 --> 51:54.720
 in the weeks to come.

51:54.720 --> 51:58.200
 If there is a need for a new vaccine, we will have it.

51:58.200 --> 52:00.640
 And if there is a need for mass production

52:00.640 --> 52:04.160
 of this new vaccine, I can also feel very comfortable

52:04.160 --> 52:06.680
 that we will not lose any of our capacity

52:06.680 --> 52:08.080
 that we have developed.

52:08.080 --> 52:12.560
 Right now we are running at 1 billion almost approximately

52:12.560 --> 52:15.800
 doses per quarter, four per year.

52:15.800 --> 52:18.860
 And if we have to switch and have half of that

52:18.860 --> 52:20.120
 in the new, half of that in the old,

52:20.120 --> 52:22.040
 we will do still 4 billion doses.

52:22.040 --> 52:26.280
 So I think the world should feel very, very comfortable

52:26.280 --> 52:30.000
 that if there is a need, we will be ahead of the virus.

52:30.000 --> 52:33.200
 Yeah, you did, you delivered or produced 3 billion

52:33.200 --> 52:35.480
 this year vaccines and you're on track

52:35.480 --> 52:37.560
 to do 4 billion next year.

52:37.560 --> 52:41.680
 I mean, if we had a lot more time,

52:41.680 --> 52:43.360
 we would talk about how the heck you achieve

52:43.360 --> 52:46.120
 that kind of scale, it's truly incredible.

52:46.120 --> 52:48.320
 Let me ask the policy question.

52:48.320 --> 52:51.120
 What are your feelings about vaccine mandates

52:52.040 --> 52:56.480
 in terms of, do you think the most effective way

52:56.480 --> 53:00.320
 to vaccinate the population is to acquire it?

53:00.320 --> 53:04.840
 Or do you go with the American way

53:04.840 --> 53:07.480
 and give people the freedom to choose?

53:07.480 --> 53:12.080
 I think it is a very difficult topic

53:12.080 --> 53:15.120
 and a very difficult decision for whoever needs to make it.

53:15.120 --> 53:16.680
 And clearly it's not me.

53:16.680 --> 53:19.040
 It is the public health officials of every country

53:19.040 --> 53:21.280
 that they have to make this decision.

53:21.280 --> 53:24.720
 I have to make the decision for Pfizer employees.

53:24.720 --> 53:29.720
 And I had to balance the fear of those that they work,

53:31.920 --> 53:35.040
 that they want to feel that the others are vaccinated

53:35.040 --> 53:36.720
 and the fear of those that they don't want

53:36.720 --> 53:38.040
 to get the vaccine.

53:38.040 --> 53:40.640
 And eventually I came to the decision

53:40.640 --> 53:42.920
 that we will mandate it at Pfizer.

53:42.920 --> 53:44.960
 We are flexible, we are giving exceptions,

53:44.960 --> 53:47.960
 of course for health, maybe some religions,

53:47.960 --> 53:51.160
 but we decided to mandate it.

53:51.160 --> 53:54.960
 Now, at Pfizer, when we did this decision,

53:54.960 --> 53:57.280
 we were at 90% vaccination rates

53:57.280 --> 53:59.640
 when we said we are going to mandate it.

53:59.640 --> 54:02.840
 And that took it up to 96.

54:03.800 --> 54:05.480
 It works, right?

54:06.440 --> 54:10.200
 This 10% was never going to move, I felt.

54:10.200 --> 54:12.680
 Because no matter what, you have a small number of people

54:12.680 --> 54:14.600
 that really are scared.

54:14.600 --> 54:17.320
 And they don't feel comfortable to do it, okay?

54:17.320 --> 54:20.440
 It worked in our case, we took it to 96%.

54:20.440 --> 54:22.240
 I'm happy for those people.

54:22.240 --> 54:25.480
 A lot will not disease and some will not die

54:25.480 --> 54:26.600
 of those people.

54:26.600 --> 54:29.880
 But it's not me to say, because the debate,

54:31.000 --> 54:32.680
 it's serious debate.

54:32.680 --> 54:34.520
 And there are a lot of pros and cons

54:34.520 --> 54:35.760
 if you need to push people,

54:35.760 --> 54:38.440
 if you need to give them the freedom.

54:38.440 --> 54:42.600
 And it comes with the territory.

54:42.600 --> 54:45.440
 If you are elected to run a country,

54:45.440 --> 54:47.680
 you should be ready to make difficult decisions.

54:47.680 --> 54:49.120
 And no matter what decision you make,

54:49.120 --> 54:50.720
 there will be fake stories written about you

54:50.720 --> 54:51.760
 as we talked about.

54:51.760 --> 54:53.840
 You will not be able to please everyone.

54:53.840 --> 54:54.680
 Yes.

54:55.920 --> 54:57.920
 Well, let me just say that I think,

54:57.920 --> 54:59.640
 again, coming from the Soviet Union,

54:59.640 --> 55:01.960
 I think at the public level, at the federal level,

55:01.960 --> 55:06.760
 mandates is a really bad idea.

55:06.760 --> 55:09.880
 Even if it's good for the health of the populace,

55:10.760 --> 55:12.280
 there's something about preserving the freedom

55:12.280 --> 55:14.560
 is really powerful about this country.

55:14.560 --> 55:17.000
 Like doing the hard work of convincing people

55:17.000 --> 55:20.440
 to get vaccinated, to choose to get vaccinated

55:20.440 --> 55:23.520
 if they want, but still have the freedom not to.

55:23.520 --> 55:25.720
 That's a really powerful freedom.

55:25.720 --> 55:28.400
 To me, it's super lazy to mandate.

55:28.400 --> 55:31.080
 People should understand the science

55:31.080 --> 55:32.720
 and want to get vaccinated.

55:38.480 --> 55:41.520
 Do you think children need to get vaccinated?

55:41.520 --> 55:42.360
 I do.

55:42.360 --> 55:44.560
 I do think that they need to get vaccinated.

55:44.560 --> 55:47.800
 So age ranges five to 16.

55:48.840 --> 55:50.800
 There's a lot of parents

55:53.400 --> 55:56.160
 that fear for the wellbeing of their children.

55:56.160 --> 55:57.920
 Can you empathize with those parents?

55:57.920 --> 56:01.080
 Can you steel man their arguments

56:01.080 --> 56:04.120
 against the vaccine for their children?

56:04.120 --> 56:06.120
 You know, because people know who I am.

56:06.120 --> 56:12.560
 I had the opportunity to interact with parents

56:12.560 --> 56:15.280
 before that was, let's say, approved.

56:15.280 --> 56:18.800
 And there were so many, way more,

56:18.800 --> 56:21.720
 that I had a lot of empathy

56:21.720 --> 56:24.080
 because they were afraid for their kids

56:24.080 --> 56:26.720
 because they didn't have a vaccine.

56:26.720 --> 56:30.240
 And they were the ones that were speaking at that time.

56:30.240 --> 56:31.120
 Bring me vaccine.

56:31.120 --> 56:32.720
 When are you going to bring me a vaccine?

56:32.720 --> 56:33.800
 I really fear.

56:33.800 --> 56:35.400
 I feel that this is unfair,

56:35.400 --> 56:36.640
 but I am protected.

56:36.640 --> 56:38.440
 My husband is protected.

56:38.440 --> 56:39.720
 My old son is protected.

56:39.720 --> 56:41.760
 And my little sweetheart,

56:41.760 --> 56:44.440
 because she's below the age, is not protected.

56:45.600 --> 56:47.440
 Now that we have the vaccines,

56:47.440 --> 56:50.600
 I'm sure that those that they are afraid of the vaccine,

56:50.600 --> 56:51.680
 not of the disease,

56:51.680 --> 56:54.440
 which are smaller number, admittedly.

56:54.440 --> 56:57.480
 Also, they will have, if they're afraid of them,

56:57.480 --> 57:00.080
 I'm sure that they will afraid even more about their kids

57:00.080 --> 57:02.240
 because they love, I would say,

57:02.240 --> 57:04.040
 more than they love themselves.

57:04.040 --> 57:06.400
 So it's going to be this situation.

57:06.400 --> 57:08.800
 And again, the same.

57:08.800 --> 57:12.200
 How can you do to demonstrate, to convince people,

57:12.200 --> 57:14.000
 to win the minds and the hearts of the people

57:14.000 --> 57:15.240
 that this is the right thing to do?

57:15.240 --> 57:16.720
 What do you think about that calculation?

57:16.720 --> 57:19.480
 Because the risk for kids is very low.

57:19.480 --> 57:20.840
 Kids do die.

57:20.840 --> 57:22.880
 Kids do go to the hospital from COVID.

57:22.880 --> 57:23.840
 Yes.

57:23.840 --> 57:25.600
 But the rate is very low.

57:25.600 --> 57:30.000
 The rate is lower, but kids, they do die.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.600
 And how can you say that I'm not going to,

57:32.600 --> 57:34.520
 I'm not going to protect a kid

57:34.520 --> 57:36.960
 for something that it is likely to happen?

57:36.960 --> 57:38.400
 And it is not only that.

57:38.400 --> 57:39.800
 What happens in the school

57:39.800 --> 57:42.600
 when they stop the education process

57:42.600 --> 57:44.840
 because a kid got the disease

57:44.840 --> 57:48.320
 and they don't have vaccines so that they can control.

57:48.320 --> 57:50.720
 It is such a big disruption

57:50.720 --> 57:55.720
 and such a big risk for the health of the kids

57:58.160 --> 57:59.720
 that it shouldn't be a debate.

57:59.720 --> 58:03.920
 Look, how many kids are having polio right now?

58:06.000 --> 58:08.480
 Way fewer number than those

58:08.480 --> 58:11.480
 that they're having COVID in the hospital.

58:11.480 --> 58:13.280
 But everybody's getting the vaccine.

58:14.920 --> 58:17.160
 Well, polio was deadlier for kids.

58:17.160 --> 58:18.280
 But it's not now.

58:18.280 --> 58:20.520
 So why a kid to do it now?

58:21.960 --> 58:23.600
 Because it needs to be protected.

58:23.600 --> 58:26.040
 Well, the unique thing about the COVID vaccine

58:26.040 --> 58:28.240
 is a new type of technology too.

58:28.240 --> 58:30.800
 So there's an extra concern.

58:30.800 --> 58:33.440
 Choosing to vaccinate a child,

58:33.440 --> 58:36.560
 you're making a choice that can potentially hurt them.

58:37.760 --> 58:39.480
 That's the way parents that are hesitant

58:39.480 --> 58:41.680
 about the vaccine think.

58:41.680 --> 58:46.680
 I think choosing to vaccinate children makes a choice

58:47.040 --> 58:49.320
 so that something could not potentially hurt them,

58:49.320 --> 58:50.280
 which is the disease.

58:50.280 --> 58:54.000
 That's why we are doing vaccinations since ever.

58:54.000 --> 58:57.360
 I know that there are people

58:57.360 --> 59:00.360
 that they're concerned for themselves and for their kids.

59:00.360 --> 59:05.360
 What I know it is that I'm a scientist and I'm a parent.

59:05.720 --> 59:09.160
 And I am telling you that vaccines

59:09.160 --> 59:10.440
 is a very good thing for kids.

59:10.440 --> 59:12.520
 And thank God we were able to develop.

59:14.720 --> 59:16.960
 So we've talked quite a bit about the vaccine,

59:16.960 --> 59:18.480
 but there's an incredible new technology

59:18.480 --> 59:20.120
 that Pfizer is developing

59:20.120 --> 59:24.000
 with the PaxLovid antiviral for COVID.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.320
 Where does that stand?

59:26.320 --> 59:28.640
 How does that work?

59:28.640 --> 59:33.440
 And how are you able to develop it in four months?

59:33.440 --> 59:36.400
 Like you said, and all of that in just a few minutes.

59:37.440 --> 59:39.320
 First of all, what this is about,

59:39.320 --> 59:41.920
 this is a real game changer.

59:41.920 --> 59:44.120
 This is a course of treatment

59:44.120 --> 59:47.080
 that you get only if you get the disease, you get COVID.

59:48.280 --> 59:51.960
 Then what happens is that you will take for five days,

59:51.960 --> 59:56.600
 pills day and night, and twice a day for five days.

59:56.600 --> 59:59.040
 And instead of 10 people from those that disease

59:59.040 --> 1:00:01.400
 to go to hospital, only one will go.

1:00:02.440 --> 1:00:06.080
 This is an end with all the caveats

1:00:06.080 --> 1:00:08.440
 that the numbers are small, no one died.

1:00:08.440 --> 1:00:11.280
 It was 100% efficacy on deaths.

1:00:11.280 --> 1:00:14.760
 Of course, I'm sure that in real world,

1:00:14.760 --> 1:00:16.080
 when the numbers are getting very high,

1:00:16.080 --> 1:00:18.760
 we may have 99 instead of 100.

1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:23.240
 But these are spectacular results

1:00:23.240 --> 1:00:25.880
 for something that you can take home and stay home.

1:00:25.880 --> 1:00:29.120
 The biggest problem right now in Europe, in the US,

1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:30.320
 when we have surges,

1:00:30.320 --> 1:00:34.200
 every time that we have a surge of COVID,

1:00:34.200 --> 1:00:36.880
 it is that the ICUs are full,

1:00:36.880 --> 1:00:39.240
 the hospitals are paralyzed,

1:00:39.240 --> 1:00:41.920
 they have to postpone elective surgeries,

1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:43.440
 they have to postpone other operations

1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:46.960
 because they don't have the capacity because of that.

1:00:46.960 --> 1:00:50.520
 Keeping people out of the hospitals, home,

1:00:50.520 --> 1:00:54.680
 keeping people without dying,

1:00:55.800 --> 1:00:57.800
 it is something that I didn't have before.

1:00:59.200 --> 1:01:02.760
 And this is a significant, significant game changer.

1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:08.120
 I have to ask a controversial, difficult question.

1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:11.720
 What are your thoughts about ivermectin?

1:01:11.720 --> 1:01:14.160
 Has it sufficiently been studied?

1:01:14.160 --> 1:01:17.200
 Has Pfizer considered it in its, like I said,

1:01:17.200 --> 1:01:19.360
 incredible development of the antiviral

1:01:20.400 --> 1:01:22.920
 as a comparator or that kind of thing?

1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:25.000
 Just investigate it in general.

1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:26.840
 The reason I bring it up,

1:01:26.840 --> 1:01:30.400
 because I've read quite a few criticisms of people.

1:01:30.400 --> 1:01:31.560
 There's been some comparisons

1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:33.400
 of paxilovir to the ivermectin,

1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:36.200
 and I think people should look up.

1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:39.480
 There is Dr. John Campbell that describes that comparison

1:01:39.480 --> 1:01:40.440
 and makes that claim,

1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:42.800
 and there's quite a lot of people that debunk

1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:44.520
 or argue against that.

1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:46.240
 You can do your own research,

1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:48.920
 but there is a lot of people that kind of see

1:01:48.920 --> 1:01:52.400
 this free drug without patents on it

1:01:52.400 --> 1:01:54.280
 and say this could be the savior.

1:01:54.280 --> 1:01:57.160
 So can you just speak to that comparison?

1:01:57.160 --> 1:01:58.160
 It's not the first time.

1:01:58.160 --> 1:02:00.600
 If you remember, there were other compounds

1:02:00.600 --> 1:02:05.600
 that were claimed that they are the solution to COVID,

1:02:08.320 --> 1:02:12.560
 and clearly they were proving that they're not.

1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:13.960
 There are compounds that are solutions

1:02:13.960 --> 1:02:15.400
 and compounds that are not.

1:02:15.400 --> 1:02:19.080
 I, as a scientist, and I discuss with our scientists,

1:02:19.080 --> 1:02:24.080
 they don't see any reason why a medicine like ivermectin,

1:02:24.520 --> 1:02:25.800
 which is a parasitic site,

1:02:25.800 --> 1:02:28.640
 to be able to act on COVID,

1:02:28.640 --> 1:02:31.680
 and so they don't see that there's any connection,

1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:34.840
 and they haven't seen any paper

1:02:34.840 --> 1:02:37.920
 that describes someone that used it that had any results.

1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:40.840
 I'm sure that there will be some people that will claim,

1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:43.000
 because people are claiming anything,

1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:46.760
 but I don't think that there was any paper

1:02:46.760 --> 1:02:49.240
 in any peer review magazine,

1:02:49.240 --> 1:02:52.920
 any reliable scientific magazine, to support this claim.

1:02:52.920 --> 1:02:56.680
 So we are focusing on saving people's lives.

1:02:56.680 --> 1:03:01.680
 We are not focusing on craziness.

1:03:02.080 --> 1:03:06.560
 Well, to push back, there is quite a lot of papers,

1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:08.000
 but the studies are small,

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.320
 so there's no conclusive evidence, and that's the point.

1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:12.920
 I haven't seen any that it is reliable.

1:03:12.920 --> 1:03:16.840
 I don't know where are these, small or big, reliable.

1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:18.300
 I haven't seen any.

1:03:18.300 --> 1:03:21.400
 Well, some of the big ones have been retracted,

1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:24.040
 which means they weren't legitimate.

1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:24.860
 Yes.

1:03:24.860 --> 1:03:25.700
 Yeah, so?

1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.160
 This is definitely something that people need to look into,

1:03:29.160 --> 1:03:31.880
 the people that kind of question

1:03:31.880 --> 1:03:33.280
 are the effectiveness of ivermectin,

1:03:33.280 --> 1:03:35.600
 definitely something to think about,

1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:37.600
 and I think it's the reason that past public.

1:03:37.600 --> 1:03:39.200
 It was chloroquine alone before.

1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:40.320
 Yes.

1:03:40.320 --> 1:03:41.440
 For God's sake.

1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:42.280
 That's why PaxLovid.

1:03:42.280 --> 1:03:44.180
 How many people died because of that?

1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:48.580
 Yeah, this is the dangerous thing.

1:03:48.580 --> 1:03:49.840
 This is the sad thing.

1:03:51.720 --> 1:03:53.760
 PaxLovid has been studying thousands of people

1:03:53.760 --> 1:03:58.200
 and will be under the scrutiny, not only of regulators,

1:03:58.200 --> 1:04:00.960
 but as we will go into the implementation,

1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:02.600
 as it happened in many countries,

1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:04.880
 they will monitor to see what's happened.

1:04:04.880 --> 1:04:07.800
 Let's say that whatever we do, once it is out there,

1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:10.640
 within a few weeks, they will know all hospitals,

1:04:10.640 --> 1:04:13.840
 if it works or not, because they will see the statistics.

1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:18.360
 We've gone through one of the more difficult periods

1:04:19.320 --> 1:04:21.760
 in recent human history over the past two years,

1:04:21.760 --> 1:04:23.240
 like as a society.

1:04:23.240 --> 1:04:26.340
 What gives you hope about the future

1:04:26.340 --> 1:04:28.120
 for our human civilization?

1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:31.720
 You look into the next few years.

1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:34.080
 I think the human ingenuity.

1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:36.920
 I think although there is,

1:04:36.920 --> 1:04:39.160
 the world always is progressing,

1:04:39.160 --> 1:04:40.400
 although there are a lot of things

1:04:40.400 --> 1:04:44.640
 that need to be fixed in the society of 2020.

1:04:45.960 --> 1:04:49.800
 The society of 2020 is better at large

1:04:49.800 --> 1:04:53.160
 than things 50 years back, 100 years back,

1:04:53.160 --> 1:04:56.360
 in all different aspects, from poverty,

1:04:56.360 --> 1:05:00.880
 for human rights, from science,

1:05:00.880 --> 1:05:03.440
 from quality of life, from any aspect.

1:05:03.440 --> 1:05:08.440
 I am positive that humans can create

1:05:09.240 --> 1:05:11.240
 and always create a better future

1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:12.560
 and will continue doing so.

1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:17.800
 You have helped save the lives of millions of people,

1:05:17.800 --> 1:05:20.080
 helped improve the quality of their lives,

1:05:20.080 --> 1:05:24.240
 but you yourself are just one biological organism

1:05:24.240 --> 1:05:26.120
 with an expiration date.

1:05:26.120 --> 1:05:28.200
 Do you ponder your mortality?

1:05:28.200 --> 1:05:30.440
 Do you think about your death?

1:05:30.440 --> 1:05:32.400
 Are you afraid of death?

1:05:32.400 --> 1:05:34.240
 That's a very interesting question.

1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:37.160
 I was discussing with a lot of people

1:05:37.160 --> 1:05:40.080
 that I was fearless of death, I couldn't care less,

1:05:40.080 --> 1:05:41.940
 when I was young.

1:05:41.940 --> 1:05:46.320
 The first time that I start feeling

1:05:46.320 --> 1:05:49.960
 that I want to be around was when I had kids.

1:05:49.960 --> 1:05:52.120
 And then I started feeling that,

1:05:52.120 --> 1:05:56.400
 oh gosh, I hope I will be around to see their wedding.

1:05:56.400 --> 1:05:59.720
 I hope they will be around to see their children.

1:05:59.720 --> 1:06:02.640
 So if there is something that scares me,

1:06:02.640 --> 1:06:05.560
 the possibility I will not be part of their lives anymore

1:06:05.560 --> 1:06:06.760
 and I will not be watching.

1:06:06.760 --> 1:06:09.000
 I hope there is life upstairs,

1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:11.720
 so I will be able to watch them from there.

1:06:11.720 --> 1:06:14.020
 From upstairs, get a nice overview.

1:06:15.720 --> 1:06:17.720
 Let me ask the big ridiculous question.

1:06:19.320 --> 1:06:22.960
 And you only have two minutes or less to answer it.

1:06:22.960 --> 1:06:24.320
 What is the meaning of life?

1:06:24.320 --> 1:06:26.020
 What's the meaning of this whole thing?

1:06:26.020 --> 1:06:29.000
 You said ingenuity is the thing that gives you hope.

1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:31.320
 We seem to be all busy trying to help each other,

1:06:31.320 --> 1:06:33.040
 trying to build a better world.

1:06:33.040 --> 1:06:34.160
 Why are we doing that?

1:06:34.160 --> 1:06:38.680
 I would repeat something that Steve Jobs has said.

1:06:38.680 --> 1:06:41.520
 Death is life's biggest invention.

1:06:42.720 --> 1:06:46.320
 It eliminates the old and gives place to the new.

1:06:47.480 --> 1:06:50.600
 Life is all about moving forward.

1:06:51.520 --> 1:06:56.520
 Life is all about creating new things.

1:06:56.520 --> 1:07:00.120
 And maybe everyone is a contributor,

1:07:00.120 --> 1:07:01.600
 but no one is the owner.

1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.200
 And always creating something new.

1:07:05.200 --> 1:07:06.320
 Always.

1:07:06.320 --> 1:07:08.080
 Adding something beautiful into the world,

1:07:08.080 --> 1:07:09.440
 maybe a little bit of love.

1:07:10.480 --> 1:07:11.700
 Hopefully.

1:07:11.700 --> 1:07:12.840
 Albert, thank you so much.

1:07:12.840 --> 1:07:15.680
 It's a huge honor that you go through

1:07:15.680 --> 1:07:18.200
 some of these difficult questions with me today

1:07:18.200 --> 1:07:20.840
 and that you give your extremely valuable time

1:07:20.840 --> 1:07:21.840
 for this conversation.

1:07:21.840 --> 1:07:23.000
 Thank you so much for talking today.

1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.520
 Thank you for your interest and I'm happy,

1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:26.640
 as I was telling you before,

1:07:26.640 --> 1:07:31.640
 but I can brag with my kids that I was in your podcast

1:07:31.680 --> 1:07:33.320
 because you are their hero.

1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:34.160
 You made it.

1:07:34.160 --> 1:07:35.680
 I made it.

1:07:35.680 --> 1:07:36.520
 Thank you.

1:07:36.520 --> 1:07:37.680
 Thank you.

1:07:37.680 --> 1:07:40.600
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Albert Burla.

1:07:40.600 --> 1:07:41.880
 To support this podcast,

1:07:41.880 --> 1:07:44.440
 please check out our sponsors in the description.

1:07:44.440 --> 1:07:48.400
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Oscar Wilde.

1:07:48.400 --> 1:07:52.320
 The truth is rarely pure and never simple.

1:07:52.320 --> 1:07:55.480
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
