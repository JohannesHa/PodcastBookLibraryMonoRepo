00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
 The following is a conversation with Jordan Ellenberg,

00:02.960 --> 00:05.560
 a mathematician at University of Wisconsin

00:05.560 --> 00:08.900
 and an author who masterfully reveals the beauty

00:08.900 --> 00:12.180
 and power of mathematics in his 2014 book,

00:12.180 --> 00:15.000
 How Not To Be Wrong, and his new book,

00:15.000 --> 00:17.540
 just released recently, called Shape,

00:17.540 --> 00:20.440
 The Hidden Geometry of Information, Biology,

00:20.440 --> 00:23.400
 Strategy, Democracy, and Everything Else.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.360
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:25.360 --> 00:29.840
 Secret Sauce, ExpressVPN, Blinkist, and Indeed.

00:29.840 --> 00:33.160
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.020
 As a side note, let me say that geometry

00:35.020 --> 00:37.440
 is what made me fall in love with mathematics

00:37.440 --> 00:38.560
 when I was young.

00:38.560 --> 00:41.100
 It first showed me that something definitive

00:41.100 --> 00:42.960
 could be stated about this world

00:42.960 --> 00:45.440
 through intuitive visual proofs.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.840
 Somehow, that convinced me that math

00:47.840 --> 00:50.600
 is not just abstract numbers devoid of life,

00:50.600 --> 00:53.380
 but a part of life, part of this world,

00:53.380 --> 00:55.720
 part of our search for meaning.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.680
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast,

00:57.680 --> 01:00.900
 and here is my conversation with Jordan Ellenberg.

01:01.860 --> 01:03.880
 If the brain is a cake.

01:03.880 --> 01:05.040
 It is?

01:05.040 --> 01:07.080
 Well, let's just go with me on this, okay?

01:07.080 --> 01:08.160
 Okay, we'll pause it.

01:08.160 --> 01:12.680
 So for Noam Chomsky, language,

01:12.680 --> 01:16.000
 the universal grammar, the framework

01:16.000 --> 01:19.960
 from which language springs is like most of the cake,

01:19.960 --> 01:21.880
 the delicious chocolate center,

01:21.880 --> 01:25.040
 and then the rest of cognition that we think of

01:25.040 --> 01:27.760
 is built on top, extra layers,

01:27.760 --> 01:28.940
 maybe the icing on the cake,

01:28.940 --> 01:33.100
 maybe consciousness is just like a cherry on top.

01:34.100 --> 01:37.980
 Where do you put in this cake mathematical thinking?

01:37.980 --> 01:40.800
 Is it as fundamental as language?

01:40.800 --> 01:44.600
 In the Chomsky view, is it more fundamental than language?

01:44.600 --> 01:47.760
 Is it echoes of the same kind of abstract framework

01:47.760 --> 01:49.480
 that he's thinking about in terms of language

01:49.480 --> 01:52.160
 that they're all really tightly interconnected?

01:52.980 --> 01:54.880
 That's a really interesting question.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.560
 You're getting me to reflect on this question

01:56.560 --> 02:00.780
 of whether the feeling of producing mathematical output,

02:00.780 --> 02:04.400
 if you want, is like the process of uttering language

02:04.400 --> 02:05.960
 or producing linguistic output.

02:07.080 --> 02:09.000
 I think it feels something like that,

02:09.000 --> 02:10.640
 and it's certainly the case.

02:10.640 --> 02:11.480
 Let me put it this way.

02:11.480 --> 02:14.480
 It's hard to imagine doing mathematics

02:14.480 --> 02:17.400
 in a completely nonlinguistic way.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.680
 It's hard to imagine doing mathematics

02:19.680 --> 02:22.040
 without talking about mathematics

02:22.040 --> 02:23.800
 and sort of thinking in propositions.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.800
 But maybe it's just because that's the way I do mathematics,

02:26.800 --> 02:29.600
 and maybe I can't imagine it any other way, right?

02:29.600 --> 02:32.760
 Well, what about visualizing shapes,

02:32.760 --> 02:35.680
 visualizing concepts to which language

02:35.680 --> 02:38.240
 is not obviously attachable?

02:38.240 --> 02:40.120
 Ah, that's a really interesting question.

02:40.120 --> 02:43.560
 And one thing it reminds me of is one thing I talk about

02:43.560 --> 02:45.800
 in the book is dissection proofs,

02:45.800 --> 02:48.760
 these very beautiful proofs of geometric propositions.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.520
 There's a very famous one by Baskara

02:50.520 --> 02:55.520
 of the Pythagorean theorem, proofs which are purely visual,

02:56.560 --> 03:00.260
 proofs where you show that two quantities are the same

03:00.260 --> 03:04.360
 by taking the same pieces and putting them together one way

03:04.360 --> 03:07.400
 and making one shape and putting them together another way

03:07.400 --> 03:08.520
 and making a different shape,

03:08.520 --> 03:09.760
 and then observing that those two shapes

03:09.760 --> 03:10.640
 must have the same area

03:10.640 --> 03:13.120
 because they were built out of the same pieces.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.120
 There's a famous story,

03:16.120 --> 03:19.300
 and it's a little bit disputed about how accurate this is,

03:19.300 --> 03:20.680
 but that in Baskara's manuscript,

03:20.680 --> 03:22.620
 he sort of gives this proof, just gives the diagram,

03:22.620 --> 03:26.160
 and then the entire verbal content of the proof

03:26.160 --> 03:28.400
 is he just writes under it, behold.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.240
 Like that's it.

03:29.240 --> 03:32.280
 And it's like, there's some dispute

03:32.280 --> 03:33.680
 about exactly how accurate that is.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.520
 But so then there's an interesting question.

03:36.520 --> 03:39.920
 If your proof is a diagram, if your proof is a picture,

03:39.920 --> 03:42.280
 or even if your proof is like a movie of the same pieces

03:42.280 --> 03:43.940
 like coming together in two different formations

03:43.940 --> 03:45.760
 to make two different things, is that language?

03:45.760 --> 03:46.600
 I'm not sure I have a good answer.

03:46.600 --> 03:47.680
 What do you think?

03:47.680 --> 03:51.080
 I think it is. I think the process

03:51.080 --> 03:55.000
 of manipulating the visual elements

03:55.000 --> 03:56.520
 is the same as the process

03:56.520 --> 03:59.480
 of manipulating the elements of language.

03:59.480 --> 04:02.960
 And I think probably the manipulating, the aggregation,

04:02.960 --> 04:05.800
 the stitching stuff together is the important part.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.680
 It's not the actual specific elements.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.520
 It's more like, to me, language is a process

04:10.520 --> 04:11.780
 and math is a process.

04:11.780 --> 04:15.040
 It's not just specific symbols.

04:15.040 --> 04:18.160
 It's in action.

04:19.080 --> 04:23.680
 It's ultimately created through action, through change.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.200
 And so you're constantly evolving ideas.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.880
 Of course, we kind of attach,

04:27.880 --> 04:29.760
 there's a certain destination you arrive to

04:29.760 --> 04:32.080
 that you attach to and you call that a proof,

04:32.080 --> 04:34.600
 but that's not, that doesn't need to end there.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.000
 It's just at the end of the chapter

04:36.000 --> 04:39.160
 and then it goes on and on and on in that kind of way.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.720
 But I gotta ask you about geometry

04:40.720 --> 04:44.840
 and it's a prominent topic in your new book, Shape.

04:44.840 --> 04:48.020
 So for me, geometry is the thing,

04:48.020 --> 04:49.560
 just like as you're saying,

04:49.560 --> 04:52.360
 made me fall in love with mathematics when I was young.

04:53.340 --> 04:55.720
 So being able to prove something visually

04:56.760 --> 05:01.000
 just did something to my brain that it had this,

05:01.000 --> 05:02.600
 it planted this hopeful seed

05:02.600 --> 05:07.320
 that you can understand the world, like perfectly.

05:07.320 --> 05:08.580
 Maybe it's an OCD thing,

05:08.580 --> 05:10.440
 but from a mathematics perspective,

05:10.440 --> 05:14.480
 like humans are messy, the world is messy, biology is messy.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.120
 Your parents are yelling or making you do stuff,

05:17.120 --> 05:19.560
 but you can cut through all that BS

05:19.560 --> 05:22.000
 and truly understand the world through mathematics

05:22.000 --> 05:25.320
 and nothing like geometry did that for me.

05:25.320 --> 05:28.240
 For you, you did not immediately fall in love

05:28.240 --> 05:33.240
 with geometry, so how do you think about geometry?

05:33.760 --> 05:36.740
 Why is it a special field in mathematics?

05:36.740 --> 05:39.920
 And how did you fall in love with it if you have?

05:39.920 --> 05:41.760
 Wow, you've given me like a lot to say.

05:41.760 --> 05:44.320
 And certainly the experience that you describe

05:44.320 --> 05:47.460
 is so typical, but there's two versions of it.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.240
 One thing I say in the book

05:49.240 --> 05:51.720
 is that geometry is the cilantro of math.

05:51.720 --> 05:52.880
 People are not neutral about it.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.560
 There's people who like you are like,

05:55.560 --> 05:56.840
 the rest of it I could take or leave,

05:56.840 --> 05:59.200
 but then at this one moment, it made sense.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.400
 This class made sense, why wasn't it all like that?

06:01.400 --> 06:02.880
 There's other people, I can tell you,

06:02.880 --> 06:04.740
 because they come and talk to me all the time,

06:04.740 --> 06:06.760
 who are like, I understood all the stuff

06:06.760 --> 06:08.140
 where you're trying to figure out what X was,

06:08.140 --> 06:09.460
 there's some mystery you're trying to solve it,

06:09.460 --> 06:10.680
 X is a number, I figured it out.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.960
 But then there was this geometry, like what was that?

06:12.960 --> 06:14.360
 What happened that year? Like I didn't get it.

06:14.360 --> 06:15.480
 I was like lost the whole year

06:15.480 --> 06:17.080
 and I didn't understand like why we even

06:17.080 --> 06:18.160
 spent the time doing that.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.440
 So, but what everybody agrees on

06:20.440 --> 06:22.360
 is that it's somehow different, right?

06:22.360 --> 06:24.120
 There's something special about it.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.120
 We're gonna walk around in circles a little bit,

06:27.120 --> 06:27.960
 but we'll get there.

06:27.960 --> 06:32.440
 You asked me how I fell in love with math.

06:32.440 --> 06:33.740
 I have a story about this.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.040
 When I was a small child, I don't know,

06:39.040 --> 06:42.040
 maybe like I was six or seven, I don't know.

06:42.040 --> 06:42.880
 I'm from the 70s.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.440
 I think you're from a different decade than that.

06:44.440 --> 06:48.560
 But in the 70s, we had a cool wooden box

06:48.560 --> 06:49.520
 around your stereo.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.460
 That was the look, everything was dark wood.

06:51.460 --> 06:53.560
 And the box had a bunch of holes in it

06:53.560 --> 06:54.600
 to let the sound out.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.960
 And the holes were in this rectangular array,

06:58.960 --> 07:02.480
 a six by eight array of holes.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.280
 And I was just kind of like zoning out

07:04.280 --> 07:06.040
 in the living room as kids do,

07:06.040 --> 07:09.800
 looking at this six by eight rectangular array of holes.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.720
 And if you like, just by kind of like focusing in and out,

07:12.720 --> 07:14.480
 just by kind of looking at this box,

07:14.480 --> 07:17.080
 looking at this rectangle, I was like,

07:17.080 --> 07:20.860
 well, there's six rows of eight holes each,

07:21.900 --> 07:25.640
 but there's also eight columns of six holes each.

07:25.640 --> 07:26.480
 Whoa.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.040
 So eight sixes and six eights.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.080
 It's just like the dissection proofs

07:30.080 --> 07:32.320
 we were just talking about, but it's the same holes.

07:32.320 --> 07:33.480
 It's the same 48 holes.

07:33.480 --> 07:34.320
 That's how many there are,

07:34.320 --> 07:36.800
 no matter whether you count them as rows

07:36.800 --> 07:38.000
 or count them as columns.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.760
 And this was like unbelievable to me.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.000
 Am I allowed to cuss on your podcast?

07:43.000 --> 07:45.240
 I don't know if that's, are we FCC regulated?

07:45.240 --> 07:47.080
 Okay, it was fucking unbelievable.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.000
 Okay, that's the last time.

07:48.000 --> 07:48.840
 Get it in there.

07:48.840 --> 07:49.660
 This story merits it.

07:49.660 --> 07:54.240
 So two different perspectives in the same physical reality.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.280
 Exactly.

07:55.280 --> 07:56.860
 And it's just as you say.

07:58.520 --> 08:01.440
 I knew that six times eight was the same as eight times six.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.640
 I knew my times tables.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.720
 I knew that that was a fact.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.600
 But did I really know it until that moment?

08:06.600 --> 08:08.640
 That's the question, right?

08:08.640 --> 08:11.640
 I sort of knew that the times table was symmetric,

08:11.640 --> 08:13.960
 but I didn't know why that was the case until that moment.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.160
 And in that moment I could see like,

08:15.160 --> 08:17.700
 oh, I didn't have to have somebody tell me that.

08:17.700 --> 08:20.200
 That's information that you can just directly access.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.600
 That's a really amazing moment.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.920
 And as math teachers, that's something

08:22.920 --> 08:25.560
 that we're really trying to bring to our students.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.560
 And I was one of those who did not love

08:27.560 --> 08:30.540
 the kind of Euclidean geometry ninth grade class

08:30.540 --> 08:33.080
 of like prove that an isosceles triangle

08:33.080 --> 08:35.520
 has equal angles at the base, like this kind of thing.

08:35.520 --> 08:39.020
 It didn't vibe with me the way that algebra and numbers did.

08:39.020 --> 08:40.720
 But if you go back to that moment,

08:40.720 --> 08:41.860
 from my adult perspective,

08:41.860 --> 08:43.620
 looking back at what happened with that rectangle,

08:43.620 --> 08:45.460
 I think that is a very geometric moment.

08:45.460 --> 08:49.040
 In fact, that moment exactly encapsulates

08:49.920 --> 08:53.060
 the intertwining of algebra and geometry.

08:53.060 --> 08:55.880
 This algebraic fact that, well, in the instance,

08:55.880 --> 08:57.880
 eight times six is equal to six times eight.

08:57.880 --> 09:00.160
 But in general, that whatever two numbers you have,

09:00.160 --> 09:01.320
 you multiply them one way.

09:01.320 --> 09:02.760
 And it's the same as if you multiply them

09:02.760 --> 09:03.700
 in the other order.

09:03.700 --> 09:07.500
 It attaches it to this geometric fact about a rectangle,

09:07.500 --> 09:09.540
 which in some sense makes it true.

09:09.540 --> 09:11.380
 So, who knows, maybe I was always fated

09:11.380 --> 09:12.380
 to be an algebraic geometer,

09:12.380 --> 09:15.060
 which is what I am as a researcher.

09:15.060 --> 09:17.340
 So that's the kind of transformation.

09:17.340 --> 09:19.340
 And you talk about symmetry in your book.

09:20.340 --> 09:22.040
 What the heck is symmetry?

09:22.940 --> 09:26.260
 What the heck is these kinds of transformation on objects

09:26.260 --> 09:29.480
 that once you transform them, they seem to be similar?

09:29.480 --> 09:30.500
 What do you make of it?

09:30.500 --> 09:32.180
 What's its use in mathematics

09:32.180 --> 09:35.340
 or maybe broadly in understanding our world?

09:35.340 --> 09:37.380
 Well, it's an absolutely fundamental concept.

09:37.380 --> 09:39.740
 And it starts with the word symmetry

09:39.740 --> 09:41.220
 in the way that we usually use it

09:41.220 --> 09:42.620
 when we're just like talking English

09:42.620 --> 09:43.780
 and not talking mathematics, right?

09:43.780 --> 09:46.940
 Sort of something is, when we say something is symmetrical,

09:46.940 --> 09:49.820
 we usually means it has what's called an axis of symmetry.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.260
 Maybe like the left half of it

09:51.260 --> 09:52.580
 looks the same as the right half.

09:52.580 --> 09:55.020
 That would be like a left, right axis of symmetry.

09:55.020 --> 09:57.820
 Or maybe the top half looks like the bottom half or both.

09:57.820 --> 09:59.320
 Maybe there's sort of a fourfold symmetry

09:59.320 --> 10:00.160
 where the top looks like the bottom

10:00.160 --> 10:03.620
 and the left looks like the right or more.

10:03.620 --> 10:06.380
 And that can take you in a lot of different directions.

10:06.380 --> 10:09.480
 The abstract study of what the possible combinations

10:09.480 --> 10:10.480
 of symmetries there are,

10:10.480 --> 10:11.820
 a subject which is called group theory

10:11.820 --> 10:14.940
 was actually one of my first loves in mathematics

10:14.940 --> 10:17.600
 when I thought about a lot when I was in college.

10:17.600 --> 10:21.300
 But the notion of symmetry is actually much more general

10:21.300 --> 10:23.100
 than the things that we would call symmetry

10:23.100 --> 10:25.480
 if we were looking at like a classical building

10:25.480 --> 10:30.300
 or a painting or something like that.

10:30.300 --> 10:33.280
 Nowadays in math,

10:35.520 --> 10:38.740
 we could use a symmetry to refer to

10:38.740 --> 10:41.580
 any kind of transformation of an image

10:41.580 --> 10:43.900
 or a space or an object.

10:43.900 --> 10:46.500
 So what I talk about in the book is

10:48.040 --> 10:50.580
 take a figure and stretch it vertically,

10:50.580 --> 10:53.940
 make it twice as big vertically

10:53.940 --> 10:56.360
 and make it half as wide.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.100
 That I would call a symmetry.

11:00.100 --> 11:03.300
 It's not a symmetry in the classical sense,

11:03.300 --> 11:05.740
 but it's a well defined transformation

11:05.740 --> 11:07.620
 that has an input and an output.

11:07.620 --> 11:10.960
 I give you some shape and it gets kind of,

11:10.960 --> 11:12.180
 I call this in the book a scrunch.

11:12.180 --> 11:14.460
 I just had to make up some sort of funny sounding name

11:14.460 --> 11:18.360
 for it because it doesn't really have a name.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.740
 And just as you can sort of study

11:21.740 --> 11:23.820
 which kinds of objects are symmetrical

11:23.820 --> 11:26.020
 under the operations of switching left and right

11:26.020 --> 11:27.540
 or switching top and bottom

11:27.540 --> 11:29.900
 or rotating 40 degrees or what have you,

11:31.580 --> 11:33.900
 you could study what kinds of things are preserved

11:33.900 --> 11:36.360
 by this kind of scrunch symmetry.

11:36.360 --> 11:39.500
 And this kind of more general idea

11:39.500 --> 11:40.920
 of what a symmetry can be.

11:42.520 --> 11:43.720
 Let me put it this way.

11:44.860 --> 11:47.300
 A fundamental mathematical idea,

11:47.300 --> 11:49.020
 in some sense, I might even say the idea

11:49.020 --> 11:51.380
 that dominates contemporary mathematics.

11:51.380 --> 11:52.380
 Or by contemporary, by the way,

11:52.380 --> 11:54.260
 I mean like the last like 150 years.

11:54.260 --> 11:56.220
 We're on a very long time scale in math.

11:56.220 --> 11:57.060
 I don't mean like yesterday.

11:57.060 --> 12:00.960
 I mean like a century or so up till now.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.580
 Is this idea that it's a fundamental question

12:02.580 --> 12:07.140
 of when do we consider two things to be the same?

12:07.140 --> 12:08.740
 That might seem like a complete triviality.

12:08.740 --> 12:10.020
 It's not.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.140
 For instance, if I have a triangle

12:13.200 --> 12:14.940
 and I have a triangle of the exact same dimensions,

12:14.940 --> 12:19.340
 but it's over here, are those the same or different?

12:19.340 --> 12:20.280
 Well, you might say, well, look,

12:20.280 --> 12:21.120
 there's two different things.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.420
 This one's over here, this one's over there.

12:22.420 --> 12:25.780
 On the other hand, if you prove a theorem about this one,

12:25.780 --> 12:27.700
 it's probably still true about this one

12:27.700 --> 12:29.860
 if it has like all the same side lanes and angles

12:29.860 --> 12:31.460
 and like looks exactly the same.

12:31.460 --> 12:32.660
 The term of art, if you want it,

12:32.660 --> 12:34.740
 you would say they're congruent.

12:34.740 --> 12:36.840
 But one way of saying it is there's a symmetry

12:36.840 --> 12:38.620
 called translation, which just means

12:38.620 --> 12:40.780
 move everything three inches to the left.

12:40.780 --> 12:43.100
 And we want all of our theories

12:43.100 --> 12:45.460
 to be translation invariant.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.940
 What that means is that if you prove a theorem

12:46.940 --> 12:48.880
 about a thing that's over here,

12:48.880 --> 12:51.660
 and then you move it three inches to the left,

12:51.660 --> 12:53.460
 it would be kind of weird if all of your theorems

12:53.460 --> 12:55.820
 like didn't still work.

12:55.820 --> 12:58.620
 So this question of like, what are the symmetries

12:58.620 --> 12:59.940
 and which things that you want to study

12:59.940 --> 13:01.460
 are invariant under those symmetries

13:01.460 --> 13:02.380
 is absolutely fundamental.

13:02.380 --> 13:04.020
 Boy, this is getting a little abstract, right?

13:04.020 --> 13:05.160
 It's not at all abstract.

13:05.160 --> 13:08.380
 I think this is completely central

13:08.380 --> 13:09.760
 to everything I think about

13:09.760 --> 13:11.380
 in terms of artificial intelligence.

13:11.380 --> 13:13.540
 I don't know if you know about the MNIST dataset,

13:13.540 --> 13:15.140
 what's handwritten digits.

13:15.140 --> 13:20.140
 And you know, I don't smoke much weed or any really,

13:21.680 --> 13:24.240
 but it certainly feels like it when I look at MNIST

13:24.240 --> 13:26.360
 and think about this stuff, which is like,

13:26.360 --> 13:28.600
 what's the difference between one and two?

13:28.600 --> 13:32.200
 And why are all the twos similar to each other?

13:32.200 --> 13:37.200
 What kind of transformations are within the category

13:37.200 --> 13:39.160
 of what makes a thing the same?

13:39.160 --> 13:40.720
 And what kind of transformations

13:40.720 --> 13:42.520
 are those that make it different?

13:42.520 --> 13:44.020
 And symmetries core to that.

13:44.020 --> 13:46.760
 In fact, whatever the hell our brain is doing,

13:46.760 --> 13:50.440
 it's really good at constructing these arbitrary

13:50.440 --> 13:53.160
 and sometimes novel, which is really important

13:53.160 --> 13:58.000
 when you look at like the IQ test or they feel novel,

13:58.000 --> 14:02.880
 ideas of symmetry of like playing with objects,

14:02.880 --> 14:06.120
 we're able to see things that are the same and not

14:07.020 --> 14:11.720
 and construct almost like little geometric theories

14:11.720 --> 14:13.400
 of what makes things the same and not

14:13.400 --> 14:17.400
 and how to make programs do that in AI

14:17.400 --> 14:19.120
 is a total open question.

14:19.120 --> 14:21.840
 And so I kind of stared and wonder

14:22.960 --> 14:27.040
 how, what kind of symmetries are enough to solve

14:27.040 --> 14:30.880
 the MNIST handwritten digit recognition problem

14:30.880 --> 14:32.320
 and write that down.

14:32.320 --> 14:33.880
 And exactly, and what's so fascinating

14:33.880 --> 14:35.440
 about the work in that direction

14:35.440 --> 14:38.320
 from the point of view of a mathematician like me

14:38.320 --> 14:42.560
 and a geometer is that the kind of groups of symmetries,

14:42.560 --> 14:45.960
 the types of symmetries that we know of are not sufficient.

14:45.960 --> 14:48.680
 So in other words, like we're just gonna keep on going

14:48.680 --> 14:49.740
 into the weeds on this.

14:51.320 --> 14:52.520
 The deeper, the better.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.320
 A kind of symmetry that we understand very well

14:55.320 --> 14:56.720
 is rotation.

14:56.720 --> 14:57.920
 So here's what would be easy.

14:57.920 --> 15:01.980
 If humans, if we recognize the digit as a one,

15:01.980 --> 15:03.640
 if it was like literally a rotation

15:03.640 --> 15:07.220
 by some number of degrees or some fixed one

15:07.220 --> 15:10.440
 in some typeface like Palatino or something,

15:10.440 --> 15:12.080
 that would be very easy to understand.

15:12.080 --> 15:13.960
 It would be very easy to like write a program

15:13.960 --> 15:17.400
 that could detect whether something was a rotation

15:17.400 --> 15:20.680
 of a fixed digit one.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.640
 Whatever we're doing when you recognize the digit one

15:22.640 --> 15:25.920
 and distinguish it from the digit two, it's not that.

15:25.920 --> 15:30.680
 It's not just incorporating one of the types of symmetries

15:30.680 --> 15:32.120
 that we understand.

15:32.120 --> 15:36.640
 Now, I would say that I would be shocked

15:36.640 --> 15:40.640
 if there was some kind of classical symmetry type formulation

15:40.640 --> 15:43.360
 that captured what we're doing

15:43.360 --> 15:45.600
 when we tell the difference between a two and a three.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.040
 To be honest, I think what we're doing

15:48.040 --> 15:50.240
 is actually more complicated than that.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.280
 I feel like it must be.

15:52.280 --> 15:53.680
 They're so simple, these numbers.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.840
 I mean, they're really geometric objects.

15:55.840 --> 15:58.600
 Like we can draw out one, two, three.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.160
 It does seem like it should be formalizable.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.280
 That's why it's so strange.

16:03.280 --> 16:04.220
 Do you think it's formalizable

16:04.220 --> 16:06.840
 when something stops being a two and starts being a three?

16:06.840 --> 16:09.000
 Right, you can imagine something continuously deforming

16:09.000 --> 16:11.120
 from being a two to a three.

16:11.120 --> 16:15.440
 Yeah, but that's, there is a moment.

16:15.440 --> 16:17.620
 Like I have myself written programs

16:17.620 --> 16:20.760
 that literally morph twos and threes and so on.

16:20.760 --> 16:23.960
 And you watch, and there is moments that you notice

16:23.960 --> 16:26.920
 depending on the trajectory of that transformation,

16:26.920 --> 16:31.920
 that morphing, that it is a three and a two.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.600
 There's a hard line.

16:33.600 --> 16:36.360
 Wait, so if you ask people, if you showed them this morph,

16:36.360 --> 16:37.360
 if you ask a bunch of people,

16:37.360 --> 16:39.800
 do they all agree about where the transition happened?

16:39.800 --> 16:40.760
 Because I would be surprised.

16:40.760 --> 16:41.600
 I think so.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.920
 Oh my God, okay, we have an empirical dispute.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.600
 But here's the problem.

16:44.600 --> 16:48.240
 Here's the problem, that if I just showed that moment

16:48.240 --> 16:50.680
 that I agreed on.

16:50.680 --> 16:51.720
 Well, that's not fair.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.480
 No, but say I said,

16:53.480 --> 16:55.080
 so I want to move away from the agreement

16:55.080 --> 16:57.320
 because that's a fascinating actually question

16:57.320 --> 17:02.320
 that I want to backtrack from because I just dogmatically

17:02.400 --> 17:04.840
 said, because I could be very, very wrong.

17:04.840 --> 17:09.840
 But the morphing really helps that like the change,

17:09.960 --> 17:11.880
 because I mean, partially it's because our perception

17:11.880 --> 17:15.040
 systems, see this, it's all probably tied in there.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.000
 Somehow the change from one to the other,

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
 like seeing the video of it allows you to pinpoint

17:21.000 --> 17:23.680
 the place where a two becomes a three much better.

17:23.680 --> 17:26.000
 If I just showed you one picture,

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
 I think you might really, really struggle.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.120
 You might call a seven.

17:32.120 --> 17:37.120
 I think there's something also that we don't often

17:38.280 --> 17:41.600
 think about, which is it's not just about the static image,

17:41.600 --> 17:43.960
 it's the transformation of the image,

17:43.960 --> 17:45.560
 or it's not a static shape,

17:45.560 --> 17:47.600
 it's the transformation of the shape.

17:47.600 --> 17:51.560
 There's something in the movement that seems to be

17:51.560 --> 17:53.320
 not just about our perception system,

17:53.320 --> 17:55.040
 but fundamental to our cognition,

17:55.040 --> 17:57.720
 like how we think about stuff.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.360
 Yeah, and that's part of geometry too.

18:00.360 --> 18:03.200
 And in fact, again, another insight of modern geometry

18:03.200 --> 18:06.040
 is this idea that maybe we would naively think

18:06.040 --> 18:08.320
 we're gonna study, I don't know,

18:08.320 --> 18:10.400
 like Poincare, we're gonna study the three body problem.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.440
 We're gonna study sort of like three objects in space

18:13.440 --> 18:15.240
 moving around subject only to the force

18:15.240 --> 18:17.560
 of each other's gravity, which sounds very simple, right?

18:17.560 --> 18:18.720
 And if you don't know about this problem,

18:18.720 --> 18:20.040
 you're probably like, okay, so you just like put it

18:20.040 --> 18:21.240
 in your computer and see what they do.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.080
 Well, guess what?

18:22.080 --> 18:25.080
 That's like a problem that Poincare won a huge prize for

18:25.080 --> 18:27.360
 like making the first real progress on in the 1880s.

18:27.360 --> 18:32.200
 And we still don't know that much about it 150 years later.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.800
 I mean, it's a humongous mystery.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.000
 You just opened the door and we're gonna walk right in

18:38.000 --> 18:40.840
 before we return to symmetry.

18:40.840 --> 18:44.840
 What's the, who's Poincare and what's this conjecture

18:44.840 --> 18:46.680
 that he came up with?

18:46.680 --> 18:48.560
 Why is it such a hard problem?

18:48.560 --> 18:52.120
 Okay, so Poincare, he ends up being a major figure

18:52.120 --> 18:54.200
 in the book and I didn't even really intend for him

18:54.200 --> 18:59.200
 to be such a big figure, but he's first and foremost

18:59.280 --> 19:00.120
 a geometer, right?

19:00.120 --> 19:02.600
 So he's a mathematician who kind of comes up

19:02.600 --> 19:07.600
 in late 19th century France at a time when French math

19:07.880 --> 19:09.360
 is really starting to flower.

19:09.360 --> 19:10.200
 Actually, I learned a lot.

19:10.200 --> 19:11.640
 I mean, in math, we're not really trained

19:11.640 --> 19:12.680
 on our own history.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.240
 We got a PhD in math, learned about math.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.200
 So I learned a lot.

19:15.200 --> 19:18.600
 There's this whole kind of moment where France

19:18.600 --> 19:22.040
 has just been beaten in the Franco Prussian war.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.840
 And they're like, oh my God, what did we do wrong?

19:23.840 --> 19:26.440
 And they were like, we gotta get strong in math

19:26.440 --> 19:27.280
 like the Germans.

19:27.280 --> 19:28.440
 We have to be like more like the Germans.

19:28.440 --> 19:29.880
 So this never happens to us again.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.960
 So it's very much, it's like the Sputnik moment,

19:31.960 --> 19:34.600
 like what happens in America in the 50s and 60s

19:34.600 --> 19:35.440
 with the Soviet Union.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.280
 This is happening to France and they're trying

19:37.280 --> 19:40.360
 to kind of like instantly like modernize.

19:40.360 --> 19:43.120
 That's fascinating that the humans and mathematics

19:43.120 --> 19:46.800
 are intricately connected to the history of humans.

19:46.800 --> 19:51.800
 The Cold War is I think fundamental to the way people

19:51.800 --> 19:55.160
 saw science and math in the Soviet Union.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.720
 I don't know if that was true in the United States,

19:56.720 --> 19:58.520
 but certainly it was in the Soviet Union.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.000
 It definitely was, and I would love to hear more

20:00.000 --> 20:01.560
 about how it was in the Soviet Union.

20:01.560 --> 20:04.960
 I mean, there was, and we'll talk about the Olympiad.

20:04.960 --> 20:08.720
 I just remember that there was this feeling

20:09.720 --> 20:14.320
 like the world hung in a balance

20:14.320 --> 20:19.320
 and you could save the world with the tools of science.

20:19.320 --> 20:24.320
 And mathematics was like the superpower that fuels science.

20:26.520 --> 20:30.240
 And so like people were seen as, you know,

20:30.240 --> 20:32.880
 people in America often idolize athletes,

20:32.880 --> 20:35.680
 but ultimately the best athletes in the world,

20:36.920 --> 20:40.000
 they just throw a ball into a basket.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.240
 So like there's not, what people really enjoy about sports,

20:44.240 --> 20:48.640
 I love sports, is like excellence at the highest level.

20:48.640 --> 20:51.320
 But when you take that with mathematics and science,

20:51.320 --> 20:54.280
 people also enjoyed excellence in science and mathematics

20:54.280 --> 20:56.880
 in the Soviet Union, but there's an extra sense

20:56.880 --> 21:00.320
 that that excellence would lead to a better world.

21:01.400 --> 21:06.400
 So that created all the usual things you think about

21:07.360 --> 21:12.160
 with the Olympics, which is like extreme competitiveness.

21:12.160 --> 21:15.120
 But it also created this sense that in the modern era

21:15.120 --> 21:19.400
 in America, somebody like Elon Musk, whatever you think

21:19.400 --> 21:21.480
 of him, like Jeff Bezos, those folks,

21:21.480 --> 21:24.480
 they inspire the possibility that one person

21:24.480 --> 21:27.040
 or a group of smart people can change the world.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.040
 Like not just be good at what they do,

21:29.040 --> 21:30.640
 but actually change the world.

21:30.640 --> 21:33.320
 Mathematics was at the core of that.

21:33.320 --> 21:36.040
 I don't know, there's a romanticism around it too.

21:36.040 --> 21:39.480
 Like when you read books about in America,

21:39.480 --> 21:42.640
 people romanticize certain things like baseball, for example.

21:42.640 --> 21:45.680
 There's like these beautiful poetic writing

21:45.680 --> 21:47.400
 about the game of baseball.

21:47.400 --> 21:50.640
 The same was the feeling with mathematics and science

21:50.640 --> 21:53.160
 in the Soviet Union, and it was in the air.

21:53.160 --> 21:57.280
 Everybody was forced to take high level mathematics courses.

21:57.280 --> 22:00.480
 Like you took a lot of math, you took a lot of science

22:00.480 --> 22:03.240
 and a lot of like really rigorous literature.

22:03.240 --> 22:06.560
 Like the level of education in Russia,

22:06.560 --> 22:09.200
 this could be true in China, I'm not sure,

22:09.200 --> 22:14.120
 in a lot of countries is in whatever that's called,

22:14.120 --> 22:18.760
 it's K to 12 in America, but like young people education.

22:18.760 --> 22:23.360
 The level they were challenged to learn at is incredible.

22:23.360 --> 22:27.960
 It's like America falls far behind, I would say.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.880
 America then quickly catches up

22:29.880 --> 22:33.880
 and then exceeds everybody else as you start approaching

22:33.880 --> 22:35.360
 the end of high school to college.

22:35.360 --> 22:37.040
 Like the university system in the United States

22:37.040 --> 22:39.280
 arguably is the best in the world.

22:39.280 --> 22:44.200
 But like what we challenge everybody,

22:44.200 --> 22:46.560
 it's not just like the good, the A students,

22:46.560 --> 22:50.200
 but everybody to learn in the Soviet Union was fascinating.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.080
 I think I'm gonna pick up on something you said.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.800
 I think you would love a book called

22:53.800 --> 22:56.360
 Dual at Dawn by Amir Alexander,

22:56.360 --> 22:58.440
 which I think some of the things you're responding to

22:58.440 --> 23:01.040
 and what I wrote, I think I first got turned on to

23:01.040 --> 23:02.880
 by Amir's work, he's a historian of math.

23:02.880 --> 23:06.040
 And he writes about the story of Everest to Galois,

23:06.040 --> 23:08.320
 which is a story that's well known to all mathematicians,

23:08.320 --> 23:12.880
 this kind of like very, very romantic figure

23:12.880 --> 23:17.880
 who he really sort of like begins the development of this

23:18.040 --> 23:20.120
 or this theory of groups that I mentioned earlier,

23:20.120 --> 23:22.400
 this general theory of symmetries

23:23.480 --> 23:25.520
 and then dies in a duel in his early 20s,

23:25.520 --> 23:28.400
 like all this stuff, mostly unpublished.

23:28.400 --> 23:31.120
 It's a very, very romantic story that we all learn.

23:32.400 --> 23:33.440
 And much of it is true,

23:33.440 --> 23:37.600
 but Alexander really lays out just how much

23:37.600 --> 23:40.480
 the way people thought about math in those times

23:40.480 --> 23:43.200
 in the early 19th century was wound up with,

23:43.200 --> 23:44.480
 as you say, romanticism.

23:44.480 --> 23:47.160
 I mean, that's when the romantic movement takes place

23:47.160 --> 23:51.200
 and he really outlines how people were predisposed

23:51.200 --> 23:52.800
 to think about mathematics in that way

23:52.800 --> 23:54.240
 because they thought about poetry that way

23:54.240 --> 23:55.680
 and they thought about music that way.

23:55.680 --> 23:58.240
 It was the mood of the era to think about

23:58.240 --> 23:59.920
 we're reaching for the transcendent,

23:59.920 --> 24:02.000
 we're sort of reaching for sort of direct contact

24:02.000 --> 24:02.840
 with the divine.

24:02.840 --> 24:06.040
 And part of the reason that we think of Gawa that way

24:06.040 --> 24:08.680
 was because Gawa himself was a creature of that era

24:08.680 --> 24:10.600
 and he romanticized himself.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.640
 I mean, now we know he wrote lots of letters

24:12.640 --> 24:14.880
 and he was kind of like, I mean, in modern terms,

24:14.880 --> 24:16.520
 we would say he was extremely emo.

24:16.520 --> 24:19.800
 Like we wrote all these letters

24:19.800 --> 24:21.320
 about his like florid feelings

24:21.320 --> 24:23.280
 and like the fire within him about the mathematics.

24:23.280 --> 24:26.280
 And so it's just as you say

24:26.280 --> 24:29.600
 that the math history touches human history.

24:29.600 --> 24:32.720
 They're never separate because math is made of people.

24:32.720 --> 24:35.560
 I mean, that's what, it's people who do it

24:35.560 --> 24:36.840
 and we're human beings doing it

24:36.840 --> 24:39.120
 and we do it within whatever community we're in

24:39.120 --> 24:42.640
 and we do it affected by the mores

24:42.640 --> 24:44.080
 of the society around us.

24:44.080 --> 24:47.360
 So the French, the Germans and Poincare.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.880
 Yes, okay, so back to Poincare.

24:48.880 --> 24:52.520
 So he's, you know, it's funny.

24:52.520 --> 24:55.880
 This book is filled with kind of mathematical characters

24:55.880 --> 25:00.080
 who often are kind of peevish or get into feuds

25:00.080 --> 25:03.840
 or sort of have like weird enthusiasms

25:03.840 --> 25:05.160
 because those people are fun to write about

25:05.160 --> 25:07.440
 and they sort of like say very salty things.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.560
 Poincare is actually none of this.

25:09.560 --> 25:12.440
 As far as I can tell, he was an extremely normal dude

25:12.440 --> 25:15.240
 who didn't get into fights with people

25:15.240 --> 25:16.280
 and everybody liked him

25:16.280 --> 25:18.040
 and he was like pretty personally modest

25:18.040 --> 25:20.240
 and he had very regular habits.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.080
 You know what I mean?

25:21.080 --> 25:23.760
 He did math for like four hours in the morning

25:23.760 --> 25:25.640
 and four hours in the evening and that was it.

25:25.640 --> 25:28.200
 Like he had his schedule.

25:28.200 --> 25:31.640
 I actually, it was like, I still am feeling like

25:31.640 --> 25:33.360
 somebody's gonna tell me now that the book is out,

25:33.360 --> 25:34.720
 like, oh, didn't you know about this

25:34.720 --> 25:37.000
 like incredibly sordid episode?

25:37.000 --> 25:39.920
 As far as I could tell, a completely normal guy.

25:39.920 --> 25:44.280
 But he just kind of, in many ways,

25:44.280 --> 25:47.760
 creates the geometric world in which we live

25:47.760 --> 25:52.760
 and his first really big success is this prize paper

25:53.360 --> 25:55.960
 he writes for this prize offered by the King of Sweden

25:55.960 --> 25:59.520
 for the study of the three body problem.

26:01.080 --> 26:04.240
 The study of what we can say about, yeah,

26:04.240 --> 26:07.280
 three astronomical objects moving

26:07.280 --> 26:09.080
 in what you might think would be this very simple way.

26:09.080 --> 26:12.240
 Nothing's going on except gravity.

26:12.240 --> 26:13.640
 So what's the three body problem?

26:13.640 --> 26:15.000
 Why is it a problem?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.800
 So the problem is to understand

26:16.800 --> 26:20.000
 when this motion is stable and when it's not.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.840
 So stable meaning they would sort of like end up

26:21.840 --> 26:23.600
 in some kind of periodic orbit.

26:23.600 --> 26:25.400
 Or I guess it would mean, sorry,

26:25.400 --> 26:26.960
 stable would mean they never sort of fly off

26:26.960 --> 26:28.040
 far apart from each other.

26:28.040 --> 26:30.160
 And unstable would mean like eventually they fly apart.

26:30.160 --> 26:32.880
 So understanding two bodies is much easier.

26:32.880 --> 26:33.720
 Yes, exactly.

26:33.720 --> 26:36.480
 When you have the third wheel is always a problem.

26:36.480 --> 26:37.320
 This is what Newton knew.

26:37.320 --> 26:38.760
 Two bodies, they sort of orbit each other

26:38.760 --> 26:41.280
 in some kind of either in an ellipse,

26:41.280 --> 26:42.240
 which is the stable case.

26:42.240 --> 26:45.240
 You know, that's what the planets do that we know.

26:46.400 --> 26:49.400
 Or one travels on a hyperbola around the other.

26:49.400 --> 26:50.320
 That's the unstable case.

26:50.320 --> 26:51.920
 It sort of like zooms in from far away,

26:51.920 --> 26:54.280
 sort of like whips around the heavier thing

26:54.280 --> 26:56.720
 and like zooms out.

26:56.720 --> 26:58.120
 Those are basically the two options.

26:58.120 --> 27:00.840
 So it's a very simple and easy to classify story.

27:00.840 --> 27:04.160
 With three bodies, just the small switch from two to three,

27:04.160 --> 27:05.200
 it's a complete zoo.

27:05.200 --> 27:07.000
 It's the first, what we would say now

27:07.000 --> 27:09.920
 is it's the first example of what's called chaotic dynamics,

27:09.920 --> 27:13.000
 where the stable solutions and the unstable solutions,

27:13.000 --> 27:14.480
 they're kind of like wound in among each other.

27:14.480 --> 27:17.640
 And a very, very, very tiny change in the initial conditions

27:17.640 --> 27:20.200
 can make the longterm behavior of the system

27:20.200 --> 27:21.200
 completely different.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.960
 So Poincare was the first to recognize

27:22.960 --> 27:27.000
 that that phenomenon even existed.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.120
 What about the conjecture that carries his name?

27:31.120 --> 27:36.120
 Right, so he also was one of the pioneers

27:36.880 --> 27:41.440
 of taking geometry, which until that point

27:41.440 --> 27:44.080
 had been largely the study of two

27:44.080 --> 27:45.240
 and three dimensional objects,

27:45.240 --> 27:47.480
 because that's like what we see, right?

27:47.480 --> 27:49.680
 That's those are the objects we interact with.

27:49.680 --> 27:53.560
 He developed the subject we now called topology.

27:53.560 --> 27:55.320
 He called it analysis situs.

27:55.320 --> 27:57.840
 He was a very well spoken guy with a lot of slogans,

27:57.840 --> 27:59.600
 but that name did not,

27:59.600 --> 28:01.120
 you can see why that name did not catch on.

28:01.120 --> 28:03.320
 So now it's called topology now.

28:05.080 --> 28:06.280
 Sorry, what was it called before?

28:06.280 --> 28:09.360
 Analysis situs, which I guess sort of roughly means

28:09.360 --> 28:11.680
 like the analysis of location or something like that.

28:11.680 --> 28:14.160
 Like it's a Latin phrase.

28:14.160 --> 28:19.160
 Partly because he understood that even to understand

28:19.800 --> 28:22.480
 stuff that's going on in our physical world,

28:22.480 --> 28:24.400
 you have to study higher dimensional spaces.

28:24.400 --> 28:25.520
 How does this work?

28:25.520 --> 28:27.480
 And this is kind of like where my brain went to it

28:27.480 --> 28:29.880
 because you were talking about not just where things are,

28:29.880 --> 28:31.720
 but what their path is, how they're moving

28:31.720 --> 28:34.840
 when we were talking about the path from two to three.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.240
 He understood that if you wanna study

28:36.240 --> 28:39.600
 three bodies moving in space,

28:39.600 --> 28:44.040
 well, each body, it has a location where it is.

28:44.040 --> 28:45.920
 So it has an X coordinate, a Y coordinate,

28:45.920 --> 28:46.760
 a Z coordinate, right?

28:46.760 --> 28:49.440
 I can specify a point in space by giving you three numbers,

28:49.440 --> 28:52.120
 but it also at each moment has a velocity.

28:53.400 --> 28:56.520
 So it turns out that really to understand what's going on,

28:56.520 --> 28:58.920
 you can't think of it as a point or you could,

28:58.920 --> 29:01.040
 but it's better not to think of it as a point

29:01.040 --> 29:03.280
 in three dimensional space that's moving.

29:03.280 --> 29:04.440
 It's better to think of it as a point

29:04.440 --> 29:06.360
 in six dimensional space where the coordinates

29:06.360 --> 29:09.320
 are where is it and what's its velocity right now.

29:09.320 --> 29:11.800
 That's a higher dimensional space called phase space.

29:11.800 --> 29:13.200
 And if you haven't thought about this before,

29:13.200 --> 29:15.920
 I admit that it's a little bit mind bending,

29:15.920 --> 29:20.720
 but what he needed then was a geometry

29:20.720 --> 29:22.720
 that was flexible enough,

29:22.720 --> 29:24.520
 not just to talk about two dimensional spaces

29:24.520 --> 29:27.440
 or three dimensional spaces, but any dimensional space.

29:27.440 --> 29:29.320
 So the sort of famous first line of this paper

29:29.320 --> 29:30.800
 where he introduces analysis of Cetus

29:30.800 --> 29:34.280
 is no one doubts nowadays that the geometry

29:34.280 --> 29:37.720
 of n dimensional space is an actually existing thing, right?

29:37.720 --> 29:39.600
 I think that maybe that had been controversial.

29:39.600 --> 29:41.360
 And he's saying like, look, let's face it,

29:41.360 --> 29:44.040
 just because it's not physical doesn't mean it's not there.

29:44.040 --> 29:46.000
 It doesn't mean we shouldn't study it.

29:46.000 --> 29:46.920
 Interesting.

29:46.920 --> 29:49.760
 He wasn't jumping to the physical interpretation.

29:49.760 --> 29:51.640
 Like it can be real,

29:51.640 --> 29:55.720
 even if it's not perceivable to the human cognition.

29:55.720 --> 29:56.880
 I think that's right.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.400
 I think, don't get me wrong,

29:58.400 --> 30:00.280
 Poincare never strays far from physics.

30:00.280 --> 30:02.120
 He's always motivated by physics,

30:02.120 --> 30:06.200
 but the physics drove him to need to think about spaces

30:06.200 --> 30:07.240
 of higher dimension.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.440
 And so he needed a formalism that was rich enough

30:09.440 --> 30:10.520
 to enable him to do that.

30:10.520 --> 30:11.560
 And once you do that,

30:11.560 --> 30:13.600
 that formalism is also gonna include things

30:13.600 --> 30:14.680
 that are not physical.

30:14.680 --> 30:15.600
 And then you have two choices.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.760
 You can be like, oh, well, that stuff's trash.

30:17.760 --> 30:21.320
 Or, and this is more of the mathematicians frame of mind,

30:21.320 --> 30:23.680
 if you have a formalistic framework

30:23.680 --> 30:24.920
 that like seems really good

30:24.920 --> 30:27.200
 and sort of seems to be like very elegant and work well,

30:27.200 --> 30:29.040
 and it includes all the physical stuff,

30:29.040 --> 30:30.560
 maybe we should think about all of it.

30:30.560 --> 30:31.400
 Like maybe we should think about it,

30:31.400 --> 30:34.520
 thinking maybe there's some gold to be mined there.

30:34.520 --> 30:36.640
 And indeed, like, you know, guess what?

30:36.640 --> 30:39.120
 Like before long there's relativity and there's space time.

30:39.120 --> 30:40.080
 And like all of a sudden it's like,

30:40.080 --> 30:41.560
 oh yeah, maybe it's a good idea.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.880
 We already had this geometric apparatus like set up

30:43.880 --> 30:47.240
 for like how to think about four dimensional spaces,

30:47.240 --> 30:48.600
 like turns out they're real after all.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.680
 As I said, you know, this is a story much told

30:51.680 --> 30:53.080
 right in mathematics, not just in this context,

30:53.080 --> 30:53.920
 but in many.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.640
 I'd love to dig in a little deeper on that actually,

30:55.640 --> 31:00.640
 cause I have some intuitions to work out.

31:00.800 --> 31:01.800
 Okay.

31:01.800 --> 31:02.640
 My brain.

31:02.640 --> 31:03.560
 Well, I'm not a mathematical physicist,

31:03.560 --> 31:05.600
 so we can work them out together.

31:05.600 --> 31:06.440
 Good.

31:06.440 --> 31:10.000
 We'll together walk along the path of curiosity,

31:10.000 --> 31:13.720
 but Poincare conjecture.

31:13.720 --> 31:14.560
 What is it?

31:14.560 --> 31:17.320
 The Poincare conjecture is about curved

31:17.320 --> 31:18.880
 three dimensional spaces.

31:18.880 --> 31:21.240
 So I was on my way there.

31:21.240 --> 31:22.080
 I promise.

31:23.360 --> 31:26.700
 The idea is that we perceive ourselves as living in,

31:27.580 --> 31:29.160
 we don't say a three dimensional space.

31:29.160 --> 31:30.280
 We just say three dimensional space.

31:30.280 --> 31:31.480
 You know, you can go up and down,

31:31.480 --> 31:32.320
 you can go left and right,

31:32.320 --> 31:33.200
 you can go forward and back.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.480
 There's three dimensions in which we can move.

31:35.480 --> 31:36.600
 In Poincare's theory,

31:36.600 --> 31:41.600
 there are many possible three dimensional spaces.

31:41.680 --> 31:45.320
 In the same way that going down one dimension

31:45.320 --> 31:48.420
 to sort of capture our intuition a little bit more,

31:48.420 --> 31:49.700
 we know there are lots of different

31:49.700 --> 31:51.080
 two dimensional surfaces, right?

31:51.080 --> 31:54.080
 There's a balloon and that looks one way

31:54.080 --> 31:55.520
 and a donut looks another way

31:55.520 --> 31:57.640
 and a Mobius strip looks a third way.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.120
 Those are all like two dimensional surfaces

31:59.120 --> 32:02.360
 that we can kind of really get a global view of

32:02.360 --> 32:03.900
 because we live in three dimensional space.

32:03.900 --> 32:05.500
 So we can see a two dimensional surface

32:05.500 --> 32:07.200
 sort of sitting in our three dimensional space.

32:07.200 --> 32:11.260
 Well, to see a three dimensional space whole,

32:11.260 --> 32:13.220
 we'd have to kind of have four dimensional eyes, right?

32:13.220 --> 32:14.060
 Which we don't.

32:14.060 --> 32:15.020
 So we have to use our mathematical eyes.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.020
 We have to envision.

32:17.440 --> 32:22.080
 The Poincare conjecture says that there's a very simple way

32:22.080 --> 32:24.480
 to determine whether a three dimensional space

32:26.480 --> 32:29.640
 is the standard one, the one that we're used to.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.880
 And essentially it's that it's what's called

32:31.880 --> 32:34.640
 fundamental group has nothing interesting in it.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.040
 And that I can actually say without saying

32:36.040 --> 32:36.960
 what the fundamental group is,

32:36.960 --> 32:39.000
 I can tell you what the criterion is.

32:39.000 --> 32:39.840
 This would be good.

32:39.840 --> 32:40.880
 Oh, look, I can even use a visual aid.

32:40.880 --> 32:42.360
 So for the people watching this on YouTube,

32:42.360 --> 32:45.240
 you will just see this for the people on the podcast,

32:45.240 --> 32:46.160
 you'll have to visualize it.

32:46.160 --> 32:49.120
 So Lex has been nice enough to like give me a surface

32:49.120 --> 32:50.400
 with an interesting topology.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.320
 It's a mug right here in front of me.

32:52.320 --> 32:53.360
 A mug, yes.

32:53.360 --> 32:55.140
 I might say it's a genus one surface,

32:55.140 --> 32:57.280
 but we could also say it's a mug, same thing.

32:58.580 --> 33:03.000
 So if I were to draw a little circle on this mug,

33:03.000 --> 33:04.360
 which way should I draw it so it's visible?

33:04.360 --> 33:06.280
 Like here, okay.

33:06.280 --> 33:07.520
 If I draw a little circle on this mug,

33:07.520 --> 33:09.380
 imagine this to be a loop of string.

33:09.380 --> 33:12.080
 I could pull that loop of string closed

33:12.080 --> 33:14.640
 on the surface of the mug, right?

33:14.640 --> 33:15.880
 That's definitely something I could do.

33:15.880 --> 33:18.360
 I could shrink it, shrink it, shrink it until it's a point.

33:18.360 --> 33:19.200
 On the other hand,

33:19.200 --> 33:21.840
 if I draw a loop that goes around the handle,

33:21.840 --> 33:23.100
 I can kind of zhuzh it up here

33:23.100 --> 33:24.040
 and I can zhuzh it down there

33:24.040 --> 33:25.640
 and I can sort of slide it up and down the handle,

33:25.640 --> 33:27.300
 but I can't pull it closed, can I?

33:27.300 --> 33:28.840
 It's trapped.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.680
 Not without breaking the surface of the mug, right?

33:30.680 --> 33:32.380
 Not without like going inside.

33:32.380 --> 33:37.160
 So the condition of being what's called simply connected,

33:37.160 --> 33:39.840
 this is one of Poincare's inventions,

33:39.840 --> 33:42.640
 says that any loop of string can be pulled shut.

33:42.640 --> 33:45.120
 So it's a feature that the mug simply does not have.

33:45.120 --> 33:48.540
 This is a non simply connected mug

33:48.540 --> 33:51.120
 and a simply connected mug would be a cup, right?

33:51.120 --> 33:53.600
 You would burn your hand when you drank coffee out of it.

33:53.600 --> 33:56.520
 So you're saying the universe is not a mug.

33:56.520 --> 33:59.360
 Well, I can't speak to the universe,

33:59.360 --> 34:04.360
 but what I can say is that regular old space is not a mug.

34:05.320 --> 34:06.160
 Regular old space,

34:06.160 --> 34:07.840
 if you like sort of actually physically have

34:07.840 --> 34:09.600
 like a loop of string,

34:09.600 --> 34:11.000
 you can pull it shut.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.660
 You can always pull it shut.

34:12.660 --> 34:14.060
 But what if your piece of string

34:14.060 --> 34:14.980
 was the size of the universe?

34:14.980 --> 34:16.340
 Like what if your piece of string

34:16.340 --> 34:18.120
 was like billions of light years long?

34:18.120 --> 34:20.180
 Like how do you actually know?

34:20.180 --> 34:21.480
 I mean, that's still an open question

34:21.480 --> 34:22.560
 of the shape of the universe.

34:22.560 --> 34:23.400
 Exactly.

34:25.520 --> 34:26.480
 I think there's a lot,

34:26.480 --> 34:28.620
 there is ideas of it being a torus.

34:28.620 --> 34:30.400
 I mean, there's some trippy ideas

34:30.400 --> 34:33.440
 and they're not like weird out there controversial.

34:33.440 --> 34:38.160
 There's legitimate at the center of a cosmology debate.

34:38.160 --> 34:40.000
 I mean, I think most people think it's flat.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.160
 I think there's some kind of dodecahedral symmetry

34:42.160 --> 34:43.600
 or I mean, I remember reading something crazy

34:43.600 --> 34:45.920
 about somebody saying that they saw the signature of that

34:45.920 --> 34:48.520
 in the cosmic noise or what have you.

34:48.520 --> 34:49.800
 I mean.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.380
 To make the flat earthers happy,

34:51.380 --> 34:56.380
 I do believe that the current main belief is it's flat.

34:56.380 --> 34:59.820
 It's flat ish or something like that.

34:59.820 --> 35:01.980
 The shape of the universe is flat ish.

35:01.980 --> 35:03.140
 I don't know what the heck that means.

35:03.140 --> 35:05.700
 I think that has like a very,

35:06.660 --> 35:09.900
 how are you even supposed to think about the shape

35:09.900 --> 35:14.140
 of a thing that doesn't have any thing outside of it?

35:14.140 --> 35:14.980
 I mean.

35:14.980 --> 35:16.740
 Ah, but that's exactly what topology does.

35:16.740 --> 35:19.420
 Topology is what's called an intrinsic theory.

35:19.420 --> 35:20.340
 That's what's so great about it.

35:20.340 --> 35:22.580
 This question about the mug,

35:22.580 --> 35:26.000
 you could answer it without ever leaving the mug, right?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.980
 Because it's a question about a loop drawn

35:28.980 --> 35:29.980
 on the surface of the mug

35:29.980 --> 35:31.820
 and what happens if it never leaves that surface.

35:31.820 --> 35:33.500
 So it's like always there.

35:33.500 --> 35:37.820
 See, but that's the difference between the topology

35:37.820 --> 35:42.480
 and say, if you're like trying to visualize a mug,

35:42.480 --> 35:45.580
 that you can't visualize a mug while living inside the mug.

35:46.660 --> 35:47.500
 Well, that's true.

35:47.500 --> 35:49.180
 The visualization is harder, but in some sense,

35:49.180 --> 35:50.000
 no, you're right.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.980
 But if the tools of mathematics are there,

35:51.980 --> 35:53.700
 I, sorry, I don't want to fight,

35:53.700 --> 35:55.580
 but I think the tools of mathematics are exactly there

35:55.580 --> 35:56.980
 to enable you to think about

35:56.980 --> 35:58.700
 what you cannot visualize in this way.

35:58.700 --> 36:00.740
 Let me give, let's go, always to make things easier,

36:00.740 --> 36:01.780
 go down to dimension.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.780
 Let's think about we live in a circle, okay?

36:05.780 --> 36:10.780
 You can tell whether you live on a circle or a line segment,

36:11.260 --> 36:12.340
 because if you live in a circle,

36:12.340 --> 36:13.800
 if you walk a long way in one direction,

36:13.800 --> 36:15.220
 you find yourself back where you started.

36:15.220 --> 36:17.300
 And if you live in a line segment,

36:17.300 --> 36:18.740
 you walk for a long enough one direction,

36:18.740 --> 36:20.180
 you come to the end of the world.

36:20.180 --> 36:22.900
 Or if you live on a line, like a whole line,

36:22.900 --> 36:25.860
 infinite line, then you walk in one direction

36:25.860 --> 36:27.080
 for a long time and like,

36:27.080 --> 36:28.720
 well, then there's not a sort of terminating algorithm

36:28.720 --> 36:30.460
 to figure out whether you live on a line or a circle,

36:30.460 --> 36:31.660
 but at least you sort of,

36:33.340 --> 36:35.680
 at least you don't discover that you live on a circle.

36:35.680 --> 36:37.360
 So all of those are intrinsic things, right?

36:37.360 --> 36:39.700
 All of those are things that you can figure out

36:39.700 --> 36:42.060
 about your world without leaving your world.

36:42.060 --> 36:43.300
 On the other hand, ready?

36:43.300 --> 36:45.220
 Now we're going to go from intrinsic to extrinsic.

36:45.220 --> 36:46.920
 Boy, did I not know we were going to talk about this,

36:46.920 --> 36:48.020
 but why not?

36:48.020 --> 36:48.860
 Why not?

36:48.860 --> 36:52.500
 If you can't tell whether you live in a circle

36:52.500 --> 36:55.580
 or a knot, like imagine like a knot

36:55.580 --> 36:56.900
 floating in three dimensional space.

36:56.900 --> 36:59.660
 The person who lives on that knot, to them it's a circle.

36:59.660 --> 37:01.740
 They walk a long way, they come back to where they started.

37:01.740 --> 37:04.280
 Now we, with our three dimensional eyes can be like,

37:04.280 --> 37:05.580
 oh, this one's just a plain circle

37:05.580 --> 37:06.700
 and this one's knotted up,

37:06.700 --> 37:09.700
 but that has to do with how they sit

37:09.700 --> 37:10.620
 in three dimensional space.

37:10.620 --> 37:12.120
 It doesn't have to do with intrinsic features

37:12.120 --> 37:13.120
 of those people's world.

37:13.120 --> 37:14.880
 We can ask you one ape to another.

37:14.880 --> 37:17.120
 Does it make you, how does it make you feel

37:17.120 --> 37:19.860
 that you don't know if you live in a circle

37:19.860 --> 37:22.740
 or on a knot, in a knot,

37:24.460 --> 37:26.760
 inside the string that forms the knot?

37:28.680 --> 37:29.940
 I don't even know how to say that.

37:29.940 --> 37:30.940
 I'm going to be honest with you.

37:30.940 --> 37:34.580
 I don't know if, I fear you won't like this answer,

37:34.580 --> 37:37.140
 but it does not bother me at all.

37:37.140 --> 37:39.380
 I don't lose one minute of sleep over it.

37:39.380 --> 37:41.700
 So like, does it bother you that if we look

37:41.700 --> 37:46.100
 at like a Mobius strip, that you don't have an obvious way

37:46.100 --> 37:49.740
 of knowing whether you are inside of a cylinder,

37:49.740 --> 37:51.780
 if you live on a surface of a cylinder

37:51.780 --> 37:54.020
 or you live on the surface of a Mobius strip?

37:55.700 --> 37:58.740
 No, I think you can tell if you live.

37:58.740 --> 37:59.580
 Which one?

37:59.580 --> 38:02.500
 Because what you do is you like tell your friend,

38:02.500 --> 38:04.140
 hey, stay right here, I'm just going to go for a walk.

38:04.140 --> 38:06.700
 And then you like walk for a long time in one direction

38:06.700 --> 38:08.260
 and then you come back and you see your friend again.

38:08.260 --> 38:09.380
 And if your friend is reversed,

38:09.380 --> 38:10.740
 then you know you live on a Mobius strip.

38:10.740 --> 38:13.860
 Well, no, because you won't see your friend, right?

38:13.860 --> 38:17.060
 Okay, fair point, fair point on that.

38:17.060 --> 38:19.820
 But you have to believe the stories about,

38:19.820 --> 38:24.220
 no, I don't even know, would you even know?

38:24.220 --> 38:25.100
 Would you really?

38:25.100 --> 38:26.860
 Oh, no, your point is right.

38:26.860 --> 38:28.220
 Let me try to think of a better,

38:28.220 --> 38:29.420
 let's see if I can do this on the fly.

38:29.420 --> 38:33.900
 It may not be correct to talk about cognitive beings

38:33.900 --> 38:35.380
 living on a Mobius strip

38:35.380 --> 38:37.940
 because there's a lot of things taken for granted there.

38:37.940 --> 38:39.820
 And we're constantly imagining actual

38:39.820 --> 38:42.300
 like three dimensional creatures,

38:42.300 --> 38:47.300
 like how it actually feels like to live in a Mobius strip

38:47.940 --> 38:50.140
 is tricky to internalize.

38:50.140 --> 38:52.860
 I think that on what's called the real protective plane,

38:52.860 --> 38:54.900
 which is kind of even more sort of like messed up version

38:54.900 --> 38:57.540
 of the Mobius strip, but with very similar features,

38:57.540 --> 39:01.340
 this feature of kind of like only having one side,

39:01.340 --> 39:04.500
 that has the feature that there's a loop of string

39:04.500 --> 39:06.740
 which can't be pulled closed.

39:06.740 --> 39:09.700
 But if you loop it around twice along the same path,

39:09.700 --> 39:11.300
 that you can pull closed.

39:11.300 --> 39:12.980
 That's extremely weird.

39:12.980 --> 39:13.820
 Yeah.

39:14.860 --> 39:16.260
 But that would be a way you could know

39:16.260 --> 39:17.260
 without leaving your world

39:17.260 --> 39:20.380
 that something very funny is going on.

39:20.380 --> 39:21.980
 You know what's extremely weird?

39:21.980 --> 39:23.260
 Maybe we can comment on,

39:23.260 --> 39:25.460
 hopefully it's not too much of a tangent is,

39:26.900 --> 39:29.020
 I remember thinking about this,

39:29.020 --> 39:31.820
 this might be right, this might be wrong.

39:31.820 --> 39:34.580
 But if we now talk about a sphere

39:35.460 --> 39:37.580
 and you're living inside a sphere,

39:37.580 --> 39:41.180
 that you're going to see everywhere around you,

39:41.180 --> 39:42.660
 the back of your own head.

39:44.820 --> 39:46.140
 That I was,

39:46.140 --> 39:47.980
 cause like I was,

39:47.980 --> 39:50.820
 this is very counterintuitive to me to think about,

39:50.820 --> 39:51.660
 maybe it's wrong.

39:51.660 --> 39:54.260
 But cause I was thinking of like earth,

39:54.260 --> 39:57.260
 your 3D thing sitting on a sphere.

39:57.260 --> 39:59.260
 But if you're living inside the sphere,

40:00.140 --> 40:02.300
 like you're going to see, if you look straight,

40:02.300 --> 40:05.580
 you're always going to see yourself all the way around.

40:05.580 --> 40:07.620
 So everywhere you look, there's going to be

40:07.620 --> 40:09.300
 the back of your own head.

40:09.300 --> 40:10.980
 I think somehow this depends on something

40:10.980 --> 40:13.180
 of like how the physics of light works in this scenario,

40:13.180 --> 40:14.820
 which I'm sort of finding it hard to bend my.

40:14.820 --> 40:15.660
 That's true.

40:15.660 --> 40:16.660
 The sea is doing a lot of work.

40:16.660 --> 40:19.540
 Like saying you see something is doing a lot of work.

40:19.540 --> 40:20.740
 People have thought about this a lot.

40:20.740 --> 40:22.340
 I mean, this metaphor of like,

40:22.340 --> 40:24.740
 what if we're like little creatures

40:24.740 --> 40:26.100
 in some sort of smaller world?

40:26.100 --> 40:27.700
 Like how could we apprehend what's outside?

40:27.700 --> 40:29.580
 That metaphor just comes back and back.

40:29.580 --> 40:32.140
 And actually I didn't even realize like how frequent it is.

40:32.140 --> 40:33.540
 It comes up in the book a lot.

40:33.540 --> 40:35.620
 I know it from a book called Flatland.

40:35.620 --> 40:37.780
 I don't know if you ever read this when you were a kid.

40:37.780 --> 40:38.620
 A while ago, yeah.

40:38.620 --> 40:39.460
 An adult.

40:39.460 --> 40:42.900
 You know, this sort of comic novel from the 19th century

40:42.900 --> 40:46.940
 about an entire two dimensional world.

40:46.940 --> 40:48.260
 It's narrated by a square.

40:48.260 --> 40:49.820
 That's the main character.

40:49.820 --> 40:53.580
 And the kind of strangeness that befalls him

40:53.580 --> 40:55.220
 when one day he's in his house

40:55.220 --> 40:57.860
 and suddenly there's like a little circle there

40:57.860 --> 40:59.220
 and they're with him.

40:59.220 --> 41:02.460
 But then the circle like starts getting bigger

41:02.460 --> 41:04.340
 and bigger and bigger.

41:04.340 --> 41:06.020
 And he's like, what the hell is going on?

41:06.020 --> 41:08.500
 It's like a horror movie, like for two dimensional people.

41:08.500 --> 41:09.820
 And of course what's happening

41:09.820 --> 41:12.140
 is that a sphere is entering his world.

41:12.140 --> 41:15.060
 And as the sphere kind of like moves farther and farther

41:15.060 --> 41:16.700
 into the plane, it's cross section.

41:16.700 --> 41:18.420
 The part of it that he can see.

41:18.420 --> 41:20.140
 To him, it looks like there's like this kind

41:20.140 --> 41:22.420
 of bizarre being that's like getting larger

41:22.420 --> 41:23.500
 and larger and larger

41:24.700 --> 41:27.300
 until it's exactly sort of halfway through.

41:27.300 --> 41:29.140
 And then they have this kind of like philosophical argument

41:29.140 --> 41:30.180
 where the sphere is like, I'm a sphere.

41:30.180 --> 41:31.020
 I'm from the third dimension.

41:31.020 --> 41:32.220
 The square is like, what are you talking about?

41:32.220 --> 41:33.380
 There's no such thing.

41:33.380 --> 41:36.220
 And they have this kind of like sterile argument

41:36.220 --> 41:39.140
 where the square is not able to kind of like

41:39.140 --> 41:40.980
 follow the mathematical reasoning of the sphere

41:40.980 --> 41:42.380
 until the sphere just kind of grabs him

41:42.380 --> 41:45.820
 and like jerks him out of the plane and pulls him up.

41:45.820 --> 41:47.380
 And it's like now, like now do you see,

41:47.380 --> 41:50.260
 like now do you see your whole world

41:50.260 --> 41:52.100
 that you didn't understand before?

41:52.100 --> 41:55.500
 So do you think that kind of process is possible

41:55.500 --> 41:56.580
 for us humans?

41:56.580 --> 41:58.380
 So we live in the three dimensional world,

41:58.380 --> 42:01.520
 maybe with the time component four dimensional

42:01.520 --> 42:06.520
 and then math allows us to go high,

42:06.620 --> 42:08.220
 into high dimensions comfortably

42:08.220 --> 42:10.460
 and explore the world from those perspectives.

42:13.580 --> 42:18.580
 Like, is it possible that the universe

42:19.620 --> 42:23.060
 is many more dimensions than the ones

42:23.060 --> 42:25.180
 we experience as human beings?

42:25.180 --> 42:28.820
 So if you look at the, you know,

42:28.820 --> 42:32.020
 especially in physics theories of everything,

42:32.020 --> 42:35.380
 physics theories that try to unify general relativity

42:35.380 --> 42:37.400
 and quantum field theory,

42:37.400 --> 42:42.400
 they seem to go to high dimensions to work stuff out

42:42.660 --> 42:44.620
 through the tools of mathematics.

42:44.620 --> 42:46.140
 Is it possible?

42:46.140 --> 42:47.700
 So like the two options are,

42:47.700 --> 42:51.500
 one is just a nice way to analyze a universe,

42:51.500 --> 42:54.740
 but the reality is, is as exactly we perceive it,

42:54.740 --> 42:58.620
 it is three dimensional, or are we just seeing,

42:58.620 --> 43:00.740
 are we those flatland creatures

43:00.740 --> 43:03.740
 that are just seeing a tiny slice of reality

43:03.740 --> 43:08.740
 and the actual reality is many, many, many more dimensions

43:08.860 --> 43:10.960
 than the three dimensions we perceive?

43:10.960 --> 43:12.860
 Oh, I certainly think that's possible.

43:14.580 --> 43:17.900
 Now, how would you figure out whether it was true or not

43:17.900 --> 43:18.960
 is another question.

43:20.440 --> 43:22.180
 And I suppose what you would do

43:22.180 --> 43:25.060
 as with anything else that you can't directly perceive

43:25.060 --> 43:29.380
 is you would try to understand

43:29.380 --> 43:32.100
 what effect the presence of those extra dimensions

43:33.220 --> 43:36.940
 out there would have on the things we can perceive.

43:36.940 --> 43:39.180
 Like what else can you do, right?

43:39.180 --> 43:42.260
 And in some sense, if the answer is

43:42.260 --> 43:44.720
 they would have no effect,

43:44.720 --> 43:46.180
 then maybe it becomes like a little bit

43:46.180 --> 43:47.020
 of a sterile question,

43:47.020 --> 43:49.340
 because what question are you even asking, right?

43:49.340 --> 43:53.740
 You can kind of posit however many entities that you want.

43:53.740 --> 43:56.900
 Is it possible to intuit how to mess

43:56.900 --> 43:58.240
 with the other dimensions

43:58.240 --> 44:00.320
 while living in a three dimensional world?

44:00.320 --> 44:03.020
 I mean, that seems like a very challenging thing to do.

44:03.860 --> 44:06.040
 The reason flatland could be written

44:06.900 --> 44:11.420
 is because it's coming from a three dimensional writer.

44:11.420 --> 44:13.880
 Yes, but what happens in the book,

44:13.880 --> 44:15.220
 I didn't even tell you the whole plot.

44:15.220 --> 44:17.220
 What happens is the square is so excited

44:17.220 --> 44:19.960
 and so filled with intellectual joy.

44:19.960 --> 44:22.200
 By the way, maybe to give the story some context,

44:22.200 --> 44:25.180
 you asked like, is it possible for us humans

44:25.180 --> 44:28.460
 to have this experience of being transcendentally jerked

44:28.460 --> 44:30.980
 out of our world so we can sort of truly see it from above?

44:30.980 --> 44:32.760
 Well, Edwin Abbott who wrote the book

44:32.760 --> 44:35.940
 certainly thought so because Edwin Abbott was a minister.

44:35.940 --> 44:37.880
 So the whole Christian subtext of this book,

44:37.880 --> 44:41.840
 I had completely not grasped reading this as a kid,

44:41.840 --> 44:43.420
 that it means a very different thing, right?

44:43.420 --> 44:45.700
 If sort of a theologian is saying like,

44:45.700 --> 44:48.220
 oh, what if a higher being could like pull you out

44:48.220 --> 44:50.000
 of this earthly world you live in

44:50.000 --> 44:51.360
 so that you can sort of see the truth

44:51.360 --> 44:54.460
 and like really see it from above as it were.

44:54.460 --> 44:56.500
 So that's one of the things that's going on for him.

44:56.500 --> 44:58.420
 And it's a testament to his skill as a writer

44:58.420 --> 45:01.760
 that his story just works whether that's the framework

45:01.760 --> 45:05.220
 you're coming to it from or not.

45:05.220 --> 45:07.500
 But what happens in this book and this part,

45:07.500 --> 45:08.980
 now looking at it through a Christian lens,

45:08.980 --> 45:13.240
 it becomes a bit subversive is the square is so excited

45:13.240 --> 45:16.780
 about what he's learned from the sphere

45:16.780 --> 45:18.740
 and the sphere explains to him like what a cube would be.

45:18.740 --> 45:20.020
 Oh, it's like you but three dimensional

45:20.020 --> 45:21.020
 and the square is very excited

45:21.020 --> 45:23.180
 and the square is like, okay, I get it now.

45:23.180 --> 45:26.060
 So like now that you explained to me how just by reason

45:26.060 --> 45:27.380
 I can figure out what a cube would be like,

45:27.380 --> 45:29.020
 like a three dimensional version of me,

45:29.020 --> 45:31.340
 like let's figure out what a four dimensional version

45:31.340 --> 45:32.740
 of me would be like.

45:32.740 --> 45:33.980
 And then the sphere is like,

45:33.980 --> 45:34.860
 what the hell are you talking about?

45:34.860 --> 45:36.520
 There's no fourth dimension, that's ridiculous.

45:36.520 --> 45:37.740
 Like there's three dimensions,

45:37.740 --> 45:39.300
 like that's how many there are, I can see.

45:39.300 --> 45:40.880
 Like, I mean, it's this sort of comic moment

45:40.880 --> 45:44.660
 where the sphere is completely unable to conceptualize

45:44.660 --> 45:47.940
 that there could actually be yet another dimension.

45:47.940 --> 45:49.900
 So yeah, that takes the religious allegory

45:49.900 --> 45:51.340
 like a very weird place that I don't really

45:51.340 --> 45:53.140
 like understand theologically, but.

45:53.140 --> 45:57.880
 That's a nice way to talk about religion and myth in general

45:57.880 --> 46:00.960
 as perhaps us trying to struggle,

46:00.960 --> 46:03.860
 us meaning human civilization, trying to struggle

46:03.860 --> 46:08.620
 with ideas that are beyond our cognitive capabilities.

46:08.620 --> 46:10.620
 But it's in fact not beyond our capability.

46:10.620 --> 46:13.300
 It may be beyond our cognitive capabilities

46:13.300 --> 46:16.460
 to visualize a four dimensional cube,

46:16.460 --> 46:18.320
 a tesseract as some like to call it,

46:18.320 --> 46:20.800
 or a five dimensional cube, or a six dimensional cube,

46:20.800 --> 46:23.940
 but it is not beyond our cognitive capabilities

46:23.940 --> 46:26.640
 to figure out how many corners

46:26.640 --> 46:28.040
 a six dimensional cube would have.

46:28.040 --> 46:29.380
 That's what's so cool about us.

46:29.380 --> 46:31.060
 Whether we can visualize it or not,

46:31.060 --> 46:33.400
 we can still talk about it, we can still reason about it,

46:33.400 --> 46:36.160
 we can still figure things out about it.

46:36.160 --> 46:37.260
 That's amazing.

46:37.260 --> 46:41.620
 Yeah, if we go back to this, first of all, to the mug,

46:41.620 --> 46:44.980
 but to the example you give in the book of the straw,

46:44.980 --> 46:49.800
 how many holes does a straw have?

46:49.800 --> 46:54.140
 And you, listener, may try to answer that in your own head.

46:54.140 --> 46:56.220
 Yeah, I'm gonna take a drink while everybody thinks about it

46:56.220 --> 46:57.060
 so we can give you a moment.

46:57.060 --> 46:59.020
 A slow sip.

46:59.020 --> 47:04.020
 Is it zero, one, or two, or more than that maybe?

47:04.900 --> 47:06.660
 Maybe you can get very creative.

47:06.660 --> 47:10.640
 But it's kind of interesting to each,

47:10.640 --> 47:13.100
 dissecting each answer as you do in the book

47:13.100 --> 47:14.140
 is quite brilliant.

47:14.140 --> 47:15.540
 People should definitely check it out.

47:15.540 --> 47:18.420
 But if you could try to answer it now,

47:18.420 --> 47:20.300
 think about all the options

47:21.220 --> 47:23.420
 and why they may or may not be right.

47:23.420 --> 47:25.260
 Yeah, and it's one of these questions

47:25.260 --> 47:28.300
 where people on first hearing it think it's a triviality

47:28.300 --> 47:29.780
 and they're like, well, the answer is obvious.

47:29.780 --> 47:31.380
 And then what happens if you ever ask a group of people

47:31.380 --> 47:33.960
 that something wonderfully comic happens,

47:33.960 --> 47:34.800
 which is that everyone's like,

47:34.800 --> 47:36.500
 well, it's completely obvious.

47:36.500 --> 47:38.980
 And then each person realizes that half the person,

47:38.980 --> 47:39.820
 the other people in the room

47:39.820 --> 47:42.940
 have a different obvious answer for the way they have.

47:42.940 --> 47:44.420
 And then people get really heated.

47:44.420 --> 47:46.100
 People are like, I can't believe

47:46.100 --> 47:47.440
 that you think it has two holes

47:47.440 --> 47:49.660
 or like, I can't believe that you think it has one.

47:49.660 --> 47:50.580
 And then, you know, you really,

47:50.580 --> 47:52.420
 like people really learn something about each other

47:52.420 --> 47:54.440
 and people get heated.

47:54.440 --> 47:57.700
 I mean, can we go through the possible options here?

47:57.700 --> 48:01.300
 Is it zero, one, two, three, 10?

48:01.300 --> 48:04.660
 Sure, so I think, you know, most people,

48:04.660 --> 48:06.100
 the zero holders are rare.

48:06.100 --> 48:07.740
 They would say like, well, look,

48:07.740 --> 48:10.180
 you can make a straw by taking a rectangular piece of plastic

48:10.180 --> 48:11.020
 and closing it up.

48:11.020 --> 48:13.820
 A rectangular piece of plastic doesn't have a hole in it.

48:14.820 --> 48:16.980
 I didn't poke a hole in it when I,

48:16.980 --> 48:18.320
 so how can I have a hole?

48:18.320 --> 48:19.580
 They'd be like, it's just one thing.

48:19.580 --> 48:21.940
 Okay, most people don't see it that way.

48:21.940 --> 48:23.820
 That's like a...

48:23.820 --> 48:25.900
 Is there any truth to that kind of conception?

48:25.900 --> 48:28.960
 Yeah, I think that would be somebody who's account, I mean,

48:33.740 --> 48:37.340
 what I would say is you could say the same thing

48:39.420 --> 48:40.460
 about a bagel.

48:40.460 --> 48:43.100
 You could say, I can make a bagel by taking like a long

48:43.100 --> 48:45.060
 cylinder of dough, which doesn't have a hole

48:45.060 --> 48:47.720
 and then schmushing the ends together.

48:47.720 --> 48:49.060
 Now it's a bagel.

48:49.060 --> 48:50.580
 So if you're really committed, you can be like, okay,

48:50.580 --> 48:51.700
 a bagel doesn't have a hole either.

48:51.700 --> 48:54.100
 But like, who are you if you say a bagel doesn't have a hole?

48:54.100 --> 48:54.940
 I mean, I don't know.

48:54.940 --> 48:57.980
 Yeah, so that's almost like an engineering definition of it.

48:57.980 --> 48:59.000
 Okay, fair enough.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.240
 So what about the other options?

49:02.240 --> 49:06.620
 So, you know, one whole people would say...

49:07.740 --> 49:09.900
 I like how these are like groups of people.

49:09.900 --> 49:12.940
 Like we've planted our foot, this is what we stand for.

49:12.940 --> 49:16.260
 There's books written about each belief.

49:16.260 --> 49:17.580
 You know, I would say, look, there's like a hole

49:17.580 --> 49:19.140
 and it goes all the way through the straw, right?

49:19.140 --> 49:21.900
 It's one region of space, that's the hole.

49:21.900 --> 49:22.740
 And there's one.

49:22.740 --> 49:24.140
 And two whole people would say like, well, look,

49:24.140 --> 49:27.340
 there's a hole in the top and a hole at the bottom.

49:28.420 --> 49:31.540
 I think a common thing you see when people

49:34.020 --> 49:35.960
 argue about this, they would take something like this

49:35.960 --> 49:40.260
 bottle of water I'm holding and go open it and they say,

49:40.260 --> 49:41.540
 well, how many holes are there in this?

49:41.540 --> 49:44.100
 And you say like, well, there's one hole at the top.

49:44.100 --> 49:46.380
 Okay, what if I like poke a hole here

49:46.380 --> 49:48.940
 so that all the water spills out?

49:48.940 --> 49:50.860
 Well, now it's a straw.

49:50.860 --> 49:51.700
 Yeah.

49:51.700 --> 49:53.140
 So if you're a one holder, I say to you like,

49:53.140 --> 49:56.020
 well, how many holes are in it now?

49:56.020 --> 49:57.340
 There was one hole in it before

49:57.340 --> 49:59.280
 and I poked a new hole in it.

49:59.280 --> 50:01.580
 And then you think there's still one hole

50:01.580 --> 50:04.700
 even though there was one hole and I made one more?

50:04.700 --> 50:06.740
 Clearly not, this is two holes.

50:06.740 --> 50:08.180
 Yeah.

50:08.180 --> 50:10.380
 And yet if you're a two holder, the one holder will say like,

50:10.380 --> 50:13.220
 okay, where does one hole begin and the other hole end?

50:13.220 --> 50:14.060
 Yeah.

50:16.340 --> 50:18.660
 And in the book, I sort of, you know, in math,

50:18.660 --> 50:20.380
 there's two things we do when we're faced with a problem

50:20.380 --> 50:21.460
 that's confusing us.

50:22.940 --> 50:24.540
 We can make the problem simpler.

50:24.540 --> 50:25.740
 That's what we were doing a minute ago

50:25.740 --> 50:27.100
 when we were talking about high dimensional space.

50:27.100 --> 50:28.500
 And I was like, let's talk about like circles

50:28.500 --> 50:29.340
 and line segments.

50:29.340 --> 50:31.740
 Let's like go down a dimension to make it easier.

50:31.740 --> 50:35.100
 The other big move we have is to make the problem harder

50:35.100 --> 50:36.700
 and try to sort of really like face up

50:36.700 --> 50:37.660
 to what are the complications.

50:37.660 --> 50:39.580
 So, you know, what I do in the book is say like,

50:39.580 --> 50:41.220
 let's stop talking about straws for a minute

50:41.220 --> 50:42.860
 and talk about pants.

50:42.860 --> 50:46.220
 How many holes are there in a pair of pants?

50:46.220 --> 50:48.820
 So I think most people who say there's two holes in a straw

50:48.820 --> 50:51.980
 would say there's three holes in a pair of pants.

50:51.980 --> 50:54.020
 I guess, I mean, I guess we're filming only from here.

50:54.020 --> 50:56.580
 I could take up, no, I'm not gonna do it.

50:56.580 --> 50:58.300
 You'll just have to imagine the pants, sorry.

50:58.300 --> 50:59.700
 Yeah.

50:59.700 --> 51:01.220
 Lex, if you want to, no, okay, no.

51:01.220 --> 51:04.580
 That's gonna be in the director's cut.

51:04.580 --> 51:06.380
 That's that Patreon only footage.

51:06.380 --> 51:07.820
 There you go.

51:07.820 --> 51:09.500
 So many people would say there's three holes

51:09.500 --> 51:10.340
 in a pair of pants.

51:10.340 --> 51:11.980
 But you know, for instance, my daughter, when I asked,

51:11.980 --> 51:14.860
 by the way, talking to kids about this is super fun.

51:14.860 --> 51:16.380
 I highly recommend it.

51:16.380 --> 51:17.900
 What did she say?

51:17.900 --> 51:21.020
 She said, well, yeah, I feel a pair of pants

51:21.020 --> 51:23.660
 like just has two holes because yes, there's the waist,

51:23.660 --> 51:26.620
 but that's just the two leg holes stuck together.

51:26.620 --> 51:28.500
 Whoa, okay.

51:28.500 --> 51:29.860
 Two leg holes, yeah, okay.

51:29.860 --> 51:31.420
 I mean, that really is a good combination.

51:31.420 --> 51:32.340
 So she's a one holder for the straw.

51:32.340 --> 51:34.460
 So she's a one holder for the straw too.

51:34.460 --> 51:39.460
 And that really does capture something.

51:39.580 --> 51:42.860
 It captures this fact, which is central

51:42.860 --> 51:44.420
 to the theory of what's called homology,

51:44.420 --> 51:46.060
 which is like a central part of modern topology

51:46.060 --> 51:49.700
 that holes, whatever we may mean by them,

51:49.700 --> 51:51.980
 they're somehow things which have an arithmetic to them.

51:51.980 --> 51:53.940
 They're things which can be added.

51:53.940 --> 51:57.180
 Like the waist, like waist equals leg plus leg

51:57.180 --> 51:58.420
 is kind of an equation,

51:58.420 --> 52:00.100
 but it's not an equation about numbers.

52:00.100 --> 52:02.900
 It's an equation about some kind of geometric,

52:02.900 --> 52:05.420
 some kind of topological thing, which is very strange.

52:05.420 --> 52:09.220
 And so, you know, when I come down, you know,

52:09.220 --> 52:11.500
 like a rabbi, I like to kind of like come up

52:11.500 --> 52:13.340
 with these answers and somehow like dodge

52:13.340 --> 52:14.740
 the original question and say like,

52:14.740 --> 52:15.860
 you're both right, my children.

52:15.860 --> 52:17.260
 Okay, so.

52:17.260 --> 52:18.100
 Yeah.

52:19.140 --> 52:23.460
 So for the straw, I think what a modern mathematician

52:23.460 --> 52:27.980
 would say is like, the first version would be to say like,

52:27.980 --> 52:29.260
 well, there are two holes,

52:29.260 --> 52:31.340
 but they're really both the same hole.

52:31.340 --> 52:32.260
 Well, that's not quite right.

52:32.260 --> 52:34.740
 A better way to say it is there's two holes,

52:34.740 --> 52:37.500
 but one is the negative of the other.

52:37.500 --> 52:38.700
 Now, what can that mean?

52:39.860 --> 52:41.420
 One way of thinking about what it means is that

52:41.420 --> 52:44.620
 if you sip something like a milkshake through the straw,

52:44.620 --> 52:48.100
 no matter what, the amount of milkshake

52:48.100 --> 52:49.940
 that's flowing in one end,

52:49.940 --> 52:53.380
 that same amount is flowing out the other end.

52:53.380 --> 52:55.780
 So they're not independent from each other.

52:55.780 --> 52:57.660
 There's some relationship between them.

52:57.660 --> 53:00.780
 In the same way that if you somehow

53:00.780 --> 53:04.100
 could like suck a milkshake through a pair of pants,

53:05.140 --> 53:06.580
 the amount of milkshake,

53:06.580 --> 53:08.860
 just go with me on this thought experiment.

53:08.860 --> 53:09.700
 I'm right there with you.

53:09.700 --> 53:11.660
 The amount of milkshake that's coming in

53:11.660 --> 53:13.300
 the left leg of the pants,

53:13.300 --> 53:15.060
 plus the amount of milkshake that's coming in

53:15.060 --> 53:16.620
 the right leg of the pants,

53:16.620 --> 53:20.740
 is the same that's coming out the waist of the pants.

53:20.740 --> 53:23.260
 So just so you know, I fasted for 72 hours

53:24.140 --> 53:25.540
 the last three days.

53:25.540 --> 53:27.740
 So I just broke the fast with a little bit of food yesterday.

53:27.740 --> 53:32.060
 So this sounds, food analogies or metaphors

53:32.060 --> 53:33.740
 for this podcast work wonderfully

53:33.740 --> 53:35.740
 because I can intensely picture it.

53:35.740 --> 53:37.860
 Is that your weekly routine or just in preparation

53:37.860 --> 53:39.460
 for talking about geometry for three hours?

53:39.460 --> 53:41.900
 Exactly, this is just for this.

53:41.900 --> 53:44.100
 It's hardship to purify the mind.

53:44.100 --> 53:45.180
 No, it's for the first time,

53:45.180 --> 53:46.660
 I just wanted to try the experience.

53:46.660 --> 53:47.500
 Oh, wow.

53:47.500 --> 53:50.060
 And just to pause,

53:50.060 --> 53:52.060
 to do things that are out of the ordinary,

53:52.060 --> 53:55.980
 to pause and to reflect on how grateful I am

53:55.980 --> 53:59.220
 to be just alive and be able to do all the cool shit

53:59.220 --> 54:00.220
 that I get to do, so.

54:00.220 --> 54:01.340
 Did you drink water?

54:01.340 --> 54:03.060
 Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

54:03.060 --> 54:05.740
 Water and salt, so like electrolytes

54:05.740 --> 54:07.180
 and all those kinds of things.

54:07.180 --> 54:10.620
 But anyway, so the inflow on the top of the pants

54:10.620 --> 54:14.620
 equals to the outflow on the bottom of the pants.

54:14.620 --> 54:16.900
 Exactly, so this idea that,

54:18.020 --> 54:21.340
 I mean, I think, you know, Poincare really had this idea,

54:21.340 --> 54:22.820
 this sort of modern idea.

54:22.820 --> 54:25.020
 I mean, building on stuff other people did,

54:25.020 --> 54:26.700
 Betty is an important one,

54:26.700 --> 54:29.900
 of this kind of modern notion of relations between holes.

54:29.900 --> 54:32.540
 But the idea that holes really had an arithmetic,

54:32.540 --> 54:35.540
 the really modern view was really Emmy Noether's idea.

54:35.540 --> 54:39.380
 So she kind of comes in and sort of truly puts the subject

54:40.820 --> 54:43.300
 on its modern footing that we have now.

54:43.300 --> 54:45.380
 So, you know, it's always a challenge, you know,

54:45.380 --> 54:48.620
 in the book, I'm not gonna say I give like a course

54:48.620 --> 54:50.300
 so that you read this chapter and then you're like,

54:50.300 --> 54:51.940
 oh, it's just like I took like a semester

54:51.940 --> 54:53.100
 of algebraic anthropology.

54:53.100 --> 54:55.500
 It's not like this and it's always a challenge

54:55.500 --> 54:59.060
 writing about math because there are some things

55:00.260 --> 55:03.300
 that you can really do on the page and the math is there.

55:03.300 --> 55:05.860
 And there's other things which it's too much

55:05.860 --> 55:07.380
 in a book like this to like do them all the page.

55:07.380 --> 55:11.100
 You can only say something about them, if that makes sense.

55:12.620 --> 55:14.780
 So, you know, in the book, I try to do some of both.

55:14.780 --> 55:18.740
 I try to do, I try to, topics that are,

55:18.740 --> 55:22.100
 you can't really compress and really truly say

55:22.100 --> 55:25.420
 exactly what they are in this amount of space.

55:27.420 --> 55:28.980
 I try to say something interesting about them,

55:28.980 --> 55:30.180
 something meaningful about them

55:30.180 --> 55:31.740
 so that readers can get the flavor.

55:31.740 --> 55:33.420
 And then in other places,

55:34.380 --> 55:36.620
 I really try to get up close and personal

55:36.620 --> 55:40.740
 and really do the math and have it take place on the page.

55:40.740 --> 55:44.100
 To some degree be able to give inklings

55:44.100 --> 55:45.820
 of the beauty of the subject.

55:45.820 --> 55:48.260
 Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of books that are like,

55:48.260 --> 55:49.740
 I don't quite know how to express this well.

55:49.740 --> 55:51.020
 I'm still laboring to do it,

55:51.020 --> 55:56.020
 but there's a lot of books that are about stuff,

55:57.380 --> 56:01.020
 but I want my books to not only be about stuff,

56:01.020 --> 56:03.620
 but to actually have some stuff there on the page

56:03.620 --> 56:05.620
 in the book for people to interact with directly

56:05.620 --> 56:07.060
 and not just sort of hear me talk about

56:07.060 --> 56:10.500
 distant features of it.

56:10.500 --> 56:13.700
 Right, so not be talking just about ideas,

56:13.700 --> 56:16.860
 but the actually be expressing the idea.

56:16.860 --> 56:18.700
 Is there, you know, somebody in the,

56:18.700 --> 56:21.420
 maybe you can comment, there's a guy,

56:21.420 --> 56:25.460
 his YouTube channel is 3Blue1Brown, Grant Sanderson.

56:25.460 --> 56:27.860
 He does that masterfully well.

56:27.860 --> 56:28.700
 Absolutely.

56:28.700 --> 56:31.620
 Of visualizing, of expressing a particular idea

56:31.620 --> 56:34.540
 and then talking about it as well back and forth.

56:34.540 --> 56:37.020
 What do you think about Grant?

56:37.020 --> 56:37.980
 It's fantastic.

56:37.980 --> 56:40.180
 I mean, the flowering of math YouTube

56:40.180 --> 56:41.460
 is like such a wonderful thing

56:41.460 --> 56:46.460
 because math teaching, there's so many different venues

56:47.020 --> 56:48.860
 through which we can teach people math.

56:48.860 --> 56:51.500
 There's the traditional one, right?

56:51.500 --> 56:55.300
 Where I'm in a classroom with, depending on the class,

56:55.300 --> 56:57.700
 it could be 30 people, it could be a hundred people,

56:57.700 --> 56:59.460
 it could, God help me, be a 500 people

56:59.460 --> 57:01.860
 if it's like the big calculus lecture or whatever it may be.

57:01.860 --> 57:02.700
 And there's sort of some,

57:02.700 --> 57:05.060
 but there's some set of people of that order of magnitude

57:05.060 --> 57:06.460
 and I'm with them, we have a long time.

57:06.460 --> 57:08.340
 I'm with them for a whole semester

57:08.340 --> 57:10.300
 and I can ask them to do homework and we talk together.

57:10.300 --> 57:12.140
 We have office hours, if they have one on one questions,

57:12.140 --> 57:14.500
 a lot of, it's like a very high level of engagement,

57:14.500 --> 57:17.180
 but how many people am I actually hitting at a time?

57:17.180 --> 57:19.300
 Like not that many, right?

57:20.460 --> 57:22.940
 And you can, and there's kind of an inverse relationship

57:22.940 --> 57:27.740
 where the more, the fewer people you're talking to,

57:27.740 --> 57:29.300
 the more engagement you can ask for.

57:29.300 --> 57:32.020
 The ultimate of course is like the mentorship relation

57:32.020 --> 57:35.020
 of like a PhD advisor and a graduate student

57:35.020 --> 57:38.020
 where you spend a lot of one on one time together

57:38.020 --> 57:40.380
 for like three to five years.

57:41.260 --> 57:44.820
 And the ultimate high level of engagement to one person.

57:46.380 --> 57:50.420
 Books, this can get to a lot more people

57:50.420 --> 57:52.700
 that are ever gonna sit in my classroom

57:52.700 --> 57:57.060
 and you spend like however many hours it takes

57:57.060 --> 57:58.700
 to read a book.

57:58.700 --> 58:01.140
 Somebody like Three Blue One Brown or Numberphile

58:01.140 --> 58:03.140
 or people like Vi Hart.

58:03.140 --> 58:07.900
 I mean, YouTube, let's face it, has bigger reach than a book.

58:07.900 --> 58:09.660
 Like there's YouTube videos that have many, many,

58:09.660 --> 58:13.300
 many more views than like any hardback book

58:13.300 --> 58:15.820
 like not written by a Kardashian or an Obama

58:15.820 --> 58:16.660
 is gonna sell, right?

58:16.660 --> 58:17.580
 So that's, I mean,

58:20.100 --> 58:24.860
 and then those are, some of them are like longer,

58:24.860 --> 58:26.580
 20 minutes long, some of them are five minutes long,

58:26.580 --> 58:27.820
 but they're shorter.

58:27.820 --> 58:29.740
 And then even some of you look like Eugenia Chang

58:29.740 --> 58:31.540
 who's a wonderful category theorist in Chicago.

58:31.540 --> 58:33.620
 I mean, she was on, I think the Daily Show or is it,

58:33.620 --> 58:35.820
 I mean, she was on, she has 30 seconds,

58:35.820 --> 58:37.060
 but then there's like 30 seconds

58:37.060 --> 58:38.740
 to sort of say something about mathematics

58:38.740 --> 58:41.100
 to like untold millions of people.

58:41.100 --> 58:43.980
 So everywhere along this curve is important.

58:43.980 --> 58:46.580
 And one thing I feel like is great right now

58:46.580 --> 58:49.220
 is that people are just broadcasting on all the channels

58:49.220 --> 58:51.900
 because we each have our skills, right?

58:51.900 --> 58:53.820
 Somehow along the way, like I learned how to write books.

58:53.820 --> 58:55.700
 I had this kind of weird life as a writer

58:55.700 --> 58:57.100
 where I sort of spent a lot of time

58:57.100 --> 58:59.620
 like thinking about how to put English words together

58:59.620 --> 59:01.880
 into sentences and sentences together into paragraphs,

59:01.880 --> 59:03.300
 like at length,

59:03.300 --> 59:06.940
 which is this kind of like weird specialized skill.

59:06.940 --> 59:09.140
 And that's one thing, but like sort of being able to make

59:09.140 --> 59:13.000
 like winning, good looking, eye catching videos

59:13.000 --> 59:15.060
 is like a totally different skill.

59:15.060 --> 59:16.740
 And probably somewhere out there,

59:16.740 --> 59:19.540
 there's probably sort of some like heavy metal band

59:19.540 --> 59:21.820
 that's like teaching math through heavy metal

59:21.820 --> 59:23.340
 and like using their skills to do that.

59:23.340 --> 59:25.060
 I hope there is at any rate.

59:25.060 --> 59:26.580
 Their music and so on, yeah.

59:26.580 --> 59:28.820
 But there is something to the process.

59:28.820 --> 59:31.740
 I mean, Grant does this especially well,

59:31.740 --> 59:36.420
 which is in order to be able to visualize something,

59:36.420 --> 59:39.560
 now he writes programs, so it's programmatic visualization.

59:39.560 --> 59:42.900
 So like the things he is basically mostly

59:42.900 --> 59:46.220
 through his Manum library and Python,

59:46.220 --> 59:48.280
 everything is drawn through Python.

59:49.340 --> 59:54.340
 You have to truly understand the topic

59:54.600 --> 59:58.140
 to be able to visualize it in that way

59:58.140 --> 59:59.700
 and not just understand it,

59:59.700 --> 1:00:04.380
 but really kind of think in a very novel way.

1:00:04.380 --> 1:00:07.540
 It's funny because I've spoken with him a couple of times,

1:00:07.540 --> 1:00:09.860
 spoken to him a lot offline as well.

1:00:09.860 --> 1:00:14.100
 He really doesn't think he's doing anything new,

1:00:14.100 --> 1:00:17.380
 meaning like he sees himself as very different

1:00:17.380 --> 1:00:19.240
 from maybe like a researcher,

1:00:20.460 --> 1:00:25.460
 but it feels to me like he's creating something totally new.

1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:29.340
 Like that act of understanding and visualizing

1:00:29.340 --> 1:00:33.380
 is as powerful or has the same kind of inkling of power

1:00:33.380 --> 1:00:35.920
 as does the process of proving something.

1:00:36.980 --> 1:00:39.940
 It doesn't have that clear destination,

1:00:39.940 --> 1:00:42.180
 but it's pulling out an insight

1:00:42.180 --> 1:00:44.900
 and creating multiple sets of perspective

1:00:44.900 --> 1:00:46.980
 that arrive at that insight.

1:00:46.980 --> 1:00:49.220
 And to be honest, it's something that I think

1:00:49.220 --> 1:00:53.340
 we haven't quite figured out how to value

1:00:53.340 --> 1:00:55.380
 inside academic mathematics in the same way,

1:00:55.380 --> 1:00:56.220
 and this is a bit older,

1:00:56.220 --> 1:00:57.780
 that I think we haven't quite figured out

1:00:57.780 --> 1:00:59.460
 how to value the development

1:00:59.460 --> 1:01:01.020
 of computational infrastructure.

1:01:01.020 --> 1:01:02.900
 We all have computers as our partners now

1:01:02.900 --> 1:01:07.860
 and people build computers that sort of assist

1:01:07.860 --> 1:01:09.300
 and participate in our mathematics.

1:01:09.300 --> 1:01:10.480
 They build those systems

1:01:10.480 --> 1:01:12.600
 and that's a kind of mathematics too,

1:01:12.600 --> 1:01:14.020
 but not in the traditional form

1:01:14.020 --> 1:01:16.420
 of proving theorems and writing papers.

1:01:16.420 --> 1:01:17.260
 But I think it's coming.

1:01:17.260 --> 1:01:20.380
 Look, I mean, I think, for example,

1:01:20.380 --> 1:01:23.520
 the Institute for Computational Experimental Mathematics

1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:27.820
 at Brown, which is like, it's a NSF funded math institute,

1:01:27.820 --> 1:01:29.860
 very much part of sort of traditional math academia.

1:01:29.860 --> 1:01:31.720
 They did an entire theme semester

1:01:31.720 --> 1:01:33.180
 about visualizing mathematics,

1:01:33.180 --> 1:01:34.620
 looking at the same kind of thing that they would do

1:01:34.620 --> 1:01:37.780
 for like an up and coming research topic.

1:01:37.780 --> 1:01:38.620
 Like that's pretty cool.

1:01:38.620 --> 1:01:40.260
 So I think there really is buy in

1:01:40.260 --> 1:01:43.380
 from the mathematics community

1:01:43.380 --> 1:01:45.420
 to recognize that this kind of stuff is important

1:01:45.420 --> 1:01:47.540
 and counts as part of mathematics,

1:01:47.540 --> 1:01:50.560
 like part of what we're actually here to do.

1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:52.020
 Yeah, I'm hoping to see more and more of that

1:01:52.020 --> 1:01:54.420
 from like MIT faculty, from faculty,

1:01:54.420 --> 1:01:57.540
 from all the top universities in the world.

1:01:57.540 --> 1:02:00.020
 Let me ask you this weird question about the Fields Medal,

1:02:00.020 --> 1:02:02.960
 which is the Nobel Prize in Mathematics.

1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:05.540
 Do you think, since we're talking about computers,

1:02:05.540 --> 1:02:10.540
 there will one day come a time when a computer,

1:02:11.860 --> 1:02:14.100
 an AI system will win a Fields Medal?

1:02:16.060 --> 1:02:16.900
 No.

1:02:16.900 --> 1:02:19.740
 Of course, that's what a human would say.

1:02:19.740 --> 1:02:20.580
 Why not?

1:02:20.580 --> 1:02:23.380
 Is that like, that's like my captcha?

1:02:23.380 --> 1:02:24.500
 That's like the proof that I'm a human?

1:02:24.500 --> 1:02:25.340
 Is that like the lie that I know?

1:02:25.340 --> 1:02:26.820
 Yeah.

1:02:26.820 --> 1:02:28.940
 What is, how does he want me to answer?

1:02:28.940 --> 1:02:31.980
 Is there something interesting to be said about that?

1:02:31.980 --> 1:02:34.620
 Yeah, I mean, I am tremendously interested

1:02:34.620 --> 1:02:37.820
 in what AI can do in pure mathematics.

1:02:37.820 --> 1:02:40.500
 I mean, it's, of course, it's a parochial interest, right?

1:02:40.500 --> 1:02:41.700
 You're like, why am I interested in like,

1:02:41.700 --> 1:02:43.140
 how it can like help feed the world

1:02:43.140 --> 1:02:44.700
 or help solve like real social problems?

1:02:44.700 --> 1:02:46.140
 I'm like, can it do more math?

1:02:46.140 --> 1:02:47.540
 Like, what can I do?

1:02:47.540 --> 1:02:49.580
 We all have our interests, right?

1:02:49.580 --> 1:02:53.700
 But I think it is a really interesting conceptual question.

1:02:53.700 --> 1:02:58.700
 And here too, I think it's important to be kind of historical

1:02:59.820 --> 1:03:02.260
 because it's certainly true that there's lots of things

1:03:02.260 --> 1:03:04.940
 that we used to call research in mathematics

1:03:04.940 --> 1:03:07.380
 that we would now call computation.

1:03:07.380 --> 1:03:09.620
 Tasks that we've now offloaded to machines.

1:03:09.620 --> 1:03:12.580
 Like, you know, in 1890, somebody could be like,

1:03:12.580 --> 1:03:13.780
 here's my PhD thesis.

1:03:13.780 --> 1:03:18.180
 I computed all the invariants of this polynomial ring

1:03:18.180 --> 1:03:19.900
 under the action of some finite group.

1:03:19.900 --> 1:03:21.380
 Doesn't matter what those words mean,

1:03:21.380 --> 1:03:24.020
 just it's like some thing that in 1890

1:03:24.020 --> 1:03:26.060
 would take a person a year to do

1:03:26.060 --> 1:03:28.060
 and would be a valuable thing that you might wanna know.

1:03:28.060 --> 1:03:29.940
 And it's still a valuable thing that you might wanna know,

1:03:29.940 --> 1:03:32.780
 but now you type a few lines of code

1:03:32.780 --> 1:03:37.740
 in Macaulay or Sage or Magma and you just have it.

1:03:37.740 --> 1:03:40.260
 So we don't think of that as math anymore,

1:03:40.260 --> 1:03:41.700
 even though it's the same thing.

1:03:41.700 --> 1:03:43.420
 What's Macaulay, Sage and Magma?

1:03:43.420 --> 1:03:45.060
 Oh, those are computer algebra programs.

1:03:45.060 --> 1:03:46.900
 So those are like sort of bespoke systems

1:03:46.900 --> 1:03:48.140
 that lots of mathematicians use.

1:03:48.140 --> 1:03:49.620
 That's similar to Maple and...

1:03:49.620 --> 1:03:51.580
 Yeah, oh yeah, so it's similar to Maple and Mathematica,

1:03:51.580 --> 1:03:54.700
 yeah, but a little more specialized, but yeah.

1:03:54.700 --> 1:03:56.620
 It's programs that work with symbols

1:03:56.620 --> 1:03:58.180
 and allow you to do, can you do proofs?

1:03:58.180 --> 1:04:01.060
 Can you do kind of little leaps and proofs?

1:04:01.060 --> 1:04:02.420
 They're not really built for that.

1:04:02.420 --> 1:04:04.780
 And that's a whole other story.

1:04:04.780 --> 1:04:07.300
 But these tools are part of the process of mathematics now.

1:04:07.300 --> 1:04:09.940
 Right, they are now for most mathematicians, I would say,

1:04:09.940 --> 1:04:11.620
 part of the process of mathematics.

1:04:11.620 --> 1:04:14.740
 And so, you know, there's a story I tell in the book,

1:04:14.740 --> 1:04:17.740
 which I'm fascinated by, which is, you know,

1:04:17.740 --> 1:04:22.540
 so far, attempts to get AIs

1:04:22.540 --> 1:04:27.300
 to prove interesting theorems have not done so well.

1:04:27.300 --> 1:04:28.140
 It doesn't mean they can.

1:04:28.140 --> 1:04:29.740
 There's actually a paper I just saw,

1:04:29.740 --> 1:04:32.460
 which has a very nice use of a neural net

1:04:32.460 --> 1:04:34.620
 to find counter examples to conjecture.

1:04:34.620 --> 1:04:37.220
 Somebody said like, well, maybe this is always that.

1:04:37.220 --> 1:04:39.300
 And you can be like, well, let me sort of train an AI

1:04:39.300 --> 1:04:43.180
 to sort of try to find things where that's not true.

1:04:43.180 --> 1:04:44.020
 And it actually succeeded.

1:04:44.020 --> 1:04:48.180
 Now, in this case, if you look at the things that it found,

1:04:48.180 --> 1:04:53.180
 you say like, okay, I mean, these are not famous conjectures.

1:04:53.180 --> 1:04:58.180
 Okay, so like somebody wrote this down, maybe this is so.

1:04:58.220 --> 1:05:00.900
 Looking at what the AI came up with, you're like,

1:05:00.900 --> 1:05:03.700
 you know, I bet if like five grad students

1:05:03.700 --> 1:05:04.660
 had thought about that problem,

1:05:04.660 --> 1:05:05.500
 they wouldn't have come up with that.

1:05:05.500 --> 1:05:06.820
 I mean, when you see it, you're like,

1:05:06.820 --> 1:05:08.380
 okay, that is one of the things you might try

1:05:08.380 --> 1:05:10.500
 if you sort of like put some work into it.

1:05:10.500 --> 1:05:12.620
 Still, it's pretty awesome.

1:05:12.620 --> 1:05:15.740
 But the story I tell in the book, which I'm fascinated by

1:05:15.740 --> 1:05:20.740
 is there is, okay, we're gonna go back to knots.

1:05:21.940 --> 1:05:23.940
 There's a knot called the Conway knot.

1:05:23.940 --> 1:05:25.380
 After John Conway, maybe we'll talk about

1:05:25.380 --> 1:05:26.420
 a very interesting character also.

1:05:26.420 --> 1:05:28.140
 Yeah, it's a small tangent.

1:05:28.140 --> 1:05:29.420
 Somebody I was supposed to talk to

1:05:29.420 --> 1:05:30.780
 and unfortunately he passed away

1:05:30.780 --> 1:05:35.220
 and he's somebody I find as an incredible mathematician,

1:05:35.220 --> 1:05:36.220
 incredible human being.

1:05:36.220 --> 1:05:38.300
 Oh, and I am sorry that you didn't get a chance

1:05:38.300 --> 1:05:40.300
 because having had the chance to talk to him a lot

1:05:40.300 --> 1:05:44.140
 when I was a postdoc, yeah, you missed out.

1:05:44.140 --> 1:05:45.140
 There's no way to sugarcoat it.

1:05:45.140 --> 1:05:46.620
 I'm sorry that you didn't get that chance.

1:05:46.620 --> 1:05:47.900
 Yeah, it is what it is.

1:05:47.900 --> 1:05:50.100
 So knots.

1:05:50.100 --> 1:05:52.580
 Yeah, so there was a question and again,

1:05:52.580 --> 1:05:54.380
 it doesn't matter the technicalities of the question,

1:05:54.380 --> 1:05:56.300
 but it's a question of whether the knot is slice.

1:05:56.300 --> 1:05:59.980
 It has to do with something about what kinds

1:05:59.980 --> 1:06:02.340
 of three dimensional surfaces and four dimensions

1:06:02.340 --> 1:06:03.460
 can be bounded by this knot.

1:06:03.460 --> 1:06:06.180
 But nevermind what it means, it's some question.

1:06:06.180 --> 1:06:08.300
 And it's actually very hard to compute

1:06:08.300 --> 1:06:10.540
 whether a knot is slice or not.

1:06:12.860 --> 1:06:16.940
 And in particular, the question of the Conway knot,

1:06:16.940 --> 1:06:21.260
 whether it was slice or not, was particularly vexed

1:06:23.060 --> 1:06:24.620
 until it was solved just a few years ago

1:06:24.620 --> 1:06:26.260
 by Lisa Piccarillo, who actually,

1:06:26.260 --> 1:06:27.700
 now that I think of it, was here in Austin.

1:06:27.700 --> 1:06:29.980
 I believe she was a grad student at UT Austin at the time.

1:06:29.980 --> 1:06:31.540
 I didn't even realize there was an Austin connection

1:06:31.540 --> 1:06:34.100
 to this story until I started telling it.

1:06:34.100 --> 1:06:35.780
 In fact, I think she's now at MIT,

1:06:35.780 --> 1:06:38.140
 so she's basically following you around.

1:06:38.140 --> 1:06:38.980
 If I remember correctly.

1:06:38.980 --> 1:06:39.820
 The reverse.

1:06:39.820 --> 1:06:42.700
 There's a lot of really interesting richness to this story.

1:06:42.700 --> 1:06:45.620
 One thing about it is her paper was rather,

1:06:45.620 --> 1:06:48.140
 was very short, it was very short and simple.

1:06:48.140 --> 1:06:49.980
 Nine pages of which two were pictures.

1:06:51.660 --> 1:06:54.620
 Very short for like a paper solving a major conjecture.

1:06:54.620 --> 1:06:55.900
 And it really makes you think about what we mean

1:06:55.900 --> 1:06:57.300
 by difficulty in mathematics.

1:06:57.300 --> 1:06:59.460
 Like, do you say, oh, actually the problem wasn't difficult

1:06:59.460 --> 1:07:00.860
 because you could solve it so simply?

1:07:00.860 --> 1:07:03.300
 Or do you say like, well, no, evidently it was difficult

1:07:03.300 --> 1:07:05.180
 because like the world's top topologists,

1:07:05.180 --> 1:07:06.580
 many, you know, worked on it for 20 years

1:07:06.580 --> 1:07:08.540
 and nobody could solve it, so therefore it is difficult.

1:07:08.540 --> 1:07:10.460
 Or is it that we need sort of some new category

1:07:10.460 --> 1:07:12.820
 of things that about which it's difficult

1:07:12.820 --> 1:07:14.820
 to figure out that they're not difficult?

1:07:15.700 --> 1:07:18.660
 I mean, this is the computer science formulation,

1:07:18.660 --> 1:07:22.740
 but the sort of the journey to arrive

1:07:22.740 --> 1:07:24.700
 at the simple answer may be difficult,

1:07:24.700 --> 1:07:28.700
 but once you have the answer, it will then appear simple.

1:07:28.700 --> 1:07:30.620
 And I mean, there might be a large category.

1:07:30.620 --> 1:07:37.380
 I hope there's a large set of such solutions,

1:07:37.380 --> 1:07:41.460
 because, you know, once we stand

1:07:41.460 --> 1:07:43.380
 at the end of the scientific process

1:07:43.380 --> 1:07:46.100
 that we're at the very beginning of,

1:07:46.100 --> 1:07:47.540
 or at least it feels like,

1:07:47.540 --> 1:07:50.140
 I hope there's just simple answers to everything

1:07:50.140 --> 1:07:53.580
 that we'll look and it'll be simple laws

1:07:53.580 --> 1:07:55.100
 that govern the universe,

1:07:55.100 --> 1:07:58.020
 simple explanation of what is consciousness,

1:07:58.020 --> 1:08:02.340
 what is love, is mortality fundamental to life,

1:08:02.340 --> 1:08:07.100
 what's the meaning of life, are humans special

1:08:07.100 --> 1:08:09.100
 or we're just another sort of reflection

1:08:09.100 --> 1:08:13.740
 of all that is beautiful in the universe

1:08:13.740 --> 1:08:16.180
 in terms of like life forms, all of it is life

1:08:16.180 --> 1:08:18.380
 and just has different,

1:08:18.380 --> 1:08:19.900
 when taken from a different perspective

1:08:19.900 --> 1:08:22.460
 is all life can seem more valuable or not,

1:08:22.460 --> 1:08:24.180
 but really it's all part of the same thing.

1:08:24.180 --> 1:08:26.500
 All those will have a nice, like two equations,

1:08:26.500 --> 1:08:28.100
 maybe one equation, but.

1:08:28.100 --> 1:08:30.820
 Why do you think you want those questions

1:08:30.820 --> 1:08:32.740
 to have simple answers?

1:08:32.740 --> 1:08:35.700
 I think just like symmetry

1:08:35.700 --> 1:08:39.020
 and the breaking of symmetry is beautiful somehow.

1:08:39.020 --> 1:08:41.420
 There's something beautiful about simplicity.

1:08:41.420 --> 1:08:42.260
 I think it, what is that?

1:08:42.260 --> 1:08:43.420
 So it's aesthetic.

1:08:43.420 --> 1:08:45.140
 It's aesthetic, yeah.

1:08:45.140 --> 1:08:47.100
 Or, but it's aesthetic in the way

1:08:47.100 --> 1:08:49.660
 that happiness is an aesthetic.

1:08:49.660 --> 1:08:53.660
 Like, why is that so joyful

1:08:53.660 --> 1:08:57.700
 that a simple explanation that governs

1:08:57.700 --> 1:09:00.740
 a large number of cases is really appealing?

1:09:01.940 --> 1:09:05.820
 Even when it's not, like obviously we get

1:09:05.820 --> 1:09:07.340
 a huge amount of trouble with that

1:09:07.340 --> 1:09:11.460
 because oftentimes it doesn't have to be connected

1:09:11.460 --> 1:09:13.500
 with reality or even that explanation

1:09:13.500 --> 1:09:15.580
 could be exceptionally harmful.

1:09:15.580 --> 1:09:18.860
 Most of like the world's history that has,

1:09:18.860 --> 1:09:21.020
 that was governed by hate and violence

1:09:21.020 --> 1:09:23.980
 had a very simple explanation at the core

1:09:23.980 --> 1:09:26.980
 that was used to cause the violence and the hatred.

1:09:26.980 --> 1:09:28.780
 So like we get into trouble with that,

1:09:28.780 --> 1:09:30.420
 but why is that so appealing?

1:09:30.420 --> 1:09:33.820
 And in this nice forms in mathematics,

1:09:33.820 --> 1:09:36.580
 like you look at the Einstein papers,

1:09:36.580 --> 1:09:38.020
 why are those so beautiful?

1:09:38.020 --> 1:09:40.180
 And why is the Andrew Wiles proof

1:09:40.180 --> 1:09:43.220
 of the Fermat's last theorem not quite so beautiful?

1:09:43.220 --> 1:09:45.620
 Like what's beautiful about that story

1:09:45.620 --> 1:09:48.900
 is the human struggle of like the human story

1:09:48.900 --> 1:09:51.700
 of perseverance, of the drama,

1:09:51.700 --> 1:09:53.900
 of not knowing if the proof is correct

1:09:53.900 --> 1:09:56.060
 and ups and downs and all of those kinds of things.

1:09:56.060 --> 1:09:57.220
 That's the interesting part.

1:09:57.220 --> 1:09:58.660
 But the fact that the proof is huge

1:09:58.660 --> 1:10:00.020
 and nobody understands, well,

1:10:00.020 --> 1:10:01.220
 from my outsider's perspective,

1:10:01.220 --> 1:10:03.220
 nobody understands what the heck it is,

1:10:04.620 --> 1:10:06.700
 is not as beautiful as it could have been.

1:10:06.700 --> 1:10:09.220
 I wish it was what Fermat originally said,

1:10:09.220 --> 1:10:13.740
 which is, you know, it's not,

1:10:13.740 --> 1:10:17.220
 it's not small enough to fit in the margins of this page,

1:10:17.220 --> 1:10:19.300
 but maybe if he had like a full page

1:10:19.300 --> 1:10:20.820
 or maybe a couple of post it notes,

1:10:20.820 --> 1:10:22.940
 he would have enough to do the proof.

1:10:22.940 --> 1:10:23.860
 What do you make of,

1:10:23.860 --> 1:10:27.740
 if we could take another of a multitude of tangents,

1:10:27.740 --> 1:10:29.260
 what do you make of Fermat's last theorem?

1:10:29.260 --> 1:10:31.660
 Because the statement, there's a few theorems,

1:10:31.660 --> 1:10:35.540
 there's a few problems that are deemed by the world

1:10:35.540 --> 1:10:37.780
 throughout its history to be exceptionally difficult.

1:10:37.780 --> 1:10:42.380
 And that one in particular is really simple to formulate

1:10:42.380 --> 1:10:46.260
 and really hard to come up with a proof for.

1:10:46.260 --> 1:10:51.260
 And it was like taunted as simple by Fermat himself.

1:10:51.340 --> 1:10:53.900
 Is there something interesting to be said about

1:10:53.900 --> 1:10:57.700
 that X to the N plus Y to the N equals Z to the N

1:10:57.700 --> 1:11:02.540
 for N of three or greater, is there a solution to this?

1:11:02.540 --> 1:11:04.300
 And then how do you go about proving that?

1:11:04.300 --> 1:11:08.180
 Like, how would you try to prove that?

1:11:08.180 --> 1:11:09.980
 And what do you learn from the proof

1:11:09.980 --> 1:11:12.100
 that eventually emerged by Andrew Wiles?

1:11:12.100 --> 1:11:13.460
 Yeah, so right, so to give,

1:11:13.460 --> 1:11:14.380
 let me just say the background,

1:11:14.380 --> 1:11:17.020
 because I don't know if everybody listening knows the story.

1:11:17.020 --> 1:11:21.940
 So, you know, Fermat was an early number theorist,

1:11:21.940 --> 1:11:23.100
 at least sort of an early mathematician,

1:11:23.100 --> 1:11:26.060
 those special adjacent didn't really exist back then.

1:11:27.340 --> 1:11:28.660
 He comes up in the book actually,

1:11:28.660 --> 1:11:31.460
 in the context of a different theorem of his

1:11:31.460 --> 1:11:32.620
 that has to do with testing,

1:11:32.620 --> 1:11:34.620
 whether a number is prime or not.

1:11:34.620 --> 1:11:37.380
 So I write about, he was one of the ones who was salty

1:11:37.380 --> 1:11:39.460
 and like, he would exchange these letters

1:11:39.460 --> 1:11:41.100
 where he and his correspondents would like

1:11:41.100 --> 1:11:44.060
 try to top each other and vex each other with questions

1:11:44.060 --> 1:11:44.900
 and stuff like this.

1:11:44.900 --> 1:11:45.980
 But this particular thing,

1:11:47.900 --> 1:11:50.780
 it's called Fermat's Last Theorem because it's a note

1:11:50.780 --> 1:11:55.780
 he wrote in his copy of the Disquisitiones Arithmetic I.

1:11:57.340 --> 1:12:00.820
 Like he wrote, here's an equation, it has no solutions.

1:12:00.820 --> 1:12:03.300
 I can prove it, but the proof's like a little too long

1:12:03.300 --> 1:12:05.500
 to fit in the margin of this book.

1:12:05.500 --> 1:12:07.060
 He was just like writing a note to himself.

1:12:07.060 --> 1:12:08.540
 Now, let me just say historically,

1:12:08.540 --> 1:12:11.540
 we know that Fermat did not have a proof of this theorem.

1:12:11.540 --> 1:12:15.420
 For a long time, people were like this mysterious proof

1:12:15.420 --> 1:12:17.220
 that was lost, a very romantic story, right?

1:12:17.220 --> 1:12:21.300
 But a fair amount later,

1:12:21.300 --> 1:12:24.260
 he did prove special cases of this theorem

1:12:24.260 --> 1:12:27.300
 and wrote about it, talked to people about the problem.

1:12:27.300 --> 1:12:29.060
 It's very clear from the way that he wrote

1:12:29.060 --> 1:12:30.700
 where he can solve certain examples

1:12:30.700 --> 1:12:32.100
 of this type of equation

1:12:32.100 --> 1:12:35.700
 that he did not know how to do the whole thing.

1:12:35.700 --> 1:12:39.860
 He may have had a deep, simple intuition

1:12:39.860 --> 1:12:41.740
 about how to solve the whole thing

1:12:41.740 --> 1:12:43.780
 that he had at that moment

1:12:43.780 --> 1:12:47.020
 without ever being able to come up with a complete proof.

1:12:47.020 --> 1:12:49.060
 And that intuition maybe lost the time.

1:12:50.420 --> 1:12:54.500
 Maybe, but you're right, that is unknowable.

1:12:54.500 --> 1:12:56.940
 But I think what we can know is that later,

1:12:56.940 --> 1:12:59.100
 he certainly did not think that he had a proof

1:12:59.100 --> 1:13:00.620
 that he was concealing from people.

1:13:00.620 --> 1:13:04.340
 He thought he didn't know how to prove it,

1:13:04.340 --> 1:13:06.380
 and I also think he didn't know how to prove it.

1:13:06.380 --> 1:13:10.180
 Now, I understand the appeal of saying like,

1:13:10.180 --> 1:13:12.500
 wouldn't it be cool if this very simple equation

1:13:12.500 --> 1:13:16.020
 there was like a very simple, clever, wonderful proof

1:13:16.020 --> 1:13:17.340
 that you could do in a page or two.

1:13:17.340 --> 1:13:18.980
 And that would be great, but you know what?

1:13:18.980 --> 1:13:20.340
 There's lots of equations like that

1:13:20.340 --> 1:13:22.180
 that are solved by very clever methods like that,

1:13:22.180 --> 1:13:24.340
 including the special cases that Fermat wrote about,

1:13:24.340 --> 1:13:25.180
 the method of descent,

1:13:25.180 --> 1:13:26.860
 which is like very wonderful and important.

1:13:26.860 --> 1:13:31.700
 But in the end, those are nice things

1:13:31.700 --> 1:13:34.780
 that like you teach in an undergraduate class,

1:13:34.780 --> 1:13:35.860
 and it is what it is,

1:13:35.860 --> 1:13:37.020
 but they're not big.

1:13:38.660 --> 1:13:41.580
 On the other hand, work on the Fermat problem,

1:13:41.580 --> 1:13:42.420
 that's what we like to call it

1:13:42.420 --> 1:13:44.100
 because it's not really his theorem

1:13:44.100 --> 1:13:45.220
 because we don't think he proved it.

1:13:45.220 --> 1:13:49.180
 So, I mean, work on the Fermat problem

1:13:49.180 --> 1:13:52.340
 developed this like incredible richness of number theory

1:13:52.340 --> 1:13:54.780
 that we now live in today.

1:13:54.780 --> 1:13:56.060
 Like, and not, by the way,

1:13:56.060 --> 1:13:58.660
 just Wiles, Andrew Wiles being the person

1:13:58.660 --> 1:13:59.660
 who, together with Richard Taylor,

1:13:59.660 --> 1:14:01.700
 finally proved this theorem.

1:14:01.700 --> 1:14:03.220
 But you know how you have this whole moment

1:14:03.220 --> 1:14:05.380
 that people try to prove this theorem

1:14:05.380 --> 1:14:06.540
 and they fail,

1:14:06.540 --> 1:14:08.780
 and there's a famous false proof by LeMay

1:14:08.780 --> 1:14:10.420
 from the 19th century,

1:14:10.420 --> 1:14:14.460
 where Kummer, in understanding what mistake LeMay had made

1:14:14.460 --> 1:14:16.300
 in this incorrect proof,

1:14:16.300 --> 1:14:18.340
 basically understands something incredible,

1:14:18.340 --> 1:14:20.940
 which is that a thing we know about numbers

1:14:20.940 --> 1:14:24.500
 is that you can factor them

1:14:24.500 --> 1:14:26.940
 and you can factor them uniquely.

1:14:26.940 --> 1:14:30.300
 There's only one way to break a number up into primes.

1:14:30.300 --> 1:14:32.260
 Like if we think of a number like 12,

1:14:32.260 --> 1:14:35.500
 12 is two times three times two.

1:14:35.500 --> 1:14:36.700
 I had to think about it.

1:14:38.420 --> 1:14:39.700
 Or it's two times two times three,

1:14:39.700 --> 1:14:41.580
 of course you can reorder them.

1:14:41.580 --> 1:14:43.220
 But there's no other way to do it.

1:14:43.220 --> 1:14:46.140
 There's no universe in which 12 is something times five,

1:14:46.140 --> 1:14:47.500
 or in which there's like four threes in it.

1:14:47.500 --> 1:14:49.140
 Nope, 12 is like two twos and a three.

1:14:49.140 --> 1:14:50.700
 Like that is what it is.

1:14:50.700 --> 1:14:54.820
 And that's such a fundamental feature of arithmetic

1:14:54.820 --> 1:14:56.540
 that we almost think of it like God's law.

1:14:56.540 --> 1:14:57.380
 You know what I mean?

1:14:57.380 --> 1:14:58.220
 It has to be that way.

1:14:58.220 --> 1:15:00.020
 That's a really powerful idea.

1:15:00.020 --> 1:15:02.540
 It's so cool that every number

1:15:02.540 --> 1:15:04.740
 is uniquely made up of other numbers.

1:15:05.620 --> 1:15:10.620
 And like made up meaning like there's these like basic atoms

1:15:10.900 --> 1:15:15.380
 that form molecules that get built on top of each other.

1:15:15.380 --> 1:15:16.220
 I love it.

1:15:16.220 --> 1:15:18.060
 I mean, when I teach undergraduate number theory,

1:15:18.060 --> 1:15:22.180
 it's like, it's the first really deep theorem

1:15:22.180 --> 1:15:23.540
 that you prove.

1:15:23.540 --> 1:15:25.300
 What's amazing is the fact

1:15:25.300 --> 1:15:28.980
 that you can factor a number into primes is much easier.

1:15:28.980 --> 1:15:30.340
 Essentially Euclid knew it,

1:15:30.340 --> 1:15:33.700
 although he didn't quite put it in that way.

1:15:33.700 --> 1:15:34.860
 The fact that you can do it at all.

1:15:34.860 --> 1:15:38.820
 What's deep is the fact that there's only one way to do it

1:15:38.820 --> 1:15:40.620
 or however you sort of chop the number up,

1:15:40.620 --> 1:15:43.440
 you end up with the same set of prime factors.

1:15:44.820 --> 1:15:48.260
 And indeed what people finally understood

1:15:49.300 --> 1:15:51.900
 at the end of the 19th century is that

1:15:51.900 --> 1:15:54.620
 if you work in number systems slightly more general

1:15:54.620 --> 1:15:56.100
 than the ones we're used to,

1:15:56.100 --> 1:16:00.260
 which it turns out are relevant to Fermat,

1:16:01.220 --> 1:16:03.120
 all of a sudden this stops being true.

1:16:04.320 --> 1:16:07.980
 Things get, I mean, things get more complicated

1:16:07.980 --> 1:16:10.060
 and now because you were praising simplicity before

1:16:10.060 --> 1:16:12.700
 you were like, it's so beautiful, unique factorization.

1:16:12.700 --> 1:16:13.740
 It's so great.

1:16:13.740 --> 1:16:14.900
 Like, so when I tell you

1:16:14.900 --> 1:16:16.700
 that in more general number systems,

1:16:16.700 --> 1:16:18.380
 there is no unique factorization.

1:16:18.380 --> 1:16:19.360
 Maybe you're like, that's bad.

1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:20.260
 I'm like, no, that's good

1:16:20.260 --> 1:16:22.580
 because there's like a whole new world of phenomena

1:16:22.580 --> 1:16:24.380
 to study that you just can't see

1:16:24.380 --> 1:16:26.980
 through the lens of the numbers that we're used to.

1:16:26.980 --> 1:16:29.940
 So I'm for complication.

1:16:29.940 --> 1:16:32.380
 I'm highly in favor of complication

1:16:32.380 --> 1:16:34.620
 because every complication is like an opportunity

1:16:34.620 --> 1:16:35.900
 for new things to study.

1:16:35.900 --> 1:16:40.180
 And is that the big kind of one of the big insights

1:16:40.180 --> 1:16:42.900
 for you from Andrew Wiles's proof?

1:16:42.900 --> 1:16:46.300
 Is there interesting insights about the process

1:16:46.300 --> 1:16:49.580
 that you used to prove that sort of resonates

1:16:49.580 --> 1:16:51.380
 with you as a mathematician?

1:16:51.380 --> 1:16:54.420
 Is there an interesting concept that emerged from it?

1:16:54.420 --> 1:16:57.980
 Is there interesting human aspects to the proof?

1:16:57.980 --> 1:16:59.860
 Whether there's interesting human aspects

1:16:59.860 --> 1:17:02.640
 to the proof itself is an interesting question.

1:17:02.640 --> 1:17:05.520
 Certainly it has a huge amount of richness.

1:17:05.520 --> 1:17:07.680
 Sort of at its heart is an argument

1:17:07.680 --> 1:17:10.020
 of what's called deformation theory,

1:17:12.420 --> 1:17:17.420
 which was in part created by my PhD advisor, Barry Mazer.

1:17:18.200 --> 1:17:20.180
 Can you speak to what deformation theory is?

1:17:20.180 --> 1:17:21.940
 I can speak to what it's like.

1:17:21.940 --> 1:17:22.940
 How about that?

1:17:22.940 --> 1:17:24.660
 What does it rhyme with?

1:17:24.660 --> 1:17:27.340
 Right, well, the reason that Barry called it

1:17:27.340 --> 1:17:29.460
 deformation theory, I think he's the one

1:17:29.460 --> 1:17:30.860
 who gave it the name.

1:17:30.860 --> 1:17:32.340
 I hope I'm not wrong in saying it's a name.

1:17:32.340 --> 1:17:35.140
 In your book, you have calling different things

1:17:35.140 --> 1:17:37.860
 by the same name as one of the things

1:17:37.860 --> 1:17:40.380
 in the beautiful map that opens the book.

1:17:40.380 --> 1:17:42.040
 Yes, and this is a perfect example.

1:17:42.040 --> 1:17:44.100
 So this is another phrase of Poincare,

1:17:44.100 --> 1:17:46.780
 this like incredible generator of slogans and aphorisms.

1:17:46.780 --> 1:17:47.900
 He said, mathematics is the art

1:17:47.900 --> 1:17:49.860
 of calling different things by the same name.

1:17:49.860 --> 1:17:52.500
 That very thing we do, right?

1:17:52.500 --> 1:17:53.980
 When we're like this triangle and this triangle,

1:17:53.980 --> 1:17:55.040
 come on, they're the same triangle,

1:17:55.040 --> 1:17:56.500
 they're just in a different place, right?

1:17:56.500 --> 1:18:00.420
 So in the same way, it came to be understood

1:18:00.420 --> 1:18:04.140
 that the kinds of objects that you study

1:18:06.900 --> 1:18:10.180
 when you study Fermat's Last Theorem,

1:18:10.180 --> 1:18:12.100
 and let's not even be too careful

1:18:12.100 --> 1:18:13.700
 about what these objects are.

1:18:13.700 --> 1:18:15.780
 I can tell you there are gaol representations

1:18:15.780 --> 1:18:18.420
 in modular forms, but saying those words

1:18:18.420 --> 1:18:19.700
 is not gonna mean so much.

1:18:19.700 --> 1:18:23.740
 But whatever they are, they're things that can be deformed,

1:18:23.740 --> 1:18:25.940
 moved around a little bit.

1:18:25.940 --> 1:18:28.460
 And I think the insight of what Andrew

1:18:28.460 --> 1:18:31.300
 and then Andrew and Richard were able to do

1:18:31.300 --> 1:18:33.700
 was to say something like this.

1:18:33.700 --> 1:18:36.680
 A deformation means moving something just a tiny bit,

1:18:36.680 --> 1:18:38.140
 like an infinitesimal amount.

1:18:39.380 --> 1:18:41.460
 If you really are good at understanding

1:18:41.460 --> 1:18:44.700
 which ways a thing can move in a tiny, tiny, tiny,

1:18:44.700 --> 1:18:46.760
 infinitesimal amount in certain directions,

1:18:46.760 --> 1:18:49.260
 maybe you can piece that information together

1:18:49.260 --> 1:18:52.500
 to understand the whole global space in which it can move.

1:18:52.500 --> 1:18:54.420
 And essentially, their argument comes down

1:18:54.420 --> 1:18:57.320
 to showing that two of those big global spaces

1:18:57.320 --> 1:19:00.060
 are actually the same, the fabled R equals T,

1:19:00.060 --> 1:19:03.360
 part of their proof, which is at the heart of it.

1:19:05.220 --> 1:19:09.540
 And it involves this very careful principle like that.

1:19:09.540 --> 1:19:11.860
 But that being said, what I just said,

1:19:12.900 --> 1:19:14.620
 it's probably not what you're thinking,

1:19:14.620 --> 1:19:16.300
 because what you're thinking when you think,

1:19:16.300 --> 1:19:18.500
 oh, I have a point in space and I move it around

1:19:18.500 --> 1:19:19.700
 like a little tiny bit,

1:19:22.220 --> 1:19:26.720
 you're using your notion of distance

1:19:26.720 --> 1:19:28.300
 that's from calculus.

1:19:28.300 --> 1:19:29.540
 We know what it means for like two points

1:19:29.540 --> 1:19:32.960
 on the real line to be close together.

1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:37.080
 So yet another thing that comes up in the book a lot

1:19:37.080 --> 1:19:41.180
 is this fact that the notion of distance

1:19:41.180 --> 1:19:42.620
 is not given to us by God.

1:19:42.620 --> 1:19:44.620
 We could mean a lot of different things by distance.

1:19:44.620 --> 1:19:46.500
 And just in the English language, we do that all the time.

1:19:46.500 --> 1:19:49.020
 We talk about somebody being a close relative.

1:19:49.020 --> 1:19:51.060
 It doesn't mean they live next door to you, right?

1:19:51.060 --> 1:19:52.780
 It means something else.

1:19:52.780 --> 1:19:54.840
 There's a different notion of distance we have in mind.

1:19:54.840 --> 1:19:57.500
 And there are lots of notions of distances

1:19:57.500 --> 1:19:58.820
 that you could use.

1:19:58.820 --> 1:20:01.540
 In the natural language processing community and AI,

1:20:01.540 --> 1:20:04.120
 there might be some notion of semantic distance

1:20:04.120 --> 1:20:06.340
 or lexical distance between two words.

1:20:06.340 --> 1:20:08.740
 How much do they tend to arise in the same context?

1:20:08.740 --> 1:20:13.440
 That's incredibly important for doing autocomplete

1:20:13.440 --> 1:20:15.440
 and like machine translation and stuff like that.

1:20:15.440 --> 1:20:16.380
 And it doesn't have anything to do with

1:20:16.380 --> 1:20:17.940
 are they next to each other in the dictionary, right?

1:20:17.940 --> 1:20:19.260
 It's a different kind of distance.

1:20:19.260 --> 1:20:20.100
 Okay, ready?

1:20:20.100 --> 1:20:21.840
 In this kind of number theory,

1:20:21.840 --> 1:20:25.100
 there was a crazy distance called the peatic distance.

1:20:25.100 --> 1:20:26.740
 I didn't write about this that much in the book

1:20:26.740 --> 1:20:27.580
 because even though I love it

1:20:27.580 --> 1:20:28.620
 and it's a big part of my research life,

1:20:28.620 --> 1:20:29.740
 it gets a little bit into the weeds,

1:20:29.740 --> 1:20:32.500
 but your listeners are gonna hear about it now.

1:20:32.500 --> 1:20:33.340
 Please.

1:20:34.340 --> 1:20:35.900
 What a normal person says

1:20:35.900 --> 1:20:37.700
 when they say two numbers are close,

1:20:37.700 --> 1:20:40.220
 they say like their difference is like a small number,

1:20:40.220 --> 1:20:41.660
 like seven and eight are close

1:20:41.660 --> 1:20:44.300
 because their difference is one and one's pretty small.

1:20:44.300 --> 1:20:48.580
 If we were to be what's called a two attic number theorist,

1:20:48.580 --> 1:20:50.900
 we'd say, oh, two numbers are close

1:20:50.900 --> 1:20:54.180
 if their difference is a multiple of a large power of two.

1:20:55.660 --> 1:21:00.660
 So like one and 49 are close

1:21:00.940 --> 1:21:02.980
 because their difference is 48

1:21:02.980 --> 1:21:04.820
 and 48 is a multiple of 16,

1:21:04.820 --> 1:21:06.700
 which is a pretty large power of two.

1:21:06.700 --> 1:21:09.700
 Whereas one and two are pretty far away

1:21:09.700 --> 1:21:12.460
 because the difference between them is one,

1:21:12.460 --> 1:21:14.260
 which is not even a multiple of a power of two at all.

1:21:14.260 --> 1:21:15.620
 That's odd.

1:21:15.620 --> 1:21:17.700
 You wanna know what's really far from one?

1:21:17.700 --> 1:21:20.540
 Like one and 1 64th

1:21:21.620 --> 1:21:24.700
 because their difference is a negative power of two,

1:21:24.700 --> 1:21:25.660
 two to the minus six.

1:21:25.660 --> 1:21:28.220
 So those points are quite, quite far away.

1:21:28.220 --> 1:21:32.220
 Two to the power of a large N would be two,

1:21:33.740 --> 1:21:35.620
 if that's the difference between two numbers

1:21:35.620 --> 1:21:37.140
 then they're close.

1:21:37.140 --> 1:21:40.140
 Yeah, so two to a large power is in this metric

1:21:40.140 --> 1:21:41.660
 a very small number

1:21:41.660 --> 1:21:44.820
 and two to a negative power is a very big number.

1:21:44.820 --> 1:21:45.660
 That's two attic.

1:21:45.660 --> 1:21:48.700
 Okay, I can't even visualize that.

1:21:48.700 --> 1:21:49.740
 It takes practice.

1:21:49.740 --> 1:21:50.580
 It takes practice.

1:21:50.580 --> 1:21:51.860
 If you've ever heard of the Cantor set,

1:21:51.860 --> 1:21:53.220
 it looks kind of like that.

1:21:54.100 --> 1:21:57.300
 So it is crazy that this is good for anything, right?

1:21:57.300 --> 1:21:58.860
 I mean, this just sounds like a definition

1:21:58.860 --> 1:22:00.660
 that someone would make up to torment you.

1:22:00.660 --> 1:22:05.580
 But what's amazing is there's a general theory of distance

1:22:05.580 --> 1:22:08.380
 where you say any definition you make

1:22:08.380 --> 1:22:11.300
 to satisfy certain axioms deserves to be called a distance

1:22:11.300 --> 1:22:12.140
 and this.

1:22:12.140 --> 1:22:13.860
 See, I'm sorry to interrupt.

1:22:13.860 --> 1:22:15.460
 My brain, you broke my brain.

1:22:15.460 --> 1:22:16.540
 Awesome.

1:22:16.540 --> 1:22:18.100
 10 seconds ago.

1:22:18.100 --> 1:22:21.500
 Cause I'm also starting to map for the two attic case

1:22:21.500 --> 1:22:23.100
 to binary numbers.

1:22:23.100 --> 1:22:25.300
 And you know, cause we romanticize those.

1:22:25.300 --> 1:22:26.140
 So I was trying to.

1:22:26.140 --> 1:22:27.260
 Oh, that's exactly the right way to think of it.

1:22:27.260 --> 1:22:29.500
 I was trying to mess with number,

1:22:29.500 --> 1:22:31.740
 I was trying to see, okay, which ones are close.

1:22:31.740 --> 1:22:33.020
 And then I'm starting to visualize

1:22:33.020 --> 1:22:35.620
 different binary numbers and how they,

1:22:35.620 --> 1:22:37.300
 which ones are close to each other.

1:22:37.300 --> 1:22:38.700
 And I'm not sure.

1:22:38.700 --> 1:22:39.540
 Well, I think there's a.

1:22:39.540 --> 1:22:40.580
 No, no, it's very similar.

1:22:40.580 --> 1:22:41.980
 That's exactly the right way to think of it.

1:22:41.980 --> 1:22:44.580
 It's almost like binary numbers written in reverse.

1:22:44.580 --> 1:22:47.420
 Because in a binary expansion, two numbers are close.

1:22:47.420 --> 1:22:50.860
 A number that's small is like 0.0000 something.

1:22:50.860 --> 1:22:51.700
 Something that's the decimal

1:22:51.700 --> 1:22:53.220
 and it starts with a lot of zeros.

1:22:53.220 --> 1:22:56.860
 In the two attic metric, a binary number is very small

1:22:56.860 --> 1:23:01.700
 if it ends with a lot of zeros and then the decimal point.

1:23:01.700 --> 1:23:02.540
 Gotcha.

1:23:02.540 --> 1:23:04.060
 So it is kind of like binary numbers written backwards

1:23:04.060 --> 1:23:05.100
 is actually, I should have said,

1:23:05.100 --> 1:23:07.420
 that's what I should have said, Lex.

1:23:07.420 --> 1:23:08.780
 That's a very good metaphor.

1:23:08.780 --> 1:23:12.020
 Okay, but so why is that interesting

1:23:12.020 --> 1:23:17.020
 except for the fact that it's a beautiful kind of framework,

1:23:18.380 --> 1:23:19.580
 different kind of framework

1:23:19.580 --> 1:23:20.940
 of which to think about distances.

1:23:20.940 --> 1:23:23.060
 And you're talking about not just the two attic,

1:23:23.060 --> 1:23:24.220
 but the generalization of that.

1:23:24.220 --> 1:23:25.060
 Why is that interesting?

1:23:25.060 --> 1:23:25.900
 Yeah, the NEP.

1:23:25.900 --> 1:23:27.580
 And so that, because that's the kind of deformation

1:23:27.580 --> 1:23:31.700
 that comes up in Wiles's proof,

1:23:31.700 --> 1:23:34.300
 that deformation where moving something a little bit

1:23:34.300 --> 1:23:36.980
 means a little bit in this two attic sense.

1:23:36.980 --> 1:23:38.060
 Trippy, okay.

1:23:38.060 --> 1:23:38.900
 No, I mean, it's such a,

1:23:38.900 --> 1:23:40.020
 I mean, I just get excited talking about it

1:23:40.020 --> 1:23:42.940
 and I just taught this like in the fall semester that.

1:23:43.980 --> 1:23:46.140
 But it like reformulating, why is,

1:23:49.380 --> 1:23:52.780
 so you pick a different measure of distance

1:23:53.740 --> 1:23:56.980
 over which you can talk about very tiny changes

1:23:56.980 --> 1:23:59.660
 and then use that to then prove things

1:23:59.660 --> 1:24:01.380
 about the entire thing.

1:24:02.300 --> 1:24:05.060
 Yes, although, honestly, what I would say,

1:24:05.060 --> 1:24:07.340
 I mean, it's true that we use it to prove things,

1:24:07.340 --> 1:24:09.660
 but I would say we use it to understand things.

1:24:09.660 --> 1:24:11.540
 And then because we understand things better,

1:24:11.540 --> 1:24:12.620
 then we can prove things.

1:24:12.620 --> 1:24:14.300
 But the goal is always the understanding.

1:24:14.300 --> 1:24:16.900
 The goal is not so much to prove things.

1:24:16.900 --> 1:24:18.820
 The goal is not to know what's true or false.

1:24:18.820 --> 1:24:19.860
 I mean, this is something I write about

1:24:19.860 --> 1:24:20.700
 in the book, Near the End.

1:24:20.700 --> 1:24:21.540
 And it's something that,

1:24:21.540 --> 1:24:25.460
 it's a wonderful, wonderful essay by Bill Thurston,

1:24:25.460 --> 1:24:27.100
 kind of one of the great geometers of our time,

1:24:27.100 --> 1:24:29.700
 who unfortunately passed away a few years ago,

1:24:29.700 --> 1:24:32.900
 called on proof and progress in mathematics.

1:24:32.900 --> 1:24:35.380
 And he writes very wonderfully about how,

1:24:35.380 --> 1:24:38.100
 we're not, it's not a theorem factory

1:24:38.100 --> 1:24:39.820
 where you have a production quota.

1:24:39.820 --> 1:24:40.940
 I mean, the point of mathematics

1:24:40.940 --> 1:24:43.580
 is to help humans understand things.

1:24:43.580 --> 1:24:45.300
 And the way we test that

1:24:45.300 --> 1:24:46.900
 is that we're proving new theorems along the way.

1:24:46.900 --> 1:24:49.180
 That's the benchmark, but that's not the goal.

1:24:49.180 --> 1:24:51.580
 Yeah, but just as a kind of, absolutely,

1:24:51.580 --> 1:24:54.100
 but as a tool, it's kind of interesting

1:24:54.100 --> 1:24:56.660
 to approach a problem by saying,

1:24:56.660 --> 1:24:59.780
 how can I change the distance function?

1:24:59.780 --> 1:25:03.700
 Like what, the nature of distance,

1:25:03.700 --> 1:25:07.060
 because that might start to lead to insights

1:25:07.060 --> 1:25:08.420
 for deeper understanding.

1:25:08.420 --> 1:25:12.580
 Like if I were to try to describe human society

1:25:12.580 --> 1:25:15.500
 by a distance, two people are close

1:25:15.500 --> 1:25:17.140
 if they love each other.

1:25:17.140 --> 1:25:17.980
 Right.

1:25:17.980 --> 1:25:21.060
 And then start to do a full analysis

1:25:21.060 --> 1:25:23.820
 on the everybody that lives on earth currently,

1:25:23.820 --> 1:25:25.820
 the 7 billion people.

1:25:25.820 --> 1:25:27.700
 And from that perspective,

1:25:27.700 --> 1:25:30.860
 as opposed to the geographic perspective of distance.

1:25:30.860 --> 1:25:32.980
 And then maybe there could be a bunch of insights

1:25:32.980 --> 1:25:35.580
 about the source of violence,

1:25:35.580 --> 1:25:39.260
 the source of maybe entrepreneurial success

1:25:39.260 --> 1:25:42.980
 or invention or economic success or different systems,

1:25:42.980 --> 1:25:44.660
 communism, capitalism start to,

1:25:44.660 --> 1:25:47.460
 I mean, that's, I guess what economics tries to do,

1:25:47.460 --> 1:25:50.500
 but really saying, okay, let's think outside the box

1:25:50.500 --> 1:25:52.820
 about totally new distance functions

1:25:52.820 --> 1:25:57.220
 that could unlock something profound about the space.

1:25:57.220 --> 1:25:58.060
 Yeah, because think about it.

1:25:58.060 --> 1:26:01.180
 Okay, here's, I mean, now we're gonna talk about AI,

1:26:01.180 --> 1:26:02.980
 which you know a lot more about than I do.

1:26:02.980 --> 1:26:05.820
 So just start laughing uproariously

1:26:05.820 --> 1:26:07.060
 if I say something that's completely wrong.

1:26:07.060 --> 1:26:09.860
 We both know very little relative

1:26:09.860 --> 1:26:12.620
 to what we will know centuries from now.

1:26:12.620 --> 1:26:15.700
 That is a really good humble way to think about it.

1:26:15.700 --> 1:26:16.540
 I like it.

1:26:16.540 --> 1:26:18.340
 Okay, so let's just go for it.

1:26:18.340 --> 1:26:20.500
 Okay, so I think you'll agree with this,

1:26:20.500 --> 1:26:23.020
 that in some sense, what's good about AI

1:26:23.020 --> 1:26:26.340
 is that we can't test any case in advance,

1:26:26.340 --> 1:26:27.820
 the whole point of AI is to make,

1:26:27.820 --> 1:26:30.540
 or one point of it, I guess, is to make good predictions

1:26:30.540 --> 1:26:32.620
 about cases we haven't yet seen.

1:26:32.620 --> 1:26:34.820
 And in some sense, that's always gonna involve

1:26:34.820 --> 1:26:35.980
 some notion of distance,

1:26:35.980 --> 1:26:37.860
 because it's always gonna involve

1:26:37.860 --> 1:26:40.060
 somehow taking a case we haven't seen

1:26:40.060 --> 1:26:43.860
 and saying what cases that we have seen is it close to,

1:26:43.860 --> 1:26:46.820
 is it like, is it somehow an interpolation between.

1:26:47.820 --> 1:26:49.140
 Now, when we do that,

1:26:49.140 --> 1:26:52.020
 in order to talk about things being like other things,

1:26:52.020 --> 1:26:53.460
 implicitly or explicitly,

1:26:53.460 --> 1:26:55.580
 we're invoking some notion of distance,

1:26:55.580 --> 1:26:57.620
 and boy, we better get it right.

1:26:57.620 --> 1:26:59.220
 If you try to do natural language processing

1:26:59.220 --> 1:27:01.220
 and your idea of distance between words

1:27:01.220 --> 1:27:03.180
 is how close they are in the dictionary,

1:27:03.180 --> 1:27:04.460
 when you write them in alphabetical order,

1:27:04.460 --> 1:27:08.180
 you are gonna get pretty bad translations, right?

1:27:08.180 --> 1:27:11.580
 No, the notion of distance has to come from somewhere else.

1:27:11.580 --> 1:27:14.180
 Yeah, that's essentially what neural networks are doing,

1:27:14.180 --> 1:27:17.340
 that's what word embeddings are doing is coming up with.

1:27:17.340 --> 1:27:18.980
 In the case of word embeddings, literally,

1:27:18.980 --> 1:27:21.020
 literally what they are doing is learning a distance.

1:27:21.020 --> 1:27:23.620
 But those are super complicated distance functions,

1:27:23.620 --> 1:27:26.220
 and it's almost nice to think

1:27:26.220 --> 1:27:31.220
 maybe there's a nice transformation that's simple.

1:27:31.500 --> 1:27:34.460
 Sorry, there's a nice formulation of the distance.

1:27:34.460 --> 1:27:36.540
 Again with the simple.

1:27:36.540 --> 1:27:39.740
 So you don't, let me ask you about this.

1:27:41.380 --> 1:27:43.380
 From an understanding perspective,

1:27:43.380 --> 1:27:45.620
 there's the Richard Feynman, maybe attributed to him,

1:27:45.620 --> 1:27:47.340
 but maybe many others,

1:27:48.780 --> 1:27:52.460
 is this idea that if you can't explain something simply

1:27:52.460 --> 1:27:54.100
 that you don't understand it.

1:27:56.380 --> 1:28:00.700
 In how many cases, how often is that true?

1:28:00.700 --> 1:28:03.100
 Do you find there's some profound truth in that?

1:28:05.580 --> 1:28:07.700
 Oh, okay, so you were about to ask, is it true?

1:28:07.700 --> 1:28:09.300
 To which I would say flatly, no.

1:28:09.300 --> 1:28:11.260
 But then you said, you followed that up with,

1:28:11.260 --> 1:28:13.220
 is there some profound truth in it?

1:28:13.220 --> 1:28:14.140
 And I'm like, okay, sure.

1:28:14.140 --> 1:28:15.420
 So there's some truth in it.

1:28:15.420 --> 1:28:16.740
 It's not true. But it's not true.

1:28:16.740 --> 1:28:17.740
 It's just not.

1:28:17.740 --> 1:28:22.740
 That's such a mathematician answer.

1:28:22.820 --> 1:28:25.740
 The truth that is in it is that learning

1:28:25.740 --> 1:28:29.980
 to explain something helps you understand it.

1:28:29.980 --> 1:28:32.600
 But real things are not simple.

1:28:33.460 --> 1:28:36.660
 A few things are, most are not.

1:28:36.660 --> 1:28:40.140
 And to be honest, we don't really know

1:28:40.140 --> 1:28:41.300
 whether Feynman really said that right

1:28:41.300 --> 1:28:43.060
 or something like that is sort of disputed.

1:28:43.060 --> 1:28:46.180
 But I don't think Feynman could have literally believed that

1:28:46.180 --> 1:28:47.220
 whether or not he said it.

1:28:47.220 --> 1:28:49.620
 And he was the kind of guy, I didn't know him,

1:28:49.620 --> 1:28:51.380
 but I've been reading his writing,

1:28:51.380 --> 1:28:55.020
 he liked to sort of say stuff, like stuff that sounded good.

1:28:55.020 --> 1:28:55.860
 You know what I mean?

1:28:55.860 --> 1:28:57.640
 So it's totally strikes me as the kind of thing

1:28:57.640 --> 1:29:00.200
 he could have said because he liked the way saying it

1:29:00.200 --> 1:29:02.980
 made him feel, but also knowing

1:29:02.980 --> 1:29:04.500
 that he didn't like literally mean it.

1:29:04.500 --> 1:29:07.780
 Well, I definitely have a lot of friends

1:29:07.780 --> 1:29:09.540
 and I've talked to a lot of physicists

1:29:09.540 --> 1:29:12.740
 and they do derive joy from believing

1:29:12.740 --> 1:29:14.540
 that they can explain stuff simply

1:29:14.540 --> 1:29:17.820
 or believing it's possible to explain stuff simply,

1:29:17.820 --> 1:29:20.180
 even when the explanation is not actually that simple.

1:29:20.180 --> 1:29:23.940
 Like I've heard people think that the explanation is simple

1:29:23.940 --> 1:29:25.060
 and they do the explanation.

1:29:25.060 --> 1:29:27.600
 And I think it is simple,

1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:30.580
 but it's not capturing the phenomena that we're discussing.

1:29:30.580 --> 1:29:33.060
 It's capturing, it's somehow maps in their mind,

1:29:33.060 --> 1:29:35.980
 but it's taking as a starting point,

1:29:35.980 --> 1:29:38.180
 as an assumption that there's a deep knowledge

1:29:38.180 --> 1:29:41.780
 and a deep understanding that's actually very complicated.

1:29:41.780 --> 1:29:45.220
 And the simplicity is almost like a poem

1:29:45.220 --> 1:29:46.820
 about the more complicated thing

1:29:46.820 --> 1:29:48.700
 as opposed to a distillation.

1:29:48.700 --> 1:29:51.860
 And I love poems, but a poem is not an explanation.

1:29:51.860 --> 1:29:55.540
 Well, some people might disagree with that,

1:29:55.540 --> 1:29:57.460
 but certainly from a mathematical perspective.

1:29:57.460 --> 1:29:59.580
 No poet would disagree with it.

1:29:59.580 --> 1:30:01.220
 No poet would disagree.

1:30:01.220 --> 1:30:02.760
 You don't think there's some things

1:30:02.760 --> 1:30:06.520
 that can only be described imprecisely?

1:30:06.520 --> 1:30:07.500
 As an explanation.

1:30:07.500 --> 1:30:09.700
 I don't think any poet would say their poem

1:30:09.700 --> 1:30:10.540
 is an explanation.

1:30:10.540 --> 1:30:11.820
 They might say it's a description.

1:30:11.820 --> 1:30:14.440
 They might say it's sort of capturing sort of.

1:30:14.440 --> 1:30:17.680
 Well, some people might say the only truth is like music.

1:30:20.060 --> 1:30:20.940
 Not the only truth,

1:30:20.940 --> 1:30:23.580
 but some truths can only be expressed through art.

1:30:24.820 --> 1:30:26.380
 And I mean, that's the whole thing

1:30:26.380 --> 1:30:27.700
 we're talking about religion and myth.

1:30:27.700 --> 1:30:28.880
 And there's some things

1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:32.340
 that are limited cognitive capabilities

1:30:32.340 --> 1:30:35.180
 and the tools of mathematics or the tools of physics

1:30:35.180 --> 1:30:37.340
 are just not going to allow us to capture.

1:30:37.340 --> 1:30:39.900
 Like it's possible consciousness is one of those things.

1:30:39.900 --> 1:30:40.740
 And.

1:30:42.740 --> 1:30:44.600
 Yes, that is definitely possible.

1:30:44.600 --> 1:30:46.100
 But I would even say,

1:30:46.100 --> 1:30:47.500
 look, I mean, consciousness is a thing about

1:30:47.500 --> 1:30:48.440
 which we're still in the dark

1:30:48.440 --> 1:30:50.420
 as to whether there's an explanation

1:30:50.420 --> 1:30:53.620
 we would understand it as an explanation at all.

1:30:53.620 --> 1:30:54.440
 By the way, okay.

1:30:54.440 --> 1:30:56.340
 I got to give yet one more amazing Poincare quote

1:30:56.340 --> 1:30:57.700
 because this guy just never stopped coming up

1:30:57.700 --> 1:30:58.900
 with great quotes that,

1:31:00.660 --> 1:31:02.820
 Paul Erdős, another fellow who appears in the book.

1:31:02.820 --> 1:31:03.660
 And by the way,

1:31:03.660 --> 1:31:05.520
 he thinks about this notion of distance

1:31:05.520 --> 1:31:07.540
 of like personal affinity,

1:31:07.540 --> 1:31:08.540
 kind of like what you're talking about,

1:31:08.540 --> 1:31:11.260
 the kind of social network and that notion of distance

1:31:11.260 --> 1:31:12.100
 that comes from that.

1:31:12.100 --> 1:31:13.300
 So that's something that Paul Erdős.

1:31:13.300 --> 1:31:14.340
 Erdős did?

1:31:14.340 --> 1:31:16.020
 Well, he thought about distances and networks.

1:31:16.020 --> 1:31:16.840
 I guess he didn't probably,

1:31:16.840 --> 1:31:17.680
 he didn't think about the social network.

1:31:17.680 --> 1:31:18.520
 Oh, that's fascinating.

1:31:18.520 --> 1:31:20.100
 And that's how it started that story of Erdős number.

1:31:20.100 --> 1:31:20.940
 Yeah, okay.

1:31:20.940 --> 1:31:22.700
 It's hard to distract.

1:31:22.700 --> 1:31:25.100
 But you know, Erdős was sort of famous for saying,

1:31:25.100 --> 1:31:26.860
 and this is sort of long lines we're saying,

1:31:26.860 --> 1:31:28.420
 he talked about the book,

1:31:28.420 --> 1:31:31.340
 capital T, capital B, the book.

1:31:31.340 --> 1:31:33.460
 And that's the book where God keeps the right proof

1:31:33.460 --> 1:31:34.740
 of every theorem.

1:31:34.740 --> 1:31:36.380
 So when he saw a proof he really liked,

1:31:36.380 --> 1:31:38.020
 it was like really elegant, really simple.

1:31:38.020 --> 1:31:39.100
 Like that's from the book.

1:31:39.100 --> 1:31:42.020
 That's like you found one of the ones that's in the book.

1:31:43.180 --> 1:31:44.680
 He wasn't a religious guy, by the way.

1:31:44.680 --> 1:31:46.900
 He referred to God as the supreme fascist.

1:31:46.900 --> 1:31:48.800
 He was like, but somehow he was like,

1:31:48.800 --> 1:31:49.720
 I don't really believe in God,

1:31:49.720 --> 1:31:50.740
 but I believe in God's book.

1:31:50.740 --> 1:31:51.580
 I mean, it was,

1:31:53.300 --> 1:31:54.960
 but Poincare on the other hand,

1:31:55.980 --> 1:31:57.020
 and by the way, there were other managers.

1:31:57.020 --> 1:31:58.700
 Hilda Hudson is one who comes up in this book.

1:31:58.700 --> 1:32:00.780
 She also kind of saw math.

1:32:01.800 --> 1:32:03.900
 She's one of the people who sort of develops

1:32:05.300 --> 1:32:06.880
 the disease model that we now use,

1:32:06.880 --> 1:32:08.380
 that we use to sort of track pandemics,

1:32:08.380 --> 1:32:10.380
 this SIR model that sort of originally comes

1:32:10.380 --> 1:32:11.940
 from her work with Ronald Ross.

1:32:11.940 --> 1:32:14.500
 But she was also super, super, super devout.

1:32:14.500 --> 1:32:17.380
 And she also sort of on the other side

1:32:17.380 --> 1:32:18.320
 of the religious coin was like,

1:32:18.320 --> 1:32:20.460
 yeah, math is how we communicate with God.

1:32:20.460 --> 1:32:21.300
 She has a great,

1:32:21.300 --> 1:32:22.560
 all these people are incredibly quotable.

1:32:22.560 --> 1:32:24.680
 She says, you know, math is,

1:32:24.680 --> 1:32:26.620
 the truth, the things about mathematics,

1:32:26.620 --> 1:32:29.460
 she's like, they're not the most important of God thoughts,

1:32:29.460 --> 1:32:32.620
 but they're the only ones that we can know precisely.

1:32:32.620 --> 1:32:34.020
 So she's like, this is the one place

1:32:34.020 --> 1:32:35.460
 where we get to sort of see what God's thinking

1:32:35.460 --> 1:32:37.380
 when we do mathematics.

1:32:37.380 --> 1:32:39.160
 Again, not a fan of poetry or music.

1:32:39.160 --> 1:32:41.020
 Some people will say Hendrix is like,

1:32:41.020 --> 1:32:44.340
 some people say chapter one of that book is mathematics,

1:32:44.340 --> 1:32:46.860
 and then chapter two is like classic rock.

1:32:46.860 --> 1:32:48.580
 Right?

1:32:48.580 --> 1:32:51.380
 So like, it's not clear that the...

1:32:51.380 --> 1:32:52.740
 I'm sorry, you just sent me off on a tangent,

1:32:52.740 --> 1:32:54.940
 just imagining like Erdos at a Hendrix concert,

1:32:54.940 --> 1:32:58.500
 like trying to figure out if it was from the book or not.

1:32:59.740 --> 1:33:00.980
 What I was coming to was just to say,

1:33:00.980 --> 1:33:03.100
 but what Poincaré said about this is he's like,

1:33:03.100 --> 1:33:07.400
 you know, if like, this is all worked out

1:33:07.400 --> 1:33:08.460
 in the language of the divine,

1:33:08.460 --> 1:33:12.460
 and if a divine being like came down and told it to us,

1:33:12.460 --> 1:33:15.020
 we wouldn't be able to understand it, so it doesn't matter.

1:33:15.020 --> 1:33:17.400
 So Poincaré was of the view that there were things

1:33:17.400 --> 1:33:19.340
 that were sort of like inhumanly complex,

1:33:19.340 --> 1:33:21.060
 and that was how they really were.

1:33:21.060 --> 1:33:23.780
 Our job is to figure out the things that are not like that.

1:33:23.780 --> 1:33:25.600
 That are not like that.

1:33:25.600 --> 1:33:28.500
 All this talk of primes got me hungry for primes.

1:33:29.380 --> 1:33:32.580
 You wrote a blog post, The Beauty of Bounding Gaps,

1:33:32.580 --> 1:33:35.260
 a huge discovery about prime numbers

1:33:35.260 --> 1:33:37.300
 and what it means for the future of math.

1:33:39.140 --> 1:33:40.820
 Can you tell me about prime numbers?

1:33:40.820 --> 1:33:41.860
 What the heck are those?

1:33:41.860 --> 1:33:42.820
 What are twin primes?

1:33:42.820 --> 1:33:43.740
 What are prime gaps?

1:33:43.740 --> 1:33:46.760
 What are bounding gaps and primes?

1:33:46.760 --> 1:33:47.820
 What are all these things?

1:33:47.820 --> 1:33:49.820
 And what, if anything,

1:33:49.820 --> 1:33:52.100
 or what exactly is beautiful about them?

1:33:52.100 --> 1:33:57.100
 Yeah, so, you know, prime numbers are one of the things

1:33:57.100 --> 1:34:02.100
 that number theorists study the most and have for millennia.

1:34:02.820 --> 1:34:06.220
 They are numbers which can't be factored.

1:34:06.220 --> 1:34:08.140
 And then you say, like, five.

1:34:08.140 --> 1:34:09.780
 And then you're like, wait, I can factor five.

1:34:09.780 --> 1:34:11.820
 Five is five times one.

1:34:11.820 --> 1:34:13.500
 Okay, not like that.

1:34:13.500 --> 1:34:14.540
 That is a factorization.

1:34:14.540 --> 1:34:16.700
 It absolutely is a way of expressing five

1:34:16.700 --> 1:34:18.380
 as a product of two things.

1:34:18.380 --> 1:34:20.900
 But don't you agree there's like something trivial about it?

1:34:20.900 --> 1:34:22.300
 It's something you could do to any number.

1:34:22.300 --> 1:34:24.340
 It doesn't have content the way that if I say

1:34:24.340 --> 1:34:27.640
 that 12 is six times two or 35 is seven times five,

1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:28.960
 I've really done something to it.

1:34:28.960 --> 1:34:29.800
 I've broken up.

1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:31.700
 So those are the kind of factorizations that count.

1:34:31.700 --> 1:34:34.460
 And a number that doesn't have a factorization like that

1:34:34.460 --> 1:34:38.100
 is called prime, except, historical side note,

1:34:38.100 --> 1:34:42.440
 one, which at some times in mathematical history

1:34:42.440 --> 1:34:46.040
 has been deemed to be a prime, but currently is not.

1:34:46.040 --> 1:34:47.140
 And I think that's for the best.

1:34:47.140 --> 1:34:49.580
 But I bring it up only because sometimes people think that,

1:34:49.580 --> 1:34:52.220
 you know, these definitions are kind of,

1:34:52.220 --> 1:34:53.500
 if we think about them hard enough,

1:34:53.500 --> 1:34:55.640
 we can figure out which definition is true.

1:34:56.780 --> 1:34:57.620
 No.

1:34:57.620 --> 1:34:58.820
 There's just an artifact of mathematics.

1:34:58.820 --> 1:35:03.460
 So it's a question of which definition is best for us,

1:35:03.460 --> 1:35:04.300
 for our purposes.

1:35:04.300 --> 1:35:06.020
 Well, those edge cases are weird, right?

1:35:06.020 --> 1:35:11.020
 So it can't be, it doesn't count when you use yourself

1:35:11.700 --> 1:35:15.000
 as a number or one as part of the factorization

1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:17.320
 or as the entirety of the factorization.

1:35:19.320 --> 1:35:22.920
 So you somehow get to the meat of the number

1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:24.180
 by factorizing it.

1:35:24.180 --> 1:35:27.420
 And that seems to get to the core of all of mathematics.

1:35:27.420 --> 1:35:29.940
 Yeah, you take any number and you factorize it

1:35:29.940 --> 1:35:31.440
 until you can factorize no more.

1:35:31.440 --> 1:35:33.900
 And what you have left is some big pile of primes.

1:35:33.900 --> 1:35:36.380
 I mean, by definition, when you can't factor anymore,

1:35:36.380 --> 1:35:39.020
 when you're done, when you can't break the numbers up

1:35:39.020 --> 1:35:40.900
 anymore, what's left must be prime.

1:35:40.900 --> 1:35:44.460
 You know, 12 breaks into two and two and three.

1:35:45.580 --> 1:35:48.220
 So these numbers are the atoms, the building blocks

1:35:48.220 --> 1:35:49.380
 of all numbers.

1:35:50.760 --> 1:35:52.180
 And there's a lot we know about them,

1:35:52.180 --> 1:35:53.420
 or there's much more that we don't know about them.

1:35:53.420 --> 1:35:54.340
 I'll tell you the first few.

1:35:54.340 --> 1:35:58.160
 There's two, three, five, seven, 11.

1:35:59.140 --> 1:36:00.780
 By the way, they're all gonna be odd from then on

1:36:00.780 --> 1:36:02.020
 because if they were even, I could factor out

1:36:02.020 --> 1:36:03.060
 two out of them.

1:36:03.060 --> 1:36:04.300
 But it's not all the odd numbers.

1:36:04.300 --> 1:36:06.440
 Nine isn't prime because it's three times three.

1:36:06.440 --> 1:36:08.180
 15 isn't prime because it's three times five,

1:36:08.180 --> 1:36:09.000
 but 13 is.

1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:09.840
 Where were we?

1:36:09.840 --> 1:36:13.820
 Two, three, five, seven, 11, 13, 17, 19.

1:36:13.820 --> 1:36:15.940
 Not 21, but 23 is, et cetera, et cetera.

1:36:15.940 --> 1:36:17.060
 Okay, so you could go on.

1:36:17.060 --> 1:36:19.580
 How high could you go if we were just sitting here?

1:36:19.580 --> 1:36:20.980
 By the way, your own brain.

1:36:20.980 --> 1:36:23.980
 If continuous, without interruption,

1:36:23.980 --> 1:36:25.980
 would you be able to go over 100?

1:36:25.980 --> 1:36:27.140
 I think so.

1:36:27.140 --> 1:36:29.100
 There's always those ones that trip people up.

1:36:29.100 --> 1:36:31.780
 There's a famous one, the Grotendeek prime 57,

1:36:31.780 --> 1:36:33.380
 like sort of Alexander Grotendeek,

1:36:33.380 --> 1:36:35.740
 the great algebraic geometer was sort of giving

1:36:35.740 --> 1:36:38.740
 some lecture involving a choice of a prime in general.

1:36:38.740 --> 1:36:41.500
 And somebody said, can't you just choose a prime?

1:36:41.500 --> 1:36:43.540
 And he said, okay, 57, which is in fact not prime.

1:36:43.540 --> 1:36:45.800
 It's three times 19.

1:36:45.800 --> 1:36:46.640
 Oh, damn.

1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:49.300
 But it was like, I promise you in some circles

1:36:49.300 --> 1:36:50.140
 it's a funny story.

1:36:50.140 --> 1:36:55.140
 But there's a humor in it.

1:36:55.740 --> 1:36:59.220
 Yes, I would say over 100, I definitely don't remember.

1:36:59.220 --> 1:37:02.100
 Like 107, I think, I'm not sure.

1:37:02.100 --> 1:37:03.460
 Okay, like, I mean.

1:37:03.460 --> 1:37:08.460
 So is there a category of like fake primes

1:37:08.900 --> 1:37:12.900
 that are easily mistaken to be prime?

1:37:12.900 --> 1:37:14.660
 Like 57, I wonder.

1:37:14.660 --> 1:37:19.660
 Yeah, so I would say 57 and 51 are definitely

1:37:20.740 --> 1:37:21.900
 like prime offenders.

1:37:21.900 --> 1:37:23.060
 Oh, I didn't do that on purpose.

1:37:23.060 --> 1:37:24.300
 Oh, well done.

1:37:24.300 --> 1:37:25.340
 Didn't do it on purpose.

1:37:25.340 --> 1:37:28.180
 Anyway, they're definitely ones that people,

1:37:28.180 --> 1:37:30.700
 or 91 is another classic, seven times 13.

1:37:30.700 --> 1:37:32.900
 It really feels kind of prime, doesn't it?

1:37:32.900 --> 1:37:34.020
 But it is not.

1:37:34.020 --> 1:37:34.860
 Yeah.

1:37:35.820 --> 1:37:36.900
 But there's also, by the way,

1:37:36.900 --> 1:37:39.600
 but there's also an actual notion of pseudo prime,

1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:41.460
 which is a thing with a formal definition,

1:37:41.460 --> 1:37:43.380
 which is not a psychological thing.

1:37:43.380 --> 1:37:47.540
 It is a prime which passes a primality test

1:37:47.540 --> 1:37:50.380
 devised by Fermat, which is a very good test,

1:37:50.380 --> 1:37:52.540
 which if a number fails this test,

1:37:52.540 --> 1:37:54.580
 it's definitely not prime.

1:37:54.580 --> 1:37:55.600
 And so there was some hope that,

1:37:55.600 --> 1:37:57.280
 oh, maybe if a number passes the test,

1:37:57.280 --> 1:37:58.420
 then it definitely is prime.

1:37:58.420 --> 1:38:00.660
 That would give a very simple criterion for primality.

1:38:00.660 --> 1:38:03.980
 Unfortunately, it's only perfect in one direction.

1:38:03.980 --> 1:38:08.980
 So there are numbers, I want to say 341 is the smallest,

1:38:09.800 --> 1:38:12.380
 which pass the test but are not prime, 341.

1:38:12.380 --> 1:38:14.780
 Is this test easily explainable or no?

1:38:14.780 --> 1:38:15.860
 Yes, actually.

1:38:16.820 --> 1:38:18.300
 Ready, let me give you the simplest version of it.

1:38:18.300 --> 1:38:21.100
 You can dress it up a little bit, but here's the basic idea.

1:38:22.660 --> 1:38:25.180
 I take the number, the mystery number,

1:38:25.180 --> 1:38:27.340
 I raise two to that power.

1:38:29.540 --> 1:38:32.780
 So let's say your mystery number is six.

1:38:32.780 --> 1:38:33.900
 Are you sorry you asked me?

1:38:33.900 --> 1:38:34.740
 Are you ready?

1:38:34.740 --> 1:38:37.140
 No, you're breaking my brain again, but yes.

1:38:37.140 --> 1:38:38.220
 Let's do it.

1:38:38.220 --> 1:38:40.220
 We're going to do a live demonstration.

1:38:40.220 --> 1:38:43.340
 Let's say your number is six.

1:38:43.340 --> 1:38:45.980
 So I'm going to raise two to the sixth power.

1:38:45.980 --> 1:38:46.820
 Okay, so if I were working on it,

1:38:46.820 --> 1:38:48.660
 I'd be like that's two cubes squared,

1:38:48.660 --> 1:38:51.680
 so that's eight times eight, so that's 64.

1:38:51.680 --> 1:38:53.520
 Now we're going to divide by six,

1:38:53.520 --> 1:38:54.980
 but I don't actually care what the quotient is,

1:38:54.980 --> 1:38:56.100
 only the remainder.

1:38:57.300 --> 1:39:01.420
 So let's see, 64 divided by six is,

1:39:01.420 --> 1:39:04.520
 well, there's a quotient of 10, but the remainder is four.

1:39:05.460 --> 1:39:08.640
 So you failed because the answer has to be two.

1:39:08.640 --> 1:39:13.260
 For any prime, let's do it with five, which is prime.

1:39:13.260 --> 1:39:15.580
 Two to the fifth is 32.

1:39:15.580 --> 1:39:20.580
 Divide 32 by five, and you get six with a remainder of two.

1:39:23.100 --> 1:39:24.220
 With a remainder of two, yeah.

1:39:24.220 --> 1:39:26.700
 For seven, two to the seventh is 128.

1:39:26.700 --> 1:39:29.480
 Divide that by seven, and let's see,

1:39:29.480 --> 1:39:32.340
 I think that's seven times 14, is that right?

1:39:32.340 --> 1:39:33.160
 No.

1:39:33.160 --> 1:39:38.160
 Seven times 18 is 126 with a remainder of two, right?

1:39:40.760 --> 1:39:43.360
 128 is a multiple of seven plus two.

1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:46.520
 So if that remainder is not two,

1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:49.480
 then it's definitely not prime.

1:39:49.480 --> 1:39:53.320
 And then if it is, it's likely a prime, but not for sure.

1:39:53.320 --> 1:39:54.660
 It's likely a prime, but not for sure.

1:39:54.660 --> 1:39:56.280
 And there's actually a beautiful geometric proof

1:39:56.280 --> 1:39:57.240
 which is in the book, actually.

1:39:57.240 --> 1:39:58.720
 That's like one of the most granular parts of the book

1:39:58.720 --> 1:40:00.440
 because it's such a beautiful proof, I couldn't not give it.

1:40:00.440 --> 1:40:05.400
 So you draw a lot of like opal and pearl necklaces

1:40:05.400 --> 1:40:06.240
 and spin them.

1:40:06.240 --> 1:40:07.440
 That's kind of the geometric nature

1:40:07.440 --> 1:40:10.000
 of this proof of Fermat's Little Theorem.

1:40:11.920 --> 1:40:13.680
 So yeah, so with pseudo primes,

1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:14.760
 there are primes that are kind of faking it.

1:40:14.760 --> 1:40:16.560
 They pass that test, but there are numbers

1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:17.960
 that are faking it that pass that test,

1:40:17.960 --> 1:40:19.260
 but are not actually prime.

1:40:20.680 --> 1:40:25.680
 But the point is, there are many, many,

1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.900
 many theorems about prime numbers.

1:40:28.900 --> 1:40:32.100
 There's a bunch of questions to ask.

1:40:32.100 --> 1:40:34.660
 Is there an infinite number of primes?

1:40:34.660 --> 1:40:37.460
 Can we say something about the gap between primes

1:40:37.460 --> 1:40:40.940
 as the numbers grow larger and larger and larger and so on?

1:40:40.940 --> 1:40:43.200
 Yeah, it's a perfect example of your desire

1:40:43.200 --> 1:40:44.620
 for simplicity in all things.

1:40:44.620 --> 1:40:46.300
 You know what would be really simple?

1:40:46.300 --> 1:40:48.780
 If there was only finitely many primes

1:40:48.780 --> 1:40:51.540
 and then there would be this finite set of atoms

1:40:51.540 --> 1:40:53.860
 that all numbers would be built up.

1:40:53.860 --> 1:40:56.860
 That would be very simple and good in certain ways,

1:40:56.860 --> 1:40:58.860
 but it's completely false.

1:40:58.860 --> 1:41:00.220
 And number theory would be totally different

1:41:00.220 --> 1:41:01.040
 if that were the case.

1:41:01.040 --> 1:41:01.880
 It's just not true.

1:41:03.180 --> 1:41:04.700
 In fact, this is something else that Euclid knew.

1:41:04.700 --> 1:41:07.540
 So this is a very, very old fact,

1:41:07.540 --> 1:41:10.340
 like much before, long before we've had anything

1:41:10.340 --> 1:41:11.180
 like modern number theory.

1:41:11.180 --> 1:41:12.140
 The primes are infinite.

1:41:12.140 --> 1:41:14.020
 The primes that there are, right.

1:41:14.020 --> 1:41:15.460
 There's an infinite number of primes.

1:41:15.460 --> 1:41:17.740
 So what about the gaps between the primes?

1:41:17.740 --> 1:41:20.460
 Right, so one thing that people recognized

1:41:20.460 --> 1:41:22.220
 and really thought about a lot is that the primes,

1:41:22.220 --> 1:41:25.840
 on average, seem to get farther and farther apart

1:41:25.840 --> 1:41:27.020
 as they get bigger and bigger.

1:41:27.020 --> 1:41:29.140
 In other words, it's less and less common.

1:41:29.140 --> 1:41:31.140
 Like I already told you of the first 10 numbers,

1:41:31.140 --> 1:41:32.940
 two, three, five, seven, four of them are prime.

1:41:32.940 --> 1:41:34.700
 That's a lot, 40%.

1:41:34.700 --> 1:41:38.540
 If I looked at 10 digit numbers,

1:41:38.540 --> 1:41:40.620
 no way would 40% of those be prime.

1:41:40.620 --> 1:41:42.020
 Being prime would be a lot rarer.

1:41:42.020 --> 1:41:43.940
 In some sense, because there's a lot more things

1:41:43.940 --> 1:41:45.860
 for them to be divisible by.

1:41:45.860 --> 1:41:47.140
 That's one way of thinking of it.

1:41:47.140 --> 1:41:49.420
 It's a lot more possible for there to be a factorization

1:41:49.420 --> 1:41:50.380
 because there's a lot of things

1:41:50.380 --> 1:41:52.140
 you can try to factor out of it.

1:41:52.140 --> 1:41:53.420
 As the numbers get bigger and bigger,

1:41:53.420 --> 1:41:58.420
 primality gets rarer and rarer, and the extent

1:41:58.820 --> 1:42:01.700
 to which that's the case, that's pretty well understood.

1:42:01.700 --> 1:42:03.840
 But then you can ask more fine grained questions,

1:42:03.840 --> 1:42:04.880
 and here is one.

1:42:07.900 --> 1:42:11.740
 A twin prime is a pair of primes that are two apart,

1:42:11.740 --> 1:42:16.740
 like three and five, or like 11 and 13, or like 17 and 19.

1:42:17.260 --> 1:42:18.900
 And one thing we still don't know

1:42:18.900 --> 1:42:21.960
 is are there infinitely many of those?

1:42:21.960 --> 1:42:24.100
 We know on average, they get farther and farther apart,

1:42:24.100 --> 1:42:28.140
 but that doesn't mean there couldn't be occasional folks

1:42:28.140 --> 1:42:30.180
 that come close together.

1:42:30.180 --> 1:42:32.940
 And indeed, we think that there are.

1:42:33.820 --> 1:42:36.060
 And one interesting question, I mean, this is,

1:42:37.300 --> 1:42:38.140
 because I think you might say,

1:42:38.140 --> 1:42:41.060
 well, how could one possibly have a right

1:42:41.060 --> 1:42:44.020
 to have an opinion about something like that?

1:42:44.020 --> 1:42:46.380
 We don't have any way of describing a process

1:42:46.380 --> 1:42:48.460
 that makes primes.

1:42:49.540 --> 1:42:51.480
 Sure, you can look at your computer

1:42:51.480 --> 1:42:53.860
 and see a lot of them, but the fact that there's a lot,

1:42:53.860 --> 1:42:55.940
 why is that evidence that there's infinitely many, right?

1:42:55.940 --> 1:42:57.660
 Maybe I can go on the computer and find 10 million.

1:42:57.660 --> 1:42:59.940
 Well, 10 million is pretty far from infinity, right?

1:42:59.940 --> 1:43:01.620
 So how is that evidence?

1:43:01.620 --> 1:43:02.520
 There's a lot of things.

1:43:02.520 --> 1:43:04.180
 There's like a lot more than 10 million atoms.

1:43:04.180 --> 1:43:05.500
 That doesn't mean there's infinitely many atoms

1:43:05.500 --> 1:43:06.340
 in the universe, right?

1:43:06.340 --> 1:43:07.740
 I mean, on most people's physical theories,

1:43:07.740 --> 1:43:10.180
 there's probably not, as I understand it.

1:43:10.180 --> 1:43:13.240
 Okay, so why would we think this?

1:43:13.240 --> 1:43:17.460
 The answer is that it turns out to be like incredibly

1:43:17.460 --> 1:43:21.840
 productive and enlightening to think about primes

1:43:21.840 --> 1:43:23.260
 as if they were random numbers,

1:43:23.260 --> 1:43:24.900
 as if they were randomly distributed

1:43:24.900 --> 1:43:26.060
 according to a certain law.

1:43:26.060 --> 1:43:27.740
 Now they're not, they're not random.

1:43:27.740 --> 1:43:28.740
 There's no chance involved.

1:43:28.740 --> 1:43:30.140
 There it's completely deterministic

1:43:30.140 --> 1:43:31.620
 whether a number is prime or not.

1:43:31.620 --> 1:43:35.420
 And yet it just turns out to be phenomenally useful

1:43:35.420 --> 1:43:38.100
 in mathematics to say,

1:43:38.100 --> 1:43:41.740
 even if something is governed by a deterministic law,

1:43:41.740 --> 1:43:43.100
 let's just pretend it wasn't.

1:43:43.100 --> 1:43:44.460
 Let's just pretend that they were produced

1:43:44.460 --> 1:43:46.560
 by some random process and see if the behavior

1:43:46.560 --> 1:43:47.940
 is roughly the same.

1:43:47.940 --> 1:43:49.620
 And if it's not, maybe change the random process,

1:43:49.620 --> 1:43:51.100
 maybe make the randomness a little bit different

1:43:51.100 --> 1:43:53.820
 and tweak it and see if you can find a random process

1:43:53.820 --> 1:43:55.380
 that matches the behavior we see.

1:43:55.380 --> 1:43:58.460
 And then maybe you predict that other behaviors

1:44:00.140 --> 1:44:02.900
 of the system are like that of the random process.

1:44:02.900 --> 1:44:04.060
 And so that's kind of like, it's funny

1:44:04.060 --> 1:44:05.260
 because I think when you talk to people

1:44:05.260 --> 1:44:07.420
 at the twin prime conjecture,

1:44:07.420 --> 1:44:09.940
 people think you're saying,

1:44:09.940 --> 1:44:12.420
 wow, there's like some deep structure there

1:44:12.420 --> 1:44:15.180
 that like makes those primes be like close together

1:44:15.180 --> 1:44:16.020
 again and again.

1:44:16.020 --> 1:44:18.300
 And no, it's the opposite of deep structure.

1:44:18.300 --> 1:44:20.860
 What we say when we say we believe the twin prime conjecture

1:44:20.860 --> 1:44:22.860
 is that we believe the primes are like sort of

1:44:22.860 --> 1:44:24.580
 strewn around pretty randomly.

1:44:24.580 --> 1:44:26.100
 And if they were, then by chance,

1:44:26.100 --> 1:44:28.180
 you would expect there to be infinitely many twin primes.

1:44:28.180 --> 1:44:29.660
 And we're saying, yeah, we expect them to behave

1:44:29.660 --> 1:44:31.900
 just like they would if they were random dirt.

1:44:33.140 --> 1:44:35.340
 The fascinating parallel here is,

1:44:36.180 --> 1:44:38.420
 I just got a chance to talk to Sam Harris

1:44:38.420 --> 1:44:41.300
 and he uses the prime numbers as an example.

1:44:41.300 --> 1:44:44.940
 Often, I don't know if you're familiar with who Sam is.

1:44:44.940 --> 1:44:49.280
 He uses that as an example of there being no free will.

1:44:50.380 --> 1:44:52.380
 Wait, where does he get this?

1:44:52.380 --> 1:44:54.820
 Well, he just uses as an example of,

1:44:54.820 --> 1:44:58.460
 it might seem like this is a random number generator,

1:44:58.460 --> 1:45:01.780
 but it's all like formally defined.

1:45:01.780 --> 1:45:05.120
 So if we keep getting more and more primes,

1:45:05.120 --> 1:45:09.180
 then like that might feel like a new discovery

1:45:09.180 --> 1:45:12.160
 and that might feel like a new experience, but it's not.

1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:14.340
 It was always written in the cards.

1:45:14.340 --> 1:45:15.700
 But it's funny that you say that

1:45:15.700 --> 1:45:18.320
 because a lot of people think of like randomness,

1:45:19.580 --> 1:45:23.420
 the fundamental randomness within the nature of reality

1:45:23.420 --> 1:45:25.900
 might be the source of something

1:45:25.900 --> 1:45:27.780
 that we experience as free will.

1:45:27.780 --> 1:45:30.180
 And you're saying it's like useful to look at prime numbers

1:45:30.180 --> 1:45:35.180
 as a random process in order to prove stuff about them.

1:45:35.620 --> 1:45:38.820
 But fundamentally, of course, it's not a random process.

1:45:38.820 --> 1:45:40.900
 Well, not in order to prove some stuff about them

1:45:40.900 --> 1:45:43.740
 so much as to figure out what we expect to be true

1:45:43.740 --> 1:45:44.940
 and then try to prove that.

1:45:44.940 --> 1:45:45.900
 Because here's what you don't want to do.

1:45:45.900 --> 1:45:48.340
 Try really hard to prove something that's false.

1:45:48.340 --> 1:45:51.100
 That makes it really hard to prove the thing if it's false.

1:45:51.100 --> 1:45:53.020
 So you certainly want to have some heuristic ways

1:45:53.020 --> 1:45:55.120
 of guessing, making good guesses about what's true.

1:45:55.120 --> 1:45:56.660
 So yeah, here's what I would say.

1:45:56.660 --> 1:45:58.740
 You're going to be imaginary Sam Harris now.

1:45:58.740 --> 1:46:00.980
 Like you are talking about prime numbers

1:46:00.980 --> 1:46:01.860
 and you are like,

1:46:01.860 --> 1:46:04.000
 but prime numbers are completely deterministic.

1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:04.840
 And I'm saying like,

1:46:04.840 --> 1:46:06.940
 well, but let's treat them like a random process.

1:46:06.940 --> 1:46:08.240
 And then you say,

1:46:08.240 --> 1:46:09.580
 but you're just saying something that's not true.

1:46:09.580 --> 1:46:10.900
 They're not a random process, they're deterministic.

1:46:10.900 --> 1:46:11.860
 And I'm like, okay, great.

1:46:11.860 --> 1:46:13.940
 You hold to your insistence that it's not a random process.

1:46:13.940 --> 1:46:15.860
 Meanwhile, I'm generating insight about the primes

1:46:15.860 --> 1:46:17.740
 that you're not because I'm willing to sort of pretend

1:46:17.740 --> 1:46:18.660
 that there's something that they're not

1:46:18.660 --> 1:46:20.440
 in order to understand what's going on.

1:46:20.440 --> 1:46:22.920
 Yeah, so it doesn't matter what the reality is.

1:46:22.920 --> 1:46:27.920
 What matters is what framework of thought

1:46:28.220 --> 1:46:30.780
 results in the maximum number of insights.

1:46:30.780 --> 1:46:32.380
 Yeah, because I feel, look, I'm sorry,

1:46:32.380 --> 1:46:34.180
 but I feel like you have more insights about people.

1:46:34.180 --> 1:46:37.980
 If you think of them as like beings that have wants

1:46:37.980 --> 1:46:40.860
 and needs and desires and do stuff on purpose,

1:46:40.860 --> 1:46:41.820
 even if that's not true,

1:46:41.820 --> 1:46:43.500
 you still understand better what's going on

1:46:43.500 --> 1:46:44.620
 by treating them in that way.

1:46:44.620 --> 1:46:46.480
 Don't you find, look, when you work on machine learning,

1:46:46.480 --> 1:46:48.020
 don't you find yourself sort of talking

1:46:48.020 --> 1:46:51.500
 about what the machine is trying to do

1:46:51.500 --> 1:46:52.780
 in a certain instance?

1:46:52.780 --> 1:46:54.940
 Do you not find yourself drawn to that language?

1:46:54.940 --> 1:46:57.700
 Well, it knows this, it's trying to do that,

1:46:57.700 --> 1:46:58.980
 it's learning that.

1:46:58.980 --> 1:47:00.980
 I'm certainly drawn to that language

1:47:00.980 --> 1:47:03.380
 to the point where I receive quite a bit of criticisms

1:47:03.380 --> 1:47:05.420
 for it because I, you know, like.

1:47:05.420 --> 1:47:07.020
 Oh, I'm on your side, man.

1:47:07.020 --> 1:47:09.740
 So especially in robotics, I don't know why,

1:47:09.740 --> 1:47:14.260
 but robotics people don't like to name their robots.

1:47:14.260 --> 1:47:17.020
 They certainly don't like to gender their robots

1:47:17.020 --> 1:47:18.780
 because the moment you gender a robot,

1:47:18.780 --> 1:47:20.580
 you start to anthropomorphize.

1:47:20.580 --> 1:47:22.940
 If you say he or she, you start to,

1:47:22.940 --> 1:47:27.340
 in your mind, construct like a life story.

1:47:27.340 --> 1:47:29.020
 In your mind, you can't help it.

1:47:29.020 --> 1:47:31.520
 There's like, you create like a humorous story

1:47:31.520 --> 1:47:32.360
 to this person.

1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:35.580
 You start to, this person, this robot,

1:47:35.580 --> 1:47:37.300
 you start to project your own.

1:47:37.300 --> 1:47:38.780
 But I think that's what we do to each other.

1:47:38.780 --> 1:47:40.500
 And I think that's actually really useful

1:47:40.500 --> 1:47:42.620
 for the engineering process,

1:47:42.620 --> 1:47:44.580
 especially for human robot interaction.

1:47:44.580 --> 1:47:46.620
 And yes, for machine learning systems,

1:47:46.620 --> 1:47:48.020
 for helping you build an intuition

1:47:48.020 --> 1:47:49.900
 about a particular problem.

1:47:49.900 --> 1:47:51.920
 It's almost like asking this question,

1:47:53.060 --> 1:47:55.940
 you know, when a machine learning system fails

1:47:55.940 --> 1:47:57.960
 in a particular edge case, asking like,

1:47:57.960 --> 1:47:59.820
 what were you thinking about?

1:47:59.820 --> 1:48:02.020
 Like, like asking, like almost like

1:48:02.020 --> 1:48:04.540
 when you're talking about to a child

1:48:04.540 --> 1:48:08.580
 who just did something bad, you want to understand

1:48:08.580 --> 1:48:12.060
 like what was, how did they see the world?

1:48:12.060 --> 1:48:13.980
 Maybe there's a totally new, maybe you're the one

1:48:13.980 --> 1:48:16.820
 that's thinking about the world incorrectly.

1:48:16.820 --> 1:48:19.900
 And yeah, that anthropomorphization process,

1:48:19.900 --> 1:48:21.380
 I think is ultimately good for insight.

1:48:21.380 --> 1:48:23.620
 And the same is, I agree with you.

1:48:23.620 --> 1:48:26.660
 I tend to believe about free will as well.

1:48:26.660 --> 1:48:28.900
 Let me ask you a ridiculous question, if it's okay.

1:48:28.900 --> 1:48:30.260
 Of course.

1:48:30.260 --> 1:48:34.420
 I've just recently, most people go on like rabbit hole,

1:48:34.420 --> 1:48:35.660
 like YouTube things.

1:48:35.660 --> 1:48:39.820
 And I went on a rabbit hole often do of Wikipedia.

1:48:39.820 --> 1:48:42.580
 And I found a page on

1:48:43.860 --> 1:48:48.860
 finiteism, ultra finiteism and intuitionism

1:48:49.100 --> 1:48:51.180
 or into, I forget what it's called.

1:48:51.180 --> 1:48:52.140
 Yeah, intuitionism.

1:48:52.140 --> 1:48:53.740
 Intuitionism.

1:48:53.740 --> 1:48:55.580
 That seemed pretty, pretty interesting.

1:48:55.580 --> 1:48:58.420
 I have it on my to do list actually like look into

1:48:58.420 --> 1:49:00.820
 like, is there people who like formally attract,

1:49:00.820 --> 1:49:03.600
 like real mathematicians are trying to argue for this.

1:49:03.600 --> 1:49:07.500
 But the belief there, I think, let's say finiteism

1:49:07.500 --> 1:49:10.140
 that infinity is fake.

1:49:11.860 --> 1:49:16.740
 Meaning, infinity might be like a useful hack

1:49:16.740 --> 1:49:18.860
 for certain, like a useful tool in mathematics,

1:49:18.860 --> 1:49:22.460
 but it really gets us into trouble

1:49:22.460 --> 1:49:26.660
 because there's no infinity in the real world.

1:49:26.660 --> 1:49:30.980
 Maybe I'm sort of not expressing that fully correctly,

1:49:30.980 --> 1:49:32.780
 but basically saying like there's things

1:49:32.780 --> 1:49:37.020
 that once you add into mathematics,

1:49:37.020 --> 1:49:41.020
 things that are not provably within the physical world,

1:49:41.020 --> 1:49:45.800
 you're starting to inject to corrupt your framework

1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:46.640
 of reason.

1:49:47.620 --> 1:49:49.180
 What do you think about that?

1:49:49.180 --> 1:49:51.660
 I mean, I think, okay, so first of all, I'm not an expert

1:49:51.660 --> 1:49:54.780
 and I couldn't even tell you what the difference is

1:49:54.780 --> 1:49:58.340
 between those three terms, finiteism, ultra finiteism

1:49:58.340 --> 1:49:59.940
 and intuitionism, although I know they're related

1:49:59.940 --> 1:50:01.620
 and I tend to associate them with the Netherlands

1:50:01.620 --> 1:50:02.620
 in the 1930s.

1:50:02.620 --> 1:50:04.860
 Okay, I'll tell you, can I just quickly comment

1:50:04.860 --> 1:50:06.860
 because I read the Wikipedia page.

1:50:06.860 --> 1:50:07.700
 The difference in ultra.

1:50:07.700 --> 1:50:10.480
 That's like the ultimate sentence of the modern age.

1:50:10.480 --> 1:50:12.620
 Can I just comment because I read the Wikipedia page.

1:50:12.620 --> 1:50:14.660
 That sums up our moment.

1:50:14.660 --> 1:50:16.480
 Bro, I'm basically an expert.

1:50:17.540 --> 1:50:19.700
 Ultra finiteism.

1:50:19.700 --> 1:50:22.860
 So, finiteism says that the only infinity

1:50:22.860 --> 1:50:25.220
 you're allowed to have is that the natural numbers

1:50:25.220 --> 1:50:26.140
 are infinite.

1:50:27.020 --> 1:50:29.240
 So, like those numbers are infinite.

1:50:29.240 --> 1:50:32.200
 So, like one, two, three, four, five,

1:50:32.200 --> 1:50:34.260
 the integers are infinite.

1:50:35.460 --> 1:50:39.560
 The ultra finiteism says, nope, even that infinity is fake.

1:50:41.480 --> 1:50:43.120
 I'll bet ultra finiteism came second.

1:50:43.120 --> 1:50:44.740
 I'll bet it's like when there's like a hardcore scene

1:50:44.740 --> 1:50:47.180
 and then one guy's like, oh, now there's a lot of people

1:50:47.180 --> 1:50:48.020
 in the scene.

1:50:48.020 --> 1:50:49.180
 I have to find a way to be more hardcore

1:50:49.180 --> 1:50:50.180
 than the hardcore people.

1:50:50.180 --> 1:50:52.460
 It's all back to the emo, Doc.

1:50:52.460 --> 1:50:54.780
 Okay, so is there any, are you ever,

1:50:54.780 --> 1:50:58.020
 because I'm often uncomfortable with infinity,

1:50:58.020 --> 1:50:59.700
 like psychologically.

1:50:59.700 --> 1:51:04.620
 I have trouble when that sneaks in there.

1:51:04.620 --> 1:51:06.660
 It's because it works so damn well,

1:51:06.660 --> 1:51:09.340
 I get a little suspicious,

1:51:09.340 --> 1:51:12.580
 because it could be almost like a crutch

1:51:12.580 --> 1:51:15.540
 or an oversimplification that's missing something profound

1:51:15.540 --> 1:51:16.460
 about reality.

1:51:17.500 --> 1:51:20.720
 Well, so first of all, okay, if you say like,

1:51:20.720 --> 1:51:24.900
 is there like a serious way of doing mathematics

1:51:24.900 --> 1:51:29.300
 that doesn't really treat infinity as a real thing

1:51:29.300 --> 1:51:30.600
 or maybe it's kind of agnostic

1:51:30.600 --> 1:51:32.660
 and it's like, I'm not really gonna make a firm statement

1:51:32.660 --> 1:51:33.980
 about whether it's a real thing or not.

1:51:33.980 --> 1:51:36.620
 Yeah, that's called most of the history of mathematics.

1:51:36.620 --> 1:51:41.520
 So it's only after Cantor that we really are sort of,

1:51:41.520 --> 1:51:43.920
 okay, we're gonna like have a notion

1:51:43.920 --> 1:51:45.660
 of like the cardinality of an infinite set

1:51:45.660 --> 1:51:49.100
 and like do something that you might call

1:51:49.100 --> 1:51:51.340
 like the modern theory of infinity.

1:51:51.340 --> 1:51:54.100
 That said, obviously everybody was drawn to this notion

1:51:54.100 --> 1:51:55.800
 and no, not everybody was comfortable with it.

1:51:55.800 --> 1:51:57.700
 Look, I mean, this is what happens with Newton.

1:51:57.700 --> 1:52:01.380
 I mean, so Newton understands that to talk about tangents

1:52:01.380 --> 1:52:03.480
 and to talk about instantaneous velocity,

1:52:04.580 --> 1:52:06.620
 he has to do something that we would now call

1:52:06.620 --> 1:52:08.700
 taking a limit, right?

1:52:08.700 --> 1:52:11.260
 The fabled dy over dx, if you sort of go back

1:52:11.260 --> 1:52:13.100
 to your calculus class, for those who have taken calculus

1:52:13.100 --> 1:52:14.860
 and remember this mysterious thing.

1:52:14.860 --> 1:52:17.360
 And you know, what is it?

1:52:17.360 --> 1:52:18.200
 What is it?

1:52:18.200 --> 1:52:19.740
 Well, he'd say like, well, it's like,

1:52:19.740 --> 1:52:24.060
 you sort of divide the length of this line segment

1:52:24.060 --> 1:52:25.300
 by the length of this other line segment.

1:52:25.300 --> 1:52:26.340
 And then you make them a little shorter

1:52:26.340 --> 1:52:27.180
 and you divide again.

1:52:27.180 --> 1:52:28.100
 And then you make them a little shorter

1:52:28.100 --> 1:52:28.940
 and you divide again.

1:52:28.940 --> 1:52:29.780
 And then you just keep on doing that

1:52:29.780 --> 1:52:30.780
 until they're like infinitely short

1:52:30.780 --> 1:52:32.520
 and then you divide them again.

1:52:32.520 --> 1:52:36.360
 These quantities that are like, they're not zero,

1:52:36.360 --> 1:52:41.360
 but they're also smaller than any actual number,

1:52:42.020 --> 1:52:43.420
 these infinitesimals.

1:52:43.420 --> 1:52:46.380
 Well, people were queasy about it

1:52:46.380 --> 1:52:48.180
 and they weren't wrong to be queasy about it, right?

1:52:48.180 --> 1:52:50.100
 From a modern perspective, it was not really well formed.

1:52:50.100 --> 1:52:52.300
 There's this very famous critique of Newton

1:52:52.300 --> 1:52:54.500
 by Bishop Berkeley, where he says like,

1:52:54.500 --> 1:52:57.820
 what these things you define, like, you know,

1:52:57.820 --> 1:53:00.260
 they're not zero, but they're smaller than any number.

1:53:00.260 --> 1:53:02.420
 Are they the ghosts of departed quantities?

1:53:02.420 --> 1:53:06.860
 That was this like ultra burn of Newton.

1:53:06.860 --> 1:53:10.040
 And on the one hand, he was right.

1:53:10.040 --> 1:53:11.740
 It wasn't really rigorous by modern standards.

1:53:11.740 --> 1:53:14.380
 On the other hand, like Newton was out there doing calculus

1:53:14.380 --> 1:53:15.380
 and other people were not, right?

1:53:15.380 --> 1:53:17.380
 It works, it works.

1:53:17.380 --> 1:53:20.660
 I think a sort of intuitionist view, for instance,

1:53:20.660 --> 1:53:23.620
 I would say would express serious doubt.

1:53:23.620 --> 1:53:25.940
 And by the way, it's not just infinity.

1:53:25.940 --> 1:53:28.100
 It's like saying, I think we would express serious doubt

1:53:28.100 --> 1:53:30.340
 that like the real numbers exist.

1:53:31.320 --> 1:53:36.320
 Now, most people are comfortable with the real numbers.

1:53:36.820 --> 1:53:39.220
 Well, computer scientists with floating point number,

1:53:39.220 --> 1:53:42.740
 I mean, floating point arithmetic.

1:53:42.740 --> 1:53:44.720
 That's a great point, actually.

1:53:44.720 --> 1:53:48.420
 I think in some sense, this flavor of doing math,

1:53:48.420 --> 1:53:51.220
 saying we shouldn't talk about things

1:53:51.220 --> 1:53:53.620
 that we cannot specify in a finite amount of time,

1:53:53.620 --> 1:53:55.980
 there's something very computational in flavor about that.

1:53:55.980 --> 1:53:57.580
 And it's probably not a coincidence

1:53:57.580 --> 1:54:01.740
 that it becomes popular in the 30s and 40s,

1:54:01.740 --> 1:54:04.980
 which is also like kind of like the dawn of ideas

1:54:04.980 --> 1:54:06.180
 about formal computation, right?

1:54:06.180 --> 1:54:07.940
 You probably know the timeline better than I do.

1:54:07.940 --> 1:54:09.620
 Sorry, what becomes popular?

1:54:09.620 --> 1:54:12.200
 These ideas that maybe we should be doing math

1:54:12.200 --> 1:54:16.140
 in this more restrictive way where even a thing that,

1:54:16.140 --> 1:54:18.540
 because look, the origin of all this is like,

1:54:18.540 --> 1:54:22.580
 number represents a magnitude, like the length of a line.

1:54:22.580 --> 1:54:26.060
 So I mean, the idea that there's a continuum,

1:54:26.060 --> 1:54:30.580
 there's sort of like, it's pretty old,

1:54:30.580 --> 1:54:31.900
 but just because something is old

1:54:31.900 --> 1:54:34.220
 doesn't mean we can't reject it if we want to.

1:54:34.220 --> 1:54:36.580
 Well, a lot of the fundamental ideas in computer science,

1:54:36.580 --> 1:54:40.060
 when you talk about the complexity of problems,

1:54:41.380 --> 1:54:45.060
 to Turing himself, they rely on an infinity as well.

1:54:45.060 --> 1:54:47.540
 The ideas that kind of challenge that,

1:54:47.540 --> 1:54:48.780
 the whole space of machine learning,

1:54:48.780 --> 1:54:51.000
 I would say, challenges that.

1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:53.020
 It's almost like the engineering approach to things,

1:54:53.020 --> 1:54:54.660
 like the floating point arithmetic.

1:54:54.660 --> 1:54:57.340
 The other one that, back to John Conway,

1:54:57.340 --> 1:55:00.780
 that challenges this idea,

1:55:00.780 --> 1:55:04.180
 I mean, maybe to tie in the ideas of deformation theory

1:55:06.540 --> 1:55:11.540
 and limits to infinity is this idea of cellular automata

1:55:13.980 --> 1:55:17.340
 with John Conway looking at the game of life,

1:55:17.340 --> 1:55:19.340
 Stephen Wolfram's work,

1:55:19.340 --> 1:55:22.580
 that I've been a big fan of for a while, cellular automata.

1:55:22.580 --> 1:55:23.780
 I was wondering if you have,

1:55:23.780 --> 1:55:26.900
 if you have ever encountered these kinds of objects,

1:55:26.900 --> 1:55:29.320
 you ever looked at them as a mathematician,

1:55:29.320 --> 1:55:34.320
 where you have very simple rules of tiny little objects

1:55:34.840 --> 1:55:37.980
 that when taken as a whole create incredible complexities,

1:55:37.980 --> 1:55:39.820
 but are very difficult to analyze,

1:55:39.820 --> 1:55:41.980
 very difficult to make sense of,

1:55:41.980 --> 1:55:45.120
 even though the one individual object, one part,

1:55:45.120 --> 1:55:47.540
 it's like what we were saying about Andrew Wiles,

1:55:47.540 --> 1:55:49.780
 you can look at the deformation of a small piece

1:55:49.780 --> 1:55:51.340
 to tell you about the whole.

1:55:51.340 --> 1:55:54.460
 It feels like with cellular automata

1:55:54.460 --> 1:55:56.400
 or any kind of complex systems,

1:55:57.340 --> 1:55:59.820
 it's often very difficult to say something

1:55:59.820 --> 1:56:01.620
 about the whole thing,

1:56:01.620 --> 1:56:05.100
 even when you can precisely describe the operation

1:56:05.100 --> 1:56:09.380
 of the local neighborhoods.

1:56:09.380 --> 1:56:10.980
 Yeah, I mean, I love that subject.

1:56:10.980 --> 1:56:12.660
 I haven't really done research on it myself.

1:56:12.660 --> 1:56:13.540
 I've played around with it.

1:56:13.540 --> 1:56:15.060
 I'll send you a fun blog post I wrote

1:56:15.060 --> 1:56:17.340
 where I made some cool texture patterns

1:56:17.340 --> 1:56:20.000
 from cellular automata that I, but.

1:56:20.980 --> 1:56:22.460
 And those are really always compelling

1:56:22.460 --> 1:56:24.140
 is like you create simple rules

1:56:24.140 --> 1:56:25.820
 and they create some beautiful textures.

1:56:25.820 --> 1:56:26.660
 It doesn't make any sense.

1:56:26.660 --> 1:56:28.020
 Actually, did you see, there was a great paper.

1:56:28.020 --> 1:56:28.980
 I don't know if you saw this,

1:56:28.980 --> 1:56:30.640
 like a machine learning paper.

1:56:30.640 --> 1:56:31.480
 Yes.

1:56:31.480 --> 1:56:32.300
 I don't know if you saw the one I'm talking about

1:56:32.300 --> 1:56:33.300
 where they were like learning the texture

1:56:33.300 --> 1:56:35.660
 as like let's try to like reverse engineer

1:56:35.660 --> 1:56:37.220
 and like learn a cellular automaton

1:56:37.220 --> 1:56:39.340
 that can reduce texture that looks like this

1:56:39.340 --> 1:56:40.340
 from the images.

1:56:40.340 --> 1:56:41.300
 Very cool.

1:56:41.300 --> 1:56:44.760
 And as you say, the thing you said is I feel the same way

1:56:44.760 --> 1:56:45.980
 when I read machine learning paper

1:56:45.980 --> 1:56:47.660
 is that what's especially interesting

1:56:47.660 --> 1:56:49.540
 is the cases where it doesn't work.

1:56:49.540 --> 1:56:51.260
 Like what does it do when it doesn't do the thing

1:56:51.260 --> 1:56:53.380
 that you tried to train it to do?

1:56:53.380 --> 1:56:54.480
 That's extremely interesting.

1:56:54.480 --> 1:56:56.100
 Yeah, yeah, that was a cool paper.

1:56:56.100 --> 1:56:58.340
 So yeah, so let's start with the game of life.

1:56:58.340 --> 1:57:02.300
 Let's start with, or let's start with John Conway.

1:57:02.300 --> 1:57:03.620
 So Conway.

1:57:03.620 --> 1:57:06.060
 So yeah, so let's start with John Conway again.

1:57:06.060 --> 1:57:08.620
 Just, I don't know, from my outsider's perspective,

1:57:08.620 --> 1:57:11.500
 there's not many mathematicians that stand out

1:57:11.500 --> 1:57:13.800
 throughout the history of the 20th century.

1:57:13.800 --> 1:57:15.100
 And he's one of them.

1:57:15.100 --> 1:57:18.180
 I feel like he's not sufficiently recognized.

1:57:18.180 --> 1:57:20.120
 I think he's pretty recognized.

1:57:20.120 --> 1:57:21.120
 Okay, well.

1:57:21.120 --> 1:57:24.360
 I mean, he was a full professor at Princeton

1:57:24.360 --> 1:57:25.200
 for most of his life.

1:57:25.200 --> 1:57:27.100
 He was sort of certainly at the pinnacle of.

1:57:27.100 --> 1:57:30.180
 Yeah, but I found myself every time I talk about Conway

1:57:30.180 --> 1:57:32.240
 and how excited I am about him,

1:57:33.140 --> 1:57:36.660
 I have to constantly explain to people who he is.

1:57:36.660 --> 1:57:39.540
 And that's always a sad sign to me.

1:57:39.540 --> 1:57:41.540
 But that's probably true for a lot of mathematicians.

1:57:41.540 --> 1:57:42.380
 I was about to say,

1:57:42.380 --> 1:57:44.940
 I feel like you have a very elevated idea of how famous.

1:57:44.940 --> 1:57:46.740
 This is what happens when you grow up in the Soviet Union

1:57:46.740 --> 1:57:49.860
 or you think the mathematicians are like very, very famous.

1:57:49.860 --> 1:57:53.100
 Yeah, but I'm not actually so convinced at a tiny tangent

1:57:53.100 --> 1:57:54.660
 that that shouldn't be so.

1:57:54.660 --> 1:57:57.640
 I mean, there's, it's not obvious to me

1:57:57.640 --> 1:57:59.160
 that that's one of the,

1:57:59.160 --> 1:58:01.540
 like if I were to analyze American society,

1:58:01.540 --> 1:58:05.060
 that perhaps elevating mathematical and scientific thinking

1:58:05.060 --> 1:58:08.740
 to a little bit higher level would benefit the society.

1:58:08.740 --> 1:58:11.300
 Well, both in discovering the beauty of what it is

1:58:11.300 --> 1:58:15.020
 to be human and for actually creating cool technology,

1:58:15.020 --> 1:58:16.240
 better iPhones.

1:58:16.240 --> 1:58:18.140
 But anyway, John Conway.

1:58:18.140 --> 1:58:20.000
 Yeah, and Conway is such a perfect example

1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:22.060
 of somebody whose humanity was,

1:58:22.060 --> 1:58:24.020
 and his personality was like wound up

1:58:24.020 --> 1:58:25.020
 with his mathematics, right?

1:58:25.020 --> 1:58:26.780
 And so it's not, sometimes I think people

1:58:26.780 --> 1:58:28.620
 who are outside the field think of mathematics

1:58:28.620 --> 1:58:31.220
 as this kind of like cold thing that you do

1:58:31.220 --> 1:58:33.100
 separate from your existence as a human being.

1:58:33.100 --> 1:58:34.780
 No way, your personality is in there,

1:58:34.780 --> 1:58:37.140
 just as it would be in like a novel you wrote

1:58:37.140 --> 1:58:38.220
 or a painting you painted

1:58:38.220 --> 1:58:40.100
 or just like the way you walk down the street.

1:58:40.100 --> 1:58:41.780
 Like it's in there, it's you doing it.

1:58:41.780 --> 1:58:44.580
 And Conway was certainly a singular personality.

1:58:46.240 --> 1:58:50.980
 I think anybody would say that he was playful,

1:58:50.980 --> 1:58:54.240
 like everything was a game to him.

1:58:54.240 --> 1:58:56.580
 Now, what you might think I'm gonna say,

1:58:56.580 --> 1:58:59.260
 and it's true is that he sort of was very playful

1:58:59.260 --> 1:59:01.780
 in his way of doing mathematics,

1:59:01.780 --> 1:59:03.700
 but it's also true, it went both ways.

1:59:03.700 --> 1:59:06.220
 He also sort of made mathematics out of games.

1:59:06.220 --> 1:59:08.880
 He like looked at, he was a constant inventor of games

1:59:08.880 --> 1:59:10.080
 or like crazy names.

1:59:10.080 --> 1:59:14.060
 And then he would sort of analyze those games mathematically

1:59:15.220 --> 1:59:16.300
 to the point that he,

1:59:16.300 --> 1:59:19.120
 and then later collaborating with Knuth like,

1:59:19.120 --> 1:59:22.420
 created this number system, the serial numbers

1:59:22.420 --> 1:59:25.200
 in which actually each number is a game.

1:59:25.200 --> 1:59:26.640
 There's a wonderful book about this called,

1:59:26.640 --> 1:59:27.620
 I mean, there are his own books.

1:59:27.620 --> 1:59:28.780
 And then there's like a book that he wrote

1:59:28.780 --> 1:59:31.180
 with Berlekamp and Guy called Winning Ways,

1:59:31.180 --> 1:59:35.260
 which is such a rich source of ideas.

1:59:35.260 --> 1:59:40.260
 And he too kind of has his own crazy number system

1:59:41.720 --> 1:59:44.240
 in which by the way, there are these infinitesimals,

1:59:44.240 --> 1:59:45.640
 the ghosts of departed quantities.

1:59:45.640 --> 1:59:47.900
 They're in there now, not as ghosts,

1:59:47.900 --> 1:59:50.200
 but as like certain kind of two player games.

1:59:53.620 --> 1:59:58.620
 So, he was a guy, so I knew him when I was a postdoc

2:00:00.280 --> 2:00:01.280
 and I knew him at Princeton

2:00:01.280 --> 2:00:03.620
 and our research overlapped in some ways.

2:00:03.620 --> 2:00:05.880
 Now it was on stuff that he had worked on many years before.

2:00:05.880 --> 2:00:07.400
 The stuff I was working on kind of connected

2:00:07.400 --> 2:00:08.280
 with stuff in group theory,

2:00:08.280 --> 2:00:10.420
 which somehow seems to keep coming up.

2:00:13.880 --> 2:00:16.040
 And so I often would like sort of ask him a question.

2:00:16.040 --> 2:00:17.680
 I would sort of come upon him in the common room

2:00:17.680 --> 2:00:19.080
 and I would ask him a question about something.

2:00:19.080 --> 2:00:23.780
 And just anytime you turned him on, you know what I mean?

2:00:23.780 --> 2:00:25.240
 You sort of asked the question,

2:00:25.240 --> 2:00:28.280
 it was just like turning a knob and winding him up

2:00:28.280 --> 2:00:31.040
 and he would just go and you would get a response

2:00:31.040 --> 2:00:35.240
 that was like so rich and went so many places

2:00:35.240 --> 2:00:37.360
 and taught you so much.

2:00:37.360 --> 2:00:40.160
 And usually had nothing to do with your question.

2:00:40.160 --> 2:00:43.080
 Usually your question was just a prompt to him.

2:00:43.080 --> 2:00:44.760
 You couldn't count on actually getting the question answered.

2:00:44.760 --> 2:00:47.400
 Yeah, those brilliant, curious minds even at that age.

2:00:47.400 --> 2:00:50.340
 Yeah, it was definitely a huge loss.

2:00:51.920 --> 2:00:54.680
 But on his game of life,

2:00:54.680 --> 2:00:56.960
 which was I think he developed in the 70s

2:00:56.960 --> 2:00:59.720
 as almost like a side thing, a fun little experiment.

2:00:59.720 --> 2:01:04.720
 His game of life is this, it's a very simple algorithm.

2:01:05.200 --> 2:01:07.800
 It's not really a game per se

2:01:07.800 --> 2:01:09.520
 in the sense of the kinds of games that he liked

2:01:09.520 --> 2:01:11.560
 where people played against each other.

2:01:12.780 --> 2:01:16.560
 But essentially it's a game that you play

2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:20.400
 with marking little squares on the sheet of graph paper.

2:01:20.400 --> 2:01:22.360
 And in the 70s, I think he was like literally doing it

2:01:22.360 --> 2:01:24.240
 with like a pen on graph paper.

2:01:24.240 --> 2:01:26.040
 You have some configuration of squares.

2:01:26.040 --> 2:01:28.280
 Some of the squares in the graph paper are filled in,

2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:29.120
 some are not.

2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:32.360
 And there's a rule, a single rule that tells you

2:01:33.360 --> 2:01:36.480
 at the next stage, which squares are filled in

2:01:36.480 --> 2:01:38.120
 and which squares are not.

2:01:38.120 --> 2:01:39.720
 Sometimes an empty square gets filled in,

2:01:39.720 --> 2:01:40.560
 that's called birth.

2:01:40.560 --> 2:01:43.000
 Sometimes a square that's filled in gets erased,

2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:43.960
 that's called death.

2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:45.880
 And there's rules for which squares are born

2:01:45.880 --> 2:01:47.100
 and which squares die.

2:01:50.960 --> 2:01:51.920
 The rule is very simple.

2:01:51.920 --> 2:01:53.640
 You can write it on one line.

2:01:53.640 --> 2:01:56.240
 And then the great miracle is that you can start

2:01:56.240 --> 2:02:00.320
 from some very innocent looking little small set of boxes

2:02:00.320 --> 2:02:04.160
 and get these results of incredible richness.

2:02:04.160 --> 2:02:05.680
 And of course, nowadays you don't do it on paper.

2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:07.000
 Nowadays you do it in a computer.

2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:09.320
 There's actually a great iPad app called Golly,

2:02:09.320 --> 2:02:12.800
 which I really like that has like Conway's original rule

2:02:12.800 --> 2:02:15.600
 and like, gosh, like hundreds of other variants

2:02:15.600 --> 2:02:16.820
 and it's a lightning fast.

2:02:16.820 --> 2:02:17.660
 So you can just be like,

2:02:17.660 --> 2:02:21.400
 I wanna see 10,000 generations of this rule play out

2:02:21.400 --> 2:02:23.000
 like faster than your eye can even follow.

2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:24.040
 And it's like amazing.

2:02:24.040 --> 2:02:26.360
 So I highly recommend it if this is at all intriguing to you

2:02:26.360 --> 2:02:29.400
 getting Golly on your iOS device.

2:02:29.400 --> 2:02:30.740
 And you can do this kind of process,

2:02:30.740 --> 2:02:32.080
 which I really enjoy doing,

2:02:32.080 --> 2:02:35.080
 which is almost from like putting a Darwin hat on

2:02:35.080 --> 2:02:38.600
 or a biologist hat on and doing analysis

2:02:38.600 --> 2:02:41.500
 of a higher level of abstraction,

2:02:41.500 --> 2:02:43.520
 like the organisms that spring up.

2:02:43.520 --> 2:02:45.160
 Cause there's different kinds of organisms.

2:02:45.160 --> 2:02:46.880
 Like you can think of them as species

2:02:46.880 --> 2:02:48.640
 and they interact with each other.

2:02:48.640 --> 2:02:51.040
 They can, there's gliders, they shoot different,

2:02:51.040 --> 2:02:54.320
 there's like things that can travel around.

2:02:54.320 --> 2:02:55.920
 There's things that can,

2:02:55.920 --> 2:02:58.520
 glider guns that can generate those gliders.

2:02:59.520 --> 2:03:01.800
 You can use the same kind of language

2:03:01.800 --> 2:03:04.600
 as you would about describing a biological system.

2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:06.240
 So it's a wonderful laboratory

2:03:06.240 --> 2:03:07.920
 and it's kind of a rebuke to someone

2:03:07.920 --> 2:03:10.960
 who doesn't think that like very, very rich,

2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:15.960
 complex structure can come from very simple underlying laws.

2:03:16.440 --> 2:03:18.880
 Like it definitely can.

2:03:18.880 --> 2:03:20.600
 Now, here's what's interesting.

2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:23.640
 If you just pick like some random rule,

2:03:24.640 --> 2:03:26.200
 you wouldn't get interesting complexity.

2:03:26.200 --> 2:03:28.360
 I think that's one of the most interesting things

2:03:28.360 --> 2:03:31.440
 of these, one of these most interesting features

2:03:31.440 --> 2:03:32.280
 of this whole subject,

2:03:32.280 --> 2:03:34.100
 that the rules have to be tuned just right.

2:03:34.100 --> 2:03:36.060
 Like a sort of typical rule set

2:03:36.060 --> 2:03:38.760
 doesn't generate any kind of interesting behavior.

2:03:38.760 --> 2:03:40.660
 But some do.

2:03:40.660 --> 2:03:44.560
 And I don't think we have a clear way of understanding

2:03:44.560 --> 2:03:45.400
 which do and which don't.

2:03:45.400 --> 2:03:47.320
 Maybe Steven thinks he does, I don't know.

2:03:47.320 --> 2:03:51.820
 No, no, it's a giant mystery where Steven Wolfram did is,

2:03:53.960 --> 2:03:56.000
 now there's a whole interesting aspect to the fact

2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:57.640
 that he's a little bit of an outcast

2:03:57.640 --> 2:03:59.920
 in the mathematics and physics community

2:03:59.920 --> 2:04:02.640
 because he's so focused on a particular,

2:04:02.640 --> 2:04:03.960
 his particular work.

2:04:03.960 --> 2:04:05.800
 I think if you put ego aside,

2:04:05.800 --> 2:04:08.640
 which I think unfairly some people

2:04:08.640 --> 2:04:09.940
 are not able to look beyond,

2:04:09.940 --> 2:04:11.880
 I think his work is actually quite brilliant.

2:04:11.880 --> 2:04:13.840
 But what he did is exactly this process

2:04:13.840 --> 2:04:15.920
 of Darwin like exploration.

2:04:15.920 --> 2:04:17.400
 He's taking these very simple ideas

2:04:17.400 --> 2:04:19.880
 and writing a thousand page book on them,

2:04:19.880 --> 2:04:22.280
 meaning like, let's play around with this thing.

2:04:22.280 --> 2:04:23.480
 Let's see.

2:04:23.480 --> 2:04:25.480
 And can we figure anything out?

2:04:25.480 --> 2:04:27.320
 Spoiler alert, no, we can't.

2:04:28.400 --> 2:04:31.040
 In fact, he does a challenge.

2:04:31.040 --> 2:04:33.240
 I think it's like rule 30 challenge,

2:04:33.240 --> 2:04:34.160
 which is quite interesting,

2:04:34.160 --> 2:04:36.400
 just simply for machine learning people,

2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:39.420
 for mathematics people,

2:04:39.420 --> 2:04:41.800
 is can you predict the middle column?

2:04:41.800 --> 2:04:45.980
 For his, it's a 1D cellular automata.

2:04:45.980 --> 2:04:48.240
 Can you, generally speaking,

2:04:48.240 --> 2:04:50.280
 can you predict anything about

2:04:50.280 --> 2:04:54.380
 how a particular rule will evolve just in the future?

2:04:55.480 --> 2:04:56.320
 Very simple.

2:04:56.320 --> 2:04:59.040
 Just looking at one particular part of the world,

2:04:59.040 --> 2:05:00.560
 just zooming in on that part,

2:05:02.040 --> 2:05:04.720
 100 steps ahead, can you predict something?

2:05:04.720 --> 2:05:08.800
 And the challenge is to do that kind of prediction

2:05:08.800 --> 2:05:10.340
 so far as nobody's come up with an answer.

2:05:10.340 --> 2:05:13.520
 But the point is like, we can't.

2:05:13.520 --> 2:05:16.880
 We don't have tools or maybe it's impossible or,

2:05:16.880 --> 2:05:19.960
 I mean, he has these kind of laws of irreducibility

2:05:19.960 --> 2:05:21.520
 that he refers to, but it's poetry.

2:05:21.520 --> 2:05:22.880
 It's like, we can't prove these things.

2:05:22.880 --> 2:05:24.420
 It seems like we can't.

2:05:24.420 --> 2:05:25.260
 That's the basic.

2:05:26.280 --> 2:05:28.520
 It almost sounds like ancient mathematics

2:05:28.520 --> 2:05:30.060
 or something like that, where you're like,

2:05:30.060 --> 2:05:34.320
 the gods will not allow us to predict the cellular automata.

2:05:34.320 --> 2:05:37.840
 But that's fascinating that we can't.

2:05:37.840 --> 2:05:39.120
 I'm not sure what to make of it.

2:05:39.120 --> 2:05:43.000
 And there's power to calling this particular set of rules

2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:47.880
 game of life as Conway did, because not exactly sure,

2:05:47.880 --> 2:05:51.480
 but I think he had a sense that there's some core ideas here

2:05:51.480 --> 2:05:55.800
 that are fundamental to life, to complex systems,

2:05:55.800 --> 2:05:57.520
 to the way life emerge on earth.

2:05:59.320 --> 2:06:01.720
 I'm not sure I think Conway thought that.

2:06:01.720 --> 2:06:03.200
 It's something that, I mean, Conway always had

2:06:03.200 --> 2:06:05.880
 a rather ambivalent relationship with the game of life

2:06:05.880 --> 2:06:09.960
 because I think he saw it as,

2:06:11.120 --> 2:06:12.960
 it was certainly the thing he was most famous for

2:06:12.960 --> 2:06:14.680
 in the outside world.

2:06:14.680 --> 2:06:18.640
 And I think that he, his view, which is correct,

2:06:18.640 --> 2:06:19.600
 is that he had done things

2:06:19.600 --> 2:06:22.120
 that were much deeper mathematically than that.

2:06:22.120 --> 2:06:24.260
 And I think it always aggrieved him a bit

2:06:24.260 --> 2:06:26.200
 that he was the game of life guy

2:06:26.200 --> 2:06:28.640
 when he proved all these wonderful theorems

2:06:28.640 --> 2:06:32.080
 and created all these wonderful games,

2:06:32.080 --> 2:06:33.360
 created the serial numbers.

2:06:33.360 --> 2:06:36.520
 I mean, he was a very tireless guy

2:06:36.520 --> 2:06:40.800
 who just did an incredibly variegated array of stuff.

2:06:40.800 --> 2:06:42.480
 So he was exactly the kind of person

2:06:42.480 --> 2:06:45.600
 who you would never want to reduce to one achievement.

2:06:45.600 --> 2:06:46.920
 You know what I mean?

2:06:46.920 --> 2:06:50.400
 Let me ask you about group theory.

2:06:50.400 --> 2:06:51.800
 You mentioned it a few times.

2:06:51.800 --> 2:06:53.440
 What is group theory?

2:06:53.440 --> 2:06:57.420
 What is an idea from group theory that you find beautiful?

2:06:58.600 --> 2:07:01.960
 Well, so I would say group theory sort of starts

2:07:01.960 --> 2:07:04.660
 as the general theory of symmetries,

2:07:04.660 --> 2:07:08.280
 that people looked at different kinds of things

2:07:08.280 --> 2:07:12.960
 and said, as we said, oh, it could have,

2:07:12.960 --> 2:07:16.440
 maybe all there is is symmetry from left to right,

2:07:16.440 --> 2:07:17.760
 like a human being, right?

2:07:17.760 --> 2:07:21.320
 That's roughly bilaterally symmetric, as we say.

2:07:21.320 --> 2:07:23.840
 So there's two symmetries.

2:07:23.840 --> 2:07:24.920
 And then you're like, well, wait, didn't I say

2:07:24.920 --> 2:07:26.720
 there's just one, there's just left to right?

2:07:26.720 --> 2:07:30.080
 Well, we always count the symmetry of doing nothing.

2:07:30.080 --> 2:07:31.100
 We always count the symmetry

2:07:31.100 --> 2:07:33.080
 that's like there's flip and don't flip.

2:07:33.080 --> 2:07:35.200
 Those are the two configurations that you can be in.

2:07:35.200 --> 2:07:36.040
 So there's two.

2:07:37.600 --> 2:07:40.240
 You know, something like a rectangle

2:07:40.240 --> 2:07:41.560
 is bilaterally symmetric.

2:07:41.560 --> 2:07:42.600
 You can flip it left to right,

2:07:42.600 --> 2:07:44.560
 but you can also flip it top to bottom.

2:07:45.880 --> 2:07:47.680
 So there's actually four symmetries.

2:07:47.680 --> 2:07:50.320
 There's do nothing, flip it left to right

2:07:50.320 --> 2:07:52.960
 and flip it top to bottom or do both of those things.

2:07:52.960 --> 2:07:57.960
 And then a square, there's even more,

2:07:59.700 --> 2:08:01.700
 because now you can rotate it.

2:08:01.700 --> 2:08:03.060
 You can rotate it by 90 degrees.

2:08:03.060 --> 2:08:03.900
 So you can't do that.

2:08:03.900 --> 2:08:04.940
 That's not a symmetry of the rectangle.

2:08:04.940 --> 2:08:06.180
 If you try to rotate it 90 degrees,

2:08:06.180 --> 2:08:08.880
 you get a rectangle oriented in a different way.

2:08:08.880 --> 2:08:11.880
 So a person has two symmetries,

2:08:11.880 --> 2:08:14.420
 a rectangle four, a square eight,

2:08:14.420 --> 2:08:15.420
 different kinds of shapes

2:08:15.420 --> 2:08:17.520
 have different numbers of symmetries.

2:08:18.860 --> 2:08:19.940
 And the real observation is that

2:08:19.940 --> 2:08:24.940
 that's just not like a set of things, they can be combined.

2:08:25.060 --> 2:08:27.700
 You do one symmetry, then you do another.

2:08:27.700 --> 2:08:31.020
 The result of that is some third symmetry.

2:08:31.020 --> 2:08:34.840
 So a group really abstracts away this notion of saying,

2:08:38.780 --> 2:08:41.180
 it's just some collection of transformations

2:08:41.180 --> 2:08:42.060
 you can do to a thing

2:08:42.060 --> 2:08:44.380
 where you combine any two of them to get a third.

2:08:44.380 --> 2:08:45.620
 So, you know, a place where this comes up

2:08:45.620 --> 2:08:48.260
 in computer science is in sorting,

2:08:48.260 --> 2:08:50.500
 because the ways of permuting a set,

2:08:50.500 --> 2:08:52.340
 the ways of taking sort of some set of things

2:08:52.340 --> 2:08:53.180
 you have on the table

2:08:53.180 --> 2:08:54.260
 and putting them in a different order,

2:08:54.260 --> 2:08:56.100
 shuffling a deck of cards, for instance,

2:08:56.100 --> 2:08:57.580
 those are the symmetries of the deck.

2:08:57.580 --> 2:08:58.420
 And there's a lot of them.

2:08:58.420 --> 2:09:00.140
 There's not two, there's not four, there's not eight.

2:09:00.140 --> 2:09:01.560
 Think about how many different orders

2:09:01.560 --> 2:09:02.620
 the deck of card can be in.

2:09:02.620 --> 2:09:05.980
 Each one of those is the result of applying a symmetry

2:09:06.820 --> 2:09:07.660
 to the original deck.

2:09:07.660 --> 2:09:09.060
 So a shuffle is a symmetry, right?

2:09:09.060 --> 2:09:10.620
 You're reordering the cards.

2:09:10.620 --> 2:09:12.940
 If I shuffle and then you shuffle,

2:09:12.940 --> 2:09:16.020
 the result is some other kind of thing.

2:09:16.020 --> 2:09:17.780
 You might call it a double shuffle,

2:09:17.780 --> 2:09:19.980
 which is a more complicated symmetry.

2:09:19.980 --> 2:09:22.180
 So group theory is kind of the study

2:09:22.180 --> 2:09:24.460
 of the general abstract world

2:09:24.460 --> 2:09:27.020
 that encompasses all these kinds of things.

2:09:27.020 --> 2:09:29.380
 But then of course, like lots of things

2:09:29.380 --> 2:09:31.780
 that are way more complicated than that.

2:09:31.780 --> 2:09:33.540
 Like infinite groups of symmetries, for instance.

2:09:33.540 --> 2:09:35.100
 So they can be infinite, huh?

2:09:35.100 --> 2:09:35.940
 Oh yeah.

2:09:35.940 --> 2:09:36.780
 Okay.

2:09:36.780 --> 2:09:37.620
 Well, okay, ready?

2:09:37.620 --> 2:09:41.180
 Think about the symmetries of the line.

2:09:41.180 --> 2:09:45.020
 You're like, okay, I can reflect it left to right,

2:09:45.020 --> 2:09:46.820
 you know, around the origin.

2:09:46.820 --> 2:09:49.580
 Okay, but I could also reflect it left to right,

2:09:49.580 --> 2:09:52.180
 grabbing somewhere else, like at one or two

2:09:52.180 --> 2:09:54.620
 or pi or anywhere.

2:09:54.620 --> 2:09:56.440
 Or I could just slide it some distance.

2:09:56.440 --> 2:09:57.340
 That's a symmetry.

2:09:57.340 --> 2:09:58.540
 Slide it five units over.

2:09:58.540 --> 2:10:01.220
 So there's clearly infinitely many symmetries of the line.

2:10:01.220 --> 2:10:03.500
 That's an example of an infinite group of symmetries.

2:10:03.500 --> 2:10:06.940
 Is it possible to say something that kind of captivates,

2:10:06.940 --> 2:10:09.420
 keeps being brought up by physicists,

2:10:09.420 --> 2:10:11.760
 which is gauge theory, gauge symmetry,

2:10:12.640 --> 2:10:14.900
 as one of the more complicated type of symmetries?

2:10:14.900 --> 2:10:18.380
 Is there an easy explanation of what the heck it is?

2:10:18.380 --> 2:10:21.860
 Is that something that comes up on your mind at all?

2:10:21.860 --> 2:10:23.380
 Well, I'm not a mathematical physicist,

2:10:23.380 --> 2:10:24.380
 but I can say this.

2:10:24.380 --> 2:10:29.380
 It is certainly true that it has been a very useful notion

2:10:29.460 --> 2:10:31.860
 in physics to try to say like,

2:10:31.860 --> 2:10:34.580
 what are the symmetry groups of the world?

2:10:34.580 --> 2:10:35.660
 Like what are the symmetries

2:10:35.660 --> 2:10:36.980
 under which things don't change, right?

2:10:36.980 --> 2:10:39.220
 So we just, I think we talked a little bit earlier

2:10:39.220 --> 2:10:40.700
 about it should be a basic principle

2:10:40.700 --> 2:10:44.180
 that a theorem that's true here is also true over there.

2:10:44.180 --> 2:10:45.700
 And same for a physical law, right?

2:10:45.700 --> 2:10:47.660
 I mean, if gravity is like this over here,

2:10:47.660 --> 2:10:49.140
 it should also be like this over there.

2:10:49.140 --> 2:10:52.660
 Okay, what that's saying is we think translation in space

2:10:52.660 --> 2:10:54.020
 should be a symmetry.

2:10:54.020 --> 2:10:56.540
 All the laws of physics should be unchanged

2:10:56.540 --> 2:10:57.860
 if the symmetry we have in mind

2:10:57.860 --> 2:10:59.700
 is a very simple one like translation.

2:10:59.700 --> 2:11:03.820
 And so then there becomes a question,

2:11:03.820 --> 2:11:07.980
 like what are the symmetries of the actual world

2:11:07.980 --> 2:11:09.820
 with its physical laws?

2:11:09.820 --> 2:11:12.900
 And one way of thinking, this isn't oversimplification,

2:11:12.900 --> 2:11:16.220
 but like one way of thinking of this big shift

2:11:18.420 --> 2:11:22.420
 from before Einstein to after

2:11:22.420 --> 2:11:25.300
 is that we just changed our idea

2:11:25.300 --> 2:11:29.780
 about what the fundamental group of symmetries were.

2:11:29.780 --> 2:11:31.820
 So that things like the Lorenz contraction,

2:11:31.820 --> 2:11:34.340
 things like these bizarre relativistic phenomenon

2:11:34.340 --> 2:11:37.700
 or Lorenz would have said, oh, to make this work,

2:11:37.700 --> 2:11:42.700
 we need a thing to change its shape

2:11:44.580 --> 2:11:47.460
 if it's moving nearly the speed of light.

2:11:47.460 --> 2:11:50.260
 Well, under the new framework, it's much better.

2:11:50.260 --> 2:11:51.700
 You say, oh, no, it wasn't changing its shape.

2:11:51.700 --> 2:11:54.420
 You were just wrong about what counted as a symmetry.

2:11:54.420 --> 2:11:55.420
 Now that we have this new group,

2:11:55.420 --> 2:11:57.380
 the so called Lorenz group,

2:11:57.380 --> 2:11:59.220
 now that we understand what the symmetries really are,

2:11:59.220 --> 2:12:00.340
 we see it was just an illusion

2:12:00.340 --> 2:12:02.940
 that the thing was changing its shape.

2:12:02.940 --> 2:12:05.780
 Yeah, so you can then describe the sameness of things

2:12:05.780 --> 2:12:08.820
 under this weirdness that is general relativity,

2:12:08.820 --> 2:12:09.660
 for example.

2:12:10.940 --> 2:12:15.940
 Yeah, yeah, still, I wish there was a simpler explanation

2:12:16.020 --> 2:12:19.820
 of like exact, I mean, gauge symmetries,

2:12:19.820 --> 2:12:24.340
 pretty simple general concept about rulers being deformed.

2:12:26.260 --> 2:12:31.260
 I've actually just personally been on a search,

2:12:31.500 --> 2:12:34.740
 not a very rigorous or aggressive search,

2:12:34.740 --> 2:12:37.980
 but for something I personally enjoy,

2:12:37.980 --> 2:12:40.980
 which is taking complicated concepts

2:12:40.980 --> 2:12:44.780
 and finding the sort of minimal example

2:12:44.780 --> 2:12:47.580
 that I can play around with, especially programmatically.

2:12:47.580 --> 2:12:48.420
 That's great, I mean,

2:12:48.420 --> 2:12:50.220
 this is what we try to train our students to do, right?

2:12:50.220 --> 2:12:52.620
 I mean, in class, this is exactly what,

2:12:52.620 --> 2:12:54.620
 this is like best pedagogical practice.

2:12:54.620 --> 2:12:57.380
 I do hope there's simple explanation,

2:12:57.380 --> 2:13:02.380
 especially like I've in my sort of drunk random walk,

2:13:02.380 --> 2:13:04.580
 drunk walk, whatever that's called,

2:13:04.580 --> 2:13:07.580
 sometimes stumble into the world of topology

2:13:08.580 --> 2:13:11.420
 and like quickly, like, you know when you go into a party

2:13:11.420 --> 2:13:14.260
 and you realize this is not the right party for me?

2:13:14.260 --> 2:13:16.900
 It's, so whenever I go into topology,

2:13:16.900 --> 2:13:20.420
 it's like so much math everywhere.

2:13:20.420 --> 2:13:23.100
 I don't even know what, it feels like this is me

2:13:23.100 --> 2:13:25.900
 like being a hater, I think there's way too much math.

2:13:25.900 --> 2:13:29.220
 Like there are two, the cool kids who just want to have,

2:13:29.220 --> 2:13:31.060
 like everything is expressed through math.

2:13:31.060 --> 2:13:33.100
 Because they're actually afraid to express stuff

2:13:33.100 --> 2:13:34.860
 simply through language.

2:13:34.860 --> 2:13:37.580
 That's my hater formulation of topology.

2:13:37.580 --> 2:13:39.620
 But at the same time, I'm sure that's very necessary

2:13:39.620 --> 2:13:41.300
 to do sort of rigorous discussion.

2:13:41.300 --> 2:13:42.620
 But I feel like.

2:13:42.620 --> 2:13:44.300
 But don't you think that's what gauge symmetry is like?

2:13:44.300 --> 2:13:45.420
 I mean, it's not a field I know well,

2:13:45.420 --> 2:13:46.500
 but it certainly seems like.

2:13:46.500 --> 2:13:47.820
 Yes, it is like that.

2:13:47.820 --> 2:13:50.620
 But my problem with topology, okay,

2:13:50.620 --> 2:13:55.140
 and even like differential geometry is like,

2:13:55.140 --> 2:13:59.060
 you're talking about beautiful things.

2:13:59.060 --> 2:14:02.060
 Like if they could be visualized, it's open question

2:14:02.060 --> 2:14:03.900
 if everything could be visualized,

2:14:03.900 --> 2:14:05.020
 but you're talking about things

2:14:05.020 --> 2:14:08.100
 that can be visually stunning, I think.

2:14:09.180 --> 2:14:12.620
 But they are hidden underneath all of that math.

2:14:13.900 --> 2:14:16.380
 Like if you look at the papers that are written

2:14:16.380 --> 2:14:18.580
 in topology, if you look at all the discussions

2:14:18.580 --> 2:14:22.140
 on Stack Exchange, they're all math dense, math heavy.

2:14:22.140 --> 2:14:25.420
 And the only kind of visual things

2:14:25.420 --> 2:14:27.540
 that emerge every once in a while,

2:14:27.540 --> 2:14:30.980
 is like something like a Mobius strip.

2:14:30.980 --> 2:14:33.980
 Every once in a while, some kind of simple visualizations.

2:14:33.980 --> 2:14:36.980
 Every once in a while, some kind of simple visualizations.

2:14:36.980 --> 2:14:37.460
 Every once in a while, some kind of simple visualizations.

2:14:37.460 --> 2:14:40.260
 Well, there's the vibration, there's the hop vibration

2:14:40.260 --> 2:14:42.500
 or all those kinds of things that somebody,

2:14:42.500 --> 2:14:45.180
 some grad student from like 20 years ago

2:14:45.180 --> 2:14:48.500
 wrote a program in Fortran to visualize it, and that's it.

2:14:48.500 --> 2:14:51.060
 And it's just, you know, it's makes me sad

2:14:51.060 --> 2:14:53.460
 because those are visual disciplines.

2:14:53.460 --> 2:14:56.460
 Just like computer vision is a visual discipline.

2:14:56.460 --> 2:14:59.700
 So you can provide a lot of visual examples.

2:14:59.700 --> 2:15:03.380
 I wish topology was more excited

2:15:03.380 --> 2:15:07.220
 and in love with visualizing some of the ideas.

2:15:07.220 --> 2:15:09.060
 I mean, you could say that, but I would say for me,

2:15:09.060 --> 2:15:11.940
 a picture of the hop vibration does nothing for me.

2:15:11.940 --> 2:15:13.540
 Whereas like when you're like, oh,

2:15:13.540 --> 2:15:14.740
 it's like about the quaternions.

2:15:14.740 --> 2:15:16.100
 It's like a subgroup of the quaternions.

2:15:16.100 --> 2:15:17.860
 And I'm like, oh, so now I see what's going on.

2:15:17.860 --> 2:15:18.900
 Like, why didn't you just say that?

2:15:18.900 --> 2:15:20.580
 Why were you like showing me this stupid picture

2:15:20.580 --> 2:15:22.460
 instead of telling me what you were talking about?

2:15:22.460 --> 2:15:25.020
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

2:15:25.020 --> 2:15:26.460
 I'm just saying, no, but it goes back

2:15:26.460 --> 2:15:27.380
 to what you were saying about teaching

2:15:27.380 --> 2:15:29.780
 that like people are different in what they'll respond to.

2:15:29.780 --> 2:15:32.100
 So I think there's no, I mean, I'm very opposed

2:15:32.100 --> 2:15:34.420
 to the idea that there's a one right way to explain things.

2:15:34.420 --> 2:15:37.260
 I think there's like a huge variation in like, you know,

2:15:37.260 --> 2:15:40.300
 our brains like have all these like weird like hooks

2:15:40.300 --> 2:15:42.100
 and loops and it's like very hard to know

2:15:42.100 --> 2:15:43.300
 like what's gonna latch on

2:15:43.300 --> 2:15:46.140
 and it's not gonna be the same thing for everybody.

2:15:46.140 --> 2:15:49.500
 So I think monoculture is bad, right?

2:15:49.500 --> 2:15:51.580
 I think that's, and I think we're agreeing on that point

2:15:51.580 --> 2:15:53.740
 that like, it's good that there's like a lot

2:15:53.740 --> 2:15:55.540
 of different ways in and a lot of different ways

2:15:55.540 --> 2:15:57.500
 to describe these ideas because different people

2:15:57.500 --> 2:15:59.780
 are gonna find different things illuminating.

2:15:59.780 --> 2:16:04.460
 But that said, I think there's a lot to be discovered

2:16:04.460 --> 2:16:09.460
 when you force little like silos of brilliant people

2:16:11.060 --> 2:16:15.300
 to kind of find a middle ground

2:16:15.300 --> 2:16:20.260
 or like aggregate or come together in a way.

2:16:20.260 --> 2:16:23.580
 So there's like people that do love visual things.

2:16:23.580 --> 2:16:25.740
 I mean, there's a lot of disciplines,

2:16:25.740 --> 2:16:27.020
 especially in computer science

2:16:27.020 --> 2:16:28.900
 that they're obsessed with visualizing,

2:16:28.900 --> 2:16:31.500
 visualizing data, visualizing neural networks.

2:16:31.500 --> 2:16:34.100
 I mean, neural networks themselves are fundamentally visual.

2:16:34.100 --> 2:16:36.700
 There's a lot of work in computer vision that's very visual.

2:16:36.700 --> 2:16:39.140
 And then coming together with some folks

2:16:39.140 --> 2:16:41.020
 that were like deeply rigorous

2:16:41.020 --> 2:16:43.620
 and are like totally lost in multi dimensional space

2:16:43.620 --> 2:16:46.220
 where it's hard to even bring them back down to 3D.

2:16:48.220 --> 2:16:50.300
 They're very comfortable in this multi dimensional space.

2:16:50.300 --> 2:16:53.500
 So forcing them to kind of work together to communicate

2:16:53.500 --> 2:16:57.300
 because it's not just about public communication of ideas.

2:16:57.300 --> 2:16:59.180
 It's also, I feel like when you're forced

2:16:59.180 --> 2:17:02.100
 to do that public communication like you did with your book,

2:17:02.100 --> 2:17:05.780
 I think deep profound ideas can be discovered

2:17:05.780 --> 2:17:08.740
 that's like applicable for research and for science.

2:17:08.740 --> 2:17:10.780
 Like there's something about that simplification

2:17:10.780 --> 2:17:15.380
 or not simplification, but distillation or condensation

2:17:15.380 --> 2:17:17.020
 or whatever the hell you call it,

2:17:17.020 --> 2:17:19.860
 compression of ideas that somehow

2:17:19.860 --> 2:17:22.140
 actually stimulates creativity.

2:17:22.140 --> 2:17:25.220
 And I'd be excited to see more of that

2:17:25.220 --> 2:17:27.820
 in the mathematics community.

2:17:27.820 --> 2:17:28.660
 Can you?

2:17:28.660 --> 2:17:29.500
 Let me make a crazy metaphor.

2:17:29.500 --> 2:17:31.140
 Maybe it's a little bit like the relation

2:17:31.140 --> 2:17:32.620
 between prose and poetry, right?

2:17:32.620 --> 2:17:33.740
 I mean, if you, you might say like,

2:17:33.740 --> 2:17:35.020
 why do we need anything more than prose?

2:17:35.020 --> 2:17:36.460
 You're trying to convey some information.

2:17:36.460 --> 2:17:38.500
 So you just like say it.

2:17:38.500 --> 2:17:40.500
 Well, poetry does something, right?

2:17:40.500 --> 2:17:43.340
 It's sort of, you might think of it as a kind of compression.

2:17:43.340 --> 2:17:44.940
 Of course, not all poetry is compressed.

2:17:44.940 --> 2:17:47.660
 Like not all, some of it is quite baggy,

2:17:47.660 --> 2:17:52.660
 but like you are kind of, often it's compressed, right?

2:17:53.340 --> 2:17:55.620
 A lyric poem is often sort of like a compression

2:17:55.620 --> 2:17:57.740
 of what would take a long time

2:17:57.740 --> 2:18:00.300
 and be complicated to explain in prose

2:18:00.300 --> 2:18:03.300
 into sort of a different mode

2:18:03.300 --> 2:18:05.380
 that is gonna hit in a different way.

2:18:05.380 --> 2:18:08.980
 We talked about Poincare conjecture.

2:18:10.180 --> 2:18:14.620
 There's a guy, he's Russian, Grigori Perlman.

2:18:14.620 --> 2:18:16.620
 He proved Poincare's conjecture.

2:18:16.620 --> 2:18:19.220
 If you can comment on the proof itself,

2:18:19.220 --> 2:18:21.580
 if that stands out to you as something interesting

2:18:21.580 --> 2:18:23.220
 or the human story of it,

2:18:23.220 --> 2:18:27.020
 which is he turned down the field's metal for the proof.

2:18:28.380 --> 2:18:32.780
 Is there something you find inspiring or insightful

2:18:32.780 --> 2:18:36.180
 about the proof itself or about the man?

2:18:36.180 --> 2:18:40.620
 Yeah, I mean, one thing I really like about the proof

2:18:40.620 --> 2:18:42.940
 and partly that's because it's sort of a thing

2:18:42.940 --> 2:18:45.140
 that happens again and again in this book.

2:18:45.140 --> 2:18:46.940
 I mean, I'm writing about geometry and the way

2:18:46.940 --> 2:18:50.220
 it sort of appears in all these kind of real world problems.

2:18:50.220 --> 2:18:52.780
 But it happens so often that the geometry

2:18:52.780 --> 2:18:56.940
 you think you're studying is somehow not enough.

2:18:56.940 --> 2:18:59.260
 You have to go one level higher in abstraction

2:18:59.260 --> 2:19:01.660
 and study a higher level of geometry.

2:19:01.660 --> 2:19:05.380
 And the way that plays out is that Poincare asks a question

2:19:05.380 --> 2:19:07.900
 about a certain kind of three dimensional object.

2:19:07.900 --> 2:19:10.340
 Is it the usual three dimensional space that we know

2:19:10.340 --> 2:19:13.100
 or is it some kind of exotic thing?

2:19:13.100 --> 2:19:15.140
 And so, of course, this sounds like it's a question

2:19:15.140 --> 2:19:17.660
 about the geometry of the three dimensional space,

2:19:17.660 --> 2:19:20.260
 but no, Perelman understands.

2:19:20.260 --> 2:19:21.980
 And by the way, in a tradition that involves

2:19:21.980 --> 2:19:23.580
 Richard Hamilton and many other people,

2:19:23.580 --> 2:19:26.360
 like most really important mathematical advances,

2:19:26.360 --> 2:19:27.460
 this doesn't happen alone.

2:19:27.460 --> 2:19:28.540
 It doesn't happen in a vacuum.

2:19:28.540 --> 2:19:30.220
 It happens as the culmination of a program

2:19:30.220 --> 2:19:31.340
 that involves many people.

2:19:31.340 --> 2:19:32.460
 Same with Wiles, by the way.

2:19:32.460 --> 2:19:34.400
 I mean, we talked about Wiles and I wanna emphasize

2:19:34.400 --> 2:19:36.700
 that starting all the way back with Kummer,

2:19:36.700 --> 2:19:38.220
 who I mentioned in the 19th century,

2:19:38.220 --> 2:19:42.260
 but Gerhard Frey and Mazer and Ken Ribbit

2:19:42.260 --> 2:19:45.260
 and like many other people are involved

2:19:45.260 --> 2:19:47.260
 in building the other pieces of the arch

2:19:47.260 --> 2:19:48.340
 before you put the keystone in.

2:19:48.340 --> 2:19:50.380
 We stand on the shoulders of giants.

2:19:50.380 --> 2:19:51.220
 Yes.

2:19:53.900 --> 2:19:56.100
 So, what is this idea?

2:19:56.100 --> 2:19:57.460
 The idea is that, well, of course,

2:19:57.460 --> 2:19:59.940
 the geometry of the three dimensional object itself

2:19:59.940 --> 2:20:02.500
 is relevant, but the real geometry you have to understand

2:20:02.500 --> 2:20:04.740
 is the geometry of the space

2:20:04.740 --> 2:20:07.420
 of all three dimensional geometries.

2:20:07.420 --> 2:20:10.540
 Whoa, you're going up a higher level.

2:20:10.540 --> 2:20:12.040
 Because when you do that, you can say,

2:20:12.040 --> 2:20:17.040
 now let's trace out a path in that space.

2:20:18.260 --> 2:20:19.840
 There's a mechanism called Ricci flow.

2:20:19.840 --> 2:20:21.100
 And again, we're outside my research area.

2:20:21.100 --> 2:20:23.380
 So for all the geometric analysts

2:20:23.380 --> 2:20:25.820
 and differential geometers out there listening to this,

2:20:25.820 --> 2:20:29.500
 if I, please, I'm doing my best and I'm roughly saying it.

2:20:29.500 --> 2:20:32.220
 So the Ricci flow allows you to say like,

2:20:32.220 --> 2:20:35.400
 okay, let's start from some mystery three dimensional space,

2:20:35.400 --> 2:20:37.740
 which Poincare would conjecture is essentially

2:20:37.740 --> 2:20:39.520
 the same thing as our familiar three dimensional space,

2:20:39.520 --> 2:20:41.260
 but we don't know that.

2:20:41.260 --> 2:20:44.180
 And now you let it flow.

2:20:44.180 --> 2:20:47.500
 You sort of like let it move in its natural path

2:20:47.500 --> 2:20:50.140
 according to some almost physical process

2:20:50.140 --> 2:20:51.460
 and ask where it winds up.

2:20:51.460 --> 2:20:54.360
 And what you find is that it always winds up.

2:20:54.360 --> 2:20:55.740
 You've continuously deformed it.

2:20:55.740 --> 2:20:58.340
 There's that word deformation again.

2:20:58.340 --> 2:21:00.180
 And what you can prove is that the process doesn't stop

2:21:00.180 --> 2:21:02.100
 until you get to the usual three dimensional space.

2:21:02.100 --> 2:21:04.660
 And since you can get from the mystery thing

2:21:04.660 --> 2:21:06.840
 to the standard space by this process

2:21:06.840 --> 2:21:09.900
 of continually changing and never kind of

2:21:09.900 --> 2:21:12.980
 having any sharp transitions,

2:21:12.980 --> 2:21:16.300
 then the original shape must've been the same

2:21:16.300 --> 2:21:17.500
 as the standard shape.

2:21:17.500 --> 2:21:18.780
 That's the nature of the proof.

2:21:18.780 --> 2:21:20.460
 Now, of course, it's incredibly technical.

2:21:20.460 --> 2:21:21.500
 I think as I understand it,

2:21:21.500 --> 2:21:23.360
 I think the hard part is proving

2:21:23.360 --> 2:21:25.640
 that the favorite word of AI people,

2:21:25.640 --> 2:21:27.940
 you don't get any singularities along the way.

2:21:29.460 --> 2:21:30.500
 But of course, in this context,

2:21:30.500 --> 2:21:34.360
 singularity just means acquiring a sharp kink.

2:21:34.360 --> 2:21:37.020
 It just means becoming non smooth at some point.

2:21:37.020 --> 2:21:41.020
 So just saying something interesting about formal,

2:21:41.020 --> 2:21:42.740
 about the smooth trajectory

2:21:42.740 --> 2:21:45.380
 through this weird space of geometries.

2:21:45.380 --> 2:21:46.740
 But yeah, so what I like about it

2:21:46.740 --> 2:21:49.620
 is that it's just one of many examples of where

2:21:49.620 --> 2:21:51.680
 it's not about the geometry you think it's about.

2:21:51.680 --> 2:21:55.980
 It's about the geometry of all geometries, so to speak.

2:21:55.980 --> 2:21:59.600
 And it's only by kind of like being jerked out of flatland.

2:21:59.600 --> 2:22:00.440
 Same idea.

2:22:00.440 --> 2:22:04.160
 It's only by sort of seeing the whole thing globally at once

2:22:04.160 --> 2:22:05.860
 that you can really make progress on understanding

2:22:05.860 --> 2:22:08.440
 the one thing you thought you were looking at.

2:22:08.440 --> 2:22:09.520
 It's a romantic question,

2:22:09.520 --> 2:22:11.140
 but what do you think about him

2:22:11.140 --> 2:22:12.980
 turning down the Fields Medal?

2:22:12.980 --> 2:22:17.020
 Is that just, are Nobel Prizes and Fields Medals

2:22:17.020 --> 2:22:19.980
 just the cherry on top of the cake

2:22:19.980 --> 2:22:24.980
 and really math itself, the process of curiosity,

2:22:25.220 --> 2:22:28.500
 of pulling at the string of the mystery before us?

2:22:28.500 --> 2:22:29.580
 That's the cake?

2:22:29.580 --> 2:22:33.780
 And then the awards are just icing

2:22:33.780 --> 2:22:37.220
 and clearly I've been fasting and I'm hungry,

2:22:37.220 --> 2:22:42.220
 but do you think it's tragic or just a little curiosity

2:22:44.620 --> 2:22:46.380
 that he turned down the medal?

2:22:46.380 --> 2:22:48.460
 Well, it's interesting because on the one hand,

2:22:48.460 --> 2:22:50.780
 I think it's absolutely true that right,

2:22:50.780 --> 2:22:55.500
 in some kind of like vast spiritual sense,

2:22:55.500 --> 2:22:57.380
 like awards are not important,

2:22:57.380 --> 2:22:59.260
 like not important the way that sort of like

2:22:59.260 --> 2:23:01.260
 understanding the universe is important.

2:23:01.260 --> 2:23:04.620
 On the other hand, most people who are offered that prize

2:23:04.620 --> 2:23:07.740
 accept it, so there's something unusual

2:23:07.740 --> 2:23:11.740
 about his choice there.

2:23:11.740 --> 2:23:14.420
 I wouldn't say I see it as tragic.

2:23:14.420 --> 2:23:16.220
 I mean, maybe if I don't really feel like

2:23:16.220 --> 2:23:19.260
 I have a clear picture of why he chose not to take it.

2:23:19.260 --> 2:23:22.060
 I mean, he's not alone in doing things like this.

2:23:22.060 --> 2:23:25.300
 People sometimes turn down prizes for ideological reasons,

2:23:26.540 --> 2:23:28.020
 but probably more often in mathematics.

2:23:28.020 --> 2:23:30.020
 I mean, I think I'm right in saying that

2:23:30.020 --> 2:23:33.940
 Peter Schultz turned down sort of some big monetary prize

2:23:33.940 --> 2:23:36.660
 because he just, you know, I mean, I think he,

2:23:36.660 --> 2:23:39.260
 at some point you have plenty of money

2:23:39.260 --> 2:23:41.340
 and maybe you think it sends the wrong message

2:23:41.340 --> 2:23:44.420
 about what the point of doing mathematics is.

2:23:45.740 --> 2:23:47.540
 I do find that there's most people accept.

2:23:47.540 --> 2:23:48.820
 You know, most people give it a prize.

2:23:48.820 --> 2:23:49.660
 Most people take it.

2:23:49.660 --> 2:23:50.900
 I mean, people like to be appreciated,

2:23:50.900 --> 2:23:53.020
 but like I said, we're people.

2:23:53.020 --> 2:23:54.700
 Not that different from most other people.

2:23:54.700 --> 2:23:57.900
 But the important reminder that that turning down

2:23:57.900 --> 2:24:01.500
 a prize serves for me is not that there's anything wrong

2:24:01.500 --> 2:24:03.580
 with the prize and there's something wonderful

2:24:03.580 --> 2:24:04.940
 about the prize, I think.

2:24:04.940 --> 2:24:07.660
 The Nobel prize is trickier

2:24:07.660 --> 2:24:10.340
 because so many Nobel prizes are given.

2:24:10.340 --> 2:24:12.300
 First of all, the Nobel prize often forgets

2:24:12.300 --> 2:24:15.660
 many, many of the important people throughout history.

2:24:15.660 --> 2:24:18.940
 Second of all, there's like these weird rules to it

2:24:18.940 --> 2:24:20.260
 that it's only three people

2:24:20.260 --> 2:24:22.460
 and some projects have a huge number of people.

2:24:22.460 --> 2:24:26.220
 And it's like this, it, I don't know.

2:24:26.220 --> 2:24:31.180
 It doesn't kind of highlight the way science is done

2:24:31.180 --> 2:24:33.660
 on some of these projects in the best possible way.

2:24:33.660 --> 2:24:34.980
 But in general, the prizes are great.

2:24:34.980 --> 2:24:37.380
 But what this kind of teaches me and reminds me

2:24:37.380 --> 2:24:39.900
 is sometimes in your life, there'll be moments

2:24:41.180 --> 2:24:46.180
 when the thing that you would really like to do,

2:24:47.580 --> 2:24:49.700
 society would really like you to do,

2:24:50.740 --> 2:24:53.940
 is the thing that goes against something you believe in,

2:24:53.940 --> 2:24:56.060
 whatever that is, some kind of principle.

2:24:56.060 --> 2:24:59.860
 And standing your ground in the face of that

2:24:59.860 --> 2:25:03.060
 is something I believe most people will have

2:25:03.060 --> 2:25:05.100
 a few moments like that in their life,

2:25:05.100 --> 2:25:07.460
 maybe one moment like that, and you have to do it.

2:25:07.460 --> 2:25:09.100
 That's what integrity is.

2:25:09.100 --> 2:25:10.460
 So like, it doesn't have to make sense

2:25:10.460 --> 2:25:12.340
 to the rest of the world, but to stand on that,

2:25:12.340 --> 2:25:16.060
 like to say no, it's interesting, because I think.

2:25:16.060 --> 2:25:17.740
 But do you know that he turned down the prize

2:25:17.740 --> 2:25:20.020
 in service of some principle?

2:25:20.020 --> 2:25:20.980
 Because I don't know that.

2:25:20.980 --> 2:25:22.740
 Well, yes, that seems to be the inkling,

2:25:22.740 --> 2:25:24.540
 but he has never made it super clear.

2:25:24.540 --> 2:25:26.900
 But the inkling is that he had some problems

2:25:26.900 --> 2:25:30.220
 with the whole process of mathematics that includes awards,

2:25:30.220 --> 2:25:33.500
 like this hierarchies and the reputations

2:25:33.500 --> 2:25:34.500
 and all those kinds of things,

2:25:34.500 --> 2:25:37.660
 and individualism that's fundamental to American culture.

2:25:37.660 --> 2:25:41.140
 He probably, because he visited the United States quite a bit

2:25:41.140 --> 2:25:46.140
 that he probably, it's all about experiences.

2:25:47.380 --> 2:25:51.500
 And he may have had some parts of academia,

2:25:51.500 --> 2:25:54.740
 some pockets of academia can be less than inspiring,

2:25:54.740 --> 2:25:57.580
 perhaps sometimes, because of the individual egos involved,

2:25:57.580 --> 2:26:01.180
 not academia, people in general, smart people with egos.

2:26:01.180 --> 2:26:05.620
 And if you interact with a certain kinds of people,

2:26:05.620 --> 2:26:07.460
 you can become cynical too easily.

2:26:07.460 --> 2:26:10.700
 I'm one of those people that I've been really fortunate

2:26:10.700 --> 2:26:12.820
 to interact with incredible people at MIT

2:26:12.820 --> 2:26:15.500
 and academia in general, but I've met some assholes.

2:26:15.500 --> 2:26:17.060
 And I tend to just kind of,

2:26:17.060 --> 2:26:19.140
 when I run into difficult folks,

2:26:19.140 --> 2:26:21.340
 I just kind of smile and send them all my love

2:26:21.340 --> 2:26:23.100
 and just kind of go around.

2:26:23.100 --> 2:26:26.700
 But for others, those experiences can be sticky.

2:26:26.700 --> 2:26:29.820
 Like they can become cynical about the world

2:26:29.820 --> 2:26:31.660
 when folks like that exist.

2:26:31.660 --> 2:26:35.500
 So he may have become a little bit cynical

2:26:35.500 --> 2:26:37.220
 about the process of science.

2:26:37.220 --> 2:26:38.620
 Well, you know, it's a good opportunity.

2:26:38.620 --> 2:26:40.220
 Let's posit that that's his reasoning

2:26:40.220 --> 2:26:42.380
 because I truly don't know.

2:26:42.380 --> 2:26:43.820
 It's an interesting opportunity to go back

2:26:43.820 --> 2:26:46.340
 to almost the very first thing we talked about,

2:26:46.340 --> 2:26:48.380
 the idea of the Mathematical Olympiad,

2:26:48.380 --> 2:26:50.540
 because of course that is,

2:26:50.540 --> 2:26:52.100
 so the International Mathematical Olympiad

2:26:52.100 --> 2:26:54.620
 is like a competition for high school students

2:26:54.620 --> 2:26:55.860
 solving math problems.

2:26:55.860 --> 2:26:59.180
 And in some sense, it's absolutely false

2:26:59.180 --> 2:27:00.380
 to the reality of mathematics,

2:27:00.380 --> 2:27:02.060
 because just as you say,

2:27:02.060 --> 2:27:05.220
 it is a contest where you win prizes.

2:27:07.380 --> 2:27:10.140
 The aim is to sort of be faster than other people.

2:27:11.860 --> 2:27:13.860
 And you're working on sort of canned problems

2:27:13.860 --> 2:27:15.700
 that someone already knows the answer to,

2:27:15.700 --> 2:27:18.500
 like not problems that are unknown.

2:27:18.500 --> 2:27:20.580
 So, you know, in my own life,

2:27:20.580 --> 2:27:21.900
 I think when I was in high school,

2:27:21.900 --> 2:27:24.260
 I was like very motivated by those competitions.

2:27:24.260 --> 2:27:26.140
 And like, I went to the Math Olympiad and...

2:27:26.140 --> 2:27:28.580
 You won it twice and got, I mean...

2:27:28.580 --> 2:27:30.180
 Well, there's something I have to explain to people

2:27:30.180 --> 2:27:32.220
 because it says, I think it says on Wikipedia

2:27:32.220 --> 2:27:33.420
 that I won a gold medal.

2:27:33.420 --> 2:27:35.220
 And in the real Olympics,

2:27:35.220 --> 2:27:37.420
 they only give one gold medal in each event.

2:27:37.420 --> 2:27:38.460
 I just have to emphasize

2:27:38.460 --> 2:27:40.820
 that the International Math Olympiad is not like that.

2:27:40.820 --> 2:27:42.220
 The gold medals are awarded

2:27:42.220 --> 2:27:44.980
 to the top 112th of all participants.

2:27:44.980 --> 2:27:47.260
 So sorry to bust the legend or anything like that.

2:27:47.260 --> 2:27:48.860
 Well, you're an exceptional performer

2:27:48.860 --> 2:27:51.860
 in terms of achieving high scores on the problems

2:27:51.860 --> 2:27:53.220
 and they're very difficult.

2:27:53.220 --> 2:27:56.300
 So you've achieved a high level of performance on the...

2:27:56.300 --> 2:27:57.900
 In this very specialized skill.

2:27:57.900 --> 2:28:00.540
 And by the way, it was a very Cold War activity.

2:28:00.540 --> 2:28:02.900
 You know, in 1987, the first year I went,

2:28:02.900 --> 2:28:04.620
 it was in Havana.

2:28:04.620 --> 2:28:06.140
 Americans couldn't go to Havana back then.

2:28:06.140 --> 2:28:08.740
 It was a very complicated process to get there.

2:28:08.740 --> 2:28:10.860
 And they took the whole American team on a field trip

2:28:10.860 --> 2:28:14.140
 to the Museum of American Imperialism in Havana

2:28:14.140 --> 2:28:17.580
 so we could see what America was all about.

2:28:17.580 --> 2:28:22.580
 How would you recommend a person learn math?

2:28:22.980 --> 2:28:26.380
 So somebody who's young or somebody my age

2:28:26.380 --> 2:28:29.740
 or somebody older who've taken a bunch of math

2:28:29.740 --> 2:28:32.060
 but wants to rediscover the beauty of math

2:28:32.060 --> 2:28:34.260
 and maybe integrate it into their work

2:28:34.260 --> 2:28:38.540
 more solid in the research space and so on.

2:28:38.540 --> 2:28:44.220
 Is there something you could say about the process of...

2:28:44.220 --> 2:28:47.620
 Incorporating mathematical thinking into your life?

2:28:47.620 --> 2:28:48.900
 I mean, the thing is,

2:28:48.900 --> 2:28:50.860
 it's in part a journey of self knowledge.

2:28:50.860 --> 2:28:53.740
 You have to know what's gonna work for you

2:28:53.740 --> 2:28:55.940
 and that's gonna be different for different people.

2:28:55.940 --> 2:28:59.260
 So there are totally people who at any stage of life

2:28:59.260 --> 2:29:01.980
 just start reading math textbooks.

2:29:01.980 --> 2:29:03.660
 That is a thing that you can do

2:29:03.660 --> 2:29:06.580
 and it works for some people and not for others.

2:29:06.580 --> 2:29:09.620
 For others, a gateway is, I always recommend

2:29:09.620 --> 2:29:10.820
 the books of Martin Gardner,

2:29:10.820 --> 2:29:12.620
 another sort of person we haven't talked about

2:29:12.620 --> 2:29:16.860
 but who also, like Conway, embodies that spirit of play.

2:29:16.860 --> 2:29:19.460
 He wrote a column in Scientific American for decades

2:29:19.460 --> 2:29:20.980
 called Mathematical Recreations

2:29:20.980 --> 2:29:23.940
 and there's such joy in it and such fun.

2:29:23.940 --> 2:29:26.580
 And these books, the columns are collected into books

2:29:26.580 --> 2:29:27.660
 and the books are old now

2:29:27.660 --> 2:29:29.740
 but for each generation of people who discover them,

2:29:29.740 --> 2:29:31.420
 they're completely fresh.

2:29:31.420 --> 2:29:33.860
 And they give a totally different way into the subject

2:29:33.860 --> 2:29:36.420
 than reading a formal textbook,

2:29:36.420 --> 2:29:40.060
 which for some people would be the right thing to do.

2:29:40.060 --> 2:29:42.260
 And working contest style problems too,

2:29:42.260 --> 2:29:43.740
 those are bound to books,

2:29:43.740 --> 2:29:45.660
 especially like Russian and Bulgarian problems.

2:29:45.660 --> 2:29:47.740
 There's book after book problems from those contexts.

2:29:47.740 --> 2:29:50.060
 That's gonna motivate some people.

2:29:50.060 --> 2:29:51.580
 For some people, it's gonna be like watching

2:29:51.580 --> 2:29:54.300
 well produced videos, like a totally different format.

2:29:54.300 --> 2:29:56.060
 Like I feel like I'm not answering your question.

2:29:56.060 --> 2:29:57.780
 I'm sort of saying there's no one answer

2:29:57.780 --> 2:30:00.340
 and it's a journey where you figure out

2:30:00.340 --> 2:30:01.900
 what resonates with you.

2:30:01.900 --> 2:30:04.300
 For some people, it's the self discovery

2:30:04.300 --> 2:30:06.780
 is trying to figure out why is it that I wanna know?

2:30:06.780 --> 2:30:07.620
 Okay, I'll tell you a story.

2:30:07.620 --> 2:30:09.500
 Once when I was in grad school,

2:30:09.500 --> 2:30:11.540
 I was very frustrated with my lack of knowledge

2:30:11.540 --> 2:30:13.140
 of a lot of things as we all are

2:30:13.140 --> 2:30:14.100
 because no matter how much we know,

2:30:14.100 --> 2:30:15.820
 we don't know much more and going to grad school

2:30:15.820 --> 2:30:17.220
 means just coming face to face

2:30:17.220 --> 2:30:20.340
 with the incredible overflowing vault of your ignorance.

2:30:20.340 --> 2:30:23.740
 So I told Joe Harris, who was an algebraic geometer,

2:30:23.740 --> 2:30:26.140
 a professor in my department,

2:30:26.140 --> 2:30:27.620
 I was like, I really feel like I don't know enough

2:30:27.620 --> 2:30:29.340
 and I should just take a year of leave

2:30:29.340 --> 2:30:32.620
 and just read EGA, the holy textbook,

2:30:32.620 --> 2:30:34.420
 Elements de Géométrie Algebraique,

2:30:34.420 --> 2:30:36.900
 the Elements of Algebraic Geometry.

2:30:36.900 --> 2:30:38.660
 I'm just gonna, I feel like I don't know enough

2:30:38.660 --> 2:30:42.060
 so I'm just gonna sit and read this like 1500 page

2:30:42.060 --> 2:30:44.060
 many volume book.

2:30:46.900 --> 2:30:48.300
 And he was like, and Professor Harris was like,

2:30:48.300 --> 2:30:49.500
 that's a really stupid idea.

2:30:49.500 --> 2:30:50.820
 And I was like, why is that a stupid idea?

2:30:50.820 --> 2:30:52.660
 Then I would know more algebraic geometry.

2:30:52.660 --> 2:30:53.940
 He's like, because you're not actually gonna do it.

2:30:53.940 --> 2:30:55.780
 Like you learn.

2:30:55.780 --> 2:30:57.140
 I mean, he knew me well enough to say like,

2:30:57.140 --> 2:30:58.860
 you're gonna learn because you're gonna be working

2:30:58.860 --> 2:31:01.060
 on a problem and then there's gonna be a fact from EGA

2:31:01.060 --> 2:31:03.020
 that you need in order to solve your problem

2:31:03.020 --> 2:31:05.300
 that you wanna solve and that's how you're gonna learn it.

2:31:05.300 --> 2:31:06.820
 You're not gonna learn it without a problem

2:31:06.820 --> 2:31:08.020
 to bring you into it.

2:31:08.020 --> 2:31:10.660
 And so for a lot of people, I think if you're like,

2:31:10.660 --> 2:31:12.420
 I'm trying to understand machine learning

2:31:12.420 --> 2:31:14.460
 and I'm like, I can see that there's sort of

2:31:14.460 --> 2:31:19.460
 some mathematical technology that I don't have,

2:31:19.460 --> 2:31:22.580
 I think you like let that problem

2:31:22.580 --> 2:31:26.060
 that you actually care about drive your learning.

2:31:26.060 --> 2:31:28.340
 I mean, one thing I've learned from advising students,

2:31:28.340 --> 2:31:31.220
 math is really hard.

2:31:32.260 --> 2:31:35.940
 In fact, anything that you do right is hard.

2:31:38.180 --> 2:31:41.420
 And because it's hard, like you might sort of have some idea

2:31:41.420 --> 2:31:44.540
 that somebody else gives you, oh, I should learn X, Y and Z.

2:31:44.540 --> 2:31:46.460
 Well, if you don't actually care, you're not gonna do it.

2:31:46.460 --> 2:31:47.500
 You might feel like you should,

2:31:47.500 --> 2:31:48.940
 maybe somebody told you you should,

2:31:48.940 --> 2:31:51.820
 but I think you have to hook it to something

2:31:51.820 --> 2:31:52.780
 that you actually care about.

2:31:52.780 --> 2:31:54.580
 So for a lot of people, that's the way in.

2:31:54.580 --> 2:31:57.260
 You have an engineering problem you're trying to handle,

2:31:57.260 --> 2:31:59.580
 you have a physics problem you're trying to handle,

2:31:59.580 --> 2:32:02.100
 you have a machine learning problem you're trying to handle.

2:32:02.100 --> 2:32:05.020
 Let that not a kind of abstract idea

2:32:05.020 --> 2:32:08.420
 of what the curriculum is, drive your mathematical learning.

2:32:08.420 --> 2:32:12.260
 And also just as a brief comment that math is hard,

2:32:12.260 --> 2:32:15.300
 there's a sense to which hard is a feature, not a bug,

2:32:15.300 --> 2:32:17.060
 in the sense that, again,

2:32:17.060 --> 2:32:19.820
 maybe this is my own learning preference,

2:32:19.820 --> 2:32:24.500
 but I think it's a value to fall in love with the process

2:32:24.500 --> 2:32:27.980
 of doing something hard, overcoming it,

2:32:27.980 --> 2:32:29.740
 and becoming a better person because of it.

2:32:29.740 --> 2:32:32.180
 Like I hate running, I hate exercise,

2:32:32.180 --> 2:32:34.540
 to bring it down to like the simplest hard.

2:32:35.700 --> 2:32:39.740
 And I enjoy the part once it's done,

2:32:39.740 --> 2:32:41.980
 the person I feel like in the rest of the day

2:32:41.980 --> 2:32:44.100
 once I've accomplished it, the actual process,

2:32:44.100 --> 2:32:47.540
 especially the process of getting started in the initial,

2:32:47.540 --> 2:32:49.580
 like it really, I don't feel like doing it.

2:32:49.580 --> 2:32:51.660
 And I really have, the way I feel about running

2:32:51.660 --> 2:32:55.060
 is the way I feel about really anything difficult

2:32:55.060 --> 2:32:58.460
 in the intellectual space, especially in mathematics,

2:32:58.460 --> 2:33:01.820
 but also just something that requires

2:33:01.820 --> 2:33:04.820
 like holding a bunch of concepts in your mind

2:33:04.820 --> 2:33:08.220
 with some uncertainty, like where the terminology

2:33:08.220 --> 2:33:10.220
 or the notation is not very clear.

2:33:10.220 --> 2:33:13.300
 And so you have to kind of hold all those things together

2:33:13.300 --> 2:33:16.020
 and like keep pushing forward through the frustration

2:33:16.020 --> 2:33:20.220
 of really like obviously not understanding certain like

2:33:20.220 --> 2:33:23.660
 parts of the picture, like your giant missing parts

2:33:23.660 --> 2:33:26.580
 of the picture and still not giving up.

2:33:26.580 --> 2:33:28.980
 It's the same way I feel about running.

2:33:28.980 --> 2:33:32.820
 And there's something about falling in love

2:33:32.820 --> 2:33:36.140
 with the feeling of after you went through the journey

2:33:36.140 --> 2:33:38.180
 of not having a complete picture,

2:33:38.180 --> 2:33:40.620
 at the end having a complete picture,

2:33:40.620 --> 2:33:42.460
 and then you get to appreciate the beauty

2:33:42.460 --> 2:33:46.020
 and just remembering that it sucked for a long time

2:33:46.020 --> 2:33:48.780
 and how great it felt when you figured it out,

2:33:48.780 --> 2:33:49.940
 at least at the basic.

2:33:49.940 --> 2:33:52.020
 That's not sort of research thinking,

2:33:52.020 --> 2:33:55.220
 because with research, you probably also have to

2:33:55.220 --> 2:34:00.220
 enjoy the dead ends with learning math

2:34:00.980 --> 2:34:02.540
 from a textbook or from video.

2:34:02.540 --> 2:34:03.380
 There's a nice.

2:34:03.380 --> 2:34:04.580
 I don't think you have to enjoy the dead ends,

2:34:04.580 --> 2:34:06.340
 but I think you have to accept the dead ends.

2:34:06.340 --> 2:34:07.980
 Let's put it that way.

2:34:08.900 --> 2:34:11.020
 Well, yeah, enjoy the suffering of it.

2:34:11.020 --> 2:34:16.020
 So the way I think about it, I do, there's an.

2:34:17.060 --> 2:34:18.300
 I don't enjoy the suffering.

2:34:18.300 --> 2:34:19.140
 It pisses me off.

2:34:19.140 --> 2:34:21.220
 You have to accept that it's part of the process.

2:34:21.220 --> 2:34:22.060
 It's interesting.

2:34:22.060 --> 2:34:24.540
 There's a lot of ways to kind of deal with that dead end.

2:34:24.540 --> 2:34:26.460
 There's a guy who's the ultra marathon runner,

2:34:26.460 --> 2:34:30.340
 Navy SEAL, David Goggins, who kind of,

2:34:30.340 --> 2:34:32.780
 I mean, there's a certain philosophy of like,

2:34:34.020 --> 2:34:35.980
 most people would quit here.

2:34:37.740 --> 2:34:42.420
 And so if most people would quit here and I don't,

2:34:42.420 --> 2:34:45.140
 I'll have an opportunity to discover something beautiful

2:34:45.140 --> 2:34:46.380
 that others haven't yet.

2:34:46.380 --> 2:34:51.380
 And so like any feeling that really sucks,

2:34:52.940 --> 2:34:56.980
 it's like, okay, most people would just like,

2:34:56.980 --> 2:34:58.620
 go do something smarter.

2:34:58.620 --> 2:35:00.220
 And if I stick with this,

2:35:01.220 --> 2:35:06.140
 I will discover a new garden of fruit trees that I can pick.

2:35:06.140 --> 2:35:07.500
 Okay, you say that, but like,

2:35:07.500 --> 2:35:09.100
 what about the guy who like wins

2:35:09.100 --> 2:35:11.300
 the Nathan's hot dog eating contest every year?

2:35:11.300 --> 2:35:13.020
 Like when he eats his 35th hot dog,

2:35:13.020 --> 2:35:14.180
 he like correctly says like,

2:35:14.180 --> 2:35:17.020
 okay, most people would stop here.

2:35:17.020 --> 2:35:18.460
 Are you like lauding that he's like,

2:35:18.460 --> 2:35:20.020
 no, I'm gonna eat the 35th hot dog.

2:35:20.020 --> 2:35:21.580
 I am, I am.

2:35:21.580 --> 2:35:26.300
 In the long arc of history, that man is onto something.

2:35:26.300 --> 2:35:28.420
 Which brings up this question.

2:35:28.420 --> 2:35:30.980
 What advice would you give to young people today,

2:35:30.980 --> 2:35:34.020
 thinking about their career, about their life,

2:35:34.020 --> 2:35:37.300
 whether it's in mathematics, poetry,

2:35:37.300 --> 2:35:39.420
 or hot dog eating contest?

2:35:40.660 --> 2:35:41.940
 And you know, I have kids,

2:35:41.940 --> 2:35:43.900
 so this is actually a live issue for me, right?

2:35:43.900 --> 2:35:45.740
 I actually, it's not a thought experiment.

2:35:45.740 --> 2:35:47.140
 I actually do have to give advice

2:35:47.140 --> 2:35:48.540
 to two young people all the time.

2:35:48.540 --> 2:35:50.540
 They don't listen, but I still give it.

2:35:53.180 --> 2:35:55.420
 You know, one thing I often say to students,

2:35:55.420 --> 2:35:56.820
 I don't think I've actually said this to my kids yet,

2:35:56.820 --> 2:35:59.860
 but I say it to students a lot is,

2:35:59.860 --> 2:36:02.100
 you know, you come to these decision points

2:36:03.100 --> 2:36:06.620
 and everybody is beset by self doubt, right?

2:36:06.620 --> 2:36:09.780
 It's like, not sure like what they're capable of,

2:36:09.780 --> 2:36:14.780
 like not sure what they really wanna do.

2:36:14.780 --> 2:36:16.540
 I always, I sort of tell people like,

2:36:16.540 --> 2:36:18.540
 often when you have a decision to make,

2:36:20.260 --> 2:36:22.740
 one of the choices is the high self esteem choice.

2:36:22.740 --> 2:36:24.620
 And I always tell them, make the high self esteem choice.

2:36:24.620 --> 2:36:26.780
 Make the choice, sort of take yourself out of it

2:36:26.780 --> 2:36:29.620
 and like, if you didn't have those,

2:36:29.620 --> 2:36:31.980
 you can probably figure out what the version of you

2:36:31.980 --> 2:36:34.100
 that feels completely confident would do.

2:36:35.020 --> 2:36:36.500
 And do that and see what happens.

2:36:36.500 --> 2:36:40.100
 And I think that's often like pretty good advice.

2:36:40.100 --> 2:36:40.940
 That's interesting.

2:36:40.940 --> 2:36:44.060
 Sort of like, you know, like with Sims,

2:36:44.060 --> 2:36:45.420
 you can create characters.

2:36:45.420 --> 2:36:47.820
 Create a character of yourself

2:36:47.820 --> 2:36:50.260
 that lacks all the self doubt.

2:36:50.260 --> 2:36:51.340
 Right, but it doesn't mean,

2:36:51.340 --> 2:36:52.940
 I would never say to somebody,

2:36:52.940 --> 2:36:56.220
 you should just go have high self esteem.

2:36:56.220 --> 2:36:57.180
 You shouldn't have doubts.

2:36:57.180 --> 2:36:58.220
 No, you probably should have doubts.

2:36:58.220 --> 2:36:59.340
 It's okay to have them.

2:36:59.340 --> 2:37:01.660
 But sometimes it's good to act in the way

2:37:01.660 --> 2:37:04.240
 that the person who didn't have them would act.

2:37:04.240 --> 2:37:08.420
 That's a really nice way to put it.

2:37:08.420 --> 2:37:13.020
 Yeah, that's like from a third person perspective,

2:37:13.020 --> 2:37:16.500
 take the part of your brain that wants to do big things.

2:37:16.500 --> 2:37:18.140
 What would they do?

2:37:18.140 --> 2:37:20.020
 That's not afraid to do those things.

2:37:20.020 --> 2:37:21.480
 What would they do?

2:37:21.480 --> 2:37:24.420
 Yeah, that's really nice.

2:37:24.420 --> 2:37:26.300
 That's actually a really nice way to formulate it.

2:37:26.300 --> 2:37:27.540
 That's very practical advice.

2:37:27.540 --> 2:37:29.140
 You should give it to your kids.

2:37:31.140 --> 2:37:32.660
 Do you think there's meaning to any of it

2:37:32.660 --> 2:37:35.780
 from a mathematical perspective, this life?

2:37:36.700 --> 2:37:37.820
 If I were to ask you,

2:37:39.180 --> 2:37:42.480
 we talked about primes, talked about proving stuff.

2:37:43.540 --> 2:37:47.340
 Can we say, and then the book that God has,

2:37:47.340 --> 2:37:49.540
 that mathematics allows us to arrive

2:37:49.540 --> 2:37:51.800
 at something about in that book.

2:37:51.800 --> 2:37:52.820
 There's certainly a chapter

2:37:52.820 --> 2:37:54.980
 on the meaning of life in that book.

2:37:54.980 --> 2:37:57.380
 Do you think we humans can get to it?

2:37:57.380 --> 2:37:59.500
 And maybe if you were to write cliff notes,

2:37:59.500 --> 2:38:01.520
 what do you suspect those cliff notes would say?

2:38:01.520 --> 2:38:04.860
 I mean, look, the way I feel is that mathematics,

2:38:04.860 --> 2:38:07.580
 as we've discussed, it underlies the way we think

2:38:07.580 --> 2:38:09.240
 about constructing learning machines.

2:38:09.240 --> 2:38:10.580
 It underlies physics.

2:38:11.780 --> 2:38:12.620
 It can be used.

2:38:12.620 --> 2:38:14.620
 I mean, it does all this stuff.

2:38:15.740 --> 2:38:17.180
 And also you want the meaning of life?

2:38:17.180 --> 2:38:18.820
 I mean, it's like, we already did a lot for you.

2:38:18.820 --> 2:38:19.880
 Like, ask a rabbi.

2:38:22.580 --> 2:38:25.900
 No, I mean, I wrote a lot in the last book,

2:38:25.900 --> 2:38:27.700
 How Not to Be Wrong.

2:38:27.700 --> 2:38:32.380
 I wrote a lot about Pascal, a fascinating guy who is

2:38:32.380 --> 2:38:35.180
 a sort of very serious religious mystic,

2:38:35.180 --> 2:38:37.260
 as well as being an amazing mathematician.

2:38:37.260 --> 2:38:38.900
 And he's well known for Pascal's wager.

2:38:38.900 --> 2:38:40.260
 I mean, he's probably among all mathematicians.

2:38:40.260 --> 2:38:42.340
 He's the one who's best known for this.

2:38:42.340 --> 2:38:44.140
 Can you actually like apply mathematics

2:38:44.140 --> 2:38:48.940
 to kind of these transcendent questions?

2:38:49.900 --> 2:38:53.020
 But what's interesting when I really read Pascal

2:38:53.020 --> 2:38:54.780
 about what he wrote about this,

2:38:54.780 --> 2:38:56.300
 I started to see that people often think,

2:38:56.300 --> 2:38:58.940
 oh, this is him saying, I'm gonna use mathematics

2:39:00.060 --> 2:39:03.340
 to sort of show you why you should believe in God.

2:39:03.340 --> 2:39:07.220
 You know, mathematics has the answer to this question.

2:39:07.220 --> 2:39:08.940
 But he really doesn't say that.

2:39:08.940 --> 2:39:11.900
 He almost kind of says the opposite.

2:39:11.900 --> 2:39:15.140
 If you ask Blaise Pascal, like, why do you believe in God?

2:39:15.140 --> 2:39:16.580
 He'd be like, oh, cause I met God.

2:39:16.580 --> 2:39:20.140
 You know, he had this kind of like psychedelic experience.

2:39:20.140 --> 2:39:23.400
 It's like a mystical experience where as he tells it,

2:39:23.400 --> 2:39:24.980
 he just like directly encountered God.

2:39:24.980 --> 2:39:26.820
 It's like, okay, I guess there's a God, I met him last night.

2:39:26.820 --> 2:39:27.980
 So that's it.

2:39:27.980 --> 2:39:29.100
 That's why he believed.

2:39:29.100 --> 2:39:30.340
 It didn't have to do with any kind.

2:39:30.340 --> 2:39:32.540
 You know, the mathematical argument was like

2:39:33.700 --> 2:39:36.780
 about certain reasons for behaving in a certain way.

2:39:36.780 --> 2:39:38.340
 But he basically said, like, look,

2:39:38.340 --> 2:39:41.100
 like math doesn't tell you that God's there or not.

2:39:41.100 --> 2:39:43.420
 Like, if God's there, he'll tell you.

2:39:43.420 --> 2:39:45.180
 You know, you don't even.

2:39:45.180 --> 2:39:46.020
 I love this.

2:39:46.020 --> 2:39:50.500
 So you have mathematics, you have, what do you have?

2:39:50.500 --> 2:39:53.780
 Like a way to explore the mind, let's say psychedelics.

2:39:53.780 --> 2:39:56.620
 You have like incredible technology.

2:39:56.620 --> 2:39:59.700
 You also have love and friendship.

2:39:59.700 --> 2:40:01.820
 And like, what the hell do you want to know

2:40:01.820 --> 2:40:02.920
 what the meaning of it all is?

2:40:02.920 --> 2:40:03.980
 Just enjoy it.

2:40:03.980 --> 2:40:07.020
 I don't think there's a better way to end it, Jordan.

2:40:07.020 --> 2:40:08.540
 This was a fascinating conversation.

2:40:08.540 --> 2:40:13.540
 I really love the way you explore math in your writing.

2:40:14.140 --> 2:40:18.460
 The willingness to be specific and clear

2:40:18.460 --> 2:40:21.200
 and actually explore difficult ideas,

2:40:21.200 --> 2:40:23.100
 but at the same time stepping outside

2:40:23.100 --> 2:40:25.060
 and figuring out beautiful stuff.

2:40:25.060 --> 2:40:30.060
 And I love the chart at the opening of your new book

2:40:30.380 --> 2:40:33.280
 that shows the chaos, the mess that is your mind.

2:40:33.280 --> 2:40:35.540
 Yes, this is what I was trying to keep in my head

2:40:35.540 --> 2:40:38.020
 all at once while I was writing.

2:40:38.020 --> 2:40:40.300
 And I probably should have drawn this picture

2:40:40.300 --> 2:40:41.300
 earlier in the process.

2:40:41.300 --> 2:40:43.100
 Maybe it would have made my organization easier.

2:40:43.100 --> 2:40:45.420
 I actually drew it only at the end.

2:40:45.420 --> 2:40:48.640
 And many of the things we talked about are on this map.

2:40:48.640 --> 2:40:52.660
 The connections are yet to be fully dissected, investigated.

2:40:52.660 --> 2:40:56.740
 And yes, God is in the picture.

2:40:56.740 --> 2:40:59.460
 Right on the edge, right on the edge, not in the center.

2:41:00.820 --> 2:41:01.660
 Thank you so much for talking to me.

2:41:01.660 --> 2:41:03.460
 It is a huge honor that you would waste

2:41:03.460 --> 2:41:04.820
 your valuable time with me.

2:41:05.820 --> 2:41:06.660
 Thank you, Lex.

2:41:06.660 --> 2:41:07.820
 We went to some amazing places today.

2:41:07.820 --> 2:41:09.620
 This was really fun.

2:41:09.620 --> 2:41:11.220
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:41:11.220 --> 2:41:12.380
 with Jordan Ellenberg.

2:41:12.380 --> 2:41:16.660
 And thank you to Secret Sauce, ExpressVPN, Blinkist,

2:41:16.660 --> 2:41:17.980
 and Indeed.

2:41:17.980 --> 2:41:21.380
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:41:21.380 --> 2:41:24.140
 And now let me leave you with some words from Jordan

2:41:24.140 --> 2:41:26.720
 in his book, How Not To Be Wrong.

2:41:26.720 --> 2:41:30.600
 Knowing mathematics is like wearing a pair of X ray specs

2:41:30.600 --> 2:41:33.500
 that reveal hidden structures underneath the messy

2:41:33.500 --> 2:41:35.780
 and chaotic surface of the world.

2:41:35.780 --> 2:42:02.780
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
