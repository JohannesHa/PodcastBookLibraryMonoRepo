00:00.000 --> 00:02.480
 The following is a conversation with Rick Doblin,

00:02.480 --> 00:04.640
 founder and executive director

00:04.640 --> 00:06.920
 of the Multidisciplinary Association

00:06.920 --> 00:09.720
 for Psychedelic Studies, MAPS.

00:09.720 --> 00:11.520
 He is one of the seminal figures

00:11.520 --> 00:12.920
 in both the cultural history

00:12.920 --> 00:15.440
 and the cutting edge science of psychedelics.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.360
 He was there along with the biggest characters

00:18.360 --> 00:20.800
 throughout this fascinating history of psychedelics,

00:20.800 --> 00:23.660
 and he is here to tell the story.

00:23.660 --> 00:25.360
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:25.360 --> 00:29.660
 Theragun, ExpressVPN, Blinkist, and Asleep.

00:29.660 --> 00:33.240
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:33.240 --> 00:34.960
 As a side note, let me say

00:34.960 --> 00:37.800
 that exploring the places the human mind can go

00:37.800 --> 00:40.120
 can help us understand where it comes from,

00:40.120 --> 00:43.640
 how it works, and how to engineer mental journeys,

00:43.640 --> 00:46.360
 whether that's through life experiences,

00:46.360 --> 00:49.100
 chemical substances, brain computer interfaces,

00:49.100 --> 00:52.800
 or interactions with artificial intelligence systems.

00:52.800 --> 00:56.160
 On a personal level, I think the dissolution of the ego

00:56.160 --> 00:58.120
 for stretches of time is a powerful tool

00:58.120 --> 01:00.080
 for understanding yourself.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.740
 A lot of things can do this,

01:01.740 --> 01:04.800
 including jiu jitsu, literature, meditation,

01:04.800 --> 01:07.880
 but psychedelics is definitely, or at least arguably,

01:07.880 --> 01:11.720
 one of the most powerful, from psilocybin to DMT.

01:11.720 --> 01:13.520
 I'm excited that people like Rick

01:13.520 --> 01:15.400
 are leading the scientific research

01:15.400 --> 01:18.880
 that reveals the efficacy and the safety of these substances

01:18.880 --> 01:22.400
 so that their proper dosage and usage protocols

01:22.400 --> 01:24.720
 can be understood and people like me

01:24.720 --> 01:27.240
 can safely and effectively use them,

01:27.240 --> 01:29.720
 not just for recreation,

01:29.720 --> 01:33.600
 but for rigorous exploration of my own mind.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.600
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,

01:35.600 --> 01:38.840
 and here is my conversation with Rick Doblin.

01:39.960 --> 01:42.760
 Could you give an introduction to psychedelics,

01:42.760 --> 01:47.200
 like a big, bold, whirlwind overview?

01:47.200 --> 01:48.920
 What are psychedelics?

01:48.920 --> 01:51.640
 What are the kinds of psychedelics out there?

01:51.640 --> 01:54.920
 In whatever way you think is meaningful.

01:54.920 --> 01:58.040
 All right, well, when I started MAPS,

01:58.040 --> 02:00.800
 the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies,

02:00.800 --> 02:04.080
 it was very important for me that psychedelic be in the name.

02:04.080 --> 02:07.760
 And the way in which the original meaning of psychedelic,

02:09.600 --> 02:11.680
 it's mind manifesting.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.520
 It was created by Humphrey Osmond

02:13.520 --> 02:17.160
 in a dialogue with Aldous Huxley.

02:17.160 --> 02:20.440
 And so psychedelic means mind manifesting.

02:20.440 --> 02:24.480
 And so we interpret that very broadly

02:24.480 --> 02:27.600
 to mean dreams are psychedelic.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.520
 Anything that kind of brings things to the surface,

02:30.520 --> 02:34.160
 holotropic breath work, hyperventilation is psychedelic.

02:34.160 --> 02:35.560
 So most people think psychedelic

02:35.560 --> 02:37.920
 is only about certain kind of chemical substances,

02:37.920 --> 02:40.260
 either natural or synthetic,

02:40.260 --> 02:42.920
 but we've got a much broader view of that.

02:42.920 --> 02:45.500
 Meditation can be psychedelic in some ways,

02:45.500 --> 02:48.120
 but our primary focus is on the drugs,

02:48.120 --> 02:52.140
 is on the medicines or the, you might call them,

02:52.140 --> 02:55.760
 some people might call them spiritual tools or sacraments.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.520
 There's sort of two general categories of those.

03:00.520 --> 03:03.200
 One are what are called the classic psychedelics,

03:03.200 --> 03:05.240
 and those are the ego dissolving,

03:06.480 --> 03:10.200
 sort of merged into unitive states.

03:10.200 --> 03:15.120
 Those are like LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, ayahuasca,

03:15.120 --> 03:18.160
 ibogaine, DMT, things like that.

03:18.160 --> 03:21.520
 And then there is MDMA, which some people even argue

03:21.520 --> 03:22.880
 is not a psychedelic.

03:22.880 --> 03:25.520
 They'll say it's an empathogen or an intactogen,

03:25.520 --> 03:28.000
 it's about touching within or empathy.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.720
 It doesn't do the same kind of ego dissolution

03:32.160 --> 03:35.040
 that the classic psychedelics do,

03:35.040 --> 03:37.560
 but it brings material to the surface

03:39.280 --> 03:41.980
 and it changes the way we process information.

03:44.160 --> 03:48.680
 And so I think you can quibble about whether it's,

03:48.680 --> 03:50.480
 it's certainly not a classic psychedelic,

03:50.480 --> 03:52.680
 but I think MDMA is also a psychedelic.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.760
 Marijuana, I would say, is a psychedelic.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.240
 Marijuana is closer to the classic psychedelics

03:58.240 --> 04:00.040
 than it is to MDMA.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.120
 One point I like to make is dreams,

04:03.120 --> 04:05.560
 because then everybody can relate to that.

04:05.560 --> 04:06.560
 Dreams are psychedelic.

04:06.560 --> 04:11.560
 Dreams bring emotions, feelings, ideas, concepts,

04:12.880 --> 04:14.480
 in symbolic form a lot of times,

04:14.480 --> 04:16.440
 or just in raw emotions to the surface.

04:16.440 --> 04:19.100
 So when people hear the word psychedelic,

04:19.100 --> 04:22.120
 often they are frightened by it.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.040
 It's about loss of control.

04:25.240 --> 04:29.200
 And it is, to an extent, loss of conscious control,

04:29.200 --> 04:31.960
 particularly with the classic psychedelics.

04:31.960 --> 04:33.080
 And we know with dreams

04:33.080 --> 04:35.560
 that we can have frightening dreams, nightmares,

04:35.560 --> 04:40.560
 but I think that anchoring the concept of psychedelic

04:40.560 --> 04:43.000
 in dreams is really helpful for people to know

04:43.000 --> 04:45.460
 that it's kind of a natural state

04:45.460 --> 04:48.320
 and that there are other ways that you can catalyze it

04:48.320 --> 04:49.640
 than by going to sleep,

04:49.640 --> 04:51.640
 and that for thousands of years,

04:51.640 --> 04:54.160
 substances have been used in that way.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.920
 So you mentioned this idea of bringing something

04:55.920 --> 04:58.540
 to the surface, which is really interesting.

04:58.540 --> 05:01.640
 So can you maybe elaborate the surface

05:01.640 --> 05:04.880
 and what is there in the depths of things

05:04.880 --> 05:09.880
 and how does ego dissolution fits into that?

05:10.040 --> 05:13.460
 Well, Aldous Huxley talked about the brain

05:13.460 --> 05:15.260
 as a reducing valve,

05:15.260 --> 05:18.120
 that we have an enormous amount of information.

05:18.120 --> 05:20.240
 So right now there's an air conditioning sound

05:20.240 --> 05:21.880
 in the background,

05:21.880 --> 05:24.360
 but that's not crucial to what you and I are doing,

05:24.360 --> 05:27.560
 talking to each other, so we kind of tune that out.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.800
 There's all sorts of sights and sounds.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.160
 There's incoming information

05:32.160 --> 05:36.080
 in all the different sense modalities,

05:36.080 --> 05:41.080
 and we have to figure out what's important to us.

05:42.020 --> 05:47.020
 And so the mind, in a way, focuses a lot on

05:47.020 --> 05:50.300
 what are our core needs?

05:50.300 --> 05:53.420
 And we filter all the incoming information

05:53.420 --> 05:55.860
 that we get towards focusing on what our core needs,

05:55.860 --> 05:58.580
 and we can even get to Abraham Maslow

05:58.580 --> 06:01.580
 and the hierarchy of needs about survival needs,

06:01.580 --> 06:04.720
 belonging needs, esteem needs, go on.

06:04.720 --> 06:09.720
 So I think what I mean by bringing things to the surface

06:09.720 --> 06:16.720
 is that we tend to not focus on a lot of things

06:17.600 --> 06:21.760
 that are coming, but we also push away

06:21.760 --> 06:24.160
 things that are difficult emotionally,

06:24.160 --> 06:26.760
 difficult cognitively.

06:26.760 --> 06:29.360
 We all know that we're on this very short trajectory

06:29.360 --> 06:30.360
 from birth to death,

06:30.360 --> 06:32.880
 but we're not constantly thinking about dying,

06:35.160 --> 06:37.480
 although that can actually be helpful

06:37.480 --> 06:39.900
 to focus us on what's really important.

06:40.960 --> 06:44.000
 Traumas are often suppressed.

06:46.080 --> 06:49.480
 Conflicts, we see in America and around the world

06:49.480 --> 06:51.640
 a kind of rise of irrationality

06:53.680 --> 06:56.280
 where people push away their logic

06:56.280 --> 07:01.240
 in order for their emotional tribal needs to be met.

07:01.240 --> 07:04.880
 A lot of people are suffering from early childhood traumas

07:04.880 --> 07:06.880
 of a different kinds or abandonment issues

07:06.880 --> 07:08.040
 or anything.

07:08.040 --> 07:11.840
 So we tend to focus on just what we need to survive

07:11.840 --> 07:13.920
 and what we need for work and esteem.

07:13.920 --> 07:18.920
 And so psychedelics, by dissolving this ego control

07:19.580 --> 07:23.980
 or by with MDMA kind of strengthening our sense of self

07:23.980 --> 07:25.940
 and our sense of self acceptance,

07:25.940 --> 07:28.740
 we can bring in other information

07:28.740 --> 07:32.360
 that have previously been too complicated or too painful.

07:32.360 --> 07:33.800
 You don't think of psychedelics

07:33.800 --> 07:36.520
 as conjuring up something new.

07:36.520 --> 07:39.680
 It is more revealing something that is already there.

07:39.680 --> 07:41.600
 I think that's a very crucial thing.

07:41.600 --> 07:46.600
 So yes, Sasha Shulgin who sort of the godfather of MDMA,

07:51.320 --> 07:52.980
 he sort of rediscovered it

07:52.980 --> 07:57.600
 and brought it back into use.

07:57.600 --> 08:01.240
 He talked about his first experience was with mescaline.

08:01.240 --> 08:04.360
 His first psychedelic experience was with mescaline

08:04.360 --> 08:06.000
 and he had a tremendous experience.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.520
 But what he said about it was he was having

08:09.520 --> 08:13.800
 a human experience that the mescaline was helping him access

08:13.800 --> 08:17.760
 rather than that he was having a mescaline experience.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.660
 So that it's not like you pop a pill

08:19.660 --> 08:21.640
 and you always have the same kind of experience

08:21.640 --> 08:22.560
 as everybody else.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.760
 The experience is not contained in the pill.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.360
 The pill opens you up

08:26.360 --> 08:28.420
 and you have an experience of yourself.

08:29.320 --> 08:30.840
 Sometimes these are experiences

08:30.840 --> 08:32.600
 that we've never consciously had.

08:32.600 --> 08:35.400
 But we can say right now that we know

08:35.400 --> 08:39.760
 that our body below the level of our conscious awareness

08:39.760 --> 08:42.560
 has all these self healing mechanisms.

08:42.560 --> 08:45.520
 And we don't modulate them

08:46.840 --> 08:48.640
 to a large extent by conscious control.

08:48.640 --> 08:51.420
 I mean, eventually we are learning more about the mind body

08:51.420 --> 08:53.080
 and we learn about the placebo effect,

08:53.080 --> 08:54.280
 how what we think is the case.

08:54.280 --> 08:57.800
 But I think that there's experiences

08:57.800 --> 09:00.660
 that are below our level of conscious awareness,

09:00.660 --> 09:02.080
 particularly once we're adults

09:02.080 --> 09:04.720
 that are more of these unit of mystical experiences,

09:04.720 --> 09:06.200
 sense of connection.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.680
 I think kids are like this a lot.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.720
 We kind of come from the void, you could say,

09:09.720 --> 09:11.080
 and you're born and you have

09:12.860 --> 09:14.520
 a different way of processing information.

09:14.520 --> 09:18.320
 One interesting point about that has to do with ketamine,

09:18.320 --> 09:22.560
 which is been approved as ketamine for depression,

09:22.560 --> 09:25.440
 but it's used for anesthesia.

09:25.440 --> 09:29.800
 And roughly one 10th the anesthetic dose

09:29.800 --> 09:31.840
 is a psychedelic dose.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.360
 And when it's used in anesthesia,

09:34.360 --> 09:36.520
 there's what's called the emergent phenomena.

09:36.520 --> 09:40.380
 So this is, you get enough ketamine for,

09:40.380 --> 09:42.360
 you can be operated on, you're not in pain,

09:42.360 --> 09:44.840
 you're not really there, your ego's knocked out,

09:44.840 --> 09:46.600
 but you can still breathe.

09:46.600 --> 09:49.240
 But as the operations get over

09:49.240 --> 09:52.000
 and then people metabolize the ketamine,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.780
 there's a process that they call the emergent phenomena.

09:54.780 --> 09:58.840
 It's like as you're emerging from this tranquilized state,

09:58.840 --> 10:01.020
 and that's where you pass through the psychedelic phase.

10:01.020 --> 10:03.520
 And they don't prepare people for that.

10:03.520 --> 10:07.000
 And what we see is that a lot of adults

10:07.000 --> 10:09.200
 have difficult times with that,

10:09.200 --> 10:12.120
 but children don't seem to have those problems.

10:12.120 --> 10:15.960
 Children are a little bit more already in this kind of state.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.880
 And so ketamine is used quite frequently

10:18.880 --> 10:21.140
 in children now for anesthesia.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.600
 So all of that is to say to your question

10:24.600 --> 10:27.120
 that I think the psychedelics

10:27.120 --> 10:29.180
 reveal things that are within us.

10:30.120 --> 10:32.800
 Some things that are how we process information

10:32.800 --> 10:35.000
 back when we were children.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.960
 Other things that we've never thought of before

10:36.960 --> 10:40.040
 that are sort of baked into our consciousness.

10:41.960 --> 10:46.160
 There's one drug, 5MeO DMT.

10:46.160 --> 10:49.920
 It's this toxin from a Sonoran toad

10:49.920 --> 10:52.200
 that many people consider it to be the most powerful

10:52.200 --> 10:54.020
 of all the psychedelics.

10:54.020 --> 10:57.660
 And it kind of knocks the ego structures completely out of it

10:57.660 --> 11:01.500
 and we experience something different,

11:01.500 --> 11:03.760
 but it's something I think that's always within us.

11:03.760 --> 11:04.800
 It's at a deeper layer.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.260
 So we knock out some of the higher cognitive functions

11:07.260 --> 11:09.240
 and then we experience things in a different way.

11:09.240 --> 11:13.080
 So my sense is that these are human experiences

11:13.080 --> 11:15.080
 that the psychedelics bring us to.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.440
 Yeah, it's really profound.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.960
 And DMT is a really interesting example.

11:18.960 --> 11:23.160
 So Terence McKenna has talked about these machine elves.

11:24.040 --> 11:28.820
 And there's this, I think from the people I've heard speak

11:28.820 --> 11:30.280
 about the experience,

11:30.280 --> 11:33.800
 there's a sense that you are traveling elsewhere

11:33.800 --> 11:38.080
 to meet entities, whether they're elves or not.

11:38.080 --> 11:42.640
 So in your sense, you're not traveling elsewhere.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.760
 You're just revealing something that's within

11:44.760 --> 11:47.720
 and maybe it's a particular mechanism

11:47.720 --> 11:50.220
 of revealing what's already within.

11:50.220 --> 11:51.640
 Yeah, and I knew Terence.

11:51.640 --> 11:53.400
 I spent a lot of time talking with Terence

11:53.400 --> 11:58.200
 and I do not ascribe to a lot of things that he was saying.

11:58.200 --> 12:02.040
 He was a tremendous entertainer and I think he did a lot

12:02.040 --> 12:03.680
 of really good things and focused us

12:03.680 --> 12:05.960
 on the power of psychedelics.

12:05.960 --> 12:10.220
 But I think I've never seen these quote machine elves.

12:10.220 --> 12:14.160
 I think culture is more determinative

12:14.160 --> 12:17.240
 of what people experience under psychedelics,

12:17.240 --> 12:22.120
 your preconceptions, than we give it credit for.

12:22.120 --> 12:26.920
 And so I think there's a lot of priming that you could say

12:26.920 --> 12:30.560
 that people receive by stories from their culture.

12:33.120 --> 12:37.000
 With ayahuasca, it's about jaguars and Amazonian animals.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.920
 And so I think these machine elves are this construct

12:41.920 --> 12:46.880
 of Terence that other people do see.

12:46.880 --> 12:50.560
 There's actually some people that are very interested

12:50.560 --> 12:54.280
 in doing a study and that they're well funded

12:54.280 --> 12:59.280
 and moving toward it to keep people on an IV infusion

12:59.320 --> 13:02.600
 of DMT for them specifically to see,

13:02.600 --> 13:05.480
 do they contact machine elves or aliens

13:05.480 --> 13:07.480
 and what kind of information do they bring back

13:07.480 --> 13:12.280
 from these other selves, other places or other entities?

13:14.320 --> 13:16.520
 One question is, who are we?

13:16.520 --> 13:20.480
 Are we connected to everything in the universe?

13:20.480 --> 13:23.060
 We certainly know in many cases,

13:23.060 --> 13:27.160
 you talk about waves or particles, the quantum approach.

13:27.160 --> 13:32.160
 So I don't interpret experiences that we have

13:32.600 --> 13:36.460
 of some entity that's somehow or other

13:36.460 --> 13:39.480
 deep in our consciousness that's not us.

13:39.480 --> 13:41.680
 It's a part of who we are.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.480
 So I tend to interpret it in that way.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.440
 The question is, how big are we?

13:49.560 --> 13:52.840
 And how many ideas are within us

13:52.840 --> 13:56.120
 that can be revealed by changing the perspective?

13:56.120 --> 13:57.440
 You mentioned physics.

13:59.240 --> 14:03.040
 What physicists, especially mathematical physicists

14:03.040 --> 14:07.200
 or mathematicians do is they reveal truths

14:07.200 --> 14:12.200
 by taking a slightly different perspective on a problem

14:12.440 --> 14:17.200
 that reveals the simplicity of how it actually works

14:17.200 --> 14:18.760
 in totally new ways.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.200
 That's what Einstein did.

14:20.200 --> 14:23.200
 Like every progress in physics

14:23.200 --> 14:25.600
 and certainly every progress in mathematics

14:25.600 --> 14:28.000
 requires you to take a different perspective.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.560
 And then perhaps that's exactly what psychedelics are doing.

14:32.560 --> 14:36.840
 It's not that they're contacting aliens that are elsewhere.

14:36.840 --> 14:39.280
 It may be revealing the connection between us

14:39.280 --> 14:41.240
 and other living life forms,

14:41.240 --> 14:43.360
 or actually it might be revealing

14:45.000 --> 14:47.300
 a totally new perspective on what life is

14:47.300 --> 14:50.800
 or what consciousness is and giving us a glimpse at that

14:50.800 --> 14:53.920
 even though our cognitive capabilities are limited

14:53.920 --> 14:56.040
 to fully grasp and understand it.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.480
 So it's just giving us an inkling of that somehow.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.080
 And it seems perhaps a little ridiculous

15:01.080 --> 15:03.520
 not from a scientific perspective

15:03.520 --> 15:06.620
 in the sense that we don't have a good physics of life

15:06.620 --> 15:09.900
 or physics of intelligence or physics of consciousness,

15:09.900 --> 15:11.920
 but getting a glimpse of that

15:11.920 --> 15:15.680
 is giving us a little bit of maybe an intuition

15:15.680 --> 15:20.680
 of which way to head to build such a physics.

15:22.240 --> 15:23.560
 Yeah, yeah, I think so.

15:23.560 --> 15:28.560
 I think that there's this other concept

15:28.600 --> 15:30.700
 I guess I would like to talk about briefly,

15:30.700 --> 15:33.540
 this Jungian collective unconscious,

15:33.540 --> 15:36.100
 this idea that somehow or other everything

15:36.100 --> 15:40.280
 that has ever happened is still accessible,

15:40.280 --> 15:43.720
 maybe not with as much data

15:43.720 --> 15:46.600
 or as much resolution,

15:46.600 --> 15:49.720
 but that there's wave resonances.

15:49.720 --> 15:54.720
 So that I do believe that we can have experiences

15:55.320 --> 15:58.280
 as part of this human collective unconscious

15:58.280 --> 16:01.080
 that we're not from our own life.

16:01.080 --> 16:01.920
 Yeah.

16:01.920 --> 16:06.240
 And that we can, it's like the holographic realities

16:06.240 --> 16:10.780
 and that there is a way to gather information

16:10.780 --> 16:13.640
 that can be accurate about other times and places

16:15.560 --> 16:20.040
 through depth investigations of our own consciousness.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.560
 But I think what I tend to believe

16:22.560 --> 16:26.040
 is that it's because there's emotional resonances

16:26.040 --> 16:28.840
 between where we're at now in this life

16:28.840 --> 16:33.840
 and other kind of experiences

16:35.520 --> 16:37.240
 that people have had before.

16:37.240 --> 16:40.440
 And we always hear about everybody

16:40.440 --> 16:41.560
 who talks about past lives,

16:41.560 --> 16:43.340
 they're always kings and queens.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.520
 So I think that's again,

16:46.520 --> 16:48.840
 you filter things what you want to be true.

16:48.840 --> 16:53.760
 But I do think that there is a way to access information

16:53.760 --> 16:58.120
 beyond what we've taken in in our own temporal existence

16:58.120 --> 16:59.720
 through our own five senses.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.560
 In some ways, I really find that compelling,

17:01.560 --> 17:04.160
 the notion that that information is already there

17:04.160 --> 17:08.160
 and you're simply just moving the attention of your mind

17:08.160 --> 17:10.040
 to different parts of that.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.280
 Yeah, I mean, we have that with the radio.

17:12.280 --> 17:17.000
 I mean, you got a frequency, you turn all this information,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.960
 you could actually say right now in the space between us,

17:19.960 --> 17:21.640
 we have the whole world's knowledge

17:21.640 --> 17:23.080
 that's up on the internet.

17:23.080 --> 17:24.560
 It's right here.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.480
 But we don't see it. We just have to tune in.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.320
 Yeah.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.680
 What are the interesting differences,

17:31.680 --> 17:34.560
 would you say, between the various psychedelics

17:34.560 --> 17:38.140
 that you mentioned, ayahuasca, DMT, acid, LSD,

17:38.140 --> 17:42.720
 marijuana, mescaline, PCP, psilocybin, MDMA?

17:42.720 --> 17:44.800
 You mentioned a few of them that are really interesting.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.800
 We'll talk about scientifically some of the different

17:47.800 --> 17:49.960
 studies that have been conducted on each,

17:49.960 --> 17:52.440
 but sort of at the high level.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.160
 What are some interesting differences?

17:54.160 --> 17:57.300
 Well, one of the big ones that people make a big deal of

17:57.300 --> 17:59.920
 that I think is completely misplaced

17:59.920 --> 18:03.080
 is some are from nature, some are from the lab.

18:03.080 --> 18:05.400
 So there's this kind of like romantic thought

18:05.400 --> 18:06.960
 that if it's from nature, it's good.

18:06.960 --> 18:10.600
 If it's from the lab, it's somehow tainted by humanity.

18:10.600 --> 18:13.960
 And therefore, some people are like

18:13.960 --> 18:15.480
 all for plant psychedelics.

18:15.480 --> 18:19.060
 We see the policy changes that have been happening

18:19.060 --> 18:23.280
 in a couple of cities, Cambridge, Somerville,

18:23.280 --> 18:24.720
 not far from where we're at now,

18:24.720 --> 18:27.320
 where they decriminalize plant medicines.

18:27.320 --> 18:29.320
 So they call it decriminalizing nature.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.800
 So I think that there is,

18:32.800 --> 18:36.360
 from my perspective,

18:37.360 --> 18:40.160
 certain things from nature are poison,

18:40.160 --> 18:44.800
 certain things from the lab are spiritual,

18:44.800 --> 18:47.600
 even if they don't show up in nature, like LSD.

18:47.600 --> 18:51.560
 Now there is something, LSD is lysergic acid diethylamide.

18:51.560 --> 18:54.800
 There is lysergic acid amide, LSA,

18:54.800 --> 18:56.320
 which comes from morning glory seeds.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.620
 So it's very similar.

18:57.620 --> 19:02.260
 But at the same time, I'd say,

19:02.260 --> 19:03.740
 I don't buy into that distinction

19:03.740 --> 19:06.260
 that there's some fundamental preference.

19:06.260 --> 19:07.860
 One of the things that Terence McKenna,

19:07.860 --> 19:09.460
 since we talked about him,

19:09.460 --> 19:12.500
 he talked about how if it's from nature, it's good.

19:12.500 --> 19:15.620
 And if it's not, we should be suspect.

19:16.540 --> 19:18.580
 Of course, he had a lot of great LSD experiences.

19:18.580 --> 19:22.060
 But actually Terence, in 1984,

19:22.060 --> 19:24.820
 we were at Esalen with a bunch of other people.

19:24.820 --> 19:27.780
 This was before the crackdown on MDMA.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.540
 And this was some of the underground therapists

19:31.540 --> 19:32.940
 and the above ground researchers

19:32.940 --> 19:36.340
 who were trying to talk about how to protect MDMA

19:36.340 --> 19:37.720
 from this eventual crackdown.

19:37.720 --> 19:40.300
 And Terence was like, forget about it.

19:40.300 --> 19:41.940
 It's from the lab.

19:41.940 --> 19:42.760
 It's dangerous.

19:42.760 --> 19:44.140
 We have thousands of years of history,

19:44.140 --> 19:45.220
 all these other things.

19:45.220 --> 19:48.460
 And what do we know about MDMA and blah, blah, blah.

19:48.460 --> 19:51.460
 I was like, Terence, you're so unscientific.

19:51.460 --> 19:54.300
 Another way to say it is, and I just said,

19:54.300 --> 19:58.100
 we need a study of the safety of MDMA.

19:58.100 --> 20:01.820
 And so then Dick Price, who started Esalen,

20:01.820 --> 20:04.180
 I said, I'll put a thousand, Dick Price, he put a thousand.

20:04.180 --> 20:06.100
 So Terence was actually the catalyst

20:06.100 --> 20:07.860
 for the first study with MDMA.

20:07.860 --> 20:10.580
 Just because he was so frustrating

20:10.580 --> 20:11.900
 about how plants are okay.

20:11.900 --> 20:14.740
 And if it's from the lab, it's bad.

20:14.740 --> 20:16.500
 So that's one distinction.

20:16.500 --> 20:19.780
 The other distinction is that he was a scientist.

20:19.780 --> 20:24.780
 The other distinction is this sense of classic psychedelics

20:26.420 --> 20:27.620
 versus things like MDMA.

20:27.620 --> 20:31.020
 So to what extent do they dissolve the ego?

20:31.020 --> 20:34.460
 And you could say, to what extent do they cause visions?

20:34.460 --> 20:37.620
 The 5HT2A serotonin receptor subtype,

20:39.060 --> 20:41.540
 which is responsible for a lot of that

20:41.540 --> 20:43.240
 where these drugs are activating.

20:45.460 --> 20:48.380
 Now, mescaline of all the psychedelics,

20:48.380 --> 20:51.100
 chemically, it's the most similar to MDMA.

20:51.100 --> 20:53.980
 It's a phenethylamine, which is MDMA.

20:53.980 --> 20:57.720
 So in the 50s, there was the, 53, I think it was,

20:57.720 --> 21:00.180
 the Army Chemical Warfare Service

21:00.180 --> 21:03.360
 wanted to look at drugs for interrogations,

21:03.360 --> 21:05.780
 mind control, nonlethal incapacitants.

21:05.780 --> 21:10.780
 They did a study in eight substances.

21:10.980 --> 21:13.740
 These were now toxicity studies in animals.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.620
 And on the one side was methamphetamine,

21:15.620 --> 21:18.740
 and the other was mescaline, and MDMA was in the middle,

21:18.740 --> 21:19.920
 chemically.

21:19.920 --> 21:23.500
 So mescaline of these psychedelics

21:23.500 --> 21:27.440
 tends to have the warmth that MDMA has.

21:27.440 --> 21:30.580
 It's not as ego dissolving quite as some of the others.

21:30.580 --> 21:32.620
 I mean, it's the main active ingredient in peyote.

21:32.620 --> 21:34.860
 It is very psychedelic, very visual.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.260
 Another distinction with these different drugs

21:39.260 --> 21:41.160
 is how long they last.

21:41.160 --> 21:45.080
 And a lot of that has to do with the route of administration.

21:45.080 --> 21:49.100
 So for example, if you smoke DMT,

21:49.100 --> 21:52.300
 it takes 10, 15 minutes, and you're,

21:52.300 --> 21:54.540
 within seconds, you're off in another world.

21:54.540 --> 21:59.540
 Similarly, 5MeO DMT, very rapid.

21:59.620 --> 22:03.140
 When you take DMT in the form of ayahuasca,

22:03.140 --> 22:05.740
 where it's mixed with another substance

22:05.740 --> 22:08.420
 that makes it so that it's orally active,

22:08.420 --> 22:10.360
 then it's a couple hours.

22:10.360 --> 22:15.360
 So LSD is eight, 10, 12 hours sometimes.

22:16.640 --> 22:18.880
 Psilocybin is more like five or six hours,

22:18.880 --> 22:21.280
 or four to six hours.

22:21.280 --> 22:22.760
 MDMA is similar.

22:23.720 --> 22:25.960
 It's one reason why in our research,

22:25.960 --> 22:28.080
 we give an initial dose of MDMA,

22:28.080 --> 22:28.960
 and then two hours later,

22:28.960 --> 22:32.440
 we give half the initial amount to extend the plateau,

22:32.440 --> 22:34.800
 because we want it to last longer

22:34.800 --> 22:37.100
 for people to be in this therapeutic state.

22:37.100 --> 22:42.100
 So that's another distinction is how long these drugs last.

22:42.300 --> 22:44.360
 Another distinction is which of them

22:44.360 --> 22:47.180
 come from a religious context,

22:47.180 --> 22:49.280
 have a religion built around them.

22:49.280 --> 22:52.180
 We have this sense that some people are saying

22:52.180 --> 22:54.820
 that 5MeO DMT and the Sonoran Toad,

22:54.820 --> 22:57.420
 that they have this long history of indigenous use,

22:57.420 --> 22:58.780
 but they don't, that's all modern,

22:58.780 --> 23:01.940
 it's made up, and it's kind of a new approach.

23:01.940 --> 23:05.100
 However, there was thousands of years of use

23:05.100 --> 23:08.020
 of psilocybin mushrooms in religious contexts.

23:09.260 --> 23:14.260
 From 1600 BC to 396 AD,

23:14.700 --> 23:17.100
 the world's longest mystery ceremonies,

23:17.100 --> 23:18.600
 the Eleusinian Mysteries,

23:19.900 --> 23:21.240
 sort of the heart of Greek culture,

23:21.240 --> 23:22.500
 the heart of Western culture,

23:22.500 --> 23:25.780
 that was a psychedelic potion called Kikion

23:25.780 --> 23:29.520
 that seems like it's very much like an LSD like substance.

23:29.520 --> 23:34.520
 Aragat on grain and LSD comes from Aragat.

23:36.920 --> 23:39.640
 So I think that there are a lot of ways

23:39.640 --> 23:41.120
 to look at these different substances.

23:41.120 --> 23:45.000
 Another distinction is which one of them

23:45.000 --> 23:48.280
 are being researched right now in scientific context

23:48.280 --> 23:49.240
 and which are not.

23:50.100 --> 23:52.720
 And because of the rise of all these for profit companies

23:52.720 --> 23:54.800
 and everybody's looking for what they can patent,

23:54.800 --> 23:57.440
 what they can claim, the land grab,

23:57.440 --> 24:01.200
 more and more there are companies

24:01.200 --> 24:04.360
 looking at every different kind of psychedelics.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.400
 The ones that are most important

24:06.400 --> 24:09.080
 that are not being researched, Mescaline,

24:09.080 --> 24:11.080
 but now there's a company to do Mescaline,

24:11.080 --> 24:14.000
 the Jernico Lab, Ibogaine,

24:14.000 --> 24:17.160
 which is crucial for opiate addiction.

24:17.160 --> 24:21.400
 There's a new company, a branch of this company,

24:21.400 --> 24:23.720
 Atai, that's gonna be looking at Ibogaine.

24:23.720 --> 24:27.480
 So I'd say the rise of the for profit companies

24:27.480 --> 24:30.200
 is making it so that there's just gonna be

24:30.200 --> 24:32.520
 an enormous amount of investigations

24:32.520 --> 24:36.000
 into all these different psychedelics.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.680
 But what we're gonna see is the development

24:39.680 --> 24:41.760
 of new psychedelics that we don't know anything about

24:41.760 --> 24:42.840
 that have not existed yet

24:42.840 --> 24:45.480
 because a lot of these for profit companies

24:45.480 --> 24:48.280
 are gonna wanna invent and patent

24:48.280 --> 24:51.880
 and have composition of matter patents on new molecules.

24:51.880 --> 24:53.680
 So I think we'll see a lot of that happening too.

24:53.680 --> 24:54.520
 That's really fascinating.

24:54.520 --> 24:57.520
 I mean, there's a lot of doors you've opened

24:57.520 --> 24:58.960
 and we're gonna walk through all of them,

24:58.960 --> 25:00.380
 including the research and so on,

25:00.380 --> 25:03.680
 but on this one little tangent

25:03.680 --> 25:06.480
 of the future of psychedelics,

25:06.480 --> 25:08.640
 so engineering new psychedelics,

25:08.640 --> 25:12.120
 can you comment on maybe the chemistry

25:12.120 --> 25:14.200
 and the biology of how psychedelics work

25:14.200 --> 25:17.480
 and where is the space of possible engineering

25:17.480 --> 25:19.080
 of psychedelics and what kind of things

25:19.080 --> 25:24.080
 might they unlock in terms of the possible places

25:24.560 --> 25:26.580
 our mind would be able to go

25:26.580 --> 25:31.580
 and the effects of that of improving health,

25:32.360 --> 25:35.760
 but maybe at the basic level of chemistry

25:35.760 --> 25:37.800
 and the space of what could be engineered?

25:39.000 --> 25:41.200
 Well, you reminded me,

25:41.200 --> 25:42.540
 I'll get to exactly what you said,

25:42.540 --> 25:45.760
 but you reminded me of a talk I heard

25:45.760 --> 25:49.160
 by Buckminster Fuller shortly before he died.

25:49.160 --> 25:52.960
 And what he talked about is how technology

25:52.960 --> 25:57.200
 was making things ever smaller,

25:57.200 --> 25:59.800
 that we are able to pack more and more information

25:59.800 --> 26:02.440
 into smaller and smaller spaces

26:02.440 --> 26:04.560
 and that we're developing technologies

26:04.560 --> 26:06.880
 of communications with people,

26:06.880 --> 26:08.780
 we now know the internet and things like that.

26:08.780 --> 26:13.280
 But what he said is that he thought the eventual evolution

26:13.280 --> 26:16.680
 of this sort of research would move

26:16.680 --> 26:20.360
 from this miniaturization to telepathy.

26:21.680 --> 26:22.840
 Yeah.

26:22.840 --> 26:24.640
 And that was like a shocking thing

26:24.640 --> 26:27.760
 for somebody like scientific like that to say that.

26:27.760 --> 26:31.440
 So will we unlock those parts

26:31.440 --> 26:33.760
 where I talked about the collective unconscious?

26:33.760 --> 26:38.760
 Will we be able to more consciously explore those areas?

26:39.280 --> 26:42.080
 So I think that that's a possibility.

26:42.080 --> 26:44.200
 There was Stan Groff,

26:44.200 --> 26:47.720
 who's the world's leading LSD researcher

26:47.720 --> 26:51.640
 and has been my mentor, his wife Brigida.

26:51.640 --> 26:54.200
 They were talking about stories that they had heard

26:54.200 --> 26:59.200
 about MDMA that people take

26:59.440 --> 27:01.880
 and then on top of that, they do 5MEO DMT.

27:02.760 --> 27:05.360
 And so you get this ego dissolution,

27:05.360 --> 27:09.240
 but underneath it, you have this sense of ego,

27:09.240 --> 27:14.240
 sort of sense of self safety, of self acceptance,

27:14.320 --> 27:15.260
 kind of grounds it.

27:15.260 --> 27:19.240
 So Stan was like, that's the future of psychiatry,

27:19.240 --> 27:21.680
 that you can watch without the terror

27:21.680 --> 27:22.960
 of the ego dissolution,

27:22.960 --> 27:24.600
 the sense that you're losing your mind

27:24.600 --> 27:26.240
 or you're going crazy or you're dying,

27:26.240 --> 27:29.920
 or that you have this grounded sense of safety

27:29.920 --> 27:32.160
 while you're dissolving your normal sense

27:32.160 --> 27:33.840
 of how you see things.

27:33.840 --> 27:37.300
 And being able to engineer in a fine tuned way

27:37.300 --> 27:41.020
 that exact experience, maybe fine tuned to the person,

27:41.020 --> 27:43.240
 as opposed to sort of this manual potion

27:43.240 --> 27:46.960
 that's through experiment.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.760
 Although I don't know about fine tuning things

27:48.760 --> 27:50.680
 to the person in the sense that

27:50.680 --> 27:52.320
 we believe there's this inner healer,

27:52.320 --> 27:55.080
 this kind of inner healing intelligence.

27:55.080 --> 27:57.980
 We talked about it, the body repairs itself.

27:57.980 --> 28:02.980
 So I think we more need to create safety for people

28:03.860 --> 28:06.200
 and then what emerges will be customized

28:06.200 --> 28:07.480
 to what they need to be looking at

28:07.480 --> 28:09.160
 from this inner healing intelligence.

28:09.160 --> 28:11.320
 At the same time, we will move to,

28:12.400 --> 28:17.400
 we hear so much about the new approaches to oncology

28:18.560 --> 28:23.260
 where you do genetic analysis of different kinds of tumors

28:23.260 --> 28:25.960
 and then you have certain kind of chemotherapy agents

28:25.960 --> 28:27.980
 and you do like personalized chemotherapy.

28:27.980 --> 28:29.840
 I think we will have more like

28:29.840 --> 28:32.040
 personalized psychedelic therapy,

28:32.040 --> 28:34.680
 but it'll be more like a sequence of different drugs

28:34.680 --> 28:37.440
 that people go through over an extended period of time

28:37.440 --> 28:40.320
 and then you kind of customize what's next

28:40.320 --> 28:42.560
 and sometimes you'll combine different drugs together

28:42.560 --> 28:45.440
 like this 5MeO DMT and MDMA

28:45.440 --> 28:48.920
 or a lot of times people do LSD MDMA combinations

28:48.920 --> 28:51.100
 or psilocybin MDMA combinations.

28:52.720 --> 28:56.720
 Chemistry is not my strength.

28:56.720 --> 29:01.200
 I'm more into clinical applications and policy,

29:01.200 --> 29:03.760
 but I can say that from what I've learned

29:03.760 --> 29:06.920
 from reading from others and research done by others

29:06.920 --> 29:10.540
 that different psychedelics have an impact

29:10.540 --> 29:12.440
 on different neurotransmitters,

29:12.440 --> 29:14.920
 different other parts of energies in the brain.

29:16.400 --> 29:20.480
 The default mode network is what's considered

29:20.480 --> 29:25.480
 to be like our sense of self and it's part of the brain

29:25.780 --> 29:27.240
 that sort of is what I described before,

29:27.240 --> 29:30.260
 scanning the world and filtering information

29:30.260 --> 29:33.400
 for what's really important to us

29:33.400 --> 29:36.260
 and both focusing us on things

29:36.260 --> 29:39.180
 and also helping us to ignore a lot of things.

29:40.440 --> 29:43.840
 And the classic psychedelics all weaken the energy

29:43.840 --> 29:45.920
 in this default mode system

29:45.920 --> 29:48.000
 and therefore you get this flood of information

29:48.000 --> 29:49.840
 that you're not normally paying attention to

29:49.840 --> 29:52.840
 and then you start seeing in the more creative waves

29:52.840 --> 29:56.360
 or more connected, you actually move to

29:56.360 --> 29:57.980
 beyond the verbal kind of thinking

29:57.980 --> 30:01.400
 into sort of symbolic thinking a lot of times

30:01.400 --> 30:03.840
 and that's where you sometimes get

30:03.840 --> 30:06.620
 these mystical sense of connection, how it's all one

30:06.620 --> 30:11.620
 and you get the sense also of how big the universe is

30:12.560 --> 30:14.480
 and how small each one of us is.

30:15.520 --> 30:18.520
 So there's a lot of work that Sasha Shulgin

30:18.520 --> 30:20.940
 and Albert Hoffman who invented LSD

30:20.940 --> 30:22.320
 and first synthesized psilocybin

30:22.320 --> 30:24.960
 on what they call structure activity relationships.

30:24.960 --> 30:27.300
 What is the structural molecule

30:27.300 --> 30:31.000
 and then how do you predict what that new molecule

30:31.000 --> 30:33.320
 that never existed before is going to do

30:33.320 --> 30:35.520
 once you actually take it?

30:35.520 --> 30:40.520
 And you can get close, but you never really know

30:40.680 --> 30:43.020
 until you actually take the drug.

30:43.020 --> 30:47.480
 And the way that Sasha ran his experiments

30:47.480 --> 30:51.920
 is that he would take the drugs himself first in low doses

30:51.920 --> 30:55.000
 and he would sort of step up the doses

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
 to have more experiences.

30:56.000 --> 30:56.960
 If he thought it was valuable,

30:56.960 --> 30:58.720
 he'd share it with his wife, Ann,

30:58.720 --> 31:01.280
 but then what they would do is

31:01.280 --> 31:02.560
 if they both thought it was valuable,

31:02.560 --> 31:04.920
 they had a group of 12 people

31:04.920 --> 31:07.360
 that they were with for many, many years

31:07.360 --> 31:10.800
 and they would distribute these new drug to these 12 people

31:10.800 --> 31:13.560
 and they would get the different perspectives.

31:13.560 --> 31:15.920
 And he felt that 12 was like a minimum number

31:15.920 --> 31:18.840
 because we're so unique how each of us see things,

31:18.840 --> 31:21.040
 but then you kind of get a little bit of a consensus

31:21.040 --> 31:22.560
 on how a lot of people are gonna see it

31:22.560 --> 31:25.580
 and then if that 12 people were positive about it,

31:25.580 --> 31:27.360
 then they would turn it over to Leo Zeph,

31:27.360 --> 31:29.240
 who we called the secret chief,

31:29.240 --> 31:31.320
 the leader of the underground psychedelic therapy movement

31:31.320 --> 31:33.760
 and then he would start exploring it in therapy.

31:34.760 --> 31:38.320
 So there's still a lot of mysteries

31:38.320 --> 31:40.560
 as far as structure activity relationships

31:40.560 --> 31:43.400
 and it's not gonna be the case that people go into the lab

31:43.400 --> 31:45.400
 and they tinker with molecules

31:45.400 --> 31:47.600
 and they know exactly what they're gonna get.

31:48.760 --> 31:50.360
 And a lot of it has to do with

31:51.560 --> 31:54.840
 not so much chemistry as morphology.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.720
 You could say the shape of the molecule

31:56.720 --> 31:59.560
 and how does that interact with receptor sites.

31:59.560 --> 32:02.120
 And so we're getting better at modeling all of that.

32:03.400 --> 32:04.800
 And how does that interaction relate

32:04.800 --> 32:08.280
 to the morphing of the human experience

32:08.280 --> 32:11.040
 and deeply understanding that perhaps

32:11.040 --> 32:13.200
 there's no equations yet for that kind of thing.

32:13.200 --> 32:17.240
 You really have to build up intuition by experiencing it.

32:17.240 --> 32:20.620
 And over time and sort of subjective self report,

32:20.620 --> 32:22.960
 like trying to build an understanding

32:22.960 --> 32:24.800
 of the effects of the different chemistries.

32:24.800 --> 32:29.280
 Yeah, you can have approximate ideas, but to know exactly.

32:29.280 --> 32:34.080
 So when I first tried MDMA, which was 1982

32:34.080 --> 32:37.400
 and this was after I had done lots of LSD

32:37.400 --> 32:41.200
 and mescaline and mushrooms,

32:41.200 --> 32:44.600
 I was shocked at how different it was

32:44.600 --> 32:49.280
 than these other substances and yet how profound it was.

32:49.280 --> 32:52.120
 So are there whole new kind of categories

32:52.120 --> 32:54.600
 of classes of drugs that we're not aware of

32:54.600 --> 32:59.600
 that would be not so much this like eco dissolution

33:00.120 --> 33:01.960
 or emotional?

33:01.960 --> 33:05.880
 Well, what MDMA does is reduces activity in the amygdala,

33:05.880 --> 33:08.220
 the fear processing part of the brain.

33:08.220 --> 33:11.160
 So it's not just chemistry, but it routes energy

33:11.160 --> 33:12.680
 throughout the brain in a different way.

33:12.680 --> 33:15.880
 It increases activity in the prefrontal cortex.

33:15.880 --> 33:17.600
 So you think more logically,

33:17.600 --> 33:21.680
 that I think has an enormous impact on the effect of MDMA.

33:21.680 --> 33:25.200
 The other thing it does is it increases connectivity

33:25.200 --> 33:26.760
 between the amygdala and the hippocampus.

33:26.760 --> 33:30.340
 So it helps facilitate processing of things

33:30.340 --> 33:31.720
 into longterm memory.

33:32.820 --> 33:35.440
 And with PTSD, trauma is like never in the past,

33:35.440 --> 33:36.520
 it's always about to happen.

33:36.520 --> 33:39.560
 So will we one time develop drugs

33:39.560 --> 33:43.520
 that would even be specific to certain kinds of memories?

33:43.520 --> 33:46.400
 We're working with a woman, Rachel Yehuda,

33:46.400 --> 33:50.120
 who is at the Bronx VA,

33:50.120 --> 33:52.320
 and she's done some studies

33:52.320 --> 33:55.320
 that are with the epigenetics of trauma.

33:55.320 --> 33:58.800
 So she's worked with Holocaust survivors and their children,

33:58.800 --> 34:03.560
 and she has identified epigenetic mechanisms

34:03.560 --> 34:05.120
 by which trauma is passed

34:05.120 --> 34:07.400
 from generation to the generations.

34:07.400 --> 34:10.120
 Sort of like set points for anxiety,

34:10.120 --> 34:11.760
 fear, certain things like that.

34:11.760 --> 34:16.080
 But the question is, can you actually transmit memories

34:16.080 --> 34:18.720
 from one generation to the next?

34:18.720 --> 34:22.360
 Now, this is not DNA changes

34:24.360 --> 34:26.520
 which happen over a very long period of time

34:26.520 --> 34:28.760
 and evolutionary scale.

34:28.760 --> 34:31.680
 But within one lifetime, within some experiences,

34:31.680 --> 34:34.240
 your epigenetics, what turns on the genes

34:34.240 --> 34:37.160
 or turns off certain genes, that can be impacted.

34:37.160 --> 34:39.560
 And that's what we know now can be transmitted

34:39.560 --> 34:41.880
 from generation to generation,

34:41.880 --> 34:43.560
 either by the father or the mother

34:43.560 --> 34:45.820
 through the sperm or the egg.

34:45.820 --> 34:48.720
 So it's pretty remarkable.

34:48.720 --> 34:53.460
 So what Rachel's gonna try to do is MDMA research for PTSD

34:53.460 --> 34:56.400
 and look at these epigenetic markers before and after

34:56.400 --> 35:00.280
 and see if they change as a consequence of therapy.

35:00.280 --> 35:05.280
 So will we develop one day certain kind of chemicals

35:05.440 --> 35:08.080
 that will be able to bring certain kind of memories

35:08.080 --> 35:09.160
 to the surface?

35:10.400 --> 35:12.600
 That's not inconceivable.

35:12.600 --> 35:14.960
 The epigenetic angle is fascinating,

35:14.960 --> 35:17.600
 that there'll be these epigenetic perturbations

35:17.600 --> 35:19.840
 that lead to memories living

35:19.840 --> 35:22.840
 from one generation to the other

35:22.840 --> 35:25.200
 and then bringing those memories to the surface

35:25.200 --> 35:30.200
 and using that as signal to understand

35:30.280 --> 35:34.640
 what exactly the psychedelics bring to the surface and not.

35:34.640 --> 35:35.480
 Yeah, yeah.

35:35.480 --> 35:38.240
 Now, the other portion of that though is culture.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.680
 I mean, culture is where we store all these memories

35:40.680 --> 35:44.200
 and in the stories that we get passed out.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.000
 Especially with a lot of shared,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.880
 you talk about the Holocaust or World War II,

35:48.880 --> 35:53.560
 where it's deeply ingrained in the culture,

35:53.560 --> 35:55.360
 the impact of those events

35:55.360 --> 35:57.680
 and sort of in aggregate the different perspectives

35:57.680 --> 36:01.440
 on that particular event create a set of stories

36:01.440 --> 36:03.120
 that you can plug into.

36:03.120 --> 36:06.560
 And then they kind of resonate with some aspect of you

36:06.560 --> 36:09.560
 that creates a memory that's connected to,

36:09.560 --> 36:12.080
 like when I think about World War II and the Holocaust,

36:12.080 --> 36:13.760
 I think about my own family,

36:13.760 --> 36:15.700
 but in some sense,

36:15.700 --> 36:19.000
 it's also resonating with stories of many others.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.040
 So it's like somehow the two echo each other

36:22.040 --> 36:24.960
 and I'm just providing my own little flavor on top.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.760
 The meat of the stories

36:26.760 --> 36:29.280
 are probably those that are shared with others.

36:29.280 --> 36:32.320
 It's plugging into the collective unconscious.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.760
 That's really fascinating,

36:34.760 --> 36:38.720
 really plugging into like precisely

36:38.720 --> 36:40.680
 plugging into particular memories

36:40.680 --> 36:45.680
 as a way to deal with trauma and PTSD, that kind of thing.

36:47.960 --> 36:51.120
 Yeah, I'll just add that the most important dream

36:51.120 --> 36:54.180
 of my life ever was of a Holocaust survivor

36:54.180 --> 36:59.180
 telling me that he was miraculously saved from death

37:02.320 --> 37:04.780
 and he knew that he was saved for a particular purpose,

37:04.780 --> 37:06.560
 but he never knew what that purpose was.

37:06.560 --> 37:08.360
 So in the dream, I'm seeing him on his deathbed

37:08.360 --> 37:11.600
 and then he shows me whatever happened to him

37:11.600 --> 37:12.700
 during the Holocaust.

37:13.560 --> 37:16.360
 And then we're back in the room on his deathbed

37:16.360 --> 37:20.520
 and he says, well, I know what my purpose was now.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.100
 And I'm like, oh, great, what was it?

37:22.100 --> 37:24.440
 He says, it's to tell you to be a psychedelic therapist

37:24.440 --> 37:25.740
 and to study psychedelics

37:25.740 --> 37:28.440
 and bring back psychedelic research.

37:28.440 --> 37:31.920
 And I thought to myself, I've already decided to do this.

37:31.920 --> 37:33.080
 You can lay this on me.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.240
 I can say yes and then you can die in peace.

37:35.240 --> 37:38.160
 And then he died in front of my eyes in the dream.

37:38.160 --> 37:43.040
 So I think that that kind of cultural transmission

37:43.040 --> 37:45.680
 that I got from when I was really young,

37:45.680 --> 37:47.500
 then manifested in this dream.

37:47.500 --> 37:51.800
 And that was this story about how people

37:51.800 --> 37:55.240
 can be incredibly vicious

37:55.240 --> 37:58.920
 and can be very motivated by irrational factors.

37:58.920 --> 38:02.400
 And so I just feel that this kind of

38:02.400 --> 38:05.680
 multi generational transmission of this story

38:05.680 --> 38:09.240
 of the irrational being a murderous factor

38:10.800 --> 38:15.400
 and something I needed to respond to was deeply ingrained.

38:15.400 --> 38:19.960
 And I would say my guess is more culturally

38:19.960 --> 38:22.080
 than this epigenetic mechanism.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.440
 Yes.

38:23.440 --> 38:27.240
 Yeah, but your sense is that whatever stimulated

38:27.240 --> 38:32.240
 a certain part of human nature in World War II,

38:32.240 --> 38:37.240
 especially Nazi Germany, but also in Stalinist Soviet Union,

38:37.680 --> 38:40.280
 still is within us, within all of us.

38:40.280 --> 38:41.680
 Just like what we're saying,

38:44.520 --> 38:47.000
 we embody quite a lot of things.

38:47.000 --> 38:47.840
 Yeah.

38:47.840 --> 38:52.320
 And one of those is whatever the capacity for evil

38:53.680 --> 38:56.400
 seems to be one of those things.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.880
 Yeah, there's a quote from Carl Jung

38:58.880 --> 39:03.360
 from just a few years before he died.

39:03.360 --> 39:05.980
 What he says, and I'll just paraphrase it is

39:05.980 --> 39:09.220
 that we need to understand psychology.

39:10.200 --> 39:14.220
 We need to understand who man is,

39:14.220 --> 39:18.360
 that the greatest danger to us is man.

39:18.360 --> 39:22.680
 There are no other dangers really that impact our species.

39:23.760 --> 39:25.920
 And then he goes on to say that

39:25.920 --> 39:29.120
 we are the source of all coming evil.

39:30.120 --> 39:34.000
 Now this was 15 years or so after World War II.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.320
 But yeah, and I'd say one of the most important

39:36.320 --> 39:39.240
 psychedelic experiences of my life was a DMT experience.

39:39.240 --> 39:43.120
 Also Terrence was there, Ralph Metzner,

39:43.120 --> 39:44.880
 Andy Weil, a few others.

39:44.880 --> 39:49.880
 And we were sitting around at Esalen smoking DMT.

39:50.800 --> 39:53.440
 And under the influence of DMT,

39:53.440 --> 39:56.300
 which now this was the first time I've ever smoked DMT,

39:57.720 --> 40:01.260
 I had this super rapid fraction of a second,

40:01.260 --> 40:03.520
 like dissolving of everything that I,

40:03.520 --> 40:06.200
 well, first off I saw a horizontal line,

40:06.200 --> 40:09.060
 then I saw a vertical line, then it turned into a color,

40:09.060 --> 40:11.440
 red, then it was red, then it turned into cubes,

40:11.440 --> 40:14.220
 then it turned into like an MC Escher kind of like,

40:14.220 --> 40:17.040
 I don't know, you know, didn't make logical sense.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.700
 And then I was gone.

40:18.700 --> 40:23.340
 And then it was just this period of five, 10 minutes

40:23.340 --> 40:26.560
 of just feeling part of this enormous wave

40:26.560 --> 40:29.080
 of billions of years of evolution,

40:29.080 --> 40:32.740
 how I had this sense that in my innermost sense

40:32.740 --> 40:35.920
 of who I am uniquely individually,

40:35.920 --> 40:37.800
 this inner voice that's talking to me

40:37.800 --> 40:40.000
 that I didn't develop English,

40:40.000 --> 40:43.520
 that it's like a gift to me from millions of people.

40:43.520 --> 40:48.520
 So that even in my most innermost sense, it's not just me.

40:48.680 --> 40:51.060
 It's the product of everything that came before me.

40:51.060 --> 40:53.640
 I'm part of this bigger system.

40:53.640 --> 40:55.080
 And then I just thought, wow,

40:55.080 --> 40:57.240
 just how many billions of years does it take

40:57.240 --> 40:59.820
 to reach this point of self awareness and all this?

40:59.820 --> 41:01.080
 And it was glorious, beautiful.

41:01.080 --> 41:02.480
 And then I had this thought,

41:03.400 --> 41:06.860
 and this is where this kind of intellectual honesty,

41:06.860 --> 41:08.120
 I guess you could say, I just thought,

41:08.120 --> 41:09.360
 well, if I'm part of everything

41:09.360 --> 41:11.040
 and everything's part of me,

41:11.040 --> 41:12.880
 then it's not just the good parts,

41:12.880 --> 41:15.080
 that Hitler's part of me too.

41:15.080 --> 41:19.120
 And that was just this shock, like a stone sunk,

41:19.120 --> 41:22.800
 and I just was very moody for the whole next day.

41:22.800 --> 41:24.800
 But it was that acknowledgement

41:24.800 --> 41:27.440
 that each of us carries these potentials,

41:27.440 --> 41:29.460
 and what we activate is what matters,

41:29.460 --> 41:34.120
 but what our potential are is the whole full range of things.

41:34.120 --> 41:35.200
 I don't know if you can comment

41:35.200 --> 41:39.000
 about the DMT trip itself and what it's like,

41:39.000 --> 41:42.080
 starting from the very basic geometric shapes

41:42.080 --> 41:46.080
 and then launching yourself into the context

41:46.080 --> 41:50.140
 of the enormity of space and time in the human history.

41:52.400 --> 41:54.040
 Is there anything else to be said

41:54.040 --> 41:59.040
 about that kind of visually or physically

42:00.240 --> 42:02.760
 or emotionally about that journey?

42:02.760 --> 42:06.840
 What it's like, that brief journey that reveals so much?

42:07.900 --> 42:10.040
 Well, I was with a group of people.

42:10.040 --> 42:14.800
 The way we were doing it was each of us would smoke DMT,

42:14.800 --> 42:17.600
 have 10, 15 minutes experience while we closed our eyes,

42:17.600 --> 42:19.320
 and everybody else was just chatting,

42:19.320 --> 42:21.840
 and then the person who did the DMT would come back

42:21.840 --> 42:24.240
 and tell their story of what happened.

42:24.240 --> 42:26.000
 And then we'd think about it for a bit

42:26.000 --> 42:27.600
 and then pass the pipe to the next person.

42:27.600 --> 42:29.580
 And so this was like a whole evening.

42:30.920 --> 42:32.320
 So even the, sorry to interrupt,

42:32.320 --> 42:34.100
 even the conversations themselves then

42:34.100 --> 42:35.840
 is part of the experience.

42:35.840 --> 42:39.240
 Exactly, yes, yes, because it's also what you bring back.

42:39.240 --> 42:42.280
 I mean, I think that's particularly for therapy.

42:42.280 --> 42:45.240
 It's not so much about what the experience is,

42:45.240 --> 42:48.720
 but it's what you bring back and what do you integrate.

42:48.720 --> 42:52.560
 And then also, how do you learn how to do these things

42:52.560 --> 42:54.560
 on your own without the drugs?

42:54.560 --> 42:56.340
 There is this way, because we're saying

42:56.340 --> 42:58.360
 it's sort of a core human experience,

42:58.360 --> 43:01.920
 the drug is the mediator, but can we do this on our own?

43:01.920 --> 43:04.440
 And once you've seen it and felt it,

43:04.440 --> 43:06.000
 then you have a little bit better sense

43:06.000 --> 43:08.240
 to recreate it on your own.

43:08.240 --> 43:11.860
 Although, I've had dreams where I've been doing LSD

43:11.860 --> 43:14.560
 and tripping and it was just incredible.

43:14.560 --> 43:17.320
 It was, I was tripping in my dreams,

43:17.320 --> 43:19.760
 but I had not taken LSD.

43:19.760 --> 43:22.020
 So there's this way in which we do that.

43:22.020 --> 43:26.040
 So I would say that from the DMT experience,

43:26.040 --> 43:28.160
 the sense of safety, that's what I was trying to get at

43:28.160 --> 43:30.760
 with this, the group of us and this group of friends

43:30.760 --> 43:32.500
 trying to do this common exploration,

43:32.500 --> 43:34.880
 that if you have this sense of safety,

43:34.880 --> 43:38.200
 you're incredibly vulnerable

43:38.200 --> 43:43.080
 because you are giving up your awareness really

43:43.080 --> 43:44.840
 of what's happening around you.

43:44.840 --> 43:49.440
 I think there's, what we're finding is that

43:49.440 --> 43:52.960
 in our psychedelic research for PTSD

43:54.860 --> 43:56.480
 and what we see with the vaccines,

43:56.480 --> 43:59.200
 that even African Americans are reluctant

43:59.200 --> 44:02.560
 to volunteer for vaccines because they haven't had

44:02.560 --> 44:05.700
 that sense of safety from the medical establishment.

44:05.700 --> 44:10.500
 They don't volunteer for psychedelic therapy even as much.

44:10.500 --> 44:14.280
 So the overlay has to be this sense of safety

44:14.280 --> 44:18.300
 as you become vulnerable and looking inside, you're not.

44:18.300 --> 44:22.180
 I was just actually told about how there's a lot of work

44:22.180 --> 44:25.520
 being done inside prisons to teach mindfulness.

44:25.520 --> 44:27.960
 And so one of the,

44:29.840 --> 44:32.280
 Charlene who's my assistant is trying to do work

44:32.280 --> 44:36.400
 on helping people in prison with trauma,

44:36.400 --> 44:39.520
 potentially one day with MDMA or meditation or mindfulness.

44:39.520 --> 44:42.840
 But one of the exercises was teaching people to,

44:42.840 --> 44:45.020
 okay, here's how you deal with stress,

44:45.020 --> 44:46.800
 just close your eyes and deep breathe.

44:46.800 --> 44:49.400
 And what Charlene was saying is people don't close their eyes

44:49.400 --> 44:52.360
 in prison, you don't feel safe to do that.

44:52.360 --> 44:57.360
 So all that is just to say is that the context

44:57.840 --> 44:59.780
 is the most important factor.

44:59.780 --> 45:02.240
 So while I'll talk about the DMT experience,

45:02.240 --> 45:07.160
 the context was this supportive sense of safety

45:07.160 --> 45:09.120
 that I could be completely vulnerable

45:09.120 --> 45:12.920
 and out of any kind of controlled women,

45:12.920 --> 45:16.820
 I think often are less safe in this way than men

45:16.820 --> 45:18.520
 because of all the sexual assaults.

45:20.760 --> 45:25.760
 But what it can do by taking the ego orientation offline

45:26.920 --> 45:29.960
 to some extent, it opens you up to much more.

45:29.960 --> 45:32.620
 And to make a bigger point of that,

45:33.720 --> 45:35.920
 we could say that it's very similar

45:35.920 --> 45:38.060
 to the Copernican revolution.

45:38.060 --> 45:40.060
 And people thought that the earth

45:40.060 --> 45:41.720
 was the center of the universe

45:41.720 --> 45:46.380
 and the inquisition murdered people that questioned that.

45:47.240 --> 45:48.840
 Father Bruno burned at the stake.

45:48.840 --> 45:50.440
 Actually, one of the things he said,

45:50.440 --> 45:54.280
 I think that's worth all these years later saying

45:54.280 --> 45:58.880
 is that when the inquisition sentenced him

45:58.880 --> 46:02.040
 to burn at the stake for espousing this idea

46:02.040 --> 46:05.720
 that the earth was not really the center of the universe,

46:05.720 --> 46:08.400
 he said to the inquisition, he said,

46:08.400 --> 46:11.320
 your fear in sentencing me is greater

46:11.320 --> 46:13.620
 than my fear in being sentenced.

46:15.280 --> 46:18.120
 That their worldview was so rigid

46:18.120 --> 46:21.720
 that they had to wipe out anybody that would question it.

46:21.720 --> 46:26.720
 And so this idea of psychedelics displacing our ego

46:26.720 --> 46:28.640
 is the center of the universe.

46:28.640 --> 46:31.320
 And to realize that we are just rotating

46:31.320 --> 46:35.040
 about on something much bigger than our individual life.

46:35.040 --> 46:38.520
 Our ego is designed almost to protect this body

46:38.520 --> 46:40.280
 while we're alive.

46:40.280 --> 46:43.080
 And you can understand all the good reasons why that is,

46:44.040 --> 46:47.520
 but it also disconnects us from this bigger reality.

46:47.520 --> 46:49.080
 And so the psychedelics, DMT,

46:49.080 --> 46:52.480
 by knocking this sort of ego orientation

46:52.480 --> 46:55.640
 or the default mode network offline,

46:55.640 --> 47:00.600
 you open up to the bigger sweeps of history.

47:00.600 --> 47:03.560
 So in that place of safety and vulnerability

47:03.560 --> 47:06.000
 in that fascinating group of people,

47:06.000 --> 47:08.080
 when their ego was dissolved in this way,

47:08.080 --> 47:09.960
 did they have similar experiences?

47:09.960 --> 47:12.240
 Is there different places that their minds went?

47:12.240 --> 47:17.240
 Yeah, so once I had this kind of shattering experience

47:17.460 --> 47:19.640
 that Hitler's part of me,

47:19.640 --> 47:21.440
 no one else in the group had that.

47:21.440 --> 47:24.080
 Probably a lot of them have maybe had that before

47:24.080 --> 47:28.440
 or they realized that they're not just the good,

47:28.440 --> 47:31.520
 the white hat, good people and that they're all good

47:31.520 --> 47:34.560
 and we got to fight against the bad people.

47:35.360 --> 47:37.200
 So no, people will go in different places.

47:37.200 --> 47:39.360
 And not only that, if you do it again,

47:39.360 --> 47:40.480
 you'll go into a different place

47:40.480 --> 47:42.520
 than you went to the first time.

47:42.520 --> 47:45.000
 Unless you have not resolved the issue.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.520
 So I had a sequence of LSD trips that were very difficult,

47:48.520 --> 47:52.720
 but it was like coming to the same sort of conundrum,

47:52.720 --> 47:57.280
 the same challenge that I was unable to overcome.

47:57.280 --> 48:00.040
 This idea of letting go and really fully dissolving,

48:01.640 --> 48:02.980
 letting the ego fully go.

48:02.980 --> 48:04.840
 And I would have this sequence of trips

48:04.840 --> 48:07.320
 over a couple of months where I would reach this point

48:07.320 --> 48:08.800
 where I was too scared to move forward

48:08.800 --> 48:10.360
 and I would just be holding on.

48:11.880 --> 48:15.360
 So there are repeated themes sometimes.

48:15.360 --> 48:18.280
 What Stan Groff has said, which I find very beautiful,

48:18.280 --> 48:21.720
 is that the full expression of an emotion

48:21.720 --> 48:24.240
 is the funeral pyre of that emotion.

48:25.240 --> 48:29.200
 And what that means is if you can fully let in something,

48:29.200 --> 48:32.600
 then the essence of life has changed,

48:32.600 --> 48:35.640
 is that it moves on, that everything's in motion.

48:35.640 --> 48:37.320
 And if you can fully experience it,

48:37.320 --> 48:39.400
 even if it's a sense that you're gonna be trapped

48:39.400 --> 48:42.640
 in eternity in this hellish state,

48:42.640 --> 48:45.140
 if you surrender to that, that's the way out.

48:46.200 --> 48:48.160
 This full experience of something

48:48.160 --> 48:52.220
 is this funeral pyre of that emotion.

48:52.220 --> 48:54.720
 And so that runs against a lot

48:54.720 --> 48:56.320
 of what modern psychiatry is doing too,

48:56.320 --> 48:58.000
 which is to suppress symptoms.

49:00.360 --> 49:01.640
 Instead of supporting people

49:01.640 --> 49:03.920
 to kind of explore these insecurities

49:03.920 --> 49:06.300
 so that then they can contain them

49:06.300 --> 49:07.600
 and then they can move on.

49:09.080 --> 49:13.680
 So yeah, resistance is not a way to make progress.

49:13.680 --> 49:15.060
 Right, right.

49:15.060 --> 49:17.860
 Although one of the reasons

49:17.860 --> 49:21.380
 why we do the supplemental dose during the MDMA

49:21.380 --> 49:26.140
 or why there's advantages in a 10 hour LSD experience

49:26.140 --> 49:28.540
 is that you have a lot of opportunities

49:28.540 --> 49:31.060
 to come up against this resistance

49:31.060 --> 49:32.940
 that may be too difficult to deal with

49:32.940 --> 49:34.680
 and then you kind of push it aside

49:34.680 --> 49:36.580
 and then a couple hours later you come back to it

49:36.580 --> 49:37.580
 or you come back to it.

49:37.580 --> 49:40.500
 Press snooze every once in a while if you're not ready.

49:40.500 --> 49:41.460
 It's hard to do that.

49:41.460 --> 49:45.140
 I think with MDMA, you can negotiate.

49:45.140 --> 49:48.140
 That's, I think, a part of its safety in a sense.

49:48.140 --> 49:50.860
 You can have this like, oh, I should be talking about this

49:50.860 --> 49:53.740
 or I'm feeling this, but it's too much for me now.

49:53.740 --> 49:54.700
 You can push it away.

49:54.700 --> 49:57.080
 But with the classic psychedelics,

49:57.080 --> 49:59.500
 this kind of membrane between the conscious

49:59.500 --> 50:00.940
 and the unconscious,

50:00.940 --> 50:04.940
 that once you take the drug and it weakens this membrane

50:04.940 --> 50:06.100
 and things are coming up,

50:07.500 --> 50:10.660
 it's very difficult to negotiate with it.

50:10.660 --> 50:15.660
 The key to successful classic psychedelic trips is surrender.

50:18.100 --> 50:20.060
 You've talked about that you first began

50:20.060 --> 50:24.260
 to reconsider the negative health myths around psychedelics

50:24.260 --> 50:27.860
 when you learned that the book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

50:27.860 --> 50:30.580
 was written by Ken Kesey when he was in part

50:30.580 --> 50:32.640
 under the influence of LSD.

50:32.640 --> 50:36.180
 So how do you think LSD helped him, Ken Kesey,

50:36.180 --> 50:39.540
 in writing that incredible book?

50:39.540 --> 50:44.540
 Yeah, there's a process that's called semantic priming.

50:45.060 --> 50:49.380
 And so what that means is that I say night, you say day.

50:49.380 --> 50:52.420
 There's kind of normal patterns of kind of,

50:52.420 --> 50:56.660
 you say one word, what kind of words come to you next?

50:56.660 --> 50:58.500
 And so they've done some research.

50:58.500 --> 51:01.280
 They, meaning scientists, have done some research

51:01.280 --> 51:04.720
 where you give people a psychedelic

51:04.720 --> 51:07.420
 and then you do this semantic priming.

51:07.420 --> 51:12.060
 And what you find is they have a wider range of associations

51:12.060 --> 51:13.340
 than they normally would

51:13.340 --> 51:15.780
 when they're not under psychedelics.

51:15.780 --> 51:17.840
 So I think for Ken Kesey,

51:18.900 --> 51:21.980
 he was able with psychedelics to get

51:24.140 --> 51:26.400
 a deeper kind of emotional connection

51:26.400 --> 51:28.300
 to some of these states of mind

51:28.300 --> 51:30.740
 that people were in this mental institution

51:31.680 --> 51:35.580
 and that he could explore them more in depth

51:35.580 --> 51:37.420
 and more eloquently.

51:37.420 --> 51:40.080
 And also one of the things he talked about

51:40.080 --> 51:41.840
 was the fog machine,

51:41.840 --> 51:46.340
 was how people's minds were sort of clouded

51:46.340 --> 51:48.440
 by the people that ran the institution

51:48.440 --> 51:51.120
 and the fog machine would be coming in.

51:51.120 --> 51:56.120
 So I think the imagery and the metaphors

51:56.420 --> 51:58.580
 that he used a lot in the book

51:58.580 --> 52:00.980
 could come to him during LSD experiences.

52:00.980 --> 52:05.700
 And then now he wasn't doing very,

52:05.700 --> 52:10.500
 when you're writing, you have to be literate.

52:10.500 --> 52:12.520
 You have to be able to write.

52:13.420 --> 52:16.320
 So it would be more like beginning and ends of LSD trips

52:16.320 --> 52:17.740
 instead of at the peak.

52:17.740 --> 52:19.820
 But I think you would get a lot of these,

52:20.740 --> 52:23.240
 the feeling tones or the images, the metaphors,

52:23.240 --> 52:26.220
 I think he would get these extent,

52:26.220 --> 52:30.180
 also LSD lasts so long, you can get these extended focus

52:30.180 --> 52:34.060
 and you can really elaborate on images.

52:34.060 --> 52:37.860
 And so much of psychedelic experiences

52:37.860 --> 52:40.420
 are poetic and metaphorical.

52:40.420 --> 52:43.700
 I mean, you could take veterans

52:43.700 --> 52:48.580
 who've never read a book of poetry in their lives.

52:49.580 --> 52:52.020
 And under the influence of MDMA,

52:52.020 --> 52:54.260
 just what they describe, the imagery

52:54.260 --> 52:56.580
 and the way they describe their experiences,

52:56.580 --> 53:00.500
 metaphorical, poetic, it's incredible.

53:00.500 --> 53:05.500
 And so I think that Ken Kesey was able to channel

53:06.460 --> 53:09.660
 what LSD did to his mind in a way

53:09.660 --> 53:13.060
 that most people couldn't do,

53:13.060 --> 53:15.500
 that he did because he was trying to write this novel

53:15.500 --> 53:17.060
 and because he was so brilliant.

53:17.940 --> 53:22.940
 Yeah, I mean, we'll talk about psychedelics

53:22.940 --> 53:27.940
 and treating, in bringing some of trauma to the surface

53:28.300 --> 53:29.640
 and dealing with all those kinds of things,

53:29.640 --> 53:34.640
 but there's something also to the opening up of creativity

53:34.780 --> 53:37.380
 for whether it's for writing purposes

53:37.380 --> 53:41.940
 or for in my world for engineering, for invention,

53:41.940 --> 53:44.940
 innovation and invention itself is a very,

53:44.940 --> 53:47.300
 is a deeply creative process.

53:47.300 --> 53:52.300
 And it's fascinating to think with the aid of psychedelics,

53:53.660 --> 53:56.360
 what kind of ideas can be brought to life?

53:57.300 --> 53:59.060
 Yeah, well, we have the whole phenomena

53:59.060 --> 54:00.900
 of a lot of the people in Silicon Valley

54:00.900 --> 54:02.680
 and else microdosing psychedelics

54:02.680 --> 54:05.300
 in order to have a little touch more

54:05.300 --> 54:07.620
 of this creative approach to things.

54:07.620 --> 54:10.260
 I would love it to see if it was,

54:10.260 --> 54:12.460
 that's more like Terrence McKenna territory,

54:12.460 --> 54:13.460
 correct me if I'm wrong,

54:13.460 --> 54:16.100
 but I would love to sort of more scientific

54:16.100 --> 54:17.860
 to where there'll be the rigor

54:17.860 --> 54:21.220
 of saying how to do it effectively,

54:21.220 --> 54:26.220
 how to sort of understand sort of not just almost,

54:30.820 --> 54:35.020
 to take the full journey of creative exploration

54:35.020 --> 54:37.640
 and to do it for prolonged periods of time,

54:39.260 --> 54:43.140
 for years, lifelong kind of part of your life

54:43.140 --> 54:46.020
 of how it empowers creativity.

54:46.020 --> 54:51.020
 I think, of course, you start with helping people

54:53.340 --> 54:55.900
 deal with trauma, and then the next step

54:55.900 --> 55:00.620
 is people who have moved past their trauma

55:00.620 --> 55:02.300
 and are trying to do something,

55:02.300 --> 55:04.400
 create something special in their life.

55:04.400 --> 55:07.220
 How can then psychedelics empower that?

55:07.220 --> 55:08.700
 Yeah, now, that also,

55:08.700 --> 55:11.980
 just to not shy away from anything controversial,

55:11.980 --> 55:16.980
 that gets us to this idea of psychedelics for vision quest,

55:17.220 --> 55:19.420
 particularly for younger people.

55:19.420 --> 55:21.660
 You know, when you're sort of moving

55:21.660 --> 55:23.460
 into this adulting kind of phase

55:23.460 --> 55:24.500
 and you have to figure out

55:24.500 --> 55:26.300
 what are you gonna do with your life,

55:27.540 --> 55:29.780
 there's so many options.

55:29.780 --> 55:31.860
 A lot of people, of course, feel constrained

55:31.860 --> 55:33.280
 that they have very few options,

55:33.280 --> 55:36.660
 but I think this idea of psychedelics

55:36.660 --> 55:40.180
 as a way to help you find your calling

55:40.180 --> 55:44.240
 or find your vision or find your unique leverage point,

55:44.240 --> 55:45.580
 I think we'll see that more and more

55:45.580 --> 55:48.420
 as our culture evolves and gets healthier

55:48.420 --> 55:49.860
 around the use of psychedelics.

55:49.860 --> 55:52.420
 So it's both the science,

55:52.420 --> 55:55.020
 having the rigor of understanding how to do it safely

55:55.020 --> 55:56.740
 and the culture catching up

55:56.740 --> 56:01.740
 to the fact that this is both safe and very useful.

56:03.540 --> 56:07.580
 Yeah, although I would question this idea of safety.

56:07.580 --> 56:11.340
 So we can understand physiological risks

56:11.340 --> 56:13.100
 and we can minimize them.

56:13.100 --> 56:16.180
 And I think there's very minimal physiological risks

56:16.180 --> 56:18.460
 from the classic psychedelics, virtually none,

56:18.460 --> 56:22.640
 or for even MDMA under safe conditions.

56:23.740 --> 56:28.740
 Psychological risks are harder to address,

56:29.660 --> 56:32.980
 but we can do that through the sense of safety and support.

56:32.980 --> 56:37.520
 But I think there's a level of risk there

56:37.520 --> 56:39.820
 that we shouldn't overlook.

56:39.820 --> 56:42.700
 And so to make a drug into a medicine,

56:42.700 --> 56:45.200
 what we have to do is prove to the satisfaction

56:45.200 --> 56:47.740
 of the FDA and other regulatory agencies

56:47.740 --> 56:50.360
 that things are safe and efficacious.

56:50.360 --> 56:52.420
 But even though they use those words,

56:52.420 --> 56:55.820
 proving safety and safe and efficacious,

56:55.820 --> 56:57.940
 it's in relationship to the disease

56:57.940 --> 56:59.180
 that you're trying to treat

56:59.180 --> 57:01.760
 and you accept a certain amount of risk.

57:01.760 --> 57:06.760
 So it's the risk benefit ratio rather than pure safety.

57:06.760 --> 57:08.540
 Yeah, absolutely.

57:10.360 --> 57:13.560
 Let me ask you about Ken Kesey a little bit longer

57:13.560 --> 57:15.220
 because fascinating him being.

57:16.680 --> 57:19.760
 He was also part of Project MKUltra.

57:19.760 --> 57:21.320
 Yeah, yes.

57:21.320 --> 57:23.000
 What was Project MKUltra

57:23.000 --> 57:26.720
 and what lessons we should take away from it?

57:27.640 --> 57:32.640
 Well, MKUltra was a program by the CIA.

57:33.600 --> 57:35.600
 What they were looking at was,

57:35.600 --> 57:39.400
 can you take these drugs, these psychedelic drugs,

57:39.400 --> 57:42.120
 and weaponize them in different ways

57:43.120 --> 57:45.200
 for interrogation, for true serums,

57:45.200 --> 57:49.620
 for exposing somebody before they give a big talk

57:49.620 --> 57:52.460
 to something like LSD and then they can't talk

57:52.460 --> 57:53.680
 or make a fool of themselves?

57:53.680 --> 57:57.460
 Or can you spray LSD over the battlefield

57:57.460 --> 57:59.560
 and have everybody tripping and drop their weapons

57:59.560 --> 58:02.080
 and then you just walk up and nobody dies

58:02.080 --> 58:04.660
 and you've won the battle?

58:04.660 --> 58:07.240
 So it's a fascinating concept.

58:07.240 --> 58:09.800
 Yeah, they call it nonlethal incapacitance

58:09.800 --> 58:11.840
 and I think that's how it's.

58:11.840 --> 58:14.680
 One way to win a war is to enforce peace.

58:16.120 --> 58:19.040
 To get everybody not caring about the war, but yes.

58:19.040 --> 58:21.120
 Well, I think Gandhi said something even better,

58:21.120 --> 58:22.840
 which is that the true way to win a war

58:22.840 --> 58:24.520
 is to turn your enemy into your friend.

58:24.520 --> 58:26.520
 Yes, that's a beautiful way to put it.

58:26.520 --> 58:29.920
 Yeah, but MKUltra was really nefarious

58:29.920 --> 58:32.220
 and it was part of our military and it was done in secret

58:32.220 --> 58:36.600
 and they would dose people against their will.

58:36.600 --> 58:38.600
 I mean, one of the most infamous things

58:41.400 --> 58:44.560
 was that they had a house of prostitution in San Francisco

58:44.560 --> 58:47.800
 and they would have one way mirrors, all this stuff

58:47.800 --> 58:50.880
 and then they would just dose people with LSD

58:50.880 --> 58:53.960
 and they would have the prostitutes dose these guys with LSD

58:53.960 --> 58:56.120
 and observe what they would do and how they would act.

58:56.120 --> 58:58.840
 And the CIA actually for a while

58:58.840 --> 59:01.580
 was dosing each other secretly

59:01.580 --> 59:04.000
 and that there's a famous case of this fellow Olson

59:04.000 --> 59:08.640
 that either jumped out of a window or was pushed,

59:08.640 --> 59:10.560
 he might've been killed.

59:10.560 --> 59:13.880
 He was a CIA guy and they gave him LSD

59:13.880 --> 59:17.140
 and then they're trying to see can they break him down

59:17.140 --> 59:18.480
 and get him to tell secrets.

59:18.480 --> 59:21.000
 And I think he felt uncomfortable with what happened to him

59:21.000 --> 59:22.560
 while he was under the influence of LSD

59:22.560 --> 59:26.560
 and whether he was pushed or not,

59:26.560 --> 59:28.360
 I don't know if we'll ever know.

59:28.360 --> 59:33.360
 But MKUltra was violating people's human rights.

59:35.160 --> 59:40.160
 It was done in secret and the irony of it

59:41.720 --> 59:45.640
 is that Ken Kesey is one of the people,

59:45.640 --> 59:49.240
 one of the main early people that got LSD in this context

59:49.240 --> 59:51.520
 and then he was one of the main people

59:51.520 --> 59:54.380
 that helped inspire the hippies to use psychedelics

59:54.380 --> 59:56.160
 to oppose the Vietnam War.

59:56.160 --> 1:00:01.160
 So I think the CIA kind of in many cases,

1:00:01.520 --> 1:00:03.460
 things get out of their control,

1:00:03.460 --> 1:00:04.480
 what they think they can do

1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:08.580
 and it turned in to be a disaster for them.

1:00:08.580 --> 1:00:09.840
 I think there was some thought

1:00:09.840 --> 1:00:11.640
 that some of the people at the CIA had

1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:14.400
 is that if you can turn people inside,

1:00:14.400 --> 1:00:16.660
 take drugs and they just focus on their internal experience,

1:00:16.660 --> 1:00:18.680
 they're not gonna be involved politically.

1:00:18.680 --> 1:00:21.720
 It's a way to sort of take people offline.

1:00:21.720 --> 1:00:23.360
 And what I don't think they counted on

1:00:23.360 --> 1:00:24.600
 is that when you're offline

1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:27.720
 and you have these unit of special experiences

1:00:27.720 --> 1:00:29.520
 and you realize how we're all connected,

1:00:29.520 --> 1:00:32.780
 then why do you wanna go out and kill these Vietnamese

1:00:32.780 --> 1:00:37.780
 and put one dictator over another dictator,

1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:40.840
 dictators on both sides in North Vietnam and South Vietnam?

1:00:40.840 --> 1:00:42.760
 Why are we doing that?

1:00:42.760 --> 1:00:47.760
 So MKUltra has just a very disreputable.

1:00:48.480 --> 1:00:51.120
 We're learning more and more about what they did

1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:53.920
 and one of the unintended consequences was Ken Kesey

1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:56.320
 and not only that, but then the Grateful Dead

1:00:56.320 --> 1:01:00.160
 who began at the acid tests that Kesey was helping

1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:04.000
 to organize and out of that emerged,

1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:08.680
 you could say just this incredible psychedelic culture.

1:01:08.680 --> 1:01:12.720
 And you look at the bands that began in the 60s

1:01:12.720 --> 1:01:17.160
 and which ones have really survived to this day

1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:20.140
 and the Grateful Dead has survived longer

1:01:20.140 --> 1:01:22.300
 than most any other band.

1:01:22.300 --> 1:01:23.560
 I mean, some of them have died and all,

1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:25.220
 but it was like the tightness,

1:01:25.220 --> 1:01:27.600
 the sort of telepathy we talked about before

1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:31.240
 that they could just get so tuned in to each other

1:01:31.240 --> 1:01:34.080
 and each other's energies and they could do improvisations

1:01:34.080 --> 1:01:36.120
 and they can do this incredible work

1:01:36.120 --> 1:01:40.160
 that I think the sustainability of the Grateful Dead

1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:43.880
 as a group was a testament

1:01:43.880 --> 1:01:46.380
 to the power of the LSD experiences

1:01:46.380 --> 1:01:48.880
 and that might've never happened if not for MKUltra.

1:01:48.880 --> 1:01:53.880
 But can we talk about the darkness a little bit?

1:01:56.160 --> 1:01:59.800
 So Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber was allegedly part

1:01:59.800 --> 1:02:03.680
 of the MKUltra studies while at Harvard.

1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:05.160
 Do you think this is true?

1:02:05.160 --> 1:02:06.440
 Do you think it had an impact

1:02:06.440 --> 1:02:09.520
 on him psychologically, intellectually and so on?

1:02:09.520 --> 1:02:12.200
 I do think it's true and I do think it had an impact.

1:02:12.200 --> 1:02:16.320
 So we talked before about are these drugs somehow

1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:20.200
 or other producing a certain kind of drug experience

1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:23.040
 or do they bring out what's within?

1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:26.040
 So we have this experience, yeah, on the one hand,

1:02:26.040 --> 1:02:30.020
 Ken Kesey and he sort of took positive things out of this.

1:02:30.020 --> 1:02:35.020
 On the other hand, we can get this opposition

1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:38.400
 to the modern world, to technology

1:02:38.400 --> 1:02:42.180
 and to the point of creating bombs to try to go after it.

1:02:42.180 --> 1:02:45.360
 So that the experience is not in the drug,

1:02:45.360 --> 1:02:48.280
 it's this interaction between the drug,

1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:50.580
 the person, the context.

1:02:50.580 --> 1:02:55.580
 And so we can heal people with psychedelics

1:02:55.720 --> 1:02:58.500
 or people can be driven crazy with psychedelics.

1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:01.920
 It depends again on the context.

1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:05.360
 And so I think both these things can be true.

1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:06.560
 And I think it was really good

1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:08.120
 that you kind of highlighted this,

1:03:08.120 --> 1:03:13.040
 that there is this polarities and that it's not in the drug,

1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:17.200
 it's in the other factors and it's who they were beforehand

1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:19.000
 and then how you use that experience.

1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:22.240
 So all that's to say is if we put LSD in the water

1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:23.840
 and everybody were to get it,

1:03:23.840 --> 1:03:25.280
 it doesn't mean that all of a sudden

1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:27.000
 everybody's gonna have a mystical experience

1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.320
 and then that's all we need to do

1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:32.600
 and humanity is spiritualized or end war and all of this.

1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:35.520
 It's not about the drug.

1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:38.960
 And that actually is why for me,

1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:43.000
 we've also talked about engineering new psychedelics

1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:44.920
 and all the people that are gonna be trying

1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:48.040
 for profit companies to develop and patent new psychedelics.

1:03:48.040 --> 1:03:50.240
 For me, the most important challenge

1:03:50.240 --> 1:03:55.240
 is new cultural contexts that can create legality,

1:03:55.640 --> 1:03:59.320
 safety, support for the existing psychedelics

1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:00.960
 that we already have.

1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:04.480
 I mean, we have so much incredible tools

1:04:04.480 --> 1:04:06.320
 in these existing psychedelics

1:04:06.320 --> 1:04:09.840
 that it's more about creating context for them

1:04:09.840 --> 1:04:12.680
 to be used in safe medical or personal growth

1:04:12.680 --> 1:04:14.640
 or recreational even with harm reduction,

1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:15.480
 all these different ways.

1:04:15.480 --> 1:04:18.560
 That's more important to me than finding some new molecule

1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:20.520
 that's somewhat similar or somewhat different

1:04:20.520 --> 1:04:22.560
 but it can be patented.

1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:24.440
 So it's the social context.

1:04:24.440 --> 1:04:28.880
 So I do believe that Ted Kaczynski was part of NKUltra

1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:31.840
 and I think it affected him in a negative way

1:04:31.840 --> 1:04:36.120
 and that's a cautionary tale that it's not in the drug,

1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:37.520
 it's in the context.

1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:42.520
 The context, the person, still it feels like if viewed

1:04:44.680 --> 1:04:47.760
 from a therapy perspective, perhaps there was a way

1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:52.680
 to use psychedelics to help Ted Kaczynski find a path

1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:53.960
 out of the darkness.

1:04:53.960 --> 1:04:58.640
 I think so and I think that this is where I think MDMA

1:04:58.640 --> 1:05:03.640
 comes in in a way that MDMA is, he felt very isolated

1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:08.000
 and very much out of society in some ways.

1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:12.200
 MDMA stimulates oxytocin, which we haven't mentioned,

1:05:12.200 --> 1:05:14.080
 which is the hormone of nursing mothers,

1:05:14.080 --> 1:05:15.680
 of love and connection.

1:05:15.680 --> 1:05:18.800
 It provides a lot of this sense of self acceptance

1:05:18.800 --> 1:05:21.560
 and safety and wanting to be in a relationship.

1:05:21.560 --> 1:05:24.920
 There's Gould Dolan is a neuroscientist at Hopkins.

1:05:24.920 --> 1:05:29.920
 She's given octopuses MDMA, they're solitary creatures

1:05:30.080 --> 1:05:32.920
 except mating season, which is not very often

1:05:32.920 --> 1:05:35.240
 but you give them MDMA and they become more interested

1:05:35.240 --> 1:05:37.480
 in hanging out with other octopuses.

1:05:37.480 --> 1:05:40.960
 So I think this, for people that have had difficult

1:05:40.960 --> 1:05:45.200
 psychedelic experiences, MDMA helps them integrate them.

1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:48.640
 We've worked with people that had a difficult LSD experience

1:05:48.640 --> 1:05:52.240
 40 years before and are still able to get back to that

1:05:52.240 --> 1:05:54.480
 under the influence of MDMA and work out some

1:05:54.480 --> 1:05:57.400
 of the conflicts that they weren't able to resolve

1:05:58.680 --> 1:06:00.320
 all those decades before.

1:06:00.320 --> 1:06:04.720
 So I think that psychedelics could have been helpful

1:06:04.720 --> 1:06:07.720
 in a different context for Ted Kaczynski.

1:06:07.720 --> 1:06:11.840
 But the other big part of it is that people have to be

1:06:11.840 --> 1:06:14.200
 willing to cooperate with the experience.

1:06:14.200 --> 1:06:16.120
 We talked about resistance.

1:06:16.120 --> 1:06:18.000
 So people can resist these things.

1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:21.440
 It's the saying is you can bring a horse to water

1:06:21.440 --> 1:06:22.920
 but you can't make them drink.

1:06:22.920 --> 1:06:25.400
 This is about how people have to be willing

1:06:25.400 --> 1:06:26.920
 to go to these spaces.

1:06:26.920 --> 1:06:30.180
 So one of the essence of our therapeutic approach

1:06:30.180 --> 1:06:33.640
 is that we help people to heal themselves,

1:06:33.640 --> 1:06:36.560
 that we are not giving them the healing.

1:06:36.560 --> 1:06:40.800
 It's a flip on the power dynamics that existed,

1:06:41.680 --> 1:06:43.120
 you would say in the fifties and sixties,

1:06:43.120 --> 1:06:45.520
 my dad was a doctor and the doctors were gods

1:06:45.520 --> 1:06:47.600
 and whatever they said was right.

1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:50.180
 And we no longer, of course, believe that.

1:06:50.180 --> 1:06:54.400
 But for a while, psychoanalysis with Freud,

1:06:54.400 --> 1:06:56.920
 that they gave the interpretation to the patient.

1:06:56.920 --> 1:06:58.200
 The patient couldn't help themselves

1:06:58.200 --> 1:06:59.840
 but they would do the free associations

1:06:59.840 --> 1:07:02.280
 and the psychoanalyst would see these conflicts

1:07:02.280 --> 1:07:04.960
 and would be the one that does the healing,

1:07:04.960 --> 1:07:07.680
 would give this interpretation and that would open things up.

1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:11.000
 So I think it's this idea of empowering people

1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:12.860
 to heal themselves.

1:07:12.860 --> 1:07:16.600
 And so if Ted Kuznicki had been in a therapeutic setting

1:07:16.600 --> 1:07:19.800
 with psychedelics and if they'd had something

1:07:19.800 --> 1:07:23.760
 like MDMA available or MDA,

1:07:23.760 --> 1:07:25.520
 which was popular during the sixties,

1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:28.160
 which is a more like MDMA LSD combination,

1:07:28.160 --> 1:07:31.700
 the outcomes might've been different.

1:07:31.700 --> 1:07:34.340
 Let's take a step into the world of studies.

1:07:35.700 --> 1:07:38.660
 Timothy Leary, who was he

1:07:38.660 --> 1:07:41.500
 and what were the most important ideas

1:07:41.500 --> 1:07:43.460
 you've learned from him?

1:07:43.460 --> 1:07:48.300
 Well, I did have the opportunity to get to know him personally

1:07:48.300 --> 1:07:50.300
 and to spend some time with him.

1:07:50.300 --> 1:07:55.300
 Timothy Leary, well, let's start with Nixon saying

1:07:55.300 --> 1:07:58.640
 he's the most dangerous man in America.

1:07:58.640 --> 1:08:00.520
 That's a good place to start.

1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:01.720
 Yeah.

1:08:01.720 --> 1:08:03.360
 And why did Nixon say that?

1:08:03.360 --> 1:08:08.360
 It's because of this turn on, tune in, drop out.

1:08:11.640 --> 1:08:14.320
 Timothy Leary was just an incredible advocate

1:08:14.320 --> 1:08:18.800
 for think for yourself, question authority.

1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:19.960
 Those were the things he said all the time.

1:08:19.960 --> 1:08:21.480
 Think for yourself, question authority.

1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:23.080
 He was a rebel.

1:08:23.080 --> 1:08:25.440
 He was kicked out of West Point.

1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:30.440
 He was a psychologist who was at Harvard for three years

1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:32.600
 from 60 to 63.

1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:35.760
 Before he got to Harvard,

1:08:35.760 --> 1:08:39.760
 he had an experience with mushrooms in Mexico.

1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:44.840
 And he said he learned more in that experience

1:08:44.840 --> 1:08:47.320
 than he'd had in his entire academic career before then

1:08:47.320 --> 1:08:49.300
 about how the human mind works.

1:08:49.300 --> 1:08:53.480
 And so he came to Harvard wanting to do research

1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:54.620
 into psychedelics.

1:08:56.600 --> 1:09:01.200
 And he did some very important studies, both of which,

1:09:01.200 --> 1:09:03.520
 well, one was called the Good Friday Experiment,

1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:06.920
 which was whether psychedelics in religiously inclined

1:09:06.920 --> 1:09:09.860
 people taking psilocybin in a religious setting,

1:09:09.860 --> 1:09:12.060
 whether it could produce a mystical experience.

1:09:12.060 --> 1:09:15.140
 That took place at Marsh Chapel at the Boston University.

1:09:15.140 --> 1:09:18.000
 Because it's a little bit subjective,

1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:19.600
 where you can say entirely subjective,

1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:23.000
 what people describe happens to them.

1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:24.800
 He wanted to do another study,

1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:26.640
 which would be a more objective measure,

1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:28.640
 and that was called the Concord Prison Experiment.

1:09:28.640 --> 1:09:30.880
 And that was the thought, if you can give people

1:09:32.280 --> 1:09:35.740
 psilocybin mystical sense of connection type experiences

1:09:35.740 --> 1:09:38.000
 while they're in prison, when they get out,

1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:41.120
 they'll be more pro social and they'll have reduced

1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:41.960
 recidivism.

1:09:43.340 --> 1:09:44.440
 So Tim did that.

1:09:44.440 --> 1:09:46.560
 He also did the naturalistic studies

1:09:46.560 --> 1:09:48.140
 of giving loads of people psilocybin

1:09:48.140 --> 1:09:50.500
 and sort of writing down what their experiences were,

1:09:50.500 --> 1:09:52.400
 the range of experiences.

1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:56.720
 Later on in his time at Harvard,

1:09:56.720 --> 1:09:58.900
 they started doing LSD.

1:09:58.900 --> 1:10:02.280
 And LSD is more cerebral, longer lasting,

1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:04.920
 not as reassuring in a way as psilocybin.

1:10:04.920 --> 1:10:08.680
 Sometimes he used to say that if they never got into LSD,

1:10:08.680 --> 1:10:12.480
 they'd still be at Harvard with the psilocybin.

1:10:12.480 --> 1:10:14.820
 So he was a great American psychologist,

1:10:14.820 --> 1:10:19.680
 but then he got tired of the psychology game,

1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:22.040
 you could say, or he would say that.

1:10:22.040 --> 1:10:27.040
 He got more and more interested in cultural change

1:10:27.700 --> 1:10:30.640
 and various musicians and artists

1:10:30.640 --> 1:10:32.160
 and all sorts of people started coming to him

1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:34.720
 for the psychedelic experience that they are in a way

1:10:34.720 --> 1:10:36.240
 for creativity, for other things.

1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:40.680
 So he started hanging out with all sorts of famous people

1:10:40.680 --> 1:10:45.680
 or creative people and he stopped going to classes a lot.

1:10:47.200 --> 1:10:52.200
 And Ram Dass, Richard Alpert had given LSD to a student

1:10:54.920 --> 1:10:59.640
 that Ram Dass was courageous enough to admit

1:10:59.640 --> 1:11:02.560
 that he had a sexual interest in.

1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:04.440
 They weren't supposed to give it undergraduates.

1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:06.320
 That was about the only time that they ever did it.

1:11:06.320 --> 1:11:09.980
 And psychedelics just getting more and more controversial

1:11:09.980 --> 1:11:13.320
 even in the early 60s, eventually got kicked out of Harvard

1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:16.280
 and then he became kind of a cultural icon

1:11:16.280 --> 1:11:21.280
 for the counterculture and was hounded by the police

1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:24.880
 and Nixon and spent a lot of time in jail.

1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:26.780
 I mean, he's an incredible person.

1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:33.160
 One thing that Ram Dass said is that Richard Alpert,

1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:37.280
 Ram Dass said, I'm a rascal, but Leary's a scoundrel.

1:11:37.280 --> 1:11:39.880
 What's the distinction?

1:11:39.880 --> 1:11:41.560
 Rascals like in good fun.

1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:45.260
 A scoundrel is like, you can't quite trust them, I think.

1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:48.200
 I think that.

1:11:48.200 --> 1:11:50.040
 It's a spectrum of sorts.

1:11:50.040 --> 1:11:52.120
 Yeah, I think that Leary was someone

1:11:52.120 --> 1:11:55.560
 who a little bit got addicted to media attention.

1:11:57.160 --> 1:12:01.280
 But I think that overall he gets blamed a lot

1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:04.000
 for the backlash against the 60s,

1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:05.680
 the shutdown of psychedelic research.

1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:08.740
 I think that he is unfairly blamed for a lot of that.

1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:12.400
 I think when you look back at the 60s,

1:12:13.480 --> 1:12:15.800
 the common narrative is that it was

1:12:15.800 --> 1:12:17.760
 because psychedelics going wrong.

1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:19.580
 People took psychedelics, they weren't prepared,

1:12:19.580 --> 1:12:21.780
 they had emotional breakdowns, they weren't psychotic,

1:12:21.780 --> 1:12:24.280
 they killed themselves, they did this or that,

1:12:24.280 --> 1:12:27.120
 different problems of people taking psychedelics

1:12:27.120 --> 1:12:31.540
 in context that they didn't feel fairly safe in

1:12:31.540 --> 1:12:33.020
 or just they weren't prepared

1:12:33.020 --> 1:12:34.480
 or they didn't know how much they were taking

1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:35.320
 or all this.

1:12:35.320 --> 1:12:39.440
 So the backlash was because psychedelics going wrong.

1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:42.680
 But I think the real reason, while that did happen,

1:12:42.680 --> 1:12:45.560
 I think the real reason is psychedelics going right

1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:48.160
 and people having this sense of connection.

1:12:48.160 --> 1:12:50.960
 And then the opposite of what the CIA was hoping

1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:54.240
 that it would kind of turn people inward

1:12:54.240 --> 1:12:56.320
 and take them away from political struggles,

1:12:56.320 --> 1:12:58.960
 it actually motivated people.

1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:02.200
 Once you actually have these psychedelic experiences,

1:13:02.200 --> 1:13:05.040
 your attitude towards death changes also

1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:09.080
 this idea of death becoming an intrinsic part of life,

1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:12.160
 it's a natural cycle, it's not so much.

1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:15.560
 So I think people realize that,

1:13:15.560 --> 1:13:18.840
 while there's this billions of years of evolution,

1:13:18.840 --> 1:13:21.420
 infinity, whatever that means in terms of time,

1:13:21.420 --> 1:13:22.920
 that we're here for a very limited time

1:13:22.920 --> 1:13:24.800
 and they end up wanting to use their time well,

1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:26.720
 they have a lessened fear of death

1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:29.800
 and they wanna build this paradise on earth here now

1:13:29.800 --> 1:13:31.200
 instead of later.

1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:35.200
 So a lot of people really did get motivated

1:13:35.200 --> 1:13:36.880
 to challenge the Vietnam War,

1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:38.440
 to work on the environmental movement,

1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:40.560
 civil rights movement, women's rights movement,

1:13:40.560 --> 1:13:42.320
 anti militarism.

1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:44.640
 And it was that challenge to the status quo

1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:46.360
 that caused the backlash.

1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:50.540
 So Leary is someone who in 1990,

1:13:50.540 --> 1:13:52.960
 we had the maps I started in 86.

1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:56.040
 So in 1990, we had this conference

1:13:56.040 --> 1:13:57.760
 to raise money out in California

1:13:57.760 --> 1:13:59.600
 and Leary was there and Ram Dass was there

1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:01.760
 and Ralph Metzner was there and Andy Weil was there

1:14:01.760 --> 1:14:02.840
 and Terrence McKenna was there

1:14:02.840 --> 1:14:04.800
 and Dennis McKenna was there and all these.

1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:09.800
 But there was one point where Tim was speaking

1:14:09.800 --> 1:14:11.920
 and afterwards I was asking him some questions.

1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:15.240
 And I said, do you have any advice for us

1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:17.120
 on how to work with the government

1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:19.600
 and how to bring these psychedelics forward?

1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:20.760
 That's what we're trying to do.

1:14:20.760 --> 1:14:22.720
 I've got this nonprofit for it.

1:14:22.720 --> 1:14:23.980
 We're trying to do this research.

1:14:23.980 --> 1:14:27.080
 What is your advice on how to bring this forward

1:14:27.080 --> 1:14:29.280
 and how to work with the government?

1:14:29.280 --> 1:14:31.920
 And he said, fuck the government.

1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:36.440
 He said, I am so far past asking for permission

1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:40.720
 for anything, but I'm glad that you're doing it.

1:14:40.720 --> 1:14:44.040
 And then he held up my hand like passing the torch.

1:14:44.040 --> 1:14:47.400
 So it was, and that's one of my favorite photographs

1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:48.880
 of me and Tim where he's sort of like,

1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:50.680
 but it was after this, fuck the government.

1:14:50.680 --> 1:14:53.160
 I'm so far past asking for permission for anything,

1:14:53.160 --> 1:14:54.840
 but I'm glad that you are.

1:14:54.840 --> 1:14:57.760
 Now I did follow ups to the Good Friday experiment

1:14:57.760 --> 1:14:59.880
 and I did follow ups, 25 year follow up

1:14:59.880 --> 1:15:01.040
 to the Good Friday experiment,

1:15:01.040 --> 1:15:02.420
 about a 34 year follow up

1:15:02.420 --> 1:15:04.240
 to the Concord Prison experiment.

1:15:05.880 --> 1:15:08.200
 What I discovered in some ways I would say

1:15:08.200 --> 1:15:10.400
 is the key to the 60s, what I just told you,

1:15:10.400 --> 1:15:12.820
 but in the follow up to the Good Friday experiment

1:15:12.820 --> 1:15:16.100
 that I did in the 80s for my undergraduate thesis

1:15:16.100 --> 1:15:18.640
 at New College in Sarasota, Florida,

1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:21.040
 I eventually found 19 out of the 20 people.

1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:23.620
 It was just, that was an enormous challenge

1:15:23.620 --> 1:15:24.960
 because their names were all lost

1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:27.320
 and it just took forever years and years and years

1:15:27.320 --> 1:15:28.160
 to find them all.

1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:30.640
 But I discovered that those people

1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:32.200
 that had the psilocybin experience

1:15:32.200 --> 1:15:35.900
 in the midst of 25 years later with Nancy Reagan

1:15:35.900 --> 1:15:38.260
 and Ronald Reagan, and if there ever were there

1:15:38.260 --> 1:15:41.160
 a social pressure to disavow the validity

1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:43.960
 of the psychedelic experience, that was then.

1:15:43.960 --> 1:15:47.120
 And instead they affirmed it,

1:15:47.120 --> 1:15:51.120
 that they thought with all of this years of hindsight,

1:15:51.120 --> 1:15:52.380
 now looking back, they thought it was

1:15:52.380 --> 1:15:53.920
 a valid mystical experience.

1:15:53.920 --> 1:15:57.840
 But I discovered that one of the persons

1:15:59.240 --> 1:16:03.680
 who had the psilocybin had this experience

1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:05.680
 during the Good Friday service

1:16:05.680 --> 1:16:09.080
 that Reverend Howard Thurman was the minister.

1:16:09.080 --> 1:16:11.040
 He was Martin Luther King's mentor

1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:12.800
 and Reverend Howard Thurman was the minister

1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:15.300
 at Boston at Marsh Chapel.

1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:20.480
 Martin Luther King got his PhD at Boston University.

1:16:20.480 --> 1:16:24.320
 And Howard Thurman had spent time with Gandhi.

1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:26.820
 And so he was really kind of this hidden person

1:16:26.820 --> 1:16:28.260
 behind the civil rights movement

1:16:28.260 --> 1:16:31.120
 about nonviolence as their strategy.

1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:33.600
 But he was interested in the political implications

1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:34.540
 of the mystical experience.

1:16:34.540 --> 1:16:37.600
 So he permitted this experiment to take place.

1:16:37.600 --> 1:16:39.520
 And there were 20 divinity students

1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:41.180
 from Andover Newton in the basement

1:16:41.180 --> 1:16:44.060
 and 10 experimenters, all the people on religion

1:16:44.060 --> 1:16:47.840
 and psychology, like Houston Smith and Walter Huston Clarke

1:16:47.840 --> 1:16:50.520
 and Leary and Ramdas, Mr. Others were there

1:16:50.520 --> 1:16:51.980
 as a support part of it.

1:16:51.980 --> 1:16:54.520
 And the sermon was like three hours later.

1:16:54.520 --> 1:16:56.440
 We actually have, three hours long,

1:16:56.440 --> 1:16:58.560
 we actually have the original sermon

1:16:58.560 --> 1:16:59.880
 from the Good Friday experiment

1:16:59.880 --> 1:17:02.240
 from Howard Thurman up on our website.

1:17:02.240 --> 1:17:03.320
 It's incredible.

1:17:03.320 --> 1:17:06.280
 But part of it was tell people there's a man on the cross.

1:17:06.280 --> 1:17:09.280
 And this one person sort of heard that

1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:11.240
 and he thought, okay, I gotta do that.

1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:14.160
 Howard Thurman was such a dynamic speaker.

1:17:14.160 --> 1:17:16.780
 He said, I gotta tell people there's a man on the cross.

1:17:16.780 --> 1:17:18.180
 And so he said, what am I doing here

1:17:18.180 --> 1:17:20.720
 in this basement chapel listening to this service?

1:17:20.720 --> 1:17:22.200
 I gotta go tell people there's a man on the cross.

1:17:22.200 --> 1:17:24.540
 So he went, they thought he was just going to the bathroom,

1:17:24.540 --> 1:17:25.380
 but he ran out the door.

1:17:25.380 --> 1:17:27.480
 He's running down Commonwealth Avenue

1:17:27.480 --> 1:17:31.440
 and Houston Smith and Tim Leary go after him.

1:17:31.440 --> 1:17:34.560
 And he had thought that since he should tell somebody,

1:17:34.560 --> 1:17:38.320
 he should tell the president, like why not?

1:17:38.320 --> 1:17:40.380
 But then he realized, well, the president's in Washington.

1:17:40.380 --> 1:17:42.400
 I'm here in Boston.

1:17:42.400 --> 1:17:44.320
 I'll just tell the president of the university.

1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:46.120
 So anyway, he's running down the street

1:17:46.120 --> 1:17:48.800
 and Leary and Houston Smith go after him.

1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:50.120
 And he doesn't want to go back inside.

1:17:50.120 --> 1:17:50.960
 They finally get him.

1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:51.860
 He's not hit by a car,

1:17:53.560 --> 1:17:55.960
 but they end up giving him a shot of Thorazine.

1:17:57.280 --> 1:17:58.200
 What's Thorazine?

1:17:58.200 --> 1:18:02.240
 Thorazine is like a major antipsychotic drug.

1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:07.020
 It's a horrible drug, but it knocks people out,

1:18:07.020 --> 1:18:08.680
 tranquilizes them.

1:18:08.680 --> 1:18:10.120
 We would never do that today.

1:18:11.060 --> 1:18:14.280
 We don't abort a difficult experience like that.

1:18:14.280 --> 1:18:15.620
 But in any case, they hid that.

1:18:15.620 --> 1:18:20.040
 That was not part of the writeup of this experiment.

1:18:20.040 --> 1:18:22.320
 So what they did is in a sense,

1:18:22.320 --> 1:18:24.640
 a little bit exaggerated the benefits.

1:18:24.640 --> 1:18:27.340
 It later became out three years later after the experiment

1:18:27.340 --> 1:18:28.680
 or four years in Time Magazine,

1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:30.400
 it said everybody that got psilocybin

1:18:30.400 --> 1:18:32.400
 had a mystical experience.

1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:34.060
 Say it wasn't true, not everybody.

1:18:34.060 --> 1:18:37.520
 Eight out of the 10 did, but not all 10, not this guy.

1:18:37.520 --> 1:18:40.960
 And they minimize the risks.

1:18:40.960 --> 1:18:41.960
 So there was a bit of that.

1:18:41.960 --> 1:18:43.960
 I think Tim was reckless in that way.

1:18:43.960 --> 1:18:48.440
 It was underplayed the risks and overpromised the benefits.

1:18:48.440 --> 1:18:51.240
 And then the Concord Prison experiment,

1:18:51.240 --> 1:18:56.000
 it turned out that Tim had fudged the data completely

1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:57.920
 and it wasn't really successful.

1:18:57.920 --> 1:19:00.360
 So I fault him for that.

1:19:00.360 --> 1:19:02.320
 The outside world was doing the opposite.

1:19:02.320 --> 1:19:06.160
 It was exaggerating the risks and blocking research.

1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:09.360
 So he felt justified to fudge the data

1:19:09.360 --> 1:19:12.280
 because the outside world was fudging in a sense,

1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:13.920
 the response to the.

1:19:13.920 --> 1:19:15.280
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:20.280
 Yeah, so that presents a very nice context.

1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:24.600
 Fuck the government, but I'm glad that somebody

1:19:26.200 --> 1:19:28.520
 is fighting the good fight from within

1:19:28.520 --> 1:19:32.920
 and doing it the right way, which is where you are.

1:19:32.920 --> 1:19:37.920
 So the 80s, let me ask, what is MAPS,

1:19:38.200 --> 1:19:42.000
 the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies

1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:45.240
 and what is its mission throughout the years,

1:19:45.240 --> 1:19:46.360
 throughout the decades?

1:19:46.360 --> 1:19:49.960
 Yeah, so MAPS is a nonprofit organization.

1:19:49.960 --> 1:19:52.980
 I created it as a nonprofit pharmaceutical company.

1:19:53.920 --> 1:19:57.180
 I created it in 86 after DEA,

1:19:57.180 --> 1:19:58.760
 the Drug Enforcement Administration,

1:19:58.760 --> 1:20:01.560
 criminalized MDMA in 1985.

1:20:01.560 --> 1:20:05.800
 And that was after they started trying to do that in 1984.

1:20:05.800 --> 1:20:09.640
 And as I mentioned, this Terence McKenna is sponsoring,

1:20:09.640 --> 1:20:12.280
 motivating us to do this safety study.

1:20:12.280 --> 1:20:15.440
 So we did that in preparation for this eventual crackdown

1:20:15.440 --> 1:20:18.960
 because MDMA was called Adam, used as a therapy drug,

1:20:18.960 --> 1:20:21.760
 but it was also beginning to be sold as ecstasy

1:20:21.760 --> 1:20:22.600
 as a party drug.

1:20:22.600 --> 1:20:25.560
 And that was taking place in public settings and bars.

1:20:25.560 --> 1:20:29.000
 And so it was inevitable that the crackdown would happen.

1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:32.760
 And so I had a nonprofit connected to Buckminster Fuller,

1:20:32.760 --> 1:20:35.100
 Earth Metabolic Design Lab,

1:20:35.100 --> 1:20:38.680
 that we used to support this lawsuit against the DEA

1:20:38.680 --> 1:20:41.160
 to block them from criminalizing MDMA.

1:20:41.160 --> 1:20:43.520
 We were winning in the court of public opinion

1:20:43.520 --> 1:20:45.120
 and winning in the court.

1:20:45.120 --> 1:20:46.280
 The DEA freaked out

1:20:46.280 --> 1:20:49.680
 and the emergency scheduled MDMA in 85.

1:20:49.680 --> 1:20:51.040
 The handwriting was on the wall

1:20:51.040 --> 1:20:52.520
 that they were not gonna permit

1:20:52.520 --> 1:20:54.280
 the therapeutic use to continue

1:20:54.280 --> 1:20:56.480
 because it gets in the way of the narrative of the drug war

1:20:56.480 --> 1:20:58.320
 and these are terrible drugs.

1:20:58.320 --> 1:21:02.760
 So in 86 is when I started MAPS as a nonprofit pharma

1:21:02.760 --> 1:21:05.600
 because the strategy that I realized is that

1:21:05.600 --> 1:21:09.540
 Americans are open to medicines,

1:21:10.420 --> 1:21:13.100
 that tools to ease suffering,

1:21:13.100 --> 1:21:14.540
 that was the opening wedge,

1:21:14.540 --> 1:21:17.300
 the opening door to changing attitudes.

1:21:17.300 --> 1:21:18.740
 And it would be through science.

1:21:18.740 --> 1:21:21.700
 I would say that my religion is more science

1:21:21.700 --> 1:21:23.260
 than anything else.

1:21:23.260 --> 1:21:28.260
 And culture and religion are metaphorical,

1:21:28.400 --> 1:21:31.040
 but often too much they become literal.

1:21:31.040 --> 1:21:34.400
 But I felt that through science, through medicine,

1:21:34.400 --> 1:21:36.820
 there would be a way to bring these drugs

1:21:36.820 --> 1:21:37.900
 back to the surface.

1:21:37.900 --> 1:21:42.340
 And the mission was always this mass mental health,

1:21:42.340 --> 1:21:46.660
 this idea that what we need is to spiritualize humanity.

1:21:46.660 --> 1:21:49.180
 Einstein said the splitting of the atom

1:21:49.180 --> 1:21:52.240
 has changed everything except our mode of thinking.

1:21:52.240 --> 1:21:56.220
 And hence we drift towards unparalleled catastrophe,

1:21:56.220 --> 1:21:59.300
 which shall be required if mankind is to survive

1:21:59.300 --> 1:22:01.180
 is a whole new mode of thinking.

1:22:01.180 --> 1:22:04.420
 So what is that new mode of thinking?

1:22:05.560 --> 1:22:10.560
 My presumption is that it's more of this mystical sense

1:22:10.720 --> 1:22:12.920
 of thinking that we're all connected.

1:22:12.920 --> 1:22:14.800
 And then if we realize that we're all connected,

1:22:14.800 --> 1:22:16.360
 we're not gonna blow up the world.

1:22:16.360 --> 1:22:20.080
 So a lot of people say that if we could just give LSD

1:22:20.080 --> 1:22:22.920
 all to the world leaders, that would be,

1:22:22.920 --> 1:22:24.520
 then they'd have these spiritual experiences,

1:22:24.520 --> 1:22:25.360
 the world would be better.

1:22:25.360 --> 1:22:27.200
 But I actually had a ketamine experience

1:22:27.200 --> 1:22:29.600
 the day after that DMT experience I described

1:22:29.600 --> 1:22:31.480
 with the inner Hitler.

1:22:31.480 --> 1:22:34.520
 This ketamine experience was,

1:22:34.520 --> 1:22:37.280
 I was above and behind Hitler as he was giving a speech,

1:22:37.280 --> 1:22:40.220
 like the Nuremberg rallies kind of thing.

1:22:40.220 --> 1:22:42.280
 And I was trying to think, how do I get into his head?

1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:44.560
 How do I undo what he wants to do?

1:22:44.560 --> 1:22:46.280
 How can we deal with him?

1:22:46.280 --> 1:22:48.960
 And I realized this whole new thing

1:22:48.960 --> 1:22:50.520
 about the Heil Hitler salute.

1:22:50.520 --> 1:22:53.240
 And he would like push energy out

1:22:53.240 --> 1:22:55.600
 and then everybody would do the salute back to him.

1:22:55.600 --> 1:22:57.180
 And so it's like the one to the many

1:22:57.180 --> 1:22:58.020
 and the many to the one,

1:22:58.020 --> 1:23:00.040
 giving all these people giving away their power

1:23:00.040 --> 1:23:03.240
 and then how it would just sort of ratchet up in intensity

1:23:03.240 --> 1:23:04.960
 like these vibrations.

1:23:04.960 --> 1:23:07.480
 And I realized there's no way to get into his head.

1:23:07.480 --> 1:23:08.800
 This idea we've talked about before

1:23:08.800 --> 1:23:10.980
 about you have to be willing.

1:23:10.980 --> 1:23:13.680
 So what that sort of helped me understand

1:23:13.680 --> 1:23:16.800
 is that the strategy has to be mass mental health.

1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:18.540
 It's not about changing a few leaders.

1:23:18.540 --> 1:23:21.280
 We need to change the mass of humanity

1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:24.280
 to this new mode of thinking, this new spiritual way.

1:23:24.280 --> 1:23:28.680
 So MAPS was a nonprofit pharmaceutical company

1:23:28.680 --> 1:23:30.600
 focused on psychedelics.

1:23:30.600 --> 1:23:32.120
 Big Pharma wasn't doing this work.

1:23:32.120 --> 1:23:33.920
 Government wasn't funding it.

1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:35.160
 So the only source of funds

1:23:35.160 --> 1:23:37.200
 I thought would be through nonprofit donations.

1:23:37.200 --> 1:23:39.160
 And that's been true up until just a couple of years ago

1:23:39.160 --> 1:23:41.440
 now that we have the rise of these for profits.

1:23:41.440 --> 1:23:42.560
 But that's because we've cleared out

1:23:42.560 --> 1:23:45.000
 the regulatory obstacles.

1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:47.600
 We've got more scientific data about the benefits

1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:49.320
 funded through philanthropy.

1:23:49.320 --> 1:23:51.240
 We've changed public opinion

1:23:51.240 --> 1:23:53.840
 and there's a lot less zeal for the drug war.

1:23:53.840 --> 1:23:55.280
 So all of those things have changed.

1:23:55.280 --> 1:23:58.960
 But at the time it was mass mental health was the goal.

1:23:58.960 --> 1:24:01.600
 Two tracks, one was drug development,

1:24:01.600 --> 1:24:03.800
 the other was drug policy reform.

1:24:03.800 --> 1:24:05.960
 So then it's not just available to people

1:24:05.960 --> 1:24:07.360
 that have a clinical diagnosis,

1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:10.560
 but people who are personal growth

1:24:10.560 --> 1:24:13.960
 or they should have access to it as well.

1:24:13.960 --> 1:24:16.560
 I did not know at the time that no drug

1:24:16.560 --> 1:24:19.200
 had ever been made into a medicine by a nonprofit.

1:24:20.480 --> 1:24:23.160
 That was really good I didn't know that.

1:24:23.160 --> 1:24:26.040
 I might've been a little bit more daunted.

1:24:26.040 --> 1:24:28.440
 And actually that didn't happen for 13 more years.

1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:30.600
 It happened in 1999.

1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:34.200
 And that was the abortion pill, RU46,

1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:36.760
 that was approved in Europe, but it's controversial.

1:24:36.760 --> 1:24:39.400
 Nobody, no pharmaceutical company would take it.

1:24:39.400 --> 1:24:41.480
 And it was John D. Rockefeller the third

1:24:41.480 --> 1:24:42.760
 through the population council

1:24:42.760 --> 1:24:45.600
 with the major donor being Warren Buffet.

1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:48.560
 And the Rockefellers and the Buffets

1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:51.360
 and some of the Pritzkers were involved in funding this.

1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:54.160
 So that was the first nonprofit.

1:24:54.160 --> 1:24:59.160
 But the MAPS was designed as from the very beginning,

1:25:00.600 --> 1:25:03.440
 not academic research into psychedelics,

1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:04.640
 but drug development.

1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:06.360
 And that's a fundamental distinction.

1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:08.600
 And that's why I think we're years ahead now

1:25:08.600 --> 1:25:11.120
 with everybody else in terms of making

1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:13.780
 a psychedelic assisted therapy into a medicine.

1:25:13.780 --> 1:25:16.840
 Because our goal from the very beginning was not knowledge,

1:25:16.840 --> 1:25:19.040
 not academic research, it was practical.

1:25:19.040 --> 1:25:20.080
 It was drug development.

1:25:20.080 --> 1:25:22.440
 How do we create new social structures?

1:25:22.440 --> 1:25:25.120
 How do we create legal access to these things?

1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:28.400
 Now, in December of 2014,

1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:31.880
 we created the MAPS Public Benefit Corporation.

1:25:31.880 --> 1:25:36.680
 So MAPS is a nonprofit, but in our 35 years,

1:25:36.680 --> 1:25:39.720
 we've raised about $110 million in donations.

1:25:41.600 --> 1:25:43.800
 What I didn't know when I started MAPS,

1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:46.520
 and it took me quite a few years,

1:25:46.520 --> 1:25:50.440
 I didn't even know this till about eight, nine years ago,

1:25:50.440 --> 1:25:54.840
 was that in 1984, Ronald Reagan had signed a bill

1:25:54.840 --> 1:25:57.140
 to create incentives for developing drugs

1:25:57.140 --> 1:25:58.840
 that were off patent.

1:25:58.840 --> 1:26:02.040
 So MDMA was invented by Merck in 1912.

1:26:02.040 --> 1:26:03.720
 It's in the public domain.

1:26:03.720 --> 1:26:06.320
 These incentives are called data exclusivity,

1:26:06.320 --> 1:26:08.360
 which means that if you make a drug into a medicine

1:26:08.360 --> 1:26:10.260
 that has no patent protection,

1:26:10.260 --> 1:26:13.440
 nobody can use your data for a period of time

1:26:13.440 --> 1:26:14.660
 to market a generic.

1:26:14.660 --> 1:26:16.520
 And that will effectively be,

1:26:16.520 --> 1:26:18.880
 well, it's five years, you do pediatric studies,

1:26:18.880 --> 1:26:20.520
 you get six months extension,

1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:24.120
 and we are being required, if we succeed in adults,

1:26:24.120 --> 1:26:26.520
 to work with adolescents with PTSD.

1:26:26.520 --> 1:26:28.140
 It blocks a generic competitor

1:26:28.140 --> 1:26:30.840
 from applying till that five and a half years is over,

1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:33.140
 takes FDA at least six months to review.

1:26:33.140 --> 1:26:35.940
 So more or less six years of data exclusivity,

1:26:35.940 --> 1:26:38.820
 10 years in Europe is data exclusivity.

1:26:38.820 --> 1:26:42.300
 So the story then became to the donors

1:26:42.300 --> 1:26:45.240
 that you're not gonna have to give us money forever

1:26:45.240 --> 1:26:48.300
 because we can make money selling MDMA,

1:26:48.300 --> 1:26:51.700
 but we wanna do two revolutionary things, you could say.

1:26:51.700 --> 1:26:53.800
 One is psychedelic assisted psychotherapy,

1:26:53.800 --> 1:26:56.440
 but the other is marketing drugs.

1:26:56.440 --> 1:26:59.740
 When you market it with the profit maximization motive,

1:26:59.740 --> 1:27:02.480
 we end up in the extreme getting the distortions

1:27:02.480 --> 1:27:03.520
 that we have in America,

1:27:03.520 --> 1:27:06.720
 where we have the most expensive healthcare system

1:27:06.720 --> 1:27:07.840
 in the world per capita,

1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:11.000
 but our outcomes are down like 40 or 50 among the countries,

1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:11.880
 our average outcomes.

1:27:11.880 --> 1:27:13.900
 We don't have, third of the people or so

1:27:13.900 --> 1:27:17.360
 don't have insurance, and it's just very inequitable.

1:27:17.360 --> 1:27:19.440
 So what we're trying to do

1:27:19.440 --> 1:27:22.640
 is show a different way to market drugs.

1:27:22.640 --> 1:27:24.560
 And it's a modification of capitalism

1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:26.640
 that's called the benefit corporation,

1:27:26.640 --> 1:27:29.560
 where you maximize public benefit, not profit.

1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:31.320
 You still make a profit.

1:27:31.320 --> 1:27:33.420
 So selling MDMA for a profit

1:27:33.420 --> 1:27:36.560
 is not something we could keep inside the nonprofit

1:27:36.560 --> 1:27:39.480
 because it's taxable, it's a business.

1:27:39.480 --> 1:27:42.740
 So we've created the MAPS Public Benefit Corporation,

1:27:42.740 --> 1:27:45.120
 which is 100% owned by the nonprofit.

1:27:45.120 --> 1:27:48.120
 So we have a nonprofit that owns a pharma company.

1:27:49.520 --> 1:27:51.240
 And the mission of that pharma company

1:27:51.240 --> 1:27:53.680
 is to maximize not profit,

1:27:53.680 --> 1:27:55.620
 but maximize benefit for society.

1:27:55.620 --> 1:27:56.720
 Yeah, yeah.

1:27:56.720 --> 1:27:58.720
 Although there still will be profits,

1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:00.760
 and the profits that we're gonna make

1:28:00.760 --> 1:28:03.940
 are going to be used towards the mission of MAPS,

1:28:03.940 --> 1:28:05.920
 which is again, is this mass mental health

1:28:05.920 --> 1:28:08.040
 and ending the drug war.

1:28:08.040 --> 1:28:10.600
 And in fact, we've hired the Boston Consulting Group

1:28:10.600 --> 1:28:15.360
 to help us plot our commercialization strategy.

1:28:15.360 --> 1:28:18.040
 And so there is some suggestions based,

1:28:18.040 --> 1:28:19.920
 there's so many different assumptions in this,

1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:22.040
 the number of therapists that we train,

1:28:22.040 --> 1:28:24.480
 the price that we set for the MDMA,

1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:27.440
 whether insurance companies will cover it.

1:28:27.440 --> 1:28:30.680
 But there's the possibility of somewhere in the range

1:28:30.680 --> 1:28:33.760
 of three quarters of a billion dollars in profits

1:28:33.760 --> 1:28:36.160
 during this period of data exclusivity,

1:28:36.160 --> 1:28:40.720
 just from the US and we're talking about

1:28:40.720 --> 1:28:42.960
 trying to do this research around the world as well.

1:28:42.960 --> 1:28:45.120
 So that's what the Benefit Corporation is.

1:28:45.120 --> 1:28:47.360
 The Benefit Corporation is our pharmaceutical arm.

1:28:47.360 --> 1:28:50.000
 We're about 130 people now,

1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:51.720
 somewhere in that fluctuates,

1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:54.140
 but one third of them are in the nonprofit.

1:28:54.140 --> 1:28:57.880
 We do harm reduction, psychedelic harm reduction.

1:28:57.880 --> 1:29:02.000
 We help create programs for people

1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:04.480
 with difficult psychedelic experiences

1:29:04.480 --> 1:29:06.680
 at Burning Man, at festivals all over the world,

1:29:06.680 --> 1:29:11.040
 even in cities we're now negotiating with the police,

1:29:11.040 --> 1:29:14.200
 the city of Denver, because Denver has made the mushrooms

1:29:14.200 --> 1:29:16.680
 the lowest enforcement priority.

1:29:16.680 --> 1:29:18.960
 Oregon has passed the Oregon psilocybin initiative.

1:29:18.960 --> 1:29:21.500
 So in those areas where maybe more people

1:29:21.500 --> 1:29:23.060
 are gonna gravitate to do psychedelics,

1:29:23.060 --> 1:29:24.640
 we want there to be harm reduction

1:29:24.640 --> 1:29:27.600
 so that we don't have bad stories coming up

1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:29.120
 that would change that.

1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:31.040
 So MAPS does the psychedelic harm reduction.

1:29:31.040 --> 1:29:32.560
 We do public education.

1:29:32.560 --> 1:29:33.400
 We do a lot of it.

1:29:33.400 --> 1:29:35.120
 That's what you and I are doing right now.

1:29:35.120 --> 1:29:36.320
 We're doing that now.

1:29:38.240 --> 1:29:40.280
 But also research towards.

1:29:40.280 --> 1:29:42.960
 Well, the research now is done in the Benefit Corp.

1:29:42.960 --> 1:29:43.800
 In the Benefit Corp.

1:29:43.800 --> 1:29:46.120
 Yeah, so what happens is people donate to MAPS,

1:29:46.120 --> 1:29:48.480
 get a tax deduction, MAPS transfers the money,

1:29:48.480 --> 1:29:50.840
 or you could say invests in the Benefit Corp.

1:29:50.840 --> 1:29:51.680
 Yes.

1:29:51.680 --> 1:29:53.000
 The Benefit Corp will do the research

1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:55.640
 and then MAPS is the sponsor,

1:29:55.640 --> 1:29:57.640
 but then we will license the sale of MDMA

1:29:57.640 --> 1:29:58.720
 to the Benefit Corp, so.

1:29:58.720 --> 1:30:01.240
 Got it, but the research is done with an eye

1:30:01.240 --> 1:30:03.480
 towards creating something that has a big impact

1:30:03.480 --> 1:30:06.120
 versus just research for knowledge's sake.

1:30:06.120 --> 1:30:11.120
 Yeah, yeah, because I'm interested in political change.

1:30:13.080 --> 1:30:16.640
 The other part of it, which is that the brain

1:30:16.640 --> 1:30:20.160
 is the most complex thing we know in the universe.

1:30:21.040 --> 1:30:22.400
 It's endless.

1:30:22.400 --> 1:30:24.600
 I mean, when are we gonna really, like this idea of,

1:30:24.600 --> 1:30:26.000
 will we figure out telepathy?

1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:28.760
 Will we figure out tapping into the collective unconscious?

1:30:28.760 --> 1:30:31.160
 What is the extents of our brain?

1:30:31.160 --> 1:30:32.320
 How does the brain actually work?

1:30:32.320 --> 1:30:33.880
 Do you ask chemistry questions?

1:30:33.880 --> 1:30:36.480
 So if it's just the pursuit of knowledge,

1:30:36.480 --> 1:30:37.920
 that is an endless thing.

1:30:37.920 --> 1:30:39.440
 And how does that end the drug war?

1:30:39.440 --> 1:30:41.120
 How does that help people directly?

1:30:41.120 --> 1:30:43.720
 So that's why we're focused on drug development

1:30:43.720 --> 1:30:45.800
 more than mechanism of action.

1:30:45.800 --> 1:30:48.520
 Before I ask you about one,

1:30:48.520 --> 1:30:50.960
 but several really exciting studies,

1:30:51.880 --> 1:30:54.760
 let me ask sort of a personal question for me.

1:30:54.760 --> 1:30:59.080
 So if I wanted to get psychedelics

1:30:59.080 --> 1:31:04.080
 from the MAPS Public Benefit Corporation

1:31:04.240 --> 1:31:09.240
 and explore my own mind, how do I get to do that?

1:31:10.040 --> 1:31:10.880
 And when?

1:31:10.880 --> 1:31:12.000
 You won't be able to.

1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:12.840
 You'll never be able to.

1:31:12.840 --> 1:31:14.400
 This is very unfortunate.

1:31:14.400 --> 1:31:17.160
 Because the reason is because the Benefit Corp

1:31:17.160 --> 1:31:20.120
 is designed as a pharmaceutical company.

1:31:20.120 --> 1:31:23.800
 So we can only work on clinical indication.

1:31:23.800 --> 1:31:25.840
 So let's say you come to me and you just say,

1:31:25.840 --> 1:31:27.080
 oh, I'm really depressed.

1:31:27.080 --> 1:31:30.560
 Can I get MDMA to overcome my depression

1:31:30.560 --> 1:31:32.880
 or overcome my PTSD?

1:31:32.880 --> 1:31:35.760
 We'll have to do research in those indications.

1:31:35.760 --> 1:31:38.200
 And by when you say me, you mean like a doctor.

1:31:38.200 --> 1:31:40.560
 So this would be prescribed in theory by doctors.

1:31:40.560 --> 1:31:43.560
 Well, this would go through a doctor and a prescription.

1:31:43.560 --> 1:31:46.480
 Okay, let me ask another question.

1:31:46.480 --> 1:31:47.320
 To further answer,

1:31:47.320 --> 1:31:49.600
 so that's where the drug policy arm comes in,

1:31:49.600 --> 1:31:51.160
 the drug policy reform.

1:31:51.160 --> 1:31:54.520
 So you should be able to get access to psychedelics

1:31:54.520 --> 1:31:56.560
 for your own personal growth.

1:31:56.560 --> 1:31:59.160
 But that's not medicine.

1:31:59.160 --> 1:32:02.160
 So that's why we need to medicalize,

1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:04.600
 to have things covered by insurance,

1:32:04.600 --> 1:32:07.440
 to change people's attitudes, the public attitudes.

1:32:07.440 --> 1:32:11.720
 And then we get this subsequent drug policy reform.

1:32:11.720 --> 1:32:12.840
 And we're talking about it

1:32:12.840 --> 1:32:14.720
 in terms of licensed legalization.

1:32:14.720 --> 1:32:18.280
 So my view is you should get a license to do psychedelics,

1:32:18.280 --> 1:32:19.880
 you get a little education stuff,

1:32:19.880 --> 1:32:21.160
 and then you should be able to buy it

1:32:21.160 --> 1:32:22.000
 and do it on your own.

1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:24.160
 So let me rephrase the question in more specifically.

1:32:24.160 --> 1:32:29.080
 So when can I, if I happen to have ailments of some kind

1:32:29.080 --> 1:32:31.880
 where the doctor decides that psychedelics could help,

1:32:31.880 --> 1:32:35.160
 when would you be a loose estimate for you

1:32:35.160 --> 1:32:37.720
 of when a doctor will be able to prescribe to me

1:32:37.720 --> 1:32:41.480
 something from MAPS Public Benefit Co.

1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:45.000
 And then when for my personal growth and creativity,

1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:46.360
 would I be able to get something?

1:32:46.360 --> 1:32:49.160
 So like, just looking out, this isn't like guaranteed,

1:32:49.160 --> 1:32:53.160
 but like your vision, your hope for,

1:32:53.160 --> 1:32:56.000
 yeah, for psychedelics in society.

1:32:56.000 --> 1:32:59.960
 Well, the end of 2023, so two and a half years from now,

1:32:59.960 --> 1:33:02.240
 we anticipate FDA approval

1:33:02.240 --> 1:33:04.960
 for the prescription use of MDMA for PTSD.

1:33:05.840 --> 1:33:10.840
 Because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine,

1:33:11.680 --> 1:33:14.720
 there is what's called off label prescription.

1:33:14.720 --> 1:33:16.840
 What that means, the label is what it's approved for.

1:33:16.840 --> 1:33:20.320
 So the label will say, oh, this is approved for PTSD.

1:33:20.320 --> 1:33:23.200
 But let's say you come and anything else, social anxiety

1:33:23.200 --> 1:33:24.720
 or whatever, you can go to the doctor,

1:33:24.720 --> 1:33:26.360
 they can give it to you.

1:33:26.360 --> 1:33:27.920
 It might not be covered by insurance,

1:33:27.920 --> 1:33:30.560
 they have to be a little bit careful about malpractice.

1:33:30.560 --> 1:33:32.640
 But I think the end of 2023

1:33:32.640 --> 1:33:34.880
 is when you will be able to do that.

1:33:34.880 --> 1:33:38.800
 Now, there's actually another program, very limited,

1:33:38.800 --> 1:33:42.640
 called Expanded Access, which is compassionate use,

1:33:42.640 --> 1:33:45.640
 which means that, and we have approval for 50 people

1:33:45.640 --> 1:33:48.960
 for compassionate use right now, we think that'll grow.

1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:51.320
 So that's gonna open up in about two months.

1:33:51.320 --> 1:33:53.680
 And so those are people with PTSD,

1:33:53.680 --> 1:33:55.080
 they have to be treatment resistant,

1:33:55.080 --> 1:33:56.120
 nothing has worked for them.

1:33:56.120 --> 1:33:58.480
 And they can access MDMA

1:33:58.480 --> 1:34:00.480
 while we're doing the phase three studies.

1:34:01.920 --> 1:34:04.280
 But they have to pay for it themselves.

1:34:04.280 --> 1:34:06.320
 The sponsor has to pay for all the research.

1:34:06.320 --> 1:34:09.760
 But Expanded Access, because there's no control group,

1:34:09.760 --> 1:34:12.960
 everybody gets the MDMA, people can pay for it themselves.

1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:15.320
 And we think that'll start in a couple months.

1:34:15.320 --> 1:34:17.760
 But it's very limited, it's limited to certain cities.

1:34:17.760 --> 1:34:20.520
 There's also a program called Right to Try,

1:34:20.520 --> 1:34:23.000
 which is passed through Congress.

1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:26.080
 It's similar to this idea of compassionate use,

1:34:26.080 --> 1:34:28.280
 but it cuts the FDA out of it.

1:34:28.280 --> 1:34:32.960
 And patients can negotiate directly with pharma companies

1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:34.560
 to get access to their drugs.

1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:38.800
 That's starting to happen, I think, in Canada now,

1:34:38.800 --> 1:34:41.200
 they're letting people have compassionate access

1:34:41.200 --> 1:34:44.160
 to psilocybin for life threatening illness,

1:34:44.160 --> 1:34:46.560
 because there has been studies with psilocybin

1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:49.720
 for cancer patients and others with life threatening illness.

1:34:49.720 --> 1:34:51.800
 As far as your question about when will you be able

1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:55.960
 to access this for personal growth outside of medicine?

1:34:56.840 --> 1:34:59.000
 I'll take that to mean fully legally,

1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:00.960
 where you can just go buy pure drugs somewhere,

1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:02.240
 when will that happen?

1:35:02.240 --> 1:35:05.640
 We already are starting to see the decriminalization

1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:08.400
 in certain areas of plant psychedelics.

1:35:09.240 --> 1:35:13.440
 And we see overall drug decrim, like that passed in Oregon,

1:35:13.440 --> 1:35:16.040
 so that any drug is now, it's not legal,

1:35:16.040 --> 1:35:20.720
 you can't really fully set up clinics to offer it to people

1:35:20.720 --> 1:35:22.640
 or there's no legal supply like that,

1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:24.240
 but it's decriminalized.

1:35:24.240 --> 1:35:27.480
 So my sense of things is based a lot on watching

1:35:27.480 --> 1:35:28.960
 what happened with medical marijuana

1:35:28.960 --> 1:35:30.160
 and marijuana legalization.

1:35:30.160 --> 1:35:31.800
 So we're sitting here in Massachusetts

1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:33.600
 where marijuana is legal,

1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:36.240
 but what happened first was medical marijuana.

1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:40.000
 So what we see is that medicalization,

1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:43.320
 by demonstrating that under certain contexts,

1:35:43.320 --> 1:35:47.640
 the risks are much less than the benefits,

1:35:47.640 --> 1:35:49.320
 and then there are benefits,

1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:51.440
 and then people hear stories about people

1:35:51.440 --> 1:35:53.000
 that have gotten better,

1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:54.520
 and then that changes their minds,

1:35:54.520 --> 1:35:57.080
 and then eventually that builds up to why are we throwing

1:35:57.080 --> 1:35:57.920
 people in jail for this?

1:35:57.920 --> 1:35:59.200
 Just the culture, yeah.

1:35:59.200 --> 1:36:02.520
 Yeah, so I think that what we're gonna have 2023

1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:07.040
 is MDMA approved by the FDA, chances are.

1:36:07.040 --> 1:36:09.800
 Psilocybin will be a year or two after that.

1:36:09.800 --> 1:36:11.600
 Then what we're gonna need is a decade

1:36:11.600 --> 1:36:14.120
 of psychedelic clinics that are gonna roll out

1:36:14.120 --> 1:36:17.920
 across America, also other countries as well,

1:36:17.920 --> 1:36:20.040
 thousands of these psychedelic clinics.

1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:22.680
 We already have hundreds of ketamine clinics

1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:26.120
 that are ketamine for depression.

1:36:26.120 --> 1:36:28.200
 More and more people are realizing that ketamine,

1:36:28.200 --> 1:36:31.520
 when it's used with therapy, it's better than when it's not.

1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:34.120
 But the therapists wanna be psychedelic therapists.

1:36:34.120 --> 1:36:36.720
 They don't wanna be a ketamine therapist or an MDMA therapist.

1:36:36.720 --> 1:36:38.360
 So they'll be cross trained.

1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:40.480
 So we will have a decade of these thousands

1:36:40.480 --> 1:36:42.360
 of psychedelic clinics and all these stories

1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:43.200
 of people getting better.

1:36:43.200 --> 1:36:46.400
 And 2035 is when I think that we will move

1:36:46.400 --> 1:36:49.800
 to licensed legalization, which is when you will

1:36:49.800 --> 1:36:52.960
 have the option of just going somewhere

1:36:52.960 --> 1:36:55.440
 once you've done this educational stuff.

1:36:55.440 --> 1:36:58.040
 Potentially, I also think it would be better

1:36:58.040 --> 1:37:02.080
 to have the opportunity for people to go for free,

1:37:02.080 --> 1:37:04.360
 paid for by tax money, to these clinics,

1:37:04.360 --> 1:37:05.760
 and you have your first experience

1:37:05.760 --> 1:37:08.080
 with psychedelics under supervision.

1:37:08.080 --> 1:37:09.720
 And you know what you're getting into.

1:37:09.720 --> 1:37:12.840
 You've, you know, to ask the questionnaire,

1:37:12.840 --> 1:37:14.120
 what the risks are with the drugs,

1:37:14.120 --> 1:37:15.760
 then you get your license.

1:37:15.760 --> 1:37:18.000
 So 2035 is when I think that'll happen.

1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:20.880
 And the clinics will be sites of these initiations.

1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:21.840
 Yes.

1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:23.760
 And so it'd be a safe environment, just like you said,

1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:27.240
 all the things that are actually maximize the likelihood

1:37:27.240 --> 1:37:30.120
 of a pleasant experience and all those kinds of things.

1:37:30.120 --> 1:37:32.520
 It is a frustratingly slow process.

1:37:32.520 --> 1:37:36.600
 And the FDA being part of that process is very frustrating.

1:37:36.600 --> 1:37:40.000
 But of course there's benefits,

1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:44.000
 but boy, I wish it could move a lot faster.

1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:45.800
 Yeah, well, one thing that I've learned

1:37:45.800 --> 1:37:50.800
 from being a parent is that when you have little kids,

1:37:52.640 --> 1:37:55.320
 it seems like they'll be with you forever.

1:37:55.320 --> 1:37:58.280
 But then when they grow up and they go to college

1:37:58.280 --> 1:37:59.760
 and they leave, do you look back and like,

1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:01.800
 where did that 20 years go?

1:38:01.800 --> 1:38:02.640
 Yeah.

1:38:02.640 --> 1:38:05.240
 You know, so we're still dealing with the legacy

1:38:05.240 --> 1:38:08.000
 of the civil war and slavery in America.

1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:11.560
 So actually a 20 year plan is not that long.

1:38:11.560 --> 1:38:16.560
 So while we say it's frustratingly slow, and it is,

1:38:17.680 --> 1:38:21.400
 I mean, it's 50 years since the psychedelic sixties.

1:38:21.400 --> 1:38:26.400
 And right now it's 36 years since MDMA was criminalized.

1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:31.600
 And you think about all those people that committed suicide

1:38:31.600 --> 1:38:34.240
 from PTSD or from anything else.

1:38:34.240 --> 1:38:36.840
 And all those people that could have been helped

1:38:36.840 --> 1:38:40.440
 if the DEA had accepted the Administrative Law Judge

1:38:40.440 --> 1:38:42.920
 recommendation that MDMA stay in schedule three.

1:38:42.920 --> 1:38:45.320
 It's tremendously sad.

1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:48.360
 At the same time, culture evolves slowly.

1:38:48.360 --> 1:38:50.420
 You know, you read the Bible or you read all this stuff,

1:38:50.420 --> 1:38:53.260
 we're not that different from people thousands of years ago.

1:38:53.260 --> 1:38:56.880
 So how are we gonna really evolve enough

1:38:56.880 --> 1:38:58.440
 over the next couple of decades

1:38:58.440 --> 1:39:01.520
 so we don't destroy the planet and don't kill each other?

1:39:01.520 --> 1:39:04.600
 That's why I think psychedelics have an important role

1:39:04.600 --> 1:39:07.800
 to play, that's why I've devoted my life to psychedelics.

1:39:07.800 --> 1:39:09.600
 And it is frustratingly slow.

1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:13.360
 And what I said to myself is our whole effort

1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:15.340
 has not been fast enough.

1:39:15.340 --> 1:39:18.600
 Can we talk a little bit about PTSD and MDMA?

1:39:18.600 --> 1:39:22.720
 There's this fascinating paper came out

1:39:22.720 --> 1:39:26.520
 on a fascinating study that you're a part of.

1:39:26.520 --> 1:39:27.920
 That's a phase three study.

1:39:27.920 --> 1:39:29.580
 Can you describe what the study is?

1:39:29.580 --> 1:39:31.780
 Can you describe what phase three means?

1:39:31.780 --> 1:39:35.000
 Can you describe what the findings are

1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:39.020
 and why it's in fact so important and impactful?

1:39:39.020 --> 1:39:41.840
 Yeah, this study came out May 10th in Nature Medicine.

1:39:41.840 --> 1:39:44.680
 So one of the highest impact factors in medicine,

1:39:44.680 --> 1:39:46.160
 journals, it was tremendous.

1:39:46.160 --> 1:39:48.780
 So to make a drug into a medicine,

1:39:48.780 --> 1:39:51.280
 the first thing you need to do is what are called

1:39:52.360 --> 1:39:54.240
 nonclinical or preclinical studies,

1:39:54.240 --> 1:39:57.040
 meaning safety established in animals.

1:39:57.040 --> 1:39:58.440
 What does the drug do?

1:39:58.440 --> 1:40:00.080
 What are the side effects in animals?

1:40:00.080 --> 1:40:01.240
 Where do you see the risks?

1:40:01.240 --> 1:40:05.600
 And then you negotiate with FDA to do phase one studies.

1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:07.440
 And phase one studies are where you move

1:40:07.440 --> 1:40:09.280
 from animals to humans.

1:40:09.280 --> 1:40:11.960
 And those are more safety studies

1:40:11.960 --> 1:40:14.500
 and trying to describe what the drug does

1:40:14.500 --> 1:40:16.160
 so that you can determine

1:40:16.160 --> 1:40:19.120
 if there is potential medical value there.

1:40:19.120 --> 1:40:24.120
 Certain drugs like cancer drugs are so toxic

1:40:24.120 --> 1:40:29.120
 that you don't have phase one studies in healthy volunteers.

1:40:29.120 --> 1:40:31.440
 That's like phase one slash two,

1:40:31.440 --> 1:40:33.840
 where you bring in the patients,

1:40:33.840 --> 1:40:35.880
 but you still are doing sort of dose response

1:40:35.880 --> 1:40:38.640
 safety studies, but you use patients.

1:40:38.640 --> 1:40:41.640
 But most phase one studies are healthy volunteers.

1:40:41.640 --> 1:40:45.440
 Phase two are where you start bringing in the patients

1:40:45.440 --> 1:40:48.400
 and you start experimenting with various different things.

1:40:48.400 --> 1:40:52.120
 The purpose of phase two is really just to design phase three.

1:40:52.120 --> 1:40:55.480
 Now, again, I'm sort of putting out of the picture

1:40:55.480 --> 1:40:57.240
 in another area is mechanism of action.

1:40:57.240 --> 1:40:58.680
 How do these drugs work?

1:40:58.680 --> 1:41:01.440
 Phase two, you're trying to figure out what they do,

1:41:02.800 --> 1:41:05.400
 who your patient population is, what are the risks,

1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:07.800
 who do you include, who do you exclude,

1:41:07.800 --> 1:41:10.520
 what are the doses, what is your treatment,

1:41:10.520 --> 1:41:11.960
 what are your measures.

1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:18.160
 In our case, it was how do you do a double blind study?

1:41:18.160 --> 1:41:20.240
 That was a big part of phase two.

1:41:20.240 --> 1:41:22.800
 That's a big challenge for psychedelic drugs.

1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:25.880
 Any kind of drugs that have a real strong effect,

1:41:25.880 --> 1:41:27.480
 how do you do a double blind study?

1:41:27.480 --> 1:41:28.960
 The double blind, sorry to interrupt,

1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:33.480
 would mean that the patient should not be aware

1:41:33.480 --> 1:41:35.800
 whether it's a placebo or not.

1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:36.960
 And the researcher.

1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:39.160
 And the researcher is not aware.

1:41:39.160 --> 1:41:41.000
 And so for that lack of awareness,

1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:42.320
 when the effect is really strong,

1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:44.160
 it's very difficult to do on both the researcher

1:41:44.160 --> 1:41:45.680
 and the patient side.

1:41:45.680 --> 1:41:49.200
 Yes, and sometimes they talk about triple blind.

1:41:49.200 --> 1:41:51.280
 So the other part is the raters

1:41:51.280 --> 1:41:54.080
 that evaluate the symptoms and before and after.

1:41:54.080 --> 1:41:55.880
 So you ideally want triple blind.

1:41:55.880 --> 1:41:58.880
 You want the patients, the researchers,

1:41:58.880 --> 1:42:02.200
 and the evaluators of the outcomes, all of them,

1:42:02.200 --> 1:42:05.320
 not to know what the drug, whether it was drug or placebo,

1:42:05.320 --> 1:42:07.560
 and that's to reduce experiment or bias.

1:42:10.200 --> 1:42:12.040
 And then you move to phase three,

1:42:12.040 --> 1:42:15.560
 once you've figured out how to design the phase three studies.

1:42:15.560 --> 1:42:18.800
 And phase three are the large scale multiple studies

1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:23.000
 multi site, placebo controlled, double blind studies,

1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:25.520
 where you must prove safety and efficacy

1:42:25.520 --> 1:42:28.520
 in order to get permission to market the drug.

1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:33.120
 Now, for us, when we started MAPS in 86,

1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:36.040
 as I said, it was one year after the criminalization

1:42:36.040 --> 1:42:39.880
 of MDMA in 85, we had five different protocols

1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:43.960
 that were rejected by the FDA for studying with MDMA.

1:42:43.960 --> 1:42:46.800
 And these were all various phase one studies.

1:42:46.800 --> 1:42:49.240
 They came from Harvard, from UC San Francisco,

1:42:49.240 --> 1:42:51.360
 from the University in Arizona,

1:42:51.360 --> 1:42:53.840
 and Albuquerque, New Mexico, all over.

1:42:53.840 --> 1:42:55.640
 And they were all rejected.

1:42:55.640 --> 1:42:59.040
 1992, six years after we started,

1:42:59.040 --> 1:43:01.840
 we got the first permission for phase one.

1:43:02.720 --> 1:43:05.560
 And that took us through much of the 90s.

1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:08.160
 Again, things are slow because we have to raise the money

1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:09.320
 through donations.

1:43:09.320 --> 1:43:14.320
 And then in 1999 is when we started the work with PTSD.

1:43:14.320 --> 1:43:19.320
 And that then took us till November 29th, 2016,

1:43:22.720 --> 1:43:25.920
 which is when we had the end of phase two meeting with FDA.

1:43:25.920 --> 1:43:29.200
 So it took 30 years from the start of MAPS

1:43:29.200 --> 1:43:31.960
 to the end of phase two meeting with FDA.

1:43:31.960 --> 1:43:35.520
 And what we had discovered during phase two

1:43:35.520 --> 1:43:38.960
 was several different key points.

1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:42.440
 The drugs that are available right now for PTSD,

1:43:42.440 --> 1:43:45.320
 the SSRIs, Zoloft and Paxil,

1:43:45.320 --> 1:43:47.960
 that have been approved by FDA and regulators in Europe

1:43:47.960 --> 1:43:52.200
 as well, the European Medicines Agency, for PTSD,

1:43:52.200 --> 1:43:54.600
 they work better in women than in men,

1:43:54.600 --> 1:43:57.520
 and they failed in combat related PTSD.

1:43:58.560 --> 1:44:02.000
 All right, so what we learned is that MDMA assisted therapy

1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:03.880
 works just as well in men or women,

1:44:03.880 --> 1:44:06.480
 and it works in combat related PTSD.

1:44:06.480 --> 1:44:09.280
 It works in regardless of the cause of PTSD.

1:44:09.280 --> 1:44:12.960
 We also discovered that even though there are stories

1:44:12.960 --> 1:44:16.080
 that people take MDMA at raves and they dance all night

1:44:16.080 --> 1:44:18.040
 and they overheat and they get hypothermia

1:44:18.040 --> 1:44:20.400
 and they die from overheating, which is true

1:44:20.400 --> 1:44:22.200
 and can happen from pure MDMA,

1:44:23.200 --> 1:44:25.400
 or that sometimes people have heard about

1:44:25.400 --> 1:44:29.080
 needing to cool down and so they drink water

1:44:29.080 --> 1:44:31.440
 and then while they're dancing all night

1:44:31.440 --> 1:44:32.840
 and then they drink too much water

1:44:32.840 --> 1:44:34.280
 and then they dilute their blood

1:44:34.280 --> 1:44:36.520
 and they die from hyponatremia.

1:44:36.520 --> 1:44:39.440
 So there are risks of MDMA, but we discovered

1:44:39.440 --> 1:44:41.040
 that in a therapeutic setting,

1:44:41.040 --> 1:44:42.680
 we can control all those risks,

1:44:42.680 --> 1:44:44.960
 those things don't happen at all.

1:44:44.960 --> 1:44:48.560
 So we discovered safety, we could demonstrate safety.

1:44:49.680 --> 1:44:53.680
 We also figured out that our measure, the CAPS,

1:44:53.680 --> 1:44:55.920
 the Clinician Administrative PTSD Scale,

1:44:55.920 --> 1:44:58.320
 that it's the gold standard all over the world

1:44:58.320 --> 1:44:59.840
 for measuring PTSD symptoms,

1:44:59.840 --> 1:45:02.440
 it's what the FDA and the EMA require.

1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:04.760
 We discovered that it was a good measure for us

1:45:04.760 --> 1:45:06.880
 and that we could show changes in that.

1:45:07.880 --> 1:45:11.400
 The other big thing that we learned is that,

1:45:11.400 --> 1:45:13.040
 and we haven't mentioned this yet,

1:45:13.040 --> 1:45:16.800
 but the work in the 50s and 60s with LSD and psilocybin

1:45:16.800 --> 1:45:19.000
 and the modern research over the last 20 years

1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:20.840
 with psilocybin and classic psychedelics

1:45:20.840 --> 1:45:23.120
 has demonstrated that there's a link

1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:24.960
 between this mystical experience,

1:45:24.960 --> 1:45:28.280
 this unit of mystical experience and therapeutic outcomes

1:45:28.280 --> 1:45:29.560
 for the treatment of addiction,

1:45:29.560 --> 1:45:32.320
 for working with people with life threatening illnesses

1:45:32.320 --> 1:45:36.760
 that for OCD, for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,

1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:39.800
 that there's with the classic psychedelics,

1:45:39.800 --> 1:45:42.600
 both in the 50 years ago and then the research now

1:45:42.600 --> 1:45:45.240
 has been that there's a link between the depth

1:45:45.240 --> 1:45:48.680
 of the mystical experience and therapeutic outcome.

1:45:48.680 --> 1:45:52.320
 What we discovered is that that's not the case for MDMA,

1:45:52.320 --> 1:45:55.000
 that people do score fairly high

1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:56.960
 on the scales of mystical experience,

1:45:56.960 --> 1:45:59.240
 not as high as they do with the classic psychedelics,

1:45:59.240 --> 1:46:02.480
 but they do score pretty high on average.

1:46:02.480 --> 1:46:06.360
 And a significant number of them have over the cutoff

1:46:06.360 --> 1:46:09.120
 for what would be considered a full mystical experience.

1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:11.840
 So enough to say that we could look at a correlation

1:46:11.840 --> 1:46:13.600
 and we didn't find any.

1:46:13.600 --> 1:46:15.120
 The other thing that we discovered,

1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:20.000
 and this was more humbling, I would say for me personally,

1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:22.400
 is that my dissertation at the Kennedy School,

1:46:22.400 --> 1:46:24.440
 a big part of it was on the,

1:46:24.440 --> 1:46:26.240
 it's about the regulation of the medical use

1:46:26.240 --> 1:46:27.840
 of psychedelics in marijuana.

1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:29.680
 A big part of my dissertation was how to do

1:46:29.680 --> 1:46:31.760
 the double blind study.

1:46:31.760 --> 1:46:33.200
 And I thought I'd solve the problem

1:46:33.200 --> 1:46:35.560
 and I persuaded my dissertation committee

1:46:35.560 --> 1:46:37.480
 that I'd solve the problem.

1:46:37.480 --> 1:46:41.240
 And the solution was therapy with low dose MDMA

1:46:41.240 --> 1:46:43.960
 versus therapy with full dose MDMA.

1:46:43.960 --> 1:46:46.840
 And everybody knows that they're gonna get MDMA,

1:46:46.840 --> 1:46:49.040
 most of these people have never done it before,

1:46:49.040 --> 1:46:52.640
 they'll be confused about is it full dose or low dose.

1:46:52.640 --> 1:46:56.200
 And then the challenge is to pick a dose

1:46:56.200 --> 1:47:00.080
 that's high enough so that there is this confusion,

1:47:00.080 --> 1:47:02.120
 but not so high that it's so therapeutic

1:47:02.120 --> 1:47:04.800
 that we can't tell the difference between the groups.

1:47:04.800 --> 1:47:09.360
 So we studied zero, meaning inactive placebo,

1:47:09.360 --> 1:47:12.120
 25 milligrams, 30 milligrams, 40 milligrams,

1:47:12.120 --> 1:47:14.680
 50 milligrams, 75 milligrams, 100 milligrams,

1:47:14.680 --> 1:47:16.320
 125 and 150.

1:47:18.120 --> 1:47:21.960
 What we discovered is that my dissertation was wrong

1:47:21.960 --> 1:47:24.320
 and that there is no good solution

1:47:24.320 --> 1:47:26.280
 to the double blind problem.

1:47:26.280 --> 1:47:31.280
 What we found is that, to our surprise actually,

1:47:31.320 --> 1:47:34.840
 was that 75 milligrams was an effective dose.

1:47:34.840 --> 1:47:36.880
 We didn't think that.

1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:39.120
 I mean, the normal dose is like,

1:47:39.120 --> 1:47:42.720
 full dose is like 125 milligrams, something like that.

1:47:42.720 --> 1:47:45.560
 But 75 milligrams was an effective dose.

1:47:45.560 --> 1:47:48.000
 And we discovered that the lower doses,

1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:50.160
 so I was half right, you could say,

1:47:50.160 --> 1:47:53.440
 the doses of 25, 30, 40, 50,

1:47:53.440 --> 1:47:57.040
 they could produce enough confusion

1:47:57.040 --> 1:47:59.440
 that you could say that they were successful at blinding,

1:47:59.440 --> 1:48:02.080
 not perfectly, but enough confusion

1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:05.120
 so that people, therapists, couldn't know for sure

1:48:05.120 --> 1:48:08.760
 so that there was this reduction of bias, you could say.

1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:14.120
 But what we discovered, again, to our surprise,

1:48:14.120 --> 1:48:17.400
 was that the low doses made people uncomfortable.

1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:23.400
 They stimulated them, but they didn't reduce the fear.

1:48:23.400 --> 1:48:25.920
 And so people still got better

1:48:25.920 --> 1:48:28.080
 with the therapy with low dose MDMA.

1:48:28.080 --> 1:48:31.800
 But if we gave them therapy with inactive placebo,

1:48:31.800 --> 1:48:33.840
 they did even better

1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:37.360
 than if we gave them therapy with low dose MDMA.

1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:41.320
 So we call it an anti therapeutic effect.

1:48:41.320 --> 1:48:43.520
 I don't mean to imply that they got worse,

1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:45.440
 but it made people uncomfortable.

1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:47.360
 People didn't like it.

1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:49.840
 But we would still help them make some progress.

1:48:49.840 --> 1:48:51.520
 So we had the blinding,

1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:54.720
 but what it meant by reducing the effect of therapy

1:48:54.720 --> 1:48:57.480
 with inactive placebo is that it would make it easier

1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:00.040
 for us to find a difference between the two groups.

1:49:01.080 --> 1:49:02.760
 And so the real question is,

1:49:02.760 --> 1:49:07.240
 if you can do it with therapy, why bother add a drug?

1:49:07.240 --> 1:49:09.160
 So we went to the FDA,

1:49:09.160 --> 1:49:12.000
 and so this was what we discovered during phase two.

1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:15.120
 We went to the FDA at this end of phase two meeting,

1:49:15.120 --> 1:49:17.600
 and we said, we can give you blinding,

1:49:17.600 --> 1:49:20.240
 but it will make it easier for us

1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:22.040
 to find a difference between the two groups.

1:49:22.040 --> 1:49:26.320
 And so we suggest that we do therapy with inactive placebo

1:49:26.320 --> 1:49:29.440
 versus therapy with full dose MDMA.

1:49:29.440 --> 1:49:30.920
 That will cause a problem

1:49:30.920 --> 1:49:34.320
 because most people will be able to tell what they've got.

1:49:34.320 --> 1:49:36.920
 What Tom Loughran, a doctor

1:49:36.920 --> 1:49:39.400
 who used to be head of psychiatry products at FDA

1:49:39.400 --> 1:49:41.640
 is our main advisor.

1:49:41.640 --> 1:49:42.880
 So the first thing he said

1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:45.480
 is that the double blind fails in practice a lot,

1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:47.360
 even with SSRIs,

1:49:47.360 --> 1:49:49.400
 because there's certain side effects

1:49:49.400 --> 1:49:50.720
 that you have with these drugs.

1:49:50.720 --> 1:49:52.640
 And the doctors who are doing these research

1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:55.240
 when you're reporting your side effects,

1:49:55.240 --> 1:49:56.400
 they can say, oh, that's probably,

1:49:56.400 --> 1:49:58.280
 you got the active drug instead of the placebo.

1:49:58.280 --> 1:50:01.800
 So the double blind is in theory is terrific,

1:50:01.800 --> 1:50:05.760
 but in practice, it doesn't always work quite as well.

1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:10.160
 And so what Tom said is that there are two main approaches

1:50:10.160 --> 1:50:13.240
 that they think are important to reduce bias.

1:50:13.240 --> 1:50:15.160
 The first one is easy to do.

1:50:15.160 --> 1:50:17.800
 It's called random assignment.

1:50:17.800 --> 1:50:19.720
 So sometimes there are studies

1:50:19.720 --> 1:50:24.200
 where you'll treat a bunch of people with something

1:50:24.200 --> 1:50:26.720
 and some fraction of them will get better and some won't.

1:50:26.720 --> 1:50:29.160
 And then you say, okay, all those who didn't get better,

1:50:29.160 --> 1:50:31.800
 who volunteers to get this new treatment?

1:50:31.800 --> 1:50:33.200
 And then you give them the new treatment,

1:50:33.200 --> 1:50:34.320
 but the people that volunteer

1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:36.000
 are more likely to wanna get better.

1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:39.680
 They're not representative sample of everybody that has.

1:50:39.680 --> 1:50:41.680
 So when you have random assignment,

1:50:41.680 --> 1:50:43.880
 everybody is similarly motivated

1:50:43.880 --> 1:50:47.280
 and meets the same inclusion, exclusion criteria.

1:50:47.280 --> 1:50:48.680
 So that's what we told,

1:50:48.680 --> 1:50:50.400
 of course we need random assignment.

1:50:50.400 --> 1:50:54.040
 The other part was when the bias double blind

1:50:54.040 --> 1:50:55.760
 doesn't work as well,

1:50:55.760 --> 1:50:59.800
 then the system of independent raters

1:50:59.800 --> 1:51:03.000
 is especially important of how you do that.

1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:08.000
 So we have over a pool of raters, over 20 of them,

1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:11.880
 and we do this monthly interrater reliability tests

1:51:11.880 --> 1:51:15.200
 to make sure that they evaluate this,

1:51:15.200 --> 1:51:17.640
 so that they're given a videotape of a PTSD patient

1:51:17.640 --> 1:51:19.640
 and then they're supposed to rate them

1:51:19.640 --> 1:51:20.800
 according to their symptoms.

1:51:20.800 --> 1:51:22.760
 And then we sort of make sure

1:51:22.760 --> 1:51:24.920
 that we've got this calibrated rater pool

1:51:25.840 --> 1:51:28.760
 and it's all done by Zoom, by telemedicine,

1:51:28.760 --> 1:51:30.880
 and they're randomly assigned to the next person

1:51:30.880 --> 1:51:32.600
 that needs a rating.

1:51:32.600 --> 1:51:34.280
 So they said 20 raters.

1:51:34.280 --> 1:51:35.800
 So we've got like 20 raters

1:51:35.800 --> 1:51:40.280
 and what we wanna do is make it so that each rater

1:51:40.280 --> 1:51:43.640
 sees each patient only once, maybe twice,

1:51:43.640 --> 1:51:47.120
 but not tracking them through the study.

1:51:47.120 --> 1:51:49.440
 So that tries to reduce the bias in the raters

1:51:49.440 --> 1:51:52.200
 that they don't know where this person is in the study.

1:51:54.760 --> 1:51:59.040
 And so there's a fellow, Bob Temple,

1:51:59.040 --> 1:52:01.280
 who's like the old wise man at the FDA.

1:52:01.280 --> 1:52:03.680
 He's been there since 1972.

1:52:03.680 --> 1:52:05.880
 He was in charge of the Office of Science Policy

1:52:05.880 --> 1:52:09.840
 and they brought him into the final meeting of this process

1:52:09.840 --> 1:52:11.880
 where we are trying to design phase three.

1:52:11.880 --> 1:52:14.640
 So once FDA said, yes, you can go to phase three,

1:52:14.640 --> 1:52:17.840
 that was November 29th, 2016,

1:52:17.840 --> 1:52:20.320
 we then negotiated for eight months

1:52:20.320 --> 1:52:21.760
 on the design of phase three

1:52:21.760 --> 1:52:25.320
 and all of the other information that FDA is gonna need.

1:52:25.320 --> 1:52:26.840
 This process of design.

1:52:28.920 --> 1:52:31.920
 To the extent that I have any artistic creativity,

1:52:31.920 --> 1:52:34.520
 it's in protocol design.

1:52:34.520 --> 1:52:35.760
 I really love that.

1:52:35.760 --> 1:52:36.960
 So you enjoy this process.

1:52:36.960 --> 1:52:37.800
 I love it.

1:52:37.800 --> 1:52:39.480
 I love it because it's always trade offs

1:52:39.480 --> 1:52:44.480
 and I acknowledge that we are all biased.

1:52:44.840 --> 1:52:46.080
 And so how do you,

1:52:46.080 --> 1:52:49.600
 there's something beautiful about the scientific process

1:52:49.600 --> 1:52:51.440
 designed to get you to the truth.

1:52:52.720 --> 1:52:54.520
 Especially when that scientific process

1:52:54.520 --> 1:52:57.080
 is trying to get to the truth of the human organism,

1:52:57.080 --> 1:52:58.760
 which is so complicated.

1:52:58.760 --> 1:53:01.960
 So it's very difficult to dissect,

1:53:01.960 --> 1:53:04.360
 to get the strong effects.

1:53:04.360 --> 1:53:06.320
 And when you're analyzing,

1:53:06.320 --> 1:53:09.600
 when you have like raters, they're watching a video.

1:53:11.920 --> 1:53:15.480
 Removing subjectivity from that is very, very challenging.

1:53:15.480 --> 1:53:17.160
 Yeah, very much so.

1:53:18.800 --> 1:53:21.640
 And so we came to this agreement with FDA though

1:53:21.640 --> 1:53:25.840
 that we would use this independent rater pool.

1:53:25.840 --> 1:53:30.840
 And so we learned in phase two again,

1:53:30.840 --> 1:53:31.880
 that the double blind,

1:53:31.880 --> 1:53:34.000
 there was no solution to the double blind problem.

1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:37.040
 And both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency

1:53:37.040 --> 1:53:39.680
 in the end agreed that the best design

1:53:39.680 --> 1:53:41.800
 was therapy with inactive placebo

1:53:41.800 --> 1:53:43.800
 versus therapy with full dose MDMA,

1:53:43.800 --> 1:53:47.120
 accepting the fact that most people will be able to tell

1:53:47.120 --> 1:53:50.240
 whether they got nothing or they got full dose MDMA.

1:53:50.240 --> 1:53:52.400
 Most therapists will be able to tell the difference,

1:53:52.400 --> 1:53:55.880
 but that makes a harder test for us

1:53:55.880 --> 1:53:57.760
 to show a difference between the two groups

1:53:57.760 --> 1:54:00.120
 because we're giving them inactive placebo

1:54:00.120 --> 1:54:03.960
 and not the anti therapeutic effect of low dose MDMA.

1:54:03.960 --> 1:54:06.080
 So once we started phase three,

1:54:06.080 --> 1:54:10.520
 so then we were able to start in 2018 phase three.

1:54:10.520 --> 1:54:13.680
 And the paper in Nature Medicine that just came out

1:54:13.680 --> 1:54:18.160
 was the results of our first phase three study.

1:54:18.160 --> 1:54:20.240
 We came to agreement with FDA

1:54:20.240 --> 1:54:22.680
 that we would do two phase three studies,

1:54:22.680 --> 1:54:24.880
 each would have 100 persons in them.

1:54:25.960 --> 1:54:29.240
 And what the FDA said to us is that they thought

1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:33.520
 that we could prove efficacy with smaller numbers

1:54:33.520 --> 1:54:36.400
 than they wanted to see for safety.

1:54:36.400 --> 1:54:38.880
 The reason they said that is it in phase two,

1:54:38.880 --> 1:54:41.360
 we had a large effect size.

1:54:41.360 --> 1:54:43.440
 So from a statistical point of view,

1:54:43.440 --> 1:54:47.040
 the bigger of an effect that you're looking for,

1:54:47.040 --> 1:54:49.080
 the fewer number of people you need

1:54:49.080 --> 1:54:51.360
 to get statistical significance.

1:54:51.360 --> 1:54:53.320
 When you're trying to find small differences,

1:54:53.320 --> 1:54:54.800
 you need large numbers of people

1:54:54.800 --> 1:54:57.900
 to sort of work out the noise.

1:54:59.800 --> 1:55:04.240
 So we came to agreement on two 100 person phase three studies.

1:55:05.280 --> 1:55:07.480
 And the idea is that it's very possible

1:55:07.480 --> 1:55:11.160
 that the first study would show the efficacy

1:55:11.160 --> 1:55:13.120
 because the effect is so strong.

1:55:13.120 --> 1:55:16.120
 Yeah, yeah, and the second, but also safety as well.

1:55:16.120 --> 1:55:19.600
 So one of the things we also realized

1:55:19.600 --> 1:55:22.400
 when you work with a highly stigmatized drug

1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:26.920
 in the midst of still the drug war and prohibition

1:55:26.920 --> 1:55:31.280
 that we need highly sympathetic subjects

1:55:31.280 --> 1:55:34.020
 and we need to make the best case we can,

1:55:34.020 --> 1:55:37.040
 which means we need to work with the hardest cases

1:55:37.040 --> 1:55:38.400
 so that this is really needed.

1:55:38.400 --> 1:55:40.920
 And so we end up enrolling people.

1:55:40.920 --> 1:55:45.040
 The first study was chronic severe PTSD.

1:55:45.040 --> 1:55:47.280
 And unlike many studies of PTSD,

1:55:47.280 --> 1:55:50.640
 we enroll people that have previously attempted suicide.

1:55:50.640 --> 1:55:51.480
 Wow.

1:55:51.480 --> 1:55:53.040
 So we have multiple people

1:55:53.040 --> 1:55:54.560
 that have tried to kill themselves

1:55:54.560 --> 1:55:57.520
 that we felt like if we were to exclude them,

1:55:57.520 --> 1:55:58.440
 what are we doing?

1:55:58.440 --> 1:56:00.520
 Those are the people that need it the most.

1:56:00.520 --> 1:56:04.320
 So we came to this agreement with FDA.

1:56:04.320 --> 1:56:09.120
 We're gonna work with chronic severe PTSD patients,

1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:11.600
 including those that had attempted suicide.

1:56:11.600 --> 1:56:14.840
 And we would do these two 100 person studies.

1:56:14.840 --> 1:56:19.760
 And we also negotiated what's called an interim analysis.

1:56:19.760 --> 1:56:22.240
 So what that means is that

1:56:22.240 --> 1:56:26.800
 when the study is underway,

1:56:26.800 --> 1:56:28.640
 and often big, big studies,

1:56:28.640 --> 1:56:30.360
 they have this kind of interim analysis

1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:31.600
 where what you do is,

1:56:31.600 --> 1:56:35.120
 and for us, we negotiate when we had 60% or 60 people

1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:37.440
 had reached the primary outcome measure

1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:39.880
 and all 100 had been enrolled,

1:56:39.880 --> 1:56:42.040
 then we would take a look at the data.

1:56:42.040 --> 1:56:46.960
 And if the statistical analysis that we did

1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:51.960
 was showing based on a certain effect size that we chose

1:56:52.680 --> 1:56:55.040
 based on what we saw in phase two,

1:56:55.040 --> 1:56:56.080
 the interim analysis

1:56:56.080 --> 1:56:59.240
 is for what's called sample size reestimation.

1:56:59.240 --> 1:57:01.200
 So what it means is if the results aren't as good

1:57:01.200 --> 1:57:04.080
 as you thought they would, you can add more people.

1:57:04.080 --> 1:57:07.720
 And then you'll get statistical significance.

1:57:07.720 --> 1:57:10.440
 It means that your effect isn't as strong as you thought.

1:57:10.440 --> 1:57:12.360
 It'll be harder to get insurance to cover it,

1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:14.400
 but FDA will still approve it

1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:18.760
 because FDA also believes that these are group averages.

1:57:18.760 --> 1:57:20.760
 There may be some people that will later figure out

1:57:20.760 --> 1:57:22.480
 respond better than others.

1:57:22.480 --> 1:57:25.080
 So they'll approve it if it's statistically significant,

1:57:25.080 --> 1:57:27.240
 even if it has a low effect size.

1:57:27.240 --> 1:57:30.120
 The SSRIs have low effect size.

1:57:30.120 --> 1:57:35.120
 So we did the interim analysis in March of 2020.

1:57:35.840 --> 1:57:38.080
 And what we discovered to our delight

1:57:38.080 --> 1:57:41.760
 was that we did not need to add any subjects.

1:57:41.760 --> 1:57:42.800
 That's all we were told.

1:57:42.800 --> 1:57:45.800
 We weren't told like, what is the results?

1:57:45.800 --> 1:57:48.680
 We were just told all we were gonna get is a number, zero,

1:57:48.680 --> 1:57:50.960
 or you need to add X numbers of people to the study

1:57:50.960 --> 1:57:53.200
 to get statistical significance.

1:57:53.200 --> 1:57:55.400
 That's right around the time that COVID hit

1:57:55.400 --> 1:57:56.720
 and lockdowns happened.

1:57:56.720 --> 1:57:59.240
 And we ended up negotiating with FDA

1:57:59.240 --> 1:58:02.600
 that we would end the study with 90 people instead of 100.

1:58:04.800 --> 1:58:06.680
 It took a while for us to end up doing that.

1:58:06.680 --> 1:58:08.360
 So the paper that we just published

1:58:08.360 --> 1:58:10.960
 is on the results of 90 people.

1:58:10.960 --> 1:58:13.280
 I think it was 46 in the MDMA group,

1:58:13.280 --> 1:58:15.440
 44 in the placebo group.

1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:21.400
 And what we discovered was that the study worked better

1:58:21.400 --> 1:58:23.280
 than we had even hoped.

1:58:23.280 --> 1:58:25.520
 So the first thing is that

1:58:25.520 --> 1:58:27.240
 you look at statistical significance.

1:58:27.240 --> 1:58:28.560
 You have to get 0.05,

1:58:28.560 --> 1:58:30.600
 which basically means a nickel out of a dollar,

1:58:30.600 --> 1:58:33.160
 a one in 20 chance that the difference

1:58:33.160 --> 1:58:36.320
 between the two groups is due to some random factor

1:58:36.320 --> 1:58:38.200
 rather than to your intervention.

1:58:38.200 --> 1:58:42.040
 And in this case, the placebo group gets therapy

1:58:42.920 --> 1:58:44.800
 and then with inactive placebo

1:58:44.800 --> 1:58:49.200
 and then the group gets MDMA with active placebo.

1:58:49.200 --> 1:58:52.200
 So you have to get 0.05.

1:58:52.200 --> 1:58:53.800
 There's another measure

1:58:53.800 --> 1:58:56.840
 that the FDA uses sometimes called robust,

1:58:56.840 --> 1:58:59.520
 which means one in a thousand,

1:58:59.520 --> 1:59:01.600
 instead of one in 20, one in a thousand.

1:59:01.600 --> 1:59:06.600
 And if you get a robust results, 0.001,

1:59:06.680 --> 1:59:08.400
 and you meet some other criteria,

1:59:09.440 --> 1:59:11.520
 they might agree to approve the drug

1:59:11.520 --> 1:59:15.120
 on the basis of just one phase three study instead of two.

1:59:15.120 --> 1:59:16.600
 Because when you think about it,

1:59:16.600 --> 1:59:20.160
 a one in 20 chance for your first phase three study,

1:59:20.160 --> 1:59:23.200
 a one in 20 chance for your second phase three study,

1:59:23.200 --> 1:59:28.120
 you multiply that together, it's one in 400, 0.025.

1:59:28.120 --> 1:59:32.680
 So that's pretty good.

1:59:32.680 --> 1:59:35.760
 So robust 0.001 is even better

1:59:35.760 --> 1:59:40.080
 than two independent phase three studies, each at 0.05.

1:59:41.160 --> 1:59:45.600
 What we ended up getting was one in 10,000, 0.0001.

1:59:46.560 --> 1:59:49.400
 Outrageous, incredibly.

1:59:49.400 --> 1:59:51.440
 So that's a measure of both the difference

1:59:51.440 --> 1:59:53.560
 between the two groups and the variability.

1:59:53.560 --> 1:59:58.560
 And so what it meant is that we had minimal variability,

1:59:58.600 --> 2:00:00.400
 that most people who got the MDA

2:00:00.400 --> 2:00:03.480
 got quite a large amount of benefit from it.

2:00:03.480 --> 2:00:05.160
 And most people who got the placebo

2:00:05.160 --> 2:00:07.320
 were more or less in the same range as well.

2:00:07.320 --> 2:00:08.920
 That's really exciting, by the way.

2:00:08.920 --> 2:00:13.520
 I mean, I suppose it's exciting

2:00:13.520 --> 2:00:16.440
 from a perspective of approval by the FDA.

2:00:16.440 --> 2:00:18.280
 Maybe perhaps that's the way you're seeing it,

2:00:18.280 --> 2:00:22.960
 but it's also exciting because it has a chance

2:00:22.960 --> 2:00:26.000
 to help people that are truly suffering, yeah.

2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:29.040
 Well, if we can get one in 10,000

2:00:29.040 --> 2:00:31.360
 in the first phase three study,

2:00:31.360 --> 2:00:34.440
 chances are we can get one in 20 in the second.

2:00:34.440 --> 2:00:36.960
 So it's really gonna be about safety for us

2:00:36.960 --> 2:00:38.520
 in the second phase three study.

2:00:39.800 --> 2:00:44.800
 Now, you can have a large P value, a large significance,

2:00:45.720 --> 2:00:49.720
 but you could have an effect that's not very significant.

2:00:49.720 --> 2:00:51.160
 It's not clinically significant.

2:00:51.160 --> 2:00:52.840
 You can have statistical significance

2:00:52.840 --> 2:00:55.400
 without clinical significance.

2:00:55.400 --> 2:00:58.040
 And as I said, the more people you get in the study,

2:00:58.040 --> 2:00:59.960
 you can find smaller and smaller differences

2:00:59.960 --> 2:01:01.120
 between two groups.

2:01:02.040 --> 2:01:07.040
 Now, we showed that we had a very large effect size.

2:01:07.320 --> 2:01:10.280
 So effect size is based on...

2:01:10.280 --> 2:01:11.480
 That scale you mentioned?

2:01:11.480 --> 2:01:13.560
 Well, the scale of the effect size

2:01:13.560 --> 2:01:17.320
 is based on standard deviations.

2:01:17.320 --> 2:01:20.400
 So an effect size of one means that your results

2:01:20.400 --> 2:01:23.320
 are one standard deviation away from the norm.

2:01:23.320 --> 2:01:25.000
 That's considered very large.

2:01:26.320 --> 2:01:31.320
 The SSRIs, because they were like 0.3, 0.4 effect size,

2:01:32.240 --> 2:01:34.120
 that's considered small effect size.

2:01:34.120 --> 2:01:36.920
 Medium is starting to be around 0.6

2:01:36.920 --> 2:01:40.040
 and 0.8 and above are large effect sizes.

2:01:41.400 --> 2:01:45.680
 We had what's called placebo subtracted effect size.

2:01:45.680 --> 2:01:46.880
 There's two different ways to look at it.

2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:49.440
 Placebo subtracted means you kind of look at the difference

2:01:49.440 --> 2:01:50.720
 between your two groups.

2:01:51.600 --> 2:01:54.480
 And what that is for us, since one group had therapy

2:01:54.480 --> 2:01:56.240
 and one had therapy plus MDMA,

2:01:56.240 --> 2:01:58.880
 the placebo subtracted effect size

2:01:58.880 --> 2:02:01.120
 is basically the effect of just the MDMA

2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:03.600
 because you've kind of washed out the therapy.

2:02:03.600 --> 2:02:05.240
 That was 0.91.

2:02:05.240 --> 2:02:08.440
 So we had a large effect size, which was different.

2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:13.040
 Wow, so 0.91 over just the therapy, so over the placebo.

2:02:13.040 --> 2:02:13.960
 Yeah. Wow.

2:02:13.960 --> 2:02:17.440
 Now, when we do the within group,

2:02:17.440 --> 2:02:21.560
 meaning the group that just got the MDMA plus therapy,

2:02:21.560 --> 2:02:23.920
 look at their baseline and their outcomes.

2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:25.320
 That's another way to look at it.

2:02:25.320 --> 2:02:27.440
 And that's what's gonna actually happen in practice

2:02:27.440 --> 2:02:30.880
 because people are gonna get MDMA plus therapy.

2:02:30.880 --> 2:02:32.680
 That's 2.1 effect size.

2:02:32.680 --> 2:02:35.000
 Two standard deviations away from the norm

2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:36.600
 is enormous effect size.

2:02:38.200 --> 2:02:43.200
 The other part is that we had no effect by site,

2:02:44.040 --> 2:02:44.960
 which is very important.

2:02:44.960 --> 2:02:47.720
 So we had 15 sites, two in Israel, two in Canada,

2:02:47.720 --> 2:02:49.520
 11 throughout the United States.

2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:53.320
 The FDA looks at, is there a side effect?

2:02:53.320 --> 2:02:54.600
 Because what that might mean is

2:02:54.600 --> 2:02:56.280
 maybe you've got all your patients

2:02:56.280 --> 2:02:58.240
 or most of your patients going to this one site,

2:02:58.240 --> 2:03:01.000
 which is these highly experienced therapists

2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:03.160
 and they're like hippies from way back

2:03:03.160 --> 2:03:05.120
 and they're super experienced with psychedelics

2:03:05.120 --> 2:03:07.360
 and they're getting great results,

2:03:07.360 --> 2:03:09.240
 but nobody else gets good results.

2:03:09.240 --> 2:03:11.080
 So we had no effect by site.

2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:12.320
 That's incredible.

2:03:12.320 --> 2:03:14.920
 That we've been able to train all these new therapists.

2:03:14.920 --> 2:03:19.920
 We had about 80 therapists working at all these 15 sites.

2:03:20.320 --> 2:03:23.560
 We also discovered that there's a group

2:03:23.560 --> 2:03:26.960
 that's considered to be very difficult to treat,

2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:29.960
 which is called the dissociative subtype.

2:03:29.960 --> 2:03:32.960
 So when people are traumatized,

2:03:32.960 --> 2:03:37.720
 one of the ways to psychologically survive that

2:03:37.720 --> 2:03:38.960
 is you dissociate.

2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:41.040
 It's like you're not there.

2:03:41.040 --> 2:03:43.480
 When you do that though, it's hard to come back

2:03:43.480 --> 2:03:45.000
 because when you come back,

2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:47.520
 then you get all these painful memories and fearful.

2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:50.320
 And so the extreme of that

2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:53.120
 is called dissociative identity disorder,

2:03:53.120 --> 2:03:56.440
 kind of like schizophrenia, almost dissociative identity.

2:03:56.440 --> 2:04:01.080
 So we let people in who are on the dissociative subtype

2:04:01.080 --> 2:04:03.120
 and those are considered to be the hardest to treat

2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:07.720
 because the theory is that you need to be ego intact.

2:04:07.720 --> 2:04:10.200
 As I said, the mystical experience is not correlated

2:04:10.200 --> 2:04:11.240
 with therapeutic outcomes.

2:04:11.240 --> 2:04:13.800
 And you need to be talking about what traumatized you

2:04:13.800 --> 2:04:15.800
 and working through that and expressing it,

2:04:15.800 --> 2:04:18.000
 letting it out, not keeping it in.

2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:22.520
 So the dissociative subtype seems like it's harder

2:04:22.520 --> 2:04:24.480
 for them to get back into the event

2:04:24.480 --> 2:04:26.240
 because they're so dissociated.

2:04:26.240 --> 2:04:29.040
 What we showed is that those people did even better

2:04:29.040 --> 2:04:31.400
 on average than everybody else.

2:04:31.400 --> 2:04:33.200
 So that MDMA is integrative.

2:04:33.200 --> 2:04:36.920
 It helps people who are so separate

2:04:36.920 --> 2:04:39.080
 that they make even more rapid progress.

2:04:39.080 --> 2:04:41.960
 So it's almost like the MDMA made it more difficult

2:04:41.960 --> 2:04:43.440
 for them to dissociate.

2:04:43.440 --> 2:04:44.280
 Yes.

2:04:44.280 --> 2:04:45.760
 Yeah, or you could say it made it easier

2:04:45.760 --> 2:04:47.200
 for them to remember.

2:04:47.200 --> 2:04:48.280
 Yes, exactly.

2:04:48.280 --> 2:04:49.520
 To reverse the dissociation.

2:04:49.520 --> 2:04:50.360
 Yeah.

2:04:50.360 --> 2:04:53.560
 And we find that MDMA enhances memory for the trauma

2:04:54.600 --> 2:04:57.600
 so that you can have these unconscious memories

2:04:57.600 --> 2:04:59.440
 or memories that you cannot remember

2:04:59.440 --> 2:05:00.920
 or that you've suppressed so much,

2:05:00.920 --> 2:05:02.560
 but they distort your view.

2:05:02.560 --> 2:05:04.720
 Your filter of the world is distorted

2:05:04.720 --> 2:05:07.400
 by these fearful memories that the world can't be trusted.

2:05:07.400 --> 2:05:08.400
 People can't be trusted.

2:05:08.400 --> 2:05:10.040
 It's always about to happen.

2:05:10.040 --> 2:05:13.640
 So we find that MDMA increases memory for the trauma,

2:05:13.640 --> 2:05:15.280
 but by reducing the fear,

2:05:15.280 --> 2:05:16.880
 then the memories can come to the surface.

2:05:16.880 --> 2:05:18.960
 Then you can process them, let out the emotions,

2:05:18.960 --> 2:05:21.480
 cry, scream, shake, whatever.

2:05:21.480 --> 2:05:24.480
 And then through this MDMA effect

2:05:24.480 --> 2:05:26.040
 on the amygdala and the hippocampus,

2:05:26.040 --> 2:05:29.400
 it helps you store these memories into longterm storage

2:05:29.400 --> 2:05:31.320
 so that they're not always about to happen.

2:05:31.320 --> 2:05:32.600
 They're in the past.

2:05:32.600 --> 2:05:35.320
 They're part of your story, but they're not the whole story.

2:05:35.320 --> 2:05:38.640
 So we discovered that the dissociative subtype works better.

2:05:38.640 --> 2:05:42.800
 Now, none of this would be enough unless safety.

2:05:42.800 --> 2:05:45.000
 So from a safety perspective,

2:05:45.000 --> 2:05:48.040
 what we discovered is that there was one woman in the study

2:05:48.040 --> 2:05:52.040
 that attempted to kill herself twice during the study.

2:05:52.040 --> 2:05:57.040
 There was another woman that was so worried

2:05:57.200 --> 2:05:58.400
 that she might kill herself,

2:05:58.400 --> 2:06:00.480
 that the therapy brought these things to the surface

2:06:00.480 --> 2:06:01.600
 that she's been pushing away,

2:06:01.600 --> 2:06:03.920
 that she checked herself into a hospital

2:06:03.920 --> 2:06:05.720
 in order to avoid self harm.

2:06:06.800 --> 2:06:08.200
 At the end of the study,

2:06:08.200 --> 2:06:11.840
 what we learned is both of them were in the placebo group.

2:06:11.840 --> 2:06:14.280
 We didn't have anybody in the MDMA group

2:06:14.280 --> 2:06:15.720
 attempt to kill themselves.

2:06:16.920 --> 2:06:21.080
 So the MDMA is really helpful

2:06:21.080 --> 2:06:23.200
 for giving people a sense of hope

2:06:24.160 --> 2:06:27.120
 and that they can somehow process this.

2:06:27.120 --> 2:06:30.800
 Now, it's not to say that nobody will ever commit suicide.

2:06:30.800 --> 2:06:34.200
 That's our big concern in the second phase three study.

2:06:34.200 --> 2:06:36.000
 As I said, it's more gonna be about safety

2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:37.000
 than about efficacy.

2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:38.360
 We think we'll get the efficacy,

2:06:38.360 --> 2:06:42.200
 but we're very concerned about safety.

2:06:42.200 --> 2:06:46.320
 Because we had problems in the first phase three study

2:06:46.320 --> 2:06:47.760
 of somebody trying to kill herself twice

2:06:47.760 --> 2:06:48.760
 in the placebo group,

2:06:49.960 --> 2:06:52.920
 it's the background for having PTSD.

2:06:52.920 --> 2:06:55.480
 So there'd have to be a disproportionate number of people

2:06:55.480 --> 2:06:57.400
 in the MDMA group try to kill themselves

2:06:57.400 --> 2:06:58.800
 or succeed in killing themselves

2:06:58.800 --> 2:07:01.440
 than in the placebo group for the FDA to say,

2:07:01.440 --> 2:07:04.320
 oh, this MDMA, it's too dangerous.

2:07:04.320 --> 2:07:05.920
 We don't think that's gonna happen.

2:07:05.920 --> 2:07:10.920
 So the other findings from safety

2:07:11.120 --> 2:07:13.240
 is that the side effects are transitory.

2:07:13.240 --> 2:07:17.760
 They're minor, they're sweating or jaw clenching

2:07:17.760 --> 2:07:19.760
 or a slight temperature increase.

2:07:19.760 --> 2:07:23.040
 And everybody that's been to a rave knows about it.

2:07:23.040 --> 2:07:26.200
 Take an ecstasy, there are some side effects.

2:07:26.200 --> 2:07:27.640
 But they're minor, they're transitory

2:07:27.640 --> 2:07:30.920
 and there has been this massive problem

2:07:30.920 --> 2:07:33.440
 of during the eighties, the nineties,

2:07:33.440 --> 2:07:34.920
 NIDA, the National Institute on Drug Abuse

2:07:34.920 --> 2:07:37.760
 was trying to say that MDMA was neurotoxic

2:07:37.760 --> 2:07:38.840
 and that you take it

2:07:38.840 --> 2:07:41.200
 and it's gonna cause nerve terminal degeneration.

2:07:41.200 --> 2:07:42.960
 It's gonna be major brain damage.

2:07:42.960 --> 2:07:45.400
 It's gonna be significant functional consequences.

2:07:45.400 --> 2:07:48.520
 And back then they were saying that MDMA is too dangerous.

2:07:48.520 --> 2:07:49.960
 It should never even be researched.

2:07:49.960 --> 2:07:51.400
 Nobody should even get it once

2:07:51.400 --> 2:07:54.120
 because it's poison and brain damage.

2:07:54.120 --> 2:07:57.560
 Well, we no longer believe that, that was exaggerated.

2:07:57.560 --> 2:08:00.840
 That was in service of the drug war.

2:08:00.840 --> 2:08:04.520
 But we've done in phase two neurocognitive tests

2:08:04.520 --> 2:08:07.320
 before and after in two of our different sites

2:08:07.320 --> 2:08:09.880
 and showed no decline in cognitive functioning.

2:08:09.880 --> 2:08:14.680
 So we don't think that there's any neurotoxicity happening

2:08:14.680 --> 2:08:16.760
 and the doses that we use.

2:08:16.760 --> 2:08:18.800
 There's no obvious functional consequences.

2:08:18.800 --> 2:08:20.240
 People are getting better.

2:08:20.240 --> 2:08:24.160
 And the other thing that we've learned in phase two

2:08:24.160 --> 2:08:25.720
 and that we still have to learn from this study.

2:08:25.720 --> 2:08:29.400
 So what we showed is the durability of the effect.

2:08:29.400 --> 2:08:32.160
 We showed that 32% of the people

2:08:32.160 --> 2:08:34.440
 that got the therapy without MDMA

2:08:34.440 --> 2:08:36.880
 at two months after the last experimental session

2:08:36.880 --> 2:08:38.840
 no longer had PTSD.

2:08:38.840 --> 2:08:41.160
 Just with the therapy, which is phenomenal

2:08:41.160 --> 2:08:44.200
 because these are on average 14 years PTSD,

2:08:44.200 --> 2:08:46.320
 one third had PTSD over 20 years.

2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:51.120
 And just with the therapy,

2:08:51.120 --> 2:08:54.640
 32% no longer had PTSD at the two months.

2:08:54.640 --> 2:08:58.440
 However, those people that got MDMA, it was 67%.

2:08:58.440 --> 2:09:02.320
 No longer had PTSD, more than twice as good.

2:09:02.320 --> 2:09:04.840
 In phase two and in phase three,

2:09:04.840 --> 2:09:07.600
 we're also gonna do the 12 month followup.

2:09:07.600 --> 2:09:09.320
 That's not for the FDA.

2:09:09.320 --> 2:09:10.760
 That's not for approvability.

2:09:10.760 --> 2:09:12.400
 That's more for insurance companies

2:09:12.400 --> 2:09:15.360
 because this is expensive, a lot of therapy time.

2:09:15.360 --> 2:09:18.080
 If it fades, if it's great results initially

2:09:18.080 --> 2:09:20.880
 but then it fades after six months, what's the point?

2:09:20.880 --> 2:09:24.880
 And what we showed in phase two

2:09:24.880 --> 2:09:28.960
 is that people keep getting better.

2:09:28.960 --> 2:09:31.960
 At the two month followup, they're doing pretty well

2:09:31.960 --> 2:09:34.960
 but at the 12 month followup, they're even better.

2:09:34.960 --> 2:09:35.960
 So it's durable.

2:09:35.960 --> 2:09:38.440
 People have learned how to process trauma.

2:09:38.440 --> 2:09:39.280
 They keep getting better.

2:09:39.280 --> 2:09:41.680
 So we've not reached that point in this phase three study

2:09:41.680 --> 2:09:43.440
 where everybody's got their one year followup.

2:09:43.440 --> 2:09:46.320
 But we have also done three and a half year followups

2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:48.840
 to some of the groups that were in phase two

2:09:48.840 --> 2:09:50.600
 and showed that it was durable.

2:09:50.600 --> 2:09:53.040
 And we're doing a long term followup now

2:09:53.040 --> 2:09:55.280
 to many of the people in phase two,

2:09:55.280 --> 2:09:57.640
 some of them treated 15 years ago.

2:09:57.640 --> 2:09:59.960
 So that's all more for the insurance companies.

2:09:59.960 --> 2:10:02.800
 So basically what we found in the paper

2:10:02.800 --> 2:10:05.360
 that we just published is that it was highly efficacious,

2:10:05.360 --> 2:10:07.920
 highly significant, no effect by sight,

2:10:07.920 --> 2:10:12.280
 works in the hardest cases and the safety record was great.

2:10:13.120 --> 2:10:14.640
 That's an incredible success.

2:10:14.640 --> 2:10:17.640
 And that's really exciting, especially given

2:10:17.640 --> 2:10:21.720
 that the people who've committed, who attempted

2:10:21.720 --> 2:10:23.920
 to commit suicide were let into the study.

2:10:23.920 --> 2:10:26.800
 And so these are people who are truly suffering.

2:10:30.120 --> 2:10:35.120
 I mean, that's incredibly exciting.

2:10:36.120 --> 2:10:38.360
 And I mean, just to speak to the frustration

2:10:38.360 --> 2:10:39.920
 why things can't move faster,

2:10:39.920 --> 2:10:44.920
 but for what it is, it's incredibly exciting.

2:10:44.920 --> 2:10:48.160
 Is there other studies of this nature

2:10:48.160 --> 2:10:51.160
 that you foresee enabling that same kind

2:10:51.160 --> 2:10:53.480
 of positive impact, whether it's MDMA

2:10:53.480 --> 2:10:55.360
 for other things like treating addiction,

2:10:55.360 --> 2:10:59.400
 or maybe it's psilocybin for other conditions?

2:10:59.400 --> 2:11:01.160
 Is there something else that's promising?

2:11:01.160 --> 2:11:05.800
 Yeah, I think that what we've discovered

2:11:05.800 --> 2:11:08.920
 I don't think is unique to MDMA.

2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:12.360
 So it's MDMA assisted psychotherapy.

2:11:12.360 --> 2:11:15.560
 MDMA is ideal for PTSD.

2:11:15.560 --> 2:11:18.920
 Maybe it won't work as well for OCD or other things.

2:11:18.920 --> 2:11:21.040
 It was very strategic why we chose MDMA

2:11:21.040 --> 2:11:22.720
 and why we chose PTSD.

2:11:23.640 --> 2:11:26.400
 But I don't think that the results that we've got

2:11:26.400 --> 2:11:29.160
 are so unique to MDMA assisted therapy.

2:11:29.160 --> 2:11:31.320
 I think that psilocybin assisted therapy

2:11:31.320 --> 2:11:33.720
 is gonna be great for people

2:11:33.720 --> 2:11:35.560
 with life threatening illnesses,

2:11:35.560 --> 2:11:37.920
 cancer who are anxious about dying.

2:11:37.920 --> 2:11:39.480
 It looks like it's really good

2:11:39.480 --> 2:11:41.040
 in the treatment of addiction.

2:11:41.040 --> 2:11:44.480
 Again, these are in combination

2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:47.120
 with sort of the psilocybin tobacco

2:11:47.120 --> 2:11:49.920
 is cognitive behavioral therapy with psilocybin.

2:11:51.480 --> 2:11:54.000
 I think that it's gonna be a little bit more difficult,

2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:55.680
 psilocybin for depression.

2:11:55.680 --> 2:11:58.400
 I don't know if it'll be quite as good.

2:11:58.400 --> 2:12:01.880
 There are some biological aspects sometimes to depression,

2:12:01.880 --> 2:12:03.480
 but I think that there'll be really good results

2:12:03.480 --> 2:12:04.880
 for psilocybin for depression.

2:12:04.880 --> 2:12:05.960
 I think it'll be approved.

2:12:05.960 --> 2:12:09.080
 It's considered a breakthrough therapy by the FDA.

2:12:09.080 --> 2:12:12.320
 Ibogaine is phenomenal for opiate addiction,

2:12:12.320 --> 2:12:14.000
 helping people go through withdrawal

2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:15.800
 and then giving them this chance

2:12:15.800 --> 2:12:20.800
 to deal with the material that drives them for addiction.

2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:23.600
 There was Ben Sessa, Dr. Ben Sessa in England

2:12:23.600 --> 2:12:26.440
 did MDMA for alcohol use disorder.

2:12:26.440 --> 2:12:28.640
 And that was really great, the results he got.

2:12:28.640 --> 2:12:31.760
 And it's the case that he ended up

2:12:31.760 --> 2:12:33.440
 basically treating people for trauma.

2:12:33.440 --> 2:12:35.320
 It's the trauma that people run,

2:12:35.320 --> 2:12:37.680
 the emotional challenges that people run from

2:12:37.680 --> 2:12:42.680
 into quieting that pain through drug addiction or alcoholism.

2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:44.960
 So trauma is behind a lot of addiction.

2:12:44.960 --> 2:12:49.960
 I think that we are going to see a revolution in psychiatry

2:12:50.680 --> 2:12:54.760
 and that there will be a lot of conditions

2:12:54.760 --> 2:12:59.320
 that have left a lot of people still suffering

2:12:59.320 --> 2:13:01.240
 that psychedelic assisted therapy,

2:13:01.240 --> 2:13:03.080
 different psychedelics, different approaches.

2:13:03.080 --> 2:13:06.360
 But I think that we will see a lot of hope

2:13:06.360 --> 2:13:08.040
 for psychiatry and psychotherapy

2:13:08.040 --> 2:13:09.720
 and that psychedelics would be a big part

2:13:09.720 --> 2:13:13.680
 of changing the practice of psychiatry and psychotherapy.

2:13:13.680 --> 2:13:15.820
 Yeah, this is really to me fascinating.

2:13:15.820 --> 2:13:19.180
 So I actually, when I was younger,

2:13:19.180 --> 2:13:21.920
 for the longest time, wanted to be a psychiatrist.

2:13:21.920 --> 2:13:24.740
 So I was excited by psychotherapy,

2:13:24.740 --> 2:13:28.160
 but then I perhaps incorrectly, maybe you can correct me,

2:13:28.160 --> 2:13:30.600
 but became more and more cynical

2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:33.520
 because it felt like it was more about prescribing drugs

2:13:33.520 --> 2:13:34.560
 than psychotherapy.

2:13:34.560 --> 2:13:36.360
 I'm not going to correct you.

2:13:36.360 --> 2:13:39.760
 I mean, right now, there is a crisis in psychiatry

2:13:39.760 --> 2:13:42.440
 that there are so many psychiatrists that are so fed up

2:13:42.440 --> 2:13:45.740
 because they have been pharmaceuticalized.

2:13:45.740 --> 2:13:47.400
 They meet people for 15 minutes,

2:13:47.400 --> 2:13:49.200
 they adjust their medications.

2:13:49.200 --> 2:13:51.360
 This is the way they make the most money,

2:13:51.360 --> 2:13:53.760
 but they've lost the art of talking to people.

2:13:55.760 --> 2:13:58.600
 And that's why we see that so many young psychiatric

2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:02.920
 residents are so thrilled by psychedelics

2:14:02.920 --> 2:14:05.640
 that they really want to get back to treating people

2:14:05.640 --> 2:14:08.320
 as individuals, not just a bunch of chemicals.

2:14:08.320 --> 2:14:09.600
 Yeah, that's truly fascinating.

2:14:09.600 --> 2:14:11.640
 Because the reason it was appealing to me,

2:14:11.640 --> 2:14:14.760
 it was a way to study the human mind

2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:18.400
 and to see ways through talking

2:14:18.400 --> 2:14:22.720
 that you can make people feel better,

2:14:23.600 --> 2:14:28.000
 make people better, make people suffer less.

2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:30.920
 And that was really exciting at the time.

2:14:30.920 --> 2:14:33.680
 I ended up then going to AI because then

2:14:33.680 --> 2:14:35.680
 I can understand the mind from that angle.

2:14:35.680 --> 2:14:39.920
 But it's exciting that that could be also

2:14:42.120 --> 2:14:43.900
 revolutionized the field of psychotherapy,

2:14:43.900 --> 2:14:47.040
 take it from its back to its origins,

2:14:47.040 --> 2:14:51.160
 to where a psychiatrist would be a scholar of the mind.

2:14:51.160 --> 2:14:53.880
 Yeah, well, Freud talked about dreams

2:14:53.880 --> 2:14:56.440
 as the railroad to the unconscious.

2:14:56.440 --> 2:14:57.600
 And there was a lot of,

2:14:57.600 --> 2:15:00.920
 you really spent a lot of time with people.

2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:05.800
 Now, right before he died, in his last book,

2:15:05.800 --> 2:15:07.580
 Freud wrote something, and again,

2:15:07.580 --> 2:15:09.400
 this will be a rough paraphrase,

2:15:09.400 --> 2:15:11.520
 but he said that in the future,

2:15:11.520 --> 2:15:15.680
 we may learn about the energies of the brain

2:15:15.680 --> 2:15:18.480
 and there'll be ways with chemicals to influence that

2:15:18.480 --> 2:15:21.880
 that will help the therapeutic process.

2:15:21.880 --> 2:15:22.720
 Yeah.

2:15:22.720 --> 2:15:27.720
 So you could say he was ahead of his time.

2:15:27.760 --> 2:15:28.600
 Yeah.

2:15:28.600 --> 2:15:32.440
 This study paints a fascinating picture of a future

2:15:33.600 --> 2:15:35.760
 where first for medical applications,

2:15:35.760 --> 2:15:39.300
 but then also in general, psychedelics of various forms

2:15:39.300 --> 2:15:42.300
 could be used by the broader society.

2:15:42.300 --> 2:15:44.540
 Forgive the perhaps ridiculous question,

2:15:44.540 --> 2:15:49.540
 but if much of society, including our politicians,

2:15:49.540 --> 2:15:54.540
 are taking psychedelics and dissolving their ego

2:15:56.500 --> 2:15:58.460
 and going through this whole process,

2:15:58.460 --> 2:16:01.940
 how do you think the world may look different

2:16:01.940 --> 2:16:04.740
 in 20, 30, 50 years?

2:16:04.740 --> 2:16:08.100
 Ah, okay, so I said that I think

2:16:08.100 --> 2:16:11.040
 licensed legalization happens in 2035.

2:16:11.040 --> 2:16:11.880
 Yes.

2:16:12.860 --> 2:16:17.860
 And I think by 2050, we will have enough people,

2:16:17.860 --> 2:16:20.920
 hopefully, spiritualized.

2:16:22.100 --> 2:16:23.600
 We're also talking about,

2:16:24.680 --> 2:16:27.280
 we hear so much in terms of climate change

2:16:27.280 --> 2:16:29.980
 about net zero carbon.

2:16:29.980 --> 2:16:33.020
 So our goal is net zero trauma.

2:16:33.020 --> 2:16:35.700
 When do we have a world with net zero trauma?

2:16:35.700 --> 2:16:39.580
 I mean, right now, we have two sites in Israel.

2:16:39.580 --> 2:16:41.220
 So we help a few people,

2:16:41.220 --> 2:16:44.820
 but the recent war with Gaza has traumatized

2:16:44.820 --> 2:16:46.800
 millions of people on both sides.

2:16:46.800 --> 2:16:50.880
 So we are a long way away from net zero trauma.

2:16:52.060 --> 2:16:56.360
 But that's the hope, and that's, I think, possible.

2:16:56.360 --> 2:16:58.640
 I think humanity as a whole

2:17:01.460 --> 2:17:04.620
 is like lemmings heading over a cliff

2:17:04.620 --> 2:17:09.620
 with climate change and with the nuclear proliferation

2:17:09.660 --> 2:17:11.740
 and just the religious hatreds

2:17:11.740 --> 2:17:13.940
 and the more the retreat to authoritarianism

2:17:13.940 --> 2:17:17.120
 and fundamentalism and tribalism.

2:17:17.120 --> 2:17:20.020
 So I think that there's a very good chance, though,

2:17:20.020 --> 2:17:22.700
 that psychedelics used wisely.

2:17:22.700 --> 2:17:25.060
 So it's not just make psychedelics legal

2:17:25.060 --> 2:17:26.380
 and everybody takes them,

2:17:26.380 --> 2:17:28.420
 as you talked about Ted Kaczynski.

2:17:28.420 --> 2:17:31.260
 It's the context that people take it in.

2:17:31.260 --> 2:17:35.340
 But I think that there's a reasonable chance

2:17:35.340 --> 2:17:37.340
 that enough people can,

2:17:38.320 --> 2:17:42.420
 sort of, you could say, clean their filters

2:17:42.420 --> 2:17:47.420
 to see people as more similar to them than different,

2:17:48.620 --> 2:17:50.500
 not to label them as the enemy.

2:17:50.500 --> 2:17:52.460
 Stan Groff, again, had this beautiful phrase

2:17:52.460 --> 2:17:56.580
 about transparent to the transcendent.

2:17:56.580 --> 2:18:00.380
 That's what, so for our ego,

2:18:00.380 --> 2:18:02.900
 can we be transparent to the transcendent?

2:18:02.900 --> 2:18:05.800
 Can the filter that we look through the world at

2:18:05.800 --> 2:18:08.420
 be cleaned to, you could say,

2:18:08.420 --> 2:18:10.460
 cleansing the doors of perception?

2:18:10.460 --> 2:18:12.500
 Can it be cleaned to the point where we can see

2:18:12.500 --> 2:18:15.880
 the humanity in everybody and see that,

2:18:17.420 --> 2:18:19.580
 one way to say this is that,

2:18:19.580 --> 2:18:21.180
 can we get to the point where religions

2:18:21.180 --> 2:18:23.260
 are seen as like languages?

2:18:23.260 --> 2:18:25.880
 Where we all have this need to communicate,

2:18:25.880 --> 2:18:28.500
 there's thousands of different languages,

2:18:28.500 --> 2:18:29.820
 we don't say that this language

2:18:29.820 --> 2:18:32.220
 is fundamentally better than this language,

2:18:32.220 --> 2:18:33.620
 this language is the only right language,

2:18:33.620 --> 2:18:34.960
 everybody must speak English

2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:38.020
 and Russian is bad or German is better.

2:18:38.020 --> 2:18:41.060
 Maybe we'll get to that point that religions are like that,

2:18:41.060 --> 2:18:42.700
 that there are different cultural backgrounds,

2:18:42.700 --> 2:18:44.020
 different symbol systems,

2:18:44.020 --> 2:18:47.060
 different saints and heroes and messiahs and all this,

2:18:47.060 --> 2:18:50.060
 but that, yeah, Jesus is the son of God,

2:18:50.060 --> 2:18:51.540
 but so is everybody.

2:18:52.380 --> 2:18:55.860
 Or the Jews are the chosen people, but so is everybody.

2:18:55.860 --> 2:18:57.540
 So can we get there?

2:18:57.540 --> 2:18:59.380
 I think that we can.

2:18:59.380 --> 2:19:00.980
 And I think that we need to,

2:19:00.980 --> 2:19:03.900
 to survive the challenges that we're facing.

2:19:03.900 --> 2:19:08.100
 And the hope is that by bringing psychedelics

2:19:08.100 --> 2:19:13.100
 as tools forward and trying to bring the context around them

2:19:14.140 --> 2:19:15.720
 to be one of responsibility

2:19:15.720 --> 2:19:18.580
 rather than just profit maximization

2:19:18.580 --> 2:19:20.680
 and just get as many people to do them

2:19:20.680 --> 2:19:22.540
 from all these for profit companies,

2:19:23.460 --> 2:19:26.620
 can we, and then also drug policy reform

2:19:26.620 --> 2:19:28.420
 and embed knowledge in the society,

2:19:28.420 --> 2:19:31.060
 can we get to honest drug education?

2:19:31.060 --> 2:19:36.060
 DARE, the Drug Awareness Resistance Education,

2:19:36.580 --> 2:19:39.140
 is fundamentally twisted.

2:19:39.140 --> 2:19:42.780
 But it's the program that's used in a lot of schools now.

2:19:42.780 --> 2:19:44.620
 So can we get honest drug education,

2:19:44.620 --> 2:19:47.060
 pure drugs, harm reduction,

2:19:47.060 --> 2:19:49.340
 and knowledge about therapeutic uses

2:19:49.340 --> 2:19:51.860
 and on the one hand,

2:19:51.860 --> 2:19:54.420
 and more of these thousands of psychedelic clinics?

2:19:55.420 --> 2:19:59.100
 I'm hopeful and that's our goal.

2:19:59.100 --> 2:20:04.020
 But in this landscape of pharma companies,

2:20:04.020 --> 2:20:05.820
 they make a lot of money.

2:20:05.820 --> 2:20:07.820
 Some people are worried about the impact

2:20:07.820 --> 2:20:10.740
 of those, you know, of big pharma

2:20:10.740 --> 2:20:13.020
 on the landscape of human trauma.

2:20:13.020 --> 2:20:14.100
 Yeah, yeah.

2:20:14.100 --> 2:20:17.540
 So there's, of course, some companies could do good,

2:20:17.540 --> 2:20:20.100
 but that's not inherent,

2:20:20.100 --> 2:20:24.780
 like many of these companies are not optimizing for good,

2:20:24.780 --> 2:20:26.380
 they're optimizing for profit.

2:20:26.380 --> 2:20:27.460
 Exactly, exactly.

2:20:27.460 --> 2:20:31.860
 Does this rise of for profit pharma companies worry you?

2:20:31.860 --> 2:20:33.660
 How do you navigate it?

2:20:33.660 --> 2:20:35.580
 Do we still have for profit companies

2:20:35.580 --> 2:20:39.460
 that basically do what MAPS does,

2:20:39.460 --> 2:20:41.420
 which is like fight the good fight

2:20:41.420 --> 2:20:42.820
 for the benefit of humanity?

2:20:42.820 --> 2:20:45.420
 Like how do we proceed in this,

2:20:45.420 --> 2:20:49.580
 in landscape where drugs can make a lot of money?

2:20:49.580 --> 2:20:52.100
 Well, I am concerned.

2:20:52.100 --> 2:20:55.660
 Overall, I think the rise of the for profit companies,

2:20:55.660 --> 2:20:58.460
 we have to realize is a sign of success,

2:20:58.460 --> 2:21:03.460
 that we have overcome the regulatory prohibitions,

2:21:04.260 --> 2:21:06.620
 we've overcome a lot of the public attitudes

2:21:06.620 --> 2:21:09.780
 that are against it, we've demonstrated some success.

2:21:09.780 --> 2:21:12.140
 So the rise of the for profit companies

2:21:12.140 --> 2:21:13.940
 are a sign of the progress that we've made.

2:21:13.940 --> 2:21:15.860
 On the other hand, turning things over

2:21:15.860 --> 2:21:17.780
 to profit maximizing companies,

2:21:19.100 --> 2:21:20.980
 the big concern is that they're gonna try

2:21:20.980 --> 2:21:24.900
 to minimize the amount of therapy

2:21:24.900 --> 2:21:26.740
 and make it so the cost is less,

2:21:26.740 --> 2:21:28.940
 so insurance companies are more likely to cover it

2:21:28.940 --> 2:21:31.140
 and then that they just sell the most drugs.

2:21:32.060 --> 2:21:34.500
 The other thing we've seen as an example of this

2:21:34.500 --> 2:21:37.740
 is S ketamine by Johnson and Johnson for depression.

2:21:37.740 --> 2:21:40.700
 And it's done by a profit maximizing company.

2:21:40.700 --> 2:21:43.180
 They don't know anything about psychedelic psychotherapy

2:21:43.180 --> 2:21:44.900
 or psychotherapy at all.

2:21:44.900 --> 2:21:48.460
 And so they've gotten approval for S ketamine

2:21:48.460 --> 2:21:51.980
 on the basis of it's just a pharmacological treatment

2:21:51.980 --> 2:21:54.980
 and it's not delivered with therapy,

2:21:54.980 --> 2:21:57.100
 the results fade pretty quickly,

2:21:57.100 --> 2:21:59.860
 so you need to get more ketamine.

2:21:59.860 --> 2:22:02.820
 And so it's designed in a way to maximize the profits

2:22:02.820 --> 2:22:04.980
 for the pharmaceutical company,

2:22:04.980 --> 2:22:07.780
 but it doesn't maximize patient outcomes.

2:22:07.780 --> 2:22:10.420
 What we're seeing though in these various clinics

2:22:10.420 --> 2:22:14.100
 that are being set up is that a lot of people are realizing

2:22:14.100 --> 2:22:17.620
 that it works better with therapy.

2:22:17.620 --> 2:22:20.660
 And so the clinics are run by people that are therapists

2:22:20.660 --> 2:22:22.980
 so that when they provide therapy,

2:22:22.980 --> 2:22:26.500
 they're making more money and then you need less ketamine.

2:22:26.500 --> 2:22:31.500
 Also ketamine itself, S ketamine is a isomer of ketamine

2:22:31.540 --> 2:22:33.540
 that's been patented for depression

2:22:33.540 --> 2:22:35.020
 and they sell it for hundreds of dollars,

2:22:35.020 --> 2:22:37.140
 but ketamine itself

2:22:37.140 --> 2:22:39.300
 is one of the world's essential medicines.

2:22:39.300 --> 2:22:41.580
 It's off patent, it's been around for a long time,

2:22:41.580 --> 2:22:44.580
 it was the main battlefield anesthetic in Vietnam.

2:22:44.580 --> 2:22:47.380
 And it's only a few bucks because it's generic.

2:22:47.380 --> 2:22:49.740
 So a lot of the ketamine clinics are saying,

2:22:49.740 --> 2:22:51.860
 great, thank you, Johnson and Johnson,

2:22:51.860 --> 2:22:53.940
 you've helped demonstrate that ketamine is good

2:22:53.940 --> 2:22:56.300
 for depression, but we're not gonna buy it from you.

2:22:56.300 --> 2:22:58.060
 We're gonna buy it for a few bucks

2:22:58.060 --> 2:23:00.660
 and we're gonna add therapy to it.

2:23:00.660 --> 2:23:02.700
 Now there's a bunch of ketamine mills you could say

2:23:02.700 --> 2:23:05.180
 that are just prescribing the ketamine

2:23:05.180 --> 2:23:07.140
 and people are making a lot of money there.

2:23:07.140 --> 2:23:09.380
 So I am worried about that.

2:23:09.380 --> 2:23:11.300
 I think the best thing that we can do

2:23:11.300 --> 2:23:15.620
 is create an alternative narrative,

2:23:15.620 --> 2:23:16.940
 a different kind of example.

2:23:16.940 --> 2:23:18.060
 We can lead by example.

2:23:18.060 --> 2:23:20.300
 We can't make for profit companies

2:23:20.300 --> 2:23:23.620
 into benefit corporations unless they wanna do that.

2:23:23.620 --> 2:23:28.420
 We can't make them to really maximize patient outcomes.

2:23:28.420 --> 2:23:32.500
 But if we create an example of something that's different,

2:23:32.500 --> 2:23:36.100
 the hope is that people will gravitate towards that

2:23:36.100 --> 2:23:37.860
 and some of the other companies.

2:23:37.860 --> 2:23:41.220
 Like even now we have Exxon and other these companies,

2:23:41.220 --> 2:23:42.660
 oil companies saying, oh, we're big

2:23:42.660 --> 2:23:45.860
 into alternative energy and we're, you know.

2:23:45.860 --> 2:23:48.860
 And that starts with companies that show an example

2:23:48.860 --> 2:23:51.060
 that then communicates to the public

2:23:51.060 --> 2:23:53.140
 that this is something exciting

2:23:53.140 --> 2:23:56.380
 and then they demand the same of Exxon and so on.

2:23:56.380 --> 2:23:58.780
 The public demands it and you could say the same thing

2:23:58.780 --> 2:24:03.500
 for the public demanding the big pharma

2:24:03.500 --> 2:24:08.340
 to optimize for benefit versus optimize for profit

2:24:08.340 --> 2:24:11.060
 and maybe giving power to the therapists,

2:24:11.060 --> 2:24:13.540
 more power to the therapists, more power to the doctors

2:24:13.540 --> 2:24:16.420
 that ultimately want.

2:24:16.420 --> 2:24:21.020
 I think incentives are interesting,

2:24:21.020 --> 2:24:25.220
 but I think doctors ultimately care more

2:24:25.220 --> 2:24:27.380
 because they're in direct contact with humans.

2:24:27.380 --> 2:24:29.020
 They want to make people better.

2:24:29.020 --> 2:24:31.340
 It's not, you know, sure they wanna make money,

2:24:31.340 --> 2:24:33.860
 but they ultimately want to make people feel better

2:24:33.860 --> 2:24:35.420
 because they get to look at people

2:24:35.420 --> 2:24:38.460
 and it's so joyful to make people feel better

2:24:38.460 --> 2:24:39.300
 at the end of the day.

2:24:39.300 --> 2:24:43.060
 So giving more power to them is also perhaps

2:24:43.060 --> 2:24:45.940
 one of the ways that you then incentivize

2:24:46.940 --> 2:24:51.660
 the pharma companies that are trying to do good

2:24:51.660 --> 2:24:53.820
 because the doctors will choose those companies.

2:24:53.820 --> 2:24:57.300
 Yeah, now the other part of this is drug policy reform.

2:24:57.300 --> 2:25:00.020
 So that if we make it so that you can buy MDMA

2:25:00.020 --> 2:25:03.140
 for 10 or 20 bucks on your own

2:25:03.140 --> 2:25:06.500
 and we've trained people on here's our therapeutic method,

2:25:06.500 --> 2:25:09.440
 here is our ways for peer support,

2:25:09.440 --> 2:25:13.380
 then people have an alternative from buying it

2:25:13.380 --> 2:25:15.020
 from the pharma companies.

2:25:15.020 --> 2:25:18.340
 So most of the for profit companies

2:25:18.340 --> 2:25:20.300
 have come to this conclusion

2:25:20.300 --> 2:25:24.760
 that drug policy reform is bad for their business model.

2:25:25.580 --> 2:25:28.300
 I think they're making a fundamental mistake.

2:25:28.300 --> 2:25:30.380
 And I think the reason is that

2:25:30.380 --> 2:25:32.300
 the more that we de stigmatize this,

2:25:32.300 --> 2:25:35.720
 the more that we sensitize people to this is an approach,

2:25:35.720 --> 2:25:37.860
 even when people can get it on their own

2:25:37.860 --> 2:25:40.700
 and do it with their friends or do it with themselves,

2:25:40.700 --> 2:25:42.720
 there's gonna be even more people that say,

2:25:42.720 --> 2:25:44.860
 oh my God, I've got real serious issues.

2:25:44.860 --> 2:25:47.780
 I would rather go to trained professionals

2:25:47.780 --> 2:25:49.720
 covered by insurance.

2:25:49.720 --> 2:25:52.580
 And I think it'll increase the business,

2:25:52.580 --> 2:25:56.140
 but most of the for profit companies don't see it that way.

2:25:56.140 --> 2:26:00.780
 And so as a nonprofit that owns a benefit corp,

2:26:00.780 --> 2:26:03.700
 we're not trying to maximize sales or profits.

2:26:03.700 --> 2:26:06.740
 But I do believe that drug policy reform

2:26:06.740 --> 2:26:10.180
 creates this alternative access point for people

2:26:10.180 --> 2:26:12.800
 and that will help keep the for profits in check

2:26:12.800 --> 2:26:15.820
 to some extent as well.

2:26:15.820 --> 2:26:16.660
 I love it.

2:26:18.580 --> 2:26:22.460
 Let's put on your wise visionary hat

2:26:22.460 --> 2:26:25.980
 and ask when you look to young folks,

2:26:25.980 --> 2:26:28.900
 is there advice you can give to young people today,

2:26:28.900 --> 2:26:33.900
 whether in high school or college about career, about life?

2:26:33.900 --> 2:26:36.820
 You've lived quite a nonlinear

2:26:36.820 --> 2:26:39.020
 and fascinating life yourself.

2:26:39.020 --> 2:26:40.220
 Is there advice you can give

2:26:40.220 --> 2:26:42.680
 either on career or more generally on life?

2:26:43.820 --> 2:26:48.720
 Well, I would say what people often hear is that,

2:26:51.580 --> 2:26:54.420
 we're not actually here for that long a period of time.

2:26:55.960 --> 2:26:59.700
 And the world is on fire.

2:26:59.700 --> 2:27:03.020
 And whether humanity survives is not clear.

2:27:03.020 --> 2:27:05.740
 And how many species are we gonna kill

2:27:05.740 --> 2:27:08.440
 before we figure out not to do that anymore?

2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:12.780
 So I would advise you to really try to

2:27:15.060 --> 2:27:17.760
 develop a combination of what do you need

2:27:17.760 --> 2:27:20.400
 in terms of income for your own survival,

2:27:20.400 --> 2:27:22.820
 but what does the world need in terms of

2:27:25.680 --> 2:27:27.580
 help to make the world better?

2:27:27.580 --> 2:27:30.880
 And Howard Thurman, who we talked about,

2:27:30.880 --> 2:27:33.740
 who ran the Good Friday experiment, the minister there,

2:27:33.740 --> 2:27:36.300
 he said, he's got a famous quote attributed to him.

2:27:36.300 --> 2:27:40.180
 He says, and this is exactly it to young people.

2:27:40.180 --> 2:27:43.900
 He said, there's nothing particular that you should do,

2:27:43.900 --> 2:27:46.300
 but find what makes you come alive

2:27:46.300 --> 2:27:48.180
 because what the world needs is people

2:27:48.180 --> 2:27:50.760
 that have come alive and are passionate.

2:27:52.300 --> 2:27:57.300
 So I would say that be aware of this trap

2:27:57.300 --> 2:28:02.300
 that you need vast resources, that you need all this stuff.

2:28:03.900 --> 2:28:07.460
 I keep thinking of the super wealthy people

2:28:07.460 --> 2:28:09.980
 in first class on the Titanic,

2:28:09.980 --> 2:28:12.100
 as the Titanic is sinking.

2:28:12.100 --> 2:28:13.940
 Their money's not gonna help them.

2:28:13.940 --> 2:28:15.980
 The Earth is like Titanic.

2:28:15.980 --> 2:28:18.100
 We're sinking, we're destroying the planets,

2:28:18.100 --> 2:28:18.940
 destroying the environment.

2:28:18.940 --> 2:28:23.940
 So you need a certain amount of money to be comfortable

2:28:23.940 --> 2:28:25.740
 to be able to do that.

2:28:25.740 --> 2:28:28.260
 You need to be comfortable to not be

2:28:28.260 --> 2:28:29.440
 at that edge of survival,

2:28:29.440 --> 2:28:31.060
 because once you're at that edge of survival,

2:28:31.060 --> 2:28:32.420
 it's hard to think about anything else.

2:28:32.420 --> 2:28:34.240
 But I'd say to young people,

2:28:36.940 --> 2:28:39.040
 to the extent that you're able to do this,

2:28:39.040 --> 2:28:41.300
 and again, student debt and all this kind of stuff

2:28:41.300 --> 2:28:42.740
 is a big problem there too,

2:28:42.740 --> 2:28:47.740
 but really just try to find this combination

2:28:48.540 --> 2:28:50.220
 of what the world needs and what you need.

2:28:50.220 --> 2:28:52.660
 The other thing to say to young people is

2:28:52.660 --> 2:28:55.740
 that life is a lot shorter than you think,

2:28:57.600 --> 2:29:00.400
 and a 20 year plan is not really that long.

2:29:00.400 --> 2:29:03.120
 So if it takes you 20 years to get in a position

2:29:03.120 --> 2:29:07.280
 to do what you wanna do, go for it.

2:29:07.280 --> 2:29:08.820
 Have longterm plans.

2:29:08.820 --> 2:29:11.400
 The other part that was so important for me

2:29:11.400 --> 2:29:14.360
 to keep doing what I've been doing,

2:29:14.360 --> 2:29:17.320
 basically now it's 49 years

2:29:17.320 --> 2:29:18.880
 that I've sort of been devoting my life

2:29:18.880 --> 2:29:20.440
 on psychedelics since I was 18.

2:29:20.440 --> 2:29:23.620
 But when I started, I didn't think it would ever work.

2:29:23.620 --> 2:29:25.500
 I just thought this is the only idea I have

2:29:25.500 --> 2:29:29.220
 in this crazy world, this is what I wanna work on.

2:29:29.220 --> 2:29:30.980
 Luckily, I had support from my family

2:29:30.980 --> 2:29:34.660
 that took care of my survival needs, so I could do that.

2:29:34.660 --> 2:29:37.860
 But I realized that if my happiness

2:29:37.860 --> 2:29:40.940
 was dependent upon accomplishments,

2:29:40.940 --> 2:29:42.760
 that I might never be happy,

2:29:42.760 --> 2:29:47.760
 that I was able to reframe happiness in terms of effort.

2:29:47.760 --> 2:29:52.760
 So if I'm trying hard to get stuff to be better,

2:29:54.120 --> 2:29:55.480
 whether it's better or not,

2:29:55.480 --> 2:29:58.640
 I can be happy at the end of each day, I tried.

2:29:58.640 --> 2:30:01.600
 And so I think you try to separate out

2:30:01.600 --> 2:30:03.720
 the goals that you have and your happiness

2:30:03.720 --> 2:30:05.380
 to whether you're trying hard.

2:30:06.520 --> 2:30:08.080
 The other thing I would say

2:30:08.080 --> 2:30:13.000
 is that everybody has this humanity within them.

2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:14.940
 So be very careful about dividing the world

2:30:14.940 --> 2:30:19.940
 into us and them, and try to...

2:30:20.880 --> 2:30:23.600
 So one of the things that I've done

2:30:23.600 --> 2:30:27.760
 that has taken a long time,

2:30:27.760 --> 2:30:31.040
 because I feel like drugs are illegal.

2:30:31.040 --> 2:30:33.540
 I always felt like the police were the predator

2:30:33.540 --> 2:30:35.040
 and I'm the prey.

2:30:35.040 --> 2:30:36.480
 Yes.

2:30:36.480 --> 2:30:38.100
 But now we're working with the police,

2:30:38.100 --> 2:30:39.980
 and the police have tremendous trauma

2:30:39.980 --> 2:30:41.080
 from the work that they do.

2:30:41.080 --> 2:30:43.400
 We have one police officer who is now going,

2:30:43.400 --> 2:30:45.240
 he's a full time police officer,

2:30:45.240 --> 2:30:47.880
 he's also a psychotherapist.

2:30:47.880 --> 2:30:50.120
 And he's going through our training program

2:30:50.120 --> 2:30:53.880
 to learn how to give MDMA therapy to other police officers.

2:30:53.880 --> 2:30:56.680
 And I met his police chief a couple of times,

2:30:56.680 --> 2:30:58.760
 he got permission from his police chief

2:30:58.760 --> 2:31:01.080
 to go to the second part of our training program,

2:31:01.080 --> 2:31:03.720
 which is where we give MDMA to therapists

2:31:03.720 --> 2:31:06.320
 who volunteer as a patient.

2:31:06.320 --> 2:31:08.360
 So we have just a couple of weeks ago,

2:31:08.360 --> 2:31:11.360
 dosed the police with MDMA.

2:31:11.360 --> 2:31:13.760
 And so I think this idea of those people

2:31:13.760 --> 2:31:16.080
 that are on the quote, other side,

2:31:16.080 --> 2:31:19.760
 try to see through that to their humanity,

2:31:19.760 --> 2:31:21.320
 to what their pains and suffering,

2:31:21.320 --> 2:31:24.920
 what their struggles are, to the extent that you can.

2:31:24.920 --> 2:31:28.480
 And that I think, and build long term relationships.

2:31:28.480 --> 2:31:32.640
 You never know what's gonna come around 20 years from now.

2:31:32.640 --> 2:31:35.320
 So you help some people try to keep these relationships

2:31:35.320 --> 2:31:38.160
 going 20 years from now, something could come.

2:31:38.160 --> 2:31:43.160
 And also be persistent.

2:31:47.600 --> 2:31:49.960
 I think that's been the key to success.

2:31:49.960 --> 2:31:52.720
 I mean, once the FDA or DEA figured out

2:31:52.720 --> 2:31:53.800
 we're not going anywhere,

2:31:53.800 --> 2:31:55.760
 they're gonna have to deal with us,

2:31:55.760 --> 2:31:57.840
 then we started getting some progress.

2:31:57.840 --> 2:32:00.520
 So a mix of patience and stubbornness

2:32:00.520 --> 2:32:02.320
 that gets things done.

2:32:02.320 --> 2:32:05.440
 Is there something you've figured out

2:32:05.440 --> 2:32:08.400
 through your journey with psychedelics

2:32:08.400 --> 2:32:11.920
 about some of the big why questions about life?

2:32:11.920 --> 2:32:15.800
 Like, what the heck's the value of love?

2:32:18.200 --> 2:32:20.760
 Why does it suck so much that we die?

2:32:21.720 --> 2:32:25.440
 And for some of us, maybe it's the Russian in me,

2:32:25.440 --> 2:32:28.080
 but it's quite terrifying, the notion of it.

2:32:28.080 --> 2:32:30.080
 Or the biggest why question of them all,

2:32:30.080 --> 2:32:33.040
 which is what's the meaning of it all?

2:32:33.040 --> 2:32:35.640
 Well, yeah, what I've discovered is

2:32:35.640 --> 2:32:39.440
 that we don't need answers to those questions.

2:32:40.560 --> 2:32:45.560
 That the fact that we can feel happy,

2:32:46.400 --> 2:32:50.160
 that we can love, that we can have moments of happiness,

2:32:50.160 --> 2:32:51.000
 that's enough.

2:32:52.640 --> 2:32:56.160
 Figuring out these big questions, you can get lost in that.

2:32:56.160 --> 2:32:58.840
 And we all can come up with our answers.

2:32:58.840 --> 2:33:00.600
 What's the meaning of life?

2:33:00.600 --> 2:33:01.880
 Why is there life?

2:33:01.880 --> 2:33:02.920
 Why is there consciousness?

2:33:02.920 --> 2:33:06.000
 But I don't know that we need those answers.

2:33:06.000 --> 2:33:10.120
 What we know is that we're social creatures,

2:33:10.120 --> 2:33:14.720
 that other people can make us happy by certain things,

2:33:14.720 --> 2:33:17.800
 we can make other people happy, that one life is enough.

2:33:17.800 --> 2:33:22.800
 So this other part about why is it so tragic that we die?

2:33:23.160 --> 2:33:25.320
 I don't think it's tragic that we die.

2:33:25.320 --> 2:33:27.800
 So first off, if you believe in this collective unconscious,

2:33:27.800 --> 2:33:32.480
 but we have an impact that lasts.

2:33:32.480 --> 2:33:35.160
 But I think that for me at least,

2:33:35.160 --> 2:33:40.160
 I've been of the view that we should be grateful for death,

2:33:40.520 --> 2:33:42.600
 that death makes life precious,

2:33:42.600 --> 2:33:45.200
 that if we had an infinite amount of time,

2:33:46.120 --> 2:33:49.200
 I mean, I'm a bit of a procrastinator about stuff,

2:33:49.200 --> 2:33:52.280
 particularly things that are really hard to do

2:33:52.280 --> 2:33:54.200
 and you just don't do it.

2:33:54.200 --> 2:33:55.400
 And then like, where'd the day go?

2:33:55.400 --> 2:33:56.240
 I was gonna do this.

2:33:56.240 --> 2:33:59.320
 So if we had infinite life, we never died,

2:33:59.320 --> 2:34:03.440
 and would life be precious?

2:34:03.440 --> 2:34:04.400
 Would we do anything?

2:34:04.400 --> 2:34:05.280
 I don't think so.

2:34:05.280 --> 2:34:10.280
 So my parents gave every Jewish new year,

2:34:11.160 --> 2:34:14.000
 they would make their new year's card.

2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:16.360
 And one of the quotes was fantastic.

2:34:16.360 --> 2:34:20.320
 It was just, we have to make up for the brevity of life

2:34:20.320 --> 2:34:22.480
 with the intensity of life.

2:34:22.480 --> 2:34:24.520
 Oh man, that is good.

2:34:24.520 --> 2:34:29.080
 Well, the end makes things precious.

2:34:29.080 --> 2:34:30.600
 Death makes life precious.

2:34:30.600 --> 2:34:34.480
 The end of this conversation makes it precious,

2:34:34.480 --> 2:34:38.200
 and which is a great way to end, Rick.

2:34:38.200 --> 2:34:40.760
 I wanted to talk to you for a long time.

2:34:40.760 --> 2:34:43.280
 I share, you were very excited about the study.

2:34:43.280 --> 2:34:46.920
 I can now understand exactly why this is really promising.

2:34:46.920 --> 2:34:50.240
 This is really exciting, gives me hope about the future,

2:34:50.240 --> 2:34:53.720
 even if it doesn't come fast enough.

2:34:53.720 --> 2:34:56.560
 But like you said, I have to be patient and stubborn.

2:34:56.560 --> 2:34:58.360
 Thank you so much for wasting

2:34:58.360 --> 2:34:59.960
 all your valuable time with me today.

2:34:59.960 --> 2:35:01.760
 It's truly an honor to meet you and talk to you.

2:35:01.760 --> 2:35:02.840
 Not a waste at all.

2:35:02.840 --> 2:35:05.760
 I really appreciated this time together.

2:35:06.840 --> 2:35:08.400
 Thank you for listening to this conversation

2:35:08.400 --> 2:35:12.480
 with Rick Doblin, and thank you to Theragun, ExpressVPN,

2:35:12.480 --> 2:35:14.640
 Blinkist, and Asleep.

2:35:14.640 --> 2:35:17.920
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:35:17.920 --> 2:35:19.640
 And now let me leave you with some words

2:35:19.640 --> 2:35:21.520
 from Terrence McKenna.

2:35:21.520 --> 2:35:23.120
 Nature loves courage.

2:35:23.120 --> 2:35:25.760
 You make the commitment, and nature will respond

2:35:25.760 --> 2:35:29.280
 to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles.

2:35:29.280 --> 2:35:30.840
 Dream the impossible dream,

2:35:30.840 --> 2:35:33.160
 and the world will not grind you under.

2:35:33.160 --> 2:35:34.680
 It will lift you up.

2:35:34.680 --> 2:35:36.040
 This is the trick.

2:35:36.040 --> 2:35:38.680
 This is what all the teachers and philosophers

2:35:38.680 --> 2:35:42.880
 who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold,

2:35:42.880 --> 2:35:44.640
 this is what they understood.

2:35:44.640 --> 2:35:47.480
 This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall.

2:35:47.480 --> 2:35:49.320
 This is how magic is done,

2:35:49.320 --> 2:35:51.440
 by hurling yourself into the abyss

2:35:51.440 --> 2:35:54.600
 and discovering that it's a feather bed.

2:35:54.600 --> 2:36:21.600
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
