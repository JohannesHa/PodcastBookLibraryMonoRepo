00:00.000 --> 00:02.700
 The following is a conversation with Kamran Valfa,

00:02.700 --> 00:04.740
 a theoretical physicist at Harvard

00:04.740 --> 00:07.140
 specializing in string theory.

00:07.140 --> 00:10.940
 He is the winner of the 2017 Breakthrough Prize

00:10.940 --> 00:12.300
 in Fundamental Physics,

00:12.300 --> 00:15.740
 which is the most lucrative academic prize in the world.

00:15.740 --> 00:17.380
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:17.380 --> 00:20.140
 Headspace, Jordan Harmer's show,

00:20.140 --> 00:22.860
 Squarespace, and Allform.

00:22.860 --> 00:25.980
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:25.980 --> 00:28.020
 As a side note, let me say that string theory

00:28.020 --> 00:29.940
 is a theory of quantum gravity

00:29.940 --> 00:33.260
 that unifies quantum mechanics and general relativity.

00:33.260 --> 00:36.660
 It says that quarks, electrons, and all other particles

00:36.660 --> 00:40.300
 are made up of much tinier strings of vibrating energy.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.920
 They vibrate in 10 or more dimensions,

00:42.920 --> 00:45.020
 depending on the flavor of the theory.

00:45.020 --> 00:48.620
 Different vibrating patterns result in different particles.

00:48.620 --> 00:50.660
 From its origins, for a long time,

00:50.660 --> 00:54.680
 string theory was seen as too good not to be true,

00:54.680 --> 00:56.380
 but has recently fallen out of favor

00:56.380 --> 00:57.660
 in the physics community,

00:57.660 --> 01:00.180
 partly because over the past 40 years,

01:00.180 --> 01:03.100
 it has not been able to make any novel predictions

01:03.100 --> 01:06.260
 that could then be validated through experiment.

01:06.260 --> 01:08.260
 Nevertheless, to this day,

01:08.260 --> 01:10.420
 it remains one of our best candidates

01:10.420 --> 01:12.140
 for a theory of everything,

01:12.140 --> 01:15.540
 or a theory that unifies the laws of physics.

01:15.540 --> 01:18.000
 Let me mention that a similar story happened

01:18.000 --> 01:18.980
 with neural networks

01:18.980 --> 01:21.060
 in the field of artificial intelligence,

01:21.060 --> 01:22.580
 where it fell out of favor

01:22.580 --> 01:24.820
 after decades of promise and research,

01:24.820 --> 01:28.000
 but found success again in the past decade

01:28.000 --> 01:30.340
 as part of the deep learning revolution.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.140
 So I think it pays to keep an open mind,

01:33.140 --> 01:36.020
 since we don't know which of the ideas in physics

01:36.020 --> 01:38.100
 may be brought back decades later

01:38.100 --> 01:40.640
 and be found to solve the biggest mysteries

01:40.640 --> 01:42.380
 in theoretical physics.

01:42.380 --> 01:45.980
 String theory still has that promise.

01:45.980 --> 01:47.740
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast,

01:47.740 --> 01:50.820
 and here's my conversation with Kamran Wafa.

01:51.860 --> 01:54.580
 What is the difference between mathematics

01:54.580 --> 01:55.700
 and physics?

01:55.700 --> 01:57.460
 Well, that's a difficult question,

01:57.460 --> 01:58.420
 because in many ways,

01:58.420 --> 02:01.640
 math and physics are unified in many ways.

02:01.640 --> 02:04.480
 So to distinguish them is not an easy task.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.420
 I would say that perhaps the goals

02:06.420 --> 02:08.420
 of math and physics are different.

02:09.640 --> 02:14.420
 Math does not care to describe reality, physics does.

02:14.420 --> 02:16.220
 That's the major difference.

02:16.220 --> 02:19.380
 But a lot of the thoughts, processes, and so on,

02:19.380 --> 02:22.780
 which goes to understanding the nature and reality,

02:22.780 --> 02:24.680
 are the same things that mathematicians do.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.340
 So in many ways, they are similar.

02:27.220 --> 02:31.660
 Mathematicians care about deductive reasoning,

02:32.680 --> 02:35.500
 and physicists or physics in general,

02:35.500 --> 02:36.740
 we care less about that.

02:37.700 --> 02:40.980
 We care more about interconnection of ideas,

02:40.980 --> 02:42.900
 about how ideas support each other,

02:42.900 --> 02:46.220
 or if there's a puzzle, discord between ideas.

02:46.220 --> 02:48.220
 That's more interesting for us.

02:48.220 --> 02:50.540
 And part of the reason is that we have learned in physics

02:50.540 --> 02:53.300
 that the ideas are not sequential.

02:53.300 --> 02:54.920
 And if we think that there's one idea

02:54.920 --> 02:56.020
 which is more important,

02:56.020 --> 02:58.180
 and we start with there and go to the next idea,

02:58.180 --> 02:59.780
 and next one, and deduce things from that,

02:59.780 --> 03:01.580
 like mathematicians do,

03:01.580 --> 03:03.740
 we have learned that the third or fourth thing

03:03.740 --> 03:05.580
 we deduce from that principle

03:05.580 --> 03:08.380
 turns out later on to be the actual principle.

03:08.380 --> 03:10.900
 And from a different perspective,

03:10.900 --> 03:12.740
 starting from there leads to new ideas,

03:12.740 --> 03:14.940
 which the original one didn't lead to,

03:14.940 --> 03:18.140
 and that's the beginning of a new revolution in science.

03:18.140 --> 03:20.220
 So this kind of thing we have seen again and again

03:20.220 --> 03:21.080
 in the history of science,

03:21.080 --> 03:24.100
 we have learned to not like deductive reasoning

03:24.100 --> 03:27.180
 because that gives us a bad starting point,

03:27.180 --> 03:30.260
 to think that we actually have the original thought process

03:30.260 --> 03:32.220
 should be viewed as the primary thought,

03:32.220 --> 03:33.920
 and all these are deductions,

03:33.920 --> 03:35.580
 like the way mathematicians sometimes do.

03:35.580 --> 03:37.980
 So in physics, we have learned to be skeptical

03:37.980 --> 03:38.940
 of that way of thinking.

03:38.940 --> 03:41.220
 We have to be a bit open to the possibility

03:41.220 --> 03:44.260
 that what we thought is a deduction of a hypothesis

03:44.260 --> 03:47.080
 is actually the reason that's true is the opposite.

03:47.080 --> 03:48.940
 And so we reverse the order.

03:48.940 --> 03:52.660
 And so this switching back and forth between ideas

03:52.660 --> 03:56.620
 makes us more fluid about deductive fashion.

03:56.620 --> 03:59.460
 Of course, it sometimes gives a wrong impression

03:59.460 --> 04:00.980
 like physicists don't care about rigor.

04:00.980 --> 04:03.380
 They just say random things.

04:03.380 --> 04:05.900
 They are willing to say things that are not backed

04:05.900 --> 04:07.780
 by the logical reasoning.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.220
 That's not true at all.

04:09.220 --> 04:12.620
 So despite this fluidity

04:12.620 --> 04:14.980
 in saying which one is a primary thought,

04:14.980 --> 04:17.100
 we are very careful about trying to understand

04:17.100 --> 04:19.900
 what we have really understood in terms of relationship

04:19.900 --> 04:21.140
 between ideas.

04:21.140 --> 04:24.000
 So that's an important ingredient.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.340
 And in fact, solid math, being behind physics

04:27.340 --> 04:30.740
 is I think one of the attractive features

04:30.740 --> 04:32.220
 of a physical law.

04:32.220 --> 04:35.260
 So we look for beautiful math underpinning it.

04:35.260 --> 04:39.740
 Can we dig into that process of starting from one place

04:39.740 --> 04:43.060
 and then ending up at like the fourth step

04:43.060 --> 04:46.120
 and realizing all along that the place you started at

04:46.120 --> 04:47.000
 was wrong?

04:47.000 --> 04:50.540
 So is that happened when there's a discrepancy

04:50.540 --> 04:53.140
 between what the math says

04:53.140 --> 04:54.940
 and what the physical world shows?

04:54.940 --> 04:56.860
 Is that how you then can go back

04:56.860 --> 04:59.660
 and do the revolutionary idea

04:59.660 --> 05:02.060
 for different starting place altogether?

05:02.060 --> 05:04.800
 Perhaps I give an example to see how it goes.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.820
 And in fact, the historical example is Newton's work

05:08.820 --> 05:10.140
 on classical mechanics.

05:10.140 --> 05:14.320
 So Newton formulated the laws of mechanics,

05:14.320 --> 05:17.860
 the force F equals to MA and his other laws,

05:17.860 --> 05:20.980
 and they look very simple, elegant, and so forth.

05:20.980 --> 05:25.860
 Later, when we studied more examples of mechanics

05:25.860 --> 05:28.980
 and other similar things, physicists came up with the idea

05:28.980 --> 05:31.420
 that the notion of potential is interesting.

05:31.420 --> 05:33.820
 Potential was an abstract idea, which kind of came,

05:33.820 --> 05:37.000
 you could take its gradient and relate it to the force.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.720
 So you don't really need it a priori,

05:38.720 --> 05:41.200
 but it solved, helped some thoughts.

05:41.200 --> 05:45.940
 And then later, Euler and Lagrange reformulated

05:45.940 --> 05:49.220
 Newtonian mechanics in a totally different way

05:49.220 --> 05:50.340
 in the following fashion.

05:50.340 --> 05:51.580
 They said, if you take,

05:51.580 --> 05:53.580
 if you wanna know where a particle at this point

05:53.580 --> 05:55.980
 and at this time, how does it get to this point

05:55.980 --> 05:58.940
 at the later time, is the following.

05:58.940 --> 06:01.620
 You take all possible paths connecting this particle

06:01.620 --> 06:04.660
 from going from the initial point to the final point,

06:04.660 --> 06:07.140
 and you compute the action.

06:07.140 --> 06:08.380
 And what is an action?

06:08.380 --> 06:10.780
 Action is the integral over time

06:10.780 --> 06:14.160
 of the kinetic term of the particle minus its potential.

06:15.020 --> 06:16.780
 So you take this integral,

06:16.780 --> 06:19.100
 and each path will give you some quantity.

06:19.100 --> 06:23.060
 And the path it actually takes, the physical path,

06:23.060 --> 06:26.580
 is the one which minimizes this integral or this action.

06:26.580 --> 06:29.900
 Now, this sounded like a backward step from Newton's.

06:29.900 --> 06:32.720
 Newton's formula seemed very simple.

06:32.720 --> 06:35.180
 F equals to ma, and you can write F is minus

06:35.180 --> 06:36.860
 the gradient of the potential.

06:36.860 --> 06:40.020
 So why would anybody start formulating such a simple thing

06:40.020 --> 06:43.220
 in terms of this complicated looking principle?

06:43.220 --> 06:46.740
 You have to study the space of all paths and all things

06:46.740 --> 06:48.740
 and find the minimum, and then you get the same equation.

06:48.740 --> 06:50.020
 So what's the point?

06:50.020 --> 06:52.460
 So Euler and Lagrange's formulation of Newton,

06:52.460 --> 06:56.440
 which was kind of recasting in this language,

06:56.440 --> 06:58.060
 is just a consequence of Newton's law.

06:58.060 --> 06:59.820
 F equals to ma gives you the same fact

06:59.820 --> 07:02.220
 that this path is a minimum action.

07:02.220 --> 07:05.420
 Now, what we learned later, last century,

07:05.420 --> 07:08.520
 was that when we deal with quantum mechanics,

07:08.520 --> 07:11.780
 Newton's law is only an average correct.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.820
 And the particle going from one to the other

07:15.820 --> 07:17.880
 doesn't take exactly one path.

07:17.880 --> 07:21.780
 It takes all the paths with the amplitude,

07:21.780 --> 07:23.660
 which is proportional to the exponential

07:23.660 --> 07:26.940
 of the action times an imaginary number, i.

07:26.940 --> 07:29.940
 And so this fact turned out to be the reformulation

07:29.940 --> 07:30.780
 of quantum mechanics.

07:30.780 --> 07:33.500
 We should start there as the basis of the new law,

07:33.500 --> 07:35.660
 which is quantum mechanics, and Newton is only

07:35.660 --> 07:37.980
 an approximation on the average correct.

07:37.980 --> 07:40.460
 And when you say amplitude, you mean probability?

07:40.460 --> 07:43.180
 Yes, the amplitude means if you sum up all these paths

07:43.180 --> 07:45.100
 with exponential i times the action,

07:45.100 --> 07:48.380
 if you sum this up, you get the number, complex number.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.480
 You square the norm of this complex number,

07:50.480 --> 07:52.740
 gives you a probability to go from one to the other.

07:52.740 --> 07:57.740
 Is there ways in which mathematics can lead us astray

07:57.820 --> 08:01.500
 when we use it as a tool to understand the physical world?

08:01.500 --> 08:04.580
 Yes, I would say that mathematics can lead us astray

08:04.580 --> 08:08.260
 as much as old physical ideas can lead us astray.

08:08.260 --> 08:11.700
 So if you get stuck in something,

08:11.700 --> 08:13.300
 then you can easily fool yourself

08:13.300 --> 08:15.540
 that just like the thought process,

08:15.540 --> 08:17.300
 we have to free ourselves of that.

08:17.300 --> 08:19.060
 Sometimes math does that role, like say,

08:19.060 --> 08:20.580
 oh, this is such a beautiful math.

08:20.580 --> 08:22.020
 I definitely want to use it somewhere.

08:22.020 --> 08:23.820
 And so you just get carried away

08:23.820 --> 08:25.760
 and you just get maybe carried too far away.

08:25.760 --> 08:28.200
 So that is certainly true, but I wouldn't say

08:28.200 --> 08:30.620
 it's more dangerous than old physical ideas.

08:30.620 --> 08:34.420
 To me, new math ideas is as much potential

08:34.420 --> 08:36.380
 to lead us astray as old physical ideas,

08:36.380 --> 08:38.780
 which could be long held principles of physics.

08:38.780 --> 08:41.860
 So I'm just saying that we should keep an open mind

08:41.860 --> 08:43.900
 about the role the math plays,

08:43.900 --> 08:46.020
 not to be antagonistic towards it

08:46.020 --> 08:48.980
 and not to over, over welcoming it.

08:48.980 --> 08:51.060
 We should just be open to possibilities.

08:51.060 --> 08:53.660
 What about looking at a particular characteristics

08:53.660 --> 08:55.700
 of both physical ideas and mathematical ideas,

08:55.700 --> 08:56.820
 which is beauty?

08:56.820 --> 09:00.060
 You think beauty leads us astray, meaning,

09:00.060 --> 09:03.180
 and you offline showed me a really nice puzzle

09:03.180 --> 09:06.380
 that illustrates this idea a little bit.

09:06.380 --> 09:09.020
 Now, maybe you can speak to that or another example

09:09.020 --> 09:13.540
 where beauty makes it tempting for us to assume

09:13.540 --> 09:16.360
 that the law and the theory we found

09:16.360 --> 09:19.740
 is actually one that perfectly describes reality.

09:19.740 --> 09:22.820
 I think that beauty does not lead us astray

09:22.820 --> 09:25.920
 because I feel that beauty is a requirement

09:25.920 --> 09:27.740
 for principles of physics.

09:27.740 --> 09:29.580
 So beauty is a fundamental in the universe?

09:29.580 --> 09:30.900
 I think beauty is fundamental.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.740
 At least that's the way many of us view it.

09:32.740 --> 09:33.940
 It's not emergent.

09:33.940 --> 09:35.140
 It's not emergent.

09:35.140 --> 09:37.740
 I think Hardy is the mathematician who said

09:37.740 --> 09:40.820
 that there's no permanent place for ugly mathematics.

09:40.820 --> 09:42.940
 And so I think the same is true in physics

09:42.940 --> 09:46.860
 that if we find the principle which looks ugly,

09:47.900 --> 09:49.660
 we are not going to be, that's not the end stage.

09:49.660 --> 09:52.040
 So therefore beauty is going to lead us somewhere.

09:52.040 --> 09:54.840
 Now, it doesn't mean beauty is enough.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.500
 It doesn't mean if you just have beauty,

09:56.500 --> 09:58.980
 if I just look at something is beautiful, then I'm fine.

09:58.980 --> 10:00.260
 No, that's not the case.

10:00.260 --> 10:03.460
 Beauty is certainly a criteria that every good

10:03.460 --> 10:04.500
 physical theory should pass.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.500
 That's at least the view we have.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.260
 Why do we have this view?

10:08.260 --> 10:09.760
 That's a good question.

10:09.760 --> 10:13.340
 It is partly, you could say, based on experience

10:13.340 --> 10:17.060
 of science over centuries, partly is philosophical view

10:17.060 --> 10:20.080
 of what reality is or should be.

10:20.080 --> 10:23.780
 And in principle, it could have been ugly

10:23.780 --> 10:25.540
 and we might have had to deal with it,

10:25.540 --> 10:29.520
 but we have gotten maybe confident through examples

10:29.520 --> 10:32.460
 in the history of science to look for beauty.

10:32.460 --> 10:34.300
 And our sense of beauty seems to incorporate

10:34.300 --> 10:36.040
 a lot of things that are essential for us

10:36.040 --> 10:37.980
 to solve some difficult problems like symmetry.

10:37.980 --> 10:39.340
 We find symmetry beautiful

10:39.340 --> 10:41.260
 and the breaking of symmetry beautiful.

10:41.260 --> 10:45.420
 Somehow symmetry is a fundamental part

10:45.420 --> 10:50.020
 of how we conceive of beauty at all layers of reality,

10:50.020 --> 10:51.220
 which is interesting.

10:51.220 --> 10:55.220
 Like in both the visual space, like the way we look at art,

10:55.220 --> 10:57.140
 we look at each other as human beings,

10:57.140 --> 10:59.780
 the way we look at creatures in the biological space,

10:59.780 --> 11:01.220
 the way we look at chemistry,

11:01.220 --> 11:04.420
 and then into the physics world as the work you do.

11:04.420 --> 11:05.420
 It's kind of interesting.

11:05.420 --> 11:07.060
 It makes you wonder like,

11:08.500 --> 11:10.020
 which one is the chicken or the egg?

11:10.020 --> 11:13.100
 Is symmetry the chicken and our conception of beauty

11:13.100 --> 11:15.340
 the egg or the other way around?

11:15.340 --> 11:20.340
 Or somehow the fact that the symmetry is part of reality,

11:20.900 --> 11:24.220
 it somehow creates a brain that then is able to perceive it.

11:24.220 --> 11:27.060
 Or maybe this is just because we,

11:27.060 --> 11:32.060
 maybe it's so obvious, it's almost trivial,

11:32.300 --> 11:33.540
 that symmetry, of course,

11:33.540 --> 11:36.400
 will be part of every kind of universe that's possible.

11:37.940 --> 11:40.980
 And then any kind of organism that's able to observe

11:40.980 --> 11:44.340
 that universe is going to appreciate symmetry.

11:44.340 --> 11:46.060
 Well, these are good questions.

11:46.060 --> 11:47.380
 We don't have a deep understanding

11:47.380 --> 11:49.740
 of why we get attracted to symmetry.

11:49.740 --> 11:54.500
 Why do laws of nature seem to have symmetries underlying

11:54.500 --> 11:57.900
 them and the reasoning or the examples of whether,

11:57.900 --> 11:58.980
 if there wasn't symmetry,

11:58.980 --> 12:00.740
 we would have understood it or not.

12:00.740 --> 12:02.820
 We could have said that, yeah, if there were, you know,

12:02.820 --> 12:04.060
 things which didn't look that great,

12:04.060 --> 12:04.900
 we could understand them.

12:04.900 --> 12:08.060
 For example, we know that symmetries get broken

12:08.060 --> 12:10.300
 and we have appreciated nature

12:10.300 --> 12:12.420
 in the broken symmetry phase as well.

12:12.420 --> 12:14.300
 The world we live in has many things

12:14.300 --> 12:16.140
 which do not look symmetric,

12:16.140 --> 12:18.940
 but even those have underlying symmetry

12:18.940 --> 12:20.640
 when you look at it more deeply.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.080
 So we have gotten maybe spoiled perhaps

12:23.080 --> 12:25.940
 by the appearance of symmetry all over the place.

12:25.940 --> 12:26.980
 And we look for it.

12:26.980 --> 12:31.940
 And I think this is perhaps related to a sense of aesthetics

12:31.940 --> 12:33.340
 that scientists have.

12:33.340 --> 12:36.780
 And we don't usually talk about it among scientists.

12:36.780 --> 12:39.540
 In fact, it's kind of a philosophical view

12:39.540 --> 12:43.240
 of why do we look for simplicity or beauty or so forth.

12:43.240 --> 12:47.300
 And I think in a sense, scientists are a lot

12:47.300 --> 12:48.900
 like philosophers.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.180
 Sometimes I think, especially modern science

12:51.180 --> 12:54.880
 seems to shun philosophers and philosophical views.

12:54.880 --> 12:58.220
 And I think at their peril, I think in my view,

12:58.220 --> 13:01.340
 science owes a lot to philosophy.

13:01.340 --> 13:04.940
 And in my view, many scientists, in fact,

13:04.940 --> 13:06.180
 probably all good scientists

13:06.180 --> 13:08.840
 are perhaps amateur philosophers.

13:08.840 --> 13:11.020
 They may not state that they are philosophers

13:11.020 --> 13:13.400
 or they may not like to be labeled philosophers,

13:13.400 --> 13:14.740
 but in many ways what they do

13:14.740 --> 13:18.640
 is like what is philosophical takes of things.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.340
 Looking for simplicity or symmetry

13:20.340 --> 13:23.640
 is an example of that in my opinion, or seeing patterns.

13:23.640 --> 13:26.660
 You see, for example, another example of the symmetry

13:26.660 --> 13:29.420
 is like how you come up with new ideas in science.

13:29.420 --> 13:31.900
 You see, for example, an idea A

13:31.900 --> 13:33.660
 is connected with an idea B.

13:33.660 --> 13:36.780
 Okay, so you study this connection very deeply.

13:36.780 --> 13:39.300
 And then you find the cousin of an idea A,

13:39.300 --> 13:41.140
 let me call it A prime.

13:41.140 --> 13:44.060
 And then you immediately look for B prime.

13:44.060 --> 13:46.260
 If A is like B and if there's an A prime,

13:46.260 --> 13:47.340
 then you look for B prime.

13:47.340 --> 13:48.180
 Why?

13:48.180 --> 13:50.920
 Well, it completes the picture.

13:50.920 --> 13:51.760
 Why?

13:51.760 --> 13:53.180
 Well, it's philosophically appealing

13:53.180 --> 13:55.300
 to have more balance in terms of that.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.180
 And then you look for B prime and lo and behold,

13:57.180 --> 13:58.580
 you find this other phenomenon,

13:58.580 --> 14:01.160
 which is a physical phenomenon, which you call B prime.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.580
 So this kind of thinking motivates

14:03.580 --> 14:05.500
 asking questions and looking for things.

14:05.500 --> 14:08.580
 And it has guided scientists, I think, through many centuries

14:08.580 --> 14:10.860
 and I think it continues to do so today.

14:10.860 --> 14:12.940
 And I think if you look at the long arc of history,

14:12.940 --> 14:16.420
 I suspect that the things that will be remembered

14:16.420 --> 14:21.420
 is the philosophical flavor of the ideas of physics

14:21.460 --> 14:24.540
 and chemistry and computer science and mathematics.

14:24.540 --> 14:29.300
 Like, I think the actual details

14:29.300 --> 14:33.220
 will be shown to be incomplete or maybe wrong,

14:33.220 --> 14:34.960
 but the philosophical intuitions

14:34.960 --> 14:36.880
 will carry through much longer.

14:36.880 --> 14:39.380
 There's a sense in which, if it's true,

14:39.380 --> 14:43.140
 that we haven't figured out most of how things work,

14:43.140 --> 14:47.140
 currently, that it'll all be shown as wrong and silly.

14:47.140 --> 14:49.900
 It'd almost be a historical artifact.

14:49.900 --> 14:52.660
 But the human spirit, whatever,

14:52.660 --> 14:55.620
 like the longing to understand,

14:55.620 --> 14:59.040
 the way we perceive the world, the way we conceive of it,

14:59.040 --> 15:02.540
 of our place in the world, those ideas will carry on.

15:02.540 --> 15:03.380
 I completely agree.

15:03.380 --> 15:05.580
 In fact, I believe that almost,

15:05.580 --> 15:08.220
 well, I believe that none of the principles

15:08.220 --> 15:11.580
 or laws of physics we know today are exactly correct.

15:11.580 --> 15:13.700
 All of them are approximations to something.

15:13.700 --> 15:15.660
 They are better than the previous versions that we had,

15:15.660 --> 15:17.740
 but none of them are exactly correct,

15:17.740 --> 15:19.940
 and none of them are gonna stand forever.

15:19.940 --> 15:22.780
 So I agree that that's the process we are heading,

15:22.780 --> 15:24.100
 we are improving.

15:24.100 --> 15:26.380
 And yes, indeed, the thought process

15:26.380 --> 15:28.800
 and that philosophical take is common.

15:28.800 --> 15:33.420
 So when we look at older scientists,

15:33.420 --> 15:36.020
 or maybe even all the way back to Greek philosophers

15:36.020 --> 15:38.140
 and the things that the way they thought and so on,

15:38.140 --> 15:42.140
 almost everything they said about nature was incorrect.

15:42.140 --> 15:43.900
 But the way they thought about it

15:43.900 --> 15:45.860
 and many things that they were thinking

15:45.860 --> 15:46.940
 is still valid today.

15:46.940 --> 15:50.060
 For example, they thought about symmetry breaking.

15:50.060 --> 15:51.960
 They were trying to explain the following.

15:51.960 --> 15:53.660
 This is a beautiful example, I think.

15:53.660 --> 15:55.900
 They had figured out that the Earth is round,

15:55.900 --> 15:57.420
 and they said, okay, Earth is round.

15:57.420 --> 16:01.300
 They have seen the length of the shadow of a meter stick,

16:01.300 --> 16:02.500
 and they have seen that if you go

16:02.500 --> 16:04.540
 from the equator upwards north,

16:04.540 --> 16:06.460
 they find that depending on how far away you are,

16:06.460 --> 16:07.900
 that the length of the shadow changes.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.900
 And from that, they had even measured

16:09.900 --> 16:12.260
 the radius of the Earth to good accuracy.

16:12.260 --> 16:14.540
 That's brilliant, by the way, the fact that they did that.

16:14.540 --> 16:15.660
 Very brilliant, very brilliant.

16:15.660 --> 16:17.700
 So these Greek philosophers are very smart.

16:17.700 --> 16:20.640
 And so they had taken it to the next step.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.100
 They asked, okay, so the Earth is round,

16:23.100 --> 16:24.200
 why doesn't it move?

16:25.140 --> 16:26.260
 They thought it doesn't move.

16:26.260 --> 16:28.540
 They were looking around, nothing seemed to move.

16:28.540 --> 16:31.420
 So they said, okay, we have to have a good explanation.

16:31.420 --> 16:33.300
 It wasn't enough for them to be there.

16:33.300 --> 16:36.060
 So they really wanna deeply understand that fact.

16:36.060 --> 16:38.660
 And they come up with a symmetry argument.

16:38.660 --> 16:40.300
 And the symmetry argument was,

16:40.300 --> 16:43.460
 oh, if the Earth is a spherical,

16:43.460 --> 16:45.500
 it must be at the center of the universe for sure.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.380
 So they said the Earth is at the center of the universe.

16:47.380 --> 16:48.220
 That makes sense.

16:48.220 --> 16:50.700
 And they said, if the Earth is going to move,

16:50.700 --> 16:52.180
 which direction does it pick?

16:52.180 --> 16:54.820
 Any direction it picks, it breaks that spherical symmetry

16:54.820 --> 16:57.060
 because you have to pick a direction.

16:57.060 --> 16:59.320
 And that's not good because it's not symmetrical anymore.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.940
 So therefore, the Earth decides to sit put

17:01.940 --> 17:03.940
 because it would break the symmetry.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.760
 So they had the incorrect science.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.260
 They thought Earth doesn't move.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.660
 But they had this beautiful idea

17:08.660 --> 17:10.200
 that symmetry might explain it.

17:11.180 --> 17:12.620
 But they were even smarter than that.

17:12.620 --> 17:14.820
 Aristotle didn't agree with this argument.

17:15.940 --> 17:18.420
 He said, why do you think symmetry prevents it from moving?

17:18.420 --> 17:19.920
 Because the preferred position?

17:19.920 --> 17:21.340
 Not so.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.300
 He gave an example.

17:22.300 --> 17:26.100
 He said, suppose you are a person

17:26.100 --> 17:28.300
 and we put you at the center of a circle

17:29.380 --> 17:32.880
 and we spread food around you on a circle around you,

17:32.880 --> 17:35.040
 loaves of bread, let's say.

17:35.040 --> 17:39.080
 And we say, okay, stay at the center of the circle forever.

17:39.080 --> 17:39.980
 Are you going to do that

17:39.980 --> 17:41.820
 just because it's a symmetric point?

17:43.220 --> 17:44.640
 No, you are going to get hungry.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.940
 You're going to move towards one of those loaves of bread,

17:46.940 --> 17:49.460
 despite the fact that it breaks the symmetry.

17:49.460 --> 17:51.340
 So from this way, he tried to argue

17:51.340 --> 17:52.640
 being at the symmetric point

17:52.640 --> 17:55.360
 may not be the preferred thing to do.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.560
 And this idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking

17:57.560 --> 17:59.640
 is something we just use today

17:59.640 --> 18:01.580
 to describe many physical phenomena.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.600
 So spontaneous symmetry breaking

18:03.600 --> 18:04.940
 is the feature that we now use.

18:04.940 --> 18:08.040
 But this idea was there thousands of years ago,

18:08.040 --> 18:11.040
 but applied incorrectly to the physical world,

18:11.040 --> 18:12.000
 but now we are using it.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.740
 So these ideas are coming back in different forms.

18:14.740 --> 18:17.360
 So I agree very much that the thought process

18:17.360 --> 18:20.000
 is more important and these ideas are more interesting

18:20.000 --> 18:23.160
 than the actual applications that people may find today.

18:23.160 --> 18:24.640
 Did they use the language of symmetry

18:24.640 --> 18:26.840
 and the symmetry breaking and spontaneous symmetry breaking?

18:26.840 --> 18:28.200
 That's really interesting.

18:28.200 --> 18:32.500
 Because I could see a conception of the universe

18:32.500 --> 18:35.200
 that kind of tends towards perfect symmetry

18:35.200 --> 18:38.540
 and is stuck there, not stuck there,

18:38.540 --> 18:42.100
 but achieves that optimal and stays there.

18:42.100 --> 18:43.800
 The idea that you would spontaneously

18:43.800 --> 18:47.920
 break out of symmetry, like have these perturbations,

18:47.920 --> 18:51.160
 like jump out of symmetry and back,

18:51.160 --> 18:55.320
 that's a really difficult idea to load into your head.

18:55.320 --> 18:57.320
 Like where does that come from?

18:57.320 --> 18:59.940
 And then the idea that you may not be

18:59.940 --> 19:02.420
 at the center of the universe.

19:02.420 --> 19:04.920
 That is a really tough idea.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.320
 Right, so symmetry sometimes is an explanation

19:07.320 --> 19:08.920
 of being at the symmetric point.

19:08.920 --> 19:10.920
 It's sometimes a simple explanation of many things.

19:10.920 --> 19:15.520
 Like if you have a bowl, a circular bowl,

19:15.520 --> 19:18.120
 then the bottom of it is the lowest point.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.760
 So if you put a pebble or something,

19:19.760 --> 19:21.560
 it will slide down and go there at the bottom

19:21.560 --> 19:23.720
 and stays there at the symmetric point

19:23.720 --> 19:26.400
 because it's the preferred point, the lowest energy point.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.260
 But if that same symmetric circular bowl that you had

19:29.260 --> 19:33.600
 had a bump on the bottom, the bottom might not be

19:33.600 --> 19:36.920
 at the center, it might be on a circle on the table,

19:36.920 --> 19:39.320
 in which case the pebble would not end up at the center,

19:39.320 --> 19:40.880
 it would be the lower energy point.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.000
 Symmetrical, but it breaks the symmetry

19:43.000 --> 19:45.200
 once it takes a point on that circle.

19:45.200 --> 19:48.920
 So we can have symmetry reasoning for where things end up

19:48.920 --> 19:52.740
 or symmetry breakings, like this example would suggest.

19:52.740 --> 19:54.500
 We talked about beauty.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.640
 I find geometry to be beautiful.

19:56.640 --> 20:01.640
 You have a few examples that are geometric

20:01.880 --> 20:04.500
 in nature in your book.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.840
 How can geometry in ancient times or today

20:06.840 --> 20:09.520
 be used to understand reality?

20:09.520 --> 20:12.600
 And maybe how do you think about geometry

20:12.600 --> 20:17.540
 as a distinct tool in mathematics and physics?

20:17.540 --> 20:19.960
 Yes, geometry is my favorite part of math as well.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.480
 And Greeks were enamored by geometry.

20:22.480 --> 20:25.680
 They tried to describe physical reality using geometry

20:25.680 --> 20:27.980
 and principles of geometry and symmetry.

20:27.980 --> 20:31.240
 Platonic solids, the five solids they had discovered

20:31.240 --> 20:33.200
 had these beautiful solids.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.560
 They thought it must be good for some reality.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.000
 There must be explaining something.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.720
 They attached one to air, one to fire and so forth.

20:40.720 --> 20:44.440
 They tried to give physical reality to symmetric objects.

20:45.360 --> 20:48.600
 These symmetric objects are symmetries of rotation

20:48.600 --> 20:50.760
 and discrete symmetry groups we call today

20:50.760 --> 20:53.400
 of rotation group in three dimensions.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.240
 Now, we know now, we kind of laugh at the way

20:56.240 --> 20:57.960
 they were trying to connect that symmetry

20:57.960 --> 21:02.040
 to the laws of the realities of physics.

21:02.040 --> 21:05.840
 But actually it turns out in modern days,

21:05.840 --> 21:08.840
 we use symmetries in not too far away

21:09.880 --> 21:12.440
 exactly in these kinds of thoughts processes

21:12.440 --> 21:14.120
 in the following way.

21:14.120 --> 21:16.420
 In the context of string theory,

21:16.420 --> 21:18.640
 which is the field light study,

21:18.640 --> 21:20.840
 we have these extra dimensions.

21:20.840 --> 21:24.040
 And these extra dimensions are compact tiny spaces typically

21:24.040 --> 21:26.040
 but they have different shapes and sizes.

21:27.260 --> 21:30.200
 We have learned that if these extra shapes and sizes

21:30.200 --> 21:32.400
 have symmetries, which are related

21:32.400 --> 21:34.160
 to the same rotation symmetries

21:34.160 --> 21:36.200
 that the Greek we're talking about,

21:36.200 --> 21:38.560
 if they enjoy those discrete symmetries

21:38.560 --> 21:41.760
 and if you take that symmetry and caution the space by it,

21:41.760 --> 21:44.540
 in other words, identify points under these symmetries,

21:44.540 --> 21:48.520
 you get properties of that space at the singular points

21:48.520 --> 21:51.360
 which force emanates from them.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.240
 What forces?

21:52.240 --> 21:54.960
 Forces like the ones we have seen in nature today,

21:54.960 --> 21:59.080
 like electric forces, like strong forces, like weak forces.

21:59.080 --> 22:02.880
 So these same principles that were driving them

22:02.880 --> 22:06.600
 to connect geometry and symmetries to nature

22:06.600 --> 22:10.440
 is driving today's physics,

22:10.440 --> 22:13.920
 now much more modern ideas, but nevertheless,

22:13.920 --> 22:17.040
 the symmetries connecting geometry to physics.

22:17.040 --> 22:20.560
 In fact, often sometimes we ask the following question,

22:20.560 --> 22:24.680
 suppose I want to get this particular physical reality,

22:24.680 --> 22:27.420
 I wanna have this particles with these forces and so on,

22:27.420 --> 22:28.800
 what do I do?

22:28.800 --> 22:31.480
 It turns out that you can geometrically design

22:31.480 --> 22:33.160
 the space to give you that.

22:33.160 --> 22:35.400
 You say, oh, I put the sphere here, I will do this,

22:35.400 --> 22:36.680
 I will shrink them.

22:36.680 --> 22:39.540
 So if you have two spheres touching each other

22:39.540 --> 22:43.900
 and shrinking to zero size, that gives you strong forces.

22:43.900 --> 22:45.720
 If you have one of them, it gives you the weak forces.

22:45.720 --> 22:46.840
 If you have this, you get that.

22:46.840 --> 22:49.040
 And if you want to unify forces, do the other thing.

22:49.040 --> 22:52.840
 So these geometrical translation of physics

22:52.840 --> 22:54.880
 is one of my favorite things that we have discovered

22:54.880 --> 22:57.600
 in modern physics and the context of string theory.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.840
 The sad thing is when you go into multiple dimensions

22:59.840 --> 23:04.840
 and we'll talk about it is we start to lose our capacity

23:05.040 --> 23:09.560
 to visually intuit the world we're discussing.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.680
 And then we go into the realm of mathematics

23:11.680 --> 23:12.760
 and we'll lose that.

23:12.760 --> 23:15.720
 Unfortunately, our brains are such that we're limited.

23:15.720 --> 23:19.880
 But before we go into that mysterious, beautiful world,

23:19.880 --> 23:21.440
 let's take a small step back.

23:21.440 --> 23:23.760
 And you also in your book have this kind of

23:24.760 --> 23:27.280
 through the space of puzzles, through the space of ideas,

23:27.280 --> 23:32.000
 have a brief history of physics, of physical ideas.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.680
 Now, we talked about Newtonian mechanics leading all

23:35.680 --> 23:38.960
 through different Lagrangian, Hamiltonian mechanics.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.160
 Can you describe some of the key ideas

23:41.160 --> 23:42.840
 in the history of physics?

23:42.840 --> 23:46.960
 Maybe lingering on each from electromagnetism to relativity

23:46.960 --> 23:49.640
 to quantum mechanics and to today,

23:49.640 --> 23:52.760
 as we'll talk about with quantum gravity and string theory.

23:52.760 --> 23:55.880
 Sure, so I mentioned the classical mechanics

23:55.880 --> 23:57.760
 and the Euler Lagrangian formulation.

23:59.440 --> 24:03.200
 One of the next important milestones for physics

24:03.200 --> 24:07.240
 were the discoveries of laws of electricity and magnetism.

24:07.240 --> 24:10.520
 So Maxwell put the discoveries all together

24:10.520 --> 24:13.600
 in the context of what we call the Maxwell's equations.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.880
 And he noticed that when he put these discoveries

24:16.880 --> 24:20.560
 that Faraday's and others had made about electric

24:20.560 --> 24:23.640
 and magnetic phenomena in terms of mathematical equations,

24:23.640 --> 24:25.240
 it didn't quite work.

24:25.240 --> 24:27.800
 There was a mathematical inconsistency.

24:27.800 --> 24:31.240
 Now, one could have had two attitudes.

24:31.240 --> 24:32.760
 One would say, okay, who cares about math?

24:32.760 --> 24:35.400
 I'm doing nature, electric force, magnetic force,

24:35.400 --> 24:36.840
 math I don't care about.

24:36.840 --> 24:37.920
 But it bothered him.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.000
 It was inconsistent.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.760
 The equations he were writing, the two equations

24:40.760 --> 24:43.320
 he had written down did not agree with each other.

24:43.320 --> 24:45.280
 And this bothered him, but he figured out,

24:45.280 --> 24:47.360
 if you add this jiggle, this equation

24:47.360 --> 24:50.040
 by adding one little term there, it works.

24:50.040 --> 24:51.520
 At least it's consistent.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.400
 What is the motivation for that term?

24:53.400 --> 24:54.480
 He said, I don't know.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.040
 Have we seen it in experiments?

24:56.040 --> 24:57.200
 No.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.040
 Why did you add it?

24:58.040 --> 24:59.800
 Well, because of mathematical consistency.

24:59.800 --> 25:04.520
 So he said, okay, math forced him to do this term.

25:04.520 --> 25:08.200
 He added this term, which we now today call the Maxwell term.

25:08.200 --> 25:11.280
 And once he added that term, his equations were nice,

25:11.280 --> 25:13.520
 differential equations, mathematically consistent,

25:13.520 --> 25:17.120
 beautiful, but he also found the new physical phenomena.

25:17.120 --> 25:19.000
 He found that because of that term,

25:19.000 --> 25:22.520
 he could now get electric and magnetic waves

25:22.520 --> 25:27.280
 moving through space at a speed that he could calculate.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.560
 So he calculated the speed of the wave

25:29.560 --> 25:31.160
 and lo and behold, he found it's the same

25:31.160 --> 25:33.440
 as the speed of light, which puzzled him

25:33.440 --> 25:35.240
 because he didn't think light had anything

25:35.240 --> 25:37.760
 to do with electricity and magnetism.

25:37.760 --> 25:39.400
 But then he was courageous enough to say,

25:39.400 --> 25:40.920
 well, maybe light is nothing

25:40.920 --> 25:43.560
 but these electric and magnetic fields moving around.

25:44.520 --> 25:48.920
 And he wasn't alive to see the verification

25:48.920 --> 25:50.400
 of that prediction and indeed it was true.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.440
 So this mathematical inconsistency,

25:53.440 --> 25:58.240
 which we could say this mathematical beauty drove him

25:58.240 --> 26:02.320
 to this physical, very important connection

26:02.320 --> 26:05.080
 between light and electric and magnetic phenomena,

26:05.080 --> 26:07.520
 which was later confirmed.

26:07.520 --> 26:11.080
 So then physics progresses and it comes to Einstein.

26:11.080 --> 26:13.480
 Einstein looks at Maxwell's equation,

26:13.480 --> 26:15.120
 says, beautiful, these are nice equation,

26:15.120 --> 26:17.680
 except we get one speed light.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.480
 Who measures this light speed?

26:20.480 --> 26:23.480
 And he asked the question, are you moving?

26:23.480 --> 26:24.320
 Are you not moving?

26:24.320 --> 26:25.760
 If you move, the speed of light changes,

26:25.760 --> 26:27.720
 but Maxwell's equation has no hint

26:27.720 --> 26:29.360
 of different speeds of light.

26:29.360 --> 26:31.680
 It doesn't say, oh, only if you're not moving,

26:31.680 --> 26:33.600
 you get the speed, it's just you always get the speed.

26:33.600 --> 26:37.320
 So Einstein was very puzzled and he was daring enough

26:37.320 --> 26:39.120
 to say, well, you know, maybe everybody gets

26:39.120 --> 26:40.960
 the same speed for light.

26:40.960 --> 26:44.360
 And that motivated his theory of special relativity.

26:44.360 --> 26:45.720
 And this is an interesting example

26:45.720 --> 26:47.760
 because the idea was motivated from physics,

26:47.760 --> 26:50.080
 from Maxwell's equations, from the fact

26:50.080 --> 26:55.080
 that people try to measure the properties of ether,

26:56.720 --> 26:58.760
 which was supposed to be the medium

26:58.760 --> 27:00.720
 in which the light travels through.

27:00.720 --> 27:03.920
 And the idea was that only in that medium,

27:03.920 --> 27:06.520
 the speed of, if you're at risk with respect

27:06.520 --> 27:08.560
 to the ether, the speed, the speed of light,

27:08.560 --> 27:10.480
 then if you're moving, the speed changes

27:10.480 --> 27:11.920
 and people did not discover it.

27:11.920 --> 27:15.040
 Michelson and Morley's experiment showed there's no ether.

27:15.040 --> 27:17.560
 So then Einstein was courageous enough to say,

27:17.560 --> 27:20.120
 you know, light is the same speed for everybody,

27:20.120 --> 27:22.440
 regardless of whether you're moving or not.

27:22.440 --> 27:25.760
 And the interesting thing is about special theory

27:25.760 --> 27:29.880
 of relativity is that the math underpinning it

27:29.880 --> 27:31.320
 is very simple.

27:31.320 --> 27:35.640
 It's a linear algebra, nothing terribly deep.

27:35.640 --> 27:38.680
 You can teach it at a high school level, if not earlier.

27:39.560 --> 27:42.560
 Okay, does that mean Einstein's special relativity

27:42.560 --> 27:43.400
 is boring?

27:43.400 --> 27:44.560
 Not at all.

27:44.560 --> 27:47.280
 So this is an example where simple math, you know,

27:47.280 --> 27:50.880
 linear algebra leads to deep physics.

27:50.880 --> 27:53.080
 Einstein's theory of special relativity.

27:53.080 --> 27:56.640
 Motivated by this inconsistency that Maxwell's equation

27:56.640 --> 27:58.080
 would suggest for the speed of light,

27:58.080 --> 27:59.080
 depending on who observes it.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.720
 What's the most daring idea there,

28:00.720 --> 28:03.880
 that the speed of light could be the same everywhere?

28:03.880 --> 28:05.720
 That's the basic, that's the guts of it.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.080
 That's the core of Einstein's theory.

28:07.080 --> 28:09.480
 That statement underlies the whole thing.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.040
 Speed of light is the same for everybody.

28:11.040 --> 28:13.360
 It's hard to swallow and it doesn't sound right.

28:13.360 --> 28:16.320
 It sounds completely wrong on the face of it.

28:16.320 --> 28:19.960
 And it took Einstein to make this daring statement.

28:19.960 --> 28:22.560
 It would be laughing in some sense.

28:22.560 --> 28:26.520
 How could anybody make this possibly ridiculous claim?

28:26.520 --> 28:27.720
 And it turned out to be true.

28:27.720 --> 28:28.880
 How does that make you feel?

28:28.880 --> 28:31.400
 Because it still sounds ridiculous.

28:31.400 --> 28:33.080
 It sounds ridiculous until you learn

28:33.080 --> 28:34.960
 that our intuition is at fault

28:34.960 --> 28:37.560
 about the way we conceive of space and time.

28:37.560 --> 28:40.120
 The way we think about space and time is wrong

28:40.120 --> 28:43.360
 because we think about the nature of time as absolute.

28:43.360 --> 28:46.720
 And part of it is because we live in a situation

28:46.720 --> 28:49.400
 where we don't go with very high speeds.

28:49.400 --> 28:50.480
 There are speeds that are small

28:50.480 --> 28:52.000
 compared to the speed of light.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.760
 And therefore the phenomena we observe

28:54.760 --> 28:57.440
 does not distinguish the relativity of time.

28:57.440 --> 28:59.200
 The time also depends on who measures it.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.800
 There's no absolute time.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.880
 When you say it's noon today and now,

29:02.880 --> 29:04.360
 it depends on who's measuring it.

29:04.360 --> 29:07.000
 And not everybody would agree with that statement.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.520
 And to see that you would have to have fast observer

29:10.520 --> 29:12.720
 moving speeds close to the speed of light.

29:12.720 --> 29:15.760
 So this shows that our intuition is at fault.

29:15.760 --> 29:19.320
 And a lot of the discoveries in physics

29:19.320 --> 29:23.640
 precisely is getting rid of the wrong old intuition.

29:23.640 --> 29:25.960
 And it is funny because we get rid of it,

29:25.960 --> 29:28.200
 but it's always lingers in us in some form.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.000
 Like even when I'm describing it,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.960
 I feel like a little bit like, isn't it funny?

29:32.960 --> 29:34.480
 As you're just feeling the same way.

29:34.480 --> 29:35.800
 It is, it is.

29:35.800 --> 29:40.600
 But we kind of replace it by an intuition.

29:40.600 --> 29:43.440
 And actually there's a very beautiful example of this,

29:43.440 --> 29:46.040
 how physicists do this, try to replace their intuition.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.400
 And I think this is one of my favorite examples

29:48.400 --> 29:51.240
 about how physicists develop intuition.

29:52.160 --> 29:54.960
 It goes to the work of Galileo.

29:54.960 --> 29:58.600
 So, again, let's go back to Greek philosophers

29:58.600 --> 30:00.520
 or maybe Aristotle in this case.

30:00.520 --> 30:02.560
 Now, again, let's make a criticism.

30:02.560 --> 30:05.880
 He thought that the heavier objects fall faster

30:05.880 --> 30:07.000
 than the lighter objects.

30:07.000 --> 30:07.880
 Makes sense.

30:07.880 --> 30:08.840
 It kind of makes sense.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.960
 And people say about the feather and so on,

30:10.960 --> 30:12.680
 but that's because of the air resistance.

30:12.680 --> 30:13.640
 But you might think like,

30:13.640 --> 30:17.000
 if you have a heavy stone and a light pebble,

30:17.000 --> 30:18.480
 the heavy one will fall first.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.280
 If you don't do any experiments,

30:20.280 --> 30:21.480
 that's the first gut reaction.

30:21.480 --> 30:24.080
 I would say everybody would say that's the natural thing.

30:24.080 --> 30:25.560
 Galileo did not believe this.

30:25.560 --> 30:29.880
 And he kind of did the experiment.

30:29.880 --> 30:32.640
 Famously it said he went on the top of Pisa Tower

30:32.640 --> 30:34.680
 and he dropped these heavy and light stones

30:34.680 --> 30:35.800
 and they fell at the same time

30:35.800 --> 30:39.000
 when he dropped it at the same time from the same height.

30:39.000 --> 30:39.920
 Okay, good.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.400
 So he said, I'm done.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.640
 I've showed that the heavy and lighter objects

30:43.640 --> 30:44.480
 fall at the same time.

30:44.480 --> 30:45.840
 I did the experiment.

30:45.840 --> 30:49.440
 Scientists at that time did not accept it.

30:49.440 --> 30:50.760
 Why was that?

30:50.760 --> 30:54.240
 Because at that time, science was not just experimental.

30:54.240 --> 30:56.720
 The experiment was not enough.

30:56.720 --> 30:59.560
 They didn't think that they have to soil their hands

30:59.560 --> 31:01.840
 in doing experiments to get to the reality.

31:01.840 --> 31:03.320
 They said, why is it the case?

31:03.320 --> 31:04.160
 Why?

31:04.160 --> 31:06.360
 So Galileo had to come up with an explanation

31:06.360 --> 31:09.520
 of why heavier and lighter objects fall at the same rate.

31:09.520 --> 31:13.240
 This is the way he convinced them using symmetry.

31:13.240 --> 31:16.120
 He said, suppose you have three bricks,

31:16.120 --> 31:21.120
 the same shape, the same size, same mass, everything.

31:21.120 --> 31:24.880
 And we hold these three bricks at the same height

31:24.880 --> 31:25.720
 and drop them.

31:27.080 --> 31:29.960
 Which one will fall to the ground first?

31:29.960 --> 31:32.080
 Everybody said, of course, we know it's symmetry

31:32.080 --> 31:33.840
 tells you they're all the same shape,

31:33.840 --> 31:35.240
 same size, same height.

31:35.240 --> 31:36.800
 Of course, they fall at the same time.

31:36.800 --> 31:37.640
 Yeah, we know that.

31:37.640 --> 31:38.680
 Next, next.

31:38.680 --> 31:39.880
 It's trivial.

31:39.880 --> 31:42.000
 He said, okay, what if we move these bricks around

31:42.000 --> 31:42.840
 with the same height?

31:42.840 --> 31:45.160
 Does it change the time they hit the ground?

31:45.160 --> 31:46.320
 They said, if it's the same height,

31:46.320 --> 31:47.800
 again, by the symmetry principle,

31:47.800 --> 31:49.360
 because the height translation horizontal

31:49.360 --> 31:52.200
 translates to the symmetry, no, it doesn't matter.

31:52.200 --> 31:53.560
 They all fall at the same rate.

31:53.560 --> 31:54.400
 Good.

31:54.400 --> 31:55.840
 Does it matter how close I bring them together?

31:55.840 --> 31:56.920
 No, it doesn't.

31:56.920 --> 31:59.040
 Okay, suppose I make the two bricks touch

31:59.040 --> 31:59.880
 and then let them go.

31:59.880 --> 32:01.120
 Do they fall at the same rate?

32:01.120 --> 32:02.560
 Yes, they do.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.920
 But then he said, well, the two bricks that touch

32:04.920 --> 32:07.160
 are twice more mass than this other brick.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.640
 And you just agreed that they fall at the same rate.

32:09.640 --> 32:10.760
 They say, yeah, yeah, we just agreed.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.440
 That's right, that's great.

32:12.440 --> 32:13.280
 Yes.

32:13.280 --> 32:15.440
 So he deconfused them by the symmetry reasoning.

32:15.440 --> 32:18.320
 So this way of repackaging some intuition,

32:18.320 --> 32:19.840
 a different type of intuition.

32:19.840 --> 32:21.920
 When the intuitions clash,

32:21.920 --> 32:24.920
 then you side on the, you replace the intuition.

32:24.920 --> 32:25.920
 That's brilliant.

32:26.960 --> 32:31.280
 In some of these more difficult physical ideas,

32:31.280 --> 32:34.200
 physics ideas in the 20th century and the 21st century,

32:34.200 --> 32:36.120
 it starts becoming more and more difficult

32:36.120 --> 32:38.320
 to then replace the intuition.

32:38.320 --> 32:39.840
 What does the world look like

32:39.840 --> 32:42.840
 for an object traveling close to the speed of light?

32:42.840 --> 32:44.960
 You start to think about the edges

32:44.960 --> 32:47.480
 of supermassive black holes,

32:47.480 --> 32:51.000
 and you start to think like, what's that look like?

32:51.000 --> 32:54.640
 Or I've been into gravitational waves recently.

32:55.720 --> 32:58.040
 It's like when the fabric of space time

32:58.040 --> 33:01.400
 is being morphed by gravity,

33:01.400 --> 33:03.400
 like what's that actually feel like?

33:03.400 --> 33:06.880
 If I'm riding a gravitational wave, what's that feel like?

33:09.080 --> 33:12.160
 I mean, I think some of those are more sort of hippy,

33:12.160 --> 33:15.800
 not useful intuitions to have,

33:15.800 --> 33:18.720
 but if you're an actual physicist

33:18.720 --> 33:20.560
 or whatever the particular discipline is,

33:20.560 --> 33:23.520
 I wonder if it's possible to meditate,

33:23.520 --> 33:26.640
 to sort of escape through thinking,

33:27.520 --> 33:31.720
 prolong thinking and meditation on a world,

33:31.720 --> 33:35.280
 like live in a visualized world that's not like our own

33:35.280 --> 33:38.080
 in order to understand a phenomenon deeply.

33:38.080 --> 33:39.960
 So like replace the intuition,

33:41.440 --> 33:44.560
 like through rigorous meditation on the idea

33:44.560 --> 33:46.360
 in order to conceive of it.

33:46.360 --> 33:48.720
 I mean, if we talk about multiple dimensions,

33:48.720 --> 33:51.600
 I wonder if there's a way to escape

33:51.600 --> 33:53.920
 with a three dimensional world in our mind

33:53.920 --> 33:56.280
 in order to then start to reason about it.

33:56.280 --> 33:59.040
 It's, the more I talk to topologists,

34:01.200 --> 34:04.280
 the more they seem to not operate at all

34:04.280 --> 34:05.720
 in the visual space.

34:05.720 --> 34:07.840
 They really trust the mathematics,

34:07.840 --> 34:10.600
 like which is really annoying to me because topology

34:10.600 --> 34:15.480
 and differential geometry feels like it has a lot

34:15.480 --> 34:17.480
 of potential for beautiful pictures.

34:17.480 --> 34:18.640
 Yes, I think they do.

34:18.640 --> 34:23.280
 Actually, I would not be able to do my research

34:23.280 --> 34:26.160
 if I don't have an intuitive feel about geometry.

34:26.160 --> 34:29.640
 And we'll get to it as you mentioned before

34:29.640 --> 34:32.080
 that how, for example, in strength theory,

34:32.080 --> 34:33.440
 you deal with these extra dimensions.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.480
 And I'll be very happy to describe how we do it

34:35.480 --> 34:37.640
 because without intuition, we will not get anywhere.

34:37.640 --> 34:40.440
 And I don't think you can just rely on formalism.

34:40.440 --> 34:41.360
 I don't.

34:41.360 --> 34:44.120
 I don't think any physicist just relies on formalism.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.000
 That's not physics.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.680
 That's not understanding.

34:46.680 --> 34:48.080
 So we have to intuit it.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.280
 And that's crucial.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.760
 And there are steps of doing it.

34:50.760 --> 34:52.720
 And we learned it might not be trivial,

34:52.720 --> 34:53.840
 but we learn how to do it.

34:53.840 --> 34:56.520
 Similar to what this Galileo picture I just told you,

34:56.520 --> 34:59.400
 you have to build these gradually.

34:59.400 --> 35:02.000
 But you have to connect the bricks.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.760
 Exactly, you have to connect the bricks, literally.

35:04.760 --> 35:07.720
 So yeah, so then, so going back to your question

35:07.720 --> 35:10.040
 about the path of the history of the science.

35:10.040 --> 35:12.400
 So I was saying about the electricity and magnetism

35:12.400 --> 35:14.560
 and the special relativity where simple idea

35:14.560 --> 35:16.400
 led to special relativity.

35:16.400 --> 35:20.040
 But then he went further thinking about acceleration

35:20.040 --> 35:21.760
 in the context of relativity.

35:21.760 --> 35:23.840
 And he came up with general relativity

35:23.840 --> 35:26.000
 where he talked about the fabric of space time

35:26.000 --> 35:28.800
 being curved and so forth and matter

35:28.800 --> 35:32.080
 affecting the curvature of the space and time.

35:32.080 --> 35:36.960
 So this gradually became a connection

35:36.960 --> 35:38.560
 between geometry and physics.

35:38.560 --> 35:43.160
 Namely, he replaced Newton's gravitational force

35:43.160 --> 35:46.000
 with a very geometrical, beautiful picture.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.520
 It's much more elegant than Newton's,

35:47.520 --> 35:49.960
 but much more complicated mathematically.

35:49.960 --> 35:52.760
 So when we say it's simpler,

35:52.760 --> 35:55.000
 we mean in some form it's simpler,

35:55.000 --> 35:57.800
 but not in pragmatic terms of equation solving.

35:57.800 --> 35:59.800
 The equations are much harder to solve

35:59.800 --> 36:01.360
 in Einstein's theory.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.920
 And in fact, so much harder that Einstein himself

36:03.920 --> 36:06.000
 couldn't solve many of the cases.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.920
 He thought, for example, you couldn't solve the equation

36:07.920 --> 36:10.760
 for a spherical symmetric matter,

36:10.760 --> 36:12.960
 like if you had a symmetric sun,

36:12.960 --> 36:15.680
 he didn't think you can actually solve his equation for that.

36:15.680 --> 36:19.320
 And a year after he said that it was solved by Schwarzschild.

36:19.320 --> 36:21.120
 So it was that hard

36:21.120 --> 36:22.880
 that he didn't think it's gonna be that easy.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.960
 So yeah, deformism is hard.

36:24.960 --> 36:27.400
 But the contrast between the special relativity

36:27.400 --> 36:29.040
 and general relativity is very interesting

36:29.040 --> 36:31.520
 because one of them has almost trivial math

36:31.520 --> 36:34.520
 and the other one has super complicated math.

36:34.520 --> 36:37.600
 Both are physically amazingly important.

36:37.600 --> 36:40.080
 And so we have learned that, you know,

36:40.080 --> 36:44.840
 the physics may or may not require complicated math.

36:44.840 --> 36:47.560
 We should not shy from using complicated math

36:47.560 --> 36:48.760
 like Einstein did.

36:48.760 --> 36:49.920
 Nobody, Einstein wouldn't say,

36:49.920 --> 36:52.040
 I'm not gonna touch this math because it's too much,

36:52.040 --> 36:54.680
 you know, tensors or, you know, curvature

36:54.680 --> 36:56.320
 and I don't like the four dimensional space time

36:56.320 --> 36:57.960
 because I can't see four dimension.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.080
 He wasn't doing that.

36:59.080 --> 37:01.480
 He was willing to abstract from that

37:01.480 --> 37:03.600
 because physics drove him in that direction.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.400
 But his motivation was physics.

37:05.400 --> 37:06.520
 Physics pushed him.

37:06.520 --> 37:09.960
 Just like Newton pushed to develop calculus

37:09.960 --> 37:12.480
 because physics pushed him that he didn't have the tools.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.120
 So he had to develop the tools

37:14.120 --> 37:16.000
 to answer his physics questions.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.720
 So his motivation was physics again.

37:18.720 --> 37:20.760
 So to me, those are examples which show

37:20.760 --> 37:24.560
 that math and physics have this symbiotic relationship

37:24.560 --> 37:26.880
 which kind of reinforce each other.

37:26.880 --> 37:30.080
 Here I'm using, I'm giving you examples of both of them,

37:30.080 --> 37:32.520
 namely Newton's work led to development

37:32.520 --> 37:34.520
 of mathematics, calculus.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.720
 And in the case of Einstein, he didn't develop

37:36.720 --> 37:38.760
 Riemannian geometry, he just used them.

37:38.760 --> 37:42.160
 So it goes both ways and in the context of modern physics,

37:42.160 --> 37:44.520
 we see that again and again, it goes both ways.

37:44.520 --> 37:46.920
 Let me ask a ridiculous question.

37:46.920 --> 37:48.880
 You know, you talk about your favorite soccer player,

37:48.880 --> 37:52.400
 the bar, I'll ask the same question about Einstein's ideas

37:52.400 --> 37:54.640
 which is, which one do you think

37:54.640 --> 37:56.520
 is the biggest leap of genius?

37:56.520 --> 37:59.960
 Is it the E equals MC squared?

37:59.960 --> 38:01.560
 Is it Brownian motion?

38:01.560 --> 38:05.200
 Is it special relativity, is it general relativity?

38:05.200 --> 38:09.760
 Which of the famous set of papers he's written in 1905

38:09.760 --> 38:13.760
 and in general, his work was the biggest leap of genius?

38:13.760 --> 38:16.280
 In my opinion, it's special relativity.

38:16.280 --> 38:19.120
 The idea that speed of light is the same for everybody

38:19.120 --> 38:20.520
 is the beginning of everything he did.

38:20.520 --> 38:21.360
 The beginning is the seed.

38:21.360 --> 38:22.200
 The beginning.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.400
 Once you embrace that weirdness,

38:24.400 --> 38:25.640
 all the weirdness, all the rest.

38:25.640 --> 38:27.800
 I would say that's, even though he says

38:27.800 --> 38:29.720
 the most beautiful moment for him,

38:29.720 --> 38:31.840
 he says that is when he realized that if you fall

38:31.840 --> 38:33.720
 in an elevator, you don't know if you're falling

38:33.720 --> 38:36.440
 or whether you're in the falling elevator

38:36.440 --> 38:39.120
 or whether you're next to the earth, gravitational.

38:39.120 --> 38:41.800
 That to him was his aha moment,

38:41.800 --> 38:43.640
 which inertial mass and gravitational mass

38:43.640 --> 38:46.480
 being identical geometrically and so forth

38:46.480 --> 38:49.520
 as part of the theory, not because of, you know,

38:49.520 --> 38:52.280
 some funny coincidence.

38:52.280 --> 38:54.400
 That's for him, but I feel from outside at least,

38:54.400 --> 38:56.880
 it feels like the speed of light being the same

38:56.880 --> 38:59.200
 is the really aha moment.

38:59.200 --> 39:02.160
 The general relativity to you is not

39:02.160 --> 39:04.960
 like the conception of space time.

39:04.960 --> 39:06.600
 In a sense, the conception of space time

39:06.600 --> 39:08.600
 already was part of the special relativity

39:08.600 --> 39:10.920
 when you talk about length contraction.

39:10.920 --> 39:13.040
 So general relativity takes that to the next step,

39:13.040 --> 39:15.560
 but beginning of it was already space,

39:15.560 --> 39:17.560
 length contracts, time dilates.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.080
 So once you talk about those, then yeah,

39:19.080 --> 39:20.760
 you can dilate more or less different places

39:20.760 --> 39:21.960
 than its curvature.

39:21.960 --> 39:22.920
 So you don't have a choice.

39:22.920 --> 39:26.480
 So it kind of started just with that same simple thought.

39:26.480 --> 39:28.680
 Speed of light is the same for all.

39:28.680 --> 39:32.000
 Where does quantum mechanics come into view?

39:32.000 --> 39:33.520
 Exactly, so this is the next step.

39:33.520 --> 39:36.800
 So Einstein's, you know, developed general relativity

39:36.800 --> 39:38.440
 and he's beginning to develop the foundation

39:38.440 --> 39:39.920
 of quantum mechanics at the same time,

39:39.920 --> 39:42.240
 the photoelectric effects and others.

39:42.240 --> 39:45.680
 And so quantum mechanics overtakes, in fact,

39:45.680 --> 39:47.560
 Einstein in many ways because he doesn't like

39:47.560 --> 39:50.320
 the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics

39:50.320 --> 39:52.320
 and the formulas that's emerging,

39:52.320 --> 39:56.280
 but fits his march on and try to, for example,

39:56.280 --> 39:59.840
 combine Einstein's theory of relativity

39:59.840 --> 40:01.040
 with quantum mechanics.

40:01.040 --> 40:04.040
 So Dirac takes special relativity,

40:04.040 --> 40:07.800
 tries to see how is it compatible with quantum mechanics.

40:07.800 --> 40:10.520
 Can we pause and briefly say what is quantum mechanics?

40:10.520 --> 40:11.360
 Oh yes, sure.

40:11.360 --> 40:14.760
 So quantum mechanics, so I discussed briefly

40:14.760 --> 40:16.440
 when I talked about the connection

40:16.440 --> 40:18.520
 between Newtonian mechanics

40:18.520 --> 40:20.760
 and the Euler Lagrange reformulation

40:20.760 --> 40:23.120
 of the Newtonian mechanics and interpretation

40:23.120 --> 40:27.240
 of this Euler Lagrange formulas in terms of the paths

40:27.240 --> 40:28.560
 that the particle take.

40:28.560 --> 40:31.440
 So when we say a particle goes from here to here,

40:31.440 --> 40:34.480
 we usually think it classically follows

40:34.480 --> 40:38.520
 a specific trajectory, but actually in quantum mechanics,

40:38.520 --> 40:42.960
 it follows every trajectory with different probabilities.

40:42.960 --> 40:44.920
 And so there's this fuzziness.

40:44.920 --> 40:49.280
 Now, most probable, it's the path that you actually see

40:49.280 --> 40:51.840
 and deviation from that is very, very unlikely

40:51.840 --> 40:53.800
 and probabilistically very minuscule.

40:53.800 --> 40:55.040
 So in everyday experiments,

40:55.040 --> 40:58.000
 we don't see anything deviated from what we expect,

40:58.000 --> 41:00.760
 but quantum mechanics tells us that the things

41:00.760 --> 41:01.600
 are more fuzzy.

41:01.600 --> 41:05.760
 Things are not as precise as the line you draw.

41:05.760 --> 41:07.760
 Things are a bit like cloud.

41:07.760 --> 41:11.160
 So if you go to microscopic scales,

41:11.160 --> 41:12.560
 like atomic scales and lower,

41:12.560 --> 41:14.800
 these phenomena become more pronounced.

41:14.800 --> 41:16.280
 You can see it much better.

41:16.280 --> 41:18.360
 The electron is not at the point,

41:18.360 --> 41:21.320
 but the cloud spread out around the nucleus.

41:21.320 --> 41:25.280
 And so this fuzziness, this probabilistic aspect of reality

41:25.280 --> 41:28.280
 is what quantum mechanics describes.

41:28.280 --> 41:31.600
 Can I briefly pause on that idea?

41:31.600 --> 41:33.760
 Do you think quantum mechanics

41:33.760 --> 41:37.040
 is just a really damn good approximation,

41:37.040 --> 41:40.200
 a tool for predicting reality,

41:40.200 --> 41:43.120
 or does it actually describe reality?

41:43.120 --> 41:45.800
 Do you think reality is fuzzy at that level?

41:45.800 --> 41:48.440
 Well, I think that reality is fuzzy at that level,

41:48.440 --> 41:49.840
 but I don't think quantum mechanics

41:49.840 --> 41:51.800
 is necessarily the end of the story.

41:51.800 --> 41:55.760
 So quantum mechanics is certainly an improvement

41:55.760 --> 41:57.400
 over classical physics.

41:57.400 --> 42:00.200
 That much we know by experiments and so forth.

42:00.200 --> 42:02.200
 Whether I'm happy with quantum mechanics,

42:02.200 --> 42:04.000
 whether I view quantum mechanics,

42:04.000 --> 42:05.400
 for example, the thought,

42:05.400 --> 42:08.960
 the measurement description of quantum mechanics,

42:08.960 --> 42:09.960
 am I happy with it?

42:09.960 --> 42:11.760
 Am I thinking that's the end stage or not?

42:11.760 --> 42:12.720
 I don't.

42:12.720 --> 42:14.320
 I don't think we're at the end of that story.

42:14.320 --> 42:17.440
 And many physicists may or may not view this way.

42:17.440 --> 42:18.960
 Some do, some don't.

42:18.960 --> 42:22.000
 But I think that it's the best we have right now,

42:22.000 --> 42:23.080
 that's for sure.

42:23.080 --> 42:25.400
 It's the best approximation for reality we know today.

42:25.400 --> 42:27.320
 And so far, we don't know what it is,

42:27.320 --> 42:30.520
 the next thing that improves it or replaces it and so on.

42:30.520 --> 42:31.560
 But as I mentioned before,

42:31.560 --> 42:34.760
 I don't believe any of the laws of physics we know today

42:34.760 --> 42:36.720
 are permanently exactly correct.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.080
 That doesn't bother me.

42:38.080 --> 42:39.600
 I'm not like dogmatic saying,

42:39.600 --> 42:41.960
 I have figured out this is the law of nature.

42:41.960 --> 42:42.800
 I know everything.

42:42.800 --> 42:45.840
 No, no, that's the beauty about science

42:45.840 --> 42:47.600
 is that we are not dogmatic.

42:47.600 --> 42:49.560
 And we are willing to, in fact,

42:49.560 --> 42:53.960
 we are encouraged to be skeptical of what we ourselves do.

42:53.960 --> 42:55.440
 So you were talking about Dirac.

42:55.440 --> 42:56.640
 Yes, I was talking about Dirac, right.

42:56.640 --> 42:58.920
 So Dirac was trying to now combine

42:58.920 --> 43:01.440
 this Schrodinger's equations,

43:01.440 --> 43:04.600
 which was described in the context of trying to talk about

43:04.600 --> 43:06.680
 how these probabilistic waves of electrons

43:06.680 --> 43:07.840
 move for the atom,

43:07.840 --> 43:09.880
 which was good for speeds

43:09.880 --> 43:11.800
 which were not too close to the speed of light,

43:11.800 --> 43:14.880
 to what happens when you get to the near the speed of light.

43:14.880 --> 43:16.480
 So then you need relativity.

43:16.480 --> 43:19.440
 So then Dirac tried to combine Einstein's relativity

43:19.440 --> 43:20.680
 with quantum mechanics.

43:20.680 --> 43:22.480
 So he tried to combine them

43:22.480 --> 43:26.880
 and he wrote this beautiful equation, the Dirac equation,

43:26.880 --> 43:28.560
 which roughly speaking,

43:28.560 --> 43:31.520
 take the square root of the Einstein's equation

43:31.520 --> 43:33.120
 in order to connect it to Schrodinger's

43:33.120 --> 43:34.280
 time evolution operator,

43:34.280 --> 43:37.200
 which is first order in time derivative

43:37.200 --> 43:39.160
 to get rid of the naive thing

43:39.160 --> 43:40.600
 that Einstein's equation would have given,

43:40.600 --> 43:41.440
 which is second order.

43:41.440 --> 43:43.360
 So you have to take a square root.

43:43.360 --> 43:45.600
 Now square root usually has a plus or minus sign

43:45.600 --> 43:46.440
 when you take it.

43:47.520 --> 43:49.120
 And when he did this,

43:49.120 --> 43:50.800
 he originally didn't notice this plus,

43:50.800 --> 43:52.600
 didn't pay attention to this plus or minus sign,

43:52.600 --> 43:55.120
 but later physicists pointed out to Dirac says,

43:55.120 --> 43:57.280
 look, there's also this minus sign.

43:57.280 --> 43:58.440
 And if you use this minus sign,

43:58.440 --> 43:59.760
 you get negative energy.

44:01.120 --> 44:04.640
 In fact, it was very, very annoying that, you know,

44:04.640 --> 44:06.680
 somebody else tells you this obvious mistake you make.

44:06.680 --> 44:09.840
 Pauli famous physicist told Dirac, this is nonsense.

44:09.840 --> 44:11.640
 You're going to get negative energy with your equation,

44:11.640 --> 44:13.480
 which negative energy without any bottom,

44:13.480 --> 44:15.520
 you can go all the way down to negative.

44:15.520 --> 44:18.080
 Infinite energy, so it doesn't make any sense.

44:18.080 --> 44:19.120
 Dirac thought about it.

44:19.120 --> 44:22.200
 And then he remembered Pauli's exclusion principle

44:22.200 --> 44:23.040
 just before him.

44:23.040 --> 44:24.240
 Pauli had said, you know,

44:24.240 --> 44:26.640
 there's this principle called the exclusion principle

44:26.640 --> 44:30.240
 that, you know, two electrons cannot be on the same orbit.

44:30.240 --> 44:32.680
 And so Dirac said, okay, you know what?

44:32.680 --> 44:37.680
 All these negative energy states are filled orbits,

44:37.680 --> 44:38.920
 occupied.

44:38.920 --> 44:40.120
 So according to you,

44:42.200 --> 44:44.880
 Mr. Pauli, there's no place to go.

44:44.880 --> 44:47.200
 So therefore they only have to go positive.

44:47.200 --> 44:49.160
 Sounded like a big cheat.

44:49.160 --> 44:51.960
 And then Pauli said, oh, you know what?

44:51.960 --> 44:53.880
 We can change orbits from one orbit to another.

44:53.880 --> 44:55.800
 What if I take one of these negative energy orbits

44:55.800 --> 44:57.560
 and put it up there?

44:57.560 --> 44:59.720
 Then it seems to be a new particle,

44:59.720 --> 45:03.200
 which has opposite properties to the electron.

45:03.200 --> 45:06.000
 It has positive energy, but it has positive charge.

45:06.000 --> 45:06.920
 What is that?

45:09.160 --> 45:10.400
 Dirac was a bit worried.

45:10.400 --> 45:11.560
 He said, maybe that's proton

45:11.560 --> 45:13.480
 because proton has plus charge.

45:13.480 --> 45:14.720
 He wasn't sure.

45:14.720 --> 45:16.480
 But then he said, oh, maybe it's proton.

45:16.480 --> 45:17.760
 But then they said, no, no, no, no.

45:17.760 --> 45:19.360
 It has the same mass as the electron.

45:19.360 --> 45:22.240
 It cannot be proton because proton is heavier.

45:22.240 --> 45:23.080
 Dirac was stuck.

45:23.080 --> 45:25.840
 He says, well, then maybe another part we haven't seen.

45:27.600 --> 45:31.080
 By that time, Dirac himself was getting a little bit worried

45:31.080 --> 45:34.480
 about his own equation and his own crazy interpretation.

45:34.480 --> 45:37.080
 Until a few years later, Anderson,

45:37.080 --> 45:40.640
 in the photographic place that he had gotten

45:40.640 --> 45:42.000
 from these cosmic rays,

45:42.000 --> 45:45.920
 he discovered a particle which goes

45:45.920 --> 45:47.920
 in the opposite direction that the electron goes

45:47.920 --> 45:49.880
 when there's a magnetic field,

45:49.880 --> 45:52.320
 and with the same mass,

45:52.320 --> 45:55.160
 exactly like what Dirac had predicted.

45:55.160 --> 45:57.640
 And this was what we call now positron.

45:57.640 --> 46:00.280
 And in fact, beginning with the work of Dirac,

46:00.280 --> 46:03.200
 we know that every particle has an antiparticle.

46:03.200 --> 46:05.480
 And so this idea that there's an antiparticle

46:05.480 --> 46:06.840
 came from this simple math.

46:06.840 --> 46:08.800
 There's a plus and a minus

46:08.800 --> 46:12.800
 from the Dirac's quote unquote mistake.

46:12.800 --> 46:15.400
 So again, trying to combine ideas,

46:15.400 --> 46:18.080
 sometimes the math is smarter than the person

46:18.080 --> 46:20.080
 who uses it to apply it,

46:20.080 --> 46:21.200
 and you try to resist it,

46:21.200 --> 46:23.720
 and then you kind of confront it by criticism,

46:23.720 --> 46:25.080
 which is the way it should be.

46:25.080 --> 46:26.920
 So physicists comes and said, no, no, that's wrong,

46:26.920 --> 46:27.840
 and you correct it, and so on.

46:27.840 --> 46:30.800
 So that is a development of the idea

46:30.800 --> 46:32.800
 there's particle, there's antiparticle, and so on.

46:32.800 --> 46:34.800
 So this is the beginning of development

46:34.800 --> 46:37.440
 of quantum mechanics and the connection with relativity,

46:37.440 --> 46:38.880
 but the thing was more challenging

46:38.880 --> 46:40.760
 because we had to also describe

46:40.760 --> 46:44.760
 how electric and magnetic fields work with quantum mechanics.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.200
 This was much more complicated

46:46.200 --> 46:47.760
 because it's not just one point.

46:47.760 --> 46:50.360
 Electric and magnetic fields were everywhere.

46:50.360 --> 46:52.440
 So you had to talk about fluctuating

46:52.440 --> 46:54.200
 and a fuzziness of electrical fields

46:54.200 --> 46:56.320
 and magnetic fields everywhere.

46:56.320 --> 47:00.680
 And the math for that was very difficult to deal with.

47:00.680 --> 47:03.560
 And this led to a subject called quantum field theory.

47:03.560 --> 47:06.680
 Fields like electric and magnetic fields had to be quantum,

47:06.680 --> 47:09.080
 had to be described also in a wavy way.

47:09.080 --> 47:13.280
 Feynman in particular was one of the pioneers

47:13.280 --> 47:15.120
 along with Schrodingers and others

47:15.120 --> 47:17.000
 to try to come up with a formalism

47:17.000 --> 47:20.800
 to deal with fields like electric and magnetic fields,

47:20.800 --> 47:24.200
 interacting with electrons in a consistent quantum fashion.

47:24.200 --> 47:25.960
 And they developed this beautiful theory,

47:25.960 --> 47:27.600
 quantum electrodynamics from that.

47:27.600 --> 47:30.040
 And later on that same formalism,

47:30.040 --> 47:33.640
 quantum field theory led to the discovery of other forces

47:33.640 --> 47:35.520
 and other particles all consistent

47:35.520 --> 47:37.840
 with the idea of quantum mechanics.

47:37.840 --> 47:40.760
 So that was how physics progressed.

47:40.760 --> 47:43.600
 And so basically we learned that all particles

47:43.600 --> 47:47.440
 and all the forces are in some sense related

47:47.440 --> 47:49.640
 to particle exchanges.

47:49.640 --> 47:52.320
 And so for example, electromagnetic forces

47:52.320 --> 47:57.320
 are mediated by a particle we call photon and so forth.

47:57.440 --> 47:59.680
 And same for other forces that they discovered,

47:59.680 --> 48:01.040
 strong forces and the weak forces.

48:01.040 --> 48:03.880
 So we got the sense of what quantum field theory is.

48:03.880 --> 48:08.880
 Is that a big leap of an idea that particles

48:09.280 --> 48:12.200
 are fluctuations in the field?

48:12.200 --> 48:15.040
 Like the idea that everything is a field.

48:15.040 --> 48:18.240
 It's the old Einstein, light is a wave,

48:18.240 --> 48:20.240
 both a particle and a wave kind of idea.

48:20.240 --> 48:23.920
 Is that a huge leap in our understanding

48:23.920 --> 48:26.360
 of conceiving the universe as fields?

48:26.360 --> 48:27.200
 I would say so.

48:27.200 --> 48:29.720
 I would say that viewing the particles,

48:29.720 --> 48:31.800
 this duality that Bohr mentioned

48:31.800 --> 48:33.040
 between particles and waves,

48:33.040 --> 48:35.080
 that waves can behave sometimes like particles,

48:35.080 --> 48:36.320
 sometimes like waves,

48:36.320 --> 48:40.240
 is one of the biggest leaps of imagination

48:40.240 --> 48:42.800
 that quantum mechanics made physics do.

48:42.800 --> 48:45.480
 So I agree that that is quite remarkable.

48:45.480 --> 48:50.240
 Is duality fundamental to the universe

48:50.240 --> 48:52.200
 or is it just because we don't understand it fully?

48:52.200 --> 48:54.320
 Like will it eventually collapse

48:54.320 --> 48:57.800
 into a clean explanation that doesn't require duality?

48:57.800 --> 49:02.440
 Like that a phenomena could be two things at once

49:02.440 --> 49:04.400
 and both to be true.

49:04.400 --> 49:05.960
 So that seems weird.

49:05.960 --> 49:08.320
 So in fact I was going to get to that

49:08.320 --> 49:09.360
 when we get to string theory

49:09.360 --> 49:11.000
 but maybe I can comment on that now.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.520
 Duality turns out to be running the show today

49:13.520 --> 49:15.600
 and the whole thing that we are doing is string theory.

49:15.600 --> 49:17.840
 Duality is the name of the game.

49:17.840 --> 49:19.440
 So it's the most beautiful subject

49:19.440 --> 49:20.840
 and I want to talk about it.

49:20.840 --> 49:23.440
 Let's talk about it in the context of string theory then.

49:23.440 --> 49:27.200
 So we do want to take a next step into,

49:27.200 --> 49:28.680
 because we mentioned general relativity,

49:28.680 --> 49:30.480
 we mentioned quantum mechanics,

49:30.480 --> 49:32.640
 is there something to be said about quantum gravity?

49:32.640 --> 49:34.960
 Yes, that's exactly the right point to talk about.

49:34.960 --> 49:37.480
 So namely we have talked about quantum fields

49:37.480 --> 49:39.760
 and I talked about electric forces,

49:39.760 --> 49:42.720
 photon being the particle carrying those forces.

49:42.720 --> 49:46.600
 So for gravity, quantizing gravitational field

49:46.600 --> 49:49.600
 which is this curvature of space time according to Einstein,

49:49.600 --> 49:51.640
 you get another particle called graviton.

49:52.520 --> 49:55.000
 So what about gravitons?

49:55.000 --> 49:56.440
 Should be there, no problem.

49:56.440 --> 49:59.160
 So then you start computing it.

49:59.160 --> 50:00.440
 What do I mean by computing it?

50:00.440 --> 50:03.400
 Well, you compute scattering of one graviton

50:03.400 --> 50:06.080
 off another graviton, maybe with graviton with an electron

50:06.080 --> 50:07.920
 and so on, see what you get.

50:07.920 --> 50:12.480
 Feynman had already mastered this quantum electrodynamics.

50:12.480 --> 50:14.400
 He said, no problem, let me do it.

50:14.400 --> 50:17.200
 Even though these are such weak forces,

50:17.200 --> 50:18.360
 the gravity is very weak.

50:18.360 --> 50:19.680
 So therefore to see them,

50:19.680 --> 50:23.240
 these quantum effects of gravitational waves was impossible.

50:23.240 --> 50:25.480
 It's even impossible today.

50:25.480 --> 50:27.680
 So Feynman just did it for fun.

50:27.680 --> 50:30.080
 He usually had this mindset that I want to do something

50:30.080 --> 50:31.160
 which I will see in experiment,

50:31.160 --> 50:33.240
 but this one, let's just see what it does.

50:34.360 --> 50:36.680
 And he was surprised because the same techniques

50:36.680 --> 50:39.960
 he was using for doing the same calculations,

50:39.960 --> 50:43.120
 quantum electrodynamics, when applied to gravity failed.

50:44.720 --> 50:46.280
 The formulas seem to make sense,

50:46.280 --> 50:47.560
 but he had to do some integrals

50:47.560 --> 50:49.040
 and he found that when he does those integrals,

50:49.040 --> 50:52.200
 he got infinity and it didn't make any sense.

50:52.200 --> 50:54.520
 Now there were similar infinities in the other pieces

50:54.520 --> 50:56.920
 but he had managed to make sense out of those before.

50:56.920 --> 50:59.920
 This was no way he could make sense out of it.

50:59.920 --> 51:01.920
 He just didn't know what to do.

51:01.920 --> 51:03.560
 He didn't feel it's an urgent issue

51:03.560 --> 51:05.800
 because nobody could do the experiment.

51:05.800 --> 51:07.840
 So he was kind of said, okay, there's this thing,

51:07.840 --> 51:09.440
 but okay, we don't know how to exactly do it,

51:09.440 --> 51:11.680
 but that's the way it is.

51:11.680 --> 51:14.080
 So in some sense, a natural conclusion

51:14.080 --> 51:16.640
 from what Feynman did could have been like,

51:16.640 --> 51:19.440
 gravity cannot be consistent with quantum theory,

51:19.440 --> 51:20.600
 but that cannot be the case

51:20.600 --> 51:22.000
 because gravity is in our universe,

51:22.000 --> 51:23.040
 quantum mechanics in our universe,

51:23.040 --> 51:25.560
 they both together somehow should work.

51:25.560 --> 51:28.960
 So it's not acceptable to say they don't work together.

51:28.960 --> 51:30.800
 So that was a puzzle.

51:30.800 --> 51:32.400
 How does it possibly work?

51:32.400 --> 51:34.660
 It was left open.

51:34.660 --> 51:37.120
 And then we get to the string theory.

51:37.120 --> 51:38.880
 So this is the puzzle of quantum gravity.

51:38.880 --> 51:41.420
 The particle description of quantum gravity failed.

51:41.420 --> 51:43.160
 So the infinity shows up.

51:43.160 --> 51:45.840
 What do we do with infinity?

51:45.840 --> 51:47.120
 Let's get to the fun part.

51:47.120 --> 51:48.760
 Let's talk about string theory.

51:48.760 --> 51:49.600
 Yes.

51:50.840 --> 51:55.840
 Let's discuss some technical basics of string theory.

51:56.300 --> 51:57.740
 What is string theory?

51:57.740 --> 51:59.140
 What is a string?

51:59.140 --> 52:01.080
 How many dimensions are we talking about?

52:01.080 --> 52:02.720
 What are the different states?

52:02.720 --> 52:04.960
 How do we represent the elementary particles

52:04.960 --> 52:09.780
 and the laws of physics using this new framework?

52:09.780 --> 52:12.840
 So string theory is the idea

52:12.840 --> 52:16.280
 that the fundamental entities are not particles,

52:16.280 --> 52:18.920
 but extended higher dimensional objects

52:18.920 --> 52:22.360
 like one dimensional strings, like loops.

52:22.360 --> 52:25.000
 These loops could be open like with two ends,

52:25.000 --> 52:29.720
 like an interval or a circle without any ends.

52:29.720 --> 52:32.700
 And they're vibrating and moving around in space.

52:32.700 --> 52:34.880
 So how big they are?

52:34.880 --> 52:37.600
 Well, you can of course stretch it and make it big,

52:37.600 --> 52:39.600
 or you can just let it be whatever it wants.

52:39.600 --> 52:41.320
 It can be as small as a point

52:41.320 --> 52:44.280
 because the circle can shrink to a point

52:44.280 --> 52:45.520
 and be very light,

52:45.520 --> 52:48.080
 or you can stretch it and becomes very massive,

52:48.080 --> 52:50.240
 or it could oscillate and become massive that way.

52:50.240 --> 52:52.320
 So it depends on which kind of state you have.

52:52.320 --> 52:55.000
 In fact, the string can have infinitely many modes,

52:55.000 --> 52:56.920
 depending on which kind of oscillation it's doing.

52:56.920 --> 52:59.040
 Like a guitar has different harmonics,

52:59.040 --> 53:00.140
 string has different harmonics,

53:00.140 --> 53:03.000
 but for the string, each harmonic is a particle.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.440
 So each particle will give you,

53:04.440 --> 53:07.480
 ah, this is a more massive harmonic, this is a less massive.

53:07.480 --> 53:10.000
 So the lightest harmonic, so to speak, is no harmonics,

53:10.000 --> 53:12.820
 which means like the string shrunk to a point,

53:12.820 --> 53:15.280
 and then it becomes like a massless particles

53:15.280 --> 53:19.600
 or light particles like photon and graviton and so forth.

53:19.600 --> 53:22.640
 So when you look at tiny strings,

53:22.640 --> 53:25.500
 which are shrunk to a point, the lightest ones,

53:25.500 --> 53:27.640
 they look like the particles that we think,

53:27.640 --> 53:28.560
 they're like particles.

53:28.560 --> 53:31.100
 In other words, from far away, they look like a point.

53:31.100 --> 53:32.140
 But of course, if you zoom in,

53:32.140 --> 53:35.080
 there's this tiny little circle that's there

53:35.080 --> 53:37.080
 that's shrunk to almost a point.

53:37.080 --> 53:40.560
 Should we be imagining, this is to the visual intuition,

53:40.560 --> 53:42.720
 should we be imagining literally strings

53:42.720 --> 53:47.120
 that are potentially connected as a loop or not?

53:47.120 --> 53:50.640
 We knew, and when somebody outside of physics

53:50.640 --> 53:53.920
 is imagining a basic element of string theory,

53:53.920 --> 53:55.080
 which is a string,

53:56.520 --> 53:58.720
 should we literally be thinking about a string?

53:58.720 --> 54:00.560
 Yes, you should literally think about string,

54:00.560 --> 54:02.600
 but string with zero thickness.

54:02.600 --> 54:03.920
 With zero thickness.

54:03.920 --> 54:07.720
 So notice, it's a loop of energy, so to speak,

54:07.720 --> 54:08.780
 if you can think of it that way.

54:08.780 --> 54:11.080
 And so there's a tension like a regular string,

54:11.080 --> 54:14.120
 if you pull it, there's, you know, you have to stretch it.

54:14.120 --> 54:16.280
 But it's not like a thickness, like you're made of something,

54:16.280 --> 54:17.800
 it's just energy.

54:17.800 --> 54:19.680
 It's not made of atoms or something like that.

54:19.680 --> 54:21.800
 But it is very, very tiny.

54:21.800 --> 54:22.640
 Very tiny.

54:22.640 --> 54:25.680
 Much smaller than elementary particles of physics.

54:25.680 --> 54:26.600
 Much smaller.

54:26.600 --> 54:29.760
 So we think if you let the string to be by itself,

54:29.760 --> 54:32.240
 the lowest state, there'll be like fuzziness

54:32.240 --> 54:33.840
 or a size of that tiny little circle,

54:33.840 --> 54:35.320
 which is like a point,

54:35.320 --> 54:37.340
 about, could be anything between,

54:37.340 --> 54:38.380
 we don't know the exact size,

54:38.380 --> 54:40.320
 but in different models have different sizes,

54:40.320 --> 54:42.160
 but something of the order of 10 to the minus,

54:42.160 --> 54:43.620
 let's say 30 centimeters.

54:43.620 --> 54:46.680
 So 10 to the minus 30 centimeters,

54:46.680 --> 54:48.360
 just to compare it with the size of the atom,

54:48.360 --> 54:50.400
 which is 10 to the minus eight centimeters,

54:50.400 --> 54:53.320
 is 22 orders of magnitude smaller.

54:53.320 --> 54:54.160
 So.

54:54.160 --> 54:56.140
 Unimaginably small, I would say.

54:56.140 --> 54:56.980
 Very small.

54:56.980 --> 54:58.800
 So we basically think from far away,

54:58.800 --> 55:00.920
 string is like a point particle.

55:00.920 --> 55:03.720
 And that's why a lot of the things that we learned

55:03.720 --> 55:04.920
 about point particle physics

55:04.920 --> 55:07.020
 carries over directly to strings.

55:07.020 --> 55:09.000
 So therefore there's not much of a mystery

55:09.000 --> 55:10.940
 why particle physics was successful,

55:10.940 --> 55:12.440
 because a string is like a particle

55:12.440 --> 55:13.640
 when it's not stretched.

55:14.560 --> 55:17.000
 But it turns out having this size,

55:17.000 --> 55:20.240
 being able to oscillate, get bigger,

55:20.240 --> 55:22.460
 turned out to be resolving this puzzles

55:22.460 --> 55:26.700
 that Feynman was having in calculating his diagrams,

55:26.700 --> 55:28.640
 and it gets rid of those infinities.

55:28.640 --> 55:31.360
 So when you're trying to do those infinities,

55:31.360 --> 55:34.400
 the regions that give infinities to Feynman,

55:34.400 --> 55:35.780
 as soon as you get to those regions,

55:35.780 --> 55:38.080
 then this string starts to oscillate,

55:38.080 --> 55:40.560
 and these oscillation structure of the strings

55:40.560 --> 55:43.040
 resolves those infinities to finite answer at the end.

55:43.040 --> 55:45.040
 So the size of the string,

55:45.040 --> 55:46.820
 the fact that it's one dimensional,

55:46.820 --> 55:48.720
 gives a finite answer at the end.

55:48.720 --> 55:50.760
 Resolves this paradox.

55:50.760 --> 55:54.160
 Now, perhaps it's also useful to recount

55:54.160 --> 55:56.320
 of how string theory came to be.

55:56.320 --> 55:58.360
 Because it wasn't like somebody say,

55:58.360 --> 56:01.920
 well, let me solve the problem of Einstein's,

56:01.920 --> 56:04.480
 solve the problem that Feynman had with unifying

56:04.480 --> 56:06.560
 Einstein's theory with quantum mechanics

56:06.560 --> 56:08.120
 by replacing the point by a string.

56:08.120 --> 56:10.200
 No, that's not the way the thought process,

56:10.200 --> 56:12.820
 the thought process was much more random.

56:14.220 --> 56:16.020
 Physicist, then it's John on this case,

56:16.020 --> 56:17.960
 was trying to describe the interactions

56:17.960 --> 56:22.160
 they were seeing in colliders, in accelerators.

56:22.160 --> 56:23.600
 And they were seeing that some process,

56:23.600 --> 56:26.520
 in some process, when two particles came together

56:26.520 --> 56:29.800
 and joined together and when they were separately,

56:29.800 --> 56:34.060
 in one way, and the opposite way, they behave the same way.

56:34.060 --> 56:37.680
 In some way, there was a symmetry, a duality,

56:37.680 --> 56:38.960
 which he didn't understand.

56:38.960 --> 56:41.960
 The particles didn't seem to have that symmetry.

56:41.960 --> 56:43.060
 He said, I don't know what it is,

56:43.060 --> 56:44.760
 what's the reason that these colliders

56:44.760 --> 56:46.780
 and experiments we're doing seems to have the symmetry,

56:46.780 --> 56:48.960
 but let me write the mathematical formula,

56:49.840 --> 56:51.680
 which exhibits that symmetry.

56:51.680 --> 56:54.080
 He used gamma functions, beta functions and all that,

56:54.080 --> 56:56.580
 you know, complete math, no physics,

56:56.580 --> 56:59.320
 other than trying to get symmetry out of his equation.

56:59.320 --> 57:03.360
 He just wrote down a formula as the answer for a process,

57:03.360 --> 57:04.840
 not a method to compute it.

57:04.840 --> 57:08.120
 Just say, wouldn't it be nice if this was the answer?

57:08.120 --> 57:08.960
 Yes.

57:08.960 --> 57:11.200
 Physics looked at this one, that's intriguing,

57:11.200 --> 57:13.480
 it has the symmetry all right, but what is this?

57:13.480 --> 57:14.800
 Where is this coming from?

57:14.800 --> 57:17.400
 Which kind of physics gives you this?

57:17.400 --> 57:18.240
 So I don't know.

57:19.660 --> 57:21.760
 A few years later, people saw that,

57:21.760 --> 57:23.520
 oh, the equation that you're writing,

57:23.520 --> 57:26.400
 the process you're writing in the intermediate channels

57:26.400 --> 57:27.800
 that particles come together,

57:27.800 --> 57:30.100
 seems to have all the harmonics.

57:30.100 --> 57:32.320
 Harmonics sounds like a string.

57:32.320 --> 57:33.680
 Let me see if what you're describing

57:33.680 --> 57:34.680
 has anything to do with the strings.

57:34.680 --> 57:36.400
 And people try to see if what he's doing

57:36.400 --> 57:37.400
 has anything to do with the strings.

57:37.400 --> 57:38.960
 Oh, yeah, indeed.

57:38.960 --> 57:40.880
 If I study scattering of two strings,

57:40.880 --> 57:42.840
 I get exactly the formula you wrote down.

57:42.840 --> 57:45.280
 That was the reinterpretation

57:45.280 --> 57:48.500
 of what he had written in the formula as the strings,

57:48.500 --> 57:51.120
 but still had nothing to do with gravity.

57:51.120 --> 57:53.400
 It had nothing to do with resolving the problems

57:53.400 --> 57:55.200
 of gravity with quantum mechanics.

57:55.200 --> 57:57.600
 It was just trying to explain a process

57:57.600 --> 58:01.160
 that people were seeing in hydronic physics collisions.

58:01.160 --> 58:04.420
 So it took a few more years to get to that point.

58:04.420 --> 58:07.460
 They did notice that,

58:07.460 --> 58:10.340
 physicists noticed that whenever you try to find

58:10.340 --> 58:13.420
 the spectrum of strings, you always get a massless particle

58:13.420 --> 58:14.860
 which has exactly the properties

58:14.860 --> 58:16.940
 that the graviton is supposed to have.

58:16.940 --> 58:20.180
 And no particle in hydronic physics that had that property.

58:20.180 --> 58:22.740
 You are getting a massless graviton

58:22.740 --> 58:25.720
 as part of this scattering without looking for it.

58:25.720 --> 58:27.520
 It was forced on you.

58:27.520 --> 58:29.760
 People were not trying to solve quantum gravity.

58:29.760 --> 58:31.860
 Quantum gravity was pushed on them.

58:31.860 --> 58:33.360
 I don't want this graviton.

58:33.360 --> 58:34.200
 Get rid of it.

58:34.200 --> 58:36.100
 They couldn't get rid of it.

58:36.100 --> 58:38.380
 They gave up trying to get rid of it.

58:38.380 --> 58:39.860
 Physicists, Sherk and Schwartz said,

58:39.860 --> 58:43.340
 you know what, string theory is theory of quantum gravity.

58:43.340 --> 58:45.700
 They've changed their perspective altogether.

58:45.700 --> 58:47.620
 We are not describing the hydronic physics.

58:47.620 --> 58:49.820
 We are describing this theory of quantum gravity.

58:49.820 --> 58:54.140
 And that's when string theory probably got like exciting

58:54.140 --> 58:56.380
 that this could be the unifying theory.

58:56.380 --> 58:57.820
 Exactly, it got exciting,

58:57.820 --> 58:59.520
 but at the same time, not so fast.

58:59.520 --> 59:02.860
 Namely, it should have been fast, but it wasn't

59:02.860 --> 59:05.100
 because particle physics through quantum field theory

59:05.100 --> 59:07.100
 were so successful at that time.

59:07.100 --> 59:10.060
 This is mid seventies, standard model of physics,

59:10.060 --> 59:12.860
 electromagnetism and unification of electromagnetic forces

59:12.860 --> 59:15.100
 with all the other forces were beginning to take place

59:15.100 --> 59:16.380
 without the gravity part.

59:17.380 --> 59:20.900
 Everything was working beautifully for particle physics.

59:20.900 --> 59:23.160
 And so that was the shining golden age

59:23.160 --> 59:25.260
 of quantum field theory and all the experiments,

59:25.260 --> 59:27.980
 standard model, this and that, unification,

59:27.980 --> 59:29.820
 spontaneous symmetry breaking was taking place.

59:29.820 --> 59:31.020
 All of them was nice.

59:31.020 --> 59:32.340
 This was kind of like a side show

59:32.340 --> 59:34.380
 and nobody was paying so much attention.

59:34.380 --> 59:37.300
 This exotic string is needed for quantum gravity.

59:37.300 --> 59:39.520
 Maybe there's other ways, maybe we should do something else.

59:39.520 --> 59:41.940
 So, yeah, it wasn't paid much attention to.

59:41.940 --> 59:44.060
 And this took a little bit more effort

59:44.060 --> 59:48.060
 to try to actually connect it to reality.

59:48.060 --> 59:49.100
 There are a few more steps.

59:49.100 --> 59:51.280
 First of all, there was a puzzle

59:51.280 --> 59:53.940
 that you were getting extra dimensions.

59:53.940 --> 59:55.600
 String was not working well

59:55.600 --> 59:57.820
 with three spatial dimension on one time.

59:57.820 --> 59:59.140
 It needed extra dimension.

59:59.140 --> 1:00:02.500
 Now, there are different versions of strings,

1:00:02.500 --> 1:00:04.780
 but the version that ended up being related

1:00:04.780 --> 1:00:06.820
 to having particles like electron,

1:00:06.820 --> 1:00:09.340
 what we call fermions, needed 10 dimensions,

1:00:09.340 --> 1:00:11.220
 what we call super string.

1:00:12.220 --> 1:00:13.060
 Now, why super?

1:00:13.060 --> 1:00:13.900
 Why the word super?

1:00:13.900 --> 1:00:17.340
 It turns out this version of the string,

1:00:17.340 --> 1:00:20.100
 which had fermions, had an extra symmetry,

1:00:21.340 --> 1:00:22.840
 which we call supersymmetry.

1:00:23.740 --> 1:00:27.940
 This is a symmetry between a particle and another particle

1:00:27.940 --> 1:00:29.620
 with exactly the same properties,

1:00:29.620 --> 1:00:31.660
 same mass, same charge, et cetera.

1:00:31.660 --> 1:00:33.060
 The only difference is that one of them

1:00:33.060 --> 1:00:35.820
 has a little different spin than the other one.

1:00:35.820 --> 1:00:38.780
 And one of them is a boson, one of them is a fermion

1:00:38.780 --> 1:00:41.060
 because of that shift of spin.

1:00:41.060 --> 1:00:42.100
 Otherwise, they're identical.

1:00:42.100 --> 1:00:43.560
 So there was this symmetry.

1:00:43.560 --> 1:00:45.520
 String theory had this symmetry.

1:00:45.520 --> 1:00:48.340
 In fact, supersymmetry was discovered

1:00:48.340 --> 1:00:50.440
 through string theory, theoretically.

1:00:51.540 --> 1:00:53.860
 So theoretically, the first place that this was observed

1:00:53.860 --> 1:00:57.700
 when you were describing these fermionic strings.

1:00:57.700 --> 1:01:00.220
 So that was the beginning of the study of supersymmetry

1:01:00.220 --> 1:01:02.180
 was via string theory.

1:01:02.180 --> 1:01:05.020
 And then it had remarkable properties

1:01:05.020 --> 1:01:07.220
 that the symmetry meant and so forth

1:01:07.220 --> 1:01:10.680
 that people began studying supersymmetry after that.

1:01:10.680 --> 1:01:13.580
 And that was a kind of a tangent direction

1:01:13.580 --> 1:01:15.720
 at the beginning for string theory.

1:01:15.720 --> 1:01:17.940
 But people in particle physics started also thinking,

1:01:17.940 --> 1:01:19.040
 oh, supersymmetry is great.

1:01:19.040 --> 1:01:21.060
 Let's see if we can have supersymmetry

1:01:21.060 --> 1:01:22.380
 in particle physics and so forth.

1:01:22.380 --> 1:01:23.260
 Forget about strings.

1:01:23.260 --> 1:01:25.700
 And they developed on a different track as well.

1:01:25.700 --> 1:01:27.660
 Supersymmetry in different models

1:01:27.660 --> 1:01:29.100
 became a subject on its own right,

1:01:29.100 --> 1:01:32.260
 understanding supersymmetry and what does this mean?

1:01:32.260 --> 1:01:34.100
 Because it unified bosons and fermion,

1:01:34.100 --> 1:01:36.040
 unified some ideas together.

1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:39.140
 So photon is a boson, electron is a fermion.

1:01:39.140 --> 1:01:41.540
 Could things like that be somehow related?

1:01:41.540 --> 1:01:43.660
 It was a kind of a natural kind of a question

1:01:43.660 --> 1:01:44.940
 to try to kind of unify

1:01:44.940 --> 1:01:48.100
 because in physics, we love unification.

1:01:48.100 --> 1:01:50.220
 Now, gradually, string theory was beginning

1:01:50.220 --> 1:01:51.700
 to show signs of unification.

1:01:51.700 --> 1:01:54.820
 It had graviton, but people found that you also have

1:01:54.820 --> 1:01:56.500
 things like photons in them,

1:01:56.500 --> 1:01:59.100
 different excitations of string behave like photons,

1:01:59.100 --> 1:02:01.100
 another one behaves like electron.

1:02:01.100 --> 1:02:04.740
 So a single string was unifying all these particles

1:02:04.740 --> 1:02:06.340
 into one object.

1:02:06.340 --> 1:02:07.380
 That's remarkable.

1:02:08.580 --> 1:02:10.580
 It's in 10 dimensions though.

1:02:10.580 --> 1:02:11.740
 It is not our universe

1:02:11.740 --> 1:02:13.500
 because we live in three plus one dimension.

1:02:13.500 --> 1:02:15.580
 How could that be possibly true?

1:02:15.580 --> 1:02:18.220
 So this was a conundrum.

1:02:18.220 --> 1:02:19.940
 It was elegant, it was beautiful,

1:02:19.940 --> 1:02:21.940
 but it was very specific

1:02:21.940 --> 1:02:23.600
 about which dimension you're getting,

1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:25.060
 which structure you're getting.

1:02:25.060 --> 1:02:27.660
 It wasn't saying, oh, you just put D equals to four,

1:02:27.660 --> 1:02:29.540
 you'll get your space time dimension that you want.

1:02:29.540 --> 1:02:30.900
 No, it didn't like that.

1:02:30.900 --> 1:02:34.300
 It said, I want 10 dimensions and that's the way it is.

1:02:34.300 --> 1:02:35.700
 So it was very specific.

1:02:35.700 --> 1:02:37.660
 Now, so people try to reconcile this

1:02:37.660 --> 1:02:39.340
 by the idea that, you know,

1:02:39.340 --> 1:02:41.980
 maybe these extra dimensions are tiny.

1:02:41.980 --> 1:02:45.260
 So if you take three macroscopic spatial dimensions

1:02:45.260 --> 1:02:49.460
 on one time and six extra tiny spatial dimensions,

1:02:49.460 --> 1:02:51.760
 like tiny spheres or tiny circles,

1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:55.980
 then it avoids contradiction with manifest fact

1:02:55.980 --> 1:02:59.740
 that we haven't seen extra dimensions in experiments today.

1:02:59.740 --> 1:03:03.060
 So that was a way to avoid conflict.

1:03:03.060 --> 1:03:05.900
 Now, this was a way to avoid conflict,

1:03:05.900 --> 1:03:09.300
 but it was not observed in experiments.

1:03:09.300 --> 1:03:10.580
 A string observed in experiments?

1:03:10.580 --> 1:03:12.040
 No, because it's so small.

1:03:12.980 --> 1:03:16.020
 So it's beginning to sound a little bit funny.

1:03:16.020 --> 1:03:19.620
 Similar feeling to the way perhaps Dirac had felt

1:03:19.620 --> 1:03:21.900
 about this positron plus or minus, you know,

1:03:21.900 --> 1:03:24.180
 it was beginning to sound a little bit like,

1:03:24.180 --> 1:03:25.900
 oh yeah, not only I have to have 10 dimension,

1:03:25.900 --> 1:03:28.660
 but I have to have this, I have to also this.

1:03:28.660 --> 1:03:31.140
 And so conservative physicists would say,

1:03:31.140 --> 1:03:34.340
 hmm, you know, I haven't seen these experiments.

1:03:34.340 --> 1:03:35.860
 I don't know if they are really there.

1:03:35.860 --> 1:03:37.740
 Are you pulling my leg?

1:03:37.740 --> 1:03:40.480
 Do you want me to imagine things that are not there?

1:03:40.480 --> 1:03:42.900
 So this was an attitude of some physicists

1:03:42.900 --> 1:03:45.380
 towards string theory, despite the fact

1:03:45.380 --> 1:03:47.620
 that the puzzle of gravity and quantum mechanics

1:03:47.620 --> 1:03:50.900
 merging together work, but still was this skepticism.

1:03:50.900 --> 1:03:52.540
 You're putting all these things that you want me

1:03:52.540 --> 1:03:54.220
 to imagine there, these extra dimensions

1:03:54.220 --> 1:03:56.020
 that I cannot see, aha, aha.

1:03:56.020 --> 1:03:57.260
 And you want me to believe that string

1:03:57.260 --> 1:03:59.060
 that you have not even seen the experiments are real,

1:03:59.060 --> 1:04:01.140
 aha, okay, what else do you want me to believe?

1:04:01.140 --> 1:04:03.380
 So this kind of beginning to sound a little funny.

1:04:03.380 --> 1:04:07.140
 Now, I will pass forward a little bit further.

1:04:08.820 --> 1:04:11.300
 A few decades later, when string theory became

1:04:11.300 --> 1:04:13.980
 the mainstream of efforts to unify the forces

1:04:13.980 --> 1:04:16.500
 and particles together, we learned

1:04:16.500 --> 1:04:20.780
 that these extra dimensions actually solved problems.

1:04:20.780 --> 1:04:24.380
 They weren't a nuisance the way they originally appeared.

1:04:24.380 --> 1:04:28.020
 First of all, the properties of these extra dimensions

1:04:28.020 --> 1:04:31.460
 reflected the number of particles we got in four dimensions.

1:04:31.460 --> 1:04:34.280
 If you took these six dimensions to have like five holes

1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:37.020
 or four holes, change the number of particles

1:04:37.020 --> 1:04:39.460
 that you see in four dimensional space time,

1:04:39.460 --> 1:04:42.060
 you get one electron and one muon if you had this,

1:04:42.060 --> 1:04:44.580
 but if you did the other J shape, you get something else.

1:04:44.580 --> 1:04:47.700
 So geometrically, you could get different kinds of physics.

1:04:47.700 --> 1:04:51.860
 So it was kind of a mirroring of geometry by physics

1:04:51.860 --> 1:04:53.400
 down in the macroscopic space.

1:04:53.400 --> 1:04:56.780
 So these extra dimension were becoming useful.

1:04:56.780 --> 1:04:58.820
 Fine, but we didn't need the extra dimension

1:04:58.820 --> 1:05:00.620
 to just write an electron in three dimensions,

1:05:00.620 --> 1:05:02.820
 we did rewrote it, so what?

1:05:02.820 --> 1:05:04.260
 Was there any other puzzle?

1:05:04.260 --> 1:05:07.140
 Yes, there were, Hawking.

1:05:07.140 --> 1:05:09.700
 Hawking had been studying black holes in mid 70s

1:05:10.900 --> 1:05:12.840
 following the work of Bekenstein,

1:05:12.840 --> 1:05:17.840
 who had predicted that black holes have entropy.

1:05:17.940 --> 1:05:20.260
 So Bekenstein had tried to attach the entropy

1:05:20.260 --> 1:05:21.540
 to the black hole.

1:05:21.540 --> 1:05:23.860
 If you throw something into the black hole,

1:05:23.860 --> 1:05:25.320
 the entropy seems to go down

1:05:25.320 --> 1:05:28.020
 because you had something entropy outside the black hole

1:05:28.020 --> 1:05:30.740
 and you throw it, black hole was unique,

1:05:30.740 --> 1:05:33.500
 so the entropy did not have any, black hole had no entropy.

1:05:33.500 --> 1:05:35.980
 So the entropy seemed to go down.

1:05:35.980 --> 1:05:38.040
 And so that's against the laws of thermodynamics.

1:05:38.040 --> 1:05:40.040
 So Bekenstein was trying to say, no, no,

1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:42.140
 therefore black hole must have an entropy.

1:05:42.140 --> 1:05:43.860
 So he was trying to understand that he found that

1:05:43.860 --> 1:05:47.180
 if you assign entropy to be proportional

1:05:47.180 --> 1:05:49.220
 to the area of the black hole, it seems to work.

1:05:49.220 --> 1:05:52.640
 And then Hawking found not only that's correct,

1:05:52.640 --> 1:05:54.940
 he found the correct proportionality factor

1:05:54.940 --> 1:05:57.060
 of a one quarter of the area and Planck units

1:05:57.060 --> 1:05:59.400
 is the correct amount of entropy.

1:05:59.400 --> 1:06:01.100
 And he gave an argument using

1:06:01.100 --> 1:06:03.300
 quantum semi classical arguments,

1:06:03.300 --> 1:06:05.660
 which means basically using a little bit

1:06:05.660 --> 1:06:06.880
 of a quantum mechanics,

1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:09.020
 because he didn't have the full quantum mechanics

1:06:09.020 --> 1:06:11.060
 of string theory, he could do some aspects

1:06:11.060 --> 1:06:12.940
 of approximate quantum arguments.

1:06:12.940 --> 1:06:14.860
 So he heuristic quantum arguments led

1:06:14.860 --> 1:06:16.540
 to this entropy formula.

1:06:17.400 --> 1:06:20.780
 But then he didn't answer the following question.

1:06:20.780 --> 1:06:23.380
 He was getting a big entropy for the black hole,

1:06:23.380 --> 1:06:25.020
 the black hole with the size of the horizon

1:06:25.020 --> 1:06:27.700
 of a black hole is huge, has a huge amount of entropy.

1:06:27.700 --> 1:06:29.660
 What are the microstates of this entropy?

1:06:29.660 --> 1:06:32.260
 When you say, for example, the gas is entropy,

1:06:32.260 --> 1:06:33.780
 you count where the atoms are,

1:06:33.780 --> 1:06:35.540
 you count this bucket or that bucket,

1:06:35.540 --> 1:06:38.660
 there's an information about there and so on, you count them.

1:06:38.660 --> 1:06:40.820
 For the black hole, the way Hawking was thinking,

1:06:40.820 --> 1:06:43.180
 there was no degree of freedom, you throw them in,

1:06:43.180 --> 1:06:44.500
 and there was just one solution.

1:06:44.500 --> 1:06:46.700
 So where are these entropy?

1:06:46.700 --> 1:06:49.060
 What are these microscopic states?

1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:51.940
 They were hidden somewhere.

1:06:51.940 --> 1:06:54.340
 So later in string theory,

1:06:54.340 --> 1:06:57.620
 the work that we did with my colleague Strominger,

1:06:57.620 --> 1:07:00.500
 in particular showed that these ingredients

1:07:00.500 --> 1:07:04.340
 in string theory of black hole arise

1:07:04.340 --> 1:07:06.080
 from the extra dimensions.

1:07:06.080 --> 1:07:08.300
 So the degrees of freedom are hidden

1:07:08.300 --> 1:07:10.020
 in terms of things like strings,

1:07:10.020 --> 1:07:13.660
 wrapping these extra circles in these hidden dimensions.

1:07:13.660 --> 1:07:16.020
 And then we started counting how many ways

1:07:16.020 --> 1:07:18.180
 like the strings can wrap around this circle

1:07:18.180 --> 1:07:19.960
 and the extra dimension or that circle

1:07:19.960 --> 1:07:22.460
 and counted the microscopic degrees of freedom.

1:07:22.460 --> 1:07:24.780
 And lo and behold, we got the microscopic degrees

1:07:24.780 --> 1:07:27.760
 of freedom that Hawking was predicting four dimensions.

1:07:27.760 --> 1:07:30.180
 So the extra dimensions became useful

1:07:30.180 --> 1:07:32.820
 for resolving a puzzle in four dimensions.

1:07:32.820 --> 1:07:35.340
 The puzzle was where are the degrees of freedom

1:07:35.340 --> 1:07:36.680
 of the black hole hidden?

1:07:36.680 --> 1:07:39.300
 The answer, hidden in the extra dimensions.

1:07:39.300 --> 1:07:41.020
 The tiny extra dimensions.

1:07:41.020 --> 1:07:43.820
 So then by this time, it was beginning to,

1:07:43.820 --> 1:07:46.160
 we see aspects that extra dimensions

1:07:46.160 --> 1:07:47.340
 are useful for many things.

1:07:47.340 --> 1:07:48.720
 It's not a nuisance.

1:07:48.720 --> 1:07:51.180
 It wasn't to be kind of, you know, be ashamed of.

1:07:51.180 --> 1:07:53.540
 It was actually in the welcome features.

1:07:53.540 --> 1:07:54.900
 New feature, nevertheless.

1:07:54.900 --> 1:07:59.580
 How do you intuit the 10 dimensional world?

1:07:59.580 --> 1:08:03.140
 So yes, it's a feature for describing certain phenomena

1:08:03.140 --> 1:08:06.380
 like the entropy in black holes,

1:08:06.380 --> 1:08:11.380
 but what you said that to you a theory becomes real

1:08:14.020 --> 1:08:16.380
 or becomes powerful when you can connect it

1:08:16.380 --> 1:08:18.200
 to some deep intuition.

1:08:18.200 --> 1:08:20.580
 So how do we intuit 10 dimensions?

1:08:20.580 --> 1:08:24.820
 Yes, so I will explain how some of the analogies work.

1:08:24.820 --> 1:08:27.840
 First of all, we do a lot of analogies.

1:08:28.740 --> 1:08:31.020
 And by analogies, we build intuition.

1:08:31.020 --> 1:08:33.260
 So I will start with this example.

1:08:33.260 --> 1:08:37.500
 I will try to explain that if we are in 10 dimensional space,

1:08:37.500 --> 1:08:40.260
 if we have a seven dimensional plane

1:08:40.260 --> 1:08:41.900
 and eight dimensional plane,

1:08:42.860 --> 1:08:45.580
 we ask typically in what space do they intersect each other

1:08:45.580 --> 1:08:46.720
 in what dimension?

1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:48.040
 That might sound like,

1:08:48.040 --> 1:08:50.540
 how do you possibly give an answer to this?

1:08:50.540 --> 1:08:52.440
 So we start with lower dimensions.

1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:53.620
 We start with two dimensions.

1:08:53.620 --> 1:08:56.540
 We say, if you have one dimension and a point,

1:08:56.540 --> 1:08:58.600
 do they intersect typically on a plane?

1:08:58.600 --> 1:08:59.440
 The answer is no.

1:08:59.440 --> 1:09:02.980
 So a line one dimensional, a point zero dimension

1:09:02.980 --> 1:09:05.780
 on a two dimensional plane, they don't typically meet.

1:09:05.780 --> 1:09:08.540
 But if you have a one dimensional line and another line,

1:09:08.540 --> 1:09:10.540
 which is one plus one on a plane,

1:09:10.540 --> 1:09:13.620
 they typically intersect at a point.

1:09:13.620 --> 1:09:15.140
 Typically means if you're not parallel,

1:09:15.140 --> 1:09:17.100
 typically they intersect at a point.

1:09:17.100 --> 1:09:20.620
 So one plus one is two and in two dimension,

1:09:20.620 --> 1:09:23.020
 they intersect at the zero dimensional point.

1:09:23.020 --> 1:09:25.740
 So you see two dimension, one and one, two,

1:09:25.740 --> 1:09:26.900
 two minus two is zero.

1:09:26.900 --> 1:09:29.860
 So you get point out of intersection.

1:09:29.860 --> 1:09:31.860
 Let's go to three dimension.

1:09:31.860 --> 1:09:33.860
 You have a plane, two dimensional plane and a point.

1:09:33.860 --> 1:09:34.700
 Do they intersect?

1:09:34.700 --> 1:09:35.860
 No, two and zero.

1:09:37.840 --> 1:09:39.420
 How about the plane and a line?

1:09:39.420 --> 1:09:41.420
 A plane is two dimensional and a line is one.

1:09:41.420 --> 1:09:42.980
 Two plus one is three.

1:09:42.980 --> 1:09:47.000
 In three dimension, a plane and a line meet at points,

1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:47.900
 which is zero dimensional.

1:09:47.900 --> 1:09:49.700
 Three minus three is zero.

1:09:49.700 --> 1:09:52.920
 Okay, so plane and a line intersect

1:09:52.920 --> 1:09:54.060
 at a point in three dimension.

1:09:54.060 --> 1:09:56.020
 How about the plane and a plane in 3D?

1:09:56.020 --> 1:09:57.660
 Well, plane is two and this is two.

1:09:57.660 --> 1:09:59.160
 Two plus two is four.

1:09:59.160 --> 1:10:01.040
 In 3D, four minus three is one.

1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:03.100
 They intersect on a one dimensional line.

1:10:03.100 --> 1:10:04.540
 Okay, we're beginning to see the pattern.

1:10:04.540 --> 1:10:06.060
 Okay, now come to the question.

1:10:06.060 --> 1:10:06.900
 We're in 10 dimension.

1:10:06.900 --> 1:10:08.100
 Now we have the intuition.

1:10:08.100 --> 1:10:09.380
 We have a seven dimensional plane

1:10:09.380 --> 1:10:11.540
 and eight dimensional plane in 10 dimension.

1:10:11.540 --> 1:10:13.140
 They intersect on a plane.

1:10:13.140 --> 1:10:14.020
 What's the dimension?

1:10:14.020 --> 1:10:16.860
 Well, seven plus eight is 15 minus 10 is five.

1:10:16.860 --> 1:10:20.320
 We draw the same picture as two planes

1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:22.520
 and we write seven dimension, eight dimension,

1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:23.940
 but we have gotten the intuition

1:10:23.940 --> 1:10:25.300
 from the lower dimensional one.

1:10:25.300 --> 1:10:26.980
 What to expect?

1:10:26.980 --> 1:10:28.660
 It doesn't scare us anymore.

1:10:28.660 --> 1:10:30.220
 So we draw this picture.

1:10:30.220 --> 1:10:32.700
 We cannot see all the seven dimensions

1:10:32.700 --> 1:10:36.220
 by looking at this two dimensional visualization of it,

1:10:36.220 --> 1:10:38.380
 but it has all the features we want.

1:10:38.380 --> 1:10:39.900
 It has, so we draw this picture.

1:10:39.900 --> 1:10:40.840
 It says seven, seven,

1:10:40.840 --> 1:10:43.660
 and they meet at the five dimensional plane.

1:10:43.660 --> 1:10:44.640
 It says five.

1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:46.540
 So we have built this intuition.

1:10:46.540 --> 1:10:51.540
 Now, this is an example of how we come up with intuition.

1:10:51.860 --> 1:10:53.260
 Let me give you more examples of it

1:10:53.260 --> 1:10:54.860
 because I think this will show you

1:10:54.860 --> 1:10:57.900
 that people have to come up with intuitions to visualize it.

1:10:57.900 --> 1:11:00.860
 Otherwise, we will be a little bit lost.

1:11:00.860 --> 1:11:02.940
 So what you just described is kind of

1:11:02.940 --> 1:11:04.280
 in these high dimensional spaces,

1:11:04.280 --> 1:11:08.780
 focus on the meeting place of two planes

1:11:08.780 --> 1:11:10.220
 in high dimensional spaces.

1:11:10.220 --> 1:11:12.220
 Exactly, how the planes meet, for example,

1:11:12.220 --> 1:11:14.760
 what's the dimension of their intersection and so on.

1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:16.620
 So how do we come up with intuition?

1:11:16.620 --> 1:11:19.580
 We borrow examples from lower dimensions,

1:11:19.580 --> 1:11:21.940
 build up intuition and draw the same pictures

1:11:21.940 --> 1:11:24.780
 as if we are talking about 10 dimensions,

1:11:24.780 --> 1:11:26.860
 but we are drawing the same as a two dimensional plane

1:11:26.860 --> 1:11:28.260
 because we cannot do any better.

1:11:28.260 --> 1:11:32.540
 But our words change, but not our pictures.

1:11:32.540 --> 1:11:35.820
 So your sense is we can have a deep understanding

1:11:35.820 --> 1:11:39.220
 of reality by looking at its slices,

1:11:39.220 --> 1:11:40.460
 at lower dimensional slices.

1:11:40.460 --> 1:11:41.780
 Exactly, exactly.

1:11:41.780 --> 1:11:45.200
 And this brings me to the next example I wanna mention,

1:11:45.200 --> 1:11:46.440
 which is sphere.

1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:48.580
 Let's think about how do we think about the sphere?

1:11:48.580 --> 1:11:51.460
 Well, the sphere is a sphere, the round nice thing,

1:11:51.460 --> 1:11:53.520
 but sphere has a circular symmetry.

1:11:53.520 --> 1:11:57.880
 Now, I can describe the sphere in the following way.

1:11:57.880 --> 1:12:01.520
 I can describe it by an interval,

1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:04.440
 which is thinking about this going from the north

1:12:04.440 --> 1:12:06.360
 of the sphere to the south.

1:12:06.360 --> 1:12:09.480
 And at each point, I have a circle attached to it.

1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:11.440
 So you can think about the sphere as a line

1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:13.920
 with a circle attached with each point,

1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:17.520
 the circle shrinks to a point at end points

1:12:17.520 --> 1:12:18.360
 of the interval.

1:12:18.360 --> 1:12:21.920
 So I can say, oh, one way to think about the sphere

1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:25.300
 is an interval where at each point on that interval,

1:12:25.300 --> 1:12:27.280
 there's another circle I'm not drawing.

1:12:27.280 --> 1:12:29.280
 But if you like, you can just draw it.

1:12:29.280 --> 1:12:30.200
 Say, okay, I won't draw it.

1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:32.520
 So from now on, there's this mnemonic.

1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:34.640
 I draw an interval when I wanna talk about the sphere

1:12:34.640 --> 1:12:37.240
 and you remember that the end points of the interval

1:12:37.240 --> 1:12:39.320
 mean a strong circle, that's all.

1:12:39.320 --> 1:12:41.280
 And they say, yeah, I see, that's a sphere, good.

1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:44.300
 Now, we wanna talk about the product of two spheres.

1:12:44.300 --> 1:12:47.040
 That's four dimensional, how can I visualize it?

1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:50.900
 Easy, you just take an interval and another interval,

1:12:50.900 --> 1:12:52.360
 that's just gonna be a square.

1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:57.600
 A square is a four dimensional space, yeah, why is that?

1:12:57.600 --> 1:13:02.160
 Well, at each point on the square, there's two circles,

1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:04.840
 one for each of those directions you drew.

1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:07.080
 And when you get to the boundaries of each direction,

1:13:07.080 --> 1:13:09.920
 one of the circles shrink on each edge of that square.

1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:11.680
 And when you get to the corners of the square,

1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:13.660
 all both circles shrink.

1:13:13.660 --> 1:13:17.480
 This is a sphere times a sphere, I have defined interval.

1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:20.240
 I just described for you a four dimensional space.

1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:21.640
 Do you want a six dimensional space?

1:13:21.640 --> 1:13:25.780
 No problem, take a corner of a room.

1:13:25.780 --> 1:13:28.160
 In fact, if you want to have a sphere times a sphere

1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:31.200
 times a sphere times a sphere, take a cube.

1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:36.800
 A cube is a rendition of this six dimensional space,

1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:39.320
 two sphere times another sphere times another sphere,

1:13:39.320 --> 1:13:41.860
 where three of the circles I'm not drawing for you.

1:13:41.860 --> 1:13:43.720
 For each one of those directions, there's another circle.

1:13:43.720 --> 1:13:45.880
 But each time you get to the boundary of the cube,

1:13:45.880 --> 1:13:47.080
 one circle shrinks.

1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:48.760
 When the boundaries meet, two circles shrinks.

1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:51.960
 When three boundaries meet, all the three circles shrink.

1:13:51.960 --> 1:13:53.320
 So I just give you a picture.

1:13:53.320 --> 1:13:55.900
 Now, mathematicians come up with amazing things.

1:13:55.900 --> 1:13:58.080
 Like, you know what, I want to take a point in space

1:13:58.080 --> 1:13:59.400
 and blow it up.

1:13:59.400 --> 1:14:01.920
 You know, these concepts like topology and geometry,

1:14:01.920 --> 1:14:03.520
 complicated, how do you do?

1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:05.360
 In this picture, it's very easy.

1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:07.840
 Blow it up in this picture means the following.

1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:10.280
 You think about this cube, you go to the corner

1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:12.640
 and you chop off a corner.

1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:15.160
 Chopping off the corner replaces the point.

1:14:15.160 --> 1:14:16.000
 Yeah.

1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:17.160
 Replace the point by a triangle.

1:14:17.160 --> 1:14:18.000
 Yes.

1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:19.760
 So you're blowing up a point and then this triangle

1:14:19.760 --> 1:14:22.320
 is what they call P2, projective two space.

1:14:22.320 --> 1:14:25.040
 But these pictures are very physical and you feel it.

1:14:25.040 --> 1:14:26.280
 There's nothing amazing.

1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:28.040
 I'm not talking about six dimension.

1:14:28.040 --> 1:14:30.520
 Four plus six is 10, the dimension of string theory.

1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:32.280
 So we can visualize it, no problem.

1:14:32.280 --> 1:14:34.280
 Okay, so that's building the intuition

1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:36.860
 to a complicated world of string theory.

1:14:36.860 --> 1:14:39.940
 Nevertheless, these objects are really small.

1:14:39.940 --> 1:14:42.520
 And just like you said, experimental validation

1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:45.360
 is very difficult because the objects are way smaller

1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:48.320
 than anything that we currently have the tools

1:14:48.320 --> 1:14:53.320
 and accelerators and so on to reveal through experiment.

1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:56.280
 So there's a kind of skepticism

1:14:56.280 --> 1:14:59.340
 that's not just about the nature of the theory

1:14:59.340 --> 1:15:01.800
 because of the 10 dimensions, as you've explained,

1:15:01.800 --> 1:15:05.000
 but in that we can't experimentally validate it

1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.480
 and it doesn't necessarily, to date,

1:15:07.480 --> 1:15:09.000
 maybe you can correct me,

1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:12.040
 predict something fundamentally new.

1:15:12.040 --> 1:15:16.080
 So it's beautiful as an explaining theory,

1:15:16.080 --> 1:15:18.200
 which means that it's very possible

1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:19.880
 that it is a fundamental theory

1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:22.580
 that describes reality and unifies the laws,

1:15:22.580 --> 1:15:25.500
 but there's still a kind of skepticism.

1:15:25.500 --> 1:15:30.500
 And me, from sort of an outside observer perspective,

1:15:30.900 --> 1:15:34.320
 have been observing a little bit of a growing cynicism

1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:37.300
 about string theory in the recent few years.

1:15:37.300 --> 1:15:40.080
 Can you describe the cynicism about,

1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:42.760
 sort of by cynicism I mean a cynicism

1:15:42.760 --> 1:15:46.440
 about the hope for this theory

1:15:46.440 --> 1:15:49.840
 of pushing theoretical physics forward?

1:15:49.840 --> 1:15:50.800
 Yes.

1:15:50.800 --> 1:15:53.960
 Can you do describe why this is cynicism

1:15:53.960 --> 1:15:56.040
 and how do we reverse that trend?

1:15:56.040 --> 1:16:00.500
 Yes, first of all, the criticism for string theory

1:16:01.520 --> 1:16:04.600
 is healthy in a sense that in science

1:16:04.600 --> 1:16:07.260
 we have to have different viewpoints and that's good.

1:16:07.260 --> 1:16:12.260
 So I welcome criticism and the reason for criticism

1:16:12.440 --> 1:16:13.880
 and I think that is a valid reason

1:16:13.880 --> 1:16:15.880
 is that there has been zero experimental evidence

1:16:15.880 --> 1:16:17.120
 for string theory.

1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:20.300
 That is no experiment has been done

1:16:20.300 --> 1:16:24.080
 to show that there's this loop of energy moving around.

1:16:24.080 --> 1:16:28.520
 And so that's a valid objection and valid worry.

1:16:28.520 --> 1:16:30.240
 And if I were to say, you know what,

1:16:30.240 --> 1:16:31.800
 string theory can never be verified

1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:34.480
 or experimentally checked, that's the way it is,

1:16:34.480 --> 1:16:36.280
 they would have every right to say

1:16:36.280 --> 1:16:37.840
 what you're talking about is not science.

1:16:37.840 --> 1:16:39.740
 Because in science we will have to have

1:16:39.740 --> 1:16:42.360
 experimental consequences and checks.

1:16:42.360 --> 1:16:44.600
 The difference between string theory

1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:45.780
 and something which is not scientific

1:16:45.780 --> 1:16:47.660
 is that string theory has predictions.

1:16:47.660 --> 1:16:49.660
 The problem is that the predictions we have today

1:16:49.660 --> 1:16:52.960
 of string theory is hard to access by experiments

1:16:52.960 --> 1:16:55.220
 available with the energies we can achieve

1:16:55.220 --> 1:16:56.680
 with the colliders today.

1:16:56.680 --> 1:16:58.360
 It doesn't mean there's a problem with string theory,

1:16:58.360 --> 1:17:01.640
 it just means technologically we're not that far ahead.

1:17:01.640 --> 1:17:04.320
 Now, we can have two attitudes.

1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:06.780
 You say, well, if that's the case, why are you studying

1:17:06.780 --> 1:17:07.620
 this subject?

1:17:07.620 --> 1:17:09.440
 Because you can't do experiment today.

1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:12.480
 Now, this is becoming a little bit more like mathematics

1:17:12.480 --> 1:17:13.320
 in that sense.

1:17:13.320 --> 1:17:15.400
 You say, well, I want to learn,

1:17:15.400 --> 1:17:16.680
 I want to know how the nature works

1:17:16.680 --> 1:17:18.520
 even though I cannot prove it today

1:17:18.520 --> 1:17:21.060
 that this is it because of experiments.

1:17:21.060 --> 1:17:24.240
 That should not prevent my mind not to think about it.

1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:26.260
 So that's the attitude many string theorists follow,

1:17:26.260 --> 1:17:28.220
 that it should be like this.

1:17:28.220 --> 1:17:30.940
 Now, so that's an answer to the criticism,

1:17:30.940 --> 1:17:33.000
 but there's actually a better answer to the criticism,

1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:34.120
 I would say.

1:17:34.120 --> 1:17:37.440
 We don't have experimental evidence for string theory,

1:17:37.440 --> 1:17:39.320
 but we have theoretical evidence for string theory.

1:17:39.320 --> 1:17:41.640
 And what do I mean by theoretical evidence

1:17:41.640 --> 1:17:42.920
 for string theory?

1:17:42.920 --> 1:17:45.260
 String theory has connected different parts

1:17:45.260 --> 1:17:46.320
 of physics together.

1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:48.680
 It didn't have to.

1:17:49.680 --> 1:17:52.160
 It has brought connections between part of physics,

1:17:52.160 --> 1:17:53.600
 although suppose you're just interested

1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:54.760
 in particle physics.

1:17:54.760 --> 1:17:57.880
 Suppose you're not even interested in gravity at all.

1:17:57.880 --> 1:17:59.720
 It turns out there are properties

1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:02.360
 of certain particle physics models

1:18:02.360 --> 1:18:06.080
 that string theory has been able to solve using gravity,

1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:08.200
 using ideas from string theory,

1:18:08.200 --> 1:18:10.680
 ideas known as holography,

1:18:10.680 --> 1:18:13.160
 which is relating something which has to do with particles

1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:15.600
 to something having to do with gravity.

1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:17.760
 Why did it have to be this rich?

1:18:17.760 --> 1:18:20.240
 The subject is very rich.

1:18:20.240 --> 1:18:23.000
 It's not something we were smart enough to develop.

1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:23.840
 It came at us.

1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:24.660
 As I explained to you,

1:18:24.660 --> 1:18:25.720
 the development of string theory

1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:28.080
 came from accidental discovery.

1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:29.760
 It wasn't because we were smart enough

1:18:29.760 --> 1:18:30.840
 to come up with the idea,

1:18:30.840 --> 1:18:32.360
 oh yeah, string of course has gravity in it.

1:18:32.360 --> 1:18:34.480
 No, it was accidental discovery.

1:18:34.480 --> 1:18:36.160
 So some people say it's not fair to say

1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:38.120
 we have no evidence for string theory.

1:18:38.120 --> 1:18:41.280
 Graviton, gravity is an evidence for string theory.

1:18:41.280 --> 1:18:43.280
 It's predicted by string theory.

1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:45.840
 We didn't put it by hand, we got it.

1:18:45.840 --> 1:18:47.920
 So there's a qualitative check.

1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:51.080
 Okay, gravity is a prediction of string theory.

1:18:51.080 --> 1:18:53.640
 It's a postdiction because we know gravity existed.

1:18:53.640 --> 1:18:56.760
 But still, logically it is a prediction

1:18:56.760 --> 1:19:00.000
 because really we didn't know it had the graviton

1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:02.760
 that we later learned that, oh, that's the same as gravity.

1:19:02.760 --> 1:19:04.480
 So literally that's the way it was discovered.

1:19:04.480 --> 1:19:06.280
 It wasn't put in by hand.

1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:08.480
 So there are many things like that,

1:19:08.480 --> 1:19:11.480
 that there are different facets of physics,

1:19:11.480 --> 1:19:13.400
 like questions in condensed matter physics,

1:19:13.400 --> 1:19:15.280
 questions of particle physics,

1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:18.060
 questions about this and that have come together

1:19:18.060 --> 1:19:21.320
 to find beautiful answers by using ideas

1:19:21.320 --> 1:19:24.320
 from string theory at the same time

1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:27.080
 as a lot of new math has emerged.

1:19:27.080 --> 1:19:29.660
 That's an aspect which I wouldn't emphasize

1:19:29.660 --> 1:19:31.920
 as evidence to physicists necessarily,

1:19:31.920 --> 1:19:33.860
 because they would say, okay, great, you got some math,

1:19:33.860 --> 1:19:35.580
 but what's it do with reality?

1:19:35.580 --> 1:19:38.680
 But as I explained, many of the physical principles

1:19:38.680 --> 1:19:41.700
 we know of have beautiful math underpinning them.

1:19:41.700 --> 1:19:45.200
 So it certainly leads further confidence

1:19:45.200 --> 1:19:46.820
 that we may not be going astray,

1:19:46.820 --> 1:19:49.200
 even though that's not the full proof as we know.

1:19:49.200 --> 1:19:52.280
 So there are these aspects that give further evidence

1:19:52.280 --> 1:19:55.300
 for string theory, connections between each other,

1:19:55.300 --> 1:19:56.260
 connection with the real world,

1:19:56.260 --> 1:19:58.480
 but then there are other things that come about

1:19:58.480 --> 1:20:01.120
 and I can try to give examples of that.

1:20:01.120 --> 1:20:03.000
 So these are further evidences

1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:05.840
 and these are certain predictions of string theory.

1:20:05.840 --> 1:20:08.880
 They are not as detailed as we want,

1:20:08.880 --> 1:20:10.520
 but there are still predictions.

1:20:11.760 --> 1:20:14.920
 Why is the dimension of space and time three plus one?

1:20:16.800 --> 1:20:20.160
 Say, I don't know, just deal with it, three plus one.

1:20:20.160 --> 1:20:23.320
 But in physics, we want to know why.

1:20:23.320 --> 1:20:26.520
 Well, take a random dimension from one to infinity.

1:20:26.520 --> 1:20:28.740
 What's your random dimension?

1:20:28.740 --> 1:20:32.180
 A random dimension from one to infinity would not be four.

1:20:33.320 --> 1:20:35.640
 Eight would most likely be a humongous number,

1:20:35.640 --> 1:20:36.480
 if not infinity.

1:20:36.480 --> 1:20:39.640
 I mean, there's no, if you choose any reasonable distribution

1:20:39.640 --> 1:20:41.340
 which goes from one to infinity,

1:20:41.340 --> 1:20:43.200
 three or four would not be your pick.

1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:45.900
 The fact that we are in three or four dimension

1:20:45.900 --> 1:20:47.420
 is already strange.

1:20:48.540 --> 1:20:49.880
 The fact that strings are sorry,

1:20:49.880 --> 1:20:52.720
 I cannot go beyond 10 or maybe 11 or something.

1:20:52.720 --> 1:20:54.620
 The fact that there's this upper bound,

1:20:54.620 --> 1:20:56.280
 the range is not from one to infinity,

1:20:56.280 --> 1:20:58.720
 it's from one to 10 or 11 or whatnot,

1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:00.720
 it already brings a natural prior.

1:21:00.720 --> 1:21:03.200
 Oh yeah, three or four is just on the average.

1:21:03.200 --> 1:21:05.120
 If you pick some of the compactification,

1:21:05.120 --> 1:21:06.040
 then it could easily be that.

1:21:06.040 --> 1:21:08.880
 So in other words, it makes it much more possible

1:21:08.880 --> 1:21:11.080
 that it could be three of our universe.

1:21:11.080 --> 1:21:14.240
 So the fact that the dimension already is so small,

1:21:14.240 --> 1:21:16.000
 it should be surprising.

1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:17.440
 We don't ask that question.

1:21:17.440 --> 1:21:20.360
 We should be surprised because we could have conceived

1:21:20.360 --> 1:21:22.440
 of universes with our pre dimension.

1:21:22.440 --> 1:21:24.280
 Why is it that we have such a small dimension?

1:21:24.280 --> 1:21:25.520
 That's number one.

1:21:25.520 --> 1:21:28.760
 So good theory of the universe should give you

1:21:28.760 --> 1:21:33.600
 an intuition of the why it's four or three plus one.

1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:36.120
 And it's not obvious that it should be.

1:21:36.120 --> 1:21:37.200
 That should be explained.

1:21:37.200 --> 1:21:40.520
 We take that as an assumption,

1:21:40.520 --> 1:21:43.360
 but that's a thing that should be explained.

1:21:43.360 --> 1:21:45.040
 Yeah, so we haven't explained that in string theory.

1:21:45.040 --> 1:21:47.440
 Actually, I did write a model within string theory

1:21:47.440 --> 1:21:49.040
 to try to describe why we end up

1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:52.520
 with three plus one space time dimensions,

1:21:52.520 --> 1:21:54.720
 which are big compared to the rest of them.

1:21:54.720 --> 1:21:57.000
 And even though this has not been,

1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:00.240
 the technical difficulties to prove it is still not there,

1:22:00.240 --> 1:22:02.640
 but I will explain the idea because the idea connects

1:22:02.640 --> 1:22:05.360
 to some other piece of elegant math,

1:22:05.360 --> 1:22:06.280
 which is the following.

1:22:06.280 --> 1:22:11.280
 Consider a universe made of a box, three dimensional box.

1:22:11.480 --> 1:22:13.280
 Or in fact, if we start in string theory,

1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:14.280
 nine dimensional box,

1:22:14.280 --> 1:22:17.200
 because we have nine spatial dimension on one time.

1:22:17.200 --> 1:22:20.240
 So imagine a nine dimensional box.

1:22:20.240 --> 1:22:23.880
 So we should imagine the box of a typical size of the string,

1:22:23.880 --> 1:22:25.600
 which is small.

1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:27.640
 So the universe would naturally start

1:22:27.640 --> 1:22:29.640
 with a very tiny nine dimensional box.

1:22:30.520 --> 1:22:31.400
 What do strings do?

1:22:31.400 --> 1:22:34.000
 Well, strings go around the box

1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:35.360
 and move around and vibrate and all that,

1:22:35.360 --> 1:22:38.600
 but also they can wrap around one side of the box

1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:41.400
 to the other because I'm imagining a box

1:22:41.400 --> 1:22:42.760
 with periodic boundary conditions.

1:22:42.760 --> 1:22:44.600
 So what we call the torus.

1:22:44.600 --> 1:22:46.960
 So the string can go from one side to the other.

1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:48.520
 This is what we call a winding string.

1:22:48.520 --> 1:22:50.400
 The string can wind around the box.

1:22:50.400 --> 1:22:54.200
 Now, suppose you have, you've now evolved the universe.

1:22:54.200 --> 1:22:56.800
 Because there's energy, the universe starts to expand.

1:22:57.640 --> 1:23:00.240
 But it doesn't expand too far.

1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:01.320
 Why is it?

1:23:01.320 --> 1:23:03.800
 Well, because there are these strings

1:23:03.800 --> 1:23:04.720
 which are wrapped around

1:23:04.720 --> 1:23:07.120
 from one side of the wall to the other.

1:23:07.120 --> 1:23:10.440
 When the universe, the walls of the universe are growing,

1:23:10.440 --> 1:23:11.960
 it is stretching the string

1:23:11.960 --> 1:23:15.040
 and the strings are becoming very, very massive.

1:23:15.040 --> 1:23:16.840
 So it becomes difficult to expand.

1:23:16.840 --> 1:23:18.320
 It kind of puts a halt on it.

1:23:18.320 --> 1:23:19.880
 In order to not put a halt,

1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:21.280
 a string which is going this way

1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:22.720
 and a string which is going that way

1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:25.400
 should intersect each other

1:23:25.400 --> 1:23:27.840
 and disconnect each other and unwind.

1:23:27.840 --> 1:23:29.640
 So a string which winds this way

1:23:29.640 --> 1:23:31.720
 and the string which finds the opposite way

1:23:31.720 --> 1:23:35.400
 should find each other to reconnect

1:23:35.400 --> 1:23:37.080
 and this way disappear.

1:23:37.080 --> 1:23:40.560
 So if they find each other and they disappear.

1:23:40.560 --> 1:23:42.120
 But how can strings find each other?

1:23:42.120 --> 1:23:45.480
 Well, the string moves and another string moves.

1:23:45.480 --> 1:23:48.600
 A string is one dimensional, one plus one is two

1:23:48.600 --> 1:23:52.280
 and one plus one is two and two plus two is four.

1:23:52.280 --> 1:23:55.600
 In four dimensional space time, they will find each other.

1:23:55.600 --> 1:23:57.360
 In a higher dimensional space time,

1:23:57.360 --> 1:23:59.400
 they typically miss each other.

1:23:59.400 --> 1:24:00.240
 Oh, interesting.

1:24:00.240 --> 1:24:01.800
 So if the dimension were too big,

1:24:01.800 --> 1:24:02.800
 they would miss each other,

1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:04.480
 they wouldn't be able to expand.

1:24:04.480 --> 1:24:06.760
 So in order to expand, they have to find each other

1:24:06.760 --> 1:24:08.920
 and three of them can find each other

1:24:08.920 --> 1:24:10.960
 and those can expand and the other one will be stuck.

1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:13.200
 So that explains why within string theory,

1:24:13.200 --> 1:24:15.520
 these particular dimensions are really big

1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:16.680
 and full of exciting stuff.

1:24:16.680 --> 1:24:17.800
 That could be an explanation.

1:24:17.800 --> 1:24:21.800
 That's a model we suggested with my colleague Brandenberger.

1:24:21.800 --> 1:24:23.880
 But it turns out to be related to a deep piece of math.

1:24:23.880 --> 1:24:26.800
 You see, for mathematicians,

1:24:26.800 --> 1:24:30.120
 manifolds of dimension bigger than four are simple.

1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:33.960
 Four dimension is the hardest dimension for math,

1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:35.800
 it turns out.

1:24:35.800 --> 1:24:38.680
 And it turns out the reason it's difficult is the following.

1:24:38.680 --> 1:24:41.200
 It turns out that in higher dimension,

1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:45.200
 you use what's called surgery in mathematical terminology,

1:24:45.200 --> 1:24:48.200
 where you use these two dimensional tubes

1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:50.440
 to maneuver them off of each other.

1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:53.160
 So you have two plus two becoming four.

1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:54.400
 In higher than four dimension,

1:24:54.400 --> 1:24:56.240
 you can pass them through each other

1:24:56.240 --> 1:24:57.920
 without them intersecting.

1:24:57.920 --> 1:25:00.440
 In four dimension, two plus two

1:25:01.440 --> 1:25:03.120
 doesn't allow you to pass them through each other.

1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:05.280
 So the same techniques that work in higher dimension

1:25:05.280 --> 1:25:08.280
 don't work in four dimension because two plus two is four.

1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:10.160
 The same reasoning I was just telling you

1:25:10.160 --> 1:25:12.760
 about strings finding each other in four

1:25:12.760 --> 1:25:16.120
 ends up to be the reason why four is much more complicated

1:25:16.120 --> 1:25:18.480
 to classify for mathematicians as well.

1:25:18.480 --> 1:25:20.280
 So there might be these things.

1:25:20.280 --> 1:25:22.840
 So I cannot say that this is the reason

1:25:22.840 --> 1:25:25.080
 that string theory is giving you three plus one,

1:25:25.080 --> 1:25:26.440
 but it could be a model for it.

1:25:26.440 --> 1:25:28.320
 And so there are these kinds of ideas

1:25:28.320 --> 1:25:31.440
 that could underlie why we have three extra dimensions

1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:32.840
 which are large and the rest of them are small.

1:25:32.840 --> 1:25:35.000
 But absolutely, we have to have a good reason.

1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:36.080
 We cannot leave it like that.

1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:38.320
 Can I ask a tricky human question?

1:25:38.320 --> 1:25:42.480
 So you are one of the seminal figures in string theory.

1:25:42.480 --> 1:25:44.000
 You got the Breakthrough Prize.

1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:45.840
 You've worked with Edward Witten.

1:25:45.840 --> 1:25:50.000
 There's no Nobel Prize that has been given on string theory.

1:25:51.400 --> 1:25:54.080
 Credit assignment is tricky in science.

1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:57.800
 It makes you quite sad, especially big, like LIGO,

1:25:57.800 --> 1:26:01.440
 big experimental projects when so many incredible people

1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:04.640
 have been involved and yet the Nobel Prize is annoying

1:26:04.640 --> 1:26:06.640
 in that it's only given to three people.

1:26:06.640 --> 1:26:08.760
 Who do you think gets the Nobel Prize

1:26:08.760 --> 1:26:12.280
 for string theory at first?

1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:17.280
 If it turns out that it, if not in full, then in part,

1:26:19.400 --> 1:26:24.400
 is a good model of the way the physics of the universe works.

1:26:24.920 --> 1:26:26.360
 Who are the key figures?

1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:28.680
 Maybe let's put Nobel Prize aside.

1:26:28.680 --> 1:26:29.520
 Who are the key figures?

1:26:29.520 --> 1:26:31.480
 Okay, I like the second version of the question.

1:26:31.480 --> 1:26:34.600
 Because I think to try to give a prize to one person

1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:37.120
 in string theory doesn't do justice to the diversity

1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:37.960
 of the subject.

1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:38.800
 That to me is.

1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:41.040
 So there was quite a lot of incredible people

1:26:41.040 --> 1:26:41.880
 in the history of string theory.

1:26:41.880 --> 1:26:43.200
 Quite a lot of people.

1:26:43.200 --> 1:26:44.520
 I mean, starting with Veneziano,

1:26:44.520 --> 1:26:46.120
 who wasn't talking about strings.

1:26:46.120 --> 1:26:48.440
 I mean, he wrote down the beginning of the strings.

1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:50.000
 We cannot ignore that for sure.

1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.440
 And so you start with that and you go on

1:26:52.440 --> 1:26:54.080
 with various other figures and so on.

1:26:54.080 --> 1:26:56.280
 So there are different epochs in string theory

1:26:56.280 --> 1:26:57.840
 and different people have been pushing it.

1:26:57.840 --> 1:26:59.760
 And so for example, the early epoch,

1:26:59.760 --> 1:27:02.640
 we just told you people like Veneziano,

1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:05.480
 and Nambu, and the Susskind, and others were pushing it.

1:27:05.480 --> 1:27:07.840
 Green and Schwarz were pushing it and so forth.

1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:09.640
 So this was, or Scherck and so on.

1:27:09.640 --> 1:27:13.040
 So these were the initial periods of pioneers,

1:27:13.040 --> 1:27:14.600
 I would say, of string theory.

1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:18.760
 And then there were the mid 80s that Edward Witten

1:27:18.760 --> 1:27:20.600
 was the major proponent of string theory.

1:27:20.600 --> 1:27:23.760
 And he really changed the landscape of string theory

1:27:23.760 --> 1:27:26.080
 in terms of what people do and how we view it.

1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:29.240
 And I think his efforts brought a lot of attention

1:27:29.240 --> 1:27:31.560
 to the community of string theory.

1:27:31.560 --> 1:27:34.640
 To the community about high energy community

1:27:34.640 --> 1:27:37.080
 to focus on this effort as the correct theory

1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:38.480
 of unification of forces.

1:27:38.480 --> 1:27:41.120
 So he brought a lot of research as well as, of course,

1:27:41.120 --> 1:27:44.440
 the first rate work he himself did to this area.

1:27:44.440 --> 1:27:45.960
 So that's in mid 80s and onwards,

1:27:45.960 --> 1:27:49.040
 and also in mid 90s where he was one of the proponents

1:27:49.040 --> 1:27:51.640
 of the duality revolution in string theory.

1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:54.240
 And with that came a lot of these other ideas

1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:58.400
 that led to breakthroughs involving, for example,

1:27:58.400 --> 1:28:00.920
 the example I told you about black holes and holography,

1:28:00.920 --> 1:28:03.880
 and the work that was later done by Maldacena

1:28:03.880 --> 1:28:06.600
 about the properties of duality between particle physics

1:28:06.600 --> 1:28:10.160
 and quantum gravity and the deeper connections

1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:12.920
 of holography, and it continues.

1:28:12.920 --> 1:28:15.320
 And there are many people within this range,

1:28:15.320 --> 1:28:16.600
 which I haven't even mentioned.

1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:19.000
 They have done fantastic important things.

1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:22.640
 How it gets recognized, I think, is secondary,

1:28:22.640 --> 1:28:25.480
 in my opinion, than the appreciation

1:28:25.480 --> 1:28:27.680
 that the effort is collective.

1:28:27.680 --> 1:28:30.400
 That, in fact, that to me is the more important part

1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:32.200
 of science that gets forgotten.

1:28:32.200 --> 1:28:35.160
 For some reason, humanity likes heroes,

1:28:35.160 --> 1:28:36.400
 and science is no exception.

1:28:36.400 --> 1:28:40.480
 We like heroes, but I personally try to avoid that trap.

1:28:40.480 --> 1:28:44.840
 I feel, in my work, most of my work is with colleagues.

1:28:44.840 --> 1:28:49.240
 I have much more collaborations than sole author papers,

1:28:49.240 --> 1:28:51.880
 and I enjoy it, and I think that that's, to me,

1:28:51.880 --> 1:28:54.320
 one of the most satisfying aspects of science

1:28:54.320 --> 1:28:59.240
 is to interact and learn and debate ideas with colleagues

1:28:59.240 --> 1:29:02.040
 because that influx of ideas enriches it,

1:29:02.040 --> 1:29:05.680
 and that's why I find it interesting.

1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:08.240
 To me, science, if I was on an island,

1:29:08.240 --> 1:29:10.360
 and if I was developing string theory by myself

1:29:10.360 --> 1:29:11.800
 and had nothing to do with anybody,

1:29:11.800 --> 1:29:14.120
 it would be much less satisfying, in my opinion.

1:29:14.120 --> 1:29:17.120
 Even if I could take credit I did it,

1:29:17.120 --> 1:29:18.320
 it won't be as satisfying.

1:29:18.320 --> 1:29:22.640
 Sitting alone with a big metal drinking champagne, no.

1:29:22.640 --> 1:29:25.720
 I think, to me, the collective work is more exciting,

1:29:25.720 --> 1:29:28.280
 and you mentioned my getting the breakthrough.

1:29:28.280 --> 1:29:30.480
 When I was getting it, I made sure to mention

1:29:30.480 --> 1:29:32.280
 that it is because of the joint work

1:29:32.280 --> 1:29:33.760
 that I've done with colleagues.

1:29:33.760 --> 1:29:36.800
 At that time, it was around 180 or so collaborators,

1:29:36.800 --> 1:29:39.720
 and I acknowledged them in the webpage for them.

1:29:39.720 --> 1:29:41.120
 I write all of their names

1:29:41.120 --> 1:29:42.640
 and the collaborations that led to this.

1:29:42.640 --> 1:29:46.520
 So, to me, science is fun when it's collaboration,

1:29:46.520 --> 1:29:48.720
 and yes, there are more important

1:29:48.720 --> 1:29:51.200
 and less important figures, as in any field,

1:29:51.200 --> 1:29:53.280
 and that's true, that's true in string theory as well,

1:29:53.280 --> 1:29:55.880
 but I think that I would like to view this

1:29:55.880 --> 1:29:56.920
 as a collective effort.

1:29:56.920 --> 1:30:00.480
 So, setting the heroes aside,

1:30:00.480 --> 1:30:04.200
 the Nobel Prize is a celebration of,

1:30:04.200 --> 1:30:05.720
 what's the right way to put it,

1:30:05.720 --> 1:30:08.200
 that this idea turned out to be right.

1:30:08.200 --> 1:30:11.560
 So, like, you look at Einstein

1:30:11.560 --> 1:30:13.720
 didn't believe in black holes,

1:30:13.720 --> 1:30:17.800
 and then black holes got their Nobel Prize.

1:30:17.800 --> 1:30:22.040
 Do you think string theory will get its Nobel Prize,

1:30:22.040 --> 1:30:25.400
 Nobel Prizes, if you were to bet money?

1:30:25.400 --> 1:30:27.800
 If this was an investment meeting

1:30:27.800 --> 1:30:29.960
 and we had to bet all our money,

1:30:29.960 --> 1:30:31.960
 do you think he gets the Nobel Prizes?

1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:34.520
 I think it's possible that none of the living physicists

1:30:34.520 --> 1:30:35.960
 will get the Nobel Prize in string theory,

1:30:35.960 --> 1:30:37.080
 but somebody will.

1:30:37.080 --> 1:30:41.560
 Because, unfortunately, the technology available today

1:30:41.560 --> 1:30:43.040
 is not very encouraging

1:30:43.040 --> 1:30:46.280
 in terms of seeing directly evidence for string theory.

1:30:46.280 --> 1:30:48.280
 Do you think it ultimately boils down to

1:30:48.280 --> 1:30:49.600
 the Nobel Prize will be given

1:30:49.600 --> 1:30:53.240
 when there is some direct or indirect evidence?

1:30:53.240 --> 1:30:55.960
 There would be, but I think that part of this

1:30:55.960 --> 1:30:58.760
 breakthrough prize was precisely the appreciation

1:30:58.760 --> 1:31:01.440
 that when we have sufficient evidence,

1:31:01.440 --> 1:31:04.160
 theoretical as it is, not experiment,

1:31:04.160 --> 1:31:06.200
 because of this technology lag,

1:31:06.200 --> 1:31:08.920
 you appreciate what you think is the correct path.

1:31:08.920 --> 1:31:12.520
 So, there are many people who have been recognized precisely

1:31:12.520 --> 1:31:14.000
 because they may not be around

1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:16.120
 when it actually gets experimented,

1:31:16.120 --> 1:31:17.840
 even though they discovered it.

1:31:17.840 --> 1:31:19.840
 So, there are many things like that

1:31:19.840 --> 1:31:21.480
 that's going on in science.

1:31:21.480 --> 1:31:25.600
 So, I think that I would want to attach less significance

1:31:25.600 --> 1:31:28.240
 to the recognitions of people.

1:31:28.240 --> 1:31:31.080
 And I have a second review on this,

1:31:31.080 --> 1:31:35.560
 which is there are people who look at these works

1:31:35.560 --> 1:31:37.480
 that people have done and put them together

1:31:37.480 --> 1:31:39.960
 and make the next big breakthrough.

1:31:39.960 --> 1:31:43.800
 And they get identified with, perhaps rightly,

1:31:43.800 --> 1:31:47.960
 with many of these new visions.

1:31:47.960 --> 1:31:51.360
 But they are on the shoulders of these little scientists.

1:31:51.360 --> 1:31:54.040
 Which don't get any recognition.

1:31:54.040 --> 1:31:55.480
 You know, yeah, you did this little work.

1:31:55.480 --> 1:31:56.920
 Oh yeah, you did this little work.

1:31:56.920 --> 1:31:57.760
 Oh yeah, yeah, five of you.

1:31:57.760 --> 1:31:59.280
 Oh yeah, these showed this pattern.

1:31:59.280 --> 1:32:01.800
 And then somebody else, it's not fair.

1:32:01.800 --> 1:32:05.720
 To me, those little guys, which kind of like,

1:32:05.720 --> 1:32:07.440
 like seem to do the little calculation here,

1:32:07.440 --> 1:32:10.120
 a little thing there, which doesn't rise to the occasion

1:32:10.120 --> 1:32:11.800
 of this grandiose kind of thing,

1:32:11.800 --> 1:32:15.120
 doesn't make it to the New York Times headlines and so on,

1:32:15.120 --> 1:32:17.080
 deserve a lot of recognition.

1:32:17.080 --> 1:32:18.400
 And I think they don't get enough.

1:32:18.400 --> 1:32:20.960
 I would say that there should be this Nobel prize

1:32:20.960 --> 1:32:23.920
 for, you know, they have these Doctors Without Borders,

1:32:23.920 --> 1:32:24.760
 they're a huge group.

1:32:24.760 --> 1:32:25.600
 They should do a similar thing.

1:32:25.600 --> 1:32:27.800
 And these String Theors Without Borders kind of,

1:32:27.800 --> 1:32:29.320
 everybody is doing a lot of work.

1:32:29.320 --> 1:32:32.880
 And I think that I would like to see that effort recognized.

1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:35.480
 I think in the long arc of history,

1:32:35.480 --> 1:32:38.080
 we're all little guys and girls

1:32:38.080 --> 1:32:40.640
 standing on the shoulders of each other.

1:32:40.640 --> 1:32:44.560
 I mean, it's all going to look tiny in retrospect.

1:32:44.560 --> 1:32:46.960
 If we celebrate, the New York Times,

1:32:46.960 --> 1:32:51.040
 you know, as a newspaper,

1:32:51.040 --> 1:32:55.000
 or the idea of a newspaper in a few centuries from now

1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:56.200
 will be long forgotten.

1:32:56.200 --> 1:32:57.680
 Yes, I agree with that.

1:32:57.680 --> 1:32:59.000
 Especially in the context of String Theory,

1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:00.840
 we should have a very long term view.

1:33:00.840 --> 1:33:01.960
 Yes, exactly.

1:33:01.960 --> 1:33:05.360
 Just as a tiny tangent, we mentioned Edward Witten.

1:33:05.360 --> 1:33:09.800
 And he, in a bunch of walks of life for me as an outsider,

1:33:09.800 --> 1:33:14.200
 comes up as a person who is widely considered as like

1:33:14.200 --> 1:33:17.920
 one of the most brilliant people in the history of physics,

1:33:17.920 --> 1:33:21.520
 just as a powerhouse of a human,

1:33:21.520 --> 1:33:26.520
 like the exceptional places that a human mind can rise to.

1:33:27.280 --> 1:33:28.120
 Yes.

1:33:28.120 --> 1:33:29.720
 You've gotten the chance to work with him.

1:33:29.720 --> 1:33:30.560
 What's he like?

1:33:30.560 --> 1:33:31.400
 Yes, more than that.

1:33:31.400 --> 1:33:34.240
 He was my advisor, PhD advisor.

1:33:34.240 --> 1:33:35.920
 So I got to know him very well

1:33:35.920 --> 1:33:37.480
 and I benefited from his insights.

1:33:37.480 --> 1:33:40.080
 In fact, what you said about him is accurate.

1:33:40.080 --> 1:33:42.280
 He is not only brilliant,

1:33:42.280 --> 1:33:46.560
 but he is also multifaceted in terms of the impact

1:33:46.560 --> 1:33:49.520
 he has had in not only physics, but also mathematics.

1:33:49.520 --> 1:33:50.880
 He has gotten the Fields Medal

1:33:50.880 --> 1:33:52.440
 because of his work in mathematics.

1:33:52.440 --> 1:33:57.440
 And rightly so, he has used his knowledge of physics

1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:01.640
 in a way which impacted deep ideas in modern mathematics.

1:34:01.640 --> 1:34:05.960
 And that's an example of the power of these ideas

1:34:05.960 --> 1:34:08.680
 in modern high energy physics and string theory,

1:34:08.680 --> 1:34:11.600
 the applicability of it to modern mathematics.

1:34:11.600 --> 1:34:16.360
 So he's quite an exceptional individual.

1:34:16.360 --> 1:34:19.560
 We don't come across such people a lot in history.

1:34:19.560 --> 1:34:20.680
 So I think, yes, indeed,

1:34:20.680 --> 1:34:24.120
 he's one of the rare figures in this history of subject.

1:34:24.120 --> 1:34:26.480
 He has had great impact on a lot of aspects

1:34:26.480 --> 1:34:27.320
 of not just string theory,

1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:29.360
 a lot of different areas in physics,

1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:32.720
 and also, yes, in mathematics as well.

1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:34.960
 So I think what you said about him is accurate.

1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:37.560
 I had the pleasure of interacting with him as a student

1:34:37.560 --> 1:34:40.680
 and later on as colleagues writing papers together

1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:41.520
 and so on.

1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:43.160
 What impact did he have on your life?

1:34:43.160 --> 1:34:46.040
 Like what have you learned from him?

1:34:46.040 --> 1:34:48.200
 If you were to look at the trajectory of your mind

1:34:48.200 --> 1:34:51.520
 of the way you approach science and physics and mathematics,

1:34:51.520 --> 1:34:54.360
 how did he perturb that trajectory in a way?

1:34:54.360 --> 1:34:55.600
 Yes, he did actually.

1:34:55.600 --> 1:34:57.680
 So I can explain because when I was a student,

1:34:57.680 --> 1:35:00.120
 I had the biggest impact by him,

1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:02.400
 clearly as a grad student at Princeton.

1:35:02.400 --> 1:35:06.640
 So I think that was a time where I was a little bit confused

1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:08.760
 about the relation between math and physics.

1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:11.280
 I got a double major in mathematics and physics

1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:14.600
 at MIT because I really enjoyed both.

1:35:14.600 --> 1:35:18.280
 And I liked the elegance and the rigor of mathematics.

1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:21.160
 And I liked the power of ideas in physics

1:35:21.160 --> 1:35:22.760
 and its applicability to reality

1:35:22.760 --> 1:35:26.360
 and what it teaches about the real world around us.

1:35:26.360 --> 1:35:30.200
 But I saw this tension between rigorous thinking

1:35:30.200 --> 1:35:33.440
 in mathematics and lack thereof in physics.

1:35:33.440 --> 1:35:36.240
 And this troubled me to no end.

1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:38.000
 I was troubled by that.

1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.680
 So I was at crossroads when I decided

1:35:40.680 --> 1:35:42.200
 to go to graduate school in physics

1:35:42.200 --> 1:35:44.800
 because I did not like some of the lack of rigors

1:35:44.800 --> 1:35:46.000
 I was seeing in physics.

1:35:47.120 --> 1:35:48.840
 On the other hand, to me, mathematics,

1:35:48.840 --> 1:35:49.920
 even though it was rigorous,

1:35:49.920 --> 1:35:53.040
 I didn't see the point of it.

1:35:53.040 --> 1:35:57.400
 In other words, the math theorem by itself could be beautiful

1:35:57.400 --> 1:35:58.760
 but I really wanted more than that.

1:35:58.760 --> 1:36:00.320
 I wanted to say, okay, what does it teach us

1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:02.880
 about something else, something more than just math?

1:36:02.880 --> 1:36:05.240
 So I wasn't that enamored with just math

1:36:05.240 --> 1:36:07.320
 but physics was a little bit bothersome.

1:36:07.320 --> 1:36:08.960
 Nevertheless, I decided to go to physics

1:36:08.960 --> 1:36:10.840
 and I decided to go to Princeton

1:36:10.840 --> 1:36:13.280
 and I started working with Edward Witten

1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:14.920
 as my thesis advisor.

1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:20.480
 And at that time I was trying to put physics

1:36:20.480 --> 1:36:22.400
 in rigorous mathematical terms.

1:36:22.400 --> 1:36:23.840
 I took quantum field theory.

1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:26.800
 I tried to make rigorous out of it and so on.

1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:29.080
 And no matter how hard I was trying,

1:36:29.080 --> 1:36:31.760
 I was not being able to do that.

1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:33.760
 And I was falling behind from my classes.

1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:35.640
 I was not learning much physics

1:36:35.640 --> 1:36:37.000
 and I was not making it rigorous.

1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:40.600
 And to me, it was this dichotomy between math and physics.

1:36:40.600 --> 1:36:41.440
 What am I doing?

1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:43.960
 I like math but this is not exactly this.

1:36:45.560 --> 1:36:47.480
 There comes Edward Witten as my advisor

1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:52.040
 and I see him in action thinking about math and physics.

1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:53.640
 He was amazing in math.

1:36:53.640 --> 1:36:54.880
 He knew all about the math.

1:36:54.880 --> 1:36:56.240
 It was no problem with him.

1:36:56.240 --> 1:36:58.560
 But he thought about physics in a way

1:36:58.560 --> 1:37:02.600
 which did not find this tension between the two.

1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:04.040
 It was much more harmonious.

1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:06.480
 For him, he would draw the Feynman diagrams

1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:08.880
 but he wouldn't view it as a formalism.

1:37:08.880 --> 1:37:10.560
 He was viewed, oh yeah, the particle goes over there

1:37:10.560 --> 1:37:11.480
 and this is what's going on.

1:37:11.480 --> 1:37:13.240
 And so wait, you're thinking really,

1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:15.760
 is this particle, this is really electron going there?

1:37:15.760 --> 1:37:16.600
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

1:37:16.600 --> 1:37:18.880
 It's not the form or the result perturbation.

1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:19.920
 No, no, no.

1:37:19.920 --> 1:37:21.160
 You just feel like the electron.

1:37:21.160 --> 1:37:23.040
 You're moving with this guy and do that and so on.

1:37:23.040 --> 1:37:24.880
 And you're thinking invariantly about physics

1:37:24.880 --> 1:37:27.760
 or the way he thought about relativity.

1:37:27.760 --> 1:37:29.840
 Like I was thinking about this momentum system.

1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:31.480
 He was thinking invariantly about physics,

1:37:31.480 --> 1:37:34.000
 just like the way you think about invariant concepts

1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:36.520
 and relativity, which don't depend on the frame of reference.

1:37:36.520 --> 1:37:39.840
 He was thinking about the physics in invariant ways,

1:37:39.840 --> 1:37:42.920
 the way that doesn't, that gives you a bigger perspective.

1:37:42.920 --> 1:37:46.480
 So this gradually helped me appreciate

1:37:46.480 --> 1:37:50.200
 that interconnections between ideas and physics

1:37:50.200 --> 1:37:52.760
 replaces mathematical rigor.

1:37:53.880 --> 1:37:56.360
 That the different facets reinforce each other.

1:37:56.360 --> 1:37:58.560
 They say, oh, I cannot rigorously define

1:37:58.560 --> 1:37:59.400
 what I mean by this,

1:37:59.400 --> 1:38:01.640
 but this thing connects with this other physics I've seen

1:38:01.640 --> 1:38:02.960
 and this other thing.

1:38:02.960 --> 1:38:06.360
 And they together form an elegant story.

1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:09.760
 And that replaced for me what I believed as a solidness,

1:38:09.760 --> 1:38:13.000
 which I found in math as a rigor, solid.

1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:16.160
 I found that replaced the rigor and solidness in physics.

1:38:16.160 --> 1:38:19.200
 So I found, okay, that's the way you can hang onto.

1:38:19.200 --> 1:38:20.320
 It is not wishy washy.

1:38:20.320 --> 1:38:23.200
 It's not like somebody is just not being able to prove it,

1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:24.720
 just making up a story.

1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:25.960
 It was more than that.

1:38:25.960 --> 1:38:28.480
 And it was no tension with mathematics.

1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:31.720
 In fact, mathematics was helping it, like friends.

1:38:31.720 --> 1:38:34.800
 And so much more harmonious and gives insights to physics.

1:38:34.800 --> 1:38:36.600
 So that's, I think, one of the main things I learned

1:38:36.600 --> 1:38:38.640
 from interactions with Witten.

1:38:38.640 --> 1:38:42.120
 And I think that now perhaps I have taken that

1:38:42.120 --> 1:38:43.440
 to a far extreme.

1:38:43.440 --> 1:38:45.080
 Maybe he wouldn't go this far as I have.

1:38:45.080 --> 1:38:48.560
 Namely, I use physics to define new mathematics

1:38:48.560 --> 1:38:50.920
 in a way which would be far less rigorous

1:38:50.920 --> 1:38:53.360
 than a physicist might necessarily believe,

1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:55.680
 because I take the physical intuition,

1:38:55.680 --> 1:38:58.880
 perhaps literally in many ways that could teach us about.

1:38:58.880 --> 1:39:01.120
 So now I've gained so much confidence

1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:03.680
 in physical intuition that I make bold statements

1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:08.400
 that sometimes takes math friends off guard.

1:39:08.400 --> 1:39:10.840
 So an example of it is mirror symmetry.

1:39:10.840 --> 1:39:14.360
 So we were studying these compactification

1:39:14.360 --> 1:39:15.760
 of string geometries.

1:39:15.760 --> 1:39:17.040
 This is after my PhD now.

1:39:17.040 --> 1:39:19.520
 I've, by the time I come to Harvard,

1:39:19.520 --> 1:39:21.640
 we're studying these aspects of string compactification

1:39:21.640 --> 1:39:23.440
 on these complicated manifolds,

1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:26.320
 six dimensional spaces called Kalabial manifolds,

1:39:26.320 --> 1:39:28.040
 very complicated.

1:39:28.040 --> 1:39:31.120
 And I noticed with a couple other colleagues

1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:35.200
 that there was a symmetry in physics suggested

1:39:35.200 --> 1:39:36.600
 between different Kalabials.

1:39:36.600 --> 1:39:40.360
 It suggested that you couldn't actually compute

1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:42.560
 the Euler characteristic of a Kalabia.

1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:45.520
 Euler characteristic is counting the number of points

1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:48.400
 minus the number of edges plus the number of faces minus.

1:39:48.400 --> 1:39:50.480
 So you can count the alternating sequence

1:39:50.480 --> 1:39:51.800
 of properties of a space,

1:39:51.800 --> 1:39:54.680
 which is a topological property of a space.

1:39:54.680 --> 1:39:56.680
 So Euler characteristics of the Kalabia

1:39:56.680 --> 1:39:57.880
 was a property of the space.

1:39:57.880 --> 1:40:01.560
 And so we noticed that from the physics formalism,

1:40:01.560 --> 1:40:03.520
 if string moves in a Kalabia,

1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:05.480
 you cannot distinguish,

1:40:05.480 --> 1:40:07.360
 we cannot compute the Euler characteristic.

1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:10.280
 You can only compute the absolute value of it.

1:40:10.280 --> 1:40:11.280
 Now this bothered us

1:40:11.280 --> 1:40:14.360
 because how could you not compute the actual sign

1:40:15.640 --> 1:40:17.440
 unless the both sides were the same?

1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:21.120
 So I conjectured maybe for every Kalabia

1:40:21.120 --> 1:40:22.320
 with Euler characteristics positive,

1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:23.600
 there's one with negative.

1:40:23.600 --> 1:40:25.240
 I told this to my colleague Yao

1:40:25.240 --> 1:40:28.480
 who's namesake is Kalabia,

1:40:30.680 --> 1:40:31.880
 that I'm making this conjecture.

1:40:31.880 --> 1:40:33.600
 Is it possible that for every Kalabia,

1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:36.560
 there's one with the opposite Euler characteristic?

1:40:36.560 --> 1:40:37.840
 Sounds not reasonable.

1:40:37.840 --> 1:40:38.680
 I said, why?

1:40:38.680 --> 1:40:40.320
 He said, well, we know more Kalabias

1:40:40.320 --> 1:40:42.720
 with negative Euler characteristics than positive.

1:40:44.520 --> 1:40:46.520
 I said, but physics says we cannot distinguish them.

1:40:46.520 --> 1:40:47.840
 At least I don't see how.

1:40:47.840 --> 1:40:50.440
 So we conjectured that for every Kalabia

1:40:50.440 --> 1:40:51.720
 with one sign, there's the other one,

1:40:51.720 --> 1:40:54.080
 despite the mathematical evidence,

1:40:54.080 --> 1:40:55.680
 despite the mathematical evidence,

1:40:55.680 --> 1:40:58.480
 despite the expert telling us it's not the right idea.

1:40:59.320 --> 1:41:02.040
 If a few years later, this symmetry, mirror symmetry

1:41:02.040 --> 1:41:04.520
 between the sign with the opposite sign

1:41:04.520 --> 1:41:06.960
 was later confirmed by mathematicians.

1:41:06.960 --> 1:41:09.160
 So this is actually the opposite view.

1:41:09.160 --> 1:41:11.560
 That is physics is so sure about it

1:41:11.560 --> 1:41:13.720
 that you're going against the mathematical wisdom,

1:41:13.720 --> 1:41:15.400
 telling them they better look for it.

1:41:15.400 --> 1:41:19.360
 So taking the physical intuition literally

1:41:19.360 --> 1:41:22.120
 and then having that drive the mathematics.

1:41:22.120 --> 1:41:22.960
 Exactly.

1:41:22.960 --> 1:41:26.160
 And now we are so confident about many such examples

1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:30.320
 that has affected modern mathematics in ways like this,

1:41:30.320 --> 1:41:31.600
 that we are much more confident

1:41:31.600 --> 1:41:33.920
 about our understanding of what string theory is.

1:41:33.920 --> 1:41:35.080
 These are another aspects,

1:41:35.080 --> 1:41:37.600
 other aspects of why we feel string theory is correct.

1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:39.880
 It's doing these kinds of things.

1:41:39.880 --> 1:41:41.640
 I've been hearing your talk quite a bit

1:41:41.640 --> 1:41:46.000
 about string theory, landscape and the swamp land.

1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:47.840
 What the heck are those two concepts?

1:41:47.840 --> 1:41:48.840
 Okay, very good question.

1:41:48.840 --> 1:41:51.920
 So let's go back to what I was describing about Feynman.

1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:55.800
 Feynman was trying to do these diagrams for graviton

1:41:55.800 --> 1:41:57.320
 and electrons and all that.

1:41:57.320 --> 1:42:00.120
 He found that he's getting infinities he cannot resolve.

1:42:01.240 --> 1:42:04.080
 Okay, the natural conclusion is that field theories

1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:06.600
 and gravity and quantum theory don't go together

1:42:06.600 --> 1:42:07.760
 and you cannot have it.

1:42:08.640 --> 1:42:11.320
 So in other words, field theories and gravity

1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:14.240
 are inconsistent with quantum mechanics, period.

1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:18.400
 String theory came up with examples

1:42:18.400 --> 1:42:20.800
 but didn't address the question more broadly

1:42:20.800 --> 1:42:23.120
 that is it true that every field theory

1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:25.880
 can be coupled to gravity in a quantum mechanical way?

1:42:27.400 --> 1:42:30.640
 It turns out that Feynman was essentially right.

1:42:30.640 --> 1:42:33.200
 Almost all particle physics theories,

1:42:33.200 --> 1:42:35.520
 no matter what you add to it,

1:42:35.520 --> 1:42:38.320
 when you put gravity in it, doesn't work.

1:42:38.320 --> 1:42:40.440
 Only rare exceptions work.

1:42:41.440 --> 1:42:44.160
 So string theory are those rare exceptions.

1:42:44.160 --> 1:42:46.040
 So therefore the general principle

1:42:46.040 --> 1:42:47.800
 that Feynman found was correct.

1:42:47.800 --> 1:42:50.320
 Quantum field theory and gravity and quantum mechanics

1:42:50.320 --> 1:42:54.760
 don't go together except for Joule's exceptional cases.

1:42:54.760 --> 1:42:56.400
 There are exceptional cases.

1:42:56.400 --> 1:43:00.200
 Okay, the total vastness of quantum field theories

1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:04.320
 that are there we call the set of quantum field theories,

1:43:04.320 --> 1:43:05.320
 possible things.

1:43:05.320 --> 1:43:08.300
 Which ones can be consistently coupled to gravity?

1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:13.160
 We call that subspace the landscape.

1:43:13.160 --> 1:43:16.200
 The rest of them we call the swampland.

1:43:16.200 --> 1:43:18.040
 It doesn't mean they are bad quantum field theories,

1:43:18.040 --> 1:43:19.960
 they are perfectly fine.

1:43:19.960 --> 1:43:21.880
 But when you couple them to gravity,

1:43:21.880 --> 1:43:24.200
 they don't make sense, unfortunately.

1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:27.160
 And it turns out that the ratio of them,

1:43:27.160 --> 1:43:29.720
 the number of theories which are consistent with gravity

1:43:29.720 --> 1:43:31.320
 to the ones without,

1:43:31.320 --> 1:43:33.960
 the ratio of the area of the landscape

1:43:33.960 --> 1:43:36.800
 to the swampland, in other words, is measure zero.

1:43:37.880 --> 1:43:40.240
 So the swampland's infinitely large?

1:43:40.240 --> 1:43:41.640
 The swampland's infinitely large.

1:43:41.640 --> 1:43:43.200
 So let me give you one example.

1:43:43.200 --> 1:43:46.480
 Take a theory in four dimension with matter

1:43:46.480 --> 1:43:48.880
 with maximum amount of supersymmetry.

1:43:48.880 --> 1:43:51.680
 Can you get, it turns out a theory in four dimension

1:43:51.680 --> 1:43:53.800
 with maximum amount of supersymmetry

1:43:53.800 --> 1:43:56.660
 is characterized just with one thing, a group.

1:43:56.660 --> 1:43:58.360
 What we call the gauge group.

1:43:58.360 --> 1:44:01.500
 Once you pick a group, you have to find the theory.

1:44:01.500 --> 1:44:04.120
 Okay, so does every group make sense?

1:44:04.120 --> 1:44:05.280
 Yeah.

1:44:05.280 --> 1:44:07.460
 As far as quantum field theory, every group makes sense.

1:44:07.460 --> 1:44:08.560
 There are infinitely many groups,

1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:10.680
 there are infinitely many quantum field theories.

1:44:10.680 --> 1:44:13.760
 But it turns out there are only finite number of them

1:44:13.760 --> 1:44:16.840
 which are consistent with gravity out of that same list.

1:44:16.840 --> 1:44:19.420
 So you can take any group but only finite number of them,

1:44:19.420 --> 1:44:22.680
 the ones who's, what we call the rank of the group,

1:44:22.680 --> 1:44:26.200
 the ones whose rank is less than 23.

1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:29.720
 Any one bigger than rank 23 belongs to the swampland.

1:44:29.720 --> 1:44:31.200
 There are infinitely many of them.

1:44:31.200 --> 1:44:33.100
 They're beautiful field theories,

1:44:33.100 --> 1:44:35.600
 but not when you include gravity.

1:44:35.600 --> 1:44:37.760
 So then this becomes a hopeful thing.

1:44:37.760 --> 1:44:41.920
 So in other words, in our universe, we have gravity.

1:44:41.920 --> 1:44:44.660
 Therefore, we are part of that jewel subset.

1:44:44.660 --> 1:44:49.480
 Now, is this jewel subset small or large?

1:44:49.480 --> 1:44:50.320
 Yeah.

1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:54.480
 It turns out that subset is humongous,

1:44:54.480 --> 1:44:56.260
 but we believe still finite.

1:44:57.400 --> 1:44:59.400
 The set of possibilities is infinite,

1:44:59.400 --> 1:45:02.280
 but the set of consistent ones,

1:45:02.280 --> 1:45:04.280
 I mean, the set of quantum field theories are infinite,

1:45:04.280 --> 1:45:07.140
 but the consistent ones are finite, but humongous.

1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.080
 The fact that they're humongous

1:45:10.080 --> 1:45:12.280
 is the problem we are facing in string theory,

1:45:12.280 --> 1:45:16.560
 because we do not know which one of these possibilities

1:45:16.560 --> 1:45:18.160
 the universe we live in.

1:45:18.160 --> 1:45:20.380
 If we knew, we could make more specific predictions

1:45:20.380 --> 1:45:21.400
 about our universe.

1:45:21.400 --> 1:45:22.360
 We don't know.

1:45:22.360 --> 1:45:24.520
 And that is one of the challenges when string theory,

1:45:24.520 --> 1:45:26.040
 which point on the landscape,

1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:28.660
 which corner of this landscape do we live in?

1:45:28.660 --> 1:45:30.120
 We don't know.

1:45:30.120 --> 1:45:31.780
 So what do we do?

1:45:31.780 --> 1:45:35.680
 Well, there are principles that are beginning to emerge.

1:45:35.680 --> 1:45:38.040
 So I will give you one example of it.

1:45:38.040 --> 1:45:40.720
 You look at the patterns of what you're getting

1:45:40.720 --> 1:45:41.940
 in terms of these good ones,

1:45:41.940 --> 1:45:43.400
 the ones which are in the landscape

1:45:43.400 --> 1:45:45.540
 compared to the ones which are not.

1:45:45.540 --> 1:45:46.620
 You find certain patterns.

1:45:46.620 --> 1:45:47.920
 I'll give you one pattern.

1:45:49.280 --> 1:45:52.700
 You find in all the ones that you get from string theory,

1:45:52.700 --> 1:45:55.560
 gravitational force is always there,

1:45:55.560 --> 1:45:58.620
 but it's always, always the weakest force.

1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:03.800
 However, you could easily imagine field theories

1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:05.720
 for which gravity is not the weakest force.

1:46:05.720 --> 1:46:08.960
 For example, take our universe.

1:46:08.960 --> 1:46:10.680
 If you take mass of the electron,

1:46:10.680 --> 1:46:14.080
 if you increase the mass of electron by a huge factor,

1:46:14.080 --> 1:46:16.060
 the gravitational attraction of the electrons

1:46:16.060 --> 1:46:17.840
 will be bigger than the electric repulsion

1:46:17.840 --> 1:46:19.440
 between two electrons.

1:46:19.440 --> 1:46:20.920
 And the gravity will be stronger.

1:46:20.920 --> 1:46:21.740
 That's all.

1:46:22.780 --> 1:46:25.060
 It happens that it's not the case in our universe

1:46:25.060 --> 1:46:28.620
 because electron is very tiny in mass compared to that.

1:46:28.620 --> 1:46:31.920
 Just like our universe, gravity is the weakest force.

1:46:31.920 --> 1:46:33.840
 We find in all these other ones,

1:46:33.840 --> 1:46:36.180
 which are part of the good ones,

1:46:36.180 --> 1:46:37.960
 the gravity is the weakest force.

1:46:37.960 --> 1:46:40.720
 This is called the weak gravity conjecture.

1:46:40.720 --> 1:46:43.660
 We conjecture that all the points in the landscape

1:46:43.660 --> 1:46:44.760
 have this property.

1:46:45.920 --> 1:46:47.680
 Our universe being just an example of it.

1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:49.520
 So there are these qualitative features

1:46:49.520 --> 1:46:50.920
 that we are beginning to see.

1:46:50.920 --> 1:46:52.320
 But how do we argue for this?

1:46:52.320 --> 1:46:53.960
 Just by looking patterns?

1:46:53.960 --> 1:46:55.760
 Just by looking string theory as this?

1:46:55.760 --> 1:46:56.960
 No, that's not enough.

1:46:58.080 --> 1:47:00.320
 We need more reason, more better reasoning.

1:47:00.320 --> 1:47:01.840
 And it turns out there is.

1:47:01.840 --> 1:47:05.040
 The reasoning for this turns out to be studying black holes.

1:47:05.040 --> 1:47:09.500
 Ideas of black holes turn out to put certain restrictions

1:47:09.500 --> 1:47:12.040
 of what a good quantum filter should be.

1:47:12.040 --> 1:47:14.480
 It turns out using black hole,

1:47:14.480 --> 1:47:16.620
 the fact that the black holes evaporate,

1:47:17.700 --> 1:47:20.120
 the fact that the black holes evaporate

1:47:20.120 --> 1:47:23.560
 gives you a way to check the relation

1:47:23.560 --> 1:47:25.880
 between the mass and the charge of elementary particle.

1:47:25.880 --> 1:47:28.480
 Because what you can do, you can take a charged particle

1:47:28.480 --> 1:47:30.520
 and throw it into a charged black hole

1:47:30.520 --> 1:47:32.040
 and wait it to evaporate.

1:47:32.040 --> 1:47:34.440
 And by looking at the properties of evaporation,

1:47:34.440 --> 1:47:37.800
 you find that if it cannot evaporate particles

1:47:37.800 --> 1:47:39.500
 whose mass is less than their charge,

1:47:39.500 --> 1:47:40.800
 then it will never evaporate.

1:47:40.800 --> 1:47:42.120
 You will be stuck.

1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:44.520
 And so the possibility of a black hole evaporation

1:47:44.520 --> 1:47:47.180
 forces you to have particles whose mass

1:47:47.180 --> 1:47:50.480
 is sufficiently small so that the gravity is weaker.

1:47:50.480 --> 1:47:52.920
 So you connect this fact to the other fact.

1:47:52.920 --> 1:47:55.040
 So we begin to find different facts

1:47:55.040 --> 1:47:56.320
 that reinforce each other.

1:47:56.320 --> 1:47:59.360
 So different parts of the physics reinforce each other.

1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:02.360
 And once they all kind of come together,

1:48:02.360 --> 1:48:04.240
 you believe that you're getting the principle correct.

1:48:04.240 --> 1:48:05.560
 So weak gravity conjecture

1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:07.480
 is one of the principles we believe in

1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:09.760
 as a necessity of these conditions.

1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:12.280
 So these are the predictions string theory are making.

1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:13.120
 Is that enough?

1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:14.680
 Well, it's qualitative.

1:48:14.680 --> 1:48:16.200
 It's a semi quantity.

1:48:16.200 --> 1:48:17.600
 It's just the mass of the electron

1:48:17.600 --> 1:48:19.560
 should be less than some number.

1:48:19.560 --> 1:48:23.040
 But that number is, if I call that number one,

1:48:23.040 --> 1:48:23.880
 the mass of the electron

1:48:23.880 --> 1:48:25.640
 turns out to be 10 to the minus 20 actually.

1:48:25.640 --> 1:48:26.800
 So it's much less than one.

1:48:26.800 --> 1:48:28.000
 It's not one.

1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:30.240
 But on the other hand,

1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:32.760
 there's a similar reasoning for a big black hole

1:48:32.760 --> 1:48:34.020
 in our universe.

1:48:34.020 --> 1:48:36.460
 And if that evaporation should take place,

1:48:36.460 --> 1:48:37.520
 gives you another restriction,

1:48:37.520 --> 1:48:39.300
 tells you the mass of the electron

1:48:39.300 --> 1:48:41.320
 is bigger than 10 to the,

1:48:41.320 --> 1:48:43.240
 now in this case, bigger than something.

1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:45.760
 It shows bigger than 10 to the minus 30 in the Planck unit.

1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:47.420
 So you find, huh,

1:48:47.420 --> 1:48:49.400
 the mass of the electron should be less than one,

1:48:49.400 --> 1:48:51.320
 but bigger than 10 to the minus 30.

1:48:51.320 --> 1:48:52.160
 In our universe,

1:48:52.160 --> 1:48:54.440
 the mass of the electron is 10 to the minus 20.

1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:57.040
 Okay, now this kind of you could call postiction,

1:48:57.040 --> 1:48:59.140
 but I would say it follows from principles

1:48:59.140 --> 1:49:01.920
 that we now understand from string theory, first principle.

1:49:01.920 --> 1:49:04.400
 So we are making, beginning to make

1:49:04.400 --> 1:49:05.840
 these kinds of predictions,

1:49:05.840 --> 1:49:09.900
 which are very much connected to aspects of particle physics

1:49:09.900 --> 1:49:12.260
 that we didn't think are related to gravity.

1:49:12.260 --> 1:49:14.960
 We thought, just take any electron mass you want.

1:49:14.960 --> 1:49:15.800
 What's the problem?

1:49:15.800 --> 1:49:17.380
 It has a problem with gravity.

1:49:17.380 --> 1:49:18.880
 And so that conjecture

1:49:20.040 --> 1:49:22.480
 has also a happy consequence

1:49:22.480 --> 1:49:24.700
 that it explains that our universe,

1:49:24.700 --> 1:49:28.640
 like why the heck is gravity so weak as a force

1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:32.360
 and that's not only an accident, but almost a necessity

1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:35.360
 if these forces are to coexist effectively?

1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:38.280
 Exactly, so that's the reinforcement

1:49:38.280 --> 1:49:40.760
 of what we know in our universe,

1:49:40.760 --> 1:49:43.300
 but we are finding that as a general principle.

1:49:43.300 --> 1:49:46.400
 So we want to know what aspects of our universe

1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:47.920
 is forced on us,

1:49:47.920 --> 1:49:50.740
 like the weak gravity conjecture and other aspects.

1:49:50.740 --> 1:49:52.760
 How much of them do we understand?

1:49:52.760 --> 1:49:54.800
 Can we have particles lighter than neutrinos?

1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:56.380
 Or maybe that's not possible.

1:49:56.380 --> 1:49:57.440
 You see the neutrino mass,

1:49:57.440 --> 1:49:59.600
 it turns out to be related to dark energy

1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:01.640
 in a mysterious way.

1:50:01.640 --> 1:50:04.400
 Naively, there's no relation between dark energy

1:50:04.400 --> 1:50:06.520
 and the mass of a particle.

1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:07.560
 We have found arguments

1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:10.040
 from within the swampland kind of ideas,

1:50:10.040 --> 1:50:12.640
 why it has to be related.

1:50:12.640 --> 1:50:15.280
 And so there are beginning to be these connections

1:50:15.280 --> 1:50:17.920
 between graph consistency of quantum gravity

1:50:17.920 --> 1:50:22.300
 and aspects of our universe gradually being sharpened.

1:50:22.300 --> 1:50:25.200
 But we are still far from a precise quantitative prediction

1:50:25.200 --> 1:50:27.880
 like we have to have such and such, but that's the hope,

1:50:27.880 --> 1:50:29.520
 that we are going in that direction.

1:50:29.520 --> 1:50:31.000
 Coming up with the theory of everything

1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:34.200
 that unifies general relativity and quantum field theory

1:50:34.200 --> 1:50:39.200
 is one of the big dreams of human civilization.

1:50:39.880 --> 1:50:43.400
 Us descendants of apes wondering about how this world works.

1:50:43.400 --> 1:50:44.840
 So a lot of people dream.

1:50:46.100 --> 1:50:50.920
 What are your thoughts about sort of other out there ideas,

1:50:50.920 --> 1:50:55.920
 theories of everything or unifying theories?

1:50:56.120 --> 1:50:58.440
 So there's a quantum loop gravity.

1:50:59.920 --> 1:51:03.160
 There's also more sort of like a friend of mine,

1:51:03.160 --> 1:51:05.600
 Eric Weinstein beginning to propose

1:51:05.600 --> 1:51:07.600
 something called geometric unity.

1:51:07.600 --> 1:51:09.080
 So these kinds of attempts,

1:51:09.080 --> 1:51:10.800
 whether it's through mathematical physics

1:51:10.800 --> 1:51:12.520
 or through other avenues,

1:51:12.520 --> 1:51:13.800
 or with Stephen Wolfram,

1:51:13.800 --> 1:51:16.160
 a more computational view of the universe.

1:51:16.160 --> 1:51:18.820
 Again, in his case, it's these hyper graphs

1:51:18.820 --> 1:51:21.520
 that are very tiny objects as well.

1:51:21.520 --> 1:51:23.680
 Similarly, a string theory

1:51:23.680 --> 1:51:25.800
 and trying to grapple with this world.

1:51:25.800 --> 1:51:26.880
 What do you think?

1:51:26.880 --> 1:51:30.200
 Is there any of these theories that are compelling to you,

1:51:30.200 --> 1:51:33.520
 that are interesting that may turn out to be true

1:51:33.520 --> 1:51:36.240
 or at least may turn out to contain ideas that are useful?

1:51:36.240 --> 1:51:37.320
 Yes, I think the latter.

1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:40.760
 I would say that the containing ideas that are true

1:51:40.760 --> 1:51:43.600
 is my opinion was what some of these ideas might be.

1:51:43.600 --> 1:51:45.720
 For example, loop quantum gravity

1:51:45.720 --> 1:51:47.920
 is to me not a complete theory of gravity in any sense,

1:51:47.920 --> 1:51:50.320
 but they have some nuggets of truth in them.

1:51:50.320 --> 1:51:53.000
 And typically what I expect to happen,

1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:55.720
 and I have seen examples of this within string theory,

1:51:55.720 --> 1:51:57.960
 aspects which we didn't think are part of string theory

1:51:57.960 --> 1:51:58.840
 come to be part of it.

1:51:58.840 --> 1:52:00.840
 For example, I'll give you one example.

1:52:00.840 --> 1:52:03.320
 String was believed to be 10 dimensional.

1:52:03.320 --> 1:52:05.960
 And then there was this 11 dimensional super gravity.

1:52:05.960 --> 1:52:08.120
 Nobody know what the heck is that?

1:52:08.120 --> 1:52:10.040
 Why are we getting 11 dimensional super gravity

1:52:10.040 --> 1:52:11.720
 whereas string is saying it should be 10 dimensional?

1:52:11.720 --> 1:52:14.880
 11 was the maximum dimension you can have a super gravity,

1:52:14.880 --> 1:52:17.980
 but string was saying, sorry, we're 10 dimensional.

1:52:17.980 --> 1:52:20.520
 So for a while we thought that theory is wrong

1:52:20.520 --> 1:52:21.420
 because how could it be?

1:52:21.420 --> 1:52:23.380
 Because string theory is definitely a theory of everything.

1:52:23.380 --> 1:52:25.440
 We later learned that one of the circles

1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:27.520
 of string theory itself was tiny,

1:52:28.520 --> 1:52:30.200
 that we had not appreciated that fact.

1:52:30.200 --> 1:52:32.200
 And we discovered by doing thought experiments

1:52:32.200 --> 1:52:35.000
 of string theory that there's gotta be an extra circle

1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:36.420
 and that circle is connected

1:52:36.420 --> 1:52:38.360
 to an 11 dimensional perspective.

1:52:38.360 --> 1:52:40.720
 And that's what later on got called M theory.

1:52:40.720 --> 1:52:43.240
 So there are these kinds of things

1:52:43.240 --> 1:52:45.880
 that we do not know what exactly string theory is.

1:52:45.880 --> 1:52:47.380
 We're still learning.

1:52:47.380 --> 1:52:50.520
 So we do not have a final formulation of string theory.

1:52:50.520 --> 1:52:52.380
 It's very well could be the different facets

1:52:52.380 --> 1:52:53.940
 of different ideas come together

1:52:53.940 --> 1:52:55.320
 like loop quantum gravity or whatnot,

1:52:55.320 --> 1:52:56.840
 but I wouldn't put them on par.

1:52:56.840 --> 1:53:01.080
 Namely, loop quantum gravity is a scatter of ideas

1:53:01.080 --> 1:53:03.800
 about what happens to space when they get very tiny.

1:53:03.800 --> 1:53:06.480
 For example, you replace things by discrete data

1:53:06.480 --> 1:53:08.720
 and try to quantize it and so on.

1:53:08.720 --> 1:53:13.560
 And it sounds like a natural idea to quantize space.

1:53:13.560 --> 1:53:15.200
 If you were naively trying to do quantum space,

1:53:15.200 --> 1:53:17.280
 you might think about trying to take points

1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:20.160
 and put them together in some discrete fashion

1:53:20.160 --> 1:53:23.000
 in some way that is reminiscent of loop quantum gravity.

1:53:24.760 --> 1:53:27.000
 String theory is more subtle than that.

1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:29.140
 For example, I will just give you an example.

1:53:29.140 --> 1:53:31.200
 And this is the kind of thing that we didn't put in by hand,

1:53:31.200 --> 1:53:32.440
 we got it out.

1:53:32.440 --> 1:53:33.840
 And so it's more subtle than,

1:53:33.840 --> 1:53:35.840
 so what happens if you squeeze the space

1:53:35.840 --> 1:53:37.780
 to be smaller and smaller?

1:53:37.780 --> 1:53:41.040
 Well, you think that after a certain distance,

1:53:41.040 --> 1:53:43.800
 the notion of distance should break down.

1:53:43.800 --> 1:53:47.680
 You know, when you go smaller than Planck scale,

1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:48.700
 should break down.

1:53:48.700 --> 1:53:50.640
 What happens in string theory?

1:53:50.640 --> 1:53:52.160
 We do not know the full answer to that,

1:53:52.160 --> 1:53:53.120
 but we know the following.

1:53:53.120 --> 1:53:55.120
 Namely, if you take a space

1:53:55.120 --> 1:53:56.560
 and bring it smaller and smaller,

1:53:56.560 --> 1:53:58.560
 if the box gets smaller than the Planck scale

1:53:58.560 --> 1:54:00.500
 by a factor of 10,

1:54:00.500 --> 1:54:04.000
 it is equivalent by the duality transformation

1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:05.760
 to a space which is 10 times bigger.

1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:10.080
 So there's a symmetry called T duality,

1:54:10.080 --> 1:54:12.480
 which takes L to one over L.

1:54:12.480 --> 1:54:14.420
 Well, L is measured in Planck units,

1:54:14.420 --> 1:54:16.280
 or more precisely string units.

1:54:16.280 --> 1:54:20.520
 This inversion is a very subtle effect.

1:54:20.520 --> 1:54:21.680
 And I would not have been,

1:54:21.680 --> 1:54:23.760
 or any physicist would not have been able to design a theory

1:54:23.760 --> 1:54:25.060
 which has this property,

1:54:25.060 --> 1:54:27.160
 that when you make the space smaller,

1:54:27.160 --> 1:54:29.440
 it is as if you're making it bigger.

1:54:29.440 --> 1:54:32.480
 That means there is no experiment you can do

1:54:32.480 --> 1:54:34.860
 to distinguish the size of the space.

1:54:34.860 --> 1:54:35.740
 This is remarkable.

1:54:35.740 --> 1:54:37.800
 For example, Einstein would have said,

1:54:37.800 --> 1:54:39.400
 of course I can't measure the size of the space.

1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:40.240
 What do I do?

1:54:40.240 --> 1:54:41.400
 Well, I take a flashlight,

1:54:41.400 --> 1:54:43.020
 I send the light around,

1:54:43.020 --> 1:54:44.340
 measure how long it takes for the light

1:54:44.340 --> 1:54:45.320
 to go around the space,

1:54:45.320 --> 1:54:47.040
 and bring back and find the radius

1:54:47.040 --> 1:54:48.800
 or circumference of the universe.

1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:49.700
 What's the problem?

1:54:50.880 --> 1:54:52.120
 I said, well, suppose you do that,

1:54:52.120 --> 1:54:52.960
 and you shrink it.

1:54:52.960 --> 1:54:54.000
 He said, well, it gets smaller and smaller.

1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:54.840
 So what?

1:54:54.840 --> 1:54:56.840
 I said, well, it turns out in string theory,

1:54:56.840 --> 1:54:59.320
 there are two different kinds of photons.

1:55:00.480 --> 1:55:02.360
 One photon measures one over L,

1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:03.560
 the other one measures L.

1:55:03.560 --> 1:55:07.520
 And so this duality reformulates.

1:55:07.520 --> 1:55:08.840
 And when the space gets smaller,

1:55:08.840 --> 1:55:10.720
 it says, oh no, you better use the bigger perspective

1:55:10.720 --> 1:55:13.020
 because the smaller one is harder to deal with.

1:55:13.020 --> 1:55:13.860
 So you do this one.

1:55:13.860 --> 1:55:16.160
 So these examples of loop quantum gravity

1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:17.240
 have none of these features.

1:55:17.240 --> 1:55:18.640
 These features that I'm telling you about,

1:55:18.640 --> 1:55:20.200
 we have learned from string theory.

1:55:20.200 --> 1:55:22.040
 But they nevertheless have some of these ideas

1:55:22.040 --> 1:55:24.500
 like topological gravity aspects

1:55:24.500 --> 1:55:28.040
 are emphasized in the context of loop quantum gravity

1:55:28.040 --> 1:55:28.860
 in some form.

1:55:28.860 --> 1:55:31.280
 And so these ideas might be there in some kernel,

1:55:31.280 --> 1:55:32.400
 in some corners of string theory.

1:55:32.400 --> 1:55:35.360
 In fact, I wrote a paper about topological string theory

1:55:35.360 --> 1:55:38.240
 and some connections with potentially loop quantum gravity,

1:55:38.240 --> 1:55:39.240
 which could be part of that.

1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:41.640
 So there are little facets of connections.

1:55:41.640 --> 1:55:43.840
 I wouldn't say they're complete,

1:55:43.840 --> 1:55:46.120
 but I would say most probably what will happen

1:55:46.120 --> 1:55:48.480
 to some of these ideas, the good ones at least,

1:55:48.480 --> 1:55:50.720
 they will be absorbed to string theory,

1:55:50.720 --> 1:55:51.840
 if they are correct.

1:55:51.840 --> 1:55:54.360
 Let me ask a crazy out there question.

1:55:54.360 --> 1:55:59.360
 Can physics help us understand life?

1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:04.360
 So we spoke so confidently about the laws of physics

1:56:06.180 --> 1:56:07.700
 being able to explain reality.

1:56:07.700 --> 1:56:11.900
 But, and we even said words like theory of everything,

1:56:11.900 --> 1:56:13.620
 implying that the word everything

1:56:13.620 --> 1:56:15.820
 is actually describing everything.

1:56:15.820 --> 1:56:20.540
 Is it possible that the four laws we've been talking about

1:56:20.540 --> 1:56:22.080
 are actually missing,

1:56:22.080 --> 1:56:24.840
 they are accurate in describing what they're describing,

1:56:24.840 --> 1:56:26.260
 but they're missing the description

1:56:26.260 --> 1:56:27.900
 of a lot of other things,

1:56:27.900 --> 1:56:30.540
 like emergence of life

1:56:31.700 --> 1:56:35.100
 and emergence of perhaps consciousness.

1:56:35.100 --> 1:56:39.280
 So is there, do you ever think about this kind of stuff

1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:44.280
 where we would need to understand extra physics

1:56:44.480 --> 1:56:49.480
 to try to explain the emergence of these complex pockets

1:56:51.160 --> 1:56:54.280
 of interesting weird stuff that we call life

1:56:54.280 --> 1:56:58.140
 and consciousness in this big homogeneous universe

1:56:58.140 --> 1:57:00.420
 that's mostly boring and nothing is happening yet?

1:57:00.420 --> 1:57:03.580
 So first of all, we don't claim that string theory

1:57:03.580 --> 1:57:05.780
 is the theory of everything in the sense that

1:57:05.780 --> 1:57:07.700
 we know enough what this theory is.

1:57:07.700 --> 1:57:09.260
 We don't know enough about string theory itself,

1:57:09.260 --> 1:57:10.100
 we are learning it.

1:57:10.100 --> 1:57:12.020
 So I wouldn't say, okay, give me whatever,

1:57:12.020 --> 1:57:14.400
 I will tell you how it works, no.

1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:16.500
 However, I would say by definition,

1:57:16.500 --> 1:57:19.420
 by definition to me physics is checking all reality.

1:57:20.720 --> 1:57:22.580
 Any form of reality, I call it physics,

1:57:22.580 --> 1:57:23.420
 that's my definition.

1:57:23.420 --> 1:57:25.580
 I mean, I may not know a lot of it,

1:57:25.580 --> 1:57:27.860
 like maybe the origin of life and so on,

1:57:27.860 --> 1:57:29.300
 maybe a piece of that,

1:57:29.300 --> 1:57:30.940
 but I would call that as part of physics.

1:57:30.940 --> 1:57:33.560
 To me, reality is what we're after.

1:57:33.560 --> 1:57:35.720
 I don't claim I know everything about reality.

1:57:35.720 --> 1:57:38.660
 I don't claim string theory necessarily has the tools

1:57:38.660 --> 1:57:41.300
 right now to describe all the reality either,

1:57:41.300 --> 1:57:42.380
 but we are learning what it is.

1:57:42.380 --> 1:57:44.860
 So I would say that I would not put a border to say,

1:57:44.860 --> 1:57:47.140
 no, from this point onwards, it's not my territory,

1:57:47.140 --> 1:57:48.420
 it's somebody else's.

1:57:48.420 --> 1:57:50.860
 But whether we need new ideas in string theory

1:57:50.860 --> 1:57:53.980
 to describe other reality features, for sure I believe,

1:57:53.980 --> 1:57:57.100
 as I mentioned, I don't believe any of the laws

1:57:57.100 --> 1:57:58.140
 we know today is final.

1:57:58.140 --> 1:58:00.860
 So therefore, yes, we will need new ideas.

1:58:00.860 --> 1:58:03.540
 This is a very tricky thing for us to understand

1:58:05.340 --> 1:58:08.100
 and be precise about.

1:58:08.100 --> 1:58:12.780
 But just because you understand the physics

1:58:12.780 --> 1:58:17.040
 doesn't necessarily mean that you understand

1:58:17.040 --> 1:58:21.800
 the emergence of chemistry, biology, life,

1:58:21.800 --> 1:58:23.840
 intelligence, consciousness.

1:58:23.840 --> 1:58:27.780
 So those are built, it's like you might understand

1:58:27.780 --> 1:58:32.780
 the way bricks work, but to understand what it means

1:58:32.860 --> 1:58:37.620
 to have a happy family, you don't get from the bricks.

1:58:37.620 --> 1:58:42.300
 So directly, in theory you could,

1:58:42.300 --> 1:58:44.780
 if you ran the universe over again,

1:58:44.780 --> 1:58:47.460
 but just understanding the rules of the universe

1:58:47.460 --> 1:58:49.900
 doesn't necessarily give you a sense

1:58:49.900 --> 1:58:52.260
 of the weird, beautiful things that emerge.

1:58:52.260 --> 1:58:55.380
 Right, no, so let me describe what you just said.

1:58:55.380 --> 1:58:56.220
 So there are two questions.

1:58:56.220 --> 1:58:58.540
 One is whether or not the techniques I use

1:58:58.540 --> 1:59:00.620
 in let's say quantum field theory and so on

1:59:00.620 --> 1:59:02.420
 will describe how the society works.

1:59:02.420 --> 1:59:03.260
 Yes.

1:59:03.260 --> 1:59:06.500
 Okay, that's far different scales of questions

1:59:06.500 --> 1:59:08.260
 that we're asking here.

1:59:08.260 --> 1:59:10.540
 The question is, is there a change of,

1:59:10.540 --> 1:59:12.940
 is there a new law which takes over

1:59:12.940 --> 1:59:15.420
 that cannot be connected to the older laws

1:59:15.420 --> 1:59:18.100
 that we know, or more fundamental laws that we know?

1:59:18.100 --> 1:59:20.340
 Do you need new laws to describe it?

1:59:20.340 --> 1:59:21.980
 I don't think that's necessarily the case

1:59:21.980 --> 1:59:23.660
 in many of these phenomena like chemistry

1:59:23.660 --> 1:59:25.240
 or so on you mentioned.

1:59:25.240 --> 1:59:27.700
 So we do expect in principle chemistry

1:59:27.700 --> 1:59:29.620
 can be described by quantum mechanics.

1:59:29.620 --> 1:59:31.620
 We don't think there's gonna be a magical thing,

1:59:31.620 --> 1:59:32.980
 but chemistry is complicated.

1:59:32.980 --> 1:59:34.840
 Yeah, indeed, there are rules of chemistry

1:59:34.840 --> 1:59:37.820
 that chemists have put down which has not been explained yet

1:59:37.820 --> 1:59:39.460
 using quantum mechanics.

1:59:39.460 --> 1:59:41.100
 Do I believe that they will be something

1:59:41.100 --> 1:59:42.160
 described by quantum mechanics?

1:59:42.160 --> 1:59:43.000
 Yes, I do.

1:59:43.000 --> 1:59:44.940
 I don't think they are going to be sitting there

1:59:44.940 --> 1:59:47.060
 in this just forever, but maybe it's too complicated

1:59:47.060 --> 1:59:50.340
 and maybe we'll wait for very powerful quantum computers

1:59:50.340 --> 1:59:51.620
 or whatnot to solve those problems.

1:59:51.620 --> 1:59:52.620
 I don't know.

1:59:52.620 --> 1:59:54.760
 But I don't think in that context

1:59:54.760 --> 1:59:57.980
 we have new principles to be added to fix those.

1:59:57.980 --> 2:00:01.780
 So I'm perfectly fine in the intermediate situation

2:00:01.780 --> 2:00:04.860
 to have rules of thumb or principles that chemists have found

2:00:04.860 --> 2:00:06.940
 which are working, which are not founded

2:00:06.940 --> 2:00:10.420
 on the basis of quantum mechanical laws, which does the job.

2:00:10.420 --> 2:00:13.320
 Similarly, as biologists do not found everything

2:00:13.320 --> 2:00:15.460
 in terms of chemistry, but they think,

2:00:15.460 --> 2:00:16.740
 there's no reason why chemistry cannot.

2:00:16.740 --> 2:00:18.780
 They don't think necessarily they're doing something

2:00:18.780 --> 2:00:20.980
 amazingly not possible with chemistry.

2:00:20.980 --> 2:00:22.220
 Coming back to your question,

2:00:22.220 --> 2:00:26.180
 does consciousness, for example, bring this new ingredient?

2:00:26.180 --> 2:00:28.260
 If indeed it needs a new ingredient,

2:00:28.260 --> 2:00:30.540
 I will call that new ingredient part of physical law.

2:00:30.540 --> 2:00:31.700
 We have to understand it.

2:00:31.700 --> 2:00:34.500
 To me that, so I wouldn't put a line to say,

2:00:34.500 --> 2:00:37.380
 okay, from this point onwards, it's disconnected.

2:00:37.380 --> 2:00:39.520
 It's fully disconnected from string theory or whatever.

2:00:39.520 --> 2:00:41.100
 We have to do something else.

2:00:41.100 --> 2:00:42.340
 It's not a line.

2:00:42.340 --> 2:00:45.800
 What I'm referring to is can physics of a few centuries

2:00:45.800 --> 2:00:48.220
 from now that doesn't understand consciousness

2:00:48.220 --> 2:00:51.620
 be much bigger than the physics of today,

2:00:51.620 --> 2:00:53.980
 where the textbook grows?

2:00:53.980 --> 2:00:54.940
 It definitely will.

2:00:54.940 --> 2:00:55.980
 I would say, it will grow.

2:00:55.980 --> 2:00:58.820
 I don't know if it grows because of consciousness

2:00:58.820 --> 2:01:01.220
 being part of it or we have different view of consciousness.

2:01:01.220 --> 2:01:03.780
 I do not know where the consciousness will fit.

2:01:03.780 --> 2:01:07.540
 It's gonna be hard for me to guess.

2:01:07.540 --> 2:01:09.420
 I mean, I can make random guesses now

2:01:09.420 --> 2:01:11.420
 which probably most likely is wrong,

2:01:11.420 --> 2:01:14.740
 but let me just do just for the sake of discussion.

2:01:14.740 --> 2:01:18.180
 I could say, brain could be their quantum computer,

2:01:18.180 --> 2:01:19.020
 classical computer.

2:01:19.020 --> 2:01:20.820
 Their arguments against this being a quantum thing,

2:01:20.820 --> 2:01:22.980
 so it's probably classical, and if it's classical,

2:01:22.980 --> 2:01:24.660
 it could be like what we are doing in machine learning,

2:01:24.660 --> 2:01:26.220
 slightly more fancy and so on.

2:01:26.220 --> 2:01:28.540
 Okay, people can go to this argument to no end

2:01:28.540 --> 2:01:30.120
 and to some whether consciousness exists or not,

2:01:30.120 --> 2:01:32.320
 or life, does it have any meaning?

2:01:32.320 --> 2:01:34.780
 Or is there a phase transition where you can say,

2:01:34.780 --> 2:01:36.700
 does electron have a life or not?

2:01:36.700 --> 2:01:39.140
 At what level does a particle become life?

2:01:39.140 --> 2:01:41.300
 Maybe there's no definite definition of life

2:01:41.300 --> 2:01:43.860
 in that same way that, we cannot say electron,

2:01:43.860 --> 2:01:48.860
 if you, I like this example quite a bit.

2:01:48.860 --> 2:01:51.160
 We distinguish between liquid and a gas phase,

2:01:51.160 --> 2:01:53.860
 like water is liquid or vapor is gas,

2:01:53.860 --> 2:01:54.700
 and we say they're different.

2:01:54.700 --> 2:01:55.740
 You can distinguish them.

2:01:55.740 --> 2:01:57.340
 Actually, that's not true.

2:01:57.340 --> 2:01:59.860
 It's not true because we know from physics

2:01:59.860 --> 2:02:01.960
 that you can change temperatures and pressure

2:02:01.960 --> 2:02:03.660
 to go from liquid to the gas

2:02:03.660 --> 2:02:05.700
 without making any phase transition.

2:02:05.700 --> 2:02:08.460
 So there is no point that you can say this was a liquid

2:02:08.460 --> 2:02:10.180
 and this was a gas.

2:02:10.180 --> 2:02:12.060
 You can continuously change the parameters

2:02:12.060 --> 2:02:13.820
 to go from one to the other.

2:02:13.820 --> 2:02:15.860
 So at the end, it's very different looking.

2:02:15.860 --> 2:02:18.060
 Like, I know that water is different from vapor,

2:02:18.060 --> 2:02:21.260
 but there's no precise point this happens.

2:02:21.260 --> 2:02:24.020
 I feel many of these things that we think,

2:02:24.020 --> 2:02:25.940
 like consciousness, clearly dead person

2:02:25.940 --> 2:02:27.220
 is not conscious and the other one is.

2:02:27.220 --> 2:02:30.480
 So there's a difference like water and vapor,

2:02:30.480 --> 2:02:32.860
 but there's no point you could say that this is conscious.

2:02:32.860 --> 2:02:34.180
 There's no sharp transition.

2:02:34.180 --> 2:02:38.420
 So it could very well be that what we call heuristically

2:02:38.420 --> 2:02:41.020
 in daily life, consciousness is similar,

2:02:41.020 --> 2:02:43.140
 or life is similar to that.

2:02:43.140 --> 2:02:44.500
 I don't know if it's like that or not.

2:02:44.500 --> 2:02:46.540
 I'm just hypothesizing it's possible.

2:02:46.540 --> 2:02:48.260
 Like there's no.

2:02:48.260 --> 2:02:49.380
 There's no discrete phases.

2:02:49.380 --> 2:02:51.060
 There's no discrete phase transition like that.

2:02:51.060 --> 2:02:56.060
 Yeah, yeah, but there might be concepts of temperature

2:02:56.580 --> 2:02:59.340
 and pressure that we need to understand

2:02:59.340 --> 2:03:02.740
 to describe what the head consciousness in life is

2:03:02.740 --> 2:03:04.900
 that we're totally missing.

2:03:04.900 --> 2:03:07.420
 I think that's not a useless question.

2:03:07.420 --> 2:03:08.780
 Even those questions,

2:03:08.780 --> 2:03:11.740
 they is back to our original discussion of philosophy.

2:03:11.740 --> 2:03:15.220
 I would say consciousness and free will, for example,

2:03:15.220 --> 2:03:18.900
 are topics that are very much so

2:03:18.900 --> 2:03:20.860
 in the realm of philosophy currently.

2:03:20.860 --> 2:03:21.700
 Yes.

2:03:21.700 --> 2:03:22.980
 But I don't think they will always be.

2:03:22.980 --> 2:03:23.940
 I agree with you.

2:03:23.940 --> 2:03:24.760
 I agree with you.

2:03:24.760 --> 2:03:27.060
 And I think I'm fine with some topics

2:03:27.060 --> 2:03:29.820
 being part of a different realm than physics today

2:03:29.820 --> 2:03:32.180
 because we don't have the right tools,

2:03:32.180 --> 2:03:33.360
 just like biology was.

2:03:33.360 --> 2:03:35.620
 I mean, before we had DNA and all that genetics

2:03:35.620 --> 2:03:37.660
 and all that gradually began to take hold.

2:03:37.660 --> 2:03:42.100
 I mean, when people were beginning phase experiments

2:03:42.100 --> 2:03:44.180
 with biology and chemistry and so on,

2:03:44.180 --> 2:03:46.040
 gradually they came together.

2:03:46.040 --> 2:03:47.300
 So it wasn't like together.

2:03:47.300 --> 2:03:49.940
 So yeah, I'd be perfectly understanding of a situation

2:03:49.940 --> 2:03:51.540
 where we don't have the tools.

2:03:51.540 --> 2:03:53.340
 So do these experiments that you think

2:03:53.340 --> 2:03:55.180
 as defines a conscious in different form

2:03:55.180 --> 2:03:57.220
 and gradually we'll build it and connect it.

2:03:57.220 --> 2:03:59.660
 And yes, we might discover new principles of nature

2:03:59.660 --> 2:04:01.100
 that we didn't know.

2:04:01.100 --> 2:04:03.420
 I don't know, but I would say that if they are,

2:04:03.420 --> 2:04:04.700
 they will be deeply connected with the else.

2:04:04.700 --> 2:04:06.980
 We have seen in physics,

2:04:06.980 --> 2:04:08.300
 we don't have things in isolation.

2:04:08.300 --> 2:04:10.820
 You cannot compartmentalize,

2:04:10.820 --> 2:04:13.300
 this is gravity, this is electricity, this is that.

2:04:13.300 --> 2:04:15.220
 We have learned they all talk to each other.

2:04:15.220 --> 2:04:19.060
 There's no way to make them in one corner and don't talk.

2:04:19.060 --> 2:04:21.300
 So the same thing with anything, anything which is real.

2:04:21.300 --> 2:04:22.380
 So consciousness is real.

2:04:22.380 --> 2:04:25.200
 So therefore we have to connect it to everything else.

2:04:25.200 --> 2:04:26.640
 So to me, once you connect it,

2:04:26.640 --> 2:04:27.860
 you cannot say it's not reality.

2:04:27.860 --> 2:04:29.860
 And once it's reality, it's physics.

2:04:29.860 --> 2:04:30.700
 I call it physics.

2:04:30.700 --> 2:04:32.980
 It may not be the physics I know today, for sure it's not,

2:04:32.980 --> 2:04:37.300
 but I would be surprised if there's disconnected realities

2:04:37.300 --> 2:04:41.260
 that you cannot imagine them as part of the same soup.

2:04:41.260 --> 2:04:45.180
 So I guess God doesn't have a biology or chemistry textbook

2:04:45.180 --> 2:04:49.460
 and mostly, or maybe he or she reads it for fun,

2:04:49.460 --> 2:04:50.500
 biology and chemistry,

2:04:50.500 --> 2:04:52.100
 but when you're trying to get some work done,

2:04:52.100 --> 2:04:54.500
 it'll be going to the physics textbook.

2:04:54.500 --> 2:04:59.500
 Okay, what advice, let's put on your wise visionary hat.

2:04:59.500 --> 2:05:03.860
 What advice do you have for young people today?

2:05:03.860 --> 2:05:08.060
 You've dedicated your book actually to your kids,

2:05:08.060 --> 2:05:09.620
 to your family.

2:05:09.620 --> 2:05:11.500
 What advice would you give to them?

2:05:11.500 --> 2:05:13.880
 What advice would you give to young people today

2:05:13.880 --> 2:05:16.780
 thinking about their career, thinking about life,

2:05:16.780 --> 2:05:19.820
 of how to live successful life, how to live a good life?

2:05:19.820 --> 2:05:23.020
 Yes, yes, I have three sons.

2:05:23.020 --> 2:05:26.900
 And in fact, to them, I have tried not to give

2:05:26.900 --> 2:05:28.280
 too much advice.

2:05:28.280 --> 2:05:31.420
 So even though I've tried to kind of not give advice,

2:05:31.420 --> 2:05:33.920
 maybe indirectly it has been some impact.

2:05:33.920 --> 2:05:36.020
 My oldest one is doing biophysics, for example,

2:05:36.020 --> 2:05:38.320
 and the second one is doing machine learning

2:05:38.320 --> 2:05:40.620
 and the third one is doing theoretical computer science.

2:05:40.620 --> 2:05:42.500
 So there are these facets of interest

2:05:42.500 --> 2:05:44.660
 which are not too far from my area,

2:05:44.660 --> 2:05:47.980
 but I have not tried to impact them in that way,

2:05:47.980 --> 2:05:49.980
 but they have followed their own interests.

2:05:49.980 --> 2:05:51.860
 And I think that's the advice I would give

2:05:51.860 --> 2:05:54.980
 to any young person, follow your own interests

2:05:54.980 --> 2:05:58.580
 and let that take you wherever it takes you.

2:05:58.580 --> 2:06:03.380
 And this I did in my own case that I was planning

2:06:03.380 --> 2:06:06.220
 to study economics and electrical engineering

2:06:06.220 --> 2:06:08.100
 when I started at MIT.

2:06:08.100 --> 2:06:10.620
 And I discovered that I'm more passionate

2:06:10.620 --> 2:06:11.700
 about math and physics.

2:06:11.700 --> 2:06:14.020
 And at that time I didn't feel math and physics

2:06:14.020 --> 2:06:15.860
 would make a good career.

2:06:15.860 --> 2:06:18.540
 And so I was kind of hesitant to go in that direction,

2:06:18.540 --> 2:06:20.560
 but I did because I kind of felt that

2:06:20.560 --> 2:06:22.580
 that's what I'm driven to do.

2:06:22.580 --> 2:06:26.260
 So I don't regret it, I'm lucky in the sense

2:06:26.260 --> 2:06:28.340
 that society supports people like me

2:06:28.340 --> 2:06:29.900
 who are doing these abstract stuff,

2:06:29.900 --> 2:06:32.540
 which may or may not be experimentally verified

2:06:32.540 --> 2:06:36.380
 even let alone applied to the technology in our lifetimes.

2:06:36.380 --> 2:06:37.660
 I'm lucky I'm doing that.

2:06:37.660 --> 2:06:41.300
 And I feel that if people follow their interests,

2:06:41.300 --> 2:06:43.960
 they will find the niche that they're good at.

2:06:43.960 --> 2:06:48.020
 And this coincidence of hopefully their interests

2:06:48.020 --> 2:06:51.860
 and abilities are kind of aligned,

2:06:51.860 --> 2:06:54.420
 at least some extent to be able to drive them

2:06:54.420 --> 2:06:56.260
 to something which is successful.

2:06:56.260 --> 2:06:58.540
 And not to be driven by things like,

2:06:58.540 --> 2:07:00.020
 this doesn't make a good career,

2:07:00.020 --> 2:07:02.400
 or this doesn't do that, and my parents expect that,

2:07:02.400 --> 2:07:03.240
 or what about this?

2:07:03.240 --> 2:07:06.140
 And I think ultimately you have to live with yourself

2:07:06.140 --> 2:07:08.660
 and you only have one life and it's short, very short.

2:07:08.660 --> 2:07:10.580
 I can tell you I'm getting there.

2:07:10.580 --> 2:07:11.500
 So I know it's short.

2:07:11.500 --> 2:07:14.980
 So you really want not to do things

2:07:14.980 --> 2:07:15.900
 that you don't want to do.

2:07:15.900 --> 2:07:17.340
 So I think following an interest

2:07:17.340 --> 2:07:19.300
 is my strongest advice to young people.

2:07:19.300 --> 2:07:22.180
 Yeah, it's scary when your interest

2:07:22.180 --> 2:07:26.620
 doesn't directly map to a career of the past or of today.

2:07:26.620 --> 2:07:28.700
 So you're almost anticipating future careers

2:07:28.700 --> 2:07:29.640
 that could be created.

2:07:29.640 --> 2:07:30.480
 It's scary.

2:07:32.320 --> 2:07:34.180
 But yeah, there's something to that,

2:07:34.180 --> 2:07:36.820
 especially when the interest and the ability align,

2:07:36.820 --> 2:07:39.620
 that you will pave a path,

2:07:39.620 --> 2:07:41.220
 that will find a way to make money,

2:07:41.220 --> 2:07:42.660
 especially in this society,

2:07:42.660 --> 2:07:46.220
 in a capitalistic United States society.

2:07:46.220 --> 2:07:51.220
 It feels like ability and passion paves the way.

2:07:52.260 --> 2:07:53.100
 Yes.

2:07:54.500 --> 2:07:56.940
 At the very least, you can sell funny T shirts.

2:07:56.940 --> 2:07:57.780
 Yes.

2:07:57.780 --> 2:07:59.940
 You've mentioned life is short.

2:08:00.820 --> 2:08:04.140
 Do you think about your mortality?

2:08:04.140 --> 2:08:05.900
 Are you afraid of death?

2:08:05.900 --> 2:08:08.100
 I don't think about my mortality.

2:08:09.540 --> 2:08:12.460
 I think that I don't think about my death.

2:08:12.460 --> 2:08:14.700
 I don't think about death in general too much.

2:08:14.700 --> 2:08:16.820
 First of all, it's something that I can't do much about,

2:08:16.820 --> 2:08:18.180
 and I think it's something

2:08:18.180 --> 2:08:21.640
 that it doesn't drive my everyday action.

2:08:21.640 --> 2:08:23.300
 It is natural to expect

2:08:23.300 --> 2:08:25.940
 that it's somewhat like the time reversal situation.

2:08:25.940 --> 2:08:27.940
 So we believe that we have this approximate symmetry

2:08:27.940 --> 2:08:29.440
 in nature, time reversal.

2:08:29.440 --> 2:08:30.500
 Going forward, we die.

2:08:30.500 --> 2:08:32.300
 Going backwards, we get born.

2:08:32.300 --> 2:08:35.060
 So what was it to get born?

2:08:35.060 --> 2:08:37.340
 It wasn't such a good or bad feeling.

2:08:37.340 --> 2:08:38.780
 I have no feeling of it.

2:08:38.780 --> 2:08:42.140
 So who knows what the death will feel like,

2:08:42.140 --> 2:08:43.460
 the moment of death or whatnot.

2:08:43.460 --> 2:08:44.660
 So I don't know.

2:08:44.660 --> 2:08:45.500
 It is not known,

2:08:45.500 --> 2:08:50.160
 but in what form do we exist before or after?

2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:53.740
 Again, it's something that it's partly philosophical maybe.

2:08:53.740 --> 2:08:55.900
 I like how you draw comfort from symmetry.

2:08:55.900 --> 2:08:58.660
 It does seem that there is something asymmetric here,

2:08:58.660 --> 2:08:59.700
 a breaking of symmetry,

2:08:59.700 --> 2:09:04.700
 because there's something to the creative force

2:09:05.940 --> 2:09:09.580
 of the human spirit that goes only one way.

2:09:09.580 --> 2:09:10.400
 Right.

2:09:10.400 --> 2:09:13.140
 That it seems the finiteness of life

2:09:13.140 --> 2:09:15.940
 is the thing that drives the creativity.

2:09:15.940 --> 2:09:20.940
 And so it does seem that at least the contemplation

2:09:21.540 --> 2:09:24.580
 of the finiteness of life, of mortality,

2:09:24.580 --> 2:09:27.100
 is the thing that helps you get your stuff together.

2:09:27.100 --> 2:09:28.140
 Yes, I think that's true,

2:09:28.140 --> 2:09:29.560
 but actually I have a different perspective

2:09:29.560 --> 2:09:30.400
 on that a little bit.

2:09:30.400 --> 2:09:31.240
 Yes.

2:09:31.240 --> 2:09:34.820
 Namely, suppose I told you you're immortal.

2:09:34.820 --> 2:09:35.660
 Yes.

2:09:37.120 --> 2:09:39.780
 I think your life will be totally boring after that,

2:09:39.780 --> 2:09:41.460
 because you will not,

2:09:41.460 --> 2:09:45.960
 I think part of the reason we have enjoyment in life

2:09:45.960 --> 2:09:47.280
 is the finiteness of it.

2:09:47.280 --> 2:09:48.120
 Yes.

2:09:48.120 --> 2:09:52.180
 And so I think mortality might be a blessing,

2:09:52.180 --> 2:09:54.000
 and immortality may not.

2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:55.960
 So I think that we value things

2:09:55.960 --> 2:09:58.080
 because we have that finite life.

2:09:58.080 --> 2:09:59.300
 We appreciate things.

2:09:59.300 --> 2:10:00.140
 We want to do this.

2:10:00.140 --> 2:10:00.960
 We want to do that.

2:10:00.960 --> 2:10:01.800
 We have motivation.

2:10:01.800 --> 2:10:03.080
 If I told you, you know, you have infinite life.

2:10:03.080 --> 2:10:04.700
 Oh, I don't, I don't need to do this today.

2:10:04.700 --> 2:10:08.520
 I have another billion or trillion or infinite life.

2:10:08.520 --> 2:10:10.160
 So why do I do now?

2:10:10.160 --> 2:10:11.840
 There is no motivation.

2:10:11.840 --> 2:10:13.600
 A lot of the things that we do

2:10:13.600 --> 2:10:16.960
 are driven by that finiteness of these resources.

2:10:16.960 --> 2:10:20.100
 So I think it is a blessing in disguise.

2:10:20.100 --> 2:10:23.380
 I don't regret it that we have more finite life.

2:10:23.380 --> 2:10:28.380
 And I think that the process of being part of this thing,

2:10:31.040 --> 2:10:33.080
 that, you know, the reality,

2:10:33.080 --> 2:10:36.400
 to me, part of what attracts me to science

2:10:36.400 --> 2:10:39.700
 is to connect to that immortality kind of,

2:10:39.700 --> 2:10:43.940
 namely the laws, the reality beyond us.

2:10:43.940 --> 2:10:47.900
 To me, I'm resigned to the fact that not only me,

2:10:47.900 --> 2:10:49.780
 everybody's going to die.

2:10:49.780 --> 2:10:51.940
 So this is a little bit of a consolation.

2:10:51.940 --> 2:10:53.860
 None of us are going to be around.

2:10:53.860 --> 2:10:55.220
 So therefore, okay,

2:10:55.220 --> 2:10:57.380
 and none of the people before me are around.

2:10:57.380 --> 2:10:58.620
 So therefore, yeah, okay,

2:10:58.620 --> 2:10:59.940
 this is something everybody goes through.

2:10:59.940 --> 2:11:03.420
 So taking that minuscule version of,

2:11:03.420 --> 2:11:07.520
 okay, how tiny we are and how short time it is and so on,

2:11:07.520 --> 2:11:10.140
 to connect to the deeper truth beyond us,

2:11:10.140 --> 2:11:11.900
 the reality beyond us,

2:11:11.900 --> 2:11:16.820
 is what sense of, quote unquote, immortality I would get.

2:11:16.820 --> 2:11:18.780
 Namely, at least I can hang on

2:11:18.780 --> 2:11:20.700
 to this little piece of truth,

2:11:20.700 --> 2:11:23.180
 even though I know, I know it's not complete.

2:11:23.180 --> 2:11:25.780
 I know it's going to be imperfect.

2:11:25.780 --> 2:11:28.420
 I know it's going to change and it's going to be improved.

2:11:28.420 --> 2:11:30.580
 But having a little bit deeper insight

2:11:30.580 --> 2:11:32.700
 than just the naive thing around us,

2:11:32.700 --> 2:11:35.240
 little earth here and little galaxy and so on,

2:11:35.240 --> 2:11:40.140
 makes me feel a little bit more pleasure to live this life.

2:11:40.140 --> 2:11:43.180
 So I think that's the way I view my role as a scientist.

2:11:43.180 --> 2:11:48.180
 Yeah, the scarcity of this life helps us appreciate

2:11:48.380 --> 2:11:50.180
 the beauty of the immortal,

2:11:50.180 --> 2:11:53.700
 the universal truths of that physics present us.

2:11:53.700 --> 2:11:58.700
 And maybe one day physics will have something to say

2:11:58.900 --> 2:12:03.380
 about that beauty in itself,

2:12:03.380 --> 2:12:06.540
 explaining why the heck it's so beautiful

2:12:06.540 --> 2:12:08.280
 to appreciate the laws of physics,

2:12:08.280 --> 2:12:13.280
 and yet why it's so tragic that we would die so quickly.

2:12:14.660 --> 2:12:16.160
 Yes, we die so quickly.

2:12:16.160 --> 2:12:18.100
 So that can be a bit longer, that's for sure.

2:12:18.100 --> 2:12:19.220
 It would be very nice.

2:12:19.220 --> 2:12:20.820
 Maybe physics will help out.

2:12:20.820 --> 2:12:23.880
 Well, Kamran, it was an incredible conversation.

2:12:23.880 --> 2:12:25.120
 Thank you so much once again

2:12:25.120 --> 2:12:28.340
 for painting a beautiful picture of the history of physics.

2:12:28.340 --> 2:12:32.420
 And it kind of presents a hopeful view

2:12:32.420 --> 2:12:33.500
 of the future of physics.

2:12:33.500 --> 2:12:35.780
 So I really, really appreciate that.

2:12:35.780 --> 2:12:37.380
 It's a huge honor that you would talk to me

2:12:37.380 --> 2:12:39.300
 and waste all your valuable time with me.

2:12:39.300 --> 2:12:40.140
 I really appreciate it.

2:12:40.140 --> 2:12:40.960
 Thanks, Lex.

2:12:40.960 --> 2:12:42.740
 It was a pleasure, and I loved talking with you.

2:12:42.740 --> 2:12:44.500
 And this is wonderful set of discussions.

2:12:44.500 --> 2:12:46.460
 I really enjoyed my time with this discussion.

2:12:46.460 --> 2:12:47.940
 Thank you.

2:12:47.940 --> 2:12:49.420
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:12:49.420 --> 2:12:50.580
 with Kamran Vafa.

2:12:50.580 --> 2:12:54.220
 And thank you to Headspace, Jordan Harmerjee Show,

2:12:54.220 --> 2:12:56.620

2:12:56.620 --> 2:13:00.180
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:13:00.180 --> 2:13:02.620
 And now, let me leave you with some words

2:13:02.620 --> 2:13:04.960
 from the great Richard Feynman.

2:13:04.960 --> 2:13:07.660
 "'Physics isn't the most important thing.

2:13:07.660 --> 2:13:08.660
 "'Love is.'"

2:13:08.660 --> 2:13:29.660
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
