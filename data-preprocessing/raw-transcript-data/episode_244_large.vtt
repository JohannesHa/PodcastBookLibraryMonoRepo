00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
 The following is a conversation with Robert Cruz,

00:02.640 --> 00:06.560
 a historian at Stanford, specializing in the history

00:06.560 --> 00:09.800
 of Afghanistan, Russia, and Islam.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.020
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:12.020 --> 00:14.040
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:14.040 --> 00:15.240
 in the description.

00:15.240 --> 00:19.000
 And now, here's my conversation with Robert Cruz.

00:19.880 --> 00:22.120
 Was it a mistake for the United States

00:22.120 --> 00:25.920
 to invade Afghanistan in 2001, 20 years ago?

00:25.920 --> 00:27.440
 Yes.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.440
 As simple as yes, why was it a mistake?

00:30.440 --> 00:33.680
 I'm a historian, so I say this with some humility

00:33.680 --> 00:35.080
 about what we can know.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.680
 I think I'd still like to know much more

00:36.680 --> 00:39.080
 about what was going on in the White House

00:39.080 --> 00:42.200
 in the hours, days, weeks after 9 11.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.320
 But I think the George W. Bush administration

00:45.320 --> 00:47.000
 acted in a state of panic.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.080
 And I think they wanted to show a kind of toughness.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.880
 They wanted to show some kind of resolve.

00:51.880 --> 00:55.120
 This was a horrific act that played out

00:55.120 --> 00:57.280
 on everyone's television screens.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.600
 And I think it was really fundamentally

00:59.600 --> 01:01.600
 a crisis of legitimacy within the White House,

01:01.600 --> 01:02.440
 within the Oval Office.

01:02.440 --> 01:05.200
 And I think they felt like they had to do something

01:05.200 --> 01:06.640
 and something dramatic.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.880
 I think they didn't really think through

01:08.880 --> 01:11.880
 who they were fighting, who the enemy was,

01:11.880 --> 01:14.680
 what this geography had to do with 9 11.

01:14.680 --> 01:17.160
 I think looking back at it, I mean, some of us,

01:17.160 --> 01:19.800
 not to say I was clairvoyant or could see into the future,

01:19.800 --> 01:22.360
 but I think many of us were, from that morning,

01:22.360 --> 01:24.240
 skeptical about the connections that people were drawing

01:24.240 --> 01:27.560
 between Afghanistan as a state, as a place,

01:27.560 --> 01:30.160
 and the actions of Al Qaeda in Washington

01:30.160 --> 01:32.960
 and New York and Pennsylvania.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.880
 So as you watch the events of 9 11,

01:35.880 --> 01:40.240
 the things that our leaders were saying

01:40.240 --> 01:44.720
 in the minutes, hours, days, weeks that followed,

01:44.720 --> 01:47.720
 maybe you can give a little bit of a timeline

01:47.720 --> 01:49.680
 of what was being said.

01:49.680 --> 01:52.240
 One was the actual invasion of Afghanistan.

01:52.240 --> 01:55.320
 And also, what were your feelings

01:55.320 --> 01:59.400
 in the minutes, weeks after 9 11?

01:59.400 --> 02:00.360
 I was in DC.

02:00.360 --> 02:04.120
 I was on the way to American University

02:04.120 --> 02:07.200
 hearing on NPR what had happened.

02:07.200 --> 02:10.520
 And I thought of the American University logo,

02:10.520 --> 02:11.720
 which is red, white, and blue.

02:11.720 --> 02:12.960
 It's an eagle.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.360
 And I thought Washington is under attack

02:15.360 --> 02:18.600
 and symbols of American power are under attack.

02:18.600 --> 02:22.200
 And so I was quite concerned and at the time lived

02:22.200 --> 02:24.760
 just a few miles from the capital.

02:24.760 --> 02:28.360
 And so I felt that it was real.

02:28.360 --> 02:32.240
 So I appreciate the sense of anxiety and fear and panic.

02:32.240 --> 02:35.320
 And four, two, three years later in DC,

02:35.320 --> 02:37.680
 we were constantly getting reports,

02:37.680 --> 02:40.800
 mostly rumors and unconfirmed about all kinds of attacks

02:40.800 --> 02:41.640
 that befall the city.

02:41.640 --> 02:46.200
 So I definitely appreciate the sense of being under assault.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.240
 But in watching television,

02:47.240 --> 02:48.680
 including Russian television that day,

02:48.680 --> 02:51.200
 because I just installed a satellite thing.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.400
 So I was trying to watch world news

02:52.400 --> 02:53.240
 and get different points of view.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.920
 And that was quite useful

02:54.920 --> 02:57.320
 to have an alternative set of eyes.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.160
 In Russian?

02:58.160 --> 02:59.360
 Yeah, in Russian, yeah.

02:59.360 --> 03:01.440
 Okay, so your Russians is good enough

03:01.440 --> 03:03.120
 to understand Russian television.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.520
 The news, yeah, the news and the visuals that were coming

03:05.520 --> 03:07.920
 that were not shown on American television.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.280
 I don't know how they had it, but they had,

03:09.280 --> 03:11.320
 they were not filtering anything

03:11.320 --> 03:13.080
 in the way that the major networks

03:13.080 --> 03:14.520
 and cable televisions were doing here.

03:14.520 --> 03:17.720
 So it was a very unvarnished view of the violence

03:17.720 --> 03:19.400
 of the moment in New York City

03:19.400 --> 03:22.320
 of people diving from the towers or being,

03:22.320 --> 03:24.440
 and it was really, they didn't hold back on that,

03:24.440 --> 03:26.280
 which was quite fascinating.

03:26.280 --> 03:27.560
 I think much of the world saw much more

03:27.560 --> 03:29.880
 than actually the American public saw.

03:29.880 --> 03:33.760
 But to your question, amid that feeling of imminent doom,

03:33.760 --> 03:36.840
 I watched commentators start to talk about Al Qaeda

03:36.840 --> 03:39.080
 and then talk about Afghanistan.

03:39.080 --> 03:42.880
 And one of the experts was Barnett Rubin,

03:42.880 --> 03:45.760
 who's at NYU, who's a kind of long,

03:45.760 --> 03:48.560
 very learned Afghanistan hand.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.480
 And he's brought on Peter Jennings on ABC News

03:50.480 --> 03:52.800
 to kind of lay this out for everyone.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.320
 And I thought, you know, he did a fine job,

03:55.320 --> 03:57.920
 but I think it was formative in submitting the view

03:57.920 --> 04:00.160
 that somehow Al Qaeda was synonymous

04:00.160 --> 04:02.040
 with this space, Afghanistan.

04:02.040 --> 04:06.240
 And I think, again, I was no Al Qaeda expert then,

04:06.240 --> 04:09.160
 and I'm not now, but I think my immediate thought

04:09.160 --> 04:13.720
 went to war and because my background had been with,

04:13.720 --> 04:15.840
 at that point, mostly Afghans who had been displaced

04:15.840 --> 04:17.720
 from decades of war,

04:17.720 --> 04:19.080
 whom I encountered in Uzbekistan,

04:19.080 --> 04:20.920
 who were refugees and so on.

04:20.920 --> 04:24.080
 I thought immediately, my mind went to the suffering

04:24.080 --> 04:28.240
 of Afghan people, that this war was going to sweep up,

04:28.240 --> 04:30.000
 of course, the defenseless people

04:30.000 --> 04:31.400
 who have nothing to do with these politics.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.280
 So we should give maybe a little bit of context

04:33.280 --> 04:35.200
 that you could speak to.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.240
 So assume nobody's an expert at anything.

04:38.240 --> 04:43.240
 So let's just say you and I are not experts at anything.

04:43.280 --> 04:46.400
 What, as a historian, were you studying at the time

04:46.400 --> 04:51.400
 and thinking about, is it the full global history

04:52.200 --> 04:53.680
 of Afghanistan?

04:53.680 --> 04:55.400
 Is it the region?

04:55.400 --> 04:58.880
 Were you thinking about the Mujahideen

04:58.880 --> 05:01.720
 and Al Qaeda and Taliban?

05:01.720 --> 05:04.160
 Were you thinking about the Soviet Union,

05:04.160 --> 05:06.600
 the proxy war through Afghanistan?

05:06.600 --> 05:09.880
 Were you thinking about Iraq and oil?

05:09.880 --> 05:12.760
 What's the full space of things in your heart,

05:12.760 --> 05:14.320
 in your mind at the time?

05:14.320 --> 05:16.440
 I mean, just at the moment, of course, it was just the sense

05:16.440 --> 05:19.480
 of the suffering and the tragedy

05:19.480 --> 05:21.400
 of the moment of the deaths.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.320
 And that was, I think, I was preoccupied

05:23.320 --> 05:25.360
 by the violence of the moment.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.520
 But as the conversation turned to Afghanistan,

05:28.520 --> 05:31.320
 as a kind of theater, to somehow respond to this moment,

05:31.320 --> 05:32.360
 I think immediately what came to mind

05:32.360 --> 05:34.640
 was that little I knew about Al Qaeda at the time

05:34.640 --> 05:38.120
 suggested that the geography was inaccurate,

05:38.120 --> 05:41.320
 that this was a global network, a global threat,

05:41.320 --> 05:45.200
 that this was a movement that went beyond borders.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.200
 And I think that it felt early on

05:47.200 --> 05:50.480
 that Afghanistan was gonna be used as a scapegoat.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.640
 And intellectually at the time,

05:51.640 --> 05:52.960
 I was teaching at American University.

05:52.960 --> 05:56.320
 My courses touched on a range of subjects,

05:56.320 --> 05:58.240
 but I was trying to complete a book

05:58.240 --> 06:01.160
 on Islam and the Russian Empire, actually.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.040
 But in doing that research, which took me across Russia

06:04.040 --> 06:06.520
 and Central Asia, purely by accident,

06:06.520 --> 06:08.520
 I had developed an interest in Afghanistan

06:08.520 --> 06:12.720
 because just, again, a series of coincidences.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.280
 I found myself in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan,

06:15.280 --> 06:17.960
 without housing, through an American friend

06:17.960 --> 06:20.160
 who was like the king of the market in Tashkent.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.400
 He knew everyone.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.400
 He ran into some Afghan merchants there.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.760
 They found out I didn't have a place to live.

06:26.760 --> 06:28.240
 I didn't know where Afghanistan was, honestly.

06:28.240 --> 06:29.320
 This was 1997.

06:29.320 --> 06:30.560
 I had a vague idea it was next door.

06:30.560 --> 06:32.160
 Well, you lived in Uzbekistan?

06:32.160 --> 06:35.000
 Yeah, in Tashkent, doing dissertation research, yeah.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.880
 Because it was hub of the Russian Empire in Central Asia.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.240
 So just by accident, I met with these young Afghans

06:40.240 --> 06:42.720
 who took me in as roommates.

06:42.720 --> 06:46.240
 And that, I think, the sense of that community

06:46.240 --> 06:48.480
 shaped my idea of what Afghanistan is.

06:48.480 --> 06:51.160
 It was my first exposure to them.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.480
 They were part of a trading diaspora.

06:53.480 --> 06:57.440
 They had brought matches from Riga, Latvia.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.960
 They had somehow brought flour

06:59.960 --> 07:02.800
 and some agricultural products from Egypt.

07:02.800 --> 07:06.480
 And they were sitting in closed containers in Tashkent

07:06.480 --> 07:10.120
 waiting for the Uzbekistan state to permit them to trade.

07:10.120 --> 07:11.880
 So these guys are mostly hanging out during the day.

07:11.880 --> 07:12.800
 They'll get dressed up.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.160
 They put on suits and ties like you're wearing.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.480
 They'd polish their shoes.

07:16.480 --> 07:21.480
 And they would sit around offices, drink tea, pistachios.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.240
 Then they'd feast at lunch.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.120
 And then at night, we would go out.

07:25.120 --> 07:26.800
 So part of my research,

07:26.800 --> 07:28.160
 because I also had a bottleneck in my research,

07:28.160 --> 07:31.880
 I was going to the state archives in Tashkent.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.160
 And because of the state of Uzbekistan,

07:34.160 --> 07:36.560
 that was a very kind of suspicious thing to do.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.200
 So it took a while to get in.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.600
 So I had downtime in Tashkent, just like these guys.

07:41.600 --> 07:42.800
 So I got to know them pretty well.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.880
 And it was really just an accidental kind of thing,

07:45.880 --> 07:47.600
 but grew quite close to them.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.400
 And I developed an appreciation of,

07:50.520 --> 07:53.280
 which now I think, again, thinking of the seeds of all this,

07:53.280 --> 07:55.800
 these people had already lived,

07:55.800 --> 07:57.240
 young guys in their 20s,

07:57.240 --> 07:59.840
 they'd already lived in six or seven countries.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.040
 They all spoke half a dozen languages.

08:02.040 --> 08:05.080
 One of my best friends there had been a kickboxer

08:06.080 --> 08:08.240
 and break dancer, trained in Tehran.

08:08.240 --> 08:11.240
 His father was a theater person in Afghanistan.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.480
 He told stories of escaping death in Afghanistan

08:14.480 --> 08:16.960
 during the civil war, going to Uzbekistan,

08:16.960 --> 08:18.640
 escaping death there.

08:18.640 --> 08:21.200
 And these were very real stories.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.920
 Can you also just briefly mention,

08:23.920 --> 08:25.880
 geographically speaking,

08:25.880 --> 08:29.840
 Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, you mentioned Iran.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.680
 Who are the neighbors of all of this?

08:32.680 --> 08:35.200
 What are we supposed to be thinking about for people?

08:35.200 --> 08:38.800
 I was always terrible at geography and spatial information.

08:38.800 --> 08:39.960
 So can you lay it out?

08:39.960 --> 08:40.960
 Yeah, sure, sure.

08:40.960 --> 08:44.280
 So Tashkent is the capital of Uzbekistan.

08:44.280 --> 08:49.280
 It was a hub of Russian imperial power in the 19th century.

08:49.680 --> 08:52.960
 The Russians take the city from a local kind of Muslim

08:52.960 --> 08:55.360
 dynasty in 1865.

08:55.360 --> 08:59.320
 It becomes the city, the kind of hub of Soviet power

08:59.320 --> 09:01.760
 in Central Asia after 1917.

09:01.760 --> 09:06.760
 It becomes the center of the Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan,

09:06.800 --> 09:09.160
 which becomes independent finally in 1991

09:09.160 --> 09:10.720
 when the Soviet Union collapses.

09:10.720 --> 09:14.400
 So these are all like these republics

09:14.400 --> 09:18.400
 are the fingertips of Soviet power in Central Asia.

09:18.400 --> 09:19.320
 That's right.

09:19.320 --> 09:22.360
 And they've been independent since 1991,

09:22.360 --> 09:25.560
 but they have struggled to disentangle themselves

09:25.560 --> 09:28.280
 from Moscow, from one another.

09:28.280 --> 09:31.320
 And now they face very serious pressure from China

09:31.320 --> 09:34.880
 to form a kind of periphery of the great machine

09:34.880 --> 09:37.680
 that is the Chinese economy and its ambitions

09:37.680 --> 09:39.640
 to stretch across Asia.

09:40.840 --> 09:43.640
 For Afghanistan, where my roommates, my friends

09:43.640 --> 09:48.640
 hailed from, Afghanistan had fallen into civil war

09:49.760 --> 09:52.240
 in the late 1970s when leftists tried

09:52.240 --> 09:54.680
 to seize power there in 1978.

09:54.680 --> 09:58.400
 The Soviet Union then extended from Uzbekistan,

09:58.400 --> 10:01.600
 crossing the border with its forces in 1979

10:01.600 --> 10:03.640
 to try to shore up this leftist government

10:03.640 --> 10:06.360
 that had seized power in 1978.

10:06.360 --> 10:09.760
 And so for Central Asians in the wider region,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.920
 their fate had for some decades been tied to Afghanistan

10:13.920 --> 10:17.400
 in a variety of ways, but it became much more connected

10:17.400 --> 10:21.880
 in the 1980s when the Soviet Red Army occupied Afghanistan

10:21.880 --> 10:23.280
 for 10 years.

10:23.280 --> 10:25.120
 And here, I refer your listeners and viewers

10:25.120 --> 10:28.600
 to Rainbow Three as the guide to.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.080
 The historically accurate guide.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.320
 The historically accurate, the Bible.

10:32.320 --> 10:34.440
 The Bible of Afghan history in Rainbow Three, yeah.

10:34.440 --> 10:39.320
 As a fantastic window onto the American view of the war.

10:39.320 --> 10:41.720
 But for us Afghans, there are people who fought

10:41.720 --> 10:45.640
 against the Soviet army, but of a certain generation,

10:46.560 --> 10:50.840
 the guys I knew, their mission was to survive.

10:50.840 --> 10:54.040
 And so they fled in waves by the millions

10:54.040 --> 10:56.680
 to Pakistan, to Iran.

10:56.680 --> 11:00.520
 Some went north into Soviet Central Asia later in the 1990s.

11:00.520 --> 11:02.200
 And some were displaced across the planet.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.960
 So California, where we're sitting today,

11:03.960 --> 11:07.920
 has a large community that came in the 80s and 90s

11:07.920 --> 11:09.680
 in the East Bay.

11:09.680 --> 11:12.720
 Can I ask a quick question that's a little bit of a tangent?

11:12.720 --> 11:13.920
 Yep.

11:13.920 --> 11:17.720
 What is the correct or the respectful way

11:17.720 --> 11:22.720
 to pronounce Afghanistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iran?

11:25.840 --> 11:28.600
 So as a Russian speaker, Afghanistan.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.040
 Yeah.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.400
 The an versus the an.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.240
 Yeah.

11:33.240 --> 11:34.720
 Is it a different country by country?

11:34.720 --> 11:37.160
 As an English speaker in America,

11:37.160 --> 11:41.360
 is it pretentious and disrespectful to say Afghanistan?

11:41.360 --> 11:44.440
 Or is it the opposite, respectful to say it that way?

11:44.440 --> 11:45.400
 What are your thoughts on this?

11:45.400 --> 11:47.240
 That's a fascinating question.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.160
 I defer to the people from those countries

11:50.160 --> 11:52.600
 to, of course, sort out those politics.

11:52.600 --> 11:55.080
 I think one of the fascinating things about the region

11:55.080 --> 11:57.080
 broadly is that it is a place of so many cultures

11:57.080 --> 12:00.040
 and it's really quite cosmopolitan.

12:00.040 --> 12:02.000
 So I think people are mostly quite forgiving

12:02.000 --> 12:04.560
 about how you say Afghanistan, Afghanistan.

12:04.560 --> 12:05.840
 It's not like Paris.

12:05.840 --> 12:06.680
 Yeah, right, right.

12:06.680 --> 12:07.880
 The French are not forgiving.

12:07.880 --> 12:08.720
 No, no, no.

12:08.720 --> 12:09.560
 Exactly.

12:09.560 --> 12:10.680
 I think people are very, very forgiving.

12:10.680 --> 12:15.680
 And I think that Iranians are a bit more instructive

12:15.680 --> 12:20.680
 in suggesting Iran rather than Iran, Iraq, Iraq.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.960
 I think there's going to be a fit

12:24.960 --> 12:27.440
 between certain ways of pronouncing these places

12:27.440 --> 12:30.960
 and the position that Americans take about them.

12:30.960 --> 12:35.960
 So it's more jarring when people say Iraq

12:36.240 --> 12:41.240
 and it comes with a claim that a certain kind of person

12:41.480 --> 12:43.440
 should be the victim of violence or.

12:43.440 --> 12:44.560
 Yeah, that's fascinating.

12:44.560 --> 12:47.040
 It's kind of like talking about the Democratic Party

12:47.040 --> 12:48.440
 or the Democrat Party.

12:48.440 --> 12:51.720
 It's sometimes using certain kind of terminology

12:51.720 --> 12:56.720
 to make a little bit of a sort of implied statement

12:57.720 --> 12:58.680
 about your beliefs.

12:58.680 --> 12:59.520
 That's fascinating.

12:59.520 --> 13:02.640
 Yeah, I mean, I think when I hear Iraq and Iran,

13:02.640 --> 13:04.840
 I mean, I think it, yeah, is it intentional

13:04.840 --> 13:07.280
 in the case of a Democrat or is it just a,

13:07.280 --> 13:08.120
 you know, and it's a whatever.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.560
 Again, I think most Iranians and Afghans people I know

13:10.560 --> 13:12.880
 have been very cool about that.

13:12.880 --> 13:15.440
 What annoys Afghans now, I can say,

13:15.440 --> 13:16.280
 I think it's fair to say,

13:16.280 --> 13:18.320
 I don't mean to speak for many people,

13:18.320 --> 13:20.080
 for the entire group of people,

13:20.080 --> 13:23.240
 but I can just share with our non Afghan friends.

13:24.360 --> 13:28.600
 The term Afghani is a kind of term of offense

13:28.600 --> 13:29.920
 because that's the name of the currency.

13:29.920 --> 13:34.400
 And so lots of people ask, you know, why having,

13:34.400 --> 13:36.600
 especially again, it's more directed at Americans

13:36.600 --> 13:38.400
 because, you know, we've been so deeply involved

13:38.400 --> 13:40.920
 in that country obviously for the last 20 years, right?

13:40.920 --> 13:43.360
 So Afghans ask why after 20 years,

13:43.360 --> 13:45.320
 are you still calling us the wrong name?

13:45.320 --> 13:47.360
 What is the right name of somebody?

13:47.360 --> 13:48.440
 They prefer Afghans.

13:48.440 --> 13:49.280
 Afghans.

13:49.280 --> 13:52.160
 Yeah, and Afghani is the name of the currency.

13:52.160 --> 13:53.000
 And so.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
 I just dodged a bullet

13:54.000 --> 13:54.840
 because I was gonna say Afghans.

13:54.840 --> 13:56.040
 That's cool, no, no, no, yeah, I hear you.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.280
 That's really great to know.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.360
 Yeah, and it's, again, I think,

13:59.360 --> 14:02.240
 but I would emphasize that people are quite open

14:02.240 --> 14:06.160
 and, you know, it's a whole region of incredible diversity

14:06.160 --> 14:09.800
 and respect for linguistic pluralism actually.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.200
 So I think that, you know,

14:11.200 --> 14:14.240
 but I also appreciate that in this context,

14:14.240 --> 14:16.120
 when there's a lot of pain, you know,

14:16.120 --> 14:18.840
 in the Afghan diaspora community in particular,

14:18.840 --> 14:22.000
 you know, being called the wrong name after 20 years

14:22.000 --> 14:24.800
 when they already feel so betrayed at this moment,

14:24.800 --> 14:25.760
 you know, just kind of,

14:25.760 --> 14:27.960
 if one follows this on social media,

14:27.960 --> 14:32.160
 that is one kind of hot wire, right?

14:32.160 --> 14:35.400
 Yeah, so the reason I ask about pronunciation

14:35.400 --> 14:37.360
 is because, yes, it is true

14:37.360 --> 14:39.880
 that there are certain things when mispronounced

14:39.880 --> 14:42.800
 kind of reveal that you don't care enough

14:42.800 --> 14:44.320
 to pronounce correctly.

14:44.320 --> 14:47.040
 So I don't know enough to pronounce correctly

14:47.040 --> 14:49.760
 and you dismiss the culture and the people,

14:49.760 --> 14:53.360
 which I think as per your writing is something that,

14:54.960 --> 14:57.160
 if it's okay, I'll go with Afghanistan

14:57.160 --> 14:58.480
 just because I'm used to it.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.520
 I say Iraq, Iran, but I say Afghanistan.

15:01.520 --> 15:02.880
 Yeah, that's great.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.560
 As you do in your writing,

15:04.560 --> 15:07.360
 Afghanistan suffers from much misunderstanding

15:07.360 --> 15:08.640
 from the rest of the world.

15:08.640 --> 15:13.640
 But back to our discussion of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,

15:13.800 --> 15:17.600
 the whole region that gives us context

15:17.600 --> 15:18.880
 for the events of 9 11.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.280
 Right, right.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.600
 So yeah, if we go back to that day

15:21.600 --> 15:23.880
 and the weeks that followed,

15:23.880 --> 15:26.480
 in my mind went to the community I knew in Tashkent,

15:28.040 --> 15:28.880
 which was interesting.

15:28.880 --> 15:29.800
 I mean, they were,

15:29.800 --> 15:33.080
 so Islam was the focal point of our conversation in the US

15:33.080 --> 15:34.040
 about 9 11, right?

15:34.040 --> 15:36.280
 Everyone to know what was the relationship

15:36.280 --> 15:39.840
 between the civic violence and that religious tradition

15:39.840 --> 15:44.840
 with its 1 billion plus followers across the globe, right?

15:45.160 --> 15:47.000
 That became the issue, of course,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.400
 for American security institutions,

15:49.400 --> 15:53.440
 for local state and police institutions, right?

15:53.440 --> 15:54.320
 I mean, it became the,

15:54.320 --> 15:55.560
 I think it was the question

15:55.560 --> 15:56.680
 that most Americans had on their mind.

15:56.680 --> 15:59.760
 So again, I didn't imagine myself as someone

15:59.760 --> 16:00.840
 who had all the answers, of course,

16:00.840 --> 16:02.520
 but given my background

16:02.520 --> 16:04.600
 and coming at this from Russian history,

16:04.600 --> 16:06.840
 coming at this from studying empire

16:06.840 --> 16:09.040
 and trying to think about the region broadly,

16:10.080 --> 16:12.840
 I was very alarmed at the way that the conversation went.

16:12.840 --> 16:13.880
 Can I ask you a question?

16:13.880 --> 16:18.880
 What was your feeling on that morning of 9 11?

16:19.120 --> 16:20.240
 Who did this?

16:20.240 --> 16:22.520
 Isn't that a natural feeling?

16:22.520 --> 16:25.640
 It's coupled with fear of what's next,

16:25.640 --> 16:27.160
 especially when you're in DC,

16:27.160 --> 16:28.680
 but also who is this?

16:28.680 --> 16:30.280
 Is this an accident?

16:30.280 --> 16:32.040
 Is this a deliberate terrorist attack?

16:32.040 --> 16:34.960
 Is this domestic?

16:34.960 --> 16:37.440
 What were your thoughts of the options

16:37.440 --> 16:41.040
 and the internal ranking given your expertise?

16:41.040 --> 16:44.040
 I suppose I was taken by the narrative

16:44.040 --> 16:46.400
 that this was international.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.920
 I mean, I'd also lived in New York

16:47.920 --> 16:50.760
 during one of the first bombings in 94

16:50.760 --> 16:52.240
 of the World Trade Center.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.920
 So it was clear to me that a radical community

16:53.920 --> 16:58.280
 had really fixed New York as part of their imagination of,

16:58.280 --> 17:03.200
 and I immediately thought it was a kind of blow

17:03.200 --> 17:04.320
 to American power.

17:04.320 --> 17:08.840
 And I was drawn by the symbolism of it.

17:08.840 --> 17:09.680
 If you think of it as an act,

17:09.680 --> 17:13.120
 it was a kind of an act of speech, if you will,

17:13.120 --> 17:16.840
 a kind of a way of speaking to,

17:16.840 --> 17:18.560
 from a position of relative weakness,

17:18.560 --> 17:21.440
 speaking to an imperial power.

17:21.440 --> 17:25.760
 And I saw it as a kind of symbolic speech act of that

17:25.760 --> 17:28.960
 with horrific real world consequences

17:28.960 --> 17:30.960
 for all those innocent victims,

17:30.960 --> 17:32.000
 for the firemen, for the police,

17:32.000 --> 17:34.560
 and just the horror of the moment.

17:35.600 --> 17:39.640
 So I did see it as transcending the United States,

17:39.640 --> 17:42.840
 but I did not see it as really having anything necessarily

17:42.840 --> 17:45.360
 to do fundamentally about Afghanistan

17:45.360 --> 17:48.000
 and the history of the region that I'd been studying

17:48.000 --> 17:49.760
 and the community people that I knew

17:49.760 --> 17:52.360
 who were not particularly religious.

17:52.360 --> 17:54.200
 The guys I hung out with actually wore me out

17:54.200 --> 17:56.120
 because they wanted to go out every night.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.880
 They wanted to party every night.

17:57.880 --> 17:58.720
 Drinking?

17:58.720 --> 17:59.560
 Yep.

17:59.560 --> 18:00.560
 We had discussions about alcohol.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.720
 I mean, Uzbekistan is famous for its, you know.

18:02.720 --> 18:03.560
 Drinking.

18:03.560 --> 18:04.400
 It's drinking.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.220
 You know, it's.

18:05.220 --> 18:06.060
 That's something to look forward to.

18:06.060 --> 18:08.360
 So I do want to travel to that part of the world.

18:08.360 --> 18:11.400
 When was the last time you were in that part of the world?

18:11.400 --> 18:12.680
 Early 2000s.

18:12.680 --> 18:14.840
 Well, in the mid 2000s, 2010s.

18:14.840 --> 18:16.880
 So wait, so by the way, what drinking?

18:16.880 --> 18:17.720
 Vodka?

18:17.720 --> 18:20.040
 What's the, what's the weapon of choice?

18:20.040 --> 18:25.040
 Uzbekistan has incorporated vodka as the choice.

18:26.240 --> 18:28.280
 And that, and it informs, you know, and it's,

18:28.280 --> 18:30.040
 but the fascinating thing, you know, as a student,

18:30.040 --> 18:32.520
 is what you're observing as a non Muslim.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.200
 You know, I'm a non Russian.

18:34.200 --> 18:38.840
 I'm, this is all, you know, culturally new to me.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.800
 And I'm, you know, a student of all that, right?

18:40.800 --> 18:42.520
 As a grad student doing my work there.

18:42.520 --> 18:45.280
 So you're like Jane Goodall of vodka and Russia.

18:45.280 --> 18:46.120
 That's right.

18:46.120 --> 18:46.940
 You're just observing.

18:46.940 --> 18:47.780
 That's right.

18:47.780 --> 18:48.620
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:48.620 --> 18:51.280
 You get the Samogon, the grass vodka.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.360
 You get, you know, I have,

18:53.360 --> 18:56.640
 I've had some long nights on the Kazakhstan frontier

18:56.640 --> 19:00.120
 that I'm not proud of, you know.

19:00.120 --> 19:01.520
 But you got to know the people

19:01.520 --> 19:03.000
 and some of them from, from, from.

19:03.000 --> 19:03.840
 Yeah, yeah.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.360
 But intellectually, so the thing, I mean,

19:05.360 --> 19:08.040
 the fascinating thing there was that, and just as a,

19:08.040 --> 19:09.920
 I mean, there's a whole, you know, I'm a historian, right?

19:09.920 --> 19:14.400
 But there, there are great contributions by, you know,

19:14.400 --> 19:15.880
 anthropologists and ethnographers who,

19:15.880 --> 19:16.920
 who've gone across the planet

19:16.920 --> 19:20.000
 and try to understand how Muslims understand the tradition

19:20.000 --> 19:21.600
 at different contexts.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.320
 So many Uzbeks will say, you know,

19:25.680 --> 19:27.200
 this is part of our national culture

19:27.200 --> 19:29.760
 to drink and eat as we please, right?

19:29.760 --> 19:31.620
 And yet I'm a very devout Muslim.

19:31.620 --> 19:33.960
 And so of course you can encounter

19:33.960 --> 19:37.400
 other Muslim communities who won't touch alcohol, right?

19:37.400 --> 19:40.120
 But it's become kind of, I think it's very much,

19:40.120 --> 19:42.360
 you know, Soviet culture left a deep impression

19:42.360 --> 19:43.200
 in each of these places.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.360
 And so there are ways of thinking,

19:45.360 --> 19:49.760
 ways of performing, ways of, you know, enjoying oneself

19:49.760 --> 19:53.320
 that are shared across Soviet and former Soviet space

19:53.320 --> 19:54.640
 to this day, right?

19:54.640 --> 19:57.800
 And you've written also about Muslims in the Soviet Union.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.120
 That's right.

19:59.120 --> 20:02.280
 There's an article that, there was a paywall,

20:02.280 --> 20:04.920
 so I couldn't read it and I really want to read it.

20:04.920 --> 20:09.920
 It's a Moscow in the mosque or something like that.

20:11.840 --> 20:15.000
 By the way, just another tangent on a tangent.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.280
 So I bought all your books.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.120
 I love them very much.

20:18.120 --> 20:21.560
 One of the reasons I bought them and read many parts

20:21.560 --> 20:24.320
 is because they're easy to buy.

20:24.320 --> 20:28.560
 Unlike articles, every single website has a paywall.

20:28.560 --> 20:32.720
 So it's very frustrating to read brilliant scholars

20:32.720 --> 20:33.700
 such as yourself.

20:35.280 --> 20:37.520
 I wish there was one fee I could pay everywhere.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.840
 I don't care what that fee is,

20:38.840 --> 20:41.200
 where it gives, allows me to read

20:41.200 --> 20:42.200
 some of your brilliant writing.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.040
 No, no, thank you, I hear you.

20:43.040 --> 20:46.480
 I think moving toward more kind of open source

20:47.360 --> 20:49.120
 formatting stuff I think is what a lot of journals

20:49.120 --> 20:51.760
 are thinking about now and I think it's definitely

20:51.760 --> 20:54.520
 for the kind of democratization of knowledge and scholarship

20:54.520 --> 20:55.940
 that's definitely an important thing

20:55.940 --> 20:56.900
 that we should all think about.

20:56.900 --> 21:01.200
 And I think we need to exert pressure on these publishers

21:01.200 --> 21:02.600
 to do that, so I appreciate that.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.840
 This is what I'm doing here.

21:03.840 --> 21:06.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, good, good, I appreciate it.

21:06.520 --> 21:11.520
 So your thought was Afghanistan is not going to be

21:11.520 --> 21:14.960
 to be the center, the source of where.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.960
 It's not the center of this and invading that country

21:16.960 --> 21:21.960
 isn't gonna fix the toxic milestone of politics

21:22.160 --> 21:25.200
 that produced 9 11, right?

21:25.200 --> 21:26.520
 I'm just thinking of some of the personalities,

21:26.520 --> 21:28.880
 just thinking about going back to the Tashkent story

21:28.880 --> 21:29.800
 which I'll end with.

21:29.800 --> 21:34.060
 I mean, just observing real Muslims doing things

21:34.060 --> 21:35.400
 and then asking questions about it

21:35.400 --> 21:39.000
 and trying to understand through their eyes

21:39.000 --> 21:40.920
 what the tradition means to them.

21:40.920 --> 21:43.680
 And then we had a very narrow conversation

21:43.680 --> 21:48.320
 about what Islam is that generated, immediately exploded

21:48.320 --> 21:50.120
 on the day of 9 11, right?

21:50.120 --> 21:53.800
 And then of course, I think the antipathy toward Islam

21:53.800 --> 21:58.800
 and Muslims was informed by racism, informed by xenophobia.

21:59.920 --> 22:03.000
 So it became a perfect storm I think of demonization

22:03.000 --> 22:06.180
 that didn't sit with what I knew about the tradition

22:06.180 --> 22:08.380
 and with actual people that I had known

22:08.380 --> 22:10.960
 because then going back to, I mean, there were other friends

22:10.960 --> 22:13.000
 and encounters and so on, but just thinking about Afghanistan

22:13.000 --> 22:15.360
 and Tashkent for a moment, I mean,

22:15.360 --> 22:18.360
 just thought about my friends who had been,

22:18.360 --> 22:20.600
 who had suffered a great deal in their short lives,

22:20.600 --> 22:24.680
 who had been cast aside from country to country,

22:24.680 --> 22:26.680
 but had found a place in Tashkent

22:26.680 --> 22:28.680
 with some relative stability.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.040
 And they wanted to go out every night

22:31.040 --> 22:33.480
 and they explained, one friend,

22:33.480 --> 22:34.840
 we talked about it with the alcohol and all that

22:34.840 --> 22:37.260
 and he didn't get crazy, but he was like,

22:37.260 --> 22:38.880
 you can drink, but just don't get drunk.

22:38.880 --> 22:41.340
 That's permissible within Islam, right?

22:42.720 --> 22:44.960
 And he was an ethnic Pashtun.

22:44.960 --> 22:46.680
 I think Uzbeks had a different view,

22:47.640 --> 22:49.840
 often the more vodka the better,

22:49.840 --> 22:51.840
 and it doesn't violate, as I understand Islam.

22:51.840 --> 22:54.080
 So even, it's kind of a silly example,

22:54.080 --> 22:56.160
 but it's just an illustration of the ways in which

22:56.160 --> 22:57.980
 different communities, different generations,

22:57.980 --> 23:01.520
 different people can come at this very complex rich tradition

23:01.520 --> 23:02.500
 in so many different ways.

23:02.500 --> 23:06.120
 So obviously, whatever kind of scholar you are,

23:06.120 --> 23:08.320
 or any kind of expert, whatever,

23:08.320 --> 23:10.880
 it's always disconcerting to see

23:10.880 --> 23:13.800
 your field of specialization be flattened, right?

23:13.800 --> 23:15.120
 And then be flattened and then be turned

23:15.120 --> 23:18.480
 to arguments for violence, right?

23:18.480 --> 23:22.280
 Mixed up with the natural human feelings of hate.

23:22.280 --> 23:23.120
 Yeah, that's right.

23:23.120 --> 23:25.480
 And depression. And hurt at that moment, and pain.

23:25.480 --> 23:28.080
 So, I mean, that day I vividly remember,

23:28.080 --> 23:32.800
 I sat with other PhD historians in different fields.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.740
 We, oddly enough, had lunch that day

23:35.740 --> 23:37.320
 and it kind of deserted Washington.

23:37.320 --> 23:39.760
 Some place was open when we went.

23:39.760 --> 23:40.600
 And we just thought, you know,

23:40.600 --> 23:42.480
 this is going to kind of open up

23:42.480 --> 23:45.800
 like a great mall of destruction.

23:45.800 --> 23:50.800
 And, you know, the American state is going to destroy

23:51.020 --> 23:53.800
 and it's going to destroy in this geography.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.560
 And I thought that was misplaced for lots of reasons.

23:56.560 --> 23:59.200
 And then I think if one, you know,

23:59.200 --> 24:02.560
 I'd been doing some research on Afghanistan then,

24:02.560 --> 24:03.640
 I was kind of shifting to the South

24:03.640 --> 24:08.000
 and I'd been looking at the Taliban from afar

24:08.000 --> 24:08.840
 for some years.

24:08.840 --> 24:11.800
 And, you know, I think it's clear now

24:11.800 --> 24:14.080
 that in retrospect there were opportunities

24:14.080 --> 24:16.560
 for alternative policies at that moment.

24:16.560 --> 24:20.880
 So what should the conversation have been like?

24:20.880 --> 24:23.560
 What should we have done differently?

24:23.560 --> 24:28.560
 Because, you know, from a perspective of the time,

24:28.560 --> 24:33.440
 the United States was invaded by a foreign force.

24:33.440 --> 24:35.080
 What is the proper response

24:35.080 --> 24:36.760
 or what is the proper conversation

24:36.760 --> 24:39.080
 about the proper response at the time, you think?

24:39.080 --> 24:41.300
 You know, I know my colleague at Stanford,

24:41.300 --> 24:44.600
 Condoleezza Rice would tell me this is above my pay grade.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.640
 And, you know, she makes a point in her classes

24:46.640 --> 24:50.240
 to talk about how difficult decision making is

24:50.240 --> 24:52.200
 under such intense pressure.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.900
 And I appreciate that.

24:53.900 --> 24:57.420
 You know, I am a historian who sits safely in my office.

24:57.420 --> 24:58.720
 I don't like battlefields.

24:58.720 --> 25:01.480
 I don't like taking risks.

25:01.480 --> 25:02.960
 So I can see all those limits.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.280
 You know, I'm not a military expert.

25:05.280 --> 25:07.200
 I've been accused of being a spy wherever I've gone

25:07.200 --> 25:08.040
 because of the way I look

25:08.040 --> 25:10.320
 and because of my nationality and so on, but I'm not a spy.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.760
 So I defer, you know, I respect the expertise

25:12.760 --> 25:13.720
 of all those communities.

25:13.720 --> 25:16.960
 But I think they acted out of ignorance.

25:16.960 --> 25:19.680
 They acted, I think, because, I mean, you think of the,

25:19.680 --> 25:22.840
 in a way there was a compensatory aspect

25:22.840 --> 25:23.840
 of this decision making.

25:23.840 --> 25:27.580
 I mean, the Bush administration failed.

25:27.580 --> 25:29.580
 This was an extraordinary failure, right?

25:29.580 --> 25:30.420
 So if we start.

25:30.420 --> 25:31.240
 In which way?

25:31.240 --> 25:32.080
 Can we break down the nation?

25:32.080 --> 25:32.920
 Of intelligence.

25:32.920 --> 25:33.760
 I mean, if they, you know,

25:33.760 --> 25:35.760
 if you follow the story of Richard Clarke.

25:36.840 --> 25:37.800
 Who's Richard Clarke?

25:37.800 --> 25:40.840
 He was a national security expert

25:40.840 --> 25:43.400
 who was tasked with following Al Qaeda,

25:43.400 --> 25:47.280
 who had produced a dossier under the Clinton administration

25:47.280 --> 25:50.720
 that he passed on to the George W. Bush administration.

25:50.720 --> 25:53.440
 And if you look at the work of Condoleezza Rice,

25:53.440 --> 25:56.760
 she wrote a very famous, I think, unpaywalled

25:56.760 --> 25:58.680
 foreign affairs article that you can read,

25:58.680 --> 26:02.840
 announcing the George W. Bush foreign policy kind of outlook.

26:02.840 --> 26:05.280
 And it was all about great powers.

26:05.280 --> 26:06.480
 It was about the rise of China.

26:06.480 --> 26:07.520
 It was about Russia.

26:07.520 --> 26:10.920
 I mean, there's definitely a kind of hangover

26:10.920 --> 26:15.920
 of those who missed having Russia as the boogeyman.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.660
 Who spoke, you know, the Clinton administration

26:17.660 --> 26:19.920
 repeated again and again the idea of making sure

26:19.920 --> 26:21.840
 the bear stayed in his cage.

26:22.860 --> 26:26.540
 Which is why the United States threw a lifeline

26:26.540 --> 26:31.120
 to the Central Asian states, hoping to have pipelines,

26:31.120 --> 26:34.580
 hoping to shore up their national sovereignty

26:34.580 --> 26:39.120
 as a way of containing Russia initially, but also Iran,

26:39.120 --> 26:42.160
 you know, which sits to the south and west.

26:42.160 --> 26:43.840
 And then peripherally looking down the road

26:43.840 --> 26:45.640
 to China to the east.

26:45.640 --> 26:50.200
 So the bear is what, like Russia?

26:50.200 --> 26:53.200
 Or is it kind of like some weird combination

26:53.200 --> 26:55.360
 of Russia, Iran, and China?

26:55.360 --> 27:00.240
 The bear is Russia and Russia is this thing.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.760
 I'm trying to characterize the imagination

27:01.760 --> 27:04.000
 of some of these national security figures.

27:04.920 --> 27:07.240
 This is an image formed in the Cold War.

27:07.240 --> 27:09.480
 I mean, it has deeper seeds in European

27:09.480 --> 27:12.160
 and Western intellectual thought that go back

27:12.160 --> 27:17.160
 at least to the 1850s and the reign of Tsar Nicholas I.

27:17.600 --> 27:21.140
 When we first get this language about the Russian Empire

27:21.140 --> 27:24.960
 as this kind of evil polity.

27:24.960 --> 27:28.080
 Obviously this was a kind of pillar of Reaganism.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.960
 But the Clinton folks kept that alive.

27:30.960 --> 27:34.040
 They wanted to make sure that American power

27:34.040 --> 27:36.080
 would be unmatched.

27:36.080 --> 27:39.400
 And they, being creatures of the Cold War themselves,

27:39.400 --> 27:42.860
 they looked to Russia as a recession power

27:42.860 --> 27:45.560
 well before Putin was even thought of.

27:45.560 --> 27:49.440
 Yeah, I mean, this is, you mentioned one deep,

27:49.440 --> 27:52.140
 profound historical piece in Rambo.

27:52.140 --> 27:55.640
 It's probably, this conflict has to do

27:55.640 --> 27:57.280
 with another Sylvester Stallone movie,

27:57.280 --> 28:00.520
 a Rocky IV, which is also historically accurate

28:00.520 --> 28:03.540
 and based on, it's basically a documentary.

28:03.540 --> 28:07.440
 So there is something about the American power,

28:07.440 --> 28:10.140
 even at the level of Condoleezza Rice,

28:10.140 --> 28:15.140
 these respected deep kind of leaders and thinkers

28:15.760 --> 28:17.560
 about history and the future,

28:17.560 --> 28:20.440
 where they like to have competition

28:20.440 --> 28:25.440
 with other superpowers and almost conjure up superpowers,

28:26.520 --> 28:31.280
 even when those countries don't maybe at the time

28:31.280 --> 28:33.520
 at least deserve the label of superpower.

28:33.520 --> 28:34.360
 That's right, great point.

28:34.360 --> 28:35.760
 Yeah, they're all some points.

28:35.760 --> 28:39.400
 So yeah, I mean, Russia was, I think many, many exports.

28:39.400 --> 28:42.420
 I mean, my mentor at Princeton, Stephen Cotkin,

28:43.320 --> 28:45.320
 was then writing great things about how,

28:46.280 --> 28:49.600
 if you look at Russia's economy, the scale of its GDP,

28:49.600 --> 28:52.240
 its capacity to actually act globally,

28:52.240 --> 28:54.160
 it's all quite limited.

28:54.160 --> 28:56.680
 But Condoleezza Rice and the people around her

28:58.360 --> 29:00.080
 came into power with George W. Bush,

29:00.080 --> 29:03.560
 thinking that the foreign policy challenges of her era

29:03.560 --> 29:06.480
 would be those of the past, right?

29:06.480 --> 29:08.120
 Richard Clark and others within the administration

29:08.120 --> 29:10.440
 warned that, in fact, there is this group

29:10.440 --> 29:12.940
 that has declared war against the United States

29:12.940 --> 29:14.760
 and they are coming for us.

29:14.760 --> 29:17.280
 The FBI had been following these people around

29:17.280 --> 29:18.120
 for many months.

29:18.120 --> 29:21.880
 So by the time George W. Bush comes to power,

29:21.880 --> 29:23.800
 lots of Al Qaeda activists are, well, not lots,

29:23.800 --> 29:26.120
 but perhaps a dozen or so,

29:26.120 --> 29:30.000
 are already training in the United States, right?

29:30.000 --> 29:31.800
 And what we knew immediately from the biographies

29:31.800 --> 29:34.400
 of some of the characters of the attackers of 9.11,

29:34.400 --> 29:37.120
 it was a hodgepodge of people from across the planet,

29:37.120 --> 29:39.320
 but most of them were Saudi, right?

29:39.320 --> 29:41.240
 And that was known very early on

29:41.240 --> 29:43.240
 or presumed very early on.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.520
 So again, if we go back to your big question

29:44.520 --> 29:47.080
 about the geography, why Afghanistan?

29:47.080 --> 29:48.240
 It didn't add up, right?

29:48.240 --> 29:51.240
 It seemed to me that Afghanistan was a kind of soft target.

29:51.240 --> 29:54.100
 It was a place to have explosions,

29:54.100 --> 29:58.360
 to seemingly recapture American supremacy.

29:58.360 --> 29:59.760
 And also, I think, you know, there was,

29:59.760 --> 30:02.660
 in many quarters, there was a deep urge for revenge.

30:02.660 --> 30:05.440
 And this was a place to have some casualties,

30:05.440 --> 30:07.480
 have some explosions.

30:07.480 --> 30:09.720
 And then I think, you know, restore the legitimacy

30:09.720 --> 30:11.340
 of the Bush administration

30:11.340 --> 30:14.060
 by showing that we are in charge, we will pay.

30:14.060 --> 30:17.480
 And I think that was a very old fashioned punitive dimension,

30:17.480 --> 30:19.280
 which rests upon the presumption

30:19.280 --> 30:21.600
 that if we intimidate these people,

30:21.600 --> 30:23.880
 they'll know not to try us again, right?

30:23.880 --> 30:25.680
 All these, I would suggest, are all misreadings

30:25.680 --> 30:28.360
 of an organization that was always global.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.680
 It had no real center.

30:29.680 --> 30:30.680
 I mean, it called itself the center.

30:30.680 --> 30:32.880
 That's one way to translate Al Qaeda.

30:32.880 --> 30:35.560
 But that center was really in the imagination.

30:36.840 --> 30:39.240
 Bin Laden bounced around from country to country.

30:40.120 --> 30:42.740
 And crucially, I think a dimension

30:42.740 --> 30:45.200
 that I don't claim to know anything new about,

30:45.200 --> 30:47.900
 but has endured as a kind of doubt,

30:47.900 --> 30:50.360
 is the role of Saudi Arabia and the fact that, you know,

30:50.360 --> 30:55.000
 the muscle in that operation of 9 11 was Saudi, right?

30:55.000 --> 30:57.480
 I mean, this was a Saudi operation with,

30:57.480 --> 31:00.400
 if one thinks, again, just on the basis of nationalities,

31:00.400 --> 31:04.440
 Saudis, you know, an Egyptian or two, a Lebanese guy.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.800
 And the Egyptian guy, you know,

31:06.800 --> 31:08.640
 had been studying in Germany.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.980
 He was an urban planner, right?

31:10.980 --> 31:12.360
 So if one thinks of the imagination of this,

31:12.360 --> 31:15.760
 I mean, in fact, if you look at the kind of typology

31:15.760 --> 31:19.440
 of the figures who have led this radical movement,

31:19.440 --> 31:22.000
 I mean, if you think of the global jihadists,

31:22.000 --> 31:25.480
 they are mostly not religious scholars, right?

31:25.480 --> 31:27.660
 Bin Laden was not a religious scholar.

31:27.660 --> 31:29.200
 His training was an engineer.

31:29.200 --> 31:30.160
 You know, some biographers claim

31:30.160 --> 31:32.640
 that he was a playboy for much of his youth.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.680
 But really, these ideas,

31:34.680 --> 31:37.600
 I think that's probably why they chose the Twin Towers.

31:37.600 --> 31:41.720
 I mean, this is an imagination fueled

31:41.720 --> 31:43.880
 by training and engineering.

31:43.880 --> 31:46.400
 I mean, a lot of the, you know, the sociology,

31:46.400 --> 31:47.560
 if you do a kind of post biography

31:47.560 --> 31:50.800
 of a lot of these leading jihadists,

31:50.800 --> 31:53.160
 their backgrounds are not in Islamic scholarship,

31:53.160 --> 31:54.560
 but actually in engineering

31:54.560 --> 31:57.160
 and kind of practical sciences and professions.

31:57.160 --> 31:59.260
 Medical doctors are among their ranks.

32:00.400 --> 32:03.040
 And so there's long been a tension between Islamic scholars

32:03.040 --> 32:05.360
 who devote their whole lives to study of texts

32:05.360 --> 32:08.000
 and commentary and interpretation.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.640
 And then what some scholars call kind of new intellectuals,

32:10.640 --> 32:12.400
 new Muslim authorities,

32:12.400 --> 32:16.080
 who actually have secular university educations,

32:16.080 --> 32:17.200
 often in the natural sciences

32:17.200 --> 32:19.220
 or engineering and technical fields,

32:19.220 --> 32:22.560
 who then bring that kind of mindset, if you will,

32:22.560 --> 32:26.760
 to what Muslim scholars called the religious sciences,

32:26.760 --> 32:30.600
 which are, you know, a field of kind of ambiguity

32:30.600 --> 32:33.940
 and of gradation and of subtlety and nuance,

32:33.940 --> 32:36.540
 and really of decades of training

32:36.540 --> 32:39.840
 before one becomes authoritative to speak about issues

32:39.840 --> 32:41.200
 like whether or not it's legitimate

32:41.200 --> 32:43.260
 to take someone else's life.

32:43.260 --> 32:47.420
 With the relation to Afghanistan, who was bin Laden?

32:47.420 --> 32:49.320
 Bin Laden was a visitor.

32:50.640 --> 32:52.700
 If you look at his whole life course,

32:53.800 --> 32:55.760
 part of it is an enigma still.

32:55.760 --> 32:59.880
 You know, he is from a Saudi elite family,

32:59.880 --> 33:03.920
 but a family that kind of has a Yemeni Arabian sea

33:03.920 --> 33:07.060
 kind of genealogy.

33:07.060 --> 33:10.240
 So the family has no relationship to Afghanistan,

33:10.240 --> 33:13.560
 past or present, except at some point in 1980s,

33:13.560 --> 33:16.960
 when he went like thousands of other young Saudis,

33:16.960 --> 33:20.720
 first to Pakistan, to places like Bashour on the border,

33:20.720 --> 33:24.720
 where they wanted to aid the jihad in some capacity.

33:25.760 --> 33:29.180
 And for the most part, the Arabs who went

33:29.180 --> 33:32.140
 opened up hospitals, some opened up schools.

33:32.140 --> 33:35.020
 The bin Laden family had long been

33:35.020 --> 33:37.320
 based in engineering construction.

33:37.320 --> 33:39.400
 So it's thought that he used some of those skills

33:39.400 --> 33:42.420
 and resources and connections to build things.

33:44.240 --> 33:48.240
 We have images of him firing a gun for show, right?

33:48.240 --> 33:50.600
 It's not clear that he ever actually fired a gun

33:50.600 --> 33:52.200
 in what we would call combat.

33:53.900 --> 33:55.480
 Again, I could be corrected by this.

33:55.480 --> 33:58.600
 And I think there are competing accounts of who he was.

33:58.600 --> 34:01.200
 So he's kind of a, I mean, many of these figures

34:01.200 --> 34:05.280
 who sit at the pinnacle of this world are fictive heroes

34:05.280 --> 34:08.400
 that people map their aspirations onto, right?

34:08.400 --> 34:10.400
 And so people like Mullah Omar,

34:10.400 --> 34:13.300
 who was then head of the Taliban,

34:13.300 --> 34:15.920
 was rarely seen in public.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.680
 The current head of the Taliban

34:17.680 --> 34:19.480
 is almost never seen in public.

34:19.480 --> 34:22.240
 I mean, there's a kind of studied era of mystery

34:22.240 --> 34:25.340
 that they've cultivated to make themselves available

34:25.340 --> 34:27.720
 for all kinds of fantasies, right?

34:27.720 --> 34:32.080
 Do you think he believed, so his religious beliefs,

34:33.720 --> 34:38.720
 do you think he believed some of the more extreme things

34:39.120 --> 34:42.320
 that enable him to commit terrorist acts?

34:42.320 --> 34:44.000
 Maybe put another way,

34:44.000 --> 34:46.960
 what makes a man want to become a terrorist?

34:46.960 --> 34:50.400
 And what aspect of bin Laden made him want to be a terrorist?

34:51.440 --> 34:52.520
 Great.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.120
 I mean, let me offer some observations.

34:54.120 --> 34:57.040
 I think there are others who know more about bin Laden

34:57.040 --> 34:59.600
 and have far more expertise in Al Qaeda.

34:59.600 --> 35:04.340
 So I'm coming at this in an adjacent way,

35:04.340 --> 35:06.520
 kind of from Afghanistan and from my historical training.

35:06.520 --> 35:10.820
 So this is my two cents, so bear with me.

35:10.820 --> 35:12.680
 I don't have the authoritative account for this.

35:12.680 --> 35:14.040
 Which in itself is fascinating

35:14.040 --> 35:16.960
 because you're a historian of Afghanistan,

35:16.960 --> 35:21.160
 and the fact that bin Laden isn't a huge part

35:21.160 --> 35:23.960
 of your focus of study just means

35:23.960 --> 35:28.680
 that bin Laden is not a key part of the history of Afghanistan

35:28.680 --> 35:31.000
 except that America made him a key part

35:31.000 --> 35:32.280
 of the history of Afghanistan.

35:32.280 --> 35:33.300
 I would endorse that.

35:33.300 --> 35:34.140
 Definitely, that's it.

35:34.140 --> 35:37.140
 I mean, you've put it in a very pithy, pithy way.

35:37.140 --> 35:40.480
 Yeah, so listen, so he was an engineer.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.520
 He was said to be a playboy

35:42.520 --> 35:45.280
 who spent a lot of cash from his family.

35:45.280 --> 35:48.240
 Like many young Saudis and from some other countries,

35:48.240 --> 35:50.560
 he was inspired by this idea

35:50.560 --> 35:52.760
 that there was jihad in Afghanistan.

35:52.760 --> 35:55.840
 It was gonna take down one of the two superpowers,

35:55.840 --> 35:57.200
 the Soviet Union,

35:57.200 --> 36:01.720
 who the Red Army did murder hundreds of thousands,

36:01.720 --> 36:05.680
 perhaps as many as 2 million Afghan civilians

36:05.680 --> 36:06.880
 during that conflict.

36:07.720 --> 36:12.720
 It's very plausible and very completely understandable

36:13.500 --> 36:16.660
 that many young people would see that cause

36:16.660 --> 36:21.660
 as the righteous, pious fighters for jihad

36:21.660 --> 36:23.820
 who call themselves mujahideen

36:23.820 --> 36:26.420
 are ready against this evil empire

36:26.420 --> 36:30.220
 of a godless Soviet empire that,

36:30.220 --> 36:31.060
 I mean, there's even confusion

36:31.060 --> 36:32.300
 about what the Soviets wanted.

36:32.300 --> 36:34.380
 Now we know much more about what the Kremlin wanted,

36:34.380 --> 36:36.220
 what Brezhnev wanted,

36:36.220 --> 36:37.540
 and how the Soviet elite thought about it

36:37.540 --> 36:39.180
 because we have many more of their records.

36:39.180 --> 36:42.700
 But from the outside, for Jimmy Carter and then for Reagan,

36:42.700 --> 36:47.700
 it looked like the Soviets were making a move on South Asia

36:47.860 --> 36:50.860
 because they wanted to get to the warm water ports,

36:50.860 --> 36:52.660
 which Russians always want supposedly, right?

36:52.660 --> 36:56.120
 And it was kind of a move to take over our oil

36:56.120 --> 36:58.780
 and to assert world domination, right?

36:58.780 --> 37:01.500
 So there are lots of ways in which this looked like

37:01.500 --> 37:03.300
 good versus evil in Congress.

37:03.300 --> 37:06.880
 It looked like kind of Vietnam again,

37:06.880 --> 37:08.920
 but this time this is our chance to get them.

37:08.920 --> 37:11.380
 And there are lots of great quotes,

37:11.380 --> 37:13.900
 I mean, disturbing, but really revealing quotes

37:13.900 --> 37:16.300
 that American policymakers made about

37:16.300 --> 37:18.980
 wanting to give the Soviets their Vietnam.

37:18.980 --> 37:23.320
 So the CIA funneled hundreds of millions of dollars

37:23.320 --> 37:25.660
 into this project to back the Mujahideen,

37:25.660 --> 37:27.580
 who Reagan called freedom fighters.

37:27.580 --> 37:29.460
 And so Bin Laden was part of that universe,

37:29.460 --> 37:30.300
 he's part of that,

37:30.300 --> 37:33.520
 he's swimming in the ocean of these Afghan Mujahideen

37:33.520 --> 37:36.740
 who out of size did 95% of the fighting,

37:36.740 --> 37:37.740
 they're the ones who died,

37:37.740 --> 37:40.500
 they're the ones who defeated the Red Army, right?

37:40.500 --> 37:43.100
 The Arabs who were there did a little fighting,

37:43.100 --> 37:45.740
 but a lot of it was for their purposes.

37:45.740 --> 37:47.100
 It was to get experience,

37:47.100 --> 37:50.300
 it was to kind of create their reputations

37:50.300 --> 37:52.660
 like Bin Laden began to force for himself

37:52.660 --> 37:55.260
 of being spoken for a global project.

37:55.260 --> 37:57.020
 Because by the late 80s,

37:57.020 --> 37:58.860
 when Bin Laden I think was more active

37:58.860 --> 38:02.840
 and began conspiring with people from other Arab countries,

38:02.840 --> 38:06.020
 the idea that Gorbachev came to power in 85,

38:06.020 --> 38:07.100
 he's like, let's get out of here,

38:07.100 --> 38:09.380
 this is draining the Soviet budget,

38:09.380 --> 38:10.460
 it's an embarrassment,

38:11.500 --> 38:13.220
 we didn't think about this properly,

38:13.220 --> 38:17.220
 let's focus on restoring the party

38:17.220 --> 38:19.300
 and strengthening the Soviet Union,

38:19.300 --> 38:20.900
 let's get out of this costly war,

38:20.900 --> 38:23.780
 it's a waste, it's not worth it,

38:23.780 --> 38:24.620
 where you don't lose anything

38:24.620 --> 38:26.860
 by getting out of Afghanistan.

38:26.860 --> 38:31.860
 And so their retreat was quite effective and successful

38:31.880 --> 38:33.100
 from the Soviet point of view, right?

38:33.100 --> 38:35.140
 It's not what we're seeing now.

38:35.140 --> 38:37.300
 What year was the retreat?

38:37.300 --> 38:38.840
 I mean, it began,

38:38.840 --> 38:41.900
 so Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985,

38:41.900 --> 38:44.540
 he was a generation younger than the other guys,

38:44.540 --> 38:46.300
 he was a critic of the system,

38:46.300 --> 38:47.140
 he didn't want to abolish it,

38:47.140 --> 38:48.580
 he wanted to reform it,

38:48.580 --> 38:51.360
 he was a true believer in Soviet socialism

38:51.360 --> 38:55.640
 and in the party as a monopolist, right?

38:56.740 --> 38:58.020
 But he was critical of the old guard

38:58.020 --> 39:00.900
 and recognized that the party had to change

39:00.900 --> 39:04.620
 and the whole system had to change to continue to compete.

39:04.620 --> 39:07.420
 And so Afghanistan was one element of this.

39:07.420 --> 39:11.420
 And so he pushed the Afghan elites

39:11.420 --> 39:14.320
 that Moscow was backing to basically say,

39:14.320 --> 39:16.340
 listen, we're gonna share power.

39:16.340 --> 39:19.660
 And so a figure named Najibullah,

39:19.660 --> 39:23.260
 who was a Soviet trained intelligence specialist

39:23.260 --> 39:26.420
 sitting in Kabul agreed.

39:26.420 --> 39:28.780
 And he said, we need to have a more kind of

39:28.780 --> 39:33.220
 pluralistic accommodations approach to our enemies

39:33.220 --> 39:36.260
 who are backed by the US mainly,

39:36.260 --> 39:39.180
 sitting in Pakistan, sitting in Iran,

39:39.180 --> 39:40.540
 backed by these Arabs to a degree,

39:40.540 --> 39:42.340
 getting money from Saudi.

39:42.340 --> 39:45.100
 And he said, let's draw some of them into the government

39:45.100 --> 39:48.420
 and basically have a kind of unity government

39:48.420 --> 39:50.820
 that would make some space to the opposition.

39:50.820 --> 39:53.340
 And for the most part, with US backing,

39:53.340 --> 39:56.020
 with Pakistani backing, with Iranian backing

39:56.020 --> 39:58.540
 and with Saudi backing, the opposition said, no,

39:58.540 --> 40:00.700
 we're not going to reconcile,

40:00.700 --> 40:02.700
 we're gonna push you off the cliff.

40:02.700 --> 40:06.660
 And so that story goes on from at least 1987,

40:06.660 --> 40:11.180
 the last Soviet Red Army troops leave early 1989,

40:11.180 --> 40:15.220
 but the Najibullah government holds on for three more years.

40:15.220 --> 40:17.700
 It is the, I mean, they're still getting some help

40:17.700 --> 40:18.740
 from the Soviet Union,

40:18.740 --> 40:21.660
 its enemies are still getting help from the US mainly.

40:21.660 --> 40:26.660
 And it's not till 1992 that they lose.

40:27.180 --> 40:29.540
 And then Mujahideen come to power,

40:29.540 --> 40:33.060
 they immediately, they're deeply fractured.

40:33.060 --> 40:35.900
 And that's where bin Laden is watching all of this unroll.

40:35.900 --> 40:36.740
 That's right.

40:36.740 --> 40:37.860
 And he's part of the mix, but he's also mobile.

40:37.860 --> 40:42.580
 So he at one point goes, is in Sudan.

40:42.580 --> 40:44.060
 He's moving from place to place.

40:44.060 --> 40:45.220
 His people are all over the world.

40:45.220 --> 40:48.180
 In fact, they, I mean, if you think of the,

40:48.180 --> 40:50.180
 once the Mujahideen take power,

40:50.180 --> 40:52.100
 they have difficulties with Arab fighters too.

40:52.100 --> 40:54.180
 And they don't want them coming in and messing

40:54.180 --> 40:57.140
 with Mujahideen regarding this as like,

40:57.140 --> 40:59.340
 this is an Afghan national state that we're gonna build.

40:59.340 --> 41:01.620
 It's gonna be Islamic, it's gonna be an Islamic state,

41:01.620 --> 41:03.740
 but you can't interfere with us.

41:03.740 --> 41:05.660
 And so there are always tensions.

41:05.660 --> 41:07.020
 And so the Arabs are always kind of,

41:07.020 --> 41:09.980
 I would say they were Arab fighters were always interlopers.

41:11.300 --> 41:13.860
 Yes, the Afghans are happy to take their money,

41:13.860 --> 41:17.460
 send patients to their hospitals, take their weapons,

41:17.460 --> 41:20.700
 but they were never gonna let this be like a Saudi

41:20.700 --> 41:22.720
 or Egyptian or whatever project.

41:23.740 --> 41:26.340
 But then many of those fighters went home,

41:26.340 --> 41:29.140
 they went back to Syria, they went back to Egypt.

41:29.140 --> 41:30.580
 Some wanted to go back to the Saudi Arabia,

41:30.580 --> 41:31.620
 but the Saudis were very careful.

41:31.620 --> 41:33.220
 I mean, the Saudis always used Afghanistan

41:33.220 --> 41:34.860
 as a kind of safety valve.

41:34.860 --> 41:37.180
 In fact, they had fundraisers on television,

41:37.180 --> 41:38.420
 they chartered jets.

41:38.420 --> 41:41.340
 They filled them with people to fly to Pakistan,

41:42.420 --> 41:44.340
 get out in the shower and say, go fight.

41:44.340 --> 41:47.380
 And it was one way that the monarchy, the Saudi monarchy,

41:48.980 --> 41:52.660
 very cleverly I think, created a kind of escape valve

41:52.660 --> 41:55.420
 for would be dissidents in Saudi Arabia, right?

41:55.420 --> 41:56.900
 Just send them abroad.

41:56.900 --> 41:59.140
 You wanna fight Jihad, go do that somewhere else.

41:59.140 --> 42:01.260
 Don't bother the kingdom.

42:01.260 --> 42:04.380
 But all this became dicier in the early 90s

42:04.380 --> 42:06.260
 when some of these guys came back home

42:06.260 --> 42:09.140
 and some of the scholars around them said,

42:09.140 --> 42:11.180
 we've defeated the Soviet Union, which is a huge, huge boost.

42:11.180 --> 42:12.780
 And I think part of the dynamic we see today

42:12.780 --> 42:17.340
 is that the Taliban victory is a renewed inspiration

42:17.340 --> 42:20.220
 for people who think, look, we beat the Soviets,

42:20.220 --> 42:21.940
 now we beat the Americans.

42:21.940 --> 42:24.580
 And so already watching the Soviet retreat

42:24.580 --> 42:26.900
 across this bridge, back into Uzbekistan,

42:26.900 --> 42:30.300
 if you see these dramatic images of the tanks moving,

42:30.300 --> 42:32.420
 a lot of people interpreted this as like,

42:32.420 --> 42:34.620
 we are going to change the world

42:34.620 --> 42:36.500
 and now we're training to the Americans.

42:36.500 --> 42:38.220
 And our local national governments

42:38.220 --> 42:39.780
 are backed by the Americans.

42:39.780 --> 42:42.020
 So let's start with those places

42:42.020 --> 42:44.780
 and then let's go strike the belly of the beast,

42:44.780 --> 42:47.300
 which is America, which is New York.

42:47.300 --> 42:48.140
 And going back to Bin Laden,

42:48.140 --> 42:50.100
 your question about what motivates him,

42:50.100 --> 42:52.500
 what motivated him, again,

42:52.500 --> 42:57.340
 he was not a rigorously trained Islamic scholar.

42:57.340 --> 43:00.580
 And that I think, when this comes up in our classes,

43:00.580 --> 43:01.980
 I think especially young people,

43:01.980 --> 43:03.140
 I mean, people who weren't even born on 9 11,

43:03.140 --> 43:05.460
 I mean, they're shocked, they see his appearance,

43:05.460 --> 43:10.460
 they see him pictured in front of a giant bookshelf

43:10.660 --> 43:13.500
 of Arabic books, he's got the Kalashnikov,

43:13.500 --> 43:14.700
 he's got what looks like

43:14.700 --> 43:16.980
 a religious scholars library behind him, right?

43:16.980 --> 43:19.620
 But if you look at his words,

43:19.620 --> 43:21.500
 I mean, one fascinating thing about just our politics

43:21.500 --> 43:22.700
 and just one thing that kind of sums all this up,

43:22.700 --> 43:25.180
 I mean, the fact that on 9 11,

43:25.180 --> 43:29.740
 we had to have a few people, a few experts,

43:29.740 --> 43:32.140
 people like Burnett Rubin, who was an Afghanistan expert.

43:32.140 --> 43:33.780
 So that was one way in which I think,

43:33.780 --> 43:35.220
 I'm not faulting him personally,

43:35.220 --> 43:37.500
 but it's just one way in which that relationship

43:37.500 --> 43:40.340
 appeared to be formed, right?

43:40.340 --> 43:42.620
 Of linking Afghanistan to that moment.

43:44.100 --> 43:47.380
 If one looks actually at what Bin Laden was saying and doing,

43:47.380 --> 43:49.340
 people like Richard Clarke were studying this,

43:49.340 --> 43:51.940
 there were Arab leaders, the Arab press was watching this

43:51.940 --> 43:54.020
 because he gave some of his first interviews

43:54.020 --> 43:57.060
 to a few Arab newspaper outlets.

43:57.060 --> 44:00.260
 But speaking of our American kind of monolingualism,

44:00.260 --> 44:01.980
 a lot of what he was saying wasn't known.

44:01.980 --> 44:04.820
 And so I think for several years,

44:04.820 --> 44:07.740
 people weren't reading what Bin Laden said.

44:07.740 --> 44:10.260
 I mean, experts are reading it in Arabic,

44:10.260 --> 44:13.740
 but there was great anxiety around translating his works.

44:13.740 --> 44:15.820
 So we have Mon conf, we have all this other stuff,

44:15.820 --> 44:18.220
 you can buy the collected works of Lenin, Stalin, Mao,

44:18.220 --> 44:20.460
 whatever you want in whatever language you want.

44:20.460 --> 44:22.420
 But Bin Laden was taboo for American publishing.

44:22.420 --> 44:25.540
 So it was only a Verso in the UK

44:25.540 --> 44:29.020
 that published a famous volume called

44:29.020 --> 44:30.940
 Messages to the World,

44:30.940 --> 44:33.820
 which was the first compendium of Bin Laden's writings.

44:33.820 --> 44:35.980
 So he has a Mein Kampf.

44:35.980 --> 44:38.140
 He has a type, does he have a thing?

44:38.140 --> 44:39.220
 I mean, it's a kind of collected works.

44:39.220 --> 44:41.860
 It's a collected works of his, yeah.

44:41.860 --> 44:46.820
 Well, like a blog, like a collection of articles versus.

44:46.820 --> 44:49.300
 Yeah, these are interviews, these are his missives,

44:49.300 --> 44:54.300
 his declarations, his decrees, right?

44:54.300 --> 44:58.060
 But I think just in terms of if we zoom out for a second

44:58.060 --> 45:00.580
 about American policy choices and so on,

45:00.580 --> 45:02.700
 the powers that be didn't trust us

45:02.700 --> 45:04.260
 to know what he was really about.

45:04.260 --> 45:05.100
 I put it that way.

45:05.100 --> 45:06.820
 And I don't say that in a conspiratorial sense.

45:06.820 --> 45:11.100
 I just think that it was a taboo.

45:11.100 --> 45:14.740
 I think people, there was a kind of consensus

45:14.740 --> 45:19.740
 that trust us, we know how to fight Al Qaeda

45:20.180 --> 45:21.340
 and you don't need to know what they're about

45:21.340 --> 45:22.500
 because they're crazy.

45:22.500 --> 45:24.540
 They're fanatics, they're fundamentalists.

45:24.540 --> 45:28.740
 They hate us, remember that language, us versus them.

45:28.740 --> 45:30.740
 But if you read Bin Laden, that's when it gets messy.

45:30.740 --> 45:34.220
 That's where the Bin Laden's argumentation

45:34.220 --> 45:37.140
 is not fundamentally about Islam.

45:37.140 --> 45:39.180
 And if you were sitting here with an Islamic scholar,

45:39.180 --> 45:43.140
 he would say, depending on which Islamic scholar,

45:43.140 --> 45:45.580
 they would tend to go through and dissect

45:45.580 --> 45:48.660
 and negate 99% of the arguments

45:48.660 --> 45:51.100
 that Bin Laden claimed was in Islam, right?

45:51.100 --> 45:53.340
 But what strikes me as an historian who's again,

45:53.340 --> 45:57.020
 looking at this adjacently, if you read Bin Laden,

45:57.020 --> 45:59.940
 I mean, the arguments that he make are,

45:59.940 --> 46:01.420
 first of all, they're sophisticated.

46:01.420 --> 46:06.420
 They reflect a mind that is about geopolitics.

46:07.820 --> 46:09.940
 He uses terms like imperialism.

46:09.940 --> 46:12.220
 He knows something about world history.

46:12.220 --> 46:14.300
 He knows something about geography.

46:14.300 --> 46:16.140
 So imperialism is the enemy for him

46:16.140 --> 46:17.900
 or what's the nature of the enemy?

46:17.900 --> 46:21.620
 It's an amalgam and like a good politician,

46:21.620 --> 46:23.380
 which is what I would call him,

46:23.380 --> 46:27.020
 he is adept at speaking in different ways

46:27.020 --> 46:28.060
 to different audiences.

46:28.060 --> 46:30.620
 So if you look at the context in which he speaks,

46:30.620 --> 46:33.020
 if you look at messages to the world,

46:33.020 --> 46:35.740
 if you look at his writings and you can zoom out now

46:35.740 --> 46:37.660
 and we now have compendia of the writings

46:37.660 --> 46:40.900
 of Al Qaeda more broadly, you can purchase these,

46:42.420 --> 46:45.340
 they're basically primary source collections.

46:45.340 --> 46:47.020
 We now have that for the Taliban.

46:47.020 --> 46:49.500
 I mean, what's fascinating about,

46:49.500 --> 46:52.220
 I think if you'd like this culture,

46:52.220 --> 46:55.740
 acknowledging it's very diverse internally

46:55.740 --> 46:58.860
 is that these people are representatives

46:58.860 --> 47:01.140
 of political movements who seek followers.

47:01.140 --> 47:05.420
 They speak, they often are very,

47:05.420 --> 47:08.460
 I'd say skilled at visual imagery.

47:08.460 --> 47:10.220
 And especially now, I mean, what's fascinating is that,

47:10.220 --> 47:12.900
 I mean, the Taliban used to shoot televisions.

47:12.900 --> 47:17.900
 They used to blow up VCR, videotapes.

47:19.420 --> 47:22.740
 They used to string audio and video cassettes

47:22.740 --> 47:25.860
 from trees and kind of ceremonial hangings, right?

47:25.860 --> 47:30.380
 That we're killing this nefarious, infidel technology

47:30.380 --> 47:32.260
 that is doing the work of Satan.

47:32.260 --> 47:34.540
 And yet today, and plus, I mean,

47:34.540 --> 47:35.740
 one of the keys to the Taliban success

47:35.740 --> 47:38.860
 is that they got really good at using media.

47:38.860 --> 47:42.180
 I mean, brilliant at using the written word,

47:42.180 --> 47:44.100
 the spoken word, music, actually.

47:45.100 --> 47:48.500
 And Hollywood, Hollywood is the gold standard.

47:48.500 --> 47:52.300
 And these guys have studied how to create drama,

47:52.300 --> 47:53.900
 how to speak to modern users.

47:53.900 --> 47:55.020
 I mean, Islamic State did this.

47:55.020 --> 47:57.580
 I mean, the role of media, new media.

47:57.580 --> 48:01.780
 I mean, I follow and I am followed by

48:01.780 --> 48:06.580
 senior Taliban leaders, which is bizarre on Twitter.

48:06.580 --> 48:07.620
 On Twitter?

48:07.620 --> 48:08.900
 I don't know why they care about me.

48:08.900 --> 48:10.500
 I'm nothing.

48:10.500 --> 48:12.820
 They follow you on Twitter.

48:12.820 --> 48:13.660
 I don't know why.

48:13.660 --> 48:14.500
 This is no joke.

48:14.500 --> 48:15.340
 This is no joke.

48:15.340 --> 48:17.260
 So they're part of our modern world

48:17.260 --> 48:18.420
 and it's how they talk and it's how they recruit.

48:18.420 --> 48:20.740
 And this is part of the, this is why they are.

48:20.740 --> 48:22.100
 So Ben Laden, if you read Ben Laden,

48:22.100 --> 48:24.300
 he speaks multiple languages, I would say.

48:24.300 --> 48:27.460
 It's environmentalism.

48:28.420 --> 48:31.500
 The West is bad because we destroyed the planet.

48:31.500 --> 48:34.540
 The West is bad because we abuse women.

48:34.540 --> 48:38.820
 So in class, especially female students

48:38.820 --> 48:40.180
 are very surprised to learn

48:40.180 --> 48:43.580
 and actually say this feminist argument is not,

48:45.500 --> 48:47.420
 we start with, this is a murder.

48:47.420 --> 48:49.140
 This is a person who has taken human life,

48:49.140 --> 48:51.380
 innocent life over and over again.

48:51.380 --> 48:56.020
 And he is aspirationally genocidal,

48:56.020 --> 48:57.620
 but let's try to understand what he's about.

48:57.620 --> 48:59.340
 So we walk through the texts, read them

48:59.340 --> 49:02.740
 and people are shocked to learn that

49:02.740 --> 49:05.820
 it's not just about quotations in the Quran

49:05.820 --> 49:08.300
 strung together in some irrational fashion.

49:08.300 --> 49:10.940
 He knows, I mean, at the core,

49:10.940 --> 49:12.980
 I'd say is the problem of human suffering.

49:12.980 --> 49:15.420
 And he has a geography of that, that is mostly Muslim,

49:15.420 --> 49:17.860
 but he talked about the suffering of Kashmir, right?

49:17.860 --> 49:19.580
 So if you have a student in your class,

49:19.580 --> 49:22.420
 who's from South Asia, who knows about Kashmir,

49:22.420 --> 49:25.940
 he or she will say, that's not entirely inaccurate.

49:26.980 --> 49:29.980
 The Indian state commits atrocities in Kashmir.

49:31.220 --> 49:33.340
 Pakistan is doing that too.

49:33.340 --> 49:35.100
 Palestine is an issue, right?

49:35.100 --> 49:37.940
 So you have in the American university setting,

49:37.940 --> 49:41.500
 people across the spectrum who get that,

49:41.500 --> 49:43.460
 Palestinians have had a raw deal.

49:43.460 --> 49:46.220
 And so it's a, victimhood is central

49:46.220 --> 49:50.140
 and it's Muslim victimhood, which is primary,

49:50.140 --> 49:52.380
 but as a number of scholars have written,

49:52.380 --> 49:55.420
 and I definitely think this is a framework

49:55.420 --> 49:56.260
 for what this is useful.

49:56.260 --> 49:58.500
 I mean, in this kind of vocabulary,

49:58.500 --> 50:00.180
 in this framing, this narrative,

50:01.380 --> 50:03.340
 today, in today's world,

50:03.340 --> 50:06.580
 if we think of today's world being post Cold War,

50:06.580 --> 50:11.100
 91 to the present, looking at the series of Gulf Wars

50:12.020 --> 50:12.940
 and seeing the visuals of that,

50:12.940 --> 50:14.700
 I think that the American public

50:14.700 --> 50:15.540
 has been shielded from some of this,

50:15.540 --> 50:20.060
 but if you look at just the carnage of the Iraqi army

50:20.940 --> 50:24.180
 that George H.W. Bush produced, right?

50:24.180 --> 50:26.500
 Or you think of the images of the suffering

50:26.500 --> 50:31.180
 of Iraqi children under George H.W. Bush's sanctions,

50:31.180 --> 50:33.420
 US British airstrikes,

50:33.420 --> 50:36.740
 then you have Madeleine Albright answer a question

50:36.740 --> 50:37.580
 on 16 Minutes saying,

50:37.580 --> 50:40.660
 do you think the deaths of half a million Iraqi kids

50:40.660 --> 50:41.820
 is worth it?

50:41.820 --> 50:44.620
 Is that justified to contain Saddam Hussein?

50:44.620 --> 50:47.860
 And she says on camera, yes, it's worth it to me.

50:47.860 --> 50:49.820
 If you put that all together,

50:49.820 --> 50:52.300
 I mean, American kids, and of course the American public,

50:52.300 --> 50:55.900
 they're not always aware of those facts of global history,

50:55.900 --> 50:57.180
 but these guys are,

50:57.180 --> 51:02.180
 and they very capably use these images, use these tropes,

51:02.180 --> 51:03.820
 and use facts.

51:03.820 --> 51:05.780
 I mean, some of these things are not deniable.

51:05.780 --> 51:07.980
 I mean, these estimates about the number

51:07.980 --> 51:10.740
 of Iraqi civilian children dead,

51:10.740 --> 51:12.100
 that came from, I think, the Lancet,

51:12.100 --> 51:13.980
 and it came from, those are estimates,

51:13.980 --> 51:18.420
 but looking at this from the point of view of Amman,

51:18.420 --> 51:22.380
 of Jaffa, of Nairobi,

51:22.380 --> 51:25.100
 you can just think around the planet,

51:25.100 --> 51:26.500
 and if you see yourself as the victim

51:26.500 --> 51:29.700
 of this great imperial power,

51:29.700 --> 51:31.020
 you can see why especially young men

51:31.020 --> 51:36.020
 would be drawn to a road of self sacrifice.

51:37.220 --> 51:41.820
 And the idea is that in killing others,

51:41.820 --> 51:46.820
 you are making them feel how you feel,

51:46.860 --> 51:49.180
 because they won't listen to your arguments reasonably,

51:49.180 --> 51:52.620
 because they won't recognize Palestinian suffering,

51:52.620 --> 51:54.380
 Bosnian suffering, right?

51:54.380 --> 51:55.860
 Chechen suffering.

51:55.860 --> 51:57.420
 You go across the planet, right?

51:57.420 --> 51:59.980
 Because they won't recognize our suffering,

51:59.980 --> 52:01.620
 we're gonna speak to you in the only language

52:01.620 --> 52:04.220
 that you understand, and that's violence.

52:04.220 --> 52:08.220
 And look at the violence of the post 1991 world, right?

52:08.220 --> 52:12.340
 In which American air power really becomes a global,

52:12.340 --> 52:15.600
 you know, kind of fact in the lives of so many people.

52:16.820 --> 52:19.340
 And then the big mistake after 9 11 among many,

52:19.340 --> 52:22.860
 I mean, fundamentally was taking the war on terror

52:22.860 --> 52:25.060
 to some 30 or 40 countries, right?

52:25.060 --> 52:28.180
 So that you have more and more of the globe

52:28.180 --> 52:30.820
 feel like they're under attack, right?

52:30.820 --> 52:33.540
 And the logic is essentially, it's really bin Laden,

52:33.540 --> 52:36.500
 it's not we're going to convert you

52:36.500 --> 52:38.820
 and turn you into Muslims and that's why we're doing this.

52:38.820 --> 52:42.100
 That appears, that claim does appear at times.

52:42.100 --> 52:45.140
 But if you look at any given bin Laden text,

52:45.140 --> 52:47.500
 I mean, there are 40 claims in each text.

52:47.500 --> 52:48.900
 I mean, it's kind of, it's dizzying,

52:48.900 --> 52:51.080
 but he's a modern politician,

52:51.080 --> 52:54.860
 he knows the language of social equality,

52:54.860 --> 52:56.820
 you know, there's a class dimension to it,

52:56.820 --> 52:58.660
 there is an environmental dimension to it,

52:58.660 --> 53:00.740
 there's a gender dimension to it.

53:00.740 --> 53:04.180
 And yes, there are chronic quotes sprinkled in.

53:04.180 --> 53:06.500
 And when he wants to speak that language,

53:06.500 --> 53:09.300
 he knew that, you know, he's not a scholar.

53:09.300 --> 53:13.420
 So he would often get a few recognized scholars to sign on.

53:13.420 --> 53:16.020
 So some of his decorations of Jihad

53:16.020 --> 53:19.000
 had his signature kind of sprinkled in

53:19.000 --> 53:20.500
 with like a dozen other signatures

53:20.500 --> 53:22.780
 from people who are somewhat known

53:22.780 --> 53:24.800
 or at least with titles, right?

53:24.800 --> 53:28.240
 So as a kind of intellectual exercise,

53:28.240 --> 53:29.080
 it's fascinating to see

53:29.080 --> 53:33.120
 that he is throwing everything at the wall in one level.

53:34.080 --> 53:35.760
 That's one way to see that it's a,

53:35.760 --> 53:39.860
 these are kind of testaments toward recruitment

53:39.860 --> 53:43.840
 of people who, yes, they're angry, yes, they're unhappy.

53:43.840 --> 53:44.680
 And this is what, you know,

53:44.680 --> 53:47.160
 I think for a broader public, it's hard to get,

53:47.160 --> 53:51.280
 you're like, well, bin Laden didn't suffer, he wasn't poor.

53:51.280 --> 53:55.120
 Like, yeah, I mean, Lenin, Pol Pot, I mean.

53:55.120 --> 53:57.160
 They're speaking to, they're empathetic

53:57.160 --> 53:58.560
 to the suffering, the landscape,

53:58.560 --> 53:59.860
 the full landscape of suffering.

53:59.860 --> 54:03.400
 It's interesting to think about suffering,

54:03.400 --> 54:06.900
 you know, America, the American public,

54:06.900 --> 54:08.900
 American politicians and leaders,

54:09.880 --> 54:13.080
 when they see what is good and evil,

54:13.080 --> 54:16.560
 they're often not empathetic to the suffering of others.

54:16.560 --> 54:21.560
 And what you're saying is bin Laden perhaps accurately

54:21.600 --> 54:24.860
 could speak to the ignorance of America,

54:24.860 --> 54:28.280
 maybe the Soviet Union, to the suffering of their people.

54:28.280 --> 54:29.120
 That's right.

54:29.120 --> 54:32.680
 And I mean, if you look at the speeches

54:32.680 --> 54:37.200
 and the ideas that are public of Hitler in the 1930s,

54:37.200 --> 54:42.200
 he spoke quite accurately to the injustice

54:42.640 --> 54:46.480
 and maybe the suffering of the German people.

54:46.480 --> 54:49.080
 I mean, charismatic politicians

54:49.080 --> 54:50.840
 are good at telling accurate stories.

54:50.840 --> 54:53.040
 It's not all fabricated,

54:53.040 --> 54:55.640
 but they emphasize certain aspects.

54:55.640 --> 54:58.400
 And then the problem part is the actions

54:58.400 --> 55:00.200
 you should take based on that.

55:01.480 --> 55:03.600
 So the narratives and the stories

55:03.600 --> 55:06.680
 may be grounded in historical accuracy.

55:06.680 --> 55:11.680
 The actions then cross the line, the ethical line.

55:11.800 --> 55:13.600
 I found that too, I mean, it's a,

55:13.600 --> 55:14.760
 again, if you pick up just one of these texts,

55:14.760 --> 55:15.980
 I mean, it's a kaleidoscope.

55:15.980 --> 55:18.480
 So the Hitler analogy is interesting

55:18.480 --> 55:21.200
 because it's Hitler spoke to,

55:21.200 --> 55:23.400
 he could speak to things like inflation, right?

55:23.400 --> 55:24.500
 Which really existed.

55:25.400 --> 55:29.920
 But he also appealed to the irrational emotions of Germans.

55:29.920 --> 55:34.920
 He sought out scapegoats, Jews, Roma, disabled people,

55:36.220 --> 55:38.120
 homosexuals and so on, right?

55:38.120 --> 55:40.120
 That's also there in bin Laden too.

55:40.120 --> 55:44.040
 I mean, the idea of an anti semitism,

55:44.040 --> 55:47.640
 the constant flagging of Zionists and crusaders,

55:47.640 --> 55:50.720
 it's a kind of shotgun approach to a search for followers.

55:50.720 --> 55:53.160
 But I also hasten to add that it's,

55:53.160 --> 55:55.640
 for all of the things that we could take off saying,

55:55.640 --> 55:58.360
 well, yes, Kashmiris have suffered,

55:58.360 --> 56:00.000
 Chechens have suffered and so on.

56:01.280 --> 56:04.320
 Bin Ladenism never became a mass movement.

56:04.320 --> 56:06.660
 I mean, it never really, I think the,

56:08.040 --> 56:09.760
 I mean, this is the encouraging thing, right?

56:09.760 --> 56:11.440
 About ideology.

56:11.440 --> 56:14.840
 I mean, I think the blood on his hands

56:14.840 --> 56:18.080
 always limited his appeal among Muslims and others.

56:19.560 --> 56:21.120
 But Bin Laden did have, I mean, he had a,

56:21.120 --> 56:23.400
 there's a great book by a great scholar

56:23.400 --> 56:26.760
 at UC San Diego, Jeremy Prestholt,

56:26.760 --> 56:29.120
 who read a great book about global icons

56:29.120 --> 56:34.120
 in which he has Bin Laden, he has Bob Marley,

56:35.640 --> 56:40.440
 he has Tupac, you know, he asked why,

56:40.440 --> 56:42.360
 you know, he's doing research in East Africa,

56:42.360 --> 56:46.240
 why did he see young kids wearing Bin Laden shirts?

56:46.240 --> 56:48.080
 They're also wearing like Tupac shirts.

56:48.080 --> 56:50.000
 They're wearing Bob Marley shirts.

56:50.000 --> 56:55.000
 And it's a way of looking at a kind of partial embrace

56:56.760 --> 57:00.100
 of some aspects of the rebelliousness

57:00.100 --> 57:02.540
 of some of these figures, some of the time,

57:02.540 --> 57:05.280
 by some people under certain conditions.

57:05.280 --> 57:06.500
 Well, the terrifying thing to me,

57:06.500 --> 57:08.760
 so yeah, there is a longing in the human heart

57:08.760 --> 57:13.240
 to belong to a group and a charismatic leader somehow,

57:14.120 --> 57:16.120
 especially when you're young,

57:16.120 --> 57:18.840
 just a catalyst for all of that.

57:18.840 --> 57:22.920
 I tend to think that perhaps it's actually hard

57:22.920 --> 57:26.760
 to be Hitler, so a leader so charismatic

57:26.760 --> 57:29.560
 that he can rally a nation to war.

57:29.560 --> 57:32.580
 And Bin Laden, perhaps we're lucky,

57:32.580 --> 57:35.560
 was not sufficiently charismatic.

57:35.560 --> 57:37.740
 I feel like if his writing was better,

57:37.740 --> 57:39.560
 if his speeches were better,

57:39.560 --> 57:41.660
 if his ideas were stronger,

57:42.840 --> 57:46.000
 better, it's like more viral,

57:46.000 --> 57:48.800
 and then there would be more people,

57:48.800 --> 57:52.560
 kind of young people uniting around him.

57:52.560 --> 57:56.200
 So in some sense, it's almost like accidents of history

57:56.200 --> 57:58.240
 of just how much charisma,

57:58.240 --> 58:01.360
 how much charisma a particular evil person has,

58:01.360 --> 58:03.240
 a person like Bin Laden.

58:03.240 --> 58:05.680
 I think it's fair, evil works, I think.

58:05.680 --> 58:07.400
 So you think Bin Laden is evil?

58:07.400 --> 58:08.240
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:08.240 --> 58:09.940
 I mean, he was a mass murderer.

58:11.120 --> 58:13.720
 I'm just saying that his ideas were,

58:13.720 --> 58:17.680
 they're more complex than we've tended to acknowledge.

58:17.680 --> 58:21.960
 They have a wider potential resonance

58:21.960 --> 58:23.360
 than we would acknowledge.

58:23.360 --> 58:25.600
 I mean, and also, I guess what I'm,

58:25.600 --> 58:27.620
 just one fundamental point is that

58:29.560 --> 58:31.680
 thinking about the complexity of Bin Laden

58:31.680 --> 58:34.580
 is also a way of removing him from Islam.

58:35.560 --> 58:36.800
 He is not an Islamic thinker.

58:36.800 --> 58:39.680
 He is a cosmopolitan thinker

58:39.680 --> 58:43.240
 who plays in all kinds of modern ideologies,

58:43.240 --> 58:45.720
 which have proven to mobilize people in the past, right?

58:45.720 --> 58:50.720
 So antisemitism, populism, environmentalism,

58:51.880 --> 58:56.400
 and the urging to do something about humanity,

58:56.400 --> 58:57.800
 do something about suffering.

58:57.800 --> 58:59.120
 That's why I think the actual,

58:59.120 --> 59:00.320
 you asked about what motivates people

59:00.320 --> 59:01.140
 to do this kind of stuff.

59:01.140 --> 59:04.380
 I think that's why if one goes below the level of leadership,

59:04.380 --> 59:05.720
 and this is being reported,

59:05.720 --> 59:09.240
 if you look at the trial ongoing now in Paris

59:09.240 --> 59:12.860
 of the Bataclan murders, I think,

59:14.080 --> 59:15.600
 the court allowed some discussion

59:15.600 --> 59:17.640
 of the backgrounds of the accused,

59:17.640 --> 59:20.360
 and they come from different backgrounds,

59:20.360 --> 59:22.040
 but if there's any common bond,

59:22.040 --> 59:26.160
 it's kind of that they had some background in petty crime.

59:26.160 --> 59:28.300
 Famously, in the 7.7 bombings in London,

59:29.260 --> 59:32.560
 the Metropolitan Police, UK authorities

59:32.560 --> 59:34.520
 looked at all those guys,

59:34.520 --> 59:36.940
 and what people want is this idea

59:36.940 --> 59:39.100
 that they must be very pious.

59:39.100 --> 59:42.040
 They must be super Islamic to do this kind of stuff.

59:42.040 --> 59:43.560
 They must be fanatical true believers,

59:43.560 --> 59:45.360
 but what they found with those guys

59:45.360 --> 59:50.020
 was that some were nominally Muslim,

59:50.020 --> 59:51.720
 some went to mosques, some didn't.

59:53.320 --> 59:57.640
 Some were single, young guys with criminal backgrounds.

59:57.640 --> 1:00:01.880
 Some were like, sorry, they were kind of misfits

1:00:01.880 --> 1:00:04.400
 who never succeeded in anything.

1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:06.480
 But others had at least one thing,

1:00:06.480 --> 1:00:10.480
 had a wife and family who he widowed and orphaned.

1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:12.840
 And so there's no, I mean, for policing,

1:00:12.840 --> 1:00:15.160
 I mean, if you're looking at it through that lens,

1:00:15.160 --> 1:00:17.560
 there is no kind of typology

1:00:17.560 --> 1:00:20.120
 that will predict who will become violent.

1:00:20.120 --> 1:00:22.160
 And that's why I think we have to move beyond

1:00:22.160 --> 1:00:25.880
 thinking about religious augmentation narrowly or by itself

1:00:25.880 --> 1:00:27.280
 and think about things like geopolitics,

1:00:27.280 --> 1:00:30.220
 think about how people respond to inequality,

1:00:30.220 --> 1:00:35.220
 the existential threat of climate crisis,

1:00:35.980 --> 1:00:38.180
 of a whole host of matters,

1:00:38.180 --> 1:00:42.080
 and think about this is a mode of political contestation.

1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:43.560
 I mean, it's a violent one, it's one I condemn.

1:00:43.560 --> 1:00:45.200
 It is evil, right?

1:00:45.200 --> 1:00:47.760
 But these are people that are trying to be political.

1:00:47.760 --> 1:00:49.800
 They're trying to change things in some way.

1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:51.460
 It's not narrowly about like,

1:00:51.460 --> 1:00:54.220
 I don't know, impose Sharia law on you.

1:00:54.220 --> 1:00:55.940
 You must wear a veil.

1:00:55.940 --> 1:00:57.220
 You must eat this kind of food.

1:00:57.220 --> 1:00:59.340
 It's not that parochial.

1:00:59.340 --> 1:01:00.980
 But another quick thought

1:01:00.980 --> 1:01:03.380
 about your interesting claim about charisma in this,

1:01:03.380 --> 1:01:06.820
 I think that the one self limiting feature

1:01:06.820 --> 1:01:11.140
 of this subculture is that definitely,

1:01:11.140 --> 1:01:13.940
 I mentioned the enigma of not wanting to be seen

1:01:13.940 --> 1:01:17.420
 and that the kind of invisibility

1:01:17.420 --> 1:01:19.740
 is a productive force of a power,

1:01:20.700 --> 1:01:22.420
 which a colleague of mine

1:01:22.420 --> 1:01:24.860
 who knows ancient history far better than I,

1:01:24.860 --> 1:01:29.420
 said that this is, when she looked at Milo Omar initially,

1:01:29.420 --> 1:01:30.460
 or we talk about Bin Laden,

1:01:30.460 --> 1:01:33.580
 I mean, this kind of studied posture

1:01:33.580 --> 1:01:34.860
 of staying in the shadows

1:01:36.020 --> 1:01:37.980
 is also a source of authority potentially,

1:01:37.980 --> 1:01:41.140
 because it invites the idea,

1:01:41.140 --> 1:01:42.780
 and it's partly dictatorships do as well.

1:01:42.780 --> 1:01:45.780
 I mean, it invites the idea that someone's working,

1:01:45.780 --> 1:01:47.820
 and maybe it's the basis for a lot of QAnon

1:01:47.820 --> 1:01:48.660
 or other conspiracy today,

1:01:48.660 --> 1:01:51.220
 that someone's working behind the scenes

1:01:51.220 --> 1:01:53.020
 and things are gonna go the right way.

1:01:53.020 --> 1:01:54.460
 You can't see it.

1:01:54.460 --> 1:01:57.940
 That's almost preferable because you can kind of feel it.

1:01:57.940 --> 1:02:01.140
 And so not having someone out front

1:02:01.140 --> 1:02:02.740
 can be maybe more effective

1:02:02.740 --> 1:02:04.900
 than having someone out in front constantly.

1:02:04.900 --> 1:02:05.740
 Then the whole...

1:02:05.740 --> 1:02:06.580
 Maybe, maybe.

1:02:06.580 --> 1:02:07.420
 And then the whole Bin Laden,

1:02:07.420 --> 1:02:09.300
 you know, Milo Omar thing, like you can't see me,

1:02:09.300 --> 1:02:11.380
 or if you look at Bin Laden's photographs

1:02:11.380 --> 1:02:14.980
 and his video stuff, I mean, he's coy.

1:02:16.340 --> 1:02:18.860
 Some observers have noted that he's kind of effeminate.

1:02:18.860 --> 1:02:21.140
 He doesn't strike this kind of masculine,

1:02:21.140 --> 1:02:24.260
 he's not a Mussolini, he's not a Hitler,

1:02:24.260 --> 1:02:26.780
 macho, upstanding, thumping my chest.

1:02:26.780 --> 1:02:29.380
 He's not doing the theatrical chin, you know?

1:02:29.380 --> 1:02:32.780
 The theater people tell us he's so aggressive, you know?

1:02:32.780 --> 1:02:33.820
 Oh, a chin?

1:02:33.820 --> 1:02:35.540
 What, bringing your chin up?

1:02:35.540 --> 1:02:38.220
 I saw a great BBC theater person.

1:02:38.220 --> 1:02:39.420
 It was kind of a...

1:02:39.420 --> 1:02:42.300
 It was a makeover show about how to become a better...

1:02:42.300 --> 1:02:43.140
 A dictator?

1:02:43.140 --> 1:02:43.980
 Oh, no.

1:02:43.980 --> 1:02:47.740
 Just a powerful, yeah, leader, authoritarian figure.

1:02:47.740 --> 1:02:49.860
 No, just how to get ahead in life.

1:02:49.860 --> 1:02:50.700
 And then...

1:02:50.700 --> 1:02:51.540
 Oh, okay, cool.

1:02:51.540 --> 1:02:53.700
 And just about acting, how you can act differently, right?

1:02:53.700 --> 1:02:55.340
 So it was a BBC thing.

1:02:56.220 --> 1:02:59.660
 And this woman claimed that, you know,

1:02:59.660 --> 1:03:01.620
 sticking your chin out, like a wrestler does, right,

1:03:01.620 --> 1:03:03.020
 is the most, like, male to male.

1:03:03.020 --> 1:03:05.820
 I love this kind of hilarious analysis

1:03:05.820 --> 1:03:08.380
 that people have about power.

1:03:08.380 --> 1:03:09.660
 But watch the chin, watch the chin.

1:03:09.660 --> 1:03:11.740
 It's the same as analyzing, like,

1:03:11.740 --> 1:03:16.300
 in wrestling styles that win or fighting or so on.

1:03:16.300 --> 1:03:17.420
 There's so many ways to do it.

1:03:17.420 --> 1:03:19.420
 Well, the chin, I mean, the chin is a...

1:03:19.420 --> 1:03:21.620
 Could be interesting verbal gesture.

1:03:21.620 --> 1:03:25.900
 And I've watched enough Mussolini footage from my classes

1:03:25.900 --> 1:03:27.500
 to try to pick the right moment.

1:03:27.500 --> 1:03:28.380
 And the chin is...

1:03:28.380 --> 1:03:29.900
 Mussolini is all about the chin, so...

1:03:29.900 --> 1:03:33.540
 And I have watched human beings and human nature enough

1:03:33.540 --> 1:03:36.220
 to know that there's more to a man,

1:03:36.220 --> 1:03:38.060
 a powerful man, than a chin.

1:03:38.060 --> 1:03:38.900
 Yeah, no, no, no.

1:03:38.900 --> 1:03:40.340
 I'm saying it's an act of aggression.

1:03:40.340 --> 1:03:41.180
 I'm not saying it's...

1:03:41.180 --> 1:03:43.820
 It's one of the many tools in the toolkit.

1:03:43.820 --> 1:03:44.660
 Yeah, yeah, sure.

1:03:44.660 --> 1:03:45.500
 So she definitely...

1:03:45.500 --> 1:03:47.540
 It's not all about the chin, but it's a...

1:03:47.540 --> 1:03:49.500
 But that's what I'm trying to tell you about Ben Laden.

1:03:49.500 --> 1:03:52.500
 I don't think he was deliberate enough

1:03:52.500 --> 1:03:55.060
 with the way he presents himself.

1:03:55.060 --> 1:03:55.900
 What I'm saying about Ben Laden

1:03:55.900 --> 1:03:58.060
 that makes him different from these other characters is that

1:03:58.060 --> 1:04:01.460
 because he played at being the scholar,

1:04:01.460 --> 1:04:05.580
 he played at being a figure of modesty and humility.

1:04:05.580 --> 1:04:07.940
 And that meant that he was often...

1:04:07.940 --> 1:04:09.140
 Again, if you watch his visuals,

1:04:09.140 --> 1:04:11.780
 I mean, yes, there's one video of him firing a gun,

1:04:11.780 --> 1:04:14.220
 but if you watch how he moved,

1:04:14.220 --> 1:04:16.220
 how he wouldn't look at people directly,

1:04:16.220 --> 1:04:17.900
 how his face was almost...

1:04:17.900 --> 1:04:20.260
 I mean, he appears to be incredibly shy.

1:04:20.260 --> 1:04:22.180
 He's not spoken.

1:04:22.180 --> 1:04:23.860
 His voice was low.

1:04:23.860 --> 1:04:25.820
 He attempted to be poetic, right?

1:04:25.820 --> 1:04:28.500
 So it wasn't a warrior kind of image

1:04:28.500 --> 1:04:30.900
 that he tried to project of like a tough guy.

1:04:30.900 --> 1:04:34.620
 It was, I'm demure, I'm humble.

1:04:34.620 --> 1:04:37.140
 I'm offering you this message.

1:04:37.140 --> 1:04:41.580
 And the appeal that he was going for was to see...

1:04:43.660 --> 1:04:45.620
 To project himself as a scholar,

1:04:45.620 --> 1:04:48.340
 his knowledge and humility, the whole package,

1:04:48.340 --> 1:04:52.020
 carried with it an authenticity and a valor

1:04:52.020 --> 1:04:54.900
 that would animate, inspire people

1:04:54.900 --> 1:04:56.180
 to commit acts of violence, right?

1:04:56.180 --> 1:04:59.660
 So there's a different kind of logic of like go and kill.

1:04:59.660 --> 1:05:03.660
 So he presented himself in contrast

1:05:03.660 --> 1:05:08.660
 to the imperialist kind of macho power, superpowers.

1:05:09.780 --> 1:05:12.980
 So that's just yet another way of...

1:05:12.980 --> 1:05:14.820
 And you have to have facial hair or hair

1:05:14.820 --> 1:05:16.180
 of different kinds that's recognized.

1:05:16.180 --> 1:05:18.140
 We had a very recognizable look too,

1:05:18.140 --> 1:05:20.020
 or at least later in life.

1:05:20.020 --> 1:05:20.860
 So...

1:05:20.860 --> 1:05:22.860
 Yeah, no, he tried to look the part.

1:05:22.860 --> 1:05:23.980
 Yeah, yeah.

1:05:23.980 --> 1:05:25.900
 But I'm saying we're fortunate

1:05:25.900 --> 1:05:29.060
 that whatever calculation that he was making,

1:05:29.060 --> 1:05:33.660
 he was not more effective.

1:05:33.660 --> 1:05:38.220
 I mean, the world is full of terrorist organizations

1:05:38.220 --> 1:05:42.700
 and we're fortunate to the degree any one of them

1:05:42.700 --> 1:05:45.580
 does not have an incredibly charismatic leader

1:05:45.580 --> 1:05:49.380
 that attains the kind of power that's very difficult

1:05:49.380 --> 1:05:52.500
 to manage at the geopolitical level.

1:05:52.500 --> 1:05:55.260
 Yeah, and we credit the publics,

1:05:55.260 --> 1:05:57.140
 who don't buy into that, right?

1:05:57.140 --> 1:05:57.980
 Who see through this.

1:05:57.980 --> 1:06:00.140
 We credit the critics, you know?

1:06:01.300 --> 1:06:03.900
 Early on, Kermadev 9.11 itself,

1:06:05.340 --> 1:06:08.900
 one of the problems was that US government officials

1:06:08.900 --> 1:06:12.140
 kept kind of leaning on Muslims to condemn this

1:06:12.140 --> 1:06:16.260
 as if all Muslims shared some collective responsibility

1:06:16.260 --> 1:06:17.780
 or culpability.

1:06:17.780 --> 1:06:19.020
 And in fact,

1:06:20.860 --> 1:06:23.060
 dozens of scholars and organizations,

1:06:23.060 --> 1:06:25.100
 hundreds condemned this,

1:06:25.100 --> 1:06:27.140
 but their condemnations never quite made it out.

1:06:27.140 --> 1:06:29.900
 But it created a tension where, you know,

1:06:29.900 --> 1:06:32.420
 if you wore a veil, you must've been one of them

1:06:32.420 --> 1:06:33.980
 and you must be on Team Bin Laden.

1:06:33.980 --> 1:06:35.620
 And so a lot of the, you know,

1:06:35.620 --> 1:06:38.420
 I think a lot of the popular violence and discrimination

1:06:38.420 --> 1:06:40.740
 and profiling came out of that urge

1:06:40.740 --> 1:06:44.140
 to see a oneness, which, you know,

1:06:44.140 --> 1:06:45.420
 Bin Laden projected, right?

1:06:45.420 --> 1:06:47.580
 He wanted to say, we are one community.

1:06:47.580 --> 1:06:50.660
 You know, if you are a Muslim, you must be with me, right?

1:06:50.660 --> 1:06:53.980
 But I think that's where the diversity

1:06:53.980 --> 1:06:55.620
 of Muslim communities became important

1:06:55.620 --> 1:06:57.420
 because outside of small pockets,

1:06:57.420 --> 1:07:00.060
 I mean, they didn't accept his leadership, right?

1:07:00.060 --> 1:07:01.500
 People wore T shirts in some countries.

1:07:01.500 --> 1:07:02.420
 I mean, non Muslims wore T shirts

1:07:02.420 --> 1:07:03.980
 because he was like, he stuck it to the Americans.

1:07:03.980 --> 1:07:07.180
 So in Latin America, people are like,

1:07:07.180 --> 1:07:09.620
 yeah, that was sad, but, you know, finally,

1:07:09.620 --> 1:07:10.980
 I mean, there was a kind of schadenfreude

1:07:10.980 --> 1:07:11.820
 in that moment internationally.

1:07:11.820 --> 1:07:13.820
 It's like Che Guevara or somebody like that.

1:07:13.820 --> 1:07:16.140
 Yeah, Che's the other character in Prasad's book.

1:07:16.140 --> 1:07:17.740
 Yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right.

1:07:17.740 --> 1:07:18.700
 It's just a symbol.

1:07:18.700 --> 1:07:20.980
 It's not exactly what he believed

1:07:20.980 --> 1:07:23.260
 or the cruelty of actions he took.

1:07:23.260 --> 1:07:24.980
 It's more like he stood for an idea

1:07:24.980 --> 1:07:28.100
 of revolution versus authority.

1:07:28.100 --> 1:07:29.020
 That's right.

1:07:29.020 --> 1:07:32.780
 And that's a great way to understand Bin Ladenism

1:07:32.780 --> 1:07:33.620
 and the whole phenomenon,

1:07:33.620 --> 1:07:35.420
 but I think looking at the big picture,

1:07:35.420 --> 1:07:40.180
 it's also, you wonder, will that ever end, right?

1:07:40.180 --> 1:07:42.180
 I mean, is that, I mean, that's the risk

1:07:42.180 --> 1:07:45.140
 of being a kind of hyper power like the U.S.

1:07:45.140 --> 1:07:49.940
 where you, in assisting on a kind of unipolar world

1:07:49.940 --> 1:07:53.620
 in 2001, 2002, 2003, I think that created

1:07:55.260 --> 1:07:57.860
 an almost irresistible target, you know,

1:07:57.860 --> 1:08:00.700
 wherever the U.S. wanted to exert itself militarily.

1:08:00.700 --> 1:08:03.980
 Before we go to the history of Afghanistan,

1:08:03.980 --> 1:08:05.980
 the people, and I just want to talk to you

1:08:05.980 --> 1:08:10.580
 about just some fascinating aspect of the culture.

1:08:10.580 --> 1:08:12.140
 Let's go to the end.

1:08:13.060 --> 1:08:17.060
 Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.

1:08:18.100 --> 1:08:21.540
 What are your thoughts on how that was executed?

1:08:21.540 --> 1:08:24.460
 How could it have been done better?

1:08:24.460 --> 1:08:26.020
 Yeah, an important question.

1:08:26.020 --> 1:08:29.020
 I mean, I would preface all this by saying,

1:08:29.020 --> 1:08:31.860
 you know, as I noted, I think the war was a mistake.

1:08:31.860 --> 1:08:36.540
 I had hoped the war would end sooner.

1:08:36.540 --> 1:08:39.900
 I think there were different exit routes all along the way.

1:08:39.900 --> 1:08:43.420
 Again, I think there were lots of policy choices

1:08:43.420 --> 1:08:45.940
 in September and October when the war began.

1:08:46.980 --> 1:08:50.540
 There were choices in December 2001.

1:08:50.540 --> 1:08:54.060
 So we could look at almost every six month stopping point

1:08:54.060 --> 1:08:57.580
 and say, we could have done differently.

1:08:57.580 --> 1:09:00.700
 As it turns out though, I mean, the way it played out,

1:09:00.700 --> 1:09:02.380
 you know, it's been catastrophic.

1:09:02.380 --> 1:09:06.580
 And I think the Biden administration

1:09:08.300 --> 1:09:10.180
 has remained unaccountable for the scale

1:09:10.180 --> 1:09:14.340
 of the strategic and humanitarian and ethical failure

1:09:14.340 --> 1:09:15.980
 that they're responsible for.

1:09:15.980 --> 1:09:19.300
 Well, okay, let's lay out the full,

1:09:19.300 --> 1:09:24.060
 there's George W. Bush, there's Barack Obama,

1:09:24.060 --> 1:09:27.820
 there's Donald Trump, there's Biden.

1:09:27.820 --> 1:09:32.820
 So they're all driving this van and there's these exits

1:09:32.820 --> 1:09:34.500
 and they keep not taking the exits

1:09:34.500 --> 1:09:36.500
 and they're running out of gas.

1:09:36.500 --> 1:09:38.980
 I do this all the time thinking, where am I gonna pull off?

1:09:38.980 --> 1:09:41.220
 I'll go till it's empty.

1:09:41.220 --> 1:09:43.860
 How could it have been done better?

1:09:43.860 --> 1:09:48.740
 And what exactly, how much suffering

1:09:48.740 --> 1:09:52.380
 have all the decisions along the way caused?

1:09:52.380 --> 1:09:54.220
 What are the longterm consequences?

1:09:54.220 --> 1:09:56.360
 What are the biggest things that concern you

1:09:56.360 --> 1:10:00.620
 about the decisions we've made in both invading Afghanistan

1:10:00.620 --> 1:10:03.380
 and staying in Afghanistan as long as we have?

1:10:03.380 --> 1:10:05.960
 I mean, if we start at the end, as you proposed,

1:10:07.820 --> 1:10:09.580
 you know, the horrific scenes of the airport,

1:10:09.580 --> 1:10:11.660
 you know, that was just one dimension.

1:10:12.980 --> 1:10:14.420
 I think in the weeks to come,

1:10:15.860 --> 1:10:18.060
 I mean, we're gonna see Afghanistan implode.

1:10:19.540 --> 1:10:22.100
 There are lots of signs that malnutrition,

1:10:22.100 --> 1:10:26.980
 hunger, starvation are going to claim tens of thousands,

1:10:26.980 --> 1:10:29.520
 maybe hundreds of thousands of lives this winter.

1:10:29.520 --> 1:10:33.100
 And I think there is really nothing,

1:10:33.100 --> 1:10:38.100
 there's no framework in place to forestall that.

1:10:38.940 --> 1:10:42.900
 What is the government, what is currently the system there?

1:10:42.900 --> 1:10:44.740
 What's the role of the Taliban?

1:10:44.740 --> 1:10:46.620
 So there could be tens of thousands,

1:10:46.620 --> 1:10:48.420
 hundreds of thousands that starve,

1:10:48.420 --> 1:10:53.420
 either just almost to famine or starve to death.

1:10:54.380 --> 1:10:58.100
 So this is economic implosion, this is political implosion.

1:10:58.100 --> 1:11:01.540
 What's the system there like

1:11:01.540 --> 1:11:05.000
 and what could be the one, you know, some inkling of hope?

1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:05.840
 Right, right.

1:11:06.780 --> 1:11:09.380
 The Taliban sit in control, that's unique.

1:11:09.380 --> 1:11:14.380
 When they were in power in the 1990s from 1996, 2001,

1:11:14.380 --> 1:11:18.860
 they controlled some 85 to 90% of the country.

1:11:18.860 --> 1:11:22.380
 Now they own it all, but they have no budget.

1:11:22.380 --> 1:11:27.380
 The Afghan banking system is frozen.

1:11:28.780 --> 1:11:30.940
 So the financial system is a mess.

1:11:30.940 --> 1:11:32.340
 And it's frozen by the U.S.

1:11:32.340 --> 1:11:34.500
 because the U.S. is trying to use that lever

1:11:34.500 --> 1:11:36.940
 to exert pressure on the Taliban.

1:11:36.940 --> 1:11:40.540
 And so the ethical quandaries are of course legion, right?

1:11:40.540 --> 1:11:44.020
 Do you release that money to allow the Taliban

1:11:44.020 --> 1:11:46.740
 to shore up their rule, right?

1:11:46.740 --> 1:11:48.900
 The Biden administration has said no,

1:11:48.900 --> 1:11:51.380
 but the banks aren't working.

1:11:52.300 --> 1:11:56.660
 If you're in California, you wanna send $100 to your cousin

1:11:56.660 --> 1:11:59.980
 so she can buy bread, you can't do that now.

1:11:59.980 --> 1:12:01.360
 It's almost impossible.

1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:02.600
 There are some informal networks,

1:12:02.600 --> 1:12:06.140
 they're removing some stuff, but there are bread lines.

1:12:06.140 --> 1:12:09.300
 The Taliban government is incapable,

1:12:09.300 --> 1:12:10.720
 fundamentally just of ruling.

1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:13.620
 I mean, they can discipline people on the street,

1:12:13.620 --> 1:12:15.660
 they can force people into the mosque,

1:12:15.660 --> 1:12:18.780
 they can shoot people, they can beat protesters,

1:12:18.780 --> 1:12:20.740
 they can put out a newspaper,

1:12:20.740 --> 1:12:23.860
 they can have, they're great at diplomacy it turns out,

1:12:23.860 --> 1:12:24.860
 they can't rule this country.

1:12:24.860 --> 1:12:27.800
 So essentially the hospitals

1:12:27.800 --> 1:12:31.640
 and the kind of healthcare infrastructure

1:12:31.640 --> 1:12:36.640
 is being managed by NGOs that are international.

1:12:38.460 --> 1:12:41.180
 But most people had to leave

1:12:41.180 --> 1:12:44.740
 and the Taliban have impeded some of that work.

1:12:44.740 --> 1:12:47.980
 They've told adult women essentially to stay home, right?

1:12:47.980 --> 1:12:51.740
 So a big part of the workforce isn't there.

1:12:51.740 --> 1:12:56.740
 So the supply chain is kind of crawling to a halt.

1:12:57.200 --> 1:13:00.260
 Trade with Pakistan and its neighbors,

1:13:00.260 --> 1:13:02.600
 I mean, it's kind of a transit trade economy.

1:13:03.660 --> 1:13:05.540
 It exports fruits.

1:13:05.540 --> 1:13:07.460
 Pakistan has been closing the border

1:13:07.460 --> 1:13:09.060
 because they're anxious about refugees.

1:13:09.060 --> 1:13:12.020
 They want to exert pressure on the international community

1:13:12.020 --> 1:13:13.660
 to recognize the Taliban

1:13:13.660 --> 1:13:17.460
 because the Pakistan want the Taliban to succeed in power

1:13:17.460 --> 1:13:20.420
 because they see that in Pakistan's national interest,

1:13:20.420 --> 1:13:24.020
 especially through the lens of its rivalry with India.

1:13:24.020 --> 1:13:27.380
 So the Pakistani security institutions

1:13:27.380 --> 1:13:29.260
 are playing a double game.

1:13:29.260 --> 1:13:31.460
 Essentially Afghan people are being held hostage.

1:13:31.460 --> 1:13:34.280
 And so the Taliban are also saying,

1:13:34.280 --> 1:13:36.280
 if you don't recognize us,

1:13:36.280 --> 1:13:39.120
 you're gonna let tens of millions of Afghans starve.

1:13:39.120 --> 1:13:41.140
 So to which degree is Taliban,

1:13:41.140 --> 1:13:44.100
 like who are the Taliban?

1:13:44.100 --> 1:13:45.700
 What do they stand for?

1:13:45.700 --> 1:13:47.360
 What do they want?

1:13:47.360 --> 1:13:49.860
 Obviously year by year, this changes.

1:13:49.860 --> 1:13:53.600
 So what is the nature of this organization?

1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:57.820
 Can they be a legitimate, peaceful, kind, respectful

1:13:58.900 --> 1:14:02.320
 government sort of holder of power

1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:06.940
 or are they fundamentally not capable of doing so?

1:14:06.940 --> 1:14:08.140
 Yeah.

1:14:08.140 --> 1:14:09.900
 I mean, the briefest answer would be

1:14:09.900 --> 1:14:14.900
 that they are a clerical slash military organization.

1:14:17.300 --> 1:14:22.300
 They have, this is kind of a imperfect metaphor,

1:14:23.620 --> 1:14:28.180
 but years ago, a German scholar used the term caravan

1:14:28.180 --> 1:14:29.260
 to describe them.

1:14:29.260 --> 1:14:31.100
 And that has some attractive elements

1:14:31.100 --> 1:14:35.100
 because different people have joined the Taliban

1:14:35.100 --> 1:14:37.500
 for different purposes at different times,

1:14:37.500 --> 1:14:40.100
 but today, and people tell us,

1:14:40.100 --> 1:14:42.180
 scholars who know more about the women than I have said,

1:14:42.180 --> 1:14:45.220
 listen, the Taliban is this kind of hodgepodge

1:14:45.220 --> 1:14:48.300
 of different actors and people and competing interests.

1:14:48.300 --> 1:14:51.140
 And I think, so we have a lot of scholars who said,

1:14:51.140 --> 1:14:54.060
 listen, it's polycentric.

1:14:54.060 --> 1:14:57.300
 It's got people in this city and that city and so on.

1:14:57.300 --> 1:15:00.020
 I think actually, I was always very skeptical.

1:15:00.020 --> 1:15:00.940
 How do they know this?

1:15:00.940 --> 1:15:03.580
 I mean, this is an organization that doesn't want you

1:15:03.580 --> 1:15:06.820
 to know where that money comes from and so on.

1:15:06.820 --> 1:15:09.700
 But I would say now that we have a clear picture

1:15:09.700 --> 1:15:11.300
 of what has happened,

1:15:11.300 --> 1:15:15.220
 I'd say they are a astoundingly well organized

1:15:15.220 --> 1:15:20.220
 clerical military organization that has a very cohesive

1:15:22.300 --> 1:15:26.220
 and enduring ideology, which is quite idiosyncratic.

1:15:26.220 --> 1:15:28.180
 If we zoom out and continue the conversation

1:15:28.180 --> 1:15:30.600
 we're having about Islam and how we think about radicalism

1:15:30.600 --> 1:15:32.780
 and who's drawn to what,

1:15:34.620 --> 1:15:38.540
 people throw different terms around to describe the Taliban.

1:15:38.540 --> 1:15:43.060
 Some use a term that links it to a kind of school of thought

1:15:43.060 --> 1:15:45.900
 born in the 19th century in India, the Doabandi school.

1:15:47.400 --> 1:15:49.260
 But if you look at their teachings,

1:15:49.260 --> 1:15:51.540
 it's very clear now I think that these labels,

1:15:51.540 --> 1:15:54.140
 it's like saying, you're an MIT guy.

1:15:54.140 --> 1:15:54.980
 Well, what does that mean?

1:15:54.980 --> 1:15:59.340
 I mean, MIT is home to dozens of different potentially

1:15:59.340 --> 1:16:02.340
 kinds of intellectual orientations, right?

1:16:02.340 --> 1:16:03.860
 I mean, attaching the name of the school

1:16:03.860 --> 1:16:07.420
 doesn't quite capture, I mean, university.

1:16:07.420 --> 1:16:08.260
 It's complicated.

1:16:08.260 --> 1:16:09.500
 I mean, actually MIT is interesting

1:16:09.500 --> 1:16:11.340
 because I would say MIT is different

1:16:11.340 --> 1:16:13.000
 than Stanford, for example.

1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:16.500
 I think MIT has a more kind of narrow.

1:16:16.500 --> 1:16:18.020
 Yeah, I hear you.

1:16:18.020 --> 1:16:19.740
 Bad analogy on my part, maybe.

1:16:19.740 --> 1:16:21.740
 Well, no, it's interesting because I would argue

1:16:21.740 --> 1:16:26.740
 that there's some aspect of a brand like Taliban or MIT,

1:16:26.740 --> 1:16:31.740
 no relation, that has a kind of interact,

1:16:33.060 --> 1:16:37.100
 like the brand results in the behavior of the,

1:16:37.100 --> 1:16:39.260
 like enforces a kind of behavior on the people

1:16:39.260 --> 1:16:41.860
 and the people feed the brand and like there's a loop.

1:16:41.860 --> 1:16:43.780
 I think Stanford is a good example

1:16:43.780 --> 1:16:45.140
 of something that's more distributed.

1:16:45.140 --> 1:16:48.220
 There's sufficient amount of diversity

1:16:48.220 --> 1:16:50.020
 in like all kinds of like centers

1:16:50.020 --> 1:16:53.180
 and all that kind of stuff that the brand

1:16:53.180 --> 1:16:55.020
 doesn't become one thing.

1:16:55.020 --> 1:16:57.180
 MIT is so engineering.

1:16:57.180 --> 1:16:59.080
 It's so different than that.

1:16:59.080 --> 1:17:01.580
 Okay, scratch MIT, scratch Stanford too

1:17:01.580 --> 1:17:03.540
 because I think Stanford's more like MIT

1:17:03.540 --> 1:17:07.580
 than you might imagine, but isn't Taliban,

1:17:07.580 --> 1:17:10.640
 isn't it pretty, I don't think there's a diversity.

1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:13.200
 So yeah, sorry, so just to rephrase.

1:17:13.200 --> 1:17:15.100
 So people say, oh, the Deobandi school.

1:17:15.100 --> 1:17:16.340
 I'm like, what is that?

1:17:16.340 --> 1:17:20.460
 I mean, but the Taliban are, they're an ethnic movement.

1:17:20.460 --> 1:17:25.460
 They represent a vision of Pashtun power, right?

1:17:26.180 --> 1:17:29.980
 Pashtuns are people who are quite internally diverse,

1:17:29.980 --> 1:17:34.940
 who actually speak multiple dialects of Pashto,

1:17:34.940 --> 1:17:39.940
 who reside across the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan.

1:17:40.540 --> 1:17:42.820
 There are Pashtuns who live all over the planet, right?

1:17:42.820 --> 1:17:45.140
 There's a community in Moscow, California, everywhere,

1:17:45.140 --> 1:17:48.660
 right, so it's a global diaspora of sorts.

1:17:48.660 --> 1:17:51.140
 Pashtuns have a kind of genealogical imagination

1:17:51.140 --> 1:17:53.600
 so that lots of Pashtuns can tell you

1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:55.180
 the names of their grandparents, great grandparents

1:17:55.180 --> 1:17:56.420
 and so on, and that's kind of a,

1:17:56.420 --> 1:17:58.840
 there's a sense of pride in that.

1:17:58.840 --> 1:18:03.540
 Pashto language is a kind of core element of that identity,

1:18:03.540 --> 1:18:05.300
 but it's not universal.

1:18:05.300 --> 1:18:07.740
 So for example, you can meet people who say,

1:18:07.740 --> 1:18:10.660
 I am Pashtun, but I don't know Pashto.

1:18:10.660 --> 1:18:14.820
 So as you claw away at this idea, it's amorphous.

1:18:14.820 --> 1:18:15.940
 It also means different things,

1:18:15.940 --> 1:18:17.020
 different people at different times.

1:18:17.020 --> 1:18:20.700
 So saying the Taliban are Pashtun

1:18:20.700 --> 1:18:21.700
 requires lots of qualifiers

1:18:21.700 --> 1:18:24.020
 because lots of Pashtuns will say,

1:18:24.020 --> 1:18:26.480
 no, no, I have nothing to the Taliban.

1:18:26.480 --> 1:18:27.480
 I hate those people.

1:18:28.300 --> 1:18:32.680
 So the Taliban tried to mobilize other Pashtuns

1:18:32.680 --> 1:18:34.120
 with limited success,

1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:37.020
 but their core membership is almost exclusively Pashtun.

1:18:37.020 --> 1:18:40.180
 And they say, no, no, we represent Afghans.

1:18:40.180 --> 1:18:42.460
 We represent pious Muslims.

1:18:42.460 --> 1:18:46.020
 And so in recent two, three years,

1:18:46.020 --> 1:18:48.920
 they've gone further to say, no, we have other groups.

1:18:48.920 --> 1:18:52.660
 We have Uzbeks, we have Tajiks, we have Hazaras.

1:18:52.660 --> 1:18:54.640
 And in the North of Afghanistan, in recent years,

1:18:54.640 --> 1:18:57.300
 they did do a bit better at drawing in people

1:18:57.300 --> 1:18:59.800
 who were very disaffected because of the government.

1:18:59.800 --> 1:19:02.580
 And they were able to diversify their ranks somewhat.

1:19:02.580 --> 1:19:06.060
 But if you want to say August 15 and who they've appointed,

1:19:06.060 --> 1:19:07.440
 what language they've used,

1:19:07.440 --> 1:19:09.980
 how they've presented themselves,

1:19:09.980 --> 1:19:14.500
 it's clear that they are Pashtun, they are male,

1:19:14.500 --> 1:19:19.500
 and they are extremely ideologically cohesive

1:19:20.140 --> 1:19:22.820
 and disciplined, I'd say, right?

1:19:22.820 --> 1:19:25.860
 So I think that a lot of the polycentrism, blah, blah,

1:19:25.860 --> 1:19:27.980
 some of that stuff was a way to fight a war.

1:19:28.860 --> 1:19:33.020
 They are fundamentally a guerrilla movement.

1:19:33.020 --> 1:19:37.620
 They see themselves as kind of pious Robin Hoods.

1:19:37.620 --> 1:19:40.340
 The rhetoric is very much about taking from the rich,

1:19:40.340 --> 1:19:43.100
 taking from the privileged, giving to the poor,

1:19:43.100 --> 1:19:47.020
 being on the side of the underdog, fighting against evil.

1:19:47.020 --> 1:19:50.220
 And so, I mean, their bag, if you like, their thing,

1:19:50.220 --> 1:19:53.780
 their central theme, their brand is about public morality.

1:19:53.780 --> 1:19:55.940
 And so their origin story, going back to 1994,

1:19:55.940 --> 1:20:00.940
 is that they interceded, they broke up a gang of criminals

1:20:00.940 --> 1:20:03.300
 who were trying to rape people.

1:20:03.300 --> 1:20:08.140
 And so there's a very interesting emphasis on sexuality

1:20:08.140 --> 1:20:11.540
 and on public morality and really being the core

1:20:11.540 --> 1:20:16.100
 of we're gonna restore order and public morality.

1:20:16.100 --> 1:20:18.020
 And how that translates into governance

1:20:18.020 --> 1:20:19.300
 is something they've never sorted out.

1:20:19.300 --> 1:20:20.860
 I mean, how do you run a banking system

1:20:20.860 --> 1:20:23.660
 if your intellectual priorities are really about

1:20:23.660 --> 1:20:25.380
 the length of a beard?

1:20:25.380 --> 1:20:29.260
 And then their path to power in a kind of abstract sense,

1:20:29.260 --> 1:20:32.100
 I mean, a lot of that was very much driven by,

1:20:33.740 --> 1:20:37.300
 if you like, propagating the promise of martyrdom.

1:20:37.300 --> 1:20:38.820
 And that sounds, I don't mean to say that in a way

1:20:38.820 --> 1:20:40.740
 that, to make it sound ridiculous,

1:20:40.740 --> 1:20:44.380
 to make it sound like it's a moral judgment,

1:20:44.380 --> 1:20:46.980
 it's simply, I think, a fact, it's a fact of their appeal

1:20:46.980 --> 1:20:51.980
 that they promised young men who have known nothing else

1:20:52.420 --> 1:20:56.300
 but studying in certain schools, if at all,

1:20:56.300 --> 1:20:57.220
 but they've known fighting

1:20:57.220 --> 1:20:59.940
 and they've known victimization.

1:20:59.940 --> 1:21:03.180
 And this isn't, I'm not asking for sympathy for them,

1:21:03.180 --> 1:21:05.380
 but I think the reality is that a lot of the,

1:21:05.380 --> 1:21:06.980
 we know about the kind of foot soldiers

1:21:06.980 --> 1:21:10.860
 is that they lost families in bombings,

1:21:11.700 --> 1:21:13.660
 in airstrikes, in night raids.

1:21:15.300 --> 1:21:17.460
 I mean, orphans have always been a stream,

1:21:18.740 --> 1:21:23.180
 living in all male society, not knowing girls,

1:21:23.180 --> 1:21:25.820
 not knowing women, hearing things from outside

1:21:25.820 --> 1:21:27.420
 about places like Kabul.

1:21:27.420 --> 1:21:30.020
 And so there's always been this kind of urban rural

1:21:30.020 --> 1:21:32.100
 dimension, it's not just that,

1:21:32.100 --> 1:21:36.180
 but I think there's a whole imagination

1:21:36.180 --> 1:21:39.740
 that being Taliban captures.

1:21:39.740 --> 1:21:41.780
 And the whole margin of thing is really it's,

1:21:43.300 --> 1:21:45.060
 you know, I think to any religious person,

1:21:45.060 --> 1:21:46.860
 I mean, it's not a bizarre idea.

1:21:46.860 --> 1:21:50.740
 I mean, it animates, I mean, so many global traditions,

1:21:50.740 --> 1:21:52.660
 you know, but I think the,

1:21:52.660 --> 1:21:54.780
 but you try to tell like an army colonel,

1:21:54.780 --> 1:21:56.460
 if you were to have a conversation with,

1:21:56.460 --> 1:21:58.900
 you know, a US Marine about this,

1:21:58.900 --> 1:21:59.740
 I mean, some would get it

1:21:59.740 --> 1:22:01.300
 from their own religious backgrounds,

1:22:01.300 --> 1:22:04.260
 but I think it's an alien idea,

1:22:04.260 --> 1:22:06.300
 but I think it's essential to kind of stretch out

1:22:06.300 --> 1:22:08.580
 my imagination to understand that's attractive.

1:22:08.580 --> 1:22:09.860
 And now one of the dilemmas going forward

1:22:09.860 --> 1:22:14.180
 is that they've got to pivot from martyrdom.

1:22:14.180 --> 1:22:16.700
 And some have been, some have told foreign journalists,

1:22:16.700 --> 1:22:19.140
 I mean, it's good that we're in charge now,

1:22:19.140 --> 1:22:21.740
 we're gonna build a proper state,

1:22:21.740 --> 1:22:23.700
 but it's kind of boring.

1:22:24.540 --> 1:22:26.820
 I wanna keep fighting, maybe I'll do that in Pakistan.

1:22:26.820 --> 1:22:28.980
 Yeah, I mean, it's nice that they are expressing

1:22:28.980 --> 1:22:32.060
 that thought, some are not even honest sufficiently

1:22:32.060 --> 1:22:34.220
 with themselves to express that kind of thought.

1:22:34.220 --> 1:22:36.740
 If you're a fighter,

1:22:38.340 --> 1:22:40.900
 you see that with a bunch of fighters

1:22:40.900 --> 1:22:43.940
 or professional athletes, once they retire,

1:22:43.940 --> 1:22:47.180
 they don't know, it's very, it's boring.

1:22:47.180 --> 1:22:48.020
 Yeah, yeah.

1:22:48.020 --> 1:22:50.940
 And so like if the spirit of the Taliban,

1:22:51.820 --> 1:22:55.020
 even the best version of the Taliban is to fight,

1:22:55.020 --> 1:23:00.020
 is to be martyrs, is to paint the world as good and evil

1:23:00.300 --> 1:23:02.900
 and you're fighting evil and all that kind of stuff,

1:23:02.900 --> 1:23:04.620
 that's difficult to imagine how they can run

1:23:04.620 --> 1:23:07.540
 an education system, a banking system,

1:23:07.540 --> 1:23:12.020
 respect all kinds of citizens with different backgrounds

1:23:12.020 --> 1:23:16.580
 and religious beliefs and women and all that kind of stuff.

1:23:16.580 --> 1:23:18.460
 Yeah, and they've walked into Kabul

1:23:18.460 --> 1:23:22.060
 and other major cities, some of them are young,

1:23:22.060 --> 1:23:22.900
 they didn't know those places,

1:23:22.900 --> 1:23:26.940
 but also the very important obstacle for them

1:23:26.940 --> 1:23:28.900
 is that Afghan society has changed.

1:23:28.900 --> 1:23:31.500
 I mean, it's not what, even for the older guys,

1:23:31.500 --> 1:23:33.300
 it's not what they knew in the 1990s.

1:23:34.260 --> 1:23:37.500
 Some always had some ambivalence about the capital,

1:23:37.500 --> 1:23:38.500
 but now it's totally different.

1:23:38.500 --> 1:23:40.580
 I mean, they've been shocked to see, I think to me,

1:23:40.580 --> 1:23:43.620
 one of the most striking features of the last few weeks

1:23:43.620 --> 1:23:47.100
 has been that women have come out on the streets

1:23:47.100 --> 1:23:50.300
 and have stood in their faces and said,

1:23:50.300 --> 1:23:52.180
 we demand rights, we demand education,

1:23:52.180 --> 1:23:53.820
 we demand employment.

1:23:53.820 --> 1:23:57.900
 And these foot soldiers are paralyzed, they're not sure.

1:23:57.900 --> 1:23:59.780
 They don't know what to do with women, period.

1:23:59.780 --> 1:24:00.620
 Yeah, yeah.

1:24:00.620 --> 1:24:01.940
 And they don't know what to do with being yelled at

1:24:01.940 --> 1:24:04.260
 and having someone stick their fingers in their faces.

1:24:04.260 --> 1:24:07.700
 I mean, this is not what they've imagined.

1:24:07.700 --> 1:24:10.340
 And so I think, and at this juncture,

1:24:10.340 --> 1:24:12.460
 there are still foreign cameras around.

1:24:12.460 --> 1:24:16.300
 So they have committed acts of violence against women,

1:24:16.300 --> 1:24:18.580
 against journalists, they've beaten people,

1:24:18.580 --> 1:24:19.580
 they've disappeared people.

1:24:19.580 --> 1:24:22.100
 Even with cameras around, even in this tense period.

1:24:22.100 --> 1:24:24.860
 Yeah, but I think that when the cameras retreat

1:24:24.860 --> 1:24:26.340
 and that's not gonna happen,

1:24:26.340 --> 1:24:28.540
 it's gonna get much worse, I think.

1:24:28.540 --> 1:24:31.980
 So the challenge now is can the Taliban rule?

1:24:31.980 --> 1:24:35.100
 And then this is where the diplomacy is so important

1:24:35.100 --> 1:24:38.580
 because the Taliban can't rule in isolation

1:24:38.580 --> 1:24:39.500
 and they know that.

1:24:39.500 --> 1:24:41.740
 And part of the success is due to the fact

1:24:41.740 --> 1:24:45.500
 that they became very good at talking to other people

1:24:45.500 --> 1:24:48.220
 in the last, I mean, it's been building for the last decade,

1:24:48.220 --> 1:24:50.860
 but I'd say the last five years,

1:24:50.860 --> 1:24:52.300
 they always had Pakistan's backing.

1:24:52.300 --> 1:24:55.820
 And so the Taliban are, we noted they're a military force,

1:24:55.820 --> 1:24:57.260
 very effective guerrilla force.

1:24:57.260 --> 1:25:00.860
 They beat NATO, I mean, this is, still hasn't sunk in.

1:25:00.860 --> 1:25:04.300
 I mean, the fact that they, with light arms,

1:25:04.300 --> 1:25:08.620
 using suicide attacks, using mines,

1:25:08.620 --> 1:25:13.340
 improvised explosive devices, machine guns.

1:25:13.340 --> 1:25:17.100
 In some, in recent years, they got sniper rifles

1:25:17.100 --> 1:25:20.380
 and from the summer, they got American equipment

1:25:20.380 --> 1:25:22.340
 on a broad scale, right?

1:25:22.340 --> 1:25:23.420
 They have airplanes, they have a lot

1:25:23.420 --> 1:25:25.460
 that they will be able to use eventually.

1:25:25.460 --> 1:25:30.460
 So, but still, basically it's a story of AK47s,

1:25:30.660 --> 1:25:33.700
 some American small arms and mines.

1:25:33.700 --> 1:25:36.060
 So it's very Ho Chi Minh,

1:25:36.060 --> 1:25:38.140
 very old school guerrilla fighting, right?

1:25:38.140 --> 1:25:40.300
 And they defeated the most powerful military alliance

1:25:40.300 --> 1:25:41.380
 in world history probably.

1:25:41.380 --> 1:25:43.780
 So that has not yet sunk in and what that means

1:25:43.780 --> 1:25:45.940
 for American and global politics.

1:25:47.260 --> 1:25:49.380
 And now they're trying to rule, right?

1:25:49.380 --> 1:25:52.460
 They know they need international support

1:25:52.460 --> 1:25:56.100
 and their most consistent backer has been Pakistan

1:25:56.100 --> 1:25:59.980
 who sees them as an extension of Pakistani power.

1:26:01.180 --> 1:26:02.660
 And this is very important for a Pakistani elite

1:26:02.660 --> 1:26:05.300
 that of course is looking toward India.

1:26:05.300 --> 1:26:08.540
 They wanna have their rear covered, right?

1:26:08.540 --> 1:26:10.700
 They wanna make sure that these Pashtuns

1:26:10.700 --> 1:26:13.060
 don't cause trouble for Pakistan.

1:26:13.060 --> 1:26:15.380
 And they like, I mean, for some of the security forces,

1:26:15.380 --> 1:26:17.900
 they like this vision of the Islamic state

1:26:17.900 --> 1:26:19.540
 that the Taliban are building there

1:26:19.540 --> 1:26:22.060
 because those are not so distant from their views

1:26:22.060 --> 1:26:24.260
 of what Pakistan should be.

1:26:24.260 --> 1:26:27.180
 But the Taliban have been smart enough

1:26:27.180 --> 1:26:30.380
 to kind of diversify their potential international allies.

1:26:30.380 --> 1:26:32.540
 So everyone in the neighborhood

1:26:32.540 --> 1:26:34.820
 has wanted the US to leave, right?

1:26:34.820 --> 1:26:36.540
 If we go back to 2001,

1:26:36.540 --> 1:26:39.140
 there were Iranian and American special forces in the North

1:26:39.140 --> 1:26:41.660
 working together against the Taliban to displace them

1:26:41.660 --> 1:26:46.660
 using Iranian, American, and then Afghan resistance forces

1:26:47.460 --> 1:26:48.820
 against the Taliban.

1:26:48.820 --> 1:26:50.180
 And that was a real moment of rapprochement

1:26:50.180 --> 1:26:52.940
 if we go back to the missed exits.

1:26:54.580 --> 1:26:55.460
 The relationship with Iran

1:26:55.460 --> 1:26:57.220
 could have been different at that moment,

1:26:57.220 --> 1:27:01.260
 but the US under George W. Bush, you know,

1:27:01.260 --> 1:27:03.580
 devised this axis of evil language,

1:27:04.820 --> 1:27:06.300
 put them together with their enemy,

1:27:06.300 --> 1:27:10.180
 Iraq and the North Korea, all that went south.

1:27:10.180 --> 1:27:12.460
 That was the most opportunity.

1:27:12.460 --> 1:27:14.700
 But in recent years, the Taliban and Iran

1:27:14.700 --> 1:27:19.140
 have kind of papered over the differences.

1:27:19.140 --> 1:27:22.580
 They allowed the Taliban to open small offices

1:27:22.580 --> 1:27:24.460
 on Iranian territory,

1:27:24.460 --> 1:27:26.540
 likely shared some resources, some intelligence,

1:27:26.540 --> 1:27:28.500
 some sophisticated weaponry.

1:27:28.500 --> 1:27:30.660
 And then the Taliban went to Moscow.

1:27:30.660 --> 1:27:32.900
 And for the Putin administration,

1:27:32.900 --> 1:27:35.420
 you know, they've long been worried that,

1:27:35.420 --> 1:27:37.700
 you know, they see the Taliban as a kind of,

1:27:37.700 --> 1:27:40.620
 you know, disease that will potentially move North,

1:27:40.620 --> 1:27:43.180
 infect Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan,

1:27:43.180 --> 1:27:44.660
 Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan,

1:27:44.660 --> 1:27:47.980
 and maybe creep into Russia's sphere of influence.

1:27:47.980 --> 1:27:49.860
 Maybe that's why they have, you know,

1:27:51.060 --> 1:27:52.540
 a bunch of troops sitting in Tajikistan.

1:27:52.540 --> 1:27:54.460
 I mean, the one, you know,

1:27:54.460 --> 1:27:56.900
 Ford base that Russia as well has in Central Asia

1:27:56.900 --> 1:27:57.820
 is in Tajikistan.

1:27:58.780 --> 1:28:01.060
 And so the Taliban were always, you know,

1:28:01.060 --> 1:28:03.900
 a worrying point, but also useful because

1:28:03.900 --> 1:28:05.380
 they could say, well, you know,

1:28:06.700 --> 1:28:08.380
 in case the Taliban get out of control,

1:28:08.380 --> 1:28:09.900
 we need to be here.

1:28:09.900 --> 1:28:12.300
 And so Tajikistan said, okay, you know,

1:28:12.300 --> 1:28:14.100
 you're helping secure us.

1:28:14.100 --> 1:28:16.140
 And yes, it impinges upon our sovereignty,

1:28:16.140 --> 1:28:18.100
 but it's okay, you know?

1:28:18.100 --> 1:28:21.380
 So Putin said, you know, let's, you know,

1:28:21.380 --> 1:28:23.540
 give another black eye to the Americans

1:28:23.540 --> 1:28:25.380
 and let's, you know, treat the Taliban

1:28:25.380 --> 1:28:27.460
 as if they're the kind of government in waiting.

1:28:27.460 --> 1:28:30.180
 Let's have them come to Moscow multiple times.

1:28:30.180 --> 1:28:32.580
 This summer, you know, for the last year or two,

1:28:32.580 --> 1:28:34.300
 they've been talking to China, right?

1:28:34.300 --> 1:28:39.300
 So the photographs of senior Taliban figures

1:28:39.340 --> 1:28:40.740
 going from their office in Qatar,

1:28:40.740 --> 1:28:43.460
 which was a major blow to the U.S. back government,

1:28:43.460 --> 1:28:45.380
 the fact that they were able to open up

1:28:45.380 --> 1:28:47.100
 an office in Qatar that at one point

1:28:47.100 --> 1:28:51.340
 began to fly a flag of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,

1:28:51.340 --> 1:28:54.260
 that basically said, we're a state in the waiting.

1:28:54.260 --> 1:28:57.300
 And as the U.S.-backed Afghan government failed

1:28:57.300 --> 1:29:00.460
 and failed and failed at ruling too, right?

1:29:00.460 --> 1:29:02.500
 As they showed how corrupt they were.

1:29:02.500 --> 1:29:04.660
 And as they really alienated more and more Afghans

1:29:04.660 --> 1:29:07.340
 by committing acts of violence against them,

1:29:07.340 --> 1:29:11.020
 by stealing from them, by, you know,

1:29:11.020 --> 1:29:15.180
 basically creating a kind of kleptocracy, right?

1:29:17.100 --> 1:29:20.700
 The Taliban said, we are pure, we are not corrupt.

1:29:20.700 --> 1:29:22.660
 And look at us, we're winning on the battlefield.

1:29:22.660 --> 1:29:25.260
 And internationally, look, we're talking to China.

1:29:25.260 --> 1:29:27.980
 We're talking to Putin, we're talking to China.

1:29:27.980 --> 1:29:31.220
 We're a legitimate, powerful center of Central Asia.

1:29:31.220 --> 1:29:33.460
 And also kind of, you know, hinting that, you know,

1:29:33.460 --> 1:29:34.500
 oh, we have a website.

1:29:34.500 --> 1:29:36.180
 I mean, the whole digital angle is amazing

1:29:36.180 --> 1:29:39.380
 because they began to, and this is important, actually.

1:29:39.380 --> 1:29:43.380
 They had a website which grew more and more sophisticated.

1:29:43.380 --> 1:29:45.580
 Again, after having, you know, shot televisions

1:29:45.580 --> 1:29:47.580
 and these kind of ceremonial killings

1:29:47.580 --> 1:29:49.900
 of these infidel devices, right?

1:29:49.900 --> 1:29:53.540
 They said, we have a government, we have commissions,

1:29:53.540 --> 1:29:55.420
 we have a complaint line.

1:29:55.420 --> 1:29:57.980
 They lifted all this technocratic language

1:29:57.980 --> 1:30:00.100
 that you would get from any UN document,

1:30:00.100 --> 1:30:01.340
 you know, about good governance

1:30:01.340 --> 1:30:03.340
 and all the kind of, you know, generic language

1:30:03.340 --> 1:30:06.740
 that the NGO world has produced for us, right, in English.

1:30:06.740 --> 1:30:08.620
 They reproduced that in five languages

1:30:08.620 --> 1:30:10.460
 on their Taiwan website.

1:30:10.460 --> 1:30:12.300
 And of course, I'm not saying even believe this,

1:30:12.300 --> 1:30:15.620
 but it was like, you know, just put me in coach.

1:30:15.620 --> 1:30:17.300
 You know, I know the playbook.

1:30:17.300 --> 1:30:18.140
 I know how to run a government.

1:30:18.140 --> 1:30:20.700
 And look, we have an agricultural commission.

1:30:20.700 --> 1:30:24.220
 We have, you know, a taxation system.

1:30:24.220 --> 1:30:26.180
 And again, this idea, and then on the ground,

1:30:26.180 --> 1:30:28.340
 they had their own law courts.

1:30:28.340 --> 1:30:30.380
 And they would creep into a district,

1:30:30.380 --> 1:30:32.900
 assassinate some people, the local authority figures,

1:30:32.900 --> 1:30:36.380
 men of influence, talk to local clerics,

1:30:36.380 --> 1:30:39.740
 either get them on board or kill them and say, you know,

1:30:39.740 --> 1:30:42.220
 this state is corrupt, but we're bringing you justice.

1:30:42.220 --> 1:30:43.300
 This is our calling card.

1:30:43.300 --> 1:30:45.700
 We're bringing public reality and justice.

1:30:45.700 --> 1:30:48.980
 And then to a broader world, they said, you know,

1:30:48.980 --> 1:30:51.740
 yeah, things didn't go perfectly, the whole Al Qaeda thing,

1:30:51.740 --> 1:30:54.660
 you know, you know, wish we could have a do over on that.

1:30:56.060 --> 1:30:58.780
 We're not gonna let anyone hurt you from our territory.

1:30:58.780 --> 1:31:03.220
 We just wanna rule and people like us and look.

1:31:03.220 --> 1:31:05.140
 And so if you look at the neighborhood,

1:31:05.140 --> 1:31:08.340
 Iran, even the Central Asian states after a while,

1:31:08.340 --> 1:31:09.500
 recognizing they could make some money.

1:31:09.500 --> 1:31:11.420
 I mean, one of the, one thing that Uzbekistan likes

1:31:11.420 --> 1:31:13.940
 about the current arrangement, or they're not,

1:31:13.940 --> 1:31:17.460
 they're not hostile to is that they have all these contracts.

1:31:17.460 --> 1:31:21.180
 They can potentially make some money from, you know,

1:31:21.180 --> 1:31:25.020
 the pipeline dream remains alive, running natural gas, oil,

1:31:25.020 --> 1:31:28.020
 to, you know, which is the Indian ocean,

1:31:28.020 --> 1:31:31.380
 to markets, you know, beyond Central Asia.

1:31:31.380 --> 1:31:32.740
 It's sitting on a couple of trillion dollars,

1:31:32.740 --> 1:31:34.100
 probably in mineral resources

1:31:34.100 --> 1:31:36.500
 that China would love to have, of course.

1:31:36.500 --> 1:31:38.460
 And so people are looking at Afghanistan now,

1:31:38.460 --> 1:31:41.180
 after 20 years saying, you know, under American rule,

1:31:41.180 --> 1:31:42.700
 it was a basket case, right?

1:31:43.900 --> 1:31:46.620
 There was immense human suffering, incredibly violent.

1:31:46.620 --> 1:31:49.140
 The world did not start counting civilian casualties

1:31:49.140 --> 1:31:51.060
 in Afghanistan until 2009.

1:31:51.060 --> 1:31:51.900
 I mean, think about that.

1:31:51.900 --> 1:31:53.460
 The war went on for eight years.

1:31:53.460 --> 1:31:54.780
 The Taliban were never really defeated.

1:31:54.780 --> 1:31:56.100
 They just went to Pakistan.

1:31:56.100 --> 1:31:59.180
 They went to the mountains, they went to the woods.

1:31:59.180 --> 1:32:01.580
 And so all of these different American operations,

1:32:01.580 --> 1:32:05.420
 as you noted, under Bush, Obama, Trump, and so on,

1:32:07.460 --> 1:32:09.420
 killed countless civilians.

1:32:09.420 --> 1:32:10.580
 The US never accounted for that.

1:32:10.580 --> 1:32:12.220
 We never even counted.

1:32:13.260 --> 1:32:15.500
 Trump escalated civilian casualties

1:32:15.500 --> 1:32:17.260
 by escalating the air war.

1:32:17.260 --> 1:32:19.980
 But a lot of this was like very ugly, on the ground,

1:32:19.980 --> 1:32:21.260
 you know, night raid stuff,

1:32:21.260 --> 1:32:25.820
 where you drop into a Hamlet and massacre people,

1:32:25.820 --> 1:32:27.900
 and then you're not honest about what happened, right?

1:32:27.900 --> 1:32:31.620
 So that dynamic continued to fuel the growth of the Taliban

1:32:31.620 --> 1:32:32.700
 from below.

1:32:32.700 --> 1:32:35.100
 So the foot soldiers, they never ran out of foot soldiers.

1:32:35.100 --> 1:32:39.300
 I mean, the US and its allies killed tens of thousands,

1:32:39.300 --> 1:32:41.140
 maybe hundreds of thousands of Taliban fighters

1:32:41.140 --> 1:32:42.740
 over the last 20 years.

1:32:42.740 --> 1:32:44.860
 But they just sprouted up again.

1:32:44.860 --> 1:32:46.420
 And part of that was the kind of solidarity culture,

1:32:46.420 --> 1:32:51.020
 the male bonding of martyrology, of martyrdom,

1:32:51.020 --> 1:32:56.020
 and of revenge, and a sense of the foreign invader.

1:32:56.020 --> 1:32:57.860
 And I've heard, I mean, I haven't taught a ton

1:32:57.860 --> 1:33:01.540
 of US military people, but through the Hoover,

1:33:01.540 --> 1:33:03.540
 they put officers in our classes sometimes,

1:33:03.540 --> 1:33:07.220
 and met a few wonderful army and marine officers

1:33:07.220 --> 1:33:08.940
 who I really enjoyed.

1:33:08.940 --> 1:33:11.260
 You know, we came from the South like me,

1:33:11.260 --> 1:33:12.620
 always had great rapport with them,

1:33:12.620 --> 1:33:15.260
 and they expressed a range of opinions about this.

1:33:15.260 --> 1:33:17.460
 I think that I learned a lot from someone who said,

1:33:17.460 --> 1:33:20.020
 yeah, I mean, I get why they hate us.

1:33:20.020 --> 1:33:21.860
 I get why they're still fighting,

1:33:21.860 --> 1:33:25.820
 because last week, we were in the middle of a war,

1:33:25.820 --> 1:33:30.820
 we just killed 14 of their fellow villagers.

1:33:31.300 --> 1:33:34.780
 So the officers, the guys on the ground,

1:33:34.780 --> 1:33:37.300
 fighting this war, we're not stupid about that.

1:33:37.300 --> 1:33:39.500
 I mean, they got the human dimension of that,

1:33:39.500 --> 1:33:41.060
 and yet no one got off the exit,

1:33:41.060 --> 1:33:42.700
 as you said, people kept driving.

1:33:43.940 --> 1:33:46.380
 But going forward now, internationally,

1:33:46.380 --> 1:33:48.940
 it's critical that they have,

1:33:48.940 --> 1:33:50.460
 and they've had meetings.

1:33:50.460 --> 1:33:52.660
 I mean, what the Taliban have done since August 15th

1:33:52.660 --> 1:33:54.140
 is a lot of diplomacy.

1:33:54.140 --> 1:33:55.900
 They've had meetings, they've had people,

1:33:55.900 --> 1:33:58.500
 they've had Tashkent come, they've had Beijing come,

1:33:58.500 --> 1:34:00.300
 they've had Moscow come.

1:34:00.300 --> 1:34:04.780
 I mean, they've had major visits from Islamabad,

1:34:06.100 --> 1:34:09.260
 from security people, from diplomatic circles.

1:34:09.260 --> 1:34:11.940
 And they're counting on things being different this time.

1:34:11.940 --> 1:34:13.100
 I mean, the first time around,

1:34:13.100 --> 1:34:15.900
 the only people who backed the Taliban by recognition,

1:34:15.900 --> 1:34:17.620
 giving them diplomatic recognition,

1:34:17.620 --> 1:34:20.260
 were the Saudis, Pakistanis, and the UAE.

1:34:20.260 --> 1:34:24.420
 And because of Al Qaeda, because of opium,

1:34:24.420 --> 1:34:27.020
 because of some of the human rights stuff,

1:34:27.020 --> 1:34:28.420
 the US pushed everyone to like,

1:34:28.420 --> 1:34:30.020
 let's not recognize the state,

1:34:30.020 --> 1:34:31.260
 even though the US did.

1:34:31.260 --> 1:34:33.300
 I mean, Colin Powell famously,

1:34:33.300 --> 1:34:37.220
 summer of 2001, we did give a few grants and aid

1:34:38.940 --> 1:34:43.940
 to the Taliban as kind of like massaging negotiations.

1:34:44.420 --> 1:34:46.180
 They kept talking about bin Laden,

1:34:46.180 --> 1:34:49.420
 but they also wanted them to stop opium production.

1:34:49.420 --> 1:34:50.780
 I mean, Afghanistan, throughout all this period

1:34:50.780 --> 1:34:52.300
 we've talked about, is the global center

1:34:52.300 --> 1:34:54.220
 of opium production.

1:34:54.220 --> 1:34:57.460
 I mean, over the years, more and more of the Afghan economy

1:34:57.460 --> 1:35:00.460
 continued to today is devoted to the opium trade.

1:35:00.460 --> 1:35:05.460
 Opium, which is the thing that leads to heroin,

1:35:06.420 --> 1:35:07.780
 some of the painkillers.

1:35:07.780 --> 1:35:09.180
 Yeah.

1:35:09.180 --> 1:35:12.660
 And even if Afghan poppies don't make it to Hoboken,

1:35:13.540 --> 1:35:18.340
 they are not the source of American deaths.

1:35:18.340 --> 1:35:22.820
 They are part of a universal market, a global market,

1:35:22.820 --> 1:35:25.900
 which I think any economist would tell you

1:35:25.900 --> 1:35:29.660
 is part of the story of our opium problem.

1:35:29.660 --> 1:35:34.660
 Something I read maybe a decade ago now,

1:35:34.940 --> 1:35:36.460
 and I just kind of looked it up again

1:35:36.460 --> 1:35:38.380
 to bring it up to see your opinion on this,

1:35:38.380 --> 1:35:43.060
 is a 2010 report by the International Council

1:35:43.060 --> 1:35:45.380
 on Security and Development that showed

1:35:45.380 --> 1:35:50.380
 that 92% of Afghans in Helmand and Kandahar province

1:35:52.460 --> 1:35:56.900
 know nothing of the 9 11 attacks on US in 2001.

1:35:56.900 --> 1:36:00.500
 Is this at all representative of what you know?

1:36:00.500 --> 1:36:01.700
 Is this possible?

1:36:01.700 --> 1:36:03.860
 So basically, put another way,

1:36:05.140 --> 1:36:10.060
 is it possible that a lot of Afghans don't even know

1:36:10.060 --> 1:36:13.100
 the reason why there may be troops

1:36:13.100 --> 1:36:17.460
 or the sort of American provided narrative

1:36:17.460 --> 1:36:21.340
 for why there's troops, American soldiers,

1:36:21.340 --> 1:36:25.500
 and American drones overhead in Afghanistan?

1:36:25.500 --> 1:36:26.580
 Right.

1:36:26.580 --> 1:36:28.700
 I mean, my gut response,

1:36:28.700 --> 1:36:32.180
 not knowing the details of this actual poll is

1:36:32.180 --> 1:36:37.180
 that that's a very unhelpful way to think about

1:36:38.260 --> 1:36:39.940
 how Afghans relate to the world.

1:36:39.940 --> 1:36:43.580
 And I think it could be, if you go to my hometown,

1:36:44.780 --> 1:36:48.180
 in North Carolina, if you knock on some doors,

1:36:48.180 --> 1:36:50.740
 you may meet people who don't know all kinds of things.

1:36:50.740 --> 1:36:52.100
 I could probably walk around this neighborhood

1:36:52.100 --> 1:36:54.180
 here in California and there'd be all kinds of people

1:36:54.180 --> 1:36:56.700
 who don't know all kinds of things.

1:36:57.980 --> 1:37:01.460
 Kyrie Irving apparently thinks the earth is flat.

1:37:01.460 --> 1:37:06.460
 I mean, so we could make a lot of certain kinds

1:37:07.260 --> 1:37:08.100
 of ignorance, I think.

1:37:08.100 --> 1:37:09.980
 But I think what I would say,

1:37:09.980 --> 1:37:12.140
 and there's also, I mean, a companion point maybe

1:37:12.140 --> 1:37:15.140
 that in thinking about the withdrawal, the collapse,

1:37:15.140 --> 1:37:17.020
 the return of the Taliban,

1:37:17.020 --> 1:37:18.780
 there has been a big conversation

1:37:18.780 --> 1:37:21.780
 about what Afghans think of us really.

1:37:21.780 --> 1:37:24.300
 And this famous piece in the New Yorker

1:37:24.300 --> 1:37:28.740
 was about how many people liked the Taliban,

1:37:28.740 --> 1:37:33.740
 that many women interviewed supposedly in this piece,

1:37:35.460 --> 1:37:37.340
 were sympathetic because they had lost family members

1:37:37.340 --> 1:37:38.260
 and all the violence.

1:37:38.260 --> 1:37:40.340
 And the idea kind of was that,

1:37:41.420 --> 1:37:42.500
 we haven't thought about that at all.

1:37:42.500 --> 1:37:45.340
 When in fact, of course we have and lots of people have,

1:37:45.340 --> 1:37:48.300
 but I think if you're just dropping into the conversation,

1:37:48.300 --> 1:37:49.780
 if you look at like an immediate arc of coverage

1:37:49.780 --> 1:37:50.940
 of Afghanistan and the United States,

1:37:50.940 --> 1:37:55.500
 I mean, the arc went from lots of coverage during,

1:37:55.500 --> 1:37:57.780
 of course, 9.11 and its aftermath,

1:37:57.780 --> 1:38:00.860
 lots of coverage during Obama's surge,

1:38:00.860 --> 1:38:03.700
 and then quickly dropped down the last decade,

1:38:03.700 --> 1:38:05.220
 it's been almost nothing.

1:38:05.220 --> 1:38:07.380
 So if you ask the same question about Americans

1:38:07.380 --> 1:38:09.500
 or of Americans, I'm not sure what they would say to you,

1:38:09.500 --> 1:38:11.380
 what percentage would actually know

1:38:11.380 --> 1:38:14.340
 why the US is in X, Y, or Z either, right?

1:38:14.340 --> 1:38:16.220
 But on the Afghan side, just to return to that for a moment,

1:38:16.220 --> 1:38:19.540
 I think that we can fetishize these provinces.

1:38:19.540 --> 1:38:21.620
 They are kind of a place

1:38:21.620 --> 1:38:24.140
 where Taliban support has been greatest.

1:38:24.140 --> 1:38:25.620
 Also where there's been the most violence,

1:38:25.620 --> 1:38:27.300
 where the Americans have been most committed

1:38:27.300 --> 1:38:30.420
 to trying to root out the Taliban movement.

1:38:30.420 --> 1:38:32.380
 Where exactly in the South.

1:38:32.380 --> 1:38:34.500
 What are the other parts in the South of Afghanistan?

1:38:34.500 --> 1:38:37.060
 Yeah, it's mostly Pashtun, not exclusively,

1:38:37.060 --> 1:38:39.540
 but mostly Pashtun, mostly rural.

1:38:39.540 --> 1:38:40.420
 What is Pashtun?

1:38:40.420 --> 1:38:41.260
 That's the other group

1:38:41.260 --> 1:38:44.740
 that the Taliban claim to represent, right?

1:38:44.740 --> 1:38:45.580
 So they are this group.

1:38:45.580 --> 1:38:46.660
 What other groups are there?

1:38:46.660 --> 1:38:48.060
 Okay, sorry, yeah, sorry.

1:38:48.060 --> 1:38:51.020
 So in cities, you'll find everything, right?

1:38:51.020 --> 1:38:51.940
 That is in Afghanistan.

1:38:51.940 --> 1:38:54.780
 You'll find Uzbeks, Tajiks, Hazaras.

1:38:55.780 --> 1:39:00.780
 These are people who, Uzbek is a Turkic language, right?

1:39:01.140 --> 1:39:03.340
 Most Uzbeks live in what is now Uzbekistan,

1:39:03.340 --> 1:39:06.700
 but they form majorities in some Northern parts of the city.

1:39:06.700 --> 1:39:08.700
 I'm sorry, of the country of Afghanistan.

1:39:08.700 --> 1:39:10.340
 But what I emphasize is that,

1:39:11.620 --> 1:39:14.060
 and you can find online an ethnographic map of Afghanistan

1:39:14.060 --> 1:39:16.860
 and you'll see green where Pashtuns live,

1:39:16.860 --> 1:39:20.460
 red where Hazaras live, orange where Uzbeks live,

1:39:20.460 --> 1:39:22.460
 purple where Tajiks live.

1:39:22.460 --> 1:39:23.940
 Then there are a bunch of other smaller groups

1:39:23.940 --> 1:39:25.500
 of different kinds.

1:39:25.500 --> 1:39:30.500
 There are Noristanis, there are Baluch,

1:39:30.620 --> 1:39:32.620
 there are, in different religious communities,

1:39:32.620 --> 1:39:34.940
 there are Sunni, Shia, different kinds of Shia.

1:39:34.940 --> 1:39:36.660
 What are the key differences between them?

1:39:36.660 --> 1:39:39.940
 Is it religious basis from the origins

1:39:39.940 --> 1:39:43.380
 of where they immigrated from and how different are they?

1:39:43.380 --> 1:39:46.180
 So they're all, I mean, they're all indigenous, I think.

1:39:46.180 --> 1:39:47.260
 I mean, there's a kind of mythology

1:39:47.260 --> 1:39:49.540
 that some groups have been there longer, right?

1:39:49.540 --> 1:39:50.980
 So they have a greater claim to power.

1:39:50.980 --> 1:39:55.100
 But historically, I mean, it's like, you know,

1:39:55.100 --> 1:39:55.940
 ethnic groups anywhere,

1:39:55.940 --> 1:39:58.460
 people have different narratives about themselves,

1:39:58.460 --> 1:40:01.860
 but many Pashtuns would tell you, not all,

1:40:01.860 --> 1:40:03.340
 but many would say,

1:40:03.340 --> 1:40:05.780
 we are the kind of state builders of Afghanistan.

1:40:05.780 --> 1:40:09.620
 The dynasty that ruled much of the space,

1:40:09.620 --> 1:40:12.100
 that was born in the mid 18th century,

1:40:12.100 --> 1:40:15.380
 that ruled until 1973, more or less,

1:40:15.380 --> 1:40:18.420
 generalizing, you know, it was a Pashtun dynasty.

1:40:18.420 --> 1:40:21.820
 The Taliban have definitely said to some audiences,

1:40:21.820 --> 1:40:24.900
 we are the rightful rulers because we are Pashtun.

1:40:26.620 --> 1:40:28.580
 The trick though is, I don't mean to be evasive,

1:40:28.580 --> 1:40:30.700
 but just to convey some of the complexity,

1:40:30.700 --> 1:40:32.780
 one quick answer as well,

1:40:32.780 --> 1:40:34.420
 they're majorities and minorities.

1:40:34.420 --> 1:40:37.420
 I mean, one finds that a lot along with those maps,

1:40:37.420 --> 1:40:40.940
 but I would say suspend any firm belief in that

1:40:40.940 --> 1:40:42.980
 because that could be entirely wrong.

1:40:42.980 --> 1:40:47.100
 In fact, there's never been a modern census of Afghanistan.

1:40:47.100 --> 1:40:49.980
 So when journalists say Pashtuns are the majority,

1:40:49.980 --> 1:40:53.220
 or they're the biggest group, I would say not so fast.

1:40:53.220 --> 1:40:54.060
 I would say not so fast

1:40:54.060 --> 1:40:57.020
 because of migration is one major issue.

1:40:57.020 --> 1:41:00.060
 No major modern census.

1:41:00.060 --> 1:41:01.260
 Actually, the Soviets got pretty close,

1:41:01.260 --> 1:41:04.060
 but didn't quite, you know, find something comprehensive

1:41:04.060 --> 1:41:06.260
 and didn't publicize it knowing that it was,

1:41:07.380 --> 1:41:08.220
 you know, in modern times,

1:41:08.220 --> 1:41:11.060
 ethnicity can be the source of political mobilization.

1:41:11.060 --> 1:41:14.740
 It's not innately so, but it's been part of the story.

1:41:14.740 --> 1:41:16.020
 But then you have mixed families, right?

1:41:16.020 --> 1:41:17.740
 So a lot of people you'll meet,

1:41:17.740 --> 1:41:19.140
 you'll encounter in the diaspora and around,

1:41:19.140 --> 1:41:22.340
 I mean, well, I am, you know,

1:41:22.340 --> 1:41:26.220
 my one parent is Tajik, one is Pashtun, right?

1:41:26.220 --> 1:41:27.980
 Or I'm Pashtun, as I mentioned before,

1:41:27.980 --> 1:41:29.980
 but I don't speak Pashto, right?

1:41:29.980 --> 1:41:34.980
 Or I am Hazara, but you read about us as Shiite Hazara,

1:41:35.100 --> 1:41:36.900
 in fact, I'm a Sunni Hazara,

1:41:36.900 --> 1:41:39.380
 or I'm a secular Hazara, or I'm an atheist Hazara.

1:41:39.380 --> 1:41:41.940
 I mean, everything's possible, right?

1:41:41.940 --> 1:41:46.100
 One of my friends, if he were here,

1:41:46.100 --> 1:41:49.140
 he'd say, I'm Kabuli, you know, I'm from Kabul.

1:41:49.140 --> 1:41:51.140
 So if you think about it in Russian terms,

1:41:51.140 --> 1:41:53.260
 you know, it means a lot if you're a Muscovitch,

1:41:53.260 --> 1:41:57.060
 you know, if you're from Pisa or Moscow, I mean, you know.

1:41:57.060 --> 1:42:02.060
 Yeah, well, even here is Pashtunians, Texans, Californians.

1:42:04.460 --> 1:42:07.340
 Yeah, East Coast, West Coast, all that stuff.

1:42:07.340 --> 1:42:08.820
 Those are all part of the mix here.

1:42:08.820 --> 1:42:10.980
 So you asked about Kandahar and Helmand,

1:42:10.980 --> 1:42:14.580
 then I would say, yeah, if you go out to, you know,

1:42:14.580 --> 1:42:18.340
 a pomegranate field, you'll meet a guy

1:42:18.340 --> 1:42:22.460
 who may reckon time differently from you and me,

1:42:22.460 --> 1:42:24.860
 who may not be literate,

1:42:24.860 --> 1:42:27.900
 you may not have ever had a geography lesson,

1:42:27.900 --> 1:42:30.780
 but if you go one door over, you may meet a guy

1:42:31.700 --> 1:42:36.020
 who, you know, his life path has taken him

1:42:36.020 --> 1:42:38.500
 to live in, you know, six countries.

1:42:38.500 --> 1:42:40.340
 He may speak five languages.

1:42:40.340 --> 1:42:41.780
 And these are all things I'm not saying they're all,

1:42:41.780 --> 1:42:43.300
 these are just because people have money

1:42:43.300 --> 1:42:44.140
 can go fly around.

1:42:44.140 --> 1:42:46.860
 I mean, there are people who are displaced by war

1:42:46.860 --> 1:42:48.500
 from late 1970s, right?

1:42:48.500 --> 1:42:50.180
 Even already in the early 70s,

1:42:50.180 --> 1:42:53.620
 people were traveling by the tens of thousands to Iran,

1:42:53.620 --> 1:42:55.220
 you know, as labor migrants.

1:42:55.220 --> 1:42:56.940
 And once you get to Iran, once you get to Pakistan,

1:42:56.940 --> 1:42:59.500
 once you get to Uzbekistan,

1:42:59.500 --> 1:43:02.620
 you then connect to all kinds of cosmopolitan cultures.

1:43:02.620 --> 1:43:04.900
 And in fact, I think one of the themes of the book,

1:43:04.900 --> 1:43:06.020
 you know, that you may or may not have read,

1:43:06.020 --> 1:43:07.740
 it may put you to sleep.

1:43:07.740 --> 1:43:09.580
 You know, Afghan Modern was about, you know,

1:43:09.580 --> 1:43:11.820
 conceptualizing Afghanistan as a cosmopolitan place

1:43:11.820 --> 1:43:14.860
 where for centuries people put on the move

1:43:14.860 --> 1:43:15.700
 and trade in this area.

1:43:15.700 --> 1:43:17.900
 You think of, you know, I think this mischaracterization

1:43:17.900 --> 1:43:20.460
 of places like Helmand and Kandahar,

1:43:20.460 --> 1:43:24.460
 you know, you fly in or you're part of a Marine battalion

1:43:24.460 --> 1:43:26.620
 and you see people there and they look different.

1:43:26.620 --> 1:43:30.220
 And I think in our imagination, if I can generalize,

1:43:30.220 --> 1:43:31.860
 you know, they look like they've been there

1:43:31.860 --> 1:43:33.420
 for millennia, right?

1:43:33.420 --> 1:43:34.860
 The dress, the whatever, right?

1:43:34.860 --> 1:43:35.980
 You think of technology,

1:43:35.980 --> 1:43:38.700
 you think of the mud compounds and so on.

1:43:38.700 --> 1:43:42.740
 You think of, you know, animal drawn transportation,

1:43:42.740 --> 1:43:43.940
 that kind of stuff, right?

1:43:43.940 --> 1:43:46.660
 Or the motorbike, right, at most is what they have.

1:43:46.660 --> 1:43:49.220
 But in fact, if you follow those families,

1:43:49.220 --> 1:43:51.940
 their trade has taken them to Northern India

1:43:51.940 --> 1:43:53.100
 for centuries, right?

1:43:53.100 --> 1:43:56.260
 Their trade has connected them to cosmopolitan centers.

1:43:56.260 --> 1:43:58.060
 You know, say they have a scholar in the family,

1:43:58.060 --> 1:43:59.740
 that scholar may have studied

1:43:59.740 --> 1:44:02.220
 all of the Middle East, South Asia, right?

1:44:02.220 --> 1:44:03.940
 You know, their ancestors may have been horse traders

1:44:03.940 --> 1:44:05.660
 who went all the way to Moscow, right?

1:44:05.660 --> 1:44:07.860
 I mean, we have a sort of records of all these people

1:44:07.860 --> 1:44:10.420
 traveling across Eurasia,

1:44:10.420 --> 1:44:12.580
 pursuing all kinds of livelihoods.

1:44:12.580 --> 1:44:14.700
 And so Afghanistan is this paradox

1:44:14.700 --> 1:44:17.300
 of visually looking remote

1:44:17.300 --> 1:44:20.260
 and looking like it's kind of stuck in time,

1:44:20.260 --> 1:44:22.660
 but the family trajectories

1:44:22.660 --> 1:44:23.740
 and the current trajectories

1:44:23.740 --> 1:44:26.420
 are astoundingly cosmopolitan and mobile.

1:44:26.420 --> 1:44:29.860
 And so, and a conception of being a world center

1:44:29.860 --> 1:44:30.900
 is also quite strong.

1:44:30.900 --> 1:44:33.820
 So, you know, another way to frame that question about like,

1:44:33.820 --> 1:44:36.220
 do they know about 9.11 would be like,

1:44:36.220 --> 1:44:37.420
 why should we know about 9.11?

1:44:37.420 --> 1:44:39.660
 Because we are at the center of something important, right?

1:44:39.660 --> 1:44:41.140
 We are the center of Asia.

1:44:41.140 --> 1:44:42.900
 We are the heart of Asia.

1:44:42.900 --> 1:44:44.540
 We have a kind of historic greatness.

1:44:44.540 --> 1:44:49.180
 We are a proud culture of our own achievements, right?

1:44:49.180 --> 1:44:51.780
 So we're not worried about that, right?

1:44:51.780 --> 1:44:53.020
 That said, I mean, sure,

1:44:53.020 --> 1:44:54.780
 there are different narratives about

1:44:54.780 --> 1:44:56.100
 why Americans are there,

1:44:56.100 --> 1:44:57.860
 why people are being killed.

1:44:57.860 --> 1:45:00.300
 You know, of course you'd find,

1:45:00.300 --> 1:45:02.100
 they want to convert us,

1:45:02.100 --> 1:45:03.180
 they want our gold,

1:45:03.180 --> 1:45:04.620
 they want our opium,

1:45:04.620 --> 1:45:06.580
 they want X, Y, and Z, right?

1:45:06.580 --> 1:45:10.700
 There was a recent story about a Taliban official

1:45:10.700 --> 1:45:11.780
 sitting in an office in Kabul

1:45:11.780 --> 1:45:12.620
 and a journalist asked him,

1:45:12.620 --> 1:45:15.180
 what can you find in this rotating globe?

1:45:15.180 --> 1:45:16.020
 Find your country,

1:45:16.020 --> 1:45:17.900
 find where are we sitting right now?

1:45:17.900 --> 1:45:21.460
 And he was filmed not being able to do it.

1:45:21.460 --> 1:45:22.420
 And so a lot of, you know,

1:45:22.420 --> 1:45:23.740
 race sophisticated Afghans in the diaspora

1:45:23.740 --> 1:45:25.900
 were saying, you know, ha ha, look at this.

1:45:25.900 --> 1:45:27.260
 And that exists.

1:45:27.260 --> 1:45:29.860
 I mean, I think I could go to my Stanford classroom

1:45:29.860 --> 1:45:30.700
 and there'd be a lot of kids

1:45:30.700 --> 1:45:32.580
 who wouldn't know where Afghanistan is too, right?

1:45:32.580 --> 1:45:35.580
 But I guess I wouldn't use those metrics

1:45:35.580 --> 1:45:38.220
 to suggest that this is a place

1:45:38.220 --> 1:45:40.340
 that doesn't have a sense of its place in the world

1:45:40.340 --> 1:45:42.300
 and of geopolitics.

1:45:42.300 --> 1:45:43.220
 I think if anything,

1:45:43.220 --> 1:45:44.500
 being a relatively small country

1:45:44.500 --> 1:45:46.620
 in a very complicated neighborhood,

1:45:46.620 --> 1:45:48.340
 I mean, everybody, every cab driver,

1:45:48.340 --> 1:45:49.740
 I mean, people have, I mean,

1:45:50.620 --> 1:45:52.420
 you know, this is where America is different

1:45:52.420 --> 1:45:54.340
 because I don't think Americans have this sense.

1:45:54.340 --> 1:45:55.860
 You know, we're talking about Moscow and stuff.

1:45:55.860 --> 1:45:58.740
 I think, you know, Moscow cab drivers,

1:45:59.820 --> 1:46:01.580
 I think a lot of them are gonna tell you,

1:46:01.580 --> 1:46:04.460
 like what's happening in the world and why, right?

1:46:04.460 --> 1:46:07.020
 And it's just part of their thing, right?

1:46:07.020 --> 1:46:07.940
 You can find that in Ghana,

1:46:07.940 --> 1:46:09.100
 you can find that in Mexico city, right?

1:46:09.100 --> 1:46:10.220
 You find that lots of places.

1:46:10.220 --> 1:46:13.660
 So I think Afghans are part of a very sophisticated

1:46:13.660 --> 1:46:17.940
 kind of mapping of the world and where they fit in.

1:46:17.940 --> 1:46:20.020
 And a lot of them remarkably had done it firsthand,

1:46:20.020 --> 1:46:21.340
 which is what struck me so much.

1:46:21.340 --> 1:46:22.980
 And, you know, really my experiences

1:46:22.980 --> 1:46:24.460
 from the 1990s and Tashkent places

1:46:24.460 --> 1:46:26.380
 that these guys had already lived

1:46:26.380 --> 1:46:28.420
 in more countries than I'd ever been.

1:46:28.420 --> 1:46:30.100
 They already knew half those languages.

1:46:30.100 --> 1:46:33.220
 I mean, this one friend's Russian was impeccable.

1:46:34.140 --> 1:46:36.460
 And of course it helped, they had Russian girlfriends,

1:46:36.460 --> 1:46:38.780
 they had, you know, they mixed with the police,

1:46:38.780 --> 1:46:40.700
 they had run ins, I mean,

1:46:40.700 --> 1:46:42.940
 this wasn't something you got from a book, right?

1:46:42.940 --> 1:46:44.940
 This was like hard knock life.

1:46:44.940 --> 1:46:47.660
 I mean, one friend was from a wealthy family

1:46:48.580 --> 1:46:51.180
 in this trading diaspora and he was imprisoned.

1:46:51.180 --> 1:46:54.060
 I mean, they sent him to prison in Pakistan

1:46:54.060 --> 1:46:57.140
 and he talks about how he could start like running,

1:46:57.140 --> 1:46:58.900
 running in the jail, you know,

1:46:58.900 --> 1:47:00.580
 taking cigarettes to people, doing little things

1:47:00.580 --> 1:47:03.980
 and kind of, you know, these are not stories of like,

1:47:03.980 --> 1:47:06.020
 oh, I went to Harvard and so I'm so learned

1:47:06.020 --> 1:47:06.860
 because of this.

1:47:06.860 --> 1:47:08.860
 I mean, it's a whole range of experiences.

1:47:08.860 --> 1:47:10.860
 The interesting thing is the survey is a survey

1:47:10.860 --> 1:47:15.860
 and it doesn't reflect ignorance,

1:47:16.500 --> 1:47:18.900
 as you're saying, perhaps,

1:47:18.900 --> 1:47:22.460
 but it may reflect a different geopolitical view

1:47:22.460 --> 1:47:25.660
 of the world than the West has.

1:47:25.660 --> 1:47:29.260
 So if, you know, for a lot of the world,

1:47:29.260 --> 1:47:33.220
 9 11 was one of the most important moments

1:47:33.220 --> 1:47:35.580
 of recent human history.

1:47:35.580 --> 1:47:38.540
 And for Afghanistan to not to know that,

1:47:38.540 --> 1:47:41.420
 especially when they're part of that story,

1:47:41.420 --> 1:47:43.060
 means they have a very different,

1:47:43.060 --> 1:47:46.140
 like there could be a lot of things said.

1:47:46.140 --> 1:47:49.660
 One is the spread of information is different.

1:47:49.660 --> 1:47:52.540
 The channels of the way information is spread.

1:47:52.540 --> 1:47:54.900
 And two of the things they care about,

1:47:54.900 --> 1:47:59.900
 maybe they see themselves as part of a longer arc

1:47:59.980 --> 1:48:03.980
 of history where the bickering of these superpowers

1:48:03.980 --> 1:48:06.220
 that seem to want to go to the moon

1:48:06.220 --> 1:48:09.220
 are not as important as the big sort of arc

1:48:09.220 --> 1:48:11.300
 that's been the story of Afghanistan.

1:48:13.020 --> 1:48:15.100
 You know, that's an interesting idea,

1:48:15.100 --> 1:48:18.220
 but it's still a bit, if at all,

1:48:18.220 --> 1:48:20.100
 representative of the truth.

1:48:20.100 --> 1:48:23.340
 It's heartbreaking that they're not,

1:48:23.340 --> 1:48:28.340
 do not see themselves as active player

1:48:28.700 --> 1:48:32.940
 in this game between the United States

1:48:32.940 --> 1:48:37.420
 and Central Asia, because they're such a critical player.

1:48:37.420 --> 1:48:41.580
 And I feel, and obviously, in many ways,

1:48:41.580 --> 1:48:44.300
 get the short end of the stick in this whole interaction

1:48:44.300 --> 1:48:49.300
 with the invasion of Afghanistan for many years,

1:48:50.100 --> 1:48:54.580
 and then this rushed withdrawal of troops,

1:48:54.580 --> 1:49:03.580
 and now the economic collapse, and it's sad in some ways.

1:49:04.100 --> 1:49:04.940
 That's right.

1:49:04.940 --> 1:49:07.540
 I mean, you know, another way to put it is this.

1:49:07.540 --> 1:49:08.820
 I mean, yeah, there's a range of knowledge,

1:49:08.820 --> 1:49:10.180
 and you're right, the information flows

1:49:10.180 --> 1:49:14.260
 are peculiar to particular geographies

1:49:14.260 --> 1:49:15.100
 and histories and stuff.

1:49:15.100 --> 1:49:17.300
 I think that, you know, plucking out one sample

1:49:17.300 --> 1:49:20.180
 from some fairly remote area,

1:49:20.180 --> 1:49:22.700
 from one like follow the agricultural products.

1:49:22.700 --> 1:49:24.940
 I mean, and this is where, you know,

1:49:24.940 --> 1:49:29.500
 I think urban rural divides used to mean a lot more

1:49:29.500 --> 1:49:30.460
 in the 19th century, right?

1:49:30.460 --> 1:49:32.700
 So a lot of like the nuts and bolts of history

1:49:32.700 --> 1:49:35.780
 is about conceiving of these kinds of distinctions,

1:49:35.780 --> 1:49:37.900
 but I think that if one has the privilege

1:49:37.900 --> 1:49:40.740
 of traveling a bit, you see that like urban areas

1:49:40.740 --> 1:49:43.420
 are fed by rural hinterlands.

1:49:43.420 --> 1:49:47.060
 And if you think of who actually brings the bread,

1:49:47.060 --> 1:49:49.740
 the milk, the pomegranates and so on,

1:49:49.740 --> 1:49:50.740
 it creates these networks.

1:49:50.740 --> 1:49:53.620
 And then, you know, mobility channels,

1:49:53.620 --> 1:49:55.740
 information and so on.

1:49:55.740 --> 1:49:57.220
 But yeah, but your broader point

1:49:57.220 --> 1:49:58.060
 about like the tragedy of this,

1:49:58.060 --> 1:50:01.140
 I mean, I guess if I can quote a brilliant student of mine,

1:50:01.140 --> 1:50:04.220
 an Afghan American woman who just received her PhD,

1:50:04.220 --> 1:50:07.980
 who's now, you know, a doctor, he's a great scholar.

1:50:07.980 --> 1:50:10.620
 You know, we've done several events now

1:50:10.620 --> 1:50:11.980
 trying to just think through what's happened.

1:50:11.980 --> 1:50:14.620
 And of course, she's very emotionally affected by it.

1:50:14.620 --> 1:50:17.340
 And she continues to ask a really great question.

1:50:17.340 --> 1:50:19.780
 If I can get her phrasing right, you know,

1:50:19.780 --> 1:50:21.500
 if you think of the cycle of like the Taliban

1:50:21.500 --> 1:50:24.340
 being in power in 2001 and the way in which

1:50:24.340 --> 1:50:25.660
 that affected women in particular,

1:50:25.660 --> 1:50:28.940
 you know, half Afghan, half of the society, right?

1:50:28.940 --> 1:50:30.980
 Then you think of this 20 year period of violence

1:50:30.980 --> 1:50:34.340
 and, you know, missed exits, right?

1:50:34.340 --> 1:50:38.300
 And repeated tragedy that also it created a space.

1:50:38.300 --> 1:50:39.980
 I mean, it created a space for a whole generation.

1:50:39.980 --> 1:50:41.340
 I'd say generationally, it created a sense,

1:50:41.340 --> 1:50:44.380
 a space for people to realize something new.

1:50:44.380 --> 1:50:47.020
 And I think, so we have to attend to the dynamism

1:50:47.020 --> 1:50:47.860
 of the society, right?

1:50:47.860 --> 1:50:51.100
 So yeah, this happened mostly in Kabul,

1:50:51.100 --> 1:50:53.900
 other big cities, Mazar Sharif, Herat, and Kandahar.

1:50:55.420 --> 1:50:56.700
 But you can't limit your analysis to that

1:50:56.700 --> 1:51:00.540
 because things like radio, television,

1:51:00.540 --> 1:51:02.340
 everyone got a TV channel.

1:51:02.340 --> 1:51:05.340
 There's a wonderful documentary called Afghan Star

1:51:05.340 --> 1:51:07.420
 that I recommend to your listeners and viewers

1:51:07.420 --> 1:51:10.620
 that it's about a singing show, a singing contest show.

1:51:10.620 --> 1:51:12.100
 But you see just for some of these things

1:51:12.100 --> 1:51:14.060
 about like connections, I mean,

1:51:14.060 --> 1:51:17.940
 it's a show by an independent television network

1:51:17.940 --> 1:51:21.180
 that did drama, it did kind of infomercials

1:51:21.180 --> 1:51:24.300
 for the government and huge American investment in it.

1:51:24.300 --> 1:51:25.540
 So it wasn't politically neutral,

1:51:25.540 --> 1:51:27.660
 but it did talk shows, did all this kind of stuff.

1:51:27.660 --> 1:51:31.820
 But it did a singing show that became incredibly popular,

1:51:31.820 --> 1:51:33.300
 modeled upon the British American,

1:51:33.300 --> 1:51:35.260
 you know, American Idol kind of stuff, you know,

1:51:35.260 --> 1:51:36.260
 and you could vote.

1:51:36.260 --> 1:51:39.020
 So it had a kind of democratic practice element.

1:51:39.020 --> 1:51:41.260
 But it's fascinating to see that, you know,

1:51:41.260 --> 1:51:44.780
 people hooked up generators to televisions and watch this,

1:51:44.780 --> 1:51:46.940
 you know, you think of like literacy rates,

1:51:46.940 --> 1:51:47.980
 literacy rates are imperfect.

1:51:47.980 --> 1:51:50.620
 And, you know, people who study, you know,

1:51:50.620 --> 1:51:52.860
 medieval or modern Europe talk about how,

1:51:52.860 --> 1:51:56.100
 yeah, no one could read and there weren't many books,

1:51:56.100 --> 1:51:58.700
 but if someone had a book, it'd be read aloud

1:51:58.700 --> 1:52:00.340
 to a whole village potentially or gathering.

1:52:00.340 --> 1:52:01.460
 So there isn't much, you know,

1:52:01.460 --> 1:52:03.780
 some of these metrics don't get what people actually

1:52:03.780 --> 1:52:05.180
 receive as information or exposure

1:52:05.180 --> 1:52:08.900
 because there's the magnifying power of open spaces

1:52:08.900 --> 1:52:11.540
 and hearing radio in group settings,

1:52:11.540 --> 1:52:15.340
 seeing television group settings, having telephone,

1:52:15.340 --> 1:52:18.420
 you know, cheap telephones, which then become an access

1:52:18.420 --> 1:52:20.380
 point to the world and social media, right?

1:52:20.380 --> 1:52:23.140
 So all the stuff swept across Afghan society

1:52:23.140 --> 1:52:28.140
 as it did elsewhere, you know, in the last decade or more.

1:52:28.260 --> 1:52:31.180
 So Afghan society became, you know, in important ways,

1:52:31.180 --> 1:52:33.300
 really connected to everything going on.

1:52:33.300 --> 1:52:34.460
 And so you see that reflected politically

1:52:34.460 --> 1:52:35.300
 and what people wanted.

1:52:35.300 --> 1:52:37.300
 So you had some people obviously

1:52:37.300 --> 1:52:39.020
 back to return to the Taliban,

1:52:39.020 --> 1:52:41.180
 some people wanted the status quo,

1:52:41.180 --> 1:52:44.260
 but increasingly many more people wanted something else.

1:52:44.260 --> 1:52:45.700
 And one of the great failures was

1:52:45.700 --> 1:52:47.980
 to expose people to democracy,

1:52:47.980 --> 1:52:50.020
 but only give them the rigged version.

1:52:50.020 --> 1:52:52.780
 And so the US State Department in particular

1:52:52.780 --> 1:52:55.060
 continued to double down on faked elections

1:52:55.060 --> 1:52:57.860
 for the parliament and for the presidency in Afghanistan.

1:52:57.860 --> 1:52:58.980
 What kind of elections?

1:52:58.980 --> 1:53:02.140
 Faked, fraudulent elections for parliament

1:53:02.140 --> 1:53:06.740
 and for president in Afghanistan again and again

1:53:06.740 --> 1:53:08.300
 from the very beginning.

1:53:08.300 --> 1:53:12.260
 And those elections were partly theater for the US,

1:53:12.260 --> 1:53:14.380
 like for remaining on the road that you're describing,

1:53:14.380 --> 1:53:15.820
 right, for not deviating, for not exiting

1:53:15.820 --> 1:53:18.660
 because we were building democracy there.

1:53:18.660 --> 1:53:19.820
 In reality, the US government knew

1:53:19.820 --> 1:53:21.940
 it was never really building democracy there.

1:53:21.940 --> 1:53:24.100
 It was establishing control

1:53:24.100 --> 1:53:26.540
 and elections were one of the means to gather control,

1:53:26.540 --> 1:53:27.380
 right?

1:53:27.380 --> 1:53:28.460
 But then you had on the ground,

1:53:28.460 --> 1:53:32.100
 especially among young people going to university,

1:53:32.100 --> 1:53:33.340
 you know, having experiences

1:53:33.340 --> 1:53:36.180
 that were denied to them before,

1:53:36.180 --> 1:53:37.620
 you know, they took these problems so seriously.

1:53:37.620 --> 1:53:40.060
 So part of the disillusionment that we see today

1:53:40.060 --> 1:53:43.340
 is that, you know, they believe what the US told them

1:53:43.340 --> 1:53:45.100
 that they're constructing democracy.

1:53:45.100 --> 1:53:46.980
 And of course, you know, cynics like us may be thinking,

1:53:46.980 --> 1:53:49.300
 well, you know, you're not really doing that.

1:53:49.300 --> 1:53:50.420
 You're backing fraud.

1:53:50.420 --> 1:53:52.180
 They believed it when they were younger

1:53:52.180 --> 1:53:54.060
 and now they're actually smart enough

1:53:54.060 --> 1:53:56.380
 to understand that it's a farce.

1:53:56.380 --> 1:53:59.140
 But in so indirectly had the consequence

1:53:59.140 --> 1:54:03.460
 of actually working and that it taught the young

1:54:03.460 --> 1:54:07.020
 over a period of 20 years, young folks to believe

1:54:07.020 --> 1:54:08.420
 that democracy is possible

1:54:08.420 --> 1:54:10.860
 and then to realize what democracy is not.

1:54:10.860 --> 1:54:11.700
 It's just the current system.

1:54:11.700 --> 1:54:12.780
 That's beautifully said, beautifully said.

1:54:12.780 --> 1:54:15.460
 And so, but now look at us, now it's, you know,

1:54:15.460 --> 1:54:17.900
 it's now November.

1:54:17.900 --> 1:54:21.620
 And so this whole period,

1:54:21.620 --> 1:54:23.300
 and I wouldn't say like, you know,

1:54:23.300 --> 1:54:25.540
 I wouldn't cast the last 20 years

1:54:25.540 --> 1:54:27.780
 if we're looking at all the achievements, you know,

1:54:27.780 --> 1:54:30.220
 I wouldn't put them in an American tally sheet,

1:54:30.220 --> 1:54:31.620
 like, oh, this is something

1:54:31.620 --> 1:54:32.660
 we should pat ourselves on the back for.

1:54:32.660 --> 1:54:34.540
 I think that much of this happened actually

1:54:34.540 --> 1:54:35.940
 against what the Americans wanted.

1:54:35.940 --> 1:54:39.260
 I mean, that the kind of free thinking,

1:54:39.260 --> 1:54:42.340
 democracy wanting, I mean, even like, you know,

1:54:42.340 --> 1:54:43.260
 we could point out on the religious,

1:54:43.260 --> 1:54:44.100
 go back to the religious sphere.

1:54:44.100 --> 1:54:47.780
 I mean, the African religious landscape

1:54:47.780 --> 1:54:49.300
 became very pluralistic.

1:54:50.220 --> 1:54:52.100
 Lots of young people wanted a different kind

1:54:52.100 --> 1:54:56.300
 of secular politics, but the old guard

1:54:56.300 --> 1:54:59.020
 who wanted the status quo and wanted something

1:54:59.020 --> 1:55:01.220
 that they'd fought for in 1980s tended

1:55:01.220 --> 1:55:04.060
 to still get American backing as the political leads,

1:55:04.060 --> 1:55:06.860
 who still tended to monopolize political power.

1:55:06.860 --> 1:55:09.460
 So all this stuff was happening in different ways.

1:55:09.460 --> 1:55:10.740
 I mean, the Americans established

1:55:10.740 --> 1:55:12.780
 this American University of Afghanistan,

1:55:12.780 --> 1:55:13.940
 which was, I think, one of the best things

1:55:13.940 --> 1:55:14.780
 the U.S. did there.

1:55:14.780 --> 1:55:18.020
 And I regret that the U.S. didn't fund 20 more,

1:55:18.020 --> 1:55:19.940
 you know, sprinkling them across the country,

1:55:19.940 --> 1:55:20.780
 making them accessible to people,

1:55:20.780 --> 1:55:23.140
 because it was, you know, again,

1:55:23.140 --> 1:55:26.420
 it wasn't an engine of Americanization.

1:55:26.420 --> 1:55:27.260
 It was just opportunity.

1:55:27.260 --> 1:55:28.660
 And so the thirst for higher education

1:55:28.660 --> 1:55:29.860
 was really extraordinary there.

1:55:29.860 --> 1:55:31.020
 It was never really met.

1:55:31.020 --> 1:55:34.180
 The U.S. tended to put money in primary education,

1:55:34.180 --> 1:55:37.060
 which much of that too was fraudulent.

1:55:37.060 --> 1:55:38.420
 But so you have all this interesting dynamism.

1:55:38.420 --> 1:55:42.220
 You have, you know, the arts, you have a critical space.

1:55:42.220 --> 1:55:43.660
 I mean, I call it a public sphere

1:55:43.660 --> 1:55:45.660
 in the classic European sense.

1:55:45.660 --> 1:55:46.780
 You know, the Afghans made of their own.

1:55:46.780 --> 1:55:49.180
 And again, it wasn't Americanization.

1:55:49.180 --> 1:55:51.500
 It wasn't imposed.

1:55:51.500 --> 1:55:54.220
 It was something that Afghans built across generations,

1:55:54.220 --> 1:55:58.340
 but really with a firm foundation among youth,

1:55:58.340 --> 1:56:01.620
 who wanted, importantly, a multiethnic Afghan society.

1:56:01.620 --> 1:56:03.660
 You asked about Pashtuns and that kind of stuff.

1:56:03.660 --> 1:56:07.660
 And a lot of that language in recent years was,

1:56:07.660 --> 1:56:09.820
 they were aware that the U.S.-backed government

1:56:09.820 --> 1:56:11.860
 was playing ethnic politics

1:56:11.860 --> 1:56:14.460
 and trying to kind of put people on the blocks

1:56:14.460 --> 1:56:17.860
 and mobilize people based on their ethnic identity.

1:56:17.860 --> 1:56:19.820
 And there was a younger cohort of people who said,

1:56:19.820 --> 1:56:21.540
 you know, we are Afghan.

1:56:21.540 --> 1:56:23.260
 And then there was interesting social media stuff

1:56:23.260 --> 1:56:25.580
 where people would say, I am Hazara,

1:56:25.580 --> 1:56:28.340
 but I'm also Tajik, I'm also Uzbek.

1:56:28.340 --> 1:56:30.380
 I mean, it was a way of creating

1:56:30.380 --> 1:56:33.540
 a multiethnic Afghan national identity

1:56:33.540 --> 1:56:34.980
 that embraced everything.

1:56:34.980 --> 1:56:37.860
 I mean, very utopian, you know, super utopian, right?

1:56:37.860 --> 1:56:39.220
 But symbolically, it was very important

1:56:39.220 --> 1:56:42.940
 that they rejected being mobilized politically,

1:56:42.940 --> 1:56:45.340
 you know, voting as a Hazara or voting as whatever.

1:56:45.340 --> 1:56:47.580
 And of course, there were communities who wanted to,

1:56:47.580 --> 1:56:50.660
 you know, vote as that ethnic community.

1:56:50.660 --> 1:56:52.220
 But there are also people who said, you know,

1:56:52.220 --> 1:56:55.060
 let's put a kind of civic nationalism first,

1:56:55.060 --> 1:56:57.740
 one that accommodates, I think, pluralism

1:56:57.740 --> 1:57:00.180
 in a way that rejected the kind of majoritarian politics

1:57:00.180 --> 1:57:03.380
 of one ethnic group dominating the thing.

1:57:03.380 --> 1:57:04.580
 So all this stuff was quite interesting.

1:57:04.580 --> 1:57:07.380
 I mean, women were asserting themselves

1:57:07.380 --> 1:57:09.580
 across multiple spheres.

1:57:09.580 --> 1:57:10.740
 Of course, it remained patriarchal.

1:57:10.740 --> 1:57:11.580
 Of course, there were struggles.

1:57:11.580 --> 1:57:12.420
 Of course, there was violence.

1:57:12.420 --> 1:57:15.100
 Of course, you know, there's no utopia.

1:57:15.100 --> 1:57:18.820
 But the door on all that shut on August 15.

1:57:18.820 --> 1:57:22.020
 So to go back to the quote that I wanted to offer

1:57:22.020 --> 1:57:25.620
 from the student, now professor,

1:57:25.620 --> 1:57:28.540
 was it, you know, in trying to make sense of this,

1:57:28.540 --> 1:57:31.780
 and you mentioned the tragic arc here,

1:57:31.780 --> 1:57:35.060
 if you think of the 20 years, like, she asked, you know,

1:57:35.060 --> 1:57:37.620
 why did you go to war in our country?

1:57:37.620 --> 1:57:39.220
 Basically, why did you do this to us for 20 years

1:57:39.220 --> 1:57:41.460
 when this was never about us?

1:57:41.460 --> 1:57:43.860
 You know, you never asked us if you wanted to come.

1:57:43.860 --> 1:57:46.420
 You never asked us what you wanted to build here.

1:57:46.420 --> 1:57:47.460
 You didn't ask us when you were coming

1:57:47.460 --> 1:57:49.420
 and you didn't ask us when you were leaving.

1:57:49.420 --> 1:57:51.460
 You just did this all on your own.

1:57:51.460 --> 1:57:53.780
 And we tried to make the most of it.

1:57:53.780 --> 1:57:55.820
 And then you pulled the rug out from under us,

1:57:55.820 --> 1:57:57.860
 you know, at the 11th hour,

1:57:57.860 --> 1:58:02.100
 and returned to power, probably by diplomacy.

1:58:02.100 --> 1:58:04.460
 It wasn't, at the end, just a military loss.

1:58:04.460 --> 1:58:06.980
 I mean, it was a series of diplomatic decisions.

1:58:06.980 --> 1:58:08.500
 I mean, the idea, you asked about alternatives.

1:58:08.500 --> 1:58:10.900
 I mean, give me a Bagram.

1:58:10.900 --> 1:58:12.740
 I mean, holding to the timeline.

1:58:12.740 --> 1:58:14.260
 I mean, the Biden people did not need to hold

1:58:14.260 --> 1:58:17.620
 to the Doha Agreement that Trump had signed.

1:58:17.620 --> 1:58:19.820
 I mean, every American president

1:58:19.820 --> 1:58:21.900
 writes his or her own foreign policy, right?

1:58:21.900 --> 1:58:24.580
 So the Biden administration acted as if,

1:58:24.580 --> 1:58:27.460
 and they tried to convince us that their hands were tied,

1:58:28.460 --> 1:58:31.340
 and that it was either this or 20 more years of war

1:58:31.340 --> 1:58:36.020
 or some absurd kind of, you know, false alternative.

1:58:36.020 --> 1:58:37.980
 And so, but I think that's important

1:58:37.980 --> 1:58:40.020
 for American audiences to hear that, you know,

1:58:40.020 --> 1:58:42.180
 they're like, you came to here to experiment.

1:58:42.180 --> 1:58:44.180
 You came here to punish.

1:58:44.180 --> 1:58:47.820
 You came here to kind of reassert, you know,

1:58:47.820 --> 1:58:49.860
 your dominance the world stage,

1:58:49.860 --> 1:58:53.460
 you know, to work out the fear and hurt of 9 11

1:58:53.460 --> 1:58:55.020
 that we talked about, which was so real, you know,

1:58:55.020 --> 1:58:59.060
 impalpable and so important for American politics since then.

1:58:59.060 --> 1:59:00.900
 Like you did, you worked out your problems,

1:59:00.900 --> 1:59:02.820
 you know, on us, on our territory.

1:59:03.940 --> 1:59:06.140
 And now what do we have for it?

1:59:06.140 --> 1:59:08.820
 You know, and then the people who had a stake

1:59:08.820 --> 1:59:12.180
 in that system, imperfect as it was,

1:59:12.180 --> 1:59:13.700
 have been desperate to leave.

1:59:13.700 --> 1:59:15.620
 And so this, I don't know how much people are aware of this,

1:59:15.620 --> 1:59:19.300
 but, you know, I'm a scholar, I work in California,

1:59:19.300 --> 1:59:23.380
 you know, I have friends, I edited a journal on Afghanistan

1:59:23.380 --> 1:59:26.820
 and, you know, but I'm not a politician, I'm not a soldier,

1:59:26.820 --> 1:59:28.780
 but people assume that, you know,

1:59:28.780 --> 1:59:31.100
 Afghans have been desperately trying to reach me

1:59:31.100 --> 1:59:34.700
 and anyone who is kind of on the radar as an American

1:59:34.700 --> 1:59:36.020
 to help get them out.

1:59:36.020 --> 1:59:39.420
 You know, that's the kind of like, you know,

1:59:39.420 --> 1:59:42.260
 the symbol of voting with your feet, you know,

1:59:42.260 --> 1:59:43.100
 is quite powerful.

1:59:43.100 --> 1:59:45.900
 I mean, there's a huge swath of society

1:59:45.900 --> 1:59:47.260
 that doesn't want the system

1:59:47.260 --> 1:59:50.580
 and is literally living in terror about it.

1:59:50.580 --> 1:59:51.420
 Naturally women, you know,

1:59:51.420 --> 1:59:52.860
 I mean, especially women of a certain age,

1:59:52.860 --> 1:59:54.780
 I mean, they feel like their lives are over.

1:59:54.780 --> 1:59:56.820
 I mean, there is an epidemic of suicide.

1:59:58.380 --> 2:00:02.380
 They feel betrayed and some people have done

2:00:02.380 --> 2:00:03.540
 some good things in getting people out.

2:00:03.540 --> 2:00:05.740
 You know, I mean, some, you know,

2:00:05.740 --> 2:00:08.140
 the US military vets have been, you know,

2:00:08.140 --> 2:00:10.980
 at the forefront of working to get out people,

2:00:10.980 --> 2:00:14.500
 you know, that they know they owe,

2:00:14.500 --> 2:00:17.580
 but the US government doesn't want these people.

2:00:17.580 --> 2:00:19.660
 I mean, they have created all these obstacles

2:00:19.660 --> 2:00:24.660
 to allowing a safety valve for people to leave.

2:00:24.820 --> 2:00:27.820
 Looking forward from a perspective of leadership,

2:00:27.820 --> 2:00:31.100
 how do we avoid these kinds of mistakes?

2:00:31.100 --> 2:00:33.620
 So obviously some interests,

2:00:33.620 --> 2:00:36.940
 some aspects of human nature led to this war.

2:00:36.940 --> 2:00:41.060
 How do we resist that in the future?

2:00:41.060 --> 2:00:44.540
 I guess beyond my moral and intellectual capacity,

2:00:44.540 --> 2:00:45.620
 I'll just say this, I mean, looking at it,

2:00:45.620 --> 2:00:47.980
 again, looking at it from my home ground as the university,

2:00:47.980 --> 2:00:51.780
 and I think of the intellectual,

2:00:53.100 --> 2:00:55.900
 you know, ways of thinking that I think students

2:00:55.900 --> 2:00:59.060
 should develop for themselves as citizens, right?

2:00:59.060 --> 2:01:01.940
 Maybe that's where to start is like historical thinking.

2:01:01.940 --> 2:01:03.620
 I mean, these are all, you know,

2:01:03.620 --> 2:01:04.900
 I try to tell people, you know,

2:01:04.900 --> 2:01:07.460
 if you want to do robotics, computer science,

2:01:07.460 --> 2:01:08.700
 you'd be a doctor or whatever.

2:01:08.700 --> 2:01:10.100
 You should study history.

2:01:10.100 --> 2:01:11.700
 Yeah, I mean, you don't have to be in a story like me,

2:01:11.700 --> 2:01:13.300
 and it's, you know, my job isn't perfect.

2:01:13.300 --> 2:01:15.100
 My profession is deeply flawed, right?

2:01:15.100 --> 2:01:17.620
 But as I get older, I'm like,

2:01:17.620 --> 2:01:18.460
 there are fewer and fewer historians

2:01:18.460 --> 2:01:20.460
 that I actually like and want to hang out with and stuff.

2:01:20.460 --> 2:01:22.220
 So it's like, I'm not offering myself

2:01:22.220 --> 2:01:23.180
 as like a model for anything,

2:01:23.180 --> 2:01:25.660
 but you know, whether you're a, you know,

2:01:25.660 --> 2:01:27.820
 you carry the mail or you're a brain surgeon, whatever.

2:01:27.820 --> 2:01:30.500
 I mean, I think it's a way of civic engagement

2:01:30.500 --> 2:01:32.700
 and a way of like, you know, ethical being in the world

2:01:32.700 --> 2:01:34.500
 that we need to familiarize ourselves with,

2:01:34.500 --> 2:01:35.980
 because if you're an American

2:01:35.980 --> 2:01:38.180
 or if you're from a rich country, you know,

2:01:38.180 --> 2:01:40.260
 you need to be aware of your effect

2:01:40.260 --> 2:01:42.260
 on an intricate world.

2:01:42.260 --> 2:01:45.100
 You can't say anymore that you don't know or care

2:01:45.100 --> 2:01:46.820
 what's happening in Afghanistan

2:01:46.820 --> 2:01:49.580
 or really circle the globe and point to a place.

2:01:49.580 --> 2:01:53.380
 I mean, we're all connected and we have ethical obligations.

2:01:54.420 --> 2:01:55.940
 That's one place to start, but I would just say this,

2:01:55.940 --> 2:01:57.540
 and this is a lot for a self critique,

2:01:57.540 --> 2:02:01.180
 and that is so much of my teaching

2:02:01.180 --> 2:02:03.020
 and like the themes of my research have been about empire,

2:02:03.020 --> 2:02:05.460
 you know, how big states work,

2:02:05.460 --> 2:02:07.500
 not only on big territories like the Russian Empire

2:02:07.500 --> 2:02:08.340
 and Soviet Union and stuff,

2:02:08.340 --> 2:02:11.860
 but the way in which power often is projected

2:02:11.860 --> 2:02:14.140
 beyond those boundaries in ways that we don't see.

2:02:14.140 --> 2:02:16.940
 So this is where things like neoliberalism

2:02:16.940 --> 2:02:18.780
 or just, you know, if you want to take capitalism

2:02:18.780 --> 2:02:21.860
 or just things that, you know, the idea of humanity

2:02:21.860 --> 2:02:24.900
 or of liberalism or of humanitarianism,

2:02:24.900 --> 2:02:26.900
 ideas that move beyond state boundaries

2:02:26.900 --> 2:02:30.140
 are all things that we think about as affecting power

2:02:30.140 --> 2:02:33.700
 in some ways that often harm people, right?

2:02:33.700 --> 2:02:36.140
 So I think part of, as I've seen my job so far

2:02:36.140 --> 2:02:37.620
 is to think about, you know,

2:02:37.620 --> 2:02:39.940
 building upon the work of my people in grad school

2:02:39.940 --> 2:02:42.140
 and, you know, scholars that have affected me.

2:02:42.140 --> 2:02:43.820
 I mean, you know, we're all concerned

2:02:43.820 --> 2:02:45.580
 with how power works and its effects

2:02:45.580 --> 2:02:49.060
 and trying to be attuned to understanding

2:02:50.020 --> 2:02:50.980
 things that aren't visible, right,

2:02:50.980 --> 2:02:51.860
 that we should be thinking about,

2:02:51.860 --> 2:02:52.940
 that should be known to us.

2:02:52.940 --> 2:02:55.260
 And as scholars, we can hopefully play some useful role

2:02:55.260 --> 2:03:00.260
 in showing effects that aren't, you know, obvious initially.

2:03:01.620 --> 2:03:03.220
 So empire is a framework to think about this.

2:03:03.220 --> 2:03:05.940
 And so you think about invading foreign countries.

2:03:05.940 --> 2:03:07.980
 Obviously, if you're a scholar of empire,

2:03:07.980 --> 2:03:09.580
 you've seen what that looks like,

2:03:09.580 --> 2:03:11.620
 and that's horrific, right?

2:03:11.620 --> 2:03:13.100
 You look at things like racism

2:03:13.100 --> 2:03:16.780
 as one of the ideological pillars of empire.

2:03:16.780 --> 2:03:17.620
 You know, that's horrific.

2:03:17.620 --> 2:03:18.460
 It must be critiqued.

2:03:18.460 --> 2:03:20.900
 It must be, you know, we must be educated against.

2:03:22.100 --> 2:03:24.100
 Some of the, you know, gender exploitation of empire

2:03:24.100 --> 2:03:25.420
 is also something to highlight, you know,

2:03:25.420 --> 2:03:26.620
 to rectify and so on.

2:03:27.820 --> 2:03:28.660
 You know, to be moral beings,

2:03:28.660 --> 2:03:31.260
 we need to think about past inequality

2:03:31.260 --> 2:03:35.220
 and the legacies of violence and destruction that live on.

2:03:35.220 --> 2:03:36.340
 I mean, living in the Americas.

2:03:36.340 --> 2:03:39.620
 I mean, look at, you know, we're all on stolen land.

2:03:39.620 --> 2:03:43.020
 We're all in the sense living with the fruits of genocide

2:03:43.020 --> 2:03:44.380
 and slavery and all those things

2:03:44.380 --> 2:03:46.980
 that are hard to come to terms with, right?

2:03:46.980 --> 2:03:49.740
 But the last few months in Afghanistan

2:03:49.740 --> 2:03:53.380
 and thinking about empire, I think, made me more humble

2:03:53.380 --> 2:03:57.100
 when I read people who say,

2:03:57.100 --> 2:03:59.980
 to put it simply, have taken some joy in this moment,

2:03:59.980 --> 2:04:02.020
 saying like, well, the Americans

2:04:02.020 --> 2:04:03.940
 got kicked out of Afghanistan.

2:04:03.940 --> 2:04:07.020
 You know, if you're against empire, this is a good thing.

2:04:07.020 --> 2:04:09.620
 This is a kind of victory of anti colonial.

2:04:10.780 --> 2:04:14.020
 You could see from the perspective of Afghanistan

2:04:14.020 --> 2:04:16.940
 that America is not some kind of place

2:04:16.940 --> 2:04:18.900
 that has an ideal of freedom

2:04:18.900 --> 2:04:21.980
 and all the kind of things that we Americans tell ourselves,

2:04:21.980 --> 2:04:25.820
 but it's more America has the ideal of empire,

2:04:25.820 --> 2:04:28.420
 that there's one place that has the truth

2:04:28.420 --> 2:04:31.700
 and everybody else must follow this truth.

2:04:31.700 --> 2:04:34.340
 And so from a perspective of Afghanistan,

2:04:34.340 --> 2:04:36.460
 it could be a victory against this idea

2:04:36.460 --> 2:04:38.700
 of centralized truth of empire.

2:04:39.780 --> 2:04:41.660
 That's another way to tell the story.

2:04:41.660 --> 2:04:43.500
 And then in that sense, it's a victory.

2:04:43.500 --> 2:04:46.580
 And in that sense also, I mean,

2:04:46.580 --> 2:04:49.340
 you push back against this somewhat,

2:04:49.340 --> 2:04:54.340
 this idea of Afghanistan as the graveyard of empires.

2:04:54.620 --> 2:04:56.140
 Right, right.

2:04:56.140 --> 2:04:59.980
 And outside this, I mean, I'm a critic of empire.

2:04:59.980 --> 2:05:04.060
 I mean, you know, colonialism is a political phenomenon

2:05:04.060 --> 2:05:05.060
 that stays with us.

2:05:05.060 --> 2:05:06.900
 And I think, you know, we need scholars

2:05:06.900 --> 2:05:08.900
 to point to the way in which it still works

2:05:08.900 --> 2:05:10.060
 and still does harm.

2:05:11.780 --> 2:05:12.820
 But it's part of being an empire

2:05:12.820 --> 2:05:15.780
 that you can just get up and leave a place, right?

2:05:15.780 --> 2:05:19.820
 That you can remake its politics on one day.

2:05:19.820 --> 2:05:22.580
 And then because it fails to advance your agenda

2:05:22.580 --> 2:05:26.180
 at one moment, you simply walk away.

2:05:26.180 --> 2:05:27.860
 I mean, you know, we can point to other moments.

2:05:27.860 --> 2:05:30.380
 I mean, 1947 on the subcontinent,

2:05:30.380 --> 2:05:32.820
 you know, the way that the British withdrew

2:05:34.500 --> 2:05:37.780
 played a significant role in mass violence,

2:05:37.780 --> 2:05:40.100
 you know, that accompanied partition.

2:05:40.100 --> 2:05:41.620
 It wasn't all the actions of the British

2:05:41.620 --> 2:05:44.420
 that, you know, dictated that, right?

2:05:44.420 --> 2:05:46.940
 There were lots of actors who chose to pick up,

2:05:46.940 --> 2:05:49.860
 you know, the knife to kill their neighbor and so on.

2:05:49.860 --> 2:05:52.020
 I mean, there's lots of agency in that moment

2:05:52.020 --> 2:05:54.700
 as there is now in what's happening in Afghanistan.

2:05:54.700 --> 2:05:56.980
 But I think the capriciousness,

2:05:56.980 --> 2:06:01.980
 I mean, the ability to act as if your political decisions

2:06:03.020 --> 2:06:06.340
 about other people's lives, you know,

2:06:06.340 --> 2:06:09.580
 are something that can be made, you know, in secret.

2:06:09.580 --> 2:06:11.820
 They can be made willy nilly.

2:06:11.820 --> 2:06:14.580
 They really are beyond the accountability, you know,

2:06:14.580 --> 2:06:17.020
 of those who are actually going to live

2:06:17.020 --> 2:06:20.580
 with the consequences of shifting the cards on a deck

2:06:20.580 --> 2:06:23.460
 in a way that decides who rules and who doesn't.

2:06:23.460 --> 2:06:25.420
 I would love to hear your conversation

2:06:25.420 --> 2:06:28.420
 with somebody I just talked to, which is Neil Ferguson,

2:06:28.420 --> 2:06:30.980
 who argues on the topic of empire,

2:06:30.980 --> 2:06:34.700
 that you can also zoom out even further

2:06:34.700 --> 2:06:38.220
 and say, weigh the good and the bad of empire.

2:06:38.220 --> 2:06:41.260
 And he argues, I think he gets a lot of flack for this

2:06:41.260 --> 2:06:45.780
 from other historians, that like the British empire

2:06:45.780 --> 2:06:50.420
 did more good than bad in certain moments of history.

2:06:50.420 --> 2:06:52.860
 And that's an uncomfortable truth.

2:06:52.860 --> 2:06:55.300
 There's like levels, it's a cake

2:06:55.300 --> 2:06:57.860
 with layers of uncomfortable truths.

2:06:57.860 --> 2:07:00.780
 And it's not a cake at all because none of it tastes good.

2:07:00.780 --> 2:07:01.620
 Right.

2:07:01.620 --> 2:07:04.180
 I mean, I would continue to disagree with Neil Ferguson.

2:07:04.180 --> 2:07:06.460
 So I'm still working out where I am

2:07:06.460 --> 2:07:08.820
 and what this moment does to kind of, I think,

2:07:08.820 --> 2:07:12.380
 qualify my understanding of the past into,

2:07:12.380 --> 2:07:15.460
 I think in a moment of humility, I do,

2:07:15.460 --> 2:07:18.660
 and I'm probably reacting to the kind of, as you put it,

2:07:18.660 --> 2:07:21.020
 I mean, the idea that this is like a good thing

2:07:21.020 --> 2:07:23.140
 that American power has been defeated here.

2:07:23.140 --> 2:07:25.780
 I mean, I do think American power should contract.

2:07:25.780 --> 2:07:28.540
 And I don't think, and again,

2:07:28.540 --> 2:07:30.660
 if I had to create a tally sheet

2:07:30.660 --> 2:07:32.020
 of what the Americans did in the US,

2:07:32.020 --> 2:07:35.460
 I mean, I mentioned the American University of Afghanistan.

2:07:35.460 --> 2:07:37.660
 It could have done that without invading the country

2:07:37.660 --> 2:07:38.900
 and killing people.

2:07:38.900 --> 2:07:41.460
 I've not now become an apologist for empire.

2:07:41.460 --> 2:07:44.460
 I'm not now a mini Neil Ferguson,

2:07:44.460 --> 2:07:48.860
 but ending empire is, I mean,

2:07:51.580 --> 2:07:54.180
 those decisions you make are in some ways

2:07:54.180 --> 2:07:56.620
 a continuation of imperil hubris, right?

2:07:57.900 --> 2:07:59.380
 So you're not really out of empire yet.

2:07:59.380 --> 2:08:01.020
 You're not really contracting empire

2:08:01.020 --> 2:08:03.500
 for those who are living it, you know?

2:08:03.500 --> 2:08:05.580
 But I think it's also, I mean, maybe I put it this way,

2:08:05.580 --> 2:08:08.300
 it's be careful what you ask for, you know?

2:08:08.300 --> 2:08:10.980
 I mean, I wanted the US out of Afghanistan,

2:08:12.380 --> 2:08:14.980
 but I wanted there to be a political settlement.

2:08:14.980 --> 2:08:18.100
 I wanted my cake and I wanted to eat it too, right?

2:08:18.100 --> 2:08:20.580
 I wanted all kinds of things to be different, right?

2:08:20.580 --> 2:08:22.740
 But why is going to Afghanistan even needed for that?

2:08:22.740 --> 2:08:26.260
 You can play all those games of geopolitics

2:08:26.260 --> 2:08:30.140
 without ever invading and taking ownership of the place.

2:08:30.140 --> 2:08:33.500
 It feels like the war, it feels like,

2:08:33.500 --> 2:08:35.660
 I mean, I'm not exactly sure

2:08:35.660 --> 2:08:38.420
 what military force is necessary for,

2:08:38.420 --> 2:08:41.820
 except for targeted intense attacks.

2:08:41.820 --> 2:08:46.500
 It feels like to me, the right thing to do after 9 11

2:08:46.500 --> 2:08:49.940
 was to show what was a display of force

2:08:49.940 --> 2:08:52.040
 unlike anything the world has ever seen

2:08:52.040 --> 2:08:54.180
 for a very short amount of time.

2:08:54.180 --> 2:08:57.220
 Targeted at, sure, a terrorist,

2:08:57.220 --> 2:08:59.860
 at certain strongholds and so on.

2:08:59.860 --> 2:09:03.500
 And then in and out and then focus on education,

2:09:03.500 --> 2:09:08.500
 on empowering women into the education system,

2:09:08.980 --> 2:09:10.740
 all those kinds of things that have to do

2:09:10.740 --> 2:09:13.980
 with supporting the culture, the education,

2:09:13.980 --> 2:09:16.420
 the flourishing of the place.

2:09:16.420 --> 2:09:21.260
 It has nothing to do with military policing essentially.

2:09:21.260 --> 2:09:22.100
 Right.

2:09:22.100 --> 2:09:25.100
 I mean, I think, yeah, if you look at it through that lens,

2:09:25.100 --> 2:09:28.100
 I mean, if any Afghanistan and then if any Iraq

2:09:28.100 --> 2:09:33.100
 didn't end Al Qaeda, it didn't end terrorism, right?

2:09:33.300 --> 2:09:38.260
 It didn't really deflate these ideologies entirely.

2:09:38.260 --> 2:09:40.860
 There were, if you like, you could say there were,

2:09:41.900 --> 2:09:46.900
 some limited discrediting of certain kinds of ideas.

2:09:47.200 --> 2:09:48.040
 But in fact, I mean,

2:09:48.040 --> 2:09:50.620
 look at the phenomenon of suicide bombing.

2:09:50.620 --> 2:09:51.700
 I mean, it spread.

2:09:51.700 --> 2:09:53.780
 I mean, it was never an Islamic thing.

2:09:53.780 --> 2:09:55.420
 It was never a Muslim thing.

2:09:55.420 --> 2:09:58.100
 Some Muslims adopted it in some places,

2:09:58.100 --> 2:10:00.340
 but the circuits of knowledge

2:10:00.340 --> 2:10:02.740
 about how to do these kinds of things only expanded

2:10:02.740 --> 2:10:05.700
 with the insurgencies that emerged in Afghanistan and Iraq,

2:10:05.700 --> 2:10:06.860
 and then they kind of became connected.

2:10:06.860 --> 2:10:08.380
 And then they began to the present.

2:10:08.380 --> 2:10:10.220
 I mean, the Islamic state is,

2:10:10.220 --> 2:10:12.580
 it's the best thing that happened to the Taliban ever

2:10:12.580 --> 2:10:17.100
 because it's on the basis of its supposed new stance

2:10:18.420 --> 2:10:20.080
 as a counterterrorism outfit

2:10:20.080 --> 2:10:22.460
 that it will get recognition from all its neighbors.

2:10:22.460 --> 2:10:24.380
 It will get recognition from Russia.

2:10:24.380 --> 2:10:26.900
 I mean, already with the evacuation of the airport,

2:10:26.900 --> 2:10:29.340
 the United States was collaborating with the Taliban

2:10:29.340 --> 2:10:31.300
 against the Islamic state

2:10:31.300 --> 2:10:34.140
 and openly talking about the Taliban

2:10:34.140 --> 2:10:35.780
 as if they were partners in the security operation.

2:10:35.780 --> 2:10:40.000
 So, and then Al Qaeda remains present in Afghanistan, so.

2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:42.260
 Trillions of dollars spent.

2:10:42.260 --> 2:10:43.860
 Yeah.

2:10:43.860 --> 2:10:48.520
 The drones up above bombing places

2:10:48.520 --> 2:10:50.140
 that result in civilian death,

2:10:50.140 --> 2:10:53.220
 the death of children, the death of fathers and mothers,

2:10:53.220 --> 2:10:56.060
 and those stories even at the individual level

2:10:56.060 --> 2:10:58.940
 propagate virally across the land,

2:10:58.940 --> 2:11:01.700
 creating potentially more terrorists.

2:11:01.700 --> 2:11:04.920
 And a cynical view of the trillions of dollars

2:11:04.920 --> 2:11:08.460
 is the military industrial complex

2:11:08.460 --> 2:11:13.460
 where there's just a momentum where after 9 11,

2:11:13.460 --> 2:11:16.240
 the feeling like we should do something

2:11:16.240 --> 2:11:18.740
 led to us doing something.

2:11:18.740 --> 2:11:21.580
 And then a lot of people realizing they can make money

2:11:21.580 --> 2:11:23.500
 from doing more of that something.

2:11:23.500 --> 2:11:25.380
 And then it's just the momentum

2:11:25.380 --> 2:11:28.620
 where no one person is sitting there

2:11:28.620 --> 2:11:30.900
 petting a cat in an evil way,

2:11:30.900 --> 2:11:33.220
 saying we're going to spend all of this money

2:11:33.220 --> 2:11:36.260
 and create more suffering and create more terrorism.

2:11:36.260 --> 2:11:37.860
 But it's just something about that momentum

2:11:37.860 --> 2:11:39.140
 that leads to that.

2:11:39.140 --> 2:11:42.540
 And to me, honestly, I'm still a sucker.

2:11:42.540 --> 2:11:43.940
 I believe in leadership.

2:11:43.940 --> 2:11:47.540
 I believe in great charismatic leaders

2:11:47.540 --> 2:11:51.460
 and the power of that want to do evil and to do good.

2:11:51.460 --> 2:11:56.460
 And it felt like I honestly put the blame on George Bush,

2:11:58.620 --> 2:12:03.020
 Obama, Trump, and Biden for lack of leadership.

2:12:03.020 --> 2:12:05.060
 Yeah, definitely, definitely.

2:12:05.060 --> 2:12:05.900
 I agree.

2:12:05.900 --> 2:12:08.020
 Yeah, there is the military industrial complex component,

2:12:08.020 --> 2:12:09.360
 which is huge.

2:12:09.360 --> 2:12:11.300
 And there's also, I mean, speaking of government leadership,

2:12:11.300 --> 2:12:15.020
 it's also, I'd say the imbalance of power within Washington.

2:12:15.020 --> 2:12:18.700
 I mean, the Pentagon used this moment,

2:12:20.160 --> 2:12:21.260
 well, beginning in 2001,

2:12:21.260 --> 2:12:24.620
 I think to assert this authority

2:12:24.620 --> 2:12:26.300
 at the expense of other institutions

2:12:26.300 --> 2:12:27.940
 of national government.

2:12:27.940 --> 2:12:30.300
 I mean, the State Department diplomacy

2:12:31.780 --> 2:12:35.820
 has become a shadow of what it was once capable of doing.

2:12:35.820 --> 2:12:37.980
 And of course, I mean, other historians, US historians,

2:12:37.980 --> 2:12:39.620
 which I'm not formally a historian of the United States,

2:12:39.620 --> 2:12:42.040
 but we can go back to talk about Vietnam.

2:12:42.040 --> 2:12:46.200
 We talk about lots of Cold War and post Cold War engagements.

2:12:47.380 --> 2:12:49.000
 And I think we need a reckoning

2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:52.580
 about how the United States uses military power,

2:12:52.580 --> 2:12:55.220
 why we devote so much to our military budget

2:12:55.220 --> 2:12:56.780
 and what could be available to us

2:12:56.780 --> 2:12:59.940
 if we had a more sensible view

2:12:59.940 --> 2:13:03.060
 of the value of military power, of its effectiveness.

2:13:03.060 --> 2:13:04.900
 And I think we're willing to hammer home

2:13:04.900 --> 2:13:05.900
 that this was a defeat.

2:13:05.900 --> 2:13:08.020
 I mean, I think there should be accountability.

2:13:08.020 --> 2:13:09.780
 And this could be a kind of opening

2:13:09.780 --> 2:13:11.220
 for a kind of bipartisan conversation,

2:13:11.220 --> 2:13:16.220
 because if you are a kind of American militarist,

2:13:16.460 --> 2:13:18.440
 I mean, you have to look at the leadership

2:13:18.440 --> 2:13:20.660
 that got you to a place where you were defeated

2:13:20.660 --> 2:13:25.660
 by men wearing sandals firing AK 47s, right?

2:13:25.980 --> 2:13:27.980
 Yeah, there should be a humility with that.

2:13:29.480 --> 2:13:31.820
 I mean, we should actually say that,

2:13:31.820 --> 2:13:34.200
 like literally the...

2:13:34.200 --> 2:13:35.040
 Oh, we lost.

2:13:35.040 --> 2:13:35.880
 You should say we lost.

2:13:35.880 --> 2:13:37.580
 It wasn't just, you know...

2:13:37.580 --> 2:13:40.700
 The American military lost.

2:13:40.700 --> 2:13:43.620
 Yeah, and I feel I have very mixed feelings

2:13:43.620 --> 2:13:46.340
 and it's, I don't know, a ton of veterans,

2:13:46.340 --> 2:13:48.160
 but Mitch and I have topped my share

2:13:48.160 --> 2:13:52.380
 and have a student now and they're suffering

2:13:52.380 --> 2:13:54.260
 because they look at the sacrifices that they made

2:13:54.260 --> 2:13:55.260
 that I didn't make.

2:13:55.260 --> 2:13:57.060
 I mean, American society didn't make the sacrifices.

2:13:57.060 --> 2:13:59.420
 I mean, men and women lost limbs,

2:13:59.420 --> 2:14:01.220
 they lost eyes, they lost lives.

2:14:02.900 --> 2:14:06.140
 There's been this, of course, quiet epidemic of suicide

2:14:06.140 --> 2:14:07.980
 among veterans.

2:14:07.980 --> 2:14:10.860
 And I've heard some stories

2:14:10.860 --> 2:14:12.300
 the fact that the State Department

2:14:12.300 --> 2:14:14.760
 is seeing a similar surge of suicides

2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:19.760
 because they see their adult life's work collapse.

2:14:19.820 --> 2:14:20.740
 They've seen their relationships.

2:14:20.740 --> 2:14:23.500
 I mean, they've seen phone calls in the middle of the night

2:14:23.500 --> 2:14:26.460
 from people who they entrusted with their lives

2:14:26.460 --> 2:14:28.340
 who they know are gonna be targeted.

2:14:28.340 --> 2:14:30.820
 I mean, some of them have already been killed.

2:14:30.820 --> 2:14:32.780
 They've seen the, I mean, I think just,

2:14:32.780 --> 2:14:35.620
 I'd imagine just ideologically and professionally

2:14:35.620 --> 2:14:40.060
 what they believed in and what they sacrificed for

2:14:40.060 --> 2:14:41.780
 has vanished.

2:14:41.780 --> 2:14:44.700
 And I think that's bad.

2:14:44.700 --> 2:14:46.740
 I mean, historically thinking of some of the precedents

2:14:46.740 --> 2:14:49.580
 you were thinking of, I mean, if you think of,

2:14:49.580 --> 2:14:51.300
 first of all, at a human level,

2:14:51.300 --> 2:14:53.220
 I feel horrible for those people who,

2:14:53.220 --> 2:14:55.500
 I may not have agreed with everything they had done

2:14:55.500 --> 2:14:56.620
 and their choices in life,

2:14:56.620 --> 2:14:59.260
 but I respect the fact that many good people

2:14:59.260 --> 2:15:03.540
 went out of the best intentions as young people

2:15:03.540 --> 2:15:05.900
 to do the right thing and make things right.

2:15:05.900 --> 2:15:07.180
 And I respect that.

2:15:07.180 --> 2:15:09.980
 And I've met enough to know that there were people

2:15:09.980 --> 2:15:12.180
 who saw the gray and complexity

2:15:12.180 --> 2:15:14.440
 and that's all you can hope for.

2:15:16.340 --> 2:15:19.220
 But we don't want a generation of disillusioned veterans

2:15:20.900 --> 2:15:23.460
 if we look at the other postwar moments.

2:15:23.460 --> 2:15:25.940
 And this is kind of a postwar moment where,

2:15:25.940 --> 2:15:27.740
 I think we need a conversation with American veterans

2:15:27.740 --> 2:15:31.040
 about what they've gone through and what they're feeling.

2:15:31.040 --> 2:15:33.100
 And they still have skin in the game

2:15:33.100 --> 2:15:33.940
 because their personal connections

2:15:33.940 --> 2:15:35.460
 and the end of their histories.

2:15:35.460 --> 2:15:37.260
 And they're also gonna be future leaders.

2:15:37.260 --> 2:15:39.380
 I mean, veterans.

2:15:39.380 --> 2:15:43.940
 People who have served are often great men and women.

2:15:43.940 --> 2:15:45.080
 That's true.

2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:50.080
 And throughout history,

2:15:50.080 --> 2:15:54.500
 whether you sacrifice you served in fighting World War II,

2:15:54.500 --> 2:15:55.940
 in fighting Vietnam,

2:15:55.940 --> 2:15:58.780
 that's going to mold you in different ways.

2:15:58.780 --> 2:16:02.620
 That's going to mold how you are as a leader

2:16:02.620 --> 2:16:04.740
 that leads this country forward.

2:16:04.740 --> 2:16:07.200
 And so you have to have an honest conversation

2:16:07.200 --> 2:16:12.200
 about what was the role of the war in Afghanistan,

2:16:13.680 --> 2:16:15.000
 the war in the Middle East,

2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:18.060
 the war on terror in the history of America.

2:16:18.060 --> 2:16:20.100
 If we just look at the full context

2:16:20.100 --> 2:16:22.340
 at the end of this 21st century,

2:16:22.340 --> 2:16:24.420
 how are we going to remember this

2:16:24.420 --> 2:16:27.800
 and how that's going to result in our future interactions

2:16:27.800 --> 2:16:30.560
 with small and large countries,

2:16:30.560 --> 2:16:32.860
 with China or some proxy war with China,

2:16:32.860 --> 2:16:36.420
 with Russia or some proxy war with Russia

2:16:36.420 --> 2:16:39.180
 what's the role of oil and natural resources and opium

2:16:39.180 --> 2:16:40.620
 and all those kinds of things.

2:16:40.620 --> 2:16:45.220
 What's the role of military power in the world.

2:16:45.220 --> 2:16:46.580
 And now with COVID,

2:16:50.220 --> 2:16:55.220
 it's almost like because of the many failures

2:16:55.220 --> 2:16:58.820
 of the US government and many leaders

2:17:00.860 --> 2:17:04.700
 in science and politics to respond effectively

2:17:04.700 --> 2:17:07.820
 and quickly to COVID,

2:17:07.820 --> 2:17:12.340
 we kind of forget that we fumbled this other thing too.

2:17:12.340 --> 2:17:15.340
 And it's hard to know which is going to be more expensive.

2:17:17.340 --> 2:17:19.620
 They seem to be symptoms of something

2:17:21.820 --> 2:17:26.820
 of a same kind of source problem of leadership,

2:17:28.140 --> 2:17:31.740
 of bureaucracy, of the way information

2:17:31.740 --> 2:17:34.500
 and intelligence flows throughout the US government.

2:17:34.500 --> 2:17:35.660
 All those kinds of things.

2:17:35.660 --> 2:17:39.340
 And that hopefully motivates young leaders to fix things.

2:17:39.340 --> 2:17:41.140
 Definitely, I mean, if there's one theme

2:17:41.140 --> 2:17:43.060
 that jumps out to me and thinking about this moment,

2:17:43.060 --> 2:17:45.100
 I mean, if we recognize that we live

2:17:45.100 --> 2:17:48.540
 in a kind of crisis of democracy in the United States

2:17:48.540 --> 2:17:50.900
 and in other countries that have long been proud

2:17:50.900 --> 2:17:51.820
 of their democratic traditions,

2:17:51.820 --> 2:17:54.220
 if we see them being under assault from certain quarters,

2:17:54.220 --> 2:17:57.700
 I think military defeat is yet another addition

2:17:57.700 --> 2:18:00.020
 to all the aspects of this that you mentioned.

2:18:00.020 --> 2:18:04.020
 I mean, the fact that military defeat is a giant match

2:18:04.020 --> 2:18:05.580
 that you're throwing on this fire potentially,

2:18:05.580 --> 2:18:07.780
 if we think of its legacies

2:18:07.780 --> 2:18:09.100
 and other postwar environments,

2:18:09.100 --> 2:18:12.700
 when the veteran angle is one,

2:18:12.700 --> 2:18:15.500
 when you have people who feel betrayed,

2:18:15.500 --> 2:18:17.060
 I mean, they have been fodder

2:18:17.060 --> 2:18:18.580
 for the far right in other settings.

2:18:18.580 --> 2:18:19.820
 I mean, interwar Europe is very much

2:18:19.820 --> 2:18:23.020
 about mobilizing dissolution veterans

2:18:23.020 --> 2:18:25.260
 in the name of right wing fascist politics.

2:18:26.580 --> 2:18:28.940
 If one thinks too of this moment

2:18:28.940 --> 2:18:32.060
 of really increasing xenophobia,

2:18:32.060 --> 2:18:34.580
 our immigration debate is now talking about

2:18:34.580 --> 2:18:36.420
 whether or not Afghans should be permitted at all

2:18:36.420 --> 2:18:39.020
 in the United States after 20 years.

2:18:39.020 --> 2:18:41.540
 And I think immediately the response in Europe,

2:18:41.540 --> 2:18:44.300
 which I followed to some extent, focusing on Germany,

2:18:45.220 --> 2:18:49.100
 because it was really ramping up deportations of Afghans

2:18:49.100 --> 2:18:50.820
 leading up to this collapse.

2:18:50.820 --> 2:18:52.140
 And now they have been,

2:18:53.540 --> 2:18:57.100
 a lot of right wing center right politicians in Germany

2:18:57.100 --> 2:19:01.220
 have been watching all this with an eye to,

2:19:01.220 --> 2:19:05.220
 using it to their advantage for a domestic German audience

2:19:05.220 --> 2:19:07.660
 to say, in the context of recent elections,

2:19:07.660 --> 2:19:09.820
 that we are the party who will defend you

2:19:09.820 --> 2:19:11.460
 against these Afghans who are gonna be coming from this.

2:19:11.460 --> 2:19:13.380
 So what I've tried to emphasize

2:19:13.380 --> 2:19:15.180
 in talking to different groups about this moment

2:19:15.180 --> 2:19:17.700
 is that it won't be confined to Afghanistan

2:19:17.700 --> 2:19:18.540
 or even the region.

2:19:18.540 --> 2:19:20.700
 I mean, obviously malnutrition, hunger

2:19:20.700 --> 2:19:23.140
 will send Afghans to neighboring states,

2:19:23.140 --> 2:19:27.180
 but where the European right is resurgent,

2:19:27.180 --> 2:19:28.620
 this has been a gift, right?

2:19:28.620 --> 2:19:30.700
 To say that the Afghans are coming,

2:19:30.700 --> 2:19:32.460
 they're brown skinned, they're Muslim,

2:19:32.460 --> 2:19:34.980
 they're uneducated, they're gonna want your women.

2:19:34.980 --> 2:19:37.900
 And they will take the odd sexual assault case

2:19:37.900 --> 2:19:41.460
 or the odd, whatever, dramatic act of violence

2:19:41.460 --> 2:19:45.380
 that happens numerically in any population.

2:19:45.380 --> 2:19:47.380
 And they will magnify that to say that,

2:19:49.020 --> 2:19:51.740
 our far right group is gonna save the nation.

2:19:51.740 --> 2:19:54.620
 And sorry, the main point I wanted to speak of leadership

2:19:54.620 --> 2:19:56.740
 was that I think the serial,

2:19:56.740 --> 2:20:00.180
 well, there were many, many carnal sins, if you like,

2:20:00.180 --> 2:20:02.580
 but if you go back to our analogy of all the exits,

2:20:02.580 --> 2:20:04.740
 I mean, what blocked some of those exits

2:20:04.740 --> 2:20:09.660
 was an absence of truth and transparency and the lying.

2:20:09.660 --> 2:20:11.620
 And so, I mean, this is no secret,

2:20:11.620 --> 2:20:15.140
 anyone who's followed this, but we've allowed,

2:20:15.140 --> 2:20:17.460
 and you think of the general mistrust of government,

2:20:17.460 --> 2:20:21.820
 mistrust of authority across the board,

2:20:21.820 --> 2:20:26.740
 of professors, of economists, of scientists, doctors, right?

2:20:26.740 --> 2:20:28.900
 Well, I actually think that's the hopeful thing to me

2:20:28.900 --> 2:20:33.900
 about the internet is the internet hates inauthenticity.

2:20:34.140 --> 2:20:36.180
 They can smell bullshit much better.

2:20:36.180 --> 2:20:38.300
 And I think that motivates young leaders

2:20:38.300 --> 2:20:40.580
 to be transparent and authentic.

2:20:40.580 --> 2:20:45.260
 So like the very problems we've been seeing,

2:20:45.260 --> 2:20:49.180
 this kind of attitude of authority where,

2:20:49.180 --> 2:20:53.220
 oh, the populace, they're too busy with their own lives.

2:20:53.220 --> 2:20:54.900
 They're not smart enough to understand

2:20:54.900 --> 2:20:57.580
 the full complexities of the things we're dealing with.

2:20:57.580 --> 2:20:59.820
 So we're not going to even communicate to them

2:20:59.820 --> 2:21:02.860
 the full complexities, we're just going to decide

2:21:02.860 --> 2:21:05.300
 and then tell them what we decided

2:21:05.300 --> 2:21:08.100
 and conceive some kind of narrative

2:21:08.100 --> 2:21:12.340
 that makes it easy for them to consume this decision.

2:21:13.500 --> 2:21:16.620
 As opposed to that, I really believe,

2:21:16.620 --> 2:21:18.820
 I see there's a hunger for authenticity

2:21:18.820 --> 2:21:21.780
 of when you're making decisions,

2:21:21.780 --> 2:21:23.780
 when you're looking at the rest of the world

2:21:23.780 --> 2:21:28.780
 and trying to untangle this complexity, the internet,

2:21:28.980 --> 2:21:33.220
 the public, the world wants to see you as a leader struggle

2:21:33.220 --> 2:21:37.700
 with the tension of these ideas, to change your mind,

2:21:37.700 --> 2:21:40.380
 to recognize your own flaws

2:21:40.380 --> 2:21:43.060
 and your own thinking from a month ago, all that,

2:21:43.060 --> 2:21:44.300
 the full complexity of it,

2:21:44.300 --> 2:21:47.660
 also acknowledge the uncertainty as with COVID,

2:21:47.660 --> 2:21:51.820
 also with the wars, I think there's a hunger for that.

2:21:51.820 --> 2:21:53.860
 And I think that's just going to change the nature

2:21:53.860 --> 2:21:56.340
 of leadership in the 21st century.

2:21:56.340 --> 2:21:57.180
 I hope so.

2:21:57.180 --> 2:21:59.780
 I think all the things you've highlighted,

2:21:59.780 --> 2:22:00.900
 accountability is part of that, right?

2:22:00.900 --> 2:22:04.740
 I mean, we need honesty, openness,

2:22:04.740 --> 2:22:06.820
 and then acknowledgement of mistakes.

2:22:06.820 --> 2:22:08.900
 Humility is the key to all learning, right?

2:22:08.900 --> 2:22:10.860
 But also, I mean, you think just the headline

2:22:10.860 --> 2:22:14.660
 from yesterday, the horrible drone strike,

2:22:14.660 --> 2:22:18.180
 which was really the last kind of American military action

2:22:18.180 --> 2:22:20.460
 on the day that the US was, I think,

2:22:20.460 --> 2:22:22.660
 mostly departing from Kabul,

2:22:22.660 --> 2:22:25.500
 wiped out an entire family, mostly children.

2:22:25.500 --> 2:22:27.020
 You know, the US acknowledged that, yes,

2:22:27.020 --> 2:22:29.540
 this was not the ISIS bombing outfit

2:22:29.540 --> 2:22:31.300
 that they thought it was.

2:22:31.300 --> 2:22:33.660
 But yesterday, they did a quick review.

2:22:34.860 --> 2:22:36.940
 I'm not an expert on drone strikes in the aftermath,

2:22:36.940 --> 2:22:38.940
 but those who've looked at it more closely said

2:22:38.940 --> 2:22:41.860
 it was basically whole cloth taken

2:22:41.860 --> 2:22:44.900
 from what the US government has been saying

2:22:44.900 --> 2:22:46.980
 after all these strikes, you know,

2:22:46.980 --> 2:22:48.100
 reproducing the same language

2:22:48.100 --> 2:22:51.740
 and basically pointing to technical errors,

2:22:51.740 --> 2:22:56.740
 but denying that there were any procedural mistakes

2:22:57.420 --> 2:22:59.780
 or flaws, or it was just kind of,

2:22:59.780 --> 2:23:01.580
 they found little ways of acknowledging

2:23:01.580 --> 2:23:02.660
 things did not go as planned,

2:23:02.660 --> 2:23:06.340
 but, you know, we follow the policies essentially,

2:23:06.340 --> 2:23:08.060
 and yeah, that's it.

2:23:08.060 --> 2:23:09.700
 It's not a crime.

2:23:09.700 --> 2:23:13.700
 It's a way of not even saying, you know, we screwed up.

2:23:13.700 --> 2:23:15.620
 And it's kind of the legal ease

2:23:15.620 --> 2:23:19.700
 that suddenly makes a war crime not a war crime, you know?

2:23:19.700 --> 2:23:22.420
 And that reflects, I think,

2:23:22.420 --> 2:23:24.660
 our refusal to take accountability.

2:23:24.660 --> 2:23:26.660
 I think people are really sick of that

2:23:26.660 --> 2:23:29.580
 in a way where the opposite is true,

2:23:29.580 --> 2:23:33.660
 which is they get excited for people who are not,

2:23:33.660 --> 2:23:35.540
 for leaders who are not that,

2:23:35.540 --> 2:23:37.660
 and so they're not going to punish you

2:23:37.660 --> 2:23:40.260
 for saying, I made a mistake.

2:23:42.740 --> 2:23:44.740
 I just had a conversation with Francis Collins,

2:23:44.740 --> 2:23:46.180
 the director of the NIH,

2:23:46.180 --> 2:23:49.300
 and part of my criticism towards Anthony Fauci

2:23:49.300 --> 2:23:54.180
 has been that it's such subtle,

2:23:54.180 --> 2:23:58.900
 but such crucial communication of mistakes made.

2:23:58.900 --> 2:24:00.540
 If you make a small mistake,

2:24:00.540 --> 2:24:04.100
 it is so powerful to communicate,

2:24:04.100 --> 2:24:05.500
 I think we messed up.

2:24:05.500 --> 2:24:08.620
 We thought this was true, and it wasn't.

2:24:08.620 --> 2:24:11.220
 So the obvious thing there was with masks

2:24:11.220 --> 2:24:13.220
 early in the pandemic.

2:24:13.220 --> 2:24:14.620
 There's so much uncertainty.

2:24:14.620 --> 2:24:17.020
 It's so understandable to make mistakes

2:24:17.020 --> 2:24:21.140
 or to also be concerned about what kind of hysteria,

2:24:21.140 --> 2:24:23.420
 different statements you make lead to.

2:24:23.420 --> 2:24:25.020
 Just being transparent about that

2:24:25.020 --> 2:24:26.820
 and saying we were not correct

2:24:26.820 --> 2:24:28.100
 and saying the thing we said before.

2:24:28.100 --> 2:24:33.100
 That's so powerful to communicate, to gain trust.

2:24:33.340 --> 2:24:35.180
 And the opposite is true.

2:24:35.180 --> 2:24:38.580
 When you do this legal ease type of talk,

2:24:38.580 --> 2:24:40.780
 it destroys trust.

2:24:40.780 --> 2:24:45.780
 And again, I really think the lessons of recent history

2:24:47.180 --> 2:24:51.060
 teach us how to be a leader

2:24:51.060 --> 2:24:53.580
 and teach young leaders how to be leaders.

2:24:53.580 --> 2:24:56.740
 And so I have a lot of hope.

2:24:56.740 --> 2:24:58.580
 Partially thanks for the internet.

2:24:58.580 --> 2:25:00.140
 Yeah, yeah, that's great.

2:25:00.140 --> 2:25:00.980
 Oh, humility.

2:25:00.980 --> 2:25:03.580
 I mean, we need humility, accountability, honesty.

2:25:05.340 --> 2:25:07.660
 And yes, studying the past is an important way to do that.

2:25:07.660 --> 2:25:09.700
 I mean, to learn from past mistakes.

2:25:09.700 --> 2:25:11.900
 And obviously there's stories of inspiration and courage

2:25:11.900 --> 2:25:14.700
 and we can take some kind of assistance from that too.

2:25:14.700 --> 2:25:19.100
 But also learning from, learning how not to do things.

2:25:19.100 --> 2:25:23.140
 And then analogies are never like one to one.

2:25:23.140 --> 2:25:24.260
 I mean, we talk about Vietnam.

2:25:24.260 --> 2:25:27.100
 I mean, I think many Vietnam veterans would say,

2:25:27.100 --> 2:25:28.500
 yeah, this is like deja vu.

2:25:28.500 --> 2:25:31.700
 I mean, the story, the visuals of the Kabul airport

2:25:31.700 --> 2:25:35.580
 and of the Saigon embassy were not the same,

2:25:35.580 --> 2:25:38.220
 but close enough that people would juxtapose them.

2:25:38.220 --> 2:25:39.620
 All of this right now, but I would just ask people

2:25:39.620 --> 2:25:44.620
 that over analogizing is also a kind of path down

2:25:44.780 --> 2:25:47.900
 making errors of judgment and comparison,

2:25:47.900 --> 2:25:51.260
 and then sameness, but it's stretch.

2:25:51.260 --> 2:25:52.380
 I mean, like 9.11 itself,

2:25:52.380 --> 2:25:56.580
 I think the idea that people lack the imagination

2:25:56.580 --> 2:25:58.100
 within our security apparatus

2:25:58.100 --> 2:26:00.540
 to think this was even possible, right?

2:26:00.540 --> 2:26:03.380
 And you think of the simplicity of having a $10 lock

2:26:03.380 --> 2:26:06.380
 on a cockpit door, could have wanted all this.

2:26:06.380 --> 2:26:09.500
 And again, I'm not saying either the time

2:26:09.500 --> 2:26:11.780
 or in hindsight that I am omniscient about all this,

2:26:11.780 --> 2:26:15.100
 but I had just been living in Germany the year before,

2:26:15.100 --> 2:26:16.980
 and there was a plot there.

2:26:16.980 --> 2:26:18.780
 This guy was hatching from Germany

2:26:18.780 --> 2:26:22.220
 to blow up the mausoleum of Attertwerk in Ankara

2:26:22.220 --> 2:26:23.580
 with an airplane.

2:26:23.580 --> 2:26:27.460
 And so if you kind of dig, it wasn't unimaginable

2:26:27.460 --> 2:26:29.700
 that you would use an airplane as a weapon.

2:26:29.700 --> 2:26:31.580
 And the Bush administration kept saying,

2:26:31.580 --> 2:26:32.900
 no one had ever heard of this.

2:26:32.900 --> 2:26:33.740
 Who would do this?

2:26:33.740 --> 2:26:35.540
 Like, well, not a lot of people do this.

2:26:35.540 --> 2:26:37.180
 And then at that very moment,

2:26:37.180 --> 2:26:41.220
 my wife was teaching the Joseph Conrad novel Secret Agent,

2:26:41.220 --> 2:26:44.100
 which was about a conspiratorial organization

2:26:44.100 --> 2:26:46.340
 that wanted to bomb,

2:26:46.340 --> 2:26:48.940
 actually in retrospect, it was kind of suicide bombing

2:26:48.940 --> 2:26:50.660
 because they tricked this guy into doing it,

2:26:50.660 --> 2:26:53.460
 but they wanted to bomb the Greenwich Observatory

2:26:53.460 --> 2:26:55.340
 for some obscure political purpose.

2:26:57.140 --> 2:27:00.660
 So that's an instance in which, you know, the novel,

2:27:00.660 --> 2:27:02.460
 right, to go back to our kind of humanities pitch, right,

2:27:02.460 --> 2:27:05.940
 that my point was that, you know,

2:27:05.940 --> 2:27:08.180
 as you mentioned, we need humanity, transparency,

2:27:08.180 --> 2:27:09.940
 but also imagination, right?

2:27:09.940 --> 2:27:14.100
 I think part of expanding our imagination is by, you know,

2:27:14.100 --> 2:27:16.580
 I mean, obviously delving into your fields, you know,

2:27:16.580 --> 2:27:19.020
 of engineering and the sciences and robotics

2:27:19.020 --> 2:27:20.860
 and artificial intelligence and all that rich landscape.

2:27:20.860 --> 2:27:24.740
 And then, but also we find this in film, poetry, literature,

2:27:24.740 --> 2:27:28.500
 I mean, just the kind of stretching that we need to do

2:27:28.500 --> 2:27:31.460
 to really educate ourselves more fully, right,

2:27:31.460 --> 2:27:34.860
 across the spectrum of everything humans need

2:27:34.860 --> 2:27:37.340
 to imagine, to reimagine security.

2:27:37.340 --> 2:27:38.660
 You know, so much of what we talked about today,

2:27:38.660 --> 2:27:41.660
 I mean, so much of, you know,

2:27:41.660 --> 2:27:43.860
 our security is affected by others perception

2:27:43.860 --> 2:27:45.300
 of their insecurity, right?

2:27:46.580 --> 2:27:49.620
 Which unleashes a whole web of emotions.

2:27:49.620 --> 2:27:54.060
 Can you tell me about the Afghan people,

2:27:54.060 --> 2:27:57.020
 what they love, what they fear,

2:27:57.020 --> 2:28:00.100
 what they dream of for themselves and for their nation?

2:28:00.100 --> 2:28:02.020
 Is there something to say,

2:28:02.020 --> 2:28:04.860
 to speak to to the spirit of the people

2:28:04.860 --> 2:28:09.620
 that may humanize them and maybe speak to the concerns

2:28:09.620 --> 2:28:10.820
 and the hopes they have?

2:28:12.020 --> 2:28:13.940
 Yeah, I think I, you know, as an outsider,

2:28:13.940 --> 2:28:16.300
 I hesitate to make any grand statement,

2:28:16.300 --> 2:28:17.900
 but I would say, listen, I mean,

2:28:19.020 --> 2:28:21.540
 there are a number of documentary films

2:28:21.540 --> 2:28:23.420
 that are incredibly rich

2:28:23.420 --> 2:28:26.180
 that will offer your listeners and viewers a snapshot.

2:28:26.180 --> 2:28:29.460
 So there is Afghan Star, you know,

2:28:29.460 --> 2:28:32.500
 which really brings you in the homes of a set of people

2:28:32.500 --> 2:28:34.980
 who, you know, they want stardom, they're artists,

2:28:34.980 --> 2:28:36.700
 they want to express themselves.

2:28:36.700 --> 2:28:39.940
 Some want to push political boundaries, cultural boundaries.

2:28:39.940 --> 2:28:42.660
 There's a woman who gets into hot water for dancing.

2:28:42.660 --> 2:28:46.460
 But yeah, you realize that, I mean, people,

2:28:46.460 --> 2:28:48.020
 I mean, they love art, they love music,

2:28:48.020 --> 2:28:50.700
 they love poetry, they love expression.

2:28:50.700 --> 2:28:52.820
 You know, people want to care for their children.

2:28:52.820 --> 2:28:54.260
 They want safety of their families.

2:28:54.260 --> 2:28:57.380
 They want to enjoy what everyone enjoys, you know?

2:28:57.380 --> 2:29:00.540
 I think it's a very humanizing portrait.

2:29:00.540 --> 2:29:01.660
 There's another great documentary film

2:29:01.660 --> 2:29:05.700
 called Love Crimes of Kabul,

2:29:06.620 --> 2:29:10.020
 which is a great snapshot of the post 2000 world

2:29:10.020 --> 2:29:11.500
 that the Americans shaped a lot of ways.

2:29:11.500 --> 2:29:13.580
 And it's about a women's prison.

2:29:13.580 --> 2:29:15.500
 And it's incredibly revealing

2:29:15.500 --> 2:29:19.820
 because it's about young girls and what they want.

2:29:19.820 --> 2:29:22.220
 Well, not just young, but young, teenage,

2:29:22.220 --> 2:29:23.420
 and then some middle aged people

2:29:23.420 --> 2:29:26.180
 who are accused of moral crimes,

2:29:26.180 --> 2:29:29.900
 ranging from homicide, which one woman admits to,

2:29:29.900 --> 2:29:33.700
 to having sexual relations outside of marriage.

2:29:33.700 --> 2:29:36.260
 And so it shows in a way continuity

2:29:36.260 --> 2:29:38.660
 with the previous Taliban regime

2:29:38.660 --> 2:29:40.340
 and that women are in prison

2:29:40.340 --> 2:29:42.300
 for things that you wouldn't be in prison for elsewhere,

2:29:42.300 --> 2:29:46.860
 and that Islamic law operates as the kind of judicial logic

2:29:46.860 --> 2:29:50.180
 for these punishments.

2:29:50.180 --> 2:29:52.700
 But letting these women kind of speak for themselves,

2:29:52.700 --> 2:29:53.540
 I mean, it's fascinating.

2:29:53.540 --> 2:29:55.100
 I mean, I don't want to get too much away,

2:29:55.100 --> 2:29:58.820
 but women make very interesting choices in this film

2:29:58.820 --> 2:30:00.300
 that land them in this predicament.

2:30:00.300 --> 2:30:04.100
 So they don't all profess innocence.

2:30:04.100 --> 2:30:06.980
 Some are like, I'm guilty, but they're guilty for reasons.

2:30:06.980 --> 2:30:09.180
 In one case, one woman is guilty, she's in prison

2:30:09.180 --> 2:30:12.100
 because it's a way to exert pressure on her fiancee

2:30:12.100 --> 2:30:14.580
 to finally marry her, you know?

2:30:14.580 --> 2:30:16.540
 So you get ethnicity, you get like, you know,

2:30:16.540 --> 2:30:18.500
 kind of Romeo and Juliet things

2:30:18.500 --> 2:30:20.580
 where their families don't like each other necessarily,

2:30:20.580 --> 2:30:21.980
 but they find each other.

2:30:21.980 --> 2:30:25.300
 You have questions of like, love, money, clothing,

2:30:25.300 --> 2:30:28.180
 furniture, it's beautiful.

2:30:28.180 --> 2:30:29.460
 And like, I mean, the parts with it,

2:30:29.460 --> 2:30:30.980
 I remember showing it in class,

2:30:30.980 --> 2:30:33.660
 there was a wonderful Afghan student who was a,

2:30:33.660 --> 2:30:35.900
 I think a Fulbright at the ed school at Stanford,

2:30:35.900 --> 2:30:37.660
 and she's a genius, she's amazing.

2:30:38.900 --> 2:30:41.460
 It was awkward for her because talking about young women

2:30:41.460 --> 2:30:44.500
 having sex and stuff, and it was just, it wasn't,

2:30:44.500 --> 2:30:46.780
 you know, the snapshot of Afghanistan that she wanted.

2:30:46.780 --> 2:30:47.700
 And obviously there's so much more,

2:30:47.700 --> 2:30:50.380
 they're great writers and, you know, musicians.

2:30:50.380 --> 2:30:52.260
 And I mean, you know, music is a huge thing.

2:30:52.260 --> 2:30:54.380
 I mean, poetry, all those things are great.

2:30:55.380 --> 2:30:57.500
 So she found it, you know, I hear you.

2:30:57.500 --> 2:30:59.100
 I mean, it's kind of a taboo subject,

2:30:59.100 --> 2:31:02.220
 but I thought the American students seeing it

2:31:02.220 --> 2:31:04.780
 really identified with these women

2:31:04.780 --> 2:31:05.700
 because they're just so real.

2:31:05.700 --> 2:31:08.580
 And so, you know, young people trying to find like,

2:31:08.580 --> 2:31:10.820
 I mean, relationships that are universal

2:31:11.820 --> 2:31:14.820
 and circumstances that are very difficult.

2:31:14.820 --> 2:31:16.820
 Love, love is universal.

2:31:16.820 --> 2:31:17.780
 Yeah, yeah, so it's, I mean,

2:31:17.780 --> 2:31:18.940
 we do have resources to humanize.

2:31:18.940 --> 2:31:20.980
 I mean, you know, some of your people will know

2:31:20.980 --> 2:31:23.780
 Khaled Hosseini, you know, he's an African American,

2:31:23.780 --> 2:31:25.660
 he's done his stuff, but there are,

2:31:25.660 --> 2:31:29.260
 there are a number of novelists and short story writers

2:31:29.260 --> 2:31:30.420
 who do cool things.

2:31:30.420 --> 2:31:33.300
 I think that another tragic aspect of this moment

2:31:33.300 --> 2:31:35.100
 is that those people have now pretty much

2:31:35.100 --> 2:31:36.180
 had to leave the country.

2:31:36.180 --> 2:31:39.940
 So there's a visual artist I would highlight for you

2:31:39.940 --> 2:31:44.940
 named Khadem Ali, who's a Hazara based in Australia.

2:31:44.940 --> 2:31:48.460
 He does extraordinary work in blending a tradition

2:31:48.460 --> 2:31:52.860
 of Persian miniatures with contemporary political commentary.

2:31:54.500 --> 2:31:56.020
 His work is between Australia and Afghanistan,

2:31:56.020 --> 2:31:57.340
 but he also, he had to flee.

2:31:57.340 --> 2:31:59.180
 I mean, he was doing some work in Kabul,

2:31:59.180 --> 2:32:04.180
 but it's a extraordinary kind of visual language

2:32:04.180 --> 2:32:06.620
 that he's adopted that has been shown all over the planet now.

2:32:06.620 --> 2:32:08.300
 He's got some of his work is in New York galleries,

2:32:08.300 --> 2:32:09.140
 is in Europe.

2:32:10.300 --> 2:32:11.140
 He's been shown in Australia,

2:32:11.140 --> 2:32:13.180
 but he talks about migration in a way

2:32:13.180 --> 2:32:16.380
 that puts Afghans and Hazaras at the center,

2:32:16.380 --> 2:32:20.180
 but it's totally universal about, you know,

2:32:20.180 --> 2:32:23.300
 our modern crisis of all the mains people

2:32:23.300 --> 2:32:24.860
 who were displaced across our planet.

2:32:24.860 --> 2:32:28.540
 And he attempts to kind of speak for some size of them

2:32:28.540 --> 2:32:30.500
 in a way that like everyone can get.

2:32:31.460 --> 2:32:32.820
 I mean, the visual imagery experts will know

2:32:32.820 --> 2:32:36.060
 that it's from, you know, like the Shah Naam,

2:32:36.060 --> 2:32:38.980
 like an ancient Persian epic that Iranians were attached to,

2:32:38.980 --> 2:32:41.660
 that Afghans are attached to, that people can quote,

2:32:41.660 --> 2:32:44.180
 you know, at length, that has mythical figures

2:32:44.180 --> 2:32:47.180
 of good and evil that kids grow up embodying.

2:32:47.180 --> 2:32:50.140
 They're named the names of the characters that are,

2:32:50.140 --> 2:32:52.340
 it's called, you know, the Book of Kings.

2:32:52.340 --> 2:32:53.700
 The heroes and villains are the staple

2:32:53.700 --> 2:32:58.700
 of conversation and poetry and, you know, like Russians,

2:32:59.460 --> 2:33:02.500
 I mean, the kind of, the resort to literary references

2:33:02.500 --> 2:33:04.460
 and speak is something that, you know,

2:33:04.460 --> 2:33:07.260
 Americans don't do, most West European countries don't do,

2:33:07.260 --> 2:33:09.260
 but the fact that everyone's got to know this character,

2:33:09.260 --> 2:33:10.860
 everyone knows this reference,

2:33:10.860 --> 2:33:15.860
 the wordplay, the linguistic finesse in multiple languages

2:33:16.220 --> 2:33:20.620
 is, you know, a major value of Afghan storytelling.

2:33:21.620 --> 2:33:25.340
 As an outsider, I'm scratching at the surface of the surface.

2:33:25.340 --> 2:33:26.180
 Yeah, but there's a depth to it.

2:33:26.180 --> 2:33:28.100
 It's just like, it is fascinating.

2:33:28.100 --> 2:33:29.060
 With the layers, yeah.

2:33:29.060 --> 2:33:31.660
 With the layers of Russian language that's.

2:33:31.660 --> 2:33:32.500
 Exactly.

2:33:32.500 --> 2:33:36.060
 The culture, it's a, I've been struggling,

2:33:36.060 --> 2:33:40.300
 and this is kind of the journey I'm embarking on

2:33:40.300 --> 2:33:43.180
 to convey to an American audience

2:33:43.180 --> 2:33:47.860
 what is lost in translation between Russian and English.

2:33:47.860 --> 2:33:51.540
 And it's very challenging in some of the great translators

2:33:51.540 --> 2:33:55.220
 of Dostoevsky, of Tolstoy, of Russian literature,

2:33:55.220 --> 2:33:56.700
 struggle with this deeply.

2:33:56.700 --> 2:34:01.260
 And they work, it's an art form just to convey that.

2:34:01.260 --> 2:34:03.780
 And it's amazing to hear that Afghanistan,

2:34:03.780 --> 2:34:06.700
 with a full mix of cultures that are there,

2:34:06.700 --> 2:34:10.980
 have the same kind of wit and humor and depth of intellect.

2:34:10.980 --> 2:34:13.100
 I mean, the humor thing is, that's, you know,

2:34:13.100 --> 2:34:14.100
 I'm so much of our visual imagery

2:34:14.100 --> 2:34:15.980
 is about like this sad place in Dower or whatever,

2:34:15.980 --> 2:34:18.540
 but the, I mean, socially, again,

2:34:18.540 --> 2:34:19.780
 I'm gonna engage in some stereotypes

2:34:19.780 --> 2:34:21.940
 about generalization stuff, but just the,

2:34:22.940 --> 2:34:25.220
 you know, the Afghan friends that I've come to

2:34:25.220 --> 2:34:28.380
 be close with and really love, I mean, the humor,

2:34:28.380 --> 2:34:31.340
 there's so much there of common stuff of like,

2:34:31.340 --> 2:34:33.340
 when I go to Ireland, it's one of my favorite places

2:34:33.340 --> 2:34:36.260
 and just like the, I feel a sense of pressure,

2:34:36.260 --> 2:34:38.020
 like the humor all around me at the time.

2:34:38.020 --> 2:34:40.580
 I mean, I feel like there's something between Ireland

2:34:40.580 --> 2:34:43.740
 and Russia with the humor stuff where it's like,

2:34:43.740 --> 2:34:46.220
 you've gotta be on your game if you wanna be, you know,

2:34:46.220 --> 2:34:51.220
 so it's, yeah, I feel like the intensity of conversation

2:34:52.140 --> 2:34:54.260
 in terms of, yeah, you have to be on your game

2:34:54.260 --> 2:34:55.980
 in terms of wit and so on.

2:34:55.980 --> 2:34:58.340
 I mean, you have to, there's certain people I have,

2:34:58.340 --> 2:34:59.620
 like when I talk on this podcast,

2:34:59.620 --> 2:35:02.620
 they're like that, certain people from the Jewish tradition

2:35:02.620 --> 2:35:05.460
 have that, like where the wit is just like,

2:35:05.460 --> 2:35:09.340
 okay, I have to, oh yeah, I really have to pay attention.

2:35:09.340 --> 2:35:12.380
 It's a game, it's like, you know what it feels like?

2:35:12.380 --> 2:35:14.660
 It feels like speed chess or something like that

2:35:14.660 --> 2:35:17.420
 and you really have to focus and play

2:35:17.420 --> 2:35:19.900
 and at the same time, there's body language in the,

2:35:19.900 --> 2:35:22.260
 and then there's a melancholy nature to it,

2:35:22.260 --> 2:35:23.860
 at least in the Russian side.

2:35:23.860 --> 2:35:25.780
 The whole thing is just a beautiful mess.

2:35:25.780 --> 2:35:27.060
 Yeah, I mean, there's a funny TikTok video

2:35:27.060 --> 2:35:29.620
 that went around that I got from like some Afghan

2:35:29.620 --> 2:35:33.100
 acquaintances that was a, that he's an Irish comedian

2:35:33.100 --> 2:35:35.820
 kind of highlighting, you know,

2:35:35.820 --> 2:35:38.060
 kind of Irish and German national stereotypes

2:35:38.060 --> 2:35:39.740
 around hospitality.

2:35:39.740 --> 2:35:41.540
 And this Afghan woman said, you know,

2:35:41.540 --> 2:35:44.980
 I didn't know that the Irish were just white Afghans

2:35:44.980 --> 2:35:46.260
 because the whole, like, you know, the hospitality,

2:35:46.260 --> 2:35:48.380
 like politics of like, of refusal.

2:35:48.380 --> 2:35:51.140
 You know, you don't take something

2:35:51.140 --> 2:35:52.180
 that's offered to you the first time.

2:35:52.180 --> 2:35:56.780
 You don't, I mean, it's the culture of receiving a guest.

2:35:56.780 --> 2:35:59.260
 You know, that's, you know, Americans aren't,

2:35:59.260 --> 2:36:01.420
 I mean, that's not, you know, that's not always,

2:36:01.420 --> 2:36:02.940
 I mean, the different, the regional cultures

2:36:02.940 --> 2:36:03.780
 where that's the thing, there's whatever,

2:36:03.780 --> 2:36:06.940
 but it's, I mean, the kind of like generosity

2:36:06.940 --> 2:36:09.380
 and the kind of, you know, that's real.

2:36:09.380 --> 2:36:11.420
 I mean, that's, and that's a cool thing.

2:36:11.420 --> 2:36:12.260
 And that's amazing.

2:36:12.260 --> 2:36:13.820
 That's, you know, the food, I mean, going off

2:36:13.820 --> 2:36:17.500
 just the superficial things, but all of that,

2:36:17.500 --> 2:36:22.500
 the warmth of hospitality and of wit and humanity.

2:36:22.500 --> 2:36:25.780
 I mean, that's what we don't see viewing the place

2:36:25.780 --> 2:36:27.660
 just through war and geopolitics

2:36:27.660 --> 2:36:29.100
 and the moving pieces of the map and stuff.

2:36:29.100 --> 2:36:31.700
 And that's hard to see when, you know,

2:36:31.700 --> 2:36:34.900
 there are gaps in language and in religious tradition

2:36:34.900 --> 2:36:35.820
 and all that stuff.

2:36:35.820 --> 2:36:38.380
 And then, you know, being open to the fact

2:36:38.380 --> 2:36:41.060
 that people do things differently, you know,

2:36:41.060 --> 2:36:43.500
 and it's, and the gender dimension there is important,

2:36:43.500 --> 2:36:44.340
 right?

2:36:44.340 --> 2:36:47.540
 They're kind of, you know, arguably each culture

2:36:47.540 --> 2:36:49.140
 has a kind of gender dynamic that's different.

2:36:49.140 --> 2:36:50.940
 And so I think it's helpful to have humility

2:36:50.940 --> 2:36:53.100
 in thinking that some Afghans

2:36:53.100 --> 2:36:55.660
 will do some things differently, you know.

2:36:55.660 --> 2:36:58.580
 But then you'll also have Afghans who say,

2:36:58.580 --> 2:36:59.820
 every woman should be educated.

2:36:59.820 --> 2:37:01.260
 Everyone should work and so on and so on.

2:37:01.260 --> 2:37:03.460
 So there's no, there's no single way of, yeah.

2:37:03.460 --> 2:37:06.060
 And there is a gender dynamic in Russia too.

2:37:06.060 --> 2:37:08.260
 We need to be respectful of that.

2:37:08.260 --> 2:37:10.100
 And that's not always what it looks like at first.

2:37:10.100 --> 2:37:10.940
 Yeah, exactly.

2:37:10.940 --> 2:37:11.780
 There's layers.

2:37:11.780 --> 2:37:12.600
 Where power is.

2:37:12.600 --> 2:37:14.300
 I mean, that's definitely, I don't know, yeah.

2:37:14.300 --> 2:37:16.060
 Yeah, that's a whole nother conversation

2:37:16.060 --> 2:37:17.180
 where the power is.

2:37:17.180 --> 2:37:18.220
 Yeah.

2:37:18.220 --> 2:37:20.620
 Rumi, the 13th century Persian poet

2:37:20.620 --> 2:37:23.980
 who was born on the land that is now Afghanistan.

2:37:23.980 --> 2:37:26.940
 Is there something in his words that speaks to you

2:37:26.940 --> 2:37:31.420
 about the spirit of the Afghan people?

2:37:31.420 --> 2:37:33.060
 I mean, everyone owns Rumi, I guess I'd say.

2:37:33.060 --> 2:37:34.060
 I mean, that's gonna get me in trouble

2:37:34.060 --> 2:37:36.060
 with certain Afghan fans of Rumi

2:37:36.060 --> 2:37:38.740
 who wanna see him as an Afghan.

2:37:38.740 --> 2:37:39.580
 I would say.

2:37:40.500 --> 2:37:42.020
 Are they proud of Rumi?

2:37:42.020 --> 2:37:42.860
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:37:42.860 --> 2:37:44.020
 Do they see him as an Afghan?

2:37:44.020 --> 2:37:44.860
 Do they?

2:37:44.860 --> 2:37:46.180
 Yeah, I mean, it depends.

2:37:46.180 --> 2:37:49.860
 I mean, some people will be militant and say,

2:37:49.860 --> 2:37:51.100
 you know, the Iranian's gonna have him.

2:37:51.100 --> 2:37:51.980
 He's ours.

2:37:53.500 --> 2:37:55.940
 But they'll also say, you know, he's,

2:37:55.940 --> 2:37:57.140
 I mean, you can say, I mean, again,

2:37:57.140 --> 2:37:57.980
 he's like a Rorschach blot.

2:37:57.980 --> 2:38:00.900
 I mean, he's a Sufi, he's a Muslim,

2:38:00.900 --> 2:38:04.140
 he's a Central Asian, he's Iranian, he's Afghan,

2:38:04.980 --> 2:38:05.940
 he's a Turk.

2:38:05.940 --> 2:38:06.780
 I'm trying to think of the analogy,

2:38:06.780 --> 2:38:08.940
 but he's something special to everyone.

2:38:08.940 --> 2:38:11.060
 So I guess I would not walk into that conversation

2:38:11.060 --> 2:38:12.700
 and claim that he's one or another,

2:38:12.700 --> 2:38:13.540
 but it's a cool thing.

2:38:13.540 --> 2:38:15.860
 I mean, it's the, but I'm glad you brought that up

2:38:15.860 --> 2:38:20.700
 because that's a good way of seeing something that Afghans,

2:38:20.700 --> 2:38:22.260
 I mean, we live in our country in Afghanistan

2:38:22.260 --> 2:38:24.700
 and say, okay, Rumi's everyone, you know,

2:38:24.700 --> 2:38:26.420
 Madonna helped make him famous in the United States,

2:38:26.420 --> 2:38:27.860
 you know, for better, for worse.

2:38:27.860 --> 2:38:29.180
 They used to sell stuff at Starbucks

2:38:29.180 --> 2:38:32.020
 and that's all complicated and embarrassing.

2:38:32.020 --> 2:38:35.140
 And his translations are very much disputed

2:38:35.140 --> 2:38:36.420
 where you have people be like,

2:38:36.420 --> 2:38:37.780
 there's some awful Rumi translations.

2:38:37.780 --> 2:38:40.300
 And there are, there are also a lot of,

2:38:40.300 --> 2:38:41.140
 speaking of the internet,

2:38:41.140 --> 2:38:44.020
 there are lots of fake Rumi quotes, you know,

2:38:44.020 --> 2:38:46.100
 like Rumi said, always be your best.

2:38:46.100 --> 2:38:48.620
 Like, Rumi didn't say that, you know, that was, you know,

2:38:48.620 --> 2:38:49.980
 I mean, that's kind of slow stuff like that.

2:38:49.980 --> 2:38:52.380
 But the cool thing is like, I mean,

2:38:52.380 --> 2:38:56.420
 I think you can read Rumi as a religious thinker,

2:38:56.420 --> 2:38:59.060
 but you can also, you know, read Rumi as,

2:39:00.500 --> 2:39:01.420
 you know, in an Islamic sense,

2:39:01.420 --> 2:39:03.340
 but you can also read him as a kind of spiritualist, right?

2:39:03.340 --> 2:39:05.260
 As someone who, or an ethicist or moralist.

2:39:05.260 --> 2:39:09.420
 And so I think that's, I like the lens of Rumi

2:39:09.420 --> 2:39:14.100
 as a gateway to Afghan ecumenism and cosmolitanism.

2:39:14.100 --> 2:39:16.420
 You know, the theme I keep emphasizing of,

2:39:16.420 --> 2:39:19.220
 of meeting actual Afghans who were actually,

2:39:19.220 --> 2:39:21.380
 you know, fluent in Russian, fluent in German,

2:39:21.380 --> 2:39:24.420
 fluent in Turkish, they know Dari, they know Pashto.

2:39:26.100 --> 2:39:28.460
 They've gone to university or sometimes they haven't.

2:39:28.460 --> 2:39:30.300
 And yet, I mean, they are,

2:39:30.300 --> 2:39:34.260
 I like the category of the popular intellectual,

2:39:34.260 --> 2:39:36.060
 you know, the intellectual who isn't,

2:39:36.060 --> 2:39:37.940
 isn't formally educated necessarily.

2:39:37.940 --> 2:39:39.500
 Although of course that's represented too,

2:39:39.500 --> 2:39:41.100
 especially increasingly now with the generation

2:39:41.100 --> 2:39:42.540
 of going to university all over the world,

2:39:42.540 --> 2:39:44.540
 you know, Stanford, MIT, everywhere.

2:39:45.500 --> 2:39:47.220
 Afghans are well represented there.

2:39:47.220 --> 2:39:50.660
 But just being, I don't have any kind of worldly knowledge

2:39:50.660 --> 2:39:54.700
 that is not limited to a province, to a village, to a hamlet.

2:39:54.700 --> 2:39:58.140
 But sometimes it is, but sometimes it's not.

2:39:58.140 --> 2:40:02.140
 Because of, again, not because of some fairy tale story

2:40:02.140 --> 2:40:06.980
 of curiosity wandering the globe out of, you know,

2:40:06.980 --> 2:40:10.220
 some sense of privilege, but out of necessity,

2:40:10.220 --> 2:40:11.780
 out of survival of having to adapt.

2:40:11.780 --> 2:40:14.780
 And it's really extraordinary that, I mean,

2:40:14.780 --> 2:40:16.180
 also let me think about like professions,

2:40:16.180 --> 2:40:20.460
 so like, you know, ask an Afghan, you know,

2:40:20.460 --> 2:40:22.340
 what does he or she do for a living?

2:40:22.340 --> 2:40:23.460
 And what have they done in the past?

2:40:23.460 --> 2:40:25.060
 I mean, the answers one gets,

2:40:25.060 --> 2:40:30.060
 shoe salesman, task cop drivers, surgeons, all in one guy.

2:40:30.900 --> 2:40:31.740
 Yeah.

2:40:31.740 --> 2:40:33.540
 I mean, that's not just Afghan,

2:40:33.540 --> 2:40:35.340
 but that's, you know, that's very common.

2:40:35.340 --> 2:40:37.420
 But it's also Russia is the same.

2:40:37.420 --> 2:40:39.980
 I think it's whenever there's complexities

2:40:39.980 --> 2:40:43.140
 to the economic system and the short term

2:40:43.140 --> 2:40:46.300
 and the long term history of how the country develops.

2:40:46.300 --> 2:40:49.980
 And it's basically the people figuring out their way

2:40:49.980 --> 2:40:54.180
 around a mess of a country politically,

2:40:54.180 --> 2:40:59.180
 but a beautiful, flourishing culture and humanity.

2:40:59.340 --> 2:41:01.420
 And that creates super interesting people.

2:41:01.420 --> 2:41:02.620
 Yeah, yeah.

2:41:02.620 --> 2:41:05.660
 So we can often see, okay, there's Taliban, there's war,

2:41:05.660 --> 2:41:09.620
 there's economic malfunction,

2:41:09.620 --> 2:41:11.980
 there's harboring of terrorists, there's opium trade,

2:41:11.980 --> 2:41:13.860
 all that kind of stuff, but there's humans there

2:41:13.860 --> 2:41:16.780
 with deep intellectual lies.

2:41:17.980 --> 2:41:21.220
 And like, I love the movie, Love Crimes.

2:41:21.220 --> 2:41:25.740
 And the same kind of hopes, fears, and desire to love

2:41:25.740 --> 2:41:27.740
 the old Romeo and Juliet story.

2:41:27.740 --> 2:41:30.000
 And I think Rumi to me represents that.

2:41:31.460 --> 2:41:36.460
 The wit, the intelligence, but also the just eloquent

2:41:37.180 --> 2:41:40.860
 and just beautiful representation of humanity of love.

2:41:40.860 --> 2:41:44.700
 Some of the best quotes about love are from him,

2:41:44.700 --> 2:41:48.540
 half of them fake, half of them real, but.

2:41:48.540 --> 2:41:49.380
 The best ones are real, right?

2:41:49.380 --> 2:41:52.020
 The best ones are real, the best ones are real.

2:41:52.020 --> 2:41:53.860
 Robert, this was an incredible conversation.

2:41:53.860 --> 2:41:54.700
 Oh, thank you for having us.

2:41:54.700 --> 2:41:59.380
 Thank you for the tour of Afghanistan

2:41:59.380 --> 2:42:04.380
 and making me, making us realize that there's much more

2:42:04.900 --> 2:42:09.020
 to this country than what we may think.

2:42:09.020 --> 2:42:13.500
 It's a beautiful country and it's full of beautiful people.

2:42:13.500 --> 2:42:15.020
 You made me think about a lot of new things too,

2:42:15.020 --> 2:42:17.460
 so it was definitely, definitely great online too,

2:42:17.460 --> 2:42:19.280
 so thank you so much.

2:42:19.280 --> 2:42:20.740
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:42:20.740 --> 2:42:22.000
 with Robert Cruz.

 And now, let me leave you with some words

2:42:27.960 --> 2:42:29.760
 from Winston Churchill.

2:42:29.760 --> 2:42:34.760
 "'History will be kind to me, for I intend to write it.'"

2:42:34.760 --> 2:42:38.440
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
