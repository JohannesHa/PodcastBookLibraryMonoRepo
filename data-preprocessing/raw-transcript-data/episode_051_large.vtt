00:00.000 --> 00:03.380
 The following is a conversation with David Newman.

00:03.380 --> 00:06.120
 She's the Apollo Program Professor at MIT

00:06.120 --> 00:08.960
 and the former Deputy Administrator of NASA

00:08.960 --> 00:10.720
 and has been a principal investigator

00:10.720 --> 00:13.160
 on four space flight missions.

00:13.160 --> 00:15.060
 Her research interests are in aerospace

00:15.060 --> 00:18.240
 biomedical engineering, investigating human performance

00:18.240 --> 00:20.400
 in varying gravity environments.

00:20.400 --> 00:23.360
 She has designed and engineered and built

00:23.360 --> 00:25.680
 some incredible space suit technology,

00:25.680 --> 00:29.600
 namely the BioSuit that we talk about in this conversation.

00:29.600 --> 00:32.640
 Due to some scheduling challenges on both our parts,

00:32.640 --> 00:34.920
 we only had about 40 minutes together.

00:34.920 --> 00:37.120
 And in true engineering style, she said,

00:37.120 --> 00:41.280
 I talk fast, you pick the best questions, let's get it done.

00:41.280 --> 00:42.320
 And we did.

00:42.320 --> 00:43.880
 It was a fascinating conversation

00:43.880 --> 00:47.360
 about space exploration and the future of spacesuits.

00:47.360 --> 00:50.520
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.800
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

00:52.800 --> 00:56.160

00:56.160 --> 00:58.200
 or simply connect with me on Twitter

00:58.200 --> 01:02.240
 at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

01:02.240 --> 01:05.560
 For the first time, this show is presented by Cash App,

01:05.560 --> 01:08.060
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

01:08.060 --> 01:11.080
 Cash App is the easiest way to send money to your friends.

01:11.080 --> 01:12.840
 And it is also the easiest way

01:12.840 --> 01:15.160
 to buy, sell, and deposit Bitcoin.

01:15.160 --> 01:17.120
 Most Bitcoin exchanges take days

01:17.120 --> 01:19.520
 for a bank transfer to become investable.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.760
 Through Cash App, it takes seconds.

01:21.760 --> 01:25.360
 Invest as little as $1, and now you own Bitcoin.

01:25.360 --> 01:27.280
 I have several conversations about Bitcoin

01:27.280 --> 01:29.060
 coming up on this podcast.

01:29.060 --> 01:30.640
 Decentralized digital currency

01:30.640 --> 01:33.440
 is a fascinating technology in general to explore,

01:33.440 --> 01:37.680
 both at the technical and the philosophical level.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.560
 Cash App is also the easiest way

01:39.560 --> 01:43.120
 to try and grow your money with our new investing feature.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.760
 Unlike investing tools that force you

01:44.760 --> 01:46.620
 to buy entire shares of stock,

01:46.620 --> 01:50.000
 Cash App, amazingly, lets you instantly invest

01:50.000 --> 01:52.240
 as little or as much as you want.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.320
 Some stocks in the market are hundreds,

01:54.320 --> 01:56.320
 if not thousands of dollars per share,

01:56.320 --> 02:01.120
 and now you can still own a piece with as little as $1.

02:01.120 --> 02:04.280
 Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,

02:04.280 --> 02:08.160
 a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.960
 I'm also excited to be working with Cash App

02:10.960 --> 02:14.120
 to support one of my favorite organizations called First,

02:14.120 --> 02:16.280
 which is best known for their first robotics

02:16.280 --> 02:19.760
 and Lego competitions that seeks to inspire young students

02:19.760 --> 02:23.560
 in engineering and technology fields all over the world.

02:23.560 --> 02:27.800
 That's over 110 countries, 660,000 students,

02:27.800 --> 02:30.320
 300,000 mentors and volunteers,

02:30.320 --> 02:33.360
 and a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,

02:33.360 --> 02:35.080
 which means the donated money

02:35.080 --> 02:37.920
 is used to maximum effectiveness.

03:06.960 --> 03:10.800
 And now, here's my conversation with Deva Newman.

03:11.800 --> 03:16.040
 You circumnavigated the globe on boat,

03:16.040 --> 03:17.720
 so let's look back in history.

03:17.720 --> 03:21.280
 500 years ago, Ferdinand Magellan's crew

03:21.280 --> 03:23.460
 was first to circumnavigate the globe,

03:24.480 --> 03:27.760
 but he died, which I think people don't know,

03:27.760 --> 03:32.760
 like halfway through, and so did 242 of the 260 sailors

03:32.880 --> 03:35.320
 that took that three year journey.

03:35.320 --> 03:38.400
 What do you think it was like for that crew at that time

03:38.400 --> 03:43.160
 heading out into the unknown to face probably likely death?

03:43.160 --> 03:46.960
 Do you think they were filled with fear, with excitement?

03:46.960 --> 03:50.040
 Probably not fear, I think in all of exploration,

03:50.040 --> 03:53.560
 the challenge and the unknown, so probably wonderment.

03:53.560 --> 03:57.160
 And then just when you really are sailing the world's oceans,

03:59.160 --> 04:01.580
 you have extreme weather of all kinds.

04:01.580 --> 04:03.800
 When we were circumnavigating, it was challenging,

04:03.800 --> 04:07.340
 a new dynamic, you really appreciate Mother Earth,

04:07.340 --> 04:08.680
 you appreciate the winds and the waves,

04:08.680 --> 04:10.960
 so back to Magellan and his crew,

04:10.960 --> 04:15.240
 since they really didn't have a three dimensional map

04:15.240 --> 04:18.720
 of the globe, of the Earth when they went out,

04:18.720 --> 04:20.380
 just probably looking over the horizon thinking,

04:20.380 --> 04:21.400
 what's there, what's there?

04:21.400 --> 04:24.760
 So I would say the challenge that had to be really important

04:24.760 --> 04:26.800
 in terms of the team dynamics and that leadership

04:26.800 --> 04:29.840
 had to be incredibly important, team dynamics,

04:29.840 --> 04:32.520
 how do you keep people focused on the mission?

04:32.520 --> 04:34.080
 So you think the psychology, that's interesting,

04:34.080 --> 04:36.360
 there's probably echoes of that in the space exploration

04:36.360 --> 04:37.660
 stuff we'll talk about.

04:37.660 --> 04:41.760
 So the psychology of the dynamics between the human beings

04:41.760 --> 04:43.400
 on the mission is important?

04:43.400 --> 04:46.880
 Absolutely, for a Mars mission, it's lots of challenges,

04:46.880 --> 04:48.840
 technology, but since I specialize

04:48.840 --> 04:52.600
 in keeping my astronauts alive, the psychosocial issues,

04:52.600 --> 04:55.800
 the psychology of psychosocial team dynamics, leadership,

04:55.800 --> 04:58.160
 that's, you know, we're all people, so that's gonna be,

04:58.160 --> 05:01.500
 that's always a huge impact, one of the top three,

05:01.500 --> 05:04.600
 I think, of any isolated, confined environment,

05:04.600 --> 05:07.920
 any mission that is really pretty extreme.

05:07.920 --> 05:11.160
 So your Twitter handle is devaexplorer,

05:11.160 --> 05:13.840
 so when did you first fall in love with the idea

05:13.840 --> 05:14.800
 of exploration?

05:14.800 --> 05:17.440
 Ah, that's a great question, you know, maybe as long

05:17.440 --> 05:19.680
 as I can remember, as I grew up in Montana

05:19.680 --> 05:22.120
 in the Rocky Mountains and Helena in the capital,

05:22.120 --> 05:25.460
 and so literally, you know, Mount Helena was my backyard,

05:25.460 --> 05:28.800
 was right up there, so exploring, being in the mountains,

05:28.800 --> 05:31.440
 looking at caves, just running around,

05:31.440 --> 05:36.440
 but always being in nature, so since my earliest memories,

05:36.520 --> 05:40.100
 I, you know, think of myself as kind of exploring

05:40.100 --> 05:44.000
 the natural beauty of the Rocky Mountains where I grew up.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.200
 So exploration is not limited to any domain,

05:46.200 --> 05:49.160
 it's just anything, so the natural domain of any kind,

05:49.160 --> 05:51.720
 so going out to the woods into a place you haven't been,

05:51.720 --> 05:52.960
 it's all exploration.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.380
 I think so, yeah, I have a pretty all encompassing

05:55.380 --> 05:56.800
 definition of exploration.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.200
 So what about space exploration?

05:58.200 --> 06:00.900
 When were you first captivated by the idea

06:00.900 --> 06:05.160
 that we little humans could venture out into the space,

06:05.160 --> 06:06.720
 into the great unknown of space?

06:06.720 --> 06:08.440
 So it's a great year to talk about that,

06:08.440 --> 06:10.680
 the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11,

06:10.680 --> 06:12.720
 as I was alive during Apollo,

06:12.720 --> 06:14.840
 and specifically Apollo 11, I was five years old,

06:14.840 --> 06:19.280
 and I distinctly remember that, I remember that humanity,

06:19.280 --> 06:21.400
 I'm sure I probably didn't know their names at the time,

06:21.400 --> 06:23.560
 you know, there's Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin,

06:23.560 --> 06:26.560
 and never forget Michael Collins in orbit,

06:26.560 --> 06:30.560
 you know, those three men, you know,

06:30.560 --> 06:32.800
 doing something that just seemed impossible,

06:32.800 --> 06:36.920
 seemed impossible a decade earlier, even a year earlier,

06:36.920 --> 06:39.580
 but so the Apollo program really inspired me,

06:39.580 --> 06:42.640
 and then I think it actually just taught me to dream,

06:42.640 --> 06:46.480
 to any impossible mission could be possible

06:46.480 --> 06:49.180
 with enough focus, and I'm sure you need some luck,

06:49.180 --> 06:50.760
 but you definitely need the leadership,

06:50.760 --> 06:53.160
 you need the focus of the mission,

06:53.160 --> 06:55.320
 so since an early age, I thought,

06:55.320 --> 06:57.200
 of course, people, it should be interplanetary,

06:57.200 --> 06:58.520
 of course, people, we need people on Earth,

06:58.520 --> 07:00.960
 and we're gonna have people exploring space as well.

07:00.960 --> 07:04.280
 So that seemed obvious, even at that age, of course.

07:04.280 --> 07:07.080
 It opened it up, before we saw men on the moon,

07:07.080 --> 07:10.120
 it wasn't obvious to me at all, but once we understood

07:10.120 --> 07:12.720
 that yes, absolutely, astronauts, that's what they do,

07:12.720 --> 07:14.080
 they explore, they go into space,

07:14.080 --> 07:16.500
 and they land on other planets or moons.

07:17.360 --> 07:20.680
 So again, maybe a romanticized philosophical question,

07:20.680 --> 07:22.680
 but when you look up at the stars,

07:23.840 --> 07:28.520
 knowing that, you know, there's at least 100 billion

07:28.520 --> 07:30.420
 of them in the Milky Way galaxy, right,

07:30.420 --> 07:34.760
 so we're really a small speck in this giant thing

07:34.760 --> 07:36.600
 that's the visible universe,

07:36.600 --> 07:40.280
 how does that make you feel about our efforts here?

07:40.280 --> 07:42.800
 I love the perspective, I love that perspective,

07:42.800 --> 07:44.660
 I always open my public talks

07:44.660 --> 07:46.760
 with a big Hubble Space Telescope image,

07:46.760 --> 07:48.280
 looking out into, you mentioned just now,

07:48.280 --> 07:49.840
 the solar system, the Milky Way,

07:49.840 --> 07:52.040
 because I think it's really important to know

07:52.040 --> 07:53.880
 that we're just a small, pale, blue dot,

07:53.880 --> 07:56.700
 we're really fortunate, we're on the best planet by far,

07:56.700 --> 07:58.560
 life is fantastic here.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.000
 That we know of, you're confident

08:00.000 --> 08:01.040
 this is the best planet.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.440
 I'm pretty sure it's the best planet,

08:02.440 --> 08:03.800
 the best planet that we know of.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.640
 I mean, I searched my researches, you know,

08:05.640 --> 08:08.040
 in mission worlds, and when will we find life?

08:08.040 --> 08:10.220
 I think actually probably the next decade,

08:10.220 --> 08:11.780
 we find probably past life,

08:11.780 --> 08:14.560
 probably the evidence of past life on Mars, let's say.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.320
 You think there was once life on Mars,

08:17.320 --> 08:19.660
 or do you think there's currently?

08:19.660 --> 08:23.180
 I'm more comfortable saying probably 3.5 billion years ago,

08:23.180 --> 08:24.880
 feel pretty confident there was life on Mars,

08:24.880 --> 08:27.540
 just because then it had an electromagnetic shield,

08:27.540 --> 08:30.800
 it had an atmosphere, has wonderful gravity level,

08:30.800 --> 08:34.360
 three HGs, fantastic, you know, you're all super human,

08:34.360 --> 08:35.800
 we can all slam dunk a basketball,

08:35.800 --> 08:38.580
 I mean, it's gonna be fun to play sports on Mars.

08:38.580 --> 08:40.800
 So I think we'll find past, no, fossilized,

08:40.800 --> 08:43.400
 probably the evidence of past life on Mars.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.480
 Currently, that's okay, we need the next decade,

08:45.480 --> 08:47.600
 but the evidence is mounting for sure.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.880
 We do have the organics, we're finding organics,

08:49.880 --> 08:52.400
 we have water, seasonal water on Mars.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.680
 We used to just know about the ice caps,

08:54.680 --> 08:55.600
 you know, North and South Pole,

08:55.600 --> 08:57.200
 now we have seasonal water.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.320
 We do have the building blocks for life on Mars.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.560
 We really need to dig down into the soil,

09:02.560 --> 09:04.520
 because everything on the top surface is radiated,

09:04.520 --> 09:08.040
 but once we find down, will we see any life forms?

09:08.040 --> 09:08.880
 Will we see any bugs?

09:08.880 --> 09:11.180
 I leave it open as a possibility,

09:11.180 --> 09:13.360
 but I feel pretty certain that past life,

09:13.360 --> 09:15.960
 or fossilized life forms, we'll find.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.360
 And then we have to get to all these ocean worlds,

09:18.360 --> 09:21.380
 these beautiful moons of other planets,

09:21.380 --> 09:22.620
 since we know they have water,

09:22.620 --> 09:26.920
 and we're looking for some simple search for life,

09:26.920 --> 09:28.640
 follow the water, carbon based life,

09:28.640 --> 09:29.960
 that's the only life we know.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.680
 There could be other life forms that we don't know about,

09:31.680 --> 09:33.680
 but it's hard to search for them, because we don't know.

09:33.680 --> 09:36.160
 So in our search for life in the solar system,

09:36.160 --> 09:39.120
 it's definitely search, follow the water,

09:39.120 --> 09:41.200
 and look for the building blocks of life.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.460
 So you think in the next decade,

09:42.460 --> 09:45.360
 we might see hints of past life, or even current life?

09:45.360 --> 09:46.720
 I think so, that's it.

09:46.720 --> 09:47.560
 Pretty optimistic.

09:47.560 --> 09:48.380
 I love the optimism.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.220
 I'm pretty optimistic.

09:49.220 --> 09:50.040
 Do humans have to be involved,

09:50.040 --> 09:52.640
 or can this be robots and rovers and?

09:52.640 --> 09:54.120
 Probably teams, I mean, we've been at it,

09:54.120 --> 09:55.840
 on Mars in particular, 50 years.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.720
 We've been exploring Mars for 50 years, great data, right?

09:58.720 --> 10:01.000
 Our images of Mars today are phenomenal.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.400
 Now we know how Mars lost its atmosphere.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.320
 We're starting to know,

10:04.320 --> 10:07.120
 because of the lack of the electromagnetic shield.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.120
 We know about the water on Mars.

10:08.120 --> 10:10.680
 So we've been studying 50 years with our robots,

10:10.680 --> 10:11.640
 we still haven't found it.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.880
 So I think once we have a human mission there,

10:13.880 --> 10:15.000
 we just accelerate things.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.520
 But it's always humans and our rovers and robots together.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.920
 But we just have to think that 50 years,

10:19.920 --> 10:23.000
 we've been looking at Mars, and taking images,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.080
 and doing the best science that we can.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.480
 People need to realize Mars is really far away.

10:27.480 --> 10:28.720
 It's really hard to get to.

10:28.720 --> 10:31.120
 You know, this is extreme, extreme exploration.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.440
 We mentioned Magellan first,

10:32.440 --> 10:35.480
 or all of the wonderful explorers and sailors of the past,

10:35.480 --> 10:39.140
 which kind of are lots of my inspiration for exploration.

10:39.140 --> 10:40.600
 Mars is a different ball game.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.680
 I mean, it's eight months to get there,

10:42.680 --> 10:44.240
 year and a half to get home.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.680
 I mean, it's really extreme.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.800
 The harsh environment in all kinds of ways.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.880
 But the kind of organisms we might be able to see

10:50.880 --> 10:54.840
 hints of on Mars are kind of microorganisms perhaps.

10:54.840 --> 10:55.680
 Do you think?

10:55.680 --> 10:56.500
 Yeah, and remember that humans,

10:56.500 --> 10:57.900
 we're kind of, you know, we're hosts, right?

10:57.900 --> 11:00.840
 We're hosts to all of our bacteria and viruses, right?

11:00.840 --> 11:02.080
 Do you think it's a big leap

11:02.080 --> 11:06.200
 from the viruses and the bacteria to us humans?

11:07.040 --> 11:10.460
 Put another way, do you think on all those moons,

11:10.460 --> 11:13.240
 beautiful, wet moons that you mentioned,

11:13.240 --> 11:15.840
 you think there's intelligent life out there?

11:15.840 --> 11:16.680
 I hope so.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.600
 I mean, that's the hope, but you know,

11:18.600 --> 11:21.000
 we don't have the scientific evidence for that now.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.440
 I think all the evidence we have in terms of life existing

11:24.440 --> 11:26.000
 is much more compelling again,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.360
 because we have the building blocks of life now.

11:28.360 --> 11:32.920
 When that life turns into intelligence, that's a big unknown.

11:32.920 --> 11:33.880
 If we ever meet,

11:33.880 --> 11:37.180
 do you think we would be able to find a common language?

11:37.180 --> 11:38.080
 I hope so.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.080
 We haven't met yet.

11:39.080 --> 11:42.000
 It's just so far, I mean, do physics just play a role here?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.440
 Look at all these exoplanets, 6,000 exoplanets.

11:44.440 --> 11:46.840
 I mean, even the couple dozen Earth like planets

11:46.840 --> 11:50.480
 that are exoplanets that really look like habitable planets.

11:50.480 --> 11:51.480
 These are very Earth like.

11:51.480 --> 11:53.940
 They look like they have all the building blocks.

11:53.940 --> 11:54.800
 I can't wait to get there.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.800
 The only thing is they're 10 to 100 light years away.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.200
 So scientifically, we know they're there.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.540
 We know that they're habitable.

12:01.540 --> 12:04.000
 They have, you know, everything going from, right?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.840
 Like, you know, we call them in the Goldilocks zone,

12:05.840 --> 12:06.940
 not too hot, not too cold,

12:06.940 --> 12:10.600
 just perfect for habitability for life.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.240
 But now the reality is if they're 10 at the best

12:13.240 --> 12:15.700
 to 100 to thousands of light years away,

12:17.020 --> 12:18.600
 so what's out there?

12:18.600 --> 12:20.960
 But I just can't think that we're not the only ones.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.280
 So absolutely life, life in the universe,

12:23.280 --> 12:25.840
 probably intelligent life as well.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.000
 Do you think there needs to be fundamental revolutions

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
 in how we, the tools we use to travel through space

12:32.000 --> 12:35.040
 in order for us to venture outside of our solar system?

12:35.040 --> 12:38.800
 Or do you think the ways, the rockets,

12:38.800 --> 12:41.680
 the ideas we have now, the engineering ideas we have now

12:41.680 --> 12:43.120
 will be enough to venture out?

12:43.120 --> 12:44.000
 Well, that's a good question.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.120
 Right now, you know, cause again, speed of light is a limit.

12:47.120 --> 12:49.000
 We don't have a warp speed warp drive

12:49.000 --> 12:51.880
 to explore our solar system, to get to Mars,

12:51.880 --> 12:53.560
 to explore all the planets.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.720
 Then we need a technology push,

12:55.720 --> 12:57.680
 but technology push here is just advanced propulsion.

12:57.680 --> 13:00.160
 It'd be great if I could get humans to Mars

13:00.160 --> 13:02.460
 and say, you know, three to four months, not eight months.

13:02.460 --> 13:04.560
 I mean, half the time, 50% reduction.

13:04.560 --> 13:08.120
 That's great in terms of safety and wellness of the crew.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.600
 Orbital mechanic, but physics rules,

13:09.600 --> 13:11.320
 you know, orbital mechanics is still there.

13:11.320 --> 13:14.260
 Physics rules, we can't defy physics.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.100
 I love that.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.180
 So invent a new physics.

13:16.180 --> 13:17.280
 I mean, look at quantum, you know,

13:17.280 --> 13:18.240
 look at quantum theory.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.080
 So you never know.

13:19.080 --> 13:21.280
 Exactly, I mean, we are always learning.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.920
 So we definitely don't know all the physics that exist too,

13:23.920 --> 13:27.000
 but we're, we still have to, it's not science fiction.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.200
 You know, we still have to pay attention to physics

13:29.200 --> 13:32.400
 in terms of our speed of travel for space flight.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.880
 So you were the deputy administrator of NASA

13:34.880 --> 13:37.220
 and during the Obama administration,

13:37.220 --> 13:39.560
 there's a current Artemis program

13:39.560 --> 13:41.320
 that's working on a crewed mission to the moon

13:41.320 --> 13:43.440
 and then perhaps to Mars.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.520
 What are you excited about there?

13:46.520 --> 13:48.120
 What are your thoughts on this program?

13:48.120 --> 13:49.920
 What are the biggest challenges do you think

13:49.920 --> 13:53.640
 of getting to the moon, of landing to the moon once again,

13:53.640 --> 13:57.400
 and then the big step to Mars?

13:57.400 --> 14:00.400
 Well, I love, you know, the moon program now, Artemis.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.520
 It is definitely, we've been in low earth orbit.

14:02.520 --> 14:03.600
 I love low earth orbit too,

14:03.600 --> 14:05.880
 but I just always look at it as three phases.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.980
 So low earth orbit where we've been 40 years,

14:07.980 --> 14:10.080
 so definitely time to get back to deep space,

14:10.080 --> 14:11.000
 time to get to the moon.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.720
 There's so much to do on the moon.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.100
 I hope we don't get stuck on the moon for 50 years.

14:16.100 --> 14:19.000
 I really want to get to the moon, spend the next decade,

14:19.000 --> 14:20.720
 first with the lander, then humans.

14:20.720 --> 14:21.960
 There's just a lot to explore,

14:21.960 --> 14:24.440
 but to me it's a big technology push.

14:24.440 --> 14:25.340
 It's only three days away.

14:25.340 --> 14:27.680
 So the moon is definitely the right place.

14:27.680 --> 14:29.600
 So we kind of buy down our technology.

14:29.600 --> 14:33.840
 We invest in specifically habitats, life support systems.

14:33.840 --> 14:34.720
 So we need suits.

14:34.720 --> 14:37.780
 We really need to understand really how to live off planet.

14:37.780 --> 14:39.480
 We've been off planet and low earth orbit,

14:39.480 --> 14:42.780
 but still that's only 400 kilometers up, 250 miles, right?

14:42.780 --> 14:43.840
 So we get to the moon.

14:43.840 --> 14:47.320
 It really is a great proving ground for the technologies.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.840
 And now we're in deep space, radiation becomes a huge issue

14:50.840 --> 14:52.440
 and to keep our astronauts well and alive.

14:52.440 --> 14:57.440
 And I look at all of that investment for moon exploration

14:57.480 --> 15:00.680
 to the ultimate goal, the horizon goals we call it,

15:00.680 --> 15:01.860
 to get people to Mars.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.720
 But we just don't go to Mars tomorrow, right?

15:03.720 --> 15:05.740
 We really need a decade on the moon, I think,

15:05.740 --> 15:07.680
 investing in the technologies, learning,

15:07.680 --> 15:09.960
 making sure the astronauts are, their health,

15:09.960 --> 15:11.600
 they're safe and well,

15:11.600 --> 15:15.920
 and also learning so much about in situ research utilization,

15:15.920 --> 15:19.080
 ISRU, in situ resource utilization is huge

15:19.080 --> 15:21.160
 when it comes to exploration for the moon and Mars.

15:21.160 --> 15:23.160
 So we need a test bed.

15:23.160 --> 15:26.860
 And to me, it really is a lunar test bed.

15:26.860 --> 15:29.300
 And then we use those same investments

15:29.300 --> 15:32.520
 to think about getting people to Mars in the 2030s.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.040
 So developing sort of a platform

15:34.040 --> 15:36.200
 of all the kind of research tools of all the,

15:36.200 --> 15:39.040
 what's the resource utilization, can you speak to that?

15:39.040 --> 15:42.000
 Yeah, so ISRU for the moon, it's,

15:42.000 --> 15:45.200
 we'll go to the South Pole and it's fascinating.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.720
 We have images of it.

15:46.720 --> 15:49.040
 Of course, we know there's permanently shaded areas

15:49.040 --> 15:50.880
 and like by Shackleton crater,

15:50.880 --> 15:53.320
 and there's areas that are permanently in the sun.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.480
 Well, it seems that there's a lot of water ice,

15:56.480 --> 16:00.000
 water that's entrapped in ice and the lunar craters.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.260
 That's the first place you go.

16:01.260 --> 16:02.100
 Why?

16:02.100 --> 16:03.880
 Because it's water and when you wanna try to,

16:03.880 --> 16:06.160
 it could be fuel, life support systems.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.800
 So you kind of, again, you go where the water is.

16:08.800 --> 16:12.680
 And so when the moon is kind of for resources utilization,

16:12.680 --> 16:13.560
 but to learn how to,

16:13.560 --> 16:16.000
 can we make the fuels out of the resources

16:16.000 --> 16:16.900
 that are on the moon?

16:16.900 --> 16:18.240
 We have to think about 3D printing, right?

16:18.240 --> 16:20.120
 You don't get to bring all this mass with you.

16:20.120 --> 16:22.800
 You have to learn how to literally live off the land.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.240
 We need a pressure shell.

16:24.240 --> 16:28.320
 We need to have an atmosphere for people to live in.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.040
 So all of that is kind of buying down the technology,

16:31.040 --> 16:32.960
 doing the investigation, doing the science.

16:32.960 --> 16:35.520
 What are the basically called lunar volatiles?

16:35.520 --> 16:38.140
 What is that ice on the moon?

16:38.140 --> 16:40.200
 How much of it is there?

16:40.200 --> 16:42.120
 What are the resources look like?

16:42.120 --> 16:44.320
 To me, that helps us, that's just the next step

16:44.320 --> 16:46.480
 in getting humans to Mars.

16:46.480 --> 16:47.800
 You know, it's cheaper and more effective

16:47.800 --> 16:50.160
 to sort of develop some of these difficult challenges,

16:50.160 --> 16:51.640
 like solve some of these challenges,

16:51.640 --> 16:53.960
 practice, develop, test, and so on on the moon.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.000
 Absolutely. That is on Mars.

16:55.000 --> 16:55.820
 Absolutely.

16:55.820 --> 16:56.660
 And people are gonna love to, you know,

16:56.660 --> 16:57.500
 you get to the moon, you get to,

16:57.500 --> 16:58.880
 you have a beautiful Earthrise.

16:58.880 --> 17:01.160
 I mean, you have the most magnificent view of Earth

17:01.160 --> 17:02.520
 being off planet.

17:02.520 --> 17:03.500
 So it just makes sense.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.320
 I think we're gonna have thousands, lots of people,

17:05.320 --> 17:06.840
 hopefully tens of thousands in low Earth orbit,

17:06.840 --> 17:08.960
 because low Earth orbit is a beautiful place to go

17:08.960 --> 17:09.780
 and look down on the Earth,

17:09.780 --> 17:11.080
 but people wanna return home.

17:11.080 --> 17:12.720
 I think the lunar explorers

17:12.720 --> 17:15.400
 will also wanna do round trips

17:15.400 --> 17:17.800
 and, you know, be on the moon, three day trip,

17:17.800 --> 17:20.560
 explore, do science, also because the lunar day

17:20.560 --> 17:23.600
 is 14 days and lunar nights, also 14 days.

17:23.600 --> 17:26.080
 So in that 28 day cycle, you know,

17:26.080 --> 17:28.460
 half of it is in light, half of it's in dark.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.840
 So people would probably wanna do, you know,

17:31.840 --> 17:33.760
 couple of week trips, month long trips,

17:33.760 --> 17:34.720
 not longer than that.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.400
 What do you mean by people?

17:36.400 --> 17:37.400
 People, explorers.

17:37.400 --> 17:41.000
 I mean, yeah, astronauts are gonna be civilians

17:41.000 --> 17:41.840
 in the future too.

17:41.840 --> 17:44.320
 Not all astronauts are gonna be government astronauts.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.640
 Actually, when I was at NASA, we changed,

17:45.640 --> 17:48.720
 we actually got the law changed to recognize astronauts

17:48.720 --> 17:50.360
 that are not only government employees,

17:50.360 --> 17:51.360
 you know, NASA astronauts

17:51.360 --> 17:52.840
 or European Space Agency astronauts

17:52.840 --> 17:54.960
 or Russian Space Agency that astronauts,

17:54.960 --> 17:58.320
 because of the big push we put on the private sector,

17:58.320 --> 17:59.920
 that astronauts essentially are gonna be astronauts.

17:59.920 --> 18:02.820
 You get over 100 kilometers up

18:02.820 --> 18:06.520
 and think once you've done orbital flight,

18:06.520 --> 18:07.600
 then you're an astronaut.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.400
 So a lot of private citizens are gonna become astronauts.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.360
 Do you think one day you might step foot on the moon?

18:13.360 --> 18:14.560
 I think it'd be good to go to the moon.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.200
 I'd give that a shot.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.120
 Mars, I'm gonna, it's my life's work

18:18.120 --> 18:20.320
 to get the next generation to Mars.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.960
 That's you or even younger than you,

18:22.960 --> 18:24.920
 you know, my students generation

18:24.920 --> 18:26.680
 will be the Martian explorers.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.920
 I'm just working to facilitate that,

18:28.920 --> 18:30.240
 but that's not gonna be me.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.200
 Hey, the moon's pretty good.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.880
 And it's a lot tough.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.840
 I mean, it's still a really tough mission.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.280
 It's an extreme mission, exactly.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.960
 It's great for exploration, but doable,

18:39.960 --> 18:41.160
 but again, before Apollo,

18:41.160 --> 18:44.000
 we didn't think getting humans to the moon was even possible.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.500
 So we kind of made that possible, but we need to go back.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.960
 We absolutely need to go back.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.400
 We're investing in the heavy lift launch capabilities

18:50.400 --> 18:51.240
 that we need to get there.

18:51.240 --> 18:52.080
 We haven't had that, you know,

18:52.080 --> 18:53.960
 since the Apollo days, since Saturn five.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.480
 So now we have three options on the board.

18:56.480 --> 18:57.480
 That's what's so fantastic.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.760
 NASA has its space launch system.

18:59.760 --> 19:02.720
 SpaceX is gonna have its heavy capability

19:02.720 --> 19:05.320
 and Blue Origin is coming along too with heavy lifts.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.840
 So that's pretty fantastic from where I sit.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.880
 I'm the Apollo program professor.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.040
 Today I have zero heavy lift launch capability.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.680
 I can't wait, just in a few years,

19:13.680 --> 19:16.020
 we'll have three different heavy lift launch capabilities.

19:16.020 --> 19:18.120
 So that's pretty exciting.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.600
 You know, your heart is perhaps with NASA,

19:20.600 --> 19:23.480
 but you mentioned SpaceX and Blue Origin.

19:23.480 --> 19:26.900
 What are your thoughts of SpaceX

19:26.900 --> 19:28.720
 and the innovative efforts there

19:28.720 --> 19:31.360
 from the sort of private company aspect?

19:31.360 --> 19:32.200
 Oh, they're great.

19:32.200 --> 19:35.320
 They're, remember that the investments in SpaceX

19:35.320 --> 19:36.420
 is government funding.

19:36.420 --> 19:39.240
 It's NASA funding, it's US Air Force funding,

19:39.240 --> 19:40.480
 just as it should be,

19:40.480 --> 19:44.160
 because they're betting on a company who is moving fast,

19:44.160 --> 19:46.380
 has some new technology development.

19:46.380 --> 19:47.220
 So I love it.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.060
 So when I was at NASA,

19:48.060 --> 19:50.320
 it really was under our public private partnerships.

19:50.320 --> 19:53.440
 So necessarily the government needs to fund

19:53.440 --> 19:54.520
 these startups.

19:54.520 --> 19:56.240
 Now, SpaceX is no longer a startup,

19:56.240 --> 19:58.240
 but you know, it's been at it for 10 years.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.640
 It's had some accidents, learned a lot of lessons,

20:00.640 --> 20:03.800
 but it's great because it's the way you move faster.

20:03.800 --> 20:06.240
 And also some private industry folks,

20:06.240 --> 20:08.740
 some private businesses will take a lot more risk.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.400
 That's also really important for the government.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.000
 What do you think about that culture of risk?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.360
 I mean, sort of NASA and the government

20:15.360 --> 20:18.160
 are exceptionally good at delivering sort of safe,

20:18.160 --> 20:21.640
 like there's a bit more of a culture of caution and safety

20:21.640 --> 20:23.440
 and sort of this kind of solid engineering.

20:23.440 --> 20:26.080
 And I think SpaceX as well has the same kind of stuff.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.160
 It has a little bit more of that startup feel

20:28.160 --> 20:29.840
 where they take the bigger risks.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.720
 Is that exciting for you to see,

20:31.720 --> 20:33.840
 seeing bigger risks in this kind of space?

20:33.840 --> 20:34.960
 Absolutely.

20:34.960 --> 20:38.520
 And the best scenario is both of them working together

20:38.520 --> 20:40.120
 because there's really important lessons learned,

20:40.120 --> 20:41.880
 especially when you talk about human space flight,

20:41.880 --> 20:43.760
 safety, quality assurance.

20:43.760 --> 20:46.000
 These things are the utmost importance,

20:46.000 --> 20:47.840
 both aviation and space, you know,

20:47.840 --> 20:49.280
 when human lives are at stake.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.760
 On the other hand, government agencies,

20:51.760 --> 20:53.840
 NASA can be European Space Agency, you name it,

20:53.840 --> 20:56.780
 they become very bureaucratic, pretty risk averse,

20:56.780 --> 20:58.100
 move pretty slowly.

20:58.100 --> 21:01.380
 So I think the best is when you combine the partnerships

21:01.380 --> 21:02.220
 from both sides.

21:03.360 --> 21:05.360
 Industry necessarily has to push the government,

21:05.360 --> 21:06.200
 take some more risks.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.160
 You know, they're smart risk

21:07.160 --> 21:09.960
 or actually gave an award at NASA for failing smart.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.560
 Failing smart, I love that.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.920
 You know, so you can kind of break open the culture,

21:13.920 --> 21:16.340
 say, no, look at Apollo, that was a huge risk.

21:16.340 --> 21:17.600
 It was done well.

21:17.600 --> 21:20.520
 So there's always a culture of safety, quality assurance,

21:20.520 --> 21:23.320
 you know, engineering, you know, at its best.

21:23.320 --> 21:26.100
 But on the other hand, you want to get things done

21:26.100 --> 21:27.520
 and you have to also get them,

21:27.520 --> 21:28.980
 you have to bring the cost down.

21:28.980 --> 21:29.940
 You know, for when it comes to launch,

21:29.940 --> 21:31.040
 we really have to bring the cost down

21:31.040 --> 21:32.320
 and get the frequency up.

21:32.320 --> 21:34.120
 And so that's what the newcomers are doing.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.520
 They're really pushing that.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.840
 So it's about the most exciting time

21:37.840 --> 21:39.680
 that I can imagine for space flight.

21:39.680 --> 21:41.800
 Again, a little bit, it really is the democratization

21:41.800 --> 21:43.320
 of space flight, opening it up,

21:43.320 --> 21:45.200
 not just because of the launch capability,

21:45.200 --> 21:47.560
 but the science we can do on a CubeSat.

21:47.560 --> 21:49.560
 What you can do now for very,

21:49.560 --> 21:51.920
 those used to be, you know, student projects

21:51.920 --> 21:54.080
 that we would go through, conceive, design, implement,

21:54.080 --> 21:56.360
 and think about what a small satellite would be.

21:56.360 --> 21:58.080
 Now they're the most, you know,

21:58.080 --> 21:59.800
 these are really advanced instruments,

21:59.800 --> 22:02.520
 science instruments that are flying on little teeny CubeSats

22:02.520 --> 22:04.600
 that pretty much anyone can afford.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.960
 So there's not a, there's every nation,

22:06.960 --> 22:10.320
 you know, every place in the world can fly a CubeSat.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.160
 And so that's...

22:11.160 --> 22:12.000
 What's a CubeSat?

22:12.000 --> 22:15.160
 Oh, CubeSat is a, this is called 1U.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.000
 CubeSats we measure in terms of units.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.360
 So, you know, just in terms of, I put my,

22:19.360 --> 22:21.560
 both my hands together, that's one unit, two units.

22:21.560 --> 22:22.720
 So little small satellites.

22:22.720 --> 22:25.480
 So CubeSats are for small satellites.

22:25.480 --> 22:26.940
 And we actually go by mass as well.

22:26.940 --> 22:29.340
 You know, a small satellite might be a hundred kilos,

22:29.340 --> 22:32.400
 200 kilos, all well under a thousand kilos.

22:32.400 --> 22:35.020
 CubeSats then are the next thing down from small sats.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.320
 You know, basically, you know,

22:37.320 --> 22:39.480
 kilos, tens of kilos, things like that.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.200
 But kind of the building blocks,

22:41.200 --> 22:42.560
 CubeSats are fantastic design,

22:42.560 --> 22:44.080
 it's kind of modular design.

22:44.080 --> 22:47.760
 So I can take a 1U, one unit of CubeSat and, you know,

22:47.760 --> 22:50.300
 but what if I have a little bit more money and payload,

22:50.300 --> 22:51.520
 I can fly three of them

22:51.520 --> 22:54.080
 and just basically put a lot more instruments on it.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.560
 But essentially think about something

22:55.560 --> 22:57.740
 the size of a shoe box, if you will.

22:57.740 --> 22:59.560
 You know, that would be a CubeSat.

22:59.560 --> 23:02.840
 And how do those help empower you in terms of doing size,

23:02.840 --> 23:04.000
 in terms of doing experiments?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.680
 Oh, right now there's, again,

23:05.680 --> 23:07.600
 back to private industry, Planet, the company,

23:07.600 --> 23:08.880
 is, you know, flying CubeSats

23:08.880 --> 23:10.880
 and literally looking down on Earth

23:10.880 --> 23:13.600
 and orbiting Earth, taking a picture, if you will,

23:13.600 --> 23:15.560
 of Earth every day, every 24 hours,

23:15.560 --> 23:16.560
 covering the entire Earth.

23:16.560 --> 23:19.160
 So in terms of Earth observations,

23:19.160 --> 23:20.240
 in terms of climate change,

23:20.240 --> 23:22.140
 in terms of our changing Earth,

23:22.140 --> 23:24.940
 it's revolutionizing because they're affordable.

23:24.940 --> 23:26.480
 We can put a whole bunch of them up.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.600
 Telecoms, we're all, you know, on our cell phones

23:28.600 --> 23:30.760
 and we have GPS, we have our telecoms,

23:30.760 --> 23:33.820
 but those used to be very expensive satellites

23:33.820 --> 23:34.960
 providing that service.

23:34.960 --> 23:38.580
 Now we can fly a whole bunch of modular CubeSats.

23:38.580 --> 23:42.460
 So it really is breakthrough in terms of modularity,

23:42.460 --> 23:44.280
 as well as cost reduction.

23:44.280 --> 23:47.380
 So that's one exciting set of developments.

23:47.380 --> 23:51.080
 Is there something else that you've been excited about,

23:51.080 --> 23:52.600
 like reusable rockets, perhaps,

23:52.600 --> 23:54.100
 that you've seen in the last few years?

23:54.100 --> 23:55.440
 Yeah, well, the reusability you had,

23:55.440 --> 23:57.520
 and the reusability is awesome.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.200
 I mean, it's just the best.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.600
 Now we have to remember, the shuttle was a reusable vehicle.

24:01.600 --> 24:02.440
 Yes.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.440
 Which, and the shuttle is an amazing,

24:04.440 --> 24:05.520
 it's narrow space engineer.

24:05.520 --> 24:06.460
 You know, I mean, the shuttle is still,

24:06.460 --> 24:09.160
 this is the most gorgeous, elegant,

24:09.160 --> 24:12.400
 extraordinary design of a space vehicle.

24:12.400 --> 24:15.320
 It was reusable, it just wasn't affordable.

24:15.320 --> 24:18.080
 But the reusability of it was really critical

24:18.080 --> 24:19.660
 because we flew it up, it did come back.

24:19.660 --> 24:23.640
 So the notion of reusability, I think absolutely.

24:23.640 --> 24:26.480
 Now what we're doing with we, you know,

24:26.480 --> 24:29.160
 the Global We, but with SpaceX and Lord Jim,

24:29.160 --> 24:31.440
 setting the rockets up, recovering the first stages,

24:31.440 --> 24:35.360
 where if they can regain 70% cost savings, that's huge.

24:35.360 --> 24:37.800
 And just seeing the control,

24:37.800 --> 24:39.940
 you know, being in control and dynamic as a person,

24:39.940 --> 24:41.680
 just seeing that rocket come back and land.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.600
 Oh yeah, that's.

24:42.600 --> 24:45.040
 It never gets old, it's exciting every single time

24:45.040 --> 24:46.720
 you look at it and say, that's magic.

24:46.720 --> 24:48.080
 So it's so cool.

24:48.080 --> 24:49.480
 To me, the landing is where I stand up,

24:49.480 --> 24:51.320
 start clapping, just the control.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.820
 Yeah, just the algorithm, just the control algorithms,

24:53.820 --> 24:55.620
 and hitting that landing, it's, you know,

24:55.620 --> 24:58.320
 it's gymnastics for rocket ships,

24:58.320 --> 25:01.080
 but to see these guys stick a landing,

25:01.080 --> 25:01.920
 it's just wonderful.

25:01.920 --> 25:04.320
 So every time, like I say, every time I see,

25:05.200 --> 25:07.440
 you know, the reusability and the rockets coming back

25:07.440 --> 25:09.800
 and landing so precisely, it's really exciting.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.320
 So it is actually, that's a game changer.

25:12.320 --> 25:15.120
 We are in a new era of lower costs

25:15.120 --> 25:17.520
 and the higher frequency.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.600
 And it's the world, not just NASA,

25:19.600 --> 25:23.840
 many nations are really upping their frequency of launches.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.720
 So you've done a lot of exciting research,

25:25.720 --> 25:28.960
 design, engineering on spacesuits.

25:28.960 --> 25:33.120
 What does the spacesuit of the future look like?

25:33.120 --> 25:34.520
 Well, if I have anything to say about it,

25:34.520 --> 25:37.280
 it'll be a very, it'll be a very tight fitting suit.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.880
 We use mechanical counter pressure

25:38.880 --> 25:41.080
 to pressurize right directly on the skin.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.880
 Seems that it's technically feasible.

25:42.880 --> 25:44.400
 We're still at the research and development stage.

25:44.400 --> 25:47.000
 We don't have a flight system, but technically it's feasible.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.720
 So we do a lot of work in the materials.

25:48.720 --> 25:51.400
 You know, what materials do we need to pressurize someone?

25:51.400 --> 25:52.720
 What's the patterning we need?

25:52.720 --> 25:54.760
 That's what our patents are in, the patterning,

25:54.760 --> 25:55.640
 kind of how we apply.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.440
 This is a third of an atmosphere.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.220
 Just to sort of take a little step back,

25:59.220 --> 26:02.240
 you have this incredible biosuit where it's tight fitting,

26:02.240 --> 26:04.400
 so it allows more mobility and so on.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.240
 So maybe even to take a bigger step back,

26:06.240 --> 26:09.480
 like what are the functions that a spacesuit should perform?

26:09.480 --> 26:11.600
 Sure, so start from the beginning.

26:11.600 --> 26:14.280
 A spacesuit is the world's smallest spacecraft.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.460
 So I really, that's the best definition I can give you.

26:16.460 --> 26:18.220
 Right now we fly gas pressurized suits,

26:18.220 --> 26:22.220
 but think of developing and designing an entire spacecraft.

26:22.220 --> 26:23.760
 So then you take all those systems

26:23.760 --> 26:25.580
 and you shrink them around a person,

26:25.580 --> 26:27.040
 provide them with oxygen to breathe,

26:27.040 --> 26:29.080
 scrub out their carbon dioxide,

26:29.080 --> 26:30.100
 you know, make sure they have pressure.

26:30.100 --> 26:31.680
 They need a pressure environment to live in.

26:31.680 --> 26:34.980
 So really the spacesuit is a shrunken,

26:34.980 --> 26:37.000
 you know, spacecraft in its entirety,

26:37.000 --> 26:37.840
 has all the same systems.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.080
 Communication as well, probably.

26:39.080 --> 26:41.400
 Yeah, communications, exactly.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.040
 So you really, thermal control,

26:44.040 --> 26:45.920
 little bit of radiation, not so much radiation protection,

26:45.920 --> 26:47.960
 but thermal control, humidity, you know, oxygen debris.

26:47.960 --> 26:49.700
 So all those life support systems,

26:49.700 --> 26:51.600
 as well as the pressure protection.

26:51.600 --> 26:53.480
 So it's an engineering marvel, you know,

26:53.480 --> 26:54.520
 the spacesuits that have flown

26:54.520 --> 26:56.400
 because they really are entire spacecraft,

26:56.400 --> 26:59.040
 they're the small spacecraft that we have around a person,

26:59.040 --> 27:00.720
 but they're very massive,

27:00.720 --> 27:02.960
 but 140 kilos is the current suit,

27:02.960 --> 27:04.360
 and they're not mobility suits.

27:04.360 --> 27:06.020
 So since we're going back to the moon and Mars,

27:06.020 --> 27:08.480
 we need a planetary suit, we need a mobility suit.

27:08.480 --> 27:11.640
 So that's where we've kind of flipped the design paradigm.

27:11.640 --> 27:14.600
 I study astronauts, I study humans in motion,

27:14.600 --> 27:16.240
 and if we can map that motion,

27:16.240 --> 27:17.600
 I want to give you full flexibility,

27:17.600 --> 27:19.120
 you know, move your arms and legs.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.640
 I really want you to be like a Olympic athlete,

27:21.640 --> 27:23.460
 an extreme explorer.

27:23.460 --> 27:25.220
 I don't want to waste any of your energy,

27:25.220 --> 27:27.100
 so we take it from the human design.

27:27.100 --> 27:30.000
 So I take a look at humans, we measure them, we model them,

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
 and then I say, okay, can I put a spacesuit on them

27:33.000 --> 27:34.160
 that goes from the skin out?

27:34.160 --> 27:36.420
 So rather than a gas pressurized shrinking

27:36.420 --> 27:38.760
 that spacecraft around the person,

27:38.760 --> 27:40.400
 say, here's how humans perform,

27:40.400 --> 27:42.960
 can I design a spacesuit literally from the skin out?

27:42.960 --> 27:44.480
 And that's what we've come up with,

27:44.480 --> 27:46.400
 a mechanical counter pressure, some patterning,

27:46.400 --> 27:49.320
 and that way it could be order of magnitude less

27:49.320 --> 27:51.020
 in terms of the mass,

27:51.020 --> 27:54.560
 and it should provide maximum mobility for moon or Mars.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.120
 What's mechanical counter pressure?

27:56.120 --> 27:58.920
 Like how the heck can you even begin

27:58.920 --> 28:01.480
 to create something that's tight fitting

28:02.480 --> 28:05.040
 and still doesn't protect you from the elements and so on

28:05.040 --> 28:06.880
 and the whole, the pressure thing?

28:06.880 --> 28:08.640
 That's the challenge, it's a big design challenge

28:08.640 --> 28:09.780
 we've been working on it for.

28:09.780 --> 28:11.360
 So you can either put someone in a balloon,

28:11.360 --> 28:12.840
 that's one way to do it, that's conventional,

28:12.840 --> 28:13.680
 that's the only thing we've ever formed.

28:13.680 --> 28:14.520
 What's that mean?

28:14.520 --> 28:15.340
 That means the balloon that you fill with gas?

28:15.340 --> 28:16.180
 That's a gas pressurized suit.

28:16.180 --> 28:17.020
 If you put someone in a balloon,

28:17.020 --> 28:18.960
 it's only a third of an atmosphere

28:18.960 --> 28:19.800
 to keep someone alive.

28:19.800 --> 28:20.760
 So that's what the current system is.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.360
 So depending on what units you think,

28:22.360 --> 28:25.240
 in 30 kilopascals, 4.3 pounds per square inch.

28:25.240 --> 28:28.160
 So much less than the pressure that's on Earth.

28:28.160 --> 28:31.720
 You can still keep a human alive with 0.3

28:31.720 --> 28:33.520
 and it's alive and happy.

28:33.520 --> 28:34.360
 Alive and happy.

28:34.360 --> 28:35.760
 And you mix the gases.

28:35.760 --> 28:37.720
 June, we're having this chat

28:37.720 --> 28:41.520
 and we're at one sea level in Boston, one atmosphere.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.400
 But a suit. Oxygen and nitrogen.

28:43.400 --> 28:44.240
 Oxygen and nitrogen.

28:44.240 --> 28:46.720
 And you put a suit, if we put someone to a third

28:46.720 --> 28:49.480
 of an atmosphere, so for mechanical counter pressure now,

28:49.480 --> 28:51.400
 so one way is to do it with a balloon.

28:51.400 --> 28:52.840
 And that's what we currently have.

28:52.840 --> 28:55.080
 Or you can apply the pressure directly to the skin.

28:55.080 --> 28:58.640
 I only have to give you a third of an atmosphere.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.520
 Right now, you and I are very happy in one atmosphere.

29:00.520 --> 29:04.480
 So if I put that pressure, a third of an atmosphere on you,

29:04.480 --> 29:06.520
 I just have to do it consistently,

29:06.520 --> 29:08.560
 across all of your body and your limbs.

29:08.560 --> 29:10.760
 And it'll be a gas pressurized helmet.

29:10.760 --> 29:13.200
 Doesn't make sense to shrink wrap the head.

29:13.200 --> 29:15.800
 See the blue mangrove, that's a great, it's a great act.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.640
 But we don't need to, there's no benefits

29:17.640 --> 29:19.040
 of like shrink wrapping the head.

29:19.040 --> 29:21.120
 You put, you know, a gas pressurized helmet

29:21.120 --> 29:23.360
 because the helmet then, the future of suits,

29:23.360 --> 29:25.040
 you asked me about, the helmet just becomes

29:25.040 --> 29:26.660
 your information portal.

29:26.660 --> 29:28.440
 So it will have augmented reality.

29:28.440 --> 29:30.380
 It'll have all the information you need.

29:30.380 --> 29:32.080
 Should have, you know, the maps that I need.

29:32.080 --> 29:33.000
 I'm on the moon.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.760
 Okay, well, hey, smart helmet.

29:34.760 --> 29:36.920
 Then show me the map, show me the topography.

29:36.920 --> 29:38.600
 Hopefully it has the lab embedded too.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.200
 If it has really great cameras,

29:40.200 --> 29:41.600
 maybe I can see with that regolith.

29:41.600 --> 29:43.080
 That's just lunar dust and dirt.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.160
 What's that made out of?

29:44.160 --> 29:45.480
 We talked about the water.

29:45.480 --> 29:48.520
 So the helmet then really becomes this information portal

29:48.520 --> 29:51.780
 is how I see kind of the IT architecture of the helmet

29:51.780 --> 29:54.700
 is really allowing me to, you know,

29:54.700 --> 29:58.520
 use all of my modalities of an explorer that I'd like to.

29:58.520 --> 30:01.820
 So cameras, voiceover, images, if it were really good,

30:01.820 --> 30:05.240
 it would kind of be, would have lab capabilities as well.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.200
 Okay, so the pressure comes from the body,

30:07.200 --> 30:09.240
 comes from the mechanical pressure.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.480
 It's fascinating.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.880
 Now, what aspect, when I look at Biosuit,

30:12.880 --> 30:14.480
 just the suits you're working on,

30:14.480 --> 30:17.660
 sort of from a fashion perspective, they look awesome.

30:17.660 --> 30:20.720
 Is that a small part of it too?

30:20.720 --> 30:23.440
 Oh, absolutely, because the teams that we work with,

30:23.440 --> 30:25.480
 of course, I'm an engineer, there's engineering students,

30:25.480 --> 30:27.260
 there's design students, there's architects.

30:27.260 --> 30:29.800
 So it really is a very much a multidisciplinary team.

30:29.800 --> 30:33.440
 So sure, colors, aesthetics, materials,

30:33.440 --> 30:34.920
 all those things we pay attention to.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.920
 So it's not just an engineering solution.

30:36.920 --> 30:39.920
 It really is a much more holistic, it's a suit.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.360
 It's a suit, you're, you know,

30:41.360 --> 30:42.200
 you're dressed in a suit now.

30:42.200 --> 30:43.720
 It's a warm fitting.

30:43.720 --> 30:46.280
 So we really have to pay attention to all those things.

30:46.280 --> 30:49.480
 And so that's the design team that we work with.

30:49.480 --> 30:50.760
 And my partner, Geetraati, you know,

30:50.760 --> 30:52.680
 we're partners in this in terms of,

30:52.680 --> 30:56.080
 he comes from an architecture, industrial design background.

30:56.080 --> 30:58.120
 So bringing those skills to bear as well.

30:58.120 --> 31:01.120
 We team up with industry folks who are in, you know,

31:01.120 --> 31:03.000
 athletic performance and designers.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.480
 So it really is a team

31:04.480 --> 31:06.280
 that brings all those skills together.

31:06.280 --> 31:08.960
 So what role does this space suit play

31:08.960 --> 31:11.320
 in our longterm staying in Mars,

31:11.320 --> 31:13.240
 sort of exploring the,

31:13.240 --> 31:14.640
 doing all the work that astronauts do,

31:14.640 --> 31:17.440
 but also perhaps civilians one day,

31:17.440 --> 31:20.120
 almost like taking steps towards colonization of Mars?

31:20.120 --> 31:21.760
 What role does a space suit play there?

31:21.760 --> 31:25.440
 So you always need life support system, pressurized habitat.

31:25.440 --> 31:28.440
 And I like to say, we're not going to Mars to sit around.

31:28.440 --> 31:29.960
 So you need a suit.

31:29.960 --> 31:32.160
 You know, even if you land and have the lander,

31:32.160 --> 31:33.720
 you're not going there to stay inside.

31:33.720 --> 31:34.560
 That's for darn sure.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.200
 We're going there to search for the evidence of life.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.400
 That's why we're going to Mars.

31:37.400 --> 31:39.080
 So you need a lot of mobility.

31:39.080 --> 31:41.400
 So for me, the suit is the best way

31:41.400 --> 31:42.920
 to give the human mobility.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.560
 We're always still going to need rovers.

31:44.560 --> 31:45.720
 We're going to need robots.

31:45.720 --> 31:49.440
 So for me, exploration is always a suite of explorers.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.280
 Some people are going to,

31:50.280 --> 31:51.840
 some of the suite of explorers are humans,

31:51.840 --> 31:55.040
 but many are going to be robots, smart systems,

31:55.040 --> 31:55.880
 things like that.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.480
 But I look at it as kind of all those capabilities together

31:58.480 --> 32:00.160
 make the best exploration team.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.800
 So let me ask, I love artificial intelligence

32:03.800 --> 32:07.640
 and I've also saw that you've enjoyed the movie

32:07.640 --> 32:10.120
 Space Odyssey, 2001 Space Odyssey.

32:10.120 --> 32:12.520
 Let me ask the question about HAL 9000.

32:12.520 --> 32:14.080
 That makes a few decisions there

32:14.080 --> 32:17.440
 that prioritizes the mission over the astronauts.

32:17.440 --> 32:20.360
 Do you think, from a high philosophical question,

32:20.360 --> 32:22.760
 do you think HAL did the right thing

32:22.760 --> 32:24.720
 of prioritizing the mission?

32:24.720 --> 32:26.840
 I think our artificial intelligence

32:26.840 --> 32:28.760
 will be smarter in the future.

32:28.760 --> 32:30.240
 For a Mars mission, it's a great question

32:30.240 --> 32:32.680
 that the reality is for a Mars mission,

32:32.680 --> 32:34.400
 we need fully autonomous systems.

32:34.400 --> 32:37.720
 We will get humans, but they have to be fully autonomous.

32:37.720 --> 32:38.760
 And that's a really important,

32:38.760 --> 32:41.040
 that's the most important concept

32:41.040 --> 32:45.040
 because there's not going to be a mission control on Earth.

32:45.040 --> 32:47.680
 20 minute time lag,

32:47.680 --> 32:48.920
 there's just no way you're going to control it.

32:48.920 --> 32:49.960
 So fully autonomous,

32:49.960 --> 32:51.720
 so people have to be fully autonomous as well,

32:51.720 --> 32:53.280
 but all of our systems as well.

32:53.280 --> 32:55.440
 And so that's the big design challenge.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.360
 So that's why we test them out on the moon as well.

32:57.360 --> 32:59.000
 When we have a, okay, a few second,

32:59.000 --> 33:00.840
 three second time lag, you can test them out.

33:00.840 --> 33:05.360
 We have to really get autonomous exploration down.

33:05.360 --> 33:06.920
 You asked me earlier about Magellan.

33:06.920 --> 33:09.120
 Magellan and his crew, they left, right?

33:09.120 --> 33:11.200
 They were autonomous.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.200
 You know, they were autonomous.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.000
 They left and they were on their own

33:14.000 --> 33:15.080
 to figure out that mission.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.920
 Then when they hit land, they have resources,

33:16.920 --> 33:19.000
 that's in situ resource utilization

33:19.000 --> 33:21.040
 and everything else they brought with them.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.280
 So we have to, I think, have that mindset for exploration.

33:23.280 --> 33:25.280
 Again, back to the moon, it's more the testing ground,

33:25.280 --> 33:27.240
 the proving ground with technologies.

33:27.240 --> 33:29.600
 But when we get to Mars, it's so far away

33:29.600 --> 33:31.600
 that we need fully autonomous systems.

33:31.600 --> 33:35.360
 So I think that's where, again, AI and autonomy come in,

33:35.360 --> 33:36.680
 a really robust autonomy,

33:36.680 --> 33:38.480
 things that we don't have today yet.

33:38.480 --> 33:39.880
 So they're on the drawing boards,

33:39.880 --> 33:41.320
 but we really need to test them out

33:41.320 --> 33:43.280
 because that's what we're up against.

33:43.280 --> 33:45.760
 So fully autonomous meaning like self sufficient.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.320
 There's still a role for the human in that picture.

33:48.320 --> 33:52.440
 Do you think there'll be a time when AI systems,

33:52.440 --> 33:55.360
 beyond doing fully autonomous flight control

33:55.360 --> 33:58.840
 will also help or even take mission decisions

33:58.840 --> 33:59.800
 like Hal did?

33:59.800 --> 34:00.640
 That's interesting.

34:00.640 --> 34:01.480
 It depends.

34:01.480 --> 34:02.680
 I mean, they're gonna be designed by humans.

34:02.680 --> 34:04.560
 I think as you mentioned, humans are always in the loop.

34:04.560 --> 34:05.560
 I mean, we might be on Earth,

34:05.560 --> 34:06.880
 we might be in orbit on Mars,

34:06.880 --> 34:10.040
 maybe the systems of landers down on the surface of Mars.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.320
 But I think we're gonna get,

34:12.320 --> 34:14.920
 we are right now just on Earth based systems,

34:14.920 --> 34:18.520
 AI systems that are incredibly capable

34:18.520 --> 34:22.680
 and training them with all the data that we have now,

34:22.680 --> 34:24.720
 petabytes of data from Earth.

34:24.720 --> 34:27.240
 What I care about for the autonomy and AI right now,

34:27.240 --> 34:29.000
 how we're applying it in research

34:29.000 --> 34:31.120
 is to look at Earth and look at climate systems.

34:31.120 --> 34:33.440
 I mean, that's the, it's not for Mars to me today.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.480
 Right now AI is to eyes on Earth,

34:35.480 --> 34:39.600
 all of our space data, compiling that using supercomputers

34:39.600 --> 34:41.880
 because we have so much information and knowledge

34:41.880 --> 34:43.600
 and we need to get that into people's hands.

34:43.600 --> 34:46.080
 First, there's the educational issue with climate

34:46.080 --> 34:47.480
 and our changing climate.

34:47.480 --> 34:49.840
 Then we need to change human behavior.

34:49.840 --> 34:50.680
 That's the biggie.

34:50.680 --> 34:52.960
 So this next decade, it's urgent

34:52.960 --> 34:55.600
 we take care of our own spaceship, which is spaceship Earth.

34:55.600 --> 35:00.320
 So that's to me where my focus has been for AI systems,

35:00.320 --> 35:02.120
 using whatever's out there,

35:02.120 --> 35:05.360
 kind of imagining also what the future situation is,

35:05.360 --> 35:07.760
 what's the satellite imagery of Earth of the future.

35:07.760 --> 35:09.480
 If you can hold that in your hands,

35:09.480 --> 35:10.680
 that's gonna be really powerful.

35:10.680 --> 35:14.160
 Will that help people accelerate positive change for Earth

35:14.160 --> 35:15.600
 and for us to live in balance with Earth?

35:15.600 --> 35:16.440
 I hope so.

35:16.440 --> 35:17.920
 And kind of start with the ocean systems.

35:17.920 --> 35:20.440
 So oceans to land to air and kind of using

35:20.440 --> 35:21.320
 all the space data.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.080
 So it's a huge role for artificial intelligence

35:24.080 --> 35:27.160
 to help us analyze, I call it curating the data,

35:27.160 --> 35:28.400
 using the data.

35:28.400 --> 35:31.000
 It has a lot to do with visualizations as well.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.200
 Do you think in a weird, dark question,

35:34.200 --> 35:36.880
 do you think human species can survive

35:36.880 --> 35:39.160
 if we don't become interplanetary

35:39.160 --> 35:43.440
 in the next century or a couple of centuries?

35:44.400 --> 35:45.880
 Absolutely we can survive.

35:45.880 --> 35:48.400
 I don't think Mars is option B actually.

35:48.400 --> 35:51.160
 So I think it's all about saving spaceship Earth

35:51.160 --> 35:52.280
 and humanity.

35:52.280 --> 35:55.200
 I simply put, Earth doesn't need us,

35:55.200 --> 35:57.000
 but we really need Earth.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
 All of humanity needs to live in balance with Earth

36:00.000 --> 36:01.240
 because Earth has been here a long time

36:01.240 --> 36:02.120
 before we ever showed up

36:02.120 --> 36:03.920
 and it'll be here a long time after.

36:03.920 --> 36:06.040
 It's just a matter of how do we wanna live

36:06.040 --> 36:09.240
 with all living beings, much more in balance

36:09.240 --> 36:11.240
 because we need to take care of the Earth

36:11.240 --> 36:12.760
 and right now we're not.

36:12.760 --> 36:14.000
 So that's the urgency.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.760
 And I think it is the next decade

36:15.760 --> 36:18.640
 to try to live much more sustainably,

36:18.640 --> 36:19.960
 live more in balance with Earth.

36:19.960 --> 36:23.280
 I think the human species has a great long optimistic future,

36:23.280 --> 36:24.760
 but we have to act.

36:24.760 --> 36:25.600
 It's urgent.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.280
 We have to change behavior.

36:27.280 --> 36:30.280
 We have to realize that we're all in this together.

36:30.280 --> 36:31.840
 It's just one blue bubble.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.200
 It's for humanity.

36:33.200 --> 36:35.960
 So when I think people realize that we're all astronauts,

36:35.960 --> 36:38.600
 that's the great news is everyone's gonna be an astronaut.

36:38.600 --> 36:41.200
 We're all astronauts of spaceship Earth.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.520
 And again, this is our mission.

36:42.520 --> 36:45.120
 This is our mission to take care of the planet.

36:45.120 --> 36:50.120
 And yet as we explore out from our spaceship Earth here

36:50.160 --> 36:52.320
 out into the space,

36:52.320 --> 36:55.240
 what do you think the next 50, 100, 200 years

36:55.240 --> 36:56.920
 look like for space exploration?

36:56.920 --> 36:58.680
 I'm optimistic.

36:58.680 --> 37:01.880
 So I think that we'll have lots of people,

37:01.880 --> 37:03.480
 thousands of people, tens of thousands of people,

37:03.480 --> 37:05.200
 who knows, maybe millions in low Earth orbit.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.960
 That's just a place that we're gonna have people

37:06.960 --> 37:11.280
 and actually some industry, manufacturing, things like that.

37:11.280 --> 37:13.560
 That dream I hope we realize, getting people to the moon.

37:13.560 --> 37:15.920
 So I can envision a lot of people on the moon.

37:15.920 --> 37:17.160
 Again, it's a great place to go.

37:17.160 --> 37:18.960
 Living or visiting?

37:18.960 --> 37:21.160
 Probably visiting and living.

37:21.160 --> 37:22.960
 If you want to, most people are gonna wanna come back

37:22.960 --> 37:23.880
 to Earth, I think.

37:23.880 --> 37:26.200
 But there'll be some people and it's not such a long,

37:26.200 --> 37:28.040
 it's a good view, it's a beautiful view.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.720
 So I think that we will have many people

37:30.720 --> 37:31.560
 on the moon as well.

37:31.560 --> 37:33.880
 I think there'll be some people, you told me, wow,

37:33.880 --> 37:34.880
 hundreds of years out.

37:34.880 --> 37:37.360
 So we'll have people, we'll be interplanetary for sure

37:37.360 --> 37:38.640
 as a species.

37:38.640 --> 37:39.840
 So I think we'll be on the moon.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.640
 I think we'll be on Mars.

37:41.640 --> 37:43.760
 Venus, no, it's already a runaway greenhouse gas.

37:43.760 --> 37:46.120
 So not a great place for science.

37:46.120 --> 37:47.880
 Jupiter, all within the solar system,

37:47.880 --> 37:50.080
 great place for all of our scientific probes.

37:50.080 --> 37:53.280
 I don't see so much in terms of human physical presence.

37:53.280 --> 37:54.200
 We'll be exploring them.

37:54.200 --> 37:57.560
 So we live in our minds there because we're exploring them

37:57.560 --> 37:59.240
 and going on those journeys.

37:59.240 --> 38:03.960
 But it's really our choice in terms of our decisions

38:03.960 --> 38:07.280
 of how in balance we're gonna be living here on the Earth.

38:07.280 --> 38:11.760
 When do you think the first woman, first person will step on Mars?

38:11.760 --> 38:12.600
 Ah, step on Mars?

38:12.600 --> 38:14.520
 Well, I'm gonna do everything I can

38:14.520 --> 38:16.360
 to make sure it happens in the 2030s.

38:16.360 --> 38:17.200
 2030s.

38:17.200 --> 38:22.200
 Say mid, 20, mid 20, 2025, 2035, we'll be on the moon.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.280
 And hopefully with more people than us.

38:24.280 --> 38:25.760
 But first with a few astronauts,

38:25.760 --> 38:27.640
 it'll be global, international folks.

38:27.640 --> 38:29.920
 But we really need those 10 years, I think, on the moon.

38:29.920 --> 38:33.520
 And then so by later in the decade, in the 2030s,

38:33.520 --> 38:35.400
 we'll have all the technology and know how,

38:35.400 --> 38:38.400
 and we need to get that human mission to Mars done.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.760
 We live in exciting times.

38:39.760 --> 38:41.800
 And, Dava, thank you so much for leading the way
