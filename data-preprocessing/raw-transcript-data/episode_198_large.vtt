00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
 The following is a conversation with Sarah Walker,

00:02.400 --> 00:05.000
 an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist

00:05.000 --> 00:08.600
 at Arizona State University and the Santa Fe Institute.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.960
 She's interested in the origin of life,

00:10.960 --> 00:13.520
 how to find life on other worlds,

00:13.520 --> 00:15.880
 and in general, the more fundamental question

00:15.880 --> 00:18.160
 of what even life is.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.260
 She seeks to discover the universal laws

00:20.260 --> 00:23.400
 that describe living systems on Earth and elsewhere

00:23.400 --> 00:26.440
 using physics, biology, and computation.

00:26.440 --> 00:30.360
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Athletic Greens,

00:30.360 --> 00:33.380
 NetSuite, Blinkist, and Magic Spoon.

00:33.380 --> 00:36.280
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:36.280 --> 00:39.400
 As a side note, let me say that my hope for this podcast

00:39.400 --> 00:42.120
 is to try and alternate between technical

00:42.120 --> 00:44.040
 and nontechnical discussions,

00:44.040 --> 00:45.720
 to jump from the big picture

00:45.720 --> 00:48.040
 down to specific detailed research

00:48.040 --> 00:49.800
 and back to the big picture,

00:49.800 --> 00:53.720
 and to do so with scientists and non scientists.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.360
 Long term, I hope to alternate between discussions

00:56.360 --> 00:59.920
 of cutting edge research in AI, physics, biology,

00:59.920 --> 01:03.280
 to topics of music, sport, and history,

01:03.280 --> 01:05.360
 and then back to AI.

01:05.360 --> 01:06.700
 AI is home.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.280
 I hope you come along with me

01:08.280 --> 01:11.520
 for that wild, oscillating journey.

01:11.520 --> 01:14.360
 Some people message me saying to slow down

01:14.360 --> 01:15.440
 since they're falling behind

01:15.440 --> 01:17.780
 on the episodes of this podcast.

01:17.780 --> 01:19.980
 To their disappointment, I have to say

01:19.980 --> 01:22.560
 that I'll probably do more episodes, not less,

01:22.560 --> 01:25.600
 but you really don't need to listen to every episode.

01:25.600 --> 01:28.540
 Just listen to the ones that spark your curiosity.

01:28.540 --> 01:30.720
 Think about it like a party full of strangers.

01:30.720 --> 01:32.760
 You don't have to talk to everyone.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.840
 Just walk over to the ones who look interesting

01:34.840 --> 01:36.320
 and get to know them.

01:36.320 --> 01:39.400
 And if you're lucky, that one conversation with a stranger

01:39.400 --> 01:41.680
 might change the direction of your life.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.280
 And it's a short life, so be picky with the strangers

01:44.280 --> 01:47.560
 you talk to at this metaphorical party.

01:47.560 --> 01:49.560
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast,

01:49.560 --> 01:52.560
 and here is my conversation with Sarah Walker.

01:52.560 --> 01:55.640
 How did life originate on Earth?

01:55.640 --> 01:57.480
 What are the various hypotheses

01:57.480 --> 02:00.000
 for how life originated on Earth?

02:00.000 --> 02:03.140
 Yeah, so I guess you're asking a historical question,

02:03.140 --> 02:06.880
 which is always a good place to start thinking about life.

02:06.880 --> 02:10.640
 So there's a lot of ideas about how life started on Earth.

02:10.640 --> 02:11.840
 Probably the most popular

02:11.840 --> 02:15.520
 is what's called the RNA world scenario.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.920
 So this idea is probably the one

02:17.920 --> 02:20.020
 that you'll see most reported in the news.

02:20.020 --> 02:25.020
 And is based on the idea that there are molecules

02:27.260 --> 02:31.620
 in our bodies that relay genetic information.

02:31.620 --> 02:33.420
 And we know those as DNA, obviously,

02:33.420 --> 02:37.080
 but there's also a sort of an intermediary called RNA,

02:37.080 --> 02:41.220
 ribonucleic acid, that also plays the role of proteins.

02:41.220 --> 02:44.740
 And people came up with this idea in the 80s

02:44.740 --> 02:47.180
 that maybe that was the first genetic material

02:47.180 --> 02:50.180
 because it could play both roles of being genetic

02:50.180 --> 02:52.380
 and performing catalysis.

02:52.380 --> 02:55.520
 And then somehow that idea got reduced to this idea

02:55.520 --> 02:59.300
 that there was a molecule that emerged on early Earth

02:59.300 --> 03:01.640
 and underwent Darwinian evolution,

03:01.640 --> 03:03.340
 and that was the start of life.

03:03.340 --> 03:06.380
 So there's a lot of assumptions packed in there

03:06.380 --> 03:08.340
 that we could unpack,

03:08.340 --> 03:10.240
 but that's sort of the leading hypothesis.

03:10.240 --> 03:13.260
 There's also other ideas about life starting as metabolism.

03:13.260 --> 03:14.660
 And so that's more connected

03:14.660 --> 03:17.380
 to the geochemistry of early Earth.

03:17.380 --> 03:19.560
 And it would be kind of more focused on this idea

03:19.560 --> 03:22.720
 that you get some kind of catalytic cycle of molecules

03:22.720 --> 03:24.060
 that can reproduce themselves

03:24.060 --> 03:25.860
 and form some kind of metabolism.

03:25.860 --> 03:28.340
 And then life starts basically a self organization.

03:28.340 --> 03:31.280
 And then you have to explain how evolution comes later.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.700
 Right, so that's the difference

03:32.700 --> 03:35.700
 between sort of energy and genetic code.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.460
 So like energy and information

03:37.460 --> 03:39.620
 are those are the two kind of things there?

03:39.620 --> 03:41.140
 Yeah, I think that's a good way of putting it.

03:41.140 --> 03:43.420
 It's kind of funny,

03:43.420 --> 03:44.820
 because I think most of the people that think about

03:44.820 --> 03:46.780
 these things are really disciplinary bias.

03:46.780 --> 03:48.500
 So the people that tend to think about genetics

03:48.500 --> 03:49.780
 come from a biology background

03:49.780 --> 03:51.620
 and they're really evolution focused.

03:51.620 --> 03:52.940
 And so they're worried about

03:52.940 --> 03:54.580
 where does the information come from?

03:54.580 --> 03:55.800
 And how does it change over time?

03:55.800 --> 03:57.880
 But they're talking about information in a really narrow way

03:57.880 --> 04:00.420
 where they're talking about a genetic sequence.

04:00.420 --> 04:03.980
 And then most of the people that think about metabolism,

04:03.980 --> 04:06.140
 origins of life scenarios tend to be

04:06.140 --> 04:07.940
 people like physicists or geochemists

04:07.940 --> 04:09.580
 that are worried about what are the energy sources

04:09.580 --> 04:11.900
 and what kinds of organization

04:11.900 --> 04:14.100
 can you get out of those energy sources?

04:14.100 --> 04:15.880
 Okay, so which one is your favorite?

04:15.880 --> 04:17.460
 I don't like either.

04:17.460 --> 04:19.220
 Okay, all right, can we talk about them

04:19.220 --> 04:20.060
 for a little bit longer though?

04:20.060 --> 04:21.420
 Yeah, no, that's fine.

04:23.700 --> 04:26.020
 So okay, so there's early Earth.

04:26.020 --> 04:27.000
 What was that like?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.220
 Was there just mostly covered by oceans?

04:29.220 --> 04:31.700
 Was there heat sources, energy sources?

04:31.700 --> 04:35.260
 So if we talk about the metabolism view

04:35.260 --> 04:36.500
 of the origin of life,

04:36.500 --> 04:38.380
 like where was the source of energy?

04:38.380 --> 04:39.700
 Probably the most popular view

04:39.700 --> 04:42.220
 for where the origin of life happened on Earth

04:42.220 --> 04:45.500
 is hydrothermal vents because they had sufficient energy.

04:45.500 --> 04:50.180
 And so we don't really know a lot about early Earth.

04:50.180 --> 04:53.420
 We have some ideas about when oceans first formed

04:53.420 --> 04:54.260
 and things like that,

04:54.260 --> 04:55.440
 but the time of the origin of life

04:55.440 --> 04:59.100
 is kind of not well understood or pinned down

04:59.100 --> 05:02.240
 and the conditions on Earth at that time are not well known.

05:02.240 --> 05:03.580
 But a lot of people do think

05:03.580 --> 05:05.600
 that there was probably hydrothermal vents

05:05.600 --> 05:10.020
 which are really hot, chemically active regions,

05:10.020 --> 05:12.660
 say on the seafloor in modern times,

05:12.660 --> 05:14.740
 which also would have been present on early Earth.

05:14.740 --> 05:17.960
 And they would have provided energy and organics

05:17.960 --> 05:20.180
 and basically all of the right conditions

05:20.180 --> 05:22.420
 for the origins of life,

05:22.420 --> 05:23.260
 which is one of the reasons

05:23.260 --> 05:24.820
 that we look for these hydrothermal systems

05:24.820 --> 05:27.300
 when we're talking about life elsewhere too.

05:27.300 --> 05:30.020
 Okay, and for the genetic code,

05:30.020 --> 05:32.180
 the idea is that the RNA is the first,

05:32.180 --> 05:37.180
 like why would RNA be the first moment you can say it's life?

05:37.620 --> 05:39.500
 I guess the idea is it could both

05:40.500 --> 05:42.080
 have persistent information

05:42.940 --> 05:45.140
 and then it can also do some of the work

05:45.140 --> 05:49.100
 of like what, creating a self sustaining organism?

05:49.100 --> 05:50.940
 Yeah, that's the basic idea.

05:50.940 --> 05:54.580
 So the idea is you have, in an RNA molecule,

05:54.580 --> 05:56.340
 you have a sequence of characters, say,

05:56.340 --> 05:58.820
 so you can treat it like a string in a computer

05:58.820 --> 06:00.060
 and it can be copied.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.780
 So information can be propagated,

06:02.780 --> 06:06.000
 which is important for evolution

06:06.000 --> 06:07.380
 because evolution happens

06:07.380 --> 06:09.580
 by having inheritance of information.

06:09.580 --> 06:11.620
 So for example, like my eyes are brown

06:11.620 --> 06:13.900
 because my mother's eyes were brown.

06:13.900 --> 06:16.180
 So you need that copying of information,

06:16.180 --> 06:21.180
 but then you also have the ability to perform catalysis,

06:22.020 --> 06:24.400
 which means that that RNA molecule

06:24.400 --> 06:26.040
 is not inert in that environment,

06:26.040 --> 06:27.980
 but it actually interacts with something

06:27.980 --> 06:31.260
 and could potentially mediate, say, a metabolism

06:31.260 --> 06:33.980
 that could then fuel the actual reproduction

06:33.980 --> 06:35.380
 of that molecule.

06:35.380 --> 06:40.100
 So in some ways, people think that RNA gives you

06:42.140 --> 06:44.480
 the most bang for your buck in a single molecule

06:44.480 --> 06:47.180
 and therefore, it gives you all the features

06:47.180 --> 06:48.900
 that you might think are life.

06:49.820 --> 06:52.300
 And so this is sort of where this RNA world conjecture

06:52.300 --> 06:54.540
 came from is because of those two properties.

06:54.540 --> 06:59.100
 Isn't it amazing that RNA came to be in general?

06:59.100 --> 07:01.100
 Isn't it? Yes, that is amazing.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.660
 Okay, so we're not talking down about RNA.

07:03.660 --> 07:04.820
 No, no, I love RNA.

07:04.820 --> 07:06.180
 It's one of my favorite molecules.

07:06.180 --> 07:08.700
 I think it's beautiful. It's just not step one.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.800
 Yeah, I think the issue,

07:10.800 --> 07:12.980
 it's not even the RNA world is a problem

07:12.980 --> 07:16.820
 and actually, if you really dig into it,

07:16.820 --> 07:19.340
 the RNA world is not one hypothesis.

07:19.340 --> 07:22.260
 It is a set of hypothesis, hypotheses, sorry.

07:22.260 --> 07:27.260
 And they range from a molecule of RNA spontaneously emerged

07:27.380 --> 07:29.740
 on the early Earth and started evolving,

07:29.740 --> 07:31.820
 which is kind of like the hardest RNA world scenario,

07:31.820 --> 07:36.620
 which is the one I cited and I get a little animated about

07:36.620 --> 07:39.320
 because it seems so blatantly wrong to me,

07:39.320 --> 07:40.700
 but that's a separate story.

07:40.700 --> 07:43.140
 And then the other one is actually something I agree with,

07:43.140 --> 07:46.500
 which is that you can say there was an RNA world

07:46.500 --> 07:49.180
 because RNA was the first genetic material

07:49.180 --> 07:50.340
 for life on Earth.

07:50.340 --> 07:54.700
 So an RNA world could just be the earliest organisms

07:54.700 --> 07:57.500
 that had genetics in a modern sense,

07:57.500 --> 08:01.100
 didn't have DNA evolved yet, they had RNA, right?

08:01.100 --> 08:03.780
 And so that's sort of a softer RNA world scenario

08:03.780 --> 08:06.020
 in the sense that it doesn't mean it was the first thing

08:06.020 --> 08:10.420
 that happened, but it was a thing that definitely was part

08:10.420 --> 08:12.780
 of the lineage of events that led to us.

08:12.780 --> 08:16.280
 So if a life was like a best of album,

08:16.280 --> 08:18.820
 it would be on the, it'd be one of the songs on there.

08:18.820 --> 08:19.860
 Yes. One of the early songs.

08:19.860 --> 08:20.700
 Okay.

08:20.700 --> 08:21.660
 It's on the greatest hits.

08:21.660 --> 08:23.740
 Greatest hits, that's the word I was looking for.

08:23.740 --> 08:24.580
 Okay.

08:24.580 --> 08:28.820
 Did life, do you think, originate once, twice,

08:28.820 --> 08:30.740
 three times on Earth, multiple times?

08:30.740 --> 08:31.780
 What do you think?

08:31.780 --> 08:33.860
 I think that's a really difficult question.

08:33.860 --> 08:35.460
 Is it an important question?

08:35.460 --> 08:36.700
 It's a super important question.

08:36.700 --> 08:39.500
 No, it's a really important question.

08:39.500 --> 08:44.500
 And so there's a lot of questions in that question.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.580
 So one of the first ones that I think needs to be addressed

08:48.580 --> 08:50.940
 is is the origin of life a continuous process

08:50.940 --> 08:52.020
 on our planet?

08:52.020 --> 08:54.380
 So we think about the origin of life as something

08:54.380 --> 08:58.180
 that happened on Earth, say almost 4 billion years ago,

08:58.180 --> 09:00.620
 because we have evidence of life emerging very early

09:00.620 --> 09:01.480
 on our planet.

09:02.700 --> 09:06.100
 And then an origin of life event, quote unquote,

09:06.100 --> 09:08.620
 a singular event, whatever that was, happened.

09:08.620 --> 09:12.740
 And then all life on Earth that we know is a descendant

09:12.740 --> 09:14.780
 of that particular event in our universe, right?

09:14.780 --> 09:19.780
 And so, but we don't have any idea one way or the other

09:21.940 --> 09:25.020
 if the origin of life is happening repeatedly,

09:25.020 --> 09:26.300
 and maybe it's just not taking off

09:26.300 --> 09:27.660
 because life is already established.

09:27.660 --> 09:29.540
 That's a argument that people will make,

09:29.540 --> 09:33.140
 or maybe there are alternative forms of life on Earth

09:33.140 --> 09:35.340
 that we don't even recognize.

09:35.340 --> 09:36.860
 So this is the idea of a shadow biosphere

09:36.860 --> 09:38.060
 that there actually might just be

09:38.060 --> 09:39.500
 completely other life on Earth,

09:39.500 --> 09:42.940
 but it's so alien that we don't even know what it is.

09:42.940 --> 09:45.380
 I'm gonna have to talk to you about the shadow biosphere.

09:45.380 --> 09:46.420
 Yeah, that's a fun one.

09:46.420 --> 09:49.740
 In a second, but first, let me ask for the other alternative,

09:49.740 --> 09:51.400
 which is panspermia.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.240
 Right.

09:52.240 --> 09:55.300
 So that's the idea, the hypothesis that life exists

09:55.300 --> 09:57.300
 elsewhere in the universe and got to us

09:57.300 --> 09:59.860
 through like an asteroid or a planetoid

09:59.860 --> 10:02.660
 or some, according to Wikipedia, space dust,

10:02.660 --> 10:03.960
 whatever the heck that is.

10:05.380 --> 10:06.220
 It sounds fun.

10:06.220 --> 10:10.240
 But basically, it rode along whatever kind of rock

10:10.240 --> 10:11.820
 and got to us.

10:11.820 --> 10:15.020
 Do you think that's at all a possibility?

10:15.020 --> 10:15.860
 Sure.

10:15.860 --> 10:19.100
 So I think the reason that most original life scientists

10:19.100 --> 10:20.820
 are interested in the original life on Earth

10:20.820 --> 10:25.040
 and say not the original life on Mars

10:25.040 --> 10:26.980
 and then panspermia,

10:26.980 --> 10:29.380
 the exchange of life between planets being the explanation

10:29.380 --> 10:32.020
 is once you start removing the original life from Earth,

10:32.020 --> 10:33.780
 you know even less about it

10:33.780 --> 10:36.060
 than you do if you study it on Earth.

10:36.060 --> 10:37.740
 Although, I think there are ways

10:37.740 --> 10:38.780
 of reformulating the problem.

10:38.780 --> 10:40.460
 This is why I said earlier,

10:40.460 --> 10:42.460
 oh, you mean the historical original life problem.

10:42.460 --> 10:44.980
 You don't mean the problem of how does life arise

10:44.980 --> 10:47.340
 in the universe and what the universal principles are

10:47.340 --> 10:48.780
 because there's this historic problem,

10:48.780 --> 10:50.420
 how did it happen on early Earth?

10:50.420 --> 10:53.140
 And there's a more tractable general problem

10:53.140 --> 10:54.300
 of how does it happen?

10:55.180 --> 10:57.260
 And how does it happen is something we can actually ask

10:57.260 --> 10:58.100
 in the lab.

10:58.100 --> 11:00.740
 How did it happen on early Earth

11:00.740 --> 11:04.220
 is a much more detailed and nuanced question

11:04.220 --> 11:06.500
 and requires detailed knowledge of what was happening

11:06.500 --> 11:08.980
 on early Earth that we don't have.

11:08.980 --> 11:11.380
 And I'm personally more interested in general mechanisms.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.180
 So to me, it doesn't matter if it happened on Earth

11:13.180 --> 11:15.140
 or it happened on Mars.

11:15.140 --> 11:16.700
 It just matters that it happened.

11:16.700 --> 11:18.520
 We have evidence it happened.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.220
 The question is, did it happen more than once

11:20.220 --> 11:21.340
 in our universe?

11:21.340 --> 11:24.260
 And so the reason I don't find panspermia

11:24.260 --> 11:25.940
 as a particularly,

11:25.940 --> 11:28.740
 I think it's a fascinating hypothesis.

11:28.740 --> 11:30.980
 I definitely think it's possible.

11:30.980 --> 11:33.820
 And I in particular think it's possible

11:33.820 --> 11:36.140
 once you get to the stage of life where you have technology

11:36.140 --> 11:38.580
 because then you obviously can spread out

11:38.580 --> 11:40.220
 into the cosmos.

11:40.220 --> 11:41.940
 But it's also possible for microbes

11:41.940 --> 11:45.420
 because we know that certain microorganisms

11:45.420 --> 11:47.020
 can survive the journey in space.

11:47.020 --> 11:50.940
 And they can live in a rock and go between Mars and Earth.

11:50.940 --> 11:51.940
 Like people have done experiments

11:51.940 --> 11:54.140
 to try to prove that could work.

11:54.140 --> 11:57.100
 So in that scenario, it's super cool

11:57.100 --> 11:58.340
 because then you get planetary exchange,

11:58.340 --> 12:00.560
 but say we go look for life on Mars

12:00.560 --> 12:02.780
 and it ends up being exactly the same life we have on Earth,

12:02.780 --> 12:04.340
 biochemically speaking,

12:04.340 --> 12:05.740
 then we haven't really discovered something new

12:05.740 --> 12:06.980
 about the universe.

12:06.980 --> 12:08.620
 What kind of aliens are possible

12:08.620 --> 12:10.780
 were there other origin of life events?

12:10.780 --> 12:12.980
 If we find, if all the life we ever find

12:12.980 --> 12:14.740
 is the same origin of life event in the universe,

12:14.740 --> 12:16.580
 it doesn't help me solve my problem.

12:16.580 --> 12:19.380
 But it's possible that that would be a sign

12:19.380 --> 12:22.260
 that you could separate the environment

12:22.260 --> 12:24.780
 from the basic ingredients.

12:24.780 --> 12:25.620
 Yes, that's true.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.860
 So you can have like a life gun

12:27.860 --> 12:30.100
 that you shoot throughout the universe.

12:30.100 --> 12:32.900
 And then like once you shoot it,

12:32.900 --> 12:34.900
 it's like the Simpsons with a makeup gun.

12:34.900 --> 12:36.280
 That was a great episode.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.060
 When you shoot this life gun,

12:39.060 --> 12:42.380
 it'll find the Earth's, it'll like get sticky.

12:42.380 --> 12:44.180
 It'll stick to the Earth's.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.860
 And that kind of reduces the barrier

12:46.860 --> 12:49.580
 of like the time it takes,

12:49.580 --> 12:52.220
 the luck it takes to actually,

12:52.220 --> 12:54.660
 from nothing, from the basic chemistry,

12:54.660 --> 12:56.300
 from the basic physics of the universe

12:56.300 --> 12:58.540
 for the life to spring up.

12:58.540 --> 13:00.780
 Yeah, I think this is actually super important

13:00.780 --> 13:01.700
 to just think about,

13:01.700 --> 13:05.540
 like does life getting seated on a planet

13:05.540 --> 13:08.820
 have to be geochemically compatible with that planet?

13:08.820 --> 13:11.340
 So you're suggesting like we could just shoot guns in space

13:11.340 --> 13:13.140
 and like life could go to Mars

13:13.140 --> 13:16.500
 and then it would just live there and be happy there.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.400
 But that's actually an open question.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.040
 So one of the things I was gonna say in response

13:20.040 --> 13:22.620
 to your question about whether the origin of life

13:22.620 --> 13:24.420
 happened once or multiple times,

13:24.420 --> 13:26.400
 is for me personally right now in my thinking,

13:26.400 --> 13:28.400
 although this changes on a weekly basis,

13:28.400 --> 13:31.740
 but is that I think of life more as a planetary phenomenon.

13:31.740 --> 13:32.740
 So I think the origin of life

13:32.740 --> 13:37.380
 because life is so intimately tied to planetary cycles

13:37.380 --> 13:38.780
 and planetary processes,

13:38.780 --> 13:39.980
 and this goes all the way back

13:39.980 --> 13:41.540
 through the history of our planet,

13:41.540 --> 13:44.220
 that the origin of life itself grew out of geochemistry

13:44.220 --> 13:46.300
 and became coupled and controlled geochemistry.

13:46.300 --> 13:49.160
 And when we start to talk about life existing on the planet

13:49.160 --> 13:51.220
 is when we have evidence of life

13:51.220 --> 13:54.120
 actually influencing properties of the planet.

13:55.060 --> 13:59.220
 And so if life is a planetary property,

13:59.220 --> 14:01.660
 then going to Mars is not a trivial thing

14:01.660 --> 14:05.520
 because you basically have to make Mars more Earth like.

14:05.520 --> 14:07.620
 And so in some sense,

14:07.620 --> 14:09.460
 like when I think about sort of longterm vision

14:09.460 --> 14:11.700
 of humans in space, for example,

14:11.700 --> 14:14.020
 really what you're talking about when you're saying,

14:14.020 --> 14:16.620
 let's send our civilization to Mars

14:16.620 --> 14:18.660
 is you're not saying let's send our civilization to Mars,

14:18.660 --> 14:21.900
 you're saying let's reproduce our planet on Mars.

14:21.900 --> 14:23.220
 Like the information from our planet

14:23.220 --> 14:26.180
 actually has to go to Mars and make Mars more Earth like,

14:26.180 --> 14:28.560
 which means that you're now having a reproduction process,

14:28.560 --> 14:29.940
 like a cell reproduces itself

14:29.940 --> 14:32.540
 to propagate information in the future.

14:32.540 --> 14:35.280
 Planets have to figure out how to reproduce their conditions,

14:35.280 --> 14:37.980
 including geochemical conditions on other planets

14:37.980 --> 14:40.360
 in order to actually reproduce life in the universe,

14:40.360 --> 14:41.700
 which is kind of a little bit radical,

14:41.700 --> 14:44.380
 but I think for longterm sustainability

14:44.380 --> 14:47.300
 of life on a planet, that's absolutely essential.

14:47.300 --> 14:50.680
 Okay, so if we were to think about life

14:50.680 --> 14:52.780
 as a planetary phenomena,

14:52.780 --> 14:55.100
 and so life on Mars would be best

14:55.100 --> 14:57.580
 if it's way different than life on Earth,

14:57.580 --> 14:59.620
 we have to ask the very basic question

14:59.620 --> 15:03.380
 of what is life?

15:03.380 --> 15:06.180
 I actually don't think that's the right question to ask.

15:06.180 --> 15:07.740
 It took me a long time to get there, right?

15:07.740 --> 15:08.820
 So I... Cross it out.

15:08.820 --> 15:11.660
 Yeah, cross it off your list, it's wrong.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.020
 Next question.

15:13.020 --> 15:15.220
 No, no, no, I mean, I think it has an answer,

15:15.220 --> 15:17.820
 but I think the part of the problem is,

15:17.820 --> 15:19.260
 you know, most of the places in science

15:19.260 --> 15:20.100
 where we get really stuck

15:20.100 --> 15:22.260
 is because we don't know what questions to ask.

15:22.260 --> 15:24.020
 And so you can't answer a question

15:24.020 --> 15:25.860
 if you're asking the wrong question.

15:25.860 --> 15:29.380
 And I think the way I think about it

15:29.380 --> 15:31.180
 is obviously I'm interested in what life is.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.460
 So I'm being a little cheeky when I say

15:32.460 --> 15:33.580
 that's the wrong question to ask.

15:33.580 --> 15:35.420
 That's exactly like the question

15:35.420 --> 15:36.980
 that's like the core of my existence.

15:36.980 --> 15:40.780
 But I think the way of framing that

15:40.780 --> 15:43.140
 is what is it about our universe

15:43.140 --> 15:47.440
 that allows features that we associate life to be there?

15:47.440 --> 15:50.300
 And so really what I guess when I'm asking that question,

15:50.300 --> 15:52.620
 what I'm after is an explanatory framework

15:52.620 --> 15:54.340
 for what life is, right?

15:54.340 --> 15:57.380
 And so most people, they try to go in and define life

15:57.380 --> 15:59.660
 and they say, well, life is say,

15:59.660 --> 16:01.680
 a self reproducing chemical system

16:01.680 --> 16:02.980
 capable of Darwinian evolution.

16:02.980 --> 16:05.440
 That's a very popular definition for life.

16:05.440 --> 16:08.340
 Or life is something that metabolizes and eats.

16:08.340 --> 16:10.060
 That is not how I think about life.

16:10.060 --> 16:13.260
 What I think about life is there are principles

16:13.260 --> 16:15.640
 and laws that govern our universe

16:15.640 --> 16:17.980
 that we don't understand yet,

16:17.980 --> 16:22.340
 that have something to do with how information interacts

16:22.340 --> 16:23.660
 with the physical world.

16:23.660 --> 16:26.300
 I don't know exactly what I mean even when I say that,

16:26.300 --> 16:28.460
 because we don't know these rules,

16:28.460 --> 16:32.180
 but it's a little bit like, I like to use analogies.

16:32.180 --> 16:34.480
 You give me time to be like a little long winded

16:34.480 --> 16:36.700
 for a second, even in as I,

16:36.700 --> 16:39.520
 but sort of like if you look at the history of physics,

16:39.520 --> 16:40.740
 for example, this is like,

16:40.740 --> 16:45.220
 so we are in the period of the development of thought

16:45.220 --> 16:47.980
 on our planet where we don't understand what we are yet.

16:47.980 --> 16:49.100
 Right?

16:49.100 --> 16:51.660
 There was a period of thought in the history of our planet

16:51.660 --> 16:53.820
 where we didn't understand what gravity was.

16:53.820 --> 16:55.740
 And we didn't understand, for example,

16:55.740 --> 16:59.340
 that planets in the heavens were actually planets

16:59.340 --> 17:02.060
 or that they operated by the same laws that we did.

17:02.060 --> 17:05.140
 And so there has been this sort of progression

17:05.140 --> 17:07.460
 of getting a deeper understanding

17:07.460 --> 17:09.060
 of explaining basic phenomena.

17:09.060 --> 17:10.420
 Like, I'm not gonna drop the cup.

17:10.420 --> 17:11.260
 I'll drop the water bottle.

17:11.260 --> 17:12.100
 There you go.

17:12.100 --> 17:13.140
 Okay, that fell, right?

17:13.140 --> 17:14.260
 But why did that fall?

17:16.300 --> 17:19.180
 This is why I'm a theorist, not an experimentalist.

17:19.180 --> 17:20.900
 That could have gone wrong in so many ways.

17:20.900 --> 17:21.740
 I know, it could have,

17:21.740 --> 17:23.700
 especially if I did the cup and it smashed.

17:23.700 --> 17:28.700
 So if you take this view

17:28.700 --> 17:30.460
 that there's sort of some missing principles,

17:30.460 --> 17:33.700
 I associate them to information.

17:33.700 --> 17:36.400
 And what the sort of feeling there is,

17:36.400 --> 17:39.060
 there's some missing explanatory framework

17:39.060 --> 17:40.440
 for how our universe works.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.400
 And if we understood that physics,

17:42.400 --> 17:44.580
 it would explain what we are.

17:44.580 --> 17:46.240
 It might also explain a lot of other features

17:46.240 --> 17:48.620
 we don't associate to life.

17:48.620 --> 17:51.780
 And so it's a little like people accept the fact

17:51.780 --> 17:54.340
 that gravity is a universal phenomena.

17:54.340 --> 17:55.560
 But when we wanna study gravity,

17:55.560 --> 17:57.460
 we study things like large scale,

17:58.420 --> 18:02.740
 galactic structures or black holes or planets.

18:02.740 --> 18:04.380
 If we wanna understand information

18:04.380 --> 18:05.860
 and how it operates in the physical world,

18:05.860 --> 18:08.380
 we study intelligent systems or living systems

18:08.380 --> 18:10.980
 because they are the manifestation of that physics.

18:10.980 --> 18:13.900
 And the fact that we can't see that clearly yet,

18:13.900 --> 18:15.700
 or we don't have that explanatory framework,

18:15.700 --> 18:17.420
 I think it's just because we haven't been thinking

18:17.420 --> 18:18.700
 about the problem deeply enough.

18:18.700 --> 18:21.500
 But I feel like if you're explaining something,

18:21.500 --> 18:24.140
 you're deriving it from some more fundamental property.

18:24.140 --> 18:28.780
 And of course, I have to say I'm wearing my physicist hat.

18:28.780 --> 18:31.740
 So I have a huge bias of liking simple,

18:31.740 --> 18:33.860
 elegant explanations of the universe

18:33.860 --> 18:37.340
 that really are compelling.

18:37.340 --> 18:39.940
 But I think one of the things that I've sort of

18:39.940 --> 18:42.540
 maybe in some ways rejected my training as a physicist

18:42.540 --> 18:44.580
 is that most of the elegant explanations

18:44.580 --> 18:47.220
 that we have so far don't include us in the universe.

18:47.220 --> 18:48.660
 And I can't help but think

18:48.660 --> 18:50.340
 there's something really special about what we are.

18:50.340 --> 18:52.940
 And there have to be some deep principles at play there.

18:54.620 --> 18:57.420
 And so that's sort of my perspective on it.

18:57.420 --> 18:59.460
 Now, when you ask me what life is,

18:59.460 --> 19:02.060
 I have some ideas of what I think it is,

19:02.060 --> 19:04.820
 but I think that we haven't gotten there yet

19:04.820 --> 19:07.420
 because we haven't been able to see that structure.

19:07.420 --> 19:09.340
 And just to go back to the gravity example,

19:09.340 --> 19:12.380
 it's a little like in ancient times, they didn't know,

19:12.380 --> 19:14.540
 I was talking about stars and heavens and things.

19:14.540 --> 19:17.580
 They didn't know those were governed by the same principles

19:17.580 --> 19:19.300
 as that darned experiment.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.900
 Here's where I was going with it.

19:20.900 --> 19:22.860
 Once you realize, like Newton did,

19:22.860 --> 19:25.780
 that heavenly motions and earthly motions

19:25.780 --> 19:27.060
 are governed by the same principles

19:27.060 --> 19:29.060
 and you unify terrestrial and celestial motion,

19:29.060 --> 19:31.220
 you get these more powerful ideas.

19:31.220 --> 19:35.180
 And I think where life is is somehow unifying

19:35.180 --> 19:38.500
 these abstract ideas of computation and information

19:38.500 --> 19:40.700
 with the physical world, with matter,

19:40.700 --> 19:43.700
 and realizing that there's some explanatory framework

19:43.700 --> 19:46.900
 that's not physics and it's not computation,

19:46.900 --> 19:49.580
 but it's something that's deeper.

19:49.580 --> 19:52.100
 So answering the question of what is life

19:52.100 --> 19:55.900
 requires deeply understanding something about the universe

19:55.900 --> 19:58.900
 as information processing, the universe is computation.

19:58.900 --> 19:59.740
 Sort of.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.900
 It's something about, like would,

20:01.900 --> 20:04.860
 once you come up with an answer to what is life,

20:04.860 --> 20:07.180
 will the words information and computation

20:07.180 --> 20:08.660
 be in the paragraph that answer?

20:08.660 --> 20:09.500
 No, I don't think so.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.460
 Oh, damn it, okay.

20:10.460 --> 20:11.800
 I know, it doesn't help, does it?

20:11.800 --> 20:14.000
 I know, I hate, actually I hate this about what I do

20:14.000 --> 20:16.380
 because it's so hard to communicate, right, with words.

20:16.380 --> 20:20.500
 Like when you have words that are ideas

20:20.500 --> 20:22.700
 that have historically described one thing

20:22.700 --> 20:24.200
 and you're trying to describe something

20:24.200 --> 20:27.900
 people haven't seen yet, and the words just don't fit.

20:27.900 --> 20:31.560
 So what's wrong, is it too ambiguous, the word information?

20:31.560 --> 20:33.380
 We could switch to binary if you want.

20:33.380 --> 20:35.220
 Yeah, no, I don't think it's binary either.

20:35.220 --> 20:36.980
 I think information's just loaded.

20:36.980 --> 20:39.260
 I use it, so the other way I might talk about it

20:39.260 --> 20:41.980
 is the physics of causation, but I think that's worse

20:41.980 --> 20:43.940
 because causation is even more loaded word

20:43.940 --> 20:46.740
 than information.

20:46.740 --> 20:48.780
 So causation is fundamental, you think?

20:48.780 --> 20:52.220
 I do, yeah, and in some sense, I think the physics,

20:52.220 --> 20:53.780
 so this is the really radical part,

20:53.780 --> 20:55.500
 some sense, like when I really think about it

20:55.500 --> 20:58.460
 sort of most deeply, what I think life is

20:58.460 --> 21:00.140
 is actually the physics of existence,

21:00.140 --> 21:01.900
 what gets to exist and why.

21:02.780 --> 21:04.760
 And for simple elementary particles,

21:04.760 --> 21:05.780
 that's not very complicated

21:05.780 --> 21:06.940
 because the interactions are simple,

21:06.940 --> 21:11.060
 but for things like you and me and human civilizations,

21:11.060 --> 21:13.500
 what comes next in the universe

21:13.500 --> 21:15.660
 is really dependent on what came before,

21:15.660 --> 21:17.340
 and there's a huge space of possibilities

21:17.340 --> 21:18.500
 of things that can exist.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.540
 And when I say information and causation,

21:20.540 --> 21:24.900
 what I mean is why is it that cups evolved in the universe

21:24.900 --> 21:27.540
 and not some other object that could deliver water

21:27.540 --> 21:28.600
 and not spill it?

21:29.740 --> 21:31.580
 I don't know what you would call it.

21:31.580 --> 21:34.020
 Maybe it wouldn't be a cup, but it's a huge,

21:37.060 --> 21:38.980
 people talk about the space of things that could exist

21:38.980 --> 21:40.860
 as being actually infinitely large, right?

21:40.860 --> 21:43.420
 I don't know if I believe in infinity,

21:43.420 --> 21:47.380
 but I do think that there is something very interesting

21:47.380 --> 21:51.980
 about the problem of what exists

21:51.980 --> 21:53.300
 in its relationship to life.

21:53.300 --> 21:55.700
 So do you think the set of things

21:55.700 --> 21:58.020
 that could exist is finite?

21:58.020 --> 22:00.700
 It's very large, but if we were to think

22:00.700 --> 22:02.680
 about the physics of existence,

22:04.260 --> 22:07.020
 how many shapes of mugs can there be?

22:08.420 --> 22:10.060
 In the initial programming.

22:10.060 --> 22:13.020
 I should go to the math department for that.

22:13.020 --> 22:14.700
 So that's not a topology question.

22:14.700 --> 22:17.780
 I just mean, maybe another way to ask is

22:17.780 --> 22:20.340
 what do you think is fundamental to the universe

22:20.340 --> 22:21.660
 and what is emergent?

22:21.660 --> 22:24.800
 So if existence, are we supposed to think of that

22:24.800 --> 22:26.900
 as somehow fundamental, you think?

22:26.900 --> 22:28.660
 So there's a couple of problems in physics

22:28.660 --> 22:29.820
 that I think this is related to.

22:29.820 --> 22:31.380
 One is why does mathematics work

22:31.380 --> 22:33.300
 at describing reality so well?

22:33.300 --> 22:36.500
 And then there is this problem of we don't understand

22:36.500 --> 22:38.800
 why the laws of physics are the way they are,

22:38.800 --> 22:40.660
 or why certain things get to exist,

22:40.660 --> 22:44.060
 or what put in place the initial condition of our universe.

22:44.060 --> 22:47.440
 There's all of these sort of really deep and big problems,

22:47.440 --> 22:51.900
 and they all indirectly are related, I think,

22:51.900 --> 22:54.060
 to the same kind of thing that,

22:55.420 --> 22:56.860
 our physics is really good

22:56.860 --> 22:58.620
 if you specify the initial condition

22:58.620 --> 23:01.000
 at specifying a certain sequence of events,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.180
 but it doesn't deal with the fact

23:03.180 --> 23:04.980
 that other things could have happened,

23:04.980 --> 23:06.640
 which is kind of an informational property,

23:06.640 --> 23:08.820
 like a counterfactual property.

23:08.820 --> 23:12.220
 And it's not good at explaining

23:13.780 --> 23:15.860
 this conversation right now.

23:15.860 --> 23:17.660
 There are certain things that are outside

23:17.660 --> 23:19.620
 the explanatory reach of current physics,

23:19.620 --> 23:22.900
 and I think they require looking at it

23:22.900 --> 23:25.060
 from a completely different direction.

23:25.060 --> 23:26.980
 And so I don't wanna have to fine tune

23:26.980 --> 23:28.860
 the initial condition of the universe

23:28.860 --> 23:30.740
 to specify precisely all the information

23:30.740 --> 23:31.580
 in this conversation.

23:31.580 --> 23:33.620
 I think that's a ridiculous assertion.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.620
 But that's sort of like how people wanna frame it

23:35.620 --> 23:40.580
 when they talk about the standard model is sufficient

23:40.580 --> 23:42.060
 if we had computing power

23:42.060 --> 23:44.660
 to basically explain all of life in our existence.

23:44.660 --> 23:45.780
 An interesting thing you said

23:45.780 --> 23:48.640
 is the way we think about information computation

23:48.640 --> 23:53.380
 is by observing a particular kind of systems on Earth

23:53.380 --> 23:56.860
 that exhibit something we think of as intelligence.

23:56.860 --> 24:01.060
 But that's like looking at, I guess, the tip of an iceberg,

24:01.060 --> 24:03.060
 and we should be really looking at the fundamentals

24:03.060 --> 24:08.060
 of the iceberg, like what makes water and ice

24:08.900 --> 24:13.100
 and the chemistry from which intelligence emerges,

24:13.100 --> 24:14.680
 essentially. Yes, yes.

24:14.680 --> 24:17.140
 We can't just couple the information from the physics,

24:17.140 --> 24:19.300
 and I think that's what we've gotten really good at doing,

24:19.300 --> 24:23.540
 especially with sort of the modern age

24:23.540 --> 24:28.540
 where software is so abstracted from hardware.

24:29.580 --> 24:31.780
 But the entire process of biological evolution

24:31.780 --> 24:33.300
 has basically been built,

24:33.300 --> 24:36.700
 like been building layers of increasing abstraction.

24:36.700 --> 24:39.300
 And so it's really hard to see that physics in us,

24:39.300 --> 24:42.540
 but it's much clearer to see it in molecules.

24:42.540 --> 24:44.820
 Yeah, but I guess I'm trying to figure out

24:44.820 --> 24:47.700
 what do you think are the best tools to look at it?

24:48.580 --> 24:50.340
 What do you think?

24:50.340 --> 24:51.660
 An open mind?

24:51.660 --> 24:52.500
 Is that a tool?

24:53.460 --> 24:55.300
 What's the physics of an open mind?

24:56.620 --> 24:58.580
 I think if we solve that, we'll solve everything.

24:58.580 --> 24:59.660
 I'm saying an open mind

24:59.660 --> 25:02.500
 because I think the biggest stumbling block

25:03.700 --> 25:05.940
 to understanding sort of the things

25:05.940 --> 25:07.660
 I've been trying to articulate,

25:07.660 --> 25:09.020
 and when I talk also with colleagues

25:09.020 --> 25:11.660
 that are thinking deeply about these same issues,

25:11.660 --> 25:15.440
 is none of it is inconsistent with what we know.

25:15.440 --> 25:18.260
 It's just such a radically different perception

25:18.260 --> 25:19.700
 of the way we understand things now

25:19.700 --> 25:21.340
 that it's hard for people to get there.

25:21.340 --> 25:23.140
 And in some ways you have to almost forget

25:23.140 --> 25:25.900
 what you've learned in order to learn something new, right?

25:25.900 --> 25:27.900
 So I feel like most of my career

25:27.900 --> 25:29.920
 trying to understand the problem of life

25:29.920 --> 25:32.460
 has been variously forgetting

25:32.460 --> 25:35.620
 and then relearning things that I learned in physics.

25:35.620 --> 25:40.620
 And I think you have to have a capacity to learn things,

25:41.800 --> 25:44.460
 but then accept that things that you learned

25:44.460 --> 25:49.460
 might not be true or might need refinement or reframing.

25:51.900 --> 25:53.300
 And the best way I can say that

25:53.300 --> 25:54.660
 is just like with a physics education,

25:54.660 --> 25:56.900
 there are just certain things you're told in undergrad

25:56.900 --> 25:58.980
 that are like facts about the world.

25:58.980 --> 26:01.300
 And your physics professors never tell you

26:01.300 --> 26:04.300
 that those facts actually emerge from a human mind, right?

26:04.300 --> 26:05.500
 So we're taught to think about,

26:05.500 --> 26:07.420
 say the laws of physics, for example,

26:07.420 --> 26:09.460
 as this like autonomous thing

26:09.460 --> 26:10.800
 that exists outside of our universe

26:10.800 --> 26:12.500
 and tells our universe how it works.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.500
 But the laws of physics were invented by human minds

26:15.500 --> 26:17.460
 to describe things that are regularities

26:17.460 --> 26:19.420
 in our everyday experience.

26:19.420 --> 26:21.620
 They don't exist autonomous to the universe.

26:21.620 --> 26:23.940
 Right, so it's like turtles on top of turtles,

26:23.940 --> 26:26.420
 but eventually it gets to the human mind,

26:26.420 --> 26:29.740
 and then you have to explain the human mind with the turtles.

26:29.740 --> 26:32.620
 So you have to, it comes from humans,

26:32.620 --> 26:34.740
 this understanding, this simplification of the universe,

26:34.740 --> 26:36.340
 these models.

26:36.340 --> 26:38.260
 There's a guy named Stephen Wolfram.

26:38.260 --> 26:42.020
 There's a concept called cellular automata.

26:42.020 --> 26:47.020
 So there's some mysteries in these systems

26:47.580 --> 26:49.420
 that are computational in nature

26:49.420 --> 26:54.020
 that have maybe echoes of the kind of mysteries

26:54.020 --> 26:57.820
 we should need to solve to understand what is life.

26:59.060 --> 27:04.060
 So if we could talk, take a computational view of things,

27:04.620 --> 27:06.220
 do you think there's something compelling

27:06.220 --> 27:09.860
 to reducing everything down to computation,

27:09.860 --> 27:12.060
 like the universe is computation,

27:12.060 --> 27:15.260
 and then trying to understand life?

27:15.260 --> 27:18.900
 So throw away the biology, throw away the chemistry,

27:18.900 --> 27:20.100
 throw away even the physics

27:20.100 --> 27:22.780
 that you learn undergrad and graduate school,

27:22.780 --> 27:25.940
 and more look at these simple little systems,

27:25.940 --> 27:28.340
 whether it's cellular automata or whatever the heck

27:28.340 --> 27:29.660
 kind of computational systems

27:29.660 --> 27:31.540
 that operate on simple local rules

27:31.540 --> 27:35.260
 and then create complexity as they evolve.

27:36.220 --> 27:39.460
 Is it at all, do you think, productive

27:39.460 --> 27:42.100
 to focus on those kinds of systems

27:42.100 --> 27:44.220
 to get an inkling of what is life?

27:44.220 --> 27:48.740
 And if it is, do you think it's possible

27:48.740 --> 27:51.620
 to come up with some kind of laws and principles

27:51.620 --> 27:56.140
 about what makes life in those computational systems?

27:56.140 --> 27:57.460
 So I like cellular automata.

27:57.460 --> 27:59.580
 I think they're good toy models,

27:59.580 --> 28:02.620
 but mostly where I've thought about them and used them

28:02.620 --> 28:07.420
 is to actually, let's say,

28:07.420 --> 28:10.380
 poke at sort of the current conceptual framework

28:10.380 --> 28:13.180
 that we have and see where the flaws are.

28:13.180 --> 28:15.660
 So I think the part that you're talking about

28:15.660 --> 28:17.260
 that people find intriguing is that

28:17.260 --> 28:19.660
 if you have a fairly simple rule

28:19.660 --> 28:21.580
 and you specify some initial condition

28:21.580 --> 28:23.460
 and you run that rule on that initial condition,

28:23.460 --> 28:26.460
 you could get really complex patterns emerging.

28:26.460 --> 28:28.980
 And ooh, doesn't that look lifelike?

28:28.980 --> 28:29.820
 Yeah.

28:29.820 --> 28:31.140
 Yeah.

28:31.140 --> 28:32.220
 Well, it's like really surprising,

28:32.220 --> 28:33.060
 isn't it really surprising?

28:33.060 --> 28:35.180
 It is really surprising, and they're beautiful.

28:35.180 --> 28:37.740
 And I think they have a lot of nice features

28:37.740 --> 28:39.660
 associated to them.

28:39.660 --> 28:42.260
 I think the things that I find,

28:42.260 --> 28:46.420
 yeah, so I do think as a proof of principle

28:46.420 --> 28:49.020
 that you can get complex things emerging from simple rules.

28:49.020 --> 28:50.420
 They're great.

28:50.420 --> 28:53.660
 As a sort of proof of principle about some of the ways

28:53.660 --> 28:56.700
 that we might think of computation

28:56.700 --> 28:59.380
 as being sort of a fundamental principle

28:59.380 --> 29:00.700
 for dynamical systems

29:00.700 --> 29:03.220
 and maybe the evolution of the universe as a whole,

29:03.220 --> 29:05.620
 they're a great model system.

29:05.620 --> 29:07.820
 As an explanatory framework for life,

29:07.820 --> 29:10.860
 I think they're a bit problematic

29:10.860 --> 29:14.060
 for the same reason that the laws of physics

29:14.060 --> 29:16.260
 are a bit problematic.

29:16.260 --> 29:19.260
 And the clearest way I can articulate that

29:19.260 --> 29:22.380
 is like cellular automata are actually cast

29:22.380 --> 29:24.820
 in sort of a conceptual framework

29:24.820 --> 29:26.500
 for how the universe should be described

29:26.500 --> 29:29.580
 that goes all the way back to Newton, in fact,

29:29.580 --> 29:33.660
 with this idea that we can have a fixed law of motion,

29:33.660 --> 29:36.060
 which exists sort of, it's given to you.

29:37.420 --> 29:40.420
 The great programmer in the sky gave you this equation

29:40.420 --> 29:43.340
 or this rule, and then you just run with it.

29:43.340 --> 29:45.020
 And the rule doesn't have,

29:45.020 --> 29:46.540
 so a good feature of the rule

29:46.540 --> 29:49.140
 is it doesn't have specified in the rule

29:49.140 --> 29:51.020
 information about the patterns it generates.

29:51.020 --> 29:53.780
 So you wouldn't want, for example,

29:53.780 --> 29:56.940
 my cup or my water bottle or me sitting here

29:56.940 --> 29:58.580
 to be specified in the laws of physics.

29:58.580 --> 29:59.420
 That would be ridiculous

29:59.420 --> 30:01.140
 because it wouldn't be a very simple explanation

30:01.140 --> 30:01.980
 of all the things happening.

30:01.980 --> 30:03.540
 It'd have to explain everything.

30:03.540 --> 30:06.100
 So, and cellular automata have that feature

30:06.100 --> 30:08.380
 and the laws of physics have that feature.

30:09.300 --> 30:13.060
 But you also need to specify the initial condition.

30:13.060 --> 30:15.380
 And it also, it basically means

30:15.380 --> 30:17.020
 that everything that happens

30:17.020 --> 30:19.860
 is sort of a consequence of that initial condition.

30:19.860 --> 30:21.740
 And I think this kind of framework

30:21.740 --> 30:25.020
 is just not the right one for biology.

30:25.020 --> 30:28.220
 And part of the way that it's easiest to see this

30:28.220 --> 30:31.820
 is a lot of people talk about self reference

30:31.820 --> 30:33.420
 being important in life.

30:33.420 --> 30:35.300
 The fact that, you know,

30:35.300 --> 30:39.220
 like the genome has information encoded in it,

30:39.220 --> 30:41.660
 that information gets read out.

30:41.660 --> 30:45.100
 It specifies something about the architecture of a cell.

30:45.100 --> 30:47.020
 The architecture of the cell includes the genome.

30:47.020 --> 30:49.780
 So the genome has basically self referential information.

30:49.780 --> 30:52.980
 Self reference obviously comes up in computational law

30:52.980 --> 30:56.660
 because it's kind of foundational to Turing's work

30:56.660 --> 30:58.900
 and what Gödel did with the incompleteness theorems

30:58.900 --> 30:59.740
 and things.

30:59.740 --> 31:02.540
 So there's a lot of parallels there

31:02.540 --> 31:05.380
 and people have talked about that at depth.

31:05.380 --> 31:06.780
 But the other way of kind of thinking about it

31:06.780 --> 31:10.060
 in terms of like a more physicsy way of talking about it

31:10.060 --> 31:12.220
 is that what it looks like in biology

31:12.220 --> 31:15.860
 is that the rules or the laws depend on the state.

31:15.860 --> 31:17.260
 This is typical in computer science.

31:17.260 --> 31:18.460
 This is obvious to you.

31:18.460 --> 31:19.780
 You know, the update rule depends

31:19.780 --> 31:20.900
 on the state of the machine, right?

31:20.900 --> 31:24.740
 But, you know, you don't think about, you know,

31:24.740 --> 31:27.500
 that being sort of the dynamic in physics.

31:27.500 --> 31:28.900
 It's, you know, the rules given to you

31:28.900 --> 31:32.660
 and then it's a very special subclass say of computations

31:32.660 --> 31:36.540
 if, you know, you don't ever change the update.

31:36.540 --> 31:38.300
 But in biology, it seems to be that the state

31:38.300 --> 31:40.980
 and the law change together as a function of time

31:40.980 --> 31:43.740
 and we don't have that as a paradigm in physics.

31:43.740 --> 31:45.620
 And so a lot of people talk about this

31:45.620 --> 31:47.540
 as being kind of a perplexing feature

31:47.540 --> 31:49.740
 that maybe there are certain scenarios

31:49.740 --> 31:51.140
 where the laws of physics

31:51.140 --> 31:52.980
 or the laws that govern a particular system

31:52.980 --> 31:56.580
 actually change as a function of the state of that system.

31:56.580 --> 31:57.420
 That's trippy.

31:57.420 --> 31:58.260
 Yeah.

31:58.260 --> 32:01.660
 So yeah, the hope of physics, it's a hope, I guess,

32:01.660 --> 32:05.340
 but often stated as a underlying assumption

32:05.340 --> 32:08.740
 is that the law is static.

32:08.740 --> 32:10.100
 Right.

32:10.100 --> 32:10.940
 Okay.

32:10.940 --> 32:12.580
 And even having laws that vary in time

32:12.580 --> 32:16.220
 and not even as a function of the state is very radical.

32:16.220 --> 32:17.060
 When you...

32:17.060 --> 32:20.020
 The time in general, like you wanna remove time

32:20.020 --> 32:22.020
 from the equation as much as possible.

32:22.020 --> 32:24.220
 Yeah, I do.

32:24.220 --> 32:25.580
 There's some interesting things in this

32:25.580 --> 32:28.020
 like when we think sort of more deeply

32:28.020 --> 32:29.980
 about the actual physics that we're trying to propose

32:29.980 --> 32:32.660
 governs life with me with collaborators

32:32.660 --> 32:35.160
 and then also other people that think about similar things

32:35.160 --> 32:36.760
 that time might actually be fundamental

32:36.760 --> 32:38.900
 and there really is an ordering to time.

32:38.900 --> 32:41.020
 And that events in the universe are unique

32:41.020 --> 32:43.980
 because they have a particular, they happen,

32:43.980 --> 32:45.180
 like an object in the universe

32:45.180 --> 32:48.300
 requires a certain history of events in order to exist,

32:48.300 --> 32:49.300
 which therefore suggests

32:49.300 --> 32:50.580
 that time really does have an ordering.

32:50.580 --> 32:51.420
 I'm not talking about the flow of time

32:51.420 --> 32:53.660
 and our perception of time, just the ordering of events.

32:53.660 --> 32:54.500
 Causation of things.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.660
 Yes, causation, there's that word again.

32:56.660 --> 32:59.460
 So causation, that's when you say time, you mean causation.

32:59.460 --> 33:00.780
 Yes.

33:00.780 --> 33:05.780
 In your proposed model of the physics of life,

33:05.820 --> 33:08.300
 the fundamental thing would be causation.

33:08.300 --> 33:09.740
 If you were to bet your money

33:09.740 --> 33:12.440
 on one particular horse or whatever.

33:12.440 --> 33:13.280
 Yes.

33:13.280 --> 33:15.480
 And then space is emergent.

33:15.480 --> 33:16.320
 Yes.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.260
 So everything's emergent except time.

33:19.140 --> 33:21.060
 Kind of, yeah, or causation.

33:21.060 --> 33:22.700
 And laws change all the time.

33:22.700 --> 33:24.260
 Why does it look like laws are the same?

33:24.260 --> 33:27.940
 Laws, well, because, well, one way,

33:27.940 --> 33:29.980
 and I actually, this idea comes from Lee Cronin

33:29.980 --> 33:31.860
 because I work with him very closely on these things,

33:31.860 --> 33:33.780
 is that the laws of physics look the way they do

33:33.780 --> 33:35.580
 because they're low memory laws.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.860
 So they don't require a lot of information to specify them.

33:37.860 --> 33:39.740
 They're very easy for the universe to implement.

33:39.740 --> 33:42.100
 But if you get something like me, for example,

33:42.100 --> 33:44.560
 I require 4 billion year history to exist in the universe.

33:44.560 --> 33:47.100
 I come with a lot of historical baggage.

33:47.100 --> 33:48.400
 And that's part of what I am

33:48.400 --> 33:50.700
 as a set of causes that exist in the universe.

33:52.680 --> 33:55.220
 So I have local rules that apply to me

33:55.220 --> 33:57.020
 that are associated with sort of the information

33:57.020 --> 33:59.220
 in my history that aren't universal

33:59.220 --> 34:01.020
 to every object in the universe.

34:01.020 --> 34:03.820
 And there are some things that are very easy

34:03.820 --> 34:06.020
 to implement low memory rules

34:06.020 --> 34:08.780
 that apply to everything in the universe.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.540
 So there's no shortcuts to you.

34:10.540 --> 34:13.580
 No, so yeah, I don't believe in things like Boltzmann brains

34:13.580 --> 34:17.260
 or fluctuations out of the vacuum

34:17.260 --> 34:19.700
 that can produce things like your desk ornaments.

34:21.420 --> 34:23.380
 I actually think they require

34:23.380 --> 34:25.620
 a particular causal chain of events to exist.

34:26.460 --> 34:28.580
 Well, I appreciate the togetherness of that,

34:28.580 --> 34:31.020
 but so how does that,

34:31.020 --> 34:34.020
 if we have to simulate the entire universe

34:34.020 --> 34:37.060
 to create the ornaments in the two of us,

34:37.060 --> 34:42.060
 how are we supposed to create engineer life in the lab?

34:42.860 --> 34:45.440
 This goes back to sort of the critique of the RNA world.

34:45.440 --> 34:46.940
 I think one of the problems,

34:46.940 --> 34:48.340
 and I'll get to answer your question,

34:48.340 --> 34:50.300
 but I think this is kind of relevant here.

34:50.300 --> 34:52.820
 One of the problems with the RNA world,

34:52.820 --> 34:54.260
 when we test it in the laboratory,

34:54.260 --> 34:57.300
 is how much information we're putting into the experiment.

34:57.300 --> 35:00.060
 We specify the flasks, we make pure reagents,

35:00.060 --> 35:01.860
 we mix them, we take them out,

35:01.860 --> 35:03.420
 we put them in the next flask,

35:03.420 --> 35:05.620
 we change the pH, we change the UV light,

35:05.620 --> 35:07.100
 and then we get a molecule,

35:07.100 --> 35:09.060
 and it's not even an RNA molecule necessarily,

35:09.060 --> 35:11.140
 it might just be a base, right?

35:11.140 --> 35:14.680
 And so people don't usually think about the fact

35:14.680 --> 35:17.860
 that we're agents in the universe making that experiment,

35:17.860 --> 35:19.460
 and therefore we put a little bit of life

35:19.460 --> 35:20.520
 into that experiment,

35:21.860 --> 35:23.740
 because it's part of our biological lineage,

35:23.740 --> 35:26.820
 in the same sense that I am a part of the biological lineage.

35:26.820 --> 35:27.660
 The experiment is.

35:27.660 --> 35:31.140
 I mean, our ideas are injecting life.

35:31.140 --> 35:31.980
 Yes.

35:31.980 --> 35:34.140
 And the constraints that we put on the experiments,

35:34.140 --> 35:36.740
 because those conditions wouldn't exist in the universe

35:36.740 --> 35:38.580
 on planet Earth at that time

35:38.580 --> 35:40.420
 without us as the boundary condition, right?

35:40.420 --> 35:41.420
 So.

35:41.420 --> 35:42.780
 Even though we're not actually adding

35:42.780 --> 35:45.160
 any actual chemistry or biology

35:45.160 --> 35:47.660
 that could be identified as life,

35:47.660 --> 35:49.860
 are the constraints we're adding to the experiment,

35:49.860 --> 35:51.300
 the design of the experiment.

35:51.300 --> 35:53.080
 Yeah, you can think of the design experiment as a program.

35:53.080 --> 35:54.340
 You put information in.

35:54.340 --> 35:57.180
 It's an algorithmic procedure that you design the experiment.

35:57.180 --> 35:59.940
 And so the origin of life problem

35:59.940 --> 36:02.740
 becomes one of minimizing the information

36:02.740 --> 36:04.900
 we put into physics

36:04.900 --> 36:07.140
 to actually watch the spontaneous origin of life.

36:07.140 --> 36:09.860
 Can we have, so can, is it possible in the lab

36:09.860 --> 36:12.180
 to have an information vacuum then?

36:12.180 --> 36:13.020
 So like.

36:13.020 --> 36:14.980
 If we could, we would, that would be amazing.

36:14.980 --> 36:15.820
 I don't know.

36:15.820 --> 36:17.700
 That's a good question for, more for Lee.

36:17.700 --> 36:18.700
 Yeah, you guys, by the way,

36:18.700 --> 36:21.260
 for people who don't know, Lee Cronin is,

36:21.260 --> 36:23.020
 you guys are colleagues.

36:23.020 --> 36:23.860
 Yeah.

36:23.860 --> 36:26.980
 I've gotten the chance to listen to the two of you talking.

36:26.980 --> 36:28.300
 There's great sort of chemistry

36:28.300 --> 36:30.580
 and you're brilliant brainstorming together.

36:30.580 --> 36:34.420
 And there's a really exciting community here

36:34.420 --> 36:36.900
 of brilliant people from different disciplines

36:36.900 --> 36:39.820
 working on the problem of life, of complexity,

36:39.820 --> 36:42.420
 of, I don't know, whatever.

36:42.420 --> 36:45.220
 The words fail us to describe the exact problem

36:45.220 --> 36:47.340
 we're trying to actually understand here.

36:47.340 --> 36:49.300
 Intelligence, all those kinds of things.

36:49.300 --> 36:54.300
 Okay, so what, from a lab perspective,

36:54.660 --> 36:57.260
 so Lee, I guess, would you call him a chemist?

36:57.260 --> 36:58.100
 No?

36:58.100 --> 36:59.580
 I think by training he's a chemist,

36:59.580 --> 37:01.140
 but I think most of the people that work in the field,

37:01.140 --> 37:02.700
 we do have lost their discipline.

37:02.700 --> 37:06.260
 That's why I couldn't answer your question earlier.

37:06.260 --> 37:07.100
 Okay.

37:07.100 --> 37:07.940
 I don't know what you call him.

37:07.940 --> 37:08.780
 Yeah.

37:08.780 --> 37:09.620
 I don't know what I call myself.

37:09.620 --> 37:11.300
 I don't know what I call any of my friends.

37:11.300 --> 37:15.140
 So why is it so hard to create,

37:15.140 --> 37:16.380
 and it's an interesting question,

37:16.380 --> 37:19.380
 to create biological life in the lab.

37:19.380 --> 37:21.780
 Like from your perspective,

37:21.780 --> 37:23.980
 is that an important problem to work on

37:23.980 --> 37:28.980
 to try to recreate the historical origin of life on Earth

37:29.180 --> 37:31.100
 or echoes of the historical origin?

37:31.100 --> 37:32.740
 I think echoes is more appropriate.

37:32.740 --> 37:34.900
 I don't think asking the question

37:34.900 --> 37:37.660
 of what was the exact historical sequence of events

37:37.660 --> 37:40.420
 and engineering every step in the process

37:40.420 --> 37:44.060
 to make exactly the chemistry of life on Earth as we know it

37:44.060 --> 37:46.340
 is a meaningful way of asking the question.

37:46.340 --> 37:47.820
 And it's a little bit like,

37:49.660 --> 37:50.980
 since you're in computer science,

37:50.980 --> 37:53.420
 like if you know the answer to a problem,

37:53.420 --> 37:56.020
 it's easier to find a program to specify the output, right?

37:56.020 --> 37:58.340
 But if you don't know the answer a priori,

37:58.340 --> 37:59.740
 finding an algorithm for it,

37:59.740 --> 38:01.020
 like say finding a prime or something,

38:01.020 --> 38:04.980
 it's easy to verify it's a prime number.

38:04.980 --> 38:07.500
 It's hard to find the next prime.

38:07.500 --> 38:10.940
 And the way the origin of life is structured right now

38:10.940 --> 38:14.260
 in the historical problem is you know the answer

38:14.260 --> 38:16.460
 and you're trying to retrodict it by breaking it down

38:16.460 --> 38:17.580
 into the set of procedures

38:17.580 --> 38:19.420
 where you're putting a lot of information in.

38:19.420 --> 38:21.700
 And what we need to do is ask the question

38:21.700 --> 38:26.140
 of how is it that the rules of how our universe is structured

38:26.140 --> 38:28.060
 permit things like life to exist

38:28.060 --> 38:29.740
 and what is the phenomena of life?

38:29.740 --> 38:31.380
 And those questions are obviously

38:31.380 --> 38:33.060
 essentially the same question.

38:33.060 --> 38:37.820
 And so you're looking essentially for this missing physics,

38:37.820 --> 38:39.700
 this missing explanation for what we are,

38:39.700 --> 38:41.700
 and you need to set up proper experiments

38:41.700 --> 38:43.500
 that are gonna allow you to probe

38:43.500 --> 38:47.420
 the vast complexity of chemistry in an unconstrained way

38:47.420 --> 38:50.180
 with as little information put in as possible

38:50.180 --> 38:53.900
 to see when things, when does information actually emerge?

38:53.900 --> 38:55.300
 How does it emerge?

38:55.300 --> 38:56.140
 What is it?

38:57.260 --> 39:00.260
 And part of the sort of conjecture we have

39:00.260 --> 39:03.140
 is that this physics only becomes relevant

39:03.140 --> 39:05.780
 or at least this is my personal conjecture

39:05.780 --> 39:08.500
 and it's sort of validated

39:08.500 --> 39:10.780
 by this kind of theory experiment collaboration

39:10.780 --> 39:15.300
 that we have working in this area that this, you know,

39:15.300 --> 39:17.420
 sort of, I made the point about like gravity

39:17.420 --> 39:18.580
 existing everywhere, right?

39:18.580 --> 39:21.260
 But when you study an atomic nucleus,

39:21.260 --> 39:22.340
 you don't care about gravity.

39:22.340 --> 39:23.980
 It's not relevant physics there, right?

39:23.980 --> 39:26.020
 It's weak, it doesn't matter.

39:26.020 --> 39:30.620
 And so this idea that there's kind of a physics

39:30.620 --> 39:32.780
 associated with information,

39:32.780 --> 39:36.260
 for me, it's very evident that that physics

39:36.260 --> 39:38.940
 doesn't become relevant until you need information

39:38.940 --> 39:41.620
 to specify the existence of a particular object.

39:41.620 --> 39:44.140
 And the scale of reality where that happens

39:44.140 --> 39:47.620
 is in chemistry because of the combinatorial diversity

39:47.620 --> 39:50.980
 of chemical objects that can exist far out,

39:50.980 --> 39:53.740
 exceeds the amount of resources in our universe.

39:53.740 --> 39:56.620
 So if you want it, you can't make every possible protein

39:56.620 --> 39:59.460
 of length, you know, 200 amino acids,

39:59.460 --> 40:00.900
 there's not enough resources.

40:00.900 --> 40:04.100
 So in order for this particular protein to exist

40:04.100 --> 40:06.660
 and this protein to exist in high abundance

40:06.660 --> 40:10.140
 means that you have to have a system that has knowledge

40:10.140 --> 40:12.900
 of the existence of that protein and can build it.

40:12.900 --> 40:15.580
 So existence comes to be at the chemical level.

40:15.580 --> 40:19.660
 So existence is most, is best understood

40:19.660 --> 40:20.700
 at the chemical level.

40:20.700 --> 40:22.060
 It's most evident.

40:22.060 --> 40:24.260
 It's a little bit like, nobody argues that gravity

40:24.260 --> 40:25.820
 doesn't exist in an atomic nucleus.

40:25.820 --> 40:27.820
 It's just not relevant physics there, right?

40:27.820 --> 40:29.860
 So the physics of information.

40:29.860 --> 40:30.700
 Is everywhere.

40:30.700 --> 40:32.500
 It exists at every combinatorial scale,

40:32.500 --> 40:34.180
 but it becomes more and more relevant

40:34.180 --> 40:36.740
 the more set of possibilities that could exist

40:36.740 --> 40:39.340
 because you have to specify more and more

40:39.340 --> 40:41.780
 about why this thing exists and not the infinite.

40:41.780 --> 40:43.340
 It's not an infinite set, but you know,

40:43.340 --> 40:46.140
 the set of undefined set of other things that could exist.

40:46.140 --> 40:50.540
 So can I ask a weird question, which is,

40:50.540 --> 40:52.300
 so let's look into the future.

40:53.580 --> 40:54.420
 I try that every day.

40:54.420 --> 40:55.260
 It never works.

40:56.180 --> 41:00.100
 So say a Nobel prize is given in physics,

41:00.100 --> 41:05.100
 maybe chemistry for discovering the origin of life.

41:06.540 --> 41:09.140
 No, but not the historical origin.

41:09.140 --> 41:11.420
 Some kind of thing that we're talking about.

41:12.620 --> 41:17.620
 What exactly would, what do you think that,

41:19.900 --> 41:22.460
 like, what do you think that person,

41:22.460 --> 41:24.700
 maybe you did to get that Nobel prize?

41:24.700 --> 41:26.220
 Like what would they have to have done?

41:26.220 --> 41:28.380
 Cause you can do a bunch of experiments that go

41:28.380 --> 41:30.620
 like within the aha moment.

41:30.620 --> 41:34.540
 Like you rarely get the Nobel prize for like,

41:34.540 --> 41:37.060
 you've solved everything, we're done.

41:37.060 --> 41:40.900
 It's like some inkling of some deep truth.

41:40.900 --> 41:43.220
 Like what do you think that would actually look like?

41:43.220 --> 41:45.140
 Would it be an experimental result?

41:46.380 --> 41:48.820
 I mean, it will have to have some kind of experimental,

41:48.820 --> 41:50.300
 maybe validation component.

41:50.300 --> 41:52.260
 So what would that look like?

41:52.260 --> 41:54.620
 This is an excellent question.

41:54.620 --> 41:57.220
 I want to, sorry, I'm going to make a quick point,

41:57.220 --> 41:58.700
 which is just a slight tangent.

41:58.700 --> 42:01.220
 But you know, like when people ask about the origin of mass,

42:01.220 --> 42:03.260
 and like looking for the Higgs mechanism and things,

42:03.260 --> 42:04.220
 they never are like,

42:04.220 --> 42:06.300
 we need to find the historical origins of life

42:06.300 --> 42:07.140
 in the early unit.

42:07.140 --> 42:08.380
 Although those things are related, right?

42:08.380 --> 42:11.420
 So this problem of origins of life in the lab,

42:11.420 --> 42:12.580
 I think is really important.

42:12.580 --> 42:14.500
 But the Higgs is a good example

42:14.500 --> 42:15.940
 because you had theory to guide it.

42:15.940 --> 42:19.340
 So somehow you need to have an explanatory framework

42:20.420 --> 42:24.700
 that can say that we should be looking for these features

42:24.700 --> 42:27.300
 and explain why they might be there

42:27.300 --> 42:28.980
 and then be able to do the experiment

42:28.980 --> 42:30.980
 and demonstrate that it matches with the theory.

42:30.980 --> 42:33.740
 But it has to be something that is outside

42:33.740 --> 42:35.740
 sort of the paradigm of what we might expect

42:35.740 --> 42:36.940
 based on what we know, right?

42:36.940 --> 42:39.860
 So this is a really sort of tall order.

42:39.860 --> 42:44.860
 And I think, I mean, I guess the way people would think

42:45.540 --> 42:46.380
 about it is like, you know,

42:46.380 --> 42:48.780
 if you had a bacteria that climbed out of your test tube

42:48.780 --> 42:49.980
 or something, and it was like, you know,

42:49.980 --> 42:51.100
 moving around on the surface,

42:51.100 --> 42:52.460
 that would be ultimate validation.

42:52.460 --> 42:54.580
 You saw the origin of life in an experiment,

42:54.580 --> 42:56.900
 but I don't think that's quite what we're looking for.

42:56.900 --> 43:01.420
 I think what we're looking for is evidence

43:01.420 --> 43:05.500
 of when information that originated

43:05.500 --> 43:07.900
 within the bounds of your experiment

43:07.900 --> 43:11.460
 and you can demonstrably prove emerged spontaneously

43:11.460 --> 43:14.100
 in your experiment, wasn't put in by you,

43:14.100 --> 43:17.260
 actually started to govern the future dynamics

43:17.260 --> 43:19.620
 of that system and specify it.

43:19.620 --> 43:23.540
 And you could somehow relate those two features directly.

43:23.540 --> 43:26.260
 So you know that the program specifying

43:26.260 --> 43:27.540
 what's happening in that system

43:27.540 --> 43:29.700
 is actually internal to that system.

43:29.700 --> 43:32.100
 Like say you have a chemical thing in a box.

43:32.100 --> 43:36.340
 Well, so that's one Nobel Prize winning experiment,

43:36.340 --> 43:39.920
 which is like information in some fundamental way

43:39.920 --> 43:42.860
 originated within the constraints of the system

43:42.860 --> 43:44.600
 without you injecting anything.

43:44.600 --> 43:49.180
 But another experiment is you injected something.

43:49.180 --> 43:50.100
 Yeah.

43:50.100 --> 43:52.100
 And got out information.

43:52.100 --> 43:52.940
 Yes.

43:52.940 --> 43:55.740
 So like you injected, I don't know,

43:55.740 --> 44:00.740
 like some sugar and like something that doesn't necessarily

44:01.260 --> 44:03.420
 feel like it should be information.

44:03.420 --> 44:05.940
 Yeah, so I actually know, I mean,

44:05.940 --> 44:07.140
 sugar is information, right?

44:07.140 --> 44:10.120
 So part of the argument here is that every physical object

44:10.120 --> 44:12.880
 is, well, it's information,

44:12.880 --> 44:14.580
 but it's a set of causal histories

44:14.580 --> 44:16.620
 and also a set of possible futures.

44:16.620 --> 44:20.500
 So there is an experiment that I've talked a lot about

44:20.500 --> 44:22.100
 with Lee Cronin, but also with Michael Lockman

44:22.100 --> 44:23.900
 and Chris Kempis who are at Santa Fe

44:23.900 --> 44:25.780
 about this idea that sometimes we talk about

44:25.780 --> 44:27.900
 as like seeding assembly,

44:27.900 --> 44:30.560
 which is you take a high complexity,

44:30.560 --> 44:32.860
 like an object that exists in the universe

44:32.860 --> 44:34.900
 because of a long causal history,

44:34.900 --> 44:38.500
 and you seed it into a system of lower causal history.

44:38.500 --> 44:40.860
 And then suddenly you see all of this complexity

44:40.860 --> 44:41.980
 being generated.

44:41.980 --> 44:44.980
 So I think another validation of the physics would be,

44:44.980 --> 44:46.940
 say you engineer an organism

44:46.940 --> 44:49.740
 by purposefully introducing something

44:49.740 --> 44:51.220
 where you understand the relationship

44:51.220 --> 44:54.080
 between the causal history of the organism

44:54.080 --> 44:57.580
 and the say very complex chemical set of ingredients

44:57.580 --> 44:58.820
 you're adding to it.

44:58.820 --> 45:01.980
 And then you can predict the future evolution of that system

45:01.980 --> 45:06.920
 to some statistical set of constraints and possibilities

45:06.920 --> 45:10.100
 for what it will look like in the future.

45:11.620 --> 45:12.900
 I'm a physical structure, obviously,

45:12.900 --> 45:15.220
 like I'm composed of atoms,

45:15.220 --> 45:16.660
 the configuration of them

45:16.660 --> 45:19.380
 and the fact that they happen to be me

45:19.380 --> 45:22.060
 is because I'm not actually my atoms,

45:22.060 --> 45:24.680
 I am a informational pattern

45:24.680 --> 45:28.940
 that keeps re patterning those atoms into Sarah.

45:28.940 --> 45:32.060
 And I have also associated to me

45:32.060 --> 45:36.220
 like a space of possible things that could exist

45:36.220 --> 45:38.200
 that I can help mediate come into existence

45:38.200 --> 45:41.240
 because of the information in my history.

45:41.240 --> 45:45.720
 And so when you understand sort of that

45:45.720 --> 45:49.140
 time is a real thing embedded in a physical object,

45:50.080 --> 45:52.920
 then it becomes possible to talk about

45:52.920 --> 45:56.960
 how histories when they interact

45:56.960 --> 45:58.420
 and a history is not a unique thing,

45:58.420 --> 45:59.900
 it's a set of possibilities.

45:59.900 --> 46:00.740
 When they interact,

46:00.740 --> 46:03.200
 how do they specify what's coming next?

46:03.200 --> 46:05.280
 And then where does the novelty come from in that structure?

46:05.280 --> 46:06.600
 Cause some of it is kind of things

46:06.600 --> 46:09.940
 that haven't existed in the past can exist in the future.

46:09.940 --> 46:12.800
 Let me ask about this entity that you call Sarah.

46:12.800 --> 46:14.120
 Yes.

46:14.120 --> 46:16.840
 I talk to myself about myself in third person sometimes.

46:16.840 --> 46:17.680
 I don't know why.

46:19.400 --> 46:22.400
 So maybe this is a good time to bring up consciousness.

46:22.400 --> 46:23.240
 Sure.

46:24.800 --> 46:26.600
 It's been here all along.

46:26.600 --> 46:28.200
 Well, has it?

46:28.200 --> 46:29.040
 So, I mean that's.

46:29.040 --> 46:30.520
 At least in this conversation,

46:30.520 --> 46:31.920
 I think I've been conscious most of it,

46:31.920 --> 46:32.760
 but maybe I haven't.

46:32.760 --> 46:33.600
 Well, yes.

46:33.600 --> 46:34.800
 So speak for yourself.

46:34.800 --> 46:37.960
 You're projecting your consciousness onto me.

46:37.960 --> 46:39.720
 You don't know if I'm conscious or not.

46:39.720 --> 46:41.060
 No, I don't.

46:41.060 --> 46:41.900
 You're right.

46:41.900 --> 46:45.120
 Is that, you talked about the physics of existence,

46:45.120 --> 46:50.120
 you talked about the emergence of causality,

46:50.120 --> 46:52.720
 sorry, you talked about causality and time

46:52.720 --> 46:54.540
 being fundamental to the universe.

46:55.520 --> 46:58.440
 Where does consciousness fit into all of this?

46:58.440 --> 47:03.160
 Like, do you draw any kind of inspiration or value

47:03.160 --> 47:05.400
 with the idea of panpsychism

47:05.400 --> 47:09.680
 that maybe one of the things that we ought to understand

47:09.680 --> 47:12.040
 is the physics of consciousness?

47:12.040 --> 47:16.680
 Like one of the missing pieces in the physics view

47:16.680 --> 47:20.460
 of the world is understanding the physics of consciousness.

47:20.460 --> 47:24.860
 Or like that word has so many concepts underneath it,

47:24.860 --> 47:29.120
 but let's put consciousness as a label

47:29.120 --> 47:32.320
 on a black box of mystery that we don't understand.

47:32.320 --> 47:36.560
 Do you think that black box holds the key

47:36.560 --> 47:38.920
 to finally answering the question

47:38.920 --> 47:40.760
 of the physics of life?

47:40.760 --> 47:42.280
 The problems are absolutely related.

47:42.280 --> 47:44.720
 I think most, and I'm interested in both

47:44.720 --> 47:46.320
 because I'm just interested in what we are.

47:46.320 --> 47:48.140
 And to me, the most interesting feature

47:48.140 --> 47:49.460
 of what we are is our minds

47:49.460 --> 47:51.320
 and the way they interact with our minds.

47:51.320 --> 47:52.680
 Like minds are the most beautiful thing

47:52.680 --> 47:53.560
 that exists in the universe.

47:53.560 --> 47:55.360
 So how do they come to be?

47:55.360 --> 47:56.240
 Sorry to interrupt.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.480
 So when you say we, you mean humans.

47:58.480 --> 48:01.560
 I mean humans right now, but that's because I'm a human.

48:01.560 --> 48:02.400
 Or at least I think I am.

48:02.400 --> 48:03.680
 But you think there's something special

48:03.680 --> 48:05.040
 to this particular?

48:05.040 --> 48:06.480
 No, no, no, no, no.

48:06.480 --> 48:11.280
 No, I'm not a human centric thinker.

48:11.280 --> 48:12.560
 But are you one entity?

48:12.560 --> 48:15.420
 You said a bunch of stuff came together to make a Sarah.

48:15.420 --> 48:18.200
 Like do you think of yourself as one entity

48:18.200 --> 48:20.760
 or are you just a bunch of different components?

48:20.760 --> 48:24.400
 Like is there any value to understand the physics of Sarah?

48:24.400 --> 48:26.360
 Or are you just a bunch of different things

48:26.360 --> 48:30.080
 that are like a nice little temporary side effect?

48:30.080 --> 48:33.040
 Yeah, you could think of me as a bundle of information

48:33.040 --> 48:34.840
 that just became temporarily aggregated

48:34.840 --> 48:36.520
 into your individual, yeah.

48:36.520 --> 48:37.340
 That's fine.

48:37.340 --> 48:38.320
 I agree with that view.

48:38.320 --> 48:42.200
 I'll take that as a compliment actually.

48:42.200 --> 48:46.560
 But nevertheless, that bundle of information

48:46.560 --> 48:47.840
 has become conscious.

48:47.840 --> 48:51.000
 Or at least keeps calling herself conscious.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.600
 Yeah, I think I'm conscious right now,

48:52.600 --> 48:55.100
 but I might not be, but that's okay.

48:55.100 --> 48:56.360
 Or you wouldn't know.

48:56.360 --> 48:57.720
 So yeah, so this is the problem.

48:57.720 --> 48:59.640
 So yeah, usually people when they're talking

48:59.640 --> 49:00.920
 about consciousness are worried

49:00.920 --> 49:02.280
 about the subjective experience.

49:02.280 --> 49:04.140
 And so I think that's why you're saying,

49:04.140 --> 49:05.100
 I don't know if you're conscious

49:05.100 --> 49:06.900
 because I don't know if you're experiencing

49:06.900 --> 49:08.300
 this conversation right now.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.480
 And nor do you know if I'm experiencing

49:11.480 --> 49:12.960
 the conversation right now.

49:12.960 --> 49:14.280
 And so this is why this is called

49:14.280 --> 49:15.400
 the hard problem of consciousness

49:15.400 --> 49:17.520
 because it seems impenetrable from the outside

49:17.520 --> 49:20.540
 to know if something's having a conscious experience.

49:21.500 --> 49:24.600
 And I really like the idea of also

49:24.600 --> 49:26.220
 like the hard problem of matter,

49:26.220 --> 49:28.940
 which is related to the hard problem of consciousness,

49:28.940 --> 49:31.600
 which is you don't know the intrinsic properties

49:31.600 --> 49:33.320
 of an electron not interacting,

49:33.320 --> 49:35.240
 say for example, with anything else in the universe.

49:35.240 --> 49:37.680
 All the properties of anything that exists

49:37.680 --> 49:39.480
 in the universe are defined by its interaction

49:39.480 --> 49:40.920
 because you have to interact with it

49:40.920 --> 49:42.440
 in order to be able to observe it.

49:42.440 --> 49:44.520
 So we can only actually know the things

49:44.520 --> 49:46.260
 that are observable from the outside.

49:46.260 --> 49:47.720
 And so this is one of the reasons

49:47.720 --> 49:49.400
 that consciousness is hard for science

49:49.400 --> 49:51.080
 because you're asking questions

49:51.080 --> 49:52.720
 about something that's subjective

49:52.720 --> 49:55.460
 and supposed to be intrinsic to what that thing is

49:55.460 --> 49:57.920
 as it exists and how it feels about existing.

49:59.200 --> 50:02.520
 And so I have thought a lot about this problem

50:02.520 --> 50:05.400
 and its relationship to the problem of life.

50:05.400 --> 50:07.160
 And the only thing I can come up with

50:07.160 --> 50:12.160
 to try to make that problem scientifically tractable

50:12.920 --> 50:17.920
 and also relate it to how I think about the physics of life

50:17.920 --> 50:20.320
 is to ask the question,

50:20.320 --> 50:23.480
 are there things that can only happen in the universe

50:23.480 --> 50:26.240
 because there are physical systems

50:26.240 --> 50:28.760
 that have subjective experience?

50:28.760 --> 50:32.640
 So does subjective experience have different causes

50:32.640 --> 50:35.040
 that things that it can cause to occur

50:36.320 --> 50:38.600
 that would happen in the absence of that?

50:38.600 --> 50:40.080
 I don't know the answer to that question,

50:40.080 --> 50:42.080
 but I think that's a meaningful way

50:42.080 --> 50:43.600
 of asking the question of consciousness.

50:43.600 --> 50:46.600
 I can't ask if you're having experience right now,

50:46.600 --> 50:49.160
 but I can ask if you having experience right now

50:49.160 --> 50:50.840
 changes something about you

50:50.840 --> 50:52.840
 and the way you interact with the world.

50:53.760 --> 50:56.400
 So does stuff happen?

50:56.400 --> 50:59.000
 It's a good question to ask, does stuff happen

50:59.000 --> 51:00.260
 if consciousness is?

51:01.360 --> 51:03.160
 Then it's a real physical thing, right?

51:03.160 --> 51:04.440
 It has physical consequences.

51:04.440 --> 51:05.640
 I'm a physicist, I'm biased,

51:05.640 --> 51:08.200
 so I can't get rid of that bias.

51:08.200 --> 51:10.320
 It's really deeply ingrained.

51:10.320 --> 51:12.080
 I've tried, but it's hard.

51:12.080 --> 51:14.640
 But I mean, you're saying information is physical too.

51:14.640 --> 51:16.400
 So like virtual reality, simulation,

51:16.400 --> 51:18.280
 all that program is physical too in the sense of.

51:18.280 --> 51:19.400
 Yes, everything's physical.

51:19.400 --> 51:22.900
 It's just not physical the way it's represented in our minds.

51:22.900 --> 51:25.520
 Right, so you, I love your Twitter.

51:25.520 --> 51:29.720
 So you tweet these like deep thoughts, deep thoughts.

51:29.720 --> 51:30.680
 That's what a theorist does

51:30.680 --> 51:32.320
 when she's trying to experiment.

51:33.320 --> 51:34.160
 Is tweet?

51:34.160 --> 51:35.000
 Yes.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.320
 It's just like sitting there.

51:36.320 --> 51:38.360
 I mean, I could just imagine you sitting there

51:38.360 --> 51:40.360
 for like hours and all of a sudden just like

51:40.360 --> 51:43.080
 this thought comes out and you get a little

51:44.440 --> 51:46.840
 like inkling into the thought process.

51:46.840 --> 51:48.840
 Yeah, usually it's like when I'm running between things

51:48.840 --> 51:50.960
 and not so much when I've had deep thoughts.

51:50.960 --> 51:52.280
 Well, yeah, so you.

51:52.280 --> 51:53.640
 Deep thoughts are hard to articulate.

51:53.640 --> 51:55.320
 One of the things you tweeted is,

51:55.320 --> 51:57.640
 ideologically, there are many parallels

51:57.640 --> 52:01.640
 between the search for neural correlates of consciousness

52:01.640 --> 52:04.260
 and for chemical correlates of life.

52:04.260 --> 52:07.480
 How the neuroscience and astrobiology communities

52:07.480 --> 52:10.460
 treat those correlates is entirely different.

52:10.460 --> 52:14.660
 Can you elaborate against this kind of the parallels?

52:14.660 --> 52:16.520
 It has to do a little bit with the consciousness

52:16.520 --> 52:20.080
 and the matter thing you're talking about.

52:20.080 --> 52:20.960
 Yeah, it does.

52:20.960 --> 52:23.000
 And I can't remember what state of mind I was

52:23.000 --> 52:24.400
 when I was actually thinking about that.

52:24.400 --> 52:27.120
 But I think part of it is.

52:27.120 --> 52:28.640
 I bet you never thought you were gonna have

52:28.640 --> 52:29.920
 to analyze your own tweets.

52:29.920 --> 52:31.040
 No, I didn't.

52:31.040 --> 52:35.120
 It's an interesting historical juxtaposition of thinking.

52:35.120 --> 52:38.200
 So the tweet is a historical.

52:38.200 --> 52:40.200
 You're doing an assembly experiment right now

52:40.200 --> 52:41.600
 because you're bringing a thought from the past

52:41.600 --> 52:43.240
 into the present and trying to actually.

52:43.240 --> 52:44.200
 In a lab.

52:44.200 --> 52:45.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:45.440 --> 52:47.560
 This is experimental science right here

52:47.560 --> 52:48.840
 on the podcast live.

52:51.040 --> 52:53.720
 So go, let's see how the consciousness evolves on this one.

52:53.720 --> 52:57.680
 Yeah, so in neuroscience, it's kind of accepted

52:57.680 --> 53:00.480
 that we can't get at the subjective aspect

53:00.480 --> 53:01.540
 of consciousness.

53:01.540 --> 53:05.280
 So people are very interested in what would be a correlate

53:05.280 --> 53:06.120
 of consciousness.

53:06.120 --> 53:06.960
 So.

53:08.840 --> 53:09.680
 What's a correlate?

53:09.680 --> 53:13.240
 A correlate is a feature that relates

53:13.240 --> 53:14.420
 to conscious activity.

53:14.420 --> 53:18.660
 So for example, a verbal report is a correlate

53:18.660 --> 53:22.880
 of consciousness because I can tell you when I'm conscious.

53:22.880 --> 53:25.000
 And then when I'm sleeping, for example,

53:25.000 --> 53:26.200
 I can't tell you I'm conscious.

53:26.200 --> 53:28.680
 So we have this assumption that you're not conscious

53:28.680 --> 53:31.840
 when you're sleeping and you're conscious when you're awake.

53:31.840 --> 53:35.480
 And so that's sort of like a very obvious example,

53:35.480 --> 53:38.840
 but neuroscientists, which I'm no neuroscientist

53:38.840 --> 53:40.120
 and I'm not an expert in this field.

53:40.120 --> 53:43.720
 So, but they have very sophisticated ways of measuring

53:43.720 --> 53:45.960
 activity in our brain and trying to relate that

53:45.960 --> 53:49.560
 to verbal report and other proxies for whether someone

53:49.560 --> 53:51.600
 is experiencing something.

53:51.600 --> 53:54.720
 And that's what is meant by neural correlates.

53:54.720 --> 53:57.320
 And then, so when people are trying to think

53:57.320 --> 54:02.320
 about studying consciousness or developing theories

54:02.400 --> 54:06.160
 for consciousness, they often are trying to build

54:06.160 --> 54:09.780
 an experimental bridge to these neural correlates,

54:09.780 --> 54:11.960
 recognizing the fact that a neural correlate

54:11.960 --> 54:15.120
 may or may not correspond to consciousness

54:15.120 --> 54:16.640
 because that problem's hard

54:16.640 --> 54:19.800
 and there's all these associated issues to it.

54:19.800 --> 54:22.120
 So that's, from a neuroscience perspective,

54:22.120 --> 54:23.560
 it's like fake it till you make it.

54:23.560 --> 54:24.760
 So you. Pretty much, yeah.

54:24.760 --> 54:27.600
 You fake whatever the correlates are and hopefully

54:27.600 --> 54:32.600
 that's going to summon the thing that is consciousness.

54:32.600 --> 54:33.440
 Yeah, something like that.

54:33.440 --> 54:37.960
 And so the same thing on the chemical correlates of life.

54:37.960 --> 54:39.880
 That sounds like, that's an awesome concept.

54:39.880 --> 54:41.240
 Is that something that people?

54:41.240 --> 54:42.280
 No, I just made that up.

54:42.280 --> 54:43.120
 Okay.

54:43.120 --> 54:43.960
 That was original to that tweet.

54:43.960 --> 54:45.600
 You can cite the tweet.

54:45.600 --> 54:48.300
 Maybe I'll write it in a paper someday.

54:48.300 --> 54:50.600
 Chemical correlates of life, that's a good title.

54:50.600 --> 54:52.920
 I mean, first of all, your paper is true

54:52.920 --> 54:55.520
 that people should check out, have great titles.

54:55.520 --> 54:56.360
 Thank you.

54:56.360 --> 54:58.120
 Or papers you're involved with.

54:58.120 --> 55:02.600
 So your tweets and titles are stellar and also your ideas,

55:02.600 --> 55:04.920
 but the tweets and titles are much more important.

55:04.920 --> 55:06.000
 Of course.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.600
 So. Ideas will live longer.

55:08.640 --> 55:10.000
 Yeah.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.240
 They're much more diffused though.

55:12.240 --> 55:13.960
 Well, it's, yeah, it's the Trojan,

55:13.960 --> 55:16.040
 the tweet is the Trojan horse of the idea

55:16.040 --> 55:18.020
 that sticks on for a long time.

55:18.020 --> 55:19.400
 Okay, so is there anything to say

55:19.400 --> 55:20.840
 about the chemical correlates of life?

55:20.840 --> 55:24.200
 You're saying they're similar kind of ways

55:24.200 --> 55:25.700
 of thinking about it,

55:25.700 --> 55:30.600
 but you mentioned about the communities.

55:30.600 --> 55:33.460
 Yeah, so I think in astrobiology, it's not,

55:35.500 --> 55:37.760
 there's no concept of chemical correlates of life.

55:37.760 --> 55:38.960
 We don't think about it that way.

55:38.960 --> 55:42.800
 We think if we find molecules that are involved in biology,

55:42.800 --> 55:44.480
 we found life.

55:44.480 --> 55:48.000
 So I think one of my motivations there

55:48.000 --> 55:49.200
 was just to separate the fact

55:49.200 --> 55:53.120
 that life has abstract properties associated to it.

55:53.120 --> 55:56.400
 They become imprinted in material substrates

55:57.320 --> 55:59.500
 and those substrates are correlates for that thing,

55:59.500 --> 56:00.840
 but they are not necessarily

56:00.840 --> 56:02.020
 the thing we're actually looking for.

56:02.020 --> 56:04.000
 The thing that we're looking for is the physics

56:04.000 --> 56:05.840
 that's organizing that system to begin with,

56:05.840 --> 56:07.280
 not the particular molecules.

56:08.320 --> 56:10.000
 In the same sense that, you know,

56:10.000 --> 56:13.200
 your consciousness is not your brain.

56:13.200 --> 56:16.740
 It's instantiated in your brain.

56:16.740 --> 56:18.760
 You know, it has to have a physical substrate,

56:18.760 --> 56:21.560
 but it's not, the matter is not the thing

56:21.560 --> 56:22.400
 that you're looking at.

56:22.400 --> 56:24.300
 It's some other, at least not in the way

56:24.300 --> 56:26.780
 that we have come to look at matter,

56:26.780 --> 56:28.600
 you know, with traditional physics and things.

56:28.600 --> 56:29.600
 There's something else there

56:29.600 --> 56:31.120
 and it might be this feature of history

56:31.120 --> 56:31.960
 I was talking about,

56:31.960 --> 56:33.840
 our time being actually, you know,

56:33.840 --> 56:35.840
 physically represented there.

56:35.840 --> 56:38.600
 Do you think consciousness can be engineered?

56:38.600 --> 56:40.060
 Yes.

56:40.060 --> 56:41.400
 In the same way that life can be engineered?

56:41.400 --> 56:42.400
 Well, that was a fast answer.

56:42.400 --> 56:43.360
 I didn't even think about that.

56:43.360 --> 56:44.640
 That's interesting.

56:44.640 --> 56:45.920
 You don't have a free will.

56:45.920 --> 56:46.760
 That was predestined.

56:46.760 --> 56:47.580
 No, I do have free will,

56:47.580 --> 56:48.420
 but it's interesting,

56:48.420 --> 56:50.920
 because I mean, you know,

56:50.920 --> 56:51.920
 Now you're backtracking.

56:51.920 --> 56:52.760
 No, no.

56:52.760 --> 56:53.720
 And that was predestined.

56:53.720 --> 56:55.760
 Yeah, no, no.

56:55.760 --> 56:56.960
 No, I do believe in free will,

56:56.960 --> 56:59.680
 but I also think that there's kind of an interesting,

57:00.640 --> 57:03.240
 you know, like what you're speaking about consciousness.

57:03.240 --> 57:04.560
 What are you consciously aware of

57:04.560 --> 57:07.540
 versus like what is your subconscious brain

57:07.540 --> 57:08.840
 actually processing and doing?

57:08.840 --> 57:12.080
 And sometimes there's conflict between your consciousness

57:12.080 --> 57:13.080
 and your subconsciousness

57:13.080 --> 57:14.840
 or your consciousness is a little slower

57:14.840 --> 57:16.180
 than your subconscious.

57:16.180 --> 57:18.720
 And intuition is a really important feature of that.

57:18.720 --> 57:20.520
 And so a lot of the ways I do my science

57:20.520 --> 57:22.280
 is guided by intuition.

57:22.280 --> 57:23.820
 So when I give fast answers like that,

57:23.820 --> 57:24.660
 I think it's usually

57:24.660 --> 57:25.760
 because I haven't really thought about them

57:25.760 --> 57:29.040
 and therefore that's probably telling me something.

57:29.040 --> 57:31.520
 Let's continue the deep analysis of your tweets.

57:33.280 --> 57:35.880
 You said that determinism in a tweet,

57:35.880 --> 57:38.520
 determinism and randomness play important roles

57:38.520 --> 57:40.560
 in understanding what life is.

57:40.560 --> 57:42.520
 So let me ask on this topic of free will,

57:42.520 --> 57:45.680
 what is determinism, what is randomness

57:45.680 --> 57:48.200
 and why the heck do they have anything to do

57:48.200 --> 57:50.240
 with understanding life?

57:50.240 --> 57:52.600
 Yeah, and you threw free will in there,

57:52.600 --> 57:55.000
 just throwing all the stuff in the bag.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.120
 Are they not related, determinism and randomness?

57:56.120 --> 57:58.080
 No, no, they are related.

57:58.080 --> 57:59.120
 No, no, that's all right.

57:59.120 --> 58:00.320
 I was being unfair.

58:00.320 --> 58:02.280
 You didn't even capitalize the tweet, by the way.

58:02.280 --> 58:03.540
 It was all lowercase.

58:03.540 --> 58:05.120
 I must've been angry.

58:05.120 --> 58:06.320
 Oh, that was saying,

58:06.320 --> 58:08.160
 can you analyze the emotion behind that?

58:08.160 --> 58:09.000
 No, I actually did.

58:09.000 --> 58:09.840
 Is it frustration or is it hope?

58:09.840 --> 58:10.860
 Yeah, maybe.

58:10.860 --> 58:14.200
 So I already argued that I don't think that can happen

58:14.200 --> 58:16.120
 without that whole causal history.

58:16.120 --> 58:18.440
 And so I guess in some sense,

58:18.440 --> 58:23.440
 the determinism for me arises because of the causal history.

58:23.440 --> 58:25.280
 And I'm not really sure actually

58:25.280 --> 58:29.000
 about whether the universe is random or deterministic.

58:29.000 --> 58:32.120
 I just had this sort of intuition for a long time.

58:32.120 --> 58:34.060
 I'm not sure if I agree with it anymore,

58:34.060 --> 58:35.360
 but it's still kind of lingering

58:35.360 --> 58:37.200
 and I don't know what to do with this question.

58:37.200 --> 58:39.000
 But it seems to me, you know,

58:39.000 --> 58:41.400
 so you asked the question, what is life?

58:41.400 --> 58:42.840
 But you could also, why life?

58:42.840 --> 58:43.680
 Why does life exist?

58:43.680 --> 58:45.600
 What does the universe need life for?

58:45.600 --> 58:46.800
 Not that the universe has needs,

58:46.800 --> 58:48.880
 but you know, we have to anthropocentrize things sometimes

58:48.880 --> 58:50.360
 to talk about them.

58:50.360 --> 58:53.840
 And I had this feeling that if it was possible

58:53.840 --> 58:57.240
 for a cup or a desk ornament or a phone on Mars

58:57.240 --> 58:59.520
 to spontaneously fluctuate into existence,

58:59.520 --> 59:01.760
 the universe didn't need life to create those objects.

59:01.760 --> 59:03.340
 It wasn't necessary for their existence.

59:03.340 --> 59:05.640
 It was just a random fluke event.

59:05.640 --> 59:06.880
 And so somehow to me,

59:06.880 --> 59:09.800
 it seems that it can't be that those things

59:09.800 --> 59:11.820
 formed by random processes,

59:11.820 --> 59:14.160
 they actually have to have a set of causes

59:14.160 --> 59:17.280
 that accrue and form those things

59:17.280 --> 59:18.820
 and they have to have that history.

59:18.820 --> 59:21.000
 And so it seems to me that that life

59:21.000 --> 59:24.080
 was somehow deeply related to the question

59:24.080 --> 59:26.560
 of whether the underlying rules of our universe

59:26.560 --> 59:29.080
 had randomness in them or they were fully deterministic.

59:29.080 --> 59:30.600
 And in some ways you can think about life

59:30.600 --> 59:33.880
 as being the most deterministic part of physics

59:33.880 --> 59:38.880
 because it's where the causes are precise in some sense.

59:39.320 --> 59:40.320
 Or most stable.

59:40.320 --> 59:41.160
 So like I'm trying...

59:41.160 --> 59:42.960
 Most stable, yes, most reliable.

59:42.960 --> 59:47.120
 Most reliable for the tools of physics.

59:47.120 --> 59:50.680
 But where's the randomness come from then?

59:50.680 --> 59:54.400
 Okay, so you were speaking with...

59:54.400 --> 59:55.760
 I've gone in a tangent,

59:55.760 --> 59:57.040
 so I'm not sure where we are in the...

59:57.040 --> 59:57.880
 Yeah.

59:58.840 --> 1:00:00.840
 All of the universe is a kind of tangent.

1:00:00.840 --> 1:00:03.320
 So we're embracing the tangent.

1:00:03.320 --> 1:00:08.240
 So free will, you believe at this current time

1:00:08.240 --> 1:00:09.400
 that you have free will.

1:00:09.400 --> 1:00:11.080
 I believe my whole life I have free will.

1:00:11.080 --> 1:00:11.920
 What is illusion?

1:00:11.920 --> 1:00:12.760
 No, just kidding.

1:00:12.760 --> 1:00:14.320
 I still believe it.

1:00:14.320 --> 1:00:15.160
 You still believe it.

1:00:15.160 --> 1:00:18.880
 So at the same time you think that

1:00:18.880 --> 1:00:20.840
 in your conception of the universe,

1:00:20.840 --> 1:00:23.160
 causality seems to be pretty fundamental.

1:00:23.160 --> 1:00:24.000
 That's right.

1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:27.360
 Which kind of wants the universe to be deterministic.

1:00:27.360 --> 1:00:31.220
 So how the heck do you think you have a free will

1:00:31.220 --> 1:00:33.340
 and yet you value causality?

1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:39.760
 Because I depart from the conception of physics

1:00:39.760 --> 1:00:42.760
 that you can write down an initial condition

1:00:42.760 --> 1:00:45.720
 and a fixed law of motion and that will describe everything.

1:00:45.720 --> 1:00:47.160
 There's no incompatibility

1:00:47.160 --> 1:00:49.520
 if you are willing to reject that assertion.

1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:51.160
 So where's the randomness?

1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:54.160
 Where's the magic that gives birth to the free will?

1:00:54.160 --> 1:00:56.840
 Is it the randomness of the laws of physics?

1:00:56.840 --> 1:01:00.080
 No, in my mind what free will is,

1:01:00.080 --> 1:01:03.240
 is the fact that I as a physical system

1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:05.360
 have causal control over certain things.

1:01:05.360 --> 1:01:06.960
 I don't have causal control over everything,

1:01:06.960 --> 1:01:09.040
 but I have a certain set of things.

1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:12.080
 And I'm also, as I described,

1:01:12.080 --> 1:01:15.320
 sort of a nexus of a particular set of histories

1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:16.240
 that exist in the universe

1:01:16.240 --> 1:01:18.600
 and a particular set of futures that might exist.

1:01:18.600 --> 1:01:22.360
 And those futures that might exist are in part specified

1:01:22.360 --> 1:01:25.800
 by my physical configuration as me.

1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:29.500
 And therefore, it may not be free will

1:01:29.500 --> 1:01:30.720
 in the traditional sense.

1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:31.920
 I don't even know what people mean

1:01:31.920 --> 1:01:33.400
 when they're talking about free will, honestly.

1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:35.460
 It's like the whole discussion's really muddled.

1:01:35.460 --> 1:01:38.320
 But in the sense that I am a causal agent,

1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:40.720
 if you wanna call it that, that exists in the universe,

1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:42.160
 and there are certain things that happen

1:01:42.160 --> 1:01:45.600
 because I exist as me, then yes, I have free will.

1:01:45.600 --> 1:01:50.060
 No, but do you, Sarah, have a choice

1:01:50.060 --> 1:01:51.600
 about what's going to happen next?

1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:53.400
 Oh, I see.

1:01:53.400 --> 1:01:55.600
 If the universe, could I have,

1:01:55.600 --> 1:01:57.400
 if I run this universe. Yes, I think so.

1:01:57.400 --> 1:01:58.600
 You have a choice.

1:01:58.600 --> 1:02:00.240
 Where does the choice come from?

1:02:00.240 --> 1:02:02.280
 I think that's related to the physics of consciousness.

1:02:02.280 --> 1:02:03.960
 So one of the things I didn't say about that,

1:02:03.960 --> 1:02:06.800
 I don't know, maybe this is me just being hopeful

1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:08.640
 because maybe I just wanna have free will,

1:02:08.640 --> 1:02:10.800
 but I don't think that we can rule out the possibility

1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:13.020
 because I don't think that we understand enough

1:02:13.020 --> 1:02:14.440
 about any of these problems.

1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:16.400
 But I think one of the things that's interesting for me

1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:18.840
 about the sort of inversion of the question

1:02:18.840 --> 1:02:21.040
 of consciousness that I proposed

1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:24.080
 is one of the features that we do

1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:27.000
 is we have imagination, right?

1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:28.520
 And people don't think about imagination

1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:30.760
 as a physical thing, but it is a physical thing.

1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:32.480
 It exists in the universe, right?

1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:35.560
 And so I'm like really intrigued by the fact that say,

1:02:35.560 --> 1:02:38.720
 humans for, another physical system could do this too,

1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:39.760
 it's not special to humans,

1:02:39.760 --> 1:02:44.220
 but for centuries imagined flying machines and rockets,

1:02:44.220 --> 1:02:45.760
 and then we finally built them, right?

1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:47.640
 So they were represented in our minds

1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:50.040
 and on the pages of things that we drew

1:02:50.040 --> 1:02:51.840
 for hundreds of years before we could build

1:02:51.840 --> 1:02:54.040
 those physical objects in the universe.

1:02:54.040 --> 1:02:56.480
 But certainly the existence of rockets

1:02:56.480 --> 1:02:59.900
 is in part causally,

1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:03.640
 caused by the fact that we could imagine them.

1:03:03.640 --> 1:03:07.920
 And so there seems to be this property

1:03:07.920 --> 1:03:09.880
 that some things don't exist,

1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:12.080
 they've never physically existed in the universe,

1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:14.680
 but we can imagine the possibility of them existing

1:03:14.680 --> 1:03:16.520
 and then cause them to exist,

1:03:16.520 --> 1:03:18.480
 maybe individually or collectively.

1:03:18.480 --> 1:03:21.000
 And I think that property is related

1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.180
 to what I would say about having choice or free will,

1:03:23.180 --> 1:03:25.440
 because that set of possibilities,

1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:27.360
 those set of things that you can imagine

1:03:27.360 --> 1:03:29.720
 is not constrained to your local physical environment

1:03:29.720 --> 1:03:30.560
 and history.

1:03:30.560 --> 1:03:32.000
 And this is what's a little bit different

1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:34.440
 about intelligence as we see it in humans

1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:37.820
 and AI that we wanna build than biological intelligence,

1:03:37.820 --> 1:03:40.680
 because biological intelligence is predicated completely

1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:42.500
 on the history of things that's seen in the past,

1:03:42.500 --> 1:03:45.400
 but something happened with the neural architectures

1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:48.000
 that evolved in multicellular organisms

1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:50.400
 that they don't just have access to the past history

1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:52.400
 of their particular set of events,

1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:55.120
 but they can imagine things that haven't happened,

1:03:55.120 --> 1:03:56.180
 aren't on their timeline,

1:03:56.180 --> 1:03:58.080
 and as long as they're consistent with the laws of physics,

1:03:58.080 --> 1:03:59.560
 make them happen.

1:03:59.560 --> 1:04:02.360
 So this is fascinating.

1:04:02.360 --> 1:04:05.400
 It's trippy physics, but it exists, so there you go.

1:04:05.400 --> 1:04:06.400
 I mean, in some sense,

1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:10.040
 if you look at like general relativity and gravity

1:04:10.040 --> 1:04:12.800
 morphing space time in that same way,

1:04:12.800 --> 1:04:16.200
 maybe whatever the physics of consciousness might be,

1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:18.760
 it might be morphing, that's like what free will is.

1:04:18.760 --> 1:04:21.600
 It's morphing like the space,

1:04:21.600 --> 1:04:25.000
 just like ideas make rockets come to life.

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:30.000
 It's somehow changing the space of possible realizations

1:04:30.680 --> 1:04:33.520
 of like whatever's, yeah, okay, but that's.

1:04:33.520 --> 1:04:35.560
 Life is kind of basically, if you wanna think about it,

1:04:35.560 --> 1:04:38.480
 like life is sort of changing the probability distributions

1:04:38.480 --> 1:04:39.320
 over what can exist.

1:04:39.320 --> 1:04:40.960
 That's the physics of what life is.

1:04:40.960 --> 1:04:43.440
 And then consciousness is this sort of layered property

1:04:43.440 --> 1:04:45.160
 or imagination on top of it

1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:47.240
 that kind of scrambles that a little bit more

1:04:47.240 --> 1:04:50.320
 and like has access to, I don't know.

1:04:50.320 --> 1:04:53.040
 It's kind of, we don't know how to describe it, right?

1:04:53.040 --> 1:04:54.200
 Like that's why it's interesting, but.

1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:55.320
 But it's probabilistic.

1:04:55.320 --> 1:04:57.440
 So you do think like God plays dice.

1:04:57.440 --> 1:04:58.560
 So let me.

1:04:58.560 --> 1:05:00.520
 No, I think the description is probabilistic.

1:05:00.520 --> 1:05:02.320
 I don't necessarily think

1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:06.280
 the underlying physics is probabilistic.

1:05:06.280 --> 1:05:09.520
 I think the way that we can describe this physics

1:05:09.520 --> 1:05:12.240
 is going to be probabilistic and statistical,

1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:14.720
 but the under, like when we take measurements in the lab,

1:05:14.720 --> 1:05:15.960
 but the underlying physics itself

1:05:15.960 --> 1:05:17.080
 might still be deterministic.

1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:18.440
 I don't know.

1:05:18.440 --> 1:05:22.320
 Maybe I'm, it's hard to know what concepts to hold on to.

1:05:22.320 --> 1:05:24.760
 So I find myself constantly rejecting concepts,

1:05:24.760 --> 1:05:26.160
 but then I have to grab another one

1:05:26.160 --> 1:05:29.640
 and try to hold onto something from intellectual history.

1:05:29.640 --> 1:05:30.800
 Well, it's possible that our mind

1:05:30.800 --> 1:05:33.360
 is not able to hold the correct concepts in mind at all.

1:05:33.360 --> 1:05:36.080
 Like we're not able to even conceive of them correctly.

1:05:36.080 --> 1:05:39.000
 Maybe the word's deterministic or random

1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:42.360
 or not the right even words, concepts to be holding.

1:05:42.360 --> 1:05:46.600
 But maybe you can talk to the theory of everything,

1:05:46.600 --> 1:05:49.320
 this attempt in the current set of physical laws

1:05:49.320 --> 1:05:50.880
 to try to unify them.

1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:55.280
 Is there any hope that once a theory of everything

1:05:55.280 --> 1:05:56.840
 is developed, and by theory of everything,

1:05:56.840 --> 1:06:00.280
 I mean in a narrow sense of unifying quantum field theory

1:06:00.280 --> 1:06:01.520
 and general relativity,

1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:04.320
 do you think that will contain some,

1:06:05.960 --> 1:06:08.440
 like in order to do that unification,

1:06:08.440 --> 1:06:10.760
 you would have to get something

1:06:10.760 --> 1:06:13.280
 that would then give hints about the physics of life,

1:06:13.280 --> 1:06:15.880
 physics of existence, physics of consciousness.

1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:18.800
 Yeah, I used to not, but I actually,

1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:23.800
 I have become increasingly convinced that it probably will.

1:06:23.880 --> 1:06:25.960
 And part of the reason is,

1:06:25.960 --> 1:06:27.600
 I think I've talked a little bit already

1:06:27.600 --> 1:06:29.280
 about these holes in physics,

1:06:29.280 --> 1:06:32.840
 like the theories we have in physics,

1:06:32.840 --> 1:06:35.360
 they have problems, they have lots of problems

1:06:35.360 --> 1:06:37.120
 and they're very deep problems

1:06:37.120 --> 1:06:39.040
 and we don't know how to patch them.

1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:41.200
 And some of those problems become very evident

1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:43.440
 when you try to patch quantum mechanics

1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:45.680
 and general relativity together.

1:06:45.680 --> 1:06:47.520
 So there is this kind of interesting feature

1:06:47.520 --> 1:06:49.840
 that some of the ways of patching that

1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:54.200
 might actually closely resemble the physics of life.

1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:56.440
 And so the place where that actually comes up most,

1:06:56.440 --> 1:06:58.120
 and actually we just had a workshop

1:06:58.120 --> 1:06:59.040
 in the Beyond Center where I work

1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:00.600
 at Arizona State University,

1:07:00.600 --> 1:07:02.760
 and Lee Smolin made this point that he thinks

1:07:02.760 --> 1:07:05.080
 that the theory of quantum gravity when we solve it

1:07:05.080 --> 1:07:08.440
 is gonna be the same theory that gives rise to life.

1:07:08.440 --> 1:07:11.440
 And I think that I agree with him on some levels

1:07:11.440 --> 1:07:13.720
 because there's something very interesting where,

1:07:13.720 --> 1:07:17.280
 if you look at these sort of causal set theories of gravity

1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:21.840
 where they're looking for space as being emergent.

1:07:21.840 --> 1:07:24.640
 And so space time is an emergent concept from a causal set,

1:07:24.640 --> 1:07:26.440
 which is also sort of related, I think,

1:07:26.440 --> 1:07:29.200
 to what Wolfram's doing with his physics project.

1:07:29.200 --> 1:07:30.800
 It's the same kind of underlying math

1:07:30.800 --> 1:07:32.920
 that we have in this theory that we've been developing

1:07:32.920 --> 1:07:35.200
 related to life called assembly theory,

1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:39.800
 which is basically trying to look at complex objects

1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:44.160
 like molecules and bacteria and living things

1:07:44.160 --> 1:07:49.160
 as basically being assembled from a set of component parts

1:07:52.280 --> 1:07:54.640
 and that they actually encode all the possible histories

1:07:54.640 --> 1:07:56.640
 that they could have in that physical object.

1:07:56.640 --> 1:07:59.480
 So mathematically, all these ideas I think are related.

1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:00.680
 I think a lot of people are thinking about this

1:08:00.680 --> 1:08:02.280
 from different perspectives.

1:08:02.280 --> 1:08:04.440
 And then constructor theory that David Deutsch

1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:05.960
 and Chiara Marletto have been developing

1:08:05.960 --> 1:08:07.560
 is a totally different angle on it,

1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:09.120
 but I think getting at some similar ideas.

1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:11.200
 So it's a really interesting time right now, I think,

1:08:11.200 --> 1:08:13.680
 for the frontiers of physics and how it's relating

1:08:13.680 --> 1:08:15.920
 to maybe deeper principles about what life is.

1:08:15.920 --> 1:08:17.120
 So short answer, yes.

1:08:17.120 --> 1:08:19.200
 Long winded answer, rewind.

1:08:20.760 --> 1:08:22.760
 Can we talk about aliens?

1:08:22.760 --> 1:08:23.600
 Anytime.

1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:28.920
 So one, I think one interesting way to sneak up

1:08:28.920 --> 1:08:33.240
 on the question of what is life is to ask

1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:36.120
 what should we look for in alien life?

1:08:37.840 --> 1:08:42.440
 If we were to look out into our galaxy and into the universe

1:08:42.440 --> 1:08:47.440
 and come up with a framework of how to detect alien life,

1:08:47.440 --> 1:08:49.600
 what should we be looking for?

1:08:49.600 --> 1:08:54.600
 Is there like set of rules, like it's both the tools

1:08:55.400 --> 1:08:59.000
 and the tools that are service sensors

1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.640
 for certain kind of properties of life.

1:09:01.640 --> 1:09:05.400
 So what should we look for in alien life?

1:09:05.400 --> 1:09:08.000
 Yeah, so we have a paper actually coming out on Monday,

1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:09.600
 which is collaboration.

1:09:09.600 --> 1:09:11.640
 It's actually really Lee Cronin's lab,

1:09:11.640 --> 1:09:12.920
 but my group worked with him on it

1:09:12.920 --> 1:09:13.840
 and we're working on the theory,

1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:18.040
 which is this idea that we should look for life

1:09:18.040 --> 1:09:20.280
 as high assembly objects.

1:09:20.280 --> 1:09:22.120
 What we mean by that is,

1:09:22.120 --> 1:09:24.360
 which is actually observationally measurable.

1:09:24.360 --> 1:09:26.120
 And this is one of the reasons that I started working

1:09:26.120 --> 1:09:28.760
 with Lee on these ideas is because being a theorist,

1:09:28.760 --> 1:09:29.920
 it's easy to work in a vacuum.

1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:32.520
 It's very hard to connect abstract ideas

1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:34.120
 about the nature of life to anything

1:09:34.120 --> 1:09:35.720
 that's experimentally tractable.

1:09:36.800 --> 1:09:41.080
 But what his lab has been able to do is develop this method

1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:43.120
 where they look at a molecule

1:09:43.120 --> 1:09:46.160
 and they break it apart into all its component parts.

1:09:46.160 --> 1:09:47.040
 And so you say you used to have

1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:48.400
 some elementary building blocks

1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:51.160
 and you can build up all the ways of putting those together

1:09:51.160 --> 1:09:52.680
 to make the original object.

1:09:52.680 --> 1:09:55.240
 And then you look for the shortest path in that space.

1:09:55.240 --> 1:09:59.120
 And you say that's sort of the assembly number

1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:00.920
 associated to that object.

1:10:00.920 --> 1:10:02.880
 And if that number is higher,

1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:05.840
 it assumes that a longer causal history

1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:07.480
 is necessary to produce that object

1:10:07.480 --> 1:10:09.600
 or more information is necessary to specify

1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:11.440
 the creation of that object in the universe.

1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:14.160
 Now, that kind of idea at a superficial level

1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:15.800
 has existed for a long time.

1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:19.200
 That kind of idea as a physical observable of molecules

1:10:19.200 --> 1:10:20.800
 is completely novel.

1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:22.800
 And what his lab has been able to show

1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:24.520
 is that if you look at a bunch of samples

1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:26.800
 of nonbiological things and biological things,

1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:31.320
 there's this kind of threshold of assembly

1:10:31.320 --> 1:10:34.880
 where as far as the experimental evidence is

1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:38.040
 and also your intuitive intuition would suggest

1:10:38.040 --> 1:10:41.160
 that nonbiological systems don't produce things

1:10:41.160 --> 1:10:43.160
 with high assembly number.

1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:44.680
 So this goes back to the idea

1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:47.040
 like a protein is not gonna spontaneously fluctuate

1:10:47.040 --> 1:10:48.680
 into existence on the surface of Mars.

1:10:48.680 --> 1:10:50.120
 It requires an evolutionary process

1:10:50.120 --> 1:10:52.640
 and a biological architecture to produce a protein.

1:10:52.640 --> 1:10:54.480
 You generalize that argument,

1:10:54.480 --> 1:10:58.800
 a complex molecule or a cup or a desk ornament

1:10:58.800 --> 1:11:01.960
 in this sort of abstract idea of assembly spaces

1:11:01.960 --> 1:11:04.560
 as being the causal history of objects.

1:11:04.560 --> 1:11:06.240
 And you can talk about the shortest path

1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:08.440
 from elementary objects to an object

1:11:08.440 --> 1:11:10.960
 given an elementary set of operations.

1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:14.240
 And you can experimentally measure that with mass spec.

1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:16.640
 And that's basically the sort of the idea.

1:11:16.640 --> 1:11:17.640
 That's really fascinating.

1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:19.040
 I can't get out of my head.

1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:20.840
 I'd start imagining Legos

1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:23.320
 and all the Legos I've ever built and how many steps,

1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:28.320
 what is the shortest path to the final little Lego castles?

1:11:28.440 --> 1:11:31.800
 So then like asking about going to look for alien life,

1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:35.560
 the idea is most of the instruments that NASA builds,

1:11:35.560 --> 1:11:37.460
 for example, or any of the space agencies

1:11:37.460 --> 1:11:38.580
 looking for life in the universe

1:11:38.580 --> 1:11:41.980
 are looking for chemical correlates of life, right?

1:11:41.980 --> 1:11:43.360
 But here we have something

1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:46.280
 that is based on properties of molecules.

1:11:46.280 --> 1:11:49.120
 It's not a chemical correlate, it's agnostic.

1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:50.520
 It doesn't care about the molecule.

1:11:50.520 --> 1:11:53.760
 It cares about what is the history

1:11:53.760 --> 1:11:56.300
 necessary to produce this molecule?

1:11:56.300 --> 1:11:58.760
 How complex is it in terms of how much time is needing,

1:11:58.760 --> 1:12:00.840
 how much information is required to produce it?

1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:04.180
 So when you observe a thing on another planet,

1:12:04.180 --> 1:12:06.480
 you're essentially,

1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:08.520
 the process looks like a reverse engineering,

1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:10.480
 trying to figure out what is the shortest path

1:12:10.480 --> 1:12:11.600
 to create that thing.

1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:14.280
 Yeah, so most, yeah, and I would say most,

1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:16.680
 like most examples of biology or technology

1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:18.080
 don't take the shortest path, right?

1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:20.120
 But the shortest path is a bound on how hard it is

1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:21.640
 for the universe to make that.

1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:25.080
 Yeah, and I guess what you and Lee are saying

1:12:25.080 --> 1:12:26.560
 that there's a heuristic,

1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:30.280
 that's a good metric for like better perhaps

1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:31.600
 than chemical correlates.

1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:34.640
 Yes, because it doesn't, it's not contingent

1:12:34.640 --> 1:12:37.480
 on looking for the chemistry of life on earth,

1:12:37.480 --> 1:12:38.960
 on other planets.

1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:42.040
 And it also has a deeper explanatory framework

1:12:42.040 --> 1:12:43.360
 associated to it,

1:12:43.360 --> 1:12:45.720
 as far as the kind of theory that we're trying to develop

1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:47.320
 associated to what life is.

1:12:47.320 --> 1:12:48.940
 And I think this is one of the problems I have

1:12:48.940 --> 1:12:51.680
 in my field personally in astrobiology

1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:53.960
 is people observe something on earth,

1:12:53.960 --> 1:12:58.520
 say oxygen in the atmosphere or an amino acid in a cell,

1:12:58.520 --> 1:13:02.280
 and then they say, let's go look for that on another planet.

1:13:02.280 --> 1:13:04.080
 Let's look for oxygen on exoplanets

1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:06.360
 or let's look for amino acids on Mars.

1:13:06.360 --> 1:13:09.080
 And then they assume that's a way of looking for life

1:13:12.140 --> 1:13:13.560
 or even phosphine on Venus.

1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:15.240
 But you know, like there's all these examples

1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:17.240
 of let's look for one molecule.

1:13:17.240 --> 1:13:18.440
 A molecule is not life.

1:13:18.440 --> 1:13:21.840
 Life is a system that patterns particular structures

1:13:21.840 --> 1:13:22.680
 into matter.

1:13:22.680 --> 1:13:24.460
 That's like, that's what it is.

1:13:24.460 --> 1:13:26.760
 And it doesn't care what molecules are there.

1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:29.160
 It's something about the patterns and that structure

1:13:29.160 --> 1:13:30.160
 and that history.

1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:33.220
 And if you're looking for a molecule,

1:13:33.220 --> 1:13:34.680
 you're not testing any hypotheses

1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:36.160
 about the nature of what life is.

1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:37.440
 It doesn't tell me anything.

1:13:37.440 --> 1:13:39.000
 If we discover oxygen on an exoplanet

1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:40.200
 about what kind of life is there,

1:13:40.200 --> 1:13:42.040
 just oxygen on an exoplanet.

1:13:42.040 --> 1:13:45.480
 It's not, there's, I guess I think like,

1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:46.640
 when you think about the question,

1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:47.800
 are we alone in the universe?

1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:49.520
 That's a pretty fricking deep question.

1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:51.040
 It should have a fricking deep answer.

1:13:51.040 --> 1:13:53.000
 It shouldn't just be, there's a molecule on an exoplanet.

1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:54.520
 Wow, we solved the problem.

1:13:54.520 --> 1:13:56.560
 It should tell us something meaningful about our existence.

1:13:56.560 --> 1:13:59.000
 And I feel like we've fallen short

1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.200
 on how we're searching for life

1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:05.260
 in terms of actually searching for things like us

1:14:05.260 --> 1:14:06.960
 in this kind of deeper way.

1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:10.360
 But how do you do that initial kind of,

1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:12.060
 say I'm walking down the street

1:14:12.060 --> 1:14:15.520
 and I'm looking for that double take test of like,

1:14:15.520 --> 1:14:17.180
 like what the hell is that?

1:14:17.180 --> 1:14:22.180
 Like that initial, like how do we look for

1:14:22.220 --> 1:14:24.160
 the possibility of weirdness

1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:26.480
 or the possibility of high assembly number?

1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:27.320
 Well, yeah.

1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:29.680
 Like what would aliens look like

1:14:29.680 --> 1:14:32.760
 if they don't have two eyes and are green?

1:14:32.760 --> 1:14:35.520
 If I knew, I wouldn't probably already solve the problem.

1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:37.640
 Right, there's another Nobel Prize in there somewhere.

1:14:37.640 --> 1:14:39.880
 Yeah, somewhere in there.

1:14:39.880 --> 1:14:41.280
 Well, I think it's kind of,

1:14:41.280 --> 1:14:43.160
 so there is a bias here, right?

1:14:43.160 --> 1:14:45.920
 So we've evolved to recognize life on earth, right?

1:14:45.920 --> 1:14:48.600
 Like I, you know, children at a very early age

1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:50.640
 can tell the difference between a puppy and a plant

1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:53.400
 and then the plant and a chair, for example.

1:14:53.400 --> 1:14:55.720
 You know, like it just, it seems innate.

1:14:55.720 --> 1:14:58.540
 And so I think, and also because we're life,

1:14:59.920 --> 1:15:02.560
 you know, I think like there's this implicit bias

1:15:02.560 --> 1:15:03.880
 that we should know it when we see it

1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:06.780
 and it should be completely obvious to us.

1:15:06.780 --> 1:15:08.940
 But there are a lot of features of our universe

1:15:08.940 --> 1:15:10.380
 that are not completely obvious to us.

1:15:10.380 --> 1:15:12.380
 Like the fact that this table is made of atoms

1:15:12.380 --> 1:15:13.720
 and that I'm sitting

1:15:13.720 --> 1:15:16.080
 in a gravitational potential well right now.

1:15:16.080 --> 1:15:19.440
 And I guess my point with this is,

1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:23.240
 I think life is much less obvious than we think it is.

1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:25.280
 And so it could be in many more forms

1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:27.080
 than we think it is.

1:15:27.080 --> 1:15:28.720
 And I guess this goes back to the point

1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:30.000
 about being open minded

1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:33.000
 that we may not know what alien life looks like.

1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.480
 It might not even be possible to interact with alien life

1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:38.520
 because maybe something about, you know,

1:15:38.520 --> 1:15:41.240
 our informational lineage, it makes it impossible

1:15:41.240 --> 1:15:43.880
 for information from an alien to be copied to us.

1:15:43.880 --> 1:15:46.040
 Therefore there's no, you know,

1:15:46.040 --> 1:15:47.800
 so to speak communication channel.

1:15:47.800 --> 1:15:49.840
 And I don't mean, you know, verbal communication,

1:15:49.840 --> 1:15:52.960
 just it's not in our observational space.

1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:56.240
 Like, you know, there's fundamental questions

1:15:56.240 --> 1:15:58.120
 about why we observe the universe in position

1:15:58.120 --> 1:16:00.800
 rather than momentum, but we also, you know,

1:16:00.800 --> 1:16:03.120
 observe it in terms of certain informational patterns

1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:04.980
 and things like that's what our brain constructs

1:16:04.980 --> 1:16:07.280
 and maybe aliens just interact

1:16:07.280 --> 1:16:08.640
 with a different part of reality than we do.

1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:11.040
 That's wildly speculative, but I think, I think.

1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:12.840
 But it's possible.

1:16:12.840 --> 1:16:15.140
 It's possible and I think it's consistent with the physics.

1:16:15.140 --> 1:16:17.160
 So I think the best ways we can ask questions

1:16:17.160 --> 1:16:19.600
 are about life and chemistry

1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:20.880
 and asking questions about

1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:23.360
 if information is a real physical thing,

1:16:23.360 --> 1:16:25.600
 what would its signatures be in matter

1:16:26.900 --> 1:16:28.960
 and how do we recognize those?

1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:31.540
 And I think the ones that are most obvious

1:16:31.540 --> 1:16:33.080
 are the ones I've already articulated.

1:16:33.080 --> 1:16:35.680
 You have these objects that seem completely improbable

1:16:35.680 --> 1:16:36.900
 for the universe to produce

1:16:36.900 --> 1:16:39.120
 because the universe doesn't have the design

1:16:39.120 --> 1:16:40.960
 of that object in the laws.

1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:44.500
 So therefore an object had to evolve.

1:16:44.500 --> 1:16:46.720
 We talk, we call it evolution,

1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:48.480
 but it had to be produced by the universe

1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:51.360
 that then had all of the possible tasks

1:16:51.360 --> 1:16:54.680
 to make that object specified.

1:16:54.680 --> 1:16:55.520
 I mean, there's some,

1:16:55.520 --> 1:16:59.120
 like there's an engineering question here of,

1:16:59.120 --> 1:17:02.080
 are there sensors we can create that can give us,

1:17:03.400 --> 1:17:05.720
 can help us discover certain pockets

1:17:05.720 --> 1:17:08.440
 of high assemblies aliens?

1:17:08.440 --> 1:17:10.880
 Like, I mean, there is a hope

1:17:12.120 --> 1:17:14.640
 setting dogs and chairs aside,

1:17:14.640 --> 1:17:19.480
 there's a hope that visually we could detect,

1:17:19.480 --> 1:17:22.880
 like, because our universe,

1:17:22.880 --> 1:17:24.480
 I mean, at least the way we look at it now,

1:17:24.480 --> 1:17:27.240
 like this three dimensional like space time,

1:17:27.240 --> 1:17:29.360
 we can visually comprehend it.

1:17:29.360 --> 1:17:31.280
 It's interesting to think like,

1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:33.040
 if we got to hang out,

1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:34.840
 if there's an alien in this room,

1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:39.360
 like would we be able to detect it with our current sensors?

1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:41.960
 Not the fancy kinds, but like web cam.

1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:43.320
 Like say standing over there.

1:17:43.320 --> 1:17:44.440
 Yeah, standing over there

1:17:44.440 --> 1:17:45.880
 or maybe like in this carpet,

1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:48.200
 see there's all these kinds of patterns, right?

1:17:48.200 --> 1:17:52.880
 I don't know if this carpet is an alien.

1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:55.160
 Well, so I see what you're saying.

1:17:56.200 --> 1:17:57.800
 So assembly theory is pretty general.

1:17:57.800 --> 1:18:00.040
 Like, I mean, we've been applying it to molecules

1:18:00.040 --> 1:18:02.160
 because it makes sense to apply it to molecules,

1:18:02.160 --> 1:18:05.080
 but it's supposed to explain life,

1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:07.200
 like the physics of life.

1:18:07.200 --> 1:18:09.280
 So it should explain the things in this room

1:18:09.280 --> 1:18:11.280
 in addition to molecules.

1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:14.640
 So I guess, and you can apply it to images and things.

1:18:14.640 --> 1:18:18.600
 So I guess the idea you could explore

1:18:18.600 --> 1:18:21.280
 is just looking at everything on planet earth

1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:23.200
 in terms of its assembly structure

1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:24.960
 and then looking for things

1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:27.080
 that aren't part of our biological lineage.

1:18:27.080 --> 1:18:29.440
 If they have high assembly, they might be aliens on earth.

1:18:29.440 --> 1:18:31.320
 I mean, that is a very kind of rigorous

1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:32.320
 computer vision question.

1:18:32.320 --> 1:18:36.640
 Can we visually, is there a strong correlation

1:18:36.640 --> 1:18:38.600
 between certain kind of high assembly objects

1:18:38.600 --> 1:18:39.880
 when they get to the scale

1:18:39.880 --> 1:18:42.080
 where they're visually observable

1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:47.080
 and some, like when it's say projected onto a 2D plane,

1:18:47.240 --> 1:18:49.720
 can we figure out something?

1:18:49.720 --> 1:18:51.480
 I'm glad you brought up the computer vision point

1:18:51.480 --> 1:18:53.560
 because for a while I had this kind of thought in my mind

1:18:53.560 --> 1:18:55.200
 that we can't even see ourselves clearly.

1:18:55.200 --> 1:18:56.520
 So one of the things,

1:18:56.520 --> 1:18:57.960
 people are worried about artificial intelligence

1:18:57.960 --> 1:18:58.800
 for a lot of reasons,

1:18:58.800 --> 1:18:59.880
 but I think it's really fascinating

1:18:59.880 --> 1:19:03.320
 because it's like the first time in history

1:19:03.320 --> 1:19:04.440
 that we're building a system

1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:06.360
 that can help us understand ourselves.

1:19:06.360 --> 1:19:08.560
 So like, people talk about AI physics,

1:19:08.560 --> 1:19:12.520
 but like, when I look at another person,

1:19:12.520 --> 1:19:15.400
 I don't see them as a 4 billion year lineage,

1:19:15.400 --> 1:19:16.360
 but that's what they are.

1:19:16.360 --> 1:19:18.160
 And so is everything here, right?

1:19:18.160 --> 1:19:21.440
 So imagine that we built artificial systems

1:19:21.440 --> 1:19:24.280
 that could actually see that feature of us,

1:19:24.280 --> 1:19:25.640
 what else would they see?

1:19:26.600 --> 1:19:28.680
 And I think that's what you're asking.

1:19:28.680 --> 1:19:31.840
 And I think that would be so cool.

1:19:31.840 --> 1:19:35.360
 I want that to happen,

1:19:35.360 --> 1:19:38.600
 but I think we're a little ways off from it, but yeah.

1:19:38.600 --> 1:19:40.200
 We're going there, I hope.

1:19:40.200 --> 1:19:43.400
 Okay, let me ask you, I apologize ahead of time,

1:19:43.400 --> 1:19:45.160
 but let me ask you the internet question.

1:19:45.160 --> 1:19:46.200
 So you're a physicist,

1:19:46.200 --> 1:19:49.640
 you ask rigorous questions about the physics of existence

1:19:49.640 --> 1:19:52.840
 and these models of high assembly objects.

1:19:52.840 --> 1:19:55.160
 Now, when the internet would see an alien,

1:19:55.160 --> 1:19:56.440
 they would ask two questions.

1:19:56.440 --> 1:19:58.080
 One, can I eat it?

1:19:58.080 --> 1:19:59.960
 And two, can I have sex with it?

1:19:59.960 --> 1:20:00.800
 Yes.

1:20:00.800 --> 1:20:02.440
 So, the internet is.

1:20:02.440 --> 1:20:04.560
 All the existential questions,

1:20:04.560 --> 1:20:05.400
 those are very important ones.

1:20:05.400 --> 1:20:07.400
 The internet is very sophisticated.

1:20:07.400 --> 1:20:10.600
 It really is, it's gotten our basal cognition pretty good.

1:20:10.600 --> 1:20:12.600
 So you kind of mentioned that it's very difficult.

1:20:12.600 --> 1:20:14.360
 It's possible that we may not be

1:20:14.360 --> 1:20:16.080
 even able to communicate with it.

1:20:16.080 --> 1:20:18.560
 Right, I think the internet has more hope than we do.

1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:21.040
 Yeah, it's a hopeful place, yes.

1:20:21.040 --> 1:20:23.680
 Do you think in terms of interacting

1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:27.720
 on this very primal level of sharing resources,

1:20:27.720 --> 1:20:28.880
 like what would aliens eat?

1:20:28.880 --> 1:20:29.880
 What would we eat?

1:20:29.880 --> 1:20:31.400
 Would we eat the same thing?

1:20:31.400 --> 1:20:33.880
 Could we potentially eat each other?

1:20:33.880 --> 1:20:37.240
 One person eats the other, or the aliens eat us.

1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:39.960
 And the same thing with not sex in general,

1:20:39.960 --> 1:20:42.360
 or reproduction, but genetically mixing stuff.

1:20:42.360 --> 1:20:46.560
 Like, would we be able to mix genetic information?

1:20:46.560 --> 1:20:48.760
 Maybe not genetic, but maybe information, right?

1:20:48.760 --> 1:20:50.520
 And I think part of your question is like,

1:20:50.520 --> 1:20:54.200
 so if you think of life as like this history

1:20:54.200 --> 1:20:55.600
 of events that happen in the universe,

1:20:55.600 --> 1:20:56.960
 like there's this question of like,

1:20:56.960 --> 1:20:59.320
 how divergent are those histories, right?

1:20:59.320 --> 1:21:00.920
 So when we get to the scale of technology,

1:21:00.920 --> 1:21:02.920
 it's possible to imagine,

1:21:02.920 --> 1:21:04.080
 although we can't even do it.

1:21:04.080 --> 1:21:05.720
 Like imagine all the possible technologies

1:21:05.720 --> 1:21:06.840
 that could exist in the universe.

1:21:06.840 --> 1:21:08.600
 But if you think about all the possible chemistries,

1:21:08.600 --> 1:21:10.840
 somehow that seems like a lower dimensional space

1:21:10.840 --> 1:21:12.720
 and a lower set of possibilities.

1:21:12.720 --> 1:21:15.840
 So it might be that like when we interact with aliens,

1:21:15.840 --> 1:21:19.080
 we do have to go back to those more basal levels

1:21:19.080 --> 1:21:22.680
 to figure out sort of what the map is, right?

1:21:22.680 --> 1:21:25.640
 Like the sort of where we have a common history.

1:21:25.640 --> 1:21:28.800
 We must have a common history somewhere in the universe,

1:21:28.800 --> 1:21:31.360
 but in order to be able to actually interact

1:21:31.360 --> 1:21:33.560
 in a meaningful way, you have to have some shared history.

1:21:33.560 --> 1:21:35.560
 I mean, the reason we can exchange genetic information

1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:39.080
 in each other's food or eat each other as food

1:21:39.080 --> 1:21:40.720
 is because we have a shared history.

1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:42.680
 So we have to find that shared history.

1:21:42.680 --> 1:21:44.240
 We have to find the common ancestor

1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:47.160
 in this causality map, the causality tree.

1:21:47.160 --> 1:21:49.600
 Yes, and we have a last universal common ancestor

1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:51.840
 for all life on earth, which I think is sort of the nexus

1:21:51.840 --> 1:21:54.080
 of that causality map for life on earth.

1:21:54.080 --> 1:21:56.880
 But the question is where would other aliens

1:21:56.880 --> 1:21:58.200
 diverge on that map?

1:21:58.200 --> 1:21:59.040
 That's really interesting.

1:21:59.040 --> 1:22:03.600
 And I mean, so say there's a lot of aliens out there

1:22:03.600 --> 1:22:07.000
 in the universe, each set of organisms

1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:08.800
 will probably have like a number, you know,

1:22:08.800 --> 1:22:13.120
 like Erdos number of like how far,

1:22:13.120 --> 1:22:15.960
 like how far our common ancestor is.

1:22:15.960 --> 1:22:19.600
 And so the closer the common ancestor, like it is on earth,

1:22:19.600 --> 1:22:22.280
 the more likely we are to be able

1:22:22.280 --> 1:22:24.120
 to have sexual reproduction.

1:22:24.120 --> 1:22:26.080
 Well, it's like sort of like humans having common culture

1:22:26.080 --> 1:22:27.120
 and languages, right?

1:22:27.120 --> 1:22:27.960
 Yeah, exactly.

1:22:27.960 --> 1:22:32.360
 Yeah, it might take a lot of work though with an alien

1:22:32.360 --> 1:22:35.600
 cause you really have to get over a language barrier.

1:22:35.600 --> 1:22:36.640
 Oh boy.

1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:40.080
 So it's communication, it's resources.

1:22:40.080 --> 1:22:41.640
 I mean, it's all the whole,

1:22:43.480 --> 1:22:46.320
 and I think tied into that is the questions

1:22:46.320 --> 1:22:48.160
 of like who's going to harm who.

1:22:48.160 --> 1:22:49.000
 Right.

1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:49.840
 And actually definitions of harm.

1:22:49.840 --> 1:22:50.920
 And whether your parents approve,

1:22:50.920 --> 1:22:52.800
 you know, all those kind of questions.

1:22:52.800 --> 1:22:54.600
 Whether the common ancestor approves.

1:22:54.600 --> 1:22:58.040
 Yeah, that's just very true.

1:22:58.040 --> 1:23:00.880
 How many alien civilizations do you think are out there?

1:23:01.760 --> 1:23:03.920
 I don't have intuition for that,

1:23:04.960 --> 1:23:07.440
 which I have always thought was deeply intriguing.

1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:11.440
 So, and part of this, I mean, I say it specifically

1:23:11.440 --> 1:23:12.720
 as I don't have intuition for that

1:23:12.720 --> 1:23:14.160
 because it's like one of those questions

1:23:14.160 --> 1:23:15.480
 that you feel around for a while

1:23:15.480 --> 1:23:19.360
 and you really just, you can't see it

1:23:19.360 --> 1:23:20.880
 even though it might be right there.

1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:24.200
 And in that sense, it's a little like

1:23:24.200 --> 1:23:25.840
 the quantum to classical can transition.

1:23:25.840 --> 1:23:26.760
 You're like really talking about

1:23:26.760 --> 1:23:28.000
 two different kinds of physics.

1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:29.360
 And I think that's kind of part of the problem.

1:23:29.360 --> 1:23:30.400
 Once we understand the physics,

1:23:30.400 --> 1:23:33.040
 that question might become more meaningful.

1:23:33.040 --> 1:23:34.760
 But there's also this other issue,

1:23:36.320 --> 1:23:37.720
 and this was really instilled on me

1:23:37.720 --> 1:23:39.720
 by my mentor, Paul Davies, when I was a postdoc,

1:23:39.720 --> 1:23:42.240
 because he always talks about how, you know,

1:23:42.240 --> 1:23:45.800
 whether aliens are common or rare is kind of just,

1:23:45.800 --> 1:23:49.200
 you know, it like, you know, it follows a wave of popularity

1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:51.320
 and it just depends on like the mood of, you know,

1:23:51.320 --> 1:23:53.160
 what the culture is at the time.

1:23:53.160 --> 1:23:54.480
 And I always thought that was kind of

1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:56.880
 an intriguing observation, but also there's this,

1:23:56.880 --> 1:23:58.360
 you know, set of points about

1:23:58.360 --> 1:23:59.920
 if you go by the observational evidence,

1:23:59.920 --> 1:24:02.200
 which we're supposed to do as scientists, right?

1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:08.600
 You know, we have evidence of us

1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:11.560
 and one origin of life event from which we emerged.

1:24:11.560 --> 1:24:13.080
 And people wanna make arguments

1:24:13.080 --> 1:24:15.720
 that because that event was rapid

1:24:15.720 --> 1:24:17.240
 or because there's other planets

1:24:17.240 --> 1:24:18.720
 that have properties similar to ours,

1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:20.400
 that that event should be common.

1:24:20.400 --> 1:24:22.040
 But you actually can't reason on that

1:24:22.040 --> 1:24:23.720
 because our existence observing that event

1:24:23.720 --> 1:24:25.720
 is contingent on that event happening,

1:24:25.720 --> 1:24:27.800
 which means it could have been completely improbable

1:24:27.800 --> 1:24:29.360
 or very common.

1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:31.800
 And Brandon Carter, like clearly articulated that

1:24:31.800 --> 1:24:35.400
 in terms of anthropic arguments a few decades ago.

1:24:35.400 --> 1:24:37.960
 So there is this kind of issue

1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:39.800
 that we have to contend with dealing with life

1:24:39.800 --> 1:24:41.880
 that's closer to home than we have to deal with

1:24:41.880 --> 1:24:43.600
 with any other problems in physics,

1:24:43.600 --> 1:24:45.800
 which we're talking about the physics of ourselves.

1:24:45.800 --> 1:24:47.640
 And when you're asking about the origin of life event,

1:24:47.640 --> 1:24:48.960
 that event happening in the universe,

1:24:48.960 --> 1:24:52.520
 at least as like our existence is contingent on it.

1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:55.800
 And so you can think about sort of fine tuning arguments

1:24:55.800 --> 1:24:56.640
 that way too.

1:24:56.640 --> 1:25:00.000
 So, but the sort of otter part of it is like,

1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:03.200
 when I think about how likely it is,

1:25:03.200 --> 1:25:06.320
 I think it's because we don't understand this mechanism yet

1:25:06.320 --> 1:25:10.800
 about how information can be generated spontaneously

1:25:10.800 --> 1:25:13.800
 that I like, cause I can't see that physics clearly yet,

1:25:13.800 --> 1:25:15.720
 even though I have a lot of, you know,

1:25:15.720 --> 1:25:18.680
 like some things around the space of it in my mind,

1:25:18.680 --> 1:25:22.480
 I can't articulate how likely that process is.

1:25:22.480 --> 1:25:24.200
 So my honest answer is, I don't know.

1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:25.920
 And sometimes that feels like a cop out,

1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:27.400
 but I feel like that's a more honest answer

1:25:27.400 --> 1:25:29.800
 and a more meaningful way of making progress

1:25:29.800 --> 1:25:32.760
 than what a lot of people wanna do, which is say,

1:25:32.760 --> 1:25:34.760
 oh, well, we have a one in 10 chance of having

1:25:34.760 --> 1:25:36.480
 on an exoplanet with Earth like properties

1:25:36.480 --> 1:25:38.760
 because there's lots of Earth like planets out there

1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:40.360
 and life happened fast on Earth.

1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:42.960
 Well, so I have kind of a follow up question,

1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:46.640
 but as a side comment, what I really am enjoying

1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:48.800
 about the way you're talking about human beings

1:25:48.800 --> 1:25:51.240
 is you always say, and not to make yourself conscious

1:25:51.240 --> 1:25:53.080
 about it, cause I really, really enjoy it.

1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:57.360
 You say we, you don't say humans.

1:25:57.360 --> 1:26:00.200
 You say, cause oftentimes like, you know,

1:26:00.200 --> 1:26:01.760
 I don't know, evolutionary biologists

1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:05.400
 will kind of put yourself out as an observer,

1:26:05.400 --> 1:26:09.040
 but it's kind of fascinating to think that you as a human

1:26:09.040 --> 1:26:11.080
 are struggling about your own origins.

1:26:11.080 --> 1:26:12.720
 Yes, that's the problem.

1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:17.160
 And yeah, and I think, I don't do that deliberately,

1:26:17.160 --> 1:26:18.440
 but I do think that way.

1:26:18.440 --> 1:26:19.760
 And this is sort of the inversion

1:26:19.760 --> 1:26:21.600
 from the logic of physics because physics

1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:24.280
 as it's always been constructed has treated us

1:26:24.280 --> 1:26:26.360
 as external observers of the universe.

1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:27.680
 And we are not part of the universe.

1:26:27.680 --> 1:26:29.360
 And this is why the problem of life,

1:26:29.360 --> 1:26:31.320
 I think demands completely new thinking

1:26:31.320 --> 1:26:33.600
 because we have to think about ourselves

1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:35.600
 as minds that exist in the universe

1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:37.800
 and are at this particular moment in history

1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:39.680
 and looking out at the things around us

1:26:39.680 --> 1:26:42.720
 and trying to understand what we are inside the system,

1:26:42.720 --> 1:26:43.840
 not outside the system.

1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:46.800
 We don't have descriptions at a fundamental level

1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:48.840
 that describe us as inside the system.

1:26:48.840 --> 1:26:51.280
 And this was my problem with cellular automata also.

1:26:51.280 --> 1:26:54.200
 You're always an external observer for a cellular automata.

1:26:54.200 --> 1:26:55.280
 You're not in the system.

1:26:55.280 --> 1:26:58.000
 What does the cellular automata look like from the inside?

1:26:58.920 --> 1:27:00.880
 I think you just broke my brain with that question.

1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:01.720
 Exactly.

1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:02.560
 But that's the fundamental.

1:27:02.560 --> 1:27:03.400
 I thought about that for a long time, but.

1:27:03.400 --> 1:27:08.400
 I'm gonna, yeah, that's a really clean formulation

1:27:08.400 --> 1:27:10.640
 of a very fundamental question,

1:27:10.640 --> 1:27:13.640
 because you can only, to understand cellular automata,

1:27:13.640 --> 1:27:15.040
 you have to be inside of it.

1:27:16.560 --> 1:27:20.880
 But as a human, sort of a poetic, romantic question,

1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:22.120
 does it make you sad?

1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:27.120
 Does it make you hopeful whether we're alone or not?

1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:31.040
 Like in the different possible versions of that,

1:27:31.040 --> 1:27:36.040
 if we're the highest assembly object in the entire universe,

1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:37.000
 does that give you?

1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:38.120
 At this moment in time, maybe.

1:27:38.120 --> 1:27:39.880
 At this moment in the causal.

1:27:39.880 --> 1:27:41.880
 Cause we may, I assume we have a future.

1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:43.520
 Well, we definitely have a future.

1:27:43.520 --> 1:27:47.920
 The question is where that future decreases the assembly.

1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:52.040
 Like it could be where at the peak, or we could be just.

1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:55.800
 That would be inconsistent with the physics in my mind.

1:27:55.800 --> 1:27:59.160
 But so I should give a caveat.

1:27:59.160 --> 1:28:01.560
 I've given the caveat that I'm biased as a physicist,

1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:03.560
 but I'm also biased as an eternal optimist.

1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:06.560
 So pretty much all of my modes of operation

1:28:06.560 --> 1:28:08.120
 for building theories about the world

1:28:08.120 --> 1:28:10.160
 are not like an Occam's razor,

1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:11.640
 what's the simplest explanation,

1:28:11.640 --> 1:28:14.440
 but what's the most optimistic explanation.

1:28:14.440 --> 1:28:16.240
 And part of the reason for that

1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:20.720
 is if you really think explanations have causal power,

1:28:20.720 --> 1:28:22.080
 in the sense that our,

1:28:22.080 --> 1:28:23.720
 like the fact that we have theories about the world

1:28:23.720 --> 1:28:24.960
 has enabled technologies

1:28:24.960 --> 1:28:27.560
 and physically transform the world around us.

1:28:27.560 --> 1:28:29.120
 I think I have to take seriously that

1:28:29.120 --> 1:28:31.400
 as a part of the physics I wanna describe

1:28:31.400 --> 1:28:35.880
 and try to build theories of reality

1:28:35.880 --> 1:28:37.800
 that are optimistic about what's coming next

1:28:37.800 --> 1:28:39.080
 because the theories are in part

1:28:39.080 --> 1:28:40.560
 the causes of what comes next.

1:28:42.320 --> 1:28:45.000
 So there could be a physics of hope

1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:46.880
 or physics of optimism in there too.

1:28:46.880 --> 1:28:48.000
 Yes.

1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:50.800
 Is that seems like also,

1:28:50.800 --> 1:28:53.920
 I mean, optimism does seem to be a kind of engine

1:28:53.920 --> 1:28:56.200
 that results in innovation.

1:28:56.200 --> 1:28:57.040
 Yes.

1:28:57.040 --> 1:28:58.320
 So this is like,

1:28:58.320 --> 1:29:02.040
 why the hell are we trying to come up with new stuff?

1:29:02.040 --> 1:29:04.840
 Oh, so I made this point about thinking life

1:29:04.840 --> 1:29:06.120
 is the physics of existence.

1:29:06.120 --> 1:29:07.800
 And it's not just the physics of existence,

1:29:07.800 --> 1:29:11.360
 it's the physics of more things existing.

1:29:11.360 --> 1:29:12.800
 So I think one of these drives of like.

1:29:12.800 --> 1:29:13.640
 Creativity.

1:29:13.640 --> 1:29:16.320
 Yeah, creativity, like optimism.

1:29:16.320 --> 1:29:18.640
 So if you like, people like entropy.

1:29:18.640 --> 1:29:21.360
 I don't like entropy as it was formulated in the 1800s.

1:29:21.360 --> 1:29:22.760
 I think it's an antiquated concept,

1:29:22.760 --> 1:29:26.320
 but this idea of maximizing

1:29:26.320 --> 1:29:28.880
 over the possible number of states that could exist.

1:29:28.880 --> 1:29:31.080
 Imagine the universe is actually trying to maximize

1:29:31.080 --> 1:29:33.360
 over the number of things that could physically exist.

1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:34.680
 What would be the best way to do that?

1:29:34.680 --> 1:29:35.520
 The best way to do that

1:29:35.520 --> 1:29:37.760
 would be evolve intelligent technological things

1:29:37.760 --> 1:29:39.320
 that could explore that space.

1:29:41.760 --> 1:29:43.840
 So, okay, that's talking about alien life

1:29:43.840 --> 1:29:45.080
 out there in the universe,

1:29:45.080 --> 1:29:48.560
 but you've also earlier in the conversation mentioned

1:29:48.560 --> 1:29:50.200
 the shadow biosphere.

1:29:50.200 --> 1:29:55.200
 So is it possible that we have weird life here on earth

1:29:56.320 --> 1:29:58.440
 that we're just not,

1:29:58.440 --> 1:30:02.200
 like even in a high assembly formulation of life,

1:30:02.200 --> 1:30:05.680
 that we're just not paying attention to?

1:30:05.680 --> 1:30:07.040
 We're blind to.

1:30:07.040 --> 1:30:09.480
 Like life we're potentially able to detect,

1:30:09.480 --> 1:30:10.520
 but we're blind to.

1:30:10.520 --> 1:30:12.320
 And maybe you could say, what is the shadow biosphere?

1:30:12.320 --> 1:30:13.320
 Sure, sure.

1:30:13.320 --> 1:30:15.160
 Yeah, the shadow biosphere is this idea

1:30:15.160 --> 1:30:17.960
 that there might've been other original life events

1:30:17.960 --> 1:30:21.000
 that happened on earth that were independent

1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:24.040
 from the original life event that led to us

1:30:24.040 --> 1:30:26.360
 and all of the life that we know on earth.

1:30:26.360 --> 1:30:29.360
 And therefore there could be aliens

1:30:29.360 --> 1:30:32.120
 in the sense they have a different origin event.

1:30:32.120 --> 1:30:33.280
 Living among us.

1:30:34.600 --> 1:30:37.120
 And it was proposed by a number of people,

1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:39.920
 but one of them was Paul Davies

1:30:39.920 --> 1:30:41.160
 that I mentioned earlier is my mentor.

1:30:41.160 --> 1:30:42.960
 And he has a really cute way of saying

1:30:42.960 --> 1:30:44.760
 that aliens could be right under our noses

1:30:44.760 --> 1:30:46.080
 or even in our noses.

1:30:48.680 --> 1:30:50.360
 With a British accent, it sounds better.

1:30:50.360 --> 1:30:53.760
 But anyway, so the idea is like,

1:30:53.760 --> 1:30:56.440
 it could literally be anywhere around us.

1:30:56.440 --> 1:30:58.240
 And if you think actually about the discovery

1:30:58.240 --> 1:31:00.240
 of like viruses and bacteria,

1:31:00.240 --> 1:31:02.400
 for a long time they were kind of a shadow biosphere.

1:31:02.400 --> 1:31:06.080
 It was life that was around us, but invisible.

1:31:08.240 --> 1:31:09.800
 But this takes it a little bit further

1:31:09.800 --> 1:31:12.000
 and saying that all of those examples,

1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:14.960
 viruses, bacteria and everything that we've discovered so far

1:31:14.960 --> 1:31:16.160
 has this common ancestry

1:31:16.160 --> 1:31:18.520
 and the last universal common ancestor of life on earth.

1:31:18.520 --> 1:31:20.440
 So maybe there was a different origin event

1:31:20.440 --> 1:31:24.480
 and that life is weirder still and might be among us

1:31:24.480 --> 1:31:25.600
 and we could find it.

1:31:26.680 --> 1:31:28.520
 We don't have to go out and the stars look for aliens

1:31:28.520 --> 1:31:29.840
 just here on earth.

1:31:29.840 --> 1:31:32.920
 Do you think that's a serious possibility

1:31:32.920 --> 1:31:35.200
 that we should explore with the tools of science?

1:31:35.200 --> 1:31:36.880
 Like this should be a serious effort.

1:31:36.880 --> 1:31:39.560
 I think yes and no.

1:31:39.560 --> 1:31:44.280
 And I mean, yes, because I think it's a serious hypothesis

1:31:44.280 --> 1:31:46.360
 and I think it's worth exploring.

1:31:46.360 --> 1:31:48.880
 And it is certainly more economical

1:31:48.880 --> 1:31:52.080
 to look for signs of alien life on earth

1:31:52.080 --> 1:31:54.200
 than it is to go and build spacecraft

1:31:54.200 --> 1:31:56.320
 and send robots to other planets.

1:31:56.320 --> 1:31:58.360
 And that was one of the reasons it was proposed is,

1:31:58.360 --> 1:32:01.120
 well, if we do find an example of another original life

1:32:01.120 --> 1:32:03.240
 on earth, it's hugely informative

1:32:03.240 --> 1:32:05.480
 because it means the origin of life is not a rare event.

1:32:05.480 --> 1:32:08.040
 If it happened twice on the same planet,

1:32:08.040 --> 1:32:09.560
 that means it's probably pretty probable

1:32:09.560 --> 1:32:11.680
 given conditions are right.

1:32:11.680 --> 1:32:14.160
 So it has huge potential scientific impact,

1:32:14.160 --> 1:32:16.560
 not to mention the fact that you might have like biochemistry

1:32:16.560 --> 1:32:18.400
 and stuff that's informative for like medicine

1:32:18.400 --> 1:32:19.240
 and stuff like that.

1:32:19.240 --> 1:32:23.320
 But I think the thing for me that's challenging about it

1:32:23.320 --> 1:32:24.720
 and this really comes from my own work,

1:32:24.720 --> 1:32:28.920
 like thinking about life as a planetary scale process

1:32:28.920 --> 1:32:31.000
 and also trying to understand

1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:33.120
 sometimes what I call like the statistical mechanics

1:32:33.120 --> 1:32:35.680
 of biochemistry, but large scale statistical patterns

1:32:35.680 --> 1:32:38.480
 in the chemistry that life uses on earth.

1:32:38.480 --> 1:32:40.720
 There are a lot of regularities there

1:32:40.720 --> 1:32:45.720
 and life does seem to have planetary scale organization

1:32:45.720 --> 1:32:47.880
 that's consistent even with some of the patterns

1:32:47.880 --> 1:32:49.240
 that we see at the individual scale.

1:32:49.240 --> 1:32:51.920
 So if you think life is a planetary scale phenomenon

1:32:51.920 --> 1:32:55.800
 and the chemistry of life has to be sort of not just,

1:32:55.800 --> 1:32:58.080
 it's not, an individual is not necessarily

1:32:58.080 --> 1:33:00.080
 the fundamental unit of life, right?

1:33:00.080 --> 1:33:01.240
 The fundamental unit of life

1:33:01.240 --> 1:33:05.280
 is these informational lineages and they're kind of,

1:33:05.280 --> 1:33:08.320
 they intersect over spatial scales.

1:33:08.320 --> 1:33:10.400
 So everything on earth is kind of related

1:33:10.400 --> 1:33:12.520
 by the common causal history.

1:33:12.520 --> 1:33:15.200
 So it's hard for me based on the way I think

1:33:15.200 --> 1:33:18.040
 about the physics and also some of the stuff

1:33:18.040 --> 1:33:19.960
 that my group has done to really think

1:33:19.960 --> 1:33:23.000
 that there could be evidence

1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:25.160
 or there could be a second sample of life on earth.

1:33:25.160 --> 1:33:26.320
 But I think there are ways

1:33:26.320 --> 1:33:28.560
 that we need to be more concrete about that.

1:33:28.560 --> 1:33:31.200
 And I have thought a little bit about like,

1:33:32.080 --> 1:33:33.480
 like you can represent the chemistry

1:33:33.480 --> 1:33:35.680
 in an individual cell as a network.

1:33:35.680 --> 1:33:39.360
 And then those networks, something my group has shown

1:33:39.360 --> 1:33:42.520
 actually scale with the same property.

1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:43.920
 So ecosystems have the same properties

1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:46.080
 as individuals as planetary scale.

1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:47.120
 And then you could imagine

1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:49.600
 if you had alien chemistry intermixed in there,

1:33:49.600 --> 1:33:50.960
 that scaling would be broken.

1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:52.800
 So if there's some robustness property

1:33:52.800 --> 1:33:54.560
 or something associated to it,

1:33:54.560 --> 1:33:56.040
 and you get alien chemistry in there,

1:33:56.040 --> 1:33:57.120
 it just breaks everything.

1:33:57.120 --> 1:34:00.720
 And you don't have a planetary ecosystem functioning

1:34:02.200 --> 1:34:04.600
 and individuals functioning across all these scales.

1:34:04.600 --> 1:34:06.160
 So I guess what I'm arguing

1:34:06.160 --> 1:34:08.400
 is life is not a scale dependent phenomenon.

1:34:08.400 --> 1:34:10.240
 It's not just cellular life.

1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:11.520
 So if you have a shadow biosphere,

1:34:11.520 --> 1:34:13.560
 it has to be integrated with all of these other scales.

1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:16.160
 And that would lose the meaning

1:34:16.160 --> 1:34:17.480
 of the word shadow biosphere, I guess.

1:34:17.480 --> 1:34:18.520
 I think so, yeah.

1:34:18.520 --> 1:34:21.280
 So it's an open question, right?

1:34:21.280 --> 1:34:23.160
 And I think it would tell us a lot.

1:34:23.160 --> 1:34:25.560
 So there has been very minimal effort

1:34:25.560 --> 1:34:28.160
 of people to look for a shadow biosphere.

1:34:28.160 --> 1:34:29.200
 But then the question,

1:34:29.200 --> 1:34:32.440
 it could be possible that there's like

1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:37.160
 sufficiently distinct planets within one planet,

1:34:37.160 --> 1:34:40.000
 meaning like environments within one planet.

1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:41.320
 Like, I don't know.

1:34:42.520 --> 1:34:44.200
 I've been looking recently

1:34:45.160 --> 1:34:47.600
 because of having a chat with Catherine Duclair

1:34:47.600 --> 1:34:49.240
 about Io, the moon of Jupiter,

1:34:49.240 --> 1:34:51.600
 that's like all volcanoes and volcanoes are bad ass.

1:34:51.600 --> 1:34:56.600
 But like, imagining life inside volcanoes, right?

1:34:58.760 --> 1:35:03.000
 It seems like sufficiently chemically different

1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:05.440
 like to be living in the darkness

1:35:05.440 --> 1:35:06.640
 where there's a lot of heat

1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:10.960
 and maybe you could have different Earths on a planet.

1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:12.680
 Or like if you go deep enough in the crust,

1:35:12.680 --> 1:35:14.360
 maybe there's like a layer where there's no life.

1:35:14.360 --> 1:35:15.840
 And then there's suddenly life again.

1:35:15.840 --> 1:35:18.880
 And maybe those, you know, lizard men

1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:20.760
 or whatever they are that people dream about

1:35:20.760 --> 1:35:22.640
 are really down there.

1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:24.120
 I know that's a little flippant,

1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:26.760
 but really like there could be like chemical cycles

1:35:26.760 --> 1:35:29.000
 deep in the Earth's crust that might be alive

1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:30.240
 and are completely distinct

1:35:30.240 --> 1:35:33.400
 in chemical origin to surface life.

1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:35.400
 Right, that they wouldn't be interacting with each other.

1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:36.600
 Yeah, and that's one of the proposals

1:35:36.600 --> 1:35:38.080
 for the shadow biosphere is like,

1:35:38.080 --> 1:35:40.840
 sometimes people talk about it as being geologically

1:35:40.840 --> 1:35:43.640
 or geographically distinct that it might be,

1:35:43.640 --> 1:35:45.160
 you know, you have no life for this region

1:35:45.160 --> 1:35:46.680
 and then a different example.

1:35:46.680 --> 1:35:47.880
 And then sometimes people talk about it

1:35:47.880 --> 1:35:49.280
 being chemically distinct,

1:35:49.280 --> 1:35:51.560
 that the chemistry is sufficiently different,

1:35:51.560 --> 1:35:52.880
 that it's completely orthogonal

1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:54.400
 or non interacting with our chemistry.

1:35:54.400 --> 1:35:55.920
 It seems to me at least the chemistry

1:35:55.920 --> 1:36:00.920
 is a more powerful boundary than geographic.

1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:06.320
 It just seems like life finds a way literally to travel.

1:36:06.320 --> 1:36:08.200
 Yeah, it does.

1:36:08.200 --> 1:36:11.440
 What do you think about all these UFO sightings?

1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:14.000
 So to me, it's really inspiring.

1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:18.120
 It's yet another localized way to dream

1:36:18.120 --> 1:36:21.560
 about the mysterious that is out there.

1:36:21.560 --> 1:36:24.560
 Yeah, so I've actually been more intrigued

1:36:24.560 --> 1:36:26.480
 by the cultural phenomena UFOs

1:36:26.480 --> 1:36:28.360
 than the phenomena UFOs themselves,

1:36:28.360 --> 1:36:30.760
 because I think it's intriguing about how

1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:35.400
 we are preparing ourselves mentally

1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:37.520
 for understanding others

1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:39.640
 and how we have thought about that historically

1:36:39.640 --> 1:36:44.280
 and what the sort of modern incarnations of that are.

1:36:44.280 --> 1:36:47.440
 It's more like, I want an explanation for us.

1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:48.640
 That's my motivation.

1:36:48.640 --> 1:36:50.440
 And having some, you know,

1:36:50.440 --> 1:36:52.120
 streaks across the sky or something

1:36:52.120 --> 1:36:53.120
 and saying that's aliens,

1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:55.720
 it doesn't tell you anything.

1:36:55.720 --> 1:36:57.520
 So unless you have a deeper explanation

1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:00.400
 and you have, you know, more lines of,

1:37:00.400 --> 1:37:02.680
 you know, where is this gonna take us in the future?

1:37:02.680 --> 1:37:04.720
 It's just not as interesting to me

1:37:04.720 --> 1:37:06.760
 as the problem of understanding life itself

1:37:06.760 --> 1:37:08.720
 and aliens as a more general phenomenon.

1:37:08.720 --> 1:37:11.000
 I do think it's, just as you said,

1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:13.920
 a good way to psychologically and sociologically

1:37:13.920 --> 1:37:15.840
 prepare ourselves to sort of like,

1:37:15.840 --> 1:37:17.440
 what would that look like?

1:37:17.440 --> 1:37:18.680
 And very importantly,

1:37:18.680 --> 1:37:21.440
 which is what a lot of people talk about politically,

1:37:21.440 --> 1:37:24.480
 sort of there's this idea from the,

1:37:24.480 --> 1:37:27.640
 so I came from the Soviet Union of like the Cold War

1:37:27.640 --> 1:37:30.080
 and we have to hide secrets.

1:37:30.080 --> 1:37:33.440
 There's some way in us searching for life on other planets

1:37:33.440 --> 1:37:36.000
 or our searching for life in general,

1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:40.840
 the way we've done government in the past,

1:37:40.840 --> 1:37:43.280
 we tend to think of all new things

1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:45.160
 as potential military secrets,

1:37:45.160 --> 1:37:46.880
 so we want to hide them.

1:37:46.880 --> 1:37:49.240
 And one of the ways that people kind of look

1:37:49.240 --> 1:37:51.680
 at UFO sightings is like,

1:37:51.680 --> 1:37:53.520
 like maybe we shouldn't hide this stuff.

1:37:53.520 --> 1:37:55.080
 Like what is the government hiding?

1:37:55.080 --> 1:37:57.920
 I think that's a really, you know,

1:37:57.920 --> 1:38:00.120
 in one sense it's a conspiratorial question,

1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:02.400
 but I think in another,

1:38:02.400 --> 1:38:07.320
 it's an inspiration to change the way we do government

1:38:07.320 --> 1:38:09.960
 to where secrets don't,

1:38:09.960 --> 1:38:12.440
 maybe there are times when you want to keep secrets

1:38:12.440 --> 1:38:13.440
 as military secrets,

1:38:13.440 --> 1:38:15.920
 but maybe we need to release a lot more stuff

1:38:15.920 --> 1:38:19.040
 and see us as a human species as together

1:38:19.040 --> 1:38:20.160
 in this whole search.

1:38:20.160 --> 1:38:21.720
 Yeah, the public engagement part there

1:38:21.720 --> 1:38:23.840
 is really interesting.

1:38:23.840 --> 1:38:25.680
 And it's almost like a challenge

1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:27.920
 to the way we've done stuff in the past

1:38:27.920 --> 1:38:30.320
 in terms of keeping secrets when they're not,

1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:33.280
 so like the first step,

1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:36.560
 if you don't know how something works,

1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:38.440
 if there's a mysterious thing,

1:38:38.440 --> 1:38:42.080
 the first instinct should not be like, let's hide it.

1:38:42.080 --> 1:38:44.040
 Let's put it in the closet.

1:38:44.040 --> 1:38:46.000
 So that the Chinese or the Russian government

1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.840
 or whatever government doesn't find it.

1:38:48.840 --> 1:38:53.080
 Maybe the first instinct should be, let's understand it.

1:38:53.080 --> 1:38:54.720
 Perhaps let's understand it together.

1:38:54.720 --> 1:38:55.760
 Right.

1:38:55.760 --> 1:38:57.000
 No, I think that's good.

1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:58.720
 And something I realized recently

1:38:58.720 --> 1:39:00.120
 that I never thought was gonna be a problem,

1:39:00.120 --> 1:39:02.640
 but I think this actually helps with quite a bit

1:39:02.640 --> 1:39:05.800
 is because so many people nowadays

1:39:05.800 --> 1:39:08.160
 believe we've already made contact,

1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:10.840
 that as an astrobiologist,

1:39:10.840 --> 1:39:14.600
 if we actually want to understand life and make contact,

1:39:14.600 --> 1:39:17.360
 we kind of have to deconstruct the narratives

1:39:17.360 --> 1:39:18.600
 we've already built from ourselves

1:39:18.600 --> 1:39:19.920
 and kind of unteach ourselves

1:39:19.920 --> 1:39:22.640
 that we've learned about aliens and then reteach ourselves.

1:39:22.640 --> 1:39:26.040
 So there's this really interesting sort of dialogue there

1:39:26.040 --> 1:39:27.840
 and making it open to the public

1:39:27.840 --> 1:39:29.560
 that they actually have to think critically about it

1:39:29.560 --> 1:39:30.960
 and they see the evidence for themselves,

1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:33.800
 I think is really important for that process.

1:39:33.800 --> 1:39:38.200
 Yeah, that aliens might be way weirder than we can imagine.

1:39:38.200 --> 1:39:39.320
 Yes.

1:39:39.320 --> 1:39:41.920
 Yes, I'm pretty sure they're probably weirder

1:39:41.920 --> 1:39:42.920
 than we can imagine.

1:39:44.120 --> 1:39:49.120
 Okay, we've in 2020 and still living through a pandemic,

1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:54.120
 setting the political and all those kinds of things aside,

1:39:54.120 --> 1:39:58.200
 I've always found viruses fascinating

1:39:58.200 --> 1:40:03.200
 as dynamical systems, I was gonna say living systems,

1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:07.160
 but I've always kind of thought of them as living,

1:40:07.160 --> 1:40:09.560
 but that's a whole nother kind of discussion.

1:40:09.560 --> 1:40:13.280
 Maybe it'd be great to put that on the table.

1:40:13.280 --> 1:40:17.520
 One, do you find viruses beautiful slash terrifying?

1:40:17.520 --> 1:40:21.560
 And two, do you think they're living things

1:40:21.560 --> 1:40:25.800
 or there's some aspect to them per our discussion of life

1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:27.760
 that makes them living?

1:40:27.760 --> 1:40:30.120
 I mean, living in a pandemic saying viruses are beautiful

1:40:30.120 --> 1:40:30.960
 is probably a hard thing,

1:40:30.960 --> 1:40:34.520
 but I do find them beautiful to a degree.

1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:39.520
 I think even in the sense of mediating a global pandemic,

1:40:39.760 --> 1:40:41.440
 there's something like deeply intriguing there

1:40:41.440 --> 1:40:46.200
 because these are tiny, tiny little things, right?

1:40:46.200 --> 1:40:51.200
 And yet they can essentially cause a seizure

1:40:52.520 --> 1:40:55.840
 or handicap an entire civilization at a global scale.

1:40:55.840 --> 1:40:58.520
 So just that intersection between

1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:02.640
 our perceived invincibility and our susceptibility to things

1:41:02.640 --> 1:41:04.840
 and also the interaction across scales of those things

1:41:04.840 --> 1:41:09.280
 is just a really amazing feature of our world.

1:41:09.280 --> 1:41:12.680
 Most technology, whether it's viruses or AI

1:41:12.680 --> 1:41:16.440
 that can scale in an exponential way,

1:41:16.440 --> 1:41:21.360
 like kind of run as opposed to like,

1:41:21.360 --> 1:41:24.800
 one thing makes another thing makes another thing,

1:41:24.800 --> 1:41:26.520
 it's one thing makes two things

1:41:26.520 --> 1:41:28.720
 and those two things make four things.

1:41:28.720 --> 1:41:30.960
 Like that kind of process

1:41:32.200 --> 1:41:34.800
 also seems to be fundamental to life.

1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:35.640
 Yes.

1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:40.000
 And it's terrifying because in a matter of,

1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:43.360
 in a very short time scale, it can,

1:41:45.320 --> 1:41:48.760
 if it's good at being life, whatever that is,

1:41:48.760 --> 1:41:52.520
 it can quickly overtake the other competing forms of life.

1:41:52.520 --> 1:41:53.520
 Right.

1:41:53.520 --> 1:41:57.680
 And that's scary both for AI and for viruses.

1:41:57.680 --> 1:42:00.560
 And it seems like understanding these processes

1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:02.000
 that are underlying viruses.

1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:05.240
 And I don't mean like on the virology or biology side,

1:42:05.240 --> 1:42:09.800
 but on some kind of more computational physics perspective

1:42:09.800 --> 1:42:11.320
 as we've been talking about,

1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:15.680
 seems to be really important to figure out

1:42:15.680 --> 1:42:19.120
 how humans can survive.

1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:20.520
 Right.

1:42:20.520 --> 1:42:23.960
 Along with this kind of life

1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:26.840
 and perhaps becoming a multi planetary species

1:42:26.840 --> 1:42:28.680
 is a part of that.

1:42:28.680 --> 1:42:31.640
 Like there's no, maybe like we'll figure out

1:42:31.640 --> 1:42:33.280
 from a physics perspective is like,

1:42:33.280 --> 1:42:38.040
 there's no way any living system

1:42:38.040 --> 1:42:40.760
 can be stable for prolonged period of time

1:42:40.760 --> 1:42:43.680
 and survive unless it expands exponentially throughout.

1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:46.200
 Like we have to multiply.

1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:49.880
 Otherwise anything that doesn't multiply exponentially

1:42:49.880 --> 1:42:50.840
 will die eventually.

1:42:50.840 --> 1:42:52.440
 Maybe that's a fundamental law.

1:42:54.120 --> 1:42:56.000
 Maybe, I don't know.

1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:58.920
 I always get really bothered by these Darwinian narratives

1:42:58.920 --> 1:43:01.720
 that are like the fittest replicator wins and things.

1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:03.120
 And I don't, I just don't feel like

1:43:03.120 --> 1:43:04.720
 that's exactly what's going on.

1:43:04.720 --> 1:43:06.440
 I think like the copying of information

1:43:06.440 --> 1:43:10.440
 is sort of ancillary to this other process of creativity.

1:43:10.440 --> 1:43:12.360
 Right, so like the drive is actually,

1:43:12.360 --> 1:43:13.720
 the drive is creativity,

1:43:13.720 --> 1:43:16.000
 but if you wanna keep the creativity

1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:17.480
 that's existed in the past,

1:43:17.480 --> 1:43:19.600
 it has to be copied into the future.

1:43:19.600 --> 1:43:23.240
 So replication, like if you, so that for me is,

1:43:23.240 --> 1:43:26.280
 so I had this set of arguments with Michael Lockman

1:43:26.280 --> 1:43:29.520
 and Lee Cronin about the like life being about persistence.

1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:30.720
 They thought it was about persistence

1:43:30.720 --> 1:43:32.320
 and like survival of the fittest kind of thing.

1:43:32.320 --> 1:43:33.840
 And I'm like, no, it's about existence.

1:43:33.840 --> 1:43:36.680
 It's like, cause when you're talking about that,

1:43:36.680 --> 1:43:38.640
 it's easy to say that in retrospect,

1:43:38.640 --> 1:43:40.800
 you can post select on the things that survived

1:43:40.800 --> 1:43:43.000
 and then say why they survived,

1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:46.280
 but you can't do that going forward.

1:43:46.280 --> 1:43:47.960
 That's really profound

1:43:47.960 --> 1:43:52.160
 that survival is just a nice little side effect feature

1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:56.560
 of maximizing creativity, but it doesn't need to be there.

1:43:56.560 --> 1:43:58.520
 Yeah, I like that. That's really beautiful.

1:43:58.520 --> 1:44:01.800
 Yeah, I know, like I said, I like optimistic theories.

1:44:01.800 --> 1:44:03.120
 Well, I don't know if that's optimistic.

1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:06.120
 That could be terrifying to people because,

1:44:06.120 --> 1:44:09.360
 because a system that maximizes creativity

1:44:09.360 --> 1:44:13.040
 may very quickly get rid of humans for some reason,

1:44:13.040 --> 1:44:15.920
 if it comes up with some other creative,

1:44:15.920 --> 1:44:20.000
 I mean, forms of existence, right?

1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:24.240
 This is the AI thing is like the moment you have an AI system

1:44:24.240 --> 1:44:28.960
 that can flourish in the space of ideas

1:44:28.960 --> 1:44:33.360
 or in some other space much more effectively than humans.

1:44:33.360 --> 1:44:36.600
 And it's sufficiently integrated into the physical space

1:44:36.600 --> 1:44:39.160
 to be able to modify the environment.

1:44:39.160 --> 1:44:40.280
 I think we'll just be like

1:44:40.280 --> 1:44:42.040
 the core genetic architecture or something.

1:44:42.040 --> 1:44:44.400
 We'll be like the DNA for AI, right?

1:44:44.400 --> 1:44:46.440
 It's like, we haven't lost the past informational

1:44:46.440 --> 1:44:47.720
 architectures on this planet.

1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:48.760
 They're still there.

1:44:49.840 --> 1:44:53.840
 Yeah, so the AI will use our brains in some part

1:44:53.840 --> 1:44:58.000
 to like ride, like accelerate the exchange of ideas.

1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:00.960
 That's the neural language dream is that,

1:45:00.960 --> 1:45:03.480
 well, the humans will be still around

1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:05.320
 because you're saying architecture.

1:45:05.320 --> 1:45:06.400
 Yeah, but I don't even think

1:45:06.400 --> 1:45:08.320
 they necessarily need to tap into our brains.

1:45:08.320 --> 1:45:10.400
 I mean, just collectively, we do interesting things.

1:45:10.400 --> 1:45:12.160
 What if they were just using like the patterns

1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:14.720
 in our communication or something?

1:45:14.720 --> 1:45:18.080
 Oh, without controlling it, just observing?

1:45:18.080 --> 1:45:19.000
 Well, I don't know.

1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:20.720
 In what sense do you control the chemistry

1:45:20.720 --> 1:45:21.880
 happening in your body?

1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:25.200
 Yeah.

1:45:25.200 --> 1:45:27.320
 I mean, obviously I don't know.

1:45:27.320 --> 1:45:31.280
 I'm just, like the way I look at, like people look at AI

1:45:31.280 --> 1:45:33.480
 and then they look at this thing that's bigger than us

1:45:33.480 --> 1:45:36.040
 and is coming in the future and is smarter than us.

1:45:36.040 --> 1:45:38.640
 And I think though that looking at the past history

1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:40.600
 of life on the planet and what information

1:45:40.600 --> 1:45:42.240
 has been doing for the last 4 billion years

1:45:42.240 --> 1:45:44.840
 is probably very informative to asking questions

1:45:44.840 --> 1:45:46.160
 about what's coming next.

1:45:47.760 --> 1:45:49.120
 And I don't,

1:45:50.560 --> 1:45:53.360
 one is planetary scale transitions are really important

1:45:53.360 --> 1:45:54.320
 for new phases.

1:45:54.320 --> 1:45:56.600
 So the global internet and sort of global integration

1:45:56.600 --> 1:45:58.440
 of our technology, I think is an important thing.

1:45:58.440 --> 1:46:01.040
 So that's again, life is a planetary scale phenomenon

1:46:01.040 --> 1:46:03.280
 but we're an integrated component of that phenomenon.

1:46:03.280 --> 1:46:04.920
 I don't really see that the technology

1:46:04.920 --> 1:46:07.040
 is gonna replace us in that way.

1:46:07.040 --> 1:46:09.800
 It's just gonna keep scaffolding and building.

1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:11.320
 And I also don't have an idea

1:46:11.320 --> 1:46:12.680
 that we're gonna build AI in a box.

1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:14.440
 I think AI is gonna emerge.

1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:17.120
 AGI to me is a planetary scale phenomena

1:46:17.120 --> 1:46:19.880
 that's gonna emerge from our technology.

1:46:19.880 --> 1:46:22.240
 Planetary scale phenomena.

1:46:22.240 --> 1:46:26.120
 But do you think an AGI is not distinct from humans?

1:46:26.120 --> 1:46:27.440
 The whole package.

1:46:27.440 --> 1:46:28.280
 The whole package, yeah.

1:46:28.280 --> 1:46:30.080
 Comes as a planetary scale phenomena.

1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:31.640
 And that goes back to the fact that like,

1:46:31.640 --> 1:46:34.840
 you were asking questions about you as an individual.

1:46:34.840 --> 1:46:36.120
 Like, what are you as an individual?

1:46:36.120 --> 1:46:38.040
 You're like a packet of information

1:46:38.040 --> 1:46:41.320
 that exists in the particular physical thing that is you.

1:46:41.320 --> 1:46:43.680
 We're all just packets of information.

1:46:43.680 --> 1:46:45.600
 And some of us are aggregates in certain ways

1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:47.080
 but it's all just kind of exchanging

1:46:47.080 --> 1:46:48.200
 and propagating, right?

1:46:48.200 --> 1:46:49.600
 And processing.

1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:52.600
 Is your packet of information

1:46:52.600 --> 1:46:56.000
 that you've continually referred to as Sarah

1:46:56.000 --> 1:47:01.000
 afraid of the dissipation of the death of that packet?

1:47:01.160 --> 1:47:03.000
 Are you afraid of death?

1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:04.640
 Do you ponder death?

1:47:04.640 --> 1:47:07.240
 Does death have meaning in this process

1:47:07.240 --> 1:47:09.240
 of creativity?

1:47:09.240 --> 1:47:12.280
 I think I have the natural biological urge

1:47:12.280 --> 1:47:13.880
 that everyone has to fear death.

1:47:15.480 --> 1:47:17.760
 I think the thing that I think is interesting

1:47:17.760 --> 1:47:20.160
 is if I think about it rationally,

1:47:20.160 --> 1:47:22.040
 I'm not necessarily afraid of death for me

1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:25.240
 because I won't be aware of being dead.

1:47:25.240 --> 1:47:26.680
 But I am afraid like for my kids

1:47:26.680 --> 1:47:28.760
 because it matters to them if I die.

1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:33.680
 So again, like I think death becomes more significant

1:47:33.680 --> 1:47:37.280
 as a collective property, not as an individual one.

1:47:37.280 --> 1:47:39.240
 Yeah, but isn't there something to fear

1:47:39.240 --> 1:47:41.640
 about the fact that the way,

1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:45.560
 like the creative,

1:47:46.920 --> 1:47:48.520
 the complexity of information

1:47:48.520 --> 1:47:51.040
 that's been like created in you.

1:47:51.040 --> 1:47:52.040
 Yeah.

1:47:52.040 --> 1:47:57.040
 The fact that it kind of breaks apart and disappears.

1:47:57.640 --> 1:47:59.560
 It doesn't, but I don't think it disappears.

1:47:59.560 --> 1:48:00.960
 It's just not me anymore.

1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:05.960
 Right, but that process of it being not you anymore,

1:48:06.120 --> 1:48:07.960
 that doesn't scare you?

1:48:07.960 --> 1:48:08.960
 Of course it does.

1:48:08.960 --> 1:48:09.800
 The mystery of it.

1:48:09.800 --> 1:48:10.640
 I mean, the...

1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:12.320
 Yeah, but I guess I'm heartened by the fact

1:48:12.320 --> 1:48:14.000
 that there will be some imprints of the fact

1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:16.960
 that I existed still in the universe after I leave it.

1:48:16.960 --> 1:48:18.360
 Yeah, but there'll be a...

1:48:18.360 --> 1:48:19.200
 Okay, but...

1:48:19.200 --> 1:48:21.720
 And also that has to do with my perception of time, right?

1:48:21.720 --> 1:48:23.760
 So, I perceive time as flowing,

1:48:23.760 --> 1:48:25.280
 but that might not be the case.

1:48:26.800 --> 1:48:29.960
 I mean, this is standard physicist comfort is,

1:48:29.960 --> 1:48:33.560
 every moment exists and there's no...

1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:38.560
 And the flow of time is just our perception of us changing.

1:48:41.040 --> 1:48:43.400
 So, you can travel back in time and that's comforting?

1:48:43.400 --> 1:48:44.800
 Like from a physicist's concept?

1:48:44.800 --> 1:48:45.640
 No, no, no.

1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:46.800
 I'm not talking about traveling back in time.

1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:49.400
 I'm just saying that the moments in the past still exist.

1:48:50.400 --> 1:48:52.640
 Now, whether the moments in the future exist or not

1:48:52.640 --> 1:48:53.800
 is a different question.

1:48:53.800 --> 1:48:57.040
 That's not comforting to me in terms of death.

1:48:57.040 --> 1:48:58.960
 The flow of time is not...

1:48:58.960 --> 1:49:03.960
 I think there's no comfort in the face of death

1:49:04.080 --> 1:49:07.880
 for what we are because we like existing.

1:49:07.880 --> 1:49:11.560
 And I think it's especially true if you love life

1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:13.680
 and you love what life is.

1:49:13.680 --> 1:49:16.160
 Do you think there's a certain sense in which

1:49:16.160 --> 1:49:19.120
 the fear of death or the fear of nonexistence,

1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:21.360
 maybe fear is not the right word,

1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:26.360
 is the actual very phenomena that gives birth to existence?

1:49:26.360 --> 1:49:28.480
 Like, death is fundamental.

1:49:28.480 --> 1:49:31.560
 It just feels like freaking out, oh shit,

1:49:31.560 --> 1:49:36.560
 this ride ends is actually like the...

1:49:36.560 --> 1:49:40.760
 That's the thing that gives birth to this whole thing.

1:49:40.760 --> 1:49:41.600
 Yeah.

1:49:41.600 --> 1:49:45.080
 That like, it's constantly...

1:49:45.080 --> 1:49:48.120
 It's matter constantly freaking out about the fact

1:49:48.120 --> 1:49:48.960
 that it's gonna be the most.

1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:51.080
 No, I think things like to exist.

1:49:51.080 --> 1:49:51.920
 I think they wanna exist.

1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:55.240
 Yeah, there's a desire, whatever, to exist.

1:49:55.240 --> 1:49:56.080
 Yeah.

1:49:56.080 --> 1:49:57.960
 There's a drive to exist

1:49:57.960 --> 1:50:00.000
 and there's a drive for more things to exist.

1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:03.000
 I guess, yeah, I like existing.

1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:07.560
 I like it a lot and I don't know it any other way.

1:50:09.280 --> 1:50:11.960
 See, I don't even know if I like existing.

1:50:11.960 --> 1:50:14.520
 I think I really don't like not existing.

1:50:14.520 --> 1:50:15.360
 Yes.

1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:16.200
 Yeah, that's true.

1:50:17.440 --> 1:50:19.760
 Yeah, maybe it's that.

1:50:19.760 --> 1:50:23.320
 Some days I might like existing less than others.

1:50:23.320 --> 1:50:27.600
 Yes, but like, I think those are like surface feelings.

1:50:27.600 --> 1:50:28.440
 Yeah, yeah.

1:50:28.440 --> 1:50:29.880
 It seems like there's something fundamental

1:50:29.880 --> 1:50:31.240
 about wanting to exist.

1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:32.080
 No, I think that's right.

1:50:32.080 --> 1:50:35.720
 But I think to your point that that might go back

1:50:35.720 --> 1:50:39.120
 to the more fundamental idea that, you know,

1:50:39.120 --> 1:50:40.640
 if life is the physics of existence

1:50:40.640 --> 1:50:43.040
 and maximizing existence, individual organisms,

1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:45.520
 of course, wanna maximize their existence

1:50:45.520 --> 1:50:48.000
 and everything, you know, like wants to exist.

1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.560
 But I guess for me, the small comfort is

1:50:50.560 --> 1:50:54.480
 my existence matters to future existence.

1:50:54.480 --> 1:50:57.320
 Speaking of future existence, is there advice

1:50:57.320 --> 1:51:00.880
 you can give to future pockets of existences,

1:51:00.880 --> 1:51:04.160
 AKA young people, about life?

1:51:04.160 --> 1:51:07.240
 You've had, you've worn many hats.

1:51:07.240 --> 1:51:09.120
 You've taken on some of the biggest problems

1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:10.400
 in the universe.

1:51:10.400 --> 1:51:13.000
 Is there advice you can give to young people

1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:17.280
 about life, about career, about existing?

1:51:17.280 --> 1:51:20.520
 Yeah, maybe not about the last one.

1:51:20.520 --> 1:51:23.400
 You know, a lot of people ask me this question

1:51:23.400 --> 1:51:25.880
 about like working on such hard problems,

1:51:25.880 --> 1:51:28.160
 like how can you make a successful career out of that?

1:51:28.160 --> 1:51:31.280
 But I think for me, it couldn't be otherwise.

1:51:31.280 --> 1:51:33.280
 Like I have to, to be fulfilled,

1:51:33.280 --> 1:51:35.240
 you have to work on things you care about.

1:51:35.240 --> 1:51:36.840
 And that's always kind of driven me.

1:51:36.840 --> 1:51:39.800
 And that's been discipline, department,

1:51:41.720 --> 1:51:44.880
 and sort of superficial level problem independent

1:51:44.880 --> 1:51:48.360
 because I started at community college actually,

1:51:48.360 --> 1:51:49.680
 and I was taking a physics class

1:51:49.680 --> 1:51:53.080
 and I learned about magnetic monopoles

1:51:53.080 --> 1:51:55.440
 and we didn't know if they existed in the universe,

1:51:55.440 --> 1:51:57.880
 but we could predict them and we could go look for them.

1:51:57.880 --> 1:51:59.520
 And I was so deeply intrigued by this idea

1:51:59.520 --> 1:52:02.440
 that we had this mathematical formula to go look for things.

1:52:02.440 --> 1:52:05.120
 And then I wanted to become a theoretical physicist

1:52:05.120 --> 1:52:05.960
 because of that.

1:52:05.960 --> 1:52:07.680
 But that actually wasn't my driving question.

1:52:07.680 --> 1:52:10.600
 I realized my driving question is the nature

1:52:10.600 --> 1:52:12.120
 of the correspondence between our minds

1:52:12.120 --> 1:52:14.360
 and physical reality and what we are.

1:52:14.360 --> 1:52:16.480
 And that question is very deep,

1:52:16.480 --> 1:52:18.560
 so you can work across a lot of fields doing that.

1:52:18.560 --> 1:52:20.040
 But I think without that driving question,

1:52:20.040 --> 1:52:22.280
 I never would have been able to do all the things

1:52:22.280 --> 1:52:23.120
 that I've done.

1:52:23.120 --> 1:52:25.080
 It's really the passion that drives it.

1:52:25.080 --> 1:52:28.480
 And usually when students ask me these kinds of questions,

1:52:28.480 --> 1:52:31.800
 I tell them like, you have to find something

1:52:31.800 --> 1:52:33.240
 you really care about working on

1:52:33.240 --> 1:52:35.440
 because if you don't really care about it,

1:52:35.440 --> 1:52:37.880
 A, you're not gonna be your best at it,

1:52:37.880 --> 1:52:39.800
 and B, it's not gonna be worth your time.

1:52:39.800 --> 1:52:41.520
 Why would you spend your time working on something

1:52:41.520 --> 1:52:43.040
 you're not interested in?

1:52:43.040 --> 1:52:44.760
 So find the driving questions.

1:52:44.760 --> 1:52:46.000
 Yeah, find the driving question.

1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:47.480
 Find your passion.

1:52:47.480 --> 1:52:49.440
 I mean, I think passion makes a huge difference

1:52:49.440 --> 1:52:52.720
 in terms of creativity, talent, and potential,

1:52:52.720 --> 1:52:55.040
 and also being able to tolerate all the hard things

1:52:55.040 --> 1:52:57.880
 that come with any career or life.

1:52:57.880 --> 1:52:59.840
 Yeah, I've had a bunch of moments in my life

1:52:59.840 --> 1:53:01.800
 where I've just been captivated

1:53:01.800 --> 1:53:03.200
 by some beautiful phenomena.

1:53:03.200 --> 1:53:06.080
 And I guess being rigorous about it

1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:09.520
 and asking what is the question underlying this phenomena,

1:53:09.520 --> 1:53:13.400
 like robots bring a smile to my face

1:53:13.400 --> 1:53:17.040
 and forming a question of like,

1:53:17.040 --> 1:53:19.960
 why the hell is this so fascinating?

1:53:19.960 --> 1:53:23.200
 Why is this, specifically the human robot

1:53:23.200 --> 1:53:27.040
 interaction question that something beautiful

1:53:27.040 --> 1:53:30.720
 is brought to life when humans and robots interact,

1:53:30.720 --> 1:53:32.560
 understanding that deeply.

1:53:33.640 --> 1:53:36.640
 It's like, okay, so this is gonna be my life work then.

1:53:36.640 --> 1:53:37.760
 I don't know what the hell it is,

1:53:37.760 --> 1:53:39.640
 but that's what I wanna do.

1:53:39.640 --> 1:53:40.480
 Interesting.

1:53:40.480 --> 1:53:43.000
 And doing that for whatever the hell gives you

1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:45.320
 that kind of feeling, I guess, is the point.

1:53:45.320 --> 1:53:46.520
 Yeah.

1:53:46.520 --> 1:53:47.880
 Am I allowed to ask you a question?

1:53:47.880 --> 1:53:48.720
 Sure.

1:53:48.720 --> 1:53:49.800
 Okay.

1:53:49.800 --> 1:53:50.920
 On that point,

1:53:50.920 --> 1:53:53.880
 because I had this colleague that suggested the idea

1:53:53.880 --> 1:53:56.160
 that consciousness might be contagious.

1:53:56.160 --> 1:53:58.240
 And so interacting with things,

1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:01.000
 it's an interesting idea, right?

1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:04.440
 So I'm wondering sort of the motivation there.

1:54:04.440 --> 1:54:08.560
 Is it the motivation that you want more of the universe

1:54:08.560 --> 1:54:11.280
 to appreciate things the way we do

1:54:11.280 --> 1:54:12.760
 and appreciate those interactions?

1:54:12.760 --> 1:54:15.760
 Or is it really more the enjoyment of the human

1:54:15.760 --> 1:54:16.600
 in those interactions?

1:54:16.600 --> 1:54:20.320
 Like, is it, do you know what I'm asking?

1:54:20.320 --> 1:54:21.160
 Yeah, yeah.

1:54:21.160 --> 1:54:23.800
 See, I think consciousness is created

1:54:23.800 --> 1:54:27.520
 in the interaction between things.

1:54:27.520 --> 1:54:28.360
 Yes, I agree.

1:54:28.360 --> 1:54:31.160
 So the joy is in the creation of consciousness.

1:54:31.160 --> 1:54:32.000
 I see.

1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:35.120
 I really like the idea that

1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:38.560
 it doesn't just have to be two humans

1:54:38.560 --> 1:54:40.080
 creating consciousness together.

1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:43.400
 It could be humans and other entities.

1:54:43.400 --> 1:54:46.520
 We talked offline about dogs and other pets and so on.

1:54:46.520 --> 1:54:49.720
 There's a magic, I mean, I've been calling it love.

1:54:49.720 --> 1:54:54.320
 It's this beauty of the human experience that's created.

1:54:54.320 --> 1:54:58.200
 And it just feels like fascinating that you could do that

1:54:58.200 --> 1:55:00.560
 with a robotic system.

1:55:00.560 --> 1:55:01.400
 Right.

1:55:01.400 --> 1:55:06.400
 And there's something really powerful, at least to me,

1:55:06.880 --> 1:55:10.400
 about engineering systems that allow you

1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:12.560
 to create some of the magic of the human experience.

1:55:12.560 --> 1:55:15.440
 Cause then you get to understand what it takes,

1:55:15.440 --> 1:55:17.920
 at least get inklings of what it takes

1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:21.360
 to create consciousness.

1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:24.280
 And I don't get this, you know,

1:55:24.280 --> 1:55:26.240
 philosophers get really upset about this idea

1:55:26.240 --> 1:55:29.640
 that sort of the illusion of consciousness is consciousness.

1:55:29.640 --> 1:55:33.680
 But I really liked the idea of engineering systems

1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:37.240
 that fool you into thinking they're conscious.

1:55:37.240 --> 1:55:38.080
 Right.

1:55:38.080 --> 1:55:41.880
 Because that's sufficient to create the magical experience.

1:55:41.880 --> 1:55:43.520
 Right, because it's the interaction, yeah.

1:55:43.520 --> 1:55:44.520
 It's the interaction, yeah.

1:55:44.520 --> 1:55:45.360
 Right.

1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:47.600
 And this is the Russian hat I wear,

1:55:47.600 --> 1:55:51.000
 which is like, I think there's an ocean of loneliness

1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:51.920
 in the world.

1:55:51.920 --> 1:55:53.440
 I think we're deeply lonely.

1:55:53.440 --> 1:55:57.200
 We're not even allowing ourselves to acknowledge that.

1:55:57.200 --> 1:56:00.800
 And I kind of think that's what love is between romantic love

1:56:00.800 --> 1:56:05.800
 and friendship is two people kind of getting a little bit

1:56:05.800 --> 1:56:10.800
 like alleviating for brief moment.

1:56:11.400 --> 1:56:12.240
 That loneliness.

1:56:12.240 --> 1:56:15.280
 That loneliness, but not, but we're not there.

1:56:15.280 --> 1:56:17.920
 It's not the full aspect of that loneliness.

1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:19.360
 Like we're desperately alone.

1:56:19.360 --> 1:56:22.560
 We're desperately afraid of nonexisting.

1:56:22.560 --> 1:56:23.400
 Right.

1:56:23.400 --> 1:56:24.560
 I have that kind of sense.

1:56:24.560 --> 1:56:28.160
 And I just want to explore that ocean of loneliness more.

1:56:28.160 --> 1:56:29.000
 Right.

1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:30.840
 When engineering, like create a submarine

1:56:30.840 --> 1:56:33.720
 that goes into the depth of that loneliness.

1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:36.560
 So creating systems that can truly hear you.

1:56:36.560 --> 1:56:37.400
 Right.

1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:38.240
 And truly listen.

1:56:38.240 --> 1:56:39.800
 Make the universe a less lonely place.

1:56:39.800 --> 1:56:40.960
 Exactly.

1:56:40.960 --> 1:56:43.160
 Let me ask you about the meaning.

1:56:43.160 --> 1:56:44.800
 You've brought up why.

1:56:44.800 --> 1:56:45.640
 Yeah.

1:56:45.640 --> 1:56:46.480
 The physics of why.

1:56:46.480 --> 1:56:51.120
 What do you think is the meaning of our particular planets,

1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:54.600
 set of existences and the universe in general?

1:56:56.120 --> 1:56:57.040
 The meaning of life.

1:56:57.040 --> 1:56:57.880
 Yes.

1:56:57.880 --> 1:56:59.040
 Someone once told me as a physicist,

1:56:59.040 --> 1:57:00.800
 I'm not allowed to ask why questions,

1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:01.960
 but I don't believe that.

1:57:01.960 --> 1:57:06.960
 So I think what we are is the creative process

1:57:10.240 --> 1:57:11.400
 in the universe, I think.

1:57:11.400 --> 1:57:13.160
 And for me, that's the meaning.

1:57:14.240 --> 1:57:18.160
 The ability to create more possibilities

1:57:18.160 --> 1:57:19.480
 and more things to exist.

1:57:19.480 --> 1:57:23.760
 What is, Dostoevsky has the saying,

1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:25.760
 beauty will save the world.

1:57:25.760 --> 1:57:30.760
 What is, is there a connection between creation and beauty?

1:57:33.280 --> 1:57:34.120
 I think so.

1:57:35.040 --> 1:57:39.320
 So is that like, is beauty a correlate of creation?

1:57:39.320 --> 1:57:40.160
 It might be.

1:57:40.160 --> 1:57:41.160
 I don't know.

1:57:41.160 --> 1:57:43.280
 I mean, why is it, you know,

1:57:43.280 --> 1:57:44.720
 a lot of people have asked these kinds of questions,

1:57:44.720 --> 1:57:47.200
 but like, why is it we have such an emotional response

1:57:47.200 --> 1:57:49.800
 to intellectual activity or creativity?

1:57:49.800 --> 1:57:52.440
 And that seems kind of a deep question to me.

1:57:52.440 --> 1:57:55.560
 Like, it seems very intrinsic to what we are.

1:57:55.560 --> 1:57:59.840
 So I do have an interest in the questions I ask

1:57:59.840 --> 1:58:01.240
 because I think they're beautiful

1:58:01.240 --> 1:58:02.880
 and I think the universe is beautiful.

1:58:02.880 --> 1:58:06.360
 And I'm just so deeply fascinated

1:58:06.360 --> 1:58:08.320
 by the fact that I exist at all.

1:58:10.400 --> 1:58:13.920
 And so maybe it's that, you know,

1:58:13.920 --> 1:58:15.600
 that intrinsic feeling of beauty

1:58:15.600 --> 1:58:17.400
 that's in part driving, you know,

1:58:17.400 --> 1:58:19.000
 the physics of creating more things.

1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:22.080
 So they could be deeply related in that way.

1:58:22.080 --> 1:58:24.680
 Well, I don't think there's a better way to end it.

1:58:24.680 --> 1:58:27.120
 I think this conversation was beautiful.

1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:29.760
 Thank you so much for wasting

1:58:29.760 --> 1:58:31.920
 all your valuable time with me today.

1:58:31.920 --> 1:58:33.520
 I really, really appreciate it, Sarah.

1:58:33.520 --> 1:58:34.360
 This is an honor.

1:58:34.360 --> 1:58:36.000
 I hope we get the chance to talk again.

1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:38.120
 I hope, like I mentioned to you offline,

1:58:38.120 --> 1:58:39.560
 we get a chance to talk with Lee.

1:58:39.560 --> 1:58:44.560
 You guys have a beautiful, like, intellectual chemistry

1:58:44.560 --> 1:58:45.760
 that's fascinating to listen to.

1:58:45.760 --> 1:58:47.120
 So I'm a huge fan of both of you

1:58:47.120 --> 1:58:49.440
 and I can't wait to see what you do next.

1:58:49.440 --> 1:58:50.280
 Thanks so much.

1:58:50.280 --> 1:58:51.320
 Great to be here.

1:58:51.320 --> 1:58:52.160
 I am.

1:58:52.880 --> 1:58:54.400
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

1:58:54.400 --> 1:58:57.680
 with Sarah Walker and thank you to Athletic Greens,

1:58:57.680 --> 1:59:01.120
 Nat Sweet, Blinkist, and Magic Spoon.

1:59:01.120 --> 1:59:04.360
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

1:59:04.360 --> 1:59:06.040
 And now let me leave you with some words

1:59:06.040 --> 1:59:09.480
 from Robert Frost, one of my favorite poets.

1:59:09.480 --> 1:59:11.640
 In three words, I can sum up everything

1:59:11.640 --> 1:59:13.560
 I've learned about life.

1:59:13.560 --> 1:59:15.120
 It goes on.

1:59:16.240 --> 1:59:17.200
 Thank you for listening.

1:59:17.200 --> 1:59:44.200
 I hope to see you next time.
