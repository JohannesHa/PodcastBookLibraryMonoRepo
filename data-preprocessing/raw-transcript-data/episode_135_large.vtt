00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
 The following is a conversation with Charles Isbell,

00:03.120 --> 00:06.320
 Dean of the College of Computing at Georgia Tech,

00:06.320 --> 00:10.640
 a researcher and educator in the field of artificial intelligence,

00:10.640 --> 00:17.280
 and someone who deeply thinks about what exactly is the field of computing and how do we teach it.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.640
 He also has a fascinatingly varied set of interests including music,

00:22.640 --> 00:28.080
 books, movies, sports, and history that make him especially fun to talk with.

00:28.080 --> 00:32.800
 When I first saw him speak, his charisma immediately took over the room,

00:32.800 --> 00:35.600
 and I had a stupid excited smile on my face,

00:35.600 --> 00:39.280
 and I knew I had to eventually talk to him on this podcast.

00:39.280 --> 00:43.680
 Quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode.

00:44.240 --> 00:48.000
 First is Neuro, the maker of functional sugar free gum

00:48.000 --> 00:51.600
 and mints that I use to give my brain a quick caffeine boost.

00:52.240 --> 00:56.880
 Second is Decoding Digital, a podcast on tech and entrepreneurship

00:56.880 --> 00:58.240
 that I listen to and enjoy.

00:59.120 --> 01:04.880
 Third is Masterclass, online courses that I watch from some of the most amazing humans in history.

01:04.880 --> 01:10.000
 And finally, Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends for food and drinks.

01:10.560 --> 01:16.160
 Please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast.

01:16.160 --> 01:21.200
 As a side note, let me say that I'm trying to make it so that the conversations with Charles,

01:21.200 --> 01:27.520
 Eric Weinstein, and Dan Carlin will be published before Americans vote for president on November 3rd.

01:28.080 --> 01:31.280
 There's nothing explicitly political in these conversations,

01:31.280 --> 01:37.760
 but they do touch on something in human nature that I hope can bring context to our difficult time,

01:37.760 --> 01:42.400
 and maybe, for a moment, allow us to empathize with people we disagree with.

01:43.120 --> 01:45.760
 With Eric, we talk about the nature of evil.

01:45.760 --> 01:51.360
 With Charles, besides AI and music, we talk a bit about race in America,

01:51.360 --> 01:56.880
 and how we can bring more love and empathy to our online communication.

01:56.880 --> 02:01.680
 And with Dan Carlin, well, we talk about Alexander the Great,

02:01.680 --> 02:07.840
 Genghis Khan, Hitler, Stalin, and all the complicated parts of human history in between,

02:07.840 --> 02:13.120
 with a hopeful eye toward a brighter future for our humble, little civilization here on Earth.

02:13.120 --> 02:18.400
 The conversation with Dan will hopefully be posted tomorrow, on Monday, November 2nd.

02:19.360 --> 02:24.000

02:30.080 --> 02:34.320
 And now, here's my conversation with Charles Isbell.

02:35.280 --> 02:39.040
 You've mentioned that you love movies and TV shows.

02:39.040 --> 02:44.640
 Let's ask an easy question, but you have to be definitively, objectively, conclusive.

02:44.640 --> 02:46.960
 What's your top three movies of all time?

02:47.680 --> 02:50.320
 So, you're asking me to be definitive and to be conclusive.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.920
 That's a little hard. I'm going to tell you why.

02:51.920 --> 02:56.160
 It's very simple. It's because movies is too broad of a category.

02:56.160 --> 02:59.920
 I got to pick subgenres, but I will tell you that of those genres,

02:59.920 --> 03:03.920
 I'll pick one or two from each of the genres, and I'll get us to three, so I'm going to cheat.

03:03.920 --> 03:10.000
 So, my favorite comedy of all times, which is probably my favorite movie of all time,

03:10.000 --> 03:14.320
 is His Girl Friday, which is probably a movie that you've not ever heard of,

03:14.320 --> 03:19.120
 but it's based on a play called The Front Page from, I don't know, early 1900s.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.280
 And the movie is a fantastic film.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.080
 What's the story? What's the independent film?

03:26.080 --> 03:27.120
 No, no, no. What are we talking about?

03:27.120 --> 03:31.120
 This is one of the movies that would have been very popular. It's a screwball comedy.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.920
 You ever see Moonlighting, the TV show? You know what I'm talking about?

03:33.920 --> 03:38.320
 So, you've seen these shows where there's a man and a woman, and they clearly are in love with one another,

03:38.320 --> 03:40.960
 and they're constantly fighting and always talking over each other.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.560
 Banter, banter, banter, banter, banter.

03:43.280 --> 03:46.880
 This was the movie that started all that, as far as I'm concerned.

03:46.880 --> 03:53.280
 It's very much of its time. So, it's, I don't know, must have come out sometime between 1934 and 1939.

03:53.280 --> 03:57.040
 I'm not sure exactly when the movie itself came out. It's black and white.

03:57.040 --> 04:01.840
 It's just a fantastic film, and it's hilarious.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.840
 So, it's mostly conversation?

04:03.840 --> 04:07.440
 Not entirely, but mostly, mostly. Just a lot of back and forth.

04:07.440 --> 04:14.480
 There's a story there. Someone's on death row, and they're newspaper men, including her.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.280
 They're all newspaper men. They were divorced.

04:17.280 --> 04:21.600
 The editor, the publisher, I guess, and the reporter, they were divorced.

04:22.400 --> 04:25.360
 But, you know, they clearly, he's thinking, trying to get back together,

04:25.360 --> 04:27.120
 and there's this whole other thing that's going on.

04:27.120 --> 04:28.720
 But none of that matters. The plot doesn't matter.

04:28.720 --> 04:31.440
 Yeah, it's just a little play in conversation.

04:31.440 --> 04:35.680
 It's fantastic. And I just love everything about the conversation, because at the end of the day,

04:35.680 --> 04:38.160
 sort of narrative and conversation are the sort of things that drive me.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.640
 And so, I really like that movie for that reason.

04:41.280 --> 04:44.640
 Similarly, I'm now going to cheat, and I'm going to give you two movies as one.

04:45.360 --> 04:48.640
 And they're Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and John Wick.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.440
 Both relatively modern. John Wick, of course.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.560
 One, two, or three?

04:52.560 --> 04:56.000
 One. It gets increasingly, I love them all for different reasons,

04:56.000 --> 04:59.440
 and increasingly more ridiculous. Kind of like Loving Alien and Aliens,

04:59.440 --> 05:01.520
 despite the fact they're two completely different movies.

05:01.520 --> 05:06.000
 But the reason I put Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and John Wick together is because I

05:06.000 --> 05:09.680
 actually think they're the same movie, or what I like about them, the same movie.

05:09.680 --> 05:15.440
 Which is both of them create a world that you're coming in the middle of,

05:15.440 --> 05:20.000
 and they don't explain it to you. But the story is done so well that you pick it up.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.760
 So, anyone who's seen John Wick, you know, you have these little coins,

05:23.760 --> 05:25.680
 and they're headed out, and there are these rules,

05:25.680 --> 05:28.240
 and apparently every single person in New York City is an assassin.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.360
 There's like two people who come through who aren't, but otherwise they are.

05:31.360 --> 05:34.080
 But there's this complicated world, and everyone knows each other.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.920
 They don't sit down and explain it to you, but you figure it out.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.000
 Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a lot like that.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.280
 You get the feeling that this is chapter nine of a 10 part story,

05:41.280 --> 05:44.400
 and you've missed the first eight chapters, and they're not going to explain it to you,

05:44.400 --> 05:45.920
 but there's this sort of rich world behind you.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.280
 You get pulled in anyway, like immediately.

05:47.280 --> 05:50.880
 You get pulled in anyway. So, it's just excellent storytelling in both cases,

05:50.880 --> 05:51.840
 and very, very different.

05:51.840 --> 05:54.480
 And also you like the outfit, I assume? The John Wick outfit?

05:54.480 --> 05:58.000
 Oh yeah, of course. Well, of course. Yes. I think John Wick outfit is perfect.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.760
 And so that's number two, and thenâ€¦

05:59.760 --> 06:03.920
 But sorry to pause on that. Martial arts? You have a long list of hobbies.

06:03.920 --> 06:07.680
 Like it scrolls off the page, but I didn't see martial arts as one of them.

06:07.680 --> 06:10.240
 I do not do martial arts, but I certainly watch martial arts.

06:10.240 --> 06:14.000
 Oh, I appreciate it very much. Oh, we could talk about every Jackie Chan movie ever made,

06:14.000 --> 06:15.600
 and I would be on board with that.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.880
 The Shower, too? Like that kind of comedy of a cop?

06:18.880 --> 06:24.160
 Yes, yes. By the way, my favorite Jackie Chan movie would be Drunken Master 2,

06:25.120 --> 06:27.680
 known in the States usually as Legend of the Drunken Master.

06:29.200 --> 06:33.360
 Actually, Drunken Master, the first one, is the first kung fu movie I ever saw,

06:33.360 --> 06:34.880
 but I did not know that.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.000
 First Jackie Chan movie?

06:36.000 --> 06:40.640
 No, first one ever that I saw and remember, but I had no idea that that's what it was,

06:40.640 --> 06:43.200
 and I didn't know that was Jackie Chan. That was like his first major movie.

06:43.200 --> 06:46.320
 Yeah. I was a kid. It was done in the 70s.

06:46.320 --> 06:49.680
 I only later rediscovered that that was actually.

06:49.680 --> 06:57.360
 And he creates his own martial art by drinking. Was he actually drinking or was he played drinking?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.600
 You mean as an actor or as a character?

06:59.600 --> 07:04.240
 No. I'm sure as an actor. He was in the 70s or whatever.

07:04.240 --> 07:09.440
 He was definitely drinking, and in the end, he drinks industrial grade alcohol.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.480
 Ah, yeah.

07:10.480 --> 07:15.040
 Yeah, and has one of the most fantastic fights ever in that subgenre.

07:15.040 --> 07:18.080
 Anyway, that's my favorite one of his movies, but I'll tell you the last movie.

07:19.280 --> 07:22.880
 It's actually a movie called Nothing But a Man, which is the 1960s,

07:23.760 --> 07:31.840
 starred Ivan Dixon, who you'll know from Hogan's Heroes, and Abby Lincoln.

07:31.840 --> 07:35.040
 It's just a really small little drama. It's a beautiful story.

07:35.040 --> 07:41.440
 But my favorite scenes, I'm cheating, one of my favorite movies just for the ending is The

07:41.440 --> 07:47.360
 Godfather. I think the last scene of that is just fantastic. It's the whole movie all summarized in

07:47.360 --> 07:48.400
 just eight, nine seconds.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.440
 Godfather Part One?

07:49.440 --> 07:50.240
 Part One.

07:50.240 --> 07:54.880
 How does it end? I don't think you need to worry about spoilers if you haven't seen The Godfather.

07:54.880 --> 08:01.920
 Spoiler alert. It ends with the wife coming to Michael, and he says,

08:01.920 --> 08:06.400
 just this once, I'll let you ask me my business. And she asks him if he did this terrible thing,

08:06.400 --> 08:10.800
 and he looks her in the eye and he lies, and he says, no. And she says, thank you. And she

08:10.800 --> 08:19.920
 walks out the door, and you see her going out of the door, and all these people are coming in,

08:19.920 --> 08:24.720
 and they're kissing Michael's hands, and Godfather. And then the camera switches

08:24.720 --> 08:29.760
 perspective. So instead of looking at him, you're looking at her, and the door

08:29.760 --> 08:33.840
 closes in her face, and that's the end of the movie. And that's the whole movie right there.

08:33.840 --> 08:37.440
 Do you see parallels between that and your position as Dean at Georgia Tech Chrome?

08:37.440 --> 08:39.520
 Just kidding. Trick question.

08:39.520 --> 08:44.160
 Sometimes, certainly. The door gets closed on me every once in a while.

08:44.160 --> 08:51.120
 Okay. That was a rhetorical question. You've also mentioned that you, I think, enjoy all kinds of

08:51.120 --> 08:56.320
 experiments, including on yourself. But I saw a video where you said you did an experiment where

08:56.320 --> 09:03.440
 you tracked all kinds of information about yourself and a few others sort of wiring up your

09:03.440 --> 09:09.520
 home. And this little idea that you mentioned in that video, which is kind of interesting, that

09:10.240 --> 09:16.960
 you thought that two days worth of data is enough to capture majority of the behavior of the human

09:16.960 --> 09:23.440
 being. First, can you describe what the heck you did to collect all the data? Because it's

09:23.440 --> 09:28.320
 fascinating, just like little details of how you collect that data and also what your intuition

09:28.320 --> 09:32.960
 behind the two days is. So first off, it has to be the right two days. But I was thinking of a

09:32.960 --> 09:36.480
 very specific experiment. There's actually a suite of them that I've been a part of, and other people

09:36.480 --> 09:40.320
 have done this, of course. I just sort of dabbled in that part of the world. But to be very clear,

09:40.320 --> 09:45.600
 the specific thing that I was talking about had to do with recording all the IR going on in my

09:46.160 --> 09:50.480
 infrared going on in my house. So this is a long time ago. So this is everything's being curled

09:50.480 --> 09:56.960
 by pressing buttons on remote controls, as opposed to speaking to Alexa or Siri or someone like that.

09:56.960 --> 10:01.280
 And I was just trying to figure out if you could get enough data on people to figure out what they

10:01.280 --> 10:05.120
 were going to do with their TVs or their lights. My house was completely wired up at the time.

10:06.400 --> 10:10.240
 But you know, what I'm about to look at a movie, I'm about to turn on the TV or whatever and just

10:10.240 --> 10:16.720
 see what I could predict from it. It was kind of surprising. It shouldn't have been. But that's all

10:16.720 --> 10:19.520
 very easy to do, by the way, just capturing all the little stuff. I mean, it's a bunch of computers

10:19.520 --> 10:22.880
 systems. It's really easy to capture today if you know what you're looking for. At Georgia Tech,

10:22.880 --> 10:27.200
 long before I got there, we had this thing called the Aware Home, where everything was wired up and

10:27.200 --> 10:31.200
 you captured everything that was going on. Nothing even difficult, not with video or anything like

10:31.200 --> 10:36.960
 that, just the way that the system was just capturing everything. So it turns out that,

10:37.920 --> 10:42.000
 and I did this with myself and then I had students and they worked with many other people. And it

10:42.000 --> 10:47.360
 turns out at the end of the day, people do the same things over and over and over again. So it

10:47.360 --> 10:51.840
 has to be the right two days, like a weekend. But it turns out not only can you predict what

10:51.840 --> 10:55.040
 someone's going to do next at the level of what button they're going to press next on a remote

10:55.040 --> 11:01.360
 control, but you can do it with something really, really simple. You don't even need a hidden mark

11:01.360 --> 11:05.440
 off model. It's like a mark, just simply, I press this, this is my prediction of the next thing.

11:05.440 --> 11:11.120
 It turns out you can get 93% accuracy just by doing something very simple and stupid and just

11:11.120 --> 11:15.520
 counting statistics. But what was actually more interesting is that you could use that information.

11:15.520 --> 11:21.440
 This comes up again and again in my work. If you try to represent people or objects by the things

11:21.440 --> 11:26.560
 they do, the things you can measure about them that have to do with action in the world. So

11:26.560 --> 11:32.400
 distribution over actions, and you try to represent them by the distribution of actions that are done

11:32.400 --> 11:38.240
 on them, then you do a pretty good job of sort of understanding how people are and they cluster

11:38.960 --> 11:44.000
 remarkably well, in fact, irritatingly so. And so by clustering people this way,

11:44.000 --> 11:49.360
 you can maybe, you know, I got the 93% accuracy of what's the next button you're going to press,

11:49.360 --> 11:54.240
 but I can get 99% accuracy or somewhere there's about on the collections of things you might

11:54.240 --> 11:58.480
 press. And it turns out the things that you might press are all related to number to each other and

11:58.480 --> 12:04.480
 exactly what you would expect. So for example, all the key, all the numbers on a keypad, it turns out

12:04.480 --> 12:08.640
 all have the same behavior with respect to you as a human being. And so you would naturally cluster

12:08.640 --> 12:14.640
 them together and you discover that numbers are all related to one another in some way and all

12:14.640 --> 12:18.400
 these other things. And then, and here's the part that I think is important. I mean, you can see

12:18.400 --> 12:25.280
 this in all kinds of things. Every individual is different, but any given individual is remarkably

12:25.280 --> 12:29.680
 predictable because you keep doing the same things over and over again. And the two things that I've

12:29.680 --> 12:34.960
 learned in the long time that I've been thinking about this is people are easily predictable and

12:34.960 --> 12:39.280
 people hate when you tell them that they're easily predictable, but they are. And there you go.

12:39.280 --> 12:46.160
 Yeah. What about, let me play devil's advocate and philosophically speaking, is it possible to

12:46.160 --> 12:52.480
 say that what defines humans is the outlier. So even though many, some large percentage of our

12:52.480 --> 12:57.760
 behaviors, whatever the signal we measure is the same and it would cluster nicely, but maybe it's

12:57.760 --> 13:03.200
 the special moments of when we break out of the routine is the definitive thing that we're

13:03.200 --> 13:07.920
 breaking out of the routine is the definitive things. And the way we break out of that routine

13:07.920 --> 13:11.520
 for each one of us might be different. It's possible. I would say that I would say it a

13:11.520 --> 13:15.920
 little differently. I think I would make two things. One is a, I'm going to disagree with

13:15.920 --> 13:22.880
 the premise, I think, but that's fine. I think the way I would put it is there are people who

13:22.880 --> 13:28.240
 are very different from lots of other people, but they're not 0%, they're closer to 10%, right? So

13:28.240 --> 13:31.760
 in fact, even if you do this kind of clustering of people, that'll turn out to be the small number

13:31.760 --> 13:36.960
 they all behave like each other, even if they individually behave very differently from everyone

13:36.960 --> 13:40.720
 else. So I think that's kind of important. But what you're really asking, I think, and I think

13:40.720 --> 13:46.160
 this is really a question is, what do you do when you're faced with the situation you've never seen

13:46.160 --> 13:49.600
 before? What do you do when you're faced with an extraordinary situation maybe you've seen others

13:49.600 --> 13:53.040
 do and you're actually forced to do something and you react to that very differently. And that is

13:53.040 --> 13:56.880
 the thing that makes you human. I would agree with that, at least at a philosophical level, that it's

13:56.880 --> 14:03.120
 the times when you are faced with something difficult, a decision that you have to make

14:04.080 --> 14:08.560
 where the answer isn't easy, even if you know what the right answer is, that's sort of what defines

14:08.560 --> 14:12.800
 you as the individual. And I think what defines people broadly, it's the hard problem. It's not

14:12.800 --> 14:17.600
 the easy problem. It's the thing that's going to hurt you. It's not even that it's difficult. It's

14:17.600 --> 14:22.880
 just that you know that the outcome is going to be highly suboptimal for you. And I do think that

14:22.880 --> 14:29.360
 that's a reasonable place to start for the question of what makes us human. So before we talk about

14:29.360 --> 14:33.440
 sort of explore the different ideas underlying interactive artificial intelligence, which we

14:33.440 --> 14:39.520
 are working on, let me just go along this thread to skip to kind of our world of social media,

14:39.520 --> 14:44.080
 which is something that at least on the artificial intelligence side you think about.

14:44.080 --> 14:51.840
 There's a popular narrative, I don't know if it's true, but that we have these silos in social

14:51.840 --> 14:58.400
 media and we have these clusterings, as you're kind of mentioning. And the idea is that, you know,

14:58.400 --> 15:06.320
 along that narrative is that, you know, we want to, we want to break each other out of those silos

15:06.320 --> 15:12.480
 so we can be empathetic to other people, to if you're a Democrat, you'd be empathetic to the

15:12.480 --> 15:17.680
 Republican. If you're Republican, you're empathetic Democrat. Those are just two silly bins that we

15:17.680 --> 15:24.160
 seem to be very excited about, but there's other binnings that we can think about. Is there, from

15:24.160 --> 15:29.360
 an artificial intelligence perspective, because you're just saying we cluster along the data,

15:29.840 --> 15:35.520
 but then interactive artificial intelligence is referring to throwing agents into that mix,

15:35.520 --> 15:41.600
 AI systems in that mix, helping us interacting with us humans and maybe getting us out of that

15:41.600 --> 15:47.600
 mix, maybe getting us out of those silos. Is that something that you think is possible? Do you see

15:48.720 --> 15:56.160
 a hopeful possibility for artificial intelligence systems in these large networks of people to get

15:56.160 --> 16:04.800
 us outside of our habits in at least the idea space to where we can sort of be empathetic to

16:04.800 --> 16:11.280
 other people's lived experiences, other people's points of view, you know, all that kind of stuff?

16:11.280 --> 16:16.000
 Yes, and I actually don't think it's that hard. Well, it's not hard in this sense. So imagine that

16:16.000 --> 16:22.720
 you can, let's just, let's make life simple for a minute. Let's assume that you can do a kind of

16:22.720 --> 16:28.720
 partial ordering over ideas or clusterings of behavior. It doesn't even matter what I mean here,

16:28.720 --> 16:31.920
 so long as there's some way that this is a cluster, this is a cluster, there's some edge

16:31.920 --> 16:35.280
 between them, right? And this is kind of, they don't quite touch even, or maybe they come very

16:35.280 --> 16:40.480
 close. If you can imagine that conceptually, then the way you get from here to here is not by going

16:40.480 --> 16:43.680
 from here to here. The way you get from here to here is you find the edge and you move slowly

16:43.680 --> 16:47.360
 together, right? And I think that machines are actually very good at that sort of thing once we

16:47.360 --> 16:51.840
 can kind of define the problem, either in terms of behavior or ideas or words or whatever. So it's

16:51.840 --> 16:55.840
 easy in the sense that if you already have the network and you know the relationships, you know,

16:55.840 --> 17:00.480
 the edges and sort of the strengths on them and you kind of have some semantic meaning for them,

17:00.480 --> 17:04.960
 the machine doesn't have to, you do as the designer, then yeah, I think you can kind of move

17:04.960 --> 17:08.880
 people along and sort of expand them. But it's harder than that. And the reason it's harder than

17:08.880 --> 17:13.920
 that, or sort of coming up with the network structure itself is hard, is because I'm gonna

17:13.920 --> 17:18.800
 tell you a story that someone else told me and I don't, I may get some of the details a little bit

17:18.800 --> 17:24.320
 wrong, but it's roughly, it roughly goes like this. You take two sets of people from the same

17:24.320 --> 17:29.600
 backgrounds and you want them to solve a problem. So you separate them up, which we do all the time,

17:29.600 --> 17:32.400
 right? Oh, you know, we're gonna break out in the, we're gonna break out groups. You're gonna go

17:32.400 --> 17:34.080
 over there and you're gonna talk about this. You're gonna go over there and you're gonna talk

17:34.080 --> 17:38.560
 about this. And then you have them sort of in this big room, but far apart from one another,

17:38.560 --> 17:43.040
 and you have them sort of interact with one another. When they come back to talk about what

17:43.040 --> 17:47.440
 they learn, you want to merge what they've done together. It can be extremely hard because they

17:47.440 --> 17:51.360
 don't, they basically don't speak the same language anymore. Like when you create these problems and

17:51.360 --> 17:55.440
 you dive into them, you create your own language. So the example this one person gave me, which I

17:56.160 --> 17:58.720
 found kind of interesting because we were in the middle of that at the time, was

17:58.720 --> 18:03.520
 they're sitting over there and they're talking about these rooms that you can see, but you're

18:03.520 --> 18:05.920
 seeing them from different vantage points, depending on what side of the room you're on.

18:06.880 --> 18:11.760
 They can see a clock very easily. And so they start referring to the room as the one with the clock.

18:12.960 --> 18:16.720
 This group over here, looking at the same room, they can see the clock, but it's, you know,

18:16.720 --> 18:21.120
 not in their line of sight or whatever. So they end up referring to it by some other way.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.080
 When they get back together and they're talking about things, they're referring to the same room

18:26.080 --> 18:29.040
 and they don't even realize they're referring to the same room. And in fact, this group doesn't

18:29.040 --> 18:32.480
 even see that there's a clock there and this group doesn't see whatever's the clock on the wall is

18:32.480 --> 18:36.160
 the thing that stuck with me. So if you create these different silos, the problem isn't that

18:36.160 --> 18:41.680
 the ideologies disagree. It's that you're using the same words and they mean radically different

18:41.680 --> 18:47.680
 things. The hard part is just getting them to agree on the, well, maybe we'd say the axioms in

18:47.680 --> 18:52.640
 our world, right? But you know, just get them to agree on some basic definitions because right now

18:52.640 --> 18:56.480
 they talk, they're talking past each other, just completely talking past each other. That's the

18:56.480 --> 19:01.120
 hard part, getting them to meet, getting them to interact. That may not be that difficult. Getting

19:01.120 --> 19:06.400
 them to see where their language is leading them to lead past one another. That's, that's the hard

19:06.400 --> 19:10.240
 part. It's a really interesting question to me. It could be on the layer of language, but it feels

19:10.240 --> 19:14.640
 like there's multiple layers to this. Like it could be worldview. It could be, I mean, all boils

19:14.640 --> 19:20.400
 down to empathy, being able to put yourself in the shoes of the other person to learn the language, to

19:20.400 --> 19:28.400
 learn like visually how they see the world, to learn like the, I mean, I experienced this now

19:28.400 --> 19:33.840
 with, with trolls, the, the degree of humor in that world. For example, I talk about love a lot.

19:33.840 --> 19:39.840
 I'm very like, I'm really lucky to have this amazing community of loving people. But whenever I

19:39.840 --> 19:45.440
 encounter trolls, they always roll their eyes at the idea of love because it's so quote unquote

19:45.440 --> 19:56.080
 cringe. So, so they, they show love by like derision, I would say. And I think about on the

19:56.080 --> 20:00.240
 human level, that's a whole nother discussion. That's psychology, that's sociology, so on. But

20:00.240 --> 20:10.400
 I wonder if AI systems can help somehow and to bridge the gap of what is this person's life like?

20:10.400 --> 20:16.800
 Encourage me to just ask that question, to put myself in their shoes, to experience the agitations,

20:16.800 --> 20:23.920
 the fears, the hopes they have, the, to experience, you know, the, to even just to think about what

20:23.920 --> 20:32.000
 was their upbringing like, like having a, a single parent home or a shitty education or all those

20:32.000 --> 20:37.760
 kinds of things, just to put myself in that mind space. It feels like that's really important.

20:37.760 --> 20:43.600
 For us to, to, to bring those clusters together, to find that similar language. But it's unclear

20:43.600 --> 20:48.880
 how AI can help that because it seems like AI systems need to understand both parties first.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.760
 So the, you know, the word understand, there's doing a lot of work, right?

20:51.760 --> 20:52.240
 Yes.

20:52.240 --> 20:57.840
 So do you have to understand it or do you just simply have to note that there is something

20:57.840 --> 21:04.480
 similar as a point to touch, right? So, you know, you use the word empathy and I like that word,

21:04.480 --> 21:07.600
 for a lot of reasons, I think you're right in the way that you're using in the ways you're describing,

21:07.600 --> 21:13.600
 but let's separate it from sympathy, right? So, you know, sympathy is feeling sort of for someone,

21:13.600 --> 21:16.720
 empathy is kind of understanding where they're coming from and how they, how they feel, right?

21:16.720 --> 21:22.480
 And for most people, those things go hand in hand. For some people, some are very good at empathy

21:22.480 --> 21:28.160
 and very, very bad at sympathy. Some people cannot experience, well, my observation would be,

21:28.160 --> 21:32.480
 I'm not a psychologist, my observation would be that some people seem to be very, very,

21:32.480 --> 21:37.680
 very bad at sympathy. My observation would be that some people seem incapable of feeling sympathy

21:37.680 --> 21:42.160
 unless they feel empathy first. You can understand someone, understand where they're coming from and

21:42.160 --> 21:48.160
 still think, no, I can't support that, right? It doesn't mean that the only way I, because if that,

21:48.160 --> 21:54.480
 if that isn't the case, then what it requires is that you, you must, the only way that you can,

21:54.480 --> 21:59.760
 to understand someone means you must agree with everything that they do, which isn't right, right?

21:59.760 --> 22:06.240
 I can feel for someone is to completely understand them and make them like me in some way. Well,

22:06.240 --> 22:10.480
 then we're lost, right? Because we're not all exactly like each other. I have to understand

22:10.480 --> 22:14.240
 everything that you've gone through. It helps clearly, but they're separable ideas, right?

22:14.240 --> 22:18.480
 Even though they get clearly, clearly tangled up in one another. So what I think AI could help you

22:18.480 --> 22:23.920
 do actually is if, and you know, I'm, I'm being quite fanciful as it were, but if you, if you

22:23.920 --> 22:28.000
 think of these as kind of, I understand how you interact, the words that you use, the, you know,

22:28.000 --> 22:30.720
 the actions you take, I have some way of doing this. Let's not worry about what that is.

22:31.840 --> 22:36.720
 But I can see you as a kind of distribution of experiences and actions taken upon you,

22:36.720 --> 22:41.360
 things you've done and so on. And I can do this with someone else and I can find the places where

22:41.360 --> 22:46.720
 there's some kind of commonality, a mapping as it were, even if it's not total, you know, the,

22:46.720 --> 22:50.400
 if I think of this as distribution, right, then, you know, I can take the cosine of the angle

22:50.400 --> 22:54.240
 between you and if it's, you know, if it's zero, you've got nothing in common. If it's one,

22:54.240 --> 22:59.760
 you're completely the same person. Well, you know, you're probably not one. You're almost certainly

22:59.760 --> 23:03.840
 not zero. I can find the place where there's the overlap, then I might be able to introduce you on

23:03.840 --> 23:09.200
 that basis or connect you in that, connect you in that way and make it easier for you to take that

23:09.200 --> 23:17.760
 step of that step of empathy. It's not, it's not impossible to do. Although I wonder if it requires

23:17.760 --> 23:22.000
 that everyone involved is at least interested in asking the question. So maybe the hard part

23:22.000 --> 23:24.800
 is just getting them interested in asking the question. In fact, maybe if you can get them to

23:24.800 --> 23:28.480
 ask the question, how are we more alike than we are different, they'll solve it themselves. Maybe

23:28.480 --> 23:32.640
 that's the problem that AI should be working on, not telling you how you're similar or different,

23:32.640 --> 23:37.520
 but just getting you to decide that it's worthwhile asking the question. It feels like an economist's

23:37.520 --> 23:43.040
 answer actually. Well, people, okay, first of all, people like would disagree. So let me disagree

23:43.040 --> 23:49.360
 slightly, which is, I think everything you said is brilliant, but I tend to believe philosophically

23:49.360 --> 23:57.600
 speaking that people are interested underneath it all. And I would say that AI, the, the possibility

23:57.600 --> 24:02.560
 that an AI system would show the commonality is incredible. That's a really good starting point.

24:02.560 --> 24:10.400
 I would say if you, if on social media, I could discover the common things deep or shallow between

24:10.400 --> 24:17.920
 me and a person who there's tension with, I think that my basic human nature would take over from

24:17.920 --> 24:25.280
 there. And I think enjoy that commonality. And like, there's something sticky about that, that

24:25.280 --> 24:31.520
 my mind will linger on and that person in my mind will become like warmer and warmer. And like, I'll

24:31.520 --> 24:35.520
 start to give a feel more and more compassion towards them. I think for majority of the

24:35.520 --> 24:40.800
 population, that's true, but that might be, that's a hypothesis. Yeah. I mean, it's an empirical

24:40.800 --> 24:44.480
 question, right? You'd have to figure it out. I mean, I want to believe you're right. And so I'm

24:44.480 --> 24:50.800
 going to say that I think you're right. Of course, some people come to those things for the purpose

24:50.800 --> 24:55.520
 of trolling, right? And it doesn't matter that they're playing a different game. Yeah. But I

24:55.520 --> 25:00.320
 don't know. I, you know, my experience is it requires two things. It requires, in fact, maybe

25:00.320 --> 25:03.920
 this is really at the end what you're saying. And I, and I do agree with this for sure. So

25:06.000 --> 25:14.080
 you, it's hard to hold onto that kind of anger or to hold onto just the desire to humiliate someone

25:14.080 --> 25:18.880
 for that long. It's just difficult to do. It takes, it takes a toll on you. But more importantly,

25:18.880 --> 25:23.520
 we know this both from people having done studies on it, but also from our own experiences,

25:23.520 --> 25:27.920
 that it is much easier to be dismissive of a person if they're not in front of you,

25:27.920 --> 25:35.040
 if they're not real, right? So much of the history of the world is about making people other, right?

25:35.040 --> 25:38.880
 So if you're social media, if you're on the web, if you're doing whatever in the internet,

25:38.880 --> 25:45.040
 but being forced to deal with someone as a person, some equivalent to being in the same room,

25:45.920 --> 25:49.360
 makes a huge difference. Cause then you're one, you're forced to deal with their humanity because

25:49.360 --> 25:52.800
 it's in front of you. The other is of course that, you know, they might punch you in the face

25:52.800 --> 25:56.560
 if you go too far. So, you know, both of those things kind of work together, I think to the,

25:56.560 --> 26:03.360
 to the right end. So I think bringing people together is really a kind of substitute for

26:03.360 --> 26:07.920
 forcing them to see the humanity in another person and to not be able to treat them as bits,

26:07.920 --> 26:11.440
 it's hard to troll someone when you're looking them in the eye. This is very difficult to do.

26:12.720 --> 26:18.960
 Agreed. Your broad set of research interests fall under interactive AI, as I mentioned,

26:18.960 --> 26:23.760
 which is a fascinating set of ideas and you have some concrete things that you're

26:23.760 --> 26:30.000
 particularly interested in, but maybe could you talk about how you think about the field of

26:30.000 --> 26:34.880
 interactive artificial intelligence? Sure. So let me say upfront that if you look at,

26:34.880 --> 26:38.480
 certainly my early work, but even if you look at most of it, I'm a machine learning guy,

26:39.600 --> 26:43.760
 right? I do machine learning. First paper ever published, it was in NIPS. Back then it was

26:43.760 --> 26:48.160
 NIPS. Now it's NeurIPS. It's a long story there. Anyway, that's another thing. But so,

26:48.160 --> 26:51.280
 so I'm a machine learning guy, right? I believe in data, I believe in statistics and all those

26:51.280 --> 26:55.360
 kinds of things. And the reason I'm bringing that up is even though I'm a newfangled statistical

26:55.360 --> 26:59.440
 machine learning guy and have been for a very long time, the problem I really care about is AI,

27:00.080 --> 27:04.480
 right? I care about artificial intelligence. I care about building some kind of

27:04.480 --> 27:12.160
 intelligent artifact. However that gets expressed, that would be at least as intelligent as humans

27:12.160 --> 27:18.320
 and as interesting as humans, perhaps in their own way. So that's the deep underlying love and

27:18.320 --> 27:24.640
 dream is the bigger AI. Whatever the heck that is. Yeah. The machine learning in some ways is

27:24.640 --> 27:29.360
 a means to the end. It is not the end. And I don't understand how one could be intelligent

27:29.360 --> 27:32.720
 without learning. So therefore I got to figure out how to do that, right? So that's important.

27:32.720 --> 27:37.200
 But machine learning, by the way, is also a tool. I said statistical, because that's what most

27:37.200 --> 27:40.720
 people think of themselves as machine learning people. That's how they think. I think Pat Langley

27:40.720 --> 27:46.240
 might disagree, or at least 1980s Pat Langley might disagree with what it takes to do machine

27:46.240 --> 27:50.480
 learning. But I care about the AI problem, which is why it's interactive AI, not just interactive

27:50.480 --> 27:55.120
 ML. I think it's important to understand that there's a longterm goal here, which I will

27:55.120 --> 27:59.040
 probably never live to see, but I would love to have been a part of, which is building something

27:59.040 --> 28:04.800
 truly intelligent outside of ourselves. Can we take a tiny tangent? Or am I interrupting,

28:04.800 --> 28:12.160
 which is, is there something you can say concrete about the mysterious gap between

28:12.800 --> 28:19.040
 the subset ML and the bigger AI? What's missing? What do you think? I mean, obviously it's

28:19.600 --> 28:25.040
 totally unknown, not totally, but in part unknown at this time, but is it something like with Pat

28:25.040 --> 28:29.120
 Langley, is it knowledge, like expert system reasoning type of kind of thing?

28:29.680 --> 28:35.440
 So AI is bigger than ML, but ML is bigger than AI. This is kind of the real problem here,

28:35.440 --> 28:39.360
 is that they're really overlapping things that are really interested in slightly different problems.

28:39.360 --> 28:42.240
 I tend to think of ML, and there are many people out there who are going to be very upset at me

28:42.240 --> 28:45.600
 about this, but I tend to think of ML being much more concerned with the engineering of solving a

28:45.600 --> 28:50.800
 problem, and AI about the sort of more philosophical goal of true intelligence. And that's the thing

28:50.800 --> 28:56.000
 that motivates me, even if I end up finding myself living in this kind of engineering ish space,

28:56.000 --> 29:02.160
 I've now made Michael Jordan upset. But to me, they just feel very different. You're just

29:02.160 --> 29:07.280
 measuring them differently, your goals of where you're trying to be are somewhat different.

29:07.280 --> 29:13.760
 But to me, AI is about trying to build that intelligent thing. And typically, but not always,

29:13.760 --> 29:17.920
 for the purpose of understanding ourselves a little bit better. Machine learning is, I think,

29:17.920 --> 29:22.560
 trying to solve the problem, whatever that problem is. Now, that's my take. Others, of course,

29:22.560 --> 29:28.000
 would disagree. So on that note, so with the interactive AI, do you tend to, in your mind,

29:28.000 --> 29:33.760
 visualize AI as a singular system, or is it as a collective huge amount of systems interacting

29:33.760 --> 29:40.640
 with each other? Like, is the social interaction of us humans and of AI systems the fundamental

29:40.640 --> 29:44.800
 to intelligence? I think, well, it's certainly fundamental to our kind of intelligence, right?

29:44.800 --> 29:50.160
 And I actually think it matters quite a bit. So the reason the interactive AI part matters to me

29:50.960 --> 29:59.280
 is because I don't, this is going to sound simple, but I don't care whether a tree makes a sound

30:00.000 --> 30:04.080
 when it falls and there's no one around, because I don't think it matters, right? If there's no

30:04.080 --> 30:08.480
 observer in some sense. And I think what's interesting about the way that we're intelligent

30:08.480 --> 30:13.760
 is we're intelligent with other people, right? Or other things anyway. And we go out of our way to

30:13.760 --> 30:18.960
 make other things intelligent. We're hardwired to find intention, even whether there is no intention,

30:18.960 --> 30:25.360
 why we anthropomorphize everything. I think the interactive AI part is being intelligent in and

30:25.360 --> 30:31.760
 of myself in isolation is a meaningless act in some sense. The correct answer is you have to

30:31.760 --> 30:35.360
 be intelligent in the way that you interact with others. It's also efficient because it allows you

30:35.360 --> 30:41.120
 to learn faster because you can import from past history. It also allows you to be efficient in

30:41.120 --> 30:46.880
 the transmission of that. So we ask ourselves about me. Am I intelligent? Clearly, I think so.

30:47.520 --> 30:51.680
 But I'm also intelligent as a part of a larger species and group of people, and we're trying to

30:51.680 --> 30:56.960
 move the species forward as well. And so I think that notion of being intelligent with others is

30:56.960 --> 31:01.920
 kind of the key thing because otherwise you come and you go, and then it doesn't matter. And so

31:01.920 --> 31:08.720
 that's why I care about that aspect of it. And it has lots of other implications. One is not just

31:08.720 --> 31:12.240
 building something intelligent with others, but understanding that you can't always communicate

31:12.240 --> 31:16.240
 with those others. They have been in a room where there's a clock on the wall that you haven't seen,

31:16.240 --> 31:20.160
 which means you have to spend an enormous amount of time communicating with one another constantly

31:20.720 --> 31:26.400
 in order to figure out what each other wants. So this is why people project, right? You project your

31:26.400 --> 31:30.800
 own intentions and your own reasons for doing things on the others as a way of understanding

31:30.800 --> 31:35.840
 them so that you know how to behave. But by the way, you, completely predictable person,

31:35.840 --> 31:39.280
 I don't know how you're predictable. I don't know you well enough, but you probably eat the same five

31:39.280 --> 31:43.920
 things over and over again or whatever it is that you do, right? I know I do. If I'm going to a new

31:43.920 --> 31:47.600
 Chinese restaurant, I will get general gals chicken because that's the thing that's easy.

31:47.600 --> 31:52.560
 I will get hot and sour soup. People do the things that they do, but other people get the chicken and

31:52.560 --> 31:56.960
 broccoli. I can push this analogy way too far. The chicken and broccoli. I don't know what's

31:56.960 --> 32:02.320
 wrong with those people. I don't know what's wrong with them either. We have all had our trauma.

32:02.320 --> 32:06.880
 So they get their chicken and broccoli and their egg drop soup or whatever. We got to communicate and

32:06.880 --> 32:13.200
 it's going to change, right? So interactive AI is not just about learning to solve a problem or a

32:13.200 --> 32:18.080
 task. It's about having to adapt that over time, over a very long period of time and interacting

32:18.080 --> 32:22.400
 with other people who will themselves change. This is what we mean about things like adaptable

32:22.400 --> 32:25.600
 models, right? That you have to have a model. That model is going to change. And by the way,

32:25.600 --> 32:28.960
 it's not just the case that you're different from that person, but you're different from the person

32:28.960 --> 32:33.760
 you were 15 minutes ago or certainly 15 years ago. And I have to assume that you're at least going

32:33.760 --> 32:38.480
 to drift, hopefully not too many discontinuities, but you're going to drift over time. And I have

32:38.480 --> 32:45.120
 to have some mechanism for adapting to that as you and an individual over time and across individuals

32:45.120 --> 32:51.200
 over time. On the topic of adaptive modeling and you talk about lifelong learning, which is

32:51.200 --> 32:59.760
 a, I think a topic that's understudied or maybe because nobody knows what to do with it. But like,

32:59.760 --> 33:04.880
 you know, if you look at Alexa or most of our artificial intelligence systems that are primarily

33:04.880 --> 33:10.960
 machine learning based systems or dialogue systems, all those kinds of things, they know very little

33:10.960 --> 33:21.360
 about you in the sense of the lifelong learning sense that we learn as humans, we learn a lot about

33:21.360 --> 33:31.280
 each other, not in the quantity effects, but like the temporally rich set of information that seems

33:31.280 --> 33:36.880
 to like pick up the crumbs along the way that somehow seems to capture a person pretty well.

33:36.880 --> 33:44.000
 Do you have any ideas how to do lifelong learning? Because it seems like most of the machine learning

33:44.000 --> 33:48.320
 community does not. No, well, by the way, not only does the machine learning community not spend a

33:48.320 --> 33:52.720
 lot of time on lifelong learning, I don't think they spend a lot of time on learning period in

33:52.720 --> 33:57.520
 the sense that they tend to be very task focused. Everybody is overfitting to whatever problem is

33:57.520 --> 34:01.920
 they happen to have. They're overengineering their solutions to the task. Even the people,

34:01.920 --> 34:06.000
 and I think these people too, are trying to solve a hard problem of transfer learning, right? I'm

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
 going to learn on one task and learn another task. You still end up creating the task. It's like

34:10.000 --> 34:13.280
 looking for your keys where the light is because that's where the light is, right? It's not because

34:13.280 --> 34:20.400
 the keys have to be there. I mean, one could argue that we tend to do this in general. As a group,

34:20.400 --> 34:26.160
 we tend to hill climb and get stuck in local optima. I think we do this in the small as well.

34:26.160 --> 34:32.960
 I think it's very hard to do. Here's the hard thing about AI. The hard thing about AI is it

34:32.960 --> 34:38.480
 keeps changing on us, right? What is AI? AI is the art and science of making computers act the way

34:38.480 --> 34:44.560
 they do in the movies, right? That's what it is, right? But beyond that. They keep coming up with

34:44.560 --> 34:52.080
 new movies. Yes. Right, exactly. We are driven by this kind of need to the ineffable quality of who

34:52.080 --> 34:57.360
 we are, which means that the moment you understand something is no longer AI, right? Well, we

34:57.360 --> 35:01.360
 understand this. That's just you take the derivative and you divide by two and then you average it out

35:01.360 --> 35:05.200
 over time in the window. Therefore, that's no longer AI. The problem is unsolvable because

35:05.200 --> 35:08.720
 it keeps kind of going away. This creates a kind of illusion, which I don't think is an entire

35:08.720 --> 35:12.560
 illusion, of either there's very simple task based things you can do very well and over engineer,

35:13.600 --> 35:18.640
 there's all of AI, and there's nothing in the middle. It's very hard to get from here to here,

35:18.640 --> 35:23.040
 and it's very hard to see how to get from here to here. I don't think that we've done

35:23.040 --> 35:27.360
 a very good job of it because we get stuck trying to solve the small problems in front of it,

35:27.360 --> 35:31.680
 myself included. I'm not going to pretend that I'm better at this than anyone else. Of course,

35:31.680 --> 35:37.840
 all the incentives in academia and in industry are set to make that very hard because you have

35:37.840 --> 35:41.680
 to get the next paper out, you have to get the next product out, you have to solve this problem,

35:41.680 --> 35:47.600
 and it's very sort of naturally incremental. None of the incentives are set up to allow you to take

35:47.600 --> 35:52.080
 a huge risk unless you're already so well established you can take that big risk.

35:53.600 --> 35:57.040
 If you're that well established that you can take that big risk, then you've probably spent

35:57.040 --> 36:01.680
 much of your career taking these little risks, relatively speaking, and so you have got a

36:01.680 --> 36:05.520
 lifetime of experience telling you not to take that particular big risk. So the whole system's

36:05.520 --> 36:10.080
 set up to make progress very slow. That's fine. It's just the way it is, but it does make this

36:10.080 --> 36:14.400
 gap seem really big, which is my long way of saying I don't have a great answer to it except

36:14.400 --> 36:21.120
 that stop doing n equals one. At least try to get n equal two and maybe n equal seven so that you

36:21.120 --> 36:25.120
 can say I'm going to, or maybe t is a better variable here. I'm going to not just solve this

36:25.120 --> 36:28.240
 problem and solve this problem and another problem. I'm not going to learn just on you.

36:28.240 --> 36:32.080
 I'm going to keep living out there in the world and just seeing what happens and that we'll learn

36:32.080 --> 36:36.800
 something as designers and our machine learning algorithms and our AI algorithms can learn as

36:36.800 --> 36:41.360
 well. But unless you're willing to build a system which you're going to have live for months at a

36:41.360 --> 36:47.120
 time in an environment that is messy and chaotic, you cannot control, then you're never going to

36:47.120 --> 36:51.440
 make progress in that direction. So I guess my answer to you is yes. My idea is that you should,

36:51.440 --> 36:57.760
 it's not no, it's yes. You should be deploying these things and making them live for a month

36:57.760 --> 37:02.000
 at a time and be okay with the fact that it's going to take you five years to do this. Not

37:02.000 --> 37:06.320
 rerunning the same experiment over and over again and refining the machine so it's slightly better

37:06.320 --> 37:12.320
 at whatever, but actually having it out there and living in the chaos of the world and seeing what

37:12.320 --> 37:16.800
 its learning algorithm say can learn, what data structure it can build and how it can go from

37:16.800 --> 37:22.000
 there. Without that, you're going to be stuck all the time. What do you think about the possibility

37:22.000 --> 37:28.720
 of N equals one growing, it's probably crude approximation, but growing like if you look at

37:28.720 --> 37:35.040
 language models like GPT3, if you just make it big enough, it'll swallow the world. Meaning like

37:35.040 --> 37:43.120
 it'll solve all your T to infinity by just growing in size of this, taking the small overengineered

37:43.120 --> 37:49.040
 solution and just pumping it full of steroids in terms of compute, in terms of size of training

37:49.040 --> 37:55.680
 data and the Yann LeCun style self supervised or open AI self supervised. Just throw all of YouTube

37:56.720 --> 38:04.640
 at it and it will learn how to reason, how to paint, how to create music, how to love all that

38:04.640 --> 38:08.960
 by watching YouTube videos. I mean, I can't think of a more terrifying world to live in than a world

38:08.960 --> 38:14.960
 that is based on YouTube videos, but yeah, I think the answer that I just kind of don't think that'll

38:14.960 --> 38:20.320
 quite well, it won't work that easily. You will get somewhere and you will learn something, which

38:20.320 --> 38:25.520
 means it's probably worth it, but you won't get there. You won't solve the problem. Here's the

38:25.520 --> 38:31.600
 thing, we build these things and we say we want them to learn, but what actually happens, and

38:31.600 --> 38:35.600
 let's say they do learn, I mean, certainly every paper I've gotten published, the things learn,

38:35.600 --> 38:40.960
 I don't know about anyone else, but they actually change us, right? We react to it differently,

38:40.960 --> 38:45.600
 right? So we keep redefining what it means to be successful, both in the negative in the case,

38:45.600 --> 38:51.840
 but also in the positive in that, oh, well, this is an accomplishment. I'll give you an example,

38:51.840 --> 38:55.040
 which is like the one you just described with YouTube. Let's get completely out of machine

38:55.040 --> 38:58.000
 learning. Well, not completely, but mostly out of machine learning. Think about Google.

38:59.360 --> 39:03.280
 People were trying to solve information retrieval, the ad hoc information retrieval

39:03.280 --> 39:09.280
 problem forever. I mean, first major book I ever read about it was what, 71, I think it was when

39:09.280 --> 39:14.640
 it came out. Anyway, we'll treat everything as a vector and we'll do these vector space models

39:14.640 --> 39:20.160
 and whatever. And that was all great. And we made very little progress. I mean, we made some progress

39:20.160 --> 39:24.960
 and then Google comes and makes the ad hoc problem seem pretty easy. I mean, it's not,

39:24.960 --> 39:29.920
 there's lots of computers and databases involved, and there's some brilliant algorithmic stuff

39:29.920 --> 39:35.520
 behind it too, and some systems building. But the problem changed, right?

39:37.520 --> 39:42.640
 If you've got a world that's that connected so that you have, you know, there are 10 million

39:42.640 --> 39:48.960
 answers quite literally to the question that you're asking, then the problem wasn't give me

39:48.960 --> 39:52.800
 the things that are relevant. The problem is don't give me anything that's irrelevant, at least in

39:52.800 --> 39:59.120
 the first page, because nothing else matters. So Google is not solving the information retrieval

39:59.120 --> 40:06.560
 problem, at least not on this webpage. Google is minimizing false positives, which is not the same

40:06.560 --> 40:11.120
 thing as getting an answer. It turns out it's good enough for what it is we want to use Google for,

40:11.120 --> 40:15.440
 but it also changes what the problem was we thought we were trying to solve in the first place.

40:15.440 --> 40:18.960
 You thought you were trying to find an answer, but you're not, or you're trying to find the answer,

40:18.960 --> 40:22.480
 but it turns out you're just trying to find an answer. Now, yes, it is true. It's also very good

40:22.480 --> 40:26.480
 at finding you exactly that webpage. Of course, you trained yourself to figure out what the keywords

40:26.480 --> 40:32.640
 were to get you that webpage. But in the end, by having that much data, you've just changed the

40:32.640 --> 40:35.840
 problem into something else. You haven't actually learned what you set out to learn. Now, the

40:35.840 --> 40:40.480
 counter to that would be maybe we're not doing that either. We just think we are because, you know,

40:40.480 --> 40:44.720
 we're in our own heads. Maybe we're learning the wrong problem in the first place, but I don't

40:44.720 --> 40:49.360
 think that matters. I think the point is that Google has not solved information retrieval.

40:49.360 --> 40:53.040
 Google has done amazing service. I have nothing bad to say about what they've done. Lord knows

40:53.040 --> 40:57.440
 my entire life is better because Google exists. For Google Maps, I don't think I've ever found

40:57.440 --> 41:07.360
 this place. Where is this? I see 110 and I see where did 95 go? So I'm very grateful for Google,

41:07.360 --> 41:10.000
 but they just have to make certain the first five things are right.

41:11.040 --> 41:15.600
 And everything after that is wrong. Look, we're going off on a totally different topic here, but

41:17.600 --> 41:21.200
 think about the way we hire faculty. It's exactly the same thing.

41:21.200 --> 41:27.520
 I get in controversial, getting controversial. It's exactly the same problem, right? It's

41:27.520 --> 41:34.880
 minimizing false positives. We say things like we want to find the best person to be an assistant

41:34.880 --> 41:42.160
 professor at MIT in the new college of computing, which I will point out was founded 30 years after

41:42.160 --> 41:49.120
 the college of computing. I'm a part of both of my alma mater. I'm just saying I appreciate all

41:49.120 --> 41:57.760
 that they did and all that they're doing. Anyway, so we're going to try to hire the best professor.

41:57.760 --> 42:01.600
 That's what we say, the best person for this job, but that's not what we do at all, right?

42:02.320 --> 42:07.360
 Do you know which percentage of faculty in the top four earn their PhDs from the top four,

42:08.720 --> 42:12.720
 say in 2017, which is the most recent year for which I have data?

42:12.720 --> 42:14.080
 Maybe a large percentage.

42:14.080 --> 42:15.040
 About 60%.

42:15.040 --> 42:15.600
 60.

42:15.600 --> 42:19.200
 60% of the faculty in the top four earn their PhDs in the top four. This is computer science,

42:19.920 --> 42:23.280
 for which there is no top five. There's only a top four, right? Because they're all tied for one.

42:23.280 --> 42:27.040
 For people who don't know, by the way, that would be MIT Stanford, Berkeley, CMU.

42:27.040 --> 42:27.280
 Yep.

42:29.520 --> 42:31.440
 Georgia Tech is number eight.

42:31.440 --> 42:33.280
 Number eight. You're keeping track.

42:34.080 --> 42:38.240
 Oh yes. It's a large part of my job. Number five is Illinois. Number six is a tie with

42:39.280 --> 42:43.760
 UW and Cornell and Princeton and Georgia Tech are tied for eight and UT Austin is number 10.

42:43.760 --> 42:50.320
 Michigan is number 11, by the way. So if you look at the top 10, you know what percentage of

42:50.320 --> 42:55.760
 faculty in the top 10 earn their PhDs from the top 10? 65, roughly. 65%.

42:56.960 --> 43:03.600
 If you look at the top 55 ranked departments, 50% of the faculty earn their PhDs from the top 10.

43:04.160 --> 43:11.360
 There is no universe in which all the best faculty, even just for R1 universities,

43:11.360 --> 43:16.160
 the majority of them come from 10 places. There's no way that's true, especially when you consider

43:16.160 --> 43:20.000
 how small some of those universities are in terms of the number of PhDs they produce.

43:20.000 --> 43:20.480
 Yeah.

43:20.480 --> 43:24.880
 Now that's not a negative. I mean, it is a negative. It also has a habit of entrenching

43:24.880 --> 43:32.400
 certain historical inequities and accidents. But what it tells you is, well, ask yourself the

43:32.400 --> 43:40.960
 question, why is it like that? Well, because it's easier. If we go all the way back to the 1980s,

43:40.960 --> 43:45.440
 you know, there was a saying that nobody ever lost his job buying a computer from IBM,

43:45.440 --> 43:52.480
 and it was true. And nobody ever lost their job hiring a PhD from MIT, right? If the person turned

43:52.480 --> 43:55.920
 out to be terrible, well, you know, they came from MIT, what did you expect me to know?

43:55.920 --> 44:01.840
 However, that same person coming from pick whichever is your least favorite place that

44:01.840 --> 44:07.280
 produces PhDs in, say, computer science, well, you took a risk, right? So all the incentives,

44:07.280 --> 44:10.320
 particularly because you're only going to hire one this year, well, now we're hiring 10,

44:10.320 --> 44:13.360
 but you know, you're only going to have one or two or three this year. And by the way,

44:13.360 --> 44:16.640
 when they come in, you're stuck with them for at least seven years at most places,

44:16.640 --> 44:19.360
 because that's before you know whether they're getting tenure or not. And if they get tenure,

44:19.360 --> 44:22.880
 stuck with them for a good 30 years, unless they decide to leave. That means the pressure to get

44:22.880 --> 44:27.680
 this right is very high. So what are you going to do? You're going to minimize false positives.

44:27.680 --> 44:33.120
 You don't care about saying no inappropriately. You only care about saying yes inappropriately.

44:33.120 --> 44:36.640
 So all the pressure drives you into that particular direction. Google,

44:36.640 --> 44:41.440
 not to put too fine a point on it, was in exactly the same situation with their search. It turns out

44:41.440 --> 44:46.400
 you just don't want to give people the wrong page in the first three or four pages. And if there's

44:46.400 --> 44:50.400
 10 million right answers and 100 bazillion wrong answers, just make certain the wrong answers

44:50.400 --> 44:55.200
 don't get up there. And who cares if you, the right answer was actually the 13th page. A right

44:55.200 --> 44:59.200
 answer, a satisficing answer is number one, two, three, or four. So who cares?

44:59.200 --> 45:04.160
 Or an answer that will make you discover something beautiful, profound to your question.

45:04.160 --> 45:06.800
 Well, that's a different problem, right?

45:06.800 --> 45:13.920
 But isn't that the problem? Can we linger on this topic without sort of walking with grace?

45:15.040 --> 45:25.600
 How do we get for hiring faculty, how do we get that 13th page with a truly special person? Like

45:25.600 --> 45:29.200
 there's, I mean, it depends on the department. Computer science probably has those department,

45:29.200 --> 45:38.000
 those kinds of people. Like you have the Russian guy, Grigory Perlman, like just these awkward,

45:38.800 --> 45:46.640
 strange minds that don't know how to play the little game of etiquette that faculty have all

45:46.640 --> 45:51.920
 agreed somehow like converged over the decades, how to play with each other. And also is not,

45:51.920 --> 45:58.640
 you know, on top of that is not from the top four, top whatever numbers, the schools. And maybe

45:58.640 --> 46:05.520
 actually just says a few every once in a while to the traditions of old within the computer science

46:05.520 --> 46:11.520
 community. Maybe talks trash about machine learning is a total waste of time. And that's

46:11.520 --> 46:19.440
 there on their resume. So like how do you allow the system to give those folks a chance?

46:19.440 --> 46:22.080
 Well, you have to be willing to take a certain kind of, without taking a particular position

46:22.080 --> 46:26.800
 on any particular person, you'd have to take, you have to be willing to take risk, right? A small

46:26.800 --> 46:31.280
 amount of it. I mean, if we were treating this as a, well, as a machine learning problem, right?

46:31.280 --> 46:34.080
 There's a search problem, which is what it is. It's a search problem. If we were treating it that

46:34.080 --> 46:37.840
 way, you would say, oh, well, the main thing is you want, you know, you've got a prior,

46:37.840 --> 46:41.120
 you want some data because I'm Bayesian. If you don't want to do it that way,

46:41.120 --> 46:46.160
 we'll just inject some randomness in and it'll be okay. The problem is that feels very,

46:46.800 --> 46:53.600
 very hard to do with people. All the incentives are wrong there. But it turns out, and let's say,

46:53.600 --> 46:57.040
 let's say that's the right answer. Let's just give for the sake of argument that, you know,

46:57.040 --> 47:02.560
 injecting randomness in the system at that level for who you hire is just not worth doing because

47:02.560 --> 47:05.600
 the price is too high or the cost is too high. If we had infinite resources, sure, but we don't.

47:05.600 --> 47:09.120
 And also you've got to teach people. So, you know, you're ruining other people's lives if you get it

47:09.120 --> 47:17.120
 too wrong. But we've taken that principle, even if I grant it and pushed it all the way back, right?

47:17.120 --> 47:24.640
 So, we could have a better pool than we have of people we look at and give an opportunity to.

47:25.840 --> 47:29.120
 If we do that, then we have a better chance of finding that. Of course, that just pushes the

47:29.120 --> 47:34.320
 problem back another level. But let me tell you something else. You know, I did a sort of study,

47:34.320 --> 47:37.360
 I call it a study. I called up eight of my friends and asked them for all of their data for

47:37.360 --> 47:41.440
 graduate admissions. But then someone else followed up and did an actual study. And it

47:41.440 --> 47:47.920
 turns out that I can tell you how everybody gets into grad school more or less, more or less.

47:47.920 --> 47:51.520
 You basically admit everyone from places higher ranked than you. You admit most people from

47:51.520 --> 47:54.800
 places ranked around you. And you meant almost no one from places ranked below you, with the

47:54.800 --> 47:58.000
 exception of the small liberal arts colleges that aren't ranked at all, like Harvey Mudd,

47:58.000 --> 48:04.000
 because they don't have a PhD, so they aren't ranked. This is all CS. Which means the decision

48:04.000 --> 48:13.520
 of whether you become a professor at Cornell was determined when you were 17, by what you knew to

48:13.520 --> 48:18.400
 go to undergrad to do whatever. So if we can push these things back a little bit and just make the

48:18.400 --> 48:22.560
 pool a little bit bigger, at least you raise the probability that you will be able to see someone

48:22.560 --> 48:29.120
 interesting and take the risk. The other answer to that question, by the way, which you could argue

48:29.120 --> 48:34.080
 is the same as you either adjust the pool so the probabilities go up, that's a way of injecting a

48:34.080 --> 48:39.120
 little bit of uniform noise in the system, as it were, is you change your loss function.

48:40.080 --> 48:44.640
 You just let yourself be measured by something other than whatever it is that we're measuring

48:44.640 --> 48:50.400
 ourselves by now. I mean, US News and World Report, every time they change their formula

48:50.400 --> 48:55.760
 for determining rankings, move entire universities to behave differently, because rankings matter.

48:55.760 --> 49:01.200
 TITO Can you talk trash about those rankings for a second? No, I'm joking about talking trash.

49:01.200 --> 49:06.560
 I actually, it's so funny how from my perspective, from a very shallow perspective,

49:07.280 --> 49:13.200
 how dogmatic, like how much I trust those rankings. They're almost ingrained in my head.

49:13.920 --> 49:21.600
 I mean, at MIT, everybody kind of, it's a propagated, mutually agreed upon

49:21.600 --> 49:26.400
 TITO idea that those rankings matter. And I don't think anyone knows what they're,

49:26.960 --> 49:33.280
 like, most people don't know what they're based on. And what are they exactly based on? And what

49:33.280 --> 49:38.160
 are the flaws in that? TITO Well, so it depends on which rankings you're talking about. Do you

49:38.160 --> 49:41.680
 want to talk about computer science or talk about universities? TITO Computer science, US News,

49:42.320 --> 49:46.400
 isn't that the main one? TITO Yeah, the only one that matters is US News. Nothing else matters.

49:46.400 --> 49:52.960
 Sorry, CSRankings.org, but nothing else matters but US News. So US News has formula that it uses

49:52.960 --> 49:57.440
 for many things, but not for computer science because computer science is considered a science,

49:57.440 --> 50:05.680
 which is absurd. So the rankings for computer science is 100% reputation. So two people

50:06.640 --> 50:11.040
 at each department, it's not really department, whatever, at each department,

50:11.040 --> 50:16.880
 basically rank everybody. Slightly more complicated than that, but whatever, they rank everyone. And

50:16.880 --> 50:22.000
 then those things are put together and somehow. TITO So that means how do you improve reputation?

50:22.000 --> 50:26.960
 How do you move up and down the space of reputation? TITO Yes, that's exactly the

50:26.960 --> 50:31.760
 question. TITO Twitter? TITO It can help. I can tell you how Georgia Tech did it,

50:31.760 --> 50:35.520
 or at least how I think Georgia Tech did it, because Georgia Tech is actually the case to

50:35.520 --> 50:40.240
 look at. Not just because I'm at Georgia Tech, but because Georgia Tech is the only computing unit

50:40.240 --> 50:44.560
 that was not in the top 20 that has made it into the top 10. It's also the only one in the last

50:45.280 --> 50:53.040
 two decades, I think, that moved up in the top 10, as opposed to having someone else moved down.

50:53.040 --> 50:58.320
 So we used to be number 10, and then we became number nine because UT Austin went down slightly,

50:58.320 --> 51:02.960
 and now we were tied for ninth because that's how rankings work. And we moved from nine to eight

51:02.960 --> 51:10.320
 because our raw score moved up a point. So something about Georgia Tech, computer science,

51:10.320 --> 51:17.120
 or computing anyway. I think it's because we have shown leadership at every crisis level, right? So

51:17.120 --> 51:21.040
 we created a college, first public university to do it, second college, second university to do it

51:21.040 --> 51:26.400
 after CMU is number one. I also think it's no accident that CMU is the largest and we're,

51:26.400 --> 51:30.320
 depending upon how you count and depending on exactly where MIT ends up with its final college

51:30.320 --> 51:33.360
 of computing, second or third largest. I don't think that's an accident. We've been doing this

51:33.360 --> 51:38.320
 for a long time. But in the 2000s when there was a crisis about undergraduate education,

51:39.440 --> 51:44.080
 Georgia Tech took a big risk and succeeded at rethinking undergrad education and computing.

51:45.040 --> 51:49.920
 I think we created these schools at a time when most public universities anyway were afraid to

51:49.920 --> 51:56.000
 do it. We did the online masters and that mattered because people were trying to figure out what to

51:56.000 --> 52:02.400
 do with MOOCs and so on. I think it's about being observed by your peers and having an impact. So,

52:02.400 --> 52:07.520
 I mean, that is what reputation is, right? So the way you move up in the reputation rankings is by

52:07.520 --> 52:12.320
 doing something that makes people turn and look at you and say, that's good. They're better than I

52:12.320 --> 52:17.440
 thought. Beyond that, it's just inertia and there's huge hysteresis in the system, right? I mean,

52:17.440 --> 52:23.120
 there was these, I can't remember this, this may be apocryphal, but there's a major or department

52:23.120 --> 52:28.640
 that MIT was ranked number one in and they didn't have it. It's just about what you... I don't know

52:28.640 --> 52:33.360
 if that's true, but someone said that to me anyway. But it's a thing, right? It's all about

52:33.360 --> 52:37.280
 reputation. Of course, MIT is great because MIT is great. It's always been great. By the way,

52:37.280 --> 52:42.960
 because MIT is great, the best students come, which keeps it being great. I mean,

52:42.960 --> 52:46.560
 it's just a positive feedback loop. It's not surprising. I don't think it's wrong.

52:46.560 --> 52:53.360
 Yeah. But it's almost like a narrative. It doesn't actually have to be backed by reality. Not to

52:53.360 --> 53:01.040
 say anything about MIT, but it does feel like we're playing in the space of narratives, not the

53:01.040 --> 53:06.880
 space of something grounded. One of the surprising things when I showed up at MIT and just all the

53:06.880 --> 53:14.880
 students I've worked with and all the research I've done is they're the same people as I've met

53:14.880 --> 53:21.520
 at other places. I mean, what MIT has going for it... Well, MIT has many things going for it. One

53:21.520 --> 53:23.840
 of the things MIT has going for it is... Nice logo?

53:23.840 --> 53:29.520
 Is nice logo. It's a lot better than it was when I was here. Nice colors too. Terrible,

53:30.080 --> 53:35.760
 terrible name for a mascot. But the thing that MIT has going for it is it really does get the

53:35.760 --> 53:40.400
 best students. It just doesn't get all of the best students. There are many more best students out

53:40.400 --> 53:45.040
 there. And the best students want to be here because it's the best place to be or one of the

53:45.040 --> 53:48.880
 best places to be. And it's a sort of positive feedback. But you said something earlier,

53:50.240 --> 53:54.960
 which I think is worth examining for a moment. I forget the word you used. You said,

53:56.240 --> 54:00.000
 we're living in the space of narrative as opposed to something objective.

54:00.000 --> 54:04.320
 Narrative is objective. I mean, one could argue that the only thing that we do as humans is

54:04.320 --> 54:08.720
 narrative. We just build stories to explain why we do what we do. Someone once asked me,

54:08.720 --> 54:12.800
 but wait, there's nothing objective. No, it's completely an objective measure.

54:12.800 --> 54:19.600
 It's an objective measure of the opinions of everybody else. Now, is that physics? I don't

54:19.600 --> 54:25.280
 know. Tell me something you think is actually objective and measurable in a way that makes

54:25.280 --> 54:31.840
 sense. Cameras, they don't... You're getting me off on something here, but do you know that

54:31.840 --> 54:39.440
 cameras, which are just reflecting light and putting them on film, did not work for dark

54:39.440 --> 54:45.840
 skin people until the 1970s? You know why? Because you were building cameras for the people who were

54:45.840 --> 54:51.200
 going to buy cameras, who all, at least in the United States and Western Europe, were relatively

54:51.200 --> 54:56.560
 light skin. Turns out it took terrible pictures of people who look like me. That got fixed with

54:56.560 --> 55:03.440
 better film and whole processes. Do you know why? Because furniture manufacturers wanted to be able

55:03.440 --> 55:10.080
 to take pictures of mahogany furniture, right? Because candy manufacturers wanted to be able

55:10.080 --> 55:16.480
 to take pictures of chocolate. Now, the reason I bring that up is because you might think that

55:16.480 --> 55:23.200
 cameras are objective. They're just capturing light. No, they're doing the things that they're

55:23.200 --> 55:29.200
 doing based upon decisions by real human beings to privilege, if I may use that word, some physics

55:29.200 --> 55:33.280
 over others, because it's an engineering problem. There are tradeoffs, right? So I can either worry

55:33.280 --> 55:37.200
 about this part of the spectrum or this part of the spectrum. This costs more. That costs less.

55:37.200 --> 55:41.600
 This costs the same, but I have more people paying money over here, right? And it turns out that

55:41.600 --> 55:46.640
 if a giant conglomerate demands that you do something different and it's going to involve

55:46.640 --> 55:51.200
 all kinds of money for you, suddenly the tradeoffs change, right? And so there you go. I actually

55:51.200 --> 55:55.760
 don't know how I ended up there. Oh, it's because of this notion of objectiveness, right? So even

55:55.760 --> 55:58.800
 the objective isn't objective because at the end you've got to tell a story. You've got to make

55:58.800 --> 56:03.120
 decisions. You've got to make tradeoff. What else is engineering other than that? So I think that

56:03.120 --> 56:09.120
 the rankings capture something. They just don't necessarily capture what people assume they

56:09.120 --> 56:19.920
 capture. You know, just to linger on this idea, why is there not more people who just like play

56:19.920 --> 56:24.400
 with whatever that narrative is, have fun with it, have like excite the world, whether it's in

56:24.400 --> 56:31.600
 the Carl Sagan style of like that calm, sexy voice of explaining the stars and all the romantic stuff

56:31.600 --> 56:37.040
 or the Elon Musk, dare I even say Donald Trump, where you're like trolling and shaking up the

56:37.040 --> 56:43.920
 system and just saying controversial things. I talked to Lisa Feldman Barrett, who's a

56:43.920 --> 56:50.320
 neuroscientist who just enjoys playing the controversy. Things like finds the counter

56:50.320 --> 56:56.080
 intuitive ideas in the particular science and throws them out there and sees how they play in

56:56.080 --> 57:02.400
 the public discourse. Like why don't we see more of that? And why doesn't academia attract an Elon

57:02.400 --> 57:08.480
 Musk type? Well, tenure is a powerful thing that allows you to do whatever you want, but getting

57:08.480 --> 57:14.240
 tenure typically requires you to be relatively narrow, right? Because people are judging you.

57:14.240 --> 57:22.000
 Well, I think the answer is we have told ourselves a story, a narrative that is vulgar,

57:22.000 --> 57:30.880
 what you just described is vulgar. It's certainly unscientific, right? And it is easy to convince

57:30.880 --> 57:37.360
 yourself that in some ways you're the mathematician, right? The fewer there are in your major,

57:37.360 --> 57:45.040
 the more that proves your purity, right? So once you tell yourself that story, then it is

57:46.240 --> 57:51.840
 beneath you to do that kind of thing, right? I think that's wrong. I think that, and by the way,

57:51.840 --> 57:54.320
 everyone doesn't have to do this. Everyone's not good at it. And everyone, even if they would be

57:54.320 --> 58:00.080
 good at it, would enjoy it. So it's fine. But I do think you need some diversity in the way that

58:00.080 --> 58:09.440
 people choose to relate to the world as academics, because I think the great universities are ones

58:09.440 --> 58:15.760
 that engage with the rest of the world. It is a home for public intellectuals. And in 2020,

58:15.760 --> 58:21.520
 being a public intellectual probably means being on Twitter. Whereas of course that wasn't true

58:21.520 --> 58:25.280
 20 years ago, because Twitter wasn't around 20 years ago. And if it was, it wasn't around in a

58:25.280 --> 58:28.960
 meaningful way. I don't actually know how long Twitter has been around. As I get older, I find

58:28.960 --> 58:33.840
 that my notion of time has gotten worse and worse. Like Google really has been around that long?

58:33.840 --> 58:43.360
 Anyway, the point is that I think that we sometimes forget that a part of our job is to

58:43.360 --> 58:47.040
 impact the people who aren't in the world that we're in, and that that's the point of being at

58:47.040 --> 58:51.520
 a great place and being a great person, frankly. There's an interesting force in terms of public

58:51.520 --> 58:57.120
 intellectuals. Forget Twitter, we could look at just online courses that are public facing in

58:57.120 --> 59:06.960
 some part. There is a kind of force that pulls you back. Let me just call it out because I don't

59:06.960 --> 59:12.000
 give a damn at this point. There's a little bit of, all of us have this, but certainly faculty

59:12.000 --> 59:20.480
 have this, which is jealousy. Whoever's popular at being a good communicator, exciting the world

59:20.480 --> 59:27.280
 with their science. And of course, when you excite the world with the science, it's not

59:27.280 --> 59:36.160
 peer reviewed, clean. It all sounds like bullshit. It's like a Ted talk and people roll their eyes

59:36.160 --> 59:41.360
 and they hate that a Ted talk gets millions of views or something like that. And then everybody

59:41.360 --> 59:46.400
 pulls each other back. There's this force that just kind of, it's hard to stand out unless you

59:46.400 --> 59:53.200
 win a Nobel prize or whatever. It's only when you get senior enough where you just stop giving a

59:53.200 --> 59:58.160
 damn. But just like you said, even when you get tenure, that was always the surprising thing to

59:58.160 --> 1:00:05.120
 me. I have many colleagues and friends who have gotten tenure, but there's not a switch.

1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:13.520
 There's not an F you money switch where you're like, you know what? Now I'm going to be more

1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:18.880
 bold. It doesn't, I don't see it. Well, there's a reason for that. Tenure isn't a test. It's a

1:00:18.880 --> 1:00:24.240
 training process. It teaches you to behave in a certain way, to think in a certain way, to accept

1:00:24.240 --> 1:00:28.880
 certain values and to react accordingly. And the better you are at that, the more likely you are to

1:00:28.880 --> 1:00:34.720
 earn tenure. And by the way, this is not a bad thing. Most things are like that. And I think most

1:00:34.720 --> 1:00:38.880
 of my colleagues are interested in doing great work and they're just having impact in the way that

1:00:38.880 --> 1:00:45.760
 they want to have impact. I do think that as a field, not just as a field, as a profession,

1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:56.000
 we have a habit of belittling those who are popular as it were, as if the word itself is a

1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:06.720
 kind of Scarlet A, right? I think it's easy to convince yourself, and no one is immune to this,

1:01:06.720 --> 1:01:10.880
 no one is immune to this, that the people who are better known are better known for bad reasons.

1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:18.720
 The people who are out there dumbing it down are not being pure to whatever the values and ethos

1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:25.600
 is for your field. And it's just very easy to do. Now, having said that, I think that ultimately,

1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:31.920
 people who are able to be popular and out there and are touching the world and making a difference,

1:01:31.920 --> 1:01:36.800
 you know, our colleagues do, in fact, appreciate that in the long run. It's just, you know,

1:01:36.800 --> 1:01:40.960
 you have to be very good at it or you have to be very interested in pursuing it. And once you get

1:01:40.960 --> 1:01:45.200
 past a certain level, I think people accept that for who it is. I mean, I don't know. I'd be really

1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:50.000
 interested in how Rod Brooks felt about how people were interacting with him when he did Fast,

1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:53.120
 Cheap, and Out of Control way, way, way back when.

1:01:53.120 --> 1:01:55.200
 What's Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control?

1:01:55.200 --> 1:02:00.480
 It was a documentary that involved four people. I remember nothing about it other than Rod Brooks

1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:05.200
 was in it and something about naked mole rats. I can't remember what the other two things were.

1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:07.440
 It was robots, naked mole rats, and then two others.

1:02:07.440 --> 1:02:11.920
 By the way, Rod Brooks used to be the head of the artificial intelligence laboratory at MIT

1:02:12.480 --> 1:02:18.160
 and then launched, I think, iRobot and then Think Robotics, Rethink Robotics.

1:02:18.160 --> 1:02:18.720
 Yes.

1:02:18.720 --> 1:02:27.200
 Think is in the word. And also is a little bit of a rock star personality in the AI world,

1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:32.480
 a very opinionated, very intelligent. Anyway, sorry, mole rats and naked.

1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:36.080
 Naked mole rats. Also, he was one of my two advisors for my PhD.

1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:37.840
 This explains a lot.

1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:43.840
 I don't know how to explain it. I love Rod. But I also love my other advisor, Paul. Paul,

1:02:43.840 --> 1:02:46.080
 if you're listening, I love you too. Both very, very different people.

1:02:46.080 --> 1:02:46.640
 Paul Viola.

1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:51.360
 Paul Viola. Both very interesting people, very different in many ways. But I don't know what

1:02:51.360 --> 1:02:56.800
 Rod would say to you about what the reaction was. I know that for the students at the time,

1:02:56.800 --> 1:03:03.680
 because I was a student at the time, it was amazing. This guy was in a movie, being very

1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:10.720
 much himself. Actually, the movie version of him is a little bit more Rod than Rod. I think they

1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:15.200
 edited it appropriately for him. But it was very much Rod. And he did all this while doing great

1:03:15.200 --> 1:03:18.720
 work. Was he running the iLab at that point or not? I don't know. But anyway, he was running

1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:23.280
 the iLab, or would be soon. He was a giant in the field. He did amazing things, made a lot of his

1:03:23.280 --> 1:03:28.960
 bones by doing the kind of counterintuitive science. And saying, no, you're doing this all

1:03:28.960 --> 1:03:32.720
 wrong. Representation is crazy. The world is your own representation. You just react to it. I mean,

1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:37.760
 these are amazing things. And continues to do those sorts of things as he's moved on.

1:03:37.760 --> 1:03:43.280
 I think he might tell you, I don't know if he would tell you it was good or bad, but I know that

1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:46.880
 for everyone else out there in the world, it was a good thing. And certainly,

1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:50.560
 he continued to be respected. So it's not as if it destroyed his career by being popular.

1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:24.960
 P stands for probabilistic. And what does

1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:31.440
 FUNC stand for? So a lot of my life is about making acronyms. So if I have one quirk,

1:04:31.440 --> 1:04:36.880
 it's that people will say words and I see if they make acronyms. And if they do, then I'm happy. And

1:04:36.880 --> 1:04:40.560
 then if they don't, I try to change it so that they make acronyms. It's just a thing that I do.

1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:46.960
 So PFUNC is an acronym. It has three or four different meanings. But finally, I decided that

1:04:46.960 --> 1:05:13.840
 the P stands for probabilistic because at the end of the day, it's machine learning and it's randomness and

1:05:13.840 --> 1:05:40.720
 it's fun.

1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:43.760
 So there's a sense to it, which is not an acronym, like literally FUNC. You have a dark, mysterious past.

1:05:43.760 --> 1:06:13.680
 So there's a sense to it, which is not an acronym, like literally FUNC.

1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:43.600
 There's a sense to it, which is not an acronym, like literally FUNC.

1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:48.480
 It's a whole set of things of which rap is a part. So tagging is a part of hip hop. I don't know why

1:06:48.480 --> 1:06:51.680
 that's true, but people tell me it's true and I'm willing to go along with it because they get very

1:06:51.680 --> 1:06:56.400
 angry about it. But hip hop is like graffiti. Tagging is like graffiti. And there's all these,

1:06:56.400 --> 1:06:59.600
 including the popping and the locking and all the dancing and all those things. That's all a part of

1:06:59.600 --> 1:07:04.320
 hip hop. It's a way of life, which I think is true. And then there's rap, which is this particular.

1:07:04.960 --> 1:07:05.840
 It's the music part.

1:07:05.840 --> 1:07:12.560
 Yes. A music part. I mean, you wouldn't call the stuff that DJs do the scratching. That's not rap,

1:07:12.560 --> 1:07:16.640
 right? But it's a part of hip hop, right? So given that we understand that hip hop is this whole

1:07:16.640 --> 1:07:21.840
 thing, what are the rap albums that best touch that for me? Well, if I were going to educate you,

1:07:21.840 --> 1:07:24.080
 I would try to figure out what you liked and then I would work you there.

1:07:26.400 --> 1:07:38.400
 Oh my God. I would probably start with, there's a fascinating exercise one can do by watching old

1:07:38.400 --> 1:07:43.680
 episodes of I love the seventies. I love the eighties. I love the nineties with a bunch of

1:07:43.680 --> 1:07:48.480
 friends and just see where people come in and out of pop culture. So if you're talking about

1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:54.960
 those people, then I would actually start you with where I would hope to start you with anyway,

1:07:54.960 --> 1:08:00.480
 which is public enemy. Particularly it takes a nation of millions to hold us back, which is

1:08:00.480 --> 1:08:05.440
 clearly the best album ever produced. And certainly the best hip hop album ever produced

1:08:05.440 --> 1:08:11.040
 in part because it was so much of what was great about the time. Fantastic lyrics is me. It's all

1:08:11.040 --> 1:08:16.160
 about the lyrics. Amazing music that was coming from Rick Rubin was the producer of that. And he

1:08:16.160 --> 1:08:21.680
 did a lot, very kind of heavy mental ish, at least in the eighties sense at the time. And it was

1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:28.160
 focused on politics in the 1980s, which was what made hip hop so great. Then I would start you

1:08:28.160 --> 1:08:33.040
 there. Then I would move you up through things that are been happening more recently. I'd probably

1:08:33.040 --> 1:08:37.280
 get you to someone like a most deaf. I would give you a history lesson, basically. Most of them.

1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:41.440
 That's amazing. He hosted a poetry jam thing on HBO or something like that. Probably. I don't

1:08:41.440 --> 1:08:46.000
 think I've seen it, but I wouldn't be surprised. Yeah. Spoken poetry. That's amazing. He's amazing.

1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:50.080
 And then I would, I, after I got you there, I'd work you back to EPMD.

1:08:51.520 --> 1:08:57.200
 And eventually I would take you back to the last poets and particularly the first album,

1:08:57.200 --> 1:09:02.720
 the last poets, which was 1970 to give you a sense of history and that it actually has been building

1:09:02.720 --> 1:09:08.480
 up over a very, very long time. So we would start there because that's where your music aligns. And

1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:12.480
 then we would cycle out and I'd move you to the present. And then I'd take you back to the past.

1:09:12.480 --> 1:09:15.920
 Because I think a large part of people who are kind of confused about any kind of music,

1:09:16.880 --> 1:09:19.680
 you know, the truth is this is the same thing we've always been talking about, right? It's

1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:23.520
 about narrative and being a part of something and being immersed in something. So you understand it,

1:09:23.520 --> 1:09:30.160
 right? Jazz, which I also like is one of the things that's cool about jazz is that you come

1:09:30.160 --> 1:09:32.960
 and you meet someone who's talking to you about jazz and you have no idea what they're talking

1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:37.200
 about. And then one day it all clicks and you've been so immersed in it. You go, oh yeah, that's a

1:09:37.200 --> 1:09:41.440
 Charlie Parker. You start using words that nobody else understands, right? And it becomes part of

1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:45.200
 hip hop's the same way. Everything's the same way. They're all cultural artifacts, but I would help

1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:49.120
 you to see that there's a history of it and how it connects to other genres of music that you might

1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:54.320
 like to bring you in. So that you could kind of see how it connects to what you already like,

1:09:54.320 --> 1:10:00.960
 including some of the good work that's been done with fusions of hip hop and bluegrass.

1:10:02.480 --> 1:10:03.200
 Oh no.

1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:09.520
 Yes. Some of it's even good. Not all of it, but some of it is good,

1:10:09.520 --> 1:10:12.320
 but I'd start you with, it takes a nation of millions to hold this back.

1:10:12.320 --> 1:10:18.800
 There's an interesting tradition in like more modern hip hop of integrating almost like classic

1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:25.440
 crock songs or whatever, like integrating into their music, into the beat, into the whatever.

1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:31.040
 It's kind of interesting. It gives a whole new, not just classic crock, but what is it?

1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:33.120
 Kanye with Gold Digger.

1:10:33.120 --> 1:10:35.680
 Old R&B.

1:10:35.680 --> 1:10:38.080
 It's taking and pulling old R&B, right?

1:10:38.080 --> 1:10:41.200
 Well, that's been true since the beginning. I mean, in fact, that's in some ways,

1:10:41.200 --> 1:10:47.600
 that's why the DJ used to get top billing because it was the DJ that brought all the records together

1:10:47.600 --> 1:10:52.800
 and made it worth so that people could dance. You go back to those days, mostly in New York,

1:10:52.800 --> 1:10:55.360
 though not exclusively, but mostly in New York where it sort of came out of,

1:10:56.400 --> 1:11:00.240
 the DJ that brought all the music together and the beats and showed that basically music is

1:11:00.240 --> 1:11:04.480
 itself an instrument, very meta, and you can bring it together and then you sort of wrap over it and

1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:10.000
 so on. And it moved that way. So that's going way, way back. Now, in the period of time where I grew

1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:17.200
 up, when I became really into it, which was mostly the 80s, it was more funk was the back for a lot

1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:22.800
 of the stuff, Public Enemy at that time, notwithstanding. And so, which is very nice

1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:26.720
 because it tied into what my parents listened to and what I vaguely remember listening to when I

1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:33.120
 was very small. And by the way, complete revival of George Clinton and Parliament and Funkadelic

1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:38.000
 and all of those things to bring it sort of back into the 80s and into the 90s. And as we go on,

1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:42.240
 you're going to see the last decade and the decade before that being brought in.

1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:45.600
 And when you don't think that you're hearing something you've heard, it's probably because

1:11:45.600 --> 1:11:53.920
 it's being sampled by someone who, referring to something they remembered when they were young,

1:11:53.920 --> 1:11:59.040
 perhaps from somewhere else altogether. And you just didn't realize what it was because it wasn't

1:11:59.040 --> 1:12:02.160
 a popular song where you happened to grow up. So this stuff has been going on for a long time.

1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:08.480
 It's one of the things that I think is beautiful. Run DMC, Jam Master Jay used to play, he played

1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:13.200
 piano. He would record himself playing piano and then sample that to make it a part of what was

1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:17.600
 going on rather than play the piano. That's how his mind can think. Well, it's pieces. You're

1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:20.480
 putting pieces together, you're putting pieces of music together to create new music, right?

1:12:20.480 --> 1:12:22.880
 Now that doesn't mean that the root, I mean, the roots are doing their own thing.

1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:30.240
 Yeah. Right. Those, those are, that's a whole. Yeah. But still it's the right attitude that,

1:12:30.240 --> 1:12:33.280
 you know, and what else is jazz, right? Jazz is about putting pieces together and then putting

1:12:33.280 --> 1:12:36.640
 your own spin on it. It's all the same. It's all the same thing. It's all the same thing.

1:12:36.640 --> 1:12:41.600
 Yeah. Cause you mentioned lyrics. It does make me sad. Again, this is me talking trash about

1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:46.880
 modern hip hop. I haven't, you know, investigated. I'm sure people correct me that there's a lot of

1:12:46.880 --> 1:12:50.640
 great artists. That's part of the reason I'm saying it is they'll leave it in the comments that you

1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:59.680
 should listen to this person is the lyrics went away from talking about maybe not just politics,

1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:04.720
 but life and so on. Like, you know, the kind of like protest songs, even if you look at like a

1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:09.040
 Bob Marley or you said Public Enemy or Rage Against the Machine, More on the Rockside,

1:13:09.040 --> 1:13:16.080
 there's, that's the place where we go to those lyrics. Like classic rock is all about like,

1:13:16.800 --> 1:13:23.360
 my woman left me or, or I'm really happy that she's still with me or the flip side. It's like

1:13:23.360 --> 1:13:27.920
 love songs of different kinds. It's all love, but it's less political, like less interesting. I

1:13:27.920 --> 1:13:34.320
 would say in terms of like deep, profound knowledge. And it seems like rap is the place where you

1:13:34.320 --> 1:13:40.160
 would find that. And it's sad that for the most part, what I see, like you look like mumble rap

1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:45.120
 or whatever, they're moving away from lyrics and more towards the beat and the, and the musicality

1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:49.120
 of it. I've always been a fan of the lyrics. In fact, if you go back and you read my reviews,

1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:57.120
 which I recently was rereading, man, I wrote my last review the month I graduated. I got my PhD,

1:13:57.120 --> 1:14:01.120
 which says something about something. I'm not sure what though. I always would always,

1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:04.560
 but I often would start with, it's all about the lyrics. For me, it's all, it's about the lyrics.

1:14:06.560 --> 1:14:10.000
 Someone has already written in the comments before I've even finished having this conversation

1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:13.600
 that, you know, neither of us knows what we're talking about and it's all in the underground

1:14:13.600 --> 1:14:19.040
 hip hop and here's who you should go listen to. And that is true. Every time I despair for popular

1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:25.360
 rap, I get someone points me to, or I discover some underground hip hop song and I'm, I am made

1:14:25.360 --> 1:14:30.720
 happy and whole again. So I know it's out there. I don't listen to as much as I used to because

1:14:30.720 --> 1:14:37.040
 I'm listening to podcasts and old music from the 1980s. It's a kind of no beat at all, but you know,

1:14:37.040 --> 1:14:42.480
 there's a little bit of sampling here and there. I'm sure. By the way, James Brown is funk or no?

1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:48.560
 Yes. And so is junior Wells, by the way. Who's that? Oh, junior Wells, Chicago blues. He was

1:14:48.560 --> 1:14:53.440
 James Brown before James Brown was. It's hard to imagine somebody being James Brown. Go look up

1:14:53.440 --> 1:15:01.920
 hoodoo man blues, junior Wells, and just listen to, snatch it back and hold it and you'll see it.

1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:06.080
 And they were contemporaries. Where do you put like little Richard or all that kind of stuff?

1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:12.160
 Like Ray Charles, like when they get like, hit the road Jack and don't you come back. Isn't that

1:15:12.160 --> 1:15:16.160
 like, there's a funkiness in it. Oh, that's definitely a funkiness in it. I mean, it's all,

1:15:16.160 --> 1:15:20.320
 I mean, it's all, it's all a line. I mean, it's all, there's all a line that carries it all

1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:24.240
 together. You know, it's, I guess I would answer your question, depending on whether I'm thinking

1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:28.800
 about it in 2020 or I'm thinking about it in 1960. Um, I'd probably give a different answer.

1:15:28.800 --> 1:15:32.800
 I'm just thinking in terms of, you know, that was rock, but when you look back on it, it's,

1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:38.240
 it was funky, but we didn't use those words or maybe we did. I wasn't around. Uh, but you know,

1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:42.320
 I don't think we used the word 1960 funk, certainly not the way we used it in the seventies

1:15:42.320 --> 1:15:47.120
 and the eighties. Do you reject disco? I do not reject disco. I appreciate all the mistakes that

1:15:47.120 --> 1:15:52.320
 we have made. Actually, some of the disco is actually really, really good. John Travolta.

1:15:52.320 --> 1:15:56.720
 Oh boy. He regrets it probably. Maybe not. Well, like it's the mistakes thing.

1:15:56.720 --> 1:15:58.880
 Yeah. And it got him to where he's going, where he is.

1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:05.920
 Oh, well, thank you for taking that detour. You've, you've talked about computing. We've

1:16:05.920 --> 1:16:11.600
 already talked about computing a little bit, but can you try to describe how you think about the

1:16:11.600 --> 1:16:16.880
 world of computing or it fits into the sets of different disciplines? We mentioned College of

1:16:16.880 --> 1:16:22.560
 Computing. What, what should people, how should they think about computing, especially from an

1:16:22.560 --> 1:16:30.800
 educational perspective of like, what is the perfect curriculum that defines for a young mind,

1:16:30.800 --> 1:16:34.960
 uh, what computing is? So I don't know about a perfect curriculum, although that's an important

1:16:34.960 --> 1:16:39.280
 question because at the end of the day, without the curriculum, you don't get anywhere. Curriculum

1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:44.080
 to me is the fundamental data structure. It's not even the classroom. I mean, the world is,

1:16:44.080 --> 1:16:49.200
 right? I, I, I, so I think the curriculum is where I like to play. Uh, so I spend a lot of time

1:16:49.200 --> 1:16:52.400
 thinking about this, but I will tell you, I'll answer your question by answering a slightly

1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:55.520
 different question first and then getting back to this, which is, you know, you talked about

1:16:55.520 --> 1:17:01.120
 disciplines and what does it mean to be a discipline? The truth is what we really educate

1:17:01.120 --> 1:17:05.520
 people in from the beginning, but certainly through college, you sort of failed. If you

1:17:05.520 --> 1:17:12.640
 don't think about it this way, I think is the world. People often think about tools and tool

1:17:12.640 --> 1:17:16.560
 sets, and when you're really trying to be good, you think about skills and skill sets,

1:17:16.560 --> 1:17:22.400
 but disciplines are about mindsets, right? They're about fundamental ways of thinking, not just the,

1:17:22.400 --> 1:17:27.280
 the, the hammer that you pick up, whatever that is to hit the nail, um, not just the,

1:17:27.280 --> 1:17:30.960
 the skill of learning how to hammer well or whatever. It's the mindset of like,

1:17:30.960 --> 1:17:37.200
 what's the fundamental way to think about, to think about the world, right? And disciplines,

1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:40.960
 different disciplines give you different mindsets to give you different ways of sort of thinking

1:17:40.960 --> 1:17:45.680
 through. So with that in mind, I think that computing, even ask the question, whether

1:17:45.680 --> 1:17:48.960
 it's a discipline that you have to decide, does it have a mindset? Does it have a way of thinking

1:17:48.960 --> 1:17:53.600
 about the world that is different from, you know, the scientist who is doing a discovery and using

1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:57.680
 the scientific method as a way of doing it, or the mathematician who builds abstractions and tries

1:17:57.680 --> 1:18:03.040
 to find sort of steady state truth about the abstractions that may be artificial, but whatever,

1:18:03.600 --> 1:18:08.560
 or is it the engineer who's all about, you know, building demonstrably superior technology with

1:18:08.560 --> 1:18:12.640
 respect to some notion of trade offs, whatever that means, right? That's sort of the world that

1:18:12.640 --> 1:18:16.880
 you, the world that you live in. What is computing? You know, how is computing different? So I've

1:18:16.880 --> 1:18:22.160
 thought about this for a long time and I've come to a view about what computing actually is, what

1:18:22.160 --> 1:18:26.320
 the mindset is. And, and it's, you know, it's a little abstract, but that would be appropriate

1:18:26.320 --> 1:18:34.320
 for computing. I think that what distinguishes the computationalist from others is that he or

1:18:34.320 --> 1:18:41.600
 she understands that models, languages and machines are equivalent. They're the same thing. And

1:18:41.600 --> 1:18:47.440
 because it's not just a model, but it's a machine that is an executable thing that can be described

1:18:47.440 --> 1:18:54.000
 as a language. That means that it's dynamic. So it's not the, it is mathematical in some sense,

1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:58.320
 in the kind of sense of abstraction, but it is fundamentally dynamic and executable. The

1:18:58.320 --> 1:19:03.280
 mathematician is not necessarily worried about either the dynamic part. In fact, whenever I tried

1:19:03.280 --> 1:19:08.160
 to write something for mathematicians, they invariably demand that I make it static. And

1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:12.560
 that's not a bad thing. It's just, it's a way of viewing the world that truth is a thing, right?

1:19:12.560 --> 1:19:19.440
 It's not a process that continually runs, right? So that dynamic thing matters. That self reflection

1:19:19.440 --> 1:19:23.280
 of the system itself matters. And that is what computing, that is what computing brought us.

1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:27.840
 So it is a science because it, the models fundamentally represent truths in the world.

1:19:27.840 --> 1:19:33.040
 Information is a scientific thing to discover, right? Not just a mathematical conceit that

1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:37.040
 that gets created. But of course it's engineering because you're actually dealing with constraints

1:19:37.040 --> 1:19:43.120
 in the world and trying to execute machines that actually run. But it's also a math because

1:19:43.120 --> 1:19:48.080
 you're actually worrying about these languages that describe what's happening. But the fact that

1:19:51.440 --> 1:19:56.400
 regular expressions and finite state automata, one of which feels like a machine or at least

1:19:56.400 --> 1:19:59.760
 an abstraction machine and the other is a language that they're actually the equivalent thing. I mean,

1:19:59.760 --> 1:20:03.840
 that is not a small thing and it permeates everything that we do, even when we're just

1:20:03.840 --> 1:20:09.120
 trying to figure out how to, how to do debugging. So that idea I think is fundamental and we would

1:20:09.120 --> 1:20:14.400
 do better if we made that more explicit. How my life has changed and my thinking about this

1:20:15.200 --> 1:20:20.880
 in the 10 or 15 years it's been since I tried to put that to paper with some colleagues is

1:20:21.680 --> 1:20:28.000
 the realization, which comes to a question you actually asked me earlier, which has to do with

1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:32.400
 trees falling down and whether it matters, is this sort of triangle of equality.

1:20:34.560 --> 1:20:40.720
 It only matters because there's a person inside the triangle, right? That what's changed about

1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:45.680
 computing, computer science or whatever you want to call it, is we now have so much data

1:20:46.560 --> 1:20:51.680
 and so much computational power. We're able to do really, really interesting, promising things.

1:20:53.040 --> 1:20:56.960
 But the interesting and the promising kind of only matters with respect to human beings and

1:20:56.960 --> 1:21:01.680
 their relationship to it. So the triangle exists, that is fundamentally computing.

1:21:01.680 --> 1:21:08.880
 What makes it worthwhile and interesting and potentially world species changing is that there

1:21:08.880 --> 1:21:12.640
 are human beings inside of it and intelligence that has to interact with it to change the data,

1:21:12.640 --> 1:21:19.120
 the information that makes sense and gives meaning to the models, the languages and the machines.

1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:25.120
 So if the curriculum can convey that while conveying the tools and the skills that you need

1:21:25.120 --> 1:21:29.680
 in order to succeed, then it is a big win. That's what I think you have to do.

1:21:30.880 --> 1:21:36.960
 Do you pull psychology, like these human things into that, into the idea,

1:21:36.960 --> 1:21:41.120
 into this framework of computing? Do you pull in psychology and neuroscience,

1:21:41.120 --> 1:21:44.560
 like parts of psychology, parts of neuroscience, parts of sociology?

1:21:44.560 --> 1:21:49.120
 What about philosophy, like studies of human nature from different perspectives?

1:21:49.120 --> 1:21:53.200
 Absolutely. And by the way, it works both ways. So let's take biology for a moment.

1:21:53.200 --> 1:21:57.040
 It turns out a cell is basically a bunch of if, then statements, if you look at it the right way,

1:21:57.680 --> 1:22:01.680
 which is nice because I understand if, then statements. I never really enjoyed biology,

1:22:01.680 --> 1:22:05.360
 but I do understand if, then statements. And if you tell the biologists that and they begin to

1:22:05.360 --> 1:22:09.520
 understand that, it actually helps them to think about a bunch of really cool things.

1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:15.040
 There'll still be biology involved, but whatever. On the other hand, the fact of biology is,

1:22:15.040 --> 1:22:19.520
 in fact, the cell is a bunch of if, then statements or whatever, allows the computationalist to think

1:22:19.520 --> 1:22:23.520
 differently about the language and the way that we, well, certainly the way we would do AI machine

1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:28.000
 learning, but there's just even the way that we think about computation. So the important thing

1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:33.680
 to me is as my engineering colleagues who are not in computer science worry about computer science

1:22:33.680 --> 1:22:40.560
 eating up engineering to colleges where computer science is trapped. It's not a worry. You shouldn't

1:22:40.560 --> 1:22:45.280
 worry about that at all. Computer science computing, it's central, but it's not the

1:22:45.280 --> 1:22:50.960
 most important thing in the world. It's not more important. It is just key to helping others do

1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:54.800
 other cool things they're going to do. You're not going to be a historian in 2030. You're not going

1:22:54.800 --> 1:22:58.480
 to get your PhD in history without understanding some data science and computing, because the way

1:22:58.480 --> 1:23:02.960
 you're going to get history done in part, and I say done, the way you're going to get it done

1:23:02.960 --> 1:23:06.160
 is you're going to look at data and you're going to let, you're going to have the system that's

1:23:06.160 --> 1:23:09.920
 going to help you to analyze things to help you to think about a better way to describe history

1:23:09.920 --> 1:23:13.600
 and to understand what's going on and what it tells us about where we might be going. The same

1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:17.040
 is true for psychology. Same is true for all of these things. The reason I brought that up is

1:23:17.040 --> 1:23:21.920
 because the philosopher has a lot to say about computing. The psychologist has a lot to say

1:23:21.920 --> 1:23:26.480
 about the way humans interact with computing, right? And certainly a lot about intelligence, which

1:23:27.440 --> 1:23:32.480
 at least for me, ultimately is kind of the goal of building these computational devices is to build

1:23:32.480 --> 1:23:37.680
 something intelligent. Did you think computing will eat everything in some certain sense or almost

1:23:37.680 --> 1:23:41.680
 like disappear because it's part of everything? It's so funny you say this. I want to say it's

1:23:41.680 --> 1:23:47.600
 going to metastasize, but there's kind of two ways that fields destroy themselves. One is they become

1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:55.120
 super narrow. And I think we can think of fields that might be that way. They become pure. And we

1:23:55.120 --> 1:23:59.600
 have that instinct. We have that impulse. I'm sure you can think of several people who want computer

1:23:59.600 --> 1:24:05.200
 science to be this pure thing. The other way is you become everywhere and you become everything

1:24:05.200 --> 1:24:10.240
 and nothing. And so everyone says, you know, I'm going to teach Fortran for engineers or whatever.

1:24:10.240 --> 1:24:14.880
 I'm going to do this. And then you lose the thing that makes it worth studying in and of itself.

1:24:15.440 --> 1:24:19.520
 The thing about computing, and this is not unique to computing, though at this point in time,

1:24:19.520 --> 1:24:25.520
 it is distinctive about computing where we happen to be in 2020 is we are both a thriving major.

1:24:26.480 --> 1:24:34.320
 In fact, the thriving major, almost every place. And we're a service unit because people need to

1:24:34.320 --> 1:24:39.520
 know the things we need to know. And our job, much as the mathematician's job is to help,

1:24:39.520 --> 1:24:43.440
 you know, this person over here to think like a mathematician, much the way the point isn't the

1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:47.600
 point of view taking chemistry as a freshman is not to learn chemistry. It's to learn to think

1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:52.080
 like a scientist, right? Our job is to help them to think, think like a computationalist. And we

1:24:52.080 --> 1:24:56.880
 have to take both of those things very seriously. And I'm not sure that as a field, we have

1:24:56.880 --> 1:25:01.840
 historically certainly taken the second thing that our job is to help them to think a certain way.

1:25:01.840 --> 1:25:04.960
 People who aren't going to be our major, I don't think we've taken that that very seriously at all.

1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:09.600
 I don't know if you know who Dan Carlin is. He has this podcast called Hardcore History.

1:25:09.600 --> 1:25:10.000
 Yes.

1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:18.160
 I've just did an amazing four hour conversation with him, mostly about Hitler. But I bring him

1:25:18.160 --> 1:25:24.160
 up because he talks about this idea that it's possible that history as a field will become,

1:25:24.160 --> 1:25:31.440
 like currently, most people study history a little bit, kind of are aware of it. We have a

1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:35.920
 conversation about it, different parts of it. I mean, there's a lot of criticism to say that some

1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:41.760
 parts of history are being ignored, blah, blah, blah, so on. But most people are able to have a

1:25:41.760 --> 1:25:49.200
 curiosity and able to learn it. His thought is it's possible given the way social media works,

1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:55.840
 the current way we communicate, that history becomes a niche field where literally most people

1:25:55.840 --> 1:26:01.680
 just ignore because everything is happening so fast that the history starts losing its meaning.

1:26:01.680 --> 1:26:07.840
 And then it starts being a thing that only, you know, like the theoretical computer science,

1:26:07.840 --> 1:26:13.120
 part of computer science, it becomes a niche thing that only like the rare holders of the

1:26:13.840 --> 1:26:19.920
 world wars and the, you know, all the history, the founding of the United States, all those kinds of

1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:26.560
 things, the Civil Wars. And it's a kind of profound thing to think about how these,

1:26:27.360 --> 1:26:33.360
 how we can lose track, how we can lose these fields when they're best, like in the case of

1:26:33.360 --> 1:26:40.480
 history, is best for that to be a pervasive thing that everybody learns and thinks about and so on.

1:26:40.480 --> 1:26:46.880
 And I would say computing is quite obviously similar to history in the sense that it seems

1:26:46.880 --> 1:26:53.520
 like it should be a part of everybody's life to some degree, especially like as we move into the

1:26:53.520 --> 1:26:59.840
 later parts of the 21st century. And it's not obvious that that's the way it'll go. It might

1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:06.640
 be in the hands of the few still. Like depending if it's machine learning, you know, it's unclear

1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:12.240
 that computing will win out. It's currently very successful, but it's not, I would say that's

1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:16.880
 something, I mean, you're at the leadership level of this. You're defining the future. So it's in

1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:23.760
 your hands. No pressure. But like, it feels like there's multiple ways this can go. And there's

1:27:23.760 --> 1:27:29.200
 this kind of conversation of everybody should learn to code, right? The changing nature of jobs

1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:41.200
 and so on. Do you have a sense of what your role in education of computing is here? Like what's

1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:46.000
 the hopeful path forward? There's a lot there. I will say that, well, first off, it would be an

1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:51.360
 absolute shame if no one studied history. On the other hand, as t approaches infinity, the amount

1:27:51.360 --> 1:27:59.440
 of history is presumably also growing at least linearly. And so you have to forget more and more

1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:02.960
 of history, but history needs to always be there. I mean, I can imagine a world where,

1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:07.360
 you know, if you think of your brains as being outside of your head, that you can kind of learn

1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:12.560
 the history you need to know when you need to know it. That seems fanciful, but it's a kind of way of,

1:28:12.560 --> 1:28:17.440
 you know, is there a sufficient statistic of history? No. And there certainly, but there may

1:28:17.440 --> 1:28:20.560
 be for the particular thing you have to care about, but you know, those who do not remember.

1:28:20.560 --> 1:28:23.040
 It's for our objective camera discussion, right?

1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:26.800
 Yeah. Right. And, you know, we've already lost lots of history. And of course you have your

1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:31.120
 own history that some of which will be, it's even lost to you, right? You don't even remember

1:28:31.120 --> 1:28:33.280
 whatever it was you were doing 17 years ago.

1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:34.320
 All the ex girlfriends.

1:28:34.320 --> 1:28:34.640
 Yeah.

1:28:34.640 --> 1:28:35.680
 Gone.

1:28:35.680 --> 1:28:41.280
 Exactly. So, you know, history is being lost anyway, but the big lessons of history shouldn't

1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:46.080
 be. And I think, you know, to take it to the question of computing and sort of education,

1:28:46.080 --> 1:28:49.680
 the point is you have to get across those lessons. You have to get across the way of thinking.

1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:54.480
 And you have to be able to go back and, you know, you don't want to lose the data,

1:28:54.480 --> 1:28:57.680
 even if, you know, you don't necessarily have the information at your fingertips.

1:28:57.680 --> 1:29:02.640
 With computing, I think it's somewhat different. Everyone doesn't have to learn how to code,

1:29:02.640 --> 1:29:07.680
 but everyone needs to learn how to think in the way that you can be precise. And I mean,

1:29:07.680 --> 1:29:13.840
 precise in the sense of repeatable, not just, you know, in the sense of not resolution in the sense

1:29:13.840 --> 1:29:19.680
 of get the right number of bits, um, in saying what it is you want the machine to do and being

1:29:19.680 --> 1:29:26.480
 able to describe a problem in such a way that it is executable, which we are not human beings are

1:29:26.480 --> 1:29:30.160
 not very good at that. In fact, I think we spend much of our time talking back and forth just to

1:29:30.160 --> 1:29:34.080
 kind of vaguely understand what the other person means and hope we get it good enough that we can,

1:29:34.080 --> 1:29:38.560
 we can act accordingly. Um, you can't do that with machines, at least not yet. And so,

1:29:39.440 --> 1:29:45.840
 you know, having to think that precisely about things is quite important. And that's somewhat

1:29:45.840 --> 1:29:53.040
 different from coding. Coding is a crude means to an end. On the other hand, the idea of coding,

1:29:53.600 --> 1:29:57.760
 what that means that it's a programming language and it has these sort of things that you fiddle

1:29:57.760 --> 1:30:01.920
 with in these ways that you express. That is an incredibly important point. In fact, I would argue

1:30:01.920 --> 1:30:07.120
 that one of the big holes in machine learning right now in an AI is that we forget that we are

1:30:07.120 --> 1:30:13.280
 basically doing software engineering. We forget that we are doing, um, we're using programming,

1:30:13.280 --> 1:30:16.720
 like we're using languages to express what we're doing. We get just so all caught up in the deep

1:30:16.720 --> 1:30:22.560
 network or we get all caught up in whatever that we forget that, you know, we're making decisions

1:30:22.560 --> 1:30:26.880
 based upon a set of parameters that we made up. And if we did slightly different parameters,

1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:30.400
 we'd have completely different, different outcomes. And so the lesson of computing,

1:30:30.400 --> 1:30:36.480
 computer science education is to be able to think like that and to be aware of it when you're doing

1:30:36.480 --> 1:30:40.560
 it. Basically, it's, you know, at the end of the day, it's a way of, um, surfacing your assumptions.

1:30:41.120 --> 1:30:45.760
 I mean, we call them parameters or, you know, we, we, we call them if then statements or whatever,

1:30:45.760 --> 1:30:50.080
 but you're forced to surface those, those assumptions. That's the key, the key thing that

1:30:50.080 --> 1:30:53.040
 you should get out of a computing education that, and that the models and languages and

1:30:53.040 --> 1:30:58.400
 machines are equivalent, but it actually follows from that, that you have to be explicit about,

1:30:58.400 --> 1:31:02.800
 about what it is you're trying to do because the model you're building is something you will one

1:31:02.800 --> 1:31:08.480
 day run. So you better get it right, or at least understand it and be able to express roughly what,

1:31:08.480 --> 1:31:17.200
 what you want to express. So I think it is key that we figure out how to educate everyone to

1:31:17.200 --> 1:31:23.440
 think that way, because at the end, it would not only make them better at whatever it is that they

1:31:23.440 --> 1:31:30.480
 are doing. And I emphasize doing it'll also make them better citizens. It'll help them to understand

1:31:30.480 --> 1:31:35.920
 what others are doing to them so that they can react accordingly. Cause you're not going to

1:31:35.920 --> 1:31:39.600
 solve the problem of social media in so far as you think of social media as a problem

1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:46.320
 by just making slightly better code, right? It only works if people react to it

1:31:46.320 --> 1:31:52.160
 appropriately and know what's happening and therefore take control over what they're doing.

1:31:52.160 --> 1:31:53.920
 I mean, that's, that's my take on it.

1:31:53.920 --> 1:32:00.000
 Okay. Let me try to proceed awkwardly into the topic of race.

1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:00.560
 Okay.

1:32:00.560 --> 1:32:05.440
 One is because it's a fascinating part of your story and you're just eloquent and fun about it.

1:32:05.440 --> 1:32:12.560
 And then the second is because we're living through a pretty tense time in terms of race,

1:32:12.560 --> 1:32:20.320
 tensions and discussions and ideas in this time in America. You grew up in Atlanta,

1:32:20.880 --> 1:32:24.960
 not born in Atlanta. Is some Southern state, somewhere in Tennessee, something like that?

1:32:24.960 --> 1:32:25.600
 Tennessee.

1:32:25.600 --> 1:32:34.480
 Nice. Okay. But early on you moved, you're basically, you identify as an Atlanta native.

1:32:34.480 --> 1:32:42.320
 Mm hmm. Yeah. And you've mentioned that you grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood,

1:32:42.320 --> 1:32:44.960
 by the way, black African American person of color.

1:32:44.960 --> 1:32:46.000
 I prefer black.

1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:46.400
 Black.

1:32:46.400 --> 1:32:47.520
 With a capital B.

1:32:47.520 --> 1:32:50.160
 With a capital B. The other letters are...

1:32:50.720 --> 1:32:51.440
 The rest of them, no matter.

1:32:54.640 --> 1:32:59.600
 Okay. So the predominantly black neighborhood. And so you didn't almost see race. Maybe you

1:32:59.600 --> 1:33:05.200
 can correct me on that. And then just in the video you talked about when you showed up to

1:33:05.200 --> 1:33:12.640
 Georgia Tech for your undergrad, you're one of the only black folks there. And that was like,

1:33:12.640 --> 1:33:19.280
 oh, that was a new experience. So can you take me from just a human perspective,

1:33:19.280 --> 1:33:23.120
 but also from a race perspective, your journey growing up in Atlanta

1:33:23.120 --> 1:33:24.800
 and then showing up at Georgia Tech?

1:33:24.800 --> 1:33:28.160
 Okay. That's easy. And by the way, that story continues through MIT as well.

1:33:28.160 --> 1:33:32.960
 Yeah. In fact, it was quite a bit more stark at MIT and Boston.

1:33:32.960 --> 1:33:37.920
 So maybe just a quick pause, Georgia Tech was undergrad, MIT was graduate school.

1:33:37.920 --> 1:33:41.440
 Mm hmm. And I went directly to grad school from undergrad. So I had no

1:33:42.240 --> 1:33:45.600
 distractions in between my bachelor's and my master's and PhD.

1:33:45.600 --> 1:33:47.760
 You didn't go on a backpacking trip in Europe?

1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:52.640
 Didn't do any of that. In fact, I literally went to IBM for three months, got in a car,

1:33:52.640 --> 1:33:55.600
 and drove straight to Boston with my mother, or Cambridge.

1:33:55.600 --> 1:33:55.840
 Yeah.

1:33:55.840 --> 1:34:02.080
 I moved into an apartment I'd never seen over the Royal East. Anyway, that's another story.

1:34:02.080 --> 1:34:03.440
 So let me tell you a little bit about it.

1:34:03.440 --> 1:34:04.240
 You miss MIT?

1:34:04.880 --> 1:34:09.040
 Oh, I loved MIT. I don't miss Boston at all, but I loved MIT.

1:34:09.040 --> 1:34:10.000
 That was fighting words.

1:34:11.120 --> 1:34:14.800
 So let's back up to this. So as you said, I was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:18.080
 My earliest memory is arriving in Atlanta in a moving truck at the age of three and a half.

1:34:18.080 --> 1:34:22.400
 So I think of myself as being from Atlanta, very distinct memory of that. So I grew up in Atlanta.

1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:28.560
 It's the only place I ever knew as a kid. I loved it. Like much of the country, and certainly

1:34:28.560 --> 1:34:34.240
 much of Atlanta in the 70s and 80s, it was deeply highly segregated, though not in a way that I

1:34:34.240 --> 1:34:39.680
 think was obvious to you unless you were looking at it or were old enough to have noticed it.

1:34:39.680 --> 1:34:43.360
 But you could divide up Atlanta, and Atlanta is hardly unique in this way, by highway,

1:34:43.360 --> 1:34:47.920
 and you could get racing class that way. So I grew up not only in a predominantly

1:34:47.920 --> 1:34:55.920
 black area, to say the very least, I grew up on the poor side of that. But I was very much aware

1:34:55.920 --> 1:35:01.200
 of race for a bunch of reasons, one that people made certain that I was, my family did, but also

1:35:01.200 --> 1:35:08.320
 that it would come up. So in first grade, I had a girlfriend. I say I had a girlfriend. I didn't

1:35:08.320 --> 1:35:13.120
 have a girlfriend. I wasn't even entirely sure what girls were in the first grade. But I do remember

1:35:13.120 --> 1:35:17.680
 she decided I was her girlfriend's little white girl named Heather. And we had a long discussion

1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:21.440
 about how it was okay for us to be boyfriend and girlfriend, despite the fact that she was white

1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:25.680
 and I was black. Between the two of you? Did your parents know about this?

1:35:26.400 --> 1:35:31.120
 Yes. But being a girlfriend and boyfriend in first grade just basically meant that you spent

1:35:31.120 --> 1:35:38.160
 slightly more time together during recess. I think we Eskimo kissed once. It didn't mean anything.

1:35:38.160 --> 1:35:41.440
 It was. At the time, it felt very scandalous because everyone was watching. I was like,

1:35:41.440 --> 1:35:45.920
 ah, my life is now my life has changed in first grade. No one told me elementary school would be

1:35:45.920 --> 1:35:50.400
 like this. Did you write poetry or not in first grade? That would come later. That would come

1:35:50.400 --> 1:35:56.400
 during puberty when I wrote lots and lots of poetry. Anyway, so I was aware of it. I didn't

1:35:56.400 --> 1:36:01.280
 think too much about it, but I was aware of it. But I was surrounded. It wasn't that I wasn't

1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:07.920
 aware of race. It's that I wasn't aware that I was a minority. It's different. And it's because I

1:36:07.920 --> 1:36:12.080
 wasn't as far as my world was concerned. I mean, I'm six years old, five years old in first grade.

1:36:12.880 --> 1:36:16.560
 The world is the seven people I see every day. So it didn't feel that way at all.

1:36:17.840 --> 1:36:21.840
 And by the way, this being Atlanta, home of the civil rights movement and all the rest,

1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:25.520
 it meant that when I looked at TV, which back then one did because there were only three,

1:36:25.520 --> 1:36:32.800
 four or five channels. And I saw the news, which my mother might make me watch. Monica Kaufman was

1:36:33.520 --> 1:36:37.680
 on TV telling me the news and they were all black and the mayor was black and always been

1:36:37.680 --> 1:36:43.520
 black. And so it just never occurred to me. When I went to Georgia Tech, I remember the first day

1:36:43.520 --> 1:36:49.360
 walking across campus from West campus to East campus and realizing along the way that of the

1:36:49.360 --> 1:36:53.200
 hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of students that I was seeing, I was the only black

1:36:53.200 --> 1:36:59.920
 one. That was enlightening and very off putting because it occurred to me. And then of course,

1:36:59.920 --> 1:37:05.440
 it continued that way for, well, for the rest of my, for much of the rest of my career at Georgia

1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:09.440
 Tech. Of course, I found lots of other students and I met people cause in Atlanta, you're either

1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:14.560
 black or you're white. There was nothing else. So I began to meet students of Asian descent and I

1:37:14.560 --> 1:37:18.320
 met students who we would call Hispanic and so on and so forth. And you know, so my world,

1:37:18.320 --> 1:37:22.320
 this is what college is supposed to do, right? It's supposed to open you up to people. And it

1:37:22.320 --> 1:37:31.200
 did, but it was a very strange thing to be in the minority. When I came to Boston, I will tell you

1:37:31.200 --> 1:37:38.320
 a story. I applied to one place as an undergrad, Georgia Tech, because I was stupid. I didn't know

1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:43.360
 any better. I just didn't know any better, right? No one told me. When I went to grad school,

1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:47.280
 I applied to three places, Georgia Tech, because that's where I was, MIT and CMU.

1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:58.480
 When I got in to MIT, I got into CMU, but I had a friend who went to CMU. And so I asked him what

1:37:58.480 --> 1:38:03.200
 he thought about it. He spent his time explaining to me about Pittsburgh, much less about CMU,

1:38:03.200 --> 1:38:07.760
 but more about Pittsburgh, which I developed a strong opinion based upon his strong opinion,

1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:12.240
 something about the sun coming out two days out of the year. And I didn't get a chance to go there

1:38:12.240 --> 1:38:17.920
 because the timing was wrong. I think it was because the timing was wrong. At MIT, I asked

1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:24.480
 20 people I knew, either when I visited or I had already known for a variety of reasons,

1:38:24.480 --> 1:38:30.160
 whether they liked Boston. And 10 of them loved it, and 10 of them hated it. The 10 who loved it

1:38:30.160 --> 1:38:35.040
 were all white. The 10 who hated it were all black. And they explained to me very much why

1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:41.040
 that was the case. Both stats told me why. And the stories were remarkably the same for the

1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:46.560
 two clusters. And I came up here, and I could see it immediately, why people would love it

1:38:46.560 --> 1:38:50.720
 and why people would not. And why people tell you about the nice coffee shops.

1:38:50.720 --> 1:38:55.840
 Well, it wasn't coffee shops. It was used CD places. But yeah, it was that kind of a thing.

1:38:55.840 --> 1:39:00.000
 Nice shops. Oh, there's all these students here. Harvard Square is beautiful. You can do all these

1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:02.720
 things, and you can walk. And something about the outdoors, which I wasn't the slightest bit

1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:05.200
 interested in. The outdoors is for the bugs. It's not for humans.

1:39:08.400 --> 1:39:09.680
 That should be a t shirt.

1:39:09.680 --> 1:39:14.800
 Yeah, that's the way I feel about it. And the black folk told me completely different stories

1:39:14.800 --> 1:39:22.000
 about which part of town you did not want to be caught in after dark. But that was nothing new.

1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:27.600
 So I decided that MIT was a great place to be as a university. And I believed it then,

1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:32.160
 I believe it now. And that whatever it is I wanted to do, I thought I knew what I wanted to do,

1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:36.960
 but what if I was wrong? Someone there would know how to do it. Of course, then I would pick the

1:39:36.960 --> 1:39:42.320
 one topic that nobody was working on at the time, but that's okay. It was great. And so I thought

1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:46.480
 that I would be fine. And I'd only be there for like four or five years. I told myself,

1:39:46.480 --> 1:39:50.400
 which turned out not to be true at all. But I enjoyed my time. I enjoyed my time there.

1:39:50.400 --> 1:39:57.760
 But I did see a lot of... I ran across a lot of things that were driven by what I look like

1:39:58.400 --> 1:40:05.920
 while I was here. I got asked a lot of questions. I ran into a lot of cops. I saw a lot about the

1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:09.120
 city. But at the time, I mean, I haven't been here a long time. These are the things that I

1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:17.920
 remember. So this is 1990. There was not a single black radio station. Now this is 1990. I don't

1:40:17.920 --> 1:40:21.920
 know if there are any radio stations anymore. I'm sure there are, but I don't listen to the radio

1:40:21.920 --> 1:40:27.520
 anymore and almost no one does, at least if you're under a certain age. But the idea is you could be

1:40:27.520 --> 1:40:30.800
 in a major metropolitan area and there wasn't a single black radio station, by which I mean,

1:40:30.800 --> 1:40:37.840
 a radio station to play what we would call black music then, was absurd, but somehow captured kind

1:40:37.840 --> 1:40:43.200
 of everything about the city. I grew up in Atlanta and you've heard me tell you about Atlanta.

1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:50.240
 Boston had no economically viable or socially cohesive black middle class.

1:40:51.840 --> 1:40:56.480
 Insofar as it existed, it was uniformly distributed throughout large parts, not all parts,

1:40:56.480 --> 1:41:01.600
 but large parts of the city. And where you had concentrations of black Bostonians,

1:41:02.160 --> 1:41:07.040
 they tended to be poor. It was very different from where I grew up. I grew up on the poor side of

1:41:07.040 --> 1:41:13.040
 town, sure. But then in high school, well, in ninth grade, we didn't have middle school. I went

1:41:13.040 --> 1:41:17.200
 to an eighth grade school where there was a lot of, let's just say, we had a riot the year that

1:41:17.200 --> 1:41:24.800
 I was there. There was at least one major fight every week. It was an amazing experience. But

1:41:24.800 --> 1:41:30.640
 when I went to ninth grade, I went to Academy. Math and Science Academy, Mays High. It was a

1:41:30.640 --> 1:41:36.240
 public school. It was a magnet school. That's why I was able to go there. It was the first high school,

1:41:36.240 --> 1:41:41.040
 I think, in the state of Georgia to sweep the state math and science fairs. It was great. It had

1:41:44.080 --> 1:41:50.640
 385 students, all but four of whom were black. I went to school with the daughter of the

1:41:51.200 --> 1:41:56.560
 former mayor of Atlanta, Michael Jackson's cousin. I mean, it was an upper middle class.

1:41:56.560 --> 1:41:57.120
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani Dropping names.

1:41:57.120 --> 1:41:59.520
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani You know, I just drop names occasionally.

1:41:59.520 --> 1:42:03.120
 You know, drop the mic, drop some names. Just to let you know, I used to hang out with Michael

1:42:03.120 --> 1:42:07.680
 Jackson's cousin, 12th cousin, nine times removed. I don't know. The point is, they had money. We

1:42:07.680 --> 1:42:12.160
 had a parking problem because the kids had cars. I did not come from a place where you had cars.

1:42:12.160 --> 1:42:21.280
 I had my first car when I came to MIT, actually. So, it was just a very different experience for

1:42:21.280 --> 1:42:26.000
 me. But I'd been to places where whether you were rich or whether you were poor, you know,

1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:29.200
 you could be black and rich or black and poor. And it was there and there were places and they

1:42:29.200 --> 1:42:35.520
 were segregated by class as well as by race. But that existed. Here, at least when I was here,

1:42:35.520 --> 1:42:39.920
 didn't feel that way at all. And it felt like a bunch of a really interesting contradiction.

1:42:41.280 --> 1:42:47.760
 It felt like it was the interracial dating capital of the country. It really felt that way.

1:42:49.360 --> 1:42:55.120
 But it also felt like the most racist place I ever spent any time. You know, you couldn't go

1:42:55.120 --> 1:42:59.360
 up the Orange Line at that time. I mean, again, that was 30 years ago. I don't know what it's

1:42:59.360 --> 1:43:05.520
 like now. But there were places you couldn't go. And you knew it. Everybody knew it. And there were

1:43:05.520 --> 1:43:12.720
 places you couldn't live. And everybody knew that. And that was just the greater Boston area in 1992.

1:43:12.720 --> 1:43:14.880
 Subtle racism or explicit racism?

1:43:14.880 --> 1:43:15.380
 Both.

1:43:16.720 --> 1:43:19.440
 In terms of within the institutions, did you feel...

1:43:19.440 --> 1:43:26.080
 Was there levels in which you were empowered to be first or one of the first black people in a

1:43:26.080 --> 1:43:31.360
 particular discipline in some of these great institutions that you were a part of? You know,

1:43:31.360 --> 1:43:36.720
 Georgia Tech or MIT? And was there a part where it felt limiting?

1:43:37.760 --> 1:43:45.120
 I always felt empowered. Some of that was my own delusion, I think. But it worked out. So I never

1:43:45.120 --> 1:43:52.240
 felt... In fact, quite the opposite. Not only did I not feel as if no one was trying to stop me,

1:43:52.240 --> 1:43:57.760
 I had the distinct impression that people wanted me to succeed. By people, I meant the people in

1:43:57.760 --> 1:44:04.960
 power. Not my fellow students. Not that they didn't want me to succeed. But I felt supported,

1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:10.480
 or at least that people were happy to see me succeed at least as much as anyone else. But,

1:44:10.480 --> 1:44:15.280
 you know, 1990, you're dealing with a different set of problems. You're very early, at least in

1:44:15.280 --> 1:44:20.720
 computer science, you're very early in the Jackie Robinson period. There's this thing called the

1:44:20.720 --> 1:44:27.120
 Jackie Robinson syndrome, which is that the first one has to be perfect or has to be sure to

1:44:27.120 --> 1:44:32.960
 succeed because if that person fails, no one else comes after for a long time. So it was kind of in

1:44:32.960 --> 1:44:37.040
 everyone's best interest. But I think it came from a sincere place. I'm completely sure that people

1:44:37.040 --> 1:44:43.200
 went out of their way to try to make certain that the environment would be good. Not just for me,

1:44:43.200 --> 1:44:47.200
 but for the other people who, of course, were around. And I was the only person in the iLab,

1:44:47.200 --> 1:44:52.400
 but I wasn't the only person at MIT by a long shot. On the other hand, we're what?

1:44:53.120 --> 1:44:57.760
 At that point, we would have been, what, less than 20 years away from the first black PhD to

1:44:57.760 --> 1:45:03.840
 graduate from MIT, right? Shirley Jackson, right? 1971, something like that? Somewhere around then.

1:45:03.840 --> 1:45:09.680
 So we weren't that far away from the first first, and we were still another eight years away from

1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:16.880
 the first black PhD in computer science, right? So it was a sort of interesting time. But I did

1:45:16.880 --> 1:45:25.280
 not feel as if the institutions of the university were against any of that. And furthermore, I felt

1:45:25.280 --> 1:45:30.960
 as if there was enough of a critical mass across the institute from students and probably faculty

1:45:30.960 --> 1:45:35.680
 that I didn't know them, who wanted to make certain that the right thing happened. It was very

1:45:35.680 --> 1:45:41.600
 different from the institutions of the rest of the city, which I think were designed in such a way

1:45:41.600 --> 1:45:44.000
 that they felt no need to be supportive.

1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:52.640
 Let me ask a touchy question on that. So you kind of said that you didn't feel,

1:45:52.640 --> 1:45:59.360
 you felt empowered. Is there some lesson, advice, in the sense that no matter what,

1:46:00.160 --> 1:46:05.120
 you should feel empowered? You said, you used the word, I think, illusion or delusion.

1:46:05.920 --> 1:46:14.480
 Is there a sense from the individual perspective where you should always kind of ignore, you know,

1:46:14.480 --> 1:46:27.120
 the, ignore your own eyes, ignore the little forces that you are able to observe around you,

1:46:27.120 --> 1:46:33.040
 that are like trying to mess with you of whether it's jealousy, whether it's hatred in its pure

1:46:33.040 --> 1:46:38.960
 form, whether it's just hatred in its like deluded form, all that kind of stuff?

1:46:38.960 --> 1:46:44.480
 And just kind of see yourself as empowered and confident and all those kinds of things.

1:46:44.480 --> 1:46:47.680
 I mean, it certainly helps, but it's, there's a trade off, right? You have to be deluded enough

1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:51.360
 to think that you can succeed. I mean, you can't get a PhD unless you're crazy enough to think you

1:46:51.360 --> 1:46:56.320
 can invent something that no one else has come up with. I mean, that kind of massive delusion is that

1:46:56.320 --> 1:46:59.840
 you have to be deluded enough to believe that you can succeed despite whatever odds you see

1:46:59.840 --> 1:47:03.280
 in front of you, but you can't be so deluded that you don't think that you need to step out of

1:47:03.280 --> 1:47:11.760
 the way of the oncoming train, right? So it's all a trade off, right? You have to kind of believe in

1:47:11.760 --> 1:47:16.800
 yourself. It helps to have a support group around you in some way or another. I was able to find

1:47:16.800 --> 1:47:21.440
 that, I've been able to find that wherever I've gone, even if it wasn't necessarily on the floor

1:47:21.440 --> 1:47:26.080
 that I was in, I had lots of friends when I was here. Many of them still live here. And I've kept

1:47:26.080 --> 1:47:30.800
 up with many of them. So I felt supported. And certainly I had my mother and my family and those

1:47:30.800 --> 1:47:37.200
 people back home that I could always lean back on, even if it were a long distance call that cost

1:47:37.200 --> 1:47:41.680
 money, which is not something that any of the kids today even know what I'm talking about. But

1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:45.920
 back then it mattered, calling my mom was an expensive proposition. But you have that and

1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:51.280
 it's fine. I think it helps. But you cannot be so deluded that you miss the obvious because it makes

1:47:51.280 --> 1:47:55.920
 things slower and it makes you think you're doing better than you are and it will hurt you in the

1:47:55.920 --> 1:48:04.400
 long run. You mentioned cops. You tell a story of being pulled over. Perhaps it happened more than

1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:11.040
 once. More than once, for sure. One, could you tell that story? And in general, can you give me

1:48:11.040 --> 1:48:22.640
 a sense of what the world looks like when the law doesn't always look at you with a blank slate?

1:48:22.640 --> 1:48:33.280
 With a blank slate with objective eyes? I don't know how to say it more poetically.

1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:39.040
 Well, I guess the, I don't either. I guess the answer is it looks exactly the way it looks now

1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:44.640
 because this is the world that we happen to live in, right? It's people clustering and doing the

1:48:44.640 --> 1:48:50.880
 things that they do and making decisions based on one or two bits of information they find

1:48:50.880 --> 1:48:56.080
 relevant, which, by the way, are all positive feedback loops, which makes it easier for you

1:48:56.080 --> 1:48:59.520
 to believe what you believed before because you behave in a certain way that makes it true and

1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:06.000
 it goes on and circles and then cycles and cycles and then cycles. So it's just about being on edge.

1:49:06.960 --> 1:49:09.840
 I do not, despite having made it over 50 now.

1:49:11.760 --> 1:49:13.520
 Congratulations, brother.

1:49:13.520 --> 1:49:16.080
 God, I have a few gray hairs here and there.

1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:16.800
 You did pretty good.

1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:24.960
 I think, I don't imagine I will ever see a police officer and not get very, very tense.

1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:30.560
 Now, everyone gets a little tense because it probably means you're being pulled over for

1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:34.400
 speeding or something, or you're going to get a ticket or whatever, right? I mean,

1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:39.280
 the interesting thing about the law in general is that most human beings experience of it is

1:49:39.280 --> 1:49:43.920
 fundamentally negative, right? You're only dealing with a lawyer if you're in trouble,

1:49:43.920 --> 1:49:49.680
 except in a few very small circumstances, right? So that's an underlying reality.

1:49:49.680 --> 1:49:55.120
 Now, imagine that that's also at the hands of the police officer. I remember the time when I got

1:49:55.120 --> 1:50:02.080
 pulled over that time, halfway between Boston and Wellesley, actually. I remember thinking

1:50:04.160 --> 1:50:11.360
 when he pulled his gun on me that if he shot me right now, he'd get away with it. That was the

1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:16.480
 that was the worst thing that I felt about that particular moment, is that if he shoots me now,

1:50:16.480 --> 1:50:22.640
 he will get away with it. It would be years later when I realized actually much worse than that

1:50:24.480 --> 1:50:30.880
 is that he'd get away with it. And if it became a thing that other people knew about,

1:50:30.880 --> 1:50:34.240
 odds would be, of course, that it wouldn't. But if it became a thing that other people knew about,

1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:39.680
 if I was living in today's world as opposed to the world 30 years ago, that not only would

1:50:39.680 --> 1:50:45.360
 get away with it, but that I would be painted a villain. I was probably big and scary, and I

1:50:45.360 --> 1:50:49.040
 probably moved too fast, and if only I'd done what he said, and da, da, da, da, da, da, da,

1:50:49.040 --> 1:50:55.120
 which is somehow worse, right? You know, that hurts not just you, you're dead, but your family,

1:50:55.760 --> 1:51:00.960
 and the way people look at you, and look at your legacy or your history, that's terrible.

1:51:00.960 --> 1:51:05.360
 And it would work. I absolutely believe it would have worked had he done it. Now, he didn't. I

1:51:05.360 --> 1:51:08.640
 don't think he wanted to shoot me. I don't think he felt like killing anybody. He did not go out

1:51:08.640 --> 1:51:12.880
 that night expecting to do that or planning on doing it, and I wouldn't be surprised if he never,

1:51:12.880 --> 1:51:16.800
 ever did that or ever even pulled his gun again. I don't know the man's name. I don't remember

1:51:16.800 --> 1:51:20.320
 anything about him. I do remember the gun. Guns are very big when they're in your face. I can tell

1:51:20.320 --> 1:51:24.480
 you this much. They're much larger than they seem. But... And you're basically like speeding or

1:51:24.480 --> 1:51:28.400
 something like that? He said I ran a light, I think. You ran a light. I don't think I ran a

1:51:28.400 --> 1:51:33.040
 light, but you know, in fact, I may not have even gotten a ticket. I may have just gotten a warning.

1:51:33.040 --> 1:51:37.920
 I think he was a little... But he pulled a gun. Yeah. Apparently I moved too fast or something.

1:51:37.920 --> 1:51:42.240
 Rolled my window down before I should have. It's unclear. I think he thought I was going to do

1:51:42.240 --> 1:51:48.640
 something, or at least that's how he behaved. So how, if we can take a little walk around your

1:51:48.640 --> 1:51:58.880
 brain, how do you feel about that guy and how do you feel about cops after that experience?

1:51:58.880 --> 1:52:03.680
 Well, I don't remember that guy, but my view on police officers is the same view I have about

1:52:03.680 --> 1:52:12.560
 lots of things. Fire is an important and necessary thing in the world, but you must respect fire

1:52:12.560 --> 1:52:19.360
 because it will burn you. Fire is a necessary evil in the sense that it can burn you. Necessary

1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:25.280
 in the sense that, you know, heat and all the other things that we use fire for. So when I see

1:52:25.280 --> 1:52:33.040
 a cop, I see a giant ball of flame and I just try to avoid it. And then some people might see

1:52:33.040 --> 1:52:36.880
 a nice place, a nice thing to roast marshmallows with a family over.

1:52:37.760 --> 1:52:39.360
 Which is fine, but I don't roast marshmallows.

1:52:40.880 --> 1:52:44.160
 Okay. So let me go a little dark and I apologize. Just talked to Dan Carlin about

1:52:44.160 --> 1:52:48.720
 Hitler for four hours. So sorry if I go dark here a little bit, but

1:52:50.800 --> 1:52:57.200
 is it easy for this experience of just being careful with the fire and avoiding it to turn

1:52:57.200 --> 1:53:05.840
 to hatred? Yeah, of course. And one might even argue that it is a logical conclusion, right?

1:53:05.840 --> 1:53:12.560
 On the other hand, you've got to live in the world and I don't think it's helpful. Hate is something

1:53:12.560 --> 1:53:20.000
 one should, I mean, hate is something that takes a lot of energy. So one should reserve it for

1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:25.360
 when it is useful and not carried around with you all the time. Again, there's a big difference

1:53:25.360 --> 1:53:30.400
 between the happy delusion that convinces you that you can actually get out of bed and

1:53:30.400 --> 1:53:36.720
 make it to work today without getting hit by a car and the sad delusion that means you can

1:53:36.720 --> 1:53:40.640
 not worry about this car that is barreling towards you, right? So we all have to be a

1:53:40.640 --> 1:53:45.680
 little deluded because otherwise we're paralyzed, right? But one should not be ridiculous.

1:53:46.240 --> 1:53:49.360
 If we go all the way back to something you said earlier about empathy,

1:53:49.360 --> 1:53:57.600
 I think what I would ask other people to get out of this one of many, many, many stories

1:53:57.600 --> 1:54:04.560
 is to recognize that it is real. People would ask me to empathize with the police officer.

1:54:04.560 --> 1:54:11.040
 I would quote back statistics saying that being a police officer isn't even in the top 10 most

1:54:11.040 --> 1:54:14.960
 dangerous jobs in the United States, you're much more likely to get killed in a taxicab.

1:54:14.960 --> 1:54:22.960
 Half of police officers are actually killed by suicide, but that means their lives are something,

1:54:22.960 --> 1:54:28.240
 something's going on there with them and I would more than happy to be empathetic about what it is

1:54:28.240 --> 1:54:34.720
 they go through and how they see the world. I think though that if we step back from what I feel,

1:54:34.720 --> 1:54:39.840
 if we step back from what an individual police officer feels, you step up a level and all this,

1:54:39.840 --> 1:54:44.560
 because all things tie back into interactive AI. The real problem here is that we've built a

1:54:44.560 --> 1:54:49.520
 narrative. We built a big structure that has made it easy for people to put themselves into different

1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:57.440
 pots in the different clusters and to basically forget that the people in the other clusters are

1:54:57.440 --> 1:55:03.840
 ultimately like them. It is useful exercise to ask yourself sometimes, I think, that if I had grown

1:55:03.840 --> 1:55:07.760
 up in a completely different house and a completely different household as a completely different

1:55:07.760 --> 1:55:12.320
 person, if I had been a woman, would I see the world differently? Would I believe what that crazy

1:55:12.320 --> 1:55:18.480
 person over there believes? And the answer is probably yes, because after all, they believe it.

1:55:19.440 --> 1:55:25.440
 And fundamentally, they're the same as you. So then what can you possibly do to fix it? How do

1:55:25.440 --> 1:55:29.760
 you fix Twitter? If you think Twitter needs to be broken or Facebook, if you think Facebook is

1:55:29.760 --> 1:55:35.280
 broken, how do you fix racism? How do you fix any of these things? That's all structural.

1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:42.320
 I mean, individual conversations matter a lot, but you have to create structures that allow people

1:55:42.320 --> 1:55:47.760
 to have those individual conversations all the time in a way that is relatively safe and that

1:55:47.760 --> 1:55:51.600
 allows them to understand that other people have had different experiences, but that ultimately

1:55:51.600 --> 1:55:57.200
 we're the same, which sounds very, I don't even know what the right word is. I'm trying to avoid

1:55:57.200 --> 1:56:01.760
 a word like saccharine, but it feels very optimistic.

1:56:01.760 --> 1:56:06.640
 But I think that's okay. I think that's a part of the delusion, is you want to be a little

1:56:06.640 --> 1:56:10.160
 optimistic and then recognize that the hard problem is actually setting up the structures

1:56:10.160 --> 1:56:14.800
 in the first place, because it's in almost no one's interest to change the infrastructure.

1:56:16.320 --> 1:56:22.000
 Right. I tend to believe that leaders have a big role to that, of selling that optimistic

1:56:22.560 --> 1:56:27.600
 delusion to everybody, and that eventually leads to the building of the structures. But that

1:56:27.600 --> 1:56:33.600
 requires a leader that unites, sort of unites everybody on a vision as opposed to divides

1:56:33.600 --> 1:56:43.600
 on a vision, which is, this particular moment in history feels like there's a nonzero probability,

1:56:43.600 --> 1:56:51.440
 if we go to the P, of something akin to a violent or a nonviolent civil war. This is one of the

1:56:51.440 --> 1:56:58.240
 most divisive periods of American history in recent, you can speak to this from a perhaps

1:56:58.800 --> 1:57:03.600
 a more knowledgeable and deeper perspective than me, but from my naive perspective, this seems like

1:57:03.600 --> 1:57:11.440
 a very strange time. There's a lot of anger, and it has to do with people, I mean, for many reasons.

1:57:11.440 --> 1:57:18.480
 One, the thing that's not spoken about, I think, much is the conflict of opinion,

1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:29.040
 much is the quiet economic pain of millions that's like growing because of COVID, because of closed

1:57:29.040 --> 1:57:35.440
 businesses, because of like lost dreams. So that's building, whatever that tension is building.

1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:41.680
 The other is, there seems to be an elevated level of emotion. I'm not sure if you can psychoanalyze

1:57:41.680 --> 1:57:47.440
 where that's coming from, but this sort of, from which the protests and so on percolated. It's like,

1:57:47.440 --> 1:57:52.080
 why now? Why this particular moment in history? Oh, because time, enough time has passed, right?

1:57:52.080 --> 1:57:56.800
 I mean, you know, the very first race riots were in Boston, not to draw anything from that.

1:57:56.800 --> 1:58:01.200
 Really? When? Oh, this is before like... Going way, I mean, like the 1700s or whatever,

1:58:01.200 --> 1:58:05.280
 right? I mean, there was a massive one in New York. I mean, I'm talking way, way, way back when.

1:58:05.280 --> 1:58:09.920
 So Boston used to be the hotbed of riots. It's just what Boston was all about,

1:58:09.920 --> 1:58:15.120
 or so I'm told from history class. There's an interesting one in New York. I remember when

1:58:15.120 --> 1:58:22.960
 that was. Anyway, the point is, you know, basically you got to get another generation,

1:58:22.960 --> 1:58:28.160
 old enough to be angry, but not so old to remember what happened the last time, right?

1:58:28.160 --> 1:58:33.120
 And that's sort of what happens. But, you know, you said like two completely, you said two things

1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:38.320
 there that I think are worth unpacking. One has to do with this sort of moment in time.

1:58:38.320 --> 1:58:43.760
 And, you know, why? Why is this sort of up built? And the other has to do with a kind of, you know,

1:58:43.760 --> 1:58:47.600
 sort of the economic reality of COVID. So I'm actually, I want to separate those things because,

1:58:47.600 --> 1:58:54.160
 for example, you know, this happened before COVID happened, right? So let's separate these two

1:58:54.160 --> 1:59:01.920
 things for a moment. Now, let me preface all this by saying that although I am interested in history,

1:59:01.920 --> 1:59:07.520
 one of my three minors as an undergrad was history, specifically history, the 1960s. Interesting. The

1:59:07.520 --> 1:59:14.160
 other was Spanish. And, okay, that's a mistake. Oh, I loved that. And history of Spanish and Spanish

1:59:14.160 --> 1:59:17.760
 history, actually, but Spanish and the other was what we would now call cognitive science. But at

1:59:17.760 --> 1:59:24.960
 the time, that's fascinating. Interesting. I minored in Cogsci here for grad school. That was

1:59:24.960 --> 1:59:29.440
 really, that was really fascinating. It was a very different experience. I mean, it was a very

1:59:29.440 --> 1:59:33.600
 it was really fascinating. It was a very different experience from all the computer science classes

1:59:33.600 --> 1:59:42.400
 I've been taking, even the Cogsci classes I was taking at an undergrad. Anyway, I'm interested

1:59:42.400 --> 1:59:48.720
 in history, but I'm hardly a historian, right? So, you know, forgive my, I will ask the audience to

1:59:48.720 --> 1:59:58.640
 forgive my simplification. But I think the question that's always worth asking, as opposed, it's the

1:59:58.640 --> 2:00:08.480
 same question, but a little different. Not why now, but why not before? Right? So why the 1950s,

2:00:08.480 --> 2:00:12.400
 60s civil rights movement as opposed to the 1930s, 1940s? Well, first off, there was a civil

2:00:12.400 --> 2:00:17.440
 rights movement in the 30s and 40s. It just wasn't of the same character or quite as well known. Post

2:00:17.440 --> 2:00:22.560
 World War II, lots of interesting things were happening. It's not as if a switch was turned on

2:00:22.560 --> 2:00:27.840
 and Brown versus the Board of Education or the Montgomery bus boycott. And that's when it

2:00:27.840 --> 2:00:30.960
 happened. These things been building up forever and go all the way back and all the way back and

2:00:30.960 --> 2:00:35.120
 all the way back. And, you know, Harriet Tubman was not born in 1950, right? So, you know, we can

2:00:35.120 --> 2:00:40.320
 take these things. It could have easily happened right after World War II. Yes. I think,

2:00:42.640 --> 2:00:50.800
 and again, I'm not a scholar. I think that the big difference was TV. These things are visible.

2:00:50.800 --> 2:00:58.080
 People can see them. It's hard to avoid, right? Why not James Farmer? Why Martin Luther King? Because

2:00:59.200 --> 2:01:06.000
 one was born 20 years after the other, whatever. I think it turns out that, you know what King's

2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:13.120
 biggest failure was in the early days? It was in Georgia. They were doing the usual thing,

2:01:13.120 --> 2:01:21.680
 trying to integrate. And I forget the guy's name, but you can look this up. But he, a cop,

2:01:21.680 --> 2:01:26.080
 he was a sheriff made a deal with the whole state of Georgia. We're going to take people and we are

2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:30.800
 going to nonviolently put them in trucks. And then we're going to take them and put them in jails

2:01:30.800 --> 2:01:35.760
 very far away from here. And we're going to do that. And we're not going to, there'll be no

2:01:35.760 --> 2:01:41.440
 reason for the press to hang around. And they did that and it worked. And the press left and

2:01:41.440 --> 2:01:48.320
 nothing changed. So next they went to Birmingham, Alabama and Bull O Connor. And you got to see on

2:01:48.320 --> 2:01:53.920
 TV, little boys and girls being hit with fire hoses and being knocked down. And there was

2:01:53.920 --> 2:01:59.840
 outrage and things changed, right? Part of the delusion is pretending that nothing bad is

2:01:59.840 --> 2:02:03.360
 happening that might force you to do something big you don't want to do. But sometimes it gets

2:02:03.360 --> 2:02:08.640
 put in your face and then you kind of can't ignore it. And a large part in my view of what happened

2:02:08.640 --> 2:02:13.440
 right was that it was too public to ignore. Now we created other ways of ignoring it.

2:02:14.480 --> 2:02:17.680
 Lots of change happened in the South, but part of that delusion was that it wasn't going to affect

2:02:17.680 --> 2:02:21.760
 the West or the Northeast. And of course it did. And that caused its own set of problems, which

2:02:21.760 --> 2:02:25.200
 went into the late sixties into the seventies. And, you know, in some ways we're living with

2:02:25.200 --> 2:02:31.600
 that legacy now and so on. So why not what's happening now? Why didn't happen 10 years ago?

2:02:32.400 --> 2:02:38.000
 I think it's people have more voices. There's not just more TV, there's social media. It's very easy

2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:44.960
 for these things to kind of build on themselves and things are just quite visible. And there's

2:02:44.960 --> 2:02:48.400
 demographic change. I mean, the world is changing rapidly, right? And so it's very difficult.

2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:52.560
 You're now seeing people you could have avoided seeing most of your life growing up in a particular

2:02:52.560 --> 2:02:58.080
 time. And it's happening, it's dispersing at a speed that is fast enough to cause

2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:06.000
 concern for some people, but not so fast to cause massive negative reaction. So that's that.

2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:10.400
 On the other hand, and again, that's a massive oversimplification, but I think there's something

2:03:10.400 --> 2:03:13.920
 there anyway, at least something worth exploring. I'm happy to be yelled at by a real historian.

2:03:13.920 --> 2:03:18.720
 Oh yeah. I mean, there's just the obvious thing. I mean, I guess you're implying, but not

2:03:19.520 --> 2:03:24.480
 saying this. I mean, it seemed to have percolated the most with just a single video, for example,

2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:34.000
 the George Floyd video. It's fascinating to think that whatever the mechanisms that put injustice

2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:42.080
 in front of our face, not like directly in front of our face, those mechanisms are the mechanisms

2:03:42.080 --> 2:03:46.720
 of change. Yeah. On the other hand, Rodney King. So no one remembers this. I seem to be the only

2:03:46.720 --> 2:03:51.360
 person who remembers this, but sometime before the Rodney King incident, there was a guy who

2:03:51.360 --> 2:03:58.080
 was a police officer who was saying that things were really bad in Southern California. And he

2:03:58.080 --> 2:04:03.040
 was going to prove it by having some news, some camera people follow him around. And he says,

2:04:03.040 --> 2:04:06.160
 I'm going to go into these towns and just follow me for a week. And you will see that I'll get

2:04:06.160 --> 2:04:11.120
 harassed. And like the first night he goes out there and he crosses into the city, some cops

2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:15.840
 pull him over and he's a police officer. Remember, they don't know that. Of course they like shove

2:04:15.840 --> 2:04:20.640
 his face through a glass window. This was on the new, like I distinctly remember watching this as

2:04:20.640 --> 2:04:25.040
 a kid. Actually, I guess I wasn't a kid. I was in college, I was in grad school at the time.

2:04:25.040 --> 2:04:30.400
 So that's not enough. Well, it disappeared like a day late. It didn't go viral.

2:04:30.400 --> 2:04:33.920
 Yeah. Whatever that is, whatever that magic thing is.

2:04:33.920 --> 2:04:38.320
 And whatever it was in 92, it was harder to go viral in 92, right? Or 91,

2:04:38.320 --> 2:04:42.000
 actually it must've been 90 or 91, but that happened. And like two days later,

2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:45.280
 it's like it never happened. Again, nobody remembers this, but I'm like the only person.

2:04:45.280 --> 2:04:49.120
 Sometimes I think I must've dreamed it. Anyway, Rodney King happens. It goes viral

2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:57.520
 or the moral equivalent thereof at the time. And eventually we get April 29th. And I don't know

2:04:57.520 --> 2:05:00.640
 what the difference was between the two things, other than one thing caught on and one thing

2:05:00.640 --> 2:05:07.280
 didn't. Maybe what's happening now is two things are feeding onto one another. One is more people

2:05:07.280 --> 2:05:14.560
 are willing to believe. And the other is there's easier and easier ways to give evidence. Cameras,

2:05:14.560 --> 2:05:17.600
 body cams or whatever, but we're still finding ourselves telling the same story. It's the same

2:05:17.600 --> 2:05:22.640
 thing over and over again. I would invite you to go back and read the op eds from what people were

2:05:22.640 --> 2:05:28.400
 saying about the violence is not the right answer after Rodney King. And then go back to 1980 and

2:05:28.400 --> 2:05:33.680
 the big riots that were happening around then and read the same op ed. It's the same words over and

2:05:33.680 --> 2:05:37.760
 over and over again. I mean, there's your remembering history right there. I mean,

2:05:37.760 --> 2:05:40.960
 it's like literally the same words. Like it could have just caught, but I'm surprised no one got

2:05:40.960 --> 2:05:46.560
 flagged for plagiarism. It's interesting if you have an opinion on the question of violence

2:05:46.560 --> 2:05:53.120
 and the popular perhaps caricature of Malcolm X versus Martin Luther King.

2:05:53.120 --> 2:05:57.280
 You know, Malcolm X was older than Martin Luther King. People kind of have it in their head that

2:05:57.280 --> 2:06:05.040
 he's younger. Well, he died sooner, but only by a few years. People think of MLK as the older

2:06:05.040 --> 2:06:10.320
 statesman and they think of Malcolm X as the young, angry, whatever, but that's more of a

2:06:10.320 --> 2:06:18.960
 narrative device. It's not true at all. I don't, I just, I reject the choice as I think it's a

2:06:18.960 --> 2:06:23.360
 false choice. I think they're just things that happen. You just do, as I said, hatred is not,

2:06:23.360 --> 2:06:26.480
 it takes a lot of energy, but you know, every once in a while you have to fight.

2:06:28.720 --> 2:06:34.160
 One thing I will say without taking a moral position, which I will not take on this matter,

2:06:34.160 --> 2:06:38.640
 violence has worked.

2:06:38.640 --> 2:06:41.360
 Yeah, that's the annoying thing.

2:06:41.360 --> 2:06:43.600
 That's the annoying thing.

2:06:43.600 --> 2:06:53.600
 It seems like over the top anger works. Outrage works. So you can say like being calm and rational

2:06:53.600 --> 2:06:59.600
 and just talking it out is going to lead to progress. But it seems like if you just look

2:06:59.600 --> 2:07:06.000
 through history being irrationally upset is the way you make progress.

2:07:06.640 --> 2:07:09.680
 Well, it's certainly the way that you get someone to notice you.

2:07:09.680 --> 2:07:10.320
 Yeah.

2:07:10.320 --> 2:07:13.760
 And if they don't notice you, I mean, what's the difference between that and what did you,

2:07:13.760 --> 2:07:17.040
 again, without taking a moral position on this, I'm just trying to observe history here.

2:07:17.040 --> 2:07:22.240
 If you, maybe if television didn't exist, the civil rights movement doesn't happen

2:07:22.240 --> 2:07:27.120
 or it takes longer or it takes a very different form. Maybe if social media doesn't exist,

2:07:27.120 --> 2:07:33.440
 a whole host of things, positive and negative don't happen. And what do any of those things

2:07:33.440 --> 2:07:40.880
 do other than expose things to people? Violence is a way of shouting. I mean,

2:07:40.880 --> 2:07:45.680
 many people far more talented and thoughtful than I have have said this in one form or another,

2:07:45.680 --> 2:07:54.160
 right? That violence is the voice of the unheard. It's a thing that people do when they feel as if

2:07:54.160 --> 2:08:00.240
 they have no other option. And sometimes we agree and sometimes we disagree. Sometimes we think

2:08:00.240 --> 2:08:05.840
 they're justified. Sometimes we think they are not, but regardless, it is a way of shouting.

2:08:06.400 --> 2:08:10.240
 And when you shout, people tend to hear you, even if they don't necessarily hear the words

2:08:10.240 --> 2:08:15.200
 that you're saying, they hear that you were shouting. I see no way. So another way of putting

2:08:15.200 --> 2:08:26.400
 it, which I think is less, let us just say provocative, but I think is true is that all

2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:32.000
 change, particularly change that impacts power requires struggle. The struggle doesn't have to

2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:38.880
 be violent, you know, but it's a struggle nonetheless. The powerful don't give up power

2:08:38.880 --> 2:08:45.280
 easily. I mean, why should they? But even so, it still has to be a struggle. And by the way,

2:08:45.840 --> 2:08:49.360
 this isn't just about, you know, violent political, whatever, nonviolent political

2:08:49.360 --> 2:08:53.280
 change, right? This is true for understanding calculus, right? I mean, everything requires

2:08:53.280 --> 2:08:56.560
 a struggle. We're back to talking about faculty hiring. At the end of the day,

2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:01.600
 in the end of the day, it all comes down to faculty hiring. All a metaphor. Faculty

2:09:01.600 --> 2:09:10.400
 hiring is a metaphor for all of life. Let me ask a strange question. Do you think everything is

2:09:10.400 --> 2:09:16.640
 going to be okay in the next year? Do you have a hope that we're going to be okay?

2:09:16.640 --> 2:09:20.560
 I tend to think that everything's going to be okay because I just tend to think that everything's

2:09:20.560 --> 2:09:26.240
 going to be okay. My mother says something to me a lot and always has, and I find it quite

2:09:26.240 --> 2:09:32.080
 comforting, which is this too shall pass and this too shall pass. Now, this too shall pass is not

2:09:32.080 --> 2:09:38.480
 just this bad thing is going away. Everything passes. I mean, I have a 16 year old daughter

2:09:38.480 --> 2:09:43.920
 who's going to go to college probably at about 15 minutes, given how fast she seems to be growing

2:09:43.920 --> 2:09:48.720
 up. And you know, I get to hang out with her now, but one day I won't. She'll ignore me just as much

2:09:48.720 --> 2:09:52.160
 as I ignored my parents when I was in college and went to grad school. This too shall pass.

2:09:52.160 --> 2:09:57.600
 But I think that one day, if we're all lucky, you live long enough to look back on something that

2:09:57.600 --> 2:10:06.080
 happened a while ago, even if it was painful and mostly it's a memory. So yes, I think it'll be okay.

2:10:06.080 --> 2:10:11.360
 What about humans? Do you think we'll live into the 21st century?

2:10:11.360 --> 2:10:12.560
 I certainly hope so.

2:10:12.560 --> 2:10:19.920
 Are you worried that we might destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons, with AGI, with engineering?

2:10:19.920 --> 2:10:24.000
 I'm not worried about AGI doing it, but I am worried. I mean, at any given moment, right? Also,

2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:28.640
 but you know, at any given moment, a comet could, I mean, you know, whatever. I tend to think that

2:10:28.640 --> 2:10:36.240
 outside of things completely beyond our control, we have a better chance than not of making it.

2:10:36.800 --> 2:10:41.920
 You know, I talked to Alex Filipenko from Berkeley. He was talking about comets and

2:10:41.920 --> 2:10:49.040
 that they can come out of nowhere. And that was a realization to me. Wow. We're just watching

2:10:49.040 --> 2:10:52.480
 this darkness and they can just enter. And then we have less than a month.

2:10:53.680 --> 2:10:56.000
 And yet you make it from day to day.

2:10:57.760 --> 2:11:01.520
 That one shall not pass. Well, maybe for Earth they'll pass, but not for humans.

2:11:02.160 --> 2:11:08.720
 But I'm just choosing to believe that it's going to be okay. And we're not going to get hit by

2:11:08.720 --> 2:11:13.280
 an asteroid, at least not while I'm around. And if we are, well, there's very little I can do about

2:11:13.280 --> 2:11:17.680
 it. So I might as well assume it's not going to happen. It makes food taste better.

2:11:17.680 --> 2:11:18.960
 It makes food taste better.

2:11:19.680 --> 2:11:24.240
 So you, out of the millions of things you've done in your life,

2:11:24.240 --> 2:11:28.400
 you've also began the This Week in Black History calendar of facts.

2:11:30.640 --> 2:11:34.560
 There's like a million questions that can ask here. You said you're not a historian,

2:11:35.760 --> 2:11:44.240
 but is there, let's start at the big history question of, is there somebody in history,

2:11:44.240 --> 2:11:50.960
 in black history that you draw a lot of philosophical or personal inspiration from,

2:11:50.960 --> 2:11:54.480
 or you just find interesting or a moment in history you find interesting?

2:11:55.040 --> 2:12:01.360
 Well, I find the entirety of the 40s to the 60s and the civil rights movement that didn't happen

2:12:01.360 --> 2:12:07.440
 and did happen at the same time during then quite inspirational. I mean, I've read quite a bit of the

2:12:07.440 --> 2:12:12.000
 time period, at least I did in my younger days when I had more time to read as many things as I

2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:22.000
 wanted to. What was quirky about This Week in Black History when I started in the 80s was how

2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:25.280
 focused it was. It was because of the sources I was stealing from. And I was very much stealing

2:12:25.280 --> 2:12:29.040
 from sort of like, I'd take calendars, anything I could find, Google didn't exist, right? And I

2:12:29.040 --> 2:12:32.320
 just pulled as much as I could and just put it together in one place for other people.

2:12:32.320 --> 2:12:36.080
 What ended up being quirky about it, and I started getting people sending me information on it,

2:12:36.080 --> 2:12:43.120
 was the inventors. People who, you know, Gerard Morgan to Benjamin Banneker, right? People who

2:12:43.120 --> 2:12:54.080
 were inventing things. At a time when, how in the world did they manage to invent anything?

2:12:54.080 --> 2:12:57.600
 Like, all these other things were happening, mother necessity, right? All these other things

2:12:57.600 --> 2:13:00.960
 were happening. And, you know, there were so many terrible things happening around them. And, you

2:13:00.960 --> 2:13:04.160
 know, they went to the wrong state at the wrong time. They may never, never come back, but they

2:13:04.160 --> 2:13:10.080
 were inventing things we use, right? And it was always inspiring to me that people would still

2:13:10.080 --> 2:13:16.560
 create even under those circumstances. I got a lot out of that. I also learned a few lessons. I

2:13:16.560 --> 2:13:23.680
 think, you know, the Charles Richard Drews of the world, you know, you create things that impact

2:13:23.680 --> 2:13:29.280
 people. You don't necessarily get credit for them. And that's not right, but it's also okay.

2:13:29.280 --> 2:13:31.080
 TK You okay with that?

2:13:31.080 --> 2:13:35.920
 CK Up to a point, yeah. I mean, look, in our world,

2:13:36.880 --> 2:13:38.320
 all we really have is credit.

2:13:38.320 --> 2:13:43.520
 TK I was always bothered by how much value credit is given.

2:13:43.520 --> 2:13:46.960
 CK That's the only thing you got. I mean, if you're an academic in some sense,

2:13:46.960 --> 2:13:49.360
 well, it isn't the only thing you've got, but it feels that way sometimes.

2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:56.160
 TK But you got the actual, we're all going to be dead soon. You got the joy of having created

2:13:56.160 --> 2:14:05.200
 the, you know, the credit with Jan. I've talked to Jorgen Schmidhuber, right? The Turing Award

2:14:05.200 --> 2:14:10.880
 given to three people for deep learning. And you could say that a lot of other people should be on

2:14:10.880 --> 2:14:16.320
 that list. It's the Nobel Prize question. Yeah, it's sad. It's sad. And people like talking about

2:14:16.320 --> 2:14:22.560
 it. But I feel like in the long arc of history, the only person who will be remembered is Einstein,

2:14:22.560 --> 2:14:27.040
 Hitler, maybe Elon Musk. And the rest of us are just like...

2:14:27.040 --> 2:14:31.040
 CK Well, you know, someone asked me about immortality once and I said,

2:14:31.040 --> 2:14:33.520
 and I stole this from somebody else. I don't remember who, but it was,

2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:39.920
 you know, I asked them, what's your great grandfather's name? Any of them? Of course,

2:14:39.920 --> 2:14:44.960
 they don't know. Most of us do not know. I mean, I'm not entirely sure. I know my grandparents,

2:14:44.960 --> 2:14:48.560
 all my grandparents names. I know what I called them, right? I don't know their middle names,

2:14:48.560 --> 2:14:54.640
 for example. It's within living memory, so I could find out. Actually, my grandfather

2:14:54.640 --> 2:15:00.480
 didn't know when he was born. I had no idea how old he was, right? But I definitely don't know

2:15:00.480 --> 2:15:06.400
 any of my great grandparents are. So in some sense, immortality is doing something preferably

2:15:06.400 --> 2:15:11.600
 positive so that your great grandchildren know who you are, right? And that's kind of what you

2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:16.720
 can hope for, which is very depressing in some ways. I could turn it into something uplifting

2:15:16.720 --> 2:15:23.200
 if you need me to, but it's simple, right? It doesn't matter. I don't have to know my great

2:15:23.200 --> 2:15:28.400
 grandfather was to know that I wouldn't be here without him. And I don't know who my great

2:15:28.400 --> 2:15:32.240
 grandchildren are. Certainly my great, great grandchildren are, and I'll probably never meet

2:15:32.240 --> 2:15:38.080
 them. Although I would very much like to, but hopefully I'll set the world in motion in such

2:15:38.080 --> 2:15:41.440
 a way that their lives will be better than they would have been if I hadn't done that. Well,

2:15:41.440 --> 2:15:44.320
 certainly they wouldn't have existed if I hadn't done the things that I did.

2:15:44.320 --> 2:15:48.240
 So I think that's a good positive thing you live on through other people.

2:15:49.280 --> 2:15:50.240
 Are you afraid of death?

2:15:51.200 --> 2:15:52.960
 I don't know if I'm afraid of death, but I don't like it.

2:15:54.960 --> 2:16:01.280
 That's another t shirt. I mean, do you ponder it? Do you think about the

2:16:02.720 --> 2:16:07.760
 inevitability of oblivion? I do occasionally. This feels like a very rushing conversation.

2:16:07.760 --> 2:16:14.320
 I will tell you a story, something that happened to me recently. If you look very carefully,

2:16:14.320 --> 2:16:20.560
 you will see I have a scar, which by the way, is an interesting story of its own about why people

2:16:20.560 --> 2:16:26.720
 have half of their thyroid taken out. Some people get scars and some don't. But anyway, I had half

2:16:26.720 --> 2:16:30.320
 my thyroid taken out. The way I got there, by the way, is its own interesting story, but I won't go

2:16:30.320 --> 2:16:33.760
 into it. Just suffice it to say, I did what I keep telling people you should never do, which is never

2:16:33.760 --> 2:16:36.720
 go to the doctor unless you have to, because there's nothing good that's ever going to come

2:16:36.720 --> 2:16:41.440
 out of a doctor's visit. So I went to the doctor to look at one thing. It's a little bump I had on

2:16:41.440 --> 2:16:45.600
 the side that I thought might be something bad because my mother made me. And I went there and

2:16:45.600 --> 2:16:49.120
 he's like, oh, it's nothing. But by the way, your thyroid is huge. Can you breathe? Yes,

2:16:49.120 --> 2:16:51.760
 I can breathe. Are you sure? Because it's pushing on your windpipe. You should be dead.

2:16:52.560 --> 2:16:59.520
 So I ended up going there. And to look at my thyroid, it was growing. I had what's called a

2:16:59.520 --> 2:17:03.920
 goiter. And he said, we're going to have to take it out at some point. When? Sometime before you're

2:17:03.920 --> 2:17:09.280
 85, probably. But if you wait till you're 85, that'll be really bad because you don't want to

2:17:09.280 --> 2:17:14.240
 have surgery when you're 85 years old, if you can help it. Certainly not the kind of surgery it

2:17:14.240 --> 2:17:21.040
 takes to take out your thyroid. So I went there and I would decide I would put it off until

2:17:21.680 --> 2:17:26.560
 December 19th because my birthday is December 18th. And I wouldn't be able to say I made it to

2:17:26.560 --> 2:17:32.640
 49 or whatever. So I said, I'll wait till after my birthday. In the first six months of that,

2:17:32.640 --> 2:17:39.120
 nothing changed. Apparently in the next three months, it had grown. I hadn't noticed this at

2:17:39.120 --> 2:17:44.480
 all. I went and had surgery. They took out half of it. The other half is still there and working

2:17:44.480 --> 2:17:49.520
 fine, by the way. I don't have to take a pill or anything like that. It's great. I'm in the

2:17:49.520 --> 2:17:56.880
 hospital room and the doctor comes in. I've got these things in my arm. They're going to do

2:17:56.880 --> 2:18:00.880
 whatever. They're talking to me. And the anesthesiologist says, huh, your blood

2:18:00.880 --> 2:18:04.880
 pressure is through the roof. Do you have high blood pressure? I said, no, but I'm terrified if

2:18:04.880 --> 2:18:10.560
 that helps you at all. And the anesthesist, who's the nurse who supports the anesthesiologist,

2:18:11.440 --> 2:18:15.040
 if I got that right, said, oh, don't worry about it. I've just put some stuff in your IV. You're

2:18:15.040 --> 2:18:18.240
 going to be feeling pretty good in a couple of minutes. And I remember turning and saying,

2:18:19.280 --> 2:18:23.680
 well, I'm going to feel pretty good in a couple of minutes. Next thing I know, there's this guy

2:18:23.680 --> 2:18:29.280
 and he's moving my bed. And he's talking to me and I have this distinct impression that I've met

2:18:29.280 --> 2:18:35.920
 this guy and I should know what he's talking about, but I kind of just don't remember what

2:18:35.920 --> 2:18:41.040
 just happened. And I look up and I see the tiles going by and I'm like, oh, it's just like in the

2:18:41.040 --> 2:18:47.680
 movies where you see the tiles go by. And then I have this brief thought that I'm in an infinitely

2:18:47.680 --> 2:18:53.280
 long warehouse and there's someone sitting next to me. And I remember thinking, oh, she's not

2:18:53.280 --> 2:19:00.960
 talking to me. And then I'm back in the hospital bed. And in between the time where the tiles were

2:19:00.960 --> 2:19:05.520
 going by and I got in the hospital bed, something like five hours had passed. Apparently it had

2:19:05.520 --> 2:19:09.760
 grown so much that it was a four and a half hour procedure instead of an hour long procedure. I

2:19:09.760 --> 2:19:15.280
 lost a neck size and a half. It was pretty big. Apparently it was as big as my heart.

2:19:16.560 --> 2:19:19.120
 Why am I telling you this? I'm telling you this because...

2:19:19.120 --> 2:19:25.920
 It's a hell of a story already. Between tiles going by and me waking up in

2:19:25.920 --> 2:19:30.880
 my hospital bed, no time passed. There was no sensation of time passing.

2:19:31.840 --> 2:19:36.960
 When I go to sleep and I wake up in the morning, I have this feeling that time has passed. This

2:19:36.960 --> 2:19:42.320
 feeling that something has physically changed about me. Nothing happened between the time they

2:19:42.320 --> 2:19:47.440
 put the magic juice in me and the time that I woke up. Nothing. By the way, my wife was there

2:19:47.440 --> 2:19:53.120
 with me talking. Apparently I was also talking. I don't remember any of this, but luckily I didn't

2:19:53.120 --> 2:19:58.480
 say anything I wouldn't normally say. My memory of it is I would talk to her and she would teleport

2:19:58.480 --> 2:20:02.640
 around the room. And then I accused her of witchcraft and that was the end of that.

2:20:03.760 --> 2:20:07.760
 Her point of view is I would start talking and then I would fall asleep and then I would wake

2:20:07.760 --> 2:20:10.880
 up and leave off where I was before. I had no notion of any time passing.

2:20:10.880 --> 2:20:20.400
 I kind of imagine that that's death, is the lack of sensation of time passing. And on the one hand,

2:20:20.400 --> 2:20:28.720
 I am, I don't know, soothed by the idea that I won't notice. On the other hand, I'm very unhappy

2:20:28.720 --> 2:20:35.680
 at the idea that I won't notice. So I don't know if I'm afraid of death, but I'm completely sure

2:20:35.680 --> 2:20:41.520
 that I don't like it and that I particularly would prefer to discover on my own whether immortality

2:20:41.520 --> 2:20:47.040
 sucks and be able to make a decision about it. That's what I would prefer. You like to have a

2:20:47.040 --> 2:20:51.440
 choice in the matter. I would like to have a choice in the matter. Well, again, on the Russian thing,

2:20:51.440 --> 2:20:57.680
 I think the finiteness of it is the thing that gives it a little flavor, a little spice. Well,

2:20:57.680 --> 2:21:00.640
 in reinforcement learning, we believe that. That's why we have discount factors. Otherwise,

2:21:00.640 --> 2:21:08.080
 it doesn't matter what you do. Amen. Well, let me, one last question sticking on the Russian theme.

2:21:09.280 --> 2:21:16.400
 You talked about your great grandparents not remembering their name. What do you think is the,

2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:26.000
 in this kind of Markov chain that is life, what do you think is the meaning of it all?

2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:32.000
 What's the meaning of life? Well, in a world where eventually you won't know who your great

2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:42.000
 grandchildren are, I'm reminded of something I heard once or I read once that I really like,

2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:51.760
 which is, it is well worth remembering that the entire universe, save for one trifling exception,

2:21:51.760 --> 2:21:58.080
 is composed entirely of others. And I think that's the meaning of life.

2:22:01.040 --> 2:22:06.240
 Charles, this is one of the best conversations I've ever had. And I get to see you tomorrow

2:22:06.240 --> 2:22:15.600
 again to hang out with who looks to be one of the most, how should I say, interesting personalities

2:22:15.600 --> 2:22:20.640
 that I'll ever get to meet with Michael Lippmann. So I can't wait. I'm excited to have had this

2:22:20.640 --> 2:22:25.920
 opportunity. Thank you for traveling all the way here. It was amazing. I'm excited. I always love

2:22:25.920 --> 2:22:30.960
 Georgia Tech. I'm excited to see with you being involved there what the future holds. So thank you

2:22:30.960 --> 2:22:34.800

 King Jr. There comes a time when people get tired of being pushed out of the glittering sunlight

2:23:30.720 --> 2:23:37.280
 of life's July and left standing amid the piercing chill of an alpine November.

2:23:37.280 --> 2:23:41.360
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
