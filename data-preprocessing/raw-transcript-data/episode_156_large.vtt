00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
 The following is a conversation with Tim Dillon,

00:03.040 --> 00:05.520
 a standup comedian who is fearless

00:05.520 --> 00:06.920
 in challenging the norms

00:06.920 --> 00:09.840
 of modern day social and political discourse.

00:09.840 --> 00:11.680
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:11.680 --> 00:14.120

00:34.880 --> 00:37.440
 As a side note, let me say that I will continue

00:37.440 --> 00:39.760
 talking to scientists, engineers, historians,

00:39.760 --> 00:41.720
 mathematicians, and so on.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.280
 But I will also talk to the people

00:44.280 --> 00:47.160
 who Jack Kerouac called the mad ones

00:47.160 --> 00:48.920
 in his book, On The Road.

00:48.920 --> 00:51.280
 That is one of my favorite books.

00:51.280 --> 00:55.040
 He wrote, the only people for me are the mad ones.

00:55.040 --> 00:56.920
 The ones who are mad to live,

00:56.920 --> 00:59.640
 mad to talk, mad to be saved,

00:59.640 --> 01:02.480
 desirous of everything at the same time.

01:02.480 --> 01:05.560
 The ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing,

01:05.560 --> 01:10.560
 but burn, burn, like fabulous yellow Roman candles

01:10.560 --> 01:13.640
 exploding like spiders across the stars.

01:13.640 --> 01:17.000
 And in the middle, you see the blue center light pop

01:17.000 --> 01:19.960
 and everybody goes, ah.

01:19.960 --> 01:23.600
 Some of these conversations will be a bit of a gamble

01:23.600 --> 01:26.520
 in that I have no idea how they will turn out.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.440
 But I'm willing to risk it for a chance

01:29.440 --> 01:31.080
 at a bit of an adventure.

01:31.080 --> 01:34.760
 And I'm happy and honored that Tim, this time,

01:34.760 --> 01:36.960
 wanted to take a chance as well.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.200

01:47.280 --> 01:50.560
 And now, here's my conversation with Tim Dillon.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.440
 What would you like your tombstone to read?

01:54.440 --> 01:58.840
 It's a good way to summarize the essence of a human being.

01:58.840 --> 02:01.520
 I would like it to say, this has not been paid for.

02:01.520 --> 02:02.480
 Yeah.

02:02.480 --> 02:07.480
 And I want my living relatives to struggle to pay for it.

02:08.320 --> 02:11.320
 And I think I would like them to be hounded every day.

02:11.320 --> 02:12.600
 I would like people to call and go, listen,

02:12.600 --> 02:14.680
 we don't wanna ever excavate a body,

02:14.680 --> 02:18.800
 but we will because this has not been paid for.

02:18.800 --> 02:22.520
 I love the idea of leaving the, like debt,

02:22.520 --> 02:24.720
 leaving the world in lots of debt

02:24.720 --> 02:26.880
 that other people have to deal with.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.080
 And I know people that have done that.

02:29.080 --> 02:30.480
 I know people that have been in families

02:30.480 --> 02:34.000
 where that's happened, where someone has to sit

02:34.000 --> 02:36.720
 and just curse the sky

02:36.720 --> 02:38.960
 because they don't have a physical person anymore

02:38.960 --> 02:42.280
 to be angry at, but they still have to deal

02:42.280 --> 02:44.080
 with the decisions that person made.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.320
 And that's deeply tragic,

02:45.320 --> 02:47.040
 but that's always struck me as very funny.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.400
 Well, it's a kind of immortality, the debt.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.080
 Because if the debt lasts for a long time,

02:52.080 --> 02:53.960
 the anger lasts for a long time.

02:53.960 --> 02:57.000
 And then you're now immortal in the minds of many.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.360
 You arouse emotion in the minds of many.

02:59.360 --> 03:01.840
 My mother's best friend in the town I grew up in,

03:01.840 --> 03:06.840
 her husband shot himself in the driveway.

03:07.080 --> 03:10.680
 And my mother's friend never got a chance to just grieve

03:10.680 --> 03:12.600
 because he owed so much money.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.400
 She would come over and go, I hate him.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.440
 I fucking hate him.

03:17.440 --> 03:18.760
 And it was just such an interesting thing

03:18.760 --> 03:21.480
 to see somebody who, and her kids ended up getting angry

03:21.480 --> 03:24.360
 at her for that because they didn't understand

03:24.360 --> 03:28.120
 why she would hate a guy who was clearly suffering.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.280
 But she goes, he took the selfish way out.

03:30.280 --> 03:31.720
 He fucked us.

03:31.720 --> 03:34.880
 And it was always interesting for me to just remember

03:34.880 --> 03:39.360
 that you can leave earth and still be a problem.

03:39.360 --> 03:43.360
 That's kind of a special person.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.520
 So that's, I think, what I'd like my tombstone to read.

03:45.520 --> 03:48.520
 Yeah, there's a show called Louis with Louis C.K.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.520
 I don't know if you watched it.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.480
 I'm aware of it.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.480
 There's this moment, I think, where an old guy's talking

03:53.480 --> 03:56.880
 to Louis about the best part about love

03:56.880 --> 03:58.480
 is after you break up.

03:58.480 --> 04:03.480
 And it's remembering the good times and feeling that loss,

04:05.680 --> 04:07.160
 the pain of that loss.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.400
 The worst part about love is when you no longer

04:09.400 --> 04:10.480
 feel that pain.

04:10.480 --> 04:15.480
 So the pain of losing somebody lasts longer,

04:15.680 --> 04:18.600
 is more intense and lasts longer than the actual love.

04:18.600 --> 04:23.480
 So his argument was like the pain is what love really is.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.320
 Wow.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.080
 In the same way that anger,

04:26.080 --> 04:30.600
 your tombstone would arouse will last longer.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.440
 And that's deeply like a human thing.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.320
 Like why do we attach happiness

04:36.320 --> 04:38.560
 to the way we should remember others?

04:38.560 --> 04:40.560
 It could be just anger.

04:40.560 --> 04:43.240
 I know so many people who will have

04:43.240 --> 04:45.840
 deeply complicated feelings when...

04:45.840 --> 04:49.200
 I did drugs for many years and I spent time

04:49.200 --> 04:50.680
 with some wild people.

04:50.680 --> 04:53.240
 And their parents were also wild people.

04:53.240 --> 04:58.120
 And some of their parents have done crazy things to them.

04:58.120 --> 05:03.120
 And have created situations that were not productive

05:04.640 --> 05:06.560
 for child rearing.

05:06.560 --> 05:09.120
 And so I know that when those people die,

05:09.120 --> 05:11.520
 it's going to be a very mixed bag.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.640
 Like there's going to be a lot of complex emotions.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.600
 Like, hey, we loved that guy.

05:16.600 --> 05:21.320
 But also when we look back, he was a horrible father,

05:21.320 --> 05:24.200
 a horrible husband, but he was fun.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.480
 And we don't put enough stock in that,

05:27.480 --> 05:29.360
 but that will be a push and pull.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.960
 And I'll be the one kind of bringing up like,

05:30.960 --> 05:33.120
 hey, he was a lot of fun.

05:33.120 --> 05:33.960
 He was a lot.

05:33.960 --> 05:36.440
 Remember when he stuck us,

05:36.440 --> 05:39.200
 one of the things this particular person I'm talking about,

05:39.200 --> 05:41.720
 we were at a bar and me and my friend were there,

05:41.720 --> 05:42.560
 we're having dinner.

05:42.560 --> 05:45.600
 And his father, who was an alcoholic,

05:45.600 --> 05:49.360
 a guy that would go out every night and didn't work,

05:49.360 --> 05:52.520
 refused to work, would lie and say he was going to work

05:52.520 --> 05:53.480
 and then go to a bar.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.760
 I mean, just a fun person.

05:55.760 --> 06:00.120
 And we were sitting at this bar restaurant

06:00.120 --> 06:02.240
 and the bartender, we see his father walk up

06:02.240 --> 06:06.120
 to the bartender and say, point at us, point at our table

06:06.120 --> 06:07.560
 and go and put the thumbs up.

06:07.560 --> 06:08.960
 And the bartender nodded.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.840
 And then the father walked over to our table and he said,

06:10.840 --> 06:13.360
 listen, I just want to let you know I just bought you dinner.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.320
 And I looked at his son and I said, he's a pretty good guy.

06:17.320 --> 06:20.360
 And then he climbed over the little fence down to the water

06:20.360 --> 06:21.200
 and got in his little boat.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.600
 It was a little cigarette boat and he just drove away.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.400
 And then about an hour later, we went and we said,

06:26.400 --> 06:28.840
 I think that guy took care of the bill.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.480
 But she said, well, go talk to the bartender.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.840
 So we talked to the bartender and he goes,

06:32.840 --> 06:36.400
 he handed us a bill and the bill was for like $1,000.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.320
 And we said, wait a minute, what the hell's going on?

06:38.320 --> 06:40.680
 And he goes, the guy that left an hour ago said,

06:40.680 --> 06:42.040
 you were going to take care of his bill.

06:42.040 --> 06:44.240
 He's been drinking here all week.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.000
 And we go, what are you talking about?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.840
 And he goes, remember, he pointed at you.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.520
 He put the thumbs up and you guys waved.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.240
 You remember that?

06:52.240 --> 06:53.680
 And the guy go, and we went, yeah.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.680
 And I just looked at my friends, my friend and I went,

06:55.680 --> 06:57.280
 you know, your dad is just,

06:57.280 --> 07:00.040
 we're going to remember him for all kinds of reasons.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.480
 But to you, he was fun.

07:01.480 --> 07:02.320
 He was a lot of fun.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.480
 He wasn't my dad, but I spent a lot of time with him.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.440
 I was in two boating accidents with him.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.880
 You know, two boating accidents.

07:08.880 --> 07:10.080
 Alcohol involved, drugs involved.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.880
 Yes, he was, usually alcohol was involved

07:11.880 --> 07:15.840
 when he left his house and when he was at home as well.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.240
 But I was in two boating accidents.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.880
 And do you know how fun someone has to be

07:19.880 --> 07:21.760
 to get in a second boating accident?

07:22.720 --> 07:25.840
 Do you know what a good time someone has to be

07:25.840 --> 07:27.680
 to get in a boat with them

07:27.680 --> 07:30.680
 after you've already gotten in one wreck?

07:30.680 --> 07:31.680
 Never get fooled again.

07:31.680 --> 07:32.520
 What was that line?

07:32.520 --> 07:34.400
 George Bush, never get fooled again.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.360
 Right.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.320
 Yeah, so if you're getting fooled again,

07:37.320 --> 07:38.200
 you know, there's a reason for it,

07:38.200 --> 07:39.560
 but he was a fun guy.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.520
 He did have a death wish.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.200
 The second boating accident, he grabbed me

07:42.200 --> 07:43.480
 and said, you can't hang out with me anymore.

07:43.480 --> 07:44.320
 And I said, why?

07:44.320 --> 07:45.800
 He goes, I'm trying to kill myself.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.000
 And I was like, oh.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.760
 And then I understood that like all of the fun

07:49.760 --> 07:52.960
 under the fun lived a very destructive person

07:52.960 --> 07:56.380
 who not only was destructive, but wanted to die.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.920
 So speaking of fun people that want to die,

07:59.920 --> 08:02.680
 I don't know if you're, we can go Hunter S. Thompson,

08:02.680 --> 08:05.080
 but Charles Bukowski.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.400
 I don't know if you're aware of the guy.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.320
 I'm aware of him, sure.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.880
 I've read some of his stuff.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.840
 So his tombstone says,

08:10.840 --> 08:12.480
 I just want to ask you a question about it.

08:12.480 --> 08:15.420
 His tombstone says, don't try.

08:15.420 --> 08:16.620
 Interesting.

08:16.620 --> 08:18.280
 What do you think about that advice

08:18.280 --> 08:19.960
 as a way to approach life?

08:19.960 --> 08:23.200
 I think for many people, it's a good advice

08:24.080 --> 08:26.960
 because the people that are going to try will do anyway.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.280
 And the people that need to be told,

08:28.280 --> 08:30.240
 there's a whole cottage industry now

08:30.240 --> 08:35.080
 of motivational speakers and life coaches and gurus

08:35.080 --> 08:39.880
 that tell people that they all have to own their own business

08:39.880 --> 08:42.880
 and be their own boss and be a disruptor

08:42.880 --> 08:45.160
 and get into industries.

08:45.160 --> 08:47.440
 That's incredibly unrealistic for most people.

08:47.440 --> 08:50.140
 Most people are not suited for that.

08:50.140 --> 08:52.680
 And the Gary Vees of the world that tell everybody

08:52.680 --> 08:54.100
 that they should just hustle and grind

08:54.100 --> 08:54.940
 and hustle and grind.

08:54.940 --> 08:56.060
 They're very light on the specifics

08:56.060 --> 08:58.120
 of what they should actually do.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.720
 Yeah, I think a lot of people,

08:59.720 --> 09:02.080
 that's not horrible advice to give to a lot of people.

09:02.080 --> 09:05.160
 I think my generation got horrible advice

09:05.160 --> 09:07.600
 from our parents, from our teachers.

09:07.600 --> 09:11.360
 And that advice was follow your dreams and nobody,

09:11.360 --> 09:12.200
 and that was it, by the way.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.480
 There was no like, what are your dreams?

09:14.480 --> 09:15.620
 Are they realistic?

09:15.620 --> 09:17.240
 What happens when they don't work out?

09:17.240 --> 09:18.740
 Will your dreams make you happy?

09:18.740 --> 09:20.820
 Are your dreams real?

09:20.820 --> 09:22.600
 Do they exist on earth?

09:22.600 --> 09:25.680
 Can you follow, anybody follow your dreams?

09:25.680 --> 09:26.800
 You can be anything you want to be.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.080
 Horrible advice, horrible advice.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.640
 Worst advice you could ever give a generation of people.

09:31.640 --> 09:32.760
 Really, truly.

09:32.760 --> 09:35.000
 I mean, think about it.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.160
 If you were talking to somebody

09:37.160 --> 09:39.200
 and you were trying to make them succeed,

09:39.200 --> 09:43.560
 are there any two worse pieces of advice to give them

09:43.560 --> 09:46.160
 than follow your dreams

09:46.160 --> 09:48.640
 and you can be anything you want to be?

09:48.640 --> 09:51.840
 Those to me are the two most destructive pieces

09:51.840 --> 09:53.160
 of information I've ever heard.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.800
 So let me push back because.

09:54.800 --> 09:55.640
 Okay, that's fair.

09:55.640 --> 09:57.840
 This is. Many people do.

09:57.840 --> 10:01.840
 So yeah, this is like a rigorous journalistic interview.

10:01.840 --> 10:04.040
 Larry King, by the way, passed away today.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.600
 So I'm taking over the.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.440
 It's very sad.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.260
 I'm carrying the.

10:07.260 --> 10:08.100
 It's very sad.

10:08.100 --> 10:09.680
 RIP King.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.200
 Yeah, what was I even gonna say?

10:11.200 --> 10:14.640
 Oh, let me push back on the follow your dream thing

10:14.640 --> 10:18.260
 is I come from an immigrant family

10:18.260 --> 10:23.160
 where I was always working extremely hard at stuff,

10:23.160 --> 10:24.560
 like in a stupid way.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.800
 I would, I love, there's something about me

10:26.800 --> 10:28.600
 that loves hitting my head against the wall

10:28.600 --> 10:31.440
 over and over and over until either my head breaks

10:31.440 --> 10:32.360
 or the wall breaks.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.680
 Just like, I love that dedication

10:34.680 --> 10:36.200
 for no purpose whatsoever.

10:36.200 --> 10:39.040
 It's like the mouse that's stuck in a cage or whatever.

10:39.040 --> 10:42.320
 And no, and everybody always told me,

10:42.320 --> 10:45.020
 my family, the people around me,

10:45.020 --> 10:48.880
 the sort of the epitome of what I could achieve

10:48.880 --> 10:52.000
 is to be kind of a stable job.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.720
 You know, the old like lawyer doctor,

10:54.720 --> 10:57.720
 in my case, it's like scientists and so on.

10:57.720 --> 11:00.520
 But I had these dreams at this fire, you know,

11:00.520 --> 11:03.400
 about love robots.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.700
 And that nobody ever gave me permission

11:06.700 --> 11:08.360
 to pursue those dreams.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.240
 I know you're supposed to grab it yourself.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.000
 Nobody's supposed to give you permission,

11:12.000 --> 11:16.760
 but there's something about just people saying, you know,

11:16.760 --> 11:18.720
 fuck what everyone else thinks,

11:18.720 --> 11:20.520
 like giving you permission, a parent

11:20.520 --> 11:23.480
 or somebody like that saying, do your own thing.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.480
 Go become an actor, go become like,

11:25.480 --> 11:27.120
 do the crazy thing you're not supposed to do,

11:27.120 --> 11:30.820
 an artist, go build a company, quit school,

11:30.820 --> 11:31.960
 all that kind of stuff.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.200
 Yes, sure.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.140
 That's the push back against the,

11:36.040 --> 11:38.640
 follow your dreams as bad advice.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.540
 In mass, if you were to look at,

11:40.540 --> 11:43.160
 in mass, if you were to look at statistically

11:43.160 --> 11:45.360
 how few people that works out for,

11:45.360 --> 11:46.920
 I'm just, no, but let's be very honest.

11:46.920 --> 11:47.760
 That's very true.

11:47.760 --> 11:48.580
 Be very honest.

11:48.580 --> 11:50.520
 So I mean like, yeah, if you're gonna go be an,

11:50.520 --> 11:52.920
 hey, I was broke for 10 years before I became a,

11:52.920 --> 11:54.600
 before I was making money as a comedian.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.840
 I get it.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.360
 I didn't need Gary Vaynerchuk

11:57.360 --> 11:59.720
 to tell me to follow my thing, right?

11:59.720 --> 12:00.560
 And here's the other thing.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.400
 I was kind of funny and like,

12:02.400 --> 12:06.640
 I was kind of, a lot of things were in my favor

12:06.640 --> 12:07.720
 of being a comedian, right?

12:07.720 --> 12:09.080
 I had this kind of crazy fucked up life.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.500
 I had a lot of stories.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.920
 I had exhausted, I was willing to fail.

12:12.920 --> 12:14.680
 I had failed before.

12:14.680 --> 12:15.540
 I was broke.

12:15.540 --> 12:16.960
 I didn't care about being broke.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.700
 I knew how to be broke.

12:18.700 --> 12:21.360
 I had, I was shameless to a degree.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.560
 I was, I would get on a stage night after night

12:23.560 --> 12:24.880
 and be laughed at.

12:24.880 --> 12:28.040
 I would, I had a high threshold for being embarrassed.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.880
 I had a high threshold for people thinking

12:29.880 --> 12:31.840
 that I was a scumbag, right?

12:31.840 --> 12:33.640
 And showing up at family parties and being like,

12:33.640 --> 12:35.320
 yeah, I still really don't have a job.

12:35.320 --> 12:38.600
 And I'm just, I work at comedy clubs kind of,

12:38.600 --> 12:40.000
 and I get booked when I can.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.520
 And I was, you know, suited for it.

12:44.520 --> 12:48.040
 There's this idea that people can just roam

12:48.040 --> 12:53.040
 around the world injecting themselves into other things

12:53.680 --> 12:56.400
 they have no aptitude for at all.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.240
 And will that to happen?

12:58.240 --> 13:01.080
 A small percentage of people might be able to do that,

13:01.080 --> 13:04.140
 but the vast majority of people have something

13:04.140 --> 13:06.760
 they might key into that they're meant to do.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.280
 Like you loved robots, you love technology,

13:09.280 --> 13:12.800
 and you found a place in that world where you thrive.

13:12.800 --> 13:16.140
 But I think many people, a lot of people love robots, right?

13:16.140 --> 13:18.440
 So a lot of people think everything you do is interesting.

13:18.440 --> 13:20.160
 I think your shit is fascinating.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.600
 I watch you or podcasts, and I think it's very interesting.

13:23.600 --> 13:26.240
 I have no place in your world.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.320
 You know what I mean?

13:27.320 --> 13:29.000
 I have no place in that world.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.960
 I don't like remedial math.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.400
 I don't like community college math.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.280
 I think it's a waste of my time.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.280
 What do you think about robot?

13:38.280 --> 13:40.560
 Would you ever buy a robot for your home?

13:40.560 --> 13:41.700
 Yes.

13:41.700 --> 13:43.140
 What will it do?

13:43.140 --> 13:44.880
 I'd be a companion, a friend.

13:44.880 --> 13:47.040
 Oh yeah, I mean, I would like to start replacing friends

13:47.040 --> 13:49.040
 and family with robots immediately.

13:49.040 --> 13:51.280
 I mean, truly, truly.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.620
 I mean, I'm not even kidding.

13:52.620 --> 13:57.000
 Like I would like to have a Thanksgiving with four robots.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.920
 I'm dead serious.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.040
 Are they into QAnon?

14:00.040 --> 14:05.040
 Like are the robots, when do the robots start going crazy?

14:05.720 --> 14:08.160
 That's my question is like, how long do the robots

14:08.160 --> 14:10.640
 live with me before they are also a problem

14:10.640 --> 14:12.520
 and I got to replace them?

14:12.520 --> 14:13.480
 You know what I mean?

14:13.480 --> 14:15.440
 You're gonna indoctrinate the robot.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.120
 The robot's gonna call me like my aunt does

14:17.120 --> 14:19.520
 and talk about coronavirus for an hour every morning

14:19.520 --> 14:22.940
 and tell me everyone in America who's died of coronavirus.

14:22.940 --> 14:25.760
 One of the things I enjoy in life

14:25.760 --> 14:29.200
 is how terrified people like you,

14:29.200 --> 14:32.360
 I'm a huge fan by the way, get a robot.

14:32.360 --> 14:34.920
 Well, I'm concerned about AI

14:36.400 --> 14:39.640
 completely getting rid of the need for human beings

14:39.640 --> 14:41.840
 because human beings, I mean, usually you go out

14:41.840 --> 14:43.480
 in the street and you go,

14:43.480 --> 14:46.880
 so few of these people are necessary, even now.

14:46.880 --> 14:49.200
 Even now you look at people and you go,

14:49.200 --> 14:51.040
 they're hanging on by a thread, right?

14:51.040 --> 14:52.840
 And you can just imagine how many jobs

14:52.840 --> 14:55.360
 are gonna get replaced, how many industries

14:55.360 --> 14:58.640
 are going to be completely remade with AI

14:58.640 --> 15:01.720
 and the pace of change worries me a little bit

15:01.720 --> 15:04.320
 because we do a very bad job in this country

15:04.320 --> 15:07.520
 of mitigation when we have problems.

15:07.520 --> 15:08.600
 We don't do a great job.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.160
 We did not great job with COVID, right?

15:11.160 --> 15:12.000
 We don't do a good job.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.920
 It's just something we don't do well.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.800
 We're good in booms and busts.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.080
 We're good when it's good.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.240
 And we're actually, we kind of know how to kind of like,

15:19.240 --> 15:20.580
 hey, we're bottomed out.

15:20.580 --> 15:22.800
 We're like a gambling addict in this country.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.800
 We like, we know what it feels like

15:24.800 --> 15:26.680
 to be outside of an OTB at 9 a.m.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.440
 drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes going,

15:28.440 --> 15:29.800
 I'm gonna build it back.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.560
 And we know what it's like to win,

15:31.560 --> 15:35.660
 but anything in between, it seems not that great.

15:35.660 --> 15:38.200
 So to me, it feels like are we gonna be able

15:38.200 --> 15:41.680
 to like help people that are displaced

15:41.680 --> 15:43.720
 and that have their jobs taken by,

15:43.720 --> 15:47.160
 I mean, do you not fear sort of a world

15:47.160 --> 15:50.800
 where you have a lot of artificial intelligence

15:50.800 --> 15:53.280
 replacing workers and then what happens?

15:53.280 --> 15:56.040
 There's a lot of fears around artificial intelligence.

15:56.040 --> 15:59.440
 One of them is, yes, displacement of jobs, workers.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.280
 That's technology in general.

16:01.280 --> 16:06.280
 That's just any kind of new innovations displace jobs.

16:06.280 --> 16:09.360
 I'm less worried about that.

16:09.360 --> 16:10.840
 I'm more worried about other impacts

16:10.840 --> 16:11.840
 of artificial intelligence.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.720
 For example, the nature of our discourse,

16:13.720 --> 16:15.880
 like social, the effects of algorithms

16:15.880 --> 16:17.840
 on the way we communicate with each other,

16:17.840 --> 16:19.680
 the spread of information,

16:19.680 --> 16:21.280
 what that information looks like,

16:21.280 --> 16:23.960
 the creation of silos, all that kind of stuff.

16:23.960 --> 16:27.520
 I think that would just make worse

16:27.520 --> 16:32.040
 the effects that the displacement of jobs has.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.640
 I think ultimately, I have a hope

16:34.640 --> 16:36.720
 that technology creates more opportunities

16:36.720 --> 16:37.760
 than it destroys.

16:37.760 --> 16:38.880
 I hope so too.

16:38.880 --> 16:43.880
 So in that sense, AI to me is an exciting possibility,

16:44.360 --> 16:48.880
 but the challenges this world presents

16:48.880 --> 16:52.000
 will create divisions, will create chaos and so on.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.120
 So I'm more focused on the way we deal

16:55.120 --> 16:56.680
 as a society with that chaos,

16:56.680 --> 16:57.960
 the way we talk to each other.

16:57.960 --> 16:58.800
 That's huge.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.680
 Creating the platform that's healthy for that.

17:00.680 --> 17:03.480
 Now, as a comedian creator,

17:03.480 --> 17:04.680
 whatever you want to call it,

17:04.680 --> 17:07.760
 people that put out content,

17:07.760 --> 17:10.280
 the gatekeepers are now algorithmic, right?

17:10.280 --> 17:12.360
 So they are kind of almost AI ready.

17:12.360 --> 17:16.680
 So if you are a person that puts out YouTube videos,

17:16.680 --> 17:19.160
 podcasts, whatever you're doing,

17:20.560 --> 17:24.360
 it used to be a guy in the back of the room with a cigar

17:24.360 --> 17:27.400
 saying, I like you or get him out of here.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.640
 Now, it's an algorithm you barely understand.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.160
 I've talked to people at YouTube,

17:32.160 --> 17:34.840
 but I don't know if they understand the algorithm.

17:34.840 --> 17:35.680
 They don't.

17:35.680 --> 17:36.520
 They don't.

17:36.520 --> 17:37.360
 This is fascinating.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.440
 Yeah, it's fascinating.

17:38.440 --> 17:39.880
 Because I speak to people at YouTube and I go,

17:39.880 --> 17:41.200
 hey, man, what's going on here?

17:41.200 --> 17:43.560
 One of my episode titles of my podcast

17:43.560 --> 17:45.720
 was called Knife Fight in Malibu.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.720
 It was about real estate.

17:47.720 --> 17:50.040
 And it was because a realtor in Malibu,

17:50.040 --> 17:51.320
 I was trying to get a summer rental,

17:51.320 --> 17:52.320
 which I can't really afford,

17:52.320 --> 17:55.080
 but I don't think that's a huge problem.

17:55.080 --> 17:56.720
 I follow my dreams.

17:56.720 --> 17:59.080
 So I called a realtor and she said, listen,

17:59.080 --> 18:01.000
 she goes, I don't know what the government's saying,

18:01.000 --> 18:03.280
 but she goes, it's a real knife fight out here.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.040
 You know, an old grizzled woman, real realtor,

18:05.040 --> 18:08.640
 tanned skin, sig out the mouth, driving a Porsche.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.320
 It's a real knife fight out here.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.480
 Her entire life had become real estate.

18:12.480 --> 18:14.000
 Her soul had been hollowed out.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.720
 Her kids hate her.

18:15.720 --> 18:16.920
 No one's made her come in years,

18:16.920 --> 18:20.120
 but she just loves heated kitchen floors infused.

18:20.120 --> 18:20.960
 Fun.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.800
 She's a demon from hell and we need them, truly.

18:23.800 --> 18:24.920
 We're getting rid of them.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.120
 It's not good.

18:26.120 --> 18:27.920
 And she goes, it's a real knife fight out here.

18:27.920 --> 18:30.040
 So we put that in the episode title.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.960
 And of course, I guess some algorithm thought

18:31.960 --> 18:34.040
 that we were showing like people stabbing each other

18:34.040 --> 18:37.760
 in a Wendy's and we got like demonetized.

18:37.760 --> 18:38.960
 Did we get demonetized?

18:41.120 --> 18:42.240
 We lost a lot of views

18:42.240 --> 18:43.640
 because we were kicked out of whatever out,

18:43.640 --> 18:44.880
 like we're just kicked out.

18:44.880 --> 18:46.320
 And then I was asking YouTube about it.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.600
 They were kind of understanding it.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.320
 But even the people that work there

18:49.320 --> 18:51.840
 didn't truly seem to understand the algorithm.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.600
 So can you explain to me how that works

18:53.600 --> 18:55.240
 where they barely know what's going on?

18:55.240 --> 18:58.200
 No, they do not understand the full dynamics

18:58.200 --> 19:01.480
 of the monster or the amazing thing that they've created.

19:01.480 --> 19:04.520
 It's the amount of content that's being created

19:04.520 --> 19:06.320
 is larger than anyone understands.

19:06.320 --> 19:07.520
 Like this is huge.

19:07.520 --> 19:08.440
 They can't deal with it.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.800
 The teams aren't large enough to deal with it.

19:10.800 --> 19:13.120
 There's like special cases.

19:13.120 --> 19:15.560
 So if you fall into the category of special case,

19:15.560 --> 19:18.200
 so we can maybe talk about that, like a Donald Trump,

19:18.200 --> 19:20.080
 where you like actually have meetings

19:20.080 --> 19:22.240
 about what to do with this particular account.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.840
 But everything outside of that is all algorithms.

19:24.840 --> 19:27.400
 They get reported by people

19:27.400 --> 19:30.200
 and they get, like if enough people report

19:30.200 --> 19:32.680
 a particular video, a particular tweet,

19:32.680 --> 19:36.560
 it rises up to where humans look over it.

19:36.560 --> 19:40.840
 But the initial step of the reporting

19:40.840 --> 19:45.480
 and the rising up to the human supervision

19:45.480 --> 19:46.480
 is done by algorithm.

19:46.480 --> 19:48.280
 And they don't understand the dynamics of that

19:48.280 --> 19:50.440
 because we're talking about billions of tweets.

19:50.440 --> 19:55.400
 We're talking about hundreds of thousands of hours

19:55.400 --> 19:58.240
 of video uploaded every day.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.800
 Now, the hilarity of it

20:00.800 --> 20:04.720
 is that most of the YouTube algorithm

20:04.720 --> 20:07.200
 is based on the title.

20:08.360 --> 20:09.360
 That's crazy.

20:09.360 --> 20:11.560
 And the description is a small contribution

20:11.560 --> 20:12.520
 in terms of filtering,

20:12.520 --> 20:14.800
 in terms of the knife fight situation.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.080
 And that's all they can do.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.520
 They don't have algorithms at all

20:19.520 --> 20:22.440
 that are able to process the content of the video.

20:22.440 --> 20:26.040
 So they try to also infer information

20:26.040 --> 20:29.160
 based on if you're watching all of these QAnon videos

20:29.160 --> 20:32.240
 or something like that, or Flat Earth videos,

20:32.240 --> 20:35.800
 and you also watch, are really excitedly watching

20:35.800 --> 20:39.320
 the whole knife fight in Malibu video,

20:39.320 --> 20:42.320
 that says that increases the chance

20:42.320 --> 20:47.280
 that the knife fight is a dangerous video for society

20:47.280 --> 20:48.120
 or something like that.

20:48.120 --> 20:48.960
 Interesting, wow.

20:48.960 --> 20:49.800
 Based on their contribution.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.080
 So people are watching something,

20:52.080 --> 20:54.280
 because I watch QAnon and Flat Earth videos

20:54.280 --> 20:55.760
 to ridicule them.

20:55.760 --> 20:56.600
 Right.

20:56.600 --> 20:57.440
 That, you know what I mean?

20:57.440 --> 20:59.960
 I watch these videos and I make fun of them on my show.

20:59.960 --> 21:00.800
 But what's interesting is,

21:00.800 --> 21:03.200
 if I then go watch something else,

21:03.200 --> 21:04.560
 I'm increasing the likelihood

21:04.560 --> 21:06.120
 that that video is gonna get looked at

21:06.120 --> 21:07.920
 as potentially subversive or dangerous.

21:07.920 --> 21:08.760
 Exactly.

21:08.760 --> 21:09.600
 That's why.

21:09.600 --> 21:12.040
 So they make decisions about who you are,

21:12.040 --> 21:13.400
 who you are as a human being,

21:13.400 --> 21:15.000
 as a watcher, as a visual user,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.920
 based on the clusters of videos you're in.

21:17.920 --> 21:20.480
 But those clusters are not manually determined.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.200
 They're automatically clustered.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.600
 It's so weird.

21:24.600 --> 21:27.480
 We have titles where they got upset about,

21:27.480 --> 21:29.200
 I don't even understand.

21:29.200 --> 21:32.800
 Like we had a title that was so innocuous, in my opinion,

21:32.800 --> 21:36.120
 and the title of the episode was called Bomb Disney World.

21:36.120 --> 21:41.120
 And I was asking people to consider bombing Disney World.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.920
 And YouTube got angry at that.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.640
 So you don't know why.

21:45.640 --> 21:46.960
 You can never understand why.

21:46.960 --> 21:48.720
 You could have said Disney World is the bombs.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.440
 Right, right, right.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.040
 It's just rearranging.

21:52.040 --> 21:52.880
 That's what it probably meant.

21:52.880 --> 21:53.720
 I wasn't saying do it,

21:53.720 --> 21:58.440
 but I was saying let's start thinking about plans to do,

21:58.440 --> 22:01.800
 not let's do it, but let's get in the mind.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.840
 Let's change the conversation.

22:03.840 --> 22:05.880
 I think it's very interesting because as a comedian,

22:05.880 --> 22:06.920
 you don't wanna live in that world

22:06.920 --> 22:08.000
 of worrying about algorithms.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.320
 You don't wanna worry about deplatforming

22:09.320 --> 22:10.160
 and shadowbanning.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.440
 I mean, all these conversations

22:11.440 --> 22:13.480
 that I've had with other comedians about shadowbanning,

22:13.480 --> 22:14.360
 I mean, it's hilarious.

22:14.360 --> 22:16.720
 We all call each other, I think I'm being shadowbanned.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.280
 Are you being shadowbanned?

22:18.280 --> 22:20.640
 Nobody knew what that word was a month ago,

22:20.640 --> 22:21.640
 I mean, a year ago,

22:21.640 --> 22:24.280
 but everyone now is convinced that everything they do

22:24.280 --> 22:26.880
 that isn't succeeding is being shadowbanned.

22:26.880 --> 22:30.000
 So it's this new paranoia,

22:30.000 --> 22:33.240
 this algorithmic paranoia now that we all kinda have

22:33.240 --> 22:36.560
 because there are genuine instances

22:36.560 --> 22:39.480
 of people being taken out of an algorithm,

22:39.480 --> 22:41.360
 you know, rightly or wrongly,

22:41.360 --> 22:42.640
 however you wanna believe.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.600
 But then there are also things that just don't perform

22:44.600 --> 22:46.920
 as well for a myriad of reasons.

22:46.920 --> 22:50.520
 And then we're all saying like, well, they're against me.

22:50.520 --> 22:51.800
 They're shutting me down.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.920
 And you don't know if that's true or not, you know?

22:54.920 --> 22:57.400
 What do you think about this moment in history,

22:57.400 --> 22:59.800
 which was really troubling to me?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.760
 We could talk about several troubling aspects,

23:03.760 --> 23:08.760
 but one is Amazon removing Parler from AWS.

23:09.440 --> 23:13.640
 To me, that was the most clearly troubling.

23:13.640 --> 23:16.680
 It felt like it created a more dangerous world

23:16.680 --> 23:21.680
 when the infrastructure on which you have competing

23:23.080 --> 23:26.920
 medium of communications now puts its finger on the scale,

23:26.920 --> 23:30.520
 now influences who wins and who loses.

23:30.520 --> 23:32.560
 Absolutely, you're right.

23:32.560 --> 23:35.120
 And what you're always told is like,

23:35.120 --> 23:37.560
 if you don't like Twitter, create your own service.

23:37.560 --> 23:40.000
 Or if you don't like something, you can do your own thing.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
 Or if you are, and basically because, you know, tech,

23:45.000 --> 23:46.880
 you have to be in business with one of five companies.

23:46.880 --> 23:50.240
 And I think it's like Amazon, Facebook, Google, YouTube,

23:50.240 --> 23:51.920
 and Twitter, whatever, they're like, you know,

23:51.920 --> 23:54.080
 I mean, Amazon puts everything on the cloud,

23:54.080 --> 23:55.120
 you know, Google and YouTube,

23:55.120 --> 23:57.240
 it's all basically the SEO and the advertising.

23:57.240 --> 23:58.360
 And you got to get your name out there.

23:58.360 --> 23:59.880
 You don't wanna be buried in it.

23:59.880 --> 24:01.840
 Like, because you have to do business with it,

24:01.840 --> 24:03.440
 it's a cartel of these companies.

24:03.440 --> 24:05.760
 You understand it better than anybody

24:05.760 --> 24:07.800
 that you are prevented, truly.

24:07.800 --> 24:10.760
 And I think whatever you think about Parler,

24:10.760 --> 24:12.920
 whatever you think about what people are saying on Parler,

24:12.920 --> 24:16.680
 whatever you think about Alex Jones,

24:16.680 --> 24:18.920
 whatever you thought about Milianopolis,

24:18.920 --> 24:21.400
 the state has an interest in,

24:21.400 --> 24:25.360
 and has always had an interest in crushing dissent.

24:25.360 --> 24:26.920
 This is what the state has done.

24:26.920 --> 24:31.760
 This is how they, you know, retain the power they have

24:31.760 --> 24:34.400
 by eliminating dissent where they can.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.280
 Now, because you don't have, you know,

24:36.280 --> 24:37.920
 three broadcast networks anymore,

24:37.920 --> 24:41.120
 and a handful of newspapers that were all run, by the way,

24:41.120 --> 24:45.880
 by people that had been either compromised or happily,

24:45.880 --> 24:48.520
 you know, happily going with the program,

24:48.520 --> 24:51.560
 and you have this wild west of the internet,

24:51.560 --> 24:54.320
 people like me, people that make,

24:54.320 --> 24:57.200
 I make funny content that I hope is funny,

24:57.200 --> 24:59.440
 but a lot of it is wild and crazy.

24:59.440 --> 25:01.720
 I say a lot of wild and crazy things.

25:01.720 --> 25:02.800
 They're very funny.

25:02.800 --> 25:05.920
 I say a lot of wild and crazy things about powerful people.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.200
 You mock the powerful in there

25:07.200 --> 25:09.160
 by bringing them down a notch.

25:09.160 --> 25:10.280
 We'll probably talk about it,

25:10.280 --> 25:15.280
 but humor is one of the tools to balance the powers

25:16.200 --> 25:17.200
 in society.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.040
 Well, sure.

25:18.040 --> 25:19.800
 And to make people feel better about things

25:19.800 --> 25:22.440
 and to, you know, whatever the case may be, right?

25:22.440 --> 25:23.840
 That's my goal is to kind of like,

25:23.840 --> 25:25.560
 hey, people have had a shitty day.

25:25.560 --> 25:29.280
 If this video or podcast makes you laugh, that's great.

25:29.280 --> 25:31.280
 I think that it won't ever,

25:31.280 --> 25:32.960
 it was never gonna stop at Alex Jones.

25:32.960 --> 25:35.480
 Not that I think he should have been taking off everything

25:35.480 --> 25:36.560
 the way he was,

25:36.560 --> 25:41.400
 but this keeps going until we have sanitized

25:41.400 --> 25:42.560
 all of social media.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.880
 And what they really want it to be

25:44.880 --> 25:46.600
 is what Instagram is kind of becoming,

25:46.600 --> 25:48.440
 which is a marketplace of,

25:48.440 --> 25:51.080
 you could just go and buy sneakers, go buy a sweatshirt,

25:51.080 --> 25:53.640
 go buy jeans, go buy this, go buy that.

25:53.640 --> 25:56.000
 And the idea of the free exchange of information

25:56.000 --> 25:58.280
 seems to be the old internet.

25:58.280 --> 26:01.800
 And it seems the new internet seems to be, you know,

26:01.800 --> 26:03.400
 hyper, and I'm a capitalist,

26:03.400 --> 26:05.000
 but this seems to be like hyper capitalist

26:05.000 --> 26:08.720
 in the sense of like, they only want you consuming things

26:08.720 --> 26:12.000
 and they don't want you thinking too much.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.480
 And that seems to be where it's heading.

26:13.480 --> 26:14.840
 I've even seen that with Instagram

26:14.840 --> 26:16.600
 where it's like everything on Instagram is like,

26:16.600 --> 26:19.000
 buy a sweatshirt, you know?

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
 And I'm like, all right, man.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.080
 Hey man, if I want a sweatshirt, I'll get it.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.040
 Like, relax.

26:25.040 --> 26:29.800
 You know, just every ad seems to be encouraging consumption,

26:29.800 --> 26:33.760
 but very few things seem geared towards,

26:33.760 --> 26:37.440
 hey, let's have a dialogue or let's,

26:37.440 --> 26:38.920
 and not that Instagram was ever great for that,

26:38.920 --> 26:40.520
 but like, if everything's are geared now

26:40.520 --> 26:42.360
 towards content on Instagram,

26:42.360 --> 26:44.800
 a lot of it seems geared towards shopping.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.960
 See, I don't know, that's an interesting point.

26:46.960 --> 26:50.800
 I don't know if the consumerism that capitalism leads to

26:50.800 --> 26:53.760
 is necessarily gets in the way of nuanced conversation.

26:53.760 --> 26:57.160
 I feel like you could still sell Tim Dillon sweatshirts

26:57.160 --> 26:59.640
 and have a difficult nuanced conversation

26:59.640 --> 27:03.480
 or mock the current president, the previous president,

27:03.480 --> 27:05.400
 mock the powerful, all that kind of stuff.

27:05.400 --> 27:06.240
 Yeah, we try.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.080
 We try to balance that.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.080
 Do you have sweatshirts?

27:08.080 --> 27:09.720
 We do.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.440
 Are they on sale now, fake business?

27:12.440 --> 27:14.080
 We do, fake business sweatshirt

27:14.080 --> 27:15.400
 with the Enron logo, fake business,

27:15.400 --> 27:17.240
 because I do fake business all the time.

27:17.240 --> 27:18.800
 It would be nice if you talk about Alex Jones

27:18.800 --> 27:21.280
 if you plug the sweatshirt during that conversation.

27:21.280 --> 27:23.240
 Yeah, we'll do that, absolutely.

27:23.240 --> 27:25.200
 But what I tend to worry about with,

27:26.120 --> 27:29.600
 I see social media and technology

27:29.600 --> 27:32.280
 existing to flatten society.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.440
 It makes people very boring.

27:34.440 --> 27:38.680
 All of the experiences kids have right now are online.

27:38.680 --> 27:40.600
 Many of their closest friendships are online.

27:40.600 --> 27:42.920
 Their first relationships are online.

27:42.920 --> 27:45.640
 The culture is very homogenous,

27:45.640 --> 27:47.960
 and I think it's eliminating characters.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.680
 It's eliminating interesting people.

27:49.680 --> 27:52.200
 It's making people into AI.

27:52.200 --> 27:53.040
 All of their tastes.

27:53.040 --> 27:53.880
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:53.880 --> 27:54.720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.920
 AI could be Charles Bukowski as well.

27:56.920 --> 27:57.880
 Let's not get crazy.

27:57.880 --> 27:59.600
 It's not there yet, right?

27:59.600 --> 28:03.720
 I mean, the $75,000 dog is not doing anything.

28:03.720 --> 28:06.360
 So we're not there yet.

28:06.360 --> 28:07.200
 Listen, I hate people.

28:07.200 --> 28:08.280
 I get why you like AI so much.

28:08.280 --> 28:11.240
 I hate people too, and I'm very amenable to AI,

28:11.240 --> 28:12.920
 and I agree with you.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.080
 Listen, I think the future,

28:14.080 --> 28:15.720
 we gotta get everyone out of here.

28:15.720 --> 28:17.480
 I'm with you on that, so don't think I'm.

28:17.480 --> 28:18.360
 I love people.

28:18.360 --> 28:20.720
 He's manipulating my mind and my.

28:20.720 --> 28:22.800
 That's why the flash of light in your eyes

28:22.800 --> 28:24.360
 when you talked about that dog

28:24.360 --> 28:27.120
 was so much more than any person.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.000
 And I get it, by the way.

28:28.000 --> 28:28.840
 You're right.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.000
 I hate people, but if we could.

28:30.000 --> 28:30.840
 They're not excited.

28:30.840 --> 28:33.840
 If we could just use robots to kill most of them,

28:33.840 --> 28:35.880
 I think that would be good for society.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.120
 I'm with that too,

28:37.120 --> 28:40.520
 but I think that social media flattens people.

28:40.520 --> 28:42.320
 Flattening the personalities of characters.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.600
 Flatten the personalities of people, man.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.040
 And it's just, you know, when's the last time?

28:45.040 --> 28:47.640
 Like, I like the idea of like, you know,

28:47.640 --> 28:51.240
 and I'm, you know, somebody showing up to high school

28:51.240 --> 28:53.000
 with like a backpack and taking out an old CD

28:53.000 --> 28:54.560
 and being like, hey man, here's this band

28:54.560 --> 28:56.840
 you've never heard of that I love

28:56.840 --> 28:58.280
 or whatever, you gotta get into this.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.120
 And I'm like, you know, when I talk to young,

29:00.120 --> 29:01.360
 you know, I have friends that have younger brothers

29:01.360 --> 29:02.480
 and everything.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.760
 And I know that the dominant culture was always dominant.

29:04.760 --> 29:05.880
 I'm not an idiot, but like,

29:05.880 --> 29:08.480
 I feel like it's harder to be unique and original now

29:08.480 --> 29:12.000
 because so much of what's promoted

29:12.000 --> 29:15.360
 is just this way to kind of corral people

29:15.360 --> 29:18.700
 into believing and thinking a certain set of ideals

29:18.700 --> 29:20.800
 that's constantly shifting and evolving.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.400
 And people are just caught up in that.

29:23.400 --> 29:27.280
 And to me, it gets very boring very quickly.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.720
 I hate being bored and that's what it is.

29:29.720 --> 29:30.640
 I don't know what to do with that

29:30.640 --> 29:33.120
 because at the same time, podcasts are really popular,

29:33.120 --> 29:34.640
 long form podcasts are really popular

29:34.640 --> 29:38.320
 and people are hungry for those kinds of conversations.

29:38.320 --> 29:41.000
 There's a lot of dangerous ideas, quote unquote,

29:41.000 --> 29:44.920
 flowing, being spread around through podcasts,

29:44.920 --> 29:46.640
 meaning just like debates.

29:46.640 --> 29:47.480
 Correct.

29:47.480 --> 29:49.080
 You know, so that's still popular.

29:49.080 --> 29:50.580
 So I don't know what to.

29:50.580 --> 29:51.420
 I agree with you.

29:51.420 --> 29:52.440
 That gives me hope, I guess.

29:52.440 --> 29:53.280
 I hope so too.

29:53.280 --> 29:55.360
 And like I said, I look at the negative a lot

29:55.360 --> 29:57.200
 because that's what I usually make fun of,

29:57.200 --> 30:00.000
 but there's a lot of positive stuff happening too.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.060
 Let's talk a bit about Alex Jones.

30:04.640 --> 30:06.780
 So you've gotten a chance to talk to him

30:06.780 --> 30:09.080
 while you were on the Joe Rogan Experience.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.520
 I've been on Alex's show.

30:10.520 --> 30:12.920
 I've talked, I've had Alex on my show.

30:12.920 --> 30:15.320
 I've talked to Alex for three hours

30:15.320 --> 30:18.080
 in front of, I guess it was maybe like 15 million people

30:18.080 --> 30:19.040
 right on Joe's show.

30:19.040 --> 30:20.660
 It was a really wild conversation.

30:20.660 --> 30:24.320
 I think it was one of the coolest moments in broadcasting

30:24.320 --> 30:26.760
 that clearly that I've ever been a part of.

30:26.760 --> 30:29.180
 But I think it goes in the lexicon of like,

30:29.180 --> 30:31.240
 these are big podcasts.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.140
 Like I think it's one of the biggest podcasts.

30:33.140 --> 30:35.300
 A week before the election, Alex Jones.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.280
 I'm really grateful that Joe gave me the opportunity

30:37.280 --> 30:38.440
 to be there.

30:38.440 --> 30:41.400
 And it was just an amazing conversation to watch.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.600
 What was the shirt you wore?

30:43.600 --> 30:44.440
 Fridges Lane.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.520
 It was a fun joke that no one in tech got

30:46.520 --> 30:48.760
 because we all know how funny they are.

30:48.760 --> 30:50.800
 But the tech writers, which is mainly blue haired.

30:50.800 --> 30:51.640
 I do not agree with these statements.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.200
 It's mainly blue haired people

30:53.200 --> 30:55.600
 whose goal in life is to find things

30:55.600 --> 30:57.440
 to give them orgasms with.

30:57.440 --> 31:00.200
 If you want to dye your hair blue, it's your choice.

31:00.200 --> 31:01.040
 I respect it.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.520
 Yeah, but is it your choice?

31:02.520 --> 31:04.480
 But at the end of the day, it's like,

31:04.480 --> 31:06.520
 all the tech writers, like a lot of people just,

31:06.520 --> 31:08.920
 and I'm not, I'm just maligning tech unfairly.

31:08.920 --> 31:10.400
 But a lot of people that sense there's a humor

31:10.400 --> 31:12.800
 were like, he's advocating for human trafficking.

31:12.800 --> 31:13.960
 I'm like, it's clearly a joke

31:13.960 --> 31:16.600
 because we're coming off the believe all women.

31:16.600 --> 31:17.760
 We're coming off that.

31:17.760 --> 31:20.240
 And it's very funny to just say Fridges Lane,

31:20.240 --> 31:21.360
 hey man, believe all women.

31:21.360 --> 31:24.840
 Like, it's just our politics and our public sphere

31:24.840 --> 31:26.880
 is so schizophrenic right now

31:26.880 --> 31:28.360
 that when you point that out,

31:28.360 --> 31:29.880
 people are going to be angry with you.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.680
 But that was a fun shirt to wear.

31:31.680 --> 31:34.400
 But on Alex, you know, I was one of the people

31:34.400 --> 31:37.280
 that found him really entertaining,

31:37.280 --> 31:40.560
 that the same kind of thing as with Bukowski,

31:40.560 --> 31:44.280
 these kinds of personalities that are wild,

31:44.280 --> 31:46.760
 crazy, full of ideas.

31:46.760 --> 31:48.480
 They don't have to be grounded in truth at all,

31:48.480 --> 31:50.800
 or they can be grounded in truth a little bit.

31:50.800 --> 31:53.040
 Like, he's just playing with ideas,

31:53.040 --> 31:55.880
 like a jazz musician, screaming sometimes.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.760
 Obviously he has some demons.

31:57.760 --> 32:01.200
 Sometimes he's super angry for no reason whatsoever

32:01.200 --> 32:04.440
 at some weird thing that he's constructing in his own head.

32:04.440 --> 32:06.520
 Sometimes he's super loving and peaceful,

32:06.520 --> 32:08.360
 especially lately that I've heard him,

32:08.360 --> 32:09.320
 I don't know if you've seen with him,

32:09.320 --> 32:11.560
 with Michael Malice, where he's doing,

32:11.560 --> 32:14.320
 like Malice was doing,

32:14.320 --> 32:17.240
 like telling Alex Jones, I love you, Alex.

32:17.240 --> 32:20.160
 Just this loving kind of softness and kindness

32:20.160 --> 32:21.120
 underneath it all.

32:21.120 --> 32:22.600
 I don't know what to make of any of it.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.520
 And then there's this huge number of people

32:24.520 --> 32:28.560
 that tell me that Alex Jones is dangerous for society.

32:29.440 --> 32:30.640
 So what do you do with that?

32:30.640 --> 32:32.360
 Do you think he's dangerous for society?

32:32.360 --> 32:35.000
 Do you think he is one of the sort of

32:35.000 --> 32:37.480
 entertaining personalities of our time

32:37.480 --> 32:39.800
 that shouldn't be suppressed or somewhere in between?

32:39.800 --> 32:43.880
 I don't think that Alex per se is dangerous for society.

32:43.880 --> 32:46.520
 I think the greater danger for society comes again

32:46.520 --> 32:50.040
 from stifling all dissent, right?

32:50.040 --> 32:53.120
 All, like anybody with a voice that uses it,

32:53.120 --> 32:54.920
 that critiques the government,

32:54.920 --> 32:58.120
 and putting all of those people in a category

32:58.120 --> 33:00.280
 and getting rid of them is incredibly dangerous.

33:00.280 --> 33:01.840
 To me, more so.

33:01.840 --> 33:05.440
 I think the biggest problem that Alex has ever had

33:05.440 --> 33:08.160
 was when he questioned the Sandy Hook shooting.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.640
 And that really was,

33:09.640 --> 33:12.920
 because it really is this identifiable incident

33:12.920 --> 33:15.480
 that you can look at where it did get away from him

33:15.480 --> 33:16.880
 and a lot of his fans who,

33:16.880 --> 33:18.760
 the people that are attracted to conspiracy stuff,

33:18.760 --> 33:20.040
 and I have some of those fans,

33:20.040 --> 33:21.840
 some of them are really smart people,

33:21.840 --> 33:23.480
 some of them are mentally unwell.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.680
 A lot of them happen to be mentally unwell.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.160
 So when you have a fan base of people

33:27.160 --> 33:28.920
 where some of them are mentally unwell,

33:28.920 --> 33:33.920
 and you are questioning tragic events, okay?

33:33.920 --> 33:35.520
 And Alex was right about Epstein.

33:35.520 --> 33:36.680
 He was right about a lot of things,

33:36.680 --> 33:38.360
 and he's got no credit for that.

33:38.360 --> 33:40.840
 And I understand that this,

33:40.840 --> 33:42.480
 sometimes when you write about 10 things

33:42.480 --> 33:43.800
 and you're wrong about something,

33:43.800 --> 33:48.560
 and the thing you're wrong about is so offensive to people,

33:48.560 --> 33:50.600
 you're never gonna get any credit for being right,

33:50.600 --> 33:52.880
 even though you were right more than when you were wrong.

33:52.880 --> 33:56.760
 The problem was a lot of his fans who were crazy stalked,

33:56.760 --> 34:00.040
 harassed these families and accused them of being actors

34:00.040 --> 34:02.680
 and accused them of faking their children's deaths.

34:02.680 --> 34:06.040
 It was just horrific experience.

34:06.040 --> 34:08.080
 And Alex is tied to that.

34:08.080 --> 34:13.080
 And how much he inspired that by what he did on his show,

34:14.360 --> 34:18.160
 I don't know because I haven't watched hours and hours

34:18.160 --> 34:21.640
 of that particular thing, the whole Sandy Hook thing.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.720
 If you listen to him, he says, I really covered it.

34:24.720 --> 34:26.440
 I kind of covered it and moved on.

34:26.440 --> 34:29.000
 Other people go, no, he spent a long time on it.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.080
 But that's the real danger of going into that territory

34:32.080 --> 34:33.320
 over and over again,

34:33.320 --> 34:37.000
 going everything's a false flag or everything's fake.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.440
 I think Alex has actually been kind of reasonable.

34:39.440 --> 34:43.440
 He's resisted a lot of the politics of racial resentment

34:43.440 --> 34:46.040
 on the alt right, for example, he's resisted that.

34:46.040 --> 34:49.400
 He's resisted the antisemitic currents

34:49.400 --> 34:51.200
 of a lot of that politics.

34:51.200 --> 34:55.560
 He's resisted a lot of the virulently anti trans

34:55.560 --> 34:56.400
 or anti gay stuff.

34:56.400 --> 34:57.960
 Now he does dip his toe into the water

34:57.960 --> 35:00.680
 of like the culture wars, of course he does.

35:00.680 --> 35:03.640
 But I've never really seen him,

35:03.640 --> 35:05.080
 and I could be wrong about this,

35:05.080 --> 35:08.520
 embrace white nationalism or identitarianism.

35:08.520 --> 35:10.520
 I've never seen him really go antisemitic.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.880
 I've never seen him take that route.

35:12.880 --> 35:15.320
 When I grew up and I would turn him on every now and then,

35:15.320 --> 35:17.200
 he was talking about NAFTA, the WTO,

35:17.200 --> 35:18.480
 he's talking about 9 11,

35:18.480 --> 35:22.760
 he was talking about the world trade organizations

35:22.760 --> 35:24.040
 and a lot of these big conferences,

35:24.040 --> 35:25.840
 whether it was the Bilderberg group,

35:25.840 --> 35:28.800
 whether it was a Bohemian Grove, which he infiltrated.

35:28.800 --> 35:29.680
 And he was talking about,

35:29.680 --> 35:31.480
 hey, here are the most powerful people in the world.

35:31.480 --> 35:32.760
 Here's what they're doing.

35:32.760 --> 35:34.200
 And here's how it affects you.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.560
 And that was interesting to me

35:35.560 --> 35:37.720
 because no one else was really talking about it

35:37.720 --> 35:42.040
 except Alex Jones, occasionally Art Bell on WABC.

35:42.040 --> 35:45.360
 You'd listen to him at night, right?

35:45.360 --> 35:48.200
 I think Alex became very controversial

35:48.200 --> 35:50.040
 when he decided to back Donald Trump.

35:50.040 --> 35:51.960
 And then he has a considerable following

35:51.960 --> 35:53.640
 and a considerable audience

35:53.640 --> 35:56.760
 that he was then able to marshal

35:56.760 --> 35:59.920
 in the direction of supporting Donald Trump.

35:59.920 --> 36:02.000
 That was when the spotlight,

36:02.000 --> 36:05.520
 because then he was talking to Trump, Trump did his show,

36:05.520 --> 36:07.360
 Alex Jones just got bigger, right?

36:07.360 --> 36:09.000
 And he blew up, that's the term, right?

36:09.000 --> 36:13.800
 He blew off, he put out the Good HBO special,

36:13.800 --> 36:14.680
 whatever you wanna call it.

36:14.680 --> 36:16.840
 He has a hit song, he blew up.

36:16.840 --> 36:18.560
 And then people started looking at the things

36:18.560 --> 36:20.280
 that he was associated with.

36:20.280 --> 36:22.160
 The Sandy Hook thing is a blemish on his record.

36:22.160 --> 36:23.680
 I do believe he regrets it.

36:23.680 --> 36:25.600
 But again, I do see the point of the families

36:25.600 --> 36:27.480
 who are like, dude, fuck this guy forever.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.360
 This is the worst thing I ever went through.

36:29.360 --> 36:34.360
 It's a very tough, I understand the people that say that.

36:35.680 --> 36:38.720
 I understand, and I understand the people that go,

36:38.720 --> 36:41.280
 when you have tech companies that act

36:41.280 --> 36:43.640
 in a coordinated manner to just get rid of someone,

36:43.640 --> 36:46.600
 they don't have any way to defend themselves.

36:46.600 --> 36:49.120
 It's a little terrifying when you think

36:49.120 --> 36:53.520
 about that power being abused and how wouldn't it be?

36:53.520 --> 36:56.040
 Do you think he should have not have been banned

36:56.040 --> 36:57.120
 from all these platforms?

36:57.120 --> 36:59.520
 I don't think, I do think that

36:59.520 --> 37:01.680
 if you are a private company, right?

37:01.680 --> 37:04.680
 I do think, and this is where you run into this problem.

37:04.680 --> 37:06.680
 I don't know if these tech companies

37:06.680 --> 37:09.480
 were government utilities, would that decrease

37:09.480 --> 37:11.000
 people's likelihood of being banned?

37:11.000 --> 37:12.880
 I don't know, right?

37:12.880 --> 37:17.880
 So I understand the benefit of them being treated

37:18.040 --> 37:19.800
 like public utilities and people thinking

37:19.800 --> 37:21.600
 they have the right to a Twitter.

37:21.600 --> 37:25.440
 I've never, I don't know, I have very little confidence.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.120
 I mean, the government's trying to roll out a vaccine

37:27.120 --> 37:29.580
 in California and we vaccinated like five people.

37:29.580 --> 37:32.720
 I mean, in terms of what we need to do in the state, right?

37:32.720 --> 37:34.800
 So maybe if it was a government utility,

37:34.800 --> 37:37.600
 I do think someone like Alex,

37:37.600 --> 37:40.720
 like there should be some process.

37:40.720 --> 37:42.040
 So if you're gonna get rid of someone,

37:42.040 --> 37:44.280
 they should have a way to defend themselves.

37:44.280 --> 37:49.280
 There should be more democratic process

37:50.120 --> 37:51.860
 that you can go through

37:51.860 --> 37:54.580
 than just being unilaterally taken off something.

37:54.580 --> 37:57.160
 But like, then you run into the,

37:57.160 --> 37:58.800
 you're like, am I gonna say that everyone deserves?

37:58.800 --> 38:00.920
 No, if you're threatening or harassing people

38:00.920 --> 38:02.000
 or threatening to kill them,

38:02.000 --> 38:03.240
 publishing their private information,

38:03.240 --> 38:05.840
 if you're committing crimes on these platforms,

38:05.840 --> 38:07.800
 obviously the people that own these platforms

38:07.800 --> 38:10.400
 are gonna be like, we're not gonna allow this to happen.

38:10.400 --> 38:14.280
 So I understand that there is a line, right?

38:14.280 --> 38:16.600
 There is some, like people that say there's no line

38:16.600 --> 38:19.000
 aren't really thinking, like there is a line.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.680
 I just thought that line seems to be moving all the time

38:22.680 --> 38:24.960
 and it seems to be a very hard thing to police.

38:24.960 --> 38:28.200
 But I don't think you can remove a guy off everything

38:28.200 --> 38:31.000
 and then also bank accounts won't give him debit cards

38:31.000 --> 38:32.360
 or credit cards, I don't know if you talked to him

38:32.360 --> 38:34.080
 about that, but like, you know,

38:34.080 --> 38:36.040
 there were financial institutions that were refusing

38:36.040 --> 38:38.000
 to let him park his money there.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.160
 So, I mean, it really does get pretty terrifying

38:42.160 --> 38:43.180
 pretty quickly.

38:44.040 --> 38:46.640
 Probably without any transparency from those companies.

38:46.640 --> 38:50.440
 So you're right, it feels like there should be a process

38:50.440 --> 38:54.160
 of just having, for him to defend himself.

38:54.160 --> 38:55.760
 I think there needs to be a process

38:55.760 --> 38:57.380
 for people to defend themselves.

38:59.160 --> 39:00.880
 Every day I wake up and I go,

39:00.880 --> 39:03.040
 is something I said in a video gonna get taken

39:03.040 --> 39:05.000
 out of context, is somebody gonna get angry,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.840
 is somebody gonna be, you know, I say wild stuff

39:07.840 --> 39:09.240
 because that's what makes me laugh,

39:09.240 --> 39:10.300
 that's what makes my friends laugh

39:10.300 --> 39:12.200
 and that's what makes my audience laugh.

39:12.200 --> 39:17.200
 So I never ever, people, you know, whatever political side

39:17.200 --> 39:20.660
 you come down on, I think if you make your living speaking,

39:20.660 --> 39:24.620
 it's always interesting to me if you are pro

39:24.620 --> 39:27.320
 the deplatforming, that's odd.

39:27.320 --> 39:31.080
 It's interesting to consider a kind of a jury context

39:32.800 --> 39:35.120
 to where, you know, there's transparency

39:35.120 --> 39:38.560
 about why your video about bombing Disney World

39:38.560 --> 39:43.040
 might be taken down, like it gets taken down

39:43.040 --> 39:45.920
 and then there is, it's almost like creating

39:45.920 --> 39:47.800
 a little court case, a mini court case

39:47.800 --> 39:51.400
 and not in a legal sense, but in the public sphere.

39:51.400 --> 39:53.920
 And then people should be able to have, you know,

39:53.920 --> 39:57.560
 we pick representatives of our current society

39:57.560 --> 40:00.760
 and have a discussion about that and make a real vote.

40:00.760 --> 40:03.560
 You know, just have like jury locks himself up

40:03.560 --> 40:08.100
 in a discussion, that kind of process might be necessary.

40:08.100 --> 40:11.720
 Right now, what happens is Twitter is completely,

40:11.720 --> 40:13.560
 first of all, they're just mostly not aware

40:13.560 --> 40:15.680
 of everything they're doing, there's too much stuff,

40:15.680 --> 40:18.000
 but the stuff they're aware about,

40:18.000 --> 40:21.600
 they make the decision in closed doors meetings

40:21.600 --> 40:25.400
 and without any transparency to the rest of the company

40:25.400 --> 40:29.480
 actually, but also transparency to the rest of the world.

40:29.480 --> 40:33.900
 And so, and then all they say is we're making decisions

40:33.900 --> 40:37.760
 because the people, they use things like violence.

40:37.760 --> 40:41.640
 So violence equals bad and if this person is quote unquote,

40:41.640 --> 40:44.800
 inciting violence, therefore that gives us enough reason

40:44.800 --> 40:48.000
 to ban them without any kind of process.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.840
 I mean, it's interesting, I'm torn in the whole thing.

40:51.840 --> 40:54.540
 If it was indeed, there's no transparency about it,

40:54.540 --> 40:59.000
 but if Parler was indeed inciting violence,

40:59.000 --> 41:02.240
 like if there was brewing of violence, potential violence

41:02.240 --> 41:06.820
 where, you know, thousands of people might die

41:06.820 --> 41:10.800
 because of some kind of riot, like this is the scary thing

41:10.800 --> 41:15.320
 about mob, about when a lot of people get together.

41:15.320 --> 41:19.080
 Who are good people, like legitimately good people

41:19.080 --> 41:21.960
 that love this country, that don't see enemies

41:21.960 --> 41:26.080
 yet around them, but if they get excited together

41:26.080 --> 41:30.240
 and there's guns involved and then some cop gets nervous

41:30.240 --> 41:33.440
 and shoots one person, another person shoots the cop

41:33.440 --> 41:35.240
 and then there's a lot of shooting involved

41:35.240 --> 41:38.160
 and then it goes from five people dying in the Capitol

41:38.160 --> 41:41.040
 to thousands of people dying in the Capitol.

41:41.040 --> 41:44.520
 Well, in fairness to defend the people at the Capitol,

41:44.520 --> 41:47.700
 they didn't shoot the cop, they bludgeoned him to death

41:47.700 --> 41:49.560
 with a fire extinguisher.

41:49.560 --> 41:50.400
 Yes.

41:50.400 --> 41:52.960
 So I do wanna just kind of put that out

41:52.960 --> 41:54.720
 as a defense of them.

41:54.720 --> 41:57.400
 Listen, I'm sure there was some wild shit going on

41:57.400 --> 41:59.760
 on Parler and I think the problem, here's the problem,

41:59.760 --> 42:03.520
 right, there's a lot of people that just wanna go on

42:03.520 --> 42:06.400
 these sites and say they wanna kill everyone.

42:06.400 --> 42:09.960
 And the problem is, you know, at what point

42:09.960 --> 42:11.680
 do you shut them all down?

42:11.680 --> 42:14.440
 Like I think a lot of people are just living in a world

42:14.440 --> 42:17.280
 where they're powerless, they don't have any political

42:17.280 --> 42:19.680
 power, they don't have any economic power, right?

42:19.680 --> 42:22.040
 They can't throw their money around.

42:22.040 --> 42:26.100
 They don't have healthcare, their job security isn't great.

42:26.100 --> 42:28.580
 They might be living in a community that doesn't have

42:28.580 --> 42:31.440
 the resources they would like it to have.

42:31.440 --> 42:34.040
 They're not happy and thrilled.

42:34.040 --> 42:36.060
 And then they have these sites where they can go on

42:36.060 --> 42:39.740
 and just say, man, I'd like to fucking burn it all down.

42:39.740 --> 42:42.720
 And distinguishing a guy blowing off steam

42:42.720 --> 42:45.960
 and saying wild stuff from a genuine threat

42:45.960 --> 42:49.000
 is a very hard thing to do, you know?

42:49.000 --> 42:52.860
 Like I've threatened to kill, I got banned from Airbnb,

42:52.860 --> 42:57.520
 I threatened to kill the people that banned me,

42:57.520 --> 43:00.520
 comedically, comedically, this is a joke.

43:00.520 --> 43:02.760
 I'm not going to kill you, this is a joke

43:02.760 --> 43:05.140
 because I'm blowing off steam and I'm angry.

43:05.140 --> 43:07.280
 Do you know how many people that my parents,

43:07.280 --> 43:09.480
 like my dad's like, I'm gonna fucking kill this guy,

43:09.480 --> 43:11.560
 my mom's like, I'm gonna fucking kill.

43:11.560 --> 43:13.160
 They were talking about each other.

43:13.160 --> 43:17.360
 But none of it ever happened, but we should be,

43:17.360 --> 43:21.220
 I think you have to create a space for people

43:21.220 --> 43:24.160
 to threaten to overthrow the government

43:24.160 --> 43:26.880
 as long as they don't violently do it.

43:26.880 --> 43:28.720
 I mean, does that make any sense?

43:28.720 --> 43:32.280
 I mean, as long as they're not gonna go hurt innocent people,

43:32.280 --> 43:33.120
 what are you gonna do?

43:33.120 --> 43:34.920
 Like there's so many people out there that,

43:34.920 --> 43:38.020
 that's why a lot of these things like 4chan, these sites,

43:38.020 --> 43:39.160
 a lot of people going on there,

43:39.160 --> 43:41.600
 they just wanna say the most fucked up shit

43:41.600 --> 43:44.480
 because it's the thing that gives them,

43:44.480 --> 43:46.480
 they can laugh or they can release steam

43:46.480 --> 43:48.980
 and it is immature, it is stupid.

43:48.980 --> 43:51.280
 It's not productive, it's not, you know,

43:51.280 --> 43:52.980
 but at the end of the day,

43:53.880 --> 43:56.280
 if you're not gonna give people health insurance,

43:56.280 --> 43:57.960
 you gotta give them something.

43:57.960 --> 44:00.020
 It's like when someone in this country dies

44:00.020 --> 44:01.880
 that everyone disagrees with, right?

44:01.880 --> 44:03.720
 Political figure, media figure,

44:03.720 --> 44:06.160
 a lot of people dance on their grave online

44:06.160 --> 44:07.920
 and then everyone, people goes,

44:07.920 --> 44:09.760
 and the other side will always do it.

44:09.760 --> 44:12.280
 Like if a conservative dies and everyone goes, great,

44:12.280 --> 44:15.480
 conservatives goes, this is grotesque that you,

44:15.480 --> 44:17.880
 and then when RBG dies, they all have parties

44:17.880 --> 44:19.480
 and the conservatives go, great.

44:20.680 --> 44:22.960
 You have to let people in this country

44:22.960 --> 44:25.060
 enjoy the deaths of their enemies.

44:26.280 --> 44:29.560
 You do because they don't have much else.

44:29.560 --> 44:31.680
 Again, if you gave them other things,

44:31.680 --> 44:34.780
 you might say, guy, you can go get an E operation.

44:34.780 --> 44:36.960
 Why don't you stop?

44:36.960 --> 44:40.440
 But if they're working for shit wages

44:40.440 --> 44:43.560
 and you haven't figured out a way to treat them,

44:44.440 --> 44:48.160
 treat their cancer diagnosis, and they don't like,

44:48.160 --> 44:51.240
 I mean, life, you know, you gotta,

44:51.240 --> 44:54.240
 you gotta derive pleasure from something, right?

44:54.240 --> 44:57.720
 It's an interesting point that anger is a good valve,

44:57.720 --> 45:01.760
 like to, if your life is suffering,

45:01.760 --> 45:04.920
 that there's something very powerful about anger,

45:04.920 --> 45:07.680
 but I still have hope that it doesn't have to be.

45:07.680 --> 45:10.040
 I mean, that kind of channeling into anger

45:10.960 --> 45:13.480
 that then becomes hate led us

45:13.480 --> 45:15.800
 into a lot of troubles in human history.

45:15.800 --> 45:20.720
 So you have to be careful empowering people too much

45:20.720 --> 45:23.840
 in that anger, especially, I think my,

45:24.840 --> 45:28.960
 I think I understand why people are nervous about Parler,

45:28.960 --> 45:30.680
 about Twitter and so on.

45:30.680 --> 45:35.160
 Because all that shit talking about violence

45:35.160 --> 45:39.080
 was now paired with let's get together at this location.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.400
 This was a new thing.

45:41.400 --> 45:46.200
 Like it's not just being on whatever platform talking shit,

45:46.200 --> 45:49.840
 it's saying we're going to in physical space meet.

45:49.840 --> 45:52.520
 And then everybody got, all these platforms got nervous.

45:52.520 --> 45:55.060
 Well, what happens when all these shit talkers,

45:55.060 --> 45:57.960
 all these angry people that are just steam,

45:57.960 --> 46:01.080
 letting off steam meet in a physical space.

46:01.080 --> 46:03.960
 And there was probably overreach,

46:03.960 --> 46:05.240
 almost definitely overreach,

46:05.240 --> 46:07.240
 but I can understand why they were nervous.

46:07.240 --> 46:08.080
 I agree.

46:08.080 --> 46:08.900
 There doesn't seem to be,

46:08.900 --> 46:10.160
 and this is when Trump got elected

46:10.160 --> 46:11.960
 and when you have like, whatever you have, right?

46:11.960 --> 46:13.600
 Whether you have riots in Portland and Seattle,

46:13.600 --> 46:15.760
 where you have the Antifa people doing crazy things,

46:15.760 --> 46:18.660
 you have like the people storming the Capitol.

46:18.660 --> 46:22.000
 There never seems to be a ton of an examination

46:22.000 --> 46:24.560
 of why these ideas are becoming popular.

46:24.560 --> 46:26.240
 Why are people so angry?

46:26.240 --> 46:28.280
 What is leading people to this?

46:28.280 --> 46:29.760
 Why are we here?

46:29.760 --> 46:32.280
 What about their lives is to the point

46:32.280 --> 46:34.880
 where they need to show up at these places?

46:34.880 --> 46:36.600
 And like, and obviously there's going to be people

46:36.600 --> 46:37.440
 on the fringe.

46:37.440 --> 46:38.900
 There'll always be the mentally unwell.

46:38.900 --> 46:41.460
 There'll always be people that want to destroy society.

46:41.460 --> 46:43.640
 But when you look at how popular,

46:43.640 --> 46:46.360
 large, long discredited things,

46:46.360 --> 46:50.080
 whether it's fascism, totalitarian communism,

46:50.080 --> 46:53.320
 all of these things are like, why are they back?

46:53.320 --> 46:54.800
 Why are they back in a big way?

46:54.800 --> 46:58.660
 And why are people so fed up with the status quo

46:58.660 --> 47:02.640
 that they're finding solace

47:02.640 --> 47:07.560
 in the most extreme discredited theories

47:07.560 --> 47:10.000
 of how to run and operate societies,

47:10.000 --> 47:11.720
 theories that have led to deaths of a lot of people.

47:11.720 --> 47:16.580
 So to me, I'm like, if those people at the Capitol,

47:17.560 --> 47:20.240
 yes, if they were going to work,

47:20.240 --> 47:24.680
 if they were able to go out and drink at Chili's,

47:24.680 --> 47:29.320
 if they were able to get a fucking checkup, right?

47:29.320 --> 47:32.080
 Like if their job paid a little bit better,

47:32.080 --> 47:34.600
 and I'm not saying that this is all the reason, right?

47:34.600 --> 47:36.120
 I'm sure that there's a lot of people there

47:36.120 --> 47:38.680
 that are doing quite well and they're still nuts.

47:38.680 --> 47:40.760
 But like the anger and the rage

47:40.760 --> 47:44.200
 that's boiling to the surface of this society,

47:44.200 --> 47:49.200
 does it come from the fact that across the board

47:49.200 --> 47:51.680
 people in very different areas

47:51.680 --> 47:54.020
 and with very different political beliefs

47:54.020 --> 47:56.560
 feel like they are being fucked over

47:56.560 --> 47:59.540
 and there's nothing they can do about it.

47:59.540 --> 48:02.660
 That's what the baseline to me,

48:02.660 --> 48:05.080
 they look at the people that run the country

48:05.080 --> 48:07.840
 and run the world, whether they're tech titans,

48:07.840 --> 48:08.880
 the guys that you talked to,

48:08.880 --> 48:11.780
 or whether they're people that run the government,

48:11.780 --> 48:14.720
 whether they're people that run large banks,

48:14.720 --> 48:16.380
 large media companies,

48:16.380 --> 48:20.480
 the people that have created this kind of infrastructure

48:20.480 --> 48:21.720
 that everyone lives in,

48:21.720 --> 48:23.760
 these people are incredibly powerless.

48:23.760 --> 48:26.800
 And when you push people to that point,

48:26.800 --> 48:30.040
 logically, sadly, and unfortunately,

48:30.040 --> 48:33.600
 the next thing does seem to be violence.

48:33.600 --> 48:36.680
 Yeah, the thing that troubles me a lot

48:36.680 --> 48:41.680
 is you said nobody's asking why these beliefs are out there,

48:41.680 --> 48:44.340
 but sometimes it's not even acknowledged

48:44.340 --> 48:49.340
 that people are hurting, people are angry,

48:49.800 --> 48:52.900
 just even acknowledging that all the conspiracy theories

48:52.900 --> 48:55.520
 that are out there, acknowledging that they're out there.

48:55.520 --> 48:58.280
 And then people are thinking about it and talking about it

48:58.280 --> 49:00.920
 just because otherwise,

49:00.920 --> 49:03.260
 so it's not acknowledged in this nuanced way.

49:03.260 --> 49:04.660
 What happens is you say,

49:04.660 --> 49:07.660
 okay, 70 million people are white supremacists.

49:07.660 --> 49:12.160
 It's just throwing a kind of blanket statement.

49:12.160 --> 49:16.160
 And of course that gets them angrier

49:16.160 --> 49:19.640
 and makes them feel more powerless.

49:19.640 --> 49:24.640
 And that ultimately, that's what's been painful for me

49:25.000 --> 49:28.280
 to see is that there's not an acknowledgement

49:28.280 --> 49:31.960
 that most people are good.

49:31.960 --> 49:32.840
 Right.

49:32.840 --> 49:36.960
 There's circumstances where it's just you're pissed off.

49:36.960 --> 49:37.800
 Right.

49:37.800 --> 49:38.780
 Because you are powerless.

49:38.780 --> 49:39.960
 I mean, most of us are powerless.

49:39.960 --> 49:42.240
 You could fall in with a bad crowd.

49:42.240 --> 49:44.400
 That's the thing, you can just fall in.

49:44.400 --> 49:47.120
 And it doesn't mean that there's not blame.

49:47.120 --> 49:50.640
 Obviously you have agency, you're a person.

49:51.560 --> 49:54.000
 But the idea that you could be rehabilitated,

49:54.000 --> 49:55.400
 you could do something stupid

49:55.400 --> 49:58.440
 or you could fall into a group of people that are,

49:58.440 --> 49:59.800
 and then in a few years you can go,

49:59.800 --> 50:02.080
 what the fuck was I doing?

50:02.080 --> 50:03.040
 I'm an ex drug addict.

50:03.040 --> 50:05.200
 I know what it's like to go from being one thing

50:05.200 --> 50:06.880
 to being another thing.

50:06.880 --> 50:07.800
 I'm still a drug addict.

50:07.800 --> 50:09.600
 If I would use drugs right now or drink,

50:09.600 --> 50:11.200
 I would still be addicted to them.

50:11.200 --> 50:13.520
 I mean, it's not something that I can ever change

50:13.520 --> 50:14.880
 about myself, but I know what it's like

50:14.880 --> 50:16.340
 to go from one thing to another thing.

50:16.340 --> 50:19.960
 So when you look at racism or whatever ism,

50:19.960 --> 50:22.820
 homophobia, misogyny, whatever you're looking at,

50:22.820 --> 50:26.060
 antisemitism, and you go, that's a fixed condition

50:26.060 --> 50:28.480
 where nobody's ever going to be able to change.

50:28.480 --> 50:30.880
 Nobody's ever gonna be able to be rehabilitated.

50:30.880 --> 50:34.680
 Nobody's ever going to be able to reimagine themselves

50:34.680 --> 50:35.840
 in a different way.

50:35.840 --> 50:38.960
 To me, you're just, you're throwing away someone

50:38.960 --> 50:41.860
 and you're making them feel helpless and worthless.

50:41.860 --> 50:44.020
 And that's gonna lead to antisocial behavior

50:44.020 --> 50:45.960
 that spills out into the violence.

50:45.960 --> 50:48.760
 We don't have a very redemptive society.

50:48.760 --> 50:50.560
 That's a huge factor.

50:50.560 --> 50:52.640
 We don't have a redemptive society.

50:52.640 --> 50:54.600
 That's why I like O.J. Simpson.

50:54.600 --> 50:58.120
 Because O.J. Simpson, yes, he did a bad thing supposedly.

50:58.120 --> 51:01.280
 But he's very kind now on Twitter

51:01.280 --> 51:04.040
 and he makes very nice points about how we all have

51:04.040 --> 51:05.640
 to get involved in the political process

51:05.640 --> 51:07.920
 and he's on golf courses and I like watching people golf.

51:07.920 --> 51:10.080
 I don't do it, but I like watching him do it.

51:10.080 --> 51:12.040
 And he's like an elder statesman

51:12.040 --> 51:13.880
 because I remember him from the naked gun.

51:13.880 --> 51:18.880
 And I choose to forgive him for whatever happened there,

51:19.400 --> 51:20.980
 which I don't know.

51:20.980 --> 51:23.660
 But I choose to forgive him really for,

51:23.660 --> 51:25.800
 I mean, obviously, what they say is

51:25.800 --> 51:27.000
 he cut his wife's head off.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.880
 But I can look past that and redeem him

51:30.880 --> 51:35.160
 because he's very stable on Twitter and he's a good,

51:35.160 --> 51:37.580
 like I see all these people going crazy on Twitter

51:37.580 --> 51:41.600
 and I'm like, O.J.'s lived a full life.

51:41.600 --> 51:43.040
 I think there's a benefit to that.

51:43.040 --> 51:45.480
 There's a benefit to kind of living a full life.

51:45.480 --> 51:48.000
 Yeah, how many of us have not at least tried

51:48.000 --> 51:48.840
 to murder somebody?

51:48.840 --> 51:53.840
 100%, listen, O.J.'s had the highs and the lows,

51:53.840 --> 51:56.760
 but he did it on his terms.

51:56.760 --> 51:57.600
 And there's a real.

51:57.600 --> 51:59.560
 It's like a Frank Sinatra song.

51:59.560 --> 52:00.480
 Yeah, he did it my way.

52:00.480 --> 52:02.100
 I mean, there's a benefit to that.

52:02.100 --> 52:04.160
 And he seems like a very well adjusted person now.

52:04.160 --> 52:07.460
 So I mean, I don't know, how is that a fact?

52:07.460 --> 52:09.800
 But it is a fact and that's an uncomfortable fact.

52:09.800 --> 52:12.080
 Well, this is a strong case of forgiveness

52:12.080 --> 52:16.240
 in one of the more extreme cases, I suppose.

52:16.240 --> 52:18.820
 But yeah, there's not a process of forgiveness.

52:18.820 --> 52:21.400
 It seems like people just take a single event from your,

52:21.400 --> 52:23.920
 sometimes a single statement from your past

52:23.920 --> 52:28.920
 and use that as a categorical like capture

52:29.800 --> 52:31.880
 of the essence of this particular human being.

52:31.880 --> 52:36.800
 So murder might be a thing that you should get a time out

52:36.800 --> 52:38.280
 for a little while.

52:38.280 --> 52:39.660
 Murder is bad.

52:39.660 --> 52:42.640
 Murder, and let's just say that.

52:42.640 --> 52:44.160
 Murder is not good.

52:44.160 --> 52:46.560
 I'm glad you make this definitive statement.

52:46.560 --> 52:50.640
 O.J. is an interesting cat because you're like,

52:50.640 --> 52:53.300
 he's very stable on Twitter.

52:53.300 --> 52:55.880
 He's very like, he's like, let's take a look at it, guys.

52:55.880 --> 52:57.320
 Like we need more of his energy.

52:57.320 --> 52:58.640
 That's what I'm trying to say.

52:58.640 --> 53:00.600
 I know like, yes, it was bad.

53:00.600 --> 53:03.040
 He killed the woman in the waiter.

53:03.040 --> 53:04.600
 I was not for that.

53:04.600 --> 53:05.880
 I wish he didn't do that.

53:05.880 --> 53:10.040
 But the trial, the O.J. Simpson trial was such a fun thing.

53:10.040 --> 53:12.840
 And like you said, we need more fun people in society.

53:12.840 --> 53:14.040
 Speaking of fun people,

53:14.040 --> 53:17.680
 you've, your politics have been all over the place.

53:17.680 --> 53:18.840
 I hope so.

53:18.840 --> 53:19.840
 I hope so.

53:19.840 --> 53:21.340
 I mean, imagine not,

53:21.340 --> 53:24.040
 imagine someone whose politics weren't all over the place.

53:24.040 --> 53:26.040
 It would seem odd.

53:26.040 --> 53:26.880
 Right.

53:26.880 --> 53:28.760
 In the 10 years that I've been politically conscious,

53:28.760 --> 53:30.360
 just because I'm 35 and 20.

53:30.360 --> 53:32.200
 No, I've probably been conscious for over two decades,

53:32.200 --> 53:34.600
 but like Democrats have become Republicans,

53:34.600 --> 53:36.560
 Republicans become Democrats.

53:36.560 --> 53:37.920
 I remember when Ann Coulter said,

53:37.920 --> 53:40.120
 we need to, he defended George W. Bush when he said,

53:40.120 --> 53:41.880
 we need to go out and Christianize

53:41.880 --> 53:44.080
 or modernize the Arab world.

53:44.080 --> 53:45.800
 We need to democratize the Arab world.

53:45.800 --> 53:48.460
 And then Ann Coulter backed Donald Trump.

53:48.460 --> 53:50.800
 And all the right wing in America believed

53:50.800 --> 53:51.920
 in nation building.

53:51.920 --> 53:56.140
 They believed in going out and democratizing areas

53:56.140 --> 53:58.560
 that might breed radical terrorists,

53:58.560 --> 54:01.040
 whether it was Iraq or wherever you were going,

54:01.040 --> 54:03.640
 toppling regimes and instituting

54:03.640 --> 54:05.760
 new democratic norms in those countries.

54:05.760 --> 54:07.760
 That was the right wing point of view when I grew up.

54:07.760 --> 54:11.080
 Then the right wing switched to,

54:11.080 --> 54:13.200
 we are going to be isolationist.

54:13.200 --> 54:15.120
 We're going to take care of America.

54:15.120 --> 54:16.280
 First and foremost,

54:16.280 --> 54:18.240
 we're not going to go into other countries.

54:18.240 --> 54:20.040
 And then the Democrats who, when I grew up,

54:20.040 --> 54:23.960
 were doves and the right wing people were more hawkish.

54:23.960 --> 54:24.800
 And the Democrats were like,

54:24.800 --> 54:27.680
 the military solutions aren't the way.

54:27.680 --> 54:30.700
 We need to have multilateral diplomatic coalitions

54:30.700 --> 54:32.280
 to solve all the problems.

54:32.280 --> 54:34.000
 Now, Rachel Maddow's like,

54:34.000 --> 54:37.360
 let's nuke Russia every night on MSNBC.

54:37.360 --> 54:38.480
 The Democrats are like,

54:38.480 --> 54:41.960
 we need strong presence in Syria.

54:41.960 --> 54:43.400
 We need a strong presence.

54:43.400 --> 54:45.640
 We need to counter Putin all over the globe.

54:45.640 --> 54:48.040
 We need to get, so they're more hawkish on things.

54:48.040 --> 54:52.360
 So literally I have watched two political parties

54:52.360 --> 54:54.920
 literally flip and it's crazy to watch.

54:54.920 --> 54:58.100
 And in some sense I've watched that as well

54:58.100 --> 55:01.100
 because when I first saw Barack Obama,

55:01.100 --> 55:03.440
 I admired that he was against the war.

55:03.440 --> 55:07.600
 This is whatever, maybe before he was a Senator,

55:07.600 --> 55:10.200
 he spoke out against the Iraq war.

55:10.200 --> 55:15.200
 And then it doesn't feel like,

55:17.240 --> 55:20.240
 it feels like his administration was more hawkish

55:20.240 --> 55:25.240
 than dovish in a sense with all the drone attacks,

55:25.680 --> 55:28.280
 with the sort of inability to pull back,

55:28.280 --> 55:31.600
 or at least in mass efficiently pull back

55:31.600 --> 55:33.560
 from all the military involvement

55:33.560 --> 55:34.840
 that we have all over the world.

55:34.840 --> 55:36.360
 So, and just the language.

55:36.360 --> 55:37.840
 What I think is interesting about that,

55:37.840 --> 55:38.880
 what's interesting about Obama,

55:38.880 --> 55:40.560
 cause this is a very interesting study,

55:40.560 --> 55:43.960
 is that presidents are controlled in very different ways.

55:43.960 --> 55:48.000
 Presidents can be controlled by different factors,

55:48.000 --> 55:51.040
 power factions within Washington.

55:51.040 --> 55:54.600
 I think one of the reasons that Obama was maybe,

55:54.600 --> 55:56.400
 you had a very close relationship with John Brennan,

55:56.400 --> 55:58.040
 he was a CIA director.

55:58.040 --> 56:00.440
 And Obama was very close with John Brennan,

56:00.440 --> 56:05.440
 and Obama was very, I think malleable to the extent

56:07.040 --> 56:09.720
 that the CIA, and I've had CIA agents on my show,

56:09.720 --> 56:13.320
 John Kiriakou, a guy who went to jail for exposing torture,

56:13.320 --> 56:16.160
 was saying that like, you get into the Oval Office,

56:16.160 --> 56:17.000
 all of a sudden you're having

56:17.000 --> 56:18.860
 that presidential daily briefing every day,

56:18.860 --> 56:21.040
 and the intelligence people come in and they go,

56:21.040 --> 56:23.720
 listen man, I mean, there's gonna be a terrorist attack

56:23.720 --> 56:25.880
 on your watch if you don't do X, Y, and Z.

56:25.880 --> 56:28.960
 They go, they call it like blue book information,

56:28.960 --> 56:30.720
 which is five levels above top secret,

56:30.720 --> 56:35.520
 and they go like, hey man, a guy in Iran at a cafe

56:35.520 --> 56:36.960
 said he's blowing everything up next week,

56:36.960 --> 56:38.440
 and you know, I mean, it's the same thing as Parler,

56:38.440 --> 56:39.960
 you don't know if it's true or not.

56:39.960 --> 56:41.600
 But now the president's making a decision

56:41.600 --> 56:44.920
 on usually a lot of uncorroborated intelligence

56:44.920 --> 56:48.160
 that goes into a presentation for the president,

56:48.160 --> 56:49.520
 where you're just terrified every day,

56:49.520 --> 56:51.560
 and you don't want a terrorist attack on your watch.

56:51.560 --> 56:53.720
 Now, so why are they getting all this information?

56:53.720 --> 56:56.600
 Because a lot of the people in Washington

56:56.600 --> 57:00.040
 have an interest in perpetual, constant, ongoing warfare,

57:00.040 --> 57:02.680
 and there's a lot of financial gain to be had from that.

57:02.680 --> 57:04.400
 So they're sneaking their information

57:04.400 --> 57:07.200
 into the presentations that are going to the president,

57:07.200 --> 57:09.200
 and then the president is now behaving and going,

57:09.200 --> 57:11.680
 fuck, I don't want a bomb going off,

57:11.680 --> 57:13.360
 we gotta do what we gotta do.

57:13.360 --> 57:16.600
 And whatever version of that happens,

57:16.600 --> 57:18.520
 that is really kind of what is happening,

57:18.520 --> 57:21.920
 whereas the presidents are being controlled

57:21.920 --> 57:25.600
 by forces that are outside of the political sphere,

57:25.600 --> 57:27.240
 but very much still in it.

57:27.240 --> 57:29.000
 And they have a lot of, that's what the deep state is.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.200
 You know, Trump, there's a lot of ridiculing Trump

57:31.200 --> 57:33.440
 of going, the deep state doesn't exist.

57:33.440 --> 57:35.200
 It absolutely exists, there's been books about it

57:35.200 --> 57:36.800
 written by liberal journalists.

57:36.800 --> 57:41.800
 The deep state is only a term for unelected, largely,

57:42.000 --> 57:44.840
 power factions in Washington, DC,

57:44.840 --> 57:47.880
 that outlive any presidential administration.

57:47.880 --> 57:50.240
 These are people that might work at the State Department,

57:50.240 --> 57:52.640
 they might work at the Defense Department.

57:52.640 --> 57:56.320
 These are people that are not always working officially

57:56.320 --> 57:57.880
 in any government capacity.

57:57.880 --> 58:00.000
 They might be private companies,

58:00.000 --> 58:02.840
 they might be military contractors,

58:02.840 --> 58:04.920
 they might be people at Boeing or Raytheon

58:04.920 --> 58:06.200
 or General Dynamics.

58:06.200 --> 58:10.680
 And they constitute a group of people

58:10.680 --> 58:11.920
 that Trump kind of called the swamp,

58:11.920 --> 58:14.080
 but Trump had really no interest in draining the swamp.

58:14.080 --> 58:18.720
 But he articulated these things, and this is what it is.

58:18.720 --> 58:22.920
 You have a lot of interested parties that have budgets

58:22.920 --> 58:24.600
 that they want, big budgets.

58:24.600 --> 58:26.320
 Everybody wants a budget in Washington,

58:26.320 --> 58:29.320
 whether you know what it is, they want money.

58:29.320 --> 58:31.680
 And these are the people who really control press.

58:31.680 --> 58:34.120
 So this idea that the president is the be all end all

58:34.120 --> 58:35.280
 has got to be smashed,

58:35.280 --> 58:38.080
 which is why the horse race model of politics

58:38.080 --> 58:39.360
 and being like, is it right wing?

58:39.360 --> 58:40.360
 Is it left wing?

58:40.360 --> 58:43.560
 Is it, what team am I on and what color am I wearing?

58:43.560 --> 58:47.240
 It's very simplistic, but the reality is this is an empire.

58:47.240 --> 58:49.080
 It's past its peak.

58:49.080 --> 58:50.000
 We're in trouble.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.920
 The United States is an empire past its peak.

58:51.920 --> 58:53.440
 Yeah, I mean, that's just,

58:53.440 --> 58:55.960
 you could prove that case in court.

58:55.960 --> 58:57.480
 Well, let's go to court right now.

58:57.480 --> 59:01.360
 But I do love the more complex idea

59:01.360 --> 59:04.560
 that there's just human beings who crave power

59:04.560 --> 59:08.120
 and seek ways to attain that power through different ways.

59:08.120 --> 59:13.040
 If you have Barack Obama or George Bush or Donald Trump,

59:13.040 --> 59:15.160
 there's different attack vectors.

59:15.160 --> 59:16.000
 Correct.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.680
 There's different ways to attain that power

59:17.680 --> 59:19.120
 and then you can use that to leverage.

59:19.120 --> 59:23.480
 And it probably doesn't have to be just in Washington, DC.

59:23.480 --> 59:26.560
 There's people who crave power all over the world.

59:26.560 --> 59:29.360
 Of course, but where we are now in Los Angeles,

59:29.360 --> 59:30.720
 these people are all good.

59:31.560 --> 59:32.400
 LA.

59:32.400 --> 59:33.800
 Studio executives and people that I,

59:33.800 --> 59:36.360
 from what I understand, they treat everyone fairly

59:36.360 --> 59:40.560
 and they're nice, but he sees the bad guys,

59:40.560 --> 59:43.680
 but out here in LA, everyone's lovely.

59:43.680 --> 59:48.680
 So amidst this fun exploration in your mind

59:48.880 --> 59:50.640
 through the political landscape that you've done

59:50.640 --> 59:54.040
 over the past couple of decades

59:54.040 --> 59:56.520
 that you've been conscious politically,

59:56.520 --> 59:59.640
 where does Donald Trump fit into this picture for you?

1:00:01.520 --> 1:00:02.800
 Great question.

1:00:02.800 --> 1:00:04.080
 Well, he didn't, right?

1:00:04.080 --> 1:00:06.120
 Cause we didn't, he wasn't political

1:00:06.120 --> 1:00:07.800
 until four years ago, right?

1:00:07.800 --> 1:00:10.400
 He got political very quickly before.

1:00:10.400 --> 1:00:12.040
 I mean, he was always firing off crazy tweets

1:00:12.040 --> 1:00:14.040
 about where Obama was born or whatever,

1:00:14.040 --> 1:00:17.880
 but he was, he got into politics like very quickly

1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:19.200
 and then he became the president, right?

1:00:19.200 --> 1:00:22.040
 So it was like, we didn't, I knew him as Donald Trump,

1:00:22.040 --> 1:00:23.760
 this crazy New York city character,

1:00:23.760 --> 1:00:26.000
 the coast of the apprentice.

1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:27.440
 I didn't think much about him.

1:00:27.440 --> 1:00:29.080
 He was just constant, you know,

1:00:29.080 --> 1:00:31.280
 like he was just this constant figure.

1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:33.000
 Like I don't think much about Warren Buffett.

1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:34.160
 Like I know like Trump's like,

1:00:34.160 --> 1:00:37.640
 he's married to a new show girl all the time

1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:41.000
 and he's always opening another casino and he's on TV.

1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:41.960
 Wait, Warren Buffett really?

1:00:41.960 --> 1:00:42.800
 No, Trump.

1:00:42.800 --> 1:00:44.920
 Trump, but like Warren Buffett is the opposite, right?

1:00:44.920 --> 1:00:47.440
 Warren Buffett's like been married for a billion years,

1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:48.680
 lives in a little house in Omaha,

1:00:48.680 --> 1:00:50.360
 but these are the, that's what I associate Trump.

1:00:50.360 --> 1:00:52.200
 Like I don't think about Warren Buffett.

1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:53.560
 I don't think about these people.

1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:55.640
 They're just guys that I've known forever

1:00:55.640 --> 1:00:57.960
 that have like, you know,

1:01:00.320 --> 1:01:02.520
 you associate certain things with them, right?

1:01:02.520 --> 1:01:04.760
 And Trump, we always associated with kind of vulgar,

1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:08.280
 garish, new money, billionaire, married a lot,

1:01:08.280 --> 1:01:10.760
 you know, casinos, Miss Universe pageants.

1:01:10.760 --> 1:01:13.640
 But again, you know, but it makes perfect sense

1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:18.640
 that he really was able to become president at the moment

1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:22.520
 where we were about to have Hillary Clinton versus Jeb Bush.

1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:24.720
 And I think Americans felt like this is,

1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:27.560
 now the oligarchy is spitting right in our face.

1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:29.520
 You're not even making it feel like

1:01:30.400 --> 1:01:32.520
 there's an appearance of democracy.

1:01:32.520 --> 1:01:34.240
 We have two crime families

1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:37.080
 vowing for control of the country every four years.

1:01:37.080 --> 1:01:40.480
 And then there was this rogue kind of upstart guy

1:01:40.480 --> 1:01:42.320
 that was really about himself.

1:01:42.320 --> 1:01:44.440
 You know, Trump doesn't really care that much about the,

1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:46.640
 I mean, really was summarized perfectly when he left

1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:48.640
 and he just said, hey, have a good life.

1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:49.480
 That's what he said

1:01:49.480 --> 1:01:51.160
 before he got on Andrews Air Force Base.

1:01:51.160 --> 1:01:53.720
 If you watch his speech, he goes, hey, have a good life.

1:01:53.720 --> 1:01:56.520
 That's what he really feel.

1:01:56.520 --> 1:01:58.360
 Like, hey, have a good life.

1:01:58.360 --> 1:02:00.640
 I'm gonna get on a plane right now

1:02:00.640 --> 1:02:05.560
 and fly to a castle I own in Florida.

1:02:05.560 --> 1:02:08.960
 And really, I'm not gonna think too much about you people

1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:12.280
 outside of how I can get more attention in the future.

1:02:12.280 --> 1:02:14.800
 Can I ask you like a therapy question?

1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:17.680
 What is your favorite

1:02:17.680 --> 1:02:20.720
 and least favorite quality of Donald Trump?

1:02:21.640 --> 1:02:24.920
 So my least favorite quality of Donald Trump,

1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:28.760
 I think because there's a few of them,

1:02:28.760 --> 1:02:33.400
 his lack of empathy,

1:02:33.400 --> 1:02:35.160
 complete and total lack of empathy.

1:02:35.160 --> 1:02:39.160
 I don't feel that he cares about human beings on any level.

1:02:39.160 --> 1:02:40.680
 And I feel like that's,

1:02:40.680 --> 1:02:43.560
 maybe it should be a requirement, right?

1:02:43.560 --> 1:02:45.160
 I mean, I don't think he cares.

1:02:45.160 --> 1:02:46.480
 I think it's obvious that he doesn't care.

1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:49.240
 I mean, he sent, you know, basically he's saying like,

1:02:49.240 --> 1:02:50.640
 they're in there, Mike Pence is in there.

1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:53.800
 He knows that his people are going to get,

1:02:53.800 --> 1:02:54.640
 try to get into a Capitol.

1:02:54.640 --> 1:02:56.800
 I mean, those motherfuckers are not gonna have jobs.

1:02:56.800 --> 1:03:00.640
 They're gonna go to federal prison and he doesn't care.

1:03:00.640 --> 1:03:02.200
 As long as they're storming the Capitol

1:03:02.200 --> 1:03:04.720
 to prove the point that he thinks he won the election,

1:03:04.720 --> 1:03:08.960
 he has no concern for these people, his followers.

1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:11.240
 He leads them lambs to the slaughter, right?

1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:13.600
 So that's not a respectable quality.

1:03:13.600 --> 1:03:16.040
 My favorite quality of Donald Trump

1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:18.560
 is his willingness to call bullshit.

1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:20.200
 So his willingness to call bullshit out.

1:03:20.200 --> 1:03:22.400
 He doesn't play the game.

1:03:22.400 --> 1:03:24.440
 He will, you know, when people say about Putin,

1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:25.520
 Putin kills people, he goes,

1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:26.720
 we kill a lot of people here too.

1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:31.320
 Like he's willing and able to break the fourth wall

1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:33.360
 and say things that no politician has ever said.

1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:36.800
 He's willing to call out hypocrisy, you know,

1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:40.120
 of course not his own, but the media,

1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:41.800
 the members of the political establishment,

1:03:41.800 --> 1:03:43.200
 that's a laudable quality.

1:03:43.200 --> 1:03:45.320
 It's an entertaining quality, right?

1:03:45.320 --> 1:03:46.240
 We all like it.

1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:48.120
 I love, I'm like this guy saying something

1:03:48.120 --> 1:03:49.760
 that a lot of people want said.

1:03:50.880 --> 1:03:54.080
 That being said, it's coupled with no real work or action.

1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:56.520
 So it's not coupled with anything behind it

1:03:56.520 --> 1:03:58.400
 that he just wants to,

1:03:58.400 --> 1:03:59.800
 we did an episode of my podcast once

1:03:59.800 --> 1:04:01.160
 where it's like essentially he's like criticizing

1:04:01.160 --> 1:04:03.400
 the deep state, he wants a deeper state.

1:04:03.400 --> 1:04:04.440
 He wants a deeper state.

1:04:04.440 --> 1:04:07.880
 Like he hired his daughter and her husband.

1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:09.600
 I mean, this is not a guy that's interested

1:04:09.600 --> 1:04:11.400
 in transparency and openness.

1:04:11.400 --> 1:04:13.840
 He's a guy that would just prefer,

1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:16.720
 he wants to run the mafia state.

1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:20.760
 But he shakes up the norms of social discourse,

1:04:20.760 --> 1:04:22.520
 political discourse, and that people

1:04:22.520 --> 1:04:24.560
 are just hungry for that.

1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:26.960
 Like he got banned from Twitter,

1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:29.080
 from all the different platforms.

1:04:29.080 --> 1:04:31.560
 Do you think, is there an argument to be made

1:04:31.560 --> 1:04:33.400
 for and against banning Twitter?

1:04:33.400 --> 1:04:35.680
 There's always arguments to be made for everything.

1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:38.200
 A permanent ban seems to be an overreaction to me.

1:04:38.200 --> 1:04:39.720
 He's the president of the United States.

1:04:39.720 --> 1:04:41.160
 It also rearranges the power,

1:04:41.160 --> 1:04:42.440
 like whether you like him or hate him,

1:04:42.440 --> 1:04:45.520
 love him or hate him, he was the president.

1:04:45.520 --> 1:04:47.680
 We've elevated Twitter is now more powerful

1:04:47.680 --> 1:04:48.760
 than the president.

1:04:48.760 --> 1:04:51.200
 It's like, do you want that to be longterm the salute,

1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:53.920
 that the reality, like now Jack at Twitter

1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:56.520
 is more powerful than the president of the United States.

1:04:56.520 --> 1:05:00.040
 Is that a good paradigm going forward?

1:05:00.040 --> 1:05:01.440
 I don't know.

1:05:01.440 --> 1:05:03.600
 I'm not, listen, maybe give him a little time out

1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:05.000
 for a few days.

1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:08.320
 I think a time out, a little spanking, certainly,

1:05:08.320 --> 1:05:10.840
 but I don't know if a permanent ban across the board

1:05:10.840 --> 1:05:11.920
 on every social media.

1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:13.240
 I mean, they banned them on Grindr.

1:05:13.240 --> 1:05:14.920
 I mean, this is how hilarious it is, right?

1:05:14.920 --> 1:05:17.560
 I mean, they banned them across the board on everything.

1:05:17.560 --> 1:05:19.760
 I don't think he could get an Airbnb now, neither can I,

1:05:19.760 --> 1:05:22.800
 but like, I don't think he can do anything.

1:05:22.800 --> 1:05:25.320
 Again, I just, I look back and there's so many people,

1:05:25.320 --> 1:05:26.760
 my very smart, intelligent friends that go,

1:05:26.760 --> 1:05:27.680
 yeah, but who cares?

1:05:27.680 --> 1:05:28.760
 Yeah, but he's bad.

1:05:28.760 --> 1:05:29.760
 Yeah, but blah, blah, blah.

1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:31.360
 Yeah, but I don't like Milianopolis.

1:05:31.360 --> 1:05:32.800
 Yeah, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1:05:32.800 --> 1:05:35.280
 And I'm like, you have such faith.

1:05:35.280 --> 1:05:39.040
 You have such faith that it's always gonna be the people

1:05:39.040 --> 1:05:40.560
 you dislike that are banned.

1:05:40.560 --> 1:05:43.120
 It's always gonna be the, it's never gonna be you.

1:05:43.120 --> 1:05:45.320
 Man, you have so much faith in the government.

1:05:45.320 --> 1:05:48.160
 You have so much faith in tech oligarchs you've never met.

1:05:48.160 --> 1:05:51.440
 You have so much faith in the security state

1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:53.720
 that they're gonna always make the right decisions

1:05:53.720 --> 1:05:55.560
 and they're not gonna penalize people

1:05:55.560 --> 1:05:56.880
 that shouldn't be penalized.

1:05:56.880 --> 1:06:00.400
 To me, I'm like, wow, I've never had that much faith

1:06:00.400 --> 1:06:02.200
 in any human being ever, including myself.

1:06:02.200 --> 1:06:03.680
 I wouldn't want that power.

1:06:03.680 --> 1:06:05.840
 I would start deplatforming people that I hate.

1:06:05.840 --> 1:06:08.400
 I would deplatform my aunt, you know what I mean?

1:06:08.400 --> 1:06:10.640
 I would deplatform everyone I know.

1:06:10.640 --> 1:06:14.160
 I mean, so it's such an insane power to give somebody,

1:06:14.160 --> 1:06:16.840
 like who gets heard, who gets to speak?

1:06:16.840 --> 1:06:18.520
 Yeah, I'm worried about the effect it has

1:06:18.520 --> 1:06:20.080
 on people like you, actually.

1:06:20.080 --> 1:06:20.920
 I agree.

1:06:20.920 --> 1:06:24.520
 Of being, like everybody's a little more nervous

1:06:25.800 --> 1:06:27.480
 in what they say.

1:06:27.480 --> 1:06:28.320
 Correct.

1:06:28.320 --> 1:06:29.440
 And that is a big problem.

1:06:29.440 --> 1:06:30.280
 Yes.

1:06:30.280 --> 1:06:32.800
 Because then you're just like longterm unmasked,

1:06:32.800 --> 1:06:33.720
 like we're talking about.

1:06:33.720 --> 1:06:37.640
 It has an effect where people just become more bland.

1:06:37.640 --> 1:06:41.880
 Yeah, self censorship, anxiety,

1:06:41.880 --> 1:06:43.320
 all of these things go into it.

1:06:43.320 --> 1:06:44.160
 We try to fight it.

1:06:44.160 --> 1:06:44.980
 I try to fight it.

1:06:44.980 --> 1:06:47.120
 I think I gotta still do what makes me laugh

1:06:47.120 --> 1:06:49.480
 and what makes me laugh is often fucked up.

1:06:49.480 --> 1:06:52.640
 And it's often, it's not always fucked up in a way

1:06:52.640 --> 1:06:54.200
 that it's gonna get me thrown off something,

1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:58.400
 but I think pushing certain buttons is funny to me,

1:06:58.400 --> 1:07:00.320
 so I gotta keep doing that.

1:07:00.320 --> 1:07:02.560
 Part of the problem is that so many of the lines

1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:03.400
 are blurred, right?

1:07:03.400 --> 1:07:05.800
 So you have comedians that are commentators

1:07:05.800 --> 1:07:08.360
 and commentators that are comedians and politicians.

1:07:08.360 --> 1:07:10.080
 So it's harder to get the defense of like,

1:07:10.080 --> 1:07:11.820
 hey, I'm a comedian, leave me alone.

1:07:11.820 --> 1:07:13.000
 That defense becomes harder

1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.840
 when all of these lines are blurring.

1:07:15.840 --> 1:07:18.180
 Everybody's kind of everything now.

1:07:18.180 --> 1:07:21.200
 So like people say to me, you should run for office

1:07:21.200 --> 1:07:22.960
 and they're serious and I'm like, you're crazy,

1:07:22.960 --> 1:07:23.800
 but they're serious.

1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:26.740
 Like, so the blurring of everything means

1:07:26.740 --> 1:07:29.240
 that people aren't in their lanes as much

1:07:29.240 --> 1:07:31.960
 and that you go, well, this guy is dangerous

1:07:31.960 --> 1:07:34.640
 because he's not just making a joke.

1:07:34.640 --> 1:07:38.000
 He's doing something else and he's using humor.

1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:38.960
 And I'm like, I'm really not.

1:07:38.960 --> 1:07:40.320
 I'm really just trying to make a joke.

1:07:40.320 --> 1:07:42.120
 That's all, that's really what I'm trying to do.

1:07:42.120 --> 1:07:46.000
 But I do think that because of the flattening,

1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:48.140
 there's a lot of people out there that go,

1:07:48.140 --> 1:07:49.920
 they take aim at humor because they go,

1:07:49.920 --> 1:07:54.120
 humor is where bad ideas can kind of start and flourish.

1:07:54.120 --> 1:07:57.960
 But don't you, to put some responsibility on you,

1:07:57.960 --> 1:08:00.160
 don't you think humor is a way to,

1:08:01.120 --> 1:08:03.360
 that you are the modern,

1:08:03.360 --> 1:08:05.920
 like Jordan Peterson style intellectual,

1:08:05.920 --> 1:08:08.160
 that humor is actually a tool of.

1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:09.000
 It can be.

1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:10.040
 Changing the zeitgeist,

1:08:10.040 --> 1:08:11.760
 changing the social norms. It absolutely can be,

1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:12.920
 but it also cannot be.

1:08:12.920 --> 1:08:14.400
 I don't think it's any one thing

1:08:14.400 --> 1:08:17.560
 and I think there's a lot of pressure for a comedian.

1:08:17.560 --> 1:08:18.960
 You can be funny and right.

1:08:18.960 --> 1:08:21.080
 You can be funny and wrong.

1:08:21.080 --> 1:08:22.880
 If your goal is to be right,

1:08:22.880 --> 1:08:25.600
 you might end up being right and not funny.

1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:27.840
 So the reality is funny has to come first.

1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:30.160
 There are brilliant people that have been funny

1:08:30.160 --> 1:08:33.240
 and correct according to people, right?

1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:35.040
 But at the end of the day,

1:08:35.040 --> 1:08:38.340
 people that put way too much faith in what comedy is,

1:08:38.340 --> 1:08:39.720
 most of what comedy is,

1:08:39.720 --> 1:08:41.560
 is people showing up to strip malls

1:08:41.560 --> 1:08:43.800
 and telling jokes for an hour

1:08:43.800 --> 1:08:45.160
 while people eat chicken fingers

1:08:45.160 --> 1:08:46.620
 and they all get drunk and they laugh

1:08:46.620 --> 1:08:48.800
 and they feel a little bit better about their lives.

1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:50.520
 That's really the majority of comedy.

1:08:50.520 --> 1:08:53.240
 Then there's like 10 famous people that are really famous

1:08:53.240 --> 1:08:55.760
 that do a version of that in an arena.

1:08:55.760 --> 1:08:57.720
 But the amount of cultural power they have

1:08:57.720 --> 1:08:59.640
 has always been greatly exaggerated.

1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:01.440
 My uncles loved George Carlin,

1:09:01.440 --> 1:09:03.760
 who was anti military industrial complex,

1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:05.200
 anti this, anti that.

1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:07.040
 And then they would go vote for Ronald Reagan.

1:09:07.040 --> 1:09:07.960
 They didn't care.

1:09:10.920 --> 1:09:12.800
 It's not as powerful as you think.

1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:13.960
 I wish it was.

1:09:13.960 --> 1:09:15.280
 It feels good.

1:09:15.280 --> 1:09:18.440
 It feels good for me to say I am the new thing.

1:09:18.440 --> 1:09:19.680
 It really isn't.

1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:20.680
 It truly isn't.

1:09:20.680 --> 1:09:23.040
 No one is, comedians are the people that get on stage

1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:24.420
 and say, we're fucked up.

1:09:24.420 --> 1:09:26.200
 We're drug addicts.

1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:27.100
 We're sex addicts.

1:09:27.100 --> 1:09:28.120
 We're fat.

1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:28.960
 We're gross.

1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:29.920
 We can't manage our money.

1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:31.160
 We can't stop eating.

1:09:31.160 --> 1:09:33.120
 We can't stop fucking doing horrible things.

1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:33.960
 We're liars.

1:09:33.960 --> 1:09:34.780
 We're narcissists.

1:09:34.780 --> 1:09:35.640
 We're scumbags.

1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:37.480
 We're the people that get out and say that.

1:09:37.480 --> 1:09:40.620
 Only a psychopath would look at us and go,

1:09:40.620 --> 1:09:42.240
 show me the way.

1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:43.680
 Like it's not.

1:09:43.680 --> 1:09:46.880
 I disagree with you because then I'm a psychopath.

1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:50.680
 Well, and that's, I mean, I don't think,

1:09:50.680 --> 1:09:51.520
 no pushback here.

1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:54.720
 That's another issue.

1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:55.560
 But you know what I'm saying.

1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:58.000
 Well, and I don't because, I mean,

1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:01.040
 I understand you using this as a psychological tool

1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:03.600
 for yourself to give yourself freedom.

1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:06.800
 But the reality is you are one of the rare comedians

1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:10.680
 like a George Carlin who is, besides being funny.

1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:11.800
 When I hear things like that, I'm like,

1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:12.820
 okay, you're being very sweet.

1:10:12.820 --> 1:10:14.080
 But like, I agree.

1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:14.920
 I understand what you're saying.

1:10:14.920 --> 1:10:17.240
 I do stuff that makes, hopefully makes you think.

1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:18.840
 I hope that's what good comedy is.

1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:21.040
 But I think I try to do that.

1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:25.840
 But I also would hate to feel shackled to the idea

1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:28.440
 of that I had to make a point

1:10:28.440 --> 1:10:31.320
 and that point had to be correct.

1:10:31.320 --> 1:10:33.600
 I think the best comedy makes fun of everything.

1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:34.800
 It makes fun of both sides.

1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:38.200
 And then there's a deeper truth about humanity revealed.

1:10:38.200 --> 1:10:40.480
 But then what happens is people take that deeper truth

1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:42.080
 and go, let's politicize it.

1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:43.080
 But what does he mean?

1:10:43.080 --> 1:10:44.160
 Is it the right or the left?

1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:46.440
 And I'm like, I'm doing something that I think speaks

1:10:46.440 --> 1:10:49.120
 to hopefully people on both sides for everybody.

1:10:49.120 --> 1:10:51.080
 Cause I'm making fun of people on the left and the right

1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:52.600
 and in the center and people that don't care

1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:53.480
 and people that do care.

1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:55.520
 And I'm trying to figure out a way to do it.

1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:57.360
 But then immediately anything of value

1:10:57.360 --> 1:10:59.680
 in this culture right now is like, how do we politicize it?

1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:00.960
 How do we put it in a box?

1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:02.920
 So yes, I think comedy can produce a lot

1:11:02.920 --> 1:11:07.240
 of inherently valuable things, reflective, thoughtful things.

1:11:07.240 --> 1:11:10.440
 But then immediately, can it be put in this box

1:11:10.440 --> 1:11:13.000
 where all of those things can be used politically?

1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:14.040
 No.

1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:15.280
 And unfortunately, like when they say like,

1:11:15.280 --> 1:11:17.120
 comedy is a great way to speak truth to power.

1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:22.120
 It is, but I don't know how much it changes things.

1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:28.480
 I don't know how much a joke can dethrone a king.

1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:30.760
 I know the idea is nice,

1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:34.320
 but let's look at the practical applications.

1:11:34.320 --> 1:11:38.100
 I mean, we had brilliant comics, Bill Hicks,

1:11:38.100 --> 1:11:40.640
 George Carlin, Richard Pryor.

1:11:40.640 --> 1:11:44.120
 We had people talk about so many problems in society,

1:11:44.120 --> 1:11:47.380
 illustrate them, put a spotlight on them.

1:11:47.380 --> 1:11:48.760
 And we still have them.

1:11:48.760 --> 1:11:50.520
 They're worse now than they've ever been.

1:11:50.520 --> 1:11:51.360
 That's not true.

1:11:51.360 --> 1:11:52.640
 I think the society is better.

1:11:52.640 --> 1:11:55.120
 And so to push back in my perspective,

1:11:55.120 --> 1:11:58.000
 it's very possible that those voices

1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:00.160
 were the exact reason we have the world today,

1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:01.980
 which I do believe is actually,

1:12:03.160 --> 1:12:07.080
 I mean, on the boring old measures

1:12:07.080 --> 1:12:08.760
 of what makes a good world,

1:12:08.760 --> 1:12:12.160
 which is the amount of violence in the world,

1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:15.640
 the amount of opportunity that all those kinds of measures,

1:12:15.640 --> 1:12:17.800
 even happiness, all of those things measured,

1:12:17.800 --> 1:12:19.040
 things have been improving.

1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:21.400
 Steven Pinker gets a lot of shit for this,

1:12:21.400 --> 1:12:23.720
 but he's really good at articulating

1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:25.240
 how the data says pretty clearly

1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:26.720
 that the world is getting better.

1:12:26.720 --> 1:12:30.960
 And it's arguable that the freedoms we do enjoy currently

1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:34.680
 are thanks to the comedic voices or the people who mock.

1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:37.600
 So to me, it's possible that humor

1:12:37.600 --> 1:12:39.480
 is the very thing that saves the world.

1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:41.520
 Humor is the very thing that keeps,

1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:44.040
 is the balance of power in the world.

1:12:44.040 --> 1:12:46.320
 But I think a lot of the things that those guys criticize,

1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:50.120
 whether it was militarism or the elites,

1:12:50.120 --> 1:12:52.280
 the lying, the corruption, the bribery,

1:12:52.280 --> 1:12:53.560
 that's still going on.

1:12:53.560 --> 1:12:54.720
 And it's always gonna go on, right?

1:12:54.720 --> 1:12:56.320
 Because that's the nature of human beings.

1:12:56.320 --> 1:12:58.600
 We call it out, we point it out,

1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:01.000
 but we don't have a plan to change.

1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:02.640
 It's not really our job.

1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:05.520
 And I think that too much now is like,

1:13:05.520 --> 1:13:07.320
 well, comedians should have a,

1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:09.520
 like, I don't tell people who to vote for.

1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:10.680
 Like the idea that comedians

1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:11.640
 went and told people who to vote for,

1:13:11.640 --> 1:13:13.160
 it's like, to me, it's crazy.

1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:15.520
 I understand like people have strong opinions,

1:13:15.520 --> 1:13:17.920
 but like, I believe I have a job.

1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:19.880
 And my job is to make you laugh or whatever,

1:13:19.880 --> 1:13:20.760
 maybe make you think,

1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:23.120
 but like, my job is not to tell you who to vote for.

1:13:23.120 --> 1:13:24.160
 I mean, it's absurd.

1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:27.760
 But see, the thing you do by the comedy,

1:13:27.760 --> 1:13:29.040
 like on your Twitter,

1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:30.360
 that people should definitely follow.

1:13:30.360 --> 1:13:33.720
 I believe that, Jim J. Dillon, I agree with you.

1:13:33.720 --> 1:13:35.800
 Oh, on this point of,

1:13:35.800 --> 1:13:37.120
 I agree with you wholeheartedly.

1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:38.520
 That people should follow you.

1:13:38.520 --> 1:13:40.920
 Yeah, you give me,

1:13:40.920 --> 1:13:45.040
 you give me freedom to think on my own.

1:13:45.040 --> 1:13:47.280
 Meaning like you're shaking things up

1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:49.640
 to where I don't feel constrained

1:13:49.640 --> 1:13:51.520
 about what I can think about.

1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:52.760
 And that's awesome.

1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:54.840
 Thank you.

1:13:54.840 --> 1:13:56.160
 So you're not telling me what to think,

1:13:56.160 --> 1:13:57.480
 you're giving me the freedom to think.

1:13:57.480 --> 1:13:59.400
 And that's what great comedy does,

1:13:59.400 --> 1:14:04.080
 is I don't often agree with George Carlin.

1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:06.840
 He can get pretty political sometimes.

1:14:06.840 --> 1:14:10.240
 But just the ability to do that's so rare.

1:14:10.240 --> 1:14:11.680
 Podcasts do that too now.

1:14:11.680 --> 1:14:12.760
 Like there's certain people

1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:15.800
 that can really just challenge you to,

1:14:15.800 --> 1:14:16.920
 even when you disagree with them,

1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:17.760
 to sort of be like,

1:14:17.760 --> 1:14:19.680
 oh, it's okay to think about this kind of stuff.

1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:21.040
 Yeah, and I appreciate that,

1:14:21.040 --> 1:14:21.880
 because that's awesome.

1:14:21.880 --> 1:14:23.080
 And I mean, that's great.

1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:25.280
 And a guy like you, who's a brilliant guy, that's great.

1:14:25.280 --> 1:14:28.080
 If I'm giving you the license to think,

1:14:28.080 --> 1:14:30.560
 then man, the world is completely fucked.

1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:31.680
 But I'm happy about that.

1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:32.520
 Yeah.

1:14:32.520 --> 1:14:33.360
 No, it's...

1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:35.680
 Well, you know.

1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:38.520
 Speaking about the world being completely fucked,

1:14:38.520 --> 1:14:40.640
 Alex Jones turned on QAnon.

1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:41.480
 I know almost nothing...

1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:42.440
 It's a very tough match.

1:14:42.440 --> 1:14:43.640
 They had a rough marriage.

1:14:43.640 --> 1:14:44.600
 They fought it.

1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:46.680
 They fought it out for years.

1:14:46.680 --> 1:14:48.200
 And eventually we just knew

1:14:48.200 --> 1:14:50.520
 someone was gonna leave someone.

1:14:50.520 --> 1:14:52.800
 Hewlett tried to leave him a few months ago.

1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:53.640
 Oh, so...

1:14:53.640 --> 1:14:55.520
 Yeah, he was staying at someone else's house.

1:14:55.520 --> 1:14:57.080
 The car wasn't in the driveway.

1:14:57.080 --> 1:14:58.560
 Yeah.

1:14:58.560 --> 1:15:01.680
 Well, the thing about QAnon that makes it a lot of fun

1:15:01.680 --> 1:15:04.000
 is it's kind of a make it up as you go along.

1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.000
 I'm a drug addict, right?

1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:09.080
 So often my lies aren't planned.

1:15:09.080 --> 1:15:10.000
 They're in the moment.

1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:11.160
 A lot of what I do on the podcast,

1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:12.320
 a lot, you know, it's all in the moment.

1:15:12.320 --> 1:15:13.520
 I'll have an idea what I wanna talk about,

1:15:13.520 --> 1:15:14.760
 and I rant and I go.

1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:16.400
 And I've been like stoned,

1:15:16.400 --> 1:15:17.480
 and I show up at home,

1:15:17.480 --> 1:15:18.560
 and my parents are like,

1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:19.680
 what's going on?

1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:21.080
 There was $50 on the mantle.

1:15:21.080 --> 1:15:22.480
 Now it's not there.

1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:23.400
 And I'm like,

1:15:23.400 --> 1:15:28.400
 well, and I gotta make something up on the spot, right?

1:15:28.640 --> 1:15:31.000
 I've been, you know, are you drinking again?

1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.280
 No, I'm not.

1:15:33.280 --> 1:15:34.560
 And then you gotta have a,

1:15:34.560 --> 1:15:35.760
 well, you were gone for two days.

1:15:35.760 --> 1:15:36.720
 No one knows where you were.

1:15:36.720 --> 1:15:37.880
 And somebody said you left your car.

1:15:37.880 --> 1:15:40.040
 Well, I was at, well, this is,

1:15:40.040 --> 1:15:42.480
 I was at a sales conference and I left my car.

1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:43.400
 I flew to Phoenix.

1:15:43.400 --> 1:15:45.040
 Like, I understand what that is.

1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:47.680
 QAnon is an ever evolving conspiracy theory

1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:50.400
 where the events are happening in the past,

1:15:50.400 --> 1:15:51.600
 in the present, and in the future.

1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:52.520
 It's kind of hilarious.

1:15:52.520 --> 1:15:54.320
 Every conspiracy theory is like Kennedy,

1:15:54.320 --> 1:15:55.160
 something like that,

1:15:55.160 --> 1:15:56.240
 that there's a lot of truth in that,

1:15:56.240 --> 1:15:57.280
 or all truth.

1:15:57.280 --> 1:15:58.280
 But at the end of the day,

1:15:58.280 --> 1:16:00.280
 it's like you're looking back from 30,000 feet,

1:16:00.280 --> 1:16:02.360
 analyzing little things that have already happened.

1:16:02.360 --> 1:16:03.200
 QAnon's like,

1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:06.360
 so I think Alex is kind of like got a little tired of

1:16:06.360 --> 1:16:11.040
 the constant evolving nature of that conspiracy theory.

1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:14.040
 So he's not a fan of like the jazz that is QAnon.

1:16:14.040 --> 1:16:14.880
 So they're not,

1:16:14.880 --> 1:16:15.960
 because they're improvising constantly.

1:16:15.960 --> 1:16:16.800
 They're improvising.

1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:17.960
 Alex is like, hey man,

1:16:17.960 --> 1:16:19.320
 I was on board a little bit,

1:16:19.320 --> 1:16:20.240
 but at the end of the day,

1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:21.120
 it's getting a little annoying

1:16:21.120 --> 1:16:22.680
 because it can turn on you.

1:16:22.680 --> 1:16:25.080
 Eventually you become part of the conspiracy.

1:16:25.080 --> 1:16:26.520
 Alex is controlled opposition.

1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:27.800
 That's what they'll say.

1:16:27.800 --> 1:16:29.400
 Eventually you,

1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:31.480
 because QAnon just eats things.

1:16:31.480 --> 1:16:33.320
 So it's a conspiracy that just eats things.

1:16:33.320 --> 1:16:34.160
 The minute you start to say,

1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:35.720
 hey man, maybe that's not,

1:16:35.720 --> 1:16:36.840
 it just eats you and go,

1:16:36.840 --> 1:16:38.200
 well, you're in on it.

1:16:38.200 --> 1:16:39.040
 Everyone's in on it.

1:16:39.040 --> 1:16:40.200
 Everyone's a satanic pedophile.

1:16:40.200 --> 1:16:41.040
 Everybody.

1:16:41.040 --> 1:16:43.640
 Everyone that questions it is eating children.

1:16:43.640 --> 1:16:45.160
 And you go, wait a minute,

1:16:45.160 --> 1:16:46.920
 that seems illogical.

1:16:46.920 --> 1:16:48.280
 But now there's not enough children.

1:16:48.280 --> 1:16:49.600
 Now there's not enough.

1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:52.200
 And I think QAnon's over now, unfortunately,

1:16:53.520 --> 1:16:54.560
 because for these people,

1:16:54.560 --> 1:16:56.000
 but I think fortunately for them,

1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:57.520
 they're gonna have to find a new hobby.

1:16:57.520 --> 1:16:58.440
 But I think it's over now

1:16:58.440 --> 1:17:00.920
 because even the best QAnon people now are starting to go,

1:17:00.920 --> 1:17:03.760
 hey man, this might not be going down the way we thought.

1:17:03.760 --> 1:17:05.400
 But they've literally gone as far as to say

1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:07.880
 that like Biden and Trump switched faces.

1:17:07.880 --> 1:17:10.600
 Trump's actually still the president except Biden.

1:17:10.600 --> 1:17:12.840
 You have to be a real moron now.

1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:16.200
 You gotta be real stupid now.

1:17:16.200 --> 1:17:17.120
 It's at the end.

1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:19.680
 Like it was cool when the Epstein stuff happened,

1:17:19.680 --> 1:17:22.920
 QAnon was like, it was party at Q.

1:17:22.920 --> 1:17:24.760
 And then when the Hunter Biden laptop stuff

1:17:24.760 --> 1:17:26.800
 started to happen, they were like dancing,

1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:28.480
 like it's time.

1:17:28.480 --> 1:17:33.480
 And then Biden wins and they're like, wait, whoa.

1:17:34.720 --> 1:17:36.680
 And it's just like, it's the day after the party.

1:17:36.680 --> 1:17:38.520
 QAnon, if you ever went to a party in high school

1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:40.840
 or college, QAnon right now is the day after the party.

1:17:40.840 --> 1:17:43.560
 You wake up, it's 12 noon.

1:17:43.560 --> 1:17:44.640
 The sun is hitting you in the face.

1:17:44.640 --> 1:17:45.480
 You're hung over.

1:17:45.480 --> 1:17:47.760
 There's a stench of disgusting beer and cigarettes

1:17:47.760 --> 1:17:48.600
 all over the house.

1:17:48.600 --> 1:17:50.840
 You're like, what the fuck happened here?

1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:53.640
 I gotta get out of here and get a bacon, egg and cheese.

1:17:53.640 --> 1:17:55.080
 That's what QAnon is.

1:17:55.080 --> 1:17:57.040
 They gotta sober up, get out of that house,

1:17:57.040 --> 1:17:58.680
 get a bacon, egg and cheese and go, man,

1:17:58.680 --> 1:18:00.840
 we were fucking whacked.

1:18:00.840 --> 1:18:02.120
 We were high, dude.

1:18:02.120 --> 1:18:05.200
 I thought Nancy Pelosi was eating children for four years

1:18:05.200 --> 1:18:08.400
 and that Donald Trump was gonna put her in Guantanamo Bay.

1:18:08.400 --> 1:18:12.080
 Wow, that was, cause I mean, it's interesting.

1:18:12.080 --> 1:18:14.000
 People had to do that after the sixties.

1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:15.960
 They were like, yeah, I just did a bunch of acid

1:18:15.960 --> 1:18:17.400
 and I lived in a ranch in Malibu

1:18:17.400 --> 1:18:19.960
 and fucked everyone I ever saw.

1:18:19.960 --> 1:18:21.520
 And they're like, I thought that was the way

1:18:21.520 --> 1:18:25.000
 the world was gonna go and I followed some shaman guy,

1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:26.680
 some guru who just wanted to fuck me

1:18:26.680 --> 1:18:28.760
 and 10 other people that were living there.

1:18:28.760 --> 1:18:30.520
 And we did that for three years.

1:18:30.520 --> 1:18:32.440
 Apparently we never created the utopia

1:18:32.440 --> 1:18:33.640
 we thought we were gonna have.

1:18:33.640 --> 1:18:37.240
 And now I'm back working here at Allstate Insurance

1:18:37.240 --> 1:18:39.640
 and we have great policies and we'd love you

1:18:39.640 --> 1:18:42.080
 to come in the office so we can break them down for you.

1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:45.760
 It all ends folks, all the love, all the bullshit ends,

1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:47.960
 but it's fun, they have so much fun.

1:18:47.960 --> 1:18:50.800
 QAnon was hard to get mad at because they were,

1:18:50.800 --> 1:18:53.320
 this was all they had.

1:18:53.320 --> 1:18:56.760
 Yeah, and they were quite good at it.

1:18:56.760 --> 1:18:59.720
 And they were good at it and it was a lot

1:18:59.720 --> 1:19:02.800
 of desperate people, but they were also rich idiots.

1:19:02.800 --> 1:19:04.600
 There's also like dumb rich people

1:19:04.600 --> 1:19:08.000
 and those are like the saddest people in Q

1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:09.160
 cause it's like they should,

1:19:09.160 --> 1:19:11.400
 they have the resources to do other things,

1:19:11.400 --> 1:19:13.080
 but they just love Q.

1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:14.880
 They're like, I'm just into this.

1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:18.640
 And I'm like, you're rich, go do something.

1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:20.200
 How in curious are you?

1:19:20.200 --> 1:19:23.080
 Go to the Amazon, go bird walk.

1:19:23.080 --> 1:19:25.000
 I don't know, but they're, you know, so.

1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:25.840
 Play golf.

1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:26.960
 It's sad, but they're like done now.

1:19:26.960 --> 1:19:29.120
 I mean, it's over.

1:19:29.120 --> 1:19:31.040
 I see you think this is the.

1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:31.920
 I think everything's ending.

1:19:31.920 --> 1:19:34.720
 My whole thing is that Trump's out, QAnon's over,

1:19:34.720 --> 1:19:35.920
 the quarantine is gonna end.

1:19:35.920 --> 1:19:37.760
 Everything's gonna go back

1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:40.560
 to something that's more recognizable.

1:19:40.560 --> 1:19:42.200
 I think that.

1:19:42.200 --> 1:19:44.840
 Are you optimistic about the 2021 and what.

1:19:44.840 --> 1:19:48.600
 To a degree in certain aspects, I have optimism.

1:19:48.600 --> 1:19:50.920
 And then I have, I have short term optimism

1:19:50.920 --> 1:19:52.720
 and longterm pessimism.

1:19:52.720 --> 1:19:54.200
 Meaning that I think in the short term,

1:19:54.200 --> 1:19:55.240
 things can get better.

1:19:55.240 --> 1:19:57.440
 I think longterm, because there's so many forces

1:19:57.440 --> 1:19:59.280
 that are out of our control that are evolving

1:19:59.280 --> 1:20:02.880
 in ways I barely understand that are carving up society.

1:20:02.880 --> 1:20:04.760
 It's gonna be very tough longterm

1:20:04.760 --> 1:20:07.080
 to be completely optimistic.

1:20:07.080 --> 1:20:08.040
 Like, Hey, it's gonna be great.

1:20:08.040 --> 1:20:09.400
 It's gonna be good forever.

1:20:09.400 --> 1:20:12.000
 But short term, I think, yeah, this quarantine will end.

1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:12.840
 Things will get better.

1:20:12.840 --> 1:20:14.600
 The economy will get a little better.

1:20:14.600 --> 1:20:18.600
 The constant Trump craziness will die down a little bit.

1:20:18.600 --> 1:20:19.480
 That's my hope.

1:20:19.480 --> 1:20:22.200
 And people can go back to focusing on things that matter,

1:20:22.200 --> 1:20:26.040
 which is the things that are near you and close to you.

1:20:26.040 --> 1:20:27.280
 Yeah, the humans around you.

1:20:27.280 --> 1:20:30.480
 Humans around you, not Nancy Pelosi.

1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:32.280
 I have uncles that talk about Nancy Pelosi.

1:20:32.280 --> 1:20:33.840
 I'm like, you've never met her.

1:20:33.840 --> 1:20:36.400
 You'll never meet her, shut up.

1:20:36.400 --> 1:20:40.960
 And I have a belief that this kind of local love

1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:42.960
 and kindness that you naturally can have

1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:45.320
 for human beings that you actually know

1:20:45.320 --> 1:20:49.320
 can be expanded at scale through the social networks

1:20:49.320 --> 1:20:52.120
 that we use, that we build.

1:20:52.120 --> 1:20:54.560
 Twitter is currently failing at that miserably.

1:20:54.560 --> 1:20:55.400
 That would be great.

1:20:55.400 --> 1:20:56.240
 But that's...

1:20:56.240 --> 1:20:58.720
 If we were able to increase the love

1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:00.920
 through the social networks, that would be great.

1:21:00.920 --> 1:21:02.560
 It feels very hard to.

1:21:03.440 --> 1:21:04.880
 It's a worthy challenge.

1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:08.120
 You've tweeted, one of the underreported reasons

1:21:08.120 --> 1:21:10.080
 conspiracy theories take hold

1:21:10.080 --> 1:21:11.760
 is because some of them are true.

1:21:13.120 --> 1:21:17.400
 What conspiracy theories do you believe

1:21:17.400 --> 1:21:22.400
 that are sort of important for people to think about,

1:21:22.560 --> 1:21:23.400
 would you say?

1:21:24.560 --> 1:21:27.280
 Kennedy was not killed by a lone gunman

1:21:27.280 --> 1:21:31.200
 with no connections to any other situation, government.

1:21:31.200 --> 1:21:34.720
 I believe that JFK was removed from office

1:21:34.720 --> 1:21:39.720
 by a group of people that had very different interests.

1:21:40.520 --> 1:21:41.360
 But...

1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:42.200
 This is the question of like deep state.

1:21:42.200 --> 1:21:45.080
 So these are powerful people that are able now

1:21:45.080 --> 1:21:49.680
 to dictate through basically the threat of violence

1:21:49.680 --> 1:21:51.760
 what the presidents,

1:21:51.760 --> 1:21:53.560
 the surface powerful people in our society.

1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:55.360
 Yeah, I mean, again, I'm not...

1:21:55.360 --> 1:21:58.160
 I want another investigation into 9 11,

1:21:58.160 --> 1:22:00.360
 not because I think that George Bush pressed a button

1:22:00.360 --> 1:22:01.400
 and made 9 11 happen,

1:22:01.400 --> 1:22:03.680
 but because we invaded the country of Iraq.

1:22:03.680 --> 1:22:08.680
 And then we, 15 out of 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia.

1:22:09.120 --> 1:22:10.840
 There was tons of stuff in the 9 11 report

1:22:10.840 --> 1:22:12.880
 that didn't make sense to anybody.

1:22:12.880 --> 1:22:14.600
 There's tons of stuff about that day

1:22:14.600 --> 1:22:16.360
 that I feel like we just don't know.

1:22:16.360 --> 1:22:17.200
 Yeah, that's...

1:22:17.200 --> 1:22:18.400
 Sorry to interrupt.

1:22:18.400 --> 1:22:21.920
 That's when I, my little aunt life

1:22:21.920 --> 1:22:23.920
 touched upon conspiracy theory world

1:22:23.920 --> 1:22:27.800
 and first learned about Alex Jones is when 9 11 happened.

1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:30.400
 It was very frustrating to me

1:22:30.400 --> 1:22:33.000
 how poorly the reporting and the transparency

1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:35.960
 around what exactly happened, who knew what,

1:22:35.960 --> 1:22:37.480
 all that kind of a basic information

1:22:37.480 --> 1:22:42.360
 that you would hope the government would release, reveal,

1:22:42.360 --> 1:22:45.920
 and use as like a lesson for how we prevent this.

1:22:45.920 --> 1:22:48.920
 Instead, it felt like a lot of stuff was being hidden

1:22:48.920 --> 1:22:51.480
 in order to manipulate some kind of machine

1:22:51.480 --> 1:22:52.800
 that leads us to war.

1:22:52.800 --> 1:22:54.760
 Yeah, that's fair to say.

1:22:54.760 --> 1:22:56.240
 Yeah, I mean, I just don't feel like

1:22:56.240 --> 1:22:57.360
 we've gotten the full story.

1:22:57.360 --> 1:22:58.520
 I don't know what the full story is.

1:22:58.520 --> 1:23:00.320
 I can't, I don't know what it is,

1:23:00.320 --> 1:23:02.920
 but I don't feel like we've gotten the full story.

1:23:02.920 --> 1:23:06.280
 Yeah, there are groups of powerful pedophiles, right?

1:23:06.280 --> 1:23:07.440
 Whether they're in the Catholic church

1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:08.960
 or they're in the government or wherever they are,

1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:11.160
 they are able to cover things up that they do.

1:23:11.160 --> 1:23:13.480
 They're able to silence people that try to out them

1:23:13.480 --> 1:23:16.080
 in terms of like, you know, disrupt their operations.

1:23:16.080 --> 1:23:16.920
 That's true.

1:23:16.920 --> 1:23:18.600
 QAnon has nuggets of truth.

1:23:18.600 --> 1:23:20.120
 It just went crazy.

1:23:20.120 --> 1:23:23.160
 Any conspiracy theory that involves the Knights Templar

1:23:23.160 --> 1:23:27.680
 and also Chrissy Teigen is probably wrong, you know?

1:23:27.680 --> 1:23:28.840
 What's the Knights Templar?

1:23:28.840 --> 1:23:32.000
 Well, it was just this group of Knights back in the day.

1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:34.680
 You know, it's that supposedly secret meetings.

1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:36.760
 And like in every conspiracy, they talk about like,

1:23:36.760 --> 1:23:37.800
 you know, if you go deep enough,

1:23:37.800 --> 1:23:40.800
 it's like the Knights Templar, the Rosicrucians,

1:23:40.800 --> 1:23:43.800
 you know, all of these secret groups throughout history,

1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:45.120
 the Illuminati, the...

1:23:45.120 --> 1:23:46.720
 Oh, and there's a thread that connects all of this.

1:23:46.720 --> 1:23:49.000
 Oh yes, it connects it all to David Spade.

1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:50.520
 I mean, it's a little much.

1:23:50.520 --> 1:23:52.000
 Well, how do you, if you're David Spade,

1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:53.200
 defend yourself, by the way?

1:23:53.200 --> 1:23:54.760
 You ignore it because it's hilarious.

1:23:54.760 --> 1:23:55.680
 And I know David Spade.

1:23:55.680 --> 1:23:57.480
 It's like Hollywood's kind of boring.

1:23:57.480 --> 1:23:58.840
 Yes, there are sex orgies.

1:23:58.840 --> 1:23:59.680
 I'm not invited.

1:23:59.680 --> 1:24:00.920
 I'm sure there's shit going on.

1:24:00.920 --> 1:24:02.800
 Kids do get abused, women get abused.

1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:03.880
 I'll invite you to one.

1:24:03.880 --> 1:24:08.480
 Please, we got the $75,000 dog and then we'll get one.

1:24:08.480 --> 1:24:10.920
 But, you know, me and David Spade,

1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:12.960
 we go out to sushi restaurants, like,

1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:15.320
 and you sit there and you listen to people complain.

1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:16.920
 That's what a lot of it is.

1:24:16.920 --> 1:24:20.160
 What a lot of Hollywood is is deeply sad tragedy

1:24:20.160 --> 1:24:23.560
 that people don't understand that some of it is nefarious

1:24:23.560 --> 1:24:24.960
 and dark and there are problems

1:24:24.960 --> 1:24:26.720
 and there are real power brokers here.

1:24:26.720 --> 1:24:29.200
 It's a dark town, 100%.

1:24:29.200 --> 1:24:31.120
 But the idea that everybody that lives here

1:24:31.120 --> 1:24:34.680
 is in some wide ranging vast conspiracy isn't true.

1:24:34.680 --> 1:24:39.520
 It ignores how humdrum, boring, deeply sad

1:24:39.520 --> 1:24:41.440
 most people's lives are in Hollywood.

1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:44.320
 And it ignores how sad fame is in general.

1:24:44.320 --> 1:24:46.000
 Fame's a sad thing.

1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:49.240
 Not always, but a lot of times it's a sad thing.

1:24:49.240 --> 1:24:52.280
 It's fleeting, it's ephemeral, it doesn't last.

1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:55.480
 It separates you from other people.

1:24:55.480 --> 1:24:57.360
 It's isolating.

1:24:57.360 --> 1:24:59.800
 It can be traumatic depending on what's going on.

1:24:59.800 --> 1:25:01.640
 Obviously it's better than the alternative.

1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:03.000
 If you're trying to be famous,

1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:05.360
 it's better to be famous than not famous, right?

1:25:05.360 --> 1:25:06.560
 I'll say that.

1:25:06.560 --> 1:25:09.240
 But it's a mixed bag to a degree.

1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:11.440
 There are things about it that aren't great.

1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:14.040
 And Hollywood has a deep undercurrent of sadness

1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:16.200
 of people that have not realized their dreams

1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:18.640
 and people that have realized them.

1:25:18.640 --> 1:25:21.240
 Both of those people.

1:25:21.240 --> 1:25:23.000
 The people that win Olympic gold medals

1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:24.760
 can sometimes suffer from depression.

1:25:24.760 --> 1:25:25.600
 Correct.

1:25:25.600 --> 1:25:26.420
 They've lost.

1:25:26.420 --> 1:25:28.040
 Well, somebody said, and I forget who said it,

1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:29.680
 it's a great quote, it's not mine.

1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:31.960
 I think it's from a book, or it might be from a TV show.

1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:33.360
 Sometimes I quote something and they're like,

1:25:33.360 --> 1:25:35.000
 "'That's from like, Charlotte's Web."

1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:36.600
 I'm like, oh.

1:25:36.600 --> 1:25:37.420
 The two worst things are,

1:25:37.420 --> 1:25:39.280
 oh, I think it's from the movie Limitless.

1:25:39.280 --> 1:25:40.240
 I'm like an idiot.

1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:42.620
 But anyway, thanks for having me on.

1:25:42.620 --> 1:25:43.460
 Tomorrow you're gonna make some genius.

1:25:43.460 --> 1:25:45.280
 I will not publish this.

1:25:46.600 --> 1:25:48.480
 It's from the movie, and I think he says,

1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:50.520
 "'The two worst things in the world are not good."

1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:52.440
 Oh, you know what's not from Limitless?

1:25:52.440 --> 1:25:55.880
 I think it's from the movie

1:25:55.880 --> 1:25:58.000
 where Nicolas Cage sold weapons.

1:25:58.000 --> 1:25:59.280
 It was called Lord of War.

1:25:59.280 --> 1:26:00.480
 It's a little better than Limitless.

1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:01.600
 Anyway. That's a good movie.

1:26:01.600 --> 1:26:02.440
 It's a great movie.

1:26:02.440 --> 1:26:03.960
 He said, the two worst things in the world

1:26:03.960 --> 1:26:06.360
 are not getting what you want and getting it.

1:26:06.360 --> 1:26:07.600
 So the undercurrents of sadness

1:26:07.600 --> 1:26:09.000
 that run through Hollywood are,

1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:10.720
 there are two rivers that converge,

1:26:10.720 --> 1:26:12.520
 and there are people that just never had it,

1:26:12.520 --> 1:26:14.520
 and people that have it and go, now what?

1:26:14.520 --> 1:26:16.040
 And so it's a sad place, a tragic place.

1:26:16.040 --> 1:26:17.840
 And there's a lot of, it's boring.

1:26:17.840 --> 1:26:19.440
 That's what people don't realize is like,

1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:20.840
 it's actually kind of boring.

1:26:20.840 --> 1:26:21.960
 Well, life is kind of boring.

1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:22.960
 Life is kind of boring.

1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:24.440
 But there's also like, you know,

1:26:24.440 --> 1:26:26.840
 so I think QAnon's this way to make a lot of it seem like

1:26:26.840 --> 1:26:28.440
 it's super exciting.

1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:30.680
 And listen, I don't want to diminish the experiences

1:26:30.680 --> 1:26:31.520
 of people who've been abused here,

1:26:31.520 --> 1:26:33.240
 because there is a lot of horror here.

1:26:33.240 --> 1:26:34.680
 But the whole QAnon thing was like,

1:26:34.680 --> 1:26:38.000
 everybody in everything is doing, and that's not true.

1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:41.640
 Well, see, just to linger on that a little bit is,

1:26:41.640 --> 1:26:45.040
 Bill Gates, the conspiracy theories around Bill Gates

1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:50.040
 bother me because, this is me, dumb, naive Lex,

1:26:50.920 --> 1:26:53.680
 thinks that Bill Gates did a lot of good for this world.

1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:54.520
 Sure.

1:26:54.520 --> 1:26:56.560
 First, by creating a company

1:26:56.560 --> 1:26:58.840
 that empowered personal computers.

1:26:58.840 --> 1:27:01.480
 And second, by donating a ton of money

1:27:01.480 --> 1:27:04.600
 for like treating malaria in Africa

1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:06.320
 and all those kinds of things.

1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:10.160
 And there's these huge amounts of conspiracies, I think,

1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:12.480
 based on like just replies to whenever

1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:15.480
 Bill Gates does anything.

1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:19.000
 Like, to me, the top replies should be about

1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:22.520
 how inspiring that guy is, to donate so much money.

1:27:22.520 --> 1:27:27.520
 And so sorry to, the thing I'm struggling with is,

1:27:27.640 --> 1:27:32.080
 if I'm Bill Gates, like, how do you behave differently?

1:27:32.080 --> 1:27:34.800
 How do you show people that you're, if you're not,

1:27:34.800 --> 1:27:36.640
 I don't know, doing creepy stuff

1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:38.200
 that they're saying he's doing?

1:27:38.200 --> 1:27:39.920
 Well, I think part of it is that

1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:42.320
 he's done some really good stuff, right?

1:27:42.320 --> 1:27:43.960
 He's an innovative guy, he's on the vanguard

1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:47.200
 of a lot of things, but he's also the antichrist.

1:27:47.200 --> 1:27:49.360
 And I think that that is, you know,

1:27:49.360 --> 1:27:51.400
 they're not mutually exclusive.

1:27:51.400 --> 1:27:54.920
 He is the prince of darkness, as well as some, no.

1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:55.960
 Here's my deal with Bill Gates.

1:27:55.960 --> 1:27:57.320
 He's a Batman villain billionaire,

1:27:57.320 --> 1:27:58.440
 meaning that he's not a villain,

1:27:58.440 --> 1:27:59.760
 but he's got all this money, right?

1:27:59.760 --> 1:28:01.320
 Here's the thing, and I love Musk and all these guys,

1:28:01.320 --> 1:28:02.480
 I know you love these guys.

1:28:02.480 --> 1:28:04.640
 Listen, when you have the kind of money that these guys have

1:28:04.640 --> 1:28:06.280
 and you have the vision that they have,

1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:08.240
 and they want society to look a certain way,

1:28:08.240 --> 1:28:10.120
 and a lot of them are doing great things,

1:28:10.120 --> 1:28:13.000
 people, they need to get better at the pushback.

1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:14.200
 They need to get a little better.

1:28:14.200 --> 1:28:16.880
 When somebody says, hey man, what's going on over there?

1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:18.600
 Bill Gates needs to be a little better at going,

1:28:18.600 --> 1:28:23.600
 here's what, because, you know, Bill Gates has the money.

1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:26.280
 You know, I think once he wanted to shoot a missile

1:28:26.280 --> 1:28:28.640
 of dust at the atmosphere to help global warming,

1:28:28.640 --> 1:28:29.640
 and a lot of scientists were like,

1:28:29.640 --> 1:28:31.240
 hey man, that might not be the way to do it.

1:28:31.240 --> 1:28:33.280
 But no one in history, like so few people in history

1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:35.560
 have had the resources to even have that thought,

1:28:35.560 --> 1:28:37.080
 that if you have the resources to have that thought,

1:28:37.080 --> 1:28:39.120
 and you have designs on the way you want society to look,

1:28:39.120 --> 1:28:41.760
 whether it's public health policy or vaccinations,

1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:44.440
 whatever, you have to get a little better

1:28:44.440 --> 1:28:46.680
 at dealing with legitimate critiques.

1:28:46.680 --> 1:28:48.200
 And obviously you're not defending yourself

1:28:48.200 --> 1:28:49.720
 against people that say you're the Antichrist,

1:28:49.720 --> 1:28:51.680
 but like, you need to get a little better.

1:28:51.680 --> 1:28:53.800
 And I feel like Bill Gates and some of those people

1:28:53.800 --> 1:28:57.800
 at that level are like, ugh, PR is kind of like, you know.

1:28:57.800 --> 1:28:58.640
 They're terrible at it.

1:28:58.640 --> 1:28:59.480
 They're terrible at it.

1:28:59.480 --> 1:29:00.320
 They're terrible at it.

1:29:00.320 --> 1:29:01.520
 Him and Zuckerberg are really bad at it.

1:29:01.520 --> 1:29:02.680
 Zuckerberg's horrible at it.

1:29:02.680 --> 1:29:07.160
 He seems especially bad at public.

1:29:08.160 --> 1:29:10.000
 Yeah, and it makes me feel so bad

1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:13.200
 because the problem with being a billionaire

1:29:13.200 --> 1:29:16.520
 is you lose touch with reality if you're not careful.

1:29:16.520 --> 1:29:20.400
 I think Elon is good at, at least so far,

1:29:20.400 --> 1:29:22.240
 maintaining touch with reality.

1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:24.320
 No, if you look at the name of his child,

1:29:24.320 --> 1:29:25.720
 you can clearly see.

1:29:25.720 --> 1:29:27.160
 Listen, I do like him,

1:29:27.160 --> 1:29:29.000
 and I do think what he's done with Tesla,

1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:30.360
 you know, my producer has a Tesla,

1:29:30.360 --> 1:29:31.640
 and he never shuts up about it.

1:29:31.640 --> 1:29:34.120
 Most people that have Teslas never shut up about them,

1:29:34.120 --> 1:29:36.480
 and they think they're part of the development team

1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:39.880
 at SpaceX, and I like that he's created a world

1:29:39.880 --> 1:29:43.160
 where people can get excited about a $37,000 car

1:29:43.160 --> 1:29:44.920
 and never shut the fuck up about it

1:29:44.920 --> 1:29:46.560
 to the point where I have to threaten people

1:29:46.560 --> 1:29:49.200
 with physical violence to get them to stop telling me

1:29:49.200 --> 1:29:50.840
 about that their car drives itself.

1:29:50.840 --> 1:29:51.680
 Oh, you should get a Tesla.

1:29:51.680 --> 1:29:54.760
 Maybe have a few less drinks and a few fewer Vicodin,

1:29:54.760 --> 1:29:55.920
 and you can drive yourself.

1:29:55.920 --> 1:29:57.040
 Have you thought about getting a Tesla?

1:29:57.040 --> 1:29:57.880
 I've never thought about it.

1:29:57.880 --> 1:29:58.720
 You should get a Tesla.

1:29:58.720 --> 1:29:59.640
 I don't like them, they're minimalist.

1:29:59.640 --> 1:30:02.080
 I don't like, I want more.

1:30:02.080 --> 1:30:03.120
 I want more.

1:30:03.120 --> 1:30:04.040
 Get the Cybertruck.

1:30:04.040 --> 1:30:04.880
 I want a Cybertruck.

1:30:04.880 --> 1:30:07.680
 I'm just being a, trolling you by being a salesman.

1:30:07.680 --> 1:30:09.120
 My producer wants a Cybertruck.

1:30:09.120 --> 1:30:10.760
 I want a stagecoach.

1:30:10.760 --> 1:30:15.120
 Old school, stagecoach, horse thief shit.

1:30:15.120 --> 1:30:16.920
 It's going back to that.

1:30:16.920 --> 1:30:18.240
 I live in an area with a lot of horses.

1:30:18.240 --> 1:30:20.520
 It's going back to like whipping a horse.

1:30:20.520 --> 1:30:22.920
 I want an animal to shriek while I go by.

1:30:22.920 --> 1:30:27.640
 You want more suffering in the world, not less.

1:30:27.640 --> 1:30:28.840
 Oh, I think we need it.

1:30:28.840 --> 1:30:33.440
 Okay, but I just don't like that billionaire is a bad word.

1:30:33.440 --> 1:30:35.080
 And it's not necessarily,

1:30:35.080 --> 1:30:37.120
 not every billionaire is a pedophile.

1:30:37.120 --> 1:30:39.840
 I know, but the problem is a lot of like,

1:30:39.840 --> 1:30:41.760
 it's just, you know, Epstein was very smart

1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:43.240
 at like just getting people at that house

1:30:43.240 --> 1:30:44.960
 and taking photos of them.

1:30:44.960 --> 1:30:46.000
 Nobody knew what they were doing,

1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:47.840
 but it's like, it was one of those things where it's like,

1:30:47.840 --> 1:30:49.240
 Epstein was the most social guy ever.

1:30:49.240 --> 1:30:51.560
 Like every photo he's like, hey,

1:30:51.560 --> 1:30:54.720
 and it's like everyone that's ever done anything

1:30:54.720 --> 1:30:57.120
 in the world has been at that fucking island.

1:30:57.120 --> 1:30:59.480
 Every human being is like in a photo.

1:30:59.480 --> 1:31:00.640
 It's just weird, like I'm in,

1:31:00.640 --> 1:31:02.200
 like it's funny me and my friends get together.

1:31:02.200 --> 1:31:04.080
 We don't ever take photos, right?

1:31:04.080 --> 1:31:05.520
 Like last night, a few people,

1:31:05.520 --> 1:31:07.840
 it was my birthday yesterday, I'm 17.

1:31:07.840 --> 1:31:11.640
 And my friends came over and we're just eating dinner, right?

1:31:11.640 --> 1:31:12.480
 And we had a fun night,

1:31:12.480 --> 1:31:14.600
 and just four people that are over, nobody, right?

1:31:14.600 --> 1:31:18.040
 Nobody ever thought like, let's, hey, I wanna remember it.

1:31:18.040 --> 1:31:21.920
 Let's take photos, I'm 36, woo!

1:31:21.920 --> 1:31:23.480
 But everything Epstein did,

1:31:23.480 --> 1:31:26.480
 there's just photos of everybody, it's interesting.

1:31:26.480 --> 1:31:29.240
 Do you think Jeffrey Epstein killed himself?

1:31:29.240 --> 1:31:32.360
 No, I think he was killed by that guy,

1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:37.000
 that guy that they put in his cell, that lunatic,

1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:38.120
 who was that big muscled guy.

1:31:38.120 --> 1:31:40.280
 I think he was just, he did it for money,

1:31:40.280 --> 1:31:41.280
 kept his mouth shut.

1:31:41.280 --> 1:31:42.120
 That's it.

1:31:42.120 --> 1:31:43.560
 Money from whom do you think?

1:31:43.560 --> 1:31:47.200
 Mossad, MI6, CIA, all three.

1:31:47.200 --> 1:31:48.280
 So there's a lot of pressure

1:31:48.280 --> 1:31:49.920
 from a lot of different powerful people.

1:31:49.920 --> 1:31:51.800
 Probably Mossad, CIA more.

1:31:52.880 --> 1:31:55.240
 I mean, it seems very clear that he was working

1:31:55.240 --> 1:31:57.800
 inside of a honeypot intelligence operation.

1:31:57.800 --> 1:32:01.120
 Ghislaine Maxwell's father was an Israeli super spy.

1:32:01.120 --> 1:32:03.440
 Ghislaine Maxwell's working for Israeli intelligence.

1:32:03.440 --> 1:32:04.640
 It would be odd to think,

1:32:04.640 --> 1:32:06.360
 and of course the CIA knows about everything

1:32:06.360 --> 1:32:08.920
 that Israeli intelligence is doing with Americans.

1:32:08.920 --> 1:32:12.000
 So I would think that it's a very cozy relationship

1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:13.880
 with those two intelligence agencies.

1:32:13.880 --> 1:32:15.800
 And I think if you ran it by anyone,

1:32:15.800 --> 1:32:17.200
 I think if you ran it by French intelligence,

1:32:17.200 --> 1:32:19.560
 they'd go, yeah, no, get him.

1:32:19.560 --> 1:32:21.080
 I don't think there was any intelligence service

1:32:21.080 --> 1:32:23.560
 in the world whose job is to protect the powerful people

1:32:23.560 --> 1:32:24.520
 that live in their countries

1:32:24.520 --> 1:32:27.040
 that was against him getting whacked.

1:32:27.040 --> 1:32:30.000
 But do you think it's possible that he's just an evil person

1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:33.840
 who is after manipulating people and also was a pedophile?

1:32:33.840 --> 1:32:36.400
 So that there's a bigger thing.

1:32:36.400 --> 1:32:37.880
 It's not factual that there's a bigger thing.

1:32:37.880 --> 1:32:39.120
 Evil people don't get handed.

1:32:39.120 --> 1:32:40.800
 Those are your facts, Tim Dillon.

1:32:40.800 --> 1:32:42.600
 No, there's the facts of the case.

1:32:42.600 --> 1:32:44.280
 You don't get handed a 65.

1:32:44.280 --> 1:32:45.560
 Show me another evil guy

1:32:45.560 --> 1:32:50.440
 who was handed a $65 million place by Les Wexner.

1:32:50.440 --> 1:32:51.960
 Show me another evil guy

1:32:51.960 --> 1:32:55.120
 that got that type of a handshake deal

1:32:55.120 --> 1:32:58.480
 where he was basically let off without anything

1:32:58.480 --> 1:33:02.920
 after a judge had made a very sweetheart deal for him

1:33:02.920 --> 1:33:06.240
 after he was accused of molesting a 14 year old.

1:33:06.240 --> 1:33:07.680
 Show me another evil guy

1:33:07.680 --> 1:33:10.200
 that doesn't have that kind of backing

1:33:10.200 --> 1:33:12.360
 that has those types of friends, those connections,

1:33:12.360 --> 1:33:13.640
 those types of properties.

1:33:13.640 --> 1:33:16.880
 Show me multiple passports all over the world.

1:33:16.880 --> 1:33:20.400
 So show me a guy without anyone backing him that's doing it.

1:33:20.400 --> 1:33:23.160
 Why did they, so you think he's just an evil guy

1:33:23.160 --> 1:33:26.960
 who is doing this for whom is his own just shits and giggles.

1:33:26.960 --> 1:33:28.320
 He's just getting off on it.

1:33:28.320 --> 1:33:29.280
 Human nature, yeah.

1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:30.360
 Human nature, huh?

1:33:30.360 --> 1:33:31.320
 It's human nature.

1:33:31.320 --> 1:33:33.360
 $70 million limestone mansion.

1:33:33.360 --> 1:33:34.760
 I'm being visibly mocked.

1:33:34.760 --> 1:33:36.240
 Yeah, is it human nature?

1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:37.600
 And it's like poetry.

1:33:37.600 --> 1:33:38.840
 I don't think it's human nature.

1:33:38.840 --> 1:33:41.800
 I think they manipulated human nature,

1:33:41.800 --> 1:33:43.520
 but I think they did it.

1:33:43.520 --> 1:33:44.360
 I think JustLane,

1:33:44.360 --> 1:33:46.360
 I think Epstein was really just a functionary

1:33:46.360 --> 1:33:48.840
 and I think JustLane was kind of a pimp

1:33:48.840 --> 1:33:52.080
 and Epstein was kind of a guy that made the money okay

1:33:52.080 --> 1:33:54.280
 and hid money and things like that

1:33:54.280 --> 1:33:56.160
 and worked for a lot of powerful people.

1:33:56.160 --> 1:34:00.040
 I don't believe in lone pedophiles anymore.

1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:01.040
 I don't even believe that.

1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:03.880
 If you're a pedophile, you're like in a group.

1:34:03.880 --> 1:34:05.080
 You know what I mean?

1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:09.440
 Well, I'm not even going there,

1:34:09.440 --> 1:34:11.160
 but staying on JustLane,

1:34:11.160 --> 1:34:13.040
 so you believe there's some power in her.

1:34:13.040 --> 1:34:15.360
 What do you think happens to her now?

1:34:15.360 --> 1:34:16.640
 Like what are the differences?

1:34:16.640 --> 1:34:17.480
 Great question.

1:34:17.480 --> 1:34:19.880
 I mean, I don't know what'll happen to her,

1:34:19.880 --> 1:34:22.880
 but I imagine she'll get some type of deal,

1:34:22.880 --> 1:34:24.920
 closed door thing years from now

1:34:24.920 --> 1:34:26.840
 when people don't really care about the case

1:34:26.840 --> 1:34:30.360
 and she'll serve some time in a very lax thing

1:34:30.360 --> 1:34:31.280
 or she'll be killed.

1:34:31.280 --> 1:34:33.720
 I mean, again, it's like if she was doing

1:34:33.720 --> 1:34:36.160
 what she was doing, which is I believe a fact

1:34:36.160 --> 1:34:38.600
 that she was compromising powerful people

1:34:38.600 --> 1:34:40.200
 so that they could be blackmailed

1:34:40.200 --> 1:34:45.200
 by the intelligence services of the US and Israel,

1:34:47.280 --> 1:34:51.080
 probably, I don't see how she wasn't doing that.

1:34:51.080 --> 1:34:53.880
 Someone's black, someone's using the photos

1:34:53.880 --> 1:34:55.000
 and the tapes, right?

1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:57.640
 Someone's using that against these people.

1:34:57.640 --> 1:34:59.280
 Someone wants to control these people.

1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:00.680
 Well, who and why?

1:35:00.680 --> 1:35:02.000
 That's the real question.

1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:05.560
 And I think the real question is you wanna exert control

1:35:05.560 --> 1:35:09.080
 over congressmen and senators and presidents

1:35:09.080 --> 1:35:11.920
 because they have the power to make decisions

1:35:11.920 --> 1:35:13.720
 to affect the, but the CIA just works

1:35:13.720 --> 1:35:15.920
 for a lot of very wealthy people.

1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:18.600
 That's what the CIA, so how the CIA started, right?

1:35:18.600 --> 1:35:19.880
 It was lawyers, bankers.

1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:22.160
 They're protecting financial interests

1:35:22.160 --> 1:35:25.080
 of multinational corporations all over the world,

1:35:25.080 --> 1:35:27.560
 overthrowing democratically elected governments,

1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:29.400
 going in and doing subterfuge campaigns,

1:35:29.400 --> 1:35:30.240
 encouraging terror.

1:35:30.240 --> 1:35:31.840
 They were doing all kinds of crazy stuff.

1:35:31.840 --> 1:35:33.280
 I don't see why that would change.

1:35:33.280 --> 1:35:34.840
 I think that's who they still represent.

1:35:34.840 --> 1:35:38.440
 And I think those people want certain policies

1:35:38.440 --> 1:35:40.080
 and certain people pushed forward.

1:35:40.080 --> 1:35:42.080
 And I think those people are controlled.

1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:44.040
 And I think one of the ways to control people

1:35:44.040 --> 1:35:46.480
 is their sexual problems.

1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:48.120
 And that's the way they did it.

1:35:49.440 --> 1:35:51.800
 I wish there was a way to,

1:35:51.800 --> 1:35:54.440
 because everything you just said now is.

1:35:54.440 --> 1:35:56.320
 It makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?

1:35:56.320 --> 1:35:59.840
 I'm being indoctrinated on air.

1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:00.680
 No.

1:36:00.680 --> 1:36:01.520
 You think there's just a,

1:36:01.520 --> 1:36:03.560
 Jeff Ramsey is just a fun, random guy

1:36:03.560 --> 1:36:06.520
 who just wanted to make home movies of presidents?

1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:09.720
 Well, you think I'm just some random guy.

1:36:09.720 --> 1:36:11.880
 I'm just trying to sell myself as somebody

1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:14.240
 who's friendly with the American audience.

1:36:14.240 --> 1:36:16.440
 I believe you are backed by people

1:36:16.440 --> 1:36:19.520
 that want people to be more comfortable with robot dogs.

1:36:20.520 --> 1:36:21.360
 I believe that.

1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:23.760
 I believe you're pushed to be the happy face of AI.

1:36:23.760 --> 1:36:24.600
 Which is why I will edit this part.

1:36:24.600 --> 1:36:26.160
 They shouldn't pick the happier face.

1:36:26.160 --> 1:36:27.000
 Wow.

1:36:28.120 --> 1:36:28.960
 No editing.

1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:30.800
 Joe Rogan's rule, no editing.

1:36:30.800 --> 1:36:31.880
 This is live.

1:36:31.880 --> 1:36:33.760
 No, I mean, I wish there was a way to,

1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:35.280
 for some of the conspiracy theories,

1:36:35.280 --> 1:36:37.160
 to prove that that's not the case.

1:36:37.160 --> 1:36:39.800
 Like what the CIA is.

1:36:39.800 --> 1:36:42.600
 There is some possibility in my mind

1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:45.360
 that institutions like the CIA

1:36:45.360 --> 1:36:47.720
 and different kinds of organizations

1:36:47.720 --> 1:36:52.720
 are driven less by organized malevolence

1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:54.840
 and more by just incompetence.

1:36:54.840 --> 1:36:56.760
 Just bureaucracy, being incompetent.

1:36:56.760 --> 1:37:00.480
 I think that argument gets less and less persuasive

1:37:00.480 --> 1:37:03.120
 when you look at all the things they've been able to do.

1:37:03.120 --> 1:37:06.120
 It's very certain, just like you said,

1:37:06.120 --> 1:37:08.520
 that there's a bunch of them that have done,

1:37:08.520 --> 1:37:11.080
 because there's some conspiracy theories

1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:14.080
 that are dramatic and true.

1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:17.480
 The question is, I wish there was a way to prove

1:37:17.480 --> 1:37:19.120
 that some of them are not.

1:37:19.120 --> 1:37:20.200
 And it's very difficult,

1:37:20.200 --> 1:37:22.560
 because so much is shrouded in mystery.

1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:24.440
 Like one of the things I'm bothered by

1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:26.760
 is when people accuse other athletes

1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:28.760
 of using steroids, for example.

1:37:28.760 --> 1:37:31.040
 And it's just, yes, a lot of people use steroids,

1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:34.600
 but it sucks that people just don't believe you.

1:37:35.560 --> 1:37:37.840
 There's some incredible athletes that look shredded,

1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:40.400
 that look just incredible performers,

1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:43.920
 and everybody just says that they're on steroids.

1:37:43.920 --> 1:37:44.760
 They kind of assume.

1:37:44.760 --> 1:37:47.960
 Yeah, I mean, and people accuse me all the time

1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:50.420
 of being on performance enhancing drugs and steroids.

1:37:50.420 --> 1:37:53.320
 And it is hard, but what I remind them is,

1:37:53.320 --> 1:37:58.320
 it's what my appearance is a result of dedication.

1:37:58.880 --> 1:38:02.120
 But no, it's hard work, diet, exercise, dedication.

1:38:02.120 --> 1:38:03.040
 Are you on keto?

1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:05.360
 I'm on, I'm on keto.

1:38:05.360 --> 1:38:07.600
 I'm doing a version of, you're keto, right?

1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:08.440
 Yeah.

1:38:08.440 --> 1:38:11.520
 So I'm doing a version of keto right now with Brad.

1:38:11.520 --> 1:38:13.200
 And it's, do you see what I mean?

1:38:13.200 --> 1:38:15.280
 You carb up in order to be able.

1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:16.120
 So it's keto with sugar.

1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:18.160
 It's called keto plus sugar.

1:38:18.160 --> 1:38:21.160
 And it's a good diet for,

1:38:21.160 --> 1:38:23.720
 I grew up in the 90s when nobody ever lost weight sadly,

1:38:23.720 --> 1:38:25.560
 because every diet was like,

1:38:25.560 --> 1:38:28.240
 you can eat what you want, just be accountable.

1:38:28.240 --> 1:38:30.000
 No one even knew what that meant.

1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:31.480
 So it would be like my mother being like,

1:38:31.480 --> 1:38:35.640
 if you have chocolate chip pancakes, have a glass of water.

1:38:35.640 --> 1:38:37.900
 Just take a walk around the block.

1:38:37.900 --> 1:38:40.040
 You can go to McDonald's three times a day.

1:38:40.040 --> 1:38:41.040
 Just walk around the block.

1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:42.080
 It's what my parents used to say.

1:38:42.080 --> 1:38:44.560
 My mother would be like, just walk around the block.

1:38:44.560 --> 1:38:45.500
 You're fine.

1:38:46.800 --> 1:38:47.680
 Gonna have a cigarette?

1:38:47.680 --> 1:38:50.000
 Walk 20 steps, walk 20 steps back.

1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:51.400
 It's exercise.

1:38:51.400 --> 1:38:54.480
 So, you know, there's too many conspiracies out there.

1:38:54.480 --> 1:38:55.320
 A lot of them aren't true.

1:38:55.320 --> 1:38:56.640
 A lot of them are bitter, angry people

1:38:56.640 --> 1:38:59.800
 trying to justify their own impotence,

1:38:59.800 --> 1:39:01.260
 not being able to do anything in life.

1:39:01.260 --> 1:39:02.100
 And they're like the people

1:39:02.100 --> 1:39:04.160
 that have done something in life, they're all nefarious.

1:39:04.160 --> 1:39:05.960
 It's all, the car just attacked against me.

1:39:05.960 --> 1:39:08.660
 That's 100% true, 100%.

1:39:08.660 --> 1:39:11.000
 It attracts usually people

1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:14.520
 that have not figured out a way to succeed

1:39:14.520 --> 1:39:17.640
 or haven't succeeded on the level that they want to.

1:39:17.640 --> 1:39:21.120
 But that also being true,

1:39:21.120 --> 1:39:25.560
 there is a fair amount of fuckery going on and provable.

1:39:25.560 --> 1:39:28.920
 And, you know, we just have to, I think, separate,

1:39:30.800 --> 1:39:34.520
 know that these things are often inflated or not true,

1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:36.160
 but know that sometimes they are true.

1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:37.920
 Otherwise it wouldn't exist.

1:39:37.920 --> 1:39:41.120
 If there was no, if there was nothing to JFK,

1:39:41.120 --> 1:39:42.640
 there was nothing to 9 11,

1:39:42.640 --> 1:39:46.520
 if people felt like they were being dealt with honestly,

1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:47.720
 this wouldn't exist.

1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:50.840
 I mean, this exists because there are real questions

1:39:50.840 --> 1:39:53.720
 that people have that don't get answered for whatever reason.

1:39:53.720 --> 1:39:57.160
 And then the vacuum of the refusal to answer those questions,

1:39:57.160 --> 1:40:00.120
 that information vacuum is filled with people

1:40:00.120 --> 1:40:02.120
 like Alex Jones, who are curious

1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:03.000
 and sometimes they're right

1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:05.320
 and sometimes they're horribly wrong.

1:40:05.320 --> 1:40:07.120
 And sometimes they're all over the place.

1:40:07.120 --> 1:40:09.100
 And they're good storytellers and people love stories.

1:40:09.100 --> 1:40:11.800
 And then when there's an absence of actual.

1:40:11.800 --> 1:40:13.900
 Alex is a uniquely American person,

1:40:13.900 --> 1:40:15.920
 like a very interesting, I don't know how many countries,

1:40:15.920 --> 1:40:18.240
 like how many people make a living as a conspiracy theorist,

1:40:18.240 --> 1:40:20.120
 a good living in other countries, right?

1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:21.640
 It's very rare, right?

1:40:21.640 --> 1:40:22.560
 I mean, it's very interesting.

1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:24.400
 And he became like, I know people that knew him

1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:25.240
 when he was a kid,

1:40:25.240 --> 1:40:27.240
 because I'd go to Austin and perform a lot.

1:40:27.240 --> 1:40:29.760
 And he was a guy that would take a bullhorn and yell at cops

1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:32.120
 because he thought DEI checkpoints were unconstitutional.

1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:33.880
 That's what he was doing in college.

1:40:33.880 --> 1:40:35.840
 And he's just went through, he was hated by the right.

1:40:35.840 --> 1:40:37.200
 He was hated by the Bush people.

1:40:37.200 --> 1:40:38.440
 He was hated by them.

1:40:38.440 --> 1:40:41.320
 And he went from being this guy

1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:44.040
 that was considered like a leftist even,

1:40:44.040 --> 1:40:45.640
 like even though he was never a leftist,

1:40:45.640 --> 1:40:48.280
 he was considered this like enemy

1:40:48.280 --> 1:40:50.880
 of mainstream conservatism.

1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:53.960
 Like he was not considered a guy that wasn't a patriot,

1:40:53.960 --> 1:40:55.840
 wasn't this, wasn't that.

1:40:55.840 --> 1:40:58.520
 And he just, wow, like he whines and whines

1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:01.000
 and ends up just being this confidant

1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:02.520
 of a Republican president,

1:41:02.520 --> 1:41:04.400
 very divisive Republican president.

1:41:04.400 --> 1:41:06.360
 And he becomes this populist and everything like that.

1:41:06.360 --> 1:41:08.060
 It's really wild to watch that.

1:41:08.060 --> 1:41:10.360
 But I mean, I do think he should retire eventually

1:41:10.360 --> 1:41:12.480
 just so we could get some, I don't know,

1:41:12.480 --> 1:41:14.880
 it seems like it's a lot to keep doing.

1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:17.560
 Well, I hope this world allows for Alex Jones

1:41:17.560 --> 1:41:20.560
 to continue having a voice because just like you said,

1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:24.220
 he's a, use the word fun,

1:41:24.220 --> 1:41:28.720
 but really he shakes up the norms of our discourse.

1:41:28.720 --> 1:41:29.560
 I do too.

1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:30.680
 I do think we need to put more value.

1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:33.880
 I think entertainment, we do need to say

1:41:33.880 --> 1:41:35.520
 that like there are people that should be allowed

1:41:35.520 --> 1:41:37.940
 to have a voice for entertainment purposes.

1:41:37.940 --> 1:41:38.780
 Right.

1:41:38.780 --> 1:41:40.920
 And that's part of what Donald Trump,

1:41:40.920 --> 1:41:42.720
 now that he's not the president,

1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:46.120
 come on, let the guy, let him talk.

1:41:46.120 --> 1:41:49.280
 Who do you think is the best comedian of all time?

1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:50.840
 Oh, that's a great question.

1:41:50.840 --> 1:41:53.000
 Greatest of all time.

1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:55.720
 You mentioned Carlin, your uncle's liking Carlin.

1:41:58.280 --> 1:42:00.640
 Well, Carlin is great.

1:42:00.640 --> 1:42:03.620
 Carlin is really hard to argue with,

1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:07.320
 but Chappelle is also really great.

1:42:08.900 --> 1:42:11.020
 Louis C.K. is really great.

1:42:11.020 --> 1:42:15.080
 I don't know that there's what Joan Rivers is great.

1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:15.920
 I don't know.

1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:16.740
 You smile at that.

1:42:16.740 --> 1:42:18.280
 Well, she's a beast of a comic.

1:42:18.280 --> 1:42:19.760
 I'm not aware of her standup actually.

1:42:19.760 --> 1:42:20.800
 She's a beast of a comic.

1:42:20.800 --> 1:42:23.200
 Ask Rogue and ask any of them.

1:42:23.200 --> 1:42:24.200
 Kennison's great.

1:42:24.200 --> 1:42:26.960
 So what makes a great comic do you think

1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:29.020
 in the history of comedy?

1:42:29.020 --> 1:42:29.860
 Just like that.

1:42:29.860 --> 1:42:33.000
 Said something at the moment in a way,

1:42:33.880 --> 1:42:35.640
 found a way to communicate with people

1:42:35.640 --> 1:42:38.200
 in the funniest possible way at that moment

1:42:38.200 --> 1:42:43.200
 and illustrated larger truths about life in what they did.

1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:46.920
 And I think that guys like Louis and Chappelle

1:42:46.920 --> 1:42:50.120
 and Pryor and Kennison and Hicks,

1:42:50.120 --> 1:42:53.160
 people like Joan Rivers have done that.

1:42:53.160 --> 1:42:55.000
 And even modern people,

1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:57.720
 people like Maria Bamford's an amazing comedian.

1:42:57.720 --> 1:43:00.440
 It's just a different style of comedy per se,

1:43:00.440 --> 1:43:03.000
 but she's an amazing comedian.

1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:05.520
 Cat Williams is an amazing comedian.

1:43:05.520 --> 1:43:06.360
 He really is.

1:43:06.360 --> 1:43:09.120
 Does he have any, was he the one of the things

1:43:09.120 --> 1:43:11.120
 you kind of mentioned, the communities you mentioned,

1:43:11.120 --> 1:43:12.720
 they were kind of fearless in saying

1:43:12.720 --> 1:43:15.240
 the difficult things that needs to be said.

1:43:15.240 --> 1:43:17.720
 Cat Williams is more, I don't remember his comedy,

1:43:17.720 --> 1:43:20.480
 but I think it's just more wild out there.

1:43:20.480 --> 1:43:21.920
 Well, to an extent that you can watch it.

1:43:21.920 --> 1:43:22.740
 He's got stuff.

1:43:22.740 --> 1:43:23.580
 He talks about stuff.

1:43:23.580 --> 1:43:24.920
 He talks about race brilliantly.

1:43:24.920 --> 1:43:26.600
 He talks about America brilliantly.

1:43:26.600 --> 1:43:28.360
 No, I think there's a lot of stuff there.

1:43:28.360 --> 1:43:29.440
 Of course, Chris Rock.

1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:30.560
 Of Chris Rock, of course.

1:43:30.560 --> 1:43:31.380
 It's so hard.

1:43:31.380 --> 1:43:32.280
 You can't really pick one.

1:43:32.280 --> 1:43:35.040
 You just gotta, there's a class of people

1:43:35.040 --> 1:43:36.980
 that throughout this history of this business,

1:43:36.980 --> 1:43:38.320
 which is not that long of a history.

1:43:38.320 --> 1:43:40.640
 It's pretty much within the last century,

1:43:41.960 --> 1:43:44.720
 that have been really influential.

1:43:44.720 --> 1:43:47.000
 Sometimes it's style, the way they deliver things.

1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:50.760
 Sometimes it's substance of how they, what they're saying,

1:43:50.760 --> 1:43:52.960
 or sometimes it's just a style of what they're saying.

1:43:52.960 --> 1:43:55.160
 And we're only talking about standup comedians, right?

1:43:55.160 --> 1:43:56.920
 So there's a million great comedians.

1:43:56.920 --> 1:43:59.720
 If we're gonna talk about Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler

1:43:59.720 --> 1:44:01.720
 and Chris Farley, these are brilliant.

1:44:01.720 --> 1:44:03.920
 And those guys are bigger influences on comedy,

1:44:03.920 --> 1:44:06.200
 I think, than standups, really, truly.

1:44:06.200 --> 1:44:09.520
 So there's so many brilliant people in the business.

1:44:09.520 --> 1:44:12.360
 Who was, for you, influential, just early on?

1:44:12.360 --> 1:44:14.300
 Hicks was influential, because I'd watch Bill Hicks,

1:44:14.300 --> 1:44:17.280
 and I'd be like, this guy's saying crazy shit on stage,

1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:18.680
 and this is the only way he can get away with it,

1:44:18.680 --> 1:44:20.160
 is because it's so funny.

1:44:20.160 --> 1:44:23.720
 And he was calling out the military industrial complex,

1:44:23.720 --> 1:44:25.300
 and he was talking about the first Gulf War.

1:44:25.300 --> 1:44:27.240
 I remember he said a joke that I heard.

1:44:27.240 --> 1:44:29.200
 It made me sit up straight, and he goes,

1:44:29.200 --> 1:44:31.200
 he was in Canada, and he said, we had a war in the States.

1:44:31.200 --> 1:44:33.080
 He was talking about the first Gulf War.

1:44:33.080 --> 1:44:35.720
 And he said, I was in the unenviable position

1:44:35.720 --> 1:44:38.900
 of being for the war, but against the troops.

1:44:38.900 --> 1:44:40.600
 And to me, I love that joke.

1:44:40.600 --> 1:44:41.880
 It was so funny to me, and I was like,

1:44:41.880 --> 1:44:44.520
 oh, you can't get away with that anywhere

1:44:44.520 --> 1:44:46.680
 other than standing on a stage.

1:44:46.680 --> 1:44:48.800
 You couldn't ever say that in an office, really.

1:44:48.800 --> 1:44:50.720
 And this was before, like, it was like PC,

1:44:50.720 --> 1:44:51.920
 and they said, the other thing,

1:44:51.920 --> 1:44:55.240
 I always knew that comedians had to say shit

1:44:55.240 --> 1:44:56.800
 and have it be funny enough

1:44:56.800 --> 1:44:58.900
 that you couldn't get away with it in polite society.

1:44:58.900 --> 1:44:59.900
 That was the whole point.

1:44:59.900 --> 1:45:02.720
 That was why it was a dark theater or a dark nightclub.

1:45:02.720 --> 1:45:03.940
 That's when people had a few drinks.

1:45:03.940 --> 1:45:06.820
 That's what the art form was, and that's why.

1:45:06.820 --> 1:45:08.160
 So a guy like that was influential

1:45:08.160 --> 1:45:09.800
 because I started watching him.

1:45:09.800 --> 1:45:12.120
 And then, of course, I loved SNL when I was a kid,

1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:13.380
 and I would watch Chris Farley,

1:45:13.380 --> 1:45:17.020
 and I would watch people like even John Belushi

1:45:17.020 --> 1:45:19.200
 going back in the day, but I'd watch Adam Sandler

1:45:19.200 --> 1:45:20.620
 and Will Ferrell and all these guys.

1:45:20.620 --> 1:45:23.120
 I mean, there's so many funny people,

1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:24.780
 but Bill Hicks was kind of funny.

1:45:24.780 --> 1:45:27.720
 And then Patrice O Neill was probably my favorite comedian

1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:29.880
 who's made me laugh more than anybody else.

1:45:29.880 --> 1:45:32.820
 So I think it was you, actually,

1:45:32.820 --> 1:45:34.980
 that maybe on your podcast,

1:45:34.980 --> 1:45:36.260
 we're talking about Patrice O Neill

1:45:36.260 --> 1:45:40.140
 and that he was actually vicious to others.

1:45:40.140 --> 1:45:42.020
 I think he was a little mean to other people,

1:45:42.020 --> 1:45:44.020
 but he was very good to people that he liked, I guess.

1:45:44.020 --> 1:45:46.320
 I think he was like not, I mean, he wasn't,

1:45:46.320 --> 1:45:47.160
 and I've never met him.

1:45:47.160 --> 1:45:49.340
 I have no inside info, but from what I've heard,

1:45:49.340 --> 1:45:51.620
 he was like no nonsense guy, right?

1:45:51.620 --> 1:45:53.180
 He just said what he wanted to say.

1:45:53.180 --> 1:45:55.700
 But I think in terms of comedians,

1:45:55.700 --> 1:45:58.300
 I don't know of anyone funnier than Patrice O Neill

1:45:58.300 --> 1:46:01.180
 who said, in modern times,

1:46:01.180 --> 1:46:03.180
 that said more about our society than him.

1:46:03.180 --> 1:46:05.300
 I mean, he was just a brilliantly funny guy.

1:46:05.300 --> 1:46:06.980
 On the radio, he was funny.

1:46:06.980 --> 1:46:08.900
 On his specials, he was funny.

1:46:08.900 --> 1:46:10.140
 Everywhere, he was funny.

1:46:10.140 --> 1:46:11.500
 And there's something else to be said

1:46:11.500 --> 1:46:15.180
 about the whole medium of comedians doing podcasts.

1:46:15.180 --> 1:46:19.100
 Because it unlocks a weird, special, new thing

1:46:19.100 --> 1:46:20.340
 that changed everything.

1:46:20.340 --> 1:46:22.700
 I mean, Rogan started with that.

1:46:22.700 --> 1:46:23.860
 You're doing that.

1:46:25.380 --> 1:46:27.620
 I think that's a whole nother form

1:46:27.620 --> 1:46:31.940
 of like standups, the ones that have a lot to say.

1:46:31.940 --> 1:46:36.580
 Almost like we get to witness the process

1:46:36.580 --> 1:46:39.620
 of the creation of the jokes in a way, or the mind.

1:46:39.620 --> 1:46:43.940
 The sort of the evolution of the mind behind the jokes.

1:46:43.940 --> 1:46:45.140
 It's just.

1:46:45.140 --> 1:46:47.160
 Comedians relate to social media.

1:46:47.160 --> 1:46:52.140
 Comedians, comedy's, it's a performance based medium.

1:46:52.140 --> 1:46:53.980
 So it's about getting up and doing it,

1:46:53.980 --> 1:46:55.900
 getting up in a club, getting up in a theater,

1:46:55.900 --> 1:46:58.780
 getting up in a bar, getting up wherever you can get up.

1:46:58.780 --> 1:47:03.060
 And comedy for years was about performance.

1:47:03.060 --> 1:47:04.100
 And then on the higher end,

1:47:04.100 --> 1:47:06.540
 it was about movies and TV shows.

1:47:06.540 --> 1:47:09.580
 But we were very slow to get on YouTube.

1:47:09.580 --> 1:47:11.940
 We're very slow to adapt to technology.

1:47:11.940 --> 1:47:16.460
 We're very slow to monetize anything we did on the internet.

1:47:16.460 --> 1:47:19.920
 So podcasting was a way for comics and funny people

1:47:19.920 --> 1:47:23.660
 to kind of get into that space, start earning money.

1:47:23.660 --> 1:47:25.140
 And now because of the pandemic,

1:47:25.140 --> 1:47:27.020
 it's really become essential.

1:47:27.020 --> 1:47:29.100
 And it helps you, and even without the pandemic,

1:47:29.100 --> 1:47:32.660
 it was how you were building a fan base.

1:47:32.660 --> 1:47:35.500
 And that's like, but comics were very reticent

1:47:35.500 --> 1:47:36.900
 to embrace social media at all

1:47:36.900 --> 1:47:39.820
 because they thought it was cheap and they didn't like it.

1:47:39.820 --> 1:47:41.460
 And they thought the people on it were idiots

1:47:41.460 --> 1:47:43.860
 and were unfunny and it was just a blatant,

1:47:43.860 --> 1:47:45.640
 whatever it was, whether it was a money grab

1:47:45.640 --> 1:47:48.500
 or it was just too commercial in a sense

1:47:48.500 --> 1:47:49.740
 where they're like, hey, look at me.

1:47:49.740 --> 1:47:51.600
 Like it was just goofy, right?

1:47:51.600 --> 1:47:56.600
 And then comics, I think got displaced

1:47:56.720 --> 1:47:58.680
 because all the YouTubers came in

1:47:58.680 --> 1:48:00.360
 and all the social media stars came in

1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:03.080
 and they really knocked comics off

1:48:03.080 --> 1:48:04.880
 because now people are much more,

1:48:04.880 --> 1:48:06.160
 like if you ask anyone under 30

1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:08.920
 who their favorite comedian is, they say David Dobrik.

1:48:08.920 --> 1:48:09.760
 And there's nothing wrong with that.

1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:13.040
 David's a funny guy, but like what you,

1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:17.420
 not especially to me a ton, but that's okay.

1:48:17.420 --> 1:48:21.600
 I don't, but he makes people laugh, so he's funny.

1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:24.720
 But he's what people, that's a comedian now.

1:48:24.720 --> 1:48:28.460
 So comics got beat by other people coming

1:48:28.460 --> 1:48:33.380
 into a digital space before they did laying the groundwork

1:48:33.380 --> 1:48:34.960
 and taking it over.

1:48:34.960 --> 1:48:38.440
 And now comics are just trying to stay alive.

1:48:38.440 --> 1:48:41.300
 Like even my podcast, which is people really like it,

1:48:41.300 --> 1:48:43.360
 thank God, and I love doing it.

1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:44.500
 The Tim Dillon Show.

1:48:44.500 --> 1:48:45.400
 Well, thank you.

1:48:45.400 --> 1:48:50.400
 I was late, you know, I mean, I was, I just, you know,

1:48:50.740 --> 1:48:52.180
 I've been podcasting for a long time,

1:48:52.180 --> 1:48:53.460
 but really dedicating myself

1:48:53.460 --> 1:48:55.620
 and putting the resources behind it, I was late to it.

1:48:55.620 --> 1:48:58.060
 Like, I was like, hey, I'm telling jokes on stage,

1:48:58.060 --> 1:49:00.540
 which is great, but I should have been allocating more time

1:49:00.540 --> 1:49:02.300
 to building an infrastructure online.

1:49:02.300 --> 1:49:04.620
 And I wasn't doing it and a lot of comics weren't doing it.

1:49:04.620 --> 1:49:06.360
 Funny comics weren't doing it.

1:49:06.360 --> 1:49:08.060
 Comics should be doing it.

1:49:08.060 --> 1:49:09.300
 And I think when the pandemic ends,

1:49:09.300 --> 1:49:12.180
 a lot of comics will just keep doing live standup,

1:49:12.180 --> 1:49:14.620
 but I will keep, obviously I'm gonna go back on the road

1:49:14.620 --> 1:49:16.620
 and do live standup, but I will keep doing this podcast

1:49:16.620 --> 1:49:17.460
 and building digitally too.

1:49:17.460 --> 1:49:19.260
 But you're also exploring ideas.

1:49:19.260 --> 1:49:21.660
 You're doing like short videos and so on.

1:49:21.660 --> 1:49:26.180
 You're trying to look for different mediums of how to be funny.

1:49:26.180 --> 1:49:27.340
 I wanna be funny everywhere.

1:49:27.340 --> 1:49:28.300
 I wanna be funny everywhere.

1:49:28.300 --> 1:49:29.500
 I love making things too.

1:49:29.500 --> 1:49:33.180
 My producer, Ben Avery, is like a brilliant editor

1:49:33.180 --> 1:49:36.100
 and comedic mind, even though he's not a standup.

1:49:36.100 --> 1:49:38.100
 He's able to, he understands funny,

1:49:38.100 --> 1:49:39.220
 he understands what makes me funny.

1:49:39.220 --> 1:49:41.980
 We're able to make these really, I mean,

1:49:41.980 --> 1:49:44.060
 some of those videos, they're just brilliant little videos,

1:49:44.060 --> 1:49:45.460
 even though they're tiny little videos,

1:49:45.460 --> 1:49:47.580
 they're fucking as funny as anything.

1:49:47.580 --> 1:49:48.860
 And it's not me.

1:49:48.860 --> 1:49:50.900
 It's me working with somebody else

1:49:50.900 --> 1:49:52.860
 to make something really great.

1:49:52.860 --> 1:49:56.820
 And it's that relationship that's very important.

1:49:56.820 --> 1:50:00.180
 In some sense, the medium of a short video is a challenge,

1:50:00.180 --> 1:50:02.260
 just like the medium of a short tweet.

1:50:02.260 --> 1:50:03.100
 Of course.

1:50:03.100 --> 1:50:04.980
 How to say something.

1:50:04.980 --> 1:50:08.980
 I mean, whatever the flavor is of what's in your heart,

1:50:08.980 --> 1:50:10.460
 what's in your mind, how to say it,

1:50:10.460 --> 1:50:13.660
 whether it's the goal is funny or something,

1:50:13.660 --> 1:50:15.780
 or just an expressing idea.

1:50:15.780 --> 1:50:18.220
 I think the whole thing that's important to us

1:50:18.220 --> 1:50:20.220
 is that it's an extension of,

1:50:20.220 --> 1:50:22.340
 really like an extension of your friendship in a way.

1:50:22.340 --> 1:50:24.580
 Like, are you guys laughing at it?

1:50:24.580 --> 1:50:27.940
 Are you guys making each other laugh about this idea?

1:50:27.940 --> 1:50:29.220
 And if that's the case,

1:50:29.220 --> 1:50:31.860
 other people are going to laugh at it.

1:50:31.860 --> 1:50:34.260
 I think so much of the old medium was like,

1:50:34.260 --> 1:50:35.860
 everything was top down.

1:50:35.860 --> 1:50:37.260
 Okay, pitch me this idea.

1:50:37.260 --> 1:50:38.700
 I pitch it to the showrunner.

1:50:38.700 --> 1:50:39.900
 They pitch it to the network.

1:50:39.900 --> 1:50:42.020
 They pitch it to this, to that, to that.

1:50:42.020 --> 1:50:43.820
 Standards and practices, sales,

1:50:43.820 --> 1:50:45.500
 and we got to go through everything.

1:50:45.500 --> 1:50:48.020
 Now it's just like, are me and a few buddies

1:50:48.020 --> 1:50:51.260
 or even just one buddy laughing at this idea?

1:50:51.260 --> 1:50:52.740
 Does it captivate us?

1:50:52.740 --> 1:50:55.100
 And do we see it visually?

1:50:55.100 --> 1:50:58.620
 And also a great line from Roseanne,

1:50:58.620 --> 1:51:01.940
 a guy, not Roseanne, but a guy that worked on Roseanne,

1:51:01.940 --> 1:51:03.300
 the old Roseanne, the great one.

1:51:03.300 --> 1:51:06.700
 He said, is it funny with the sound off?

1:51:06.700 --> 1:51:07.540
 Right.

1:51:07.540 --> 1:51:08.380
 That's what we try to do.

1:51:08.380 --> 1:51:09.200
 That's brilliant.

1:51:09.200 --> 1:51:10.100
 Is it funny with the sound off?

1:51:10.100 --> 1:51:11.900
 When you see me in the dumb things,

1:51:11.900 --> 1:51:15.140
 or me in the Meghan McCain, or me in the thing,

1:51:15.140 --> 1:51:15.980
 is it funny with the sound off?

1:51:15.980 --> 1:51:17.500
 And if it's funny with the sound off,

1:51:17.500 --> 1:51:18.620
 you have a good starting point.

1:51:18.620 --> 1:51:20.820
 That's hilarious, because you,

1:51:20.820 --> 1:51:22.820
 I would say you're one of the people,

1:51:22.820 --> 1:51:25.180
 because most people are not funny with the sound off,

1:51:25.180 --> 1:51:26.020
 most comedians.

1:51:26.020 --> 1:51:28.880
 Like you, Will Ferrell's another example of that.

1:51:28.880 --> 1:51:32.620
 There's something about when I click on one of your videos,

1:51:32.620 --> 1:51:36.820
 it's funny, just like the first thing I see, just your face.

1:51:36.820 --> 1:51:37.780
 We, well, thank you.

1:51:37.780 --> 1:51:38.620
 That's very sweet.

1:51:38.620 --> 1:51:40.280
 But I mean, thank God.

1:51:40.280 --> 1:51:41.620
 I mean, that's what we try to do, right?

1:51:41.620 --> 1:51:42.620
 We're trying to be funny.

1:51:42.620 --> 1:51:43.460
 Yeah.

1:51:43.460 --> 1:51:45.020
 So we're trying to be funny.

1:51:45.020 --> 1:51:46.540
 Can we talk about love a little bit?

1:51:46.540 --> 1:51:48.100
 Sure.

1:51:48.100 --> 1:51:52.420
 So you came out of the closet as being gay

1:51:52.420 --> 1:51:53.700
 when you were 25.

1:51:53.700 --> 1:51:55.780
 Yeah, it was late, very late.

1:51:55.780 --> 1:51:56.620
 Very late.

1:51:56.620 --> 1:51:57.460
 Before then.

1:51:57.460 --> 1:51:58.280
 By today's standards.

1:51:58.280 --> 1:52:03.280
 During and after, how has your view on love evolved?

1:52:04.880 --> 1:52:05.720
 Interesting.

1:52:05.720 --> 1:52:08.300
 It's so hard to say, because like I would,

1:52:08.300 --> 1:52:12.240
 I'd like to make a very like Disneyfied statement

1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:15.700
 about like that you can't be in love secretively.

1:52:15.700 --> 1:52:16.660
 You should be honest.

1:52:16.660 --> 1:52:18.980
 Love should all be about honesty, but that's not true.

1:52:18.980 --> 1:52:19.820
 Right?

1:52:19.820 --> 1:52:21.420
 There's people that are in love

1:52:21.420 --> 1:52:23.620
 that are lying to everyone else,

1:52:23.620 --> 1:52:24.940
 but they're deeply in love.

1:52:24.940 --> 1:52:25.860
 Yeah.

1:52:25.860 --> 1:52:27.020
 I would love to say something like,

1:52:27.020 --> 1:52:30.140
 honesty is an ingredient for love, you know?

1:52:30.140 --> 1:52:33.020
 But I don't know, maybe honesty with each other.

1:52:33.020 --> 1:52:35.800
 But I mean, I think there's a lot of people in the world

1:52:35.800 --> 1:52:36.980
 that aren't honest.

1:52:36.980 --> 1:52:39.380
 My view on love is super important.

1:52:39.380 --> 1:52:43.460
 I think that it's, a lot of society in America

1:52:43.460 --> 1:52:44.820
 is all about love.

1:52:44.820 --> 1:52:49.020
 We don't tend to focus on other things

1:52:49.020 --> 1:52:51.980
 in terms of like, you know, friendship

1:52:51.980 --> 1:52:54.740
 or sustainability of that.

1:52:54.740 --> 1:52:55.620
 Cause I think that a lot,

1:52:55.620 --> 1:52:58.320
 I know a lot of people in relationships where it's like,

1:52:58.320 --> 1:53:01.180
 I don't know, they're not, they are, they love each other,

1:53:01.180 --> 1:53:03.980
 but like, it's also a rock solid couple

1:53:03.980 --> 1:53:07.700
 because they are, they're very compatible

1:53:07.700 --> 1:53:09.020
 in many other ways.

1:53:09.020 --> 1:53:09.860
 Right.

1:53:09.860 --> 1:53:10.700
 So I think that like,

1:53:10.700 --> 1:53:11.520
 They're friends.

1:53:11.520 --> 1:53:12.360
 They have, right.

1:53:12.360 --> 1:53:13.980
 I see friendship and love as the same thing.

1:53:13.980 --> 1:53:15.260
 There's just parts of it that are, right?

1:53:15.260 --> 1:53:18.300
 So it's like, I look at it as like,

1:53:18.300 --> 1:53:21.700
 there is, there needs to be more than just like that,

1:53:21.700 --> 1:53:25.860
 like amazing, like chemistry or physical attraction

1:53:25.860 --> 1:53:28.580
 that is this chemical thing that happens.

1:53:28.580 --> 1:53:30.420
 There should be like some underlying,

1:53:30.420 --> 1:53:32.820
 I mean, again, that's from what I,

1:53:32.820 --> 1:53:36.100
 that's what I've observed as really long lasting,

1:53:36.100 --> 1:53:37.620
 successful relationships.

1:53:37.620 --> 1:53:40.900
 Well, is there something about coming out that,

1:53:42.380 --> 1:53:45.820
 that was, that you took away,

1:53:45.820 --> 1:53:47.680
 that you remember as profound,

1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:48.520
 Yes.

1:53:48.520 --> 1:53:52.680
 That it was my, that I, it wasn't society, it was me.

1:53:52.680 --> 1:53:55.180
 So there were kids that were out in my high school

1:53:55.180 --> 1:53:58.580
 that I waited years later to do it.

1:53:58.580 --> 1:54:00.460
 That was no one's fault but my own.

1:54:00.460 --> 1:54:02.640
 So I was taking a cowardly way out

1:54:02.640 --> 1:54:03.500
 and a lot of people.

1:54:03.500 --> 1:54:06.060
 So I could blame society or like,

1:54:06.060 --> 1:54:07.820
 oh, I lived in a conservative area

1:54:07.820 --> 1:54:09.780
 and I grew up in that.

1:54:09.780 --> 1:54:11.820
 You should take responsibility for your own decisions.

1:54:11.820 --> 1:54:12.740
 And if you're being cowardly,

1:54:12.740 --> 1:54:14.460
 admit that you're being cowardly.

1:54:14.460 --> 1:54:16.180
 So that's what I took out of it is that

1:54:16.180 --> 1:54:19.180
 it's not society's fault that you chose to be a coward.

1:54:19.180 --> 1:54:21.060
 Society will never be perfect.

1:54:21.060 --> 1:54:23.540
 You have to be honest when you're ready to be honest

1:54:23.540 --> 1:54:25.120
 or however you want to be honest,

1:54:25.120 --> 1:54:26.800
 but it's not somebody, too much now

1:54:26.800 --> 1:54:29.860
 is it's everyone else's fault that you didn't take,

1:54:29.860 --> 1:54:31.580
 make a hard choice or a hard decision.

1:54:31.580 --> 1:54:33.700
 So that's kind of what I took out of it.

1:54:33.700 --> 1:54:36.320
 So now in retrospect, you see yourself as,

1:54:36.320 --> 1:54:38.180
 were being afraid.

1:54:38.180 --> 1:54:40.740
 Do you think at the time?

1:54:40.740 --> 1:54:42.100
 Well, I wanted people to like me,

1:54:42.100 --> 1:54:45.080
 which is the disease of humanity, right?

1:54:45.080 --> 1:54:46.180
 Is that we want to be liked.

1:54:46.180 --> 1:54:48.780
 And what happens is if you want people to like you

1:54:48.780 --> 1:54:49.660
 and love you even,

1:54:49.660 --> 1:54:52.060
 you want people to feel comfortable with you.

1:54:52.060 --> 1:54:53.740
 And those were people like your family?

1:54:53.740 --> 1:54:55.140
 Friends more.

1:54:55.140 --> 1:54:56.380
 My family I would always,

1:54:56.380 --> 1:54:57.940
 could always throw in the street,

1:54:57.940 --> 1:54:59.580
 but I'm kidding.

1:54:59.580 --> 1:55:01.820
 I mean, but I am not,

1:55:01.820 --> 1:55:03.660
 but my friends, my circle of friends,

1:55:03.660 --> 1:55:06.820
 which I were my family at the time when you're a senior,

1:55:06.820 --> 1:55:08.380
 when you're 10th, 11th grade in high school,

1:55:08.380 --> 1:55:09.940
 your friends are your family.

1:55:09.940 --> 1:55:10.780
 You know what I mean?

1:55:10.780 --> 1:55:11.680
 Like that's your,

1:55:11.680 --> 1:55:12.780
 so you don't want to do anything

1:55:12.780 --> 1:55:15.260
 that puts you on the outside of the circle.

1:55:15.260 --> 1:55:16.760
 It's just thinking back to that fear.

1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:19.360
 Is there things you're afraid of now?

1:55:19.360 --> 1:55:21.880
 That you're not doing, you're afraid to do?

1:55:21.880 --> 1:55:23.980
 I'm afraid of all kinds of things.

1:55:23.980 --> 1:55:26.540
 I'm afraid of not being good at my job,

1:55:26.540 --> 1:55:29.900
 not being funny, letting people down,

1:55:29.900 --> 1:55:33.220
 not putting out products that are good,

1:55:33.220 --> 1:55:36.020
 whether it's the podcast every week or stand up

1:55:36.020 --> 1:55:36.860
 or the videos,

1:55:36.860 --> 1:55:37.780
 like I'm afraid of like,

1:55:37.780 --> 1:55:40.160
 there's a ton of people that really enjoy what we do.

1:55:40.160 --> 1:55:41.620
 So when you're in that position,

1:55:41.620 --> 1:55:44.540
 you're nervous that you're going to start doing things

1:55:44.540 --> 1:55:45.380
 that they don't like.

1:55:45.380 --> 1:55:46.900
 So the new things you want to do,

1:55:46.900 --> 1:55:48.500
 the evolution you want to do,

1:55:48.500 --> 1:55:51.060
 you want to make sure you're evolving in the right way.

1:55:51.060 --> 1:55:52.460
 You want to make sure that you're doing things

1:55:52.460 --> 1:55:54.540
 that are consistent with why people liked you,

1:55:54.540 --> 1:55:56.660
 but also you don't want to put yourself in a box

1:55:56.660 --> 1:55:59.780
 and limit what you can be going forward.

1:55:59.780 --> 1:56:02.980
 So like, I had a talk with the CEO of NBC Universal once.

1:56:02.980 --> 1:56:05.740
 I was doing some internal sketch for them.

1:56:05.740 --> 1:56:08.660
 And I was playing like a cab driver and he was a,

1:56:08.660 --> 1:56:10.820
 and he's not the current CEO, but he's a former CEO.

1:56:10.820 --> 1:56:12.700
 And I said to him, what's the hardest part of running

1:56:12.700 --> 1:56:14.820
 a corporation of this size?

1:56:14.820 --> 1:56:17.100
 And he said something very interesting.

1:56:17.100 --> 1:56:18.980
 He said, the hardest part is maximizing

1:56:18.980 --> 1:56:22.460
 the current profit model of what you have

1:56:22.460 --> 1:56:25.220
 at the same time, getting ready, getting ready,

1:56:25.220 --> 1:56:26.140
 getting the company ready

1:56:26.140 --> 1:56:27.940
 for where it's going to be in five years.

1:56:27.940 --> 1:56:29.780
 He said, those are often at odds.

1:56:29.780 --> 1:56:30.980
 And that's the toughest thing.

1:56:30.980 --> 1:56:32.900
 He goes, cause I could just bang out

1:56:32.900 --> 1:56:34.100
 everything I got to do right now.

1:56:34.100 --> 1:56:35.860
 And we're going to make a lot of money doing this,

1:56:35.860 --> 1:56:37.900
 but am I devoting enough resources into digital

1:56:37.900 --> 1:56:39.940
 so that in five years, when that's where everything lives,

1:56:39.940 --> 1:56:42.220
 are we competitive in that space?

1:56:42.220 --> 1:56:44.900
 So as funny as I am now, hopefully to people

1:56:44.900 --> 1:56:46.540
 and a lot of the things that I want to do now,

1:56:46.540 --> 1:56:49.900
 I'm going, what am I, what groundwork am I not laying

1:56:49.900 --> 1:56:52.060
 for three to five years down the road

1:56:52.060 --> 1:56:55.620
 so that I can be adapting to the trends

1:56:55.620 --> 1:56:58.420
 that are important then in terms of not so much

1:56:58.420 --> 1:57:01.540
 comedic trends, but like the technological trends,

1:57:01.540 --> 1:57:04.340
 like what is the, what is the, you know,

1:57:04.340 --> 1:57:06.220
 I should have done podcasting earlier.

1:57:06.220 --> 1:57:09.100
 What should I, should I have a bigger presence on TikTok?

1:57:09.100 --> 1:57:10.220
 Should I have a bigger presence here?

1:57:10.220 --> 1:57:12.100
 Should I have a business, or should I be on Twitch?

1:57:12.100 --> 1:57:12.940
 Should I be doing this?

1:57:12.940 --> 1:57:13.780
 Should I be doing that?

1:57:13.780 --> 1:57:15.540
 What am I not doing that I should be doing

1:57:15.540 --> 1:57:17.260
 that I'll regret not doing?

1:57:17.260 --> 1:57:19.820
 And those are, those are the conversations

1:57:19.820 --> 1:57:21.420
 I think I have in my own head all the time.

1:57:21.420 --> 1:57:23.300
 And I guess there's parallels to coming out as gay

1:57:23.300 --> 1:57:26.140
 or just parallels in like a career path

1:57:26.140 --> 1:57:29.980
 so you're taking all that, that's ultimately just fear.

1:57:29.980 --> 1:57:31.220
 It's fear. Yeah.

1:57:31.220 --> 1:57:34.620
 It's the fear of, you know, the best thing that happened

1:57:34.620 --> 1:57:37.020
 in my career was that I came to LA.

1:57:37.020 --> 1:57:41.740
 I didn't have an idea of what was going to happen.

1:57:41.740 --> 1:57:45.660
 I met somebody who was really committed

1:57:45.660 --> 1:57:50.020
 to making funny things that we just wanted to be funny.

1:57:50.020 --> 1:57:51.220
 No one would let us be funny.

1:57:51.220 --> 1:57:53.860
 We didn't have Comedy Central letting us be funny.

1:57:53.860 --> 1:57:55.660
 We didn't have HBO, we didn't have Netflix.

1:57:55.660 --> 1:57:58.100
 We just had a garage and a phone in the beginning

1:57:58.100 --> 1:58:00.220
 and then a camera and then a thing.

1:58:00.220 --> 1:58:01.700
 And we just wanted to be funny.

1:58:01.700 --> 1:58:03.980
 And that was the greatest risk really I took

1:58:03.980 --> 1:58:06.060
 because I was like, well, I don't know what else

1:58:06.060 --> 1:58:08.640
 is going to happen right now, but I just want to be funny.

1:58:08.640 --> 1:58:10.180
 And funny saved my life, right?

1:58:10.180 --> 1:58:11.580
 I mean, funny got me out of drugs.

1:58:11.580 --> 1:58:12.940
 Funny probably got me out of the closet.

1:58:12.940 --> 1:58:14.960
 Funny was the thing that I was able to do

1:58:14.960 --> 1:58:16.800
 that made everything okay in my own head.

1:58:16.800 --> 1:58:18.120
 So I was like, as long as I'm being funny,

1:58:18.120 --> 1:58:19.020
 something good will happen.

1:58:19.020 --> 1:58:21.700
 So we did that and then something really cool happened

1:58:21.700 --> 1:58:23.740
 that we were able to do a lot of cool things,

1:58:23.740 --> 1:58:25.660
 but that's what it is.

1:58:25.660 --> 1:58:27.520
 It's fear that keeps you from being

1:58:27.520 --> 1:58:29.340
 the better version of yourself.

1:58:29.340 --> 1:58:33.540
 Your mom, I mean, you have so many complicated,

1:58:33.540 --> 1:58:34.900
 fascinating parts of your story.

1:58:34.900 --> 1:58:35.900
 Oh, thank you.

1:58:35.900 --> 1:58:39.340
 Your mom, as you were growing up, suffered.

1:58:39.340 --> 1:58:40.180
 Schizophrenic, yeah.

1:58:40.180 --> 1:58:43.460
 Well, from mental illness, yeah, schizophrenia.

1:58:43.460 --> 1:58:45.780
 Can you tell her story and how that relationship

1:58:45.780 --> 1:58:46.940
 has changed over the years?

1:58:46.940 --> 1:58:49.700
 Yeah, well, she was always eccentric and always,

1:58:49.700 --> 1:58:51.380
 you know, the terms for schizophrenia

1:58:51.380 --> 1:58:52.780
 in an Irish Catholic household

1:58:52.780 --> 1:58:56.180
 where we didn't talk about anything were eccentric, fun.

1:58:56.180 --> 1:58:57.420
 She's fun.

1:58:57.420 --> 1:58:58.260
 There's a theme to this conversation.

1:58:58.260 --> 1:58:59.860
 She's unpredictable.

1:58:59.860 --> 1:59:04.860
 She's a wire, she was a live wire.

1:59:04.980 --> 1:59:06.740
 Any of the words you would use to describe somebody

1:59:06.740 --> 1:59:09.880
 who was a fucking lunatic, but you wouldn't say that.

1:59:11.660 --> 1:59:12.700
 Pop that spin.

1:59:12.700 --> 1:59:17.060
 Right, she started experiencing symptoms

1:59:17.060 --> 1:59:18.260
 probably early on in her life,

1:59:18.260 --> 1:59:22.620
 but she also, I think, started really manifesting them

1:59:22.620 --> 1:59:27.620
 when I was in my mid teens, so like 14, 13, 14 area.

1:59:29.400 --> 1:59:30.980
 And she got really, really bad.

1:59:30.980 --> 1:59:33.060
 And then I think she was institutionalized

1:59:33.060 --> 1:59:35.900
 about 10 years ago, a little over 10 years ago.

1:59:35.900 --> 1:59:37.740
 And she could really no longer live on her own.

1:59:37.740 --> 1:59:39.520
 She was unable to go to work.

1:59:39.520 --> 1:59:40.880
 She was unable to function.

1:59:40.880 --> 1:59:42.060
 So I visit her when I can.

1:59:42.060 --> 1:59:42.940
 Obviously, I'm not in New York.

1:59:42.940 --> 1:59:44.420
 Whenever I go to New York, I visit her.

1:59:44.420 --> 1:59:47.260
 She's aware of what I do, my career and everything like that.

1:59:47.260 --> 1:59:48.380
 She has good days and bad days,

1:59:48.380 --> 1:59:51.440
 but mental illness is a thing that's very tough.

1:59:51.440 --> 1:59:53.180
 We don't talk about it as a society.

1:59:53.180 --> 1:59:57.220
 People with mental problems don't get that much attention.

1:59:57.220 --> 2:00:00.340
 We tend to think that they did something wrong

2:00:00.340 --> 2:00:04.620
 or that they deserve it or that they are to be ignored.

2:00:04.620 --> 2:00:06.500
 And we don't devote a lot of resources into it,

2:00:06.500 --> 2:00:09.140
 which is unfortunate because then you have the junk gurus

2:00:09.140 --> 2:00:10.100
 come in and go like,

2:00:10.100 --> 2:00:12.500
 let's diagnose your mental illness off Instagram.

2:00:12.500 --> 2:00:14.260
 And it's like, that's not the move.

2:00:15.140 --> 2:00:15.980
 Yeah.

2:00:15.980 --> 2:00:17.500
 Do you love her?

2:00:17.500 --> 2:00:19.220
 I do, I do.

2:00:19.220 --> 2:00:24.220
 I love her, but I also remember her that isn't her now.

2:00:24.220 --> 2:00:28.000
 And when someone has mental illness that's severe,

2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:31.180
 you make peace with their death before they die.

2:00:31.180 --> 2:00:32.080
 Wow, yeah.

2:00:32.080 --> 2:00:36.340
 Because the part of them that you love and remember

2:00:36.340 --> 2:00:41.340
 a lot of cases is not evident or obvious.

2:00:41.580 --> 2:00:44.060
 Now, my mother's still a loving person that I love,

2:00:44.060 --> 2:00:49.060
 but the fun, her ability to be present in the moment

2:00:49.540 --> 2:00:54.540
 and to not, that is lost with the progression of realness

2:00:54.940 --> 2:00:56.260
 so that you still love her.

2:00:56.260 --> 2:00:59.220
 And I mean, again, your parents,

2:00:59.220 --> 2:01:01.620
 the time horizons you have with your parents are unknown.

2:01:01.620 --> 2:01:02.460
 People don't know.

2:01:02.460 --> 2:01:04.640
 I have friends that their parents were in their lives

2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:06.060
 for their entire life.

2:01:06.060 --> 2:01:07.740
 And I have friends whose parents were in their life,

2:01:07.740 --> 2:01:10.020
 but my mother was a very, she knew what I was.

2:01:10.020 --> 2:01:11.340
 When I was a little kid, I was an actor.

2:01:11.340 --> 2:01:12.980
 When I was like six to 12,

2:01:12.980 --> 2:01:14.340
 my mother knew that I was a performer.

2:01:14.340 --> 2:01:16.320
 She knew what I was and what I'd ultimately do.

2:01:16.320 --> 2:01:17.540
 She recognized that in me.

2:01:17.540 --> 2:01:19.280
 And when I said to her, I want to audition for shows,

2:01:19.280 --> 2:01:20.540
 I want to be on stage, I want to be on this,

2:01:20.540 --> 2:01:22.980
 I want to do this, she let me do it

2:01:22.980 --> 2:01:24.460
 because she knew who I was

2:01:24.460 --> 2:01:25.900
 and she didn't want to get in the way

2:01:25.900 --> 2:01:30.660
 of me being a human being, a fully realized person at six.

2:01:30.660 --> 2:01:33.400
 So that's probably the best thing a parent can do for a kid

2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:35.900
 is let them be who they are.

2:01:35.900 --> 2:01:37.700
 And my mother did that.

2:01:37.700 --> 2:01:39.140
 So that, I mean, that's good.

2:01:40.300 --> 2:01:42.740
 We ate too much fast food.

2:01:42.740 --> 2:01:44.820
 There were negatives, but she did let me be who I was.

2:01:44.820 --> 2:01:46.780
 That's why you want to throw them out into the street.

2:01:46.780 --> 2:01:48.060
 Yeah, sometimes.

2:01:50.740 --> 2:01:55.740
 But coming to accept the mortality of her,

2:01:57.520 --> 2:02:00.980
 I guess, identity as you remember it from childhood,

2:02:00.980 --> 2:02:04.260
 do you ponder your own mortality?

2:02:04.260 --> 2:02:06.100
 Are you afraid of death?

2:02:06.100 --> 2:02:06.940
 I'm afraid of death.

2:02:06.940 --> 2:02:10.420
 I don't like the idea of death, but I know it's happening.

2:02:10.420 --> 2:02:12.340
 I know it's going to happen eventually.

2:02:12.340 --> 2:02:13.180
 I don't love it.

2:02:13.180 --> 2:02:14.140
 Do you think about it?

2:02:14.140 --> 2:02:15.700
 I think about, I want to do some good stuff

2:02:15.700 --> 2:02:16.900
 that people can look back at.

2:02:16.900 --> 2:02:18.340
 And I think I'm proud of the show

2:02:18.340 --> 2:02:19.820
 where if people look back at the show,

2:02:19.820 --> 2:02:21.580
 I don't know how comedy ages or whatever,

2:02:21.580 --> 2:02:23.420
 but I think I put out a lot of stuff

2:02:23.420 --> 2:02:24.780
 and I want to continue to put out stuff

2:02:24.780 --> 2:02:26.060
 and I want to put out a few specials

2:02:26.060 --> 2:02:27.740
 that people can look back at and go,

2:02:27.740 --> 2:02:30.520
 oh, this guy was really funny in this really crazy,

2:02:30.520 --> 2:02:32.780
 he lived in the latter part of this century

2:02:32.780 --> 2:02:33.920
 when all this shit was going on.

2:02:33.920 --> 2:02:35.620
 And he kind of made fun of it.

2:02:35.620 --> 2:02:40.620
 And he did something to make people's lives a little better

2:02:40.660 --> 2:02:43.660
 just by having a few laughs.

2:02:43.660 --> 2:02:45.300
 What do you think about,

2:02:45.300 --> 2:02:48.460
 this is something like in the podcast context,

2:02:48.460 --> 2:02:53.020
 do you think you'll have just one or two or three shows

2:02:53.020 --> 2:02:56.940
 out of thousands maybe that are like the truly special ones?

2:02:56.940 --> 2:02:57.900
 That's probably the case.

2:02:57.900 --> 2:03:00.700
 Or do you think it's an entirety of the body of work?

2:03:00.700 --> 2:03:02.900
 I think people will take 10 minute clips

2:03:02.900 --> 2:03:05.380
 from all different shows and put them together.

2:03:05.380 --> 2:03:06.300
 And there's a highlight.

2:03:06.300 --> 2:03:08.000
 Yeah, like a highlight reel of just like,

2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:10.900
 these are like the best things that he's ever done

2:03:10.900 --> 2:03:12.340
 or the best rants he's ever had,

2:03:12.340 --> 2:03:13.420
 the best things, whatever.

2:03:13.420 --> 2:03:16.980
 So the legacy would be that this was an important voice

2:03:16.980 --> 2:03:18.900
 in a very weird time.

2:03:18.900 --> 2:03:21.580
 I would hope that that's part of it.

2:03:21.580 --> 2:03:24.020
 And I hope that I continue to be,

2:03:24.020 --> 2:03:25.860
 you say important, I say funny,

2:03:25.860 --> 2:03:28.380
 but hopefully I continue to be a voice.

2:03:28.380 --> 2:03:30.460
 And that's what I think when I think about death,

2:03:30.460 --> 2:03:33.420
 I think about like, what do people come on earth to do?

2:03:33.420 --> 2:03:34.500
 And I think I came,

2:03:34.500 --> 2:03:37.260
 I think my main purpose on this planet

2:03:37.260 --> 2:03:39.940
 other than to experience whatever love

2:03:39.940 --> 2:03:44.580
 or worthiness or whatever is to entertain people.

2:03:44.580 --> 2:03:46.180
 And there's a lot of people in comedy right now

2:03:46.180 --> 2:03:49.780
 that are not entertainers, and that's really the problem.

2:03:49.780 --> 2:03:51.660
 But, and they got into comedy sort of the way

2:03:51.660 --> 2:03:55.420
 that you can walk into the wrong store in a mall

2:03:55.420 --> 2:03:57.500
 and then not realize you're in the wrong store

2:03:57.500 --> 2:03:58.800
 and try on a bunch of clothes and then go,

2:03:58.800 --> 2:04:00.940
 fuck, I wasted my whole afternoon.

2:04:00.940 --> 2:04:02.720
 But I think I've always kind of been an entertainer

2:04:02.720 --> 2:04:04.140
 and that's what I wanna do.

2:04:04.140 --> 2:04:07.020
 There's a, unfortunately, sadly,

2:04:07.020 --> 2:04:08.940
 a lot of people that look up to you.

2:04:08.940 --> 2:04:12.360
 That is a horrible thing, but life is a nightmare.

2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:13.200
 Yeah.

2:04:14.420 --> 2:04:16.780
 If you were to give them advice,

2:04:16.780 --> 2:04:20.320
 young folks, people in college, maybe even high school,

2:04:20.320 --> 2:04:24.460
 but people in their 20s about what to do with their life,

2:04:24.460 --> 2:04:27.120
 whether it's career, whether it's just life in general,

2:04:27.120 --> 2:04:27.960
 what would you say?

2:04:27.960 --> 2:04:29.580
 Ignore everyone.

2:04:29.580 --> 2:04:31.340
 Make a few good friends.

2:04:32.540 --> 2:04:37.540
 Truly have honest conversations with yourself about your,

2:04:39.060 --> 2:04:42.500
 when do you feel the most alive?

2:04:42.500 --> 2:04:44.340
 Figure that out.

2:04:44.340 --> 2:04:47.220
 When and how do you feel the most alive?

2:04:47.220 --> 2:04:48.340
 Yeah.

2:04:48.340 --> 2:04:50.300
 Figure that out.

2:04:50.300 --> 2:04:52.180
 Try to figure out a job or a career

2:04:52.180 --> 2:04:53.880
 that can replicate that feeling.

2:04:56.240 --> 2:04:57.460
 Don't listen to anyone.

2:04:57.460 --> 2:04:58.860
 Don't listen to your parents.

2:04:58.860 --> 2:05:01.140
 Don't listen to the gurus on the internet.

2:05:01.140 --> 2:05:02.540
 Don't listen to me.

2:05:02.540 --> 2:05:03.780
 Don't listen to anyone.

2:05:03.780 --> 2:05:07.500
 Figure out where you feel the most alive.

2:05:07.500 --> 2:05:09.100
 Where do you feel excited?

2:05:09.100 --> 2:05:11.460
 Where does your pulse quicken?

2:05:11.460 --> 2:05:13.640
 What do you feel matters?

2:05:13.640 --> 2:05:16.380
 When you're in a situation, do you feel like it matters?

2:05:17.260 --> 2:05:18.580
 What situation was that?

2:05:18.580 --> 2:05:20.460
 What got you excited?

2:05:20.460 --> 2:05:24.440
 What thing did you walk into where you looked around

2:05:24.440 --> 2:05:25.800
 and were taken back and you're like,

2:05:25.800 --> 2:05:27.180
 wow, this is amazing?

2:05:27.180 --> 2:05:28.980
 And I'm filled with awe.

2:05:28.980 --> 2:05:33.980
 If you can figure out a life where you can excite yourself,

2:05:34.040 --> 2:05:37.980
 you might not use drugs or alcohol or a sex addiction

2:05:37.980 --> 2:05:41.100
 or gambling or irresponsibility.

2:05:41.100 --> 2:05:44.140
 You might not have to get your fucking kicks

2:05:44.140 --> 2:05:46.440
 in very destructive places

2:05:46.440 --> 2:05:48.900
 if you can get them in a productive place.

2:05:48.900 --> 2:05:53.020
 Well, you had a pretty weaving life

2:05:53.020 --> 2:05:56.860
 that's full of mistakes and so on.

2:05:56.860 --> 2:05:58.080
 Many mistakes.

2:05:59.700 --> 2:06:02.220
 Is that, are mistakes a bug or a feature?

2:06:02.220 --> 2:06:05.220
 Like, do you recommend embrace the mistakes,

2:06:05.220 --> 2:06:06.060
 make a bunch of them?

2:06:06.060 --> 2:06:07.500
 Depends what they are, right?

2:06:07.500 --> 2:06:08.340
 So.

2:06:08.340 --> 2:06:09.900
 Well, you've had the full spectrum.

2:06:09.900 --> 2:06:12.640
 I've had a lot, but a lot of mine could have sunk me.

2:06:12.640 --> 2:06:13.480
 Right.

2:06:13.480 --> 2:06:15.240
 Like, they sound like fun when I talk about them,

2:06:15.240 --> 2:06:17.740
 but they actually could have sunk me.

2:06:17.740 --> 2:06:21.380
 And they were all part of what made me funny,

2:06:21.380 --> 2:06:22.860
 but I don't know.

2:06:22.860 --> 2:06:25.020
 I would never tell anyone else

2:06:25.020 --> 2:06:26.780
 to just light their life on fire

2:06:26.780 --> 2:06:28.620
 and hope it all works out on the other end.

2:06:28.620 --> 2:06:30.760
 It would be pretty irresponsible.

2:06:30.760 --> 2:06:34.700
 But hey, at the end of the day, it's like,

2:06:34.700 --> 2:06:39.080
 you're gonna, we get, there's, you know,

2:06:39.080 --> 2:06:41.660
 I think one of my themes is that there's too much.

2:06:41.660 --> 2:06:42.780
 We give the power.

2:06:42.780 --> 2:06:46.180
 We think we have too, the power of choice

2:06:46.180 --> 2:06:50.420
 has been elevated on our society to an unhealthy degree.

2:06:50.420 --> 2:06:53.500
 I think people are, I think you could get really good

2:06:53.500 --> 2:06:55.980
 at something, but you're born with a certain aptitude.

2:06:55.980 --> 2:06:57.720
 It might be to be a deal maker,

2:06:57.720 --> 2:06:58.860
 might be to be an athlete.

2:06:58.860 --> 2:06:59.940
 It might be to be an artist.

2:06:59.940 --> 2:07:01.660
 It might be to be a romantic,

2:07:01.660 --> 2:07:03.240
 just fall in and out of love, in and out of love,

2:07:03.240 --> 2:07:04.080
 in and out of love.

2:07:04.080 --> 2:07:05.420
 It might be to be like a world traveler.

2:07:05.420 --> 2:07:08.780
 Like, but whatever you are, I think you are.

2:07:08.780 --> 2:07:10.380
 I think that there's something about you

2:07:10.380 --> 2:07:11.980
 that makes you something.

2:07:11.980 --> 2:07:13.700
 And if you can figure it out and then refine,

2:07:13.700 --> 2:07:15.780
 you're not gonna be good at it per se.

2:07:15.780 --> 2:07:17.660
 But if you're an athlete,

2:07:17.660 --> 2:07:20.020
 it might not mean that you're going to be a great athlete

2:07:20.020 --> 2:07:22.020
 in the history, but it might mean you're the best coach

2:07:22.020 --> 2:07:24.580
 anyone's ever had, or you're the person that, you know,

2:07:24.580 --> 2:07:27.460
 builds a local scene for young athletes or whatever.

2:07:27.460 --> 2:07:30.100
 If you are a really good deal maker,

2:07:30.100 --> 2:07:31.460
 it doesn't mean you're gonna be Warren Buffett,

2:07:31.460 --> 2:07:33.920
 but it might mean you're somebody who enjoys

2:07:33.920 --> 2:07:36.520
 making deals all the time and things like that.

2:07:36.520 --> 2:07:38.220
 Like if you're an entertainer,

2:07:38.220 --> 2:07:40.900
 it might mean that you are an entertainer.

2:07:40.900 --> 2:07:43.220
 It might mean that you are in the world of entertainment

2:07:43.220 --> 2:07:46.820
 because you love it so much that if you lack the skillset

2:07:46.820 --> 2:07:49.060
 to really pursue it on a degree,

2:07:49.060 --> 2:07:51.820
 you just want to be like, there's a thing

2:07:51.820 --> 2:07:55.380
 inside of you that makes you what you are.

2:07:55.380 --> 2:07:56.980
 I think, I look at certain people and I go,

2:07:56.980 --> 2:07:59.220
 you were born to be that thing.

2:07:59.220 --> 2:08:00.060
 You know?

2:08:00.060 --> 2:08:01.260
 The whole purpose is to find it.

2:08:01.260 --> 2:08:03.980
 I was a juror on that murder trial in Long Island

2:08:03.980 --> 2:08:05.940
 and the woman who's the DA, I'm like,

2:08:05.940 --> 2:08:07.280
 you were born to do this.

2:08:07.280 --> 2:08:10.220
 You were born to put murderers away

2:08:10.220 --> 2:08:12.340
 and this guy killed the mother of his children.

2:08:12.340 --> 2:08:13.660
 I mean, he's a bad guy, but like, I was like,

2:08:13.660 --> 2:08:15.580
 you are really good at what you do.

2:08:15.580 --> 2:08:18.580
 She has a strong belief in whatever her moral code is

2:08:18.580 --> 2:08:20.500
 and what her justice and ethics are.

2:08:20.500 --> 2:08:22.100
 And she wants to communicate that to people.

2:08:22.100 --> 2:08:25.820
 She was very good at doing what she did.

2:08:25.820 --> 2:08:26.980
 I don't know the facts of the case.

2:08:26.980 --> 2:08:27.820
 I didn't really listen.

2:08:27.820 --> 2:08:29.640
 He seemed guilty, so I just voted guilty.

2:08:29.640 --> 2:08:31.900
 But I didn't really listen to her,

2:08:31.900 --> 2:08:34.260
 but I heard the shape of her mouth was very bovine,

2:08:34.260 --> 2:08:36.860
 like a cow, and it conferred a certain level

2:08:36.860 --> 2:08:39.100
 of expertise that I enjoyed.

2:08:39.100 --> 2:08:39.940
 Well, it's funny.

2:08:39.940 --> 2:08:42.980
 I mean, you could see, you're half joking.

2:08:42.980 --> 2:08:43.820
 Yes, but I'm serious.

2:08:43.820 --> 2:08:46.780
 You can often see that people just,

2:08:46.780 --> 2:08:47.860
 they found their place.

2:08:47.860 --> 2:08:48.820
 They found their role.

2:08:48.820 --> 2:08:49.700
 They found their thing.

2:08:49.700 --> 2:08:50.540
 They found their thing,

2:08:50.540 --> 2:08:52.060
 and that's kind of the purpose of life.

2:08:52.060 --> 2:08:55.780
 And once you are in a place that seems sticky,

2:08:55.780 --> 2:08:58.340
 like the place that seems right,

2:08:59.380 --> 2:09:01.140
 that's one of the problems with the generation

2:09:01.140 --> 2:09:03.380
 that you're speaking to, is there's always a feeling

2:09:03.380 --> 2:09:05.620
 like I should keep exploring, keep exploring.

2:09:05.620 --> 2:09:08.980
 But it's okay to stay in a place that you found that works.

2:09:08.980 --> 2:09:12.020
 Yeah, and listen, sometimes the best place you'll find

2:09:12.020 --> 2:09:13.940
 is like when people are like,

2:09:13.940 --> 2:09:15.900
 when did you feel really excited and alive?

2:09:15.900 --> 2:09:18.020
 It's like doing nothing.

2:09:18.020 --> 2:09:19.220
 Right, yeah.

2:09:19.220 --> 2:09:20.940
 You know, like that's the other thing.

2:09:20.940 --> 2:09:22.020
 It's like some people are gonna be like,

2:09:22.020 --> 2:09:23.540
 I feel really excited and alive,

2:09:23.540 --> 2:09:25.860
 and I'm laying in my backyard in a hammock.

2:09:25.860 --> 2:09:27.460
 And I just wanted the simplest life

2:09:27.460 --> 2:09:30.220
 and not have to do much, and I don't like doing anything.

2:09:30.220 --> 2:09:31.620
 And I love laying around and going,

2:09:31.620 --> 2:09:33.580
 wow, the sky looks good today.

2:09:33.580 --> 2:09:34.940
 Bill Gates goes, the sky looks good today.

2:09:34.940 --> 2:09:36.300
 Let's shoot a missile into it.

2:09:36.300 --> 2:09:37.540
 He wants to do shit, right?

2:09:37.540 --> 2:09:40.180
 So it's like in between that and nothing

2:09:40.180 --> 2:09:42.020
 is you can find something.

2:09:42.020 --> 2:09:45.620
 But in that process, for you personally,

2:09:45.620 --> 2:09:49.500
 I mean, for me and for others, I think there's a struggle.

2:09:49.500 --> 2:09:50.340
 When you look in the,

2:09:50.340 --> 2:09:52.140
 when Tim and Dylan looks in the mirror,

2:09:52.140 --> 2:09:54.820
 do you love yourself or do you hate yourself?

2:09:54.820 --> 2:09:56.740
 Well, a lot of times I think I'm Amy Schumer,

2:09:56.740 --> 2:09:58.060
 so I'm confused.

2:09:59.900 --> 2:10:01.860
 I'm a detente to myself all the time.

2:10:01.860 --> 2:10:03.100
 I don't love myself or hate myself.

2:10:03.100 --> 2:10:06.940
 Addicts have a very bad problem

2:10:06.940 --> 2:10:09.180
 where you can't just fall in love with yourself

2:10:09.180 --> 2:10:10.460
 and you can't hate yourself.

2:10:10.460 --> 2:10:12.700
 Both of them lead you to a negative place.

2:10:12.700 --> 2:10:14.780
 You try to stay kind of even keel.

2:10:14.780 --> 2:10:17.300
 I don't go like, hey man, you put out a video,

2:10:17.300 --> 2:10:18.740
 get all these views, things are great.

2:10:18.740 --> 2:10:19.820
 You sold a bunch of tickets.

2:10:19.820 --> 2:10:21.740
 Let's fucking go out and like, maybe let's,

2:10:21.740 --> 2:10:23.060
 hey man, let's have that drink

2:10:23.060 --> 2:10:24.980
 that you've been waiting for for 11 years.

2:10:24.980 --> 2:10:26.380
 And I don't look at myself and go,

2:10:26.380 --> 2:10:27.580
 you ate a burger yesterday.

2:10:27.580 --> 2:10:28.580
 You're a piece of shit.

2:10:28.580 --> 2:10:29.780
 You're horrible.

2:10:29.780 --> 2:10:33.260
 You'll never get into the shape you want.

2:10:33.260 --> 2:10:35.100
 I try not to get too low or too high.

2:10:35.100 --> 2:10:38.740
 Both of them are not good for my particular mind.

2:10:38.740 --> 2:10:42.900
 Okay, I gotta ask, we kind of spoke about 2021

2:10:42.900 --> 2:10:45.180
 and you being potentially hopeful,

2:10:45.180 --> 2:10:48.740
 hopeful short term, cynical long term.

2:10:48.740 --> 2:10:49.940
 Yeah.

2:10:49.940 --> 2:10:54.180
 So let me ask, I forgot to ask, are you moving to Austin?

2:10:54.180 --> 2:10:55.020
 I don't know.

2:10:55.020 --> 2:10:57.540
 I mean, I don't think so immediately.

2:10:57.540 --> 2:10:58.380
 I love Joe.

2:10:58.380 --> 2:10:59.820
 I love what he's trying to do down there.

2:10:59.820 --> 2:11:02.260
 I'm appreciative of everything that he's done

2:11:02.260 --> 2:11:04.660
 for not only me, but for comedy in general.

2:11:04.660 --> 2:11:06.580
 And I think as things happen in Austin

2:11:06.580 --> 2:11:08.580
 and unfold is such a political answer,

2:11:08.580 --> 2:11:11.340
 but as things unfold, I will consider it more and more.

2:11:11.340 --> 2:11:14.460
 But I mean, I think I got another year in LA.

2:11:14.460 --> 2:11:18.660
 So you've spoken so nicely about this magical place

2:11:18.660 --> 2:11:20.020
 that is Los Angeles.

2:11:20.020 --> 2:11:22.220
 LA is very funny.

2:11:22.220 --> 2:11:24.460
 You think there's a place for comedy in LA?

2:11:24.460 --> 2:11:25.860
 Oh yeah.

2:11:25.860 --> 2:11:27.380
 There will always be a place for comedy in LA.

2:11:27.380 --> 2:11:29.740
 So it's gonna be a place for comedy in New York.

2:11:29.740 --> 2:11:32.340
 I mean, the question is how thriving of a comedy scene

2:11:32.340 --> 2:11:33.620
 is Austin gonna be?

2:11:33.620 --> 2:11:36.820
 And Joe can probably make it one,

2:11:36.820 --> 2:11:38.620
 but as of right now, it isn't.

2:11:38.620 --> 2:11:39.980
 So that would be him doing that.

2:11:39.980 --> 2:11:42.300
 But the question, there's a lot of people escaping

2:11:42.300 --> 2:11:44.780
 Los Angeles, but I know better about New York.

2:11:44.780 --> 2:11:46.620
 There's a lot of really brilliant people.

2:11:46.620 --> 2:11:47.460
 Let them go.

2:11:47.460 --> 2:11:48.700
 There's other people.

2:11:48.700 --> 2:11:49.540
 This is the thing.

2:11:49.540 --> 2:11:50.700
 It's like, this is the fear thing.

2:11:50.700 --> 2:11:53.100
 It's like, no, but all the brilliant people are leaving.

2:11:53.100 --> 2:11:55.420
 There'll be other people and they'll fill their shoes

2:11:55.420 --> 2:11:57.700
 the way that they've done throughout history.

2:11:57.700 --> 2:11:59.540
 And I think that New York and LA,

2:11:59.540 --> 2:12:00.900
 listen, maybe in five to 10 years,

2:12:00.900 --> 2:12:02.380
 they're not the two cities.

2:12:02.380 --> 2:12:05.220
 It would be real rough in five years

2:12:05.220 --> 2:12:08.460
 when this pandemic's over for people in Australia to go,

2:12:08.460 --> 2:12:10.420
 dude, you gotta go to America

2:12:10.420 --> 2:12:13.220
 and you gotta visit Charleston and Austin.

2:12:13.220 --> 2:12:14.060
 Stop.

2:12:14.060 --> 2:12:15.180
 Let's be adults here.

2:12:15.180 --> 2:12:16.260
 Let's be adults.

2:12:16.260 --> 2:12:18.700
 It's still gonna be New York and LA for a while.

2:12:18.700 --> 2:12:21.940
 LA is an absolute hellscape,

2:12:21.940 --> 2:12:26.460
 but I don't think you're gonna replace California

2:12:26.460 --> 2:12:28.980
 with another place.

2:12:28.980 --> 2:12:30.660
 And also, everyone's making decisions now

2:12:30.660 --> 2:12:32.460
 because we're literally in the midst of a pandemic

2:12:32.460 --> 2:12:34.060
 we've never had before.

2:12:34.060 --> 2:12:35.500
 We've never had this before.

2:12:35.500 --> 2:12:37.940
 Joe loved California up until the pandemic.

2:12:37.940 --> 2:12:39.220
 He had problems with it.

2:12:39.220 --> 2:12:40.660
 Like, we all have problems with it.

2:12:40.660 --> 2:12:42.420
 There's a lot of benefits to being here.

2:12:42.420 --> 2:12:45.580
 I think a lot of us made pretty bad decisions in 2020

2:12:45.580 --> 2:12:46.860
 because we were all locked up

2:12:46.860 --> 2:12:48.940
 and stuck with our own thoughts.

2:12:48.940 --> 2:12:52.060
 But, so it's funny, there's parallels

2:12:52.060 --> 2:12:54.260
 because I don't necessarily,

2:12:54.260 --> 2:12:55.940
 you know, I'm obviously a fan of comedy,

2:12:55.940 --> 2:12:59.060
 but I don't care where comics move.

2:12:59.060 --> 2:13:01.300
 But there's a parallel move that's happening,

2:13:01.300 --> 2:13:04.380
 set of decisions which do influence my decision making,

2:13:04.380 --> 2:13:07.700
 which is where to start a business that's tech centered.

2:13:07.700 --> 2:13:12.180
 And that's more about the San Francisco, Silicon Valley.

2:13:12.180 --> 2:13:15.180
 And there is a lot of people leaving there.

2:13:15.180 --> 2:13:16.020
 That's already.

2:13:16.020 --> 2:13:16.860
 And they're going to Austin.

2:13:16.860 --> 2:13:19.900
 Well, Austin, there's a, I think,

2:13:19.900 --> 2:13:21.340
 there's a bunch of different places.

2:13:21.340 --> 2:13:23.380
 Phoenix, there's Denver.

2:13:23.380 --> 2:13:26.780
 Austin will probably be a massive tech hub.

2:13:26.780 --> 2:13:27.660
 Elon's there.

2:13:27.660 --> 2:13:30.700
 It seems like it's all, everything about Austin says

2:13:30.700 --> 2:13:33.220
 that it's going to be a massive tech hub.

2:13:33.220 --> 2:13:34.220
 I just don't know if that means

2:13:34.220 --> 2:13:35.580
 it'll be a massive comedy hub.

2:13:35.580 --> 2:13:36.420
 It might.

2:13:36.420 --> 2:13:38.420
 I don't know if those two can actually coexist.

2:13:38.420 --> 2:13:39.620
 It's interesting because.

2:13:39.620 --> 2:13:41.620
 Yeah, I don't, I think, you know,

2:13:41.620 --> 2:13:43.060
 comedy suffered in New York and LA

2:13:43.060 --> 2:13:45.380
 when everyone got super rich.

2:13:45.380 --> 2:13:47.100
 Like, you know, it just wasn't as cool.

2:13:47.100 --> 2:13:48.980
 It's still much more fun on the road.

2:13:48.980 --> 2:13:50.540
 It's still more fun to perform for people

2:13:50.540 --> 2:13:53.420
 that want and need to laugh in strip malls

2:13:53.420 --> 2:13:55.740
 than it is to perform for hedge fund managers

2:13:55.740 --> 2:13:59.220
 and with their dates and, you know, Instagram models in LA.

2:13:59.220 --> 2:14:00.060
 It's just what it is.

2:14:00.060 --> 2:14:01.700
 Comedy on the road is much more fun.

2:14:01.700 --> 2:14:04.380
 So maybe in the spirit of that, Austin becomes,

2:14:04.380 --> 2:14:06.940
 but you know, you know, if Austin is just colonized

2:14:06.940 --> 2:14:08.900
 by tech bros and stuff like, yeah, I mean,

2:14:08.900 --> 2:14:10.700
 sure, sure it'll be fun and it'll be great.

2:14:10.700 --> 2:14:13.740
 I think Joe's made LA a scene.

2:14:13.740 --> 2:14:16.380
 So if anyone's going to make Austin a scene, it's Joe.

2:14:17.660 --> 2:14:20.060
 Yeah, and I like the, on the Elon side,

2:14:20.060 --> 2:14:22.260
 which is what I'm much more familiar with,

2:14:22.260 --> 2:14:25.540
 the promise of the possibility of what that could become

2:14:25.540 --> 2:14:27.700
 because there's a lot of problems in Silicon Valley.

2:14:27.700 --> 2:14:30.380
 And of course it might be naive to think that

2:14:30.380 --> 2:14:33.060
 just because it's like the grass is greener thing,

2:14:33.060 --> 2:14:36.220
 which is just because the place where you come from

2:14:36.220 --> 2:14:37.420
 has a lot of problems,

2:14:37.420 --> 2:14:39.140
 doesn't mean you can just create a new place

2:14:39.140 --> 2:14:39.980
 that's not going to have those problems.

2:14:39.980 --> 2:14:41.580
 Yeah, there's homelessness in Austin.

2:14:41.580 --> 2:14:42.860
 There are problems in Austin.

2:14:42.860 --> 2:14:44.860
 I mean, I think that with, by the way,

2:14:44.860 --> 2:14:48.140
 with the influx of very rich people to an area,

2:14:48.140 --> 2:14:49.180
 sometimes that helps things,

2:14:49.180 --> 2:14:51.260
 but sometimes it just makes things more polarizing

2:14:51.260 --> 2:14:53.460
 and it puts a spotlight on those problems

2:14:53.460 --> 2:14:55.180
 and makes those problems even bigger, right?

2:14:55.180 --> 2:14:58.060
 So, I mean, I don't know that it's necessarily,

2:14:58.060 --> 2:14:59.180
 it's hard to predict.

2:14:59.180 --> 2:15:01.060
 I just know that LA right now is funny.

2:15:01.060 --> 2:15:03.020
 It's funny that there's 15 year old TikTokers

2:15:03.020 --> 2:15:05.260
 making millions of dollars dancing in a house

2:15:05.260 --> 2:15:06.420
 while the world burns.

2:15:06.420 --> 2:15:07.340
 That is very funny.

2:15:07.340 --> 2:15:11.140
 Well, it's for your style of humor, yes.

2:15:11.140 --> 2:15:13.220
 The absurdity of the world is that it's...

2:15:13.220 --> 2:15:15.380
 No one cares about Hollywood starlets

2:15:15.380 --> 2:15:16.900
 and actresses and actors and everyone goes,

2:15:16.900 --> 2:15:17.740
 hey, fuck you.

2:15:17.740 --> 2:15:19.580
 Even though they've won three Academy Awards,

2:15:19.580 --> 2:15:20.700
 they're all being replaced

2:15:20.700 --> 2:15:23.980
 by just mediocre dancer 15 year olds.

2:15:23.980 --> 2:15:25.500
 I mean, it's like there's something hilarious

2:15:25.500 --> 2:15:28.580
 about this city and it will burn in hell,

2:15:28.580 --> 2:15:29.660
 but so will everything.

2:15:29.660 --> 2:15:31.980
 So what are we talking about?

2:15:31.980 --> 2:15:34.620
 Eventually the sun will die out

2:15:34.620 --> 2:15:37.420
 and we will all be gone unless we colonize

2:15:37.420 --> 2:15:38.980
 outside of our solar system.

2:15:38.980 --> 2:15:42.900
 But I just sit here,

2:15:42.900 --> 2:15:43.900
 I'm struggling with this

2:15:43.900 --> 2:15:46.540
 because Boston, I'm currently at MIT,

2:15:46.540 --> 2:15:48.180
 Boston doesn't feel like the right place

2:15:48.180 --> 2:15:52.700
 to start a business in the tech sector.

2:15:52.700 --> 2:15:53.540
 And so I'm choosing,

2:15:53.540 --> 2:15:55.500
 I'm looking at San Francisco the way it is

2:15:55.500 --> 2:15:56.820
 and I'm looking at Austin.

2:15:56.820 --> 2:15:58.340
 Oh, Austin, clearly.

2:15:58.340 --> 2:16:02.900
 So it seems clear, but it's such a difficult thing

2:16:02.900 --> 2:16:07.500
 to predict what a place will look like in 10 years

2:16:07.500 --> 2:16:08.980
 and 15 years and 20 years.

2:16:08.980 --> 2:16:10.940
 And it's so hard to predict if you'll like it or not

2:16:10.940 --> 2:16:12.060
 until you're there.

2:16:12.060 --> 2:16:14.260
 And this is speaking to risk,

2:16:15.140 --> 2:16:18.180
 there's not really a good reason for me to move anywhere.

2:16:18.180 --> 2:16:21.180
 There's not a good reason to do anything in life.

2:16:21.180 --> 2:16:25.100
 Part of me wants to just fucking do it

2:16:25.100 --> 2:16:26.340
 and whatever and see what happens.

2:16:26.340 --> 2:16:28.380
 Do you like Boston, do you like other things about Boston

2:16:28.380 --> 2:16:30.780
 besides the tech thing?

2:16:30.780 --> 2:16:31.940
 You like MIT.

2:16:31.940 --> 2:16:33.260
 MIT, that's the problem.

2:16:33.260 --> 2:16:35.300
 Do you like the food in Boston?

2:16:35.300 --> 2:16:36.140
 Do you eat food?

2:16:36.140 --> 2:16:39.620
 I haven't eaten food or been outside for years.

2:16:39.620 --> 2:16:42.900
 And I mean, that's probably the better version.

2:16:42.900 --> 2:16:44.540
 But you're keto forever.

2:16:44.540 --> 2:16:45.940
 You've been keto for a long time.

2:16:45.940 --> 2:16:49.020
 Yeah, keto, fasting for a long time.

2:16:49.020 --> 2:16:54.020
 15 years fasting, eating once or twice a day.

2:16:54.020 --> 2:16:59.020
 But no sugar ever, no like and no pasta ever, no bread ever.

2:17:00.180 --> 2:17:05.180
 No pasta, no bread, no, except like, so my source of...

2:17:05.180 --> 2:17:06.420
 You could kind of live anywhere

2:17:06.420 --> 2:17:09.060
 because like going out is such a big part

2:17:09.060 --> 2:17:10.180
 of what city you live in.

2:17:10.180 --> 2:17:11.460
 And like, do you like the food there?

2:17:11.460 --> 2:17:12.300
 Do you like the restaurants?

2:17:12.300 --> 2:17:13.140
 Can you meet people?

2:17:13.140 --> 2:17:15.580
 Whatever, but it's like, you really can just kind of...

2:17:15.580 --> 2:17:17.420
 Yeah, so not married, no kids.

2:17:17.420 --> 2:17:18.340
 Right, you have freedom.

2:17:18.340 --> 2:17:19.460
 Me too, I have freedom.

2:17:20.580 --> 2:17:23.980
 And that's, we have the curse of being vegan.

2:17:23.980 --> 2:17:25.580
 We have too many choices.

2:17:25.580 --> 2:17:26.420
 Right.

2:17:26.420 --> 2:17:27.260
 That's the thing.

2:17:27.260 --> 2:17:28.100
 We have too many choices.

2:17:28.100 --> 2:17:29.620
 We don't have somebody else going, what about like,

2:17:29.620 --> 2:17:31.860
 we don't have to justify our decisions to anyone.

2:17:31.860 --> 2:17:34.540
 So we can just kind of like let our minds go run wild.

2:17:34.540 --> 2:17:37.500
 So you just got to hone the instinct

2:17:37.500 --> 2:17:40.940
 of just what feels right and just fucking do it.

2:17:40.940 --> 2:17:41.780
 And that's it.

2:17:41.780 --> 2:17:42.940
 I think Austin with Joe down there and Elon down there,

2:17:42.940 --> 2:17:46.460
 Austin seems like a real no brainer move for you.

2:17:46.460 --> 2:17:48.540
 To try, you know, why the hell not?

2:17:48.540 --> 2:17:49.620
 Why not?

2:17:49.620 --> 2:17:51.420
 And then I think I should go to MIT.

2:17:51.420 --> 2:17:56.420
 Like, I mean, I think I should give those nerds

2:17:56.940 --> 2:17:59.580
 a piece of my mind that you should go to.

2:17:59.580 --> 2:18:02.580
 I was in an Uber pool once with a kid from MIT

2:18:02.580 --> 2:18:05.100
 and I was eating this thing from Bova's Bakery.

2:18:05.100 --> 2:18:06.020
 I forget what it was.

2:18:06.020 --> 2:18:08.700
 It was like a, it's so good.

2:18:08.700 --> 2:18:09.540
 I don't know.

2:18:09.540 --> 2:18:10.660
 You don't know Bova's Bakery, right?

2:18:10.660 --> 2:18:12.260
 Yeah, it's in Boston, it's famous.

2:18:12.260 --> 2:18:14.220
 I was eating a thing and I was like covered in chocolate.

2:18:14.220 --> 2:18:16.140
 This kid, like this little nerd, like this little like,

2:18:16.140 --> 2:18:19.180
 you know, USB drive with feet was just staring at me

2:18:19.180 --> 2:18:21.180
 and they just dropped him off at MIT.

2:18:21.180 --> 2:18:22.740
 And he like scurried away.

2:18:22.740 --> 2:18:23.860
 But that's a big school that,

2:18:23.860 --> 2:18:25.740
 doesn't the NSA recruit out of their heavy,

2:18:25.740 --> 2:18:27.740
 like MIT, places like that?

2:18:27.740 --> 2:18:30.420
 I can't, I can't speak to that.

2:18:30.420 --> 2:18:34.540
 But what, this is a ridiculous question

2:18:34.540 --> 2:18:36.620
 I sometimes ask myself when I'm alone.

2:18:36.620 --> 2:18:38.740
 What is the meaning of life?

2:18:38.740 --> 2:18:41.820
 Do you think about the big existential kind of,

2:18:41.820 --> 2:18:43.180
 why the hell we're here?

2:18:43.180 --> 2:18:46.540
 It's a cosmic kind of joke kind of in a weird way, right?

2:18:46.540 --> 2:18:49.300
 I mean, Joe said it the other day on,

2:18:49.300 --> 2:18:51.500
 maybe it was you saying that like,

2:18:51.500 --> 2:18:52.580
 he was just like, you know,

2:18:52.580 --> 2:18:55.300
 by the time you figure out what it is, you're out of here.

2:18:55.300 --> 2:18:56.620
 You know, it's kind of interesting.

2:18:56.620 --> 2:18:58.300
 Or you even start to figure out what it is,

2:18:58.300 --> 2:18:59.140
 you're out of here.

2:18:59.140 --> 2:19:00.660
 It's like, that's kind of funny.

2:19:00.660 --> 2:19:04.700
 It's like, you don't get enough time to truly,

2:19:04.700 --> 2:19:06.740
 I think the meaning of life is just like,

2:19:08.100 --> 2:19:11.980
 at the end of the day, do you feel it was time well spent?

2:19:11.980 --> 2:19:13.220
 Was it time well spent?

2:19:14.100 --> 2:19:16.460
 That's really what it is.

2:19:16.460 --> 2:19:17.700
 If you look back, do you go,

2:19:17.700 --> 2:19:20.580
 hey, it was time well spent.

2:19:20.580 --> 2:19:21.420
 Pretty good ride.

2:19:21.420 --> 2:19:22.260
 It was a pretty good ride.

2:19:22.260 --> 2:19:25.580
 I did a lot of things.

2:19:27.020 --> 2:19:30.420
 Doing what you say is a part of it, I think.

2:19:30.420 --> 2:19:33.180
 If you say you're going to do something, maybe doing it.

2:19:34.180 --> 2:19:38.060
 That seems to be extrapolating the meaning of life question

2:19:38.060 --> 2:19:40.940
 to like, you know, what did you come here to do?

2:19:40.940 --> 2:19:43.100
 I think it goes down deep of like, who are you

2:19:43.100 --> 2:19:44.980
 and what do you want and you know,

2:19:44.980 --> 2:19:47.060
 what are you suited to do and what?

2:19:47.060 --> 2:19:51.260
 It does seem that like, the people who are most enlightened

2:19:51.260 --> 2:19:54.340
 that I've ever met or read books by,

2:19:54.340 --> 2:19:56.300
 they ultimately land on humor.

2:19:56.300 --> 2:19:58.380
 Like, they don't take shit seriously.

2:19:58.380 --> 2:20:01.060
 They embrace the absurdity of it all

2:20:01.060 --> 2:20:04.780
 and just kind of laugh at it in this kind of simple way.

2:20:04.780 --> 2:20:08.260
 So it does seem that humor is like,

2:20:08.260 --> 2:20:12.340
 one of the fundamental truths of this universe we're in.

2:20:12.340 --> 2:20:13.180
 And somehow.

2:20:13.180 --> 2:20:14.420
 It's love, it's love.

2:20:14.420 --> 2:20:16.860
 Humor can be love, right?

2:20:16.860 --> 2:20:20.500
 People laughing, that that sound is kind of like,

2:20:20.500 --> 2:20:22.260
 Carolyn Knapp, who wrote a book called,

2:20:22.260 --> 2:20:25.780
 Drinking a Love Story, which is a really good book

2:20:25.780 --> 2:20:27.820
 about not drinking.

2:20:27.820 --> 2:20:29.500
 Drinking and then not drinking.

2:20:29.500 --> 2:20:34.460
 And she said, you could understand things as love.

2:20:34.460 --> 2:20:36.780
 I think one of the last lines of the thing is like,

2:20:36.780 --> 2:20:39.460
 people talking about their experiences in life,

2:20:39.460 --> 2:20:40.320
 that could be love.

2:20:40.320 --> 2:20:41.740
 Like, you know, laughter is love.

2:20:41.740 --> 2:20:43.960
 Like, I feel like love and finding it

2:20:43.960 --> 2:20:46.380
 wherever you could find it is why we're here.

2:20:46.380 --> 2:20:47.980
 That's that connection.

2:20:47.980 --> 2:20:49.660
 And laughter can be love.

2:20:49.660 --> 2:20:53.200
 And, you know, figuring out, you know,

2:20:53.200 --> 2:20:56.100
 something that makes life better

2:20:56.100 --> 2:20:57.860
 for a lot of people can be love.

2:20:57.860 --> 2:20:59.260
 You know, whether it's a vaccine

2:20:59.260 --> 2:21:02.180
 or a technological advancement or whatever.

2:21:02.180 --> 2:21:04.380
 Like, you know, all of those things,

2:21:04.380 --> 2:21:06.380
 I think, can be that feeling.

2:21:06.380 --> 2:21:07.980
 And I think that's what's important.

2:21:07.980 --> 2:21:11.380
 It connects you to a larger frequency, you know?

2:21:11.380 --> 2:21:13.460
 I don't think there's a better way to end it, Tim.

2:21:13.460 --> 2:21:15.740
 I hope you're one of the voices.

2:21:15.740 --> 2:21:17.580
 I truly believe that your legacy

2:21:17.580 --> 2:21:20.000
 would be one of the most important voices of our time,

2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:22.900
 because you're fearless and challenging all the absurdity

2:21:22.900 --> 2:21:27.900
 of the nonsense of our social and political discourse.

2:21:28.500 --> 2:21:30.180
 So I hope you keep doing it.

2:21:30.180 --> 2:21:31.000
 I'm a fan.

2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:33.140
 I'm still a bit starstruck, so.

2:21:33.140 --> 2:21:33.980
 I'll stop it.

2:21:33.980 --> 2:21:38.420
 Listen, I was your intellectual capacity.

2:21:38.420 --> 2:21:41.420
 Enjoying anything I do only underscores

2:21:41.420 --> 2:21:43.120
 how truly fucked we are.

2:21:43.120 --> 2:21:46.860
 But thank you very much.

2:21:46.860 --> 2:21:49.220
 Yeah, thank you for talking today.

 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
