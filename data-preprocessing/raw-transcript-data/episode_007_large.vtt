00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
 The following is a conversation with Jeff Atwood.

00:02.400 --> 00:05.840
 He is the cofounder of Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange,

00:05.840 --> 00:08.280
 websites that are visited by millions of people

00:08.280 --> 00:09.560
 every single day.

00:09.560 --> 00:13.880
 Much like with Wikipedia, it is difficult to understate

00:13.880 --> 00:16.680
 the impact on global knowledge and productivity

00:16.680 --> 00:19.520
 that these networks of sites have created.

00:19.520 --> 00:24.000
 Jeff is also the author of the famed blog Coding Horror

00:24.000 --> 00:27.160
 and the founder of Discourse, an open source software

00:27.160 --> 00:31.160
 project that seeks to improve the quality of our online

00:31.160 --> 00:33.440
 community discussions.

00:33.440 --> 00:36.640
 This conversation is part of the MIT course

00:36.640 --> 00:38.480
 on artificial general intelligence

00:38.480 --> 00:40.840
 and the artificial intelligence podcast.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.720
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes,

00:43.720 --> 00:45.620
 or your podcast provider of choice,

00:45.620 --> 00:48.720
 or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman,

00:48.720 --> 00:51.000
 spelled F R I D.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.200
 And now, here's my conversation with Jeff Atwood.

00:56.200 --> 00:59.120
 Having co created and managed for a few years

00:59.120 --> 01:02.960
 the world's largest community of programmers in Stack Overflow

01:02.960 --> 01:08.600
 10 years ago, what do you think motivates most programmers?

01:08.600 --> 01:13.320
 Is it fame, fortune, glory, process of programming itself,

01:13.320 --> 01:16.440
 or is it the sense of belonging to a community?

01:16.440 --> 01:17.960
 It's puzzles, really.

01:17.960 --> 01:22.320
 I think it's this idea of working on puzzles

01:22.320 --> 01:25.800
 independently of other people and just solving a problem,

01:25.800 --> 01:28.360
 sort of like on your own almost.

01:28.360 --> 01:32.280
 Although, nobody really works alone in programming anymore.

01:32.280 --> 01:36.480
 But I will say there's an aspect of hiding yourself away

01:36.480 --> 01:39.560
 and just beating on a problem until you solve it,

01:39.560 --> 01:41.120
 like brute force basically to me is

01:41.120 --> 01:43.000
 what a lot of programming is.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.560
 The computer's so fast that you can

01:44.560 --> 01:46.560
 do things that would take forever for a human,

01:46.560 --> 01:49.200
 but you can just do them so many times and so often

01:49.200 --> 01:52.040
 that you get the answer.

01:52.040 --> 01:55.520
 You're saying just the pure act of tinkering with the code

01:55.520 --> 01:58.680
 is the thing that drives most problems.

01:58.680 --> 02:03.000
 The struggle balance within the joy of overcoming,

02:03.000 --> 02:05.960
 the brute force process of pain and suffering

02:05.960 --> 02:09.240
 that eventually leads to something that actually works.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.200
 Well, data's fun, too.

02:10.200 --> 02:12.360
 There's this thing called the shuffling problem.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.960
 The naive shuffle that most programmers write

02:14.960 --> 02:16.920
 has a huge flaw, and there's a lot of articles

02:16.920 --> 02:18.920
 online about this because it can be really bad

02:18.920 --> 02:22.040
 if you're a casino and you have an unsophisticated programmer

02:22.040 --> 02:23.480
 writing your shuffle algorithm.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.240
 There's surprising ways to get this wrong,

02:25.240 --> 02:27.240
 but the neat thing is the way to figure that out

02:27.240 --> 02:29.040
 is just to run your shuffle a bunch of times

02:29.040 --> 02:32.200
 and see how many orientations of cards you get.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.680
 You should get an equal distribution of all the cards.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.360
 And with the naive method of shuffling,

02:36.360 --> 02:38.560
 if you just look at the data, if you just brute force it

02:38.560 --> 02:40.880
 and say, OK, I don't know what's going to happen,

02:40.880 --> 02:43.320
 you just write a program that does it a billion times

02:43.320 --> 02:46.040
 and then see what the buckets look like of the data.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.200
 And the Monty Hall problem is another example of that,

02:48.200 --> 02:50.600
 where you have three doors and somebody gives you

02:50.600 --> 02:52.680
 information about another door.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.480
 So the correct answer is you should always

02:54.480 --> 02:56.400
 switch in the Monty Hall problem, which is not intuitive,

02:56.400 --> 02:58.040
 and it freaks people out all the time.

02:58.040 --> 02:59.760
 But you can solve it with data.

02:59.760 --> 03:04.360
 If you write a program that does the Monty Hall game

03:04.360 --> 03:06.840
 and then never switches, then always switches, just compare,

03:06.840 --> 03:09.640
 you would immediately see that you don't have to be smart.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.560
 You don't have to figure out the answer algorithmically.

03:11.560 --> 03:13.360
 You can just brute force it out with data and say, well,

03:13.360 --> 03:15.440
 I know the answer is this because I ran the program

03:15.440 --> 03:17.440
 a billion times, and these are the data buckets

03:17.440 --> 03:18.920
 that I got from it.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.280
 So empirically find it.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.280
 But what's the joy of that?

03:22.280 --> 03:26.320
 So for you, for you personally, outside of family,

03:26.320 --> 03:29.400
 what motivates you in this process?

03:29.400 --> 03:30.960
 Well, to be honest, I don't really

03:30.960 --> 03:32.520
 write a lot of code anymore.

03:32.520 --> 03:35.040
 What I do at Discourse is managery stuff,

03:35.040 --> 03:37.800
 which I always despised.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.200
 As a programmer, you think of managers

03:39.200 --> 03:42.320
 as people who don't really do anything themselves.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.960
 But the weird thing about code is you

03:43.960 --> 03:45.880
 realize that language is code.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.280
 The ability to direct other people

03:48.280 --> 03:50.560
 lets you get more stuff done than you

03:50.560 --> 03:52.240
 could by yourself anyway.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.600
 You said language is code?

03:53.600 --> 03:54.360
 Language is code.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.040
 Meaning communication with other humans?

03:56.040 --> 03:56.840
 Yes, it is.

03:56.840 --> 03:58.480
 You can think of it as a systematic.

03:58.480 --> 04:01.760
 So what is it like to be, what makes,

04:01.760 --> 04:04.280
 before we get into programming, what makes a good manager?

04:04.280 --> 04:05.800
 What makes a good leader?

04:05.800 --> 04:08.280
 Well, I think a leader, it's all about leading by example,

04:08.280 --> 04:11.400
 first of all, sort of doing and being the things

04:11.400 --> 04:12.440
 that you want to be.

04:12.440 --> 04:13.600
 Now, this can be kind of exhausting,

04:13.600 --> 04:14.760
 particularly when you have kids, because you

04:14.760 --> 04:17.760
 realize that your kids are watching you all the time,

04:17.760 --> 04:20.720
 even in ways that you've stopped seeing yourself.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.560
 The hardest person to see on the planet is really yourself.

04:23.560 --> 04:24.560
 It's a lot easier to see other people

04:24.560 --> 04:26.240
 and make judgments about them.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.360
 But yourself, you're super biased.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.840
 You don't actually see yourself the way other people see you.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.000
 Often, you're very, very hard on yourself in a way

04:33.000 --> 04:34.760
 that other people really aren't going to be.

04:34.760 --> 04:37.880
 So that's one of the insights is you've

04:37.880 --> 04:40.200
 got to be really diligent about thinking,

04:40.200 --> 04:42.360
 am I behaving in a way that represents

04:42.360 --> 04:44.720
 how I want other people to behave,

04:44.720 --> 04:46.120
 like leading through example?

04:46.120 --> 04:47.960
 There's a lot of examples of leaders

04:47.960 --> 04:50.280
 that really mess this up, like they make decisions that

04:50.280 --> 04:54.960
 are like, wow, it's a bad example for other people.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.440
 So I think leading by example is one.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.640
 The other one I believe is working really hard.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.520
 And I don't mean working exhaustively,

05:01.520 --> 05:07.200
 but showing a real passion for the problem,

05:07.200 --> 05:09.000
 not necessarily your solution to the problem,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.040
 but the problem itself is just one that you really believe in.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.480
 Like with discourse, for example,

05:12.480 --> 05:13.960
 the problem that we're looking at,

05:13.960 --> 05:17.360
 which is my current project, is how do you get people

05:17.360 --> 05:20.040
 in groups to communicate in a way that doesn't break down

05:20.040 --> 05:21.920
 into the howling of wolves?

05:21.920 --> 05:23.600
 How do you deal with trolling?

05:23.600 --> 05:24.920
 Not like technical problems.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.440
 How do I get people to post paragraphs?

05:26.440 --> 05:27.480
 How do I get people to use bold?

05:27.480 --> 05:29.480
 How do I get people to use complete sentences,

05:29.480 --> 05:30.840
 although those are problems as well?

05:30.840 --> 05:33.560
 But how do I get people to get along with each other

05:33.560 --> 05:36.120
 and then solve whatever problem it is they set out to solve,

05:36.120 --> 05:38.280
 or reach some consensus on discussion,

05:38.280 --> 05:39.920
 or just not hurt each other even?

05:39.920 --> 05:41.920
 Maybe it's a discussion that doesn't really matter,

05:41.920 --> 05:43.560
 but are people yelling at each other?

05:43.560 --> 05:44.400
 And why?

05:44.400 --> 05:46.720
 Like that's not the purpose of this kind of communication.

05:46.720 --> 05:51.720
 So I would say leadership is about setting an example,

05:52.960 --> 05:54.880
 doing the things that represent what you want to be,

05:54.880 --> 05:56.760
 and making sure that you're actually doing those things.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.120
 And there's a trick to that too,

05:58.120 --> 05:59.720
 because the things you don't do

05:59.720 --> 06:01.520
 also say a lot about what you are.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.960
 Yeah, so let's pause on that one.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.160
 So those two things are fascinating.

06:05.160 --> 06:08.080
 So how do you have as a leader that self awareness?

06:08.080 --> 06:10.200
 So you just said it's really hard to be self aware.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.880
 So for you personally, or maybe for other leaders

06:12.880 --> 06:14.160
 you've seen or look up to,

06:14.160 --> 06:18.600
 how do you know both that the things you're doing

06:18.600 --> 06:20.000
 are the wrong things to be doing,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.280
 the way you speak to others, the way you behave,

06:22.280 --> 06:23.600
 and the things you're not doing?

06:23.600 --> 06:24.440
 How do you get that signal?

06:24.440 --> 06:26.360
 I think there's two aspects to that.

06:26.360 --> 06:29.400
 One is like processing feedback that you're getting, so.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.240
 How do you get feedback?

06:30.240 --> 06:32.280
 Well, right, so are you getting feedback, right?

06:32.280 --> 06:33.640
 So one way we do it, for example, with discourse,

06:33.640 --> 06:34.800
 we have three cofounders,

06:34.800 --> 06:37.280
 and we periodically talk about decisions

06:37.280 --> 06:38.120
 before we make them.

06:38.120 --> 06:40.720
 So it's not like one person can make a mistake,

06:40.720 --> 06:43.160
 or like, wow, there can be misunderstandings, things like that.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.520
 So it's part of like group consensus of leadership

06:45.520 --> 06:47.000
 is like it's good to have,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.320
 I think systems where there's one leader,

06:49.320 --> 06:50.920
 and that leader has the rule of absolute law

06:50.920 --> 06:53.480
 are just really dangerous in my experience.

06:53.480 --> 06:54.560
 For communities, for example,

06:54.560 --> 06:56.120
 like if you have a community that's run by one person,

06:56.120 --> 06:57.480
 that one person makes all the decisions,

06:57.480 --> 06:59.320
 that person's gonna have a bad day.

06:59.320 --> 07:02.480
 Something could happen to that person, something,

07:02.480 --> 07:03.320
 there's a lot of variables.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.240
 So like first, when you think about leadership,

07:05.240 --> 07:07.000
 have multiple people doing leadership

07:07.000 --> 07:08.880
 and have them talk amongst each other.

07:08.880 --> 07:11.320
 So giving each other feedback about the decisions

07:11.320 --> 07:12.160
 that they're making.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.640
 And then when you do get feedback,

07:13.640 --> 07:16.240
 I think there's that little voice in your head, right?

07:16.240 --> 07:19.040
 Or your gut or wherever you wanna put it in your body.

07:19.040 --> 07:22.320
 I think that voice is really important.

07:22.320 --> 07:25.120
 Like I think most people who have any kind of moral compass

07:25.120 --> 07:25.960
 or like want to do,

07:25.960 --> 07:27.280
 most people want to do the right thing.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.360
 I do believe that.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.640
 I mean, there might be a handful of sociopaths

07:30.640 --> 07:32.520
 out there that don't, but most people,

07:32.520 --> 07:34.640
 they want other people to think of them as a good person.

07:34.640 --> 07:35.560
 And why wouldn't you, right?

07:35.560 --> 07:36.800
 Like, do you want people to despise you?

07:36.800 --> 07:38.040
 I mean, that's just weird, right?

07:38.040 --> 07:39.160
 So you have that little voice

07:39.160 --> 07:40.960
 that sort of the angel and devil on your shoulder

07:40.960 --> 07:43.000
 sort of talking to you about like what you're doing,

07:43.000 --> 07:44.520
 how you're doing, how does it make you feel

07:44.520 --> 07:46.240
 to make these decisions, right?

07:46.240 --> 07:49.200
 And I think having some attunement to that voice

07:49.200 --> 07:50.160
 is important.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.280
 But you said that voice also for,

07:52.280 --> 07:55.080
 I think this is a programmer situation too,

07:55.080 --> 07:57.080
 where sometimes the devil on the shoulder

07:57.080 --> 07:59.680
 is a little too loud.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.000
 So you're a little too self critical

08:02.000 --> 08:03.320
 for a lot of developers,

08:03.320 --> 08:05.520
 and especially when you have introverted personality.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.520
 How do you struggle with a self criticism

08:07.520 --> 08:09.720
 or the criticism of others?

08:09.720 --> 08:11.720
 So one of the things of leadership

08:11.720 --> 08:14.360
 is to do something that's potentially unpopular

08:14.360 --> 08:15.720
 or where people doubt you

08:15.720 --> 08:18.200
 and you still go through with the decision.

08:18.200 --> 08:21.040
 So what's that balance like?

08:21.040 --> 08:22.080
 I think you have to walk people

08:22.080 --> 08:23.160
 through your decision making, right?

08:23.160 --> 08:24.360
 Like you have to, this is where blogging

08:24.360 --> 08:26.000
 is really important and communication is so important.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.800
 Again, code language is just another kind of code.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.600
 It's like, here is the program

08:29.600 --> 08:31.640
 by which I arrived at the conclusion

08:31.640 --> 08:33.200
 that I'm gonna reach, right?

08:33.200 --> 08:34.040
 It's one thing to say like,

08:34.040 --> 08:36.680
 this is a decision, it's final, deal with it, right?

08:36.680 --> 08:38.720
 That's not usually satisfying to people.

08:38.720 --> 08:39.920
 But if you say, look,

08:39.920 --> 08:41.240
 we've been thinking about this problem for a while.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.480
 Here's some stuff that's happened.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.880
 Here's what we think is right.

08:43.880 --> 08:44.800
 Here's our goals.

08:44.800 --> 08:45.840
 Here's what we wanna achieve.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.760
 And we've looked at these options

08:47.760 --> 08:50.440
 and we think this available options is the best option.

08:50.440 --> 08:52.000
 People will be like, oh, okay, right?

08:52.000 --> 08:52.960
 Maybe I don't totally agree with you,

08:52.960 --> 08:54.240
 but I can kind of see where you're coming from

08:54.240 --> 08:56.760
 and I see it's not just arbitrary decision

08:56.760 --> 09:00.160
 delivered from a cloud of flames in the sky, right?

09:00.160 --> 09:02.280
 It's like a human trying to reach

09:02.280 --> 09:04.240
 some kind of consensus about goals.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.640
 And their goals might be different than yours.

09:05.640 --> 09:06.680
 That's completely legit, right?

09:06.680 --> 09:08.760
 But if you're making that clear, it's like,

09:08.760 --> 09:09.880
 oh, well, the reason we don't agree

09:09.880 --> 09:11.600
 is because we have totally different goals, right?

09:11.600 --> 09:12.840
 Like, how could we agree?

09:12.840 --> 09:14.040
 It's not that you're a bad person.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.640
 It's that we have radically different goals in mind

09:16.640 --> 09:18.040
 when we started looking at this problem.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.640
 And the other one you said is passion.

09:19.640 --> 09:22.280
 So, or hard work, sorry.

09:22.280 --> 09:24.040
 Well, those are tied together in my mind.

09:24.040 --> 09:24.960
 Let's say hard work and passion.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.680
 Like for me, like I just really love

09:26.680 --> 09:28.280
 the problem discourse is setting out to solve

09:28.280 --> 09:30.520
 because in a way it's like,

09:30.520 --> 09:32.080
 there's a vision of the world

09:32.080 --> 09:33.600
 where it all devolves into Facebook

09:33.600 --> 09:35.920
 basically owning everything and every aspect

09:35.920 --> 09:37.000
 of human communication, right?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.880
 And this has always been kind of a scary world for me.

09:39.880 --> 09:40.800
 First, cause I don't,

09:40.800 --> 09:42.360
 I think Facebook is really good at execution.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.200
 I got to compliment them.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.360
 They're very competent in terms of what they're doing,

09:45.360 --> 09:48.120
 but Facebook has not much of a moral compass

09:48.120 --> 09:50.960
 in terms of Facebook cares about Facebook, really.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.480
 They don't really care about you and your problems.

09:53.480 --> 09:56.120
 What they care about is how big they can make Facebook,

09:56.120 --> 09:56.960
 right?

09:56.960 --> 09:57.800
 Is that you talking about the company

09:57.800 --> 09:59.880
 or just the mechanism of how Facebook works?

09:59.880 --> 10:01.000
 Kind of both really, right?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.680
 Like, and the idea with discourse,

10:02.680 --> 10:03.840
 the reason I'm so passionate about it

10:03.840 --> 10:05.320
 is cause I believe every community

10:05.320 --> 10:07.000
 should have the right to own themselves, right?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.560
 Like they should have their own software that they can run

10:09.560 --> 10:10.960
 that belongs to them.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.840
 That's their space where they can set the rules.

10:12.840 --> 10:13.680
 And if they don't like it,

10:13.680 --> 10:15.320
 they can move to different hosting or,

10:15.320 --> 10:18.040
 you know, whatever they need to happen can happen.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.560
 But like this idea of a company town

10:20.560 --> 10:22.640
 where all human communication is implicitly owned

10:22.640 --> 10:25.240
 by WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.160
 And it's really disturbing too,

10:26.160 --> 10:27.720
 cause Facebook is really smart.

10:27.720 --> 10:28.880
 Like I said, they're great at execution.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.600
 Buying in WhatsApp and buying Instagram

10:30.600 --> 10:33.160
 were incredibly smart decisions.

10:33.160 --> 10:34.720
 And they also do this thing, I don't know if you know,

10:34.720 --> 10:36.240
 but they have this VPN software

10:36.240 --> 10:38.760
 that they give away for free on smartphones

10:38.760 --> 10:40.960
 and it indirectly feeds all the data

10:40.960 --> 10:42.760
 about the traffic back to Facebook.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.560
 So they can see what's actually getting popular

10:44.560 --> 10:45.880
 through the VPNs, right?

10:45.880 --> 10:48.320
 They have low level access to the network data

10:48.320 --> 10:50.360
 because users have let them have that.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.360
 So.

10:51.360 --> 10:54.040
 So let's take a small pause here.

10:54.040 --> 10:55.280
 First of all, discourse.

10:55.280 --> 10:59.000
 Can you talk about, can you lay out the land

10:59.000 --> 11:01.800
 of all the different ways you can have communities?

11:01.800 --> 11:03.760
 So there's Stack Overflow that you've built.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.200
 There's discourse.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.200
 So Stack Overflow is kind of like a Wiki,

11:07.200 --> 11:09.120
 Wikipedia you talk about.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.880
 And it's a very specific scalpel, very focused.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.440
 So what is the purpose of discourse

11:13.440 --> 11:16.000
 and maybe contrast that with Facebook?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.960
 First of all, say, what is discourse?

11:17.960 --> 11:18.800
 Yeah.

11:18.800 --> 11:19.640
 Start from the beginning.

11:19.640 --> 11:20.480
 Well, let me start from the very beginning.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.920
 So Stack Overflow is a very structured

11:21.920 --> 11:24.600
 Wiki style Q and A for programmers, right?

11:24.600 --> 11:26.680
 And that was the problem we first worked on.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.840
 And when we started, we thought it was discussions

11:28.840 --> 11:30.760
 because we looked at like programming forums

11:30.760 --> 11:32.640
 and other things, but we quickly realized

11:32.640 --> 11:35.400
 we were doing Q and A, which is a very narrow subset

11:35.400 --> 11:36.880
 of human communication, right?

11:36.880 --> 11:38.760
 Sorry, so when you started Stack Overflow,

11:38.760 --> 11:41.760
 you thought you didn't even know the Q and A.

11:41.760 --> 11:42.600
 Not really.

11:42.600 --> 11:43.440
 You didn't know it would be Q and A.

11:43.440 --> 11:44.280
 Well, we didn't know.

11:44.280 --> 11:45.720
 We had an idea of like, okay, these are things

11:45.720 --> 11:46.840
 that we see working online.

11:46.840 --> 11:47.680
 We had a goal, right?

11:47.680 --> 11:50.960
 Our goal was there was this site, Experts Exchange,

11:50.960 --> 11:52.560
 with a very unfortunate name.

11:52.560 --> 11:53.800
 Thank you for killing that site.

11:53.800 --> 11:54.680
 Yeah, I know, right?

11:54.680 --> 11:56.400
 Like a lot of people don't remember it anymore,

11:56.400 --> 11:57.240
 which is great.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.080
 Like that's the measure of success

11:58.080 --> 11:59.280
 when people don't remember the thing

11:59.280 --> 12:02.600
 that you were trying to replace, then you've totally won.

12:02.600 --> 12:05.600
 So it was a place to get answers to programming questions,

12:05.600 --> 12:07.440
 but it wasn't clear if it was like focused Q and A,

12:07.440 --> 12:08.760
 if it was a discussion.

12:08.760 --> 12:10.320
 There were plenty of programming forums.

12:10.320 --> 12:11.320
 So we weren't really sure.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.440
 We were like, okay, we'll take aspects of dig and Reddit,

12:13.440 --> 12:15.720
 like voting were very important.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.400
 Reordering answers based on votes.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.560
 Wiki style stuff of like being able to edit posts,

12:19.560 --> 12:21.240
 not just your posts, but other people's posts

12:21.240 --> 12:23.840
 to make them better and keep them more up to date.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.160
 Ownership of blogging of like, okay, this is me.

12:26.160 --> 12:29.800
 I'm saying this in my voice, this is the stuff that I know.

12:29.800 --> 12:33.360
 And your reputation accrues to you

12:33.360 --> 12:34.880
 and it's peer recognition.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.040
 So you asked earlier, like what motivates programmers?

12:37.040 --> 12:40.040
 I think peer recognition motivates them a lot.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.840
 That was one of the key insights of Stack Overflow

12:41.840 --> 12:44.960
 was like recognition from your peers is why things get done.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.400
 Not necessarily money, not necessarily your boss,

12:46.400 --> 12:47.840
 but like your peers saying, wow,

12:47.840 --> 12:50.360
 this person really knows their stuff, has a lot of value.

12:50.360 --> 12:53.280
 So the reputation system came from that.

12:53.280 --> 12:56.320
 So we were sort of Frankensteining a bunch of stuff together

12:56.320 --> 12:58.680
 in Stack Overflow, like stuff we had seen working

12:58.680 --> 13:03.680
 and we knew worked and that became Stack Overflow.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.520
 Over time, we realized it wasn't really discussion.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.760
 It was very focused questions and answers.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.040
 There wasn't a lot of room on the page

13:10.040 --> 13:12.520
 for let me talk about this tangential thing.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.760
 It was more like, okay, is it answering the question?

13:14.760 --> 13:16.160
 Is it clarifying the question?

13:16.160 --> 13:18.720
 Or could it be an alternative answer to the same question?

13:18.720 --> 13:20.560
 Because there's usually more than one way to do it

13:20.560 --> 13:22.640
 in programming, there's like say five to 10 ways.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.400
 And one of the patterns we got into early on

13:24.400 --> 13:26.440
 with Stack Overflow was there were questions

13:26.440 --> 13:28.440
 where there would be like hundreds of answers.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.800
 And we're like, wow, how can there be a programming question

13:31.800 --> 13:34.720
 with 500, 200, 500 answers?

13:34.720 --> 13:36.160
 And we looked at those and we realized

13:36.160 --> 13:38.840
 those were not really questions in the traditional sense.

13:38.840 --> 13:39.800
 They were discussions.

13:39.800 --> 13:42.280
 It was stuff that we allowed early on

13:42.280 --> 13:44.640
 that we eventually decided wasn't allowed such as

13:44.640 --> 13:46.760
 what's your favorite programming food?

13:46.760 --> 13:49.560
 What's the funniest programming cartoon you've seen?

13:49.560 --> 13:51.320
 And we had to sort of backfill a bunch of rules

13:51.320 --> 13:53.080
 about like, why isn't this allowed?

13:53.080 --> 13:55.160
 Such as, is this a real problem you're facing?

13:55.160 --> 13:57.200
 Like nobody goes to work and says, wow, I can't work

13:57.200 --> 13:59.080
 cause I don't know what the funniest programming cartoon is.

13:59.080 --> 14:02.040
 So sorry, can't compile this code now, right?

14:02.040 --> 14:04.600
 It's not a real problem you're facing in your job.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.440
 So that was run rule.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.320
 And the second, like, what can you really learn from that?

14:07.320 --> 14:08.760
 It's like what I call accidental learning

14:08.760 --> 14:10.200
 or Reddit style learning.

14:10.200 --> 14:11.640
 Where you're just like, oh, I'll just browse some things

14:11.640 --> 14:13.360
 and oh, wow, you know, did you know

14:13.360 --> 14:14.960
 tree frogs only live three years?

14:14.960 --> 14:16.000
 I mean, I just made that up.

14:16.000 --> 14:16.920
 I don't know if that's true.

14:16.920 --> 14:18.920
 But I didn't really set out to learn that.

14:18.920 --> 14:20.280
 I don't need to know that, right?

14:20.280 --> 14:21.760
 It's accidental learning.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.840
 It was more intentional learning where you're like,

14:23.840 --> 14:24.660
 okay, I have a problem.

14:24.660 --> 14:25.500
 And I want to learn about stuff

14:25.500 --> 14:27.160
 around this problem having, right?

14:27.160 --> 14:29.160
 And it could be theory, it could be compiler theory,

14:29.160 --> 14:31.840
 it could be other stuff, but I'm having a compiler problem.

14:31.840 --> 14:34.320
 Hence, I need to know the compiler theory,

14:34.320 --> 14:38.160
 that aspect of it that gets me to my answer, right?

14:38.160 --> 14:39.400
 So kind of a directed learning.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.960
 So we had to backfill all these rules

14:40.960 --> 14:43.680
 as we sort of figured out what the heck it was we were doing.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.420
 And the system came very strict over time.

14:45.420 --> 14:46.880
 And a lot of people still complain about that.

14:46.880 --> 14:49.040
 And I wrote my latest blog entry,

14:49.040 --> 14:52.360
 what does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?

14:52.360 --> 14:54.200
 Celebrating the 10 year anniversary, yeah.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.240
 Yeah, so 10 years.

14:55.240 --> 14:57.680
 And the system has trended towards strictness.

14:57.680 --> 14:58.900
 There's a variety of reasons for this.

14:58.900 --> 15:01.320
 One is people don't like to see other people

15:01.320 --> 15:03.960
 get reputation for stuff as they view as frivolous,

15:03.960 --> 15:05.080
 which I can actually understand.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.880
 Because if you saw a programmer got like 500 upvotes

15:07.880 --> 15:10.360
 for funniest programming cartoon

15:10.360 --> 15:11.800
 or funniest comment they had seen in code,

15:11.800 --> 15:13.820
 it's like, well, why do they have that reputation?

15:13.820 --> 15:15.040
 Is it because they wrote the joke?

15:15.040 --> 15:15.880
 Probably not.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.240
 I mean, if they did, maybe, or the cartoon, right?

15:18.240 --> 15:19.440
 They're getting a bunch of reputation

15:19.440 --> 15:22.640
 based on someone else's work that's not even programming.

15:22.640 --> 15:23.600
 It's just a joke, right?

15:23.600 --> 15:24.800
 It's related to programming.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.440
 So you begin to resent that.

15:26.440 --> 15:27.520
 You're like, well, that's not fair.

15:27.520 --> 15:28.000
 And it isn't.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.080
 At some level, they're correct.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.000
 I mean, I empathize.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.200
 Because it's not correct to get reputation for that.

15:32.200 --> 15:36.040
 Versus here's a really gnarly regular expression problem.

15:36.040 --> 15:40.040
 And here's a really clever, insightful, detailed answer

15:40.040 --> 15:41.640
 laying out, oh, here's why you're

15:41.640 --> 15:42.560
 seeing the behavior that you're seeing.

15:42.560 --> 15:43.880
 Here, let me teach you some things about how

15:43.880 --> 15:44.920
 to avoid that in the future.

15:44.920 --> 15:45.680
 That's great.

15:45.680 --> 15:46.560
 That's gold, right?

15:46.560 --> 15:47.920
 You want people to get reputation for that,

15:47.920 --> 15:50.960
 not so much for, wow, look at this funny thing I saw, right?

15:50.960 --> 15:51.480
 Great.

15:51.480 --> 15:54.320
 So there's this very specific Q&A format.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.440
 And then take me through the journey towards discourse

15:57.440 --> 15:58.600
 and Facebook and Twitter.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.440
 So you started at the beginning that Stack Overflow

16:01.440 --> 16:02.960
 evolved to have a purpose.

16:02.960 --> 16:06.320
 So what is discourse, this passion

16:06.320 --> 16:10.800
 you have for creating community for discussion?

16:10.800 --> 16:12.160
 When was that born and how?

16:12.160 --> 16:13.560
 Well, part of it is based on the realization

16:13.560 --> 16:16.560
 that Stack Overflow is only good for very specific subjects

16:16.560 --> 16:19.680
 where it's based on data, facts, and science,

16:19.680 --> 16:22.480
 where answers can be kind of verified to be true.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.840
 Another form of that is there's the book of knowledge,

16:24.840 --> 16:28.440
 like the tome of knowledge that defines whatever it is.

16:28.440 --> 16:30.840
 You can refer to that book and it'll give you the answer.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.080
 There has to be, it only works on subjects

16:33.080 --> 16:35.320
 where there's like semi clear answers to things

16:35.320 --> 16:37.520
 that can be verified in some form.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.760
 Now again, there's always more than one way to do it.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.880
 There's complete flexibility and system around that.

16:41.880 --> 16:45.280
 But where it falls down is stuff like poker and LEGO.

16:45.280 --> 16:48.720
 Like we had, if you go to stackexchange.com,

16:48.720 --> 16:50.400
 we have an engine that tries to launch

16:50.400 --> 16:52.280
 different Q&A topics, right?

16:52.280 --> 16:56.960
 And people can propose Q&A topics, sample questions,

16:56.960 --> 16:59.040
 and if it gets enough support within the network,

16:59.040 --> 17:00.080
 we launched that Q&A site.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.280
 So some of the ones we launched were poker and LEGO

17:02.280 --> 17:03.360
 and they did horribly, right?

17:03.360 --> 17:06.200
 Because I mean, they might still be there lingering on

17:06.200 --> 17:07.800
 in some form, but it was an experiment.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.000
 This is like a test, right?

17:09.000 --> 17:11.680
 And some subjects work super well on the stack engine

17:11.680 --> 17:12.720
 and some don't.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.600
 But the reason LEGO and poker don't work

17:14.600 --> 17:16.040
 is because they're so social, really.

17:16.040 --> 17:19.080
 It's not about what's the rule here in poker.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.440
 It's like, well, what kind of cigars

17:21.440 --> 17:23.480
 do we like to smoke while playing poker?

17:23.480 --> 17:26.920
 Or what's a cool set of cards to use when I'm playing poker?

17:26.920 --> 17:28.680
 Or what's some strategies?

17:28.680 --> 17:30.760
 Say I have this hand come up with some strategies

17:30.760 --> 17:31.200
 I could use.

17:31.200 --> 17:34.200
 It's more of a discussion around what's happening with LEGO.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.000
 Same thing, here's this cool LEGO set I found.

17:36.000 --> 17:36.880
 Look how awesome this is.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.520
 And I'm like, yeah, that's freaking awesome, right?

17:38.520 --> 17:39.880
 It's not a question, right?

17:39.880 --> 17:41.960
 There's all these social components and discussions

17:41.960 --> 17:43.200
 that don't fit at all.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.280
 We literally have to disallow those in Stack Overflow

17:45.280 --> 17:46.780
 because it's not about being social.

17:46.780 --> 17:49.360
 It's about problems that you're facing in your work

17:49.360 --> 17:51.000
 that you need concrete answers for.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.880
 You have a real demonstrated problem that's

17:52.880 --> 17:54.040
 blocking you in something.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.200
 Nobody's blocked by, what should I

17:56.200 --> 17:58.200
 do when I have a straight flush?

17:58.200 --> 18:00.400
 It's not a blocking problem in the world.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.320
 It's just an opportunity to hang out and discuss.

18:02.320 --> 18:07.680
 So discourse was a way to address that and say, look,

18:07.680 --> 18:10.680
 discussion forum software was very, very bad.

18:10.680 --> 18:18.400
 And when I came out of Stack Overflow in early 2012,

18:18.400 --> 18:19.800
 it was still very, very bad.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.800
 I expected it improved in the four years since I last looked,

18:22.800 --> 18:24.160
 but it had not improved at all.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.000
 And I was like, well, that's kind of terrible

18:26.000 --> 18:29.880
 because I love these communities of people talking about things

18:29.880 --> 18:31.120
 that they love.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.920
 They're just communities of interest, right?

18:32.920 --> 18:35.320
 And there's no good software for them.

18:35.320 --> 18:37.360
 Startups would come to me and say, hey, Jeff,

18:37.360 --> 18:39.720
 I want to have this startup.

18:39.720 --> 18:40.880
 Here's my idea.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.460
 And the first thing I would say to them

18:42.460 --> 18:44.160
 is, well, first, why are you asking me?

18:44.160 --> 18:47.440
 I don't really know your field necessarily.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.120
 Why aren't you asking the community,

18:49.120 --> 18:51.240
 the people that are interested in this problem,

18:51.240 --> 18:52.440
 the people that are using your product,

18:52.440 --> 18:53.960
 why aren't you talking to them?

18:53.960 --> 18:55.320
 And then they'd say, oh, great idea.

18:55.320 --> 18:56.080
 How do I do that?

18:56.080 --> 18:58.080
 And then that's when I started playing sad trombone

18:58.080 --> 19:00.040
 because I realized all the software involving

19:00.040 --> 19:03.240
 talking to your users, customers, audience, patrons,

19:03.240 --> 19:04.880
 whatever it is, it was all really bad.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.640
 It was stuff that I would be embarrassed

19:06.640 --> 19:08.320
 to recommend to other people.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.800
 And yet, that's where I felt they could get the biggest

19:10.800 --> 19:12.760
 and strongest, most effective input

19:12.760 --> 19:15.560
 for what they should be doing with their product, right?

19:15.560 --> 19:17.480
 It's from their users, from their community, right?

19:17.480 --> 19:18.840
 That's what we did on Stack Overflow.

19:18.840 --> 19:21.320
 So what we're talking about with forums,

19:21.320 --> 19:25.440
 the, what is it, the dark matter of the internet,

19:25.440 --> 19:26.800
 it's still, I don't know if it's still,

19:26.800 --> 19:28.720
 but for the longest time,

19:28.720 --> 19:31.480
 it has some of the most passionate

19:31.480 --> 19:32.760
 and fascinating discussions.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.600
 And what's the usual structure?

19:34.600 --> 19:38.160
 There's usually, it's linear, so it's sequential.

19:38.160 --> 19:39.600
 So you're posting one after the other

19:39.600 --> 19:42.760
 and there's pagination, so it's every,

19:42.760 --> 19:45.000
 there's 10 posts and then you go to the next page.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.040
 And that format still is used by,

19:48.040 --> 19:50.040
 like I'm, we're doing a lot of research

19:50.040 --> 19:53.560
 with Tesla vehicles and there's a Tesla Motors Club forum,

19:53.560 --> 19:54.400
 which is extremely.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.240
 We really wanted to run that actually.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.680
 They pinged us about it, I don't think we got it,

19:57.680 --> 19:59.200
 but I really would have liked to gotten that one.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.560
 But they've started before even 2012, I believe.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.160
 I mean, they've been running for a long time.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.800
 It's still an extremely rich source of information.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.680
 So what's broken about that system

20:09.680 --> 20:12.120
 and how are you trying to fix it?

20:12.120 --> 20:15.840
 I think there's a lot of power in connecting people

20:15.840 --> 20:19.120
 that love the same stuff around that specific topic.

20:19.120 --> 20:22.120
 Meaning Facebook's idea of connection is

20:22.120 --> 20:24.520
 just any human that's related to another human, right?

20:24.520 --> 20:27.440
 Like through friendship or any other reason.

20:27.440 --> 20:28.720
 Facebook's idea of the world

20:28.720 --> 20:30.400
 is sort of the status update, right?

20:30.400 --> 20:32.440
 Like a friend of yours did something,

20:32.440 --> 20:34.960
 ate at a restaurant, right?

20:34.960 --> 20:37.200
 Whereas discussion forums were traditionally

20:37.200 --> 20:38.240
 around the interest graph.

20:38.240 --> 20:40.280
 Like I love electric cars,

20:40.280 --> 20:41.920
 specifically I love Tesla, right?

20:41.920 --> 20:44.240
 Like I love the way they approach the problem.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.840
 I love the style of the founder.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.120
 I just love the design ethic.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.200
 And there's a lot to like about Tesla.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.160
 I don't know if you saw the oatmeal,

20:50.160 --> 20:53.040
 he did a whole love comic to Tesla.

20:53.040 --> 20:53.880
 And it was actually kind of cool

20:53.880 --> 20:54.720
 because I learned some stuff.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.960
 He was talking about how great Tesla cars were specifically,

20:56.960 --> 20:58.280
 like how they were built differently.

20:58.280 --> 20:59.800
 And he went into a lot of great detail

20:59.800 --> 21:00.640
 that was really interesting.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.600
 And to me, that oatmeal post, if you read it,

21:02.600 --> 21:05.720
 is the genesis of pretty much all interest communities.

21:05.720 --> 21:06.960
 I just really love this stuff.

21:06.960 --> 21:08.400
 So like for me, for example, there's yo yos, right?

21:08.400 --> 21:09.680
 Like I'm into the yo yo communities.

21:09.680 --> 21:11.720
 And these interest communities

21:11.720 --> 21:12.920
 are just really fascinating to me.

21:12.920 --> 21:15.200
 And I feel more connected to the yo yo communities

21:15.200 --> 21:18.600
 than I do to friends that I don't see that often, right?

21:18.600 --> 21:21.720
 Like to me, the powerful thing is the interest graph.

21:21.720 --> 21:25.000
 And Facebook kind of dabbles in the interest graph.

21:25.000 --> 21:25.920
 I mean, they have groups,

21:25.920 --> 21:26.960
 you can sign up for groups and stuff,

21:26.960 --> 21:29.440
 but it's really about the relationship graph.

21:29.440 --> 21:32.080
 Like this is my coworker, this is my relative,

21:32.080 --> 21:35.280
 this is my friend, but not so much about the interest.

21:35.280 --> 21:36.920
 So I think that's the linchpin

21:36.920 --> 21:39.200
 of which forums and communities are built on

21:39.200 --> 21:40.320
 that I personally love.

21:40.320 --> 21:44.240
 Like I said, leadership is about passion, right?

21:44.240 --> 21:45.520
 And being passionate about stuff

21:45.520 --> 21:47.520
 is a really valid way to look at the world.

21:47.520 --> 21:50.560
 And I think it's a way a lot of stuff in the world

21:50.560 --> 21:51.400
 gets done.

21:51.400 --> 21:52.880
 Like I once had someone describe me as,

21:52.880 --> 21:54.640
 he's like, Jeff, you're a guy who,

21:54.640 --> 21:57.560
 you just get super passionate about a few things at a time,

21:57.560 --> 21:59.760
 and you just go super deep in those things.

21:59.760 --> 22:00.720
 And I was like, oh, that's kind of right.

22:00.720 --> 22:01.560
 That's kind of what I do.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.400
 I get into something and just be super into that

22:03.400 --> 22:04.560
 for a couple of years or whatever,

22:04.560 --> 22:05.960
 and just learn all I can about it,

22:05.960 --> 22:07.800
 and go super deep in it.

22:07.800 --> 22:11.000
 And that's how I enjoy experiencing the world, right?

22:11.000 --> 22:12.400
 Like not being shallow on a bunch of things,

22:12.400 --> 22:14.320
 but being really deep on a few things

22:14.320 --> 22:15.360
 that I'm interested in.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.200
 So forums kind of unlock that, right?

22:17.200 --> 22:18.920
 And you don't want a world

22:18.920 --> 22:20.920
 where everything belongs to Facebook, at least I don't.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.760
 I want a world where communities can kind of own themselves,

22:22.760 --> 22:25.120
 set their own norms, set their own rules,

22:25.120 --> 22:26.320
 control the experience.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.720
 Because community is also about ownership, right?

22:28.720 --> 22:32.160
 Like if you're meeting at the Barnes and Noble every Thursday

22:32.160 --> 22:33.440
 and Barnes and Noble says, get out of here,

22:33.440 --> 22:34.600
 you guys don't buy enough books.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.640
 Well, you know, you're kind of hosed, right?

22:36.640 --> 22:37.880
 Barnes and Noble owns you, right?

22:37.880 --> 22:38.880
 Like you can't.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.320
 But if you have your own meeting space,

22:40.320 --> 22:41.440
 you know, your own clubhouse,

22:41.440 --> 22:43.040
 you can set your own rules,

22:43.040 --> 22:44.560
 decide what you want to talk about there,

22:44.560 --> 22:47.800
 and just really generate a lot better information

22:47.800 --> 22:49.520
 than you could like hanging out at Barnes and Noble

22:49.520 --> 22:51.920
 every Thursday at 3 p.m., right?

22:51.920 --> 22:53.840
 So that's kind of the vision of Discourse,

22:53.840 --> 22:57.160
 is a place where it's fully open source.

22:57.160 --> 22:59.160
 You can take the software, you can install it anywhere,

22:59.160 --> 23:00.920
 and, you know, you and a group of people

23:00.920 --> 23:02.880
 can go deep on whatever it is that you're into.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.440
 And this works for startups, right?

23:04.440 --> 23:05.960
 Startups are a group of people

23:05.960 --> 23:08.440
 who go super deep on a specific problem, right?

23:08.440 --> 23:09.600
 And they want to talk to the community.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.040
 It's like, well, install Discourse, right?

23:11.040 --> 23:12.040
 That's what we do at Discourse.

23:12.040 --> 23:13.560
 That's what I did at Stack Overflow.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.520
 I spent a lot of time on Meta Stack Overflow,

23:15.520 --> 23:20.200
 which is our internal, well, public community feedback site,

23:20.200 --> 23:24.000
 and just experiencing what the users were experiencing,

23:24.000 --> 23:24.840
 right, because they're the ones

23:24.840 --> 23:26.080
 doing all the work in the system.

23:26.080 --> 23:27.600
 And they had a lot of interesting feedback.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.240
 And there's that 90, 10 rule of, like,

23:29.240 --> 23:31.640
 90% of the feedback you get is not really actionable

23:31.640 --> 23:32.480
 for a variety of reasons.

23:32.480 --> 23:34.640
 It might be bad feedback, it might be crazy feedback,

23:34.640 --> 23:36.400
 it might be feedback you just can't act on right now.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.320
 But there's 10% of it that's like gold.

23:38.320 --> 23:39.760
 It's like literally gold and diamonds,

23:39.760 --> 23:42.440
 where it's like feedback of really good improvements

23:42.440 --> 23:44.800
 to your core product that are not super hard to get to

23:44.800 --> 23:45.800
 and actually make a lot of sense.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.800
 And my favorite is about 5% of those stuff

23:47.800 --> 23:48.680
 I didn't even see coming.

23:48.680 --> 23:50.480
 It's like, oh my God, I never even thought of that.

23:50.480 --> 23:52.560
 But that's a brilliant idea, right?

23:52.560 --> 23:54.560
 And I can point to so many features of Stack Overflow

23:54.560 --> 23:56.680
 that we derive from Meta Stack Overflow feedback

23:56.680 --> 23:58.000
 and Meta discourse, right?

23:58.000 --> 24:01.220
 Same exact principle of discourse, you know?

24:01.220 --> 24:02.060
 We're getting ideas from the community.

24:02.060 --> 24:03.440
 I was like, oh my God, I never thought of that,

24:03.440 --> 24:04.640
 but that's fantastic, right?

24:04.640 --> 24:06.920
 Like, I love that relationship with the community.

24:06.920 --> 24:08.680
 From having built these communities,

24:08.680 --> 24:11.080
 what have you learned about?

24:11.080 --> 24:13.320
 What's the process of getting a critical mass of members

24:13.320 --> 24:14.160
 in a community?

24:14.160 --> 24:17.000
 Is it luck, skill, timing, persistence?

24:17.000 --> 24:20.340
 What is, is it the tools, like discourse,

24:20.340 --> 24:21.840
 that empower that community?

24:21.840 --> 24:25.840
 What's the key aspect of starting for one guy or gal

24:25.840 --> 24:27.720
 and then building it to two and then 10

24:27.720 --> 24:29.960
 and a hundred and a thousand and so on?

24:29.960 --> 24:32.280
 I think when you're starting with an N of one,

24:32.280 --> 24:33.880
 I mean, I think it's persistence

24:33.880 --> 24:37.000
 and also you have to be interesting.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.040
 Like somebody I really admire once said something

24:39.040 --> 24:40.160
 that I always liked about blogging.

24:40.160 --> 24:41.800
 He's like, here's how you blog.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.400
 You have to have something interesting to say

24:44.400 --> 24:46.920
 and have an interesting way of saying it, right?

24:46.920 --> 24:48.960
 And then do that for like 10 years.

24:49.880 --> 24:50.920
 So that's the genesis,

24:50.920 --> 24:53.280
 is like you have to have sort of something interesting

24:53.280 --> 24:55.260
 to say that's not exactly what everybody else is saying

24:55.260 --> 24:56.360
 and an interesting way of saying it,

24:56.360 --> 24:57.260
 which is another way of saying,

24:57.260 --> 24:59.240
 kind of entertaining way of saying it.

24:59.240 --> 25:01.920
 And then as far as growing it, it's like ritual.

25:01.920 --> 25:04.240
 You know, like you have to, like say you're starting a blog,

25:04.240 --> 25:06.680
 you have to say, look, I'm gonna blog every week,

25:06.680 --> 25:07.960
 three times a week,

25:07.960 --> 25:09.940
 and you have to stick to that schedule, right?

25:09.940 --> 25:12.840
 Because until you do that for like several years,

25:12.840 --> 25:14.360
 you're never gonna get anywhere.

25:14.360 --> 25:16.680
 Like it just takes years to get to where you need to get to.

25:16.680 --> 25:18.680
 And part of that is having the discipline

25:18.680 --> 25:19.720
 to stick with the schedule.

25:19.720 --> 25:21.440
 And it helps, again, if it's something you're passionate

25:21.440 --> 25:22.720
 about, this won't feel like work.

25:22.720 --> 25:23.560
 You're like, I love this.

25:23.560 --> 25:25.640
 I could talk about this all day, every day, right?

25:26.840 --> 25:27.680
 You just have to do it in a way

25:27.680 --> 25:28.640
 that's interesting to other people.

25:28.640 --> 25:30.640
 And then as you're growing the community,

25:30.640 --> 25:32.480
 that pattern of participation within the community

25:32.480 --> 25:34.320
 of like generating these artifacts

25:34.320 --> 25:35.720
 and inviting other people to help you

25:35.720 --> 25:36.960
 like collaborate on these artifacts,

25:36.960 --> 25:38.280
 like even in the case of blogging,

25:38.280 --> 25:40.880
 like I felt in the early days of my blog,

25:40.880 --> 25:41.960
 which I started in 2004,

25:41.960 --> 25:43.760
 which is really the genesis of Stack Overflow.

25:43.760 --> 25:46.280
 If you look at all my blog, it leads up to Stack Overflow,

25:46.280 --> 25:48.440
 which was, I have all this energy in my blog,

25:48.440 --> 25:51.320
 but I don't, like 40,000 people were subscribing to me.

25:51.320 --> 25:52.440
 And I was like, I wanna do something.

25:52.440 --> 25:54.160
 And then I met Joel and said, hey, Joel,

25:54.160 --> 25:55.320
 I wanna do something,

25:55.320 --> 25:57.360
 take this ball of energy from my blog and do something.

25:57.360 --> 25:58.800
 And all the people reading my blog saw that.

25:58.800 --> 25:59.800
 It's like, oh, cool.

25:59.800 --> 26:00.640
 You're involving us.

26:00.640 --> 26:03.360
 You're saying, look, you're part of this community.

26:03.360 --> 26:04.560
 Let's build this thing together.

26:04.560 --> 26:05.520
 Like they pick the name.

26:05.520 --> 26:08.040
 Like we voted on the name for Stack Overflow on my blog.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.960
 Like we came up, and naming is super hard.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.240
 First of all, the hardest problem in computer science

26:12.240 --> 26:14.520
 is coming up with a good name for stuff, right?

26:14.520 --> 26:15.880
 But you can go back to my blog.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.640
 There's the poll where we voted

26:17.640 --> 26:19.240
 and Stack Overflow became the name of the site.

26:19.240 --> 26:21.160
 And all the early beta users of Stack Overflow

26:21.160 --> 26:24.600
 were audience of my blog plus Joel's blog, right?

26:24.600 --> 26:26.520
 So we started from, like, if you look at the genesis,

26:26.520 --> 26:28.160
 okay, I was just a programmer who said,

26:28.160 --> 26:29.680
 hey, I love programming,

26:29.680 --> 26:31.000
 but I have no outlet to talk about it.

26:31.000 --> 26:31.920
 So I'm just gonna blog about it,

26:31.920 --> 26:33.320
 because I don't have enough people to work

26:33.320 --> 26:34.360
 to talk to about it.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.440
 Because at the time I worked a place where,

26:36.440 --> 26:37.960
 you know, programming wasn't the core output

26:37.960 --> 26:40.840
 of the company, it was a pharmaceutical company.

26:40.840 --> 26:43.560
 And I just love this stuff, you know, to an absurd degree.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.960
 So I was like, I'll just blog about it.

26:44.960 --> 26:45.960
 And then I'll find an audience

26:45.960 --> 26:47.720
 and eventually found an audience,

26:47.720 --> 26:49.000
 eventually found Joel,

26:49.000 --> 26:50.480
 and eventually built Stack Overflow

26:50.480 --> 26:52.880
 from that one core of activity, right?

26:52.880 --> 26:55.880
 But it was that repetition of feeding back in feedback

26:55.880 --> 26:58.080
 from my blog comments, feedback from Joel,

26:58.080 --> 27:01.480
 feedback from the early Stack Overflow community.

27:01.480 --> 27:02.880
 When people see that you're doing that,

27:02.880 --> 27:04.160
 they will follow along with you, right?

27:04.160 --> 27:05.520
 They'll say, cool, you're here in good faith.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.280
 You're actually, you know, not listening to everything

27:07.280 --> 27:09.320
 because that's impossible, that's impossible.

27:09.320 --> 27:11.720
 But you're actually, you know,

27:11.720 --> 27:14.120
 waiting our feedback and what you're doing.

27:14.120 --> 27:14.960
 And why wouldn't I?

27:14.960 --> 27:16.720
 Because who does all the work on Stack Overflow?

27:16.720 --> 27:17.960
 Me, Joel?

27:17.960 --> 27:19.680
 No, it's the other programmers

27:19.680 --> 27:20.560
 that are doing all the work.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.400
 So you gotta have some respect for that.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.920
 And then, you know, discipline around,

27:24.920 --> 27:26.480
 look, you know, we're trying to do a very specific thing

27:26.480 --> 27:27.320
 here on Stack Overflow.

27:27.320 --> 27:29.160
 We're not trying to solve all the world's problems.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.000
 We're trying to solve this very specific Q and A problem

27:31.000 --> 27:32.400
 in a very specific way.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.640
 Not cause we're jerks about it,

27:33.640 --> 27:36.040
 but because these strict set of rules

27:36.040 --> 27:39.440
 help us get really good results, right?

27:39.440 --> 27:41.520
 And programmers, that's an easy sell for the most part

27:41.520 --> 27:42.600
 because programmers are used to dealing

27:42.600 --> 27:45.120
 with ridiculous systems of rules like constantly.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.840
 That's basically their job.

27:46.840 --> 27:49.520
 So they're very, oh yeah, super strict system of rules

27:49.520 --> 27:50.440
 that lets me get what I want.

27:50.440 --> 27:51.620
 That's programming, right?

27:51.620 --> 27:53.680
 That's what Stack Overflow is, so.

27:53.680 --> 27:54.920
 So you're making it sound easy,

27:54.920 --> 27:58.000
 but in 2004, let's go back there.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.520
 In 2004, you started the blog, Coding Horror.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.600
 Was it called that at the very beginning?

28:03.600 --> 28:04.440
 It was.

28:04.440 --> 28:05.280
 One of the smart things I did,

28:05.280 --> 28:06.720
 it's from a book by Steve McConnell, Code Complete,

28:06.720 --> 28:08.240
 which is one of my favorite programming books,

28:08.240 --> 28:09.800
 still probably my number one programming book

28:09.800 --> 28:10.800
 for anyone to read.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.840
 So one of the smart things I did back then,

28:13.840 --> 28:16.080
 I don't always do smart things when I start stuff.

28:16.080 --> 28:18.400
 I contacted Steve and said, hey, I really like this.

28:18.400 --> 28:19.640
 It was a sidebar illustration

28:19.640 --> 28:21.820
 indicating danger in code, right?

28:21.820 --> 28:23.880
 Coding Horror was like, watch out.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.360
 And I love that illustration because it spoke to me.

28:27.360 --> 28:29.520
 Because I saw that illustration go, oh my God, that's me.

28:29.520 --> 28:31.080
 Like I'm always my own worst enemy.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.360
 Like that's the key insight in programming is

28:33.360 --> 28:34.320
 every time you write something,

28:34.320 --> 28:36.600
 think how am I gonna screw myself?

28:36.600 --> 28:39.280
 Because you will, constantly, right?

28:39.280 --> 28:41.280
 So that icon was like, oh yeah,

28:41.280 --> 28:43.200
 I need to constantly hold that mirror up and look,

28:43.200 --> 28:45.440
 and say, look, you're very fallible.

28:45.440 --> 28:46.400
 You're gonna screw this up.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.040
 Like how can you build this in such a way

28:48.040 --> 28:50.380
 that you're not gonna screw it up later?

28:50.380 --> 28:53.040
 Like how can you get that discipline around

28:53.040 --> 28:54.920
 making sure at every step I'm thinking through

28:54.920 --> 28:56.200
 all the things that I could do wrong

28:56.200 --> 28:57.280
 or that other people could do wrong?

28:57.280 --> 28:58.920
 Because that is actually how you get to be

28:58.920 --> 29:00.600
 a better programmer a lot of times, right?

29:00.600 --> 29:03.400
 So that sidebar illustration, I loved it so much.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.640
 And I wrote Steve before I started my blog and said,

29:05.640 --> 29:06.800
 hey, can I have permission to use this

29:06.800 --> 29:08.460
 because I just really like this illustration?

29:08.460 --> 29:11.280
 And Steve was kind enough to give me permission to do that

29:11.280 --> 29:13.280
 and just continues to give me permission, so yeah.

29:13.280 --> 29:15.080
 Really, that's awesome.

29:15.080 --> 29:18.880
 But in 2004, you started this blog.

29:18.880 --> 29:22.600
 You know, you look at Stephen King, his book on writing,

29:22.600 --> 29:26.460
 or Stephen Pressfield, War of Art book.

29:26.460 --> 29:30.040
 I mean, it seems like writers suffer.

29:30.040 --> 29:32.080
 I mean, it's a hard process of writing, right?

29:32.080 --> 29:34.200
 There's gonna be suffering.

29:34.200 --> 29:35.200
 I mean, I won't kid you.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.400
 Well, the work is suffering, right?

29:36.400 --> 29:38.680
 Like doing the work, like even when you're every week,

29:38.680 --> 29:40.280
 you're like, okay, that blog post wasn't very good

29:40.280 --> 29:43.360
 or people didn't like it or people said disparaging things

29:43.360 --> 29:44.200
 about it.

29:44.200 --> 29:47.440
 You have to like have the attitude like, you know,

29:47.440 --> 29:49.480
 no matter what happens, I wanna do this for me, right?

29:49.480 --> 29:51.220
 It's not about you, it's about me.

29:51.220 --> 29:53.320
 I mean, in the end, it is about everyone

29:53.320 --> 29:55.840
 because this is how good work gets out into the world.

29:55.840 --> 29:59.780
 But you have to be pretty strict about saying like,

29:59.780 --> 30:01.640
 you know, I'm selfish in the sense

30:01.640 --> 30:03.260
 that I have to do this for me.

30:03.260 --> 30:04.360
 You know, you mentioned Stephen King,

30:04.360 --> 30:05.460
 like his book on writing.

30:05.460 --> 30:06.840
 But like one of the things I do, for example,

30:06.840 --> 30:08.680
 when writing is like, I read it out loud.

30:08.680 --> 30:10.640
 One of the best pieces of advice for writing anything

30:10.640 --> 30:13.880
 is read it out loud, like multiple times

30:13.880 --> 30:15.800
 and make it sound like you're talking

30:15.800 --> 30:17.840
 because that is the goal of good writing.

30:17.840 --> 30:19.200
 It should sound like you said it

30:19.200 --> 30:20.840
 with slightly better phrasing

30:20.840 --> 30:22.080
 because you have more time to think about what you're saying

30:22.080 --> 30:24.360
 but like, it should sound natural when you say it.

30:24.360 --> 30:26.560
 And I think that's probably the single best

30:26.560 --> 30:27.560
 writing advice I can give anyone.

30:27.560 --> 30:29.760
 Just read it over and over out loud,

30:29.760 --> 30:32.600
 make sure it sounds like something you would normally say

30:32.600 --> 30:33.680
 and it sounds good.

30:33.680 --> 30:35.600
 And what's your process of writing?

30:35.600 --> 30:37.800
 See, there's usually a pretty good idea

30:37.800 --> 30:39.360
 behind the blog post.

30:39.360 --> 30:40.200
 So ideas, right.

30:40.200 --> 30:43.300
 So I think you gotta have the concept

30:43.300 --> 30:46.180
 that there's so many interesting things in the world.

30:46.180 --> 30:48.800
 Like, I mean, my God, the world is amazing, right?

30:48.800 --> 30:51.960
 Like you can never write about everything that's going on

30:51.960 --> 30:52.800
 because it's so incredible.

30:52.800 --> 30:54.180
 But if you can't come up with like,

30:54.180 --> 30:57.100
 let's say one interesting thing per day to talk about,

30:57.100 --> 30:58.360
 then you're not trying hard enough

30:58.360 --> 31:00.720
 because the world is full of just super interesting stuff.

31:00.720 --> 31:03.120
 And one great way to like mine stuff

31:03.120 --> 31:04.240
 is go back to old books

31:04.240 --> 31:07.200
 cause they bring up old stuff that's still super relevant.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.160
 And I did that a lot

31:08.160 --> 31:09.880
 cause I was like reading classic programming books

31:09.880 --> 31:11.260
 and a lot of the early blog posts were like,

31:11.260 --> 31:12.280
 oh, I was reading this programming book

31:12.280 --> 31:13.760
 and they brought this really cool concept

31:13.760 --> 31:15.000
 and I wanna talk about it some more.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.080
 And you get the, I mean,

31:16.080 --> 31:17.280
 you're not claiming credit for the idea

31:17.280 --> 31:18.660
 but it gives you something interesting to talk about

31:18.660 --> 31:19.880
 that's kind of evergreen, right?

31:19.880 --> 31:21.960
 Like you don't have to go, what should I talk about?

31:21.960 --> 31:24.600
 So we'll just go dig up some old classic programming books

31:24.600 --> 31:26.980
 and find something that, oh, wow, that's interesting.

31:26.980 --> 31:28.160
 Or how does that apply today?

31:28.160 --> 31:30.960
 Or what about X and Y or compare these two concepts.

31:30.960 --> 31:33.200
 So pull a couple of sentences from that book

31:33.200 --> 31:34.720
 and then sort of play off of it,

31:34.720 --> 31:36.160
 almost agree or disagree.

31:36.160 --> 31:41.160
 So in 2007, you wrote that you were offered

31:41.880 --> 31:44.440
 a significant amount of money to sell the blog.

31:44.440 --> 31:45.960
 You chose not to.

31:45.960 --> 31:48.960
 What were all the elements you were thinking about?

31:48.960 --> 31:50.520
 Cause I'd like to take you back.

31:50.520 --> 31:52.520
 It seems like there's a lot of nonlinear decisions

31:52.520 --> 31:54.320
 you made through life.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.040
 So what was that decision like?

31:56.040 --> 31:57.840
 Right, so one of the things I love

31:57.840 --> 31:59.360
 is the Choose Your Own Adventure books,

31:59.360 --> 32:00.280
 which I loved as a kid

32:00.280 --> 32:01.720
 and I feel like they're early programmer books

32:01.720 --> 32:04.040
 cause they're all about if then statements, right?

32:04.040 --> 32:05.080
 If this, then this.

32:05.080 --> 32:07.240
 And they're also very, very unforgiving.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.920
 Like there's all these sites that map

32:08.920 --> 32:11.040
 the classic Choose Your Own Adventure books

32:11.040 --> 32:13.940
 and how many outcomes are bad, a lot of bad outcomes.

32:13.940 --> 32:16.080
 So part of the game is like, oh, I got a bad outcome.

32:16.080 --> 32:17.840
 Go back one step, go back one further step.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.160
 It's like, how did I get here, right?

32:19.160 --> 32:21.900
 Like it's a sequence of decisions.

32:21.900 --> 32:23.160
 And this is true of life, right?

32:23.160 --> 32:24.960
 Like every decision is a sequence, right?

32:24.960 --> 32:28.320
 Individually, any individual decision

32:28.320 --> 32:29.240
 is not necessarily right or wrong,

32:29.240 --> 32:31.040
 but they lead you down a path, right?

32:31.040 --> 32:32.760
 So I do think there's some truth to that.

32:32.760 --> 32:34.740
 So this particular decision,

32:34.740 --> 32:36.320
 the blog had gotten fairly popular.

32:36.320 --> 32:39.080
 There's a lot of RSS readers that I had discovered.

32:39.080 --> 32:40.980
 And this guy contacted me out of the blue

32:40.980 --> 32:42.440
 from this like bug tracking company.

32:42.440 --> 32:43.840
 He's like, oh, I really wanna buy your blog

32:43.840 --> 32:46.040
 for like, I think it was around,

32:46.040 --> 32:47.920
 it was $100,000, it might have been like 80,000,

32:47.920 --> 32:49.240
 but it was a lot, right?

32:49.240 --> 32:51.120
 Like, and that's, you know, at the time,

32:51.120 --> 32:54.420
 like I would have a year's worth of salary all at once.

32:54.420 --> 32:57.720
 So I didn't really think about like, well, you know,

32:57.720 --> 32:58.560
 and I remember talking to people at the time,

32:58.560 --> 32:59.840
 I was like, wow, that's a lot of money.

32:59.840 --> 33:02.000
 But then I'm like, I really like my blog, right?

33:02.000 --> 33:03.720
 Like, do I wanna sell my blog?

33:03.720 --> 33:05.940
 Cause it wouldn't really belong to me anymore at that point.

33:05.940 --> 33:09.360
 And one of the guidelines that I like to,

33:09.360 --> 33:11.040
 I don't like to give advice to people a lot,

33:11.040 --> 33:12.520
 but one of the pieces of advice I do give,

33:12.520 --> 33:15.560
 cause I do think it's really true and it's generally helpful

33:15.560 --> 33:17.600
 is whenever you're looking at a set of decisions,

33:17.600 --> 33:19.860
 like, oh gosh, should I do A, B or C,

33:19.860 --> 33:22.500
 you gotta pick the thing that's a little scarier

33:22.500 --> 33:24.540
 in that list because not, you know,

33:24.540 --> 33:25.680
 not like jump off a cliff scary,

33:25.680 --> 33:27.000
 but the thing that makes you nervous.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
 Cause if you pick the safe choice,

33:29.000 --> 33:30.380
 it's usually, you're not really pushing.

33:30.380 --> 33:31.400
 You're not pushing yourself.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.940
 You're not choosing the thing that's gonna help you grow.

33:33.940 --> 33:36.160
 So for me, the scarier choice was to say no.

33:36.160 --> 33:38.040
 I was like, well, no, let's just see where this is going.

33:38.040 --> 33:38.880
 Right?

33:38.880 --> 33:39.700
 Because then I own it.

33:39.700 --> 33:40.540
 I mean, it belongs to me.

33:40.540 --> 33:42.000
 It's my thing.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.120
 And I can just take it

33:43.120 --> 33:45.360
 and tell some other logical conclusion, right?

33:45.360 --> 33:46.880
 Because imagine how different the world would have been

33:46.880 --> 33:49.040
 had I said yes and sold the blog.

33:49.040 --> 33:51.560
 It's like, there probably wouldn't be Stack Overflow.

33:51.560 --> 33:53.640
 You know, a lot of other stuff would have changed.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.360
 So for that particular decision,

33:55.360 --> 33:56.280
 I think it was that same rule.

33:56.280 --> 33:57.920
 Like what scares me a little bit more.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.200
 Do the thing that scares you.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.040
 Yeah.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.740
 So speaking of which, startups.

34:01.740 --> 34:05.000
 I think there's a specific, some more general questions

34:05.000 --> 34:07.560
 that a lot of people would be interested in.

34:07.560 --> 34:10.320
 You've started Stack Overflow.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.080
 You started this course.

34:12.080 --> 34:15.320
 So what's the, it was one, two, three guys,

34:15.320 --> 34:17.200
 whatever it is in the beginning.

34:17.200 --> 34:19.360
 What was that process like?

34:19.360 --> 34:20.680
 Do you start talking about it?

34:20.680 --> 34:21.800
 Do you start programming?

34:21.800 --> 34:24.560
 Do you start, like, where's the birth

34:24.560 --> 34:25.880
 and the catalyst that actually.

34:25.880 --> 34:27.040
 Well, I can talk about it in the context

34:27.040 --> 34:28.120
 of both Stack Overflow and Discourse.

34:28.120 --> 34:31.080
 So I think the key thing initially is there is a problem.

34:31.080 --> 34:32.440
 Something, there's some state of the world

34:32.440 --> 34:34.400
 that's unsatisfactory to the point that, like,

34:34.400 --> 34:35.960
 you're upset about it, right?

34:35.960 --> 34:37.840
 Like, in that case, it was experts exchange.

34:37.840 --> 34:38.960
 I mean, Joel's original idea,

34:38.960 --> 34:40.200
 because I approached Joel as like,

34:40.200 --> 34:41.760
 look, Joel, I have all this energy behind my blog.

34:41.760 --> 34:42.600
 I want to do something.

34:42.600 --> 34:43.440
 I want to build something.

34:43.440 --> 34:44.260
 But I don't know what it is,

34:44.260 --> 34:45.720
 because I'm honestly not a good idea person.

34:45.720 --> 34:46.560
 I'm really not.

34:46.560 --> 34:47.760
 I'm like the execution guy.

34:47.760 --> 34:48.680
 I'm really good at execution,

34:48.680 --> 34:51.000
 but I'm not good at, like, blue skying ideas.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.080
 Not my forte.

34:52.080 --> 34:54.080
 Which is another reason why I like the community feedback,

34:54.080 --> 34:56.320
 because they blue sky all day long for you, right?

34:56.320 --> 34:57.760
 So when I can just go in and cherry pick

34:57.760 --> 34:59.320
 a blue sky idea from community,

34:59.320 --> 35:00.800
 even if I have to spend three hours reading

35:00.800 --> 35:02.720
 to get one good idea, it's worth it, man.

35:02.720 --> 35:04.680
 But anyway, so the idea from Joel was,

35:04.680 --> 35:07.400
 hey, experts exchange, it's got great data,

35:07.400 --> 35:09.040
 but the experience is hideous, right?

35:09.040 --> 35:09.920
 It's trying to trick you.

35:09.920 --> 35:11.040
 It feels like used car salesman.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.040
 It's just bad.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.080
 So I was like, oh, that's awesome.

35:13.080 --> 35:14.280
 It feeds into community.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.120
 It feeds into, like, you know,

35:15.120 --> 35:16.680
 we can make creative comments.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.520
 So I think the core is to have a really good idea

35:18.520 --> 35:20.280
 that you feel very strongly about in the beginning,

35:20.280 --> 35:22.000
 that, like, there's a wrong in the world,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.240
 an injustice that we will write

35:24.240 --> 35:26.080
 through the process of building this thing.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.480
 For Discourse, it was like, look,

35:27.480 --> 35:30.160
 there's no good software for communities

35:30.160 --> 35:32.920
 to just hang out and, like, do stuff, right?

35:32.920 --> 35:35.440
 Like, whether it's problem solving, startup, whatever.

35:35.440 --> 35:37.600
 Forums are such a great building block of online community,

35:37.600 --> 35:38.560
 and they're hideous.

35:38.560 --> 35:39.720
 They were so bad, right?

35:39.720 --> 35:40.720
 It was embarrassing.

35:40.720 --> 35:42.000
 Like, I literally was embarrassed

35:42.000 --> 35:43.920
 to be associated with this software, right?

35:43.920 --> 35:45.680
 I was like, we have to have software that you can be proud of.

35:45.680 --> 35:47.080
 It's like, this is competitive with Reddit.

35:47.080 --> 35:48.320
 This is competitive with Twitter.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.320
 This is competitive with Facebook, right?

35:50.320 --> 35:53.440
 I would be proud to have the software on my site.

35:53.440 --> 35:54.840
 So that was the genesis of Discourse,

35:54.840 --> 35:59.840
 was feeling very strongly about there needs to be

35:59.840 --> 36:01.680
 a good solution for communities.

36:01.680 --> 36:02.640
 So that's step one.

36:02.640 --> 36:04.520
 Genesis of an idea you feel super strongly about, right?

36:04.520 --> 36:06.600
 And then people galvanize around the idea.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.480
 Like, Joel was already super excited about the idea.

36:08.480 --> 36:09.920
 I was excited about the idea.

36:09.920 --> 36:13.240
 So with the forum software, I was posting on Twitter.

36:13.240 --> 36:15.000
 I had researched, as part of my research,

36:15.000 --> 36:16.600
 I start researching the problem, right?

36:16.600 --> 36:19.480
 And I found a game called Forum Wars,

36:19.480 --> 36:21.480
 which was a parody of forum.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.680
 It's still very, very funny, of forum behavior,

36:23.680 --> 36:26.120
 circa, I would say, 2003.

36:26.120 --> 36:27.720
 It's aged some, right?

36:27.720 --> 36:29.880
 Like, the behavior's a little different in there of Twitter.

36:29.880 --> 36:30.920
 But it was awesome.

36:30.920 --> 36:31.920
 It was very funny.

36:31.920 --> 36:32.800
 And it was like a game.

36:32.800 --> 36:33.520
 It was like an RPG.

36:33.520 --> 36:34.960
 And it had a forum attached to it.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.520
 So it was like a game about forums with a forum attached.

36:37.520 --> 36:38.520
 I was like, this is awesome, right?

36:38.520 --> 36:39.520
 This is so cool.

36:39.520 --> 36:41.920
 And the founder of that company, or that project,

36:41.920 --> 36:43.720
 it wasn't really a company, contacted me,

36:43.720 --> 36:45.440
 this guy Robin Ward from Toronto.

36:45.440 --> 36:47.400
 He said, hey, I saw you've been talking about forums.

36:47.400 --> 36:49.120
 And I really love that problem space.

36:49.120 --> 36:51.280
 He was like, I'd still love to build really good forum

36:51.280 --> 36:53.440
 software, because I don't think anything out there's any good.

36:53.440 --> 36:54.200
 And I was like, awesome.

36:54.200 --> 36:55.880
 At that point, I was like, we're starting a company.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.600
 Because I couldn't have whooshed for a better person

36:58.600 --> 37:01.000
 to walk through the door and say, I'm excited about this,

37:01.000 --> 37:01.560
 too.

37:01.560 --> 37:02.360
 Same thing with Joel, right?

37:02.360 --> 37:04.000
 I mean, Joel is a legend in the industry, right?

37:04.000 --> 37:04.760
 So when he walked through and said,

37:04.760 --> 37:06.960
 I'm excited about this problem, I was like, me too, man.

37:06.960 --> 37:08.200
 We can do this, right?

37:08.200 --> 37:10.600
 So that, to me, is the most important step.

37:10.600 --> 37:12.840
 It's like, having an idea you're super excited about,

37:12.840 --> 37:14.640
 and another person, a cofounder, right?

37:14.640 --> 37:16.760
 Because again, you get that dual leadership, right?

37:16.760 --> 37:19.120
 Am I making a bad decision?

37:19.120 --> 37:21.500
 Sometimes it's nice to have checks of like,

37:21.500 --> 37:22.440
 is this a good idea?

37:22.440 --> 37:23.680
 I don't know, right?

37:23.680 --> 37:25.600
 So those are the crucial seeds.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.520
 But then starting to build stuff,

37:27.520 --> 37:28.360
 whether it's you programming or somebody else's.

37:28.360 --> 37:29.360
 There is prototyping.

37:29.360 --> 37:30.600
 So there's tons of research.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.880
 There's tons of research, like, what's out there that failed?

37:32.880 --> 37:34.360
 Because a lot of people look at the successes.

37:34.360 --> 37:36.080
 Oh, look at how successful X is.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.360
 Everybody looks at the successes.

37:37.360 --> 37:38.360
 Those are boring.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.860
 Show me the failures, because that is what's interesting.

37:40.860 --> 37:42.080
 That's where people were experimenting.

37:42.080 --> 37:43.960
 That's where people were pushing.

37:43.960 --> 37:45.560
 And they failed, but they probably

37:45.560 --> 37:47.480
 failed for reasons that weren't directly

37:47.480 --> 37:50.040
 about the quality of their idea, right?

37:50.040 --> 37:51.400
 So look at all the failures.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.200
 Don't just look what everybody looks at, which is like, oh,

37:53.200 --> 37:54.620
 gosh, look at all these successful people.

37:54.620 --> 37:55.920
 Look at the failures.

37:55.920 --> 37:57.240
 Look at the things that didn't work.

37:57.240 --> 37:59.040
 Research the entire field.

37:59.040 --> 38:01.440
 And so that's the research that I was doing

38:01.440 --> 38:02.720
 that led me to Robin, right?

38:02.720 --> 38:03.560
 Was that.

38:03.560 --> 38:07.520
 And then when we, for example, when we did Stack Overflow,

38:07.520 --> 38:08.960
 we're like, okay, well, I really like elements

38:08.960 --> 38:10.000
 of voting and dig and read it.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.760
 I like the Wikipedia, everything's up to date.

38:12.760 --> 38:14.280
 Nothing is like an old tombstone

38:14.280 --> 38:16.940
 that has horrible out of date information.

38:16.940 --> 38:17.780
 We know that works.

38:17.780 --> 38:19.360
 Wikipedia is an amazing resource.

38:19.360 --> 38:22.360
 Blogging, the idea of ownership is so powerful, right?

38:22.360 --> 38:23.960
 Like, oh, I, Joe wrote this,

38:23.960 --> 38:26.200
 and look how good Joe's answer is, right?

38:26.200 --> 38:27.720
 All these concepts were rolling together.

38:27.720 --> 38:29.040
 Researching all the things that were out there

38:29.040 --> 38:30.600
 that were working and why they were working

38:30.600 --> 38:32.360
 and trying to fold them into, again,

38:32.360 --> 38:35.280
 that Frankenstein's monster of what Stack Overflow is.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.040
 And by the way, that wasn't a free decision

38:37.040 --> 38:38.720
 because there's still a ton of tension

38:38.720 --> 38:40.000
 in the Stack Overflow system.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.560
 There's reasons people complain about Stack Overflow

38:42.560 --> 38:43.640
 because it's so strict, right?

38:43.640 --> 38:44.640
 Why is it so strict?

38:44.640 --> 38:46.480
 Why are you guys always closing my questions?

38:46.480 --> 38:47.880
 It's because there's so much tension

38:47.880 --> 38:49.120
 that we built into the system

38:49.120 --> 38:51.880
 around trying to get good, good results out of the system.

38:51.880 --> 38:56.000
 And it's not a free.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.520
 That stuff doesn't come for free, right?

38:57.520 --> 38:59.800
 It's not like we, we all have perfect answers

38:59.800 --> 39:02.280
 and nobody will have to get their feelings heard

39:02.280 --> 39:04.560
 or nobody will have to get downvoted.

39:04.560 --> 39:06.640
 It doesn't work that way, right?

39:06.640 --> 39:09.400
 So this is an interesting point and a small tangent.

39:09.400 --> 39:12.000
 You write about anxiety.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.040
 So I've posted a lot of questions

39:14.040 --> 39:16.040
 and written answers on Stack Overflow.

39:16.040 --> 39:18.320
 On the question side, you usually go to

39:18.320 --> 39:21.160
 something very specific to something I'm working on.

39:21.160 --> 39:22.280
 And this is something you talk about

39:22.280 --> 39:26.120
 that really the goal of Stack Overflow isn't about,

39:26.120 --> 39:29.360
 is to write a question that's not about you,

39:29.360 --> 39:33.480
 it's about the question that will help

39:33.480 --> 39:35.800
 the community in the future.

39:35.800 --> 39:37.520
 Right, but that's a tough sell, right?

39:37.520 --> 39:39.160
 Because people are like, well,

39:39.160 --> 39:40.280
 I don't really care about the community.

39:40.280 --> 39:41.520
 What I care about is my problem.

39:41.520 --> 39:43.400
 And that's fair, right?

39:43.400 --> 39:44.880
 It's sort of that, again, that tension,

39:44.880 --> 39:46.680
 that balancing act of we wanna help you,

39:46.680 --> 39:48.640
 but we also wanna help everybody that comes behind you.

39:48.640 --> 39:49.880
 The long line of people are gonna come up and say,

39:49.880 --> 39:52.240
 oh, I kinda have that problem too, right?

39:52.240 --> 39:54.040
 And if nobody's ever gonna come up and say,

39:54.040 --> 39:54.880
 I have this problem too,

39:54.880 --> 39:57.000
 then that question shouldn't exist on Stack Overflow

39:57.000 --> 39:58.840
 because the question is too specific.

39:58.840 --> 40:00.040
 And even that's tension, right?

40:00.040 --> 40:00.880
 How do you judge that?

40:00.880 --> 40:02.600
 How do you know that nobody's ever gonna have

40:02.600 --> 40:04.680
 this particular question again?

40:04.680 --> 40:06.800
 So there's a lot of tension in the system.

40:06.800 --> 40:09.560
 Do you think that anxiety of asking the question,

40:09.560 --> 40:11.560
 the anxiety of answering,

40:11.560 --> 40:14.200
 that tension is inherent to programmers,

40:14.200 --> 40:16.960
 is inherent to this kind of process?

40:16.960 --> 40:20.320
 Or can it be improved?

40:20.320 --> 40:22.440
 Can it be happy land

40:22.440 --> 40:25.820
 where that tension is not quite so harsh?

40:26.880 --> 40:28.120
 I don't think Stack Overflow

40:28.120 --> 40:30.040
 can totally change the way it works.

40:30.040 --> 40:31.800
 One thing they are working on finally

40:31.800 --> 40:35.200
 is the ask page had not changed since 2011.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.760
 I'm still kind of bitter about this

40:36.760 --> 40:39.360
 because I feel like you have a Q&A system

40:39.360 --> 40:41.400
 and what are the core pages in a Q&A system?

40:41.400 --> 40:42.240
 Well, first of all, the question,

40:42.240 --> 40:43.760
 all the answers and also the ask page,

40:43.760 --> 40:45.120
 particularly when you're a new user

40:45.120 --> 40:46.520
 or someone trying to ask a question,

40:46.520 --> 40:48.400
 that's the point at which you need the most help.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.760
 And we just didn't adapt with the times.

40:50.760 --> 40:52.320
 But the good news is they're working on this,

40:52.320 --> 40:53.200
 from what I understand,

40:53.200 --> 40:55.180
 and it's gonna be a more wizard based format.

40:55.180 --> 40:56.820
 And you could envision a world

40:56.820 --> 40:58.420
 where as part of this wizard based program,

40:58.420 --> 40:59.360
 when you're asking questions,

40:59.360 --> 41:01.080
 okay, come up with a good title,

41:01.080 --> 41:02.560
 what are good words to put in the title?

41:02.560 --> 41:04.280
 One word that's not good to put in the title

41:04.280 --> 41:05.880
 is problem, for example.

41:05.880 --> 41:06.700
 I have a problem.

41:06.700 --> 41:07.760
 Oh, you have a problem.

41:07.760 --> 41:10.400
 Okay, a problem, that's great.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.400
 You need specifics.

41:11.400 --> 41:13.440
 So it's trying to help you make a good question title,

41:13.440 --> 41:17.280
 for example, that step will be broken out, all that stuff.

41:17.280 --> 41:19.560
 But one of those steps in that wizard of asking

41:19.560 --> 41:21.600
 could say, hey, I'm a little nervous.

41:21.600 --> 41:22.660
 I've never done this before.

41:22.660 --> 41:26.080
 Can you put me in a queue for special mentoring?

41:26.080 --> 41:27.560
 You could opt in to a special mentor.

41:27.560 --> 41:28.960
 I think that would be fantastic.

41:28.960 --> 41:31.360
 I don't have any objection to that at all

41:31.360 --> 41:32.600
 in terms of being an opt in system.

41:32.600 --> 41:33.920
 Because there are people that are like,

41:33.920 --> 41:35.480
 I just wanna help them.

41:35.480 --> 41:36.720
 I wanna help a person no matter what.

41:36.720 --> 41:37.920
 I wanna go above and beyond.

41:37.920 --> 41:40.160
 I wanna spend hours with this person.

41:41.320 --> 41:42.960
 It depends what their goals are.

41:42.960 --> 41:43.780
 It's a great idea.

41:43.780 --> 41:44.620
 Who am I to judge?

41:44.620 --> 41:45.460
 So that's fine.

41:45.460 --> 41:47.320
 It's not precluded from happening.

41:47.320 --> 41:49.000
 But there's a certain big city ethos

41:49.000 --> 41:49.840
 that we started with.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.080
 Like, look, we're in New York City.

41:51.080 --> 41:52.040
 You don't come to New York City

41:52.040 --> 41:54.360
 and expect them to be, oh, welcome to the city, Joe.

41:54.360 --> 41:55.200
 How's it going?

41:55.200 --> 41:56.020
 Come on in.

41:56.020 --> 41:57.120
 Let me show you around.

41:57.120 --> 41:58.920
 That's not how New York City works.

42:01.480 --> 42:03.060
 Again, New York City has a reputation for being rude,

42:03.060 --> 42:04.080
 which I actually don't think it is,

42:04.080 --> 42:05.240
 having been there fairly recently.

42:05.240 --> 42:06.080
 It's not rude.

42:06.080 --> 42:07.240
 It's just like going about their business.

42:07.240 --> 42:08.980
 Like, look, I have things to do.

42:08.980 --> 42:09.820
 I'm busy.

42:09.820 --> 42:11.840
 I'm a busy professional, as are you.

42:11.840 --> 42:13.440
 And since you're a busy professional,

42:13.440 --> 42:14.680
 certainly when you ask a question,

42:14.680 --> 42:16.440
 you're gonna ask the best possible question.

42:16.440 --> 42:18.220
 Because you're a busy professional

42:18.220 --> 42:20.160
 and you would not accept anything less

42:20.160 --> 42:21.420
 than a very well written question

42:21.420 --> 42:23.280
 with a lot of detail about why you're doing it,

42:23.280 --> 42:25.060
 what you're doing, what you researched,

42:25.060 --> 42:26.200
 what you found,

42:26.200 --> 42:28.600
 because you're a professional like me.

42:28.600 --> 42:31.000
 And this rubs people sometimes the wrong way.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.320
 And I don't think it's wrong to say,

42:32.320 --> 42:33.680
 look, I don't want that experience.

42:33.680 --> 42:37.600
 I want just a more chill place for beginners.

42:37.600 --> 42:39.160
 And I still think Stack Overflow

42:39.160 --> 42:41.960
 is not, was never designed for beginners, right?

42:41.960 --> 42:43.840
 There's this misconception that,

42:43.840 --> 42:44.800
 even Joel says sometimes,

42:44.800 --> 42:46.120
 oh yeah, Stack Overflow for beginners.

42:46.120 --> 42:48.840
 And I think if you're a prodigy, it can be.

42:48.840 --> 42:49.660
 Right.

42:49.660 --> 42:50.500
 But for the most part, not.

42:50.500 --> 42:51.760
 But that's not really representative, right?

42:51.760 --> 42:53.060
 Like, I think as a beginner,

42:53.060 --> 42:55.120
 you want a totally different set of tools.

42:55.120 --> 42:58.060
 You want like live screen sharing, live chat.

42:58.060 --> 42:59.220
 You want access to resources.

42:59.220 --> 43:00.260
 You want a playground,

43:00.260 --> 43:02.360
 like a playground you can experiment in

43:02.360 --> 43:04.480
 and like test and all this stuff

43:04.480 --> 43:05.640
 that we just don't give people

43:05.640 --> 43:07.780
 because that was never really the audience

43:07.780 --> 43:09.280
 that we were designing Stack Overflow for.

43:09.280 --> 43:10.680
 That doesn't mean it's wrong.

43:10.680 --> 43:11.800
 And I think it would be awesome

43:11.800 --> 43:13.280
 if there was a site like that on the internet,

43:13.280 --> 43:14.320
 or if Stack Overflow said,

43:14.320 --> 43:15.800
 hey, you know, we're gonna start doing this.

43:15.800 --> 43:16.960
 That's fine too.

43:16.960 --> 43:17.800
 You know, I'm not there.

43:17.800 --> 43:18.680
 I'm not making those decisions.

43:18.680 --> 43:20.640
 But I do think the pressure,

43:20.640 --> 43:22.800
 the tension that you described is there for people to be,

43:22.800 --> 43:24.480
 look, I'm a little nervous

43:24.480 --> 43:26.400
 because I know I gotta do my best work, right?

43:26.400 --> 43:28.040
 The other one is something you talk about,

43:28.040 --> 43:30.320
 which is also really interesting to me,

43:30.320 --> 43:35.320
 is duplicate questions or it's a really difficult problem

43:37.160 --> 43:38.080
 that you highlight.

43:38.080 --> 43:39.480
 It's super hard.

43:39.480 --> 43:41.720
 Like you could take one little topic

43:41.720 --> 43:44.960
 and you could probably write 10, 20, 30 ways

43:44.960 --> 43:46.640
 of asking about that topic

43:46.640 --> 43:48.220
 and there will be all different.

43:48.220 --> 43:50.200
 I don't know if there should be one page

43:50.200 --> 43:51.880
 that answers all of it.

43:51.880 --> 43:56.880
 Is there a way that Stack Overflow can help disambiguate,

43:56.880 --> 44:01.160
 like separate these duplicate questions

44:01.160 --> 44:02.820
 or connect them together?

44:02.820 --> 44:06.220
 Or is it a totally hopeless, difficult, impossible task?

44:06.220 --> 44:08.480
 I think it's a very, very hard computer science problem.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.280
 And partly because people are very good

44:10.280 --> 44:11.760
 at using completely different words.

44:11.760 --> 44:13.160
 It always amazed me on Stack Overflow.

44:13.160 --> 44:15.440
 You'd have two questions that were functionally identical

44:15.440 --> 44:17.520
 and one question had like zero words in common

44:17.520 --> 44:18.360
 with the other question.

44:18.360 --> 44:20.920
 Like, oh my God, from a computer science perspective,

44:20.920 --> 44:22.960
 how do you even begin to solve that?

44:22.960 --> 44:24.480
 And it happens all the time.

44:24.480 --> 44:26.280
 People are super good at this, right?

44:26.280 --> 44:28.360
 Accidentally at asking the same thing

44:28.360 --> 44:31.200
 in like 10, 20 different ways.

44:31.200 --> 44:32.760
 And the other complexity is we want some

44:32.760 --> 44:33.900
 of those duplicates to exist

44:33.900 --> 44:36.000
 because if there's five versions with different words,

44:36.000 --> 44:37.280
 have those five versions point

44:37.280 --> 44:39.560
 to the one centralized answer, right?

44:39.560 --> 44:41.880
 It's like, okay, this is a duplicate, no worries.

44:41.880 --> 44:43.460
 Here's the answer that you wanted over here

44:43.460 --> 44:48.000
 on the prime example that we want to have,

44:48.000 --> 44:50.680
 rather than having 10 copies of the question and the answer.

44:50.680 --> 44:52.400
 Because if you have 10 copies of the question and answer,

44:52.400 --> 44:54.120
 this also devalues the reputation system,

44:54.120 --> 44:56.880
 which programmers hate, as I previously mentioned.

44:56.880 --> 44:58.320
 You're getting reputation for an answer

44:58.320 --> 44:59.320
 that somebody else already gave.

44:59.320 --> 45:00.440
 It's like, well, it's an answer,

45:00.440 --> 45:02.200
 but somebody else already gave that answer.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.560
 So why are you getting reputation for the same answer

45:04.560 --> 45:06.480
 as the other guy who gave it four years ago?

45:06.480 --> 45:07.760
 People get offended by that, right?

45:07.760 --> 45:11.920
 So the reputation system itself adds tension to the system

45:11.920 --> 45:14.040
 in that the people who have a lot of reputation

45:14.040 --> 45:17.600
 become very incentivized to enforce the reputation system.

45:17.600 --> 45:18.920
 And for the most part, that's good.

45:18.920 --> 45:20.520
 I know it sounds weird, but for most parts,

45:20.520 --> 45:23.880
 like look, strict systems, I think to use Stack Overflow,

45:23.880 --> 45:26.000
 you have to have the idea that, OK, strict systems ultimately

45:26.000 --> 45:26.720
 work better.

45:26.720 --> 45:28.440
 And I do think in programming, you're

45:28.440 --> 45:31.320
 familiar with loose typing versus strict typing, right?

45:31.320 --> 45:33.000
 The idea that you can declare a variable,

45:33.000 --> 45:34.840
 not declare a variable, rather, just start using a variable.

45:34.840 --> 45:36.280
 And OK, I see it's implicitly an integer.

45:36.280 --> 45:37.200
 Bam, awesome.

45:37.200 --> 45:38.120
 Duck equals 5.

45:38.120 --> 45:40.360
 Well, duck is now an integer of 5, right?

45:40.360 --> 45:42.320
 And you're like, cool, awesome, simpler, right?

45:42.320 --> 45:43.840
 Why would I want to worry about typing?

45:43.840 --> 45:45.800
 And for a long time, in the Ruby community,

45:45.800 --> 45:46.920
 they're like, yeah, this is awesome.

45:46.920 --> 45:48.320
 You just do a bunch of unit testing,

45:48.320 --> 45:50.960
 which is testing your program's validity after the fact

45:50.960 --> 45:54.160
 to catch any bugs that strict typing of variables

45:54.160 --> 45:55.040
 would have caught.

45:55.040 --> 45:56.080
 And now you have this thing called

45:56.080 --> 45:58.080
 TypeScript for Microsoft from the guy who

45:58.080 --> 46:01.120
 built C Sharp Anders, who's one of the greatest

46:01.120 --> 46:02.840
 minds in software development, right,

46:02.840 --> 46:04.480
 like in terms of language design.

46:04.480 --> 46:06.560
 And says, no, no, no, we want to bolt on a strict type

46:06.560 --> 46:08.200
 system to JavaScript because it makes things better.

46:08.200 --> 46:11.480
 And now everybody's like, oh my god, we deployed TypeScript

46:11.480 --> 46:14.480
 and found 50 latent bugs that we didn't know about, right?

46:14.480 --> 46:15.840
 Like, this is super common.

46:15.840 --> 46:19.960
 So I think there is a truth in programming

46:19.960 --> 46:22.280
 that strictness, it's not the goal.

46:22.280 --> 46:25.720
 We're not saying be super strict because strictness is correct.

46:25.720 --> 46:26.600
 No, it's no, no.

46:26.600 --> 46:28.640
 Strictness produces better results.

46:28.640 --> 46:29.880
 That's what I'm saying, right?

46:29.880 --> 46:32.000
 So strict typing of variables, I would

46:32.000 --> 46:33.920
 say you almost universally have consensus now

46:33.920 --> 46:35.440
 is basically correct.

46:35.440 --> 46:37.720
 Should be that way in every language, right?

46:37.720 --> 46:39.480
 Duck equals five should generate an error

46:39.480 --> 46:40.720
 because no, you didn't declare.

46:40.720 --> 46:42.960
 You didn't tell me that duck was an integer, right?

46:42.960 --> 46:43.840
 That's a bug, right?

46:43.840 --> 46:44.720
 Or maybe you mistyped.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.480
 You typed deck instead of duck, right?

46:46.480 --> 46:47.120
 You never know.

46:47.120 --> 46:48.840
 This happens all the time, right?

46:48.840 --> 46:51.600
 So with that in mind, I will say that the strictness

46:51.600 --> 46:52.720
 of the system is correct.

46:52.720 --> 46:53.960
 Now, that doesn't mean cruel.

46:53.960 --> 46:55.040
 That doesn't mean mean.

46:55.040 --> 46:56.080
 That doesn't mean angry.

46:56.080 --> 46:57.560
 It just means strict, OK?

46:57.560 --> 46:59.280
 So I think where there's misunderstanding

46:59.280 --> 47:00.720
 is people get cranky, right?

47:00.720 --> 47:03.920
 Like, another question you asked is like, why are programmers

47:03.920 --> 47:05.160
 kind of mean sometimes?

47:05.160 --> 47:07.480
 Well, who do programmers work with all day long?

47:07.480 --> 47:10.080
 So I have a theory that if you're at a job

47:10.080 --> 47:12.440
 and you work with assholes all day long,

47:12.440 --> 47:14.400
 what do you eventually become?

47:14.400 --> 47:15.000
 An asshole.

47:15.000 --> 47:15.800
 An asshole.

47:15.800 --> 47:19.280
 And what is the computer except the world's biggest asshole?

47:19.280 --> 47:21.800
 Because the computer has no time for your bullshit.

47:21.800 --> 47:24.040
 The computer, the minute you make a mistake,

47:24.040 --> 47:25.480
 everything is crashing down, right?

47:25.480 --> 47:28.160
 One semicolon has crashed space missions, right?

47:28.160 --> 47:29.040
 So that's normal.

47:29.040 --> 47:30.640
 So you begin to internalize that.

47:30.640 --> 47:34.640
 You begin to think, oh, my coworker, the computer,

47:34.640 --> 47:37.520
 is super strict and kind of a jerk about everything.

47:37.520 --> 47:40.000
 So that's kind of how I'm going to be.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.840
 Because I work with this computer,

47:41.840 --> 47:44.600
 and I have to exceed to its terms on everything.

47:44.600 --> 47:46.400
 So therefore, you start to absorb that.

47:46.400 --> 47:49.400
 You start to think, oh, well, being really strict arbitrarily

47:49.400 --> 47:50.440
 is really good.

47:50.440 --> 47:54.120
 An error of error code 56249 is a completely good error message

47:54.120 --> 47:56.120
 because that's what the computer gave me, right?

47:56.120 --> 47:59.440
 So you kind of forget to be a person at some level.

47:59.440 --> 48:02.200
 And you know how they say great detectives internalize

48:02.200 --> 48:04.200
 criminals and kind of are criminals themselves,

48:04.200 --> 48:06.700
 like this trope of the master detective

48:06.700 --> 48:08.720
 is good because he can think like the criminal.

48:08.720 --> 48:10.520
 Well, I do think that's true of programmers.

48:10.520 --> 48:12.720
 Really good programmers think like the computer

48:12.720 --> 48:14.200
 because that's their job.

48:14.200 --> 48:17.080
 But if you internalize it too much, you become the computer.

48:17.080 --> 48:19.560
 You kind of become a jerk to everybody

48:19.560 --> 48:21.720
 because that's what you've internalized.

48:21.720 --> 48:24.240
 You're almost not a jerk, but you have no patience

48:24.240 --> 48:26.240
 for a lack of strictness, as you said.

48:26.240 --> 48:27.840
 It's not out of a sense of meanness.

48:27.840 --> 48:28.640
 It's accidental.

48:28.640 --> 48:30.400
 But I do believe it's an occupational hazard

48:30.400 --> 48:32.000
 of being a programmer is you start

48:32.000 --> 48:33.760
 to behave like the computer.

48:33.760 --> 48:34.800
 You're very unforgiving.

48:34.800 --> 48:35.920
 You're very terse.

48:35.920 --> 48:38.400
 You're very, oh, wrong, incorrect, move on.

48:38.400 --> 48:40.040
 It's like, well, can you help me?

48:40.040 --> 48:41.240
 What could I do to fix?

48:41.240 --> 48:44.000
 No, wrong, next question.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.440
 Like, that's normal for the computer.

48:46.440 --> 48:49.280
 Just fail, next.

48:49.280 --> 48:51.600
 I don't know if you remember in Saturday Night Live,

48:51.600 --> 48:54.640
 in the 90s, they had this character who was an IT guy.

48:54.640 --> 48:55.520
 The move guy.

48:55.520 --> 48:56.040
 Move.

48:56.040 --> 48:56.720
 Move.

48:56.720 --> 48:58.080
 Was that Jimmy Fallon?

48:58.080 --> 48:58.640
 No.

48:58.640 --> 48:59.760
 No.

48:59.760 --> 49:01.160
 Who played him?

49:01.160 --> 49:02.120
 OK, yeah, I remember.

49:02.120 --> 49:02.620
 Move.

49:02.620 --> 49:03.120
 Right.

49:03.120 --> 49:04.160
 He had no patience for it.

49:04.160 --> 49:05.720
 Might have been Mad TV, actually.

49:05.720 --> 49:06.680
 Wasn't it Mad TV?

49:06.680 --> 49:07.600
 Might have been.

49:07.600 --> 49:10.940
 But anyway, that's always been the perception.

49:10.940 --> 49:12.560
 You start to behave like the computer.

49:12.560 --> 49:14.880
 It's like, oh, you're wrong, out of the way, you know?

49:14.880 --> 49:17.560
 You've written so many blog posts about programming,

49:17.560 --> 49:22.720
 about programs, programming, programmers.

49:22.720 --> 49:26.920
 What do you think makes a good, let's start with,

49:26.920 --> 49:29.360
 what makes a good solo programmer?

49:29.360 --> 49:31.600
 Well, I don't think you should be a solo programmer.

49:31.600 --> 49:33.400
 I think to be a good solo programmer,

49:33.400 --> 49:35.800
 it's kind of like what I talked about, well, not on Mike,

49:35.800 --> 49:39.240
 but one of the things John Carmack, one of the best

49:39.240 --> 49:41.120
 points he makes in the book Masters of Doom, which

49:41.120 --> 49:43.200
 is a fantastic book, and anybody listening to this

49:43.200 --> 49:44.700
 who hasn't read it, please read it.

49:44.700 --> 49:47.400
 It's such a great book, is that at the time,

49:47.400 --> 49:50.720
 they were working on stuff like Wolfenstein and Doom.

49:50.720 --> 49:52.780
 They didn't have the resources that we have today.

49:52.780 --> 49:53.940
 They didn't have Stack Overflow.

49:53.940 --> 49:54.860
 They didn't have Wikipedia.

49:54.860 --> 49:56.680
 They didn't have discourse forums.

49:56.680 --> 50:00.200
 They didn't have places to go to get people to help them.

50:00.200 --> 50:01.880
 They had to work on their own.

50:01.880 --> 50:03.760
 And that's why it took a genius like Carmack

50:03.760 --> 50:05.120
 to do this stuff, because you had

50:05.120 --> 50:07.160
 to be a genius to invent from first principles.

50:07.160 --> 50:09.560
 A lot of the stuff he was like, the hacks he was coming up

50:09.560 --> 50:11.900
 with were genius, genius level stuff.

50:11.900 --> 50:13.880
 But you don't need to be a genius anymore,

50:13.880 --> 50:15.540
 and that means not working by yourself.

50:15.540 --> 50:17.420
 You have to be good at researching stuff online.

50:17.420 --> 50:19.680
 You have to be good at asking questions, really good

50:19.680 --> 50:21.440
 questions that are really well researched, which implies,

50:21.440 --> 50:23.080
 oh, I went out and researched for three hours

50:23.080 --> 50:24.240
 before I wrote these questions.

50:24.240 --> 50:26.200
 That's what you should be doing, because that's

50:26.200 --> 50:28.160
 what's going to make you good.

50:28.160 --> 50:29.360
 To me, this is the big difference

50:29.360 --> 50:32.120
 between programming in the 80s versus programming today,

50:32.120 --> 50:35.040
 is you kind of had to be by yourself back then.

50:35.040 --> 50:36.560
 Where would you go for answers?

50:36.560 --> 50:38.060
 I remember in the early days when

50:38.060 --> 50:41.320
 I was learning Visual Basic for Windows,

50:41.320 --> 50:44.600
 I would call the Microsoft Helpline on the phone

50:44.600 --> 50:45.680
 when I had programming.

50:45.680 --> 50:47.040
 Because I was like, I don't know what to do.

50:47.040 --> 50:49.640
 So I would go and call, and they had these huge phone banks.

50:49.640 --> 50:51.480
 And I'm like, can you imagine how alien that is now?

50:51.480 --> 50:52.480
 Who would do that?

50:52.480 --> 50:53.560
 That's crazy.

50:53.560 --> 50:57.720
 So there was just nowhere else to go when you got stuck.

50:57.720 --> 50:59.560
 I had the books that came with it.

50:59.560 --> 51:01.320
 I read those, studied those religiously.

51:01.320 --> 51:03.320
 I just saw a post from Steve Sanofsky

51:03.320 --> 51:08.880
 that said the C++ version 7 came with 10,000 pages

51:08.880 --> 51:10.640
 of written material.

51:10.640 --> 51:13.600
 Because where else were you going to figure that stuff out?

51:13.600 --> 51:14.640
 Go to the library?

51:14.640 --> 51:16.100
 I mean, you didn't have Wikipedia.

51:16.100 --> 51:17.880
 You didn't have Reddit.

51:17.880 --> 51:20.760
 You didn't have anywhere to go to answer these questions.

51:20.760 --> 51:24.160
 So you've talked about, through the years,

51:24.160 --> 51:26.200
 basically not having an ego and not

51:26.200 --> 51:29.920
 thinking that you're the best programmer in the world.

51:29.920 --> 51:34.040
 So always kind of just looking to improve,

51:34.040 --> 51:36.520
 to become a better programmer than you were yesterday.

51:36.520 --> 51:39.160
 So how have you changed as a programmer

51:39.160 --> 51:43.280
 and as a thinker, designer around programming

51:43.280 --> 51:47.600
 over the past, what is it, 15 years, really,

51:47.600 --> 51:48.960
 of being a public figure?

51:48.960 --> 51:51.960
 I would say the big insight that I had is, eventually,

51:51.960 --> 51:54.000
 as a programmer, you have to stop writing code

51:54.000 --> 51:56.880
 to be effective, which is kind of disturbing.

51:56.880 --> 51:58.240
 Because you really love it.

51:58.240 --> 52:01.600
 But you realize being effective at programming,

52:01.600 --> 52:03.960
 at programming in the general sense,

52:03.960 --> 52:05.120
 doesn't mean writing code.

52:05.120 --> 52:07.000
 And a lot of times, you can be much more successful by not

52:07.000 --> 52:09.840
 writing code and writing code in terms of just solving

52:09.840 --> 52:11.680
 the problems you have, essentially hiring people

52:11.680 --> 52:13.780
 that are really good and setting them free

52:13.780 --> 52:18.000
 and giving them basic direction on strategy and stuff.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.680
 Because a lot of the problems you encounter

52:19.680 --> 52:22.360
 aren't necessarily solved through really gnarly code.

52:22.360 --> 52:25.720
 They're solved by conceptual solutions, which can then

52:25.720 --> 52:26.520
 be turned into code.

52:26.520 --> 52:29.720
 But are you even solving the right problem?

52:29.720 --> 52:32.880
 So I would say, for me, the main insight I have

52:32.880 --> 52:36.080
 is, to succeed as a programmer, you eventually

52:36.080 --> 52:37.560
 kind of stop writing code.

52:37.560 --> 52:39.160
 That's going to sound discouraging, probably,

52:39.160 --> 52:39.680
 to people hearing.

52:39.680 --> 52:40.760
 But I don't mean it that way.

52:40.760 --> 52:42.120
 What I mean is that you're coding

52:42.120 --> 52:43.360
 at a higher level language.

52:43.360 --> 52:45.600
 Eventually, like, OK, so we're coding in assembly language.

52:45.600 --> 52:46.800
 That's the beginning, right?

52:46.800 --> 52:48.960
 You're hardcoded to the architecture.

52:48.960 --> 52:50.280
 Then you have stuff like C, where it's like, wow,

52:50.280 --> 52:52.080
 we can abstract across the architecture.

52:52.080 --> 52:52.880
 We can write code.

52:52.880 --> 52:54.640
 I can then compile that code for ARM

52:54.640 --> 52:58.400
 or whatever x86 or whatever else is out there.

52:58.400 --> 53:00.600
 And then even higher level than that,

53:00.600 --> 53:03.160
 you're looking at Python, Ruby, interpreted languages.

53:03.160 --> 53:04.680
 And then, to me, as a programmer,

53:04.680 --> 53:06.000
 I'm like, OK, I want to go even higher.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.200
 I want to go higher than that.

53:07.200 --> 53:08.560
 How do I abstract higher than the language?

53:08.560 --> 53:11.120
 It's like, well, you abstract in spoken language

53:11.120 --> 53:12.560
 and written language, right?

53:12.560 --> 53:14.640
 You're sort of inspiring people to get things done,

53:14.640 --> 53:16.080
 giving them guidance, like, what if we did this?

53:16.080 --> 53:17.240
 What if we did this?

53:17.240 --> 53:19.120
 You're writing in the highest level language

53:19.120 --> 53:21.360
 that there is, which is, for me, English,

53:21.360 --> 53:23.120
 whatever your spoken language is.

53:23.120 --> 53:25.960
 So it's all about being effective, right?

53:25.960 --> 53:31.000
 And I think Patrick McKenzie, patio11 on Hacker News

53:31.000 --> 53:33.600
 and works at Stripe, has a great post about this,

53:33.600 --> 53:35.880
 of how calling yourself a programmer

53:35.880 --> 53:38.160
 is a career limiting move at some level

53:38.160 --> 53:39.800
 once you get far enough from your career.

53:39.800 --> 53:40.800
 And I really believe that.

53:40.800 --> 53:41.840
 And again, I apologize.

53:41.840 --> 53:43.080
 This is sound discouraging.

53:43.080 --> 53:45.240
 I don't mean it to be, but he's so right.

53:45.240 --> 53:47.720
 Because all the stuff that goes on around the code,

53:47.720 --> 53:49.760
 like the people, that's another thing,

53:49.760 --> 53:52.200
 if you look at my early blog entries, is about, wow,

53:52.200 --> 53:54.720
 programming is about people more than it's

53:54.720 --> 53:56.680
 about code, which doesn't really make sense.

53:56.680 --> 53:59.160
 But it's about, can these people even get along together?

53:59.160 --> 54:00.720
 Can they understand each other?

54:00.720 --> 54:03.000
 Can you even explain to me what it is you're working on?

54:03.000 --> 54:04.560
 Are you solving the right problem?

54:04.560 --> 54:06.600
 PeopleWare, another classic programming book,

54:06.600 --> 54:08.480
 which, again, up there with Code Complete,

54:08.480 --> 54:09.960
 please read PeopleWare.

54:09.960 --> 54:11.560
 It's that software is people.

54:11.560 --> 54:13.440
 People are the software, first and foremost.

54:13.440 --> 54:15.860
 So a lot of the skills that I was working on early

54:15.860 --> 54:18.560
 in the blog were about figuring out the people

54:18.560 --> 54:20.680
 parts of programming, which were the harder parts.

54:20.680 --> 54:21.880
 The hard part of programming, once you

54:21.880 --> 54:23.040
 get a certain skill level in programming,

54:23.040 --> 54:25.360
 you can pretty much solve any reasonable problem that's

54:25.360 --> 54:26.320
 put in front of you.

54:26.320 --> 54:28.120
 You're not writing algorithms from scratch.

54:28.120 --> 54:29.280
 That just doesn't happen.

54:29.280 --> 54:31.360
 So any sort of reasonable problem put in front of you,

54:31.360 --> 54:32.760
 you're going to be able to solve.

54:32.760 --> 54:36.920
 But what you can't solve is, our manager is a total jerk.

54:36.920 --> 54:38.600
 You cannot solve that with code.

54:38.600 --> 54:40.800
 That is not a code solvable problem.

54:40.800 --> 54:44.040
 And yet, that will cripple you way more than, oh, we

54:44.040 --> 54:45.800
 had to use this stupid framework I don't like,

54:45.800 --> 54:49.320
 or Sam keeps writing bad code that I hate,

54:49.320 --> 54:52.440
 or Dave is off there in the wilderness writing

54:52.440 --> 54:53.280
 God knows what.

54:53.280 --> 54:54.440
 These are not your problems.

54:54.440 --> 54:56.800
 Your problem is your manager or a co worker

54:56.800 --> 54:58.760
 is so toxic to everybody else in your team

54:58.760 --> 55:00.080
 that nobody can get anything done,

55:00.080 --> 55:02.320
 because everybody's so stressed out and freaked out.

55:02.320 --> 55:04.520
 These are the problems that you have to attack.

55:04.520 --> 55:05.040
 Absolutely.

55:05.040 --> 55:07.360
 And so as you go to these higher level abstractions,

55:07.360 --> 55:09.060
 as you've developed as a programmer

55:09.060 --> 55:10.600
 to higher and higher level abstractions

55:10.600 --> 55:12.680
 and go into natural language, you're

55:12.680 --> 55:17.560
 also the guy who preached building it, diving in

55:17.560 --> 55:21.720
 and doing it, and learn by doing.

55:21.720 --> 55:22.840
 Yes.

55:22.840 --> 55:29.120
 Do you worry that as you get to higher and higher level

55:29.120 --> 55:34.320
 abstractions, you lose track of the lower level of just

55:34.320 --> 55:35.880
 building?

55:35.880 --> 55:38.560
 Do you worry about that, even not maybe now,

55:38.560 --> 55:41.560
 but 10 years from now, 20 years from now?

55:41.560 --> 55:42.480
 Well, no.

55:42.480 --> 55:44.360
 I mean, there is always that paranoia around, oh, gosh,

55:44.360 --> 55:46.240
 I don't feel it's valuable since I'm not writing code.

55:46.240 --> 55:48.280
 But for me, when we started the discourse project,

55:48.280 --> 55:50.280
 it was Ruby, which I didn't really know Ruby.

55:50.280 --> 55:51.840
 I mean, as you pointed out, and this

55:51.840 --> 55:53.840
 is another valuable observation in Stack Overflow,

55:53.840 --> 55:56.040
 you can be super proficient in, for example, C Sharp,

55:56.040 --> 55:56.760
 which I was working in.

55:56.760 --> 55:58.400
 That's what we built Stack Overflow in and still

55:58.400 --> 55:59.360
 is written in.

55:59.360 --> 56:01.920
 And then switch to Ruby, and you're a newbie again.

56:01.920 --> 56:03.240
 But you have the framework.

56:03.240 --> 56:04.440
 I know what a for loop is.

56:04.440 --> 56:05.800
 I know what recursion is.

56:05.800 --> 56:10.040
 I know what a stack trace is.

56:10.040 --> 56:12.040
 I have all the fundamental concepts to be a programmer.

56:12.040 --> 56:13.040
 I just don't know Ruby.

56:13.040 --> 56:14.800
 So I'm still on a higher level.

56:14.800 --> 56:16.600
 I'm not like a beginner beginner, like you're saying.

56:16.600 --> 56:19.140
 I'm just like, I need to apply my programming concepts I already

56:19.140 --> 56:20.360
 know to Ruby.

56:20.360 --> 56:23.280
 Well, so there's a question that's really interesting.

56:23.280 --> 56:26.840
 So looking at Ruby, how do you go about learning enough

56:26.840 --> 56:29.640
 that your intuition can be applied, carried over?

56:29.640 --> 56:30.360
 That's what I was trying to get to.

56:30.360 --> 56:31.600
 It's like what I realized, particularly when I started

56:31.600 --> 56:34.840
 with just me and Robin, I realized if I bother Robin,

56:34.840 --> 56:37.120
 I am now costing us productivity.

56:37.120 --> 56:42.160
 Every time I go to Robin, rather than building our first alpha

56:42.160 --> 56:45.540
 version of discourse, he's now answering my stupid questions

56:45.540 --> 56:46.040
 about Ruby.

56:46.040 --> 56:47.600
 Is that a good use of his time?

56:47.600 --> 56:49.160
 Is that a good use of my time?

56:49.160 --> 56:53.080
 And the answer to both of those was resoundingly no.

56:53.080 --> 56:55.080
 We were getting to an alpha, and it was pretty much just,

56:55.080 --> 56:56.880
 OK, we'll hire more programmers.

56:56.880 --> 57:00.240
 We eventually hired Neil, and then eventually Sam,

57:00.240 --> 57:02.920
 who came in as a cofounder.

57:02.920 --> 57:05.000
 Actually, it was Sam first, then Neil later.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.400
 But the answer to the problem is just

57:06.400 --> 57:08.200
 hire other competent programmers.

57:08.200 --> 57:11.080
 Now I shall pull myself up by my bootstraps

57:11.080 --> 57:12.320
 and learn Ruby.

57:12.320 --> 57:15.960
 But at some point, writing code becomes a liability to you

57:15.960 --> 57:17.360
 in terms of getting things done.

57:17.360 --> 57:18.460
 There's so many other things that

57:18.460 --> 57:20.800
 go on in the project, like building the prototype.

57:20.800 --> 57:23.120
 You mentioned, well, how do you, if you're not writing code,

57:23.120 --> 57:25.680
 how does everybody keep focus on what are we building?

57:25.680 --> 57:28.440
 Well, first, basic mockups and research.

57:28.440 --> 57:30.160
 What do we even want to build?

57:30.160 --> 57:31.240
 There's a little bit of that that goes on.

57:31.240 --> 57:32.800
 But then very quickly, you get to the prototype stage.

57:32.800 --> 57:33.760
 Like, build a prototype.

57:33.760 --> 57:35.920
 Let's iterate on the prototype really, really rapidly.

57:35.920 --> 57:36.840
 And that's what we do with discourse.

57:36.840 --> 57:38.960
 And that's what we demoed to get our seed funding

57:38.960 --> 57:42.320
 for discourse was the alpha version of discourse

57:42.320 --> 57:43.800
 that we had running and ready to go.

57:43.800 --> 57:45.160
 And it was very, it was bad.

57:45.160 --> 57:47.360
 I mean, it was, I'll just tell you it was bad.

57:47.360 --> 57:48.440
 We have screenshots of it.

57:48.440 --> 57:50.280
 I'm just embarrassed to look at it now.

57:50.280 --> 57:51.320
 But it was the prototype.

57:51.320 --> 57:53.740
 We were figuring out what's working, what's not working.

57:53.740 --> 57:58.040
 Because there's such a broad gap between the way

57:58.040 --> 58:00.400
 you think things will work in your mind or even on paper

58:00.400 --> 58:03.040
 and the way they work once you sit and live in the software,

58:03.040 --> 58:05.560
 like actually spend time living and breathing in software,

58:05.560 --> 58:06.720
 so different.

58:06.720 --> 58:10.800
 So my philosophy is get to a prototype.

58:10.800 --> 58:12.380
 And then what you're really optimizing

58:12.380 --> 58:14.800
 for is speed of iteration, like how you can turn the crank.

58:14.800 --> 58:16.120
 How quickly can we iterate?

58:16.120 --> 58:18.000
 That's the absolutely critical metric

58:18.000 --> 58:19.160
 of any software project.

58:19.160 --> 58:20.920
 And I had a tweet recently that people liked.

58:20.920 --> 58:23.160
 And I totally, this is so fundamental to what I do,

58:23.160 --> 58:26.160
 is like if you want to measure the core competency of any

58:26.160 --> 58:28.960
 software tech company, it's the speed at which somebody

58:28.960 --> 58:31.200
 can say, hey, we really need this word in the product.

58:31.200 --> 58:32.280
 Change this word, right?

58:32.280 --> 58:34.280
 Because it will be more clear to the user.

58:34.280 --> 58:36.400
 Like, instead of respond, it's reply or something.

58:36.400 --> 58:39.760
 But there's some, from the conception of that idea

58:39.760 --> 58:42.640
 to how quickly that single word can be changed in your software

58:42.640 --> 58:44.920
 and rolled out to users, that is your life cycle.

58:44.920 --> 58:47.320
 That's your health, your heartbeat.

58:47.320 --> 58:51.640
 If your heartbeat is like super slow, you're basically dead.

58:51.640 --> 58:52.200
 No, seriously.

58:52.200 --> 58:54.880
 Like, if it takes two weeks or even a month

58:54.880 --> 58:56.840
 to get that single word changed, everybody's like, oh my god,

58:56.840 --> 58:57.760
 this is a great idea.

58:57.760 --> 58:59.000
 That word is so much clearer.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.700
 I'm talking about like a super, like everybody's

59:00.700 --> 59:01.660
 on board for this change.

59:01.660 --> 59:03.500
 It's not like, let's just change a word because we're bored.

59:03.500 --> 59:05.600
 It's like, this is an awesome change.

59:05.600 --> 59:07.000
 And then it takes months to roll out.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.120
 It's like, well, you're dead.

59:08.120 --> 59:09.200
 You can't iterate.

59:09.200 --> 59:12.360
 You can't, how are you going to do anything, right?

59:12.360 --> 59:13.800
 So anyway, about the heartbeat, it's

59:13.800 --> 59:15.960
 like, get the prototype and then iterate on it.

59:15.960 --> 59:19.880
 That's what I view as the central tenet of modern software

59:19.880 --> 59:20.480
 development.

59:20.480 --> 59:22.480
 That's fascinating that you put it that way.

59:22.480 --> 59:24.440
 So I work and I build autonomous vehicles.

59:24.440 --> 59:28.160
 And when you look at what, maybe compare Tesla

59:28.160 --> 59:34.120
 to most other automakers, the heart beat for Tesla

59:34.120 --> 59:38.120
 is literally days now in terms of they can over the air

59:38.120 --> 59:41.360
 deploy software updates to all their vehicles, which

59:41.360 --> 59:46.040
 is markedly different than every other automaker, which takes

59:46.040 --> 59:49.160
 years to update a piece of software.

59:49.160 --> 59:52.120
 And that's reflected in everything

59:52.120 --> 59:54.840
 that's the final product.

59:54.840 --> 59:57.280
 That's reflected in really how slowly they

59:57.280 --> 59:58.200
 adapt to the times.

59:58.200 --> 59:59.900
 And to be clear, I'm not saying being a hummingbird

59:59.900 --> 1:00:00.680
 is the goal either.

1:00:00.680 --> 1:00:02.400
 It's like, you don't want a heartbeat that's like so fast.

1:00:02.400 --> 1:00:04.440
 It's like you're just freaking out.

1:00:04.440 --> 1:00:05.720
 But it is a measure of health.

1:00:05.720 --> 1:00:07.320
 You should have a healthy heartbeat.

1:00:07.320 --> 1:00:09.560
 It's up to people listening to decide what that means.

1:00:09.560 --> 1:00:10.880
 But it has to be healthy.

1:00:10.880 --> 1:00:11.680
 It has to be reasonable.

1:00:11.680 --> 1:00:12.840
 Because otherwise, you're just going

1:00:12.840 --> 1:00:15.140
 to be frustrated because that's how you build software.

1:00:15.140 --> 1:00:15.940
 You make mistakes.

1:00:15.940 --> 1:00:16.600
 You roll it out.

1:00:16.600 --> 1:00:17.760
 You live with it.

1:00:17.760 --> 1:00:19.160
 You see what it feels like and say, oh, God,

1:00:19.160 --> 1:00:20.160
 that was a terrible idea.

1:00:20.160 --> 1:00:22.720
 Oh, my gosh, this could be even better if we did Y, right?

1:00:22.720 --> 1:00:23.480
 You turn the crank.

1:00:23.480 --> 1:00:25.920
 And then the more you do that, the faster

1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:28.640
 you get ahead of your competitors ultimately.

1:00:28.640 --> 1:00:29.680
 It's rate of change, right?

1:00:29.680 --> 1:00:30.920
 Delta V, right?

1:00:30.920 --> 1:00:32.660
 How fast are you moving?

1:00:32.660 --> 1:00:34.760
 Well, within a year, you're going to be miles away

1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:36.760
 by the time they catch up with you, right?

1:00:36.760 --> 1:00:37.880
 That's the way it works.

1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:40.800
 And plus, as a software developer and user,

1:00:40.800 --> 1:00:42.800
 I love software that's constantly changing.

1:00:42.800 --> 1:00:45.600
 Because I don't understand people who get super pissed off

1:00:45.600 --> 1:00:47.180
 when like, oh, they changed the software on me.

1:00:47.180 --> 1:00:47.720
 How dare they?

1:00:47.720 --> 1:00:49.520
 I'm like, yes, change the software.

1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:51.280
 Change it all the time, man.

1:00:51.280 --> 1:00:52.720
 That's what makes this stuff great

1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:55.320
 is that it can be changed so rapidly

1:00:55.320 --> 1:00:58.120
 and become something that is greater than it is now.

1:00:58.120 --> 1:01:00.040
 Now, granted, there are some changes that suck.

1:01:00.040 --> 1:01:01.160
 I admit.

1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:02.240
 I've seen it many times.

1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:05.040
 But in general, that's what makes software cool, right?

1:01:05.040 --> 1:01:06.640
 It's that it is so malleable.

1:01:06.640 --> 1:01:08.440
 Fighting that is weird to me.

1:01:08.440 --> 1:01:10.120
 Because it's like, well, you're fighting

1:01:10.120 --> 1:01:12.200
 the essence of the thing that you're building.

1:01:12.200 --> 1:01:13.000
 That doesn't make sense.

1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:14.200
 You want to really embrace that.

1:01:14.200 --> 1:01:16.280
 Not to be a hummingbird, but embrace it

1:01:16.280 --> 1:01:18.200
 to a healthy cycle of your heartbeat, right?

1:01:18.200 --> 1:01:21.040
 So you talk about that people really don't change.

1:01:21.040 --> 1:01:22.520
 It's true.

1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:25.720
 That's why probably a lot of the stuff you write about in your blog

1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:27.200
 probably will remain true.

1:01:27.200 --> 1:01:28.780
 Well, there's a flip side of the coin.

1:01:28.780 --> 1:01:29.580
 People don't change.

1:01:29.580 --> 1:01:31.640
 Like, investing and understanding people

1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:34.840
 is like learning Unix in 1970.

1:01:34.840 --> 1:01:36.960
 Because nothing has changed, right?

1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:38.880
 All those things you've learned about people

1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:40.680
 will still be valid 34 years from now.

1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:43.180
 Whereas if you learn the latest JavaScript framework,

1:01:43.180 --> 1:01:45.360
 that's going to be good for like two years, right?

1:01:45.360 --> 1:01:46.720
 Exactly.

1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:49.800
 But if you look at the future of programming,

1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:52.980
 so there's a people component, but there's also

1:01:52.980 --> 1:01:55.040
 the technology itself.

1:01:55.040 --> 1:01:57.320
 What do you see as the future of programming?

1:01:57.320 --> 1:02:01.840
 Will it change significantly, or as far as you can tell,

1:02:01.840 --> 1:02:04.800
 people are ultimately programming,

1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:08.720
 and so it's not something that you foresee changing

1:02:08.720 --> 1:02:10.040
 in any fundamental way?

1:02:10.040 --> 1:02:12.880
 Well, you've got to go look back on sort

1:02:12.880 --> 1:02:14.440
 of the basics of programming.

1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:15.520
 And one of things that always shocked me

1:02:15.520 --> 1:02:16.400
 is like source control.

1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:18.680
 Like, I didn't learn anything about source control.

1:02:18.680 --> 1:02:22.400
 Granted, I graduated from college in 1992.

1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:25.800
 But I remember hearing from people as late as like 1998,

1:02:25.800 --> 1:02:27.760
 1999, like even maybe today, they're

1:02:27.760 --> 1:02:28.960
 not learning source control.

1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:30.240
 And to me, it's like, well, how can you not

1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:31.600
 learn source control?

1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:34.320
 That is so fundamental to working with other programmers,

1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:36.280
 working in a way that you don't lose your work.

1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:39.720
 Just basic software, the literal bedrock of software

1:02:39.720 --> 1:02:41.280
 development is source control.

1:02:41.280 --> 1:02:42.840
 Now, you compare it today, like GitHub, right?

1:02:42.840 --> 1:02:44.080
 Like Microsoft bought GitHub, which

1:02:44.080 --> 1:02:46.000
 I think was an incredibly smart acquisition move

1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:47.000
 on their part.

1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.880
 Now they have anybody who wants reasonable source control

1:02:49.880 --> 1:02:50.960
 to go sign up on GitHub.

1:02:50.960 --> 1:02:52.440
 It's all set up for you, right?

1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:55.360
 There's tons of walkthroughs, tons of tutorials.

1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:57.320
 So from the concept of like, has programming

1:02:57.320 --> 1:03:00.320
 advanced from, say, 1999, it's like, well, hell, we have GitHub.

1:03:00.320 --> 1:03:01.600
 I mean, my god, yes, right?

1:03:01.600 --> 1:03:04.880
 Like, it's massively advanced over what it was.

1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:08.880
 Now, as to whether programming is significantly different,

1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:09.720
 I'm going to say no.

1:03:09.720 --> 1:03:14.560
 But I think the baseline of what we view as fundamentals

1:03:14.560 --> 1:03:16.560
 will continue to go up and actually get better,

1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:17.520
 like source control.

1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:20.880
 That's one of the fundamentals that has gotten hundreds

1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:23.800
 of orders of magnitude better than it was 10, 20 years ago.

1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:25.000
 So those are the fundamentals.

1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:28.320
 Let me introduce two things that maybe you can comment on.

1:03:28.320 --> 1:03:31.080
 So one is mobile phones.

1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:37.160
 So that could fundamentally transform what programming is,

1:03:37.160 --> 1:03:38.000
 or maybe not.

1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:39.320
 Maybe you can comment on that.

1:03:39.320 --> 1:03:41.560
 And the other one is artificial intelligence,

1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:46.560
 which promises to, in some ways, to do

1:03:46.560 --> 1:03:49.600
 some of the programming for you is one way to think about it.

1:03:49.600 --> 1:03:52.360
 So it's really what a programmer is,

1:03:52.360 --> 1:03:55.720
 is using the intelligence that's inside your skull

1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:57.880
 to do something useful.

1:03:57.880 --> 1:03:59.520
 The hope with artificial intelligence

1:03:59.520 --> 1:04:02.080
 is that it does some of the useful parts for you

1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:03.720
 where you don't have to think about it.

1:04:03.720 --> 1:04:07.720
 So do you see smartphones, the fact that everybody has one,

1:04:07.720 --> 1:04:10.080
 and they're getting more and more powerful as potentially

1:04:10.080 --> 1:04:11.640
 changing programming?

1:04:11.640 --> 1:04:14.360
 And do you see AI as potentially changing programming?

1:04:14.360 --> 1:04:15.640
 OK, so that's good.

1:04:15.640 --> 1:04:17.560
 So smartphones have definitely changed.

1:04:17.560 --> 1:04:20.020
 I mean, since, I guess, 2010 is when they really

1:04:20.020 --> 1:04:21.840
 started getting super popular.

1:04:21.840 --> 1:04:24.760
 I mean, in the last eight years, the world

1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:25.920
 has literally changed, right?

1:04:25.920 --> 1:04:28.520
 Everybody carries a computer around, and that's normal.

1:04:28.520 --> 1:04:30.920
 I mean, that is such a huge change in society.

1:04:30.920 --> 1:04:32.460
 I think we're still dealing with a lot

1:04:32.460 --> 1:04:35.260
 of the positive and negative ramifications of that, right?

1:04:35.260 --> 1:04:36.280
 Everybody's connected all the time.

1:04:36.280 --> 1:04:37.980
 Everybody's on the computer all the time.

1:04:37.980 --> 1:04:40.360
 That was my dream world as a geek, right?

1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:42.560
 But it's like, be careful what you ask for, right?

1:04:42.560 --> 1:04:44.200
 Like, wow, now everybody has a computer.

1:04:44.200 --> 1:04:47.040
 It's not quite the utopia that we thought it would be, right?

1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:49.720
 Computers can be used for a lot of stuff that's not necessarily

1:04:49.720 --> 1:04:51.200
 great.

1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:53.160
 So to me, that's the central focus of the smartphone,

1:04:53.160 --> 1:04:55.720
 is just that it puts a computer in front of everyone.

1:04:55.720 --> 1:04:57.800
 Granted, a small, touch screen, smallish,

1:04:57.800 --> 1:04:59.080
 touch screen computer.

1:04:59.080 --> 1:05:00.560
 But as for programming, I don't know.

1:05:00.560 --> 1:05:03.080
 I don't think that I've kind of, over time,

1:05:03.080 --> 1:05:05.360
 come to subscribe to the Unix view of the world

1:05:05.360 --> 1:05:06.600
 when it comes to programming.

1:05:06.600 --> 1:05:09.960
 You want to teach these basic command line things,

1:05:09.960 --> 1:05:11.280
 and that is just what programming

1:05:11.280 --> 1:05:14.440
 is going to be for, I think, a long, long time.

1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:17.120
 I don't think there's any magical visual programming

1:05:17.120 --> 1:05:20.160
 that's going to happen.

1:05:20.160 --> 1:05:20.680
 I don't know.

1:05:20.680 --> 1:05:23.180
 I've, over time, have become a believer in that Unix

1:05:23.180 --> 1:05:25.120
 philosophy of just, you know, they kind of had

1:05:25.120 --> 1:05:26.440
 to write with Unix.

1:05:26.440 --> 1:05:28.960
 That's going to be the way it is for a long, long time.

1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:31.640
 And we'll continue to, like I said, raise the baseline.

1:05:31.640 --> 1:05:32.440
 The tools will get better.

1:05:32.440 --> 1:05:33.020
 It'll get simpler.

1:05:33.020 --> 1:05:34.440
 But it's still fundamentally going

1:05:34.440 --> 1:05:37.200
 to be command line tools, fancy IDEs.

1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:39.240
 That's kind of it for the foreseeable future.

1:05:39.240 --> 1:05:41.440
 I'm not seeing any visual programming stuff

1:05:41.440 --> 1:05:42.240
 on the horizon.

1:05:42.240 --> 1:05:43.200
 Because you kind of think, like, what

1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:45.200
 do you do on a smartphone that will be directly

1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:46.480
 analogous to programming?

1:05:46.480 --> 1:05:48.240
 Like, I'm trying to think, right?

1:05:48.240 --> 1:05:52.200
 And there's really not much.

1:05:52.200 --> 1:05:55.160
 So not necessarily analogous to programming,

1:05:55.160 --> 1:06:01.680
 but the kind of things that, the kind of programs

1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:07.360
 you would need to write might need to be very different.

1:06:07.360 --> 1:06:08.040
 Yeah.

1:06:08.040 --> 1:06:09.480
 And the kind of languages.

1:06:09.480 --> 1:06:12.400
 I mean, but I probably also subscribe to the same,

1:06:12.400 --> 1:06:14.260
 just because everything in this world

1:06:14.260 --> 1:06:16.200
 might be written in JavaScript.

1:06:16.200 --> 1:06:16.720
 Oh, yeah.

1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:17.760
 That's already happening.

1:06:17.760 --> 1:06:18.960
 I mean, discourse is a bet.

1:06:18.960 --> 1:06:20.840
 Discourse itself, JavaScript, is another bet

1:06:20.840 --> 1:06:21.920
 on that side of the table.

1:06:21.920 --> 1:06:23.680
 And I still try and believe in that.

1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:26.220
 So I would say smartphones have mostly a cultural shift more

1:06:26.220 --> 1:06:27.720
 than a programming shift.

1:06:27.720 --> 1:06:30.080
 Now, your other question was about artificial intelligence

1:06:30.080 --> 1:06:32.760
 and sort of devices predicting what you're going to do.

1:06:32.760 --> 1:06:34.640
 And I do think there's some strength to that.

1:06:34.640 --> 1:06:37.040
 I think artificial intelligence is kind of overselling it

1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:37.680
 in terms of what it's doing.

1:06:37.680 --> 1:06:39.720
 It's more like, people are predictable, right?

1:06:39.720 --> 1:06:41.120
 People do the same things.

1:06:41.120 --> 1:06:43.120
 Let me give you an example.

1:06:43.120 --> 1:06:44.720
 One check we put in a discourse that's

1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:48.280
 been a lot of big commercial websites is,

1:06:48.280 --> 1:06:51.160
 say you log in from New York City now.

1:06:51.160 --> 1:06:54.200
 And then an hour later, you log in from San Francisco.

1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:56.600
 It's like, well, hmm, that's interesting.

1:06:56.600 --> 1:06:59.560
 How did you get from New York to San Francisco in one hour?

1:06:59.560 --> 1:07:01.220
 So at that point, you're like, OK, this

1:07:01.220 --> 1:07:02.680
 is a suspicious login at that point.

1:07:02.680 --> 1:07:03.520
 So we would alert you.

1:07:03.520 --> 1:07:04.200
 It's like, OK.

1:07:04.200 --> 1:07:05.360
 But that's not AI, right?

1:07:05.360 --> 1:07:09.080
 That's just a heuristic of like, how did you, in one hour,

1:07:09.080 --> 1:07:10.880
 get 2,000 miles, right?

1:07:10.880 --> 1:07:11.440
 That doesn't.

1:07:11.440 --> 1:07:12.040
 I mean, you're grand.

1:07:12.040 --> 1:07:12.680
 Maybe you're on a VPN.

1:07:12.680 --> 1:07:14.040
 There's other ways to happen.

1:07:14.040 --> 1:07:16.040
 That's just a basic prediction based on the idea

1:07:16.040 --> 1:07:19.440
 that people pretty much don't move around that much.

1:07:19.440 --> 1:07:20.920
 They may travel occasionally.

1:07:20.920 --> 1:07:23.160
 But nobody, unless you're a traveling salesman that's

1:07:23.160 --> 1:07:26.280
 literally traveling the world every day,

1:07:26.280 --> 1:07:28.280
 there's so much repetition and predictability

1:07:28.280 --> 1:07:29.740
 in terms of things you're going to do.

1:07:29.740 --> 1:07:32.240
 And I think good software anticipates your needs.

1:07:32.240 --> 1:07:33.560
 For example, Google, I think it's

1:07:33.560 --> 1:07:35.320
 called Google Now or whatever that Google thing is

1:07:35.320 --> 1:07:36.800
 that predicts your commute and predicts,

1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:39.200
 based on your phone location, where are you every day?

1:07:39.200 --> 1:07:41.840
 Well, that's probably where you work, that kind of stuff.

1:07:41.840 --> 1:07:43.920
 I do think computers can get a lot better at that.

1:07:43.920 --> 1:07:46.320
 I hesitate to call it full blown AI.

1:07:46.320 --> 1:07:48.880
 It's just computers getting better at like, first of all,

1:07:48.880 --> 1:07:50.560
 they have a ton of data because everybody has a smartphone.

1:07:50.560 --> 1:07:52.080
 Now, all of a sudden, we have all this data

1:07:52.080 --> 1:07:53.880
 that we didn't have before about location,

1:07:53.880 --> 1:07:59.240
 about communication, and feeding that into some basic heuristics

1:07:59.240 --> 1:08:01.080
 and maybe some fancy algorithms that turn it

1:08:01.080 --> 1:08:03.160
 into predictions of anticipating your needs,

1:08:03.160 --> 1:08:04.520
 like a friend would, right?

1:08:04.520 --> 1:08:06.160
 Like, oh, hey, I see your home.

1:08:06.160 --> 1:08:07.540
 Would you like some dinner, right?

1:08:07.540 --> 1:08:09.320
 Like, let's go get some food, because that's usually

1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:10.840
 what we do at this time of day, right?

1:08:10.840 --> 1:08:13.680
 In the context of actually the act of programming,

1:08:13.680 --> 1:08:15.680
 do you see IDEs improving and making

1:08:15.680 --> 1:08:17.400
 the life of programming as better?

1:08:17.400 --> 1:08:19.160
 I do think that is possible, because there's

1:08:19.160 --> 1:08:20.760
 a lot of repetition in programming, right?

1:08:20.760 --> 1:08:23.680
 Oh, you know, Clippy would be the bad example of, oh, I see.

1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:25.960
 It looks like you're writing a for loop.

1:08:25.960 --> 1:08:28.400
 But there are patterns in code, right?

1:08:28.400 --> 1:08:30.880
 And actually, libraries are kind of like that, right?

1:08:30.880 --> 1:08:35.440
 Rather than go code up your own HTTP request library,

1:08:35.440 --> 1:08:37.560
 it's like, well, you'd use one of the existing ones

1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:38.400
 that we have.

1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:39.800
 That's already a troubleshot, right?

1:08:39.800 --> 1:08:41.440
 It's not AI, per se.

1:08:41.440 --> 1:08:46.180
 It's just building better LEGO bricks, bigger LEGO bricks,

1:08:46.180 --> 1:08:47.760
 that have more functionality in them,

1:08:47.760 --> 1:08:49.460
 so people don't have to worry about the low level

1:08:49.460 --> 1:08:50.560
 stuff as much anymore.

1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:52.040
 Like, WordPress, for example, to me,

1:08:52.040 --> 1:08:54.160
 is like a tool for somebody who isn't a programmer

1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:55.800
 to do something.

1:08:55.800 --> 1:08:57.680
 I mean, you can turn WordPress into anything.

1:08:57.680 --> 1:08:59.800
 It's kind of crazy, actually, through plugins, right?

1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:01.400
 And that's not programming, per se.

1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:04.560
 It's just LEGO bricks stacking WordPress elements, right?

1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:06.620
 And a little bit of configuration glue.

1:09:06.620 --> 1:09:09.040
 So I would say, maybe in a broader sense, what I'm seeing,

1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:14.040
 like, there'll be more gluing and less actual programming.

1:09:14.200 --> 1:09:15.600
 And that's a good thing, right?

1:09:15.600 --> 1:09:16.720
 Because most of the stuff you need

1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:17.960
 is kind of out there already.

1:09:17.960 --> 1:09:20.120
 You said 1970s, Unix.

1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:25.120
 Do you see PHP and these kind of old remnants

1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:31.760
 of the early birth of programming

1:09:31.760 --> 1:09:33.760
 remaining with us for a long time?

1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:35.640
 Like you said, Unix in itself.

1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:40.640
 Do you see, ultimately, this stuff just being there

1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:42.940
 out of momentum?

1:09:42.940 --> 1:09:44.160
 I kind of do.

1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:46.200
 I mean, I was a big believer in Windows early on.

1:09:46.200 --> 1:09:47.400
 And I was a big, you know, I was like,

1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:48.780
 Unix, what a waste of time.

1:09:48.780 --> 1:09:50.120
 But over time, I've completely flipped on that,

1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:51.720
 where I was like, okay, the Unix guys were right.

1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:54.640
 And pretty much Microsoft and Windows were kind of wrong,

1:09:54.640 --> 1:09:55.760
 at least on the server side.

1:09:55.760 --> 1:09:57.400
 Now, on the desktop, right, you need a GUI,

1:09:57.400 --> 1:09:58.240
 you need all that stuff.

1:09:58.240 --> 1:09:59.200
 And you have the two philosophies,

1:09:59.200 --> 1:10:02.680
 like Apple built on Unix, effectively, Darwin.

1:10:02.680 --> 1:10:04.600
 And on the desktop, it's a slightly different story.

1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:07.000
 But on the server side, where you're gonna be programming.

1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:08.480
 Now, it's a question of where the programming's gonna be.

1:10:08.480 --> 1:10:10.760
 There's gonna be a lot more like client side programming,

1:10:10.760 --> 1:10:13.620
 because technically, discourse is client side programming.

1:10:13.620 --> 1:10:14.520
 The way you get discourse,

1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:16.200
 we deliver a big ball of JavaScript,

1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:18.260
 which is then executed locally.

1:10:18.260 --> 1:10:20.980
 So we're really using a lot more local computing power.

1:10:20.980 --> 1:10:22.360
 We'll still retrieve the data, obviously,

1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:24.320
 we have to display the posts on the screen and so forth.

1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:27.040
 But in terms of like sorting and a lot of the basic stuff,

1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:29.480
 we're using the host processor.

1:10:29.480 --> 1:10:31.280
 But to the extent that a lot of programming

1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:33.680
 is still gonna be server side, I would say, yeah,

1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:35.320
 the Unix philosophy definitely won.

1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:38.640
 And there'll be different veneers over Unix,

1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:40.800
 but it's still, if you peel away one or two layers,

1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:44.340
 it's gonna be Unixy for a long, I think Unix won.

1:10:44.340 --> 1:10:45.520
 I mean, so definitively.

1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:47.440
 It's interesting to hear you say that,

1:10:47.440 --> 1:10:49.080
 because you've done so much excellent work

1:10:49.080 --> 1:10:52.840
 on the Microsoft side in terms of backend development.

1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:53.680
 Cool.

1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:56.960
 So what's the future hold for Jeff Atwood?

1:10:56.960 --> 1:11:01.820
 I mean, the discourse, continuing the discourse

1:11:01.820 --> 1:11:03.960
 in trying to improve conversation on the web?

1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:05.640
 Well, discourse is what I've viewed as a,

1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:07.040
 and originally I called it a five year project,

1:11:07.040 --> 1:11:08.800
 then really quickly revised that to a 10 year project.

1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:12.280
 So we started in early 2013,

1:11:12.280 --> 1:11:13.640
 that's when we launched the first version.

1:11:13.640 --> 1:11:16.120
 So we're still five years in.

1:11:16.120 --> 1:11:17.400
 This is the part where it starts getting good.

1:11:17.400 --> 1:11:18.540
 Like we have a good product now.

1:11:18.540 --> 1:11:21.760
 Discourse, there's any project you build in software,

1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:23.280
 it takes three years to build what you want it

1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:24.100
 to build anyway.

1:11:24.100 --> 1:11:26.560
 Like V1 is gonna be terrible, which it was.

1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:27.400
 But you ship it anyway,

1:11:27.400 --> 1:11:29.000
 because that's how you get better at stuff.

1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:29.920
 It's about turning the crank.

1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:31.400
 It's not about V1 being perfect,

1:11:31.400 --> 1:11:32.800
 because that's ridiculous.

1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:35.560
 It's about V1, then let's get really good at V1.1,

1:11:35.560 --> 1:11:38.000
 1.2, 1.3, like how fast can we iterate?

1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:40.120
 And I think we're iterating like crazy on discourse,

1:11:40.120 --> 1:11:41.920
 to the point that like, it's a really good product now.

1:11:41.920 --> 1:11:43.600
 We have serious momentum.

1:11:44.640 --> 1:11:46.240
 And my original vision was,

1:11:46.240 --> 1:11:48.120
 I wanna be the WordPress of discussion.

1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:49.860
 Meaning someone came to you and said,

1:11:49.860 --> 1:11:50.760
 I wanna start a blog.

1:11:50.760 --> 1:11:53.000
 Although the very question is kind of archaic now.

1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.320
 It's like, who actually blogs anymore?

1:11:55.320 --> 1:11:59.000
 But I wanted the answer to that to be,

1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.360
 it would be WordPress normally,

1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:02.240
 because that's the obvious choice

1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:04.200
 for blogging most of the time.

1:12:04.200 --> 1:12:06.960
 But if someone said, hey, I need a group of people

1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:08.760
 to get together and do something,

1:12:08.760 --> 1:12:10.400
 the answer should be discourse, right?

1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:11.800
 That should be the default answer for people.

1:12:11.800 --> 1:12:13.360
 Because it's open source, it's free,

1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:14.200
 doesn't cost you anything.

1:12:14.200 --> 1:12:15.960
 You control it, you can run it.

1:12:15.960 --> 1:12:17.400
 Your minimum server cost for discourse

1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:19.560
 is five bucks a month at this point.

1:12:19.560 --> 1:12:21.560
 They actually got the VPS prices down.

1:12:21.560 --> 1:12:23.860
 It used to be $10 a month for one gigabyte of RAM,

1:12:23.860 --> 1:12:28.400
 which we have a kind of heavy stack.

1:12:28.400 --> 1:12:30.280
 Like there's a lot of stuff in discourse.

1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:32.520
 You need Postgres, you need Redis, you need Ruby,

1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:35.760
 and Rails, you need a sidekick for scheduling.

1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:36.960
 It's not a trivial amount of stuff

1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:38.040
 because we were architected for like,

1:12:38.040 --> 1:12:39.460
 look, we're building for the next 10 years.

1:12:39.460 --> 1:12:41.960
 I don't care about shared PHP hosting.

1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:44.160
 That's not my model.

1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:45.880
 My idea is like, hey, eventually,

1:12:45.880 --> 1:12:47.480
 this is gonna be very cheap for everybody

1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:49.120
 and I wanna build it right.

1:12:49.120 --> 1:12:53.460
 Using again, higher, bigger building block levels, right?

1:12:53.460 --> 1:12:54.440
 That have more requirements.

1:12:54.440 --> 1:12:56.600
 And there's a WordPress model of WordPress.org,

1:12:56.600 --> 1:12:57.680
 WordPress.com.

1:12:57.680 --> 1:13:00.960
 Is there a central hosting for discourse or no?

1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:01.800
 There is.

1:13:01.800 --> 1:13:03.600
 We're not strictly segmenting into the open source

1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:05.080
 versus the commercial side.

1:13:05.080 --> 1:13:06.000
 We have a hosting business.

1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:07.080
 That's how discourse makes money

1:13:07.080 --> 1:13:08.840
 is we host discourse instances

1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:10.640
 and we have really close relationship with our customers

1:13:10.640 --> 1:13:14.640
 of the symbiosis of them giving us feedback on the product.

1:13:14.640 --> 1:13:16.440
 We definitely wait feedback from customers

1:13:16.440 --> 1:13:18.360
 a lot heavier than feedback from somebody

1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:20.880
 who just wanders by and gives feedback.

1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:22.440
 But that's where we make all our money.

1:13:22.440 --> 1:13:24.600
 But we don't have a strict division.

1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:26.600
 We encourage people to use discourse.

1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:29.040
 Like the whole point is that it's free, right?

1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:29.960
 Anybody can set it up.

1:13:29.960 --> 1:13:32.600
 I don't wanna be the only person that hosts discourse.

1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:34.200
 That's absolutely not the goal.

1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:36.280
 But it is a primary way for us to build a business

1:13:36.280 --> 1:13:37.600
 and it's actually kind of a great business.

1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:40.280
 I mean, the business is going really, really well

1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:41.340
 in terms of hosting.

1:13:41.340 --> 1:13:44.280
 So I used to work at Google Research.

1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:47.040
 It's a company that's basically funded on advertisements.

1:13:47.040 --> 1:13:48.120
 So it's Facebook.

1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:50.360
 Let me ask if you can comment on it.

1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:53.500
 I think advertisement is best.

1:13:53.500 --> 1:13:56.580
 So you'd be extremely critical on what ads are

1:13:56.580 --> 1:13:59.700
 but at its best, it's actually serving you.

1:13:59.700 --> 1:14:02.000
 In a sense, it's giving you, it's connecting you

1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:05.640
 to what you would want to explore.

1:14:05.640 --> 1:14:08.040
 So it's like related posts or related content.

1:14:08.040 --> 1:14:10.200
 It's the same, that's the best of advertisement.

1:14:10.200 --> 1:14:15.200
 So discourse is connecting people based on their interests.

1:14:16.040 --> 1:14:20.080
 It seems like a place where advertisement at its best

1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:21.740
 could actually serve the users.

1:14:21.740 --> 1:14:24.880
 Is that something that you're considering thinking about

1:14:24.880 --> 1:14:29.440
 as a way to bring, to financially support the platform?

1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:31.360
 That's interesting because I actually have

1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:32.560
 a contrarian view of advertising,

1:14:32.560 --> 1:14:33.760
 which I kind of agree with you.

1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:36.800
 I recently installed AdBlocker reluctantly

1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:38.280
 because I don't like to do that.

1:14:38.280 --> 1:14:40.580
 But the performance of the ads, man,

1:14:40.580 --> 1:14:43.280
 they're so heavy now and it's just crazy.

1:14:43.280 --> 1:14:45.040
 So it's almost like a performance argument

1:14:45.040 --> 1:14:47.200
 more than like, I actually am pro ads

1:14:47.200 --> 1:14:49.480
 and I have a contrarian viewpoint.

1:14:49.480 --> 1:14:50.320
 I agree with you.

1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:51.960
 If you do ads right, it's serving you stuff

1:14:51.960 --> 1:14:53.300
 you would be interested in anyway.

1:14:53.300 --> 1:14:56.520
 I don't mind that, that actually is kind of a good thing.

1:14:56.520 --> 1:15:00.000
 So plus I think it's rational to wanna support

1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:01.680
 the people that are doing this work

1:15:01.680 --> 1:15:02.600
 through seeing their ads.

1:15:02.600 --> 1:15:04.040
 But that said, I run AdBlock now,

1:15:04.040 --> 1:15:07.520
 which I didn't wanna do, but I was convinced

1:15:07.520 --> 1:15:10.080
 by all these articles, like 30, 40 megabytes of stuff

1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:11.600
 just to serve you ads.

1:15:12.480 --> 1:15:15.980
 Yeah, it feels like ads now are like the experts exchange

1:15:15.980 --> 1:15:18.240
 of whenever you start a stock overflow.

1:15:18.240 --> 1:15:19.440
 It's a little bit, it's overwhelming.

1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:21.040
 Oh, there's so many companies in ad tech

1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:21.880
 that it's embarrassing.

1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:23.180
 Like you can do that, have you seen those logo charts

1:15:23.180 --> 1:15:24.280
 of like just the whole page?

1:15:24.280 --> 1:15:26.200
 It's like you can't even see them, they're so small.

1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:27.800
 There's so many companies in the space.

1:15:27.800 --> 1:15:29.640
 But since you brought it up, I do wanna point out

1:15:29.640 --> 1:15:31.840
 that very, very few discourse sites actually run

1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:33.080
 using an ad supported model.

1:15:33.080 --> 1:15:34.680
 It's not effective.

1:15:34.680 --> 1:15:37.600
 Like it's too diluted, it's too weird,

1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:40.560
 it doesn't pay well, and like users hate it.

1:15:40.560 --> 1:15:42.800
 So it's a combination of like users hate it,

1:15:42.800 --> 1:15:44.440
 it doesn't actually work that well in practice.

1:15:44.440 --> 1:15:45.760
 Like in theory, yes, I agree with you.

1:15:45.760 --> 1:15:48.400
 If you had clean, fast ads that were exactly

1:15:48.400 --> 1:15:50.320
 the stuff you would be interested in, awesome.

1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:52.440
 We're so far from that though, right?

1:15:52.440 --> 1:15:53.800
 Like, and Google does an okay job.

1:15:53.800 --> 1:15:55.380
 They do retargeting and stuff like that,

1:15:55.380 --> 1:15:59.280
 but in the real world, discourse sites

1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:01.020
 rarely can make ads work.

1:16:01.020 --> 1:16:03.020
 It just doesn't work for so many reasons.

1:16:03.020 --> 1:16:05.600
 But you know what does work is subscriptions,

1:16:05.600 --> 1:16:10.600
 Patreon, affiliate codes for like Amazon,

1:16:10.660 --> 1:16:13.080
 of like just, oh, here's a cool yo yo, click,

1:16:13.080 --> 1:16:14.360
 and then you click and go to Amazon,

1:16:14.360 --> 1:16:15.680
 they get a small percentage of that,

1:16:15.680 --> 1:16:17.120
 which is fair, I think.

1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:19.120
 I mean, because you saw the yo yo on that site

1:16:19.120 --> 1:16:21.080
 and you clicked through and you bought it, right?

1:16:21.080 --> 1:16:22.560
 That's fair for them to get 5% of that

1:16:22.560 --> 1:16:24.200
 or 2% of that, whatever it is.

1:16:24.200 --> 1:16:25.960
 Those things definitely work.

1:16:25.960 --> 1:16:28.580
 In fact, a site that I used to participate on a lot,

1:16:28.580 --> 1:16:29.880
 I helped the owner.

1:16:29.880 --> 1:16:32.440
 One of the things, I got them to switch to discourse.

1:16:32.440 --> 1:16:34.200
 I basically paid them to switch to discourse

1:16:34.200 --> 1:16:35.320
 because I was like, look, you guys got to switch.

1:16:35.320 --> 1:16:38.520
 I can't come here anymore on this terrible software.

1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:40.120
 But I was like, look, and on top of that,

1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:42.280
 like you're serving people ads that they hate.

1:16:42.280 --> 1:16:43.920
 Like you should just go full on Patreon

1:16:43.920 --> 1:16:45.320
 because he had a little bit of Patreon.

1:16:45.320 --> 1:16:49.720
 Go full on Patreon, do the Amazon affiliates thing

1:16:49.720 --> 1:16:51.960
 for any Amazon links that get posted and just do that

1:16:51.960 --> 1:16:53.600
 and just triple down on that stuff.

1:16:53.600 --> 1:16:55.320
 And that's worked really well for them

1:16:55.320 --> 1:16:56.780
 and this creator in particular.

1:16:56.780 --> 1:16:59.480
 So that stuff works, but traditional ads,

1:16:59.480 --> 1:17:01.720
 I mean, definitely not working, at least on discourse.

1:17:01.720 --> 1:17:03.400
 So last question.

1:17:03.400 --> 1:17:05.920
 You've created the code keyboard.

1:17:05.920 --> 1:17:09.860
 I've programmed most of my adult life on a Kinesis keyboard.

1:17:09.860 --> 1:17:12.080
 I have one upstairs now.

1:17:12.080 --> 1:17:14.520
 Can you describe what a mechanical keyboard is

1:17:14.520 --> 1:17:16.720
 and why is it something that makes you happy?

1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:18.800
 Well, you know, this is another fetish item, really.

1:17:18.800 --> 1:17:20.160
 Like, it's not required.

1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:22.240
 You can do programming on any kind of keyboard,

1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:23.880
 even like an onscreen keyboard.

1:17:23.880 --> 1:17:25.960
 Oh, god, that's terrifying.

1:17:25.960 --> 1:17:27.000
 But you could.

1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:28.760
 I mean, if you look back at the early days of computing,

1:17:28.760 --> 1:17:31.400
 there were chiclet keyboards, which are awful.

1:17:31.400 --> 1:17:32.520
 But what's a chiclet keyboard?

1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:33.120
 Oh, god.

1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:36.200
 OK, well, it's just like thin rubber membranes.

1:17:36.200 --> 1:17:37.680
 Oh, the rubber ones, oh, no.

1:17:37.680 --> 1:17:38.840
 Super bad, right?

1:17:38.840 --> 1:17:40.360
 So it's a fetish item.

1:17:40.360 --> 1:17:43.280
 All that really says is, look, I care really about keyboards

1:17:43.280 --> 1:17:45.080
 because the keyboard is the primary method of communication

1:17:45.080 --> 1:17:46.240
 with the computer.

1:17:46.240 --> 1:17:49.320
 So it's just like having a nice mic for this podcast.

1:17:49.320 --> 1:17:50.600
 You want a nice keyboard, right?

1:17:50.600 --> 1:17:52.200
 Because it has a very tactile feel.

1:17:52.200 --> 1:17:54.040
 I can tell exactly when I press the key.

1:17:54.040 --> 1:17:55.080
 I get that little click.

1:17:55.080 --> 1:17:56.480
 So, oh, and it feels good.

1:17:56.480 --> 1:17:57.980
 And it's also kind of a fetish item.

1:17:57.980 --> 1:18:00.320
 It's like, wow, I care enough about programming

1:18:00.320 --> 1:18:02.440
 that I care about the tool, the primary tool,

1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:03.320
 that I use to communicate with the computer,

1:18:03.320 --> 1:18:06.440
 make sure it's as good as it feels good to use for me.

1:18:06.440 --> 1:18:08.360
 And I can be very productive with it.

1:18:08.360 --> 1:18:10.720
 So to be honest, it's a little bit of a fetish item,

1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:11.320
 but a good one.

1:18:11.320 --> 1:18:12.560
 It indicates that you're serious.

1:18:12.560 --> 1:18:13.640
 It indicates you're interested.

1:18:13.640 --> 1:18:15.280
 It indicates that you care about the fundamentals.

1:18:15.280 --> 1:18:17.520
 Because you know what makes you a good programmer?

1:18:17.520 --> 1:18:19.360
 Being able to type really fast, right?

1:18:19.360 --> 1:18:20.600
 This is true, right?

1:18:20.600 --> 1:18:23.480
 So a core skill is just being able to type fast enough

1:18:23.480 --> 1:18:26.120
 to get your ideas out of your head into the code base.

1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:28.400
 So just practicing your typing can make you

1:18:28.400 --> 1:18:29.760
 a better programmer.

1:18:29.760 --> 1:18:33.720
 It is also something that makes you,

1:18:33.720 --> 1:18:36.640
 well, makes you enjoy typing, correct?

1:18:36.640 --> 1:18:39.940
 The actual act, something about the process.

1:18:39.940 --> 1:18:41.220
 Like I play piano.

1:18:41.220 --> 1:18:42.060
 It's tactile.

1:18:42.060 --> 1:18:46.200
 There's a tactile feel that ultimately feeds the passion,

1:18:46.200 --> 1:18:47.000
 makes you happy.

1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:47.400
 Right.

1:18:47.400 --> 1:18:47.840
 No, totally.

1:18:47.840 --> 1:18:48.160
 That's it.

1:18:48.160 --> 1:18:50.000
 I mean, and it's funny because artisanal keyboards have

1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:50.640
 exploded.

1:18:50.640 --> 1:18:53.400
 Like Massdrop has gone ballistic with this stuff.

1:18:53.400 --> 1:18:55.560
 There's probably like 500 keyboard projects

1:18:55.560 --> 1:18:56.520
 on Massdrop alone.

1:18:56.520 --> 1:18:58.120
 And there's some other guy I follow on Twitter.

1:18:58.120 --> 1:19:00.400
 I used to write for the site The Tech Report way

1:19:00.400 --> 1:19:01.360
 back in the day.

1:19:01.360 --> 1:19:02.440
 And he's like, every week he's just

1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:05.000
 posting what I call keyboard porn of just cool keyboards.

1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:07.160
 Like, oh my god, those look really cool, right?

1:19:07.160 --> 1:19:09.760
 It's like, how many keyboards does this guy have, right?

1:19:09.760 --> 1:19:10.680
 It's kind of like me with yo yos.

1:19:10.680 --> 1:19:11.480
 How many yo yos do you have?

1:19:11.480 --> 1:19:12.320
 How many do you need?

1:19:12.320 --> 1:19:14.880
 Well, technically one, but I like a lot.

1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:15.800
 I don't know why.

1:19:15.800 --> 1:19:17.200
 So same thing with keyboards.

1:19:17.200 --> 1:19:18.880
 So yeah, they're awesome.

1:19:18.880 --> 1:19:20.720
 Like, I highly recommend anybody that

1:19:20.720 --> 1:19:23.040
 doesn't have a mechanical to research it, look into it,

1:19:23.040 --> 1:19:24.360
 and see what you like.

1:19:24.360 --> 1:19:26.260
 And it's ultimately a fetish item.

1:19:26.260 --> 1:19:30.120
 But I think these sort of items, these religious artifacts

1:19:30.120 --> 1:19:32.160
 that we have, are part of what make us human.

1:19:32.160 --> 1:19:33.800
 Like, that part's important, right?

1:19:33.800 --> 1:19:35.720
 It's kind of what makes life worth living.

1:19:35.720 --> 1:19:37.000
 Yeah.

1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:38.840
 It's not necessary in the strictest sense,

1:19:38.840 --> 1:19:42.280
 but ain't nothing necessary if you think about it, right?

1:19:42.280 --> 1:19:44.240
 Like, so yeah, why not?

1:19:44.240 --> 1:19:45.320
 So sure.

1:19:45.320 --> 1:19:47.440
 Jeff, thank you so much for talking today.

1:19:47.440 --> 1:19:48.280
 Yeah, you're welcome.

1:19:48.280 --> 1:20:09.400
 Thanks for having me.
