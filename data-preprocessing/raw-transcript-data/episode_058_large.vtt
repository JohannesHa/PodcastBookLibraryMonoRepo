00:00.000 --> 00:02.680
 The following is a conversation with Michael Stevens,

00:02.680 --> 00:04.500
 the creator of Vsauce,

00:04.500 --> 00:07.000
 one of the most popular educational YouTube channels

00:07.000 --> 00:10.080
 in the world with over 15 million subscribers

00:10.080 --> 00:13.040
 and over 1.7 billion views.

00:13.040 --> 00:16.160
 His videos often ask and answer questions

00:16.160 --> 00:18.780
 that are both profound and entertaining,

00:18.780 --> 00:21.800
 spanning topics from physics to psychology.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.640
 Popular questions include,

00:23.640 --> 00:25.440
 what if everyone jumped at once?

00:25.440 --> 00:27.680
 Or what if the sun disappeared?

00:27.680 --> 00:29.820
 Or why are things creepy?

00:29.820 --> 00:32.840
 Or what if the earth stopped spinning?

00:32.840 --> 00:34.040
 As part of his channel,

00:34.040 --> 00:36.320
 he created three seasons of Mind Field,

00:36.320 --> 00:38.760
 a series that explored human behavior.

00:38.760 --> 00:41.640
 His curiosity and passion are contagious

00:41.640 --> 00:44.080
 and inspiring to millions of people.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.240
 And so as an educator,

00:45.240 --> 00:47.540
 his impact and contribution to the world

00:47.540 --> 00:49.780
 is truly immeasurable.

00:49.780 --> 00:52.840
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

00:52.840 --> 00:55.200
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

00:55.200 --> 00:57.160
 give it five stars on Apple Podcast,

00:57.160 --> 00:58.600
 support it on Patreon,

00:58.600 --> 01:00.640
 or simply connect with me on Twitter,

01:00.640 --> 01:03.800
 at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

01:04.900 --> 01:06.400
 I recently started doing ads

01:06.400 --> 01:08.120
 at the end of the introduction.

01:08.120 --> 01:10.780
 I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode

01:10.780 --> 01:12.740
 and never any ads in the middle

01:12.740 --> 01:14.760
 that break the flow of the conversation.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.120
 I hope that works for you

01:16.120 --> 01:19.000
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.500
 This show is presented by Cash App,

01:21.500 --> 01:24.000
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.560
 I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,

01:26.560 --> 01:28.280
 but you can also use it to buy, sell,

01:28.280 --> 01:30.720
 and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.

01:30.720 --> 01:33.480
 Cash App also has a new investing feature.

01:33.480 --> 01:36.320
 You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,

01:36.320 --> 01:38.280
 no matter what the stock price is.

01:38.280 --> 01:40.880
 Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,

01:40.880 --> 01:44.200
 a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.180
 I'm excited to be working with Cash App

01:46.180 --> 01:49.120
 to support one of my favorite organizations called First,

01:49.120 --> 01:52.440
 best known for their first robotics and Lego competitions.

01:52.440 --> 01:56.000
 They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students

01:56.000 --> 01:57.720
 in over 110 countries

01:57.720 --> 02:00.320
 and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,

02:00.320 --> 02:01.640
 which means the donated money

02:01.640 --> 02:04.280
 is used to maximum effectiveness.

02:04.280 --> 02:07.180
 When you get Cash App from the App Store, Google Play,

02:07.180 --> 02:11.040
 and use code LEXPODCAST, you'll get $10,

02:11.040 --> 02:13.760
 and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,

02:13.760 --> 02:15.480
 which again is an organization

02:15.480 --> 02:18.360
 that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys

02:18.360 --> 02:21.660
 to dream of engineering a better world.

02:21.660 --> 02:25.940
 And now here's my conversation with Michael Stevens.

02:25.940 --> 02:30.260
 One of your deeper interests is psychology,

02:30.260 --> 02:31.760
 understanding human behavior.

02:32.620 --> 02:35.480
 You've pointed out how messy studying human behavior is

02:35.480 --> 02:37.420
 and that it's far from the scientific rigor

02:37.420 --> 02:40.880
 of something like physics, for example.

02:40.880 --> 02:43.640
 How do you think we can take psychology

02:43.640 --> 02:45.680
 from where it's been in the 20th century

02:45.680 --> 02:49.100
 to something more like what the physicists,

02:49.100 --> 02:50.460
 theoretical physicists are doing,

02:50.460 --> 02:52.380
 something precise, something rigorous?

02:52.380 --> 02:57.380
 Well, we could do it by finding

02:57.600 --> 03:01.200
 the physical foundations of psychology, right?

03:01.200 --> 03:05.840
 If all of our emotions and moods and feelings and behaviors

03:05.840 --> 03:10.840
 are the result of mechanical behaviors of atoms

03:11.120 --> 03:12.800
 and molecules in our brains,

03:12.800 --> 03:15.400
 then can we find correlations?

03:15.400 --> 03:17.760
 Perhaps like chaos makes that really difficult

03:17.760 --> 03:19.520
 and the uncertainty principle and all these things.

03:19.520 --> 03:22.760
 That we can't know the position and velocity

03:22.760 --> 03:27.140
 of every single quantum state in a brain, probably.

03:27.140 --> 03:32.140
 But I think that if we can get to that point with psychology,

03:33.560 --> 03:37.380
 then we can start to think about consciousness

03:37.380 --> 03:40.960
 in a physical and mathematical way.

03:40.960 --> 03:44.760
 When we ask questions like, well, what is self reference?

03:44.760 --> 03:47.320
 How can you think about yourself thinking?

03:47.320 --> 03:49.160
 What are some mathematical structures

03:49.160 --> 03:52.400
 that could bring that about?

03:52.400 --> 03:55.560
 There's ideas of, in terms of consciousness

03:55.560 --> 03:59.260
 and breaking it down into physics,

03:59.260 --> 04:02.400
 there's ideas of panpsychism where people believe

04:02.400 --> 04:04.840
 that whatever consciousness is,

04:04.840 --> 04:07.480
 is a fundamental part of reality.

04:07.480 --> 04:08.860
 It's almost like a physics law.

04:08.860 --> 04:11.560
 Do you think, what's your views on consciousness?

04:11.560 --> 04:15.600
 Do you think it has this deep part of reality

04:15.600 --> 04:17.840
 or is it something that's deeply human

04:17.840 --> 04:19.500
 and constructed by us humans?

04:21.640 --> 04:24.120
 Starting nice and light and easy.

04:25.120 --> 04:28.280
 Nothing I ask you today has actually proven answer.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.720
 So we're just hypothesizing.

04:29.720 --> 04:32.960
 So yeah, I mean, I should clarify, this is all speculation

04:32.960 --> 04:35.320
 and I'm not an expert in any of these topics

04:35.320 --> 04:39.840
 and I'm not God, but I think that consciousness

04:39.840 --> 04:44.840
 is probably something that can be fully explained

04:44.840 --> 04:48.280
 within the laws of physics.

04:48.280 --> 04:51.960
 I think that our bodies and brains and the universe

04:51.960 --> 04:56.280
 and at the quantum level is so rich and complex.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.560
 I'd be surprised if we couldn't find a room

04:58.560 --> 05:00.800
 for consciousness there.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.440
 And why should we be conscious?

05:04.440 --> 05:06.200
 Why are we aware of ourselves?

05:06.200 --> 05:10.400
 That is a very strange and interesting

05:10.400 --> 05:11.960
 and important question.

05:11.960 --> 05:15.640
 And I think for the next few thousand years,

05:15.640 --> 05:20.200
 we're going to have to believe in answers purely on faith.

05:20.200 --> 05:25.080
 But my guess is that we will find that,

05:25.080 --> 05:27.080
 within the configuration space

05:27.080 --> 05:29.860
 of possible arrangements of the universe,

05:29.860 --> 05:34.240
 there are some that contain memories of others.

05:34.240 --> 05:38.140
 Literally, Julian Barber calls them time capsule states

05:38.140 --> 05:40.400
 where you're like, yeah, not only do I have a scratch

05:40.400 --> 05:43.160
 on my arm, but also this state of the universe

05:43.160 --> 05:45.720
 also contains a memory in my head

05:45.720 --> 05:48.560
 of being scratched by my cat three days ago.

05:48.560 --> 05:52.940
 And for some reason, those kinds of states of the universe

05:52.940 --> 05:55.800
 are more plentiful or more likely.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.120
 When you say those states,

05:57.120 --> 06:00.000
 the ones that contain memories of its past

06:00.000 --> 06:02.760
 or ones that contain memories of its past

06:02.760 --> 06:05.400
 and have degrees of consciousness.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.640
 Just the first part, because I think the consciousness

06:08.640 --> 06:13.160
 then emerges from the fact that a state of the universe

06:13.160 --> 06:18.160
 that contains fragments or memories of other states

06:19.660 --> 06:22.560
 is one where you're going to feel like there's time.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.160
 You're going to feel like, yeah,

06:24.160 --> 06:26.400
 things happened in the past.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.980
 And I don't know what'll happen in the future

06:27.980 --> 06:29.600
 because these states don't contain information

06:29.600 --> 06:30.760
 about the future.

06:30.760 --> 06:34.000
 For some reason, those kinds of states

06:34.000 --> 06:38.240
 are either more common, more plentiful,

06:38.240 --> 06:40.840
 or you could use the anthropic principle and just say,

06:40.840 --> 06:42.480
 well, they're extremely rare,

06:42.480 --> 06:45.720
 but until you are in one, or if you are in one,

06:45.720 --> 06:46.860
 then you can ask questions,

06:46.860 --> 06:48.820
 like you're asking me on this podcast.

06:49.920 --> 06:50.760
 Why questions?

06:50.760 --> 06:52.560
 Yeah, it's like, why are we conscious?

06:52.560 --> 06:53.400
 Well, because if we weren't,

06:53.400 --> 06:55.240
 we wouldn't be asking why we were.

06:56.040 --> 06:59.480
 You've kind of implied that you have a sense,

06:59.480 --> 07:02.360
 again, hypothesis, theorizing

07:02.360 --> 07:05.560
 that the universe is deterministic.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.040
 What's your thoughts about free will?

07:08.040 --> 07:10.320
 Do you think of the universe as deterministic

07:10.320 --> 07:14.000
 in a sense that it's unrolling a particular,

07:14.000 --> 07:14.960
 like there's a,

07:14.960 --> 07:17.920
 it's operating under a specific set of physical laws.

07:17.920 --> 07:21.360
 And when you have to set the initial conditions,

07:21.360 --> 07:23.500
 it will unroll in the exact same way

07:23.500 --> 07:28.440
 in our particular line of the universe every time.

07:28.440 --> 07:31.600
 That is a very useful way to think about the universe.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.440
 It's done us well.

07:32.440 --> 07:33.740
 It's brought us to the moon.

07:33.740 --> 07:35.920
 It's brought us to where we are today, right?

07:35.920 --> 07:40.280
 I would not say that I believe in determinism

07:40.280 --> 07:43.200
 in that kind of an absolute form,

07:43.200 --> 07:45.560
 or actually I just don't care.

07:45.560 --> 07:46.720
 Maybe it's true,

07:46.720 --> 07:48.860
 but I'm not gonna live my life like it is.

07:49.920 --> 07:50.880
 What in your sense,

07:50.880 --> 07:54.120
 cause you've studied kind of how we humans

07:54.120 --> 07:55.820
 think of the world.

07:55.820 --> 07:59.240
 What's in your view is the difference between our perception,

07:59.240 --> 08:02.320
 like how we think the world is and reality.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.120
 Do you think there's a huge gap there?

08:04.120 --> 08:07.240
 Like we delude ourselves that the whole thing is an illusion.

08:07.240 --> 08:09.360
 Just everything about human psychology,

08:09.360 --> 08:12.880
 the way we see things and how things actually are.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.760
 All the things you've studied, what's your sense?

08:14.760 --> 08:16.920
 How big is the gap between reality and perception?

08:16.920 --> 08:18.920
 Well, again, purely speculative.

08:18.920 --> 08:20.960
 I think that we will never know the answer.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.600
 We cannot know the answer.

08:22.600 --> 08:26.960
 There is no experiment to find an answer to that question.

08:26.960 --> 08:30.240
 Everything we experience is an event in our brain.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.880
 When I look at a cat, I'm not even,

08:32.880 --> 08:36.660
 I can't prove that there's a cat there.

08:36.660 --> 08:40.900
 All I am experiencing is the perception of a cat

08:40.900 --> 08:43.100
 inside my own brain.

08:43.100 --> 08:46.300
 I am only a witness to the events of my mind.

08:46.300 --> 08:50.060
 I think it is very useful to infer that

08:50.060 --> 08:54.060
 if I witness the event of cat in my head,

08:54.060 --> 08:57.180
 it's because I'm looking at a cat that is literally there

08:57.180 --> 08:59.900
 and it has its own feelings and motivations

08:59.900 --> 09:03.100
 and should be pet and given food and water and love.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.940
 I think that's the way you should live your life.

09:05.940 --> 09:09.500
 But whether or not we live in a simulation,

09:09.500 --> 09:13.040
 I'm a brain in a vat, I don't know.

09:13.040 --> 09:13.880
 Do you care?

09:14.900 --> 09:16.800
 I don't really.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.580
 Well, I care because it's a fascinating question.

09:19.580 --> 09:22.600
 And it's a fantastic way to get people excited about

09:23.740 --> 09:26.260
 all kinds of topics, physics, psychology,

09:26.260 --> 09:28.100
 consciousness, philosophy.

09:28.100 --> 09:31.000
 But at the end of the day, what would the difference be?

09:31.000 --> 09:31.840
 If you...

09:31.840 --> 09:33.780
 The cat needs to be fed at the end of the day,

09:33.780 --> 09:35.620
 otherwise it'll be a dead cat.

09:35.620 --> 09:38.420
 Right, but if it's not even a real cat,

09:38.420 --> 09:40.320
 then it's just like a video game cat.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.040
 And right, so what's the difference between killing

09:43.040 --> 09:46.740
 a digital cat in a video game because of neglect

09:46.740 --> 09:48.320
 versus a real cat?

09:48.320 --> 09:50.540
 It seems very different to us psychologically.

09:50.540 --> 09:52.400
 Like I don't really feel bad about, oh my gosh,

09:52.400 --> 09:54.380
 I forgot to feed my Tamagotchi, right?

09:54.380 --> 09:55.780
 But I would feel terrible

09:55.780 --> 09:58.940
 if I forgot to feed my actual cats.

09:58.940 --> 10:03.420
 So can you just touch on the topic of simulation?

10:03.420 --> 10:06.220
 Do you find this thought experiment that we're living

10:06.220 --> 10:10.500
 in a simulation useful, inspiring or constructive

10:10.500 --> 10:11.580
 in any kind of way?

10:11.580 --> 10:12.980
 Do you think it's ridiculous?

10:12.980 --> 10:14.980
 Do you think it could be true?

10:14.980 --> 10:17.540
 Or is it just a useful thought experiment?

10:17.540 --> 10:20.920
 I think it is extremely useful as a thought experiment

10:20.920 --> 10:24.700
 because it makes sense to everyone,

10:24.700 --> 10:27.360
 especially as we see virtual reality

10:27.360 --> 10:30.580
 and computer games getting more and more complex.

10:30.580 --> 10:33.900
 You're not talking to an audience in like Newton's time

10:33.900 --> 10:36.660
 where you're like, imagine a clock

10:36.660 --> 10:38.820
 that it has mechanics in it that are so complex

10:38.820 --> 10:40.220
 that it can create love.

10:40.220 --> 10:42.380
 And everyone's like, no.

10:42.380 --> 10:46.540
 But today you really start to feel, man,

10:46.540 --> 10:48.960
 at what point is this little robot friend of mine

10:48.960 --> 10:53.960
 gonna be like someone I don't want to cancel plans with?

10:53.960 --> 10:58.960
 And so it's a great, the thought experiment

10:59.000 --> 11:00.280
 of do we live in a simulation?

11:00.280 --> 11:03.760
 Am I a brain in a vat that is just being given

11:03.760 --> 11:08.760
 electrical impulses from some nefarious other beings

11:08.960 --> 11:11.000
 so that I believe that I live on earth

11:11.000 --> 11:13.040
 and that I have a body and all of this?

11:13.040 --> 11:15.480
 And the fact that you can't prove it either way

11:15.480 --> 11:17.480
 is a fantastic way to introduce people

11:17.480 --> 11:19.800
 to some of the deepest questions.

11:20.760 --> 11:23.080
 So you mentioned a little buddy

11:23.080 --> 11:25.700
 that you would want to cancel an appointment with.

11:25.700 --> 11:27.800
 So that's a lot of our conversations.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.740
 That's what my research is, is artificial intelligence.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.520
 And I apologize, but you're such a fun person

11:34.520 --> 11:36.880
 to ask these big questions with.

11:36.880 --> 11:40.200
 Well, I hope I can give some answers that are interesting.

11:40.200 --> 11:45.200
 Well, because of you've sharpened your brain's ability

11:45.200 --> 11:47.940
 to explore some of the most, some of the questions

11:47.940 --> 11:51.120
 that many scientists are actually afraid of even touching,

11:51.120 --> 11:52.380
 which is fascinating.

11:52.380 --> 11:56.580
 I think you're in that sense ultimately a great scientist

11:56.580 --> 11:58.920
 through this process of sharpening your brain.

11:58.920 --> 12:01.740
 Well, I don't know if I am a scientist.

12:01.740 --> 12:04.920
 I think science is a way of knowing

12:04.920 --> 12:09.440
 and there are a lot of questions I investigate

12:09.440 --> 12:11.960
 that are not scientific questions.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.200
 On like mind field, we have definitely done

12:14.200 --> 12:17.680
 scientific experiments and studies that had hypotheses

12:17.680 --> 12:22.240
 and all of that, but not to be too like precious

12:22.240 --> 12:24.200
 about what does the word science mean?

12:24.200 --> 12:27.600
 But I think I would just describe myself as curious

12:27.600 --> 12:29.920
 and I hope that that curiosity is contagious.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.840
 So to you, the scientific method

12:31.840 --> 12:33.720
 is deeply connected to science

12:33.720 --> 12:38.280
 because your curiosity took you to asking questions.

12:38.280 --> 12:43.280
 To me, asking a good question, even if you feel,

12:43.440 --> 12:45.400
 society feels that it's not a question

12:45.400 --> 12:47.320
 within the reach of science currently.

12:47.320 --> 12:51.320
 To me, asking the question is the biggest step

12:51.320 --> 12:53.320
 of the scientific process.

12:53.320 --> 12:57.240
 The scientific method is the second part

12:57.240 --> 12:59.400
 and that may be what traditionally is called science,

12:59.400 --> 13:00.840
 but to me, asking the questions,

13:00.840 --> 13:03.000
 being brave enough to ask the questions,

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
 being curious and not constrained

13:05.000 --> 13:09.880
 by what you're supposed to think is just true,

13:09.880 --> 13:11.560
 what it means to be a scientist to me.

13:11.560 --> 13:15.260
 It's certainly a huge part of what it means to be a human.

13:16.380 --> 13:17.520
 If I were to say, you know what?

13:17.520 --> 13:19.080
 I don't believe in forces.

13:19.080 --> 13:22.120
 I think that when I push on a massive object,

13:22.120 --> 13:25.680
 a ghost leaves my body and enters the object I'm pushing

13:25.680 --> 13:28.040
 and these ghosts happen to just get really lazy

13:28.040 --> 13:29.760
 when they're around massive things

13:29.760 --> 13:31.200
 and that's why F equals MA.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.360
 Oh, and by the way, the laziness of the ghost

13:34.360 --> 13:36.320
 is in proportion to the mass of the object.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.760
 So boom, prove me wrong.

13:37.760 --> 13:41.060
 Every experiment, well, you can never find the ghost.

13:41.060 --> 13:45.880
 And so none of that theory is scientific,

13:45.880 --> 13:49.380
 but once I start saying, can I see the ghost?

13:49.380 --> 13:50.880
 Why should there be a ghost?

13:50.880 --> 13:53.100
 And if there aren't ghosts, what might I expect?

13:53.100 --> 13:56.540
 And I start to do different tests to see,

13:56.540 --> 13:58.000
 is this falsifiable?

13:59.120 --> 14:01.520
 Are there things that should happen if there are ghosts

14:01.520 --> 14:02.740
 or are there things that shouldn't happen?

14:02.740 --> 14:05.120
 And do they, you know, what do I observe?

14:05.120 --> 14:06.920
 Now I'm thinking scientifically.

14:06.920 --> 14:10.960
 I don't think of science as, wow, a picture of a black hole.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.240
 That's just a photograph.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.060
 That's an image.

14:13.060 --> 14:13.900
 That's data.

14:13.900 --> 14:16.480
 That's a sensory and perception experience.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.640
 Science is how we got that and how we understand it

14:19.640 --> 14:20.680
 and how we believe in it

14:20.680 --> 14:24.040
 and how we reduce our uncertainty around what it means.

14:24.040 --> 14:28.260
 But I would say I'm deeply within the scientific community

14:28.260 --> 14:31.600
 and I'm sometimes disheartened by the elitism

14:31.600 --> 14:34.640
 of the thinking, sort of not allowing yourself

14:34.640 --> 14:36.280
 to think outside the box.

14:36.280 --> 14:37.880
 So allowing the possibility

14:37.880 --> 14:40.040
 of going against the conventions of science,

14:40.040 --> 14:43.920
 I think is a beautiful part of some

14:43.920 --> 14:46.280
 of the greatest scientists in history.

14:46.280 --> 14:49.840
 I don't know, I'm impressed by scientists every day

14:49.840 --> 14:54.840
 and revolutions in our knowledge of the world occur

14:58.480 --> 15:00.760
 only under very special circumstances.

15:00.760 --> 15:05.680
 It is very scary to challenge conventional thinking

15:05.680 --> 15:10.440
 and risky because let's go back to elitism and ego, right?

15:10.440 --> 15:11.440
 If you just say, you know what?

15:11.440 --> 15:14.000
 I believe in the spirits of my body

15:14.000 --> 15:17.900
 and all forces are actually created by invisible creatures

15:17.900 --> 15:21.160
 that transfer themselves between objects.

15:22.360 --> 15:26.680
 If you ridicule every other theory

15:26.680 --> 15:28.800
 and say that you're correct,

15:28.800 --> 15:31.680
 then ego gets involved and you just don't go anywhere.

15:31.680 --> 15:35.640
 But fundamentally the question of well, what is a force

15:36.800 --> 15:38.560
 is incredibly important.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.040
 We need to have that conversation,

15:40.040 --> 15:42.640
 but it needs to be done in this very political way

15:42.640 --> 15:44.640
 of like, let's be respectful of everyone

15:44.640 --> 15:46.920
 and let's realize that we're all learning together

15:46.920 --> 15:49.000
 and not shutting out other people.

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
 And so when you look at a lot of revolutionary ideas,

15:54.720 --> 15:57.460
 they were not accepted right away.

15:57.460 --> 16:00.560
 And, you know, Galileo had a couple of problems

16:00.560 --> 16:04.800
 with the authorities and later thinkers, Descartes,

16:04.800 --> 16:06.980
 was like, all right, look, I kind of agree with Galileo,

16:06.980 --> 16:11.380
 but I'm gonna have to not say that.

16:11.380 --> 16:13.740
 I'll have to create and invent and write different things

16:13.740 --> 16:15.100
 that keep me from being in trouble,

16:15.100 --> 16:17.320
 but we still slowly made progress.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.240
 Revolutions are difficult in all forms

16:19.240 --> 16:20.480
 and certainly in science.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.840
 Before we get to AI, on topic of revolutionary ideas,

16:23.840 --> 16:28.840
 let me ask on a Reddit AMA, you said that is the earth flat

16:28.840 --> 16:31.600
 is one of the favorite questions you've ever answered,

16:31.600 --> 16:33.640
 speaking of revolutionary ideas.

16:33.640 --> 16:37.080
 So your video on that, people should definitely watch,

16:37.080 --> 16:38.820
 is really fascinating.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.660
 Can you elaborate why you enjoyed

16:41.660 --> 16:43.800
 answering this question so much?

16:43.800 --> 16:45.620
 Yeah, well, it's a long story.

16:45.620 --> 16:49.380
 I remember a long time ago,

16:49.380 --> 16:50.940
 I was living in New York at the time,

16:50.940 --> 16:54.000
 so it had to have been like 2009 or something.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.600
 I visited the Flat Earth forums

16:57.600 --> 17:00.280
 and this was before the Flat Earth theories

17:00.280 --> 17:03.160
 became as sort of mainstream as they are.

17:03.160 --> 17:06.720
 Sorry to ask the dumb question, forums, online forums.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.040
 Yeah, the Flat Earth Society,

17:09.040 --> 17:11.200
 I don't know if it's.com or.org, but I went there

17:11.200 --> 17:14.200
 and I was reading their ideas

17:14.200 --> 17:17.880
 and how they responded to typical criticisms of,

17:17.880 --> 17:20.280
 well, the earth isn't flat because what about this?

17:20.280 --> 17:23.760
 And I could not tell, and I mentioned this in my video,

17:23.760 --> 17:28.640
 I couldn't tell how many of these community members

17:28.640 --> 17:32.400
 actually believe the earth was flat or we're just trolling.

17:32.400 --> 17:36.320
 And I realized that the fascinating thing is,

17:36.320 --> 17:38.480
 how do we know anything?

17:38.480 --> 17:41.640
 And what makes for a good belief

17:41.640 --> 17:45.240
 versus a maybe not so tenable or good belief?

17:45.240 --> 17:47.560
 And so that's really what my video

17:47.560 --> 17:49.920
 about earth being flat is about.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.320
 It's about, look, there are a lot of reasons

17:52.320 --> 17:55.680
 that the earth is probably not flat,

17:57.000 --> 18:00.600
 but a Flat Earth believer can respond

18:00.600 --> 18:04.120
 to every single one of them, but it's all in an ad hoc way.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.760
 And all of these, all of their rebuttals

18:05.760 --> 18:07.040
 aren't necessarily gonna form

18:07.040 --> 18:10.760
 a cohesive noncontradictory whole.

18:10.760 --> 18:12.520
 And I believe that's the episode

18:12.520 --> 18:14.960
 where I talk about Occam's razor

18:14.960 --> 18:17.400
 and Newton's flaming laser sword.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.480
 And then I say, well, you know what, wait a second.

18:19.480 --> 18:24.480
 We know that space contracts as you move.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.200
 And so to a particle moving near the speed of light

18:27.200 --> 18:29.560
 towards earth, earth would be flattened

18:29.560 --> 18:32.200
 in the direction of that particles travel.

18:32.200 --> 18:35.520
 So to them, earth is flat.

18:35.520 --> 18:40.520
 Like we need to be really generous to even wild ideas

18:41.000 --> 18:43.800
 because they're all thinking,

18:43.800 --> 18:45.840
 they're all the communication of ideas.

18:45.840 --> 18:48.240
 And what else can it mean to be a human?

18:48.240 --> 18:50.960
 Yeah, and I think I'm a huge fan

18:50.960 --> 18:54.880
 of the Flat Earth theory, quote unquote,

18:54.880 --> 18:57.520
 in the sense that to me it feels harmless

18:57.520 --> 18:59.000
 to explore some of the questions

18:59.000 --> 19:00.480
 of what it means to believe something,

19:00.480 --> 19:05.000
 what it means to explore the edge of science and so on.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.160
 Cause it's a harm, it's a, to me,

19:07.160 --> 19:09.680
 nobody gets hurt whether the earth is flat or round,

19:09.680 --> 19:11.840
 not literally, but I mean intellectually

19:11.840 --> 19:13.360
 when we're just having a conversation.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.760
 That said, again, to elitism,

19:15.760 --> 19:18.640
 I find that scientists roll their eyes

19:18.640 --> 19:21.400
 way too fast on the Flat Earth.

19:21.400 --> 19:25.520
 The kind of dismissal that I see to this even notion,

19:25.520 --> 19:27.760
 they haven't like sat down and say,

19:27.760 --> 19:30.120
 what are the arguments that are being proposed?

19:30.120 --> 19:32.600
 And this is why these arguments are incorrect.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.040
 So that should be something

19:35.040 --> 19:37.480
 that scientists should always do,

19:37.480 --> 19:42.160
 even to the most sort of ideas that seem ridiculous.

19:42.160 --> 19:45.880
 So I like this as almost, it's almost my test

19:45.880 --> 19:48.440
 when I ask people what they think about Flat Earth theory,

19:48.440 --> 19:51.080
 to see how quickly they roll their eyes.

19:51.080 --> 19:53.880
 Well, yeah, I mean, let me go on record

19:53.880 --> 19:58.400
 and say that the earth is not flat.

19:58.400 --> 20:02.040
 It is a three dimensional spheroid.

20:02.040 --> 20:07.000
 However, I don't know that and it has not been proven.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.800
 Science doesn't prove anything.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.680
 It just reduces uncertainty.

20:10.680 --> 20:12.320
 Could the earth actually be flat?

20:13.960 --> 20:18.960
 Extremely unlikely, extremely unlikely.

20:19.040 --> 20:21.640
 And so it is a ridiculous notion

20:21.640 --> 20:26.640
 if we care about how probable and certain our ideas might be.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.400
 But I think it's incredibly important

20:28.400 --> 20:32.120
 to talk about science in that way

20:32.120 --> 20:35.280
 and to not resort to, well, it's true.

20:35.280 --> 20:39.880
 It's true in the same way that a mathematical theorem

20:39.880 --> 20:41.280
 is true.

20:41.280 --> 20:46.280
 And I think we're kind of like being pretty pedantic

20:46.520 --> 20:48.400
 about defining this stuff.

20:48.400 --> 20:51.680
 But like, sure, I could take a rocket ship out

20:51.680 --> 20:53.680
 and I could orbit earth and look at it

20:53.680 --> 20:55.840
 and it would look like a ball, right?

20:56.880 --> 20:59.360
 But I still can't prove that I'm not living in a simulation,

20:59.360 --> 21:00.520
 that I'm not a brain in a vat,

21:00.520 --> 21:02.640
 that this isn't all an elaborate ruse

21:02.640 --> 21:04.600
 created by some technologically advanced

21:04.600 --> 21:06.520
 extraterrestrial civilization.

21:06.520 --> 21:11.000
 So there's always some doubt and that's fine.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.280
 That's exciting.

21:12.280 --> 21:14.840
 And I think that kind of doubt, practically speaking,

21:14.840 --> 21:17.720
 is useful when you start talking about quantum mechanics

21:17.720 --> 21:20.360
 or string theory, sort of, it helps.

21:20.360 --> 21:23.200
 To me, that kind of adds a little spice

21:23.200 --> 21:26.440
 into the thinking process of scientists.

21:26.440 --> 21:30.040
 So, I mean, just as a thought experiment,

21:30.040 --> 21:33.400
 your video kind of, okay, say the earth is flat.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.640
 What would the forces when you walk about this flat earth

21:36.640 --> 21:38.360
 feel like to the human?

21:38.360 --> 21:40.600
 That's a really nice thought experiment to think about.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.440
 Right, because what's really nice about it

21:42.440 --> 21:45.400
 is that it's a funny thought experiment,

21:45.400 --> 21:48.040
 but you actually wind up accidentally learning

21:48.040 --> 21:51.640
 a whole lot about gravity and about relativity

21:51.640 --> 21:53.240
 and geometry.

21:53.240 --> 21:56.280
 And I think that's really the goal of what I'm doing.

21:56.280 --> 21:57.640
 I'm not trying to like convince people

21:57.640 --> 21:58.840
 that the earth is round.

21:58.840 --> 22:01.280
 I feel like you either believe that it is or you don't

22:01.280 --> 22:04.680
 and like, that's, you know, how can I change that?

22:04.680 --> 22:06.920
 What I can do is change how you think

22:06.920 --> 22:10.920
 and how you are introduced to important concepts.

22:10.920 --> 22:13.760
 Like, well, how does gravity operate?

22:13.760 --> 22:16.480
 Oh, it's all about the center of mass of an object.

22:16.480 --> 22:19.480
 So right, on a sphere, we're all pulled towards the middle,

22:19.480 --> 22:21.440
 essentially the centroid geometrically,

22:21.440 --> 22:24.560
 but on a disc, ooh, you're gonna be pulled at a weird angle

22:24.560 --> 22:25.920
 if you're out near the edge.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.400
 And that stuff's fascinating.

22:28.400 --> 22:32.880
 Yeah, and to me, that was, that particular video

22:34.520 --> 22:37.520
 opened my eyes even more to what gravity is.

22:37.520 --> 22:40.040
 It's just a really nice visualization tool of,

22:40.040 --> 22:43.080
 because you always imagine gravity with spheres,

22:43.080 --> 22:44.600
 with masses that are spheres.

22:44.600 --> 22:45.440
 Yeah.

22:45.440 --> 22:48.280
 And imagining gravity on masses that are not spherical,

22:48.280 --> 22:53.280
 some other shape, but in here, a plate, a flat object,

22:53.400 --> 22:54.240
 is really interesting.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.280
 It makes you really kind of visualize

22:56.280 --> 22:57.800
 in a three dimensional way the force of gravity.

22:57.800 --> 23:02.800
 Yeah, even if a disc the size of Earth would be impossible,

23:05.880 --> 23:09.040
 I think anything larger than like the moon basically

23:09.040 --> 23:13.760
 needs to be a sphere because gravity will round it out.

23:15.240 --> 23:18.120
 So you can't have a teacup the size of Jupiter, right?

23:18.120 --> 23:21.040
 There's a great book about the teacup in the universe

23:21.040 --> 23:22.920
 that I highly recommend.

23:22.920 --> 23:24.720
 I don't remember the author.

23:24.720 --> 23:26.800
 I forget her name, but it's a wonderful book.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.200
 So look it up.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.200
 I think it's called Teacup in the Universe.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.680
 Just to link on this point briefly,

23:32.680 --> 23:37.120
 your videos are generally super, people love them, right?

23:37.120 --> 23:39.600
 If you look at the sort of number of likes versus dislikes

23:39.600 --> 23:43.140
 is this measure of YouTube, right, is incredible.

23:43.140 --> 23:45.240
 And as do I.

23:45.240 --> 23:48.160
 But this particular flat Earth video

23:48.160 --> 23:51.800
 has more dislikes than usual.

23:51.800 --> 23:55.320
 What do you, on that topic in general,

23:55.320 --> 23:58.800
 what's your sense, how big is the community,

23:58.800 --> 24:00.740
 not just who believes in flat Earth,

24:00.740 --> 24:03.720
 but sort of the anti scientific community

24:03.720 --> 24:08.200
 that naturally distrust scientists in a way

24:08.200 --> 24:12.200
 that's not an open minded way,

24:12.200 --> 24:13.720
 like really just distrust scientists

24:13.720 --> 24:17.040
 like they're bought by some kind of mechanism

24:17.040 --> 24:18.880
 of some kind of bigger system

24:18.880 --> 24:21.080
 that's trying to manipulate human beings.

24:21.080 --> 24:24.040
 What's your sense of the size of that community?

24:24.040 --> 24:28.960
 You're one of the sort of great educators in the world

24:28.960 --> 24:33.960
 that educates people on the exciting power of science.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.080
 So you're kind of up against this community.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.960
 What's your sense of it?

24:39.960 --> 24:41.960
 I really have no idea.

24:41.960 --> 24:44.200
 I haven't looked at the likes and dislikes

24:44.200 --> 24:45.320
 on the flat Earth video.

24:45.320 --> 24:49.100
 And so I would wonder if it has a greater percentage

24:49.100 --> 24:51.340
 of dislikes than usual,

24:51.340 --> 24:53.520
 is that because of people disliking it

24:53.520 --> 24:56.720
 because they think that it's a video

24:56.720 --> 25:01.260
 about Earth being flat and they find that ridiculous

25:01.260 --> 25:04.200
 and they dislike it without even really watching much?

25:04.200 --> 25:07.360
 Do they wish that I was more like dismissive

25:07.360 --> 25:08.560
 of flat Earth theories?

25:08.560 --> 25:09.760
 Yeah.

25:09.760 --> 25:10.600
 That's possible too.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.080
 I know there are a lot of response videos

25:12.080 --> 25:17.080
 that kind of go through the episode and are pro flat Earth,

25:18.600 --> 25:21.860
 but I don't know if there's a larger community

25:21.860 --> 25:25.120
 of unorthodox thinkers today

25:25.120 --> 25:27.440
 than there have been in the past.

25:27.440 --> 25:29.960
 And I just wanna not lose them.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.580
 I want them to keep listening and thinking

25:32.580 --> 25:36.640
 and by calling them all idiots or something,

25:36.640 --> 25:41.020
 that does no good because how idiotic are they really?

25:41.020 --> 25:45.300
 I mean, the Earth isn't a sphere at all.

25:45.300 --> 25:47.720
 We know that it's an oblate spheroid

25:47.720 --> 25:50.340
 and that in and of itself is really interesting.

25:50.340 --> 25:52.240
 And I investigated that in which way is down

25:52.240 --> 25:54.200
 where I'm like, really down does not point

25:54.200 --> 25:56.240
 towards the center of the Earth.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.920
 It points in different direction,

25:58.920 --> 26:01.640
 depending on what's underneath you and what's above you

26:01.640 --> 26:02.480
 and what's around you.

26:02.480 --> 26:06.000
 The whole universe is tugging on me.

26:06.000 --> 26:10.080
 And then you also show that gravity is non uniform

26:10.080 --> 26:11.680
 across the globe.

26:11.680 --> 26:14.400
 Like if you, there's this I guess thought experiment

26:14.400 --> 26:19.400
 if you build a bridge all the way across the Earth

26:19.400 --> 26:23.440
 and then just knock out its pillars, what would happen?

26:23.440 --> 26:27.080
 And you describe how it would be like a very chaotic,

26:27.080 --> 26:28.960
 unstable thing that's happening

26:28.960 --> 26:31.760
 because gravity is non uniform throughout the Earth.

26:31.760 --> 26:36.620
 Yeah, in small spaces, like the ones we work in,

26:36.620 --> 26:39.320
 we can essentially assume that gravity is uniform,

26:39.320 --> 26:40.880
 but it's not.

26:40.880 --> 26:43.040
 It is weaker the further you are from the Earth.

26:43.040 --> 26:47.080
 And it also is going to be,

26:47.080 --> 26:50.060
 it's radially pointed towards the middle of the Earth.

26:50.060 --> 26:54.160
 So a really large object will feel tidal forces

26:54.160 --> 26:55.640
 because of that non uniformness.

26:55.640 --> 26:58.500
 And we can take advantage of that with satellites, right?

26:58.500 --> 27:00.280
 Gravitational induced torque.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.680
 It's a great way to align your satellite

27:01.680 --> 27:05.560
 without having to use fuel or any kind of engine.

27:05.560 --> 27:08.320
 So let's jump back to it, artificial intelligence.

27:08.320 --> 27:11.180
 What's your thought of the state of where we are at

27:11.180 --> 27:12.920
 currently with artificial intelligence

27:12.920 --> 27:15.880
 and what do you think it takes to build human level

27:15.880 --> 27:17.960
 or superhuman level intelligence?

27:17.960 --> 27:20.400
 I don't know what intelligence means.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.840
 That's my biggest question at the moment.

27:22.840 --> 27:25.080
 And I think it's because my instinct is always to go,

27:25.080 --> 27:28.000
 well, what are the foundations here of our discussion?

27:28.000 --> 27:31.080
 What does it mean to be intelligent?

27:31.080 --> 27:35.320
 How do we measure the intelligence of an artificial machine

27:35.320 --> 27:37.480
 or a program or something?

27:37.480 --> 27:39.880
 Can we say that humans are intelligent?

27:39.880 --> 27:42.600
 Because there's also a fascinating field

27:42.600 --> 27:44.280
 of how do you measure human intelligence.

27:44.280 --> 27:45.360
 Of course.

27:45.360 --> 27:47.080
 But if we just take that for granted,

27:47.080 --> 27:50.000
 saying that whatever this fuzzy intelligence thing

27:50.000 --> 27:52.200
 we're talking about, humans kind of have it.

27:53.080 --> 27:56.680
 What would be a good test for you?

27:56.680 --> 27:59.160
 So during develop a test that's natural language

27:59.160 --> 28:01.600
 conversation, would that impress you?

28:01.600 --> 28:03.360
 A chat bot that you'd want to hang out

28:03.360 --> 28:06.600
 and have a beer with for a bunch of hours

28:06.600 --> 28:08.360
 or have dinner plans with.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.240
 Is that a good test, natural language conversation?

28:10.240 --> 28:12.260
 Is there something else that would impress you?

28:12.260 --> 28:13.640
 Or is that also too difficult to think about?

28:13.640 --> 28:16.120
 Oh yeah, I'm pretty much impressed by everything.

28:16.120 --> 28:20.320
 I think that if there was a chat bot

28:20.320 --> 28:23.360
 that was like incredibly, I don't know,

28:23.360 --> 28:24.460
 really had a personality.

28:24.460 --> 28:27.940
 And if I didn't be the Turing test, right?

28:27.940 --> 28:32.940
 Like if I'm unable to tell that it's not another person

28:33.360 --> 28:36.560
 but then I was shown a bunch of wires

28:36.560 --> 28:39.060
 and mechanical components.

28:39.060 --> 28:42.680
 And it was like, that's actually what you're talking to.

28:42.680 --> 28:46.440
 I don't know if I would feel that guilty destroying it.

28:46.440 --> 28:49.240
 I would feel guilty because clearly it's well made

28:49.240 --> 28:51.040
 and it's a really cool thing.

28:51.040 --> 28:53.800
 It's like destroying a really cool car or something

28:53.800 --> 28:56.280
 but I would not feel like I was a murderer.

28:56.280 --> 28:58.800
 So yeah, at what point would I start to feel that way?

28:58.800 --> 29:02.680
 And this is such a subjective psychological question.

29:02.680 --> 29:07.680
 If you give it movement or if you have it act as though

29:07.680 --> 29:11.840
 or perhaps really feel pain as I destroy it

29:11.840 --> 29:15.640
 and scream and resist, then I'd feel bad.

29:15.640 --> 29:16.680
 Yeah, it's beautifully put.

29:16.680 --> 29:20.480
 And let's just say act like it's a pain.

29:20.480 --> 29:25.480
 So if you just have a robot that not screams,

29:25.640 --> 29:28.440
 just like moans in pain if you kick it,

29:28.440 --> 29:30.920
 that immediately just puts it in a class

29:30.920 --> 29:35.280
 that we humans, it becomes, we anthropomorphize it.

29:35.280 --> 29:37.920
 It almost immediately becomes human.

29:37.920 --> 29:39.320
 So that's a psychology question

29:39.320 --> 29:40.920
 as opposed to sort of a physics question.

29:40.920 --> 29:43.080
 Right, I think that's a really good instinct to have.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.080
 If the robot.

29:45.720 --> 29:46.560
 Screams.

29:46.560 --> 29:50.160
 Screams and moans, even if you don't believe

29:50.160 --> 29:52.640
 that it has the mental experience,

29:52.640 --> 29:55.280
 the qualia of pain and suffering,

29:55.280 --> 29:56.760
 I think it's still a good instinct to say,

29:56.760 --> 29:59.960
 you know what, I'd rather not hurt it.

29:59.960 --> 30:02.560
 The problem is that instinct can get us in trouble

30:02.560 --> 30:05.560
 because then robots can manipulate that.

30:05.560 --> 30:08.240
 And there's different kinds of robots.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.640
 There's robots like the Facebook and the YouTube algorithm

30:10.640 --> 30:11.920
 that recommends the video,

30:11.920 --> 30:14.440
 and they can manipulate in the same kind of way.

30:14.440 --> 30:16.240
 Well, let me ask you just to stick

30:16.240 --> 30:17.840
 on artificial intelligence for a second.

30:17.840 --> 30:21.720
 Do you have worries about existential threats from AI

30:21.720 --> 30:23.680
 or existential threats from other technologies

30:23.680 --> 30:27.720
 like nuclear weapons that could potentially destroy life

30:27.720 --> 30:31.200
 on earth or damage it to a very significant degree?

30:31.200 --> 30:32.280
 Yeah, of course I do.

30:32.280 --> 30:35.280
 Especially the weapons that we create.

30:35.280 --> 30:38.080
 There's all kinds of famous ways to think about this.

30:38.080 --> 30:41.440
 And one is that, wow, what if we don't see

30:41.440 --> 30:46.440
 advanced alien civilizations because of the danger

30:46.800 --> 30:50.600
 of technology?

30:50.600 --> 30:51.800
 What if we reach a point,

30:51.800 --> 30:55.000
 and I think there's a channel, Thoughty2,

30:55.000 --> 30:57.400
 geez, I wish I remembered the name of the channel,

30:57.400 --> 30:59.960
 but he delves into this kind of limit

30:59.960 --> 31:04.960
 of maybe once you discover radioactivity and its power,

31:04.960 --> 31:07.160
 you've reached this important hurdle.

31:07.160 --> 31:09.400
 And the reason that the skies are so empty

31:09.400 --> 31:13.880
 is that no one's ever managed to survive as a civilization

31:13.880 --> 31:16.840
 once they have that destructive power.

31:16.840 --> 31:21.840
 And when it comes to AI, I'm not really very worried

31:22.320 --> 31:24.760
 because I think that there are plenty of other people

31:24.760 --> 31:26.440
 that are already worried enough.

31:26.440 --> 31:30.520
 And oftentimes these worries are just,

31:30.520 --> 31:32.880
 they just get in the way of progress.

31:32.880 --> 31:36.680
 And they're questions that we should address later.

31:37.680 --> 31:41.960
 And I think I talk about this in my interview

31:41.960 --> 31:46.960
 with the self driving autonomous vehicle guy,

31:47.440 --> 31:48.640
 as I think it was a bonus scene

31:48.640 --> 31:52.080
 from the trolley problem episode.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.200
 And I'm like, wow, what should a car do

31:54.200 --> 31:56.960
 if this really weird contrived scenario happens

31:56.960 --> 32:00.120
 where it has to swerve and save the driver, but kill a kid?

32:00.120 --> 32:03.440
 And he's like, well, what would a human do?

32:03.440 --> 32:07.200
 And if we resist technological progress

32:07.200 --> 32:10.360
 because we're worried about all of these little issues,

32:10.360 --> 32:11.960
 then it gets in the way.

32:11.960 --> 32:14.320
 And we shouldn't avoid those problems,

32:14.320 --> 32:16.760
 but we shouldn't allow them to be stumbling blocks

32:16.760 --> 32:18.920
 to advancement.

32:18.920 --> 32:22.440
 So the folks like Sam Harris or Elon Musk

32:22.440 --> 32:24.520
 are saying that we're not worried enough.

32:24.520 --> 32:28.520
 So the worry should not paralyze technological progress,

32:28.520 --> 32:30.760
 but we're sort of marching,

32:30.760 --> 32:35.760
 technology is marching forward without the key scientists,

32:35.800 --> 32:37.880
 the developing of technology,

32:37.880 --> 32:42.080
 worrying about the overnight having some effects

32:42.080 --> 32:45.200
 that would be very detrimental to society.

32:45.200 --> 32:49.520
 So to push back on your thought of the idea

32:49.520 --> 32:51.240
 that there's enough people worrying about it,

32:51.240 --> 32:53.040
 Elon Musk says, there's not enough people

32:53.040 --> 32:54.640
 worrying about it.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.580
 That's the kind of balance is,

32:58.960 --> 33:01.240
 it's like folks who are really focused

33:01.240 --> 33:03.680
 on nuclear deterrence are saying

33:03.680 --> 33:04.840
 there's not enough people worried

33:04.840 --> 33:06.080
 about nuclear deterrence, right?

33:06.080 --> 33:10.220
 So it's an interesting question of what is a good threshold

33:10.220 --> 33:12.600
 of people to worry about these?

33:12.600 --> 33:15.160
 And if it's too many people that are worried, you're right.

33:15.160 --> 33:18.720
 It'll be like the press would over report on it

33:18.720 --> 33:21.840
 and there'll be technological, halt technological progress.

33:21.840 --> 33:24.440
 If not enough, then we can march straight ahead

33:24.440 --> 33:29.440
 into that abyss that human beings might be destined for

33:29.840 --> 33:31.320
 with the progress of technology.

33:31.320 --> 33:33.680
 Yeah, I don't know what the right balance is

33:33.680 --> 33:35.720
 of how many people should be worried

33:35.720 --> 33:36.960
 and how worried should they be,

33:36.960 --> 33:40.440
 but we're always worried about new technology.

33:40.440 --> 33:42.960
 We know that Plato was worried about the written word.

33:42.960 --> 33:45.000
 He was like, we shouldn't teach people to write

33:45.000 --> 33:48.360
 because then they won't use their minds to remember things.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.240
 There have been concerns over technology

33:51.240 --> 33:55.120
 and its advancement since the beginning of recorded history.

33:55.120 --> 33:58.880
 And so, I think, however,

33:58.880 --> 34:01.060
 these conversations are really important to have

34:01.060 --> 34:03.360
 because again, we learn a lot about ourselves.

34:03.360 --> 34:06.200
 If we're really scared of some kind of AI

34:06.200 --> 34:09.360
 like coming into being that is conscious or whatever

34:09.360 --> 34:13.120
 and can self replicate, we already do that every day.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.560
 It's called humans being born.

34:14.560 --> 34:17.200
 They're not artificial, they're humans,

34:17.200 --> 34:20.140
 but they're intelligent and I don't wanna live in a world

34:20.140 --> 34:21.940
 where we're worried about babies being born

34:21.940 --> 34:24.200
 because what if they become evil?

34:24.200 --> 34:25.040
 Right.

34:25.040 --> 34:25.920
 What if they become mean people?

34:25.920 --> 34:27.680
 What if they're thieves?

34:27.680 --> 34:31.760
 Maybe we should just like, what, not have babies born?

34:31.760 --> 34:33.980
 Like maybe we shouldn't create AI.

34:33.980 --> 34:38.980
 It's like, we will want to have safeguards in place

34:39.720 --> 34:41.740
 in the same way that we know, look,

34:41.740 --> 34:44.400
 a kid could be born that becomes some kind of evil person,

34:44.400 --> 34:47.880
 but we have laws, right?

34:47.880 --> 34:51.600
 And it's possible that with advanced genetics in general,

34:51.600 --> 34:56.600
 be able to, it's a scary thought to say that,

34:58.400 --> 35:03.400
 this, my child, if born would have an 83% chance

35:05.200 --> 35:08.720
 of being a psychopath, right?

35:08.720 --> 35:11.500
 Like being able to, if it's something genetic,

35:11.500 --> 35:15.040
 if there's some sort of, and what to use that information,

35:15.040 --> 35:16.200
 what to do with that information

35:16.200 --> 35:20.000
 is a difficult ethical thought.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.040
 Yeah, and I'd like to find an answer that isn't,

35:22.040 --> 35:24.940
 well, let's not have them live.

35:24.940 --> 35:26.860
 You know, I'd like to find an answer that is,

35:26.860 --> 35:30.340
 well, all human life is worthy.

35:30.340 --> 35:33.640
 And if you have an 83% chance of becoming a psychopath,

35:33.640 --> 35:38.140
 well, you still deserve dignity.

35:38.140 --> 35:42.400
 And you still deserve to be treated well.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.360
 You still have rights.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.980
 At least at this part of the world, at least in America,

35:45.980 --> 35:49.540
 there's a respect for individual life in that way.

35:49.540 --> 35:54.040
 That's, well, to me, but again, I'm in this bubble,

35:54.040 --> 35:55.760
 is a beautiful thing.

35:55.760 --> 35:59.020
 But there's other cultures where individual human life

35:59.020 --> 36:02.720
 is not that important, where a society,

36:02.720 --> 36:04.760
 so I was born in the Soviet Union,

36:04.760 --> 36:07.440
 where the strength of nation and society together

36:07.440 --> 36:10.280
 is more important than any one particular individual.

36:10.280 --> 36:12.080
 So it's an interesting also notion,

36:12.080 --> 36:13.540
 the stories we tell ourselves.

36:13.540 --> 36:16.000
 I like the one where individuals matter,

36:16.000 --> 36:19.200
 but it's unclear that that was what the future holds.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.480
 Well, yeah, and I mean, let me even throw this out.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.840
 Like, what is artificial intelligence?

36:23.840 --> 36:25.200
 How can it be artificial?

36:25.200 --> 36:28.000
 I really think that we get pretty obsessed

36:28.000 --> 36:30.740
 and stuck on the idea that there is some thing

36:30.740 --> 36:34.320
 that is a wild human, a pure human organism

36:34.320 --> 36:35.780
 without technology.

36:35.780 --> 36:37.540
 But I don't think that's a real thing.

36:37.540 --> 36:42.540
 I think that humans and human technology are one organism.

36:42.780 --> 36:44.500
 Look at my glasses, okay?

36:44.500 --> 36:47.860
 If an alien came down and saw me,

36:47.860 --> 36:50.620
 would they necessarily know that this is an invention,

36:50.620 --> 36:53.220
 that I don't grow these organically from my body?

36:53.220 --> 36:55.460
 They wouldn't know that right away.

36:55.460 --> 37:00.460
 And the written word, and spoons, and cups,

37:00.460 --> 37:02.460
 these are all pieces of technology.

37:02.460 --> 37:06.700
 We are not alone as an organism.

37:06.700 --> 37:09.060
 And so the technology we create,

37:09.060 --> 37:11.980
 whether it be video games or artificial intelligence

37:11.980 --> 37:14.020
 that can self replicate and hate us,

37:14.020 --> 37:16.780
 it's actually all the same organism.

37:16.780 --> 37:19.220
 When you're in a car, where do you end in the car begin?

37:19.220 --> 37:21.100
 It seems like a really easy question to answer,

37:21.100 --> 37:22.660
 but the more you think about it,

37:22.660 --> 37:23.900
 the more you realize, wow,

37:23.900 --> 37:27.940
 we are in this symbiotic relationship with our inventions.

37:27.940 --> 37:30.020
 And there are plenty of people who are worried about it.

37:30.020 --> 37:30.860
 And there should be,

37:30.860 --> 37:32.820
 but it's inevitable.

37:32.820 --> 37:35.900
 And I think that even just us think of ourselves

37:35.900 --> 37:40.900
 as individual intelligences may be silly notion

37:41.380 --> 37:44.540
 because it's much better to think

37:44.540 --> 37:46.780
 of the entirety of human civilization.

37:46.780 --> 37:50.740
 All living organisms on earth is a single living organism.

37:50.740 --> 37:52.180
 As a single intelligent creature,

37:52.180 --> 37:54.340
 because you're right, everything's intertwined.

37:54.340 --> 37:57.100
 Everything is deeply connected.

37:57.100 --> 37:57.940
 So we mentioned, you know,

37:57.940 --> 38:02.940
 Musk, so you're a curious lover of science.

38:03.140 --> 38:06.860
 What do you think of the efforts that Elon Musk is doing

38:06.860 --> 38:10.100
 with space exploration, with electric vehicles,

38:10.100 --> 38:13.620
 with autopilot, sort of getting into the space

38:13.620 --> 38:17.300
 of autonomous vehicles, with boring under LA

38:17.300 --> 38:21.740
 and a Neuralink trying to communicate brain machine

38:21.740 --> 38:24.260
 interfaces, communicate between machines

38:24.260 --> 38:28.540
 and human brains?

38:28.540 --> 38:30.140
 Well, it's really inspiring.

38:30.140 --> 38:34.860
 I mean, look at the fandom that he's amassed.

38:34.860 --> 38:39.220
 It's not common for someone like that

38:39.220 --> 38:40.620
 to have such a following.

38:40.620 --> 38:42.420
 And so it's... Engineering nerd.

38:42.420 --> 38:44.580
 Yeah, so it's really exciting.

38:44.580 --> 38:46.420
 But I also think that a lot of responsibility

38:46.420 --> 38:47.660
 comes with that kind of power.

38:47.660 --> 38:50.860
 So like if I met him, I would love to hear how he feels

38:50.860 --> 38:53.420
 about the responsibility he has.

38:53.420 --> 38:58.420
 When there are people who are such a fan of your ideas

38:59.980 --> 39:04.620
 and your dreams and share them so closely with you,

39:04.620 --> 39:06.420
 you have a lot of power.

39:06.420 --> 39:09.660
 And he didn't always have that, you know?

39:09.660 --> 39:11.980
 He wasn't born as Elon Musk.

39:11.980 --> 39:13.980
 Well, he was, but well, he was named that later.

39:13.980 --> 39:18.980
 But the point is that I wanna know the psychology

39:18.980 --> 39:23.860
 of becoming a figure like him.

39:23.860 --> 39:25.660
 Well, I don't even know how to phrase the question right,

39:25.660 --> 39:27.980
 but it's a question about what do you do

39:27.980 --> 39:32.980
 when you're following, your fans become so large

39:35.780 --> 39:37.980
 that it's almost bigger than you.

39:37.980 --> 39:41.020
 And how do you responsibly manage that?

39:41.020 --> 39:42.180
 And maybe it doesn't worry him at all.

39:42.180 --> 39:43.500
 And that's fine too.

39:43.500 --> 39:45.500
 But I'd be really curious.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.660
 And I think there are a lot of people that go through this

39:47.660 --> 39:50.380
 when they realize, whoa, there are a lot of eyes on me.

39:50.380 --> 39:53.900
 There are a lot of people who really take what I say

39:53.900 --> 39:57.700
 very earnestly and take it to heart and will defend me.

39:57.700 --> 40:02.700
 And whew, that's, that's, that can be dangerous.

40:04.260 --> 40:07.500
 And you have to be responsible with it.

40:07.500 --> 40:09.260
 Both in terms of impact on society

40:09.260 --> 40:11.260
 and psychologically for the individual,

40:11.260 --> 40:15.020
 just the burden psychologically on Elon?

40:15.020 --> 40:18.820
 Yeah, yeah, how does he think about that?

40:18.820 --> 40:21.180
 Part of his persona.

40:21.180 --> 40:23.340
 Well, let me throw that right back at you

40:23.340 --> 40:27.500
 because in some ways you're just a funny guy

40:28.540 --> 40:31.660
 that gotten a humongous following,

40:31.660 --> 40:33.540
 a funny guy with a curiosity.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.540
 You've got a huge following.

40:36.540 --> 40:40.060
 How do you psychologically deal with the responsibility?

40:40.060 --> 40:41.980
 In many ways you have a reach

40:41.980 --> 40:44.540
 in many ways bigger than Elon Musk.

40:44.540 --> 40:49.340
 What is your, what is the burden that you feel in educating

40:49.340 --> 40:51.980
 being one of the biggest educators in the world

40:51.980 --> 40:53.500
 where everybody's listening to you

40:53.500 --> 40:58.380
 and actually everybody, like most of the world

40:58.380 --> 41:01.060
 that's uses YouTube for educational material,

41:01.060 --> 41:06.000
 trust you as a source of good, strong scientific thinking.

41:07.540 --> 41:11.020
 It's a burden and I try to approach it

41:11.020 --> 41:16.020
 with a lot of humility and sharing.

41:16.020 --> 41:18.580
 Like I'm not out there doing

41:18.580 --> 41:20.300
 a lot of scientific experiments.

41:20.300 --> 41:23.180
 I am sharing the work of real scientists

41:23.180 --> 41:26.420
 and I'm celebrating their work and the way that they think

41:26.420 --> 41:29.500
 and the power of curiosity.

41:29.500 --> 41:32.200
 But I wanna make it clear at all times that like,

41:32.200 --> 41:35.260
 look, we don't know all the answers

41:35.260 --> 41:37.660
 and I don't think we're ever going to reach a point

41:37.660 --> 41:39.500
 where we're like, wow, and there you go.

41:39.500 --> 41:40.620
 That's the universe.

41:40.620 --> 41:43.820
 It's this equation, you plug in some conditions or whatever

41:43.820 --> 41:44.660
 and you do the math

41:44.660 --> 41:46.100
 and you know what's gonna happen tomorrow.

41:46.100 --> 41:47.920
 I don't think we're ever gonna reach that point,

41:47.920 --> 41:51.920
 but I think that there is a tendency

41:51.920 --> 41:56.100
 to sometimes believe in science and become elitist

41:56.100 --> 41:58.860
 and become, I don't know, hard when in reality

41:58.860 --> 42:01.780
 it should humble you and make you feel smaller.

42:01.780 --> 42:03.080
 I think there's something very beautiful

42:03.080 --> 42:07.420
 about feeling very, very small and very weak

42:07.420 --> 42:10.940
 and to feel that you need other people.

42:10.940 --> 42:13.220
 So I try to keep that in mind and say,

42:13.220 --> 42:14.340
 look, thanks for watching.

42:14.340 --> 42:16.700
 Vsauce is not, I'm not Vsauce, you are.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.080
 When I start the episodes, I say,

42:18.080 --> 42:20.500
 hey, Vsauce, Michael here.

42:20.500 --> 42:22.260
 Vsauce and Michael are actually a different thing

42:22.260 --> 42:23.100
 in my mind.

42:23.100 --> 42:24.380
 I don't know if that's always clear,

42:24.380 --> 42:26.900
 but yeah, I have to approach it that way

42:26.900 --> 42:29.040
 because it's not about me.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.860
 Yeah, so it's not even,

42:31.860 --> 42:33.620
 you're not feeling the responsibility.

42:33.620 --> 42:36.100
 You're just sort of plugging into this big thing

42:36.100 --> 42:40.020
 that is scientific exploration of our reality

42:40.020 --> 42:42.660
 and you're a voice that represents a bunch,

42:42.660 --> 42:47.660
 but you're just plugging into this big Vsauce ball

42:47.660 --> 42:49.860
 that others, millions of others are plugged into.

42:49.860 --> 42:53.060
 Yeah, and I'm just hoping to encourage curiosity

42:53.060 --> 42:56.380
 and responsible thinking

42:56.380 --> 43:01.380
 and an embracement of doubt

43:01.980 --> 43:05.020
 and being okay with that.

43:05.020 --> 43:08.200
 So I'm next week talking to Christos Gudrow.

43:08.200 --> 43:09.980
 I'm not sure if you're familiar who he is,

43:09.980 --> 43:11.660
 but he's the VP of engineering,

43:11.660 --> 43:14.660
 head of the quote unquote YouTube algorithm

43:14.660 --> 43:16.140
 or the search and discovery.

43:16.140 --> 43:20.180
 So let me ask, first high level,

43:20.180 --> 43:25.100
 do you have a question for him

43:25.100 --> 43:28.860
 that if you can get an honest answer that you would ask,

43:28.860 --> 43:30.140
 but more generally,

43:30.140 --> 43:32.620
 how do you think about the YouTube algorithm

43:32.620 --> 43:36.060
 that drives some of the motivation behind,

43:36.060 --> 43:38.900
 no, some of the design decisions you make

43:38.900 --> 43:42.220
 as you ask and answer some of the questions you do,

43:42.220 --> 43:45.140
 how would you improve this algorithm in your mind in general?

43:45.140 --> 43:47.540
 So just what would you ask him?

43:47.540 --> 43:49.500
 And outside of that,

43:49.500 --> 43:52.700
 how would you like to see the algorithm improve?

43:52.700 --> 43:56.780
 Well, I think of the algorithm as a mirror.

43:56.780 --> 43:58.940
 It reflects what people put in

43:58.940 --> 44:01.140
 and we don't always like what we see in that mirror.

44:01.140 --> 44:02.780
 From the individual mirror

44:02.780 --> 44:05.420
 to the individual mirror to the society.

44:05.420 --> 44:07.020
 Both, in the aggregate,

44:07.020 --> 44:11.380
 it's reflecting back what people on average want to watch.

44:11.380 --> 44:15.340
 And when you see things being recommended to you,

44:15.340 --> 44:19.220
 it's reflecting back what it thinks you want to see.

44:19.220 --> 44:22.300
 And specifically, I would guess that it's

44:22.300 --> 44:23.560
 not just what you want to see,

44:23.560 --> 44:25.560
 but what you will click on

44:25.560 --> 44:30.560
 and what you will watch some of and stay on YouTube

44:30.560 --> 44:32.480
 because of.

44:32.480 --> 44:34.860
 I don't think that, this is all me guessing,

44:34.860 --> 44:38.980
 but I don't think that YouTube cares

44:38.980 --> 44:41.700
 if you only watch like a second of a video,

44:41.700 --> 44:45.100
 as long as the next thing you do is open another video.

44:45.100 --> 44:49.380
 If you close the app or close the site,

44:49.380 --> 44:50.780
 that's a problem for them

44:50.780 --> 44:52.940
 because they're not a subscription platform.

44:52.940 --> 44:53.780
 They're not like, look,

44:53.780 --> 44:56.120
 you're giving us 20 bucks a month no matter what,

44:56.120 --> 44:57.620
 so who cares?

44:57.620 --> 45:02.100
 They need you to watch and spend time there and see ads.

45:02.100 --> 45:03.620
 So one of the things I'm curious about

45:03.620 --> 45:08.620
 whether they do consider longer term sort of develop,

45:09.980 --> 45:12.600
 your longer term development as a human being,

45:12.600 --> 45:15.100
 which I think ultimately will make you feel better

45:15.100 --> 45:17.460
 about using YouTube in the longterm

45:17.460 --> 45:19.920
 and allowing you to stick with it for longer.

45:19.920 --> 45:23.300
 Because even if you feed the dopamine rush in the short term

45:23.300 --> 45:25.580
 and you keep clicking on cat videos,

45:25.580 --> 45:28.980
 eventually you sort of wake up like from a drug

45:28.980 --> 45:30.860
 and say, I need to quit this.

45:30.860 --> 45:32.700
 So I wonder how much you're trying to optimize

45:32.700 --> 45:35.820
 for the longterm because when I look at the,

45:35.820 --> 45:39.420
 your videos aren't exactly sort of, no offense,

45:39.420 --> 45:41.740
 but they're not the most clickable.

45:41.740 --> 45:44.180
 They're both the most clickable

45:44.180 --> 45:47.260
 and I feel I watched the entire thing

45:47.260 --> 45:49.640
 and I feel a better human after I watched it, right?

45:49.640 --> 45:54.640
 So like they're not just optimizing for the clickability

45:54.640 --> 45:59.640
 because I hope, so my thought is how do you think of it?

45:59.880 --> 46:02.240
 And does it affect your own content?

46:02.240 --> 46:03.280
 Like how deep you go,

46:03.280 --> 46:07.000
 how profound you explore the directions and so on.

46:07.000 --> 46:11.500
 I've been really lucky in that I don't worry too much

46:11.500 --> 46:12.520
 about the algorithm.

46:12.520 --> 46:13.800
 I mean, look at my thumbnails.

46:13.800 --> 46:17.200
 I don't really go too wild with them.

46:17.200 --> 46:19.800
 And with minefield where I'm in partnership with YouTube

46:19.800 --> 46:22.400
 on the thumbnails, I'm often like, let's pull this back.

46:22.400 --> 46:23.960
 Let's be mysterious.

46:23.960 --> 46:25.640
 But usually I'm just trying to do

46:25.640 --> 46:27.520
 what everyone else is not doing.

46:27.520 --> 46:30.960
 So if everyone's doing crazy Photoshop kind of thumbnails,

46:30.960 --> 46:34.120
 I'm like, what if the thumbnails just a line?

46:34.120 --> 46:37.760
 And what if the title is just a word?

46:37.760 --> 46:41.160
 And I kind of feel like all of the Vsauce channels

46:41.160 --> 46:43.160
 have cultivated an audience that expects that.

46:43.160 --> 46:45.340
 And so they would rather Jake make a video

46:45.340 --> 46:48.440
 that's just called stains than one called,

46:48.440 --> 46:50.920
 I explored stains, shocking.

46:50.920 --> 46:53.300
 But there are other audiences out there that want that.

46:53.300 --> 46:57.080
 And I think most people kind of want

46:57.080 --> 46:58.800
 what you see the algorithm favoring,

46:58.800 --> 47:02.240
 which is mainstream traditional celebrity

47:02.240 --> 47:03.640
 and news kind of information.

47:03.640 --> 47:05.200
 I mean, that's what makes YouTube really different

47:05.200 --> 47:06.680
 than other streaming platforms.

47:06.680 --> 47:08.800
 No one's like, what's going on in the world?

47:08.800 --> 47:10.520
 I'll open up Netflix to find out.

47:10.520 --> 47:12.720
 But you do open up Twitter to find that out.

47:12.720 --> 47:14.840
 You open up Facebook and you can open up YouTube

47:14.840 --> 47:16.260
 because you'll see that the trending videos

47:16.260 --> 47:20.240
 are like what happened amongst the traditional mainstream

47:20.240 --> 47:22.120
 people in different industries.

47:22.120 --> 47:24.040
 And that's what's being shown.

47:24.040 --> 47:27.560
 And it's not necessarily YouTube saying,

47:27.560 --> 47:29.240
 we want that to be what you see.

47:29.240 --> 47:31.400
 It's that that's what people click on.

47:31.400 --> 47:33.320
 When they see Ariana Grande, you know,

47:33.320 --> 47:36.280
 reads a love letter from like her high school sweetheart,

47:36.280 --> 47:38.000
 they're like, I wanna see that.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.320
 And when they see a video from me

47:39.320 --> 47:41.800
 that's got some lines in math and it's called law and causes

47:41.800 --> 47:45.940
 they're like, well, I mean, I'm just on the bus.

47:45.940 --> 47:48.640
 Like I don't have time to dive into a whole lesson.

47:48.640 --> 47:52.360
 So, you know, before you get super mad at YouTube,

47:52.360 --> 47:53.640
 you should say, really,

47:53.640 --> 47:55.520
 they're just reflecting back human behavior.

47:55.520 --> 47:59.040
 Is there something you would improve about the algorithm

48:00.240 --> 48:02.760
 knowing of course, that as far as we're concerned,

48:02.760 --> 48:04.600
 it's a black box, so we don't know how it works.

48:04.600 --> 48:06.760
 Right, and I don't think that even anyone at YouTube

48:06.760 --> 48:07.920
 really knows what it's doing.

48:07.920 --> 48:09.800
 They know what they've tweaked, but then it learns.

48:09.800 --> 48:13.800
 I think that it learns and it decides how to behave.

48:13.800 --> 48:16.640
 And sometimes the YouTube employees are left going,

48:16.640 --> 48:17.740
 I don't know.

48:17.740 --> 48:19.600
 Maybe we should like change the value

48:19.600 --> 48:22.640
 of how much it, you know, worries about watch time.

48:22.640 --> 48:24.800
 And maybe it should worry more about something else.

48:24.800 --> 48:25.640
 I don't know.

48:25.640 --> 48:27.400
 But I mean, I would like to see,

48:28.400 --> 48:30.680
 I don't know what they're doing and not doing.

48:30.680 --> 48:32.740
 Well, is there a conversation

48:32.740 --> 48:35.720
 that you think they should be having just internally,

48:35.720 --> 48:37.300
 whether they're having it or not?

48:37.300 --> 48:38.920
 Is there something,

48:38.920 --> 48:41.140
 should they be thinking about the longterm future?

48:41.140 --> 48:44.440
 Should they be thinking about educational content

48:44.440 --> 48:48.160
 and whether that's educating about what just happened

48:48.160 --> 48:50.680
 in the world today, news or educational content,

48:50.680 --> 48:51.520
 like what you're providing,

48:51.520 --> 48:54.360
 which is asking big sort of timeless questions

48:54.360 --> 48:56.580
 about how the way the world works.

48:56.580 --> 48:58.120
 Well, it's interesting.

48:58.120 --> 48:59.400
 What should they think about?

48:59.400 --> 49:02.620
 Because it's called YouTube, not our tube.

49:02.620 --> 49:04.680
 And that's why I think they have

49:04.680 --> 49:08.360
 so many phenomenal educational creators.

49:08.360 --> 49:11.720
 You don't have shows like Three Blue One Brown

49:11.720 --> 49:14.960
 or Physics Girl or Looking Glass Universe or Up and Atom

49:14.960 --> 49:18.720
 or Brain Scoop or, I mean, I could go on and on.

49:18.720 --> 49:21.200
 They aren't on Amazon Prime and Netflix

49:21.200 --> 49:24.000
 and they don't have commissioned shows from those platforms.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.520
 It's all organically happening

49:25.520 --> 49:26.660
 because there are people out there

49:26.660 --> 49:30.140
 that want to share their passion for learning,

49:30.140 --> 49:32.520
 that wanna share their curiosity.

49:32.520 --> 49:37.440
 And YouTube could promote those kinds of shows more,

49:37.440 --> 49:42.440
 but first of all, they probably wouldn't get as many clicks

49:43.240 --> 49:45.340
 and YouTube needs to make sure that the average user

49:45.340 --> 49:47.720
 is always clicking and staying on the site.

49:47.720 --> 49:51.060
 They could still promote it more for the good of society,

49:51.060 --> 49:52.720
 but then we're making some really weird claims

49:52.720 --> 49:53.960
 about what's good for society

49:53.960 --> 49:55.600
 because I think that cat videos

49:55.600 --> 49:58.040
 are also an incredibly important part

49:58.040 --> 50:00.360
 of what it means to be a human.

50:00.360 --> 50:02.860
 I mentioned this quote before from Unumuno about,

50:02.860 --> 50:05.400
 look, I've seen a cat like estimate distances

50:05.400 --> 50:09.440
 and calculate a jump more often than I've seen a cat cry.

50:09.440 --> 50:12.440
 And so things that play with our emotions

50:12.440 --> 50:15.360
 and make us feel things can be cheesy and can feel cheap,

50:15.360 --> 50:18.000
 but like, man, that's very human.

50:18.000 --> 50:23.000
 And so even the dumbest vlog is still so important

50:23.760 --> 50:27.380
 that I don't think I have a better claim to take its spot

50:27.380 --> 50:29.840
 than it has to have that spot.

50:29.840 --> 50:32.600
 It puts a mirror to us, the beautiful parts,

50:32.600 --> 50:35.880
 the ugly parts, the shallow parts, the deep parts.

50:35.880 --> 50:36.720
 You're right.

50:36.720 --> 50:38.520
 What I would like to see is,

50:39.840 --> 50:43.360
 I miss the days when engaging with content on YouTube

50:43.360 --> 50:47.620
 helped push it into my subscribers timelines.

50:47.620 --> 50:49.560
 It used to be that when I liked a video,

50:49.560 --> 50:54.560
 say from Veritasium, it would show up in the feed

50:54.620 --> 50:58.340
 on the front page of the app or the website of my subscribers.

50:58.340 --> 51:00.440
 And I knew that if I liked a video,

51:00.440 --> 51:03.480
 I could send it 100,000 views or more.

51:03.480 --> 51:05.360
 That no longer is true,

51:05.360 --> 51:07.300
 but I think that was a good user experience.

51:07.300 --> 51:09.800
 When I subscribe to someone, when I'm following them,

51:09.800 --> 51:13.060
 I want to see more of what they like.

51:13.060 --> 51:15.360
 I want them to also curate the feed for me.

51:15.360 --> 51:17.900
 And I think that Twitter and Facebook are doing that

51:17.900 --> 51:20.320
 in also some ways that are kind of annoying,

51:20.320 --> 51:22.340
 but I would like that to happen more.

51:22.340 --> 51:25.160
 And I think we would see communities being stronger

51:25.160 --> 51:27.300
 on YouTube if it was that way instead of YouTube going,

51:27.300 --> 51:29.760
 well, technically Michael liked this Veritasium video,

51:29.760 --> 51:33.620
 but people are way more likely to click on Carpool Karaoke.

51:33.620 --> 51:36.200
 So I don't even care who they are, just give them that.

51:36.200 --> 51:38.960
 Not saying anything against Carpool Karaoke,

51:38.960 --> 51:43.260
 that is a extremely important part of our society,

51:43.260 --> 51:46.780
 what it means to be a human on earth, you know, but.

51:46.780 --> 51:48.440
 I'll say it sucks, but.

51:48.440 --> 51:51.380
 Yeah, but a lot of people would disagree with you

51:51.380 --> 51:53.860
 and they should be able to see as much of that as they want.

51:53.860 --> 51:55.660
 And I think even people who don't think they like it

51:55.660 --> 51:57.100
 should still be really aware of it

51:57.100 --> 51:59.400
 because it's such an important thing.

51:59.400 --> 52:00.900
 It's such an influential thing.

52:00.900 --> 52:03.260
 But yeah, I just wish that like new channels I discover

52:03.260 --> 52:04.340
 and that I subscribe to,

52:04.340 --> 52:06.940
 I wish that my subscribers found out about that

52:06.940 --> 52:10.020
 because especially in the education community,

52:10.020 --> 52:11.580
 a rising tide floats all boats.

52:11.580 --> 52:14.020
 If you watch a video from Numberphile,

52:14.020 --> 52:16.740
 you're just more likely to want to watch an episode from me,

52:16.740 --> 52:18.540
 whether it be on Vsauce1 or Ding.

52:18.540 --> 52:21.840
 It's not competitive in the way that traditional TV was

52:21.840 --> 52:23.180
 where it's like, well, if you tune into that show,

52:23.180 --> 52:24.540
 it means you're not watching mine

52:24.540 --> 52:26.140
 because they both air at the same time.

52:26.140 --> 52:29.340
 So helping each other out through collaborations

52:29.340 --> 52:30.180
 takes a lot of work,

52:30.180 --> 52:32.820
 but just through engaging, commenting on their videos,

52:32.820 --> 52:36.700
 liking their videos, subscribing to them, whatever,

52:36.700 --> 52:41.500
 that I would love to see become easier and more powerful.

52:41.500 --> 52:46.060
 So a quick and impossibly deep question,

52:46.060 --> 52:48.980
 last question about mortality.

52:48.980 --> 52:52.580
 You've spoken about death as an interesting topic.

52:52.580 --> 52:55.940
 Do you think about your own mortality?

52:55.940 --> 52:59.740
 Yeah, every day, it's really scary.

52:59.740 --> 53:04.020
 So what do you think is the meaning of life

53:04.020 --> 53:07.340
 that mortality makes very explicit?

53:07.340 --> 53:12.340
 So why are you here on earth, Michael?

53:12.620 --> 53:14.560
 What's the point of this whole thing?

53:18.100 --> 53:23.100
 What does mortality in the context of the whole universe

53:23.100 --> 53:26.400
 make you realize about yourself?

53:26.400 --> 53:28.060
 Just you, Michael Stevens.

53:29.140 --> 53:31.300
 Well, it makes me realize

53:31.300 --> 53:35.620
 that I am destined to become a notion.

53:35.620 --> 53:39.620
 I'm destined to become a memory and we can extend life.

53:39.620 --> 53:42.900
 I think there's really exciting things being done

53:42.900 --> 53:43.860
 to extend life,

53:43.860 --> 53:47.100
 but we still don't know how to protect you

53:47.100 --> 53:48.860
 from some accident that could happen,

53:48.860 --> 53:50.300
 some unforeseen thing.

53:50.300 --> 53:54.140
 Maybe we could save my connectome

53:54.140 --> 53:56.580
 and recreate my consciousness digitally,

53:56.580 --> 53:59.420
 but even that could be lost

54:00.340 --> 54:02.580
 if it's stored on a physical medium or something.

54:02.580 --> 54:05.580
 So basically, I just think that embracing

54:07.780 --> 54:09.020
 and realizing how cool it is,

54:09.020 --> 54:11.540
 that someday I will just be an idea.

54:11.540 --> 54:13.380
 And there won't be a Michael anymore

54:13.380 --> 54:16.180
 that can be like, no, that's not what I meant.

54:16.180 --> 54:17.540
 It'll just be what people,

54:17.540 --> 54:19.620
 they have to guess what I meant.

54:19.620 --> 54:21.740
 And they'll remember me

54:23.140 --> 54:25.780
 and how I live on as that memory

54:25.780 --> 54:29.600
 will maybe not even be who I want it to be.

54:29.600 --> 54:31.940
 But there's something powerful about that.

54:31.940 --> 54:32.900
 And there's something powerful

54:32.900 --> 54:37.900
 about letting future people run the show themselves.

54:38.980 --> 54:41.980
 I think I'm glad to get out of their way at some point

54:41.980 --> 54:43.660
 and say, all right, it's your world now.

54:43.660 --> 54:47.300
 So you, the physical entity, Michael,

54:47.300 --> 54:50.260
 have ripple effects in the space of ideas

54:50.260 --> 54:54.260
 that far outlives you in ways that you can't control,

54:54.260 --> 54:56.100
 but it's nevertheless fascinating to think,

54:56.100 --> 54:57.580
 I mean, especially with you,

54:57.580 --> 54:59.180
 you can imagine an alien species

54:59.180 --> 55:01.740
 when they finally arrive and destroy all of us

55:01.740 --> 55:04.580
 would watch your videos to try to figure out

55:04.580 --> 55:05.980
 what were the questions that these people.

55:05.980 --> 55:07.460
 But even if they didn't,

55:08.620 --> 55:11.380
 I still think that there will be ripples.

55:11.380 --> 55:13.420
 Like when I say memory,

55:13.420 --> 55:16.580
 I don't specifically mean people remember my name

55:16.580 --> 55:18.940
 and my birth date and like there's a photo of me

55:18.940 --> 55:20.860
 on Wikipedia, like all that can be lost,

55:20.860 --> 55:23.980
 but I still would hope that people ask questions

55:23.980 --> 55:26.460
 and teach concepts in some of the ways

55:26.460 --> 55:28.340
 that I have found useful and satisfying.

55:28.340 --> 55:29.780
 Even if they don't know that I was the one

55:29.780 --> 55:32.580
 who tried to popularize it, that's fine.

55:32.580 --> 55:35.260
 But if Earth was completely destroyed,

55:35.260 --> 55:39.340
 like burnt to a crisp, everything on it today,

55:39.340 --> 55:42.700
 what would, the universe wouldn't care.

55:42.700 --> 55:47.700
 Like Jupiter's not gonna go, oh no, and that could happen.

55:49.980 --> 55:54.980
 So we do however have the power to launch things

55:55.100 --> 56:00.100
 into space to try to extend how long our memory exists.

56:02.900 --> 56:04.620
 And what I mean by that is,

56:04.620 --> 56:06.900
 we are recording things about the world

56:06.900 --> 56:08.420
 and we're learning things and writing stories

56:08.420 --> 56:13.020
 and all of this and preserving that is truly

56:13.020 --> 56:16.580
 what I think is the essence of being a human.

56:16.580 --> 56:20.580
 We are autobiographers of the universe

56:20.580 --> 56:21.660
 and we're really good at it.

56:21.660 --> 56:22.940
 We're better than fossils.

56:22.940 --> 56:25.500
 We're better than light spectrum.

56:25.500 --> 56:26.740
 We're better than any of that.

56:26.740 --> 56:29.980
 We collect much more detailed memories

56:29.980 --> 56:32.820
 of what's happening, much better data.

56:32.820 --> 56:37.300
 And so that should be our legacy.

56:37.300 --> 56:40.140
 And I hope that that's kind of mine too

56:40.140 --> 56:42.420
 in terms of people remembering something

56:42.420 --> 56:44.780
 or having some kind of effect.

56:44.780 --> 56:47.860
 But even if I don't, you can't not have an effect.

56:47.860 --> 56:49.180
 This is not me feeling like,

56:49.180 --> 56:50.820
 I hope that I have this powerful legacy.

56:50.820 --> 56:53.820
 It's like, no matter who you are, you will.

56:53.820 --> 56:57.700
 But you also have to embrace the fact

56:57.700 --> 57:01.340
 that that impact might look really small and that's okay.

57:01.340 --> 57:04.460
 One of my favorite quotes is from Tessa the Durbervilles.

57:04.460 --> 57:08.220
 And it's along the lines of the measure of your life

57:08.220 --> 57:10.940
 depends on not your external displacement

57:10.940 --> 57:13.100
 but your subjective experience.

57:13.100 --> 57:15.780
 If I am happy and those that I love are happy,

57:16.700 --> 57:17.700
 can that be enough?

57:17.700 --> 57:20.100
 Because if so, excellent.

57:21.340 --> 57:23.460
 I think there's no better place to end it, Michael.

57:23.460 --> 57:24.300
 Thank you so much.

 And now, let me leave you with some words of wisdom

57:58.580 --> 58:00.780
 from Albert Einstein.

58:00.780 --> 58:03.980
 The important thing is not to stop questioning.

58:03.980 --> 58:06.900
 Curiosity has its own reason for existence.

58:06.900 --> 58:09.220
 One cannot help but be in awe

58:09.220 --> 58:11.740
 when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity,

58:11.740 --> 58:14.980
 of life, the marvelous structure of reality.

58:14.980 --> 58:18.100
 It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend

58:18.100 --> 58:20.140
 a little of this mystery every day.

58:20.140 --> 58:32.820
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
