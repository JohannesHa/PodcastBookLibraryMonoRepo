00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
 The following is a conversation with Kevin Systrom,

00:02.960 --> 00:06.480
 cofounder and long time CEO of Instagram,

00:06.480 --> 00:09.120
 including for six years after Facebook's acquisition

00:09.120 --> 00:10.560
 of Instagram.

00:10.560 --> 00:13.040
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:13.040 --> 00:15.280
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:15.280 --> 00:16.600
 in the description.

00:16.600 --> 00:20.960
 And now, here's my conversation with Kevin Systrom.

00:21.920 --> 00:24.520
 At the risk of asking the Rolling Stones

00:24.520 --> 00:26.360
 to play Satisfaction, let me ask you about

00:26.360 --> 00:28.120
 the origin story of Instagram.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.480
 Sure. So maybe some context.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.800
 You, like we were talking about offline,

00:32.800 --> 00:36.560
 grew up in Massachusetts, learned computer programming there,

00:36.560 --> 00:40.880
 liked to play Doom II, worked at a vinyl record store.

00:40.880 --> 00:45.880
 Then you went to Stanford, turned down Mr. Mark Zuckerberg

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
 and Facebook, went to Florence to study photography.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.680
 Those are just some random, beautiful,

00:51.680 --> 00:54.780
 impossibly brief glimpses into a life.

00:54.780 --> 00:56.800
 So let me ask again, can you take me through

00:56.800 --> 00:59.280
 the origin story of Instagram, given that context?

00:59.280 --> 01:00.480
 You basically set it up.

01:01.920 --> 01:04.640
 All right, so we have a fair amount of time,

01:04.640 --> 01:05.920
 so I'll go into some detail.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.480
 But basically what I'll say is,

01:09.080 --> 01:13.540
 Instagram started out of a company actually called Bourbon,

01:13.540 --> 01:16.200
 and it was spelled B U R B N.

01:16.200 --> 01:19.080
 And a couple of things were happening at the time.

01:19.080 --> 01:22.560
 So if we zoom back to 2010, not a lot of people remember

01:22.560 --> 01:25.560
 what was happening in the dot com world then,

01:25.560 --> 01:29.440
 but check in apps were all the rage.

01:29.440 --> 01:30.280
 So.

01:30.280 --> 01:31.120
 What's a check in app?

01:31.120 --> 01:34.320
 Gowalla, Foursquare, Hotpotato.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.760
 So I'm at a place, I'm gonna tell the world

01:36.760 --> 01:37.720
 that I'm at this place.

01:37.720 --> 01:38.680
 That's right.

01:38.680 --> 01:41.240
 What's the idea behind this kind of app, by the way?

01:41.240 --> 01:42.760
 You know what, I'm gonna answer that,

01:42.760 --> 01:45.320
 but through what Instagram became

01:45.320 --> 01:48.040
 and why I believe Instagram replaced them.

01:48.040 --> 01:49.800
 So the whole idea was to share with the world

01:49.800 --> 01:52.800
 what you were doing, specifically with your friends, right?

01:53.880 --> 01:54.800
 But there were all the rage,

01:54.800 --> 01:56.360
 and Foursquare was getting all the press.

01:56.360 --> 01:57.800
 And I remember sitting around saying,

01:57.800 --> 01:58.920
 hey, I wanna build something,

01:58.920 --> 02:00.580
 but I don't know what I wanna build.

02:00.580 --> 02:04.320
 What if I built a better version of Foursquare?

02:04.320 --> 02:07.920
 And I asked myself, well, why don't I like Foursquare

02:07.920 --> 02:09.320
 or how could it be improved?

02:10.760 --> 02:13.040
 And basically I sat down and I said,

02:13.040 --> 02:16.560
 I think that if you have a few extra features,

02:16.560 --> 02:17.480
 it might be enough.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.080
 One of which happened to be posting a photo

02:19.080 --> 02:20.320
 of where you were.

02:20.320 --> 02:21.520
 There were some others.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.120
 It turns out that wasn't enough.

02:23.120 --> 02:27.000
 My co founder joined, we were going to attack Foursquare

02:27.000 --> 02:30.400
 and the likes and try to build something interesting.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.240
 And no one used it.

02:31.240 --> 02:32.600
 No one cared because it wasn't enough.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.720
 It wasn't different enough, right?

02:35.720 --> 02:38.040
 So one day we were sitting down and we asked ourselves,

02:38.040 --> 02:40.880
 okay, it's come to Jesus moment.

02:40.880 --> 02:43.120
 Are we gonna do this startup?

02:43.120 --> 02:44.400
 And if we're going to,

02:44.400 --> 02:46.160
 we can't do what we're currently doing.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.020
 We have to switch it up.

02:47.020 --> 02:48.360
 So what do people love the most?

02:48.360 --> 02:51.760
 So we sat down and we wrote out three things

02:51.760 --> 02:54.640
 that we thought people uniquely loved about our product

02:54.640 --> 02:57.160
 that weren't in other products.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.200
 Photos happened to be the top one.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.380
 So sharing a photo of what you were doing,

03:01.380 --> 03:03.160
 where you were at the moment

03:03.160 --> 03:06.640
 was not something products let you do really.

03:06.640 --> 03:09.480
 Facebook was like, post an album of your vacation

03:09.480 --> 03:11.440
 from two weeks ago, right?

03:11.440 --> 03:13.400
 Twitter allowed you to post a photo,

03:13.400 --> 03:15.560
 but their feed was primarily text

03:15.560 --> 03:17.400
 and they didn't show the photo in line

03:17.400 --> 03:19.720
 or at least I don't think they did at the time.

03:19.720 --> 03:23.520
 So even though it seems totally stupid

03:23.520 --> 03:27.280
 and obvious to us now, at the moment then,

03:27.280 --> 03:29.360
 posting a photo of what you were doing at the moment

03:29.360 --> 03:30.600
 was like not a thing.

03:32.020 --> 03:34.160
 So we decided to go after that

03:34.160 --> 03:36.480
 because we noticed that people who used our service,

03:36.480 --> 03:38.640
 the one thing they happened to like the most

03:38.640 --> 03:40.240
 was posting a photo.

03:40.240 --> 03:41.760
 So that was the beginning of Instagram.

03:41.760 --> 03:44.460
 And yes, like we went through and we added filters

03:44.460 --> 03:46.460
 and there's a bunch of stories around that.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.160
 But the origin of this was that

03:48.160 --> 03:49.580
 we were trying to be a check in app,

03:49.580 --> 03:52.360
 realized that no one wanted another check in app.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.000
 It became a photo sharing app,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.320
 but one that was much more about what you're doing

03:56.320 --> 03:57.480
 and where you are.

03:57.480 --> 03:58.600
 And that's why when I say,

03:58.600 --> 04:01.000
 I think we've replaced check in apps,

04:01.000 --> 04:03.680
 it became a check in via a photo

04:03.680 --> 04:06.580
 rather than saying your location

04:06.580 --> 04:08.760
 and then optionally adding a photo.

04:08.760 --> 04:11.420
 When you were thinking about what people like,

04:11.420 --> 04:13.240
 from where did you get a sense

04:13.240 --> 04:14.520
 that this is what people like?

04:14.520 --> 04:18.920
 You said, we sat down, we wrote some stuff down on paper.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.920
 Where is that intuition that seems fundamental

04:21.920 --> 04:26.820
 to the success of an app like Instagram?

04:26.820 --> 04:27.880
 Where does that idea,

04:27.880 --> 04:31.500
 where does that list of three things come from exactly?

04:31.500 --> 04:33.640
 Only after having studied machine learning now

04:33.640 --> 04:36.880
 for a couple of years, I like, I have a...

04:36.880 --> 04:38.440
 You have understood yourself?

04:39.400 --> 04:40.800
 I've started to make connections,

04:40.800 --> 04:43.360
 like we can go into this later,

04:43.360 --> 04:48.360
 but obviously the connections between machine learning

04:50.960 --> 04:53.800
 and the human brain, I think are stretched sometimes.

04:53.800 --> 04:57.400
 At the same time, being able to back prop

04:57.400 --> 05:01.000
 and being able to look at the world, try something,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.240
 figure out how you're wrong, how wrong you are,

05:04.240 --> 05:08.040
 and then nudge your company in the right direction

05:08.040 --> 05:10.100
 based on how wrong you are,

05:10.100 --> 05:12.280
 is a fascinating concept.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.720
 And I don't, we didn't know we were doing it at the time,

05:14.720 --> 05:17.120
 but that's basically what we were doing, right?

05:17.120 --> 05:19.440
 We put it out to, call it a hundred people,

05:20.480 --> 05:22.780
 and you would look at their data.

05:22.780 --> 05:25.200
 You would say, what are they sharing?

05:25.200 --> 05:26.960
 Like what resonates, what doesn't resonate?

05:26.960 --> 05:29.040
 We think they're gonna resonate with X,

05:29.040 --> 05:31.100
 but it turns out they resonate with Y.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.660
 Okay, shift the company towards Y.

05:33.660 --> 05:36.320
 And it turns out if you do that enough quickly enough,

05:36.320 --> 05:39.800
 you can get to a solution that has product market fit.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.640
 Most companies fail because they sit there

05:42.640 --> 05:45.520
 and they don't, either they're learning rates too slow,

05:45.520 --> 05:46.640
 they sit there and they're just,

05:46.640 --> 05:47.980
 they're adamant that they're right,

05:47.980 --> 05:50.720
 even though the data is telling them they're not right,

05:50.720 --> 05:53.240
 or they're learning rates too high

05:53.240 --> 05:55.220
 and they wildly chase different ideas

05:55.220 --> 05:57.120
 and they never actually settle on one

05:57.120 --> 05:59.520
 where they don't groove, right?

05:59.520 --> 06:00.600
 And I think when we sat down

06:00.600 --> 06:01.960
 and we wrote out those three ideas,

06:01.960 --> 06:05.720
 what we were saying is, what are the three possible,

06:05.720 --> 06:10.440
 whether they're local or global maxima in our world, right?

06:10.440 --> 06:12.800
 That users are telling us they like

06:12.800 --> 06:14.960
 because they're using the product that way.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.480
 It was clear people liked the photos

06:16.480 --> 06:18.680
 because that was the thing they were doing.

06:18.680 --> 06:20.320
 And we just said, okay, like,

06:20.320 --> 06:22.540
 what if we just cut out most of the other stuff

06:22.540 --> 06:24.100
 and focus on that thing?

06:25.440 --> 06:27.480
 And then it happened to be a multi billion dollar business

06:27.480 --> 06:30.240
 and it's that easy by the way.

06:30.240 --> 06:32.320
 Yeah, I guess so.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.320
 Well, nobody ever writes about neural networks

06:34.320 --> 06:36.160
 that miserably failed.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.480
 So this particular neural network succeeded.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.240
 Oh, they sell all the time, right?

06:40.240 --> 06:41.080
 Yeah.

06:41.080 --> 06:41.900
 But nobody writes about it.

06:41.900 --> 06:42.920
 The default state is failing.

06:42.920 --> 06:43.760
 Yes.

06:44.660 --> 06:47.320
 When you said the way people are using the app,

06:48.320 --> 06:51.160
 is that the loss function for this neural network

06:51.160 --> 06:52.960
 or is it also self report?

06:52.960 --> 06:54.880
 Like, do you ever ask people what they like

06:54.880 --> 06:58.540
 or do you have to track exactly what they're doing,

06:58.540 --> 07:00.020
 not what they're saying?

07:00.020 --> 07:03.120
 I once made a Thanksgiving dinner, okay?

07:03.120 --> 07:08.080
 And it was for relatives and I like to cook a lot.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.080
 Okay.

07:09.080 --> 07:13.680
 And I worked really hard on picking the specific dishes

07:13.680 --> 07:17.060
 and I was really proud because I had planned it out

07:17.060 --> 07:19.880
 using a Gantt chart and like it was ready on time

07:19.880 --> 07:21.240
 and everything was hot.

07:21.240 --> 07:22.080
 Nice.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.280
 Like, I don't know if you're a big Thanksgiving guy,

07:23.280 --> 07:25.640
 but like the worst thing about Thanksgiving

07:25.640 --> 07:28.120
 is when the turkey is cold and some things are hot

07:28.120 --> 07:29.220
 and some things, anyway.

07:29.220 --> 07:30.060
 You had a Gantt chart.

07:30.060 --> 07:31.340
 Did you actually have a chart?

07:31.340 --> 07:32.180
 Oh yeah.

07:32.180 --> 07:36.040
 OmniPlan, fairly expensive, like Gantt chart thing

07:36.040 --> 07:39.380
 that I think maybe 10 people have purchased in the world,

07:39.380 --> 07:42.260
 but I'm one of them and I use it for recipe planning

07:42.260 --> 07:44.380
 only around big holidays.

07:44.380 --> 07:45.920
 That's brilliant, by the way.

07:45.920 --> 07:47.840
 Do people do this kind of...

07:47.840 --> 07:48.920
 Overengineering?

07:48.920 --> 07:50.820
 It's not overengineering, it's just engineering.

07:50.820 --> 07:51.660
 It's planning.

07:51.660 --> 07:54.720
 Thanksgiving is a complicated set of events

07:54.720 --> 07:57.420
 with some uncertainty with a lot of things going on.

07:57.420 --> 07:59.760
 You should be able, you should be planning it in this way.

07:59.760 --> 08:00.840
 There should be a chart.

08:00.840 --> 08:01.660
 It's not overengineering.

08:01.660 --> 08:04.860
 I mean, so what's funny is, brief aside.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.420
 Yes, it's brilliant.

08:06.420 --> 08:08.660
 I love cooking, I love food, I love coffee,

08:08.660 --> 08:10.340
 and I've spent some time with some chefs

08:10.340 --> 08:12.180
 who like know their stuff.

08:12.180 --> 08:15.500
 And they always just take out a piece of paper

08:15.500 --> 08:17.900
 and just work backwards in rough order.

08:17.900 --> 08:20.540
 Like it's never perfect, but rough order.

08:20.540 --> 08:21.900
 It's just like, oh, that makes sense.

08:21.900 --> 08:24.740
 Why not just work backwards from the end goal, right?

08:24.740 --> 08:26.060
 And put in some buffer time.

08:26.060 --> 08:29.860
 And so I probably over specified it a bit using a Gantt chart,

08:29.860 --> 08:32.720
 but the fact that you can do it,

08:32.720 --> 08:35.220
 it's what professional kitchens roughly do.

08:35.220 --> 08:36.880
 They just don't call it a Gantt chart,

08:36.880 --> 08:38.700
 or at least I don't think they do.

08:38.700 --> 08:40.280
 Anyway, I was telling a story about Thanksgiving.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.940
 So here's the thing.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.700
 I'm sitting down, we have the meal,

08:44.700 --> 08:49.220
 and then I got to know Ray Dalio fairly well

08:49.220 --> 08:51.660
 over maybe the last year of Instagram.

08:53.060 --> 08:55.100
 And one thing that he kept saying was like,

08:55.100 --> 08:59.900
 feedback is really hard to get honestly from people.

08:59.900 --> 09:02.420
 And I sat down after dinner, I said,

09:02.420 --> 09:03.680
 guys, I want feedback.

09:03.680 --> 09:05.640
 What was good and what was bad?

09:05.640 --> 09:06.480
 Yes.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.820
 And what's funny is like,

09:07.820 --> 09:11.140
 literally everyone just said everything was great.

09:11.140 --> 09:13.380
 And I like personally knew I had screwed up

09:13.380 --> 09:17.580
 a handful of things, but no one would say it.

09:17.580 --> 09:20.740
 And can you imagine now not something as high stakes

09:20.740 --> 09:22.020
 as Thanksgiving dinner, okay?

09:22.020 --> 09:25.100
 Thanksgiving dinner, it's not that high stakes.

09:25.100 --> 09:26.380
 But you're trying to build a product

09:26.380 --> 09:28.380
 and everyone knows you left your job for it

09:28.380 --> 09:29.540
 and you're trying to build it out

09:29.540 --> 09:32.000
 and you're trying to make something wonderful

09:32.000 --> 09:33.440
 and it's yours, right?

09:33.440 --> 09:34.560
 You designed it.

09:35.580 --> 09:37.900
 Now try asking for feedback

09:37.900 --> 09:39.980
 and know that you're giving this to your friends

09:39.980 --> 09:41.100
 and your family.

09:42.180 --> 09:45.580
 People have trouble giving hard feedback.

09:45.580 --> 09:48.860
 People have trouble saying, I don't like this

09:48.860 --> 09:51.980
 or this isn't great, or this is how it's failed me.

09:51.980 --> 09:56.600
 In fact, you usually have two classes of people.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.780
 People who just won't say bad things,

09:58.780 --> 10:00.440
 you can literally say to them,

10:00.440 --> 10:02.380
 please tell me what you hate most about this

10:02.380 --> 10:03.220
 and they won't do it.

10:03.220 --> 10:04.420
 They'll try, but they won't.

10:05.580 --> 10:06.900
 And then the other class of people

10:06.900 --> 10:09.700
 are just negative period about everything

10:09.700 --> 10:13.920
 and it's hard to parse out like what is true and what isn't.

10:14.840 --> 10:17.700
 So my rule of thumb with this is

10:17.700 --> 10:20.100
 you should always ask people,

10:20.100 --> 10:22.300
 but at the end of the day, it's amazing what data

10:22.300 --> 10:23.440
 will tell you.

10:23.440 --> 10:27.280
 And that's why with whatever project I work on, even now,

10:27.280 --> 10:30.220
 collecting data from the beginning on usage patterns,

10:30.220 --> 10:34.340
 so engagement, how many days of the week do they use it?

10:34.340 --> 10:36.660
 How many, I don't know if we were to go back to Instagram,

10:36.660 --> 10:39.460
 how many impressions per day, right?

10:39.460 --> 10:40.280
 Is that growing?

10:40.280 --> 10:41.120
 Is that shrinking?

10:41.120 --> 10:44.740
 And don't be like overly scientific about it, right?

10:44.740 --> 10:48.300
 Cause maybe you have 50 beta users or something.

10:48.300 --> 10:52.740
 But what's fascinating is that data doesn't lie.

10:52.740 --> 10:57.580
 People are very defensive about their time.

10:57.580 --> 10:59.260
 They'll say, oh, I'm so busy,

10:59.260 --> 11:00.740
 I'm sorry I didn't get to use the app.

11:00.740 --> 11:03.300
 Like I'm just, you know,

11:03.300 --> 11:05.220
 but I don't know you were posting on Instagram

11:05.220 --> 11:06.040
 the whole time.

11:07.140 --> 11:09.260
 So I don't know at the end of the day,

11:09.260 --> 11:11.500
 like at Facebook there was, you know,

11:11.500 --> 11:15.820
 before time spent became kind of this loaded term there.

11:15.820 --> 11:20.820
 The idea that people's currency in their lives is time.

11:21.060 --> 11:23.380
 And they only have a certain amount of time to give things,

11:23.380 --> 11:26.260
 whether it's friends or family or apps or TV shows

11:26.260 --> 11:28.940
 or whatever, there's no way of inventing more of it,

11:28.940 --> 11:30.340
 at least not that I know of.

11:32.700 --> 11:35.540
 If they don't use it, it's because it's not great.

11:35.540 --> 11:39.720
 So the moral of the story is you can ask all you want,

11:39.720 --> 11:41.860
 but you just have to look at the data.

11:41.860 --> 11:45.340
 And data doesn't lie, right?

11:45.340 --> 11:50.340
 I mean, there's metrics, there's data can obscure

11:51.140 --> 11:54.020
 the key insight if you're not careful.

11:54.020 --> 11:57.940
 So time spent in the app, that's one.

11:57.940 --> 11:59.820
 There's so many metrics you can put at this

11:59.820 --> 12:02.500
 and they will give you totally different insights,

12:02.500 --> 12:04.600
 especially when you're trying to create something

12:04.600 --> 12:07.660
 that doesn't obviously exist yet.

12:07.660 --> 12:12.660
 So, you know, measuring maybe why you left the app

12:12.660 --> 12:17.660
 or measuring special moments of happiness

12:17.780 --> 12:20.020
 that will make sure you return to the app

12:20.020 --> 12:22.380
 or moments of happiness that are long lasting

12:22.380 --> 12:26.440
 versus like dopamine short term, all of those things.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.680
 But I think I suppose in the beginning,

12:29.660 --> 12:33.180
 you can just get away with just asking the question,

12:33.180 --> 12:35.380
 which features are used a lot?

12:35.380 --> 12:37.260
 Let's do more of that.

12:37.260 --> 12:40.720
 And how hard was the decision?

12:40.720 --> 12:43.180
 And I mean, maybe you can tell me what Instagram

12:43.180 --> 12:44.460
 looked in the beginning,

12:44.460 --> 12:47.060
 but how hard was it to make pictures

12:47.060 --> 12:48.500
 of the first class citizen?

12:48.500 --> 12:50.460
 That's a revolutionary idea.

12:50.460 --> 12:55.460
 Like at whatever point Instagram became this feed of photos,

12:56.820 --> 12:58.460
 that's quite brilliant.

12:58.460 --> 13:02.020
 Plus, I also don't know when this happened,

13:02.020 --> 13:04.340
 but they're all shaped the same.

13:05.660 --> 13:06.500
 It's like a...

13:06.500 --> 13:09.100
 I have to tell you why, that's the interesting part.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.980
 Why is that?

13:10.980 --> 13:11.900
 So a couple of things.

13:11.900 --> 13:16.820
 One is data, like you're right.

13:16.820 --> 13:18.020
 You can overinterpret data.

13:18.020 --> 13:22.780
 Like imagine trying to fly a plane by staring at,

13:22.780 --> 13:25.700
 I don't know, a single metric like airspeed.

13:25.700 --> 13:27.060
 You don't know if you're going up or down.

13:27.060 --> 13:28.580
 I mean, it correlates with up or down,

13:28.580 --> 13:29.980
 but you don't actually know.

13:29.980 --> 13:32.240
 It will never help you land the plane.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.940
 So don't stare at one metric.

13:33.940 --> 13:36.840
 Like it turns out you have to synthesize a bunch of metrics

13:36.840 --> 13:37.900
 to know where to go.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.140
 But it doesn't lie.

13:40.140 --> 13:41.380
 Like if your airspeed is zero,

13:41.380 --> 13:43.100
 unless it's not working, right?

13:43.100 --> 13:46.380
 If it's zero, you're probably gonna fall out of the sky.

13:46.380 --> 13:50.540
 So generally you look around and you have the scan going.

13:50.540 --> 13:51.660
 Yes.

13:51.660 --> 13:52.900
 And you're just asking yourself,

13:52.900 --> 13:54.900
 is this working or is this not working?

13:56.340 --> 14:01.340
 But people have trouble explaining how they actually feel.

14:02.700 --> 14:05.100
 So just, it's about synthesizing both of them.

14:05.100 --> 14:07.780
 So then Instagram, right?

14:07.780 --> 14:10.460
 We were talking about revolutionary moment

14:10.460 --> 14:14.180
 where the feed became square photos basically.

14:14.180 --> 14:16.340
 And photos first and then square photos.

14:16.340 --> 14:17.180
 Yeah.

14:19.020 --> 14:21.500
 It was clear to me that the biggest,

14:21.500 --> 14:26.500
 so I believe the biggest companies are founded

14:26.900 --> 14:30.780
 when enormous technical shifts happen.

14:30.780 --> 14:32.860
 And the biggest technical shift that happened

14:32.860 --> 14:34.860
 right before Instagram was founded

14:34.860 --> 14:38.020
 was the advent of a phone that didn't suck.

14:38.020 --> 14:38.980
 The iPhone, right?

14:38.980 --> 14:40.740
 Like in retrospect, we're like, oh my God,

14:40.740 --> 14:43.180
 the first iPhone that almost had,

14:43.180 --> 14:44.540
 like it wasn't that good.

14:44.540 --> 14:46.800
 But compared to everything else at the time,

14:46.800 --> 14:48.940
 it was amazing.

14:48.940 --> 14:50.140
 And by the way,

14:50.140 --> 14:54.760
 the first phone that had an incredible camera

14:54.760 --> 14:57.740
 that could like do as well as the point and shoot

14:57.740 --> 15:01.100
 you might carry around was the iPhone 4.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.940
 And that was right when Instagram launched.

15:02.940 --> 15:04.660
 And we looked around and we said,

15:04.660 --> 15:05.940
 what will change?

15:05.940 --> 15:08.540
 Because everyone has a camera in their pocket.

15:08.540 --> 15:11.800
 And it was so clear to me that the world

15:11.800 --> 15:16.800
 of social networks before it was based in the desktop

15:16.860 --> 15:20.780
 and sitting there and having a link you could share, right?

15:20.780 --> 15:21.780
 And that wasn't gonna be the case.

15:21.780 --> 15:23.420
 So the question is what would you share

15:23.420 --> 15:25.400
 if you were out and about in the world?

15:26.900 --> 15:29.600
 If not only did you have a camera that fit in your pocket,

15:29.600 --> 15:31.980
 but by the way, that camera had a network attached to it

15:31.980 --> 15:34.780
 that allowed you to share instantly.

15:34.780 --> 15:36.100
 That seemed revolutionary.

15:36.100 --> 15:37.700
 And a bunch of people saw it at the same time.

15:37.700 --> 15:38.760
 It wasn't just Instagram.

15:38.760 --> 15:40.460
 There were a bunch of competitors.

15:41.340 --> 15:44.100
 The thing we did, I think was not only,

15:44.100 --> 15:45.320
 well, we focused on two things.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.700
 So we wrote down those things, we circled photos

15:47.700 --> 15:50.100
 and we said, I think we should invest in this.

15:50.100 --> 15:52.760
 But then we said, what sucks about photos?

15:52.760 --> 15:55.500
 One, they look like crap, right?

15:55.500 --> 15:57.060
 They just, at least back then.

15:57.060 --> 16:01.340
 Now my phone takes pretty great photos, right?

16:01.340 --> 16:05.260
 Back then they were blurry, not so great, compressed, right?

16:06.140 --> 16:11.140
 Two, it was really slow, like really slow to upload a photo.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.700
 And I'll tell a fun story about that

16:13.700 --> 16:15.900
 and explain to you why they're all the same size

16:15.900 --> 16:16.980
 and square as well.

16:18.220 --> 16:21.780
 And three, man, if you wanted to share a photo

16:21.780 --> 16:24.020
 on different networks, you had to go to each

16:24.020 --> 16:26.620
 of the individual apps and select all of them

16:26.620 --> 16:27.780
 and upload individually.

16:27.780 --> 16:30.580
 And so we were like, all right, those are the pain points.

16:30.580 --> 16:31.940
 We're gonna focus on that.

16:31.940 --> 16:36.020
 So one, instead of, because they weren't beautiful,

16:36.020 --> 16:37.540
 we were like, why don't we lean into the fact

16:37.540 --> 16:38.380
 that they're not beautiful?

16:38.380 --> 16:40.620
 And I remember studying in Florence,

16:40.620 --> 16:42.980
 my photography teacher gave me this Holga camera

16:42.980 --> 16:44.940
 and I'm not sure everyone knows what a Holga camera is,

16:44.940 --> 16:47.180
 but they're these old school plastic cameras.

16:48.180 --> 16:50.760
 I think they're produced in China at the time.

16:52.100 --> 16:54.240
 And I wanna say the original ones were like

16:54.240 --> 16:55.980
 from the 70s or the 80s or something.

16:55.980 --> 16:58.940
 They're supposed to be like $3 cameras for the every person.

16:58.940 --> 17:03.940
 They took nice medium format films, large negatives,

17:05.200 --> 17:07.880
 but they kind of blurred the light

17:07.880 --> 17:10.240
 and they kind of like light leaked into the side.

17:10.240 --> 17:13.200
 And there was this whole resurgence where people looked

17:13.200 --> 17:16.900
 at that and said, oh my God, this is a style, right?

17:16.900 --> 17:19.020
 And I remember using that in Florence and just saying,

17:19.020 --> 17:20.840
 well, why don't we just like lean into the fact

17:20.840 --> 17:24.320
 that these photos suck and make them suck more,

17:24.320 --> 17:26.220
 but in an artistic way.

17:26.220 --> 17:28.040
 And it turns out that had product market fit.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.200
 People really liked that.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.720
 They were willing to share their not so great photos

17:31.720 --> 17:35.820
 if they looked not so great on purpose, okay?

17:35.820 --> 17:37.400
 The second part.

17:37.400 --> 17:40.320
 That's where the filters come into picture.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.560
 So computational modification of photos

17:42.560 --> 17:46.200
 to make them look extra crappy to where it becomes art.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.040
 Yeah, yeah.

17:47.040 --> 17:51.720
 And I mean, add light leaks, add like an overlay filter,

17:51.720 --> 17:54.120
 make them more contrasty than they should be.

17:54.120 --> 17:58.080
 The first filter we ever produced was called X Pro 2.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.600
 And I designed it while I was

17:59.600 --> 18:02.160
 in this small little bed and breakfast room

18:02.160 --> 18:03.640
 in Todos Santos, Mexico.

18:03.640 --> 18:06.800
 I was trying to take a break from the bourbon days.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.840
 And I remember saying to my co founder,

18:08.840 --> 18:11.080
 I just need like a week to reset.

18:11.080 --> 18:15.080
 And that was on that trip worked on the first filter

18:15.080 --> 18:17.240
 because I said, you know, I think I can do this.

18:17.240 --> 18:22.080
 And I literally iterated one by one over the RGB values

18:22.080 --> 18:26.280
 in the array that was the photo and just slightly shifted.

18:26.280 --> 18:29.400
 Basically there was a function of R, function of G,

18:29.400 --> 18:32.480
 function of B that just shifted them slightly.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.000
 It was in rocket science.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.540
 And it turns out that actually

18:36.540 --> 18:38.520
 made your photo look pretty cool.

18:38.520 --> 18:42.820
 It just mapped from one color space to another color space.

18:42.820 --> 18:44.440
 It was simple, but it was really slow.

18:44.440 --> 18:47.320
 I mean, if you applied a filter,

18:47.320 --> 18:50.500
 I think it used to take two or three seconds to render.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.200
 Only eventually would I figure out how to do it on the GPU.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.400
 And I'm not even sure it was a GPU, but it was using OpenGL.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.960
 But anyway, I would eventually figure that out

18:59.960 --> 19:02.800
 and then it would be instant, but it used to be really slow.

19:02.800 --> 19:06.000
 By the way, anyone who's watching or listening,

19:06.000 --> 19:10.080
 it's amazing what you can get away with in a startup

19:10.080 --> 19:14.080
 as long as the product outcome is right for the user.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.440
 Like you can be slow.

19:15.440 --> 19:16.480
 You can be terrible.

19:16.480 --> 19:21.000
 You can be, as long as you have product market fit,

19:21.000 --> 19:22.440
 people will put up with a lot.

19:22.440 --> 19:24.960
 And then the question is just about compressing,

19:25.840 --> 19:27.640
 making it more performant over time

19:27.640 --> 19:30.440
 so that they get that product market fit instantly.

19:30.440 --> 19:32.800
 So fascinating because there's some things

19:32.800 --> 19:37.440
 where those three seconds would make or break the app,

19:37.440 --> 19:39.480
 but some things you're saying not.

19:39.480 --> 19:43.480
 It's hard to know when, it's the problem Spotify solved

19:43.480 --> 19:47.500
 for making streaming like work.

19:48.500 --> 19:53.060
 And like delays in listening to music is a huge negative,

19:53.060 --> 19:54.660
 even like slight delays.

19:55.480 --> 19:57.260
 But here you're saying, I mean,

19:57.260 --> 20:00.580
 how do you know when those three seconds are okay

20:00.580 --> 20:03.820
 or are you just gonna have to try it out?

20:03.820 --> 20:07.380
 Because to me, my intuition would be

20:07.380 --> 20:09.940
 those three seconds would kill the app.

20:09.940 --> 20:12.300
 Like I would try to do the OpenGL thing.

20:12.300 --> 20:16.220
 Right, so I wish I were that smart at the time.

20:17.600 --> 20:20.780
 I wasn't, I just knew how to do what I knew how to do.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.580
 And I decided, okay, like,

20:23.580 --> 20:27.220
 why don't I just iterate over the values and change them?

20:27.220 --> 20:29.580
 And what's interesting is that

20:31.820 --> 20:35.340
 compared to the alternatives, no one else used OpenGL.

20:35.340 --> 20:37.140
 So everyone else was doing it the dumb way.

20:37.140 --> 20:40.460
 And in fact, they were doing it at a high resolution.

20:40.460 --> 20:42.500
 Now comes in the small resolution

20:42.500 --> 20:45.140
 that we'll talk about in a second.

20:45.140 --> 20:48.620
 By choosing 512 pixels by 512 pixels,

20:48.620 --> 20:51.000
 which I believe it was at the time,

20:51.000 --> 20:54.340
 we iterated over a lot fewer pixels than our competitors

20:54.340 --> 20:58.180
 who were trying to do these enormous output like images.

20:58.180 --> 21:00.940
 So instead of taking 20 seconds,

21:00.940 --> 21:03.320
 I mean, three seconds feels pretty good, right?

21:03.320 --> 21:06.340
 So on a relative basis, we were winning like a lot.

21:06.340 --> 21:08.520
 Okay, so that's answer number one.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.580
 Answer number two is we actually focused

21:11.580 --> 21:13.140
 on latency in the right places.

21:13.140 --> 21:17.460
 So we did this really wonderful thing when you uploaded.

21:17.460 --> 21:20.900
 So the way it would work is you'd take your phone,

21:20.900 --> 21:24.040
 you'd take the photo and then you'd go to the,

21:25.040 --> 21:27.780
 you'd go to the edit screen where you would caption it.

21:28.820 --> 21:31.180
 And on that caption screen, you'd start typing

21:31.180 --> 21:34.180
 and you'd think, okay, like what's a clever caption?

21:34.180 --> 21:36.380
 And I said to Mike, hey, when I worked on the Gmail team,

21:36.380 --> 21:37.440
 you know what they did?

21:37.440 --> 21:40.820
 When you typed in your username or your email address,

21:40.820 --> 21:43.220
 even before you've entered in your password,

21:43.220 --> 21:47.100
 like the probability once you enter in your username

21:47.100 --> 21:51.100
 that you're going to actually sign in is extremely high.

21:51.100 --> 21:52.620
 So why not just start loading your account

21:52.620 --> 21:53.460
 in the background?

21:53.460 --> 21:55.700
 Not like sending it down to the desktop,

21:55.700 --> 21:59.380
 that would be a security issue,

21:59.380 --> 22:01.340
 but like loaded into memory on the server,

22:01.340 --> 22:03.600
 like get it ready, prepare it.

22:03.600 --> 22:06.980
 I always thought that was so fascinating and unintuitive.

22:06.980 --> 22:08.900
 And I was like, Mike, why don't we just do that?

22:08.900 --> 22:10.440
 But like, we'll just upload the photo

22:10.440 --> 22:14.140
 and like assume you're going to upload the photo.

22:14.140 --> 22:17.620
 And if you don't, forget about it, we'll delete it, right?

22:17.620 --> 22:20.340
 So what ended up happening was people would caption

22:20.340 --> 22:24.660
 their photo, they'd press done or upload

22:24.660 --> 22:27.940
 and you'd see this little progress bar just go foop.

22:27.940 --> 22:30.180
 It was lightning fast, okay?

22:30.180 --> 22:32.960
 We were no faster than anyone else at the time,

22:32.960 --> 22:37.420
 but by choosing 512 by 512 and doing it in the background,

22:37.420 --> 22:39.680
 it almost guaranteed that it was done

22:39.680 --> 22:41.340
 by the time you captioned.

22:41.340 --> 22:43.980
 And everyone when they used it was like,

22:43.980 --> 22:47.000
 how the hell is this thing so fast?

22:47.000 --> 22:49.340
 But we were slow, we just hid the slowness.

22:49.340 --> 22:51.460
 It wasn't like, these things are just like,

22:51.460 --> 22:54.240
 it's a shell game, you're just hiding the latency.

22:55.180 --> 22:58.720
 That mattered to people like a lot.

22:58.720 --> 23:01.020
 And I think that, so you were willing to put up

23:01.020 --> 23:03.500
 with a slow filter if it meant

23:03.500 --> 23:04.700
 you could share it immediately.

23:04.700 --> 23:06.580
 And of course we added sharing options

23:06.580 --> 23:08.220
 which let you distribute it really quickly,

23:08.220 --> 23:09.420
 that was the third part.

23:11.400 --> 23:14.520
 So latency matters, but relative to what?

23:14.520 --> 23:17.500
 And then there's some like tricks,

23:17.500 --> 23:20.580
 you get around to just hiding the latency.

23:20.580 --> 23:23.020
 Like I don't know if Spotify starts downloading

23:23.020 --> 23:25.740
 the next song eagerly, I'm assuming they do.

23:25.740 --> 23:29.300
 There are a bunch of ideas here that are not rocket science

23:29.300 --> 23:31.740
 that really help.

23:31.740 --> 23:35.100
 And all of that was stuff you were explicitly

23:35.100 --> 23:37.820
 having a discussion about, like those designs

23:37.820 --> 23:40.680
 and you were having like arguments, discussions.

23:41.660 --> 23:43.540
 I'm not sure it was arguments, I mean,

23:43.540 --> 23:45.480
 I'm not sure if you've met my co founder Mike,

23:45.480 --> 23:48.460
 but he's a pretty nice guy and he's very reasonable.

23:48.460 --> 23:51.220
 And we both just saw eye to eye and we're like,

23:51.220 --> 23:55.480
 yeah, it's like, make this fast or at least seem fast,

23:56.500 --> 23:57.340
 it'll be great.

23:57.340 --> 23:59.460
 Honestly, I think the most contentious thing

23:59.460 --> 24:01.260
 and he would say this too initially,

24:02.740 --> 24:07.740
 was I was on an iPhone 3G, so like the not so fast one.

24:08.300 --> 24:10.860
 And he had a brand new iPhone 4, that was cheap.

24:10.860 --> 24:12.500
 Nice.

24:12.500 --> 24:15.140
 And his feed loaded super smoothly,

24:15.140 --> 24:17.460
 like when he would scroll from photo to photo,

24:18.760 --> 24:20.380
 buttery smooth, right?

24:20.380 --> 24:22.780
 But on my phone, every time you got to a new photo,

24:22.780 --> 24:25.420
 it was like, kachunk, kachunk, allocate memory,

24:25.420 --> 24:27.460
 like all this stuff, right?

24:27.460 --> 24:29.300
 I was like, Mike, that's unacceptable.

24:29.300 --> 24:31.860
 He's like, oh, come on, man, just like upgrade your phone.

24:31.860 --> 24:33.260
 Basically, he didn't actually say that,

24:33.260 --> 24:34.460
 he was nicer than that.

24:35.780 --> 24:36.900
 But I could tell he wished like,

24:36.900 --> 24:39.680
 I would just stop being cheap and just get a new phone.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.540
 But what's funny is we actually sat there working

24:41.540 --> 24:45.420
 on that little detail for a few days before launch.

24:45.420 --> 24:48.620
 And that polished experience,

24:48.620 --> 24:51.060
 plus the fact that uploading seemed fast

24:51.060 --> 24:54.380
 for all these people who didn't have nice phones,

24:54.380 --> 24:57.820
 I think meant a lot because far too often,

24:57.820 --> 25:00.560
 you see teams focus not on performance,

25:00.560 --> 25:03.980
 they focus on what's the cool computer science problem

25:03.980 --> 25:05.940
 they can solve, right?

25:05.940 --> 25:08.500
 Can we scale this thing to a billion users

25:08.500 --> 25:11.040
 and they've got like a hundred, right?

25:11.040 --> 25:11.880
 Yeah.

25:12.780 --> 25:14.020
 You talked about loss function,

25:14.020 --> 25:16.060
 so I want to come back to that.

25:16.060 --> 25:17.780
 Like the loss function is like,

25:17.780 --> 25:20.700
 do you provide a great, happy, magical,

25:20.700 --> 25:23.160
 whatever experience for the consumer?

25:23.160 --> 25:25.980
 And listen, if it happens to involve something complex

25:25.980 --> 25:27.760
 and technical, then great.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.800
 But it turns out, I think most of the time,

25:32.260 --> 25:34.820
 those experiences are just sitting there waiting to be built

25:34.820 --> 25:37.800
 with like not that complex solutions.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.860
 But everyone is just like so stuck in their own head

25:40.860 --> 25:42.660
 that they have to overengineer everything

25:42.660 --> 25:45.020
 and then they forget about the easy stuff.

25:45.020 --> 25:48.460
 I mean, also, maybe to flip the loss function there is,

25:48.460 --> 25:50.780
 you're trying to minimize the number of times

25:50.780 --> 25:54.040
 there's unpleasant experience, right?

25:54.040 --> 25:56.100
 Like the one you mentioned where when you go

25:56.100 --> 25:58.460
 to the next photo, it freezes for a little bit.

25:58.460 --> 26:00.960
 So it's almost, as opposed to maximizing pleasure,

26:00.960 --> 26:04.720
 it's probably easier to minimize the number of like,

26:04.720 --> 26:05.860
 the friction.

26:05.860 --> 26:06.700
 Yeah.

26:06.700 --> 26:10.420
 And as we all know, you just make the pleasure negative

26:10.420 --> 26:13.060
 and then minimize everything, so.

26:13.060 --> 26:14.980
 We're mapping this all back to neural networks.

26:14.980 --> 26:16.560
 But actually, can I say one thing on that,

26:16.560 --> 26:19.760
 which is I don't know a lot about machine learning,

26:19.760 --> 26:23.060
 but I feel like I've tried studying a bunch.

26:23.060 --> 26:25.900
 That whole idea of reinforcement learning

26:26.880 --> 26:30.620
 and planning out more than the greedy single experience,

26:30.620 --> 26:34.060
 I think is the closest you can get

26:34.060 --> 26:38.580
 to like ideal product design thinking,

26:38.580 --> 26:39.980
 where you're not saying,

26:39.980 --> 26:43.740
 hey, like, can we have a great experience just this one time?

26:43.740 --> 26:46.340
 But like, what is the right way to onboard someone?

26:46.340 --> 26:50.060
 What series of experiences correlate most with them

26:50.060 --> 26:52.660
 hanging on long term, right?

26:52.660 --> 26:55.620
 So not just saying, oh, did the photo load slowly

26:55.620 --> 26:57.940
 a couple of times, or did they get a great photo

26:57.940 --> 27:00.060
 at the top of their feed?

27:00.060 --> 27:01.860
 But like, what are the things that are gonna make

27:01.860 --> 27:04.940
 this person come back over the next week,

27:04.940 --> 27:06.380
 over the next month?

27:06.380 --> 27:08.460
 And as a product designer asking yourself,

27:08.460 --> 27:11.720
 okay, I wanna optimize, not just minimize bad experiences

27:11.720 --> 27:13.060
 in the short run, but like,

27:13.060 --> 27:17.900
 how do I get someone to engage over the next month?

27:17.900 --> 27:20.780
 And I'm not gonna claim at all that I thought that way

27:20.780 --> 27:23.120
 at all at the time, because I certainly didn't.

27:23.120 --> 27:25.540
 But if I were going back and giving myself any advice,

27:25.540 --> 27:28.700
 it would be thinking, what are those second order effects

27:28.700 --> 27:30.380
 that you can create?

27:30.380 --> 27:33.380
 And it turns out having your friends on the service

27:33.380 --> 27:34.860
 is an enormous win.

27:34.860 --> 27:37.580
 So starting with a very small group of people

27:37.580 --> 27:40.520
 that produce content that you wanted to see, which we did,

27:40.520 --> 27:43.860
 we seeded the community very well, I think.

27:43.860 --> 27:46.620
 Ended up mattering, and so.

27:46.620 --> 27:48.200
 Yeah, you said that community is one

27:48.200 --> 27:49.660
 of the most important things.

27:49.660 --> 27:52.020
 So it's from a metrics perspective,

27:52.020 --> 27:55.220
 from maybe a philosophy perspective,

27:55.220 --> 27:57.900
 building a certain kind of community within the app.

27:57.900 --> 28:00.580
 See, I wasn't sure what exactly you meant by that

28:00.580 --> 28:01.940
 when I first heard you say that.

28:01.940 --> 28:04.420
 Maybe you can elaborate, but as I understand now,

28:04.420 --> 28:09.420
 it can literally mean get your friends onto the app.

28:09.420 --> 28:11.960
 Yeah, think of it this way.

28:12.900 --> 28:16.700
 You can build an amazing restaurant or bar or whatever,

28:16.700 --> 28:20.300
 right, but if you show up and you're the only one there,

28:20.300 --> 28:22.920
 is it like, does it matter how good the food is?

28:24.020 --> 28:25.620
 The drinks, whatever?

28:25.620 --> 28:28.820
 No, these are inherently social experiences

28:28.820 --> 28:30.460
 that we were working on.

28:30.460 --> 28:34.320
 So the idea of having people there,

28:35.580 --> 28:36.900
 like you needed to have that,

28:36.900 --> 28:39.220
 otherwise it was just a filter out.

28:39.220 --> 28:41.380
 But by the way, part of the genius,

28:41.380 --> 28:43.900
 I'm gonna say genius, even though it wasn't really genius,

28:43.900 --> 28:48.900
 was starting to be marauding as a filter app was awesome.

28:50.300 --> 28:51.220
 The fact that you could,

28:51.220 --> 28:53.020
 so we talk about single player mode a lot,

28:53.020 --> 28:55.380
 which is like, can you play the game alone?

28:56.280 --> 28:57.980
 And Instagram, you could totally play alone.

28:57.980 --> 28:59.380
 You could filter your photos,

28:59.380 --> 29:00.900
 and a lot of people would tell me,

29:00.900 --> 29:04.580
 I didn't even realize that this thing was a social network

29:04.580 --> 29:06.140
 until my friend showed up.

29:06.140 --> 29:09.580
 It totally worked as a single player game.

29:09.580 --> 29:10.940
 And then when your friends showed up,

29:10.940 --> 29:11.780
 all of a sudden it was like,

29:11.780 --> 29:14.100
 oh, not only was this great alone,

29:14.100 --> 29:16.940
 but now I actually have this trove of photos

29:16.940 --> 29:19.380
 that people can look at and start liking,

29:19.380 --> 29:20.500
 and then I can like theirs.

29:20.500 --> 29:23.180
 And so it was this bootstrap method

29:23.180 --> 29:25.180
 of how do you make the thing not suck

29:25.180 --> 29:27.040
 when the restaurant is empty?

29:27.040 --> 29:29.660
 Yeah, but the thing is, when you say friends,

29:29.660 --> 29:31.700
 we're not necessarily referring to friends

29:31.700 --> 29:32.780
 in the physical space.

29:32.780 --> 29:35.340
 So you're not bringing your physical friends with you.

29:35.340 --> 29:36.740
 You're also making new friends.

29:36.740 --> 29:38.380
 So you're finding new community.

29:38.380 --> 29:40.140
 So it's not immediately obvious to me

29:40.140 --> 29:45.020
 that it's almost like building any kind of community.

29:45.020 --> 29:46.540
 It was both.

29:46.540 --> 29:48.620
 And what we learned very early on

29:48.620 --> 29:50.160
 was what made Instagram special

29:50.160 --> 29:51.860
 and the reason why you would sign up for it

29:51.860 --> 29:53.500
 versus say, just sit on Facebook

29:53.500 --> 29:55.820
 and look at your friends photos.

29:55.820 --> 29:56.900
 Of course we were live,

29:56.900 --> 29:58.220
 and of course it was interesting

29:58.220 --> 30:00.340
 to see what your friends were doing now.

30:00.340 --> 30:02.140
 But the fact that you could connect with people

30:02.140 --> 30:05.300
 who like took really beautiful photos in a certain style

30:05.300 --> 30:07.320
 all around the world, whether they were travelers,

30:07.320 --> 30:11.380
 it was the beginning of the influencer economy.

30:11.380 --> 30:12.220
 It was these people

30:12.220 --> 30:14.780
 who became professional Instagrammers way back when.

30:16.660 --> 30:18.800
 But they took these amazing photos

30:18.800 --> 30:23.800
 and some of them were photographers professionally.

30:24.100 --> 30:25.900
 And all of a sudden you had this moment in the day

30:25.900 --> 30:27.140
 when you could open up this app

30:27.140 --> 30:28.900
 and sure you could see what your friends were doing,

30:28.900 --> 30:30.320
 but also it was like, oh my God,

30:30.320 --> 30:33.080
 that's a beautiful waterfall or oh my God,

30:33.080 --> 30:35.100
 I didn't realize there was that corner of England

30:35.100 --> 30:37.220
 or like really cool stuff.

30:38.700 --> 30:40.280
 And the beauty about Instagram early on

30:40.280 --> 30:43.940
 was that it was international by default.

30:43.940 --> 30:46.740
 You didn't have to speak English to use it, right?

30:46.740 --> 30:49.780
 You could just look at the photos, works great.

30:49.780 --> 30:52.360
 We did translate, we had some pretty bad translations,

30:52.360 --> 30:54.420
 but we did translate the app.

30:54.420 --> 30:57.860
 And even if our translations were pretty poor,

30:57.860 --> 31:00.100
 the idea that you could just connect with other people

31:00.100 --> 31:02.280
 through their images was pretty powerful.

31:02.280 --> 31:05.760
 So how much technical difficulties

31:05.760 --> 31:07.120
 there with the programming?

31:07.120 --> 31:09.120
 Like what programming language you were talking about?

31:09.120 --> 31:09.960
 What was?

31:09.960 --> 31:12.040
 Zero, like maybe it was hard for us,

31:12.040 --> 31:16.280
 but I mean, there was nothing.

31:16.280 --> 31:18.700
 The only thing that was complex about Instagram

31:18.700 --> 31:23.680
 at the beginning technically was making it scale.

31:23.680 --> 31:27.920
 We were just plain old Objective C for the client.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.480
 So it was iPhone only at first?

31:29.480 --> 31:30.880
 iPhone only, yep.

31:30.880 --> 31:34.080
 As an Android person, I'm deeply offended, but go ahead.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.880
 This was 2010.

31:35.880 --> 31:36.720
 Oh, sure, sure.

31:36.720 --> 31:37.560
 Sorry, sorry.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.680
 Android's getting a lot better, right?

31:39.680 --> 31:40.960
 So.

31:40.960 --> 31:41.840
 I take it back, you're right.

31:41.840 --> 31:43.160
 If I were to do something today,

31:43.160 --> 31:44.440
 I think it would be very different

31:44.440 --> 31:46.680
 in terms of launch strategy, right?

31:46.680 --> 31:48.280
 Android's enormous too.

31:49.180 --> 31:51.160
 But anyway, back to that moment,

31:51.160 --> 31:56.160
 it was Objective C and then we were Python based,

31:56.920 --> 32:00.220
 which is just like, this is before Python was really cool.

32:00.220 --> 32:01.200
 Like now it's cool

32:01.200 --> 32:03.080
 because it's all these machine learning libraries

32:03.080 --> 32:05.240
 like support Python and right.

32:05.240 --> 32:08.120
 Now it's super, now it's like cool to be Python.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.800
 Back then it was like, oh, Google uses Python.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.600
 Like maybe you should use Python.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.360
 Facebook was PHP.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.760
 Like I had worked at a small startup

32:16.760 --> 32:19.320
 of some ex Googlers that used Python.

32:19.320 --> 32:22.480
 So we used it and we used a framework called Django,

32:22.480 --> 32:27.260
 still exists and people use for basically the backend.

32:27.260 --> 32:30.120
 And then you threw a couple interesting things in there.

32:30.120 --> 32:32.160
 I mean, we used Postgres, which was kind of fun.

32:32.160 --> 32:34.120
 It was a little bit like Hipster database

32:34.120 --> 32:34.960
 at the time, right?

32:34.960 --> 32:36.160
 Versus MySQL.

32:36.160 --> 32:37.920
 MySQL, like everyone used MySQL.

32:37.920 --> 32:40.520
 So like using Postgres was like an interesting decision.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.080
 Right?

32:42.080 --> 32:45.320
 But we used it because it had a bunch of geo features

32:45.320 --> 32:46.840
 built in because we thought we were gonna be

32:46.840 --> 32:47.880
 a check and app, remember?

32:47.880 --> 32:49.280
 It's also super cool now.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.480
 So you were into Python before it was cool

32:51.480 --> 32:53.480
 and you were into Postgres before it was cool.

32:53.480 --> 32:55.060
 Yeah, we were basically like,

32:55.060 --> 32:57.960
 not only Hipster photo company,

32:57.960 --> 33:00.100
 Hipster tech company, right?

33:00.100 --> 33:04.000
 We also adopted Redis early and like loved it.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.960
 I mean, it solves so many problems for us

33:06.960 --> 33:09.580
 and turns out that's still pretty cool.

33:09.580 --> 33:11.260
 But the programming was very easy.

33:11.260 --> 33:13.920
 It was like, sign up a user, have a feed.

33:13.920 --> 33:17.440
 There was nothing, no machine learning at all, zero.

33:17.440 --> 33:18.400
 Can you get some context?

33:18.400 --> 33:20.720
 How many users at each of these stages?

33:20.720 --> 33:24.100
 Are we talking about a hundred users, a thousand users?

33:24.100 --> 33:25.640
 So the stage I just described,

33:25.640 --> 33:27.900
 I mean that technical stack lasted

33:27.900 --> 33:30.940
 through probably 50 million users.

33:32.720 --> 33:36.120
 I mean, seriously, like you can get away with a lot

33:36.120 --> 33:38.360
 with a pretty basic stack.

33:38.360 --> 33:41.060
 Like I think a lot of startups try to overengineer

33:41.060 --> 33:43.640
 their solutions from the beginning to like really scale

33:43.640 --> 33:45.640
 and you can get away with a lot.

33:45.640 --> 33:48.560
 That being said, most of the first two years of Instagram

33:48.560 --> 33:51.280
 was literally just trying to make that stack scale.

33:51.280 --> 33:54.120
 And it wasn't, it was not a Python problem.

33:54.120 --> 33:58.040
 It was like literally just like, where do we put the data?

33:58.040 --> 33:59.920
 Like it's all coming in too fast.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.000
 Like how do we store it?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.360
 How do we make sure to be up?

34:02.360 --> 34:05.840
 How do we like, how do we make sure we're

34:05.840 --> 34:09.320
 on the right size boxes that they have enough memory?

34:09.320 --> 34:11.200
 Those were the issues, but.

34:11.200 --> 34:14.280
 Can you speak to the choices you make at that stage

34:14.280 --> 34:16.200
 when you're growing so quickly?

34:16.200 --> 34:18.480
 Do you use something like somebody else's

34:18.480 --> 34:22.640
 computer infrastructure or do you build in house?

34:22.640 --> 34:25.640
 I'm only laughing because we, when we launched

34:25.640 --> 34:30.640
 we had a single computer that we had rented

34:30.700 --> 34:32.160
 in some color space in LA.

34:32.160 --> 34:34.720
 I don't even remember what it was called.

34:34.720 --> 34:35.940
 Cause I thought that's what you did.

34:35.940 --> 34:38.520
 When I worked at a company called Odio that became Twitter.

34:38.520 --> 34:41.200
 I remember visiting our space in San Francisco.

34:41.200 --> 34:43.480
 You walked in, you had to wear the ear things.

34:43.480 --> 34:46.880
 It was cold and fans everywhere, right?

34:46.880 --> 34:49.940
 And we had to, you know, plug one out, replace one.

34:49.940 --> 34:52.720
 And I was the intern, so I just like held things.

34:52.720 --> 34:54.960
 But I thought to myself, oh, this is how it goes.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.520
 And then I remember being in a VC's office.

34:58.480 --> 35:00.040
 I think it was a benchmarks office.

35:00.040 --> 35:02.280
 And I think we ran into another entrepreneur

35:02.280 --> 35:03.560
 and they were like, oh, how are things going?

35:03.560 --> 35:06.840
 We're like, ah, you know, try to scale this thing.

35:06.840 --> 35:08.420
 And they were like, well, I mean

35:08.420 --> 35:09.960
 can't you just add more instances?

35:09.960 --> 35:11.540
 And I was like, what do you mean?

35:11.540 --> 35:13.560
 And they're like instances on Amazon.

35:13.560 --> 35:15.520
 I was like, what are those?

35:15.520 --> 35:18.240
 And it was this moment where we realized how deep

35:18.240 --> 35:22.980
 in it we were because we had no idea that AWS existed

35:22.980 --> 35:24.420
 nor should we be using it.

35:24.420 --> 35:27.000
 Anyway, that night we went back to the office

35:27.000 --> 35:29.840
 and we got on AWS, but we did this really dumb thing.

35:29.840 --> 35:32.960
 We're so sorry to people listening.

35:32.960 --> 35:37.960
 But we brought up an instance, which was our database.

35:38.300 --> 35:40.920
 It's gonna be a replacement for our database.

35:40.920 --> 35:43.720
 But we had it talking over the public internet

35:43.720 --> 35:46.560
 to our little box in LA that was our app server.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.380
 Very nice. Yeah.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.960
 That's how sophisticated we were.

35:49.960 --> 35:51.960
 And obviously that was very, very slow.

35:52.840 --> 35:53.840
 Didn't work at all.

35:53.840 --> 35:55.960
 I mean, it worked, but didn't work.

35:55.960 --> 35:58.080
 Only like later that night did we realize

35:58.080 --> 36:00.160
 we had to have it all together.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.120
 But at least like if you're listening right now

36:02.120 --> 36:04.740
 and you're thinking, you know, I have no chance.

36:04.740 --> 36:06.920
 I'm gonna start to start, but I have no chance.

36:06.920 --> 36:07.760
 I don't know.

36:07.760 --> 36:08.580
 We did it and we made a bunch

36:08.580 --> 36:10.640
 of really dumb mistakes initially.

36:10.640 --> 36:12.540
 I think the question is how quickly do you learn

36:12.540 --> 36:13.560
 that you're making a mistake?

36:13.560 --> 36:16.360
 And do you do the right thing immediately right after?

36:16.360 --> 36:20.320
 So you didn't pay for those mistakes by failure.

36:20.320 --> 36:23.840
 So yeah, how quickly did you fix it?

36:23.840 --> 36:26.280
 I guess there's a lot of ways to sneak up to this question

36:26.280 --> 36:28.440
 of how the hell do you scale the thing?

36:28.440 --> 36:30.360
 Other startups, if you have an idea,

36:30.360 --> 36:31.640
 how do you scale the thing?

36:31.640 --> 36:36.640
 Is it just AWS and you try to write the kind of code

36:37.680 --> 36:41.820
 that's easy to spread across a large number of instances,

36:41.820 --> 36:45.180
 and then the rest is just put money into it?

36:45.180 --> 36:48.860
 Basically, I would say a couple of things.

36:48.860 --> 36:51.580
 First off, don't even ask the question,

36:51.580 --> 36:55.460
 just find product market fit, duct tape it together, right?

36:55.460 --> 36:56.620
 Like if you have to.

36:56.620 --> 36:59.540
 I think there's a big caveat here, which I want to get to,

37:00.400 --> 37:03.800
 but generally all that matters is product market fit.

37:03.800 --> 37:04.860
 That's all that matters.

37:04.860 --> 37:06.880
 If people like your product,

37:06.880 --> 37:10.300
 do not worry about when 50,000 people use your product

37:10.300 --> 37:12.760
 because you will be happy that you have that problem

37:12.760 --> 37:13.920
 when you get there.

37:13.920 --> 37:18.660
 I actually can't name many startups

37:18.660 --> 37:22.100
 where they go from nothing to something overnight

37:22.100 --> 37:24.260
 and they can't figure out how to scale it.

37:24.260 --> 37:27.620
 There are some, but I think nowadays,

37:27.620 --> 37:29.640
 it's a, when I say a solved problem,

37:29.640 --> 37:32.180
 like there are ways of solving it.

37:33.260 --> 37:35.060
 The base case is typically that startups

37:35.060 --> 37:38.000
 worry way too much about scaling way too early

37:38.000 --> 37:39.800
 and forget that they actually have to make something

37:39.800 --> 37:40.640
 that people like.

37:40.640 --> 37:43.740
 That's the default mistake case.

37:43.740 --> 37:48.020
 But what I'll say is once you start scaling,

37:48.020 --> 37:49.820
 I mean, hiring quickly,

37:49.820 --> 37:51.460
 people who have seen the game before

37:51.460 --> 37:52.980
 and just know how to do it,

37:52.980 --> 37:56.660
 it becomes a bit of like, yeah,

37:56.660 --> 37:59.340
 just throw instances of the problem, right?

37:59.340 --> 38:00.740
 But the last thing I'll say on this

38:00.740 --> 38:02.300
 that I think did save us,

38:03.420 --> 38:06.700
 we were pretty rigorous about writing tests

38:06.700 --> 38:07.620
 from the beginning.

38:08.560 --> 38:11.420
 That helped us move very, very quickly

38:11.420 --> 38:14.620
 when we wanted to rewrite parts of the product

38:14.620 --> 38:17.260
 and know that we weren't breaking something else.

38:17.260 --> 38:18.700
 Tests are one of those things where it's like,

38:18.700 --> 38:20.660
 you go slow to go fast.

38:20.660 --> 38:22.940
 And they suck when you have to write them

38:22.940 --> 38:24.180
 because you have to figure it out.

38:24.180 --> 38:27.000
 And there are always those ones that break

38:27.000 --> 38:29.060
 when you don't want them to break and they're annoying

38:29.060 --> 38:30.420
 and it feels like you spent all this time.

38:30.420 --> 38:34.740
 But looking back, I think that like longterm optimal,

38:34.740 --> 38:36.900
 even with a team of four,

38:36.900 --> 38:38.780
 it allowed us to move very, very quickly

38:38.780 --> 38:41.940
 because anyone could touch any part of the product

38:41.940 --> 38:44.440
 and know that they weren't gonna bring down the site,

38:44.440 --> 38:45.900
 or at least in general.

38:45.900 --> 38:48.660
 At which point do you know product market fit?

38:48.660 --> 38:50.540
 How many users would you say?

38:50.540 --> 38:52.540
 Is it all it takes is like 10 people?

38:52.540 --> 38:53.780
 Or is it a thousand?

38:53.780 --> 38:55.820
 Is it 50,000?

38:55.820 --> 38:58.220
 I don't think it is generally

38:58.220 --> 38:59.880
 a question of absolute numbers.

38:59.880 --> 39:01.860
 I think it's a question of cohorts

39:01.860 --> 39:03.900
 and I think it's a question of trends.

39:03.900 --> 39:08.780
 So, you know, it depends how big your business is trying

39:08.780 --> 39:09.620
 to be, right?

39:09.620 --> 39:12.260
 But if I were signing up a thousand people a week

39:12.260 --> 39:14.100
 and they all retain,

39:14.100 --> 39:16.980
 like the retention curves for those cohorts looked good,

39:16.980 --> 39:19.740
 healthy, and even like,

39:19.740 --> 39:21.940
 as you started getting more people on the service,

39:21.940 --> 39:24.660
 maybe those earlier cohorts started curving up again

39:24.660 --> 39:26.060
 because now there are network effects

39:26.060 --> 39:27.380
 and their friends are on the service

39:27.380 --> 39:29.860
 or totally depends what type of business you're in,

39:29.860 --> 39:34.060
 but I'm talking purely social, right?

39:34.060 --> 39:36.580
 I don't think it's an absolute number.

39:36.580 --> 39:37.900
 I think it is,

39:37.900 --> 39:39.660
 I guess you could call it a marginal number.

39:39.660 --> 39:42.340
 So I spent a lot of time when I work with startups

39:42.340 --> 39:44.380
 asking them like, okay,

39:44.380 --> 39:47.260
 have you looked at that cohort versus this cohort,

39:47.260 --> 39:48.500
 whether it's your clients

39:48.500 --> 39:52.300
 or whether it's people signing up for the service?

39:52.300 --> 39:55.180
 But a lot of people think you just have to hit some mark,

39:55.180 --> 39:57.780
 like 10,000 people or 50,000 people,

39:57.780 --> 40:01.980
 but really seven ish billion people in the world.

40:01.980 --> 40:05.300
 Most people forever will not know about your product.

40:05.300 --> 40:07.860
 There are always more people out there to sign up.

40:07.860 --> 40:11.380
 It's just a question of how you turn on the spigot, so.

40:11.380 --> 40:14.940
 At that stage, early stage yourself,

40:14.940 --> 40:16.700
 but also by way of advice,

40:16.700 --> 40:18.220
 should you worry about money at all?

40:18.220 --> 40:20.340
 How this thing's gonna make money?

40:20.340 --> 40:24.300
 Or do you just try to find product market fit

40:24.300 --> 40:27.780
 and get a lot of users to enjoy using your thing?

40:28.660 --> 40:30.020
 I think it totally depends.

40:30.020 --> 40:32.620
 And that's an unsatisfying answer.

40:32.620 --> 40:35.420
 I was talking with a friend today who,

40:36.460 --> 40:39.100
 he was one of our earlier investors and he was saying,

40:39.100 --> 40:41.580
 hey, like, have you been doing any angel investing lately?

40:41.580 --> 40:42.540
 I said, not really.

40:42.540 --> 40:44.780
 I'm just like focused on what I wanna do next.

40:44.780 --> 40:49.780
 And he said, the number of financings have just gone bonkers.

40:49.780 --> 40:54.460
 Like people are throwing money everywhere right now.

40:56.340 --> 41:00.580
 And I think the question is,

41:00.580 --> 41:04.140
 do you have an inkling of how you're gonna make money?

41:04.140 --> 41:07.420
 Or are you really just like waving your hands?

41:07.420 --> 41:11.460
 I would not like to be an entrepreneur in the position of,

41:11.460 --> 41:14.420
 well, I have no idea how this will eventually make money.

41:14.420 --> 41:15.260
 That's not fun.

41:16.980 --> 41:18.740
 If you are in an area,

41:18.740 --> 41:22.900
 like let's say you wanted to start a social network, right?

41:22.900 --> 41:25.900
 Not saying this is a good idea, but if you did,

41:25.900 --> 41:27.780
 there are only a handful of ways they've made money

41:27.780 --> 41:29.820
 and really only one way they've made money in the past

41:29.820 --> 41:30.900
 and that's ads.

41:31.780 --> 41:36.780
 So, if you have a service that's amenable to that

41:37.300 --> 41:39.780
 and then I wouldn't worry too much about that

41:39.780 --> 41:40.900
 because if you get to the scale,

41:40.900 --> 41:44.220
 you can hire some smart people and figure that out.

41:44.220 --> 41:48.620
 I do think that is really healthy for a lot of startups

41:48.620 --> 41:50.260
 these days, especially the ones doing

41:50.260 --> 41:54.820
 like enterprise software, slacks of the world, et cetera,

41:54.820 --> 41:56.660
 to be worried about money from the beginning,

41:56.660 --> 42:00.180
 but mostly as a way of winning over clients

42:00.180 --> 42:01.580
 and having stickiness.

42:05.500 --> 42:06.940
 Of course you need to be worried about money,

42:06.940 --> 42:08.620
 but I'm gonna also say this again,

42:08.620 --> 42:12.100
 which is it's like longterm profitability.

42:12.100 --> 42:15.860
 If you have a roadmap to that, then that's great.

42:15.860 --> 42:18.100
 But if you're just like, I don't know, maybe never,

42:18.100 --> 42:19.860
 like we're working on this metaverse thing,

42:19.860 --> 42:22.900
 I think maybe someday, I don't know.

42:22.900 --> 42:24.700
 Like that seems harder to me.

42:24.700 --> 42:26.740
 So you have to be as big as Facebook

42:26.740 --> 42:29.420
 to like finance that bet, right?

42:29.420 --> 42:31.180
 Do you think it's possible, you said,

42:31.180 --> 42:33.380
 you're not saying it's necessarily a good idea

42:33.380 --> 42:35.260
 to launch a social network.

42:35.260 --> 42:38.980
 Do you think it's possible today,

42:38.980 --> 42:41.260
 maybe you can put yourself in those shoes,

42:41.260 --> 42:45.420
 to launch a social network that achieves the scale

42:45.420 --> 42:49.500
 of a Facebook or a Twitter or an Instagram,

42:49.500 --> 42:51.300
 and maybe even greater scale?

42:51.300 --> 42:52.140
 Absolutely.

42:53.300 --> 42:54.180
 How do you do it?

42:55.460 --> 42:56.380
 Asking for a friend.

42:56.380 --> 42:59.020
 Yeah, if I knew, I'd probably be doing it right now

42:59.020 --> 43:00.060
 and not sitting here.

43:00.940 --> 43:03.580
 So, I mean, there's a lot of ways to ask this question.

43:03.580 --> 43:07.220
 One is create a totally new product market fit,

43:07.220 --> 43:10.300
 create a new market, create something like Instagram did,

43:10.300 --> 43:13.100
 which is like create something kind of new,

43:13.100 --> 43:17.060
 or literally out compete Facebook at its own thing,

43:17.060 --> 43:19.820
 or I'll compete Twitter at its own thing.

43:19.820 --> 43:21.500
 The only way to compete now,

43:21.500 --> 43:23.780
 if you wanna build a large social network

43:23.780 --> 43:26.820
 is to look for the cracks, look for the openings.

43:28.980 --> 43:31.340
 No one competed, I mean,

43:31.340 --> 43:33.420
 no one competed with the core business of Google.

43:33.420 --> 43:36.860
 No one competed with the core business of Microsoft.

43:36.860 --> 43:39.380
 You don't go at the big guys

43:39.380 --> 43:41.860
 doing exactly what they're doing.

43:41.860 --> 43:43.900
 Instagram didn't win, quote unquote,

43:43.900 --> 43:46.940
 because it tried to be a visual Twitter.

43:46.940 --> 43:49.980
 Like we spotted things that either Twitter

43:49.980 --> 43:52.820
 wasn't going to do or refuse to do,

43:52.820 --> 43:55.980
 images and feed for the longest time, right?

43:55.980 --> 43:58.540
 Or that Facebook wasn't doing or not paying attention to

43:58.540 --> 44:00.620
 because they were mostly desktop at the time

44:00.620 --> 44:03.700
 and we were purely mobile, purely visual.

44:05.060 --> 44:07.620
 Often there are opportunities sitting there.

44:07.620 --> 44:12.020
 You have to figure out like,

44:12.020 --> 44:13.860
 I think like there's a strategy book,

44:13.860 --> 44:14.780
 I can't remember the name,

44:14.780 --> 44:19.700
 but talk about moats and just like the best place to play

44:19.700 --> 44:22.220
 is where your competitor literally can't pivot

44:22.220 --> 44:26.060
 because structurally they're set up not to be there.

44:26.060 --> 44:28.100
 And that's where you win.

44:28.100 --> 44:30.460
 And what's fascinating is like,

44:30.460 --> 44:31.980
 do you know how many people were like,

44:31.980 --> 44:35.260
 images, Facebook does that, Twitter does that.

44:35.260 --> 44:37.220
 I mean, how wrong were they, really wrong?

44:37.220 --> 44:38.580
 And these are some of the smartest people

44:38.580 --> 44:40.420
 in Silicon Valley, right?

44:40.420 --> 44:42.740
 But now Instagram exists for a while.

44:42.740 --> 44:45.220
 How is it that Snapchat could then exist?

44:45.220 --> 44:47.300
 It makes no sense.

44:47.300 --> 44:48.720
 Like plenty of people would say,

44:48.720 --> 44:50.140
 well, there's Facebook, no images.

44:50.140 --> 44:52.820
 Okay, okay, Instagram, I'll give you that one.

44:52.820 --> 44:55.260
 But wait, now another image based social network

44:55.260 --> 44:57.140
 is gonna get really big.

44:57.140 --> 44:58.780
 And then TikTok comes along.

44:59.980 --> 45:03.500
 Like the prior, so you asked me, is it possible?

45:03.500 --> 45:05.700
 The only reason I'm answering yes

45:05.700 --> 45:09.620
 is because my prior is that it's happened once every,

45:09.620 --> 45:13.020
 I don't know, three, four or five years consistently.

45:13.020 --> 45:15.340
 And I can't imagine there's anything structurally

45:15.340 --> 45:16.660
 that would change that.

45:17.620 --> 45:18.980
 So that's why I answer that way.

45:18.980 --> 45:21.260
 Not because I know how, I just,

45:21.260 --> 45:22.900
 when you see a pattern, you see a pattern

45:22.900 --> 45:25.580
 and there's no reason to believe that's gonna stop.

45:25.580 --> 45:27.780
 And it's subtle too, because like you said,

45:27.780 --> 45:29.720
 Snapchat and TikTok,

45:29.720 --> 45:32.660
 they're all doing the same space of things,

45:32.660 --> 45:34.820
 but there's something fundamentally different

45:34.820 --> 45:38.740
 about like a three second video and a five second video

45:38.740 --> 45:41.020
 and a 15 second video and a one minute video

45:41.020 --> 45:43.900
 and a one hour video, like fundamentally different.

45:43.900 --> 45:45.020
 Fundamentally different.

45:45.020 --> 45:48.260
 I mean, I think one of the reasons Snapchat exists

45:48.260 --> 45:51.660
 is because Instagram was so focused on posting great,

45:51.660 --> 45:56.660
 beautiful manicured versions of yourself throughout time.

45:57.180 --> 45:58.780
 And there was this enormous demand of like,

45:58.780 --> 46:00.740
 hey, I really like this behavior.

46:00.740 --> 46:03.400
 I love using Instagram, but man,

46:03.400 --> 46:06.720
 I just like wish I could share something going on in my day.

46:07.940 --> 46:10.000
 Do I really have to put it on my profile?

46:10.000 --> 46:11.900
 Do I really have to make it last forever?

46:11.900 --> 46:14.680
 Do I really, and that opened up a door,

46:14.680 --> 46:16.660
 it created a market, right?

46:16.660 --> 46:20.460
 And then what's fascinating is Instagram had an explore page

46:20.460 --> 46:23.740
 for the longest time and it was image driven, right?

46:23.740 --> 46:26.780
 But there's absolutely a behavior where you open up Instagram

46:26.780 --> 46:28.340
 and you sit on the explore page all day.

46:28.340 --> 46:29.900
 That is effectively TikTok,

46:29.900 --> 46:32.540
 but obviously focused on videos.

46:32.540 --> 46:35.420
 And it's not like you could just put the explore page

46:35.420 --> 46:37.140
 in TikTok form and it works.

46:37.140 --> 46:39.740
 It had to be video, it had to have music.

46:39.740 --> 46:42.380
 These are the hard parts about product development

46:42.380 --> 46:44.180
 that are very hard to predict,

46:44.180 --> 46:47.940
 but they're all versions of the same thing

46:47.940 --> 46:50.980
 with varying, like if you line them up

46:50.980 --> 46:54.300
 in a bunch of dimensions, they're just like kind of on,

46:55.180 --> 46:56.980
 they're different values of the same dimensions,

46:56.980 --> 46:59.680
 which is like, I guess, easy to say in retrospect.

46:59.680 --> 47:02.580
 But like, if I were an entrepreneur going after that area,

47:02.580 --> 47:05.140
 I'd ask myself like, where's the opening?

47:05.140 --> 47:08.500
 What needs to exist because TikTok exists now?

47:08.500 --> 47:13.060
 So I wonder how much things that don't yet exist

47:13.060 --> 47:15.880
 and can exist is in the space of algorithms,

47:15.880 --> 47:18.020
 in the space of recommender systems.

47:18.020 --> 47:21.680
 So in the space of how the feed is generated.

47:21.680 --> 47:24.180
 So we kind of talk about the actual elements

47:24.180 --> 47:27.900
 of the content, that's what we've been talking,

47:27.900 --> 47:29.840
 the difference between photos,

47:29.840 --> 47:32.440
 between short videos, longer videos.

47:32.440 --> 47:35.140
 I wonder how much disruption is possible

47:35.140 --> 47:37.260
 in the way the algorithms work.

47:37.260 --> 47:39.540
 Because a lot of the criticism towards social media

47:39.540 --> 47:41.900
 is in the way the algorithms work currently.

47:41.900 --> 47:44.620
 And it feels like, first of all,

47:44.620 --> 47:47.340
 talking about product market fit,

47:47.340 --> 47:52.340
 there's certainly a hunger for social media algorithms

47:54.420 --> 47:56.860
 that do something different.

47:56.860 --> 47:59.580
 I don't think anyone, everyone said complaining,

47:59.580 --> 48:04.180
 this is hurting me and this is hurting society,

48:04.180 --> 48:07.380
 but I keep doing it because I'm addicted to it.

48:07.380 --> 48:09.940
 And they say, we want something different,

48:09.940 --> 48:11.380
 but we don't know what.

48:11.380 --> 48:15.300
 It feels like just different.

48:15.300 --> 48:17.740
 It feels like there's a hunger for that,

48:17.740 --> 48:19.300
 but that's in the space of algorithms.

48:19.300 --> 48:22.020
 I wonder if it's possible to disrupt in that space.

48:22.020 --> 48:27.020
 Absolutely, I have this thesis that the worst part

48:27.860 --> 48:32.860
 about social networks is that they're, is the people.

48:33.740 --> 48:36.660
 It's a line that sounds funny, right?

48:36.660 --> 48:39.660
 Because like, that's why you call it a social network.

48:39.660 --> 48:42.420
 But what does social networks actually do for you?

48:42.420 --> 48:45.740
 Like just think, like imagine you were an alien

48:45.740 --> 48:47.460
 and you landed and someone says,

48:47.460 --> 48:49.460
 hey, there's this site, it's a social network.

48:49.460 --> 48:50.400
 We're not gonna tell you what it is,

48:50.400 --> 48:51.860
 but just what does it do?

48:51.860 --> 48:53.140
 And you have to explain it to them.

48:53.140 --> 48:54.340
 It does two things.

48:54.340 --> 48:59.020
 One is that people you know and have social ties with

49:00.220 --> 49:05.220
 distribute updates through whether it's photos or videos

49:05.940 --> 49:07.820
 about their lives so that you don't have to physically

49:07.820 --> 49:09.860
 be with them, but you can keep in touch with them.

49:09.860 --> 49:12.260
 That's one, that's like a big part of Instagram.

49:12.260 --> 49:14.020
 That's a big part of Snap.

49:14.020 --> 49:16.300
 It is not part of TikTok at all.

49:16.300 --> 49:19.700
 So there's another big part, which is there's all this

49:19.700 --> 49:22.420
 content out in the world that's entertaining,

49:22.420 --> 49:25.140
 whether you wanna watch it or you wanna read it.

49:26.860 --> 49:30.340
 And matchmaking between content that exists in the world

49:30.340 --> 49:33.460
 and people that want that content

49:33.460 --> 49:35.980
 turns out to be like a really big business, right?

49:35.980 --> 49:37.260
 Search and discovery, which you?

49:37.260 --> 49:39.940
 Search and discovery, but my point is it could be video,

49:39.940 --> 49:42.020
 it could be text, it could be websites, it could be,

49:42.020 --> 49:46.580
 I mean, think back to like dig, right?

49:46.580 --> 49:49.260
 Or stumble upon or, right?

49:49.260 --> 49:50.620
 Nice, yeah.

49:50.620 --> 49:51.820
 But like, what did those do?

49:51.820 --> 49:54.340
 Like they basically distributed interesting content

49:54.340 --> 49:55.460
 to you, right?

49:57.500 --> 50:00.740
 I think the most interesting part or the future

50:00.740 --> 50:03.540
 of social networks is going to be making them less social

50:03.540 --> 50:06.340
 because I think people are part of the root cause

50:06.340 --> 50:07.180
 of the problem.

50:07.180 --> 50:10.340
 So for instance, often in recommender systems,

50:10.340 --> 50:11.500
 we talk about two stages.

50:11.500 --> 50:14.500
 There's a candidate generation step, which is just like

50:14.500 --> 50:18.380
 of our vast trove of stuff that you might wanna see,

50:18.380 --> 50:23.060
 what small subset should we pick for you, okay?

50:24.020 --> 50:25.900
 Typically that is grabbed from things

50:25.900 --> 50:28.380
 your friends have shared, right?

50:28.380 --> 50:30.820
 Then there's a ranking step which says, okay,

50:30.820 --> 50:33.580
 now given these 100, 200 things depends on the network,

50:33.580 --> 50:34.420
 right?

50:34.420 --> 50:36.460
 Let's like be really good about ranking them

50:36.460 --> 50:38.940
 and generally rank the things up higher

50:38.940 --> 50:40.820
 that get the most engagement, right?

50:40.820 --> 50:42.540
 So what's the problem with that?

50:42.540 --> 50:46.860
 Step one is we've limited everything you could possibly see

50:46.860 --> 50:49.540
 to things that your friends have chosen to share

50:49.540 --> 50:52.300
 or maybe not friends, but influencers.

50:52.300 --> 50:54.580
 What things do people generally want to share?

50:54.580 --> 50:56.340
 They wanna share things that are gonna get likes,

50:56.340 --> 50:58.660
 that are gonna show up broadly.

50:58.660 --> 51:00.740
 So they tend to be more emotionally driven.

51:00.740 --> 51:03.820
 They tend to be more risque or whatever.

51:03.820 --> 51:05.140
 So why do we have this problem?

51:05.140 --> 51:08.980
 It's because we show people things people have decided

51:08.980 --> 51:11.660
 to share and those things self select to being the things

51:11.660 --> 51:14.060
 that are most divisive.

51:14.060 --> 51:15.540
 So how do you fix that?

51:15.540 --> 51:20.140
 Well, what if you just imagine for a second

51:20.140 --> 51:21.620
 that why do you have to grab things

51:21.620 --> 51:23.140
 from things your friends have shared?

51:23.140 --> 51:25.420
 Why not just like grab things?

51:25.420 --> 51:27.420
 That's really fascinating to me.

51:27.420 --> 51:29.100
 And that's something I've been thinking a lot about.

51:29.100 --> 51:34.100
 And just like, why is it that when you log onto Twitter,

51:34.940 --> 51:38.940
 you're just sitting there looking at things from accounts

51:38.940 --> 51:40.980
 that you've followed for whatever reason?

51:42.300 --> 51:44.460
 And TikTok I think has done a wonderful job here,

51:44.460 --> 51:47.180
 which is like, you can literally be anyone.

51:47.180 --> 51:51.700
 And if you produce something fascinating, it'll go viral.

51:51.700 --> 51:54.780
 But like, you don't have to be someone that anyone knows.

51:54.780 --> 51:57.300
 You don't have to have built up a giant following.

51:57.300 --> 52:00.060
 You don't have to have paid for followers.

52:00.060 --> 52:01.860
 You don't have to try to maintain those followers.

52:01.860 --> 52:04.620
 You literally just have to produce something interesting.

52:04.620 --> 52:07.260
 That is I think the future of social networking.

52:07.260 --> 52:10.020
 That's the direction things will head.

52:10.020 --> 52:12.540
 And I think what you'll find is it's far less

52:12.540 --> 52:15.860
 about people manipulating distribution

52:15.860 --> 52:18.780
 and far more about what is like, is this content good?

52:19.660 --> 52:22.420
 And good is obviously a vague definition

52:22.420 --> 52:23.700
 that we could spend hours on.

52:23.700 --> 52:27.140
 But different networks I think will decide

52:27.140 --> 52:29.300
 different value functions to decide what is good

52:29.300 --> 52:30.140
 and what isn't good.

52:30.140 --> 52:32.100
 And I think that's a fascinating direction.

52:32.100 --> 52:33.620
 So that's almost like creating an internet.

52:33.620 --> 52:36.180
 I mean, that's what Google did for web pages

52:36.180 --> 52:39.380
 that did page rank search.

52:39.380 --> 52:42.660
 So it's discovery, you don't follow anybody on Google

52:42.660 --> 52:44.380
 when you use a search engine.

52:44.380 --> 52:46.260
 You just discover web pages.

52:46.260 --> 52:49.780
 And so what TikTok does is saying,

52:49.780 --> 52:51.740
 let's start from scratch.

52:51.740 --> 52:54.540
 Let's like start a new internet

52:54.540 --> 52:56.820
 and have people discover stuff on that new internet

52:56.820 --> 52:59.820
 within a particular kind of pool of people.

52:59.820 --> 53:01.300
 But what's so fascinating about this

53:01.300 --> 53:05.140
 is like the field of information retrieval.

53:05.140 --> 53:08.460
 Like I always talked about as I was studying this stuff,

53:08.460 --> 53:10.500
 it was used the word query and document.

53:10.500 --> 53:12.860
 So I was like, why are they saying query and documents?

53:12.860 --> 53:14.660
 Like they're literally imagine,

53:14.660 --> 53:17.060
 like if you just stop thinking about query

53:17.060 --> 53:18.900
 as like literally a search query

53:18.900 --> 53:20.460
 and a query could be a person.

53:20.460 --> 53:22.100
 I mean, a lot of the way,

53:22.100 --> 53:24.220
 I'm not gonna claim to know how Instagram or Facebook

53:24.220 --> 53:26.140
 machine learning works today,

53:26.140 --> 53:30.300
 but if you want to find a match for a query,

53:30.300 --> 53:33.260
 the query is actually the attributes of the person,

53:33.260 --> 53:36.740
 their age, their gender, where they're from,

53:36.740 --> 53:39.740
 maybe some kind of summarization of their interests.

53:39.740 --> 53:41.980
 And that's a query, right?

53:41.980 --> 53:43.460
 And that matches against documents.

53:43.460 --> 53:45.100
 And by the way, documents don't have to be texts.

53:45.100 --> 53:48.180
 They can be videos, however long.

53:48.180 --> 53:50.140
 I don't know what the limit is on TikTok these days.

53:50.140 --> 53:51.340
 They keep changing it.

53:51.340 --> 53:53.380
 My point is just, you've got a query,

53:53.380 --> 53:55.260
 which is someone in search of something

53:55.260 --> 53:58.260
 that they want to match and you've got the document

53:58.260 --> 53:59.460
 and it doesn't have to be text.

53:59.460 --> 54:00.700
 It could be anything.

54:00.700 --> 54:02.060
 And how do you match make?

54:02.060 --> 54:03.220
 And that's one of these like,

54:03.220 --> 54:06.220
 I mean, I've spent a lot of time thinking about this

54:06.220 --> 54:08.820
 and I don't claim to have mastered it at all,

54:08.820 --> 54:11.700
 but I think it's so fascinating about where that will go

54:11.700 --> 54:13.300
 with new social networks.

54:13.300 --> 54:16.060
 See, what I'm also fascinated by is metrics

54:16.060 --> 54:18.140
 that are different than engagement.

54:18.140 --> 54:20.900
 So the other thing from an alien perspective,

54:20.900 --> 54:23.820
 what social networks are doing is they,

54:25.420 --> 54:26.780
 they in the short term,

54:26.780 --> 54:30.100
 bring out different aspects of each human being.

54:30.100 --> 54:38.580
 So first, let me say that an algorithm or a social network

54:38.580 --> 54:41.780
 for each individual can bring out the best of that person

54:41.780 --> 54:43.380
 or the worst of that person,

54:43.380 --> 54:45.620
 or there's a bunch of different parts to us,

54:45.620 --> 54:48.780
 parts we're proud of that we are,

54:48.780 --> 54:50.780
 parts we're not so proud of.

54:50.780 --> 54:53.100
 When we look at the big picture of our lives,

54:53.100 --> 54:55.140
 when we look back 30 days from now,

54:55.140 --> 54:57.580
 am I proud that I said those things or not?

54:57.580 --> 54:59.260
 Am I proud that I felt those things?

54:59.260 --> 55:02.820
 Am I proud that I experienced or read those things

55:02.820 --> 55:04.780
 or thought about those things?

55:04.780 --> 55:08.060
 Just in that kind of self reflected kind of way.

55:08.060 --> 55:10.180
 And so coupled with that,

55:10.180 --> 55:12.220
 I wonder if it's possible to have different metrics

55:12.220 --> 55:14.100
 that are not just about engagement,

55:14.100 --> 55:18.860
 but are about long term happiness,

55:18.860 --> 55:20.260
 growth of a human being,

55:20.260 --> 55:22.220
 where they look back and say,

55:22.220 --> 55:23.700
 I am a better human being

55:23.700 --> 55:26.860
 for having spent 100 hours on that app.

55:26.860 --> 55:30.580
 And that feels like it's actually strongly correlated

55:30.580 --> 55:33.300
 with engagement in the long term.

55:33.300 --> 55:34.740
 In the short term, it may not be,

55:34.740 --> 55:37.820
 but in long term, it's like the same kind of thing

55:37.820 --> 55:40.580
 where you really fall in love with the product.

55:40.580 --> 55:41.980
 You fall in love with an iPhone,

55:41.980 --> 55:43.780
 you fall in love with a car.

55:43.780 --> 55:45.060
 That's what makes you fall in love

55:45.060 --> 55:49.260
 is like really being proud

55:49.260 --> 55:51.580
 and just in a self reflected way,

55:51.580 --> 55:53.620
 understanding that you're a better human being

55:53.620 --> 55:55.020
 for having used the thing.

55:55.020 --> 55:58.780
 And that's what great relationships are made from.

55:58.780 --> 56:01.660
 It's not just like you're hot

56:01.660 --> 56:04.340
 and we like being together or something like that.

56:04.340 --> 56:06.100
 It's more like I'm a better human being

56:06.100 --> 56:07.620
 because I'm with you.

56:07.620 --> 56:09.300
 And that feels like a metric

56:09.300 --> 56:12.180
 that could be optimized for by the algorithms.

56:13.060 --> 56:17.140
 But anytime I kind of talk about this with anybody,

56:17.140 --> 56:18.620
 they seem to say, yeah, okay,

56:18.620 --> 56:21.060
 that's going to get out competed immediately

56:21.060 --> 56:24.700
 by the engagement if it's ad driven especially.

56:24.700 --> 56:26.540
 I just don't think so.

56:26.540 --> 56:30.700
 I don't, I mean, a lot of it's just implementation.

56:30.700 --> 56:31.660
 I'll say a couple of things.

56:31.660 --> 56:36.660
 One is to pull back the curtain on daily meetings

56:36.900 --> 56:39.220
 inside of these large social media companies.

56:40.380 --> 56:42.900
 A lot of what management,

56:42.900 --> 56:45.700
 or at least the people that are tweaking these algorithms

56:45.700 --> 56:47.900
 spend their time on are trade offs.

56:47.900 --> 56:50.100
 And there's these things called value functions,

56:50.100 --> 56:51.940
 which are like, okay,

56:51.940 --> 56:54.780
 we can predict the probability that you'll click

56:54.780 --> 56:58.260
 on this thing or the probability that you'll share it,

56:58.260 --> 57:01.180
 or the probability that you will leave a comment on it

57:01.180 --> 57:03.540
 or the probability you'll dwell on it.

57:04.660 --> 57:06.340
 Individual actions, right?

57:07.300 --> 57:09.460
 And you've got this neural network

57:09.460 --> 57:11.420
 that basically has a bunch of heads at the end

57:11.420 --> 57:14.900
 and all of them are between zero and one and great.

57:14.900 --> 57:15.980
 They all have values, right?

57:15.980 --> 57:18.260
 Or they all have probabilities.

57:19.780 --> 57:21.580
 And then in these meetings, what they will do is say,

57:21.580 --> 57:26.580
 well, how much do we value a comment versus a click

57:26.780 --> 57:29.180
 versus a share versus a,

57:29.180 --> 57:31.940
 and then maybe even some downstream thing, right?

57:31.940 --> 57:34.100
 That has nothing to do with the item there,

57:34.100 --> 57:37.540
 but like driving follows or something.

57:37.540 --> 57:40.180
 And what typically happens is they will say,

57:40.180 --> 57:42.740
 well, what are our goals for this quarter at the company?

57:42.740 --> 57:44.740
 Oh, we wanna drive sharing up, okay.

57:44.740 --> 57:46.780
 Well, let's turn down these metrics

57:46.780 --> 57:48.660
 and turn up these metrics.

57:48.660 --> 57:52.380
 And they blend them right into a single scalar

57:52.380 --> 57:53.980
 which they're trying to optimize.

57:55.260 --> 57:58.140
 That is really hard because invariably

57:58.140 --> 57:59.860
 you think you're solving for, I don't know,

57:59.860 --> 58:02.780
 something called meaningful interactions, right?

58:02.780 --> 58:04.180
 This was the big Facebook pivot.

58:04.180 --> 58:06.700
 And I don't actually have any internal knowledge.

58:06.700 --> 58:09.060
 Like I wasn't in those meetings,

58:09.060 --> 58:12.900
 but at least from what we've seen over the last month or so,

58:12.900 --> 58:16.460
 it seems by actually trying to optimize

58:16.460 --> 58:18.140
 for meaningful interactions,

58:18.140 --> 58:20.100
 it had all these side effects of optimizing

58:20.100 --> 58:22.100
 for these other things.

58:22.100 --> 58:24.580
 And I don't claim to fully understand them,

58:24.580 --> 58:28.780
 but what I will say is that trade offs abound.

58:28.780 --> 58:31.740
 And as much as you'd like to solve for one thing,

58:31.740 --> 58:34.700
 if you have a network of over a billion people,

58:34.700 --> 58:36.700
 you're gonna have unintended consequences either way.

58:36.700 --> 58:38.860
 And it gets really hard.

58:38.860 --> 58:41.420
 So what you're describing is effectively a value model

58:41.420 --> 58:43.420
 that says like, can we capture,

58:43.420 --> 58:45.620
 this is the thing that I spent a lot of time thinking about,

58:45.620 --> 58:48.660
 like, can you capture utility

58:49.940 --> 58:53.580
 in a way that like actually measures someone's happiness

58:53.580 --> 58:56.660
 that isn't just a, what do they call it?

58:56.660 --> 58:59.100
 A surrogate problem where you say, well,

58:59.100 --> 59:01.900
 kind of think like the more you use the product,

59:01.900 --> 59:03.060
 the happier you are.

59:03.060 --> 59:04.780
 That was always the argument at Facebook, by the way.

59:04.780 --> 59:07.500
 It was like, well, people use it more,

59:07.500 --> 59:09.300
 so they must be more happy.

59:09.300 --> 59:11.140
 Turns out there are like a lot of things you use more

59:11.140 --> 59:12.900
 that make you less happy in the world.

59:12.900 --> 59:14.100
 Not talking about Facebook,

59:14.100 --> 59:17.660
 just let's think about whether it's gambling or whatever,

59:17.660 --> 59:19.060
 like that you can do more of,

59:19.060 --> 59:20.740
 but doesn't necessarily make you happier.

59:20.740 --> 59:22.780
 So the idea that time equals happiness,

59:22.780 --> 59:27.060
 obviously you can't map utility and time together easily.

59:27.060 --> 59:28.820
 There are a lot of edge cases.

59:28.820 --> 59:30.460
 So when you look around the world and you say,

59:30.460 --> 59:32.700
 well, what are all the ways we can model utility?

59:32.700 --> 59:34.380
 That is like one of the,

59:34.380 --> 59:36.260
 please, if you know someone smart doing this,

59:36.260 --> 59:38.500
 introduce me because I'm fascinated by it.

59:38.500 --> 59:40.580
 And it seems really tough.

59:40.580 --> 59:42.740
 But the idea that reinforcement learning,

59:42.740 --> 59:46.460
 like everyone interesting I know in machine learning,

59:46.460 --> 59:48.820
 like I was really interested in recommender systems

59:48.820 --> 59:49.820
 and supervised learning.

59:49.820 --> 59:52.700
 And the more I dug into it, I was like,

59:52.700 --> 59:54.460
 oh, literally everyone smart

59:54.460 --> 59:56.460
 is working on reinforcement learning.

59:56.460 --> 59:57.700
 Like literally everyone.

59:57.700 --> 1:00:00.820
 You just made people at OpenAI and DeepMind very happy, yes.

1:00:00.820 --> 1:00:02.660
 But I mean, but what's interesting is like,

1:00:02.660 --> 1:00:06.660
 it's one thing to train a game and like,

1:00:06.660 --> 1:00:09.220
 I mean that paper where they just took Atari

1:00:09.220 --> 1:00:12.020
 and they used a ConvNet to basically just like

1:00:12.020 --> 1:00:15.100
 train simple actions, mind blowing, right?

1:00:15.100 --> 1:00:17.780
 Absolutely mind blowing, but it's a game, great.

1:00:18.780 --> 1:00:23.620
 So now what if you're constructing a feed for a person,

1:00:23.620 --> 1:00:24.460
 right?

1:00:24.460 --> 1:00:29.460
 Like how can you construct that feed in such a way

1:00:29.580 --> 1:00:32.380
 that optimizes for a diversity of experience,

1:00:32.380 --> 1:00:35.860
 a longterm happiness, right?

1:00:36.860 --> 1:00:38.420
 But that reward function,

1:00:38.420 --> 1:00:41.180
 it turns out in reinforcement learning again,

1:00:41.180 --> 1:00:45.220
 as I've learned, like reward design is really hard.

1:00:45.220 --> 1:00:49.740
 And I don't know, like how do you design a scalar reward

1:00:49.740 --> 1:00:51.340
 for someone's happiness over time?

1:00:51.340 --> 1:00:53.300
 I mean, do you have to measure dopamine levels?

1:00:53.300 --> 1:00:54.140
 Like, do you have to?

1:00:54.140 --> 1:00:58.020
 Well, you have to have a lot more signals

1:00:58.020 --> 1:00:59.500
 from the human being.

1:00:59.500 --> 1:01:01.700
 Currently it feels like there's not enough signals

1:01:01.700 --> 1:01:06.140
 coming from the human being users of this algorithm.

1:01:06.140 --> 1:01:08.780
 So for reinforcement learning to work well,

1:01:08.780 --> 1:01:10.860
 you need to have a lot more data.

1:01:10.860 --> 1:01:11.980
 Needs to have a lot of data.

1:01:11.980 --> 1:01:13.420
 And that actually is a challenge for anyone

1:01:13.420 --> 1:01:14.500
 who wants to start something,

1:01:14.500 --> 1:01:16.460
 which is you don't have a lot of data.

1:01:16.460 --> 1:01:17.500
 So how do you compete?

1:01:17.500 --> 1:01:20.020
 But I do think back to your original point,

1:01:20.020 --> 1:01:23.420
 rethinking the algorithm, rethinking reward functions,

1:01:23.420 --> 1:01:28.060
 rethinking utility, that's fascinating.

1:01:28.060 --> 1:01:28.900
 That's cool.

1:01:28.900 --> 1:01:31.060
 And I think that's an open opportunity

1:01:31.060 --> 1:01:33.580
 for a company that figures it out.

1:01:34.540 --> 1:01:37.420
 I have to ask about April, 2012,

1:01:37.420 --> 1:01:42.420
 when Instagram, along with its massive employee base

1:01:43.220 --> 1:01:46.820
 of 13 people was sold to Facebook for $1 billion.

1:01:48.020 --> 1:01:50.220
 What was the process like on a business level,

1:01:50.220 --> 1:01:52.140
 engineering level, human level?

1:01:52.140 --> 1:01:54.940
 What was that process of selling to Facebook like?

1:01:54.940 --> 1:01:56.460
 What did it feel like?

1:01:56.460 --> 1:01:58.100
 So I want to provide some context,

1:01:58.100 --> 1:02:00.900
 which is I worked in corporate development at Google,

1:02:00.900 --> 1:02:02.660
 which not a lot of people know,

1:02:02.660 --> 1:02:04.500
 but corporate development is effectively the group

1:02:04.500 --> 1:02:06.220
 that buys companies, right?

1:02:06.220 --> 1:02:08.140
 You sit there and you acquire companies.

1:02:08.140 --> 1:02:10.940
 And I had sat through so many of these meetings

1:02:10.940 --> 1:02:12.100
 with entrepreneurs.

1:02:12.100 --> 1:02:14.540
 We actually, fun fact, we never acquired a single company

1:02:14.540 --> 1:02:15.740
 when I worked in corporate development.

1:02:15.740 --> 1:02:19.580
 So I can't claim that I had like a lot of experience,

1:02:21.140 --> 1:02:23.420
 but I had enough experience to understand,

1:02:23.420 --> 1:02:25.580
 okay, like what prices are people getting

1:02:25.580 --> 1:02:27.340
 and what's the process?

1:02:27.340 --> 1:02:30.420
 And as we started to grow,

1:02:32.260 --> 1:02:33.980
 we were trying to keep this thing running

1:02:33.980 --> 1:02:36.220
 and we were exhausted and we were 13 people.

1:02:36.220 --> 1:02:38.820
 And I mean, we were trying to think back,

1:02:38.820 --> 1:02:42.420
 it was probably 27, 37 now,

1:02:43.700 --> 1:02:48.380
 so young on a relative basis, right?

1:02:48.380 --> 1:02:50.540
 And we're trying to keep the thing running.

1:02:50.540 --> 1:02:53.020
 And then we go out to raise money

1:02:53.020 --> 1:02:57.420
 and we're kind of like the hot startup at the time.

1:02:57.420 --> 1:03:00.460
 And I remember going into a specific VC and saying,

1:03:00.460 --> 1:03:02.340
 our terms we're looking for are,

1:03:02.340 --> 1:03:04.580
 we're looking for a $500 million valuation.

1:03:05.460 --> 1:03:10.260
 And I've never seen so many jaws drop all in unison, right?

1:03:10.260 --> 1:03:12.340
 And I was like, thanked and walked out the door

1:03:12.340 --> 1:03:14.300
 very kindly after.

1:03:14.300 --> 1:03:16.660
 And then I got a call the next day

1:03:16.660 --> 1:03:18.660
 from someone who was connected to them.

1:03:18.660 --> 1:03:21.220
 And they said, we just wanna let you know

1:03:21.220 --> 1:03:22.900
 that like it was pretty offensive

1:03:22.900 --> 1:03:25.060
 that you asked for a $500 million valuation.

1:03:25.060 --> 1:03:30.060
 And I can't tell if that was like just negotiating or what,

1:03:30.060 --> 1:03:32.580
 but it's true, like no one offered us more, right?

1:03:32.580 --> 1:03:33.420
 So we were...

1:03:33.420 --> 1:03:35.740
 So can you clarify the number again?

1:03:35.740 --> 1:03:37.100
 You said how many million?

1:03:37.100 --> 1:03:37.940
 500.

1:03:37.940 --> 1:03:38.780
 500 million.

1:03:38.780 --> 1:03:40.540
 500 million, yeah, half a billion.

1:03:42.420 --> 1:03:44.140
 So in my mind, I'm anchored like, okay,

1:03:44.140 --> 1:03:46.660
 well, literally no one's biting at 500 million.

1:03:46.660 --> 1:03:50.100
 And eventually we would get Sequoia and Greylock

1:03:50.100 --> 1:03:54.100
 and others together at 500 million, basically, post.

1:03:54.100 --> 1:03:56.940
 It was 450 pre, I think we raised $50 million.

1:03:56.940 --> 1:03:59.140
 But just like no one was used to seeing

1:03:59.140 --> 1:04:01.620
 a $500 million companies then.

1:04:01.620 --> 1:04:03.980
 Like, I don't know if it was because we were just coming

1:04:03.980 --> 1:04:06.860
 out of the hangover of 2008

1:04:06.860 --> 1:04:10.500
 and things were still on recovery mode.

1:04:10.500 --> 1:04:13.300
 But then along comes Facebook.

1:04:13.300 --> 1:04:18.300
 And after some negotiation, we've two X to the number

1:04:18.300 --> 1:04:21.020
 from a half a billion to a billion.

1:04:21.020 --> 1:04:22.860
 Yeah, it seems pretty good.

1:04:22.860 --> 1:04:27.300
 And I think Mark and I really saw eye to eye

1:04:27.300 --> 1:04:29.100
 that this thing could be big.

1:04:29.100 --> 1:04:30.220
 We thought we could...

1:04:30.220 --> 1:04:32.620
 Their resources would help us scale it.

1:04:32.620 --> 1:04:34.900
 And in a lot of ways it de risks.

1:04:34.900 --> 1:04:37.100
 I mean, it de risks a lot of the employees lives

1:04:37.100 --> 1:04:38.420
 for the rest of their lives,

1:04:38.420 --> 1:04:40.420
 including me, including Mike, right?

1:04:41.620 --> 1:04:42.900
 I think I might've had like 10 grand

1:04:42.900 --> 1:04:44.740
 in my bank account at the time, right?

1:04:44.740 --> 1:04:48.380
 Like we're working hard, we had nothing.

1:04:48.380 --> 1:04:51.340
 So on a relative basis, it seems very high.

1:04:51.340 --> 1:04:53.940
 And then I think the last company to exit

1:04:53.940 --> 1:04:55.900
 for anywhere close to a billion was YouTube

1:04:55.900 --> 1:04:56.980
 that I could think of.

1:04:57.900 --> 1:05:02.420
 And thus began the giant long bull run of 2012

1:05:02.420 --> 1:05:04.540
 to all the way to where we are now,

1:05:04.540 --> 1:05:06.940
 where I saw some stat yesterday

1:05:06.940 --> 1:05:11.060
 about like how many unicorns exist and it's absurd.

1:05:11.060 --> 1:05:13.500
 But then again, never underestimate technology

1:05:13.500 --> 1:05:15.740
 and like the value it can provide.

1:05:15.740 --> 1:05:19.060
 And man, costs have dropped and man scale has increased.

1:05:19.060 --> 1:05:23.180
 And you can make businesses make a lot of money now.

1:05:23.180 --> 1:05:26.300
 But on a fundamental level, I don't know,

1:05:26.300 --> 1:05:29.100
 like how do you describe the decision

1:05:29.100 --> 1:05:32.460
 to sell a company with 13 people for a billion dollars?

1:05:32.460 --> 1:05:36.420
 So first of all, like how did it take a lot of guts

1:05:36.420 --> 1:05:38.860
 to sit at a table and say 500 million

1:05:38.860 --> 1:05:41.660
 or 1 billion with Mark Zuckerberg?

1:05:41.660 --> 1:05:44.220
 It seems like a very large number with 13.

1:05:44.220 --> 1:05:45.580
 Like, especially...

1:05:45.580 --> 1:05:47.180
 It doesn't seem, it is.

1:05:47.180 --> 1:05:48.020
 It is.

1:05:48.020 --> 1:05:49.140
 They're all large numbers.

1:05:49.140 --> 1:05:54.140
 Especially like you said before the unicorn parade.

1:05:55.620 --> 1:05:56.860
 I like that, I'm gonna use that.

1:05:56.860 --> 1:05:57.980
 The unicorn parade?

1:05:57.980 --> 1:05:58.820
 Yeah.

1:05:59.700 --> 1:06:01.660
 You were at the head of the unicorn parade.

1:06:01.660 --> 1:06:04.900
 It's the, yeah, it's a massive unicorn parade.

1:06:04.900 --> 1:06:09.900
 Okay, so no, I mean, we knew we were worth

1:06:10.140 --> 1:06:12.340
 quote unquote a lot, but we didn't,

1:06:12.340 --> 1:06:14.580
 I mean, there was no market for Instagram.

1:06:14.580 --> 1:06:17.140
 I mean, it's not, you couldn't mark to market this thing

1:06:17.140 --> 1:06:18.060
 in the public markets.

1:06:18.060 --> 1:06:20.940
 You didn't quite understand what it would be worth

1:06:20.940 --> 1:06:23.020
 or was worth at the time.

1:06:23.020 --> 1:06:24.700
 So in a market, an illiquid market

1:06:24.700 --> 1:06:26.340
 where you have one buyer and one seller

1:06:26.340 --> 1:06:27.620
 and you're going back and forth,

1:06:27.620 --> 1:06:31.340
 and well, I guess there were like VC firms

1:06:31.340 --> 1:06:34.860
 who were willing to invest at a certain valuation.

1:06:34.860 --> 1:06:38.460
 So I don't know, you just go with your gut.

1:06:38.460 --> 1:06:41.540
 And at the end of the day, I would say

1:06:41.540 --> 1:06:46.540
 the hardest part of it was not realizing,

1:06:50.060 --> 1:06:52.140
 like when we sold, it was tough

1:06:52.140 --> 1:06:54.900
 because like literally everywhere I go,

1:06:54.900 --> 1:06:59.220
 restaurants, whatever, like for a good six months after,

1:06:59.220 --> 1:07:01.060
 there was a lot of attention on the deal,

1:07:01.060 --> 1:07:03.100
 a lot of attention on the product,

1:07:03.100 --> 1:07:06.380
 a lot of attention, it was kind of miserable, right?

1:07:06.380 --> 1:07:08.140
 And you're like, wait, like I made a lot of money,

1:07:08.140 --> 1:07:10.220
 but like, why is this not great?

1:07:10.220 --> 1:07:11.940
 And it's because it turns out,

1:07:14.060 --> 1:07:16.260
 I don't know, like I don't really keep in touch with Mark,

1:07:16.260 --> 1:07:17.940
 but I've got to assume his job right now

1:07:17.940 --> 1:07:19.980
 is not exactly the most happy job in the world.

1:07:19.980 --> 1:07:21.740
 It's really tough when you're on top

1:07:21.740 --> 1:07:24.420
 and it's really tough when you're in the limelight.

1:07:24.420 --> 1:07:27.500
 So the decision itself was like, oh, cool, this is great.

1:07:27.500 --> 1:07:29.260
 How lucky are we, right?

1:07:29.260 --> 1:07:30.620
 So, okay, there's a million question I want to ask.

1:07:30.620 --> 1:07:32.020
 Yeah, go, go, go.

1:07:32.020 --> 1:07:37.020
 First of all, why is it hard to be on top?

1:07:37.500 --> 1:07:39.340
 Why did you not feel good?

1:07:39.340 --> 1:07:40.700
 Like, can you dig into that?

1:07:40.700 --> 1:07:45.020
 It always, I've heard like Olympic athletes say

1:07:45.020 --> 1:07:48.220
 after they win gold, they get depressed.

1:07:49.340 --> 1:07:52.860
 Is it something like that where it feels like

1:07:53.860 --> 1:07:56.340
 it was kind of like a thing you were working towards?

1:07:56.340 --> 1:07:57.180
 Yeah, sure.

1:07:57.180 --> 1:07:58.860
 Some loose definition of success.

1:07:58.860 --> 1:08:00.500
 And this sure as heck feels like

1:08:01.740 --> 1:08:03.460
 at least according to other startups,

1:08:03.460 --> 1:08:04.860
 this is what success looks like.

1:08:04.860 --> 1:08:08.420
 And now why don't I feel any better?

1:08:08.420 --> 1:08:10.540
 I'm still human, I still have all the same problems.

1:08:10.540 --> 1:08:11.740
 Is that the nature?

1:08:11.740 --> 1:08:14.380
 Or is it just like negative attention of some kind?

1:08:14.380 --> 1:08:16.020
 I think it's all of the above.

1:08:16.020 --> 1:08:18.540
 But to be clear, there was a lot of happiness

1:08:18.540 --> 1:08:20.780
 in terms of like, oh my God, this is great.

1:08:20.780 --> 1:08:25.660
 Like we won the Super Bowl of startups, right?

1:08:25.660 --> 1:08:28.700
 Anyone who can get to a liquidity event

1:08:28.700 --> 1:08:31.020
 of anything meaningful feels like,

1:08:31.020 --> 1:08:32.860
 wow, this is what we started out to do.

1:08:32.860 --> 1:08:35.100
 Of course we want to create great things that people love,

1:08:35.100 --> 1:08:38.580
 but like we won in a big way.

1:08:38.580 --> 1:08:39.980
 But yeah, there's this big like,

1:08:39.980 --> 1:08:43.860
 oh, if we won, what's next?

1:08:43.860 --> 1:08:46.900
 So they call it the we have arrived syndrome,

1:08:49.180 --> 1:08:52.660
 which I need to go back and look where I can quote that from.

1:08:52.660 --> 1:08:54.140
 But I remember reading about it at the time.

1:08:54.140 --> 1:08:56.060
 I was like, oh yeah, that's that.

1:08:56.060 --> 1:08:59.220
 And I remember we had a product manager leave very early on

1:08:59.220 --> 1:09:00.340
 when we got to Facebook.

1:09:00.340 --> 1:09:01.940
 And he said to me,

1:09:01.940 --> 1:09:03.740
 I just don't believe I can learn anything

1:09:03.740 --> 1:09:05.100
 at this company anymore.

1:09:05.100 --> 1:09:08.180
 It's like, it's hit its apex.

1:09:08.180 --> 1:09:09.900
 We sold it great.

1:09:09.900 --> 1:09:12.380
 I just don't have anything else to learn.

1:09:12.380 --> 1:09:15.940
 So from 2012 all the way to the day I left in 2018,

1:09:15.940 --> 1:09:18.940
 like the amount I learned and the humility

1:09:18.940 --> 1:09:22.420
 with which I realized, oh, we thought we won.

1:09:22.420 --> 1:09:23.500
 Billion dollars is cool,

1:09:23.500 --> 1:09:26.140
 but like there are a hundred billion dollar companies.

1:09:26.140 --> 1:09:29.580
 And by the way, on top of that, we had no revenue.

1:09:29.580 --> 1:09:31.260
 We had, I mean, we had a cool product,

1:09:31.260 --> 1:09:32.660
 but we didn't scale it yet.

1:09:32.660 --> 1:09:34.900
 And there's so much to learn.

1:09:34.900 --> 1:09:38.340
 And then competitors and how fun was it to fight Snapchat?

1:09:38.340 --> 1:09:39.180
 Oh my God.

1:09:39.180 --> 1:09:42.020
 Like it was, it's like Yankees Red Sox.

1:09:42.020 --> 1:09:42.900
 It's great.

1:09:42.900 --> 1:09:44.600
 Like that's what you live for.

1:09:46.060 --> 1:09:47.900
 You know, you win some, you lose some,

1:09:47.900 --> 1:09:51.680
 but the amount you can learn through that process,

1:09:52.700 --> 1:09:56.860
 what I've realized in life is that there is no,

1:09:56.860 --> 1:09:58.620
 and there's always someone who has more,

1:09:58.620 --> 1:10:02.260
 there's always more challenge, just at different scales.

1:10:02.260 --> 1:10:04.940
 And it sounds like a little Buddhist,

1:10:04.940 --> 1:10:09.680
 but everything is super challenging,

1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:11.100
 whether you're like a small business

1:10:11.100 --> 1:10:13.100
 or an enormous business.

1:10:13.100 --> 1:10:17.100
 I say like choose the game you like to play, right?

1:10:17.100 --> 1:10:18.060
 You've got to imagine that

1:10:18.060 --> 1:10:19.660
 if you're an amazing basketball player,

1:10:19.660 --> 1:10:22.900
 you enjoy to some extent practicing basketball.

1:10:22.900 --> 1:10:24.020
 It's gotta be something you love.

1:10:24.020 --> 1:10:24.860
 It's gonna suck.

1:10:24.860 --> 1:10:26.300
 It's gonna be hard.

1:10:26.300 --> 1:10:27.460
 You're gonna have injuries, right?

1:10:27.460 --> 1:10:28.460
 But you gotta love it.

1:10:28.460 --> 1:10:30.460
 And the same thing with Instagram,

1:10:30.460 --> 1:10:35.020
 which is we might've sold, but it was like, great.

1:10:35.020 --> 1:10:37.220
 There's one Super Bowl title.

1:10:37.220 --> 1:10:38.660
 Can we win five?

1:10:38.660 --> 1:10:40.180
 What else can we do?

1:10:40.180 --> 1:10:43.500
 Now I imagine you didn't ask this, but okay, so I left.

1:10:43.500 --> 1:10:46.920
 There's a little bit of like, what do you do next, right?

1:10:46.920 --> 1:10:49.220
 Like, how do you top that thing?

1:10:49.220 --> 1:10:50.660
 It's the wrong question.

1:10:50.660 --> 1:10:53.080
 The question is like, when you wake up every day,

1:10:53.080 --> 1:10:54.900
 what is the hardest, most interesting thing

1:10:54.900 --> 1:10:56.500
 you can go work on?

1:10:56.500 --> 1:10:58.180
 Because like at the end of the day,

1:10:58.180 --> 1:11:00.780
 we all turn into dirt, it doesn't matter, right?

1:11:00.780 --> 1:11:02.540
 But what does matter is like,

1:11:02.540 --> 1:11:05.420
 can we really enjoy this life?

1:11:05.420 --> 1:11:08.540
 Not in a hedonistic way, because that's those,

1:11:08.540 --> 1:11:09.780
 it's like the reinforcement learning,

1:11:09.780 --> 1:11:12.860
 learning like short term versus long term objectives.

1:11:13.820 --> 1:11:17.500
 Can you wake up every day and truly enjoy what you're doing

1:11:19.420 --> 1:11:21.220
 knowing that it's gonna be painful?

1:11:22.240 --> 1:11:24.060
 Knowing that like, no matter what you choose,

1:11:24.060 --> 1:11:25.500
 it's gonna be painful.

1:11:25.500 --> 1:11:26.940
 Whether you sit on a beach

1:11:26.940 --> 1:11:29.980
 or whether you manage a thousand people or 10,000,

1:11:29.980 --> 1:11:31.300
 it's gonna be painful.

1:11:31.300 --> 1:11:34.300
 So choose something that's fun to have pain.

1:11:35.180 --> 1:11:38.540
 But yes, there was a lot of, we have arrived

1:11:38.540 --> 1:11:43.540
 and it's a maturation process you just have to go through.

1:11:44.420 --> 1:11:47.060
 So no matter how much success there is,

1:11:47.060 --> 1:11:48.100
 how much money you make,

1:11:48.100 --> 1:11:51.300
 you have to wake up the next day and choose the hard life,

1:11:51.300 --> 1:11:53.780
 whatever that means next, that's fun.

1:11:53.780 --> 1:11:56.680
 The fun slash hard life, hard life that's fun.

1:11:56.680 --> 1:12:00.420
 I guess what I'm trying to say is slightly different,

1:12:00.420 --> 1:12:02.980
 which is just that no one realizes

1:12:02.980 --> 1:12:05.380
 everything's gonna be hard.

1:12:05.380 --> 1:12:07.780
 Even chilling out is hard.

1:12:07.780 --> 1:12:09.980
 And then you just start worrying about stupid stuff.

1:12:09.980 --> 1:12:12.780
 Like, I don't know, like did so and so

1:12:12.780 --> 1:12:14.420
 forget to paint the house today

1:12:14.420 --> 1:12:16.260
 or like did the gardener come or whatever?

1:12:16.260 --> 1:12:18.400
 Like, or, oh, I'm so angry

1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:20.160
 and my shipment of wine didn't show up

1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:22.180
 and I'm sitting here on the beach without my wine.

1:12:22.180 --> 1:12:24.160
 I don't know, I'm making shit up now, but like.

1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:27.060
 It turns out that even chilling, AKA meditation,

1:12:27.060 --> 1:12:27.900
 is hard work.

1:12:27.900 --> 1:12:31.020
 Yeah, and at least meditation is like productive chilling

1:12:31.020 --> 1:12:32.600
 where you're like actually training yourself

1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:36.280
 to calm down and be, but backing up for a moment,

1:12:36.280 --> 1:12:37.340
 everything's hard.

1:12:37.340 --> 1:12:41.100
 You might as well be like playing the game you love to play.

1:12:41.100 --> 1:12:46.100
 I just like playing and winning and I'm on the,

1:12:47.500 --> 1:12:49.780
 I'm still on the, I think the first half of life,

1:12:49.780 --> 1:12:53.300
 knock on wood, and I've got a lot of years

1:12:53.300 --> 1:12:54.740
 and what am I gonna do, sit around?

1:12:54.740 --> 1:12:57.240
 And the other way of looking at this, by the way,

1:12:59.740 --> 1:13:02.420
 imagine you made one movie and it was great.

1:13:02.420 --> 1:13:05.140
 Would you just like stop making movies?

1:13:05.140 --> 1:13:06.960
 No, generally you're like, wow,

1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:09.380
 I really like making movies, let's make another one.

1:13:09.380 --> 1:13:10.380
 A lot of times, by the way,

1:13:10.380 --> 1:13:11.980
 the second one or the third one, not that great,

1:13:11.980 --> 1:13:13.980
 but the fourth one, awesome.

1:13:13.980 --> 1:13:15.180
 And no one forgets the second,

1:13:15.180 --> 1:13:17.580
 or everyone forgets the second and the third one.

1:13:17.580 --> 1:13:20.740
 So there's just this constant process of like,

1:13:20.740 --> 1:13:23.740
 can I produce and is that fun?

1:13:23.740 --> 1:13:24.580
 Is that exciting?

1:13:24.580 --> 1:13:25.400
 What else can I learn?

1:13:25.400 --> 1:13:26.860
 So this machine learning stuff for me

1:13:26.860 --> 1:13:30.660
 has been this awesome new chapter of being like,

1:13:31.740 --> 1:13:33.680
 man, that's something I didn't understand at all.

1:13:33.680 --> 1:13:37.220
 And now I feel like I'm one 10th of the way there.

1:13:37.220 --> 1:13:39.380
 And that feels like a big mountain to climb.

1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:42.660
 So I distracted us from the original question.

1:13:42.660 --> 1:13:44.580
 No, and we'll return to the machine learning

1:13:44.580 --> 1:13:46.560
 cause I'd love to explore your interest there.

1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:50.100
 But I mean, speaking of sort of challenges and hard things,

1:13:50.100 --> 1:13:51.740
 is there a possible world

1:13:52.740 --> 1:13:56.180
 where sitting in a room with Mark Zuckerberg

1:13:56.180 --> 1:14:00.040
 with a $1 billion deal, you turn it down?

1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:01.180
 Yeah, of course.

1:14:01.180 --> 1:14:03.260
 What does that world look like?

1:14:03.260 --> 1:14:04.660
 Why would you turn it down?

1:14:04.660 --> 1:14:05.660
 Why did you take it?

1:14:05.660 --> 1:14:08.500
 What was the calculation that you were making?

1:14:08.500 --> 1:14:11.540
 Thus enters the world of counterfactuals

1:14:11.540 --> 1:14:13.220
 and not really knowing.

1:14:13.220 --> 1:14:15.020
 And if only we could run that experiment.

1:14:15.020 --> 1:14:16.500
 Well, the universe exists,

1:14:16.500 --> 1:14:18.700
 it's just running in parallel to our own.

1:14:18.700 --> 1:14:21.060
 Yeah, it's so fascinating, right?

1:14:23.140 --> 1:14:24.780
 I mean, we're talking a lot about money,

1:14:24.780 --> 1:14:26.440
 but the real question was,

1:14:28.980 --> 1:14:30.540
 I'm not sure you'll believe me when I say this,

1:14:30.540 --> 1:14:33.700
 but could we strap our little company

1:14:33.700 --> 1:14:36.140
 onto the side of a rocket ship

1:14:36.140 --> 1:14:39.560
 and like get out to a lot of people really, really quickly

1:14:39.560 --> 1:14:44.560
 with the support, with the talent of a place like Facebook?

1:14:45.220 --> 1:14:48.220
 I mean, people often ask me what I would do differently

1:14:48.220 --> 1:14:49.060
 at Instagram today.

1:14:49.060 --> 1:14:51.220
 And I say, well, I'd probably hire more carefully

1:14:51.220 --> 1:14:53.740
 because we showed up just like before I knew it,

1:14:53.740 --> 1:14:56.380
 we had like a hundred people on the team

1:14:56.380 --> 1:14:57.780
 and 200, then 300.

1:14:57.780 --> 1:14:59.560
 I don't know where all these people were coming from.

1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:00.780
 I never had to recruit them.

1:15:00.780 --> 1:15:02.380
 I never had to screen them.

1:15:02.380 --> 1:15:05.100
 They were just like internal transfers, right?

1:15:05.100 --> 1:15:07.460
 So it's like relying on the Facebook hiring machine,

1:15:07.460 --> 1:15:11.780
 which is quite sort of, I mean, it's an elaborate machine.

1:15:11.780 --> 1:15:12.740
 It's great, by the way.

1:15:12.740 --> 1:15:15.260
 They have really talented people there.

1:15:15.260 --> 1:15:20.260
 But my point is the choice was like, take this thing,

1:15:21.420 --> 1:15:22.900
 put it on the side of a rocket ship

1:15:22.900 --> 1:15:24.940
 that you know is growing very quickly.

1:15:25.820 --> 1:15:27.240
 Like I had seen what had happened

1:15:27.240 --> 1:15:30.860
 when Ev sold Blogger to Google and then Google went public.

1:15:30.860 --> 1:15:34.580
 Remember we sold before Facebook went public.

1:15:34.580 --> 1:15:37.660
 There was a moment at which the stock price was $17,

1:15:37.660 --> 1:15:40.180
 by the way, Facebook stock price was $17.

1:15:40.180 --> 1:15:43.340
 I remember thinking, what the fuck did I just do, right?

1:15:43.340 --> 1:15:48.220
 Now at 320 ish, I don't know where we are today.

1:15:48.220 --> 1:15:52.940
 But like, okay, like the best thing by the way

1:15:52.940 --> 1:15:56.780
 is like when the stock is down, everyone calls you a dope.

1:15:56.780 --> 1:15:58.660
 And then when it's up, they also call you a dope,

1:15:58.660 --> 1:16:01.480
 but just for a different reason, right?

1:16:01.480 --> 1:16:02.540
 Like you can't win.

1:16:02.540 --> 1:16:03.860
 Less than in there somewhere.

1:16:03.860 --> 1:16:04.700
 Yeah.

1:16:04.700 --> 1:16:06.700
 So, but you know, the choice is to strap yourself

1:16:06.700 --> 1:16:08.660
 to a rocket ship or to build your own.

1:16:08.660 --> 1:16:11.100
 You know, Mr. Elon built his own

1:16:11.100 --> 1:16:13.700
 literally with a rocket ship.

1:16:13.700 --> 1:16:18.380
 That's a difficult choice because there's a world.

1:16:18.380 --> 1:16:19.820
 Actually, I would say something different,

1:16:19.820 --> 1:16:23.260
 which is Elon and others decided to sell PayPal

1:16:23.260 --> 1:16:25.140
 for not that much.

1:16:25.140 --> 1:16:26.920
 I mean, how much was it about a billion dollars?

1:16:26.920 --> 1:16:27.760
 I can't remember.

1:16:27.760 --> 1:16:28.580
 Something like that, yeah.

1:16:28.580 --> 1:16:30.260
 I mean, it was early and,

1:16:30.260 --> 1:16:31.580
 but it's worth a lot more now.

1:16:31.580 --> 1:16:33.160
 To then build a new rocket ship.

1:16:33.160 --> 1:16:34.820
 So this is the cool part, right?

1:16:34.820 --> 1:16:37.340
 If you are an entrepreneur

1:16:37.340 --> 1:16:40.460
 and you own a controlling stake in the company,

1:16:40.460 --> 1:16:42.740
 not only is it really hard to do something else

1:16:42.740 --> 1:16:45.660
 with your life because all of the, you know,

1:16:45.660 --> 1:16:48.520
 value is tied up in you as a personality

1:16:48.520 --> 1:16:50.960
 attached to this company, right?

1:16:50.960 --> 1:16:53.740
 But if you sell it and you're getting yourself enough capital

1:16:53.740 --> 1:16:55.880
 and you like have enough energy,

1:16:55.880 --> 1:16:58.020
 you can do another thing or 10 other things

1:16:58.020 --> 1:17:00.020
 or in Elon's case, like a bunch of other things.

1:17:00.020 --> 1:17:02.060
 I don't know, like I lost count at this point.

1:17:03.380 --> 1:17:05.580
 And it might've seemed silly at the time.

1:17:05.580 --> 1:17:07.300
 And sure, like if you look back,

1:17:07.300 --> 1:17:10.500
 man, PayPal is worth a lot now, right?

1:17:10.500 --> 1:17:11.340
 But I don't know.

1:17:11.340 --> 1:17:13.940
 Like, do you think Elon like cares about like,

1:17:13.940 --> 1:17:15.260
 are we gonna buy Pinterest or not?

1:17:15.260 --> 1:17:17.540
 Like, I just, he is,

1:17:17.540 --> 1:17:20.900
 he created a massive capital

1:17:20.900 --> 1:17:23.300
 that allowed him to do what he wants to do.

1:17:23.300 --> 1:17:24.120
 And that's awesome.

1:17:24.120 --> 1:17:25.500
 That's more freeing than anything

1:17:25.500 --> 1:17:28.380
 because when you are an entrepreneur attached to a company,

1:17:28.380 --> 1:17:30.720
 you gotta stay at that company for a really long time.

1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:32.900
 It's really hard to remove yourself.

1:17:32.900 --> 1:17:34.500
 But I'm not sure how much he loved

1:17:34.500 --> 1:17:37.460
 PayPal versus SpaceX and Tesla.

1:17:37.460 --> 1:17:41.420
 I have a sense that you love Instagram.

1:17:41.420 --> 1:17:43.620
 Yeah, I loved enough to like work

1:17:43.620 --> 1:17:44.940
 for six years beyond the deal.

1:17:44.940 --> 1:17:46.700
 Which is rare, which is very rare.

1:17:46.700 --> 1:17:47.540
 You chose.

1:17:47.540 --> 1:17:48.720
 But can I tell you why?

1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:49.560
 Sure.

1:17:49.560 --> 1:17:51.180
 It's, please.

1:17:51.180 --> 1:17:55.100
 There are not a lot of companies that you can be part of

1:17:55.100 --> 1:17:57.380
 where the Pope's like,

1:17:57.380 --> 1:17:59.260
 I would like to sign up for your product.

1:17:59.260 --> 1:18:01.540
 Like I'm not a religious person at all.

1:18:01.540 --> 1:18:02.780
 I'm really not.

1:18:02.780 --> 1:18:03.620
 Yeah.

1:18:03.620 --> 1:18:05.380
 You go to the Vatican and you're like walking

1:18:05.380 --> 1:18:07.940
 among giant columns and you're hearing the music

1:18:07.940 --> 1:18:10.540
 and everything and like the Pope walks in

1:18:10.540 --> 1:18:12.620
 and he wants to press the signup button on your product.

1:18:12.620 --> 1:18:15.040
 Like it's a moment in life, okay?

1:18:15.040 --> 1:18:17.440
 No matter what your persuasion, okay?

1:18:19.380 --> 1:18:22.540
 The number of doors and experiences that that opened up

1:18:22.540 --> 1:18:23.920
 was, it was incredible.

1:18:23.920 --> 1:18:26.800
 I mean, the people I got to meet, the places I got to go,

1:18:27.820 --> 1:18:30.140
 I assume maybe like a payments company

1:18:30.140 --> 1:18:32.060
 is slightly different, right?

1:18:32.060 --> 1:18:34.780
 But that's why, like it was so fun.

1:18:34.780 --> 1:18:37.420
 And plus I truly believed we were building

1:18:37.420 --> 1:18:40.860
 such a great product and I loved, loved the game.

1:18:40.860 --> 1:18:41.980
 It wasn't about money.

1:18:41.980 --> 1:18:43.560
 It was about the game.

1:18:43.560 --> 1:18:46.840
 Do you think you had the guts to say no?

1:18:46.840 --> 1:18:49.360
 Is that, so here's, I often think about this,

1:18:49.360 --> 1:18:52.500
 like how hard is it for an entrepreneur to say no?

1:18:52.500 --> 1:18:54.900
 Because the peer pressure.

1:18:54.900 --> 1:18:57.900
 So every, like basically the sea of entrepreneurs

1:18:57.900 --> 1:18:59.740
 in Silicon Valley are gonna tell you,

1:18:59.740 --> 1:19:01.680
 I mean, this is their dream.

1:19:01.680 --> 1:19:05.200
 The thing you were sitting before is a dream.

1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:07.460
 To walk away from that is really,

1:19:07.460 --> 1:19:09.480
 it seems like nearly impossible.

1:19:11.080 --> 1:19:16.060
 Because Instagram could in 10 years be,

1:19:16.060 --> 1:19:17.420
 you could talk about Google.

1:19:17.420 --> 1:19:20.260
 You could be making self driving cars

1:19:20.260 --> 1:19:21.920
 and building rockets that go to Mars

1:19:21.920 --> 1:19:23.620
 and compete with SpaceX.

1:19:23.620 --> 1:19:24.460
 Totally.

1:19:24.460 --> 1:19:27.340
 And so that's an interesting decision to say,

1:19:28.220 --> 1:19:31.460
 am I willing to risk it?

1:19:31.460 --> 1:19:34.480
 And the reason I also say it's an interesting decision

1:19:34.480 --> 1:19:37.760
 because it feels like per our previous discussion,

1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:42.140
 if you're launching a social network company,

1:19:42.140 --> 1:19:45.260
 there's going to be that meeting, whatever that number is.

1:19:45.260 --> 1:19:48.100
 If you're successful, if you're on this rocket ship

1:19:48.100 --> 1:19:50.740
 of success, there's going to be a meeting

1:19:50.740 --> 1:19:53.740
 with one of the social media, social network companies

1:19:53.740 --> 1:19:58.280
 that wanna buy you, whether it's Facebook or Twitter,

1:19:58.280 --> 1:20:00.260
 but it could also very well be Google

1:20:00.260 --> 1:20:04.540
 who seems to have like a graveyard

1:20:04.540 --> 1:20:06.620
 of failed social networks.

1:20:06.620 --> 1:20:08.940
 And it's, I mean, I don't know.

1:20:08.940 --> 1:20:11.500
 I think about that, how difficult it is

1:20:11.500 --> 1:20:13.700
 for an entrepreneur to make that decision.

1:20:13.700 --> 1:20:15.920
 How many have successfully made that decision?

1:20:15.920 --> 1:20:18.220
 I guess, this is a big question.

1:20:18.220 --> 1:20:20.380
 It's sad to me, to be honest,

1:20:20.380 --> 1:20:21.980
 that too many make that decision,

1:20:21.980 --> 1:20:23.660
 perhaps for the wrong reason.

1:20:23.660 --> 1:20:25.540
 Sorry, when you say make the decision,

1:20:25.540 --> 1:20:26.700
 you mean to the affirmative.

1:20:26.700 --> 1:20:27.620
 To the affirmative, yeah.

1:20:27.620 --> 1:20:28.620
 Got it, yeah.

1:20:28.620 --> 1:20:31.420
 There are also companies that don't sell, right?

1:20:31.420 --> 1:20:34.860
 And take the PATH and say, we're gonna be independent.

1:20:34.860 --> 1:20:37.340
 And then you've never heard of them again.

1:20:37.340 --> 1:20:40.380
 Like I remember PATH, right?

1:20:40.380 --> 1:20:42.320
 Was one of our competitors early on.

1:20:43.340 --> 1:20:45.820
 There was a big moment when they had,

1:20:45.820 --> 1:20:46.860
 I can't remember what it was,

1:20:46.860 --> 1:20:50.780
 like $110 million offer from Google or something.

1:20:50.780 --> 1:20:52.700
 It might've been larger, I don't know.

1:20:54.260 --> 1:20:56.580
 And I remember there was like this big TechCrunch article

1:20:56.580 --> 1:20:59.700
 that was like, they turned it down after talking deeply

1:20:59.700 --> 1:21:01.800
 about their values and everything.

1:21:01.800 --> 1:21:05.760
 And I don't know the inner workings of Foursquare,

1:21:05.760 --> 1:21:09.240
 but I'm certain there were many conversations over time

1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:11.780
 where there were companies that wanted Foursquare as well.

1:21:11.780 --> 1:21:15.940
 Recently, I mean, what other companies?

1:21:15.940 --> 1:21:16.980
 There's Clubhouse, right?

1:21:16.980 --> 1:21:17.820
 Like, I don't know.

1:21:17.820 --> 1:21:20.580
 Maybe people were really interested in them too.

1:21:20.580 --> 1:21:25.580
 Like there are plenty of moments where people say no

1:21:25.580 --> 1:21:28.500
 and we just forget that those things happen.

1:21:28.500 --> 1:21:33.060
 We only focus on the ones where like they said yes

1:21:33.060 --> 1:21:36.300
 and like, wow, like what if they had stayed independent?

1:21:36.300 --> 1:21:37.140
 So I don't know.

1:21:37.140 --> 1:21:39.740
 I used to think a lot about this and now I just don't

1:21:39.740 --> 1:21:41.220
 because I'm like, whatever.

1:21:42.700 --> 1:21:44.820
 Things have gone pretty well.

1:21:44.820 --> 1:21:45.980
 I'm ready for the next game.

1:21:45.980 --> 1:21:50.780
 I mean, think about an athlete where, I don't know,

1:21:50.780 --> 1:21:53.700
 maybe they do something wrong in the World Series

1:21:53.700 --> 1:21:54.540
 or whatever.

1:21:54.540 --> 1:21:57.580
 If you let it haunt you for the rest of your career,

1:21:57.580 --> 1:22:00.380
 like why not just be like, I don't know, it was a game.

1:22:00.380 --> 1:22:02.940
 Next game, next shot, right?

1:22:02.940 --> 1:22:05.100
 And if you just move to that world,

1:22:05.100 --> 1:22:07.460
 like at least I have a next shot, right?

1:22:07.460 --> 1:22:10.740
 No, that's beautiful, but I mean, just insights

1:22:10.740 --> 1:22:12.540
 and it's funny you brought up Clubhouse.

1:22:12.540 --> 1:22:14.220
 It is very true.

1:22:14.220 --> 1:22:19.220
 It seems like Clubhouse is on the downward path

1:22:19.500 --> 1:22:23.300
 and it's very possible to see a billion plus dollar deal

1:22:23.300 --> 1:22:27.220
 at some stage, maybe like a year ago or half a year ago

1:22:27.220 --> 1:22:28.580
 from Facebook, from Google.

1:22:28.580 --> 1:22:30.780
 I think Facebook was flirting with that idea too.

1:22:30.780 --> 1:22:34.780
 And I think a lot of companies probably were.

1:22:34.780 --> 1:22:37.140
 I wish it was more public.

1:22:37.140 --> 1:22:37.980
 You know what?

1:22:37.980 --> 1:22:41.260
 There's not like a bad public story

1:22:41.260 --> 1:22:43.940
 about them making the decision to walk away.

1:22:43.940 --> 1:22:45.020
 We just don't hear about it.

1:22:45.020 --> 1:22:47.540
 And then we get to see the results of that success

1:22:47.540 --> 1:22:49.300
 or the failure, more often failure.

1:22:49.300 --> 1:22:52.420
 So a couple of things, one is,

1:22:52.420 --> 1:22:54.900
 I would not assume Clubhouse is down for the count at all.

1:22:54.900 --> 1:22:56.580
 They're young, they have plenty of money,

1:22:56.580 --> 1:22:58.580
 they're run by really smart people.

1:22:59.620 --> 1:23:02.420
 I'd give them like a very fighting chance to figure it out.

1:23:02.420 --> 1:23:04.180
 There are a lot of times when people call Twitter

1:23:04.180 --> 1:23:05.860
 down for the count and they figure it out

1:23:05.860 --> 1:23:08.340
 and they seem to be doing well, right?

1:23:08.340 --> 1:23:09.780
 So just backing up like,

1:23:09.780 --> 1:23:11.820
 and not knowing anything about their internals,

1:23:11.820 --> 1:23:15.580
 like there's a strong chance they will figure it out

1:23:15.580 --> 1:23:16.780
 and that people are just down

1:23:16.780 --> 1:23:18.500
 because they like being down about companies.

1:23:18.500 --> 1:23:20.060
 They like assuming that they're gonna fail.

1:23:20.060 --> 1:23:21.220
 So who knows, right?

1:23:21.220 --> 1:23:22.580
 But let's take the ones in the past

1:23:22.580 --> 1:23:24.740
 where like we know how it played out.

1:23:24.740 --> 1:23:25.940
 There are plenty of examples

1:23:25.940 --> 1:23:28.140
 where people have turned down big offers

1:23:28.140 --> 1:23:30.940
 and then you've just never heard from them again,

1:23:30.940 --> 1:23:32.420
 but we never focus on the companies

1:23:32.420 --> 1:23:34.660
 because you just forget that those were big.

1:23:34.660 --> 1:23:36.220
 But inside your psyche,

1:23:38.260 --> 1:23:42.220
 I think it's easy for someone with enough money

1:23:42.220 --> 1:23:45.060
 to say money doesn't matter, which I think is like,

1:23:45.060 --> 1:23:45.900
 it's bullshit.

1:23:45.900 --> 1:23:50.220
 Of course, money matters to people, but at the moment,

1:23:50.220 --> 1:23:53.100
 you just can't even grasp like the number of zeros

1:23:53.100 --> 1:23:53.940
 that you're talking about.

1:23:53.940 --> 1:23:56.660
 It just doesn't make sense, right?

1:23:56.660 --> 1:23:58.580
 So to think rationally in that moment

1:23:58.580 --> 1:24:01.380
 is not something many people are equipped to do,

1:24:01.380 --> 1:24:03.020
 especially not people

1:24:03.020 --> 1:24:05.300
 where I think we had founded the company a year earlier,

1:24:05.300 --> 1:24:07.540
 maybe two years earlier, like a year and a half,

1:24:07.540 --> 1:24:11.940
 we were 13 people, but I will say,

1:24:11.940 --> 1:24:14.460
 I still don't know if it was the right decision

1:24:14.460 --> 1:24:16.020
 because I don't have that counterfactual.

1:24:16.020 --> 1:24:17.620
 I don't know that other world.

1:24:18.620 --> 1:24:21.260
 I'm just thankful that by and large,

1:24:21.260 --> 1:24:23.780
 most people love Instagram, still do.

1:24:23.780 --> 1:24:25.540
 By and large, people are very happy

1:24:25.540 --> 1:24:28.220
 with like the time we had there

1:24:28.220 --> 1:24:29.700
 and I'm proud of what we built.

1:24:29.700 --> 1:24:31.660
 So like, I'm cool.

1:24:31.660 --> 1:24:35.620
 Like now it's next shot, right?

1:24:35.620 --> 1:24:40.380
 Well, if we could just linger on this Yankees versus Red Sox,

1:24:40.380 --> 1:24:42.460
 the fun of it, the competition over,

1:24:42.460 --> 1:24:45.380
 I would say over the space of features.

1:24:45.380 --> 1:24:49.220
 So there are a bunch of features,

1:24:49.220 --> 1:24:54.220
 like there's photos, there's one minute videos on Instagram,

1:24:54.500 --> 1:24:58.860
 there's IGTV, there's stories, there's reels, there's live.

1:24:58.860 --> 1:25:01.940
 So that sounds like it's like a long list

1:25:01.940 --> 1:25:04.340
 of too much stuff, but it's not

1:25:04.340 --> 1:25:07.540
 because it feels like they're close together,

1:25:07.540 --> 1:25:09.620
 but they're somehow, like what we're saying,

1:25:09.620 --> 1:25:10.780
 fundamentally distinct,

1:25:10.780 --> 1:25:13.340
 like each of the things I mentioned.

1:25:13.340 --> 1:25:15.940
 Maybe can you describe the philosophies,

1:25:15.940 --> 1:25:17.860
 the design philosophies behind some of these,

1:25:17.860 --> 1:25:19.580
 how you were thinking about it

1:25:19.580 --> 1:25:24.580
 during the historic war between Snapchat and Instagram

1:25:24.860 --> 1:25:25.820
 or just in general,

1:25:25.820 --> 1:25:30.100
 like this space of features that was discovered.

1:25:30.100 --> 1:25:34.340
 There's this great book by Clay Christensen

1:25:34.340 --> 1:25:36.260
 called, Competing Against Luck.

1:25:36.260 --> 1:25:39.260
 It's like a terrible title,

1:25:39.260 --> 1:25:43.460
 but within it, there's effectively an expression

1:25:43.460 --> 1:25:45.740
 of this thing called jobs to be done theory.

1:25:46.580 --> 1:25:48.980
 And it's unclear if like he came up with it

1:25:48.980 --> 1:25:50.020
 or some of his colleagues,

1:25:50.020 --> 1:25:52.060
 but there are a bunch of places you can find

1:25:52.060 --> 1:25:53.300
 with people claiming to have come up

1:25:53.300 --> 1:25:55.140
 with this jobs to be done theory.

1:25:55.140 --> 1:25:59.140
 But the idea is if you like zoom out

1:25:59.140 --> 1:26:00.380
 and you look at your product,

1:26:00.380 --> 1:26:04.940
 you ask yourself, why are people hiring your product?

1:26:04.940 --> 1:26:07.020
 Like imagine every product in your life

1:26:07.020 --> 1:26:10.140
 is effectively an employee, you know,

1:26:10.140 --> 1:26:11.700
 you're CEO of your life

1:26:11.700 --> 1:26:13.860
 and you hire products to be employees effectively.

1:26:13.860 --> 1:26:15.660
 They all have roles and jobs, right?

1:26:16.660 --> 1:26:18.380
 Why are you hiring a product?

1:26:18.380 --> 1:26:19.540
 Why do you want that product

1:26:19.540 --> 1:26:21.020
 to perform something in your life?

1:26:21.020 --> 1:26:22.660
 And like, what are the hidden reasons

1:26:22.660 --> 1:26:25.580
 why you're in love with this product?

1:26:26.740 --> 1:26:28.780
 Instagram was about sharing your life

1:26:28.780 --> 1:26:31.620
 with others visually, period, right?

1:26:31.620 --> 1:26:34.340
 Why? Because you feel connected with them.

1:26:34.340 --> 1:26:35.620
 You get to show off.

1:26:35.620 --> 1:26:38.900
 You get to feel good and cared about, right?

1:26:38.900 --> 1:26:43.900
 With likes and it turns out that that will,

1:26:43.900 --> 1:26:46.500
 I think forever define Instagram

1:26:46.500 --> 1:26:49.740
 and any product that serves that job

1:26:49.740 --> 1:26:52.420
 is going to do very well, okay?

1:26:52.420 --> 1:26:55.180
 Stories let's take as an example

1:26:55.180 --> 1:26:58.060
 is very much serving that job.

1:26:58.060 --> 1:27:00.940
 In fact, it serves it better than the original product

1:27:00.940 --> 1:27:04.300
 because when you're large and have an enormous audience,

1:27:04.300 --> 1:27:08.020
 you're worried about people seeing your stuff

1:27:08.020 --> 1:27:09.500
 or you're worried about being permanent

1:27:09.500 --> 1:27:11.540
 so that a college admissions person

1:27:11.540 --> 1:27:13.460
 is going to see your photo of you doing something.

1:27:13.460 --> 1:27:16.620
 And so it turns out that that is a more efficient way

1:27:16.620 --> 1:27:19.780
 of performing that job than the original product was.

1:27:19.780 --> 1:27:22.620
 The original product still has its value,

1:27:22.620 --> 1:27:24.660
 but at scale, these two things together

1:27:24.660 --> 1:27:26.380
 work really, really well.

1:27:26.380 --> 1:27:29.780
 Now, I will claim that other parts of the product

1:27:29.780 --> 1:27:32.740
 over time didn't perform that job as well.

1:27:32.740 --> 1:27:35.580
 I think IGTV probably didn't, right?

1:27:35.580 --> 1:27:38.260
 Shopping is like completely unrelated

1:27:38.260 --> 1:27:40.740
 to what I just described, but it might work.

1:27:40.740 --> 1:27:41.820
 I don't know, right?

1:27:43.060 --> 1:27:46.740
 Products I think, products that succeed

1:27:46.740 --> 1:27:49.500
 are products that all share this parent node

1:27:49.500 --> 1:27:52.060
 of like this job to be done that is in common.

1:27:52.060 --> 1:27:55.380
 And then they're just like different ways of doing it, right?

1:27:55.380 --> 1:27:57.620
 Apple, I think does a great job with this, right?

1:27:57.620 --> 1:27:59.660
 It's like managing your digital life

1:27:59.660 --> 1:28:01.900
 and all the products just work together.

1:28:01.900 --> 1:28:06.140
 They sync, they're like, it's beautiful, right?

1:28:06.140 --> 1:28:10.420
 Even if they require like silly specific cords to work,

1:28:10.420 --> 1:28:12.900
 but they're all part of a system.

1:28:12.900 --> 1:28:14.220
 It's when you leave that system

1:28:14.220 --> 1:28:15.580
 and you start doing something weird

1:28:15.580 --> 1:28:17.780
 that people start scratching their head

1:28:17.780 --> 1:28:19.260
 and I think you are less successful.

1:28:19.260 --> 1:28:20.460
 So I think one of the challenges

1:28:20.460 --> 1:28:22.460
 Facebook has had throughout its life

1:28:22.460 --> 1:28:24.580
 is that it has never fully, I think,

1:28:24.580 --> 1:28:28.100
 appreciated the job to be done of the main product.

1:28:28.100 --> 1:28:29.220
 And what it's done is said,

1:28:29.220 --> 1:28:31.420
 ooh, there's a shiny object over there.

1:28:31.420 --> 1:28:32.780
 That startup's getting some traction.

1:28:32.780 --> 1:28:34.460
 Let's go copy that thing.

1:28:34.460 --> 1:28:36.900
 And then they're confused why it doesn't work.

1:28:36.900 --> 1:28:37.940
 Like why doesn't it work?

1:28:37.940 --> 1:28:40.100
 It's because the people who show up for this

1:28:40.100 --> 1:28:42.620
 don't want that, it's different.

1:28:42.620 --> 1:28:44.300
 What's the purpose of Facebook?

1:28:44.300 --> 1:28:47.500
 So I remember I was a very early Facebook user.

1:28:47.500 --> 1:28:50.700
 The reason I was personally excited about Facebook

1:28:50.700 --> 1:28:55.580
 is because you can, first of all, use your real name.

1:28:55.580 --> 1:28:58.060
 Like I can exist in this world.

1:28:58.060 --> 1:29:00.820
 It can be like formally exist.

1:29:00.820 --> 1:29:04.780
 I like anonymity for certain things, Reddit and so on,

1:29:04.780 --> 1:29:09.260
 but I want it to also exist not anonymously

1:29:09.260 --> 1:29:12.260
 so that I can connect with other friends of mine

1:29:12.260 --> 1:29:16.020
 nonanonymously and there's a reliable way to know

1:29:16.020 --> 1:29:19.940
 that I'm real and they're real and that we're connecting.

1:29:19.940 --> 1:29:24.780
 And it's kind of like, I liked it for the reasons

1:29:24.780 --> 1:29:27.100
 that people like LinkedIn, I guess.

1:29:27.100 --> 1:29:30.900
 But like without the form, like not everybody is dressed up

1:29:30.900 --> 1:29:34.580
 and being super polite, like more like with friends.

1:29:34.580 --> 1:29:37.540
 But then it became something much bigger than that,

1:29:37.540 --> 1:29:39.300
 I suppose, there's a feed.

1:29:39.300 --> 1:29:44.300
 It became this, I mean, it became a place

1:29:44.380 --> 1:29:49.380
 to discover content, to share content

1:29:49.940 --> 1:29:53.740
 that's not just about connecting directly with friends.

1:29:53.740 --> 1:29:54.740
 I mean, it became something else.

1:29:54.740 --> 1:29:56.540
 I don't even know what it is really.

1:29:56.540 --> 1:29:58.820
 So you said Instagram is a place

1:29:58.820 --> 1:30:02.100
 where you visually share your life.

1:30:02.100 --> 1:30:03.620
 What is Facebook?

1:30:03.620 --> 1:30:06.140
 Well, let's go back to the founding of Facebook

1:30:06.140 --> 1:30:09.660
 and why it worked really well initially at Harvard

1:30:09.660 --> 1:30:12.020
 and then Dartmouth and Stanford and I can't remember,

1:30:12.020 --> 1:30:14.620
 probably MIT, there were like a handful of schools

1:30:14.620 --> 1:30:16.060
 in that first tranche, right?

1:30:17.940 --> 1:30:19.820
 It worked because there are communities

1:30:19.820 --> 1:30:23.300
 that exist in the world that want to transact.

1:30:23.300 --> 1:30:25.340
 And when I say transact, I don't mean commercially,

1:30:25.340 --> 1:30:28.380
 I just mean they want to share, they want to coordinate,

1:30:28.380 --> 1:30:32.020
 they want to communicate, they want a space for themselves.

1:30:32.020 --> 1:30:36.340
 And Facebook at its best, I think is that.

1:30:36.340 --> 1:30:39.180
 And if actually you look at the most popular products

1:30:39.180 --> 1:30:42.060
 that Facebook has built over time,

1:30:42.060 --> 1:30:45.260
 if you look at things like groups, marketplace,

1:30:45.260 --> 1:30:47.500
 groups is enormous.

1:30:47.500 --> 1:30:50.340
 And groups is effectively like everyone can found

1:30:50.340 --> 1:30:53.460
 their own little Stanford or Dartmouth or MIT, right?

1:30:53.460 --> 1:30:57.060
 And find each other and share and communicate

1:30:57.060 --> 1:31:00.340
 about something that matters deeply to them.

1:31:00.340 --> 1:31:03.860
 That is the core of what Facebook was built around.

1:31:03.860 --> 1:31:08.860
 And I think today is where it stands most strongly.

1:31:09.060 --> 1:31:09.900
 Yeah, it's brilliant.

1:31:09.900 --> 1:31:13.620
 The groups, I wish groups were done better.

1:31:13.620 --> 1:31:16.060
 It feels like it's not a first class citizen.

1:31:16.060 --> 1:31:19.780
 I know I may be saying something without much knowledge,

1:31:19.780 --> 1:31:24.020
 but it feels like it's kind of bolted on

1:31:24.020 --> 1:31:26.140
 while being used a lot.

1:31:26.140 --> 1:31:28.940
 It feels like there needs to be a little bit more structure

1:31:28.940 --> 1:31:32.820
 in terms of discovery, in terms of like.

1:31:32.820 --> 1:31:33.780
 I mean, look at Reddit.

1:31:33.780 --> 1:31:36.540
 Like Reddit is basically groups of public and open

1:31:36.540 --> 1:31:38.620
 and a little bit crazy, right?

1:31:38.620 --> 1:31:39.460
 In a good way.

1:31:40.740 --> 1:31:42.420
 But there's clear product market fit

1:31:42.420 --> 1:31:44.860
 for that specific use case.

1:31:44.860 --> 1:31:47.060
 And it doesn't have to be a college, it can be anything.

1:31:47.060 --> 1:31:48.460
 It can be a small group, a big group,

1:31:48.460 --> 1:31:50.180
 it can be group messaging.

1:31:50.180 --> 1:31:53.220
 Facebook shines, I think, when it leans into that.

1:31:53.220 --> 1:31:56.620
 I think when there are other companies

1:31:56.620 --> 1:32:00.380
 that just seem exciting and now all of a sudden

1:32:00.380 --> 1:32:02.380
 the product shifts in some fundamental way

1:32:02.380 --> 1:32:05.820
 to go try to compete with that other thing,

1:32:05.820 --> 1:32:08.260
 that's when I think consumers get confused.

1:32:09.220 --> 1:32:10.660
 Even if you can be successful,

1:32:10.660 --> 1:32:13.020
 like even if you can compete with that other company,

1:32:13.020 --> 1:32:16.220
 even if you can figure out how to bolt it on,

1:32:16.220 --> 1:32:17.980
 eventually you come back and you look at the app

1:32:17.980 --> 1:32:20.620
 and you're like, I just don't know why I opened this app.

1:32:20.620 --> 1:32:23.180
 Like why, like too many things going on.

1:32:23.180 --> 1:32:24.580
 And that was always a worry.

1:32:24.580 --> 1:32:26.220
 I mean, you listed all the things at Instagram

1:32:26.220 --> 1:32:27.580
 and it almost gave me a heart attack,

1:32:27.580 --> 1:32:30.460
 like way too many things.

1:32:30.460 --> 1:32:31.900
 But I don't know, entrepreneurs get bored.

1:32:31.900 --> 1:32:32.900
 They want to add things.

1:32:32.900 --> 1:32:34.100
 They want to like, right?

1:32:35.980 --> 1:32:37.300
 I don't have a good answer for it,

1:32:37.300 --> 1:32:41.500
 except for that I think being true to your original use case

1:32:41.500 --> 1:32:43.060
 and not even original use case,

1:32:43.060 --> 1:32:46.260
 but sorry, actually not use case, original job.

1:32:46.260 --> 1:32:49.340
 There are many use cases under that job.

1:32:49.340 --> 1:32:52.220
 Being true to that and like being really good at it

1:32:52.220 --> 1:32:56.100
 over time and morphing as needs change,

1:32:57.180 --> 1:32:59.540
 I think that's how to make a company last forever.

1:32:59.540 --> 1:33:03.860
 And I mean, honestly, like my main thesis

1:33:03.860 --> 1:33:07.540
 about why Facebook is in the position it is today

1:33:07.540 --> 1:33:12.540
 is if they have had a series of product launches

1:33:12.540 --> 1:33:16.340
 that delighted people over time,

1:33:16.340 --> 1:33:17.980
 I think they'd be in a totally different world.

1:33:17.980 --> 1:33:20.420
 So just like imagine for a moment,

1:33:20.420 --> 1:33:21.780
 and by the way, Apple's entering this,

1:33:21.780 --> 1:33:23.860
 but like Apple for so long,

1:33:23.860 --> 1:33:25.300
 just like product after product,

1:33:25.300 --> 1:33:26.620
 you couldn't wait for it.

1:33:26.620 --> 1:33:27.900
 You stood in line for it.

1:33:27.900 --> 1:33:28.740
 You talked about it.

1:33:28.740 --> 1:33:29.940
 You got excited.

1:33:29.940 --> 1:33:31.780
 Amazon makes your life so easy.

1:33:31.780 --> 1:33:34.260
 It's like, wow, I needed this thing

1:33:34.260 --> 1:33:36.180
 and it showed up at my door two days later.

1:33:36.180 --> 1:33:39.180
 And like both of these companies, by the way,

1:33:39.180 --> 1:33:41.220
 Amazon, Apple have issues, right?

1:33:41.220 --> 1:33:43.260
 There are labor issues,

1:33:43.260 --> 1:33:45.380
 whether it's here in the US or in China,

1:33:45.380 --> 1:33:48.380
 there are environmental issues.

1:33:48.380 --> 1:33:49.620
 But like when's the last time

1:33:49.620 --> 1:33:52.820
 you heard like a large chorus being like,

1:33:52.820 --> 1:33:54.020
 these companies better pay

1:33:54.020 --> 1:33:56.220
 for what they're doing on these things, right?

1:33:56.220 --> 1:33:59.940
 I think Facebook's main issue today is like,

1:33:59.940 --> 1:34:01.740
 you need to produce a hit.

1:34:01.740 --> 1:34:03.780
 If you don't produce hits,

1:34:03.780 --> 1:34:06.460
 it's really hard to keep consumers on your side.

1:34:06.460 --> 1:34:08.300
 Then people just start picking on you

1:34:08.300 --> 1:34:11.300
 for a variety of reasons, whether it's right or wrong.

1:34:11.300 --> 1:34:12.580
 I'm not even going to place a judgment

1:34:12.580 --> 1:34:13.420
 right here and right now.

1:34:13.420 --> 1:34:17.140
 I'm just going to say that it is way better

1:34:17.140 --> 1:34:19.180
 to be in a world where you are producing hits

1:34:19.180 --> 1:34:21.900
 and consumers love what you're doing

1:34:21.900 --> 1:34:23.460
 because then they're on your side.

1:34:23.460 --> 1:34:26.580
 And I think that's, it's the past 10 years

1:34:26.580 --> 1:34:29.900
 for Facebook has been fairly hard on this dimension.

1:34:29.900 --> 1:34:33.020
 So, and by hits, it doesn't necessarily mean financial hits.

1:34:33.020 --> 1:34:34.620
 It feels like to me, what you're saying

1:34:34.620 --> 1:34:37.300
 is something that brings joy.

1:34:37.300 --> 1:34:38.380
 A product that brings joy

1:34:38.380 --> 1:34:40.100
 to some fraction of the population.

1:34:40.100 --> 1:34:44.460
 Yeah, I mean, TikTok isn't just literally an algorithm.

1:34:45.460 --> 1:34:49.460
 In some ways, TikTok's content and algorithm

1:34:49.460 --> 1:34:53.420
 have more sway now over the American psyche

1:34:53.420 --> 1:34:54.860
 than Facebook's algorithm, right?

1:34:54.860 --> 1:34:57.220
 It's visual, it's video.

1:34:57.220 --> 1:34:59.500
 By the way, it's not defined by who you follow.

1:34:59.500 --> 1:35:01.340
 It's defined by some magical thing that,

1:35:01.340 --> 1:35:02.700
 by the way, if someone wanted to tweak

1:35:02.700 --> 1:35:05.540
 to show you a certain type of content for some reason,

1:35:05.540 --> 1:35:09.820
 they could, right, but people love it.

1:35:10.780 --> 1:35:13.940
 So as a CEO, let me ask you a question

1:35:13.940 --> 1:35:15.580
 because leadership matters.

1:35:17.700 --> 1:35:19.900
 This is a complicated question.

1:35:19.900 --> 1:35:23.820
 Why is Mark Zuckerberg distrusted, disliked

1:35:23.820 --> 1:35:27.060
 and sometimes even hated by many people in public?

1:35:28.220 --> 1:35:30.180
 Right, that is a complicated question.

1:35:30.180 --> 1:35:34.740
 Well, the premise, I'm not sure I agree with the premise.

1:35:34.740 --> 1:35:38.100
 And I can expand that to include

1:35:38.100 --> 1:35:42.300
 even a more mysterious question for me, Bill Gates.

1:35:42.300 --> 1:35:43.140
 Hmm.

1:35:44.780 --> 1:35:47.380
 What is the Bill Gates version of the question?

1:35:47.380 --> 1:35:49.660
 Do you think people hate Bill Gates?

1:35:49.660 --> 1:35:51.340
 No, distrust.

1:35:51.340 --> 1:35:52.300
 Ah.

1:35:52.300 --> 1:35:55.660
 So takeaway one, it's a checklist.

1:35:56.780 --> 1:36:00.300
 There is, I think Mark Zuckerberg's distrust

1:36:00.300 --> 1:36:04.220
 is the primary one, but there's also like a dislike,

1:36:04.220 --> 1:36:05.580
 maybe hate is too strong a word,

1:36:05.580 --> 1:36:09.020
 but it's just if you look at like the articles

1:36:09.020 --> 1:36:13.500
 that are being written and so on, there's a dislike.

1:36:13.500 --> 1:36:15.580
 And it makes, it's confusing to me

1:36:15.580 --> 1:36:18.540
 because it's like the public picks certain individuals

1:36:18.540 --> 1:36:21.940
 and they attach certain kinds of emotions

1:36:21.940 --> 1:36:22.940
 to those individuals.

1:36:22.940 --> 1:36:27.460
 Yeah, so someone once just recently said,

1:36:27.460 --> 1:36:30.540
 there's a strong case that founder led companies

1:36:30.540 --> 1:36:33.980
 have this problem and that a lot of Mark's issues

1:36:33.980 --> 1:36:38.380
 come today come from the fact that he is a visible founder

1:36:38.380 --> 1:36:42.940
 with this story that people have watched in both a movie

1:36:42.940 --> 1:36:45.500
 and they followed along and he's this boy wonder kid

1:36:45.500 --> 1:36:47.540
 who became one of the world's richest people

1:36:47.540 --> 1:36:50.540
 and he's no longer Mark the person,

1:36:50.540 --> 1:36:53.220
 he's Mark this image of a person

1:36:53.220 --> 1:36:55.620
 with enormous wealth and power.

1:36:55.620 --> 1:36:59.020
 And in today's world, we have issues

1:36:59.020 --> 1:37:02.260
 with enormous wealth and power for a variety of reasons.

1:37:02.260 --> 1:37:04.220
 One of which is we've been stuck inside

1:37:05.260 --> 1:37:07.380
 for a year and a half, two years.

1:37:07.380 --> 1:37:10.380
 One of which is a lot of people were really unhappy

1:37:10.380 --> 1:37:13.860
 about not the last election, but the last, last election.

1:37:13.860 --> 1:37:15.220
 And where do you take out that anger?

1:37:15.220 --> 1:37:18.380
 Who do you blame but the people in charge?

1:37:18.380 --> 1:37:21.220
 That's one example or one reason why I think

1:37:22.260 --> 1:37:26.540
 a lot of people express anger or resentment

1:37:26.540 --> 1:37:29.660
 or unhappiness with Mark.

1:37:29.660 --> 1:37:31.620
 At the same time, I don't know,

1:37:31.620 --> 1:37:34.020
 I pointed out to that person, I was like, well,

1:37:34.020 --> 1:37:37.100
 I don't know, I think a lot of people really like Elon.

1:37:38.260 --> 1:37:41.340
 Elon arguably, he kept his factory open here

1:37:41.340 --> 1:37:44.380
 throughout COVID protocols, which arguably

1:37:44.380 --> 1:37:47.180
 a lot of people would be against.

1:37:47.180 --> 1:37:50.660
 While saying a bunch of crazy offensive things

1:37:50.660 --> 1:37:52.300
 on the internet, they still.

1:37:52.300 --> 1:37:56.940
 And basically gives the middle finger to the SEC

1:37:56.940 --> 1:37:59.500
 on Twitter and I don't know, I'm like,

1:37:59.500 --> 1:38:02.900
 well, there's a founder and like people kind of like him.

1:38:02.900 --> 1:38:07.900
 So I do think that the founder and slash CEO

1:38:09.100 --> 1:38:11.660
 of a company that's a social network company

1:38:11.660 --> 1:38:13.820
 is like an extra level of difficulty.

1:38:13.820 --> 1:38:15.420
 If life is a video game,

1:38:15.420 --> 1:38:17.700
 you just chose the harder video game.

1:38:17.700 --> 1:38:20.100
 So, I mean, that's why it's interesting to ask you

1:38:20.100 --> 1:38:24.780
 because you were the founder and CEO of a social network.

1:38:24.780 --> 1:38:25.860
 I challenge it because.

1:38:25.860 --> 1:38:30.780
 Exactly, but you're one of the rare examples.

1:38:30.780 --> 1:38:34.500
 Even Jack Dorsey's disliked, not to the degree,

1:38:34.500 --> 1:38:35.860
 but it just seems harder

1:38:35.860 --> 1:38:38.900
 when you're running a social media company.

1:38:38.900 --> 1:38:39.740
 It's interesting.

1:38:39.740 --> 1:38:41.380
 I never thought of Jack as just like,

1:38:41.380 --> 1:38:43.980
 I think generally he's well respected.

1:38:45.100 --> 1:38:45.940
 Yeah, I think so.

1:38:45.940 --> 1:38:50.540
 I think you're right, but he's not loved.

1:38:50.540 --> 1:38:51.380
 Yeah.

1:38:51.380 --> 1:38:53.260
 And I feel like you, I mean, to me,

1:38:53.260 --> 1:38:54.860
 Twitter is an incredible thing.

1:38:54.860 --> 1:38:57.500
 Yeah, again, can I just come back to this point,

1:38:57.500 --> 1:38:59.180
 which seems over simplistic,

1:38:59.180 --> 1:39:04.180
 but I really do think how a product makes someone feel,

1:39:04.940 --> 1:39:07.420
 they ascribe that feeling to the founder.

1:39:07.420 --> 1:39:08.260
 Yep.

1:39:09.900 --> 1:39:11.860
 So make people feel good.

1:39:11.860 --> 1:39:13.020
 So think about it.

1:39:13.020 --> 1:39:14.860
 Let's just go with this thesis for a second.

1:39:14.860 --> 1:39:16.060
 Sure, I like it though.

1:39:17.140 --> 1:39:19.580
 Amazon's pretty utilitarian, right?

1:39:19.580 --> 1:39:21.540
 It delivers brown boxes to your front door.

1:39:21.540 --> 1:39:23.420
 Sure, you can have Alexa

1:39:23.420 --> 1:39:25.540
 and you can have all these things, right?

1:39:25.540 --> 1:39:28.980
 But in general, it delivers stuff quickly to you

1:39:28.980 --> 1:39:30.580
 at a reasonable price, right?

1:39:31.460 --> 1:39:34.220
 I think Jeff Bezos is wonderfully wealthy,

1:39:34.220 --> 1:39:36.660
 thoughtful, smart guy, right?

1:39:36.660 --> 1:39:38.820
 But people kind of feel that way about him.

1:39:38.820 --> 1:39:40.300
 They're like, wow, this is really big.

1:39:40.300 --> 1:39:42.820
 We're impressed that this is really big.

1:39:42.820 --> 1:39:45.820
 But he's doing the same space stuff Elon's doing,

1:39:45.820 --> 1:39:47.220
 but they don't necessarily ascribe

1:39:47.220 --> 1:39:50.060
 the same sense of wonder, right?

1:39:50.060 --> 1:39:51.300
 Now let's take Elon.

1:39:51.300 --> 1:39:52.860
 And again, this is pet theory.

1:39:52.860 --> 1:39:55.460
 I don't have much proof other than my own intuition.

1:39:56.460 --> 1:39:59.740
 He is literally about living the future.

1:39:59.740 --> 1:40:01.980
 Mars, it's about wonder.

1:40:01.980 --> 1:40:04.060
 It's about going back to that feeling as a kid

1:40:04.060 --> 1:40:05.900
 when you looked up to the stars and asked,

1:40:05.900 --> 1:40:08.140
 is there life out there?

1:40:08.140 --> 1:40:11.060
 People get behind that because it's a sense of hope

1:40:11.060 --> 1:40:13.460
 and excitement and innovation.

1:40:13.460 --> 1:40:15.340
 And like, you can say whatever you want,

1:40:15.340 --> 1:40:18.860
 but we ascribe that emotion to that person.

1:40:18.860 --> 1:40:21.140
 Now, let's say you're on a social network

1:40:21.140 --> 1:40:23.220
 and people make you kind of angry

1:40:23.220 --> 1:40:24.380
 because they disagree with you

1:40:24.380 --> 1:40:25.820
 or they say something ridiculous

1:40:25.820 --> 1:40:28.580
 or they're living a FOMO type life where you're like,

1:40:28.580 --> 1:40:30.340
 wow, I wish I was doing that thing.

1:40:31.780 --> 1:40:33.980
 I think Instagram, if I were to think back,

1:40:33.980 --> 1:40:35.900
 by and large, when I was there,

1:40:35.900 --> 1:40:39.780
 was not about FOMO, was not about this influencer economy,

1:40:39.780 --> 1:40:43.540
 although it certainly became that way closer to the end.

1:40:43.540 --> 1:40:45.820
 It was about the sense of wonder and happiness

1:40:45.820 --> 1:40:47.220
 and beautiful things in the world.

1:40:47.220 --> 1:40:49.380
 And I don't know, I mean, like,

1:40:49.380 --> 1:40:50.540
 I don't want to have a blind spot,

1:40:50.540 --> 1:40:52.500
 but I don't think anyone had a strong opinion

1:40:52.500 --> 1:40:53.620
 about me one way or the other.

1:40:53.620 --> 1:40:55.660
 For the longest time, the way people explained to me,

1:40:55.660 --> 1:40:57.580
 I mean, if you want to go for toxicity,

1:40:57.580 --> 1:40:59.380
 you go to Facebook or Twitter.

1:40:59.380 --> 1:41:01.820
 If you want to go to feel good about life,

1:41:01.820 --> 1:41:04.460
 you go to Instagram to enjoy, celebrate life.

1:41:04.460 --> 1:41:05.860
 And my experience been talking to people

1:41:05.860 --> 1:41:08.340
 is they gave me the benefit of the doubt because of that.

1:41:08.340 --> 1:41:10.020
 But if your experience of the product

1:41:10.020 --> 1:41:13.660
 is kind of makes you angry, it's where you argue.

1:41:13.660 --> 1:41:15.200
 I mean, a big part of Jack might be

1:41:15.200 --> 1:41:17.780
 that he wasn't actually the CEO for a very long time

1:41:17.780 --> 1:41:19.260
 and only became recently.

1:41:19.260 --> 1:41:22.180
 So I'm not sure how much of the connection got made.

1:41:23.660 --> 1:41:26.180
 But in general, I mean, if you hate,

1:41:28.140 --> 1:41:29.620
 I'm just thinking about other companies

1:41:29.620 --> 1:41:30.720
 that aren't tech companies.

1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:32.580
 If you hate like what a company is doing

1:41:32.580 --> 1:41:35.020
 or it makes you not feel happy.

1:41:36.340 --> 1:41:37.860
 I don't know, like people are really angry

1:41:37.860 --> 1:41:39.140
 about Comcast or whatever.

1:41:39.140 --> 1:41:40.660
 Are they even called Comcast anymore?

1:41:40.660 --> 1:41:42.100
 It's like Xfinity or something, right?

1:41:42.100 --> 1:41:43.300
 They had to rebrand.

1:41:43.300 --> 1:41:44.620
 They became meta, right?

1:41:44.620 --> 1:41:48.580
 And it's like, but my point is if it makes you angry.

1:41:48.580 --> 1:41:50.020
 That's beautiful, yeah.

1:41:50.020 --> 1:41:54.940
 But the thing is, this is me saying this.

1:41:54.940 --> 1:41:58.780
 I think your thesis is very strong and correct,

1:41:58.780 --> 1:42:00.100
 has elements of correctness,

1:42:00.100 --> 1:42:05.100
 but I still personally put some blame on individuals.

1:42:05.540 --> 1:42:06.380
 Of course.

1:42:06.380 --> 1:42:10.360
 I think you said, Elon, looking up,

1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:13.500
 there's something about Childlike Wander to him,

1:42:13.500 --> 1:42:16.400
 like to his personality, his character,

1:42:16.400 --> 1:42:19.900
 something about, I think more so than others

1:42:19.900 --> 1:42:21.260
 where people can trust them.

1:42:21.260 --> 1:42:23.060
 And there's, I don't know,

1:42:23.060 --> 1:42:26.460
 Sondra Prachai is an example of somebody who's like,

1:42:26.460 --> 1:42:29.660
 there's some kind, it's hard to put into words,

1:42:29.660 --> 1:42:32.120
 but there's something about the human being

1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:34.300
 where he's trustworthy.

1:42:34.300 --> 1:42:38.260
 He's human in a way that connects to us.

1:42:38.260 --> 1:42:40.820
 And the same with Sajid Nadella.

1:42:40.820 --> 1:42:45.820
 I mean, some of these folks, something about us

1:42:46.460 --> 1:42:48.500
 is drawn to them, even when they're flawed.

1:42:48.500 --> 1:42:53.100
 Even like, so your thesis really holds up for Steve Jobs

1:42:53.100 --> 1:42:55.080
 because I think people didn't like Steve Jobs,

1:42:55.080 --> 1:42:57.460
 but he delivered products

1:42:57.460 --> 1:42:59.520
 and then they fell in love every time.

1:43:01.060 --> 1:43:03.040
 I guess you could say that the CEO,

1:43:03.040 --> 1:43:05.820
 the leader is also a product.

1:43:05.820 --> 1:43:08.980
 And if they keep delivering a product that people like

1:43:08.980 --> 1:43:11.460
 by being in public and saying things that people like,

1:43:11.460 --> 1:43:14.660
 that's also a way to make people happy.

1:43:14.660 --> 1:43:16.260
 But from a social network perspective,

1:43:16.260 --> 1:43:19.860
 it makes me wonder how difficult it is

1:43:19.860 --> 1:43:22.100
 to explain to people why certain things happen,

1:43:22.100 --> 1:43:24.500
 like to explain machine learning,

1:43:24.500 --> 1:43:27.180
 to explain why certain,

1:43:30.460 --> 1:43:32.480
 the woke mob effect happens

1:43:32.480 --> 1:43:36.420
 or the certain kinds of like bullying happens,

1:43:36.420 --> 1:43:40.780
 which is like, it's human nature combined with algorithm.

1:43:40.780 --> 1:43:42.560
 And it's very difficult to control for

1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:45.620
 how the spread of quote unquote misinformation happens.

1:43:45.620 --> 1:43:47.700
 It's very difficult to control for that.

1:43:47.700 --> 1:43:50.500
 And so you try to decelerate certain parts

1:43:50.500 --> 1:43:53.700
 and you create more problems than you solve.

1:43:53.700 --> 1:43:55.820
 And anything that looks at all like censorship

1:43:55.820 --> 1:43:58.820
 can create huge amounts of problems as a slippery slope.

1:43:58.820 --> 1:44:01.100
 And then you have to inject humans

1:44:01.100 --> 1:44:03.180
 to oversee the machine learning algorithms.

1:44:03.180 --> 1:44:05.540
 And anytime you inject humans into the system,

1:44:05.540 --> 1:44:07.220
 it's gonna create a huge number of problems.

1:44:07.220 --> 1:44:08.780
 And I feel like it's up to the leader

1:44:08.780 --> 1:44:12.780
 to communicate that effectively, to be transparent.

1:44:12.780 --> 1:44:13.960
 First of all, design products

1:44:13.960 --> 1:44:15.180
 that don't have those problems.

1:44:15.180 --> 1:44:17.500
 And second of all, when they have those problems,

1:44:17.500 --> 1:44:19.060
 to be able to communicate with them.

1:44:19.060 --> 1:44:21.100
 I guess that's all going to,

1:44:21.100 --> 1:44:25.060
 when you run a social network company, your job is hard.

1:44:25.060 --> 1:44:28.780
 Yeah, I will say the one element that you haven't named

1:44:28.780 --> 1:44:31.660
 that I think you're getting at is just bedside manner,

1:44:31.660 --> 1:44:35.460
 which Steve Jobs, I never worked for him.

1:44:35.460 --> 1:44:37.000
 I never met him in person.

1:44:38.580 --> 1:44:43.580
 Had an uncanny ability in public to have bedside manner.

1:44:43.620 --> 1:44:46.500
 I mean, some of the best clips of Steve Jobs

1:44:46.500 --> 1:44:49.500
 from like, I would say maybe the 80s

1:44:49.500 --> 1:44:51.980
 when he's on the stage and getting questions

1:44:51.980 --> 1:44:53.460
 from the audience about life.

1:44:54.460 --> 1:44:56.600
 And he'll take this question that is like,

1:44:56.600 --> 1:44:58.420
 how are you gonna compete with blah?

1:44:58.420 --> 1:44:59.460
 And it's super boring.

1:44:59.460 --> 1:45:01.480
 And I don't even know the name of the company.

1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:05.360
 And his answer is as if you just asked your grandfather,

1:45:05.360 --> 1:45:06.300
 the meaning of life.

1:45:07.420 --> 1:45:10.220
 And you sit there and you're just like, what?

1:45:10.220 --> 1:45:11.820
 And there's that bedside manner.

1:45:13.220 --> 1:45:16.980
 And if you lack that, or if that's just not intuitive to you,

1:45:16.980 --> 1:45:20.260
 I think that it can be a lot harder

1:45:20.260 --> 1:45:21.500
 to gain the trust of people.

1:45:21.500 --> 1:45:25.200
 And then add on top of that, missteps of companies.

1:45:27.320 --> 1:45:29.060
 I don't know if you have any friends from the past

1:45:29.060 --> 1:45:31.360
 where maybe they crossed you once,

1:45:31.360 --> 1:45:34.380
 or maybe you get back together and you're friends again,

1:45:34.380 --> 1:45:36.900
 but you just never really forget that thing.

1:45:36.900 --> 1:45:38.880
 It's human nature not to forget.

1:45:38.880 --> 1:45:40.700
 I'm Russian, you crossed me once.

1:45:41.780 --> 1:45:43.340
 We solved the problem.

1:45:43.340 --> 1:45:48.340
 So my point is, humans don't forget.

1:45:48.900 --> 1:45:50.380
 And if there are times in the past

1:45:50.380 --> 1:45:52.180
 where they feel like they don't trust the company

1:45:52.180 --> 1:45:54.020
 or the company hasn't had their back,

1:45:55.180 --> 1:45:57.060
 that is really hard to earn back,

1:45:57.060 --> 1:46:00.000
 especially if you don't have that bedside manner.

1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:02.900
 And again, I'm not attributing this specifically to Marc

1:46:02.900 --> 1:46:06.380
 because I think a lot of the companies have this issue

1:46:06.380 --> 1:46:10.620
 where one, you have to be trustworthy as a company

1:46:10.620 --> 1:46:12.620
 and live by it and live by those actions.

1:46:12.620 --> 1:46:14.540
 And then two, I think you need to be able

1:46:14.540 --> 1:46:18.100
 to be really relatable in a way that's very difficult

1:46:18.100 --> 1:46:20.560
 if you're worth what these people are.

1:46:20.560 --> 1:46:22.060
 It's really hard.

1:46:22.060 --> 1:46:23.220
 Yeah.

1:46:23.220 --> 1:46:27.020
 Jack does a pretty good job of this by being a monk.

1:46:27.020 --> 1:46:29.740
 But I also, Jack issues attention.

1:46:29.740 --> 1:46:32.100
 He's not out there almost on purpose.

1:46:32.100 --> 1:46:35.300
 He's just working hard, doing square, right?

1:46:35.300 --> 1:46:38.140
 I literally shared a desk like this with him at Odeo.

1:46:38.140 --> 1:46:41.220
 I mean, this normal guy who likes painting,

1:46:41.220 --> 1:46:45.000
 I remember he would leave early on Wednesdays or something

1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:47.340
 to go to a painting class.

1:46:47.340 --> 1:46:49.380
 And he's creative, he's thoughtful.

1:46:49.380 --> 1:46:53.340
 I mean, money makes people more creative and more thoughtful,

1:46:53.340 --> 1:46:55.980
 extreme versions of themselves, right?

1:46:55.980 --> 1:46:58.300
 And this was a long, long time ago.

1:46:58.300 --> 1:47:00.540
 You mentioned that he asked you

1:47:00.540 --> 1:47:02.740
 to do some kind of JavaScript thing.

1:47:02.740 --> 1:47:05.220
 We were working on some JavaScript together.

1:47:05.220 --> 1:47:08.020
 That's hilarious, like pre Twitter, early Twitter days,

1:47:08.020 --> 1:47:11.220
 you and Jack Dorsey are in a room together

1:47:11.220 --> 1:47:12.780
 talking about JavaScript,

1:47:12.780 --> 1:47:14.780
 solving some kind of menial problem.

1:47:14.780 --> 1:47:15.860
 Terrible problems, yeah.

1:47:15.860 --> 1:47:18.420
 I mean, not terrible, just like boring widget problem.

1:47:18.420 --> 1:47:19.660
 I think it was the Odeo widget

1:47:19.660 --> 1:47:21.660
 we were working on at the time.

1:47:21.660 --> 1:47:24.800
 I'm surprised anyone paid me to be in the room as an intern

1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:26.500
 because I didn't really provide any value.

1:47:26.500 --> 1:47:30.440
 I'm very thankful to anyone who included me back in the day.

1:47:30.440 --> 1:47:32.220
 It was very helpful.

1:47:32.220 --> 1:47:33.780
 So thank you for listening.

1:47:33.780 --> 1:47:37.720
 I mean, is there Odeo that's a precursor to Twitter?

1:47:38.820 --> 1:47:40.700
 First of all, did you have any anticipation

1:47:40.700 --> 1:47:43.580
 that this Jack Dorsey guy could be also

1:47:43.580 --> 1:47:46.180
 a head of a major social network?

1:47:46.180 --> 1:47:49.420
 And second, did you learn anything from the guy that,

1:47:49.420 --> 1:47:52.460
 like, do you think it's a coincidence

1:47:52.460 --> 1:47:54.380
 that you two were in the room together?

1:47:55.220 --> 1:47:58.900
 And it's the coincidence meaning like,

1:47:58.900 --> 1:48:01.700
 why does the world play its game in a certain way

1:48:01.700 --> 1:48:04.100
 where these two founders of social networks?

1:48:04.100 --> 1:48:04.940
 I don't know.

1:48:04.940 --> 1:48:05.820
 It's so weird, right?

1:48:05.820 --> 1:48:10.820
 Like, I mean, it's also weird that Mark showed up

1:48:11.900 --> 1:48:13.940
 in our fraternity my sophomore year

1:48:13.940 --> 1:48:16.340
 and we got to know each other then,

1:48:16.340 --> 1:48:18.060
 like long before Instagram.

1:48:18.060 --> 1:48:20.620
 It's a small world,

1:48:20.620 --> 1:48:23.640
 but let me tell a fun story about Jack.

1:48:25.100 --> 1:48:27.260
 We're at Odeo and I don't know,

1:48:27.260 --> 1:48:28.900
 I think Ev was feeling like people

1:48:28.900 --> 1:48:31.340
 weren't working hard enough or something.

1:48:31.340 --> 1:48:32.180
 Nice.

1:48:32.180 --> 1:48:35.100
 And I can't remember exactly what he,

1:48:35.100 --> 1:48:39.180
 he created this thing where every Friday,

1:48:39.180 --> 1:48:40.380
 I don't know if it was every Friday,

1:48:40.380 --> 1:48:43.140
 I only remember this happening once,

1:48:43.140 --> 1:48:47.540
 but he had us like a statuette, it's like of Mary.

1:48:47.540 --> 1:48:50.740
 And in the bottom, it's hollow, right?

1:48:50.740 --> 1:48:54.260
 And I remember on a Friday,

1:48:54.260 --> 1:48:57.300
 Ev decided he was going to let everyone vote for

1:48:57.300 --> 1:48:59.600
 who had worked the hardest that week.

1:48:59.600 --> 1:49:01.380
 We all voted, closed ballot, right?

1:49:01.380 --> 1:49:04.420
 We all put it in a bucket and he tallied the votes.

1:49:04.420 --> 1:49:07.820
 And then whoever got the most votes, as I recall,

1:49:07.820 --> 1:49:09.860
 got the statuette.

1:49:09.860 --> 1:49:12.280
 And in the statuette was a thousand bucks,

1:49:12.280 --> 1:49:14.380
 or I recall there was a thousand bucks in it.

1:49:14.380 --> 1:49:15.280
 It might've been a hundred bucks,

1:49:15.280 --> 1:49:16.220
 but let's call it a thousand.

1:49:16.220 --> 1:49:17.060
 It's more exciting that way.

1:49:17.060 --> 1:49:18.020
 It felt like a thousand, yeah.

1:49:18.020 --> 1:49:19.420
 It did to me for sure.

1:49:19.420 --> 1:49:20.560
 I actually got two votes.

1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:21.400
 I was very happy.

1:49:21.400 --> 1:49:23.180
 We were a small company, but as the intern,

1:49:23.180 --> 1:49:24.020
 I got at least two votes.

1:49:24.020 --> 1:49:26.260
 So everybody knew how many votes they got individually?

1:49:26.260 --> 1:49:27.100
 Yeah, yeah.

1:49:27.100 --> 1:49:29.060
 And I think it was one of these self accountability things.

1:49:29.060 --> 1:49:31.420
 Anyway, I remember Jack just getting

1:49:31.420 --> 1:49:34.180
 like the vast majority of votes from everyone.

1:49:35.100 --> 1:49:37.100
 And I remember just thinking like,

1:49:37.100 --> 1:49:39.740
 like I couldn't imagine he would become what he'd become

1:49:39.740 --> 1:49:41.140
 and do what he would do,

1:49:41.140 --> 1:49:45.640
 but I had a profound respect that the new guy

1:49:45.640 --> 1:49:48.820
 who I really liked worked that hard.

1:49:48.820 --> 1:49:51.720
 And you could see his dedication even then

1:49:51.720 --> 1:49:53.860
 and that people respected him.

1:49:53.860 --> 1:49:55.660
 That's the one story that I remember of him

1:49:55.660 --> 1:49:58.000
 like working with him specifically from that summer.

1:49:58.000 --> 1:49:59.500
 Can I take a small tangent on that?

1:49:59.500 --> 1:50:00.340
 Of course.

1:50:00.340 --> 1:50:02.020
 There's kind of a pushback in Silicon Valley

1:50:02.020 --> 1:50:04.380
 a little bit against hard work.

1:50:04.380 --> 1:50:08.380
 Can you speak to the sort of the thing you admire

1:50:08.380 --> 1:50:11.420
 to see the new guy working so hard, that thing?

1:50:11.420 --> 1:50:13.740
 What is the value of that thing in a company?

1:50:13.740 --> 1:50:16.420
 See, this is like, just to be very frank,

1:50:16.420 --> 1:50:17.720
 it drives me nuts.

1:50:17.720 --> 1:50:21.860
 Like I saw this really funny video on TikTok.

1:50:21.860 --> 1:50:22.680
 Was it on TikTok?

1:50:22.680 --> 1:50:24.940
 It was like, I'm taking a break from my mental health

1:50:24.940 --> 1:50:26.300
 to work on my career.

1:50:26.300 --> 1:50:27.460
 I thought that was funny.

1:50:27.460 --> 1:50:31.700
 Um, so I was like, oh, it is kind of phrased that way,

1:50:31.700 --> 1:50:32.980
 the opposite often, right?

1:50:32.980 --> 1:50:33.820
 Yeah.

1:50:33.820 --> 1:50:35.180
 Okay, so a couple of things.

1:50:35.180 --> 1:50:40.180
 Uh, I, uh, I have worked so hard

1:50:42.380 --> 1:50:43.680
 to do the things that I did.

1:50:43.680 --> 1:50:47.580
 Like Mike and I lost years off of our lives,

1:50:47.580 --> 1:50:50.140
 staying up late, figuring things out,

1:50:50.140 --> 1:50:51.700
 the stress that comes with the job.

1:50:51.700 --> 1:50:54.800
 I have a lot more gray hair now than I did back then.

1:50:54.800 --> 1:50:57.100
 It requires an enormous amount of work

1:50:57.100 --> 1:50:59.460
 and most people aren't successful, right?

1:50:59.460 --> 1:51:01.640
 But even the ones that do don't skate by.

1:51:04.300 --> 1:51:07.220
 I am okay if people choose not to work hard

1:51:07.220 --> 1:51:09.020
 because I don't actually think there's anything

1:51:09.020 --> 1:51:11.360
 in this world that says you have to work hard.

1:51:13.140 --> 1:51:16.420
 But I do think that great things require a lot of hard work.

1:51:16.420 --> 1:51:18.640
 So there's no way you can expect to change the world

1:51:18.640 --> 1:51:19.700
 without working really hard.

1:51:19.700 --> 1:51:22.560
 By the way, even changing the world,

1:51:22.560 --> 1:51:24.260
 you know, the folks that I respect the most

1:51:24.260 --> 1:51:27.220
 have nudged the world in like a slight direction,

1:51:27.220 --> 1:51:29.460
 slight, very, very slight.

1:51:30.840 --> 1:51:33.940
 Like even if Elon accomplishes all the things

1:51:33.940 --> 1:51:34.920
 he wants to accomplish,

1:51:34.920 --> 1:51:38.420
 we will have nudged the world in a slight direction,

1:51:38.420 --> 1:51:40.120
 but it requires enormous amount.

1:51:40.120 --> 1:51:43.140
 There was an interview with him where he was just like,

1:51:43.140 --> 1:51:45.020
 he was interviewed, I think, at the Tesla factory

1:51:45.020 --> 1:51:47.500
 and he was like, work is really hard.

1:51:47.500 --> 1:51:49.380
 This is actually unhealthy.

1:51:49.380 --> 1:51:51.220
 And I can't recall the exact,

1:51:51.220 --> 1:51:52.860
 but he was like visibly shaken

1:51:52.860 --> 1:51:54.220
 about how hard he had been working.

1:51:54.220 --> 1:51:55.860
 And he was like, this is bad.

1:51:55.860 --> 1:51:57.620
 And unfortunately, I think to have great outcomes,

1:51:57.620 --> 1:51:58.900
 you actually do need to work

1:51:58.900 --> 1:52:01.840
 at like three standard deviations above the mean,

1:52:01.840 --> 1:52:03.980
 but there's nothing saying that people have to go for that.

1:52:03.980 --> 1:52:06.420
 See, the thing is, but what I would argue,

1:52:06.420 --> 1:52:08.080
 this is my personal opinion,

1:52:08.080 --> 1:52:10.460
 is nobody has to do anything, first of all.

1:52:10.460 --> 1:52:12.340
 They certainly don't have to work hard.

1:52:12.340 --> 1:52:17.340
 But I think hard work in a company should be admired.

1:52:17.340 --> 1:52:20.340
 And you should not feel like,

1:52:22.340 --> 1:52:26.340
 you shouldn't feel good about yourself for not working hard.

1:52:26.340 --> 1:52:30.140
 Like, so for example, I don't have to work out.

1:52:30.140 --> 1:52:31.860
 I don't have to run.

1:52:31.860 --> 1:52:35.580
 I hate running, but like, I certainly don't feel good

1:52:35.580 --> 1:52:37.540
 if I don't run because I know for my health,

1:52:37.540 --> 1:52:39.020
 like there's certain values,

1:52:39.020 --> 1:52:40.340
 I guess is what I'm trying to get at.

1:52:40.340 --> 1:52:42.180
 There's certain values that you have in life.

1:52:42.180 --> 1:52:43.580
 It feels like there's certain values

1:52:43.580 --> 1:52:45.380
 that companies should have in hard work.

1:52:45.380 --> 1:52:47.700
 Certain values that companies should have in hard work

1:52:47.700 --> 1:52:51.460
 is one of the things I think that should be admired.

1:52:51.460 --> 1:52:53.680
 I often ask this kind of silly question,

1:52:54.540 --> 1:52:56.560
 just to get a sense of people,

1:52:56.560 --> 1:52:58.580
 like if I'm hiring and so on.

1:52:58.580 --> 1:53:00.860
 I just ask if they think it's better

1:53:00.860 --> 1:53:03.140
 to work hard or work smart.

1:53:03.140 --> 1:53:07.420
 It was helpful for me to get a sense of people from that.

1:53:07.420 --> 1:53:08.260
 Because you think like the right.

1:53:08.260 --> 1:53:09.740
 The answer's both.

1:53:09.740 --> 1:53:10.560
 What's that?

1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:11.400
 The answer's both.

1:53:11.400 --> 1:53:12.240
 The answer's both.

1:53:12.240 --> 1:53:13.900
 I usually try not to give them that,

1:53:13.900 --> 1:53:16.900
 but sometimes I'll say both if that's an option.

1:53:16.900 --> 1:53:19.780
 But a lot of people kind of,

1:53:19.780 --> 1:53:22.060
 a surprising number will say work smart.

1:53:22.060 --> 1:53:23.380
 And there are usually people

1:53:23.380 --> 1:53:25.840
 who don't know how to work smart.

1:53:26.700 --> 1:53:29.580
 And they're literally just lazy.

1:53:29.580 --> 1:53:32.260
 Not just, there's two effects behind that.

1:53:32.260 --> 1:53:36.420
 One is laziness and the other is ego.

1:53:37.300 --> 1:53:40.420
 When you're younger and you say it's better to work smart,

1:53:40.420 --> 1:53:44.220
 it means you think you know what it means

1:53:44.220 --> 1:53:46.820
 to work smart at this early stage.

1:53:46.820 --> 1:53:49.940
 To me, people that say work hard or both,

1:53:49.940 --> 1:53:52.360
 they have the humility to understand like,

1:53:52.360 --> 1:53:54.340
 I'm going to have to work my ass off

1:53:54.340 --> 1:53:56.820
 because I'm too dumb to know how to work smart.

1:53:56.820 --> 1:53:59.140
 And people who are self critical in this way,

1:53:59.140 --> 1:54:01.480
 in some small amount, you have to have some confidence.

1:54:01.480 --> 1:54:03.860
 But if you have humility,

1:54:03.860 --> 1:54:06.420
 that means you're going to actually eventually figure out

1:54:06.420 --> 1:54:07.500
 what it means to work smart.

1:54:07.500 --> 1:54:11.220
 And then to actually be successful, you should do both.

1:54:11.220 --> 1:54:14.060
 So I have a very particular take on this,

1:54:14.060 --> 1:54:19.060
 which is that no one's forcing you to do anything.

1:54:19.820 --> 1:54:22.260
 All choices have consequences.

1:54:22.260 --> 1:54:27.260
 So if you major in, I don't know, theoretical literature,

1:54:27.540 --> 1:54:28.900
 I don't even know if that's a major.

1:54:28.900 --> 1:54:30.020
 I'm just making something up.

1:54:30.020 --> 1:54:33.580
 That's supposed to regular literature, applied literature.

1:54:33.580 --> 1:54:38.300
 Yeah, think about like theoretical Spanish lit

1:54:38.300 --> 1:54:39.420
 from the 14th century.

1:54:39.420 --> 1:54:41.740
 Like just make up your esoteric thing.

1:54:41.740 --> 1:54:44.300
 And then the number of people I went to Stanford with

1:54:44.300 --> 1:54:45.360
 who get out in the world and they're like,

1:54:45.360 --> 1:54:47.260
 wait, what, I can't find a job?

1:54:47.260 --> 1:54:49.020
 Like no one wants a theoretical,

1:54:49.020 --> 1:54:51.660
 like there are plenty of counter examples

1:54:51.660 --> 1:54:53.380
 of people who have majored in esoteric things

1:54:53.380 --> 1:54:54.840
 and gone on to be very successful.

1:54:54.840 --> 1:54:56.700
 So I just want to be clear, it's not about the major.

1:54:56.700 --> 1:55:00.820
 But every choice you make, whether it's to have kids,

1:55:00.820 --> 1:55:02.900
 like I love my children.

1:55:02.900 --> 1:55:04.660
 It's so awesome to have two kids.

1:55:04.660 --> 1:55:08.060
 And it is so hard to work really hard and also have kids.

1:55:08.060 --> 1:55:09.420
 It's really hard.

1:55:09.420 --> 1:55:12.640
 And there's a reason why certain very successful people

1:55:12.640 --> 1:55:14.560
 like don't have, or not successful,

1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:17.460
 but people who run very, very large companies or startups

1:55:17.460 --> 1:55:19.180
 have chosen not to have kids for a while

1:55:19.180 --> 1:55:21.620
 or chosen not to like prioritize them.

1:55:21.620 --> 1:55:22.620
 Everything's a choice.

1:55:22.620 --> 1:55:24.900
 And like I choose to prioritize my children

1:55:24.900 --> 1:55:27.780
 because like I want to do that, right?

1:55:27.780 --> 1:55:29.420
 So everything's a choice.

1:55:29.420 --> 1:55:33.120
 Now, once you've made that choice,

1:55:33.120 --> 1:55:36.160
 I think it's important that the contract is clear,

1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:37.000
 which is to say,

1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:39.120
 let's imagine you were joining a new startup.

1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:43.520
 It's important that that startup communicate

1:55:43.520 --> 1:55:44.720
 that like the expectation is like,

1:55:44.720 --> 1:55:46.440
 we're all working really, really hard right now.

1:55:46.440 --> 1:55:48.760
 You don't have to join the startup.

1:55:48.760 --> 1:55:51.480
 But like, if you do just know like you're,

1:55:51.480 --> 1:55:53.720
 it's almost as if you join, I don't know,

1:55:53.720 --> 1:55:57.960
 pick your like sports team.

1:55:57.960 --> 1:56:00.840
 Like let's go back to the Yankees for a second.

1:56:00.840 --> 1:56:01.880
 You want to join the Yankees,

1:56:01.880 --> 1:56:03.640
 but you don't really want to work that hard.

1:56:03.640 --> 1:56:05.780
 You don't really want to do batting practice

1:56:05.780 --> 1:56:08.640
 or pitching practice or whatever for your position, right?

1:56:09.840 --> 1:56:11.400
 That to me is wacko.

1:56:11.400 --> 1:56:13.920
 And that's actually the world that it feels like we live in

1:56:13.920 --> 1:56:15.240
 in tech sometimes,

1:56:15.240 --> 1:56:17.080
 where people both want to work for the Yankees

1:56:17.080 --> 1:56:18.480
 because it pays a lot,

1:56:18.480 --> 1:56:21.100
 but like don't actually want to work that hard.

1:56:21.100 --> 1:56:23.300
 That I don't fully understand.

1:56:23.300 --> 1:56:26.000
 Because if you sign up for some of these things,

1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:26.840
 just sign up for it.

1:56:26.840 --> 1:56:29.020
 But it's okay if you don't want to sign up for it.

1:56:29.020 --> 1:56:31.720
 There's so many wonderful careers in this world

1:56:31.720 --> 1:56:33.780
 that don't require 80 hours a week.

1:56:33.780 --> 1:56:35.280
 But when I read about companies going to like

1:56:35.280 --> 1:56:36.520
 four day work weeks and stuff,

1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:39.800
 I just like, I chuckle because I can't get enough done

1:56:39.800 --> 1:56:41.080
 with a seven day week.

1:56:41.080 --> 1:56:42.820
 I don't know how.

1:56:42.820 --> 1:56:44.920
 And people will say, oh, you're just not working smart.

1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:46.600
 And it's like, no, I work pretty smart,

1:56:46.600 --> 1:56:47.560
 I think in general.

1:56:47.560 --> 1:56:49.340
 Like I wouldn't have gotten to this point

1:56:49.340 --> 1:56:52.760
 if I hadn't like some amount of working smart.

1:56:52.760 --> 1:56:53.840
 And there is balance though.

1:56:53.840 --> 1:56:55.880
 So I used to be like a pretty big cyclist.

1:56:55.880 --> 1:56:58.240
 I don't do it much anymore just because of kids

1:56:58.240 --> 1:57:00.280
 and like prioritizing other things, right?

1:57:01.760 --> 1:57:03.380
 But one of the most important things to learn

1:57:03.380 --> 1:57:06.140
 as a cyclist is to take a rest day.

1:57:06.140 --> 1:57:07.640
 But to me and to cyclists,

1:57:07.640 --> 1:57:12.640
 like resting is a function of optimizing for the long run.

1:57:12.680 --> 1:57:16.240
 It's not like a thing that you do for its own merits.

1:57:16.240 --> 1:57:17.880
 It's actually like, if you don't rest,

1:57:17.880 --> 1:57:18.880
 your muscles don't recover.

1:57:18.880 --> 1:57:19.880
 And then you're just not as,

1:57:19.880 --> 1:57:21.520
 like you're not training as efficiently.

1:57:21.520 --> 1:57:24.680
 You should probably, the successful people I've known

1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:27.160
 in terms of athletes, they hate rest days,

1:57:27.160 --> 1:57:29.800
 but they know they have to do it for the long term.

1:57:29.800 --> 1:57:32.560
 They think their opposition is getting stronger and stronger

1:57:32.560 --> 1:57:34.360
 and that's the feeling,

1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:36.000
 but you know it's the right thing

1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:38.200
 and usually you need a coach to help you.

1:57:38.200 --> 1:57:39.040
 Yeah, totally.

1:57:39.040 --> 1:57:41.240
 So, I mean, I use this thing called training peaks

1:57:41.240 --> 1:57:42.080
 and it's interesting

1:57:42.080 --> 1:57:44.060
 because it actually mathematically shows

1:57:44.060 --> 1:57:46.800
 like where you are on the curve and all this stuff,

1:57:46.800 --> 1:57:49.400
 but you have to have that rest,

1:57:49.400 --> 1:57:52.320
 but it's a function of going harder for longer.

1:57:52.320 --> 1:57:53.840
 Again, it's this reinforcement learning,

1:57:53.840 --> 1:57:56.480
 like planning the aggregate and the long,

1:57:56.480 --> 1:57:58.600
 but a lot of people will hide behind laziness

1:57:58.600 --> 1:58:00.880
 by saying that they're trying to optimize for the long run

1:58:00.880 --> 1:58:03.200
 and they're not, they're just not working very hard.

1:58:03.200 --> 1:58:05.040
 But again, you don't have to sign up for it.

1:58:05.040 --> 1:58:05.880
 It's totally cool.

1:58:05.880 --> 1:58:07.420
 Like, I don't think less of people

1:58:07.420 --> 1:58:08.960
 for like not working super hard.

1:58:08.960 --> 1:58:10.280
 It's just like, don't sign up for things

1:58:10.280 --> 1:58:11.880
 that require working super hard.

1:58:11.880 --> 1:58:13.920
 And some of that requires for the leadership

1:58:13.920 --> 1:58:17.080
 to have the guts, the boldness to communicate effectively

1:58:17.080 --> 1:58:17.920
 at the very beginning.

1:58:17.920 --> 1:58:20.760
 I mean, sometimes I think most of the problems arise

1:58:20.760 --> 1:58:24.600
 in the fact that the leadership is kind of hesitant

1:58:24.600 --> 1:58:29.600
 to communicate the socially difficult truth

1:58:30.960 --> 1:58:33.840
 of what it takes to be at this company.

1:58:33.840 --> 1:58:36.520
 So they kind of say, hey, come with us.

1:58:36.520 --> 1:58:39.480
 There's, we have snacks, you know, but.

1:58:39.480 --> 1:58:40.800
 Unlimited vacation and.

1:58:40.800 --> 1:58:41.640
 Yeah.

1:58:41.640 --> 1:58:44.240
 You know, Ray at Bridgewater is always fascinating

1:58:44.240 --> 1:58:45.640
 because, you know, people,

1:58:45.640 --> 1:58:47.920
 it's been called like a cult on the outside

1:58:47.920 --> 1:58:49.860
 or cultish and,

1:58:49.860 --> 1:58:51.000
 but what's fascinating is like,

1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:52.800
 they just don't give on their principles.

1:58:52.800 --> 1:58:55.240
 They're like, listen, this is what it's like to work here.

1:58:55.240 --> 1:58:57.320
 We record every meeting.

1:58:57.320 --> 1:58:59.280
 We're like brutally honest

1:58:59.280 --> 1:59:00.920
 and that's not going to feel right to everyone.

1:59:00.920 --> 1:59:03.440
 And if it doesn't feel right to you, totally cool.

1:59:03.440 --> 1:59:04.880
 Just go work somewhere else.

1:59:04.880 --> 1:59:08.040
 But if you work here, you are signing up for this.

1:59:08.040 --> 1:59:10.400
 And that's, that's been fascinating to me

1:59:10.400 --> 1:59:12.200
 because it's honesty upfront.

1:59:12.200 --> 1:59:15.480
 It's a system in which you operate.

1:59:15.480 --> 1:59:16.720
 And if it's not for you,

1:59:16.720 --> 1:59:19.600
 like no one's forcing you to work there, right?

1:59:19.600 --> 1:59:20.440
 I actually did.

1:59:20.440 --> 1:59:22.280
 So I did a conversation with him

1:59:22.280 --> 1:59:25.140
 and kind of got stuck in a funny moment,

1:59:25.140 --> 1:59:28.360
 which is at the end I asked him, you know,

1:59:28.360 --> 1:59:31.420
 to give me honest feedback of how I did on the interview.

1:59:31.420 --> 1:59:32.260
 And I was.

1:59:32.260 --> 1:59:33.440
 Did he?

1:59:33.440 --> 1:59:34.760
 I don't think so.

1:59:34.760 --> 1:59:36.200
 He was super nice.

1:59:36.200 --> 1:59:38.760
 He asked me, he's like, well,

1:59:38.760 --> 1:59:40.120
 tell me, did you accomplish

1:59:40.120 --> 1:59:42.040
 what you were hoping to accomplish?

1:59:42.040 --> 1:59:44.040
 I was like, that's not, that's not.

1:59:45.080 --> 1:59:47.880
 I'm asking you as an objective observer

1:59:47.880 --> 1:59:50.740
 of two people talking, how do we do today?

1:59:52.000 --> 1:59:53.760
 And then he's like, well,

1:59:53.760 --> 1:59:55.240
 he gave me this politician answer.

1:59:55.240 --> 1:59:57.200
 Well, I feel like we've accomplished

1:59:57.200 --> 2:00:00.280
 successful communication of like ideas,

2:00:00.280 --> 2:00:03.600
 which is I'd love to spread some of the ideas

2:00:03.600 --> 2:00:06.880
 in that, like in principles and so on.

2:00:06.880 --> 2:00:07.720
 I was like.

2:00:07.720 --> 2:00:08.760
 Back to my original point,

2:00:08.760 --> 2:00:10.000
 it's really hard to get.

2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:11.880
 Even for Radalia.

2:00:11.880 --> 2:00:13.880
 It's really hard to give feedback.

2:00:13.880 --> 2:00:15.720
 And one of the other things I learned from him

2:00:15.720 --> 2:00:18.780
 and just people in that world is like,

2:00:19.760 --> 2:00:22.120
 man, humans really like to pretend

2:00:22.120 --> 2:00:23.800
 like they've come to,

2:00:24.700 --> 2:00:27.080
 that they've come to some kind of meeting of the minds.

2:00:27.080 --> 2:00:30.120
 Like if there's conflict, if you and I have conflict,

2:00:30.120 --> 2:00:32.620
 it's always better to meet face to face, right?

2:00:32.620 --> 2:00:33.720
 We're on the phone.

2:00:33.720 --> 2:00:35.240
 Slack is not great, right?

2:00:35.240 --> 2:00:37.160
 Email is not great, but face to face.

2:00:37.160 --> 2:00:38.680
 What's crazy is you and I get together

2:00:38.680 --> 2:00:40.660
 and we actively try to,

2:00:40.660 --> 2:00:43.080
 even if we're not actually solving the conflict,

2:00:43.080 --> 2:00:45.880
 we actively try to paper over the conflict.

2:00:45.880 --> 2:00:48.620
 Oh yeah, it didn't really bother me that much.

2:00:48.620 --> 2:00:50.840
 Oh yeah, I'm sure you didn't mean it.

2:00:50.840 --> 2:00:54.320
 But like, no, in our minds we're still there.

2:00:54.320 --> 2:00:56.200
 So this is one of the things that as a leader,

2:00:56.200 --> 2:00:58.420
 you always have to be digging,

2:00:58.420 --> 2:00:59.260
 especially as you ascend.

2:00:59.260 --> 2:01:00.880
 Like straight to the conflict.

2:01:00.880 --> 2:01:02.040
 Yeah, but as you ascend,

2:01:02.040 --> 2:01:03.600
 no one wants to tell you you're crazy.

2:01:03.600 --> 2:01:06.720
 No one wants to tell you your idea is bad.

2:01:06.720 --> 2:01:08.120
 And you can, you're like, oh,

2:01:08.120 --> 2:01:09.160
 oh, I'm going to be a leader.

2:01:09.160 --> 2:01:12.280
 And the idea is, well, I'm just going to ask people.

2:01:12.280 --> 2:01:13.600
 No one tells you.

2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:16.560
 So like you have to look for the markers,

2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:18.240
 knowing that literally just people

2:01:18.240 --> 2:01:21.280
 aren't going to tell you along the way and be paranoid.

2:01:21.280 --> 2:01:24.000
 I mean, you asked about selling the company.

2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:25.960
 I think one of the biggest differences between me

2:01:25.960 --> 2:01:28.240
 and a lot of other entrepreneurs is like,

2:01:28.240 --> 2:01:30.440
 I wasn't completely confident we could do it.

2:01:30.440 --> 2:01:35.440
 Like we could be alone and actually be great.

2:01:35.920 --> 2:01:37.560
 And if any entrepreneur is honest with you,

2:01:37.560 --> 2:01:39.120
 they also feel that way.

2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:40.080
 But a lot of people are like,

2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:42.600
 well, I have to be cocky and just say,

2:01:42.600 --> 2:01:43.960
 I can do this on my own.

2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:44.800
 We're going to be fine.

2:01:44.800 --> 2:01:46.760
 We're going to crush everyone.

2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:49.160
 Some people do say that and then it's not right.

2:01:49.160 --> 2:01:50.760
 And they, and they fail.

2:01:50.760 --> 2:01:55.480
 But being honest in that moment with yourself,

2:01:55.480 --> 2:01:57.440
 with those close to you.

2:01:57.440 --> 2:02:00.840
 And also you talked about the personality of leaders

2:02:00.840 --> 2:02:02.940
 and who resonates and who doesn't.

2:02:04.320 --> 2:02:09.320
 It's rare that I see leaders be vulnerable, rare.

2:02:09.320 --> 2:02:12.500
 And one thing I tried to do at Instagram,

2:02:12.500 --> 2:02:15.820
 at least internally was like, say when I screwed up

2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:19.700
 and like point out how I was wrong about things

2:02:19.700 --> 2:02:21.660
 and point out where my judgment was off.

2:02:22.700 --> 2:02:25.360
 Everyone thinks they have to bat a thousand, right?

2:02:25.360 --> 2:02:27.060
 Like that's crazy.

2:02:27.060 --> 2:02:29.060
 The best quant hedge funds in the world,

2:02:29.060 --> 2:02:31.660
 bat 50.001%.

2:02:31.660 --> 2:02:34.020
 They just take a lot of bets, right?

2:02:34.020 --> 2:02:37.800
 Renaissance, they might, they might bat 51%, right?

2:02:37.800 --> 2:02:41.620
 But holy hell, like the question isn't,

2:02:41.620 --> 2:02:43.340
 are you right every single time

2:02:43.340 --> 2:02:45.040
 and you have to seem invincible.

2:02:46.380 --> 2:02:48.220
 The question is how many at bats do you get?

2:02:48.220 --> 2:02:53.220
 And on average, are you better on average, right?

2:02:53.700 --> 2:02:55.620
 With enough bets and enough at bats

2:02:55.620 --> 2:02:57.680
 that your aggregate can be very high.

2:02:58.700 --> 2:03:01.980
 I mean, Steve Jobs was wrong at a lot of stuff.

2:03:01.980 --> 2:03:03.780
 The Newton too early, right?

2:03:03.780 --> 2:03:05.280
 Next, not quite right.

2:03:05.280 --> 2:03:08.200
 There was even a time where he said like,

2:03:08.200 --> 2:03:13.200
 no one will ever wanna watch a video on the iPod.

2:03:13.340 --> 2:03:14.400
 Totally wrong.

2:03:14.400 --> 2:03:16.200
 But who cares if you come around

2:03:16.200 --> 2:03:18.600
 and realize your mistake and fix it.

2:03:18.600 --> 2:03:20.360
 It becomes just like you said, harder and harder

2:03:20.360 --> 2:03:23.000
 when your ego grows and the number of people around you

2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:26.240
 that say positive things towards you grows.

2:03:26.240 --> 2:03:28.560
 I actually think it's really valuable that,

2:03:29.400 --> 2:03:31.560
 like let's imagine a counterfactual

2:03:31.560 --> 2:03:34.760
 where Instagram became worth like $300 billion

2:03:34.760 --> 2:03:36.120
 or something crazy, right?

2:03:37.280 --> 2:03:40.240
 I kind of like that my life is relatively normal now.

2:03:40.240 --> 2:03:41.840
 When I say relatively, you get what I mean.

2:03:41.840 --> 2:03:44.260
 I'm not making a claim that I live a normal life,

2:03:44.260 --> 2:03:46.180
 but like I certainly don't live in a world

2:03:46.180 --> 2:03:49.460
 where there are like 15 Sherpas following me,

2:03:49.460 --> 2:03:52.600
 like fetching me water, like that's not how it works.

2:03:52.600 --> 2:03:56.540
 I actually like that I have a sense of humility of like,

2:03:56.540 --> 2:03:59.160
 I may not found another thing that's nearly as big

2:03:59.160 --> 2:04:01.140
 so I have to work twice as hard

2:04:01.140 --> 2:04:04.420
 or I have to like learn twice as much.

2:04:04.420 --> 2:04:07.320
 I have to, we haven't talked about machine learning yet,

2:04:07.320 --> 2:04:11.260
 but my favorite thing is all these like famous,

2:04:11.260 --> 2:04:14.980
 you know, tech guys who have worked in the industry,

2:04:14.980 --> 2:04:17.280
 pontificating about the future of machine learning

2:04:17.280 --> 2:04:19.080
 and how it's gonna kill us all, right?

2:04:19.080 --> 2:04:22.340
 And like, I'm pretty sure they've never tried

2:04:22.340 --> 2:04:24.400
 to build anything with machine learning themselves.

2:04:24.400 --> 2:04:27.920
 Yes, so there's a nice line between people

2:04:27.920 --> 2:04:29.640
 that actually build stuff with machine,

2:04:29.640 --> 2:04:31.720
 like actually program something

2:04:31.720 --> 2:04:33.720
 or at least understand some of those fundamentals

2:04:33.720 --> 2:04:36.840
 and the people that are just saying philosophical stuff

2:04:36.840 --> 2:04:38.460
 or journalists and so on.

2:04:38.460 --> 2:04:40.840
 It's an interesting line to walk

2:04:40.840 --> 2:04:44.900
 because the people who program are often not philosophers.

2:04:44.900 --> 2:04:45.840
 Or don't have the attention,

2:04:45.840 --> 2:04:48.080
 they can't write an op ed for the Wall Street Journal,

2:04:48.080 --> 2:04:49.080
 like it doesn't work.

2:04:49.080 --> 2:04:51.380
 So like, it's nice to be both a little bit,

2:04:51.380 --> 2:04:52.880
 like to have elements of both.

2:04:52.880 --> 2:04:56.220
 My point is the fact that I have to learn stuff from scratch

2:04:56.220 --> 2:04:58.160
 or that I choose to are like.

2:04:58.160 --> 2:04:59.760
 It's humbling.

2:04:59.760 --> 2:05:02.960
 Yeah, I mean, again, I have a lot of advantages.

2:05:02.960 --> 2:05:06.560
 I like, but my point is it's awesome

2:05:06.560 --> 2:05:11.560
 to be back in a game where you have to fight.

2:05:11.800 --> 2:05:13.180
 That is, that's fun.

2:05:13.180 --> 2:05:15.240
 So being humble, being vulnerable,

2:05:16.300 --> 2:05:18.040
 it's an important aspect of a leader

2:05:18.040 --> 2:05:19.240
 and I hope it serves me well,

2:05:19.240 --> 2:05:22.000
 but like, I can't fast forward 10 years to now.

2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:24.040
 I've just, that's my game plan.

2:05:24.040 --> 2:05:26.120
 Before I forget, I have to ask you one last thing

2:05:26.120 --> 2:05:27.380
 on Instagram.

2:05:28.920 --> 2:05:30.760
 What do you think about the whistleblower,

2:05:30.760 --> 2:05:33.400
 Frances Haugen, recently coming out

2:05:33.400 --> 2:05:36.360
 and saying that Facebook is aware of Instagram's

2:05:36.360 --> 2:05:38.700
 harmful effect on teenage girls

2:05:39.960 --> 2:05:43.320
 as per their own internal research studies on the matter?

2:05:43.320 --> 2:05:46.040
 What do you think about this baby of yours,

2:05:46.040 --> 2:05:48.240
 Instagram being under fire now,

2:05:48.240 --> 2:05:52.080
 as we've been talking about under the leadership of Facebook?

2:05:54.260 --> 2:05:59.260
 You know, I often question, where does the blame lie?

2:05:59.260 --> 2:06:04.260
 Is the blame at the people that originated the network me?

2:06:06.780 --> 2:06:10.540
 Is the blame at like the decision to combine the network

2:06:10.540 --> 2:06:14.420
 with another network with a certain set of values?

2:06:15.780 --> 2:06:20.500
 Is the blame at how it gets run after I left?

2:06:20.500 --> 2:06:23.640
 Like, is it the driver or is it the car, right?

2:06:25.820 --> 2:06:29.180
 Is it that someone enabled these devices in the first place?

2:06:29.180 --> 2:06:31.780
 If you go to an extreme, right?

2:06:31.780 --> 2:06:35.740
 Or is it the users themselves, just human nature?

2:06:35.740 --> 2:06:37.740
 Is it just the way of human nature?

2:06:37.740 --> 2:06:39.840
 Sure, and like the idea that we're gonna find

2:06:39.840 --> 2:06:42.020
 a mutually exclusive answer here is crazy.

2:06:42.020 --> 2:06:43.980
 There's not one place that's a combination

2:06:43.980 --> 2:06:45.660
 of a lot of these things.

2:06:45.660 --> 2:06:48.020
 And then the question is like, is it true at all, right?

2:06:48.020 --> 2:06:50.820
 Like I'm not actually saying that's not true

2:06:50.820 --> 2:06:55.520
 or that it's true, but there's always more nuance here.

2:06:55.520 --> 2:06:59.260
 Do I believe that social media has an effect

2:06:59.260 --> 2:07:00.260
 on young people?

2:07:00.260 --> 2:07:02.380
 Well, it's got it, they use it a lot.

2:07:02.380 --> 2:07:04.300
 And I bet you there are a lot of positive effects

2:07:04.300 --> 2:07:05.740
 and I bet you there are negative effects,

2:07:05.740 --> 2:07:07.620
 just like any technology.

2:07:07.620 --> 2:07:10.180
 And where I've come to in my thinking on this

2:07:10.180 --> 2:07:13.420
 is that I think any technology has negative side effects.

2:07:13.420 --> 2:07:16.540
 The question is, as a leader, what do you do about them?

2:07:16.540 --> 2:07:18.180
 And are you actively working on them

2:07:18.180 --> 2:07:20.620
 or do you just like not really believe in them?

2:07:20.620 --> 2:07:22.380
 If you're a leader that sits there and says,

2:07:22.380 --> 2:07:24.060
 well, we're gonna put an enormous amount

2:07:24.060 --> 2:07:26.280
 of resources against this.

2:07:26.280 --> 2:07:29.580
 We're gonna acknowledge when there are true criticisms,

2:07:29.580 --> 2:07:32.620
 we're gonna be vulnerable and that we're not perfect

2:07:32.620 --> 2:07:33.700
 and we're gonna go fix them

2:07:33.700 --> 2:07:36.200
 and we're gonna be held accountable along the way.

2:07:37.220 --> 2:07:39.920
 I think that people generally really respect that.

2:07:41.540 --> 2:07:44.340
 But I think that where Facebook I think has had issues

2:07:44.340 --> 2:07:46.880
 in the past is where they say things like,

2:07:46.880 --> 2:07:49.500
 can't remember what Mark said about misinformation

2:07:49.500 --> 2:07:50.340
 during the election.

2:07:50.340 --> 2:07:52.640
 There was that like famous quote where he was like,

2:07:52.640 --> 2:07:54.780
 it's pretty crazy to think that Facebook had anything

2:07:54.780 --> 2:07:55.660
 to do with this election.

2:07:55.660 --> 2:07:57.140
 Like that was something like that quote.

2:07:57.140 --> 2:08:00.340
 And I don't remember what stage he was on and yeah.

2:08:00.340 --> 2:08:02.580
 But ooh, that did not age well, right?

2:08:02.580 --> 2:08:05.660
 Like you have to be willing to say,

2:08:05.660 --> 2:08:09.700
 well, maybe there's something there and wow,

2:08:09.700 --> 2:08:11.060
 like I wanna go look into it

2:08:11.060 --> 2:08:12.900
 and truly believe it in your gut.

2:08:12.900 --> 2:08:14.580
 But if people look at you and how you act

2:08:14.580 --> 2:08:18.680
 and what you say and don't believe you truly feel that way.

2:08:18.680 --> 2:08:20.860
 It's not just the words you say, but how you say them

2:08:20.860 --> 2:08:23.780
 and that people believe they actually feel the pain

2:08:23.780 --> 2:08:25.380
 of having caused any suffering in the world.

2:08:25.380 --> 2:08:29.320
 So to me, it's much more about your actions

2:08:29.320 --> 2:08:31.540
 and your posture post event

2:08:31.540 --> 2:08:33.060
 than it is about debugging the why.

2:08:33.060 --> 2:08:36.780
 Cause I don't know, is it like, I don't know this research.

2:08:36.780 --> 2:08:38.440
 It was written well after I left, right?

2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:41.060
 Like, is it the algorithm?

2:08:41.060 --> 2:08:42.360
 Is it the explore page?

2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:45.460
 Is it the people you might know unit connecting you

2:08:45.460 --> 2:08:47.860
 to ideas that are dangerous?

2:08:47.860 --> 2:08:51.060
 Like I really don't know.

2:08:51.060 --> 2:08:53.580
 So we'd have to have a much deeper,

2:08:53.580 --> 2:08:56.580
 I think dive to understand where the blame lies.

2:08:56.580 --> 2:08:58.700
 What's very unpleasant to me to consider,

2:08:58.700 --> 2:09:00.060
 now, I don't know if this is true,

2:09:00.060 --> 2:09:03.660
 but to consider the very fact that there might be

2:09:03.660 --> 2:09:07.020
 some complicated games being played here.

2:09:07.020 --> 2:09:10.780
 For example, as somebody, I really love psychology

2:09:10.780 --> 2:09:13.540
 and I love it enough to know that the field

2:09:13.540 --> 2:09:15.660
 is pretty broken in the following way.

2:09:15.660 --> 2:09:19.980
 It's very difficult to study human beings well at scale

2:09:19.980 --> 2:09:22.820
 because the questions you ask affect the results.

2:09:22.820 --> 2:09:25.060
 You can basically get any results you want.

2:09:25.060 --> 2:09:27.300
 And so you have an internal Facebook study

2:09:27.300 --> 2:09:29.680
 that asks some question of which we don't know

2:09:29.680 --> 2:09:32.580
 the full details and there's some kind of analysis,

2:09:32.580 --> 2:09:34.820
 but that's just the one little tiny slice

2:09:34.820 --> 2:09:37.060
 into some much bigger picture.

2:09:37.060 --> 2:09:40.940
 And so you can have thousands of employees at Facebook.

2:09:40.940 --> 2:09:44.360
 One of them comes out and picks whatever narrative,

2:09:44.360 --> 2:09:46.460
 knowing that they become famous,

2:09:46.460 --> 2:09:49.200
 coupled with the other really uncomfortable thing

2:09:49.200 --> 2:09:53.280
 I see in the world, which is journalists seem to understand

2:09:53.280 --> 2:09:55.840
 they get a lot of clickbait attention

2:09:55.840 --> 2:09:58.420
 from saying something negative about social networks.

2:09:58.420 --> 2:10:03.420
 Certain companies, like they even get some clickbait stuff

2:10:03.780 --> 2:10:07.700
 about Tesla or about, especially when it's like,

2:10:07.700 --> 2:10:11.060
 when there's a public famous CEO type of person,

2:10:11.060 --> 2:10:14.500
 if they get a lot of views on the negative, not the positive,

2:10:14.500 --> 2:10:16.380
 the positive, they'll get, I mean,

2:10:16.380 --> 2:10:18.300
 it actually goes to the thing you were saying before,

2:10:18.300 --> 2:10:20.780
 if there's a hot, sexy new product,

2:10:20.780 --> 2:10:23.540
 that's great to look forward to, they get positive on that,

2:10:23.540 --> 2:10:28.540
 but absent a product, it's nice to have like the CEO

2:10:28.580 --> 2:10:30.260
 messing up in some kind of way.

2:10:30.260 --> 2:10:33.580
 And so couple that with the whistleblower

2:10:33.580 --> 2:10:38.300
 and with this whole dynamic of journalism and so on,

2:10:38.300 --> 2:10:41.180
 you know, with Social Dilemma being really popular,

2:10:41.180 --> 2:10:44.620
 documentary, it's like, all right,

2:10:44.620 --> 2:10:48.800
 my concern is there's deep flaws in human nature here

2:10:48.800 --> 2:10:51.300
 in terms of things we need to deal with,

2:10:51.300 --> 2:10:54.420
 like the nature of hate, of bullying,

2:10:54.420 --> 2:10:56.280
 all those kinds of things.

2:10:56.280 --> 2:10:59.060
 And then there's people who are trying to use that

2:11:00.060 --> 2:11:02.420
 potentially to become famous and make money

2:11:02.420 --> 2:11:06.980
 off of blaming others for causing more of the problem

2:11:06.980 --> 2:11:08.860
 as opposed to helping solve the problem.

2:11:08.860 --> 2:11:10.220
 So I don't know what to think.

2:11:10.220 --> 2:11:12.900
 I'm not saying this is like, I'm just uncomfortable

2:11:12.900 --> 2:11:16.740
 with, I guess, not knowing what to think about any of this

2:11:16.740 --> 2:11:19.500
 because a bunch of folks I know that work at Facebook

2:11:19.500 --> 2:11:21.500
 on the machine learning side, so Yann LeCun,

2:11:21.500 --> 2:11:25.160
 I mean, they're quite upset about what's happening

2:11:25.160 --> 2:11:26.860
 because there's a lot of really brilliant,

2:11:26.860 --> 2:11:30.700
 good people inside Facebook that are trying to do good.

2:11:30.700 --> 2:11:33.420
 And so like all of this press, Yann is one of them,

2:11:33.420 --> 2:11:34.500
 and he has an amazing team

2:11:34.500 --> 2:11:35.740
 with the machine learning researchers.

2:11:35.740 --> 2:11:38.540
 Like he's really upset with the fact

2:11:38.540 --> 2:11:40.540
 that people don't seem to understand

2:11:40.540 --> 2:11:43.660
 that the portrayal does not represent

2:11:43.660 --> 2:11:46.620
 the full nature of efforts that's going on at Facebook.

2:11:46.620 --> 2:11:48.220
 So I don't know what to think about that.

2:11:48.220 --> 2:11:52.700
 Well, you just, I think, very helpfully explained

2:11:52.700 --> 2:11:54.060
 the nuance of the situation

2:11:54.060 --> 2:11:56.300
 and why it's so hard to understand.

2:11:56.300 --> 2:11:57.140
 But a couple of things.

2:11:57.140 --> 2:12:02.140
 One is I think I have been surprised

2:12:02.140 --> 2:12:07.140
 at the scale with which some product manager

2:12:11.940 --> 2:12:14.380
 can do an enormous amount of harm

2:12:14.380 --> 2:12:16.140
 to a very, very large company

2:12:17.260 --> 2:12:19.260
 by releasing a trove of documents.

2:12:19.260 --> 2:12:21.940
 Like I think I read a couple of them when they got published

2:12:21.940 --> 2:12:24.140
 and I haven't even spent any time going deep.

2:12:24.140 --> 2:12:26.040
 Part of it's like, I don't really feel like reliving

2:12:26.040 --> 2:12:30.780
 a previous life, but wow.

2:12:30.780 --> 2:12:34.420
 Like talk about challenging the idea of open culture

2:12:34.420 --> 2:12:37.540
 and like what that does to Facebook internally.

2:12:37.540 --> 2:12:42.060
 If Facebook was built, like I remember like my office,

2:12:43.340 --> 2:12:45.700
 we had this like no visitors rule around my office

2:12:45.700 --> 2:12:47.500
 because we always had like confidential stuff up

2:12:47.500 --> 2:12:50.340
 on the walls and everyone was super angry

2:12:50.340 --> 2:12:52.040
 because they're like, that goes against our culture

2:12:52.040 --> 2:12:54.700
 of transparency and like marks in the fish cube

2:12:54.700 --> 2:12:56.260
 or whatever they call it, the aquarium,

2:12:56.260 --> 2:12:59.300
 I think they called it, where like literally anyone could see

2:12:59.300 --> 2:13:03.300
 what he was doing at any point and I don't know.

2:13:03.300 --> 2:13:06.540
 I mean, other companies like Apple have been quiet

2:13:06.540 --> 2:13:10.240
 slash locked down, Snapchat's the same way for a reason.

2:13:10.240 --> 2:13:14.260
 And I don't know what this does to transparency

2:13:14.260 --> 2:13:16.820
 on the inside of startups that value that.

2:13:16.820 --> 2:13:20.140
 I think that it's a seminal moment and you can say,

2:13:20.140 --> 2:13:22.300
 well, you should have nothing to hide, right?

2:13:22.300 --> 2:13:24.620
 But to your point, you can pick out documents

2:13:24.620 --> 2:13:26.600
 that show anything, right?

2:13:27.660 --> 2:13:28.500
 But I don't know.

2:13:28.500 --> 2:13:31.380
 What happens to transparency inside of startups

2:13:31.380 --> 2:13:35.440
 and the culture that startups or companies

2:13:35.440 --> 2:13:37.980
 in the future will grow, like the startup of the future

2:13:37.980 --> 2:13:40.420
 that becomes the next Facebook will be locked down

2:13:40.420 --> 2:13:42.580
 and what does that do, right?

2:13:42.580 --> 2:13:44.220
 So that's part one.

2:13:44.220 --> 2:13:49.220
 Part two, like I don't think that you could design

2:13:49.500 --> 2:13:54.500
 a more like a well orchestrated handful of events

2:13:54.500 --> 2:13:59.500
 from the like 16 minutes to releasing the documents

2:13:59.820 --> 2:14:02.420
 in the way that they were released at the right time.

2:14:02.420 --> 2:14:05.580
 That takes a lot of planning and partnership.

2:14:05.580 --> 2:14:09.060
 And it seems like she has a partner at some firm, right?

2:14:09.060 --> 2:14:12.940
 That probably helped a lot with this, but man,

2:14:12.940 --> 2:14:15.340
 at a personal level, if you're her,

2:14:15.340 --> 2:14:19.860
 you'd have to really believe in what you are doing,

2:14:19.860 --> 2:14:22.620
 really believe in it because you are personally

2:14:22.620 --> 2:14:25.140
 putting your ass on the line, right?

2:14:25.140 --> 2:14:29.020
 Like you've got a very large company

2:14:29.020 --> 2:14:31.560
 that doesn't like enemies, right?

2:14:33.700 --> 2:14:37.940
 It takes a lot of guts and I don't love

2:14:37.940 --> 2:14:39.700
 these conspiracy theories about like,

2:14:39.700 --> 2:14:42.380
 oh, she's being financed from some person or people.

2:14:42.380 --> 2:14:43.700
 Like I don't love them because that's

2:14:43.700 --> 2:14:45.680
 like the easy thing to say.

2:14:45.680 --> 2:14:49.340
 I think the Occam's razor here is like someone thought

2:14:49.340 --> 2:14:51.300
 they were doing something wrong

2:14:51.300 --> 2:14:54.540
 and was like very, very courageous.

2:14:54.540 --> 2:14:57.500
 And I don't know if courageous is the word,

2:14:57.500 --> 2:15:00.540
 but like, so without getting into like,

2:15:00.540 --> 2:15:01.800
 is she a martyr?

2:15:01.800 --> 2:15:02.640
 Is she courageous?

2:15:02.640 --> 2:15:03.480
 Is she right?

2:15:03.480 --> 2:15:05.860
 Like, let's put that aside for a second.

2:15:05.860 --> 2:15:07.460
 Then there are the documents themselves.

2:15:07.460 --> 2:15:08.620
 They say what they say.

2:15:09.580 --> 2:15:12.420
 To your point, a lot of the things that like people

2:15:12.420 --> 2:15:15.060
 have been worried about already in the documents

2:15:15.060 --> 2:15:17.260
 or they're already been said externally.

2:15:17.260 --> 2:15:22.260
 And I don't know, I'm just like, I'm thankful

2:15:22.340 --> 2:15:24.640
 that I am focused on new things with my life.

2:15:25.820 --> 2:15:27.860
 Well, let me just say, I just think it's a really

2:15:27.860 --> 2:15:30.860
 hard problem that probably Facebook and Twitter

2:15:30.860 --> 2:15:32.280
 are trying to solve.

2:15:32.280 --> 2:15:35.340
 I'm actually just fascinated by how hard this problem is.

2:15:35.340 --> 2:15:38.380
 There are fundamental issues at Facebook in tone

2:15:38.380 --> 2:15:41.740
 and in an approach of how product gets built

2:15:41.740 --> 2:15:43.100
 and the objective functions.

2:15:43.100 --> 2:15:48.100
 And since people, organizations are not people.

2:15:48.280 --> 2:15:50.000
 So yawn and fair, right?

2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:51.740
 Like there are a lot of really great people

2:15:51.740 --> 2:15:53.380
 who like literally just want to push

2:15:53.380 --> 2:15:55.220
 reinforcement learning forward.

2:15:55.220 --> 2:15:56.940
 They literally just want to teach a robot

2:15:56.940 --> 2:15:59.380
 to touch, feel, lift, right?

2:15:59.380 --> 2:16:02.820
 Like they're not thinking about political misinformation,

2:16:02.820 --> 2:16:03.880
 right?

2:16:03.880 --> 2:16:07.440
 But there's a strong connection between what funds

2:16:07.440 --> 2:16:10.740
 that research and an enormously profitable machine

2:16:10.740 --> 2:16:13.360
 that has trade offs.

2:16:13.360 --> 2:16:18.200
 And one cannot separate the two.

2:16:18.200 --> 2:16:21.400
 You are not completely separate from the system.

2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:24.520
 So I agree, it can feel really frustrating

2:16:24.520 --> 2:16:27.220
 to feel if you're internal there,

2:16:27.220 --> 2:16:29.600
 that you're working on something completely unrelated

2:16:29.600 --> 2:16:31.200
 and you feel like your group's good.

2:16:31.200 --> 2:16:32.840
 I can understand that.

2:16:32.840 --> 2:16:34.440
 But there's some responsibility still.

2:16:34.440 --> 2:16:36.440
 You have to acknowledge, it's like the Ray Dalio thing.

2:16:36.440 --> 2:16:38.960
 You have to look in the mirror and see if there's problems

2:16:38.960 --> 2:16:40.280
 and you have to fix those problems.

2:16:40.280 --> 2:16:41.120
 Yeah.

2:16:43.360 --> 2:16:46.720
 You mentioned machine learning reinforcement quite a bit.

2:16:46.720 --> 2:16:50.200
 I mean, to me, social networks is one of the exciting places,

2:16:50.200 --> 2:16:52.840
 recommender systems where machine learning is applied.

2:16:52.840 --> 2:16:56.440
 Where else in the world, in the space of possibilities

2:16:56.440 --> 2:16:58.200
 over the next five, 10, 20 years,

2:16:58.200 --> 2:17:02.140
 do you think we're going to see impact of machine learning

2:17:02.140 --> 2:17:05.000
 when you try, on the philosophical level,

2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:07.280
 on a technical level, what do you think?

2:17:07.280 --> 2:17:10.460
 Or within social networks themselves?

2:17:11.720 --> 2:17:16.720
 Well, I think the obvious answers are climate change.

2:17:17.120 --> 2:17:19.800
 Think about how much fuel

2:17:19.800 --> 2:17:24.520
 or just waste there is in energy consumption today

2:17:24.520 --> 2:17:27.460
 because we don't plan accordingly,

2:17:27.460 --> 2:17:30.960
 because we take the least efficient route or...

2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:32.640
 The logistics and stuff, the supply chain,

2:17:32.640 --> 2:17:33.480
 all that kind of stuff.

2:17:33.480 --> 2:17:36.600
 Yeah, I mean, listen, if we're gonna fight climate change,

2:17:36.600 --> 2:17:39.920
 like one really way, one awesome way to do it

2:17:39.920 --> 2:17:43.280
 is figure out how to optimize how we operate as a species

2:17:43.280 --> 2:17:47.220
 and minimize the amount of energy we consume

2:17:47.220 --> 2:17:51.080
 to maximize whatever economic impact we wanna have.

2:17:51.080 --> 2:17:53.900
 Because right now those two are very much tied together.

2:17:53.900 --> 2:17:56.520
 And I don't believe that that has to be the case.

2:17:56.520 --> 2:17:59.020
 There's this really interesting, you've read it.

2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:00.840
 For people who are listening,

2:18:00.840 --> 2:18:02.680
 there's this really interesting paper

2:18:02.680 --> 2:18:04.000
 on reinforcement learning

2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:06.200
 and energy consumption inside buildings.

2:18:06.200 --> 2:18:08.280
 It's like one of the seminal ones, right?

2:18:08.280 --> 2:18:10.280
 But imagine that at massive scale.

2:18:10.280 --> 2:18:11.280
 That's super interesting.

2:18:11.280 --> 2:18:15.300
 I mean, they've done resource planning for servers

2:18:15.300 --> 2:18:17.800
 for peak load using reinforcement learning.

2:18:17.800 --> 2:18:19.560
 I don't know if that was at Google or somewhere else,

2:18:19.560 --> 2:18:21.880
 but like, okay, great, you do it for servers,

2:18:21.880 --> 2:18:24.040
 but what if you could do it for just capacity

2:18:24.040 --> 2:18:26.200
 and general energy capacity for cities

2:18:26.200 --> 2:18:27.520
 and planning for traffic?

2:18:27.520 --> 2:18:30.960
 And of course there's all the self driving cars

2:18:30.960 --> 2:18:34.060
 and I don't know, like I'm not gonna pontificate

2:18:34.060 --> 2:18:39.060
 on like crazy ideas using reinforcement learning

2:18:39.320 --> 2:18:40.160
 or machine learning.

2:18:40.160 --> 2:18:41.240
 It's just so clear to me

2:18:41.240 --> 2:18:43.640
 that humans don't think quickly enough.

2:18:43.640 --> 2:18:46.520
 So it's interesting to think about machine learning

2:18:46.520 --> 2:18:49.680
 helping a little bit at scale.

2:18:49.680 --> 2:18:52.000
 So a little bit to a large number of people

2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:53.460
 that has a huge impact.

2:18:53.460 --> 2:18:57.320
 So if you optimize, say Google Maps, something like that,

2:18:57.320 --> 2:19:00.120
 trajectory planning or what a map quest first.

2:19:01.200 --> 2:19:02.960
 Getting here, I looked and it was like,

2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:04.520
 here's the most energy efficient route.

2:19:04.520 --> 2:19:05.680
 And I was like, I'm gonna be late.

2:19:05.680 --> 2:19:07.280
 I need to take the fastest route.

2:19:07.280 --> 2:19:09.160
 As opposed to unrolling the map.

2:19:09.160 --> 2:19:10.640
 Yeah, yeah.

2:19:10.640 --> 2:19:12.960
 Like, and then that's going to be very inefficient

2:19:12.960 --> 2:19:13.800
 no matter what.

2:19:13.800 --> 2:19:14.800
 I was definitely the other day,

2:19:14.800 --> 2:19:17.820
 like part of the Epsilon of Epsilon Greedy

2:19:17.820 --> 2:19:21.800
 with Waze where like I was sent on like a weird route

2:19:21.800 --> 2:19:22.960
 that I could tell they're like,

2:19:22.960 --> 2:19:24.960
 we just need to collect data at this road.

2:19:24.960 --> 2:19:26.920
 Like we just, Kevin's.

2:19:26.920 --> 2:19:28.760
 You were the ant they sent out for exploration.

2:19:28.760 --> 2:19:30.400
 Kevin's definitely gonna be the guinea pig.

2:19:30.400 --> 2:19:32.120
 And great, now we have.

2:19:32.120 --> 2:19:34.160
 Did you at least feel pride?

2:19:34.160 --> 2:19:36.000
 Oh, going through it, I was like, oh, this is fun.

2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:38.280
 Like now they get data about this weird shortcut.

2:19:38.280 --> 2:19:40.180
 And actually I hit all the green lights networked.

2:19:40.180 --> 2:19:41.880
 I'm like, this is a problem.

2:19:41.880 --> 2:19:42.720
 Bad data.

2:19:42.720 --> 2:19:44.680
 Bad data, they're just gonna imagine.

2:19:44.680 --> 2:19:47.520
 I could see you slowing down and stopping at a green light

2:19:47.520 --> 2:19:50.080
 just to give them the right kind of data.

2:19:50.080 --> 2:19:51.000
 But to answer your question,

2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:53.400
 like I feel like that was fairly unsatisfying

2:19:53.400 --> 2:19:55.000
 and it's easy to say climate change.

2:19:55.000 --> 2:19:58.640
 But what I would say is at Instagram,

2:19:58.640 --> 2:20:02.120
 everything we applied machine learning to

2:20:02.120 --> 2:20:04.800
 got better for users and it got better for the company.

2:20:04.800 --> 2:20:06.200
 I saw the power.

2:20:06.200 --> 2:20:08.200
 I didn't fully understand it as an executive.

2:20:08.200 --> 2:20:10.640
 And I think that's actually one of the issues

2:20:10.640 --> 2:20:12.860
 that, and when I say understand,

2:20:12.860 --> 2:20:14.020
 I mean the mathematics of it.

2:20:14.020 --> 2:20:15.320
 Like I understand what it does.

2:20:15.320 --> 2:20:17.040
 I understand that it helps.

2:20:17.040 --> 2:20:20.120
 But there are a lot of executives now

2:20:20.120 --> 2:20:22.080
 that talk about it in the way

2:20:22.080 --> 2:20:23.680
 that they talk about the internet

2:20:23.680 --> 2:20:25.560
 or they talked about the internet like 10 years ago.

2:20:25.560 --> 2:20:27.040
 They're like, we're gonna build mobile.

2:20:27.040 --> 2:20:27.940
 And you're like, what does that mean?

2:20:27.940 --> 2:20:29.400
 They're like, we're just gonna do mobile.

2:20:29.400 --> 2:20:31.220
 And you're like, okay.

2:20:31.220 --> 2:20:33.900
 So my sense is the next generation of leaders

2:20:33.900 --> 2:20:37.160
 will have grown up having had classes

2:20:37.160 --> 2:20:40.160
 in reinforcement learning, supervised learning, whatever.

2:20:40.160 --> 2:20:42.880
 And they will be able to thoughtfully apply it

2:20:42.880 --> 2:20:46.280
 to their companies and the places that it is needed most.

2:20:46.280 --> 2:20:47.660
 And that's really cool.

2:20:47.660 --> 2:20:50.000
 Cause I mean, talk about efficiency gains.

2:20:53.040 --> 2:20:54.760
 That's what excites me the most about it.

2:20:54.760 --> 2:20:58.080
 Yeah, so there's, it's interesting just to get a fundamental

2:20:58.080 --> 2:20:59.440
 first principles understanding

2:20:59.440 --> 2:21:01.000
 of certain concepts of machine learning.

2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:04.400
 So supervised learning from an executive perspective,

2:21:04.400 --> 2:21:07.020
 supervised learning, you have to have a lot of humans

2:21:07.020 --> 2:21:08.440
 label a lot of data.

2:21:08.440 --> 2:21:09.960
 So the question there is, okay,

2:21:09.960 --> 2:21:12.380
 can we gather a large amount of data

2:21:12.380 --> 2:21:14.360
 that can be labeled well?

2:21:14.360 --> 2:21:16.080
 And that's the question Tesla asked,

2:21:16.080 --> 2:21:17.760
 like can we create a data engine

2:21:17.760 --> 2:21:22.040
 that keeps sending an imperfect machine learning system

2:21:22.040 --> 2:21:25.000
 out there, whenever it fails, it gives us data back.

2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:27.640
 We label it by human and we send it back and forth

2:21:27.640 --> 2:21:28.640
 to this way.

2:21:28.640 --> 2:21:30.440
 Then there's Yann LeCun's excited

2:21:30.440 --> 2:21:32.380
 about the self supervised learning

2:21:32.380 --> 2:21:36.140
 where you do much less human labeling

2:21:36.140 --> 2:21:38.880
 and there's some kind of mechanism for the system

2:21:38.880 --> 2:21:42.760
 to learn it by itself on the human generated data.

2:21:42.760 --> 2:21:44.760
 And then there's the reinforcement learning,

2:21:44.760 --> 2:21:47.800
 which is like basically allowing,

2:21:47.800 --> 2:21:52.080
 it's applying the alpha zero technology

2:21:52.080 --> 2:21:56.080
 that allow through self play to learn how to solve

2:21:56.080 --> 2:21:59.920
 the game of Go and achieve incredible levels

2:21:59.920 --> 2:22:01.140
 at the game of chess.

2:22:02.580 --> 2:22:05.160
 Can you formulate the problem you're trying to solve

2:22:05.160 --> 2:22:07.600
 in a way that's amenable to reinforcement learning?

2:22:07.600 --> 2:22:09.960
 And can you get the right kind of signal at scale?

2:22:09.960 --> 2:22:11.840
 Cause you need a lot of signal.

2:22:11.840 --> 2:22:15.480
 And that's kind of fascinating to see which part

2:22:15.480 --> 2:22:17.640
 of a social network can you convert

2:22:17.640 --> 2:22:19.440
 into reinforcement learning problem.

2:22:19.440 --> 2:22:22.280
 The fascinating thing about reinforcement learning,

2:22:22.280 --> 2:22:25.960
 I think, is that we now have learned

2:22:25.960 --> 2:22:30.960
 to apply neural networks to guess the Q function,

2:22:34.260 --> 2:22:37.920
 basically the values for any state in action.

2:22:37.920 --> 2:22:40.480
 And that is fascinating cause we used to just like,

2:22:40.480 --> 2:22:42.160
 I don't know, have like a linear regression,

2:22:42.160 --> 2:22:45.320
 like hope it worked and that was the fanciest version of it.

2:22:45.320 --> 2:22:47.400
 But now you look at it, I'm like trying to learn this stuff

2:22:47.400 --> 2:22:48.440
 and I look at it and I'm like,

2:22:48.440 --> 2:22:51.640
 there are like 17 different acronyms of different ways

2:22:51.640 --> 2:22:52.760
 you can try to apply this.

2:22:52.760 --> 2:22:56.080
 No one quite agrees, like what's the best.

2:22:56.080 --> 2:22:58.880
 Generally, if you're trying to like build a neural network,

2:22:58.880 --> 2:23:02.120
 there are pretty well trodden ways of doing that.

2:23:02.120 --> 2:23:04.520
 You use Adam, you use ReLU,

2:23:04.520 --> 2:23:07.360
 like there's just like general good ideas.

2:23:07.360 --> 2:23:08.840
 And in reinforcement learning,

2:23:08.840 --> 2:23:12.640
 I feel like the consensus is like, it totally depends.

2:23:13.720 --> 2:23:16.440
 And by the way, it's really hard to get it to converge

2:23:16.440 --> 2:23:18.640
 and it's noisy and it like,

2:23:18.640 --> 2:23:20.640
 so there are all these really interesting ideas

2:23:20.640 --> 2:23:22.260
 around building simulators.

2:23:23.600 --> 2:23:25.700
 You know, like for instance, in self driving, right?

2:23:25.700 --> 2:23:29.300
 Like you don't want to like actually have someone

2:23:29.300 --> 2:23:31.880
 getting in an accident to learn that an accident is bad.

2:23:31.880 --> 2:23:33.920
 So you start simulating accidents,

2:23:33.920 --> 2:23:35.440
 simulating aggressive drivers,

2:23:35.440 --> 2:23:38.080
 just simulating crazy dogs that run into the street and,

2:23:39.120 --> 2:23:41.280
 wow, fascinating, right?

2:23:41.280 --> 2:23:43.600
 Like my mind starts racing and then the question is,

2:23:43.600 --> 2:23:45.920
 okay, forget about self driving cars.

2:23:45.920 --> 2:23:48.480
 Let's talk about social networks.

2:23:49.780 --> 2:23:52.960
 How can you produce a better, more thoughtful experience

2:23:52.960 --> 2:23:55.840
 using these types of algorithms?

2:23:55.840 --> 2:23:58.200
 And honestly, in talking to some of the people

2:23:58.200 --> 2:24:01.640
 that work at Facebook and old Instagrammers,

2:24:01.640 --> 2:24:04.160
 most people are like, yeah, we tried a lot of things,

2:24:04.160 --> 2:24:05.600
 didn't quite ever make it work.

2:24:05.600 --> 2:24:06.720
 I mean, for the longest time,

2:24:06.720 --> 2:24:10.600
 Facebook ads was effectively a logistic regression, okay?

2:24:10.600 --> 2:24:11.740
 I don't know what it is now,

2:24:11.740 --> 2:24:13.160
 but like if you look at this paper

2:24:13.160 --> 2:24:14.080
 that they published back in the day,

2:24:14.080 --> 2:24:16.120
 it was literally just a logistic regression.

2:24:16.120 --> 2:24:17.120
 Made a lot of money.

2:24:18.960 --> 2:24:21.760
 So even at these like extremely large scales,

2:24:21.760 --> 2:24:23.320
 if we are not yet touching

2:24:23.320 --> 2:24:25.520
 what reinforcement learning can truly do,

2:24:25.520 --> 2:24:27.400
 imagine what the next 10 years looks like.

2:24:27.400 --> 2:24:28.600
 How cool is that?

2:24:28.600 --> 2:24:29.620
 It's amazing.

2:24:29.620 --> 2:24:32.200
 So I really liked the use of reinforcement learning

2:24:32.200 --> 2:24:34.760
 as part of the simulation, for example,

2:24:34.760 --> 2:24:37.760
 like with self driving cars, it's modeling pedestrians.

2:24:37.760 --> 2:24:40.440
 So the nice thing about reinforcement learning,

2:24:40.440 --> 2:24:45.040
 it can be used to learn agents within the world.

2:24:45.040 --> 2:24:47.080
 So they can learn to behave properly.

2:24:47.080 --> 2:24:49.360
 Like you can teach pedestrians to,

2:24:49.360 --> 2:24:51.640
 like you don't hard code the way they behave,

2:24:51.640 --> 2:24:53.280
 they learn how to behave.

2:24:53.280 --> 2:24:55.200
 In that same way, I do have a hope,

2:24:55.200 --> 2:24:58.280
 was it Jack Dorsey talks about healthy conversations.

2:24:58.280 --> 2:25:01.640
 You talked about meaningful interactions, I believe.

2:25:03.520 --> 2:25:06.940
 Like simulating interactions.

2:25:06.940 --> 2:25:09.480
 So you can learn how to manage that, it's fascinating.

2:25:09.480 --> 2:25:13.040
 So where most of your algorithm development happens

2:25:13.040 --> 2:25:16.480
 in virtual worlds, and then you can really learn

2:25:16.480 --> 2:25:18.120
 how to design the interface,

2:25:18.120 --> 2:25:21.400
 how you design a bunch of aspects of the experience

2:25:21.400 --> 2:25:24.480
 in terms of how you select what's shown in the feed,

2:25:24.480 --> 2:25:26.120
 all those kinds of things.

2:25:26.120 --> 2:25:28.480
 It feels like if you can connect reinforcement learning

2:25:28.480 --> 2:25:30.080
 to that, that's super exciting.

2:25:30.080 --> 2:25:35.080
 Yep, and I think if you have a company and leadership

2:25:35.080 --> 2:25:36.560
 that believe in doing the right things

2:25:36.560 --> 2:25:38.920
 and can apply this technology in the right way,

2:25:38.920 --> 2:25:41.440
 some really special stuff can happen.

2:25:41.440 --> 2:25:44.440
 It is mostly likely going to be a group of people

2:25:44.440 --> 2:25:47.960
 we've never heard about, start up from scratch, right?

2:25:49.360 --> 2:25:52.920
 And you asked if like new social networks could be built,

2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:54.300
 I've got to imagine they will be.

2:25:54.300 --> 2:25:58.400
 And whoever starts it, it might be some kids in a garage

2:25:58.400 --> 2:26:02.200
 that took these classes from these people, you, right?

2:26:02.200 --> 2:26:04.400
 And they're building all of these things

2:26:04.400 --> 2:26:06.320
 with this tech at the core.

2:26:06.320 --> 2:26:08.400
 So I'm trying not to be someone who just like throws

2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:11.880
 around reinforcement learning as a buzzword.

2:26:11.880 --> 2:26:16.240
 I truly believe that it is the most cutting edge

2:26:16.240 --> 2:26:18.320
 in what can happen in social networks.

2:26:18.320 --> 2:26:20.880
 And I also believe it's super hard.

2:26:20.880 --> 2:26:22.480
 Like it's super hard to make it work.

2:26:22.480 --> 2:26:24.040
 It's super hard to do it at scale.

2:26:24.040 --> 2:26:26.840
 It's super hard to find people that truly understand it.

2:26:26.840 --> 2:26:28.600
 So I'm not gonna say that like,

2:26:30.120 --> 2:26:31.760
 I think it'll be applied in social networks

2:26:31.760 --> 2:26:33.840
 before we have true self driving.

2:26:33.840 --> 2:26:36.920
 Yeah, we could argue about this for a long time,

2:26:36.920 --> 2:26:38.000
 but yes, I agree with you.

2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:40.480
 I think self driving is way harder than people realize.

2:26:40.480 --> 2:26:41.840
 Oh, absolutely.

2:26:41.840 --> 2:26:44.040
 Let me ask you in terms of that kid in the garage

2:26:44.040 --> 2:26:45.520
 or those couple of kids in the garage,

2:26:45.520 --> 2:26:47.040
 what advice would you give to them

2:26:47.040 --> 2:26:50.760
 if they wanna start a new social network or a business?

2:26:50.760 --> 2:26:52.280
 What advice would you give to somebody

2:26:52.280 --> 2:26:54.700
 with a big dream and a young startup?

2:26:56.880 --> 2:26:59.500
 To me, you have to choose to do something

2:26:59.500 --> 2:27:03.800
 that even if it fails, like it was so fun, right?

2:27:03.800 --> 2:27:06.680
 Like we never started Instagram knowing

2:27:06.680 --> 2:27:07.760
 it was going to be big.

2:27:07.760 --> 2:27:10.480
 We started Instagram because we loved photography.

2:27:10.480 --> 2:27:12.480
 We loved social networks.

2:27:12.480 --> 2:27:14.520
 I had seen what other social networks had done

2:27:14.520 --> 2:27:17.640
 and I thought, hmm, maybe we did a spin on this,

2:27:17.640 --> 2:27:20.400
 but like nowhere was our feet predestined.

2:27:20.400 --> 2:27:23.640
 Like it wasn't like, it wasn't written out anywhere

2:27:23.640 --> 2:27:25.640
 that everything was gonna go great.

2:27:25.640 --> 2:27:27.000
 And I often think the counterfactual,

2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:28.820
 like what if it had not gone well?

2:27:28.820 --> 2:27:30.360
 I would have been like, I don't know, that was fun.

2:27:30.360 --> 2:27:32.280
 We raised some money, we learned some stuff

2:27:32.280 --> 2:27:37.280
 and does it position you well for the next experience?

2:27:37.280 --> 2:27:39.240
 That's the advice that I would give

2:27:39.240 --> 2:27:41.200
 to anyone wanting to start something today,

2:27:41.200 --> 2:27:45.120
 which is like, does this meet with your ultimate goals?

2:27:45.120 --> 2:27:47.200
 Not wealth, not fame, none of that,

2:27:47.200 --> 2:27:48.840
 because all of that, by the way, is bullshit.

2:27:48.840 --> 2:27:52.360
 Like you can get super famous and super wealthy.

2:27:52.360 --> 2:27:55.960
 And I think generally those are not things that,

2:27:57.400 --> 2:27:59.420
 again, it's easy to say with like a lot of money

2:27:59.420 --> 2:28:01.800
 that somehow like it's not good to have a lot of money.

2:28:01.800 --> 2:28:04.920
 It's just, I think that complicates life enormously

2:28:04.920 --> 2:28:06.900
 in a way that people don't fully comprehend.

2:28:06.900 --> 2:28:09.520
 So I think it is way more interesting to shoot for,

2:28:09.520 --> 2:28:11.760
 can I make something that people love,

2:28:11.760 --> 2:28:13.600
 that provides value in the world,

2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:17.520
 that I love building, that I love working on, right?

2:28:17.520 --> 2:28:21.920
 That's what I would do if I were starting from scratch.

2:28:21.920 --> 2:28:22.960
 And by the way, like in some ways

2:28:22.960 --> 2:28:25.200
 that I will do that personally,

2:28:25.200 --> 2:28:26.420
 which is like choose the thing

2:28:26.420 --> 2:28:27.920
 that you get up every morning and you're like,

2:28:27.920 --> 2:28:32.920
 I love this, even when it's painful.

2:28:33.160 --> 2:28:34.480
 Even when it's painful.

2:28:34.480 --> 2:28:36.780
 What about a social network specifically?

2:28:36.780 --> 2:28:40.600
 If you were to imagine, put yourself in the mind of some.

2:28:40.600 --> 2:28:42.000
 I can't compete against myself.

2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:43.600
 I can't give out ideas.

2:28:43.600 --> 2:28:44.440
 Okay, I got you.

2:28:44.440 --> 2:28:45.840
 No, but it's like high level.

2:28:45.840 --> 2:28:47.600
 You can focus on community.

2:28:47.600 --> 2:28:48.440
 Yeah.

2:28:50.360 --> 2:28:53.320
 I said that as a half joke.

2:28:54.160 --> 2:28:56.960
 In all honesty, I think these things are so hard to build

2:28:56.960 --> 2:28:59.960
 that like ideas are a dime a dozen, but.

2:28:59.960 --> 2:29:02.920
 You have talked about keeping it simple.

2:29:02.920 --> 2:29:03.760
 Can I tell you?

2:29:03.760 --> 2:29:04.920
 Which is a liberating idea.

2:29:04.920 --> 2:29:08.280
 My model is it's three circles and they overlap.

2:29:08.280 --> 2:29:11.360
 One circle is what do I have experience at?

2:29:11.360 --> 2:29:12.800
 Slash, what am I good at?

2:29:12.800 --> 2:29:14.140
 I don't like saying what am I good at

2:29:14.140 --> 2:29:16.040
 because it just like seems like,

2:29:16.040 --> 2:29:18.280
 what do I have experience in, right?

2:29:18.280 --> 2:29:19.720
 What can I bring to the table?

2:29:19.720 --> 2:29:22.040
 What am I excited about is the other circle.

2:29:22.040 --> 2:29:22.880
 What gets it?

2:29:22.880 --> 2:29:24.640
 What's just super cool, right?

2:29:24.640 --> 2:29:27.240
 That I want to work on because even when this is hard,

2:29:29.160 --> 2:29:30.000
 I think it's so cool.

2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:31.720
 I want to stick with it.

2:29:31.720 --> 2:29:34.960
 And the last circle is like, what does the world need?

2:29:34.960 --> 2:29:36.200
 And if that circle ain't there,

2:29:36.200 --> 2:29:37.720
 it doesn't matter what you work on.

2:29:37.720 --> 2:29:39.280
 Cause there are a lot of startups that exist

2:29:39.280 --> 2:29:43.200
 that just no one needs or very small markets need.

2:29:43.200 --> 2:29:44.840
 But if you want to be successful,

2:29:44.840 --> 2:29:47.240
 I think if you're like, if you're good at it,

2:29:47.240 --> 2:29:49.720
 you have, sorry, if you're good at it,

2:29:49.720 --> 2:29:51.640
 you're passionate about it and the world needs it.

2:29:51.640 --> 2:29:53.040
 I mean, this sounds simple,

2:29:53.040 --> 2:29:54.920
 not enough people sit down and just think

2:29:54.920 --> 2:29:58.120
 about those circles and think, do these things overlap?

2:29:58.120 --> 2:29:59.480
 And then can I get that middle section?

2:29:59.480 --> 2:30:01.720
 It's small, but can I get that middle section?

2:30:02.840 --> 2:30:04.640
 I think a lot about that personally.

2:30:05.960 --> 2:30:09.040
 And then you have to be really honest about the circle

2:30:09.040 --> 2:30:14.040
 that you're good at and really honest about the circle

2:30:14.400 --> 2:30:17.080
 that the world needs.

2:30:17.080 --> 2:30:20.280
 And as opposed to really honest about the passion,

2:30:20.280 --> 2:30:22.520
 like what do you actually love?

2:30:22.520 --> 2:30:24.600
 As opposed to like some kind of dream of making money,

2:30:24.600 --> 2:30:26.600
 all those kinds of stuff, like literally love doing.

2:30:26.600 --> 2:30:29.960
 I had a former engineer who decided to start a startup

2:30:29.960 --> 2:30:32.080
 and I was like, are you sure you want to start a company

2:30:32.080 --> 2:30:34.440
 versus like join something else?

2:30:34.440 --> 2:30:39.440
 Because being a coach of an NBA team and playing basketball

2:30:39.640 --> 2:30:41.440
 are two very, very different things.

2:30:42.320 --> 2:30:45.880
 And like not everyone fully understands the difference.

2:30:45.880 --> 2:30:47.680
 I think you can kind of do it both.

2:30:50.160 --> 2:30:51.960
 And I don't know, jury's out on that one

2:30:51.960 --> 2:30:54.600
 because like they're in the middle of it now.

2:30:54.600 --> 2:30:57.640
 But it's really important to figure out

2:30:57.640 --> 2:30:59.880
 what you're good at, not be full of yourself,

2:30:59.880 --> 2:31:02.080
 like truly look at your track record.

2:31:03.720 --> 2:31:07.400
 What's the saying like, it ain't bragging if you can do it.

2:31:09.200 --> 2:31:12.280
 But too many people are delusional

2:31:12.280 --> 2:31:14.280
 and like think they're better at things

2:31:14.280 --> 2:31:15.480
 than they actually are,

2:31:15.480 --> 2:31:18.640
 or think there's a bigger market than there actually is.

2:31:18.640 --> 2:31:21.080
 When you confuse your passion for things with a big market,

2:31:21.080 --> 2:31:23.600
 that's really scary, right?

2:31:23.600 --> 2:31:25.000
 Like just because you think it's cool

2:31:25.000 --> 2:31:27.120
 doesn't mean that it's a big business opportunity.

2:31:27.120 --> 2:31:28.760
 So like, what evidence do you have?

2:31:28.760 --> 2:31:32.600
 Again, I'm a fairly like, I'm a strict rationalist on this.

2:31:32.600 --> 2:31:35.000
 And like sometimes people don't like working with me

2:31:35.000 --> 2:31:37.160
 because I'm pretty pragmatic about things.

2:31:37.160 --> 2:31:40.440
 Like I'm not Elon, like I don't sit

2:31:40.440 --> 2:31:44.160
 and make bold proclamations about visiting Mars.

2:31:44.160 --> 2:31:46.160
 Like that's just not how I work.

2:31:46.160 --> 2:31:48.480
 I'm like, okay, I want to build this really cool thing

2:31:48.480 --> 2:31:50.840
 that's fairly practical and I think we could do it.

2:31:50.840 --> 2:31:52.320
 And it's in this way.

2:31:52.320 --> 2:31:55.040
 And what's cool though is like, that's just my sweet spot.

2:31:55.040 --> 2:31:58.760
 I'm not like, I just, I can't with a straight face

2:31:58.760 --> 2:31:59.680
 talk about the metaphors.

2:31:59.680 --> 2:32:01.960
 I can't, I just, it's not me.

2:32:01.960 --> 2:32:05.400
 What do you think about the Facebook renaming itself to?

2:32:05.400 --> 2:32:06.440
 I didn't mean that as a dig.

2:32:06.440 --> 2:32:09.440
 I just literally mean like, I'm fairly,

2:32:09.440 --> 2:32:11.200
 I like to live in the next five years.

2:32:11.200 --> 2:32:13.520
 And like, what things can I get out in a year

2:32:13.520 --> 2:32:15.040
 that people will use at scale?

2:32:15.040 --> 2:32:20.040
 And so it's just, again, those circles I think are different

2:32:20.360 --> 2:32:22.200
 for different people, but it's important to realize

2:32:22.200 --> 2:32:26.040
 that like market matters, you being good at it matters

2:32:26.040 --> 2:32:27.960
 and having passion for it matters.

2:32:27.960 --> 2:32:29.440
 Your question, sorry.

2:32:29.440 --> 2:32:33.760
 Well, on that last, on this topic in terms of funding,

2:32:33.760 --> 2:32:36.480
 is there, by way of advice,

2:32:39.200 --> 2:32:44.200
 was funding in your own journey helpful, unhelpful?

2:32:44.840 --> 2:32:48.360
 Like is there a right time to get funding, venture funding

2:32:48.360 --> 2:32:51.120
 or anything, borrow some money from your parents?

2:32:51.120 --> 2:32:51.960
 I don't know.

2:32:51.960 --> 2:32:54.880
 Like is money getting in the way?

2:32:54.880 --> 2:32:56.040
 Does it help?

2:32:56.040 --> 2:32:57.440
 Is the timing important?

2:32:57.440 --> 2:33:00.280
 Is there some kind of wisdom you can give there

2:33:00.280 --> 2:33:02.960
 because you were exceptionally successful very quickly?

2:33:06.480 --> 2:33:09.720
 Funding helps as long as it's from the right people.

2:33:09.720 --> 2:33:10.640
 That includes yourself.

2:33:10.640 --> 2:33:13.640
 And I'll talk about myself funding myself in a second,

2:33:13.640 --> 2:33:15.800
 which is like, because I can fund myself

2:33:15.800 --> 2:33:18.000
 doing whatever projects I can do,

2:33:18.000 --> 2:33:20.600
 I don't really have another person putting pressure on me

2:33:20.600 --> 2:33:24.440
 except for myself and that creates strange dynamics, right?

2:33:24.440 --> 2:33:27.080
 But let's like talk about people getting funding

2:33:27.080 --> 2:33:28.960
 from a venture capitalist initially.

2:33:30.440 --> 2:33:32.480
 We raised money from Matt Kohler at Benchmark.

2:33:32.480 --> 2:33:36.480
 He's brilliant, amazing guy, very thoughtful.

2:33:36.480 --> 2:33:39.440
 And he was very helpful early on.

2:33:39.440 --> 2:33:41.080
 But I have stories from entrepreneurs

2:33:41.080 --> 2:33:42.880
 where they raised money from the wrong person

2:33:42.880 --> 2:33:45.920
 or the wrong firm where incentives weren't aligned.

2:33:46.760 --> 2:33:48.600
 They didn't think in the same way

2:33:48.600 --> 2:33:51.320
 and bad things happened because of that.

2:33:51.320 --> 2:33:53.480
 The boardroom was always noisy.

2:33:53.480 --> 2:33:55.520
 There were fights, like we just never had that.

2:33:55.520 --> 2:33:57.080
 Matt was great.

2:33:57.080 --> 2:33:59.880
 I think like capital these days

2:33:59.880 --> 2:34:01.720
 is kind of a dime a dozen, right?

2:34:01.720 --> 2:34:03.120
 Like as long as you're fundable,

2:34:03.120 --> 2:34:05.080
 like it seems like there's money out there

2:34:05.080 --> 2:34:06.520
 is what I'm hearing.

2:34:08.120 --> 2:34:10.400
 It's really important that you are aligned

2:34:10.400 --> 2:34:12.000
 and that you think of raising money

2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:15.000
 as hiring someone for your team rather than taking money

2:34:15.920 --> 2:34:18.320
 if capital is plentiful, right?

2:34:18.320 --> 2:34:20.880
 It provides a certain amount of pressure

2:34:20.880 --> 2:34:23.080
 to do the right thing that I think is healthy

2:34:23.080 --> 2:34:24.120
 for any startup.

2:34:24.120 --> 2:34:25.720
 And it keeps you real and honest

2:34:25.720 --> 2:34:27.400
 because they don't wanna lose their money.

2:34:27.400 --> 2:34:29.640
 They're paid to not lose their money.

2:34:29.640 --> 2:34:32.720
 The problem, maybe I could depersonalize it,

2:34:32.720 --> 2:34:35.800
 but like I remember having lunch with Elon.

2:34:35.800 --> 2:34:37.640
 It's only happened once.

2:34:37.640 --> 2:34:39.960
 And I asked him, like I was trying to figure out

2:34:39.960 --> 2:34:42.560
 what I was doing after Instagram, right?

2:34:42.560 --> 2:34:44.880
 And I asked him something about like angel investing.

2:34:44.880 --> 2:34:46.320
 And he looked at me with a straight face.

2:34:46.320 --> 2:34:48.120
 He was like, why the F would I do that?

2:34:48.120 --> 2:34:48.960
 Like, why?

2:34:48.960 --> 2:34:50.760
 I was like, I don't know.

2:34:50.760 --> 2:34:51.600
 Like you're connected.

2:34:51.600 --> 2:34:54.760
 Like seems like he's like, I only invest in myself.

2:34:54.760 --> 2:34:56.880
 I was like, Ooh, okay.

2:34:56.880 --> 2:34:59.240
 You know, like not the confidence.

2:34:59.240 --> 2:35:00.880
 I was just like, what a novel idea.

2:35:00.880 --> 2:35:03.080
 It's like, yeah, if you have money,

2:35:03.080 --> 2:35:06.000
 like why not just put it against your bag

2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:11.000
 and like enable you're visiting Mars or something, right?

2:35:11.160 --> 2:35:12.800
 Like that's awesome, great.

2:35:12.800 --> 2:35:14.920
 But I had never really thought of it that way.

2:35:14.920 --> 2:35:17.600
 But also with that comes an interesting dynamic

2:35:17.600 --> 2:35:22.200
 where you don't actually have people

2:35:22.200 --> 2:35:23.920
 who are gonna lose that money telling you,

2:35:23.920 --> 2:35:27.000
 hey, don't do this or, hey, you need to face this reality.

2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:31.000
 So you need to create other versions of that truth teller.

2:35:32.560 --> 2:35:34.560
 And whatever I do next,

2:35:34.560 --> 2:35:36.720
 that's gonna be one of the interesting challenges

2:35:36.720 --> 2:35:40.640
 is how do you create that truth telling situation?

2:35:40.640 --> 2:35:41.720
 And that's part of why, by the way,

2:35:41.720 --> 2:35:43.800
 I think someone like Jack, when you start Square,

2:35:43.800 --> 2:35:46.800
 you have money, but you still, you bring on partners

2:35:46.800 --> 2:35:48.680
 because I think it creates

2:35:48.680 --> 2:35:51.400
 a truth telling type environment.

2:35:51.400 --> 2:35:52.440
 I'm still trying to figure this out.

2:35:52.440 --> 2:35:56.440
 Like it's an interesting dynamic.

2:35:56.440 --> 2:35:59.840
 So you're thinking of perhaps launching some kind of venture

2:35:59.840 --> 2:36:01.720
 where you're investing in yourself?

2:36:01.720 --> 2:36:06.440
 I mean, I'm 37 going on 38 next month.

2:36:06.440 --> 2:36:07.840
 I have a long life to live.

2:36:07.840 --> 2:36:10.720
 I'm definitely not gonna sit on the beach, right?

2:36:10.720 --> 2:36:13.520
 So I'm gonna do something at some point

2:36:13.520 --> 2:36:18.200
 and I gotta imagine I will like help fund it, right?

2:36:18.200 --> 2:36:20.040
 So the other way of thinking about this

2:36:20.040 --> 2:36:21.760
 is you can park your money in the SMP,

2:36:21.760 --> 2:36:22.600
 and this is bad

2:36:22.600 --> 2:36:26.000
 because the SMP has done wonderfully well last year, right?

2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:27.520
 Or you can invest in yourself.

2:36:27.520 --> 2:36:30.800
 And if you're not gonna invest in yourself,

2:36:30.800 --> 2:36:32.120
 you probably shouldn't do a startup.

2:36:32.120 --> 2:36:34.160
 It's kind of the way of thinking about it.

2:36:35.800 --> 2:36:37.760
 And you can invest in yourself in the way Elon does,

2:36:37.760 --> 2:36:41.320
 which is basically go all in on this investment.

2:36:41.320 --> 2:36:43.320
 Maybe that's one way to achieve accountability

2:36:43.320 --> 2:36:46.360
 is like you're kind of screwed if you fail.

2:36:46.360 --> 2:36:49.960
 Yeah, that's, yeah.

2:36:49.960 --> 2:36:50.800
 I personally like that.

2:36:50.800 --> 2:36:52.640
 I like burning bridges behind me

2:36:52.640 --> 2:36:54.920
 so that I'm fucked if it fails.

2:36:57.360 --> 2:36:58.840
 It's really important though.

2:37:00.480 --> 2:37:03.680
 One of the things I think Mark said to me early on

2:37:03.680 --> 2:37:06.320
 that sticks with me that I think is true.

2:37:06.320 --> 2:37:07.560
 We were talking about people

2:37:07.560 --> 2:37:10.480
 who had left like operating roles

2:37:10.480 --> 2:37:11.680
 and started doing venture or something.

2:37:11.680 --> 2:37:13.360
 He was like, a lot of people convince themselves

2:37:13.360 --> 2:37:14.320
 they work really hard.

2:37:14.320 --> 2:37:15.800
 Like they think they work really hard

2:37:15.800 --> 2:37:17.480
 and they put on the show

2:37:17.480 --> 2:37:19.400
 and in their minds they work really hard,

2:37:19.400 --> 2:37:20.920
 but they don't work very hard.

2:37:22.120 --> 2:37:24.880
 There is something about lighting a fire underneath you

2:37:24.880 --> 2:37:28.240
 and burning bridges such that you can't turn back.

2:37:28.240 --> 2:37:31.200
 That I think, we didn't talk about this specifically,

2:37:31.200 --> 2:37:32.360
 but I think you're right.

2:37:32.360 --> 2:37:34.920
 There is, you need to have that

2:37:34.920 --> 2:37:38.240
 because there's the self delusion at a certain scale.

2:37:39.360 --> 2:37:40.920
 Oh, I have so many board calls.

2:37:40.920 --> 2:37:43.120
 Oh, like we have all these things to figure out.

2:37:43.120 --> 2:37:45.960
 It's like, this is one of the hard parts

2:37:45.960 --> 2:37:47.320
 about it being an operator.

2:37:47.320 --> 2:37:50.160
 It's like, there are so many people

2:37:50.160 --> 2:37:52.760
 that have made a lot of money not operating,

2:37:52.760 --> 2:37:55.400
 but operating is just one of the hardest things on earth.

2:37:55.400 --> 2:37:58.160
 It is just so effing hard.

2:37:58.160 --> 2:37:59.320
 It is stressful.

2:37:59.320 --> 2:38:01.440
 It is, you're dealing with real humans,

2:38:01.440 --> 2:38:04.800
 not just like throwing capital in and hoping it grows.

2:38:04.800 --> 2:38:06.720
 I'm not undermining the VC mindset.

2:38:06.720 --> 2:38:08.480
 I think it's a wonderful thing and needed

2:38:08.480 --> 2:38:11.520
 and so many wonderful VCs I've worked with.

2:38:11.520 --> 2:38:14.760
 But yeah, like when your ass is on the line

2:38:14.760 --> 2:38:16.520
 and it's your money, it's...

2:38:18.560 --> 2:38:21.720
 Talk to me in 10 years, we'll see how it goes.

2:38:21.720 --> 2:38:23.440
 Yeah, but like you were saying, that is a source.

2:38:23.440 --> 2:38:24.680
 When you wake up in the morning

2:38:24.680 --> 2:38:28.880
 and you look forward to the day full of challenges,

2:38:28.880 --> 2:38:31.040
 that's also where you can find happiness.

2:38:31.040 --> 2:38:32.760
 Let me ask you about love and friendship.

2:38:32.760 --> 2:38:33.600
 Sure.

2:38:33.600 --> 2:38:36.680
 What's the role in this heck of a difficult journey

2:38:36.680 --> 2:38:41.680
 you have been on of love, of friendship?

2:38:41.680 --> 2:38:44.080
 What's the role of love in the human condition?

2:38:45.680 --> 2:38:47.280
 Well, first things first,

2:38:47.280 --> 2:38:49.480
 the woman I married, my wife, Nicole,

2:38:49.480 --> 2:38:53.840
 there's no way I could do what I do if we weren't together.

2:38:53.840 --> 2:38:55.120
 She had the filter idea.

2:38:55.120 --> 2:38:56.680
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

2:38:56.680 --> 2:38:58.080
 We didn't go over that story.

2:38:59.360 --> 2:39:01.480
 Everything is a partnership, right?

2:39:01.480 --> 2:39:03.840
 And to achieve great things,

2:39:03.840 --> 2:39:06.480
 it's not about like someone pulling their weight in places.

2:39:06.480 --> 2:39:08.840
 Like it's not like someone's supporting you

2:39:08.840 --> 2:39:11.160
 so that you could do this other thing.

2:39:11.160 --> 2:39:12.560
 It's literally like,

2:39:14.440 --> 2:39:18.920
 Mike and I and our partnership as cofounders is fascinating

2:39:18.920 --> 2:39:20.440
 because I don't think Instagram would have happened

2:39:20.440 --> 2:39:21.920
 without that partnership.

2:39:21.920 --> 2:39:25.800
 Like either him or me alone, no way.

2:39:25.800 --> 2:39:28.600
 We pushed and pulled each other in a way

2:39:28.600 --> 2:39:32.360
 that allowed us to build a better thing because of it.

2:39:32.360 --> 2:39:35.840
 Nicole, she pushed me to work on the filters early on.

2:39:35.840 --> 2:39:36.760
 And yes, that's exciting.

2:39:36.760 --> 2:39:38.560
 It's a fun story, right?

2:39:38.560 --> 2:39:41.920
 But the truth of it is being able to like level

2:39:41.920 --> 2:39:44.720
 with someone about how hard the process is

2:39:44.720 --> 2:39:49.320
 and have someone see you for who you are before Instagram

2:39:49.320 --> 2:39:53.240
 and know that there's a constant you throughout all of this

2:39:53.240 --> 2:39:55.960
 and be able to call you when you're drifting from that,

2:39:55.960 --> 2:39:58.360
 but also support you when you're trying to stick with that.

2:39:58.360 --> 2:40:02.920
 That's, I mean, that's true friendship slash love,

2:40:02.920 --> 2:40:04.320
 whatever you want to call it.

2:40:04.320 --> 2:40:07.120
 But also it was for someone not to care.

2:40:07.120 --> 2:40:08.600
 I remember Nicole saying,

2:40:08.600 --> 2:40:10.480
 hey, like I know you're going to do this Instagram thing.

2:40:10.480 --> 2:40:12.880
 You should, I guess it was bourbon at the time.

2:40:12.880 --> 2:40:15.720
 You should do it because, you know,

2:40:15.720 --> 2:40:16.840
 even if it doesn't work,

2:40:16.840 --> 2:40:20.160
 we can move to like a smaller apartment and it'll be fine.

2:40:20.160 --> 2:40:21.360
 Like we'll make it work.

2:40:22.360 --> 2:40:24.200
 How beautiful is that, right?

2:40:24.200 --> 2:40:25.720
 That's almost like a superpower

2:40:25.720 --> 2:40:27.640
 that gives you permission to fail.

2:40:27.640 --> 2:40:29.760
 And somehow that actually leads to success.

2:40:29.760 --> 2:40:31.760
 But also she's like the least impressed

2:40:31.760 --> 2:40:33.520
 about Instagram of anyone.

2:40:33.520 --> 2:40:34.760
 She's like, yeah, it's great.

2:40:34.760 --> 2:40:36.200
 But like, I love you for you.

2:40:36.200 --> 2:40:38.000
 Like, I like that you're like a decent cook.

2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:39.520
 That's beautiful.

2:40:39.520 --> 2:40:42.720
 That's beautiful with the Gantt chart and Thanksgiving,

2:40:42.720 --> 2:40:44.880
 which I still think is a brilliant effing idea.

2:40:44.880 --> 2:40:46.240
 Thank you.

2:40:46.240 --> 2:40:48.280
 Big, ridiculous question.

2:40:48.280 --> 2:40:53.040
 Have you, you're old and wise at this stage.

2:40:53.040 --> 2:40:55.480
 So have you discovered meaning to this whole thing?

2:40:55.480 --> 2:40:59.600
 Why the hell are we descendants of apes here on earth?

2:40:59.600 --> 2:41:00.680
 What's the meaning of it?

2:41:00.680 --> 2:41:01.960
 What's the meaning of life?

2:41:01.960 --> 2:41:02.920
 I haven't.

2:41:02.920 --> 2:41:06.040
 And I am, so the crazy,

2:41:06.040 --> 2:41:09.280
 so the best learning for me has been like,

2:41:09.280 --> 2:41:12.600
 no matter what level of success you achieve,

2:41:12.600 --> 2:41:14.840
 you're still worried about similar things,

2:41:14.840 --> 2:41:16.320
 just maybe on a slightly different scale.

2:41:16.320 --> 2:41:18.920
 You're still concerned about the same thing.

2:41:18.920 --> 2:41:21.120
 You're still self conscious about the same things.

2:41:21.120 --> 2:41:26.120
 Just like, and actually that moment going through that

2:41:26.680 --> 2:41:29.000
 is what makes you believe there's gotta be like

2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:31.720
 more machinery to life or purpose to life.

2:41:31.720 --> 2:41:35.240
 And that we're all chasing these materialistic things,

2:41:35.240 --> 2:41:38.200
 but you start realizing like,

2:41:38.200 --> 2:41:39.760
 it's almost like, you know, the Truman Show

2:41:39.760 --> 2:41:42.920
 when he gets to the edge and he like knocks against it.

2:41:42.920 --> 2:41:43.760
 He's like, what?

2:41:43.760 --> 2:41:45.840
 Like there's this awakening that happens

2:41:45.840 --> 2:41:47.640
 when you get to that edge that you realize,

2:41:47.640 --> 2:41:49.640
 oh, like sure, it's great.

2:41:49.640 --> 2:41:53.760
 It's great that we all chase money and fame and success.

2:41:53.760 --> 2:41:56.120
 But you hit the edge and I'm not even claiming

2:41:56.120 --> 2:41:58.240
 I hit an edge like Elon's hit an edge.

2:41:58.240 --> 2:42:00.000
 Like there's clearly larger scales.

2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:02.360
 But what's cool is you learn that,

2:42:02.360 --> 2:42:03.840
 like it doesn't actually matter

2:42:03.840 --> 2:42:07.200
 and that there are all these other things that truly matter.

2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:09.280
 That's not a case for working less hard.

2:42:09.280 --> 2:42:11.480
 That's not a case for taking it easy.

2:42:11.480 --> 2:42:13.920
 That's not a case for the four day work week.

2:42:13.920 --> 2:42:16.640
 What that is a case for is designing your life

2:42:16.640 --> 2:42:18.960
 exactly the way you want to design it.

2:42:18.960 --> 2:42:22.440
 Cause I don't know, I think we go around the earth,

2:42:22.440 --> 2:42:25.040
 you know, the sun a certain number of times

2:42:25.040 --> 2:42:27.640
 and then we die and then that's it.

2:42:27.640 --> 2:42:28.520
 That's me.

2:42:28.520 --> 2:42:30.200
 Are you afraid of that moment?

2:42:30.200 --> 2:42:31.040
 No, not at all.

2:42:31.040 --> 2:42:32.800
 In fact, or at least not yet.

2:42:36.200 --> 2:42:39.560
 Listen, I'm like a pilot, like I do crazy things

2:42:39.560 --> 2:42:43.440
 and I like, no, I like, if anything, I'm like,

2:42:43.440 --> 2:42:48.440
 oh, I got to choose mindfully and purposefully

2:42:49.640 --> 2:42:54.080
 the thing I am doing right now and not just fall into it

2:42:54.080 --> 2:42:55.800
 because you're going to wake up one day and ask yourself

2:42:55.800 --> 2:42:58.400
 why the hell you spent the last 10 years doing X, Y or Z?

2:42:58.400 --> 2:42:59.240
 Yeah.

2:42:59.240 --> 2:43:03.720
 So I guess my like shorter answer to this is

2:43:03.720 --> 2:43:08.320
 doing things on purpose because you choose to do them.

2:43:08.320 --> 2:43:11.640
 So important in life and not just like floating

2:43:11.640 --> 2:43:14.680
 down the river of life, hitting branches along the way

2:43:14.680 --> 2:43:17.160
 cause you will hit branches, right?

2:43:17.160 --> 2:43:19.680
 But rather like literally plotting a course

2:43:19.680 --> 2:43:21.080
 and not having a 10 year plan,

2:43:21.080 --> 2:43:23.740
 but just choosing every day to opt in.

2:43:23.740 --> 2:43:28.540
 That I think has been more like,

2:43:28.540 --> 2:43:29.900
 I haven't figured out the meaning of life

2:43:29.900 --> 2:43:31.620
 by any stretch of the imagination,

2:43:31.620 --> 2:43:33.820
 but it certainly isn't money and it certainly isn't fame

2:43:33.820 --> 2:43:35.080
 and it certainly isn't travel.

2:43:35.080 --> 2:43:37.740
 And it's like, and it's way more of like opting

2:43:37.740 --> 2:43:39.400
 into the game you love playing.

2:43:40.260 --> 2:43:41.980
 Every day opting in.

2:43:41.980 --> 2:43:44.820
 Just opting in and like, don't let it happen.

2:43:44.820 --> 2:43:45.760
 You opt in.

2:43:46.920 --> 2:43:51.920
 Kevin, it's great to end on love and the meaning of life.

2:43:51.920 --> 2:43:53.920
 This was an amazing conversation.

2:43:53.920 --> 2:43:54.760
 It was a lot of fun, thank you.

2:43:54.760 --> 2:43:57.880
 You gave me like a light into some fascinating aspects

2:43:57.880 --> 2:44:00.160
 of this technical world.

2:44:00.160 --> 2:44:04.040
 And I can't honestly wait to see what you do next.

2:44:04.040 --> 2:44:05.280
 Thank you so much.

2:44:05.280 --> 2:44:06.320
 Thanks for having me.

2:44:07.380 --> 2:44:09.040
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:44:09.040 --> 2:44:10.480
