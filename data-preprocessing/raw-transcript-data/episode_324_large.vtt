00:00.000 --> 00:02.180
 you could be the seventh best player in the whole world,

00:02.180 --> 00:03.900
 like literally seventh best player.

00:03.900 --> 00:07.940
 But if you're playing with the other six, you're the sucker.

00:07.940 --> 00:10.820
 You are like the worst player in the game, right?

00:10.820 --> 00:13.580
 So like there's a lot of players, for example,

00:13.580 --> 00:15.420
 like the Dan Blazarians of the world, right?

00:15.420 --> 00:17.580
 He's not a top level player,

00:17.580 --> 00:19.500
 like these guys you see on TV,

00:19.500 --> 00:21.620
 but he probably makes more money than they do

00:21.620 --> 00:23.040
 because he plays with people

00:23.040 --> 00:24.660
 that are far below his skill level.

00:24.660 --> 00:27.220
 So part of the skill of being a poker player

00:27.220 --> 00:30.600
 is finding situations where you're profitable,

00:30.600 --> 00:32.100
 regardless of your skill level.

00:34.360 --> 00:37.580
 The following is a conversation with Daniel Negrano,

00:37.580 --> 00:40.520
 one of the greatest poker players of all time.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.440
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.460
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:44.460 --> 00:45.700
 in the description.

00:45.700 --> 00:49.280
 And now, dear friends, here's Daniel Negrano.

00:50.180 --> 00:52.060
 Everything everyone does at the poker table

00:52.060 --> 00:53.220
 conveys information.

00:53.220 --> 00:56.460
 So let me ask sort of the big overview question.

00:56.460 --> 00:59.060
 What are the various sources of information

00:59.060 --> 01:02.300
 that you project and others project at the table

01:02.300 --> 01:03.980
 that convey information?

01:03.980 --> 01:05.220
 Well, there's several different things.

01:05.220 --> 01:06.560
 There's the ones that are conscious

01:06.560 --> 01:08.680
 and then there's the ones that are subconscious, right?

01:08.680 --> 01:09.880
 Like on the conscious level,

01:09.880 --> 01:11.940
 it might be something someone says, right?

01:11.940 --> 01:13.780
 You know, you ask them a question and they say,

01:13.780 --> 01:15.980
 oh, you know, you shouldn't call me here, you should.

01:15.980 --> 01:17.440
 So there's the verbal tells.

01:17.440 --> 01:20.140
 There's also the more, you know, subconscious stuff,

01:20.140 --> 01:21.860
 body posture, right?

01:21.860 --> 01:24.820
 The eyes, the throat, the pulse,

01:24.820 --> 01:27.900
 various things that are, you know, less controllable.

01:27.900 --> 01:30.040
 I find I use a combination of both

01:30.040 --> 01:31.580
 to try to gain information,

01:31.580 --> 01:34.840
 but generally when I have somebody more comfortable,

01:34.840 --> 01:36.360
 they give off more.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.700
 Like everyone has a different approach.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.540
 Phil Ivey likes to intimidate.

01:39.540 --> 01:40.420
 I go the other way.

01:40.420 --> 01:42.700
 I want my opponents to be relaxed

01:42.700 --> 01:44.580
 so that they'll give me more in that regard.

01:44.580 --> 01:47.260
 So Phil Ivey likes to perturb the system,

01:47.260 --> 01:50.500
 like mess with it to see what comes out.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.460
 I think Phil has an aura about him

01:52.460 --> 01:55.820
 where he wants you to know that he's watching you,

01:55.820 --> 01:58.020
 be afraid, be uncomfortable,

01:58.020 --> 02:00.780
 because when you're uncomfortable, I got you, right?

02:00.780 --> 02:03.100
 And that's sort of his shtick where he, you know,

02:03.100 --> 02:05.700
 and people do, like when you sit at a table with Phil Ivey,

02:05.700 --> 02:06.540
 it's intimidating.

02:06.540 --> 02:07.780
 He likes to rule by fear

02:07.780 --> 02:10.040
 and you like to rule by, what is it, love?

02:10.040 --> 02:11.220
 That's a really good way to put it.

02:11.220 --> 02:12.740
 I never had anyone put it like that,

02:12.740 --> 02:13.640
 but it makes a lot of sense.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.500
 Yeah, you know, fear Phil Ivey,

02:15.500 --> 02:17.220
 and then with me, it's fine, don't worry,

02:17.220 --> 02:18.940
 I'll take your money, but you're gonna enjoy it.

02:18.940 --> 02:19.820
 It's great.

02:19.820 --> 02:21.820
 So that's what the talking at the table is about,

02:21.820 --> 02:26.820
 is getting to be relaxed and get some of that gray area

02:26.820 --> 02:28.420
 between the conscious and the subconscious

02:28.420 --> 02:29.380
 to reveal something.

02:29.380 --> 02:31.140
 Yeah, there's that too, and also just, you know,

02:31.140 --> 02:32.680
 and this is just part of who I am anyway,

02:32.680 --> 02:34.060
 like I like to talk to people,

02:34.060 --> 02:36.540
 but one of the byproducts is the more I know about you,

02:36.540 --> 02:38.280
 the more I likely know about how you think

02:38.280 --> 02:39.720
 about different situations, right?

02:39.720 --> 02:40.580
 So what do you do for a living?

02:40.580 --> 02:42.980
 Oh, I'm a lawyer, I defend criminals.

02:42.980 --> 02:45.540
 Okay, so this guy probably spends a lot of his time

02:45.540 --> 02:47.820
 twisting the truth, trying to find, you know,

02:47.820 --> 02:50.340
 and then, so then, you know, you already have a mindset

02:50.340 --> 02:52.020
 of like, this guy might be more likely to bluff

02:52.020 --> 02:53.620
 or he's probably comfortable doing that.

02:53.620 --> 02:55.300
 Very subtle things like that.

02:55.300 --> 03:00.040
 And you start to pick up cues on what nervousness looks like

03:00.040 --> 03:02.780
 for this person, what the nervousness communicates,

03:02.780 --> 03:03.620
 all that kind of stuff.

03:03.620 --> 03:05.620
 So we're talking about physical tells here.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.460
 Yeah, physical tells is a secondary thing.

03:07.460 --> 03:10.500
 I was more specific like player profiling, right?

03:10.500 --> 03:12.180
 And sort of understanding the type of mind

03:12.180 --> 03:14.300
 that I'm dealing with, right?

03:14.300 --> 03:17.900
 So again, somebody who's a lawyer is used to trying,

03:17.900 --> 03:21.420
 is fine with being deceptive as part of a game, right?

03:21.420 --> 03:23.800
 Whereas maybe somebody who's a Sunday school teacher

03:23.800 --> 03:25.820
 and, you know, they don't feel comfortable,

03:25.820 --> 03:28.540
 maybe they think bluffing might be dishonest, right?

03:28.540 --> 03:31.540
 So they're less likely to try some shenanigans against you.

03:31.540 --> 03:33.340
 So, and then the other thing too is,

03:33.340 --> 03:38.340
 what type of person is this in terms of their, you know,

03:38.740 --> 03:40.060
 like view on life, right?

03:40.060 --> 03:40.900
 Are they positive?

03:40.900 --> 03:44.040
 Do they feel like things go their way or they're not, right?

03:44.040 --> 03:46.420
 There's those people that always, well, of course I lost,

03:46.420 --> 03:47.980
 I always lose with this hand.

03:47.980 --> 03:50.220
 And those types of people you can manipulate

03:50.220 --> 03:52.020
 because when a card comes,

03:52.020 --> 03:54.700
 that you don't have them beat, right?

03:54.700 --> 03:56.540
 But you can pretend because they'll believe it.

03:56.540 --> 03:57.580
 Like, of course you beat me.

03:57.580 --> 03:59.220
 So you bet all your chips against them,

03:59.220 --> 04:00.600
 knowing that you can scare them

04:00.600 --> 04:03.780
 because they already feel like they're gonna lose.

04:03.780 --> 04:05.980
 The inherent, like the cynicism.

04:05.980 --> 04:06.820
 Exactly.

04:06.820 --> 04:08.360
 Cynicism is easier to play against

04:08.360 --> 04:10.740
 because you can convince them that their cards suck.

04:10.740 --> 04:12.660
 Yeah, when somebody believes that they're a loser

04:12.660 --> 04:14.140
 or they're unlucky, right?

04:14.140 --> 04:16.100
 And that bad things happen to them always

04:16.100 --> 04:17.540
 and they never catch a break.

04:17.540 --> 04:20.540
 Well, you know, you can just help them make it true.

04:21.980 --> 04:24.900
 What do you think about the rounders Teddy KGB

04:24.900 --> 04:26.980
 when he does the Oreo tell?

04:26.980 --> 04:30.220
 Do players at the high level communicate that kind of stuff?

04:30.220 --> 04:31.940
 Do you think it's realistic to be able to have a tell

04:31.940 --> 04:34.460
 like this that's partially subconscious?

04:34.460 --> 04:37.420
 So first of all, I love Brian Koppelman who made the film.

04:37.420 --> 04:39.380
 And I think what they were going for

04:39.380 --> 04:41.900
 is something obvious to the general public, right?

04:41.900 --> 04:44.020
 Like, okay, it's very clear, you know, he eats the cookie,

04:44.020 --> 04:46.060
 he doesn't eat the cookie and it means one or the other.

04:46.060 --> 04:50.060
 At the highest levels, something that, you know, blatant,

04:50.060 --> 04:51.000
 you're not gonna find.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.540
 You're gonna find a lot more subtle things,

04:52.540 --> 04:55.420
 maybe with posture or timing or, you know,

04:55.420 --> 04:56.380
 different things like that.

04:56.380 --> 05:00.340
 But at the lower levels, you know, you might see some,

05:00.340 --> 05:02.340
 you might see, you know, with a lot of people

05:02.340 --> 05:03.940
 when they're in a hand and they've bet,

05:03.940 --> 05:06.100
 whether they drink water in the hand

05:06.100 --> 05:08.220
 is going to tell you something generally speaking.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.980
 It's such an intimate part of the human experience

05:09.980 --> 05:11.340
 that I feel like if you have food,

05:11.340 --> 05:13.160
 you're gonna reveal something about yourself

05:13.160 --> 05:14.340
 through the way you eat.

05:14.340 --> 05:15.620
 I feel like that's a dangerous thing

05:15.620 --> 05:16.460
 to have at the table.

05:16.460 --> 05:18.260
 Well, the thing is, generally speaking,

05:18.260 --> 05:20.120
 people don't eat food in the middle of a hand.

05:20.120 --> 05:23.100
 Like they're not gonna bet and then just like grab a burger.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.620
 What they will do though is, you know,

05:24.620 --> 05:26.720
 they bet and it's up to you and then they're,

05:26.720 --> 05:28.280
 whether they're, you know, uncomfortable

05:28.280 --> 05:29.240
 or they do it unconsciously,

05:29.240 --> 05:30.980
 they just want to do something

05:30.980 --> 05:32.820
 to make themselves look relaxed or whatever.

05:32.820 --> 05:34.420
 And then, you know, they grab a water

05:34.420 --> 05:35.900
 where they don't really need it in that moment,

05:35.900 --> 05:39.180
 but they're trying to take your mind off of the situation.

05:39.180 --> 05:43.660
 So they, in the movie, wanted to show a simplistic version

05:43.660 --> 05:45.180
 of something that does happen,

05:45.180 --> 05:48.340
 something that's visually sort of clear.

05:48.340 --> 05:50.760
 Yeah, because I think one of the things Rounders got right

05:50.760 --> 05:52.340
 is that it's a poker movie, right?

05:52.340 --> 05:54.100
 But you don't have to be great at poker

05:54.100 --> 05:56.140
 or really understand poker to enjoy the movie.

05:56.140 --> 05:58.220
 And that, you know, Oreo cookie tale,

05:58.220 --> 05:59.820
 like everyone gets that.

05:59.820 --> 06:01.180
 They're like, okay, that's simple.

06:01.180 --> 06:03.180
 If he would have went with something more subtle,

06:03.180 --> 06:06.600
 you know, like licking your lips or looking to the right,

06:06.600 --> 06:09.020
 or I think it might've been lost on the audience.

06:09.020 --> 06:12.120
 And they didn't actually explicitly say

06:12.120 --> 06:14.940
 that that was a tell, I don't think.

06:14.940 --> 06:17.700
 I thought they did everything to let you know, right?

06:17.700 --> 06:21.340
 With the music and slow motion and he's staring at it

06:21.340 --> 06:22.620
 and he's like, aha.

06:22.620 --> 06:25.060
 Yeah, but they didn't actually say,

06:25.060 --> 06:26.620
 you know, this is an obvious tell,

06:26.620 --> 06:28.500
 like Matt Damon's character didn't talk.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.940
 At the very end of it, you know,

06:29.940 --> 06:33.500
 after he says, how the fuck did you lay that down?

06:33.500 --> 06:34.620
 The monster, right?

06:34.620 --> 06:37.900
 And he's like, he's like, you're not hungry?

06:37.900 --> 06:38.740
 Not hungry, KGB?

06:38.740 --> 06:40.300
 He's like, I keep on, but you, you know,

06:40.300 --> 06:42.700
 so he sort of references it and then he takes the cookies.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.500
 He notices, he's like, ah, he got me.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.140
 And he breaks the, you know, the rack of cookies.

06:46.140 --> 06:48.420
 Well, probably if you had that kind of tell on him,

06:48.420 --> 06:51.540
 you wouldn't, and Matt Damon's character would not reveal.

06:51.540 --> 06:53.420
 Well, he says in the movie, he says,

06:53.420 --> 06:54.820
 normally I wouldn't reveal a tell,

06:54.820 --> 06:56.620
 but I don't have that much time.

06:56.620 --> 06:58.460
 Like I've got to rattle him some way.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.620
 So that was one way to do that.

07:00.620 --> 07:05.000
 How hard is it to do that to, in a KGB accent,

07:05.900 --> 07:08.340
 to lay down a monster in those situations?

07:08.340 --> 07:10.820
 In general, how hard is it to lay down

07:10.820 --> 07:13.260
 a really strong hand, just psychologically?

07:13.260 --> 07:15.140
 Yeah, no, I mean, I think it's incredibly difficult

07:15.140 --> 07:16.680
 for the vast majority of people.

07:16.680 --> 07:18.180
 You know, part of what makes professionals

07:18.180 --> 07:20.660
 really, really good is recognizing a situation

07:20.660 --> 07:22.860
 that's very, very dangerous and they need to, you know,

07:22.860 --> 07:23.700
 jump ship.

07:23.700 --> 07:25.260
 Like what happens to a lot of players

07:25.260 --> 07:26.540
 is you get married to a hand.

07:26.540 --> 07:27.900
 Let's say you have pocket aces,

07:27.900 --> 07:29.780
 which is the best possible hand, right?

07:29.780 --> 07:32.900
 But the board runs out where it's seven, eight, nine,

07:32.900 --> 07:34.700
 and then there's a jack and then there's a six.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.980
 It's like, you have a great hand to start,

07:36.980 --> 07:37.860
 but you don't anymore.

07:37.860 --> 07:41.540
 So one of the difficult things for the average player is,

07:41.540 --> 07:44.740
 you know, once they've put money in, cutting their losses

07:44.740 --> 07:46.680
 and saying, okay, let's move on to the next hand.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.180
 It's a very, very difficult thing for a lot of people.

07:48.180 --> 07:52.920
 At every stage of like pre flop all the way through,

07:52.920 --> 07:55.700
 be able to just make a decision at that moment.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.460
 So yeah, essentially not being attached.

07:57.460 --> 08:00.500
 Okay, I've already put in $40,000 in this pot

08:00.500 --> 08:02.260
 and this guy's bet another 20.

08:02.260 --> 08:04.340
 Well, I mean, I gotta get my 40 back, right?

08:04.340 --> 08:07.660
 Except, you know, in some cases you have to reassess

08:07.660 --> 08:09.700
 individually this situation and realize,

08:09.700 --> 08:11.100
 all right, well, this is a bad investment.

08:11.100 --> 08:12.460
 So I got to cut my losses.

08:12.460 --> 08:15.460
 By the way, I should mention that you have,

08:15.460 --> 08:17.020
 you have an incredible YouTube channel

08:17.020 --> 08:18.380
 where you explain a lot of stuff.

08:18.380 --> 08:21.260
 You do a podcast, you do a lot of really awesome stuff.

08:21.260 --> 08:23.660
 My probably favorite thing that you've done

08:23.660 --> 08:27.340
 is your masterclass that people should definitely check out,

08:27.340 --> 08:29.860
 masterclass.com slash Lux.

08:29.860 --> 08:31.500
 There you go.

08:31.500 --> 08:35.600
 No, but it really is one of my favorite masterclass courses,

08:35.600 --> 08:38.580
 but also just a great introduction overview of poker.

08:38.580 --> 08:42.620
 It's great for people like me who are beginners essentially,

08:42.620 --> 08:44.420
 but it's probably really good for intermediate people too.

08:44.420 --> 08:46.460
 I mean, there's a lot of really good detail there.

08:46.460 --> 08:48.860
 Anyway, what are hand ranges

08:48.860 --> 08:51.060
 and how do you begin to estimate the range of hands

08:51.060 --> 08:52.260
 that your opponents have?

08:52.260 --> 08:54.140
 Yeah, so I actually did, speaking to YouTube,

08:54.140 --> 08:55.500
 I did a video on specifically this.

08:55.500 --> 08:56.340
 Yes.

08:56.340 --> 08:57.500
 Getting familiar with Rangers and essentially,

08:57.500 --> 08:58.780
 you know, back in my day, the old days,

08:58.780 --> 09:00.380
 we didn't talk about poker that way.

09:00.380 --> 09:01.540
 We're like, I think he's got this

09:01.540 --> 09:03.980
 or I think he's got that, right?

09:03.980 --> 09:06.100
 Nobody thought of like the range of hands

09:06.100 --> 09:06.940
 a player can have.

09:06.940 --> 09:08.220
 So I guess the best example is,

09:08.220 --> 09:09.820
 imagine like all the potential hands

09:09.820 --> 09:11.820
 as being a part of a grid, right?

09:11.820 --> 09:13.620
 So the first player to act,

09:13.620 --> 09:16.180
 they could have any one of those hands, right?

09:16.180 --> 09:18.100
 Anyone randomly dealt, right?

09:18.100 --> 09:22.140
 But let's say now that that player raised to $3,000.

09:22.140 --> 09:24.580
 Okay, well you can eliminate now from this grid,

09:24.580 --> 09:27.200
 a whole bunch of hands that this player can no longer have

09:27.200 --> 09:28.580
 because if they had a two and a three,

09:28.580 --> 09:29.840
 they wouldn't do that.

09:29.840 --> 09:32.500
 So you can say, okay, he probably has a big pair.

09:32.500 --> 09:33.700
 He has ace king.

09:33.700 --> 09:36.740
 You know, you've narrowed the range of hands down, right?

09:36.740 --> 09:38.980
 Now through every action on the flop,

09:38.980 --> 09:40.180
 on the turn and on the river,

09:40.180 --> 09:41.820
 based on the decisions they make,

09:41.820 --> 09:43.860
 you narrow it down even further.

09:43.860 --> 09:45.860
 So the range of hands is the whole,

09:46.940 --> 09:48.780
 the entirety of all the possibilities

09:48.780 --> 09:50.260
 that this player you believe could have.

09:50.260 --> 09:51.420
 And sometimes they fool you

09:51.420 --> 09:53.220
 or they have a hand that you don't expect them

09:53.220 --> 09:54.280
 to have in their range.

09:54.280 --> 09:56.980
 And you know, maybe a little bit unorthodox

09:56.980 --> 09:59.340
 doing some things you don't expect to throw you off,

09:59.340 --> 10:01.940
 but a range is essentially all the possibilities

10:01.940 --> 10:03.420
 and it narrows as by the time,

10:03.420 --> 10:05.140
 before the flop it's endless,

10:05.140 --> 10:07.260
 player raises, okay, it's minimized.

10:07.260 --> 10:08.420
 You know, a player bets the flop,

10:08.420 --> 10:09.540
 okay, it's minimized further.

10:09.540 --> 10:11.020
 And then by the river, you know,

10:11.020 --> 10:13.900
 you can narrow down the entire range to, you know,

10:13.900 --> 10:15.140
 just maybe even a few hands.

10:15.140 --> 10:17.860
 Is it always shrinking or is there sort of,

10:17.860 --> 10:19.500
 as you get surprised?

10:19.500 --> 10:21.420
 I mean, it's always just an estimate.

10:21.420 --> 10:24.740
 So does it ever expand based on sort of chaotic,

10:24.740 --> 10:29.060
 unpredicted surprising behavior of the players?

10:29.060 --> 10:30.700
 It really should never expand.

10:30.700 --> 10:32.660
 The range of hands should always get smaller, right?

10:32.660 --> 10:35.180
 Like again, we start with the full scope

10:35.180 --> 10:37.020
 and then you should factor in like, okay,

10:37.020 --> 10:37.980
 these are all the possible hands

10:37.980 --> 10:39.960
 you can have on the flop now, right?

10:39.960 --> 10:41.980
 We can't have new hands on the turn.

10:41.980 --> 10:44.260
 And if you get to that point where you think,

10:44.260 --> 10:45.940
 oh, well, maybe he has this hand,

10:45.940 --> 10:49.040
 then you sort of misjudged his range prior.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.460
 So you're not thinking clearly.

10:50.460 --> 10:54.600
 It should always shrink from the full scope to, you know,

10:54.600 --> 10:55.640
 hopefully just a couple.

10:55.640 --> 10:57.660
 Well, in that video, you also talk about,

10:57.660 --> 10:59.780
 it used to be that you would play your hand,

10:59.780 --> 11:02.080
 but now you're playing a range

11:02.080 --> 11:03.580
 that you're representing a range.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.660
 You're not even just playing your hand.

11:05.660 --> 11:08.740
 So what does it mean to represent a certain range?

11:08.740 --> 11:09.940
 Yeah, so that's another big thing

11:09.940 --> 11:11.480
 that's different about poker from, you know,

11:11.480 --> 11:13.860
 my day to today is that back in our day,

11:13.860 --> 11:15.540
 we would like put people on one hand.

11:15.540 --> 11:17.300
 I'm like, you probably have king nine

11:17.300 --> 11:19.220
 or you have jacks or something like that.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.180
 Now people are cognizant of the idea

11:21.180 --> 11:23.020
 that you could have an entire range of hands.

11:23.020 --> 11:24.820
 So then you ask yourself in situations,

11:24.820 --> 11:26.620
 all right, I know what I have,

11:26.620 --> 11:29.140
 but what I could have in his mind

11:29.140 --> 11:31.300
 or my opponent's mind is any one of these hands.

11:31.300 --> 11:34.020
 What would I do with the entirety of these hands?

11:34.020 --> 11:36.260
 And so a lot of people that are trying to play optimally,

11:36.260 --> 11:37.700
 you know, game theory optimal,

11:37.700 --> 11:41.260
 they think in terms of what their range of hands would do

11:41.260 --> 11:43.760
 rather than their very specific hand.

11:43.760 --> 11:46.060
 So is bluffing in that context

11:46.060 --> 11:49.900
 essentially misrepresenting the range of hands that you have?

11:49.900 --> 11:51.160
 No. Is that how you think about it?

11:51.160 --> 11:53.220
 Not exactly, because so an optimal range,

11:53.220 --> 11:54.620
 like if I bet the river,

11:54.620 --> 11:56.620
 if I'm playing game theory optimal,

11:56.620 --> 11:59.040
 a portion of my range is going to be, I have it.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.140
 I got the best hand.

12:00.140 --> 12:01.860
 And a portion of my range is going to be bluffs

12:01.860 --> 12:03.380
 and they'll be balanced.

12:03.380 --> 12:05.780
 So in theory, no matter what you do,

12:05.780 --> 12:08.120
 no matter what you do, if you call or you fold,

12:08.120 --> 12:11.620
 in theory, it's just, you're printing a zero, as we say,

12:11.620 --> 12:14.460
 you're not gaining or losing any EV,

12:14.460 --> 12:15.380
 if you were to do it that way.

12:15.380 --> 12:16.280
 What's EV?

12:16.280 --> 12:18.140
 EV is expected value, right?

12:18.140 --> 12:19.780
 So every play that you make,

12:19.780 --> 12:21.960
 you know, it either is going to in the long run,

12:21.960 --> 12:22.980
 you know, make you some money,

12:22.980 --> 12:24.380
 or it's just a losing play.

12:24.380 --> 12:25.340
 And as a professional,

12:25.340 --> 12:29.180
 you try to make the fewest amount of minus EV plays you can.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.860
 And the only reason you would make these minus EV plays

12:31.860 --> 12:34.140
 is potentially if you were trying to set up your opponent

12:34.140 --> 12:35.740
 for something later, right?

12:35.740 --> 12:38.660
 So I might make some minus EV plays, right?

12:38.660 --> 12:40.500
 So that I can exploit you later, right?

12:40.500 --> 12:42.720
 So you're building up an image,

12:42.720 --> 12:45.500
 a player profile that's false in some way.

12:45.500 --> 12:46.340
 Something that I'm going to,

12:46.340 --> 12:48.000
 I'm going to plant seeds in your mind

12:48.000 --> 12:49.560
 so that I can exploit them later.

12:49.560 --> 12:53.000
 So for example, why would players like show a big bluff?

12:53.000 --> 12:54.760
 Like what would be the reason for that?

12:54.760 --> 12:55.620
 They show a big bluff

12:55.620 --> 12:57.320
 so that you know that they're capable of it.

12:57.320 --> 12:58.260
 But maybe in their mind,

12:58.260 --> 12:59.820
 you're never going to do that again.

12:59.820 --> 13:02.460
 But now they think, you know, he bluffed me last time.

13:02.460 --> 13:03.580
 Maybe he's doing it again.

13:03.580 --> 13:06.760
 But that's a, what we call like a level, a leveling war.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.340
 Because it, you know, you can go back and forth

13:09.340 --> 13:11.560
 with whether or not, okay, this guy might know that.

13:11.560 --> 13:12.460
 Like he showed a bluff

13:12.460 --> 13:14.320
 because he's never going to bluff me again.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.860
 So that that's where it gets a little.

13:15.860 --> 13:17.940
 So that's a little bit different.

13:17.940 --> 13:19.620
 The, when we're talking about hand rangers,

13:19.620 --> 13:23.200
 that's different than building up a mental model

13:23.200 --> 13:24.620
 of what your opponents,

13:24.620 --> 13:26.840
 what your opponents think of you

13:26.840 --> 13:30.840
 and what your opponents think that you think of them

13:30.840 --> 13:32.360
 and so on and so forth.

13:32.360 --> 13:35.760
 Are you trying to construct those kinds of mental models?

13:35.760 --> 13:37.480
 And is that separate from the hand rangers?

13:37.480 --> 13:39.120
 They go hand in hand, right?

13:39.120 --> 13:41.360
 So if any given, in a given situation, right?

13:41.360 --> 13:45.160
 My range has this many value hands and this many bluffs.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.000
 Okay?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.260
 So in theory, if I want to be balanced, you know,

13:48.260 --> 13:49.920
 this is my range and this is what it looks like.

13:49.920 --> 13:52.680
 I'll bet this 50% of the time, bet this 50% of the time.

13:52.680 --> 13:57.480
 However, if I know that you think that I bluff too much,

13:57.480 --> 13:59.100
 right, then I'm not going to bluff as much.

13:59.100 --> 13:59.940
 I'm going to start,

13:59.940 --> 14:02.140
 instead of betting these hands that I would 50, 50,

14:02.140 --> 14:04.640
 now what I'll do is I'll do like 70, 30,

14:04.640 --> 14:06.160
 where I'm basically value betting

14:06.160 --> 14:08.640
 most of the time against you, you know, or vice versa.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.020
 If I know you always fold because you think I have it,

14:11.020 --> 14:12.360
 I'm going to veer the other way.

14:12.360 --> 14:13.520
 And instead of bluffing 50%,

14:13.520 --> 14:15.500
 I'll bluff 70, 80% of the time

14:15.500 --> 14:17.640
 to take advantage of your perception of me.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.040
 So to be successful,

14:19.040 --> 14:23.400
 do you have to construct a solid model of all the players

14:23.400 --> 14:26.600
 in the game or can you ignore them?

14:26.600 --> 14:27.920
 I think it's really important.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.880
 Like when I play, I have in my phone,

14:29.880 --> 14:32.200
 I have a player profile of everyone that I play with.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.040
 Whenever I pick up, whether it's physical tells

14:34.040 --> 14:38.760
 or tendencies they like to, you know, that they have.

14:38.760 --> 14:41.200
 And overall, that's just going to, you know,

14:41.200 --> 14:43.840
 that's going to allow you to exploit more, right?

14:43.840 --> 14:46.520
 So like if I played with somebody I've never played before,

14:46.520 --> 14:48.640
 I'm probably just going to play optimally

14:48.640 --> 14:51.640
 or at least as optimal as I know how until I start to,

14:51.640 --> 14:53.360
 you know, gain some information on that player

14:53.360 --> 14:55.500
 so that I can start to exploit them.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.420
 So what's the, when you say optimally,

14:57.420 --> 14:59.520
 what does optimally mean versus,

14:59.520 --> 15:04.400
 so game theory optimal versus exploitative?

15:04.400 --> 15:06.640
 Yeah, so that's like sort of the big debate in poker.

15:06.640 --> 15:07.800
 We call it for short,

15:07.800 --> 15:11.560
 GTO game theory optimal versus exploitative play.

15:11.560 --> 15:15.160
 So GTO game theory optimal is the idea that no,

15:15.160 --> 15:16.920
 like I'm going to set up my play

15:16.920 --> 15:20.400
 so that no matter what you do, you cannot exploit me.

15:20.400 --> 15:23.960
 So essentially that's playing rock, paper, scissors, right?

15:23.960 --> 15:27.640
 And throwing 33% of each every time, right?

15:27.640 --> 15:29.920
 Nothing you do can beat that, nothing.

15:29.920 --> 15:31.980
 You'll never be able to beat that, right?

15:31.980 --> 15:34.400
 Exploitative play is starting to notice that, okay,

15:34.400 --> 15:35.240
 well, you know what?

15:35.240 --> 15:36.200
 This guy loves rock.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.840
 He loves playing rock.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.460
 So I'm going to go paper a little more.

15:39.460 --> 15:40.600
 So I'm going to take advantage of them.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.200
 So I won't be through, but now all of a sudden,

15:42.200 --> 15:44.440
 when I do that, I'm no longer playing optimal

15:44.440 --> 15:46.240
 because if you knew that I was making that adjustment,

15:46.240 --> 15:47.960
 now you can exploit me.

15:47.960 --> 15:49.200
 So that's where the sort of what we call

15:49.200 --> 15:52.440
 the leveling war happens, where people veer from,

15:52.440 --> 15:56.420
 you know, the optimal line of, okay, 33% each for each one.

15:56.420 --> 16:00.860
 You can't beat that, but you also can't win with that either.

16:00.860 --> 16:03.260
 So you're always trying to be at the cutting,

16:03.260 --> 16:06.120
 at the leading edge of suboptimal play.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.200
 Yeah, you're going back and forth.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.000
 And listen, at the highest levels,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
 like online that these guys play,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
 like they're trying to play pretty close

16:13.000 --> 16:15.120
 to like game theory optimal

16:15.120 --> 16:16.520
 because it's very difficult to do first of all.

16:16.520 --> 16:20.040
 No human being will ever be able to compute

16:20.040 --> 16:21.640
 at the level that computers can.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.420
 It's just never going to happen.

16:23.420 --> 16:26.640
 So that's where like the human mind has to come into play

16:26.640 --> 16:28.480
 and say, all right, well, you know,

16:28.480 --> 16:30.220
 if I was playing against the robot, I would do X,

16:30.220 --> 16:31.880
 but I'm not, I'm playing against you.

16:31.880 --> 16:32.880
 So I have to adjust.

16:32.880 --> 16:36.160
 So does game theory optimal only look at the betting

16:36.160 --> 16:40.560
 and the hands in the current hand

16:40.560 --> 16:42.280
 or does it look at the history?

16:42.280 --> 16:44.600
 So if you were to play optimally, optimally,

16:44.600 --> 16:46.280
 would you need to look at the history

16:46.280 --> 16:47.240
 of the individual players

16:47.240 --> 16:49.400
 or just every hand is taken afresh?

16:49.400 --> 16:52.000
 See, that's why I love playing exploitatively

16:52.000 --> 16:54.840
 for the most part, because with GTO,

16:54.840 --> 16:56.280
 anything that's happened in the past

16:56.280 --> 16:58.160
 has no bearing on this situation.

16:58.160 --> 17:00.680
 It's simply based on what is the optimal play

17:00.680 --> 17:02.340
 in a vacuum in this spot.

17:02.340 --> 17:03.840
 Whereas exploitatively, okay,

17:03.840 --> 17:06.140
 this guy bluffs way too much in these spots.

17:06.140 --> 17:08.980
 So now I can make an adjustment and call more, you know,

17:08.980 --> 17:11.000
 based on past information.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.120
 GTO doesn't take into account history at all.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.280
 So like in a tournament,

17:15.280 --> 17:17.680
 how quickly can you construct a player profile

17:17.680 --> 17:19.360
 that you've never played before?

17:19.360 --> 17:22.360
 Depends on the level of the buy in really, right?

17:22.360 --> 17:25.600
 So the higher the buy in, generally speaking,

17:25.600 --> 17:27.480
 you can assume if they're professionals,

17:27.480 --> 17:29.600
 that they're gonna have pretty similar profiles

17:29.600 --> 17:31.040
 because you know, everyone's playing,

17:31.040 --> 17:32.560
 you know, if you're playing this game well,

17:32.560 --> 17:34.660
 it looks similar, right?

17:34.660 --> 17:35.840
 At the lower levels, you know,

17:35.840 --> 17:39.020
 playing say in $1,000 or $1,500 buy in or less,

17:39.020 --> 17:41.800
 you know, within a half an hour or an hour,

17:41.800 --> 17:43.000
 I have an idea of all right,

17:43.000 --> 17:46.840
 just by seeing how some players played a few hands that,

17:46.840 --> 17:48.000
 you know, so here's the thing with poker,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.080
 it's like, I can see one clue of what he did.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.760
 And it tells me so much about what he'll do

17:51.760 --> 17:53.920
 in a vast number of scenarios.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.120
 And you're saying at the high level,

17:55.120 --> 17:56.440
 people don't give too many clues.

17:56.440 --> 17:57.280
 I mean, then.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.160
 Well, at the highest level is,

17:59.160 --> 18:00.480
 people are so much more similar

18:00.480 --> 18:02.200
 in terms of their style of play.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.880
 They try to find some kind of balance between the GTO.

18:04.880 --> 18:07.240
 And now with all that we've seen on TV, right?

18:07.240 --> 18:08.880
 Like people get to watch streams and whatever.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.860
 So you get to watch all the top players play.

18:10.860 --> 18:11.960
 So if you wanna learn how to play better,

18:11.960 --> 18:12.840
 guess what you do?

18:12.840 --> 18:14.920
 You copy what they're doing, essentially.

18:14.920 --> 18:16.440
 Like, oh, he's only raising this much.

18:16.440 --> 18:17.560
 I'm gonna do the same.

18:17.560 --> 18:18.400
 They're betting this much.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.360
 I'm gonna do the same.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.520
 So as a result,

18:21.520 --> 18:23.980
 what you end up having is sort of,

18:25.120 --> 18:26.600
 you know, everyone deciding.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.480
 Like, I guess it's similar in chess with openings, right?

18:28.480 --> 18:29.840
 People figure out, okay, this is an opening.

18:29.840 --> 18:30.960
 This is what you do.

18:30.960 --> 18:31.840
 And that's it, you know?

18:31.840 --> 18:33.360
 And then everyone's similar to that.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.060
 And then you have, of course, the outliers

18:35.060 --> 18:36.760
 who try to do things a little differently

18:36.760 --> 18:38.360
 and confuse people.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.500
 It seems like the outliers,

18:39.500 --> 18:41.400
 like we talked offline that Magnus,

18:41.400 --> 18:43.480
 in order to win Magnus Carlsen,

18:43.480 --> 18:45.980
 has to play suboptimally in the openings

18:45.980 --> 18:49.320
 to take his opponents out of the comfort zone

18:49.320 --> 18:51.520
 so he can play what he calls pure chess

18:51.520 --> 18:52.880
 as quickly as possible,

18:52.880 --> 18:56.280
 which is just both short and deep calculations.

18:56.280 --> 18:57.760
 Purely, you're looking at the board

18:57.760 --> 19:01.720
 versus memorized openings and memorized lines.

19:01.720 --> 19:05.440
 Is it the case that the best poker players

19:05.440 --> 19:09.760
 are the ones that are able to, at the right time,

19:09.760 --> 19:14.760
 play really suboptimally or really unorthodox?

19:15.480 --> 19:17.080
 Yeah, specifically there's one guy

19:17.080 --> 19:19.580
 who last year sort of took the poker world by storm,

19:19.580 --> 19:21.080
 and his name was Michael Adamo.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.840
 And he was doing things, like I said,

19:22.840 --> 19:25.100
 you know, most of the top pros play very similarly

19:25.100 --> 19:27.280
 with the way that they construct ranges

19:27.280 --> 19:28.860
 and their bet sizing and all these kinds of things.

19:28.860 --> 19:30.840
 He was doing some crazy things

19:30.840 --> 19:32.720
 that nobody else was doing.

19:32.720 --> 19:36.080
 So he studied sort of a different form of poker

19:36.080 --> 19:38.080
 and it was unorthodox.

19:38.080 --> 19:40.380
 And it, you know, it throws people off

19:40.380 --> 19:41.720
 because he's in his comfort zone

19:41.720 --> 19:43.360
 with these bet sizes and different things,

19:43.360 --> 19:44.400
 whereas everyone else,

19:44.400 --> 19:46.640
 they're not well studied in those spots.

19:46.640 --> 19:49.200
 So as a result of him being unorthodox,

19:49.200 --> 19:51.640
 he became like a monster and very difficult to play against

19:51.640 --> 19:53.080
 because he really knew what he was doing with it.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.800
 In tournament or cash games?

19:54.800 --> 19:55.640
 It was tournaments, yeah.

19:55.640 --> 19:56.920
 He was crushing tournaments.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.640
 He was going against the norm

19:58.640 --> 20:00.960
 in terms of what is like, you know,

20:00.960 --> 20:02.720
 this is what you should do as a poker player in this spot.

20:02.720 --> 20:04.160
 He wasn't doing that.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.800
 He was doing what he thought was best

20:05.800 --> 20:07.120
 and he was doing things outside the norm

20:07.120 --> 20:08.960
 that again, in a vacuum, you could look at that

20:08.960 --> 20:10.920
 and you go, that's incorrect.

20:10.920 --> 20:11.920
 That he should not do.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.700
 That is a clear cut mistake.

20:13.700 --> 20:16.240
 Even, you know, the solvers or the computers

20:16.240 --> 20:18.520
 or game theory would say, this is wrong what he's doing.

20:18.520 --> 20:21.400
 But it's not wrong if he's doing it in a way

20:21.400 --> 20:24.200
 that he's exploiting other players tendencies.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.200
 So for example, with him,

20:26.200 --> 20:28.640
 say he's playing far too aggressively, okay?

20:28.640 --> 20:31.280
 That's not good unless your opponents

20:31.280 --> 20:33.000
 are playing way too passively.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.720
 So if your opponents are playing passively,

20:34.720 --> 20:36.420
 the answer is to be more aggressive with them.

20:36.420 --> 20:38.000
 And that's, I think one of the, you know,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.820
 biggest advantages he had was he was willing to do that.

20:40.820 --> 20:44.440
 So bet huge, big, big pots bluffing.

20:44.440 --> 20:45.280
 Huge.

20:45.280 --> 20:47.520
 So in a spot where somebody would make it a thousand,

20:47.520 --> 20:49.440
 he's making it 22,000.

20:49.440 --> 20:50.440
 Like what?

20:50.440 --> 20:51.280
 What is this?

20:51.280 --> 20:52.120
 This makes no sense.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.720
 And then people kind of know he has nothing,

20:53.720 --> 20:56.340
 but they're too afraid to call him on it.

20:56.340 --> 20:58.160
 Well, and then sometimes what happens is

20:58.160 --> 20:59.320
 this is where the leveling comes in.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.560
 You're like, man, this guy's crazy.

21:00.560 --> 21:01.600
 He's bluffing like nuts.

21:01.600 --> 21:04.000
 Then he bets the 22,000 and you say,

21:04.000 --> 21:05.240
 ah, I'm taking my stand.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.720
 I call, and then he shows you like, you know,

21:07.720 --> 21:09.480
 four of a kind or something like that.

21:09.480 --> 21:11.160
 So he gets people out of their comfort zone.

21:11.160 --> 21:12.560
 And I really enjoy watching him play.

21:12.560 --> 21:15.800
 He's probably my favorite player to watch today.

21:15.800 --> 21:16.880
 Watching a guy like that,

21:16.880 --> 21:19.280
 what aspect of his play have you been able

21:19.280 --> 21:20.800
 to incorporate into your own?

21:20.800 --> 21:22.120
 Like, what do you learn from that?

21:22.120 --> 21:23.000
 Cause you're constantly learning,

21:23.000 --> 21:23.960
 you're constantly adjusting.

21:23.960 --> 21:24.800
 Yeah.

21:24.800 --> 21:25.620
 Well, no, and I love it.

21:25.620 --> 21:27.160
 And as I said, so I think a lot of players

21:27.160 --> 21:28.840
 sort of come to the same conclusions about

21:28.840 --> 21:30.760
 this is how you play the spot, but he doesn't.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.760
 And I love watching and thinking in terms of like,

21:32.760 --> 21:33.800
 why he's doing this.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.480
 And one specific thing, for example,

21:35.480 --> 21:38.320
 is he's willing to really go for it.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.680
 So in a spot where let's say he bets 2000,

21:40.680 --> 21:43.760
 he knows he'll get you to call 2000, right?

21:43.760 --> 21:45.480
 But he wants it all.

21:45.480 --> 21:46.360
 He wants it all.

21:46.360 --> 21:47.800
 So he says, you know what?

21:47.800 --> 21:50.320
 I'll give up the 2000 that's guaranteed

21:50.320 --> 21:52.780
 and I'll bet 50,000.

21:52.780 --> 21:54.580
 And maybe if you call that now, you know,

21:54.580 --> 21:57.080
 so listen, you lose the 2007, eight times,

21:57.080 --> 21:59.680
 but if I get called for the 50 just once,

21:59.680 --> 22:01.280
 you know, I'm profiting from that.

22:01.280 --> 22:05.120
 And it also sets the, you know, the template for you

22:05.120 --> 22:07.040
 to really sort of be a player

22:07.040 --> 22:08.120
 that people are afraid to play against.

22:08.120 --> 22:11.080
 He knocked me out in a tournament very early on

22:11.080 --> 22:12.200
 in a huge event.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.400
 And he had, he was so far ahead.

22:14.400 --> 22:17.520
 He was one step ahead of my thought process in hand.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.920
 And he did something that makes no sense whatsoever.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.400
 I looked it up on the computer.

22:21.400 --> 22:24.320
 Huge mistake, if you will, but not a mistake

22:24.320 --> 22:25.880
 because he was taking advantage of my tendency.

22:25.880 --> 22:26.800
 Do you remember the cars?

22:26.800 --> 22:27.640
 Is there an example?

22:27.640 --> 22:28.460
 I remember the whole thing.

22:28.460 --> 22:29.300
 Yeah.

22:29.300 --> 22:30.760
 I remember it like it was yesterday.

22:30.760 --> 22:33.200
 Can you take it like through an example hand

22:33.200 --> 22:34.800
 that really demonstrates it?

22:34.800 --> 22:36.240
 So I'll explain the hand here.

22:36.240 --> 22:39.440
 So I'm on the button and I have ace king,

22:39.440 --> 22:40.800
 which is a very good hand.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.800
 And I raise and he calls from the big blind.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.440
 The flop is nine, seven, five.

22:45.440 --> 22:47.040
 So I have nothing really here.

22:47.040 --> 22:49.240
 He checks, I check behind.

22:49.240 --> 22:51.320
 The turn card's an ace.

22:51.320 --> 22:53.560
 He checks, I bet half the pot.

22:53.560 --> 22:56.820
 There were 6,000 there, I bet 3,000, okay?

22:56.820 --> 22:59.140
 Now this is not a typical thing you see people do,

22:59.140 --> 23:01.760
 but he raised me to 36,000.

23:01.760 --> 23:04.560
 Massive raise, bigger than the size of the pot.

23:04.560 --> 23:05.720
 What was the flop again?

23:05.720 --> 23:08.000
 Nine, seven, five, turn an ace.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.040
 What is he representing exactly?

23:10.040 --> 23:10.880
 Well, he could have a straight,

23:10.880 --> 23:12.200
 he could have three, three of a kind.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.600
 He could have, you know, aces up.

23:13.600 --> 23:14.760
 He could have a whole bunch of hands.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.960
 So he check raises me big to 36,000.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.160
 I call the bet.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.040
 So now there's something like 75,000.

23:20.040 --> 23:23.640
 The river is a five.

23:23.640 --> 23:25.660
 So the board pairs, okay?

23:26.840 --> 23:29.040
 He thinks for a while and he bets all of it,

23:29.040 --> 23:30.600
 which is three times the pot.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.300
 He bets 225,000.

23:32.300 --> 23:34.720
 There's only 75,000 out there, right?

23:34.720 --> 23:36.960
 And in theory, he should never ever have a hand

23:36.960 --> 23:38.640
 that can do that, right?

23:38.640 --> 23:39.960
 So it confused me.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.840
 And I was like, okay, well, this guy's aggressive.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.220
 He likes to bluff and all this kind of stuff.

23:43.220 --> 23:45.280
 So I made the call with the ace king

23:45.280 --> 23:47.200
 and he turned over six, eight.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.720
 So we had a straight, but here's the thing.

23:49.720 --> 23:52.920
 In theory, that river card is bad for him.

23:52.920 --> 23:55.980
 When I call the turn, I have a lot of the time,

23:55.980 --> 23:58.320
 three of a kind, two pair that just made a full house.

23:58.320 --> 23:59.640
 So he was risking that.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.300
 And the reason he did it was

24:01.300 --> 24:05.480
 because he thought I would perceive him to be bluffing a lot.

24:05.480 --> 24:07.520
 So he just went for it and it worked.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.240
 He was able to double up right away

24:09.240 --> 24:11.160
 and knock me out of the tournament like an hour in.

24:11.160 --> 24:12.600
 Do you think he thought you might fold?

24:12.600 --> 24:13.440
 Like what is it?

24:13.440 --> 24:15.120
 I think specific, I think it was, it came down to this.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.000
 It's as simple as this.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.580
 He was cognizant of his image

24:19.580 --> 24:21.680
 as being a wild, aggressive bluffer, right?

24:21.680 --> 24:24.240
 And he was fully taking advantage of me,

24:24.240 --> 24:27.540
 knowing that my tendency in these spots is to be curious.

24:27.540 --> 24:29.400
 And I want to call and I want to see it.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.760
 So he was fully taking advantage of the fact

24:31.760 --> 24:33.520
 that he thought I would call too often.

24:33.520 --> 24:35.800
 Because otherwise his play makes no sense.

24:35.800 --> 24:39.000
 A small bet, a medium sized bet, those make sense.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.800
 But the bet that he made in theory is indefensible.

24:42.800 --> 24:45.140
 It's just like clearly a mistake.

24:45.140 --> 24:47.040
 But that's why poker is so fascinating

24:47.040 --> 24:48.880
 because he makes this play and it wasn't a mistake.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.840
 It was above the rim, is what it was.

24:50.840 --> 24:53.300
 Do you think he put you on ace something?

24:53.300 --> 24:54.760
 I think exactly what he thought I had,

24:54.760 --> 24:57.160
 was ace king or something like that.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.000
 You know?

24:58.000 --> 24:58.840
 That is so fun.

24:58.840 --> 25:01.240
 That is so fun that the two players at such a high level

25:01.240 --> 25:03.720
 were able to mess with each other's mind.

25:03.720 --> 25:04.540
 How old is he?

25:04.540 --> 25:05.380
 Is he young?

25:05.380 --> 25:06.200
 He's in his 20s, yeah.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.760
 I feel like that takes a lot of guts

25:07.760 --> 25:10.040
 to take risks like that.

25:10.040 --> 25:11.280
 Well, that's what's great about him.

25:11.280 --> 25:12.480
 He's certainly never accused

25:12.480 --> 25:13.840
 of not having the guts to put it in.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.540
 And that's scary to play against, right?

25:15.540 --> 25:17.000
 The easiest opponent to play against

25:17.000 --> 25:18.940
 is one who's just straightforward,

25:18.940 --> 25:21.660
 passive, you know, not wild and crazy.

25:21.660 --> 25:23.120
 Playing against him,

25:23.120 --> 25:25.080
 he's going to put you in the blender, as we say.

25:25.080 --> 25:28.840
 Yeah, how can you control

25:28.840 --> 25:31.960
 what you're perceived as representing?

25:31.960 --> 25:34.360
 What hand you're perceived of as representing?

25:34.360 --> 25:38.400
 So if we're, if the game of modern poker is,

25:38.400 --> 25:40.560
 others are representing certain hands

25:40.560 --> 25:42.280
 through the information they convey,

25:42.280 --> 25:45.000
 and you're representing a certain hand range, sorry,

25:45.840 --> 25:47.540
 through your play, how can you control that?

25:47.540 --> 25:50.740
 Or is that not, is that the wrong way to think about it?

25:50.740 --> 25:54.200
 But isn't bluffing and bet sizing

25:54.200 --> 25:57.400
 and all of that kind of stuff essentially controlling

25:57.400 --> 26:01.200
 what others perceive as the hand range you have?

26:01.200 --> 26:04.000
 Ultimately, in terms of like controlling

26:04.000 --> 26:06.520
 people's perception of you, you can't fully control it,

26:06.520 --> 26:10.720
 but you can do things to sway it, right?

26:10.720 --> 26:12.880
 As I said earlier, showing bluffs and things like that,

26:12.880 --> 26:14.160
 you know, leads your opponent to think

26:14.160 --> 26:16.240
 maybe you do this more often than you're supposed to

26:16.240 --> 26:17.080
 or whatever the case may be.

26:17.080 --> 26:21.220
 But in terms of like controlling, you know,

26:21.220 --> 26:24.620
 what your opponent can think about your hands

26:24.620 --> 26:26.420
 in certain spots, I don't really think it equates that way.

26:26.420 --> 26:28.260
 It doesn't really, you know, I think what people do

26:28.260 --> 26:29.980
 when they're playing a hand is they think in terms of,

26:29.980 --> 26:33.100
 all right, what does my range look like here?

26:33.100 --> 26:35.460
 Okay, so my range has value.

26:35.460 --> 26:36.660
 So you look at, you know,

26:36.660 --> 26:38.880
 the actual hand you have secondarily.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.340
 So you say, okay, well, I could have this,

26:41.340 --> 26:43.780
 I could have this, I actually have this, right?

26:43.780 --> 26:44.860
 But I could have all these hands.

26:44.860 --> 26:46.780
 So my opponent, if he's thinking on a high level,

26:46.780 --> 26:49.080
 he knows I could have all these hands and I have this one.

26:49.080 --> 26:51.380
 So what do I do with this one, right, in the bigger scope

26:51.380 --> 26:52.220
 of things?

26:52.220 --> 26:55.860
 I guess I'm trying to understand if your betting

26:55.860 --> 26:58.980
 isn't a bet, preflop, your bet,

26:58.980 --> 27:01.500
 doesn't that narrow the hand ranges?

27:01.500 --> 27:04.660
 Doesn't matter what you have, it narrows the end.

27:04.660 --> 27:05.540
 Absolutely.

27:05.540 --> 27:10.540
 And if you bet big combined with the perception of you

27:11.820 --> 27:14.720
 at the table, doesn't that represent the hand range?

27:14.720 --> 27:16.020
 Uh huh, absolutely.

27:16.020 --> 27:18.240
 So like you can, with betting essentially control

27:18.240 --> 27:20.220
 what people estimate you to have.

27:20.220 --> 27:23.380
 Sure, so that makes it, so yeah, so that's true.

27:23.380 --> 27:26.440
 So for example, one of the most extreme examples is,

27:26.440 --> 27:29.660
 we have, there's spots where there's a bet

27:29.660 --> 27:31.920
 that's considered polarizing, right?

27:31.920 --> 27:34.540
 So let's say there's a thousand in the pot

27:34.540 --> 27:37.380
 and you bet 10,000, which is crazy big, right?

27:37.380 --> 27:38.580
 That's saying one of two things.

27:38.580 --> 27:41.380
 I either have the absolute best possible hand

27:41.380 --> 27:42.700
 or absolutely nothing,

27:42.700 --> 27:44.140
 because any of the hands in the middle,

27:44.140 --> 27:45.540
 I wouldn't do that with.

27:45.540 --> 27:47.980
 So I'm essentially telling you when I bet that,

27:47.980 --> 27:51.220
 I'm like, I either got it or I got,

27:51.220 --> 27:52.540
 I don't have a mediocre hand,

27:52.540 --> 27:54.520
 like just a pair of nines or a pair of tens.

27:54.520 --> 27:57.820
 I have a royal flush or have nine high.

27:57.820 --> 27:59.620
 So with my bet sizing,

27:59.620 --> 28:02.540
 I can control how my opponent is perceiving

28:02.540 --> 28:03.380
 what my range is gonna be.

28:03.380 --> 28:07.220
 So for example, similarly, if I bet small, right?

28:07.220 --> 28:09.540
 Well, that could be a lot of hands, right?

28:09.540 --> 28:12.180
 That could represent a big part of my range.

28:12.180 --> 28:14.740
 The bigger the bet, the more, the narrower the range.

28:14.740 --> 28:16.220
 Apparently the more polarized it is.

28:16.220 --> 28:19.380
 Yeah, how far could you get

28:19.380 --> 28:20.580
 without looking at your cards?

28:20.580 --> 28:22.700
 Do you think how well could you do?

28:22.700 --> 28:24.740
 It depends on who I'm playing with, right?

28:24.740 --> 28:26.380
 So if I was playing in a tournament

28:26.380 --> 28:28.320
 with mediocre or weak players,

28:28.320 --> 28:30.620
 I think I could probably do pretty well.

28:30.620 --> 28:32.420
 But even like world class.

28:32.420 --> 28:34.380
 World class, I don't think you'd have much of a chance,

28:34.380 --> 28:35.220
 really, I mean.

28:35.220 --> 28:36.580
 The question is trying to get at like,

28:36.580 --> 28:39.060
 how important is it that the actual hands you have

28:39.060 --> 28:41.900
 versus the hands you're representing?

28:41.900 --> 28:43.460
 Right, so that's the question of essentially,

28:43.460 --> 28:45.100
 if you're not looking at your hand preflop,

28:45.100 --> 28:48.260
 you're basically giving up a fundamental advantage, right?

28:48.260 --> 28:50.660
 Where you're gonna be playing way suboptimally

28:50.660 --> 28:52.080
 in terms of your hand selection, right?

28:52.080 --> 28:53.420
 Cause if you don't look at your hand,

28:53.420 --> 28:54.880
 you might have a two and a three.

28:54.880 --> 28:56.940
 That's not good, but now you're playing it.

28:56.940 --> 28:59.620
 So you've invested whatever, two, 3000 bucks

28:59.620 --> 29:01.060
 with absolute garbage,

29:01.060 --> 29:03.700
 and it's very difficult to climb that hill, right?

29:03.700 --> 29:05.540
 So it's much better to actually look at your cards

29:05.540 --> 29:07.340
 and go, okay, I'll throw away the two and three

29:07.340 --> 29:08.860
 and I'll play the ace king.

29:08.860 --> 29:12.140
 Speaking of garbage, you've said that 10, seven

29:12.140 --> 29:13.580
 is your favorite poker hand to play.

29:13.580 --> 29:16.840
 Is that still the case and what aspect of it

29:16.840 --> 29:18.820
 is that you enjoy?

29:18.820 --> 29:21.580
 Yeah, so it's one of those viewer discretion is advised.

29:21.580 --> 29:24.340
 Like 10, seven, I've just noticed throughout my life,

29:24.340 --> 29:27.280
 you know, it's a tendency thing that I've been lucky with it.

29:27.280 --> 29:28.180
 So that's just sort of,

29:28.180 --> 29:30.220
 but it's not like I'm gonna look at 10, seven and go,

29:30.220 --> 29:32.300
 oh, wow, you know, I'm gonna call it all in

29:32.300 --> 29:33.260
 or anything like that.

29:33.260 --> 29:35.740
 I'll play it in situations where it makes sense,

29:35.740 --> 29:38.260
 but you know, it's rare cause it's not a very good hand.

29:38.260 --> 29:42.960
 But is there some aspect of belief

29:42.960 --> 29:47.020
 in the magic of this hand manifests quality of play?

29:47.020 --> 29:47.860
 Or is that a little?

29:47.860 --> 29:48.700
 There should be.

29:48.700 --> 29:49.940
 So here's the thing, it's, you know,

29:49.940 --> 29:51.460
 poker players, some have said

29:51.460 --> 29:53.340
 it's unlucky to be superstitious,

29:53.340 --> 29:55.940
 but we're all a little bit superstitious, a little bit.

29:55.940 --> 29:57.300
 You know, and so I don't know,

29:57.300 --> 29:59.240
 maybe it is a case where when I have 10, seven,

29:59.240 --> 30:01.900
 I feel somehow energetically that, you know,

30:01.900 --> 30:03.260
 I'm more likely to catch something,

30:03.260 --> 30:06.020
 which may actually make me more apt to be aggressive

30:06.020 --> 30:07.340
 and confident in the hand.

30:07.340 --> 30:10.060
 But you really shouldn't let yourself do that.

30:10.060 --> 30:11.180
 Like you're not supposed to fall in love

30:11.180 --> 30:12.780
 with any specific hands.

30:12.780 --> 30:17.780
 Yeah, but you know, uncertainty is ruthless.

30:18.220 --> 30:23.220
 It's, you know, the fact that it's a game of statistics,

30:23.380 --> 30:26.900
 it can be too painful for the human psychology.

30:26.900 --> 30:30.820
 So maybe you have to hold on to certain superstitions.

30:30.820 --> 30:34.420
 Because, you know, I mean, there's a cold absurdity

30:34.420 --> 30:38.740
 to the fact that you can play extremely well and still lose.

30:38.740 --> 30:43.740
 I mean, actually this year you've played the,

30:43.980 --> 30:47.700
 what is it, 50 days of World Series of Poker.

30:47.700 --> 30:50.980
 And it seems like, at least from the perspective

30:50.980 --> 30:53.020
 of me looking at it through the internet,

30:53.020 --> 30:54.620
 it seems like there's a lot of hands

30:54.620 --> 30:59.140
 that you were like 70, 30, 80, 20, all in hands

30:59.140 --> 31:02.420
 that you just did not, were not going your way.

31:02.420 --> 31:04.220
 That can sort of break you mentally.

31:04.220 --> 31:05.460
 Absolutely.

31:05.460 --> 31:07.460
 Yeah, one of the hardest things, especially about playing,

31:07.460 --> 31:09.620
 because cash games and tournaments are different.

31:09.620 --> 31:11.140
 One of the most difficult things about, you know,

31:11.140 --> 31:13.380
 being a tournament player is resilience.

31:13.380 --> 31:14.820
 Because more often than not, like,

31:14.820 --> 31:17.420
 so if there's a tournament with a thousand people,

31:17.420 --> 31:19.460
 to win the tournament, you have to get all of the chips.

31:19.460 --> 31:22.220
 That means there's one winner and 999 losers.

31:22.220 --> 31:25.500
 So it's very rare that you actually like win all the chips.

31:25.500 --> 31:27.220
 So you're essentially at some point

31:27.220 --> 31:28.180
 in every tournament you play,

31:28.180 --> 31:31.320
 gonna deal with like really bad luck and disappointment.

31:31.320 --> 31:34.540
 And sometimes those streaks can have you question yourself

31:34.540 --> 31:35.980
 and be introspective about, okay,

31:35.980 --> 31:38.020
 so I think I'm 47 now.

31:38.020 --> 31:40.220
 I think I've gotten better as time went on

31:40.220 --> 31:42.140
 between distinguishing, okay,

31:42.140 --> 31:44.720
 am I losing right now because of bad luck?

31:44.720 --> 31:47.020
 Or is it fundamentally decisions I'm making

31:47.020 --> 31:48.820
 are not very good, right?

31:48.820 --> 31:50.220
 And that's one of the hardest things

31:50.220 --> 31:53.300
 for anyone who plays poker to get to, right?

31:53.300 --> 31:54.340
 Why am I losing?

31:54.340 --> 31:57.300
 Am I losing because of my opponents being better?

31:57.300 --> 31:59.460
 I'm not playing well, or am I losing just because of luck?

31:59.460 --> 32:02.580
 And because there's so much variance in poker,

32:02.580 --> 32:04.780
 a lot of players can be confused

32:04.780 --> 32:06.020
 on both sides of the coin.

32:06.020 --> 32:07.700
 One guy's winning and he thinks he's great.

32:07.700 --> 32:11.020
 He's really not, wait till the cards break even as we say.

32:11.020 --> 32:13.500
 I think there's a lot of parallels to life as well.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.620
 If you get screwed over, over and over,

32:15.620 --> 32:17.980
 it's hard to know if you're doing something wrong

32:17.980 --> 32:19.940
 or if it's just bad luck.

32:19.940 --> 32:20.980
 I think they did a study.

32:20.980 --> 32:22.060
 I remember there was like a study

32:22.060 --> 32:23.900
 that was mostly related to gambling,

32:23.900 --> 32:25.980
 but it was mice and they put them in a little maze

32:25.980 --> 32:27.940
 and they go down these three tubes

32:27.940 --> 32:30.900
 and they go down this one tube and there'd be cheese, right?

32:30.900 --> 32:32.780
 And then they go down again, cheese.

32:32.780 --> 32:34.980
 Three times in a row there was cheese there, right?

32:34.980 --> 32:38.140
 The next time there was an electric shock there, not cheese.

32:39.500 --> 32:42.980
 The rat went, you know, the mouse went to get zapped.

32:42.980 --> 32:44.660
 He got zapped, okay, came back.

32:44.660 --> 32:47.420
 He kept going back to get zapped until he died.

32:47.420 --> 32:50.500
 Like he kept going because he found cheese there.

32:50.500 --> 32:52.100
 He has one there.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.740
 So he continued to go chase that win

32:54.740 --> 32:57.140
 despite it being, you know, now all of a sudden

32:57.140 --> 32:59.340
 not worthwhile till he died.

32:59.340 --> 33:01.260
 And essentially what they said was

33:01.260 --> 33:03.340
 that is essentially how they compared it

33:03.340 --> 33:04.980
 to like, you know, the gambling brain

33:04.980 --> 33:06.780
 and how people think about gambling.

33:06.780 --> 33:08.180
 You're chasing the wins.

33:08.180 --> 33:09.860
 You learn too much.

33:09.860 --> 33:12.420
 You sort of overgeneralize the lessons learned

33:12.420 --> 33:13.460
 from the times you've won.

33:13.460 --> 33:15.620
 So yeah, like beginner's luck can be detrimental.

33:15.620 --> 33:17.980
 If you have some early luck and you believe

33:17.980 --> 33:20.780
 that this is just the way it's supposed to be forever,

33:20.780 --> 33:23.500
 you know, it can put you in a delusional state

33:23.500 --> 33:26.500
 where, you know, you feel like I'm just great,

33:26.500 --> 33:27.420
 but no, you're not.

33:27.420 --> 33:28.740
 You were just lucky in the beginning.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.460
 I actually played poker once in Vegas.

33:31.460 --> 33:34.060
 It was a, it wasn't a tournament,

33:34.060 --> 33:37.900
 but it was a kind of tournament like style.

33:37.900 --> 33:39.060
 I already forgot what it was.

33:39.060 --> 33:42.980
 But what I do remember is that I had four of a kind.

33:42.980 --> 33:46.500
 So the last hand I've ever played in poker was,

33:46.500 --> 33:50.580
 I got a four of a kind and there was a couple of others

33:50.580 --> 33:51.460
 with really strong hands.

33:51.460 --> 33:53.100
 So everybody went all in.

33:53.100 --> 33:54.580
 And I think you get some kind of bonus

33:54.580 --> 33:55.500
 for getting four of a kind.

33:55.500 --> 33:56.860
 Bad beat jackpot you were playing in.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.460
 Yeah, so something like this.

33:58.460 --> 34:00.380
 I apologize if I don't know the details,

34:00.380 --> 34:02.300
 but I just remember winning a lot of money

34:02.300 --> 34:04.060
 and I walked away from the table.

34:04.060 --> 34:05.260
 I said, I'm not playing poker again.

34:05.260 --> 34:06.100
 This is great.

34:06.100 --> 34:07.060
 I'm gonna hit it up top.

34:07.060 --> 34:09.340
 Cause I started to feel like this is your,

34:09.340 --> 34:10.180
 I started to think,

34:10.180 --> 34:12.180
 even though I haven't really played poker at all,

34:12.180 --> 34:13.300
 that I'm good.

34:13.300 --> 34:15.420
 And that was a really dangerous feeling.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.180
 And everybody was really mad for walking away

34:17.180 --> 34:18.140
 from the table.

34:18.140 --> 34:19.460
 One of the other things that I think is interesting

34:19.460 --> 34:21.980
 about poker too is good is relative, right?

34:21.980 --> 34:25.180
 So you could be the seventh best player in the whole world,

34:25.180 --> 34:26.900
 like literally seventh best player.

34:26.900 --> 34:29.460
 But if you're playing with the other six,

34:29.460 --> 34:30.940
 you're the sucker.

34:30.940 --> 34:33.820
 You are like the worst player in the game, right?

34:33.820 --> 34:36.580
 So like there's a lot of players, for example,

34:36.580 --> 34:38.420
 like the Dan Blazarians of the world, right?

34:38.420 --> 34:40.580
 He's not a top level player,

34:40.580 --> 34:42.500
 like these guys you see on TV,

34:42.500 --> 34:44.620
 but he probably makes more money than they do

34:44.620 --> 34:46.020
 because he plays with people

34:46.020 --> 34:47.660
 that are far below his skill level.

34:47.660 --> 34:50.220
 So part of the skill of being a poker player

34:50.220 --> 34:53.580
 is finding situations where you're profitable,

34:53.580 --> 34:55.620
 regardless of your skill level.

34:55.620 --> 34:57.900
 Another connection to life.

34:57.900 --> 35:01.140
 Do you think Dan Blazarian is telling the truth

35:01.140 --> 35:04.740
 about having made, what is it, $50, $100 million?

35:04.740 --> 35:06.860
 Just a huge amount of money playing poker.

35:06.860 --> 35:09.380
 Considering what I know about the private games

35:09.380 --> 35:11.420
 and the types of players who play in these private games

35:11.420 --> 35:12.780
 and the stakes that they play,

35:12.780 --> 35:14.900
 I absolutely believe Dan has made,

35:14.900 --> 35:16.180
 I don't know how many millions,

35:16.180 --> 35:17.780
 but whether it's 50 or whatever,

35:17.780 --> 35:19.500
 but it wouldn't surprise me

35:19.500 --> 35:21.660
 that if you play in these games within a year

35:21.660 --> 35:23.900
 or you find the right businessman

35:23.900 --> 35:26.140
 who has way too much Bitcoin money,

35:26.140 --> 35:28.300
 and in one night you take him for 20 million,

35:28.300 --> 35:29.660
 I absolutely could see it.

35:29.660 --> 35:30.980
 I don't see any reason why.

35:30.980 --> 35:33.020
 Listen, where he got his money initially,

35:33.020 --> 35:36.540
 that's up to interpretation from his father or whatever,

35:36.540 --> 35:38.940
 but has he made a bunch of money playing poker?

35:38.940 --> 35:40.620
 Absolutely, no question.

35:40.620 --> 35:43.180
 Do you feel, as somebody who loves the game,

35:43.180 --> 35:46.300
 do you think there's something almost ethically wrong

35:46.300 --> 35:48.780
 in playing people much worse than you?

35:48.780 --> 35:50.180
 So yeah, that's a good question

35:50.180 --> 35:53.500
 because part of the reason I played poker

35:53.500 --> 35:54.580
 and wanted to become professional

35:54.580 --> 35:57.180
 was I wanted to make my mother proud, right?

35:57.180 --> 35:58.540
 And I don't think she would be proud of me

35:58.540 --> 36:03.020
 taking Grandma Betty's last $5 and down the street,

36:03.020 --> 36:05.260
 sending her broke and taking her pension check.

36:05.260 --> 36:06.500
 So I play at the high stakes

36:06.500 --> 36:07.780
 against people who can afford it.

36:07.780 --> 36:08.660
 They know who I am.

36:08.660 --> 36:09.500
 I'm not a hustler.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.540
 I'm not pretending I'm bad at poker to squeeze in.

36:12.540 --> 36:13.940
 I was thinking about this just yesterday

36:13.940 --> 36:15.060
 because I played in a game

36:15.060 --> 36:17.900
 that if I played that sort of role

36:17.900 --> 36:19.260
 where a lot of guys do pros

36:19.260 --> 36:21.620
 that sort of play down their skill level,

36:21.620 --> 36:23.420
 pretend they're just one of the guys,

36:23.420 --> 36:27.540
 these guys can make $20, $30 million in a year, legitimately.

36:27.540 --> 36:29.500
 Like I believe that like, if I did that,

36:29.500 --> 36:31.580
 if I just said, you know what, I'm gonna go down that path,

36:31.580 --> 36:33.100
 get into these games in LA, you know,

36:33.100 --> 36:34.500
 and travel and do all this kind of stuff,

36:34.500 --> 36:35.660
 I can make 20 million a year.

36:35.660 --> 36:38.100
 But it feels a little greasy, right?

36:38.100 --> 36:39.620
 I don't like to kiss anyone's ass.

36:39.620 --> 36:43.300
 I don't like to ask anyone for a favor or things like that.

36:43.300 --> 36:48.300
 So, but yeah, like I feel, listen,

36:48.700 --> 36:51.180
 a rich guy who wants to sit down with a million bucks

36:51.180 --> 36:53.180
 and get drunk and lose it, I have no empathy for that.

36:53.180 --> 36:55.620
 I'm like, I don't have any moral qualms with that.

36:55.620 --> 36:57.980
 So if a grandma Betty is a billionaire.

36:59.260 --> 37:01.180
 Send it, send it, right?

37:01.180 --> 37:03.220
 You know, absolutely, why not?

37:04.940 --> 37:06.900
 Well, let me ask you about a tough period

37:06.900 --> 37:08.020
 of your recent life.

37:08.020 --> 37:10.060
 You had a rough, like we mentioned,

37:10.060 --> 37:15.060
 the World Series of Poker losing $1.1 million over 48 days.

37:15.380 --> 37:18.440
 What were you going through mentally during that?

37:18.440 --> 37:20.280
 So here's the thing, you know, I do, like you said,

37:20.280 --> 37:21.520
 I do a YouTube vlog every day.

37:21.520 --> 37:23.820
 So I kind of share my thoughts and listen,

37:23.820 --> 37:26.740
 I can edit that thing and keep out the bad stuff,

37:26.740 --> 37:29.820
 but I think it's more authentic and genuine to show people

37:29.820 --> 37:32.060
 the actual struggles and the pain that I go through,

37:32.060 --> 37:32.900
 you know, without it.

37:32.900 --> 37:35.020
 And I'd say the one thing I'm most proud of

37:35.020 --> 37:36.620
 throughout the entire thing is the resilience

37:36.620 --> 37:39.020
 because there are moments you see me where I'm broken.

37:39.020 --> 37:39.980
 I'm just like, I can't take it.

37:39.980 --> 37:41.720
 I broke a selfie stick this year.

37:41.720 --> 37:42.940
 Like I was filming it.

37:42.940 --> 37:43.940
 Cause you know, I do for my vlog,

37:43.940 --> 37:46.220
 I smashed the stick through it in the corner, right?

37:46.220 --> 37:49.220
 It's just, that was my like hit rock bottom moment.

37:49.220 --> 37:51.220
 And then I put the camera on me and I was like, all right,

37:51.220 --> 37:52.340
 I'll let people see it.

37:52.340 --> 37:53.860
 But mentally it was very difficult

37:53.860 --> 37:56.860
 because there was a feeling of hopelessness

37:56.860 --> 38:00.020
 where I was making good decisions.

38:00.020 --> 38:02.680
 Like I genuinely felt like I'm playing really, really well.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.940
 But every time my money went in and my opponent's money

38:04.940 --> 38:08.140
 went in and say, I was 60%, 70%, 80%

38:08.140 --> 38:11.460
 for about a two week stretch, I lost every one of those.

38:11.460 --> 38:13.500
 And you start to wonder, you're like,

38:13.500 --> 38:16.900
 I can't win if I never win, you know, in these spots.

38:16.900 --> 38:18.300
 So it was difficult.

38:18.300 --> 38:20.980
 Luckily I have, you know, 20 odd years of experience

38:20.980 --> 38:21.980
 on how to deal with it.

38:21.980 --> 38:26.020
 And so, as I said, I wake up the next day, ready to go.

38:26.020 --> 38:27.940
 So as if nothing happened.

38:27.940 --> 38:28.780
 To a certain degree.

38:28.780 --> 38:30.500
 Obviously, you know, the more,

38:30.500 --> 38:32.180
 the more it happens in the higher vines,

38:32.180 --> 38:34.020
 like the one where I broke the selfie stick,

38:34.020 --> 38:37.060
 I lost 500,000 in that tournament, right?

38:37.060 --> 38:38.980
 And it was like the last card, it was painful.

38:38.980 --> 38:40.260
 I think you lost.

38:40.260 --> 38:42.020
 Yeah, that was great, that video.

38:43.340 --> 38:45.020
 I think he lost.

38:45.020 --> 38:47.540
 What led up to the selfie stick gate?

38:47.540 --> 38:49.620
 Like what, you just lost your shit

38:49.620 --> 38:53.780
 for a, like a hundred milliseconds.

38:53.780 --> 38:55.340
 Like it was very brief.

38:55.340 --> 38:58.300
 You're just like, what, the world wasn't making any sense.

38:58.300 --> 39:00.780
 Like, how do I keep losing kind of thing?

39:00.780 --> 39:02.460
 How did you, why did you lose your shit?

39:02.460 --> 39:03.700
 You should never really think like this,

39:03.700 --> 39:06.940
 but part of me felt like I deserved to win this, right?

39:06.940 --> 39:07.780
 So part of me was like, listen,

39:07.780 --> 39:10.100
 I've lost so many in the last two weeks, all right.

39:10.100 --> 39:12.660
 Let, you know, the poker gods be kind to me right now.

39:12.660 --> 39:13.500
 Let me win this.

39:13.500 --> 39:14.380
 And it looked good.

39:14.380 --> 39:17.140
 I was in a great situation on the flop,

39:17.140 --> 39:18.260
 great situation on the turn.

39:18.260 --> 39:20.020
 I'm about to be a competitor.

39:20.020 --> 39:21.900
 I'm going to be a contender in this tournament

39:21.900 --> 39:24.620
 to win a big prize pool and turn the whole thing around.

39:24.620 --> 39:26.460
 It's all there for the taking.

39:26.460 --> 39:29.380
 And then boom, the last card, it just, you know,

39:29.380 --> 39:31.500
 it was a couple of weeks of frustration

39:31.500 --> 39:33.820
 in the moment of filming that I just had, you know,

39:33.820 --> 39:35.540
 sort of a visceral reaction, you know,

39:35.540 --> 39:37.780
 and I smacked the, smacked the selfie stick.

39:37.780 --> 39:40.340
 And then like, I, it was, I see a corner, it's safe.

39:40.340 --> 39:41.900
 I threw the selfie stick on the ground.

39:41.900 --> 39:45.180
 And of course, social media blows up about how, you know,

39:45.180 --> 39:47.620
 it was a violent act, you know?

39:47.620 --> 39:49.420
 I mean, it's like, have you never watched sports?

39:49.420 --> 39:51.420
 Have you never seen a guy on the golf course

39:51.420 --> 39:53.420
 smack his club or throw their helmet?

39:53.420 --> 39:55.180
 Like, you know, there was the,

39:55.180 --> 39:57.380
 there's a guy, Justin Bonomo is a poker player.

39:57.380 --> 40:00.580
 And he's a super, how to, for lack of a better word,

40:00.580 --> 40:02.020
 offended by everything.

40:02.020 --> 40:04.740
 And he was equating my throwing a stick on the ground

40:04.740 --> 40:07.500
 to violence against women, domestic abuse,

40:07.500 --> 40:09.180
 and the idea that like,

40:09.180 --> 40:12.060
 this makes women feel unsafe to play poker.

40:12.060 --> 40:13.460
 And so that was kind of a running joke

40:13.460 --> 40:15.820
 for the last two weeks where every time I sat at a table,

40:15.820 --> 40:19.340
 the guys would be like, oh, I feel unsafe, I feel unsafe.

40:19.340 --> 40:20.180
 Yeah.

40:20.180 --> 40:21.020
 Can you take me through the hand?

40:21.020 --> 40:21.840
 Do you remember what the hand was?

40:21.840 --> 40:22.680
 Like, what was the...

40:22.680 --> 40:25.700
 Yeah, so it was a, you know, a player on the button raised.

40:25.700 --> 40:27.460
 David Peters, very aggressive player.

40:27.460 --> 40:29.060
 He went all in from the blind

40:29.060 --> 40:31.060
 and I had a pair of pocket tens.

40:31.060 --> 40:34.100
 So I went with my tens and he had queen 10 of spades.

40:34.100 --> 40:35.380
 So I was good.

40:35.380 --> 40:37.020
 I have way the best hand.

40:37.020 --> 40:40.100
 And the flop was like king nine, three, one spade.

40:40.100 --> 40:42.460
 Turn was like the eight of spades.

40:42.460 --> 40:45.220
 So now he has a flush draw and the river was another spade.

40:45.220 --> 40:47.740
 So he caught spade, spade, and he made a flush.

40:47.740 --> 40:50.660
 Wow, but statistically you were winning the whole time.

40:50.660 --> 40:52.300
 Yeah, I was winning it up until the last card.

40:52.300 --> 40:53.860
 What did he go all in on?

40:53.860 --> 40:54.900
 Was it a bluff?

40:54.900 --> 40:57.140
 He made what's considered like a pretty standard play

40:57.140 --> 40:59.500
 in modern poker where, you know, a guy raised

40:59.500 --> 41:01.500
 and he was just trying to pick up, you know, what was there.

41:01.500 --> 41:03.140
 And he ran into a hand in the big blind

41:03.140 --> 41:04.420
 and you know, he got lucky.

41:04.420 --> 41:08.420
 So what was the throughout the strategy of preparation,

41:08.420 --> 41:09.820
 the strategy of play?

41:09.820 --> 41:12.580
 So you're playing so many days.

41:12.580 --> 41:14.380
 Are you trying to ignore the results

41:14.380 --> 41:16.900
 and stick to a particular strategy?

41:16.900 --> 41:19.500
 Yes, for the most part, you know,

41:19.500 --> 41:21.580
 what I'm trying to do is like,

41:21.580 --> 41:23.260
 I formulate a strategy for the whole seven weeks

41:23.260 --> 41:25.940
 cause there's a varying degree of buy ins too.

41:25.940 --> 41:28.340
 Like you have small ones, like 1500,

41:28.340 --> 41:30.220
 then you've got like $250,000 buy in.

41:30.220 --> 41:33.460
 So I map out the seven weeks and right,

41:33.460 --> 41:36.340
 I'll give a little bit of mental energy to the 1500,

41:36.340 --> 41:37.580
 which means I'll be on my phone.

41:37.580 --> 41:39.700
 I'm not gonna, I don't care as much about this one,

41:39.700 --> 41:43.820
 but the 250K fully engaged, fully focused, you know,

41:43.820 --> 41:45.740
 up against obviously the higher the buy in,

41:45.740 --> 41:48.260
 you know, super top competition.

41:48.260 --> 41:50.940
 And you know, as far as strategy goes,

41:50.940 --> 41:53.940
 focusing on each day, playing the best I can,

41:53.940 --> 41:55.580
 not the result.

41:55.580 --> 41:57.260
 Like, cause if you focus on the result,

41:57.260 --> 41:58.700
 you're focusing in the wrong place.

41:58.700 --> 42:02.020
 Your focus should be on the decisions you actually make.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.620
 Right, and if you're making good decisions consistently,

42:04.620 --> 42:05.700
 you have to continue to do that.

42:05.700 --> 42:06.980
 The frustrating part is this,

42:06.980 --> 42:09.060
 with poker, unlike chess or other things,

42:09.060 --> 42:12.420
 making the best possible decision doesn't mean you win.

42:12.420 --> 42:14.580
 Often you lose, you don't, chess.

42:15.540 --> 42:19.020
 Well, Magnus Carlsen has also talked about that.

42:20.860 --> 42:25.300
 There's some non deterministic thing about chess too,

42:25.300 --> 42:30.260
 given the limited cognitive capacity of the human mind.

42:30.260 --> 42:33.100
 So he says that the world championship should have

42:33.100 --> 42:36.660
 20, 30, 40, 50 games, not the few that they have.

42:36.660 --> 42:38.300
 It's too low of a sample.

42:38.300 --> 42:41.980
 So in that sense, the high stakes poker tournaments

42:41.980 --> 42:44.300
 are very too low sample.

42:44.300 --> 42:45.340
 Sure, yeah.

42:45.340 --> 42:47.220
 Well, when you think of the world series of poker,

42:47.220 --> 42:49.820
 so as you said, I lost about 1 million, right?

42:49.820 --> 42:52.300
 In one tournament, that was 500,000.

42:52.300 --> 42:53.820
 So then, you know, like a few others here

42:53.820 --> 42:54.660
 of high buying tournaments.

42:54.660 --> 42:57.700
 So the sample or the amount was, you know,

42:57.700 --> 43:00.540
 40, 50 total tournaments with, you know, high variance.

43:00.540 --> 43:03.340
 And if you don't run well or do well in the highest buy ins,

43:03.340 --> 43:06.060
 you know, you're gonna have a losing summer.

43:06.060 --> 43:08.780
 So you did a podcast on the mental game a few years ago,

43:08.780 --> 43:10.660
 but then that's just something you really care about.

43:10.660 --> 43:13.020
 So what aspects of the mental game in poker

43:13.020 --> 43:15.300
 is most difficult to master?

43:15.300 --> 43:16.940
 I think the most difficult thing for people

43:16.940 --> 43:18.860
 is self awareness, right?

43:18.860 --> 43:21.380
 And resilience, self awareness to know, okay,

43:21.380 --> 43:24.940
 so, you know, again, is it, am I not doing as well

43:24.940 --> 43:26.340
 as I could be because of luck

43:26.340 --> 43:28.020
 or is there things that I can learn?

43:28.020 --> 43:30.220
 And I always look to mistakes as opportunities.

43:30.220 --> 43:31.300
 I really do.

43:31.300 --> 43:34.100
 When I make a mistake in a poker hand, right?

43:34.100 --> 43:36.340
 Call it a breakdown or whatever,

43:36.340 --> 43:38.180
 that's where breakthroughs happen.

43:38.180 --> 43:40.940
 And I'm like, oh, you know what I could have done here?

43:40.940 --> 43:43.620
 I could have done this and that would have been really good

43:43.620 --> 43:44.900
 and I'm gonna do that going forward.

43:44.900 --> 43:48.060
 So I think like with anything, you know,

43:48.060 --> 43:50.060
 when you start out playing golf,

43:50.060 --> 43:52.860
 like your goal is to just hit the ball, right?

43:52.860 --> 43:54.780
 Then you try to hit it in the air,

43:54.780 --> 43:56.220
 then you're trying to hit it straight,

43:56.220 --> 43:57.980
 then you're trying to hit it on the green,

43:57.980 --> 43:59.220
 then you're trying to hit it closer to the green

43:59.220 --> 44:02.180
 to the point where the pros get where, you know,

44:02.180 --> 44:05.180
 they're so finite, they're trying to hit it 63 yards

44:05.180 --> 44:06.940
 and spin it back three yards.

44:06.940 --> 44:08.460
 It's imperfect.

44:08.460 --> 44:10.340
 Like they don't hit the perfect shot

44:10.340 --> 44:12.820
 because the perfect shot for them is it goes in,

44:12.820 --> 44:14.580
 but they try and make the mistakes smaller

44:14.580 --> 44:15.540
 and smaller and smaller.

44:15.540 --> 44:17.060
 Poker is the same.

44:17.060 --> 44:19.180
 We all make mistakes consistently.

44:19.180 --> 44:21.940
 The goal is to minimize, especially the big ones.

44:23.180 --> 44:26.340
 What was the lowest point for you psychologically

44:27.500 --> 44:28.900
 in poker in general, actually?

44:28.900 --> 44:31.220
 Maybe it was this year, maybe it was in general.

44:31.220 --> 44:33.380
 Do you remember there was times in your life,

44:33.380 --> 44:34.860
 speaking of resilience,

44:34.860 --> 44:37.660
 that were extremely difficult to you mentally?

44:37.660 --> 44:41.260
 Yeah, so early on, you know, as basically as a teenager,

44:41.260 --> 44:43.100
 I was playing in Toronto and then in my early 20s,

44:43.100 --> 44:44.780
 I'm like, I'm going to Vegas, right?

44:44.780 --> 44:46.340
 And I thought I was the best.

44:46.340 --> 44:49.620
 I'm like 21 years old, I'm like, check me out, right?

44:49.620 --> 44:54.620
 Show up with $3,000, 24 hours later, you know, money's gone.

44:54.940 --> 44:58.420
 And I remember the moment vividly.

44:58.420 --> 44:59.260
 It was at the Binion's Horse,

44:59.260 --> 45:00.580
 it was about three in the morning.

45:00.580 --> 45:02.740
 I was playing with seven other people.

45:02.740 --> 45:04.580
 You know, I lost my last chips.

45:04.580 --> 45:08.100
 I went to the bathroom, washed up, got out.

45:08.100 --> 45:09.540
 They all left.

45:09.540 --> 45:11.300
 And it was like a moment where I realized like, okay,

45:11.300 --> 45:12.900
 in Toronto, I was the big fish.

45:12.900 --> 45:15.180
 But here, they were playing because of me.

45:15.180 --> 45:16.180
 I was the sucker.

45:16.180 --> 45:17.980
 I remembered every one of their faces.

45:17.980 --> 45:19.500
 And then I remember not having enough money

45:19.500 --> 45:22.100
 to get back to budget suites where I was staying.

45:22.100 --> 45:24.980
 So I walked, you know, I walked.

45:24.980 --> 45:26.500
 And in that moment I was thinking about like,

45:26.500 --> 45:28.020
 is this something that I'll be able to do?

45:28.020 --> 45:29.340
 Am I good enough?

45:29.340 --> 45:30.700
 You know, what am I going to do now?

45:30.700 --> 45:34.020
 I'm in Vegas, I don't know anybody and I have no money,

45:34.020 --> 45:34.860
 right?

45:34.860 --> 45:37.700
 So that was certainly like what felt like a low point,

45:37.700 --> 45:40.180
 walking back behind Paradise and Twain,

45:40.180 --> 45:41.940
 which is not a great part of town.

45:43.100 --> 45:46.300
 Where did you find the strength to answer yes

45:46.300 --> 45:48.940
 to that question that you can still do good?

45:48.940 --> 45:51.100
 I think this has been sort of a pattern in my life

45:51.100 --> 45:53.580
 where like in the evening after it happens,

45:53.580 --> 45:54.780
 like I don't have it.

45:54.780 --> 45:57.700
 You know, I don't have that feeling of hope or,

45:57.700 --> 45:59.420
 you know, resilience, if you will.

45:59.420 --> 46:02.500
 I'm allowing myself to experience despair,

46:02.500 --> 46:04.260
 which is exactly where I'm at.

46:04.260 --> 46:06.980
 But then a good night's sleep, wake up the next morning

46:06.980 --> 46:10.060
 and just within me, I have that inner confidence to say,

46:10.060 --> 46:10.900
 you know what?

46:10.900 --> 46:13.180
 Fuck it, get back on the hobby horse,

46:13.180 --> 46:15.860
 find a way, make it work, right?

46:15.860 --> 46:19.060
 But I do believe it's really therapeutic and worthwhile

46:19.060 --> 46:21.740
 to allow yourself to feel and vent.

46:21.740 --> 46:24.500
 So many people today, the Instagram culture world,

46:24.500 --> 46:26.820
 I call it, it's like they want to act like they're perfect.

46:26.820 --> 46:28.860
 Nothing bothers them, bullshit, right?

46:28.860 --> 46:30.500
 You're pissed off, it's okay to show it.

46:30.500 --> 46:32.260
 Emotion's fine, we all have it.

46:32.260 --> 46:34.140
 There's no reason you have to suppress it.

46:34.140 --> 46:36.380
 Obviously, you don't want to have guys throwing selfie sticks

46:36.380 --> 46:39.060
 around the room every time they lose a pot, right?

46:39.060 --> 46:40.900
 But, you know, a little bit of...

46:40.900 --> 46:42.420
 You're gonna make everybody feel unsafe.

46:42.420 --> 46:43.260
 Yeah, exactly.

46:43.260 --> 46:44.420
 That happens.

46:44.420 --> 46:46.740
 So you're saying, there is a culture of saying,

46:46.740 --> 46:48.380
 you know, stay positive, all this kind of stuff,

46:48.380 --> 46:52.020
 but you know, when you feel despair, don't resist it,

46:52.020 --> 46:52.940
 ride it out.

46:52.940 --> 46:54.860
 Because it doesn't go away, right?

46:54.860 --> 46:56.300
 That feeling, you know, you think you put it away

46:56.300 --> 46:57.820
 in the pit of your stomach and you think, you know,

46:57.820 --> 46:59.460
 it's gone, it's not, it's still there.

46:59.460 --> 47:00.940
 Let yourself go, fuck!

47:00.940 --> 47:01.780
 Yeah.

47:01.780 --> 47:02.740
 It's all right.

47:02.740 --> 47:05.060
 You know, there's nothing wrong with being

47:05.060 --> 47:07.120
 a little bit emotional, because once you've experienced it,

47:07.120 --> 47:10.120
 you let it out, now you can move past it.

47:10.120 --> 47:12.740
 Yeah, and I feel like, as long as your brain chemistry

47:12.740 --> 47:16.620
 can support it, you can usually learn a good lesson

47:16.620 --> 47:18.660
 from it, like you become stronger,

47:18.660 --> 47:20.300
 you become more resilient through it.

47:20.300 --> 47:21.260
 It's really interesting.

47:21.260 --> 47:23.080
 And a good night's sleep can really help.

47:23.080 --> 47:24.680
 Absolutely, yeah.

47:24.680 --> 47:29.560
 So through 2022, and in general, what is a perfect day

47:29.560 --> 47:31.460
 in the life of Daniel Negrano look like

47:31.460 --> 47:34.940
 when you're, like on a day when you have to play

47:34.940 --> 47:37.620
 a big game, big tournament game and so on?

47:37.620 --> 47:39.820
 So like, what time do you wake up?

47:39.820 --> 47:41.220
 What do you eat for breakfast?

47:41.220 --> 47:43.660
 So my life is twofold.

47:43.660 --> 47:47.360
 Like one, when I'm playing hardcore, and one when I'm not.

47:47.360 --> 47:49.340
 And they look very different, right?

47:49.340 --> 47:51.860
 So I'll give you a quick glimpse of like when I'm not,

47:51.860 --> 47:55.820
 up at 10, you know, breakfast, in the gym at noon,

47:55.820 --> 47:58.780
 you know, post workout,

47:58.780 --> 48:03.780
 meal, coffee, walk, like, you know, I try to get,

48:04.460 --> 48:06.140
 that's what I do for cardio, you know,

48:06.140 --> 48:07.340
 and just very like home bodied.

48:07.340 --> 48:08.260
 I don't leave the house.

48:08.260 --> 48:10.660
 It's very like boring and mundane, right?

48:10.660 --> 48:11.580
 Long distance walks.

48:11.580 --> 48:13.060
 So like, what do you do when you're walking?

48:13.060 --> 48:14.060
 You're thinking about stuff?

48:14.060 --> 48:15.740
 Well, no, honestly, I just walk on the treadmill.

48:15.740 --> 48:17.980
 I try to get 15,000 steps a day.

48:17.980 --> 48:19.740
 And I just walk for basically like an hour

48:19.740 --> 48:21.620
 while I watch a show or I'm on the computer

48:21.620 --> 48:23.460
 or something like that, you know, I'm on the treadmill.

48:23.460 --> 48:25.580
 Why walk and not running?

48:25.580 --> 48:27.580
 Well, I mean, I think walking, I mean,

48:27.580 --> 48:29.380
 I do a little bit of running, but hardly any.

48:29.380 --> 48:30.660
 I don't enjoy it.

48:30.660 --> 48:31.900
 Like, I just like walking.

48:31.900 --> 48:33.180
 And frankly, for fat loss,

48:33.180 --> 48:36.220
 when it's usually what I'm doing after big poker tournaments

48:36.220 --> 48:40.140
 is getting back in shape, that walking's ideal for it, right?

48:40.140 --> 48:41.700
 So essentially it's like the tale of two.

48:41.700 --> 48:43.580
 During the World Series of Poker,

48:43.580 --> 48:47.740
 all my sort of structured life thrown out the window.

48:47.740 --> 48:48.860
 There's no walking.

48:48.860 --> 48:50.180
 There's very little walking.

48:50.180 --> 48:51.340
 There's very little working out.

48:51.340 --> 48:52.180
 There's very little anything.

48:52.180 --> 48:54.140
 I go into the World Series, you know,

48:54.140 --> 48:57.460
 like this year I went in around 157

48:57.460 --> 48:59.420
 and I expected to gain about 10 pounds

48:59.420 --> 49:00.260
 during the World Series.

49:00.260 --> 49:01.940
 Not good pounds, it wasn't muscle,

49:01.940 --> 49:03.700
 but that's about what I did, 165.

49:03.700 --> 49:06.580
 And then I spend the next month trying to, you know, lose it.

49:06.580 --> 49:08.500
 But during the World Series, when I'm playing,

49:08.500 --> 49:10.860
 the most important thing without question

49:10.860 --> 49:12.060
 that I have to focus on,

49:12.060 --> 49:13.980
 and this is why I stopped focusing

49:13.980 --> 49:16.460
 on working on all this stuff is sleep.

49:16.460 --> 49:18.380
 If I'm not rested, I'm useless.

49:18.380 --> 49:20.380
 If I only get five, six hours

49:20.380 --> 49:23.500
 and I have to go back the next day and play 14 hours,

49:23.500 --> 49:26.460
 the chances of me being at my best, very, very slim.

49:26.460 --> 49:27.500
 So sleep is a priority.

49:27.500 --> 49:30.060
 What's the perfect amount of sleep for you on those days?

49:30.060 --> 49:30.900
 Eight, seven?

49:30.900 --> 49:33.980
 So eight hours is my go to every night.

49:33.980 --> 49:36.540
 During the World Series of Poker, it's just not possible

49:36.540 --> 49:37.900
 because of the way that it's structured.

49:37.900 --> 49:40.980
 Sometimes the tournaments end at 2.15 a.m.

49:40.980 --> 49:44.340
 I get home about three o clock.

49:44.340 --> 49:46.900
 Takes me 30 minutes, 40 minutes to get to sleep.

49:46.900 --> 49:48.780
 So now let's say I'm in bed by four.

49:48.780 --> 49:51.660
 Well, the tournament's at, you know, two.

49:51.660 --> 49:53.540
 So I have to get up and whatever.

49:53.540 --> 49:55.060
 So it's very difficult to get exactly eight

49:55.060 --> 49:56.100
 a lot of the time.

49:56.100 --> 49:57.660
 You know, and also get back there in time.

49:57.660 --> 50:01.380
 Is there any hacks to quiet the mind?

50:01.380 --> 50:04.580
 Because you're going on a pretty intense rollercoaster

50:04.580 --> 50:06.500
 mentally when you're playing.

50:07.780 --> 50:10.100
 Is there any tricks to getting to sleep

50:10.100 --> 50:10.940
 given the rollercoaster?

50:10.940 --> 50:12.060
 I've been very lucky.

50:12.060 --> 50:12.900
 Like I'm blessed.

50:12.900 --> 50:14.700
 I don't know if it's because of diet or what,

50:14.700 --> 50:16.700
 but I've always been a very good sleeper.

50:16.700 --> 50:17.580
 You just shut off.

50:17.580 --> 50:19.980
 I get to sleep and I sleep like a baby, you know?

50:19.980 --> 50:21.840
 And I also nap really well.

50:21.840 --> 50:23.660
 Like during the World Series, sometimes what will happen

50:23.660 --> 50:26.340
 is let's say I get knocked out of one event at 4 p.m.

50:26.340 --> 50:28.460
 And there's another one that I can jump in.

50:28.460 --> 50:30.100
 Instead of jumping right into it,

50:30.100 --> 50:34.220
 I'll go into like a private room and take 45 minute nap.

50:34.220 --> 50:36.980
 And you know, and give me enough energy to continue

50:36.980 --> 50:38.300
 and sort of reset my mind.

50:38.300 --> 50:41.060
 Yeah, and it solves a lot of problems with the nap too.

50:41.060 --> 50:41.900
 It does.

50:41.900 --> 50:46.180
 Yeah, I feel like the nap is a magical trick in life.

50:46.180 --> 50:47.540
 What else, diet wise?

50:47.540 --> 50:52.220
 What do you, your mind is going, you know,

50:52.220 --> 50:53.980
 pretty intensely all day.

50:53.980 --> 50:55.860
 Yeah, so during like, like I said,

50:55.860 --> 50:58.740
 when I'm not playing, I'm super regimented.

50:58.740 --> 51:01.740
 You know, I have, I literally measure everything.

51:01.740 --> 51:04.420
 You know, I count calories, I count macros,

51:04.420 --> 51:05.900
 I follow it to a T.

51:05.900 --> 51:07.420
 Pretty balanced diet or any?

51:07.420 --> 51:08.260
 I'm a vegan.

51:08.260 --> 51:09.100
 Vegan, yeah.

51:09.100 --> 51:10.540
 So it's, you know, a vegan diet, like.

51:10.540 --> 51:12.140
 But balanced in terms of carbs and protein.

51:12.140 --> 51:13.980
 Yeah, yeah, no, I mean, I eat a healthy amount.

51:13.980 --> 51:16.820
 I'm doing probably 150 grams of protein,

51:17.820 --> 51:20.140
 like 60 grams of fat, 50, and then about.

51:20.140 --> 51:21.460
 And try to measure it all out.

51:21.460 --> 51:23.460
 I do, yeah, I basically, I created a meal plan.

51:23.460 --> 51:24.700
 So what I did for myself is,

51:24.700 --> 51:26.780
 cause I'm really anal and I made a spreadsheet

51:26.780 --> 51:29.660
 with like a day's food and I have six different ones.

51:29.660 --> 51:30.940
 So I just follow it.

51:30.940 --> 51:34.580
 Like I don't, it actually makes my life so much easier

51:34.580 --> 51:35.860
 when I don't have to think about what I'm going to eat

51:35.860 --> 51:37.060
 for lunch or what I'm going to eat for dinner.

51:37.060 --> 51:38.100
 I already know what I'm going to eat.

51:38.100 --> 51:40.300
 I already wrote it down and it doesn't get boring

51:40.300 --> 51:42.460
 because I'm switching it up every day, you know,

51:42.460 --> 51:45.140
 every six days and occasionally I'll, you know,

51:45.140 --> 51:46.300
 splurge or do something different.

51:46.300 --> 51:47.900
 During the World Series of Poker,

51:47.900 --> 51:50.140
 I eat whatever the fuck I want to eat.

51:50.140 --> 51:52.820
 Like it's at 2 a.m. I don't crave

51:52.820 --> 51:54.900
 like a broccoli carrot salad.

51:54.900 --> 51:58.660
 Like I want chocolate, candy and chips.

51:58.660 --> 51:59.500
 So I'll just do it.

51:59.500 --> 52:01.340
 So you listen to the cravings.

52:01.340 --> 52:02.900
 Yeah, I realized like.

52:02.900 --> 52:04.180
 It's surprising because like,

52:04.180 --> 52:06.580
 you're so regimented outside of that.

52:06.580 --> 52:07.740
 It's really difficult.

52:07.740 --> 52:08.860
 Like I've done it before

52:08.860 --> 52:10.420
 where I played the World Series of Poker

52:10.420 --> 52:13.140
 and I made it a point to work out every day.

52:13.140 --> 52:15.780
 But what that did was it sacrificed sleep.

52:15.780 --> 52:18.780
 So then I found like at 1 a.m. I would be more tired,

52:18.780 --> 52:20.620
 you know, because I've expended more energy

52:20.620 --> 52:21.460
 than I would otherwise.

52:21.460 --> 52:23.740
 So I essentially like look at the World Series

52:23.740 --> 52:25.220
 is six, seven weeks where my body's

52:25.220 --> 52:27.940
 just gonna take a beating, not like UFC fighter,

52:27.940 --> 52:29.380
 but like a different kind of beating.

52:29.380 --> 52:31.620
 And that's okay because I have so much confidence

52:31.620 --> 52:34.980
 that within six weeks of just like eating right

52:34.980 --> 52:36.820
 and working out, I can get back to where I was.

52:36.820 --> 52:39.100
 But it's just hilarious to me that you'd be eating chocolate.

52:39.100 --> 52:40.420
 What eating chocolate in bed

52:40.420 --> 52:42.820
 as you're trying to get to sleep is this.

52:42.820 --> 52:45.580
 Like literally a bag of like chips or chocolate,

52:45.580 --> 52:48.260
 like on my way home and before bed,

52:48.260 --> 52:49.300
 you know, just whatever.

52:49.300 --> 52:51.340
 This is what the professional athlete does

52:51.340 --> 52:54.060
 at the highest, most difficult event of his career.

52:54.060 --> 52:58.620
 Okay, so what else is there in terms of mental preparation

52:58.620 --> 53:01.380
 and focus and meditation, those kinds of things

53:01.380 --> 53:03.100
 leading up to the games?

53:03.100 --> 53:05.260
 Is there anything you like to,

53:05.260 --> 53:07.860
 like any rituals you like to follow?

53:07.860 --> 53:10.100
 So yeah, I have dabbled in the past

53:10.100 --> 53:11.740
 with like meditation and different things like that.

53:11.740 --> 53:13.540
 And I know that there's health benefits to it.

53:13.540 --> 53:16.340
 And I understand that a lot of people get a lot from it

53:16.340 --> 53:18.540
 and I've done it for a good amount of time,

53:18.540 --> 53:20.340
 like long periods of time.

53:20.340 --> 53:23.740
 I found that for me, I think it was predominantly placebo.

53:23.740 --> 53:26.380
 Like it really wasn't doing anything for me

53:26.380 --> 53:28.540
 that I felt like it was, it felt like I was doing something,

53:28.540 --> 53:31.860
 but I really, I didn't see any specific results from it.

53:31.860 --> 53:33.980
 So I don't really do that too much.

53:33.980 --> 53:37.340
 One thing that I will do for me is leading up

53:37.340 --> 53:39.260
 is there's so much footage now

53:39.260 --> 53:42.260
 that I'll make it a point to like watch my opponents

53:42.260 --> 53:45.620
 and then with like my phone, I'll take notes

53:45.620 --> 53:47.980
 and I'll keep track of different things that I'm seeing.

53:47.980 --> 53:49.500
 And that sort of, and then what I'll do

53:49.500 --> 53:50.940
 is I'll formulate a game plan.

53:50.940 --> 53:52.940
 Like I'm playing the Poker Masters coming up

53:52.940 --> 53:54.100
 in about a week.

53:54.100 --> 53:55.900
 And I'll look to see the tendencies

53:55.900 --> 53:56.780
 of what my opponents are doing.

53:56.780 --> 53:58.540
 And then I'll come up with like some things

53:58.540 --> 54:00.500
 that I'm gonna do, some tricks of the trade, if you will.

54:00.500 --> 54:02.380
 Not game theory optimal stuff,

54:02.380 --> 54:04.540
 stuff that I think, oh, they're making a mistake here

54:04.540 --> 54:05.900
 that I can exploit.

54:05.900 --> 54:07.900
 And then I look to do that in different ways

54:07.900 --> 54:11.700
 and always look to throw curve balls.

54:11.700 --> 54:14.220
 How hard is that process?

54:14.220 --> 54:16.180
 Do you enjoy it or is it like really hard work

54:16.180 --> 54:18.980
 to analyze the players to try to understand

54:18.980 --> 54:20.100
 what are the different holes?

54:20.100 --> 54:21.100
 What are the different mistakes?

54:21.100 --> 54:23.700
 What are the strengths to avoid and that kind of stuff?

54:23.700 --> 54:25.580
 I think the only thing that makes it harder

54:25.580 --> 54:27.340
 is when you're young, right?

54:27.340 --> 54:28.180
 And you're in your twenties

54:28.180 --> 54:29.820
 and you're trying to make your nest egg.

54:29.820 --> 54:31.700
 You're like, you're trying to make your retirement money.

54:31.700 --> 54:32.860
 You're hungry, right?

54:32.860 --> 54:35.380
 You're like clubber Lang and you know the gym, you're hungry.

54:35.380 --> 54:37.380
 Whereas, you know, Rocky's in there taking pictures

54:37.380 --> 54:39.860
 and smiling and doing commercials and stuff like that.

54:39.860 --> 54:42.380
 So I am 47, I'm financially okay.

54:42.380 --> 54:44.020
 I don't need to win.

54:44.020 --> 54:46.140
 I don't need to compete at the highest levels.

54:46.140 --> 54:47.540
 So I think it was a boxer.

54:47.540 --> 54:48.900
 I don't remember which one.

54:48.900 --> 54:51.500
 When asked this, he was asked the question,

54:51.500 --> 54:53.020
 how do you get up in the morning still

54:53.020 --> 54:54.660
 and do those morning runs?

54:54.660 --> 54:55.500
 And he says, you know what?

54:55.500 --> 54:56.460
 I'll be honest with you.

54:56.460 --> 54:58.780
 It's a lot more difficult doing the 4 a.m. run

54:58.780 --> 55:00.700
 in silk pajamas, right?

55:00.700 --> 55:02.020
 It just is, right?

55:02.020 --> 55:05.700
 But I've always been self motivated

55:05.700 --> 55:07.020
 and I've always found a way.

55:07.020 --> 55:10.900
 So it's harder in the sense of like, it's not a need.

55:10.900 --> 55:12.940
 I can still get by without it.

55:12.940 --> 55:15.540
 But so in that regard, it does feel like a little bit

55:15.540 --> 55:16.700
 of work where like, oh my God,

55:16.700 --> 55:18.900
 that's a lot of footage I gotta get through.

55:18.900 --> 55:20.300
 And I don't know that I have the time or I don't know

55:20.300 --> 55:23.980
 that I wanna spend 10 hours of my day doing that

55:23.980 --> 55:25.620
 when I could be doing other things.

55:25.620 --> 55:28.980
 I mean, what do you still love about poker?

55:28.980 --> 55:30.500
 When you said, when you enter,

55:30.500 --> 55:34.380
 like the times you catch yourself just being able

55:34.380 --> 55:37.820
 to sort of take in the awe of it.

55:37.820 --> 55:39.260
 What aspects do you love?

55:39.260 --> 55:40.380
 I think that like for me,

55:40.380 --> 55:42.100
 I've always been really competitive,

55:42.100 --> 55:44.060
 but I was never gonna be a professional athlete

55:44.060 --> 55:45.140
 or a professional snooker player.

55:45.140 --> 55:46.740
 I wasn't good enough at any of that stuff.

55:46.740 --> 55:49.100
 I didn't have the body type, whatever.

55:49.100 --> 55:51.540
 But poker, it sort of levels the playing field, right?

55:51.540 --> 55:54.220
 You're six, five, 240, big deal.

55:54.220 --> 55:55.860
 We're not fighting here.

55:55.860 --> 55:57.540
 We're fighting a different type of war.

55:57.540 --> 55:58.940
 So the competitive aspect,

55:58.940 --> 56:02.660
 I also have always been fueled throughout my career

56:02.660 --> 56:04.180
 by doubters.

56:04.180 --> 56:05.660
 So this is probably unhealthy,

56:05.660 --> 56:09.020
 but every time people say like, you're done,

56:09.020 --> 56:10.460
 you're washed up, you can't win anymore,

56:10.460 --> 56:13.580
 it just makes me wanna prove them wrong, right?

56:13.580 --> 56:15.260
 So I have a little bit of that in me,

56:15.260 --> 56:17.060
 which again, you're reading the comments

56:17.060 --> 56:17.900
 and all these kinds of,

56:17.900 --> 56:19.680
 like I've been told many times throughout my career

56:19.680 --> 56:21.180
 for the last 15 that I'm done.

56:21.180 --> 56:22.540
 I can't compete anymore.

56:22.540 --> 56:27.260
 And I enjoy proving them wrong.

56:27.260 --> 56:29.940
 Yeah, the game has changed so much.

56:31.780 --> 56:34.340
 The greats of the past surely cannot be the greats

56:34.340 --> 56:35.180
 of the present.

56:35.180 --> 56:38.820
 That kind of commentary will continue for every sport.

56:38.820 --> 56:40.020
 And certainly for poker,

56:40.020 --> 56:42.100
 because poker really changed a lot

56:42.100 --> 56:43.700
 over the past couple of decades.

56:43.700 --> 56:45.660
 Can you speak to how much it has changed?

56:45.660 --> 56:46.500
 Yeah.

56:46.500 --> 56:47.420
 Because you've been at the top for so long.

56:47.420 --> 56:49.380
 Yeah, so complacency is a big issue

56:49.380 --> 56:51.360
 for people who make it, if you will, right?

56:51.360 --> 56:54.300
 So in my era of the poker boom, around the early 2000s,

56:54.300 --> 56:56.500
 there was a group of players who were the big names,

56:56.500 --> 56:57.700
 the stars of the game.

56:57.700 --> 57:01.380
 Well, a lot of them had their egos out of whack

57:01.380 --> 57:03.920
 where they just felt like, okay, I'm the best, that's it.

57:03.920 --> 57:05.620
 Like, no, there's young guys learning,

57:05.620 --> 57:07.900
 there's new software, there's solvers,

57:07.900 --> 57:08.740
 there's all these kinds of things.

57:08.740 --> 57:11.100
 And if you're not keeping up, then you'll get surpassed.

57:11.100 --> 57:14.140
 And I remember myself at a very early age saying,

57:14.140 --> 57:15.300
 I never want to be that guy.

57:15.300 --> 57:17.820
 And it was one of my first events in the late 90s.

57:17.820 --> 57:21.020
 I was the young buck playing with the Tom McAvoy's

57:21.020 --> 57:23.500
 and Brad Doughty, the guys of the era, right?

57:23.500 --> 57:25.420
 And I was doing things more aggressively

57:25.420 --> 57:27.900
 and they were scoffing at all these young kids

57:27.900 --> 57:29.900
 with their aggressive three and all this stuff.

57:29.900 --> 57:31.120
 And they were sort of mocking it, you know?

57:31.120 --> 57:33.180
 And I thought, never be that guy.

57:33.180 --> 57:35.920
 Always have the humility to be introspective

57:35.920 --> 57:38.140
 and always have the respect for your opponents

57:38.140 --> 57:41.180
 that while you think you've got it all figured out,

57:41.180 --> 57:43.340
 they're learning new things and you can learn from them.

57:43.340 --> 57:46.540
 So I've always been willing to sort of swallow my pride

57:46.540 --> 57:48.780
 and get coached by younger players

57:48.780 --> 57:50.240
 who I might even be better than,

57:50.240 --> 57:53.260
 but they see blind spots that I have that I might not.

57:53.260 --> 57:55.220
 And they, you know, they helped me improve my game.

57:55.220 --> 57:57.900
 I've always been willing to sort of look every six months

57:57.900 --> 57:59.300
 or a year and say, is what I'm doing working?

57:59.300 --> 58:01.620
 And if not, how do I get better?

58:01.620 --> 58:06.320
 But most people from my generation, they go the other way.

58:06.320 --> 58:07.420
 I don't know, they just have this idea

58:07.420 --> 58:08.260
 that they figured it all out.

58:08.260 --> 58:10.020
 Once you feel like you've mastered it,

58:10.020 --> 58:10.860
 there's nothing left to learn.

58:10.860 --> 58:12.540
 That's the moment where everyone else

58:12.540 --> 58:13.640
 starts to surpass you.

58:14.820 --> 58:17.780
 That's the moment where you lose the mastery

58:17.780 --> 58:18.860
 because it's always evolving.

58:18.860 --> 58:20.660
 How has the game changed?

58:20.660 --> 58:21.620
 So the game has changed

58:21.620 --> 58:23.780
 in terms of the way people learn it, right?

58:23.780 --> 58:25.660
 When I started out, the only way to learn how to play poker

58:25.660 --> 58:28.380
 was to sit your ass on the chair and play.

58:28.380 --> 58:29.200
 In person?

58:29.200 --> 58:31.060
 Yes, in person, play.

58:31.060 --> 58:32.820
 Maybe you jot down hands on a notepad.

58:32.820 --> 58:34.740
 We didn't even have cell phones back then, right?

58:34.740 --> 58:36.380
 So I would write notes.

58:36.380 --> 58:37.860
 I actually brought a notepad.

58:37.860 --> 58:39.100
 And then you don't analyze it

58:39.100 --> 58:41.340
 and sort of try to figure it out that way

58:41.340 --> 58:44.580
 and think about maybe talking to friends

58:44.580 --> 58:45.520
 and different players.

58:45.520 --> 58:47.220
 Like when I grew up, there was John Jawanda,

58:47.220 --> 58:48.700
 Alan Cunningham and Phil Ivey.

58:48.700 --> 58:50.580
 And we would sort of create

58:50.580 --> 58:52.220
 like a little bit of a mastermind.

58:52.220 --> 58:53.220
 Well, how would you play this hand?

58:53.220 --> 58:54.060
 What would you do here?

58:54.060 --> 58:56.080
 That was the extent of it, right?

58:56.080 --> 58:57.900
 We never had the correct answers.

58:57.900 --> 59:00.480
 We always had theories about what might be right.

59:00.480 --> 59:03.180
 Not until about five, six years ago

59:03.180 --> 59:04.580
 where everything changed.

59:04.580 --> 59:07.500
 Where artificial intelligence created solvers

59:07.500 --> 59:11.020
 that will specifically say, okay, this is the optimal play.

59:11.020 --> 59:12.780
 This is the game theory optimal play.

59:12.780 --> 59:16.180
 So now it introduced poker to a whole new group

59:16.180 --> 59:18.500
 of like personality types.

59:18.500 --> 59:21.440
 In my day, it was people that were dregs of society

59:21.440 --> 59:24.220
 that didn't fit in, not college goers with a degree.

59:24.220 --> 59:26.540
 These are people who were street hustlers playing pool.

59:26.540 --> 59:29.640
 They found poker and they had these unique lives, right?

59:29.640 --> 59:32.740
 But now because poker can be studied,

59:32.740 --> 59:35.300
 much like you study university or college,

59:35.300 --> 59:37.440
 you had, for example, the German contingent

59:37.440 --> 59:39.300
 who was literally analyzing data

59:39.300 --> 59:41.300
 and coming up with strategies based on this.

59:41.300 --> 59:42.620
 And it's like, what?

59:42.620 --> 59:45.780
 And the old guy, got to play by feel or whatever.

59:45.780 --> 59:47.340
 And they're like, they're learning.

59:47.340 --> 59:49.460
 So I guess the way that you describe it is like

59:49.460 --> 59:52.140
 in the old days, it required skill and talent,

59:52.140 --> 59:53.860
 a card sense, right?

59:53.860 --> 59:55.100
 That was the only way to become good.

59:55.100 --> 59:56.960
 And today that's not the case.

59:56.960 --> 59:59.540
 Good study habits, a good work ethic in that regard

59:59.540 --> 1:00:01.220
 can make you like a really good player.

1:00:01.220 --> 1:00:05.020
 Even if you aren't all that talented or gifted,

1:00:05.020 --> 1:00:07.460
 having a good work ethic is a talent, right?

1:00:07.460 --> 1:00:09.860
 Not necessarily card sense, but if you're able to put

1:00:09.860 --> 1:00:12.180
 in the work and study from these solvers,

1:00:12.180 --> 1:00:15.420
 you essentially have the perfect study tool now

1:00:15.420 --> 1:00:17.160
 that we didn't have in my day.

1:00:17.160 --> 1:00:19.900
 So what do the solvers give you?

1:00:19.900 --> 1:00:22.120
 Do you start to memorize the optimal play

1:00:22.120 --> 1:00:24.120
 for every single hand?

1:00:24.120 --> 1:00:25.300
 You try your best.

1:00:25.300 --> 1:00:28.720
 So again, solvers are imperfect as well,

1:00:28.720 --> 1:00:32.700
 in terms of the way the humans utilize them, right?

1:00:32.700 --> 1:00:36.860
 Because you can give solvers a certain number of inputs

1:00:36.860 --> 1:00:38.500
 in terms of what you want it to solve,

1:00:38.500 --> 1:00:40.900
 but a solver can think on many, many levels.

1:00:40.900 --> 1:00:43.240
 So for example, the way that a typical player

1:00:43.240 --> 1:00:45.580
 would do a solve is to say, okay,

1:00:45.580 --> 1:00:47.860
 what does a solver think is the best play here?

1:00:47.860 --> 1:00:50.700
 Bet one third pot, bet two thirds pot,

1:00:50.700 --> 1:00:52.580
 or bet one and a half times pot, okay?

1:00:52.580 --> 1:00:55.820
 You give it three parameters, it comes out with an output

1:00:55.820 --> 1:00:57.420
 and it tells you what you should do

1:00:57.420 --> 1:00:59.320
 with all the different hands you have.

1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:01.820
 However, that's a simplified version

1:01:01.820 --> 1:01:02.940
 of what a solver would really do,

1:01:02.940 --> 1:01:04.580
 because a solver might decide

1:01:04.580 --> 1:01:08.100
 that seven times the pot is best, 10% of the pot.

1:01:08.100 --> 1:01:09.860
 But when you're putting in a solve,

1:01:09.860 --> 1:01:12.540
 you can only put in specific parameters.

1:01:12.540 --> 1:01:14.900
 So that's why, frankly, that's typically the number,

1:01:14.900 --> 1:01:17.140
 one third, two third, and one and a half times pot

1:01:17.140 --> 1:01:18.500
 is what people often do.

1:01:18.500 --> 1:01:21.860
 So they sort of have a vague idea of what a solver wants.

1:01:21.860 --> 1:01:26.660
 But again, imperfect in terms of the implementation of it.

1:01:26.660 --> 1:01:29.060
 And memorizing all the variables,

1:01:29.060 --> 1:01:31.780
 like that King Jack offsuit with the King of Diamonds

1:01:31.780 --> 1:01:35.800
 is 13%, no human brain can do that.

1:01:35.800 --> 1:01:37.500
 So what you do is you bucket it.

1:01:37.500 --> 1:01:41.000
 Like you bucket it into say, instead of 10,000 variables,

1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:42.580
 you have 10 buckets and you say, okay,

1:01:42.580 --> 1:01:44.100
 with these hands, we do roughly this,

1:01:44.100 --> 1:01:45.140
 and we do roughly this.

1:01:45.140 --> 1:01:48.260
 And you try your best to stay within those lines.

1:01:48.260 --> 1:01:50.460
 But again, what I love about live poker partly

1:01:50.460 --> 1:01:54.560
 is that nobody will ever be able to master game theory,

1:01:54.560 --> 1:01:57.800
 and mimic a solver.

1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:02.800
 But you also have to incorporate your position,

1:02:03.080 --> 1:02:06.460
 where you are, and obviously what cards you have,

1:02:06.460 --> 1:02:08.920
 but also the size of your stack,

1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:09.920
 how much money you have,

1:02:09.920 --> 1:02:12.440
 and also whether you have the ability

1:02:12.440 --> 1:02:15.460
 or desire to buy in, all those kinds of things.

1:02:15.460 --> 1:02:17.600
 So you have to calculate all of that, right?

1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:20.440
 So the solver will do that, right?

1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:23.120
 And essentially, you don't input your hand.

1:02:23.120 --> 1:02:25.600
 It tells you, you'll look at the grade,

1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:27.320
 and be like, all right, this is my hand,

1:02:27.320 --> 1:02:28.160
 and it tells you what it is.

1:02:28.160 --> 1:02:30.960
 But it tells you what you would do with any hand, right?

1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:32.280
 It gives you the full output.

1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:34.040
 And that actually gives you a better idea,

1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:36.800
 because you're ultimately, like you said,

1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:39.400
 playing a range of hands, not a hand.

1:02:39.400 --> 1:02:41.240
 And the solvers do things that are really interesting.

1:02:41.240 --> 1:02:43.040
 You've seen AlphaGo, I would imagine.

1:02:43.040 --> 1:02:44.680
 Brilliant film, right, I thought.

1:02:44.680 --> 1:02:46.920
 And I thought what was interesting is there was,

1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:50.280
 you know, accepted theory from all the top Go players,

1:02:50.280 --> 1:02:51.160
 this is what you do.

1:02:51.160 --> 1:02:54.360
 But the AI was doing things way different,

1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:55.720
 and they're like, this has to be wrong,

1:02:55.720 --> 1:02:56.880
 but really it wasn't.

1:02:56.880 --> 1:03:00.760
 So for example, a solver may say this, right?

1:03:00.760 --> 1:03:04.360
 Let's say you bet on the end, and you bet a lot,

1:03:04.360 --> 1:03:07.460
 and a solver may say, you should fold here

1:03:07.460 --> 1:03:10.040
 with a pair of kings and a queen kicker,

1:03:10.040 --> 1:03:12.000
 which is, you know, a pair of kings,

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:15.080
 but call with a pair of fours and an ace kicker.

1:03:15.080 --> 1:03:16.900
 So it's essentially telling you

1:03:16.900 --> 1:03:18.800
 that you should fold this hand

1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:20.080
 that is much better than this.

1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:23.160
 So it begs the question, why?

1:03:23.160 --> 1:03:27.000
 Because what the solvers do is they use the information

1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:30.400
 of your own cards to formulate all the possible hands

1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:32.080
 your opponent can have.

1:03:32.080 --> 1:03:34.160
 So if your opponent is,

1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:36.640
 so basically if you had the king, queen,

1:03:36.640 --> 1:03:41.640
 you know, it may say, for lack of a better nerdy term,

1:03:41.760 --> 1:03:43.480
 it blocks potential bluffing hands

1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:44.680
 that your opponent can have.

1:03:44.680 --> 1:03:47.760
 So let's say if your opponent would bluff with queen, jack,

1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:49.160
 but you have a queen.

1:03:49.160 --> 1:03:51.320
 So there are less combinations of queen, jack.

1:03:51.320 --> 1:03:54.200
 So it will find a better bluff catcher, if you will.

1:03:54.200 --> 1:03:56.560
 So that's what's really not intuitive to poker players.

1:03:56.560 --> 1:03:58.040
 Poker players usually think like,

1:03:58.040 --> 1:04:00.820
 well, this, my hand is pretty good, so I got a call,

1:04:00.820 --> 1:04:02.600
 but that's not how a solver would think.

1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:06.920
 Solver uses, you know, common matrix and, you know.

1:04:06.920 --> 1:04:10.620
 And sometimes it's tough to get the good why answers

1:04:10.620 --> 1:04:13.320
 you just did for why a solver thinks something is better,

1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:14.880
 or maybe in poker it's a little bit easier,

1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:18.880
 but in the case of go and chess, it's not always obvious why,

1:04:18.880 --> 1:04:20.560
 because it's not gonna explain stuff to you.

1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:23.480
 I think one of the best ways to learn poker

1:04:23.480 --> 1:04:25.120
 is when you see a solver output

1:04:25.120 --> 1:04:28.280
 and it tells you one of these things, try to figure out why.

1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:30.040
 Why does this solver do this?

1:04:30.040 --> 1:04:32.440
 Why does it want you to call with this and fold this?

1:04:32.440 --> 1:04:34.200
 And try to think about it on a deeper level.

1:04:34.200 --> 1:04:36.860
 And you go, aha, probably because this card

1:04:36.860 --> 1:04:39.720
 that I have here, you know, changes the range

1:04:39.720 --> 1:04:42.600
 of my opponent's, you know, potential.

1:04:42.600 --> 1:04:43.960
 I'd love to get your opinion

1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:45.600
 on your relationship with solvers.

1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:47.960
 Because for example, Magnus doesn't use them.

1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:49.400
 His team uses them.

1:04:49.400 --> 1:04:54.200
 Cause he feels like he's going to rely on it too much.

1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:57.120
 And you can't use it when you're playing.

1:04:57.120 --> 1:04:58.840
 What you really want is to build up

1:04:58.840 --> 1:05:02.780
 an extremely strong intuition without the help of a solver.

1:05:02.780 --> 1:05:04.920
 Is there some aspect of that that rings true to you?

1:05:04.920 --> 1:05:05.740
 Absolutely.

1:05:05.740 --> 1:05:07.080
 I totally can relate to what Magnus is saying.

1:05:07.080 --> 1:05:08.640
 First and foremost, because when solvers

1:05:08.640 --> 1:05:11.120
 was first introduced, I didn't come from that world.

1:05:11.120 --> 1:05:13.640
 I was so intimidated because I didn't know how to use it.

1:05:13.640 --> 1:05:15.400
 I don't know how to do an input.

1:05:15.400 --> 1:05:17.560
 So I had two guys, one guy's a data scientist

1:05:17.560 --> 1:05:20.000
 and, you know, another guy's like a poker savant,

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:22.520
 if you will, and they coached me and they did it.

1:05:22.520 --> 1:05:25.720
 So today, if I was in a tough spot, you know,

1:05:25.720 --> 1:05:27.120
 and I'm like, I don't know, what would a solver do?

1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:30.980
 I will send them the hand and they'll run the solve for me.

1:05:30.980 --> 1:05:33.360
 And then sort of give me the parameters of what to do.

1:05:33.360 --> 1:05:34.920
 When I was playing, you know,

1:05:34.920 --> 1:05:36.720
 regularly using solvers with them,

1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:38.240
 we were spending six to eight hours a day

1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:40.320
 going over all these solves.

1:05:40.320 --> 1:05:42.760
 So intuitively I started to think and learn

1:05:42.760 --> 1:05:44.100
 about what the solver would want,

1:05:44.100 --> 1:05:46.080
 but I sort of understand where Magnus is coming from

1:05:46.080 --> 1:05:48.320
 in that you don't want to become a slave to the sim,

1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:49.760
 as I say, right?

1:05:49.760 --> 1:05:51.680
 There's one kid I know, I joked with him,

1:05:51.680 --> 1:05:53.160
 his name is Landon Tice.

1:05:53.160 --> 1:05:56.200
 And, you know, he made a play that the sim, you know,

1:05:56.200 --> 1:05:57.880
 would say, this is a good play.

1:05:57.880 --> 1:06:00.080
 But I'm like, it's a good play, you know,

1:06:00.080 --> 1:06:01.840
 in a simulated world against the robot.

1:06:01.840 --> 1:06:05.120
 It's not in practice against the human, right?

1:06:05.120 --> 1:06:06.660
 You don't need to be doing that.

1:06:06.660 --> 1:06:08.760
 So if you become a slave to the sim

1:06:08.760 --> 1:06:10.640
 and always do what the sim says,

1:06:10.640 --> 1:06:13.080
 you're handcuffed to a certain degree.

1:06:13.080 --> 1:06:16.040
 Is there some, at the highest level plays,

1:06:16.040 --> 1:06:19.520
 there's still a role for feel and intuition?

1:06:19.520 --> 1:06:20.360
 Absolutely.

1:06:20.360 --> 1:06:21.200
 If you're not doing that,

1:06:21.200 --> 1:06:22.760
 cause here's the thing, right?

1:06:22.760 --> 1:06:25.600
 No human being plays perfectly balanced

1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:27.640
 in game three optimal like a robot would.

1:06:27.640 --> 1:06:29.200
 They're not, right?

1:06:29.200 --> 1:06:31.000
 So there are opportunities there to take advantage

1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:34.360
 of the things that they do that are slightly too aggressive

1:06:34.360 --> 1:06:35.840
 or less aggressive.

1:06:35.840 --> 1:06:37.200
 You know, for example,

1:06:37.200 --> 1:06:41.120
 say most human beings don't bluff enough in a certain spot.

1:06:41.120 --> 1:06:44.680
 So you don't have to call with the correct range of hands.

1:06:44.680 --> 1:06:45.640
 You don't have to,

1:06:45.640 --> 1:06:48.040
 because they're not bluffing at the optimal frequency.

1:06:48.040 --> 1:06:50.520
 So you don't have to call at the optimal frequency.

1:06:50.520 --> 1:06:53.880
 You'd be making this mistake, frankly, if you did.

1:06:53.880 --> 1:06:58.520
 What's the difference between in person and online play,

1:06:58.520 --> 1:06:59.560
 given that context?

1:06:59.560 --> 1:07:02.040
 Yeah, well, online poker and live poker,

1:07:02.040 --> 1:07:03.400
 it's the same game, right?

1:07:03.400 --> 1:07:04.240
 Same, it's poker,

1:07:04.240 --> 1:07:06.480
 but it's different in so many levels, right?

1:07:07.840 --> 1:07:08.880
 I think playing online,

1:07:08.880 --> 1:07:11.040
 you have to focus far more on fundamentals.

1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:12.200
 You know, on game theory,

1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:14.960
 you don't have the added bonus of looking across the table

1:07:14.960 --> 1:07:17.040
 and getting any sense of whether your opponent

1:07:17.040 --> 1:07:20.280
 is strong or weak, they're bluffing, whatever, you know.

1:07:20.280 --> 1:07:24.680
 And also because online poker, those that play it,

1:07:24.680 --> 1:07:26.720
 you play far more hands.

1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:28.880
 Like some of these guys are playing 10, 20 tables

1:07:28.880 --> 1:07:30.440
 at the same time, right?

1:07:30.440 --> 1:07:32.400
 So you're just, you're hitting the long run really quickly

1:07:32.400 --> 1:07:35.080
 and you're creating a database on your opponents, right?

1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:37.520
 So let's say, you know, online, I can see your data.

1:07:37.520 --> 1:07:40.480
 I'm like, well, this guy, he's playing 40% of hands.

1:07:40.480 --> 1:07:43.240
 He's betting the river 80% of the time.

1:07:43.240 --> 1:07:45.560
 So now I can use that data and, you know,

1:07:45.560 --> 1:07:46.400
 exploit you that way.

1:07:46.400 --> 1:07:49.000
 When you play live, you don't have that.

1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.160
 Do you enjoy playing online?

1:07:51.160 --> 1:07:54.400
 I enjoy, so with online poker, I enjoy the convenience of it

1:07:54.400 --> 1:07:55.720
 because, you know, you can be on your couch

1:07:55.720 --> 1:07:57.400
 in your underwear, not leave your house.

1:07:57.400 --> 1:08:00.080
 Do you also play multiple games at the same time

1:08:00.080 --> 1:08:01.520
 or do you try to play one game?

1:08:01.520 --> 1:08:03.640
 I typically like to play one or two,

1:08:03.640 --> 1:08:05.120
 but I can play up to four.

1:08:05.120 --> 1:08:09.360
 I find that past four, it's hard for me to keep up

1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:11.360
 and keep track of what's actually happening.

1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:13.240
 You know, it's a different mindset required.

1:08:13.240 --> 1:08:14.240
 Like a lot of these young guys,

1:08:14.240 --> 1:08:16.720
 they're accustomed to 20 tables at a time.

1:08:17.720 --> 1:08:20.680
 It feels like the purity of the game is gone.

1:08:20.680 --> 1:08:22.000
 It's much more robotic, right?

1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:23.800
 So if you're playing 20 tables,

1:08:23.800 --> 1:08:27.040
 you're just making decisions based on like what, you know,

1:08:27.040 --> 1:08:30.280
 you're not thinking about the depth of the situation

1:08:30.280 --> 1:08:31.640
 and what just happened 15 minutes ago.

1:08:31.640 --> 1:08:32.600
 You don't even know what happened

1:08:32.600 --> 1:08:35.360
 because you can't pay attention to all that at once.

1:08:35.360 --> 1:08:37.560
 And some of the magic of poker is the low sample.

1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:38.400
 I agree.

1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:41.240
 For example, and sorry to be bringing up Magnus so much,

1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:42.960
 but there's so much parallel between the two of you

1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:45.640
 and the poker and the chess world.

1:08:45.640 --> 1:08:49.160
 He hates Olympics and world championships

1:08:49.160 --> 1:08:51.760
 and all that kind of stuff because it's so low sample.

1:08:51.760 --> 1:08:53.440
 But to me, that's part of the magic of it.

1:08:53.440 --> 1:08:56.880
 There's the World Series of Poker, the main event.

1:08:56.880 --> 1:08:58.440
 There's a magic to it.

1:08:58.440 --> 1:08:59.320
 I agree, yeah.

1:08:59.320 --> 1:09:00.920
 And I don't know what that is exactly

1:09:00.920 --> 1:09:03.760
 because so much of the stake is so rare,

1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:07.840
 so much drama and heartbreak leading up to it

1:09:07.840 --> 1:09:12.160
 that all somehow, yeah, it accumulates

1:09:12.160 --> 1:09:15.360
 to that magical moment when somebody wins.

1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:16.400
 Especially that event,

1:09:16.400 --> 1:09:18.280
 the World Series of Poker main event historically,

1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:20.040
 like that's it, you know, that's the pinnacle.

1:09:20.040 --> 1:09:21.520
 That's where like mainstream watches,

1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:23.240
 that's where people are tuning in

1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:25.440
 and the gravity of the moment, you know,

1:09:25.440 --> 1:09:26.640
 it's so much bigger than people,

1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:28.320
 like everyone gets the opportunity

1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:30.400
 to play armchair quarterback too, right?

1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:31.440
 Oh, he should do this.

1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:32.520
 You're not there.

1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:33.560
 You're not under the lights.

1:09:33.560 --> 1:09:34.920
 You're not under the pressure.

1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:37.400
 You know, it might seem easy for you at home to be like,

1:09:37.400 --> 1:09:39.320
 well, yeah, but you can see the whole cards.

1:09:39.320 --> 1:09:40.440
 You know, they can't.

1:09:40.440 --> 1:09:44.160
 Certainly the idea of the small sample with tournaments,

1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:49.160
 I like the idea that you don't have to worry about,

1:09:49.400 --> 1:09:52.920
 oh, well, if I do this now, then in the future,

1:09:52.920 --> 1:09:53.960
 you know, I won't be balanced.

1:09:53.960 --> 1:09:55.640
 I have to be balanced here or anything like that.

1:09:55.640 --> 1:09:57.960
 That's like really boring and lame, right?

1:09:57.960 --> 1:10:00.720
 Again, that is kind of the way the younger generation

1:10:00.720 --> 1:10:03.600
 learns how to play the game, being balanced in every spot

1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:07.960
 and then randomizing, you know, like, oh,

1:10:07.960 --> 1:10:09.240
 I'm supposed to do this 50% of the time.

1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:12.360
 Okay, so if my left card is red, I'll do it.

1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:13.240
 And if it's black, I don't.

1:10:13.240 --> 1:10:14.400
 So you're not even making,

1:10:14.400 --> 1:10:17.000
 you're no longer making actual decisions for yourself.

1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:18.440
 You're just randomizing.

1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:20.720
 And that's way less fun for me

1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:23.200
 than tailoring it to the situation.

1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:24.720
 And the final table at the main event,

1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:25.560
 there's none of that.

1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:28.240
 You have to, I mean, it's all or nothing.

1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:30.520
 Well, you shouldn't be, but there are like, again,

1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:31.560
 I think a lot of the young guys,

1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:32.880
 they are thinking in that regard,

1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:34.800
 like, oh, randomization.

1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:38.000
 Maybe at that table, the final table at the main event,

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:39.720
 what's a hand that stands out to you

1:10:39.720 --> 1:10:44.080
 that was especially gutsy and powerful or memorable

1:10:44.080 --> 1:10:46.080
 for that you've seen in the history of poker?

1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:47.520
 Well, for me, the one that stands out

1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:49.600
 and probably because I was so young

1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:51.800
 and it was my first year, like one of my wife,

1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:53.240
 won a bracelet that year,

1:10:53.240 --> 1:10:56.400
 was I was friends with Scotty Wynn, the Prince of Poker.

1:10:56.400 --> 1:10:58.960
 And he was heads up against the guy named Kevin McBride.

1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:00.880
 And I was on the rail, you know, I'm like, wow,

1:11:00.880 --> 1:11:02.280
 he's gonna, you know, he's heads up.

1:11:02.280 --> 1:11:03.480
 And he was so cool.

1:11:03.480 --> 1:11:05.960
 Like he had a mullet, but it's perfect, right?

1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:07.640
 He had the white shirt, the black thing.

1:11:07.640 --> 1:11:10.520
 He's drinking a Michelob, smoking a cigarette, whatever,

1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:12.120
 you know, all chill.

1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:13.800
 He bets it all on the river.

1:11:13.800 --> 1:11:17.760
 And the guy's thinking, and he psychologically owned him.

1:11:17.760 --> 1:11:20.160
 And he said, he goes with his beer, he goes,

1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:21.760
 you call gonna be all over baby.

1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:23.560
 Ha ha ha, that's right.

1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:27.120
 Okay, so this guy who was an amateur heard that

1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:29.120
 and was like, there's so much pressure

1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:30.240
 in this moment right now.

1:11:30.240 --> 1:11:31.840
 I can't handle this pressure.

1:11:31.840 --> 1:11:33.920
 But Scotty just told me, if I call here,

1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:34.920
 the pressure's gone.

1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:36.200
 I don't have to be under it anymore.

1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:39.760
 So he sort of hypnotized them into making the call,

1:11:39.760 --> 1:11:41.440
 you know, and Scotty had it.

1:11:41.440 --> 1:11:43.240
 Scotty had, you know, the full house

1:11:43.240 --> 1:11:44.200
 and it was over for the guy.

1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:45.960
 You call gonna be all over baby.

1:11:45.960 --> 1:11:47.880
 It was, I just, I love that aspect,

1:11:47.880 --> 1:11:49.320
 sort of the table talk dynamic,

1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:52.780
 which isn't as prevalent today as it was back then,

1:11:54.160 --> 1:11:55.200
 but that one sticks out.

1:11:55.200 --> 1:11:57.120
 And it probably, because it was one of my first.

1:11:57.120 --> 1:12:02.120
 So the few words you say at the table can completely affect

1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.120
 a hand like that.

1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:07.660
 That's almost, that's scary.

1:12:07.660 --> 1:12:09.720
 It was just so cool to me, you know,

1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:11.900
 like just how he was so calm.

1:12:11.900 --> 1:12:14.920
 And I think that too, added more pressure to the amateur.

1:12:14.920 --> 1:12:17.540
 And I think like, again, part of it is,

1:12:17.540 --> 1:12:19.400
 even back then it was 1998,

1:12:19.400 --> 1:12:21.640
 there's still a big rail of people and there's lights

1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:22.920
 and they're, you know, they're filming

1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:23.760
 and all this kind of stuff.

1:12:23.760 --> 1:12:25.280
 And it's a lot of pressure for a guy

1:12:25.280 --> 1:12:26.560
 who's never been in this environment.

1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:31.080
 And now I'm telling you, it can all be over soon.

1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:33.560
 It will all be over soon.

1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:35.700
 Just call, it's finished.

1:12:36.840 --> 1:12:39.160
 Something about that accent too.

1:12:39.160 --> 1:12:41.640
 Now you're a master at table talk as well.

1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:45.240
 Do you have, do you just kind of go with your gut,

1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:46.200
 you flow with it?

1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:49.240
 Or is there a deliberate strategy with this sometimes?

1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:51.760
 There's usually some sort of strategy that I think about

1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:53.380
 in terms of what I want to say and whatnot.

1:12:53.380 --> 1:12:56.520
 But a lot of the time I just go, I go with it, you know,

1:12:56.520 --> 1:12:59.160
 the more you talk, the more information you get.

1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:02.000
 Yeah, but in some cases against really good players,

1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:04.280
 you're just giving away information, right?

1:13:04.280 --> 1:13:05.600
 Like if I'm playing against Phil Ivey,

1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:08.020
 I'm not engaging in anything.

1:13:08.020 --> 1:13:08.960
 Cause he can read through it.

1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:11.480
 He can sense based on what I'm saying, you know,

1:13:11.480 --> 1:13:13.640
 the clues and where I'm trying to take him.

1:13:13.640 --> 1:13:16.540
 And he reads through, he sees the tree through the forest

1:13:16.540 --> 1:13:17.620
 or whatever you want to call it,

1:13:17.620 --> 1:13:18.980
 the forest through the trees.

1:13:18.980 --> 1:13:21.920
 And you know, so then I would just be like

1:13:23.080 --> 1:13:24.480
 allowing myself to be exploitable.

1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:26.640
 Is some of it just for fun?

1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:29.400
 Because at the end of the day, if you're having fun,

1:13:29.400 --> 1:13:31.280
 you might be at the top of your game.

1:13:31.280 --> 1:13:33.320
 I've been thinking about this a lot lately actually.

1:13:33.320 --> 1:13:34.500
 It's funny you bring this up

1:13:34.500 --> 1:13:36.960
 because I've been thinking about when I'm at my best.

1:13:36.960 --> 1:13:39.500
 And I think I'm at my best when I am comfortable like that.

1:13:39.500 --> 1:13:40.340
 Right?

1:13:40.340 --> 1:13:42.960
 Where I'm not so stiff and worried about, you know,

1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:44.920
 checking properly and worried about reading people.

1:13:44.920 --> 1:13:46.440
 I'm like, no, I'm me.

1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:47.280
 All right, I'm going to play some poker.

1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:48.120
 What do you want?

1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:48.940
 Do you want to call me?

1:13:48.940 --> 1:13:49.780
 Call, go ahead, do what you want.

1:13:49.780 --> 1:13:50.600
 Right?

1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:51.640
 Cause then I realized, you know, ultimately it was like,

1:13:51.640 --> 1:13:53.080
 I'm comfortable in that.

1:13:53.080 --> 1:13:54.600
 My opponents aren't as comfortable in that.

1:13:54.600 --> 1:13:57.240
 They're comfortable with this, you know, the robot thing.

1:13:57.240 --> 1:13:59.960
 But I thought more about that and how,

1:13:59.960 --> 1:14:01.920
 especially with some tournaments coming up,

1:14:01.920 --> 1:14:05.400
 I plan on really kind of sort of getting back to my roots

1:14:05.400 --> 1:14:06.240
 in that regard.

1:14:07.640 --> 1:14:08.480
 I love it.

1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:10.040
 From a spectator perspective, I love it.

1:14:10.040 --> 1:14:11.880
 But it's also interesting whenever you see a Daniel

1:14:11.880 --> 1:14:13.000
 on the ground of quiet.

1:14:15.080 --> 1:14:19.360
 That's an interesting, like it feels like a calm

1:14:19.360 --> 1:14:20.880
 before a storm of sorts.

1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:22.440
 So I'm sure that's also part of it.

1:14:22.440 --> 1:14:24.160
 Yeah, like I've gone, I've ebbed and flowed.

1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:25.960
 And like I said, you know, I took on some coaches

1:14:25.960 --> 1:14:27.360
 and that was really learning game theory.

1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:29.600
 Cause I felt like it was important to always stick,

1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:31.160
 you know, keep up with what's going on.

1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:33.480
 And then I do feel like to some degree,

1:14:33.480 --> 1:14:36.360
 it sort of took away a little bit of my own

1:14:37.760 --> 1:14:39.840
 instinctual ideas in terms of what I should be doing.

1:14:39.840 --> 1:14:40.680
 Right?

1:14:40.680 --> 1:14:43.840
 So I think like the most dangerous version of myself

1:14:43.840 --> 1:14:46.820
 is a deep understanding of the game theory

1:14:46.820 --> 1:14:50.040
 with my wisdom of many years of,

1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:53.240
 and comfort of just sort of like being myself at the table.

1:14:53.240 --> 1:14:54.440
 And being relaxed.

1:14:54.440 --> 1:14:55.280
 Relaxed.

1:14:55.280 --> 1:14:56.600
 Letting your mind flow.

1:14:56.600 --> 1:14:59.280
 Let me ask you the greatest, the goat question,

1:14:59.280 --> 1:15:00.280
 greatest of all time.

1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:03.320
 Can you make the case for a few folks?

1:15:03.320 --> 1:15:07.480
 So first you tweeted referring to Phil Ivey as the goat,

1:15:07.480 --> 1:15:09.320
 saying the goat doing goat things.

1:15:09.320 --> 1:15:10.720
 That's a recent tweet.

1:15:10.720 --> 1:15:14.240
 So can you make the case for Phil Ivey,

1:15:14.240 --> 1:15:17.560
 or maybe who is the greatest poker player of all time?

1:15:17.560 --> 1:15:19.040
 Would you put Phil?

1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:21.880
 For me, until someone knocks him off the podium,

1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:24.680
 the king of poker and the goat is Phil Ivey.

1:15:24.680 --> 1:15:25.520
 Okay?

1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:26.340
 So, and the reason I say that is,

1:15:26.340 --> 1:15:28.240
 I think of poker as more than just one game.

1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:29.080
 Right?

1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:29.920
 There's different variants.

1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:32.480
 You know, there's Holdem, Omaha, Stud, Triple Draw,

1:15:32.480 --> 1:15:33.960
 all these different types of games.

1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:37.920
 And Phil in every arena has been dominant.

1:15:37.920 --> 1:15:40.560
 Whether it was tournament poker, dominated it.

1:15:40.560 --> 1:15:43.680
 Mixed game, high stakes poker in Bobby's room, dominated.

1:15:43.680 --> 1:15:46.900
 Online poker against all the wizards, dominated.

1:15:46.900 --> 1:15:48.600
 Made millions in every arena.

1:15:48.600 --> 1:15:51.200
 And, you know, he sort of took a few years away from poker

1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:52.720
 with his legal troubles and things like that,

1:15:52.720 --> 1:15:53.680
 but he's back.

1:15:53.680 --> 1:15:56.280
 You know, he's been playing in the high roller series again.

1:15:56.280 --> 1:15:58.160
 And, you know, he comes from,

1:15:58.160 --> 1:15:59.860
 he's cut from a different cloth,

1:15:59.860 --> 1:16:03.700
 but he has a tenacity and a focus that's unparalleled,

1:16:03.700 --> 1:16:04.540
 I think.

1:16:04.540 --> 1:16:06.480
 When he's in the zone, I mean, for lack,

1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:08.080
 and this has nothing to do with race.

1:16:08.080 --> 1:16:09.560
 It really has to do with mannerism,

1:16:09.560 --> 1:16:12.320
 but he does remind me of like a combination

1:16:12.320 --> 1:16:14.000
 of Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods

1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:15.080
 in the way that he approaches it.

1:16:15.080 --> 1:16:16.720
 He's very intense.

1:16:16.720 --> 1:16:19.040
 And he outworks everybody, you know?

1:16:19.040 --> 1:16:20.400
 And I think, frankly,

1:16:20.400 --> 1:16:22.580
 a lot of his mannerisms do come from them

1:16:22.580 --> 1:16:25.000
 because he's young watching these guys on TV.

1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:27.280
 And a lot of his ways of being, you know,

1:16:27.280 --> 1:16:29.400
 his learned behavior, I think probably from people like that.

1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:31.320
 People at the top of their sport

1:16:31.320 --> 1:16:34.400
 and people that are Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan

1:16:34.400 --> 1:16:35.720
 aren't just at the top of their sport,

1:16:35.720 --> 1:16:37.160
 but they kind of dominate the sport

1:16:37.160 --> 1:16:38.440
 to some kind of aura that.

1:16:38.440 --> 1:16:39.720
 There's a uniqueness to them.

1:16:39.720 --> 1:16:41.440
 They're not built like us.

1:16:41.440 --> 1:16:42.760
 They're not, you know, they're not.

1:16:42.760 --> 1:16:45.200
 Like I wish, I wish I could have the kind of focus

1:16:45.200 --> 1:16:47.120
 that Phil Ivey has, you know, and see everything

1:16:47.120 --> 1:16:47.960
 that he's saying.

1:16:47.960 --> 1:16:49.520
 I just, that's not me, you know?

1:16:49.520 --> 1:16:50.400
 I don't have that.

1:16:50.400 --> 1:16:53.400
 And he does, he has that gene, whatever it is.

1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:55.700
 But they also look like they're not having that much fun.

1:16:55.700 --> 1:16:58.180
 They're more focused on the perfection,

1:16:58.180 --> 1:17:00.080
 like a dogged pursuit of perfection.

1:17:00.080 --> 1:17:01.880
 And you know, that might even be true.

1:17:01.880 --> 1:17:03.080
 It might not be as fun.

1:17:03.080 --> 1:17:03.920
 You know, I don't know.

1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:05.080
 Like I have fun at the table.

1:17:05.080 --> 1:17:07.200
 When you look outwardly, you look at someone,

1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:08.560
 like maybe he is having a blast.

1:17:08.560 --> 1:17:11.080
 Maybe that's just the way that he likes, you know?

1:17:11.080 --> 1:17:13.880
 Like is Tiger Woods having fun when he's like on 17

1:17:13.880 --> 1:17:14.720
 about to win a major?

1:17:14.720 --> 1:17:16.920
 It doesn't look like it, theoretically.

1:17:16.920 --> 1:17:19.240
 Well, if you look at Michael Jordan,

1:17:19.240 --> 1:17:20.320
 I don't know about Tiger Woods,

1:17:20.320 --> 1:17:22.760
 but I think they're more focused

1:17:22.760 --> 1:17:25.000
 on every single mistake they make.

1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:27.920
 I think they're more obsessed about not making a mistake

1:17:27.920 --> 1:17:30.480
 and hating every time they make a mistake.

1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:34.760
 That's probably like 99% of their mental energy.

1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:37.400
 I think that's part of what makes them great, right?

1:17:37.400 --> 1:17:39.160
 They don't look past the mistake and just let it,

1:17:39.160 --> 1:17:40.000
 it's whatever.

1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:41.800
 They're like, they want to correct it.

1:17:41.800 --> 1:17:44.540
 And yeah, there's a tension, almost like a trade off.

1:17:44.540 --> 1:17:45.840
 I wonder if that's always the case

1:17:45.840 --> 1:17:49.200
 between sort of greatness and happiness.

1:17:49.200 --> 1:17:51.680
 I remember Huck Seed, who, you know,

1:17:51.680 --> 1:17:53.960
 when I was a kid growing up, he was like the poker idol.

1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:55.920
 He won the world championship in 1996.

1:17:55.920 --> 1:17:57.960
 And I was lucky enough to hang out with him a little bit.

1:17:57.960 --> 1:17:59.160
 And he would go through these streaks

1:17:59.160 --> 1:18:02.480
 where he had an A game and he had an F game.

1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:03.720
 His A game was unparalleled.

1:18:03.720 --> 1:18:05.080
 Nobody could beat him, right?

1:18:05.080 --> 1:18:09.040
 But his F game was so terrible that he was just a fish.

1:18:09.040 --> 1:18:10.240
 You know, he was playing terribly.

1:18:10.240 --> 1:18:11.280
 And I remember him saying,

1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:13.320
 and it was exactly what you're saying.

1:18:13.320 --> 1:18:16.240
 He'd make like one little mistake, right?

1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:17.720
 And then he would go off.

1:18:17.720 --> 1:18:19.320
 And I was like, Huck, why do you do that?

1:18:19.320 --> 1:18:20.720
 Like, you know, your B game would be just fine.

1:18:20.720 --> 1:18:21.880
 He's like, well, if I'm gonna make a mistake,

1:18:21.880 --> 1:18:22.720
 what's the point?

1:18:23.580 --> 1:18:25.000
 What's the point, right?

1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:26.000
 I'm trying.

1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:27.320
 Like, if you can't play perfect,

1:18:27.320 --> 1:18:28.840
 there's no point in playing at all.

1:18:28.840 --> 1:18:30.720
 So he was extreme in that regard,

1:18:30.720 --> 1:18:32.040
 in the way that he viewed it.

1:18:32.040 --> 1:18:33.760
 And depending on the sport,

1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:36.400
 those folks, like in chess, certainly the case,

1:18:36.400 --> 1:18:38.520
 that kind of mindset can destroy you.

1:18:38.520 --> 1:18:39.360
 Absolutely.

1:18:39.360 --> 1:18:40.200
 No, I totally see that.

1:18:40.200 --> 1:18:42.760
 Because of a sequence of mistakes.

1:18:42.760 --> 1:18:44.680
 Like the kind of year you had

1:18:44.680 --> 1:18:45.760
 with the well scissor poker

1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:48.400
 can completely destroy a human being.

1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:51.080
 If you're not able to see the bigger picture of it.

1:18:51.080 --> 1:18:52.200
 Yeah.

1:18:52.200 --> 1:18:55.280
 You said that Phil Ivey is the hardest,

1:18:55.280 --> 1:18:56.360
 your toughest opponent,

1:18:56.360 --> 1:18:57.800
 the toughest person to play against.

1:18:57.800 --> 1:18:59.000
 Why is that?

1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:00.720
 And how do you beat him?

1:19:00.720 --> 1:19:02.240
 Because Phil Ivey's just,

1:19:02.240 --> 1:19:04.840
 he's seeing things that nobody else has seen really.

1:19:04.840 --> 1:19:06.780
 Like subtle things, where I'm putting my hands,

1:19:06.780 --> 1:19:08.760
 where I'm looking, you know, my pulse,

1:19:08.760 --> 1:19:10.680
 like stuff that I don't even know I'm giving off.

1:19:10.680 --> 1:19:13.000
 He's so engaged and so focused

1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:17.600
 and has such a, just a, he's fearless, right?

1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:18.560
 A lot of people, you know,

1:19:18.560 --> 1:19:19.400
 they'll play poker and be like,

1:19:19.400 --> 1:19:20.220
 you know what?

1:19:20.220 --> 1:19:21.060
 I don't think this guy has it.

1:19:21.060 --> 1:19:22.480
 But do they have the guts?

1:19:22.480 --> 1:19:24.360
 Do they have the cojones, if you will,

1:19:24.360 --> 1:19:26.320
 to actually do anything about it?

1:19:26.320 --> 1:19:27.160
 Right?

1:19:27.160 --> 1:19:27.980
 And stand up to this person?

1:19:27.980 --> 1:19:28.820
 He does.

1:19:28.820 --> 1:19:29.660
 You know?

1:19:29.660 --> 1:19:30.840
 I forgot the hand that you tweeted

1:19:30.840 --> 1:19:33.200
 about the goat doing goat things.

1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:34.960
 That wasn't even that big of a goat hand.

1:19:34.960 --> 1:19:37.280
 But like, there's hands where like,

1:19:37.280 --> 1:19:39.980
 there was a famous one in Australia

1:19:39.980 --> 1:19:43.240
 where the flop was like jack, jack at nine

1:19:43.240 --> 1:19:46.640
 and Phil check raised the flop with six, seven, nothing.

1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:47.840
 Just absolutely nothing.

1:19:47.840 --> 1:19:50.440
 And the guy re raised him, right?

1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:52.080
 And Phil just knew.

1:19:52.080 --> 1:19:53.800
 He went all in with nothing.

1:19:53.800 --> 1:19:55.600
 If the guy calls, he's done, he's cooked.

1:19:55.600 --> 1:19:59.240
 But he was so tuned in that this guy's not strong,

1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:01.220
 that he just, you know, he did things like that.

1:20:01.220 --> 1:20:03.400
 And it's tough to play against a guy like that.

1:20:03.400 --> 1:20:07.680
 So he gets great reads and is able to execute on them,

1:20:07.680 --> 1:20:09.960
 has the guts to execute on them.

1:20:09.960 --> 1:20:12.640
 He's got experience, he's got work ethic.

1:20:12.640 --> 1:20:16.180
 He also, I think one thing I'm underselling too,

1:20:16.180 --> 1:20:18.240
 is his strategic mind, right?

1:20:18.240 --> 1:20:21.800
 Like I believe that, you know, like I said,

1:20:21.800 --> 1:20:23.460
 the new age player, they learn how to play

1:20:23.460 --> 1:20:25.240
 through a very systematic approach.

1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:27.040
 Okay, let's look at the data.

1:20:27.040 --> 1:20:29.080
 Make up a game right now.

1:20:29.080 --> 1:20:31.100
 Three cards, we each get three cards.

1:20:31.100 --> 1:20:34.040
 Jacks are wild, sixes are, you know,

1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:35.600
 six of hearts is wild, right?

1:20:35.600 --> 1:20:36.840
 Just make up that game.

1:20:36.840 --> 1:20:39.320
 Phil will figure it out intuitively,

1:20:39.320 --> 1:20:41.100
 very, very quickly, right?

1:20:41.100 --> 1:20:43.760
 Without having the answers for him, right?

1:20:43.760 --> 1:20:45.000
 So that's like the difference

1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:46.740
 between the players of my generation.

1:20:46.740 --> 1:20:48.880
 We had to figure this stuff out on our own.

1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:50.880
 Today, well, I wanna know the answer,

1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:53.240
 I go ask the computer and the computer tells me.

1:20:53.240 --> 1:20:55.720
 So I really believe like if you created a game from scratch

1:20:55.720 --> 1:20:59.140
 that Phil Ivey would be my horse that I wanna play in it.

1:20:59.140 --> 1:21:03.520
 So he's in some sense in tune with some deeper thing.

1:21:03.520 --> 1:21:06.200
 He has what we used to call card sense.

1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:07.720
 Card sense.

1:21:07.720 --> 1:21:09.880
 Can you try to make the case for some others

1:21:09.880 --> 1:21:13.960
 like Doyle Brunson, Phil Hellmuth, Daniel Negrano,

1:21:13.960 --> 1:21:15.760
 and maybe one of the modern guys

1:21:15.760 --> 1:21:17.240
 like Justin Bonomo or somebody like that?

1:21:17.240 --> 1:21:20.000
 Sure, oh, so let's start with Doyle, okay?

1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:22.040
 Like what Doyle has going for him above all,

1:21:22.040 --> 1:21:24.240
 above and beyond is twofold, really.

1:21:24.240 --> 1:21:26.760
 Longevity, I mean, he's in his late 80s.

1:21:26.760 --> 1:21:29.240
 And last time I played with him, I was like,

1:21:29.240 --> 1:21:30.480
 how is he getting better?

1:21:30.480 --> 1:21:32.080
 Like I really felt like he was playing better

1:21:32.080 --> 1:21:34.640
 than he had, you know, in the previous years.

1:21:34.640 --> 1:21:38.040
 But also with Doyle, like Doyle had to figure,

1:21:38.040 --> 1:21:39.880
 you know, we talked about my generation

1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:40.920
 having to figure it on their own.

1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:43.040
 I mean, they really had to figure it out on their own.

1:21:43.040 --> 1:21:45.200
 Like they didn't have any computer simulation

1:21:45.200 --> 1:21:47.720
 to tell you if Ace King was a favorite over pocket sixes.

1:21:47.720 --> 1:21:48.560
 They didn't.

1:21:48.560 --> 1:21:49.380
 So we know what he did.

1:21:49.380 --> 1:21:51.640
 He would take a deck of cards and they would deal out,

1:21:51.640 --> 1:21:53.060
 and they were with a notepad, right?

1:21:53.060 --> 1:21:54.360
 Okay, Ace King won.

1:21:54.360 --> 1:21:55.640
 And then they would do like a hundred of them

1:21:55.640 --> 1:21:57.680
 and be like, all right, Ace King won like 53.

1:21:57.680 --> 1:21:58.720
 So it must be a favorite.

1:21:58.720 --> 1:22:00.720
 And he did it manually, you know?

1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:03.200
 And he did it in a time when it was very, very difficult.

1:22:03.200 --> 1:22:06.140
 And he's seen poker evolve and change throughout the years.

1:22:06.140 --> 1:22:08.240
 Now, listen, is he gonna be able to compete

1:22:08.240 --> 1:22:09.400
 against the top players in the world today?

1:22:09.400 --> 1:22:10.960
 Absolutely not, you know?

1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:14.680
 But how many people, he's the best 88 year old player

1:22:14.680 --> 1:22:16.400
 in the world by a mile, okay?

1:22:16.400 --> 1:22:17.640
 That's not even close.

1:22:17.640 --> 1:22:20.120
 And Doyle, again, he's another guy who plays all the games.

1:22:20.120 --> 1:22:22.840
 He's played high stakes cash, tournaments, you name it.

1:22:22.840 --> 1:22:24.520
 He's iconic, you know, he's the godfather.

1:22:24.520 --> 1:22:26.440
 So, but there's also an element to that.

1:22:26.440 --> 1:22:30.500
 So the iconic element, like your personality in poker.

1:22:30.500 --> 1:22:33.360
 I mean, not to romanticize this thing too much,

1:22:33.360 --> 1:22:38.220
 but poker is also a game of personalities.

1:22:38.220 --> 1:22:39.920
 I mean, it's part of the greatness

1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:43.040
 is like the uniqueness of the human being.

1:22:43.040 --> 1:22:44.200
 Yeah, I think also, yeah.

1:22:44.200 --> 1:22:46.080
 I mean, if you'd like looking at it from that perspective

1:22:46.080 --> 1:22:47.320
 in terms of like Goat,

1:22:47.320 --> 1:22:49.320
 like Goat in terms of what you represent,

1:22:49.320 --> 1:22:51.400
 like the cowboy, the godfather, you know,

1:22:51.400 --> 1:22:52.320
 he's been around, you know,

1:22:52.320 --> 1:22:54.560
 we played in the sixties and stuff like that.

1:22:54.560 --> 1:22:56.400
 It's just something like incredibly cool.

1:22:56.400 --> 1:22:59.360
 Like I often think about if I could go back in time

1:22:59.360 --> 1:23:01.280
 and like visit, you know, an era,

1:23:01.280 --> 1:23:04.200
 I'd love to go like to Vegas in the seventies

1:23:04.200 --> 1:23:05.280
 and just like, I'm proud.

1:23:05.280 --> 1:23:07.080
 I already, like, I can think of what it would smell like,

1:23:07.080 --> 1:23:09.240
 probably not ideal, cigarettes and, you know,

1:23:09.240 --> 1:23:11.300
 the leather jackets and just the vibe

1:23:11.300 --> 1:23:13.200
 of what it must've been like with the mobsters

1:23:13.200 --> 1:23:14.040
 and things like that.

1:23:14.040 --> 1:23:15.160
 You know, he's lived through all that,

1:23:15.160 --> 1:23:16.380
 all the cool movies we've seen.

1:23:16.380 --> 1:23:18.600
 Like Doyle talks about some of those films.

1:23:18.600 --> 1:23:20.200
 He's like, yeah, that guy,

1:23:20.200 --> 1:23:22.120
 he said he was gonna stab me in my stomach.

1:23:22.120 --> 1:23:23.880
 You know, he knows these people.

1:23:23.880 --> 1:23:27.280
 It was, he's like a source of history, really.

1:23:27.280 --> 1:23:31.720
 Yeah, when poker was a game for the mob

1:23:31.720 --> 1:23:34.480
 and the degenerates and all that kind of stuff

1:23:34.480 --> 1:23:37.380
 before it transitioned into professional sport.

1:23:37.380 --> 1:23:38.220
 Yeah.

1:23:38.220 --> 1:23:39.060
 Professional game.

1:23:39.060 --> 1:23:40.680
 Yeah, so he was there through the whole thing.

1:23:40.680 --> 1:23:42.840
 He's been there through the whole transition.

1:23:42.840 --> 1:23:43.760
 He's seen it all, yeah.

1:23:43.760 --> 1:23:45.120
 Yeah, and then to the online world.

1:23:45.120 --> 1:23:46.800
 So what about,

1:23:49.920 --> 1:23:51.760
 I can't even say without smiling, Phil Hellmuth.

1:23:51.760 --> 1:23:53.720
 Okay, so Phil, here's the thing with Phil.

1:23:53.720 --> 1:23:56.480
 He takes it very personal when I say this

1:23:56.480 --> 1:23:58.040
 and he doesn't hear the compliment.

1:23:58.040 --> 1:23:59.560
 He only hears the negativity.

1:23:59.560 --> 1:24:00.720
 Because Phil wants to be considered

1:24:00.720 --> 1:24:01.560
 the greatest of all time.

1:24:01.560 --> 1:24:02.520
 Hashtag positive.

1:24:02.520 --> 1:24:04.360
 He wants to be the greatest of all time.

1:24:04.360 --> 1:24:07.040
 But I'm like, Phil, here's the facts.

1:24:07.040 --> 1:24:10.120
 You have the best, absolute greatest resume

1:24:10.120 --> 1:24:12.320
 at the World Series of Poker of anyone in the world.

1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:13.960
 Is that not enough, right?

1:24:13.960 --> 1:24:14.860
 That's what you have.

1:24:14.860 --> 1:24:16.200
 You have that, right?

1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:17.680
 Now, do I think you're the best

1:24:17.680 --> 1:24:19.320
 no limit holding player in the world today?

1:24:19.320 --> 1:24:20.160
 No.

1:24:20.160 --> 1:24:21.240
 Do I think that, you know,

1:24:21.240 --> 1:24:22.800
 you can play high stakes mixed games

1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:24.400
 with the best players in the world today and win?

1:24:24.400 --> 1:24:25.320
 No, right?

1:24:25.320 --> 1:24:28.360
 So he wouldn't get as much flack on this topic

1:24:28.360 --> 1:24:31.480
 if he wasn't so boastful and like, you know, demanding.

1:24:31.480 --> 1:24:32.700
 Like you never hear Phil Ivey say,

1:24:32.700 --> 1:24:33.920
 I'm the best in the world.

1:24:33.920 --> 1:24:35.740
 Like his peers do, right?

1:24:35.740 --> 1:24:37.140
 But Phil wants to make the claim.

1:24:37.140 --> 1:24:40.760
 And I simply say, I beg to differ, right?

1:24:40.760 --> 1:24:41.680
 I beg to differ.

1:24:41.680 --> 1:24:45.480
 Like, I don't think you are the best player in the world.

1:24:45.480 --> 1:24:48.320
 If we can linger on the compliment so he can hear it,

1:24:49.220 --> 1:24:50.440
 what makes him so good?

1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:52.800
 Because it seems like a lot of times

1:24:52.800 --> 1:24:54.680
 his play is not optimal.

1:24:54.680 --> 1:24:57.880
 Yeah, he definitely has his own brand and style of play,

1:24:57.880 --> 1:24:58.720
 right?

1:24:58.720 --> 1:24:59.540
 He does not adhere to,

1:24:59.540 --> 1:25:00.760
 he's never used a solver in his life.

1:25:00.760 --> 1:25:03.160
 He doesn't know, he's not in that world, right?

1:25:03.160 --> 1:25:05.520
 Phil has a lot of faith and a lot of confidence

1:25:05.520 --> 1:25:07.520
 in what he does and that it will be successful.

1:25:07.520 --> 1:25:09.840
 And I think there's something to be said about that, right?

1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:13.640
 He doesn't ever lack in belief that he can win

1:25:13.640 --> 1:25:15.880
 and he finds a way to do it his way.

1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:18.120
 And frankly, a lot of what he does

1:25:18.120 --> 1:25:21.600
 is very effective against specific types of players

1:25:21.600 --> 1:25:23.680
 who are intimidated by him,

1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:25.560
 but whether it's his resume or his demeanor

1:25:25.560 --> 1:25:27.280
 or his attitude sometimes, right?

1:25:27.280 --> 1:25:28.720
 Like if you're an average player

1:25:28.720 --> 1:25:31.800
 and then you beat Phil in a hand, you're gonna hear it.

1:25:31.800 --> 1:25:34.960
 This idiot from Northern Europe and beat me in this pot.

1:25:34.960 --> 1:25:37.160
 And for some people, they don't like that.

1:25:37.160 --> 1:25:39.800
 So he can use that against them.

1:25:39.800 --> 1:25:44.800
 But I also think too, like he cares so much, right?

1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:48.440
 And that leads to trying really, really hard.

1:25:48.440 --> 1:25:50.880
 Like he sees these moments and he doesn't phone them in.

1:25:50.880 --> 1:25:53.440
 Like whatever brand of poker he plays,

1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:57.280
 he tries his best at all times to succeed and to win.

1:25:57.280 --> 1:26:00.080
 And there's some, even though like he's fundamentally flawed

1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:01.040
 in a lot of things that he does

1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:02.840
 compared to some of the bigger players,

1:26:02.840 --> 1:26:05.160
 his effort and will and like his determination

1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:08.480
 to stick around is, you know, is up there.

1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:12.240
 And he is somebody who seems to really hate losing.

1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:17.240
 Yes, yeah, he feels like he deserves to win, right?

1:26:17.840 --> 1:26:18.680
 In all cases.

1:26:18.680 --> 1:26:22.000
 And if he loses, it's, you know, it's not just.

1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:23.840
 As you joked around that you and him

1:26:23.840 --> 1:26:26.040
 might do an anger management course.

1:26:26.040 --> 1:26:30.680
 Yeah, I did say that in one video.

1:26:30.680 --> 1:26:33.640
 Now this is tough because you're a humble guy,

1:26:33.640 --> 1:26:35.400
 but objectively speaking,

1:26:35.400 --> 1:26:37.880
 can you say what your strengths are?

1:26:37.880 --> 1:26:39.760
 You're often listed as one of,

1:26:39.760 --> 1:26:41.360
 if not the greatest player of all time.

1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:44.080
 So what are the things that make you stand out?

1:26:44.080 --> 1:26:46.320
 So for me, when I grew up,

1:26:46.320 --> 1:26:48.240
 I admired the big cash game players,

1:26:48.240 --> 1:26:49.080
 because that's what I was.

1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:51.280
 I love tournaments, but I wanted to be well rounded.

1:26:51.280 --> 1:26:53.760
 Like in my day, you couldn't make the poker hall of fame

1:26:53.760 --> 1:26:55.240
 if you just played one game.

1:26:55.240 --> 1:26:57.720
 You had to jump in to the high stakes games

1:26:57.720 --> 1:26:59.800
 in Bobby's room, as they say, right?

1:26:59.800 --> 1:27:00.880
 And I was able to do that.

1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:03.600
 When I was in my early, in my mid twenties,

1:27:03.600 --> 1:27:06.000
 I was playing 4,000, 8,000 limits.

1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.080
 You know, you could win or lose a million dollars in a day.

1:27:08.080 --> 1:27:09.200
 So I grinded it out.

1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:11.160
 Like a lot of people think, oh, you know, he's lucky.

1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:12.520
 He's had sponsorship.

1:27:12.520 --> 1:27:13.360
 Otherwise he'd be broke.

1:27:13.360 --> 1:27:16.440
 It's like, I built multi million dollar bankrolls

1:27:16.440 --> 1:27:18.000
 before any of that stuff existed.

1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:20.160
 And I did it the good old fashioned way

1:27:20.160 --> 1:27:21.720
 by sitting my butt on the table.

1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:24.040
 I think probably one of my biggest strengths

1:27:24.040 --> 1:27:25.600
 is self awareness.

1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:29.080
 And in that regard, a level of humility

1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:31.960
 that always allows me to say, okay, well, you know what?

1:27:31.960 --> 1:27:34.440
 In this case with these players, they're better than me.

1:27:34.440 --> 1:27:36.200
 So what am I going to learn from them, right?

1:27:36.200 --> 1:27:38.040
 Rather than have this need to say,

1:27:38.040 --> 1:27:40.040
 I'm the best because of history.

1:27:40.040 --> 1:27:41.520
 I'm always looking to guys and go, wow,

1:27:41.520 --> 1:27:42.440
 he does this really well.

1:27:42.440 --> 1:27:45.600
 Whether it's the Adamos or the Ivies or whoever it may be.

1:27:46.640 --> 1:27:49.000
 So my willingness to adapt, I think,

1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:53.320
 and stay relevant by learning what the young guys are learning

1:27:53.320 --> 1:27:54.760
 is something I've always done.

1:27:54.760 --> 1:27:58.160
 And I also pride myself on, again, being well rounded,

1:27:58.160 --> 1:27:59.240
 like playing all the games.

1:27:59.240 --> 1:28:02.560
 Like I don't feel intimidated in any game,

1:28:02.560 --> 1:28:04.440
 you know, whatever the format is.

1:28:04.440 --> 1:28:06.960
 So always being a scholar of the game

1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:09.720
 as the game evolves, as the different games evolve,

1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:12.160
 the different players evolve, the culture evolves,

1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:13.920
 always adjusting by being a scholar,

1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:14.760
 having the humility to be a scholar.

1:28:14.760 --> 1:28:18.000
 A healthy respect for, a healthy respect

1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:20.120
 for the younger generation, how they learn,

1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:22.320
 what they learn and what they can teach me,

1:28:22.320 --> 1:28:25.600
 rather than poo poo it and say, oh, these kids today.

1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:26.760
 Cause that's what a lot of people,

1:28:26.760 --> 1:28:29.560
 like the Mike Matisos and the Phil Hellmuth, my generation,

1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:32.040
 they just poo poo it because they don't understand it.

1:28:32.040 --> 1:28:33.680
 On a level of one to 10,

1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:36.720
 their level of understanding of this is like a one, maybe.

1:28:36.720 --> 1:28:38.560
 If I'm being generous by calling it a one,

1:28:38.560 --> 1:28:39.840
 they really don't understand it.

1:28:39.840 --> 1:28:41.760
 So they poo poo it, right?

1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:42.720
 It's easy to do that.

1:28:42.720 --> 1:28:44.040
 Like, oh, that's not how I do it.

1:28:44.040 --> 1:28:46.560
 So that's wrong or that's stupid or whatever.

1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:47.560
 I don't take that approach.

1:28:47.560 --> 1:28:48.640
 I go, well, let me learn.

1:28:48.640 --> 1:28:50.480
 Let me see what there is to this.

1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:53.080
 But that said, the crankiness that Matisos

1:28:53.080 --> 1:28:55.160
 and Phil Hellmuth have is great to watch,

1:28:55.160 --> 1:28:57.440
 especially when they're on a table with you.

1:28:57.440 --> 1:28:58.280
 Oh, I love it.

1:28:58.280 --> 1:29:00.480
 Yeah, it's a blast.

1:29:00.480 --> 1:29:03.560
 You're masterful at being able to get under their skin.

1:29:03.560 --> 1:29:06.280
 What about somebody from the new school,

1:29:06.280 --> 1:29:11.280
 like Justin Bonomo, who's leading in terms of cash wins.

1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:12.880
 Is there somebody like that,

1:29:12.880 --> 1:29:17.520
 that stands out to you as a potential GOAT status person?

1:29:17.520 --> 1:29:20.520
 Yeah, so there's two different ones, but one is very...

1:29:20.520 --> 1:29:23.080
 So they're both just no limit, right?

1:29:23.080 --> 1:29:24.920
 So again, when I think of poker,

1:29:24.920 --> 1:29:26.920
 I think of a variety of games,

1:29:26.920 --> 1:29:29.200
 but there's so many of the young guys that specialize.

1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:31.240
 Michael Adamo is one that I've mentioned several times

1:29:31.240 --> 1:29:32.680
 and I love the way that he approaches the game.

1:29:32.680 --> 1:29:34.160
 Another one that's highly respected

1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:37.040
 because of his online prowess and his...

1:29:37.040 --> 1:29:39.480
 People have looked and how close he is to game theory

1:29:39.480 --> 1:29:41.280
 and they say he's about as perfect as you get.

1:29:41.280 --> 1:29:43.200
 And I got a kid named Linus.

1:29:43.200 --> 1:29:46.360
 Linus love online, Linus Linger.

1:29:46.360 --> 1:29:50.400
 So he just came second recently, I believe in the Triton,

1:29:50.400 --> 1:29:51.240
 huge Triton event.

1:29:51.240 --> 1:29:52.600
 So he's primarily an online player.

1:29:52.600 --> 1:29:54.360
 Yeah, he's an online cash player for the most part,

1:29:54.360 --> 1:29:55.360
 but he plays some live.

1:29:55.360 --> 1:29:58.760
 And he's, again, and I respect the peers that I play with

1:29:58.760 --> 1:30:00.680
 who say, yeah, he's tough as nails.

1:30:00.680 --> 1:30:05.680
 There's another kid too, Russian kid named Timofey Kuznetsov

1:30:06.160 --> 1:30:08.840
 and he plays all the games and he's well respected

1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:10.840
 in that regard.

1:30:10.840 --> 1:30:12.880
 And same with a guy like a Jungleman, Dan Cates,

1:30:12.880 --> 1:30:14.320
 who's a unique personality.

1:30:14.320 --> 1:30:17.400
 I mean, this guy showed up, won the poker players championship

1:30:17.400 --> 1:30:20.800
 back to back years in a Randy Macho Man Savage costume.

1:30:20.800 --> 1:30:23.200
 And he was doing Macho Man the entire time.

1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:27.480
 Oh yeah, I'm gonna take all the chips like I did last year.

1:30:27.480 --> 1:30:28.320
 Bust them all.

1:30:28.320 --> 1:30:30.480
 And he was in character for the entirety of the tournament.

1:30:30.480 --> 1:30:31.320
 This is great.

1:30:31.320 --> 1:30:32.160
 Just unique.

1:30:32.160 --> 1:30:35.040
 But yeah, I respect for a lot of those guys.

1:30:35.040 --> 1:30:36.920
 Is it gonna take time to figure out

1:30:36.920 --> 1:30:40.160
 who stands the test of time?

1:30:40.160 --> 1:30:41.440
 That's the thing, right?

1:30:41.440 --> 1:30:42.520
 So a lot of these kids,

1:30:42.520 --> 1:30:44.920
 like there was a guy who beat me heads up

1:30:44.920 --> 1:30:46.560
 in the million dollar one drop.

1:30:46.560 --> 1:30:49.840
 I got 8.7, he won $15 million, kid named Dan Coleman.

1:30:49.840 --> 1:30:53.400
 He was seen as like the next big thing in poker, right?

1:30:53.400 --> 1:30:56.160
 He made his money, just wasn't for him.

1:30:56.160 --> 1:30:58.160
 So he's moved on to doing what he's doing,

1:30:58.160 --> 1:31:00.040
 skiing in the Alps, whatever.

1:31:00.040 --> 1:31:02.320
 We have nobody seen him from like five, six years.

1:31:02.320 --> 1:31:04.640
 So that can happen, right?

1:31:04.640 --> 1:31:06.000
 Because there is a lot of burnout.

1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:09.200
 I think it was actually a Gotham Chess

1:31:09.200 --> 1:31:12.280
 who mentioned something about how difficult it is to like,

1:31:12.280 --> 1:31:13.120
 I think it's true in poker.

1:31:13.120 --> 1:31:15.080
 When you get really, really good at something,

1:31:15.080 --> 1:31:18.920
 to get this much better takes so much work.

1:31:18.920 --> 1:31:21.360
 And a lot of people don't necessarily wanna put in

1:31:21.360 --> 1:31:23.440
 that kind of work in order to do that.

1:31:23.440 --> 1:31:25.560
 That's just even staying at the same level

1:31:25.560 --> 1:31:27.160
 takes a huge amount of work.

1:31:27.160 --> 1:31:28.520
 Like, so if you wanna get better at chess,

1:31:28.520 --> 1:31:29.600
 you're already like really, really good.

1:31:29.600 --> 1:31:31.560
 And you're trying to get like one little bit better.

1:31:31.560 --> 1:31:34.800
 You have to study like in a ridiculous amount, you know?

1:31:34.800 --> 1:31:37.040
 And again, that's once you've already had,

1:31:37.040 --> 1:31:38.480
 I think the toughest thing for anybody,

1:31:38.480 --> 1:31:40.080
 once you've tasted success

1:31:40.080 --> 1:31:41.800
 and you've already achieved it,

1:31:41.800 --> 1:31:43.800
 staying hungry, staying on the top,

1:31:43.800 --> 1:31:47.680
 reaching the top is much easier than it is to stay there.

1:31:47.680 --> 1:31:49.000
 Yeah.

1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:53.320
 Over years, what's your training regimen in poker

1:31:53.320 --> 1:31:58.320
 in terms of how you keep improving?

1:31:58.360 --> 1:31:59.760
 So you said you study games,

1:31:59.760 --> 1:32:03.600
 but that's mostly leading up to a particular tournament.

1:32:03.600 --> 1:32:07.800
 But is there kind of a behind the scenes daily activity

1:32:07.800 --> 1:32:11.560
 you try to do that kind of over time keeps you sharp?

1:32:11.560 --> 1:32:12.960
 So for me, now that I'm 47,

1:32:12.960 --> 1:32:17.320
 and I feel like the predominant aspect of my poker game

1:32:17.320 --> 1:32:19.200
 is going to be in terms of my success

1:32:19.200 --> 1:32:21.560
 is gonna be my mental state, right?

1:32:21.560 --> 1:32:23.840
 So I find it's really, really important for me now

1:32:23.840 --> 1:32:26.680
 at this age to have balance.

1:32:26.680 --> 1:32:29.640
 So when I'm not playing poker and I'm out of it,

1:32:30.600 --> 1:32:32.320
 poker is not even on my radar.

1:32:32.320 --> 1:32:34.320
 You're able to remove it from your mind.

1:32:34.320 --> 1:32:37.160
 Doing my fantasy hockey, play a little chess,

1:32:37.160 --> 1:32:40.000
 you know, play some golf, watch some hockey,

1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:41.400
 whatever the case may be,

1:32:41.400 --> 1:32:42.680
 outside of the game.

1:32:42.680 --> 1:32:43.800
 And then I start to get the itch.

1:32:43.800 --> 1:32:45.680
 Like after the World Series of Poker,

1:32:46.760 --> 1:32:47.960
 the poker door was closed.

1:32:47.960 --> 1:32:49.240
 Yeah, you took some time off.

1:32:49.240 --> 1:32:51.400
 All of August, I didn't play any poker at all

1:32:51.400 --> 1:32:53.040
 until just recently, you know.

1:32:53.040 --> 1:32:54.440
 I started to get the itch again.

1:32:54.440 --> 1:32:55.800
 Because that's what's important for me,

1:32:55.800 --> 1:32:58.200
 is if I don't have the itch and I don't want to play poker,

1:32:58.200 --> 1:32:59.680
 then I'm not gonna be at my best.

1:32:59.680 --> 1:33:01.400
 Once I start getting the itch,

1:33:01.400 --> 1:33:02.480
 that's when I start to say,

1:33:02.480 --> 1:33:04.600
 okay, let's start watching some of these streams.

1:33:04.600 --> 1:33:06.800
 Let's see what my opponents are up to lately.

1:33:06.800 --> 1:33:09.280
 And, you know, let's look at some solvers

1:33:09.280 --> 1:33:10.920
 and different things like that.

1:33:10.920 --> 1:33:12.360
 And you're doing pretty good.

1:33:12.360 --> 1:33:14.320
 You came back and doing pretty good.

1:33:15.360 --> 1:33:16.200
 Yeah, so far.

1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:18.560
 Do you like being in front of the camera

1:33:18.560 --> 1:33:21.600
 through the hell of the World Series of Poker this year?

1:33:21.600 --> 1:33:23.160
 You filmed every single day.

1:33:23.160 --> 1:33:24.280
 You did a vlog.

1:33:24.280 --> 1:33:25.360
 Does that energize you?

1:33:25.360 --> 1:33:26.200
 Is that exhausting?

1:33:26.200 --> 1:33:28.360
 Because it's really beneficial to a huge amount of people.

1:33:28.360 --> 1:33:30.520
 It energizes the poker community.

1:33:30.520 --> 1:33:32.160
 But do you see it as a service

1:33:32.160 --> 1:33:34.640
 or do you purely just love it?

1:33:34.640 --> 1:33:37.280
 I've been comfortable on camera since I was a kid.

1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:39.120
 When I was a kid, I wanted to be an actor.

1:33:39.120 --> 1:33:40.360
 Like really, really young.

1:33:40.360 --> 1:33:42.960
 And I was always comfortable in that environment.

1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:45.720
 I think like that gives me a little bit of an advantage

1:33:45.720 --> 1:33:47.880
 sometimes too, with these film events.

1:33:47.880 --> 1:33:49.240
 Cause I'm comfortable with the mic on

1:33:49.240 --> 1:33:50.840
 and on camera with the lights.

1:33:50.840 --> 1:33:52.400
 And I think a lot of people maybe aren't

1:33:52.400 --> 1:33:53.880
 with the knowledge that other people

1:33:53.880 --> 1:33:55.400
 are gonna see what they're doing every day.

1:33:55.400 --> 1:33:57.080
 So it's been so comfortable and easy for me.

1:33:57.080 --> 1:33:58.680
 As far as the World Series goes

1:33:58.680 --> 1:34:00.680
 and the vlogs and all the shooting,

1:34:00.680 --> 1:34:02.240
 it's kind of therapeutic for me.

1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:06.520
 It is essentially my version of journaling, right?

1:34:06.520 --> 1:34:08.040
 So there's a lot of value, I think,

1:34:08.040 --> 1:34:10.120
 in like at the end of a day doing a brain dump

1:34:10.120 --> 1:34:11.880
 where you just write out and journal.

1:34:11.880 --> 1:34:15.480
 But doing it on camera has this similar effect.

1:34:15.480 --> 1:34:19.600
 And it also, when you make a mistake on your own,

1:34:19.600 --> 1:34:20.840
 you're held accountable to you.

1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:23.280
 But when I have to explain it to others,

1:34:23.280 --> 1:34:24.920
 like here's what I did.

1:34:24.920 --> 1:34:26.240
 And this is the mistake I made

1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:27.680
 or whatever the case may be.

1:34:28.760 --> 1:34:31.000
 It actually, I think that helps me.

1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:34.440
 Yeah, so you're held responsible by a larger audience.

1:34:34.440 --> 1:34:35.640
 I think it's like, so like I said,

1:34:35.640 --> 1:34:38.400
 listen, I'm 47, my life is good.

1:34:38.400 --> 1:34:39.560
 I don't have to be in this tournament.

1:34:39.560 --> 1:34:42.920
 If I'm over it, I can just dump my chips off and go home.

1:34:42.920 --> 1:34:45.240
 But I can't when I'm doing the vlog,

1:34:45.240 --> 1:34:48.080
 like I have to actually answer to that.

1:34:49.120 --> 1:34:51.080
 And it keeps me in line.

1:34:51.080 --> 1:34:53.960
 How hard is it to win the main event

1:34:53.960 --> 1:34:56.240
 of the World Series of Poker?

1:34:56.240 --> 1:34:57.600
 So the main event of the World Series of Poker

1:34:57.600 --> 1:34:59.320
 is the hardest event to win

1:34:59.320 --> 1:35:01.640
 simply because of the sheer size of it.

1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:04.320
 You're talking seven, 8,000 players, right?

1:35:04.320 --> 1:35:05.440
 And a lot of landmines.

1:35:05.440 --> 1:35:08.800
 And frankly, there are so many players

1:35:08.800 --> 1:35:10.840
 that you've not played with before too.

1:35:10.840 --> 1:35:12.880
 You play these high roller events, like the super ones,

1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:15.360
 you get 30, 40 people, you know everybody, right?

1:35:15.360 --> 1:35:16.880
 So you have an idea.

1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:19.240
 You sit at the main event, you don't have any idea.

1:35:19.240 --> 1:35:21.040
 This guy wearing a Philadelphia Eagles jersey

1:35:21.040 --> 1:35:23.200
 and sunglasses, and he just raised you big.

1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:26.120
 I don't know this guy, I don't know what he's about.

1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:29.280
 So there's a lot of like, it's grueling too.

1:35:29.280 --> 1:35:32.720
 You're seven, eight days where you're in the blender

1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:35.200
 as you might say, so.

1:35:35.200 --> 1:35:36.120
 So what's the structure?

1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:38.640
 So it's $10,000 buy in or something like that.

1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:41.960
 And there's a bunch of tables and you just keep playing.

1:35:41.960 --> 1:35:44.800
 Like when is it over for a single table?

1:35:44.800 --> 1:35:45.640
 Does it go?

1:35:45.640 --> 1:35:46.480
 So the way that it works is this.

1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:47.840
 So there's, let's say 8,000 players.

1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:50.180
 And the way the main event works, unique to others,

1:35:50.180 --> 1:35:53.240
 is there's various day ones you can play, right?

1:35:53.240 --> 1:35:55.160
 So a day one, you're gonna play from noon

1:35:55.160 --> 1:35:57.320
 till like midnight, right?

1:35:57.320 --> 1:36:00.040
 If you're still in, you bag up your chips

1:36:00.040 --> 1:36:02.080
 and you'll come back for day two, okay?

1:36:02.080 --> 1:36:04.360
 There's four different day ones, right?

1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:07.040
 Now they'll all combine essentially to play on a day two.

1:36:07.040 --> 1:36:09.800
 And at the end of the night, they redraw the tables.

1:36:09.800 --> 1:36:11.140
 So you don't just win your table.

1:36:11.140 --> 1:36:13.680
 If players get knocked out, tables break,

1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:15.280
 they continue to be replaced.

1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:18.120
 So you start with 8,000, then after day one,

1:36:18.120 --> 1:36:20.940
 you've got 6,000, then you do the same.

1:36:20.940 --> 1:36:25.360
 You play like a 12 hour day and you slowly whittle down.

1:36:25.360 --> 1:36:28.520
 Day four, day three, day four, you're in the money.

1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:29.840
 And then you continue to progress.

1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:32.480
 And then what they do now with the final table is they,

1:36:32.480 --> 1:36:34.360
 because they were trying to do this for TV,

1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:38.760
 these final tables can take, you know, 12 hours to play.

1:36:38.760 --> 1:36:41.080
 And what we were finding was, you know,

1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:44.560
 you start the thing at 5 p.m. and it goes till 8 a.m.

1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:45.960
 And like nobody's watching anymore.

1:36:45.960 --> 1:36:49.320
 So they separate into three days now.

1:36:49.320 --> 1:36:52.160
 And so you're talking now, it's like six, seven days

1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:54.620
 to get to the final table and another three days to play it.

1:36:54.620 --> 1:36:58.840
 So you're grinding for, you know, a week and a half.

1:36:58.840 --> 1:37:01.880
 But most of the time you're playing against people

1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:03.840
 you've never played against before.

1:37:03.840 --> 1:37:04.880
 Especially early on, yeah.

1:37:04.880 --> 1:37:06.440
 And then by the end, like, who knows?

1:37:06.440 --> 1:37:09.580
 You know, rarely do you see, you see in the last hundred,

1:37:09.580 --> 1:37:11.480
 you usually see some notable names.

1:37:11.480 --> 1:37:13.760
 Then in the last 27, you might see one, maybe two.

1:37:13.760 --> 1:37:15.460
 Final table, maybe one.

1:37:15.460 --> 1:37:17.600
 But often it's gonna be, you know,

1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:20.040
 some players you've never heard of before.

1:37:20.040 --> 1:37:24.080
 Is there strategies that maximize your likelihood

1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:25.440
 of having a chance?

1:37:25.440 --> 1:37:26.400
 Yes, absolutely.

1:37:26.400 --> 1:37:28.000
 Like I think the World Series of Poker main event

1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.280
 is a unique animal in that, you know,

1:37:30.280 --> 1:37:32.360
 like we talk about game theory and all that kind of stuff.

1:37:32.360 --> 1:37:34.160
 If you're focused on that when you're playing,

1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:36.660
 you're really not playing well, right?

1:37:36.660 --> 1:37:38.280
 You need to just exploit

1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:39.600
 because you're gonna have a lot of people

1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:41.280
 who see this as a bucket list item.

1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:42.120
 You know, they just wanna play

1:37:42.120 --> 1:37:43.560
 the main event in the World Series.

1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:45.880
 And they might be scared, they might be nervous or whatever.

1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:48.760
 You don't have to worry about being balanced, right?

1:37:48.760 --> 1:37:51.160
 Oh, you know, I have to make sure that I'm, no you don't.

1:37:51.160 --> 1:37:52.640
 You might not, you're playing with this guy now

1:37:52.640 --> 1:37:54.720
 for three hours, you might never see him again.

1:37:54.720 --> 1:37:57.680
 So just make the play that makes sense for you, right?

1:37:57.680 --> 1:38:01.000
 So yeah, you're gonna, I approach that event

1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:02.640
 very differently than I would

1:38:02.640 --> 1:38:04.760
 like playing against the high roller players

1:38:04.760 --> 1:38:05.600
 that I play with today.

1:38:05.600 --> 1:38:07.200
 Does that mean more aggressive essentially?

1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:08.760
 Less actually.

1:38:08.760 --> 1:38:11.880
 So when you play against really good players,

1:38:11.880 --> 1:38:15.440
 you have to take small plus EV scenarios

1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:17.000
 where you push the envelope

1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:18.120
 and you're playing really aggressive.

1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:19.440
 You're bluffing off your stack.

1:38:19.440 --> 1:38:20.280
 You gotta do this.

1:38:20.280 --> 1:38:22.720
 You gotta focus a little bit more on being balanced

1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:23.760
 because otherwise, you know,

1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:25.460
 you're not gonna beat these guys.

1:38:25.460 --> 1:38:27.120
 Whereas if you're playing with amateurs

1:38:27.120 --> 1:38:28.800
 and you're playing with regular players,

1:38:28.800 --> 1:38:33.200
 for the most part, risking all your chips on a bluff,

1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:34.720
 probably don't need to do that.

1:38:34.720 --> 1:38:35.760
 You don't need to do that nearly as much.

1:38:35.760 --> 1:38:39.360
 You can probably slowly but surely build your stack

1:38:39.360 --> 1:38:41.160
 without taking, you know, those high risk,

1:38:41.160 --> 1:38:42.000
 high variance situations

1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:44.060
 because you'll find better situations.

1:38:44.060 --> 1:38:47.240
 What mistakes do amateurs usually make

1:38:47.240 --> 1:38:48.720
 in tournaments like that?

1:38:48.720 --> 1:38:50.160
 Are they over bluffing?

1:38:50.160 --> 1:38:52.300
 Well, I think amateurs generally,

1:38:52.300 --> 1:38:53.720
 the biggest mistake they make is they think

1:38:53.720 --> 1:38:56.240
 that pros are bluffing more than they are.

1:38:56.240 --> 1:38:57.960
 So like a pro will bet all his chips on the end

1:38:57.960 --> 1:38:58.960
 and they're like, ah, I don't know.

1:38:58.960 --> 1:39:00.440
 Maybe, you know, it's Phil Ivey.

1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:01.480
 Maybe he's doing some crazy stuff.

1:39:01.480 --> 1:39:02.960
 He's like, probably not.

1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:05.760
 He's probably just got it, you know?

1:39:05.760 --> 1:39:08.020
 And then they lose all their money by calling

1:39:08.020 --> 1:39:09.640
 or going all in as well.

1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:15.040
 And so the right thing is to be more patient.

1:39:15.040 --> 1:39:19.080
 So amateur is too impatient or just bad reads?

1:39:19.080 --> 1:39:21.160
 So all the amateurs are built different.

1:39:21.160 --> 1:39:23.400
 Some of the amateurs are just too weak and passive.

1:39:23.400 --> 1:39:25.440
 They're just waiting for the nuts, you know?

1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:27.360
 And then, you know, the pros, everyone notices that.

1:39:27.360 --> 1:39:29.200
 And then when they make their big hand,

1:39:29.200 --> 1:39:30.640
 they don't get paid anyway.

1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:32.840
 So in order to win the main event,

1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:35.000
 I mean, you have to have some components

1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:36.520
 of your game that are aggressive.

1:39:36.520 --> 1:39:39.960
 It's very unlikely to expect to just get the cards

1:39:39.960 --> 1:39:42.440
 the whole way and just always have the best hand.

1:39:42.440 --> 1:39:44.560
 You're gonna have to find ways to win pots

1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:47.080
 that, you know, where you don't have the best hand.

1:39:47.080 --> 1:39:49.640
 How do you win the final table?

1:39:49.640 --> 1:39:51.200
 The final table is unique now,

1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:53.440
 especially because you're talking about the way

1:39:53.440 --> 1:39:55.520
 that poker works in tournaments is that

1:39:55.520 --> 1:39:56.900
 if there's seven people left

1:39:56.900 --> 1:39:59.560
 and you have just, you know, you're very short on chips.

1:39:59.560 --> 1:40:01.520
 But if one other player goes out,

1:40:01.520 --> 1:40:04.640
 you just make like $300,000 for folding,

1:40:04.640 --> 1:40:06.760
 like just for sitting out, right?

1:40:06.760 --> 1:40:08.800
 The term for that that, you know,

1:40:08.800 --> 1:40:13.080
 show kids uses ICM, independent, you know, chip model,

1:40:13.080 --> 1:40:15.460
 right, where it talks about the value of each chip.

1:40:15.460 --> 1:40:17.440
 Where what happens, what we see now is,

1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:19.600
 let's say one guy has a big chip lead

1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:21.340
 and there's another guy who's second in chips

1:40:21.340 --> 1:40:22.760
 and there's a couple that are short.

1:40:22.760 --> 1:40:25.960
 These guys in the middle, they just play super tight

1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:28.280
 and they wait for the little guys to go

1:40:28.280 --> 1:40:31.600
 while the big stack is just pounding them

1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:33.520
 because he can afford to, right?

1:40:33.520 --> 1:40:35.000
 He knows that people are handcuffed.

1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:36.840
 So let's say I had 10 million in chips

1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:38.240
 and you have 9 million in chips.

1:40:38.240 --> 1:40:39.160
 And these guys have little chips.

1:40:39.160 --> 1:40:42.040
 If I go all in on you, are you gonna call me

1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:45.320
 and risk like, you know, guaranteed pay jumps

1:40:45.320 --> 1:40:46.680
 of like moving up a few spots?

1:40:46.680 --> 1:40:48.540
 So really the question comes down to like,

1:40:48.540 --> 1:40:51.440
 are you the type of guy who just wants to inch up

1:40:51.440 --> 1:40:52.920
 or are you gonna go for it?

1:40:52.920 --> 1:40:54.000
 And you're gonna go for the win.

1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000
 I think ultimately there's some value

1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:56.920
 in being the guy who says,

1:40:56.920 --> 1:40:58.660
 you know, I don't care if I come seventh.

1:40:58.660 --> 1:41:01.440
 I'm not worried about going from seventh to fifth.

1:41:01.440 --> 1:41:02.560
 I'm here to win.

1:41:02.560 --> 1:41:04.840
 And so you're saying like the guys that win

1:41:04.840 --> 1:41:07.080
 will often be the ones that call there.

1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:10.800
 So like, they're not just bullying the small stacks, they're.

1:41:10.800 --> 1:41:11.800
 Well, they're the ones,

1:41:11.800 --> 1:41:14.480
 no, they're the ones that are willing to risk it, right?

1:41:14.480 --> 1:41:16.800
 So there are some people who, you know,

1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:19.800
 if there's five left, you know,

1:41:19.800 --> 1:41:21.200
 and they're third in chips

1:41:21.200 --> 1:41:22.320
 and there's two guys very short

1:41:22.320 --> 1:41:24.280
 and you, you know, they'll have ace king

1:41:24.280 --> 1:41:26.060
 and someone moves, they'll just fold.

1:41:26.060 --> 1:41:28.760
 They fold the hand because they wanna wait

1:41:28.760 --> 1:41:30.620
 for those two other players to get broke.

1:41:30.620 --> 1:41:32.280
 And that way they let you know, they make actual money.

1:41:32.280 --> 1:41:33.640
 So you, I guess the thought process

1:41:33.640 --> 1:41:35.280
 between winning first place

1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:37.440
 and winning the most amount of money are different.

1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:39.240
 They're conflicting, right?

1:41:39.240 --> 1:41:41.360
 Because in order to like win,

1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:43.180
 if you're just, if your focus is only on winning

1:41:43.180 --> 1:41:45.040
 the tournament, you will make mistakes financially

1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:47.680
 where you had guaranteed income for just folding, right?

1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:51.540
 Let's say a guy has one chip left, you know, one chip

1:41:51.540 --> 1:41:53.320
 and me and you have good chips

1:41:53.320 --> 1:41:55.240
 and I go all in with you and I lose.

1:41:55.240 --> 1:41:57.680
 Now that guy, you know, got the guaranteed,

1:41:57.680 --> 1:41:59.460
 you know, he got the pay jump that I wouldn't have got.

1:41:59.460 --> 1:42:00.840
 So there's some extremely stupid mistakes

1:42:00.840 --> 1:42:02.780
 you can make from a financial perspective,

1:42:02.780 --> 1:42:05.580
 but it's often at odds with, you know,

1:42:05.580 --> 1:42:08.720
 giving yourself the best chance to actually come first.

1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:11.240
 And in a tournament, especially the main event,

1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:15.080
 especially the final table, it's all about coming in first.

1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:17.520
 Well, I know because most of the people who make it,

1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:19.420
 so like, you know, when you play these high rollers,

1:42:19.420 --> 1:42:21.520
 these guys are accustomed to playing for a hundred thousand,

1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:23.040
 they're, they're accustomed to this kind of money.

1:42:23.040 --> 1:42:24.240
 So they're going to play, right?

1:42:24.240 --> 1:42:25.760
 For the most, but you're talking about guys

1:42:25.760 --> 1:42:27.240
 who bought into a $10,000 tournament,

1:42:27.240 --> 1:42:29.600
 maybe never had a hundred K cash in their life.

1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:32.500
 And now they're sitting there and it's like 1 million

1:42:32.500 --> 1:42:34.340
 for fifth and 2 million for fourth.

1:42:35.480 --> 1:42:37.400
 So like, they don't want to be fifth,

1:42:37.400 --> 1:42:39.640
 they're just going to sit there and go, ah, I don't want.

1:42:39.640 --> 1:42:41.760
 So they'll, they'll be under more financial pressure

1:42:41.760 --> 1:42:44.440
 because they're not like your typical high roller

1:42:44.440 --> 1:42:45.260
 type player.

1:42:45.260 --> 1:42:48.920
 Are you still able to find the guts to take big risks?

1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:50.800
 Yeah, see, I'm trying to win.

1:42:50.800 --> 1:42:53.180
 Like, I think that gives me an advantage, frankly,

1:42:53.180 --> 1:42:57.320
 where I might make decisions that are financially suboptimal

1:42:57.320 --> 1:42:58.880
 because I'm trying to win,

1:42:58.880 --> 1:43:01.040
 but there's also an inherent advantage to that.

1:43:01.040 --> 1:43:04.040
 Like that again, something I watched and learned

1:43:04.040 --> 1:43:05.880
 from a guy like Michael Adamo,

1:43:05.880 --> 1:43:08.040
 where he takes advantage of these people playing

1:43:08.040 --> 1:43:09.920
 so passively in these spots where he's like,

1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:11.920
 I don't, I'm not trying to come, I'm going to win.

1:43:11.920 --> 1:43:14.120
 I'm just going to bull bulldoze you.

1:43:14.120 --> 1:43:16.160
 Cause I'm not worried about, you know,

1:43:16.160 --> 1:43:21.160
 the small financial mistake of, you know, a pay jump.

1:43:21.520 --> 1:43:25.560
 What advice could you give to, to beginning poker players?

1:43:25.560 --> 1:43:27.760
 Actually at every level, how to get better,

1:43:27.760 --> 1:43:30.240
 how to improve, how to improve their game.

1:43:30.240 --> 1:43:32.140
 Obviously, as you said,

1:43:32.140 --> 1:43:34.900
 it's easiest to get better in the beginning,

1:43:34.900 --> 1:43:37.320
 but what advice would you give how to get better?

1:43:37.320 --> 1:43:38.320
 So one of the ways, I mean,

1:43:38.320 --> 1:43:40.200
 I think way back to the how I started, right?

1:43:40.200 --> 1:43:42.480
 And there's so many resources and tools available right now

1:43:42.480 --> 1:43:45.960
 to analyze hands, but when you play, right?

1:43:45.960 --> 1:43:48.400
 And you find yourself in a situation or a hand

1:43:48.400 --> 1:43:49.320
 that you're not really sure about,

1:43:49.320 --> 1:43:52.440
 not because you had aces and went all in and you lost,

1:43:52.440 --> 1:43:53.560
 like that's not interesting,

1:43:53.560 --> 1:43:55.200
 but an interesting situation where you're not sure

1:43:55.200 --> 1:43:59.200
 what you did, jot the hand down, write it out.

1:43:59.200 --> 1:44:02.000
 And then either A, you know, use some of the tools,

1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:04.800
 whether it's the solvers, if you're advanced enough,

1:44:04.800 --> 1:44:07.240
 or ask your group, you know,

1:44:07.240 --> 1:44:09.080
 like have a couple of friends at your level

1:44:09.080 --> 1:44:10.760
 and talk through the different decisions

1:44:10.760 --> 1:44:12.620
 and start to learn that way, right?

1:44:12.620 --> 1:44:13.860
 Cause those mistakes that you make

1:44:13.860 --> 1:44:15.620
 or those tough, those tough hands,

1:44:15.620 --> 1:44:17.280
 that's where the real learning comes from.

1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:19.720
 Like, so that next, so basically if you're,

1:44:19.720 --> 1:44:21.480
 cause you're gonna be in similar scenarios.

1:44:21.480 --> 1:44:24.320
 In poker, you're rarely gonna have the identical situation,

1:44:24.320 --> 1:44:26.520
 but you'll have situations that are similar.

1:44:26.520 --> 1:44:28.600
 You know, you raise with ace king, someone three bet,

1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:29.760
 another guy goes all in.

1:44:29.760 --> 1:44:31.800
 Okay, well, what do I do in that spot?

1:44:31.800 --> 1:44:34.380
 You know, it's, you're gonna have similar situations

1:44:34.380 --> 1:44:35.220
 in the future as well.

1:44:35.220 --> 1:44:38.120
 So figuring that out, the more you can do that,

1:44:38.120 --> 1:44:40.680
 you chop away at, you know,

1:44:40.680 --> 1:44:42.640
 different strategical mistakes, you know,

1:44:42.640 --> 1:44:44.980
 you used to make that you no longer make.

1:44:44.980 --> 1:44:48.240
 Are there resources like your masterclasses really is great?

1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:49.980
 Are there books?

1:44:49.980 --> 1:44:51.840
 So there was a guy named Michael Acevedo.

1:44:51.840 --> 1:44:54.200
 This is my, again, for a little bit more advanced players,

1:44:54.200 --> 1:44:57.220
 but it's a book called a modern poker theory,

1:44:57.220 --> 1:44:58.740
 I think it's called,

1:44:58.740 --> 1:45:01.080
 which sort of explains game theory, right?

1:45:01.080 --> 1:45:02.840
 To the novice, right?

1:45:02.840 --> 1:45:05.320
 So it's a little bit, I think if you're new to poker,

1:45:05.320 --> 1:45:08.360
 it's probably above the rim for you.

1:45:08.360 --> 1:45:09.960
 But once you start to get a little better

1:45:09.960 --> 1:45:11.580
 and you wanna understand how to do it,

1:45:11.580 --> 1:45:13.360
 it's probably a good resource for as far as books.

1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:14.720
 And there's also like tons of people

1:45:14.720 --> 1:45:17.060
 who stream poker, professional players.

1:45:17.060 --> 1:45:19.040
 And then you can get in there and you get in on the chat

1:45:19.040 --> 1:45:20.460
 and you start talking, you ask them,

1:45:20.460 --> 1:45:21.680
 you see people, you know,

1:45:21.680 --> 1:45:23.880
 explaining their thought process and things like that.

1:45:23.880 --> 1:45:25.360
 There's so many free resources.

1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:26.520
 And of course my masterclass,

1:45:26.520 --> 1:45:28.760
 I think does a good job of sort of compartmentalizing,

1:45:28.760 --> 1:45:32.440
 like, you know, how to attack it on a deeper level.

1:45:32.440 --> 1:45:34.600
 And we, you know, we get it, I try to get into,

1:45:34.600 --> 1:45:36.860
 what's funny when I did the masterclass,

1:45:36.860 --> 1:45:38.820
 I asked them, I was like, well, you know,

1:45:38.820 --> 1:45:41.640
 how high end do you want this in terms of poker?

1:45:41.640 --> 1:45:42.960
 And they're like, we want really, really high end.

1:45:42.960 --> 1:45:44.440
 And I was like, okay, sure.

1:45:44.440 --> 1:45:46.040
 Then I started to explain really, really high end.

1:45:46.040 --> 1:45:50.400
 I'm like, okay, well, maybe the one below that, right?

1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:54.880
 So I try to explain really complex, you know,

1:45:54.880 --> 1:45:58.800
 theory in a more palatable way, in English, if you will.

1:45:58.800 --> 1:46:00.240
 Cause some of these kids, you hear them talk

1:46:00.240 --> 1:46:02.160
 and you'd be like, huh?

1:46:02.160 --> 1:46:06.200
 But you also, which is really nice, give example hands

1:46:07.240 --> 1:46:10.440
 that really illustrate the point, which is really nice.

1:46:10.440 --> 1:46:13.400
 You also wrote a book, I think 10 years ago,

1:46:13.400 --> 1:46:14.880
 Power Holding Strategy.

1:46:16.200 --> 1:46:19.200
 It's interesting to think how much of the stuff

1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:21.320
 in that book still applies, how much doesn't.

1:46:21.320 --> 1:46:23.720
 Listen, I still think the book holds up to a certain degree.

1:46:23.720 --> 1:46:26.400
 Obviously like, you know, it isn't optimal

1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:28.320
 because there's like a more advanced strategies.

1:46:28.320 --> 1:46:29.280
 And if you played that way,

1:46:29.280 --> 1:46:30.880
 people will figure out a way to exploit you.

1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:32.560
 But if you're like an average player playing

1:46:32.560 --> 1:46:35.160
 an average buy ins, like that's sort of what I coined,

1:46:35.160 --> 1:46:38.120
 like small ball approach, absolutely will work.

1:46:38.120 --> 1:46:39.800
 You know, at the highest level,

1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:42.340
 you have to add much more, a lot more bluffing.

1:46:42.340 --> 1:46:44.600
 But overall, I think it's still, you know,

1:46:44.600 --> 1:46:45.760
 for the most part, there's a lot of really,

1:46:45.760 --> 1:46:46.640
 especially with tournaments,

1:46:46.640 --> 1:46:48.920
 there's a lot of really good principles in the book.

1:46:48.920 --> 1:46:50.680
 What's the difference in the dynamics,

1:46:50.680 --> 1:46:53.920
 if you could just comment on between a heads up poker

1:46:53.920 --> 1:46:56.520
 and when multiple people are in one hand,

1:46:56.520 --> 1:46:58.400
 what are interesting aspects to everything

1:46:58.400 --> 1:47:01.320
 we've been talking about from game theory

1:47:01.320 --> 1:47:04.620
 to exploitative strategies, all that kind of stuff.

1:47:04.620 --> 1:47:06.040
 So the biggest difference when you play,

1:47:06.040 --> 1:47:07.700
 let's say nine handed, you know,

1:47:07.700 --> 1:47:11.200
 against eight other players and you know, heads up is,

1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:13.720
 first of all, just the type of hands

1:47:13.720 --> 1:47:15.160
 and the number of hands you're gonna have to play.

1:47:15.160 --> 1:47:18.120
 So the way that it works is if there's nine people,

1:47:18.120 --> 1:47:20.300
 two out of the nine hands, you have to put in money.

1:47:20.300 --> 1:47:22.760
 And the other seven, you could just fold for nothing, okay?

1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:23.800
 When you're heads up,

1:47:23.800 --> 1:47:27.440
 you're forced to put money in every single hand, okay?

1:47:27.440 --> 1:47:29.720
 And there's only one other hand in front of you,

1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:31.720
 which means the ranges of hands that you play

1:47:31.720 --> 1:47:33.480
 is way wider, right?

1:47:33.480 --> 1:47:35.040
 So if you're nine handed, right?

1:47:35.040 --> 1:47:36.720
 And you're in first position, you're like, all right,

1:47:36.720 --> 1:47:37.880
 what do I need to play?

1:47:37.880 --> 1:47:41.680
 Like a good pair, you know, two high cards suited,

1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:44.160
 a big ace, you know, stuff like that, that's it, right?

1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:46.320
 That's what you're gonna play, right?

1:47:46.320 --> 1:47:47.600
 And you're gonna fold all the rest.

1:47:47.600 --> 1:47:50.600
 When you're heads up, you look at a king and a two

1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:52.360
 and you're like, well, I gotta play this.

1:47:52.360 --> 1:47:53.540
 You know, you're gonna, you're gonna,

1:47:53.540 --> 1:47:55.720
 you're forced to play a lot more hands

1:47:55.720 --> 1:47:57.400
 in a lot more complex situations

1:47:57.400 --> 1:47:59.860
 when you're playing heads up,

1:47:59.860 --> 1:48:02.520
 because you're gonna be playing much far weaker hands.

1:48:02.520 --> 1:48:05.480
 Queen five, Jack three, all these types of hands.

1:48:05.480 --> 1:48:06.920
 And you're gonna see flops where you're,

1:48:06.920 --> 1:48:08.600
 you're not gonna have the luxury of being like,

1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:11.680
 I'm in there with a premium hand, queens, kings, aces.

1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:13.080
 Those are easier to play, right?

1:48:13.080 --> 1:48:14.680
 Very, very strong holdings.

1:48:14.680 --> 1:48:19.360
 Heads up, you're forced to dance and fight a lot more.

1:48:19.360 --> 1:48:21.520
 You know, you can't sit in the weeds and wait.

1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:22.720
 What do you enjoy more?

1:48:24.640 --> 1:48:25.700
 Heads up is very intense.

1:48:25.700 --> 1:48:29.520
 I like heads up, but I think if you had to play heads up

1:48:29.520 --> 1:48:31.960
 eight, 10 hours, it's so mentally draining

1:48:31.960 --> 1:48:34.760
 because your face with so many constant decisions

1:48:34.760 --> 1:48:35.600
 each and every spot.

1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:37.980
 Like you play nine handed, you look at a nine and a three,

1:48:37.980 --> 1:48:40.720
 you throw it away, you hang out for a bit, relax,

1:48:40.720 --> 1:48:42.240
 you go, you get a little break and then play hand.

1:48:42.240 --> 1:48:44.000
 Heads up, you're like, it's like, boom, boom.

1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:45.200
 It's like you're in the ring, you know,

1:48:45.200 --> 1:48:47.640
 you're in the octagon and you're facing like

1:48:47.640 --> 1:48:49.040
 haymakers nonstop.

1:48:50.680 --> 1:48:53.720
 Since we talked about online a bit,

1:48:53.720 --> 1:48:56.840
 is it possible to cheat in poker, especially online?

1:48:56.840 --> 1:49:00.320
 So we offline also talked about the cheating controversy

1:49:00.320 --> 1:49:02.120
 that's going on in the chess world.

1:49:02.120 --> 1:49:06.660
 Is it possible to use, what is it?

1:49:06.660 --> 1:49:10.980
 Remotely connected anal beads to somehow cheat?

1:49:10.980 --> 1:49:15.820
 No, is that a concern of cheating online?

1:49:15.820 --> 1:49:19.140
 So here's the thing, it's kind of like romanticized

1:49:19.140 --> 1:49:21.280
 from the old days, like, you know, in the Western stuff,

1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:22.120
 like people trying to cheat.

1:49:22.120 --> 1:49:24.140
 And have you ever killed a man because he cheated?

1:49:24.140 --> 1:49:25.100
 No, I have not.

1:49:25.100 --> 1:49:26.980
 But when I started out as a teenager,

1:49:26.980 --> 1:49:28.820
 I played in a game with a bunch of Italians

1:49:28.820 --> 1:49:31.160
 and I knew they cheated and I didn't care

1:49:31.160 --> 1:49:33.700
 because they were so bad that I could win anyway.

1:49:33.700 --> 1:49:34.780
 I was like, I knew they would cheat,

1:49:34.780 --> 1:49:35.700
 but I knew how they were cheating.

1:49:35.700 --> 1:49:37.140
 So I was like, all right, you guys suck.

1:49:37.140 --> 1:49:37.980
 But so here's the thing,

1:49:37.980 --> 1:49:40.960
 anytime you're talking about large sums of money,

1:49:40.960 --> 1:49:43.580
 there will be people looking to take advantage,

1:49:43.580 --> 1:49:45.820
 whether that's live or online, right?

1:49:45.820 --> 1:49:49.620
 And so it's like the job essentially of the, you know,

1:49:49.620 --> 1:49:52.940
 the online operators or the, you know, live event staff

1:49:52.940 --> 1:49:54.560
 to police it the best they can.

1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:56.620
 And the players themselves being on the lookout for it.

1:49:56.620 --> 1:49:58.940
 You know, like a guy like Dole Brunson is a great resource

1:49:58.940 --> 1:50:01.500
 because he's seen it all and he's seen all the tricks,

1:50:01.500 --> 1:50:02.900
 you know, and so live, you know,

1:50:02.900 --> 1:50:04.460
 he probably could spot a few things.

1:50:04.460 --> 1:50:07.500
 But online, there's various ways people can try to cheat,

1:50:07.500 --> 1:50:12.500
 but there's also really good security measures in place

1:50:12.700 --> 1:50:14.380
 to catch them, you know?

1:50:14.380 --> 1:50:16.660
 And we've caught, you know, like about two years ago,

1:50:16.660 --> 1:50:20.420
 there was a huge undertaking of like 500 accounts

1:50:20.420 --> 1:50:22.700
 that were banned for doing different things.

1:50:22.700 --> 1:50:24.980
 And, you know, there's, and again, you can't go in,

1:50:24.980 --> 1:50:27.840
 they can't go into detail in terms of how they're doing it.

1:50:27.840 --> 1:50:29.940
 Cause otherwise, you know, then you're sort of giving

1:50:29.940 --> 1:50:32.580
 the cheats the playbook in terms of how to take advantage.

1:50:32.580 --> 1:50:34.580
 But it's always gonna be a concern for poker

1:50:34.580 --> 1:50:36.660
 wherever you play, right?

1:50:37.920 --> 1:50:40.340
 But it's not something I'm worried about personally.

1:50:40.340 --> 1:50:42.460
 So at the highest in person, and by the way,

1:50:42.460 --> 1:50:44.500
 online there's really interesting algorithms

1:50:44.500 --> 1:50:46.660
 that do some of the work in an automated way

1:50:46.660 --> 1:50:50.060
 to detect, to flag things that are weird.

1:50:50.060 --> 1:50:52.660
 But in person, it's just not something at the highest level

1:50:52.660 --> 1:50:54.220
 that you're super concerned about.

1:50:54.220 --> 1:50:58.100
 So it's not, it didn't quite infiltrate the poker world

1:50:58.100 --> 1:51:00.020
 to a degree where it's a huge concern.

1:51:00.020 --> 1:51:01.740
 Yeah, like, so here's the thing.

1:51:01.740 --> 1:51:04.020
 I don't play in private games and whatever, right?

1:51:04.020 --> 1:51:06.200
 But in private games, theoretically, you know,

1:51:06.200 --> 1:51:07.820
 you could be in, if you don't trust the people

1:51:07.820 --> 1:51:09.900
 you're playing with, like I've heard stories of people

1:51:09.900 --> 1:51:11.700
 where, you know, they have an earpiece in

1:51:11.700 --> 1:51:13.380
 that you can't see, right?

1:51:13.380 --> 1:51:17.140
 And they have, you know, like RFID on the cards

1:51:17.140 --> 1:51:19.860
 or something like that, and they have a phone reading it.

1:51:19.860 --> 1:51:21.460
 So they have somebody in a truck telling them,

1:51:21.460 --> 1:51:23.060
 you're gonna win this hand, you're gonna lose this hand.

1:51:23.060 --> 1:51:24.860
 Like that happened in a private game.

1:51:24.860 --> 1:51:26.700
 You know, and the guy, what's often funny

1:51:26.700 --> 1:51:30.120
 about some of these people who cheat is they're so greedy

1:51:30.120 --> 1:51:32.420
 and blatantly obvious that they get caught.

1:51:32.420 --> 1:51:35.120
 Where if they use this tool in a more subtle way,

1:51:35.120 --> 1:51:37.320
 they could probably continue to get away with it.

1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:39.620
 But again, that's not something I worry about

1:51:39.620 --> 1:51:42.740
 in a casino environment, you know, in these tournaments

1:51:42.740 --> 1:51:43.860
 and things like that.

1:51:43.860 --> 1:51:45.820
 But if I was playing in private games,

1:51:45.820 --> 1:51:48.180
 like if I came down to Texas and some guy,

1:51:48.180 --> 1:51:51.560
 I got cheated in a game by a guy named Blackie Blackburn

1:51:51.560 --> 1:51:55.460
 and Tex, I was at the Chimo Hotel, I was a teenager

1:51:55.460 --> 1:51:56.740
 and they saw me playing, you know,

1:51:56.740 --> 1:51:58.420
 I was making good money as a teenager.

1:51:58.420 --> 1:52:00.820
 I had like a $13,000 bankroll, you know,

1:52:00.820 --> 1:52:02.060
 and I went and played in this game with them

1:52:02.060 --> 1:52:04.220
 in a private hotel room and found out later

1:52:04.220 --> 1:52:06.620
 that the guy was a card mechanic, you know,

1:52:06.620 --> 1:52:08.860
 he was dealing and he could, you know, deal you the hands

1:52:08.860 --> 1:52:10.700
 and he knew what you had and stuff like that.

1:52:10.700 --> 1:52:12.140
 So yeah, I remember, you know,

1:52:12.140 --> 1:52:14.500
 I lost a big number in that game

1:52:14.500 --> 1:52:16.980
 and it was a good learning lesson in terms of, you know,

1:52:16.980 --> 1:52:18.380
 being wary of who you trust.

1:52:18.380 --> 1:52:22.120
 Yeah, so if the dealer is in on it,

1:52:22.120 --> 1:52:23.840
 that's one way you could cheat.

1:52:23.840 --> 1:52:25.440
 It's fascinating.

1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:27.440
 That's part of the reason that they cut.

1:52:27.440 --> 1:52:30.800
 So like, you'll see like, there's a burn card

1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:32.120
 because what would happen in, you know,

1:52:32.120 --> 1:52:33.680
 maybe in the old days is like,

1:52:33.680 --> 1:52:34.700
 if you're sitting in the one seat,

1:52:34.700 --> 1:52:36.440
 I could lift the card and you could see it,

1:52:36.440 --> 1:52:38.080
 the next card coming, right?

1:52:38.080 --> 1:52:40.040
 So what they do is they have a card on top of it

1:52:40.040 --> 1:52:41.200
 that you burn that isn't the card

1:52:41.200 --> 1:52:44.020
 and then the next card is the one that comes face up.

1:52:44.020 --> 1:52:48.640
 I just learned about the edge sorting thing

1:52:48.640 --> 1:52:52.040
 that Phil Ivey and maybe others were involved with.

1:52:52.040 --> 1:52:55.680
 I just, reading it at first was super interesting to me

1:52:55.680 --> 1:52:59.520
 that you can exploit the imperfections

1:52:59.520 --> 1:53:01.560
 in the printing of cards.

1:53:01.560 --> 1:53:02.840
 That was almost cool to me.

1:53:02.840 --> 1:53:05.840
 That's almost not cheating because it's like.

1:53:05.840 --> 1:53:07.280
 That needs to be a movie.

1:53:07.280 --> 1:53:08.760
 That needs to be a movie, yes.

1:53:08.760 --> 1:53:10.760
 Yeah, what happened with Phil Ivey in that whole case

1:53:10.760 --> 1:53:12.900
 is it's a catastrophe, really.

1:53:12.900 --> 1:53:14.840
 It is such a horrible precedent.

1:53:14.840 --> 1:53:15.780
 Cause here's what he did.

1:53:15.780 --> 1:53:17.300
 Phil Ivey shows up at the casino says,

1:53:17.300 --> 1:53:18.160
 I want to play this game.

1:53:18.160 --> 1:53:20.600
 They say, okay, all right, I want to play with those decks.

1:53:20.600 --> 1:53:24.040
 They say, okay, they agree to everything that he says.

1:53:24.040 --> 1:53:25.400
 He never touches the cards.

1:53:25.400 --> 1:53:28.200
 He doesn't do anything outside of the fact

1:53:28.200 --> 1:53:30.360
 that your cards that you supplied

1:53:30.360 --> 1:53:33.040
 have imperfections on them and he can see them.

1:53:33.040 --> 1:53:35.680
 Okay, so that increases his chances of winning.

1:53:35.680 --> 1:53:38.040
 He could still lose theoretically, right?

1:53:38.040 --> 1:53:39.860
 Probably not, but he can lose.

1:53:39.860 --> 1:53:41.800
 In theory, it just gives him a little bit of an edge

1:53:41.800 --> 1:53:44.200
 and it's all stuff based on what you provided.

1:53:44.200 --> 1:53:45.040
 Yeah.

1:53:45.040 --> 1:53:48.400
 So the idea that you offered a game, I accepted, I beat you

1:53:48.400 --> 1:53:50.280
 and now you want to free roll me?

1:53:50.280 --> 1:53:51.680
 That's disgusting.

1:53:51.680 --> 1:53:53.800
 So for people who don't know, maybe you can elaborate

1:53:53.800 --> 1:53:55.160
 and it's just fascinating to me,

1:53:55.160 --> 1:53:57.280
 but you're exploiting the imperfections

1:53:57.280 --> 1:53:59.440
 in the card patterns on the back

1:53:59.440 --> 1:54:01.760
 and then they look different if you rotate it.

1:54:01.760 --> 1:54:04.840
 And the fascinating thing too, when you shuffle,

1:54:04.840 --> 1:54:06.940
 usually you don't rotate the cards

1:54:06.940 --> 1:54:11.440
 so that you can see the sort of

1:54:11.440 --> 1:54:15.800
 detect which cards are the strong cards by marking them

1:54:15.800 --> 1:54:17.800
 by through rotating them.

1:54:17.800 --> 1:54:19.240
 And the way you know they're rotated

1:54:19.240 --> 1:54:21.480
 is because of the pattern imperfections.

1:54:21.480 --> 1:54:23.280
 Yeah, so some of the cards, like you said,

1:54:23.280 --> 1:54:26.040
 like they had that pattern on it

1:54:26.040 --> 1:54:28.400
 and some of them, this was faulty cards on there,

1:54:28.400 --> 1:54:29.680
 were not cut properly.

1:54:29.680 --> 1:54:33.860
 So like the eights and nines had the card cut differently

1:54:33.860 --> 1:54:35.600
 and those are important cards in this game,

1:54:35.600 --> 1:54:36.780
 the eights and nines or whatever.

1:54:36.780 --> 1:54:37.620
 So you could essentially,

1:54:37.620 --> 1:54:39.280
 from looking at the back of the card,

1:54:39.280 --> 1:54:41.800
 discern what it's gonna be.

1:54:41.800 --> 1:54:45.000
 You do nothing in terms of like cheating yourself.

1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:45.840
 You're not rigging the game.

1:54:45.840 --> 1:54:47.400
 All you're doing is taking advantage of the fact

1:54:47.400 --> 1:54:49.600
 that you're playing, you've offered me cards

1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:51.280
 that are faulty.

1:54:51.280 --> 1:54:54.200
 Can I just say that, of course, it would be Phil Ivey,

1:54:54.200 --> 1:54:56.800
 who's the goat at the normal game

1:54:56.800 --> 1:54:58.840
 who will figure out this particular thing.

1:54:58.840 --> 1:55:00.600
 I mean, that's what, if you're into soccer,

1:55:00.600 --> 1:55:03.840
 this Diego Maradona has that famous hand of God

1:55:03.840 --> 1:55:07.200
 in the World Cup where he scores a goal with his hand.

1:55:07.200 --> 1:55:10.080
 And so, of course, the referee didn't see it.

1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:11.320
 They thought it was a header.

1:55:11.320 --> 1:55:14.340
 So, I mean, part of the magic of the genius

1:55:14.340 --> 1:55:15.540
 of the people at the top of the game

1:55:15.540 --> 1:55:20.560
 is they're able to exploit all the flaws that are there.

1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:21.400
 That's a beautiful thing to see.

1:55:21.400 --> 1:55:24.200
 Well, see, Phil had, in his heyday,

1:55:24.200 --> 1:55:28.240
 he had, he exploited weaknesses in casinos,

1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:31.000
 systems all over the country.

1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:33.000
 Like in one night, I don't know if you know this story.

1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:35.600
 In one night, he would take a plane, a private plane,

1:55:35.600 --> 1:55:38.720
 and fly to 30 different casinos all over the country.

1:55:38.720 --> 1:55:40.160
 Cause he would have these deals where they're like,

1:55:40.160 --> 1:55:41.720
 all right, we've got this big rich sucker

1:55:41.720 --> 1:55:43.080
 who's gonna come here and play craps

1:55:43.080 --> 1:55:44.200
 and he's gonna lose all our money.

1:55:44.200 --> 1:55:46.000
 So he'd have this deal with one of the casinos

1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:47.520
 where they'd be like, all right,

1:55:47.520 --> 1:55:50.520
 you get 20% back up to half a million, right?

1:55:50.520 --> 1:55:53.480
 So if you lose half a million, we'll give you back 100K.

1:55:53.480 --> 1:55:56.200
 So he'd go to one casino in Tunica,

1:55:56.200 --> 1:56:00.920
 he'd play half a million, win, win or lose, he would leave.

1:56:00.920 --> 1:56:02.400
 They think they're gonna get him to stay,

1:56:02.400 --> 1:56:04.000
 they get him a big room or whatever.

1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.880
 So let's say he goes to Tunica, he loses half a million.

1:56:06.880 --> 1:56:08.760
 Now he goes, he flies to Atlantic city,

1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:10.160
 he wins half a million.

1:56:10.160 --> 1:56:12.520
 He lost half a million and won half a million,

1:56:12.520 --> 1:56:14.200
 but he got 100,000 back.

1:56:14.200 --> 1:56:16.440
 So he's actually plus 100,000.

1:56:16.440 --> 1:56:17.920
 Do that at 10 casinos a night,

1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:19.880
 you're making a million dollars in free equity.

1:56:19.880 --> 1:56:21.480
 And they would give him promotional chips

1:56:21.480 --> 1:56:23.320
 and all these kinds of things and free flights

1:56:23.320 --> 1:56:24.200
 and stuff like that.

1:56:24.200 --> 1:56:26.280
 So he took advantage of the image

1:56:26.280 --> 1:56:27.240
 that they're trying to exploit.

1:56:27.240 --> 1:56:29.680
 So this is why I don't have any empathy for these casinos.

1:56:29.680 --> 1:56:31.480
 Cause they're giving you free drinks,

1:56:31.480 --> 1:56:33.400
 they're giving you, why do you think they're doing that?

1:56:33.400 --> 1:56:34.720
 The kindness of their heart.

1:56:34.720 --> 1:56:36.160
 They're trying to exploit you.

1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:37.080
 So guess what?

1:56:37.080 --> 1:56:39.640
 You lost at your own game, pay the piper.

1:56:39.640 --> 1:56:40.640
 And I think it was crazy.

1:56:40.640 --> 1:56:43.120
 Cause the judges in his case said,

1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:47.480
 he did not cheat, but yeah, it's probably not right.

1:56:47.480 --> 1:56:48.360
 Hold on.

1:56:48.360 --> 1:56:50.360
 You just said he didn't cheat.

1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:52.520
 That should be the end of the case.

1:56:52.520 --> 1:56:54.600
 And then the casinos do the funny thing.

1:56:54.600 --> 1:56:56.200
 I mentioned to you, I was just at the UFC

1:56:56.200 --> 1:56:59.960
 and Dana White is a huge gambler.

1:56:59.960 --> 1:57:01.540
 She's a blackjack gambler.

1:57:01.540 --> 1:57:04.280
 And there's that famous situation

1:57:04.280 --> 1:57:05.800
 where you got kicked out of a casino

1:57:05.800 --> 1:57:07.040
 and the casinos do that kind of thing

1:57:07.040 --> 1:57:08.520
 when you win too much.

1:57:08.520 --> 1:57:10.920
 So he won some ridiculous amount of money.

1:57:10.920 --> 1:57:15.040
 He bets like, I mean, he plays like millions of dollars

1:57:15.040 --> 1:57:16.640
 on hands of blackjack, it's insane.

1:57:16.640 --> 1:57:19.440
 And so he won really big and he got kicked out.

1:57:19.440 --> 1:57:20.520
 Was he counting?

1:57:20.520 --> 1:57:21.640
 No, no, he wasn't counting.

1:57:21.640 --> 1:57:23.680
 So counting in blackjack here in Las Vegas

1:57:23.680 --> 1:57:25.460
 is like the only game where they actually

1:57:25.460 --> 1:57:26.860
 can ask you not to play.

1:57:26.860 --> 1:57:28.880
 So like basically if you're counting cards, right?

1:57:28.880 --> 1:57:30.400
 You could potentially have an edge in blackjack

1:57:30.400 --> 1:57:31.920
 and there are some professionals who do that,

1:57:31.920 --> 1:57:33.520
 but they get caught pretty quickly.

1:57:33.520 --> 1:57:34.720
 And then they say, you can play craps,

1:57:34.720 --> 1:57:35.560
 you can play whatever you want,

1:57:35.560 --> 1:57:36.800
 but you can't play blackjack here anymore.

1:57:36.800 --> 1:57:38.960
 No, I think, I don't think Dana White is counting.

1:57:38.960 --> 1:57:40.240
 I think he was winning a lot.

1:57:40.240 --> 1:57:43.640
 I guess they can claim that they believe you're counting

1:57:43.640 --> 1:57:45.040
 because how do you really know if you're counting?

1:57:45.040 --> 1:57:47.120
 Well, they easily, they figure it out.

1:57:47.120 --> 1:57:48.280
 So basically they have an eye in the sky

1:57:48.280 --> 1:57:51.000
 and they can see, so if you're varying your bet size, right?

1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:52.800
 So there are certain spots where based on the cards

1:57:52.800 --> 1:57:54.640
 that are out, let's say for example,

1:57:55.920 --> 1:57:57.640
 a lot of the twos, threes and fours and fives

1:57:57.640 --> 1:57:58.680
 have been coming out.

1:57:58.680 --> 1:58:01.720
 So the deck is rich in face cards.

1:58:01.720 --> 1:58:03.580
 That's very good for the player, right?

1:58:03.580 --> 1:58:06.840
 So imagine you were betting 500 bucks

1:58:06.840 --> 1:58:09.980
 and then all of a sudden you up your bet to 2000 or 5,000

1:58:09.980 --> 1:58:11.080
 when the deck is rich.

1:58:11.080 --> 1:58:12.940
 They know when the deck is rich in high cards

1:58:12.940 --> 1:58:14.720
 because they keep a counter themselves.

1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:17.280
 So if they notice a player increasing their bet sizes

1:58:17.280 --> 1:58:20.240
 when the deck is good for them, it's a telltale sign.

1:58:20.240 --> 1:58:22.640
 Interesting, I don't think Dana White would be counting.

1:58:22.640 --> 1:58:24.440
 And so casinos don't kick you out

1:58:24.440 --> 1:58:26.160
 if you don't often kick you out.

1:58:26.160 --> 1:58:28.760
 Do they ever kick you out if you make too much money?

1:58:28.760 --> 1:58:30.640
 Because you're playing millions of dollars that they.

1:58:30.640 --> 1:58:32.280
 Unless they, they would never kick you out

1:58:32.280 --> 1:58:34.360
 for making too much money, unless they suspect cheating.

1:58:34.360 --> 1:58:35.280
 Because why would they?

1:58:35.280 --> 1:58:37.480
 They have an advantage, they want the money back.

1:58:37.480 --> 1:58:38.640
 It's not like you go in there, win 10 million,

1:58:38.640 --> 1:58:40.120
 you're like, oh no, that's enough for us.

1:58:40.120 --> 1:58:42.000
 What about if he was talking shit the whole time?

1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:42.840
 I wonder.

1:58:42.840 --> 1:58:44.920
 I don't think that would matter.

1:58:44.920 --> 1:58:48.100
 Because in the long run, they'll get the money back.

1:58:48.100 --> 1:58:48.940
 Exactly.

1:58:51.360 --> 1:58:54.600
 You tweeted, if you watched Jersey Shore,

1:58:54.600 --> 1:58:57.400
 Family Vacation, we would probably get along really well.

1:58:57.400 --> 1:58:59.880
 What is it about, because I lived in Jersey for a while,

1:58:59.880 --> 1:59:03.360
 what is it about Jersey Shore characters that you love?

1:59:03.360 --> 1:59:06.560
 I just love that they're sort of, I love the debauchery.

1:59:06.560 --> 1:59:08.880
 I think Pauly D's a fun guy, you know,

1:59:08.880 --> 1:59:11.040
 and just like, it's just something like,

1:59:11.040 --> 1:59:13.560
 it's just, it's what do you call it?

1:59:13.560 --> 1:59:15.680
 It's trash TV, it's a guilty pleasure.

1:59:15.680 --> 1:59:17.520
 But you can just watch the Snooki get drunk

1:59:17.520 --> 1:59:20.240
 and fallen all over herself or whatever.

1:59:20.240 --> 1:59:23.400
 Is that part, do you love that part of Vegas as well?

1:59:23.400 --> 1:59:25.280
 Not really, I don't go out and stuff,

1:59:25.280 --> 1:59:27.020
 but I just like the characters.

1:59:27.020 --> 1:59:30.080
 I like that they have unique personalities.

1:59:30.080 --> 1:59:32.440
 And I think we live in a world now

1:59:32.440 --> 1:59:36.560
 where people are more and more careful of what they say

1:59:36.560 --> 1:59:38.440
 and afraid of backlash and all that stuff.

1:59:38.440 --> 1:59:41.560
 And it's kind of like an old school version of just like,

1:59:41.560 --> 1:59:43.240
 say what you feel, it's okay,

1:59:43.240 --> 1:59:44.920
 as long as your intent is good.

1:59:44.920 --> 1:59:49.920
 And they haven't been canceled, if you will, which is good,

1:59:49.920 --> 1:59:53.960
 but I feel like their type of behavior slowly but surely,

1:59:53.960 --> 1:59:56.120
 like, cause they got a lot of flack originally

1:59:56.120 --> 1:59:59.800
 for misrepresenting like Italian Americans

1:59:59.800 --> 2:00:00.640
 or something like that.

2:00:00.640 --> 2:00:02.160
 Like there was a lot of backlash about this

2:00:02.160 --> 2:00:04.960
 and how Italian Americans really are and blah, blah, blah.

2:00:04.960 --> 2:00:08.740
 So they sort of were representing that group of people

2:00:08.740 --> 2:00:12.060
 and, you know, they received some backlash back in the day.

2:00:13.160 --> 2:00:15.800
 I'm a huge supporter of diversity

2:00:15.800 --> 2:00:19.120
 in all the beautiful forms that the human species

2:00:19.120 --> 2:00:20.000
 is able to generate.

2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:22.020
 And that's certainly one dimension.

2:00:22.020 --> 2:00:25.180
 What's the greatest Vegas movie, would you say?

2:00:25.180 --> 2:00:26.500
 I don't know if that's a difficult question,

2:00:26.500 --> 2:00:28.680
 but Fear of Loathing in Las Vegas,

2:00:28.680 --> 2:00:30.520
 Leaving Las Vegas, Casino.

2:00:30.520 --> 2:00:32.540
 I watch, cause anytime Casino's on randomly,

2:00:32.540 --> 2:00:33.720
 I always watch it.

2:00:33.720 --> 2:00:34.960
 Such a great movie.

2:00:35.800 --> 2:00:38.040
 It could be one of the Sharon Stone.

2:00:38.040 --> 2:00:41.320
 Sharon, frankly, Sharon Stone reminded me,

2:00:41.320 --> 2:00:42.160
 every time I would watch the movie,

2:00:42.160 --> 2:00:45.600
 it reminded me of my wife, Amanda, like totally.

2:00:45.600 --> 2:00:47.340
 I would see like the character and I was like,

2:00:47.340 --> 2:00:49.440
 I'm the Robert De Niro character in the film.

2:00:49.440 --> 2:00:52.960
 It was, I used to watch it through that lens, you know.

2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:57.320
 From like the depth of love that you have.

2:00:57.320 --> 2:01:00.020
 Just kind of, she was, I remember that she was like,

2:01:00.020 --> 2:01:01.900
 she was like, she lit up every room.

2:01:01.900 --> 2:01:03.080
 She does light up every room.

2:01:03.080 --> 2:01:05.600
 She goes there, everybody's attracted and drawn to her.

2:01:05.600 --> 2:01:07.220
 And she was kind of, when she was younger,

2:01:07.220 --> 2:01:09.240
 she was a little wild and crazy and whatnot.

2:01:09.240 --> 2:01:11.680
 So she reminded me of the Sharon Stone character.

2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:13.920
 And then the Robert De Niro character is trying to like

2:01:13.920 --> 2:01:16.040
 have a stable life, you know, and be that.

2:01:16.040 --> 2:01:17.400
 And that was me.

2:01:17.400 --> 2:01:19.000
 Who was the Joe Pesci in your life?

2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:19.840
 Well, there was a guy named,

2:01:19.840 --> 2:01:22.520
 there was a James Woods for sure, who was the Lester.

2:01:22.520 --> 2:01:24.800
 We called him, we actually called him Lester.

2:01:24.800 --> 2:01:26.600
 A few of my friends call him Lester.

2:01:27.640 --> 2:01:31.360
 The greasy guy who tried to get back in and all that.

2:01:31.360 --> 2:01:32.200
 But yeah.

2:01:32.200 --> 2:01:33.040
 Yeah, one of my favorite scenes

2:01:33.040 --> 2:01:35.240
 is when they meet out in the desert

2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:36.600
 and it's like a 50, 50 odds

2:01:36.600 --> 2:01:38.360
 if you're gonna make it out alive in that.

2:01:38.360 --> 2:01:43.360
 I mean, yeah, there's an epicness to that portrayal of Vegas.

2:01:43.400 --> 2:01:45.400
 I love, I mean, it's just totally,

2:01:45.400 --> 2:01:46.760
 I mean, it's obviously more corporate now

2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:49.440
 and it's different, but I love those movies.

2:01:49.440 --> 2:01:51.440
 I love all those movies, just seeing that life.

2:01:51.440 --> 2:01:53.080
 And like I said, if there was a period in time

2:01:53.080 --> 2:01:55.360
 that I could go back to and just experience it,

2:01:55.360 --> 2:01:56.760
 it would be that, you know, right around then.

2:01:56.760 --> 2:02:00.180
 There'll be that, playing with a mob and not.

2:02:00.180 --> 2:02:01.960
 I think of like these crime shows today,

2:02:01.960 --> 2:02:04.000
 like they're so unrealistic now

2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:06.620
 because if they're in an era that is now,

2:02:06.620 --> 2:02:08.240
 like none of this stuff can happen

2:02:08.240 --> 2:02:09.660
 because there's cameras everywhere.

2:02:09.660 --> 2:02:11.000
 You can't like get away with these,

2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:13.640
 like killing somebody and jumping in a car

2:02:13.640 --> 2:02:15.840
 and you're gonna get caught, you know?

2:02:15.840 --> 2:02:18.200
 But in the 70s, you know, that stuff happened.

2:02:18.200 --> 2:02:19.600
 Across the line, you die.

2:02:19.600 --> 2:02:22.800
 Yeah, Lake Mead is recently like losing water

2:02:22.800 --> 2:02:24.240
 and like every couple of days

2:02:24.240 --> 2:02:26.720
 they're finding more and more bodies from that era.

2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:27.560
 Oh no.

2:02:27.560 --> 2:02:28.400
 They really are.

2:02:29.280 --> 2:02:30.840
 You're close with your mom.

2:02:30.840 --> 2:02:33.280
 What did you learn about life from your mom?

2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:35.000
 My mother was very generous.

2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:39.920
 My mother, she experienced joy through giving people food.

2:02:39.920 --> 2:02:42.080
 For the most part, my dad would get them drinks

2:02:42.080 --> 2:02:45.600
 and that was how she felt fulfilled, right?

2:02:45.600 --> 2:02:47.440
 She felt good when she like would cook for you.

2:02:47.440 --> 2:02:49.400
 And like, she'd be that person you'd come over

2:02:49.400 --> 2:02:50.760
 and she'd be like, are you hungry?

2:02:50.760 --> 2:02:51.960
 And you say, no, no, no, I'm okay.

2:02:51.960 --> 2:02:54.760
 She's gonna put 15 things in front of you and you'll eat.

2:02:54.760 --> 2:02:55.600
 You know, you're gonna eat.

2:02:55.600 --> 2:02:56.840
 Cause everyone does that to be polite.

2:02:56.840 --> 2:02:57.760
 No, no, I'm good.

2:02:57.760 --> 2:02:59.520
 But you know, they will start to eat.

2:02:59.520 --> 2:03:01.520
 And just her hospitality in that regard

2:03:01.520 --> 2:03:04.440
 and just being generous and like being a good host

2:03:04.440 --> 2:03:06.320
 to people and things like that, like.

2:03:07.520 --> 2:03:10.560
 How did that define, like help define who you are

2:03:10.560 --> 2:03:13.040
 as a person, that generosity?

2:03:13.040 --> 2:03:14.520
 Did it rub off on you?

2:03:14.520 --> 2:03:17.440
 It made me think about in my life

2:03:17.440 --> 2:03:21.520
 when it comes to like any sort of business deals

2:03:21.520 --> 2:03:23.920
 or things like that, I don't wanna get the best of it

2:03:23.920 --> 2:03:25.600
 in such a way where I screw the other person.

2:03:25.600 --> 2:03:26.920
 I genuinely don't.

2:03:26.920 --> 2:03:29.400
 I'd much rather you owe me than me owe you.

2:03:29.400 --> 2:03:32.160
 So if I hire people, they get paid more

2:03:32.160 --> 2:03:33.160
 than they're supposed to.

2:03:33.160 --> 2:03:36.040
 And I'd rather them do that and work towards it

2:03:36.040 --> 2:03:37.200
 rather than feel underpaid.

2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:39.480
 Cause if they're underpaid, they'll likely under deliver.

2:03:39.480 --> 2:03:41.160
 Whereas if they feel overpaid,

2:03:41.160 --> 2:03:43.280
 then if I need them to do something special,

2:03:43.280 --> 2:03:45.240
 they're not gonna be like, hey, I don't get paid for that.

2:03:45.240 --> 2:03:46.720
 Like, yeah, you do.

2:03:46.720 --> 2:03:47.560
 You really do.

2:03:47.560 --> 2:03:49.840
 So that's certainly like played out in my life

2:03:49.840 --> 2:03:53.080
 where I set it up in such a way where I don't owe,

2:03:53.080 --> 2:03:56.080
 you know, I'm owed, but that's okay.

2:03:56.080 --> 2:03:58.600
 Cause I can handle taking the worst of it in spots.

2:03:58.600 --> 2:04:01.840
 I don't like being the person to, you know,

2:04:01.840 --> 2:04:03.440
 feel like I'm indebted to others.

2:04:04.320 --> 2:04:06.840
 Yeah, in some way, the karma of that tends

2:04:06.840 --> 2:04:09.360
 to pay dividends in the longterm.

2:04:09.360 --> 2:04:14.360
 Somehow there's somebody up there

2:04:15.080 --> 2:04:17.560
 that's keeping track in some kind of way.

2:04:17.560 --> 2:04:20.440
 What advice would you give to young people today

2:04:20.440 --> 2:04:22.240
 in high school and college?

2:04:22.240 --> 2:04:25.200
 How to have a career they can be proud of

2:04:25.200 --> 2:04:27.300
 or maybe how to have a life in general

2:04:27.300 --> 2:04:28.900
 they can be proud of?

2:04:28.900 --> 2:04:32.080
 I would say like your 20s is a good opportunity

2:04:32.080 --> 2:04:34.880
 to set yourself up for the rest of your life, right?

2:04:34.880 --> 2:04:38.140
 So while the 20s are a period where you wanna have fun

2:04:38.140 --> 2:04:40.440
 and you wanna experience youth,

2:04:40.440 --> 2:04:42.400
 it's also a good opportunity to start thinking about

2:04:42.400 --> 2:04:44.840
 what do you want your life to look like

2:04:44.840 --> 2:04:46.840
 in your 30s and your 40s, right?

2:04:46.840 --> 2:04:48.660
 So I feel like it's the best time

2:04:48.660 --> 2:04:51.200
 to really put yourself out there and take risks

2:04:51.200 --> 2:04:53.760
 and try to hit it, you know, whatever,

2:04:53.760 --> 2:04:55.380
 you know, like to work really, really hard

2:04:55.380 --> 2:04:56.400
 to set yourself up.

2:04:56.400 --> 2:04:59.880
 Because, and I said this at an event I was speaking at,

2:04:59.880 --> 2:05:01.040
 when you're like with poker,

2:05:01.040 --> 2:05:02.480
 when your bankroll is very, very small,

2:05:02.480 --> 2:05:05.120
 it's replenishable, right?

2:05:05.120 --> 2:05:06.960
 You don't need to protect it as much

2:05:06.960 --> 2:05:09.360
 as you do once you've got something, right?

2:05:09.360 --> 2:05:11.200
 Once you have a brand or you have money,

2:05:11.200 --> 2:05:12.560
 you have something like that,

2:05:12.560 --> 2:05:14.040
 that's when you wanna start protecting you.

2:05:14.040 --> 2:05:15.580
 But in your 20s is an opportunity

2:05:15.580 --> 2:05:18.120
 to just really sort of get, you know,

2:05:18.120 --> 2:05:21.260
 to work really, really hard to set yourself up,

2:05:21.260 --> 2:05:22.100
 you know, for the future.

2:05:22.100 --> 2:05:23.280
 I am concerned a little bit,

2:05:23.280 --> 2:05:24.600
 like every time I talk to kids today,

2:05:24.600 --> 2:05:26.080
 I'm like, what do you wanna be?

2:05:26.080 --> 2:05:30.160
 They all wanna be YouTubers or Instagram stars or rappers,

2:05:30.160 --> 2:05:31.000
 right?

2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:32.480
 Like, okay, I was like, that's cool,

2:05:32.480 --> 2:05:33.880
 but like, there's only so many of those,

2:05:33.880 --> 2:05:35.360
 you know, that there can be.

2:05:35.360 --> 2:05:36.520
 So it might be worthwhile having

2:05:36.520 --> 2:05:38.000
 a little bit of a backup plan.

2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:40.600
 I think it's easier to be successful on Instagram

2:05:40.600 --> 2:05:43.160
 and social media if you do something else.

2:05:43.160 --> 2:05:44.680
 And I would say this too.

2:05:44.680 --> 2:05:46.960
 One other thing I would say is,

2:05:46.960 --> 2:05:49.640
 don't choose a profession or an idea

2:05:50.640 --> 2:05:54.000
 because you think it'll make you rich, right?

2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:56.560
 Pursue something that you actually love.

2:05:56.560 --> 2:05:57.700
 Because if you love it,

2:05:57.700 --> 2:05:59.560
 you're way more likely to become rich.

2:05:59.560 --> 2:06:02.960
 If you don't, you do something that you don't actually enjoy.

2:06:02.960 --> 2:06:05.440
 Now you're spending a lot of your life unhappy,

2:06:05.440 --> 2:06:06.680
 doing something you don't want,

2:06:06.680 --> 2:06:08.760
 and if you're not passionate about it,

2:06:08.760 --> 2:06:09.600
 you're probably not,

2:06:09.600 --> 2:06:12.240
 the chances of you being successful are much lower.

2:06:12.240 --> 2:06:14.000
 And also becoming rich,

2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:15.760
 and I've talked to a lot of rich people,

2:06:15.760 --> 2:06:17.400
 hang out with a lot of rich people,

2:06:17.400 --> 2:06:21.440
 is not going to be as fulfilling as you imagine.

2:06:21.440 --> 2:06:23.600
 If you arrive there by not doing the thing

2:06:23.600 --> 2:06:24.720
 that you love doing.

2:06:24.720 --> 2:06:25.560
 That's true.

2:06:25.560 --> 2:06:28.800
 Ultimately, the thing that you love doing is like,

2:06:28.800 --> 2:06:30.320
 that's what makes life worth it.

2:06:30.320 --> 2:06:32.240
 There's another quote, I can't remember who it was,

2:06:32.240 --> 2:06:33.080
 otherwise I would quote them,

2:06:33.080 --> 2:06:35.480
 but it says something to the effect of like,

2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:39.640
 if we believe in the lie that more is always better,

2:06:39.640 --> 2:06:41.640
 then we can never truly arrive.

2:06:41.640 --> 2:06:44.480
 Because wherever we are, more is better, right?

2:06:44.480 --> 2:06:45.640
 I've never understood,

2:06:45.640 --> 2:06:46.680
 and I've been around rich people,

2:06:46.680 --> 2:06:48.320
 like you said, you know, the bill,

2:06:48.320 --> 2:06:50.320
 I never got, I can't, I don't get it.

2:06:50.320 --> 2:06:51.920
 Like, if you have a billion dollars,

2:06:51.920 --> 2:06:54.680
 why do you give a shit about money at all?

2:06:54.680 --> 2:06:56.680
 Like, and they're still like, oh, we made this deal,

2:06:56.680 --> 2:06:58.720
 and I'm like, you know, we picked up 300,

2:06:58.720 --> 2:06:59.560
 who cares?

2:06:59.560 --> 2:07:00.440
 Like, your life is set.

2:07:00.440 --> 2:07:03.040
 Like, there is that bell curve, right?

2:07:03.040 --> 2:07:05.200
 Where obviously being in poverty, you know,

2:07:05.200 --> 2:07:07.320
 there's obviously a high rate of unhappiness,

2:07:07.320 --> 2:07:09.600
 but there's a certain amount of money where you reach,

2:07:09.600 --> 2:07:10.960
 you know, where you reach a level of happiness,

2:07:10.960 --> 2:07:13.280
 and then too much, you find the people

2:07:13.280 --> 2:07:15.400
 that are searching for money to fulfill these holes,

2:07:15.400 --> 2:07:17.480
 it starts to go back down again.

2:07:17.480 --> 2:07:21.520
 Well, the getting more money could become a game,

2:07:21.520 --> 2:07:23.520
 like a sport, that's fun to play,

2:07:23.520 --> 2:07:27.320
 as long as you directly or indirectly acknowledge

2:07:27.320 --> 2:07:29.520
 that what you love is the game of it,

2:07:29.520 --> 2:07:31.000
 versus the actual attainment of money.

2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:32.600
 And I think that's what it is, right?

2:07:32.600 --> 2:07:34.600
 For me, I've never cared about money that much.

2:07:34.600 --> 2:07:37.280
 I just never did, otherwise I would have a lot more of it.

2:07:37.280 --> 2:07:40.040
 But it's always, like, it's always been strange to me

2:07:40.040 --> 2:07:42.160
 how people that have that kind of money,

2:07:42.160 --> 2:07:45.760
 like, are cheap in any way, you know?

2:07:45.760 --> 2:07:48.880
 Like, they wouldn't donate 5,000 to a worthwhile charity,

2:07:48.880 --> 2:07:50.560
 because it's like, buddy, this,

2:07:50.560 --> 2:07:52.720
 like, when it changes your life, not,

2:07:52.720 --> 2:07:55.440
 I don't even like, like, small things, like taxes.

2:07:55.440 --> 2:07:57.400
 Like, okay, you have $20 billion,

2:07:57.400 --> 2:08:00.640
 and you're worried about paying 33%, 30% to 31.

2:08:00.640 --> 2:08:03.480
 I get it, I get the point of it all,

2:08:03.480 --> 2:08:06.880
 but like, it literally has no effect on your life whatsoever.

2:08:06.880 --> 2:08:10.200
 Your life is unchanged, whether it's 31 or 33.

2:08:10.200 --> 2:08:12.840
 Yeah, that's the negative of a lot of money,

2:08:12.840 --> 2:08:14.800
 is if it corrupts the way you see the world,

2:08:14.800 --> 2:08:16.520
 you start to be protective and so on.

2:08:16.520 --> 2:08:19.240
 I mean, part of the challenge of when you get a lot of money

2:08:19.240 --> 2:08:21.200
 is people start to treat you differently,

2:08:21.200 --> 2:08:24.760
 and so navigating that correctly is very challenging.

2:08:24.760 --> 2:08:29.760
 So don't change, remain the same person you always were,

2:08:29.960 --> 2:08:32.000
 because if you change, you start to,

2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:33.720
 I mean, that's why power corrupts,

2:08:33.720 --> 2:08:36.000
 is you get a lot of power, you get a lot of fame,

2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:40.120
 you get a lot of money, you start to distrust people,

2:08:40.120 --> 2:08:41.840
 and you start to push away people

2:08:41.840 --> 2:08:43.680
 that are actually really close to you with trusting.

2:08:43.680 --> 2:08:45.400
 And you also, I think, you develop some biases

2:08:45.400 --> 2:08:47.040
 where you think, like, you're just this,

2:08:47.040 --> 2:08:49.360
 you know, you think, like, it was all you,

2:08:49.360 --> 2:08:51.000
 and you're a genius, and you're so great,

2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:52.440
 and all these other people who don't have,

2:08:52.440 --> 2:08:54.040
 it's just because they don't have what you have,

2:08:54.040 --> 2:08:57.080
 and then you start to view that group of people,

2:08:57.080 --> 2:09:00.280
 whether they're impoverished or whatever is less than,

2:09:00.280 --> 2:09:01.640
 and that you're some great guru

2:09:01.640 --> 2:09:04.080
 where you could have just got lucky and bought Bitcoins

2:09:04.080 --> 2:09:05.520
 that you could have done anything,

2:09:05.520 --> 2:09:07.520
 and then you became super wealthy,

2:09:07.520 --> 2:09:10.160
 and then you have this Dunning Kruger effect,

2:09:10.160 --> 2:09:11.800
 where you think you know everything about everything.

2:09:11.800 --> 2:09:13.000
 And a lot of poker people have that,

2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:16.080
 and listen, I'm probably guilty in some ways too,

2:09:16.080 --> 2:09:17.640
 thinking because you can figure out poker

2:09:17.640 --> 2:09:20.200
 and be great at that, that you could figure out anything.

2:09:20.200 --> 2:09:21.440
 So it's true, right?

2:09:21.440 --> 2:09:24.160
 I mean, we sort of, we genuinely feel like

2:09:24.160 --> 2:09:25.640
 people that reach the highest levels of poker

2:09:25.640 --> 2:09:27.200
 feel like they are intelligent.

2:09:27.200 --> 2:09:28.440
 So they will look at problem solving

2:09:28.440 --> 2:09:30.120
 and think that they have answers.

2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:32.840
 Well, you have to remind yourself that you're not.

2:09:32.840 --> 2:09:35.480
 It's best to see the world as you did just get lucky,

2:09:35.480 --> 2:09:37.080
 or at least from my perspective,

2:09:37.080 --> 2:09:38.400
 that you're not better than anybody.

2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:39.640
 I don't think there's anything wrong with, like,

2:09:39.640 --> 2:09:42.000
 acknowledging that you worked hard to get where you were.

2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:44.320
 Like, there isn't, but at the same time, like,

2:09:44.320 --> 2:09:46.160
 it's not available to everybody in the same way.

2:09:46.160 --> 2:09:47.440
 You know, right time, right place.

2:09:47.440 --> 2:09:48.600
 Like, for me, my poker career

2:09:48.600 --> 2:09:50.520
 could have gone very differently, you know?

2:09:50.520 --> 2:09:52.320
 If things didn't work out, you know,

2:09:52.320 --> 2:09:54.400
 if I had some bad luck in the wrong times,

2:09:54.400 --> 2:09:56.080
 like, who knows where I'd be?

2:09:56.080 --> 2:09:59.840
 So you said your brain crawl is pretty small in your 20s.

2:09:59.840 --> 2:10:01.840
 I'm sure you've been around a lot of people

2:10:01.840 --> 2:10:04.720
 you care a lot about who've lost everything in poker.

2:10:04.720 --> 2:10:05.960
 What's that like?

2:10:05.960 --> 2:10:09.280
 What's those low points of losing everything?

2:10:09.280 --> 2:10:12.040
 I think because I've been there,

2:10:12.040 --> 2:10:15.600
 I have more empathy than I probably should for those people.

2:10:15.600 --> 2:10:16.480
 I really feel for them.

2:10:16.480 --> 2:10:18.960
 Cause I remember being in Vegas and being totally broke

2:10:18.960 --> 2:10:21.720
 and like a guy loaning me $400

2:10:21.720 --> 2:10:24.840
 and me like turning that 400 into 20,000, 400 bucks.

2:10:24.840 --> 2:10:27.360
 And it was like eternally grateful to that.

2:10:27.360 --> 2:10:29.520
 So when I have friends who go through that,

2:10:29.520 --> 2:10:31.000
 like I always try to consult them,

2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:34.680
 obviously what they really need is money for the most part.

2:10:34.680 --> 2:10:36.440
 But I remember saying no to one friend

2:10:36.440 --> 2:10:37.720
 because he didn't have a plan.

2:10:37.720 --> 2:10:39.800
 So I like to try to help them in that regard.

2:10:39.800 --> 2:10:42.240
 Like my buddy's like, can you stake me in this game?

2:10:42.240 --> 2:10:43.880
 And I was like, all right, well, how much do you,

2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:45.720
 then I was like, let's break down the math, bro.

2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:46.560
 You want me to stake you?

2:10:46.560 --> 2:10:48.720
 So you get 50% of the profit, right?

2:10:48.720 --> 2:10:50.440
 So I said, how much do you think you can make in this game?

2:10:50.440 --> 2:10:52.200
 How much does the biggest winners make?

2:10:52.200 --> 2:10:53.640
 It's like, well, I can probably, you know,

2:10:53.640 --> 2:10:56.280
 I probably do like 20,000 a month in this game.

2:10:56.280 --> 2:10:57.120
 So, okay.

2:10:57.120 --> 2:10:58.960
 So you get half of that cause I get 10, right?

2:10:58.960 --> 2:10:59.900
 What is your monthly nut?

2:10:59.900 --> 2:11:00.740
 How much are you spending?

2:11:00.740 --> 2:11:03.400
 It's like, well, I'm renting this thing for 8,000.

2:11:03.400 --> 2:11:05.920
 You're spending 17,000 a month.

2:11:05.920 --> 2:11:09.480
 So like, no matter what you're set up to fail.

2:11:09.480 --> 2:11:10.900
 Like this isn't going to work.

2:11:10.900 --> 2:11:12.160
 So I actually didn't give him the money.

2:11:12.160 --> 2:11:13.940
 And I was like, what you need to do to earn more money

2:11:13.940 --> 2:11:16.120
 is lower your monthly nut because it's too high.

2:11:16.120 --> 2:11:19.160
 It just, you know, it just doesn't mathematically add up.

2:11:19.160 --> 2:11:21.500
 So trying to set them right in that regard

2:11:21.500 --> 2:11:24.680
 is something that like I feel obliged to do,

2:11:24.680 --> 2:11:25.520
 especially if they're friends.

2:11:25.520 --> 2:11:27.600
 But what about the mental aspect of the struggle

2:11:27.600 --> 2:11:30.040
 they're going through, the struggle you were going through?

2:11:30.040 --> 2:11:34.400
 Just, I mean, it's really rough to have no money.

2:11:34.400 --> 2:11:35.520
 It's not for everybody.

2:11:35.520 --> 2:11:36.360
 This really isn't.

2:11:36.360 --> 2:11:37.720
 Like a lot of people might, you know, listen to this

2:11:37.720 --> 2:11:38.800
 and think like, oh, I want to play poker.

2:11:38.800 --> 2:11:40.580
 It's like, most people fail.

2:11:41.520 --> 2:11:43.920
 Most people who want to play in the NFL,

2:11:43.920 --> 2:11:46.320
 they spend their college years,

2:11:46.320 --> 2:11:48.520
 like most of them are not going to make it.

2:11:48.520 --> 2:11:50.440
 Most of you who try to play poker professionally

2:11:50.440 --> 2:11:52.900
 are going to fail and you're going to experience despair.

2:11:52.900 --> 2:11:53.800
 Okay?

2:11:53.800 --> 2:11:56.160
 There are those like in anything that have the passion,

2:11:56.160 --> 2:11:58.280
 have the knowhow, have the luck and all that sort of stuff.

2:11:58.280 --> 2:12:01.640
 And it all pans out, but you know, they're the minority.

2:12:03.200 --> 2:12:06.440
 And so for the low points, if you remember,

2:12:06.440 --> 2:12:08.720
 what does it take to sort of overcome that,

2:12:08.720 --> 2:12:12.300
 overcome the mental struggle?

2:12:12.300 --> 2:12:13.800
 I mean, you're making it sound like certain people

2:12:13.800 --> 2:12:15.520
 are just genetically able to in certain.

2:12:15.520 --> 2:12:18.240
 I do think some people are more apt to being able to deal

2:12:18.240 --> 2:12:20.040
 with like adversity and having resilience

2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:21.600
 and some people just can't hack it.

2:12:21.600 --> 2:12:23.360
 But like I generally, what I would advise,

2:12:23.360 --> 2:12:24.760
 you know, people that are, let's say a guy's playing,

2:12:24.760 --> 2:12:26.480
 you know, really high stakes or whatever,

2:12:26.480 --> 2:12:29.140
 doing badly is step number one is take,

2:12:29.140 --> 2:12:30.520
 take a little bit of a break here.

2:12:30.520 --> 2:12:33.760
 Let's recalibrate and let's start small again.

2:12:33.760 --> 2:12:35.040
 Let's, you know, let's restart

2:12:35.040 --> 2:12:36.140
 and let's play smaller stakes

2:12:36.140 --> 2:12:39.120
 and let's get our confidence back because in poker,

2:12:39.120 --> 2:12:41.660
 without confidence, you cannot be successful.

2:12:41.660 --> 2:12:45.120
 It is incredibly important to have almost an inflated level

2:12:45.120 --> 2:12:46.880
 of confidence in yourself

2:12:46.880 --> 2:12:48.800
 because you're up against it, right?

2:12:48.800 --> 2:12:50.460
 As I said, the majority of people fail.

2:12:50.460 --> 2:12:51.520
 So why are you special?

2:12:51.520 --> 2:12:52.560
 Why are you different?

2:12:52.560 --> 2:12:54.240
 You have to be pretty confident about your, you know,

2:12:54.240 --> 2:12:57.560
 yourself to think that you are one of the chosen ones.

2:12:57.560 --> 2:13:01.680
 And then don't resist the despair and take a nap.

2:13:01.680 --> 2:13:03.800
 Definitely take a nap.

2:13:03.800 --> 2:13:05.080
 Listen, it's okay to experience it.

2:13:05.080 --> 2:13:06.800
 Like I said, yeah, you're going to experience despair.

2:13:06.800 --> 2:13:09.280
 What else would you, what should you be feeling?

2:13:09.280 --> 2:13:10.440
 You know, if things are going poorly

2:13:10.440 --> 2:13:12.840
 and you've just lost all your money, excited?

2:13:12.840 --> 2:13:15.880
 Maybe like, okay, have your moment of grief,

2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:18.360
 allow yourself to experience it so that you can,

2:13:18.360 --> 2:13:20.560
 you know, reassemble.

2:13:20.560 --> 2:13:21.800
 There's a fundamental way

2:13:21.800 --> 2:13:23.720
 in which you haven't really lived life

2:13:23.720 --> 2:13:27.200
 if you haven't experienced periods of despair.

2:13:27.200 --> 2:13:30.080
 You have a jaded view of the world, right?

2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:31.880
 Weird thing about the human condition

2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:35.280
 that both the highs and the lows are important.

2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:36.120
 Yeah.

2:13:36.120 --> 2:13:40.740
 What role does love play in the human condition,

2:13:40.740 --> 2:13:42.220
 Daniel Negrano?

2:13:42.220 --> 2:13:43.660
 That's a good one.

2:13:43.660 --> 2:13:47.020
 What role has love played in your life?

2:13:47.020 --> 2:13:48.700
 It's, yeah, that's, you know,

2:13:48.700 --> 2:13:50.980
 you sort of talked about the ups and downs

2:13:50.980 --> 2:13:55.980
 of the human condition and love has been that for me, right?

2:13:58.500 --> 2:14:00.520
 Like I'm in a good place now,

2:14:00.520 --> 2:14:04.580
 but you know, even with my now wife years ago,

2:14:04.580 --> 2:14:07.900
 you know, she was young, she was, you know, new to poker

2:14:07.900 --> 2:14:09.240
 and she wasn't ready to settle down.

2:14:09.240 --> 2:14:12.460
 I was like, when I met her, I think I was 31, she was 21.

2:14:12.460 --> 2:14:15.620
 And I was ready to like lock her up, if you will, you know,

2:14:15.620 --> 2:14:16.460
 let's do this.

2:14:16.460 --> 2:14:18.420
 And I bought a ring way back when she was like,

2:14:18.420 --> 2:14:19.260
 not about that.

2:14:19.260 --> 2:14:20.940
 She was living the Hollywood life.

2:14:20.940 --> 2:14:22.300
 She was living, you know, partying in LA,

2:14:22.300 --> 2:14:23.900
 doing that kind of stuff and wasn't ready.

2:14:23.900 --> 2:14:27.220
 And we split and that one hit me hard.

2:14:27.220 --> 2:14:31.120
 So I didn't realize how much of a hit

2:14:31.120 --> 2:14:35.220
 that had on my confidence in my, in everything really,

2:14:35.220 --> 2:14:36.600
 in poker, with other women.

2:14:36.600 --> 2:14:39.660
 It had me a little jaded about women too, you know,

2:14:39.660 --> 2:14:43.300
 resentful, you know, and it took a lot of like self,

2:14:43.300 --> 2:14:45.780
 I did like a lot of personal growth work

2:14:45.780 --> 2:14:47.700
 and workshops and things like that.

2:14:47.700 --> 2:14:49.860
 And then didn't see her for years.

2:14:49.860 --> 2:14:51.780
 And she came back to town, I was a much different person.

2:14:51.780 --> 2:14:54.140
 It was just, you know, four years ago or something like that.

2:14:54.140 --> 2:14:56.740
 And she was too, went to dinner.

2:14:56.740 --> 2:14:58.740
 A few months later, we were married.

2:14:58.740 --> 2:15:01.460
 It worked out so different because we both had to grow,

2:15:01.460 --> 2:15:03.700
 you know, and become different people.

2:15:03.700 --> 2:15:05.500
 And that love was still there somehow.

2:15:05.500 --> 2:15:07.540
 Yeah, like she went through her relationships.

2:15:07.540 --> 2:15:09.940
 I went through mine, you know, we experienced life

2:15:09.940 --> 2:15:12.900
 and I was married once before too, you know,

2:15:12.900 --> 2:15:14.860
 called my starter marriage, if you will,

2:15:16.020 --> 2:15:19.020
 which yeah, you know, we just, you don't know.

2:15:19.020 --> 2:15:21.180
 I think like until you do it, until you get married

2:15:21.180 --> 2:15:23.580
 and you know, experience like the sacrifice,

2:15:23.580 --> 2:15:25.760
 not necessarily the sacrifices, but your value systems,

2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:27.060
 if they don't align identically,

2:15:27.060 --> 2:15:30.220
 which they're not going to, someone like me,

2:15:30.220 --> 2:15:32.860
 probably one of my strengths in poker,

2:15:32.860 --> 2:15:36.120
 but my weaknesses in relationship is judgment, right?

2:15:36.120 --> 2:15:37.940
 When I play poker, I need to judge you.

2:15:37.940 --> 2:15:39.340
 That's essentially what I'm doing.

2:15:39.340 --> 2:15:42.020
 I'm gauging who you are and what you're good at

2:15:42.020 --> 2:15:43.180
 and what you're bad at.

2:15:43.180 --> 2:15:45.180
 And that can have repercussions because it leads,

2:15:45.180 --> 2:15:48.620
 that's how I view, that's the lens I look at everyone with

2:15:48.620 --> 2:15:49.680
 based on how you live your life.

2:15:49.680 --> 2:15:51.360
 I'm judging you, this guy's this, this guy's that,

2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:53.300
 this guy's that, and that's not healthy.

2:15:53.300 --> 2:15:54.780
 So you have to shut that off.

2:15:54.780 --> 2:15:56.740
 You have to learn to like, and the thing,

2:15:56.740 --> 2:15:59.500
 I finally realized what love is, frankly for me,

2:15:59.500 --> 2:16:02.260
 with her is no judgment, right?

2:16:02.260 --> 2:16:04.900
 She's so like, yeah, so I have my way of being, right?

2:16:04.900 --> 2:16:06.980
 If she wants to have cereal for dinner,

2:16:06.980 --> 2:16:08.580
 babe, that's the best decision for her.

2:16:08.580 --> 2:16:11.260
 I was living in a framework of better and worse.

2:16:11.260 --> 2:16:13.940
 The way that I do things is better and yours is worse,

2:16:13.940 --> 2:16:15.580
 do things more like I do.

2:16:15.580 --> 2:16:17.420
 That's a recipe for disaster.

2:16:17.420 --> 2:16:19.860
 True acceptance and true love is accepting someone

2:16:19.860 --> 2:16:21.460
 like exactly as they are.

2:16:21.460 --> 2:16:23.180
 You know, if she wants to do something different,

2:16:23.180 --> 2:16:25.060
 I'm going to support her, whatever it is.

2:16:25.060 --> 2:16:26.700
 Even if I disagree with it personally,

2:16:26.700 --> 2:16:28.600
 and like the way that I would do things,

2:16:28.600 --> 2:16:31.460
 learning to just realize that she's had a different journey

2:16:31.460 --> 2:16:34.340
 and a different walk towards where she's at than I have.

2:16:34.340 --> 2:16:37.540
 So I can't pass my judgments on other people like that.

2:16:37.540 --> 2:16:39.380
 I believe it is ethically wrong

2:16:39.380 --> 2:16:42.020
 and probably illegal to eat cereal for dinner.

2:16:43.540 --> 2:16:45.700
 Listen, if she wants it, she wants it.

2:16:45.700 --> 2:16:46.860
 Acceptance.

2:16:46.860 --> 2:16:49.100
 Like when she goes to bed, like all these little things,

2:16:49.100 --> 2:16:50.860
 but my regimented life, she's not.

2:16:50.860 --> 2:16:53.780
 Like our motto at our wedding was like,

2:16:53.780 --> 2:16:56.700
 you keep me wild, I'll keep you safe, you keep me wild.

2:16:56.700 --> 2:16:59.020
 I keep her safe, she keeps me wild.

2:16:59.020 --> 2:17:01.620
 She's like not organized and anal and all those kind

2:17:01.620 --> 2:17:02.940
 of things, I am.

2:17:02.940 --> 2:17:06.160
 She helps me like let loose.

2:17:06.160 --> 2:17:07.580
 You know, oh no, I'm eating this, this.

2:17:07.580 --> 2:17:09.020
 She's like, have some popcorn.

2:17:09.020 --> 2:17:10.700
 Like, all right, let's do it, you know?

2:17:10.700 --> 2:17:12.540
 She keeps me freed.

2:17:12.540 --> 2:17:14.780
 And accepting that, embracing that,

2:17:14.780 --> 2:17:17.720
 the difference is the chaos of it.

2:17:17.720 --> 2:17:18.560
 Yeah.

2:17:18.560 --> 2:17:19.380
 That's what makes it.

2:17:19.380 --> 2:17:21.100
 Like I literally do think about with her,

2:17:21.100 --> 2:17:25.360
 how important it is and how much I try to like just come

2:17:25.360 --> 2:17:28.260
 from neutral and like compassion and never judge.

2:17:28.260 --> 2:17:30.380
 Cause she's got other things that she deals with, right?

2:17:30.380 --> 2:17:32.940
 That I don't, she's bipolar, right?

2:17:32.940 --> 2:17:35.860
 So with that, I've studied and I've learned a lot about,

2:17:35.860 --> 2:17:37.860
 you know, sort of mental health and what that means

2:17:37.860 --> 2:17:42.860
 and ways in which a lot of characteristics

2:17:43.340 --> 2:17:45.740
 about somebody is completely out of their control

2:17:45.740 --> 2:17:47.380
 when they're bipolar, right?

2:17:47.380 --> 2:17:51.260
 And there's swings, like there's no cocktail

2:17:51.260 --> 2:17:53.820
 for bipolar that solves the issue, right?

2:17:53.820 --> 2:17:55.740
 So there's medications that work to, you know,

2:17:55.740 --> 2:17:57.660
 level you out for periods of time,

2:17:57.660 --> 2:17:59.540
 but then they start to fade and they don't work as well.

2:17:59.540 --> 2:18:01.540
 So they constantly need readjustment.

2:18:01.540 --> 2:18:04.020
 It's an unsolved mystery to a certain degree.

2:18:04.020 --> 2:18:07.220
 So in some sense, you know,

2:18:07.220 --> 2:18:11.180
 her diagnosis made our relationship easier

2:18:11.180 --> 2:18:13.540
 because I don't take anything personal, right?

2:18:13.540 --> 2:18:16.140
 I realized that sometimes she's gonna be in a mood.

2:18:16.140 --> 2:18:19.740
 I mean, she's so good about communicating it though.

2:18:19.740 --> 2:18:22.020
 She tells me some morning she'll be like bad mood

2:18:22.020 --> 2:18:22.860
 trying to get out of it, babe.

2:18:22.860 --> 2:18:24.780
 I'm like, okay, I leave her alone.

2:18:24.780 --> 2:18:25.620
 Well, that's great.

2:18:25.620 --> 2:18:27.620
 That means she's grown to be able to communicate,

2:18:27.620 --> 2:18:29.940
 to understand, to self reflect, to understand where she is.

2:18:29.940 --> 2:18:32.900
 I have people in my life who I love who are bipolar.

2:18:32.900 --> 2:18:34.060
 It's a beautiful ride.

2:18:34.060 --> 2:18:35.100
 It is, right?

2:18:35.100 --> 2:18:38.780
 Yeah, it's, yeah, the highs and the lows are there.

2:18:38.780 --> 2:18:41.540
 So, but yeah, like, because I feel like a protector.

2:18:41.540 --> 2:18:44.380
 For me, I just want to be a rock, right?

2:18:44.380 --> 2:18:45.900
 And that's part of the whole serial thing.

2:18:45.900 --> 2:18:47.780
 If she wants to eat cereal,

2:18:47.780 --> 2:18:50.540
 don't make a wrong for anything she wants to do.

2:18:50.540 --> 2:18:52.100
 What have you learned from life

2:18:52.100 --> 2:18:55.660
 from the song, The Gambler by Kenny Rogers?

2:18:55.660 --> 2:18:57.140
 You got to know when to hold them,

2:18:57.140 --> 2:18:58.700
 know when to fold them,

2:18:58.700 --> 2:19:01.540
 know when to walk away, know when to run.

2:19:01.540 --> 2:19:04.100
 You never count your money when you're sitting at the table.

2:19:04.100 --> 2:19:05.580
 There'll be plenty of time for counting

2:19:05.580 --> 2:19:06.820
 when the dealing's done.

2:19:06.820 --> 2:19:08.900
 Is that, do you live by those words or?

2:19:08.900 --> 2:19:10.820
 The first part of it for sure.

2:19:10.820 --> 2:19:11.980
 What do they even mean?

2:19:11.980 --> 2:19:12.820
 Cause.

2:19:12.820 --> 2:19:15.340
 You got to know when to hold, know when.

2:19:15.340 --> 2:19:17.540
 So basically it's like, all right, you know, in life,

2:19:17.540 --> 2:19:20.220
 like, you know, let's say, let's use a, whatever,

2:19:20.220 --> 2:19:23.100
 the market, for example, you bought a stock, right?

2:19:23.100 --> 2:19:24.260
 Or you bought Bitcoin and you're like,

2:19:24.260 --> 2:19:26.340
 it's going to go to the moon, right?

2:19:26.340 --> 2:19:29.540
 It's like, okay, well, maybe things have changed.

2:19:29.540 --> 2:19:32.460
 New scenario, new circumstances, new situation.

2:19:32.460 --> 2:19:34.780
 Are you going down with the ship, right?

2:19:34.780 --> 2:19:36.060
 Or are you going to lay the hand down?

2:19:36.060 --> 2:19:37.060
 Are you going to fold it?

2:19:37.060 --> 2:19:38.700
 Whether it's a relationship, you know,

2:19:38.700 --> 2:19:41.100
 you're with this woman, you're like, all right,

2:19:41.100 --> 2:19:43.020
 I think it's time to fold this one.

2:19:43.020 --> 2:19:44.060
 I think, you know,

2:19:44.060 --> 2:19:46.260
 I don't think that we're going to be able to make this,

2:19:46.260 --> 2:19:47.700
 this hand work right now.

2:19:47.700 --> 2:19:49.700
 When to fold them and when to run.

2:19:49.700 --> 2:19:50.540
 Yeah.

2:19:50.540 --> 2:19:54.100
 So maybe every gambler knows that the secret to surviving

2:19:54.100 --> 2:19:56.780
 is knowing what to throw away and knowing what to keep

2:19:56.780 --> 2:19:59.660
 because every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser.

2:19:59.660 --> 2:20:01.100
 That's like a stoic philosophy.

2:20:01.100 --> 2:20:04.940
 And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.

2:20:06.060 --> 2:20:09.220
 Every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser.

2:20:09.220 --> 2:20:10.340
 What does that mean?

2:20:10.340 --> 2:20:11.180
 I like that one.

2:20:11.180 --> 2:20:13.500
 I like, for me, that's like the difference between victim

2:20:13.500 --> 2:20:16.100
 and responsible, like the way that I think about it, right?

2:20:16.100 --> 2:20:18.100
 You can be a victim to circumstance

2:20:18.100 --> 2:20:20.380
 or you can be responsible for everything in your life, right?

2:20:20.380 --> 2:20:22.020
 So when an event happens,

2:20:22.020 --> 2:20:24.820
 the event itself is neither good or bad

2:20:24.820 --> 2:20:27.380
 until you assign it value, right?

2:20:27.380 --> 2:20:30.740
 So like an event happens and it can be traumatic,

2:20:30.740 --> 2:20:31.980
 it can be, you know, painful,

2:20:31.980 --> 2:20:33.820
 but you know, how you respond to it

2:20:33.820 --> 2:20:35.500
 is ultimately going to be up to you.

2:20:35.500 --> 2:20:36.740
 Like you actually do have a choice.

2:20:36.740 --> 2:20:38.940
 And that's the thing you can control.

2:20:38.940 --> 2:20:42.500
 The fact that you, Daniel Negrano took my commentary

2:20:42.500 --> 2:20:44.860
 about The Gambler seriously shows once more

2:20:44.860 --> 2:20:47.060
 that you're a beautiful human being.

2:20:47.060 --> 2:20:49.300
 Thank you so much for being who you are,

2:20:49.300 --> 2:20:51.740
 for inspiring millions of people about poker,

2:20:51.740 --> 2:20:53.020
 about how to live life.

2:20:53.020 --> 2:20:55.340
 And thank you for giving me your valuable time today.

2:20:55.340 --> 2:20:56.180
 This is amazing.

2:20:56.180 --> 2:20:57.020
 Thanks for talking.

2:20:57.020 --> 2:20:57.860
 It was fun, man.

2:20:57.860 --> 2:20:59.740
 It was great to have the conversation.

2:20:59.740 --> 2:21:01.220
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:21:01.220 --> 2:21:02.420
 with Daniel Negrano.

 And now let me leave you with some words

2:21:09.100 --> 2:21:11.380
 from Doyle Brunson.

2:21:11.380 --> 2:21:13.580
 Poker is war.

2:21:13.580 --> 2:21:15.540
 People pretend it is a game.

2:21:15.540 --> 2:21:40.540
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
