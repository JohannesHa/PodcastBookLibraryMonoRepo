00:00.000 --> 00:02.160
 Let me ask you to this question,

00:02.160 --> 00:04.240
 whether it's bell curve or any research

00:04.240 --> 00:06.320
 on race differences,

00:09.160 --> 00:12.440
 can that be used to increase the amount of racism

00:12.440 --> 00:14.880
 in the world, can that be used to increase

00:14.880 --> 00:16.920
 the amount of hate in the world?

00:16.920 --> 00:21.920
 My sense is there is such enormous reservoirs

00:24.120 --> 00:27.940
 of hate and racism that have nothing to do

00:27.940 --> 00:31.480
 with scientific knowledge of the data

00:31.480 --> 00:34.080
 that speak against that,

00:34.080 --> 00:39.080
 that no, I don't want to give racist groups

00:39.200 --> 00:42.020
 a veto power over what scientists study.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.960
 The following is a conversation with Richard Heyer

00:46.960 --> 00:49.320
 on the science of human intelligence.

00:49.320 --> 00:51.720
 This is a highly controversial topic,

00:51.720 --> 00:52.960
 but a critically important one

00:52.960 --> 00:54.980
 for understanding the human mind.

00:54.980 --> 00:57.680
 I hope you will join me in not shying away

00:57.680 --> 00:59.980
 from difficult topics like this,

00:59.980 --> 01:03.700
 and instead, let us try to navigate it

01:03.700 --> 01:06.460
 with empathy, rigor, and grace.

01:06.460 --> 01:08.800
 If you're watching this on video now,

01:08.800 --> 01:11.500
 I should mention that I'm recording this introduction

01:11.500 --> 01:14.580
 in an undisclosed location somewhere in the world.

01:14.580 --> 01:17.320
 I'm safe and happy and life is beautiful.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.400
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.360
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:22.360 --> 01:25.200
 in the description, and now, dear friends,

01:25.200 --> 01:27.920
 here's Richard Heyer.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.880
 What are the measures of human intelligence,

01:29.880 --> 01:31.560
 and how do we measure it?

01:31.560 --> 01:35.840
 Everybody has an idea of what they mean by intelligence.

01:35.840 --> 01:40.040
 In the vernacular, what I mean by intelligence

01:40.040 --> 01:42.560
 is just being smart, how well you reason,

01:42.560 --> 01:45.160
 how well you figure things out,

01:45.160 --> 01:48.680
 what you do when you don't know what to do.

01:48.680 --> 01:53.680
 Those are just kind of everyday common sense definitions

01:53.680 --> 01:56.660
 of how people use the word intelligence.

01:56.660 --> 01:59.500
 If you wanna do research on intelligence,

01:59.500 --> 02:03.360
 measuring something that you can study scientifically

02:03.360 --> 02:08.360
 is a little trickier, and what almost all researchers

02:09.120 --> 02:12.820
 who study intelligence use is the concept

02:12.820 --> 02:16.980
 called the G factor, general intelligence,

02:16.980 --> 02:21.640
 and that is what is common, that is a mental ability

02:21.640 --> 02:26.500
 that is common to virtually all tests of mental abilities.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.500
 What's the origin of the term G factor,

02:28.500 --> 02:29.820
 by the way, such a funny word

02:29.820 --> 02:32.060
 for such a fundamental human thing?

02:32.060 --> 02:35.580
 The general factor, I really started with Charles Spearman,

02:36.540 --> 02:39.060
 and he noticed, this is like, boy,

02:39.060 --> 02:44.060
 more than 100 years ago, he noticed that

02:44.140 --> 02:47.780
 when you tested people with different tests,

02:47.780 --> 02:51.960
 all the tests were correlated positively,

02:53.100 --> 02:57.380
 and so he was looking at student exams and things,

02:57.380 --> 03:01.620
 and he invented the correlation coefficient, essentially,

03:01.620 --> 03:06.380
 and when he used it to look at student performance

03:06.380 --> 03:09.920
 on various topics, he found all the scores

03:09.920 --> 03:11.920
 were correlated with each other,

03:11.920 --> 03:14.480
 and they were all positive correlations,

03:14.480 --> 03:17.540
 so he inferred from this that there must be

03:17.540 --> 03:21.220
 some common factor that was irrespective

03:21.220 --> 03:23.360
 of the content of the test.

03:23.360 --> 03:27.420
 And positive correlation means if you do well

03:27.420 --> 03:29.500
 on the first test, you're likely to do well

03:29.500 --> 03:31.760
 on the second test, and presumably,

03:31.760 --> 03:35.820
 that holds for tests across even disciplines,

03:35.820 --> 03:39.340
 so not within subject, but across subjects,

03:39.340 --> 03:43.020
 so that's where the general comes in,

03:43.020 --> 03:45.020
 something about general intelligence.

03:45.020 --> 03:46.980
 So when you were talking about measuring intelligence

03:46.980 --> 03:50.140
 and trying to figure out something difficult

03:50.140 --> 03:52.300
 about this world and how to solve the puzzles

03:52.300 --> 03:54.740
 of this world, that means, generally speaking,

03:54.740 --> 03:58.140
 not some specific test, but across all tests.

03:58.140 --> 04:01.340
 Absolutely right, and people get hung up on this

04:02.340 --> 04:04.860
 because they say, well, what about the ability

04:04.860 --> 04:08.860
 to do X, isn't that independent?

04:08.860 --> 04:12.000
 And they said, I know somebody who's very good at this

04:12.000 --> 04:15.360
 but not so good at this, this other thing.

04:15.360 --> 04:17.460
 And so there are a lot of examples like that,

04:17.460 --> 04:21.660
 but it's a general tendency, so exceptions

04:21.660 --> 04:26.500
 really don't disprove, your everyday experience

04:26.500 --> 04:30.740
 is not the same as what the data actually show.

04:30.740 --> 04:32.700
 And your everyday experience, when you say,

04:32.700 --> 04:36.580
 oh, I know someone who's good at X, but not so good at Y,

04:36.580 --> 04:39.100
 that doesn't contradict the statement of about,

04:39.100 --> 04:43.380
 he's not so good, but he's not the opposite.

04:43.380 --> 04:46.520
 He's not, it's not a negative correlation.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.880
 Okay, so we're not, our anecdotal data,

04:49.880 --> 04:53.740
 I know a guy who's really good at solving

04:53.740 --> 04:58.140
 some kind of visual thing, that's not sufficient

04:58.140 --> 05:00.020
 for us to understand actually the depths

05:00.020 --> 05:01.380
 of that person's intelligence.

05:01.380 --> 05:05.080
 So how, this idea of G factor,

05:07.480 --> 05:11.180
 how much evidence is there, how strong,

05:11.180 --> 05:13.700
 you know, given across the decades that this idea

05:13.700 --> 05:16.420
 has been around, how much has it been held up

05:16.420 --> 05:21.420
 that there is a universal sort of horsepower

05:21.580 --> 05:24.020
 of intelligence that's underneath all of it,

05:24.020 --> 05:27.340
 all the different tests we do to try to get to this thing

05:28.300 --> 05:32.000
 in the depths of the human mind that's a universal,

05:32.000 --> 05:34.820
 stable measure of a person's intelligence.

05:34.820 --> 05:38.820
 You used a couple of words in there, stable and.

05:38.820 --> 05:40.580
 We have to be precise with words?

05:40.580 --> 05:42.700
 I was hoping we can get away with being poetic.

05:42.700 --> 05:46.260
 We can, there's a lot about research in general,

05:46.260 --> 05:49.580
 not just intelligence research that is poetic.

05:49.580 --> 05:52.900
 Science has a punetic aspect to it.

05:52.900 --> 05:55.840
 Good scientists are very intuitive.

05:55.840 --> 05:59.220
 They're not just, hey, these are the numbers.

05:59.220 --> 06:02.100
 You have to kind of step back and see the big picture.

06:02.100 --> 06:05.960
 When it comes to intelligence research,

06:05.960 --> 06:09.660
 you asked how well has this general concept held up?

06:09.660 --> 06:13.140
 And I think I can say without fear

06:13.140 --> 06:16.260
 of being empirically contradicted,

06:16.260 --> 06:21.100
 that it is the most replicated finding in all of psychology.

06:21.100 --> 06:22.980
 Now, some cynics may say, well, big deal,

06:22.980 --> 06:25.460
 psychology, we all know there's a replication crisis

06:25.460 --> 06:28.420
 in psychology and a lot of this stuff doesn't replicate.

06:28.420 --> 06:29.700
 That's all true.

06:29.700 --> 06:33.540
 There is no replication crisis when it comes to studying

06:33.540 --> 06:36.780
 the existence of this general factor.

06:36.780 --> 06:38.940
 Let me tell you some things about it.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.420
 It looks like it's universal

06:42.420 --> 06:44.660
 that you find it in all cultures.

06:44.660 --> 06:47.760
 The way you find it, step back one step,

06:47.760 --> 06:51.760
 the way you find it is to give a battery of mental tests.

06:51.760 --> 06:52.780
 What battery?

06:52.780 --> 06:53.800
 You choose.

06:53.800 --> 06:57.100
 Take a battery of any mental tests you want,

06:57.100 --> 07:00.580
 give it to a large number of diverse people,

07:01.520 --> 07:05.740
 and you will be able to extract statistically

07:05.740 --> 07:09.020
 the commonality among all those tests.

07:09.020 --> 07:12.460
 It's done by a technique called factor analysis.

07:12.460 --> 07:17.460
 People think that this may be a statistical artifact

07:17.660 --> 07:21.340
 of some kind, it is not a statistical artifact.

07:21.340 --> 07:22.700
 What is factor analysis?

07:22.700 --> 07:26.180
 Factor analysis is a way of looking at a big set of data

07:26.180 --> 07:29.900
 and look at the correlation among the different test scores

07:29.900 --> 07:33.840
 and then find empirically the clusters of scores

07:33.840 --> 07:35.620
 that go together.

07:35.620 --> 07:37.340
 And there are different factors.

07:37.340 --> 07:39.380
 So if you have a bunch of mental tests,

07:39.380 --> 07:41.120
 there may be a verbal factor,

07:41.120 --> 07:43.320
 there may be a numerical factor,

07:43.320 --> 07:45.900
 there may be a visual spatial factor,

07:45.900 --> 07:50.220
 but those factors have variance in common with each other.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.000
 And that is the common,

07:53.060 --> 07:55.360
 that's what's common among all the tests

07:55.360 --> 07:58.100
 and that's what gets labeled the G factor.

07:58.100 --> 08:01.460
 So if you give a diverse battery of mental tests

08:01.460 --> 08:04.740
 and you extract a G factor from it,

08:04.740 --> 08:08.240
 that factor usually accounts for around half of the variance.

08:08.240 --> 08:12.860
 It's the single biggest factor, but it's not the only factor,

08:12.860 --> 08:17.220
 but it is the most reliable, it is the most stable,

08:17.220 --> 08:22.220
 and it seems to be very much influenced by genetics.

08:23.820 --> 08:28.220
 It's very hard to change the G factor with training

08:28.220 --> 08:32.860
 or drugs or anything else.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.980
 You don't know how to increase the G factor.

08:34.980 --> 08:36.920
 Okay, you said a lot of really interesting things there.

08:36.920 --> 08:40.940
 So first, I mean, just to get people used to it

08:40.940 --> 08:43.260
 in case they're not familiar with this idea,

08:43.260 --> 08:45.820
 G factor is what we mean.

08:45.820 --> 08:49.120
 So often there's this term used IQ,

08:50.340 --> 08:53.980
 which is the way IQ is used,

08:53.980 --> 08:57.540
 they really mean G factor in regular conversation.

08:58.900 --> 09:02.640
 Because what we mean by IQ, we mean intelligence

09:02.640 --> 09:04.500
 and what we mean by intelligence,

09:04.500 --> 09:07.300
 we mean general intelligence and general intelligence

09:07.300 --> 09:09.860
 in the human mind from a psychology,

09:09.860 --> 09:12.320
 from a serious rigorous scientific perspective

09:12.320 --> 09:13.900
 actually means G factor.

09:13.900 --> 09:15.780
 So G factor equals intelligence,

09:15.780 --> 09:18.460
 just in this conversation to define terms.

09:18.460 --> 09:22.220
 Okay, so there's this stable thing called G factor.

09:22.220 --> 09:27.220
 You said, now factor, you said factor many times,

09:27.220 --> 09:32.220
 means a measure that potentially could be reduced

09:33.500 --> 09:35.820
 to a single number across the different factors

09:35.820 --> 09:37.180
 you mentioned.

09:37.180 --> 09:42.180
 And what you said, it accounts for half, halfish.

09:45.060 --> 09:46.640
 Accounts for halfish of what?

09:46.640 --> 09:51.640
 Of variance across the different set of tests.

09:51.640 --> 09:56.500
 Set of tests, so if you do for some reason

09:56.500 --> 10:00.940
 well on some set of tests, what does that mean?

10:00.940 --> 10:03.340
 So that means there's some unique capabilities

10:03.340 --> 10:05.900
 outside of the G factor that might account for that.

10:05.900 --> 10:07.500
 And what are those?

10:07.500 --> 10:10.420
 What else is there besides the raw horsepower,

10:10.420 --> 10:13.380
 the engine inside your mind that generates intelligence?

10:13.380 --> 10:16.380
 There are test taking skills.

10:16.380 --> 10:20.880
 There are specific abilities.

10:20.880 --> 10:25.880
 Someone might be particularly good at mathematical things,

10:28.300 --> 10:32.140
 mathematical concepts, even simple arithmetic.

10:32.140 --> 10:34.340
 Some people are much better than others.

10:34.340 --> 10:36.420
 You might know people who can memorize,

10:36.420 --> 10:41.420
 and short term memory is another component of this.

10:42.540 --> 10:46.900
 Short term memory is one of the cognitive processes

10:46.900 --> 10:51.260
 that's most highly correlated with the G factor.

10:51.260 --> 10:56.260
 So all those things like memory,

10:56.260 --> 10:59.940
 test taking skills account for variability

10:59.940 --> 11:02.240
 across the test performances.

11:02.240 --> 11:06.460
 But so you can run, but you can't hide

11:06.460 --> 11:08.540
 from the thing that God gave you.

11:08.540 --> 11:12.940
 The genetics, so that G factor,

11:12.940 --> 11:15.120
 science says that G factor's there.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.900
 Each one of us have.

11:16.900 --> 11:19.380
 Each one of us has a G factor.

11:19.380 --> 11:20.220
 Oh boy.

11:20.220 --> 11:21.380
 Some have more than others.

11:21.380 --> 11:22.820
 I'm getting uncomfortable already.

11:22.820 --> 11:27.820
 Well, IQ is a score, and IQ, an IQ score

11:28.500 --> 11:32.420
 is a very good estimate of the G factor.

11:32.420 --> 11:36.100
 You can't measure G directly, there's no direct measure.

11:36.100 --> 11:39.880
 You estimate it from these statistical techniques.

11:39.880 --> 11:43.080
 But an IQ score is a good estimate, why?

11:43.080 --> 11:46.420
 Because a standard IQ test is a battery

11:46.420 --> 11:48.640
 of different mental abilities.

11:48.640 --> 11:51.380
 You combined it into one score,

11:51.380 --> 11:55.700
 and that score is highly correlated with the G factor,

11:55.700 --> 12:00.140
 even if you get better scores on some subtests than others.

12:00.140 --> 12:02.300
 Because again, it's what's common

12:02.300 --> 12:04.300
 to all these mental abilities.

12:04.300 --> 12:08.200
 So a good IQ test, and I'll ask you about that,

12:08.200 --> 12:13.200
 but a good IQ test tries to compress down that battery

12:13.340 --> 12:16.200
 of tests, like tries to get a nice battery,

12:16.200 --> 12:21.200
 the nice selection of variable tests into one test.

12:21.420 --> 12:24.180
 And so in that way, it sneaks up to this G factor.

12:24.180 --> 12:27.460
 And that's another interesting thing about G factor.

12:28.380 --> 12:32.380
 Now you give, first of all, you have a great book

12:32.380 --> 12:34.180
 on the neuroscience of intelligence.

12:34.180 --> 12:38.300
 You have a great course, which is when I first learned,

12:38.300 --> 12:39.820
 you're a great teacher, let me just say.

12:39.820 --> 12:40.660
 Thank you.

12:42.140 --> 12:44.180
 Your course at the teaching company,

12:44.180 --> 12:45.820
 I hope I'm saying that correctly.

12:45.820 --> 12:47.180
 The Intelligent Brain.

12:47.180 --> 12:50.520
 The Intelligent Brain is when I first heard

12:50.520 --> 12:53.820
 about this G factor, this mysterious thing

12:53.820 --> 12:56.300
 that lurks in the darkness that we cannot quite shine

12:56.300 --> 12:59.000
 a light on, we're trying to sneak up on.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.580
 So the fact that there's this measure,

13:00.580 --> 13:04.820
 a stable measure of intelligence, we can't measure directly.

13:04.820 --> 13:07.820
 But we can come up with a battery test

13:07.820 --> 13:10.300
 or one test that includes a battery

13:10.300 --> 13:15.300
 of variable type of questions that can reliably

13:17.460 --> 13:21.700
 or attempt to estimate in a stable way that G factor.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.340
 That's a fascinating idea.

13:23.340 --> 13:25.860
 So for me as an AI person, it's fascinating.

13:25.860 --> 13:27.900
 It's fascinating there's something stable like that

13:27.900 --> 13:32.020
 about the human mind, especially if it's grounded in genetics.

13:32.020 --> 13:37.020
 It's both fascinating that as a researcher

13:37.100 --> 13:42.100
 of the human mind and all the human psychological,

13:43.220 --> 13:46.560
 sociological, ethical questions that start arising,

13:46.560 --> 13:48.260
 it makes me uncomfortable.

13:48.260 --> 13:50.220
 But truth can be uncomfortable.

13:51.340 --> 13:54.180
 I get that a lot about being uncomfortable

13:54.180 --> 13:56.540
 talking about this.

13:56.540 --> 13:59.760
 Let me go back and just say one more empirical thing.

14:02.060 --> 14:07.060
 It doesn't matter which battery of tests you use.

14:08.700 --> 14:10.700
 So there are countless tests.

14:10.700 --> 14:13.500
 You can take any 12 of them at random,

14:13.500 --> 14:17.100
 extract a G factor and another 12 at random

14:17.100 --> 14:19.940
 and extract a G factor and those G factors

14:19.940 --> 14:23.160
 will be highly correlated like over 0.9 with each other.

14:23.160 --> 14:26.100
 That's very, so it is a ubiquitous.

14:26.100 --> 14:28.500
 It doesn't depend on the content of the test

14:28.500 --> 14:30.260
 is what I'm trying to say.

14:30.260 --> 14:34.020
 It is general among all those tests of mental ability.

14:34.020 --> 14:37.940
 And tests of mental, mental abilities include things like,

14:37.940 --> 14:41.260
 geez, playing poker.

14:41.260 --> 14:46.260
 Your skill at poker is not unrelated to G.

14:46.300 --> 14:49.460
 Your skill at anything that requires reasoning

14:49.460 --> 14:54.300
 and thinking, anything, spelling, arithmetic,

14:54.300 --> 14:59.300
 more complex things, this concept is ubiquitous.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.880
 And when you do batteries of tests in different cultures,

15:03.880 --> 15:05.800
 you get the same thing.

15:05.800 --> 15:08.880
 So this says something interesting about the human mind

15:08.880 --> 15:11.840
 that as a computer is designed to be general.

15:12.780 --> 15:17.780
 So that means you can, so it's not easily made specialized.

15:17.780 --> 15:21.940
 Meaning if you're going to be good at one thing,

15:21.940 --> 15:26.940
 Miyamoto Musashi has this quote, he's an ancient warrior,

15:26.940 --> 15:30.940
 famous for the Book of Five Rings in the martial arts world.

15:30.940 --> 15:34.180
 And the quote goes, if you know the way broadly,

15:34.180 --> 15:36.420
 you will see it in everything.

15:36.420 --> 15:41.420
 Meaning if you do one thing is going to generalize

15:42.660 --> 15:44.500
 to everything.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.620
 And that's an interesting quote.

15:46.620 --> 15:49.540
 And that's an interesting thing about the human mind.

15:50.660 --> 15:54.380
 So that's what the G factor reveals.

15:54.380 --> 15:57.060
 Okay, so what's the difference,

15:57.060 --> 15:58.900
 if you can elaborate a little bit further

15:58.900 --> 16:00.900
 between IQ and G factor?

16:00.900 --> 16:03.560
 Just because it's a source of confusion for people.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.660
 And IQ is a score.

16:05.660 --> 16:08.260
 People use the word IQ to mean intelligence.

16:08.260 --> 16:11.020
 But IQ has a more technical meaning

16:11.020 --> 16:12.740
 for people who work in the field.

16:12.740 --> 16:16.540
 And it's an IQ score, a score on a test

16:16.540 --> 16:18.980
 that estimates the G factor.

16:20.060 --> 16:22.020
 And the G factor is what's common

16:22.020 --> 16:24.200
 among all these tests of mental ability.

16:24.200 --> 16:27.040
 So if you think about, it's not a Venn diagram,

16:27.040 --> 16:30.580
 but I guess you could make a Venn diagram out of it,

16:30.580 --> 16:33.900
 but the G factor would be really at the core,

16:33.900 --> 16:37.540
 what's common to everything.

16:37.540 --> 16:42.540
 And what IQ scores do is they allow a rank order

16:42.540 --> 16:44.500
 of people on the score.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.900
 And this is what makes people uncomfortable.

16:46.900 --> 16:48.920
 This is where there's a lot of controversy

16:48.920 --> 16:51.540
 about whether IQ tests are biased

16:51.540 --> 16:54.380
 toward any one group or another.

16:54.380 --> 16:59.060
 And a lot of the answers to these questions are very clear,

16:59.060 --> 17:02.060
 but they also have a technical aspect of it

17:02.060 --> 17:04.180
 that's not so easy to explain.

17:04.180 --> 17:06.180
 Well, we'll talk about the fascinating

17:06.180 --> 17:08.260
 and the difficult things about all of this.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.560
 So by the way, when you say rank order,

17:12.560 --> 17:15.420
 that means you get a number and that means one person,

17:15.420 --> 17:17.540
 you can now compare.

17:17.540 --> 17:20.900
 Like you could say that this other person

17:20.900 --> 17:23.020
 is more intelligent than me.

17:23.020 --> 17:25.820
 Well, what you can say is IQ scores

17:25.820 --> 17:28.300
 are interpreted really as percentiles.

17:29.220 --> 17:33.300
 So that if you have an IQ of 140

17:33.300 --> 17:35.580
 and somebody else has 70,

17:35.580 --> 17:38.140
 the metric is such that you cannot say

17:38.140 --> 17:42.940
 the person with an IQ of 140 is twice as smart

17:42.940 --> 17:45.980
 as a person with an IQ of 70.

17:45.980 --> 17:49.900
 That would require a ratio scale with an absolute zero.

17:49.900 --> 17:53.140
 Now you may think you know people with zero intelligence,

17:53.140 --> 17:57.980
 but in fact, there is no absolute zero on an IQ scale.

17:57.980 --> 18:00.000
 It's relative to other people.

18:01.140 --> 18:03.220
 So relative to other people,

18:03.220 --> 18:06.300
 somebody with an IQ score of 140

18:06.300 --> 18:09.260
 is in the upper less than 1%,

18:09.260 --> 18:12.580
 whereas somebody with an IQ of 70

18:12.580 --> 18:15.500
 is two standard deviations below the mean.

18:15.500 --> 18:18.660
 That's a different percentile.

18:18.660 --> 18:20.920
 So it's similar to like in chess,

18:20.920 --> 18:25.920
 you have an ELO rating that's designed to rank order people.

18:27.740 --> 18:30.500
 So you can't say it's twice one person.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.500
 If your ELO rating is twice another person,

18:33.500 --> 18:35.740
 I don't think you're twice as good at chess.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.580
 It's not stable in that way,

18:37.580 --> 18:39.060
 but because it's very difficult

18:39.060 --> 18:41.440
 to do these kinds of comparisons.

18:41.440 --> 18:45.980
 But so what can we say about the number itself?

18:47.020 --> 18:50.500
 Is that stable across tests and so on, or no?

18:50.500 --> 18:54.060
 There are a number of statistical properties of any test.

18:54.060 --> 18:56.460
 They're called psychometric properties.

18:56.460 --> 18:59.340
 You have validity, you have reliability,

18:59.340 --> 19:02.780
 reliability, there are many different kinds of reliability.

19:02.780 --> 19:05.980
 They all essentially measure stability.

19:05.980 --> 19:09.780
 And IQ tests are stable within an individual.

19:09.780 --> 19:11.940
 There are some longitudinal studies

19:11.940 --> 19:15.840
 where children were measured at age 11.

19:15.840 --> 19:18.140
 And again, when they were 70 years old

19:18.140 --> 19:22.140
 and the two IQ scores are highly correlated with each other.

19:22.140 --> 19:25.360
 This comes from a fascinating study from Scotland.

19:26.260 --> 19:31.260
 In the 1930s, some researchers decided to get an IQ test

19:31.260 --> 19:35.900
 on every single child age 11 in the whole country.

19:35.900 --> 19:37.340
 And they did.

19:37.340 --> 19:42.340
 And those records were discovered in an old storeroom

19:42.980 --> 19:47.020
 at the University of Edinburgh by a friend of mine,

19:47.020 --> 19:52.020
 Ian Deary, who found the records, digitized them,

19:52.180 --> 19:53.940
 and has done a lot of research

19:53.940 --> 19:57.220
 on the people who are still alive today

19:57.220 --> 19:58.540
 from that original study,

19:58.540 --> 20:00.620
 including brain imaging research, by the way.

20:00.620 --> 20:04.420
 It really, it's a fascinating group of people

20:04.420 --> 20:06.360
 who are studied.

20:08.100 --> 20:09.300
 Not to get ahead of the story,

20:09.300 --> 20:12.540
 but one of the most interesting things they found

20:12.540 --> 20:14.660
 is a very strong relationship

20:14.660 --> 20:19.660
 between IQ measured at age 11 and mortality.

20:21.680 --> 20:24.380
 So that, you know,

20:24.380 --> 20:29.380
 in the 70 years later, they looked at the survival rates

20:30.940 --> 20:33.300
 and they could get death records from everybody.

20:33.300 --> 20:37.140
 And Scotland has universal healthcare for everybody.

20:37.140 --> 20:40.020
 And it turned out if you divide the people

20:40.020 --> 20:44.020
 by their age 11 IQ score into quartiles

20:44.020 --> 20:48.700
 and then look at how many people are alive 70 years later,

20:49.460 --> 20:52.420
 the, I know this is in the book,

20:52.420 --> 20:54.660
 I have the graph in the book,

20:54.660 --> 20:57.820
 but there are essentially twice as many people alive

20:57.820 --> 21:01.820
 in the highest IQ quartile than in the lowest IQ quartile.

21:01.820 --> 21:03.640
 It's true in men and women.

21:05.300 --> 21:06.940
 Interesting.

21:06.940 --> 21:08.100
 So it makes a big difference.

21:08.100 --> 21:12.920
 Now, why this is the case is not so clear

21:12.920 --> 21:15.620
 since everyone had access to healthcare.

21:15.620 --> 21:18.340
 Well, there's a lot, and we'll talk about it, you know,

21:18.340 --> 21:22.100
 just the sentences you used now

21:22.100 --> 21:25.780
 could be explained by nature or nurture.

21:25.780 --> 21:26.980
 We don't know.

21:26.980 --> 21:29.700
 Now, there's a lot of science that starts to then dig in

21:29.700 --> 21:31.700
 and investigate that question.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.700
 But let me linger on the IQ test.

21:33.700 --> 21:37.380
 How are the test design, IQ test design, how do they work?

21:37.380 --> 21:39.980
 Maybe some examples for people who are not aware.

21:39.980 --> 21:44.020
 What makes a good IQ test question

21:44.020 --> 21:48.080
 that sneaks up on this G factor measure?

21:48.080 --> 21:49.740
 Well, your question is interesting

21:49.740 --> 21:53.340
 because you want me to give examples of items

21:53.340 --> 21:55.220
 that make good items.

21:55.220 --> 21:59.420
 And what makes a good item is not so much its content,

21:59.420 --> 22:03.180
 but its empirical relationship to the total score

22:03.180 --> 22:07.740
 that turns out to be valid by other means.

22:07.740 --> 22:12.500
 So for example, let me give you an odd example

22:12.500 --> 22:14.300
 from personality testing.

22:14.300 --> 22:15.560
 Nice.

22:15.560 --> 22:18.020
 So there's a personality test

22:18.020 --> 22:22.740
 called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, MMPI.

22:22.740 --> 22:24.100
 Been around for decades.

22:24.100 --> 22:25.980
 I've heard about this test recently

22:25.980 --> 22:29.240
 because of the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trial.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.180
 I don't know if you've been paying attention to that.

22:31.180 --> 22:32.020
 But they had psychologists.

22:32.020 --> 22:33.540
 I have not been paying attention to it.

22:33.540 --> 22:35.820
 They had psychologists on the stand,

22:35.820 --> 22:38.900
 and they were talking, apparently those psychologists did,

22:39.860 --> 22:42.020
 again, I'm learning so much from this trial.

22:42.020 --> 22:45.820
 They did different battery of tests

22:45.820 --> 22:50.420
 to diagnose personality disorders.

22:50.420 --> 22:53.300
 Apparently there's that systematic way of doing so,

22:53.300 --> 22:55.740
 and the Minnesota one is one of the ones

22:55.740 --> 22:59.020
 that there's the most science on.

22:59.020 --> 23:00.440
 There's a lot of great papers,

23:00.440 --> 23:03.820
 which were all continuously cited on the stand,

23:03.820 --> 23:05.060
 which is fascinating to watch.

23:05.060 --> 23:06.540
 Sorry, a little bit of attention.

23:06.540 --> 23:07.380
 It's okay.

23:07.380 --> 23:08.220
 I mean, this is interesting because you're right.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.540
 It's been around for decades.

23:09.540 --> 23:11.220
 There's a lot of scientific research

23:11.220 --> 23:14.820
 on the psychometric properties of the test,

23:14.820 --> 23:18.000
 including what it predicts with respect

23:18.000 --> 23:22.320
 to different categories of personality disorder.

23:22.320 --> 23:24.840
 But what I wanna mention is the content

23:24.840 --> 23:26.860
 of the items on that test.

23:26.860 --> 23:31.860
 All of the items are essentially true false items.

23:32.440 --> 23:35.880
 True or false, I prefer a shower to a bath.

23:36.860 --> 23:39.900
 True or false, I think Lincoln

23:39.900 --> 23:42.260
 was a better president than Washington.

23:42.260 --> 23:46.600
 But what of all these, what does that have to do?

23:47.560 --> 23:49.720
 And the point is the content of these items,

23:49.720 --> 23:54.720
 nobody knows why these items in aggregate predict anything,

23:55.360 --> 23:57.900
 but empirically they do.

23:57.900 --> 24:01.880
 It's a technique of choosing items for a test

24:01.880 --> 24:04.840
 that is called dust bowl empiricism.

24:05.800 --> 24:07.440
 That the content doesn't matter,

24:07.440 --> 24:10.640
 but for some reason when you get a criterion group

24:10.640 --> 24:13.600
 of people with this disorder and you compare them

24:13.600 --> 24:16.120
 to people without that disorder,

24:16.120 --> 24:19.200
 these are the items that distinguish,

24:19.200 --> 24:20.640
 irrespective of content.

24:20.640 --> 24:22.700
 It's a hard concept to grasp.

24:22.700 --> 24:25.260
 Well, first of all, it's fascinating.

24:25.260 --> 24:30.260
 But from, because I consider myself part psychologist

24:33.000 --> 24:35.360
 because I love human robot interaction,

24:35.360 --> 24:36.600
 and that's a problem.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.600
 Half of that problem is a psychology problem

24:39.600 --> 24:40.760
 because there's a human.

24:41.800 --> 24:45.200
 So designing these tests to get at the questions

24:45.200 --> 24:46.440
 is the fascinating part.

24:46.440 --> 24:50.000
 Like how do you get to,

24:50.000 --> 24:52.700
 like what does dust bowl empiricism refer to?

24:52.700 --> 24:57.460
 Does it refer to the final result?

24:57.460 --> 25:01.540
 Yeah, so it's the test is dust bowl empiricism.

25:01.540 --> 25:04.960
 But how do you arrive at the battery of questions?

25:04.960 --> 25:07.560
 I presume one of the things,

25:07.560 --> 25:10.080
 now again, I'm going to the excellent testimony

25:10.080 --> 25:12.600
 in that trial, they explain it,

25:12.600 --> 25:14.760
 because they also, they explain the tests.

25:16.720 --> 25:19.280
 That a bunch of the questions are kind of

25:20.320 --> 25:24.040
 make you forget that you're taking a test.

25:24.040 --> 25:26.720
 Like it makes it very difficult for you

25:26.720 --> 25:31.640
 to somehow figure out what you're supposed to answer.

25:31.640 --> 25:34.120
 Yes, it's called social desirability.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.580
 But we're getting a little far afield

25:35.580 --> 25:37.400
 because I only wanted to give that example

25:37.400 --> 25:39.200
 of dust bowl empiricism.

25:40.500 --> 25:44.400
 When we talk about the items on an IQ test,

25:44.400 --> 25:49.400
 many of those items in the dust bowl empiricism method

25:50.640 --> 25:52.960
 have no face validity.

25:52.960 --> 25:56.440
 In other words, they don't look like they measure anything.

25:56.440 --> 25:57.540
 Yes.

25:57.540 --> 25:59.920
 Whereas most intelligence tests,

25:59.920 --> 26:02.220
 the items actually look like they're measuring

26:02.220 --> 26:03.880
 some mental ability.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.320
 So here's one of the.

26:05.320 --> 26:07.000
 So you were bringing that up as an example

26:07.000 --> 26:08.200
 as what it is not.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.040
 Yes.

26:09.040 --> 26:09.860
 Got it.

26:09.860 --> 26:10.700
 Okay.

26:10.700 --> 26:12.880
 So I don't want to go too far afield on it.

26:12.880 --> 26:16.120
 Too far afield is actually one of the names of this podcast.

26:16.120 --> 26:19.080
 So I should mention that.

26:19.080 --> 26:20.000
 Far afield.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.120
 Far afield.

26:21.120 --> 26:22.240
 Yeah, so anyway, sorry.

26:22.240 --> 26:25.000
 So they feel the questions look like

26:25.000 --> 26:28.040
 they pass the face validity test.

26:28.040 --> 26:29.720
 And some more than others.

26:29.720 --> 26:32.680
 So for example, let me give you a couple of things here.

26:32.680 --> 26:37.320
 If I, one of the subtests on a standard IQ test

26:37.320 --> 26:39.560
 is general information.

26:40.860 --> 26:41.880
 Let me just think a little bit

26:41.880 --> 26:44.360
 because I don't want to give you the actual item.

26:44.360 --> 26:49.360
 But if I said, how far is it between Washington DC

26:49.820 --> 26:51.240
 and Miami, Florida?

26:52.320 --> 26:54.740
 Within 500 miles plus or minus.

26:55.700 --> 27:00.080
 Well, you know, it's not a fact most people memorize,

27:00.080 --> 27:02.720
 but you know something about geography.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.480
 You say, well, I flew there once.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.600
 I know planes fly for 500 miles.

27:06.600 --> 27:09.200
 You know, you can kind of make an estimate.

27:10.360 --> 27:13.900
 But it's also seems like it would be very cultural,

27:15.280 --> 27:20.240
 you know, so there's that kind of general information.

27:20.240 --> 27:22.520
 Then there's vocabulary test.

27:22.520 --> 27:27.520
 What does regatta mean?

27:27.520 --> 27:31.320
 And I choose that word because that word was removed

27:31.320 --> 27:33.760
 from the IQ test because people complained

27:33.760 --> 27:38.280
 that disadvantaged people would not know that word

27:38.280 --> 27:41.440
 just from their everyday life.

27:41.440 --> 27:43.920
 Okay, here's another example

27:43.920 --> 27:46.520
 from a different kind of subtest on.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.200
 What's regatta, by the way?

27:48.200 --> 27:50.400
 Regatta is a.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.640
 I think I'm disadvantaged.

27:51.640 --> 27:54.800
 A sailing competition, a competition with boats.

27:54.800 --> 27:58.760
 Not necessarily sailing, but a competition with boats.

27:58.760 --> 28:02.200
 Yep, yep, I'm probably disadvantaged in that way.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.960
 Okay, excellent, so that was removed anyway you were saying.

28:04.960 --> 28:07.840
 Okay, so here's another subtest.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.840
 I'm gonna repeat a string of numbers,

28:09.840 --> 28:12.680
 and when I'm done, I want you to repeat them back to me.

28:12.680 --> 28:13.720
 Ready?

28:13.720 --> 28:18.720
 Okay, seven, four, two, eight, one, six.

28:21.540 --> 28:22.560
 That's way too many.

28:22.560 --> 28:25.160
 Seven, four, two, eight, one, six.

28:25.160 --> 28:26.280
 Okay, you get the idea.

28:26.280 --> 28:30.800
 Now the actual test starts with a smaller number,

28:30.800 --> 28:33.500
 like two numbers, and then as people get it right,

28:33.500 --> 28:36.520
 you keep going, adding to the string of numbers

28:36.520 --> 28:38.600
 until they can't do it anymore.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.720
 Okay, but now try this.

28:40.720 --> 28:43.760
 I'm gonna say some numbers, and when I'm done,

28:43.760 --> 28:46.640
 I want you to repeat them to me backwards.

28:46.640 --> 28:47.800
 I quit.

28:47.800 --> 28:51.520
 Okay, now, so I gave you some examples

28:51.520 --> 28:53.600
 of the kind of items on an IQ test.

28:53.600 --> 28:58.600
 General information, I can't even remember all,

28:58.640 --> 29:03.640
 general information, vocabulary, digit span forward

29:03.680 --> 29:06.760
 and digit span backward.

29:06.760 --> 29:08.960
 Well, you said I can't even remember them.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.480
 That's a good question for me.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.600
 What does memory have to do with GFactor?

29:13.600 --> 29:15.200
 Okay, well, let's hold on.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.280
 Okay, all right.

29:16.280 --> 29:19.720
 Let's just talk about these examples.

29:19.720 --> 29:24.720
 Now, some of those items seem very cultural,

29:26.760 --> 29:29.940
 and others seem less cultural.

29:31.960 --> 29:35.400
 Which ones do you think, scores on which subtest

29:35.400 --> 29:38.440
 are most highly correlated with the GFactor?

29:39.640 --> 29:42.560
 Well, the intuitive answer is less cultural.

29:42.560 --> 29:49.560
 Well, it turns out vocabulary is highly correlated,

29:49.860 --> 29:54.220
 and it turns out that digit span backwards

29:54.220 --> 29:55.740
 is highly correlated.

29:55.740 --> 29:58.620
 How do you figure?

29:58.620 --> 30:03.300
 Now you have decades of research to answer the question,

30:03.300 --> 30:04.580
 how do you figure?

30:04.580 --> 30:08.980
 Right, so now there's good research that gives you

30:08.980 --> 30:11.940
 intuition about what kind of questions get at it,

30:11.940 --> 30:16.940
 just like there's something I've done,

30:18.100 --> 30:21.980
 I've actually used for research in semi autonomous vehicle,

30:21.980 --> 30:24.360
 like whether humans are paying attention,

30:24.360 --> 30:28.460
 there's a body of literature that does end back test,

30:28.460 --> 30:33.460
 for example, we have to put workload on the brain

30:35.620 --> 30:38.900
 to do recall, memory recall, and that helps you

30:38.900 --> 30:42.080
 kind of put some work onto the brain

30:42.080 --> 30:44.260
 while the person is doing some other task,

30:44.260 --> 30:46.800
 and does some interesting research with that.

30:47.700 --> 30:48.940
 But that's loading the memory,

30:48.940 --> 30:52.260
 so there's like research around stably

30:52.260 --> 30:54.100
 what that means about the human mind,

30:54.100 --> 30:57.100
 and here you're saying recall backwards

30:58.420 --> 31:00.020
 is a good protector.

31:00.020 --> 31:01.740
 It's a transformation.

31:01.740 --> 31:04.140
 Yeah, so you have to do some,

31:05.700 --> 31:07.820
 like you have to load that into your brain,

31:07.820 --> 31:11.220
 and not just remember it, but do something with it.

31:11.220 --> 31:14.460
 Right, here's another example of a different kind of test

31:14.460 --> 31:18.360
 called the Hick paradigm, and it's not verbal at all.

31:18.360 --> 31:23.140
 It's a little box, and there are a series of lights

31:23.140 --> 31:26.580
 arranged in a semi circle at the top of the box,

31:27.420 --> 31:31.300
 and then there's a home button that you press,

31:31.300 --> 31:33.880
 and when one of the lights goes on,

31:34.740 --> 31:37.780
 there's a button next to each of those lights,

31:37.780 --> 31:39.940
 you take your finger off the home button,

31:39.940 --> 31:41.980
 and you just press the button

31:41.980 --> 31:44.100
 next to the light that goes on,

31:44.100 --> 31:46.500
 and so it's a very simple reaction time.

31:46.500 --> 31:49.220
 Light goes on, as quick as you can, you press the button,

31:49.220 --> 31:50.540
 and you get a reaction time

31:50.540 --> 31:53.700
 from the moment you lift your finger off the button

31:53.700 --> 31:58.620
 to when you press the button where the light is.

31:58.620 --> 32:02.160
 That reaction time doesn't really correlate

32:02.160 --> 32:07.160
 with IQ very much, but if you change the instructions,

32:07.160 --> 32:12.160
 and you say three lights are gonna come on simultaneously,

32:13.120 --> 32:15.600
 I want you to press the button next to the light

32:15.600 --> 32:17.840
 that's furthest from the other two.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.260
 So maybe lights one and two go on,

32:21.260 --> 32:24.320
 and light six goes on simultaneously.

32:24.320 --> 32:25.560
 You take your finger off,

32:25.560 --> 32:27.920
 and you would press the button by light six.

32:28.880 --> 32:33.880
 That's that reaction time to a more complex task.

32:34.360 --> 32:36.360
 It's not really hard.

32:36.360 --> 32:38.360
 Almost everybody gets it all right,

32:38.360 --> 32:41.040
 but your reaction time to that

32:41.040 --> 32:43.760
 is highly correlated with the G factor.

32:43.760 --> 32:45.040
 This is fascinating.

32:45.040 --> 32:48.560
 So reaction time, so there's a temporal aspect to this.

32:48.560 --> 32:50.040
 So what role does time?

32:50.040 --> 32:50.880
 Speed of processing.

32:50.880 --> 32:53.020
 It's the speed of processing.

32:53.020 --> 32:55.740
 Is this also true for ones that take longer,

32:55.740 --> 32:57.700
 like five, 10, 30 seconds?

32:58.640 --> 33:01.200
 Is time part of the measure with some of these things?

33:01.200 --> 33:05.640
 Yes, and that is why some of the best IQ tests

33:05.640 --> 33:10.640
 have a time limit, because if you have no time limit,

33:10.640 --> 33:12.960
 people can do better,

33:12.960 --> 33:17.760
 but it doesn't distinguish among people that well.

33:17.760 --> 33:21.440
 So that adding the time element is important.

33:21.440 --> 33:24.120
 So speed of information processing,

33:25.020 --> 33:26.680
 and reaction time is a measure

33:26.680 --> 33:29.320
 of speed of information processing,

33:29.320 --> 33:31.920
 turns out to be related to the G factor.

33:31.920 --> 33:35.040
 But the G factor only accounts for maybe half

33:35.040 --> 33:37.540
 or some amount on the test performance.

33:37.540 --> 33:42.040
 For example, I get pretty bad test anxiety.

33:42.040 --> 33:44.420
 Like I was never, I mean,

33:46.280 --> 33:47.800
 I just don't enjoy tests.

33:47.800 --> 33:51.280
 I enjoy going back into my cave and working.

33:51.280 --> 33:55.180
 Like I've always enjoyed homework way more than tests,

33:56.080 --> 33:57.800
 no matter how hard the homework is,

33:57.800 --> 33:59.360
 because I can go back to the cave

33:59.360 --> 34:00.760
 and hide away and think deeply.

34:00.760 --> 34:02.700
 There's something about being watched

34:02.700 --> 34:06.040
 and having a time limit that really makes me anxious,

34:06.040 --> 34:10.200
 and I can just see the mind not operating optimally at all.

34:10.200 --> 34:11.640
 But you're saying underneath there,

34:11.640 --> 34:13.720
 there's still a G factor, there's still.

34:13.720 --> 34:16.400
 No question, there's no question.

34:16.400 --> 34:17.240
 Boy.

34:17.240 --> 34:19.280
 And if you get anxious taking the test,

34:19.280 --> 34:20.880
 many people say, oh, I didn't do well,

34:20.880 --> 34:21.920
 because I'm anxious.

34:23.560 --> 34:24.760
 I hear that a lot.

34:24.760 --> 34:28.360
 Say, well, fine, if you're really anxious during the test,

34:28.360 --> 34:32.040
 the score will be a bad estimate of your G factor.

34:32.040 --> 34:34.040
 It doesn't mean the G factor isn't there.

34:34.040 --> 34:34.880
 That's right.

34:34.880 --> 34:39.120
 And by the way, standardized tests like the SAT,

34:40.600 --> 34:43.060
 they're essentially intelligence tests.

34:43.060 --> 34:45.240
 They are highly G loaded.

34:45.240 --> 34:49.360
 Now, the people who make the SAT don't wanna mention that.

34:50.680 --> 34:54.020
 They have enough trouble justifying standardized testing,

34:54.020 --> 34:56.020
 but to call it an intelligence test

34:56.020 --> 34:58.440
 is really beyond the pale.

34:58.440 --> 35:00.720
 But in fact, it's so highly correlated,

35:00.720 --> 35:03.200
 because it's a reasoning test.

35:03.200 --> 35:04.880
 SAT is a reasoning test,

35:04.880 --> 35:08.240
 a verbal reasoning, mathematical reasoning.

35:08.240 --> 35:12.240
 And if it's a reasoning test, it has to be related to G.

35:14.040 --> 35:17.560
 But if people go in and take a standardized test,

35:17.560 --> 35:20.120
 whether it's an IQ test or the SAT,

35:20.120 --> 35:24.600
 and they happen to be sick that day with 102 fever,

35:24.600 --> 35:29.600
 the score is not going to be a good estimate of their G.

35:29.600 --> 35:33.080
 If they retake the test when they're not anxious

35:33.080 --> 35:35.720
 or less anxious or don't have a fever,

35:36.640 --> 35:39.960
 the score will go up, and that will be a better estimate.

35:39.960 --> 35:43.120
 But you can't say their G factor increased

35:43.120 --> 35:45.160
 between the two tests.

35:45.160 --> 35:46.480
 Well, it's interesting.

35:46.480 --> 35:50.000
 So the question is how wide of a battery of tests

35:50.000 --> 35:53.380
 is required to estimate the G factor well?

35:53.380 --> 35:55.180
 Because I'll give you as my personal example,

35:55.180 --> 35:58.720
 I took the SAT in, I think it was called the ACT,

35:58.720 --> 36:02.880
 where I was two, also, I took SAT many times.

36:02.880 --> 36:05.480
 Every single time, I got it perfect on math.

36:05.480 --> 36:08.760
 And verbal, the time limit on the verbal

36:08.760 --> 36:10.960
 made me very anxious.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.480
 I did not, I mean, part of it,

36:12.480 --> 36:14.200
 I didn't speak English very well.

36:14.200 --> 36:17.440
 But honestly, it was like you're supposed to remember stuff,

36:17.440 --> 36:18.760
 and I was so anxious.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.640
 And as I'm reading, I'm sweating, I can't,

36:21.640 --> 36:26.640
 you know that feeling you have when you're reading a book

36:26.640 --> 36:30.100
 and you just read a page and you know nothing

36:30.100 --> 36:32.600
 about what you've read because you zoned out.

36:32.600 --> 36:36.440
 That's the same feeling of like, I can't, I have to,

36:36.440 --> 36:39.480
 you're like, nope, read and understand.

36:39.480 --> 36:43.080
 And that anxiety is like, and you start seeing

36:43.080 --> 36:47.120
 like the typography versus the content of the words.

36:47.120 --> 36:50.300
 Like that was, I don't, it's interesting

36:50.300 --> 36:55.300
 because I know that what they're measuring,

36:55.300 --> 36:58.780
 I could see being correlated with something.

36:58.780 --> 37:02.840
 But that anxiety or some aspect of the performance

37:04.660 --> 37:07.020
 sure plays a factor.

37:07.020 --> 37:10.420
 And I wonder how you sneak up in a stable way.

37:10.420 --> 37:11.900
 I mean, this is a broader discussion

37:11.900 --> 37:16.580
 about like standardized testing, how you sneak up,

37:16.580 --> 37:19.860
 how you get at the fact that I'm super anxious

37:19.860 --> 37:22.260
 and still nevertheless measure some aspect

37:22.260 --> 37:23.100
 of my ontology.

37:23.100 --> 37:24.860
 I wonder, I don't know.

37:24.860 --> 37:26.640
 I don't know if you can say to that,

37:26.640 --> 37:28.540
 that time limit sure is a pain.

37:28.540 --> 37:30.540
 Well, let me say this.

37:30.540 --> 37:34.160
 There are two ways to approach the very real problem

37:34.160 --> 37:36.880
 that you say that some people just get anxious

37:36.880 --> 37:38.940
 or not good test takers.

37:38.940 --> 37:43.940
 By the way, part of testing is you know the answer,

37:45.620 --> 37:48.380
 you can figure out the answer or you can't.

37:49.980 --> 37:52.900
 If you don't know the answer, there are many reasons

37:52.900 --> 37:55.240
 you don't know the answer at that particular moment.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.580
 You may have learned it once and forgotten it.

37:58.460 --> 38:00.580
 It may be on the tip of your tongue

38:00.580 --> 38:01.860
 and you just can't get it

38:01.860 --> 38:03.820
 because you're anxious about the time limit.

38:03.820 --> 38:05.860
 You may never have learned it.

38:05.860 --> 38:08.660
 You may have been exposed to it,

38:08.660 --> 38:11.420
 but it was too complicated and you couldn't learn it.

38:11.420 --> 38:13.940
 I mean, there are all kinds of reasons here.

38:13.940 --> 38:18.820
 But for an individual to interpret your scores

38:18.820 --> 38:23.340
 as an individual, whoever is interpreting the score

38:23.340 --> 38:26.260
 has to take into account various things

38:26.260 --> 38:29.220
 that would affect your individual score.

38:29.220 --> 38:32.740
 And that's why decisions about college admission

38:32.740 --> 38:35.720
 or anything else where tests are used

38:35.720 --> 38:40.720
 are hardly ever the only criterion to make a decision.

38:42.340 --> 38:45.160
 And I think people are, college admissions

38:45.160 --> 38:46.860
 letting go of that very much.

38:46.860 --> 38:48.100
 Oh yes, yeah.

38:48.100 --> 38:51.060
 But what does that even mean?

38:51.060 --> 38:55.540
 Because is it possible to design standardized tests

38:55.540 --> 38:58.420
 that do get, that are useful to college admissions?

38:58.420 --> 38:59.740
 Well, they already exist.

38:59.740 --> 39:03.820
 The SAT is highly correlated with many aspects

39:03.820 --> 39:05.220
 of success at college.

39:05.220 --> 39:06.380
 Here's the problem.

39:06.380 --> 39:09.220
 So maybe you could speak to this.

39:09.220 --> 39:13.360
 The correlation across the population versus individuals.

39:13.360 --> 39:18.360
 So our criminal justice system is designed to make sure,

39:23.420 --> 39:27.300
 wow, it's still, there's tragic cases

39:27.300 --> 39:29.700
 where innocent people go to jail,

39:29.700 --> 39:31.340
 but you try to avoid that.

39:31.340 --> 39:34.460
 And the same way with testing,

39:34.460 --> 39:38.780
 it just, it would suck for an SAT to miss genius.

39:38.780 --> 39:43.260
 Yes, and it's possible, but it's statistically unlikely.

39:43.260 --> 39:48.260
 So it really comes down to which piece of information

39:51.980 --> 39:56.980
 maximizes your decision making ability.

39:58.640 --> 40:03.640
 So if you just use high school grades, it's okay.

40:05.300 --> 40:07.100
 But you will miss some people

40:07.100 --> 40:09.140
 who just don't do well in high school,

40:09.140 --> 40:11.340
 but who are actually pretty smart,

40:11.340 --> 40:13.980
 smart enough to be bored silly in high school,

40:13.980 --> 40:14.940
 and they don't care,

40:14.940 --> 40:17.780
 and their high school GPA isn't that good.

40:17.780 --> 40:21.380
 So you will miss them in the same sense

40:21.380 --> 40:25.980
 that somebody who could be very able and ready for college

40:25.980 --> 40:28.340
 just doesn't do well on their SAT.

40:28.340 --> 40:31.660
 This is why you make decisions

40:31.660 --> 40:36.140
 with taking in a variety of information.

40:36.140 --> 40:38.080
 The other thing I wanted to say,

40:38.080 --> 40:43.080
 I talked about when you make a decision for an individual,

40:43.840 --> 40:46.720
 statistically for groups,

40:46.720 --> 40:50.060
 there are many people who have a disparity

40:50.060 --> 40:53.080
 between their math score and their verbal score.

40:53.080 --> 40:55.640
 That disparity, or the other way around,

40:55.640 --> 40:58.680
 that disparity is called tilt.

40:58.680 --> 41:01.760
 The score is tilted one way or the other.

41:01.760 --> 41:05.080
 And that tilt has been studied empirically

41:05.080 --> 41:07.320
 to see what that predicts.

41:07.320 --> 41:09.440
 And in fact, you can't make predictions

41:09.440 --> 41:14.440
 about college success based on tilt.

41:14.880 --> 41:16.760
 And mathematics is a good example.

41:16.760 --> 41:18.320
 There are many people,

41:18.320 --> 41:20.680
 especially non native speakers of English

41:20.680 --> 41:22.360
 who come to this country,

41:22.360 --> 41:24.940
 take the SATs, do very well on the math

41:24.940 --> 41:26.840
 and not so well on the verbal.

41:26.840 --> 41:31.220
 Well, if they're applying to a math program,

41:31.220 --> 41:33.840
 the professors there who are making the decision

41:33.840 --> 41:35.400
 or the admissions officers

41:35.400 --> 41:39.600
 don't wait so much to score on verbal,

41:39.600 --> 41:42.080
 especially if it's a non native speaker.

41:42.080 --> 41:44.480
 Well, so yeah, you have to try to,

41:44.480 --> 41:47.800
 in the admission process, bring in the context.

41:47.800 --> 41:50.760
 But non native isn't really the problem.

41:50.760 --> 41:53.720
 I mean, that was part of the problem for me.

41:53.720 --> 41:57.980
 But it's the anxiety was, which it's interesting.

41:57.980 --> 41:59.000
 It's interesting.

41:59.000 --> 42:04.000
 Oh boy, reducing yourself down to numbers.

42:06.560 --> 42:07.880
 But it's still true.

42:07.880 --> 42:09.240
 It's still the truth.

42:09.240 --> 42:10.760
 It's a painful truth.

42:10.760 --> 42:13.220
 That same anxiety that led me to be,

42:16.080 --> 42:20.600
 to struggle with the SAT verbal tests

42:20.600 --> 42:24.640
 is still within me in all ways of life.

42:24.640 --> 42:26.880
 So maybe that's not anxiety.

42:26.880 --> 42:30.600
 Maybe that's something, like personality

42:30.600 --> 42:32.380
 is also pretty stable.

42:32.380 --> 42:34.480
 Personality is stable.

42:34.480 --> 42:39.480
 Personality does impact the way you navigate life.

42:41.040 --> 42:42.460
 There's no question.

42:42.460 --> 42:45.680
 Yeah, and we should say that the G factor in intelligence

42:45.680 --> 42:50.400
 is not just about some kind of number on a paper.

42:50.400 --> 42:53.940
 It also has to do with how you navigate life.

42:53.940 --> 42:58.940
 How easy life is for you in this very complicated world.

43:00.880 --> 43:02.880
 So personality's all tied into that

43:02.880 --> 43:05.880
 in some deep fundamental way.

43:05.880 --> 43:07.720
 But now you've hit the key point

43:07.720 --> 43:11.320
 about why we even want to study intelligence.

43:11.320 --> 43:13.360
 And personality, I think, to a lesser extent.

43:13.360 --> 43:17.480
 But that's my interest, is more on intelligence.

43:17.480 --> 43:20.140
 I went to graduate school and wanted to study personality,

43:20.140 --> 43:22.640
 but that's kind of another story

43:22.640 --> 43:25.240
 how I got kind of shifted from personality research

43:25.240 --> 43:27.440
 over to intelligence research.

43:27.440 --> 43:30.040
 Because it's not just a number.

43:30.040 --> 43:32.560
 Intelligence is not just an IQ score.

43:32.560 --> 43:34.740
 It's not just an SAT score.

43:34.740 --> 43:39.740
 It's what those numbers reflect about your ability

43:39.740 --> 43:42.140
 to navigate everyday life.

43:43.000 --> 43:48.000
 It has been said that life is one long intelligence test.

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
 And who can't relate to that?

43:55.400 --> 43:58.440
 And if you doubt, see, another problem here

43:58.440 --> 44:00.800
 is a lot of critics of intelligence research,

44:00.800 --> 44:04.000
 intelligence testing, tend to be academics

44:04.000 --> 44:07.240
 who, by and large, are pretty smart people.

44:07.240 --> 44:10.040
 And pretty smart people, by and large,

44:10.040 --> 44:12.900
 have enormous difficulty understanding

44:12.900 --> 44:17.900
 what the world is like for people with IQs of 80 or 75.

44:18.960 --> 44:23.040
 It is a completely different everyday experience.

44:23.040 --> 44:27.900
 Even IQ scores of 85, 90.

44:27.900 --> 44:32.040
 You know, there's a popular television program, Judge Judy.

44:32.040 --> 44:35.340
 Judge Judy deals with everyday people

44:35.340 --> 44:39.440
 with everyday problems, and you can see the full range

44:39.440 --> 44:43.240
 of problem solving ability demonstrated there.

44:43.240 --> 44:45.300
 And sometimes she does it for laughs,

44:45.300 --> 44:50.300
 but it really isn't funny because people who are,

44:52.460 --> 44:54.500
 there are people who are very limited

44:54.500 --> 44:59.160
 in their life navigation, let alone success,

45:00.040 --> 45:05.040
 by not having good reasoning skills, which cannot be taught.

45:05.040 --> 45:07.720
 We know this, by the way, because there are many efforts.

45:07.720 --> 45:09.320
 You know, the United States military,

45:09.320 --> 45:12.160
 which excels at training people,

45:12.160 --> 45:14.560
 I mean, I don't know that there's a better organization

45:14.560 --> 45:18.360
 in the world for training diverse people,

45:18.360 --> 45:20.760
 and they won't take people with IQs under,

45:20.760 --> 45:24.960
 I think, 83 is the cutoff, because they have found

45:24.960 --> 45:29.960
 they are unable to train people with lower IQs

45:30.520 --> 45:32.520
 to do jobs in the military.

45:32.520 --> 45:35.720
 So one of the things that G Factor has to do is learning.

45:35.720 --> 45:40.720
 Absolutely, some people learn faster than others.

45:40.720 --> 45:43.520
 Some people learn more than others.

45:43.520 --> 45:46.320
 Now, faster, by the way, is not necessarily better,

45:47.320 --> 45:49.920
 as long as you get to the same place eventually.

45:51.720 --> 45:54.320
 But, you know, there are professional schools

45:54.320 --> 45:57.640
 that want students who can learn the fastest

45:57.640 --> 46:01.520
 because they can learn more or learn better.

46:01.520 --> 46:06.520
 Or learn deeper, or all kinds of ideas

46:06.880 --> 46:09.560
 about why you select people with the highest scores.

46:09.560 --> 46:12.640
 And there's nothing funnier, by the way,

46:12.640 --> 46:15.120
 to listen to a bunch of academics

46:15.120 --> 46:17.680
 complain about the concept of intelligence

46:17.680 --> 46:20.120
 and intelligence testing, and then you go

46:20.120 --> 46:22.480
 to a faculty meeting where they're discussing

46:22.480 --> 46:24.760
 who to hire among the applicants.

46:24.760 --> 46:27.320
 And all they talk about is how smart the person is.

46:28.400 --> 46:31.200
 We'll get to that, we'll sneak up to that in different ways,

46:31.200 --> 46:33.000
 but there's something about reducing a person

46:33.000 --> 46:35.280
 to a number that in part is grounded

46:35.280 --> 46:38.800
 to the person's genetics that makes people very uncomfortable.

46:38.800 --> 46:40.480
 But nobody does that.

46:40.480 --> 46:43.760
 Nobody in the field actually does that.

46:43.760 --> 46:48.760
 That is a worry that is a worry like,

46:54.040 --> 46:55.880
 well, I don't wanna call it a conspiracy theory.

46:55.880 --> 46:58.360
 I mean, it's a legitimate worry,

46:58.360 --> 47:01.400
 but it just doesn't happen.

47:01.400 --> 47:03.600
 Now, I had a professor in graduate school

47:03.600 --> 47:05.880
 who was the only person I ever knew

47:05.880 --> 47:10.880
 who considered the students only by their test scores.

47:12.680 --> 47:16.360
 And later in his life, he kind of backed off that.

47:19.480 --> 47:21.560
 Let me ask you this, so we'll jump around,

47:21.560 --> 47:26.560
 I'll come back to it, but I tend to,

47:26.560 --> 47:29.520
 I've had like political discussions with people

47:29.520 --> 47:34.520
 and actually my friend Michael Malice, he's an anarchist.

47:36.240 --> 47:39.200
 I disagree with him on basically everything

47:39.200 --> 47:44.200
 except the fact that love is a beautiful thing in this world.

47:47.360 --> 47:50.600
 And he says this test about left versus right,

47:50.600 --> 47:52.280
 whatever, it doesn't matter what the test is,

47:52.280 --> 47:54.920
 but he believes, the question is,

47:54.920 --> 47:57.900
 do you believe that some people are better than others?

48:00.360 --> 48:03.880
 Question is ambiguous.

48:03.880 --> 48:06.120
 Do you believe some people are better than others?

48:06.120 --> 48:10.720
 And to me, sort of the immediate answer is no.

48:11.720 --> 48:15.680
 It's a poetic question, it's an ambiguous question, right?

48:15.680 --> 48:19.520
 Like people wanna maybe the temptation

48:19.520 --> 48:23.440
 to ask better at what, better at like sports and so on.

48:23.440 --> 48:28.440
 No, to me, I stand with the sort of defining documents

48:28.440 --> 48:32.280
 of this country, which is all men are created equal.

48:32.280 --> 48:34.320
 There's a basic humanity.

48:34.320 --> 48:39.320
 And there's something about tests of intelligence.

48:39.840 --> 48:43.380
 Just knowing that some people are different,

48:43.380 --> 48:45.400
 like the science of intelligence that shows

48:45.400 --> 48:47.380
 that some people are genetically

48:49.200 --> 48:52.400
 in some stable way across a lifetime,

48:52.400 --> 48:56.160
 have a greater intelligence than others,

48:56.160 --> 49:01.160
 makes people feel like some people are better than others.

49:01.200 --> 49:03.600
 And that makes them very uncomfortable.

49:03.600 --> 49:06.960
 And I, maybe you can speak to that.

49:06.960 --> 49:09.560
 The fact that some people are more intelligent than others

49:09.560 --> 49:14.560
 in a way that's, cannot be compensated

49:14.560 --> 49:19.560
 through education, through anything you do in life.

49:22.600 --> 49:24.480
 What do we do with that?

49:24.480 --> 49:25.900
 Okay, there's a lot there.

49:26.800 --> 49:29.960
 We haven't really talked about the genetics of it yet.

49:29.960 --> 49:34.960
 But you are correct in that it is my interpretation

49:35.240 --> 49:39.720
 of the data that genetics has a very important influence

49:39.720 --> 49:41.380
 on the G factor.

49:41.380 --> 49:44.440
 And this is controversial, and we can talk about it,

49:44.440 --> 49:47.040
 but if you think that genetics,

49:47.040 --> 49:50.800
 that genes are deterministic, are always deterministic,

49:50.800 --> 49:54.080
 that leads to kind of the worry that you expressed.

49:55.320 --> 49:58.600
 But we know now in the 21st century

49:58.600 --> 50:00.920
 that many genes are not deterministic,

50:00.920 --> 50:02.800
 that are probabilistic,

50:02.800 --> 50:07.800
 meaning their gene expression can be influenced.

50:09.880 --> 50:11.320
 Now, whether they're influenced only

50:11.320 --> 50:16.320
 by other biological variables or other genetic variables

50:16.440 --> 50:19.160
 or environmental or cultural variables,

50:19.160 --> 50:21.760
 that's where the controversy comes in.

50:23.040 --> 50:27.200
 And we can discuss that in more detail if you like.

50:27.200 --> 50:31.700
 But to go to the question about better, are people better?

50:31.700 --> 50:36.700
 There's zero evidence that smart people are better

50:36.700 --> 50:41.700
 with respect to important aspects of life,

50:43.300 --> 50:47.460
 like honesty, even likability.

50:47.460 --> 50:50.340
 I'm sure you know many very intelligent people

50:50.340 --> 50:53.420
 who are not terribly likable or terribly kind

50:53.420 --> 50:55.480
 or terribly honest.

50:55.480 --> 50:56.760
 Is there something to be said?

50:56.760 --> 50:59.820
 So one of the things I've recently reread

50:59.820 --> 51:03.860
 for the second time, I guess that's what the word reread

51:03.860 --> 51:08.860
 means, the rise and fall of the Third Reich,

51:08.980 --> 51:12.060
 which is, I think, the best telling

51:12.060 --> 51:14.700
 of the rise and fall of Hitler.

51:14.700 --> 51:18.640
 And one of the interesting things about the people that,

51:20.900 --> 51:22.160
 how should I say it?

51:27.260 --> 51:32.260
 Justified or maybe propped up the ideas

51:32.260 --> 51:35.940
 that Hitler put forward is the fact

51:35.940 --> 51:38.460
 that they were extremely intelligent.

51:38.460 --> 51:40.600
 They were the intellectual class.

51:41.780 --> 51:46.260
 They were like, it was obvious that they thought

51:46.260 --> 51:49.540
 very deeply and rationally about the world.

51:49.540 --> 51:52.660
 So what I would like to say is one of the things

51:52.660 --> 51:56.100
 that shows to me is some of the worst atrocities

51:56.100 --> 51:58.860
 in the history of humanity have been committed

51:58.860 --> 52:00.780
 by very intelligent people.

52:00.780 --> 52:04.620
 So that means that intelligence

52:04.620 --> 52:06.420
 doesn't make you a good person.

52:06.420 --> 52:11.420
 I wonder if there's a G factor for intelligence.

52:12.820 --> 52:15.260
 I wonder if there's a G factor for goodness.

52:16.860 --> 52:19.180
 The Nietzschean good and evil,

52:19.180 --> 52:21.740
 of course that's probably harder to measure

52:21.740 --> 52:23.240
 because it's such a subjective thing

52:23.240 --> 52:25.340
 what it means to be good.

52:25.340 --> 52:29.380
 And even the idea of evil is a deeply uncomfortable thing

52:29.380 --> 52:31.340
 because how do we know?

52:31.340 --> 52:33.500
 But it's independent, whatever it is,

52:33.500 --> 52:35.900
 it's independent of intelligence.

52:35.900 --> 52:37.980
 So I agree with you about that.

52:37.980 --> 52:39.340
 But let me say this.

52:39.340 --> 52:44.100
 I have also asserted my belief

52:44.100 --> 52:47.240
 that more intelligence is better than less.

52:49.220 --> 52:54.220
 That doesn't mean more intelligent people are better people

52:54.400 --> 52:55.860
 but all things being equal,

52:55.860 --> 52:58.740
 would you like to be smarter or less smart?

52:58.740 --> 53:01.260
 So if I had a pill, I have two pills.

53:01.260 --> 53:02.880
 I said, this one will make you smarter,

53:02.880 --> 53:04.500
 this one will make you dumber.

53:04.500 --> 53:06.460
 Which one would you like?

53:06.460 --> 53:07.940
 Are there any circumstances

53:07.940 --> 53:09.860
 under which you would choose to be dumber?

53:09.860 --> 53:11.560
 Well, let me ask you this.

53:11.560 --> 53:13.960
 That's a very nuanced and interesting question.

53:16.040 --> 53:18.380
 There's been books written about this, right?

53:19.680 --> 53:21.680
 Now we'll return to the hard questions,

53:21.680 --> 53:22.760
 the interesting questions,

53:22.760 --> 53:25.780
 but let me ask about human happiness.

53:25.780 --> 53:29.180
 Does intelligence lead to happiness?

53:29.180 --> 53:30.020
 No.

53:31.820 --> 53:34.980
 So, okay, so back to the pill then.

53:34.980 --> 53:38.980
 So when would you take the pill?

53:38.980 --> 53:43.980
 So you said IQ 80, 90, 100, 110,

53:44.860 --> 53:46.580
 you start going through the quartiles

53:46.580 --> 53:50.220
 and is it obvious?

53:50.220 --> 53:54.500
 Isn't there diminishing returns

53:54.500 --> 53:56.500
 and then it starts becoming negative?

53:57.420 --> 53:59.280
 This is an empirical question.

54:00.420 --> 54:05.420
 And so that I have advocated in many forums

54:06.160 --> 54:11.160
 more research on enhancing the G factor.

54:11.820 --> 54:14.420
 Right now there have been many claims

54:14.420 --> 54:17.320
 about enhancing intelligence with,

54:17.320 --> 54:19.100
 you mentioned the NBAC training,

54:19.100 --> 54:22.640
 it was a big deal a few years ago, it doesn't work.

54:22.640 --> 54:25.740
 Data is very clear, it does not work.

54:25.740 --> 54:28.580
 Or doing like memory tests, like training and so on.

54:28.580 --> 54:32.700
 Yeah, it may give you a better memory in the short run,

54:32.700 --> 54:35.440
 but it doesn't impact your G factor.

54:38.140 --> 54:40.940
 It was very popular a couple of decades ago

54:40.940 --> 54:44.560
 that the idea that listening to Mozart

54:44.560 --> 54:46.580
 could make you more intelligent.

54:46.580 --> 54:48.180
 There was a paper published on this

54:48.180 --> 54:50.300
 with somebody I knew published this paper,

54:50.300 --> 54:54.660
 and intelligence researchers never believed it for a second.

54:54.660 --> 54:57.820
 Been hundreds of studies, all the meta analyses,

54:57.820 --> 54:59.420
 all the summaries and so on,

54:59.420 --> 55:04.080
 show that there's nothing to it, nothing to it at all.

55:05.900 --> 55:08.780
 But wouldn't it be something,

55:08.780 --> 55:11.840
 wouldn't it be world shaking

55:12.820 --> 55:15.940
 if you could take the normal distribution of intelligence,

55:15.940 --> 55:17.500
 which we haven't really talked about yet,

55:17.500 --> 55:20.400
 but IQ scores and the G factor

55:20.400 --> 55:22.760
 is thought to be a normal distribution,

55:23.940 --> 55:28.940
 and shift it to the right so that everybody is smarter?

55:30.140 --> 55:34.400
 Even a half a standard deviation would be world shaking,

55:35.340 --> 55:38.700
 because there are many social problems,

55:38.700 --> 55:43.260
 many, many social problems that are exacerbated

55:43.260 --> 55:48.260
 by people with lower ability to reason stuff out

55:48.700 --> 55:50.620
 and navigate everyday life.

55:51.860 --> 55:52.700
 So.

55:52.700 --> 55:53.780
 I wonder if there's a threshold.

55:53.780 --> 55:58.780
 So maybe I would push back and say universal shifting

55:59.420 --> 56:02.240
 of the normal distribution

56:02.240 --> 56:05.060
 may not be the optimal way of shifting.

56:05.060 --> 56:07.340
 Maybe it's better to,

56:07.340 --> 56:10.620
 whatever the asymmetric kind of distributions

56:10.620 --> 56:13.380
 is like really pushing the lower up

56:13.380 --> 56:17.580
 versus trying to make the people

56:17.580 --> 56:19.660
 at the average more intelligent.

56:19.660 --> 56:21.060
 So you're saying that if in fact

56:21.060 --> 56:23.540
 there was some way to increase G,

56:23.540 --> 56:27.800
 let's just call it metaphorically a pill, an IQ pill,

56:27.800 --> 56:30.580
 we should only give it to people at the lower end.

56:30.580 --> 56:34.940
 No, it's just intuitively I can see

56:34.940 --> 56:39.820
 that life becomes easier at the lower end if it's increased.

56:39.820 --> 56:41.820
 It becomes less and less,

56:41.820 --> 56:43.580
 it is an empirical scientific question,

56:43.580 --> 56:46.180
 but it becomes less and less obvious to me

56:46.180 --> 56:50.500
 that more intelligence is better.

56:50.500 --> 56:55.500
 At the high end, not because it would make life easier,

56:56.500 --> 57:00.980
 but it would make whatever problems you're working on

57:00.980 --> 57:02.700
 more solvable.

57:02.700 --> 57:06.740
 And if you are working on artificial intelligence,

57:06.740 --> 57:11.740
 there's a tremendous potential for that to improve society.

57:13.300 --> 57:14.580
 I understand.

57:14.580 --> 57:19.000
 So at whatever problems you're working on, yes.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.720
 But there's also the problem of the human condition.

57:21.720 --> 57:24.340
 There's love, there's fear,

57:24.340 --> 57:26.700
 and all of those beautiful things

57:26.700 --> 57:29.860
 that sometimes if you're good at solving problems,

57:29.860 --> 57:32.100
 you're going to create more problems for yourself.

57:32.100 --> 57:34.460
 It's, I'm not exactly sure.

57:34.460 --> 57:37.220
 So ignorance is bliss is a thing.

57:37.220 --> 57:38.400
 So there might be a place,

57:38.400 --> 57:40.960
 there might be a sweet spot of intelligence

57:40.960 --> 57:43.680
 given your environment, given your personality,

57:43.680 --> 57:45.060
 all of those kinds of things.

57:45.060 --> 57:48.140
 And that becomes less beautifully complicated

57:48.140 --> 57:50.500
 the more and more intelligent you become.

57:50.500 --> 57:53.160
 But that's a question for literature,

57:53.160 --> 57:54.700
 not for science perhaps.

57:54.700 --> 57:56.180
 Well, imagine this.

57:56.180 --> 57:58.380
 Imagine there was an IQ pill

57:58.380 --> 58:01.580
 and it was developed by a private company

58:01.580 --> 58:05.060
 and they are willing to sell it to you.

58:05.060 --> 58:07.900
 And whatever price they put on it,

58:07.900 --> 58:09.500
 you are willing to pay it

58:09.500 --> 58:11.780
 because you would like to be smarter.

58:11.780 --> 58:14.360
 But just before they give you a pill,

58:14.360 --> 58:18.380
 they give you a disclaimer form to sign.

58:18.380 --> 58:20.020
 Yes.

58:20.020 --> 58:21.060
 Don't hold us,

58:22.620 --> 58:25.180
 you understand that this pill has no guarantee

58:25.180 --> 58:26.980
 that your life is going to be better

58:26.980 --> 58:28.920
 and in fact it could be worse.

58:28.920 --> 58:32.200
 Well, yes, that's how lawyers work.

58:32.200 --> 58:35.160
 But I would love for science to answer the question

58:35.160 --> 58:36.640
 to try to predict if your life

58:36.640 --> 58:38.680
 is going to be better or worse

58:38.680 --> 58:41.200
 when you become more or less intelligent.

58:41.200 --> 58:43.260
 It's a fascinating question

58:43.260 --> 58:45.920
 about what is the sweet spot for the human condition.

58:47.600 --> 58:49.820
 Some of the things we see as bugs

58:49.820 --> 58:51.900
 might be actually features,

58:51.900 --> 58:55.360
 may be crucial to our overall happiness

58:55.360 --> 58:59.120
 as our limitations might lead to more happiness than less.

58:59.120 --> 59:02.720
 But again, more intelligence is better at the lower end.

59:02.720 --> 59:06.480
 That's more, that's something that's less arguable

59:06.480 --> 59:10.080
 and fascinating if possible to increase.

59:10.080 --> 59:12.960
 But you know, there's virtually no research

59:12.960 --> 59:15.320
 that's based on a neuroscience approach

59:15.320 --> 59:17.520
 to solving that problem.

59:17.520 --> 59:20.800
 All the solutions that have been proposed

59:20.800 --> 59:25.400
 to solve that problem or to ameliorate that problem

59:25.400 --> 59:29.680
 are essentially based on the blank slate assumption

59:29.680 --> 59:34.680
 that enriching the environment, removing barriers,

59:34.680 --> 59:36.000
 all good things by the way,

59:36.000 --> 59:38.160
 I'm not against any of those things.

59:38.160 --> 59:39.700
 But there's no empirical evidence

59:39.700 --> 59:44.360
 that they're going to improve the general reasoning ability

59:45.260 --> 59:47.920
 or make people more employable.

59:47.920 --> 59:50.680
 Have you read Flowers of Algernon? Yes.

59:51.840 --> 59:54.680
 That's to the question of intelligence and happiness.

59:56.240 --> 59:59.440
 There are many profound aspects of that story.

59:59.440 --> 1:00:01.840
 It was a film that was very good.

1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:04.800
 The film was called Charlie

1:00:04.800 --> 1:00:07.500
 for the younger people who are listening to this.

1:00:08.680 --> 1:00:11.780
 You might be able to stream it on Netflix or something,

1:00:11.780 --> 1:00:16.780
 but it was a story about a person

1:00:16.780 --> 1:00:20.620
 with very low IQ who underwent a surgical procedure

1:00:20.620 --> 1:00:23.780
 in the brain and he slowly became a genius.

1:00:24.860 --> 1:00:29.480
 And the tragedy of the story is the effect was temporary.

1:00:31.180 --> 1:00:33.120
 It's a fascinating story really.

1:00:33.120 --> 1:00:36.580
 That goes in contrast to the basic human experience

1:00:36.580 --> 1:00:38.420
 that each of us individually have,

1:00:38.420 --> 1:00:43.420
 but it raises the question of the full range of people

1:00:43.420 --> 1:00:47.700
 you might be able to be given different levels

1:00:47.700 --> 1:00:48.780
 of intelligence.

1:00:48.780 --> 1:00:51.920
 You've mentioned the normal distribution.

1:00:52.920 --> 1:00:54.520
 So let's talk about it.

1:00:54.520 --> 1:00:58.360
 There's a book called The Bell Curve written in 1994,

1:00:58.360 --> 1:01:01.340
 written by psychologist Richard Herrnstein

1:01:01.340 --> 1:01:04.500
 and political scientist Charles Murray.

1:01:04.500 --> 1:01:07.140
 Why was this book so controversial?

1:01:08.540 --> 1:01:10.720
 This is a fascinating book.

1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:12.620
 I know Charles Murray.

1:01:12.620 --> 1:01:15.340
 I've had many conversations with him.

1:01:15.340 --> 1:01:16.660
 Yeah, what is the book about?

1:01:16.660 --> 1:01:21.660
 The book is about the importance of intelligence

1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:24.160
 in everyday life.

1:01:25.420 --> 1:01:27.520
 That's what the book is about.

1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:29.220
 It's an empirical book.

1:01:29.220 --> 1:01:34.180
 It has statistical analyses of very large databases

1:01:34.180 --> 1:01:39.180
 that show that essentially IQ scores or their equivalent

1:01:39.180 --> 1:01:44.180
 are correlated to all kinds of social problems

1:01:44.640 --> 1:01:46.800
 and social benefits.

1:01:46.800 --> 1:01:51.740
 And that in itself is not where the controversy

1:01:51.740 --> 1:01:53.640
 about that book came.

1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:57.600
 The controversy was about one chapter in that book.

1:01:57.600 --> 1:02:02.240
 And that is a chapter about the average difference

1:02:02.240 --> 1:02:06.720
 in mean scores between black Americans and white Americans.

1:02:06.720 --> 1:02:08.960
 And these are the terms that were used in the book

1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:12.260
 at the time and are still used to some extent.

1:02:14.080 --> 1:02:19.080
 And historically, or really for decades,

1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:26.240
 it has been observed that disadvantaged groups

1:02:28.020 --> 1:02:32.920
 score on average lower than Caucasians

1:02:35.480 --> 1:02:38.280
 on academic tests, tests of mental ability,

1:02:38.280 --> 1:02:40.440
 and especially on IQ tests.

1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:43.120
 And the difference is about a standard deviation,

1:02:43.120 --> 1:02:46.620
 which is about 15 points, which is a substantial difference.

1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:53.920
 In the book, Herrnstein and Murray in this one chapter

1:02:54.160 --> 1:02:58.260
 assert clearly and unambiguously

1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:01.960
 that whether this average difference

1:03:01.960 --> 1:03:06.960
 is due to genetics or not, they are agnostic.

1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:08.280
 They don't know.

1:03:08.280 --> 1:03:11.160
 Moreover, they assert they don't care

1:03:11.160 --> 1:03:13.880
 because you wouldn't treat anybody differently

1:03:13.880 --> 1:03:17.640
 knowing if there was a genetic component or not

1:03:17.640 --> 1:03:20.560
 because that's a group average finding.

1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:23.960
 Every individual has to be treated as an individual.

1:03:23.960 --> 1:03:26.040
 You can't make any assumption

1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:30.640
 about what that person's intellectual ability might be

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:33.160
 from the fact of a average group difference.

1:03:33.160 --> 1:03:34.880
 They're very clear about this.

1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:39.880
 Nonetheless, people took away,

1:03:41.680 --> 1:03:43.240
 I'm gonna choose my words carefully

1:03:43.240 --> 1:03:44.800
 because I have a feeling that many critics

1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:49.160
 didn't actually read the book.

1:03:49.160 --> 1:03:51.880
 They took away that Herrnstein and Murray were saying

1:03:51.880 --> 1:03:54.960
 that blacks are genetically inferior.

1:03:54.960 --> 1:03:56.560
 That was the take home message.

1:03:56.560 --> 1:03:59.680
 And if they weren't saying it, they were implying it

1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:02.720
 because they had a chapter that discussed

1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:05.940
 this empirical observation of a difference.

1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:10.560
 And isn't this horrible?

1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:15.080
 And so the reaction to that book was incendiary.

1:04:18.400 --> 1:04:22.560
 What do we know about from that book

1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:27.560
 and the research beyond about race differences

1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:30.620
 and intelligence?

1:04:30.620 --> 1:04:33.800
 It's still the most incendiary topic in psychology.

1:04:33.800 --> 1:04:35.880
 Nothing has changed that.

1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:40.880
 Anybody who even discusses it is easily called a racist

1:04:41.200 --> 1:04:43.040
 just for discussing it.

1:04:43.040 --> 1:04:45.560
 It's become fashionable to find racism

1:04:45.560 --> 1:04:49.960
 in any discussion like this.

1:04:49.960 --> 1:04:51.340
 It's unfortunate.

1:04:53.560 --> 1:04:56.040
 The short answer to your question is

1:04:57.080 --> 1:05:00.160
 there's been very little actual research

1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:03.840
 on this topic since 19...

1:05:03.840 --> 1:05:05.200
 Since the bell curve.

1:05:05.200 --> 1:05:07.920
 Since the bell curve, even before.

1:05:07.920 --> 1:05:12.460
 This really became incendiary in 1969

1:05:12.460 --> 1:05:15.760
 with an article published by an educational psychologist

1:05:15.760 --> 1:05:17.760
 named Arthur Jensen.

1:05:17.760 --> 1:05:20.520
 Let's just take a minute and go back to that

1:05:20.520 --> 1:05:22.920
 to see the bell curve in a little bit more

1:05:22.920 --> 1:05:25.040
 historical perspective.

1:05:25.040 --> 1:05:28.160
 Arthur Jensen was a educational psychologist

1:05:28.160 --> 1:05:29.320
 at UC Berkeley.

1:05:29.320 --> 1:05:31.440
 I knew him as well.

1:05:31.440 --> 1:05:36.440
 And in 1969 or 68, the Harvard Educational Review

1:05:37.800 --> 1:05:42.640
 asked him to do a review article

1:05:42.640 --> 1:05:47.560
 on the early childhood education programs

1:05:47.560 --> 1:05:52.560
 that were designed to raise the IQs of minority students.

1:05:54.800 --> 1:05:58.560
 This was before the federally funded Head Start program.

1:05:58.560 --> 1:06:01.280
 Head Start had not really gotten underway

1:06:01.280 --> 1:06:04.440
 at the time Jensen undertook his review

1:06:04.440 --> 1:06:07.780
 of what were a number of demonstration programs.

1:06:08.640 --> 1:06:13.640
 And these demonstration programs were for young children

1:06:13.920 --> 1:06:15.720
 who were around kindergarten age.

1:06:15.720 --> 1:06:18.200
 And they were specially designed to be

1:06:18.200 --> 1:06:23.020
 cognitively stimulating, to provide lunches,

1:06:23.020 --> 1:06:27.200
 do all the things that people thought would

1:06:27.200 --> 1:06:31.800
 minimize this average gap of intelligence tests.

1:06:31.800 --> 1:06:36.800
 There was a strong belief among virtually all psychologists

1:06:37.200 --> 1:06:40.760
 that the cause of the gap was unequal opportunity

1:06:40.760 --> 1:06:45.600
 due to racism, due to all negative things in the society.

1:06:45.600 --> 1:06:50.600
 And if you could compensate for this, the gap would go away.

1:06:51.200 --> 1:06:54.740
 So early childhood education back then was called

1:06:54.740 --> 1:06:57.280
 literally compensatory education.

1:06:58.640 --> 1:07:00.920
 Jensen looked at these programs.

1:07:00.920 --> 1:07:02.200
 He was an empirical guy.

1:07:02.200 --> 1:07:04.600
 He understood psychometrics.

1:07:04.600 --> 1:07:08.800
 And he wrote a, it was over a hundred page article

1:07:08.800 --> 1:07:12.120
 detailing these programs

1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:15.360
 and the flaws in their research design.

1:07:15.360 --> 1:07:17.640
 Some of the programs reported IQ gains

1:07:17.640 --> 1:07:20.400
 of on average five points,

1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:24.720
 but a few reported 10, 20 and even 30 point gains.

1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:28.000
 One was called the miracle in Milwaukee.

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:30.440
 That investigator went to jail ultimately

1:07:30.440 --> 1:07:32.100
 for fabricating data.

1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:36.000
 But the point is that Jensen wrote an article that said,

1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:40.000
 look, the opening sentence of his article is classic.

1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:43.520
 The opening sentence is, I may not quote it exactly right,

1:07:43.520 --> 1:07:47.120
 but it's, we have tried compensatory education

1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:48.420
 and it has failed.

1:07:48.420 --> 1:07:53.420
 And he showed that these gains were essentially nothing.

1:07:54.140 --> 1:07:58.660
 You couldn't really document empirically any gains at all

1:07:58.660 --> 1:08:03.340
 from these really earnest efforts to increase IQ.

1:08:03.340 --> 1:08:08.060
 But he went a step further, a fateful step further.

1:08:08.060 --> 1:08:11.740
 He said, not only have these efforts failed,

1:08:11.740 --> 1:08:15.220
 but because they have had essentially no impact,

1:08:15.220 --> 1:08:17.660
 we have to reexamine our assumption

1:08:17.660 --> 1:08:22.100
 that these differences are caused by environmental things

1:08:22.100 --> 1:08:24.420
 that we can address with education.

1:08:24.420 --> 1:08:28.500
 We need to consider a genetic influence,

1:08:28.500 --> 1:08:30.580
 whether there's a genetic influence

1:08:30.580 --> 1:08:32.420
 on this group difference.

1:08:32.420 --> 1:08:36.060
 So you said that this is one of the more controversial works

1:08:36.060 --> 1:08:37.900
 ever in science. I think it's the most infamous paper

1:08:37.900 --> 1:08:41.680
 in all of psychology, I would go on to say.

1:08:41.680 --> 1:08:46.680
 Because in 1969, the genetic data was very skimpy

1:08:46.680 --> 1:08:49.640
 on this question, skimpy and controversial.

1:08:49.640 --> 1:08:50.820
 It's always been controversial,

1:08:50.820 --> 1:08:53.820
 but it was even skimpy and controversial.

1:08:53.820 --> 1:08:56.480
 It's kind of a long story that I go into a little bit

1:08:56.480 --> 1:09:00.900
 in more detail in the book, Neuroscience of Intelligence.

1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:06.320
 But to say he was vilified is an understatement.

1:09:06.320 --> 1:09:08.880
 I mean, he couldn't talk at the American

1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:13.140
 Psychological Association without bomb threats

1:09:13.140 --> 1:09:15.240
 clearing the lecture hall.

1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:18.120
 Campus security watched him all the time.

1:09:18.120 --> 1:09:19.420
 They opened his mail.

1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:23.720
 He had to retreat to a different address.

1:09:24.680 --> 1:09:28.760
 This was one of the earliest kinds,

1:09:28.760 --> 1:09:30.500
 this is before the internet

1:09:30.500 --> 1:09:35.080
 and kind of internet social media mobs.

1:09:35.080 --> 1:09:38.120
 But it was that intense.

1:09:38.120 --> 1:09:42.740
 And I have written that overnight,

1:09:42.740 --> 1:09:45.960
 after the publication of this article,

1:09:45.960 --> 1:09:49.760
 all intelligence research became radioactive.

1:09:49.760 --> 1:09:51.820
 Nobody wanted to talk about it.

1:09:56.200 --> 1:09:58.920
 Nobody was doing more research.

1:09:58.920 --> 1:10:02.080
 And then the bell curve came along.

1:10:02.080 --> 1:10:05.720
 And the Jensen controversy was dying down.

1:10:05.720 --> 1:10:08.960
 I have stories that Jensen told me about his interaction

1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:10.920
 with the Nixon White House on this issue.

1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:14.360
 I mean, this was like a really big deal.

1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:16.160
 It was some unbelievable stories,

1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:20.100
 but he told me this, so I kind of believe these stories.

1:10:20.100 --> 1:10:21.640
 Nonetheless.

1:10:21.640 --> 1:10:22.920
 25 years later.

1:10:22.920 --> 1:10:24.240
 25 years later.

1:10:24.240 --> 1:10:27.080
 All this silence, basically, saying,

1:10:30.040 --> 1:10:32.280
 nobody wants to do this kind of research.

1:10:32.280 --> 1:10:34.620
 There's so much pressure, so much attack

1:10:34.620 --> 1:10:36.360
 against this kind of research.

1:10:36.360 --> 1:10:41.360
 And here's sort of a bold, stupid, crazy people

1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:44.880
 that decide to dive right back in.

1:10:44.880 --> 1:10:46.520
 I wonder how much discussion that was.

1:10:46.520 --> 1:10:48.720
 Do we include this chapter or not?

1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:51.100
 Murray has said they discussed it,

1:10:51.100 --> 1:10:54.680
 and they felt they should include it.

1:10:55.640 --> 1:10:59.580
 And they were very careful in the way they wrote it,

1:10:59.580 --> 1:11:01.040
 which did them no good.

1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:06.040
 So, as a matter of fact, when the bell curve came out,

1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:08.480
 it was so controversial.

1:11:08.480 --> 1:11:13.320
 I got a call from a television show called Nightline.

1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:16.840
 It was with a broadcaster called Ted Koppel.

1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:20.600
 We had this evening show, I think it was on late at night.

1:11:20.600 --> 1:11:21.600
 Talked about news.

1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:24.240
 It was a straight up news thing.

1:11:24.240 --> 1:11:28.200
 And a producer called and asked if I would be on it

1:11:28.200 --> 1:11:31.680
 to talk about the bell curve.

1:11:31.680 --> 1:11:35.000
 And I said, she asked me what I thought

1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:36.640
 about the bell curve as a book.

1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:38.560
 And I said, look, it's a very good book.

1:11:38.560 --> 1:11:43.080
 It talks about the role of intelligence in society.

1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:44.980
 And she said, no, no, what do you think

1:11:44.980 --> 1:11:47.160
 about the chapter on race?

1:11:47.160 --> 1:11:49.080
 That's what we want you to talk about.

1:11:49.940 --> 1:11:52.400
 I remember this conversation.

1:11:52.400 --> 1:11:56.600
 I said, well, she said, what would you say

1:11:56.600 --> 1:11:58.800
 if you were on TV?

1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:02.240
 And I said, well, what I would say is that

1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:07.240
 it's not at all clear if there's any genetic component

1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:12.760
 to intelligence, any differences.

1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:17.440
 But if there were a strong genetic component,

1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:19.020
 that would be a good thing.

1:12:21.140 --> 1:12:25.280
 And complete silence on the other end of the phone.

1:12:25.280 --> 1:12:27.320
 And she said, well, what do you mean?

1:12:28.180 --> 1:12:31.160
 And I said, well, if it's the more genetic

1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:35.080
 any difference is, the more it's biological.

1:12:35.080 --> 1:12:39.960
 And if it's biological, we can figure out how to fix it.

1:12:39.960 --> 1:12:41.480
 I see, that's interesting.

1:12:41.480 --> 1:12:43.680
 She said, would you say that on television?

1:12:43.680 --> 1:12:44.520
 Yes.

1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:45.340
 And I said, no.

1:12:45.340 --> 1:12:47.400
 And so that was the end of that.

1:12:47.400 --> 1:12:56.400
 So that's for more like biology is within the reach

1:12:56.400 --> 1:13:01.400
 of science and the environment is a public policy,

1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:04.080
 is social and all those kinds of things.

1:13:05.500 --> 1:13:09.120
 From your perspective, whichever one you think

1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:11.760
 is more amenable to solutions in the short term

1:13:11.760 --> 1:13:13.560
 is the one that excites you.

1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:22.560
 But you saying that is good, the truth of genetic differences,

1:13:22.900 --> 1:13:32.560
 no matter what, between groups is a painful, harmful,

1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:35.320
 potentially dangerous thing.

1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:38.080
 So let me ask you to this question,

1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:40.160
 whether it's bell curve or any research

1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:47.080
 on race differences, can that be used to increase

1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:49.400
 the amount of racism in the world?

1:13:49.400 --> 1:13:51.680
 Can that be used to increase the amount of hate

1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:52.820
 in the world?

1:13:52.820 --> 1:13:54.400
 Do you think about this kind of stuff?

1:13:54.400 --> 1:13:57.400
 I've thought about this a lot, not as a scientist,

1:13:57.400 --> 1:13:58.540
 but as a person.

1:14:00.680 --> 1:14:05.680
 And my sense is there is such enormous reservoirs

1:14:05.680 --> 1:14:10.680
 of hate and racism that have nothing to do

1:14:13.040 --> 1:14:16.600
 with scientific knowledge of the data,

1:14:16.600 --> 1:14:19.200
 that speak against that.

1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:24.200
 That no, I don't wanna give racist groups a veto power

1:14:25.360 --> 1:14:27.680
 over what scientists study.

1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:31.440
 If you think that the differences, and by the way,

1:14:31.440 --> 1:14:34.360
 virtually no one disagrees that there are differences

1:14:34.360 --> 1:14:37.200
 in scores, it's all about what causes them

1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:39.400
 and how to fix it.

1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:42.920
 So if you think this is a cultural problem,

1:14:42.920 --> 1:14:44.840
 then you must ask the problem,

1:14:44.840 --> 1:14:49.360
 what do you want to change anything about the culture?

1:14:49.360 --> 1:14:51.800
 Or are you okay with the culture?

1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:53.380
 Cause you don't feel it's appropriate

1:14:53.380 --> 1:14:55.600
 to change a person's culture.

1:14:55.600 --> 1:14:57.160
 So are you okay with that?

1:14:57.160 --> 1:14:59.720
 And the fact that that may lead to disadvantages

1:14:59.720 --> 1:15:01.600
 in school achievement.

1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:02.500
 It's a question.

1:15:02.500 --> 1:15:05.940
 If you think it's environmental,

1:15:05.940 --> 1:15:10.380
 what are the environmental parameters that can be fixed?

1:15:10.380 --> 1:15:15.380
 I'll tell you one, lead from gasoline in the atmosphere.

1:15:15.860 --> 1:15:18.780
 Lead in paint, lead in water.

1:15:18.780 --> 1:15:22.340
 That's an environmental toxin that society

1:15:22.340 --> 1:15:25.980
 has the means to eliminate, and they should.

1:15:25.980 --> 1:15:30.260
 Yeah, just to sort of try and define some insights

1:15:30.260 --> 1:15:32.600
 and conclusion to this very difficult topic.

1:15:33.860 --> 1:15:38.740
 Is there been research on environment versus genetics,

1:15:38.740 --> 1:15:40.420
 nature versus nurture, on this question

1:15:40.420 --> 1:15:41.580
 of race differences?

1:15:43.100 --> 1:15:46.380
 There is not, no one wants to do this research.

1:15:46.380 --> 1:15:48.080
 First of all, it's hard research to do.

1:15:48.080 --> 1:15:50.620
 Second of all, it's a minefield.

1:15:50.620 --> 1:15:52.940
 No one wants to spend their career on it.

1:15:52.940 --> 1:15:56.320
 Tenured people don't want to do it, let alone students.

1:15:56.320 --> 1:15:59.600
 The way I talk about it,

1:16:00.600 --> 1:16:02.440
 well, before I tell you the way I talk about it,

1:16:02.440 --> 1:16:04.560
 I want to say one more thing about Jensen.

1:16:05.640 --> 1:16:08.120
 He was once asked by a journalist straight out,

1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:09.400
 are you a racist?

1:16:10.480 --> 1:16:12.520
 His answer was very interesting.

1:16:12.520 --> 1:16:15.800
 His answer was, I've thought about that a lot,

1:16:16.960 --> 1:16:19.560
 and I've concluded it doesn't matter.

1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:23.640
 Now, I know what he meant by this.

1:16:23.640 --> 1:16:25.840
 The guts to say that, wow.

1:16:25.840 --> 1:16:27.560
 He was a very unusual person.

1:16:27.560 --> 1:16:29.920
 I think he had a touch of Asperger's syndrome,

1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:30.940
 to tell you the truth,

1:16:30.940 --> 1:16:34.160
 because I saw him in many circumstances.

1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:36.140
 He would be canceled on Twitter immediately

1:16:36.140 --> 1:16:37.520
 with that sentence.

1:16:37.520 --> 1:16:41.060
 But what he meant was he had a hypothesis,

1:16:42.440 --> 1:16:44.920
 and with respect to group differences,

1:16:44.920 --> 1:16:47.400
 he called it the default hypothesis.

1:16:47.400 --> 1:16:51.240
 He said, whatever factors affect individual intelligence

1:16:51.240 --> 1:16:54.320
 are likely the same factors that affect group differences.

1:16:54.320 --> 1:16:55.600
 It was the default.

1:16:55.600 --> 1:16:58.280
 But it was a hypothesis.

1:16:58.280 --> 1:17:01.040
 It should be tested, and if it turned out

1:17:01.040 --> 1:17:03.680
 empirical tests didn't support the hypothesis,

1:17:03.680 --> 1:17:06.480
 he was happy to move on to something else.

1:17:06.480 --> 1:17:11.480
 He was absolutely committed to that scientific ideal,

1:17:12.480 --> 1:17:16.040
 that it's an empirical question,

1:17:16.040 --> 1:17:18.800
 we should look at it, and let's see what happens.

1:17:18.800 --> 1:17:22.080
 The scientific method cannot be racist,

1:17:22.080 --> 1:17:23.480
 from his perspective.

1:17:23.480 --> 1:17:26.240
 It doesn't matter what the scientists,

1:17:26.240 --> 1:17:30.440
 if they follow the scientific method,

1:17:30.440 --> 1:17:32.080
 it doesn't matter what they believe.

1:17:32.080 --> 1:17:35.520
 And if they are biased, and they consciously

1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:39.520
 or unconsciously bias the data,

1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:42.680
 other people will come along to replicate it,

1:17:42.680 --> 1:17:47.680
 they will fail, and the process over time will work.

1:17:48.200 --> 1:17:50.980
 So let me push back on this idea.

1:17:50.980 --> 1:17:55.980
 Because psychology to me is full of gray areas.

1:17:57.380 --> 1:18:01.460
 And what I've observed about psychology,

1:18:01.460 --> 1:18:04.060
 even replication crisis aside,

1:18:04.060 --> 1:18:06.220
 is that something about the media,

1:18:06.220 --> 1:18:08.020
 something about journalism,

1:18:08.020 --> 1:18:13.020
 something about the virality of ideas in the public sphere,

1:18:13.700 --> 1:18:18.360
 they misinterpret, they take up things from studies,

1:18:18.360 --> 1:18:23.360
 willfully or from ignorance, misinterpret findings,

1:18:23.640 --> 1:18:25.720
 and tell narratives around that.

1:18:27.120 --> 1:18:29.820
 I personally believe, for me,

1:18:29.820 --> 1:18:31.520
 I'm not saying that broadly about science,

1:18:31.520 --> 1:18:35.760
 but for me, it's my responsibility to anticipate

1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:40.420
 the ways in which findings will be misinterpreted.

1:18:40.420 --> 1:18:42.840
 So I thought about this a lot,

1:18:42.840 --> 1:18:47.020
 because I published papers on semi autonomous vehicles,

1:18:47.020 --> 1:18:52.020
 and those cars, people die in cars.

1:18:52.960 --> 1:18:57.200
 There's people that have written me letters saying emails,

1:18:57.200 --> 1:19:00.000
 nobody writes letters, I wish they did,

1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:01.800
 that have blood on my hands,

1:19:01.800 --> 1:19:04.800
 because of things that I would say positive or negative,

1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:06.200
 there's consequences.

1:19:06.200 --> 1:19:09.260
 In the same way, when you're a researcher of intelligence,

1:19:09.260 --> 1:19:12.040
 I'm sure you might get emails,

1:19:12.040 --> 1:19:14.500
 or at least people might believe

1:19:14.500 --> 1:19:17.920
 that a finding of your study is going to be used

1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:19.080
 by a large number of people

1:19:19.080 --> 1:19:21.280
 to increase the amount of hate in the world.

1:19:22.640 --> 1:19:26.060
 I think there's some responsibility on scientists,

1:19:26.060 --> 1:19:29.200
 but for me, I think there's a great responsibility

1:19:30.480 --> 1:19:35.400
 to anticipate the ways things will be misinterpreted,

1:19:35.400 --> 1:19:37.880
 and there, you have to, first of all,

1:19:37.880 --> 1:19:40.980
 decide whether you want to say a thing at all,

1:19:40.980 --> 1:19:43.440
 do the study at all, publish the study at all,

1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:47.160
 and two, the words with which you explain it.

1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:50.640
 I find this on Twitter a lot, actually,

1:19:50.640 --> 1:19:53.200
 which is, when I write a tweet,

1:19:53.200 --> 1:19:55.320
 and I'm usually just doing it so innocently,

1:19:58.560 --> 1:20:02.040
 I'll write it, it takes me five seconds to write it,

1:20:02.040 --> 1:20:04.320
 or whatever, 30 seconds to write it,

1:20:04.320 --> 1:20:08.240
 and then I'll think, all right, I close my eyes open,

1:20:08.240 --> 1:20:11.680
 and try to see how will the world interpret this,

1:20:11.680 --> 1:20:14.400
 what are the ways in which this will be misinterpreted,

1:20:14.400 --> 1:20:16.980
 and I'll sometimes adjust that tweet to see,

1:20:18.480 --> 1:20:20.940
 yeah, so in my mind, it's clear,

1:20:20.940 --> 1:20:24.040
 but that's because it's my mind from which this tweet came,

1:20:24.040 --> 1:20:26.900
 but you have to think, in a fresh mind that sees this,

1:20:28.160 --> 1:20:32.840
 and it's spread across a large number of other minds,

1:20:32.840 --> 1:20:36.040
 how will the interpretation morph?

1:20:36.040 --> 1:20:38.260
 I mean, for a tweet, it's a silly thing, it doesn't matter,

1:20:38.260 --> 1:20:43.260
 but for a scientific paper and study and finding,

1:20:45.640 --> 1:20:47.240
 I think it matters.

1:20:47.240 --> 1:20:49.720
 So I don't know what your thoughts are on that,

1:20:49.720 --> 1:20:53.760
 because maybe for Jensen, the data's there,

1:20:54.600 --> 1:20:55.600
 what do you want me to do?

1:20:55.600 --> 1:20:59.160
 This is a scientific process that's been carried out,

1:20:59.160 --> 1:21:02.200
 if you think the data was polluted by bias,

1:21:02.200 --> 1:21:04.640
 do other studies that reveal the bias,

1:21:05.800 --> 1:21:07.440
 but the data's there.

1:21:07.440 --> 1:21:12.440
 And I'm not a poet, I'm not a literary writer,

1:21:14.720 --> 1:21:15.640
 what do you want me to do?

1:21:15.640 --> 1:21:17.560
 I'm just presenting you the data.

1:21:17.560 --> 1:21:19.360
 What do you think on that spectrum?

1:21:19.360 --> 1:21:21.120
 What's the role of a scientist?

1:21:21.120 --> 1:21:23.540
 The reason I do podcasts,

1:21:23.540 --> 1:21:27.280
 the reason I write books for the public

1:21:27.280 --> 1:21:30.420
 is to explain what I think the data mean

1:21:30.420 --> 1:21:32.680
 and what I think the data don't mean.

1:21:32.680 --> 1:21:37.680
 I don't do very much on Twitter other than to retweet

1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:39.920
 references to papers.

1:21:39.920 --> 1:21:42.440
 I don't think it's my role to explain these,

1:21:42.440 --> 1:21:44.880
 because they're complicated, they're nuanced.

1:21:46.480 --> 1:21:51.480
 But when you decide not to do a scientific study

1:21:51.560 --> 1:21:54.360
 because you're, or not to publish a result

1:21:54.360 --> 1:21:59.360
 because you're afraid the result could be harmful

1:21:59.360 --> 1:22:04.080
 or insensitive, that's not an unreasonable thought.

1:22:05.080 --> 1:22:09.200
 And people will make different conclusions

1:22:09.200 --> 1:22:11.560
 and decisions about that.

1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:14.680
 I wrote about this, I'm the editor

1:22:14.680 --> 1:22:17.000
 of a journal called Intelligence,

1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:20.560
 which publishes scientific papers.

1:22:20.560 --> 1:22:24.200
 Sometimes we publish papers on group differences.

1:22:24.200 --> 1:22:27.040
 Those papers sometimes are controversial.

1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:29.600
 These papers are written for a scientific audience.

1:22:29.600 --> 1:22:32.160
 They're not written for the Twitter audience.

1:22:32.160 --> 1:22:35.580
 I don't promote them very much on Twitter.

1:22:37.480 --> 1:22:41.240
 But in a scientific paper,

1:22:41.240 --> 1:22:44.600
 you have to now choose your words carefully also,

1:22:44.600 --> 1:22:49.480
 because those papers are picked up by non scientists,

1:22:49.480 --> 1:22:52.000
 by writers of various kinds,

1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:56.120
 and you have to be available to discuss what you're saying

1:22:56.120 --> 1:22:57.800
 and what you're not saying.

1:22:58.720 --> 1:23:03.720
 Sometimes you are successful at having a good conversation

1:23:04.640 --> 1:23:09.200
 like we are today, that doesn't start out pejorative.

1:23:09.200 --> 1:23:12.520
 Other times I've been asked to participate in debates

1:23:12.520 --> 1:23:16.500
 where my role would be to justify race science.

1:23:16.500 --> 1:23:19.560
 Well, you can see you start out.

1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:25.680
 That was a BBC request that I received.

1:23:25.680 --> 1:23:28.280
 I have so much, it's a love hate relationship,

1:23:28.280 --> 1:23:33.000
 mostly hate with these shallow journalism organizations.

1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:35.160
 So they would want to use you

1:23:36.240 --> 1:23:39.180
 as a kind of in a debate setting to communicate

1:23:39.180 --> 1:23:42.300
 as to like there is raised differences between groups

1:23:42.300 --> 1:23:46.520
 and make that into debate and put you in a role of...

1:23:47.880 --> 1:23:49.280
 Justifying racism.

1:23:49.280 --> 1:23:50.120
 Justifying racism.

1:23:50.120 --> 1:23:51.120
 That's what they're asking me to do.

1:23:51.120 --> 1:23:54.360
 Courses like educating about this field

1:23:54.360 --> 1:23:56.040
 of the science of intelligence, yeah.

1:23:56.040 --> 1:23:57.980
 I wanna say one more thing

1:23:57.980 --> 1:24:01.320
 before we get off the normal distribution.

1:24:01.320 --> 1:24:06.160
 You also asked me what is the science after the bell curve?

1:24:06.160 --> 1:24:09.640
 And the short answer is there's not much new work,

1:24:09.640 --> 1:24:13.420
 but whatever work there is supports the idea

1:24:13.420 --> 1:24:16.280
 that there still are group differences.

1:24:16.280 --> 1:24:18.560
 It's arguable whether those differences

1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:20.700
 have diminished at all or not.

1:24:20.700 --> 1:24:24.940
 And there is still a major problem

1:24:24.940 --> 1:24:28.260
 in underperformance for school achievement

1:24:29.100 --> 1:24:33.400
 for many disadvantaged and minority students.

1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:37.020
 And there so far is no way to fix it.

1:24:37.020 --> 1:24:39.780
 What do we do with this information?

1:24:39.780 --> 1:24:42.060
 Is this now a task?

1:24:42.060 --> 1:24:43.960
 Now we'll talk about the future

1:24:45.620 --> 1:24:47.700
 on the neuroscience and the biology side,

1:24:47.700 --> 1:24:51.100
 but in terms of this information as a society

1:24:51.100 --> 1:24:53.480
 in the public policy, in the political space,

1:24:53.480 --> 1:24:56.260
 in the social space, what do we do with this information?

1:24:56.260 --> 1:24:57.880
 I've thought a lot about this.

1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:02.880
 The first step is to have people interested in policy

1:25:03.220 --> 1:25:06.940
 understand what the data actually show

1:25:06.940 --> 1:25:09.800
 to pay attention to intelligence data.

1:25:09.800 --> 1:25:13.460
 You can read policy papers about education

1:25:13.460 --> 1:25:15.840
 and using your word processor,

1:25:15.840 --> 1:25:17.860
 you can search for the word intelligence.

1:25:17.860 --> 1:25:22.100
 You can search a 20,000 word document in a second

1:25:22.100 --> 1:25:26.780
 and find out the word intelligence does not appear anywhere.

1:25:26.780 --> 1:25:31.780
 In most discussions about what to do about achievement gaps,

1:25:32.500 --> 1:25:33.640
 I'm not talking about test gaps,

1:25:33.640 --> 1:25:37.340
 I'm talking about actual achievement gaps in schools,

1:25:37.340 --> 1:25:40.140
 which everyone agrees is a problem,

1:25:40.140 --> 1:25:43.940
 the word intelligence doesn't appear among educators.

1:25:43.940 --> 1:25:44.780
 That's fascinating.

1:25:44.780 --> 1:25:47.660
 As a matter of fact, in California,

1:25:47.660 --> 1:25:50.020
 there has been tremendous controversy

1:25:50.020 --> 1:25:53.100
 about recent attempts to revise the curriculum

1:25:53.100 --> 1:25:55.500
 for math in high schools.

1:25:56.380 --> 1:25:59.140
 And we had a Stanford professor of education

1:25:59.140 --> 1:26:02.820
 who was running this review assert

1:26:02.820 --> 1:26:06.620
 there's no such thing as talent, mathematical talent.

1:26:07.860 --> 1:26:12.300
 And she wanted to get rid of the advanced classes in math

1:26:12.300 --> 1:26:15.340
 because not everyone could do that.

1:26:15.340 --> 1:26:17.260
 Now, of course, this has been very controversial,

1:26:17.260 --> 1:26:19.260
 they've retreated somewhat,

1:26:19.260 --> 1:26:21.620
 but the idea that a university professor

1:26:21.620 --> 1:26:23.500
 was in charge of this who believes

1:26:26.140 --> 1:26:31.140
 that there's no talent, that it doesn't exist,

1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:33.540
 this is rather shocking,

1:26:33.540 --> 1:26:37.460
 let alone the complete absence of intelligence data.

1:26:37.460 --> 1:26:38.980
 By the way, let me tell you something

1:26:38.980 --> 1:26:41.980
 about what the intelligence data show.

1:26:41.980 --> 1:26:43.580
 Let's take race out of it.

1:26:45.540 --> 1:26:48.260
 Even though the origins of these studies

1:26:48.260 --> 1:26:50.900
 were a long time ago,

1:26:52.020 --> 1:26:53.900
 I'm blocking on the name of the report,

1:26:53.900 --> 1:26:57.700
 the Coleman report was a famous report about education.

1:26:57.700 --> 1:27:01.900
 And they measured all kinds of variables about schools,

1:27:01.900 --> 1:27:03.460
 about teachers,

1:27:03.460 --> 1:27:08.100
 and they looked at academic achievement as an outcome.

1:27:08.100 --> 1:27:12.660
 And they found the most predictive variables

1:27:12.660 --> 1:27:15.980
 of education outcome were the variables

1:27:15.980 --> 1:27:20.340
 the student brought with him or her into the school,

1:27:20.340 --> 1:27:21.940
 essentially their ability.

1:27:23.380 --> 1:27:26.380
 And that when you combine the school

1:27:26.380 --> 1:27:29.460
 and the teacher variables together,

1:27:29.460 --> 1:27:31.860
 the quality of the school, the funding of the school,

1:27:31.860 --> 1:27:34.620
 the quality of the teachers, their education,

1:27:34.620 --> 1:27:37.540
 you put all the teacher and school variables together,

1:27:37.540 --> 1:27:40.220
 it barely accounted for 10% of the variance.

1:27:41.660 --> 1:27:43.500
 And this has been replicated now.

1:27:45.340 --> 1:27:50.340
 So the best research we have shows that school variables

1:27:51.660 --> 1:27:54.740
 and teacher variables together account

1:27:54.740 --> 1:27:58.140
 for about 10% of student academic achievement.

1:27:59.500 --> 1:28:02.060
 Now, you wanna have some policy

1:28:02.060 --> 1:28:04.780
 on improving academic achievement,

1:28:04.780 --> 1:28:08.340
 how much money do you wanna put into teacher education?

1:28:08.340 --> 1:28:11.620
 How much money do you wanna put into the quality

1:28:11.620 --> 1:28:14.220
 of the school administration?

1:28:14.220 --> 1:28:15.340
 You know who you can ask?

1:28:15.340 --> 1:28:17.220
 You can ask the Gates Foundation,

1:28:18.100 --> 1:28:21.500
 because they spent a tremendous amount of money doing that.

1:28:21.500 --> 1:28:25.100
 And at the end of it, because they're measurement people,

1:28:25.100 --> 1:28:27.540
 they wanna know the data,

1:28:27.540 --> 1:28:29.660
 they found it had no impact at all.

1:28:29.660 --> 1:28:33.460
 And they've kind of pulled out of that kind of program.

1:28:33.460 --> 1:28:34.980
 So, oh boy.

1:28:36.220 --> 1:28:41.220
 Let me ask you, this is me talking, but there's...

1:28:41.380 --> 1:28:42.660
 Just the two of us.

1:28:42.660 --> 1:28:44.900
 Just the two of us, but I'm gonna say

1:28:44.900 --> 1:28:46.660
 some funny and ridiculous things,

1:28:46.660 --> 1:28:49.940
 so you're surely not approving of it.

1:28:51.260 --> 1:28:53.940
 But there's a movie called Clerks.

1:28:53.940 --> 1:28:54.780
 You probably...

1:28:54.780 --> 1:28:56.380
 I've seen it, I've seen it, yeah.

1:28:56.380 --> 1:28:59.860
 There's a funny scene in there where a lovely couple

1:28:59.860 --> 1:29:01.460
 are talking about the number

1:29:01.460 --> 1:29:03.940
 of previous sexual partners they had.

1:29:03.940 --> 1:29:07.820
 And the woman says that,

1:29:07.820 --> 1:29:09.580
 I believe she just had a handful,

1:29:09.580 --> 1:29:12.620
 like two or three or something like that sexual partners,

1:29:12.620 --> 1:29:16.900
 but then she also mentioned that she...

1:29:17.860 --> 1:29:19.020
 What's that called?

1:29:19.020 --> 1:29:20.380
 Fallacia, what's the scientific?

1:29:20.380 --> 1:29:23.060
 But she went, you know, gave a blow job

1:29:23.060 --> 1:29:26.180
 to 37 guys, I believe it is.

1:29:26.180 --> 1:29:29.980
 And so that has to do with the truth.

1:29:29.980 --> 1:29:34.460
 So sometimes, knowing the truth

1:29:35.940 --> 1:29:39.540
 can get in the way of a successful relationship

1:29:39.540 --> 1:29:42.100
 of love of some of the human flourishing.

1:29:43.020 --> 1:29:46.380
 And that seems to me that's at the core here,

1:29:46.380 --> 1:29:49.860
 that facing some kind of truth

1:29:49.860 --> 1:29:52.620
 that's not able to be changed

1:29:53.740 --> 1:29:56.260
 makes it difficult to sort of...

1:29:56.260 --> 1:29:59.940
 Is limiting as opposed to empowering.

1:29:59.940 --> 1:30:01.300
 That's the concern.

1:30:01.300 --> 1:30:03.940
 If you sort of test for intelligence

1:30:03.940 --> 1:30:06.180
 and lay the data out,

1:30:06.180 --> 1:30:09.140
 it feels like you will give up on certain people.

1:30:09.140 --> 1:30:12.580
 You will sort of start bidding people,

1:30:12.580 --> 1:30:15.620
 it's like, well, this person is like,

1:30:15.620 --> 1:30:18.060
 let's focus on the average people

1:30:18.060 --> 1:30:20.060
 or let's focus on the very intelligent people.

1:30:20.060 --> 1:30:21.500
 That's the concern.

1:30:21.500 --> 1:30:26.500
 And there's a kind of intuition

1:30:26.700 --> 1:30:28.740
 that if we just don't measure

1:30:29.580 --> 1:30:31.660
 and we don't use that data,

1:30:31.660 --> 1:30:33.620
 that we will treat everybody equal

1:30:33.620 --> 1:30:37.860
 and give everybody equal opportunity.

1:30:37.860 --> 1:30:39.660
 If we have the data in front of us,

1:30:39.660 --> 1:30:43.820
 we're likely to misdistribute

1:30:43.820 --> 1:30:46.340
 the amount of sort of attention we allocate,

1:30:46.340 --> 1:30:49.420
 resources we allocate to people.

1:30:49.420 --> 1:30:52.180
 That's probably the concern.

1:30:52.180 --> 1:30:55.100
 It's a realistic concern,

1:30:55.100 --> 1:30:57.660
 but I think it's a misplaced concern

1:30:57.660 --> 1:31:00.540
 if you wanna fix the problem.

1:31:00.540 --> 1:31:02.060
 If you wanna fix the problem,

1:31:02.060 --> 1:31:03.900
 you have to know what the problem is.

1:31:03.900 --> 1:31:05.140
 Yep.

1:31:05.140 --> 1:31:06.820
 Now, let me tell you this,

1:31:06.820 --> 1:31:08.860
 let's go back to the bell curve,

1:31:08.860 --> 1:31:11.340
 not the bell curve, but the normal distribution.

1:31:11.340 --> 1:31:20.340
 Yes, 16% of the population on average has an IQ under 85,

1:31:20.540 --> 1:31:22.100
 which means they're very hard.

1:31:22.100 --> 1:31:24.220
 If you have an IQ under 85,

1:31:24.220 --> 1:31:26.780
 it's very hard to find gainful employment

1:31:26.780 --> 1:31:31.260
 at a salary that sustains you

1:31:31.260 --> 1:31:35.420
 at least minimally in modern life, okay?

1:31:35.420 --> 1:31:37.540
 Not impossible, but it's very difficult.

1:31:37.540 --> 1:31:41.380
 16% of the population of the United States

1:31:41.380 --> 1:31:47.420
 is about 51 or 52 million people with IQs under 85.

1:31:47.420 --> 1:31:51.620
 This is not a small issue.

1:31:51.620 --> 1:31:55.220
 14 million children have IQs under 85.

1:31:57.100 --> 1:31:59.820
 Is this something we wanna ignore?

1:31:59.820 --> 1:32:03.540
 Does this have any, what is the Venn diagram between,

1:32:03.540 --> 1:32:07.140
 you know, when you have people with IQs under 85,

1:32:07.140 --> 1:32:12.140
 and you have achievement in school or achievement in life?

1:32:13.540 --> 1:32:16.020
 There's a lot of overlap there.

1:32:16.020 --> 1:32:18.940
 This is why, to go back to the IQ pill,

1:32:18.940 --> 1:32:27.380
 if there were a way to shift that curve toward the higher end,

1:32:27.380 --> 1:32:30.980
 that would have a big impact.

1:32:30.980 --> 1:32:34.860
 If I could maybe, before we talk about the impact on life

1:32:34.860 --> 1:32:38.500
 and so on, some of the criticisms of the bell curve.

1:32:38.500 --> 1:32:41.940
 So Steven Jay Gould wrote that the bell curve

1:32:41.940 --> 1:32:44.860
 rests on four incorrect assumptions.

1:32:44.860 --> 1:32:46.900
 It would be just interesting to get your thoughts

1:32:46.900 --> 1:32:48.940
 on the four assumptions, which are,

1:32:48.940 --> 1:32:51.980
 intelligence must be reducible to a single number,

1:32:51.980 --> 1:32:54.740
 intelligence must be capable of rank ordering people

1:32:54.740 --> 1:32:56.100
 in a linear order,

1:32:56.100 --> 1:32:59.860
 intelligence must be primarily genetically based,

1:32:59.860 --> 1:33:03.860
 and intelligence must be essentially immutable.

1:33:03.860 --> 1:33:09.740
 Maybe not as criticisms, but as thoughts about intelligence.

1:33:09.740 --> 1:33:13.620
 Oh yeah, we could spend a lot of time on him.

1:33:13.620 --> 1:33:14.700
 On Steven Jay Gould?

1:33:14.700 --> 1:33:15.700
 Yes.

1:33:15.700 --> 1:33:20.700
 He wrote that in what, about 1985, 1984?

1:33:20.700 --> 1:33:25.980
 His views were overtly political, not scientific.

1:33:25.980 --> 1:33:27.380
 He was a scientist,

1:33:27.380 --> 1:33:30.700
 but his views on this were overtly political,

1:33:30.700 --> 1:33:33.820
 and I would encourage people listening to this,

1:33:33.820 --> 1:33:38.940
 if they really want to understand his criticisms,

1:33:38.940 --> 1:33:44.420
 they should just Google what he had to say,

1:33:44.420 --> 1:33:49.740
 and Google the scientific reviews of his book,

1:33:49.740 --> 1:33:51.500
 The Mismeasure of Man,

1:33:51.500 --> 1:33:54.740
 and they will take these statements apart.

1:33:54.740 --> 1:33:57.940
 They were wrong, not only were they wrong,

1:33:57.940 --> 1:34:00.380
 but when he asserted in his first book

1:34:00.380 --> 1:34:05.620
 that there was no biological basis essentially to IQ,

1:34:05.620 --> 1:34:08.260
 by the time the second edition came around,

1:34:08.260 --> 1:34:13.980
 there were studies of MRIs showing that brain size,

1:34:13.980 --> 1:34:16.860
 brain volume were correlated to IQ scores,

1:34:16.860 --> 1:34:19.940
 which he declined to put in his book.

1:34:19.940 --> 1:34:21.900
 So I'm learning a lot today.

1:34:21.900 --> 1:34:25.820
 I didn't know actually the extent of his work.

1:34:25.820 --> 1:34:28.940
 I was just using a few little snippets of criticism.

1:34:28.940 --> 1:34:29.940
 That's interesting.

1:34:29.940 --> 1:34:30.940
 There was a battle here.

1:34:30.940 --> 1:34:32.820
 He wrote a book, Mismeasure of Man,

1:34:32.820 --> 1:34:36.220
 that's missing a lot of the scientific grounding.

1:34:36.220 --> 1:34:39.700
 His book is highly popular in colleges today.

1:34:39.700 --> 1:34:41.660
 You can find it in any college bookstore

1:34:41.660 --> 1:34:42.980
 under assigned reading.

1:34:42.980 --> 1:34:44.220
 It's highly popular.

1:34:44.220 --> 1:34:45.220
 The Mismeasure of Man?

1:34:45.220 --> 1:34:46.220
 Yes, highly influential.

1:34:46.220 --> 1:34:48.580
 Can you speak to the Mismeasure of Man?

1:34:48.580 --> 1:34:50.140
 I'm undereducated about this.

1:34:50.140 --> 1:34:54.580
 So is this the book basically criticizing the ideas in the book?

1:34:54.580 --> 1:34:57.580
 Yeah, where those four things came from.

1:34:57.580 --> 1:35:04.580
 And it is really a book that was really taken apart point by point

1:35:04.580 --> 1:35:08.100
 by a number of people who actually understood the data.

1:35:08.100 --> 1:35:09.100
 And he didn't care.

1:35:09.100 --> 1:35:10.100
 Yeah.

1:35:10.100 --> 1:35:11.100
 He didn't care.

1:35:11.100 --> 1:35:12.100
 He didn't modify anything.

1:35:12.100 --> 1:35:16.700
 Listen, because this is such a sensitive topic,

1:35:16.700 --> 1:35:24.800
 like I said, I believe the impact of the work,

1:35:24.800 --> 1:35:28.620
 because it is misinterpreted, has to be considered.

1:35:28.620 --> 1:35:31.380
 Because it's not just going to be scientific discourse,

1:35:31.380 --> 1:35:32.940
 it's going to be political discourse,

1:35:32.940 --> 1:35:34.700
 there's going to be debates,

1:35:34.700 --> 1:35:39.380
 there's going to be politically motivated people

1:35:39.380 --> 1:35:42.780
 that will use messages in each direction,

1:35:42.780 --> 1:35:45.060
 make something like the bulk of the enemy

1:35:45.060 --> 1:35:52.180
 or the support for one's racist beliefs.

1:35:52.180 --> 1:35:55.260
 And so I think you have to consider that.

1:35:55.260 --> 1:35:59.300
 But it's difficult because Nietzsche was used by Hitler

1:35:59.300 --> 1:36:02.380
 to justify a lot of his beliefs.

1:36:02.380 --> 1:36:09.060
 And it's not exactly on Nietzsche to anticipate Hitler

1:36:09.060 --> 1:36:12.820
 or how his ideas will be misinterpreted and used for evil.

1:36:12.820 --> 1:36:14.680
 But there is a balance there.

1:36:14.680 --> 1:36:15.680
 So I understand.

1:36:15.680 --> 1:36:16.680
 This is really interesting.

1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:17.680
 I didn't know.

1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:20.740
 Is there any criticism of the book you find compelling

1:36:20.740 --> 1:36:23.740
 or interesting or challenging to you from a scientific perspective?

1:36:23.740 --> 1:36:29.900
 There were factual criticisms about the nature of the statistics

1:36:29.900 --> 1:36:32.620
 that were used, the statistical analyses.

1:36:32.620 --> 1:36:34.940
 These are more technical criticisms.

1:36:34.940 --> 1:36:38.020
 And they were addressed by Murray in a couple of articles

1:36:38.020 --> 1:36:41.940
 where he took all the criticisms and spoke to them.

1:36:41.940 --> 1:36:44.940
 And people listening to this podcast

1:36:44.940 --> 1:36:47.940
 can certainly find all those online.

1:36:47.940 --> 1:36:48.980
 And it's very interesting.

1:36:48.980 --> 1:36:52.740
 Murray went on to write some additional books,

1:36:52.740 --> 1:36:57.860
 two in the last couple of years, one about human diversity

1:36:57.860 --> 1:37:02.980
 where he goes through the data refuting the idea that race

1:37:02.980 --> 1:37:07.980
 is only a social construct with no biological meaning.

1:37:07.980 --> 1:37:09.820
 He discusses the data.

1:37:09.820 --> 1:37:11.020
 It's a very good discussion.

1:37:11.020 --> 1:37:12.500
 You don't have to agree with it.

1:37:12.500 --> 1:37:16.420
 But he presents data in a cogent way.

1:37:16.420 --> 1:37:19.060
 And he talks about the critics of that.

1:37:19.060 --> 1:37:23.460
 And he talks about their data in a cogent, nonpersonal way.

1:37:23.460 --> 1:37:26.860
 It's a very informative discussion.

1:37:26.860 --> 1:37:28.940
 The book is called Human Diversity.

1:37:28.940 --> 1:37:29.900
 He talks about race.

1:37:29.900 --> 1:37:34.620
 And he talks about gender, same thing, about sex differences.

1:37:34.620 --> 1:37:37.180
 And more recently, he's written what

1:37:37.180 --> 1:37:43.060
 might be his final say on this, a book called Facing Reality

1:37:43.060 --> 1:37:46.220
 where he talks about this again.

1:37:46.220 --> 1:37:49.580
 So he can certainly defend himself.

1:37:49.580 --> 1:37:52.100
 He doesn't need me to do that.

1:37:52.100 --> 1:37:55.060
 But I would urge people who have heard

1:37:55.060 --> 1:37:58.500
 about him and the bell curve and who

1:37:58.500 --> 1:38:03.500
 think they know what's in it, you are likely incorrect.

1:38:03.500 --> 1:38:06.300
 And you need to read it for yourself.

1:38:06.300 --> 1:38:12.220
 But it is, scientifically, it's a serious subject.

1:38:12.220 --> 1:38:13.580
 It's a difficult subject.

1:38:13.580 --> 1:38:15.980
 Ethically, it's a difficult subject.

1:38:15.980 --> 1:38:19.740
 Everything you said here, calmly and thoughtfully,

1:38:19.740 --> 1:38:21.620
 is difficult. It's difficult for me

1:38:21.620 --> 1:38:26.420
 to even consider that G factor exists.

1:38:26.420 --> 1:38:29.860
 I don't mean from like that somehow G factor is inherently

1:38:29.860 --> 1:38:32.260
 racist or sexist or whatever.

1:38:32.260 --> 1:38:35.260
 It's just it's difficult in the way

1:38:35.260 --> 1:38:38.220
 that considering the fact that we die one day is difficult.

1:38:38.220 --> 1:38:42.820
 That we are limited by our biology is difficult.

1:38:42.820 --> 1:38:47.740
 And at least from an American perspective,

1:38:47.740 --> 1:38:49.300
 you would like to believe that everything

1:38:49.300 --> 1:38:51.380
 is possible in this world.

1:38:51.380 --> 1:38:56.220
 Well, that leads us to what I think

1:38:56.220 --> 1:38:59.980
 we should do with this information.

1:38:59.980 --> 1:39:03.300
 And what I think we should do with this information

1:39:03.300 --> 1:39:07.660
 is unusual.

1:39:07.660 --> 1:39:09.540
 Because I think what we need to do

1:39:09.540 --> 1:39:13.420
 is fund more neuroscience research on the molecular

1:39:13.420 --> 1:39:16.780
 biology of learning and memory.

1:39:16.780 --> 1:39:22.060
 Because one definition of intelligence

1:39:22.060 --> 1:39:24.580
 is based on how much you can learn

1:39:24.580 --> 1:39:27.140
 and how much you can remember.

1:39:27.140 --> 1:39:30.860
 And if you accept that definition of intelligence,

1:39:30.860 --> 1:39:35.580
 then there are molecular studies going on now,

1:39:35.580 --> 1:39:40.820
 and Nobel Prizes being won on molecular biology

1:39:40.820 --> 1:39:45.420
 or molecular neurobiology of learning and memory.

1:39:45.420 --> 1:39:49.500
 Now, the step those researchers, those scientists

1:39:49.500 --> 1:39:53.180
 need to take when it comes to intelligence

1:39:53.180 --> 1:39:58.260
 is to focus on the concept of individual differences.

1:39:58.260 --> 1:40:03.740
 Intelligence research has individual differences

1:40:03.740 --> 1:40:08.900
 as its heart because it assumes that people

1:40:08.900 --> 1:40:10.700
 differ on this variable.

1:40:10.700 --> 1:40:13.020
 And those differences are meaningful

1:40:13.020 --> 1:40:15.900
 and need understanding.

1:40:15.900 --> 1:40:19.340
 Cognitive psychologists who have morphed

1:40:19.340 --> 1:40:23.420
 into molecular biologists studying learning and memory

1:40:23.420 --> 1:40:27.460
 hate the concept of individual differences historically.

1:40:27.460 --> 1:40:30.180
 Some now are coming around to it.

1:40:30.180 --> 1:40:34.740
 I once sat next to a Nobel Prize winner

1:40:34.740 --> 1:40:37.860
 for his work on memory.

1:40:37.860 --> 1:40:41.340
 And I asked him about individual differences.

1:40:41.340 --> 1:40:42.820
 And he said, don't go there.

1:40:42.820 --> 1:40:46.580
 It'll set us back 50 years.

1:40:46.580 --> 1:40:48.660
 But I said, don't you think they're

1:40:48.660 --> 1:40:50.420
 the key, though, to understand?

1:40:50.420 --> 1:40:53.980
 Why can some people remember more than others?

1:40:53.980 --> 1:40:55.980
 He said, you don't want to go there.

1:40:55.980 --> 1:40:58.700
 I think the 21st century will be remembered

1:40:58.700 --> 1:41:02.140
 by the technology and the science that

1:41:02.140 --> 1:41:04.100
 goes to individual differences.

1:41:04.100 --> 1:41:05.540
 Because we have now data.

1:41:05.540 --> 1:41:07.380
 We have now the tools to much, much better

1:41:07.380 --> 1:41:10.100
 to start to measure, start to estimate,

1:41:10.100 --> 1:41:13.940
 not just on the sort of through tests and IQ test type

1:41:13.940 --> 1:41:18.220
 of things, sort of outside the body kind of things,

1:41:18.220 --> 1:41:20.380
 but measuring all kinds of stuff about the body.

1:41:20.380 --> 1:41:23.140
 So yeah, truly go into the molecular biology,

1:41:23.140 --> 1:41:27.260
 to the neurobiology, to the neuroscience.

1:41:27.260 --> 1:41:31.940
 Let me ask you about life.

1:41:31.940 --> 1:41:36.820
 How does intelligence correlate with or lead to

1:41:36.820 --> 1:41:39.060
 or has anything to do with career success?

1:41:39.060 --> 1:41:40.660
 You've mentioned these kinds of things.

1:41:40.660 --> 1:41:43.380
 And is there any data?

1:41:43.380 --> 1:41:44.780
 You had an excellent conversation

1:41:44.780 --> 1:41:46.740
 with Jordan Peterson, for example.

1:41:46.740 --> 1:41:49.820
 Is there any data on what intelligent

1:41:49.820 --> 1:41:53.380
 means for success in life?

1:41:53.380 --> 1:41:54.540
 Success in life.

1:41:54.540 --> 1:42:00.620
 There is a tremendous amount of validity data

1:42:00.620 --> 1:42:08.260
 that looked at intelligence test scores and various measures

1:42:08.260 --> 1:42:11.380
 of life success.

1:42:11.380 --> 1:42:17.420
 Now, of course, life success is a pretty broad topic.

1:42:17.420 --> 1:42:22.100
 And not everybody agrees on what success means.

1:42:22.100 --> 1:42:28.460
 But there's general agreement on certain aspects of success

1:42:28.460 --> 1:42:29.540
 that can be measured.

1:42:33.180 --> 1:42:35.060
 Including life expectancy, like you said.

1:42:35.060 --> 1:42:36.500
 Life expectancy.

1:42:36.500 --> 1:42:37.660
 Now, there's life success.

1:42:42.020 --> 1:42:47.460
 Life expectancy, I mean, that is such an interesting finding.

1:42:47.460 --> 1:42:54.020
 But IQ scores are also correlated to things like income.

1:42:54.020 --> 1:42:59.900
 Now, OK, so who thinks income means you're successful?

1:42:59.900 --> 1:43:01.340
 That's not the point.

1:43:01.340 --> 1:43:06.540
 The point is that income is one empirical measure

1:43:06.540 --> 1:43:09.300
 in this culture that says something

1:43:09.300 --> 1:43:11.500
 about your level of success.

1:43:11.500 --> 1:43:13.620
 You can define success in ways that

1:43:13.620 --> 1:43:15.980
 have nothing to do with income.

1:43:15.980 --> 1:43:21.100
 You can define success based on your evolutionary natural

1:43:21.100 --> 1:43:22.820
 selection success.

1:43:25.220 --> 1:43:29.780
 But for variables, and even that, by the way,

1:43:29.780 --> 1:43:33.940
 is correlated to IQ in some studies.

1:43:33.940 --> 1:43:42.300
 So however you want to define success, IQ is important.

1:43:42.300 --> 1:43:44.260
 It's not the only determinant.

1:43:44.260 --> 1:43:46.780
 People get hung up on, well, what about personality?

1:43:46.780 --> 1:43:49.300
 What about so called emotional intelligence?

1:43:49.300 --> 1:43:51.980
 Yes, all those things matter.

1:43:51.980 --> 1:43:54.460
 The thing that matters empirically,

1:43:54.460 --> 1:43:56.380
 the single thing that matters the most

1:43:56.380 --> 1:44:01.180
 is your general ability, your general mental intellectual

1:44:01.180 --> 1:44:03.580
 ability, your reasoning ability.

1:44:03.580 --> 1:44:07.100
 And the more complex your vocation,

1:44:07.100 --> 1:44:11.500
 the more complex your job, the more G matters.

1:44:11.500 --> 1:44:14.580
 G doesn't matter in a lot of occupations

1:44:14.580 --> 1:44:17.020
 don't require complex thinking.

1:44:17.020 --> 1:44:20.940
 And there are occupations like that, and G doesn't matter.

1:44:20.940 --> 1:44:28.300
 Within an occupation, the G might not matter so much.

1:44:28.300 --> 1:44:36.260
 So that if you look at all the professors at MIT

1:44:36.260 --> 1:44:40.220
 and had a way to rank order them,

1:44:40.220 --> 1:44:43.060
 there's a ceiling effect is what I'm saying.

1:44:43.060 --> 1:44:45.140
 That, you know.

1:44:45.140 --> 1:44:47.140
 Also, when you get past a certain threshold,

1:44:47.140 --> 1:44:49.900
 then there's impact on wealth, for example,

1:44:49.900 --> 1:44:52.460
 or career success, however that's

1:44:52.460 --> 1:44:54.220
 defined in each individual discipline.

1:44:54.220 --> 1:44:56.780
 But after a certain point, it doesn't matter.

1:44:56.780 --> 1:44:59.380
 Actually, it does matter in certain things.

1:44:59.380 --> 1:45:04.500
 So for example, there is a very classic study

1:45:04.500 --> 1:45:07.220
 that was started at Johns Hopkins when

1:45:07.220 --> 1:45:08.780
 I was a graduate student there.

1:45:08.780 --> 1:45:11.260
 And I actually worked on this study at the very beginning.

1:45:11.260 --> 1:45:13.700
 It's the study of mathematically and scientifically

1:45:13.700 --> 1:45:15.660
 precocious youth.

1:45:15.660 --> 1:45:20.140
 And they gave junior high school students

1:45:20.140 --> 1:45:27.140
 age 11 and 12 the standard SAT math exam.

1:45:27.140 --> 1:45:31.420
 And they found a very large number of students

1:45:31.420 --> 1:45:33.900
 scored very high on this exam.

1:45:33.900 --> 1:45:35.100
 Not a large number.

1:45:35.100 --> 1:45:37.700
 I mean, they found many students when

1:45:37.700 --> 1:45:40.700
 they cast the net to all of Baltimore.

1:45:40.700 --> 1:45:42.900
 They found a number of students who

1:45:42.900 --> 1:45:45.460
 scored as high on the SAT math when

1:45:45.460 --> 1:45:50.220
 they were 12 years old as incoming Hopkins freshmen.

1:45:50.220 --> 1:45:53.580
 And they said, gee, now this is interesting.

1:45:53.580 --> 1:45:56.860
 What shall we do now?

1:45:56.860 --> 1:46:00.140
 And on a case by case basis, they

1:46:00.140 --> 1:46:03.860
 got some of those kids into their local community college

1:46:03.860 --> 1:46:06.660
 math programs.

1:46:06.660 --> 1:46:10.260
 Many of those kids went on to be very successful.

1:46:10.260 --> 1:46:14.940
 And now there's a 50 year follow up of those kids.

1:46:14.940 --> 1:46:21.380
 And it turns out these kids were in the top 1%.

1:46:21.380 --> 1:46:24.820
 So everybody in this study is in the top 1%.

1:46:24.820 --> 1:46:28.100
 If you take that group, that rarefied group,

1:46:28.100 --> 1:46:33.100
 and divide them into quartiles so that you have the top 25%

1:46:33.100 --> 1:46:39.780
 of the top 1% and the bottom 25% of the top 1%,

1:46:39.780 --> 1:46:48.020
 you can find unmeasurable variables of success.

1:46:48.020 --> 1:46:51.740
 The top quartile does better than the bottom quartile

1:46:51.740 --> 1:46:53.780
 in the top 1%.

1:46:53.780 --> 1:46:54.920
 They have more patents.

1:46:54.920 --> 1:46:56.360
 They have more publications.

1:46:56.360 --> 1:46:59.520
 They have more tenure at universities.

1:46:59.520 --> 1:47:03.140
 And this is based on, you're dividing them

1:47:03.140 --> 1:47:05.980
 based on their score at age 12.

1:47:05.980 --> 1:47:10.220
 I wonder how much interesting data

1:47:10.220 --> 1:47:12.700
 is in the variability in the differences.

1:47:12.700 --> 1:47:16.460
 So but that's really, oh, boy.

1:47:16.460 --> 1:47:17.620
 That's very interesting.

1:47:17.620 --> 1:47:21.020
 But it's also, I don't know, somehow painful.

1:47:21.020 --> 1:47:25.020
 I don't know why it's so painful that that G

1:47:25.020 --> 1:47:31.140
 factor is so determinant of even in the nuanced top percent.

1:47:31.140 --> 1:47:32.780
 This is interesting that you find that painful.

1:47:32.780 --> 1:47:37.180
 Do you find it painful that people with charisma

1:47:37.180 --> 1:47:40.740
 are very successful, can be very successful in life,

1:47:40.740 --> 1:47:43.900
 even though having no other attributes other than they're

1:47:43.900 --> 1:47:45.780
 famous and people like them?

1:47:45.780 --> 1:47:47.380
 Do you find that painful?

1:47:47.380 --> 1:47:51.100
 Yes, if that charisma is untrainable.

1:47:51.100 --> 1:47:53.500
 So one of the things, again, this

1:47:53.500 --> 1:47:56.740
 is like I learned psychology from the Johnny Depp trial.

1:47:56.740 --> 1:48:01.700
 But one of the things the psychologist, the personality

1:48:01.700 --> 1:48:03.380
 psychologist, he can maybe speak to this

1:48:03.380 --> 1:48:07.220
 because he had an interest in this for a time,

1:48:07.220 --> 1:48:12.580
 is she was saying that personality, technically

1:48:12.580 --> 1:48:16.980
 speaking, is the thing that doesn't change over a lifetime.

1:48:16.980 --> 1:48:20.140
 It's the thing you're, I don't know if she was actually

1:48:20.140 --> 1:48:21.660
 implying that you're born with it.

1:48:21.660 --> 1:48:22.780
 Well, it's a trait.

1:48:22.780 --> 1:48:24.580
 It's a trait that's state.

1:48:24.580 --> 1:48:27.220
 It's a trait that's relatively stable over time.

1:48:27.220 --> 1:48:28.940
 I think that's generally correct.

1:48:28.940 --> 1:48:31.060
 So to the degree your personality

1:48:31.060 --> 1:48:36.820
 is stable over time, yes, that too is painful.

1:48:36.820 --> 1:48:40.700
 Because what's not painful is the thing,

1:48:40.700 --> 1:48:42.660
 if I'm fat and out of shape, I can

1:48:42.660 --> 1:48:47.900
 exercise and become healthier in that way.

1:48:47.900 --> 1:48:51.020
 If my diet is a giant mess and that's

1:48:51.020 --> 1:48:53.860
 resulting in some kind of conditions

1:48:53.860 --> 1:48:55.980
 that my body is experiencing, I can fix that

1:48:55.980 --> 1:48:58.100
 by having a better diet.

1:48:58.100 --> 1:49:02.100
 That sort of my actions, my willed actions

1:49:02.100 --> 1:49:03.860
 can make a change.

1:49:03.860 --> 1:49:07.940
 If charisma is part of the personality that's,

1:49:07.940 --> 1:49:10.900
 the part of the charisma that is part of the personality that

1:49:10.900 --> 1:49:15.380
 is stable, yeah, yeah, that's painful too.

1:49:15.380 --> 1:49:18.420
 Because it's like, oh shit, I'm stuck with this.

1:49:18.420 --> 1:49:19.860
 I'm stuck with this.

1:49:19.860 --> 1:49:22.860
 Well, and this pretty much generalizes

1:49:22.860 --> 1:49:24.980
 to every aspect of your being.

1:49:24.980 --> 1:49:26.460
 This is who you are.

1:49:26.460 --> 1:49:27.540
 You've got to deal with it.

1:49:27.540 --> 1:49:29.340
 And what it undermines, of course,

1:49:29.340 --> 1:49:32.580
 is a realistic appreciation for this,

1:49:32.580 --> 1:49:40.740
 undermines the fairly recent idea prevalent in this country

1:49:40.740 --> 1:49:44.020
 that if you work hard, you can be anything you want to be,

1:49:44.020 --> 1:49:47.420
 which has morphed from the original idea

1:49:47.420 --> 1:49:50.860
 that if you work hard, you can be successful.

1:49:50.860 --> 1:49:53.900
 Those are two different things.

1:49:53.900 --> 1:49:57.860
 And now we have if you work hard,

1:49:57.860 --> 1:50:00.860
 you can be anything you want to be.

1:50:00.860 --> 1:50:03.460
 This is completely unrealistic.

1:50:03.460 --> 1:50:04.500
 Sorry.

1:50:04.500 --> 1:50:05.180
 It just is.

1:50:05.180 --> 1:50:06.900
 Now, you can work hard and be successful.

1:50:06.900 --> 1:50:08.500
 There's no question.

1:50:08.500 --> 1:50:09.980
 But you know what?

1:50:09.980 --> 1:50:12.420
 I could work very hard, and I am not

1:50:12.420 --> 1:50:16.820
 going to be a successful theoretical physicist.

1:50:16.820 --> 1:50:18.740
 I'm just not.

1:50:18.740 --> 1:50:21.020
 That said, I mean, we should, because we

1:50:21.020 --> 1:50:26.340
 had this conversation already, but it's good to repeat.

1:50:26.340 --> 1:50:27.700
 The fact that you're not going to be

1:50:27.700 --> 1:50:31.100
 a theoretical physicist is not judgment

1:50:31.100 --> 1:50:32.820
 on your basic humanity.

1:50:32.820 --> 1:50:36.180
 We're turning again to the all men, which means

1:50:36.180 --> 1:50:39.100
 men and women are created equal.

1:50:39.100 --> 1:50:40.620
 So again, some of the differences

1:50:40.620 --> 1:50:47.020
 we're talking about in quote unquote success, wealth,

1:50:47.020 --> 1:50:50.620
 number of whether you win a Nobel Prize or not,

1:50:50.620 --> 1:50:55.820
 that doesn't put a measure on your basic humanity

1:50:55.820 --> 1:51:00.940
 and basic value and even goodness of you

1:51:00.940 --> 1:51:02.500
 as a human being.

1:51:02.500 --> 1:51:06.900
 Because your basic role and value in society

1:51:06.900 --> 1:51:11.940
 is largely within your control.

1:51:11.940 --> 1:51:16.740
 It's some of these measures that we're talking about.

1:51:16.740 --> 1:51:19.380
 It's good to remember this.

1:51:19.380 --> 1:51:22.260
 One question about the Flynn effect.

1:51:22.260 --> 1:51:23.260
 What is it?

1:51:23.260 --> 1:51:27.140
 Are humans getting smarter over the years, over the decades,

1:51:27.140 --> 1:51:28.820
 over the centuries?

1:51:28.820 --> 1:51:33.500
 The Flynn effect is James Flynn, who passed away about a year

1:51:33.500 --> 1:51:42.420
 ago, published a set of analyses going back

1:51:42.420 --> 1:51:46.020
 a couple of decades when he first noticed this,

1:51:46.020 --> 1:51:51.460
 that IQ scores, when you looked over the years,

1:51:51.460 --> 1:51:54.420
 seemed to be drifting up.

1:51:54.420 --> 1:51:58.820
 Now, this was not unknown to the people who make the test

1:51:58.820 --> 1:52:02.220
 because they renorm the test periodically

1:52:02.220 --> 1:52:05.260
 and they have to renorm the test periodically

1:52:05.260 --> 1:52:09.700
 because what 10 items correct meant

1:52:09.700 --> 1:52:13.700
 relative to other people 50 years ago

1:52:13.700 --> 1:52:18.580
 is not the same as what 10 items mean relative today.

1:52:18.580 --> 1:52:21.220
 People are getting more things correct.

1:52:21.220 --> 1:52:24.980
 Now, the scores have been drifting up about three points.

1:52:24.980 --> 1:52:30.180
 IQ scores have been drifting up about three points per decade.

1:52:30.180 --> 1:52:31.700
 This is not a personal effect.

1:52:31.700 --> 1:52:34.020
 This is a cohort effect.

1:52:34.020 --> 1:52:37.100
 Well, it's not for an individual, but.

1:52:37.100 --> 1:52:38.700
 The world, how do you explain?

1:52:38.700 --> 1:52:39.500
 So what's that?

1:52:39.500 --> 1:52:42.420
 And this has presented intelligence researchers

1:52:42.420 --> 1:52:44.580
 with a great mystery.

1:52:44.580 --> 1:52:46.220
 Two questions.

1:52:46.220 --> 1:52:51.140
 First, is it effect on the 50% of the variance that's

1:52:51.140 --> 1:52:55.060
 the G factor or on the other 50%?

1:52:55.060 --> 1:52:59.620
 And there's evidence that it is a G factor effect.

1:52:59.620 --> 1:53:02.660
 And second, what on earth causes this?

1:53:02.660 --> 1:53:05.780
 And doesn't this mean intelligence and G factor

1:53:05.780 --> 1:53:10.220
 cannot be genetic because the scale of natural selection

1:53:10.220 --> 1:53:15.660
 is much, much longer than a couple of decades ago?

1:53:15.660 --> 1:53:19.700
 And so it's been used to try to undermine the idea

1:53:19.700 --> 1:53:24.420
 that there can be a genetic influence on intelligence.

1:53:24.420 --> 1:53:28.540
 But certainly, it can be the Flynn effect

1:53:28.540 --> 1:53:32.060
 can affect the nongenetic aspects of intelligence

1:53:32.060 --> 1:53:37.700
 because genes account for maybe 50% of the variance.

1:53:37.700 --> 1:53:40.900
 Maybe higher, could be as high as 80% for adults,

1:53:40.900 --> 1:53:46.420
 but let's just say 50% for discussion.

1:53:46.420 --> 1:53:50.260
 So the Flynn effect, it's still a mystery.

1:53:50.260 --> 1:53:51.180
 It's still a mystery.

1:53:51.180 --> 1:53:51.780
 That's interesting.

1:53:51.780 --> 1:53:54.060
 It's still a mystery, although the evidence is coming out.

1:53:54.060 --> 1:53:56.700
 I told you before I edited a journal on intelligence,

1:53:56.700 --> 1:54:00.460
 and we're doing a special issue in honor of James Flynn.

1:54:00.460 --> 1:54:03.060
 So I'm starting to see papers now on really

1:54:03.060 --> 1:54:06.300
 the latest research on this.

1:54:06.300 --> 1:54:08.820
 I think most people who specialize

1:54:08.820 --> 1:54:12.460
 in this area of trying to understand the Flynn effect

1:54:12.460 --> 1:54:16.460
 are coming to the view based on data

1:54:16.460 --> 1:54:20.180
 that it has to do with advances in nutrition and health care.

1:54:20.180 --> 1:54:25.100
 And there's also evidence that the effect is slowing down

1:54:25.100 --> 1:54:27.500
 and possibly reversing.

1:54:27.500 --> 1:54:28.340
 Oh, boy.

1:54:28.340 --> 1:54:30.580
 So how would nutrition and health,

1:54:30.580 --> 1:54:36.300
 so nutrition would still be connected to the G factor.

1:54:36.300 --> 1:54:38.660
 So nutrition as it relates to the G factor,

1:54:38.660 --> 1:54:42.060
 so the biology that leads to the intelligence.

1:54:42.060 --> 1:54:42.580
 Yes.

1:54:42.580 --> 1:54:43.820
 That would be the claim.

1:54:43.820 --> 1:54:50.300
 Like the hypothesis being tested by the research.

1:54:50.300 --> 1:54:50.820
 Yes.

1:54:50.820 --> 1:54:54.460
 And there's some evidence from infants

1:54:54.460 --> 1:54:58.540
 that nutrition has made a difference.

1:54:58.540 --> 1:55:02.140
 So it's not an unreasonable connection.

1:55:02.140 --> 1:55:05.740
 But does it negate the idea that there's a genetic influence?

1:55:05.740 --> 1:55:07.980
 Not logically at all.

1:55:07.980 --> 1:55:09.860
 But it is very interesting.

1:55:09.860 --> 1:55:17.460
 So that if you take an IQ test today but you take the score

1:55:17.460 --> 1:55:22.900
 and use the tables that were available in 1940,

1:55:22.900 --> 1:55:27.020
 you're going to wind up with a much higher IQ number.

1:55:27.020 --> 1:55:32.700
 So are we really smarter than a couple of generations ago?

1:55:32.700 --> 1:55:38.300
 No, but we might be able to solve problems a little better.

1:55:38.300 --> 1:55:43.140
 And make use of our G because of things like Sesame Street

1:55:43.140 --> 1:55:45.380
 and other curricula in school.

1:55:45.380 --> 1:55:49.540
 More people are going to school.

1:55:49.540 --> 1:55:53.820
 So there are a lot of factors here to disentangle.

1:55:53.820 --> 1:55:55.060
 It's fascinating though.

1:55:55.060 --> 1:55:58.860
 It's fascinating that there's not clear answers yet.

1:55:58.860 --> 1:56:02.620
 That as a population, we're getting smarter.

1:56:02.620 --> 1:56:04.500
 When you just zoom out, that's what it looks like.

1:56:04.500 --> 1:56:06.020
 As a population, we're getting smarter.

1:56:06.020 --> 1:56:08.740
 And it's interesting to see what the effects of that are.

1:56:08.740 --> 1:56:10.060
 I mean, this raises the question.

1:56:10.060 --> 1:56:14.420
 We've mentioned it many times but haven't clearly addressed it,

1:56:14.420 --> 1:56:17.260
 which is nature versus nurture question.

1:56:17.260 --> 1:56:20.060
 So how much of intelligence is nature?

1:56:20.060 --> 1:56:21.860
 How much of it is nurture?

1:56:21.860 --> 1:56:25.700
 How much of it is determined by genetics versus environment?

1:56:25.700 --> 1:56:26.700
 All of it.

1:56:26.700 --> 1:56:28.100
 All of it is genetics.

1:56:28.100 --> 1:56:32.620
 No, all of it is nature and nurture.

1:56:32.620 --> 1:56:33.620
 So yes.

1:56:33.620 --> 1:56:34.620
 Yes.

1:56:34.620 --> 1:56:36.620
 Okay.

1:56:36.620 --> 1:56:44.940
 But how much of the variance can you apportion to either?

1:56:44.940 --> 1:56:51.580
 Most of the people who work in this field say that the framing of that, if the question

1:56:51.580 --> 1:56:57.500
 is framed that way, it can't be answered because nature and nurture are not two independent

1:56:57.500 --> 1:56:59.460
 influences.

1:56:59.460 --> 1:57:01.420
 They interact with each other.

1:57:01.420 --> 1:57:10.220
 And understanding those interactions is so complex that many behavioral geneticists say

1:57:10.220 --> 1:57:17.380
 it is today impossible and always will be impossible to disentangle that, no matter

1:57:17.380 --> 1:57:24.700
 what kind of advances there are in DNA technology and genomic informatics.

1:57:24.700 --> 1:57:31.580
 But there's still, to push back on that, that same intuition from behavioral geneticists

1:57:31.580 --> 1:57:37.340
 would lead me to believe that there cannot possibly be a stable G factor because it's

1:57:37.340 --> 1:57:39.300
 super complex.

1:57:39.300 --> 1:57:45.300
 Many of them would assert that as a logical outcome.

1:57:45.300 --> 1:57:51.820
 But because I believe there is a stable G factor from lots of sources of data, not just

1:57:51.820 --> 1:58:01.380
 one study, but lots of sources of data over decades, I am more amenable to the idea that

1:58:01.380 --> 1:58:09.940
 whatever interactions between genes and environment exist, they can be explicated, they can be

1:58:09.940 --> 1:58:19.300
 studied, and that information can be used as a basis for molecular biology of intelligence.

1:58:19.300 --> 1:58:27.300
 Yeah, and we'll do this exact question because doesn't the stability of the G factor give

1:58:27.300 --> 1:58:33.780
 you at least a hint that there is a biological basis for intelligence?

1:58:33.780 --> 1:58:42.820
 Yes, I think it's clear that the fact that an IQ score is correlated to things like thickness

1:58:42.820 --> 1:58:55.340
 of your cortex, that it's correlated to glucose metabolic rate in your brain, that identical

1:58:55.340 --> 1:59:02.060
 twins reared apart are highly similar in their IQ scores.

1:59:02.060 --> 1:59:12.140
 These are all important observations that indicate, not just suggest, but indicate that

1:59:12.140 --> 1:59:13.540
 there's a biological basis.

1:59:13.540 --> 1:59:18.620
 And does anyone believe intelligence has nothing to do with the brain?

1:59:18.620 --> 1:59:21.220
 I mean, it's so obvious.

1:59:21.220 --> 1:59:26.620
 Well indirectly definitely has to do with it, but the question is environment interacting

1:59:26.620 --> 1:59:34.920
 with the brain or is it the actual raw hardware of the brain?

1:59:34.920 --> 1:59:45.500
 Well some would say that the raw hardware of the brain as it develops from conception

1:59:45.500 --> 1:59:52.700
 through adulthood, or at least through the childhood, that that so called hardware that

1:59:52.700 --> 2:00:01.220
 you are assuming is mostly genetic, in fact, is not as deterministic as you might think,

2:00:01.220 --> 2:00:09.740
 but it is probabilistic and what affects the probabilities are things like in uterine environment

2:00:09.740 --> 2:00:15.140
 and other factors like that, including chance.

2:00:15.140 --> 2:00:22.680
 That chance affects the way the neurons are connecting during gestation.

2:00:22.680 --> 2:00:26.820
 It's not, hey, it's pre programmed.

2:00:26.820 --> 2:00:35.500
 So there is push back on the concept that genes provide a blueprint, that it's a lot

2:00:35.500 --> 2:00:36.500
 more fluid.

2:00:36.500 --> 2:00:44.020
 Well, but also, yeah, so there's a lot, a lot, a lot happens in the first few months

2:00:44.020 --> 2:00:47.340
 of development.

2:00:47.340 --> 2:00:57.180
 So in nine months inside the mother's body and in the few months afterwards, there's

2:00:57.180 --> 2:01:02.120
 a lot of fascinating stuff, like including chance and luck, like you said, how things

2:01:02.120 --> 2:01:04.220
 connect up.

2:01:04.220 --> 2:01:08.460
 The question is afterwards in your plasticity of the brain, how much adjustment there is

2:01:08.460 --> 2:01:14.140
 relative to the environment, how much that affects the G factor, but that's where the

2:01:14.140 --> 2:01:19.140
 whole conclusions of the studies that we've been talking about is that seems to have less

2:01:19.140 --> 2:01:23.620
 and less and less of an effect as pretty quickly.

2:01:23.620 --> 2:01:30.060
 As yes, and I do think there is more of a genetic, by my view, and I'm not an expert

2:01:30.060 --> 2:01:34.180
 on this, I mean, genetics is a highly technical and complex subject.

2:01:34.180 --> 2:01:41.900
 I am not a geneticist, not a behavioral geneticist, but my reading of this, my interpretation

2:01:41.900 --> 2:01:50.880
 of this is that there is a genetic blueprint, more or less, and that has a profound influence

2:01:50.880 --> 2:01:56.700
 on your subsequent intellectual development, including the G factor.

2:01:56.700 --> 2:02:03.900
 And that's not to say things can't happen to, I mean, if you think of that genes provide

2:02:03.900 --> 2:02:12.060
 a potential, fine, and then various variables impact that potential, and every parent of

2:02:12.060 --> 2:02:19.520
 a newborn, implicitly or explicitly, wants to maximize that potential.

2:02:19.520 --> 2:02:21.980
 This is why you buy educational toys.

2:02:21.980 --> 2:02:25.660
 This is why you pay attention to organic baby food.

2:02:25.660 --> 2:02:31.620
 This is why you do all these things, because you want your baby to be as healthy and as

2:02:31.620 --> 2:02:36.000
 smart as possible, and every parent will say that.

2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:45.220
 Is there a case to be made, can you steel man the case, that genetics is a very tiny

2:02:45.220 --> 2:02:49.420
 component of all of this, and the environment is essential?

2:02:49.420 --> 2:02:53.460
 I don't think the data supports that genetics is a tiny component.

2:02:53.460 --> 2:02:58.260
 I think the data support the idea that the genetics is a very important, and I don't

2:02:58.260 --> 2:03:05.740
 say component, I say influence, a very important influence, and the environment is a lot less

2:03:05.740 --> 2:03:07.900
 than people believe.

2:03:07.900 --> 2:03:10.700
 Most people believe environment plays a big role.

2:03:10.700 --> 2:03:11.700
 I'm not so sure.

2:03:11.700 --> 2:03:19.420
 I guess what I'm asking you is, can you see where what you just said, it might be wrong?

2:03:19.420 --> 2:03:27.140
 Can you imagine a world, and what kind of evidence would you need to see to say, you

2:03:27.140 --> 2:03:31.700
 know what, the intuition, the studies so far, like reversing the directions.

2:03:31.700 --> 2:03:36.140
 So one of the cool things we have now more and more is we're getting more and more data,

2:03:36.140 --> 2:03:41.860
 and the rate of the data is escalating because of the digital world.

2:03:41.860 --> 2:03:48.700
 So when you start to look at a very large scale of data, both on the biology side and

2:03:48.700 --> 2:03:53.860
 the social side, we might be discovering some very counterintuitive things about society.

2:03:53.860 --> 2:04:00.300
 We might see the edge cases that reveal that if we actually scale those edge cases and

2:04:00.300 --> 2:04:08.080
 they become like the norm, that we'll have a complete shift in our, like you'll see G

2:04:08.080 --> 2:04:15.300
 factor be able to be modified throughout life in the teens and in later life.

2:04:15.300 --> 2:04:20.700
 So is it any case you can make or for where your current intuitions are wrong?

2:04:20.700 --> 2:04:25.300
 Yes, and it's a good question because I think everyone should always be asked what evidence

2:04:25.300 --> 2:04:28.020
 would change your mind.

2:04:28.020 --> 2:04:32.860
 It's certainly not only a fair question, it is really the key question for anybody working

2:04:32.860 --> 2:04:36.580
 on any aspect of science.

2:04:36.580 --> 2:04:45.900
 I think that if environment was very important, we would have seen it clearly by now.

2:04:45.900 --> 2:04:53.660
 It would have been obvious that school interventions, compensatory education, early childhood education,

2:04:53.660 --> 2:04:59.340
 all these things that have been earnestly tried in well funded, well designed studies

2:04:59.340 --> 2:05:02.940
 would show some effect, and they don't.

2:05:02.940 --> 2:05:08.260
 What if the school, the way we've tried school, compensatory school sucks and we need to do

2:05:08.260 --> 2:05:09.260
 better?

2:05:09.260 --> 2:05:10.260
 That's what everybody said at the beginning.

2:05:10.260 --> 2:05:11.760
 That's what everybody said to Jensen.

2:05:11.760 --> 2:05:15.720
 He said, well, maybe we need to start earlier.

2:05:15.720 --> 2:05:20.320
 Maybe we need not do prekindergarten, but pre, prekindergarten.

2:05:20.320 --> 2:05:24.620
 It's always an infinite, well, maybe we didn't get it right.

2:05:24.620 --> 2:05:33.580
 But after decades of trying, 50 years, 50 or 60 years of trying, surely something would

2:05:33.580 --> 2:05:39.700
 have worked to the point where you could actually see a result and not need a probability level

2:05:39.700 --> 2:05:42.540
 at 0.05 on some means.

2:05:42.540 --> 2:05:49.380
 So that's why I, that's the kind of evidence that would change my mind.

2:05:49.380 --> 2:05:56.940
 Population level interventions like schooling that you would see like this actually has

2:05:56.940 --> 2:05:57.940
 an effect.

2:05:57.940 --> 2:05:58.940
 Yes.

2:05:58.940 --> 2:06:04.940
 And when you take adopted kids and they grow up in another family and you find out when

2:06:04.940 --> 2:06:09.980
 those adopted kids are adults, their IQ scores don't correlate with the IQ scores of their

2:06:09.980 --> 2:06:15.820
 adoptive parents, but they do correlate with their IQ scores of their biological parents

2:06:15.820 --> 2:06:18.860
 whom they've never met.

2:06:18.860 --> 2:06:22.100
 I mean, these are important, these are powerful observations.

2:06:22.100 --> 2:06:26.500
 And it would be convincing to you if the reverse was true.

2:06:26.500 --> 2:06:27.500
 Yes.

2:06:27.500 --> 2:06:28.500
 That would be more.

2:06:28.500 --> 2:06:35.180
 And there is some data on adoption that indicates that the adopted children are moving a little

2:06:35.180 --> 2:06:40.220
 bit more toward their adoptive parents.

2:06:40.220 --> 2:06:47.500
 But it's to me the overwhelming, I have this concept called the weight of evidence where

2:06:47.500 --> 2:06:50.500
 I don't interpret any one study too much.

2:06:50.500 --> 2:06:53.540
 The weight of evidence tells me genes are important.

2:06:53.540 --> 2:06:54.780
 But what does that mean?

2:06:54.780 --> 2:06:57.100
 What does it mean that genes are important?

2:06:57.100 --> 2:07:03.180
 Knowing that gene expression, genes don't express themselves in a vacuum, they express

2:07:03.180 --> 2:07:05.900
 themselves in an environment.

2:07:05.900 --> 2:07:10.300
 So the environment has to have something to do with it, especially if the best genetic

2:07:10.300 --> 2:07:17.740
 estimates of the amount of variants are around 50 or even if it's as high as 80%, it still

2:07:17.740 --> 2:07:21.540
 leaves 20% of non genetic.

2:07:21.540 --> 2:07:24.300
 Now maybe that is all luck.

2:07:24.300 --> 2:07:25.580
 Maybe that's all chance.

2:07:25.580 --> 2:07:31.320
 I could believe that, I could easily believe that.

2:07:31.320 --> 2:07:39.060
 But I do think after 50 years of trying various interventions and nothing works, including

2:07:39.060 --> 2:07:44.340
 memory training, including listening to Mozart, including playing computer games, none of

2:07:44.340 --> 2:07:49.060
 that has shown any impact on intelligence test scores.

2:07:49.060 --> 2:07:57.140
 Is there data on the intelligence, the IQ of parents as it relates to the children?

2:07:57.140 --> 2:08:07.020
 Yes, and there is some genetic evidence of an interaction between the parents IQ and

2:08:07.020 --> 2:08:08.760
 the environment.

2:08:08.760 --> 2:08:17.020
 High IQ parents provide an enriched environment, which then can impact the child in addition

2:08:17.020 --> 2:08:20.020
 to the genes, it's that environment.

2:08:20.020 --> 2:08:29.060
 So there are all these interactions that, think about the number of books in a household.

2:08:29.060 --> 2:08:37.140
 This was a variable that's correlated with IQ and, well, why?

2:08:37.140 --> 2:08:42.900
 Especially if the kid never reads any of the books, it's because more intelligent people

2:08:42.900 --> 2:08:45.620
 have more books in their house.

2:08:45.620 --> 2:08:52.500
 And if you're more intelligent and there's a genetic component to that, the child will

2:08:52.500 --> 2:08:57.480
 get those genes or some of those genes as well as the environment.

2:08:57.480 --> 2:09:04.140
 But it's not the number of books in the house that actually directly impacts the child.

2:09:04.140 --> 2:09:11.620
 So the two scenarios on this are you find that, and this was used to get rid of the

2:09:11.620 --> 2:09:18.300
 SAT test, oh, the SAT score is highly correlated with the social economic status of the parents.

2:09:18.300 --> 2:09:21.540
 So all you're really measuring is how rich the parents are.

2:09:21.540 --> 2:09:27.620
 Okay, well, why are the parents rich?

2:09:27.620 --> 2:09:37.940
 And so the opposite kind of syllogism is that people who are very bright make more money,

2:09:37.940 --> 2:09:44.540
 they can afford homes in better neighborhoods so their kids get better schools.

2:09:44.540 --> 2:09:47.780
 Now the kids grow up bright.

2:09:47.780 --> 2:09:51.340
 Where in that chain of events does that come from?

2:09:51.340 --> 2:09:58.720
 Well, unless you have a genetically informative research design where you look at siblings

2:09:58.720 --> 2:10:05.940
 that have the same biological parents and so on, you can't really disentangle all that.

2:10:05.940 --> 2:10:12.820
 Most studies of social economic status and intelligence do not have a genetically informed

2:10:12.820 --> 2:10:13.940
 design.

2:10:13.940 --> 2:10:20.580
 So any conclusions they make about the causality of the social economic status being the cause

2:10:20.580 --> 2:10:25.540
 of the IQ is a stretch.

2:10:25.540 --> 2:10:33.140
 And where you do find genetically informative designs, you find most of the variance in

2:10:33.140 --> 2:10:38.980
 your outcome measures are due to the genetic component.

2:10:38.980 --> 2:10:46.480
 And sometimes the SES adds a little, but the weight of evidence is it doesn't add very

2:10:46.480 --> 2:10:52.660
 much variance to predict what's going on beyond the genetic variance.

2:10:52.660 --> 2:10:58.780
 So when you actually look at it in some, and there aren't that many studies that have genetically

2:10:58.780 --> 2:11:05.060
 informed designs, but when you do see those, the genes seem to have an advantage.

2:11:05.060 --> 2:11:13.620
 Sorry for the strange questions, but is there a connection between fertility or the number

2:11:13.620 --> 2:11:16.860
 of kids that you have and G factor?

2:11:16.860 --> 2:11:25.600
 So you know, the kind of conventional wisdom is people of maybe higher economic status

2:11:25.600 --> 2:11:28.180
 or something like that are having fewer children.

2:11:28.180 --> 2:11:30.900
 I just loosely hear these kinds of things.

2:11:30.900 --> 2:11:36.580
 Is there data that you're aware of in one direction or another on this?

2:11:36.580 --> 2:11:39.060
 Strange questions always get strange answers.

2:11:39.060 --> 2:11:40.060
 Yes.

2:11:40.060 --> 2:11:41.060
 All right.

2:11:41.060 --> 2:11:44.740
 Do you have a strange answer for that strange question?

2:11:44.740 --> 2:11:54.540
 The answer is there were some studies that indicated the more children in a family, the

2:11:54.540 --> 2:12:00.740
 firstborn children would be more intelligent than the fourth or fifth or sixth.

2:12:00.740 --> 2:12:05.500
 It's not clear that those studies hold up over time.

2:12:05.500 --> 2:12:14.020
 And of course what you see also is that families where there are multiple children, four, five,

2:12:14.020 --> 2:12:23.580
 six, seven, you know, really big families, the social economic status of those families

2:12:23.580 --> 2:12:28.700
 usually in the modern age is not that high.

2:12:28.700 --> 2:12:33.500
 Maybe it used to be the aristocracy used to have a lot of kids, I'm not sure exactly.

2:12:33.500 --> 2:12:44.020
 But there have been reports of correlations between IQ and fertility, but I'm not sure

2:12:44.020 --> 2:12:50.500
 that the data are very strong that the firstborn child is always the smartest.

2:12:50.500 --> 2:12:54.980
 It seems like there's some data to that, but I'm not current on that.

2:12:54.980 --> 2:12:55.980
 How would that be explained?

2:12:55.980 --> 2:12:58.260
 That would be in a nurture.

2:12:58.260 --> 2:13:08.500
 Well, it could be nurture, it could be in uterine environment, I mean, and this is why

2:13:08.500 --> 2:13:14.740
 this, you know, like many areas of science, you said earlier that there are a lot of gray

2:13:14.740 --> 2:13:21.660
 areas and no definitive answers.

2:13:21.660 --> 2:13:28.900
 This is not uncommon in science that the closer you look at a problem, the more questions

2:13:28.900 --> 2:13:35.820
 you get, not the fewer questions, because the universe is complicated.

2:13:35.820 --> 2:13:42.980
 And the idea that we have people on this planet who can study the first nanoseconds of the

2:13:42.980 --> 2:13:48.260
 Big Bang, that's pretty amazing.

2:13:48.260 --> 2:13:53.340
 And I've always said that if they can study the first nanoseconds of the Big Bang, we

2:13:53.340 --> 2:13:58.900
 can certainly figure out something about intelligence that allows that.

2:13:58.900 --> 2:14:06.020
 I'm not sure what's more complicated, the human mind or the physics of the universe.

2:14:06.020 --> 2:14:08.220
 It's unclear to me.

2:14:08.220 --> 2:14:09.220
 I think we overemphasize.

2:14:09.220 --> 2:14:13.220
 Well, that's a very humbling statement.

2:14:13.220 --> 2:14:18.100
 Maybe it's a very human centric, egotistical statement that our mind is somehow super complicated,

2:14:18.100 --> 2:14:22.860
 but biology is a tricky one to unravel.

2:14:22.860 --> 2:14:27.100
 Consciousness, what is that?

2:14:27.100 --> 2:14:34.180
 I've always believed that consciousness and intelligence are the two real fundamental

2:14:34.180 --> 2:14:41.380
 problems of the human brain, and therefore I think they must be related.

2:14:41.380 --> 2:14:49.060
 Yeah, heart problems like walk together, holding hands kind of idea.

2:14:49.060 --> 2:14:54.180
 You may not know this, but I did some of the early research on anesthetic drugs with brain

2:14:54.180 --> 2:14:58.900
 imaging trying to answer the question, what part of the brain is the last to turn off

2:14:58.900 --> 2:15:01.520
 when someone loses consciousness?

2:15:01.520 --> 2:15:07.060
 And is that the first part of the brain to turn on when consciousness is regained?

2:15:07.060 --> 2:15:11.060
 And I was working with an anesthesiologist named Mike Alkire, who was really brilliant

2:15:11.060 --> 2:15:12.060
 at this.

2:15:12.060 --> 2:15:18.300
 These were really the first studies of brain imaging using positron emission tomography

2:15:18.300 --> 2:15:21.700
 long before fMRI.

2:15:21.700 --> 2:15:28.220
 And you would inject a radioactive sugar that labeled the brain, and the harder the brain

2:15:28.220 --> 2:15:33.980
 was working, the more sugar it would take up, and then you could make a picture of glucose

2:15:33.980 --> 2:15:36.420
 use in the brain.

2:15:36.420 --> 2:15:38.560
 And he was amazing.

2:15:38.560 --> 2:15:44.860
 He managed to do this in normal volunteers he brought in and anesthetized as if they

2:15:44.860 --> 2:15:49.060
 were going into surgery.

2:15:49.060 --> 2:15:55.380
 He managed all the human subjects requirements on this research, and he was brilliant at

2:15:55.380 --> 2:15:57.100
 this.

2:15:57.100 --> 2:16:05.140
 And what we did is we had these normal volunteers come in on three occasions.

2:16:05.140 --> 2:16:14.800
 On one occasion, he gave them enough anesthetic drug so they were a little drowsy.

2:16:14.800 --> 2:16:20.780
 And on another occasion, they came in and he fully anesthetized them.

2:16:20.780 --> 2:16:31.820
 And he would say, Mike, can you hear me, and the person would say, uh, yeah.

2:16:31.820 --> 2:16:37.540
 And then we would scan people under no anesthetic condition.

2:16:37.540 --> 2:16:39.980
 So same person.

2:16:39.980 --> 2:16:46.780
 And we were looking to see if we could see the part of the brain turn off.

2:16:46.780 --> 2:16:51.980
 He subsequently tried to do this with fMRI, which has a faster time resolution, and you

2:16:51.980 --> 2:16:56.780
 could do it in real time as the person went under and then regain consciousness where

2:16:56.780 --> 2:16:57.980
 you couldn't do that with PET.

2:16:57.980 --> 2:17:00.780
 You had to have three different occasions.

2:17:00.780 --> 2:17:03.380
 And the results were absolutely fascinating.

2:17:03.380 --> 2:17:08.600
 We did this with different anesthetic drugs, and different drugs impacted different parts

2:17:08.600 --> 2:17:09.780
 of the brain.

2:17:09.780 --> 2:17:15.820
 So we were naturally looking for the common one, and it seemed to have something to do

2:17:15.820 --> 2:17:18.300
 with the thalamus.

2:17:18.300 --> 2:17:25.740
 And consciousness, this was actual data on consciousness, actual consciousness.

2:17:25.740 --> 2:17:28.420
 What part of the brain turns on?

2:17:28.420 --> 2:17:30.900
 What part of the brain turns off?

2:17:30.900 --> 2:17:33.220
 It's not so clear.

2:17:33.220 --> 2:17:35.940
 But maybe has something to do with the thalamus.

2:17:35.940 --> 2:17:41.180
 The sequence of events seemed to have the thalamus in it.

2:17:41.180 --> 2:17:42.700
 Now here's the question.

2:17:42.700 --> 2:17:45.780
 Are some people more conscious than others?

2:17:45.780 --> 2:17:49.660
 Are there individual differences in consciousness?

2:17:49.660 --> 2:17:53.020
 And I don't mean it in the psychedelic sense.

2:17:53.020 --> 2:17:55.780
 I don't mean it in the political consciousness sense.

2:17:55.780 --> 2:17:57.300
 I just mean it in everyday life.

2:17:57.300 --> 2:18:01.900
 Do some people go through everyday life more conscious than others?

2:18:01.900 --> 2:18:06.700
 And are those the people we might actually label more intelligent?

2:18:06.700 --> 2:18:11.700
 Now the other thing I was looking for is whether the parts of the brain we were seeing in the

2:18:11.700 --> 2:18:16.820
 anesthesia studies were the same parts of the brain we were seeing in the intelligence

2:18:16.820 --> 2:18:17.820
 studies.

2:18:17.820 --> 2:18:22.580
 Now, this was very complicated, expensive research.

2:18:22.580 --> 2:18:24.500
 We didn't really have funding to do this.

2:18:24.500 --> 2:18:26.260
 We were trying to do it on the fly.

2:18:26.260 --> 2:18:29.660
 I'm not sure anybody has pursued this.

2:18:29.660 --> 2:18:31.740
 I'm retired now.

2:18:31.740 --> 2:18:34.100
 He's gone on to other things.

2:18:34.100 --> 2:18:41.020
 But I think it's an area of research that would be fascinating to see the parts, a lot

2:18:41.020 --> 2:18:43.140
 more imaging studies now of consciousness.

2:18:43.140 --> 2:18:45.260
 I'm just not up on them.

2:18:45.260 --> 2:18:52.460
 But basically the question is which imaging, so newer imaging studies to see in high resolution,

2:18:52.460 --> 2:18:59.260
 spatial and temporal way, which part of the brain lights up when you're doing intelligence

2:18:59.260 --> 2:19:03.700
 tasks and which parts of the brain lights up when you're doing consciousness tasks and

2:19:03.700 --> 2:19:09.460
 see the interplay between them, try to infer, that's the challenge of neuroscience, without

2:19:09.460 --> 2:19:18.260
 understanding deeply, looking from the outside, try to infer something about how the whole

2:19:18.260 --> 2:19:19.260
 thing works.

2:19:19.260 --> 2:19:21.220
 Well, imagine this.

2:19:21.220 --> 2:19:23.160
 Here's a simple question.

2:19:23.160 --> 2:19:33.460
 Does it take more anesthetic drug to have a person lose consciousness if their IQ is

2:19:33.460 --> 2:19:39.060
 140 than a person with an IQ of 70?

2:19:39.060 --> 2:19:40.660
 That's an interesting way to study it.

2:19:40.660 --> 2:19:41.660
 Yeah.

2:19:41.660 --> 2:19:48.060
 I mean, if the answer to that is a stable yes, that's very interesting.

2:19:48.060 --> 2:19:55.700
 So I tried to find out and I went to some anesthesiology textbooks about how you dose

2:19:55.700 --> 2:19:59.620
 and they dose by weight.

2:19:59.620 --> 2:20:07.440
 And what I also learned, this is a little bit off subject, anesthesiologists are never

2:20:07.440 --> 2:20:10.980
 sure how deep you are.

2:20:10.980 --> 2:20:14.780
 And they usually tell by poking you with a needle and if you don't jump, they tell the

2:20:14.780 --> 2:20:17.100
 surgeon to go ahead.

2:20:17.100 --> 2:20:20.460
 I'm not sure that's literally true, but it's...

2:20:20.460 --> 2:20:26.380
 Well, it might be very difficult to know precisely how deep you are.

2:20:26.380 --> 2:20:31.860
 It has to do with the same kind of measurements that you were doing with the consciousness.

2:20:31.860 --> 2:20:34.740
 It's difficult to know.

2:20:34.740 --> 2:20:35.940
 So I don't lose my train of thought.

2:20:35.940 --> 2:20:40.980
 I couldn't find in the textbooks anything about dosing by intelligence.

2:20:40.980 --> 2:20:45.620
 I asked my friend, the anesthesiologist, he said, no, he doesn't know.

2:20:45.620 --> 2:20:52.220
 I said, can we do a chart review and look at people using their years of education as

2:20:52.220 --> 2:20:54.420
 a proxy for IQ?

2:20:54.420 --> 2:20:58.340
 Because if someone's gone to graduate school, that tells you something.

2:20:58.340 --> 2:21:02.780
 You can make some inference as opposed to someone who didn't graduate high school.

2:21:02.780 --> 2:21:03.980
 Can we do a chart review?

2:21:03.980 --> 2:21:08.460
 And he says, no, they never really put down the exact dose.

2:21:08.460 --> 2:21:10.620
 And no, he said, no.

2:21:10.620 --> 2:21:18.820
 So to this day, the simple question, does it take more anesthetic drug to put someone

2:21:18.820 --> 2:21:23.440
 under if they have a high IQ or less, or less?

2:21:23.440 --> 2:21:24.440
 It could go either way.

2:21:24.440 --> 2:21:33.780
 Because by the way, our early PET scan studies of intelligence found the unexpected result

2:21:33.780 --> 2:21:38.540
 of an inverse correlation between glucose metabolic rate and intelligence.

2:21:38.540 --> 2:21:43.020
 It wasn't how much a brain area lit up.

2:21:43.020 --> 2:21:48.380
 How much it lit up was negatively correlated to how well they did on the test, which led

2:21:48.380 --> 2:21:54.140
 to the brain efficiency hypothesis, which is still being studied today.

2:21:54.140 --> 2:22:00.280
 And there's more and more evidence that the efficiency of brain information processing

2:22:00.280 --> 2:22:08.780
 is more related to intelligence than just more activity.

2:22:08.780 --> 2:22:14.180
 Yeah, and it'll be interesting, again, this is the total hypothesis, how much in the relationship

2:22:14.180 --> 2:22:22.060
 between intelligence and consciousness, it's not obvious that those two, if there's correlation,

2:22:22.060 --> 2:22:23.860
 they could be inversely correlated.

2:22:23.860 --> 2:22:26.060
 Wouldn't that be funny?

2:22:26.060 --> 2:22:38.340
 If you, the consciousness factor, the C factor plus the G factor equals one.

2:22:38.340 --> 2:22:43.420
 It's a nice trade off, you get a trade off, how deeply you experience the world versus

2:22:43.420 --> 2:22:48.140
 how deeply you're able to reason through the world.

2:22:48.140 --> 2:22:51.060
 What a great hypothesis.

2:22:51.060 --> 2:22:54.140
 Certainly somebody listening to this can do this study.

2:22:54.140 --> 2:22:59.740
 Even if it's the aliens analyzing humans a few centuries from now, let me ask you from

2:22:59.740 --> 2:23:08.600
 an AI perspective, I don't know how much you've thought about machines, but there's the famous

2:23:08.600 --> 2:23:17.220
 Turing test, test of intelligence for machines, which is a beautiful, almost like a cute formulation

2:23:17.220 --> 2:23:24.220
 of intelligence that Alan Turing proposed.

2:23:24.220 --> 2:23:33.420
 Basically conversation being, if you can fool a human to think that a machine is a human

2:23:33.420 --> 2:23:40.620
 that passes the test, I suppose you could do a similar thing for humans.

2:23:40.620 --> 2:23:48.700
 If I can fool you that I'm intelligent, then that's a good test of intelligence.

2:23:48.700 --> 2:24:02.500
 You're talking to two people, and the test is saying who has a higher IQ.

2:24:02.500 --> 2:24:07.960
 It's an interesting test, because maybe charisma can be very useful there, and you're only

2:24:07.960 --> 2:24:11.340
 allowed to use conversation, which is the formulation of the Turing test.

2:24:11.340 --> 2:24:18.700
 Anyway, all that to say is what are good tests of intelligence for machines?

2:24:18.700 --> 2:24:23.700
 What do you think it takes to achieve human level intelligence for machines?

2:24:23.700 --> 2:24:30.760
 I have thought a little bit about this, but every time I think about these things, I rapidly

2:24:30.760 --> 2:24:37.580
 reach the limits of my knowledge and imagination.

2:24:37.580 --> 2:24:47.460
 When Alexa first came out, and I think there was a competing one, well, there was Siri

2:24:47.460 --> 2:24:50.100
 with Apple, and Google had Alexa.

2:24:50.100 --> 2:24:52.660
 No, no, Amazon had Alexa.

2:24:52.660 --> 2:24:53.660
 Amazon had Alexa.

2:24:53.660 --> 2:24:54.660
 Google has Google Home.

2:24:54.660 --> 2:24:55.660
 Google has something.

2:24:55.660 --> 2:25:04.020
 I proposed to one of my colleagues that he buy one of these, one of each, and then ask

2:25:04.020 --> 2:25:09.020
 it questions from the IQ test.

2:25:09.020 --> 2:25:15.860
 But it became apparent that they all searched the internet, so they all can find answers

2:25:15.860 --> 2:25:22.540
 to questions like how far is it between Washington and Miami, and repeat after me.

2:25:22.540 --> 2:25:29.620
 Now, I don't know if you said to Alexa, I'm going to repeat these numbers backwards to

2:25:29.620 --> 2:25:30.620
 me.

2:25:30.620 --> 2:25:31.620
 I don't know what would happen.

2:25:31.620 --> 2:25:33.620
 I've never done it.

2:25:33.620 --> 2:25:38.060
 So one answer to your question is you're going to try it right now.

2:25:38.060 --> 2:25:39.060
 Let's try it.

2:25:39.060 --> 2:25:40.060
 No.

2:25:40.060 --> 2:25:41.060
 Let's try it.

2:25:41.060 --> 2:25:42.060
 No, no, no.

2:25:42.060 --> 2:25:43.060
 Yes, Siri.

2:25:43.060 --> 2:25:47.500
 So it would actually probably go to Google search, and it will be all confusing kind

2:25:47.500 --> 2:25:49.500
 of stuff.

2:25:49.500 --> 2:25:50.500
 It would fail.

2:25:50.500 --> 2:25:53.980
 Well, then I guess there was a test that it would fail.

2:25:53.980 --> 2:26:02.560
 Well, but that's not, that has to do more with the language of communication versus

2:26:02.560 --> 2:26:03.740
 the content.

2:26:03.740 --> 2:26:09.300
 So if you did an IQ test to a person who doesn't speak English, and the test was administered

2:26:09.300 --> 2:26:11.660
 in English, that's not really the test of...

2:26:11.660 --> 2:26:15.740
 Well, let's think about the computers that beat the Jeopardy champions.

2:26:15.740 --> 2:26:21.760
 Yeah, so that, because I happen to know how those are programmed, those are very hard

2:26:21.760 --> 2:26:25.660
 coded, and there's definitely a lack of intelligence there.

2:26:25.660 --> 2:26:36.060
 There's something like IQ tests, there's a guy, an artificial intelligence researcher,

2:26:36.060 --> 2:26:40.980
 Francois Chollet, he's at Google, he's one of the seminal people in machine learning.

2:26:40.980 --> 2:26:45.860
 He also, as a fun aside thing, developed an IQ test for machines.

2:26:45.860 --> 2:26:47.660
 Oh, I haven't heard that.

2:26:47.660 --> 2:26:49.580
 I'd just like to know about that.

2:26:49.580 --> 2:26:53.340
 I'll actually email you this, because it'd be very interesting for you.

2:26:53.340 --> 2:26:59.900
 It doesn't get much attention, because people don't know what to do with it, but it deserves

2:26:59.900 --> 2:27:06.180
 a lot of attention, which is, it basically does a pattern type of tests, where you have

2:27:06.180 --> 2:27:12.740
 to do, you know, one standard one is, you're given three things, and you have to do a fourth

2:27:12.740 --> 2:27:17.120
 one, that kind of thing, so you have to understand the pattern here.

2:27:17.120 --> 2:27:28.740
 And for that, it really simplifies to, so the interesting thing is, he's trying not

2:27:28.740 --> 2:27:35.300
 to achieve high IQ, he's trying to achieve like, pretty low bar for IQ.

2:27:35.300 --> 2:27:42.060
 Things that are kind of trivial for humans, and they're actually really tough for machines.

2:27:42.060 --> 2:27:49.420
 It's just seeing, playing with these concepts of symmetry, of counting, like if I give you

2:27:49.420 --> 2:27:54.980
 one object, two objects, three objects, you'll know the last one is four objects, you can

2:27:54.980 --> 2:28:01.300
 like count them, you can cluster objects together, it's both visually and conceptually, we can

2:28:01.300 --> 2:28:07.420
 do all these things with our mind, that we take for granted, the objectness of things.

2:28:07.420 --> 2:28:14.740
 You can like, figure out what spatially is an object and isn't, and we can play with

2:28:14.740 --> 2:28:21.540
 those ideas, and machines really struggle with that, so he really cleanly formulated

2:28:21.540 --> 2:28:27.340
 these IQ tests, I wonder what like, that would equate to for humans with IQ, but it'd be

2:28:27.340 --> 2:28:33.940
 a very low IQ, but that's exactly the kind of formulation, like okay, we want to be able

2:28:33.940 --> 2:28:38.060
 to solve this, how do we solve this, and he does it as a challenge, and nobody's been

2:28:38.060 --> 2:28:44.260
 able to, it's similar to the Alexa prize, which is Amazon is hosting a conversational

2:28:44.260 --> 2:28:51.440
 challenge, nobody's been able to do well on his, but that's an interesting, those kinds

2:28:51.440 --> 2:28:58.500
 of tests are interesting, because we take for granted all the ability of the human mind

2:28:58.500 --> 2:29:08.620
 to play with concepts, and to formulate concepts out of novel things, so like, things we've

2:29:08.620 --> 2:29:14.440
 never seen before, we're able to use that, I mean that's, I've talked to a few people

2:29:14.440 --> 2:29:20.540
 that design IQ tests, sort of online, they write IQ tests, and I was trying to get some

2:29:20.540 --> 2:29:25.180
 questions from them, and they spoke to the fact that we can't really share questions

2:29:25.180 --> 2:29:31.980
 with you, because part of the, like first of all, it's really hard work to come up with

2:29:31.980 --> 2:29:37.240
 questions, it's really, really hard work, it takes a lot of research, but it also takes

2:29:37.240 --> 2:29:46.060
 a lot, it's novelty generating, you're constantly coming up with really new things, and part

2:29:46.060 --> 2:29:51.380
 of the point is that they're not supposed to be public, they're supposed to be new

2:29:51.380 --> 2:29:56.700
 to you when you look at them, it's interesting that the novelty is fundamental to the hardness

2:29:56.700 --> 2:30:02.320
 of the problem, at least a part of what makes the problem hard is that you've never seen

2:30:02.320 --> 2:30:03.320
 it before.

2:30:03.320 --> 2:30:08.860
 Right, that's called fluid intelligence, as opposed to what's called crystallized intelligence,

2:30:08.860 --> 2:30:16.200
 which is your knowledge of facts, you know things, but can you use those things to solve

2:30:16.200 --> 2:30:19.500
 a problem, those are two different things.

2:30:19.500 --> 2:30:25.180
 Do you think we'll be able to, because we spoke, I don't want to miss opportunity to

2:30:25.180 --> 2:30:30.300
 talk about this, we spoke about the neurobiology, about the molecular biology of intelligence,

2:30:30.300 --> 2:30:39.460
 do you think one day we'll be able to modify the biology of, or the genetics of a person

2:30:39.460 --> 2:30:45.040
 to modify their intelligence, to increase their intelligence, we started this conversation

2:30:45.040 --> 2:30:49.020
 by talking about a pill you could take, do you think that such a pill would exist?

2:30:49.020 --> 2:30:57.900
 Metaphorically, I do, and I am supremely confident that it's possible because I am supremely

2:30:57.900 --> 2:31:07.220
 ignorant of the complexities of neurobiology, and so I have written that the nightmares

2:31:07.220 --> 2:31:15.860
 of neurobiologists, understanding the complexities, this cascade of events that happens at the

2:31:15.860 --> 2:31:25.060
 synaptic level, that these nightmares are what fuel some people to solve.

2:31:25.060 --> 2:31:31.520
 So some people, you have to be undaunted, I mean yeah, this is not easy, look we're

2:31:31.520 --> 2:31:38.660
 still trying to figure out cancer, it was only recently that they figured out why aspirin

2:31:38.660 --> 2:31:47.980
 works, you know, these are not easy problems, but I also have the perspective of the history

2:31:47.980 --> 2:31:57.580
 of science, is the history of solving problems that are extraordinarily complex.

2:31:57.580 --> 2:31:58.740
 And seem impossible at the time.

2:31:58.740 --> 2:32:01.140
 And seem impossible at the time.

2:32:01.140 --> 2:32:08.460
 And so one of the things you look at, at companies like Neuralink, you have brain computer interfaces,

2:32:08.460 --> 2:32:12.500
 you start to delve into the human mind and start to talk about machines measuring but

2:32:12.500 --> 2:32:19.180
 also sending signals to the human mind, and you start to wonder what that has, what impact

2:32:19.180 --> 2:32:23.700
 that has on the G factor.

2:32:23.700 --> 2:32:32.420
 Modifying in small ways or in large ways the functioning, the mechanical, electrical, chemical

2:32:32.420 --> 2:32:34.140
 functioning of the brain.

2:32:34.140 --> 2:32:39.860
 I look at everything about the brain, there are different levels of explanation.

2:32:39.860 --> 2:32:46.420
 On one hand you have a behavioral level, but then you have brain circuitry, and then you

2:32:46.420 --> 2:32:57.380
 have neurons, and then you have dendrites, and then you have synapses, and then you have

2:32:57.380 --> 2:33:06.580
 the neurotransmitters, and the presynaptic and the postsynaptic terminals, and then you

2:33:06.580 --> 2:33:13.980
 have all the things that influence neurotransmitters, and then you have the individual differences

2:33:13.980 --> 2:33:15.460
 among people.

2:33:15.460 --> 2:33:27.540
 Yeah, it's complicated, but 51 million people in the United States have IQs under 85 and

2:33:27.540 --> 2:33:32.540
 struggle with everyday life.

2:33:32.540 --> 2:33:37.140
 Shouldn't that motivate people to take a look at this?

2:33:37.140 --> 2:33:46.220
 Yeah, but I just want to linger one more time that you have to remember that the science

2:33:46.220 --> 2:33:54.740
 of intelligence, the measure of intelligence is only a part of the human condition.

2:33:54.740 --> 2:33:59.260
 The thing that makes life beautiful and the creation of beautiful things in this world

2:33:59.260 --> 2:34:08.860
 is perhaps loosely correlated, but is not dependent entirely on intelligence.

2:34:08.860 --> 2:34:12.220
 Absolutely, I certainly agree with that.

2:34:12.220 --> 2:34:22.660
 So for anyone sort of listening, I'm still not convinced that more intelligence is always

2:34:22.660 --> 2:34:26.060
 better if you want to create beauty in this world.

2:34:26.060 --> 2:34:27.060
 I don't know.

2:34:27.060 --> 2:34:31.340
 Well, I didn't say more intelligence is always better if you want to create beauty.

2:34:31.340 --> 2:34:36.460
 I just said all things being equal, more is better than less.

2:34:36.460 --> 2:34:37.460
 That's all I mean.

2:34:37.460 --> 2:34:42.980
 Yeah, but that's sort of that I just want to sort of say because a lot to me, one of

2:34:42.980 --> 2:34:50.380
 the things that makes life great is the opportunity to create beautiful things, and so I just

2:34:50.380 --> 2:34:56.380
 want to sort of empower people to do that no matter what some IQ test says.

2:34:56.380 --> 2:35:02.420
 At the population level, we do need to look at IQ tests to help people and to also inspire

2:35:02.420 --> 2:35:07.900
 us to take on some of these extremely difficult scientific questions.

2:35:07.900 --> 2:35:16.860
 Do you have advice for young people in high school, in college, whether they're thinking

2:35:16.860 --> 2:35:20.740
 about career or they're thinking about a life they can be proud of?

2:35:20.740 --> 2:35:29.760
 Is there advice you can give whether they want to pursue psychology or biology or engineering

2:35:29.760 --> 2:35:33.700
 or they want to be artists and musicians and poets?

2:35:33.700 --> 2:35:43.320
 I can't advise anybody on that level of what their passion is, but I can say if you're

2:35:43.320 --> 2:35:52.840
 interested in psychology or if you're interested in science and the science around the big

2:35:52.840 --> 2:36:00.640
 questions of consciousness and intelligence and psychiatric illness, we haven't really

2:36:00.640 --> 2:36:07.020
 talked about brain illnesses and what we might learn from.

2:36:07.020 --> 2:36:12.540
 If you are trying to develop a drug to treat Alzheimer's disease, you are trying to develop

2:36:12.540 --> 2:36:20.420
 a drug to impact learning and memory, which are core to intelligence.

2:36:20.420 --> 2:36:26.100
 So it could well be that the so called IQ pill will come from a pharmaceutical company

2:36:26.100 --> 2:36:29.460
 trying to develop a drug for Alzheimer's disease.

2:36:29.460 --> 2:36:33.540
 Because that's exactly what you're trying to do, right, yeah, just like you said.

2:36:33.540 --> 2:36:38.460
 What will that drug do in a college student that doesn't have Alzheimer's disease?

2:36:38.460 --> 2:36:47.740
 So I would encourage people who are interested in psychology, who are interested in science

2:36:47.740 --> 2:36:54.300
 to pursue a scientific career and address the big questions.

2:36:54.300 --> 2:37:03.080
 And the most important thing I can tell you if you're going to be in kind of a research

2:37:03.080 --> 2:37:07.420
 environment is you got to follow the data where the data take you.

2:37:07.420 --> 2:37:10.700
 You can't decide in advance where you want the data to go.

2:37:10.700 --> 2:37:16.300
 And if the data take you to places that you don't have the technical expertise to follow,

2:37:16.300 --> 2:37:21.940
 like you know, I would like to understand more about molecular biology, but I'm not

2:37:21.940 --> 2:37:24.940
 going to become a molecular biologist now.

2:37:24.940 --> 2:37:31.140
 But I know people who are, and my job is to get them interested to take their expertise

2:37:31.140 --> 2:37:33.640
 into this direction.

2:37:33.640 --> 2:37:36.580
 And that it's not so easy.

2:37:36.580 --> 2:37:41.820
 And if the data takes you to a place that's controversial, that's counterintuitive in

2:37:41.820 --> 2:37:52.460
 this world, no, I would say it's probably a good idea to still push forward boldly,

2:37:52.460 --> 2:38:01.380
 but to communicate the interpretation of the results with skill, with compassion, with

2:38:01.380 --> 2:38:07.700
 the greater breadth of understanding of humanity, not just the science, of the impact of the

2:38:07.700 --> 2:38:08.900
 results.

2:38:08.900 --> 2:38:16.340
 One famous psychologist wrote about this issue that somehow a balance has to be found between

2:38:16.340 --> 2:38:22.260
 pursuing the science and communicating it with respect to people's sensitivities, the

2:38:22.260 --> 2:38:26.020
 legitimate sensitivities, somehow.

2:38:26.020 --> 2:38:27.020
 He didn't say how.

2:38:27.020 --> 2:38:28.020
 Somehow.

2:38:28.020 --> 2:38:29.020
 Somehow.

2:38:29.020 --> 2:38:30.020
 And this is...

2:38:30.020 --> 2:38:37.500
 This sense, somehow, and balance is left up to the interpretation of the reader.

2:38:37.500 --> 2:38:44.220
 Let me ask you, you said big questions, the biggest, or one of the biggest, we already

2:38:44.220 --> 2:38:48.060
 talked about consciousness and intelligence, one of the most fascinating, one of the biggest

2:38:48.060 --> 2:38:49.060
 questions.

2:38:49.060 --> 2:38:51.420
 But let's talk about the why.

2:38:51.420 --> 2:38:53.420
 Why are we here?

2:38:53.420 --> 2:38:54.420
 What's the meaning of life?

2:38:54.420 --> 2:38:55.420
 I'm not going to tell you.

2:38:55.420 --> 2:38:56.420
 You know you're not going to tell me?

2:38:56.420 --> 2:39:00.940
 This is very...

2:39:00.940 --> 2:39:03.420
 I'm going to have to wait for your next book.

2:39:03.420 --> 2:39:07.260
 The meaning of life.

2:39:07.260 --> 2:39:12.700
 We do the best we can to get through the day.

2:39:12.700 --> 2:39:16.140
 And then there's just a finite number of the days.

2:39:16.140 --> 2:39:17.820
 Are you afraid of the finiteness of it?

2:39:17.820 --> 2:39:21.140
 I think about it more and more as I get older.

2:39:21.140 --> 2:39:23.940
 Yeah, I do.

2:39:23.940 --> 2:39:30.900
 And it's one of these human things, that it is finite, we all know it.

2:39:30.900 --> 2:39:35.980
 Most of us deny it and don't want to think about it.

2:39:35.980 --> 2:39:42.460
 Sometimes you think about it in terms of estate planning, you try to do the rational thing.

2:39:42.460 --> 2:39:46.900
 Sometimes it makes you work harder because you know your time is more and more limited

2:39:46.900 --> 2:39:50.740
 and you want to get things done.

2:39:50.740 --> 2:39:53.700
 I don't know where I am on that.

2:39:53.700 --> 2:40:00.860
 It is just one of those things that's always in the back of my mind.

2:40:00.860 --> 2:40:02.540
 And I don't think that's uncommon.

2:40:02.540 --> 2:40:09.420
 Well it's just like G factor and intelligence, it's a hard truth that's there.

2:40:09.420 --> 2:40:15.100
 And sometimes you kind of walk past it and you don't want to look at it, but it's still

2:40:15.100 --> 2:40:16.100
 there.

2:40:16.100 --> 2:40:17.100
 Yeah.

2:40:17.100 --> 2:40:20.180
 Yes, you can't escape it.

2:40:20.180 --> 2:40:28.220
 And the thing about the G factor and intelligence is everybody knows this is true on a personal

2:40:28.220 --> 2:40:31.020
 daily basis.

2:40:31.020 --> 2:40:39.060
 Even if you think back to when you were in school, you know who the smart kids were.

2:40:39.060 --> 2:40:44.820
 When you are on the phone talking to a customer service representative, that in response to

2:40:44.820 --> 2:40:52.860
 your detailed question is reading a script back to you and you get furious at this.

2:40:52.860 --> 2:40:56.920
 Have you ever called this person a moron or wanted to call this person a moron?

2:40:56.920 --> 2:40:58.820
 You're not listening to me.

2:40:58.820 --> 2:41:03.380
 Everybody has had the experience of dealing with people who they think are not at their

2:41:03.380 --> 2:41:05.260
 level.

2:41:05.260 --> 2:41:09.460
 It's just common because that's the way human beings are.

2:41:09.460 --> 2:41:11.140
 That's the way life is.

2:41:11.140 --> 2:41:16.380
 But we also have a poor estimation of our own intelligence.

2:41:16.380 --> 2:41:22.980
 We have a poor, and we're not always a great, our judgment of human character of other people

2:41:22.980 --> 2:41:29.100
 is not as good as a battery of tests.

2:41:29.100 --> 2:41:31.780
 That's where bias comes in.

2:41:31.780 --> 2:41:35.660
 That's where our history, our emotions, all of that comes in.

2:41:35.660 --> 2:41:39.860
 So, you know, people on the internet, you know, there's such a thing as the internet

2:41:39.860 --> 2:41:45.940
 and people on the internet will call each other dumb all the time.

2:41:45.940 --> 2:41:53.060
 You know, that's the worry here is that we give up on people.

2:41:53.060 --> 2:42:00.140
 We put them in a bin just because of one interaction or some small number of interactions as if

2:42:00.140 --> 2:42:01.140
 that's it.

2:42:01.140 --> 2:42:02.140
 They're hopeless.

2:42:02.140 --> 2:42:03.640
 That's just in their genetics.

2:42:03.640 --> 2:42:11.140
 But I think no matter what the science here says, once again, that does not mean we should

2:42:11.140 --> 2:42:15.020
 not have compassion for our fellow man.

2:42:15.020 --> 2:42:17.700
 That's exactly what the science does say.

2:42:17.700 --> 2:42:22.540
 It's not opposite of what the science says.

2:42:22.540 --> 2:42:30.120
 Everything I know about psychology, everything I've learned about intelligence, everything

2:42:30.120 --> 2:42:38.220
 points to the inexorable conclusion that you have to treat people as individuals respectfully

2:42:38.220 --> 2:42:40.060
 and with compassion.

2:42:40.060 --> 2:42:46.780
 Because through no fault of their own, some people are not as capable as others.

2:42:46.780 --> 2:42:52.220
 And you want to turn a blind eye to it, you want to come up with theories about why that

2:42:52.220 --> 2:42:54.300
 might be true, fine.

2:42:54.300 --> 2:42:58.060
 I would like to fix some of it as best I can.

2:42:58.060 --> 2:43:01.860
 And everybody is deserving of love.

2:43:01.860 --> 2:43:05.340
 Richard, this is a good way to end it, I think.

2:43:05.340 --> 2:43:07.500
 I'm just getting warmed up here.

2:43:07.500 --> 2:43:08.500
 I know.

2:43:08.500 --> 2:43:15.220
 I know you can go for another many hours, but to respect your extremely valuable time,

2:43:15.220 --> 2:43:16.780
 this is an amazing conversation.

2:43:16.780 --> 2:43:23.900
 Thank you for the teaching company, the lectures you've given with the New York Science of

2:43:23.900 --> 2:43:24.900
 Intelligence.

2:43:24.900 --> 2:43:29.700
 Thank you for everything you're doing, it's a difficult topic, it's a topic that's controversial

2:43:29.700 --> 2:43:35.820
 and sensitive to people and to push forward boldly and in that nuanced way, just thank

2:43:35.820 --> 2:43:37.060
 you for everything you do.

2:43:37.060 --> 2:43:42.260
 And thank you for asking the big questions of intelligence, of consciousness.

2:43:42.260 --> 2:43:43.500
 Well thank you for asking me.

2:43:43.500 --> 2:43:47.660
 I mean, there's nothing like good conversation on these topics.

2:43:47.660 --> 2:43:50.100
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Haier.

2:43:50.100 --> 2:43:54.540
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:43:54.540 --> 2:43:57.620
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein.

2:43:57.620 --> 2:44:04.460
 It is not that I'm so smart, but I stay with the questions much longer.

2:44:04.460 --> 2:44:25.580
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
