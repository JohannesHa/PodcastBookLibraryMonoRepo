00:00.000 --> 00:04.320
 The following is a conversation with Daniel Schmachtenberger, a founding member of the

00:04.320 --> 00:09.480
 Consilience Project that is aimed at improving public sensemaking and dialogue.

00:09.480 --> 00:15.320
 He is interested in understanding how we humans can be the best version of ourselves as individuals

00:15.320 --> 00:19.000
 and as collectives at all scales.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.920
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Ground News, NetSuite, Four Sigmatic, Magic Spoon, and

00:24.920 --> 00:25.920
 BetterHelp.

00:25.920 --> 00:29.560
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:29.560 --> 00:33.760
 As a side note, let me say that I got a chance to talk to Daniel on and off the mic for a

00:33.760 --> 00:34.760
 couple of days.

00:34.760 --> 00:37.920
 We took a long walk the day before our conversation.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.800
 I really enjoyed meeting him, just on a basic human level.

00:40.800 --> 00:46.600
 We talked about the world around us with words that carried hope for us individual ants actually

00:46.600 --> 00:50.120
 contributing something of value to the colony.

00:50.120 --> 00:55.040
 These conversations are the reasons I love human beings, our insatiable striving to lessen

00:55.040 --> 00:56.780
 the suffering in the world.

00:56.780 --> 01:01.680
 But more than that, there's a simple magic to two strangers meeting for the first time

01:01.680 --> 01:06.180
 and sharing ideas, becoming fast friends, and creating something that is far greater

01:06.180 --> 01:07.880
 than the sum of our parts.

01:07.880 --> 01:12.400
 I've gotten to experience some of that same magic here in Austin with a few new friends

01:12.400 --> 01:16.240
 and in random bars in my travels across this country.

01:16.240 --> 01:21.000
 Where a conversation leaves me with a big stupid smile on my face and a new appreciation

01:21.000 --> 01:24.420
 of this too short, too beautiful life.

01:24.420 --> 01:31.220
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Daniel Schmachtenberger.

01:31.220 --> 01:37.520
 If aliens were observing Earth through the entire history, just watching us, and we're

01:37.520 --> 01:41.320
 tasked with summarizing what happened until now, what do you think they would say?

01:41.320 --> 01:43.480
 What do you think they would write up in that summary?

01:43.480 --> 01:47.080
 Like it has to be pretty short, less than a page.

01:47.080 --> 01:54.120
 Like in Hitchhiker's Guide, there's I think like a paragraph or a couple sentences.

01:54.120 --> 01:58.560
 How would you summarize, sorry, how would the aliens summarize, do you think, all of

01:58.560 --> 02:00.920
 human civilization?

02:00.920 --> 02:04.520
 My first thoughts take more than a page.

02:04.520 --> 02:06.840
 They'd probably distill it.

02:06.840 --> 02:12.420
 Because if they watched, well, I mean, first, I have no idea if their senses are even attuned

02:12.420 --> 02:16.960
 to similar stuff to what our senses are attuned to, or what the nature of their consciousness

02:16.960 --> 02:19.000
 is like relative to ours.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.480
 So let's assume that they're kind of like us, just technologically more advanced to

02:22.480 --> 02:24.040
 get here from wherever they are.

02:24.040 --> 02:27.400
 That's the first kind of constraint on the thought experiment.

02:27.400 --> 02:32.760
 And then if they've watched throughout all of history, they saw the burning of Alexandria.

02:32.760 --> 02:38.960
 They saw that 2,000 years ago in Greece, we were producing things like clocks, the antikytheria

02:38.960 --> 02:40.880
 mechanism, and then that technology got lost.

02:40.880 --> 02:45.000
 They saw that there wasn't just a steady dialectic of progress.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.280
 So every once in a while, there's a giant fire that destroys a lot of things.

02:49.280 --> 02:54.280
 There's a giant commotion that destroys a lot of things.

02:54.280 --> 02:58.520
 Yeah, and it's usually self induced.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.840
 They would have seen that.

03:00.840 --> 03:07.400
 And so as they're looking at us now, as we move past the nuclear weapons age into the

03:07.400 --> 03:15.100
 full globalization, anthropocene, exponential tech age, still making our decisions relatively

03:15.100 --> 03:21.200
 similarly to how we did in the stone age as far as rivalry game theory type stuff, I think

03:21.200 --> 03:24.840
 they would think that this is probably most likely one of the planets that is not going

03:24.840 --> 03:28.040
 to make it to being intergalactic because we blow ourselves up in the technological

03:28.040 --> 03:29.600
 adolescence.

03:29.600 --> 03:37.220
 And if we are going to, we're going to need some major progress rapidly in the social

03:37.220 --> 03:43.660
 technologies that can guide and bind and direct the physical technologies so that we are safe

03:43.660 --> 03:46.200
 vessels for the amount of power we're getting.

03:46.200 --> 03:55.920
 Actually, Hitchhiker's Guide has an estimation about how much of a risk this particular thing

03:55.920 --> 03:57.640
 poses to the rest of the galaxy.

03:57.640 --> 04:03.560
 And I think, I forget what it was, I think it was medium or low.

04:03.560 --> 04:08.940
 So their estimation was, would be that this species of ant like creatures is not going

04:08.940 --> 04:10.400
 to survive long.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.960
 There's ups and downs in terms of technological innovation.

04:13.960 --> 04:18.520
 The fundamental nature of their behavior from a game theory perspective hasn't really changed.

04:18.520 --> 04:26.660
 They have not learned in any fundamental way how to control and properly incentivize or

04:26.660 --> 04:32.760
 properly do the mechanism design of games to ensure long term survival.

04:32.760 --> 04:35.720
 And then they move on to another planet.

04:35.720 --> 04:43.440
 Do you think there is, in a slightly more serious question, do you think there's some

04:43.440 --> 04:50.560
 number or perhaps a very, very large number of intelligent alien civilizations out there?

04:50.560 --> 04:54.000
 Yes, would be hard to think otherwise.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.920
 I know, I think Bostrom had a new article not that long ago on why that might not be

04:58.920 --> 05:04.020
 the case, that the Drake equation might not be the kind of end story on it.

05:04.020 --> 05:09.640
 But when I look at the total number of Kepler planets just that we're aware of just galactically

05:09.640 --> 05:16.460
 and also like when those life forms were discovered in Mono Lake that didn't have the same six

05:16.460 --> 05:21.360
 primary atoms, I think it had arsenic replacing phosphorus as one of the primary aspects of

05:21.360 --> 05:26.400
 its energy metabolism, we get to think about that the building blocks might be more different.

05:26.400 --> 05:30.760
 So the physical constraints even that the planets have to have might be more different.

05:30.760 --> 05:37.400
 It seems really unlikely not to mention interesting things that we've observed that are still

05:37.400 --> 05:38.400
 unexplained.

05:38.400 --> 05:44.320
 As you had guests on your show discussing Tic Tac and all the ones that have visited.

05:44.320 --> 05:45.320
 Yeah.

05:45.320 --> 05:46.560
 Well, let's dive right into that.

05:46.560 --> 05:56.480
 What do you make sense of the rich human psychology of there being hundreds of thousands, probably

05:56.480 --> 06:02.880
 millions of witnesses of UFOs of different kinds on Earth, most of which I presume are

06:02.880 --> 06:07.520
 conjured up by the human mind through the perception system.

06:07.520 --> 06:12.760
 Some number might be true, some number might be reflective of actual physical objects,

06:12.760 --> 06:21.080
 whether it's you know, drones or testing military technology that secret or otherworldly technology.

06:21.080 --> 06:26.760
 What do you make sense of all of that, because it's gained quite a bit of popularity recently.

06:26.760 --> 06:37.040
 There's some sense in which that's us humans being hopeful and dreaming of otherworldly

06:37.040 --> 06:44.480
 creatures as a way to escape the dreariness of our of the human condition.

06:44.480 --> 06:49.480
 But in another sense, it could be it really could be something truly exciting that science

06:49.480 --> 06:53.640
 should turn its eye towards.

06:53.640 --> 06:56.320
 So what do you where do you place it?

06:56.320 --> 07:00.960
 Speaking of turning eye towards this is one of those super fascinating, actually super

07:00.960 --> 07:05.720
 consequential possibly topics that I wish I had more time to study and just haven't

07:05.720 --> 07:09.000
 allocated so I don't have firm beliefs on this because I haven't got to study it as

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
 much as I want.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.480
 So what I'm going to say comes from a superficial assessment.

07:15.480 --> 07:20.280
 While we know there are plenty of things that people thought of as UFO sightings that we

07:20.280 --> 07:24.400
 can fully write off, we have other better explanations for them.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.200
 What we're interested in is the ones that we don't have better explanations for and

07:27.200 --> 07:33.080
 then not just immediately jumping to a theory of what it is, but holding it as unidentified

07:33.080 --> 07:36.560
 and being being curious and earnest.

07:36.560 --> 07:42.360
 I think the the tic tac one is quite interesting and made it in major media recently.

07:42.360 --> 07:49.120
 But I don't know if you ever saw the Disclosure Project, a guy named Steven Greer organized

07:49.120 --> 07:57.520
 a bunch of mostly US military and some commercial flight people who had direct observation and

07:57.520 --> 08:02.100
 classified information disclosing it at a CNN briefing.

08:02.100 --> 08:07.480
 And so you saw high ranking generals, admirals, fighter pilots all describing things that

08:07.480 --> 08:17.600
 they saw on radar with their own eyes or cameras, and also describing some phenomena that had

08:17.600 --> 08:20.560
 some consistency across different people.

08:20.560 --> 08:27.320
 And I find this interesting enough that I think it would be silly to just dismiss it.

08:27.320 --> 08:32.000
 And specifically, we can ask the question, how much of it is natural phenomena, ball

08:32.000 --> 08:34.440
 lightning or something like that?

08:34.440 --> 08:39.360
 And this is why I'm more interested in what fighter pilots and astronauts and people who

08:39.360 --> 08:48.960
 are trained in being able to identify flying objects and atmospheric phenomena have to

08:48.960 --> 08:51.560
 say about it.

08:51.560 --> 08:57.240
 I think the thing then you could say, well, are they more advanced military craft?

08:57.240 --> 09:00.120
 Is it some kind of, you know, human craft?

09:00.120 --> 09:03.920
 The interesting thing that a number of them describe is something that's kind of like

09:03.920 --> 09:09.260
 right angles at speed, or not right angles, acute angles at speed, but something that

09:09.260 --> 09:14.600
 looks like a different relationship to inertia than physics makes sense for us.

09:14.600 --> 09:20.880
 I don't think that there are any human technologies that are doing that even in really deep underground

09:20.880 --> 09:22.360
 black projects.

09:22.360 --> 09:25.760
 Now one could say, okay, well, could it be a hologram?

09:25.760 --> 09:28.240
 Or would it show up on radar if radar is also seeing it?

09:28.240 --> 09:30.760
 And so I don't know.

09:30.760 --> 09:37.440
 I think there's enough, I mean, and for that to be a massive coordinated psyop, is it as

09:37.440 --> 09:45.200
 interesting and ridiculous in a way as the idea that it's UFOs from some extra planetary

09:45.200 --> 09:46.200
 source?

09:46.200 --> 09:49.340
 So it's up there on the interesting topics.

09:49.340 --> 09:57.540
 To me there's, if it is at all alien technology, it is the dumbest version of alien technology.

09:57.540 --> 10:03.040
 It's so far away, it's like the old, old crappy VHS tapes of alien technology.

10:03.040 --> 10:08.240
 These are like crappy drones that just floated or even like space to the level of like space

10:08.240 --> 10:14.280
 junk because it is so close to our human technology.

10:14.280 --> 10:19.400
 We talk about it moves in ways that's unlike what we understand about physics, but it still

10:19.400 --> 10:26.960
 has very similar kind of geometric notions and something that we humans can perceive

10:26.960 --> 10:28.480
 with our eyes, all those kinds of things.

10:28.480 --> 10:34.800
 I feel like alien technology most likely would be something that we would not be able to

10:34.800 --> 10:35.800
 perceive.

10:35.800 --> 10:43.200
 Not because they're hiding, but because it's so far advanced that it would be beyond the

10:43.200 --> 10:45.280
 cognitive capabilities of us humans.

10:45.280 --> 10:53.440
 Just as you were saying, as per your answer for alien summarizing Earth, the starting

10:53.440 --> 10:59.200
 assumption is they have similar perception systems, they have similar cognitive capabilities,

10:59.200 --> 11:01.400
 and that very well may not be the case.

11:01.400 --> 11:08.320
 Let me ask you about staying in aliens for just a little longer because I think it's

11:08.320 --> 11:14.440
 a good transition in talking about governments and human societies.

11:14.440 --> 11:24.600
 Do you think if a US government or any government was in possession of an alien spacecraft or

11:24.600 --> 11:34.220
 of information related to alien spacecraft, they would have the capacity, structurally

11:34.220 --> 11:45.040
 would they have the processes, would they be able to communicate that to the public

11:45.040 --> 11:50.840
 effectively or would they keep it secret in a room and do nothing with it, both to try

11:50.840 --> 11:58.400
 to preserve military secrets, but also because of the incompetence that's inherent to bureaucracies

11:58.400 --> 12:00.240
 or either?

12:00.240 --> 12:08.400
 Well, we can certainly see when certain things become declassified 25 or 50 years later that

12:08.400 --> 12:13.000
 there were things that the public might have wanted to know that were kept secret for a

12:13.000 --> 12:20.600
 very long time for reasons of at least supposedly national security, which is also a nice source

12:20.600 --> 12:27.940
 of plausible deniability for people covering their ass for doing things that would be problematic

12:27.940 --> 12:34.260
 and other purposes.

12:34.260 --> 12:42.600
 There are, there's a scientist at Stanford who supposedly got some material that was

12:42.600 --> 12:48.640
 recovered from Area 51 type area, did analysis on it using, I believe, electron microscopy

12:48.640 --> 12:56.520
 and a couple other methods and came to the idea that it was a nanotech alloy that was

12:56.520 --> 13:00.320
 something we didn't currently have the ability to do, was not naturally occurring.

13:00.320 --> 13:05.040
 So there, I've heard some things and again, like I said, I'm not going to stand behind

13:05.040 --> 13:13.140
 any of these because I haven't done the level of study to have high confidence.

13:13.140 --> 13:19.480
 I think what you said also about would it be super low tech alien craft, like would

13:19.480 --> 13:24.240
 they necessarily move their atoms around in space or might they do something more interesting

13:24.240 --> 13:30.160
 than that, might they be able to have a different relationship to the concept of space or information

13:30.160 --> 13:36.880
 or consciousness or one of the things that the craft supposedly do is not only accelerate

13:36.880 --> 13:40.580
 and turn in a way that looks non inertial, but also disappear.

13:40.580 --> 13:45.240
 So there's a question as to like the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive and it

13:45.240 --> 13:51.400
 could be possible to, some people run a hypothesis that they create intentional amounts of exposure

13:51.400 --> 13:58.800
 as an invitation of a particular kind, who knows, interesting field.

13:58.800 --> 14:05.400
 We tend to assume like SETI that's listening out for aliens out there, I've just been

14:05.400 --> 14:13.360
 recently reading more and more about gravitational waves and you have orbiting black holes that

14:13.360 --> 14:20.880
 orbit each other, they generate ripples in space time on my, for fun at night when I

14:20.880 --> 14:25.960
 lay in bed, I think about what it would be like to ride those waves when they, not the

14:25.960 --> 14:30.600
 low magnitude they are when they reach earth, but get closer to the black holes because

14:30.600 --> 14:38.000
 it will basically be shrinking and expanding us in all dimensions, including time.

14:38.000 --> 14:43.040
 So it's actually ripples through space time that they generate.

14:43.040 --> 14:51.960
 Why is it that you couldn't use that, it travels the speed of light, travels at a speed which

14:51.960 --> 15:00.200
 is a very weird thing to say when you're morphing space time, you could argue it's faster than

15:00.200 --> 15:02.200
 the speed of light.

15:02.200 --> 15:08.720
 So if you're able to communicate by, to summon enough energy to generate black holes and

15:08.720 --> 15:16.960
 to orbit them, to force them to orbit each other, why not travel as the ripples in space

15:16.960 --> 15:21.040
 time, whatever the hell that means, somehow combined with wormholes.

15:21.040 --> 15:26.840
 So if you're able to communicate through, like we don't think of gravitational waves

15:26.840 --> 15:33.420
 as something you can communicate with because the radio will have to be a very large size

15:33.420 --> 15:39.360
 and very dense, but perhaps that's it, perhaps that's one way to communicate, it's a very

15:39.360 --> 15:41.040
 effective way.

15:41.040 --> 15:47.640
 And that would explain, like we wouldn't even be able to make sense of that, of the physics

15:47.640 --> 15:53.320
 that results in an alien species that's able to control gravity at that scale.

15:53.320 --> 15:57.880
 I think you just jumped up the Kardashev scale so far that you're not just harnessing the

15:57.880 --> 16:05.840
 power of a star, but harnessing the power of mutually rotating black holes.

16:05.840 --> 16:13.600
 That's way above my physics pay grade to think about including even non rotating black hole

16:13.600 --> 16:17.040
 versions of transwarp travel.

16:17.040 --> 16:22.600
 I think, you know, you can talk with Eric more about that, I think he has better ideas

16:22.600 --> 16:23.920
 on it than I do.

16:23.920 --> 16:30.000
 My hope for the future of humanity mostly does not rest in the near term on our ability

16:30.000 --> 16:33.140
 to get to other habitable planets in time.

16:33.140 --> 16:39.400
 And even more than that, in the list of possible solutions of how to improve human civilization,

16:39.400 --> 16:43.080
 orbiting black holes is not on the first page for you.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.080
 Not on the first page.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.080
 Okay.

16:45.080 --> 16:49.840
 I bet you did not expect us to start this conversation here, but I'm glad the places

16:49.840 --> 16:52.640
 it went.

16:52.640 --> 17:02.600
 I am excited on a much smaller scale of Mars, Europa, Titan, Venus, potentially having very

17:02.600 --> 17:11.560
 like bacteria like life forms, just on a small human level, it's a little bit scary, but

17:11.560 --> 17:19.120
 mostly really exciting that there might be life elsewhere in the volcanoes and the oceans

17:19.120 --> 17:25.240
 all around us, teaming, having little societies and whether there's properties about that

17:25.240 --> 17:28.320
 kind of life that's somehow different than ours.

17:28.320 --> 17:35.320
 I don't know what would be more exciting if those colonies of single cell type organisms,

17:35.320 --> 17:39.360
 what would be more exciting if they're different or they're the same?

17:39.360 --> 17:47.080
 If they're the same, that means through the rest of the universe, there's life forms like

17:47.080 --> 17:51.320
 us, something like us everywhere.

17:51.320 --> 17:57.160
 If they're different, that's also really exciting because there's life forms everywhere that

17:57.160 --> 18:00.440
 are not like us.

18:00.440 --> 18:01.440
 That's a little bit scary.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.640
 I don't know what's scarier actually.

18:04.640 --> 18:08.600
 I think both scary and exciting no matter what, right?

18:08.600 --> 18:11.560
 The idea that they could be very different is philosophically very interesting for us

18:11.560 --> 18:17.640
 to open our aperture on what life and consciousness and self replicating possibilities could look

18:17.640 --> 18:19.760
 like.

18:19.760 --> 18:22.560
 The question on are they different or the same, obviously there's lots of life here

18:22.560 --> 18:26.840
 that is the same in some ways and different in other ways.

18:26.840 --> 18:30.520
 When you take the thing that we call an invasive species is something that's still pretty the

18:30.520 --> 18:36.360
 same hydrocarbon based thing, but co evolved with co selective pressures in a certain environment,

18:36.360 --> 18:39.720
 we move it to another environment, it might be devastating to that whole ecosystem because

18:39.720 --> 18:44.960
 it's just different enough that it messes up the self stabilizing dynamics of that ecosystem.

18:44.960 --> 18:52.600
 So the question of are they, would they be different in ways where we could still figure

18:52.600 --> 18:59.280
 out a way to inhabit a biosphere together or fundamentally not fundamentally the nature

18:59.280 --> 19:04.240
 of how they operate and the nature of how we operate would be incommensurable is a deep

19:04.240 --> 19:05.240
 question.

19:05.240 --> 19:10.000
 Well, we offline talked about mimetic theory, right?

19:10.000 --> 19:15.600
 It seems like if there were sufficiently different where we would not even, we can coexist on

19:15.600 --> 19:19.620
 different planes, it seems like a good thing.

19:19.620 --> 19:24.400
 If we're close enough together to where we'd be competing, then it's, you're getting into

19:24.400 --> 19:30.040
 the world of viruses and pathogens and all those kinds of things to where we would, one

19:30.040 --> 19:40.160
 of us would die off quickly through basically mass murder without even accidentally.

19:40.160 --> 19:48.560
 If we just had a self replicating single celled kind of creature that happened to not work

19:48.560 --> 19:53.720
 well for the hydrocarbon life that was here that got introduced because he either output

19:53.720 --> 19:57.520
 something that was toxic or utilized up the same resource too quickly and it just replicated

19:57.520 --> 20:04.440
 faster and mutated faster, that it wouldn't be a mimetic theory, conflict theory kind

20:04.440 --> 20:05.440
 of harm.

20:05.440 --> 20:11.200
 It would just be a Von Neumann machine, a self replicating machine that was fundamentally

20:11.200 --> 20:16.280
 incompatible with these kinds of self replicating systems with faster OODA loops.

20:16.280 --> 20:24.280
 For one final time, putting your alien God hat on and you look at human civilization,

20:24.280 --> 20:30.840
 do you think about the 7.8 billion people on earth as individual little creatures, individual

20:30.840 --> 20:41.760
 little organisms, or do you think of us as one organism with a collective intelligence?

20:41.760 --> 20:46.600
 What's the proper framework through which to analyze it again as an alien?

20:46.600 --> 20:50.640
 So that I know where you're coming from, would you have asked the question the same way before

20:50.640 --> 20:54.080
 the industrial revolution, before the agricultural revolution when there were half a billion

20:54.080 --> 20:59.220
 people and no telecommunications connecting them?

20:59.220 --> 21:09.000
 I would indeed ask the question the same way, but I would be less confident about your conclusions.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.840
 It would be an actually more interesting way to ask the question at that time, but I was

21:12.840 --> 21:14.520
 nevertheless asked it the same way.

21:14.520 --> 21:15.520
 Yes.

21:15.520 --> 21:20.480
 Well, let's go back further and smaller than rather than just a single human or the entire

21:20.480 --> 21:27.480
 human species, let's look at a relatively isolated tribe.

21:27.480 --> 21:34.600
 In the relatively isolated, probably sub Dunbar number, sub 150 people tribe, do I look at

21:34.600 --> 21:40.400
 that as one entity where evolution is selecting for based on group selection or do I think

21:40.400 --> 21:45.800
 of it as 150 individuals that are interacting in some way?

21:45.800 --> 21:49.840
 Well, could those individuals exist without the group?

21:49.840 --> 21:52.480
 No.

21:52.480 --> 22:00.920
 The evolutionary adaptiveness of humans was involved critically group selection and individual

22:00.920 --> 22:06.760
 humans alone trying to figure out stone tools and protection and whatever aren't what was

22:06.760 --> 22:09.040
 selected for.

22:09.040 --> 22:13.560
 And so I think the or is the wrong frame.

22:13.560 --> 22:20.280
 I think it's individuals are affecting the group that they're a part of.

22:20.280 --> 22:25.280
 They're also dependent upon and being affected by the group that they're part of.

22:25.280 --> 22:31.080
 And so this now starts to get deep into political theories also, which is theories that orient

22:31.080 --> 22:35.280
 towards the collective at different scales, whether a tribal scale or an empire or a nation

22:35.280 --> 22:40.100
 state or something, and ones that orient towards the individual liberalism and stuff like that.

22:40.100 --> 22:43.420
 And I think there's very obvious failure modes on both sides.

22:43.420 --> 22:47.040
 And so the relationship between them is more interesting to me than either of them.

22:47.040 --> 22:49.840
 The relationship between the individual and the collective and the question around how

22:49.840 --> 22:52.080
 to have a virtuous process between those.

22:52.080 --> 22:57.480
 So a good social system would be one where the organism of the individual and the organism

22:57.480 --> 23:02.000
 of the group of individuals is they're both synergistic to each other.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.760
 So what is best for the individuals and what's best for the whole is aligned.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.960
 But there is nevertheless an individual.

23:08.960 --> 23:21.240
 They're not, it's a matter of degrees, I suppose, but what defines a human more, the social

23:21.240 --> 23:26.480
 network within which they've been brought up, through which they've developed their

23:26.480 --> 23:33.040
 intelligence or is it their own sovereign individual self?

23:33.040 --> 23:40.040
 What's your intuition of how much, not just for evolutionary survival, but as intellectual

23:40.040 --> 23:44.040
 beings, how much do we need others for our development?

23:44.040 --> 23:45.040
 Yeah.

23:45.040 --> 23:51.800
 I think we have a weird sense of this today relative to most previous periods of sapient

23:51.800 --> 23:53.280
 history.

23:53.280 --> 23:59.880
 I think the vast majority of sapient history is tribal, like depending upon your early

23:59.880 --> 24:06.760
 human model, 200,000 or 300,000 years of homo sapiens and little tribes, where they depended

24:06.760 --> 24:12.760
 upon that tribe for survival and excommunication from the tribe was fatal.

24:12.760 --> 24:17.320
 I think they, and our whole evolutionary genetic history is in that environment and the amount

24:17.320 --> 24:20.880
 of time we've been out of it is relatively so tiny.

24:20.880 --> 24:27.040
 And then we still depended upon extended families and local communities more and the big kind

24:27.040 --> 24:33.200
 of giant market complex where I can provide something to the market to get money, to be

24:33.200 --> 24:35.960
 able to get other things from the market where it seems like I don't need anyone.

24:35.960 --> 24:42.200
 It's almost like disintermediating our sense of need, even though you're in my ability

24:42.200 --> 24:46.500
 to talk to each other using these mics and the phones that we coordinated on took millions

24:46.500 --> 24:50.080
 of people over six continents to be able to run the supply chains that made all the stuff

24:50.080 --> 24:52.360
 that we depend on, but we don't notice that we depend upon them.

24:52.360 --> 24:56.080
 They all seem fungible.

24:56.080 --> 25:00.320
 If you take a baby, obviously that you didn't even get to a baby without a mom.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.320
 Was it dependent?

25:01.320 --> 25:05.440
 Are we dependent upon each other, right, without two parents at minimum and they depended upon

25:05.440 --> 25:06.440
 other people.

25:06.440 --> 25:11.400
 But if we take that baby and we put it out in the wild, it obviously dies.

25:11.400 --> 25:14.700
 So if we let it grow up for a little while, the minimum amount of time where it starts

25:14.700 --> 25:19.260
 to have some autonomy and then we put it out in the wild, and this has happened a few times,

25:19.260 --> 25:27.760
 it doesn't learn language and it doesn't learn the small motor articulation that we learn.

25:27.760 --> 25:34.420
 It doesn't learn the type of consciousness that we end up having that is socialized.

25:34.420 --> 25:41.260
 So I think we take for granted how much conditioning affects us.

25:41.260 --> 25:49.960
 Is it possible that it affects basically 99.9 or maybe the whole thing?

25:49.960 --> 25:56.280
 The whole thing is the connection between us humans and that we're no better than apes

25:56.280 --> 25:59.080
 without our human connections.

25:59.080 --> 26:05.400
 Because thinking of it that way forces us to think very differently about human society

26:05.400 --> 26:09.800
 and how to progress forward if the connections are fundamental.

26:09.800 --> 26:14.060
 I just have to object to the no better than apes, because better here I think you mean

26:14.060 --> 26:17.480
 a specific thing, which means have capacities that are fundamentally different than.

26:17.480 --> 26:21.920
 I think apes also depend upon troops.

26:21.920 --> 26:29.200
 And I think the idea of humans as better than nature in some kind of ethical sense ends

26:29.200 --> 26:30.360
 up having heaps of problems.

26:30.360 --> 26:31.360
 We'll table that.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.600
 We can come back to it.

26:32.600 --> 26:36.500
 But when we say what is unique about Homo sapien capacity relative to the other animals

26:36.500 --> 26:41.460
 we currently inhabit the biosphere with, and I'm saying it that way because there were

26:41.460 --> 26:47.820
 other early hominids that had some of these capacities, we believe.

26:47.820 --> 26:52.020
 Our tool creation and our language creation and our coordination are all kind of the results

26:52.020 --> 26:56.320
 of a certain type of capacity for abstraction.

26:56.320 --> 26:59.760
 And other animals will use tools, but they don't evolve the tools they use.

26:59.760 --> 27:03.380
 They keep using the same types of tools that they basically can find.

27:03.380 --> 27:08.200
 So a chimp will notice that a rock can cut a vine that it wants to, and it'll even notice

27:08.200 --> 27:10.160
 that a sharper rock will cut it better.

27:10.160 --> 27:12.480
 And experientially it'll use the sharper rock.

27:12.480 --> 27:15.640
 And if you even give it a knife, it'll probably use the knife because it's experiencing the

27:15.640 --> 27:16.640
 effectiveness.

27:16.640 --> 27:22.240
 But it doesn't make stone tools because that requires understanding why one is sharper

27:22.240 --> 27:23.240
 than the other.

27:23.240 --> 27:28.280
 What is the abstract principle called sharpness to then be able to invent a sharper thing?

27:28.280 --> 27:34.060
 That same abstraction makes language and the ability for abstract representation, which

27:34.060 --> 27:38.960
 makes the ability to coordinate in a more advanced set of ways.

27:38.960 --> 27:43.360
 So I do think our ability to coordinate with each other is pretty fundamental to the selection

27:43.360 --> 27:46.520
 of what we are as a species.

27:46.520 --> 27:51.120
 I wonder if that coordination, that connection is actually the thing that gives birth to

27:51.120 --> 27:56.080
 consciousness, that gives birth to, well, let's start with self awareness.

27:56.080 --> 27:57.080
 More like theory of mind.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.080
 Theory of mind.

27:58.080 --> 27:59.080
 Yeah.

27:59.080 --> 28:03.640
 You know, I suppose there's experiments that show that there's other mammals that have

28:03.640 --> 28:05.640
 a very crude theory of mind.

28:05.640 --> 28:06.640
 Not sure.

28:06.640 --> 28:08.360
 Maybe dogs, something like that.

28:08.360 --> 28:12.520
 But actually dogs probably has to do with that they co evolved with humans.

28:12.520 --> 28:18.920
 See it'd be interesting if that theory of mind is what leads to consciousness in the

28:18.920 --> 28:21.040
 way we think about it.

28:21.040 --> 28:24.880
 Is the richness of the subjective experience that is consciousness.

28:24.880 --> 28:31.440
 I have an inkling sense that that only exists because we're social creatures.

28:31.440 --> 28:36.600
 That doesn't come with the hardware and the software in the beginning.

28:36.600 --> 28:45.120
 That's learned as an effective tool for communication almost.

28:45.120 --> 28:49.200
 I think we think that consciousness is fundamental.

28:49.200 --> 28:58.520
 And maybe it's not, there's a bunch of folks kind of criticize the idea that the illusion

28:58.520 --> 29:00.720
 of consciousness is consciousness.

29:00.720 --> 29:08.440
 That it is just a facade we use to help us construct theories of mind.

29:08.440 --> 29:12.120
 You almost put yourself in the world as a subjective being.

29:12.120 --> 29:18.000
 And that experience, you want to richly experience it as an individual person so that I could

29:18.000 --> 29:20.800
 empathize with your experience.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.760
 I find that notion compelling.

29:22.760 --> 29:29.000
 Mostly because it allows you to then create robots that become conscious not by being

29:29.000 --> 29:37.840
 quote unquote conscious but by just learning to fake it till they make it.

29:37.840 --> 29:44.400
 Present a facade of consciousness with the task of making that facade very convincing

29:44.400 --> 29:48.240
 to us humans and thereby it will become conscious.

29:48.240 --> 29:55.440
 Have a sense that in some way that will make them conscious if they're sufficiently convincing

29:55.440 --> 29:58.880
 to humans.

29:58.880 --> 30:05.260
 Is there some element of that that you find convincing?

30:05.260 --> 30:11.960
 This is a much harder set of questions and deep end of the pool than starting with the

30:11.960 --> 30:15.040
 aliens was.

30:15.040 --> 30:18.060
 We went from aliens to consciousness.

30:18.060 --> 30:24.140
 This is not the trajectory I was expecting nor you, but let us walk a while.

30:24.140 --> 30:27.100
 We can walk a while and I don't think we will do it justice.

30:27.100 --> 30:34.320
 So what do we mean by consciousness versus conscious self reflective awareness?

30:34.320 --> 30:38.200
 What do we mean by awareness, qualia, theory of mind?

30:38.200 --> 30:45.040
 There's a lot of terms that we think of as slightly different things and subjectivity,

30:45.040 --> 30:46.040
 first person.

30:46.040 --> 30:53.200
 I don't remember exactly the quote, but I remember when reading when Sam Harris wrote

30:53.200 --> 30:57.780
 the book Free Will and then Dennett critiqued it and then there was some writing back and

30:57.780 --> 31:05.380
 forth between the two because normally they're on the same side of kind of arguing for critical

31:05.380 --> 31:11.240
 thinking and logical fallacies and philosophy of science against supernatural ideas.

31:11.240 --> 31:15.680
 And here Dennett believed there is something like free will.

31:15.680 --> 31:21.600
 He is a determinist compatibilist, but no consciousness and a radical element of this.

31:21.600 --> 31:24.340
 And Sam was saying, no, there is consciousness, but there's no free will.

31:24.340 --> 31:29.040
 And that's like the most fundamental kinds of axiomatic senses they disagreed on, but

31:29.040 --> 31:31.240
 neither of them could say it was because the other one didn't understand the philosophy

31:31.240 --> 31:34.220
 of science or logical fallacies.

31:34.220 --> 31:37.160
 And they kind of spoke past each other and at the end, if I remember correctly, Sam said

31:37.160 --> 31:42.360
 something that I thought was quite insightful, which was to the effect of it seems, because

31:42.360 --> 31:46.120
 they weren't making any progress in shared understanding, it seems that we simply have

31:46.120 --> 31:49.100
 different intuitions about this.

31:49.100 --> 31:56.240
 And what you could see was that what the words meant, right at the level of symbol grounding,

31:56.240 --> 31:59.360
 might be quite different.

31:59.360 --> 32:03.480
 One of them might have had deeply different enough life experiences that what is being

32:03.480 --> 32:06.700
 referenced and then also different associations of what the words mean.

32:06.700 --> 32:11.760
 This is why when trying to address these things, Charles Sanders Peirce said the first philosophy

32:11.760 --> 32:16.600
 has to be semiotics, because if you don't get semiotics right, we end up importing different

32:16.600 --> 32:20.320
 ideas and bad ideas right into the nature of the language that we're using.

32:20.320 --> 32:22.920
 And then it's very hard to do epistemology or ontology together.

32:22.920 --> 32:28.280
 So, I'm saying this to say why I don't think we're going to get very far is I think we

32:28.280 --> 32:33.960
 would have to go very slowly in terms of defining what we mean by words and fundamental concepts.

32:33.960 --> 32:40.960
 Well, and also allowing our minds to drift together for a time so that our definitions

32:40.960 --> 32:42.800
 of these terms align.

32:42.800 --> 32:51.360
 I think there's some, there's a beauty that some people enjoy with Sam that he is quite

32:51.360 --> 32:59.600
 stubborn on his definitions of terms without often clearly revealing that definition.

32:59.600 --> 33:06.440
 So in his mind, he can sense that he can deeply understand what he means exactly by a term

33:06.440 --> 33:08.200
 like free will and consciousness.

33:08.200 --> 33:15.860
 And you're right, he's very specific in fascinating ways that not only does he think that free

33:15.860 --> 33:23.360
 will is an illusion, he thinks he's able, not thinks, he says he's able to just remove

33:23.360 --> 33:30.000
 himself from the experience of free will and just be like for minutes at a time, hours

33:30.000 --> 33:38.480
 at a time, like really experience as if he has no free will, like he's a leaf flowing

33:38.480 --> 33:41.320
 down the river.

33:41.320 --> 33:45.880
 And given that, he's very sure that consciousness is fundamental.

33:45.880 --> 33:53.280
 So here's this conscious leaf that's subjectively experiencing the floating and yet has no ability

33:53.280 --> 33:56.760
 to control and make any decisions for itself.

33:56.760 --> 34:02.440
 It's only a, the decisions have all been made.

34:02.440 --> 34:06.560
 There's some aspect to which the terminology there perhaps is the problem.

34:06.560 --> 34:11.320
 So that's a particular kind of meditative experience and the people in the Vedantic

34:11.320 --> 34:15.680
 tradition and some of the Buddhist traditions thousands of years ago described similar experiences

34:15.680 --> 34:19.480
 and somewhat similar conclusions, some slightly different.

34:19.480 --> 34:27.240
 There are other types of phenomenal experience that are the phenomenal experience of pure

34:27.240 --> 34:33.720
 agency and, you know, like the Catholic theologian but evolutionary theorist Teilhard de Chardin

34:33.720 --> 34:39.640
 describes this and that rather than a creator agent God in the beginning, there's a creative

34:39.640 --> 34:44.280
 impulse or a creative process and he would go into a type of meditation that identified

34:44.280 --> 34:49.360
 as the pure essence of that kind of creative process.

34:49.360 --> 34:55.560
 And I think the types of experience we've had and then one, the types of experience

34:55.560 --> 34:58.640
 we've had make a big deal to the nature of how we do symbol grounding.

34:58.640 --> 35:03.040
 The other thing is the types of experiences we have can't not be interpreted through

35:03.040 --> 35:07.240
 our existing interpretive frames and most of the time our interpretive frames are unknown

35:07.240 --> 35:09.720
 even to us, some of them.

35:09.720 --> 35:15.480
 And so this is a tricky, this is a tricky topic.

35:15.480 --> 35:19.520
 So I guess there's a bunch of directions we could go with it but I want to come back to

35:19.520 --> 35:24.440
 what the impulse was that was interesting around what is consciousness and how does

35:24.440 --> 35:29.960
 it relate to us as social beings and how does it relate to the possibility of consciousness

35:29.960 --> 35:30.960
 with AIs.

35:30.960 --> 35:35.880
 Right, you're keeping us on track which is, which is wonderful, you're a wonderful hiking

35:35.880 --> 35:36.880
 partner.

35:36.880 --> 35:37.880
 Okay, yes.

35:37.880 --> 35:43.180
 Let's go back to the initial impulse of what is consciousness and how does the social impulse

35:43.180 --> 35:45.940
 connect to consciousness?

35:45.940 --> 35:50.640
 Is consciousness a consequence of that social connection?

35:50.640 --> 35:55.160
 I'm going to state a position and not argue it because it's honestly like it's a long

35:55.160 --> 36:00.980
 hard thing to argue and we can totally do it another time if you want.

36:00.980 --> 36:11.080
 I don't subscribe to consciousness as an emergent property of biology or neural networks.

36:11.080 --> 36:17.880
 Obviously a lot of people do, obviously the philosophy of science orients towards that

36:17.880 --> 36:24.600
 in not absolutely but largely.

36:24.600 --> 36:33.920
 I think of the nature of first person, the universe of first person, of qualia as experience,

36:33.920 --> 36:41.160
 sensation, desire, emotion, phenomenology, but the felt sense, not the we say emotion

36:41.160 --> 36:45.320
 and we think of a neurochemical pattern or an endocrine pattern.

36:45.320 --> 36:50.560
 But all of the physical stuff, the third person stuff has position and momentum and charge

36:50.560 --> 36:55.200
 and stuff like that that is measurable, repeatable.

36:55.200 --> 37:00.880
 I think of the nature of first person and third person as ontologically orthogonal to

37:00.880 --> 37:03.620
 each other, not reducible to each other.

37:03.620 --> 37:06.840
 They're different kinds of stuff.

37:06.840 --> 37:11.160
 So I think about the evolution of third person that we're quite used to thinking about from

37:11.160 --> 37:14.400
 subatomic particles to atoms to molecules to on and on.

37:14.400 --> 37:19.440
 I think about a similar kind of and corresponding evolution in the domain of first person from

37:19.440 --> 37:24.720
 the way Whitehead talked about kind of prehension or proto qualia in earlier phases of self

37:24.720 --> 37:29.240
 organization into higher orders of it and that there's correspondence, but that neither

37:29.240 --> 37:35.960
 like the idealists do we reduce third person to first person, which is what idealists do,

37:35.960 --> 37:40.840
 or neither like the physicalists do we reduce first person to third person.

37:40.840 --> 37:46.440
 Obviously Bohm talked about an implicate order that was deeper than and gave rise to the

37:46.440 --> 37:48.480
 explicate order of both.

37:48.480 --> 37:49.920
 Nagel talks about something like that.

37:49.920 --> 37:54.080
 I have a slightly different sense of that, but again, I'll just kind of not argue how

37:54.080 --> 37:59.240
 that occurs for a moment and say, so rather than say, does consciousness emerge from,

37:59.240 --> 38:07.340
 I'll talk about do higher capacities of consciousness emerge in relationship with.

38:07.340 --> 38:12.320
 So it's not first person as a category emerging from third person, but increased complexity

38:12.320 --> 38:17.160
 within the nature of first person and third person co evolving.

38:17.160 --> 38:22.080
 Do I think that it seems relatively likely that more advanced neural networks have deeper

38:22.080 --> 38:29.920
 phenomenology, more complex, where it goes just from basic sensation to emotion to social

38:29.920 --> 38:35.160
 awareness to abstract cognition to self reflexive abstract cognition?

38:35.160 --> 38:36.160
 Yeah.

38:36.160 --> 38:37.880
 But I wouldn't say that's the emergence of consciousness.

38:37.880 --> 38:41.800
 I would say it's increased complexity within the domain of first person corresponding to

38:41.800 --> 38:46.640
 increased complexity and the correspondence should not automatically be seen as causal.

38:46.640 --> 38:50.000
 We can get into the arguments for why that often is the case.

38:50.000 --> 38:57.080
 So would I say that obviously the sapient brain is pretty unique and a single sapient

38:57.080 --> 38:58.280
 now has that, right?

38:58.280 --> 39:03.760
 Even if it took sapiens evolving in tribes based on group selection to make that brain.

39:03.760 --> 39:06.100
 So the group made it now that brain is there.

39:06.100 --> 39:09.800
 Now if I take that single person with that brain out of the group and try to raise them

39:09.800 --> 39:14.920
 in a box, they'll still not be very interesting even with the brain.

39:14.920 --> 39:20.880
 But the brain does give hardware capacities that if conditioned in relationship can have

39:20.880 --> 39:21.880
 interesting things emerge.

39:21.880 --> 39:29.520
 So do I think that the human biology, types of human consciousness and types of social

39:29.520 --> 39:32.760
 interaction all co emerged and co evolved?

39:32.760 --> 39:33.760
 Yes.

39:33.760 --> 39:38.580
 As a small aside, as you're talking about the biology, let me comment that I spent,

39:38.580 --> 39:41.520
 this is what I do, this is what I do with my life.

39:41.520 --> 39:47.400
 This is why I will never accomplish anything is I spent much of the morning trying to do

39:47.400 --> 39:53.120
 research on how many computations the brain performs and how much energy it uses versus

39:53.120 --> 40:00.080
 the state of the art CPUs and GPUs arriving at about 20 quadrillion.

40:00.080 --> 40:03.560
 So that's two to the 10 to the 16 computations.

40:03.560 --> 40:08.080
 So synaptic firings per second that the brain does.

40:08.080 --> 40:15.840
 And that's about a million times faster than the let's say the 20 thread state of the

40:15.840 --> 40:21.360
 arts Intel CPU, the 10th generation.

40:21.360 --> 40:28.640
 And then there's similar calculation for the GPU and all ended up also trying to compute

40:28.640 --> 40:32.600
 that it takes 10 watts to run the brain about.

40:32.600 --> 40:36.020
 And then what does that mean in terms of calories per day, kilocalories?

40:36.020 --> 40:44.780
 That's about for an average human brain, that's 250 to 300 calories a day.

40:44.780 --> 40:54.800
 And so it ended up being a calculation where you're doing about 20 quadrillion calculations

40:54.800 --> 40:59.280
 that are fueled by something like depending on your diet, three bananas.

40:59.280 --> 41:05.760
 So three bananas results in a computation that's about a million times more powerful

41:05.760 --> 41:08.320
 than the current state of the art computers.

41:08.320 --> 41:10.720
 Now, let's take that one step further.

41:10.720 --> 41:12.480
 There's some assumptions built in there.

41:12.480 --> 41:17.240
 The assumption is that one, what the brain is doing is just computation.

41:17.240 --> 41:21.760
 Two, the relevant computations are synaptic firings and that there's nothing other than

41:21.760 --> 41:25.120
 synaptic firings that we have to factor.

41:25.120 --> 41:28.040
 So I'm forgetting his name right now.

41:28.040 --> 41:35.240
 There's a very famous neuroscientist at Stanford just passed away recently who did a lot of

41:35.240 --> 41:40.320
 the pioneering work on glial cells and showed that his assessment glial cells did a huge

41:40.320 --> 41:42.280
 amount of the thinking, not just neurons.

41:42.280 --> 41:46.440
 And it opened up this entirely different field of like what the brain is and what consciousness

41:46.440 --> 41:47.440
 is.

41:47.440 --> 41:51.960
 You look at Damasio's work on embodied cognition and how much of what we would consider consciousness

41:51.960 --> 41:56.120
 or feeling is happening outside of the nervous system completely, happening in endocrine

41:56.120 --> 42:00.560
 process involving lots of other cells and signal communication.

42:00.560 --> 42:04.540
 You talk to somebody like Penrose who you've had on the show and even though the Penrose

42:04.540 --> 42:08.720
 Hammerhoff conjecture is probably not right, is there something like that that might be

42:08.720 --> 42:11.920
 the case where we're actually having to look at stuff happening at the level of quantum

42:11.920 --> 42:14.820
 computation of microtubules?

42:14.820 --> 42:16.800
 I'm not arguing for any of those.

42:16.800 --> 42:20.800
 I'm arguing that we don't know how big the unknown unknown set is.

42:20.800 --> 42:26.440
 Well, at the very least, this has become like an infomercial for the human brain.

42:26.440 --> 42:29.820
 At the very, but wait, there's more.

42:29.820 --> 42:33.400
 At the very least, the three bananas buys you a million times.

42:33.400 --> 42:34.400
 At the very least.

42:34.400 --> 42:35.400
 At the very least.

42:35.400 --> 42:36.400
 That's impressive.

42:36.400 --> 42:41.280
 And then you could have, and then the synaptic firings we're referring to is strictly the

42:41.280 --> 42:42.280
 electrical signals.

42:42.280 --> 42:45.880
 That could be the mechanical transmission of information, there's chemical transmission

42:45.880 --> 42:49.520
 of information, there's all kinds of other stuff going on.

42:49.520 --> 42:52.600
 And then there's memory that's built in, that's also all tied in.

42:52.600 --> 42:58.760
 Not to mention, which I'm learning more and more about, it's not just about the neurons.

42:58.760 --> 43:02.320
 It's also about the immune system that's somehow helping with the computation.

43:02.320 --> 43:06.960
 So the entirety and the entire body is helping with the computation.

43:06.960 --> 43:07.960
 So the three bananas.

43:07.960 --> 43:10.080
 It could buy you a lot.

43:10.080 --> 43:12.320
 It could buy you a lot.

43:12.320 --> 43:22.360
 But on the topic of sort of the greater degrees of complexity emerging in consciousness, I

43:22.360 --> 43:29.120
 think few things are as beautiful and inspiring as taking a step outside of the human brain,

43:29.120 --> 43:36.460
 just looking at systems where simple rules create incredible complexity.

43:36.460 --> 43:38.300
 Not create.

43:38.300 --> 43:40.180
 Incredible complexity emerges.

43:40.180 --> 43:46.540
 So one of the simplest things to do that with is cellular automata.

43:46.540 --> 43:53.960
 And there's, I don't know what it is, and maybe you can speak to it, we will certainly

43:53.960 --> 44:02.360
 talk about the implications of this, but there's so few things that are as awe inspiring to

44:02.360 --> 44:07.960
 me as knowing the rules of a system and not being able to predict what the heck it looks

44:07.960 --> 44:08.960
 like.

44:08.960 --> 44:15.280
 And it creates incredibly beautiful complexity that when zoomed out on, looks like there's

44:15.280 --> 44:26.000
 actual organisms doing things that operate on a scale much higher than the underlying

44:26.000 --> 44:27.920
 mechanism.

44:27.920 --> 44:31.440
 So with cellular automata, that's cells that are born and die.

44:31.440 --> 44:34.560
 Born and die and they only know about each other's neighbors.

44:34.560 --> 44:38.120
 And there's simple rules that govern that interaction of birth and death.

44:38.120 --> 44:44.760
 And then they create, at scale, organisms that look like they take up hundreds or thousands

44:44.760 --> 44:49.160
 of cells and they're moving, they're moving around, they're communicating, they're sending

44:49.160 --> 44:51.000
 signals to each other.

44:51.000 --> 44:59.040
 And you forget at moments at a time before you remember that the simple rules on cells

44:59.040 --> 45:04.120
 is all that it took to create that.

45:04.120 --> 45:15.480
 It's sad in that we can't come up with a simple description of that system that generalizes

45:15.480 --> 45:19.040
 the behavior of the large organisms.

45:19.040 --> 45:23.320
 We can only come up, we can only hope to come up with the thing, the fundamental physics

45:23.320 --> 45:25.600
 or the fundamental rules of that system, I suppose.

45:25.600 --> 45:29.880
 It's sad that we can't predict everything we know about the mathematics of those systems.

45:29.880 --> 45:34.760
 It seems like we can't really in a nice way, like economics tries to do, to predict how

45:34.760 --> 45:37.160
 this whole thing will unroll.

45:37.160 --> 45:42.600
 But it's beautiful because of how simple it is underneath it all.

45:42.600 --> 45:49.040
 So what do you make of the emergence of complexity from simple rules?

45:49.040 --> 45:50.360
 What the hell is that about?

45:50.360 --> 45:51.360
 Yeah.

45:51.360 --> 45:56.800
 Well, we can see that something like flocking behavior, the murmuration, can be computer

45:56.800 --> 45:57.800
 coded.

45:57.800 --> 46:01.680
 It's a very hard set of rules to be able to see some of those really amazing types of

46:01.680 --> 46:03.600
 complexity.

46:03.600 --> 46:08.320
 And the whole field of complexity science and some of the subdisciplines like Stigma

46:08.320 --> 46:14.980
 G are studying how following fairly simple responses to a pheromone signal do ant colonies

46:14.980 --> 46:19.240
 do this amazing thing where what you might describe as the organizational or computational

46:19.240 --> 46:26.040
 capacity of the colony is so profound relative to what each individual ant is doing.

46:26.040 --> 46:31.320
 I am not anywhere near as well versed in the cutting edge of cellular automata as I would

46:31.320 --> 46:32.320
 like.

46:32.320 --> 46:36.800
 Unfortunately, in terms of topics that I would like to get to and haven't, like ET's more

46:36.800 --> 46:43.340
 Wolfram's A New Kind of Science, I have only skimmed and read reviews of and not read the

46:43.340 --> 46:47.020
 whole thing or his newer work since.

46:47.020 --> 46:53.280
 But his idea of the four basic kind of categories of emergent phenomena that can come from cellular

46:53.280 --> 46:59.300
 automata and that one of them is kind of interesting and looks a lot like complexity rather than

46:59.300 --> 47:08.520
 just chaos or homogeneity or self termination or whatever.

47:08.520 --> 47:11.900
 I think this is very interesting.

47:11.900 --> 47:17.760
 It does not instantly make me think that biology is operating on a similarly small set of rules

47:17.760 --> 47:19.800
 and or that human consciousness is.

47:19.800 --> 47:26.400
 I'm not that reductionist oriented.

47:26.400 --> 47:31.200
 So if you look at, say, Santa Fe Institute, one of the cofounders, Stuart Kaufman, his

47:31.200 --> 47:33.220
 work, you should really get him on your show.

47:33.220 --> 47:39.060
 So a lot of the questions that you like, one of Kaufman's more recent books after investigations

47:39.060 --> 47:42.180
 and some of the real fundamental stuff was called Reinventing the Sacred and it had to

47:42.180 --> 47:47.080
 do with some of these exact questions in kind of non reductionist approach, but that is

47:47.080 --> 47:50.520
 not just silly hippie ism.

47:50.520 --> 47:55.680
 And he was very interested in highly non ergodic systems where you couldn't take a lot of behavior

47:55.680 --> 47:59.200
 over a small period of time and predict what the behavior of subsets over a longer period

47:59.200 --> 48:01.960
 of time would do.

48:01.960 --> 48:05.460
 And then going further, someone who spent some time at Santa Fe Institute and then kind

48:05.460 --> 48:10.840
 of made a whole new field that you should have on, Dave Snowden, who some people call

48:10.840 --> 48:16.300
 the father of anthro complexity or what is the complexity unique to humans.

48:16.300 --> 48:19.960
 And he says something to the effect of that modeling humans as termites really doesn't

48:19.960 --> 48:20.960
 cut it.

48:20.960 --> 48:26.740
 Like we don't respond exactly identically to the same pheromone stimulus using Stigma

48:26.740 --> 48:30.840
 G like it works for flows of traffic and some very simple human behaviors, but it really

48:30.840 --> 48:35.440
 doesn't work for trying to make sense of the Sistine Chapel and Picasso and general relativity

48:35.440 --> 48:37.880
 creation and stuff like that.

48:37.880 --> 48:43.280
 And it's because the termites are not doing abstraction, forecasting deep into the future

48:43.280 --> 48:47.240
 and making choices now based on forecasts of the future, not just adaptive signals in

48:47.240 --> 48:49.780
 the moment and evolutionary code from history.

48:49.780 --> 48:51.120
 That's really different, right?

48:51.120 --> 48:56.260
 Like making choices now that can factor deep modeling of the future.

48:56.260 --> 49:02.160
 And with humans, our uniqueness one to the next in terms of response to similar stimuli

49:02.160 --> 49:06.100
 is much higher than it is with a termite.

49:06.100 --> 49:08.960
 One of the interesting things there is that their uniqueness is extremely low.

49:08.960 --> 49:11.040
 They're basically fungible within a class, right?

49:11.040 --> 49:14.400
 There's different classes, but within a class they're basically fungible and their system

49:14.400 --> 49:19.680
 uses that very high numbers and lots of loss, right?

49:19.680 --> 49:20.680
 Lots of death and loss.

49:20.680 --> 49:21.680
 But do you think the termite feels that way?

49:21.680 --> 49:25.320
 Don't, don't you think we humans are deceiving ourselves about our uniqueness?

49:25.320 --> 49:29.440
 Perhaps it doesn't, it just, isn't there some sense in which this emergence just creates

49:29.440 --> 49:34.360
 different higher and higher levels of abstraction where every, at every layer, each organism

49:34.360 --> 49:35.880
 feels unique?

49:35.880 --> 49:36.880
 Is that possible?

49:36.880 --> 49:40.240
 That we're all equally dumb but at different scales?

49:40.240 --> 49:44.280
 No, I think uniqueness is evolving.

49:44.280 --> 49:51.160
 I think that hydrogen atoms are more similar to each other than cells of the same type

49:51.160 --> 49:52.160
 are.

49:52.160 --> 49:54.240
 And I think that cells are more similar to each other than humans are.

49:54.240 --> 50:00.800
 And I think that highly K selected species are more unique than R selected species.

50:00.800 --> 50:03.080
 So they're different evolutionary processes.

50:03.080 --> 50:09.600
 The R selected species where you have a whole, a lot of death and very high birth rates,

50:09.600 --> 50:16.080
 and not looking for as much individuality within or individual possible expression to

50:16.080 --> 50:18.760
 cover the evolutionary search space within an individual.

50:18.760 --> 50:22.840
 You're looking at it more in terms of a numbers game.

50:22.840 --> 50:26.960
 So yeah, I would say there's probably more difference between one orca and the next than

50:26.960 --> 50:29.880
 there is between one Cape buffalo and the next.

50:29.880 --> 50:35.400
 Given that, it would be interesting to get your thoughts about memetic theory where we're

50:35.400 --> 50:43.360
 imitating each other in the context of this idea of uniqueness.

50:43.360 --> 50:46.180
 How much truth is there to that?

50:46.180 --> 50:56.000
 How compelling is this worldview to you of Girardian memetic theory of desire where maybe

50:56.000 --> 51:00.040
 you can explain it from your perspective, but it seems like imitating each other is

51:00.040 --> 51:05.920
 the fundamental property of the behavior of human civilization.

51:05.920 --> 51:09.400
 Well, imitation is not unique to humans, right?

51:09.400 --> 51:11.800
 Monkeys imitate.

51:11.800 --> 51:18.000
 So a certain amount of learning through observing is not unique to humans.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.640
 Humans do more of it.

51:19.640 --> 51:24.360
 It's actually kind of worth speaking to this for a moment.

51:24.360 --> 51:27.020
 Monkeys can learn new behaviors, new...

51:27.020 --> 51:31.620
 We've even seen teaching an ape sign language and then the ape teaching other apes sign

51:31.620 --> 51:33.180
 language.

51:33.180 --> 51:34.840
 So that's a kind of mimesis, right?

51:34.840 --> 51:38.200
 Kind of learning through imitation.

51:38.200 --> 51:42.880
 And that needs to happen if they need to learn or develop capacities that are not just coded

51:42.880 --> 51:44.420
 by their genetics, right?

51:44.420 --> 51:49.120
 So within the same genome, they're learning new things based on the environment.

51:49.120 --> 51:54.640
 And so based on someone else learn something first and so let's pick it up.

51:54.640 --> 51:59.140
 How much a creature is the result of just its genetic programming and how much it's

51:59.140 --> 52:02.300
 learning is a very interesting question.

52:02.300 --> 52:06.080
 And I think this is a place where humans really show up radically different than everything

52:06.080 --> 52:07.360
 else.

52:07.360 --> 52:13.760
 And you can see it in the neoteny, how long we're basically fetal.

52:13.760 --> 52:19.920
 That the closest ancestors to us, if we look at a chimp, a chimp can hold on to its mother's

52:19.920 --> 52:22.820
 fur while she moves around day one.

52:22.820 --> 52:26.640
 And obviously we see horses up and walking within 20 minutes.

52:26.640 --> 52:30.560
 The fact that it takes a human a year to be walking and it takes a horse 20 minutes and

52:30.560 --> 52:34.320
 you say how many multiples of 20 minutes go into a year, like that's a long period of

52:34.320 --> 52:37.360
 helplessness that wouldn't work for a horse, right?

52:37.360 --> 52:40.320
 Like they or anything else.

52:40.320 --> 52:46.000
 And not only could we not hold on to mom in the first day, it's three months before we

52:46.000 --> 52:48.600
 can move our head volitionally.

52:48.600 --> 52:52.440
 So it's like why are we embryonic for so long?

52:52.440 --> 52:58.880
 Obviously it's like it's still fetal on the outside, had to be because couldn't keep growing

52:58.880 --> 53:05.600
 inside and actually ever get out with big heads and narrower hips from going upright.

53:05.600 --> 53:11.360
 So here's a place where there's a coevolution of the pattern of humans, specifically here

53:11.360 --> 53:18.080
 our neoteny and what that portends to learning with our being tool making and environment

53:18.080 --> 53:24.160
 modifying creatures, which is because we have the abstraction to make tools, we change our

53:24.160 --> 53:26.760
 environments more than other creatures change their environments.

53:26.760 --> 53:31.760
 The next most environment modifying creature to us is like a beaver.

53:31.760 --> 53:36.780
 And then we're in LA, you fly into LAX and you look at the just orthogonal grid going

53:36.780 --> 53:39.320
 on forever in all directions.

53:39.320 --> 53:43.320
 And we've recently come into the Anthropocene where the surface of the earth is changing

53:43.320 --> 53:47.880
 more from human activity than geological activity and then beavers and you're like, okay, wow,

53:47.880 --> 53:53.800
 we're really in a class of our own in terms of environment modifying.

53:53.800 --> 54:01.680
 So as soon as we started tool making, we were able to change our environments much more

54:01.680 --> 54:02.680
 radically.

54:02.680 --> 54:05.360
 We could put on clothes and go to a cold place.

54:05.360 --> 54:10.480
 And this is really important because we actually went and became apex predators in every environment.

54:10.480 --> 54:15.920
 We functioned like apex predators, polar bear can't leave the Arctic and the lion can't

54:15.920 --> 54:18.160
 leave the Savannah and an orca can't leave the ocean.

54:18.160 --> 54:21.360
 And we went and became apex predators in all those environments because of our tool creation

54:21.360 --> 54:22.360
 capacity.

54:22.360 --> 54:25.240
 We could become better predators than them adapted to the environment or at least with

54:25.240 --> 54:27.320
 our tools adapted to the environment.

54:27.320 --> 54:34.360
 So in every aspect towards any organism in any environment, we're incredibly good at

54:34.360 --> 54:36.120
 becoming apex predators.

54:36.120 --> 54:37.120
 Yes.

54:37.120 --> 54:40.080
 And nothing else can do that kind of thing.

54:40.080 --> 54:44.880
 There is no other apex predator that, you see the other apex predator is only getting

54:44.880 --> 54:48.840
 better at being a predator through evolutionary process that's super slow and that super slow

54:48.840 --> 54:52.180
 process creates co selective process with their environment.

54:52.180 --> 54:56.480
 So as the predator becomes a tiny bit faster, it eats more of the slow prey, the genes of

54:56.480 --> 54:58.960
 the fast prey and breed and the prey becomes faster.

54:58.960 --> 55:03.800
 And so there's this kind of balancing and we in because of our tool making, we increased

55:03.800 --> 55:08.580
 our predatory capacity faster than anything else could increase its resilience to it.

55:08.580 --> 55:13.920
 As a result, we start outstripping the environment and extincting species following stone tools

55:13.920 --> 55:15.640
 and going and becoming apex predator everywhere.

55:15.640 --> 55:18.800
 This is why we can't keep applying apex predator theories because we're not an apex predator.

55:18.800 --> 55:22.540
 We're an apex predator, but we're something much more than that.

55:22.540 --> 55:27.240
 Like just for an example, the top apex predator in the world, an orca.

55:27.240 --> 55:31.680
 An orca can eat one big fish at a time, like one tuna, and it'll miss most of the time

55:31.680 --> 55:33.760
 or one seal.

55:33.760 --> 55:39.040
 And we can put a mile long drift net out on a single boat and pull up an entire school

55:39.040 --> 55:40.040
 of them.

55:40.040 --> 55:41.040
 Right?

55:41.040 --> 55:42.040
 We can deplete the entire oceans of them.

55:42.040 --> 55:43.040
 That's not an orca.

55:43.040 --> 55:45.760
 That's not an apex predator.

55:45.760 --> 55:49.640
 And that's not even including that we can then genetically engineer different creatures.

55:49.640 --> 55:50.760
 We can extinct species.

55:50.760 --> 55:52.840
 We can devastate whole ecosystems.

55:52.840 --> 55:56.260
 We can make built worlds that have no natural things that are just human built worlds.

55:56.260 --> 55:59.240
 We can build new types of natural creatures, synthetic life.

55:59.240 --> 56:02.800
 So we are much more like little gods than we are like apex predators now, but we're

56:02.800 --> 56:06.320
 still behaving as apex predators and little gods that behave as apex predators causes

56:06.320 --> 56:10.780
 a problem kind of core to my assessment of the world.

56:10.780 --> 56:13.080
 So what does it mean to be a predator?

56:13.080 --> 56:19.680
 So a predator is somebody that effectively can mine the resources from a place.

56:19.680 --> 56:28.440
 So for their survival, or is it also just purely like higher level objectives of violence

56:28.440 --> 56:34.840
 and what is, can predators be predators towards the same, each other towards the same species?

56:34.840 --> 56:39.960
 Like are we using the word predator sort of generally, which then connects to conflict

56:39.960 --> 56:46.080
 and military conflict, violent conflict in this base of human species.

56:46.080 --> 56:50.000
 Obviously we can say that plants are mining the resources of their environment in a particular

56:50.000 --> 56:54.680
 way, using photosynthesis to be able to pull minerals out of the soil and nitrogen and

56:54.680 --> 56:57.600
 carbon out of the air and like that.

56:57.600 --> 57:01.400
 And we can say herbivores are being able to mine and concentrate that.

57:01.400 --> 57:04.600
 So I wouldn't say mining the environment is unique to predator.

57:04.600 --> 57:16.760
 Predator is generally being defined as mining other animals, right?

57:16.760 --> 57:23.600
 We don't consider herbivores predators, but animal, which requires some type of violence

57:23.600 --> 57:27.040
 capacity because animals move, plants don't move.

57:27.040 --> 57:34.200
 So it requires some capacity to overtake something that can move and try to get away.

57:34.200 --> 57:37.640
 We'll go back to the Gerard thing and then we'll come back here.

57:37.640 --> 57:38.640
 Why are we neotenous?

57:38.640 --> 57:42.040
 Why are we embryonic for so long?

57:42.040 --> 57:47.020
 Because are we, did we just move from the Savannah to the Arctic and we need to learn

57:47.020 --> 57:48.200
 new stuff?

57:48.200 --> 57:51.640
 If we came genetically programmed, we would not be able to do that.

57:51.640 --> 57:56.380
 Are we throwing spears or are we fishing or are we running an industrial supply chain

57:56.380 --> 57:57.380
 or are we texting?

57:57.380 --> 57:59.780
 What is the adaptive behavior?

57:59.780 --> 58:03.880
 Horses today in the wild and horses 10,000 years ago are doing pretty much the same stuff.

58:03.880 --> 58:10.280
 And so since we make tools and we evolve our tools and then change our environment so quickly

58:10.280 --> 58:14.520
 and other animals are largely the result of their environment, but we're environment modifying

58:14.520 --> 58:19.240
 so rapidly, we need to come without too much programming so we can learn the environment

58:19.240 --> 58:21.700
 we're in, learn the language, right?

58:21.700 --> 58:27.360
 Which is going to be very important to learn the tool making.

58:27.360 --> 58:32.600
 And so we have a very long period of relative helplessness because we aren't coded how to

58:32.600 --> 58:36.680
 behave yet because we're imprinting a lot of software on how to behave that is useful

58:36.680 --> 58:38.740
 to that particular time.

58:38.740 --> 58:44.680
 So our mimesis is not unique to humans, but the total amount of it is really unique.

58:44.680 --> 58:46.960
 And this is also where the uniqueness can go up, right?

58:46.960 --> 58:51.760
 Is because we are less just the result of the genetics and that means the kind of learning

58:51.760 --> 58:56.680
 through history that they got coded in genetics and more the result of, it's almost like our

58:56.680 --> 59:00.120
 hardware selected for software, right?

59:00.120 --> 59:04.520
 Like if evolution is kind of doing these, think of as a hardware selection, I have problems

59:04.520 --> 59:12.540
 with computer metaphors for biology, but I'll use this one here, that we have not had hardware

59:12.540 --> 59:18.340
 changes since the beginning of sapiens, but our world is really, really different.

59:18.340 --> 59:20.800
 And that's all changes in software, right?

59:20.800 --> 59:27.280
 Changes on the same fundamental genetic substrate, what we're doing with these brains and minds

59:27.280 --> 59:30.740
 and bodies and social groups and like that.

59:30.740 --> 59:40.680
 And so, now, Gerard specifically was looking at when we watch other people talking, so

59:40.680 --> 59:44.000
 we learn language, you and I would have a hard time learning Mandarin today or it would

59:44.000 --> 59:47.220
 take a lot of work, we'd be learning how to conjugate verbs and stuff, but a baby learns

59:47.220 --> 59:50.320
 it instantly without anyone even really trying to teach it just through mimesis.

59:50.320 --> 59:52.520
 So it's a powerful thing.

59:52.520 --> 59:55.400
 They're obviously more neuroplastic than we are when they're doing that and all their

59:55.400 --> 59:57.200
 attention is allocated to that.

59:57.200 --> 1:00:01.480
 But they're also learning how to move their bodies and they're learning all kinds of stuff

1:00:01.480 --> 1:00:02.560
 through mimesis.

1:00:02.560 --> 1:00:06.760
 One of the things that Gerard says is they're also learning what to want.

1:00:06.760 --> 1:00:07.880
 And they learn what to want.

1:00:07.880 --> 1:00:10.580
 They learn desire by watching what other people want.

1:00:10.580 --> 1:00:16.440
 And so, intrinsic to this, people end up wanting what other people want and if we can't have

1:00:16.440 --> 1:00:21.760
 what other people have without taking it away from them, then that becomes a source of conflict.

1:00:21.760 --> 1:00:29.420
 So the mimesis of desire is the fundamental generator of conflict and that then the conflict

1:00:29.420 --> 1:00:32.920
 energy within a group of people will build over time.

1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:35.560
 This is a very, very crude interpretation of the theory.

1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:37.800
 Can we just pause on that?

1:00:37.800 --> 1:00:42.920
 For people who are not familiar and for me who hasn't, I'm loosely familiar but haven't

1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:46.600
 internalized it, but every time I think about it, it's a very compelling view of the world.

1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:53.400
 Whether it's true or not, it's quite, it's like when you take everything Freud says as

1:00:53.400 --> 1:00:59.520
 truth, it's a very interesting way to think about the world and in the same way, thinking

1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:11.320
 about the mimetic theory of desire that everything we want is imitation of other people's wants.

1:01:11.320 --> 1:01:13.360
 We don't have any original wants.

1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:15.840
 We're constantly imitating others.

1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:21.400
 And so, and not just others, but others we're exposed to.

1:01:21.400 --> 1:01:27.600
 So there's these little local pockets, however defined local, of people imitating each other.

1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:33.880
 And one that's super empowering because then you can pick which group you can join.

1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:37.000
 What do you want to imitate?

1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:42.640
 It's the old like, whoever your friends are, that's what your life is going to be like.

1:01:42.640 --> 1:01:43.640
 That's really powerful.

1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:50.400
 I mean, it's depressing that we're so unoriginal, but it's also liberating in that if this holds

1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:55.680
 true, that we can choose our life by choosing the people we hang out with.

1:01:55.680 --> 1:01:57.120
 So okay.

1:01:57.120 --> 1:02:01.020
 Thoughts that are very compelling that seem like they're more absolute than they actually

1:02:01.020 --> 1:02:02.840
 are end up also being dangerous.

1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:10.380
 We want to, I'm going to discuss here where I think we need to amend this particular theory.

1:02:10.380 --> 1:02:14.460
 But specifically, you just said something that everyone who's paid attention knows is

1:02:14.460 --> 1:02:19.080
 true experientially, which is who you're around affects who you become.

1:02:19.080 --> 1:02:26.520
 And as libertarian and self determining and sovereign as we'd like to be, everybody I

1:02:26.520 --> 1:02:31.640
 think knows that if you got put in the maximum security prison, aspects of your personality

1:02:31.640 --> 1:02:34.560
 would have to adapt or you wouldn't survive there, right?

1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:37.020
 You would become different.

1:02:37.020 --> 1:02:40.720
 If you grew up in Darfur versus Finland, you would be different with your same genetics,

1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:44.440
 like just there's no real question about that.

1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:50.320
 And that even today, if you hang out in a place with ultra marathoners as your roommates

1:02:50.320 --> 1:02:55.360
 or all people who are obese as your roommates, the statistical likelihood of what happens

1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:57.040
 to your fitness is pretty clear, right?

1:02:57.040 --> 1:02:59.440
 Like the behavioral science of this is pretty clear.

1:02:59.440 --> 1:03:04.280
 So the whole saying we are the average of the five people we spend the most time around.

1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:07.800
 I think the more self reflective someone is and the more time they spend by themselves

1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:10.800
 in self reflection, the less this is true, but it's still true.

1:03:10.800 --> 1:03:16.680
 So one of the best things someone can do to become more self determined is be self determined

1:03:16.680 --> 1:03:20.320
 about the environments they want to put themselves in, because to the degree that there is some

1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:24.800
 self determination and some determination by the environment, don't be fighting an environment

1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:27.140
 that is predisposing you in bad directions.

1:03:27.140 --> 1:03:30.960
 Try to put yourself in an environment that is predisposing the things that you want.

1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:34.200
 In turn, try to affect the environment in ways that predispose positive things for those

1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:36.240
 around you.

1:03:36.240 --> 1:03:39.440
 Or perhaps also there's probably interesting ways to play with this.

1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:45.840
 You could probably put yourself like form connections that have this perfect tension

1:03:45.840 --> 1:03:50.040
 in all directions to where you're actually free to decide whatever the heck you want,

1:03:50.040 --> 1:03:56.820
 because the set of wants within your circle of interactions is so conflicting that you're

1:03:56.820 --> 1:03:59.240
 free to choose whichever one.

1:03:59.240 --> 1:04:03.360
 If there's enough tension, as opposed to everybody aligned like a flock of birds.

1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:09.920
 Yeah, I mean, you definitely want that all of the dialectics would be balanced.

1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:17.240
 So if you have someone who is extremely oriented to self empowerment and someone who's extremely

1:04:17.240 --> 1:04:21.320
 oriented to kind of empathy and compassion, both the dialectic of those is better than

1:04:21.320 --> 1:04:24.000
 either of them on their own.

1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:28.480
 If you have both of them inhabiting, being inhabited better than you by the same person

1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:32.640
 and spending time around that person will probably do well for you.

1:04:32.640 --> 1:04:36.920
 I think the thing you just mentioned is super important when it comes to cognitive schools,

1:04:36.920 --> 1:04:43.880
 which is I think one of the fastest things people can do to improve their learning and

1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:50.880
 their not just cognitive learning, but their meaningful problem solving communication and

1:04:50.880 --> 1:04:54.860
 civic capacity, capacity to participate as a citizen with other people and making the

1:04:54.860 --> 1:05:01.080
 world better is to be seeking dialectical synthesis all the time.

1:05:01.080 --> 1:05:06.280
 And so in the Hegelian sense, if you have a thesis, you have an antithesis.

1:05:06.280 --> 1:05:10.240
 So maybe we have libertarianism on one side and Marxist kind of communism on the other

1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:11.240
 side.

1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:16.760
 And one is arguing that the individual is the unit of choice.

1:05:16.760 --> 1:05:21.920
 And so we want to increase the freedom and support of individual choice because as they

1:05:21.920 --> 1:05:25.280
 make more agentic choices, it'll produce a better whole for everybody.

1:05:25.280 --> 1:05:28.080
 The other side saying, well, the individuals are conditioned by their environment who would

1:05:28.080 --> 1:05:31.880
 choose to be born into Darfur rather than Finland.

1:05:31.880 --> 1:05:39.000
 So we actually need to collectively make environments that are good because the environment conditions

1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:40.000
 the individuals.

1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:42.400
 So you have a thesis and an antithesis.

1:05:42.400 --> 1:05:46.040
 And then Hegel's ideas, you have a synthesis, which is a kind of higher order truth that

1:05:46.040 --> 1:05:50.200
 understands how those relate in a way that neither of them do.

1:05:50.200 --> 1:05:52.760
 And so it is actually at a higher order of complexity.

1:05:52.760 --> 1:05:55.540
 So the first part would be, can I steel man each of these?

1:05:55.540 --> 1:05:58.860
 Can I argue each one well enough that the proponents of it are like, totally, you got

1:05:58.860 --> 1:06:00.040
 that?

1:06:00.040 --> 1:06:04.680
 And not just argue it rhetorically, but can I inhabit it where I can try to see and feel

1:06:04.680 --> 1:06:08.540
 the world the way someone seeing and feeling the world that way would?

1:06:08.540 --> 1:06:12.520
 Because once I do, then I don't want to screw those people because there's truth in it,

1:06:12.520 --> 1:06:13.520
 right?

1:06:13.520 --> 1:06:14.520
 And I'm not going to go back to war with them.

1:06:14.520 --> 1:06:18.400
 I'm going to go to finding solutions that could actually work at a higher order.

1:06:18.400 --> 1:06:21.760
 If I don't go to a higher order, then there's war.

1:06:21.760 --> 1:06:25.680
 And but then the higher order thing would be, well, it seems like the individual does

1:06:25.680 --> 1:06:28.800
 affect the commons and the collective and other people.

1:06:28.800 --> 1:06:33.120
 It also seems like the collective conditions individuals at least statistically.

1:06:33.120 --> 1:06:37.480
 And I can cherry pick out the one guy who got out of the ghetto and pulled himself up

1:06:37.480 --> 1:06:38.480
 by his bootstraps.

1:06:38.480 --> 1:06:42.120
 But I can also say statistically that most people born into the ghetto show up differently

1:06:42.120 --> 1:06:44.520
 than most people born into the Hamptons.

1:06:44.520 --> 1:06:49.480
 And so unless you want to argue that and have you take your child from the Hamptons and

1:06:49.480 --> 1:06:52.980
 put them in the ghetto, then like, come on, be realistic about this thing.

1:06:52.980 --> 1:07:00.240
 So how do we make, we don't want social systems that make weak dependent individuals, right?

1:07:00.240 --> 1:07:01.240
 The welfare argument.

1:07:01.240 --> 1:07:08.080
 But we also don't want no social system that supports individuals to do better.

1:07:08.080 --> 1:07:12.300
 We don't want individuals where their self expression and agency fucks the environment

1:07:12.300 --> 1:07:15.680
 and everybody else and employs slave labor and whatever.

1:07:15.680 --> 1:07:21.560
 So can we make it to where individuals are creating holes that are better for conditioning

1:07:21.560 --> 1:07:22.560
 other individuals?

1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:26.560
 Can we make it to where we have holes that are conditioning increased agency and sovereignty,

1:07:26.560 --> 1:07:27.560
 right?

1:07:27.560 --> 1:07:28.560
 That would be the synthesis.

1:07:28.560 --> 1:07:33.280
 So the thing that I'm coming to here is if people have that as a frame, and sometimes

1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:37.600
 it's not just thesis and antithesis, it's like eight different views, right?

1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:39.520
 Can I steel man each view?

1:07:39.520 --> 1:07:42.240
 This is not just, can I take the perspective, but am I seeking them?

1:07:42.240 --> 1:07:46.600
 Am I actively trying to inhabit other people's perspective?

1:07:46.600 --> 1:07:52.060
 Then can I really try to essentialize it and argue the best points of it, both the sense

1:07:52.060 --> 1:07:57.280
 making about reality and the values, why these values actually matter?

1:07:57.280 --> 1:08:04.020
 Then just like I want to seek those perspectives, then I want to seek, is there a higher order

1:08:04.020 --> 1:08:08.560
 set of understandings that could fulfill the values of and synthesize the sense making

1:08:08.560 --> 1:08:10.360
 of all of them simultaneously?

1:08:10.360 --> 1:08:13.140
 Maybe I won't get it, but I want to be seeking it and I want to be seeking progressively

1:08:13.140 --> 1:08:14.540
 better ones.

1:08:14.540 --> 1:08:21.960
 So this is perspective seeking, driving perspective taking, and then seeking synthesis.

1:08:21.960 --> 1:08:31.680
 I think that that one cognitive disposition might be the most helpful thing.

1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:36.040
 Would you put a title of dialectic synthesis on that process because that seems to be such

1:08:36.040 --> 1:08:42.680
 a part, so like this rigorous empathy, like it's not just empathy.

1:08:42.680 --> 1:08:48.240
 It's empathy with rigor, like you really want to understand and embody different worldviews

1:08:48.240 --> 1:08:50.840
 and then try to find a higher order synthesis.

1:08:50.840 --> 1:08:58.080
 Okay, so I remember last night you told me when we first met, you said that you looked

1:08:58.080 --> 1:09:01.800
 in somebody's eyes and you felt that you had suffered in some ways that they had suffered

1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:03.880
 and so you could trust them.

1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:08.000
 Empathy pathos, right, creates a certain sense of kind of shared bonding and shared intimacy.

1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:14.000
 So empathy is actually feeling the suffering of somebody else and feeling the depth of

1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:15.000
 their sentience.

1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:16.000
 I don't want to fuck them anymore.

1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.000
 I don't want to hurt them.

1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:22.480
 I don't want to behave, I don't want my proposition to go through when I go and inhabit the perspective

1:09:22.480 --> 1:09:25.980
 of the other people if they feel that's really going to mess them up, right?

1:09:25.980 --> 1:09:30.320
 And so the rigorous empathy, it's different than just compassion, which is I generally

1:09:30.320 --> 1:09:31.320
 care.

1:09:31.320 --> 1:09:34.280
 I have a generalized care, but I don't know what it's like to be them.

1:09:34.280 --> 1:09:37.500
 I can never know what it's like to be them perfectly and that there's a humility you

1:09:37.500 --> 1:09:42.480
 have to have, which is my most rigorous attempt is still not it.

1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:46.720
 My most rigorous attempt, mine, to know what it's like to be a woman is still not it.

1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:49.520
 I have no question that if I was actually a woman, it would be different than my best

1:09:49.520 --> 1:09:50.520
 guesses.

1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:54.560
 I have no question if I was actually black, it would be different than my best guesses.

1:09:54.560 --> 1:09:57.880
 So there's a humility in that which keeps me listening because I don't think that I

1:09:57.880 --> 1:10:02.440
 know fully, but I want to, and I'm going to keep trying better to.

1:10:02.440 --> 1:10:05.560
 And then I want to accross them, and then I want to say, is there a way we can forward

1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:07.920
 together and not have to be in war?

1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:12.400
 It has to be something that could meet the values that everyone holds, that could reconcile

1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:17.000
 the partial sensemaking that everyone holds, and that could offer a way forward that is

1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:21.280
 more agreeable than the partial perspectives at war with each other.

1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:26.600
 But so the more you succeed at this empathy with humility, the more you're carrying the

1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:30.000
 burden of other people's pain, essentially.

1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:38.720
 Now, this goes back to the question of do I see us as one being or 7.8 billion.

1:10:38.720 --> 1:10:47.120
 I think if I'm overwhelmed with my own pain, I can't empathize that much because I don't

1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:48.120
 have the bandwidth.

1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:49.680
 I don't have the capacity.

1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:53.080
 If I don't feel like I can do something about a particular problem in the world, it's hard

1:10:53.080 --> 1:10:56.040
 to feel it because it's just too devastating.

1:10:56.040 --> 1:11:00.280
 And so a lot of people go numb and even go nihilistic because they just don't feel the

1:11:00.280 --> 1:11:01.280
 agency.

1:11:01.280 --> 1:11:05.680
 So as I actually become more empowered as an individual and have more sense of agency,

1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:10.560
 I also become more empowered to be more empathetic for others and be more connected to that shared

1:11:10.560 --> 1:11:15.720
 burden and want to be able to make choices on behalf of and in benefit of.

1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:23.620
 So this way of living seems like a way of living that would solve a lot of problems

1:11:23.620 --> 1:11:28.540
 in society from a cellular automata perspective.

1:11:28.540 --> 1:11:34.380
 So if you have a bunch of little agents behaving in this way, my intuition, there'll be interesting

1:11:34.380 --> 1:11:39.740
 complexities that emerge, but my intuition is it will create a society that's very different

1:11:39.740 --> 1:11:44.760
 and recognizably better than the one we have today.

1:11:44.760 --> 1:11:45.760
 How much like...

1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:49.960
 Oh, wait, hold that question because I want to come back to it, but this brings us back

1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:51.620
 to Gerard, which we didn't answer.

1:11:51.620 --> 1:11:52.620
 The conflict theory.

1:11:52.620 --> 1:11:53.620
 Yes.

1:11:53.620 --> 1:11:54.840
 Because about how to get past the conflict theory.

1:11:54.840 --> 1:11:55.840
 Yes.

1:11:55.840 --> 1:11:59.040
 You know the Robert Frost poem about the two paths and you never have enough time to return

1:11:59.040 --> 1:12:00.040
 back to the other?

1:12:00.040 --> 1:12:01.400
 We're going to have to do that quite a lot.

1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:08.320
 We're going to be living that poem over and over again, but yes, how to...

1:12:08.320 --> 1:12:09.320
 Let's return back.

1:12:09.320 --> 1:12:10.320
 Okay.

1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:14.500
 So the rest of the argument goes, you learn to want what other people want, therefore

1:12:14.500 --> 1:12:19.200
 fundamental conflict based in our desire because we want the thing that somebody else has.

1:12:19.200 --> 1:12:24.960
 And then people are in conflict over trying to get the same stuff, power, status, attention,

1:12:24.960 --> 1:12:27.780
 physical stuff, a mate, whatever it is.

1:12:27.780 --> 1:12:30.680
 And then we learn the conflict by watching.

1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:33.280
 And so then the conflict becomes metic.

1:12:33.280 --> 1:12:37.840
 And we become on the Palestinian side or the Israeli side or the communist or capitalist

1:12:37.840 --> 1:12:41.460
 side or the left or right politically or whatever it is.

1:12:41.460 --> 1:12:46.720
 And until eventually the conflict energy in the system builds up so much that some type

1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:50.920
 of violence is needed to get the bad guy, whoever it is that we're going to blame.

1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:55.180
 And you know, Gerard talks about why scapegoating was kind of a mechanism to minimize the amount

1:12:55.180 --> 1:12:56.180
 of violence.

1:12:56.180 --> 1:13:00.460
 Let's blame a scapegoat as being more relevant than they really were.

1:13:00.460 --> 1:13:03.600
 But if we all believe it, then we can all kind of calm down with the conflict energy.

1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:06.240
 It's a really interesting concept, by the way.

1:13:06.240 --> 1:13:11.200
 I mean, you beautifully summarized it, but the idea that there's a scapegoat, that there's

1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:15.900
 this kind of thing naturally leads to a conflict and then they find the other, some group that's

1:13:15.900 --> 1:13:20.360
 the other that's either real or artificial as the cause of the conflict.

1:13:20.360 --> 1:13:25.040
 Well, it's always artificial because the cause of the conflict in Gerard is the mimesis of

1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:26.040
 desire itself.

1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:27.640
 And how do we attack that?

1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:30.240
 How do we attack that it's our own desire?

1:13:30.240 --> 1:13:33.880
 So this now gets to something more like Buddha said, right, which was desire is the cause

1:13:33.880 --> 1:13:34.880
 of suffering.

1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:40.160
 Gerard and Buddha would kind of agree in this way.

1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:46.720
 So but that's that explains I mean, again, it's a compelling description of human history

1:13:46.720 --> 1:13:50.040
 that we do tend to come up with the other.

1:13:50.040 --> 1:13:51.040
 And

1:13:51.040 --> 1:13:55.440
 okay, kind of I just I just had such a funny experience with someone critiquing Gerard

1:13:55.440 --> 1:13:59.760
 the other day in such an elegant and beautiful and simple way.

1:13:59.760 --> 1:14:12.760
 It's a friend who's grew up Aboriginal Australian, is a scholar of Aboriginal social technologies.

1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:16.960
 He's like, nah man, Gerard just made shit up about how tribes work.

1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:21.080
 Like we come from a tribe, we've got tens of thousands of years, and we didn't have

1:14:21.080 --> 1:14:23.880
 increasing conflict and then scapegoat and kill someone.

1:14:23.880 --> 1:14:28.040
 We'd have a little bit of conflict and then we would dance and then everybody'd be fine.

1:14:28.040 --> 1:14:31.120
 We'd dance around the campfire, everyone would like kind of physically get the energy out,

1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:34.800
 we'd look in each other's eyes, we'd have positive bonding, and then we're fine.

1:14:34.800 --> 1:14:36.540
 And nobody, no scapegoats.

1:14:36.540 --> 1:14:37.540
 And

1:14:37.540 --> 1:14:42.680
 I think that's called the Joe Rogan theory of desire, which is, he's like, all all of

1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:47.000
 human problems have to do with the fact that you don't do enough hard shit in your day.

1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:51.720
 So maybe, maybe just dance it because he says like doing exercise and running on the treadmill

1:14:51.720 --> 1:14:55.320
 gets gets all the demons out and maybe just dancing gets all the demons out.

1:14:55.320 --> 1:15:00.440
 So this is why I say we have to be careful with taking an idea that seems too explanatory

1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:06.080
 and then taking it as a given and then saying, well, now that we're stuck with the fact that

1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:09.900
 conflict is inexorable because human, because mimetic desire and therefore, how do we deal

1:15:09.900 --> 1:15:12.920
 with the inexorability of the conflict and how to sublimate violence?

1:15:12.920 --> 1:15:17.080
 Well, no, the whole thing might be actually gibberish, meaning it's only true in certain

1:15:17.080 --> 1:15:19.200
 conditions and other conditions it's not true.

1:15:19.200 --> 1:15:22.340
 So the deeper question is under which conditions is that true?

1:15:22.340 --> 1:15:23.960
 Under which conditions is it not true?

1:15:23.960 --> 1:15:26.000
 What do those other conditions make possible and look like?

1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:31.360
 And in general, we should stay away from really compelling models of reality because there's

1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:36.040
 something about, about our brains that these models become sticky and we can't even think

1:15:36.040 --> 1:15:37.040
 outside of them.

1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:38.040
 So.

1:15:38.040 --> 1:15:39.040
 It's not that we stay away from them.

1:15:39.040 --> 1:15:42.540
 It's that we know that the model of reality is never reality.

1:15:42.540 --> 1:15:43.540
 That's the key thing.

1:15:43.540 --> 1:15:47.280
 Humility again, it goes back to just having the humility that you don't have a perfect

1:15:47.280 --> 1:15:48.480
 model of reality.

1:15:48.480 --> 1:15:52.060
 There's an ep, the, the model of reality could never be reality.

1:15:52.060 --> 1:16:00.000
 The process of modeling is inherently information reduction and I can never show that the unknown

1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:02.480
 unknown set has been factored.

1:16:02.480 --> 1:16:05.720
 It's back to the cellular automata.

1:16:05.720 --> 1:16:10.240
 You can't, you can't put the genie back in the bottle.

1:16:10.240 --> 1:16:19.300
 Like when you realize it's unfortunately, sadly impossible to, to create a model of

1:16:19.300 --> 1:16:26.440
 cellular automata, even if you know the basic rules that predict to even any degree of accuracy,

1:16:26.440 --> 1:16:32.200
 what how that system will evolve, which is fascinating mathematically.

1:16:32.200 --> 1:16:33.200
 Sorry.

1:16:33.200 --> 1:16:34.400
 I think about it quite a lot.

1:16:34.400 --> 1:16:36.400
 It's very annoying.

1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:41.980
 Wolfram has this rule 30, like you should be able to predict it.

1:16:41.980 --> 1:16:48.040
 It's so simple, but you can't predict what's going to be like, there's a, there's a problem

1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:53.240
 he defines, like try to predict some aspect of the middle, middle column of the system,

1:16:53.240 --> 1:16:54.760
 just anything about it.

1:16:54.760 --> 1:16:55.760
 What's going to happen in the future.

1:16:55.760 --> 1:17:03.960
 And you can't, you can't, it sucks because then we can't make sense of this world in

1:17:03.960 --> 1:17:07.680
 a real, in a reality, in a definitive way.

1:17:07.680 --> 1:17:11.920
 It's always like in the striving, like it, we're always striving.

1:17:11.920 --> 1:17:12.920
 Yeah.

1:17:12.920 --> 1:17:15.480
 I don't think this sucks.

1:17:15.480 --> 1:17:17.880
 That so that's a feature, not a bug.

1:17:17.880 --> 1:17:21.520
 Well, that's assuming a designer.

1:17:21.520 --> 1:17:23.240
 I would say I don't think it sucks.

1:17:23.240 --> 1:17:27.800
 I think it's not only beautiful, but maybe necessary for beauty.

1:17:27.800 --> 1:17:30.000
 The mess.

1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:35.360
 So you're a, so you're, you're disagree Jordan Pearson should clean up your room.

1:17:35.360 --> 1:17:36.720
 You like the rooms messy.

1:17:36.720 --> 1:17:39.560
 It's a, it's essential for the, for beauty.

1:17:39.560 --> 1:17:42.640
 It's not, it's not that it's okay.

1:17:42.640 --> 1:17:46.080
 I take, I have no idea if it was intended this way.

1:17:46.080 --> 1:17:52.560
 And so I'm just interpreting it a way I like the commandment about having no false idols

1:17:52.560 --> 1:17:58.600
 to me, the way I interpret that that is meaningful is that re reality is sacred to me.

1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:04.920
 I have a reverence for reality, but I know my best understanding of it is never complete.

1:18:04.920 --> 1:18:11.900
 I know my best model of it is a model where I tried to make some kind of predictive capacity

1:18:11.900 --> 1:18:16.600
 by reducing the complexity of it to a set of stuff that I could observe and then a subset

1:18:16.600 --> 1:18:20.680
 of that stuff that I thought was the causal dynamics and then some set of, you know, mechanisms

1:18:20.680 --> 1:18:22.100
 that are involved.

1:18:22.100 --> 1:18:27.960
 And what we find is that it can be super useful, like Newtonian gravity can help us do ballistic

1:18:27.960 --> 1:18:30.080
 curves and all kinds of super useful stuff.

1:18:30.080 --> 1:18:34.520
 And then we get to the place where it doesn't explain what's happening at the cosmological

1:18:34.520 --> 1:18:36.920
 scale or at a quantum scale.

1:18:36.920 --> 1:18:42.120
 And at each time, what we're finding is we excluded stuff.

1:18:42.120 --> 1:18:46.120
 And it also doesn't explain the reconciliation of gravity with quantum mechanics and the

1:18:46.120 --> 1:18:48.400
 other kind of fundamental laws.

1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:53.000
 So models can be useful, but they're never true with a capital T, meaning they're never

1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:59.640
 an actual real full, they're never a complete description of what's happening in real systems.

1:18:59.640 --> 1:19:02.800
 They can be a complete description of what's happening in an artificial system that was

1:19:02.800 --> 1:19:04.700
 the result of applying a model.

1:19:04.700 --> 1:19:07.960
 So the model of a circuit board and the circuit board are the same thing, but I would argue

1:19:07.960 --> 1:19:11.760
 that the model of a cell and the cell are not the same thing.

1:19:11.760 --> 1:19:16.640
 And I would say this is key to what we call complexity versus the complicated, which is

1:19:16.640 --> 1:19:24.040
 a distinction Dave Snowden made well in defining the difference between simple, complicated,

1:19:24.040 --> 1:19:26.060
 complex and chaotic systems.

1:19:26.060 --> 1:19:30.160
 But one of the definers in complex systems is that no matter how you model the complex

1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:34.360
 system, it will still have some emergent behavior not predicted by the model.

1:19:34.360 --> 1:19:37.740
 Can you elaborate on the complex versus the complicated?

1:19:37.740 --> 1:19:41.600
 Complicated means we can fully explicate the phase space of all the things that it can

1:19:41.600 --> 1:19:42.600
 do.

1:19:42.600 --> 1:19:44.200
 We can program it.

1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:49.000
 All human, not all, for the most part, human built things are complicated.

1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:51.180
 They don't self organize.

1:19:51.180 --> 1:19:52.240
 They don't self repair.

1:19:52.240 --> 1:19:57.640
 They're not self evolving and we can make a blueprint for them where, sorry, for human

1:19:57.640 --> 1:20:04.200
 systems, for human technologies, human technologies, that are basically the application of models

1:20:04.200 --> 1:20:06.800
 right.

1:20:06.800 --> 1:20:12.240
 And engineering is kind of applied science, science as the modeling process.

1:20:12.240 --> 1:20:19.920
 And but with humans are complex, complex stuff with biological type stuff and sociological

1:20:19.920 --> 1:20:25.480
 type stuff, it more has generator functions and even those can't be fully explicated than

1:20:25.480 --> 1:20:30.840
 it has or our explanation can't prove that it has closure of what would be in the unknown

1:20:30.840 --> 1:20:33.520
 unknown set where we keep finding like, oh, it's just the genome.

1:20:33.520 --> 1:20:37.100
 Oh, well now it's the genome and the epigenome and then a recursive change on the epigenome

1:20:37.100 --> 1:20:38.100
 because of the proteome.

1:20:38.100 --> 1:20:41.780
 And then there's mitochondrial DNA and then viruses affected and fuck, right?

1:20:41.780 --> 1:20:46.820
 So it's like we get overexcited when we think we found the thing.

1:20:46.820 --> 1:20:49.760
 So on Facebook, you know how you can list your relationship as complicated?

1:20:49.760 --> 1:20:52.160
 It should actually say it's, it's complex.

1:20:52.160 --> 1:20:54.980
 That's the more accurate description.

1:20:54.980 --> 1:21:01.480
 You self terminating is a really interesting idea that you talk about quite a bit.

1:21:01.480 --> 1:21:04.080
 First of all, what is a self terminating system?

1:21:04.080 --> 1:21:11.080
 And I think you have a sense, correct me if I'm wrong, that human civilization is a currently

1:21:11.080 --> 1:21:16.180
 is, is a self terminating system.

1:21:16.180 --> 1:21:20.240
 Why do you have that intuition combined with the definition of what soft self terminating

1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:21.240
 means?

1:21:21.240 --> 1:21:33.400
 Okay, so if we look at human societies historically, human civilizations, it's not that hard to

1:21:33.400 --> 1:21:37.920
 realize that most of the major civilizations and empires of the past don't exist anymore.

1:21:37.920 --> 1:21:40.640
 So they had a life cycle, they died for some reason.

1:21:40.640 --> 1:21:46.320
 So we don't still have the early Egyptian empire or Inca or Maya or Aztec or any of

1:21:46.320 --> 1:21:47.320
 those, right?

1:21:47.320 --> 1:21:52.560
 So they, they terminated, sometimes it seems like they were terminated from the outside

1:21:52.560 --> 1:21:53.560
 in war.

1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:54.560
 Sometimes it seems like they self terminated.

1:21:54.560 --> 1:21:57.720
 When we look at Easter Island, it was a self termination.

1:21:57.720 --> 1:22:00.680
 So let's go ahead and take an island situation.

1:22:00.680 --> 1:22:05.180
 If I have an island and we are consuming the resources on that island faster than the resources

1:22:05.180 --> 1:22:09.760
 can replicate themselves and there's a finite space there, that system is going to self

1:22:09.760 --> 1:22:10.760
 terminate.

1:22:10.760 --> 1:22:13.520
 It's not going to be able to keep doing that thing because you'll get to a place of there's

1:22:13.520 --> 1:22:20.080
 no resources left and then you get a, so now if I'm utilizing the resources faster than

1:22:20.080 --> 1:22:25.320
 they can replicate or faster than they can replenish and I'm actually growing our population

1:22:25.320 --> 1:22:30.400
 in the process, I'm even increasing the rate of the utilization of resources, I might get

1:22:30.400 --> 1:22:35.000
 an exponential curve and then hit a wall and then just collapse the exponential curve rather

1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:39.980
 than do an S curve or some other kind of thing.

1:22:39.980 --> 1:22:47.060
 So self terminating system is any system that depends upon a substrate system that is debasing

1:22:47.060 --> 1:22:50.480
 its own substrate, that is debasing what it depends upon.

1:22:50.480 --> 1:22:58.320
 So you're right that if you look at empires, they rise and fall throughout human history,

1:22:58.320 --> 1:23:02.080
 but not this time, bro.

1:23:02.080 --> 1:23:04.680
 This one's going to last forever.

1:23:04.680 --> 1:23:06.520
 I like that idea.

1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:10.760
 I think that if we don't understand why all the previous ones failed, we can't ensure

1:23:10.760 --> 1:23:11.760
 that.

1:23:11.760 --> 1:23:15.240
 And so I think it's very important to understand it well so that we can have that be a designed

1:23:15.240 --> 1:23:18.760
 outcome with somewhat decent probability.

1:23:18.760 --> 1:23:24.100
 So we're, it's sort of in terms of consuming the resources on the island, we're a clever

1:23:24.100 --> 1:23:33.800
 bunch and we keep coming up, especially when on the horizon there is a termination point,

1:23:33.800 --> 1:23:40.680
 we keep coming up with clever ways of avoiding disaster, of avoiding collapse, of constructing.

1:23:40.680 --> 1:23:44.760
 This is where technological innovation, this is where growth comes in, coming up with different

1:23:44.760 --> 1:23:50.060
 ways to improve productivity and the way society functions such that we consume less resources

1:23:50.060 --> 1:23:53.880
 or get a lot more from the resources we have.

1:23:53.880 --> 1:24:02.080
 So there's some sense in which there's a human ingenuity is a source for optimism about the

1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:07.720
 future of this particular system that may not be self terminating.

1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:13.080
 If there's more innovation than there is consumption.

1:24:13.080 --> 1:24:17.400
 So overconsumption of resources is just one way I think can self terminate.

1:24:17.400 --> 1:24:18.920
 We're just kind of starting here.

1:24:18.920 --> 1:24:27.480
 But there are reasons for optimism and pessimism then they're both worth understanding and

1:24:27.480 --> 1:24:31.960
 there's failure modes on understanding either without the other.

1:24:31.960 --> 1:24:38.320
 As we mentioned previously, there's what I would call naive techno optimism, naive techno

1:24:38.320 --> 1:24:43.520
 capital optimism that says stuff just has been getting better and better and we wouldn't

1:24:43.520 --> 1:24:48.160
 want to live in the dark ages and tech has done all this awesome stuff and we know the

1:24:48.160 --> 1:24:52.240
 proponents of those models and this stuff is going to kind of keep getting better.

1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:55.720
 Of course there are problems, but human ingenuity rises to its supply and demand will solve

1:24:55.720 --> 1:24:56.720
 the problems, whatever.

1:24:56.720 --> 1:25:03.600
 Would you put Rick or as well in that, or in that bucket, is there some specific people

1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:08.600
 you have in mind or naive optimism is truly naive to where you're essentially just have

1:25:08.600 --> 1:25:13.400
 an optimism that's blind to any kind of realities of the way technology progresses.

1:25:13.400 --> 1:25:22.080
 I don't think that anyone who thinks about it and writes about it is perfectly naive.

1:25:22.080 --> 1:25:23.080
 Gotcha.

1:25:23.080 --> 1:25:24.080
 But there might be.

1:25:24.080 --> 1:25:25.720
 It's a platonic ideal.

1:25:25.720 --> 1:25:29.640
 There might be a bias in the nature of the assessment.

1:25:29.640 --> 1:25:40.320
 I would also say there's kind of naive techno pessimism and there are critics of technology.

1:25:40.320 --> 1:25:46.200
 I mean, you read the Unabomber's Manifesto on why technology can't not result in our

1:25:46.200 --> 1:25:51.280
 self termination, so we have to take it out before it gets any further.

1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:58.080
 But also if you read a lot of the X risk community, you know, Bostrom and friends, it's like our

1:25:58.080 --> 1:26:04.160
 total number of existential risks and the total probability of them is going up.

1:26:04.160 --> 1:26:11.780
 And so I think that there are, we have to hold together where our positive possibilities

1:26:11.780 --> 1:26:16.920
 and our risk possibilities are both increasing and then say for the positive possibilities

1:26:16.920 --> 1:26:22.640
 to be realized long term, all of the catastrophic risks have to not happen.

1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:26.640
 Any of the catastrophic risks happening is enough to keep that positive outcome from

1:26:26.640 --> 1:26:27.640
 occurring.

1:26:27.640 --> 1:26:30.020
 So how do we ensure that none of them happen?

1:26:30.020 --> 1:26:33.100
 If we want to say, let's have a civilization that doesn't collapse.

1:26:33.100 --> 1:26:38.960
 So again, Collapse Theory, it's worth looking at books like The Collapse of Complex Societies

1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:39.960
 by Joseph Tainter.

1:26:39.960 --> 1:26:49.640
 It does an analysis of that many of the societies fell for internal institutional decay, civilizational

1:26:49.640 --> 1:26:51.440
 decay reasons.

1:26:51.440 --> 1:26:55.720
 Baudrillard in Simulation and Simulacra looks at a very different way of looking at how

1:26:55.720 --> 1:26:59.720
 institutional decay and the collective intelligence of a system happens and it becomes kind of

1:26:59.720 --> 1:27:02.800
 more internally parasitic on itself.

1:27:02.800 --> 1:27:06.640
 Obviously Jared Diamond made a more popular book called Collapse.

1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:10.600
 And as we were mentioning, the anticatheria mechanism has been getting attention in the

1:27:10.600 --> 1:27:11.600
 news lately.

1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:14.240
 It was like a 2000 year old clock, right?

1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:15.960
 Like metal gears.

1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:23.800
 And does that mean we lost like 1500 years of technological progress?

1:27:23.800 --> 1:27:29.440
 And from a society that was relatively technologically advanced.

1:27:29.440 --> 1:27:35.720
 So what I'm interested in here is being able to say, okay, well, why did previous societies

1:27:35.720 --> 1:27:38.080
 fail?

1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:44.960
 Can we understand that abstractly enough that we can make a civilizational model that isn't

1:27:44.960 --> 1:27:49.480
 just trying to solve one type of failure, but solve the underlying things that generate

1:27:49.480 --> 1:27:51.560
 the failures as a whole?

1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:56.160
 Are there some underlying generator functions or patterns that would make a system self

1:27:56.160 --> 1:27:57.240
 terminating?

1:27:57.240 --> 1:28:00.600
 And can we solve those and have that be the kernel of a new civilizational model that

1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:02.960
 is not self terminating?

1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:06.920
 And can we then be able to actually look at the categories of extras we're aware of and

1:28:06.920 --> 1:28:10.440
 see that we actually have resilience in the presence of those?

1:28:10.440 --> 1:28:13.160
 Not just resilience, but antifragility.

1:28:13.160 --> 1:28:18.920
 And I would say for the optimism to be grounded, it has to actually be able to understand the

1:28:18.920 --> 1:28:22.540
 risk space well and have adequate solutions for it.

1:28:22.540 --> 1:28:31.860
 So can we try to dig into some basic intuitions about the underlying sources of catastrophic

1:28:31.860 --> 1:28:37.480
 failures of the system and overconsumption that's built in into self terminating systems?

1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:42.400
 So both the overconsumption, which is like the slow death, and then there's the fast

1:28:42.400 --> 1:28:45.720
 death of nuclear war and all those kinds of things.

1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:53.760
 AGI, biotech, bioengineering, nanotechnology, nano, my favorite nanobots.

1:28:53.760 --> 1:28:59.960
 Nanobots are my favorite because it sounds so cool to me that I could just know that

1:28:59.960 --> 1:29:06.160
 I would be one of the scientists that would be full steam ahead in building them without

1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:08.680
 sufficiently thinking about the negative consequences.

1:29:08.680 --> 1:29:14.080
 I would definitely be, I would be podcasting all about the negative consequences, but when

1:29:14.080 --> 1:29:20.800
 I go back home, I'd be, I'd just in my heart know the amount of excitement is a dumb descendant

1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:24.600
 of ape, no offense to apes.

1:29:24.600 --> 1:29:34.360
 I want to backtrack on my previous comments about, negative comments about apes.

1:29:34.360 --> 1:29:39.020
 That I have that sense of excitement that would result in problems.

1:29:39.020 --> 1:29:43.800
 So sorry, a lot of things said, but what's, can we start to pull it a thread because you've

1:29:43.800 --> 1:29:50.200
 also provided a kind of a beautiful general approach to this, which is this dialectic

1:29:50.200 --> 1:29:57.440
 synthesis or just rigorous empathy, whatever, whatever word we want to put to it, that seems

1:29:57.440 --> 1:30:01.960
 to be from the individual perspective as one way to sort of live in the world as we tried

1:30:01.960 --> 1:30:06.180
 to figure out how to construct non self terminating systems.

1:30:06.180 --> 1:30:08.200
 So what, what are some underlying sources?

1:30:08.200 --> 1:30:09.200
 Yeah.

1:30:09.200 --> 1:30:17.120
 First I have to say, I actually really respect Drexler for emphasizing Grey Goo and engines

1:30:17.120 --> 1:30:23.880
 of creation back in the day to make sure the world was paying adequate attention to the

1:30:23.880 --> 1:30:32.600
 risks of the nanotech as someone who was right at the cutting edge of what could be.

1:30:32.600 --> 1:30:37.360
 There's definitely game theoretic advantage to those who focus on the opportunities and

1:30:37.360 --> 1:30:46.800
 don't focus on the risks or pretend there aren't risks because they get to market first.

1:30:46.800 --> 1:30:51.360
 And then they externalize all of the costs through limited liability or whatever it is

1:30:51.360 --> 1:30:53.320
 to the commons or wherever happen to have it.

1:30:53.320 --> 1:30:56.640
 Other people are going to have to solve those, but now they have the power and capital associated.

1:30:56.640 --> 1:31:01.600
 The person who looked at the risks and tried to do better design and go slower is probably

1:31:01.600 --> 1:31:04.520
 not going to move into positions of as much power influences quickly.

1:31:04.520 --> 1:31:08.720
 So this is one of the issues we have to deal with is some of the bad game theoretic dispositions

1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:12.820
 in the system relative to its own stability.

1:31:12.820 --> 1:31:17.320
 And the key aspect to that, sorry to interrupt, is the externalities generated.

1:31:17.320 --> 1:31:18.680
 Yes.

1:31:18.680 --> 1:31:21.840
 What flavors of catastrophic risk are we talking about here?

1:31:21.840 --> 1:31:24.280
 What's your favorite flavor in terms of ice cream?

1:31:24.280 --> 1:31:25.920
 So mine is coconut.

1:31:25.920 --> 1:31:28.000
 Nobody seems to like coconut ice cream.

1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:36.000
 So ice cream aside, what are you most worried about in terms of catastrophic risk that will

1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:44.720
 help us kind of make concrete the discussion we're having about how to fix this whole thing?

1:31:44.720 --> 1:31:45.720
 Yeah.

1:31:45.720 --> 1:31:49.880
 I think it's worth taking a historical perspective briefly to just kind of orient everyone to

1:31:49.880 --> 1:31:50.880
 it.

1:31:50.880 --> 1:31:55.000
 We don't have to go all the way back to the aliens who've seen all of civilization.

1:31:55.000 --> 1:32:03.040
 But to just recognize that for all of human history, as far as we're aware, there were

1:32:03.040 --> 1:32:07.400
 existential risks to civilizations and they happened, right?

1:32:07.400 --> 1:32:12.940
 Like there were civilizations that were killed in war, tribes that were killed in tribal

1:32:12.940 --> 1:32:13.940
 warfare or whatever.

1:32:13.940 --> 1:32:18.220
 So people faced existential risk to the group that they identified with.

1:32:18.220 --> 1:32:20.500
 It's just those were local phenomena, right?

1:32:20.500 --> 1:32:22.040
 It wasn't a fully global phenomena.

1:32:22.040 --> 1:32:25.440
 So an empire could fall and surrounding empires didn't fall.

1:32:25.440 --> 1:32:30.020
 Maybe they came in and filled the space.

1:32:30.020 --> 1:32:35.720
 The first time that we were able to think about catastrophic risk, not from like a solar

1:32:35.720 --> 1:32:39.000
 flare or something that we couldn't control, but from something that humans would actually

1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:43.100
 create at a global level was World War II and the bomb.

1:32:43.100 --> 1:32:47.480
 Because it was the first time that we had tech big enough that could actually mess up

1:32:47.480 --> 1:32:50.140
 everything at a global level that could mess up habitability.

1:32:50.140 --> 1:32:53.120
 We just weren't powerful enough to do that before.

1:32:53.120 --> 1:32:55.160
 It's not that we didn't behave in ways that would have done it.

1:32:55.160 --> 1:32:59.520
 We just only behaved in those ways at the scale we could affect.

1:32:59.520 --> 1:33:04.680
 And so it's important to get that there's the entire world before World War II where

1:33:04.680 --> 1:33:09.340
 we don't have the ability to make a nonhabitable biosphere, nonhabitable for us.

1:33:09.340 --> 1:33:14.600
 And then there's World War II and the beginning of a completely new phase where global human

1:33:14.600 --> 1:33:18.640
 induced catastrophic risk is now a real thing.

1:33:18.640 --> 1:33:23.360
 And that was such a big deal that it changed the entire world in a really fundamental way,

1:33:23.360 --> 1:33:28.280
 which is, you know, when you study history, it's amazing how big a percentage of history

1:33:28.280 --> 1:33:32.840
 is studying war, right, and the history of war, as you said, European history and whatever.

1:33:32.840 --> 1:33:35.840
 It's generals and wars and empire expansions.

1:33:35.840 --> 1:33:40.720
 And so the major empires near each other never had really long periods of time where they

1:33:40.720 --> 1:33:45.480
 weren't engaged in war or preparation for war or something like that was – humans

1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:51.060
 don't have a good precedent in the post tribal phase, the civilization phase of being able

1:33:51.060 --> 1:33:54.720
 to solve conflicts without war for very long.

1:33:54.720 --> 1:34:00.920
 World War II was the first time where we could have a war that no one could win.

1:34:00.920 --> 1:34:02.880
 And so the superpowers couldn't fight again.

1:34:02.880 --> 1:34:04.320
 They couldn't do a real kinetic war.

1:34:04.320 --> 1:34:08.600
 They could do diplomatic wars and Cold War type stuff and they could fight proxy wars

1:34:08.600 --> 1:34:11.400
 through other countries that didn't have the big weapons.

1:34:11.400 --> 1:34:15.920
 And so mutually assured destruction and like coming out of World War II, we actually realized

1:34:15.920 --> 1:34:19.680
 that nation states couldn't prevent world war.

1:34:19.680 --> 1:34:23.920
 And so we needed a new type of supervening government in addition to nation states, which

1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:31.120
 was the whole Bretton Woods world, the United Nations, the World Bank, the IMF, the globalization

1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:36.240
 trade type agreements, mutually assured destruction that was how do we have some coordination

1:34:36.240 --> 1:34:42.280
 beyond just nation states between them since we have to stop war between at least the superpowers.

1:34:42.280 --> 1:34:48.040
 And it was pretty successful given that we've had like 75 years of no superpower on superpower

1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:50.920
 war.

1:34:50.920 --> 1:34:53.040
 We've had lots of proxy wars during that time.

1:34:53.040 --> 1:34:56.000
 We've had Cold War.

1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:01.840
 And I would say we're in a new phase now where the Bretton Woods solution is basically over

1:35:01.840 --> 1:35:02.840
 or almost over.

1:35:02.840 --> 1:35:05.160
 Can you describe the Bretton Woods solution?

1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:06.160
 Yeah.

1:35:06.160 --> 1:35:15.320
 So the Bretton Woods, the series of agreements for how the nations would be able to engage

1:35:15.320 --> 1:35:21.960
 with each other in a solution other than war was these IGOs, these intergovernmental organizations

1:35:21.960 --> 1:35:24.960
 and was the idea of globalization.

1:35:24.960 --> 1:35:28.160
 Since we could have global effects, we needed to be able to think about things globally

1:35:28.160 --> 1:35:32.480
 where we had trade relationships with each other where it would not be profitable to

1:35:32.480 --> 1:35:33.480
 war with each other.

1:35:33.480 --> 1:35:35.880
 It'd be more profitable to actually be able to trade with each other.

1:35:35.880 --> 1:35:42.480
 So our own self interest was gonna drive our non war interest.

1:35:42.480 --> 1:35:47.200
 And so this started to look like, and obviously this couldn't have happened that much earlier

1:35:47.200 --> 1:35:51.200
 either because industrialization hadn't gotten far enough to be able to do massive global

1:35:51.200 --> 1:35:54.800
 industrial supply chains and ship stuff around quickly.

1:35:54.800 --> 1:35:59.040
 But like we were mentioning earlier, almost all the electronics that we use today, just

1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:02.920
 basic cheap stuff for us is made on six continents, made in many countries.

1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:06.080
 There's no single country in the world that could actually make many of the things that

1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:12.760
 we have and from the raw material extraction to the plastics and polymers and the et cetera.

1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:18.240
 And so the idea that we made a world that could do that kind of trade and create massive

1:36:18.240 --> 1:36:22.360
 GDP growth, we could all work together to be able to mine natural resources and grow

1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:23.920
 stuff.

1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:28.320
 With the rapid GDP growth, there was the idea that everybody could keep having more without

1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:30.980
 having to take each other's stuff.

1:36:30.980 --> 1:36:35.520
 And so that was part of kind of the Bretton Woods post World War II model.

1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:38.920
 The other was that we'd be so economically interdependent that blowing each other up

1:36:38.920 --> 1:36:41.100
 would never make sense.

1:36:41.100 --> 1:36:43.600
 That worked for a while.

1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:51.560
 Now it also brought us up into planetary boundaries faster, the unrenewable use of resource and

1:36:51.560 --> 1:36:56.680
 turning those resources into pollution on the other side of the supply chain.

1:36:56.680 --> 1:37:02.840
 So obviously that faster GDP growth meant the overfishing of the oceans and the cutting

1:37:02.840 --> 1:37:08.400
 down of the trees and the climate change and the mining, toxic mining tailings going into

1:37:08.400 --> 1:37:11.880
 the water and the mountaintop removal mining and all those types of things.

1:37:11.880 --> 1:37:15.600
 That's the overconsumption side of the risk that we're talking about.

1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:23.700
 And so the answer of let's do positive GDP is the answer rapidly and exponentially obviously

1:37:23.700 --> 1:37:27.280
 accelerated the planetary boundary side.

1:37:27.280 --> 1:37:31.480
 And that started to be, that was thought about for a long time, but it started to be modeled

1:37:31.480 --> 1:37:38.080
 with the Club of Rome and limits of growth.

1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:41.240
 But it's just very obvious to say if you have a linear materials economy where you take

1:37:41.240 --> 1:37:47.280
 stuff out of the earth faster, whether it's fish or trees or oil, you take it out of the

1:37:47.280 --> 1:37:52.360
 earth faster than it can replenish itself and you turn it into trash after using it

1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:56.120
 for a short period of time, you put the trash in the environment faster than it can process

1:37:56.120 --> 1:37:59.960
 itself and there's toxicity associated with both sides of this.

1:37:59.960 --> 1:38:05.160
 You can't run an exponentially growing linear materials economy on a finite planet forever.

1:38:05.160 --> 1:38:07.020
 That's not a hard thing to figure out.

1:38:07.020 --> 1:38:11.900
 And it has to be exponential if there's an exponentiation in the monetary supply because

1:38:11.900 --> 1:38:16.500
 of interest and then fractional reserve banking and to then be able to keep up with the growing

1:38:16.500 --> 1:38:19.380
 monetary supply, you have to have growth of goods and services.

1:38:19.380 --> 1:38:24.740
 So that's that kind of thing that has happened.

1:38:24.740 --> 1:38:28.400
 But you also see that when you get these supply chains that are so interconnected across the

1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:33.220
 world, you get increased fragility because a collapse or a problem in one area then affects

1:38:33.220 --> 1:38:37.560
 the whole world in a much bigger area as opposed to the issues being local, right?

1:38:37.560 --> 1:38:43.200
 So we got to see with COVID and an issue that started in one part of China affecting the

1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:48.920
 whole world so much more rapidly than would have happened before Bretton Woods, right?

1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:52.760
 Before international travel, supply chains, you know, that whole kind of thing and with

1:38:52.760 --> 1:38:55.520
 a bunch of second and third order effects that people wouldn't have predicted, okay,

1:38:55.520 --> 1:39:01.940
 we have to stop certain kinds of travel because of viral contaminants, but the countries doing

1:39:01.940 --> 1:39:06.000
 agriculture depend upon fertilizer they don't produce that is shipped into them and depend

1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:07.440
 upon pesticides they don't produce.

1:39:07.440 --> 1:39:12.640
 So we got both crop failures and crops being eaten by locusts in scale in Northern Africa

1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:15.400
 and Iran and things like that because they couldn't get the supplies of stuff in.

1:39:15.400 --> 1:39:21.020
 So then you get massive starvation or future kind of hunger issues because of supply chain

1:39:21.020 --> 1:39:22.060
 shutdowns.

1:39:22.060 --> 1:39:26.440
 So you get this increased fragility and cascade dynamics where a small problem can end up

1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:29.420
 leading to cascade effects.

1:39:29.420 --> 1:39:40.360
 And also we went from two superpowers with one catastrophe weapon to now that same catastrophe

1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:46.980
 weapon is there's more countries that have it, eight or nine countries that have it,

1:39:46.980 --> 1:39:50.320
 and there's a lot more types of catastrophe weapons.

1:39:50.320 --> 1:39:54.980
 We now have catastrophe weapons with weaponized drones that can hit infrastructure targets

1:39:54.980 --> 1:39:59.800
 with bio, with in fact every new type of tech has created an arms race.

1:39:59.800 --> 1:40:04.500
 So we have not with the UN or the other kind of intergovernmental organizations, we haven't

1:40:04.500 --> 1:40:07.680
 been able to really do nuclear de proliferation.

1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:12.140
 We've actually had more countries get nukes and keep getting faster nukes, the race to

1:40:12.140 --> 1:40:15.260
 hypersonics and things like that.

1:40:15.260 --> 1:40:20.020
 And every new type of technology that has emerged has created an arms race.

1:40:20.020 --> 1:40:25.580
 And so you can't do mutually assured destruction with multiple agents the way you can with

1:40:25.580 --> 1:40:26.840
 two agents.

1:40:26.840 --> 1:40:31.700
 Two agents, it's much easier to create a stable Nash equilibrium that's forced.

1:40:31.700 --> 1:40:33.980
 But the ability to monitor and say if these guys shoot, who do I shoot?

1:40:33.980 --> 1:40:34.980
 Do I shoot them?

1:40:34.980 --> 1:40:35.980
 Do I shoot everybody?

1:40:35.980 --> 1:40:36.980
 Do I?

1:40:36.980 --> 1:40:37.980
 And so you get a three body problem.

1:40:37.980 --> 1:40:41.500
 You get a very complex type of thing when you have multiple agents and multiple different

1:40:41.500 --> 1:40:45.620
 types of catastrophe weapons, including ones that can be much more easily produced than

1:40:45.620 --> 1:40:46.620
 nukes.

1:40:46.620 --> 1:40:47.620
 Nukes are really hard to produce.

1:40:47.620 --> 1:40:48.620
 There's only uranium in a few areas.

1:40:48.620 --> 1:40:54.580
 uranium enrichment is hard, ICBMs are hard, but weaponized drones hitting smart targets

1:40:54.580 --> 1:40:55.580
 is not so hard.

1:40:55.580 --> 1:40:58.880
 There's a lot of other things where basically the scale at being able to manufacture them

1:40:58.880 --> 1:41:02.860
 is going way, way down to where even non state actors can have them.

1:41:02.860 --> 1:41:09.600
 And so when we talk about exponential tech and the decentralization of exponential tech,

1:41:09.600 --> 1:41:14.400
 what that means is decentralized catastrophe weapon capacity.

1:41:14.400 --> 1:41:19.400
 And especially in a world of increasing numbers of people feeling disenfranchised, frantic,

1:41:19.400 --> 1:41:21.460
 whatever for different reasons.

1:41:21.460 --> 1:41:27.540
 So I would say where the Bretton Woods world doesn't prepare us to be able to deal with

1:41:27.540 --> 1:41:31.900
 lots of different agents, having lots of different types of catastrophe weapons you can't put

1:41:31.900 --> 1:41:37.860
 mutually assured destruction on, where you can't keep doing growth of materials economy

1:41:37.860 --> 1:41:43.220
 in the same way because of hitting planetary boundaries and where the fragility dynamics

1:41:43.220 --> 1:41:46.180
 are actually now their own source of catastrophic risk.

1:41:46.180 --> 1:41:50.220
 So now we're, so like there was all the world until world war II and world war II is just

1:41:50.220 --> 1:41:54.020
 from a civilization timescale point of view is just a second ago.

1:41:54.020 --> 1:41:56.720
 It seems like a long time, but it is really not.

1:41:56.720 --> 1:42:00.280
 We get a short period of relative peace at the level of superpowers while building up

1:42:00.280 --> 1:42:04.540
 the military capacity for much, much, much worse war the entire time.

1:42:04.540 --> 1:42:09.420
 And then now we're at this new phase where the things that allowed us to make it through

1:42:09.420 --> 1:42:13.620
 the nuclear power are not the same systems that will let us make it through the next

1:42:13.620 --> 1:42:14.740
 stage.

1:42:14.740 --> 1:42:18.220
 So what is this next post Bretton Woods?

1:42:18.220 --> 1:42:26.140
 How do we become safe vessels, safe stewards of many different types of exponential technology

1:42:26.140 --> 1:42:30.140
 is a key question when we're thinking about X risk.

1:42:30.140 --> 1:42:31.140
 Okay.

1:42:31.140 --> 1:42:41.660
 And I'd like to try to answer the how a few ways, but first on the mutually assured destruction.

1:42:41.660 --> 1:42:49.700
 Do you give credit to the idea of two superpowers now blowing each other up with nuclear weapons

1:42:49.700 --> 1:42:54.900
 to the simple game theoretic model of mutually assured destruction or something you've said

1:42:54.900 --> 1:43:04.780
 previously this idea of inverse correlation, which I tend to believe between the, now you

1:43:04.780 --> 1:43:09.660
 were talking about tech, but I think it's maybe broadly true.

1:43:09.660 --> 1:43:14.020
 The inverse correlation between competence and propensity for destruction.

1:43:14.020 --> 1:43:22.140
 So the better, the, the, the bigger your weapons, not because you're afraid of a mutually assured

1:43:22.140 --> 1:43:27.980
 self destruction, but because we're human beings and there's a deep moral fortitude

1:43:27.980 --> 1:43:32.820
 there that somehow aligned with competence and being good at your job that like, it's

1:43:32.820 --> 1:43:42.340
 very hard to be a psychopath and be good at killing at scale.

1:43:42.340 --> 1:43:46.740
 Do you share any of that intuition?

1:43:46.740 --> 1:43:48.700
 Kind of.

1:43:48.700 --> 1:43:53.380
 I think most people would say that Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan and Napoleon were

1:43:53.380 --> 1:44:01.580
 effective people that were good at their job that were actually maybe asymmetrically good

1:44:01.580 --> 1:44:08.400
 at being able to organize people and do certain kinds of things that were pretty oriented

1:44:08.400 --> 1:44:13.860
 towards certain types of destruction or pretty willing to, maybe they would say they were

1:44:13.860 --> 1:44:18.240
 oriented towards empire expansion, but pretty willing to commit certain acts of destruction

1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:19.780
 in the name of it.

1:44:19.780 --> 1:44:20.780
 What are you worried about?

1:44:20.780 --> 1:44:27.860
 The Genghis Khan, or you could argue he's not a psychopath.

1:44:27.860 --> 1:44:31.820
 That are you worried about Genghis Khan, are you worried about Hitler or are you worried

1:44:31.820 --> 1:44:42.240
 about a terrorist who is, has a very different ethic, which is not even for, it's not trying

1:44:42.240 --> 1:44:46.740
 to preserve and build and expand my community.

1:44:46.740 --> 1:44:50.460
 It's more about just the destruction in itself is the goal.

1:44:50.460 --> 1:44:56.780
 I think the thing that you're looking at that I do agree with is that there's a psychological

1:44:56.780 --> 1:45:03.020
 disposition towards construction and a psychological disposition more towards destruction.

1:45:03.020 --> 1:45:07.740
 Obviously everybody has both and can toggle between both and oftentimes one is willing

1:45:07.740 --> 1:45:09.100
 to destroy certain things.

1:45:09.100 --> 1:45:11.020
 We have this idea of creative destruction, right?

1:45:11.020 --> 1:45:15.860
 Willing to destroy certain things to create other things and utilitarianism and trolley

1:45:15.860 --> 1:45:20.660
 problems are all about exploring that space and the idea of war is all about that.

1:45:20.660 --> 1:45:29.260
 I am trying to create something for our people and it requires destroying some other people.

1:45:29.260 --> 1:45:32.880
 Sociopathy is a funny topic because it's possible to have very high fealty to your in group

1:45:32.880 --> 1:45:38.380
 and work on perfecting the methods of torture to the out group at the same time because

1:45:38.380 --> 1:45:43.420
 you can dehumanize and then remove empathy.

1:45:43.420 --> 1:45:48.340
 And I would also say that there are types.

1:45:48.340 --> 1:45:55.160
 So the reason, the thing that gives hope about the orientation towards construction and destruction

1:45:55.160 --> 1:46:00.300
 being a little different in psychology is what it takes to build really catastrophic

1:46:00.300 --> 1:46:04.760
 tech, even today where it doesn't take what it took to make a nuke, a small group of people

1:46:04.760 --> 1:46:10.660
 could do it, takes still some real technical knowledge that required having studied for

1:46:10.660 --> 1:46:16.940
 a while and some then building capacity and there's a question of is that psychologically

1:46:16.940 --> 1:46:24.340
 inversely correlated with the desire to damage civilization meaningfully?

1:46:24.340 --> 1:46:25.340
 A little bit.

1:46:25.340 --> 1:46:27.980
 A little bit, I think.

1:46:27.980 --> 1:46:29.100
 I think a lot.

1:46:29.100 --> 1:46:34.100
 I think it's actually, I mean, this is the conversation I had like with, I think offline

1:46:34.100 --> 1:46:41.460
 with Dan Carlin, which is like, it's pretty easy to come up with ways that any competent,

1:46:41.460 --> 1:46:46.460
 I can come up with a lot of ways to hurt a lot of people and it's pretty easy, like I

1:46:46.460 --> 1:46:55.740
 alone could do it and there's a lot of people as smart or smarter than me, at least in their

1:46:55.740 --> 1:46:58.120
 creation of explosives.

1:46:58.120 --> 1:47:03.420
 Why are we not seeing more insane mass murder?

1:47:03.420 --> 1:47:10.500
 I think there's something fascinating and beautiful about this and it does have to do

1:47:10.500 --> 1:47:19.500
 with some deeply pro social types of characteristics in humans but when you're dealing with very

1:47:19.500 --> 1:47:24.260
 large numbers, you don't need a whole lot of a phenomena and so then you start to say,

1:47:24.260 --> 1:47:27.700
 well, what's the probability that X won't happen this year, then won't happen in the

1:47:27.700 --> 1:47:32.480
 next two years, three years, four years and then how many people are doing destructive

1:47:32.480 --> 1:47:36.340
 things with lower tech and then how many of them can get access to higher tech that they

1:47:36.340 --> 1:47:39.100
 didn't have to figure out how to build.

1:47:39.100 --> 1:47:47.180
 So when I can get commercial tech and maybe I don't understand tech very well but I understand

1:47:47.180 --> 1:47:51.460
 it well enough to utilize it, not to create it and I can repurpose it.

1:47:51.460 --> 1:47:57.780
 When we saw that commercial drone with a homemade thermite bomb hit the Ukrainian munitions

1:47:57.780 --> 1:48:03.860
 factory and do the equivalent of an incendiary bomb level of damage, that was just home tech,

1:48:03.860 --> 1:48:06.560
 that's just simple kind of thing.

1:48:06.560 --> 1:48:14.020
 And so the question is not does it stay being a small percentage of the population?

1:48:14.020 --> 1:48:24.140
 The question is can you bind that phenomena nearly completely and especially now as you

1:48:24.140 --> 1:48:29.140
 start to get into bigger things, CRISPR gene drive technologies and various things like

1:48:29.140 --> 1:48:36.020
 that, can you bind it completely long term over what period of time?

1:48:36.020 --> 1:48:38.100
 Not perfectly though, that's the thing.

1:48:38.100 --> 1:48:46.100
 I'm trying to say that there is some, let's call it, that's a random word, love, that's

1:48:46.100 --> 1:48:54.220
 inherent and that's core to human nature that's preventing destruction at scale.

1:48:54.220 --> 1:48:59.740
 And you're saying yeah but there's a lot of humans, there's going to be eight plus billion

1:48:59.740 --> 1:49:03.620
 and then there's a lot of seconds in the day to come up with stuff, there's a lot of pain

1:49:03.620 --> 1:49:08.580
 in the world that can lead to a distorted view of the world such that you want to channel

1:49:08.580 --> 1:49:12.780
 that pain into the destruction, all those kinds of things and it's only a matter of

1:49:12.780 --> 1:49:19.020
 time that any one individual can do large damage, especially as we create more and more

1:49:19.020 --> 1:49:23.420
 democratized decentralized ways to deliver that damage even if you don't know how to

1:49:23.420 --> 1:49:25.860
 build the initial weapon.

1:49:25.860 --> 1:49:37.180
 But the thing is it seems like it's a race between the cheapening of destructive weapons

1:49:37.180 --> 1:49:44.740
 and the capacity of humans to express their love towards each other and it's a race that

1:49:44.740 --> 1:49:52.020
 so far, I know on Twitter it's not popular to say but love is winning, okay?

1:49:52.020 --> 1:49:58.060
 So what is the argument that love is going to lose here against nuclear weapons and biotech

1:49:58.060 --> 1:50:02.380
 and AI and drones?

1:50:02.380 --> 1:50:07.940
 Okay I'm going to comment the end of this to a how love wins so I just want you to know

1:50:07.940 --> 1:50:09.660
 that that's where I'm oriented.

1:50:09.660 --> 1:50:10.660
 That's the end, okay.

1:50:10.660 --> 1:50:19.300
 But I'm going to argue against why that is a given because it's not a given, I don't

1:50:19.300 --> 1:50:20.860
 believe and I think that it's…

1:50:20.860 --> 1:50:25.420
 This is like a good romantic comedy so you're going to create drama right now but it will

1:50:25.420 --> 1:50:27.060
 end in a happy ending.

1:50:27.060 --> 1:50:30.420
 Well it's because it's only a happy ending if we actually understand the issues well

1:50:30.420 --> 1:50:32.580
 enough and take responsibility to shift it.

1:50:32.580 --> 1:50:37.500
 Do I believe like there's a reason why there's so much more dystopic sci fi than protopic

1:50:37.500 --> 1:50:45.960
 sci fi and the some protopic sci fi usually requires magic is because – or at least

1:50:45.960 --> 1:50:51.900
 magical tech, right, dilithium crystals and warp drives and stuff because it's very hard

1:50:51.900 --> 1:50:59.420
 to imagine people like the people we have been in the history books with exponential

1:50:59.420 --> 1:51:04.940
 type technology and power that don't eventually blow themselves up, that make good enough

1:51:04.940 --> 1:51:09.820
 choices as stewards of their environment and their commons and each other and etc.

1:51:09.820 --> 1:51:13.500
 So like it's easier to think of scenarios where we blow ourselves up than it is to think

1:51:13.500 --> 1:51:16.460
 of scenarios where we avoid every single scenario where we blow ourselves up.

1:51:16.460 --> 1:51:21.800
 And when I say blow ourselves up I mean the environmental versions, the terrorist versions,

1:51:21.800 --> 1:51:25.260
 the war versions, the cumulative externalities versions.

1:51:25.260 --> 1:51:33.740
 And I'm sorry if I'm interrupting your flow of thought but why is it easier?

1:51:33.740 --> 1:51:39.060
 Could it be a weird psychological thing where we either are just more capable to visualize

1:51:39.060 --> 1:51:44.580
 explosions and destruction and then the sicker thought which is like we kind of enjoy for

1:51:44.580 --> 1:51:48.900
 some weird reason thinking about that kind of stuff even though we wouldn't actually

1:51:48.900 --> 1:51:49.900
 act on it.

1:51:49.900 --> 1:51:56.300
 It's almost like some weird, like I love playing shooter games, you know, first person shooters

1:51:56.300 --> 1:52:01.420
 and like especially if it's like murdering zombies and doom, you're shooting demons.

1:52:01.420 --> 1:52:05.980
 I play one of my favorite games Diablo is like slashing through different monsters and

1:52:05.980 --> 1:52:11.320
 the screaming and pain and the hellfire and then I go out into the real world to eat my

1:52:11.320 --> 1:52:13.480
 coconut ice cream and I'm all about love.

1:52:13.480 --> 1:52:20.940
 So like can we trust our ability to visualize how it all goes to shit as an actual rational

1:52:20.940 --> 1:52:22.620
 way of thinking?

1:52:22.620 --> 1:52:28.740
 I think it's a fair question to say to what degree is there just kind of perverse fantasy

1:52:28.740 --> 1:52:37.060
 and morbid exploration and whatever else that happens in our imagination but I don't think

1:52:37.060 --> 1:52:38.060
 that's the whole of it.

1:52:38.060 --> 1:52:44.500
 I think there is also a reality to the combinatorial possibility space and the difference in the

1:52:44.500 --> 1:52:50.060
 probabilities that there's a lot of ways I could try to put the 70 trillion cells of

1:52:50.060 --> 1:52:53.180
 your body together that don't make you.

1:52:53.180 --> 1:52:55.260
 There's not that many ways I can put them together that make you.

1:52:55.260 --> 1:52:58.740
 There's a lot of ways I could try to connect the organs together that make some weird kind

1:52:58.740 --> 1:53:06.860
 of group of organs on a desk but that doesn't actually make a functioning human and you

1:53:06.860 --> 1:53:09.900
 can kill an adult human in a second but you can't get one in a second.

1:53:09.900 --> 1:53:12.700
 It takes 20 years to grow one and a lot of things happen right.

1:53:12.700 --> 1:53:18.660
 I could destroy this building in a couple of minutes with demolition but it took a year

1:53:18.660 --> 1:53:20.500
 or a couple of years to build it.

1:53:20.500 --> 1:53:21.500
 There is –

1:53:21.500 --> 1:53:23.900
 Calm down, Cole.

1:53:23.900 --> 1:53:25.220
 This is just an example.

1:53:25.220 --> 1:53:27.900
 He doesn't mean it.

1:53:27.900 --> 1:53:35.340
 There's a gradient where entropy is easier and there's a lot more ways to put a set

1:53:35.340 --> 1:53:38.940
 of things together that don't work than the few that really do produce higher order

1:53:38.940 --> 1:53:45.140
 synergies.

1:53:45.140 --> 1:53:51.300
 When we look at a history of war and then we look at exponentially more powerful warfare,

1:53:51.300 --> 1:53:54.540
 an arms race that drives that in all these directions, and when we look at a history

1:53:54.540 --> 1:53:58.340
 of environmental destruction and exponentially more powerful tech that makes exponential

1:53:58.340 --> 1:54:02.260
 externalities multiplied by the total number of agents that are doing it and the cumulative

1:54:02.260 --> 1:54:07.580
 effects, there's a lot of ways the whole thing can break, like a lot of different ways.

1:54:07.580 --> 1:54:12.020
 And for it to get ahead, it has to have none of those happen.

1:54:12.020 --> 1:54:18.060
 And so there's just a probability space where it's easier to imagine that thing.

1:54:18.060 --> 1:54:23.100
 So to say how do we have a protopic future, we have to say, well, one criteria must be

1:54:23.100 --> 1:54:25.800
 that it avoids all of the catastrophic risks.

1:54:25.800 --> 1:54:28.680
 So can we understand – can we inventory all the catastrophic risks?

1:54:28.680 --> 1:54:32.260
 Can we inventory the patterns of human behavior that give rise to them?

1:54:32.260 --> 1:54:35.100
 And could we try to solve for that?

1:54:35.100 --> 1:54:39.800
 And could we have that be the essence of the social technology that we're thinking about

1:54:39.800 --> 1:54:42.900
 to be able to guide, bind, and direct a new physical technology?

1:54:42.900 --> 1:54:47.860
 Because so far, our physical technology – like we were talking about the Genghis Khan's

1:54:47.860 --> 1:54:52.820
 like that, that obviously use certain kinds of physical technology and armaments and also

1:54:52.820 --> 1:54:57.960
 social technology and unconventional warfare for a particular set of purposes.

1:54:57.960 --> 1:55:04.300
 But we have things that don't look like warfare, like Rockefeller and Standard Oil.

1:55:04.300 --> 1:55:11.100
 And it looked like a constructive mindset to be able to bring this new energy resource

1:55:11.100 --> 1:55:14.060
 to the world, and it did.

1:55:14.060 --> 1:55:21.360
 And the second order effects of that are climate change and all of the oil spills that have

1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:26.820
 happened and will happen and all of the wars in the Middle East over the oil that have

1:55:26.820 --> 1:55:32.540
 been there and the massive political clusterfuck and human life issues that are associated

1:55:32.540 --> 1:55:36.540
 with it and on and on, right?

1:55:36.540 --> 1:55:44.180
 And so it's also not just the orientation to construct a thing can have a narrow focus

1:55:44.180 --> 1:55:47.900
 on what I'm trying to construct but be affecting a lot of other things through second and third

1:55:47.900 --> 1:55:51.140
 order effects I'm not taking responsibility for.

1:55:51.140 --> 1:55:57.300
 You often on another tangent mentioned second, third, and fourth order effects.

1:55:57.300 --> 1:55:58.300
 And order.

1:55:58.300 --> 1:55:59.300
 And order.

1:55:59.300 --> 1:56:00.300
 Cascading.

1:56:00.300 --> 1:56:02.020
 Which is really fascinating.

1:56:02.020 --> 1:56:09.460
 Like starting with the third order plus it gets really interesting because we don't

1:56:09.460 --> 1:56:11.940
 even acknowledge like the second order effects.

1:56:11.940 --> 1:56:12.940
 Right.

1:56:12.940 --> 1:56:17.540
 But like thinking because those it could get bigger and bigger and bigger in ways we were

1:56:17.540 --> 1:56:18.540
 not anticipating.

1:56:18.540 --> 1:56:20.200
 So how do we make those?

1:56:20.200 --> 1:56:27.460
 So it sounds like part of the thing that you are thinking through in terms of a solution

1:56:27.460 --> 1:56:38.540
 how to create an anti fragile, a resilient society is to make explicit acknowledge, understand

1:56:38.540 --> 1:56:44.840
 the externalities, the second order, third order, fourth order, and the order effects.

1:56:44.840 --> 1:56:47.020
 How do we start to think about those effects?

1:56:47.020 --> 1:56:52.300
 Yeah, the war application is harm we're trying to cause or that we're aware we're causing.

1:56:52.300 --> 1:56:53.300
 Right.

1:56:53.300 --> 1:56:58.060
 The externality is harm that at least supposedly we're not aware we're causing or at minimum

1:56:58.060 --> 1:56:59.060
 it's not our intention.

1:56:59.060 --> 1:57:00.060
 Right.

1:57:00.060 --> 1:57:03.340
 Maybe we're either totally unaware of it or we're aware of it but it is a side effect

1:57:03.340 --> 1:57:04.580
 of what our intention is.

1:57:04.580 --> 1:57:06.620
 It's not the intention itself.

1:57:06.620 --> 1:57:09.020
 There are catastrophic risks from both types.

1:57:09.020 --> 1:57:16.460
 The direct application of increased technological power to a rivalrous intent which is going

1:57:16.460 --> 1:57:19.740
 to cause harm for some out group, for some in group to win.

1:57:19.740 --> 1:57:23.500
 But the out group is also working on growing the tech and if they don't lose completely

1:57:23.500 --> 1:57:27.820
 they reverse engineer the tech, up regulate it, come back with more capacity.

1:57:27.820 --> 1:57:33.680
 So there's the exponential tech arms race side of in group, out group rivalry using

1:57:33.680 --> 1:57:36.380
 exponential tech that is one set of risks.

1:57:36.380 --> 1:57:44.480
 And the other set of risks is the application of exponentially more powerful tech not intentionally

1:57:44.480 --> 1:57:49.060
 to try and beat an out group but to try to achieve some goal that we have but to produce

1:57:49.060 --> 1:57:56.220
 a second and third order effects that do have harm to the commons, to other people, to environment,

1:57:56.220 --> 1:58:02.660
 to other groups that might actually be bigger problems than the problem we were originally

1:58:02.660 --> 1:58:05.400
 trying to solve with the thing we were building.

1:58:05.400 --> 1:58:10.800
 When Facebook was building a dating app and then building a social app where people could

1:58:10.800 --> 1:58:20.460
 tag pictures, they weren't trying to build a democracy destroying app that would maximize

1:58:20.460 --> 1:58:27.800
 time on site as part of its ad model through AI optimization of a newsfeed to the thing

1:58:27.800 --> 1:58:31.780
 that made people spend most time on site which is usually them being limbically hijacked

1:58:31.780 --> 1:58:37.380
 more than something else which ends up appealing to people's cognitive biases and group identities

1:58:37.380 --> 1:58:39.920
 and creates no sense of shared reality.

1:58:39.920 --> 1:58:45.220
 They weren't trying to do that but it was a second order effect and it's a pretty fucking

1:58:45.220 --> 1:58:51.580
 powerful second order effect and a pretty fast one because the rate of tech is obviously

1:58:51.580 --> 1:58:56.900
 able to get distributed to much larger scale much faster and with a bigger jump in terms

1:58:56.900 --> 1:59:00.600
 of total vertical capacity than that's what it means to get to the verticalizing part

1:59:00.600 --> 1:59:02.960
 of an exponential curve.

1:59:02.960 --> 1:59:09.800
 So just like we can see that oil had the second order environmental effects and also social

1:59:09.800 --> 1:59:11.560
 and political effects.

1:59:11.560 --> 1:59:19.100
 War and so much of the whole like the total amount of oil used has a proportionality to

1:59:19.100 --> 1:59:27.960
 total global GDP and this is why we have this the petrodollar and so the oil thing also

1:59:27.960 --> 1:59:32.240
 had the externalities of a major aspect of what happened with military industrial complex

1:59:32.240 --> 1:59:34.740
 and things like that.

1:59:34.740 --> 1:59:40.020
 But we can see the same thing with more current technologies with Facebook and Google and

1:59:40.020 --> 1:59:41.140
 other things.

1:59:41.140 --> 1:59:49.460
 So I don't think we can run and the more powerful the tech is, we build it for reason X, whatever

1:59:49.460 --> 1:59:51.260
 reason X is.

1:59:51.260 --> 1:59:55.180
 Maybe X is three things, maybe it's one thing, right?

1:59:55.180 --> 1:59:58.860
 We're doing the oil thing because we wanna make cars because it's a better method of

1:59:58.860 --> 2:00:01.980
 individual transportation, we're building the Facebook thing because we're gonna connect

2:00:01.980 --> 2:00:04.680
 people socially in a personal sphere.

2:00:04.680 --> 2:00:13.060
 But it interacts with complex systems, with ecologies, economies, psychologies, cultures,

2:00:13.060 --> 2:00:16.620
 and so it has effects on other than the thing we're intending.

2:00:16.620 --> 2:00:22.260
 Some of those effects can end up being negative effects, but because this technology, if we

2:00:22.260 --> 2:00:25.900
 make it to solve a problem, it has to overcome the problem.

2:00:25.900 --> 2:00:28.380
 The problem has been around for a while, it's gonna overcome in a short period of time.

2:00:28.380 --> 2:00:32.660
 So it usually has greater scale, greater rate of magnitude in some way.

2:00:32.660 --> 2:00:37.960
 That also means that the externalities that it creates might be bigger problems.

2:00:37.960 --> 2:00:40.780
 And you can say, well, but then that's the new problem and humanity will innovate its

2:00:40.780 --> 2:00:41.780
 way out of that.

2:00:41.780 --> 2:00:45.700
 Well, I don't think that's paying attention to the fact that we can't keep up with exponential

2:00:45.700 --> 2:00:52.640
 curves like that, nor do finite spaces allow exponential externalities forever.

2:00:52.640 --> 2:00:57.900
 And this is why a lot of the smartest people thinking about this are thinking, well, no,

2:00:57.900 --> 2:01:02.580
 I think we're totally screwed unless we can make a benevolent AI singleton that rules all

2:01:02.580 --> 2:01:03.580
 of us.

2:01:03.580 --> 2:01:10.280
 Guys like Ostrom and others thinking in those directions, because they're like, how do humans

2:01:10.280 --> 2:01:14.500
 try to do multipolarity and make it work?

2:01:14.500 --> 2:01:19.100
 And I have a different answer of what I think it looks like that does have more to do with

2:01:19.100 --> 2:01:22.940
 love, but some applied social tech aligned with love.

2:01:22.940 --> 2:01:28.260
 That's good, because I have a bunch of really dumb ideas I'd prefer to hear.

2:01:28.260 --> 2:01:30.020
 I'd like to hear some of them first.

2:01:30.020 --> 2:01:37.860
 I think the idea I would have is to be a bit more rigorous in trying to measure the amount

2:01:37.860 --> 2:01:46.580
 of love you add or subtract from the world in second, third, fourth, fifth order effects.

2:01:46.580 --> 2:01:52.500
 It's actually, I think, especially in the world of tech, quite doable.

2:01:52.500 --> 2:01:58.540
 You just might not like, the shareholders may not like that kind of metric, but it's

2:01:58.540 --> 2:02:01.340
 pretty easy to measure.

2:02:01.340 --> 2:02:07.940
 That's not even, I'm perhaps half joking about love, but we could talk about just happiness

2:02:07.940 --> 2:02:11.140
 and well being, long term well being.

2:02:11.140 --> 2:02:16.780
 That's pretty easy for Facebook, for YouTube, for all these companies to measure that.

2:02:16.780 --> 2:02:19.220
 They do a lot of kinds of surveys.

2:02:19.220 --> 2:02:25.060
 There's very simple solutions here that you could just survey how, I mean, servers are

2:02:25.060 --> 2:02:31.340
 in some sense useless because they're a subset of the population.

2:02:31.340 --> 2:02:35.100
 You're just trying to get a sense, it's very loose kind of understanding, but integrated

2:02:35.100 --> 2:02:37.320
 deeply as part of the technology.

2:02:37.320 --> 2:02:39.500
 Most of our tech is recommender systems.

2:02:39.500 --> 2:02:46.980
 Most of the, sorry, not tech, online interactions driven by recommender systems that learn very

2:02:46.980 --> 2:02:52.380
 little data about you and use that data based on, mostly based on traces of your previous

2:02:52.380 --> 2:02:54.660
 behavior to suggest future things.

2:02:54.660 --> 2:02:56.860
 This is how Twitter, this is how Facebook works.

2:02:56.860 --> 2:03:02.980
 This is how AdSense or Google AdSense works, this is how Netflix, YouTube work and so on.

2:03:02.980 --> 2:03:08.300
 And for them to just track as opposed to engagement, how much you spend in a particular video,

2:03:08.300 --> 2:03:16.060
 a particular site, is also track, give you the technology to do self report of what makes

2:03:16.060 --> 2:03:23.940
 you feel good, what makes you grow as a person, of what makes you, you know, the best version

2:03:23.940 --> 2:03:31.100
 of yourself, the Rogan idea of the hero of your movie.

2:03:31.100 --> 2:03:34.220
 And just add that little bit of information.

2:03:34.220 --> 2:03:39.580
 If you have people, you have this like happiness surveys of how you feel about the last five

2:03:39.580 --> 2:03:42.940
 days, how would you report your experience.

2:03:42.940 --> 2:03:45.020
 You can lay out the set of videos.

2:03:45.020 --> 2:03:48.460
 It's kind of fascinating, I don't know if you ever look at YouTube, the history of videos

2:03:48.460 --> 2:03:49.460
 you've looked at.

2:03:49.460 --> 2:03:50.460
 It's fascinating.

2:03:50.460 --> 2:03:52.340
 It's very embarrassing for me.

2:03:52.340 --> 2:03:57.740
 Like it'll be like a lecture and then like a set of videos that I don't want anyone to

2:03:57.740 --> 2:04:03.580
 know about, which is, which is, which will be like, I don't know, maybe like five videos

2:04:03.580 --> 2:04:07.220
 in a row where it looks like I watched the whole thing, which I probably did about like

2:04:07.220 --> 2:04:11.540
 how to cook a steak, even though, or just like with the best chefs in the world cooking

2:04:11.540 --> 2:04:17.020
 steaks and I'm just like sitting there watching it for no purpose whatsoever, wasting away

2:04:17.020 --> 2:04:23.540
 my life or like funny cat videos or like legit, that's always a good one.

2:04:23.540 --> 2:04:29.460
 And I could look back and rate which videos made me a better person and not.

2:04:29.460 --> 2:04:34.700
 And I mean, on a more serious note, there's a bunch of conversations, podcasts or lectures

2:04:34.700 --> 2:04:40.340
 I've watched, which made me a better person and some of them made me a worse person.

2:04:40.340 --> 2:04:45.820
 And honestly, not for stupid reasons, like I feel dumber, but because I do have a sense

2:04:45.820 --> 2:04:54.400
 that that started me on a path of, of not being kind to other people.

2:04:54.400 --> 2:04:58.740
 For example, I'll give you a, for my own, and I'm sorry for ranting, but maybe there's

2:04:58.740 --> 2:05:02.580
 some usefulness to this kind of exploration of self.

2:05:02.580 --> 2:05:11.640
 When I focus on creating, on programming, on science, I become a much deeper thinker

2:05:11.640 --> 2:05:14.600
 and a kinder person to others.

2:05:14.600 --> 2:05:20.540
 When I listen to too many, a little bit is good, but too many podcasts or videos about

2:05:20.540 --> 2:05:28.340
 how, how our world is melting down or criticizing ridiculous people, the worst of the quote

2:05:28.340 --> 2:05:30.060
 unquote woke, for example.

2:05:30.060 --> 2:05:35.820
 All there's all these groups that are misbehaving in fascinating ways because they've been corrupted

2:05:35.820 --> 2:05:37.100
 by power.

2:05:37.100 --> 2:05:44.260
 The more I watch, the more I watch criticism of them, the worse I become.

2:05:44.260 --> 2:05:49.240
 And I'm aware of this, but I'm also aware that for some reason it's pleasant to watch

2:05:49.240 --> 2:05:51.020
 those sometimes.

2:05:51.020 --> 2:05:56.440
 And so for, for me to be able to self report that to the YouTube algorithm, to the systems

2:05:56.440 --> 2:06:02.220
 around me, and they ultimately try to optimize to make me the best person, the best version

2:06:02.220 --> 2:06:06.460
 of myself, which I personally believe would make YouTube a lot more money because I'd

2:06:06.460 --> 2:06:11.380
 be much more willing to spend time on YouTube and give YouTube a lot more, a lot more of

2:06:11.380 --> 2:06:12.380
 my money.

2:06:12.380 --> 2:06:17.700
 That's a, that's great for business and great for humanity because it'll make me a kinder

2:06:17.700 --> 2:06:18.700
 person.

2:06:18.700 --> 2:06:25.420
 It'll increase the love quotient, the love metric, and it'll make them a lot of money.

2:06:25.420 --> 2:06:27.100
 I feel like everything's aligned.

2:06:27.100 --> 2:06:31.980
 And so you, you should do that not just for YouTube algorithm, but also for military strategy

2:06:31.980 --> 2:06:36.620
 and whether you go to war or not, because one externality you can think of about going

2:06:36.620 --> 2:06:42.660
 to war, which I think we talked about offline is we often go to war with kind of governments

2:06:42.660 --> 2:06:46.100
 with a, with, not with the people.

2:06:46.100 --> 2:06:57.280
 You have to think about the kids of countries that see a soldier and because of what they

2:06:57.280 --> 2:07:01.780
 experienced the interaction with the soldier, hate is born.

2:07:01.780 --> 2:07:07.140
 When you're like eight years old, six years old, you lose your dad, you lose your mom,

2:07:07.140 --> 2:07:12.180
 you lose a friend, somebody close to you that want a really powerful externality that could

2:07:12.180 --> 2:07:19.500
 be reduced to love, positive and negative is the hate that's born when you make decisions.

2:07:19.500 --> 2:07:25.300
 And that's going to take fruition that that little seed is going to become a tree that

2:07:25.300 --> 2:07:30.860
 then leads to the kind of destruction that we talk about.

2:07:30.860 --> 2:07:35.340
 So but in my sense, it's possible to reduce everything to a measure of how much love does

2:07:35.340 --> 2:07:38.700
 this add to the world.

2:07:38.700 --> 2:07:48.060
 All that to say, do you have ideas of how we practically build systems that create a

2:07:48.060 --> 2:07:49.060
 resilient society?

2:07:49.060 --> 2:07:55.100
 There were a lot of good things that you shared where there's like 15 different ways that

2:07:55.100 --> 2:07:57.180
 we could enter this that are all interesting.

2:07:57.180 --> 2:08:00.020
 So I'm trying to see which one will probably be most useful.

2:08:00.020 --> 2:08:03.180
 Pick the one or two things that are least ridiculous.

2:08:03.180 --> 2:08:11.340
 When you were mentioning if we could see some of the second order effects or externalities

2:08:11.340 --> 2:08:15.420
 that we aren't used to seeing, specifically the one of a kid being radicalized somewhere

2:08:15.420 --> 2:08:20.400
 else, which engenders enmity in them towards us, which decreases our own future security.

2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:24.100
 Even if you don't care about the kid, if you care about the kid, it's a whole other thing.

2:08:24.100 --> 2:08:30.180
 Yeah, I mean, I think when we saw this, when Jane Fonda and others went to Vietnam and

2:08:30.180 --> 2:08:34.700
 took photos and videos of what was happening, and you got to see the pictures of the kids

2:08:34.700 --> 2:08:42.260
 with napalm on them, that like the antiwar effort was bolstered by that in a way it couldn't

2:08:42.260 --> 2:08:45.780
 have been without that.

2:08:45.780 --> 2:08:50.220
 Until we can see the images, you can't have a mere neuron effect in the same way.

2:08:50.220 --> 2:08:53.260
 And when you can, that starts to have a powerful effect.

2:08:53.260 --> 2:09:01.980
 I think there's a deep principle that you're sharing there, which is that if we can have

2:09:01.980 --> 2:09:07.660
 a rivalrous intent where our in group, whatever it is, maybe it's our political party wanting

2:09:07.660 --> 2:09:13.860
 to win within the US, maybe it's our nation state wanting to win in a war or an economic

2:09:13.860 --> 2:09:19.860
 war over resource or whatever it is, that if we don't obliterate the other people completely,

2:09:19.860 --> 2:09:27.260
 they don't go away, they're not engendered to like us more, they didn't become less smart.

2:09:27.260 --> 2:09:31.300
 So they have more enmity towards us and whatever technologies we employed to be successful,

2:09:31.300 --> 2:09:35.500
 they will now reverse engineer, make iterations on and come back.

2:09:35.500 --> 2:09:42.140
 And so you drive an arms race, which is why you can see that the wars were over history

2:09:42.140 --> 2:09:46.020
 employing more lethal weaponry.

2:09:46.020 --> 2:09:53.300
 And not just the kinetic war, the information war and the narrative war and the economic

2:09:53.300 --> 2:09:58.420
 war, like it just increased capacity in all of those fronts.

2:09:58.420 --> 2:10:04.300
 And so what seems like a win to us on the short term might actually really produce losses

2:10:04.300 --> 2:10:05.460
 in the long term.

2:10:05.460 --> 2:10:08.760
 And what's even in our own best interest in the long term is probably more aligned with

2:10:08.760 --> 2:10:11.020
 everyone else because we inter affect each other.

2:10:11.020 --> 2:10:16.860
 And I think the thing about globalism, globalization and exponential tech and the rate at which

2:10:16.860 --> 2:10:19.780
 we affect each other and the rate at which we affect the biosphere that we're all affected

2:10:19.780 --> 2:10:28.240
 by is that this kind of proverbial spiritual idea that we're all interconnected and need

2:10:28.240 --> 2:10:33.420
 to think about that in some way, that was easy for tribes to get because everyone in

2:10:33.420 --> 2:10:37.900
 the tribes so clearly saw their interconnection and dependence on each other.

2:10:37.900 --> 2:10:43.820
 But in terms of a global level, the speed at which we are actually interconnected, the

2:10:43.820 --> 2:10:48.020
 speed at which the harm happening to something in Wuhan affects the rest of the world or

2:10:48.020 --> 2:10:52.320
 a new technology developed somewhere affects the entire world or an environmental issue

2:10:52.320 --> 2:10:58.220
 or whatever is making it to where we either actually all get, not as a spiritual idea,

2:10:58.220 --> 2:10:59.580
 just even as physics, right?

2:10:59.580 --> 2:11:04.340
 We all get the interconnectedness of everything and that we either all consider that and see

2:11:04.340 --> 2:11:10.580
 how to make it through more effectively together or failures anywhere end up becoming decreased

2:11:10.580 --> 2:11:12.820
 quality of life and failures and increased risk everywhere.

2:11:12.820 --> 2:11:16.540
 Don't you think people are beginning to experience that at the individual level?

2:11:16.540 --> 2:11:18.700
 So governments are resisting it.

2:11:18.700 --> 2:11:21.780
 They're trying to make us not empathize with each other, feel connected.

2:11:21.780 --> 2:11:25.060
 But don't you think people are beginning to feel more and more connected?

2:11:25.060 --> 2:11:27.940
 Like isn't that exactly what the technology is enabling?

2:11:27.940 --> 2:11:34.740
 Like social networks, we tend to criticize them, but isn't there a sense which we're

2:11:34.740 --> 2:11:37.180
 experiencing, you know?

2:11:37.180 --> 2:11:43.900
 When you watch those videos that are criticizing, whether it's the woke Antifa side or the QAnon

2:11:43.900 --> 2:11:50.100
 Trump supporter side, does it seem like they have increased empathy for people that are

2:11:50.100 --> 2:11:51.700
 outside of their ideologic camp?

2:11:51.700 --> 2:11:52.700
 Not at all.

2:11:52.700 --> 2:12:04.620
 I may be conflating my own experience of the world and that of the populace.

2:12:04.620 --> 2:12:12.140
 I tend to see those videos as feeding something that's a relic of the past.

2:12:12.140 --> 2:12:19.540
 They figured out that drama fuels clicks, but whether I'm right or wrong, I don't know.

2:12:19.540 --> 2:12:26.300
 But I tend to sense that that is not, that hunger for drama is not fundamental to human

2:12:26.300 --> 2:12:34.860
 beings that we want to actually, that we want to understand Antifa and we want to empathize.

2:12:34.860 --> 2:12:41.820
 We want to take radical ideas and be able to empathize with them and synthesize it all.

2:12:41.820 --> 2:12:51.980
 Okay, let's look at cultural outliers in terms of violence versus compassion.

2:12:51.980 --> 2:12:58.020
 We can see that a lot of cultures have relatively lower in group violence, bigger out group

2:12:58.020 --> 2:13:01.500
 violence, and there's some variance in them and variance at different times based on the

2:13:01.500 --> 2:13:04.660
 scarcity or abundance of resource and other things.

2:13:04.660 --> 2:13:12.180
 But you can look at say, Janes, whose whole religion is around nonviolence so much so

2:13:12.180 --> 2:13:16.860
 that they don't even hurt plants, they only take fruits that fall off them and stuff.

2:13:16.860 --> 2:13:21.340
 Or to go to a larger population, you could take Buddhists, where for the most part, with

2:13:21.340 --> 2:13:25.780
 a few exceptions, for the most part across three millennia and across lots of different

2:13:25.780 --> 2:13:30.620
 countries and geographies and whatever, you have 10 million people plus or minus who don't

2:13:30.620 --> 2:13:33.100
 hurt bugs.

2:13:33.100 --> 2:13:36.420
 The whole spectrum of genetic variance that is happening within a culture of that many

2:13:36.420 --> 2:13:41.980
 people and head traumas and whatever, and nobody hurts bugs.

2:13:41.980 --> 2:13:47.580
 And then you look at a group where the kids grew up as child soldiers in Liberia or Darfur

2:13:47.580 --> 2:13:51.700
 were to make it to adulthood, pretty much everybody's killed people hand to hand and

2:13:51.700 --> 2:13:54.860
 killed people who were civilian or innocent type of people.

2:13:54.860 --> 2:14:00.260
 And you say, okay, so we were very neotenous, we can be conditioned by our environment and

2:14:00.260 --> 2:14:05.660
 humans can be conditioned where almost all the humans show up in these two different

2:14:05.660 --> 2:14:06.660
 bell curves.

2:14:06.660 --> 2:14:08.980
 It doesn't mean that the Buddhists had no violence, it doesn't mean that these people

2:14:08.980 --> 2:14:14.460
 had no compassion, but they're very different Gaussian distributions.

2:14:14.460 --> 2:14:20.460
 And so I think one of the important things that I like to do is look at the examples

2:14:20.460 --> 2:14:28.860
 of the populations, what Buddhism shows regarding compassion or what Judaism shows around education,

2:14:28.860 --> 2:14:32.460
 the average level of education that everybody gets because of a culture that is really working

2:14:32.460 --> 2:14:35.500
 on conditioning it or various cultures.

2:14:35.500 --> 2:14:41.680
 What are the positive deviance outside of the statistical deviance to see what is actually

2:14:41.680 --> 2:14:47.060
 possible and then say, what are the conditioning factors and can we condition those across

2:14:47.060 --> 2:14:52.020
 a few of them simultaneously and could we build a civilization like that becomes a very

2:14:52.020 --> 2:14:53.500
 interesting question.

2:14:53.500 --> 2:14:59.340
 So there's this kind of real politic idea that humans are violent, large groups of humans

2:14:59.340 --> 2:15:03.900
 become violent, they become irrational, specifically those two things, rivalrous and violent and

2:15:03.900 --> 2:15:05.180
 irrational.

2:15:05.180 --> 2:15:08.980
 And so in order to minimize the total amount of violence and have some good decisions,

2:15:08.980 --> 2:15:10.780
 they need ruled somehow.

2:15:10.780 --> 2:15:15.400
 And that not getting that is some kind of naive utopianism that doesn't understand human

2:15:15.400 --> 2:15:16.400
 nature yet.

2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:20.140
 This gets back to like mimesis of desire as an inexorable thing.

2:15:20.140 --> 2:15:26.560
 I think the idea of the masses is actually a kind of propaganda that is useful for the

2:15:26.560 --> 2:15:37.380
 classes that control to popularize the idea that most people are too violent, lazy, undisciplined

2:15:37.380 --> 2:15:42.300
 and irrational to make good choices and therefore their choices should be sublimated in some

2:15:42.300 --> 2:15:43.300
 kind of way.

2:15:43.300 --> 2:15:50.060
 I think that if we look back at these conditioning environments, we can say, okay, so the kids

2:15:50.060 --> 2:15:58.260
 that go to a really fancy school and have a good developmental environment like Exeter

2:15:58.260 --> 2:16:03.540
 Academy, there's still a Gaussian distribution of how well they do on any particular metric,

2:16:03.540 --> 2:16:09.300
 but on average, they become senators and the worst ones become high end lawyers or whatever.

2:16:09.300 --> 2:16:12.340
 And then I look at the inner city school with a totally different set of things and I see

2:16:12.340 --> 2:16:15.500
 a very, very differently displaced Gaussian distribution, but a very different set of

2:16:15.500 --> 2:16:16.500
 conditioning factors.

2:16:16.500 --> 2:16:20.380
 And then I say the masses, well, if all those kids who were one of the parts of the masses

2:16:20.380 --> 2:16:25.140
 got to go to Exeter and have that family and whatever, would they still be the masses?

2:16:25.140 --> 2:16:32.140
 Could we actually condition more social virtue, more civic virtue, more orientation towards

2:16:32.140 --> 2:16:37.580
 dialectical synthesis, more empathy, more rationality widely?

2:16:37.580 --> 2:16:39.940
 Yes.

2:16:39.940 --> 2:16:45.180
 Would that lead to better capacity for something like participatory governance, democracy or

2:16:45.180 --> 2:16:47.940
 republic or some kind of participatory governance?

2:16:47.940 --> 2:16:48.940
 Yes.

2:16:48.940 --> 2:16:49.940
 Yes.

2:16:49.940 --> 2:16:52.500
 Is it necessary for it actually?

2:16:52.500 --> 2:16:54.060
 Yes.

2:16:54.060 --> 2:16:57.580
 And is it good for class interests?

2:16:57.580 --> 2:16:58.580
 Not really.

2:16:58.580 --> 2:17:03.540
 By the way, when you say class interests, this is the powerful leading over the less

2:17:03.540 --> 2:17:06.800
 powerful, that kind of idea.

2:17:06.800 --> 2:17:12.780
 Anyone that benefits from asymmetries of power doesn't necessarily benefit from decreasing

2:17:12.780 --> 2:17:20.340
 those asymmetries of power and kind of increasing the capacity of people more widely.

2:17:20.340 --> 2:17:28.100
 And so, when we talk about power, we're talking about asymmetries in agency, influence and

2:17:28.100 --> 2:17:29.100
 control.

2:17:29.100 --> 2:17:33.180
 Do you think that hunger for power is fundamental to human nature?

2:17:33.180 --> 2:17:36.020
 I think we should get that straight before we talk about other stuff.

2:17:36.020 --> 2:17:43.440
 So like this pick up line that I use at a bar often, which is power corrupts and absolute

2:17:43.440 --> 2:17:45.560
 power corrupts, absolutely.

2:17:45.560 --> 2:17:48.760
 Is that true or is that just a fancy thing to say?

2:17:48.760 --> 2:17:55.080
 In modern society, there's something to be said, have we changed as societies over time

2:17:55.080 --> 2:17:58.100
 in terms of how much we crave power?

2:17:58.100 --> 2:18:03.260
 That there is an impulse towards power that is innate in people and can be conditioned

2:18:03.260 --> 2:18:06.840
 one way or the other, yes, but you can see that Buddhist society does a very different

2:18:06.840 --> 2:18:13.100
 thing with it at scale, that you don't end up seeing the emergence of the same types

2:18:13.100 --> 2:18:21.460
 of sociopathic behavior and particularly then creating sociopathic institutions.

2:18:21.460 --> 2:18:28.220
 And so, it's like, is eating the foods that were rare in our evolutionary environment

2:18:28.220 --> 2:18:31.820
 that give us more dopamine hit because they were rare and they're not anymore, salt,

2:18:31.820 --> 2:18:33.220
 sugar?

2:18:33.220 --> 2:18:37.560
 Is there something pleasurable about those where humans have an orientation to overeat

2:18:37.560 --> 2:18:38.560
 if they can?

2:18:38.560 --> 2:18:42.740
 Well, the fact that there is that possibility doesn't mean everyone will obligately be obese

2:18:42.740 --> 2:18:44.020
 and die of obesity, right?

2:18:44.020 --> 2:18:49.900
 Like it's possible to have a particular impulse and to be able to understand it, have other

2:18:49.900 --> 2:18:52.780
 ones and be able to balance them.

2:18:52.780 --> 2:19:00.460
 And so, to say that power dynamics are obligate in humans and we can't do anything about it

2:19:00.460 --> 2:19:05.460
 is very similar to me to saying like everyone is going to be obligately obese.

2:19:05.460 --> 2:19:06.460
 Yeah.

2:19:06.460 --> 2:19:10.640
 So, there's some degree to which the control of those impulses has to do with the conditioning

2:19:10.640 --> 2:19:11.640
 early in life.

2:19:11.640 --> 2:19:12.640
 Yes.

2:19:12.640 --> 2:19:16.940
 And the culture that creates the environment to be able to do that and then the recursion

2:19:16.940 --> 2:19:17.940
 on that.

2:19:17.940 --> 2:19:18.940
 Okay.

2:19:18.940 --> 2:19:24.060
 So, if we were to, bear with me, just asking for a friend, if we're to kill all humans

2:19:24.060 --> 2:19:32.740
 on Earth and then start over, is there ideas about how to build up, okay, we don't have

2:19:32.740 --> 2:19:38.220
 to kill, let's leave the humans on Earth, they're fine and go to Mars and start a new

2:19:38.220 --> 2:19:39.220
 society.

2:19:39.220 --> 2:19:47.340
 Is there ways to construct systems of conditioning, education of how we live with each other that

2:19:47.340 --> 2:19:57.980
 would incentivize us properly to not seek power, to not construct systems that are of

2:19:57.980 --> 2:20:03.460
 asymmetry of power and to create systems that are resilient to all kinds of terrorist attacks,

2:20:03.460 --> 2:20:06.540
 to all kinds of destructions?

2:20:06.540 --> 2:20:08.460
 I believe so.

2:20:08.460 --> 2:20:10.300
 Is there some inclination?

2:20:10.300 --> 2:20:14.620
 Of course, you probably don't have all the answers, but you have insights about what

2:20:14.620 --> 2:20:15.620
 that looks like.

2:20:15.620 --> 2:20:16.620
 Yeah.

2:20:16.620 --> 2:20:23.380
 It's just rigorous practice of dialectic synthesis as essentially conversations with assholes

2:20:23.380 --> 2:20:28.420
 of various flavors until they're not assholes anymore because you become deeply empathetic

2:20:28.420 --> 2:20:29.420
 with their experience.

2:20:29.420 --> 2:20:30.420
 Okay.

2:20:30.420 --> 2:20:37.620
 So, there's a lot of things that we would need to construct to come back to this, like

2:20:37.620 --> 2:20:39.700
 what is the basis of rivalry?

2:20:39.700 --> 2:20:41.020
 How do you bind it?

2:20:41.020 --> 2:20:43.460
 How does it relate to tech?

2:20:43.460 --> 2:20:48.180
 If you have a culture that is doing less rivalry, does it always lose in war to those who do

2:20:48.180 --> 2:20:49.180
 war better?

2:20:49.180 --> 2:20:52.460
 And how do you make something on the enactment of how to get there from here?

2:20:52.460 --> 2:20:53.700
 Great, great.

2:20:53.700 --> 2:20:54.700
 So what's rivalry?

2:20:54.700 --> 2:20:58.980
 Well, is rivalry bad or good?

2:20:58.980 --> 2:21:01.980
 So is another word for rivalry competition?

2:21:01.980 --> 2:21:05.380
 Yes, I think roughly, yes.

2:21:05.380 --> 2:21:10.640
 I think bad and good are kind of silly concepts here.

2:21:10.640 --> 2:21:12.700
 Good for some things, bad for other things.

2:21:12.700 --> 2:21:15.820
 Bad for some contexts and others.

2:21:15.820 --> 2:21:16.820
 Even that.

2:21:16.820 --> 2:21:17.820
 Okay.

2:21:17.820 --> 2:21:21.700
 Let me give you an example that relates back to the Facebook measuring thing you were mentioning

2:21:21.700 --> 2:21:23.300
 a moment ago.

2:21:23.300 --> 2:21:27.580
 First, I think what you're saying is actually aligned with the right direction and what

2:21:27.580 --> 2:21:32.300
 I want to get to in a moment, but it's not, the devil is in the details here.

2:21:32.300 --> 2:21:36.720
 So I enjoy praise, it feeds my ego, I grow stronger.

2:21:36.720 --> 2:21:37.720
 So I appreciate that.

2:21:37.720 --> 2:21:42.420
 I will make sure to include one piece every 15 minutes as we go.

2:21:42.420 --> 2:21:53.860
 So it's easier to measure, there are problems with this argument, but there's also utility

2:21:53.860 --> 2:21:54.860
 to it.

2:21:54.860 --> 2:21:59.340
 So let's take it for the utility it has first.

2:21:59.340 --> 2:22:04.960
 It's harder to measure happiness than it is to measure comfort.

2:22:04.960 --> 2:22:10.780
 We can measure with technology that the shocks in a car are making the car bounce less, that

2:22:10.780 --> 2:22:16.340
 the bed is softer and, you know, material science and those types of things.

2:22:16.340 --> 2:22:23.180
 And happiness is actually hard for philosophers to define because some people find that there's

2:22:23.180 --> 2:22:26.220
 certain kinds of overcoming suffering that are necessary for happiness.

2:22:26.220 --> 2:22:30.180
 There's happiness that feels more like contentment and happiness that feels more like passion.

2:22:30.180 --> 2:22:32.780
 Is passion the source of all suffering or the source of all creativity?

2:22:32.780 --> 2:22:37.380
 Like there's deep stuff and it's mostly first person, not measurable third person stuff,

2:22:37.380 --> 2:22:40.860
 even if maybe it corresponds to third person stuff to some degree.

2:22:40.860 --> 2:22:45.260
 But we also see examples of some of our favorite examples as people who are in the worst environments

2:22:45.260 --> 2:22:49.100
 who end up finding happiness, right, where the third person stuff looks to be less conducive

2:22:49.100 --> 2:22:54.420
 and there's some Victor Frankl, Nelson Mandela, whatever.

2:22:54.420 --> 2:22:57.540
 But it's pretty easy to measure comfort and it's pretty universal.

2:22:57.540 --> 2:23:01.760
 And I think we can see that the Industrial Revolution started to replace happiness with

2:23:01.760 --> 2:23:05.260
 comfort quite heavily as the thing it was optimizing for.

2:23:05.260 --> 2:23:09.020
 And we can see that when increased comfort is given, maybe because of the evolutionary

2:23:09.020 --> 2:23:14.400
 disposition that expending extra calories when for the majority of our history we didn't

2:23:14.400 --> 2:23:17.420
 have extra calories was not a safe thing to do.

2:23:17.420 --> 2:23:19.660
 Who knows why?

2:23:19.660 --> 2:23:25.820
 When extra comfort is given, it's very easy to take that path, even if it's not the path

2:23:25.820 --> 2:23:29.220
 that supports overall well being long term.

2:23:29.220 --> 2:23:37.500
 And so, we can see that, you know, when you look at the techno optimist idea that we have

2:23:37.500 --> 2:23:41.780
 better lives than Egyptian pharaohs and kings and whatever, what they're largely looking

2:23:41.780 --> 2:23:47.980
 at is how comfortable our beds are and how comfortable the transportation systems are

2:23:47.980 --> 2:23:50.340
 and things like that, in which case there's massive improvement.

2:23:50.340 --> 2:23:54.700
 But we also see that in some of the nations where people have access to the most comfort,

2:23:54.700 --> 2:23:57.500
 suicide and mental illness are the highest.

2:23:57.500 --> 2:24:01.420
 And we also see that some of the happiest cultures are actually some of the ones that

2:24:01.420 --> 2:24:04.220
 are in materially lame environments.

2:24:04.220 --> 2:24:08.260
 And so, there's a very interesting question here, and if I understand correctly, you do

2:24:08.260 --> 2:24:13.900
 cold showers, and Joe Rogan was talking about how he needs to do some fairly intensive kind

2:24:13.900 --> 2:24:21.040
 of struggle that is a non comfort to actually induce being better as a person, this concept

2:24:21.040 --> 2:24:27.560
 of hormesis, that it's actually stressing an adaptive system that increases its adaptive

2:24:27.560 --> 2:24:33.020
 capacity, and that there's something that the happiness of a system has something to

2:24:33.020 --> 2:24:37.000
 do with its adaptive capacity, its overall resilience, health, well being, which requires

2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:40.020
 a decent bit of discomfort.

2:24:40.020 --> 2:24:46.220
 And yet, in the presence of the comfort solution, it's very hard to not choose it, and then

2:24:46.220 --> 2:24:51.800
 as you're choosing it regularly, to actually down regulate your overall adaptive capacity.

2:24:51.800 --> 2:25:00.460
 And so, when we start saying, can we make tech where we're measuring for the things

2:25:00.460 --> 2:25:06.580
 that it produces beyond just the measure of GDP or whatever particular measures look like

2:25:06.580 --> 2:25:13.660
 the revenue generation or profit generation of my business, are all the meaningful things

2:25:13.660 --> 2:25:20.020
 measurable, and what are the right measures, and what are the externalities of optimizing

2:25:20.020 --> 2:25:23.660
 for that measurement set, what meaningful things aren't included in that measurement

2:25:23.660 --> 2:25:27.100
 set, that might have their own externalities, these are some of the questions we actually

2:25:27.100 --> 2:25:28.100
 have to take seriously.

2:25:28.100 --> 2:25:31.140
 Yeah, and I think they're answerable questions, right?

2:25:31.140 --> 2:25:33.020
 Progressively better, not perfect.

2:25:33.020 --> 2:25:37.740
 Right, so first of all, let me throw out happiness and comfort out of the discussion, those seem

2:25:37.740 --> 2:25:43.500
 like useless, the distinction, because I said they're useful, well being is useful, but

2:25:43.500 --> 2:25:47.940
 I think I take it back.

2:25:47.940 --> 2:25:59.180
 I propose new metrics in this brainstorm session, which is, so one is like personal growth,

2:25:59.180 --> 2:26:05.700
 which is intellectual growth, I think we're able to make that concrete for ourselves,

2:26:05.700 --> 2:26:11.540
 like you're a better person than you were a week ago, or a worse person than you were

2:26:11.540 --> 2:26:12.540
 a week ago.

2:26:12.540 --> 2:26:18.380
 I think we can ourselves report that, and understand what that means, it's this grey

2:26:18.380 --> 2:26:22.940
 area, and we try to define it, but I think we humans are pretty good at that, because

2:26:22.940 --> 2:26:27.220
 we have a sense, an idealistic sense of the person we might be able to become.

2:26:27.220 --> 2:26:31.420
 We all dream of becoming a certain kind of person, and I think we have a sense of getting

2:26:31.420 --> 2:26:34.280
 closer and not towards that person.

2:26:34.280 --> 2:26:36.400
 Maybe this is not a great metric, fine.

2:26:36.400 --> 2:26:39.680
 The other one is love, actually.

2:26:39.680 --> 2:26:45.620
 Like if you're happy or not, or you're comfortable or not, how much love do you have towards

2:26:45.620 --> 2:26:47.100
 your fellow human beings?

2:26:47.100 --> 2:26:51.540
 I feel like if you try to optimize that, and increasing that, that's going to have, that's

2:26:51.540 --> 2:26:55.720
 a good metric.

2:26:55.720 --> 2:27:00.860
 How many times a day, sorry, if I can quantify, how many times a day have you thought positively

2:27:00.860 --> 2:27:02.860
 of another human being?

2:27:02.860 --> 2:27:06.380
 Put that down as a number, and increase that number.

2:27:06.380 --> 2:27:13.660
 I think the process of saying, okay, so let's not take GDP or GDP per capita as the metric

2:27:13.660 --> 2:27:18.020
 we want to optimize for, because GDP goes up during war, and it goes up with more healthcare

2:27:18.020 --> 2:27:21.620
 spending from sicker people, and various things that we wouldn't say correlate to quality

2:27:21.620 --> 2:27:23.260
 of life.

2:27:23.260 --> 2:27:24.260
 Addiction drives GDP awesomely.

2:27:24.260 --> 2:27:28.260
 By the way, when I said growth, I wasn't referring to GDP.

2:27:28.260 --> 2:27:29.260
 I know.

2:27:29.260 --> 2:27:33.980
 I'm giving an example now of the primary metric we use, and why it's not an adequate metric,

2:27:33.980 --> 2:27:35.380
 because we're exploring other ones.

2:27:35.380 --> 2:27:41.700
 So the idea of saying, what would the metrics for a good civilization be?

2:27:41.700 --> 2:27:44.880
 If I had to pick a set of metrics, what would the best ones be if I was going to optimize

2:27:44.880 --> 2:27:46.440
 for those?

2:27:46.440 --> 2:27:51.980
 And then really try to run the thought experiment more deeply, and say, okay, so what happens

2:27:51.980 --> 2:27:54.440
 if we optimize for that?

2:27:54.440 --> 2:27:58.820
 Try to think through the first, and second, and third order effects of what happens that's

2:27:58.820 --> 2:28:03.000
 positive, and then also say, what negative things can happen from optimizing that?

2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:07.040
 What actually matters that is not included in that or in that way of defining it?

2:28:07.040 --> 2:28:11.320
 Because love versus number of positive thoughts per day, I could just make a long list of

2:28:11.320 --> 2:28:13.860
 names and just say positive thing about each one.

2:28:13.860 --> 2:28:15.780
 It's all very superficial.

2:28:15.780 --> 2:28:20.900
 Not include animals or the rest of life, have a very shallow total amount of it, but I'm

2:28:20.900 --> 2:28:24.920
 optimizing the number, and if I get some credit for the number.

2:28:24.920 --> 2:28:29.220
 And this is when I said the model of reality isn't reality.

2:28:29.220 --> 2:28:33.300
 When you make a set of metrics that we're going to optimize for this, whatever reality

2:28:33.300 --> 2:28:38.000
 is that is not included in those metrics can be the areas where harm occurs, which is why

2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:48.880
 I would say that wisdom is something like the discernment that leads to right choices

2:28:48.880 --> 2:28:53.660
 beyond what metrics based optimization would offer.

2:28:53.660 --> 2:29:03.940
 Yeah, but another way to say that is wisdom is a constantly expanding and evolving set

2:29:03.940 --> 2:29:06.260
 of metrics.

2:29:06.260 --> 2:29:10.060
 Which means that there is something in you that is recognizing a new metric that's important

2:29:10.060 --> 2:29:11.520
 that isn't part of that metric set.

2:29:11.520 --> 2:29:19.100
 So there's a certain kind of connection, discernment, awareness, and this is an iterative game theory.

2:29:19.100 --> 2:29:20.820
 There's a girdles and completeness theorem, right?

2:29:20.820 --> 2:29:24.260
 Which is if the system, if the set of things is consistent, it won't be complete.

2:29:24.260 --> 2:29:27.980
 So we're going to keep adding to it, which is why we were saying earlier, I don't think

2:29:27.980 --> 2:29:30.300
 it's not beautiful.

2:29:30.300 --> 2:29:32.740
 And especially if you were just saying one of the metrics you want to optimize for at

2:29:32.740 --> 2:29:34.580
 the individual level is becoming, right?

2:29:34.580 --> 2:29:35.580
 That we're becoming more.

2:29:35.580 --> 2:29:39.720
 Well, that then becomes true for the civilization and our metric sets as well.

2:29:39.720 --> 2:29:44.300
 And our definition of how to think about a meaningful life and a meaningful civilization.

2:29:44.300 --> 2:29:46.700
 I can tell you what some of my favorite metrics are.

2:29:46.700 --> 2:29:50.980
 What's that?

2:29:50.980 --> 2:29:52.500
 Well love is obviously not a metric.

2:29:52.500 --> 2:29:53.500
 It's like you can bench.

2:29:53.500 --> 2:29:54.500
 Yeah.

2:29:54.500 --> 2:29:55.500
 It's a good metric.

2:29:55.500 --> 2:29:56.500
 Yeah.

2:29:56.500 --> 2:30:01.400
 I want to optimize that across the entire population, starting with infants.

2:30:01.400 --> 2:30:06.860
 So in the same way that love isn't a metric, but you could make metrics that look at certain

2:30:06.860 --> 2:30:07.860
 parts of it.

2:30:07.860 --> 2:30:11.500
 The thing I'm about to say isn't a metric, but it's a, it's a consideration because I

2:30:11.500 --> 2:30:12.500
 thought about this a lot.

2:30:12.500 --> 2:30:16.260
 I don't think there is a metric, a right one.

2:30:16.260 --> 2:30:20.220
 I think that every metric by itself without this thing we talked about of the continuous

2:30:20.220 --> 2:30:22.660
 improvement becomes a paperclip maximizer.

2:30:22.660 --> 2:30:28.700
 I think that's why what the idea of false idol means in terms of the model of reality

2:30:28.700 --> 2:30:29.860
 not being reality.

2:30:29.860 --> 2:30:34.100
 Then my sacred relationship is to reality itself, which also binds me to the unknown

2:30:34.100 --> 2:30:35.100
 forever.

2:30:35.100 --> 2:30:36.500
 To the known, but also to the unknown.

2:30:36.500 --> 2:30:41.220
 And there's a sense of sacredness connected to the unknown that creates an epistemic humility

2:30:41.220 --> 2:30:45.900
 that is always seeking not just to optimize the thing I know, but to learn new stuff.

2:30:45.900 --> 2:30:47.620
 And to be open to perceive reality directly.

2:30:47.620 --> 2:30:49.020
 So my model never becomes sacred.

2:30:49.020 --> 2:30:50.020
 My model is useful.

2:30:50.020 --> 2:30:51.020
 My

2:30:51.020 --> 2:30:53.380
 So the model can't be the false idol.

2:30:53.380 --> 2:30:54.380
 Correct.

2:30:54.380 --> 2:30:55.380
 Yeah.

2:30:55.380 --> 2:30:59.060
 And this is why the first verse of the Tao Te Ching is the Tao that is nameable is not

2:30:59.060 --> 2:31:00.660
 the eternal Tao.

2:31:00.660 --> 2:31:04.140
 The naming then can become the source of the 10,000 things that if you get too carried

2:31:04.140 --> 2:31:08.540
 away with it can actually obscure you from paying attention to reality beyond in the

2:31:08.540 --> 2:31:09.540
 models.

2:31:09.540 --> 2:31:14.020
 It sounds a lot, a lot like Stephen Wolfram, but in a different language, much more poetic.

2:31:14.020 --> 2:31:15.460
 I can imagine that.

2:31:15.460 --> 2:31:20.700
 No, I'm referring, I'm joking, but there's a echoes of cellular automata, which you can't

2:31:20.700 --> 2:31:21.700
 name.

2:31:21.700 --> 2:31:24.380
 You can't construct a good model cellular automata.

2:31:24.380 --> 2:31:26.380
 You can only watch in awe.

2:31:26.380 --> 2:31:27.780
 I apologize.

2:31:27.780 --> 2:31:32.000
 I'm distracting your train of thought horribly and miserably making it different.

2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:36.900
 By the way, something robots aren't good at and dealing with the uncertainty of uneven

2:31:36.900 --> 2:31:37.900
 ground.

2:31:37.900 --> 2:31:38.900
 You've been okay so far.

2:31:38.900 --> 2:31:40.380
 You've been doing wonderfully.

2:31:40.380 --> 2:31:41.380
 So what's your favorite metrics?

2:31:41.380 --> 2:31:42.380
 Okay.

2:31:42.380 --> 2:31:43.380
 So I know you're not a robot.

2:31:43.380 --> 2:31:44.380
 So I have a

2:31:44.380 --> 2:31:50.380
 So one metric, and there are problems with this, but one metric that I like to just as

2:31:50.380 --> 2:31:56.980
 a thought experiment to consider is because you're actually asking, I mean, I know you

2:31:56.980 --> 2:32:01.340
 ask your guests about the meaning of life because ultimately when you're saying what

2:32:01.340 --> 2:32:06.560
 is a desirable civilization, you can't answer that without answering what is a meaningful

2:32:06.560 --> 2:32:11.700
 human life and to say what is a good civilization because it's going to be in relationship to

2:32:11.700 --> 2:32:17.260
 that, right?

2:32:17.260 --> 2:32:22.260
 And then you have whatever your answer is, how do you know what is the epistemic basis

2:32:22.260 --> 2:32:25.140
 for postulating that?

2:32:25.140 --> 2:32:27.540
 There's also a whole nother reason for asking that question.

2:32:27.540 --> 2:32:34.140
 I don't, I mean, that doesn't even apply to you whatsoever, which is, it's interesting

2:32:34.140 --> 2:32:41.100
 how few people have been asked questions like it.

2:32:41.100 --> 2:32:45.460
 The joke about these questions is silly, right?

2:32:45.460 --> 2:32:50.740
 It's funny to watch a person and if I was more of an asshole, I would really stick on

2:32:50.740 --> 2:32:51.740
 that question.

2:32:51.740 --> 2:32:52.740
 Right.

2:32:52.740 --> 2:32:58.420
 It's a silly question in some sense, but like we haven't really considered what it means.

2:32:58.420 --> 2:33:03.020
 Just a more concrete version of that question is what is a better world?

2:33:03.020 --> 2:33:06.340
 What is the kind of world we're trying to create really?

2:33:06.340 --> 2:33:07.340
 Have you really thought,

2:33:07.340 --> 2:33:13.140
 I'll give you some kind of simple answers to that that are meaningful to me, but let

2:33:13.140 --> 2:33:17.340
 me do the societal indices first because they're fun.

2:33:17.340 --> 2:33:20.700
 We should take a note of this meaningful thing because it's important to come back to.

2:33:20.700 --> 2:33:23.740
 Are you reminding me to ask you about the meaning of life?

2:33:23.740 --> 2:33:24.740
 Noted.

2:33:24.740 --> 2:33:28.540
 Let me jot that down.

2:33:28.540 --> 2:33:33.220
 So because I think I stopped tracking it like 25 open threads.

2:33:33.220 --> 2:33:34.220
 Okay.

2:33:34.220 --> 2:33:36.340
 Let it all burn.

2:33:36.340 --> 2:33:42.100
 One index that I find very interesting is the inverse correlation of addiction within

2:33:42.100 --> 2:33:45.260
 the society.

2:33:45.260 --> 2:33:50.540
 The more a society produces addiction within the people in it, the less healthy I think

2:33:50.540 --> 2:33:54.900
 the society is as a pretty fundamental metric.

2:33:54.900 --> 2:34:01.940
 And so the more the individuals feel that there are less compulsive things in compelling

2:34:01.940 --> 2:34:06.940
 them to behave in ways that are destructive to their own values.

2:34:06.940 --> 2:34:12.220
 And insofar as a civilization is conditioning and influencing the individuals within it,

2:34:12.220 --> 2:34:14.860
 the inverse of addiction.

2:34:14.860 --> 2:34:15.860
 Lovely defined.

2:34:15.860 --> 2:34:16.860
 Correct.

2:34:16.860 --> 2:34:17.860
 Addiction.

2:34:17.860 --> 2:34:18.860
 What's it?

2:34:18.860 --> 2:34:19.860
 Yeah.

2:34:19.860 --> 2:34:25.020
 Compulsive behavior that is destructive towards things that we value.

2:34:25.020 --> 2:34:28.180
 Yeah.

2:34:28.180 --> 2:34:29.980
 I think that's a very interesting one to think about.

2:34:29.980 --> 2:34:30.980
 That's a really interesting one.

2:34:30.980 --> 2:34:35.740
 And this is then also where comfort and addiction start to get very close.

2:34:35.740 --> 2:34:40.420
 And the ability to go in the other direction from addiction is the ability to be exposed

2:34:40.420 --> 2:34:46.540
 to hypernormal stimuli and not go down the path of desensitizing to other stimuli and

2:34:46.540 --> 2:34:51.140
 needing that hypernormal stimuli, which does involve a kind of hormesis.

2:34:51.140 --> 2:35:00.900
 So I do think the civilization of the future has to create something like ritualized discomfort.

2:35:00.900 --> 2:35:11.060
 And I think that's what the sweat lodge and the vision quest and the solo journey and

2:35:11.060 --> 2:35:13.420
 the ayahuasca journey and the Sundance were.

2:35:13.420 --> 2:35:20.400
 I think it's even a big part of what yoga asana was, is to make beings that are resilient

2:35:20.400 --> 2:35:23.140
 and strong, they have to overcome some things.

2:35:23.140 --> 2:35:27.620
 To make beings that can control their own mind and fear, they have to face some fears.

2:35:27.620 --> 2:35:31.200
 But we don't want to put everybody in war or real trauma.

2:35:31.200 --> 2:35:35.700
 And yet we can see that the most fucked up people we know had childhoods of a lot of

2:35:35.700 --> 2:35:36.700
 trauma.

2:35:36.700 --> 2:35:40.220
 But some of the most incredible people we know had childhoods of a lot of trauma, whether

2:35:40.220 --> 2:35:43.300
 or not they happened to make it through and overcome that or not.

2:35:43.300 --> 2:35:49.620
 So how do we get the benefits of the stealing of character and the resilience and the whatever

2:35:49.620 --> 2:35:52.900
 that happened from the difficulty without traumatizing people?

2:35:52.900 --> 2:36:01.680
 A certain kind of ritualized discomfort that not only has us overcome something by ourselves,

2:36:01.680 --> 2:36:05.020
 but overcome it together with each other where nobody bails when it gets hard because the

2:36:05.020 --> 2:36:06.020
 other people are there.

2:36:06.020 --> 2:36:11.340
 So it's both a resilience of the individuals and a resilience of the bonding.

2:36:11.340 --> 2:36:15.700
 So I think we'll keep getting more and more comfortable stuff, but we have to also develop

2:36:15.700 --> 2:36:21.740
 resilience in the presence of that for the anti addiction direction and the fullness

2:36:21.740 --> 2:36:24.820
 of character and the trustworthiness to others.

2:36:24.820 --> 2:36:30.660
 So you have to be consistently injecting discomfort into the system, ritualize.

2:36:30.660 --> 2:36:34.740
 I mean, this sounds like you have to imagine Sisyphus happy.

2:36:34.740 --> 2:36:45.060
 You have to imagine Sisyphus with his rock, optimally resilient from a metrics perspective

2:36:45.060 --> 2:36:47.140
 in society.

2:36:47.140 --> 2:36:52.580
 So we want to constantly be throwing rocks at ourselves.

2:36:52.580 --> 2:36:54.420
 Not constantly.

2:36:54.420 --> 2:37:00.980
 You didn't have to frequently, periodically, and there's different levels of intensity,

2:37:00.980 --> 2:37:01.980
 different periodicities.

2:37:01.980 --> 2:37:05.380
 Now, I do not think this should be imposed by states.

2:37:05.380 --> 2:37:09.040
 I think it should emerge from cultures.

2:37:09.040 --> 2:37:12.540
 And I think the cultures are developing people that understand the value of it.

2:37:12.540 --> 2:37:19.220
 So there is both a cultural cohesion to it, but there's also a voluntaryism because the

2:37:19.220 --> 2:37:22.420
 people value the thing that is being developed and understand it.

2:37:22.420 --> 2:37:28.480
 And that's what conditioning, it's conditioning some of these values.

2:37:28.480 --> 2:37:32.440
 Conditioning is a bad word because we like our idea of sovereignty, but when we recognize

2:37:32.440 --> 2:37:38.180
 the language that we speak and the words that we think in and the patterns of thought built

2:37:38.180 --> 2:37:42.440
 into that language and the aesthetics that we like and so much is conditioned in us just

2:37:42.440 --> 2:37:45.420
 based on where we're born, you can't not condition people.

2:37:45.420 --> 2:37:48.900
 So all you can do is take more responsibility for what the conditioning factors are.

2:37:48.900 --> 2:37:51.860
 And then you have to think about this question of what is a meaningful human life?

2:37:51.860 --> 2:37:55.940
 Because we're, unlike the other animals born into environment that they're genetically

2:37:55.940 --> 2:37:59.980
 adapted for, we're building new environments that we were not adapted for, and then we're

2:37:59.980 --> 2:38:02.140
 becoming affected by those.

2:38:02.140 --> 2:38:06.340
 So then we have to say, well, what kinds of environments, digital environments, physical

2:38:06.340 --> 2:38:13.100
 environments, social environments would we want to create that would develop the healthiest,

2:38:13.100 --> 2:38:16.640
 happiest, most moral, noble, meaningful people?

2:38:16.640 --> 2:38:18.280
 What are even those sets of things that matter?

2:38:18.280 --> 2:38:23.460
 So you end up getting deep existential consideration at the heart of civilization design when you

2:38:23.460 --> 2:38:27.420
 start to realize how powerful we're becoming and how much what we're building it in service

2:38:27.420 --> 2:38:28.420
 towards matters.

2:38:28.420 --> 2:38:34.960
 Before I pull it, I think three threads you just laid down, is there another metric index

2:38:34.960 --> 2:38:35.960
 that you're interested in?

2:38:35.960 --> 2:38:39.780
 There's one more that I really like.

2:38:39.780 --> 2:38:51.720
 There's a number, but the next one that comes to mind is I have to make a very quick model.

2:38:51.720 --> 2:38:58.280
 Healthy human bonding, say we were in a tribal type setting, my positive emotional states

2:38:58.280 --> 2:39:03.460
 and your positive emotional states would most of the time be correlated, your negative emotional

2:39:03.460 --> 2:39:04.860
 states and mine.

2:39:04.860 --> 2:39:10.200
 And so you start laughing, I start laughing, you start crying, my eyes might tear up.

2:39:10.200 --> 2:39:15.080
 And we would call that the compassion compersion axis.

2:39:15.080 --> 2:39:18.860
 I would, this is a model I find useful.

2:39:18.860 --> 2:39:23.000
 So compassion is when you're feeling something negative, I feel some pain, I feel some empathy,

2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:24.880
 something in relationship.

2:39:24.880 --> 2:39:27.600
 Compersion is when you do well, I'm stoked for you, right?

2:39:27.600 --> 2:39:29.640
 Like I actually feel happiness at your happiness.

2:39:29.640 --> 2:39:30.640
 I like compersion.

2:39:30.640 --> 2:39:35.800
 Yeah, the fact that it's such an uncommon word in English is actually a problem culturally.

2:39:35.800 --> 2:39:40.320
 Because I feel that often, and I think that's a really good feeling to feel and maximize

2:39:40.320 --> 2:39:41.320
 for actually.

2:39:41.320 --> 2:39:46.280
 That's actually the metric I'm going to say is the compassion compersion axis is the thing

2:39:46.280 --> 2:39:47.640
 I would optimize for.

2:39:47.640 --> 2:39:53.080
 Now, there is a state where my emotional states and your emotional states are just totally

2:39:53.080 --> 2:39:55.080
 decoupled.

2:39:55.080 --> 2:39:57.200
 And that is like sociopathy.

2:39:57.200 --> 2:40:01.520
 I don't want to hurt you, but I don't care if I do or for you to do well or whatever.

2:40:01.520 --> 2:40:06.240
 But there's a worse state and it's extremely common, which is where they're inversely coupled.

2:40:06.240 --> 2:40:11.280
 Where my positive emotions correspond to your negative ones and vice versa.

2:40:11.280 --> 2:40:17.200
 And that is the, I would call it the jealousy sadism axis.

2:40:17.200 --> 2:40:20.640
 The jealousy axis is when you're doing really well, I feel something bad.

2:40:20.640 --> 2:40:26.320
 I feel taken away from, less than, upset, envious, whatever.

2:40:26.320 --> 2:40:34.560
 And that's so common, but I think of it as kind of a low grade psychopathology that we've

2:40:34.560 --> 2:40:36.740
 just normalized.

2:40:36.740 --> 2:40:41.080
 The idea that I'm actually upset at the happiness or fulfillment or success of another is like

2:40:41.080 --> 2:40:42.920
 a profoundly fucked up thing.

2:40:42.920 --> 2:40:45.480
 No, we shouldn't shame it and repress it so it gets worse.

2:40:45.480 --> 2:40:46.560
 We should study it.

2:40:46.560 --> 2:40:47.560
 Where does it come from?

2:40:47.560 --> 2:40:50.760
 And it comes from our own insecurities and stuff.

2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:55.160
 But then the next part that everybody knows is really fucked up is just on the same axis.

2:40:55.160 --> 2:41:01.120
 It's the same inverted, which is to the jealousy or the envy is the, I feel badly when you're

2:41:01.120 --> 2:41:02.160
 doing well.

2:41:02.160 --> 2:41:06.880
 The sadism side is I actually feel good when you lose or when you're in pain, I feel some

2:41:06.880 --> 2:41:07.880
 happiness that's associated.

2:41:07.880 --> 2:41:12.280
 And you can see when someone feels jealous, sometimes they feel jealous with a partner

2:41:12.280 --> 2:41:17.540
 and then they feel they want that partner to get it, revenge comes up or something.

2:41:17.540 --> 2:41:23.160
 So sadism is really like jealousy is one step on the path to sadism from the healthy compassion

2:41:23.160 --> 2:41:24.160
 conversion axis.

2:41:24.160 --> 2:41:30.280
 So, I would like to see a society that is inversely, that is conditioning sadism and

2:41:30.280 --> 2:41:32.840
 jealousy inversely, right?

2:41:32.840 --> 2:41:36.040
 The lower that amount and the more the compassion conversion.

2:41:36.040 --> 2:41:42.240
 And if I had to summarize that very simply, I'd say it would optimize for conversion.

2:41:42.240 --> 2:41:47.840
 Which is because notice that's not just saying love for you where I might be self sacrificing

2:41:47.840 --> 2:41:52.200
 and miserable and I love people, but I kill myself, which I don't think anybody thinks

2:41:52.200 --> 2:41:53.200
 a great idea.

2:41:53.200 --> 2:41:56.400
 Happiness where I might be sociopathically happy where I'm causing problems all over

2:41:56.400 --> 2:42:00.680
 the place or even sadistically happy, but it's a coupling, right?

2:42:00.680 --> 2:42:04.840
 That I'm actually feeling happiness in relationship to yours and even in causal relationship where

2:42:04.840 --> 2:42:09.820
 I, my own agentic desire to get happier wants to support you too.

2:42:09.820 --> 2:42:13.920
 That's actually speaking of another pickup line.

2:42:13.920 --> 2:42:19.120
 That's quite honestly what I, as a guy who is single, this is going to come out very

2:42:19.120 --> 2:42:22.840
 ridiculous because it's like, oh yeah, where's your girlfriend, bro?

2:42:22.840 --> 2:42:32.040
 But that's what I look for in a relationship because it's like, it's so much, it's so,

2:42:32.040 --> 2:42:38.000
 it's such an amazing life where you actually get joy from another person's success and

2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:40.120
 they get joy from your success.

2:42:40.120 --> 2:42:45.160
 And then it becomes like you don't actually need to succeed much for that to have a, like

2:42:45.160 --> 2:42:52.380
 a loop, like a cycle of just like happiness that just increases like exponentially.

2:42:52.380 --> 2:42:53.380
 It's weird.

2:42:53.380 --> 2:42:58.160
 So like just be, just enjoying the happiness of others, the success of others.

2:42:58.160 --> 2:43:02.600
 So this, this is like the, let's call this, cause the first person that drilled this into

2:43:02.600 --> 2:43:05.000
 my head is Rogan, Joe Rogan.

2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:12.880
 He was the embodiment of that cause I saw somebody who is a successful, rich and nonstop

2:43:12.880 --> 2:43:13.880
 true.

2:43:13.880 --> 2:43:19.400
 I mean, you could tell when somebody is full of shit and somebody is not really genuinely

2:43:19.400 --> 2:43:22.320
 enjoying the success of his friends.

2:43:22.320 --> 2:43:23.320
 That was weird to me.

2:43:23.320 --> 2:43:24.320
 That was interesting.

2:43:24.320 --> 2:43:30.240
 And I mean, the way you're kind of speaking to it, the reason Joe stood out to me is I

2:43:30.240 --> 2:43:36.840
 guess I haven't witnessed genuine expression of that often in this culture of just real

2:43:36.840 --> 2:43:38.000
 joy for others.

2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:43.680
 I mean, part of that has to do, there hasn't been many channels where you can watch or

2:43:43.680 --> 2:43:46.040
 listen to people being their authentic selves.

2:43:46.040 --> 2:43:49.600
 So I'm sure there's a bunch of people who live life with compersion.

2:43:49.600 --> 2:43:56.360
 They probably don't seek public attention also, but that was, yeah, if there was any

2:43:56.360 --> 2:44:00.720
 word that could express what I've learned from Joe, why he's been a really inspiring

2:44:00.720 --> 2:44:03.000
 figure is that compersion.

2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:12.840
 And I wish our world was, had a lot more of that cause then it may, I mean, my own, sorry

2:44:12.840 --> 2:44:19.360
 to go in a small tangent, but like you're speaking how society should function.

2:44:19.360 --> 2:44:25.780
 But I feel like if you optimize for that metric in your own personal life, you're going to

2:44:25.780 --> 2:44:27.840
 live a truly fulfilling life.

2:44:27.840 --> 2:44:32.260
 I don't know what the right word to use, but that's a really good way to live life.

2:44:32.260 --> 2:44:37.880
 You will also learn what gets in the way of it and how to work with it that if you wanted

2:44:37.880 --> 2:44:42.600
 to help try to build systems at scale or apply Facebook or exponential technologies to do

2:44:42.600 --> 2:44:48.800
 that, you would have more actual depth of real knowledge of what that takes.

2:44:48.800 --> 2:44:52.360
 And this is, you know, as you mentioned that there's this virtuous cycle between when you

2:44:52.360 --> 2:44:55.640
 get stoked on other people doing well and then they have a similar relationship to you

2:44:55.640 --> 2:44:59.920
 and everyone is in the process of building each other up.

2:44:59.920 --> 2:45:05.800
 And this is what I would say the healthy version of competition is versus the unhealthy version.

2:45:05.800 --> 2:45:12.280
 The healthy version, right, the root, I believe it's a Latin word that means to strive together.

2:45:12.280 --> 2:45:16.360
 And it's that impulse of becoming where I want to become more, but I recognize that

2:45:16.360 --> 2:45:17.820
 there's actually a hormesis.

2:45:17.820 --> 2:45:21.320
 There's a challenge that is needed for me to be able to do that.

2:45:21.320 --> 2:45:24.760
 But that means that, yes, there's an impulse where I'm trying to get ahead.

2:45:24.760 --> 2:45:28.760
 Maybe I'm even trying to win, but I actually want a good opponent and I want them to get

2:45:28.760 --> 2:45:32.700
 ahead too because that is where my ongoing becoming happens and the win itself will get

2:45:32.700 --> 2:45:34.520
 boring very quickly.

2:45:34.520 --> 2:45:39.040
 The ongoing becoming is where there's aliveness and for the ongoing becoming, they need to

2:45:39.040 --> 2:45:40.040
 have it too.

2:45:40.040 --> 2:45:41.040
 And that's the strive together.

2:45:41.040 --> 2:45:44.560
 So, in the healthy competition, I'm stoked when they're doing really well because my

2:45:44.560 --> 2:45:47.200
 becoming is supported by it.

2:45:47.200 --> 2:45:55.600
 Now this is actually a very nice segue into a model I like about what a meaningful human

2:45:55.600 --> 2:46:00.120
 life is, if you want to go there.

2:46:00.120 --> 2:46:01.120
 Let's go there.

2:46:01.120 --> 2:46:08.920
 I have three things I'm going elsewhere with, but if we were first, let us take this short

2:46:08.920 --> 2:46:12.120
 stroll through the park of the meaning of life.

2:46:12.120 --> 2:46:16.280
 Daniel, what is a meaningful life?

2:46:16.280 --> 2:46:24.160
 I think the semantics end up mattering because a lot of people will take the word meaning

2:46:24.160 --> 2:46:30.240
 and the word purpose almost interchangeably and they'll think kind of, what is the meaning

2:46:30.240 --> 2:46:31.240
 of my life?

2:46:31.240 --> 2:46:32.240
 What is the meaning of human life?

2:46:32.240 --> 2:46:33.240
 What is the meaning of life?

2:46:33.240 --> 2:46:35.440
 What's the meaning of the universe?

2:46:35.440 --> 2:46:38.600
 And what is the meaning of existence rather than nonexistence?

2:46:38.600 --> 2:46:43.160
 So, there's a lot of kind of existential considerations there and I think there's some

2:46:43.160 --> 2:46:48.960
 cognitive mistakes that are very easy, like taking the idea of purpose.

2:46:48.960 --> 2:46:49.960
 Which is like a goal?

2:46:49.960 --> 2:46:51.980
 Which is a utilitarian concept.

2:46:51.980 --> 2:46:59.020
 The purpose of one thing is defined in relationship to other things that have assumed value.

2:46:59.020 --> 2:47:00.920
 And to say, what is the purpose of everything?

2:47:00.920 --> 2:47:03.480
 Well, purpose is too small of a question.

2:47:03.480 --> 2:47:05.840
 It's fundamentally a relative question within everything.

2:47:05.840 --> 2:47:07.760
 What is the purpose of one thing relative to another?

2:47:07.760 --> 2:47:08.940
 What is the purpose of everything?

2:47:08.940 --> 2:47:11.160
 And there's nothing outside of it with which to say it.

2:47:11.160 --> 2:47:16.160
 We actually just got to the limits of the utility of the concept of purpose.

2:47:16.160 --> 2:47:19.440
 It doesn't mean it's purposeless in the sense of something inside of it being purposeless.

2:47:19.440 --> 2:47:21.500
 It means the concept is too small.

2:47:21.500 --> 2:47:27.240
 Which is why you end up getting to, you know, like in Taoism, talking about the nature of

2:47:27.240 --> 2:47:28.240
 it.

2:47:28.240 --> 2:47:35.320
 Rather, there's a fundamental what where the why can't go deeper is the nature of it.

2:47:35.320 --> 2:47:40.600
 But I'm going to try to speak to a much simpler part, which is when people think about what

2:47:40.600 --> 2:47:42.740
 is a meaningful human life.

2:47:42.740 --> 2:47:48.160
 And kind of if we were to optimize for something at the level of individual life, but also,

2:47:48.160 --> 2:47:54.360
 how does optimizing for this at the level of the individual life lead to the best society

2:47:54.360 --> 2:47:59.880
 for insofar as people living that way affects others and long term, the world as a whole?

2:47:59.880 --> 2:48:05.840
 And how would we then make a civilization that was trying to think about these things?

2:48:05.840 --> 2:48:13.520
 Because you can see that there are a lot of dialectics where there's value on two sides,

2:48:13.520 --> 2:48:20.520
 individualism and collectivism or the ability to accept things and the ability to push harder

2:48:20.520 --> 2:48:22.200
 and whatever.

2:48:22.200 --> 2:48:25.820
 And there's failure modes on both sides.

2:48:25.820 --> 2:48:29.800
 And so, when you were starting to say, okay, individual happiness, you're like, wait, fuck,

2:48:29.800 --> 2:48:31.000
 sadists can be happy while hurting people.

2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:32.680
 It's not individual happiness, it's love.

2:48:32.680 --> 2:48:36.600
 But wait, some people can self sacrifice out of love in a way that actually ends up just

2:48:36.600 --> 2:48:39.200
 creating codependency for everybody.

2:48:39.200 --> 2:48:48.160
 Or okay, so how do we think about all those things together?

2:48:48.160 --> 2:48:54.480
 This kind of came to me as a simple way that I kind of relate to it is that a meaningful

2:48:54.480 --> 2:49:00.160
 life involves the mode of being, the mode of doing and the mode of becoming.

2:49:00.160 --> 2:49:07.720
 And it involves a virtuous relationship between those three and that any of those modes on

2:49:07.720 --> 2:49:12.480
 their own also have failure modes that are not a meaningful life.

2:49:12.480 --> 2:49:20.280
 The mode of being, the way I would describe it, if we're talking about the essence of

2:49:20.280 --> 2:49:25.440
 it is about taking in and appreciating the beauty of life that is now.

2:49:25.440 --> 2:49:33.040
 It's a mode that is in the moment and that is largely about being with what is.

2:49:33.040 --> 2:49:37.360
 It's fundamentally grounded in the nature of experience and the meaningfulness of experience.

2:49:37.360 --> 2:49:42.800
 The prima facie meaningfulness of when I'm having this experience, I'm not actually asking

2:49:42.800 --> 2:49:45.400
 what the meaning of life is, I'm actually full of it.

2:49:45.400 --> 2:49:46.880
 I'm full of experiencing it.

2:49:46.880 --> 2:49:49.800
 The momentary experience, the moment.

2:49:49.800 --> 2:49:50.820
 Yes.

2:49:50.820 --> 2:49:54.360
 So taking in the beauty of life.

2:49:54.360 --> 2:49:56.040
 Being is adding to the beauty of life.

2:49:56.040 --> 2:49:59.480
 I'm going to produce some art, I'm going to produce some technology that will make life

2:49:59.480 --> 2:50:01.200
 easier and more beautiful for somebody else.

2:50:01.200 --> 2:50:08.300
 I'm going to do some science that will end up leading to better insights or other people's

2:50:08.300 --> 2:50:11.680
 ability to appreciate the beauty of life more because they understand more about it or whatever

2:50:11.680 --> 2:50:13.240
 it is or protect it, right?

2:50:13.240 --> 2:50:14.680
 I'm going to protect it in some way.

2:50:14.680 --> 2:50:19.780
 But that's adding to or being in service of the beauty of life through our doing.

2:50:19.780 --> 2:50:23.000
 And becoming is getting better at both of those.

2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:26.880
 Being able to deepen our being, which is to be able to take in the beauty of life more

2:50:26.880 --> 2:50:32.680
 profoundly, be more moved by it, touched by it, and increasing our capacity with doing

2:50:32.680 --> 2:50:37.720
 to add to the beauty of life more.

2:50:37.720 --> 2:50:42.560
 So I hold that a meaningful life has to be all three of those.

2:50:42.560 --> 2:50:48.640
 And where they're not in conflict with each other, ultimately it grounds in being, it

2:50:48.640 --> 2:50:52.120
 grounds in the intrinsic meaningfulness of experience.

2:50:52.120 --> 2:50:57.440
 And then my doing is ultimately something that will be able to increase the possibility

2:50:57.440 --> 2:51:00.360
 of the quality of experience for others.

2:51:00.360 --> 2:51:03.200
 And my becoming is a deepening on those.

2:51:03.200 --> 2:51:09.000
 So it grounds an experience and also the evolutionary possibility of experience.

2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:18.080
 And the point is to oscillate between these, never getting stuck on any one or I suppose

2:51:18.080 --> 2:51:26.840
 in parallel, well you can't really, attention is a thing, you can only allocate attention.

2:51:26.840 --> 2:51:31.880
 I want moments where I am absorbed in the sunset and I'm not thinking about what to

2:51:31.880 --> 2:51:32.880
 do next.

2:51:32.880 --> 2:51:33.880
 Yeah.

2:51:33.880 --> 2:51:39.400
 And then the fullness of that can make it to where my doing doesn't come from what's

2:51:39.400 --> 2:51:45.400
 in it for me because I actually feel overwhelmingly full already.

2:51:45.400 --> 2:51:51.120
 And then it's like how can I make life better for other people that don't have as much opportunities

2:51:51.120 --> 2:51:52.120
 I had?

2:51:52.120 --> 2:51:53.560
 How can I add something wonderful?

2:51:53.560 --> 2:51:56.960
 How can I just be in the creative process?

2:51:56.960 --> 2:52:01.920
 And so I think where the doing comes from matters and if the doing comes from a fullness

2:52:01.920 --> 2:52:08.360
 of being, it's inherently going to be paying attention to externalities or it's more oriented

2:52:08.360 --> 2:52:12.200
 to do that than if it comes from some emptiness that is trying to get full in some way that

2:52:12.200 --> 2:52:15.960
 is willing to cause sacrifices other places and where a chunk of its attention is internally

2:52:15.960 --> 2:52:18.620
 focused.

2:52:18.620 --> 2:52:23.720
 And so when Buddha said desire is the cause of all suffering, then later the vow of the

2:52:23.720 --> 2:52:29.340
 Bodhisattva which was to show up for all sentient beings in universe forever is a pretty intense

2:52:29.340 --> 2:52:32.920
 thing like desire.

2:52:32.920 --> 2:52:36.160
 I would say there is a kind of desire, if we think of desire as a basis for movement

2:52:36.160 --> 2:52:39.800
 like a flow or a gradient, there's a kind of desire that comes from something missing

2:52:39.800 --> 2:52:43.160
 inside seeking fulfillment of that in the world.

2:52:43.160 --> 2:52:46.880
 That ends up being the cause of actions that perpetuate suffering.

2:52:46.880 --> 2:52:51.960
 But there's also not just non desire, there's a kind of desire that comes from feeling full

2:52:51.960 --> 2:52:57.920
 at the beauty of life and wanting to add to it that is a flow this direction.

2:52:57.920 --> 2:52:59.840
 And I don't think that is the cause of suffering.

2:52:59.840 --> 2:53:04.080
 I think that is, you know, and the Western traditions, right, the Eastern traditions

2:53:04.080 --> 2:53:08.680
 focused on that and kind of unconditional happiness outside of them, in the moment outside

2:53:08.680 --> 2:53:09.680
 of time.

2:53:09.680 --> 2:53:12.600
 The Western tradition said, no, actually, desire is the source of creativity and we're

2:53:12.600 --> 2:53:15.660
 here to be made in the image and likeness of the creator.

2:53:15.660 --> 2:53:17.760
 We're here to be fundamentally creative.

2:53:17.760 --> 2:53:21.440
 But creating from where and in service of what?

2:53:21.440 --> 2:53:24.620
 Creating from a sense of connection to everything and wholeness in service of the well being

2:53:24.620 --> 2:53:28.940
 of all of it is very different.

2:53:28.940 --> 2:53:31.440
 Which is back to that compassion, compersion axis.

2:53:31.440 --> 2:53:34.560
 Being, doing, becoming.

2:53:34.560 --> 2:53:38.000
 It's pretty powerful.

2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:50.960
 You could potentially be algorithmatized into a robot just saying, where does death come

2:53:50.960 --> 2:53:54.680
 into that?

2:53:54.680 --> 2:53:59.400
 Being is forgetting, I mean, the concept of time completely.

2:53:59.400 --> 2:54:07.120
 There's a sense to doing and becoming that has a deadline built in, the urgency built

2:54:07.120 --> 2:54:08.120
 in.

2:54:08.120 --> 2:54:16.560
 Do you think death is fundamental to this, to a meaningful life?

2:54:16.560 --> 2:54:25.360
 Acknowledging or feeling the terror of death, like Ernest Becker, or just acknowledging

2:54:25.360 --> 2:54:31.000
 the uncertainty, the mystery, the melancholy nature of the fact that the ride ends.

2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:34.560
 Is that part of this equation or it's not necessary?

2:54:34.560 --> 2:54:37.480
 Okay, look at how it could be related.

2:54:37.480 --> 2:54:40.400
 I've experienced fear of death.

2:54:40.400 --> 2:54:47.960
 I've also experienced times where I thought I was going to die that felt extremely peaceful

2:54:47.960 --> 2:54:50.040
 and beautiful.

2:54:50.040 --> 2:54:59.800
 And it's funny because we can be afraid of death because we're afraid of hell or bad

2:54:59.800 --> 2:55:03.600
 reincarnation or the bardo or some kind of idea of the afterlife we have or we're projecting

2:55:03.600 --> 2:55:05.040
 some kind of sentient suffering.

2:55:05.040 --> 2:55:12.720
 But if we're afraid of just non experience, I noticed that every time I stay up late enough

2:55:12.720 --> 2:55:18.120
 that I'm really tired, I'm longing for deep sleep and non experience, right?

2:55:18.120 --> 2:55:21.640
 Like I'm actually longing for experience to stop.

2:55:21.640 --> 2:55:26.120
 And it's not morbid, it's not a bummer.

2:55:26.120 --> 2:55:30.820
 And I don't mind falling asleep and sometimes when I wake up, I want to go back into it

2:55:30.820 --> 2:55:34.080
 and then when it's done, I'm happy to come out of it.

2:55:34.080 --> 2:55:44.840
 So when we think about death and having finite time here, and we could talk about if we live

2:55:44.840 --> 2:55:47.680
 for a thousand years instead of a hundred or something like that, it would still be

2:55:47.680 --> 2:55:49.800
 finite time.

2:55:49.800 --> 2:55:53.520
 The one bummer with the age we die is that I generally find that people mostly start

2:55:53.520 --> 2:55:58.480
 to emotionally mature just shortly before they die.

2:55:58.480 --> 2:56:15.360
 But if I get to live forever, I can just stay focused on what's in it for me forever.

2:56:15.360 --> 2:56:20.440
 And if life continues and consciousness and sentience and people appreciating beauty and

2:56:20.440 --> 2:56:25.640
 adding to it and becoming continues, my life doesn't, but my life can have effects that

2:56:25.640 --> 2:56:31.300
 continue well beyond it, then life with a capital L starts mattering more to me than

2:56:31.300 --> 2:56:32.300
 my life.

2:56:32.300 --> 2:56:35.800
 My life gets to be a part of and in service to.

2:56:35.800 --> 2:56:40.540
 And the whole thing about when old men plant trees, the shade of which they'll never get

2:56:40.540 --> 2:56:41.540
 to be in.

2:56:41.540 --> 2:56:49.640
 I remember the first time I read this poem by Hafez, the Sufi poet, written in like 13th

2:56:49.640 --> 2:56:56.000
 century or something like that, and he talked about that if you're lonely, to think about

2:56:56.000 --> 2:57:01.780
 him and he was kind of leaning his spirit into yours across the distance of a millennium

2:57:01.780 --> 2:57:06.800
 and would comfort you with these poems and just thinking about people a millennium from

2:57:06.800 --> 2:57:10.360
 now and caring about their experience and what they'd be suffering if they'd be lonely

2:57:10.360 --> 2:57:13.120
 and could he offer something that could touch them.

2:57:13.120 --> 2:57:15.340
 And it's just fucking beautiful.

2:57:15.340 --> 2:57:20.460
 And so like the most beautiful parts of humans have to do with something that transcends

2:57:20.460 --> 2:57:23.060
 what's in it for me.

2:57:23.060 --> 2:57:25.360
 And death forces you to that.

2:57:25.360 --> 2:57:34.040
 So not only does death create the urgency of doing, you're very right, it does have

2:57:34.040 --> 2:57:42.380
 a sense in which it incentivizes the compersion and the compassion.

2:57:42.380 --> 2:57:46.200
 And the widening, you remember Einstein had that quote, something to the effect of it's

2:57:46.200 --> 2:57:50.280
 an optical delusion of consciousness to believe there are separate things.

2:57:50.280 --> 2:57:56.520
 There's this one thing we call universe and something about us being inside of a prison

2:57:56.520 --> 2:58:02.520
 of perception that can only see a very narrow little bit of it.

2:58:02.520 --> 2:58:10.580
 But this might be just some weird disposition of mine, but when I think about the future

2:58:10.580 --> 2:58:18.920
 after I'm dead and I think about consciousness, I think about young people falling in love

2:58:18.920 --> 2:58:22.720
 for the first time and their experience, and I think about people being awed by sunsets

2:58:22.720 --> 2:58:27.520
 and I think about all of it, right?

2:58:27.520 --> 2:58:30.240
 I can't not feel connected to that.

2:58:30.240 --> 2:58:37.500
 Do you feel some sadness to the very high likelihood that you will be forgotten completely

2:58:37.500 --> 2:58:46.640
 by all of human history, you, Daniel, the name, that which cannot be named?

2:58:46.640 --> 2:58:52.520
 Systems like to self perpetuate, egos do that.

2:58:52.520 --> 2:58:56.800
 The idea that I might do something meaningful that future people will appreciate, of course

2:58:56.800 --> 2:59:00.640
 there's like a certain sweetness to that idea.

2:59:00.640 --> 2:59:05.480
 But I know how many people did something, did things that I wouldn't be here without

2:59:05.480 --> 2:59:09.640
 and that my life would be less without, whose names I will never know.

2:59:09.640 --> 2:59:15.460
 And I feel a gratitude to them, I feel a closeness, I feel touched by that, and I think to the

2:59:15.460 --> 2:59:22.100
 degree that the future people are conscious enough, there is a, you know, a lot of traditions

2:59:22.100 --> 2:59:26.720
 have this kind of are we being good ancestors and respect for the ancestors beyond the names.

2:59:26.720 --> 2:59:30.160
 I think that's a very healthy idea.

2:59:30.160 --> 2:59:36.520
 But let me return to a much less beautiful and a much less pleasant conversation.

2:59:36.520 --> 2:59:37.600
 You mentioned prison.

2:59:37.600 --> 2:59:41.040
 Back to X risk, okay.

2:59:41.040 --> 2:59:43.440
 And conditioning.

2:59:43.440 --> 2:59:48.200
 You mentioned something about the state.

2:59:48.200 --> 2:59:56.440
 So what role, let's talk about companies, governments, parents, all the mechanisms that

2:59:56.440 --> 2:59:58.840
 can be a source of conditioning.

2:59:58.840 --> 3:00:01.840
 Which flavor of ice cream do you like?

3:00:01.840 --> 3:00:05.680
 Do you think the state is the right thing for the future?

3:00:05.680 --> 3:00:10.200
 So governments that are elected democratic systems that are representing representative

3:00:10.200 --> 3:00:11.660
 democracy.

3:00:11.660 --> 3:00:17.920
 Is there some kind of political system of governance that you find appealing?

3:00:17.920 --> 3:00:26.000
 Is it parents, meaning a very close knit tribes of conditioning that's the most essential?

3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:34.000
 And then you and Michael Malice would happily agree that it's anarchy, or the state should

3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:42.680
 be dissolved or destroyed or burned to the ground if you're Michael Malice, giggling,

3:00:42.680 --> 3:00:46.200
 holding the torch as the fire burns.

3:00:46.200 --> 3:00:50.960
 So which which is it is the state can state be good?

3:00:50.960 --> 3:00:57.480
 Or is the state bad for the conditioning of a beautiful world, A or B?

3:00:57.480 --> 3:00:58.920
 This is like an SPT test.

3:00:58.920 --> 3:01:03.400
 You like to give these simplified good or bad things.

3:01:03.400 --> 3:01:08.520
 Would I like the state that we live in currently, the United States federal government to stop

3:01:08.520 --> 3:01:09.520
 existing today?

3:01:09.520 --> 3:01:11.560
 No, I would really not like that.

3:01:11.560 --> 3:01:16.960
 I think that would be not quite bad for the world in a lot of ways.

3:01:16.960 --> 3:01:23.520
 Do I think that it's a optimal social system and maximally just and humane and all those

3:01:23.520 --> 3:01:24.520
 things?

3:01:24.520 --> 3:01:25.520
 And I wanted to continue as is.

3:01:25.520 --> 3:01:26.520
 No, also not that.

3:01:26.520 --> 3:01:32.080
 But I am much more interested in it being able to evolve to a better thing without going

3:01:32.080 --> 3:01:38.360
 through the catastrophe phase that I think it's just non existence would give.

3:01:38.360 --> 3:01:45.720
 So what size of state is good in a sense like do we should we as a human society as this

3:01:45.720 --> 3:01:47.160
 world becomes more globalized?

3:01:47.160 --> 3:01:53.680
 Should we be constantly striving to reduce the we can we can put on a map like right

3:01:53.680 --> 3:02:02.000
 now, literally, like the the centers of power in the world, some of them are tech companies,

3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:06.840
 some of them are governments, should we be trying to as much as possible to decentralize

3:02:06.840 --> 3:02:12.640
 the power to where it's very difficult to point on the map, the centers of power.

3:02:12.640 --> 3:02:18.400
 And that means making the state however, there's a bunch of different ways to make the government

3:02:18.400 --> 3:02:28.280
 much smaller, that could be reducing in the United States, reducing the funding for the

3:02:28.280 --> 3:02:33.540
 government, all those kinds of things, their set of responsibilities, the set of powers,

3:02:33.540 --> 3:02:40.720
 it could be, I mean, this is far out, but making more nations, or maybe nations not

3:02:40.720 --> 3:02:45.800
 in the space that are defined by geographic location, but rather in the space of ideas,

3:02:45.800 --> 3:02:47.200
 which is what anarchy is about.

3:02:47.200 --> 3:02:52.760
 So anarchy is about forming collectives based on their set of ideas, and doing so dynamically

3:02:52.760 --> 3:02:56.080
 not based on where you were born, and so on.

3:02:56.080 --> 3:03:03.200
 I think we can say that the natural state of humans, if we want to describe such a thing,

3:03:03.200 --> 3:03:11.240
 is to live in tribes that were below the Dunbar number, meaning that for a few hundred thousand

3:03:11.240 --> 3:03:16.960
 years of human history, all of the groups of humans mostly stayed under that size.

3:03:16.960 --> 3:03:19.720
 And whenever it would get up to that size, it would end up cleaving.

3:03:19.720 --> 3:03:23.880
 And so it seems like there's a pretty strong, but there weren't individual humans out in

3:03:23.880 --> 3:03:25.240
 the wild doing really well, right?

3:03:25.240 --> 3:03:28.720
 So we were a group animal, but with groups that had a specific size.

3:03:28.720 --> 3:03:32.600
 So we could say, in a way, humans were being domesticated by those groups.

3:03:32.600 --> 3:03:36.000
 They were learning how to have certain rules to participate with the group, without which

3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:37.000
 you'd get kicked out.

3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:40.600
 But that's still the wild state of people.

3:03:40.600 --> 3:03:45.240
 And maybe it's useful to do as a side statement, which I've recently looked at a bunch of

3:03:45.240 --> 3:03:49.080
 papers around Dunbar's number, where the mean is actually 150.

3:03:49.080 --> 3:03:51.640
 If you actually look at the original papers, it's a range.

3:03:51.640 --> 3:03:53.240
 It's really a range.

3:03:53.240 --> 3:03:56.120
 So it's actually somewhere under a thousand.

3:03:56.120 --> 3:03:59.120
 So it's a range of like two to 500 or whatever it is.

3:03:59.120 --> 3:04:05.280
 But like you could argue that the, I think it actually is exactly two, the range is two

3:04:05.280 --> 3:04:08.440
 to 520, something like that.

3:04:08.440 --> 3:04:12.080
 And this is the mean that's taken crudely.

3:04:12.080 --> 3:04:18.840
 It's not a very good paper in terms of the actual numerically speaking.

3:04:18.840 --> 3:04:24.680
 But it'd be interesting if there's a bunch of Dunbar numbers that could be computed for

3:04:24.680 --> 3:04:26.880
 particular environments, particular conditions, so on.

3:04:26.880 --> 3:04:32.320
 It is very true that they're likely to be something small, you know, under a million.

3:04:32.320 --> 3:04:36.760
 But it'd be interesting if we can expand that number in interesting ways that will change

3:04:36.760 --> 3:04:37.760
 the fabric of this conversation.

3:04:37.760 --> 3:04:39.640
 I just want to kind of throw that in there.

3:04:39.640 --> 3:04:43.880
 I don't know if the 150 is baked in somehow into the hardware.

3:04:43.880 --> 3:04:47.120
 We can talk about some of the things that it probably has to do with.

3:04:47.120 --> 3:04:50.240
 Up to a certain number of people.

3:04:50.240 --> 3:04:53.960
 And this is going to be variable based on the social technologies that mediate it to

3:04:53.960 --> 3:04:54.960
 some degree.

3:04:54.960 --> 3:04:59.680
 We'll talk about that in a minute.

3:04:59.680 --> 3:05:04.360
 Up to a certain number of people, everybody can know everybody else pretty intimately.

3:05:04.360 --> 3:05:12.320
 So let's go ahead and just take 150 as an average number.

3:05:12.320 --> 3:05:18.860
 Everybody can know everyone intimately enough that if your actions made anyone else do poorly,

3:05:18.860 --> 3:05:22.640
 it's your extended family and you're stuck living with them and you know who they are

3:05:22.640 --> 3:05:24.360
 and there's no anonymous people.

3:05:24.360 --> 3:05:27.200
 There's no just them and over there.

3:05:27.200 --> 3:05:32.400
 And that's one part of what leads to a kind of tribal process where it's good for the

3:05:32.400 --> 3:05:35.300
 individual and good for the whole has a coupling.

3:05:35.300 --> 3:05:41.040
 Also below that scale, everyone is somewhat aware of what everybody else is doing.

3:05:41.040 --> 3:05:44.560
 There's not groups that are very siloed.

3:05:44.560 --> 3:05:47.960
 And as a result, it's actually very hard to get away with bad behavior.

3:05:47.960 --> 3:05:50.840
 There's a force kind of transparency.

3:05:50.840 --> 3:05:55.720
 And so you don't need kind of like the state in that way.

3:05:55.720 --> 3:05:58.600
 But lying to people doesn't actually get you ahead.

3:05:58.600 --> 3:06:01.600
 Sociopathic behavior doesn't get you ahead because it gets seen.

3:06:01.600 --> 3:06:06.760
 And so there's a conditioning environment where the individual is behaving in a way

3:06:06.760 --> 3:06:11.440
 that is aligned with the interest of the tribe is what gets conditioned.

3:06:11.440 --> 3:06:16.920
 When it gets to be a much larger system, it becomes easier to hide certain things from

3:06:16.920 --> 3:06:22.800
 the group as a whole as well as to be less emotionally bound to a bunch of anonymous people.

3:06:22.800 --> 3:06:29.440
 I would say there's also a communication protocol where up to about that number of people, we

3:06:29.440 --> 3:06:33.320
 could all sit around a tribal council and be part of a conversation around a really

3:06:33.320 --> 3:06:34.320
 big decision.

3:06:34.320 --> 3:06:35.320
 Do we migrate?

3:06:35.320 --> 3:06:36.320
 Do we not migrate?

3:06:36.320 --> 3:06:37.320
 Do we, you know, something like that?

3:06:37.320 --> 3:06:39.080
 Do we get rid of this person?

3:06:39.080 --> 3:06:47.160
 And why would I want to agree to be a part of a larger group where everyone can't be

3:06:47.160 --> 3:06:49.160
 part of that council?

3:06:49.160 --> 3:06:54.520
 And so I am going to now be subject to law that I have no say in if I could be part of

3:06:54.520 --> 3:06:58.120
 a smaller group that could still survive and I get a say in the law that I'm subject to.

3:06:58.120 --> 3:07:03.040
 So I think the cleaving and a way we can look at it beyond the Dunbar number two is we can

3:07:03.040 --> 3:07:08.140
 look at that a civilization has binding energy that is holding them together and has cleaving

3:07:08.140 --> 3:07:09.140
 energy.

3:07:09.140 --> 3:07:12.960
 And if the binding energy exceeds the cleaving energy, that civilization will last.

3:07:12.960 --> 3:07:16.560
 And so there are things that we can do to decrease the cleaving energy within the society,

3:07:16.560 --> 3:07:18.200
 things we can do to increase the binding energy.

3:07:18.200 --> 3:07:22.060
 I think naturally we saw that had certain characteristics up to a certain size kind

3:07:22.060 --> 3:07:24.440
 of tribalism.

3:07:24.440 --> 3:07:25.800
 That ended with a few things.

3:07:25.800 --> 3:07:31.460
 It ended with people having migrated enough that when you started to get resource wars,

3:07:31.460 --> 3:07:33.360
 you couldn't just migrate away easily.

3:07:33.360 --> 3:07:35.120
 And so tribal warfare became more obligated.

3:07:35.120 --> 3:07:39.600
 It involved the plow and the beginning of real economic surplus.

3:07:39.600 --> 3:07:45.640
 So there were a few different kind of forcing functions.

3:07:45.640 --> 3:07:48.440
 But we're talking about what size should it be, right?

3:07:48.440 --> 3:07:50.000
 What size should a society be?

3:07:50.000 --> 3:07:55.720
 And I think the idea, like if we think about your body for a moment as a self organizing

3:07:55.720 --> 3:07:58.800
 complex system that is multi scaled, we think about...

3:07:58.800 --> 3:08:00.400
 Our body is a wonderland.

3:08:00.400 --> 3:08:04.720
 Our body is a wonderland, yeah.

3:08:04.720 --> 3:08:06.560
 That's a John Mayer song.

3:08:06.560 --> 3:08:07.560
 I apologize.

3:08:07.560 --> 3:08:12.040
 But yes, so if we think about our body and the billions of cells that are in it.

3:08:12.040 --> 3:08:14.040
 Well, you don't have...

3:08:14.040 --> 3:08:18.320
 Think about how ridiculous it would be to try to have all the tens of trillions of cells

3:08:18.320 --> 3:08:21.880
 in it with no internal organization structure, right?

3:08:21.880 --> 3:08:24.200
 Just like a sea of protoplasm.

3:08:24.200 --> 3:08:25.200
 It wouldn't work.

3:08:25.200 --> 3:08:26.200
 Pure democracy.

3:08:26.200 --> 3:08:31.800
 And so you have cells and tissues, and then you have tissues and organs and organs and

3:08:31.800 --> 3:08:36.280
 organ systems, and so you have these layers of organization, and then obviously the individual

3:08:36.280 --> 3:08:39.720
 in a tribe in a ecosystem.

3:08:39.720 --> 3:08:44.400
 And each of the higher layers are both based on the lower layers, but also influencing

3:08:44.400 --> 3:08:45.400
 them.

3:08:45.400 --> 3:08:49.800
 I think the future of civilization will be similar, which is there's a level of governance

3:08:49.800 --> 3:08:51.480
 that happens at the level of the individual.

3:08:51.480 --> 3:08:54.600
 My own governance of my own choice.

3:08:54.600 --> 3:08:57.800
 I think there's a level that happens at the level of a family.

3:08:57.800 --> 3:09:01.000
 We're making decisions together, we're inter influencing each other and affecting each

3:09:01.000 --> 3:09:05.120
 other, taking responsibility for the idea of an extended family.

3:09:05.120 --> 3:09:08.160
 And you can see that like for a lot of human history, we had an extended family, we had

3:09:08.160 --> 3:09:13.520
 a local community, a local church or whatever it was, we had these intermediate structures.

3:09:13.520 --> 3:09:20.000
 Whereas right now, there's kind of like the individual producer, consumer, taxpayer, voter,

3:09:20.000 --> 3:09:24.280
 and the massive nation state global complex, and not that much in the way of intermediate

3:09:24.280 --> 3:09:28.040
 structures that we relate with, and not that much in the way of real personal dynamics,

3:09:28.040 --> 3:09:31.520
 all impersonalized, made fungible.

3:09:31.520 --> 3:09:39.040
 And so, I think that we have to have global governance, meaning I think we have to have

3:09:39.040 --> 3:09:43.280
 governance at the scale we affect stuff, and if anybody is messing up the oceans, that

3:09:43.280 --> 3:09:44.280
 matters for everybody.

3:09:44.280 --> 3:09:48.240
 So, that can't only be national or only local.

3:09:48.240 --> 3:09:51.820
 Everyone is scared of the idea of global governance because we think about some top down system

3:09:51.820 --> 3:09:54.960
 of imposition that now has no checks and balances on power.

3:09:54.960 --> 3:10:00.080
 I'm scared of that same version, so I'm not talking about that kind of global governance.

3:10:00.080 --> 3:10:03.680
 It's why I'm even using the word governance as a process rather than government as an

3:10:03.680 --> 3:10:07.600
 imposed phenomena.

3:10:07.600 --> 3:10:11.560
 And so, I think we have to have global governance, but I think we also have to have local governance,

3:10:11.560 --> 3:10:16.280
 and there has to be relationships between them that each, where there are both checks

3:10:16.280 --> 3:10:18.760
 and balances and power flows of information.

3:10:18.760 --> 3:10:24.840
 So, I think governance at the level of cities will be a bigger deal in the future than governance

3:10:24.840 --> 3:10:30.320
 at the level of nation states because I think nation states are largely fictitious things

3:10:30.320 --> 3:10:34.280
 that are defined by wars and agreements to stop wars and like that.

3:10:34.280 --> 3:10:38.400
 I think cities are based on real things that will keep being real where the proximity of

3:10:38.400 --> 3:10:43.280
 certain things together, the physical proximity of things together gives increased value of

3:10:43.280 --> 3:10:44.280
 those things.

3:10:44.280 --> 3:10:50.360
 So, you look at like Jeffrey West's work on scale and finding that companies and nation

3:10:50.360 --> 3:10:54.440
 states and things that have a kind of complicated agreement structure get diminishing return

3:10:54.440 --> 3:10:58.920
 of, of production per capita as the total number of people increases beyond about the

3:10:58.920 --> 3:10:59.920
 tribal scale.

3:10:59.920 --> 3:11:04.280
 But the city actually gets increasing productivity per capita, but it's not designed, it's kind

3:11:04.280 --> 3:11:06.160
 of this organic thing, right?

3:11:06.160 --> 3:11:10.320
 So, there should be governance at the level of cities because people can sense and actually

3:11:10.320 --> 3:11:15.040
 have some agency there, probably neighborhoods and smaller scales within it and also verticals

3:11:15.040 --> 3:11:17.840
 and some of it won't be geographic, it'll be network based, right?

3:11:17.840 --> 3:11:18.840
 Networks of affinities.

3:11:18.840 --> 3:11:21.760
 So, I don't think the future is one type of governance.

3:11:21.760 --> 3:11:26.520
 Now, what we can say more broadly is say, when we're talking about groups of people

3:11:26.520 --> 3:11:30.380
 that inner affect each other, the idea of a civilization is that we can figure out how

3:11:30.380 --> 3:11:35.520
 to coordinate our choice making to not be at war with each other and hopefully increase

3:11:35.520 --> 3:11:40.440
 total productive capacity in a way that's good for everybody, division of labor and

3:11:40.440 --> 3:11:44.880
 specialty so we all get more better stuff and whatever.

3:11:44.880 --> 3:11:49.800
 But it's a, it's a coordination of our choice making.

3:11:49.800 --> 3:11:55.240
 I think we can look at civilizations failing on the side of not having enough coordination

3:11:55.240 --> 3:11:58.720
 of choice making, so they fail on the side of chaos and then they cleave and an internal

3:11:58.720 --> 3:12:04.720
 war comes about or whatever, or they can't make smart decisions and they overuse their

3:12:04.720 --> 3:12:07.060
 resources or whatever.

3:12:07.060 --> 3:12:14.400
 Or it can fail on the side of trying to get order via imposition, via force, and so it

3:12:14.400 --> 3:12:20.480
 fails on the side of oppression, which ends up being for a while functionalish for the

3:12:20.480 --> 3:12:25.140
 thing as a whole, but miserable for most people in it until it fails either because of revolt

3:12:25.140 --> 3:12:28.260
 or because it can't innovate enough or something like that.

3:12:28.260 --> 3:12:34.340
 And so, there's this like toggling between order via oppression and chaos.

3:12:34.340 --> 3:12:39.560
 And I think the idea of democracy, not the way we've implemented it, but the idea of

3:12:39.560 --> 3:12:43.840
 it, whether we're talking about a representative democracy or a direct digital democracy, liquid

3:12:43.840 --> 3:12:50.280
 democracy, a republic or whatever, the idea of an open society, participatory governance

3:12:50.280 --> 3:12:56.380
 is can we have order that is emergent rather than imposed so that we aren't stuck with

3:12:56.380 --> 3:13:04.040
 chaos and infighting and inability to coordinate, and we're also not stuck with oppression?

3:13:04.040 --> 3:13:08.620
 And what would it take to have emergent order?

3:13:08.620 --> 3:13:16.520
 This is the most kind of central question for me these days because if we look at what

3:13:16.520 --> 3:13:20.660
 different nation states are doing around the world and we see nation states that are more

3:13:20.660 --> 3:13:26.500
 authoritarian that in some ways are actually coordinating much more effectively.

3:13:26.500 --> 3:13:32.700
 So for instance, we can see that China has built high speed rail not just through its

3:13:32.700 --> 3:13:36.820
 country but around the world and the US hasn't built any high speed rail yet.

3:13:36.820 --> 3:13:41.400
 You can see that it brought 300 million people out of poverty in a time where we've had increasing

3:13:41.400 --> 3:13:43.920
 economic inequality happening.

3:13:43.920 --> 3:13:49.260
 You can see like that if there was a single country that could make all of its own stuff

3:13:49.260 --> 3:13:53.420
 if the global supply chains failed, China would be the closest one to being able to

3:13:53.420 --> 3:13:57.700
 start to go closed loop on fundamental things.

3:13:57.700 --> 3:14:03.840
 Belt and Road Initiative, supply chain on rare earth metals, transistor manufacturing

3:14:03.840 --> 3:14:08.840
 that is like, oh, they're actually coordinating more effectively in some important ways.

3:14:08.840 --> 3:14:12.020
 In the last call it 30 years.

3:14:12.020 --> 3:14:14.680
 And that's imposed order.

3:14:14.680 --> 3:14:16.160
 Imposed order.

3:14:16.160 --> 3:14:24.680
 And we can see that if in the US, let's look at why real quick.

3:14:24.680 --> 3:14:29.040
 We know why we created term limits so that we wouldn't have forever monarchs.

3:14:29.040 --> 3:14:32.320
 That's the thing we were trying to get away from and that there would be checks and balances

3:14:32.320 --> 3:14:34.480
 on power and that kind of thing.

3:14:34.480 --> 3:14:38.560
 But that also has created a negative second order effect, which is nobody does long term

3:14:38.560 --> 3:14:43.200
 planning because somebody comes in who's got four years, they want reelected.

3:14:43.200 --> 3:14:46.440
 They don't do anything that doesn't create a return within four years that will end up

3:14:46.440 --> 3:14:48.880
 getting them elected, reelected.

3:14:48.880 --> 3:14:53.780
 And so the 30 year industrial development to build high speed trains or the new kind

3:14:53.780 --> 3:14:57.040
 of fusion energy or whatever it is just doesn't get invested in.

3:14:57.040 --> 3:15:02.840
 And then if you have left versus right, where whatever someone does for four years, then

3:15:02.840 --> 3:15:05.880
 the other guy gets in and undoes it for four years.

3:15:05.880 --> 3:15:08.520
 And most of the energy goes into campaigning against each other.

3:15:08.520 --> 3:15:11.220
 This system is just dissipating as heat, right?

3:15:11.220 --> 3:15:12.800
 Like it's just burning up as heat.

3:15:12.800 --> 3:15:16.540
 And the system that has no term limits and no internal friction in fighting because they

3:15:16.540 --> 3:15:20.040
 got rid of those people can actually coordinate better.

3:15:20.040 --> 3:15:27.400
 But I would argue it has its own fail states eventually and dystopic properties that are

3:15:27.400 --> 3:15:28.400
 not the thing we want.

3:15:28.400 --> 3:15:34.080
 So the goal is to accomplish, to create a system that does long term planning without

3:15:34.080 --> 3:15:45.360
 the negative effects of a monarch or dictator that stays there for the long term and accomplish

3:15:45.360 --> 3:15:54.200
 that through not doing the imposition of a single leader, but through emergence.

3:15:54.200 --> 3:16:03.040
 So that perhaps, first of all, the technology in itself seems to maybe disagree a lot for

3:16:03.040 --> 3:16:08.420
 different possibilities here, which is make primary the system, not the humans.

3:16:08.420 --> 3:16:21.760
 So the basic, the medium on which the democracy happens, like a platform where people can

3:16:21.760 --> 3:16:29.800
 make decisions, do the choice making, the coordination of the choice making, where emerges

3:16:29.800 --> 3:16:34.080
 some kind of order to where like something that applies at the scale of the family, the

3:16:34.080 --> 3:16:43.400
 family, the city, the country, the continent, the whole world, and then does that so dynamically,

3:16:43.400 --> 3:16:48.440
 constantly changing based on the needs of the people, sort of always evolving.

3:16:48.440 --> 3:16:54.960
 And it would all be owned by Google.

3:16:54.960 --> 3:17:00.720
 Is there a way to, so first of all, you're optimistic that you could basically create

3:17:00.720 --> 3:17:06.560
 the technology can save us technology at creating platforms by technology, I mean, like software

3:17:06.560 --> 3:17:14.680
 network platforms that allows humans to deliberate, like make government together dynamically

3:17:14.680 --> 3:17:19.440
 without the need for a leader that's on a podium screaming stuff.

3:17:19.440 --> 3:17:21.240
 That's one and two.

3:17:21.240 --> 3:17:27.680
 If you're optimistic about that, are you also optimistic about the CEOs of such platforms?

3:17:27.680 --> 3:17:36.080
 The idea that technology is values neutral, values agnostic, and people can use it for

3:17:36.080 --> 3:17:40.240
 constructive or destructive purposes, but it doesn't predispose anything.

3:17:40.240 --> 3:17:44.080
 It's just silly and naive.

3:17:44.080 --> 3:17:49.260
 Technology elicits patterns of human behavior because those who utilize it and get ahead

3:17:49.260 --> 3:17:53.680
 end up behaving differently because of their utilization of it, and then other people,

3:17:53.680 --> 3:17:57.620
 then they end up shaping the world or other people race to also get the power of the technology

3:17:57.620 --> 3:18:02.720
 and so there's whole schools of anthropology that look at the effect on social systems

3:18:02.720 --> 3:18:06.040
 and the minds of people of the change in our tooling.

3:18:06.040 --> 3:18:09.920
 Marvin Harris's work called cultural materialism looked at this deeply, obviously Marshall

3:18:09.920 --> 3:18:13.400
 McLuhan looked specifically at the way that information technologies change the nature

3:18:13.400 --> 3:18:19.120
 of our beliefs, minds, values, social systems.

3:18:19.120 --> 3:18:23.800
 I will not try to do this rigorously because there are academics will disagree on the subtle

3:18:23.800 --> 3:18:27.840
 details but I'll do it kind of like illustratively.

3:18:27.840 --> 3:18:31.560
 You think about the emergence of the plow, the ox drawn plow in the beginning of agriculture

3:18:31.560 --> 3:18:36.160
 that came with it where before that you had hunter gatherer and then you had horticulture

3:18:36.160 --> 3:18:40.320
 kind of a digging stick but not the plow.

3:18:40.320 --> 3:18:43.720
 Well the world changed a lot with that, right?

3:18:43.720 --> 3:18:54.200
 And a few of the changes that at least some theorists believe in is when the ox drawn

3:18:54.200 --> 3:18:57.840
 plow started to proliferate, any culture that utilized it was able to start to actually

3:18:57.840 --> 3:19:01.080
 cultivate grain because just with a digging stick you couldn't get enough grain for it

3:19:01.080 --> 3:19:04.520
 to matter, grain was a storable caloric surplus, they could make it through the famines, they

3:19:04.520 --> 3:19:08.400
 could grow their population, so the ones that used it got so much ahead that it became obligate

3:19:08.400 --> 3:19:14.440
 and everybody used it, that corresponding with the use of a plow, animism went away

3:19:14.440 --> 3:19:18.720
 everywhere that it existed because you can't talk about the spirit of the buffalo while

3:19:18.720 --> 3:19:23.840
 beating the cow all day long to pull the plow, so the moment that we do animal husbandry

3:19:23.840 --> 3:19:27.440
 of that kind where you have to beat the cow all day, you have to say it's just a dumb

3:19:27.440 --> 3:19:30.640
 animal, man has dominion over earth and the nature of even our religious and spiritual

3:19:30.640 --> 3:19:31.880
 ideas change.

3:19:31.880 --> 3:19:37.080
 You went from women primarily using the digging stick to do the horticulture or gathering

3:19:37.080 --> 3:19:40.920
 before that, men doing the hunting stuff to now men had to use the plow because the upper

3:19:40.920 --> 3:19:44.000
 body strength actually really mattered, women would have miscarriages when they would do

3:19:44.000 --> 3:19:48.160
 it when they were pregnant, so all the caloric supply started to come from men where it had

3:19:48.160 --> 3:19:52.880
 been from both before and the ratio of male female gods changed to being mostly male gods

3:19:52.880 --> 3:19:54.920
 following that.

3:19:54.920 --> 3:20:01.800
 Obviously we went from very, that particular line of thought then also says that feminism

3:20:01.800 --> 3:20:09.880
 followed the tractor and that the rise of feminism in the West started to follow women

3:20:09.880 --> 3:20:15.440
 being able to say we can do what men can because the male upper body strength wasn't differential

3:20:15.440 --> 3:20:20.760
 once the internal combustion engine was much stronger and we can drive a tractor.

3:20:20.760 --> 3:20:26.160
 So I don't think to try to trace complex things to one cause is a good idea, so I think this

3:20:26.160 --> 3:20:33.080
 is a reductionist view but it has truth in it and so the idea that technology is values

3:20:33.080 --> 3:20:35.040
 agnostic is silly.

3:20:35.040 --> 3:20:39.160
 Technology codes patterns of behavior that code rationalizing those patterns of behavior

3:20:39.160 --> 3:20:40.560
 and believing in them.

3:20:40.560 --> 3:20:44.640
 The plow also is the beginning of the Anthropocene, right, it was the beginning of us changing

3:20:44.640 --> 3:20:49.340
 the environment radically to clear cut areas to just make them useful for people which

3:20:49.340 --> 3:20:54.180
 also meant the change of the view of where the web of life were just a part of it, etc.

3:20:54.180 --> 3:20:57.360
 So all those types of things.

3:20:57.360 --> 3:21:02.480
 That's brilliantly put, by the way, that was just brilliant.

3:21:02.480 --> 3:21:05.960
 But the question is, so it's not agnostic, but...

3:21:05.960 --> 3:21:10.480
 So we have to look at what the psychological effects of specific tech applied certain ways

3:21:10.480 --> 3:21:17.280
 are and be able to say it's not just doing the first order thing you intended, it's doing

3:21:17.280 --> 3:21:23.200
 like the effect on patriarchy and animism and the end of tribal culture in the beginning

3:21:23.200 --> 3:21:26.000
 of empire and the class systems that came with that.

3:21:26.000 --> 3:21:28.720
 We can go on and on about what the plow did.

3:21:28.720 --> 3:21:32.320
 The beginning of surplus was inheritance, which then became the capital model and like

3:21:32.320 --> 3:21:34.580
 lots of things.

3:21:34.580 --> 3:21:39.820
 So we have to say when we're looking at the tech, what are the values built into the way

3:21:39.820 --> 3:21:42.200
 the tech is being built that are not obvious?

3:21:42.200 --> 3:21:44.480
 Right, so you always have to consider externalities.

3:21:44.480 --> 3:21:45.480
 Yes.

3:21:45.480 --> 3:21:48.560
 And the externalities are not just physical to the environment, they're also to how the

3:21:48.560 --> 3:21:51.880
 people are being conditioned and how the relationality between them is being conditioned.

3:21:51.880 --> 3:21:56.740
 So the question I'm asking you, so I personally would rather be led by a plow and a tractor

3:21:56.740 --> 3:21:58.880
 than Stalin, okay?

3:21:58.880 --> 3:22:02.640
 That's the question I'm asking you.

3:22:02.640 --> 3:22:09.400
 In creating an emergent government where people, where there's a democracy that's dynamic,

3:22:09.400 --> 3:22:19.520
 that makes choices, that does governance at like a very kind of liquid, there's a bunch

3:22:19.520 --> 3:22:26.540
 of fine resolution layers of abstraction of governance happening at all scales, right?

3:22:26.540 --> 3:22:32.080
 And doing so dynamically where no one person has power at any one time that can dominate

3:22:32.080 --> 3:22:34.320
 and impose rule, okay?

3:22:34.320 --> 3:22:35.480
 That's the Stalin version.

3:22:35.480 --> 3:22:48.040
 I'm saying isn't the alternative that's emergent empowered or made possible by the plow and

3:22:48.040 --> 3:22:54.100
 the tractor, which is the modern version of that, is like the internet, the digital space

3:22:54.100 --> 3:23:00.040
 where we can, the monetary system where you have the currency and so on, but you have

3:23:00.040 --> 3:23:03.840
 much more importantly, to me at least, is just basic social interaction, the mechanisms

3:23:03.840 --> 3:23:08.240
 of human transacting with each other in the space of ideas, isn't?

3:23:08.240 --> 3:23:12.240
 So yes, it's not agnostic, definitely not agnostic.

3:23:12.240 --> 3:23:14.320
 You've had a brilliant rant there.

3:23:14.320 --> 3:23:20.280
 The tractor has effects, but isn't that the way we achieve an emergent system of governance?

3:23:20.280 --> 3:23:26.720
 Yes, but I wouldn't say we're on track.

3:23:26.720 --> 3:23:28.160
 You haven't seen anything promising.

3:23:28.160 --> 3:23:32.720
 It's not that I haven't seen anything promising, it's that to be on track requires understanding

3:23:32.720 --> 3:23:36.720
 and guiding some of the things differently than is currently happening and it's possible.

3:23:36.720 --> 3:23:38.800
 That's actually what I really care about.

3:23:38.800 --> 3:23:46.520
 So you couldn't have had a Stalin without having certain technologies emerge.

3:23:46.520 --> 3:23:51.040
 He couldn't have ruled such a big area without transportation technologies, without the train,

3:23:51.040 --> 3:23:55.200
 without the communication tech that made it possible.

3:23:55.200 --> 3:24:00.280
 So when you say you'd rather have a tractor or a plow than a Stalin, there's a relationship

3:24:00.280 --> 3:24:08.640
 between them that is more recursive, which is new physical technologies allow rulers

3:24:08.640 --> 3:24:14.120
 to rule with more power over larger distances historically.

3:24:14.120 --> 3:24:19.520
 And some things are more responsible for that than others.

3:24:19.520 --> 3:24:23.860
 Like Stalin also ate stuff for breakfast, but the thing he ate for breakfast is less

3:24:23.860 --> 3:24:28.220
 responsible for the starvation of millions than the train.

3:24:28.220 --> 3:24:32.480
 The train is more responsible for that and then the weapons of war are more responsible.

3:24:32.480 --> 3:24:38.120
 So some technology, let's not throw it all in the, you're saying like technology has

3:24:38.120 --> 3:24:42.040
 a responsibility here, but some is better than others.

3:24:42.040 --> 3:24:46.280
 I'm saying that people's use of technology will change their behavior.

3:24:46.280 --> 3:24:48.880
 So it has behavioral dispositions built in.

3:24:48.880 --> 3:24:52.160
 The change of the behavior will also change the values in the society.

3:24:52.160 --> 3:24:53.480
 It's very complicated, right?

3:24:53.480 --> 3:24:58.580
 It will also, as a result, both make people who have different kinds of predispositions

3:24:58.580 --> 3:25:03.420
 with regard to rulership and different kinds of new capacities.

3:25:03.420 --> 3:25:06.440
 And so we have to think about these things.

3:25:06.440 --> 3:25:12.080
 It's kind of well understood that the printing press and then in early industrialism ended

3:25:12.080 --> 3:25:15.800
 feudalism and created kind of nation states.

3:25:15.800 --> 3:25:22.240
 So one thing I would say as a long trend that we can look at is that whenever there is a

3:25:22.240 --> 3:25:27.560
 step function, a major leap in technology, physical technology, the underlying techno

3:25:27.560 --> 3:25:33.080
 industrial base with which we do stuff, it ends up coding for, it ends up predisposing

3:25:33.080 --> 3:25:38.640
 a whole bunch of human behavioral patterns that the previous social system had not emerged

3:25:38.640 --> 3:25:40.560
 to try to solve.

3:25:40.560 --> 3:25:44.400
 And so it usually ends up breaking the previous social systems, the way the plow broke the

3:25:44.400 --> 3:25:48.360
 tribal system, the way that the industrial revolution broke the feudal system, and then

3:25:48.360 --> 3:25:54.200
 new social systems have to emerge so they can deal with the new powers, the new dispositions,

3:25:54.200 --> 3:25:55.200
 whatever with that tech.

3:25:55.200 --> 3:26:00.360
 Obviously, the nuke broke nation state governance being adequate and said, we can't ever have

3:26:00.360 --> 3:26:01.360
 that again.

3:26:01.360 --> 3:26:06.800
 So then it created this international governance apparatus world.

3:26:06.800 --> 3:26:21.600
 So I guess what I'm saying is that the solution is not exponential tech following the current

3:26:21.600 --> 3:26:26.400
 path of what the market incentivizes exponential tech to do, market being a previous social

3:26:26.400 --> 3:26:28.160
 tech.

3:26:28.160 --> 3:26:38.760
 I would say that exponential tech, if we look at different types of social tech, so let's

3:26:38.760 --> 3:26:46.680
 just briefly look at that democracy tried to do the emergent order thing, right?

3:26:46.680 --> 3:26:56.360
 At least that's the story, and which is, and this is why if you look, this important part

3:26:56.360 --> 3:26:57.360
 to build first.

3:26:57.360 --> 3:26:58.360
 It's kind of doing it.

3:26:58.360 --> 3:26:59.360
 It's just doing it poorly.

3:26:59.360 --> 3:27:03.120
 You're saying, I mean, that's, it is emergent order in some sense.

3:27:03.120 --> 3:27:06.200
 I mean, that's the hope of democracy versus other forms of government.

3:27:06.200 --> 3:27:07.200
 Correct.

3:27:07.200 --> 3:27:11.260
 I mean, I said at least the story because obviously it didn't do it for women and slaves

3:27:11.260 --> 3:27:12.260
 early on.

3:27:12.260 --> 3:27:14.560
 It doesn't do it for all classes equally, et cetera.

3:27:14.560 --> 3:27:20.720
 But the idea of democracy is that, is participatory governance.

3:27:20.720 --> 3:27:26.160
 And so you notice that the modern democracies emerged out of the European enlightenment

3:27:26.160 --> 3:27:31.240
 and specifically because the idea that a lot of people, some huge number, not a tribal

3:27:31.240 --> 3:27:34.560
 number, a huge number of anonymous people who don't know each other, are not bonded

3:27:34.560 --> 3:27:38.680
 to each other, who believe different things, who grew up in different ways, can all work

3:27:38.680 --> 3:27:42.560
 together to make collective decisions, well, that affect everybody, and where some of them

3:27:42.560 --> 3:27:46.560
 will make compromises and the thing that matters to them for what matters to other strangers.

3:27:46.560 --> 3:27:47.560
 That's actually wild.

3:27:47.560 --> 3:27:50.820
 Like it's a wild idea that that would even be possible.

3:27:50.820 --> 3:27:57.400
 And it was kind of the result of this high enlightenment idea that we could all do the

3:27:57.400 --> 3:28:03.000
 philosophy of science and we could all do the Hegelian dialectic.

3:28:03.000 --> 3:28:04.400
 Those ideas had emerged, right?

3:28:04.400 --> 3:28:11.400
 And it was that we could all, so our choice making, because we said a society is trying

3:28:11.400 --> 3:28:15.520
 to coordinate choice making, the emergent order is the order of the choices that we're

3:28:15.520 --> 3:28:18.960
 making, not just at the level of the individuals, but what groups of individuals, corporations,

3:28:18.960 --> 3:28:21.560
 nations, states, whatever do.

3:28:21.560 --> 3:28:25.440
 Our choices are based on, our choice making is based on our sense making and our meaning

3:28:25.440 --> 3:28:26.440
 making.

3:28:26.440 --> 3:28:30.040
 Our sense making is what do we believe is happening in the world, and what do we believe

3:28:30.040 --> 3:28:31.620
 the effects of a particular thing would be.

3:28:31.620 --> 3:28:34.620
 Our meaning making is what do we care about, right, our values generation, what do we care

3:28:34.620 --> 3:28:37.280
 about that we're trying to move the world in the direction of.

3:28:37.280 --> 3:28:41.560
 If you ultimately are trying to move the world in a direction that is really, really different

3:28:41.560 --> 3:28:44.920
 than the direction I'm trying to, we have very different values, we're gonna have a

3:28:44.920 --> 3:28:46.140
 hard time.

3:28:46.140 --> 3:28:51.160
 And if you think the world is a very different world, right, if you think that systemic racism

3:28:51.160 --> 3:28:56.040
 is rampant everywhere and one of the worst problems, and I think it's not even a thing,

3:28:56.040 --> 3:29:00.440
 if you think climate change is almost existential, and I think it's not even a thing, we're gonna

3:29:00.440 --> 3:29:02.800
 have a really hard time coordinating.

3:29:02.800 --> 3:29:07.220
 And so, we have to be able to have shared sense making of can we come to understand

3:29:07.220 --> 3:29:12.920
 just what is happening together, and then can we do shared values generation, okay?

3:29:12.920 --> 3:29:17.360
 Maybe I'm emphasizing a particular value more than you, but I can take your perspective

3:29:17.360 --> 3:29:21.520
 and I can see how the thing that you value is worth valuing, and I can see how it's affected

3:29:21.520 --> 3:29:22.520
 by this thing.

3:29:22.520 --> 3:29:25.980
 So, can we take all the values and try to come up with a proposition that benefits all

3:29:25.980 --> 3:29:30.020
 of them better than the proposition I created just to benefit these ones that harms the

3:29:30.020 --> 3:29:34.380
 ones that you care about, which is why you're opposing my proposition?

3:29:34.380 --> 3:29:39.400
 We don't even try in the process of crafting a proposition currently to see, and this is

3:29:39.400 --> 3:29:43.480
 the reason that the proposition we vote on, it gets half the votes almost all the time.

3:29:43.480 --> 3:29:47.580
 It almost never gets 90% of the votes, is because it benefits some things and harms

3:29:47.580 --> 3:29:48.580
 other things.

3:29:48.580 --> 3:29:52.640
 We can say all theory of trade offs, but we didn't even try to say, could we see what

3:29:52.640 --> 3:29:55.840
 everybody cares about and see if there is a better solution?

3:29:55.840 --> 3:29:56.840
 So...

3:29:56.840 --> 3:29:57.840
 How do we fix that try?

3:29:57.840 --> 3:30:01.960
 I wonder, is it as simple as the social technology of education?

3:30:01.960 --> 3:30:02.960
 Yes.

3:30:02.960 --> 3:30:03.960
 Well, no.

3:30:03.960 --> 3:30:10.320
 I mean, the proposition crafting and refinement process has to be key to a democracy or participatory

3:30:10.320 --> 3:30:11.960
 governance, and it's not currently.

3:30:11.960 --> 3:30:16.920
 But isn't that the humans creating that situation?

3:30:16.920 --> 3:30:20.120
 So one way, there's two ways to fix that.

3:30:20.120 --> 3:30:24.200
 One is to fix the individual humans, which is the education early in life, and the second

3:30:24.200 --> 3:30:26.240
 is to create somehow systems that...

3:30:26.240 --> 3:30:28.120
 Yeah, it's both.

3:30:28.120 --> 3:30:33.820
 So I understand the education part, but creating systems, that's why I mentioned the technologies

3:30:33.820 --> 3:30:36.240
 is creating social networks, essentially.

3:30:36.240 --> 3:30:37.560
 Yes, that's actually necessary.

3:30:37.560 --> 3:30:42.000
 Okay, so let's go to the first part and then we'll come to the second part.

3:30:42.000 --> 3:30:49.120
 So democracy emerged as an enlightenment era idea that we could all do a dialectic and

3:30:49.120 --> 3:30:55.160
 come to understand what other people valued, and so that we could actually come up with

3:30:55.160 --> 3:31:00.520
 a cooperative solution rather than just, fuck you, we're gonna get our thing in war, right?

3:31:00.520 --> 3:31:01.520
 And that we could sense make together.

3:31:01.520 --> 3:31:05.160
 We could all apply the philosophy of science and you weren't gonna stick to your guns on

3:31:05.160 --> 3:31:08.360
 what the speed of sound is if we measured it and we found out what it was, and there's

3:31:08.360 --> 3:31:12.040
 a unifying element to the objectivity in that way.

3:31:12.040 --> 3:31:17.240
 And so this is why I believe Jefferson said, if you could give me a perfect newspaper and

3:31:17.240 --> 3:31:21.000
 a broken government, or in paraphrasing, a broken government and perfect newspaper, I

3:31:21.000 --> 3:31:22.640
 wouldn't hesitate to take the perfect newspaper.

3:31:22.640 --> 3:31:26.000
 Because if the people understand what's going on, they can build a new government.

3:31:26.000 --> 3:31:30.080
 If they don't understand what's going on, they can't possibly make good choices.

3:31:30.080 --> 3:31:36.200
 And Washington, I'm paraphrasing again, first president said the number one aim of the federal

3:31:36.200 --> 3:31:41.400
 government should be the comprehensive education of every citizen and the science of government.

3:31:41.400 --> 3:31:42.820
 Science of government was the term of art.

3:31:42.820 --> 3:31:44.020
 Think about what that means, right?

3:31:44.020 --> 3:31:49.640
 Science of government would be game theory, coordination theory, history, wouldn't call

3:31:49.640 --> 3:31:53.660
 game theory yet, history, sociology, economics, right?

3:31:53.660 --> 3:31:57.320
 All the things that lead to how we understand human coordination.

3:31:57.320 --> 3:32:02.040
 I think it's so profound that he didn't say the number one aim of the federal government

3:32:02.040 --> 3:32:04.360
 is rule of law.

3:32:04.360 --> 3:32:07.400
 And he didn't say it's protecting the border from enemies.

3:32:07.400 --> 3:32:11.560
 Because if the number one aim was to protect the border from enemies, it could do that

3:32:11.560 --> 3:32:14.560
 as a military dictatorship quite effectively.

3:32:14.560 --> 3:32:21.000
 And if the goal was rule of law, it could do it as a dictatorship, as a police state.

3:32:21.000 --> 3:32:24.840
 And so if the number one goal is anything other than the comprehensive education of

3:32:24.840 --> 3:32:28.300
 all the citizens and the science of government, it won't stay democracy long.

3:32:28.300 --> 3:32:33.080
 You can see, so both education and the fourth estate, the fourth estate being the...

3:32:33.080 --> 3:32:34.760
 So education, can I make sense of the world?

3:32:34.760 --> 3:32:36.080
 Am I trained to make sense of the world?

3:32:36.080 --> 3:32:38.700
 The fourth estate is what's actually going on currently, the news.

3:32:38.700 --> 3:32:41.440
 Do I have good, unbiased information about it?

3:32:41.440 --> 3:32:46.620
 Those are both considered prerequisite institutions for democracy to even be a possibility.

3:32:46.620 --> 3:32:51.760
 And then at the scale it was initially suggested here, the town hall was the key phenomena

3:32:51.760 --> 3:32:55.920
 where there wasn't a special interest group crafted a proposition, and the first thing

3:32:55.920 --> 3:32:59.640
 I ever saw was the proposition, didn't know anything about it, and I got to vote yes or

3:32:59.640 --> 3:33:00.640
 no.

3:33:00.640 --> 3:33:03.600
 It was in the town hall, we all got to talk about it, and the proposition could get crafted

3:33:03.600 --> 3:33:08.340
 in real time through the conversation, which is why there was that founding fathers statement

3:33:08.340 --> 3:33:11.100
 that voting is the death of democracy.

3:33:11.100 --> 3:33:16.180
 Voting fundamentally is polarizing the population in some kind of sublimated war.

3:33:16.180 --> 3:33:19.480
 And we'll do that as the last step, but what we wanna do first is to say, how does the

3:33:19.480 --> 3:33:23.920
 thing that you care about that seems damaged by this proposition, how could that turn into

3:33:23.920 --> 3:33:26.080
 a solution to make this proposition better?

3:33:26.080 --> 3:33:29.120
 Where this proposition still tends to the thing it's trying to tend to and tends to

3:33:29.120 --> 3:33:30.120
 that better.

3:33:30.120 --> 3:33:31.120
 Can we work on this together?

3:33:31.120 --> 3:33:33.000
 And in a town hall, we could have that.

3:33:33.000 --> 3:33:35.720
 As the scale increased, we lost the ability to do that.

3:33:35.720 --> 3:33:38.000
 Now, as you mentioned, the internet could change that.

3:33:38.000 --> 3:33:41.800
 The fact that we had representatives that had to ride a horse from one town hall to

3:33:41.800 --> 3:33:47.800
 the other one to see what the colony would do, that we stopped having this kind of developmental

3:33:47.800 --> 3:33:52.000
 propositional development process when the town hall ended.

3:33:52.000 --> 3:33:58.480
 The fact that we have not used the internet to recreate this is somewhere between insane

3:33:58.480 --> 3:34:03.920
 and aligned with class interests.

3:34:03.920 --> 3:34:08.920
 I would push back to say that the internet has those things, it just has a lot of other

3:34:08.920 --> 3:34:09.920
 things.

3:34:09.920 --> 3:34:16.040
 I feel like the internet has places where that encourage synthesis of competing ideas

3:34:16.040 --> 3:34:19.960
 and sense making, which is what we're talking about.

3:34:19.960 --> 3:34:24.840
 It's just that it's also flooded with a bunch of other systems that perhaps are out competing

3:34:24.840 --> 3:34:29.040
 it under current incentives, perhaps has to do with capitalism in the market.

3:34:29.040 --> 3:34:30.040
 Sure.

3:34:30.040 --> 3:34:32.040
 Linux is awesome, right?

3:34:32.040 --> 3:34:36.320
 And Wikipedia and places where you have, and they have problems, but places where you have

3:34:36.320 --> 3:34:41.760
 open source sharing of information, vetting of information towards collective building.

3:34:41.760 --> 3:34:48.040
 Is that building something like, how much has that affected our court systems or our

3:34:48.040 --> 3:34:50.600
 policing systems or our military systems or our?

3:34:50.600 --> 3:34:53.640
 First of all, I think a lot, but not enough.

3:34:53.640 --> 3:34:59.360
 I think this is something I told you offline yesterday as a, perhaps as a whole nother

3:34:59.360 --> 3:35:05.360
 discussion, but I don't think we're quite quantifying the impact on the world, the positive

3:35:05.360 --> 3:35:08.000
 impact of Wikipedia.

3:35:08.000 --> 3:35:16.880
 You said the policing, I mean, I just, I just think the amount of empathy that like knowledge

3:35:16.880 --> 3:35:25.480
 I think can't help, but lead to empathy, just knowing, okay.

3:35:25.480 --> 3:35:26.480
 Just knowing.

3:35:26.480 --> 3:35:27.480
 Okay.

3:35:27.480 --> 3:35:30.900
 I'll give you some pieces of information, knowing how many people died in various wars

3:35:30.900 --> 3:35:35.940
 that already that Delta, when you have millions of people have that knowledge, it's like,

3:35:35.940 --> 3:35:41.680
 it's a little like slap in the face, like, Oh, like my boyfriend or girlfriend breaking

3:35:41.680 --> 3:35:47.480
 up with me is not such a big deal when millions of people were tortured, you know, like just

3:35:47.480 --> 3:35:48.480
 a little bit.

3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:54.160
 And when a lot of people know that because of Wikipedia, uh, or the effect, their second

3:35:54.160 --> 3:35:58.880
 order effects of Wikipedia, which is it's not that necessarily people read Wikipedia.

3:35:58.880 --> 3:36:07.040
 It's like YouTubers who don't really know stuff that well will thoroughly read a Wikipedia

3:36:07.040 --> 3:36:11.740
 article and create a compelling video describing that Wikipedia article that then millions

3:36:11.740 --> 3:36:14.640
 of people watch and they understand that.

3:36:14.640 --> 3:36:15.640
 Holy shit.

3:36:15.640 --> 3:36:18.560
 A lot of, there was such, first of all, there was such a thing as world war II and world

3:36:18.560 --> 3:36:19.560
 war I.

3:36:19.560 --> 3:36:20.560
 Okay.

3:36:20.560 --> 3:36:22.720
 Like they can at least like learn about it.

3:36:22.720 --> 3:36:25.520
 They can learn about this was like recent.

3:36:25.520 --> 3:36:26.560
 They can learn about slavery.

3:36:26.560 --> 3:36:30.220
 They can learn about all kinds of injustices in the world.

3:36:30.220 --> 3:36:36.880
 And that I think has a lot of effects to our, to the way, whether you're a police officer,

3:36:36.880 --> 3:36:46.320
 a lawyer, a judge in the jury, or just the regular civilian citizen, the way you approach

3:36:46.320 --> 3:36:52.040
 the every other communication you engage in, even if the system of that communication is

3:36:52.040 --> 3:36:53.040
 very much flawed.

3:36:53.040 --> 3:36:56.000
 So I think there's a huge positive effect on Wikipedia.

3:36:56.000 --> 3:36:57.000
 That's my case for Wikipedia.

3:36:57.000 --> 3:36:58.800
 So you should donate to Wikipedia.

3:36:58.800 --> 3:37:04.840
 I mean, I'm a huge fan, but there's very few systems like it, which is sad to me.

3:37:04.840 --> 3:37:14.040
 So I think it's, it would be a useful exercise for any, uh, listener of the show to really

3:37:14.040 --> 3:37:21.640
 try to run the dialectical synthesis process with regard to a topic like this and take

3:37:21.640 --> 3:37:29.840
 the, um, techno concerned perspective with regard to, uh, information tech that folks

3:37:29.840 --> 3:37:35.960
 like Tristan Harris take and say, what are all of the things that are getting worse and

3:37:35.960 --> 3:37:39.920
 what, and are any of them following an exponential curve and how much worse, how quickly could

3:37:39.920 --> 3:37:42.680
 that be?

3:37:42.680 --> 3:37:48.600
 And then, and do that fully without mitigating it, then take the techno optimist perspective

3:37:48.600 --> 3:37:53.660
 and see what things are getting better in a way that Kurzweil or Diamandis or someone

3:37:53.660 --> 3:37:59.460
 might do and try to take that perspective fully and say, are some of those things exponential?

3:37:59.460 --> 3:38:00.460
 What could that portend?

3:38:00.460 --> 3:38:03.700
 And then try to hold all that at the same time.

3:38:03.700 --> 3:38:10.780
 And I think there are ways in which, depending upon the metrics we're looking at, things

3:38:10.780 --> 3:38:15.120
 are getting worse on exponential curves and better on exponential curves for different

3:38:15.120 --> 3:38:20.920
 metrics at the same time, which I hold as the destabilization of previous system and

3:38:20.920 --> 3:38:27.380
 either an emergence to a better system or collapse to a lower order are both possible.

3:38:27.380 --> 3:38:32.100
 And so I want my optimism not to be about my assessment.

3:38:32.100 --> 3:38:35.360
 I want my assessment to be just as fucking clear as it can be.

3:38:35.360 --> 3:38:41.240
 I want my optimism to be what inspires the solution process on that clear assessment.

3:38:41.240 --> 3:38:45.680
 So I never want to apply optimism in the sense making.

3:38:45.680 --> 3:38:47.600
 I want to just try to be clear.

3:38:47.600 --> 3:38:52.640
 If anything, I want to make sure that the challenges are really well understood.

3:38:52.640 --> 3:38:57.880
 But that's in service of an optimism that there are good potentials, even if I don't

3:38:57.880 --> 3:39:02.240
 know what they are, that are worth seeking.

3:39:02.240 --> 3:39:07.580
 There is some sense of optimism that's required to even try to innovate really hard problems.

3:39:07.580 --> 3:39:12.400
 But then I want to take my pessimism and red team my own optimism to see, is that solution

3:39:12.400 --> 3:39:13.400
 not going to work?

3:39:13.400 --> 3:39:14.680
 Does it have second order effects?

3:39:14.680 --> 3:39:19.660
 And then not get upset by that because I then come back to how to make it better.

3:39:19.660 --> 3:39:24.320
 So just a relationship between optimism and pessimism and the dialectic of how they can

3:39:24.320 --> 3:39:25.320
 work.

3:39:25.320 --> 3:39:32.600
 So when I, of course, we can say that Wikipedia is a pretty awesome example of a thing.

3:39:32.600 --> 3:39:40.080
 We can look at the places where it has limits or has failed, where on a celebrity topic

3:39:40.080 --> 3:39:45.760
 or corporate interest topic, you can pay Wikipedia editors to edit more frequently and various

3:39:45.760 --> 3:39:46.760
 things like that.

3:39:46.760 --> 3:39:51.320
 But you can also see where there's a lot of information that was kind of decentrally created

3:39:51.320 --> 3:39:54.760
 that is good information that is more easily accessible to people than everybody buying

3:39:54.760 --> 3:39:58.700
 their own encyclopedia Britannica or walking down to the library and that can be updated

3:39:58.700 --> 3:40:01.560
 in real time faster.

3:40:01.560 --> 3:40:09.480
 And I think you're very right that the business model is a big difference because Wikipedia

3:40:09.480 --> 3:40:11.520
 is not a for profit corporation.

3:40:11.520 --> 3:40:17.100
 It is a – it's tending to the information commons and it doesn't have an agenda other

3:40:17.100 --> 3:40:19.960
 than tending to the information commons.

3:40:19.960 --> 3:40:25.760
 And I think the two masters issue is a tricky one when I'm trying to optimize for very different

3:40:25.760 --> 3:40:32.560
 kinds of things where I have to sacrifice one for the other and I can't find synergistic

3:40:32.560 --> 3:40:33.560
 satisfiers.

3:40:33.560 --> 3:40:34.560
 Which one?

3:40:34.560 --> 3:40:40.440
 And if I have a fiduciary responsibility to shareholder profit maximization and, you know,

3:40:40.440 --> 3:40:43.400
 what does that end up creating?

3:40:43.400 --> 3:40:50.320
 I think the ad model that Silicon Valley took, I think Jaron Laney or I don't know if you've

3:40:50.320 --> 3:40:56.400
 had him on the show, but he has an interesting assessment of the nature of the ad model.

3:40:56.400 --> 3:41:03.120
 Silicon Valley wanting to support capitalism and entrepreneurs to make things but also

3:41:03.120 --> 3:41:07.700
 the belief that information should be free and also the network dynamics where the more

3:41:07.700 --> 3:41:12.320
 people you got on, you got increased value per user, per capita as more people got on

3:41:12.320 --> 3:41:15.480
 so you didn't want to do anything to slow the rate of adoption.

3:41:15.480 --> 3:41:20.520
 Some places actually, you know, PayPal paying people money to join the network because the

3:41:20.520 --> 3:41:24.360
 value of the network would be, there'd be a Metcalf like dynamic proportional to the

3:41:24.360 --> 3:41:26.720
 square of the total number of users.

3:41:26.720 --> 3:41:33.080
 So the ad model made sense of how do we make it free but also be a business, get everybody

3:41:33.080 --> 3:41:38.720
 on but not really thinking about what it would mean to – and this is now the whole idea

3:41:38.720 --> 3:41:44.200
 that if you aren't paying for the product, you are the product.

3:41:44.200 --> 3:41:47.760
 If they have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholder to maximize profit, their

3:41:47.760 --> 3:41:54.440
 customer is the advertiser, the user who it's being built for is to do behavioral mod for

3:41:54.440 --> 3:42:00.280
 them for advertisers, that's a whole different thing than that same type of tech could have

3:42:00.280 --> 3:42:05.760
 been if applied with a different business model or different purpose.

3:42:05.760 --> 3:42:14.640
 I think because Facebook and Google and other information and communication platforms end

3:42:14.640 --> 3:42:19.600
 up harvesting data about user behavior that allows them to model who the people are in

3:42:19.600 --> 3:42:27.680
 a way that gives them more sometimes specific information and behavioral information than

3:42:27.680 --> 3:42:31.840
 even a therapist or a doctor or a lawyer or a priest might have in a different setting,

3:42:31.840 --> 3:42:35.160
 they basically are accessing privileged information.

3:42:35.160 --> 3:42:38.280
 There should be a fiduciary responsibility.

3:42:38.280 --> 3:42:45.720
 And in normal fiduciary law, if there's this principal agent thing, if you are a principal

3:42:45.720 --> 3:42:49.600
 and I'm an agent on your behalf, I don't have a game theoretic relationship with you.

3:42:49.600 --> 3:42:53.040
 If you're sharing something with me and I'm the priest or I'm the therapist, I'm never

3:42:53.040 --> 3:42:58.400
 going to use that information to try to sell you a used car or whatever the thing is.

3:42:58.400 --> 3:43:03.040
 But Facebook is gathering massive amounts of privileged information and using it to

3:43:03.040 --> 3:43:07.000
 modify people's behavior for a behavior that they didn't sign up for wanting the behavior

3:43:07.000 --> 3:43:08.720
 but what the corporation did.

3:43:08.720 --> 3:43:14.720
 So I think this is an example of the physical tech evolving in the context of the previous

3:43:14.720 --> 3:43:18.520
 social tech where it's being shaped in particular ways.

3:43:18.520 --> 3:43:25.040
 And here, unlike Wikipedia that evolved for the information commons, this evolved for

3:43:25.040 --> 3:43:26.880
 fulfilling particular agentic purpose.

3:43:26.880 --> 3:43:29.600
 Most people when they're on Facebook think it's just a tool that they're using.

3:43:29.600 --> 3:43:31.160
 They don't realize it's an agent, right?

3:43:31.160 --> 3:43:37.160
 It is a corporation with a profit motive and as I'm interacting with it, it has a goal

3:43:37.160 --> 3:43:40.080
 for me different than my goal for myself.

3:43:40.080 --> 3:43:41.760
 And I might want to be on for a short period of time.

3:43:41.760 --> 3:43:43.760
 Its goal is maximize time on site.

3:43:43.760 --> 3:43:49.920
 And so there is a rivalry where there should be a fiduciary contract.

3:43:49.920 --> 3:43:52.680
 I think that's actually a huge deal.

3:43:52.680 --> 3:44:05.520
 And I think if we said, could we apply Facebook like technology to develop people's citizenry

3:44:05.520 --> 3:44:06.520
 capacity, right?

3:44:06.520 --> 3:44:13.320
 To develop their personal health and wellbeing and habits as well as their cognitive understanding,

3:44:13.320 --> 3:44:20.240
 the complexity with which they can process the health of their relationships, that would

3:44:20.240 --> 3:44:22.320
 be amazing to start to explore.

3:44:22.320 --> 3:44:28.480
 And this is now the thesis that we started to discuss before is every time there is a

3:44:28.480 --> 3:44:33.920
 major step function in the physical tech, it obsoletes the previous social tech and

3:44:33.920 --> 3:44:36.880
 the new social tech has to emerge.

3:44:36.880 --> 3:44:41.600
 What I would say is that when we look at the nation state level of the world today, the

3:44:41.600 --> 3:44:47.160
 more top down authoritarian nation states are as the exponential tech started to emerge,

3:44:47.160 --> 3:44:52.480
 the digital technology started to emerge, they were in a position for better long term

3:44:52.480 --> 3:44:55.480
 planning and better coordination.

3:44:55.480 --> 3:44:59.480
 And so the authoritarian states started applying the exponential tech intentionally to make

3:44:59.480 --> 3:45:01.940
 more effective authoritarian states.

3:45:01.940 --> 3:45:07.320
 And that's everything from like an internet of things surveillance system going into machine

3:45:07.320 --> 3:45:11.760
 learning systems to the Sesame credit system to all those types of things.

3:45:11.760 --> 3:45:16.360
 And so they're upgrading their social tech using the exponential tech.

3:45:16.360 --> 3:45:23.760
 Otherwise within a nation state like the US, but democratic open societies, the countries,

3:45:23.760 --> 3:45:28.240
 the states are not directing the technology in a way that makes a better open society,

3:45:28.240 --> 3:45:30.160
 meaning better emergent order.

3:45:30.160 --> 3:45:34.320
 They're saying, well, the corporations are doing that and the state is doing the relatively

3:45:34.320 --> 3:45:37.960
 little thing it would do aligned with the previous corporate law that no longer is relevant

3:45:37.960 --> 3:45:40.560
 because there wasn't fiduciary responsibility for things like that.

3:45:40.560 --> 3:45:45.640
 There wasn't antitrust because this creates functional monopolies because of network dynamics,

3:45:45.640 --> 3:45:46.640
 right?

3:45:46.640 --> 3:45:50.640
 Where YouTube has more users than Vimeo and every other video player together.

3:45:50.640 --> 3:45:54.640
 Amazon has a bigger percentage of market share than all of the other markets together.

3:45:54.640 --> 3:46:00.120
 You get one big dog per vertical because of network effect, which is a kind of organic

3:46:00.120 --> 3:46:05.120
 monopoly that the previous antitrust law didn't even have a place, that wasn't a thing.

3:46:05.120 --> 3:46:11.600
 Antimonopoly was only something that emerged in the space of government contracts.

3:46:11.600 --> 3:46:15.920
 So what we see is that the new exponential technology is being directed by authoritarian

3:46:15.920 --> 3:46:19.280
 nation states to make better authoritarian nation states and by corporations to make

3:46:19.280 --> 3:46:21.720
 more powerful corporations.

3:46:21.720 --> 3:46:25.440
 Powerful corporations, when we think about the Scottish enlightenment, when the idea

3:46:25.440 --> 3:46:31.520
 of markets was being advanced, the modern kind of ideas of markets, the biggest corporation

3:46:31.520 --> 3:46:35.040
 was tiny compared to what the biggest corporation today is.

3:46:35.040 --> 3:46:39.080
 So the asymmetry of it relative to people was tiny.

3:46:39.080 --> 3:46:43.640
 And the asymmetry now in terms of the total technology it employs, total amount of money,

3:46:43.640 --> 3:46:48.920
 total amount of information processing is so many orders of magnitude.

3:46:48.920 --> 3:46:55.800
 And rather than there be demand for an authentic thing that creates a basis for supply, as

3:46:55.800 --> 3:46:59.760
 supply started to get way more coordinated and powerful and the demand wasn't coordinated

3:46:59.760 --> 3:47:03.120
 because you don't have a labor union of all the customers working together, but you do

3:47:03.120 --> 3:47:05.160
 have a coordination on the supply side.

3:47:05.160 --> 3:47:08.040
 Supply started to recognize that it could manufacture demand.

3:47:08.040 --> 3:47:10.880
 It could make people want shit that they didn't want before that maybe wouldn't increase their

3:47:10.880 --> 3:47:14.400
 happiness in a meaningful way, might increase addiction.

3:47:14.400 --> 3:47:17.600
 Addiction is a very good way to manufacture demand.

3:47:17.600 --> 3:47:23.640
 And so as soon as manufactured demand started through this is the cool thing and you have

3:47:23.640 --> 3:47:28.860
 to have it for status or whatever it is, the intelligence of the market was breaking.

3:47:28.860 --> 3:47:32.960
 Now it's no longer a collective intelligence system that is up regulating real desire for

3:47:32.960 --> 3:47:34.280
 things that are really meaningful.

3:47:34.280 --> 3:47:38.160
 We were able to hijack the lower angels of our nature rather than the higher ones.

3:47:38.160 --> 3:47:42.040
 The addictive patterns drive those and have people want shit that doesn't actually make

3:47:42.040 --> 3:47:44.340
 them happy or make the world better.

3:47:44.340 --> 3:47:51.100
 And so we really also have to update our theory of markets because behavioral econ showed

3:47:51.100 --> 3:47:55.960
 that homo economicus, the rational actor is not really a thing, but particularly at greater

3:47:55.960 --> 3:47:58.560
 and greater scale can't really be a thing.

3:47:58.560 --> 3:48:02.840
 Voluntaryism isn't a thing where if my company doesn't want to advertise on Facebook, I just

3:48:02.840 --> 3:48:06.600
 will lose to the companies that do because that's where all the fucking attention is.

3:48:06.600 --> 3:48:12.040
 And so then I can say it's voluntary, but it's not really if there's a functional monopoly.

3:48:12.040 --> 3:48:14.760
 Same if I'm going to sell on Amazon or things like that.

3:48:14.760 --> 3:48:21.760
 So what I would say is these corporations are becoming more powerful than nation states

3:48:21.760 --> 3:48:24.080
 in some ways.

3:48:24.080 --> 3:48:34.000
 And they are also debasing the integrity of the nation states, the open societies.

3:48:34.000 --> 3:48:38.840
 So the democracies are getting weaker as a result of exponential tech and the kind of

3:48:38.840 --> 3:48:43.640
 new tech companies that are kind of a new feudalism, tech feudalism, because it's not

3:48:43.640 --> 3:48:48.400
 a democracy inside of a tech company or the supply and demand relationship when you have

3:48:48.400 --> 3:48:53.200
 manufactured demand and kind of monopoly type functions.

3:48:53.200 --> 3:48:57.280
 And so we have basically a new feudalism controlling exponential tech and authoritarian nation

3:48:57.280 --> 3:48:58.280
 states controlling it.

3:48:58.280 --> 3:49:01.120
 And those attractors are both shitty.

3:49:01.120 --> 3:49:07.200
 And so I'm interested in the application of exponential tech to making better social tech

3:49:07.200 --> 3:49:13.280
 that makes emergent order possible and where then that emergent order can bind and direct

3:49:13.280 --> 3:49:19.080
 the exponential tech in fundamentally healthy, not X risk oriented directions.

3:49:19.080 --> 3:49:22.680
 I think the relationship of social tech and physical tech can make it.

3:49:22.680 --> 3:49:26.600
 I think we can actually use the physical tech to make better social tech, but it's not given

3:49:26.600 --> 3:49:27.940
 that we do.

3:49:27.940 --> 3:49:32.020
 If we don't make better social tech, then I think the physical tech empowers really

3:49:32.020 --> 3:49:35.040
 shitty social tech that is not a world that we want.

3:49:35.040 --> 3:49:39.520
 I don't know if it's a road we want to go down, but I tend to believe that the market

3:49:39.520 --> 3:49:43.600
 will create exactly the thing you're talking about, which I feel like there's a lot of

3:49:43.600 --> 3:49:55.160
 money to be made in creating a social tech that creates a better citizen, that creates

3:49:55.160 --> 3:50:00.640
 a better human being.

3:50:00.640 --> 3:50:05.740
 Your description of Facebook and so on, which is a system that creates addiction, which

3:50:05.740 --> 3:50:14.600
 manufactures demand, is not obviously inherently the consequence of the markets.

3:50:14.600 --> 3:50:19.200
 I feel like that's the first stage of us, like baby deer trying to figure out how to

3:50:19.200 --> 3:50:20.560
 use the internet.

3:50:20.560 --> 3:50:28.360
 I feel like there's much more money to be made with something that creates compersion

3:50:28.360 --> 3:50:29.360
 and love.

3:50:29.360 --> 3:50:30.360
 Honestly.

3:50:30.360 --> 3:50:35.360
 I mean, I really, we can have this, I can make the business case for it.

3:50:35.360 --> 3:50:39.840
 I don't know if, I don't think we want to really have that discussion, but do you have

3:50:39.840 --> 3:50:41.920
 some hope that that's the case?

3:50:41.920 --> 3:50:47.160
 I guess if not, then how do we fix the system of markets that worked so well for the United

3:50:47.160 --> 3:50:49.120
 States for so long?

3:50:49.120 --> 3:50:51.520
 Like I said, every social tech worked for a while.

3:50:51.520 --> 3:50:55.440
 Like tribalism worked well for two or 300,000 years.

3:50:55.440 --> 3:50:58.000
 I think social tech has to keep evolving.

3:50:58.000 --> 3:51:03.360
 The social technologies with which we organize and coordinate our behavior have to keep evolving

3:51:03.360 --> 3:51:05.860
 as our physical tech does.

3:51:05.860 --> 3:51:12.960
 So I think the thing that we call markets, of course we can try to say, oh, even biology

3:51:12.960 --> 3:51:15.000
 runs on markets.

3:51:15.000 --> 3:51:22.160
 But the thing that we call markets, the underlying theory, homo economicus, demand, driving supply,

3:51:22.160 --> 3:51:23.700
 that thing broke.

3:51:23.700 --> 3:51:28.320
 It broke with scale in particular and a few other things.

3:51:28.320 --> 3:51:32.640
 So it needs updated in a really fundamental way.

3:51:32.640 --> 3:51:37.840
 I think there's something even deeper than making money happening that in some ways will

3:51:37.840 --> 3:51:41.680
 obsolete money making.

3:51:41.680 --> 3:51:46.560
 I think capitalism is not about business.

3:51:46.560 --> 3:51:50.520
 So if you think about business, I'm going to produce a good or a service that people

3:51:50.520 --> 3:51:55.420
 want and bring it to the market so that people get access to that good or service.

3:51:55.420 --> 3:51:58.840
 That's the world of business, but that's not capitalism.

3:51:58.840 --> 3:52:05.680
 Capitalism is the management and allocation of capital, which financial services was a

3:52:05.680 --> 3:52:09.080
 tiny percentage of the total market has become a huge percentage of the total market.

3:52:09.080 --> 3:52:10.440
 It's a different creature.

3:52:10.440 --> 3:52:14.760
 So if I was in business and I was producing a good or service and I was saving up enough

3:52:14.760 --> 3:52:19.340
 money that I started to be able to invest that money and gain interest or do things

3:52:19.340 --> 3:52:24.620
 like that, I start realizing I'm making more money on my money than I'm making on producing

3:52:24.620 --> 3:52:26.160
 the goods and services.

3:52:26.160 --> 3:52:29.960
 So I stop even paying attention to goods and services and start paying attention to making

3:52:29.960 --> 3:52:34.380
 money on money and how do I utilize capital to create more capital.

3:52:34.380 --> 3:52:37.880
 And capital gives me more optionality because I can buy anything with it than a particular

3:52:37.880 --> 3:52:42.880
 good or service that only some people want.

3:52:42.880 --> 3:52:49.540
 Capitalism – more capital ended up meaning more control.

3:52:49.540 --> 3:52:51.640
 I could put more people under my employment.

3:52:51.640 --> 3:52:57.400
 I could buy larger pieces of land, novel access to resource, mines, and put more technology

3:52:57.400 --> 3:52:58.400
 under my employment.

3:52:58.400 --> 3:53:02.360
 So it meant increased agency and also increased control.

3:53:02.360 --> 3:53:07.740
 I think attentionalism is even more powerful.

3:53:07.740 --> 3:53:14.680
 So rather than enslave people where the people kind of always want to get away and put in

3:53:14.680 --> 3:53:19.120
 the least work they can, there's a way in which economic servitude was just more profitable

3:53:19.120 --> 3:53:21.800
 than slavery, right?

3:53:21.800 --> 3:53:26.100
 Have the people work even harder voluntarily because they want to get ahead and nobody

3:53:26.100 --> 3:53:30.740
 has to be there to whip them or control them or whatever.

3:53:30.740 --> 3:53:35.680
 This is a cynical take but a meaningful take.

3:53:35.680 --> 3:53:43.320
 So people – so capital ends up being a way to influence human behavior, right?

3:53:43.320 --> 3:53:48.680
 And yet where people still feel free in some meaningful way.

3:53:48.680 --> 3:53:53.200
 They're not feeling like they're going to be punished by the state if they don't do

3:53:53.200 --> 3:53:54.200
 something.

3:53:54.200 --> 3:53:56.680
 It's like punished by the market via homelessness or something.

3:53:56.680 --> 3:54:01.420
 But the market is this invisible thing I can't put an agent on so it feels like free.

3:54:01.420 --> 3:54:10.800
 And so if you want to affect people's behavior and still have them feel free, capital ends

3:54:10.800 --> 3:54:12.560
 up being a way to do that.

3:54:12.560 --> 3:54:18.480
 But I think affecting their attention is even deeper because if I can affect their attention,

3:54:18.480 --> 3:54:22.960
 I can both affect what they want and what they believe and what they feel.

3:54:22.960 --> 3:54:24.680
 And we statistically know this very clearly.

3:54:24.680 --> 3:54:29.360
 Facebook has done studies that based on changing the feed, it can change beliefs, emotional

3:54:29.360 --> 3:54:31.640
 dispositions, et cetera.

3:54:31.640 --> 3:54:38.000
 And so I think there's a way that the harvest and directing of attention is even a more

3:54:38.000 --> 3:54:39.840
 powerful system than capitalism.

3:54:39.840 --> 3:54:44.660
 It is effective in capitalism to generate capital, but I think it also generates influence

3:54:44.660 --> 3:54:46.760
 beyond what capital can do.

3:54:46.760 --> 3:54:56.840
 And so do we want to have some groups utilizing that type of tech to direct other people's

3:54:56.840 --> 3:54:57.840
 attention?

3:54:57.840 --> 3:55:03.280
 If so, towards what?

3:55:03.280 --> 3:55:07.320
 Towards what metrics of what a good civilization and good human life would be?

3:55:07.320 --> 3:55:08.920
 What's the oversight process?

3:55:08.920 --> 3:55:09.920
 What is the...

3:55:09.920 --> 3:55:10.920
 Transparency.

3:55:10.920 --> 3:55:14.920
 I can answer all the things you're mentioning.

3:55:14.920 --> 3:55:20.720
 I can build, I guarantee you if I'm not such a lazy ass, I'll be part of the many people

3:55:20.720 --> 3:55:26.360
 doing this as transparency and control, giving control to individual people.

3:55:26.360 --> 3:55:27.360
 Okay.

3:55:27.360 --> 3:55:36.120
 So maybe the corporation has coordination on its goals that all of its customers or

3:55:36.120 --> 3:55:37.660
 users together don't have.

3:55:37.660 --> 3:55:44.880
 So there's some asymmetry of its goals, but maybe I could actually help all of

3:55:44.880 --> 3:55:50.160
 the customers to coordinate almost like a labor union or whatever by informing and educating

3:55:50.160 --> 3:55:54.940
 them adequately about the effects, the externalities on them.

3:55:54.940 --> 3:55:58.080
 This is not toxic waste going into the ocean of the atmosphere.

3:55:58.080 --> 3:56:03.520
 It's their minds, their beings, their families, their relationships, such that they will in

3:56:03.520 --> 3:56:10.920
 group change their behavior.

3:56:10.920 --> 3:56:16.000
 One way of saying what you're saying, I think, is that you think that you can rescue homo

3:56:16.000 --> 3:56:23.180
 economicus from the rational actor that will pursue all the goods and services and choose

3:56:23.180 --> 3:56:27.160
 the best one at the best price, the kind of Rand von Mises Hayek, that you can rescue

3:56:27.160 --> 3:56:31.400
 that from Dan Ariely and behavioral econ that says that's actually not how people make choices.

3:56:31.400 --> 3:56:35.200
 They make it based on status hacking, largely whether it's good for them or not in the long

3:56:35.200 --> 3:56:36.360
 term.

3:56:36.360 --> 3:56:41.400
 And the large asymmetric corporation can run propaganda and narrative warfare that hits

3:56:41.400 --> 3:56:46.760
 people's status buttons and their limbic hijacks and their lots of other things in ways that

3:56:46.760 --> 3:56:50.000
 they can't even perceive that are happening.

3:56:50.000 --> 3:56:51.480
 They're not paying attention to that.

3:56:51.480 --> 3:56:55.120
 The site is employing psychologists and split testing and whatever else.

3:56:55.120 --> 3:57:00.040
 So you're saying, I think we can recover homo economicus.

3:57:00.040 --> 3:57:03.000
 And not just through a single mechanism of technology.

3:57:03.000 --> 3:57:09.880
 There's the, not to keep mentioning the guy, but platforms like Joe Rogan and so on, that

3:57:09.880 --> 3:57:20.160
 make help make viral the ways that the education of negative externalities can become viral

3:57:20.160 --> 3:57:21.160
 in this world.

3:57:21.160 --> 3:57:26.560
 So interestingly, I actually agree with you that

3:57:26.560 --> 3:57:33.360
 I got them that we four and a half hours in that we can take can do some good.

3:57:33.360 --> 3:57:34.360
 All right.

3:57:34.360 --> 3:57:38.760
 Well, see, what you're talking about is the application of tech here, broadcast tech where

3:57:38.760 --> 3:57:40.500
 you can speak to a lot of people.

3:57:40.500 --> 3:57:44.160
 And that's not going to be strong enough because the different people need spoken to differently,

3:57:44.160 --> 3:57:47.120
 which means it has to be different voices that get amplified to those audiences more

3:57:47.120 --> 3:57:48.260
 like Facebook's tech.

3:57:48.260 --> 3:57:52.040
 But nonetheless, we'll start with broadcast tech plants the first seed and then the word

3:57:52.040 --> 3:57:53.920
 of mouth is a powerful thing.

3:57:53.920 --> 3:57:59.440
 You need to do the first broadcast shotgun and then it like lands a catapult or whatever.

3:57:59.440 --> 3:58:03.720
 I don't know what the right weapon is, but then it just spreads the word of mouth through

3:58:03.720 --> 3:58:06.280
 all kinds of tech, including Facebook.

3:58:06.280 --> 3:58:08.160
 So let's come back to the fundamental thing.

3:58:08.160 --> 3:58:14.660
 The fundamental thing is we want to kind of order at various scales from the conflicting

3:58:14.660 --> 3:58:22.360
 parts of ourself, actually having more harmony than they might have to a family, extended

3:58:22.360 --> 3:58:25.640
 family, local, all the way up to global.

3:58:25.640 --> 3:58:33.640
 We want emergent order where our choices have more alignment, right?

3:58:33.640 --> 3:58:38.360
 We want that to be emergent rather than imposed or rather than we want fundamentally different

3:58:38.360 --> 3:58:42.680
 things or make totally different sense of the world where warfare of some kind becomes

3:58:42.680 --> 3:58:45.040
 the only solution.

3:58:45.040 --> 3:58:50.680
 Emergent order requires us in our choice making, requires us being able to have related sense

3:58:50.680 --> 3:58:55.160
 making and related meaning making processes.

3:58:55.160 --> 3:59:02.560
 Can we apply digital technologies and exponential tech in general to try to increase the capacity

3:59:02.560 --> 3:59:06.200
 to do that where the technology called a town hall, the social tech that we'd all get together

3:59:06.200 --> 3:59:11.200
 and talk obviously is very scale limited and it's also oriented to geography rather than

3:59:11.200 --> 3:59:13.200
 networks of aligned interest.

3:59:13.200 --> 3:59:16.200
 Can we build new better versions of those types of things?

3:59:16.200 --> 3:59:23.280
 And going back to the idea that a democracy or participatory governance depends upon comprehensive

3:59:23.280 --> 3:59:27.080
 education and the science of government, which include being able to understand things like

3:59:27.080 --> 3:59:31.520
 asymmetric information warfare on the side of governments and how the people can organize

3:59:31.520 --> 3:59:33.360
 adequately.

3:59:33.360 --> 3:59:38.920
 Can you utilize some of the technologies now to be able to support increased comprehensive

3:59:38.920 --> 3:59:44.700
 education of the people and maybe comprehensive informativeness, so both fixing the decay

3:59:44.700 --> 3:59:48.480
 in both education and the fourth estate that have happened so that people can start self

3:59:48.480 --> 3:59:55.440
 organizing to then influence the corporations, the nation states to do different things and

3:59:55.440 --> 3:59:57.080
 or build new ones themselves?

3:59:57.080 --> 4:00:00.800
 Yeah, fundamentally that's the thing that has to happen.

4:00:00.800 --> 4:00:05.060
 The exponential tech gives us a novel problem landscape that the world never had.

4:00:05.060 --> 4:00:09.480
 The nuke gave us a novel problem landscape and so that required this whole Bretton Woods

4:00:09.480 --> 4:00:10.580
 world.

4:00:10.580 --> 4:00:15.320
 The exponential tech gives us a novel problem landscape, our existing problem solving processes

4:00:15.320 --> 4:00:16.620
 aren't doing a good job.

4:00:16.620 --> 4:00:21.360
 We have had more countries get nukes, we have a nuclear de proliferation, we haven't achieved

4:00:21.360 --> 4:00:26.200
 any of the UN sustainable development goals, we haven't kept any of the new categories

4:00:26.200 --> 4:00:30.640
 of tech from making arms races, so our global coordination is not adequate to the problem

4:00:30.640 --> 4:00:32.280
 landscape.

4:00:32.280 --> 4:00:36.540
 So we need fundamentally better problem solving processes, a market or a state is a problem

4:00:36.540 --> 4:00:37.540
 solving process.

4:00:37.540 --> 4:00:41.560
 We need better ones that can do the speed and scale of the current issues.

4:00:41.560 --> 4:00:46.240
 Right now speed is one of the other big things is that by the time we regulated DDT out of

4:00:46.240 --> 4:00:50.720
 existence or cigarettes not for people under 18, they had already killed so many people

4:00:50.720 --> 4:00:52.980
 and we let the market do the thing.

4:00:52.980 --> 4:00:59.400
 But as Elon has made the point that won't work for AI, by the time we recognize afterwards

4:00:59.400 --> 4:01:02.840
 that we have an auto poetic AI that's a problem, you won't be able to reverse it, that there's

4:01:02.840 --> 4:01:07.760
 a number of things that when you're dealing with tech that is either self replicating

4:01:07.760 --> 4:01:11.800
 and disintermediate humans to keep going, doesn't need humans to keep going, or you

4:01:11.800 --> 4:01:17.720
 have tech that just has exponentially fast effects, your regulation has to come early.

4:01:17.720 --> 4:01:23.240
 It can't come after the effects have happened, the negative effects have happened because

4:01:23.240 --> 4:01:25.480
 the negative effects could be too big too quickly.

4:01:25.480 --> 4:01:31.840
 So we basically need new problem solving processes that do better at being able to internalize

4:01:31.840 --> 4:01:36.160
 this externality, solve the problems on the right time scale and the right geographic

4:01:36.160 --> 4:01:37.900
 scale.

4:01:37.900 --> 4:01:44.480
 And those new processes to not be imposed have to emerge from people wanting them and

4:01:44.480 --> 4:01:48.400
 being able to participate in their development, which is what I would call kind of a new cultural

4:01:48.400 --> 4:01:54.360
 enlightenment or renaissance that has to happen, where people start understanding the new power

4:01:54.360 --> 4:02:00.480
 that exponential tech offers, the way that it is actually damaging current governance

4:02:00.480 --> 4:02:07.200
 structures that we care about, and creating an extra landscape, but could also be redirected

4:02:07.200 --> 4:02:13.140
 towards more protopic purposes, and then saying, how do we rebuild new social institutions?

4:02:13.140 --> 4:02:17.200
 What are adequate social institutions where we can do participatory governance at scale

4:02:17.200 --> 4:02:19.160
 and time?

4:02:19.160 --> 4:02:24.100
 And how can the people actually participate to build those things?

4:02:24.100 --> 4:02:29.600
 The solution that I see working requires a process like that.

4:02:29.600 --> 4:02:32.360
 And the result maximizes love.

4:02:32.360 --> 4:02:36.200
 So again, Elon would be right that love is the answer.

4:02:36.200 --> 4:02:42.680
 Let me take you back from the scale of societies to the scale that's far, far more important,

4:02:42.680 --> 4:02:47.480
 which is the scale of family.

4:02:47.480 --> 4:02:50.120
 You've written a blog post about your dad.

4:02:50.120 --> 4:02:56.920
 We have various flavors of relationships with our fathers.

4:02:56.920 --> 4:03:01.160
 What have you learned about life from your dad?

4:03:01.160 --> 4:03:06.600
 Well, people can read the blog post and see a lot of individual things that I learned

4:03:06.600 --> 4:03:07.600
 that I really appreciated.

4:03:07.600 --> 4:03:18.520
 If I was to kind of summarize at a high level, I had a really incredible dad, very, very

4:03:18.520 --> 4:03:23.240
 unusually positive set of experiences.

4:03:23.240 --> 4:03:28.880
 We were homeschooled, and he was committed to work from home to be available and prioritize

4:03:28.880 --> 4:03:35.680
 fathering in a really deep way.

4:03:35.680 --> 4:03:41.680
 And as a super gifted, super loving, very unique man, he also had his unique issues

4:03:41.680 --> 4:03:46.040
 that were part of what crafted the unique brilliance, and those things often go together.

4:03:46.040 --> 4:03:52.360
 And I say that because I think I had some unusual gifts and also some unusual difficulties.

4:03:52.360 --> 4:03:59.280
 And I think it's useful for everybody to know their path probably has both of those.

4:03:59.280 --> 4:04:05.880
 But if I was to say kind of the essence of one of the things my dad taught me across

4:04:05.880 --> 4:04:13.320
 a lot of lessons was like the intersection of self empowerment, ideas and practices that

4:04:13.320 --> 4:04:21.160
 self empower, towards collective good, towards some virtuous purpose beyond the self.

4:04:21.160 --> 4:04:25.600
 And he both said that a million different ways, taught it in a million different ways.

4:04:25.600 --> 4:04:31.720
 When we were doing construction and he was teaching me how to build a house, we were

4:04:31.720 --> 4:04:35.380
 putting the wires to the walls before the drywall went on, he made sure that the way

4:04:35.380 --> 4:04:37.720
 that we put the wires through was beautiful.

4:04:37.720 --> 4:04:44.200
 Like that the height of the holes was similar, that we twisted the wires in a particular

4:04:44.200 --> 4:04:45.200
 way.

4:04:45.200 --> 4:04:47.400
 And it's like no one's ever going to see it.

4:04:47.400 --> 4:04:50.760
 And he's like, if a job's worth doing, it's worth doing well, and excellence is its own

4:04:50.760 --> 4:04:51.760
 reward.

4:04:51.760 --> 4:04:52.760
 And those types of ideas.

4:04:52.760 --> 4:04:55.120
 And if there was a really shitty job to do, he'd say, see the job, do the job, stay out

4:04:55.120 --> 4:04:56.120
 of the misery.

4:04:56.120 --> 4:04:59.400
 Just don't indulge any negativity, do the things that need done.

4:04:59.400 --> 4:05:06.440
 And so there's like, there's an empowerment and a nobility together.

4:05:06.440 --> 4:05:10.600
 And yeah, extraordinarily fortunate.

4:05:10.600 --> 4:05:13.960
 Is there ways you think you could have been a better son?

4:05:13.960 --> 4:05:16.640
 Is there things you regret?

4:05:16.640 --> 4:05:18.440
 Interesting question.

4:05:18.440 --> 4:05:28.480
 Let me first say, just as a bit of a criticism, that what kind of man do you think you are

4:05:28.480 --> 4:05:34.360
 not wearing a suit and tie, if a real man should?

4:05:34.360 --> 4:05:36.680
 Exactly I agree with your dad on that point.

4:05:36.680 --> 4:05:44.360
 You mentioned offline that he suggested a real man should wear a suit and tie.

4:05:44.360 --> 4:05:48.600
 But outside of that, is there ways you could have been a better son?

4:05:48.600 --> 4:05:52.600
 Maybe next time on your show, I'll wear a suit and tie.

4:05:52.600 --> 4:06:12.560
 My dad would be happy about that.

4:06:12.560 --> 4:06:17.400
 I can answer the question later in life, not early.

4:06:17.400 --> 4:06:20.680
 I had just a huge amount of respect and reverence for my dad when I was young.

4:06:20.680 --> 4:06:23.920
 So I was asking myself that question a lot.

4:06:23.920 --> 4:06:32.320
 So there weren't a lot of things I knew that I wasn't seeking to apply.

4:06:32.320 --> 4:06:39.160
 There was a phase when I went through my kind of individuation, differentiation, where I

4:06:39.160 --> 4:06:43.280
 had to make him excessively wrong about too many things.

4:06:43.280 --> 4:06:46.200
 I don't think I had to, but I did.

4:06:46.200 --> 4:06:55.600
 And he had a lot of kind of nonstandard model beliefs about things, whether early kind of

4:06:55.600 --> 4:07:03.480
 ancient civilizations or ideas on evolutionary theory or alternate models of physics.

4:07:03.480 --> 4:07:10.520
 And they weren't irrational, but they didn't all have the standard of epistemic proof that

4:07:10.520 --> 4:07:12.560
 I would need.

4:07:12.560 --> 4:07:19.920
 And I went through, and some of them were kind of spiritual ideas as well, I went through

4:07:19.920 --> 4:07:31.440
 a phase in my early 20s where I kind of had the attitude that Dawkins or a Christopher

4:07:31.440 --> 4:07:41.720
 Hitchens has that can kind of be like excessively certain and sanctimonious, applying their

4:07:41.720 --> 4:07:47.960
 reductionist philosophy of science to everything and kind of brutally dismissive.

4:07:47.960 --> 4:07:52.960
 I'm embarrassed by that phase.

4:07:52.960 --> 4:07:57.040
 Not to say anything about those men and their path, but for myself.

4:07:57.040 --> 4:08:05.080
 And so during that time, I was more dismissive of my dad's epistemology than I would have

4:08:05.080 --> 4:08:06.080
 liked to have been.

4:08:06.080 --> 4:08:09.000
 I got to correct that later and apologize for it.

4:08:09.000 --> 4:08:12.120
 But that's the first thought that came to mind.

4:08:12.120 --> 4:08:14.240
 You've written the following.

4:08:14.240 --> 4:08:22.440
 I've had the experience countless times, making love, watching a sunset, listening to music,

4:08:22.440 --> 4:08:29.840
 feeling the breeze, that I would sign up for this whole life and all of its pains just

4:08:29.840 --> 4:08:33.480
 to experience this exact moment.

4:08:33.480 --> 4:08:37.360
 This is a kind of wordless knowing.

4:08:37.360 --> 4:08:42.400
 It's the most important and real truth I know, that experience itself is infinitely

4:08:42.400 --> 4:08:46.640
 meaningful and pain is temporary.

4:08:46.640 --> 4:08:50.200
 And seen clearly, even the suffering is filled with beauty.

4:08:50.200 --> 4:08:57.920
 I've experienced countless lives worth of moments worthy of life, such an unreasonable

4:08:57.920 --> 4:08:58.920
 fortune.

4:08:58.920 --> 4:09:03.720
 A few words of gratitude from you, beautifully written.

4:09:03.720 --> 4:09:05.360
 Is there some beautiful moments?

4:09:05.360 --> 4:09:11.280
 Now you have experienced countless lives worth of those moments, but is there some things

4:09:11.280 --> 4:09:20.360
 that if you could, in your darker moments, you can go to to relive, to remind yourself

4:09:20.360 --> 4:09:22.840
 that the whole ride is worthwhile?

4:09:22.840 --> 4:09:24.400
 Maybe skip the making love part.

4:09:24.400 --> 4:09:27.880
 We don't want to know about that.

4:09:27.880 --> 4:09:42.800
 I mean, I feel unreasonably fortunate that it is such a humongous list because, I mean,

4:09:42.800 --> 4:09:48.000
 I feel fortunate to have like had exposure to practices and philosophies in a way of

4:09:48.000 --> 4:09:50.080
 seeing things that makes me see things that way.

4:09:50.080 --> 4:09:55.200
 So I can take responsibility for seeing things in that way and not taking for granted really

4:09:55.200 --> 4:09:58.560
 wonderful things, but I can't take credit for being exposed to the philosophies that

4:09:58.560 --> 4:10:03.760
 even gave me that possibility.

4:10:03.760 --> 4:10:10.400
 You know, it's not just with my wife, it's with every person who I really love when we're

4:10:10.400 --> 4:10:14.920
 talking and I look at their face, I, in the context of a conversation, feel overwhelmed

4:10:14.920 --> 4:10:17.960
 by how lucky I am to get to know them.

4:10:17.960 --> 4:10:21.680
 And like there's never been someone like them in all of history and there never will be

4:10:21.680 --> 4:10:24.820
 again and they might be gone tomorrow, I might be gone tomorrow and like I get this moment

4:10:24.820 --> 4:10:25.820
 with them.

4:10:25.820 --> 4:10:30.320
 And when you take in the uniqueness of that fully and the beauty of it, it's overwhelmingly

4:10:30.320 --> 4:10:33.720
 beautiful.

4:10:33.720 --> 4:10:42.240
 And I remember the first time I did a big dose of mushrooms and I was looking at a tree

4:10:42.240 --> 4:10:47.080
 for a long time and I was just crying with overwhelming how beautiful the tree was.

4:10:47.080 --> 4:10:50.000
 And it was a tree outside the front of my house that I'd walked by a million times and

4:10:50.000 --> 4:10:52.280
 never looked at like this.

4:10:52.280 --> 4:10:58.000
 And it wasn't the dose of mushrooms where I was hallucinating like where the tree was

4:10:58.000 --> 4:10:59.000
 purple.

4:10:59.000 --> 4:11:02.320
 Like the tree still looked like, if I had to describe it, it's green and it has leaves,

4:11:02.320 --> 4:11:08.480
 looks like this, but it was way fucking more beautiful, like capturing than it normally

4:11:08.480 --> 4:11:09.480
 was.

4:11:09.480 --> 4:11:12.100
 And I'm like, why is it so beautiful if I would describe it the same way?

4:11:12.100 --> 4:11:15.760
 And I realized I had no thoughts taking me anywhere else.

4:11:15.760 --> 4:11:19.320
 Like what it seemed like the mushrooms were doing was just actually shutting the narrative

4:11:19.320 --> 4:11:22.960
 off that would have me be distracted so I could really see the tree.

4:11:22.960 --> 4:11:25.240
 And then I'm like, fuck, when I get off these mushrooms, I'm going to practice seeing the

4:11:25.240 --> 4:11:29.320
 tree because it's always that beautiful and I just miss it.

4:11:29.320 --> 4:11:33.360
 And so I practice being with it and quieting the rest of the mind and then being like,

4:11:33.360 --> 4:11:34.360
 wow.

4:11:34.360 --> 4:11:39.120
 And if it's not mushrooms, like people have peak experiences where they'll see life and

4:11:39.120 --> 4:11:40.120
 how incredible it is.

4:11:40.120 --> 4:11:41.120
 It's always there.

4:11:41.120 --> 4:11:49.160
 It's funny that I had this exact same experience on quite a lot of mushrooms just sitting alone

4:11:49.160 --> 4:11:55.280
 and looking at a tree and exactly as you described it, appreciating the undistorted beauty of

4:11:55.280 --> 4:11:56.280
 it.

4:11:56.280 --> 4:12:02.520
 And it's funny to me that here's two humans, very different with very different journeys

4:12:02.520 --> 4:12:09.400
 or at some moment in time, both looking at a tree like idiots for hours and just in awe

4:12:09.400 --> 4:12:10.400
 and happy to be alive.

4:12:10.400 --> 4:12:17.800
 And yeah, even just that moment alone is worth living for, but you did say humans and we

4:12:17.800 --> 4:12:25.760
 have a moment together as two humans and you mentioned shots that I have to ask, what are

4:12:25.760 --> 4:12:27.080
 we looking at?

4:12:27.080 --> 4:12:32.120
 When I went to go get a smoothie before coming here, I got you a keto smoothie that you didn't

4:12:32.120 --> 4:12:35.080
 want because you're not just keto, but fasting.

4:12:35.080 --> 4:12:39.940
 But I saw the thing with you and your dad where you did shots together and this place

4:12:39.940 --> 4:12:45.960
 happened to have shots of ginger, turmeric, cayenne juice of some kind.

4:12:45.960 --> 4:12:52.360
 So I didn't necessarily plan it for being on the show, I just brought it, but we can

4:12:52.360 --> 4:12:53.360
 do it that way.

4:12:53.360 --> 4:12:59.160
 I think we shall toast like heroes, Daniel.

4:12:59.160 --> 4:13:00.160
 It's a huge honor.

4:13:00.160 --> 4:13:01.760
 What do we toast to?

4:13:01.760 --> 4:13:06.960
 We toast to this moment, this unique moment that we get to share together.

4:13:06.960 --> 4:13:11.480
 I'm very grateful to be here in this moment with you and yeah, I'm grateful that you invited

4:13:11.480 --> 4:13:12.480
 me here.

4:13:12.480 --> 4:13:23.000
 We met for the first time and I will never be the same for the good and the bad, I am.

4:13:23.000 --> 4:13:24.360
 That is really interesting.

4:13:24.360 --> 4:13:29.400
 That feels way healthier than the vodka my dad and I were drinking.

4:13:29.400 --> 4:13:33.280
 So I feel like a better man already, Daniel, this is one of the best conversations I've

4:13:33.280 --> 4:13:34.280
 ever had.

4:13:34.280 --> 4:13:36.240
 I can't wait to have many more.

4:13:36.240 --> 4:13:37.240
 Likewise.

4:13:37.240 --> 4:13:39.200
 This has been an amazing experience.

4:13:39.200 --> 4:13:40.800
 Thank you for wasting all your time today.

4:13:40.800 --> 4:13:48.720
 I want to say in terms of what you're mentioning about like the, that you work in machine learning

4:13:48.720 --> 4:13:55.160
 and the optimism that wants to look at the issues, but wants to look at how this increased

4:13:55.160 --> 4:14:00.600
 technological power could be applied to solving them and that even thinking about the broadcast

4:14:00.600 --> 4:14:05.640
 of like, can I help people understand the issues better and help organize them?

4:14:05.640 --> 4:14:13.120
 Like fundamentally you're oriented like Wikipedia, what I see, to really try to tend to the information

4:14:13.120 --> 4:14:18.040
 commons without another agentic interest distorting it.

4:14:18.040 --> 4:14:24.520
 And for you to be able to get guys like Lee Smolin and Roger Penrose and like the greatest

4:14:24.520 --> 4:14:29.880
 thinkers of, that are alive and have them on the show and most people would never be

4:14:29.880 --> 4:14:34.520
 exposed to them and talk about it in a way that people can understand, I think it's an

4:14:34.520 --> 4:14:35.680
 incredible service.

4:14:35.680 --> 4:14:37.000
 I think you're doing great work.

4:14:37.000 --> 4:14:39.480
 So I was really happy to hear from you.

4:14:39.480 --> 4:14:41.400
 Thank you, Daniel.

4:14:41.400 --> 4:14:44.520
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Daniel Schmachtenberger and thank you

4:14:44.520 --> 4:14:51.760
 to Ground News, NetSuite, Four Sigmatic, Magic Spoon, and BetterHelp.

4:14:51.760 --> 4:14:55.640
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

4:14:55.640 --> 4:14:59.640
 And now let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein.

4:14:59.640 --> 4:15:05.600
 I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought

4:15:05.600 --> 4:15:08.200
 with sticks and stones.

4:15:08.200 --> 4:15:30.320
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
