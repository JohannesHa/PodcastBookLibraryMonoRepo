00:00.000 --> 00:02.500
 The following is a conversation with Michael Mina.

00:02.500 --> 00:05.300
 He's a professor at Harvard doing research

00:05.300 --> 00:08.100
 on infectious disease and immunology.

00:08.100 --> 00:10.640
 The most defining characteristic of his approach

00:10.640 --> 00:14.060
 to science and biology is that of a first principles thinker

00:14.060 --> 00:17.820
 and engineer focused not just on defining the problem,

00:17.820 --> 00:20.100
 but finding the solution.

00:20.100 --> 00:24.020
 In that spirit, we talk about cheap rapid at home testing,

00:24.020 --> 00:27.260
 which is a solution to COVID 19 that to me has become

00:27.260 --> 00:31.520
 one of the most obvious, powerful, and doable solutions

00:31.520 --> 00:33.780
 that frankly should have been done months ago

00:33.780 --> 00:35.700
 and still should be done now.

00:35.700 --> 00:37.700
 As we talk about its accuracy,

00:37.700 --> 00:40.360
 it's high for detecting actual contagiousness

00:40.360 --> 00:43.000
 and hundreds of millions can be manufactured quickly

00:43.000 --> 00:44.660
 and relatively cheaply.

00:44.660 --> 00:47.580
 In general, I love engineering solutions like these

00:47.580 --> 00:51.280
 even if government bureaucracies often don't.

00:51.280 --> 00:54.920
 It respects science and data, it respects our freedom,

00:54.920 --> 00:58.180
 it respects our intelligence and basic common sense.

00:59.180 --> 01:00.500
 Quick mention of each sponsor

01:00.500 --> 01:02.860
 followed by some thoughts related to the episode.

01:02.860 --> 01:06.580
 Thank you to Brave, a fast browser that feels like Chrome

01:06.580 --> 01:09.200
 but has more privacy preserving features,

01:09.200 --> 01:11.500
 Athletic Greens, the all in one drink

01:11.500 --> 01:12.780
 that I start every day with

01:12.780 --> 01:14.980
 to cover all my nutritional bases,

01:14.980 --> 01:18.340

01:18.340 --> 01:20.380
 to protect my privacy on the internet,

01:20.380 --> 01:24.380
 and Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends.

01:29.980 --> 01:31.620
 As a side note, let me say that

01:31.620 --> 01:35.660
 I've always been solution oriented, not problem oriented.

01:35.660 --> 01:38.180
 It saddens me to see that public discourse

01:38.180 --> 01:41.060
 disproportionately focuses on the mistakes

01:41.060 --> 01:43.620
 of those who dare to build solutions

01:43.620 --> 01:46.380
 rather than applaud their attempt to do so.

01:46.380 --> 01:48.260
 Teddy Roosevelt said it well

01:48.260 --> 01:52.220
 in his The Man in the Arena speech over 100 years ago.

01:52.220 --> 01:54.580
 I should say that both the critic

01:54.580 --> 01:56.820
 and the creator are important,

01:56.820 --> 01:59.140
 but in my humble estimation,

01:59.140 --> 02:01.740
 there are too many now of the former

02:01.740 --> 02:03.600
 and not enough of the latter.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.860
 So while we spread the derisive words

02:06.860 --> 02:10.220
 of the critic on social media, making it viral,

02:10.220 --> 02:13.060
 let's not forget that this world is built

02:13.060 --> 02:17.180
 on the blood, sweat, and tears of those who dare to create.

02:28.020 --> 02:31.540
 And now, here's my conversation with Michael Minna.

02:32.580 --> 02:35.140
 What is the most beautiful, mysterious,

02:35.140 --> 02:39.620
 or surprising idea in the biology of humans or viruses

02:39.620 --> 02:41.720
 that you've ever come across in your work?

02:41.720 --> 02:43.860
 Sorry for the overly philosophical question.

02:45.260 --> 02:47.720
 Wow, well that's a great question.

02:47.720 --> 02:50.340
 You know, I love the pathogenesis of viruses,

02:50.340 --> 02:55.340
 and one of the things that I've worked on a lot

02:56.060 --> 03:00.740
 is trying to understand how viruses interact with each other.

03:00.740 --> 03:05.420
 And so pre all this COVID stuff,

03:05.420 --> 03:08.980
 I was really, really dedicated to understanding

03:10.100 --> 03:14.980
 how viruses impact other pathogens,

03:14.980 --> 03:18.140
 so how if somebody gets an infection with one thing

03:18.140 --> 03:21.660
 or a vaccine, does it either benefit or harm you

03:21.660 --> 03:26.660
 from other things that appear to be unrelated to most people.

03:26.940 --> 03:31.940
 And so one system which is highly detrimental to humans,

03:32.660 --> 03:37.260
 but what I think is just immensely fascinating, is measles.

03:37.260 --> 03:40.900
 And measles gets into a kid's body.

03:40.900 --> 03:43.180
 The immune system picks it up,

03:43.180 --> 03:47.660
 and essentially grabs the virus,

03:47.660 --> 03:50.820
 and does exactly what it's supposed to do,

03:50.820 --> 03:52.260
 which is to take this virus

03:52.260 --> 03:54.020
 and bring it into the immune system

03:54.020 --> 03:56.340
 so that the immune system can learn from it,

03:56.340 --> 03:58.820
 can develop an immune response to it.

03:58.820 --> 04:00.740
 But instead, measles plays a trick.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.060
 It gets into the immune system,

04:03.060 --> 04:05.160
 serves almost as a Trojan horse,

04:05.160 --> 04:08.540
 and instead of getting eaten by these cells,

04:08.540 --> 04:10.060
 it just takes them over,

04:10.060 --> 04:12.260
 and it ends up proliferating in the very cells

04:12.260 --> 04:14.520
 that were supposed to kill it.

04:15.420 --> 04:17.960
 And it just distributes throughout the entire body,

04:17.960 --> 04:19.140
 gets into the bone marrow,

04:19.140 --> 04:22.620
 kills off children's immune memories.

04:22.620 --> 04:25.500
 And so it essentially, what I've found

04:25.500 --> 04:28.680
 and what my research has found is that this one virus

04:28.680 --> 04:31.620
 was responsible for as much as half

04:31.620 --> 04:34.320
 of all of the infectious disease deaths in kids

04:34.320 --> 04:36.420
 before we started vaccinating against it,

04:36.420 --> 04:40.200
 because it was just wiping out children's immune memories

04:40.200 --> 04:41.560
 to all different pathogens,

04:41.560 --> 04:45.100
 which is, I think, just astounding.

04:45.100 --> 04:49.000
 It's just amazing to watch it spread throughout bodies.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.400
 We've done the studies in monkeys,

04:50.400 --> 04:52.900
 and you can watch it just destroy

04:52.900 --> 04:54.860
 and obliterate people's immune memories

04:54.860 --> 04:57.140
 in the same way that some parasite

04:57.140 --> 04:58.860
 might destroy somebody's brain.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.480
 Is that evolutionary just coincidence,

05:03.480 --> 05:04.980
 or is there some kind of advantage

05:04.980 --> 05:08.560
 to this kind of interactivity between pathogens?

05:08.560 --> 05:11.740
 Oh, I think in that sense, it's just coincidence.

05:11.740 --> 05:15.520
 It probably is a, it's a good way for measles to,

05:17.600 --> 05:19.540
 it's a good way for measles to essentially

05:19.540 --> 05:23.180
 be able to survive long enough to replicate in the body.

05:23.180 --> 05:25.180
 It just replicates in the cells

05:25.180 --> 05:26.480
 that are meant to destroy it.

05:26.480 --> 05:31.480
 So it's utilizing our immune cells for its own replication,

05:32.180 --> 05:34.500
 but in so doing, it's destroying the memories

05:34.500 --> 05:37.180
 of all the other immunological memories.

05:37.180 --> 05:38.780
 But there are other viruses,

05:38.780 --> 05:42.200
 so a different system is influenza,

05:42.200 --> 05:47.200
 and flu predisposes to severe bacterial infections.

05:47.940 --> 05:50.580
 And that, I think, is another coincidence,

05:50.580 --> 05:55.380
 but I also think that there are some evolutionary benefits

05:55.380 --> 05:57.380
 that bacteria may hijack

05:57.380 --> 05:59.460
 and sort of piggyback on viral infections.

05:59.460 --> 06:04.220
 Viruses can, they just grow so much quicker than bacteria.

06:04.220 --> 06:05.580
 They replicate faster,

06:05.580 --> 06:07.660
 and so there's this system with viruses,

06:07.660 --> 06:09.220
 with flu and bacteria,

06:09.220 --> 06:12.620
 where the influenza has these proteins

06:12.620 --> 06:14.780
 that cleave certain receptors,

06:15.660 --> 06:18.140
 and the bacteria want to cleave those same receptors.

06:18.140 --> 06:19.640
 They want to cleave the same molecules

06:19.640 --> 06:22.780
 that gave entrance to those receptors.

06:22.780 --> 06:25.140
 So instead, the bacteria found out, like,

06:25.140 --> 06:28.020
 hey, we could just piggyback on these viruses.

06:28.020 --> 06:31.700
 They'll do it 100 or 1,000 times faster than we can.

06:31.700 --> 06:33.860
 And so then they just piggyback on,

06:33.860 --> 06:37.020
 and they let flu cleave all these sialic acids,

06:37.020 --> 06:39.860
 and then the bacteria just glom on in the wake of it.

06:39.860 --> 06:43.100
 So there's all different interactions between pathogens

06:43.100 --> 06:45.280
 that are just remarkable.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.220
 So does this whole system of viruses

06:48.220 --> 06:49.420
 that interact with each other

06:49.420 --> 06:52.100
 and so damn good at getting inside our bodies,

06:52.100 --> 06:54.880
 does that fascinate you or terrify you?

06:54.880 --> 06:56.320
 I'm very much a scientist,

06:56.320 --> 07:00.500
 and so it fascinates me much more than it terrifies me.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.540
 But knowing enough, I know just how well,

07:03.540 --> 07:08.380
 you know, we get the wrong virus in our population,

07:08.380 --> 07:10.460
 whether it's through some random mutation

07:10.460 --> 07:12.680
 or whether it's this same COVID 19 virus,

07:12.680 --> 07:14.580
 and it, you know, these things are tricky.

07:14.580 --> 07:17.400
 They're able to mutate quickly.

07:17.400 --> 07:20.540
 They're able to find new hosts

07:20.540 --> 07:22.920
 and rearrange in the case of influenza.

07:24.060 --> 07:27.220
 So what terrifies me is just how easily

07:27.220 --> 07:29.760
 this particular pandemic could have been so much worse.

07:29.760 --> 07:30.880
 This could have been a virus

07:30.880 --> 07:33.980
 that is much worse than it is.

07:33.980 --> 07:37.340
 You know, same thing with H1N1 back in 2009.

07:37.340 --> 07:38.320
 That terrifies me.

07:38.320 --> 07:41.620
 If a virus like that was much more detrimental,

07:43.060 --> 07:44.620
 you know, that would be,

07:44.620 --> 07:46.720
 it could be much more devastating.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.100
 Although it's hard to say, you know,

07:48.100 --> 07:52.220
 the human species were, well,

07:52.220 --> 07:56.100
 I hesitate to say that we're good at responding to things

07:56.100 --> 07:58.660
 because there are some aspects that were,

07:58.660 --> 08:01.740
 this particular virus, SARS COVID 2 and COVID 19

08:01.740 --> 08:06.640
 has found a sweet spot where it's not quite serious enough

08:06.640 --> 08:08.860
 on an individual level that humans just don't,

08:08.860 --> 08:12.860
 we haven't seen much of a useful response by many humans.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.860
 A lot of people even think it's a hoax.

08:15.860 --> 08:18.140
 And so it's led us down this path of,

08:19.420 --> 08:20.900
 it's not quite serious enough

08:20.900 --> 08:23.140
 to get everyone to respond immediately

08:23.140 --> 08:26.140
 and with the most urgency, but it's enough,

08:26.140 --> 08:27.540
 it's bad enough that, you know,

08:27.540 --> 08:30.160
 it's caused our economies to shut down and collapse.

08:30.160 --> 08:34.180
 And so I think I know enough about virus biology

08:34.180 --> 08:37.180
 to be terrified for humans that, you know,

08:37.180 --> 08:39.220
 it can, it just takes one virus,

08:39.220 --> 08:42.100
 just takes the wrong one to just obliterate us

08:42.100 --> 08:43.660
 or not obliterate us,

08:43.660 --> 08:45.860
 but really do much more damage than we've seen.

08:45.860 --> 08:47.540
 It's fascinating to think that COVID 19

08:47.540 --> 08:52.540
 is a result of a virus evolving together with like Twitter,

08:52.820 --> 08:55.580
 like figuring out how we can sneak past the defenses

08:55.580 --> 08:56.820
 of the humans.

08:56.820 --> 08:58.820
 So it's not bad enough.

08:58.820 --> 09:00.380
 And then the misinformation,

09:00.380 --> 09:03.060
 all that kind of stuff together is operating

09:03.060 --> 09:06.300
 in such a way that the virus can spread effectively.

09:06.300 --> 09:10.380
 I wonder, I mean, obviously a virus is not intelligent,

09:10.380 --> 09:15.380
 but there's a rhyme and a rhythm

09:16.260 --> 09:18.300
 to the way this whole evolutionary process works

09:18.300 --> 09:20.140
 and creates these fascinating things

09:20.140 --> 09:23.060
 that spread throughout the entire civilization.

09:23.060 --> 09:26.860
 Absolutely, it's, yeah,

09:26.860 --> 09:30.140
 I'm completely fascinated by this idea

09:30.140 --> 09:33.700
 of social media in particular,

09:33.700 --> 09:36.460
 how it replicates, how it grows.

09:36.460 --> 09:40.140
 You know, I've been, how it actually starts interacting

09:40.140 --> 09:42.860
 with the biology of the virus, masks,

09:42.860 --> 09:45.020
 who's gonna get vaccinated, politics,

09:45.020 --> 09:49.340
 like these seem so external to virus biology,

09:49.340 --> 09:52.220
 but it's become so intertwined.

09:52.220 --> 09:55.140
 And it's interesting.

09:55.140 --> 09:56.660
 And I actually think we could find out

09:56.660 --> 09:59.260
 that the virus actually becomes,

10:00.580 --> 10:03.780
 obviously not intentionally,

10:03.780 --> 10:08.380
 but we could find that people choosing not to wear masks,

10:08.380 --> 10:10.940
 choosing not to counter this virus

10:10.940 --> 10:14.260
 in a regimented and sort of organized way,

10:14.260 --> 10:18.060
 effectively gives the virus more opportunity to escape.

10:18.060 --> 10:20.740
 We can look at vaccines.

10:20.740 --> 10:23.220
 We're about to have

10:23.220 --> 10:25.380
 one of the most aggressive vaccination programs

10:25.380 --> 10:26.740
 the world has ever seen.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.740
 But we are unfortunately doing it

10:29.740 --> 10:32.100
 right at the peak of viral transmission

10:32.100 --> 10:34.020
 when millions and millions of people

10:34.020 --> 10:35.500
 are still getting infected.

10:36.420 --> 10:37.340
 And when we do that,

10:37.340 --> 10:40.500
 that just gives this virus so many more opportunities.

10:40.500 --> 10:43.620
 I mean, orders of magnitude more opportunity

10:43.620 --> 10:46.340
 to mutate around our immune system.

10:46.340 --> 10:48.220
 Now, if we were to vaccinate everyone

10:48.220 --> 10:49.820
 when there's not a lot of virus,

10:49.820 --> 10:51.340
 then there's just not a lot of virus.

10:51.340 --> 10:54.180
 And so there's not going to be as many,

10:54.180 --> 10:56.180
 I don't even know how many zeros are at the end

10:56.180 --> 10:57.660
 of however many viral particles

10:57.660 --> 10:59.540
 there are in the world right now,

10:59.540 --> 11:02.020
 more than quadrillions.

11:02.020 --> 11:04.700
 And so if you assume that at any given time,

11:04.700 --> 11:06.660
 somebody might have trillions of virus in them

11:06.660 --> 11:07.980
 and any given individual,

11:07.980 --> 11:10.620
 so then multiply trillions by millions

11:10.620 --> 11:12.980
 and you get a lot of viruses out there.

11:12.980 --> 11:16.260
 And if you start applying pressure, ecological pressure,

11:16.260 --> 11:21.260
 to this virus, that when it's not abundant,

11:21.260 --> 11:25.260
 God, the opportunity for a virus to sneak around immunity,

11:25.260 --> 11:27.860
 especially when all the vaccines are identical,

11:27.860 --> 11:30.140
 essentially, it's...

11:30.140 --> 11:32.820
 All it takes is one to mutate and then jumps.

11:32.820 --> 11:33.660
 Takes one.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.180
 Takes one in the whole world.

11:35.180 --> 11:37.060
 And we have to not forget

11:37.060 --> 11:39.780
 that this particular virus was one.

11:39.780 --> 11:42.940
 It was one opportunity and it has spread across the globe

11:42.940 --> 11:46.140
 and there's no reason that can't happen tomorrow anew.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.060
 It's scary.

11:49.300 --> 11:51.380
 I have a million other questions in this direction,

11:51.380 --> 11:56.100
 but I'd love to talk about one of the most exciting aspects

11:56.100 --> 12:00.700
 of your work, which is testing or rapid testing.

12:00.700 --> 12:04.940
 You wrote a great article in Time on November 17th.

12:04.940 --> 12:09.940
 This is like a month ago about rapid testing titled,

12:10.060 --> 12:13.420
 How We Can Stop the Spread of COVID 19 by Christmas.

12:13.420 --> 12:15.700
 Let's jot down the fact that this is a month ago.

12:15.700 --> 12:17.940
 So maybe your timeline would be different,

12:17.940 --> 12:19.460
 but let's say in a month.

12:19.460 --> 12:21.380
 So you've talked about this powerful idea

12:21.380 --> 12:25.380
 for quite a while throughout the COVID 19 pandemic.

12:25.380 --> 12:28.120
 How do we stop the spread of COVID 19 in a month?

12:29.260 --> 12:33.620
 Well, we use tests like these.

12:33.620 --> 12:36.980
 So the only reason the virus continues spreading

12:36.980 --> 12:39.380
 is because people spread it to each other.

12:39.380 --> 12:41.060
 This isn't magic.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.140
 Yes.

12:42.140 --> 12:45.700
 And so there's a few ways to stop the virus

12:45.700 --> 12:47.940
 from spreading to each other.

12:47.940 --> 12:51.980
 And that is you either can vaccinate everyone

12:51.980 --> 12:55.300
 and vaccinating everyone is a way to immunologically

12:55.300 --> 12:57.500
 prevent the virus from growing inside of somebody

12:57.500 --> 12:58.760
 and therefore spreading.

12:58.760 --> 13:01.220
 We don't know yet actually if this vaccine,

13:01.220 --> 13:03.520
 if any of these vaccines are going to

13:03.520 --> 13:05.160
 prevent onward transmission.

13:05.160 --> 13:10.060
 So that may or may not serve to be one opportunity.

13:10.060 --> 13:12.680
 Certainly I think it will decrease transmission.

13:12.680 --> 13:16.220
 But the other idea that we have at our disposal now,

13:16.220 --> 13:18.540
 we had it in May, we had it in June,

13:18.540 --> 13:21.100
 July, August, September, October, November,

13:21.100 --> 13:22.660
 and now it's December.

13:22.660 --> 13:23.720
 We still have it.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.040
 We still choose not to use it in this country

13:26.040 --> 13:28.140
 and in much of the world.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.300
 And that's rapid testing.

13:29.300 --> 13:32.340
 That is giving, it's empowering people to know

13:33.260 --> 13:35.980
 that they are infected and giving them the opportunity

13:35.980 --> 13:38.340
 to not spread it to their loved ones

13:38.340 --> 13:40.780
 and their friends and neighbors and whoever else.

13:41.860 --> 13:43.640
 We could have done this.

13:43.640 --> 13:44.740
 We still can.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.380
 Today we could start.

13:46.380 --> 13:48.540
 We have millions of these tests.

13:48.540 --> 13:51.820
 These tests are simple paper strip tests.

13:51.820 --> 13:54.660
 They are, inside of this thing

13:54.660 --> 13:56.440
 is just a little piece of paper.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.340
 Now I can actually open it up here.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.540
 There we go.

14:01.540 --> 14:05.260
 So this, this is how we do it right here.

14:05.260 --> 14:08.140
 We have this little paper strip test.

14:08.140 --> 14:11.160
 This is enough to let you know if you're infectious.

14:11.160 --> 14:14.700
 With somewhere around the order of 99% sensitivity,

14:14.700 --> 14:18.100
 99% specificity, you can know

14:18.100 --> 14:20.820
 if you have infectious virus in you.

14:20.820 --> 14:23.220
 If we can get these out to everyone's homes,

14:23.220 --> 14:25.220
 build these, make 10 million, 20 million,

14:25.220 --> 14:26.820
 30 million of them a day.

14:26.820 --> 14:30.500
 You know, we make more bottles of Dasani water every day.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.500
 We can make these little paper strip tests.

14:33.500 --> 14:36.660
 And if we do that and we get these into people's homes

14:36.660 --> 14:39.060
 so that they can use them twice a week,

14:39.060 --> 14:41.980
 then we can know if we're infectious.

14:41.980 --> 14:43.140
 You know, is it perfect?

14:43.140 --> 14:44.060
 Absolutely not.

14:44.060 --> 14:45.140
 But is it near perfect?

14:45.140 --> 14:46.340
 Absolutely.

14:46.340 --> 14:48.540
 You know, and so if we can say,

14:48.540 --> 14:51.380
 hey, the transmission of this is, you know,

14:51.380 --> 14:54.720
 for every hundred people that get infected right now,

14:54.720 --> 14:57.980
 they go on to infect maybe 130 additional people.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.180
 And that's exponential growth.

14:59.180 --> 15:01.340
 So a hundred becomes 130.

15:01.340 --> 15:04.260
 A couple of days later that 130 becomes

15:04.260 --> 15:08.660
 another 165 people have now been infected.

15:08.660 --> 15:10.420
 And you know, go over three weeks

15:10.420 --> 15:13.940
 and a hundred people become 500 people infected.

15:13.940 --> 15:17.080
 Now it doesn't take much to have those hundred people

15:17.080 --> 15:19.760
 not infect 130, but infect 90.

15:20.760 --> 15:24.540
 All we have to do is remove say 30, 40% of new infections

15:24.540 --> 15:26.300
 from continuing their spread.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.060
 And then instead of exponential growth,

15:28.060 --> 15:30.060
 you have exponential decay.

15:30.060 --> 15:32.020
 So this doesn't need to be perfect.

15:32.020 --> 15:34.180
 We don't have to go from a hundred to zero.

15:34.180 --> 15:37.300
 We just have to go and have those hundred people infect 90

15:37.300 --> 15:40.660
 and those 90 people infect, you know, 82,

15:40.660 --> 15:41.820
 whatever it might be.

15:41.820 --> 15:43.760
 And you do that for a few weeks and boom,

15:43.760 --> 15:45.780
 you have now gone instead of a hundred to 500,

15:45.780 --> 15:48.060
 you've gone from a hundred to 20.

15:48.060 --> 15:49.740
 It's not very hard.

15:49.740 --> 15:53.220
 And so the way to do that is to let people know

15:54.300 --> 15:55.300
 that they're infectious.

15:55.300 --> 15:58.780
 I mean, we're a perfect example right now.

15:58.780 --> 16:02.340
 This morning I used these tests to make sure

16:02.340 --> 16:03.700
 that I wasn't infectious.

16:03.700 --> 16:04.540
 Is it perfect?

16:04.540 --> 16:06.900
 No, but it reduced my odds 99%.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.660
 I already was at extremely low odds

16:08.660 --> 16:11.520
 because I spend my life quarantining these days.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.780
 Well, the interesting thing with this test,

16:13.780 --> 16:15.040
 with the testing in general,

16:15.040 --> 16:17.380
 which is why I love what you've been espousing,

16:17.380 --> 16:20.220
 is it's really confusing to me that this has not been

16:20.220 --> 16:24.700
 taken on as it's one actual solution

16:24.700 --> 16:28.740
 that was available for a long time.

16:28.740 --> 16:33.740
 There doesn't seem to have been solutions proposed

16:33.780 --> 16:36.860
 at a large scale and a solution that it seems

16:36.860 --> 16:38.840
 like a lot of people would be able to get behind.

16:38.840 --> 16:43.840
 There's some politicization or fear of other solutions

16:44.240 --> 16:47.100
 that people have proposed, which is like lockdown.

16:47.100 --> 16:48.260
 And there's a worry, you know,

16:48.260 --> 16:50.740
 especially in the American spirit of freedom,

16:50.740 --> 16:52.640
 like you can't tell me what to do.

16:52.640 --> 16:56.980
 The thing about tests is it like empowers you

16:56.980 --> 16:59.100
 with information essentially.

16:59.100 --> 17:04.100
 So like it gives you more information about your,

17:06.180 --> 17:07.980
 like your role in this pandemic,

17:07.980 --> 17:10.420
 and then you can do whatever the hell you want.

17:10.420 --> 17:13.020
 Like it's all up to your ethics and so on.

17:13.020 --> 17:16.800
 So like, and it's obvious that with that information,

17:16.800 --> 17:19.500
 people would be able to protect their loved ones

17:19.500 --> 17:23.580
 and also do their sort of quote unquote duty

17:23.580 --> 17:25.000
 for their country, right?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.820
 Is protect the rest of the country.

17:26.820 --> 17:27.820
 That's exactly right.

17:27.820 --> 17:30.300
 I mean, it's just, it's empowerment,

17:30.300 --> 17:32.220
 but you know, this is a problem.

17:32.220 --> 17:35.280
 We have not put these into action in large part

17:35.280 --> 17:37.860
 because we have a medical industry

17:37.860 --> 17:40.200
 that doesn't want to see them be used.

17:40.200 --> 17:44.140
 We have a political and a regulatory industry

17:44.140 --> 17:45.620
 that doesn't want to see them be used.

17:45.620 --> 17:46.500
 That sounds crazy.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.820
 Why wouldn't they want them to be used?

17:48.820 --> 17:51.180
 We have a very paternalistic approach

17:51.180 --> 17:52.620
 to everything in this country.

17:52.620 --> 17:55.500
 You know, despite this country kind of being founded

17:55.500 --> 17:58.340
 on this individualistic ideal,

17:58.340 --> 18:01.420
 pull yourself up from your bootstraps, all that stuff.

18:01.420 --> 18:03.240
 When it comes to public health,

18:03.240 --> 18:08.240
 we have a bunch of ivory tower academics who want data.

18:09.300 --> 18:12.340
 They, you know, they want to see perfection.

18:12.340 --> 18:15.900
 And we have this issue of letting perfection

18:15.900 --> 18:19.500
 get in the way of actually doing something at all,

18:19.500 --> 18:21.500
 you know, doing something effective.

18:21.500 --> 18:25.080
 And so we keep comparing these tests, for example,

18:25.080 --> 18:27.980
 to the laboratory based PCR test.

18:27.980 --> 18:30.780
 And sure, this isn't a PCR test,

18:30.780 --> 18:32.440
 but this doesn't cost a hundred dollars

18:32.440 --> 18:34.740
 and it doesn't take five days to get back,

18:34.740 --> 18:36.780
 which means in every single scenario,

18:36.780 --> 18:38.860
 this is the more effective test.

18:38.860 --> 18:41.700
 And we have, unfortunately, a system

18:41.700 --> 18:42.940
 that's not about public health.

18:42.940 --> 18:47.940
 We have entirely eroded any ideals of public health

18:48.180 --> 18:51.340
 in our country for the biomedical complex,

18:51.340 --> 18:53.220
 you know, this medical industrial complex,

18:53.220 --> 18:55.260
 which overrides everything.

18:55.260 --> 18:57.060
 And that's why, you know, I'm just,

18:58.620 --> 18:59.700
 can I swear on this pot?

18:59.700 --> 19:00.540
 Yes.

19:00.540 --> 19:05.540
 I'm just so fucking pissed that these tests don't exist.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.460
 Meanwhile, and everyone says, you know,

19:08.460 --> 19:10.100
 oh, we couldn't make these, you know,

19:10.100 --> 19:11.180
 that we could never do it.

19:11.180 --> 19:14.380
 That would be such a hard, a difficult problem.

19:14.380 --> 19:16.260
 Meanwhile, the vaccine gets,

19:16.260 --> 19:18.740
 we have at the same time that we could have gotten

19:18.740 --> 19:22.020
 these stupid little paper strip tests out to every household,

19:22.020 --> 19:25.300
 we have developed a brand new vaccine.

19:25.300 --> 19:27.980
 We've gone through phase one, phase two, phase three trials.

19:27.980 --> 19:29.980
 We've scaled up its production.

19:29.980 --> 19:31.860
 And now we have UPS and FedEx

19:31.860 --> 19:33.800
 and all the logistics in the world,

19:33.800 --> 19:35.860
 getting freezers out to where they need to be.

19:35.860 --> 19:39.260
 We have this immense, we see when it comes to sort of

19:39.260 --> 19:42.380
 medicine, you know, something you're injecting into somebody,

19:42.380 --> 19:45.520
 then all of a sudden people say, oh, yes we can.

19:45.520 --> 19:48.640
 But you say, oh no, that's too simple a solution,

19:48.640 --> 19:49.740
 too cheap a solution.

19:49.740 --> 19:52.140
 No way could we possibly do that.

19:52.140 --> 19:54.020
 It's this faulty thinking in our country,

19:54.020 --> 19:58.340
 which, you know, frankly is driven by big money, big,

19:58.340 --> 20:00.740
 you know, the only time when we actually think

20:00.740 --> 20:03.460
 that we can do something that's maybe aggressive

20:03.460 --> 20:05.660
 and complicated is when there's billions and billions

20:05.660 --> 20:08.020
 of billions of dollars in it, you know.

20:08.020 --> 20:09.980
 I mean, on a difficult note, because this is part

20:09.980 --> 20:12.180
 of your work from before the COVID,

20:12.180 --> 20:15.820
 it does seem that I saw a statistic currently

20:15.820 --> 20:18.380
 is that 40% would not be taken,

20:18.380 --> 20:20.500
 of Americans would not be taking the vaccine,

20:20.500 --> 20:21.740
 some number like this.

20:21.740 --> 20:24.060
 So you also have to acknowledge that all the money

20:24.060 --> 20:26.980
 that's been invested, like there doesn't appear

20:26.980 --> 20:30.340
 to be a solution to deal with like the fear,

20:30.340 --> 20:32.260
 distrust that people have.

20:32.260 --> 20:34.700
 I bet, I don't know if you know this number,

20:34.700 --> 20:38.300
 but for taking a strip, like a rapid test like this,

20:38.300 --> 20:41.100
 I bet you people would say,

20:41.100 --> 20:43.060
 like the percentage of people that wouldn't take it

20:43.060 --> 20:45.260
 is in the single digits, probably.

20:45.260 --> 20:46.820
 I completely think so.

20:46.820 --> 20:48.060
 And you know, there's a lot of people

20:48.060 --> 20:50.420
 who don't want to get a test today.

20:50.420 --> 20:53.100
 And that's because it gets sent to a lab,

20:53.100 --> 20:55.820
 it gets reported, it has all this stuff.

20:55.820 --> 20:58.900
 And we're a country which teaches people

20:58.900 --> 21:01.060
 from the time they're babies, you know,

21:01.060 --> 21:04.500
 to keep their medical data close to them.

21:04.500 --> 21:05.900
 We have HIPAA, we have all these,

21:05.900 --> 21:07.700
 we have immense rules and regulations

21:07.700 --> 21:11.540
 to ensure the privacy of people's medical data.

21:11.540 --> 21:12.980
 And then a pandemic comes around

21:12.980 --> 21:15.540
 and we just assume that the average person

21:15.540 --> 21:17.580
 is gonna wipe all that away and say,

21:17.580 --> 21:20.540
 oh no, I'm happy giving out not just my own medical data,

21:20.540 --> 21:22.900
 but also to tell the authorities,

21:22.900 --> 21:24.340
 everyone who I've spent my time with,

21:24.340 --> 21:26.860
 so that they all get a call and are pissed at me

21:26.860 --> 21:28.100
 for giving up their names.

21:28.100 --> 21:29.860
 You know, so people aren't getting tested

21:29.860 --> 21:32.980
 and they're definitely not giving up their contacts

21:32.980 --> 21:34.860
 when it comes to contact tracing.

21:34.860 --> 21:37.740
 And so for so many reasons, that approach is failing.

21:38.980 --> 21:41.060
 Not to even mention the delays in testing

21:41.060 --> 21:41.900
 and things like that.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.500
 And so this is a whole different approach,

21:44.500 --> 21:46.940
 but it's an approach that empowers people

21:46.940 --> 21:51.220
 and takes the power a bit away from the people in charge.

21:51.220 --> 21:54.260
 You know, and that's what's really grating on,

21:54.260 --> 21:56.020
 I think, public health officials who say,

21:56.020 --> 21:57.420
 no, we need the data.

21:57.420 --> 22:00.540
 So they're effectively saying, if I can't have the data,

22:00.540 --> 22:02.180
 I don't want the individuals,

22:02.180 --> 22:04.740
 I don't want the public to have their own data either.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.660
 Which is a terrible approach to a pandemic

22:06.660 --> 22:09.820
 where we can't solve a public health crisis

22:09.820 --> 22:12.820
 without actively engaging the public.

22:13.700 --> 22:14.860
 It just doesn't work.

22:14.860 --> 22:17.460
 And you know, and that's what we're trying to do right now,

22:17.460 --> 22:19.180
 which is a terrible approach.

22:19.180 --> 22:20.580
 So first of all, there's a,

22:20.580 --> 22:22.420
 you have a really nice informative website,

22:22.420 --> 22:24.900
 rapidtest.org, with information on this.

22:24.900 --> 22:26.900
 I still can't believe this is not more popular.

22:26.900 --> 22:27.740
 It's ridiculous.

22:27.740 --> 22:32.740
 Okay, but our, one of the FAQs you have

22:32.980 --> 22:35.180
 is a rapid test too expensive.

22:35.180 --> 22:38.340
 So can cost be brought down?

22:38.340 --> 22:41.820
 Like I pay, I take a weekly PCR test

22:41.820 --> 22:46.180
 and I think I pay 160, 170 bucks a week.

22:46.180 --> 22:47.420
 No, I mean, it's criminal.

22:47.420 --> 22:49.380
 Absolutely we can get costs.

22:49.380 --> 22:53.260
 This thing right here costs less than a dollar to make.

22:53.260 --> 22:55.900
 With everything combined, plus the swabs,

22:55.900 --> 22:58.060
 you know, maybe it costs a dollar 50.

22:58.060 --> 23:02.580
 Could be sold for, frankly, it could be sold for $3

23:02.580 --> 23:04.740
 and still make a profit if they wanna sell it for five.

23:04.740 --> 23:08.940
 This one here, this is a slightly more complicated one,

23:08.940 --> 23:10.980
 but you can see it's just got

23:10.980 --> 23:13.740
 the exact same paper strip inside.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.780
 And this is really, it doesn't look like much,

23:15.780 --> 23:17.060
 but it's kind of the cream of the crop

23:17.060 --> 23:19.340
 in terms of these rapid tests.

23:19.340 --> 23:20.900
 This is the one that the US government bought

23:20.900 --> 23:23.260
 and it is doing an amazing job.

23:23.260 --> 23:27.620
 It has a 99.9% sensitivity and specificity.

23:27.620 --> 23:29.540
 So it's really, it's really good.

23:29.540 --> 23:31.860
 And so essentially the way it works is you just,

23:31.860 --> 23:34.180
 you use a swab, you put the,

23:34.180 --> 23:36.180
 once you kind of use a swab on yourself,

23:36.180 --> 23:39.020
 you put the swab into these little holes here.

23:39.020 --> 23:41.460
 You put some buffer on it and you close it

23:41.460 --> 23:43.940
 and a line will show up if it's positive

23:43.940 --> 23:45.780
 and a line won't show up if it's negative.

23:45.780 --> 23:48.500
 It takes five, 10 minutes.

23:48.500 --> 23:51.980
 This whole thing, this can be made so cheap

23:51.980 --> 23:54.660
 that the US government was able to buy them,

23:54.660 --> 23:59.660
 buy 150 million of them from Abbott for $5 a piece.

24:00.460 --> 24:03.220
 So anyone who says that these are expensive,

24:03.220 --> 24:05.140
 we have the proof is right here.

24:05.140 --> 24:10.140
 This one at its, Abbott did not lose money on this deal.

24:10.300 --> 24:14.820
 They got $750 million for selling 150 million of these

24:14.820 --> 24:15.940
 at five bucks a piece.

24:17.420 --> 24:20.460
 All of these tests can do the same.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.500
 So anyone who says that these should be,

24:22.500 --> 24:23.940
 unfortunately what's happening though

24:23.940 --> 24:25.860
 is the FDA is only authorizing

24:25.860 --> 24:28.380
 all of these tests as medical devices.

24:28.380 --> 24:32.340
 So what happens when you, if I'm a medical company,

24:32.340 --> 24:34.580
 if I'm a test production company

24:34.580 --> 24:37.260
 and I wanna make this test and I go through

24:37.260 --> 24:40.380
 and the FDA at the end of my authorization,

24:40.380 --> 24:45.180
 the FDA says, okay, you now have a medical device,

24:45.180 --> 24:47.880
 not a public health tool, but a medical device.

24:47.880 --> 24:50.700
 And that affords you the ability to charge

24:50.700 --> 24:52.060
 insurance companies for it.

24:53.540 --> 24:55.980
 Why would I ever as a, you know,

24:55.980 --> 25:00.980
 in our capitalistic economy and sort of infrastructure,

25:01.180 --> 25:03.540
 why would I ever not sell this for $30

25:03.540 --> 25:06.660
 when insurance will pay for it or $100?

25:06.660 --> 25:09.340
 You know, it might only cost me 50 cents to make,

25:09.340 --> 25:13.180
 but by pushing all of these tests through a medical pathway

25:13.180 --> 25:17.280
 at the FDA, what extrudes out the other side

25:17.280 --> 25:20.380
 is an expensive medical device that's erroneously expensive.

25:20.380 --> 25:22.900
 It doesn't need to be inflated in cost,

25:22.900 --> 25:27.100
 but the companies say, well, I'd rather make fewer of them

25:27.100 --> 25:30.340
 and just sell them all for $30 a piece

25:30.340 --> 25:34.000
 than make tens of millions of them, which I could do,

25:34.000 --> 25:39.000
 and sell them at a dollar marginal profit.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.740
 And so it's a problem with our whole medical industry

25:43.740 --> 25:46.420
 that we see tests only as medical devices

25:46.420 --> 25:49.340
 and what I would like to see is for the government

25:49.340 --> 25:51.740
 in the same way that they bought 150 million of these

25:51.740 --> 25:55.660
 from Abbott, they should be buying, you know,

25:55.660 --> 25:59.140
 all of these tests, they should be buying 20 million a day

25:59.140 --> 26:00.700
 and getting them out to people's homes.

26:00.700 --> 26:03.060
 This virus has cost trillions of dollars

26:03.060 --> 26:05.020
 to the American people.

26:05.020 --> 26:07.740
 It's closed down restaurants and stores

26:07.740 --> 26:09.820
 and obviously the main streets across America

26:09.820 --> 26:11.820
 have shuttered.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.460
 It's killing people, it's killing our economy,

26:14.460 --> 26:17.940
 it's killing lifestyles and lives.

26:17.940 --> 26:19.220
 This is an obvious solution.

26:19.220 --> 26:20.300
 To me, this is exciting.

26:20.300 --> 26:21.760
 This is like, this is a solution.

26:21.760 --> 26:25.660
 I wish like in April or something like that

26:25.660 --> 26:30.660
 to launch like the larger scale manufacturing deployment

26:30.860 --> 26:33.320
 of tests.

26:33.320 --> 26:35.180
 Doesn't matter what test they are.

26:35.180 --> 26:37.020
 It's obviously the capitalist system

26:37.020 --> 26:38.940
 would create cheaper and cheaper tests

26:38.940 --> 26:42.340
 that would be hopefully driving down to $1.

26:42.340 --> 26:43.940
 So what are we talking about?

26:43.940 --> 26:46.100
 In America, there's, I don't know,

26:46.100 --> 26:49.180
 300 plus million people.

26:49.180 --> 26:53.260
 So that means you wanna be testing regularly, right?

26:54.140 --> 26:57.500
 So how many do you think is possible to manufacture?

26:57.500 --> 27:00.820
 What would be the ultimate goal to manufacture per month?

27:00.820 --> 27:03.980
 Yep, so if we wanna slow this virus

27:03.980 --> 27:05.700
 and actually stop it from transmitting,

27:05.700 --> 27:07.380
 achieve what I call herd effects.

27:07.380 --> 27:09.980
 Like vaccine herd immunity,

27:09.980 --> 27:13.180
 herd effects are when you get that R value below one

27:13.180 --> 27:14.700
 through preventing onward transmission.

27:14.700 --> 27:15.980
 If we wanna do that with these tests,

27:15.980 --> 27:19.060
 we need about 20 million to 40 million of them every day,

27:20.580 --> 27:21.580
 which is not a lot.

27:21.580 --> 27:22.420
 In the United States.

27:22.420 --> 27:23.580
 In the United States.

27:23.580 --> 27:24.540
 So we could do it.

27:24.540 --> 27:25.360
 There's other ways.

27:25.360 --> 27:29.220
 You can have two people in a household swab each other,

27:29.220 --> 27:31.080
 swab themselves rather,

27:31.080 --> 27:33.520
 and then mix, put the swabs into the same tube

27:33.520 --> 27:35.400
 and onto one test so you can pool.

27:35.400 --> 27:40.340
 So you can get a two or three X gain in efficiency

27:40.340 --> 27:42.380
 through pooling in the household.

27:42.380 --> 27:44.300
 You could do that in schools or offices too,

27:44.300 --> 27:45.580
 wherever and just use a swab.

27:45.580 --> 27:47.780
 You have a, there's two people.

27:47.780 --> 27:50.240
 I mean, even if it's just standing in line

27:50.240 --> 27:52.580
 at a public testing site or something,

27:52.580 --> 27:53.800
 you could just say, okay,

27:53.800 --> 27:57.020
 these two are the last people to test or swab themselves.

27:57.020 --> 27:58.600
 They go into one thing.

27:58.600 --> 27:59.940
 And if it comes back positive,

27:59.940 --> 28:02.140
 then you just do each person and it's rapid.

28:02.140 --> 28:05.560
 So you can just say to the people, one of you is positive.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.660
 Let's test you again.

28:07.960 --> 28:10.540
 So there's ways to get the efficiency gains much better.

28:10.540 --> 28:13.700
 But let's say, I think that the optimal number right now

28:13.700 --> 28:16.780
 that matches sort of what we can produce more or less today,

28:16.780 --> 28:19.040
 if we want it, is 20 million a day.

28:19.040 --> 28:20.580
 Right now, one company that,

28:20.580 --> 28:21.740
 I don't have their test here,

28:21.740 --> 28:24.880
 but one company is already producing 5 million tests

28:24.880 --> 28:27.780
 themselves and shipping them overseas.

28:27.780 --> 28:30.940
 It's an American company based in California called Inova,

28:30.940 --> 28:34.980
 and they are giving 5 million tests to the UK every day.

28:36.400 --> 28:39.100
 Not to the, you know, and this is just because there's no,

28:39.100 --> 28:42.180
 the federal government hasn't authorized these tests.

28:42.180 --> 28:44.680
 So without the support of the government.

28:44.680 --> 28:46.240
 So yeah, so essentially,

28:46.240 --> 28:49.220
 if the government just puts some support behind it,

28:49.220 --> 28:53.980
 then yeah, you can get 20 million, probably easy.

28:53.980 --> 28:55.340
 Oh yeah, this, I mean, just here,

28:55.340 --> 28:57.500
 I have three different companies.

28:57.500 --> 28:58.660
 These, they all look similar.

28:58.660 --> 28:59.500
 Well, this one's closed,

28:59.500 --> 29:02.220
 but these are three different companies right here.

29:02.220 --> 29:04.020
 This is a fourth, Abbott.

29:04.020 --> 29:05.580
 Now, this is a fifth.

29:05.580 --> 29:07.100
 This is a sixth.

29:07.100 --> 29:08.660
 These two are a little bit different.

29:08.660 --> 29:10.060
 Do you mind if in a little bit,

29:10.060 --> 29:11.660
 would you take some of these or?

29:11.660 --> 29:12.860
 Yeah, let's do it.

29:12.860 --> 29:15.540
 We can absolutely do them.

29:15.540 --> 29:17.860
 So you have a lot of tests in front of you.

29:17.860 --> 29:20.100
 Could you maybe explain some of them?

29:20.100 --> 29:21.300
 Absolutely.

29:21.300 --> 29:24.360
 So there's a few different classes of tests

29:24.360 --> 29:26.040
 that I just have here, and there's more tests.

29:26.040 --> 29:28.880
 There's many more different tests out in the world too.

29:28.880 --> 29:31.460
 These are one class of tests.

29:31.460 --> 29:33.700
 These are rapid antigen tests

29:33.700 --> 29:36.780
 that are just the most bare bones paper strip tests.

29:36.780 --> 29:41.780
 These are, this is the type that I wanna see produced

29:42.060 --> 29:43.940
 in the tens of millions every day.

29:43.940 --> 29:45.460
 It's so simple.

29:45.460 --> 29:47.500
 You don't even need the plastic cartridge.

29:47.500 --> 29:52.180
 You can just make the paper strip,

29:52.180 --> 29:55.340
 and you could have a little tube like this

29:55.340 --> 29:57.660
 that you just dunk the paper strip into.

29:57.660 --> 30:00.100
 You don't actually need the plastic,

30:00.100 --> 30:01.320
 which I'd actually prefer,

30:01.320 --> 30:03.440
 because if we start making tens of millions of these,

30:03.440 --> 30:05.340
 this becomes a lot of waste.

30:05.340 --> 30:07.420
 So I'd rather not see this kind of waste be out there.

30:07.420 --> 30:08.660
 And there's a few companies,

30:08.660 --> 30:11.560
 Quidel is making a test called the Quick View,

30:11.560 --> 30:12.880
 which is just this.

30:12.880 --> 30:16.500
 It's a, they've gotten rid of all the plastic.

30:16.500 --> 30:18.380
 And for people who are just listening to this,

30:18.380 --> 30:20.460
 we're looking at some very small tests

30:20.460 --> 30:22.260
 that fit in the palm of your hand,

30:22.260 --> 30:24.300
 and they're basically paper strips

30:24.300 --> 30:26.320
 fit into different containers.

30:26.320 --> 30:29.620
 And that's hence the comment about the plastic containers.

30:29.620 --> 30:32.140
 These are just injection molded, I think.

30:32.140 --> 30:34.440
 And they're, you know,

30:34.440 --> 30:36.900
 they can build them at high numbers,

30:36.900 --> 30:38.940
 but then they have to like place them in there appropriately

30:38.940 --> 30:39.780
 and all this stuff.

30:39.780 --> 30:41.420
 So it is a bottleneck,

30:41.420 --> 30:44.300
 or somewhat of a bottleneck in manufacturing.

30:44.300 --> 30:47.260
 The actual bottleneck, which the government, I think,

30:47.260 --> 30:49.860
 should use the Defense Productions Act to build up,

30:49.860 --> 30:52.740
 is there's a nitrocellulose membrane,

30:52.740 --> 30:54.480
 a laminated membrane on this,

30:54.480 --> 30:57.220
 that allows the material,

30:57.220 --> 31:02.220
 the buffer with the swab mixture to flow across it.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.280
 So the way these work,

31:03.280 --> 31:05.180
 they're called lateral flow tests.

31:05.180 --> 31:07.220
 And you take a swab,

31:07.220 --> 31:10.040
 you swab the front of your nose,

31:10.040 --> 31:12.880
 you dunk that swab into some buffer,

31:12.880 --> 31:15.540
 and then you put a couple of drops of that buffer

31:15.540 --> 31:17.460
 onto the lateral flow.

31:17.460 --> 31:19.060
 And just like paper,

31:19.060 --> 31:21.820
 if you dip a piece of paper into a cup of water,

31:21.820 --> 31:25.000
 the paper will pull the water up through capillary action.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.340
 This actually works very similarly.

31:26.340 --> 31:29.700
 It flows through somewhat a capillary action

31:29.700 --> 31:32.260
 through this nitrocellulose membrane.

31:32.260 --> 31:33.860
 And there's little antibodies on there,

31:33.860 --> 31:36.140
 these little proteins that are very specific,

31:36.140 --> 31:39.380
 in this case, for antigens or proteins of the virus.

31:39.380 --> 31:42.740
 So these are antibodies similar to the antibodies

31:42.740 --> 31:45.660
 that our body makes from our immune system,

31:45.660 --> 31:48.380
 but they're just printed on these lateral flow tests,

31:48.380 --> 31:50.580
 and they're printed just like a little, a line.

31:50.580 --> 31:54.580
 So then you slice these all up into individual ones.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.660
 And if there's any virus on that buffer,

31:56.660 --> 31:59.860
 as it flows across, the antibodies grab that virus,

31:59.860 --> 32:03.220
 and it creates a little reaction with some colloids in here

32:03.220 --> 32:04.900
 that cause it to turn dark.

32:04.900 --> 32:06.440
 Just like a pregnancy test,

32:07.420 --> 32:11.540
 one line means negative, it means a control strip worked,

32:11.540 --> 32:13.060
 and two lines mean positive.

32:13.060 --> 32:16.060
 It means, you know, if you get two lines,

32:16.060 --> 32:17.100
 it just means you have virus there.

32:17.100 --> 32:18.580
 You're very, very likely to have virus there.

32:18.580 --> 32:21.520
 And so they're super simple.

32:21.520 --> 32:23.900
 It is the exact same technology as pregnancy tests.

32:23.900 --> 32:27.940
 It's the technology, this particular one from Abbott,

32:27.940 --> 32:31.020
 this has been used for other infectious diseases

32:31.020 --> 32:34.300
 like malaria, and actually a number of these companies

32:34.300 --> 32:37.480
 have made malaria tests that do the exact same thing.

32:37.480 --> 32:41.260
 So they just coopted the same form factor

32:41.260 --> 32:43.340
 and just changed the antibodies

32:43.340 --> 32:46.580
 so it picks up SARS CoV2 instead of other infections.

32:46.580 --> 32:48.740
 Is it also, the Abbott one, is it also a strip?

32:48.740 --> 32:51.020
 Yep, yeah, this Abbott one here is,

32:51.020 --> 32:52.140
 there's the, in this case,

32:52.140 --> 32:53.700
 instead of being put in a plastic sheath,

32:53.700 --> 32:56.900
 it's just put in a cardboard thing and literally glued on.

32:56.900 --> 32:59.780
 I mean, it looks like nothing, you know, it's just,

32:59.780 --> 33:02.620
 it looks like a, like,

33:02.620 --> 33:04.860
 I mean, it's just the simplest thing you could imagine.

33:04.860 --> 33:07.580
 The exterior packaging looks very Apple like, it's nice.

33:07.580 --> 33:09.420
 It does, yeah, yeah.

33:09.420 --> 33:11.820
 Yeah, so it's nice when it comes in a,

33:11.820 --> 33:14.820
 this is how they're packaged, you know,

33:14.820 --> 33:17.980
 so, and they don't have to, you know,

33:17.980 --> 33:20.340
 these are coming in individual packages against,

33:20.340 --> 33:21.900
 again, because they're really considered

33:21.900 --> 33:24.180
 individual medical devices,

33:24.180 --> 33:27.020
 but you could package them in bigger packets and stuff.

33:27.020 --> 33:28.740
 You wanna be careful with humidity

33:28.740 --> 33:30.260
 so they all have a little,

33:30.260 --> 33:33.540
 one of those humidity removing things

33:33.540 --> 33:35.060
 and oxygen removing things.

33:36.020 --> 33:39.940
 So that's, this is one class, these antigen tests.

33:39.940 --> 33:42.580
 If we could just pause for a second, if it's okay,

33:42.580 --> 33:47.580
 and could you just briefly say what is an antigen test

33:47.740 --> 33:49.580
 and what other tests there are out there,

33:49.580 --> 33:50.900
 like categories of tests?

33:50.900 --> 33:51.740
 Sure.

33:51.740 --> 33:52.700
 Just really quick.

33:52.700 --> 33:55.180
 So the testing landscape is a little bit complicated,

33:55.180 --> 33:56.900
 but it's, but I'll break it down.

33:56.900 --> 34:00.060
 There's really just three major classes of tests.

34:00.900 --> 34:02.780
 We'll start with the first two.

34:02.780 --> 34:06.300
 The first two tests are just looking for the virus

34:06.300 --> 34:10.060
 or looking for antibodies against the virus.

34:10.060 --> 34:12.540
 So we've heard about serology tests,

34:12.540 --> 34:14.540
 or maybe some people have heard about it.

34:14.540 --> 34:15.860
 Those are a different kind of test.

34:15.860 --> 34:19.220
 They're looking to see has somebody in the past,

34:19.220 --> 34:21.460
 does somebody have an immune response against the virus,

34:21.460 --> 34:23.220
 which would indicate that they were infected

34:23.220 --> 34:24.740
 or exposed to it.

34:24.740 --> 34:26.780
 So we're not talking about the antibody tests.

34:26.780 --> 34:27.820
 I'll just leave it at that.

34:27.820 --> 34:31.740
 Those, they actually can look very similar to this,

34:31.740 --> 34:35.380
 or they can be done in a laboratory.

34:35.380 --> 34:37.580
 Those are usually done from blood

34:37.580 --> 34:40.580
 and they're looking for an immune response to the virus.

34:40.580 --> 34:41.740
 So that's one.

34:41.740 --> 34:43.020
 Everything I'm talking about here

34:43.020 --> 34:44.660
 is looking for the virus itself,

34:44.660 --> 34:46.940
 not the immune response to the virus.

34:46.940 --> 34:49.100
 And so there's two ways to look for the virus.

34:49.100 --> 34:51.300
 You can either look for the genetic code of the virus,

34:51.300 --> 34:55.460
 like the RNA, just like the DNA of somebody's human cells,

34:55.460 --> 34:57.380
 or you can look for the proteins themselves,

34:57.380 --> 34:59.740
 the antigens of the virus.

34:59.740 --> 35:02.380
 So I like to differentiate them.

35:02.380 --> 35:07.380
 If you were a PCR test that looks for RNA in,

35:08.740 --> 35:10.900
 let's say if we made it against humans,

35:10.900 --> 35:13.060
 it would be looking for the DNA inside of our cells.

35:13.060 --> 35:15.660
 That would be actually looking for our genetic code.

35:16.500 --> 35:19.060
 The equivalent to an antigen test

35:19.060 --> 35:21.980
 is sort of a test that like actually is looking

35:21.980 --> 35:25.420
 for our eyes or our nose or physical features of our body

35:25.420 --> 35:30.420
 that would delineate, okay, this is Michael, for example.

35:30.420 --> 35:33.620
 And so you're either looking for a sequence

35:33.620 --> 35:35.940
 or you're looking for a structure.

35:35.940 --> 35:38.620
 The PCR tests that a lot of people have gotten now

35:38.620 --> 35:40.620
 and they're done in labs usually

35:40.620 --> 35:43.620
 are looking for the sequence of the virus, which is RNA.

35:43.620 --> 35:46.940
 This test here by a company called Detect,

35:46.940 --> 35:49.340
 this is one of Jonathan Rothberg's companies.

35:50.380 --> 35:54.180
 He's the guy who helped create modern day sequencing

35:54.180 --> 35:56.020
 and all kinds of other things.

35:56.020 --> 35:58.820
 So this Detect device, that's the name of the company,

35:58.820 --> 36:01.980
 this is actually a rapid RNA detection device.

36:01.980 --> 36:04.140
 So it's almost, it's like a PCR like test

36:04.140 --> 36:06.100
 and we could even do it here.

36:06.100 --> 36:09.100
 It's really, it's a beautiful test in my opinion,

36:09.100 --> 36:10.940
 works exceedingly well.

36:10.940 --> 36:12.380
 It's gonna be a little bit more expensive.

36:12.380 --> 36:14.180
 So I think it could confirm,

36:14.180 --> 36:16.460
 could be used as a confirmatory test for these.

36:16.460 --> 36:18.140
 Is there a greater accuracy to it?

36:19.740 --> 36:21.780
 Yes, I would say that there is a greater accuracy.

36:21.780 --> 36:23.940
 There's also a downfall though of PCR

36:23.940 --> 36:26.460
 and tests that look for RNA.

36:26.460 --> 36:29.940
 They can sometimes detect somebody

36:29.940 --> 36:32.340
 who is no longer infectious.

36:32.340 --> 36:33.900
 So you have the RNA test

36:33.900 --> 36:35.780
 and then you have these antigen tests.

36:35.780 --> 36:37.860
 The antigen tests look for structures,

36:37.860 --> 36:40.580
 but they're generally only going to turn positive

36:40.580 --> 36:43.580
 if people have actively replicating virus in them.

36:43.580 --> 36:48.260
 And so what happens after an infection dissipates,

36:48.260 --> 36:51.260
 you've just gone from having sort of a spike.

36:51.260 --> 36:53.500
 So if you get infected, maybe three days later,

36:53.500 --> 36:56.220
 the virus gets into exponential growth

36:56.220 --> 36:59.060
 and it can replicate to trillions of viruses

36:59.060 --> 37:00.820
 inside the body.

37:00.820 --> 37:02.900
 Your immune system then kind of tackles it

37:02.900 --> 37:04.900
 and beats it down to nothing.

37:04.900 --> 37:07.180
 But what ends up in the wake of that,

37:07.180 --> 37:08.020
 you just had a battle.

37:08.020 --> 37:10.340
 You had this massive battle that just took place

37:10.340 --> 37:12.900
 inside your upper respiratory tract.

37:12.900 --> 37:16.180
 And because of that, you've had trillions and trillions

37:16.180 --> 37:19.660
 of viruses go to zero, essentially.

37:19.660 --> 37:21.540
 But the RNA is still there.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.020
 It's just these remnants.

37:23.020 --> 37:24.820
 In the same way that if you go to a crime scene

37:24.820 --> 37:28.820
 and blood was sort of spread all over the crime scene,

37:28.820 --> 37:30.740
 you're going to find a lot of DNA.

37:30.740 --> 37:31.580
 There's tons of DNA.

37:31.580 --> 37:35.220
 There's no people anymore, but there's a lot of DNA there.

37:35.220 --> 37:36.340
 Same thing happens here.

37:36.340 --> 37:38.660
 And so what's happening with PCR testing

37:38.660 --> 37:42.460
 is when people go and use these exceedingly high sensitivity

37:42.460 --> 37:46.820
 PCR tests, people will stay positive for weeks or months

37:46.820 --> 37:49.700
 after their infection has subsided,

37:49.700 --> 37:51.540
 which has caused a lot of problems, in my opinion.

37:51.540 --> 37:54.900
 It's problems that the CDC and the FDA and doctors

37:54.900 --> 37:56.780
 don't want to deal with.

37:56.780 --> 37:58.140
 But I've tried to publish on it.

37:58.140 --> 38:01.660
 I've tried to suggest that this is an issue,

38:01.660 --> 38:02.980
 both to New York Times and others.

38:02.980 --> 38:04.620
 And now it's unfortunately kind of taken

38:04.620 --> 38:06.700
 on a life of its own of conspiracy theorists

38:06.700 --> 38:10.020
 thinking that they call it a case demic.

38:10.020 --> 38:13.420
 They say, oh, you know, PCR is detecting people

38:13.420 --> 38:16.020
 who are no longer, who are false positive.

38:16.020 --> 38:17.340
 They're not false positives.

38:17.340 --> 38:20.780
 They're late positives, no longer transmissible.

38:20.780 --> 38:25.100
 I think the way you, like what I saw in rapidtest.org,

38:25.100 --> 38:27.180
 I really liked the distinction between diagnostic

38:27.180 --> 38:30.060
 sensitivity and contagiousness sensitivity.

38:30.060 --> 38:35.060
 That's, it's so, that website is so obvious

38:36.380 --> 38:38.220
 that it's painful because it's like, yeah,

38:38.220 --> 38:41.020
 that's what we should be talking about is

38:41.020 --> 38:46.020
 how accurately is a test able to detect your contagiousness?

38:46.260 --> 38:48.980
 And you have different plots that show that actually

38:48.980 --> 38:52.780
 there's, you know, that antigen tests,

38:52.780 --> 38:55.540
 the tests we're looking at today, like rapid tests,

38:55.540 --> 38:58.460
 are actually really good at detecting contagiousness.

38:58.460 --> 38:59.300
 Absolutely.

38:59.300 --> 39:02.420
 It all mixes back with this whole idea that,

39:02.420 --> 39:04.500
 of the medical industrial complex.

39:04.500 --> 39:07.540
 You know, in this country, and in most countries,

39:07.540 --> 39:10.900
 we have almost entirely defunded

39:10.900 --> 39:13.900
 and devalued public health, period.

39:13.900 --> 39:15.660
 You know, we just have.

39:15.660 --> 39:20.060
 And what that means is that we don't even,

39:20.060 --> 39:22.100
 we don't have a language for it.

39:22.100 --> 39:23.340
 We don't have a lexicon for it.

39:23.340 --> 39:25.860
 We don't have a regulatory landscape for it.

39:25.860 --> 39:30.140
 And so the only window we have to look at a test today

39:30.140 --> 39:32.780
 is as a medical diagnostic test.

39:32.780 --> 39:37.060
 And that becomes very problematic when we're trying

39:37.060 --> 39:40.100
 to tackle a public health threat

39:40.100 --> 39:42.100
 and a public health emergency.

39:42.100 --> 39:44.660
 By definition, this is a public health emergency

39:44.660 --> 39:45.900
 that we're in.

39:45.900 --> 39:48.820
 And yet we keep evaluating tests

39:48.820 --> 39:52.780
 as though the diagnostic benchmark is the gold standard.

39:52.780 --> 39:55.660
 Where if I'm a physician, I am a physician,

39:55.660 --> 39:59.260
 so I'll put on that physician hat for a moment.

39:59.260 --> 40:01.740
 And if I have a patient who comes to me

40:01.740 --> 40:06.740
 and wants to know if their symptoms are a result of them

40:06.740 --> 40:10.060
 having COVID, then I want every shred of evidence

40:10.060 --> 40:12.780
 that I can get to see, does this person currently

40:12.780 --> 40:17.260
 or did they recently have this infection inside of them?

40:17.260 --> 40:21.220
 And so in that sense, the PCR test is the perfect test.

40:21.220 --> 40:22.940
 It's really sensitive.

40:22.940 --> 40:25.100
 It will find the RNA if it's there at all

40:25.100 --> 40:26.940
 so that I could say, you know, yeah,

40:26.940 --> 40:28.820
 you have a low amount of RNA left.

40:28.820 --> 40:30.860
 You might've been, you said your symptoms

40:30.860 --> 40:32.380
 started two weeks ago.

40:32.380 --> 40:36.100
 You probably were infectious two weeks ago

40:36.100 --> 40:38.980
 and you have lingering symptoms from it.

40:38.980 --> 40:41.540
 But that's a medical diagnosis.

40:41.540 --> 40:44.580
 It's kind of like a detective recreating a crime scene.

40:44.580 --> 40:48.420
 They wanna go back there and recreate the pieces

40:48.420 --> 40:52.860
 so that they can assign blame or whatever it might be.

40:52.860 --> 40:53.820
 But that's not public health.

40:53.820 --> 40:56.020
 In public health, we need to only look forward.

40:56.020 --> 40:57.260
 We don't wanna go back and say,

40:57.260 --> 40:59.540
 well, was this person, are there symptoms

40:59.540 --> 41:01.780
 because they had an infection two weeks ago?

41:01.780 --> 41:04.820
 In public health, we just wanna stop the virus

41:04.820 --> 41:06.260
 from spreading to the next person.

41:06.260 --> 41:08.900
 And so that's where we don't care

41:08.900 --> 41:11.620
 if somebody was infected two weeks ago.

41:11.620 --> 41:13.580
 We only care about finding the people

41:13.580 --> 41:15.860
 who are infectious today.

41:15.860 --> 41:19.780
 And unfortunately, our regulatory landscape

41:19.780 --> 41:23.860
 fails to apply that knowledge

41:23.860 --> 41:26.100
 to evaluate these tests as public health tools.

41:26.100 --> 41:29.220
 They're only evaluating the tests as medical tools.

41:29.220 --> 41:32.660
 And therefore, we get all kinds of complaints

41:32.660 --> 41:37.540
 that say this test, which detects 99 plus,

41:37.540 --> 41:41.460
 99.8% of current infectious people,

41:43.620 --> 41:45.340
 by the FDA's rubric, they'll say,

41:45.340 --> 41:48.460
 no, no, it's only 50% sensitive.

41:48.460 --> 41:50.460
 And that's because when you go out into the world

41:50.460 --> 41:53.620
 and you just compare this against PCR positivity,

41:53.620 --> 41:56.820
 most people who are PCR positive in the world right now

41:56.820 --> 42:00.500
 at any given time are post infectious.

42:00.500 --> 42:01.660
 They're no longer infectious

42:01.660 --> 42:04.940
 because you might only be infectious for five days,

42:04.940 --> 42:06.700
 but then you'll remain PCR positive

42:06.700 --> 42:09.180
 for three or four or five weeks.

42:09.180 --> 42:11.340
 And so when you go and just evaluate these tests

42:11.340 --> 42:13.980
 and you say, okay, this person's PCR positive,

42:13.980 --> 42:17.140
 does the rapid antigen test detect that?

42:17.140 --> 42:19.020
 More often than not, it's no.

42:19.020 --> 42:23.020
 But that's because those people don't need isolation.

42:23.020 --> 42:24.100
 They're post infectious.

42:24.100 --> 42:27.780
 And it's become much more of a problem

42:27.780 --> 42:31.300
 than I think even the FDA themself is recognizing

42:31.300 --> 42:33.500
 because they are unwilling at this point

42:33.500 --> 42:37.100
 to look at this as a public health problem

42:37.100 --> 42:38.820
 requiring public health tools.

42:38.820 --> 42:41.060
 We'll definitely talk about this a little bit more

42:41.060 --> 42:43.380
 because the concern I have is that

42:43.380 --> 42:45.340
 a bigger pandemic comes along.

42:45.340 --> 42:47.100
 What are the lessons we draw from this

42:47.100 --> 42:48.020
 and how we move forward?

42:48.020 --> 42:50.060
 Let's talk about that in a bit.

42:50.060 --> 42:55.060
 But sort of, can we discuss further the lay of the land here

42:55.220 --> 42:56.940
 of the different tests before us?

42:56.940 --> 42:57.780
 Absolutely.

42:57.780 --> 43:00.900
 So I talked about PCR tests and those are done in the lab

43:00.900 --> 43:05.180
 or they're done essentially with a rapid test like this,

43:05.180 --> 43:07.820
 the detect, and we can even try this in a moment.

43:07.820 --> 43:09.380
 It goes into a little heater.

43:09.380 --> 43:11.340
 So you might have one of these in a household

43:11.340 --> 43:14.420
 or one of these in a nursing home or something like that

43:14.420 --> 43:15.340
 or in an airport.

43:16.460 --> 43:19.380
 Or you could have one that has 100 different outlets.

43:19.380 --> 43:21.340
 This is just to heat the tube up.

43:21.340 --> 43:22.620
 These are the rapid tests.

43:22.620 --> 43:25.620
 They're super simple, no frills.

43:25.620 --> 43:30.620
 You just swab your nose and you put the swab into a buffer

43:30.860 --> 43:32.180
 and you put the buffer on the test.

43:32.180 --> 43:34.340
 So we can use these right now if you want.

43:34.340 --> 43:35.180
 We can try it out.

43:35.180 --> 43:36.820
 And all the tests we're talking about,

43:36.820 --> 43:39.900
 they're usually swabbing the nose.

43:39.900 --> 43:41.100
 Like that's the...

43:41.100 --> 43:43.220
 That's still the main, yeah.

43:43.220 --> 43:45.940
 There are some saliva tests coming about

43:45.940 --> 43:48.180
 and these can all work potentially with saliva.

43:48.180 --> 43:50.180
 They just have to be recalibrated.

43:50.180 --> 43:52.740
 But these swabs are really not bad.

43:52.740 --> 43:57.180
 This isn't the deep swab that goes like way back

43:57.180 --> 43:58.380
 into your nose or anything.

43:58.380 --> 44:01.900
 This is just a swab that you do yourself

44:01.900 --> 44:03.820
 like right in the front of your nose.

44:03.820 --> 44:04.660
 So if you wanna do it.

44:04.660 --> 44:05.620
 Yeah, do you mind if I?

44:05.620 --> 44:06.820
 Sure, yeah.

44:06.820 --> 44:08.140
 Yeah, why don't we start with this one?

44:08.140 --> 44:10.660
 Because this is Abbott's Buy Next Now test

44:10.660 --> 44:12.620
 and it's really, it's pretty simple.

44:12.620 --> 44:15.740
 This is the swab from the Abbott test.

44:15.740 --> 44:16.580
 That's correct.

44:16.580 --> 44:18.420
 That's the swab from the Abbott test.

44:18.420 --> 44:21.500
 So what I'm gonna do to start

44:21.500 --> 44:23.980
 is I'm going to take this buffer here,

44:23.980 --> 44:26.340
 which is, this is just the buffer

44:26.340 --> 44:27.940
 that goes onto this test.

44:27.940 --> 44:28.780
 So this is a brand new one.

44:28.780 --> 44:30.780
 I just opened this test out.

44:32.100 --> 44:34.820
 I'm gonna just take six drops of this buffer

44:34.820 --> 44:36.940
 and put it right onto this test here.

44:40.020 --> 44:43.540
 Two, three, four, five, six.

44:43.540 --> 44:44.380
 Okay.

44:44.380 --> 44:46.900
 And now you're gonna take that swab, open it up.

44:48.100 --> 44:50.940
 Yep, and now just wipe it around inside the,

44:50.940 --> 44:52.380
 into the front of your nose.

44:52.380 --> 44:54.900
 Do a few circles on each nostril.

44:58.260 --> 44:59.100
 That looks good.

45:03.660 --> 45:05.380
 This always makes me wanna sneeze.

45:05.380 --> 45:06.220
 Yeah.

45:07.100 --> 45:09.540
 Okay, now I'm gonna have you do it yourself.

45:11.860 --> 45:13.500
 I'm getting emotional.

45:13.500 --> 45:14.940
 Hold it parallel to the test.

45:14.940 --> 45:16.260
 So put the test down on the table.

45:16.260 --> 45:19.020
 Yep, and then go into that bottom hole.

45:19.020 --> 45:20.180
 Yep, and push forward

45:20.180 --> 45:22.820
 so that you can start to see it in the other hole.

45:22.820 --> 45:23.660
 There you go.

45:23.660 --> 45:26.460
 Now turn, if it's, once it hits up against the top,

45:26.460 --> 45:28.060
 just turn it three times.

45:28.060 --> 45:30.980
 One, two, three, and sort of, yep.

45:30.980 --> 45:32.980
 And now you just close,

45:32.980 --> 45:35.300
 so pull off that adhesive sticker there.

45:37.140 --> 45:39.060
 And now you just close the whole thing.

45:41.460 --> 45:42.820
 And.

45:42.820 --> 45:43.980
 And that's it.

45:43.980 --> 45:44.820
 That's it.

45:44.820 --> 45:46.180
 Now what we will see

45:46.180 --> 45:49.180
 is we will see a line form.

45:49.180 --> 45:53.140
 What's happening now is the buffer that you put in there

45:53.140 --> 45:58.140
 is now moving up onto the paper strip test,

45:58.820 --> 46:02.820
 and it has the material from the swab in there.

46:02.820 --> 46:05.420
 And so what we'll see is a line will form,

46:05.420 --> 46:07.340
 and that's gonna be the control line.

46:08.220 --> 46:11.540
 And then we'll also see the,

46:11.540 --> 46:14.940
 ideally we'll see no line for the actual line.

46:14.940 --> 46:17.660
 We'll see no line for the actual test line.

46:17.660 --> 46:20.300
 And that's because you should be negative.

46:20.300 --> 46:24.260
 So one line will be positive and two lines will be negative.

46:24.260 --> 46:25.100
 That's very cool.

46:25.100 --> 46:27.420
 There's this purple thing creeping up

46:28.860 --> 46:30.500
 onto the control line.

46:31.740 --> 46:32.580
 That's perfect.

46:32.580 --> 46:34.140
 That's what you wanna be seeing.

46:35.300 --> 46:36.780
 So you want to see that,

46:37.860 --> 46:41.220
 so right now you essentially want to see

46:41.220 --> 46:45.740
 that that blue line turns pink or purply color.

46:45.740 --> 46:49.220
 There's a blue line that's already there printed.

46:49.220 --> 46:52.660
 It should turn sort of a purple pink color.

46:52.660 --> 46:57.660
 And ideally there will be no additional line for the sample.

47:00.620 --> 47:02.260
 And if there is,

47:02.260 --> 47:06.700
 that's the 99 point whatever percent accuracy on,

47:06.700 --> 47:09.140
 that means I have, I'm contagious.

47:09.140 --> 47:11.180
 That would mean that you're likely contagious

47:11.180 --> 47:14.220
 or you likely have infectious virus in you.

47:14.220 --> 47:15.060
 What we can do,

47:15.060 --> 47:19.500
 because one of the things that my plan calls for

47:19.500 --> 47:21.540
 is because sometimes these tests

47:21.540 --> 47:24.620
 can get false positive results, it's rare.

47:24.620 --> 47:27.620
 Maybe 1% or in the case of this Binex now,

47:27.620 --> 47:30.180
 this Abbott test 0.1%.

47:30.180 --> 47:31.940
 So one in a thousand, one in 500,

47:31.940 --> 47:34.420
 something like that can be falsely positive.

47:34.420 --> 47:38.060
 What I recommend is that when somebody is positive

47:38.060 --> 47:39.300
 on one of these,

47:39.300 --> 47:41.300
 you turn around and you immediately test

47:41.300 --> 47:42.380
 on a different test.

47:42.380 --> 47:43.420
 You could either do it on the same,

47:43.420 --> 47:45.620
 but for good measure,

47:45.620 --> 47:48.220
 you want to use a separate test

47:48.220 --> 47:51.380
 that is somewhat orthogonal,

47:51.380 --> 47:54.180
 meaning that it shouldn't turn falsely positive

47:54.180 --> 47:56.100
 for the same reason.

47:56.100 --> 47:58.140
 This particular test here,

47:58.140 --> 48:02.020
 this detect test because it is looking for the RNA

48:02.020 --> 48:03.580
 and not the antigen,

48:03.580 --> 48:05.740
 this is an amazingly accurate test

48:05.740 --> 48:09.420
 and it's sort of a perfect gold standard

48:09.420 --> 48:12.780
 or confirmatory test for any of these antigen tests.

48:12.780 --> 48:14.820
 So one of the recommendations that I've had,

48:14.820 --> 48:17.820
 especially if people start using antigen tests

48:17.820 --> 48:20.100
 before you get onto a plane

48:20.100 --> 48:22.860
 or as what I call entrance screening,

48:22.860 --> 48:24.620
 if somebody is positive,

48:24.620 --> 48:26.380
 you don't immediately tell them,

48:26.380 --> 48:28.740
 you're positive, go isolate for 10 days.

48:28.740 --> 48:31.980
 You tell them, let's confirm on one of these,

48:31.980 --> 48:33.260
 on a detect test.

48:33.260 --> 48:36.660
 That is because it's completely orthogonal,

48:36.660 --> 48:39.420
 it's looking for the RNA instead of the antigen.

48:40.420 --> 48:43.580
 There's no reason, no biological reason

48:43.580 --> 48:46.340
 that both of these should be falsely positive.

48:47.500 --> 48:50.540
 So if one's falsely positive and the other one is negative,

48:50.540 --> 48:52.780
 especially because this one's more sensitive,

48:53.740 --> 48:56.940
 then I would trust this as a confirmatory test.

48:56.940 --> 49:00.420
 If this one's negative, then the antigen test

49:00.420 --> 49:02.220
 would be considered falsely positive.

49:02.220 --> 49:04.180
 It does look like there's only a single line,

49:04.180 --> 49:05.580
 so this is very exciting news.

49:05.580 --> 49:06.500
 That's right, yep.

49:06.500 --> 49:10.940
 It says wait 15 minutes to see both lines,

49:10.940 --> 49:14.100
 but in general, if somebody's really gonna be positive,

49:14.100 --> 49:17.180
 that line starts showing up within a minute or two.

49:17.180 --> 49:18.420
 So you wanna keep the whole,

49:18.420 --> 49:20.380
 we'll keep watching it for the whole 15 minutes

49:20.380 --> 49:22.740
 as it's sitting there, but I would say

49:22.740 --> 49:25.740
 you're knowing that you've had PCR tests recently

49:25.740 --> 49:26.900
 and all that.

49:26.900 --> 49:27.980
 The odds are pretty good.

49:27.980 --> 49:28.820
 The odds are very good.

49:28.820 --> 49:30.780
 The packaging, very iPhone like.

49:30.780 --> 49:33.660
 I'm digging the sexy packaging.

49:33.660 --> 49:36.020
 I'm a sucker for good packaging, okay.

49:36.020 --> 49:37.740
 So then there's this test here,

49:37.740 --> 49:41.500
 which is, this is another, it's funny.

49:41.500 --> 49:42.860
 Let me open this up and show you.

49:42.860 --> 49:44.300
 This is a really nice test.

49:44.300 --> 49:45.620
 It's another antigen test.

49:45.620 --> 49:48.220
 Works the exact same way as this, essentially,

49:48.220 --> 49:51.100
 but what you can see is it's got lights in it

49:51.100 --> 49:52.260
 and a power button and stuff.

49:52.260 --> 49:57.260
 This is called an allume test, which is fine,

49:57.980 --> 49:59.900
 and it's a really nice test, to be honest,

49:59.900 --> 50:04.020
 but it has to pair with an iPhone.

50:04.020 --> 50:05.660
 And so it's good as a,

50:05.660 --> 50:07.580
 I think that this is gonna become,

50:08.740 --> 50:11.740
 there's a lot of use for this from a medical perspective,

50:11.740 --> 50:13.020
 where you want good reporting.

50:13.020 --> 50:15.940
 This can, because it pairs with an iPhone,

50:15.940 --> 50:19.380
 it can immediately send the report

50:19.380 --> 50:20.420
 to a department of health,

50:20.420 --> 50:23.340
 whereas these paper strip tests, they're just paper.

50:23.340 --> 50:26.580
 They don't report anything unless you wanna report it.

50:26.580 --> 50:28.860
 Okay, so I'm gonna just pick it apart.

50:28.860 --> 50:32.180
 And so you can see is there's fluorescent readers

50:32.180 --> 50:34.700
 and little lasers and LEDs and stuff in there.

50:34.700 --> 50:37.140
 You can actually see the lights going off.

50:37.140 --> 50:39.380
 And there's a paper strip test right inside there,

50:39.380 --> 50:41.380
 but you can see that there's a whole circuit board

50:41.380 --> 50:44.380
 and all this stuff, right?

50:44.380 --> 50:48.100
 And so this is the kind of thing

50:48.100 --> 50:50.420
 that the FDA is looking for,

50:52.340 --> 50:54.780
 for home use and things like that,

50:54.780 --> 50:56.420
 because it's kind of foolproof.

50:56.420 --> 50:58.340
 You can't go wrong with it.

50:58.340 --> 51:00.580
 It pairs with an iPhone, so you need Bluetooth.

51:00.580 --> 51:01.780
 So it's gonna be more limited.

51:01.780 --> 51:03.180
 It's a great test, don't get me wrong.

51:03.180 --> 51:05.220
 It's as good as any of these.

51:05.220 --> 51:08.420
 But when you compare this thing with a battery

51:08.420 --> 51:10.900
 and a circuit board and all this stuff,

51:10.900 --> 51:14.100
 it's got its purpose, but it's not a public health tool.

51:14.100 --> 51:17.020
 I don't wanna see this made in the tens of millions a day

51:17.020 --> 51:17.940
 and thrown away.

51:18.860 --> 51:19.700
 This is just.

51:19.700 --> 51:20.540
 But FDA likes that kind of stuff.

51:20.540 --> 51:22.020
 FDA loves this stuff,

51:22.020 --> 51:23.980
 because they can't get it out of their mind

51:23.980 --> 51:26.020
 that this is a public health crisis.

51:26.020 --> 51:29.340
 We need, I mean, just look at the difference here.

51:29.340 --> 51:32.060
 Something with flashing lights is essential.

51:32.060 --> 51:34.020
 It's got batteries, it's got a Bluetooth thing.

51:34.020 --> 51:36.620
 It's a great test, but to be honest,

51:36.620 --> 51:39.780
 it's not any better than this one.

51:39.780 --> 51:42.460
 And so I want this one.

51:43.380 --> 51:44.380
 It's nice and all.

51:44.380 --> 51:46.460
 The form factor is nice,

51:46.460 --> 51:49.020
 and it's really nice that it goes to Bluetooth.

51:49.020 --> 51:52.980
 But it goes against the principle of just 20 million a day.

51:52.980 --> 51:54.900
 The easy solution, everybody has it.

51:54.900 --> 51:57.580
 You can manufacture and probably,

51:57.580 --> 52:00.060
 you could've probably scaled this up in a couple of weeks.

52:00.060 --> 52:00.900
 Oh, absolutely.

52:00.900 --> 52:04.220
 These companies, I mean, the rest of the world has these.

52:04.220 --> 52:05.300
 They can be scaled up.

52:05.300 --> 52:06.700
 They already exist.

52:06.700 --> 52:08.100
 You know, SD biosensors,

52:08.100 --> 52:10.460
 one company's making tens of millions a day,

52:10.460 --> 52:11.860
 not coming to the United States,

52:11.860 --> 52:13.420
 but going all over Europe,

52:13.420 --> 52:16.980
 going all over Southeast Asia and East Asia.

52:16.980 --> 52:17.900
 So they exist.

52:17.900 --> 52:21.100
 The US is just, you know, we can't get out of our own way.

52:21.100 --> 52:22.380
 I wonder why somebody,

52:22.380 --> 52:23.620
 I don't know if you were paying attention,

52:23.620 --> 52:26.860
 but somebody like an Elon Musk type character.

52:26.860 --> 52:28.460
 So he was really into doing

52:28.460 --> 52:30.580
 some like obvious engineering solution,

52:30.580 --> 52:33.980
 like this at home rapid test

52:33.980 --> 52:37.220
 seems like a very Elon Musk thing to do.

52:37.220 --> 52:38.140
 I don't know if you saw,

52:38.140 --> 52:41.820
 but I had a little Twitter conversation with Elon Musk.

52:41.820 --> 52:43.420
 Does he not like, what is he,

52:43.420 --> 52:45.500
 do you know what his thoughts are on rapid testing?

52:45.500 --> 52:47.180
 Well, he was using a slightly different one,

52:47.180 --> 52:49.180
 one of these, but that requires an instrument

52:49.180 --> 52:50.860
 called the BD Veritor.

52:50.860 --> 52:52.020
 And he got a false positive,

52:52.020 --> 52:53.020
 or no, I shouldn't say,

52:53.020 --> 52:54.580
 he didn't necessarily get a false positive.

52:54.580 --> 52:55.900
 He got discrepant results.

52:55.900 --> 52:57.860
 He did this test four times.

52:57.860 --> 52:59.700
 He got two positives, two negatives,

53:00.780 --> 53:02.260
 but then he got a PCR test

53:02.260 --> 53:05.020
 and it was a very low positive result.

53:05.020 --> 53:07.940
 So I think what happened is he just tested himself

53:07.940 --> 53:09.060
 at the tail end of an,

53:09.060 --> 53:11.060
 this was actually right before he was about to send those.

53:11.060 --> 53:12.700
 It was the day of essentially that he was sending

53:12.700 --> 53:15.060
 the astronauts up to the space station the other day.

53:15.060 --> 53:17.740
 So he was using these rapid tests

53:17.740 --> 53:20.020
 cause he wanted to make sure that he was good to go in

53:20.020 --> 53:23.100
 and he got discrepant results.

53:23.100 --> 53:25.140
 Ultimately they were correct,

53:25.140 --> 53:26.860
 but two were negative, two were positive.

53:26.860 --> 53:30.660
 But what really happened once he shared his PCR results

53:30.660 --> 53:32.820
 and they were very low positive.

53:32.820 --> 53:34.540
 So really what was happening is,

53:34.540 --> 53:37.100
 my guess is he found himself right at the edge

53:37.100 --> 53:39.900
 of his positivity, of his infectiousness.

53:39.900 --> 53:42.500
 And so the test worked how it was supposed to work.

53:42.500 --> 53:45.740
 It probably had he used it two days earlier,

53:45.740 --> 53:47.420
 it would have been screaming positive.

53:47.420 --> 53:49.460
 He wouldn't have gotten discrepant results,

53:49.460 --> 53:51.140
 but he found himself right at the edge

53:51.140 --> 53:52.780
 by the time he used the test.

53:52.780 --> 53:55.060
 So the PCR would always pick it up

53:55.060 --> 53:57.340
 cause it's still, cause that will still stay positive

53:57.340 --> 53:59.100
 then for weeks potentially.

53:59.100 --> 54:02.660
 But the rapid antigen test was starting to falter,

54:02.660 --> 54:03.740
 not in a bad way,

54:03.740 --> 54:06.860
 but just he probably was really no longer

54:06.860 --> 54:07.860
 particularly infectious.

54:07.860 --> 54:10.740
 And so it was kind of when it gets to be a very low viral

54:10.740 --> 54:12.740
 load, it becomes stochastic.

54:12.740 --> 54:14.380
 It's fascinating this duality.

54:14.380 --> 54:18.420
 So one you can think from an individual perspective,

54:18.420 --> 54:23.060
 it's unclear when you take four and half are positive,

54:23.060 --> 54:25.660
 half are negative, like what are you supposed to do?

54:25.660 --> 54:28.100
 But from a societal perspective,

54:28.100 --> 54:30.900
 it seems like if just one of them is positive,

54:30.900 --> 54:34.580
 just stay home for a couple of days, for a while.

54:34.580 --> 54:36.180
 So when you're a CEO of a company,

54:36.180 --> 54:38.020
 you're launching astronauts to space,

54:38.020 --> 54:43.020
 you may not want to rely absolutely on the antigen test

54:43.180 --> 54:47.380
 as a thing by which you steer your decisions

54:47.380 --> 54:50.420
 of like 10,000 plus people companies.

54:50.420 --> 54:53.780
 But us individuals just living in the world,

54:53.780 --> 54:56.140
 if you can, if it comes up positive,

54:57.020 --> 54:59.340
 then you make decisions based on that.

54:59.340 --> 55:01.980
 And then that scales really nicely to an entire society

55:01.980 --> 55:03.620
 of hundreds of millions of people.

55:03.620 --> 55:07.420
 And that's how you get that virus to stop spreading.

55:07.420 --> 55:08.300
 That's exactly right.

55:08.300 --> 55:10.420
 You don't have to catch every single one.

55:10.420 --> 55:12.700
 And the nice thing is that these will,

55:12.700 --> 55:15.740
 these will catch the people who are most infectious.

55:15.740 --> 55:19.140
 So with Elon Musk, it generally that test,

55:19.140 --> 55:20.460
 we don't have the counterfactual.

55:20.460 --> 55:23.260
 We don't have his results from three days earlier

55:23.260 --> 55:25.220
 when he was probably most infectious.

55:26.180 --> 55:30.020
 But my guess is the fact that it was catching two

55:30.020 --> 55:33.220
 out of the four, even when he was down at a CT value

55:33.220 --> 55:36.740
 of really, really very, very low viral load on the PCR test

55:36.740 --> 55:38.660
 suggests that it was doing its job.

55:39.900 --> 55:42.220
 And you just wanna, and the nice thing is

55:42.220 --> 55:45.820
 because these can be produced at such scale,

55:45.820 --> 55:49.140
 getting one positive doesn't immediately have to mean

55:49.140 --> 55:51.740
 10 days of isolation.

55:51.740 --> 55:55.620
 That's the CDC is more conservative stance to say,

55:55.620 --> 55:57.580
 if you're positive on any tests,

55:57.580 --> 55:59.180
 stay home for 10 days and isolate.

55:59.180 --> 56:01.740
 But here, people would just have more tests.

56:01.740 --> 56:04.540
 So the recommendation should be test daily.

56:04.540 --> 56:06.900
 If you turn positive, test daily

56:06.900 --> 56:09.220
 until you've been negative for 24, 48 hours

56:09.220 --> 56:10.180
 and then go back to work.

56:10.180 --> 56:12.820
 And the nice thing there is right now,

56:12.820 --> 56:13.980
 people just aren't testing

56:13.980 --> 56:15.700
 because they don't wanna take 10 days off.

56:15.700 --> 56:16.940
 They're not getting paid for it.

56:16.940 --> 56:18.540
 So they can't take 10 days off.

56:18.540 --> 56:21.820
 Do you know what Elon thinks about this idea

56:21.820 --> 56:23.340
 of rapid testing for everybody?

56:23.340 --> 56:26.660
 So I understood I need to look at that whole Twitter thread.

56:26.660 --> 56:29.740
 So I understand his perhaps criticism of,

56:30.860 --> 56:34.660
 he had like a conspiratorial tone from my vague look at it

56:34.660 --> 56:37.900
 of like, what's going on here with these tests?

56:37.900 --> 56:40.340
 But what does he actually think about

56:40.340 --> 56:42.980
 this very practical to me engineering solution

56:42.980 --> 56:45.100
 of just deploying rapid tests to everybody?

56:45.100 --> 56:48.540
 It seems like that's a way to open up the economy in April.

56:48.540 --> 56:49.380
 Well, to be honest,

56:49.380 --> 56:51.460
 I've been trying to get in touch with him again.

56:51.460 --> 56:54.900
 I think, take somebody like Elon Musk

56:54.900 --> 56:57.740
 with the engineering prowess within his ranks,

56:57.740 --> 57:02.740
 to easily, easily build these at the tens of millions a day.

57:04.380 --> 57:07.100
 He could build the machines from scratch.

57:07.100 --> 57:08.180
 A lot of the companies,

57:08.180 --> 57:12.820
 they buy the machines from South Korea or Taiwan, I believe.

57:12.820 --> 57:15.060
 We don't have to, we can build these machines.

57:15.060 --> 57:16.980
 They're simple to build.

57:16.980 --> 57:20.180
 Put somebody like Elon Musk on it,

57:20.180 --> 57:21.980
 take some of his best engineers and say,

57:21.980 --> 57:26.900
 look, the US needs a solution in two weeks.

57:26.900 --> 57:29.060
 Build these machines, figure it out.

57:29.060 --> 57:30.100
 He'll do it, he could do it.

57:30.100 --> 57:33.060
 This is a guy who is literally,

57:33.060 --> 57:37.820
 he has started multiple entirely new industries.

57:37.820 --> 57:40.820
 He has the capital to do it without the US government

57:40.820 --> 57:41.860
 if he wanted to.

57:41.860 --> 57:43.500
 And you know what, it would,

57:43.500 --> 57:47.500
 the return on investment for him would be huge.

57:47.500 --> 57:50.420
 But frankly, the return on investment in the country

57:50.420 --> 57:53.500
 would be hundreds of billions of dollars,

57:53.500 --> 57:55.620
 because it means we could get society open.

57:55.620 --> 57:58.740
 So I know that his first experience

57:58.740 --> 58:01.620
 with these rapid tests was confusing,

58:01.620 --> 58:04.300
 which is how I ended up having this Twitter

58:04.300 --> 58:06.980
 kind of conversation with him very briefly.

58:06.980 --> 58:09.380
 But I think that if he understood

58:09.380 --> 58:11.060
 sort of a little bit more, and I think he does,

58:11.060 --> 58:13.340
 I really love to talk to him about it,

58:13.340 --> 58:14.980
 because I think he could totally change

58:14.980 --> 58:17.340
 the course of this pandemic in the United States,

58:17.340 --> 58:18.420
 single handedly.

58:18.420 --> 58:19.980
 He loves grand things.

58:19.980 --> 58:24.700
 Yeah, I think out of all the solutions I've seen,

58:24.700 --> 58:29.700
 this is the obvious engineering solution

58:29.700 --> 58:32.860
 to at least a pandemic of this scale.

58:32.860 --> 58:35.340
 I love that you say the engineering solution.

58:35.340 --> 58:38.100
 So this is something I've been really trying to,

58:38.100 --> 58:42.700
 I'm an engineer, my previous history was all engineering,

58:42.700 --> 58:44.620
 and that's really how I think.

58:44.620 --> 58:46.700
 I then went into medicine and PhD world,

58:46.700 --> 58:51.700
 but I think that the world,

58:52.180 --> 58:53.940
 like one of the major catastrophes,

58:53.940 --> 58:55.340
 or one of the major problems,

58:55.340 --> 58:57.980
 is that we have physicians making the decisions

58:57.980 --> 59:01.300
 about public health and a pandemic,

59:01.300 --> 59:03.300
 when really we need engineers.

59:03.300 --> 59:05.220
 This is an engineering problem.

59:05.220 --> 59:06.580
 And so what I've been trying to do,

59:06.580 --> 59:10.500
 I actually really want to start a whole new field

59:10.500 --> 59:12.860
 called public health engineering.

59:12.860 --> 59:15.220
 And so I've been, eventually I want to try

59:15.220 --> 59:16.940
 to bring it to MIT and get MIT

59:16.940 --> 59:19.260
 to want to start a new department or something.

59:19.260 --> 59:21.540
 That's a doubly awesome idea.

59:21.540 --> 59:22.380
 Yeah.

59:22.380 --> 59:24.940
 That, this is really, okay.

59:24.940 --> 59:26.660
 I love this, I love every aspect.

59:26.660 --> 59:29.820
 I love everything you're talking about.

59:29.820 --> 59:30.900
 A lot of people believe,

59:30.900 --> 59:34.460
 because vaccines started being deployed currently,

59:34.460 --> 59:38.140
 that we are no longer in need of a solution.

59:39.460 --> 59:44.460
 We're no longer in need of slowing the spread of the virus.

59:45.340 --> 59:46.500
 To me, as I understand,

59:46.500 --> 59:49.700
 it seems like this is the most important time

59:49.700 --> 59:52.500
 to have something like a rapid testing solution.

59:52.500 --> 59:54.620
 Can you kind of break that apart?

59:54.620 --> 59:57.060
 What's the role of rapid testing currently

59:57.060 --> 1:00:01.580
 in the next, what is it, three, four months maybe?

1:00:01.580 --> 1:00:02.940
 Even more.

1:00:02.940 --> 1:00:05.620
 The vaccine rollout isn't gonna be as peachy

1:00:05.620 --> 1:00:07.940
 as everyone is hoping.

1:00:07.940 --> 1:00:09.420
 And I hate to be the Debbie Downer here,

1:00:09.420 --> 1:00:13.540
 but there's a lot of unknowns with this vaccine.

1:00:13.540 --> 1:00:14.620
 You've already mentioned one,

1:00:14.620 --> 1:00:16.100
 which is there's a lot of people

1:00:16.100 --> 1:00:18.060
 who just don't want to get the vaccine.

1:00:19.220 --> 1:00:21.420
 I hope that that might change as things move forward

1:00:21.420 --> 1:00:23.060
 and people see their neighbors getting it

1:00:23.060 --> 1:00:25.580
 and their family getting it and it's safe and all.

1:00:25.580 --> 1:00:27.580
 We don't know how effective the vaccine is gonna be

1:00:27.580 --> 1:00:28.620
 after two or three months.

1:00:28.620 --> 1:00:30.900
 We've only measured it in the first two or three months,

1:00:30.900 --> 1:00:33.180
 which is a massive problem,

1:00:33.180 --> 1:00:35.100
 which we can go into biologically,

1:00:35.100 --> 1:00:38.180
 because there's very good reasons to believe

1:00:38.180 --> 1:00:40.100
 that the efficacy could fall way down

1:00:40.100 --> 1:00:41.500
 after two or three months.

1:00:42.420 --> 1:00:44.540
 We don't know if it's gonna stop transmission.

1:00:44.540 --> 1:00:46.940
 And if it doesn't stop transmission,

1:00:46.940 --> 1:00:48.340
 then there's, you know,

1:00:48.340 --> 1:00:50.820
 herd immunity is much, much more difficult to get

1:00:50.820 --> 1:00:53.540
 because that's all based on transmission blockade.

1:00:54.580 --> 1:00:57.580
 And frankly, we don't know how easily

1:00:57.580 --> 1:00:58.860
 we're going to be able to roll it out.

1:00:58.860 --> 1:01:01.580
 Some of the vaccines need really significant cold chains,

1:01:01.580 --> 1:01:04.580
 have very short half lives outside of that cold chain.

1:01:05.700 --> 1:01:10.300
 We need to organize massive numbers of people

1:01:10.300 --> 1:01:11.420
 to be able to distribute these.

1:01:11.420 --> 1:01:14.740
 Most hospitals today are saying that they're not equipped

1:01:14.740 --> 1:01:16.060
 to hire the right people

1:01:16.060 --> 1:01:19.140
 to be even administering enough of these vaccines.

1:01:19.140 --> 1:01:20.220
 And then a lot of the hospitals

1:01:20.220 --> 1:01:22.140
 are frustrated because they're getting much lower,

1:01:22.140 --> 1:01:24.860
 smaller allocations than they were expecting.

1:01:24.860 --> 1:01:28.860
 So I think right now, like you say,

1:01:28.860 --> 1:01:30.500
 right now is the best time,

1:01:31.540 --> 1:01:34.460
 you know, besides three or four or five or six months ago,

1:01:34.460 --> 1:01:38.020
 right now is the best time to get these rapid tests out.

1:01:38.020 --> 1:01:39.860
 And we need to, I mean,

1:01:39.860 --> 1:01:42.380
 the country has the capacity to build them.

1:01:42.380 --> 1:01:45.340
 We have, we're shipping them overseas right now.

1:01:45.340 --> 1:01:47.020
 We just need to flip a switch,

1:01:47.020 --> 1:01:48.460
 get the FDA to recognize

1:01:48.460 --> 1:01:51.460
 that there's more important things than diagnostic medicine,

1:01:51.460 --> 1:01:54.860
 which is the effectiveness of the public health program

1:01:54.860 --> 1:01:57.300
 when we're dealing with a pandemic.

1:01:57.300 --> 1:02:00.540
 They need to authorize these as public health tools,

1:02:00.540 --> 1:02:04.180
 or, you know, frankly, the president could,

1:02:05.700 --> 1:02:08.540
 you know, there's a lot of other ways to get these tests

1:02:08.540 --> 1:02:09.660
 to not have to go through

1:02:09.660 --> 1:02:11.740
 the normal FDA authorization program,

1:02:11.740 --> 1:02:15.940
 but maybe have the NIH and the CDC give a stamp of approval.

1:02:15.940 --> 1:02:19.100
 And if we could, we could get these out tomorrow.

1:02:19.100 --> 1:02:20.700
 And that's where that article came from,

1:02:20.700 --> 1:02:23.500
 you know, how we can stop the spread of this virus

1:02:23.500 --> 1:02:26.900
 by Christmas, we could, you know, now it's getting late.

1:02:26.900 --> 1:02:30.180
 And so we have to keep updating that timeframe,

1:02:30.180 --> 1:02:32.060
 maybe putting Christmas in the title wasn't,

1:02:32.060 --> 1:02:33.580
 I should have said how we can stop

1:02:33.580 --> 1:02:35.540
 the spread of this virus in a month.

1:02:35.540 --> 1:02:37.220
 It would be a little bit more timeless,

1:02:37.220 --> 1:02:40.620
 but we could do it, you know, we really could do it.

1:02:40.620 --> 1:02:43.700
 And that's the most frustrating part here is that

1:02:43.700 --> 1:02:46.460
 we're just choosing not to as a country.

1:02:46.460 --> 1:02:48.820
 We're choosing to bankrupt our society

1:02:48.820 --> 1:02:52.980
 because some people at the FDA and other places

1:02:52.980 --> 1:02:54.980
 just can't seem to get their head around the fact

1:02:54.980 --> 1:02:56.460
 that this is a public health problem,

1:02:56.460 --> 1:02:58.140
 not a bunch of medical problems.

1:02:58.140 --> 1:03:00.500
 Is there a way to change that policy wise?

1:03:00.500 --> 1:03:03.260
 So this is a much bigger thing that you're speaking to,

1:03:03.260 --> 1:03:08.260
 which I love in terms of the MIT engineering approach

1:03:09.780 --> 1:03:11.500
 to public health.

1:03:11.500 --> 1:03:13.260
 Is there a way to push this?

1:03:13.260 --> 1:03:14.980
 Is this a political thing?

1:03:14.980 --> 1:03:17.580
 Like where some Andrew Yang type characters

1:03:17.580 --> 1:03:20.420
 need to like start screaming about it?

1:03:20.420 --> 1:03:24.380
 Is it more of an Elon Musk thing

1:03:24.380 --> 1:03:26.100
 where people just need to build it

1:03:26.100 --> 1:03:28.780
 and then on Twitter start talking crap

1:03:28.780 --> 1:03:31.320
 to politicians for not doing it?

1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:34.820
 What are the ideas here?

1:03:34.820 --> 1:03:37.140
 I think it's a little of both.

1:03:37.140 --> 1:03:38.860
 I think it's political on the one hand,

1:03:38.860 --> 1:03:41.100
 and I've certainly been talking to Congress a lot,

1:03:41.100 --> 1:03:42.420
 talking to senators.

1:03:42.420 --> 1:03:43.380
 Are they receptive?

1:03:43.380 --> 1:03:44.220
 Oh, yeah.

1:03:44.220 --> 1:03:45.360
 I mean, that's the crazy thing.

1:03:45.360 --> 1:03:47.900
 Everyone but the FDA is receptive.

1:03:47.900 --> 1:03:49.240
 I mean, it's astounding.

1:03:49.240 --> 1:03:53.380
 I mean, I advise, informally I advise the president

1:03:53.380 --> 1:03:55.740
 and the president elects teams.

1:03:55.740 --> 1:03:59.820
 I talk to Congress, I talk to senators, governors,

1:04:01.140 --> 1:04:05.020
 and then all the way down to mayors of towns and things.

1:04:05.020 --> 1:04:08.900
 And I mean, months ago I held a round table discussion

1:04:08.900 --> 1:04:12.100
 with Mayor Garcetti, who's the mayor of LA,

1:04:12.100 --> 1:04:15.340
 and I brought all the companies who make these things.

1:04:15.340 --> 1:04:17.140
 This was in like July or August or something.

1:04:17.140 --> 1:04:18.540
 I brought all the companies to the table

1:04:18.540 --> 1:04:21.180
 and said, okay, how can we get these out?

1:04:21.180 --> 1:04:23.500
 And unfortunately, it went nowhere

1:04:23.500 --> 1:04:25.860
 because the FDA won't authorize them

1:04:25.860 --> 1:04:27.140
 as public health tools.

1:04:28.980 --> 1:04:31.100
 The nice thing is that this is one of the nice

1:04:31.100 --> 1:04:32.040
 and frustrating things.

1:04:32.040 --> 1:04:35.180
 This is one of the few bipartisan things that I know of.

1:04:35.180 --> 1:04:38.340
 And like you said, it's a real solution.

1:04:38.340 --> 1:04:40.220
 Lockdowns aren't a solution.

1:04:40.220 --> 1:04:45.220
 They're an emergency bandaid to a catastrophe

1:04:45.820 --> 1:04:46.960
 that's currently happening.

1:04:46.960 --> 1:04:48.140
 They're not a solution.

1:04:48.140 --> 1:04:51.060
 And they're definitely not a public health solution

1:04:51.060 --> 1:04:53.240
 if we're taking a more holistic view of public health,

1:04:53.240 --> 1:04:55.700
 which includes people's wellbeing,

1:04:55.700 --> 1:04:57.460
 includes their psychological wellbeing,

1:04:57.460 --> 1:04:59.620
 their financial wellbeing.

1:04:59.620 --> 1:05:01.400
 Just stopping a virus if it means

1:05:01.400 --> 1:05:03.840
 that all those other things get thrown under the bus

1:05:03.840 --> 1:05:05.680
 is not a public health solution.

1:05:05.680 --> 1:05:10.680
 It's a myopic or very tunnel visioned approach

1:05:11.380 --> 1:05:14.460
 to a virus that's spreading.

1:05:14.460 --> 1:05:19.460
 This is a simple solution with essentially no downfall.

1:05:20.340 --> 1:05:22.060
 There is nothing bad about this.

1:05:22.060 --> 1:05:25.500
 It's just giving people a result.

1:05:25.500 --> 1:05:27.580
 And it's bipartisan.

1:05:27.580 --> 1:05:30.540
 The most conservative and the most liberal people,

1:05:30.540 --> 1:05:32.500
 everyone just wants to know their status.

1:05:32.500 --> 1:05:35.700
 Nobody wants to have to wait in line for four hours

1:05:35.700 --> 1:05:38.440
 to find out their status on Monday,

1:05:39.380 --> 1:05:40.860
 a week later, on Saturday.

1:05:40.860 --> 1:05:41.980
 It just doesn't make any sense.

1:05:41.980 --> 1:05:43.700
 It's a useless test at that point.

1:05:43.700 --> 1:05:45.460
 And everyone recognizes that.

1:05:45.460 --> 1:05:49.380
 So why do you think, like the mayor of LA,

1:05:49.380 --> 1:05:52.340
 why do you think politicians are going for these,

1:05:54.540 --> 1:05:58.060
 from my perspective, like kind of half ass lockdowns,

1:05:58.060 --> 1:06:01.440
 which is not, so I have seen good evidence

1:06:01.440 --> 1:06:04.700
 that like a complete lockdown can work,

1:06:04.700 --> 1:06:07.740
 but that's in theory, it's just like communism in theory

1:06:07.740 --> 1:06:08.580
 can work.

1:06:09.540 --> 1:06:12.100
 Like theoretically speaking, but it just doesn't,

1:06:12.100 --> 1:06:14.740
 at least in this country, we don't,

1:06:14.740 --> 1:06:17.180
 I think it's just impossible to have complete lockdown.

1:06:17.180 --> 1:06:21.900
 And still politicians are going for these kind of lockdowns

1:06:21.900 --> 1:06:24.020
 that everybody hates,

1:06:24.020 --> 1:06:27.300
 that's really hurting small businesses.

1:06:28.420 --> 1:06:29.260
 Like why are they going for that?

1:06:29.260 --> 1:06:32.700
 And big businesses, and yeah, all businesses,

1:06:32.700 --> 1:06:35.660
 but like basically not just hurting,

1:06:35.660 --> 1:06:38.660
 they're destroying small businesses, right?

1:06:38.660 --> 1:06:43.380
 Which is going to have potentially, I mean,

1:06:43.380 --> 1:06:47.300
 yeah, I've been reading as I don't shut up

1:06:47.300 --> 1:06:49.780
 about the rise and fall of the Third Reich,

1:06:49.780 --> 1:06:54.780
 and there's economic effects that take a decade to,

1:06:57.420 --> 1:06:58.940
 there's going to be long lasting effects

1:06:58.940 --> 1:07:02.460
 that may be destructive to the very fabric of this nation.

1:07:02.460 --> 1:07:04.500
 So why are they doing it,

1:07:04.500 --> 1:07:06.260
 and why are they not using the solution?

1:07:06.260 --> 1:07:07.700
 Is there any intuition?

1:07:07.700 --> 1:07:11.680
 I mean, you've said that FDA has a stranglehold, I guess,

1:07:11.680 --> 1:07:14.820
 on this whole public health problem.

1:07:14.820 --> 1:07:16.260
 Is that all it is?

1:07:16.260 --> 1:07:20.100
 That's honestly, it's pretty much all it is.

1:07:20.100 --> 1:07:23.700
 The companies, so somebody like Mayor Garcetti

1:07:23.700 --> 1:07:27.780
 or Governor Baker, Cuomo, Newsom,

1:07:27.780 --> 1:07:31.860
 any of these, DeWine, I've talked to a lot of governors

1:07:31.860 --> 1:07:33.360
 in this country at this point,

1:07:34.740 --> 1:07:36.740
 and of course the federal government,

1:07:36.740 --> 1:07:40.300
 including the president's own teams,

1:07:40.300 --> 1:07:44.840
 and the heads of the NIH, the heads of the CDC about this.

1:07:45.820 --> 1:07:50.040
 The problem is the tests don't exist in this country

1:07:50.040 --> 1:07:52.420
 at the level that we need them to right now

1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:57.140
 to make that kind of policy, to make that kind of program.

1:07:57.140 --> 1:07:59.140
 They could, but they don't.

1:07:59.140 --> 1:08:03.040
 And so what that means is that when Mayor Garcetti says,

1:08:03.040 --> 1:08:05.620
 okay, what are my actual options today,

1:08:06.780 --> 1:08:08.620
 despite these sounding like a great idea,

1:08:08.620 --> 1:08:11.700
 he looks around and he says, well, they're not authorized.

1:08:11.700 --> 1:08:15.300
 They don't exist right now for at home use.

1:08:15.300 --> 1:08:16.420
 And from his perspective,

1:08:16.420 --> 1:08:19.040
 he's not about to pick that fight with the FDA,

1:08:19.040 --> 1:08:20.980
 and it turns out nobody is.

1:08:20.980 --> 1:08:22.580
 Why are people afraid of,

1:08:22.580 --> 1:08:25.140
 it seems like an easy struggle to fight.

1:08:25.140 --> 1:08:25.980
 It's like a...

1:08:25.980 --> 1:08:28.260
 So they don't see it as a fight.

1:08:28.260 --> 1:08:31.660
 They think that the FDA is the end all be all.

1:08:31.660 --> 1:08:34.680
 Everyone thinks the FDA is the end all be all.

1:08:34.680 --> 1:08:37.760
 And so they just defer, everyone is deferential,

1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:40.820
 including the heads of all the other government agencies

1:08:40.820 --> 1:08:42.380
 because that is their role.

1:08:42.380 --> 1:08:44.980
 But what everyone is failing to see

1:08:44.980 --> 1:08:48.640
 is that the FDA doesn't even have a mandate or a remit

1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:50.820
 to evaluate these tests as public health tools.

1:08:50.820 --> 1:08:53.860
 So they're just falling in this weird gray zone

1:08:53.860 --> 1:08:56.300
 where the FDA is saying, look,

1:08:56.300 --> 1:08:57.980
 we evaluate medical products.

1:08:57.980 --> 1:08:59.500
 That's the only thing that I meant,

1:08:59.500 --> 1:09:02.740
 like Tim Stenzel, head of in vitro diagnostics at the FDA,

1:09:02.740 --> 1:09:04.900
 he's doing what his job is,

1:09:04.900 --> 1:09:08.240
 which is to evaluate medical tools.

1:09:09.220 --> 1:09:12.340
 Unfortunately, this is where I think the CDC

1:09:12.340 --> 1:09:13.820
 has really blundered.

1:09:13.820 --> 1:09:17.060
 They haven't made the right distinction to say, look,

1:09:17.060 --> 1:09:20.380
 okay, the FDA is evaluating these for doctors to use

1:09:20.380 --> 1:09:23.260
 and all that, but we're the CDC

1:09:23.260 --> 1:09:25.380
 and we're the public health agency of this country

1:09:25.380 --> 1:09:27.940
 and we recognize that these tools

1:09:27.940 --> 1:09:30.080
 require a different authorization pathway

1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:30.920
 and a different use, not prescription.

1:09:30.920 --> 1:09:33.700
 There's a difference between medical devices

1:09:33.700 --> 1:09:35.340
 and public health.

1:09:35.340 --> 1:09:38.500
 And I guess FDA is not designed for this public health,

1:09:38.500 --> 1:09:40.660
 especially in emergency situations.

1:09:40.660 --> 1:09:43.780
 And they actually explicitly say that.

1:09:43.780 --> 1:09:46.340
 I mean, when I go and talk to Tim,

1:09:46.340 --> 1:09:48.540
 and he's a very reasonable guy,

1:09:48.540 --> 1:09:50.660
 but when I talk to him, he says,

1:09:50.660 --> 1:09:55.220
 look, we don't, we just do not evaluate

1:09:55.220 --> 1:09:56.060
 a public health tool.

1:09:56.060 --> 1:09:57.500
 If you're telling me this is a public health tool,

1:09:57.500 --> 1:09:59.240
 great, go and use it.

1:09:59.240 --> 1:10:03.760
 And so I say, okay, great, we'll go and use it.

1:10:03.760 --> 1:10:05.420
 And then the comment is,

1:10:05.420 --> 1:10:08.780
 but does it give a result back to somebody?

1:10:08.780 --> 1:10:11.060
 I say, well, yes, of course it gives a result

1:10:11.060 --> 1:10:13.300
 back to somebody, it's being done in their home.

1:10:13.300 --> 1:10:16.400
 So then it's defined as a medical tool, can't use it.

1:10:16.400 --> 1:10:19.620
 So it's stuck in this gray zone where unfortunately,

1:10:19.620 --> 1:10:21.780
 there's this weird definition that any tool,

1:10:21.780 --> 1:10:25.260
 any test that gives a result back to an individual

1:10:25.260 --> 1:10:29.660
 is defined by CMS, Centers for Medicaid Services,

1:10:29.660 --> 1:10:34.660
 as a medical device requiring medical authorization.

1:10:34.900 --> 1:10:36.900
 But then you go and ask, it gets crazier,

1:10:36.900 --> 1:10:38.900
 because then you go and ask Seema Verma,

1:10:38.900 --> 1:10:43.020
 the head of CMS, you know, okay,

1:10:43.020 --> 1:10:47.340
 can these be authorized as public health tools

1:10:47.340 --> 1:10:50.100
 and not fall under your definition of a medical device?

1:10:50.100 --> 1:10:52.200
 So then the FDA doesn't have to be the ones

1:10:52.200 --> 1:10:54.700
 authorizing it as a public health tool.

1:10:54.700 --> 1:10:59.060
 And Seema Verma says, oh, we don't have any jurisdiction

1:10:59.060 --> 1:11:04.060
 over point of care and sort of rapid devices like this.

1:11:04.620 --> 1:11:07.420
 We only have jurisdiction over lab devices.

1:11:07.420 --> 1:11:10.340
 So it's like nobody has ownership over it,

1:11:10.340 --> 1:11:11.660
 which means that they just keep,

1:11:11.660 --> 1:11:15.260
 they stay in this purgatory of not being approved.

1:11:15.260 --> 1:11:18.480
 And so this is where I think, frankly, it needs a president.

1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:21.040
 It needs a presidential order to just unlock them,

1:11:21.040 --> 1:11:25.900
 to say this is more important than having a prescription.

1:11:25.900 --> 1:11:28.240
 And in fact, I mean, really what's happening now,

1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:31.280
 because there is this sense that tests

1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:32.760
 are public health tools,

1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:35.140
 even if they're not being defined as such,

1:11:35.140 --> 1:11:37.100
 the FDA now is pretty much,

1:11:37.100 --> 1:11:39.100
 not only are they not authorizing these

1:11:39.100 --> 1:11:41.140
 as public health tools,

1:11:41.140 --> 1:11:43.700
 what they're doing by authorizing

1:11:43.700 --> 1:11:47.500
 what are effectively public health tools as medical devices,

1:11:47.500 --> 1:11:50.620
 they're just diluting down the practice of medicine.

1:11:50.620 --> 1:11:54.240
 I mean, his answer right now, unfortunately is,

1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:56.940
 well, I don't know why you want these to be

1:11:56.940 --> 1:11:58.940
 sort of available to everyone without a prescription.

1:11:58.940 --> 1:12:01.240
 We've already said that a doctor can write

1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:04.780
 a whole prescription for a whole college campus.

1:12:04.780 --> 1:12:06.580
 It's like, well, if you're going in that direction then,

1:12:06.580 --> 1:12:08.660
 and that's no longer medicine,

1:12:08.660 --> 1:12:11.580
 having a doctor write a prescription for a college campus,

1:12:11.580 --> 1:12:14.360
 for everyone on the campus to have repeat testing,

1:12:14.360 --> 1:12:18.780
 now we're just in the territory of eroding medicine

1:12:18.780 --> 1:12:20.860
 and eroding all of the legal rules

1:12:20.860 --> 1:12:23.820
 and reasons that we have prescriptions in the first place.

1:12:23.820 --> 1:12:27.140
 So it's just everything about it is just destructive

1:12:27.140 --> 1:12:29.900
 instead of just making a simple solution,

1:12:29.900 --> 1:12:32.980
 which is these are okay as public health tools

1:12:32.980 --> 1:12:35.500
 as long as they meet X and Y metrics,

1:12:35.500 --> 1:12:38.140
 go and CDC can put their stamp of approval on them.

1:12:38.140 --> 1:12:41.660
 What do you think, sorry if I'm stuck on this,

1:12:41.660 --> 1:12:46.660
 your mention of MIT and public health engineering, right?

1:12:47.260 --> 1:12:49.100
 I mean, it has a sense of,

1:12:49.100 --> 1:12:51.380
 I talked to computational biology folks.

1:12:51.380 --> 1:12:54.140
 It's always exciting to see computer scientists

1:12:54.140 --> 1:12:56.140
 start entering the space of biology.

1:12:56.140 --> 1:12:58.100
 And there's actually a lot of exciting things

1:12:58.100 --> 1:12:59.780
 that happen because of that,

1:12:59.780 --> 1:13:03.060
 trying to understand the fundamentals of biology.

1:13:03.060 --> 1:13:07.400
 So from the engineering approach to public health,

1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:09.660
 what kind of problems do you think can be tackled?

1:13:09.660 --> 1:13:11.580
 What kind of disciplines are involved?

1:13:11.580 --> 1:13:14.200
 Like, do you have ideas in this space?

1:13:14.200 --> 1:13:15.040
 Oh yeah.

1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:19.600
 I mean, I can speak to one of the major activities

1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:20.440
 that I wanna do.

1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:22.180
 So what I normally do in my research lab

1:13:22.180 --> 1:13:26.260
 is develop technologies that can take a drop

1:13:26.260 --> 1:13:27.940
 of somebody's blood or some saliva

1:13:27.940 --> 1:13:30.560
 and profile for hundreds of thousands

1:13:30.560 --> 1:13:33.300
 of different antibodies against every single pathogen

1:13:33.300 --> 1:13:35.540
 that somebody could be possibly exposed to.

1:13:35.540 --> 1:13:36.380
 That's awesome.

1:13:36.380 --> 1:13:38.300
 So this is all new technology

1:13:38.300 --> 1:13:39.440
 that we've been developing more

1:13:39.440 --> 1:13:43.100
 from a bioengineering perspective.

1:13:43.100 --> 1:13:47.700
 But then I use a lot of the mathematics tools

1:13:47.700 --> 1:13:49.380
 to A, interpret that.

1:13:49.380 --> 1:13:51.020
 But what I really wanna do, for example,

1:13:51.020 --> 1:13:52.680
 to kind of kick off this new field

1:13:52.680 --> 1:13:55.260
 of what I consider public health engineering

1:13:55.260 --> 1:13:57.640
 is to create, maybe it's a little ambitious,

1:13:57.640 --> 1:14:02.260
 but create a weather system for viruses.

1:14:02.260 --> 1:14:06.100
 I want us to be able to open up our iPhones,

1:14:06.100 --> 1:14:08.820
 plug in our zip code and get a better sense,

1:14:08.820 --> 1:14:11.700
 get a probability of why my kid has a runny nose today.

1:14:11.700 --> 1:14:13.060
 Is it COVID?

1:14:13.060 --> 1:14:16.500
 Is it a rhinovirus, an adenovirus, or is it flu?

1:14:16.500 --> 1:14:17.980
 And we can do that.

1:14:17.980 --> 1:14:21.100
 We can start building the rules of virus spread

1:14:21.100 --> 1:14:24.300
 across the globe, both for pandemic preparedness,

1:14:24.300 --> 1:14:28.900
 but also for just everyday use in the same way

1:14:28.900 --> 1:14:31.180
 that people used to think that predicting the weather

1:14:31.180 --> 1:14:33.220
 was gonna be impossible.

1:14:33.220 --> 1:14:34.860
 Of course, we know that's not impossible now.

1:14:34.860 --> 1:14:35.740
 Is it always perfect?

1:14:35.740 --> 1:14:39.780
 No, but does it offer, does it completely change the way

1:14:39.780 --> 1:14:42.260
 that we go about our days?

1:14:42.260 --> 1:14:43.140
 Absolutely.

1:14:44.380 --> 1:14:46.860
 I envision, for example, right now,

1:14:46.860 --> 1:14:50.100
 we open up our iPhone, we plug in a zip code,

1:14:50.100 --> 1:14:51.860
 and if it tells us it's gonna rain today,

1:14:51.860 --> 1:14:53.380
 we bring an umbrella.

1:14:53.380 --> 1:14:56.100
 So in the future, it tells us,

1:14:56.100 --> 1:14:59.660
 hey, there's a lot of SARS CoV2 in your community.

1:14:59.660 --> 1:15:02.500
 Instead of grabbing your umbrella, you grab your mask.

1:15:02.500 --> 1:15:05.260
 We don't have to have masks all the time.

1:15:05.260 --> 1:15:07.380
 But if we know the rules of the game

1:15:07.380 --> 1:15:09.340
 that these viruses play by,

1:15:09.340 --> 1:15:10.820
 we can start preparing for those.

1:15:10.820 --> 1:15:15.820
 And every year, we go into every flu season blindfolded

1:15:15.900 --> 1:15:18.700
 with our hands tied behind our back, just saying,

1:15:18.700 --> 1:15:21.660
 I hope this isn't a bad flu season this year.

1:15:21.660 --> 1:15:26.340
 I don't, I mean, this is, we're in the 21st century.

1:15:28.980 --> 1:15:31.140
 We have the tools at our disposal now

1:15:31.140 --> 1:15:32.740
 to not have that attitude.

1:15:32.740 --> 1:15:35.420
 This isn't like 1920s.

1:15:35.420 --> 1:15:37.380
 You know, we can just say,

1:15:37.380 --> 1:15:40.500
 hey, this is gonna be a bad flu season this year.

1:15:40.500 --> 1:15:44.780
 Let's act accordingly and with a targeted approach.

1:15:44.780 --> 1:15:47.060
 You know, we don't, for example,

1:15:47.060 --> 1:15:50.300
 we don't just use our umbrellas all day long,

1:15:50.300 --> 1:15:53.620
 every single day, in case it might rain.

1:15:53.620 --> 1:15:55.580
 We don't board up our homes every single day

1:15:55.580 --> 1:15:56.700
 in case there's a hurricane.

1:15:56.700 --> 1:15:58.940
 We wait, and if we know that there's one coming,

1:15:58.940 --> 1:16:03.420
 then we act for a small period of time accordingly.

1:16:03.420 --> 1:16:05.780
 And then we go back, and we've prepared ourselves

1:16:05.780 --> 1:16:09.220
 in like these little bursts to not have it ruin our days.

1:16:09.220 --> 1:16:10.740
 I can't tell you how exciting

1:16:10.740 --> 1:16:13.140
 that vision of the future is.

1:16:13.140 --> 1:16:14.580
 I think that's incredible.

1:16:14.580 --> 1:16:17.380
 And it seems like it should be within our reach,

1:16:17.380 --> 1:16:22.380
 the, just these like weather maps of viruses

1:16:22.380 --> 1:16:26.060
 floating about the Earth, and it seems obvious.

1:16:26.060 --> 1:16:28.780
 It's one of those things where right now,

1:16:28.780 --> 1:16:31.980
 it seems like maybe impossible.

1:16:31.980 --> 1:16:34.820
 And then looking back like 20 years from now,

1:16:34.820 --> 1:16:37.620
 we'll wonder like why the hell

1:16:37.620 --> 1:16:39.340
 this hasn't been done way earlier.

1:16:39.340 --> 1:16:42.260
 Though one difference between weather,

1:16:42.260 --> 1:16:45.380
 I don't know if you have interesting ideas in this space.

1:16:45.380 --> 1:16:47.940
 The difference between weather and viruses

1:16:47.940 --> 1:16:51.140
 is it includes, the collection of the data

1:16:51.140 --> 1:16:54.460
 includes the human body, potentially.

1:16:54.460 --> 1:16:59.420
 And that means that there is some, as with the contact

1:16:59.420 --> 1:17:03.460
 tracing question, there's some concern about privacy.

1:17:03.460 --> 1:17:06.220
 There seems to be this dance that's really complicated.

1:17:07.700 --> 1:17:11.180
 With Facebook getting a lot of flack

1:17:11.180 --> 1:17:13.540
 for basically misusing people's data,

1:17:13.540 --> 1:17:17.460
 or just whether it's perception or reality,

1:17:17.460 --> 1:17:19.900
 there's certainly a lot of reality to it too,

1:17:19.900 --> 1:17:24.900
 where they're not good stewards of our private data.

1:17:25.380 --> 1:17:28.900
 So there's this weird place where it's like obvious

1:17:28.900 --> 1:17:33.100
 that if we do, if we collect a lot of data

1:17:33.100 --> 1:17:37.180
 about human beings and maintain privacy

1:17:37.180 --> 1:17:40.900
 and maintain all like basic respect for that data,

1:17:40.900 --> 1:17:43.780
 just like honestly common sense respect for the data,

1:17:43.780 --> 1:17:46.340
 that we can do a lot of amazing things for the world,

1:17:46.340 --> 1:17:48.940
 like a weather map for viruses.

1:17:48.940 --> 1:17:52.740
 Is there a way forward to gain trust of people

1:17:53.700 --> 1:17:56.740
 or to do this well, do you have ideas here?

1:17:56.740 --> 1:17:58.540
 How big is this problem?

1:17:58.540 --> 1:18:00.740
 I think it's a central problem.

1:18:00.740 --> 1:18:02.700
 There's a couple central problems that need to be solved.

1:18:02.700 --> 1:18:05.580
 One, how do you get all the samples?

1:18:05.580 --> 1:18:07.060
 That's not actually too difficult.

1:18:07.060 --> 1:18:10.100
 I'm actually, I have a pilot project going right now

1:18:10.100 --> 1:18:13.300
 with getting samples from across all the United States.

1:18:14.340 --> 1:18:16.140
 Tens of thousands of samples every week

1:18:16.140 --> 1:18:19.220
 are flowing into my lab and we process them.

1:18:19.220 --> 1:18:22.260
 So it's taking the, it's taking like one of the,

1:18:22.260 --> 1:18:26.220
 basically there's biology here and chemistry

1:18:26.220 --> 1:18:27.900
 and converting that into numbers.

1:18:27.900 --> 1:18:28.740
 That's exactly right.

1:18:28.740 --> 1:18:30.060
 So what we're doing, for example,

1:18:30.060 --> 1:18:32.980
 there's a lot of people who go to the hospital every day,

1:18:32.980 --> 1:18:36.300
 a lot of people who donate blood, people who donate plasma.

1:18:36.300 --> 1:18:38.540
 So one of the projects that I have,

1:18:38.540 --> 1:18:40.260
 I'll get to the privacy question in a moment,

1:18:40.260 --> 1:18:43.060
 but this, so what I wanna do is the name that I've given

1:18:43.060 --> 1:18:46.980
 this as a global immunological observatory.

1:18:46.980 --> 1:18:48.500
 There's no reason not to have that.

1:18:48.500 --> 1:18:49.460
 Good name.

1:18:49.460 --> 1:18:51.140
 I've said, instead of saying, well,

1:18:51.140 --> 1:18:53.540
 how do we possibly get enough people on board

1:18:53.540 --> 1:18:56.020
 to send in samples all the time?

1:18:56.020 --> 1:18:57.700
 Well, just go to the source.

1:18:57.700 --> 1:18:59.700
 So there's a company in Massachusetts

1:18:59.700 --> 1:19:02.260
 that makes 80% of all the instruments

1:19:02.260 --> 1:19:07.140
 that are used globally to collect plasma from plasma donors.

1:19:07.140 --> 1:19:11.380
 So I went to this company, Hemenetics, and said,

1:19:11.380 --> 1:19:15.500
 is there a way you have 80% of the global market

1:19:15.500 --> 1:19:17.660
 on plasma donations?

1:19:18.780 --> 1:19:21.500
 Can we start getting plasma samples

1:19:21.500 --> 1:19:24.220
 from healthy people that use your machines?

1:19:24.220 --> 1:19:26.700
 So that hooked me up with this company called Octopharma.

1:19:26.700 --> 1:19:28.700
 And Octopharma has a huge reach

1:19:28.700 --> 1:19:30.860
 and offices all over the country

1:19:30.860 --> 1:19:32.780
 where they're just collecting people's plasma.

1:19:32.780 --> 1:19:35.460
 They actually pay people for their plasma

1:19:35.460 --> 1:19:37.100
 and then that gets distributed to hospitals

1:19:37.100 --> 1:19:39.340
 and all this stuff is anonymous plasma.

1:19:39.340 --> 1:19:41.740
 So I've just been collecting anonymous samples.

1:19:43.100 --> 1:19:45.100
 And we're processing them, in this case,

1:19:45.100 --> 1:19:48.340
 for COVID antibodies to watch from January

1:19:48.340 --> 1:19:51.420
 up through December, we're able to watch

1:19:51.420 --> 1:19:54.220
 how the virus entered into the United States

1:19:54.220 --> 1:19:58.780
 and how it's transmitting every day across the US.

1:19:58.780 --> 1:20:02.460
 So we're getting those results organized now

1:20:02.460 --> 1:20:06.060
 and we're gonna start putting them publicly online soon

1:20:06.060 --> 1:20:09.420
 to start making at least a very rough map of COVID.

1:20:10.860 --> 1:20:12.820
 But that's the type of thinking that I have

1:20:12.820 --> 1:20:14.700
 in terms of like, how do you actually capture

1:20:14.700 --> 1:20:17.060
 huge numbers of specimens?

1:20:17.060 --> 1:20:20.220
 You can't ask everyone to participate on sort of a,

1:20:20.220 --> 1:20:23.020
 I mean, you maybe could if you have the right tools

1:20:23.020 --> 1:20:25.420
 and you can offer individuals something in return

1:20:25.420 --> 1:20:26.820
 like 23andMe does.

1:20:27.900 --> 1:20:29.980
 That's a great way to get people to give specimens

1:20:29.980 --> 1:20:31.060
 and they get results back.

1:20:31.060 --> 1:20:34.500
 So with these technologies that I've been building

1:20:34.500 --> 1:20:36.140
 along with some collaborators at Harvard,

1:20:36.140 --> 1:20:39.940
 we can come up with tools that people might actually want.

1:20:39.940 --> 1:20:43.260
 So I can offer you your immunological history.

1:20:43.260 --> 1:20:47.100
 I can say, give me a drop of your blood on a filter paper,

1:20:47.100 --> 1:20:49.860
 mail it in and I will be able to tell you

1:20:49.860 --> 1:20:52.060
 every infectious disease you've ever encountered

1:20:52.060 --> 1:20:54.460
 and maybe even when you encountered it roughly.

1:20:55.620 --> 1:20:58.820
 I could tell you, do you have COVID antibodies right now?

1:20:58.820 --> 1:21:00.620
 Do you have Lyme disease antibodies right now?

1:21:00.620 --> 1:21:03.740
 Flu, triple E and all these different viruses.

1:21:03.740 --> 1:21:07.380
 Also peanut allergies, milk allergies, anything.

1:21:07.380 --> 1:21:11.300
 If your immune system makes a response to it,

1:21:11.300 --> 1:21:13.260
 we can detect that response.

1:21:14.940 --> 1:21:17.660
 So all of a sudden we have this very valuable technology

1:21:17.660 --> 1:21:19.980
 that on the one hand gives people maybe information

1:21:19.980 --> 1:21:22.020
 they might want to know about themselves,

1:21:22.020 --> 1:21:25.020
 but on the other hand becomes this amazingly rich

1:21:25.020 --> 1:21:28.100
 source of big data to enter into

1:21:28.100 --> 1:21:29.900
 this global immunological observatory

1:21:29.900 --> 1:21:32.260
 sort of mathematical framework to start building

1:21:32.260 --> 1:21:34.820
 these maps, these epidemiological tools.

1:21:34.820 --> 1:21:36.740
 But you asked about privacy

1:21:36.740 --> 1:21:40.380
 and absolutely that's essential to keep in mind

1:21:40.380 --> 1:21:41.900
 first and foremost.

1:21:41.900 --> 1:21:43.740
 So privacy can be,

1:21:43.740 --> 1:21:47.100
 you can keep these samples 100% anonymous.

1:21:47.100 --> 1:21:49.340
 They are just, when I get them, they show up with nothing.

1:21:49.340 --> 1:21:51.340
 They're literally just tubes.

1:21:51.340 --> 1:21:52.900
 I know a date that they were collected

1:21:52.900 --> 1:21:54.660
 and a zip code that they're collected from

1:21:54.660 --> 1:21:59.020
 or even just sort of a county level ID.

1:21:59.020 --> 1:22:02.300
 So with an IRB and with ethical approval

1:22:02.300 --> 1:22:03.740
 and with the people's consent,

1:22:03.740 --> 1:22:05.100
 we can maybe collect more data,

1:22:05.100 --> 1:22:07.340
 but that would require consent.

1:22:07.340 --> 1:22:09.540
 But then there's this other approach

1:22:09.540 --> 1:22:10.980
 which I'm really excited about,

1:22:10.980 --> 1:22:14.460
 which is certainly going to gain some scrutiny I think,

1:22:14.460 --> 1:22:17.900
 but we'll have to figure out where it comes into play.

1:22:17.900 --> 1:22:20.660
 But I've been recognizing that we can take somebody's

1:22:20.660 --> 1:22:24.060
 immunological profile and we can make a biological

1:22:24.060 --> 1:22:25.700
 fingerprint out of it.

1:22:25.700 --> 1:22:27.300
 And it's actually stable enough

1:22:27.300 --> 1:22:28.540
 so that I could take your blood.

1:22:28.540 --> 1:22:30.460
 Let's say I don't know who you are,

1:22:30.460 --> 1:22:34.300
 but you sent me a drop of blood a year ago

1:22:34.300 --> 1:22:36.540
 and then you sent me a drop of blood today.

1:22:36.540 --> 1:22:38.300
 I don't know that those two blood spots

1:22:38.300 --> 1:22:39.740
 are coming from the same person.

1:22:39.740 --> 1:22:41.420
 They're just showing up in my lab.

1:22:42.380 --> 1:22:46.500
 But I can run our technology over

1:22:46.500 --> 1:22:49.820
 and it just gives me your immunological history.

1:22:49.820 --> 1:22:52.340
 But your immunological history is so unique to you

1:22:52.340 --> 1:22:55.380
 and the way that your body responds to these pathogens

1:22:55.380 --> 1:22:57.180
 is so unique to you

1:22:57.180 --> 1:22:59.620
 that I can use that to tether your two samples.

1:22:59.620 --> 1:23:02.700
 I don't know who you are, I know nothing about you.

1:23:02.700 --> 1:23:06.580
 I only know when those samples came out of a person.

1:23:06.580 --> 1:23:09.100
 But I can say, oh, these two samples a year apart

1:23:09.100 --> 1:23:10.900
 actually belong to the same person.

1:23:10.900 --> 1:23:12.340
 Yeah, so there's sufficient information

1:23:12.340 --> 1:23:16.060
 in that immunological history to match the samples.

1:23:16.060 --> 1:23:18.540
 Or from a privacy perspective, that's really exciting.

1:23:18.540 --> 1:23:20.220
 Does that generally hold for humans?

1:23:20.220 --> 1:23:23.780
 So you're saying there's enough uniqueness to match?

1:23:23.780 --> 1:23:25.980
 Yeah, because it's very stochastic, even twins.

1:23:25.980 --> 1:23:28.220
 So this, I believe, we haven't published this yet.

1:23:28.220 --> 1:23:29.380
 We will soon.

1:23:29.380 --> 1:23:30.540
 You have a twin too, right?

1:23:30.540 --> 1:23:32.500
 I do have a twin, I have an identical twin brother,

1:23:32.500 --> 1:23:34.660
 which makes me interested in this.

1:23:34.660 --> 1:23:36.460
 He looks very much like me.

1:23:36.460 --> 1:23:37.620
 Oh, is that how that works?

1:23:37.620 --> 1:23:38.940
 Yeah.

1:23:38.940 --> 1:23:41.940
 And DNA can't really tell us apart.

1:23:42.780 --> 1:23:45.580
 But this tool is one of the only tools in the world

1:23:45.580 --> 1:23:48.020
 that could tell twins apart from each other.

1:23:48.020 --> 1:23:51.540
 Could still be accurate enough to say this blood,

1:23:51.540 --> 1:23:56.540
 it's like 99.999% accurate to say

1:23:56.940 --> 1:24:00.380
 that these two blood samples came from the same individual.

1:24:00.380 --> 1:24:01.940
 And it's because it's a combination,

1:24:01.940 --> 1:24:04.140
 both of your immunological history,

1:24:04.140 --> 1:24:09.140
 but also how your unique body responds to a pathogen,

1:24:09.260 --> 1:24:10.900
 which is random.

1:24:10.900 --> 1:24:14.180
 The way that we make antibodies is, by and large,

1:24:14.180 --> 1:24:17.540
 it's got an element of randomness to it.

1:24:17.540 --> 1:24:19.460
 How the cells, when they make an antibody,

1:24:19.460 --> 1:24:22.500
 they chop up the genetic code to say,

1:24:22.500 --> 1:24:24.220
 okay, this is the antibody that I'm gonna form

1:24:24.220 --> 1:24:26.180
 for this pathogen.

1:24:26.180 --> 1:24:29.740
 And you might form, if you get a coronavirus, for example,

1:24:29.740 --> 1:24:31.940
 you might form hundreds of different antibodies,

1:24:31.940 --> 1:24:33.940
 not just one antibody against the spike protein,

1:24:33.940 --> 1:24:35.700
 but hundreds of different antibodies

1:24:35.700 --> 1:24:38.300
 against all different parts of the virus.

1:24:38.300 --> 1:24:42.180
 So that gives this really rich resolution of information

1:24:42.180 --> 1:24:43.620
 that when I then do the same thing

1:24:43.620 --> 1:24:45.340
 across hundreds of different pathogens,

1:24:45.340 --> 1:24:48.300
 some of which you've seen, some of which you haven't,

1:24:48.300 --> 1:24:50.540
 it gives you an exceedingly unique fingerprint

1:24:50.540 --> 1:24:54.900
 that is sufficiently stable over years and years and years

1:24:54.900 --> 1:24:57.740
 to essentially give you a barcode.

1:24:57.740 --> 1:24:59.580
 And I don't have to know who you are,

1:24:59.580 --> 1:25:01.380
 but I can know that these two specimens

1:25:01.380 --> 1:25:04.500
 came from the same person somewhere out in the world.

1:25:04.500 --> 1:25:07.020
 So fascinating that there's this trace,

1:25:07.020 --> 1:25:11.160
 your life story in the space of viruses,

1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:16.160
 in the space of pathogen, like these,

1:25:16.160 --> 1:25:18.680
 you know, because there's this entire universe

1:25:18.680 --> 1:25:22.200
 of these organisms that are trying to destroy each other.

1:25:23.200 --> 1:25:25.920
 And then your little trajectory through that space

1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:29.400
 leaves a trace, and then you can look at that trace.

1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:30.320
 That's fascinating.

1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:33.120
 And that, I mean, there's, okay,

1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:35.520
 that data period is just fascinating.

1:25:35.520 --> 1:25:40.200
 And the vision of making that data universally connected

1:25:40.200 --> 1:25:43.580
 to where you can make, like infer things,

1:25:43.580 --> 1:25:47.440
 and just like with the weather, is really fascinating.

1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:49.800
 And there's probably artificial intelligence

1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:51.880
 applications there, start making predictions,

1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:53.080
 start finding patterns.

1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:54.880
 Exactly, we're doing a lot of that already.

1:25:54.880 --> 1:25:57.280
 And that's how, how do we have this going?

1:25:57.280 --> 1:26:00.320
 You know, I've been trying to get this funded for years now.

1:26:00.320 --> 1:26:02.640
 And I've spoken to governments, you know,

1:26:02.640 --> 1:26:05.440
 everyone says, cool idea, not gonna do it.

1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:07.200
 You know, why do we need it?

1:26:07.200 --> 1:26:08.040
 Oh, really?

1:26:08.040 --> 1:26:08.860
 The why do you need it?

1:26:08.860 --> 1:26:10.040
 Yeah, the why do you need it.

1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:12.200
 And of course now, you know, I mean,

1:26:12.200 --> 1:26:14.380
 I wrote in 2015 about this,

1:26:15.720 --> 1:26:18.160
 why we would, why this would be useful.

1:26:18.160 --> 1:26:21.240
 And of course, now we're seeing why it would be useful.

1:26:21.240 --> 1:26:25.560
 Had we had this up and running in 2019,

1:26:25.560 --> 1:26:28.520
 had we had it going, we were drawing blood from,

1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:30.760
 you know, we're getting blood samples from hospitals

1:26:30.760 --> 1:26:32.800
 and clinics and blood donors from New York City,

1:26:32.800 --> 1:26:36.320
 let's just say, you know, that could have,

1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:40.640
 we didn't run the first PCR test for coronavirus

1:26:40.640 --> 1:26:43.880
 until probably a month and a half or two months

1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:46.960
 after the virus started transmitting in New York City.

1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:48.040
 So it's like with the rain,

1:26:48.040 --> 1:26:52.320
 we didn't start wearing umbrella or taking out umbrellas.

1:26:52.320 --> 1:26:55.160
 Exactly, for two months, but different than the rain,

1:26:55.160 --> 1:26:58.000
 we couldn't actually see that it was spreading right now.

1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.560
 And so Andrew Cuomo had no choice

1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:02.200
 but to leave the city open.

1:27:02.200 --> 1:27:03.840
 You know, there were hints that maybe the virus

1:27:03.840 --> 1:27:05.360
 was spreading in New York City,

1:27:05.360 --> 1:27:07.900
 but you know, he didn't have any data to back it up.

1:27:07.900 --> 1:27:08.740
 No data.

1:27:08.740 --> 1:27:11.320
 And so it was just week on week and week.

1:27:12.680 --> 1:27:17.060
 And he didn't have any information to really go by

1:27:17.060 --> 1:27:18.800
 to allow him to have the firepower

1:27:18.800 --> 1:27:20.480
 to say we're closing down the city.

1:27:20.480 --> 1:27:21.360
 This is an emergency.

1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:23.360
 We have to stop spread before it starts.

1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:28.300
 And so they waited until the first PCR tests

1:27:28.300 --> 1:27:29.140
 were coming about.

1:27:29.140 --> 1:27:30.600
 And then the moment they started running PCR tests,

1:27:30.600 --> 1:27:32.280
 they find out it's everywhere.

1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:33.840
 You know, and so that was a disaster

1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:36.440
 because of course New York City, you know,

1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:39.720
 was just hit so bad because nobody was,

1:27:39.720 --> 1:27:41.640
 you know, we were blind to it.

1:27:41.640 --> 1:27:43.000
 We didn't have to be blind to it.

1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:45.640
 And the nice thing about this technology is

1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:47.940
 we wouldn't have, with the exact same technology

1:27:47.940 --> 1:27:51.560
 we had in 2017, we could have detected

1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:56.320
 this novel coronavirus spreading in New York City in 2020.

1:27:56.320 --> 1:27:58.860
 Not because we changed, not because we are actually

1:27:58.860 --> 1:28:01.560
 actively looking for this novel coronavirus,

1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:04.300
 but because we would see, we would have seen patterns

1:28:04.300 --> 1:28:06.400
 in people's immune responses using AI,

1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:10.520
 or just frankly using our, just the raw data itself.

1:28:10.520 --> 1:28:13.180
 We could have said, hey, it looks like there's

1:28:13.180 --> 1:28:15.760
 something that looks like known coronavirus

1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:18.280
 is spreading in New York, but there's gaps.

1:28:18.280 --> 1:28:19.800
 You know, there's, for some reason,

1:28:19.800 --> 1:28:21.680
 people aren't developing an immune response

1:28:21.680 --> 1:28:23.500
 to this coronavirus that seems to be spreading

1:28:23.500 --> 1:28:25.640
 to these normal things that, you know,

1:28:25.640 --> 1:28:28.280
 and it just looks, the profile looks different.

1:28:29.200 --> 1:28:31.600
 And we could have seen that and immediately,

1:28:31.600 --> 1:28:33.680
 especially since we had an idea that

1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:37.560
 there was a novel coronavirus circulating in the world,

1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:39.960
 we could have very quickly and easily seen,

1:28:39.960 --> 1:28:42.760
 hey, clearly we're seeing a spike of something

1:28:42.760 --> 1:28:44.320
 that looks like a known coronavirus,

1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:46.960
 but people are responding weirdly to it.

1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:49.640
 Our AI algorithms would have picked it up,

1:28:49.640 --> 1:28:52.760
 and just our basic, heck, you could have put it

1:28:52.760 --> 1:28:55.040
 in an Excel spreadsheet, we would have seen it.

1:28:55.040 --> 1:28:56.600
 So.

1:28:56.600 --> 1:28:58.240
 Some basic visualization would have shown it.

1:28:58.240 --> 1:28:59.840
 Exactly, we would have seen spikes,

1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:02.680
 and they would have been kind of like off, you know,

1:29:02.680 --> 1:29:04.440
 immune responses that the shape of them

1:29:04.440 --> 1:29:06.320
 just looked a little bit different,

1:29:06.320 --> 1:29:07.600
 but they would have been growing,

1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:09.400
 and we would have seen it, and it could have

1:29:09.400 --> 1:29:12.320
 saved tens of thousands of lives in New York City.

1:29:12.320 --> 1:29:14.040
 So to me, the fascinating question,

1:29:14.040 --> 1:29:15.040
 everything we've talked about,

1:29:15.040 --> 1:29:18.040
 so both the huge collection of data at scale,

1:29:18.040 --> 1:29:22.600
 just super exciting, and then the kind of obvious

1:29:23.480 --> 1:29:26.320
 at scale solution to the current virus

1:29:26.320 --> 1:29:30.200
 and future ones is the rapid testing.

1:29:30.200 --> 1:29:34.440
 Can we talk about the future of viruses

1:29:34.440 --> 1:29:39.440
 that might be threatening our very existence?

1:29:39.840 --> 1:29:44.160
 So do you think like a future natural virus

1:29:44.160 --> 1:29:49.160
 can have an order of magnitude greater effect

1:29:49.640 --> 1:29:52.240
 on human civilization than anything we've ever seen?

1:29:52.240 --> 1:29:56.200
 So something that either kills all humans,

1:29:56.200 --> 1:30:01.200
 or kills, I don't know, 60, 70% of humans.

1:30:01.520 --> 1:30:06.520
 So something like something we can't even imagine.

1:30:06.600 --> 1:30:09.360
 Is that something that you think is possible?

1:30:09.360 --> 1:30:11.760
 Because it seems to not have happened yet.

1:30:11.760 --> 1:30:16.760
 So maybe like the entirety, whoever the programmer is

1:30:17.080 --> 1:30:20.040
 of the simulation that sort of launched the evolution

1:30:20.040 --> 1:30:24.680
 from the Big Bang seems to not want to destroy us humans.

1:30:24.680 --> 1:30:26.320
 Or maybe that's the natural side effect

1:30:26.320 --> 1:30:30.280
 of the evolutionary process that humans are useful.

1:30:30.280 --> 1:30:31.520
 But do you think it's possible

1:30:31.520 --> 1:30:34.160
 that the evolutionary process will produce a virus

1:30:34.160 --> 1:30:35.720
 that will kill all humans?

1:30:35.720 --> 1:30:36.960
 I think it could.

1:30:36.960 --> 1:30:38.080
 I don't think it's likely.

1:30:38.080 --> 1:30:39.640
 And the reason I don't think it's likely

1:30:39.640 --> 1:30:43.480
 is on the one hand, it hasn't happened yet,

1:30:45.080 --> 1:30:50.080
 in part because mobility is a recent phenomena.

1:30:50.920 --> 1:30:52.560
 People weren't particularly mobile

1:30:52.560 --> 1:30:55.960
 until fairly recently.

1:30:55.960 --> 1:30:58.520
 Now, of course, now that we have people flying back

1:30:58.520 --> 1:31:00.600
 and forth across the globe all the time,

1:31:02.400 --> 1:31:05.240
 the chances of global pandemics

1:31:05.240 --> 1:31:08.120
 has escalated exponentially, of course.

1:31:08.120 --> 1:31:10.000
 And so on the one hand,

1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:11.920
 that's part of why it hasn't happened yet.

1:31:11.920 --> 1:31:14.240
 We can look at things like Ebola.

1:31:14.240 --> 1:31:19.240
 Now, Ebola, we haven't generally had major Ebola epidemics

1:31:19.240 --> 1:31:21.880
 in the past, not because Ebola wasn't transmitting

1:31:21.880 --> 1:31:25.880
 and infecting humans, but because it was largely affecting

1:31:25.880 --> 1:31:29.600
 and infecting humans in disconnected communities.

1:31:29.600 --> 1:31:34.600
 So you see out in rural parts of Africa, for example,

1:31:34.600 --> 1:31:36.880
 in Western Africa, you might end up having

1:31:36.880 --> 1:31:39.360
 isolated Ebola outbreaks,

1:31:39.360 --> 1:31:42.480
 but there weren't connections that were fast enough

1:31:42.480 --> 1:31:45.240
 that would allow people to then spread it into the cities.

1:31:45.240 --> 1:31:50.240
 Of course, we saw back in 2014, 15 massive Ebola outbreak

1:31:53.280 --> 1:31:58.280
 that wasn't because it was a new strain of Ebola,

1:31:58.280 --> 1:32:01.400
 but it was because there's new inroads and connections

1:32:01.400 --> 1:32:04.800
 between the communities and people got it to the city.

1:32:04.800 --> 1:32:07.160
 And so we saw it start to spread.

1:32:07.160 --> 1:32:11.000
 So that should be a little bit foreshadowing

1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:12.720
 of what's to come.

1:32:12.720 --> 1:32:15.360
 And now we have this pandemic.

1:32:15.360 --> 1:32:17.240
 We had 2009, we have this.

1:32:18.640 --> 1:32:23.640
 There is a benefit or there is sort of a natural check.

1:32:23.760 --> 1:32:26.360
 And this is like kind of like a Voltaire

1:32:26.360 --> 1:32:28.680
 predator prey dynamic kind of systems,

1:32:28.680 --> 1:32:30.920
 ecological systems and mathematics that

1:32:32.160 --> 1:32:34.560
 if you have something that's so deadly,

1:32:34.560 --> 1:32:39.560
 people will respond more maybe with a greater panic,

1:32:39.960 --> 1:32:42.200
 a greater sense of panic, which alone could, you know,

1:32:42.200 --> 1:32:43.600
 destroy humanity.

1:32:43.600 --> 1:32:47.760
 But at the same time, we now know that we can lock down.

1:32:47.760 --> 1:32:49.120
 We know that that's possible.

1:32:49.120 --> 1:32:50.760
 And so if this was a worse virus

1:32:50.760 --> 1:32:53.800
 that was actually killing 60% of people as infecting,

1:32:53.800 --> 1:32:55.920
 we would lock down very quickly.

1:32:55.920 --> 1:32:59.520
 My biggest fear though, is let's say that was happening.

1:32:59.520 --> 1:33:03.000
 You need serious lockdowns if you're gonna keep things going.

1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:05.280
 So the only reason we were able to keep things going

1:33:05.280 --> 1:33:08.480
 during our lockdowns is because it wasn't so bad

1:33:08.480 --> 1:33:10.120
 that we were still able to have people work

1:33:10.120 --> 1:33:13.360
 in the grocery stores.

1:33:13.360 --> 1:33:14.640
 Still have people work in the shipping

1:33:14.640 --> 1:33:16.640
 to get the food onto the shelves.

1:33:16.640 --> 1:33:18.800
 So on the one hand, we could probably figure out

1:33:18.800 --> 1:33:20.120
 how to stop the virus,

1:33:21.200 --> 1:33:24.880
 but can we stop the virus without starving?

1:33:24.880 --> 1:33:26.520
 You know, and I'm not sure that that,

1:33:26.520 --> 1:33:30.240
 if this was another acute respiratory virus

1:33:30.240 --> 1:33:34.080
 that say had a slightly, say it transmitted the same way,

1:33:34.080 --> 1:33:36.360
 but say it actually did worse damage to your heart,

1:33:36.360 --> 1:33:38.040
 but it was like a month later

1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:41.480
 that people started having heart attacks in mass.

1:33:41.480 --> 1:33:45.640
 You know, it's like not just one offs, but really severe.

1:33:45.640 --> 1:33:49.080
 Well, that could be a serious problem for humanity.

1:33:50.840 --> 1:33:53.680
 So in some ways I think that there are lots of ways

1:33:53.680 --> 1:33:56.800
 that we could end up dying at the hand of a virus.

1:33:56.800 --> 1:33:57.800
 I mean, we're already seeing it.

1:33:57.800 --> 1:34:00.040
 Just, I mean, my fear is still,

1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:02.400
 I think coronaviruses have demonstrated

1:34:02.400 --> 1:34:06.520
 a keen ability to destroy or to create outbreaks

1:34:06.520 --> 1:34:10.320
 that can potentially be deadly to large numbers of people.

1:34:10.320 --> 1:34:14.560
 Flu strains, though, are still by and large my concern.

1:34:14.560 --> 1:34:17.600
 So you think the bad one might come from the flu,

1:34:17.600 --> 1:34:18.720
 the influenza?

1:34:18.720 --> 1:34:20.760
 Yeah, their replication cycle,

1:34:20.760 --> 1:34:22.440
 they're able to genetically recombine

1:34:22.440 --> 1:34:24.360
 in a way that coronaviruses aren't.

1:34:24.360 --> 1:34:25.920
 They have segmented genomes,

1:34:25.920 --> 1:34:27.480
 which means that they can just swap out

1:34:27.480 --> 1:34:29.640
 whole parts of their genomes, no problem,

1:34:29.640 --> 1:34:32.280
 repackage them, and then boom,

1:34:32.280 --> 1:34:35.520
 you have a whole antigenic shift, not a drift.

1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:38.120
 What that means is that on any occasion,

1:34:38.120 --> 1:34:40.760
 any day of the year, you can have, boom,

1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:44.440
 a whole new virus that didn't exist yesterday.

1:34:44.440 --> 1:34:48.200
 And now with farming and industrial livestock,

1:34:49.240 --> 1:34:53.440
 we're seeing animals and humans come into contact much more.

1:34:53.440 --> 1:34:58.440
 Just the opportunities for an influenza strain

1:34:58.840 --> 1:35:01.800
 that is unique and deadly to humans increases.

1:35:01.800 --> 1:35:05.800
 All the while, transmission and mobility has increased.

1:35:06.760 --> 1:35:08.880
 It's just a matter of time, in my opinion.

1:35:09.800 --> 1:35:12.880
 What about from immunology perspective

1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:16.320
 of the idea of engineering a virus?

1:35:16.320 --> 1:35:18.720
 So not just the virus leaking from a lab or something,

1:35:18.720 --> 1:35:23.560
 but actually being able to understand the protein,

1:35:23.560 --> 1:35:26.560
 like everything about what makes a virus enough

1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:31.560
 to be able to figure out ways to maybe target it

1:35:33.680 --> 1:35:36.360
 or untarget it, attack biologics.

1:35:36.360 --> 1:35:38.080
 Subverse immunity.

1:35:38.080 --> 1:35:38.920
 Yeah.

1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:39.760
 Yeah.

1:35:39.760 --> 1:35:43.080
 Is that something, obviously that's somewhere

1:35:43.080 --> 1:35:48.080
 on the list of concerns, but is that anywhere close

1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:51.160
 of the top 10 highlights along with nuclear weapons

1:35:51.160 --> 1:35:53.200
 and so on that we should be worried about?

1:35:53.200 --> 1:35:55.640
 Or is the natural pandemic really the one

1:35:55.640 --> 1:35:58.160
 that's much greater concern?

1:35:58.160 --> 1:36:02.240
 I would say that the former, that manmade viruses

1:36:02.240 --> 1:36:07.240
 and genetically engineered viruses should be right up there

1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:10.720
 with the greatest concerns for humanity right now.

1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:15.240
 We know that the tools, for better or worse,

1:36:15.240 --> 1:36:19.720
 the tools for creating a virus are there.

1:36:19.720 --> 1:36:20.600
 We can do it.

1:36:20.600 --> 1:36:25.600
 And I mean, heck, the human species

1:36:25.800 --> 1:36:28.160
 is no longer vaccinated against smallpox.

1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:29.600
 I didn't get a smallpox vaccine.

1:36:29.600 --> 1:36:32.160
 You didn't get a smallpox vaccine, at least I don't think.

1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:37.040
 And so if somebody wanted to make smallpox

1:36:37.040 --> 1:36:41.080
 and distribute it to the world in some way,

1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:46.080
 it could be exceedingly deadly and detrimental to humans.

1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:51.080
 And that's not even sort of using your imagination

1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:52.240
 to create a new virus.

1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:54.320
 That's one that we already have.

1:36:54.320 --> 1:36:57.240
 Unlike the past when smallpox would circulate,

1:36:57.240 --> 1:37:00.320
 you had large fractions of the community

1:37:00.320 --> 1:37:01.840
 that was already immune to it.

1:37:02.720 --> 1:37:03.880
 And so it wouldn't spread

1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:05.320
 or it would spread a little bit slower.

1:37:05.320 --> 1:37:07.160
 But now we have essentially in a few years,

1:37:07.160 --> 1:37:10.640
 we'll have a whole global population that is susceptible.

1:37:11.760 --> 1:37:12.960
 Let's look at measles.

1:37:12.960 --> 1:37:17.960
 We have an entire, I mean, measles, I have,

1:37:18.200 --> 1:37:20.400
 there are some researchers in the world right now,

1:37:20.400 --> 1:37:23.880
 which for various reasons are working on creating

1:37:23.880 --> 1:37:26.760
 a measles strain that evades immunity.

1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:28.280
 It's not for bioterrorism,

1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:29.760
 at least that's not the expectation.

1:37:29.760 --> 1:37:33.680
 It's for using measles as an oncolytic virus to kill cancer.

1:37:34.720 --> 1:37:36.880
 And the only way you can really do that

1:37:36.880 --> 1:37:38.880
 is if your immune system doesn't,

1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:41.640
 if you take a measles virus and there's,

1:37:41.640 --> 1:37:43.880
 we don't have to go into the details of why it would work,

1:37:43.880 --> 1:37:44.960
 but it could work.

1:37:44.960 --> 1:37:48.200
 Measles likes to target potentially cancer cells.

1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:51.840
 But to get your immune system not to kill off the virus

1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:53.400
 if you're trying to use the virus to target it,

1:37:53.400 --> 1:37:57.560
 you maybe want to make it blind to the immune system.

1:37:57.560 --> 1:38:00.240
 But now imagine we took some virus like measles,

1:38:00.240 --> 1:38:04.280
 which has an R naught of 18, transmits extremely quickly.

1:38:04.280 --> 1:38:05.800
 And now we have essentially,

1:38:05.800 --> 1:38:07.560
 let's say we had a whole human race

1:38:07.560 --> 1:38:10.400
 that is susceptible to measles.

1:38:10.400 --> 1:38:12.040
 And this is a virus that spreads

1:38:13.320 --> 1:38:16.100
 orders of magnitude easier than this current virus.

1:38:17.720 --> 1:38:20.960
 Imagine if you were to plug something toxic

1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:24.960
 or detrimental into that virus and release it to the world.

1:38:24.960 --> 1:38:29.360
 So it's possible to be both accidental and intentional.

1:38:29.360 --> 1:38:30.200
 Absolutely.

1:38:30.200 --> 1:38:32.560
 Yeah, so Mark Lipsitch is a good colleague of mine

1:38:32.560 --> 1:38:35.920
 at Harvard, we're both in the,

1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:37.000
 he's the director of the Center

1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:40.800
 for Communicable Disease Dynamics from a faculty member.

1:38:40.800 --> 1:38:42.960
 He's spoken very, very forcefully

1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:47.200
 and he's very outspoken about the dangers

1:38:47.200 --> 1:38:49.440
 of gain of function testing,

1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:53.440
 where in the lab we are intentionally creating viruses

1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:55.640
 that are exceedingly deadly

1:38:56.680 --> 1:38:59.240
 under the auspices of trying to learn about them.

1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:02.840
 So that if the idea is that if we kind of accelerate

1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:07.120
 evolution and make these really deadly viruses in the lab,

1:39:07.120 --> 1:39:11.240
 we can be prepared for if that virus ever comes about

1:39:11.240 --> 1:39:14.580
 naturally or through unnatural means.

1:39:14.580 --> 1:39:17.480
 The concern though is, okay, that's one thing,

1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:20.940
 but what if that virus got out on somebody's shoe?

1:39:20.940 --> 1:39:21.780
 Just what if?

1:39:24.840 --> 1:39:29.840
 If the effects of an accident are potentially catastrophic,

1:39:29.840 --> 1:39:33.580
 is it worth taking the chances just to be prepared

1:39:33.580 --> 1:39:34.900
 a little bit for something that may

1:39:34.900 --> 1:39:36.660
 or may not ever actually develop?

1:39:36.660 --> 1:39:40.300
 And so it's a serious ethical quandary we're in,

1:39:40.300 --> 1:39:43.060
 how to both be prepared,

1:39:43.060 --> 1:39:48.060
 but also not cause a catastrophic mistake.

1:39:49.700 --> 1:39:51.460
 As a small tangent,

1:39:51.460 --> 1:39:55.220
 there's a recent really exciting breakthrough of alpha two,

1:39:56.220 --> 1:39:59.300
 of alpha fold two solving protein folding

1:39:59.300 --> 1:40:00.940
 or achieving state of the art performance

1:40:00.940 --> 1:40:02.620
 on protein folding.

1:40:02.620 --> 1:40:07.620
 And then I thought proteins have a lot to do with viruses.

1:40:09.100 --> 1:40:14.100
 It seems like being able to use machine learning

1:40:14.620 --> 1:40:19.540
 to design proteins that achieve certain kinds of functions

1:40:19.540 --> 1:40:22.860
 will naturally allow you to use maybe down the line,

1:40:22.860 --> 1:40:26.380
 not yet, but allow you to use machine learning

1:40:26.380 --> 1:40:28.940
 to design basically viruses,

1:40:28.940 --> 1:40:31.220
 maybe like measles, like for good,

1:40:31.220 --> 1:40:35.820
 which is like to attack cancer cells, but also for bad.

1:40:37.620 --> 1:40:42.620
 Is that a crazy thought

1:40:43.460 --> 1:40:46.660
 or is this a natural place where this technology may go?

1:40:46.660 --> 1:40:48.580
 I suppose as all technologies can,

1:40:48.580 --> 1:40:52.020
 which is for good and for bad.

1:40:52.020 --> 1:40:54.060
 Do you think about the role of machine learning in this?

1:40:54.060 --> 1:40:59.060
 Oh yeah, absolutely, I mean, alpha fold is amazing.

1:40:59.420 --> 1:41:03.580
 It's an amazing algorithm, a series of algorithms.

1:41:03.580 --> 1:41:07.500
 And it does demonstrate, to me,

1:41:07.500 --> 1:41:10.620
 it demonstrates just how powerful,

1:41:10.620 --> 1:41:12.540
 everything in the world has rules.

1:41:12.540 --> 1:41:13.980
 We just don't know the rules.

1:41:13.980 --> 1:41:14.900
 We often don't know them,

1:41:14.900 --> 1:41:17.860
 but our brain has rules, how it works.

1:41:17.860 --> 1:41:19.220
 Everything is plus and minus.

1:41:19.220 --> 1:41:21.220
 There's nothing in the world that's really not

1:41:21.220 --> 1:41:25.260
 at its most basic level, positive, negative.

1:41:25.260 --> 1:41:28.180
 It's all, obviously, it's all just charge.

1:41:28.180 --> 1:41:30.300
 And that means everything.

1:41:30.300 --> 1:41:32.900
 You can figure it out with enough computational power

1:41:32.900 --> 1:41:34.980
 and enough, in this case, I mean,

1:41:34.980 --> 1:41:39.980
 machine learning and AI is just one way to learn rules.

1:41:40.060 --> 1:41:42.620
 It's an empirical way to learn rules,

1:41:42.620 --> 1:41:44.940
 but it's a profoundly powerful way.

1:41:44.940 --> 1:41:49.100
 And certainly, now that we are getting to a point

1:41:49.100 --> 1:41:52.780
 where we can take a protein and know how it folds,

1:41:54.180 --> 1:41:57.660
 given its sequence, we can reverse engineer that

1:41:57.660 --> 1:42:01.580
 and we can say, okay, we want a protein to fold this way.

1:42:01.580 --> 1:42:03.540
 What does the sequence need to be?

1:42:03.540 --> 1:42:06.340
 We haven't done that yet so much,

1:42:06.340 --> 1:42:09.500
 but it's just the next iteration of all of this.

1:42:09.500 --> 1:42:12.740
 And so let's say somebody wants to develop a virus

1:42:12.740 --> 1:42:15.340
 it's gonna start with somebody wanting to develop a virus

1:42:15.340 --> 1:42:18.620
 to defeat cancer, something good.

1:42:18.620 --> 1:42:20.780
 And so it would start with a lot of money

1:42:20.780 --> 1:42:25.140
 from the federal government for all the positives

1:42:25.140 --> 1:42:26.340
 that will come out of it.

1:42:27.300 --> 1:42:29.900
 But we have to be really careful

1:42:29.900 --> 1:42:32.300
 because that will come about.

1:42:32.300 --> 1:42:35.220
 There's no doubt in my mind that we will develop,

1:42:35.220 --> 1:42:36.060
 we're already doing it.

1:42:36.060 --> 1:42:39.460
 We engineer molecules all the time for specific uses.

1:42:39.460 --> 1:42:41.380
 Oftentimes, we take them from a lab

1:42:41.380 --> 1:42:44.140
 and then we take them from a lab and then we make them.

1:42:44.140 --> 1:42:47.100
 Oftentimes, we take them from nature and then tweak them.

1:42:48.220 --> 1:42:49.860
 But now we can supercharge it.

1:42:49.860 --> 1:42:53.340
 We can accelerate the pace of discovery.

1:42:53.340 --> 1:42:54.940
 To not have it just be discovery,

1:42:54.940 --> 1:42:58.180
 we have it be true ground up engineering.

1:42:58.180 --> 1:43:02.460
 Let's say you're trying to make a new molecule

1:43:02.460 --> 1:43:05.820
 to stabilize somebody with some retinal disease.

1:43:06.820 --> 1:43:08.900
 So we come up with some molecule

1:43:08.900 --> 1:43:12.180
 to stability of somebody with retinal degeneration.

1:43:14.780 --> 1:43:16.260
 Just a small tweak to that,

1:43:16.260 --> 1:43:18.460
 to say make a virus that causes the human race

1:43:18.460 --> 1:43:20.020
 to become blind.

1:43:20.020 --> 1:43:22.220
 I mean, it sounds really conspiracy theoryish,

1:43:22.220 --> 1:43:25.860
 but it's not.

1:43:25.860 --> 1:43:27.500
 We're learning so much about biology

1:43:27.500 --> 1:43:28.820
 and there's always nefarious reasons.

1:43:28.820 --> 1:43:33.820
 I mean, heck, look at how AI and just Google searches,

1:43:33.860 --> 1:43:37.820
 those can be, they are every single day

1:43:37.820 --> 1:43:39.940
 being leveraged by nefarious actors

1:43:39.940 --> 1:43:43.180
 to take advantage of people, to steal money,

1:43:43.180 --> 1:43:45.700
 to do whatever it might be.

1:43:45.700 --> 1:43:48.300
 Eventually, probably to create wars

1:43:48.300 --> 1:43:50.420
 or already to create wars.

1:43:50.420 --> 1:43:53.700
 And I mean, I don't think there's any question at this point

1:43:53.700 --> 1:43:55.500
 behind disinformation campaigns.

1:43:55.500 --> 1:43:56.900
 And so it's being leveraged.

1:43:56.900 --> 1:43:59.780
 This thing that could be wholly good

1:44:00.700 --> 1:44:02.260
 is always going to be leveraged for bad.

1:44:02.260 --> 1:44:04.580
 And so how do you balance that as a species?

1:44:04.580 --> 1:44:06.300
 I'm not quite sure.

1:44:06.300 --> 1:44:08.300
 The hope is, as you mentioned previously,

1:44:08.300 --> 1:44:10.460
 that there's some, that we were able

1:44:10.460 --> 1:44:12.300
 to also develop defense mechanisms.

1:44:12.300 --> 1:44:14.100
 And there's something about the human species

1:44:14.100 --> 1:44:18.700
 that seems to keep coming up with ways to,

1:44:18.700 --> 1:44:21.580
 just like on the deadline,

1:44:21.580 --> 1:44:22.780
 just at the last moment,

1:44:22.780 --> 1:44:26.420
 figuring out how to avoid destruction.

1:44:26.420 --> 1:44:30.940
 I think I'm eternally optimistic about the human race

1:44:30.940 --> 1:44:32.780
 not destroying ourselves,

1:44:32.780 --> 1:44:34.500
 but you could do a lot of things

1:44:34.500 --> 1:44:36.060
 that would be very painful.

1:44:36.060 --> 1:44:36.940
 Yes.

1:44:36.940 --> 1:44:38.980
 Well, we're doing it already, just,

1:44:38.980 --> 1:44:42.980
 I mean, we are seeing how our regulation today,

1:44:42.980 --> 1:44:45.860
 we did this thing, it started as a good thing,

1:44:45.860 --> 1:44:48.060
 regulation of medical products,

1:44:48.060 --> 1:44:53.060
 but now it is unwillingly and unintentionally harming us.

1:44:55.020 --> 1:44:57.220
 Our regulatory landscape,

1:44:57.220 --> 1:45:00.540
 which was developed totally for good in our country

1:45:00.540 --> 1:45:04.060
 is getting in the way of us deploying a tool

1:45:04.060 --> 1:45:06.900
 that could stop our economies

1:45:06.900 --> 1:45:11.020
 from having to be sort of sputteringly closed,

1:45:11.020 --> 1:45:12.940
 that could stop deaths from happening

1:45:12.940 --> 1:45:14.620
 at the rate that they are.

1:45:14.620 --> 1:45:19.340
 And it's, I think we will come to a solution.

1:45:19.340 --> 1:45:21.100
 Of course, now we're gonna get the vaccine

1:45:21.100 --> 1:45:23.220
 and it's gonna make people lose track

1:45:23.220 --> 1:45:25.940
 of like why we even bother testing, which is a bad idea.

1:45:25.940 --> 1:45:28.220
 But we're already seeing that.

1:45:28.220 --> 1:45:32.860
 We have this amazing capacity to both do damage

1:45:32.860 --> 1:45:34.820
 when we don't intend to do damage

1:45:36.060 --> 1:45:39.020
 and then also to pull up when we need to pull up

1:45:39.020 --> 1:45:41.460
 and stop complete catastrophe.

1:45:41.460 --> 1:45:46.100
 And so we are an interesting species in that way,

1:45:46.100 --> 1:45:47.580
 that's for sure.

1:45:47.580 --> 1:45:50.780
 So there's a lot of young folks, undergrads,

1:45:50.780 --> 1:45:54.180
 grads, they're also young, listen to this.

1:45:54.180 --> 1:45:57.540
 So is there, you've talked about a lot of fascinating stuff

1:45:57.540 --> 1:46:01.900
 that's like, there's ways that things are done

1:46:01.900 --> 1:46:03.540
 and there's actual solutions

1:46:03.540 --> 1:46:05.860
 and they're not always like intersecting.

1:46:05.860 --> 1:46:09.300
 Do you have advice for undergraduate students

1:46:09.300 --> 1:46:12.980
 or graduate students or even people in high school now

1:46:12.980 --> 1:46:17.780
 about a life, about a career of how they might be able

1:46:17.780 --> 1:46:20.060
 to solve real big problems in the world,

1:46:20.060 --> 1:46:22.140
 how they should live their life

1:46:22.140 --> 1:46:24.180
 in order to have a chance to solve big problems

1:46:24.180 --> 1:46:25.460
 in the world?

1:46:25.460 --> 1:46:26.300
 It's hard.

1:46:26.300 --> 1:46:28.580
 I struggle a little bit sometimes to give advice

1:46:28.580 --> 1:46:30.060
 because the advice that I give

1:46:30.060 --> 1:46:32.940
 from my own personal experience is necessarily distinct

1:46:32.940 --> 1:46:36.580
 from the advice that would make other people successful.

1:46:36.580 --> 1:46:41.580
 I have unending ambitions to make things better, I suppose.

1:46:42.300 --> 1:46:44.460
 And I don't see barricades

1:46:44.460 --> 1:46:46.980
 where other people sometimes see barricades.

1:46:48.260 --> 1:46:51.700
 Now, even just little things like when this virus started,

1:46:51.700 --> 1:46:54.420
 I'm a medical director at Brigham and Women's Hospital

1:46:54.420 --> 1:46:56.180
 and so I oversee or helped oversee

1:46:56.180 --> 1:46:58.100
 molecular virology diagnostics.

1:46:58.100 --> 1:47:01.180
 So when this virus started, wearing my epidemiology hat

1:47:01.180 --> 1:47:03.660
 and wearing my sort of viral outbreak hat,

1:47:03.660 --> 1:47:05.780
 I recognized that this is gonna be a big virus

1:47:05.780 --> 1:47:07.860
 that was important on a global level.

1:47:07.860 --> 1:47:10.140
 Even if the CDC and WHO weren't ready to admit

1:47:10.140 --> 1:47:10.980
 that it was a pandemic,

1:47:10.980 --> 1:47:14.100
 it was obvious in January that it was a pandemic.

1:47:14.100 --> 1:47:18.220
 So I started trying to get a test built at the Brigham,

1:47:18.220 --> 1:47:20.540
 which is one of Harvard's teaching hospitals.

1:47:20.540 --> 1:47:25.540
 The first encounters I had with the upper administration

1:47:25.540 --> 1:47:28.460
 of the hospital were pretty much, no, why would we do that?

1:47:28.460 --> 1:47:30.540
 That's silly, who are you?

1:47:30.540 --> 1:47:33.900
 And I said, well, okay, don't believe me, sure.

1:47:33.900 --> 1:47:35.780
 But I kept pushing on it.

1:47:35.780 --> 1:47:38.740
 And then eventually I got them to agree.

1:47:38.740 --> 1:47:40.700
 It was really only a couple of weeks

1:47:40.700 --> 1:47:43.060
 before the Biogen conference happened.

1:47:43.060 --> 1:47:44.460
 We started building the test.

1:47:44.460 --> 1:47:46.140
 I think they started looking abroad and saying,

1:47:46.140 --> 1:47:50.340
 okay, this is happening, sure, like, maybe he was right.

1:47:50.340 --> 1:47:52.900
 But then I went a step further and I said,

1:47:52.900 --> 1:47:55.740
 we're not gonna have enough tests at the hospital.

1:47:55.740 --> 1:47:59.540
 And so my ambition was to get a better testing program

1:47:59.540 --> 1:48:03.380
 started and so I figured what better place

1:48:03.380 --> 1:48:06.060
 to scale up testing than the Broad Institute.

1:48:06.060 --> 1:48:08.580
 Broad Institute is amazing, very high throughput,

1:48:08.580 --> 1:48:10.580
 high efficiency research institute

1:48:10.580 --> 1:48:13.460
 that does a lot of genomic sequencing, things like that.

1:48:13.460 --> 1:48:15.300
 So I went to the Broad and I said,

1:48:15.300 --> 1:48:17.340
 hey, there's this coronavirus

1:48:17.340 --> 1:48:20.700
 that's obviously gonna impact our society greatly.

1:48:20.700 --> 1:48:25.140
 Can we start modifying your high efficiency instruments

1:48:25.140 --> 1:48:27.780
 and robots for coronavirus testing?

1:48:27.780 --> 1:48:32.780
 Everyone in my orbit, in the hospital world,

1:48:33.340 --> 1:48:35.340
 just said, that's ridiculous.

1:48:35.340 --> 1:48:37.340
 How could you possibly plan to do that?

1:48:37.340 --> 1:48:38.620
 It's impossible.

1:48:38.620 --> 1:48:43.380
 And to me, it was like the most dead simple thing to do.

1:48:43.380 --> 1:48:46.300
 It didn't, but the higher ups and the people

1:48:46.300 --> 1:48:48.900
 who think about, I think one of the things

1:48:48.900 --> 1:48:51.420
 is to recognize that most people in the world

1:48:51.420 --> 1:48:53.620
 don't see solutions, they just see problems.

1:48:53.620 --> 1:48:55.980
 And it's because it's an easy thing to do.

1:48:55.980 --> 1:49:00.260
 Thinking of problems and how things will go wrong

1:49:00.260 --> 1:49:03.140
 is really easy because you're not coming up

1:49:03.140 --> 1:49:04.900
 with a brand new solution.

1:49:04.900 --> 1:49:07.100
 And this to me was just a super simple solution.

1:49:07.100 --> 1:49:09.500
 Hey, let's get the Broad to help build tests.

1:49:09.500 --> 1:49:12.700
 Every single hospital director told me no,

1:49:12.700 --> 1:49:13.540
 like it's impossible.

1:49:13.540 --> 1:49:16.620
 My own superiors, the ones I report to in the hospital,

1:49:16.620 --> 1:49:19.940
 said, you know, Mike, you're a new faculty member.

1:49:20.980 --> 1:49:23.540
 Your ideas probably would be right,

1:49:23.540 --> 1:49:27.620
 but you're too naive and young to know that it's impossible.

1:49:27.620 --> 1:49:30.540
 Obviously now the Broad is the highest

1:49:30.540 --> 1:49:32.380
 throughput laboratory in the country.

1:49:32.380 --> 1:49:37.020
 And so I think my recommendation to people

1:49:37.020 --> 1:49:40.260
 is as much as possible, get out of the mode

1:49:40.260 --> 1:49:42.980
 of thinking about things as problems.

1:49:42.980 --> 1:49:44.980
 Sometimes you piss people off,

1:49:44.980 --> 1:49:47.180
 I could probably use a better filter sometimes

1:49:47.180 --> 1:49:51.380
 to try to like be not so upfront with certain things.

1:49:51.380 --> 1:49:54.700
 But it's just so crucial to always just see,

1:49:54.700 --> 1:49:57.620
 to just bring it, like think about things in new ways

1:49:57.620 --> 1:49:59.380
 that other people haven't.

1:49:59.380 --> 1:50:01.300
 Cause usually there's something else out there.

1:50:01.300 --> 1:50:04.100
 And one of the things that has been most beneficial to me,

1:50:04.100 --> 1:50:07.940
 which is that my education was really broad.

1:50:07.940 --> 1:50:10.220
 It was engineering and physics.

1:50:10.220 --> 1:50:13.420
 And well, and then I became a Buddhist monk.

1:50:13.420 --> 1:50:15.900
 Well, and then I became a Buddhist monk for a while.

1:50:15.900 --> 1:50:18.540
 And so that gave me a different perspective,

1:50:18.540 --> 1:50:20.820
 but then it was medicine and immunology.

1:50:20.820 --> 1:50:23.100
 And now I've brought all of it together

1:50:23.100 --> 1:50:27.780
 from a mathematics and biology and medicine perspective

1:50:27.780 --> 1:50:29.100
 and policy and public health.

1:50:29.100 --> 1:50:30.180
 And I think that, you know,

1:50:30.180 --> 1:50:32.940
 I'm not the best in any one of these things.

1:50:32.940 --> 1:50:36.100
 I recognize that there are gonna be geniuses out there

1:50:36.100 --> 1:50:37.660
 who are just worlds better than me

1:50:37.660 --> 1:50:41.660
 at any one of these things that I try to work on.

1:50:41.660 --> 1:50:43.980
 But my superpower is bringing them all together,

1:50:43.980 --> 1:50:45.020
 you know, and just thinking,

1:50:45.020 --> 1:50:48.600
 and that's, I think how you can really change the world.

1:50:49.780 --> 1:50:51.540
 You know, I don't know that I'll ever change the world

1:50:51.540 --> 1:50:53.820
 in the way that I hope.

1:50:53.820 --> 1:50:55.340
 But that's how you can have a chance.

1:50:55.340 --> 1:50:57.100
 Yeah, that's how you can have a chance, exactly.

1:50:57.100 --> 1:51:01.380
 And I think it's also what, you know, this to me,

1:51:01.380 --> 1:51:02.700
 this rapid testing program,

1:51:02.700 --> 1:51:06.220
 like this is the most dead simple solution in the world.

1:51:06.220 --> 1:51:07.660
 And this literally could change the world.

1:51:07.660 --> 1:51:08.500
 It could change the world.

1:51:08.500 --> 1:51:09.620
 It could change, and it is, you know,

1:51:09.620 --> 1:51:11.180
 there's countries that are doing it now.

1:51:11.180 --> 1:51:13.980
 The US isn't, but I've been advising many countries on it.

1:51:13.980 --> 1:51:16.980
 And I would say that, you know,

1:51:16.980 --> 1:51:19.860
 some of the early papers that we put out earlier on,

1:51:19.860 --> 1:51:22.300
 a lot of the things actually are changing.

1:51:22.300 --> 1:51:24.180
 You don't always, unless you really look hard,

1:51:24.180 --> 1:51:26.740
 you don't know where you're actually having an effect.

1:51:26.740 --> 1:51:29.620
 Sometimes it's more overt than other times.

1:51:30.840 --> 1:51:33.260
 In April, I published a paper that was saying,

1:51:33.260 --> 1:51:36.580
 hey, with the PCR values from these tests,

1:51:36.580 --> 1:51:38.580
 we need to really focus on the CT values,

1:51:38.580 --> 1:51:39.860
 the actual quantitative values

1:51:39.860 --> 1:51:42.540
 of these lab based PCR tests.

1:51:42.540 --> 1:51:46.020
 At the time, all the physicians and laboratory directors

1:51:46.020 --> 1:51:46.980
 told me that was stupid.

1:51:46.980 --> 1:51:48.140
 You know, why would you do that?

1:51:48.140 --> 1:51:49.500
 They're not accurate enough.

1:51:49.500 --> 1:51:52.900
 And of course, now it's headline news that, you know,

1:51:52.900 --> 1:51:56.380
 Florida, they just mandated reporting out the CT values

1:51:56.380 --> 1:51:58.940
 of these tests, cause there's a real utility of them.

1:51:58.940 --> 1:52:00.500
 You can understand public health from it.

1:52:00.500 --> 1:52:03.580
 You can understand better clinical management.

1:52:03.580 --> 1:52:05.140
 You know, that was a simple solution

1:52:05.140 --> 1:52:07.440
 to a pretty difficult problem.

1:52:07.440 --> 1:52:09.000
 And it is changing.

1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:11.040
 The way that we approach all of the lab testing

1:52:11.040 --> 1:52:13.600
 in this country is starting to, it's taken a few months,

1:52:13.600 --> 1:52:15.560
 but it's starting to change because of that.

1:52:15.560 --> 1:52:18.360
 And, you know, that was just me saying,

1:52:18.360 --> 1:52:20.480
 hey, this is something we should be focusing on.

1:52:20.480 --> 1:52:22.840
 Got some other people involved and other people.

1:52:22.840 --> 1:52:26.200
 And now people recognize, hey, there's actual value

1:52:26.200 --> 1:52:29.200
 in this number that comes out of these lab based PCR tests.

1:52:29.200 --> 1:52:32.120
 So sometimes it does grow fairly quickly.

1:52:33.720 --> 1:52:35.360
 But I think the real answer,

1:52:35.360 --> 1:52:38.280
 if my only answer, I don't know what, you know,

1:52:38.280 --> 1:52:40.120
 I recognize that everyone, some people are gonna be

1:52:40.120 --> 1:52:45.120
 really focused on and have one small, but deep skillset.

1:52:45.120 --> 1:52:46.360
 I go the opposite direction.

1:52:46.360 --> 1:52:48.760
 I try to bring things together.

1:52:48.760 --> 1:52:52.200
 And, but the biggest thing I think is just,

1:52:52.200 --> 1:52:55.960
 don't see barriers, like just see,

1:52:55.960 --> 1:52:58.200
 like there's always a solution to a barrier.

1:52:58.200 --> 1:52:59.040
 If there's a barrier,

1:52:59.040 --> 1:53:01.480
 that literally means there's a solution to it.

1:53:01.480 --> 1:53:02.560
 That's why it's called a barrier.

1:53:02.560 --> 1:53:06.160
 And just like you said, most people will just present to you,

1:53:06.160 --> 1:53:09.320
 only be thinking about it and present to you with barriers.

1:53:09.320 --> 1:53:10.800
 And so it's easy to start thinking

1:53:10.800 --> 1:53:12.800
 that's all there is in this world.

1:53:12.800 --> 1:53:13.640
 And just think big.

1:53:13.640 --> 1:53:15.960
 I mean, God, you know, there's nothing wrong

1:53:15.960 --> 1:53:17.280
 with thinking big.

1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:19.040
 Elon Musk thought big and, you know,

1:53:19.040 --> 1:53:21.800
 and then thinking big builds on itself.

1:53:21.800 --> 1:53:25.240
 You know, you get a billion dollars from one big idea

1:53:25.240 --> 1:53:27.800
 and then that allows you to make three new big ideas.

1:53:27.800 --> 1:53:29.840
 And there's a hunger for it if you think big

1:53:29.840 --> 1:53:32.040
 and you communicate that vision with the world.

1:53:32.040 --> 1:53:35.240
 All the most brilliant and like passionate people

1:53:35.240 --> 1:53:37.720
 will just like, you'll attract them

1:53:37.720 --> 1:53:38.720
 and they'll come to you.

1:53:38.720 --> 1:53:41.440
 And then it makes your life actually really exciting.

1:53:41.440 --> 1:53:45.240
 The people I've met at like Tesla and Neuralink,

1:53:45.240 --> 1:53:47.200
 I mean, there's just like this fire in their eyes.

1:53:47.200 --> 1:53:48.200
 They just love life.

1:53:48.200 --> 1:53:52.200
 And it's amazing, I think, to be around those people.

1:53:53.520 --> 1:53:57.720
 I have to ask you about what was the philosophy,

1:53:57.720 --> 1:54:01.200
 the journey that took you to becoming a Buddhist monk

1:54:01.200 --> 1:54:06.200
 and what did you learn about life?

1:54:07.240 --> 1:54:09.080
 What did you take away from that experience?

1:54:09.080 --> 1:54:12.320
 How did you return back to Harvard

1:54:12.320 --> 1:54:17.320
 and the world that's unlike that experience, I imagine?

1:54:17.360 --> 1:54:19.520
 Yeah, well, I was at Dartmouth at the time.

1:54:22.280 --> 1:54:23.320
 Well, I went to Sri Lanka.

1:54:23.320 --> 1:54:25.800
 I was already pretty interested in developing countries

1:54:25.800 --> 1:54:27.440
 and sort of under resourced areas.

1:54:27.440 --> 1:54:30.680
 And I was doing a lot of engineering work

1:54:30.680 --> 1:54:33.440
 and I went there, but I was also starting to think

1:54:33.440 --> 1:54:35.760
 maybe health was something of interest.

1:54:37.440 --> 1:54:40.840
 And so I went to Sri Lanka

1:54:40.840 --> 1:54:43.520
 because I had a long interest in Buddhism as well,

1:54:43.520 --> 1:54:46.640
 just kind of interested in it as a thing.

1:54:46.640 --> 1:54:49.200
 Which aspect of the philosophy attracted you?

1:54:49.200 --> 1:54:52.520
 I would say that the thing that interested me most

1:54:52.520 --> 1:54:57.080
 was really this idea of kind of a butterfly effect

1:54:57.080 --> 1:55:02.080
 of like what you do now has ripple effects

1:55:02.520 --> 1:55:06.320
 that extend out beyond what you can possibly imagine,

1:55:07.800 --> 1:55:10.640
 both in your own life and in other people's lives.

1:55:10.640 --> 1:55:13.160
 And in some ways, Buddhism has, not in some ways,

1:55:13.160 --> 1:55:14.960
 in a pretty deep way, Buddhism has that

1:55:14.960 --> 1:55:18.800
 as part of its underlying philosophy

1:55:18.800 --> 1:55:23.000
 in terms of rebirth and sort of your actions today

1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:26.280
 propagate to others, but also propagate

1:55:26.280 --> 1:55:30.800
 to sort of what might happen in your circle

1:55:30.800 --> 1:55:32.640
 of what's called samsara and rebirth.

1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:36.640
 And I don't know that I subscribe fully

1:55:36.640 --> 1:55:39.880
 to this idea that we are reborn,

1:55:39.880 --> 1:55:44.840
 which always was a little bit of a debate internally,

1:55:44.840 --> 1:55:46.360
 I suppose, when I was a monk.

1:55:47.760 --> 1:55:50.480
 But it has always been, it was that

1:55:50.480 --> 1:55:52.560
 and then it was also meditation.

1:55:52.560 --> 1:55:55.440
 At the time I was a fairly elite rower.

1:55:55.440 --> 1:55:57.880
 I was rowing at the national level

1:55:57.880 --> 1:56:01.640
 and rowing to me was very meditative.

1:56:01.640 --> 1:56:06.640
 It was just, even if you're in a boat with other people,

1:56:07.720 --> 1:56:09.560
 I mean, on the one hand, it's like the extreme

1:56:09.560 --> 1:56:13.160
 of like a team sport, but it's also the extreme

1:56:13.160 --> 1:56:16.800
 sort of focus and concentration that's required of it.

1:56:16.800 --> 1:56:18.880
 And so I was always really into just meditative

1:56:18.880 --> 1:56:19.720
 type of things.

1:56:19.720 --> 1:56:20.920
 I was doing a lot of pottery too,

1:56:20.920 --> 1:56:22.480
 which was also very meditative.

1:56:22.480 --> 1:56:25.720
 And so Buddhism just kind of really,

1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:28.440
 there are a lot of things about meditating

1:56:28.440 --> 1:56:30.480
 that just appealed.

1:56:30.480 --> 1:56:32.400
 And so I moved to Sri Lanka,

1:56:32.400 --> 1:56:35.680
 planning to only be there for a couple of months.

1:56:35.680 --> 1:56:37.760
 And then I was shadowing in this medical clinic

1:56:37.760 --> 1:56:40.360
 and there was this physician who was just really,

1:56:40.360 --> 1:56:43.080
 I mean, it's just kind of a horrible situation.

1:56:43.080 --> 1:56:46.040
 Frankly, this guy was trained decades earlier.

1:56:46.040 --> 1:56:49.600
 He was an older physician and he was still just practicing

1:56:49.600 --> 1:56:52.520
 like these fairly barbaric approaches to medicine

1:56:52.520 --> 1:56:54.680
 because he was a rural town

1:56:55.560 --> 1:56:57.240
 and he just didn't have a lot of,

1:56:58.680 --> 1:57:00.680
 he didn't have any updated training, frankly.

1:57:00.680 --> 1:57:03.680
 And so, I just remember this like girl came in

1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:05.920
 with like shrapnel in her hand

1:57:05.920 --> 1:57:08.760
 and his solution was to like air it out.

1:57:08.760 --> 1:57:12.440
 And so he was like, without even numbing her hand,

1:57:12.440 --> 1:57:16.680
 he was like cutting it open more with this idea

1:57:16.680 --> 1:57:20.040
 that like the more oxygen and stuff.

1:57:20.040 --> 1:57:23.000
 And it just, I think there was something about all of this.

1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:25.520
 And I was already talking to these monks at the time.

1:57:25.520 --> 1:57:28.760
 I would be in this clinic in the morning and I'd go

1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:31.520
 and my idea was to teach English

1:57:31.520 --> 1:57:33.080
 to these monks in the evening.

1:57:34.320 --> 1:57:37.080
 Turned out I'm a really bad English teacher.

1:57:37.080 --> 1:57:40.440
 So they just taught, they allowed me just to sit with them

1:57:40.440 --> 1:57:42.960
 and meditate and they were teaching me more about Buddhism

1:57:42.960 --> 1:57:44.800
 than I could have possibly taught them about English

1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:46.720
 or being an American or something.

1:57:50.720 --> 1:57:52.800
 And so I just slowly, I just couldn't take,

1:57:52.800 --> 1:57:55.240
 I like couldn't handle being in that clinic.

1:57:55.240 --> 1:57:57.320
 So more and more, I just started moving to,

1:57:57.320 --> 1:57:59.440
 spending more and more time at this monastery.

1:57:59.440 --> 1:58:00.760
 And then after about two months,

1:58:00.760 --> 1:58:02.200
 I was supposed to come back to the States

1:58:02.200 --> 1:58:04.160
 and I decided I didn't want to.

1:58:04.160 --> 1:58:06.400
 So I moved to this monastery in the mountains

1:58:07.480 --> 1:58:09.160
 primarily because I didn't have the money

1:58:09.160 --> 1:58:11.200
 to like just keep living.

1:58:11.200 --> 1:58:13.560
 So living in a monastery is free.

1:58:13.560 --> 1:58:16.240
 And so I moved there and just started meditating

1:58:16.240 --> 1:58:17.680
 more and more and then months went by

1:58:17.680 --> 1:58:22.160
 and it just really gravitated.

1:58:22.160 --> 1:58:24.840
 I gravitated to the whole notion of it.

1:58:24.840 --> 1:58:28.440
 I mean, it became, it sounds strange,

1:58:28.440 --> 1:58:30.720
 but meditating almost just like anything

1:58:30.720 --> 1:58:34.600
 that you've put your mind to became exciting.

1:58:34.600 --> 1:58:36.520
 It became like there weren't enough hours

1:58:36.520 --> 1:58:38.120
 in the day to meditate.

1:58:38.120 --> 1:58:41.800
 And I would do it for 18 hours a day, 15 hours a day,

1:58:41.800 --> 1:58:46.160
 just sit there and you, and like,

1:58:46.160 --> 1:58:48.520
 I mean, I hate sleeping anyway,

1:58:48.520 --> 1:58:49.880
 but I wouldn't want to go to sleep

1:58:49.880 --> 1:58:51.440
 because I felt like I didn't accomplish

1:58:51.440 --> 1:58:54.120
 what I needed to accomplish in meditation that day,

1:58:54.120 --> 1:58:57.000
 which is so strange because there is no end,

1:58:57.000 --> 1:58:59.000
 but it was always, but there are these,

1:59:00.520 --> 1:59:02.800
 there are these steps that happen during meditation

1:59:02.800 --> 1:59:05.160
 that are very prescribed in a way.

1:59:05.160 --> 1:59:08.080
 Buddha talked about them and these are ancient writings,

1:59:08.080 --> 1:59:08.920
 which exist.

1:59:08.920 --> 1:59:09.840
 I mean, the writings are real.

1:59:09.840 --> 1:59:11.240
 They're thousands of years old now.

1:59:11.240 --> 1:59:16.240
 And so whether it was Buddha writing them or whoever,

1:59:16.640 --> 1:59:17.760
 there are lots of different people

1:59:17.760 --> 1:59:20.600
 who have contributed to these writings over the years.

1:59:22.200 --> 1:59:23.520
 But they're very prescribed

1:59:23.520 --> 1:59:26.880
 and they tell you what you're gonna go through.

1:59:26.880 --> 1:59:29.040
 And I didn't really focus too much on them.

1:59:30.120 --> 1:59:31.240
 I read a little bit about them,

1:59:31.240 --> 1:59:32.400
 but your mind really does.

1:59:32.400 --> 1:59:35.160
 When you actually start meditating at that level,

1:59:35.160 --> 1:59:36.440
 like not an hour here and there,

1:59:36.440 --> 1:59:39.560
 but like truly just spending your day as meditating,

1:59:39.560 --> 1:59:42.320
 it becomes kind of like this other world

1:59:42.320 --> 1:59:47.320
 where it becomes exciting and you're actively working,

1:59:47.760 --> 1:59:49.400
 you're actively meditating,

1:59:49.400 --> 1:59:51.200
 not just kind of trying to quiet things.

1:59:51.200 --> 1:59:53.360
 That's sort of just the first stage

1:59:53.360 --> 1:59:54.960
 of trying to get your mind to focus.

1:59:54.960 --> 1:59:56.800
 Most people never get past that first stage,

1:59:56.800 --> 1:59:58.680
 especially in our culture.

1:59:58.680 --> 2:00:00.560
 Could you briefly summarize

2:00:00.560 --> 2:00:03.960
 what's waiting beyond the stage of just quieting the mind?

2:00:05.560 --> 2:00:08.320
 It's hard for me to imagine that there's something

2:00:08.320 --> 2:00:12.320
 that could be described as exciting on there.

2:00:12.320 --> 2:00:14.600
 Yeah, it's an interesting question.

2:00:14.600 --> 2:00:18.080
 So I would say, so the first thing,

2:00:18.080 --> 2:00:20.360
 the first step is truly just to like be able

2:00:20.360 --> 2:00:23.040
 to close your eyes, focus on your breath

2:00:23.040 --> 2:00:26.240
 and not have other thoughts enter into your mind.

2:00:26.240 --> 2:00:28.320
 That alone is just so hard to do.

2:00:28.320 --> 2:00:33.320
 Like I couldn't do it now if I wanted, but I could then.

2:00:33.320 --> 2:00:38.320
 But once you get past that stage,

2:00:38.520 --> 2:00:41.600
 you start entering into like all these other,

2:00:41.600 --> 2:00:42.520
 you go through the kind of,

2:00:42.520 --> 2:00:44.640
 I went through this like pretty trippy stage,

2:00:44.640 --> 2:00:46.240
 which is a little bit euphoric

2:00:47.600 --> 2:00:49.800
 where you just kind of start not hallucinating.

2:00:49.800 --> 2:00:51.440
 I mean, it wasn't like some crazy thing

2:00:51.440 --> 2:00:53.080
 that would happen in a movie,

2:00:53.080 --> 2:00:55.320
 but definitely just weird.

2:00:55.320 --> 2:00:56.720
 You start getting into the stage

2:00:56.720 --> 2:01:01.720
 where you're able to quiet your mind for so long,

2:01:01.720 --> 2:01:04.640
 for hours at a time that like for me,

2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:07.640
 I started getting really excited

2:01:07.640 --> 2:01:09.640
 about this idea of mindfulness,

2:01:09.640 --> 2:01:11.760
 which is part of Buddhism in general,

2:01:11.760 --> 2:01:13.760
 but it's part of Theravada Buddhism in particular

2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:18.160
 for this in this way, which was you take,

2:01:19.400 --> 2:01:21.600
 you start focusing on your daily activities,

2:01:21.600 --> 2:01:25.280
 whether that's sipping a cup of tea or walking

2:01:25.280 --> 2:01:29.520
 or sweeping around.

2:01:29.520 --> 2:01:32.360
 I lived on this mountainside in this cottage thing,

2:01:32.360 --> 2:01:33.440
 it was built into the rock.

2:01:33.440 --> 2:01:36.280
 And so every morning I would wake up early

2:01:36.280 --> 2:01:37.600
 and sweep around it and stuff,

2:01:37.600 --> 2:01:39.160
 cause that's just what we did.

2:01:40.760 --> 2:01:44.000
 And you start to, you meditate on all those activities.

2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:46.240
 And one of the things that was so exciting,

2:01:46.240 --> 2:01:48.720
 which sounds completely ridiculous now

2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:53.720
 was just almost learning about your daily activities

2:01:54.200 --> 2:01:56.880
 in ways that you never would have thought about before.

2:01:56.880 --> 2:02:01.880
 So what's involved with like picking up this glass of water?

2:02:03.640 --> 2:02:05.120
 If I said, okay, I'm just gonna pick,

2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:06.840
 I'm gonna take a drink of water,

2:02:06.840 --> 2:02:09.160
 to me right now, it's a single activity.

2:02:10.800 --> 2:02:15.800
 But during meditation, it's not a single activity.

2:02:16.360 --> 2:02:18.160
 It's a whole series of activities

2:02:18.160 --> 2:02:21.960
 of like little engineering feats and feelings.

2:02:21.960 --> 2:02:24.240
 And it's gripping the water

2:02:24.240 --> 2:02:25.960
 and it's feeling that the glass is cold

2:02:25.960 --> 2:02:29.280
 and it's lifting and it's moving and dragging and dragging.

2:02:29.280 --> 2:02:34.200
 And you start to learn a whole new language of life.

2:02:34.200 --> 2:02:37.560
 And that to me was like this really exhilarating thing

2:02:37.560 --> 2:02:41.320
 that it was an exhilarating component of meditation

2:02:41.320 --> 2:02:43.680
 that there was never enough time.

2:02:44.520 --> 2:02:46.360
 It's kind of like learning a new computer language.

2:02:46.360 --> 2:02:48.280
 Like it gets really exciting when you start coding

2:02:48.280 --> 2:02:50.480
 and all these new things you can do.

2:02:50.480 --> 2:02:55.400
 You learn how to experience life in a much richer way.

2:02:55.400 --> 2:02:57.000
 And so you never run out of ways

2:02:57.000 --> 2:02:58.840
 to go deeper and deeper and deeper

2:02:58.840 --> 2:03:00.480
 in the way you experienced even just

2:03:00.480 --> 2:03:02.360
 the drinking of the glass of water.

2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:03.280
 That's exactly right.

2:03:03.280 --> 2:03:05.040
 And what becomes kind of exhilarating

2:03:05.040 --> 2:03:07.640
 is you start to be able to predict things

2:03:07.640 --> 2:03:09.280
 that you never are,

2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:11.180
 I don't even have predictions, right word.

2:03:11.180 --> 2:03:13.000
 But I always think of the matrix,

2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:15.200
 where I forget who it was,

2:03:15.200 --> 2:03:17.880
 somebody was shooting at Neo

2:03:17.880 --> 2:03:21.080
 and he like leans backwards and he dodges the bullets.

2:03:22.840 --> 2:03:24.420
 In some ways, when you start breaking

2:03:24.420 --> 2:03:26.200
 every little action that your hands do

2:03:26.200 --> 2:03:27.800
 or that your feet do or that your body does

2:03:27.800 --> 2:03:29.520
 down into all these little actions

2:03:29.520 --> 2:03:33.340
 that make up one what we normally think of as an action,

2:03:33.340 --> 2:03:35.360
 all of a sudden you can start to see things

2:03:35.360 --> 2:03:37.080
 almost in slow motion.

2:03:37.080 --> 2:03:40.280
 I like to think of it very much like language.

2:03:40.280 --> 2:03:42.720
 The first time somebody hears a foreign language,

2:03:44.360 --> 2:03:45.960
 it sounds really fast usually.

2:03:45.960 --> 2:03:48.960
 You don't hear the spaces between words.

2:03:48.960 --> 2:03:53.960
 And it just sounds like a stream of consciousness.

2:03:53.960 --> 2:03:55.680
 And it just sounds like a stream of noises

2:03:55.680 --> 2:03:57.040
 if you've never heard the language before.

2:03:57.040 --> 2:03:58.740
 And as you learn the language,

2:03:58.740 --> 2:04:01.200
 you hear clear breaks between words

2:04:01.200 --> 2:04:02.800
 and it starts to gain context.

2:04:02.800 --> 2:04:04.320
 And all of a sudden like that,

2:04:04.320 --> 2:04:09.320
 what once sounded very fast slows down and it has meaning.

2:04:10.160 --> 2:04:11.440
 That's our whole life.

2:04:11.440 --> 2:04:13.040
 Well, there's this whole language happening

2:04:13.040 --> 2:04:15.540
 that we don't speak generally.

2:04:15.540 --> 2:04:17.140
 But if you start to speak it

2:04:17.140 --> 2:04:19.840
 and if you start to learn it and you start to say,

2:04:19.840 --> 2:04:21.060
 hey, I'm picking up this glass

2:04:21.060 --> 2:04:24.060
 is actually 18 little movements.

2:04:24.060 --> 2:04:27.280
 Then all of a sudden it becomes extremely exciting

2:04:27.280 --> 2:04:29.460
 and exhilarating to just breathe.

2:04:29.460 --> 2:04:31.640
 Breathing alone and the rise and fall of your abdomen

2:04:31.640 --> 2:04:34.120
 or the way the air pushes in and out of your nose

2:04:34.120 --> 2:04:36.640
 becomes almost interesting.

2:04:37.640 --> 2:04:41.520
 And what's really neat is the world just starts slowing down

2:04:41.520 --> 2:04:44.120
 and I'll never forget that feeling.

2:04:44.120 --> 2:04:47.140
 And if there was one euphoric feeling from meditation

2:04:47.140 --> 2:04:48.960
 I want to gain back,

2:04:48.960 --> 2:04:51.560
 but I don't think I could without really meditating

2:04:51.560 --> 2:04:54.400
 like that again and I don't think I will,

2:04:54.400 --> 2:04:57.040
 was this like slow motion of the world.

2:04:57.040 --> 2:05:01.440
 It was finding the spaces between all the movements

2:05:01.440 --> 2:05:04.680
 in the same way that the spaces between all the words happen.

2:05:04.680 --> 2:05:06.960
 And then it almost gives you this new appreciation

2:05:06.960 --> 2:05:10.160
 for everything, it was really amazing.

2:05:10.160 --> 2:05:14.240
 And so I think it came to an abrupt end though

2:05:14.240 --> 2:05:15.440
 when the tsunami hit.

2:05:15.440 --> 2:05:19.580
 I was there in the Indian Ocean tsunami hit in 2004.

2:05:19.580 --> 2:05:22.220
 And it was like this dichotomy of being a monk

2:05:22.220 --> 2:05:26.640
 and just meditating in this extraordinary place.

2:05:28.040 --> 2:05:30.700
 And then the tsunami hits and kills 40,000 people

2:05:30.700 --> 2:05:32.280
 in a few minutes on the coast

2:05:32.280 --> 2:05:34.920
 of this really small little country in Sri Lanka.

2:05:34.920 --> 2:05:39.920
 And then my whole world of being a monk

2:05:40.440 --> 2:05:41.820
 came crashing down.

2:05:41.820 --> 2:05:46.160
 And when I go to the coast,

2:05:46.160 --> 2:05:51.160
 and I mean, that was just a devastating visual sight

2:05:53.420 --> 2:05:54.520
 and emotional sight.

2:05:54.520 --> 2:05:56.540
 But the strangest thing happened,

2:05:56.540 --> 2:05:59.620
 which was that everyone just wanted me to stay as a monk.

2:05:59.620 --> 2:06:02.500
 You know, people in that culture, they wanted to,

2:06:03.780 --> 2:06:07.140
 the monks largely fled from the coastlines those,

2:06:07.140 --> 2:06:09.740
 you know, and so then there I was

2:06:09.740 --> 2:06:11.300
 and people wanted me to be a monk.

2:06:11.300 --> 2:06:12.300
 They wanted me to stay on the coast,

2:06:12.300 --> 2:06:14.420
 but be a monk and not help,

2:06:14.420 --> 2:06:17.700
 like not help in the way that I considered helping.

2:06:18.740 --> 2:06:20.560
 They wanted me just to keep meditating

2:06:20.560 --> 2:06:23.380
 so that they could bring me offerings

2:06:23.380 --> 2:06:27.000
 and have their sort of karmic responsibilities

2:06:28.460 --> 2:06:29.380
 attended to as well.

2:06:29.380 --> 2:06:32.540
 And so that was really bizarre to me.

2:06:32.540 --> 2:06:36.420
 It was like, how could I possibly just sit around

2:06:36.420 --> 2:06:40.300
 while all these people, half of everyone's family just died?

2:06:40.300 --> 2:06:44.060
 And so in any case, I stopped being a monk

2:06:44.060 --> 2:06:45.540
 and I moved to this refugee camp

2:06:45.540 --> 2:06:47.420
 and lived there for another six months or so

2:06:47.420 --> 2:06:52.420
 and just stayed there, not as a monk,

2:06:54.580 --> 2:06:56.620
 but tried to raise some money from the US

2:06:56.620 --> 2:06:58.920
 and tried to like, I didn't know what I was doing.

2:06:58.920 --> 2:07:01.260
 Frankly, I was 22.

2:07:03.460 --> 2:07:06.180
 And I don't think I appreciated at the time

2:07:06.180 --> 2:07:10.520
 how much of a role I was having in that community's life.

2:07:10.520 --> 2:07:14.660
 But it's taken me many years to process all of this

2:07:14.660 --> 2:07:17.580
 since then, but I would say it's what put me

2:07:17.580 --> 2:07:21.100
 into the public health world, living in that refugee camp.

2:07:21.100 --> 2:07:22.900
 And that difference that happened,

2:07:22.900 --> 2:07:26.900
 from being a monk to being in this devastating environment

2:07:28.300 --> 2:07:30.140
 just really changed my whole view

2:07:30.140 --> 2:07:34.680
 of sort of why I was existing, I suppose.

2:07:34.680 --> 2:07:39.680
 Well, so there's this richness of life

2:07:40.060 --> 2:07:42.700
 in a single drink of water that you experience,

2:07:42.700 --> 2:07:46.180
 and then there's this power of nature

2:07:46.180 --> 2:07:50.100
 that's capable to take the lives of thousands of people.

2:07:50.100 --> 2:07:52.520
 So given all that, the absurdity of that,

2:07:54.020 --> 2:07:58.180
 let me ask you, and the fact that you study things

2:07:58.180 --> 2:08:01.220
 that could kill the entirety of human civilization,

2:08:01.220 --> 2:08:03.860
 what do you think is the meaning of this all?

2:08:03.860 --> 2:08:05.540
 What do you think is the meaning of life,

2:08:05.540 --> 2:08:08.060
 this whole orchestra we've got going on?

2:08:08.060 --> 2:08:09.940
 Does it have a meaning?

2:08:09.940 --> 2:08:12.700
 And maybe from another perspective,

2:08:15.020 --> 2:08:19.120
 how does one live a meaningful life, if such is possible?

2:08:22.500 --> 2:08:24.560
 Well, from what I've seen,

2:08:26.100 --> 2:08:29.060
 I don't think there's a single answer to that by any stretch.

2:08:29.060 --> 2:08:32.300
 One of the most interesting things about Buddhism to me

2:08:32.300 --> 2:08:35.860
 is that the human existence is part of suffering,

2:08:36.860 --> 2:08:40.980
 which is very different from Judeo Christian existence,

2:08:40.980 --> 2:08:45.980
 which is that human existence is something to be,

2:08:47.620 --> 2:08:50.220
 is a very different, it's something to,

2:08:50.220 --> 2:08:51.740
 there's a richness to it.

2:08:51.740 --> 2:08:55.460
 In Buddhism, it's just another one of your lives,

2:08:55.460 --> 2:08:59.660
 but it's your opportunity to attain nirvana

2:08:59.660 --> 2:09:02.420
 and become a monk, for example, and meditate

2:09:02.420 --> 2:09:03.500
 to attain nirvana,

2:09:04.580 --> 2:09:06.820
 else you kind of just go back into the samsara,

2:09:06.820 --> 2:09:09.180
 the cycle of suffering.

2:09:09.180 --> 2:09:14.180
 And so, when I look at, I mean, in some ways,

2:09:14.180 --> 2:09:17.960
 the notion of life and what the purpose of life is,

2:09:18.860 --> 2:09:20.940
 they're kind of completely distinct,

2:09:20.940 --> 2:09:22.980
 this sort of Western view of life,

2:09:22.980 --> 2:09:27.220
 which is that this life is the most precious thing

2:09:27.220 --> 2:09:30.460
 in the world versus this is just another opportunity

2:09:30.460 --> 2:09:33.300
 to try to get out of life.

2:09:33.300 --> 2:09:35.880
 I mean, the whole notion of nirvana, and in Buddhism,

2:09:35.880 --> 2:09:40.100
 it getting out of this sort of cycle of suffering

2:09:40.100 --> 2:09:41.380
 is to vanish.

2:09:41.380 --> 2:09:45.680
 If you could attain nirvana throughout this life,

2:09:45.680 --> 2:09:48.660
 the idea is that you don't get reborn.

2:09:48.660 --> 2:09:51.340
 And so, when I look at these two,

2:09:51.340 --> 2:09:55.100
 on the one hand, you have Christian faith

2:09:55.100 --> 2:09:57.160
 and other things that want to go to heaven

2:09:57.160 --> 2:09:58.920
 and live forever in heaven.

2:09:58.920 --> 2:10:01.260
 Then you have this other whole half of humans

2:10:01.260 --> 2:10:05.740
 who want nothing more than to get out of the cycle

2:10:05.740 --> 2:10:09.100
 of rebirth and just, poof, not exist anymore.

2:10:09.100 --> 2:10:10.300
 The cycle of suffering, yeah.

2:10:10.300 --> 2:10:12.500
 Yeah, and so how do you reconcile those two?

2:10:12.500 --> 2:10:13.620
 And I guess.

2:10:13.620 --> 2:10:15.760
 Do you have both of them in you?

2:10:15.760 --> 2:10:18.020
 Do you basically oscillate back and forth?

2:10:18.020 --> 2:10:19.860
 I don't think I, I think I just,

2:10:19.860 --> 2:10:23.080
 I look at us and I think we're just a bunch of proteins.

2:10:23.080 --> 2:10:28.080
 That we form and we, they work in this really amazing way

2:10:29.560 --> 2:10:31.400
 and they might work in a bigger scale.

2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:33.800
 There might be some connections

2:10:33.800 --> 2:10:35.400
 that we're not really clear about,

2:10:35.400 --> 2:10:36.560
 but they're still biological.

2:10:36.560 --> 2:10:38.360
 I believe that they're biological.

2:10:38.360 --> 2:10:40.600
 How did these proteins become conscious

2:10:40.600 --> 2:10:43.600
 and why do they want to help civilization

2:10:43.600 --> 2:10:47.640
 by having at home rapid tests at scale?

2:10:47.640 --> 2:10:50.840
 Well, I think, I don't have an answer to that one,

2:10:50.840 --> 2:10:53.440
 but I really do believe. I was hoping you would.

2:10:53.440 --> 2:10:56.320
 It's just, you know, this is just an evolution

2:10:56.320 --> 2:11:01.320
 of consciousness I don't, I don't personally think is,

2:11:02.440 --> 2:11:05.400
 my feeling is that we're a bunch of pluses and minuses

2:11:05.400 --> 2:11:07.160
 that have just gotten so complex

2:11:07.160 --> 2:11:10.880
 that they're able to make rich feelings, rich emotions.

2:11:10.880 --> 2:11:13.680
 And I do believe though, you know, on the one hand,

2:11:13.680 --> 2:11:15.760
 I sometimes wake up some days,

2:11:16.880 --> 2:11:18.700
 my fiance doesn't always love it,

2:11:18.700 --> 2:11:20.160
 but you know, I kind of think we're all just a bunch

2:11:20.160 --> 2:11:23.400
 of robots with like pretty complicated algorithms

2:11:23.400 --> 2:11:24.320
 that we deal with.

2:11:26.440 --> 2:11:28.680
 And, you know, in that sense, like, okay,

2:11:28.680 --> 2:11:30.960
 if the world just blew up tomorrow

2:11:30.960 --> 2:11:35.360
 and nothing existed the day after that,

2:11:35.360 --> 2:11:37.920
 it's just another blip in the universe, you know?

2:11:37.920 --> 2:11:40.100
 But at the same time, I don't know.

2:11:40.100 --> 2:11:42.460
 So that's kind of probably my most core basic feeling

2:11:42.460 --> 2:11:45.520
 about life is like, we're just a blip

2:11:45.520 --> 2:11:47.320
 and we may as well make the most of it

2:11:47.320 --> 2:11:48.620
 while we're here blipping.

2:11:48.620 --> 2:11:52.280
 It's one hell of a fun blip though.

2:11:52.280 --> 2:11:57.280
 It is, it's an amazing blink of an eye in time.

2:11:59.120 --> 2:12:01.640
 Michael, this is, you're one of the most interesting people

2:12:01.640 --> 2:12:03.920
 I've met, one of the most interesting conversations,

2:12:03.920 --> 2:12:07.400
 important ones now, I'm going to publish it very soon.

2:12:07.400 --> 2:12:09.720
 I really appreciate taking the time,

2:12:09.720 --> 2:12:12.920
 I know how busy you are, it was really fun.

2:12:12.920 --> 2:12:14.100
 Thanks for talking today.

2:12:14.100 --> 2:12:16.440
 Well, thanks so much, this was a lot of fun.

2:12:16.440 --> 2:12:19.420
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:12:19.420 --> 2:12:22.260
 with Michael Mina and thank you to our sponsors.

2:12:22.260 --> 2:12:25.220
 Brave, a fast browser that feels like Chrome

2:12:25.220 --> 2:12:27.860
 but has more privacy preserving features.

2:12:27.860 --> 2:12:30.460
 Athletic Greens, the all in one drink

2:12:30.460 --> 2:12:32.320
 that I start every day with to cover

2:12:32.320 --> 2:12:34.100
 all my nutritional bases.

2:12:34.100 --> 2:12:37.140
 ExpressVPN, the VPN I've used for many years

2:12:37.140 --> 2:12:39.240
 to protect my privacy on the internet.

2:12:39.240 --> 2:12:42.660
 And Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends.

2:12:42.660 --> 2:12:45.380

 And now, let me leave you with some words

2:13:01.940 --> 2:13:03.800
 from Teddy Roosevelt.

2:13:03.800 --> 2:13:05.880
 It is not the critic who counts.

2:13:06.780 --> 2:13:10.180
 Not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles

2:13:10.180 --> 2:13:13.620
 or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.

2:13:13.620 --> 2:13:17.860
 The credit belongs to the man who actually is in the arena,

2:13:17.860 --> 2:13:21.260
 whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood,

2:13:21.260 --> 2:13:24.500
 who strives valiantly, who errs,

2:13:24.500 --> 2:13:27.180
 who comes short again and again,

2:13:27.180 --> 2:13:30.700
 because there is no effort without error and shortcoming,

2:13:30.700 --> 2:13:33.780
 but who does actually strive to do the deeds,

2:13:33.780 --> 2:13:37.460
 who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions,

2:13:37.460 --> 2:13:40.260
 who spends himself in a worthy cause,

2:13:40.260 --> 2:13:43.580
 who at the best knows in the end that triumph

2:13:43.580 --> 2:13:47.380
 of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails,

2:13:47.380 --> 2:13:50.560
 at least fails while daring greatly,

2:13:50.560 --> 2:13:53.220
 so that his place shall never be

2:13:53.220 --> 2:13:55.460
 with those cold and timid souls

2:13:55.460 --> 2:13:58.060
 who neither know victory nor defeat.

2:13:58.060 --> 2:14:10.060
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
