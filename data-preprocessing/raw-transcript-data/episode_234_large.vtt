00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
 The following is a conversation with Stephen Wolfram, his third time on the podcast.

00:04.880 --> 00:10.240
 He's a computer scientist, mathematician, theoretical physicist, and the founder of

00:10.240 --> 00:16.560
 Wolfram Research, a company behind Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram Language, and the new

00:16.560 --> 00:22.800
 Wolfram Physics Project. This conversation is a wild technical roller coaster ride

00:22.800 --> 00:28.160
 through topics of complexity, mathematics, physics, computing, and consciousness.

00:28.160 --> 00:34.400
 I think this is what this podcast is becoming, a wild ride. Some episodes are about physics,

00:34.400 --> 00:40.400
 some about robots, some are about war and power, some are about the human condition

00:40.400 --> 00:46.480
 and our search for meaning, and some are just what the comedian Tim Dillon calls fun.

00:47.680 --> 00:52.800
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, to support it please check out the sponsors in the description,

00:52.800 --> 00:56.480
 and now here's my conversation with Stephen Wolfram.

00:56.480 --> 00:57.680
 Stephen.

00:57.680 --> 01:03.120
 Almost 20 years ago, you published A New Kind of Science, where you presented a study of

01:03.120 --> 01:10.160
 complexity and an approach for modeling of complex systems. So, let us return again to

01:10.160 --> 01:15.360
 the core idea of complexity. What is complexity?

01:15.360 --> 01:19.200
 I don't know, I think that's not the most interesting question. It's like,

01:19.200 --> 01:24.560
 you know, if you ask a biologist what is life, that's not the question they care the most about.

01:24.560 --> 01:31.440
 But what I was interested in is, how does something that we would usually identify as

01:31.440 --> 01:35.920
 complexity arise in nature? And I got interested in that question like 50 years ago, which is

01:35.920 --> 01:41.920
 really embarrassingly long time ago. And, you know, I was, you know, how does snowflakes get

01:41.920 --> 01:47.680
 to have complicated forms? How do galaxies get to have complicated shapes? How do living systems

01:47.680 --> 01:52.560
 get produced? Things like that. And the question is, what's the sort of underlying scientific

01:52.560 --> 01:57.840
 basis for those kinds of things? And the thing that I was at first very surprised by, because

01:57.840 --> 02:02.160
 I've been doing physics and particle physics, some fancy mathematical physics and so on.

02:02.160 --> 02:06.320
 And it's like, I know all this fancy stuff, I should be able to solve this sort of basic

02:06.320 --> 02:13.920
 science question. And I couldn't, this was like early, maybe 1980 ish timeframe. And it's like,

02:13.920 --> 02:19.280
 okay, what can one do to understand the sort of basic secret that nature seems to have?

02:19.280 --> 02:22.960
 Because it seems like nature, you look around in the natural world, it's full of incredibly

02:22.960 --> 02:28.640
 complicated forms. You look at sort of most engineered kinds of things, for instance,

02:28.640 --> 02:34.080
 they tend to be, you know, we've got sort of circles and lines and things like this.

02:34.080 --> 02:38.640
 And the question is, what secret does nature have that lets it make all this complexity

02:38.640 --> 02:42.960
 that we in doing engineering, for example, don't naturally seem to have?

02:42.960 --> 02:46.800
 And so that was the kind of the thing that I got interested in. And then the question was,

02:46.800 --> 02:51.120
 you know, could I understand that with things like mathematical physics? Well, it didn't work

02:51.120 --> 02:56.640
 very well. So then I got to thinking about, okay, is there some other way to try to understand this?

02:56.640 --> 03:00.160
 And then the question was, if you're going to look at some system in nature,

03:00.160 --> 03:03.760
 how do you make a model for that system, for what that system does? So, you know,

03:03.760 --> 03:08.800
 a model is some abstract representation of the system, some formal representation system.

03:08.800 --> 03:15.120
 What is the raw material that you can make that model out of? And so what I realized was,

03:15.120 --> 03:20.480
 well, actually, programs are a really good source of raw material for making models of things.

03:20.480 --> 03:26.480
 And, you know, in terms of my personal history, to me, that seemed really obvious. And the reason

03:26.480 --> 03:30.960
 it seemed really obvious is because I just spent several years building this big piece of software

03:30.960 --> 03:35.600
 that was sort of a predecessor to Mathematica and Morphan Language, then called SMP, Symbolic

03:35.600 --> 03:41.600
 Manipulation Program, which was something that had this idea of starting from just these

03:41.600 --> 03:46.560
 computational primitives and building up everything one had to build up. And so kind of the notion of,

03:46.560 --> 03:50.480
 well, let's just try and make models by starting from computational primitives and seeing what we

03:50.480 --> 03:56.800
 can build up, that seemed like a totally obvious thing to do. In retrospect, it might not have been

03:56.800 --> 04:00.880
 externally quite so obvious, but it was obvious to me at the time, given the path that I happened

04:00.880 --> 04:06.000
 to have been on. So, you know, so that got me into this question of, let's use programs

04:06.000 --> 04:11.040
 to model what happens in nature. And the question then is, well, what kind of programs?

04:11.040 --> 04:15.120
 And, you know, we're used to programs that you write for some particular purpose, and it's a

04:15.120 --> 04:20.400
 big, long piece of code, and it does some specific thing. But what I got interested in was, okay,

04:20.400 --> 04:24.640
 if you just go out into the sort of computational universe of possible programs, you say,

04:25.280 --> 04:30.720
 take the simplest program you can imagine, what does it do? And so I started studying these things

04:30.720 --> 04:34.720
 called cellular automata. Actually, I didn't know at first they were called cellular automata,

04:34.720 --> 04:39.600
 but I found that out subsequently. But it's just a line of cells, you know, each one is black or

04:39.600 --> 04:44.800
 white, and it's just some rule that says the color of the cell is determined by the color that it had

04:44.800 --> 04:49.600
 on the previous step and its two neighbors on the previous step. And I had initially thought,

04:50.480 --> 04:55.280
 that's, you know, sufficiently simple setup is not going to do anything interesting. It's always

04:55.280 --> 05:00.720
 going to be simple, no complexity, simple rule, simple behavior. Okay, but then I actually ran

05:00.720 --> 05:05.280
 the computer experiment, which was pretty easy to do. I mean, it probably took a few hours

05:05.280 --> 05:12.400
 originally. And the results were not what I'd expected at all. Now, needless to say,

05:12.400 --> 05:16.800
 in the way that science actually works, the results that I got had a lot of unexpected

05:16.800 --> 05:21.040
 things which I thought were really interesting, but the really strongest results, which was

05:21.040 --> 05:24.960
 already right there in the printouts I made, I didn't really understand for a couple more years.

05:25.520 --> 05:31.200
 So it was not, you know, the compressed version of the story is you run the experiment and you

05:31.200 --> 05:36.640
 immediately see what's going on, but I wasn't smart enough to do that, so to speak. But the

05:36.640 --> 05:43.520
 big thing is, even with very simple rules of that type, sort of the minimal, tiniest program,

05:43.520 --> 05:49.520
 sort of the one line program or something, it's possible to get very complicated behavior. My

05:49.520 --> 05:54.000
 favorite example is this thing called Rule 30, which is a particular cellular automaton rule.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.240
 You just started off from one black cell and it makes this really complicated pattern. And so that

06:00.240 --> 06:07.600
 for me was sort of a critical discovery that then kind of said, playing back onto, you know,

06:07.600 --> 06:12.320
 how does nature make complexity, I sort of realized that might be how it does it.

06:12.320 --> 06:16.400
 That might be kind of the secret that it's using is that in this kind of computational

06:16.400 --> 06:20.960
 universe of possible programs, it's actually pretty easy to get programs where even though

06:20.960 --> 06:24.720
 the program is simple, the behavior when you run the program is not simple at all.

06:24.720 --> 06:33.120
 And so for me, that was the kind of the story of kind of how that was sort of the indication that

06:33.120 --> 06:38.960
 one had got an idea of what the sort of secret that nature uses to make complexity and how

06:38.960 --> 06:44.240
 complexity can be made in other places. Now, if you say, what is complexity? You know,

06:46.080 --> 06:52.560
 complexity is it's not easy to tell what's going on. That's the informal version of what is

06:52.560 --> 06:57.360
 complexity, but there is something going on, but there's a rule to know what, right? Well, no,

06:57.360 --> 07:04.160
 the rules can generate just randomness, right? Well, that's not obvious. In other words,

07:04.880 --> 07:09.520
 it's not obvious at all. And it wasn't what I expected. It's not what people's intuition

07:09.520 --> 07:14.800
 had been and has been for, you know, for a long time. That is one might think you have a rule.

07:15.440 --> 07:20.960
 You can tell there's a rule behind it. I mean, it's just like, you know, the early, you know,

07:20.960 --> 07:26.720
 robots in science fiction movies, right? You can tell it's a robot cause it does simple things,

07:27.280 --> 07:31.840
 right? It turns out that isn't actually the right story, but it's not obvious that isn't the right

07:31.840 --> 07:37.680
 story because people assume simple rules, simple behavior. And that the sort of the key discovery

07:37.680 --> 07:43.360
 about the computational universe is that isn't true. And that discovery goes very deep and

07:43.360 --> 07:48.960
 relates to all kinds of things that I've spent years and years studying. But, you know, that in

07:48.960 --> 07:54.240
 the end, the sort of the, the what is complexity is, well, you can't easily tell what it's going

07:54.240 --> 08:00.080
 to do. You could just run the rule and see what happens, but you can't just say, oh, you know,

08:00.080 --> 08:04.960
 show me the rule. Great. And now I know what's going to happen. And, you know, the key phenomenon

08:04.960 --> 08:11.120
 around that is this thing I call computational irreducibility. This fact that in something like

08:11.120 --> 08:16.240
 rule 30, you might say, well, what's it going to do after a million steps? Well, you can run it

08:16.240 --> 08:21.520
 for a million steps and just do what it does to find out, but you can't compress that. You can't

08:21.520 --> 08:25.920
 reduce that and say, I'm going to be able to jump ahead and say, this is what it's going to do after

08:25.920 --> 08:29.040
 a million steps, but I don't have to go through anything like that computational effort.

08:29.040 --> 08:33.200
 CB. By the way, has anybody succeeded at that? Do you have to challenge a competition

08:34.080 --> 08:37.040
 for predicting the middle column of rule 30? Anybody?

08:37.040 --> 08:41.600
 MG. A number of people have sent things in and sort of people are picking away at it,

08:41.600 --> 08:50.400
 but it's hard. I mean, I've been actually even proving that the center column of rule 30 doesn't

08:50.400 --> 08:54.240
 repeat. That's something I think might be doable. Okay?

08:54.240 --> 08:55.520
 CB. Mathematically proving.

08:55.520 --> 09:00.880
 MG. Yes. And so that's analogous to a similar kind of thing as like the digits of pi,

09:00.880 --> 09:06.000
 which are also generated in this very deterministic way. And so a question is how random are the

09:06.000 --> 09:11.760
 digits of pi? For example, first of all, do the digits of pi ever repeat? We know they don't,

09:11.760 --> 09:17.280
 because it was proved in the 1800s that pi is not a rational number. So that means only rational

09:17.280 --> 09:21.360
 numbers have digit sequences that repeat. So we know the digits of pi don't repeat.

09:21.360 --> 09:27.200
 So now the question is, does 0, 1, 2, 3 or whatever, do all the digits base 10 or base 2 or

09:27.200 --> 09:33.040
 however you work it out, do they all occur with equal frequency? Nobody knows. That's far away

09:33.040 --> 09:41.280
 from what can be understood mathematically at this point. But I'm even looking for step one,

09:41.280 --> 09:46.800
 which is prove that the center column doesn't repeat and then prove other things about it,

09:46.800 --> 09:52.480
 like equidistribution of equal numbers of zeros and ones. And those are things which I kind of

09:52.480 --> 09:59.120
 set up this little prize thing because I thought those were not too out of range. Those are things

09:59.120 --> 10:06.560
 which are within a modest amount of time, it's conceivable that those could be done. They're not

10:06.560 --> 10:11.440
 far away from what current mathematics might allow. They'll require a bunch of cleverness

10:11.440 --> 10:15.680
 and hopefully some interesting new ideas that will be useful other places.

10:16.400 --> 10:23.360
 But you started in 1980 with this idea before I think you realized this idea of programs.

10:23.360 --> 10:29.680
 You thought that there might be some kind of a thermodynamic randomness and then complexity

10:29.680 --> 10:37.840
 comes from a clever filter that you kind of like, I don't know, spaghetti or something. You filter

10:37.840 --> 10:43.200
 the randomness and outcomes complexity, which is an interesting intuition. How do we know that's

10:43.200 --> 10:50.560
 not actually what's happening? So just because you were then able to develop, look, you don't need

10:50.560 --> 10:56.640
 this like incredible randomness. You can just have very simple, predictable initial conditions

10:56.640 --> 11:02.720
 and predictable rules. And then from that emerged complexity, still there might be some systems

11:02.720 --> 11:11.120
 where it's filtering randomness on the inputs. Well, the point is when you have quotes randomness

11:11.120 --> 11:15.120
 in the input, that means there's all kinds of information in the input. And in a sense,

11:15.120 --> 11:21.280
 what you get out will be maybe just something close to what you put in. Like people are very

11:21.280 --> 11:25.120
 in dynamical systems theory, sort of big area mathematics that developed

11:25.840 --> 11:31.520
 from the early 1900s and really got big in the 1980s. An example of what people study

11:31.520 --> 11:37.760
 there a lot and it's popular version is chaos theory. An example of what people study a lot

11:37.760 --> 11:44.160
 is the shift map, which is basically taking 2x mod one to the fractional part of 2x,

11:44.160 --> 11:49.840
 which is basically just taking digits in binary and shifting them to the left. So at every step,

11:49.840 --> 11:54.880
 you get to see if you say, how big is this number that I got out? Well, the most important digit in

11:54.880 --> 12:00.560
 that number is whatever ended up at the left hand end. But now if you start off from an arbitrary

12:00.560 --> 12:06.400
 random number, which is quotes randomly chosen, so all its digits are random, then when you run

12:06.400 --> 12:12.480
 that sort of chaos theory shift map, all that you get out is just whatever you put in. You just get

12:12.480 --> 12:18.080
 to see what you... It's not obvious that you would excavate all of those digits. And if you're,

12:18.080 --> 12:22.400
 for example, making a theory, I don't know, fluid mechanics, for example, if there was that

12:22.400 --> 12:27.600
 phenomenon in fluid mechanics, then the equations of fluid mechanics can't be right. Because what

12:27.600 --> 12:33.600
 that would be saying is the equations that it matters to the fluid, what happens in the fluid

12:33.600 --> 12:40.080
 at the level of the millionth digit of the initial conditions, which is far below the point at which

12:40.080 --> 12:44.560
 you're hitting sizes of molecules and things like that. So it's kind of almost explaining

12:45.280 --> 12:50.080
 if that phenomenon is an important thing, it's kind of telling you that fluid dynamics,

12:50.080 --> 12:54.400
 which describes fluids as continuous media and so on, isn't really right.

12:54.400 --> 13:01.440
 But so this idea that... It's a tricky thing because as soon as you put randomness in,

13:01.440 --> 13:07.360
 you have to know how much of what's coming out is what you put in versus how much is actually

13:07.360 --> 13:11.280
 something that's being generated. And what's really nice about these systems where you just

13:11.280 --> 13:17.600
 have very simple initial conditions and where you get random stuff out or seemingly random stuff out

13:17.600 --> 13:21.920
 is you don't have that issue. You don't have to argue about, was there something complicated put

13:21.920 --> 13:26.800
 in? Because it's plainly obvious there wasn't. Now, as a practical matter in doing experiments,

13:26.800 --> 13:34.320
 the big thing is if the thing you see is complex and reproducible, then it didn't come from just

13:34.320 --> 13:39.120
 filtering some, quotes, randomness from the outside world. It has to be something that is

13:39.120 --> 13:45.760
 intrinsically made because it wouldn't otherwise be... It could be the case that you set things up

13:45.760 --> 13:51.440
 and it's always the same each time and you say, well, it's kind of the same, but it's not random

13:51.440 --> 13:57.040
 each time because it's kind of the definition of it being random is it was kind of picked at random

13:57.040 --> 14:03.040
 each time, so to speak. So is it possible to for sure know that our universe does not at the

14:03.040 --> 14:10.400
 fundamental level have randomness? Is it possible to conclusively say there's no randomness at the

14:10.400 --> 14:16.240
 bottom? Well, it's an interesting question. I mean, you know, science, natural science is an

14:16.240 --> 14:21.520
 inductive business, right? You observe a bunch of things and you say, can we fit these together?

14:21.520 --> 14:27.680
 What is our hypothesis for what's going on? The thing that I think I can say fairly definitively

14:27.680 --> 14:34.480
 is at this point, we understand enough about fundamental physics that if there was sort of

14:34.480 --> 14:41.120
 an extra dice being thrown, it's something that doesn't need to be there. We can get what we see

14:41.120 --> 14:49.360
 without that. Now, could you add that in as an extra little featureoid without breaking the

14:49.360 --> 14:56.000
 universe? Probably, but in fact, almost certainly yes. But is it necessary for understanding the

14:56.000 --> 15:03.360
 universe? No. And I think actually from a more fundamental point of view, I think I might be

15:03.360 --> 15:07.680
 able to argue. So one of the things that I've been interested in and been pretty surprised that I've

15:07.680 --> 15:13.520
 had anything sentient to say about is the question of why does the universe exist? I didn't think

15:13.520 --> 15:18.400
 that was a question that I would, you know, I thought that was a far out there metaphysical

15:18.400 --> 15:23.600
 kind of thing. Even the philosophers have stayed away from that question for the most part.

15:23.600 --> 15:30.880
 It's such a kind of difficult to address question. But I actually think to my great surprise that

15:30.880 --> 15:36.320
 from our physics project and so on, that it is possible to actually address that question and

15:36.320 --> 15:40.960
 explain why the universe exists. And I kind of have a suspicion. I've not thought it through.

15:40.960 --> 15:46.800
 I kind of have a suspicion that that explanation will eventually show you that in no meaningful

15:46.800 --> 15:52.880
 sense can there be randomness underneath the universe. That is that if there is, it's something

15:52.880 --> 15:59.600
 that is necessarily irrelevant to our perception of the universe. That is that it could be there,

15:59.600 --> 16:04.400
 but doesn't matter because in a sense, we've already, you know, whatever it would do,

16:04.400 --> 16:09.200
 whatever extra thing it would add is not relevant to our perception of what's going on.

16:09.200 --> 16:17.680
 So why does the universe exist? How does the relevance of randomness connect to the big

16:17.680 --> 16:23.040
 why question of the universe? So, OK, so I mean, why does the universe exist? Well, let's see.

16:23.040 --> 16:28.800
 And is this the only universe we got? It's the only one that about that I'm pretty sure.

16:28.800 --> 16:35.920
 So now maybe which one which of these topics is better to enter first? Why does the universe exist

16:35.920 --> 16:41.600
 and why you think it's the only one that exists? Well, I think they're very closely related. OK.

16:41.600 --> 16:47.040
 OK. So, I mean, the first thing, let's see, I mean, this why does the universe exist question

16:47.040 --> 16:52.080
 is built on top of all these things that we've been figuring out about fundamental physics,

16:52.640 --> 16:55.520
 because if you want to know why the universe exists, you kind of have to know what the

16:55.520 --> 17:02.320
 universe is made of. And I think the well, let me let me describe a little bit about

17:02.880 --> 17:07.040
 the why does the universe exist question. So the main issue is let's say you have a model

17:07.040 --> 17:12.160
 for the universe and you say I've got this this program or something and you run it and you make

17:12.160 --> 17:17.440
 the universe. Now you say, well, how do you actually why is that program actually running?

17:17.440 --> 17:21.360
 And people say you've got this program that makes the universe. What computer is it running on?

17:21.920 --> 17:27.120
 Right. What what does it mean? What actualizes something? You know, two plus two equals four.

17:27.120 --> 17:31.280
 But that's different from saying this to a pile of two rocks, another pile of two rocks, and so

17:31.280 --> 17:37.040
 many moves them together and makes four, so to speak. And so what is it that kind of turns it

17:37.040 --> 17:43.440
 from being just this formal thing to being something that is actualized? OK, so there we

17:43.440 --> 17:47.920
 have to start thinking about, well, well, what do we actually know about what's going on in the

17:47.920 --> 17:53.360
 universe? Well, we are observers of this universe. But confusingly enough, we're part of this

17:53.360 --> 17:59.440
 universe. So in a sense, we what what what if we say what do we what do we know about what's

17:59.440 --> 18:04.400
 going on in the universe? Well, what we know is what sort of our consciousness records about

18:04.400 --> 18:09.520
 what's going on in the universe. And consciousness is part of the fabric of the universe. So we're

18:09.520 --> 18:15.120
 in it. Yes, we're in it. And maybe I should maybe I should start off by saying something about

18:15.120 --> 18:23.040
 the consciousness story, because that's some. Maybe we should begin even before that at the

18:23.040 --> 18:29.760
 very base layer of the Wolfram physics project. Maybe you can give a broad overview once again

18:29.760 --> 18:36.160
 really quick about this hypergraph model. Yes. And also, what is it a year and a half ago since

18:36.160 --> 18:42.240
 you've brought this project to the world? What is the status update where what are all the beautiful

18:42.240 --> 18:48.240
 ideas you have come across? What are the interesting things you can mention? It's I mean,

18:48.240 --> 18:53.680
 it's a it's a frigging Cambrian explosion. I mean, it's it's crazy. I mean, there are all these

18:53.680 --> 18:58.960
 things which I've kind of wondered about for years. And suddenly, there's actually a way to

18:58.960 --> 19:04.240
 think about them. And I really did not see. I mean, the real strength of what's happened,

19:04.240 --> 19:09.120
 I absolutely did not see coming. And the real strength of it is we've got this model for physics,

19:09.120 --> 19:13.680
 but it turns out it's a foundational kind of model. That's a different kind of computation

19:13.680 --> 19:20.720
 like model that I'm kind of calling the sort of multi computational model. And that that kind of

19:20.720 --> 19:26.640
 model is applicable not only to physics, but also to lots of other kinds of things. And one reason

19:26.640 --> 19:31.920
 that's extremely powerful is because physics has been very successful. So we know a lot based on

19:31.920 --> 19:37.040
 what we figured out in physics. And if we know that the same model governs physics and governs,

19:37.040 --> 19:42.080
 I don't know, economics, linguistics, immunology, whatever, we know that the same kind of model

19:42.080 --> 19:47.360
 governs those things. We can start using things that we've successfully discovered in physics

19:47.360 --> 19:52.640
 and applying those intuitions in all these other areas. And that's that's pretty exciting and very

19:52.640 --> 19:59.040
 and very surprising to me. And in fact, it's kind of like in the original story of sort of you go

19:59.040 --> 20:03.920
 and you explain why is there complexity in the natural world, then you realize, well, there's all

20:03.920 --> 20:08.320
 this complexity, there's all this computational irreducibility. You know, there's a lot we can't

20:08.320 --> 20:12.560
 know about what's going to happen. It's kind of kind of very confusing thing for people who say,

20:12.560 --> 20:16.080
 you know, science has nailed everything down. We're going to, you know, based on science,

20:16.080 --> 20:20.080
 we can know everything. Well, actually, there's this computational irreducibility thing

20:20.080 --> 20:25.040
 right in the middle of that, thrown up by science, so to speak. And then the question is, well,

20:25.040 --> 20:29.440
 given computational irreducibility, how can we actually figure out anything about what happens

20:29.440 --> 20:33.920
 in the world? Why aren't we why are we able to predict anything? Why are we able to operate in

20:33.920 --> 20:39.200
 the world? And the answer is that we sort of live in these slices of computational reusability

20:39.200 --> 20:45.440
 that exist in this kind of ocean of computational irreducibility. And it turns out that seems that

20:45.440 --> 20:50.160
 it's a very fundamental feature of the kind of model that seems to operate in physics,

20:50.800 --> 20:55.760
 and perhaps in a lot of these other areas, that there are these particular slices of

20:55.760 --> 21:02.240
 computational reusability that are relevant to us. And those are the things that both allow us to

21:02.240 --> 21:06.880
 operate in the world, and not just have everything be completely unpredictable. But there are also

21:06.880 --> 21:12.960
 things that potentially give us what amount to sort of physics like laws in all these other areas.

21:12.960 --> 21:17.440
 So that's, that's been sort of an exciting thing. But, but I would say that in general, for our

21:17.440 --> 21:23.360
 project, it's been going spectacularly well. I mean, you know, I, it's very, honestly, it wasn't

21:23.360 --> 21:27.840
 something I expected to happen in my lifetime. I mean, it's, you know, it's something where,

21:28.400 --> 21:34.080
 where it's, it's an in fact, one of the things about it, some of the things that we've discovered,

21:34.080 --> 21:40.240
 are things where I was pretty sure that wasn't how things worked. And turns out I'm wrong. And,

21:40.240 --> 21:45.520
 you know, in a major area in metamathematics, I've been realizing that I something I've long

21:45.520 --> 21:51.760
 believed we can talk about it later that that that just just really isn't right. But But I think that

21:53.040 --> 21:58.560
 the the thing that so so what's happened with the physics project? I mean, you know, it's a

21:59.440 --> 22:02.640
 can explain a little bit about how the how the model works. But basically,

22:02.640 --> 22:08.880
 we can maybe ask you the following question. So it's easy through words describe how cellular

22:08.880 --> 22:16.480
 automata works, you've you've explained this. And it's the fundamental mechanism by which you in

22:16.480 --> 22:21.920
 your book, and you kind of science explored the idea of complexity and how to do science in this

22:21.920 --> 22:30.640
 world of island reducible islands and irreducible general irreducibility. Okay, so how does the model

22:30.640 --> 22:35.840
 of hypergraphs differ from cellular automata? And how does the idea of multi computation

22:35.840 --> 22:42.160
 differ? Like, maybe that's a way to describe it. We're we're, you know, right. This is a, you know,

22:42.160 --> 22:47.040
 my life is like all of our lives, something of a story of computational irreducibility. Yes.

22:47.040 --> 22:52.240
 And, you know, it's been going for a few years now. So it's always a challenge to kind of find

22:52.240 --> 22:57.200
 these appropriate pockets of reducibility. But let me see what I can do. So, so I mean,

22:57.200 --> 23:03.760
 first of all, let's let's talk about physics, first of all. And, you know, a key observation,

23:03.760 --> 23:09.680
 that one of the starting point of our physics project is things about what is space? What is

23:09.680 --> 23:15.120
 the universe made of? And, you know, ever since Euclid, people just sort of say space is just this

23:15.120 --> 23:19.600
 thing where you can put things at any position you want. And they're just points. And they're just

23:19.600 --> 23:24.560
 geometrical things that you can just arbitrarily put at different different coordinate positions.

23:25.040 --> 23:30.400
 So the first thing in our physics project is the idea that space is made of something, just like

23:30.400 --> 23:36.240
 just like water is made of molecules, space is made of kind of atoms of space. And the only thing we

23:36.240 --> 23:40.640
 can say about these atoms of space is they have some identity. There's a there's a there is it's

23:40.640 --> 23:45.120
 this atom as opposed to this atom. And, you know, you could give them a few a computer person, you

23:45.120 --> 23:54.960
 give them UUIDs or something. And that's all there is to say about them, so to speak. And then all we

23:54.960 --> 24:02.480
 know about these atoms of space is how they relate to each other. So we say, these three atoms of

24:02.480 --> 24:08.400
 space are associated with each other in some relation. So you can think about that as you know,

24:08.400 --> 24:13.520
 what atom of space is friends with what other atom of space, you can build this essentially friend

24:13.520 --> 24:18.800
 network of the atoms of space. And the sort of starting point of our physics project is that's

24:18.800 --> 24:24.800
 what our universe is, it's a giant friend network of the atoms of space. And so how can that

24:24.800 --> 24:31.360
 possibly represent our universe? Well, it's like in something like water, you know, their molecules

24:31.360 --> 24:37.120
 bouncing around, but on a large scale that, you know, that produces fluid flow, and we have fluid

24:37.120 --> 24:42.160
 vortices, and we have all of these phenomena that are sort of the emergent phenomena from that

24:42.160 --> 24:47.360
 underlying kind of collection of molecules bouncing around. And by the way, it's important that that

24:47.360 --> 24:51.760
 collection of molecules bouncing around have this phenomenon of computational irreducibility,

24:51.760 --> 24:54.960
 that's actually what leads to the second law of thermodynamics among other things.

24:55.520 --> 25:00.960
 And that leads to the sort of randomness of the underlying behavior, which is what gives you

25:00.960 --> 25:07.840
 something which on a large scale seems like it's a smooth continuous type of thing. And so okay,

25:07.840 --> 25:13.680
 so first thing is space is made of something, it's made of all these atoms of space connected

25:13.680 --> 25:20.640
 together in this network. And then everything that we experience is sort of features of that

25:20.640 --> 25:24.400
 structure of space. So, you know, when we have an electron or something or a photon,

25:24.400 --> 25:29.360
 it's some kind of tangle in the structure of space, much like kind of a vortex in a fluid

25:29.360 --> 25:34.160
 would be just this thing that is, you know, it can actually, the vortex can move around,

25:34.160 --> 25:38.480
 it can involve different molecules in the fluid, but the vortex still stays there.

25:38.480 --> 25:42.880
 And if you zoom out enough, the vortex looks like an atom itself, like a basic

25:42.880 --> 25:49.680
 element. So there's the levels of abstraction. If you squint and kind of blur things out,

25:49.680 --> 25:55.760
 it looks like at every level of abstraction, you can define what is a basic individual entity.

25:55.760 --> 26:01.040
 Yes. But, you know, in this model, there's a bottom level, you know, there's an elementary

26:01.040 --> 26:05.680
 length, maybe 10 to the minus 100 meters, let's say, which is really small, you know,

26:05.680 --> 26:12.000
 proton is 10 to the minus 15 meters, the smallest we've ever been able to sort of see with a particle

26:12.000 --> 26:17.760
 accelerator is around 10 to the minus 21 meters. So, you know, if we don't know precisely what

26:17.760 --> 26:21.520
 the correct scale is, but it's perhaps over the order of 10 to the minus 100 meters, so it's

26:21.520 --> 26:26.880
 pretty small. But that's the end, that's what things are made of.

26:26.880 --> 26:32.400
 What's your intuition where the 10 to the minus 100 comes from? What's your intuition about this

26:32.400 --> 26:33.360
 scale?

26:33.360 --> 26:37.280
 Well, okay, so there's a calculation, which I consider to be somewhat rickety,

26:37.280 --> 26:42.800
 okay, which has to do with comparing, so there are various fundamental constants,

26:42.800 --> 26:46.880
 there's a speed of light, the speed of light, once you know the elementary time,

26:46.880 --> 26:51.440
 the speed of light tells you the conversion from the elementary time to the elementary length.

26:52.160 --> 26:56.960
 Then there's the question of how do you convert to the elementary energy? And how do you convert

26:56.960 --> 27:00.960
 to between other things? And the various constants we know, we know the speed of light,

27:00.960 --> 27:05.600
 we know the gravitational constant, we know Planck's constant and quantum mechanics,

27:05.600 --> 27:09.920
 those are the three important ones. And we actually know some other things, we know things

27:09.920 --> 27:15.120
 like the size of the universe, the Hubble constant, things like that. And essentially,

27:15.120 --> 27:21.280
 this calculation of the elementary length comes from looking at the combination of those.

27:21.280 --> 27:26.160
 Okay, so the most obvious thing, people have assumed that quantum gravity happens at this

27:26.160 --> 27:32.080
 thing, the Planck scale, 10 to the minus 34 meters, which is the combination of Planck's

27:32.080 --> 27:36.080
 constant and the gravitational constant, the speed of light, that gives you that kind of length.

27:37.280 --> 27:42.960
 Turns out in our model, there is an additional parameter, which is essentially the number of

27:42.960 --> 27:47.520
 simultaneous threads of execution of the universe, which is essentially the number of sort of

27:47.520 --> 27:52.960
 independent quantum processes that are going on. And that number, let's see if I remember that

27:52.960 --> 28:00.560
 number, that number is 10 to the 170, I think, and so it's a big number. But that number then

28:00.560 --> 28:07.920
 connects, sort of modifies what you might think from all these Planck units to give you the things

28:07.920 --> 28:12.560
 we're giving. And there's been sort of a mystery actually in the more technical physics thing,

28:12.560 --> 28:19.440
 that the Planck mass, the Planck energy, Planck energy is actually surprisingly big. The Planck

28:19.440 --> 28:24.000
 length is tiny, 10 to the minus 34 meters, you know, Planck time, 10 to the minus 43 meters,

28:24.000 --> 28:32.080
 I think, seconds, I think. But the Planck energy is like the energy of a lightning strike,

28:32.080 --> 28:38.240
 okay, which is pretty weird. In our models, the actual elementary energy is that divided by the

28:38.240 --> 28:43.040
 number of sort of simultaneous quantum threads, and it ends up being really small too. And that

28:43.040 --> 28:49.040
 sort of explains that mystery that's been around for a while about how Planck units work. But

28:50.000 --> 28:54.800
 whether that precise estimate is right, we don't know yet. I mean, that's one of the things that's

28:54.800 --> 29:00.400
 sort of been a thing we've been pretty interested in is how do you see through, you know, how do you

29:00.400 --> 29:05.920
 make a gravitational microscope that can kind of see through to the atoms of space? You know,

29:05.920 --> 29:10.480
 how do you get in fluid flow, for example, if you go to hypersonic flow or something, you know,

29:10.480 --> 29:15.040
 you've got a Mach 20, you know, space plane or something, it really matters that there are

29:15.040 --> 29:20.560
 individual molecules hitting the space plane, not a continuous fluid. The question is, what is the

29:22.640 --> 29:30.480
 analog of hypersonic flow for things about the structure of spacetime? And it looks like a

29:30.480 --> 29:38.880
 rapidly rotating black hole, right, at the sort of critical rotation rate, it looks as if that's

29:38.880 --> 29:45.920
 a case where essentially the structure of spacetime is just about to fall apart, and you

29:45.920 --> 29:52.640
 may be able to kind of see the evidence of sort of discrete elements, you know, you may be able

29:52.640 --> 29:57.280
 to kind of see there the sort of gravitational microscope of actually seeing these discrete

29:57.280 --> 30:03.520
 elements of space. And there may be some effect in, for example, gravitational waves produced by

30:03.520 --> 30:08.480
 rapidly rotating black hole that in which one could actually see some phenomenon where one

30:08.480 --> 30:14.640
 can say, yes, these don't come out the way one would expect based on having a continuous structure

30:14.640 --> 30:19.120
 of spacetime, that is something where you can kind of see through to the discrete structure.

30:19.840 --> 30:25.280
 We don't know that yet. So can you maybe elaborate a little bit deeper how a microscope that can see

30:25.280 --> 30:36.320
 the 10 to the minus 100, how rotating black holes and presumably the detailed accurate

30:36.320 --> 30:41.920
 detection of gravitational waves from such black holes can reveal the discreteness of space?

30:42.800 --> 30:47.360
 Okay, first thing is, what is a black hole? Actually, we need to go a little bit further in

30:47.360 --> 30:50.560
 the story of what spacetime is, because I explained a little bit about what space is,

30:50.560 --> 30:55.600
 but I didn't talk about what time is. And that's sort of important in understanding spacetime,

30:55.600 --> 30:59.920
 so to speak. And your sense is both space and time in the story are discrete.

30:59.920 --> 31:05.360
 Absolutely. Absolutely. But it's a complicated story. And needless to say.

31:05.360 --> 31:11.520
 Well, it's simple at the bottom. It's very simple at the bottom. In the end,

31:11.520 --> 31:18.320
 it's simple but deeply abstract. And something that is simple in conception,

31:18.320 --> 31:24.480
 but kind of wrapping one's head around what's going on is pretty hard. So first of all,

31:24.480 --> 31:29.040
 we have this. So I've described these kind of atoms of space and their connections.

31:29.040 --> 31:34.000
 You can think about these things as a hypergraph. A graph is just you connect nodes to nodes,

31:34.000 --> 31:40.800
 but a hypergraph you can have not just individual friends to friends, but you can have these

31:40.800 --> 31:47.200
 triplets of friends or whatever else. And so we're just saying that's just the relations

31:47.200 --> 31:52.960
 between atoms of space are the hyperedges of the hypergraph. And so we got some big collection of

31:52.960 --> 31:59.440
 these atoms of space, maybe 10 to the 400 or something in our universe. And that's the structure

31:59.440 --> 32:07.120
 of space. And every feature of what we experience in the world is a feature of that hypergraph,

32:07.120 --> 32:12.240
 that spatial hypergraph. So then the question is, well, what does that spatial hypergraph do?

32:12.240 --> 32:18.800
 Well, the idea is that there are rules that update that spatial hypergraph. And in a cellular

32:18.800 --> 32:23.760
 automaton, you've just got this line of cells and you just say at every step, at every time step,

32:23.760 --> 32:29.120
 you've got fixed time steps, fixed array of cells. At every step, every cell gets updated

32:29.120 --> 32:36.240
 according to a certain rule. And that's the way it works. Now in this hypergraph, it's sort of

32:36.240 --> 32:40.800
 vaguely the same kind of thing. We say every time you see a little piece of hypergraph that looks

32:40.800 --> 32:47.120
 like this, update it to one that looks like this. So just keep rewriting this hypergraph. Every time

32:47.120 --> 32:51.920
 you see something that looks like that, anywhere in the universe, it gets rewritten. Now, one thing

32:51.920 --> 32:56.640
 that's tricky about that, which we'll come to, is this multi computational idea, which has to do

32:56.640 --> 33:02.560
 with you're not saying in some kind of lockstep way, do this one, then this one, then this one.

33:02.560 --> 33:07.920
 It's just whenever you see one you can do, you can go ahead and do it. And that leads one not to

33:07.920 --> 33:13.440
 have a single thread of time in the universe. Because if you knew which one to do, you just say,

33:13.440 --> 33:17.360
 okay, we do this one, then we do this one, then we do this one. But if you say, just do whichever

33:17.360 --> 33:21.520
 one you feel like, you end up with these multiple threads of time, these kind of multiple histories

33:21.520 --> 33:26.000
 of the universe, depending on which order you happen to do the things you could do in.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.880
 So it's fundamentally asynchronous and parallel.

33:28.880 --> 33:30.240
 Yes. Yes.

33:30.240 --> 33:35.200
 Which is very uncomfortable for the human brain that seeks for things to be sequential.

33:35.200 --> 33:35.680
 Yes.

33:35.680 --> 33:36.880
 And synchronous.

33:36.880 --> 33:41.920
 Right. Well, I think that this is part of the story of consciousness,

33:42.480 --> 33:48.400
 is I think the key aspect of consciousness that is important for sort of parsing the universe,

33:48.400 --> 33:53.600
 is this point that we have a single thread of experience. We have a memory of what happened

33:53.600 --> 33:57.600
 in the past. We can say something, predict something about the future, but there's a single

33:57.600 --> 34:00.880
 thread of experience. And it's not obvious it should work that way. I mean, we've got 100

34:00.880 --> 34:04.480
 billion neurons in our brains and they're all firing at all kinds of different ways.

34:04.480 --> 34:12.880
 But yet, our experience is that there is the single thread of time that goes along. And I

34:12.880 --> 34:18.000
 think that one of the things I've kind of realized with a lot more clarity in the last year is the

34:18.000 --> 34:24.240
 fact that the fact that we conclude that the universe has the laws it has is a consequence

34:24.240 --> 34:31.120
 of the fact that we have consciousness the way we have consciousness. And so, just to go on with

34:31.120 --> 34:36.800
 kind of the basic setup, so we've got this spatial hypergraph, it's got all these atoms of space,

34:38.160 --> 34:41.200
 they're getting these little clumps of atoms of space, they're getting turned into other clumps

34:41.200 --> 34:45.040
 of atoms of space, and that's happening everywhere in the universe all the time. And so, one thing

34:45.040 --> 34:49.280
 that's a little bit weird is there's nothing permanent in the universe. The universe is getting

34:49.280 --> 34:53.840
 rewritten everywhere all the time. And if it wasn't getting rewritten, space wouldn't be knitted

34:53.840 --> 34:58.560
 together. That is, space would just fall apart. There wouldn't be any way in which we could say

34:58.560 --> 35:04.880
 this part of space is next to this part of space. One of the things that people were confused about

35:04.880 --> 35:11.440
 back in antiquity, the ancient Greek philosophers and so on, is how does motion work? How can it be

35:11.440 --> 35:16.800
 the case that you can take a thing that we can walk around and it's still us when we walked a

35:16.800 --> 35:23.040
 foot forward, so to speak? And in a sense, with our models, that's again a question because it's

35:23.040 --> 35:29.200
 a different set of atoms of space. When I move my hand, it's moving into a different set of atoms

35:29.200 --> 35:35.360
 of space. It's having to be recreated. The thing itself is not there. It's being continuously

35:35.360 --> 35:40.560
 recreated all the time. Now, it's a little bit like waves in an ocean, vortices in a fluid,

35:40.560 --> 35:46.080
 which again, the actual molecules that exist in those are not what define the identity of the

35:46.080 --> 35:55.280
 thing. But this idea that there can be pure motion, that it is even possible for an object

35:55.280 --> 36:00.480
 to just move around in the universe and not change, it's not self evident that such a thing

36:00.480 --> 36:06.560
 should be possible. And that is part of our perception of the universe is that we parse

36:06.560 --> 36:11.360
 those aspects of the universe where things like pure motion are possible. Now, pure motion,

36:11.360 --> 36:16.400
 even in general relativity, the theory of gravity, pure motion is a little bit of a complicated

36:16.400 --> 36:21.760
 thing. I mean, if you imagine your average teacup or something approaching a black hole,

36:21.760 --> 36:27.600
 it is deformed and distorted by the structure of space time. And to say, is it really pure motion?

36:27.600 --> 36:32.320
 Is it that same teacup that's the same shape? Well, it's a bit of a complicated story. And this

36:32.320 --> 36:38.880
 is a more extreme version of that. So anyway, the thing that's happening is we've got space,

36:38.880 --> 36:45.360
 we've got this notion of time. So time is this kind of this rewriting of the hypergraph. And one

36:45.360 --> 36:50.000
 of the things that's important about that time is this sort of computational irreducible process.

36:50.000 --> 36:56.080
 There's something, you know, time is not something where it's kind of the mathematical view of time

36:56.080 --> 37:01.440
 tends to be time is just to coordinate. We can, you know, slide a slider, turn a knob,

37:01.440 --> 37:06.800
 and we'll change the time that we've got in this equation. But in this picture of time,

37:06.800 --> 37:12.960
 that's not how it works at all. Time is this inexorable, irreducible kind of set of computations

37:12.960 --> 37:20.240
 that go on, that go from where we are now to the future. And one of the things that is, again,

37:20.240 --> 37:25.200
 something one sort of has to break out of is your average trained physicist like me says,

37:25.200 --> 37:29.200
 you know, space and time are the same kind of thing. They're related by, you know,

37:29.200 --> 37:34.160
 the Poincare group and Lorentz transformations and relativity and all these kinds of things.

37:34.160 --> 37:38.880
 And, you know, space and time, you know, there are all these kind of sort of folk stories you

37:38.880 --> 37:43.440
 can tell about why space and time are the same kind of thing. In this model, they're fundamentally

37:43.440 --> 37:49.360
 not the same kind of thing. Space is this kind of sort of connections between these atoms of space.

37:49.360 --> 37:55.040
 Time is this computational process. So the thing that the first sort of surprising thing is, well,

37:55.040 --> 38:00.160
 it turns out you get relativity anyway. And the reason that happens, there are a few bits and

38:00.160 --> 38:06.560
 pieces here which one has to understand. But the fundamental point is if you are an observer

38:06.560 --> 38:12.720
 embedded in the system that are part of this whole story of things getting updated in this way and

38:12.720 --> 38:18.160
 that, there's sort of a limit to what you can tell about what's going on. And really, in the end,

38:18.160 --> 38:24.720
 the only thing you can tell is what are the causal relationships between events. So an event in this

38:24.720 --> 38:31.200
 sort of an elementary event is a little piece of hypergraph got rewritten. And that means a few

38:31.200 --> 38:36.720
 hyper edges of the hypergraph were consumed by the event and you produce some other hyper edges.

38:36.720 --> 38:43.520
 And that's an elementary event. And so then the question is what we can tell is kind of what the

38:43.520 --> 38:48.080
 network of causal relationships between elementary events is. That's the ultimate thing,

38:48.080 --> 38:53.920
 the causal graph of the universe. And it turns out that, well, there's this property of causal

38:53.920 --> 38:59.840
 invariance that is true of a bunch of these models and I think is inevitably true for a variety of

38:59.840 --> 39:08.160
 reasons that makes it be the case that it doesn't matter kind of if you are sort of saying, well,

39:08.160 --> 39:12.160
 I've got this hypergraph and I can rewrite this piece here and this piece here and I do them all

39:12.160 --> 39:17.760
 in different orders. When you construct the causal graph for each of those orders that you choose to

39:17.760 --> 39:24.480
 do things in, you'll end up with the same causal graph. And so that's essentially why, well,

39:24.480 --> 39:31.920
 that's in the end why relativity works. It's why our perception of space and time is as having

39:31.920 --> 39:37.120
 this kind of connection that relativity says they should have. And that's kind of how that works.

39:37.760 --> 39:42.480
 I think I'm missing a little piece. If we can go there again, you said the fact that the

39:42.480 --> 39:50.400
 observer is embedded in this hypergraph, what's missing? What is the observer not able to state

39:50.400 --> 39:55.440
 about this universe of space and time? If you look from the outside, you can say,

39:55.440 --> 40:05.120
 oh, I see this particular place was updated and then this one was updated and I'm seeing which

40:05.120 --> 40:09.760
 order things were updated in. But the observer embedded in the universe doesn't know which order

40:09.760 --> 40:14.720
 things were updated in because until they've been updated, they have no idea what else happened.

40:14.720 --> 40:20.240
 So the only thing they know is the set of causal relationships. Let me give an extreme example.

40:20.240 --> 40:25.040
 Let's imagine that the universe is a Turing machine. Turing machines have just this one

40:25.040 --> 40:29.280
 update head which does something and otherwise the Turing machine just does nothing.

40:30.560 --> 40:35.680
 And the Turing machine works by having this head move around and do its updating just where the

40:35.680 --> 40:40.400
 head happens to be. The question is, could the universe be a Turing machine? Could the universe

40:40.400 --> 40:44.320
 just have a single updating head that's just zipping around all over the place? You say,

40:44.320 --> 40:49.520
 that's crazy because I'm talking to you, you seem to be updating, I'm updating,

40:49.520 --> 40:53.600
 et cetera. But the thing is, there's no way to know that because if there was just this head

40:53.600 --> 40:58.960
 moving around, it's like, okay, it updates me, but you're completely frozen at that point.

40:58.960 --> 41:02.720
 Until the head has come over and updated you, you have no idea what happened to me.

41:02.720 --> 41:07.200
 And so if you sort of unravel that argument, you realize the only thing we actually can tell

41:07.680 --> 41:13.040
 is what the network of causal relationships between the things that happened were. We don't

41:13.040 --> 41:19.280
 get to know from some sort of outside, sort of God's eye view of the thing. We don't get to know

41:19.840 --> 41:26.080
 what sort of from the outside, what happened. We only get to know sort of what the set of

41:26.080 --> 41:28.880
 relationships between the things that happened actually were.

41:28.880 --> 41:36.240
 Yeah. But if I somehow record like a trace of this, I guess it would be called multi computation.

41:36.880 --> 41:40.560
 Can't I then look back in the causal tree?

41:40.560 --> 41:41.760
 Where do you record the trace?

41:42.720 --> 41:50.080
 Some, you place throughout the universe, like throughout like a log that records in my own

41:50.080 --> 41:56.880
 pocket of, in this hypergraph. Can't I, like realizing that I'm getting an outdated picture,

41:56.880 --> 41:58.560
 can't I record?

41:58.560 --> 42:03.760
 See, the problem is, and this is where things start getting very entangled in terms of what

42:03.760 --> 42:10.080
 one understands. The problem is that any such recording device is itself part of the universe.

42:10.080 --> 42:10.580
 Yeah.

42:10.580 --> 42:15.760
 So you don't get to say, you never get to say, let's go outside the universe and go do this.

42:16.560 --> 42:22.560
 And that's why, I mean, lots of the features of this model and the way things work end up being

42:22.560 --> 42:23.600
 a result of that.

42:23.600 --> 42:30.240
 So, but what, I guess from on a human level, what is the cost you're paying? What are you missing

42:30.240 --> 42:34.960
 from not getting an updated picture all the time? Okay. I got, I understand what you're saying.

42:34.960 --> 42:35.520
 Yeah, yeah, right.

42:35.520 --> 42:41.760
 But like what, like, how does consciousness emerge from that? Like how, like, what are

42:41.760 --> 42:45.200
 the limitations of that observer? I understand you're getting a delayed picture.

42:45.200 --> 42:50.320
 Well, there's, there's a, okay. So there's, there's a bunch of limitations of the observer, I think.

42:50.320 --> 42:54.480
 Yeah. Maybe just explain something about quantum mechanics, because that maybe is a,

42:54.480 --> 42:59.680
 is an extreme version of some of these issues, which helps to kind of motivate why one should

42:59.680 --> 43:05.280
 sort of think things through a little bit more carefully. So one feature of the, of this, okay.

43:05.280 --> 43:10.960
 So in standard physics, like high school physics, you learn, you know, the equations of motion for

43:10.960 --> 43:16.800
 a ball and the, the, you know, it says you throw the ball this angle, this velocity,

43:16.800 --> 43:21.920
 things will move in this way. And there's a definite answer, right? The story, the key story

43:21.920 --> 43:25.840
 of quantum mechanics is there aren't definite answers to where does the ball go? There's kind

43:25.840 --> 43:32.080
 of this whole sort of bundle of possible paths. And all we say we know from quantum mechanics

43:32.080 --> 43:36.720
 is certain probabilities for where the ball will end up. Okay. So that's kind of the,

43:36.720 --> 43:42.080
 the core idea of quantum mechanics. So in our models, you, quantum mechanics is not some kind

43:42.080 --> 43:47.280
 of plugin add on type thing. You absolutely cannot get away from quantum mechanics because

43:47.280 --> 43:51.760
 as you think about updating this hypergraph, there isn't just one sequence of things,

43:51.760 --> 43:55.600
 one definite sequence of things that can happen. There are all these different possible update

43:55.600 --> 43:59.760
 sequences that can occur. You could do this, you know, piece of the hypergraph now, and then this

43:59.760 --> 44:05.200
 one later and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. All those different paths of history correspond to

44:05.200 --> 44:10.720
 these quantum, quantum paths and quantum mechanics, these different possible quantum histories.

44:10.720 --> 44:15.760
 And one of the things that's kind of surprising about it is they, they branch, you know, there can

44:15.760 --> 44:20.640
 be a certain state of the universe and it could do this or it could do that, but they can also

44:20.640 --> 44:25.680
 merge. There can be two states of the universe, which their next state, the next state they

44:25.680 --> 44:30.400
 produce is the same for both of them. And that process of branching and merging is kind of

44:30.400 --> 44:34.400
 critical. And the idea that there can be merging is critical and somewhat non trivial for these

44:34.400 --> 44:39.040
 hypergraphs because there's a whole graph isomorphism story and there's a whole very

44:39.040 --> 44:47.680
 elaborate set of mathematics. Yes. Among other things. Right. Yes. But so then what happens is

44:47.680 --> 44:53.360
 that what one's seeing, okay, so we've got this thing, it's branching, it's merging, et cetera,

44:53.360 --> 45:01.120
 et cetera, et cetera. Okay. So now the question is how do we perceive that? Why don't we notice

45:01.120 --> 45:06.000
 that the universe is branching and merging? Why is it the case that we just think a definite set

45:06.000 --> 45:11.520
 of things happen? Well, the answer is we are embedded in that universe and our brains are

45:11.520 --> 45:16.720
 branching and merging too. And so what quantum mechanics becomes a story of is how does a

45:16.720 --> 45:23.760
 branching brain perceive a branching universe? And the key thing is as soon as you say,

45:23.760 --> 45:28.720
 I think definite things happen in the universe, that means you are essentially conflating

45:28.720 --> 45:33.440
 lots of different parts of history. You're saying, actually, as far as I'm concerned,

45:33.440 --> 45:38.160
 because I'm convinced that definite things happen in the universe, all these parts of history must

45:38.160 --> 45:42.720
 be equivalent. Now, it's not obvious that that would be a consistent thing to do. It might be,

45:42.720 --> 45:47.200
 you say, all these parts of history are equivalent, but by golly, moments later,

45:47.200 --> 45:51.280
 that would be a completely inconsistent point of view. Everything would have gone to hell in

45:51.280 --> 45:56.000
 different ways. The fact that that doesn't happen is, well, that's a consequence of this causal

45:56.000 --> 46:01.520
 invariance thing. And the fact that that does happen a little bit is what causes little quantum

46:01.520 --> 46:08.400
 effects. And if that didn't happen at all, there wouldn't be anything that sort of is like quantum

46:08.400 --> 46:16.640
 mechanics. Quantum mechanics is kind of like in this bundle of paths. It's a little bit like what

46:16.640 --> 46:20.880
 happens in statistical mechanics and fluid mechanics, whatever, that most of the time,

46:20.880 --> 46:25.120
 you just see this continuous fluid. You just see the world just progressing in this kind of way

46:25.120 --> 46:29.440
 that's like this continuous fluid. But every so often, if you look at the exact right experiment,

46:29.440 --> 46:33.280
 you can start seeing, well, actually, it's made of these molecules where they might go that way,

46:33.280 --> 46:40.400
 or they might go this way, and that's kind of quantum effects. And so, this kind of idea of

46:41.040 --> 46:45.760
 where we're sort of embedded in the universe, this branching brain is perceiving this branching

46:45.760 --> 46:51.600
 universe, and that ends up being sort of a story of quantum mechanics. That's part of the whole

46:51.600 --> 46:56.880
 picture of what's going on. But I think, I mean, to come back to sort of what is the story of

46:56.880 --> 47:03.200
 consciousness. So, in the universe, we've got whatever it is, 10 to the 400 atoms of space,

47:03.200 --> 47:08.320
 they're all doing these complicated things. It's all a big, complicated, irreducible computation.

47:08.320 --> 47:15.600
 The question is, what do we perceive from all of that? And the answer is that we are parsing the

47:15.600 --> 47:23.520
 universe in a particular way. Let me again go back to the gas molecules analogy. In the gas in this

47:23.520 --> 47:28.320
 room, there are molecules bouncing around all kinds of complicated patterns, but we don't care.

47:28.320 --> 47:34.960
 All we notice is there's, you know, the gas laws are satisfied. Maybe there's some fluid dynamics.

47:34.960 --> 47:40.480
 These are kind of features of that assembly of molecules that we notice, and then lots of details

47:40.480 --> 47:44.960
 we don't notice. When you say we, do you mean the tools of physics, or do you mean literally

47:44.960 --> 47:50.240
 the human brain and its perception system? Well, okay. So, the human brain is where it starts,

47:50.240 --> 47:53.840
 but we've built a bunch of instruments to do a bit better than the human brain, but they still

47:53.840 --> 47:58.640
 have many of the same kinds of ideas, you know, their cameras and their pressure sensors and

47:58.640 --> 48:04.160
 these kinds of things. They're not, you know, at this point, we don't know how to make

48:04.160 --> 48:09.440
 fundamentally qualitatively different sensory devices. Right. So, it's always just an extension

48:09.440 --> 48:14.720
 of the consciousness experience. Or our sensory experience. Sensory experience, but

48:14.720 --> 48:20.240
 sensory experience is somehow intricately tied to consciousness. Right. Well, so one question is,

48:20.240 --> 48:24.480
 when we are looking at all these molecules in the gas, and there might be 10 to the 20th molecules

48:24.480 --> 48:30.240
 in some little box or something, it's like, what do we notice about those molecules? So,

48:30.240 --> 48:36.640
 one thing that we can say is, we don't notice that much. We are, you know, we are computationally

48:36.640 --> 48:43.120
 bounded observers. We can't go in and say, okay, I'm the 10 to the 20th molecules, and I know

48:43.120 --> 48:47.440
 that I can sort of decrypt their motions, and I can figure out this and that. It's like, I'm just

48:47.440 --> 48:52.640
 going to say, what's the average density of molecules? And so, one key feature of us is that

48:52.640 --> 48:57.920
 we are computationally bounded. And that when you are looking at a universe which is full of

48:57.920 --> 49:03.920
 computation and doing huge amounts of computation, but we are computationally bounded, there's only

49:03.920 --> 49:08.240
 certain things about that universe that we're going to be sensitive to. We're not going to be,

49:08.240 --> 49:13.040
 you know, figuring out what all the atoms of space are doing, because we're just computationally

49:13.040 --> 49:19.920
 bounded observers, and we are only sampling these small set of features. So, I think the

49:19.920 --> 49:25.040
 two defining features of consciousness that, and I, you know, I would say that the sort of the

49:25.040 --> 49:30.480
 preamble to this is, for years, you know, as I've talked about sort of computation and fundamental

49:30.480 --> 49:36.800
 features of physics and science, people ask me, so what about consciousness? And I, for years,

49:36.800 --> 49:40.480
 I've said, I have nothing to say about consciousness. And, you know, I've kind of

49:40.480 --> 49:45.040
 told this story, you know, you talk about intelligence, you talk about life. These are

49:45.040 --> 49:49.200
 both features where you say, what's the abstract definition of life? We don't really know the

49:49.200 --> 49:53.680
 abstract definition. We know the one for life on Earth, it's got RNA, it's got cell membranes,

49:53.680 --> 49:58.480
 it's got all this kind of stuff. Similarly for intelligence, we know the human definition of

49:58.480 --> 50:03.600
 intelligence, but what is intelligence abstractly? We don't really know. And so, what I've long

50:03.600 --> 50:09.440
 believed is that sort of the abstract definition of intelligence is just computational sophistication.

50:09.440 --> 50:14.880
 That is, that as soon as you can be computationally sophisticated, that's kind of the abstract

50:14.880 --> 50:20.080
 version, the generalized version of intelligence. So, then the question is, what about consciousness?

50:20.080 --> 50:26.000
 And what I sort of realized is that consciousness is actually a step down from intelligence. That

50:26.000 --> 50:32.800
 is, that you might think, oh, you know, consciousness is the top of the pie, but it's

50:32.800 --> 50:37.440
 the top of the pile. But actually, I don't think it is. I think that there's this notion of kind

50:37.440 --> 50:42.560
 of computational sophistication, which is the generalized intelligence. But consciousness

50:42.560 --> 50:47.760
 has two limitations, I think. One of them is computational boundedness. That is, that we're

50:47.760 --> 50:53.760
 only perceiving a sort of computationally bounded view of the universe. And the other is this idea

50:53.760 --> 50:59.920
 of a single thread of time. That is, that we, and in fact, we know neurophysiologically our brains

50:59.920 --> 51:05.760
 go to some trouble to give us this one thread of attention, so to speak. And it isn't the case that

51:05.760 --> 51:12.640
 in all the neurons in our brains that, at least in our conscious, the correspondence of language,

51:12.640 --> 51:17.280
 in our conscious experience, we just have the single thread of attention, single thread of

51:17.920 --> 51:23.680
 perception. And maybe there's something unconscious that's bubbling around that's the kind of

51:23.680 --> 51:28.160
 almost the quantum version of what's happening in our brain, so to speak. We've got the classical

51:28.160 --> 51:33.600
 flow of what we are mostly thinking about, so to speak. But there's this kind of bubbling around

51:33.600 --> 51:38.800
 of other paths that is all those other neurons that didn't make it to be part of our sort of

51:38.800 --> 51:44.560
 conscious stream of experience. So in that sense, intelligence as computational sophistication is

51:44.560 --> 51:54.240
 much broader than the computational constraints which consciousness operates under, and also the

51:54.240 --> 51:59.920
 sequential, like the sequential thing, like the notion of time. That's kind of interesting. But

51:59.920 --> 52:05.360
 then the follow up question is like, okay, starting to get a sense of what is intelligence, and how

52:05.360 --> 52:12.720
 does that connect to our human brain? Because you're saying intelligence is almost like a fabric,

52:12.720 --> 52:18.240
 like what we like plug into it or something, like our consciousness plugs into it.

52:18.240 --> 52:23.520
 Yeah, I mean, the intelligence, I think the core, I mean, you know, intelligence at some

52:23.520 --> 52:28.880
 level is just a word, but we are asking, you know, what is the notion of intelligence as we

52:28.880 --> 52:33.760
 generalize it beyond the bounds of humans, beyond the bounds of even the AIs that we humans have

52:33.760 --> 52:39.600
 built and so on? You know, what is intelligence? You know, is the weather, you know, people say the

52:39.600 --> 52:43.200
 weather has a mind of its own. What does that mean? You know, can the weather be intelligent?

52:43.840 --> 52:48.320
 Yeah. What does agency have to do with intelligence here? So is intelligence just

52:48.320 --> 52:54.640
 like your conception of computation, just intelligence is the capacity to perform

52:54.640 --> 52:59.840
 computation and the sea of? Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think that's right. And I think that,

52:59.840 --> 53:07.120
 you know, this question of, is it for a purpose? Okay, that quickly degenerates into a horrible

53:07.120 --> 53:12.800
 philosophical mess. Because, you know, whenever you say, did the weather do that for a purpose?

53:12.800 --> 53:17.440
 Yeah. Right? Well, yes, it did. It was trying to move a bunch of hot air from the equator to the

53:17.440 --> 53:23.760
 poles or something. That's its purpose. But why? Because I seem to be equally as dumb today as I

53:23.760 --> 53:30.880
 was yesterday. So there's some persistence, like a consistency over time that the intelligence

53:30.880 --> 53:37.280
 I plugged into. So like, what's, it seems like there's a hard constraint between the amount of

53:37.280 --> 53:42.720
 computation I can perform in my consciousness. Like they seem to be really closely connected

53:42.720 --> 53:48.720
 somehow. Well, I think the point is that the thing that gives you kind of the ability to have

53:48.720 --> 53:56.400
 kind of conscious intelligence, you can have kind of this, okay, so one thing is we don't know

53:57.040 --> 54:02.880
 intelligences other than the ones that are very much like us. Yes. Right. And the ones that are

54:02.880 --> 54:07.680
 very much like us, I think have this feature of single thread of time, bounded, you know,

54:07.680 --> 54:14.000
 computationally bounded. But you also need computational sophistication. Having a single

54:14.000 --> 54:19.920
 thread of time and being computationally bounded, you could just be a clock going tick tock. That

54:19.920 --> 54:27.840
 would satisfy those conditions. But the fact that we have this sort of irreducible computational

54:27.840 --> 54:34.640
 ability, that's an important feature. That's sort of the bedrock on which we can construct

54:34.640 --> 54:40.800
 the things we construct. Now, the fact that we have this experience of the world that has the

54:40.800 --> 54:47.120
 single thread of time and computational boundedness, the thing that I sort of realized is it's that

54:47.120 --> 54:52.800
 that causes us to deduce from this irreducible mess of what's going on in the physical world,

54:53.440 --> 55:00.720
 the laws of physics that we think exist. So in other words, if we say, why do we believe that

55:00.720 --> 55:06.480
 there is, you know, continuous space, let's say, why do we believe that gravity works the way it

55:06.480 --> 55:14.560
 does? Well, in principle, we could be kind of parsing details of the universe that were, you

55:14.560 --> 55:22.560
 know, that OK, the analogy is, again, with the statistical mechanics and molecules in a box,

55:22.560 --> 55:27.120
 we could be sensitive to every little detail of the swirling around of those molecules. And we

55:27.120 --> 55:33.200
 could say what really matters is the, you know, the wiggle effect that is, you know, that is

55:33.200 --> 55:37.440
 something that we humans just never noticed because it's some weird thing that happens when

55:37.440 --> 55:42.720
 there are 15 collisions of air molecules and this happens and that happens. We just see the pure

55:42.720 --> 55:49.600
 motion of a ball moving about. Right. Why do we see that? Right. And the point is that that what

55:49.600 --> 55:55.280
 seems to be the case is that the things that if we say, given this sort of hypergraph that's

55:55.280 --> 56:00.640
 updating and all the details about all the sort of atoms of space and what they do, and we say,

56:00.640 --> 56:06.080
 how do we slice that to what we can be sensitive to? What seems to be the case is that as soon as

56:06.080 --> 56:12.080
 we assume, you know, computational boundedness, single thread of time, that leads us to general

56:12.080 --> 56:17.920
 relativity. In other words, we can't avoid that. That's the way that we will parse the universe.

56:17.920 --> 56:24.720
 Given those constraints, we parse the universe according to those particular in such a way that

56:24.720 --> 56:33.200
 we say the aggregate reducible sort of pocket of computational reducibility that we slice out of

56:33.200 --> 56:38.880
 this kind of whole computational irreducible ocean of behavior is just this one that corresponds to

56:38.880 --> 56:44.160
 general relativity. Yeah, but we don't perceive general relativity. Well, we do if we do fancy

56:44.160 --> 56:49.600
 experiments. So you're saying so perceive really does mean the full. We drop something. That's a

56:49.600 --> 56:54.080
 great example of general relativity in action. No, but like what's the difference in that and

56:54.080 --> 56:58.720
 Newtonian mechanics? I mean, oh, it doesn't. This is when I say general relativity, that's

57:00.000 --> 57:05.920
 the uber theory, so to speak. I mean, Newtonian gravity is just the approximation that we can make,

57:05.920 --> 57:11.600
 you know, on the earth and things like that. So this is, you know, the phenomenon of gravity

57:11.600 --> 57:17.040
 is one that is a consequence of, you know, we would perceive something very different from

57:17.040 --> 57:26.160
 gravity. So so the way to understand that is when we think about OK, so we make up reference frames

57:26.160 --> 57:31.120
 with which we parse what's happening in space and time. So in other words, one of the one of

57:31.120 --> 57:40.240
 the things that we do is we say as time progresses everywhere in space is something happens at a

57:40.240 --> 57:44.560
 particular time and then we go to the next time and we say this is what space is like at the next

57:44.560 --> 57:50.720
 time is what space is like at the next time. That's it's the reason we are used to doing that

57:51.280 --> 57:56.160
 is because, you know, when we look around, we might see, you know, ten hundred meters away.

57:57.200 --> 58:02.320
 The time it takes light to travel that distance is really short compared to the time it takes our

58:02.320 --> 58:08.320
 brains to know what happened. So as far as our brains are concerned, we are parsing the universe

58:08.320 --> 58:12.640
 in this. There is a moment in time, it's all of space. There's a moment in time, it's all of

58:12.640 --> 58:17.440
 space. If we were the size of planets or something, we would have a different perception because the

58:17.440 --> 58:21.920
 speed of light would be much more important to us. We wouldn't have this perception that

58:22.720 --> 58:28.160
 things happen progressively in time everywhere in space. And so that's an important kind of

58:28.160 --> 58:33.760
 constraint. And the reason that we kind of parse the universe in the way that causes us to say

58:33.760 --> 58:39.520
 gravity works the way it does is because we're doing things like deciding that we can say the

58:39.520 --> 58:45.680
 universe exists, space has a definite structure. There is a moment in time, space has this definite

58:45.680 --> 58:50.640
 structure. We move to the next moment in time, space has another structure. That kind of setup

58:50.640 --> 58:58.000
 is what lets us kind of deduce kind of what parse the universe in such a way that we say gravity

58:58.000 --> 59:05.280
 works the way it does. So that kind of reference frame is that the illusion of that is that you're

59:05.280 --> 59:11.040
 saying that's somehow useful for consciousness. That's what consciousness does. Because in a

59:11.040 --> 59:19.520
 sense, what consciousness is doing is it's insisting that the universe is kind of sequentialized.

59:21.040 --> 59:25.520
 And it is not allowing the possibility that, oh, there are these multiple threads of time

59:25.520 --> 59:31.760
 and they're all flowing differently. It's like saying, no, everything is happening in this one

59:31.760 --> 59:36.160
 thread of experience that we have. And that illusion of that one thread of experience

59:36.160 --> 59:41.760
 cannot happen at the planetary scale. Are you saying typical human, are you saying we are at a

59:41.760 --> 59:49.280
 human level is special here for consciousness? Well, for our kind of consciousness, if we existed

59:49.280 --> 59:53.600
 at a scale close to the elementary length, for example, then our perception of the universe

59:53.600 --> 59:58.720
 will be absurdly different. Okay. But this makes consciousness seem like a weird side effect to

59:58.720 --> 1:00:04.080
 this particular scale. And so who cares? I mean, consciousness is not that special.

1:00:05.680 --> 1:00:09.520
 Look, I think that a very interesting question is, which I've certainly thought a little bit about,

1:00:10.160 --> 1:00:16.000
 is what can you imagine? What is a sort of factoring of something? What are some other

1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:23.840
 possible ways you could exist, so to speak? And if you were a photon, if you were some kind of thing

1:00:23.840 --> 1:00:30.480
 that was kind of, you know, intelligence represented in terms of photons, you know,

1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:35.280
 for example, the photons we receive in the cosmic microwave background, those photons,

1:00:35.280 --> 1:00:39.520
 as far as they're concerned, the universe just started. They were emitted, you know,

1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:43.200
 100,000 years after the beginning of the universe, they've been traveling at the speed of light,

1:00:43.200 --> 1:00:49.280
 time stayed still for them, and then they just arrived and we just detected them. So for them,

1:00:49.280 --> 1:00:53.920
 the universe just started. And that's a different perception of, you know, that has

1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:57.760
 implications for a very different perception of time. They don't have that single thread

1:00:57.760 --> 1:01:01.840
 that seems to be really important for being able to tell a heck of a good story.

1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:07.920
 So we humans, we can tell a story. Right. We can tell a story. What other kind of stories can you

1:01:07.920 --> 1:01:13.040
 tell? So photon is a really boring story. Yeah. I mean, so that's a, I don't know if they're a

1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:17.760
 boring story, but I think it's, you know, I've been wondering about this and I've been asking,

1:01:17.760 --> 1:01:20.960
 you know, friends of mine who are science fiction writers and things, have you written stuff about

1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:28.240
 this? And I've got one example, a great collection of books from my friend Rudy Rooker, which I have

1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:34.640
 to say, they're books that are very informed by a bunch of science that I've done. And the thing

1:01:34.640 --> 1:01:41.360
 that I really loved about them is, you know, in the first chapter of the book, the Earth is consumed

1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:47.920
 by these things called nants, which are nano, nanobot type things. So, you know, so the Earth

1:01:47.920 --> 1:01:53.760
 is gone in the first, but then it comes back. But then, yeah, right. That was only a micro

1:01:53.760 --> 1:02:01.600
 spoiler. It's only chapter one. But the thing that is not a real spoiler alert because it's

1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:07.920
 such a complicated concept, but in the end, the Earth is saved by this thing called the

1:02:07.920 --> 1:02:12.640
 principle of computational equivalence, which is a kind of a core scientific idea of mine.

1:02:12.640 --> 1:02:17.760
 And I was just like, like thrilled. I don't read fiction books very often. And I was just thrilled.

1:02:17.760 --> 1:02:22.480
 I get to the end of this and it's like, oh, my gosh, you know, everything is saved by this sort

1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:27.920
 of deep scientific principle. Can you maybe elaborate how the principle of computational

1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:36.240
 equivalence can save a planet? That would, that would be a terrible spoiler. That would be a

1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:42.720
 spoiler. But no, but let me say what the principle of computational equivalence is. So the question

1:02:42.720 --> 1:02:48.800
 is, you are, you have a system, you have some rule, you can think of its behavior as corresponding

1:02:48.800 --> 1:02:54.560
 to a computation. The question is, how sophisticated is that computation? The statement of the principle

1:02:54.560 --> 1:03:00.640
 of computational equivalence is, as soon as it's not obviously simple, it will be as sophisticated

1:03:00.640 --> 1:03:07.280
 as anything. And so that has the implication that, you know, rule 30, you know, our brains,

1:03:07.280 --> 1:03:12.080
 other things in physics, they're all ultimately equivalent in the computations they can do.

1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:16.480
 And that's what leads to this computational irreducibility idea because the reason we don't

1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:22.080
 get to jump ahead, you know, and out think rule 30 is because we're just computationally equivalent

1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:28.160
 to rule 30. So we're kind of just both just running computations that are the same sort of

1:03:28.160 --> 1:03:34.320
 raw, the same level of computation, so to speak. So that's kind of the idea there. And the question,

1:03:34.320 --> 1:03:41.200
 I mean, it's like the, you know, in the science fiction version would be, okay, somebody says,

1:03:41.200 --> 1:03:46.640
 we just need more servers, get us more servers. The way to get even more servers is turn the

1:03:46.640 --> 1:03:53.520
 whole planet into a bunch of microservers. And that's where it starts. And so the question of,

1:03:53.520 --> 1:03:57.600
 you know, computational equivalence, principle of computational equivalence is, well, actually,

1:03:57.600 --> 1:04:06.080
 you don't need to build those custom servers. Actually, you can just use natural computation

1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:11.120
 to compute things, so to speak. You can use nature to compute. You don't need to have done

1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:16.480
 all that engineering. I mean, it kind of feels a little disappointing that you say, we're going to

1:04:16.480 --> 1:04:19.920
 build all these servers. We're going to do all these things. We're going to make, you know,

1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:25.120
 maybe we're going to have human consciousness uploaded into, you know, some elaborate digital

1:04:25.120 --> 1:04:29.520
 environment. And then you look at that thing and you say, it's got electrons moving around,

1:04:29.520 --> 1:04:33.760
 just like in a rock. And then you say, well, what's the difference? And the principle of

1:04:33.760 --> 1:04:39.920
 computational equivalence says there isn't, at some level, a fundamental, you know, you can't say,

1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:45.440
 mathematically, there's a fundamental difference between the rock that is the future of human

1:04:45.440 --> 1:04:51.120
 consciousness and the rock that's just a rock. Now, what I've sort of realized with this kind

1:04:51.120 --> 1:04:59.200
 of consciousness thing is there is an aspect of this that seems to be more special. And for

1:04:59.200 --> 1:05:03.920
 example, something I haven't really teased apart properly is when it comes to something like the

1:05:03.920 --> 1:05:07.600
 weather and the weather having a mind of its own or whatever, or your average, you know,

1:05:07.600 --> 1:05:13.520
 pulsar magnetosphere acting like a sort of intelligent thing, how does that relate to,

1:05:13.520 --> 1:05:21.360
 you know, how is that entity related to the kind of consciousness that we have? And sort of,

1:05:21.360 --> 1:05:25.920
 what would the world look like, you know, to the weather? If we think about the weather as a mind,

1:05:26.480 --> 1:05:30.880
 what will it perceive? What will its laws of physics be? I don't really know.

1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:33.280
 Because it's very parallel.

1:05:33.280 --> 1:05:39.360
 It's very parallel, among other things. And it's not obvious. I mean, this is a really kind of

1:05:39.360 --> 1:05:46.480
 mindbending thing because we've got to try and imagine a parsing of the universe different from

1:05:46.480 --> 1:05:51.760
 the one we have. And by the way, when we think about extraterrestrial intelligence and so on,

1:05:51.760 --> 1:05:57.040
 I think that's kind of the key thing is, you know, we've always assumed, I've always assumed,

1:05:57.040 --> 1:06:01.680
 okay, the extraterrestrials, at least they have the same physics. We all live in the same universe.

1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:07.200
 They've got the same physics. But actually, that's not really right because the extraterrestrials

1:06:07.200 --> 1:06:12.960
 could have a completely different way of parsing the universe. So it's as if, you know, there could

1:06:12.960 --> 1:06:17.680
 be for all we know, right here in this room, you know, in the details of the motion of these gas

1:06:17.680 --> 1:06:24.800
 molecules, there could be an amazing intelligence that we were like, but we have no way of, we're

1:06:24.800 --> 1:06:29.360
 not parsing the universe in the same way. If only we could parse the universe in the right way,

1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:34.400
 you know, immediately this amazing thing that's going on and this, you know, huge culture that's

1:06:34.400 --> 1:06:38.240
 developed and all that kind of thing would be obvious to us, but it's not because we have our

1:06:38.240 --> 1:06:43.440
 particular way of parsing the universe. Would that thing also have an agency? I don't know the right

1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:47.920
 word to use, but something like consciousness, but a different kind of consciousness?

1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:51.360
 I think it's a question of just what you mean by the word, because I think that the,

1:06:51.360 --> 1:06:56.480
 you know, this notion of consciousness and the, okay, so some people think of consciousness as

1:06:56.480 --> 1:07:03.840
 sort of a key aspect of it is that we feel that there's sort of a feeling of that we exist in

1:07:03.840 --> 1:07:11.040
 some way, that we have this intrinsic feeling about ourselves. You know, I suspect that any

1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:14.720
 of these things would also have an intrinsic feeling about themselves. I've been sort of

1:07:14.720 --> 1:07:19.680
 trying to think recently about constructing an experiment about what if you were just a piece

1:07:19.680 --> 1:07:24.480
 of a cellular automaton, let's say, you know, what would your feeling about yourself actually be?

1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:30.480
 And, you know, can we put ourselves in the shoes, in the cells of the cellular automaton,

1:07:30.480 --> 1:07:36.640
 so to speak? Can we get ourselves close enough to that, that we could have a sense of what the

1:07:36.640 --> 1:07:42.240
 world would be like if you were operating in that way? And it's a little difficult because,

1:07:42.240 --> 1:07:46.880
 you know, you have to not only think about what are you perceiving, but also what's actually

1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:52.560
 going on in your brain. And our brains do what they actually do. And they don't, it's, you know,

1:07:52.560 --> 1:07:57.840
 I think there might be some experiments that are possible with neural nets and so on,

1:07:57.840 --> 1:08:02.080
 where you can have something where you can at least see in detail what's happening inside the

1:08:02.080 --> 1:08:10.320
 system. And one of my projects to think about is, is there a way of kind of getting a sense

1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:16.160
 kind of from inside the system about what its view of the world is and how it, you know,

1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:23.360
 can we make a bridge? See, the main issue is this. It's a sort of philosophically difficult thing

1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:29.360
 because it's like we do what we do. We understand ourselves, at least to some extent.

1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:30.800
 We humans understand ourselves.

1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:35.920
 That's correct. But yet, okay, so what are we trying to do, for example, when we are trying to

1:08:35.920 --> 1:08:40.160
 make a model of physics? What are we actually trying to do? Because, you know, you say, well,

1:08:40.160 --> 1:08:44.320
 can we work out what the universe does? Well, of course we can. We just watch the universe. The

1:08:44.320 --> 1:08:49.040
 universe does what it does. But what we're trying to do when we make a model of physics is we're

1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:54.880
 trying to get to the point where we can tell a story to ourselves that we understand that is also

1:08:54.880 --> 1:08:59.680
 a representation of what the universe does. So it's this kind of, you know, can we make a bridge

1:08:59.680 --> 1:09:05.360
 between what we humans can understand in our minds and what the universe does? And in a sense,

1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:11.600
 you know, a large part of my kind of life efforts have been devoted to making computational

1:09:11.600 --> 1:09:16.720
 language, which kind of is a bridge between what is possible in the computational universe

1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:22.640
 and what we humans can conceptualize and think about. In a sense, when I built Wolfram Language

1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:28.560
 and our whole sort of computational language story, it's all about how do you take sort of raw

1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:33.760
 computation and this ocean of computational possibility and how do we sort of represent

1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:39.520
 pieces of it in a way that we humans can understand and that map onto things that we care about doing.

1:09:39.520 --> 1:09:44.480
 And in a sense, when you add physics, you're adding this other piece where we can, you know,

1:09:44.480 --> 1:09:50.560
 mediated by computer, can we get physics to the point where we humans can understand something

1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:55.200
 about what's happening in it? And when we talk about an alien intelligence, it's kind of the

1:09:55.200 --> 1:10:00.960
 same story. It's like, is there a way of mapping what's happening there onto something that we

1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:08.800
 humans can understand? And, you know, physics in some sense is like our exhibit one of the story

1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:15.600
 of alien intelligence. It's an alien intelligence in some sense. And what we're doing in making a

1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:21.200
 model of physics is mapping that onto something that we understand. And I think, you know, a lot

1:10:21.200 --> 1:10:26.320
 of these other things that I've recently been kind of studying, whether it's molecular biology,

1:10:26.320 --> 1:10:33.760
 other kinds of things, which we can talk about a bit, those are other cases where we're in a sense

1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:39.280
 trying to, again, make that bridge between what we humans understand and sort of the natural

1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:43.280
 language of that sort of alien intelligence in some sense. When you're talking about,

1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:51.840
 just to backtrack a little bit about cellular automata, being able to, what's it like to be

1:10:51.840 --> 1:10:58.560
 a cellular automata in the way that's equivalent to what is it like to be a conscious human being?

1:10:58.560 --> 1:11:04.240
 How do you approach that? So is it looking at some subset of the cellular automata, asking questions

1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:13.920
 of that subset, like how the world is perceived, how you as that subset, like for that local pocket

1:11:13.920 --> 1:11:20.320
 of computation, what are you able to say about the broader cellular time? And that somehow then

1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:25.760
 can give you a sense of how to step outside of that cellular time. Right, but the tricky part is

1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:33.440
 that that little subset, what it's doing is it has a view of itself. And the question is,

1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:40.320
 how do you get inside it? It's like when we, with humans, it's like we can't get inside each other's

1:11:40.320 --> 1:11:47.360
 consciousness. That doesn't really even make sense. It's like there is an experience that

1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:52.640
 somebody is having, but you can perceive things from the outside, but sort of getting inside

1:11:52.640 --> 1:11:58.160
 it, it doesn't quite make sense. And for me, these sort of philosophical issues, and this one I have

1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:04.640
 not untangled, so let's be... For me, the thing that has been really interesting in thinking

1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:09.760
 through some of these things is when it comes to questions about consciousness or whatever else,

1:12:09.760 --> 1:12:16.400
 it's like when I can run a program and actually see pictures and make things concrete, I have a

1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:20.160
 much better chance to understand what's going on than when I'm just trying to figure out what's

1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:24.240
 going on. I have a much better chance to understand what's going on than when I'm just trying to

1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:32.800
 reason about things in a very abstract way. Yeah, but there may be a way to map the program to your

1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:37.120
 conscious experience. So for example, when you play a video game, you do a first person shooter,

1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:43.920
 you walk around inside this entity. It's a very different thing than watching this entity. So

1:12:43.920 --> 1:12:51.120
 connect more and more, connect this full conscious experience to the subset of the cellular automata.

1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:55.280
 Yeah, it's something like that. But the difference in the first person shooter thing is there's still

1:12:55.280 --> 1:13:02.960
 your brain and your memory is still remembering. You still have... It's hard to... I mean, again,

1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:08.000
 what one's going to get, one is not going to actually be able to be the cellular automaton.

1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:12.080
 One's going to be able to watch what the cellular automaton does. But this is the frustrating thing

1:13:12.080 --> 1:13:18.080
 that I'm trying to understand how to think about being it, so to speak.

1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:21.920
 Okay. So like in virtual reality, there's a concept of immersion, like with anything,

1:13:21.920 --> 1:13:26.880
 with video games, with books, there's a concept of immersion. It feels like over time, if the

1:13:26.880 --> 1:13:32.880
 virtual reality experience is well done, and maybe in the future it'll be extremely well done,

1:13:33.680 --> 1:13:40.960
 the immersion leads you to feel like... You mentioned memories. You forget that you even

1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:46.480
 ever existed outside that experience. It's so immersive. I mean, you could argue sort of

1:13:46.480 --> 1:13:52.880
 mathematically that you can never truly become immersed, but maybe you can. I mean, why can't you

1:13:52.880 --> 1:13:58.400
 merge with the cellular automata? I mean, aren't you just part of the same fabric? Why can't you

1:13:58.400 --> 1:14:02.960
 just like... Well, that's a good question. I mean, so let's imagine the following scenario. Let's

1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:08.400
 imagine... Can you return? But then can you return back? Well, yeah, right. I mean, it's like,

1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:14.320
 let's imagine you've uploaded, your brain is scanned, you've got every synapse mapped out,

1:14:14.320 --> 1:14:18.960
 you upload everything about you, the brain simulator, you upload the brain simulator,

1:14:18.960 --> 1:14:25.040
 and the brain simulator is basically some glorified cellular automaton. And then you say,

1:14:25.040 --> 1:14:28.560
 well, now we've got an answer to what does it feel like to be a cellular automaton?

1:14:28.560 --> 1:14:34.480
 It feels just like it felt to be ordinary you, because they're both computational systems,

1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:39.760
 and they're both operating in the same way. But I think there's somehow more to it,

1:14:39.760 --> 1:14:46.000
 because in that sense, when you're just making a brain simulator, we're just saying there's

1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:50.960
 another version of our consciousness. The question that we're asking is, if we tease away from our

1:14:50.960 --> 1:14:55.840
 consciousness and get to something that is different, how do we make a bridge to understanding

1:14:55.840 --> 1:15:00.880
 what's going on there? And there's a way of thinking about this. Okay, so this is coming

1:15:00.880 --> 1:15:05.440
 on to questions about the existence of the universe and so on. But one of the things is

1:15:05.440 --> 1:15:11.600
 there's this notion that we have of ruleal space. So we have this idea of this physical space,

1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:17.200
 which is something you can move around in that's associated with the extent of the

1:15:17.200 --> 1:15:22.480
 spatial hypergraph. Then there's what we call branchial space, the space of quantum branches.

1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:28.000
 So in this thing we call the multiway graph of all of this branching histories,

1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:32.560
 there's this idea of a kind of space where instead of moving around in physical space,

1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:36.560
 you're moving from history to history, so to speak, from one possible history to another

1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:42.160
 possible history. And that's kind of a different kind of space that is the space in which quantum

1:15:42.160 --> 1:15:48.960
 mechanics plays out. Quantum mechanics, for example, I think we're slowly understanding

1:15:48.960 --> 1:15:53.600
 things like destructive interference in quantum mechanics, that what's happening is branchial

1:15:53.600 --> 1:15:58.080
 space is associated with phase in quantum mechanics. And what's happening is the two

1:15:58.080 --> 1:16:02.480
 photons that are supposed to be interfering and destructively interfering are winding up at

1:16:02.480 --> 1:16:09.200
 different ends of branchial space. And so us as these poor observers that have branching brains

1:16:09.200 --> 1:16:13.440
 that are trying to conflate together these different threads of history and say,

1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:17.040
 we've really got a consistent story that we're telling here. We're really knitting together

1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:22.000
 these threads of history. By the time the two photons wound up at opposite ends of branchial

1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:26.880
 space, we just can't knit them together to tell a consistent story. So for us,

1:16:26.880 --> 1:16:30.800
 that's sort of the analog of destructive interference. Got it. And then there's

1:16:30.800 --> 1:16:37.520
 rule space too, which is the space of rules. Yes. Well, that's another level up. So there's

1:16:37.520 --> 1:16:42.240
 the question. Actually, I do want to mention one thing because it's something I've realized in

1:16:42.240 --> 1:16:46.640
 recent times and I think it's really, really kind of cool, which is about time dilation and

1:16:46.640 --> 1:16:51.520
 relativity. And it kind of helps to understand it's something that kind of helps in understanding

1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:58.240
 what's going on. So according to relativity, if you have a clock, it's ticking at a certain rate,

1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:03.040
 you send it in a spacecraft that's going at some significant fraction of the speed of light,

1:17:03.600 --> 1:17:09.920
 to you as an observer at rest, that clock that's in the spacecraft will seem to be ticking much

1:17:09.920 --> 1:17:16.720
 more slowly. And so in other words, it's kind of like the twin who goes off to Alpha Centauri and

1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:22.640
 goes very fast will age much less than the twin who's on Earth that is just hanging out where

1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:27.920
 they're hanging out. Okay, why does that happen? Okay, so it has to do with what motion is.

1:17:28.720 --> 1:17:34.400
 So in our models of physics, what is motion? Well, when you move from somewhere to somewhere,

1:17:35.360 --> 1:17:39.600
 you're having to sort of recreate yourself at a different place in space.

1:17:40.480 --> 1:17:46.080
 When you exist at a particular place and you just evolve with time, again, you're updating yourself,

1:17:46.080 --> 1:17:51.200
 you're following these rules to update what happens. Well, so the question is, when you

1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:55.440
 have a certain amount of computation in you, so to speak, when there's a certain amount,

1:17:55.440 --> 1:17:59.520
 you know, you're computing, the universe is computing at a certain rate, you can either

1:17:59.520 --> 1:18:05.360
 use that computation to work out sitting still where you are, what's going to happen successively

1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:10.480
 in time, or you can use that computation to recreate yourself as you move around the universe.

1:18:10.480 --> 1:18:16.000
 Mm hmm. And so time dilation ends up being, it's really cool, actually, that this is explainable

1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:21.920
 in a way that isn't just imagine the mathematics of relativity. But time dilation is a story of

1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:27.840
 the fact that as you kind of are recreating yourself as you move, you are using up some

1:18:27.840 --> 1:18:33.120
 of your computation. And so you don't have as much computation left over to actually work out what

1:18:33.120 --> 1:18:38.880
 happens progressively with time. So that means that time is running more slowly for you because

1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:45.600
 it is, you're using up your computation, your clock can't tick as quickly, because every tick

1:18:45.600 --> 1:18:50.160
 of the clock is using up some computation, but you already use that computation up on moving at,

1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:54.800
 you know, half the speed of light or something. And so that's why time dilation happens.

1:18:55.520 --> 1:19:00.560
 And so you can start, so it's kind of interesting that one can sort of get an intuition about

1:19:00.560 --> 1:19:05.520
 something like that, because it has seemed like just a mathematical fact about the mathematics of

1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:10.560
 special relativity and so on. Well, for me, it's a little bit confusing what the you in that picture

1:19:10.560 --> 1:19:19.840
 is, because you're using up computation. Okay, so we're simply saying the entity is updating

1:19:19.840 --> 1:19:26.800
 itself according to the way that the universe updates itself. And the question is, you know,

1:19:26.800 --> 1:19:31.680
 those updates, let's imagine the you as a clock. Okay. And the clock is, you know, there's all

1:19:31.680 --> 1:19:37.120
 these little updates, the hypergraph and a sequence of updates cause the pendulum to swing back the

1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:44.240
 other way, and then swing back, swinging back and forth. Okay. And all of those updates are

1:19:44.240 --> 1:19:48.240
 contributing to the motion of, you know, the pendulum going back and forth or the little

1:19:48.240 --> 1:19:54.480
 oscillator moving, whatever it is. Okay. But then the alternative is that sort of situation one,

1:19:54.480 --> 1:20:00.880
 where the thing is at rest, situation two, where it's kind of moving, what's happening is it is

1:20:00.880 --> 1:20:07.520
 having to recreate itself at every moment, the thing is going to have to do the computations

1:20:07.520 --> 1:20:12.480
 to be able to sort of recreate itself at a different position in space. And that's kind of

1:20:12.480 --> 1:20:17.760
 the intuition behind, so it's either going to spend its computation recreating itself at a

1:20:17.760 --> 1:20:24.240
 different position in space, or it's going to spend its computation doing the sort of doing the

1:20:24.240 --> 1:20:30.240
 updating of the, you know, of the ticking of the clock, so to speak. So the more updating is doing,

1:20:30.240 --> 1:20:35.120
 the less the ticking of the clock update is doing. That's right. The more it's having to update

1:20:35.120 --> 1:20:42.640
 because of motion, the less it can update the clock. Obviously, there's a sort of mathematical

1:20:42.640 --> 1:20:47.200
 version of it that relates to how it actually works in relativity, but that's kind of, to me,

1:20:47.200 --> 1:20:52.560
 that was sort of exciting to me that it's possible to have a really mechanically explainable story

1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:58.320
 there. And similarly in quantum mechanics, this notion of branching brains perceiving branching

1:20:58.320 --> 1:21:03.200
 universes, to me, that's getting towards a sort of mechanically explainable version of what happens

1:21:03.200 --> 1:21:07.920
 in quantum mechanics, even though it's a little bit mind bending to see, you know, these things

1:21:07.920 --> 1:21:13.840
 about under what circumstances can you successfully knit together those different threads of history,

1:21:13.840 --> 1:21:21.040
 and when do things sort of escape, and those kinds of things. But the thing about this physical space

1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:26.960
 and physical space, the main sort of big theory is general relativity, the theory of gravity,

1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:32.240
 and that tells you how things move in physical space. In branchial space, the big theory is the

1:21:32.240 --> 1:21:38.320
 Feynman path integral, which it turns out tells you essentially how things move in quantum in the

1:21:38.320 --> 1:21:43.840
 space of quantum phases. So it's kind of like motion in branchial space. And it's kind of a

1:21:43.840 --> 1:21:51.280
 fun thing to start thinking about all these things that we know in physical space, like event horizons

1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:55.440
 and black holes and so on. What are the analogous things in branchial space? For example, the speed

1:21:55.440 --> 1:21:59.840
 of light, what's the analog of the speed of light in branchial space? It's the maximum speed of

1:21:59.840 --> 1:22:06.720
 quantum entanglement. So the speed of light is a flash bulb goes off here. What's the maximum rate

1:22:06.720 --> 1:22:13.280
 at which the effect of that flash bulb is detectable moving away in space? So similarly,

1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:18.400
 in branchial space, something happens. And the question is, how far in this branchial space,

1:22:18.400 --> 1:22:23.760
 in the space of quantum states, how far away can that get within a certain period of time?

1:22:23.760 --> 1:22:28.720
 And so there's this notion of a maximum entanglement speed. And that might be observable.

1:22:28.720 --> 1:22:32.800
 That's the thing we've been sort of poking at, is might there be a way to observe it,

1:22:32.800 --> 1:22:37.920
 even in some atomic physics kind of situation? Because one of the things that's weird in

1:22:37.920 --> 1:22:44.160
 quantum mechanics is when we study quantum mechanics, we mostly study it in terms of small

1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:49.200
 numbers of particles. This electron does this, this thing on an ion trap does that and so on.

1:22:49.200 --> 1:22:52.880
 But when we deal with large numbers of particles, kind of all bets are off. It's kind of too

1:22:52.880 --> 1:22:58.480
 complicated to deal with quantum mechanics. And so what ends up happening is, so this question

1:22:58.480 --> 1:23:04.320
 about maximum entanglement speed and things like that may actually play in the sort of story of

1:23:04.320 --> 1:23:10.320
 many body quantum mechanics and even have some suspicions about things that might happen even in

1:23:10.880 --> 1:23:15.840
 one of the things I realized I'd never understood and it's kind of embarrassing, but I think I now

1:23:15.840 --> 1:23:20.480
 understand a little better, is when you have chemistry and you have quantum mechanics,

1:23:20.480 --> 1:23:25.040
 it's like, well, there's two carbon atoms in this molecule and we do a reaction and we draw a

1:23:25.040 --> 1:23:29.280
 diagram and we say this carbon atom ends up in this place. And it's like, but wait a minute,

1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:32.800
 in quantum mechanics, nothing ends up in a definite place. There's always just some wave

1:23:32.800 --> 1:23:37.600
 function for this to happen. How can it be the case that we can draw these reasonable, it just

1:23:37.600 --> 1:23:42.000
 ended up in this place? And you have to kind of say, well, the environment of the molecule

1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:46.640
 effectively made a bunch of measurements on the molecule to keep it kind of classical.

1:23:46.640 --> 1:23:52.960
 And that's a story that has to do with this whole thing about measurements have to do with this

1:23:52.960 --> 1:23:58.400
 idea of, can we conclude that something definite happened? Because in quantum mechanics,

1:23:58.400 --> 1:24:02.400
 the intrinsic quantum mechanics, the mathematics of quantum mechanics is all about,

1:24:02.400 --> 1:24:06.320
 they're just these amplitudes for different things to happen. Then there's this thing of,

1:24:06.320 --> 1:24:11.040
 and then we make a measurement and we conclude that something definite happened. And that has

1:24:11.040 --> 1:24:16.000
 to do with this thing, I think, about sort of moving about knitting together these different

1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:20.320
 threads of history and saying, this is now something where we can definitively say something

1:24:20.320 --> 1:24:25.680
 definite happened. In the traditional theory of quantum mechanics, it's just like, after you've

1:24:25.680 --> 1:24:30.560
 done all this amplitude computation, then this big hammer comes down and you do a measurement

1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:34.640
 and it's all over. And that's been very confusing. For example, in quantum computing,

1:24:34.640 --> 1:24:39.680
 it's been a very confusing thing because when you say, in quantum computing, the basic idea is

1:24:39.680 --> 1:24:44.080
 you're going to use all these separate threads of computation, so to speak, to do all the different

1:24:44.080 --> 1:24:48.560
 parts of, try these different factors for an integer or something like this. And it looks

1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:53.680
 like you can do a lot because you've got all these different threads going on. But then you have to

1:24:53.680 --> 1:24:57.760
 say, well, at the end of it, you've got all these threads and every thread came up with a definite

1:24:57.760 --> 1:25:02.960
 answer, but we got to conflate those together to figure out a definite thing that we humans

1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:06.720
 can take away from it, a definite, so the computer actually produced this output.

1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:14.640
 So having this branchial space and this hypergraph model of physics, do you think it's possible to

1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:20.800
 then make predictions that are definite about many body quantum mechanical systems?

1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:28.800
 I think it's likely, yes. Every one of these things, when you go from the underlying theory,

1:25:28.800 --> 1:25:33.520
 which is complicated enough and it's, I mean, the theory at some level is beautifully simple,

1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:37.680
 but as soon as you start actually trying to, it's this whole question about how do you bridge it to

1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:43.440
 things that we humans can talk about, it gets really complicated. And this thing about actually

1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:50.320
 getting it to a definite prediction about definite thing you can say about chemistry or something

1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:54.560
 like this, that's just a lot of work. So I'll give you an example. There's a thing called the

1:25:54.560 --> 1:26:01.680
 quantum Zeno effect. So the idea is quantum stuff happens, but then if you make a measurement,

1:26:01.680 --> 1:26:08.000
 you're kind of freezing time in quantum mechanics. So it looks like there's a possibility that with

1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:12.240
 sort of the relationship between the quantum Zeno effect and the way that many body quantum

1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:18.240
 mechanics works and so on, maybe just conceivably, it may be possible to actually figure out a way

1:26:18.240 --> 1:26:23.920
 to measure the maximum entanglement speed. And the reason we can potentially do that

1:26:23.920 --> 1:26:29.360
 is because the systems we deal with in terms of atoms and things, they're pretty big. A mole of

1:26:29.360 --> 1:26:37.520
 atoms is a lot of atoms, but it's something where to get, when we're dealing with how can you see

1:26:37.520 --> 1:26:45.120
 10 to the minus 100, so to speak? Well, by the time you've got 10 to the 30th atoms, you're within

1:26:45.120 --> 1:26:51.760
 a little bit closer striking distance of that. It's not like, oh, we've just got two atoms and

1:26:51.760 --> 1:26:56.800
 we're trying to see down to 10 to the minus 100 meters or whatever. So I don't know how it will

1:26:56.800 --> 1:27:02.640
 work, but this is a potential direction. And if you can tell, by the way, if we could measure

1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:07.120
 the maximum entanglement speed, we would know the elementary length. These are all related.

1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:12.560
 So if we get that one number, we just need one number. If we can get that one number,

1:27:13.440 --> 1:27:20.240
 the theory has no parameters anymore. And there are other places, well, there's another hope for

1:27:20.240 --> 1:27:25.680
 doing that is in cosmology. In this model, one of the features is the universe is not fixed

1:27:25.680 --> 1:27:29.920
 dimensional. We think we live in three dimensional space, but this hypergraph doesn't have any

1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:36.320
 particular dimension. It can emerge as something which on an approximation, it's as if you say,

1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:41.600
 what's the volume of a sphere in the hypergraph where a sphere is defined as how many nodes do

1:27:41.600 --> 1:27:47.040
 you get to when you go a distance R away from a given point? And you can say, well, if I get to

1:27:47.040 --> 1:27:52.960
 about R cubed nodes, when I go a distance R away in the hypergraph, then I'm living roughly in

1:27:52.960 --> 1:28:02.800
 three dimensional space. But you might also get to R to the point 2.92 for some value of R. As R

1:28:02.800 --> 1:28:07.920
 increases, that might be the sort of fit to what happens. And so one of the things we suspect is

1:28:07.920 --> 1:28:12.560
 that the very early universe was essentially infinite dimensional, and that as the universe

1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:19.680
 expanded, it became lower dimensional. And so one of the things that is another little sort of point

1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:24.320
 where we think there might be a way to actually measure some things is dimension fluctuations in

1:28:24.320 --> 1:28:30.720
 the early universe. That is, is there leftover dimension fluctuation of at the time of the cosmic

1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:34.880
 microwave background, 100,000 years or something after the beginning of the universe? Is it still

1:28:34.880 --> 1:28:39.840
 the case that there were pieces of the universe that didn't have dimension three, that had

1:28:39.840 --> 1:28:47.920
 dimension 3.01 or something? And can we tell that? Is that possible to observe fluctuations in

1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:54.240
 dimensions? I don't even know what that entails. Okay. So the question, which should be an

1:28:54.240 --> 1:28:59.920
 elementary exercise in electrodynamics, except it isn't, is understanding what happens to a

1:28:59.920 --> 1:29:05.680
 photon when it propagates through 3.01 dimensional space. So for example, the inverse square law

1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:13.920
 is a consequence of the surface area of a sphere is proportional to R squared. But if you're not

1:29:13.920 --> 1:29:19.280
 in three dimensional space, the surface area of sphere is not proportional to R squared. It's R

1:29:19.280 --> 1:29:27.040
 to the whatever 2.01 or something. And so that means that I think when you kind of try and do

1:29:27.040 --> 1:29:32.960
 optics, you know, a common principle in optics is Huygens principle, which basically says that every

1:29:32.960 --> 1:29:40.560
 piece of a wave front of light is a source of new spherical waves. And those spherical waves,

1:29:40.560 --> 1:29:46.080
 if they're different dimensional spherical waves, will have other characteristics. And so there will

1:29:46.080 --> 1:29:53.680
 be bizarre optical phenomena which we haven't figured out yet. So you're looking for some weird

1:29:53.680 --> 1:30:01.360
 photon trajectories that designate that it's 3.01 dimensional space? Yeah. Yeah. That would be an

1:30:01.360 --> 1:30:05.200
 example of, I mean, you know, there are only a certain number of things we can measure about

1:30:05.200 --> 1:30:09.360
 photons. You know, we can measure their polarization, we can measure their frequency,

1:30:09.360 --> 1:30:15.360
 we can measure their direction, those kinds of things. And, you know, how that all works out.

1:30:15.360 --> 1:30:21.360
 And, you know, in the current models of physics, you know, it's been hard to explain how the

1:30:21.360 --> 1:30:26.240
 universe manages to be as uniform as it is. And that's led to this inflation idea that,

1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:32.560
 to the great annoyance of my then collaborator, we figured out in like 1979, we had this

1:30:32.560 --> 1:30:36.880
 realization that you could get something like this. But it seemed implausible that that's the

1:30:36.880 --> 1:30:43.280
 way the universe worked. So we put it in a footnote. But in any case, I've never really

1:30:43.280 --> 1:30:48.880
 completely believed it. But that's an idea for how to sort of puff out the universe faster than the

1:30:48.880 --> 1:30:54.480
 speed of light, early moments of the universe. That's the sort of the inflation idea and that

1:30:54.480 --> 1:31:01.600
 you can somehow explain how the universe manages to be as uniform as it is. In our model, this turns

1:31:01.600 --> 1:31:07.040
 out to be much more natural because the universe just starts very connected. The hypergraph is not

1:31:07.040 --> 1:31:12.320
 such that the ball that you grow starting from a single point has volume R cubed, it might have

1:31:12.320 --> 1:31:19.600
 volume R to the 500 or R to the infinity. And so that means that you sort of naturally get this

1:31:19.600 --> 1:31:23.680
 much higher degree of connectivity and uniformity in the universe. And then the question is,

1:31:24.400 --> 1:31:29.040
 this is sort of the mathematical physics challenge, is in the standard theory of the universe,

1:31:29.040 --> 1:31:33.360
 there's the Friedman Robertson Walker universe, which is the kind of standard model where the

1:31:33.360 --> 1:31:38.560
 universe is isotropic and homogeneous. And you can then work out the equations of general relativity,

1:31:38.560 --> 1:31:42.640
 and you can figure out how the universe expands. We would like to do the same kind of thing,

1:31:42.640 --> 1:31:47.280
 including dimension change. This is just difficult mathematical physics. I mean,

1:31:47.280 --> 1:31:51.360
 the reason it's difficult is the sort of fundamental reason it's difficult. When

1:31:51.360 --> 1:31:58.240
 people invented calculus 300 years ago, calculus was a story of understanding change and change

1:31:58.240 --> 1:32:03.120
 as a function of a variable. So people study univariate calculus, they study multivariate

1:32:03.120 --> 1:32:08.320
 calculus, it's one variable, it's two variables, three variables. But whoever studied, you know,

1:32:08.320 --> 1:32:16.320
 2.5 variable calculus, turns out nobody. Turns out that what we need to have to understand these

1:32:16.320 --> 1:32:23.280
 fractional dimensional spaces, which don't work like well, they're spaces where the effective

1:32:23.280 --> 1:32:30.080
 dimension is not an integer. So you can't apply the tools of calculus naturally and easily to

1:32:30.080 --> 1:32:34.480
 fractional dimensions? No. So somebody has to figure out how to do that. Yeah,

1:32:34.480 --> 1:32:39.120
 we're trying to figure this out. I mean, it's very interesting. I mean, it's very connected to

1:32:39.120 --> 1:32:44.560
 very frontier issues in mathematics. It's very beautiful. So is it possible? Is it possible?

1:32:44.560 --> 1:32:51.040
 We're dealing with a scale that's so, so much smaller than our human scale. Is it possible

1:32:51.040 --> 1:32:57.280
 to make predictions versus explanations? Do you have a hope that with this hypergraph model,

1:32:57.280 --> 1:33:04.160
 you'd be able to make predictions that then could be validated with a physics experiment,

1:33:04.160 --> 1:33:08.480
 predictions that couldn't have been done or weren't done otherwise? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean,

1:33:08.480 --> 1:33:12.800
 you know, I think which, in which domain do you think? Okay, so they're going to be cosmology ones

1:33:12.800 --> 1:33:16.720
 to do with dimension fluctuations in the universe. That's a very bizarre effect. Nobody, you know,

1:33:16.720 --> 1:33:20.560
 dimension fluctuations is just something nobody ever looked for that. If anybody sees dimension

1:33:20.560 --> 1:33:27.760
 fluctuation, that's a huge flag that something like our model is going on. And how one detects

1:33:27.760 --> 1:33:32.240
 that, you know, that's a problem of kind of, you know, that's a problem of traditional physics in

1:33:32.240 --> 1:33:37.600
 a sense of what's the best way to actually figure that out. And for example, that's one,

1:33:37.600 --> 1:33:44.400
 there are all kinds of things one could imagine. I mean, there are things that in black hole mergers,

1:33:44.400 --> 1:33:50.720
 it's possible that there will be effects of maximum entanglement speed in large black hole mergers.

1:33:50.720 --> 1:33:55.680
 That's another possible thing. And all of that is detected through like what? Do you have a

1:33:55.680 --> 1:34:01.040
 hope for LIGO type of situation? Like that's gravitational waves? Yeah. Or alternatively,

1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:07.600
 I mean, I think it's, you know, look, figuring out experiments is like figuring out technology

1:34:07.600 --> 1:34:12.640
 inventions. That is, you know, you've got a set of raw materials, you've got an underlying model,

1:34:12.640 --> 1:34:16.800
 and now you've got to be very clever to figure out, you know, what is that thing I can measure

1:34:16.800 --> 1:34:23.280
 that just somehow, you know, leverages into the right place. And we've spent less effort on that

1:34:23.280 --> 1:34:30.320
 than I would have liked. Because one of the reasons is that I think that the physicists

1:34:30.320 --> 1:34:35.360
 who've been working on our models, with now lots of physicists actually, it's very, very nice. It's

1:34:35.360 --> 1:34:41.600
 kind of, it's one of these cases where I'm almost, I'm really kind of pleasantly surprised that the

1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:47.760
 sort of absorption of the things we've done has been quite rapid and quite sort of, you know,

1:34:47.760 --> 1:34:53.200
 very positive. So it's a Cambrian explosion of physicists too, not just ideas. Yes. I mean,

1:34:53.200 --> 1:34:57.920
 you know, a lot of what's happened that's really interesting, and again, not what I expected,

1:34:57.920 --> 1:35:04.160
 is there are a lot of areas of sort of very elaborate, sophisticated mathematical physics,

1:35:04.160 --> 1:35:08.880
 whether that's causal set theory, whether it's higher category theory, whether it's categorical

1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:13.600
 quantum mechanics, all sorts of elaborate names for these things, spin networks, perhaps,

1:35:14.880 --> 1:35:20.160
 you know, causal dynamical triangulations, all kinds of names of these fields. And these fields

1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:24.640
 have a bunch of good mathematical physicists in them who've been working for decades in these

1:35:24.640 --> 1:35:30.640
 particular areas. And the question is, but they've been building these mathematical structures.

1:35:30.640 --> 1:35:34.960
 And the mathematical structures are interesting, but they don't typically sit on anything.

1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:39.920
 They're just mathematical structures. And I think what's happened is our models provide kind of

1:35:39.920 --> 1:35:46.800
 a machine code that lives underneath those models. So a typical example, this is due to

1:35:46.800 --> 1:35:52.960
 Jonathan Gorod, who's one of the key people who's been working on our project. This is in,

1:35:52.960 --> 1:35:56.480
 okay, so I'll give you an example just to give a sense of how these things connect. This is in

1:35:56.480 --> 1:36:03.520
 causal set theory. So the idea of causal set theory is there are, in spacetime, we imagine

1:36:03.520 --> 1:36:09.040
 that there's space and time. It's a three plus one dimensional, you know, setup. We imagine that

1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:16.160
 there are just events that happen at different times and places in space and time. And the idea

1:36:16.160 --> 1:36:20.400
 of causal set theory is the only thing you say about the universe is there are a bunch of events

1:36:20.400 --> 1:36:25.520
 that happen sort of randomly at different places in space and time. And then the whole sort of

1:36:25.520 --> 1:36:32.080
 theory of physics has to be to do with this graph of causal relationships between these randomly

1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:37.920
 thrown down events. So they've always been confused by the fact that to get even Lorentz

1:36:37.920 --> 1:36:42.880
 invariants, even relativistic invariants, you need a very special way to throw down those events.

1:36:42.880 --> 1:36:48.080
 And they've had no natural way to understand how that would happen. So what Jonathan figured out

1:36:48.080 --> 1:36:56.000
 is that, in fact, from our models, instead of just generating events at random, our models

1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:02.160
 necessarily generate events in some pattern in spacetime effectively that then leads to Lorentz

1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:06.080
 invariants and relativistic invariants and all those kinds of things. So it's a place where

1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:10.240
 all the mathematics that's been done on, well, we just have a random collection of events.

1:37:10.240 --> 1:37:16.000
 Now what consequences does that have in terms of causal set theory and so on? That can all be kind

1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:22.000
 of wheeled in now that we have some different underlying foundational idea for what the

1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:25.840
 particular distribution of events is as opposed to just what we throw down random events.

1:37:26.400 --> 1:37:32.160
 And so that's a typical sort of example of what we're seeing in all these different areas of kind

1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:36.480
 of how you can take really interesting things that have been done in mathematical physics

1:37:36.480 --> 1:37:43.440
 and connect them. And it's really kind of beautiful because the abstract models we have

1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:48.560
 just seem to plug into all these different very interesting, very elegant abstract ideas.

1:37:48.560 --> 1:37:54.960
 But we're now giving sort of a reason for that to be the way, a reason for one to care. I mean,

1:37:54.960 --> 1:38:01.680
 it's like saying you can think about computation abstractly. You can think about, I don't know,

1:38:01.680 --> 1:38:06.640
 combinators or something as abstract computational things. And you can sort of do all kinds of study

1:38:06.640 --> 1:38:11.040
 of them. But it's like, why do we care? Well, okay, Turing machines are a good start because

1:38:11.040 --> 1:38:14.880
 you can kind of see they're sort of mechanically doing things. But when we actually start thinking

1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:19.920
 about computers, computing things, we have a really good reason to care. And this is sort of

1:38:19.920 --> 1:38:24.640
 what we're providing, I think, is a reason to care about a lot of these areas of mathematical

1:38:24.640 --> 1:38:29.760
 physics. So that's been very nice. So I'm not sure we've ever got to the

1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:36.640
 question of why does the universe exist at all? No, no, let's talk about that. So it's not the

1:38:36.640 --> 1:38:42.960
 simplest question in the world. So it takes a few steps to get to it. And it's nevertheless even

1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:46.800
 surprising that you can even begin to answer this question, as you were saying.

1:38:46.800 --> 1:38:54.400
 Indeed. I'm very surprised. So the next thing to perhaps understand is this idea of ruleal space.

1:38:55.040 --> 1:39:00.240
 So we've got kind of physical space. We've got branchial space, the space of possible quantum

1:39:00.240 --> 1:39:05.840
 histories. And now we've got another level of kind of abstraction, which is ruleal space. And

1:39:05.840 --> 1:39:12.400
 here's where that comes from. So you say, okay, you say we've got this model for the universe.

1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:19.600
 We've got a particular rule. And we run this rule and we get the universe. So that's interesting.

1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:25.200
 Why that rule? Why not another rule? And so that confused me for a long time. And I realized,

1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:31.520
 well, actually, what if the thing could be using all possible rules? What if at every step,

1:39:31.520 --> 1:39:37.600
 in addition to saying apply a particular rule at all places in this hypergraph, one could say,

1:39:37.600 --> 1:39:41.840
 just take all possible rules and apply all possible rules at all possible places in this

1:39:41.840 --> 1:39:48.240
 hypergraph. And then you make this ruleal multiway graph, which both is all possible

1:39:48.240 --> 1:39:53.120
 histories for a particular rule and all possible rules. So the next thing you'd say is, how can you

1:39:53.120 --> 1:39:58.720
 get anything reasonable out of it? How can anything real come out of the set of all possible

1:39:58.720 --> 1:40:04.400
 rules applied in all possible ways? This is a subtle thing, which I haven't fully untangled.

1:40:05.520 --> 1:40:11.440
 There is this object, which is the result of running all possible rules in all possible ways.

1:40:11.440 --> 1:40:15.040
 And you might say, if you're running all possible rules, why can't everything possible happen?

1:40:15.680 --> 1:40:21.840
 Well, the answer is because when you, there's sort of this entanglement that occurs.

1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:27.280
 So let's say that you have a lot of different possible initial conditions, a lot of different

1:40:27.280 --> 1:40:32.800
 possible states. Then you're applying these different rules. Well, some of those rules can

1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:37.200
 end up with the same state. So it isn't the case that you can just get from anywhere to anywhere.

1:40:37.200 --> 1:40:42.080
 There's this whole entangled structure of what can lead to what, and there's a definite structure

1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:48.880
 that's produced. I think I'm going to call that definite structure the rulead, the limit of kind

1:40:48.880 --> 1:40:53.840
 of all possible rules being applied in all possible ways. And you're saying that structure is finite,

1:40:54.480 --> 1:40:59.440
 so that somehow connects to maybe a similar kind of thing as like causal invariance.

1:40:59.440 --> 1:41:03.600
 Well, it happens that the rulead necessarily has causal invariance. That's a feature of,

1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:08.080
 that's just a mathematical consequence of essentially using all possible rules

1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:14.720
 plus universal computation gives you the fact that from any diverging paths, the paths will

1:41:14.720 --> 1:41:20.960
 always converge. But does that necessarily infer that the rulead is finite?

1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:28.240
 In the end, it's not necessarily finite. I mean, just like the history of the universe may not be

1:41:28.240 --> 1:41:32.240
 finite. The history of the universe, time may keep going forever. You can keep running the

1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:37.600
 computations of the rulead and you'll keep spewing out more and more and more structure. It's like

1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:45.520
 time doesn't have to end. But the issue is there are three limits that happen in this rulead

1:41:45.520 --> 1:41:51.280
 object. One is how long you run the computation for. Another is how many different rules you're

1:41:51.280 --> 1:41:56.800
 applying. And another is how many different states you start from. And the mixture of those

1:41:56.800 --> 1:42:02.720
 three limits. I mean, this is just mathematically a horrendous object. And what's interesting about

1:42:02.720 --> 1:42:07.440
 this object is the one thing that does seem to be the case about this object is it connects with

1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:12.800
 ideas in higher category theory. And in particular, it connects to some of the 20th century's most

1:42:12.800 --> 1:42:18.480
 abstract mathematics done by this chap Grothendieck. Grothendieck had a thing called the infinity

1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:24.960
 groupoid, which is closely related to this rulead object. Although the details of the relationship,

1:42:24.960 --> 1:42:31.120
 you know, I don't fully understand yet. But I think that what's interesting is this thing that

1:42:31.120 --> 1:42:37.360
 is sort of this very limiting object. So, okay, so a way to think about this that, again, will

1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:41.520
 take us into another direction, which is the equivalence between physics and mathematics.

1:42:42.400 --> 1:42:50.320
 The way that, well, let's see, maybe this is just to give a sense of this kind of groupoid and

1:42:50.320 --> 1:42:55.120
 things like that. You can think about, in mathematics, you can think you have certain axioms,

1:42:55.120 --> 1:43:01.280
 they're kind of like atoms, and you, well, actually, let's say, let's talk about mathematics

1:43:01.280 --> 1:43:06.960
 for a second. So what is mathematics? What is it made of, so to speak? Mathematics, there's a bunch

1:43:06.960 --> 1:43:13.680
 of statements, like, for addition, x plus y is equal to y plus x, that's a statement in mathematics.

1:43:13.680 --> 1:43:18.240
 Another statement would be, you know, x squared minus one is equal to x plus one, x minus one.

1:43:18.240 --> 1:43:21.840
 There are an infinite number of these possible statements of mathematics.

1:43:21.840 --> 1:43:25.520
 Well, it's not, I mean, it's not just, I guess, a statement, but with x plus y,

1:43:25.520 --> 1:43:29.920
 it's a rule that you can, I mean, you think of it as a rule.

1:43:29.920 --> 1:43:35.760
 It is a rule. It's also just a thing that is true in mathematics.

1:43:35.760 --> 1:43:37.680
 Right. The statement of truth, okay.

1:43:37.680 --> 1:43:44.000
 Right. And what you can imagine is, you imagine just laying out this giant kind of ocean

1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:49.680
 of all statements. Well, actually, you first start, okay, this is where this was segueing

1:43:49.680 --> 1:43:52.240
 into a different thing. Let me not go in this direction for a second.

1:43:52.240 --> 1:43:54.320
 Let's not go to metamathematics just yet.

1:43:54.320 --> 1:44:00.640
 Yeah, we'll maybe get to metamathematics, but it's, so let me not, let me explain the groupoid

1:44:00.640 --> 1:44:07.040
 and things later. But, so let's come back to the universe, always a good place to be in,

1:44:07.040 --> 1:44:07.440
 so to speak.

1:44:07.440 --> 1:44:11.200
 Yeah, so what does the universe have to do with the rule add, the rule of L space,

1:44:11.200 --> 1:44:17.920
 and how that's possibly connected to why the thing exists at all, and why there's just

1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:18.720
 one of them?

1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:24.160
 Yes. Okay. So here's the point. So the thing that had confused me for a long time was,

1:44:24.160 --> 1:44:28.320
 let's say we get the rule for the universe. We hold it in our hand. We say, this is our

1:44:28.320 --> 1:44:33.200
 universe. Then the immediate question is, well, why isn't it another one? And that's

1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:39.920
 kind of the sort of the lesson of Copernicus is, we're not very special. So how come we

1:44:39.920 --> 1:44:46.000
 got universe number 312 and not universe quadrillion, quadrillion, quadrillion? And

1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:52.720
 I think the resolution of that is the realization that the universe is running all possible

1:44:52.720 --> 1:44:58.880
 rules. So then you say, well, how on earth do we perceive the universe to be running

1:44:58.880 --> 1:45:02.640
 according to a particular rule? How do we perceive definite things happening in the

1:45:02.640 --> 1:45:08.560
 universe? Well, it's the same story. It's the observer, there is a reference frame that

1:45:08.560 --> 1:45:14.000
 we are picking in this ruleal space, and that that is what determines our perception of

1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:18.960
 the universe. With our particular sensory information and so on, we are parsing the

1:45:18.960 --> 1:45:24.800
 universe in this particular way. So here's the way to think about it. In physical space,

1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:29.360
 we live in a particular place in the universe. And we could live on Alpha Centauri, but we

1:45:29.360 --> 1:45:36.560
 don't. We live here. And similarly, in ruleal space, we could live in many different places

1:45:36.560 --> 1:45:41.040
 in ruleal space, but we happen to live here. And what does it mean to live here? It means

1:45:41.040 --> 1:45:47.040
 we have certain sensory input. We have certain ways to parse the universe. Those are our

1:45:47.040 --> 1:45:51.680
 interpretation of the universe. What would it mean to travel in ruleal space? What it

1:45:51.680 --> 1:45:56.080
 basically means is that we are successively interpreting the universe in different ways.

1:45:56.080 --> 1:46:01.520
 So in other words, to be at a different point in ruleal space is to have a different, in a sense,

1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:06.240
 a different interpretation of what's going on in the universe. And we can imagine even

1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:10.880
 things like an analog of the speed of light as the maximum speed of translation in ruleal

1:46:10.880 --> 1:46:18.320
 space and so on. So wait, what's the interpretation? So ruleal space and we,

1:46:18.320 --> 1:46:23.920
 I'm confused by the we and the interpretation and the universe. I thought moving about in

1:46:23.920 --> 1:46:33.680
 ruleal space changes the way the universe is. The way we would perceive it. So it ultimately

1:46:33.680 --> 1:46:40.880
 has to do with the perception. So it doesn't real, ruleal space is not somehow changing,

1:46:41.600 --> 1:46:47.840
 like branching into another universe or something like that. No, I mean, the point is that the whole

1:46:47.840 --> 1:46:54.800
 point of this is the rule yard is sort of the encapsulated version of everything that is the

1:46:54.800 --> 1:47:00.320
 universe running according to all possible rules. We think of our universe, the observable universe,

1:47:00.320 --> 1:47:07.600
 as a thing. So we're a little bit loose with the word universe then, because wouldn't the rule yard

1:47:07.600 --> 1:47:14.320
 potentially encapsulate a very large number, like combinatorially large, maybe infinite

1:47:14.720 --> 1:47:20.960
 set of what we human physicists think of as universes? That's an interesting, interesting

1:47:20.960 --> 1:47:25.920
 parsing of the word universe, right? Because what we're saying is, just as we're at a particular

1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:30.720
 place in physical space, we're at a particular place in ruleal space, at that particular place

1:47:30.720 --> 1:47:35.280
 in ruleal space, our experience of the universe is this. Just as if we lived at the center of the

1:47:35.280 --> 1:47:39.120
 galaxy, our universe, our experience of the universe will be different from the one it is,

1:47:39.120 --> 1:47:47.120
 given where we actually live. And so what we're saying is, you might say, I mean, in a sense,

1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:52.800
 this rule yard is sort of a super universe, so to speak. But it's all entangled together. It's not

1:47:52.800 --> 1:47:58.720
 like you can separate out. You can say, let me, it's like when we take a reference, okay, it's like

1:47:58.720 --> 1:48:03.520
 our experience of the universe is based on where we are in the universe. We could imagine moving

1:48:03.520 --> 1:48:05.840
 to somewhere else in the universe, but it's still the same universe.

1:48:05.840 --> 1:48:10.800
 So there's not like universes existing in parallel?

1:48:10.800 --> 1:48:18.240
 No. Because, and the whole point is that if we were able to change our interpretation of what's

1:48:18.240 --> 1:48:24.000
 going on, we could perceive a different reference frame in this rule yard.

1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:31.040
 Yeah, but that's not, that's just, yeah, that's the same rule yard. That's the same universe.

1:48:31.040 --> 1:48:34.480
 You're just moving about. These are just coordinates in the universe.

1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:39.680
 Right. So the reason that's interesting is, imagine the extraterrestrial intelligence,

1:48:39.680 --> 1:48:46.080
 so the alien intelligence, we should say. The alien intelligence might live on Alpha Centauri,

1:48:46.080 --> 1:48:48.880
 but it might also live at a different place in real space.

1:48:48.880 --> 1:48:52.560
 It can live right here on Earth. It just has a different reference frame that

1:48:52.560 --> 1:48:57.840
 includes a very different perception of the universe. And then because that

1:48:57.840 --> 1:49:01.760
 real space is very large, I mean,

1:49:01.760 --> 1:49:04.640
 Do we get to communicate with them? Right.

1:49:04.640 --> 1:49:13.360
 Yeah, but it's also, well, one thing is how different the perception of the universe could be.

1:49:13.360 --> 1:49:19.360
 I think it could be bizarrely, unimaginably completely different. And I mean, one thing to

1:49:19.360 --> 1:49:25.600
 realize is, even in kind of things I don't understand well, you know, I know about the kind

1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:30.240
 of Western tradition of understanding, you know, science and all that kind of thing. And, you know,

1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:36.880
 you talk to people who say, well, I, you know, I'm really into some, you know, Eastern tradition of

1:49:36.880 --> 1:49:41.760
 this, that and the other. And it's really obvious to me how things work. I don't understand it

1:49:41.760 --> 1:49:47.280
 at all. But, you know, it is not obvious, I think, with this kind of realization that there's these

1:49:47.280 --> 1:49:52.560
 very different ways to interpret what's going on in the universe. That kind of gives me at least,

1:49:52.560 --> 1:49:57.120
 it doesn't help me to understand that different interpretation. But it gives me at least more

1:49:57.120 --> 1:49:59.920
 respect for the possibility that there will be other interpretations.

1:49:59.920 --> 1:50:06.000
 Yeah, it humbles you to the possibility that like, what is it, reincarnation or all these like

1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:12.000
 eternal recurrence with Nietzsche, like just these ideas? Yeah.

1:50:12.640 --> 1:50:15.840
 Well, you know, the thing that I realized about a bunch of those things is that, you know,

1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:20.160
 I've been sort of doing my little survey of the history of philosophy, just trying to understand,

1:50:20.160 --> 1:50:24.480
 you know, what can I actually say now about some of these things? And you realize that some of

1:50:24.480 --> 1:50:29.920
 these concepts like the immortal soul concept, which, you know, I remember when I was a kid,

1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:35.360
 and, you know, it was kind of a lots of religion bashing type stuff of people saying, you know,

1:50:35.360 --> 1:50:41.760
 well, we know about physics, tell us how much does a soul weigh? And people are like, well,

1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:46.400
 how can it be a thing if it doesn't weigh anything? Well, now we understand, you know,

1:50:46.400 --> 1:50:50.800
 there is this notion of what's in brains that isn't the matter of brains, and it's something

1:50:50.800 --> 1:50:56.320
 computational. And there is a sense and in fact, it is correct, that it is in some sense, immortal,

1:50:56.320 --> 1:51:01.440
 because this pattern of computation is something abstract that is not specific to the particular

1:51:01.440 --> 1:51:07.360
 material of a brain. Now, we don't know how to extract it, you know, in our traditional scientific

1:51:07.360 --> 1:51:13.440
 approach. But it's still something where it isn't a crazy thing to say there is something doesn't

1:51:13.440 --> 1:51:19.120
 weigh anything. That's a kind of a silly question. How much does it weigh? Well, actually, maybe it

1:51:19.120 --> 1:51:24.160
 isn't such a silly question in our model of physics, because the actual computational activity

1:51:24.160 --> 1:51:27.520
 has has a consequence for gravity and things, but that's a very subtle.

1:51:27.520 --> 1:51:33.680
 You can talk about mass and energy and so on. That could be a, what would you call it, a solitron.

1:51:35.040 --> 1:51:36.160
 Yes, yes, yes.

1:51:36.160 --> 1:51:39.520
 A particle that somehow contains soulness.

1:51:39.520 --> 1:51:43.680
 Yeah, right. Well, that's what, by the way, that's what Leibniz said. And, you know,

1:51:43.680 --> 1:51:48.320
 one thing I've never understood this, you know, Leibniz had this idea of monads and monadology,

1:51:48.320 --> 1:51:53.040
 and he had this idea that what exists in the universe is this big collection of monads.

1:51:53.040 --> 1:51:57.520
 And that they that the only thing that one knows about the monads is sort of how they relate to

1:51:57.520 --> 1:52:02.880
 each other. It sounds awfully like hypergraphs, right? But Leibniz had really lost me at the

1:52:02.880 --> 1:52:08.400
 following thing. He said, each of these monads has a soul, and each of them has a consciousness.

1:52:09.040 --> 1:52:12.480
 And it's like, okay, I'm out of here. I don't understand this at all. I don't know what's

1:52:12.480 --> 1:52:19.360
 going on. But I realized recently that in his day, the concept that a thing could do something

1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:23.200
 could spontaneously do something. That was his only way of describing that.

1:52:23.760 --> 1:52:29.120
 And so what I would now say is, well, there's this abstract rule that runs. To Leibniz,

1:52:29.120 --> 1:52:33.440
 that would have been, you know, in 1690 or whatever, that would have been kind of,

1:52:33.440 --> 1:52:38.640
 well, it has a soul, it has a consciousness. And so, you know, in a sense, it's like one

1:52:38.640 --> 1:52:43.760
 of these, there's no new idea under the sun, so to speak. That's a sort of a version of the same

1:52:43.760 --> 1:52:48.880
 kinds of ideas, but couched in terms that are sort of bizarrely different from the ones that

1:52:48.880 --> 1:52:54.320
 we would use today. Would you be able to maybe play devil's advocate on your conception of

1:52:54.320 --> 1:52:59.360
 consciousness that, like the two characteristics of it that is constrained, and there's a

1:52:59.920 --> 1:53:07.600
 single thread of time? Is it possible that Leibniz was onto something that the basic atom,

1:53:07.600 --> 1:53:14.960
 the discrete atom of space has a consciousness? Is that, so these are just words, right? But like,

1:53:14.960 --> 1:53:19.440
 what is there? Is there some sense where consciousness is much more fundamental

1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:24.000
 than you're making it seem? I don't know. I mean, you know, I think...

1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:26.720
 Can you construct a world in which it is much more fundamental?

1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:32.720
 I think that, okay, so the question would be, is there a way to think about kind of,

1:53:33.440 --> 1:53:38.560
 if we sort of parse the universe down at the level of atoms of space or something,

1:53:38.560 --> 1:53:42.080
 could we say, well, so that's really a question of a different point of view,

1:53:42.080 --> 1:53:47.200
 a different place in real space. We're asking the question, could there be a civilization

1:53:47.200 --> 1:53:54.080
 that exists? Could there be sort of conscious entities that exist at the level of atoms of

1:53:54.080 --> 1:53:57.840
 space? And what would that be like? And I think that comes back to this question of,

1:53:58.400 --> 1:54:05.920
 what's it like to be a cellular automaton type thing? I mean, I'm not yet there. I don't know.

1:54:05.920 --> 1:54:12.800
 I mean, I think that this is a... And I know I don't even know yet quite how to think about this

1:54:12.800 --> 1:54:17.520
 in the sense that I was considering, you know, I never write fiction, but I haven't written it

1:54:17.520 --> 1:54:22.160
 since I was like 10 years old. And my fiction, I made one attempt, which I sent to some science

1:54:22.160 --> 1:54:25.280
 fiction writer friends of mine, and they told me it was terrible. So, but...

1:54:25.280 --> 1:54:26.720
 This is a long time ago?

1:54:26.720 --> 1:54:27.920
 No, this is recently.

1:54:27.920 --> 1:54:31.920
 Recently. They said it was terrible. That'd be interesting to see you write a short story

1:54:31.920 --> 1:54:38.080
 based on what sounds like it's already inspiring short stories or stories by science fiction

1:54:38.080 --> 1:54:38.800
 writers.

1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:45.040
 But I think the interesting thing for me is, you know, what is it like to be a whatever?

1:54:45.680 --> 1:54:49.520
 How do you describe that? I mean, that's not a thing that you describe in mathematics,

1:54:49.520 --> 1:54:51.760
 the what is it like to be such and such.

1:54:51.760 --> 1:54:55.600
 Well, see, to me, when you say what is it like to be something,

1:54:55.600 --> 1:55:06.720
 it presumes that you're talking about a singular entity. So, like, there's some kind of feeling of

1:55:07.520 --> 1:55:12.160
 the entity, the stuff that's inside of it and the stuff that's outside of it.

1:55:12.800 --> 1:55:20.080
 And then that's when consciousness starts making sense. But then it seems like that could be

1:55:20.080 --> 1:55:26.880
 generalizable. If you take some subset of a cellular automata, you could start talking

1:55:26.880 --> 1:55:33.360
 about what does that subset feel. But then you can, I think you could just take arbitrary

1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:41.760
 numbers of subsets. Like, to me, like, you and I individually are consciousnesses,

1:55:41.760 --> 1:55:45.680
 but you could also say the two of us together is a singular consciousness.

1:55:45.680 --> 1:55:49.840
 Maybe, maybe. I'm not so sure about that. I think that the single thread of time thing

1:55:49.840 --> 1:55:54.800
 may be pretty important. And that as soon as you start saying, there are two different threads

1:55:54.800 --> 1:55:59.280
 of time, there are two different experiences, and then we have to say, how do they relate?

1:55:59.280 --> 1:56:03.520
 How are they sort of entangled with each other? I mean, that may be a different story of a thing

1:56:03.520 --> 1:56:08.960
 that isn't much like, you know, what do the ants, you know, what's it like to be an ant,

1:56:08.960 --> 1:56:12.880
 you know, where there's a sort of more collective view of the world, so to speak?

1:56:12.880 --> 1:56:20.800
 I don't know. I think that, I mean, this is, you know, I don't really have a good, I mean,

1:56:20.800 --> 1:56:26.240
 you know, my best thought is, you know, can we turn it into a human story? It's like the question

1:56:26.240 --> 1:56:30.480
 of, you know, when we try and understand physics, can we turn that into something which is sort of

1:56:30.480 --> 1:56:36.160
 a human understandable narrative? And now what's it like to be a such and such? You know, maybe the

1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:41.040
 only medium in which we can describe that is something like fiction, where it's kind of like

1:56:41.040 --> 1:56:48.720
 you're telling, you know, the life story in that setting. But I'm, this is beyond what I've yet

1:56:48.720 --> 1:56:53.280
 understood how to do. Yeah, but it does seem so, like with human consciousness, you know,

1:56:53.280 --> 1:57:01.120
 we're made up of cells and like, there's a bunch of systems that are networked that work together

1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:07.920
 that at this, at the human level, feel like a singular consciousness when you take, and so

1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:14.400
 maybe like an ant colony is just too low level. Sorry, an ant is too low level. Maybe you have to

1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:20.320
 look at the ant colony. Yeah, I agree. There's some level at which it's a conscious being. And then

1:57:20.320 --> 1:57:26.080
 if you go to the planetary scale, then maybe that's going too far. So there's a nice sweet spot for

1:57:26.080 --> 1:57:33.920
 consciousness. No, I agree. I think the difficulty is that, you know, okay, so in sort of people who

1:57:33.920 --> 1:57:38.400
 talk about consciousness, one of the terrible things I've realized, because I've now interacted

1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:44.240
 with some of this community, so to speak, some interesting people who do that kind of thinking.

1:57:44.240 --> 1:57:48.400
 But, you know, one of the things I was saying to one of the leading people in that area, I was

1:57:48.400 --> 1:57:55.200
 saying, you know, that, you know, it must be kind of frustrating because it's kind of like a poetry

1:57:55.200 --> 1:57:59.840
 story. That is many people are writing poems, but few people are reading them. So there are always

1:57:59.840 --> 1:58:04.720
 these different, you know, everybody has their own theory of consciousness, and they are very

1:58:04.720 --> 1:58:11.760
 non inter sort of inter discussable. And by the way, I mean, you know, my own approach to sort of

1:58:11.760 --> 1:58:16.560
 the question of consciousness, as far as I'm concerned, I'm an applied consciousness operative,

1:58:16.560 --> 1:58:21.760
 so to speak, because I don't really, in a sense, the thing I'm trying to get out of it is how does

1:58:21.760 --> 1:58:27.600
 it help me to understand what's a possible theory of physics? And how does it help me to say,

1:58:27.600 --> 1:58:34.000
 how do I go from this incoherent collection of things happening in the universe to our definite

1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:38.880
 perception and definite laws and so on, and sort of an applied version of consciousness? And I

1:58:38.880 --> 1:58:44.000
 think the reason it sort of segues to a different kind of topic, but the reason that one of the

1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:48.480
 things I'm particularly interested in is kind of what's the analog of consciousness in systems

1:58:48.480 --> 1:58:54.640
 very different from brains? And so why is that matter? Well, you know, this whole description

1:58:54.640 --> 1:59:00.400
 of this kind of, you know what, we haven't talked about why the universe exists. So let's get to why

1:59:00.400 --> 1:59:06.800
 the universe exists. And then we can talk about perhaps a little bit about what these models of

1:59:06.800 --> 1:59:12.000
 physics kind of show you about other kinds of things like molecular computing and so on.

1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:13.200
 Yes, that's good.

1:59:13.200 --> 1:59:17.120
 Why does the universe exist? Okay, so we finally sort of more or less set the stage,

1:59:17.120 --> 1:59:22.080
 we've got this idea of this rule yard of this object that is made from following all possible

1:59:22.080 --> 1:59:27.600
 rules, the fact that it's sort of not just this incoherent mess, it's got all this entangled

1:59:27.600 --> 1:59:35.600
 structure in it, and so on. Okay, so what is this rule yard? Well, it is the working out of all

1:59:35.600 --> 1:59:41.200
 possible formal systems. So the sort of the question of why does the universe exist? Its

1:59:41.200 --> 1:59:46.240
 core question, which we kind of started with is, you've got two plus two equals four, you've got

1:59:46.240 --> 1:59:52.560
 some other abstract result, but that's not actualized. It's just an abstract thing.

1:59:52.560 --> 1:59:56.160
 And when we say we've got a model for the universe, okay, it's this rule, you run it,

1:59:56.160 --> 2:00:03.440
 and it'll make the universe, but it's like, but where's it actually running? What is it actually

2:00:03.440 --> 2:00:11.760
 doing? Is it actual, or is it merely a formal description of something? So the thing to realize

2:00:11.760 --> 2:00:19.760
 with this, the thing about the rule yard is it's an inevitable, it is the entangled running of all

2:00:19.760 --> 2:00:25.280
 possible rules. So you don't get to say, it's not like you're saying, which rule yard are you

2:00:25.280 --> 2:00:32.560
 picking? Because it's all possible formal rules. It's not like it's just, well, actually, it's

2:00:32.560 --> 2:00:37.120
 only footnote. The only footnote, it's an important footnote, is it's all possible

2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:45.440
 computational rules, not hyper computational rules. That is, it's running all the rules that would be

2:00:46.400 --> 2:00:51.520
 accessible to a Turing machine, but it is not running all the rules that will be accessible

2:00:51.520 --> 2:00:56.400
 to a thing that can solve problems in finite time that would take a Turing machine infinite time to

2:00:56.400 --> 2:01:01.520
 solve. So you can, even Alan Turing knew this, that you could make oracles for Turing machines,

2:01:01.520 --> 2:01:05.520
 where you say a Turing machine can't solve the whole thing problem for Turing machines. It can't

2:01:05.520 --> 2:01:10.000
 know what will happen in any Turing machine after an infinite time, in any finite time,

2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:15.600
 but you could invent a box, just make a black box. You say, I'm going to sell you an oracle

2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:19.280
 that will just tell you, you know, press this button. It'll tell you what the Turing machine

2:01:19.280 --> 2:01:23.920
 will do after an infinite time. You can imagine such a box. You can't necessarily build one in

2:01:23.920 --> 2:01:29.120
 the physical universe, but you can imagine such a box. And so we could say, well, in addition to,

2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:36.400
 so in this Rulliad, we're imagining that there is a computational, that at the end, it's running

2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:42.880
 rules that are computational. It doesn't have a bunch of oracle black boxes in it. You say, well,

2:01:42.880 --> 2:01:48.800
 why not? Well, it turns out if there are oracle black boxes, the Rulliad that is,

2:01:48.800 --> 2:01:53.040
 you can make a sort of super Rulliad that contains those oracle black boxes,

2:01:53.040 --> 2:01:57.360
 but it has a cosmological event horizon relative to the first one. They can't communicate.

2:01:57.360 --> 2:02:05.360
 In other words, you can end up with, what ends up happening is it's like in the physical universe,

2:02:06.160 --> 2:02:09.920
 in this causal graph that represents the causal relationships of different things,

2:02:09.920 --> 2:02:16.400
 you can have an event horizon where the causal graph is disconnected, where the effect here,

2:02:16.400 --> 2:02:20.720
 an event happening here does not affect an event happening here because there's a disconnection

2:02:20.720 --> 2:02:26.400
 in the causal graph. And that's what happens in an event horizon. And so what will happen between

2:02:26.400 --> 2:02:34.480
 this kind of the ordinary Rulliad and the hyper Rulliad is there is an event horizon and we,

2:02:34.480 --> 2:02:42.880
 in our Rulliad, will just never know that they're just separate things. They're not connected.

2:02:42.880 --> 2:02:46.000
 And maybe I'm not understanding, but just because we can't observe it,

2:02:47.760 --> 2:02:49.200
 why does that mean it doesn't exist?

2:02:49.200 --> 2:02:57.200
 So it might exist, but it's not clear what it... So what, so to speak, whether it exists. What

2:02:57.200 --> 2:03:01.600
 we're trying to understand is why does our universe exist? We're not trying to ask the

2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:10.640
 question what... Let me say another thing. Let me make a meta comment, which is that I have not

2:03:10.640 --> 2:03:18.320
 thought through this hyper Rulliad business properly. So I can't... The hyper Rulliad is

2:03:18.320 --> 2:03:22.640
 referring to a Rulliad in which hyper computation is possible.

2:03:22.640 --> 2:03:23.680
 That's correct. Yes.

2:03:23.680 --> 2:03:33.280
 Okay. So the footnote to the footnote is we're not sure why this is important.

2:03:33.280 --> 2:03:39.120
 Yeah, that's right. So let's ignore that. Okay. It's already abstract enough. Okay. So,

2:03:39.920 --> 2:03:46.800
 okay. So the one question is we have to say, if we're saying, why does the universe exist?

2:03:46.800 --> 2:03:52.480
 One question is why is it this universe and not another universe? Okay. So the important point

2:03:52.480 --> 2:03:59.840
 about this Rulliad idea is that in the Rulliad are all possible formal systems. So there's no

2:03:59.840 --> 2:04:05.360
 choice being made. There's no like, oh, we pick this particular universe and not that one. That's

2:04:05.360 --> 2:04:12.640
 the first thing. The second thing is that we have to ask the question. So you say, why does two plus

2:04:12.640 --> 2:04:20.720
 two equals four exist? That is a thing that necessarily is that way just on the basis of

2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:27.520
 the meaning of the terms, two and plus and equals and so on. So the thing is that this Rulliad

2:04:27.520 --> 2:04:34.560
 object is in a sense a necessary object. It is just the thing that is the consequence of working

2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:40.480
 out the consequence of the formal definition of things. It is not a thing where you're saying,

2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:47.760
 and this is picked as the particular thing. This is just something which necessarily is that thing

2:04:47.760 --> 2:04:53.920
 because of the definition of what it means to have computation. So the Rulliad, it's a formal system.

2:04:54.480 --> 2:05:02.560
 Yes. But does it exist? Ah, well, where are we in this whole thing?

2:05:02.560 --> 2:05:10.560
 Yes. We are part of this Rulliad. So there is no sense to say, does two plus

2:05:10.560 --> 2:05:19.600
 two equals four exist? Well, in some sense, it necessarily exists. It's a necessary object. It's

2:05:19.600 --> 2:05:25.920
 not a thing that way you can ask. Usually in philosophy, there's a sort of distinction made

2:05:25.920 --> 2:05:32.000
 between necessary truths, contingent truths, analytic propositions, synthetic propositions

2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:37.200
 that are a variety of different versions of this. They're things which are necessarily true just

2:05:37.200 --> 2:05:42.240
 based on the definition of terms. And there are things which happen to be true in our universe.

2:05:42.800 --> 2:05:49.840
 But we don't exist in Rullial space. That's one of the coordinates that define our existence.

2:05:51.200 --> 2:05:58.240
 Well, okay. So yes, yes. But this Rulliad is the set of all possible Rullial coordinates.

2:05:58.240 --> 2:06:04.880
 So what we're saying is it contains that. So what we're saying is we exist as, okay, so

2:06:04.880 --> 2:06:09.280
 our perception of what's going on is we're at a particular place in this Rulliad,

2:06:09.280 --> 2:06:12.960
 and we are concluding certain things about how the universe works based on that.

2:06:13.520 --> 2:06:19.760
 But the question is, do we understand, you know, is there something where we say,

2:06:19.760 --> 2:06:27.360
 okay, so why does it work that way? Well, the answer is, I think it has to work that way,

2:06:27.360 --> 2:06:35.360
 because this Rulliad is a necessary object in the sense that it is a purely formal object,

2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:41.600
 just like 2 plus 2 equals 4. It's not an object that was made of something. It's an object that

2:06:41.600 --> 2:06:46.480
 is just an expression of the necessary collection of formal relations that exist.

2:06:46.480 --> 2:06:53.280
 And so then the issue is, can we, in our experience of that, is it, you know, can we have

2:06:53.280 --> 2:07:00.080
 tables and chairs, so to speak, in that just by virtue of our experience of that necessary thing?

2:07:00.720 --> 2:07:06.960
 And, you know, what people have generally thought, and I don't know of a lot of discussion of this,

2:07:06.960 --> 2:07:12.240
 why does the universe exist question? It's been a very, you know, I've been surprised actually at

2:07:12.240 --> 2:07:17.520
 how little, I mean, I think it's one of these things that's really kind of far out there. But

2:07:17.520 --> 2:07:25.840
 the thing that is, you know, the surprise here is that all possible formal rules, when you run them

2:07:25.840 --> 2:07:30.080
 together, and that's the critical thing, when you run them together, they produce this kind of

2:07:30.080 --> 2:07:37.040
 entangled structure that has a definite structure. It's not just, you know, a random arbitrary thing,

2:07:37.040 --> 2:07:42.640
 it's a thing with definite structure. And that structure is the thing when we are embedded in

2:07:42.640 --> 2:07:48.960
 that structure, when anything, you know, an entity embedded in that structure perceives something,

2:07:48.960 --> 2:07:54.240
 which is then we can interpret as physics and things like this. So in other words, we don't

2:07:54.240 --> 2:08:00.080
 have to ask the question, the why does it exist? It necessarily exists.

2:08:00.080 --> 2:08:02.880
 I'm missing this part. Why does it necessarily exist?

2:08:02.880 --> 2:08:03.520
 Okay, okay.

2:08:03.520 --> 2:08:11.600
 So like, you need to have it if you want to formalize the relation between entities, but

2:08:14.160 --> 2:08:15.760
 why do you need to have relations?

2:08:15.760 --> 2:08:22.480
 Okay, okay. So let's say you say, well...

2:08:22.480 --> 2:08:24.800
 It's like, why does math have to exist?

2:08:24.800 --> 2:08:32.880
 Fair question. Okay, fair question. Let's see. I think the thing to think about is

2:08:33.520 --> 2:08:38.640
 the existence of mathematics is something where given a definition of terms,

2:08:40.080 --> 2:08:47.520
 what follows from that definition inevitably follows. So now you can say, why define any terms?

2:08:47.520 --> 2:08:56.240
 But in a sense, the, well, that's okay. So the definition of terms, I mean, I think the way to

2:08:56.240 --> 2:08:58.080
 think about this, let me see.

2:08:58.080 --> 2:09:01.360
 So like concrete terms.

2:09:01.360 --> 2:09:09.280
 Well, they're not very concrete. I mean, they're just things like, you know, logical or.

2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:13.280
 Right, but that's a thing. That's a powerful thing.

2:09:13.280 --> 2:09:20.720
 Well, yes, okay. But the point is that it is not a thing of a, you know, people imagine there is,

2:09:20.720 --> 2:09:28.080
 I don't know, the, you know, an elephant or something or the, you know, elephants are presumably

2:09:28.080 --> 2:09:34.720
 not necessary objects. They happen to exist as a result of kind of biological evolution and

2:09:34.720 --> 2:09:43.360
 whatever else. But the thing is that in some sense that there is, it is a different kind of thing

2:09:43.360 --> 2:09:48.640
 to say, does plus exist? It's not like an elephant.

2:09:48.640 --> 2:09:56.800
 So a plus seems more fundamental, more basic than an elephant. Yes. But you can imagine a world

2:09:56.800 --> 2:10:05.920
 without plus or anything like it. Like, why do formal things that are discrete, that can be used

2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:08.400
 to reason have to exist?

2:10:08.400 --> 2:10:14.960
 Well, okay. So why? Okay. So then the question is, but the whole point is computation.

2:10:14.960 --> 2:10:21.120
 We can certainly imagine computation. That is, we can certainly say there is a formal system that

2:10:21.120 --> 2:10:30.240
 we can construct abstractly in our minds that is computation. And that's the, you know, we can

2:10:30.240 --> 2:10:39.840
 imagine it. Now the question is, is it that formal system, once we exist as observers embedded in

2:10:39.840 --> 2:10:46.720
 that formal system, that's enough to have something which is like our universe. And so then what

2:10:46.720 --> 2:10:53.760
 you're kind of asking is perhaps is why, I mean, the point is we definitely can imagine it.

2:10:53.760 --> 2:11:02.800
 There's nothing that says that we're not saying that it's sort of inevitable that that is a thing

2:11:02.800 --> 2:11:07.760
 that we can imagine. We don't have to ask, does it exist? We're just, it is definitely something

2:11:07.760 --> 2:11:15.200
 we can imagine. Now that's, then we have this thing that is a formally constructible thing

2:11:15.200 --> 2:11:20.640
 that we can imagine. And now we have to ask the question, what, you know, given that formally

2:11:20.640 --> 2:11:28.080
 constructible thing, what is, what consequences does that, if we were to perceive that formally,

2:11:28.080 --> 2:11:33.280
 if we were embedded in that formally constructible thing, what would we perceive about the world?

2:11:33.280 --> 2:11:40.480
 And we would say, we perceive that the world exists because we are seeing all of this mechanism

2:11:40.480 --> 2:11:46.720
 of all these things happening. And, but that's something that is just a feature of, it's something

2:11:46.720 --> 2:11:53.120
 where we are... See, another way of asking this that I'm trying to get at, I understand why it

2:11:53.120 --> 2:12:04.560
 feels like this ruley ad is necessary, but maybe it's just me being human, but it feels like then

2:12:04.560 --> 2:12:11.280
 you should be able to, not us, but somehow step outside of the ruley ad. Like what's outside the

2:12:11.280 --> 2:12:17.600
 ruley ad? Well, the ruley ad is all formal systems. So there's nothing because... But that's what a

2:12:17.600 --> 2:12:22.240
 human would say. I know that's what a human would say, because we're used to the idea that there are,

2:12:22.240 --> 2:12:29.200
 there's, but the whole point is that by the time it's all possible formal systems, it's, it's like,

2:12:29.200 --> 2:12:36.960
 it is all things you can imagine, but... All computations you can imagine, but like we don't...

2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:45.200
 Well, so the issue is, can we encode? Okay. So that's a fair question. Is it possible to encode

2:12:45.200 --> 2:12:52.000
 all, I mean, once we, is there something that isn't what we can represent formally?

2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:57.600
 Right. That is, is there something that, and that's, I think, related to the hyper ruley ad

2:12:57.600 --> 2:13:04.000
 footnote, so to speak, which I'm afraid that the, you know, one of the things sort of interesting

2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:08.880
 about this is, you know, there has been some discussion of this in theology and things like

2:13:08.880 --> 2:13:18.880
 that, but, which I don't necessarily understand all of, but the key sort of new input is this idea

2:13:19.440 --> 2:13:25.280
 that all possible formal systems, it's like, you know, if you make a world, people say, well, you

2:13:25.280 --> 2:13:30.400
 make a world with a particular, in a particular way with particular rules, but no, you don't do

2:13:30.400 --> 2:13:37.520
 that. You can make a world that deals with all possible rules, and then merely by virtue of

2:13:37.520 --> 2:13:42.800
 living in a particular place in that world, so to speak, we have the perception we have of what the

2:13:42.800 --> 2:13:49.360
 world is like. Now, I have to say the, it's sort of interesting because I've, you know, I wrote this

2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:57.520
 piece about this, and I, you know, this philosophy stuff is not super easy, and I've, as I'm talking

2:13:57.520 --> 2:14:00.880
 to you about it, and I actually haven't, you know, people have been interested in lots of different

2:14:00.880 --> 2:14:05.360
 things we've been doing, but this, why does the universe exist, has been, I would say, one of the,

2:14:05.360 --> 2:14:10.720
 one of the ones that you would think people will be most interested in, but actually, I think

2:14:10.720 --> 2:14:17.200
 they're just like, oh, that's just something complicated that, so I haven't, I haven't explained

2:14:17.200 --> 2:14:21.120
 it as much as I've explained a bunch of other things, and I have to say, I think I, I think I

2:14:21.120 --> 2:14:27.520
 may be missing a couple of pieces of that argument that would be, so it's kind of a like…

2:14:27.520 --> 2:14:32.720
 Well, you are, your conscious being is computationally bounded, so you're missing…

2:14:32.720 --> 2:14:33.200
 Indeed.

2:14:33.200 --> 2:14:38.560
 Having written quite a few articles yourself, you're now missing some of the pieces.

2:14:38.560 --> 2:14:39.120
 Yes, right.

2:14:39.120 --> 2:14:40.880
 That's the limitation of being human.

2:14:40.880 --> 2:14:46.960
 Right. One of the consequences of this, why the universe exists thing, is that you're missing

2:14:46.960 --> 2:14:53.840
 something, and this kind of concept of rule adds and, you know, places in there representing our

2:14:53.840 --> 2:14:59.680
 perception of the universe and so on. One of the weird consequences is, if the universe exists,

2:14:59.680 --> 2:15:06.320
 mathematics must also exist. And that's a weird thing, because mathematics, people have been very

2:15:06.320 --> 2:15:14.640
 confused, including me, have been very confused about the question of kind of what, what is the

2:15:14.640 --> 2:15:20.080
 definition of mathematics? What is, what kind of a thing is mathematics? Is mathematics something

2:15:20.080 --> 2:15:25.200
 where we just write down axioms like Euclid did for geometry, and we just build the structure,

2:15:25.200 --> 2:15:28.960
 and we could have written down different axioms, and we'd have a different structure? Or is it

2:15:28.960 --> 2:15:33.280
 something that has a more fundamental sort of truth to it? And I have to say, this is one of

2:15:33.280 --> 2:15:38.320
 these cases where I've long believed that mathematics has a great deal of arbitrariness to

2:15:38.320 --> 2:15:43.360
 it, that there are particular axioms that kind of got written down by the Babylonians, and, you

2:15:43.360 --> 2:15:47.120
 know, that's what we've ended up with the mathematics that we have. And I have to say,

2:15:47.120 --> 2:15:51.600
 actually, my wife has been telling me for 25 years, she was a mathematician, she's been telling me,

2:15:51.600 --> 2:15:57.120
 you're wrong about the foundations of mathematics. And, you know, I'm like, no, no, no, I know what

2:15:57.120 --> 2:16:04.160
 I'm talking about. And finally, she's much more right than I've been. So it's one of the...

2:16:04.160 --> 2:16:11.600
 So, I mean, her sense and your sense, are we just, so this is to the question of metamathematics,

2:16:11.600 --> 2:16:18.080
 just kind of on a trajectory through ruleal space, except in mathematics, through a trajectory of

2:16:18.080 --> 2:16:23.920
 a certain kind of... I think that's partly the idea. So I think that the notion is this. So 100

2:16:23.920 --> 2:16:28.320
 years ago, a little bit more than 100 years ago, people have been doing mathematics for ages,

2:16:28.320 --> 2:16:34.640
 but then in the late 1800s, people decided to try and formalize mathematics and say, you know,

2:16:34.640 --> 2:16:38.720
 it is mathematics is, you know, we're going to break it down, we're going to make it like logic,

2:16:38.720 --> 2:16:43.600
 make it out of sort of fundamental primitives. And that was people like Frager and Piano and

2:16:43.600 --> 2:16:50.160
 Hilbert and so on. And they kind of got this idea of let's do kind of Euclid, but even better,

2:16:50.160 --> 2:16:54.480
 let's just make everything just in terms of this sort of symbolic axioms, and then build

2:16:54.480 --> 2:17:00.880
 up mathematics from that. And that, you know, they thought at the time, as soon as they get

2:17:00.880 --> 2:17:05.280
 these symbolic axioms, that they made the same mistake, the kind of computational irreducibility

2:17:05.280 --> 2:17:10.960
 mistake. They thought as soon as we've written down the axioms, then we'll just have a machine,

2:17:11.520 --> 2:17:16.880
 kind of a super mathematical, so to speak, that can just grind out all true theorems of mathematics.

2:17:17.600 --> 2:17:21.680
 That got exploited by Gödel's theorem, which is basically the story of computational

2:17:21.680 --> 2:17:26.720
 irreducibility. It's that even though you know those underlying rules, you can't deduce all

2:17:26.720 --> 2:17:34.000
 the consequences in any finite way. But now the question is, okay, so they broke mathematics down

2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:40.160
 into these axioms, and they say now you build up from that. So what I'm increasingly coming to

2:17:40.160 --> 2:17:46.960
 realize is that's similar to saying let's take a gas and break it down into molecules. There's gas

2:17:46.960 --> 2:17:52.480
 laws that are the large scale structure and so on that we humans are familiar with, and then there's

2:17:52.480 --> 2:17:57.680
 the underlying molecular dynamics. And I think that the axiomatic level of mathematics, which

2:17:57.680 --> 2:18:02.640
 we can access with automated theorem proving and proof assistance and these kinds of things,

2:18:02.640 --> 2:18:07.440
 that's the molecular dynamics of mathematics. And occasionally we see through to that molecular

2:18:07.440 --> 2:18:12.160
 dynamics. We see undecidability, we see other things like this. One of the things I've always

2:18:12.160 --> 2:18:18.560
 found very mysterious is that Gödel's theorem shows that there are sort of things which cannot

2:18:18.560 --> 2:18:23.280
 be finitely proved in mathematics. There are proofs of arbitrary length, infinite length proofs that

2:18:23.280 --> 2:18:28.080
 you might need. But in practical mathematics, mathematicians don't typically run into this.

2:18:28.080 --> 2:18:32.640
 They just happily go along doing their mathematics. And I think what's actually

2:18:32.640 --> 2:18:38.160
 happening is that what they're doing is they're looking at this. They are essentially observers

2:18:38.720 --> 2:18:45.440
 in metamathematical space, and they are picking a reference frame in metamathematical space,

2:18:45.440 --> 2:18:49.120
 and they are computationally bounded observers in metamathematical space,

2:18:49.120 --> 2:18:55.520
 which is causing them to deduce that the laws of metamathematics and the laws of mathematics,

2:18:55.520 --> 2:19:00.080
 like the laws of fluid mechanics, are much more understandable than this underlying

2:19:00.080 --> 2:19:06.320
 molecular dynamics. And so what gets really bizarre is thinking about kind of the analogy

2:19:06.320 --> 2:19:14.960
 between metamathematics, this idea of you exist in this sort of space of possible,

2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:21.760
 in this kind of mathematical space where the individual kind of points in the mathematical

2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:27.280
 space are statements in mathematics, and they're connected by proofs where one statement, you know,

2:19:27.280 --> 2:19:30.960
 you take a couple of different statements, you can use those to prove some other statement,

2:19:30.960 --> 2:19:35.760
 and you've got this whole network of proofs. That's the kind of causal network of mathematics,

2:19:35.760 --> 2:19:42.720
 of what can prove what and so on. And you can say at any moment in the history of a mathematician,

2:19:42.720 --> 2:19:49.280
 of a single mathematical consciousness, you are in a single kind of slice of this

2:19:49.280 --> 2:19:54.000
 kind of metamathematical space. You know a certain set of mathematical statements.

2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:58.640
 You can then deduce with proofs, you can deduce other ones, and so on. You're kind of gradually

2:19:58.640 --> 2:20:04.400
 moving through metamathematical space. And so it's kind of the view is that the reason that

2:20:04.400 --> 2:20:10.160
 mathematicians perceive mathematics to have the sort of integrity and lack of kind of undecidability

2:20:10.160 --> 2:20:15.360
 and so on that they do is because they, like we as observers of the physical universe,

2:20:15.360 --> 2:20:19.920
 we have these limitations associated with computational boundedness, single thread of time,

2:20:19.920 --> 2:20:24.960
 consciousness limitations, basically, that the same thing is true of mathematicians perceiving

2:20:24.960 --> 2:20:30.080
 sort of metamathematical space. And so what's happening is that if you look at one of these

2:20:30.080 --> 2:20:36.640
 formalized mathematics systems, something like Pythagoras's theorem, it'll take, oh, I don't know,

2:20:37.680 --> 2:20:43.600
 what is it, maybe 10,000 individual little steps to prove Pythagoras's theorem. And one of the

2:20:43.600 --> 2:20:48.400
 bizarre things that's sort of an empirical fact that I'm trying to understand a little bit better,

2:20:48.400 --> 2:20:54.160
 if you look at different formalized mathematics systems, they actually have different axioms

2:20:54.160 --> 2:20:59.200
 underneath that they can all prove Pythagoras's theorem. And so in other words, it's a little bit

2:20:59.200 --> 2:21:03.840
 like what happens with gases. We can have air molecules, we can have water molecules, but they

2:21:03.840 --> 2:21:09.440
 still have fluid dynamics. Both of them have fluid dynamics. And so similarly, at the level that

2:21:09.440 --> 2:21:14.000
 mathematicians care about mathematics, it's way above the molecular dynamics, so to speak.

2:21:14.560 --> 2:21:18.160
 And there are all kinds of weird things. Like, for example, one thing I was realizing recently

2:21:18.160 --> 2:21:23.280
 is that the quantum theory of mathematics, that's a very bizarre idea. But basically,

2:21:23.280 --> 2:21:29.520
 when you prove what is a proof is you've got one statement in mathematics, you go through

2:21:29.520 --> 2:21:32.960
 other statements, you eventually get to a statement you're trying to prove, for example,

2:21:32.960 --> 2:21:38.880
 that's a path in metamathematical space. And that's a single path, a single proof is a single

2:21:38.880 --> 2:21:44.960
 path. But you can imagine there are other proofs of the same result. There are a bundle of proofs.

2:21:44.960 --> 2:21:48.560
 There's this whole set of possible proofs. Yeah, you could think of it as branching,

2:21:48.560 --> 2:21:52.320
 similar to the quantum mechanics model that you were talking about. Exactly. And then there's

2:21:52.320 --> 2:21:56.720
 some invariance that you can formalize in the same way that you can for the quantum mechanical.

2:21:56.720 --> 2:22:01.520
 Right. So the question is, in proof space, as you start thinking about multiple proofs,

2:22:01.520 --> 2:22:05.680
 are there analogs of, for example, destructive interference of multiple proofs? So here's a

2:22:05.680 --> 2:22:12.480
 bizarre idea that's just a couple of days old, so not yet fully formed. But as you try and do that,

2:22:12.480 --> 2:22:16.240
 when you have two different proofs, it's like two photons going in different directions,

2:22:16.240 --> 2:22:20.960
 you have two proofs, which at an intermediate stage are incompatible. And that's kind of like

2:22:20.960 --> 2:22:26.960
 destructive interference. Is it possible for this to instruct the engineering of automated proof

2:22:26.960 --> 2:22:31.920
 systems? Absolutely. I mean, as a practical matter, I mean, you know, this whole question,

2:22:31.920 --> 2:22:36.560
 in fact, Jonathan Gorod has a nice heuristic for automated theorem provers that's based on

2:22:36.560 --> 2:22:44.400
 our physics project that is looking for essentially using kind of using energy in our

2:22:44.400 --> 2:22:51.040
 models. Energy is kind of level of activity in this hypergraph. And so it's sort of a heuristic

2:22:51.040 --> 2:22:57.440
 for automated theorem proving about how do you pick which path to go down that is based on

2:22:57.440 --> 2:23:03.600
 essentially physics. And I mean, the thing that gets interesting about this is the way that one

2:23:03.600 --> 2:23:07.360
 can sort of have the interplay between, like, for example, a black hole. What is a black hole

2:23:07.360 --> 2:23:12.960
 in metamathematics? So the answer is, what is black hole in physics? A black hole in physics

2:23:12.960 --> 2:23:19.600
 is where in the simplest form of black hole time ends. That is all, you know, everything is crunched

2:23:19.600 --> 2:23:24.960
 down to the space time singularity, and everything just ends up at that singularity. So in our

2:23:24.960 --> 2:23:29.520
 models, and that's a little hard to understand in general relativity with continuous mathematics,

2:23:29.520 --> 2:23:33.840
 and what does singularity look like? In our models, it's something very pragmatic. It's just,

2:23:33.840 --> 2:23:37.760
 you're applying these rules, time is moving forward. And then there comes a moment where

2:23:37.760 --> 2:23:43.280
 the rules, no rules apply. So time stops. It's kind of like the universe dies, that, you know,

2:23:43.280 --> 2:23:49.200
 that nothing happens in the universe anymore. Well, in mathematics, that's a decidable theory.

2:23:49.200 --> 2:23:53.280
 That's a theory. So theories which have undecidability, which are things like

2:23:53.280 --> 2:23:58.400
 arithmetic, set theory, all the serious models, theories in mathematics, they all have the feature

2:23:58.400 --> 2:24:02.960
 that there are proofs of arbitrarily long length. In something like Boolean algebra,

2:24:02.960 --> 2:24:07.680
 which is a decidable theory, there are, you know, any question in Boolean algebra, you can just go

2:24:07.680 --> 2:24:13.360
 crunch, crunch, crunch, and in a known number of steps, you can answer it. You know, satisfiability,

2:24:13.360 --> 2:24:17.840
 you know, might be hard, but it's still a bounded number of steps to answer any satisfiability

2:24:17.840 --> 2:24:26.000
 problem. And so that's the notion of a black hole in physics where time stops. That's analogous to

2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:32.640
 in mathematics where there aren't infinite length proofs, where when in physics, you know, you can

2:24:32.640 --> 2:24:36.080
 wander around the universe forever if you don't run into a black hole. If you run into a black

2:24:36.080 --> 2:24:41.760
 hole and time stops, you're done. And it's the same thing in mathematics between decidable

2:24:41.760 --> 2:24:47.360
 theories and undecidable theories. That's an example. And I think where sort of the attempt

2:24:47.360 --> 2:24:54.400
 to understand, so another question is kind of what is the general activity of metamathematics?

2:24:54.400 --> 2:24:59.440
 What is the bulk theory of metamathematics? So in the literature of mathematics, there are about

2:24:59.440 --> 2:25:05.040
 three million theorems that people have published. And those represent, it's kind of on this, it's

2:25:05.040 --> 2:25:11.760
 like on the earth, we would be, you know, we've put cities in particular places on the earth,

2:25:11.760 --> 2:25:15.440
 but yet there is ultimately, you know, we know the earth is roughly spherical,

2:25:15.440 --> 2:25:20.640
 and there's an underlying space. And we could just talk about, you know, the world of space

2:25:20.640 --> 2:25:24.720
 in terms of where our cities happen to be, but there's actually an underlying space. And so the

2:25:24.720 --> 2:25:29.360
 question is, what's that for metamathematics? And as we kind of explore what is, for example,

2:25:29.360 --> 2:25:34.640
 for mathematics, which is always likes taking sort of abstract limits. So an obvious abstract

2:25:34.640 --> 2:25:40.480
 limit for mathematics to take is the limit of the future of mathematics. That is, what will be,

2:25:40.480 --> 2:25:44.640
 you know, the ultimate structure of mathematics. And one of the things that's an empirical

2:25:44.640 --> 2:25:49.520
 observation about mathematics that's quite interesting is that a lot of theories in one

2:25:49.520 --> 2:25:54.560
 area of mathematics, algebraic geometry or something, might have, they play into another area

2:25:54.560 --> 2:26:00.880
 of mathematics. That same kind of fundamental construct seemed to occur in very different

2:26:00.880 --> 2:26:04.880
 areas of mathematics. And that's structurally captured a bit with category theory and things

2:26:04.880 --> 2:26:09.760
 like that. But I think that there's probably an understanding of this metamathematical space that

2:26:09.760 --> 2:26:15.200
 will explain why different areas of mathematics ultimately sort of map into the same thing.

2:26:15.200 --> 2:26:21.840
 And I mean, you know, my little challenge to myself is what's time dilation in metamathematics?

2:26:21.840 --> 2:26:27.440
 In other words, as you basically, as you move around in this mathematical space of possible

2:26:27.440 --> 2:26:33.280
 statements, you know, how does that moving around? It's basically what's happening is

2:26:33.280 --> 2:26:36.720
 that as you move around in the space of mathematical statements, it's like you're

2:26:36.720 --> 2:26:42.080
 changing from algebra to geometry to whatever else. And you're trying to prove the same theorem.

2:26:42.080 --> 2:26:46.960
 But as you try, if you keep on moving to these different places, it's slower to prove that

2:26:46.960 --> 2:26:50.480
 theorem because you keep on having to translate what you're doing back to where you started from.

2:26:50.480 --> 2:26:54.640
 And that's kind of the beginnings of the analog of time dilation in metamathematics.

2:26:54.640 --> 2:26:57.440
 Plus, there's probably fractional dimensions in this space as well.

2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:02.960
 Oh, this space is a very messy space. This space is much messier than physical space. I mean,

2:27:02.960 --> 2:27:09.280
 even in the models of physics, physical space is very tame compared to branchial space and

2:27:09.280 --> 2:27:14.160
 ruleal space. I mean, the mathematical structure, you know, branchial space is probably more like

2:27:14.160 --> 2:27:20.480
 Hilbert space, but it's a rather complicated Hilbert space. And ruleal space is more like

2:27:20.480 --> 2:27:25.520
 this weird infinity groupoid story of Grothendieck. And, you know, I can explain that a little bit

2:27:25.520 --> 2:27:34.400
 because in metamathematical space, a path in metamathematical space is a path between two

2:27:34.400 --> 2:27:39.920
 statements is a way to get by proofs, is a way to find a proof that goes from one statement to

2:27:39.920 --> 2:27:45.360
 another. And so one of the things you can do, you can think about is between statements, you've got

2:27:45.360 --> 2:27:50.560
 proofs and they are paths between statements. Okay, so now you can go to the next level and you

2:27:50.560 --> 2:27:56.480
 can ask, what about a mapping from one proof to another? And so that's in category theory,

2:27:56.480 --> 2:28:01.680
 that's kind of a higher category, the notion of higher categories where you're mapping not just

2:28:03.280 --> 2:28:07.360
 between objects, but you're mapping between the mappings between objects and so on.

2:28:07.360 --> 2:28:12.160
 And so you can keep doing that. You keep saying higher order proofs. I want mappings between

2:28:12.160 --> 2:28:17.360
 proofs between proofs and so on. And that limiting structure, oh, by the way, one thing that's very

2:28:17.360 --> 2:28:22.160
 interesting is imagine in proof space, you've got these two proofs. And the question is,

2:28:22.160 --> 2:28:26.480
 what is the topology of proof space? In other words, if you take these two paths,

2:28:26.480 --> 2:28:31.040
 can you continuously deform them into each other? Or is there some big hole in the middle that

2:28:31.040 --> 2:28:35.040
 prevents you from continuously deforming them one into the other? It's kind of like, you know,

2:28:35.040 --> 2:28:39.760
 when you think about some, I don't know, some puzzle, for example, you're moving pieces around

2:28:39.760 --> 2:28:44.000
 on some puzzle, and you can think about the space of possible states of the puzzle.

2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:47.680
 And you can make this graph that shows from one state of the puzzle to another state of

2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:52.400
 the puzzle and so on. And sometimes you can easily get from one state to any other state,

2:28:52.400 --> 2:28:56.720
 but sometimes there'll be a hole in that space. And there'll be, you know, you always have to

2:28:56.720 --> 2:29:01.680
 go around the circuitous route to get from here to there. There won't be any direct way.

2:29:01.680 --> 2:29:07.440
 That's kind of a question of whether there's sort of an obstruction in the space. And so the question

2:29:07.440 --> 2:29:14.080
 is in proof space, what is the, what are, you know, what does it mean if there's an obstruction in proof

2:29:14.080 --> 2:29:19.600
 space? Yeah, I don't even know what an obstruction means in proof space because for it to be an

2:29:19.600 --> 2:29:25.040
 obstruction, it should be reachable some other way from some other place, right? So this is like

2:29:25.040 --> 2:29:30.240
 an unreachable part of the graph. No, it's not just an unreachable part. It's a part where

2:29:30.240 --> 2:29:34.240
 there are paths that go one way, there are paths that go the other way. And this question of

2:29:34.240 --> 2:29:39.200
 homotopy in mathematics is this question, can you continuously deform, you know, from one path to

2:29:39.200 --> 2:29:44.160
 another path or do you have to go in a jump, so to speak? So it's like if you're going around a

2:29:44.160 --> 2:29:48.480
 sphere, for example, if you're going around, I don't know, a cylinder or something, you can

2:29:48.480 --> 2:29:55.360
 wind around one way and you can, there's no paths where you can easily deform one path into another

2:29:55.360 --> 2:29:58.960
 because it's just sort of sitting on the same side of the cylinder. But when you've got something

2:29:58.960 --> 2:30:03.280
 that winds all the way around a cylinder, you can't continuously deform that down to a point

2:30:03.280 --> 2:30:07.360
 because it's, it's stuck wrapped around. My intuition about proof spaces, you should be

2:30:07.360 --> 2:30:10.880
 able to deform it. I mean that because then otherwise it doesn't even make sense because

2:30:11.600 --> 2:30:17.200
 if the topology matters of the way you move about the space that I don't even know what that means.

2:30:17.200 --> 2:30:22.320
 Well, what it would mean is that you would have one way of doing a proof of something over here

2:30:22.320 --> 2:30:27.120
 in algebra and another way of doing a proof of something over here in geometry. And there would

2:30:27.120 --> 2:30:32.800
 not be an intermediate way to map between those proofs. How would that be possible if they started

2:30:32.800 --> 2:30:37.120
 the same place and ended the same place? Well, it's the same thing as, you know,

2:30:37.120 --> 2:30:40.800
 we've got points on a, you know, if we've got paths on a cylinder.

2:30:40.800 --> 2:30:44.320
 Now I understand how it works in physical space, but it just doesn't,

2:30:44.320 --> 2:30:47.840
 it feels like proof space shouldn't have that. Okay. I mean,

2:30:47.840 --> 2:30:52.160
 I'm not sure. I don't know. We'll know very soon because we get to do some experiments. This is

2:30:52.160 --> 2:30:56.960
 the great thing about this stuff is that in fact, you know, in the next few days,

2:30:56.960 --> 2:31:01.920
 I hope to do a bunch of experiments on this. So you're playing like proofs in this kind of space.

2:31:01.920 --> 2:31:07.680
 Yes. Yes. I mean, so, you know, this is toy, you know, theories and, you know, we've got

2:31:07.680 --> 2:31:13.200
 good. So this kind of segues to perhaps another thing, which is this whole idea of multi computation.

2:31:13.200 --> 2:31:21.680
 So this is another kind of bigger idea that, so, okay, this has to do with how do you make models

2:31:21.680 --> 2:31:28.880
 of things? And it's going to, so I've sort of claimed that there've been sort of four epochs

2:31:28.880 --> 2:31:35.440
 in the history of making models of things. And this multi computation thing is the fourth,

2:31:35.440 --> 2:31:41.520
 is a new epoch. What are the first three? The first one is back in antiquity, ancient Greek

2:31:41.520 --> 2:31:46.480
 times. People were like, what's the universe made of? Oh, it's made of, you know, everything is

2:31:46.480 --> 2:31:52.800
 water, Thales, you know, or everything is made of atoms. It's sort of, what are things made of?

2:31:52.800 --> 2:31:58.080
 Or the, you know, there are these crystal spheres that represent where the planets are and so on.

2:31:58.080 --> 2:32:03.120
 It's like a structural idea of how the universe is constructed. There's no real notion of dynamics.

2:32:03.120 --> 2:32:08.720
 It's just, what is the universe? How is the universe made? Then we get to the 1600s and we

2:32:08.720 --> 2:32:14.720
 get to the sort of revolution of mathematics being introduced into physics. And then we have this

2:32:14.720 --> 2:32:21.120
 kind of idea of you write down some equation. The, what happens in the universe is the solving of

2:32:21.120 --> 2:32:26.720
 that equation. Time enters, but it's usually just a parameter. We just can, you know, sort of slide

2:32:26.720 --> 2:32:32.400
 it back and forth and say, here's where it is. Okay. Then we come to this kind of computational

2:32:32.400 --> 2:32:39.120
 idea that I kind of started really pushing in the early 1980s as a result, you know,

2:32:39.120 --> 2:32:43.280
 the things that we were talking about before about complexity, that was my motivation. But

2:32:43.280 --> 2:32:48.160
 the bigger story was the story of kind of computational models of things. And the big

2:32:48.160 --> 2:32:52.720
 difference there from the mathematical models is, in mathematical models, there's an equation,

2:32:52.720 --> 2:32:58.160
 you solve it, you kind of slide time to the place where you want it. In computational models,

2:32:58.720 --> 2:33:04.800
 you give the rule and then you just say, go run the rule. And time is not something you get to

2:33:04.800 --> 2:33:11.440
 slide. Time is something where it just, you run the rule, time goes in steps. And that's how you

2:33:11.440 --> 2:33:16.560
 work out how the system behaves. You don't, time is not just a parameter. Time is something that

2:33:16.560 --> 2:33:21.920
 is about the running of these rules. And so there's this computational irreducibility. You can't jump

2:33:21.920 --> 2:33:27.360
 ahead in time. But there's still, important thing is there's still one thread of time. It's still

2:33:27.360 --> 2:33:31.360
 the case, you know, the cellular automaton state, then it has the next state and the next state and

2:33:31.360 --> 2:33:36.400
 so on. The thing that is kind of, we've sort of tipped off by quantum mechanics in a sense,

2:33:36.400 --> 2:33:41.760
 although it actually feeds back even into relativity and things like that, that there's

2:33:41.760 --> 2:33:47.760
 these multiple threads of time. And so in this multi computation paradigm, the kind of idea is,

2:33:47.760 --> 2:33:52.240
 instead of there being the single thread of time, there are these kind of distributed asynchronous

2:33:52.240 --> 2:33:57.920
 threads of time that are happening. And the thing that's sort of different there is if you want to

2:33:57.920 --> 2:34:02.480
 know what happened, if you say what happened in the system, in the case of the computational

2:34:02.480 --> 2:34:08.880
 paradigm, you just say, well, after a thousand steps, we got this result, right? But in the

2:34:08.880 --> 2:34:13.200
 multi computational paradigm, after a thousand steps, not even clear what a thousand steps means,

2:34:13.200 --> 2:34:17.600
 because you've got all these different threads of time, but there is no state. There's all these

2:34:17.600 --> 2:34:22.240
 different possible, you know, there's all these different paths. And so the only way you can know

2:34:22.240 --> 2:34:27.280
 what happened is to have some kind of observer who is saying, here's how to parse the results

2:34:27.280 --> 2:34:31.600
 of what was going on. Right. But that observer is embedded and they don't have a complete picture.

2:34:31.600 --> 2:34:37.120
 So in the case of physics, that's right. Yes. And then in the, but that's, but so the idea is

2:34:37.120 --> 2:34:42.320
 that in this multi computation setup, that it's this idea of these multiple threads of time

2:34:42.320 --> 2:34:47.760
 and models that are based on that. And this is similar to what people think about in

2:34:47.760 --> 2:34:52.400
 non deterministic computation. So you have a Turing machine. Usually it has a definite state. It

2:34:52.400 --> 2:34:56.080
 follows another state, follows another state. But typically what people have done when they

2:34:56.080 --> 2:34:59.760
 thought about these kinds of things is they've said, well, there are all these possible paths,

2:34:59.760 --> 2:35:04.080
 and non deterministic Turing machine can follow all these possible paths, but we just want one

2:35:04.080 --> 2:35:08.880
 of them. We just want the one that's the winner that factors the number or whatever else. And

2:35:08.880 --> 2:35:13.520
 similarly, it's the same story in logic programming and so on, but we say, we've got this goal,

2:35:13.520 --> 2:35:18.320
 find us a path to that goal. I just want one path, then I'm happy. Or theorem proving,

2:35:18.320 --> 2:35:23.200
 same story. I just want one proof and then I'm happy. What's happening in multi computation

2:35:23.200 --> 2:35:29.440
 in physics is we actually care about many paths. And well, there is a case, for example, probabilistic

2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:33.920
 programming is a version of multi computation in which you're looking at all the paths. You're just

2:35:33.920 --> 2:35:39.280
 asking for probabilities of things. But in a sense in physics, we're taking different kinds of

2:35:39.280 --> 2:35:43.680
 samplings. For example, in quantum mechanics, we're taking a different kind of sampling

2:35:43.680 --> 2:35:51.280
 of all these multiple paths. But the thing that is notable is that when you're an observer embedded

2:35:51.280 --> 2:35:56.080
 in this thing, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, with various other sort of footnotes and so on,

2:35:56.080 --> 2:36:02.400
 it is inevitable that the thing that you parse out of the system looks like general relativity

2:36:02.400 --> 2:36:07.760
 and quantum mechanics. In other words, that just by the very structure of this multi computational

2:36:07.760 --> 2:36:16.720
 setup, it inevitably is the case that you have certain emergent laws. Now, why is this perhaps

2:36:16.720 --> 2:36:21.840
 not surprising? In thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, there are sort of inevitable emergent

2:36:21.840 --> 2:36:28.320
 laws of sort of gas dynamics that are independent of the details of the molecular dynamics,

2:36:28.320 --> 2:36:33.440
 sort of the same kind of thing. But I think what happens is what's a sort of a funny thing that I

2:36:33.440 --> 2:36:39.200
 just been understanding very recently is when when I kind of introduced this whole sort of

2:36:39.200 --> 2:36:44.880
 computational paradigm complexity ish thing back in the 80s, it was kind of like a big downer

2:36:44.880 --> 2:36:48.160
 because it's like there's a lot of stuff you can't say about what systems will do.

2:36:48.880 --> 2:36:52.800
 And then what I realized is and then you might say, now we've got multi computation, it's even

2:36:52.800 --> 2:36:56.960
 worse. You know, it isn't just one thread of time that we can't explain. It's all these threads of

2:36:56.960 --> 2:37:03.120
 time. It can't explain anything. But the following thing happens because there is all this

2:37:03.120 --> 2:37:08.720
 irreducibility and any detailed thing you might want to answer, it's very hard to answer. But

2:37:08.720 --> 2:37:13.760
 when you have an observer who has certain characteristics like computational boundedness,

2:37:13.760 --> 2:37:19.920
 sequentiality of time and so on, that observer only samples certain aspects of this incredible

2:37:19.920 --> 2:37:25.760
 complexity going on in this multi computational system. And that observer is sensitive only to

2:37:25.760 --> 2:37:30.960
 to some underlying core structure of this multi computational system. There is all this

2:37:30.960 --> 2:37:36.160
 irreducible computation going on, all these details. But to that kind of observer, what's

2:37:36.160 --> 2:37:41.760
 important is only the core structure of multi computation, which means that observer

2:37:41.760 --> 2:37:47.520
 observes comparatively simple laws. And I think it is inevitable that that observer

2:37:47.520 --> 2:37:51.920
 observes laws which are mathematically structured like general relativity and quantum

2:37:51.920 --> 2:37:56.240
 mechanics, which, by the way, are the same law in our in our model of physics.

2:37:56.240 --> 2:38:01.920
 So that's an explanation why there are simple laws that explain a lot for this observer.

2:38:01.920 --> 2:38:07.760
 Potentially, yes. But what the place where this gets really interesting is there are all these

2:38:07.760 --> 2:38:12.480
 fields of science where people have kind of gotten stuck, where they say we'd really love to

2:38:12.480 --> 2:38:16.800
 have a physics like theory of economics. We'd really love to have a physics like law and

2:38:16.800 --> 2:38:22.560
 linguistics. You got to talk about molecular biology here. OK, so where where where does

2:38:22.560 --> 2:38:27.040
 multi computation come in for biology? Economics is super interesting, too, but biology. OK,

2:38:27.040 --> 2:38:31.760
 let's talk about that. So let's talk about chemistry for a second. OK, so I mean, I have

2:38:31.760 --> 2:38:35.520
 to say, you know, this is it's such a weird business for me because, you know, there are

2:38:35.520 --> 2:38:39.840
 these kind of paradigmatic ideas and then the actual applications. And it's like I've always

2:38:39.840 --> 2:38:43.360
 said, I know nothing about chemistry. I learned all the chemistry I know, you know, the night

2:38:43.360 --> 2:38:47.520
 before some exam when I was 14 years old. But I've actually learned a bunch more chemistry.

2:38:47.520 --> 2:38:51.360
 And in Wolfram language these days, we have really pretty nice symbolic representation

2:38:51.360 --> 2:38:55.760
 of chemistry. And in understanding the design of that, I've actually, I think, learned a certain

2:38:55.760 --> 2:38:59.840
 amount of chemistry. So if you quizzed me on sort of basic high school chemistry, I would

2:38:59.840 --> 2:39:06.000
 probably totally fail. But but but OK, so what is chemistry? I mean, chemistry is sort of a

2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:11.200
 story of, you know, chemical reactions are like you've got this particular chemical that's

2:39:11.200 --> 2:39:15.840
 represented as some graph of, you know, these are these are this configuration of molecules

2:39:15.840 --> 2:39:20.480
 with these bonds and so on. And a chemical reaction happens. You've got these sort of

2:39:20.480 --> 2:39:24.720
 two graphs. They interact in some way. You've got another graph or multiple other graphs

2:39:24.720 --> 2:39:30.560
 out. So that's kind of the sort of the the abstract view of what's happening in chemistry.

2:39:30.560 --> 2:39:36.000
 And so when you do a chemical synthesis, for example, you are given certain sort of these

2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:40.640
 are possible reactions that can happen. And you're asked, can you piece together this

2:39:40.640 --> 2:39:45.120
 sequence of such reactions, a sequence of such sort of axiomatic reactions usually called name

2:39:45.120 --> 2:39:50.640
 reactions in chemistry? Can you piece together a sequence of these reactions so that you get out

2:39:50.640 --> 2:39:55.040
 at the end this great molecule you were trying to synthesize? And so that's a story very much

2:39:55.040 --> 2:40:00.160
 like theorem proving. And people have done actually they start in the 1960s looking at

2:40:00.720 --> 2:40:04.960
 kind of the theorem proving approach to that, although it didn't really it didn't it didn't

2:40:04.960 --> 2:40:09.920
 was sort of done too early, I think. But anyway, so that's kind of the view is that that chemistry,

2:40:09.920 --> 2:40:15.520
 chemical reactions are the story of of all these different sort of paths of possible things that

2:40:15.520 --> 2:40:22.640
 go on. OK, let's let's go to an even lower level. Let's say instead of asking about which species

2:40:22.640 --> 2:40:26.880
 of molecules we're talking about, let's look at individual molecules and let's say we're looking

2:40:26.880 --> 2:40:31.120
 at individual molecules and they are having chemical reactions and we're building up this

2:40:31.120 --> 2:40:36.000
 big graph of all these reactions that are happening. OK, so so then we've got this big

2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:41.760
 graph. And by the way, that big graph is incredibly similar to this hypergraph rewriting things.

2:40:42.400 --> 2:40:46.880
 In fact, in the underlying theory of multi computation there, these things we call token

2:40:46.880 --> 2:40:52.640
 event graphs, which are basically you've broken your state into tokens. Like in the case of a

2:40:52.640 --> 2:40:58.160
 hypergraph, you've broken it into hyper edges and each event is just consuming some number of tokens

2:40:58.160 --> 2:41:02.320
 and producing some number of tokens. But then you have to there's a lot of work to be done

2:41:02.320 --> 2:41:08.400
 on update rules in terms of what they actually are for chemistry. Yeah, what they offer are

2:41:08.400 --> 2:41:12.880
 observed chemistry. Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. And we've been working on that actually because we

2:41:12.880 --> 2:41:17.360
 have this beautiful system and Wolfram language for representing chemistry symbolically. So we

2:41:17.360 --> 2:41:21.440
 actually have you know, this is this is an ongoing thing to actually figure out what they are for

2:41:21.440 --> 2:41:26.480
 some practical cases. Does that require human injection or can it be automatically discovered

2:41:27.040 --> 2:41:30.960
 these update rules? Well, if we can do chemistry better, we could probably discover them

2:41:30.960 --> 2:41:35.600
 automatically. But I think in, in reality, right now, it's like there are these particular

2:41:35.600 --> 2:41:39.840
 reactions. And really, to understand what's going on, we're probably going to pick a particular

2:41:39.840 --> 2:41:45.440
 subtype of chemistry. And just because because let me explain where this is going to the place

2:41:45.440 --> 2:41:50.880
 that his his where this is going. So got this whole network of all these molecules,

2:41:50.880 --> 2:41:56.560
 having all these reactions and so on. And this is some whole multi computational story because each

2:41:56.560 --> 2:42:02.560
 each sort of chemical reaction event is its own separate event. We're saying they will happen

2:42:02.560 --> 2:42:07.120
 asynchronously. We're not describing in what order they happen. You know, maybe that order is governed

2:42:07.120 --> 2:42:11.280
 by some quantum mechanics thing doesn't really matter. We're just saying they happen in some

2:42:11.280 --> 2:42:16.720
 order. And then we ask, what is the what what's the you know, how do we think about the system?

2:42:16.720 --> 2:42:21.600
 Well, this thing is some kind of big multi computational system. The question is what is

2:42:21.600 --> 2:42:27.120
 the chemical observer? And one possible chemical observer is all you care about is did you make

2:42:27.120 --> 2:42:31.600
 that particular drug molecule? You're just asking, you know, the for the one path. Another thing you

2:42:31.600 --> 2:42:36.960
 might care about is I want to know the concentration of each species. I want to know,

2:42:36.960 --> 2:42:40.960
 you know, at every stage, I'm going to solve the differential equations that represent the

2:42:40.960 --> 2:42:46.240
 concentrations. And I want to know what those all are. But there's more. Because when and it's kind

2:42:46.240 --> 2:42:51.760
 of like you're going below and statistical mechanics, there's kind of all these molecules

2:42:51.760 --> 2:42:57.120
 bouncing around. And you might say, we're just going to ignore we're just going to look at the

2:42:57.120 --> 2:43:02.080
 aggregate densities of certain kinds of molecules. But you can look at a lower level, you can look

2:43:02.080 --> 2:43:08.480
 at this whole graph of possible interactions. And so the kind of the idea would be what, you know,

2:43:08.480 --> 2:43:14.240
 is the only chemical observer, one who just cares about overall concentrations? Or can there be a

2:43:14.240 --> 2:43:20.880
 chemical observer who cares about this network of what happened? And so that the question then is,

2:43:20.880 --> 2:43:25.440
 so let me give an analogy. So this is where I think this is potentially very relevant to molecular

2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:32.000
 biology and molecular computing. When we think about a computation, usually, we say it's input,

2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:36.320
 it's output, we, you know, or chemistry, we say there's this input, we're going to make this

2:43:36.320 --> 2:43:42.960
 molecule as the output. But what if what we actually encode, what if our computation, what

2:43:42.960 --> 2:43:48.160
 thing we care about is some part of this dynamic network? What if it isn't just the input and the

2:43:48.160 --> 2:43:52.320
 output that we care about? What if there's some dynamics of the network that we care about? Now,

2:43:52.320 --> 2:43:57.840
 imagine you're a chemical observer, what is a chemical observer? Well, in molecular biology,

2:43:57.840 --> 2:44:03.280
 there are all kinds of weird sorts of observers, there are membranes that exist, that have, you

2:44:03.280 --> 2:44:08.080
 know, different kinds of molecules that can bind to them, things like this, it's not obvious that

2:44:08.080 --> 2:44:13.760
 the from a human scale, we just measure the concentration of something is the relevant story.

2:44:13.760 --> 2:44:18.480
 We can imagine that, for example, when we look at this whole network of possible reactions,

2:44:18.480 --> 2:44:22.640
 we can imagine, you know, at a physical level, we can imagine, well, what was the actual momentum

2:44:22.640 --> 2:44:26.880
 direction of that of that molecule? What was it which we don't pay any attention to when we're

2:44:26.880 --> 2:44:31.040
 just talking about chemical concentrations? What was the orientation of that molecule,

2:44:31.040 --> 2:44:36.800
 these kinds of things? And so here's the place where I'm, I have a little suspicion, okay? So

2:44:36.800 --> 2:44:41.600
 one of the questions in biology is what matters in biology? And that is, you know, we have all

2:44:41.600 --> 2:44:46.640
 these chemical reactions, we have all these, all these molecular processes going on in, you know,

2:44:46.640 --> 2:44:52.720
 in biological systems, what matters? And, you know, one of the things is to be able to tell

2:44:52.720 --> 2:44:57.600
 what matters, well, so a big story of the what matters question was what happened in genetics

2:44:57.600 --> 2:45:03.040
 in 1953, when DNA, when it was figured out how DNA worked. Because before that time, you know,

2:45:03.040 --> 2:45:07.440
 genetics have been all these different effects and complicated things. And then it was realized,

2:45:07.440 --> 2:45:12.480
 ah, there's something new, a molecule can store information, which wasn't obvious before that

2:45:12.480 --> 2:45:17.040
 time, a single molecule can store information. So there's a place where there can be something

2:45:17.040 --> 2:45:21.760
 important that's happening in molecular biology, and it's just in the sequence that's storing

2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:28.720
 information in a molecule. So the possibility now is imagine this dynamic network, this, you know,

2:45:28.720 --> 2:45:33.920
 causal graphs and multiway causal graphs and so on, that represent all of these different reactions

2:45:33.920 --> 2:45:39.360
 between molecules. What if there is some aspect of that, that is storing information that's relevant

2:45:39.360 --> 2:45:45.120
 for molecular biology? And the dynamic aspect of that. Yes, that's right. So that it's similar to

2:45:45.120 --> 2:45:50.480
 how the structure of a DNA molecule stores information, it could be the dynamics of the

2:45:50.480 --> 2:45:56.800
 system somehow stores information. And this kind of process might allow you to give predictions

2:45:56.800 --> 2:46:03.360
 of what that would be. Well, yes, but also imagine that you're trying to do, for example, imagine

2:46:03.360 --> 2:46:08.240
 you're trying to do molecular computation. Okay. You might think the way we're going to do molecular

2:46:08.240 --> 2:46:11.600
 computation is we're just going to run the thing. We're going to see what came out. We're going to

2:46:11.600 --> 2:46:16.960
 see what molecule came out. This is saying that's not the only thing you can do. There is a different

2:46:16.960 --> 2:46:22.240
 kind of chemical observer that you can imagine constructing, which is somehow sensitive to this

2:46:22.240 --> 2:46:27.360
 dynamic network. Exactly how that works, how we make that measurement, I don't know, but a few

2:46:27.360 --> 2:46:33.200
 ideas, but that's what's important, so to speak. And that means, and by the way, you can do the

2:46:33.200 --> 2:46:39.040
 same thing even for Turing machines. You can say, if you have a multiway Turing machine, you can say,

2:46:39.040 --> 2:46:43.600
 how do you compute with a multiway Turing machine? You can't say, well, we've got this input and this

2:46:43.600 --> 2:46:48.640
 output because the thing has all these threads of time and it's got lots of outputs. And so then you

2:46:48.640 --> 2:46:53.200
 say, well, what does it even mean to be a universal multiway Turing machine? I don't fully know the

2:46:53.200 --> 2:46:59.200
 answer to that. It's an interesting idea. It would freak Turing out for sure, because then the

2:46:59.200 --> 2:47:05.840
 dynamics of the trajectory of the computation matters. Yes. Yes. I mean, but the thing is

2:47:05.840 --> 2:47:10.560
 that that, so this is again, a story of what's the observer, so to speak. In chemistry, what's

2:47:10.560 --> 2:47:16.480
 the observer there? Now to give an example of where that might matter, a very sort of present

2:47:16.480 --> 2:47:23.840
 day example is in immunology, where we have whatever it is, 10 billion different kinds of

2:47:23.840 --> 2:47:29.680
 antibodies that are all these different shapes and so on. We have a trillion different kinds of T

2:47:29.680 --> 2:47:37.120
 cell receptors that we produce. And the traditional theory of immunology is this clonal

2:47:37.120 --> 2:47:42.320
 selection theory where we are constantly producing, randomly producing all these different antibodies.

2:47:42.320 --> 2:47:46.880
 And as soon as one of them binds to an antigen, then that one gets amplified and we produce more

2:47:46.880 --> 2:47:53.920
 of that antibody and so on. Back in the 1960s, an immunologist called Nils Joerner, who was the guy

2:47:53.920 --> 2:47:59.520
 who invented monoclonal antibodies, various other things, kind of had this network theory of the

2:47:59.520 --> 2:48:04.240
 immune system where it would be like, well, we produce antibodies, but then we produce antibodies

2:48:04.240 --> 2:48:09.120
 to the antibodies, anti antibodies, and we produce anti anti antibodies. And we get this whole dynamic

2:48:09.120 --> 2:48:16.400
 network of interactions between different immune system cells. And that was kind of a qualitative

2:48:16.400 --> 2:48:21.360
 theory at that time. And I've been a little disappointed because I've been studying immunology

2:48:21.360 --> 2:48:26.080
 a bit recently. And I knew something about this like 35 years ago or something. And I knew,

2:48:26.080 --> 2:48:29.280
 you know, I'd read a bunch of the books and I talked to a bunch of the people and so on.

2:48:29.280 --> 2:48:35.280
 And it was like an emerging theoretical immunology world. And then I look at the books now,

2:48:35.280 --> 2:48:39.760
 and they're very thick because they've got, you know, there's just a ton known about immunology

2:48:39.760 --> 2:48:43.680
 and, you know, all these different pathways, all these different details and so on.

2:48:43.680 --> 2:48:51.440
 But the theoretical sections seem to have shrunk. And so it's so the question is, what, you know,

2:48:51.440 --> 2:48:55.680
 for example, immune memory, where is the where does the immune memory reside? Is it actually

2:48:55.680 --> 2:48:59.920
 some cells sitting in our bone marrow that is, you know, living for the whole of our lives that's

2:48:59.920 --> 2:49:05.120
 going to spring into action as soon as we're shown the same antigen? Or is it something different

2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:09.520
 from that? Is it something more dynamic? Is it something more like some network of interactions

2:49:09.520 --> 2:49:14.000
 between these different kinds of immune system cells and so on? And it's known that there are

2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:19.040
 plenty of interactions between T cells and, you know, there's plenty of dynamics. But what the

2:49:19.040 --> 2:49:24.880
 consequence of that dynamics is, is not clear. And to have a qualitative theory for that doesn't

2:49:25.840 --> 2:49:30.240
 seem to exist. In fact, I was just been trying to study this. So I'm quite incomplete in my study

2:49:30.240 --> 2:49:34.320
 of these things. But I was a little bit taken aback because I've been looking at these things

2:49:34.320 --> 2:49:37.680
 and it's like, and then they get to the end where they have the most advanced theory that they've

2:49:37.680 --> 2:49:43.920
 got. And it turns out it's a cellular automaton theory. It's like, okay, well, at least I understand

2:49:43.920 --> 2:49:52.160
 that theory. But but, you know, I think that the possibility is that in that this is a place where

2:49:52.160 --> 2:49:56.720
 if you want to know, you know, explain roughly how the immune system works, it ends up being

2:49:56.720 --> 2:50:02.240
 this sort of dynamic network. And then the the, you know, the immune consciousness, so to speak,

2:50:02.240 --> 2:50:06.960
 the observer ends up being something that, you know, in the end, it's kind of like, does the

2:50:06.960 --> 2:50:12.080
 human get sick or whatever? But it's a it's something which is a complicated story that

2:50:12.080 --> 2:50:16.800
 relates to this whole sort of dynamic network and so on. And I think that's another place where this

2:50:16.800 --> 2:50:23.040
 kind of notion of where I think multi computation has the possibility. See, one of the things, okay,

2:50:23.040 --> 2:50:27.520
 you can end up with something where yes, there is a general relativity in there. But it turns up,

2:50:27.520 --> 2:50:33.360
 but it may turn out that the observer who sees general relativity in the immune system is an

2:50:33.360 --> 2:50:37.600
 observer that's irrelevant to what we care about about the immune system. I mean, it could be yes,

2:50:37.600 --> 2:50:43.280
 there is some effect where, you know, there's some, you know, time dilation of T cells interacting

2:50:43.280 --> 2:50:47.600
 with whatever. But it's like, that's an effect that's just irrelevant. And the thing we actually

2:50:47.600 --> 2:50:52.880
 care about is things about, you know, what happens when you have a vaccine that goes into some place

2:50:52.880 --> 2:50:57.760
 in shapespace? And, you know, how does that affect other places in shapespace? And how does that spread?

2:50:57.760 --> 2:51:01.840
 You know, what's the what's the analog of the speed of light in shapespace, for example, that's an

2:51:01.840 --> 2:51:06.160
 that's an important issue. If you have one of these dynamic theories, it's like, you know, you

2:51:06.160 --> 2:51:10.400
 you're poking to shapespace by having, you know, let's say, a vaccine or something that has a

2:51:10.400 --> 2:51:16.960
 particular configuration in shapespace. How, how quickly as this dynamic network spreads out, how

2:51:16.960 --> 2:51:22.160
 quickly do you get sort of other antibodies in different places in shapespace, things like that?

2:51:22.160 --> 2:51:26.560
 When you say shapespace, you mean the shape of the molecules? And then, so this is like,

2:51:27.520 --> 2:51:31.440
 could be deeply connected to the protein and multi protein folding, all of that kind of stuff.

2:51:32.080 --> 2:51:36.240
 To be able to say something interesting about the the dance of proteins that

2:51:36.240 --> 2:51:36.960
 Right, exactly.

2:51:36.960 --> 2:51:44.160
 then actually has an impact on helping develop drugs, for example, or has an impact on

2:51:44.800 --> 2:51:46.800
 virology, immunology, helping.

2:51:46.800 --> 2:51:54.080
 Well, I think the big thing is, you know, when we think about molecular biology, the you know,

2:51:54.080 --> 2:51:58.640
 what, what is the qualitative way to think about it? You know, in other words, is it chemical

2:51:58.640 --> 2:52:05.920
 reaction networks? Is it, you know, genetics, you know, DNA, big, you know, big news, it's kind of

2:52:05.920 --> 2:52:10.800
 there's a digital aspect to the whole thing. You know, what is the qualitative way to think about

2:52:10.800 --> 2:52:15.200
 how things work in biology? You know, when we think about, I don't know, some phenomenon like

2:52:15.200 --> 2:52:18.880
 aging or something, which is a big, complicated phenomenon, which just seems to have all these

2:52:18.880 --> 2:52:23.600
 different tentacles. Is it really the case that that can be thought about in some, you know,

2:52:23.600 --> 2:52:29.040
 without DNA, when people were describing, you know, genetic phenomena, there were, you know,

2:52:29.040 --> 2:52:33.680
 dominant recessive, this, that and the other got very, very complicated. And then people realize,

2:52:33.680 --> 2:52:38.400
 oh, it's just, you know, and what is a gene and so on and so on and so on. Then people realize

2:52:38.400 --> 2:52:42.480
 it's just base pairs. And there's this digital representation. And so the question is, what is

2:52:42.480 --> 2:52:47.200
 the overarching representation that we can now start to think about using a molecular biology?

2:52:47.200 --> 2:52:51.920
 I don't know how this will work out. And this is again, one of these things where, and the place

2:52:51.920 --> 2:52:58.000
 where that gets important is, you know, maybe molecular biology is doing molecular computing

2:52:58.000 --> 2:53:03.760
 by using some dynamic process that is something where it is very happily saying, oh, I just got

2:53:03.760 --> 2:53:07.680
 a result. It's in the dynamic structure of this network. Now I'm going to go and do some other

2:53:07.680 --> 2:53:12.320
 thing based on that result, for example. But we're like, oh, I don't know what's going on. You know,

2:53:12.320 --> 2:53:17.520
 it's just, we just measured the levels of these chemicals and we couldn't conclude anything.

2:53:17.520 --> 2:53:22.880
 But it just, we're looking at the wrong thing. And so that's the, that's kind of the potential

2:53:22.880 --> 2:53:30.080
 there. And it's, I mean, these things are, I don't know, it's for me, it's like, I've not really,

2:53:30.080 --> 2:53:34.400
 that was not a view. I mean, I've thought about molecular computing for ages and ages and ages.

2:53:34.400 --> 2:53:40.400
 And I've always imagined that the big story is kind of the original promise of nanotechnology

2:53:40.400 --> 2:53:45.920
 of like, can we make a molecular scale constructor that will just build a molecule in any shape?

2:53:45.920 --> 2:53:50.880
 I don't think I'm now increasingly concluding that's not the big point. The big point is

2:53:50.880 --> 2:53:56.000
 something more dynamic. That will be an interesting endpoint for any of these things. But that's

2:53:56.000 --> 2:54:00.160
 perhaps not the thing, you know, because the one example we have in molecular computing

2:54:00.160 --> 2:54:05.840
 that's really working is us biological organisms. And, you know, maybe the thing that's important

2:54:05.840 --> 2:54:10.880
 there is not this, you know, what chemicals do you make, so to speak, but more this kind of

2:54:10.880 --> 2:54:15.440
 dynamic process. The dynamic process. And then you can have a good model like the hypergraph to then

2:54:15.440 --> 2:54:22.640
 explore what, like simulate again, make predictions. And if they, I think just have a way to reason

2:54:22.640 --> 2:54:28.160
 about biology. I mean, it's hard, you know, but first of all, biology doesn't have theories like

2:54:28.160 --> 2:54:34.080
 physics. You know, physics is a much more successful sort of global theory kind of area.

2:54:34.080 --> 2:54:39.120
 You know, biology, what are the global theories of biology? Pretty much Darwinian evolution. That's

2:54:39.120 --> 2:54:43.440
 the only global theory of biology. You know, are there any other theories just say, well,

2:54:43.440 --> 2:54:47.840
 the kidneys work this way, this thing works this way and so on. There isn't, I suppose,

2:54:47.840 --> 2:54:52.640
 another global theory is digital information in DNA. That's another sort of global fact about

2:54:52.640 --> 2:55:00.400
 biology. But the difficult thing to do is to match something you have a model of in the hypergraph

2:55:00.400 --> 2:55:05.120
 to the actual, like how do you discover the theory? How do you discover the theory? Okay,

2:55:05.120 --> 2:55:10.080
 you have something that looks nice and makes sense, but like you have to match it to validation.

2:55:10.080 --> 2:55:14.320
 Oh, sure. Right. And that's tricky because you're walking around in the dark.

2:55:15.280 --> 2:55:20.320
 Not entirely. I mean, so, you know, for example, in what we've been trying to think about is

2:55:20.320 --> 2:55:26.960
 take actual chemical reactions. Okay. So, you know, one of my goals is can I compute the primes

2:55:26.960 --> 2:55:33.200
 with molecules? Okay. If I can do that, then I kind of, maybe I can compute things. And, you know,

2:55:33.200 --> 2:55:37.520
 there's this nice automated lab, these guys, these Emerald Cloud Lab people have built with

2:55:37.520 --> 2:55:42.000
 Wolfram language and so on. That's an actual physical lab and you send it a piece of Wolfram

2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:47.760
 language code and it goes and, you know, actually does physical experiments. And so one of my goals,

2:55:47.760 --> 2:55:52.880
 because I'm not a test tube kind of guy, I'm more of a software kind of person, is can I make

2:55:52.880 --> 2:55:57.840
 something where, you know, in this automated lab, we can actually get it so that there's some gel

2:55:57.840 --> 2:56:02.720
 that we made and, you know, the positions of the stripes are the primes. I love it. Yeah.

2:56:02.720 --> 2:56:08.720
 I mean, that would be an example of where, and that would be with a particular, you know,

2:56:08.720 --> 2:56:13.120
 framework for actually doing the molecular computing, you know, with particular kinds

2:56:13.120 --> 2:56:18.000
 of molecules. And there's a lot of kind of ambient technological mess, so to speak,

2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:22.240
 associated with, oh, is it carbon? Is it this? Is it that? You know, is it important that there's

2:56:22.240 --> 2:56:26.240
 a bromine atom here, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This is all chemistry that I don't know

2:56:26.240 --> 2:56:32.000
 much about. And, you know, that's a sort of, you know, unfortunately that's down at the level,

2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:36.080
 you know, I would like to be at the software level, not at the level of the transistors,

2:56:36.080 --> 2:56:40.560
 so to speak. But in chemistry, you know, there's a certain amount we have to do, I think, at the

2:56:40.560 --> 2:56:45.280
 level of transistors before we get up to being able to do it. Although, you know, the automated

2:56:45.280 --> 2:56:52.400
 labs certainly help in setting that up. I talked to a guy named Charles Hoskinson.

2:56:52.960 --> 2:56:58.640
 He mentioned that he's collaborating with you. He's an interesting guy. He sends me papers on

2:56:58.640 --> 2:57:04.160
 speaking of automated theorem proving a lot. He's exceptionally well read on that area as well.

2:57:04.160 --> 2:57:08.240
 So what's the nature of your collaboration with him? He's the creator of Cardano.

2:57:08.240 --> 2:57:13.680
 What's the nature of the collaboration between Cardano and the whole space of blockchain and

2:57:13.680 --> 2:57:19.200
 Wolfram, Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram blockchain, all that kind of stuff? Well, OK, we're segueing to a

2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:26.240
 slightly different world. But so although not completely unconnected. Right. The whole thing

2:57:26.240 --> 2:57:31.520
 is somehow connected. I know. I mean, you know, the strange thing in my life is I've sort of

2:57:31.520 --> 2:57:36.960
 alternated between doing basic science and doing technology about five times in my life so far.

2:57:36.960 --> 2:57:42.160
 And the thing that's just crazy about it is, you know, every time I do one of these alternations,

2:57:42.160 --> 2:57:46.160
 I think there's not going to be a way back to the other thing. And like I thought for this

2:57:46.160 --> 2:57:50.640
 physics project, I thought, you know, we're doing fundamental theory of physics. Maybe it'll have

2:57:50.640 --> 2:57:57.840
 an application in 200 years. But now I've realized actually this multi computation idea is is

2:57:57.840 --> 2:58:03.440
 applicable here now. It's and in fact, it's also giving us this way. I'll just mention one other

2:58:03.440 --> 2:58:11.040
 thing and then talk about blockchain. The the question of actually that relates to several

2:58:11.040 --> 2:58:18.960
 different things. But but one of the things about about OK, so our Wolfram language, which is our

2:58:18.960 --> 2:58:23.200
 attempt to kind of represent everything in the world computationally. And it's the thing I kind

2:58:23.200 --> 2:58:29.760
 of started building 40 years ago in the form of actual Wolfram language 35 years ago. It's kind

2:58:29.760 --> 2:58:37.520
 of this idea of can we can we express things about the world in computational terms? And, you know,

2:58:37.520 --> 2:58:42.000
 we've come a long way in being able to do that. Wolfram Alpha is kind of the consumer version of

2:58:42.000 --> 2:58:46.800
 that where you're just using natural language as input. The and it turns it into our symbolic

2:58:46.800 --> 2:58:51.520
 language. And that's, you know, the symbolic language Wolfram language is what people use

2:58:51.520 --> 2:58:56.160
 and have been using for the last 33 years. Actually, Mathematica, which is its first

2:58:56.160 --> 2:59:05.360
 instantiation, will be one third of a century old in in October. And that it's it's kind of

2:59:05.360 --> 2:59:09.920
 interesting. What do you mean one third of a century? I mean, 33 or 30? What are we? 33 and a

2:59:09.920 --> 2:59:17.440
 third. 33 and a third. So I've never heard of anyone celebrating that anniversary, but I like

2:59:17.440 --> 2:59:22.000
 it. I know. A third of a century, though, it's it's kind of get many, many slices of a century

2:59:22.000 --> 2:59:26.240
 that are interesting. But but, you know, I think that the the thing that's really striking about

2:59:26.240 --> 2:59:30.640
 that is that means, you know, including the whole sort of technology stack I built around that's

2:59:30.640 --> 2:59:34.480
 about 40 years old. And that means it's a significant fraction of the total age of the

2:59:34.480 --> 2:59:39.360
 computer industry. And it's I mean, I think it's cool that we can still run, you know,

2:59:39.360 --> 2:59:44.960
 Mathematica version one programs today and so on. And we've sort of maintained compatibility.

2:59:44.960 --> 2:59:49.760
 And we've been just building this big tower all those years of just more and more and more

2:59:49.760 --> 2:59:53.120
 computational capabilities. It's sort of interesting. We just made this this picture

2:59:54.160 --> 2:59:59.280
 of kind of the different kind of threads of of of computational content, of, you know,

2:59:59.280 --> 3:00:05.360
 mathematical content and and, you know, all sorts of things with, you know, data and graphs and

3:00:05.360 --> 3:00:10.160
 whatever else. And what you see in this picture is about the first 10 years. It's kind of like

3:00:10.160 --> 3:00:16.160
 it's just a few threads. And then then about maybe 15, 20 years ago, it kind of explodes

3:00:16.160 --> 3:00:20.400
 in this whole collection, different threads of all these different capabilities that are now

3:00:20.400 --> 3:00:25.760
 part of open language and representing different things in the world. But the thing that was super

3:00:25.760 --> 3:00:31.840
 lucky in some sense is it's all based on one idea. It's all based on the idea of symbolic expressions

3:00:31.840 --> 3:00:36.240
 and transformation rules for symbolic expressions, which was kind of what I originally

3:00:36.240 --> 3:00:42.880
 put into this SMP system back in 1979 that was a predecessor of the whole open language stack.

3:00:42.880 --> 3:00:48.880
 So that idea was an idea that I got from sort of trying to understand mathematical logic and so on.

3:00:48.880 --> 3:00:54.880
 It was my attempt to kind of make a general human comprehensible model of computation

3:00:54.880 --> 3:00:59.440
 of just everything is a symbolic expression. And all you do is transform symbolic expressions.

3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:06.960
 And, you know, in in retrospect, I was very lucky that I understood as little as I understood then,

3:01:06.960 --> 3:01:11.520
 because had I understood more, I would have been completely freaked out about all the different

3:01:11.520 --> 3:01:17.680
 ways that that kind of model can can fail. Because what do you do when you have a symbolic

3:01:17.680 --> 3:01:22.320
 expression, you make transformations for symbolic expressions? Well, for example, one question is,

3:01:22.320 --> 3:01:26.800
 there may be many transformations that could be made in a very multi computational kind of way.

3:01:26.800 --> 3:01:30.400
 But what we're doing is picking, we're using the first transformation

3:01:30.400 --> 3:01:35.840
 that applies. And we keep doing that until we reach a fixed point. And that's the result. And

3:01:35.840 --> 3:01:42.080
 that's kind of a very, it's kind of a way of sort of sliding around the edge of multi computation.

3:01:42.080 --> 3:01:46.800
 And back when I was working on SMP and things, I actually thought about these questions about

3:01:46.800 --> 3:01:52.560
 about how, you know, how, what determines the this kind of evaluation path. So for example,

3:01:52.560 --> 3:01:57.040
 you know, you work out Fibonacci, you know, Fibonacci is a recursive thing, f of n is f of

3:01:57.040 --> 3:02:02.000
 n minus one plus f of n minus two, and you get this whole tree of recursion, right? And there's

3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:06.400
 the question of how do you evaluate that tree of recursion? Do you do it sort of depth first,

3:02:06.400 --> 3:02:10.640
 where you go all the way down one side? Do you do it breadth first, where you're kind of collecting

3:02:10.640 --> 3:02:14.640
 the terms together, where you know that, you know, f of eight plus f of seven, f of seven,

3:02:14.640 --> 3:02:20.160
 plus f of six, you can collect the f of sevens, and so on. These are, you know, I didn't realize

3:02:20.160 --> 3:02:25.040
 that at the time, it's kind of funny, I was working on on gauge field theories back in 1979.

3:02:25.040 --> 3:02:31.280
 And I was also working on the evaluation model in SMP. And they're the same problem. But it took me

3:02:31.280 --> 3:02:37.120
 40 more years to realize that. And this question about how you do this sort of evaluation front,

3:02:37.120 --> 3:02:42.640
 that's a question of reference frames. It's a question of kind of the story of I mean,

3:02:42.640 --> 3:02:47.680
 that that's, that is basically this question of, in what order is the universe evaluated?

3:02:48.240 --> 3:02:52.960
 And that's, and so what you realize is, there's this whole sort of world of different kinds of

3:02:52.960 --> 3:02:57.440
 computation that you can do, sort of multi computationally. And that's a, that's an

3:02:57.440 --> 3:03:01.680
 interesting thing. It has a lot of implications for distributed computing, and so on. It also has

3:03:01.680 --> 3:03:06.400
 a potential implication for blockchain, which we haven't fully worked out, which is, and this is

3:03:06.400 --> 3:03:13.040
 not what we're doing with Cardano, but but this is a different thing. The this is something where

3:03:13.760 --> 3:03:19.840
 one of the questions is, when you have, in a sense, blockchain is a deeply sequentialized

3:03:19.840 --> 3:03:26.000
 story of time. Because in blockchain, there's just one copy of the ledger. And you're saying,

3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:29.760
 this is what happened, you know, time has progressed in this way. And there are little

3:03:29.760 --> 3:03:34.880
 things around the edges, as you try and reach consensus and so on. And, and, you know, actually,

3:03:34.880 --> 3:03:39.920
 we just recently, we've had this little conference we organized about the theory of distributed

3:03:39.920 --> 3:03:44.160
 consensus, because I realized that a bunch of interesting things that some of our science can

3:03:44.160 --> 3:03:48.000
 tell one about that. But that's a different let's let's not go down that that part. Yeah,

3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:51.520
 but distributed consensus that still has a sequential there's like, there's still

3:03:51.520 --> 3:03:57.360
 sequentiality. So don't tell me you're thinking through like how to apply multi computation to

3:03:57.360 --> 3:04:04.960
 blockchain. Yes. And so so that becomes a story of, you know, instead of transactions all having

3:04:04.960 --> 3:04:10.320
 to settle in one ledger, it's like a story of all these different ledgers. And they all have to have

3:04:10.320 --> 3:04:15.120
 some ultimate consistency, which is what causal invariance would give one, but it can take a

3:04:15.120 --> 3:04:19.920
 while. And the it can take a while is kind of like quantum mechanics. So it's kind of what's

3:04:19.920 --> 3:04:25.280
 happening is there these different paths of history that correspond to, you know, in one path

3:04:25.280 --> 3:04:29.760
 of history, you got paid this amount in another path of history, you got paid this amount. In the

3:04:29.760 --> 3:04:36.240
 end, the universe will always become consistent. Now, now the way it will it works is, okay, it's

3:04:36.240 --> 3:04:40.400
 a little bit more complicated than that. What happens is, the way space is knitted together

3:04:40.400 --> 3:04:47.040
 in our theory of physics is through all these events. And the the idea is that the way that

3:04:47.040 --> 3:04:52.880
 economic space is knitted together is between is there these autonomous events that essentially

3:04:52.880 --> 3:04:57.520
 knit together economic space. So there are all these threads of transactions that are happening.

3:04:57.520 --> 3:05:01.760
 And the question is, can they be made consistent? Are there is there something forcing them to be

3:05:01.760 --> 3:05:08.240
 sort of a consistent fabric of economic reality? And sort of what this has led me to is trying to

3:05:08.240 --> 3:05:14.640
 realize how does economics fundamentally work? And, you know, what is economics? And, you know,

3:05:14.640 --> 3:05:20.720
 what what are the atoms of economics, so to speak? And so what I've kind of realized is that, that

3:05:20.720 --> 3:05:25.920
 sort of the perhaps I don't even know if this is right yet, there's sort of events in economics,

3:05:25.920 --> 3:05:32.240
 the transactions, there are states of agents that are kind of the atoms of economics. And then

3:05:32.240 --> 3:05:38.720
 transactions are kind of agents transact in some transact in some way, and that's an event. And

3:05:38.720 --> 3:05:43.920
 then the question is, how do you knit together sort of economic space from that? What is there

3:05:43.920 --> 3:05:48.160
 in economic space? Well, all these transactions, there's a whole complicated collection of possible

3:05:48.160 --> 3:05:52.720
 transactions. But one thing that's true about economics is we tend to have the notion of a

3:05:52.720 --> 3:06:01.840
 definite value for things. We could imagine that, you know, you buy a cookie from somebody, and

3:06:02.480 --> 3:06:09.040
 they want to get a movie ticket. And there is some way that AI bots could make some path

3:06:09.680 --> 3:06:16.000
 from the cookie to the movie ticket by all these different intermediate transactions. But in fact,

3:06:16.000 --> 3:06:21.600
 we have an approximation to that, which is we say they each have a dollar value. And we have this

3:06:21.600 --> 3:06:28.240
 kind of numeraire concept of there's just a way of kind of taking this whole complicated space of

3:06:28.240 --> 3:06:34.560
 transactions and parsing it in something which is a kind of a simplified thing that is kind of like

3:06:34.560 --> 3:06:41.920
 our parsing of physical space. And so my guess is that the yet again, I mean, it's crazy that all

3:06:41.920 --> 3:06:48.160
 these things are so connected. This is another multi computation story. Another story of where

3:06:48.160 --> 3:06:54.320
 what's happening is that the economic consciousness, the economic observer is not going to deal with

3:06:54.320 --> 3:06:57.680
 all of those are different microscopic transactions. They're just going to parse the

3:06:57.680 --> 3:07:03.040
 whole thing by saying, there's this value, it's a number. And that's their understanding of their

3:07:03.040 --> 3:07:07.680
 summary of this economic network. And there will be all kinds of things like there are all kinds of

3:07:07.680 --> 3:07:13.200
 arbitrage opportunities, which are kind of like the quantum effects in this whole thing. And that's

3:07:14.000 --> 3:07:21.520
 in places where there's sort of different paths that can be followed and so on. So the question

3:07:21.520 --> 3:07:27.040
 is, can one make a sort of global theory of economics? And then my test case is again,

3:07:27.040 --> 3:07:33.520
 what is time dilation in economics? And I know if you imagine a very agricultural economics where

3:07:33.520 --> 3:07:38.000
 people are growing lettuces and fields and things like this, and you ask questions about, well,

3:07:38.000 --> 3:07:43.280
 if you're transporting lettuces to different places, what is the value of the lettuces after

3:07:43.280 --> 3:07:47.440
 you have to transport them versus if you're just sitting in one place and selling them,

3:07:47.440 --> 3:07:51.120
 you can kind of get a little bit of an analogy there. But I think there's a better and more

3:07:51.120 --> 3:07:56.080
 complete analogy. And that's the question of, is there a theory like general relativity that is a

3:07:56.080 --> 3:08:00.560
 global theory of economics? And is it about something we care about? It could be that there

3:08:00.560 --> 3:08:05.520
 is a global theory, but it's about a feature of economic reality that isn't important to us.

3:08:05.520 --> 3:08:11.040
 Now, another part of the story is, can one use those ideas to make essentially a distributed

3:08:11.040 --> 3:08:16.240
 blockchain, a distributed generalization of blockchain, kind of the quantum analog of money,

3:08:16.240 --> 3:08:21.920
 so to speak, where you have, for example, you can have uncertainty relations where you're saying,

3:08:21.920 --> 3:08:27.600
 you know, well, if I insist on knowing my bank account right now, there'll be some uncertainty.

3:08:27.600 --> 3:08:32.960
 If I'm prepared to wait a while, then it'll be much more certain. And so there's, you know,

3:08:32.960 --> 3:08:39.040
 is there a way of using and so we've made a bunch of prototypes of this, which I'm not yet happy

3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:43.280
 with. But what I realized is, to really understand these prototypes, I actually have to have a

3:08:43.280 --> 3:08:48.080
 foundational theory of economics. And so that's kind of a, you know, it may be that we could

3:08:48.080 --> 3:08:52.240
 deploy one of these prototypes as a practical system. But I think it's really going to be much

3:08:52.240 --> 3:08:56.160
 better if we actually have an understanding of how this plugs into kind of the economics.

3:08:56.160 --> 3:08:59.760
 And that means like a fundamental theory of transactions between

3:09:00.320 --> 3:09:03.760
 entities. That's what you mean by economics.

3:09:03.760 --> 3:09:08.480
 Yes, I think so. But I mean, you know, how there emerge sort of laws of economics,

3:09:08.480 --> 3:09:12.560
 I don't even know. And I've been asking friends of mine who are economists and things,

3:09:12.560 --> 3:09:17.120
 what is economics? You know, is it an axiomatic theory? Is it a theory

3:09:17.120 --> 3:09:22.480
 that is kind of a qualitative description theory? Is it, you know, what kind of a theory is it? Is

3:09:22.480 --> 3:09:27.520
 it a theory, you know, what kind of thinking? It's like in biology, in evolutionary biology,

3:09:27.520 --> 3:09:32.240
 for example, there's a certain pattern of thinking that goes on in evolutionary biology where

3:09:32.240 --> 3:09:36.720
 if you're a, you know, a good evolutionary biologist, somebody says, that creature has a

3:09:36.720 --> 3:09:41.440
 weird horn. And they'll say, well, that's because this and this and this and the selection of this

3:09:41.440 --> 3:09:46.960
 kind and that kind. And that's the story. And it's not a mathematical story. It's a story of

3:09:46.960 --> 3:09:52.080
 a different type of thinking about these things. By the way, evolutionary biology is yet another

3:09:52.080 --> 3:09:58.080
 place where it looks like this multi computational idea can be applied. And that's where maybe

3:09:58.080 --> 3:10:03.360
 speciation is related to things like event horizons. And there's a whole other kind of

3:10:03.360 --> 3:10:08.560
 world of that. But it seems like this kind of model can be applicable to so many aspects,

3:10:09.120 --> 3:10:15.840
 like the different levels of understanding of our reality. So it could be the biology,

3:10:15.840 --> 3:10:23.360
 the chemistry, at the physics level, the economics. And you could potentially, the thing is, it's like,

3:10:24.240 --> 3:10:28.800
 okay, sure, at all these levels, it might rhyme. It might make sense as a model. The question is,

3:10:28.800 --> 3:10:34.080
 can you make useful predictions as one of these levels? That's right. And that's really a question

3:10:34.080 --> 3:10:40.480
 of, you know, it's a weird situation because the situation where the model probably has definite

3:10:40.480 --> 3:10:45.040
 consequences. The question is, are they consequences we care about? Yeah. And that's

3:10:45.040 --> 3:10:55.600
 some, you know, and so in the case of, in the economic case, the, where, so, you know,

3:10:55.600 --> 3:11:02.000
 one thing is this idea of using kind of physics like notions to construct a kind of distributed

3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:07.120
 analog of blockchain. Okay. The much more pragmatic thing is a different direction.

3:11:07.120 --> 3:11:11.120
 And it has to do with this computational language that we built to describe the world

3:11:11.120 --> 3:11:15.760
 that knows about, you know, different kinds of cookies and knows about different cities and

3:11:15.760 --> 3:11:21.120
 knows about how to compute all these kinds of things. One of the things that is of interest is

3:11:21.120 --> 3:11:27.520
 if you want to run the world, you need, you know, with contracts and laws and rules and so on,

3:11:27.520 --> 3:11:33.520
 there are rules at a human level and there are kind of things like, and so this gets one into

3:11:33.520 --> 3:11:38.320
 the idea of computational contracts. You know, right now when we write a contract, it's a piece

3:11:38.320 --> 3:11:43.760
 of legalese. It's, you know, it's just written in English and it's not something that's automatically

3:11:43.760 --> 3:11:50.080
 analyzable, executable, whatever else. It's just English. You know, back in Gottfried Leibniz,

3:11:50.080 --> 3:11:57.520
 back in, you know, 1680 or whatever was like, I'm going to, you know, figure out how to use logic

3:11:57.520 --> 3:12:02.720
 to decide legal cases and so on. And he had kind of this idea of let's make a computational language

3:12:02.720 --> 3:12:09.920
 for the human law. Forget about modeling nature, forgot about natural laws. What about human law?

3:12:09.920 --> 3:12:14.880
 Can we make kind of a computational representation of that? Well, I think finally we're close to

3:12:14.880 --> 3:12:20.000
 being able to do that. And one of the projects that I hope to get to as soon as there's a little

3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:24.400
 bit of slowing down of some of this Cambrian explosion that's happening is a project I've

3:12:24.400 --> 3:12:29.040
 been meaning to really do for a long time, which is what I'm calling a symbolic discourse language.

3:12:29.040 --> 3:12:34.400
 It's just finishing the job of being able to represent everything like the conversation we're

3:12:34.400 --> 3:12:40.240
 having in computational terms. And one of the use cases for that is computational contracts.

3:12:40.240 --> 3:12:45.920
 Another use case is something like the constitution that says what the AIs, what we want the AIs to do.

3:12:45.920 --> 3:12:50.880
 So, but this is useful. So you're saying, so these are like, you're saying computational contracts,

3:12:50.880 --> 3:12:55.920
 but smart contracts. This is what's in the domain of cryptocurrency is known as smart contracts.

3:12:55.920 --> 3:13:02.240
 And so the language you've developed, this symbolic or seek to further develop symbolic discourse

3:13:02.240 --> 3:13:09.600
 language enables you to write a contract and write a contract that richly represents

3:13:10.640 --> 3:13:16.320
 some aspect of the world. So, I mean, smart contracts tend to be right now mostly about

3:13:16.320 --> 3:13:20.800
 things happening on the blockchain. And sometimes they have oracles. And in fact, our Wolfman Alpha

3:13:20.800 --> 3:13:26.160
 API is the main thing people use to get information about the real world, so to speak,

3:13:26.160 --> 3:13:31.360
 within smart contracts. So Wolfram Alpha, as it stands, is a really good oracle for

3:13:31.360 --> 3:13:34.640
 whoever wants to use it. That's perhaps where the relationship with Cardano is.

3:13:34.640 --> 3:13:37.680
 Yeah, well, that's how we started getting involved with blockchains. As we realized,

3:13:37.680 --> 3:13:43.200
 people were using Wolfram Alpha as the oracle for smart contracts, so to speak. And so that

3:13:43.200 --> 3:13:49.040
 got us interested in blockchains in general. And what was ended up happening is Wolfram Language

3:13:49.040 --> 3:13:53.760
 is, with its symbolic representation of things, is really very good at representing things like

3:13:53.760 --> 3:13:58.640
 blockchains. And so I think we now have, and we don't really know all the comparisons, but we now

3:13:58.640 --> 3:14:04.320
 have a really nice environment within Wolfram Language for dealing with the sort of, for

3:14:04.320 --> 3:14:08.240
 representing what happens in blockchains, for analyzing what happens in blockchains.

3:14:08.240 --> 3:14:15.120
 We have a whole effort in blockchain analytics. And we've sort of published some samples of how

3:14:15.120 --> 3:14:20.400
 that works. But it's because our technology stack, Wolfram Language and Mathematica,

3:14:20.400 --> 3:14:29.200
 are very widely used in the quant finance world. There's a sort of immediate coevolution there of

3:14:29.200 --> 3:14:35.200
 the quant finance kind of thing and blockchain analytics. So it's kind of the representation

3:14:35.200 --> 3:14:40.240
 of blockchain in computational language. Then ultimately, it's kind of like, how do you run

3:14:40.240 --> 3:14:45.040
 the world with code? That is, how do you write sort of all these things which are right now,

3:14:45.040 --> 3:14:50.720
 regulations and laws and contracts and things in computational language? And kind of the ultimate

3:14:50.720 --> 3:14:55.680
 vision is that sort of something happens in the world, and then there's this giant domino effect

3:14:55.680 --> 3:15:00.400
 of all these computational contracts that trigger based on the thing that happened. And there's a

3:15:00.400 --> 3:15:06.480
 whole story to that. And of course, I like to always pay attention to the latest things that

3:15:06.480 --> 3:15:11.680
 are going on. And I really, I kind of like blockchain because it's another rethinking

3:15:11.680 --> 3:15:16.240
 of kind of computation. It's kind of like cloud computing was a little bit of that, of sort of

3:15:16.240 --> 3:15:23.600
 persistent kind of computational resources and so on. And this multi computation is a big

3:15:23.600 --> 3:15:28.400
 rethinking of kind of what it means to compute. Blockchain is another bit of rethinking of what

3:15:28.400 --> 3:15:33.520
 it means to compute. The idea that you lodge kind of these autonomous lumps of computation

3:15:33.520 --> 3:15:39.200
 out there in the blockchain world. And one of the things that just sort of for fun,

3:15:39.200 --> 3:15:44.080
 so to speak, is we've been doing a bit of stuff with NFTs, and we just did some NFTs on Cardano,

3:15:44.080 --> 3:15:48.880
 and we'll be doing some more. And we did some cellular automaton NFTs on Cardano,

3:15:48.880 --> 3:15:55.120
 which people seem to like quite a bit. And one of the things I've realized about NFTs

3:15:55.120 --> 3:16:01.520
 is that there's kind of this notion, and we're really working on this, I like recording stuff.

3:16:01.520 --> 3:16:06.640
 You know, one of the things that's come out of kind of my science, I suppose, is this history

3:16:06.640 --> 3:16:11.840
 matters type story of, you know, it's not just the current state, it's the history that matters.

3:16:11.840 --> 3:16:17.120
 And I've kind of, I don't think this is actually realizing, maybe it's not coincidental that I'm

3:16:17.120 --> 3:16:20.960
 sort of the human who's recorded more about themselves than anybody else. And then I end up

3:16:20.960 --> 3:16:26.160
 with these science results that say history matters, which was not those things. I didn't

3:16:26.160 --> 3:16:30.880
 think those were connected, but they're at least correlated, yes. Yeah, right. So, you know,

3:16:30.880 --> 3:16:36.000
 this question about sort of recording what has happened and having sort of a permanent record

3:16:36.000 --> 3:16:39.840
 of things, one of the things that's kind of interesting there is, you know, you put up a

3:16:39.840 --> 3:16:43.360
 website and it's got a bunch of stuff on it, but you know, you have to keep paying the hosting

3:16:43.360 --> 3:16:48.160
 fees or the thing's going to go away. But one of the things about blockchain is quite interesting

3:16:48.160 --> 3:16:53.120
 is if you put something on a blockchain and you pay, you know, your commission to get that thing,

3:16:53.120 --> 3:16:59.120
 you know, put on, you know, mine, put on the blockchain, then in a sense, everybody who comes

3:16:59.120 --> 3:17:04.480
 after you is, you know, they are motivated to keep your thing alive because that's what keeps

3:17:04.480 --> 3:17:09.200
 the consistency of the blockchain. So in a sense with sort of the NFT world, it's kind of like if

3:17:09.200 --> 3:17:14.400
 you want to have something permanent, well, at least for the life of the blockchain, but even if

3:17:14.400 --> 3:17:18.800
 the blockchain goes out of circulation, so to speak, there's going to be enough value in that

3:17:18.800 --> 3:17:23.200
 whole collection of transactions that people are going to archive the thing. But that means that,

3:17:23.200 --> 3:17:28.400
 you know, pay once and you're kind of, you're lodged in the blockchain forever. And so we've

3:17:28.400 --> 3:17:35.280
 been kind of playing around with sort of a hobby thing of mine of thinking about sort of the NFTs

3:17:35.280 --> 3:17:41.760
 and how you and sort of the consumer idea of kind of the it's the it's the anti, you know,

3:17:41.760 --> 3:17:46.720
 it's the opposite of the Snapchat view of the world. There's a permanence to it that's heavily

3:17:46.720 --> 3:17:54.640
 incentivized and thereby you can have a permanence of history. Right. And that's that's that's kind of

3:17:54.640 --> 3:17:59.040
 the now, you know, so that's so that's one of the things we've been doing with Cardano. And it's

3:17:59.040 --> 3:18:03.360
 kind of fun. I think that I mean, this whole question about, you know, you mentioned automated

3:18:03.360 --> 3:18:08.320
 theorem proving and blockchains and so on. And as I've thought about this kind of physics inspired

3:18:08.320 --> 3:18:14.560
 distributed blockchain, obviously, there, the sort of the proof that it works, that there are no

3:18:14.560 --> 3:18:20.400
 double spends, there's no whatever else, that proof becomes a very formal kind of almost a

3:18:20.400 --> 3:18:25.440
 matter of physics, so to speak. And, you know, it's been it's been an interesting thing for the

3:18:25.440 --> 3:18:30.400
 for the practical blockchains to do kind of actual automated theorem proving. And I don't think

3:18:30.400 --> 3:18:34.880
 anybody's really managed it in an interesting case yet. It's a thing that people, you know,

3:18:34.880 --> 3:18:39.600
 aspire to. But I think it's a challenging thing because basically, the point is one of the one

3:18:39.600 --> 3:18:44.080
 of the things about proving correctness of something as well. You know, people say I've

3:18:44.080 --> 3:18:47.840
 got this program and I'm going to prove it's correct. It's like, what does that mean? You

3:18:47.840 --> 3:18:51.760
 have to say what correct means. I mean, it's it's kind of like then you have to have another

3:18:51.760 --> 3:18:56.240
 language. And people are very confused back in past decades of, you know, oh, we're going to

3:18:56.240 --> 3:19:00.960
 prove the correctness by representing the program in another language, which we also don't know

3:19:00.960 --> 3:19:06.240
 whether it's correct. And, you know, often by correctness, we just mean it can't crash or it

3:19:06.240 --> 3:19:10.640
 can't scribble on memory. But but the thing is that there's this complicated trade off,

3:19:10.640 --> 3:19:15.200
 because as soon as there's as soon as you're really using computation, you have computational

3:19:15.200 --> 3:19:20.480
 irreducibility, you have undecidability. If you want to use computation seriously,

3:19:20.480 --> 3:19:26.160
 you have to kind of let go of the idea that you're going to be able to box it in and say,

3:19:26.160 --> 3:19:30.240
 we're going to have just this happen and not anything else. I mean, this is a this is an old

3:19:30.240 --> 3:19:35.680
 fact. I mean, Gödel's theorem tries to say, you know, piano arithmetic, the axioms of arithmetic,

3:19:35.680 --> 3:19:40.400
 can you box in the integers and say these axioms give just the integers and nothing about the

3:19:40.400 --> 3:19:46.160
 integers. Gödel's theorem showed that wasn't the case. You can have all these wild, weird things

3:19:46.160 --> 3:19:50.480
 that are obey the piano axioms, but aren't integers. And there's this kind of infinite

3:19:50.480 --> 3:19:55.280
 hierarchy of additional axioms you would have to add. And it's kind of the same thing. You don't

3:19:55.280 --> 3:20:00.400
 get to, you know, if you want to say, I want to know what happens, you're boxing yourself in and

3:20:00.400 --> 3:20:05.360
 there's a limit to what can happen, so to speak. So it's a complicated trade off. And it's a big

3:20:05.360 --> 3:20:09.920
 trade off for AI, so to speak. It's kind of like, do you want to let computation actually do what

3:20:09.920 --> 3:20:14.960
 it can do? Or do you want to say, no, it's very, very boxed in to the point where we can understand

3:20:14.960 --> 3:20:21.680
 every step. And that's kind of a thing that becomes difficult to do. But that's, I mean,

3:20:21.680 --> 3:20:28.000
 in general, I would say one of the things that's kind of complicated in my sort of life and the

3:20:28.000 --> 3:20:32.960
 whole sort of story of computational language and all this technology and science and so on.

3:20:32.960 --> 3:20:38.480
 I mean, I kind of in the flow of one's life, it's sort of interesting to see how these things play

3:20:38.480 --> 3:20:43.920
 out because I've kind of concluded that I'm in the business of making kind of artifacts from the

3:20:43.920 --> 3:20:48.960
 future, which means, you know, there are things that I've done, I don't know, this physics project,

3:20:48.960 --> 3:20:52.960
 I don't know whether anybody would have gotten to it for 50 years. You know, the fact that

3:20:52.960 --> 3:20:58.160
 Mathematica is a third of a century old, and I know that a bunch of the core ideas are not

3:20:58.160 --> 3:21:02.960
 well absorbed. I mean, that is people finally got this idea that I thought was a triviality

3:21:02.960 --> 3:21:08.800
 of notebooks, that was 25 years. And, you know, some of these core ideas about symbolic computation

3:21:08.800 --> 3:21:15.680
 and so on are not absorbed. I mean, people use them every day in Wolfram language and, you know,

3:21:15.680 --> 3:21:19.920
 do all kinds of cool things with them. But if you say, what is the fundamental intellectual point

3:21:19.920 --> 3:21:25.440
 here? It's not well absorbed. And it's something where you kind of realize that you're sort of

3:21:25.440 --> 3:21:30.160
 building things. And I kind of made this thing about, you know, we're building artifacts from

3:21:30.160 --> 3:21:35.600
 the future, so to speak. And I mentioned that we have a conference coming up actually in a couple

3:21:35.600 --> 3:21:40.640
 of weeks, our annual technology conference, where we talk about all the things we're doing.

3:21:41.520 --> 3:21:46.080
 And, you know, so I was talking about it last year, about, you know, we're making artifacts

3:21:46.080 --> 3:21:50.800
 from the future. And I was kind of like, I had some version of that, that was kind of a dark

3:21:50.800 --> 3:21:54.560
 and frustrated thing of like, you know, I'm building things which nobody's going to care

3:21:54.560 --> 3:22:01.360
 about until long after I'm dead, so to speak. But then I realized, you know, people were sort of

3:22:01.360 --> 3:22:06.320
 telling me afterwards, you know, that's exactly how, you know, we're using Wolfram language in

3:22:06.320 --> 3:22:10.560
 some particular setting and, you know, some computational X field or some organization or

3:22:10.560 --> 3:22:15.440
 whatever. And it's like, people are saying, oh, you know, what did you manage to do? You know,

3:22:15.440 --> 3:22:18.480
 well, we know that in principle, it will be possible to do that. But we didn't know that

3:22:18.480 --> 3:22:23.280
 was possible now. And it's kind of like, that's sort of the business we're in. And in a sense,

3:22:23.280 --> 3:22:27.760
 with some of these ideas in science, you know, I feel a little bit the same way that there are

3:22:27.760 --> 3:22:35.040
 some of these things where, you know, some things like, for example, this whole idea, well, so to

3:22:35.040 --> 3:22:39.440
 relate to another sort of piece of history and the future, one of, you know, I mentioned at the

3:22:39.440 --> 3:22:44.560
 beginning kind of complexity as this thing that I was interested in back 40 years ago and so on.

3:22:44.560 --> 3:22:50.080
 Where does complexity come from? Well, I think we kind of nailed that. The answer is in the

3:22:50.080 --> 3:22:54.880
 computational universe, even simple programs make it. And that's kind of the secret that nature has

3:22:54.880 --> 3:23:02.160
 that allows you to make it. So that's that part. But the bigger picture there was this idea of

3:23:02.160 --> 3:23:06.640
 this kind of computational paradigm, the idea that you could go beyond mathematical equations,

3:23:06.640 --> 3:23:13.040
 which have been sort of the primary modeling medium for 300 years. And so it was like, look,

3:23:13.040 --> 3:23:18.160
 it is inexorably the case that people will use programs rather than just equations. And, you

3:23:18.160 --> 3:23:22.720
 know, I was saying that in the 1980s and people were, you know, I published my big book, New Kind

3:23:22.720 --> 3:23:28.880
 of Science, that'll be 20 years ago next year. So in 2002, and people were saying, oh, no,

3:23:28.880 --> 3:23:32.960
 this can't possibly be true. You know, we know for 300 years we've been doing all this stuff.

3:23:32.960 --> 3:23:38.480
 Right. To be fair, I now realize I'm a little bit more analysis of what people actually

3:23:38.480 --> 3:23:44.000
 said in pretty much every field other than physics. People said, oh, these are new models.

3:23:44.000 --> 3:23:48.640
 That's pretty interesting. In physics, people were like, we've got our physics models. We're

3:23:48.640 --> 3:23:53.040
 very happy with them. Yeah, in physics, there's more resistance because of the attachment and

3:23:53.040 --> 3:23:58.000
 the power of the equations. The idea that programs might be the right way to approach

3:23:59.200 --> 3:24:05.120
 this field. Was there some resistance? And like you're saying, it takes time. For somebody who

3:24:05.120 --> 3:24:09.520
 likes the idea of time dilation and all these applications, I thought you would understand this.

3:24:09.520 --> 3:24:14.480
 Yeah, right. But, you know, and computational irreducibility. Yes, exactly. But I mean,

3:24:14.480 --> 3:24:20.160
 it is really interesting that just 20 years, a span of 20 years, it's gone from, you know,

3:24:20.160 --> 3:24:28.240
 pitchforks and horror to, yeah, we get it. And, you know, it's helped that we've, you know, in our

3:24:28.240 --> 3:24:32.560
 current effort in fundamental physics, we've gotten a lot further and we've managed to

3:24:33.200 --> 3:24:37.680
 put a lot of puzzle pieces together that make sense. But the thing that I've been thinking

3:24:37.680 --> 3:24:43.600
 about recently is this field of complexity. So I've kind of was a sort of a field builder.

3:24:43.600 --> 3:24:50.320
 Back in the 1980s, I was kind of like, okay, you know, can we, you know, I'd understood this point

3:24:50.320 --> 3:24:54.320
 that there was this sort of fundamental phenomenon of complexity that showed up in lots of places.

3:24:54.320 --> 3:25:01.360
 And I was like, this is an interesting sort of field of science. And I was recently was reminded,

3:25:01.360 --> 3:25:07.360
 I was at this, the very first sort of get together of what became the Santa Fe Institute. And I was

3:25:07.360 --> 3:25:11.440
 like, in fact, there's even an audio recording of me sort of saying, people have been talking about,

3:25:11.440 --> 3:25:16.000
 oh, what should this, you know, outfit do? And I was saying, well, there is this thing that I've

3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:21.520
 been thinking about. It's this kind of idea of complexity. And it's kind of like, and that's

3:25:21.520 --> 3:25:25.520
 what that ended up. And you planted the seed of complexity at Santa Fe. That's beautiful.

3:25:25.520 --> 3:25:31.120
 It's a beautiful vision. But I mean, so that, but what's happened then is this idea of complexity

3:25:31.120 --> 3:25:35.920
 and, you know, and I started the first research center at University of Illinois for doing that

3:25:35.920 --> 3:25:42.640
 in the first journal, complex systems and so on. And it's kind of an interesting thing in my life,

3:25:42.640 --> 3:25:47.680
 at least that it's kind of like you plant the seed, you have this idea. It's a kind of a science

3:25:47.680 --> 3:25:52.960
 idea. You have this idea of sort of focusing on the phenomenon of complexity. The deeper idea was

3:25:52.960 --> 3:25:58.480
 this computational paradigm. But the nominal idea is this kind of idea of complexity. Okay. Then you

3:25:58.480 --> 3:26:05.520
 roll time forward 30 years or whatever, 35 years, whatever it is. And you say, what happened? Okay.

3:26:05.520 --> 3:26:10.080
 Well now there are a thousand complexity institutes around the world. I think more or less,

3:26:10.080 --> 3:26:15.120
 we've been trying to count them. And, you know, there are 40 complexity journals, I think.

3:26:16.160 --> 3:26:22.160
 And so it's kind of like what actually happened in this field, right? And I look at a lot of what

3:26:22.160 --> 3:26:28.160
 happened and I'm like, you know, I have to admit to some eye rolling, so to speak, because it's

3:26:28.160 --> 3:26:33.360
 kind of like, like, what is, what's actually going on? Well, what people definitely got

3:26:33.360 --> 3:26:38.240
 was this idea of computational models. And then they got, but they thought one of the,

3:26:38.240 --> 3:26:42.720
 one of the kind of cognitive mistakes, I think is they say, we've got a computational model

3:26:43.200 --> 3:26:49.600
 and it, and we're looking at a system that's complex and our computational model gives

3:26:49.600 --> 3:26:55.920
 complexity. By golly, that must mean it's right. And unfortunately, because complexity is a generic

3:26:55.920 --> 3:27:01.120
 phenomenon and computational irreducibility is a generic phenomenon that actually tells you nothing.

3:27:01.120 --> 3:27:06.240
 And so then the question is, well, what can you do? You know, there's a lot of things that have

3:27:06.240 --> 3:27:10.560
 been sort of done under this banner of complexity. And I think it's been very successful in providing

3:27:10.560 --> 3:27:15.200
 sort of an interdisciplinary way of connecting different fields together. Which is powerful

3:27:15.200 --> 3:27:19.440
 in itself. Right. I mean, that's a very useful. Biology and economics and physics. Right. It's a

3:27:19.440 --> 3:27:23.760
 good organizing principle, but in the end, a lot of that is around this sort of computational

3:27:23.760 --> 3:27:28.960
 paradigm, computational modeling. That's the raw material that powers that kind of, that kind of

3:27:28.960 --> 3:27:33.360
 correspondence, I think. But the question is sort of, what is the, you know, I was just thinking

3:27:33.360 --> 3:27:38.960
 recently, you know, we've been, I mean, the other we've been, we've been for years, people have

3:27:38.960 --> 3:27:43.440
 told me you should start some Wolfram Institute that does basic science. You know, all I have

3:27:43.440 --> 3:27:47.920
 is a company that, that builds software and we, you know, we have a little piece that does basic

3:27:47.920 --> 3:27:52.480
 science as kind of a hobby. People are saying you should start this Wolfram Institute thing.

3:27:52.480 --> 3:27:56.000
 And I've been, you know, cause I've known about lots of institutes and I've seen kind of their

3:27:56.000 --> 3:28:00.240
 flow of money and, and kind of, you know, what happens in different situations and so on. So I've

3:28:00.240 --> 3:28:05.120
 been kind of reluctant, but, but I've, I've, I have realized that, you know, what we've done with

3:28:05.120 --> 3:28:10.720
 our company over the last 35 years, you know, we built a very good machine for doing R and D and,

3:28:10.720 --> 3:28:16.000
 you know, innovating and creating things. And I just applied that machine to the physics project.

3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:20.080
 That's how we did the physics project in a fairly short amount of time with a, you know,

3:28:20.080 --> 3:28:25.840
 a efficient machine with, you know, various people involved and so on. And so, you know,

3:28:25.840 --> 3:28:31.040
 it, it works for basic science and it's like, we can do more of this. And so now.

3:28:31.040 --> 3:28:34.480
 In biology and chemistry, so it's, it's become an institute.

3:28:34.480 --> 3:28:36.160
 Yes. Well, it needs to become an institute.

3:28:36.160 --> 3:28:37.280
 An official institute.

3:28:37.280 --> 3:28:41.600
 Right. Right. But the, the thing that, so I was thinking about, okay, so what do we do with

3:28:41.600 --> 3:28:46.240
 complexity? You know, what, what, there are all these people who've, you know, what, what should

3:28:46.240 --> 3:28:50.800
 happen to that field? And what I realized is there's kind of this area of foundations of

3:28:50.800 --> 3:28:56.160
 complexity. That's about these questions about simple programs, what they do that's far away

3:28:56.160 --> 3:29:00.000
 from a bunch of the detailed applications that people, it's not far away. It's, it's the,

3:29:00.000 --> 3:29:05.040
 it's the under, you know, the, the bedrock underneath those applications. And so I realized

3:29:05.040 --> 3:29:12.160
 recently, this is my recent kind of little innovation of a sort, a post that I'll do very

3:29:12.160 --> 3:29:20.400
 soon about kind of, you know, the foundations of complexity. What really are they? I think

3:29:20.400 --> 3:29:26.480
 there are really two ideas, two conceptual ideas that I hadn't really enunciated, I think before.

3:29:26.480 --> 3:29:31.440
 One is what I call meta modeling. The other is ruleology. So what is meta modeling? So

3:29:31.440 --> 3:29:36.000
 meta modeling is you've got this complicated model and it's a model of, you know, hedgehogs

3:29:36.000 --> 3:29:40.720
 interacting with this, interacting with that. And the question is what's really underneath that?

3:29:40.720 --> 3:29:45.600
 What is it? You know, is it a Turing machine? Is it a cellular automaton? You know,

3:29:45.600 --> 3:29:51.120
 what is the underlying stuff underneath that model? And so there's this kind of meta science

3:29:51.120 --> 3:29:56.560
 question of given these models, what is the core model? And I realized, I mean, to me,

3:29:56.560 --> 3:30:00.880
 that's sort of an obvious question, but then I realized I've been doing language design for 40

3:30:00.880 --> 3:30:05.120
 years and language design is exactly that question. You know, underneath all of this

3:30:05.120 --> 3:30:10.080
 detailed stuff people do, what are the underlying primitives? And that's a question people haven't

3:30:10.080 --> 3:30:13.920
 tended to ask about models. They say, well, we've got this nice model for this and that and the

3:30:13.920 --> 3:30:18.640
 other, what's really underneath it? And what, you know, because once you have the thing that's

3:30:18.640 --> 3:30:24.000
 underneath it, well, for example, this multi computation idea is an ultimate meta modeling

3:30:24.000 --> 3:30:29.680
 idea because it's saying underneath all these fields is one kind of paradigmatic structure.

3:30:29.680 --> 3:30:36.240
 And, you know, you can imagine the same kind of thing in much more sort of much sort of shallower

3:30:36.240 --> 3:30:41.760
 levels in different kinds of modeling. So the first activity is this kind of meta modeling,

3:30:41.760 --> 3:30:47.920
 the kind of the models about models, so to speak. You know, what is the, what's, you know,

3:30:47.920 --> 3:30:53.200
 drilling down into models? That's one thing. The other thing is this thing that I think we're

3:30:53.200 --> 3:30:57.840
 going to call ruleology, which is kind of the, okay, you've got these simple rules. You've got

3:30:57.840 --> 3:31:01.600
 cellular automata, you've got turing machines, you've got substitution systems, you've got

3:31:01.600 --> 3:31:06.160
 register machines, you've got all these different things. What do they actually do in the wild? And

3:31:06.160 --> 3:31:10.880
 this is an area that I've spent a lot of time, you know, working on. It's a lot of stuff in my new

3:31:10.880 --> 3:31:16.160
 kind of science book is about this. You know, this new book I wrote about combinators is full of

3:31:16.160 --> 3:31:21.840
 stuff like this. And this journal Complex Systems has lots of papers about these kinds of things.

3:31:21.840 --> 3:31:26.240
 But there isn't really a home for people who do ruleology or what I'm now...

3:31:26.240 --> 3:31:29.520
 As you call the basic science of rules.

3:31:29.520 --> 3:31:35.120
 Yes. Yes. Right. So it's like, you've got some, what is it? Is it mathematics? No,

3:31:35.120 --> 3:31:38.960
 it isn't really like mathematics. In fact, from my now understanding of metamathematics,

3:31:38.960 --> 3:31:43.760
 I understand that it's the molecular dynamics level. It's not the level that mathematicians

3:31:43.760 --> 3:31:48.400
 have traditionally cared about. It's not computer science because computer science is about writing

3:31:48.400 --> 3:31:53.760
 programs that do things, you know, that were for a purpose, not programs in the wild, so to speak.

3:31:53.760 --> 3:31:57.600
 It's not physics. It doesn't have anything to do with, you know, maybe underneath some physics,

3:31:57.600 --> 3:32:02.720
 but it's not physics as such. So it just hasn't had a home. And if you look at, you know,

3:32:02.720 --> 3:32:08.480
 but what's great about it is it's a surviving field, so to speak. It's something where,

3:32:08.480 --> 3:32:13.360
 you know, one of the things I find sort of inspiring about mathematics, for example,

3:32:13.360 --> 3:32:18.240
 is you look at mathematics that was done, you know, in ancient Greece, ancient, you know, Babylon,

3:32:18.240 --> 3:32:23.360
 Egypt, and so on. It's still here today. You know, you find an icosahedron that somebody made

3:32:23.360 --> 3:32:28.640
 in ancient Egypt. You look at it. Oh, that's a very modern thing. It's an icosahedron. You know,

3:32:28.640 --> 3:32:34.560
 it's a timeless kind of activity. And this idea of studying simple rules and what they do,

3:32:34.560 --> 3:32:39.920
 it's a timeless activity. And I can see that over the last 40 years or so as, you know,

3:32:39.920 --> 3:32:44.800
 even with cellular automata, it's kind of like, you know, you can sort of catalog what are the

3:32:44.800 --> 3:32:50.400
 different cellular automata used for and, you know, like the simplest rules like one, you might

3:32:50.400 --> 3:32:56.640
 even know this one, Rule 184. Rule 184 is a minimal model for road traffic flow. And, you know, it's

3:32:56.640 --> 3:33:01.120
 also a minimal model for various other things. But it's kind of fun that you can literally say,

3:33:01.120 --> 3:33:07.600
 you know, Rule 90 is a minimal model for this and this and this. Rule 4 is a minimal model for this.

3:33:07.600 --> 3:33:13.200
 And it's kind of remarkable that you can just by in this raw level of this kind of study of rules,

3:33:13.200 --> 3:33:17.840
 they then branch, they're the raw material that you can use to make models of different things.

3:33:17.840 --> 3:33:23.200
 So it's a very pure basic science, but it's one that, you know, people have explored it,

3:33:23.200 --> 3:33:27.040
 but they've been kind of a little bit in the wilderness. And I think, you know, one of the

3:33:27.040 --> 3:33:32.720
 things that I would like to do finally is, you know, I always thought that sort of this notion

3:33:32.720 --> 3:33:40.800
 of pure NKS, pure NKS being the acronym for my book, New Kind of Science, was something that

3:33:40.800 --> 3:33:44.640
 people should be doing. And, you know, we tried to figure out what's the right institutional

3:33:44.640 --> 3:33:48.720
 structure to do this stuff. You know, we dealt with a bunch of universities. Oh, you know,

3:33:48.720 --> 3:33:53.040
 can we do this here? Well, what department would be in it? Well, it isn't in a department. It's

3:33:53.040 --> 3:33:57.440
 its own new kind of thing. That's why the book was called The New Kind of Science.

3:33:58.240 --> 3:34:03.040
 It's kind of the, because that's an increasingly good description of what it is, so to speak.

3:34:03.040 --> 3:34:08.480
 We're actually, we were thinking about kind of the ruleological society because we're realizing

3:34:08.480 --> 3:34:14.080
 that it's kind of, it's, you know, it's very interesting. I mean, I've never really done

3:34:14.080 --> 3:34:18.080
 something like this before because there's this whole group of researchers who are,

3:34:18.080 --> 3:34:24.080
 who've been doing things that are really, in some cases, very elegant, very surviving, very solid,

3:34:24.080 --> 3:34:28.640
 you know, here's this thing that happens in this very abstract system. But it's like,

3:34:29.280 --> 3:34:34.880
 it's like, what is that part of, you know, it doesn't have a home. And I think that's something

3:34:34.880 --> 3:34:38.800
 I, you know, I kind of fault myself for not having been more, you know, when complexity

3:34:38.800 --> 3:34:46.400
 was developing in the 80s, I didn't understand the danger of applications. That is, it's really

3:34:46.400 --> 3:34:50.480
 cool that you can apply this to economics and you can apply it to evolutionary biology and this and

3:34:50.480 --> 3:34:54.560
 that and the other. But what happens with applications is everything gets sucked into

3:34:54.560 --> 3:34:59.520
 the applications. And the pure stuff, it's like the pure mathematics, there isn't any pure

3:34:59.520 --> 3:35:05.600
 mathematics, so to speak. It's all just applications of mathematics. And I failed to kind of make sure

3:35:05.600 --> 3:35:12.880
 that this kind of pure area was kind of maintained and developed. And I think now, you know, one of

3:35:12.880 --> 3:35:17.280
 the things I want to try to do and, you know, it's a funny thing because I'm used to, look,

3:35:17.280 --> 3:35:22.960
 I've been a tech CEO for more than half my life now. So, you know, this is what I know how to do.

3:35:22.960 --> 3:35:28.400
 And, you know, I can make stuff happen and get projects to happen, even as it turns out,

3:35:28.400 --> 3:35:34.880
 basic science projects in that kind of setting and how that translates into kind of, you know,

3:35:34.880 --> 3:35:38.160
 there are a lot of people working on, for example, our physics project sort of distributed through

3:35:38.160 --> 3:35:42.800
 the academic world and that's working just great. But the question is, you know, can we have a sort

3:35:42.800 --> 3:35:49.200
 of accelerator mechanism that makes use of kind of what we've learned in sort of R&D innovation?

3:35:49.200 --> 3:35:54.080
 And, you know, but on the other hand, it's a funny thing because, you know, in a company,

3:35:54.080 --> 3:35:58.480
 in the end, the thing is, you know, it's a company, it makes products, it sells things,

3:35:58.480 --> 3:36:03.360
 sells things to people. And, you know, when you're doing basic research, one of the challenges is

3:36:03.360 --> 3:36:09.840
 there isn't that same kind of sort of mechanism. And so it's, you know, how do you drive the thing

3:36:09.840 --> 3:36:16.000
 in a kind of, in a led kind of way so that it really can make forward progress rather than,

3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:20.000
 you know, what can often happen in, you know, in academic settings where it's like,

3:36:20.000 --> 3:36:24.160
 well, there are all these flowers blooming, but it's not clear that, you know, that it's...

3:36:24.160 --> 3:36:29.520
 You have to have a central mission and a drive, just like you do with a company that's delivering

3:36:29.520 --> 3:36:34.320
 a big overarching product. And that's... But the challenge is, you know, when you have

3:36:35.600 --> 3:36:40.320
 the economics of the world are such that, you know, when you're delivering a product and people

3:36:40.320 --> 3:36:44.880
 say, wow, that's useful, we'll buy it. And then that kind of feeds back and, okay, then you can

3:36:45.680 --> 3:36:51.600
 pay the people who build it to eat, you know, so they can eat and so on. And with basic science,

3:36:52.400 --> 3:36:57.440
 the payoff is very much less visible. And, you know, with this physics project, as I say,

3:36:57.440 --> 3:37:02.320
 the big surprise has been that, I mean, you know, for example, well, the big surprise with

3:37:02.320 --> 3:37:07.920
 the physics project is that it looks like it has near term applications. And I was like,

3:37:07.920 --> 3:37:13.840
 I'm guessing this is 200 years away. I was kind of using the analogy of, you know, Newton

3:37:14.720 --> 3:37:18.400
 starting a satellite launch company, which would have been kind of wrong time.

3:37:19.360 --> 3:37:24.880
 And, you know, but it turns out that's not the case, but we can't guarantee that. And if you say

3:37:24.880 --> 3:37:31.600
 we're signing up to do basic research, basic rheology, let's say, and, you know, and we can't,

3:37:31.600 --> 3:37:36.000
 we don't know the horizon, you know, it's an unknown horizon. It's kind of like an undecidable

3:37:36.000 --> 3:37:40.160
 kind of proposition of when is this proof going to end, so to speak? When is it going to be

3:37:40.160 --> 3:37:48.720
 something that gets applied? Well, I hope this becomes a vibrant new field of rheology. I love

3:37:48.720 --> 3:37:55.120
 it. Like I told you many, many times, it's one of the most amazing ideas that has been brought to

3:37:55.120 --> 3:38:03.040
 this world. So I hope you get a bunch of people to explore this world. Thank you once again for

3:38:03.040 --> 3:38:09.440
 spending your really valuable time with me today. Fun stuff. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this

3:38:09.440 --> 3:38:14.080
 conversation with Stephen Wolfram. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the

3:38:14.080 --> 3:38:21.280
 description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Richard Feynman. Nature uses only the

3:38:21.280 --> 3:38:28.400
 longest threads to weave her patterns, so each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization

3:38:28.400 --> 3:38:45.360
 of the entire tapestry. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
