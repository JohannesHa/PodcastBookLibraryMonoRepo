 The following is a conversation with Anthony Pompliano, entrepreneur, technology

00:04.960 --> 00:10.480
 investor, prolific writer, podcaster, and Twitter user on topics of finance,

00:10.480 --> 00:13.040
 cryptocurrency, technology, and economics.

00:13.560 --> 00:19.680
 I highly recommend his popular podcast and daily letter called The Pump

00:19.760 --> 00:21.760
 Podcast and The Pump Letter.

00:35.200 --> 00:39.600
 As a side note, let me say that I'll be having many conversations in the coming

00:39.600 --> 00:44.240
 months about cryptocurrency with people of all kinds of backgrounds and worldviews.

00:44.960 --> 00:50.080
 Those who are proponents of Bitcoin, like Anthony, Nick Carter, Robert

00:50.080 --> 00:53.040
 Breedlove, Alex Glastine, and many others.

00:53.040 --> 00:57.560
 And those who are proponents of other cryptocurrency technologies, like Vitalik

00:57.560 --> 01:02.360
 Buterin, Charles Hoskinson, Richard Hart, Sergey Nazarov, Silvia

01:02.360 --> 01:04.240
 Macaulay, and many others as well.

01:04.960 --> 01:06.920
 I'm not framing this as a debate.

01:07.200 --> 01:12.680
 I'm simply looking to explore exciting ideas in the space of technologies that

01:12.680 --> 01:18.000
 could very well change human civilization and AGI civilization as well.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.200
 I appreciate that some communities are a bit more intense in their style

01:22.200 --> 01:26.760
 of communication and others, but I personally am only interested in open

01:26.760 --> 01:30.480
 minded, respectful collaboration in exploring ideas.

01:31.200 --> 01:36.640
 I personally try to like to approach conversations by considering that I may

01:36.640 --> 01:40.400
 be wrong about everything and I'm looking to learn.

01:41.200 --> 01:46.560
 I won't engage in groupthink, social signaling, outrage mobs, mocking,

01:46.560 --> 01:50.920
 and derision. If you do, I understand, it's just not my thing.

01:51.560 --> 01:56.800
 I send you my love either way and hope to meet you in person or some drinks, some

01:56.800 --> 01:59.760
 good laughs, and a good conversation one day.

02:00.160 --> 02:04.560
 No matter the difference in style or substance, we're all just human after all.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.680
 This is an amazing ride we're all on together.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.680
 Buy the ticket, take the ride, as Hunter S.

02:10.680 --> 02:15.560
 Thompson said, whether you pay for that ticket with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or

02:15.560 --> 02:21.080
 the dollar, gold, seashells, a beer, or just a good old smile.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.280
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

02:24.320 --> 02:28.280
 And here is my conversation with Anthony Pampliano.

02:29.480 --> 02:35.000
 You served in the US Army for six years and spent 13 months in Iraq in 2008 and

02:35.000 --> 02:40.080
 2009. Can you tell the story of why you joined the army and what were some of

02:40.080 --> 02:43.960
 the moving difficulties, maybe lasting experiences from the time you served?

02:43.960 --> 02:50.200
 Sure. I joined when I was 17 years old, needed my parents to basically sign in

02:50.200 --> 02:55.240
 order to join. And I graduated a semester early from high school and thought I was

02:55.240 --> 02:58.200
 going to go play football in college and kind of enroll in the spring semester.

02:58.200 --> 03:02.440
 And when that didn't happen, basically was working at Chick Fil A and Quiznos.

03:02.440 --> 03:07.400
 And I had in my mind, look, this is probably not the path in life that I want.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.200
 And so I knew I was going to go to college.

03:09.200 --> 03:12.080
 I knew I was going to go play football in the fall, but I had this window of time

03:12.080 --> 03:17.000
 and so I walked into a recruiting office and just basically was like, I'm assuming

03:17.000 --> 03:17.840
 you guys need some help.

03:18.360 --> 03:22.040
 And, uh, you know, they gave me the whole pitch and, uh, you know, give you a signing

03:22.040 --> 03:24.800
 bonus, you can go jump out of planes and go do all this crazy stuff.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.600
 I just said, okay, let's do it.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.360
 This was, this was close to the 9 11.

03:29.400 --> 03:33.520
 This was in 2006, about five years after.

03:33.520 --> 03:36.400
 So what impact, I mean, do you remember 9 11?

03:36.400 --> 03:38.600
 What impact did that have on your thinking about this?

03:38.600 --> 03:42.520
 So I was, uh, in eighth grade, um, if I remember correctly.

03:42.560 --> 03:48.640
 And, uh, I remember, uh, being in school when it happened and, uh, I walked into a

03:48.640 --> 03:54.080
 classroom and the entire class, uh, somebody else's class, they were all talking to the

03:54.080 --> 03:54.720
 teacher about something.

03:54.720 --> 03:57.680
 The second that me and a couple other kids walked in and we got real quiet and the

03:57.680 --> 03:59.360
 teacher was like, Hey, go back to your like, homeroom.

04:00.160 --> 04:02.360
 And so it was just kind of a weird, like what's going on.

04:02.720 --> 04:06.080
 Uh, and then next thing I know, they called all the students into the cafeteria.

04:06.080 --> 04:10.160
 And this is back before, you know, every classroom really had a television in it and,

04:10.160 --> 04:11.680
 you know, cable and all that kind of stuff.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.760
 And so when we were there, they basically just said, listen, there's been this, uh,

04:14.800 --> 04:16.120
 event that's occurred.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.520
 All of your parents are going to come pick you guys up and, uh, they'll explain it to

04:19.520 --> 04:19.800
 you.

04:20.280 --> 04:25.200
 And so to, you know, a kid in eighth grade, you're basically like, what happened?

04:25.280 --> 04:29.080
 And so I got home and, uh, and I remember talking to my dad about it and my dad

04:29.080 --> 04:33.640
 basically gave me, you know, the, uh, the core American kind of talking points.

04:33.640 --> 04:38.240
 Right. Look, somebody from another country came here and tried to kill Americans and

04:38.240 --> 04:39.480
 was successful in doing that.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.440
 Um, and to some extent he just said, and I'm willing to bet, you know, we're going

04:44.440 --> 04:45.240
 to go back after them.

04:45.320 --> 04:48.880
 Did that wake you up a little bit to the idea that there's evil out there that, you

04:48.880 --> 04:53.520
 know, even just the idea of terrorism for many people that was, um, when it hits you

04:53.520 --> 04:59.600
 on your own land, it's a, it really shakes up your mind in some sense, world war two.

04:59.600 --> 05:04.400
 That's why world war two was fundamentally different for Americans than it is for the

05:04.400 --> 05:10.960
 people like in Russia and England and France and, uh, in Europe in general is

05:11.680 --> 05:17.200
 there's something about when there's a families, women, children dying on your own

05:17.200 --> 05:19.240
 land, that's different.

05:19.880 --> 05:24.480
 And that was one of the first times in America where like on your, uh, of course

05:24.480 --> 05:29.880
 it's Pearl Harbor, but like, this is like in recent history, it's like, they hit us

05:29.960 --> 05:33.680
 here, that was like a profound idea.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.720
 I think America was very, very good at exporting the violence

05:36.720 --> 05:38.040
 elsewhere for a long time.

05:38.240 --> 05:43.160
 And, uh, there was this element of, uh, complacency, but also this element of,

05:43.160 --> 05:47.280
 uh, um, you know, really just American superiority that doesn't happen here.

05:47.440 --> 05:47.920
 Right.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.840
 And, uh, I think that that woke people up, not only to, uh, you know, to the

05:52.840 --> 05:56.920
 idea that other places around the world may not like the American ideals, may not

05:56.920 --> 06:02.240
 like democracy and capitalism and, and that, but also, uh, maybe we aren't as

06:02.240 --> 06:04.640
 big, tough and secure as we thought we were.

06:04.920 --> 06:05.280
 Right.

06:05.280 --> 06:08.640
 And so obviously I think you see the kind of the over rotation with a lot of the

06:08.640 --> 06:12.280
 kind of security theater that came after that of almost psychologically, let's

06:12.280 --> 06:15.880
 make our citizens feel like they're safe, even if the things that we're doing

06:15.880 --> 06:18.400
 don't necessarily, you know, kind of change that apparatus.

06:18.840 --> 06:22.760
 Uh, but on top of that, I think it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's

06:22.760 --> 06:27.760
 I think that it really woke people up to, uh, extremism around the world.

06:27.760 --> 06:32.120
 And, uh, I don't know if necessarily there was a change in the extremism as

06:32.120 --> 06:34.440
 much as it just was an awareness thing, right.

06:34.440 --> 06:39.120
 How, how many people, you know, kind of drew a line from, was it 92 or 93 with

06:39.120 --> 06:44.000
 the world trade center bombing to, you know, deep levels of extremism and hatred

06:44.000 --> 06:49.040
 of, uh, kind of the American industrial complex, probably not that many, 2001,

06:49.360 --> 06:50.040
 a lot of people.

06:50.040 --> 06:53.200
 And so I think that was, you know, again, as a, as a young kid, you don't

06:53.200 --> 06:54.280
 understand a lot of this stuff.

06:54.280 --> 06:58.480
 You basically just, Hey, somebody came here and tried to kill Americans.

06:58.480 --> 07:01.280
 And so, you know, we should go fight back, right.

07:01.280 --> 07:03.600
 Was kind of the, uh, the, the response I think that I had.

07:03.800 --> 07:09.280
 What role did that have psychologically for you when you then in 2006 join the

07:09.280 --> 07:15.480
 army, I mean, this is a very different joining the army than in the time when

07:15.480 --> 07:20.320
 like it's more peaceful here, you're essentially facing, I mean, I don't

07:20.320 --> 07:23.040
 know if you see it that way, but you know, there is a war on terror.

07:23.040 --> 07:27.400
 And I know that people kind of, uh, criticize that whole formulation

07:27.400 --> 07:31.080
 framework of thinking, but nevertheless, you are going to Iraq.

07:31.080 --> 07:35.000
 You are going to Afghanistan, you're going to these places and are

07:35.000 --> 07:40.280
 fighting these complicated, like, I mean, it's not even clear what you're fighting.

07:40.520 --> 07:40.800
 Yeah.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.480
 Well, I think that there's a couple of key pieces, right?

07:43.480 --> 07:47.560
 So one, like what the actual most impactful data points, if you were, or

07:47.560 --> 07:50.080
 kind of stories for me, uh, was the Pat Tillman story.

07:50.160 --> 07:53.720
 So I played football, uh, in high school and it was going to go play in college.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.640
 Um, and seeing, you know, this NFL player who basically just one day said, Hey, I'm

07:58.640 --> 08:01.640
 going to go and do this instead, uh, and walk away.

08:01.880 --> 08:06.480
 I don't know necessarily if it was a, uh, I want to pursue the same story right now.

08:06.480 --> 08:07.800
 So he ended up dying.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.760
 And so not exactly the, uh, the end result that you want, but I think it

08:10.760 --> 08:13.360
 was almost like, uh, he made it okay.

08:13.560 --> 08:17.240
 If you were on a certain trajectory in life to go take this detour and,

08:17.280 --> 08:18.040
 and to go do it.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.440
 Um, but the second thing is I was 17.

08:20.840 --> 08:23.240
 You're pretty stupid when you're 17, you're pretty naive when you're 17.

08:23.280 --> 08:23.560
 Right.

08:23.920 --> 08:28.560
 And so, uh, I almost, um, kind of backed into the deployment because

08:28.560 --> 08:31.680
 I signed up, uh, as a, uh, a reserve member.

08:32.040 --> 08:34.840
 And so basically the plan was to sign up for the reserves.

08:34.840 --> 08:37.600
 I was going to go to basic training, get all the, you know, kind of education

08:37.600 --> 08:41.040
 and qualification, I was going to go to college and then after college,

08:41.040 --> 08:44.440
 you know, maybe there's a chance that you will go and serve or do whatever.

08:45.080 --> 08:48.400
 For me, I ended up getting deployed when I was a junior in college

08:48.400 --> 08:49.800
 and we got pulled out of school.

08:50.200 --> 08:54.040
 And so at 20 years old, uh, it's not exactly what you thought you were

08:54.040 --> 08:54.960
 signing up for, right.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.280
 Especially to kind of leave school to go do it.

08:57.720 --> 09:01.760
 And then on top of that, uh, I probably had an advantage over most people, both

09:01.760 --> 09:06.880
 on the entry to combat and the exit to, uh, kind of a combat situation, which

09:06.880 --> 09:07.920
 that was football.

09:08.280 --> 09:13.560
 So I always explain that, um, in hindsight, you're in a male dominated

09:13.560 --> 09:17.720
 testosterone driven kind of combative sport where it's us first them.

09:17.720 --> 09:21.520
 And, and, uh, there's training and, and, uh, you know, injuries and just kind of

09:21.520 --> 09:25.400
 all of the things that go into playing a combat sport like football to now they

09:25.400 --> 09:28.600
 give you guns, but you still have a uniform on still male dominated.

09:28.920 --> 09:32.200
 It's just a little bit, you know, more serious in terms of the injuries and,

09:32.200 --> 09:36.400
 and, uh, potential deaths and things like that, but also on the exit from that

09:36.400 --> 09:40.600
 deployment, most guys I was there with, they're going back to being, you know,

09:40.720 --> 09:45.800
 prison guards, police officers working at the lumber yard, you know, just kind

09:45.800 --> 09:48.080
 of every day Americans.

09:48.520 --> 09:53.320
 And so I had the fortunate ability to go back into, uh, kind of that combative

09:53.320 --> 09:54.800
 environment, go back to play football.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.800
 And so it was almost this like deescalation on the way out, uh, where

09:58.840 --> 09:59.600
 they take your guns away.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.840
 We still got a uniform, still male dominated, uh, still combative.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.680
 And then eventually you're just a normal citizen.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.640
 And so I think that in some weird way, I was, you know, very fortunate

10:07.640 --> 10:11.000
 to kind of on the entry and exit, have that experience where other guys did.

10:11.600 --> 10:17.720
 So what you were deployed to Iraq, were there any memories, experiences

10:17.720 --> 10:22.160
 that changed you or in general, like you're probably a different

10:22.160 --> 10:23.400
 man on the other side of it?

10:23.680 --> 10:25.360
 How did that time change you?

10:25.760 --> 10:28.360
 I think there, there was two main takeaways that I took, right?

10:28.360 --> 10:32.880
 So one was, um, not a specific moment, but on multiple occasions, uh, I remember

10:32.880 --> 10:36.880
 we were driving down the road and I would look and there would be a 10, 12,

10:36.880 --> 10:37.880
 14 year old kid.

10:38.520 --> 10:42.880
 And if you've never seen somebody who literally has hate and disdain in their

10:42.880 --> 10:47.640
 eyes, just not necessarily to you personally, just to the uniform, to what

10:47.640 --> 10:49.080
 you stand for, it's all this stuff.

10:49.840 --> 10:51.400
 When you see it, you see it right.

10:51.400 --> 10:56.320
 And I always think of, um, if you've ever, uh, watched the movie, uh, 12 strong and

10:56.320 --> 11:00.160
 in it, uh, they've got this Afghan, uh, Afghanistan warlord, and he's talking

11:00.160 --> 11:03.280
 to a bunch of soldiers and he says, you know, you don't have killer eyes.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.160
 You do, you do.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.480
 And he's just like, he can just tell, right?

11:05.480 --> 11:07.000
 He's, he's seen so many soldiers.

11:07.560 --> 11:12.160
 And so I think that that was a, a memory on a number of occasions where I just saw

11:12.160 --> 11:15.160
 young kids and I just said, they hate us.

11:15.560 --> 11:15.920
 Right.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.520
 And, and it's not you personally, it's what you stand for.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.560
 But the really big event was, um, when you first get to these combat zones, a lot of

11:23.560 --> 11:27.920
 times what will happen is, uh, you basically, your unit teams up with a unit

11:27.920 --> 11:30.760
 that's leaving and there's a handoff and happens over a couple of weeks.

11:30.760 --> 11:34.720
 And so you can imagine almost, you know, 1% of our team goes out with 99% of their

11:34.720 --> 11:38.440
 team, then five, 95, 10, 90, all the way till it's 50, 50.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.480
 And then eventually it rotates.

11:39.480 --> 11:42.360
 And then it's majority of our team and a small number of their team.

11:42.960 --> 11:46.920
 And so what a lot of people will explain is the two most dangerous times in war

11:46.960 --> 11:50.200
 are actually the first two or three weeks and the last two or three weeks.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.480
 When you first get there, you don't know who the people are.

11:52.480 --> 11:55.920
 You don't know the terrain, you don't know, you know, kind of the local cultures

11:55.920 --> 11:58.520
 and, and, uh, who to look out for, what signs, all that kind of stuff.

11:58.920 --> 12:01.960
 And the last two or three weeks is you basically think you survived the

12:01.960 --> 12:03.280
 deployment, you're looking forward to going home.

12:03.280 --> 12:04.680
 So you become complacent, things like that.

12:05.480 --> 12:08.680
 And so we made it through that transition period with no issues.

12:08.720 --> 12:12.960
 Uh, but the literally the very first mission, uh, that we went out as a team,

12:12.960 --> 12:16.960
 ourselves, a hundred percent, um, there was two separate incidents.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.720
 Uh, one was we were driving in the middle of the night and, uh, what we think was a

12:20.720 --> 12:25.600
 sniper shot at a truck that I was in, I was standing up outside of it, uh, along

12:25.600 --> 12:26.880
 with a, uh, another guy.

12:27.160 --> 12:31.240
 And that was kind of just a wake up call again of never been shot at before.

12:31.600 --> 12:32.000
 Right.

12:32.200 --> 12:36.880
 And so I'll never forget, uh, you kind of heard this whiz go by and the guy next to

12:36.880 --> 12:38.680
 me was from a rural Pennsylvania.

12:38.680 --> 12:41.240
 And he just said, you know, look, I've never been shot at before either, but

12:41.240 --> 12:42.840
 I've done a lot of hunting, get the fuck down.

12:44.560 --> 12:44.960
 Okay.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.840
 And so, uh, we kept driving that night.

12:48.040 --> 12:53.720
 Um, and, uh, later on in the night, uh, an IED went off, a guy ran over an IED,

12:53.720 --> 12:55.440
 uh, who was at the front of the convoy.

12:55.720 --> 13:00.560
 And when that IED went off, uh, again, I had never been in a convoy that had been

13:00.560 --> 13:02.480
 blown up before, but the training kicks in.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.960
 And so immediately every single person starts screaming out IED, IED, and they

13:05.960 --> 13:07.480
 started looking and trying to figure it out.

13:07.480 --> 13:12.320
 And you realize the United States military did a fantastic job training us before we

13:12.320 --> 13:15.120
 went, because in that moment, nobody thought about anything.

13:15.440 --> 13:17.400
 You just did what you had been programmed to do.

13:17.760 --> 13:21.920
 Um, and so ultimately kind of through the end of that event, uh, there was a US

13:21.920 --> 13:22.840
 soldier that ended up dying.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.160
 He was, uh, shot in the head.

13:24.400 --> 13:29.200
 And, um, when we got back to the base, uh, kind of after that entire event,

13:29.680 --> 13:30.800
 I think it just hit us.

13:31.280 --> 13:32.360
 We are at war.

13:32.520 --> 13:37.320
 And if we make mistakes here, that is the cost of, you know, kind of those mistakes.

13:37.680 --> 13:39.960
 And this was somebody who I didn't know.

13:40.120 --> 13:43.120
 Uh, it was somebody who literally showed up, uh, kind of as secondary

13:43.120 --> 13:48.120
 support, uh, for our unit and basically, uh, was there to help us.

13:48.320 --> 13:48.760
 Right.

13:48.760 --> 13:53.200
 And so it was one of those weird situations where, uh, you have this emotional connection

13:53.200 --> 13:57.680
 because it's somebody who, uh, shared an event with you, but you didn't know them.

13:57.880 --> 13:58.120
 Right.

13:58.120 --> 14:01.200
 And you learn their name later and you understand that they have a family and

14:01.200 --> 14:02.680
 they have young kids and all this stuff.

14:03.040 --> 14:06.000
 And so again, as a 20 year old kid, you're kind of processing all this and

14:06.000 --> 14:10.320
 you just realize like the gun I have in my arm, my hands, it's real for a reason.

14:10.640 --> 14:11.080
 Right.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.720
 And we better take this seriously.

14:13.720 --> 14:17.320
 This is not, you know, let's joking around in kind of the barracks and, you

14:17.320 --> 14:20.000
 know, all the things that you would expect, you know, guys you're doing in the army.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.600
 So I think that was like the moment where I said, Hey, I'm going to learn a lot here.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.080
 Uh, and I got to make sure I get home.

14:26.440 --> 14:30.040
 And you snap it into the training, but nevertheless, I mean, you're somebody

14:30.040 --> 14:32.320
 who thinks philosophically about this world now, right?

14:32.320 --> 14:36.560
 You're, uh, very intelligent and things deeply about the world.

14:37.120 --> 14:42.960
 So looking back, you mentioned hatred in the 14 year old kids eyes, there's death.

14:42.960 --> 14:47.280
 So the way you kind of described this whole story is like training kicks in.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.400
 This, this shit is serious.

14:50.080 --> 14:54.120
 Like this is, uh, you know, there's a reason there's a gun in, in your hand.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.440
 So there's a strategic element.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.120
 There's like, you have to get the job done.

14:58.120 --> 15:03.800
 There's a task at hand, but at the same time, if you zoom out, there's a kid who

15:03.800 --> 15:09.080
 has hate for you, uh, some of those kids would probably, if they could, would kill

15:09.080 --> 15:12.120
 you for the thing you stand for in the uniform.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.320
 And then there's bullets flying at you.

15:15.800 --> 15:22.240
 And then there's people that some of them you might already care for deeply are dying.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.760
 What the hell do you make of that?

15:26.120 --> 15:27.240
 Do you think about that?

15:27.240 --> 15:28.600
 Does any of that haunt you?

15:29.640 --> 15:32.520
 How do you think about the world having witnessed that?

15:32.760 --> 15:33.260
 Yeah.

15:33.680 --> 15:36.160
 A lot of times when we would talk about it, we were there.

15:36.760 --> 15:40.120
 If I was that kid, I would want to kill that person too.

15:40.240 --> 15:40.740
 Right.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.300
 I would have hatred as well.

15:42.340 --> 15:42.840
 Right.

15:42.840 --> 15:46.940
 Imagine if in the United States tomorrow, you and I woke up and there was tanks

15:46.940 --> 15:51.180
 rolling down the street from another country and they were basically imposing

15:51.180 --> 15:55.500
 their rules on us, whether they thought it was the right thing to do or not, the

15:55.500 --> 15:59.220
 soldiers were there and they were doing this, we would probably feel not so great

15:59.220 --> 16:00.020
 about it, right.

16:00.020 --> 16:03.260
 At kind of a minimum and at a maximum, we'd be really, really pissed off.

16:03.260 --> 16:03.900
 We would fight back.

16:04.540 --> 16:08.220
 And so what you don't understand when you're in the heat of the moment is why

16:08.220 --> 16:09.260
 does this person feel this way?

16:09.260 --> 16:15.500
 And so what's very weird is, well, what happens if a year ago, US soldiers came

16:15.500 --> 16:19.820
 through, they got shot at, they returned fire and they killed that kid's uncle.

16:20.820 --> 16:21.740
 You'd be pissed off.

16:21.900 --> 16:22.400
 Right.

16:22.700 --> 16:26.540
 And so you just start to understand, like we look at war very black and white.

16:26.620 --> 16:29.300
 We look at it very much from a clinical perspective.

16:29.500 --> 16:32.180
 We're going to go, we're going to go kind of invade somewhere.

16:32.660 --> 16:34.900
 We are the most dominant military in the world.

16:34.900 --> 16:36.180
 We're very good at invading.

16:36.180 --> 16:40.540
 And we will crush wherever we invade, but when you're actually on the ground, what

16:40.540 --> 16:42.180
 you understand is the humanity of it all.

16:42.420 --> 16:42.920
 Right.

16:42.940 --> 16:47.340
 And so what becomes very interesting is pretty much every veteran I know that

16:47.340 --> 16:50.380
 comes back, they're some of the largest pacifists in the world.

16:50.500 --> 16:55.500
 And I always revert back to Marcus Luttrell, who was a famous Navy SEAL, and

16:55.500 --> 16:57.220
 there's a movie made about him and his story.

16:57.700 --> 17:01.980
 He gave a speech one time that I saw and he basically said, listen, if you're a

17:01.980 --> 17:06.340
 politician, your job is to be the diplomat, do everything you possibly can, not to

17:06.340 --> 17:10.220
 send me and my friends anywhere, because when you send us, we're going to bring

17:10.220 --> 17:11.940
 hell with us, right.

17:12.340 --> 17:16.500
 And understand that is the business that we are in, but every single other person

17:16.500 --> 17:19.820
 up until we get sent has a job to do to prevent having to send us.

17:20.220 --> 17:23.620
 And I think that ultimately that's where you see a lot of kind of this generation

17:23.620 --> 17:28.180
 that has fought in Iraq and Afghanistan that says, listen, maybe we shouldn't be

17:28.180 --> 17:32.100
 running around the world being the police, maybe we shouldn't be going and invading

17:32.100 --> 17:35.980
 all these different countries, because when you actually get to see firsthand

17:35.980 --> 17:39.660
 what happens, it's just something that we should avoid at all costs.

17:39.820 --> 17:44.820
 But if we have to go, or we have to actually send soldiers somewhere, understand

17:44.820 --> 17:46.220
 what happens when that occurs.

17:46.620 --> 17:48.820
 And you know, the United States is the best in the world at doing it.

17:49.780 --> 17:53.180
 Do you think, I'm thinking about that kid with the hatred.

17:53.180 --> 17:55.700
 Do you think there will always be hatred in the world?

17:55.740 --> 17:57.220
 Do you think there will always be hatred?

17:57.220 --> 18:01.340
 In the world, do you think, uh, from another perspective, do you think there'll

18:01.340 --> 18:06.420
 be war always, is that a fundamental aspect of human nature or is that

18:06.420 --> 18:07.740
 something we can escape?

18:08.380 --> 18:08.700
 Yeah.

18:08.700 --> 18:12.580
 So war, I think has like very negative connotations in terms of bullets and

18:12.580 --> 18:18.660
 bombs and death and kind of just very morbid type, um, um, understanding.

18:19.540 --> 18:22.620
 Conflict on the other hand, I think people look at and say, of course

18:22.620 --> 18:23.820
 there will always be conflict, right.

18:23.820 --> 18:27.900
 You just can't have billions of people all on the same planet without some

18:27.900 --> 18:31.220
 level of disagreement, whether that's a disagreement of ideas, disagreement

18:31.220 --> 18:34.460
 over physical, you know, geography, uh, or something else.

18:34.460 --> 18:36.620
 And so I think conflict will always exist.

18:37.100 --> 18:40.220
 The question is what form does war take moving forward?

18:40.540 --> 18:44.620
 And so in my mind, you know, it's starting to look a lot more clinical,

18:44.700 --> 18:45.020
 right?

18:45.220 --> 18:49.380
 A lot more drones, a lot less soldiers on the ground, a lot more use of special

18:49.380 --> 18:52.900
 forces and kind of these small, highly specialized teams rather than kind of big

18:52.900 --> 18:53.820
 mechanical armies.

18:54.140 --> 18:57.700
 Um, and then you get into like the information warfare and kind of cyber

18:57.700 --> 19:01.460
 warfare and you start to understand that we're at war with a lot of people right

19:01.460 --> 19:02.340
 now, right?

19:02.420 --> 19:05.220
 Doesn't mean we're necessarily dropping bombs, uh, on their countries.

19:05.500 --> 19:09.300
 Doesn't necessarily mean we're sending soldiers there, but on a daily basis, we

19:09.300 --> 19:12.260
 are engaged in these kind of, you know, cyber battlefields.

19:12.260 --> 19:17.300
 And so if that's where war starts to play out, um, it, one changes the tools

19:17.300 --> 19:21.140
 and tactics and techniques that, uh, we need to arm our country and other

19:21.140 --> 19:22.420
 countries will arm themselves with.

19:22.420 --> 19:25.500
 But it also changes the way that we think about war, right?

19:25.540 --> 19:30.020
 It seems, it sounds a lot less worrisome if I say, Hey, we're going to go to war

19:30.020 --> 19:32.140
 with a country, but by the way, there's going to be no death.

19:33.100 --> 19:33.460
 Right?

19:33.500 --> 19:33.900
 Okay.

19:33.980 --> 19:36.700
 Like that doesn't sound nearly as bad as, Hey, we're going to go send 10,000

19:36.700 --> 19:39.620
 soldiers and you know, some percentage of them are going to die on the battlefield.

19:39.620 --> 19:43.180
 And then we're going to, you know, basically pipe back videos and articles

19:43.340 --> 19:45.020
 saying that American soldiers are dying.

19:45.140 --> 19:45.420
 Yeah.

19:45.780 --> 19:49.740
 It does seem to be a fundamental difference between the, the Genghis Khan

19:49.740 --> 19:58.300
 style, like if I would feel differently if somebody like hand to hand with a knife

19:58.340 --> 20:04.620
 murdered my family versus cyber security, why I stole all their data, stole all

20:04.620 --> 20:08.980
 their money, stole everything they own, falsified their identity, all that kind

20:08.980 --> 20:15.180
 of stuff that those are both traumatic events, but they do seem to be

20:15.180 --> 20:19.740
 fundamentally different, but maybe that's actually very narrow style thinking,

20:20.260 --> 20:24.860
 because ultimately you have to think about what is life and what's happiness.

20:25.540 --> 20:31.460
 And, um, it's like the samurai thinking, I'm not sure what's more painful.

20:32.380 --> 20:37.180
 If I take it to myself, like, I'm not sure what I would rather live through

20:37.180 --> 20:46.740
 being stabbed, like to death, or having my identity stolen, all my money stolen,

20:47.220 --> 20:53.660
 or maybe reputation destroyed, like with lies or something like that.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.420
 That that's very interesting to think about.

20:56.420 --> 20:58.860
 If you think about quality of life and all those kinds of things,

20:58.980 --> 21:00.900
 well, one's finite, right?

21:01.580 --> 21:05.780
 One's the pain ends and the other is kind of a long prolonged, almost torture.

21:05.780 --> 21:08.260
 So it's physical pain versus psychological pain.

21:08.380 --> 21:11.660
 It's really interesting to, it's really interesting to think about.

21:12.180 --> 21:15.660
 And I think another key piece to this, which I don't have answers to, but,

21:15.660 --> 21:19.740
 but there is an element of emotion and rage in the physical violence versus

21:20.060 --> 21:22.940
 again, more of that clinical, you know, information warfare.

21:22.980 --> 21:29.780
 And so, um, it's really easy to show a battlefield where there's death on both

21:29.780 --> 21:34.340
 sides and bombs being dropped and buildings destroyed, um, it fits very

21:34.340 --> 21:38.780
 well into propaganda for everyone involved, right, regardless of what side

21:38.780 --> 21:42.780
 they're on, when you start talking about cyber warfare, how many times have

21:42.780 --> 21:47.380
 we seen a big company get data hacked or information hacked and we all, you

21:47.380 --> 21:50.620
 know, read the headlines, maybe throw a tweet out and then move on with our day

21:50.620 --> 21:51.700
 and don't remember it anymore.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.100
 And so it's just very, very different.

21:54.100 --> 21:57.860
 I think, uh, in, in the, uh, motion and response that it invokes and people

21:57.860 --> 21:58.900
 when they hear about it as well.

21:59.820 --> 22:02.980
 Given the conflict, do you think people are fundamentally good?

22:02.980 --> 22:08.020
 Are we all sort of like blank slates that could be evil given the environment

22:08.300 --> 22:13.540
 or good given the environment, or can we kind of, is there some base that we can

22:13.540 --> 22:21.420
 rely on that people, if left to their own devices will be good and trustworthy and

22:21.740 --> 22:25.060
 honest, I think you have to separate out intention from action.

22:25.700 --> 22:30.820
 So if you talk to some of the most heinous criminals in the world, they've

22:30.820 --> 22:36.220
 rationalized their actions, and so you've got to ask yourself, what is the level

22:36.220 --> 22:41.060
 of which they understood what they were doing, that they intended to be malicious,

22:41.060 --> 22:47.620
 nefarious, um, and kind of do bad things versus the actual actions themselves.

22:47.620 --> 22:52.980
 And so, um, even as a society, you know, if let's say, for example, you were to

22:52.980 --> 22:55.860
 walk down the street and you were to murder somebody on the sidewalk, completely

22:55.860 --> 23:01.500
 unprovoked, we would look at you and say, you are a, you know, a sociopath, uh, you

23:01.500 --> 23:04.620
 have everything wrong with you and that is somebody that we do not want in our

23:04.620 --> 23:09.780
 society, and therefore we will levy, you know, the extent of rule of law against

23:09.780 --> 23:12.300
 you in order to protect society from you, right?

23:12.300 --> 23:16.620
 And you become that monster, that beast, if in the same situation, somebody walks

23:16.620 --> 23:22.660
 in your house with a knife and you murder them or you kill them, now we put you up

23:22.660 --> 23:26.740
 on a pedestal as a hero, and those are two very, very different responses.

23:26.780 --> 23:31.420
 They may be just as morbid, they may be just as violent, uh, in terms of the

23:31.420 --> 23:35.380
 actual actions, the intentions, the way it's perceived is very, very different.

23:35.420 --> 23:40.420
 And so I think that, uh, as a world, we like a very black and white, clean cut,

23:40.460 --> 23:43.500
 you know, good, bad, uh, I think the world's a lot more messy than that.

23:43.540 --> 23:48.340
 And I think that, uh, a lot of times when you look at intention, it's hard for us

23:48.340 --> 23:53.140
 to tell what somebody's intention is, but I've looked at a lot of, you know, people

23:53.140 --> 23:56.020
 who are both considered very good and also a lot of people are considered very

23:56.020 --> 24:00.820
 bad and they sound very similar in terms of the motivations for their actions.

24:01.340 --> 24:04.460
 And so I think that it's just a really hard problem that probably doesn't

24:04.460 --> 24:06.180
 have a perfect solution or an answer.

24:06.500 --> 24:10.860
 Do you give much value to the intention or do you think it's better to look at

24:10.860 --> 24:17.100
 the results of the behavior, uh, as opposed to the, the underlying ideology?

24:17.100 --> 24:21.580
 Underlying ideology, the underlying intention of, of the behavior.

24:22.220 --> 24:25.300
 I think that intention gets at the question of like, are people inherently

24:25.300 --> 24:26.580
 good or bad, right?

24:26.780 --> 24:30.700
 Is I think that they're generally inherently good and the intention is

24:30.700 --> 24:35.020
 driving towards the thing that they believe is the best outcome or the best

24:35.260 --> 24:37.500
 thing for them to pursue the action.

24:37.500 --> 24:39.900
 I think is where we spend most of our time focused on.

24:40.180 --> 24:45.820
 Um, and frankly, we actually may be a better society or, uh, kind of kinder

24:45.820 --> 24:48.500
 as a humanity to each other if we spent more time looking at

24:48.500 --> 24:49.820
 intention rather than action.

24:50.180 --> 24:53.300
 Um, but again, you know, if somebody walks down the street and murders

24:53.300 --> 24:57.700
 somebody, uh, it's really hard to have a conversation and it may be inappropriate

24:57.780 --> 25:02.140
 for us to have a conversation about intention versus, uh, any level of,

25:02.140 --> 25:03.260
 of action, right?

25:04.940 --> 25:10.900
 So you're one of the prominent, I would say even the faces of the, the world

25:10.900 --> 25:16.380
 of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, that whole entire world was dive straight in and

25:16.380 --> 25:22.260
 ask, uh, do you think, do you consider yourself a Bitcoin maximalist?

25:23.140 --> 25:28.020
 I think that the way I really look at it is, uh, I work backwards off of what

25:28.020 --> 25:33.340
 is the maximalism that I believe in and the world that I believe in is, uh, kind

25:33.340 --> 25:39.420
 of an automated world that is run on these open decentralized protocols.

25:39.420 --> 25:45.660
 Uh, and what we ultimately do is we return sovereignty and individualism

25:45.660 --> 25:49.420
 and, and kind of, uh, personal responsibility and liberty, uh,

25:49.420 --> 25:50.940
 to people over institutions.

25:51.380 --> 25:56.300
 And what we end up doing is we end up, uh, kind of taking what has historically

25:56.300 --> 26:01.340
 been a very analog or physical world economy and, uh, geographic rule.

26:01.860 --> 26:05.980
 And we then kind of put it in the cloud and this digital economy becomes the

26:05.980 --> 26:11.180
 prevalent way that we all, uh, conduct commerce, communicate, uh, et cetera.

26:11.180 --> 26:15.220
 And so it's less about any one single technology to me, right?

26:15.220 --> 26:20.740
 I think that it's pretty stupid for people to, um, almost in a way, uh, put

26:20.780 --> 26:26.540
 an inanimate object up for, uh, you know, some sort of obsession, uh, to me,

26:26.540 --> 26:31.500
 it's much more about the ideals, the ethos, uh, and the most rational, uh,

26:31.540 --> 26:35.420
 and likely path to that kind of end result or that world that I think, you

26:35.420 --> 26:37.220
 know, is at this point, just a foregone conclusion.

26:37.260 --> 26:41.340
 So the distinction there, and maybe people don't know the terminology,

26:41.340 --> 26:47.780
 maximalism is basically saying, I really think this is a good idea.

26:49.100 --> 26:52.820
 Like, uh, you know, if you prefer a certain kind of diet, it could be a

26:52.820 --> 26:57.340
 keto maximalist saying like, this is probably, maybe it's not a hundred

26:57.340 --> 27:01.300
 percent, but probably the diet that's healthiest for humans kind of thing.

27:01.300 --> 27:06.620
 In the same sense, Bitcoin maximalism is saying, you know, of course we

27:06.620 --> 27:10.060
 don't know, there's a lot of uncertainty, but this particular technology seems

27:10.060 --> 27:14.740
 to be the best representations of some set of ideals that defines progress

27:14.740 --> 27:20.060
 in the future, but you're drawing a distinction between sort of, um, cult

27:20.060 --> 27:26.260
 like obsession about an object of any kind, whether it's keto, uh, or, uh,

27:26.260 --> 27:32.140
 Bitcoin, and just sort of believing that a technology is the best representation

27:32.180 --> 27:33.980
 of a particular set of ideals.

27:34.300 --> 27:41.620
 And you believe that sort of, uh, this moving into the cloud, uh, both

27:41.620 --> 27:45.700
 the distributed nature of it, but also just the digital nature of it is

27:45.700 --> 27:49.260
 something that's going to, uh, be a positive step for humanity.

27:49.500 --> 27:49.700
 Yeah.

27:49.700 --> 27:53.180
 I would even take maximalism a step further, and it's not just the kind

27:53.180 --> 27:58.300
 of singular viewpoint of this is the best, it's also, uh, an element

27:58.300 --> 27:59.980
 of it's anti everything else.

28:00.620 --> 28:00.980
 Right.

28:01.100 --> 28:05.500
 So, you know, take keto, for example, uh, the keto diet is not only the best diet.

28:05.540 --> 28:06.780
 All the other diets are bad.

28:06.940 --> 28:07.140
 Yeah.

28:07.220 --> 28:07.700
 Right.

28:07.820 --> 28:10.100
 And so it's, it's a very binary view of the world.

28:10.340 --> 28:14.180
 Um, I think that what's probably most misunderstood about, uh, let's take

28:14.180 --> 28:18.780
 Bitcoin, uh, as a specific example, is that most of the people who are labeled

28:18.780 --> 28:23.220
 Bitcoin maximalist, they would be open minded if they believe that something

28:23.220 --> 28:28.020
 else came along that was a superior technology or had a, a better, um, kind

28:28.020 --> 28:32.580
 of probability of achieving again, that ultimate vision, I think where, uh,

28:32.660 --> 28:37.740
 there's this controversy and kind of clashing of, uh, ideas is that the

28:37.740 --> 28:41.980
 Bitcoin community believes Bitcoin is the best way to do that and has very

28:41.980 --> 28:45.900
 specific arguments as to why the other things are not right.

28:45.900 --> 28:49.740
 And so what ultimately ends up happening, which is very weird in the investing

28:49.740 --> 28:52.340
 world, right, it's unlikely that you and I are going to sit down and you're

28:52.340 --> 28:54.660
 going to like Apple stock is the best stock and there's no other stock.

28:54.660 --> 28:55.420
 That's worth anything.

28:55.460 --> 28:55.660
 Yeah.

28:55.700 --> 28:56.060
 Right.

28:56.380 --> 29:00.540
 And, uh, and then also it's very weird if you said to me, um, you know, this

29:00.540 --> 29:05.020
 stock is worth zero and that's where everything that I own, I've put on a

29:05.020 --> 29:06.740
 short on one single company, right?

29:06.740 --> 29:07.820
 There's diversification.

29:07.820 --> 29:10.780
 There's a much more kind of probabilistic thinking in finance in general.

29:10.780 --> 29:15.380
 Uh, when it comes to this specific world of cryptocurrency and kind of digital

29:15.380 --> 29:20.740
 assets, if you will, uh, is there's two main groups of people who are trying to

29:20.740 --> 29:25.660
 build two very, very different things at the onset, but when you unpack it and you

29:25.660 --> 29:28.100
 start to spend more and more time on it, you rise, they're actually trying to

29:28.100 --> 29:29.940
 accomplish the same thing in two different ways.

29:30.340 --> 29:33.580
 So Bitcoin is seen, I think, as a, uh, a digital currency, right?

29:33.580 --> 29:36.460
 Kind of the idea that this is going to ascend to become the next global

29:36.460 --> 29:40.220
 reserve currency, it's a programmatic kind of digital currency, but it's

29:40.220 --> 29:43.460
 also a programmatic kind of transparent, um, money.

29:43.700 --> 29:47.820
 And, uh, it's essentially just 180 degrees difference than the inflationary,

29:48.060 --> 29:51.500
 you know, non transparent, uh, fiat currencies that exist in the world.

29:52.460 --> 29:54.460
 You then look at kind of everything else, right?

29:54.460 --> 29:57.820
 And you have a lot of smart contract platforms and various things that

29:57.820 --> 30:00.660
 they're all going after at Ethereum with kind of the world computer

30:00.660 --> 30:02.860
 approach, and you can kind of go down the line with all their other

30:02.860 --> 30:04.300
 arguments as to what they're trying to build.

30:04.300 --> 30:09.860
 I think the big difference just comes down to, uh, innovation versus security.

30:09.860 --> 30:15.860
 And when you simplistically look at it via that lens, you actually understand

30:15.860 --> 30:16.780
 where both people are coming from.

30:16.900 --> 30:19.500
 When you say security, sorry to interrupt, do you mean financial

30:19.500 --> 30:22.740
 security or do you mean like literally the, the, the security of the,

30:23.340 --> 30:25.620
 of the particular cryptocurrency?

30:25.900 --> 30:28.100
 The, the technical security of a blockchain.

30:28.100 --> 30:31.220
 So when you look at, let's say, um, Bitcoin versus Ethereum, right?

30:31.220 --> 30:34.980
 Bitcoin has decided in that community has decided security is the number

30:34.980 --> 30:36.340
 one thing that you have to optimize for.

30:36.380 --> 30:41.220
 So decentralization, um, over everything else in terms of transaction

30:41.220 --> 30:45.980
 speeds, uh, cost, anything that you could come up with, that is, uh, something

30:45.980 --> 30:47.500
 that would be important for a currency.

30:47.860 --> 30:49.700
 The number one thing to optimize for is security.

30:50.020 --> 30:53.140
 And as we have seen, uh, with a lot of technologies, right?

30:53.220 --> 30:56.260
 Facebook's, uh, Libra or now what's known as DiEM is a great example.

30:56.260 --> 31:01.180
 Uh, not having decentralization is susceptible to the nation state.

31:01.900 --> 31:07.380
 And so a lot of these other platforms and blockchains, uh, they say security

31:07.380 --> 31:10.620
 is important, but it's not the most important thing we believe there's a

31:10.620 --> 31:15.100
 trade off between, you know, a little less security and transaction speed or

31:15.140 --> 31:17.020
 composability or whatever it is.

31:17.460 --> 31:22.020
 And so take a theorem as kind of the second, uh, largest, uh, community

31:22.020 --> 31:23.220
 and blockchain by market cap.

31:23.220 --> 31:25.780
 It was created because somebody wanted to, or a group of people

31:25.780 --> 31:26.980
 wanted to do something on Bitcoin.

31:26.980 --> 31:27.980
 They felt like they couldn't do it.

31:27.980 --> 31:30.220
 And so they said, Hey, we're going to go create something that has the smart

31:30.220 --> 31:31.820
 contracts that we can then go do here.

31:32.540 --> 31:33.860
 Again, this is technology, right?

31:33.860 --> 31:37.420
 And so the tribalism of like, you're right, you're wrong to me is a little

31:37.420 --> 31:40.620
 childish, just in the sense of like the market is going to decide what is most

31:40.620 --> 31:41.140
 valuable.

31:41.580 --> 31:44.420
 And then when you go inside of that community, like there's a lot of dumb

31:44.420 --> 31:47.260
 ideas, people are trying to build around Bitcoin, but there's also a lot of really,

31:47.260 --> 31:50.500
 really great ideas that people are trying to build around Bitcoin, same thing in

31:50.500 --> 31:54.220
 the Ethereum world. And so what you end up getting, I think, is the tribalism

31:54.220 --> 31:57.540
 really comes out of the idea that there's a ticker price that is attached

31:57.540 --> 31:58.780
 to all of this, right?

31:59.020 --> 32:04.540
 If you go back in history of technology, venture capitalists didn't sit around

32:04.620 --> 32:08.300
 the table and yell and scream at each other in this like religious zealot way,

32:08.500 --> 32:11.820
 right? Because you bet on one type of cloud computing platform.

32:11.820 --> 32:13.460
 And I bet on another one, right?

32:13.580 --> 32:15.820
 It's just the market's going to decide, we're both going to work on and try to

32:15.820 --> 32:18.460
 make our successful, uh, here in the world.

32:18.460 --> 32:21.660
 I think that the sensitivity and mainly it comes out of the Bitcoin community is

32:21.660 --> 32:26.060
 that a lot of this is being funded, not only by venture capitalists and kind of

32:26.060 --> 32:28.820
 professional money managers and asset allocators.

32:29.300 --> 32:32.980
 There's also this element of including the retail investor and the public.

32:33.540 --> 32:37.700
 And so it, whether it's through ICOs or some other forms of capital raising,

32:38.020 --> 32:42.380
 um, there's arguments for it saying, Hey, look, uh, this now gives kind of the

32:42.380 --> 32:45.540
 little guy, some sort of access and an ability to do it.

32:45.540 --> 32:48.420
 But there's also arguments against it. Some people say, Hey, it's easier to dupe

32:48.420 --> 32:50.860
 them and it's easier to run scams and kind of all this stuff.

32:50.860 --> 32:55.900
 And so ultimately I think that, uh, crypto is this like arena of ideas.

32:55.900 --> 33:00.660
 It is literally the war of attrition and, uh, what will end up happening is 10

33:00.660 --> 33:04.140
 years from now, you and I will talk and we're going to say, well, the market said

33:04.180 --> 33:05.740
 X was valuable and Y wasn't.

33:06.300 --> 33:11.180
 And so all of the tribalism from between, you know, here and there, uh, it's fun.

33:11.220 --> 33:12.340
 It's, you know, engaging.

33:12.340 --> 33:15.580
 Whatever, but ultimately it doesn't really matter because the public is involved.

33:15.580 --> 33:16.780
 There's a lot of personalities.

33:16.780 --> 33:22.180
 And so a lot of times we focus on the extreme personalities that do a lot of

33:22.220 --> 33:24.860
 maybe, uh, pardon the French shit talking.

33:24.860 --> 33:28.980
 And, and so we kind of focus on that, but that's not necessarily a representative

33:28.980 --> 33:30.340
 of the communities involved.

33:30.540 --> 33:33.980
 Let's talk about Bitcoin first, and then it'll help us use as a kind of comparison

33:33.980 --> 33:35.980
 to Ethereum or whatever else.

33:36.260 --> 33:38.460
 So when you think about what is money, right?

33:38.460 --> 33:39.500
 That's kind of the first question.

33:39.500 --> 33:43.100
 People really kind of go down the rabbit hole on, and ultimately today,

33:43.140 --> 33:44.620
 it's a belief system, right?

33:44.660 --> 33:47.980
 And you may believe that one currency has more value over another because

33:47.980 --> 33:52.580
 it's backed by a certain military or a certain government has a monetary policy

33:52.580 --> 33:54.220
 that you believe in or don't believe in.

33:54.580 --> 33:58.060
 Um, but ultimately it's a belief system that there's nothing backing this, uh,

33:58.100 --> 34:01.180
 other than, uh, a government asks you to pay your taxes in it, right?

34:01.220 --> 34:04.580
 And they can have a monopoly on violence, uh, in terms of they can put you in jail.

34:04.580 --> 34:07.740
 If you don't pay your taxes, uh, they can, uh, they can, uh, they can

34:07.740 --> 34:09.860
 go to other countries and they can invade and do all this stuff.

34:11.900 --> 34:13.580
 It wasn't always like that, right?

34:13.620 --> 34:17.260
 It was historically a layer one technology was gold.

34:17.540 --> 34:20.660
 And so gold was a fantastic store of value.

34:20.700 --> 34:23.380
 You knew that if you held gold, it wasn't going to be inflated away.

34:23.380 --> 34:26.660
 It was sound money was outside the system and no one could create more of it.

34:27.180 --> 34:30.700
 And the reason why that's important is because that optimization for store

34:30.700 --> 34:35.860
 of value served as the bedrock of the entire stack of, uh, money.

34:35.860 --> 34:40.300
 Uh, for 5,000 years. And so the problem with that though, again, trade off between

34:40.300 --> 34:43.100
 store of value is it was really hard to transact with, right?

34:43.100 --> 34:46.700
 If I came in here and I, and you said, Hey, I want a couple of ounces of gold and I

34:46.700 --> 34:49.660
 had a whole bar, I'd have to literally shave off the ounces of gold.

34:49.900 --> 34:51.700
 Uh, it's heavy to carry around.

34:51.700 --> 34:55.940
 If you said to me, Hey, you're in one city, mail it to me, really expensive.

34:55.940 --> 34:56.940
 You know, there's all these issues with it.

34:57.460 --> 35:01.460
 And so ultimately what people said was, well, let's create a second layer on top

35:01.460 --> 35:03.900
 of that gold in order to make it easier to transact with it.

35:03.900 --> 35:06.100
 That gold in order to make it easier to transact.

35:06.420 --> 35:08.340
 And so we created paper claims on the gold.

35:08.380 --> 35:10.220
 So, Hey, don't carry around the gold in your pocket anymore.

35:10.460 --> 35:11.780
 Put it in a vault or a bank.

35:11.940 --> 35:13.700
 They're going to issue a paper claim.

35:13.900 --> 35:16.020
 Now you and I can trade these paper claims around.

35:16.220 --> 35:18.660
 And at any point, if you want the gold, you just show up and you say, Hey, give

35:18.660 --> 35:20.900
 me three ounces of gold or two bars or whatever.

35:21.540 --> 35:24.260
 And so that actually made the store of value.

35:24.340 --> 35:27.420
 It was allowed that to be the anchor and kind of the most important part, the

35:27.420 --> 35:31.060
 security of your, of your purchasing power, but now it became easier to transact.

35:31.100 --> 35:32.940
 And then eventually we built layers even on top of that.

35:32.940 --> 35:36.420
 So everything from electronic money, uh, kind of electronic UCIPS, all the way

35:36.420 --> 35:40.540
 to credit and other systems on top of that gold 1971 comes around and obviously

35:40.540 --> 35:42.980
 we D peg from that gold, right?

35:42.980 --> 35:44.420
 And it was a temporary measure at the time.

35:44.420 --> 35:45.660
 We ended up not going back to it.

35:45.980 --> 35:49.380
 And so what you moved or transitioned from was sound money, which was outside

35:49.380 --> 35:52.740
 the system, no one could create more to now the government had full control.

35:52.740 --> 35:54.300
 They could create as much as they wanted to.

35:54.660 --> 35:57.460
 They tried to be responsible and disciplined, but obviously hard to do.

35:57.460 --> 35:58.660
 Sometimes we've been really good at it.

35:58.660 --> 35:59.940
 Sometimes we've been less good at it.

35:59.940 --> 36:02.540
 And then you go around the world and some countries have absolutely sucked

36:02.540 --> 36:03.540
 at it and some have been good at it.

36:04.260 --> 36:07.860
 And so when you look into the Bitcoin world, I think that when you look at

36:07.860 --> 36:12.460
 this optimization for security, similar to gold store value, people hold it.

36:12.620 --> 36:15.020
 Purchasing power has gone up a lot year over year.

36:15.020 --> 36:19.500
 It's like a 200% year over year compound annual growth for over a decade.

36:19.620 --> 36:19.820
 Right?

36:19.820 --> 36:22.860
 And so you measure this in kind of the us dollar exchange price, et cetera.

36:23.420 --> 36:26.860
 But there's still a lot of people who will yell and scream about it's slow.

36:27.180 --> 36:28.180
 It's costly, right?

36:28.180 --> 36:32.300
 All the things around those transactions that are obstacles or challenges.

36:32.740 --> 36:35.380
 And so there's basically two schools of thought, and this is where we

36:35.380 --> 36:36.940
 kind of get into the bifurcation.

36:37.260 --> 36:40.380
 Some people just said, Hey, this technology is antiquated.

36:40.380 --> 36:41.180
 We can't use it.

36:41.180 --> 36:42.100
 It doesn't make sense.

36:42.340 --> 36:44.900
 Uh, and so what we're going to do is we're going to go build something new.

36:45.180 --> 36:47.820
 And so you go get, you know, kind of all of the various versions there.

36:48.700 --> 36:52.580
 The Bitcoin community says, no, just like gold had paper claims and other

36:52.580 --> 36:55.820
 things built on top and layer two, three, four, five, we're going to do that here.

36:55.820 --> 36:58.380
 And so they've already started to build kind of this layer two where

36:58.540 --> 36:59.740
 it's easier to transact.

36:59.740 --> 37:01.580
 It's cheaper, it's faster, et cetera.

37:02.180 --> 37:05.980
 And so I actually think that both of those worlds are going

37:05.980 --> 37:07.260
 to coexist in the future.

37:07.580 --> 37:11.020
 The big question is just which one has more importance, right?

37:11.020 --> 37:13.020
 So again, get out of binary.

37:13.060 --> 37:14.340
 It's just probabilistically.

37:14.860 --> 37:19.700
 And so my personal belief is that the security that the store of value

37:19.700 --> 37:23.820
 component as the bedrock for a monetary system is essential, right?

37:23.820 --> 37:28.340
 Like that is the most important thing because you can always improve

37:28.340 --> 37:31.860
 the other components, but you can't go back and fix that kind of core piece.

37:32.660 --> 37:37.460
 So money, money's a, an idea that we all it's like an emergent

37:37.460 --> 37:38.580
 idea that we believe in.

37:39.060 --> 37:44.260
 You're saying that security is one of the most fundamental catalysts or fuels

37:44.540 --> 37:50.660
 for that idea to sort of take hold and be stable and sort of take over the world.

37:50.660 --> 37:54.420
 The other stuff is really nice to have, but if you don't have the security,

37:54.420 --> 37:57.820
 you're not going to, like, it's not going to spread in the viral

37:57.820 --> 38:00.380
 sense in, in our human brains.

38:00.860 --> 38:04.660
 Well, and especially in light of the kind of the macro economy, right?

38:04.660 --> 38:09.180
 So like, what's so fascinating about the last 12 months is, um, in

38:09.180 --> 38:12.140
 investing in general, the best returns, right?

38:12.140 --> 38:15.340
 I kind of put that in air quotes a little bit is something that is different

38:15.660 --> 38:17.460
 than everything else and right.

38:17.460 --> 38:20.300
 So being different and wrong just means you're an idiot, right?

38:20.420 --> 38:23.580
 Being different and right means that that's where kind of the outsize returns

38:23.580 --> 38:27.660
 are. And so if you look around the world at currencies today, they're all the same.

38:27.900 --> 38:32.340
 They're all inflationary, unlimited supply controlled by a government done and

38:32.340 --> 38:34.900
 decisions made in a very non transparent process.

38:35.620 --> 38:38.380
 And what we've watched is the manipulation of all of those currencies

38:38.380 --> 38:43.300
 over the last 12 months in direct contrast to that is this thing, Bitcoin,

38:43.300 --> 38:47.900
 which is outside of the system, has a finite supply, transparent and programmatic

38:47.900 --> 38:53.140
 monetary policy. And so when you see those two systems kind of, um, in comparison

38:53.140 --> 38:56.740
 to each other in the United States, there's a lot of people who say the dollar

38:56.740 --> 39:00.260
 works great for me. I can go to the ATM, I can get out physical cash.

39:00.300 --> 39:02.140
 If I want to swipe a card, I could do that.

39:02.700 --> 39:06.340
 My money in my bank doesn't lose 50% of its value in a day in terms of

39:06.340 --> 39:08.620
 purchasing power. Like the dollar's pretty good.

39:09.340 --> 39:11.980
 When you go to other countries, that might not be the case.

39:11.980 --> 39:16.300
 And so I do think that there's a kind of a relative analysis that goes on here.

39:16.340 --> 39:19.740
 If you compare Bitcoin to the dollar, there's all kinds of arguments to make

39:19.740 --> 39:22.260
 that the dollar is better as a medium of exchange today.

39:22.900 --> 39:26.780
 But if I go and I tell you, well, what about in these kind of extreme examples

39:26.780 --> 39:29.860
 of Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Turkey, et cetera.

39:30.540 --> 39:34.420
 And so I think that that's kind of one perspective to view this through is

39:34.460 --> 39:38.140
 security versus all of the innovative components of a medium of exchange, et

39:38.140 --> 39:41.700
 cetera. The second thing, though, that I think is really important is

39:41.700 --> 39:42.700
 around censorship.

39:43.620 --> 39:47.340
 And so when you look at, again, every currency in the world today, every

39:47.340 --> 39:51.060
 single financial service, they're highly susceptible to censorship.

39:51.380 --> 39:54.780
 And actually, I would argue the United States is in the business of

39:54.780 --> 39:58.940
 censorship in terms of how many countries around the world do we sanction

39:59.180 --> 40:04.860
 and cut them off in either a minimal or a very material way from the global

40:04.860 --> 40:08.140
 financial system. So when you define it, when you talk about censorship,

40:08.140 --> 40:12.460
 do you mean just the censoring your ability to operate freely in the world?

40:13.020 --> 40:16.220
 Well, look at it a little bit differently, which is that the United

40:16.220 --> 40:20.020
 States has kind of the American superiority because we have the bombs,

40:20.020 --> 40:22.660
 the bullets, the soldiers and that military might.

40:23.140 --> 40:26.860
 We basically impose our will around the world.

40:27.260 --> 40:32.300
 And so there's a very strong argument to be made that there are certain

40:32.300 --> 40:35.660
 countries around the world that are being sanctioned, that the people

40:35.660 --> 40:39.980
 of those countries did nothing wrong. Now, the governments are bad, right?

40:39.980 --> 40:43.500
 In terms of the way that you and I would look at democratic rule or

40:43.700 --> 40:48.060
 communism or whatever it is, but the people are being hurt as well.

40:48.100 --> 40:51.020
 So there's a whole group of people who would just argue, listen, we

40:51.020 --> 40:55.300
 shouldn't hurt anyone at the expense of punishing one person or a group

40:55.300 --> 40:58.780
 of people. There's other people argue against that. But I do think that

40:58.940 --> 41:02.700
 if you really kind of zoom out and you say, I'm going to take myself out

41:02.700 --> 41:05.940
 of the Western worldview, and I'm simply going to look at this as we're

41:05.940 --> 41:10.020
 all part of the human race, it's censorship. And there might be an

41:10.140 --> 41:13.060
 argument for censorship, but there also might be an argument against

41:13.060 --> 41:18.300
 the censorship. And so what Bitcoin does, as that specific kind of

41:18.300 --> 41:21.300
 payment network is it says anyone in the world with an internet connection,

41:21.460 --> 41:24.100
 I don't care where you were born, what language you speak, what

41:24.100 --> 41:27.940
 religion you are, your wealth status, your education status, none of it

41:27.940 --> 41:30.940
 matters. If you have an internet connection, you're not going to

41:30.940 --> 41:34.540
 care. If you have an internet connection, you can plug into this

41:34.540 --> 41:38.180
 monetary system. And you can move value around the world to anyone

41:38.180 --> 41:43.060
 else without asking for permission. And in the United States, we

41:43.060 --> 41:45.820
 basically have that ability in the US dollar kind of traditional

41:45.820 --> 41:48.460
 banking system, I can pretty much send money to almost anyone I want

41:48.460 --> 41:50.820
 unless they're a really bad person that's on some list or something.

41:51.860 --> 41:54.900
 Most people in the world don't have that capability. And so what

41:54.900 --> 41:59.820
 you're essentially doing is you're democratizing access to a true store

41:59.820 --> 42:05.620
 value, and a medium of exchange, right. And so what you see in many

42:05.620 --> 42:09.420
 of these countries is that when their currency starts to fail, the

42:09.420 --> 42:13.500
 first thing that a government or a group of people in power and

42:13.500 --> 42:16.980
 influence do is they lock the citizens into the currency with

42:16.980 --> 42:22.220
 capital controls. Why? Because if you let them out, it exasperates

42:22.220 --> 42:27.580
 the problem. And so now what we're seeing is we basically are giving

42:27.580 --> 42:30.940
 a tool to billions of people around the world that is a peaceful

42:30.940 --> 42:36.620
 protest. Right? You and I had no say at all. When not only the

42:36.620 --> 42:38.500
 Federal Reserve and elected officials here in the United

42:38.500 --> 42:41.180
 States, but central banks around the world over the last 12 months

42:41.180 --> 42:44.460
 decided to create trillions of dollars and injected into the

42:44.460 --> 42:47.380
 monetary system. Right? They have arguments, and some of them are

42:47.380 --> 42:49.380
 very good arguments as to why they should do that. They're

42:49.380 --> 42:51.740
 trying to mitigate short term pain. Long term, they'll figure

42:51.740 --> 42:55.940
 out the other issues, right? They have very kind of elaborate and

42:55.940 --> 42:58.660
 well articulated kind of viewpoint as to why they're

42:58.660 --> 43:02.500
 doing it. But you and I had no say. And so when you start to

43:02.500 --> 43:05.540
 look at, we have a very small group of people in this world,

43:06.060 --> 43:08.420
 both in our country and in countries around the world that

43:08.420 --> 43:12.340
 make these decisions that have very, very far reaching kind of

43:12.340 --> 43:16.460
 impact. And on top of that, in many cases, there's actually not

43:16.460 --> 43:19.580
 that much kind of accountability. Because usually

43:19.580 --> 43:21.660
 these are not elected officials who are making some of these

43:21.660 --> 43:24.900
 decisions, these are appointed. And you can argue that, hey, we

43:24.900 --> 43:28.140
 elected somebody who appointed them. But at the same time, that

43:28.140 --> 43:31.300
 accountability isn't quite there. And so I think ultimately,

43:31.300 --> 43:33.940
 when you just back out, you say, you know, what is Bitcoin? Why

43:33.940 --> 43:37.980
 is it important to the world? It is giving access to anyone in

43:37.980 --> 43:40.380
 the world with an internet connection to a store of value

43:40.540 --> 43:43.380
 and a monitoring network that allows them to peacefully

43:43.380 --> 43:48.780
 protest and to opt out of a system that pretty much is not

43:48.780 --> 43:50.860
 working for majority of people in the world.

43:51.260 --> 43:54.020
 So it's moving the power from these centralized places,

43:54.020 --> 43:58.940
 sometimes unelected to the individuals and to the people.

43:59.740 --> 44:04.180
 So the dollar does seem to work for Americans and for many

44:04.180 --> 44:08.500
 people in the world. But you kind of have a vision, you paint

44:08.500 --> 44:11.380
 a picture of a future where potentially we move to

44:11.380 --> 44:15.660
 cryptocurrency. So what kind of trajectory do you see where

44:15.660 --> 44:19.220
 Bitcoin can become the main currency in the world, or at

44:19.220 --> 44:23.220
 least cryptocurrency become the main way of storing value in the

44:23.220 --> 44:25.220
 world and basically overtake the dollar?

44:25.540 --> 44:29.980
 Yeah, so I always go first to we don't need to have competition

44:30.020 --> 44:33.260
 like in terms of like a direct competition between the dollar

44:33.300 --> 44:37.060
 and Bitcoin, right? If you look at most technologies in the

44:37.060 --> 44:40.420
 world, the really valuable ones are actually market expanding

44:40.420 --> 44:44.140
 technologies, rather than simply just market share stealing

44:44.140 --> 44:47.460
 technologies, right. So if you look at Uber, for example, Uber

44:47.460 --> 44:49.740
 didn't just say, Hey, I'm gonna go take out all the taxis,

44:49.900 --> 44:52.900
 right? It actually drastically expanded the market for people

44:52.900 --> 44:55.020
 now there's literally millions of people in the United States

44:55.020 --> 44:57.900
 who don't have cars because they use Uber, right. And so I think

44:57.900 --> 45:02.100
 that Bitcoin is very similar in that, yes, there is a component

45:02.100 --> 45:06.020
 of medium of exchange, in terms of the dollar. But also there is

45:06.020 --> 45:09.140
 this component of just store value assets in general. And so

45:09.140 --> 45:11.860
 when you start to look at Bitcoin, specifically, I think

45:11.860 --> 45:14.700
 that what you're seeing is you're seeing a generational gap,

45:14.860 --> 45:17.900
 where young people say, I grew up with a phone in my hand, I'm

45:17.900 --> 45:20.940
 digitally native, the whole idea of going to the bank and

45:20.940 --> 45:24.820
 sending a wire, or going to an ATM and getting physical cash is

45:24.820 --> 45:27.580
 an antiquated idea in their mind, right? I one time asked my

45:27.580 --> 45:30.180
 brother, he's 24 years old. And I said, Hey, how do you send

45:30.180 --> 45:32.980
 money to your friends? And he gave me one answer, which I

45:32.980 --> 45:35.500
 expected, which was Venmo. And the second answer, I didn't

45:35.500 --> 45:38.940
 expect he said Uber. I said, How do you send money via Uber? He

45:38.940 --> 45:40.860
 said, Well, we get in a car together. And at the end, we

45:40.860 --> 45:44.420
 split the ride. And so again, you and I have probably both

45:44.420 --> 45:47.220
 done that. But I never thought of it as a way to send money to

45:47.220 --> 45:51.100
 each other. And so it is a psychological difference between

45:51.100 --> 45:54.020
 even me, who's only, you know, a decade older than him or so,

45:54.660 --> 45:57.940
 and his peer group. And so I think as we're watching kind of

45:57.940 --> 46:02.220
 Bitcoin continue this ascent, ultimately, what we're seeing is

46:02.260 --> 46:05.580
 an entire generation of kids are saying, Listen, if I look at

46:05.580 --> 46:08.780
 financial assets across the board, I have stocks, I have

46:08.780 --> 46:12.100
 bonds, I have currencies, and I have commodities, I know that

46:12.180 --> 46:16.380
 bonds, from a real rate return perspective, is flat to

46:16.380 --> 46:19.380
 negative, right? I'm gonna make no money on this, because I have

46:19.380 --> 46:23.580
 a belief that my dollar is being devalued. And actually, what

46:23.580 --> 46:26.780
 we're starting to see is, again, the internet has broken down

46:26.780 --> 46:30.140
 these walled gardens and kind of these centralized hubs of

46:30.140 --> 46:33.260
 information, in that if you were to look at, let's say the stock

46:33.260 --> 46:37.980
 market, from 1971 to today, in dollar terms, it's a 45 degree

46:37.980 --> 46:39.900
 angle right up into the right, right, you know, it's kind of

46:39.900 --> 46:44.220
 seven, 810% growth, every year, it's amazing, just get invested

46:44.220 --> 46:45.940
 in the stock market, and you'll make money over a long period of

46:45.940 --> 46:49.060
 time, regardless of the dips along the way. If you do not

46:49.060 --> 46:52.380
 make that same stock market in gold, the stock market is down

46:52.380 --> 46:57.140
 since 1971. And so is it so much that the stock market is accruing

46:57.140 --> 47:00.020
 true value? Or is it that the underlying currency in which it

47:00.020 --> 47:03.700
 is denominated in is being devalued? Right? And I was being

47:03.700 --> 47:06.940
 devalued in a very disciplined way, right, in terms of it's not

47:06.940 --> 47:10.180
 like it went 50% devaluation in a short period of time, but it's

47:10.180 --> 47:13.260
 still being devalued. And so I think that people are waking up

47:13.260 --> 47:16.740
 to this idea that a traditional 6040 type global portfolio

47:16.820 --> 47:21.660
 doesn't work anymore, right? 40% of it in bonds is just not going

47:21.660 --> 47:24.780
 to get it done. And so when you start to look at this, people

47:24.780 --> 47:28.860
 first look at Bitcoin via two main ways, in my opinion, they

47:28.860 --> 47:31.580
 look at it one as a store value, should I actually go and put

47:31.580 --> 47:34.340
 some of my wealth there use it as a savings technology, right?

47:34.340 --> 47:37.340
 We ask people in the traditional world, if you're a teacher, a

47:37.340 --> 47:41.260
 fireman, an accounting, you know, mid level manager, we say,

47:41.260 --> 47:44.100
 hey, go do your job, be best in class as a fireman or as a

47:44.100 --> 47:45.900
 teacher. And then Oh, by the way, you have to be a

47:45.900 --> 47:48.180
 professional investor as well. Because if you just put your

47:48.180 --> 47:50.700
 dollars in your bank account, you're literally going to have

47:50.700 --> 47:54.020
 your wealth devalued away over time. So you can't just save you

47:54.020 --> 47:58.500
 have to invest. That is a really tall task for people, they have

47:58.500 --> 48:00.860
 a hard enough time just doing their job, right? Taking care of

48:00.860 --> 48:03.620
 their family, right? Now they got to go be an investor. So I

48:03.620 --> 48:06.580
 think savings technology for Bitcoin standpoint is, if you

48:06.580 --> 48:11.500
 buy satoshis or Bitcoin, over time, it will increase from a

48:11.500 --> 48:13.420
 purchasing power standpoint, because there's a fixed supply

48:13.420 --> 48:16.700
 and demand continues to rise. But then you start to look at

48:16.700 --> 48:19.820
 well, what other assets do people put in their portfolios,

48:19.980 --> 48:23.900
 whether it's art, it's real estate, precious metals, or

48:23.900 --> 48:27.300
 something else. Most of those assets are not because people

48:27.300 --> 48:29.740
 actually think that they're going to go up in value over

48:29.740 --> 48:33.100
 time, they're using the store of value. Right? The reason why

48:33.100 --> 48:35.660
 somebody buys gold is because the store of value, right

48:35.660 --> 48:39.940
 historically, that's a narrative driven type asset, though,

48:40.100 --> 48:43.060
 right? We tell people it's scarce, we tell people that it

48:43.060 --> 48:46.100
 is a store of value. When you look at it, though, we don't

48:46.100 --> 48:48.620
 know how much gold exists in the world, we have a good estimate,

48:48.700 --> 48:50.980
 right? But we don't actually we can't prove how much there is.

48:51.660 --> 48:53.660
 We don't know how much is coming out of the ground every day.

48:53.700 --> 48:57.300
 Again, great, fantastic estimate. But we can't prove it.

48:57.500 --> 48:59.260
 And we don't know what the total supply and that's what you mean

48:59.260 --> 49:01.380
 by narrative driven, we can't really prove it, like

49:01.380 --> 49:04.140
 mathematically, we you I and everyone else in the world has

49:04.140 --> 49:06.780
 lived in a narrative driven world for the last couple of

49:06.780 --> 49:10.140
 decades, right? And what the internet and digital technologies

49:10.140 --> 49:14.180
 have done is it opened up the possibility and the desire from

49:14.180 --> 49:19.340
 people to have a world now where I can validate things. So when I

49:19.340 --> 49:24.220
 see that headline, I want to see you say whatever happened to the

49:24.220 --> 49:26.340
 news, if you're the subject of the news, rather than have

49:26.340 --> 49:29.620
 somebody else tell me the story. If I see that you say something

49:29.620 --> 49:33.860
 is scarce, prove to me that it is scarce. And so I think that's

49:33.860 --> 49:36.260
 kind of a psychological shift, the younger generation is

49:36.260 --> 49:39.220
 starting to understand because ultimately, you and I probably

49:39.220 --> 49:41.380
 grew up in a world where parents could tell us the story. And we

49:41.380 --> 49:45.260
 just believed it. You know, dad or mom says it must be true. If

49:45.260 --> 49:47.540
 my brother heard a story, what does he do? He goes to Google

49:47.540 --> 49:50.140
 and he looks it up. Randy comes back and usually tells my

49:50.140 --> 49:52.620
 parents, oh, you got the story wrong, right. And so I think

49:52.620 --> 49:56.060
 that that that provability or that that validation ends up

49:56.060 --> 49:57.980
 becoming really, really important. And so, you know,

49:57.980 --> 50:00.460
 look at something like gold, I think that people are

50:00.460 --> 50:03.780
 drastically underestimating the shift that's underway right now.

50:03.780 --> 50:08.820
 Gold is one down in value since April, or I'm sorry, August of

50:08.820 --> 50:13.860
 2020. And so in a timeframe where central banks have had

50:13.860 --> 50:16.540
 historic quantitative using literally $6 trillion in the

50:16.540 --> 50:19.660
 United States, the one asset that historically has been the

50:19.660 --> 50:23.180
 best store of value and has, you know, in 2008 financial crisis

50:23.300 --> 50:26.580
 hit an all time high based on the government response has

50:26.580 --> 50:31.580
 actually suffered for a main part of this financial crisis.

50:32.380 --> 50:34.620
 You then look at central banks around the world who have been

50:34.620 --> 50:37.660
 very large holders of gold for a long time and net buyers on a

50:37.660 --> 50:41.540
 monthly basis. For multiple months, over the last six

50:41.540 --> 50:45.020
 months, they've been net sellers of gold. And then you

50:45.020 --> 50:47.860
 start to look at jewelry demand. So the actual non

50:47.860 --> 50:53.020
 monetary value of gold, and that demand for gold jewelry peaked

50:53.020 --> 50:57.100
 in 2013, and has continued to fall since. And so what you

50:57.100 --> 50:59.740
 start to say to yourself is take just the asset of gold, which

50:59.740 --> 51:03.020
 about $10 trillion market cap, and you say, Okay, well,

51:03.020 --> 51:05.460
 jewelry demand continues to fall, even if it's at a slight

51:05.460 --> 51:08.020
 rate, but it's continues to contract. You have central

51:08.020 --> 51:11.380
 banks that now at some times are net sellers and sometimes net

51:11.380 --> 51:14.620
 buyers, right? So okay, again, contraction there. And then from

51:14.620 --> 51:19.020
 the investment standpoint, the actual price, the daily price of

51:19.020 --> 51:21.940
 this continues to fall, which is a signal that there's a

51:21.940 --> 51:25.100
 contracting demand from an investment perspective. That's

51:25.100 --> 51:29.180
 93% of all use of gold, only 7% of it's used for actual

51:29.180 --> 51:32.300
 technology and metal conduction and things like that. And so

51:32.300 --> 51:36.020
 you have a $10 trillion asset that it appears and again, maybe

51:36.060 --> 51:38.380
 data changes, and I'll change my mind and other people change

51:38.380 --> 51:41.220
 their mind, but it appears is on the decline. And so if that

51:41.220 --> 51:43.620
 happens, you're going to get the contraction of a $10 trillion

51:43.620 --> 51:47.460
 asset, where's all that value go. And what you're seeing is at

51:47.460 --> 51:50.980
 the same time that that asset is contracting, you're also seeing

51:50.980 --> 51:56.340
 a massive influx from not only retail investors, not only kind

51:56.340 --> 51:58.900
 of the wealthy and the elite, but also from financial

51:58.900 --> 52:02.980
 institutions, corporations, pension funds, etc. into this

52:02.980 --> 52:04.380
 kind of digital sound money.

52:04.420 --> 52:07.580
 So you're saying that there's a kind of shift from gold to

52:07.580 --> 52:10.660
 Bitcoin, because they have a lot of the same properties, except

52:10.660 --> 52:13.940
 one is in the physical space, the other is in the digital

52:13.940 --> 52:18.100
 space. So do you see like central banks, quietly

52:18.100 --> 52:24.380
 potentially switching out from sort of gold to Bitcoin, like

52:24.380 --> 52:28.900
 naturally just doing is seeing a pattern that you're referring

52:28.900 --> 52:31.660
 to now, but more drastically into the future, where there's

52:31.660 --> 52:32.580
 a complete shift,

52:32.660 --> 52:35.020
 if you line up the gold community and the Bitcoin

52:35.020 --> 52:37.380
 community next to each other, they'll agree on all the

52:37.380 --> 52:41.100
 problems that they that they see in the world, right? They'll

52:41.100 --> 52:43.900
 actually agree on the solution that sound money is the solution

52:43.900 --> 52:47.500
 where they differentiate is the gold communities believes that

52:47.500 --> 52:50.660
 it's the analog application of sound money, right? The physical

52:50.660 --> 52:53.860
 gold, that is the solution. The Bitcoin community believes the

52:53.860 --> 52:56.500
 digital application of sound money, Bitcoin, can you define

52:56.500 --> 52:59.020
 sound money, by the way, someone is just outside the system, and

52:59.020 --> 53:01.700
 no one can create more of it. So nobody controls it. This is

53:01.700 --> 53:05.500
 scarcity is fundamental. Exactly why scarcity important in money?

53:06.020 --> 53:09.660
 I think scarcity just has this very high correlation to value

53:09.660 --> 53:12.140
 across all assets, not just money, right? Money happens to

53:12.140 --> 53:15.820
 be the unit of account that we use in terms of daily commerce.

53:16.460 --> 53:21.380
 But whether it is, you know, as we're seeing now, sneakers, or

53:21.420 --> 53:24.540
 you know, whatever it is, scarcity, ultimately, is that

53:24.540 --> 53:27.860
 signal of value, I think, and that's just been the way that

53:27.860 --> 53:31.140
 humans derive value for literally, you know, thousands

53:31.140 --> 53:33.740
 and thousands of years. Yeah, I gotta say, that's my view on

53:33.740 --> 53:37.700
 life and love in general, is scarcity is what makes it

53:38.060 --> 53:40.220
 valuable. People talk about immortality.

53:40.220 --> 53:43.820
 You know, I would like to be immortal, but it does, it does

53:43.820 --> 53:50.460
 seem that when you let go of the finiteness of life, I feel like

53:50.900 --> 53:56.500
 that meals and the experiences you have get devalued

53:56.500 --> 54:00.860
 significantly, like, the longer you live, the less value there

54:00.860 --> 54:05.540
 are in infinity, if you live forever, I worry that all the

54:05.540 --> 54:08.820
 meaning will dissipate. And the same thing with love, I think

54:08.820 --> 54:11.220
 criticism of sort of dating culture and all that kind of

54:11.220 --> 54:15.580
 stuff. Like I haven't had shocking revelation that I've

54:15.580 --> 54:19.060
 never been on a tinder date or any of those things. I believe

54:19.060 --> 54:24.660
 that scarcity in dating and interaction is like, intensifies

54:24.660 --> 54:28.140
 the value of when the interactions do happen. So, when

54:28.140 --> 54:31.980
 they like when love does happen. And so in that sense, there's

54:31.980 --> 54:34.900
 something magical about scarcity in the more subjective

54:34.900 --> 54:38.860
 psychological social world, as well. And perhaps money is just

54:38.860 --> 54:41.260
 another version of that, right? It's just it's all about the

54:41.260 --> 54:43.420
 stories and ideas we tell ourselves.

54:43.540 --> 54:46.060
 I think they're actually more interconnected than you're

54:46.060 --> 54:49.420
 giving it credit for, right? Which is, what is money? Money

54:49.420 --> 54:56.420
 is time, ultimately, right? The pursuit of the acquisition of

54:56.420 --> 55:00.460
 money, right, of whether it's a currency or true money, is

55:00.460 --> 55:04.060
 because that should give you more time, right? And that's

55:04.060 --> 55:06.820
 what would give you more time. And so one of my favorite

55:06.820 --> 55:10.740
 movies ever is, and it's funny, because Justin Timberlake is in

55:10.740 --> 55:14.820
 it, is this movie in a lot of me, I lose most people at that

55:14.820 --> 55:17.900
 point, in time, in time. And basically, the premise of the

55:17.900 --> 55:21.060
 movie is that everyone has a clock that is embedded into

55:21.060 --> 55:25.900
 their arm. And so if you go to work, you basically put your

55:25.900 --> 55:28.220
 arm underneath when you leave, and there's time that's

55:28.220 --> 55:31.220
 deposited into your clock. And if your clock ever hits all

55:31.220 --> 55:35.300
 the arrows, you're dead, you die on the spot. And so there's

55:35.300 --> 55:38.180
 a number of scenes where people are basically running, you know,

55:38.180 --> 55:40.260
 to get to you, and I give you a little bit more time so that

55:40.260 --> 55:43.220
 you can get to work on Monday, and then you work to acquire

55:43.220 --> 55:46.460
 time. And so basically, time becomes this currency. But what

55:46.460 --> 55:49.620
 becomes very fascinating about it is there are sections in

55:49.620 --> 55:53.340
 society, where literally, there's physical places, if you

55:53.340 --> 55:57.140
 only have, let's say, 72 hours or less, you're allowed to go to

55:57.140 --> 56:00.220
 Section One. Section Five, though, is because you have

56:00.220 --> 56:03.900
 years and years and years on your clock. And in this movie,

56:03.940 --> 56:08.900
 everyone at the age of 25 freezes from a biological aging

56:08.900 --> 56:12.060
 standpoint. So everyone stays the same, but you may have lived

56:12.060 --> 56:16.180
 for 1000 years. And so what becomes so fascinating about it

56:16.460 --> 56:20.500
 is that rich people have time, poor people do not have time.

56:21.020 --> 56:23.980
 And so in it, Justin Timberlake, the main character at one

56:23.980 --> 56:27.860
 point, essentially acquires a bunch of time, and he's able to

56:27.860 --> 56:32.180
 go to one of the higher levels. And now he's attending all these

56:32.180 --> 56:35.300
 galas and, you know, poker nights and all this stuff. And

56:35.300 --> 56:39.580
 one of the first things that he learns is that in the lower end

56:39.580 --> 56:43.060
 of society, everyone is running everywhere at all times in the

56:43.060 --> 56:46.740
 movie, because time is so finite, and it is so scarce.

56:46.820 --> 56:49.500
 And so therefore, why would I walk down the street, I must run

56:49.500 --> 56:54.940
 down the street. In the highest level of society, no one runs

56:54.940 --> 56:58.620
 anywhere. And in fact, if you run, you are seen as lower

56:58.620 --> 57:03.100
 class. Yeah, because wealth is time. And so that movie is, you

57:03.100 --> 57:05.780
 know, it's got a ton of kind of things that you can pull out of

57:05.780 --> 57:10.100
 it, but to me is the perfect epitome of money is time. And so

57:10.100 --> 57:14.820
 when you start to think about the acquisition of money, right,

57:14.820 --> 57:17.140
 it goes to this whole idea of time billionaire. And I know

57:17.140 --> 57:20.100
 that there's probably a lot of people who've heard about this

57:20.100 --> 57:24.900
 already. But if you think of a million seconds, it's about 11

57:24.900 --> 57:30.580
 days, a billion seconds is 31 years. And so if I said to

57:30.580 --> 57:34.220
 somebody, you have to switch lives with Warren Buffett,

57:34.820 --> 57:38.180
 would you do it? Some people would say, Sure, that'd be

57:38.180 --> 57:41.100
 their initial reaction. But you got have to be you know, 92

57:41.100 --> 57:46.060
 years old, is the money worth the lack of time? Most people

57:46.060 --> 57:48.780
 would say no, right? And there's this guy, Graham Duncan, who

57:48.780 --> 57:52.700
 really articulated this well. And ultimately, what ends up

57:52.700 --> 57:54.980
 happening is you rest time is more valuable than the money.

57:55.340 --> 58:00.300
 But the you acquire the money to gain more time. And the reason

58:00.300 --> 58:03.580
 is valuable is because of the scarcity of time. We currently

58:03.580 --> 58:10.300
 have the by the biology, the physics means that this is not

58:10.300 --> 58:13.180
 just the narrative we tell ourselves, maybe it is, I don't

58:13.180 --> 58:18.820
 know, but it feels like pretty sure we're mortal. And in that

58:18.820 --> 58:22.620
 sense, the scarcity there gives value to time, it's fascinating

58:22.620 --> 58:26.380
 to think about all the thought experiments here of if that

58:26.380 --> 58:28.780
 could actually be on the economy, if you can actually

58:28.780 --> 58:32.620
 convert time in a frictionless way to money.

58:33.140 --> 58:35.740
 Well, and if you start to pull on this a little bit and say,

58:35.740 --> 58:38.340
 okay, a young person today, let's say somebody in their

58:38.380 --> 58:41.860
 20s, has about 2 billion seconds left in their life, right, kind

58:41.860 --> 58:47.260
 of 60 years, give or take, based on life expectancy. They

58:47.500 --> 58:51.660
 usually, until they start to understand this concept, think

58:51.660 --> 58:57.500
 of wealth in dollar terms. But dollars are being devalued. And

58:57.500 --> 59:00.140
 so you know, a million dollars doesn't get you what it used to

59:00.140 --> 59:03.340
 get, right is kind of an old adage. And so what you're doing

59:03.340 --> 59:07.540
 is you're pursuing something that ends up losing value. And

59:07.540 --> 59:11.220
 so it's the constant rat race, it's how do I constantly try to

59:11.220 --> 59:13.020
 get more? How do I get more dollars? How do I get more

59:13.020 --> 59:15.900
 dollars? Because even if I say to myself, you know, I'm going

59:15.900 --> 59:21.340
 to retire when I get $100,000. When I get the $100,000, the

59:21.340 --> 59:23.740
 $100,000 five years from now doesn't buy me what I thought it

59:23.740 --> 59:27.340
 did. So now I need 500,000 or 200,000 or a million or whatever

59:27.340 --> 59:29.860
 the number is. And so ultimately, what ends up

59:29.900 --> 59:33.660
 occurring is that the Bitcoin community and many people in

59:33.660 --> 59:36.980
 kind of this idea of sound money is you want to be able to

59:36.980 --> 59:41.540
 acquire an asset that not only will hold the value, right, the

59:41.540 --> 59:45.340
 store of value over time, but it will actually appreciate over

59:45.340 --> 59:48.860
 time. And so when you look at something like Bitcoin against

59:48.860 --> 59:51.940
 the dollar against other types of assets, all of these assets

59:51.940 --> 59:55.100
 are down compared to Bitcoin, right? Now, some of that's just

59:55.220 --> 59:58.660
 in the early days of kind of the pricing of an asset, you go from

59:58.660 --> 1:00:01.780
 very small to something much larger. But now what you start

1:00:01.780 --> 1:00:04.540
 to look at is well, if you have a finite supply of something,

1:00:05.140 --> 1:00:09.980
 what ends up happening is people begin to value it more. And so

1:00:10.260 --> 1:00:13.740
 in a world where dollars are infinite, and other fiat

1:00:13.740 --> 1:00:17.660
 currencies are infinite, Bitcoin becomes very, very interesting,

1:00:17.660 --> 1:00:21.860
 very special, and something that is very aspirational. And so I

1:00:21.860 --> 1:00:23.300
 think that's where you're starting to see people say,

1:00:23.300 --> 1:00:28.260
 wait a second, this is something where that finite, secure store

1:00:28.260 --> 1:00:32.580
 of value is essential to wealth generation and preservation over

1:00:32.580 --> 1:00:33.380
 a long period of time.

1:00:33.980 --> 1:00:37.540
 And if Sam Harris is right, that free will is an illusion. This

1:00:37.540 --> 1:00:42.460
 is really interesting to think about. Maybe time is a kind of

1:00:42.460 --> 1:00:46.540
 blockchain, because you can't change anything. And then the

1:00:46.540 --> 1:00:54.580
 physical space time of the universe is a ledger. So maybe

1:00:55.060 --> 1:00:58.580
 it won't be Bitcoin that replaces gold, maybe it'll be

1:00:58.700 --> 1:01:03.100
 time, once we crack open that, in fact, the universe is fully

1:01:03.100 --> 1:01:05.900
 deterministic. So maybe that's what like Eric Weinstein is

1:01:05.900 --> 1:01:09.700
 afraid of, once you figure out the theories of everything of

1:01:09.700 --> 1:01:15.220
 physics, we'll be able to then start trading, create a market

1:01:15.220 --> 1:01:19.700
 out of like the very fabric of reality. And that way break it.

1:01:19.780 --> 1:01:25.060
 Well, if you look at infinite inflationary type currencies,

1:01:25.380 --> 1:01:27.900
 you can't do that, right? Because it constantly is losing

1:01:27.900 --> 1:01:31.780
 value. When you look at a finite asset, again, that has the

1:01:31.780 --> 1:01:36.900
 provability of the actual finite element to it. Ultimately, the

1:01:36.900 --> 1:01:42.820
 wealth is that marketplace. Yeah. And so, you know, I always

1:01:42.820 --> 1:01:47.140
 kind of try to highlight for people, the top 55% of Americans

1:01:47.380 --> 1:01:51.460
 understand something that the bottom 45% don't, they invest,

1:01:51.940 --> 1:01:56.780
 right, the bottom 45% consume the top 55% invest. And that's

1:01:56.780 --> 1:01:59.700
 why we have a wealth inequality gap. And it continues to get

1:01:59.740 --> 1:02:02.620
 wider and wider and wider is because the people who are

1:02:02.620 --> 1:02:06.660
 holding the devaluing assets, and saving are watching their

1:02:06.660 --> 1:02:09.260
 wealth be devalued away. And there's arguments and

1:02:09.260 --> 1:02:11.980
 controversy over how fast that's happening, but it's

1:02:11.980 --> 1:02:15.460
 happening. The people who are holding the assets that have any

1:02:15.460 --> 1:02:18.380
 level of scarcity, right, real estate may not be finite, but

1:02:18.380 --> 1:02:22.660
 it's scarce, right? Art may not be finite, but it's scarce. Gold

1:02:22.660 --> 1:02:26.580
 may not be finite, but it's scarce. Those assets continue to

1:02:26.620 --> 1:02:30.300
 appreciate against the devaluing currency. And so when

1:02:30.300 --> 1:02:35.140
 you then say, No, I have complete finite supply, with

1:02:35.140 --> 1:02:38.180
 provability, and this transparency around it, where

1:02:38.180 --> 1:02:41.940
 everyone knows how much is there and what where it's going. And

1:02:41.940 --> 1:02:45.300
 now all of a sudden, you and I can transact back and forth that

1:02:45.300 --> 1:02:48.460
 value. And it is a representation of time. Because

1:02:48.460 --> 1:02:51.860
 what I can essentially do is if I gather or acquire more of

1:02:51.860 --> 1:02:57.500
 that wealth, I then can apply leverage to my life. I can use

1:02:57.500 --> 1:03:03.820
 machines, humans, or some other resources. And basically now

1:03:03.860 --> 1:03:05.020
 free up my time.

1:03:05.100 --> 1:03:07.660
 Yeah, and it's not fun about the way you are trading time.

1:03:07.660 --> 1:03:12.260
 Maybe it's a little bit indirect, but maybe not. So just

1:03:12.260 --> 1:03:15.500
 because I brought up Eric and you're on Twitter, I'd love to

1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:19.620
 hear your opinions. I talk to him a lot. He seems to have

1:03:19.620 --> 1:03:23.780
 stepped into the beautiful dance of human communication and the

1:03:23.780 --> 1:03:26.340
 social dynamics that is the Bitcoin cryptocurrency

1:03:26.340 --> 1:03:33.780
 community. Do you have thoughts on gauge, theoretic concepts,

1:03:33.780 --> 1:03:37.740
 conceptualization of the world, or just Eric in general? He's

1:03:37.740 --> 1:03:40.860
 got a lot of love in his heart, and he's got a grace in the way

1:03:40.860 --> 1:03:46.660
 he communicates. But he's also loves to play with ideas and

1:03:46.660 --> 1:03:49.460
 seems to have touched a sensitive point with the Bitcoin

1:03:49.460 --> 1:03:52.900
 community. Is there anything you could say that's hopeful,

1:03:52.900 --> 1:03:55.940
 inspiring about that whole dynamic that went down?

1:03:56.700 --> 1:04:00.100
 So I don't know all the details. But what I will say is I've

1:04:00.100 --> 1:04:03.820
 listened to a number of his podcasts, and him and there's a

1:04:03.820 --> 1:04:07.340
 whole bunch of people like him. I basically put them in the

1:04:07.340 --> 1:04:10.660
 bucket of they're an independent thinker who are courageous

1:04:10.660 --> 1:04:15.820
 enough to speak their truth, whatever that may be. They are

1:04:15.820 --> 1:04:20.740
 humble enough to revisit their ideas and say, I got this right,

1:04:20.780 --> 1:04:23.020
 I got this wrong information change, I'll change my mind.

1:04:23.500 --> 1:04:25.900
 Obviously, a sign of intelligence to be able to do

1:04:25.900 --> 1:04:28.380
 that type of stuff. And I actually think that one of the

1:04:28.380 --> 1:04:30.820
 most scarce things in our society are those independent

1:04:30.820 --> 1:04:33.620
 thinkers who are able to do all this. Right? Speaking of

1:04:33.620 --> 1:04:38.460
 scarcity. Yeah. And so to me, I put Eric and the whole host of

1:04:38.460 --> 1:04:40.780
 other people kind of, if you look at like the intellectual

1:04:40.780 --> 1:04:44.460
 dark web is kind of a label that's been used. They're

1:04:44.460 --> 1:04:47.100
 actually some of the most important people in our society,

1:04:47.420 --> 1:04:50.020
 because they're the people who are willing to stand up against

1:04:50.020 --> 1:04:54.340
 the mass kind of thought process. They're willing to talk

1:04:54.340 --> 1:04:57.100
 about things that others may think are taboo, right? They're

1:04:57.100 --> 1:05:00.340
 willing to change their mind, which all of a sudden has become

1:05:00.340 --> 1:05:04.020
 a bad thing rather than a good thing. And so when I see the

1:05:04.020 --> 1:05:08.140
 exploration of ideas in public, I actually think that those are

1:05:08.140 --> 1:05:12.740
 the people who are most open to the kind of VM it blowback as

1:05:12.740 --> 1:05:15.700
 well. Right? Because that's part of what they're doing is that

1:05:15.700 --> 1:05:18.100
 they're eliciting, hey, I'm going to throw an idea into the

1:05:18.100 --> 1:05:20.660
 arena. If it doesn't get attacked, they actually may be

1:05:20.660 --> 1:05:23.620
 more nervous than if there is some level of, you know, kind of

1:05:23.620 --> 1:05:26.620
 war of attrition, if you will. And so what I've seen with a

1:05:26.620 --> 1:05:29.180
 number of the people who have done this, everyone from some of

1:05:29.180 --> 1:05:31.100
 the best, you know, hedge fund managers and kind of money

1:05:31.100 --> 1:05:33.260
 managers in the world, all the way to what I'll consider some

1:05:33.260 --> 1:05:37.740
 of the most intellectual people in the world is they play with

1:05:37.740 --> 1:05:40.020
 these ideas. And they play with the ideas and they play with

1:05:40.020 --> 1:05:42.300
 them and they put them and they all arrive at the same

1:05:42.300 --> 1:05:45.180
 conclusion. And sometimes it takes a month, sometimes it

1:05:45.180 --> 1:05:49.060
 takes years, but they arrive at this Bitcoin thesis. And what's

1:05:49.060 --> 1:05:52.740
 so interesting about it is it highlights something that many

1:05:52.740 --> 1:05:56.140
 people view as a bug. But I think people in the Bitcoin

1:05:56.140 --> 1:05:59.940
 community view as a feature, which is that community. And so

1:05:59.940 --> 1:06:02.940
 what ends up happening is when you have something that is as

1:06:02.940 --> 1:06:07.820
 ambitious as creating a global reserve currency doesn't mean

1:06:07.820 --> 1:06:10.060
 needs to unseat any of the existing ones, but become the

1:06:10.060 --> 1:06:12.500
 global reserve currency of the internet, right, this digital

1:06:12.500 --> 1:06:16.260
 economy, you need shepherds of it. And so just like a

1:06:16.260 --> 1:06:19.260
 technology company wants to find those loyal fans that are

1:06:19.260 --> 1:06:22.740
 willing to go out and market and word of mouth and, and kind of

1:06:22.740 --> 1:06:27.980
 not only promote it, but also protect it. This technology

1:06:27.980 --> 1:06:31.260
 that is this decentralized thing, which uses a financial

1:06:31.260 --> 1:06:35.460
 incentive in order to elicit the buy in, not from a financial

1:06:35.460 --> 1:06:39.940
 perspective, but from a mental energy standpoint, has built one

1:06:39.940 --> 1:06:44.500
 of the most rabid, powerful and engaged communities on the

1:06:44.500 --> 1:06:48.660
 internet. And what ends up happening is those people have

1:06:48.660 --> 1:06:52.940
 thought more about these ideas, and actually challenged those

1:06:52.940 --> 1:06:56.260
 ideas more than anyone else in the world. And so I've got a lot

1:06:56.260 --> 1:06:59.100
 of folks who will just say, there's this guy Marty Bent, who

1:06:59.100 --> 1:07:02.660
 will talk all the time about the Bitcoin critics haven't done

1:07:02.660 --> 1:07:05.260
 their homework in a lot of cases. So they show up and

1:07:05.260 --> 1:07:07.580
 sometimes it's super intellectual, lazy arguments,

1:07:07.620 --> 1:07:10.180
 sometimes actually very well thought out arguments, you know,

1:07:10.180 --> 1:07:13.500
 on the counter to the Bitcoin thesis. But ultimately, what

1:07:13.500 --> 1:07:16.180
 ends up happening is you're talking to somebody who's an

1:07:16.180 --> 1:07:18.700
 expert, they've been thinking about for five, seven, eight, 10

1:07:18.700 --> 1:07:20.580
 years, right? They've gone through every simulation you

1:07:20.580 --> 1:07:25.060
 possibly can. And they show up with data, examples, and

1:07:25.060 --> 1:07:27.940
 responses. Now, they're not always right. But they've just

1:07:27.940 --> 1:07:31.340
 done the work. And so what I actually like about folks like

1:07:31.340 --> 1:07:33.460
 Eric and others is as they're kind of going through this

1:07:33.460 --> 1:07:36.900
 journey, they're incredibly smart, right? And they provide,

1:07:37.340 --> 1:07:41.060
 or they apply a lot of intellectual rigor to some of

1:07:41.060 --> 1:07:43.540
 these arguments. And so what it does is what does it do? It's a

1:07:43.540 --> 1:07:48.060
 marketplace. It keeps people honest. Let me sort of make a

1:07:48.060 --> 1:07:50.540
 few comments. It's kind of interesting. So you're exactly

1:07:50.540 --> 1:07:54.940
 right. Maybe the blowback is part of the mechanism that

1:07:54.940 --> 1:07:57.660
 actually develops these ideas and so on. I do want to kind of

1:07:57.660 --> 1:08:01.540
 speak to a little bit of the toxicity that I've experienced

1:08:01.540 --> 1:08:04.340
 in the Bitcoin community. I kind of see it, the Bitcoin

1:08:04.340 --> 1:08:06.940
 community, I think you paint a really nice picture, which I

1:08:06.940 --> 1:08:10.540
 kind of see it as an immune system that protects against

1:08:10.540 --> 1:08:17.140
 sort of the viruses that are bad ideas. That said, the immune

1:08:17.140 --> 1:08:21.900
 system can destroy a body, right? And the thing you

1:08:21.900 --> 1:08:25.780
 mentioned about Eric and maybe about myself, and in general,

1:08:25.780 --> 1:08:29.940
 just people exploring ideas, is there is a Dunning Kruger

1:08:29.940 --> 1:08:34.060
 effect, which is when you first start exploring ideas deeply,

1:08:34.540 --> 1:08:39.420
 you have an overblown level of confidence about like how much

1:08:39.420 --> 1:08:42.020
 you understand. And that's actually the process about

1:08:42.020 --> 1:08:44.380
 learning, then you realize you don't understand much. What

1:08:44.380 --> 1:08:48.860
 I've noticed with the Bitcoin community is they're not as

1:08:49.140 --> 1:08:52.780
 patient with the basics of the Dunning Kruger effect. Like if

1:08:52.780 --> 1:08:58.220
 I step in and make declarative statements about Bitcoin, like

1:08:58.500 --> 1:09:03.940
 I, you know, I read a long time ago, the white paper, like at

1:09:03.940 --> 1:09:08.980
 the cursory level, I felt that I understand the technology,

1:09:08.980 --> 1:09:11.620
 this is basic intuitions. You know, I didn't think about the

1:09:11.620 --> 1:09:14.260
 social dynamics. I didn't think about any like financial

1:09:14.260 --> 1:09:17.620
 implications and a lot of the deep, actually the ongoing

1:09:17.620 --> 1:09:20.100
 innovations and all that kind of stuff. But I thought I

1:09:20.100 --> 1:09:22.260
 understood that technology. And so I step in and make

1:09:22.260 --> 1:09:25.540
 declarative statements. I think those are the first time you

1:09:25.540 --> 1:09:28.100
 say, okay, what's the role of Bitcoin in the world? You start

1:09:28.100 --> 1:09:31.860
 thinking about it deeply. And then you make statements. The

1:09:31.860 --> 1:09:36.020
 toxicity that you get in those first few statements is really

1:09:36.020 --> 1:09:38.900
 off putting to me. I'm somebody that tries to communicate love

1:09:38.900 --> 1:09:44.900
 and live that with everything I do. And there is a level of

1:09:44.900 --> 1:09:48.020
 disrespect that I've experienced, not directly just

1:09:48.020 --> 1:09:51.300
 observing others, people have been mostly kind to me. And I

1:09:51.300 --> 1:09:55.940
 appreciate that. But if you're going to criticize me about my

1:09:55.940 --> 1:09:59.540
 exploration of ideas in Bitcoin, you have to also

1:09:59.540 --> 1:10:02.740
 acknowledge that I'm a human being that got like a PhD in

1:10:02.740 --> 1:10:06.900
 stuff. Like I did some hard shit that it could be in farming or

1:10:06.900 --> 1:10:09.780
 it could be in whatever. Like I've lived life and I've

1:10:09.780 --> 1:10:12.500
 really thought deeply and I really care. Like I know a lot

1:10:12.500 --> 1:10:17.540
 of shit. And it's possible that I actually have a lot of ideas

1:10:17.540 --> 1:10:22.100
 that you can learn from. Now, if it's agriculture, fine. Or if

1:10:22.100 --> 1:10:25.060
 it's artificial intelligence, fine. Like I know what I'm

1:10:25.060 --> 1:10:27.780
 talking about, about certain things. And I could be wrong

1:10:27.780 --> 1:10:29.940
 about a lot of things. And there's like an exchange of

1:10:29.940 --> 1:10:35.620
 ideas that makes that mechanism that you talked about more

1:10:35.620 --> 1:10:38.660
 efficient. Sometimes when the blowback is too strong too

1:10:38.660 --> 1:10:42.660
 early on, the development of ideas is just inefficient. And

1:10:42.660 --> 1:10:46.900
 I'm not sure if there's a, you know, the way it was explained

1:10:46.900 --> 1:10:53.940
 to me is that for so long, that community was like bombarded

1:10:53.940 --> 1:10:58.100
 with just like bad ideas, like criticisms. They're just overly

1:10:58.100 --> 1:11:03.860
 sensitive now to bullshit. They're like triggered by

1:11:03.860 --> 1:11:07.060
 statements. They've heard it all before and they're like,

1:11:07.060 --> 1:11:10.500
 oh, there they go again with the same old arguments. But

1:11:10.500 --> 1:11:14.660
 that doesn't mean that you have to sort of, I guess, develop

1:11:14.660 --> 1:11:18.420
 patience and so on. Especially when you feel like in my case

1:11:18.420 --> 1:11:20.820
 that the person is coming from a good place, right? I don't

1:11:20.820 --> 1:11:23.940
 know if there's something you could say that's positive about

1:11:23.940 --> 1:11:26.500
 the future of this kind of overcoming this toxicity.

1:11:26.500 --> 1:11:29.300
 I think there's a couple of trends that are all kind of

1:11:29.300 --> 1:11:32.580
 coalescing here in these types of experiences. So one is when

1:11:32.580 --> 1:11:35.860
 you look at a community, there's always a spectrum in

1:11:35.860 --> 1:11:39.460
 terms of there's some people who over index on kindness and

1:11:39.460 --> 1:11:41.700
 stupidity. And there's some people who over index on

1:11:41.700 --> 1:11:45.300
 intelligence and basically just being an asshole. And then you

1:11:45.300 --> 1:11:48.740
 get everyone in between. And so naturally, as we know, the

1:11:48.740 --> 1:11:52.740
 extremist ends of any community end up being the loudest

1:11:52.740 --> 1:11:58.820
 usually. The second thing is there is from the outsider

1:11:58.820 --> 1:12:02.580
 view, like at the beginning of the exploration of ideas, it's

1:12:02.580 --> 1:12:06.740
 very much a learning process. I don't know if I understand

1:12:06.740 --> 1:12:11.140
 this or not, but here's ideas A, B, and C. From the internal

1:12:11.140 --> 1:12:14.660
 perspective, there's a trillion dollars of value at stake and

1:12:14.660 --> 1:12:18.500
 we must protect it with our lives. The truth is probably

1:12:18.500 --> 1:12:21.460
 somewhere in between there. And again, the world's not black

1:12:21.460 --> 1:12:24.260
 and white. There's this kind of more gray area that I think

1:12:24.260 --> 1:12:28.020
 actually is where most people exist. The other thing that's

1:12:28.020 --> 1:12:32.500
 at play here is I think the Bitcoin community understands

1:12:32.500 --> 1:12:35.940
 the internet and internet culture and narratives better

1:12:35.940 --> 1:12:39.540
 than almost anyone. And so you see this with kind of the just

1:12:39.540 --> 1:12:44.500
 complete destruction of narratives with memes and just

1:12:44.500 --> 1:12:48.020
 the visceral reaction and the use of things like Reddit and

1:12:48.020 --> 1:12:53.140
 Twitter and YouTube, podcasts, just areas where I think a lot

1:12:53.140 --> 1:12:58.580
 about if you are an upstart and you are going to go challenge

1:12:58.580 --> 1:13:03.700
 the most well respected elite kind of establishment

1:13:03.700 --> 1:13:07.940
 institutions in the world, if you walk in in a suit and tie

1:13:07.940 --> 1:13:12.260
 and you say, I'm here to debate you with ideas, you're going to

1:13:12.260 --> 1:13:15.780
 get your clock cleaned because they're going to trot out their

1:13:15.780 --> 1:13:18.900
 lawyers, their regulators, their lobbyists, right? Like all this

1:13:18.900 --> 1:13:23.060
 stuff. If you instead say, I'm going to meme you to death on

1:13:23.060 --> 1:13:26.020
 the internet and I'm going to control the public narrative.

1:13:26.020 --> 1:13:29.220
 You've shifted the power. The asymmetry of power is more

1:13:29.220 --> 1:13:32.660
 symmetrical now. It's the ultimate insurgency, right? If

1:13:32.660 --> 1:13:36.180
 you bring it back to the the conflict. Yes. And so when you

1:13:36.180 --> 1:13:39.460
 think about this, you have to lean into the advantage that

1:13:39.460 --> 1:13:44.900
 you have. And so what ends up happening is you and I would

1:13:44.900 --> 1:13:48.660
 absolutely lose it if we saw JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs or the

1:13:48.660 --> 1:13:52.420
 Federal Reserve start tweeting memes. Yeah, right. It it would

1:13:52.420 --> 1:13:56.180
 almost the the validation that would give to the medium and

1:13:56.180 --> 1:14:01.380
 the even playing field that it would provide would pull these

1:14:01.380 --> 1:14:06.020
 establishments down to the level of what is this upstart?

1:14:06.020 --> 1:14:08.660
 But now what you're starting to see is that the Bitcoin

1:14:08.660 --> 1:14:13.300
 community, even though there's some level of toxicity at

1:14:13.300 --> 1:14:16.820
 times, even though there's this visceral reaction, sometimes

1:14:16.820 --> 1:14:21.460
 there's even what I would call bullying or or or kind of

1:14:21.460 --> 1:14:23.780
 outward projection of things, right? Even though it may be a

1:14:23.780 --> 1:14:26.980
 small percentage, it'll happen every once in a while. What

1:14:26.980 --> 1:14:30.100
 they do understand, though, is that these establishments are

1:14:30.100 --> 1:14:33.300
 made up of humans. And what you can actually do, one of the

1:14:33.300 --> 1:14:37.460
 best ways to pick apart an institution is to recruit from

1:14:37.460 --> 1:14:41.220
 inside of them one by one. Yes. And so what you're starting

1:14:41.220 --> 1:14:44.420
 to see now is I mean, I get the messages on Twitter and

1:14:44.420 --> 1:14:47.940
 LinkedIn all the time. Hey, I'm a banker by trade, but I'm a

1:14:47.940 --> 1:14:51.620
 bitcoiner at heart, right? And so what you're doing is you're

1:14:51.620 --> 1:14:55.300
 essentially infiltrating the organizations, not in in

1:14:55.300 --> 1:15:00.500
 physical, you know, population. Yeah. But with the ideas and

1:15:00.500 --> 1:15:04.260
 with the philosophies, banker in the streets, bitcoiner in the

1:15:04.260 --> 1:15:10.100
 sheets. Yeah. Okay. I like it. With that said, in terms of

1:15:10.100 --> 1:15:17.940
 shitposting and memes, I gotta say like bring it on because I

1:15:17.940 --> 1:15:22.100
 believe in terms of asymmetry of power, I believe in that

1:15:22.100 --> 1:15:28.020
 love will save the world, not memes. Or at least good vibe

1:15:28.020 --> 1:15:31.380
 memes as opposed to shitposting. It's an interesting

1:15:31.380 --> 1:15:34.100
 battleground, though. It's an interesting battleground to

1:15:34.100 --> 1:15:37.300
 think about. The other thing I would say, too, is one of the

1:15:37.300 --> 1:15:42.020
 elements that's always kind of funny to me is how much of the

1:15:42.020 --> 1:15:45.620
 entertainment is love, right? So, when you start to think

1:15:45.620 --> 1:15:48.340
 about how many of the memes that are posted, for example,

1:15:48.340 --> 1:15:52.340
 are for outsiders versus insiders. Yes. Laser eyes,

1:15:52.340 --> 1:15:56.260
 right? Which seems absolutely ridiculous, elementary, and

1:15:56.260 --> 1:16:00.500
 frankly, beneath anyone in any level of power or influence in

1:16:00.500 --> 1:16:03.700
 the world somehow has congressmen and senators who

1:16:03.700 --> 1:16:07.540
 have done it. Yeah. They're not trying to convince their

1:16:07.540 --> 1:16:11.380
 colleagues in elected positions to become bitcoiners. Yeah.

1:16:11.380 --> 1:16:13.540
 They're speaking directly internally to the Bitcoin

1:16:13.540 --> 1:16:17.140
 community. Yeah, there's some sense in which, yes, memes is

1:16:17.140 --> 1:16:21.380
 love. Even I keep hearing Bitcoin is love. They're trying

1:16:21.380 --> 1:16:26.340
 to convert me. The one that you have to laugh at, right?

1:16:26.340 --> 1:16:28.260
 Probably my favorite one out of all of it is I've seen on

1:16:28.260 --> 1:16:31.940
 multiple occasions, you know, Mark Cuban a couple of years

1:16:31.940 --> 1:16:35.140
 ago, Kevin O Leary, whoever, you know, wealthy people,

1:16:35.140 --> 1:16:38.100
 billionaires, etcetera, and you have people on anonymous

1:16:38.100 --> 1:16:40.500
 accounts who who knows who they are telling them have fun

1:16:40.500 --> 1:16:45.460
 staying poor, right? It's just, you know, it's just, again,

1:16:45.460 --> 1:16:48.660
 part of a community and I think it's a feature, not a bug.

1:16:48.660 --> 1:16:52.260
 There's bad aspects to it at times but I do think it's a net

1:16:52.260 --> 1:16:56.100
 positive. Yeah, just like the immune system. It does a lot of

1:16:56.100 --> 1:17:01.460
 crappy stuff but overall, it's a major net positive. Maybe

1:17:01.460 --> 1:17:03.860
 this is a bit of a personal question for me. It just added

1:17:03.860 --> 1:17:07.540
 my own curiosity but I've talked to Ray Dalio a few

1:17:07.540 --> 1:17:10.900
 times. So, Ray Dalio, I think was one of those people that

1:17:10.900 --> 1:17:16.260
 took that journey, the Bitcoin journey. Do you have thoughts

1:17:16.260 --> 1:17:20.100
 about him specifically about that whole world and about the

1:17:20.100 --> 1:17:22.660
 journey maybe of others that are going through the same

1:17:22.660 --> 1:17:26.740
 process because Ray is, at least from my perspective, I'm a

1:17:26.740 --> 1:17:33.620
 bit of an outsider. He's one of the most insightful and deep

1:17:33.620 --> 1:17:37.060
 thinkers about investment, about finance, about economics

1:17:37.060 --> 1:17:41.620
 in general. Actually, about life. So, it's interesting to

1:17:41.620 --> 1:17:44.260
 see him go on that journey. Do you have something to comment

1:17:44.260 --> 1:17:47.460
 about Ray or just those kinds of people in general? So, if we

1:17:47.460 --> 1:17:50.420
 look at what I'll just consider the legends of Wall Street in

1:17:50.420 --> 1:17:53.060
 general. Yeah. Right? There's no denying that they're

1:17:53.060 --> 1:17:56.180
 incredibly intelligent. There's no denying that actually,

1:17:56.180 --> 1:17:58.100
 especially in the hedge fund world, they're some of the most

1:17:58.100 --> 1:18:01.540
 open minded people in terms of they're willing to change their

1:18:01.540 --> 1:18:04.340
 mind when they get new information. There's no doubt

1:18:04.340 --> 1:18:07.540
 that they are historians in the sense of having studied

1:18:07.540 --> 1:18:11.700
 financial markets and cycles over time. And also, one of the

1:18:11.700 --> 1:18:14.340
 things that I really respect about all those guys is almost

1:18:14.340 --> 1:18:18.100
 all of them are willing to put ideas out via various writings

1:18:18.100 --> 1:18:21.140
 that they do and accept the public criticism, right?

1:18:21.140 --> 1:18:23.940
 Whether it's Howard Marks, Ray or others, they will put this

1:18:23.940 --> 1:18:28.180
 stuff out in public. And sure, there's a lot of people who are

1:18:28.180 --> 1:18:31.860
 supportive and kind of are part of a fan base, if you will. But

1:18:31.860 --> 1:18:33.540
 there's a lot of people who also think that sometimes they

1:18:33.540 --> 1:18:36.100
 say stupid things. And so, putting that out takes kind of

1:18:36.100 --> 1:18:40.020
 courage, right? I think Ray's actually the most fascinating

1:18:40.020 --> 1:18:42.900
 though out of all of these kind of legends of Wall Street in

1:18:42.900 --> 1:18:46.740
 that he understands debt cycles. He understands

1:18:46.740 --> 1:18:51.620
 currencies. He, for a while now, has been all over and

1:18:51.620 --> 1:18:55.300
 famously said, you know, cash is trash, investible assets,

1:18:55.300 --> 1:18:58.340
 right? He kind of like just knew all of it. And for a long

1:18:58.340 --> 1:19:00.500
 time, Bitcoiners have said, Ray, you understand the Bitcoin

1:19:00.500 --> 1:19:02.740
 argument, you're just missing the last part, which is Bitcoin

1:19:02.740 --> 1:19:05.940
 is the solution, right? And so, he was gold and some other

1:19:05.940 --> 1:19:10.340
 ideas. But I think that he's a perfect example of when you are

1:19:10.340 --> 1:19:14.900
 part of the establishment, people view you in a very

1:19:14.900 --> 1:19:18.900
 static way as the leader of a part of establishment. But

1:19:18.900 --> 1:19:22.340
 whether it's Bill Gates, Ray Dalio, or somebody else, each

1:19:22.340 --> 1:19:24.980
 one of these people were innovators and challengers to a

1:19:24.980 --> 1:19:27.700
 system. They were upstarts at one point. And so, it's kind of

1:19:27.700 --> 1:19:29.780
 this idea that like if you live long enough, you eventually

1:19:29.780 --> 1:19:33.300
 become the man, right? And so, you know, Gates is a good

1:19:33.300 --> 1:19:36.660
 example, right? Warren Buffett is a good example. Ray Dalio is

1:19:36.660 --> 1:19:39.780
 a good example, etc. And so, you have to give credit, I think,

1:19:39.780 --> 1:19:43.700
 to Dalio in the sense of he kept an open mind about all of

1:19:43.700 --> 1:19:48.100
 this and more so than many of his peers has continued to do

1:19:48.100 --> 1:19:51.460
 the work and come around to this idea. And now, I don't

1:19:51.460 --> 1:19:53.460
 want to know if I wanted to say that he's a Bitcoin

1:19:53.460 --> 1:19:58.100
 proponent as much as he believes it is one of a portion

1:19:58.100 --> 1:20:01.940
 of assets that can be a solution. And so, to me, when

1:20:01.940 --> 1:20:04.660
 you start to convince those types of people, when it's

1:20:04.660 --> 1:20:07.620
 Paul Tudor Jones, a Stanley Druckenmiller, Ray Dalio,

1:20:08.180 --> 1:20:11.060
 Howard Marks now even writing about it saying, hey, I was

1:20:11.060 --> 1:20:14.420
 anti Bitcoin and put a ton of intellectual rigor into it.

1:20:14.420 --> 1:20:17.460
 But thank God my son bought a bunch for our family, right?

1:20:17.460 --> 1:20:21.780
 And kind of we've had exposure to it. I think what it does is

1:20:21.780 --> 1:20:24.020
 more than anything, it's not going to convince somebody to

1:20:24.020 --> 1:20:29.620
 go and take it seriously or go ahead and make an allocation.

1:20:29.620 --> 1:20:33.540
 It reduces career risk. And so, if all of a sudden when Paul

1:20:33.540 --> 1:20:35.380
 Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller come out and

1:20:35.380 --> 1:20:38.820
 say, hey, I own Bitcoin and here's why, every other

1:20:38.820 --> 1:20:41.140
 investor on Wall Street now can say to an investment

1:20:41.140 --> 1:20:44.260
 committee, well, it's good enough for Paul Tudor Jones,

1:20:44.260 --> 1:20:46.740
 it's good enough for Stanley Druckenmiller. And so, I think

1:20:46.740 --> 1:20:49.620
 that it's very interesting because Ray doesn't just

1:20:49.620 --> 1:20:53.700
 represent Wall Street. I think Ray in some weird way

1:20:53.700 --> 1:20:57.700
 represents this like macro economic investor. And so,

1:20:57.700 --> 1:21:00.180
 some of those are in hedge funds and some of those people

1:21:00.180 --> 1:21:02.740
 would be like CIOs at organizations. Some of them

1:21:02.740 --> 1:21:05.060
 would be at corporations and some of them are just kind of

1:21:05.060 --> 1:21:09.620
 retail investors. And so, you can see this kind of inflection

1:21:09.620 --> 1:21:12.980
 point throughout the adoption of Bitcoin, right? There was

1:21:12.980 --> 1:21:15.620
 infrastructure that got built. Okay, that kind of led to more

1:21:15.620 --> 1:21:18.980
 adoption. There was certain individuals, right? Usually

1:21:18.980 --> 1:21:22.740
 they were kind of technology oriented, entrepreneurial

1:21:22.740 --> 1:21:25.220
 billionaires. They would buy it and come out and say it. Okay,

1:21:25.220 --> 1:21:28.820
 that led to inflection points. You started to have some of

1:21:28.820 --> 1:21:32.500
 these kind of Wall Street legends come out, sort of

1:21:32.500 --> 1:21:35.380
 financial institutions started. And now, you're seeing

1:21:35.380 --> 1:21:38.100
 corporations start to do it, right? Eventually, there's

1:21:38.100 --> 1:21:40.420
 going to be a central bank that does it. And so, you kind of

1:21:40.420 --> 1:21:43.140
 walk through that line and what you understand is like, it's

1:21:43.140 --> 1:21:46.900
 the same thing every time. It's just somebody new, right? That

1:21:46.900 --> 1:21:50.980
 path, right? That Bitcoiners journey, if you will. And I

1:21:50.980 --> 1:21:55.460
 think that that is almost the beauty of it is if you

1:21:55.460 --> 1:21:58.340
 short circuit the journey, it's almost like somebody doesn't

1:21:58.340 --> 1:22:01.700
 appreciate it, right? If you take, let's say, somebody who's

1:22:01.700 --> 1:22:03.700
 a young kid and you just give them a bunch of money and they

1:22:03.700 --> 1:22:05.940
 didn't have to work hard for it. They don't really

1:22:05.940 --> 1:22:09.940
 appreciate it. Well, and Ray actually has a book

1:22:09.940 --> 1:22:12.900
 principles, right? And he talks about the hero's journey. So,

1:22:12.900 --> 1:22:16.740
 he's like living it in some sense in terms of, you know,

1:22:16.740 --> 1:22:20.420
 thinking about digital currency in general, like digital

1:22:20.420 --> 1:22:26.660
 finance. It's one of the big transitions, transformations of

1:22:26.660 --> 1:22:31.060
 our world in some sense. It's not just about money. Or you

1:22:31.060 --> 1:22:33.780
 could argue that money is everything. I mean, it's like

1:22:33.780 --> 1:22:37.380
 money isn't just the narrow definition of money. Money is

1:22:37.380 --> 1:22:40.180
 really everything. And so, where you could argue that sort

1:22:40.180 --> 1:22:44.900
 of cryptocurrency is like the base layer of this

1:22:44.900 --> 1:22:47.540
 transformation to the digital space and everything else would

1:22:47.540 --> 1:22:52.500
 just be built on top of it. I use a different word that I

1:22:52.500 --> 1:22:56.020
 think is kind of closer to your world, which is it's ultimately

1:22:56.020 --> 1:23:00.900
 automation. And what I mean by that is, you know, before 1970

1:23:00.900 --> 1:23:03.940
 or 1980, all the assets were analog. And so, when you have

1:23:03.940 --> 1:23:06.740
 analog assets, physical stock certificates, physical bonds,

1:23:06.740 --> 1:23:11.060
 right, physical deed to a home, you have to physically exchange

1:23:11.060 --> 1:23:16.180
 them. When we wanted to increase transactions and

1:23:16.180 --> 1:23:19.700
 increase kind of global finance and access, we took those

1:23:19.700 --> 1:23:22.980
 physical assets and we created electronic QCIP assets. So, now

1:23:22.980 --> 1:23:26.740
 we have in centralized databases kind of a file, represents the

1:23:26.740 --> 1:23:29.700
 asset that's sitting somewhere in custody. And you and I can

1:23:29.700 --> 1:23:32.020
 transact them a little bit easier, but still centralized.

1:23:32.020 --> 1:23:34.820
 There's still some bureaucracy and, you know, maybe it takes

1:23:34.820 --> 1:23:37.620
 two days to transact rather than actually mailing it across

1:23:37.620 --> 1:23:42.500
 the world. Now, what we're seeing is a transition from

1:23:42.500 --> 1:23:45.780
 those electronic QCIPs to these digital assets. And so, if you

1:23:45.780 --> 1:23:49.620
 look at, again, just let's say money or currency, every

1:23:49.620 --> 1:23:51.620
 currency in the world is going to be digital. You're going to

1:23:51.620 --> 1:23:55.300
 have a digital dollar, a digital euro, yen, RMB. You're

1:23:55.300 --> 1:23:59.460
 going to have decentralized kind of open source money like

1:23:59.460 --> 1:24:02.660
 Bitcoin. You're also going to have private currencies like

1:24:02.660 --> 1:24:05.860
 Facebook's attempt at DiEM and there will be others that will

1:24:05.860 --> 1:24:09.460
 try to do this. And so, when you get everything digital, right,

1:24:09.460 --> 1:24:11.060
 and I think that's the kind of the first step that everyone

1:24:11.060 --> 1:24:13.940
 focuses on, the competition at the technology layer

1:24:13.940 --> 1:24:16.740
 essentially goes away. You get some level of feature parity

1:24:16.740 --> 1:24:18.500
 and sure, there's bells and whistles on each kind of

1:24:18.500 --> 1:24:21.140
 implementation of a digital currency, but at the end of the

1:24:21.140 --> 1:24:23.620
 day, the technology is relatively the same. And

1:24:23.620 --> 1:24:26.340
 ultimately, what it will do is it will facilitate the adoption

1:24:26.340 --> 1:24:29.140
 of digital wallets. So, you have to have a digital wallet

1:24:29.140 --> 1:24:31.380
 regardless of what digital currency you have. Same with me,

1:24:31.380 --> 1:24:34.340
 same with everybody else in the world. But what it does do is

1:24:34.340 --> 1:24:37.540
 when you kind of push away and reduce the friction of

1:24:37.540 --> 1:24:41.460
 competition at the technology layer, it moves the competition

1:24:41.460 --> 1:24:44.900
 to the monetary policy layer. And so, when you get to that

1:24:44.900 --> 1:24:47.220
 layer, now it becomes interesting because all of the

1:24:47.220 --> 1:24:50.500
 currencies are the same except for this one right now and maybe

1:24:50.500 --> 1:24:53.380
 there will be others in the future. But for sure, Bitcoin

1:24:53.380 --> 1:24:55.780
 today and people may try to replicate in a private manner

1:24:55.780 --> 1:24:59.140
 or something, but Bitcoin is kind of the only finite scarce

1:24:59.140 --> 1:25:04.180
 digital somebody. And so, when you then have that pretty big

1:25:04.180 --> 1:25:06.820
 difference in that competition at the monetary policy layer,

1:25:06.820 --> 1:25:10.020
 it's actually not going to matter where you get paid.

1:25:10.020 --> 1:25:12.980
 Right? And what I mean by that is like you and I both live in

1:25:12.980 --> 1:25:18.100
 a single currency environment. I get paid in dollars. I

1:25:18.100 --> 1:25:21.060
 historically have saved in dollars. All of the assets in

1:25:21.060 --> 1:25:25.460
 my life are denominated in dollars and I owe my debts in

1:25:25.460 --> 1:25:29.460
 dollars, whether it's taxes or in the private market. And I

1:25:29.460 --> 1:25:31.300
 don't have to worry about foreign currencies. I don't

1:25:31.300 --> 1:25:33.460
 exchange anything. The only time I would ever think about

1:25:33.460 --> 1:25:35.540
 another currency is if I'm going to another country in

1:25:35.540 --> 1:25:38.740
 their single currency environment. And in order to

1:25:39.460 --> 1:25:43.220
 change or exchange my currency, I go to the bank or I go get

1:25:43.220 --> 1:25:46.020
 ripped off at the airport. Right? Those are my two options.

1:25:46.020 --> 1:25:49.380
 So, it's high friction to change between currencies. When

1:25:49.380 --> 1:25:54.580
 the competition of technology is kind of innovated away, now

1:25:54.580 --> 1:25:57.140
 I can get paid in dollars, these digital dollars, and with

1:25:57.140 --> 1:25:59.220
 a click of a button, switch into any other currency in the

1:25:59.220 --> 1:26:03.220
 world. And so, what ultimately happens is value and liquidity

1:26:03.220 --> 1:26:07.460
 is going to coalesce around the best monetary policy. And so,

1:26:07.460 --> 1:26:09.220
 you get in this very weird world where even if the United

1:26:09.220 --> 1:26:11.060
 States says, hey, you're going to get paid in dollars, you have

1:26:11.060 --> 1:26:13.380
 to pay your taxes in dollars. You're going to start to see

1:26:13.380 --> 1:26:15.860
 people operate in a multi currency environment where they

1:26:15.860 --> 1:26:17.860
 say, okay, I got paid in my digital dollar, click a button,

1:26:17.860 --> 1:26:21.380
 I save in Bitcoin. It stays there or grows my purchasing

1:26:21.380 --> 1:26:23.620
 power. Oh, I need to pay my taxes. Let me switch back into

1:26:23.620 --> 1:26:26.820
 dollars with click of a button and pay. When you go to a

1:26:26.820 --> 1:26:30.580
 multi currency world, it's not just about currency. It's now

1:26:30.580 --> 1:26:34.660
 multi asset world. Because not only is the currency

1:26:34.660 --> 1:26:38.340
 digitized, but that same technology is used to digitize

1:26:38.340 --> 1:26:42.100
 stocks, bonds, and commodities as well. And so, today we live

1:26:42.100 --> 1:26:44.580
 in a very fragmented financial world where basically I have a

1:26:44.580 --> 1:26:46.980
 brokerage account, I have a bank account, I may have an

1:26:46.980 --> 1:26:50.820
 alternative asset account, etc. When I can put all those assets

1:26:50.820 --> 1:26:55.140
 in a single digital wallet, and I can then go from asset to

1:26:55.140 --> 1:26:58.180
 asset without having to go back to a single unit of account.

1:26:58.180 --> 1:27:01.860
 Like frictionless going from asset to asset. Yeah. So now

1:27:01.860 --> 1:27:03.940
 what you end up doing is you start to open up the

1:27:03.940 --> 1:27:07.220
 possibility for machine to machine transactions. Yeah. So

1:27:07.220 --> 1:27:10.660
 today, if you and I write software code for two machines

1:27:10.660 --> 1:27:13.940
 to transact with each other, they can't transact physical

1:27:13.940 --> 1:27:16.740
 currency. And in many cases, they can't actually transact

1:27:16.740 --> 1:27:19.700
 the electronic QCIP currencies or assets either because

1:27:19.700 --> 1:27:21.620
 there's too long of a settlement time. So you can't

1:27:21.620 --> 1:27:24.500
 get true automation, right? So the whole idea of the car's

1:27:24.500 --> 1:27:26.740
 going to drive over a strip in the road and it's going to

1:27:26.740 --> 1:27:29.620
 pay the toll, right? Well, that can't happen right now

1:27:29.620 --> 1:27:31.220
 because literally the transaction won't go through,

1:27:31.780 --> 1:27:35.380
 right? And so I always joke that in an automated world,

1:27:35.380 --> 1:27:38.260
 it's like a CD ROM, but we're trying to take cassette tape

1:27:38.260 --> 1:27:40.900
 player assets and put it in the CD ROM. It's just incompatible

1:27:40.900 --> 1:27:44.660
 technology. Reference is nobody understands at this point.

1:27:44.660 --> 1:27:46.900
 By the way, you need to update your reference. I probably

1:27:46.900 --> 1:27:48.900
 do. It's like taking a CD ROM and trying to put an MP3

1:27:48.900 --> 1:27:52.740
 player into a streaming. But I think that the reason why

1:27:52.740 --> 1:27:54.900
 that becomes really interesting is when you start to create

1:27:54.900 --> 1:27:57.860
 these digital assets, now you open up the world of

1:27:57.860 --> 1:27:59.940
 possibilities. So when new technology is created, you can

1:27:59.940 --> 1:28:02.420
 do two things. You can either create new things the world's

1:28:02.420 --> 1:28:04.980
 never seen before, or you can use it to improve the old

1:28:04.980 --> 1:28:08.180
 world. Most people, because it's the easiest thing to

1:28:08.180 --> 1:28:11.620
 think about, want to improve the old world. So an equivalent

1:28:11.620 --> 1:28:14.820
 of this would be when the internet came along, a media

1:28:14.820 --> 1:28:17.300
 company that had newspapers would say, hey, we should take

1:28:17.300 --> 1:28:20.100
 a PDF of the newspaper and we should put it on a website. And

1:28:20.100 --> 1:28:21.860
 now anyone in the world can go to this website and they can

1:28:21.860 --> 1:28:26.180
 read the newspaper today. That was valuable, but it missed out

1:28:26.180 --> 1:28:29.140
 on the ability to change headlines, to test, to put

1:28:29.140 --> 1:28:32.740
 multimedia, to distribute it differently, to do all kinds of

1:28:32.740 --> 1:28:35.300
 things that today we understand the internet really empowered.

1:28:35.860 --> 1:28:38.180
 And so what I think we're about to watch happen is we're going

1:28:38.180 --> 1:28:40.660
 to digitize the assets. We're going to put them all into

1:28:40.660 --> 1:28:43.700
 these digital wallets. You're going to get automated

1:28:43.700 --> 1:28:46.420
 technologies where machines can now transact with each other.

1:28:46.420 --> 1:28:50.020
 And we're going to do simple things like why do we pay

1:28:50.020 --> 1:28:53.780
 people once every two weeks? Why don't we just pay them at

1:28:53.780 --> 1:28:56.420
 the end of every day? Or why don't I literally stream

1:28:56.420 --> 1:28:59.300
 payments to you on an hour by hour basis based on the work

1:28:59.300 --> 1:29:03.460
 you do? It would solve incredible economic issues in

1:29:03.460 --> 1:29:05.620
 our country and in countries around the world. But

1:29:05.620 --> 1:29:08.180
 historically businesses can't do this because of the

1:29:08.180 --> 1:29:10.580
 technology problem. They can't keep track of it all. How do

1:29:10.580 --> 1:29:12.340
 they pay everyone every day? How do they pay everyone every

1:29:12.340 --> 1:29:13.780
 hour? You just can't do it.

1:29:13.780 --> 1:29:17.300
 Yeah, it's funny. The vision of the future you're painting,

1:29:18.180 --> 1:29:22.500
 it's kind of an exciting one. And it almost makes me sad

1:29:22.500 --> 1:29:24.980
 looking into the future when we'll look back at this time.

1:29:24.980 --> 1:29:30.180
 It's like how incredibly inefficient financial

1:29:30.180 --> 1:29:33.940
 transactions were. Like the transaction of value of any

1:29:33.940 --> 1:29:38.260
 kind. Like how to pay each other. Like there has to be

1:29:38.260 --> 1:29:43.300
 processes. There's like payroll and all this kind of just the

1:29:43.300 --> 1:29:47.620
 entirety of the transactions is just like painful. Almost

1:29:47.620 --> 1:29:51.220
 all transactions are painful. And the companies that

1:29:51.220 --> 1:29:55.540
 innovate to make the transactions a little bit more

1:29:55.540 --> 1:29:58.660
 frictionless like Amazon with the one click purchase button

1:29:58.660 --> 1:30:02.500
 like went out huge. But even that's really painful. It's

1:30:02.500 --> 1:30:04.660
 actually really interesting especially when you start to

1:30:04.660 --> 1:30:07.540
 move that into the space of data. There's a lot of people

1:30:07.540 --> 1:30:11.380
 thinking about privacy and data and like can we put, can

1:30:11.380 --> 1:30:17.460
 we like convert data into like money so that you can pay for

1:30:17.460 --> 1:30:19.780
 how much you reveal to the companies about your own

1:30:19.780 --> 1:30:24.340
 private data that can then be used to assign value to you so

1:30:24.340 --> 1:30:27.140
 you can use the service for free if you hand over the data

1:30:27.140 --> 1:30:30.100
 but there's like explicit transaction going on. So you

1:30:30.100 --> 1:30:34.660
 can empower all those kinds of things that will just like

1:30:34.660 --> 1:30:37.220
 fundamentally change our world. That's really, really,

1:30:37.220 --> 1:30:37.860
 really exciting.

1:30:37.860 --> 1:30:41.300
 One of the most interesting things to me is I invested in

1:30:41.300 --> 1:30:43.460
 a company called Bridget and what they told me was they said

1:30:43.460 --> 1:30:49.140
 $8 billion was paid to the top four banks last year on

1:30:49.140 --> 1:30:52.980
 overdraft fees. So literally they took $8 billion from

1:30:52.980 --> 1:30:55.940
 people who didn't have money in their bank account, right?

1:30:55.940 --> 1:30:58.420
 And so when you dig into why is that a lot of times it's not

1:30:58.420 --> 1:31:01.060
 that the people don't have the money. It's actually a

1:31:01.060 --> 1:31:04.500
 mismatch of the payments. So what ends up happening is you

1:31:04.500 --> 1:31:06.820
 get paid on the 1st and the 15th but on the 12th your

1:31:06.820 --> 1:31:10.500
 Netflix bill hits, on the 13th you went grocery shopping, and

1:31:10.500 --> 1:31:13.460
 on the 14th your car payments hit, you overdraft, and then

1:31:13.460 --> 1:31:15.140
 on the 15th you actually get the check and then you're able

1:31:15.140 --> 1:31:18.020
 to pay not only the overdraft but for the expenses that you

1:31:18.020 --> 1:31:21.060
 have. And so something as simple as just getting paid at

1:31:21.060 --> 1:31:24.420
 the end of every day immediately would eliminate

1:31:24.420 --> 1:31:27.700
 some big percentage of those $8 billion of value that flows

1:31:27.700 --> 1:31:30.260
 to large institutions on overdraft fees.

1:31:30.260 --> 1:31:34.100
 Yeah and also I mean this whole process with overdraft fees

1:31:34.100 --> 1:31:37.060
 and just many of the financial transactions we have to live

1:31:37.060 --> 1:31:42.740
 through today forces many of us to be like accountants, like

1:31:42.740 --> 1:31:46.820
 to understand the different mechanism of financial like

1:31:46.820 --> 1:31:50.100
 the movement of money as opposed to you which is what we

1:31:50.100 --> 1:31:53.860
 want to do as human beings operating in high layers of

1:31:53.860 --> 1:31:58.340
 like providing services for others, of like following your

1:31:58.340 --> 1:32:01.860
 passions and like working for others, like doing cool shit

1:32:01.860 --> 1:32:07.060
 or you know basically providing value, exchanging value

1:32:07.060 --> 1:32:09.700
 in the world and not thinking about the money. The money

1:32:09.700 --> 1:32:12.420
 takes care of itself and then you see the results of it.

1:32:12.420 --> 1:32:19.460
 So you're able to think in terms of money but not have to

1:32:19.460 --> 1:32:22.180
 know how like the accounting works.

1:32:22.980 --> 1:32:26.340
 Automation simply frees humans up to do more creative

1:32:26.340 --> 1:32:26.740
 work.

1:32:26.740 --> 1:32:27.300
 Yeah.

1:32:27.300 --> 1:32:27.460
 Right?

1:32:27.460 --> 1:32:28.340
 Yeah.

1:32:28.340 --> 1:32:29.380
 Like that's it.

1:32:29.380 --> 1:32:29.700
 Yeah.

1:32:29.700 --> 1:32:30.340
 And what we

1:32:30.340 --> 1:32:34.180
 Which is why you use the term automation which I think is

1:32:34.180 --> 1:32:36.740
 kind of brilliant reframing of all of this.

1:32:36.740 --> 1:32:40.100
 Yeah because ultimately digital technologies are merely

1:32:40.100 --> 1:32:44.980
 the conduit to ushers into that world and I think the most

1:32:44.980 --> 1:32:50.020
 fascinating part of this entire industry is people who are

1:32:50.020 --> 1:32:52.980
 trying to figure out now that we're going to have these

1:32:52.980 --> 1:32:56.900
 digital technologies how do we usher in that automated world

1:32:56.900 --> 1:33:00.020
 faster and so there's people who are building all kinds of

1:33:00.020 --> 1:33:04.420
 incredible things right there's literally some technologies

1:33:04.420 --> 1:33:09.300
 where you can stream for paying for consumption of content.

1:33:09.300 --> 1:33:09.940
 Yeah.

1:33:09.940 --> 1:33:13.060
 Right there's I saw somebody recently who they basically

1:33:13.060 --> 1:33:16.660
 said hey I have created something but it's not going to

1:33:16.660 --> 1:33:20.580
 be released until everyone and almost like a GoFundMe type

1:33:20.580 --> 1:33:23.540
 situation pays for it in combination then it gets

1:33:23.540 --> 1:33:26.580
 unlocked and so when you start to think about this it's not

1:33:26.580 --> 1:33:28.820
 only innovation on the technology front it's innovation

1:33:28.820 --> 1:33:33.300
 around the way that we form capital it's the way that we

1:33:34.180 --> 1:33:36.820
 organize resources it's the way that we build companies it's

1:33:36.820 --> 1:33:39.540
 the business models right it's the application of those

1:33:39.540 --> 1:33:43.860
 technologies all that stuff starts to change and go back to

1:33:43.860 --> 1:33:49.540
 a 2007 that's when the iPhone came out Uber wasn't possible

1:33:49.540 --> 1:33:51.620
 right I'm just going to lie like all these companies that

1:33:51.620 --> 1:33:54.980
 weren't possible before when the digital technologies are

1:33:54.980 --> 1:33:58.500
 kind of adopted on a global scale I think that we all myself

1:33:58.500 --> 1:34:02.500
 included drastically underestimate how fast and how

1:34:02.500 --> 1:34:06.100
 big innovation can be because it's just hard right like like

1:34:06.100 --> 1:34:08.500
 we like to think linearly and that's not how the world works.

1:34:08.500 --> 1:34:14.180
 Yeah I do find it kind of interesting it is NFT based but

1:34:14.180 --> 1:34:20.180
 I don't think it has to be this this idea of I think big clout

1:34:20.180 --> 1:34:23.860
 it's called or whatever the idea of sort of investing in

1:34:23.860 --> 1:34:26.660
 individuals it makes me immediately think about

1:34:26.660 --> 1:34:32.100
 investing in ideas so even just the words you speak having

1:34:32.100 --> 1:34:38.420
 value and sort of if you have a frictionless like automated

1:34:39.140 --> 1:34:42.500
 financial system then you could do a bunch of interesting

1:34:42.500 --> 1:34:46.580
 things about what it means to add value to the world I mean

1:34:47.860 --> 1:34:50.420
 I don't know if big cloud is currently an efficient

1:34:50.420 --> 1:34:58.180
 representation of that but I am truly happy that however that

1:34:58.180 --> 1:35:03.060
 thing works I'm just one notch above Vladimir Putin which is

1:35:03.060 --> 1:35:06.180
 one of the that's like one of the bucket list items for me to

1:35:06.180 --> 1:35:09.460
 to have a list where I'm one notch above Putin well what I

1:35:09.460 --> 1:35:12.740
 think you're talking about here is important because there's

1:35:12.740 --> 1:35:16.660
 historical examples you could invest in a patent in some

1:35:16.660 --> 1:35:20.340
 situations you could invest in an organization that has an

1:35:20.340 --> 1:35:23.940
 idea right so these are super inefficient given kind of the

1:35:23.940 --> 1:35:26.020
 vision that you're painting in terms of like investing directly

1:35:26.020 --> 1:35:29.380
 in an idea in a super efficient automated fashion yeah but

1:35:29.380 --> 1:35:32.980
 that's how the technology evolution works right is it's

1:35:32.980 --> 1:35:35.540
 really hard to do at first and then slowly kind of becomes

1:35:35.540 --> 1:35:39.060
 easier and easier as technology is more prevalent the other

1:35:39.060 --> 1:35:40.580
 thing that I think is interesting is this whole idea

1:35:40.580 --> 1:35:43.860
 of investing in people if you really think about the

1:35:43.860 --> 1:35:48.180
 origination of that is I would hire somebody right I pay you

1:35:48.180 --> 1:35:50.660
 money and then you're going to create production but I take

1:35:50.660 --> 1:35:54.820
 the lion's share and you don't now there's things like these

1:35:54.820 --> 1:35:57.940
 ISAs these income sharing agreements where basically I

1:35:57.940 --> 1:36:01.620
 will educate you on something train you on something I'll put

1:36:01.620 --> 1:36:05.140
 up capital right and then over time you'll pay me back plus

1:36:05.140 --> 1:36:09.300
 profits as some version eventually I don't know what it

1:36:09.300 --> 1:36:14.420
 looks like but being able to get upside in somebody's success

1:36:14.420 --> 1:36:18.020
 for having risk capital early on doesn't seem that far off

1:36:18.020 --> 1:36:20.740
 see it in professional sports you see it in you know a lot of

1:36:20.740 --> 1:36:24.660
 these things and so I just think that a lot of the focus

1:36:24.660 --> 1:36:30.020
 right now is on the technology but ultimately these are ideas

1:36:30.020 --> 1:36:33.540
 that are very old and have had lots of success and traction

1:36:33.540 --> 1:36:36.180
 and we're just merely standing in the way of the evolution of

1:36:36.180 --> 1:36:40.820
 these ideas with new technology and so it's easy to get caught

1:36:40.820 --> 1:36:43.380
 up in the technology but when you really zoom out and look at

1:36:43.380 --> 1:36:46.180
 it from the ideological standpoint and kind of the

1:36:46.180 --> 1:36:49.220
 progress of humanity it's a foregone conclusion this stuff's

1:36:49.220 --> 1:36:52.500
 going to happen it's just how I think the world is waiting and

1:36:52.500 --> 1:36:56.660
 some of us are trying to create that future world which is like

1:36:56.660 --> 1:36:59.140
 what are the applications of this technology that will

1:36:59.140 --> 1:37:03.140
 transform the world and then you know I hate the term but

1:37:03.140 --> 1:37:08.100
 killer apps like cool ideas that are implemented effectively at

1:37:08.100 --> 1:37:11.540
 scale that transform the world and there's been a there's been

1:37:11.540 --> 1:37:15.300
 a lot of different ideas popping up like the there's a

1:37:15.300 --> 1:37:17.940
 lot of ideas about social networks that are built on top

1:37:17.940 --> 1:37:21.140
 of the technology and all that kind of stuff so but let me

1:37:21.140 --> 1:37:25.620
 actually drag this back down to something basic if a person

1:37:25.620 --> 1:37:32.500
 wanted to buy Bitcoin store Bitcoin how do they actually do

1:37:32.500 --> 1:37:36.900
 it yeah so there's a couple of different ways to kind of

1:37:36.900 --> 1:37:40.820
 acquire Bitcoin and in every way you've got to exchange

1:37:40.820 --> 1:37:44.420
 some form of value for Bitcoin right which is part of why it

1:37:44.420 --> 1:37:49.140
 has values because you're giving up value so in one way is

1:37:49.140 --> 1:37:54.420
 to exchange energy and computational power for Bitcoin

1:37:54.420 --> 1:37:57.780
 so you can mine it you can literally take computer power

1:37:57.780 --> 1:38:01.860
 that you have you can rent it to the network and run that

1:38:01.860 --> 1:38:05.620
 software and then it will pay you a portion of the kind of

1:38:05.620 --> 1:38:09.220
 daily revenue off that system and you can acquire Bitcoin in

1:38:09.220 --> 1:38:13.060
 exchange for your power and your computational kind of

1:38:13.060 --> 1:38:15.380
 contribution and that's the fundamental principle behind

1:38:15.380 --> 1:38:20.100
 Bitcoin is the proof of work so I got a hundred bucks like I

1:38:20.100 --> 1:38:25.540
 use cash app the you know they there's Coinbase there's all

1:38:25.540 --> 1:38:32.500
 these exchanges like how do I convert my $100 to Bitcoin is

1:38:32.500 --> 1:38:36.340
 there something disclaimer this is not financial advice and

1:38:36.340 --> 1:38:40.180
 this is just us talking and just your opinions this do not

1:38:40.180 --> 1:38:46.820
 use this to invest or take as financial expertise that said

1:38:46.820 --> 1:38:50.500
 like is there something you recommend that's an easy entry

1:38:50.500 --> 1:38:54.100
 point for somebody that's like hmm I wonder if I can convert

1:38:54.100 --> 1:38:57.620
 this hundred dollars into whatever amount of Bitcoin what

1:38:57.620 --> 1:39:00.180
 do you recommend what are the options so there's a lot of

1:39:00.180 --> 1:39:03.620
 options I'm heavily biased I went out and I scoured the

1:39:03.620 --> 1:39:05.700
 market looked at all of them I've invested a lot of money in

1:39:05.700 --> 1:39:08.820
 a company called BlockFi that basically basically has

1:39:08.820 --> 1:39:11.540
 financial products for crypto investors so you can go you can

1:39:11.540 --> 1:39:14.820
 take dollars or other currency you have you can convert it

1:39:14.820 --> 1:39:18.420
 through an exchange you can leave it on these interest

1:39:18.420 --> 1:39:20.180
 bearing accounts you can earn interest just like you would

1:39:20.180 --> 1:39:22.980
 earn in a traditional account but higher levels of interest

1:39:22.980 --> 1:39:26.580
 because it's this new thing or you can withdraw it and you can

1:39:26.580 --> 1:39:29.620
 put it into cold storage on a hardware device you can leave

1:39:29.620 --> 1:39:31.540
 it in a software wallet there's kind of all these storage

1:39:31.540 --> 1:39:34.660
 options so BlockFi is you know kind of the one that I'm biased

1:39:34.660 --> 1:39:40.740
 towards because I'm sorry to interrupt so BlockFi is Bitcoin

1:39:40.740 --> 1:39:43.140
 only or is it an exchange with other crypto it's got a bunch

1:39:43.140 --> 1:39:46.180
 of different ones yeah they basically are agnostic to what

1:39:46.180 --> 1:39:50.340
 it is but they provide kind of financial you know products to

1:39:50.340 --> 1:39:53.620
 crypto investors okay so you mentioned a few interesting

1:39:53.620 --> 1:39:57.220
 ideas that'd be nice for people who would not be familiar with

1:39:57.220 --> 1:40:02.100
 it cold storage hot storage what does that mean so like I go to

1:40:02.100 --> 1:40:06.820
 a website and I convert dollars to Bitcoin that's a kind of

1:40:06.820 --> 1:40:12.100
 storage that's like online banking right what else is

1:40:12.100 --> 1:40:14.740
 there so there's a couple of different things that you can

1:40:14.740 --> 1:40:17.220
 do right and let's use the legacy system as kind of an

1:40:17.220 --> 1:40:23.140
 example so if I want to get currency and I put in my bank

1:40:23.140 --> 1:40:27.300
 account it sits there I have to trust that the bank doesn't go

1:40:27.300 --> 1:40:30.820
 under nobody steals it all this kind of stuff there's insurance

1:40:30.820 --> 1:40:33.140
 for it right there's all these kind of benefits in the legacy

1:40:33.140 --> 1:40:35.620
 system to make sure that as long as I don't have you know

1:40:35.620 --> 1:40:37.300
 millions and millions of dollars there I'm going to be

1:40:37.300 --> 1:40:40.260
 protected pretty much if anything happens through FDIC

1:40:40.260 --> 1:40:44.980
 insurance if I want to do that I'm taking that counterparty

1:40:44.980 --> 1:40:47.460
 risk though so it's mitigated but there's still counterparty

1:40:47.460 --> 1:40:50.260
 risk I'm counting on that bank but it is easier to move it

1:40:50.260 --> 1:40:52.180
 around right if all of a sudden you call me up and say hey send

1:40:52.180 --> 1:40:54.580
 me some money I can press a couple buttons on my computer

1:40:54.580 --> 1:40:58.740
 and it'll send it to you if I want deeper level of security I

1:40:58.740 --> 1:41:02.180
 can go and I can get the physical dollars and I can go

1:41:02.180 --> 1:41:05.460
 and I can you know put under my mattress right and I can say

1:41:05.460 --> 1:41:07.860
 you know what it's not gonna be as easy to send it to you

1:41:07.860 --> 1:41:10.820
 immediately but if I really want to I can go underneath my

1:41:10.820 --> 1:41:13.380
 mattress pretty quickly I can grab it I can get it back to

1:41:13.380 --> 1:41:16.420
 the bank and then I can send you the money the third thing I

1:41:16.420 --> 1:41:18.500
 could do is I could basically take those physical dollars out

1:41:18.500 --> 1:41:21.700
 of the bank and I could go and I could go put it literally you

1:41:21.700 --> 1:41:24.420
 know in a vault somewhere that I don't have control over that's

1:41:24.420 --> 1:41:27.780
 behind 10 passwords and biometric scanning and like it's

1:41:27.780 --> 1:41:30.740
 really difficult to even get to it right so if you can almost

1:41:30.740 --> 1:41:33.540
 look at it it's like there's three stages of security that

1:41:33.540 --> 1:41:35.540
 you could have in the traditional world the same thing

1:41:35.540 --> 1:41:38.500
 is true in Bitcoin so you could buy Bitcoin on any exchange you

1:41:38.500 --> 1:41:40.420
 can do it on BlockFi but you also can do it on places like

1:41:40.420 --> 1:41:46.100
 Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, etc. Also Cash App. Cash App. You can

1:41:46.100 --> 1:41:48.900
 do it on Cash App. I think I think they're still sponsoring

1:41:48.900 --> 1:41:54.020
 this podcast. I'm not biased at all. So once you get Bitcoin

1:41:54.020 --> 1:41:58.820
 on any of these venues you can leave it there on that venue.

1:41:58.820 --> 1:42:02.580
 Now the trade off is you're taking counterparty risk so

1:42:02.580 --> 1:42:04.980
 somebody else is responsible for the security and the

1:42:04.980 --> 1:42:09.140
 protection of it in many cases big well known companies who

1:42:09.140 --> 1:42:11.380
 have billions of billions of dollars of assets they have

1:42:11.380 --> 1:42:13.540
 higher levels of security that's why they're well known

1:42:13.540 --> 1:42:15.300
 that's why people trust them whatever but you are taking

1:42:15.300 --> 1:42:19.460
 counterparty risk it is easier to quickly send to somebody so

1:42:19.460 --> 1:42:22.660
 that so the trade off of like ease of use but counterparty

1:42:22.660 --> 1:42:25.380
 risk is big and in the Bitcoin community specifically there's

1:42:25.380 --> 1:42:29.140
 a huge thing of they really really have a keep for not

1:42:29.140 --> 1:42:32.660
 leaving the Bitcoin there right for the obvious counterparty

1:42:32.660 --> 1:42:35.620
 the second thing you can do is you can basically get it off of

1:42:35.620 --> 1:42:38.660
 an exchange and you can put it in some level of kind of what

1:42:38.660 --> 1:42:41.220
 I'll call a second layer of storage that second layer

1:42:41.220 --> 1:42:43.700
 storage could be a hardware device that you can quickly

1:42:43.700 --> 1:42:45.540
 just you know grab off your desk and plug into your

1:42:45.540 --> 1:42:47.860
 computer and immediately use that's what they call like a

1:42:47.860 --> 1:42:51.460
 hardware wallet or you can have some sort of software wallet

1:42:51.460 --> 1:42:53.940
 right where it's not on an exchange but there is some

1:42:53.940 --> 1:42:57.060
 level of in between between the hardware wallet and the

1:42:57.060 --> 1:42:59.540
 exchange and the software wallet but the software wallet

1:42:59.540 --> 1:43:02.980
 is connected to the internet yeah and so if you kind of

1:43:02.980 --> 1:43:05.700
 think of it as like the exchange software wallet

1:43:05.700 --> 1:43:07.780
 hardware wallet and then there's something called deep

1:43:07.780 --> 1:43:11.060
 storage right or cold storage and this is you know

1:43:11.060 --> 1:43:15.700
 literally there was a company called Zappo that would put

1:43:15.700 --> 1:43:19.060
 things in deep cold storage and it was literally buried in

1:43:19.060 --> 1:43:22.660
 a mountain right so like the odds that somebody's

1:43:22.660 --> 1:43:24.900
 physically going to go there there's armed guards there's

1:43:24.900 --> 1:43:27.460
 you know kind of all this type of stuff but again you're

1:43:27.460 --> 1:43:29.620
 taking some level of counterparty risk because they

1:43:29.620 --> 1:43:33.780
 have your Bitcoin and so the saying or the phrase is not

1:43:33.780 --> 1:43:38.180
 your keys not your coins whereas my buddy Isaiah Jackson

1:43:38.180 --> 1:43:42.420
 came up with he said not your keys not your cheese right in

1:43:42.420 --> 1:43:46.420
 terms of sovereignty is important right and ultimately

1:43:46.420 --> 1:43:48.180
 this goes back to kind of the beginning of our conversation

1:43:48.180 --> 1:43:52.180
 around Bitcoin's ethos sovereignty right giving the

1:43:52.180 --> 1:43:55.300
 power back to people you don't have to rely on this

1:43:55.300 --> 1:43:58.020
 infrastructure in order to be able to participate in this

1:43:58.020 --> 1:44:01.540
 monetary kind of economy what you are now able to do is

1:44:01.540 --> 1:44:04.420
 you're able to use digital sound money you're able to

1:44:04.420 --> 1:44:07.620
 keep control of it you and you alone are responsible for it

1:44:07.620 --> 1:44:10.900
 so the idea of personal responsibility and then also

1:44:10.900 --> 1:44:13.540
 you and you alone make the decisions as to whether you

1:44:13.540 --> 1:44:16.900
 hold on to it or you use it without censorship right no

1:44:16.900 --> 1:44:19.060
 one can tell you what you can do with it or can't do with it

1:44:19.060 --> 1:44:24.580
 and so the purchase and the storage what I find is

1:44:24.580 --> 1:44:29.460
 depending on who you are there's varying degrees of kind

1:44:29.460 --> 1:44:32.660
 of concern or decisions that get made there and a lot of it

1:44:32.660 --> 1:44:35.300
 comes down to personal preference the Bitcoin

1:44:35.300 --> 1:44:38.740
 community though absolutely will over optimize for

1:44:38.740 --> 1:44:42.260
 sovereignty and kind of hardware or cold storage I

1:44:42.260 --> 1:44:45.220
 wonder if you can sort of comment on that because you

1:44:45.220 --> 1:44:52.100
 have both sort of cash app and the BlockFi and Coinbase like

1:44:52.100 --> 1:44:56.020
 you can store it that you can purchase and trade it there

1:44:56.020 --> 1:44:59.620
 and store it there and so on but ultimately they're saying

1:44:59.620 --> 1:45:02.340
 you wanna you know keep some of it there but you wanna move

1:45:02.340 --> 1:45:06.260
 it to the hardware wallet and the cold storage of the

1:45:06.260 --> 1:45:08.820
 hardware wallet is like you can disconnect this from the

1:45:08.820 --> 1:45:11.540
 computer because ultimately stuff that's connected to the

1:45:11.540 --> 1:45:16.180
 internet can be compromised can be controlled by governments

1:45:16.180 --> 1:45:19.860
 and other parties and so on what are your thoughts about

1:45:19.860 --> 1:45:24.340
 sort of practically speaking for maybe like a regular

1:45:24.340 --> 1:45:28.100
 citizen what's what should be the role of the hardware wallet

1:45:28.100 --> 1:45:31.060
 in their lives yeah so at the highest level I just think

1:45:31.060 --> 1:45:33.860
 that like learning about it is important right so even if you

1:45:33.860 --> 1:45:37.540
 only have five dollars equivalent of Bitcoin going and

1:45:37.540 --> 1:45:39.940
 understanding here's how it works here's why it's important

1:45:39.940 --> 1:45:42.900
 here's how I would actually withdraw from an exchange under

1:45:42.900 --> 1:45:45.700
 the hardware wall like that alone just as an intellectual

1:45:45.700 --> 1:45:47.860
 exercise is a worthwhile pursuit I think people should

1:45:47.860 --> 1:45:50.500
 go do that actually go through the process of the steps so

1:45:50.500 --> 1:45:53.460
 you feel like you can you can do it yeah yeah it's kind of

1:45:53.460 --> 1:45:55.620
 like if I said to you you know hey we're gonna go buy an

1:45:55.620 --> 1:45:57.940
 asset and you never went and you looked at it you never went

1:45:57.940 --> 1:46:01.060
 and you know made a decision like sure maybe I did it or I

1:46:01.060 --> 1:46:03.380
 didn't do it but like you didn't actually experience it

1:46:03.380 --> 1:46:05.540
 right and so I think that that's important part the

1:46:05.540 --> 1:46:09.780
 second thing is each person is different from a how they view

1:46:09.780 --> 1:46:12.020
 this asset so there are some people who are speculating

1:46:12.020 --> 1:46:14.260
 right there's three use cases for Bitcoin their store value

1:46:14.260 --> 1:46:16.900
 medium of exchange and speculation and the people who

1:46:16.900 --> 1:46:19.780
 are speculating they can't put it in deep cold storage because

1:46:19.780 --> 1:46:22.660
 they need to be able to trade it right so what ends up

1:46:22.660 --> 1:46:25.140
 happening is they fall in the bucket of like high risk high

1:46:25.140 --> 1:46:28.580
 reward they're trying to trade they're trying to do all these

1:46:28.580 --> 1:46:30.900
 things and sure maybe there are profits that they can generate

1:46:30.900 --> 1:46:33.620
 if they're good at it but also they're introducing a lot of

1:46:33.620 --> 1:46:36.260
 risk and so that person is very different than the person who

1:46:36.260 --> 1:46:38.740
 says hey you know I bought one Bitcoin and I'm gonna save it

1:46:38.740 --> 1:46:40.900
 for my child right and I'm gonna give it to them on their

1:46:40.900 --> 1:46:44.180
 18th birthday yeah and so when you start to look at this what

1:46:44.180 --> 1:46:48.340
 you end up saying is what are you actually purchasing this

1:46:48.340 --> 1:46:50.900
 for kind of like why are you doing it and then what's your

1:46:50.900 --> 1:46:55.060
 time horizon and what ends up happening is more and more

1:46:55.060 --> 1:46:57.540
 people in the Bitcoin community have longer time horizons one

1:46:57.540 --> 1:47:01.060
 of the advantages to this community right if you look at

1:47:01.060 --> 1:47:04.980
 the on chain metrics 60% of Bitcoin haven't moved from the

1:47:04.980 --> 1:47:08.340
 digital wallet in which they sit in the last 12 months so

1:47:08.340 --> 1:47:10.740
 even though it's appreciated hundreds of percent on the

1:47:10.740 --> 1:47:13.940
 upside there's been lots of volatility a 50% drop in a

1:47:13.940 --> 1:47:17.540
 single day in terms of US dollar price still doesn't move

1:47:17.540 --> 1:47:19.620
 and so these are the kind of long term holders right these

1:47:19.620 --> 1:47:22.980
 are the the iron fist or or as recently has become popular the

1:47:22.980 --> 1:47:27.780
 diamond hands right they just they're not going anywhere and

1:47:27.780 --> 1:47:32.180
 so I think that those people are much more likely to not have

1:47:32.180 --> 1:47:35.780
 their Bitcoin on exchanges or in software walls they've got it

1:47:35.780 --> 1:47:39.540
 in some sort of like highly secure environment and what and

1:47:39.540 --> 1:47:43.780
 one in which they have deep sovereignty or kind of prevalent

1:47:43.780 --> 1:47:46.980
 sovereignty and the reason for that is because they have that

1:47:46.980 --> 1:47:50.820
 long time horizon they don't want to be kind of convicted

1:47:50.820 --> 1:47:55.700
 around Bitcoin sound money macro environment all stuff and

1:47:55.700 --> 1:47:58.100
 then they make a mistake because they trusted you know

1:47:58.100 --> 1:48:01.940
 ABCD company and that counterparty risk ends up

1:48:01.940 --> 1:48:06.100
 actually being you know fatal or or detrimental so again this

1:48:06.100 --> 1:48:12.340
 is not financial advice disclaimer but let me ask so

1:48:12.340 --> 1:48:16.180
 in terms of investment advice on Bitcoin so you see Bitcoin

1:48:16.180 --> 1:48:19.700
 potentially not just the thing that you speculate over like

1:48:19.700 --> 1:48:22.580
 buy and sell buy and sell buy and sell but it's something

1:48:22.580 --> 1:48:26.500
 that you can just buy only and I believe I've heard that you

1:48:26.500 --> 1:48:31.220
 own quite a large percentage of of your wealth in in Bitcoin

1:48:31.220 --> 1:48:34.980
 and you're basically buying only and storing long term so

1:48:34.980 --> 1:48:38.180
 that's something that's a legitimate way to approach

1:48:38.180 --> 1:48:41.940
 Bitcoin in your recommendation go to other cultures so if we

1:48:41.940 --> 1:48:45.060
 remove ourselves from the Western world culture of

1:48:45.060 --> 1:48:48.020
 investing in gamification of financial markets and the

1:48:48.020 --> 1:48:51.540
 financialization of everything let's say we go to the culture

1:48:51.540 --> 1:48:55.860
 of India for hundreds if not thousands of years families

1:48:55.860 --> 1:49:00.420
 basically saved their wealth in gold and in jewelry and in

1:49:00.420 --> 1:49:04.820
 these hard assets with the expectation to pass it on to

1:49:04.820 --> 1:49:09.620
 the next generation and so it would be blasphemous to sell

1:49:09.620 --> 1:49:12.660
 the family's gold in that culture right you know your

1:49:12.660 --> 1:49:14.820
 great grandfather gave to your grandfather your grandfather

1:49:14.820 --> 1:49:17.700
 gave to your father your father gave it to you right and

1:49:17.700 --> 1:49:24.020
 so in that culture the long term kind of holding is the

1:49:24.020 --> 1:49:28.820
 default I think that what Bitcoin has presented again is

1:49:28.820 --> 1:49:32.900
 a digital application of the exact same thing which is that

1:49:32.900 --> 1:49:35.540
 while everything else in the world is being devalued that is

1:49:35.540 --> 1:49:40.500
 denominated in a currency that is being inflated away whether

1:49:40.500 --> 1:49:45.220
 it's quickly or not this finite supply this scarce asset ends

1:49:45.220 --> 1:49:49.460
 up accruing more and more value over time right and so I think

1:49:49.460 --> 1:49:53.940
 that for me personally I've got you know over 95% of my net

1:49:53.940 --> 1:49:59.540
 worth that's in this 90 over 95% of your net worth there's

1:49:59.540 --> 1:50:04.900
 two important caveats to this one is I didn't you know buy

1:50:04.900 --> 1:50:08.260
 some Bitcoin in 2011 or 12 right and then all of a sudden it

1:50:08.260 --> 1:50:11.620
 appreciated a bunch and it grew into that but from a cost

1:50:11.620 --> 1:50:14.580
 basis perspective you know put $100 and now it's a ton of

1:50:14.580 --> 1:50:21.140
 money instead what I did was I basically in 2018 saw Bitcoin

1:50:21.140 --> 1:50:23.140
 from a US dollar price standpoint was falling and

1:50:23.140 --> 1:50:26.020
 falling and falling and in December 2018 as I take about

1:50:26.020 --> 1:50:30.420
 50% of my net worth and convert it from dollar denominated

1:50:30.420 --> 1:50:32.660
 assets into Bitcoin so it's a very kind of intentional

1:50:32.660 --> 1:50:34.980
 decision with a very specific view on the world as to like

1:50:34.980 --> 1:50:38.820
 why I was doing it I then essentially just let it sit

1:50:38.820 --> 1:50:44.100
 there grow whatever until the spring of 2020 and when I saw

1:50:44.100 --> 1:50:47.620
 the government step in and start to say hey we're going to

1:50:47.620 --> 1:50:50.100
 really be aggressive in terms of interest rate manipulation

1:50:50.100 --> 1:50:52.820
 and quantitative easing I then decided to go ahead and take

1:50:52.820 --> 1:50:55.940
 basically the remainder and start to convert it as well so

1:50:55.940 --> 1:50:59.700
 became very aggressive in doing that and so the way that I look

1:50:59.700 --> 1:51:03.780
 at it is that's actually my savings right and so in some

1:51:03.780 --> 1:51:06.100
 weird way if I said to you know what's the dollar worth you'd

1:51:06.100 --> 1:51:09.860
 say well a one dollar bill is worth one dollar right Bitcoin

1:51:09.860 --> 1:51:13.620
 to me I denominate my wealth in Bitcoin so I think of one

1:51:13.620 --> 1:51:16.420
 Bitcoin is worth one Bitcoin not one Bitcoin is worth 60,000

1:51:16.420 --> 1:51:19.140
 or 55,000 or 70,000 right I denominated everything in

1:51:19.140 --> 1:51:22.340
 Bitcoin when I make a purchase in my head I'm calculating how

1:51:22.340 --> 1:51:25.460
 much Bitcoin am I spending right now right well guess what

1:51:25.460 --> 1:51:28.420
 happens when you have a devaluing currency as the

1:51:28.420 --> 1:51:32.100
 denominator doesn't matter right like your financial

1:51:32.100 --> 1:51:36.100
 incentivize to spend or invest right to consume when you have

1:51:36.100 --> 1:51:41.060
 an appreciating currency all of a sudden you become much less

1:51:41.060 --> 1:51:44.980
 consumptive in your behavior yeah because you're actually

1:51:44.980 --> 1:51:50.580
 trading off future purchasing power for the consumption today

1:51:50.580 --> 1:51:55.380
 it's fascinating to think that if if when you move about this

1:51:55.380 --> 1:51:59.860
 world you think in Bitcoin you behave differently is if you

1:51:59.860 --> 1:52:05.380
 think in dollars that's really fascinating people but here's

1:52:05.380 --> 1:52:09.060
 the thing is the last 50 years or so is actually the outlier

1:52:09.060 --> 1:52:14.500
 in history most people used to think this way yeah it's only

1:52:14.500 --> 1:52:18.740
 when a fiat currency got introduced that one argument the

1:52:18.740 --> 1:52:21.380
 positive argument or perspective is there was an

1:52:21.380 --> 1:52:24.980
 explosion in growth but really it's because there was a

1:52:24.980 --> 1:52:28.820
 financial incentive to consume yeah right and there's nobody

1:52:28.820 --> 1:52:31.620
 better in the world than the United States at consuming and

1:52:31.620 --> 1:52:34.740
 we consume anything and everything and if you want to

1:52:34.740 --> 1:52:37.540
 see a great example look at how big the coca colas are at

1:52:37.540 --> 1:52:40.020
 McDonald's right you know you go to other places they don't

1:52:40.020 --> 1:52:44.500
 serve them that big and so the other example though or the

1:52:44.500 --> 1:52:50.660
 negative argument is we have to consume because if not you end

1:52:50.660 --> 1:52:53.700
 up being the bottom 45% of Americans that help no

1:52:53.700 --> 1:52:56.900
 investable assets and actually are just having their wealth

1:52:56.900 --> 1:53:01.140
 devalued away so holding the dollars end up being a very bad

1:53:01.140 --> 1:53:05.060
 economic decision and so when you then switch to this sound

1:53:05.060 --> 1:53:09.620
 money you say wait a second why would I if today I can trade

1:53:09.620 --> 1:53:13.140
 one Bitcoin you know back in October of last year one Bitcoin

1:53:13.140 --> 1:53:17.620
 for 10 thousand US dollars why would I spend that if at some

1:53:17.620 --> 1:53:20.580
 point in the future whether it's a month from now or 10

1:53:20.580 --> 1:53:23.540
 years from now I could trade it for something much much more

1:53:23.540 --> 1:53:30.340
 than that you just become much more of a anti consumer and

1:53:30.340 --> 1:53:32.980
 much more of a long term thinker yeah from the individual

1:53:32.980 --> 1:53:35.380
 perspective that's pretty powerful I wonder I mean I

1:53:35.380 --> 1:53:38.340
 think that's a interesting debate what's better for the

1:53:38.340 --> 1:53:44.420
 long term economy no better for the growth of the civilization

1:53:44.420 --> 1:53:49.620
 because capitalism is fascinating it seems to it seems

1:53:49.620 --> 1:53:54.340
 to work pretty well there's this kind of like Eric Weinstein

1:53:54.340 --> 1:53:59.300
 says that one of the problems is for the past several decades

1:53:59.300 --> 1:54:03.860
 this whole economy society is built on the idea that we have

1:54:03.860 --> 1:54:08.100
 to keep growing like it depends on that idea and it's a

1:54:08.100 --> 1:54:11.460
 good question whether that's going to result in huge

1:54:11.460 --> 1:54:17.540
 problems or if like a college student on a deadline the

1:54:17.540 --> 1:54:21.780
 the dependence on growth will mean that we'll have to grow

1:54:21.780 --> 1:54:25.620
 like the fear of death will force us to grow but I think

1:54:25.620 --> 1:54:29.300
 there's a false equivalency between we're dependent on

1:54:29.300 --> 1:54:32.660
 growth and then if the world was denominated in sound money

1:54:32.660 --> 1:54:36.980
 we don't grow what I think ends up happening is we remove a

1:54:36.980 --> 1:54:41.300
 lot of the society's bullshit yeah because right now when the

1:54:41.300 --> 1:54:45.140
 money is free or the currency is free you come with all kinds

1:54:45.140 --> 1:54:48.260
 of crazy stuff and people will give it to you right when all

1:54:48.260 --> 1:54:53.060
 of a sudden it's really really valued by the population the

1:54:53.060 --> 1:54:56.900
 decisions are better yeah you you have to provide real value

1:54:56.900 --> 1:54:59.140
 in the goods and services you provide in order to get them to

1:54:59.140 --> 1:55:01.540
 give it to you there's less room for corruption less room

1:55:01.540 --> 1:55:04.740
 for manipulation that's and like that's not actually

1:55:04.740 --> 1:55:10.340
 productive yeah definitely so you said you moved a lot of

1:55:10.340 --> 1:55:16.500
 your investment into bitcoin is there when you look so you're

1:55:16.500 --> 1:55:21.220
 a special human being in many ways so you're like a strategic

1:55:21.220 --> 1:55:23.540
 thinker but you're also like a deep thinker about this whole

1:55:23.540 --> 1:55:27.620
 thing but when you look at a regular club like me in terms

1:55:27.620 --> 1:55:31.540
 of just investing and moving into thinking about

1:55:31.540 --> 1:55:34.740
 cryptocurrency is there a strategy that you recommend

1:55:34.740 --> 1:55:38.420
 what are the different options about investing into bitcoin

1:55:38.420 --> 1:55:41.860
 yeah so i think that there's just uh kind of timeless advice

1:55:41.860 --> 1:55:45.540
 when it comes to uh investing or or acquiring an asset in

1:55:45.540 --> 1:55:48.260
 general uh dollar cost averaging is usually the the

1:55:48.260 --> 1:55:51.780
 best way to think about it and what i mean by that is um most

1:55:51.780 --> 1:55:55.300
 people don't just have a pile of uh currency sitting there

1:55:55.300 --> 1:55:57.060
 right it's not like they have a million dollars sitting in

1:55:57.060 --> 1:56:00.740
 their bank like what do i do with it uh that situation aside

1:56:00.740 --> 1:56:05.460
 what happens is they trade their hours and their effort for

1:56:05.460 --> 1:56:08.500
 currency and so as they get paid every two weeks let's say

1:56:08.500 --> 1:56:12.660
 um the best way to acquire bitcoin without having to worry about timing

1:56:12.660 --> 1:56:15.940
 markets and being a professional trader is to simply take whatever the

1:56:15.940 --> 1:56:19.780
 percentages that you want and to buy bitcoin when you get your

1:56:19.780 --> 1:56:22.820
 paycheck so if you get paid on the first and 15th of every month

1:56:22.820 --> 1:56:25.780
 on that day you should go take you know let's say it's three percent of your

1:56:25.780 --> 1:56:28.260
 paycheck take three percent go buy bitcoin don't

1:56:28.260 --> 1:56:30.820
 worry about what the price is you should do that over time and the

1:56:30.820 --> 1:56:35.220
 reason why that's important is um if in december of 2017 when bitcoin

1:56:35.220 --> 1:56:38.180
 is at twenty thousand dollars it was the height of kind of this last

1:56:38.180 --> 1:56:41.700
 uh big upwards movement you had taken all of your money

1:56:41.700 --> 1:56:45.220
 and you had put it into bitcoin you would have had to wait almost three

1:56:45.220 --> 1:56:48.180
 years just to get back to quote unquote break even

1:56:48.180 --> 1:56:54.820
 in us dollar terms if at the same time you had simply bought then and over the

1:56:54.820 --> 1:56:58.180
 next three years bought every two weeks you would have been up hundreds of

1:56:58.180 --> 1:57:01.460
 percent three years later because what ended up

1:57:01.460 --> 1:57:03.540
 happening was you bought a bunch of bitcoin when it was at

1:57:03.540 --> 1:57:09.620
 15 12 10 9 8 3 4 5 5 5 you know all the way back up on the

1:57:09.620 --> 1:57:12.660
 other side and so dollar cost averaging is one of

1:57:12.660 --> 1:57:17.140
 these weird things that uh it almost sounds too easy but what we

1:57:17.140 --> 1:57:21.300
 find is in america we have a lack of financial education

1:57:21.300 --> 1:57:24.740
 and so rather than try to be smarter than markets what most people are better

1:57:24.740 --> 1:57:27.540
 off doing is just saying hey set your what's called an asset

1:57:27.540 --> 1:57:32.100
 allocation plan i want 30 in stocks i want 10 in real

1:57:32.100 --> 1:57:35.300
 estate i want this this whatever and every time you get your paycheck

1:57:35.300 --> 1:57:38.500
 just think of it as a savings account right just put it in

1:57:38.500 --> 1:57:41.620
 based on those percentages and don't think about it

1:57:41.620 --> 1:57:44.820
 and over a long enough period of time what we find is

1:57:44.820 --> 1:57:48.020
 almost anyone in the united states right there's exceptions but almost anyone in

1:57:48.020 --> 1:57:50.340
 the united states can become a millionaire in their

1:57:50.340 --> 1:57:54.100
 lifetime if they follow these plans and have that long term view and they allow

1:57:54.100 --> 1:57:57.460
 compounding to work for them and so don't look at the price of

1:57:57.460 --> 1:58:00.020
 bitcoin and all that kind of stuff just pick a

1:58:00.020 --> 1:58:04.340
 specific time specific day that you just buy

1:58:04.340 --> 1:58:07.700
 and you just keep buying that's probably good investment advice across any kind

1:58:07.700 --> 1:58:10.420
 of assets it's like if you don't believe in

1:58:10.420 --> 1:58:13.220
 bitcoin and you just want to let's say you just want to do the s&p 500

1:58:13.220 --> 1:58:16.500
 yeah you shouldn't try to time the market of the s&p 500 either right you

1:58:16.500 --> 1:58:18.580
 should just every two weeks you should just buy some

1:58:18.580 --> 1:58:21.860
 and over a 20 year period you're gonna end up buying it at all kinds

1:58:21.860 --> 1:58:24.740
 of different prices but you're gonna get kind of a blended average

1:58:24.740 --> 1:58:28.420
 and the more important thing is the compounding and the time in the market

1:58:28.420 --> 1:58:32.260
 then did you buy it at you know two percent higher or lower than where you

1:58:32.260 --> 1:58:35.300
 bought it doesn't really matter and buying often makes you i guess

1:58:35.300 --> 1:58:40.020
 uh resistant robust to the uh to the volatility of the market or the

1:58:40.020 --> 1:58:46.340
 volatility of bitcoin price and so on that said uh you know bitcoin price

1:58:46.340 --> 1:58:53.620
 is volatile and you know again the argument i've heard

1:58:53.620 --> 1:59:00.340
 is like everything that's going to be a lot more valuable in the future

1:59:00.340 --> 1:59:04.580
 like if you look at the history like companies like apple like teslas

1:59:04.580 --> 1:59:08.740
 now i mean but let's look at companies that

1:59:08.740 --> 1:59:12.660
 have now stabilized right uh apple is a good example

1:59:12.660 --> 1:59:17.140
 it's like volatile in the beginning and so the argument for bitcoin is like

1:59:17.140 --> 1:59:21.540
 yeah this is the early stages because it's going to be a lot more valuable

1:59:21.540 --> 1:59:24.420
 right now it's volatile and this is why you have to have these kinds of

1:59:24.420 --> 1:59:28.500
 strategies to ride out the volatility of course everything that goes to zero is

1:59:28.500 --> 1:59:33.060
 also volatile like the early days are volatile uh

1:59:33.060 --> 1:59:36.740
 do you see like this volatility as like a feature or a bug

1:59:36.740 --> 1:59:40.420
 or is this just like a way of life so amazon is the one that i know the

1:59:40.420 --> 1:59:45.460
 numbers on in terms of early volatility uh every year since it has gone public

1:59:45.460 --> 1:59:50.180
 it's had a double digit drawdown in that year uh the average

1:59:50.180 --> 1:59:55.300
 is over 30 percent and one time it drew down over 95 percent

1:59:55.300 --> 1:59:58.980
 sounds a lot like bitcoin right like oh wow this is crazy

1:59:58.980 --> 2:00:01.860
 but it's one of the best performing stocks in the last 20 years if not the

2:00:01.860 --> 2:00:05.700
 best performing stock and so volatility is not positive or

2:00:05.700 --> 2:00:08.820
 negative it's positive or negative compared to the

2:00:08.820 --> 2:00:12.660
 position you're in so if you're long and it's volatile to the

2:00:12.660 --> 2:00:16.500
 upside it's positive if you're long holding something and

2:00:16.500 --> 2:00:19.460
 it's volatile to the downside you see it as a negative it's all about

2:00:19.460 --> 2:00:23.700
 perspective with that said um another way that i

2:00:23.700 --> 2:00:28.180
 look at this is every asset priced in bitcoin

2:00:28.180 --> 2:00:32.500
 is down significantly so over the last one

2:00:32.500 --> 2:00:36.260
 three five years the dollar priced in bitcoin

2:00:36.260 --> 2:00:41.700
 has crashed 99 percent if you denominate stocks it's down like

2:00:41.700 --> 2:00:44.820
 80 85 if you denominate gold if you

2:00:44.820 --> 2:00:47.700
 denominate bonds if you just go down the line real estate etc

2:00:47.700 --> 2:00:53.060
 it's all down massively against bitcoin now you could argue that that's because

2:00:53.060 --> 2:00:55.700
 bitcoin is appreciating in us dollar terms

2:00:55.700 --> 2:00:58.980
 or you could actually argue that the world is

2:00:58.980 --> 2:01:02.100
 repricing this asset it's doing price discovery on this asset

2:01:02.100 --> 2:01:05.460
 and it's essentially comparing it's saying hey bitcoin verse

2:01:05.460 --> 2:01:08.500
 this stock or bitcoin verse this ounce of gold or bitcoin verse

2:01:08.500 --> 2:01:11.540
 you know this dollar which is more valuable and it continues to move up in

2:01:11.540 --> 2:01:13.700
 the rankings in terms of the value that the world

2:01:13.700 --> 2:01:16.580
 ascribes to this some of that's based on lindy effect just

2:01:16.580 --> 2:01:20.340
 the longer it persists the more likely it is to survive some of that's based on

2:01:20.340 --> 2:01:23.780
 like the underlying fundamentals of how much computing power the usage

2:01:23.780 --> 2:01:28.340
 transaction volume things like that but some of it also is that as more

2:01:28.340 --> 2:01:31.860
 and more people wake up to the fact that it's a finite supply asset that has a

2:01:31.860 --> 2:01:35.220
 place in the world and demand increases people just naturally

2:01:35.220 --> 2:01:38.580
 compete and ascribe more value to it and so the

2:01:38.580 --> 2:01:42.420
 volatility i think all comes back to like what do you

2:01:42.420 --> 2:01:45.780
 price your life in for majority people that's dollars

2:01:45.780 --> 2:01:49.220
 and so you look at the us dollar price you get all this volatility

2:01:49.220 --> 2:01:52.980
 the beauty of this is that 60 that doesn't move regardless of

2:01:52.980 --> 2:01:57.220
 price upward or downward and movement those people aren't looking at the day

2:01:57.220 --> 2:01:59.700
 to day price what they've basically said is i've

2:01:59.700 --> 2:02:04.020
 acquired x amount of bitcoin and i'm just going to hold it for years

2:02:04.020 --> 2:02:07.780
 and every time somebody's done that right if if uh you bought bitcoin at any point

2:02:07.780 --> 2:02:13.700
 in the last 12 years and you held it till today you are up in us dollar terms

2:02:13.700 --> 2:02:18.100
 now if we had this conversation 18 months ago couldn't say that

2:02:18.100 --> 2:02:21.140
 so it's all about not only the acquisition

2:02:21.140 --> 2:02:24.260
 price if you will it's also when are you looking at it

2:02:24.260 --> 2:02:27.380
 right because there was a point in 2017 you could have said the same thing but

2:02:27.380 --> 2:02:30.820
 in 18 you couldn't and so i tend to think a lot about um

2:02:30.820 --> 2:02:33.540
 humans are really really bad at short term

2:02:33.540 --> 2:02:36.580
 uh decision making because we're so emotional

2:02:36.580 --> 2:02:40.580
 especially when something has a price tied to it and so it's in terms of our

2:02:40.580 --> 2:02:43.540
 strategies and decision making we should be long term and have like a

2:02:43.540 --> 2:02:46.500
 regular almost think like an algorithm that

2:02:46.500 --> 2:02:50.260
 in that in that kind of way so i think you've tweeted that

2:02:50.260 --> 2:02:53.700
 you believe that bitcoin has a chance of reaching 1 million i don't know what it

2:02:53.700 --> 2:02:59.700
 is currently i think it's five the 60s which is incredible

2:02:59.700 --> 2:03:03.780
 i think i remember when it was at least in the double digits i think i remember

2:03:03.780 --> 2:03:09.700
 it was in the signal digits of a dollar so the fact that it's cross 50 is crazy

2:03:09.700 --> 2:03:15.220
 uh but uh you're even crazier apparently thinking that it can reach a million

2:03:15.220 --> 2:03:18.580
 so do you think it's possible for it to reach a million is there some kind of

2:03:18.580 --> 2:03:21.140
 transformative effects we have to see first

2:03:21.140 --> 2:03:25.540
 when might it reach a million like what are the signs that we would look for

2:03:25.540 --> 2:03:29.780
 what's required for it to reach a million so let's just look at it from a macro

2:03:29.780 --> 2:03:33.620
 perspective uh gold is a 10 trillion dollar asset

2:03:33.620 --> 2:03:38.020
 and when you compare the technology of gold to the technology of bitcoin

2:03:38.020 --> 2:03:41.620
 bitcoin is superior in every single way right it's more portable it's more

2:03:41.620 --> 2:03:44.260
 divisible uh it's more verifiable it's more

2:03:44.260 --> 2:03:48.100
 scarce on everything and so some people would argue it's a

2:03:48.100 --> 2:03:51.380
 10x improvement some people argue it's 100x improvement from a technology

2:03:51.380 --> 2:03:55.700
 standpoint and so we don't need bitcoin to

2:03:55.700 --> 2:04:00.340
 actually kind of um capture the full 10x or 100x

2:04:00.340 --> 2:04:04.420
 improvement from a market cap standpoint if bitcoin simply captures

2:04:04.420 --> 2:04:08.260
 2x the value be a 20 trillion dollar market cap

2:04:08.260 --> 2:04:10.260
 which would put bitcoin at about a million dollars

2:04:10.260 --> 2:04:13.620
 right so kind of just from a macro perspective if you have a 10x or 100x

2:04:13.620 --> 2:04:17.940
 improvement from a technology standpoint and you directionally get some value

2:04:17.940 --> 2:04:21.780
 capture in that direction you're hitting around a million or more

2:04:21.780 --> 2:04:25.540
 uh dollar price point can ask a quick question which is uh

2:04:25.540 --> 2:04:28.740
 what's the current market cap for bitcoin uh the current market cap is

2:04:28.740 --> 2:04:31.780
 right around a trillion just over a trillion dollars and you're saying gold

2:04:31.780 --> 2:04:35.700
 is 10 trillion and uh sorry where did you get the 20

2:04:35.700 --> 2:04:39.620
 trillion 20 trillion would just be 2x gold market cap

2:04:39.620 --> 2:04:42.740
 got it right so if it's a 10x technology improvement let's just say it only

2:04:42.740 --> 2:04:46.740
 captures 2x the market cap got it right and so again if it was to

2:04:46.740 --> 2:04:49.060
 capture just gold market cap kind of the equivalent

2:04:49.060 --> 2:04:52.740
 puts you around 500 000 right so you can kind of see there's bitcoin

2:04:52.740 --> 2:04:55.940
 so if you capture the entirety of the gold market

2:04:55.940 --> 2:05:00.260
 uh then it would be value of a single bitcoin uh the price of a single bitcoin

2:05:00.260 --> 2:05:04.660
 would be five hundred thousand dollars okay

2:05:04.660 --> 2:05:08.420
 to reach a million it would be double that that's what the 20 trillion comes

2:05:08.420 --> 2:05:11.780
 from correct got it so if you then say to yourself

2:05:11.780 --> 2:05:18.340
 okay how does the uh the pricing um kind of cycles work right or the

2:05:18.340 --> 2:05:23.780
 boom and bust cycles gold is a very um

2:05:23.780 --> 2:05:27.220
 kind of linear type supply schedule meaning that

2:05:27.220 --> 2:05:30.660
 uh there is a certain amount of gold that comes out of the ground each year

2:05:30.660 --> 2:05:35.860
 the interyear variation in that incoming supply is not much

2:05:35.860 --> 2:05:38.980
 right maybe there's an extra mining company that gets set up or a couple of

2:05:38.980 --> 2:05:40.980
 them maybe one goes out of business but for the

2:05:40.980 --> 2:05:46.500
 most part the kind of inflationary uh increase to the supply of gold

2:05:46.500 --> 2:05:52.660
 is pretty stagnant uh year over year bitcoin has a very unique feature which

2:05:52.660 --> 2:05:56.580
 every four years there is a programmatic supply shock

2:05:56.580 --> 2:06:00.500
 meaning that uh in the beginning 50 bitcoin every 10 minutes was introduced

2:06:00.500 --> 2:06:03.380
 into the supply after four years of that happening every

2:06:03.380 --> 2:06:06.900
 10 minutes it was cut in half so on a in a single

2:06:06.900 --> 2:06:11.860
 moment it went from 50 to now it was 25 four years every 10 minutes 25 got cut

2:06:11.860 --> 2:06:16.900
 in half again to 12 and a half and then recently in may 2020 got cut to 6.25

2:06:16.900 --> 2:06:20.500
 when you have an asset that is determined the price

2:06:20.500 --> 2:06:23.460
 based on supply and demand you normally have

2:06:23.460 --> 2:06:27.540
 two inputs to the equation what is the supply and what is the demand

2:06:27.540 --> 2:06:31.060
 in an asset like gold or a stock or anything else

2:06:31.060 --> 2:06:34.180
 we have to do our best guess at the supply

2:06:34.180 --> 2:06:37.700
 both the existing supply and the incoming supply and do our best guess at

2:06:37.700 --> 2:06:40.820
 the demand and we're actually pretty good at this a lot of times in terms of

2:06:40.820 --> 2:06:44.020
 directionally saying it's going to go up or down and here's kind of some price

2:06:44.020 --> 2:06:48.180
 point milestones bitcoin's unique in that there's 100

2:06:48.180 --> 2:06:52.740
 verifiable proof of the existing supply

2:06:52.740 --> 2:06:56.180
 the total supply and the incoming daily supply

2:06:56.180 --> 2:06:59.620
 so we know 100 i can show you on the actual blockchain

2:06:59.620 --> 2:07:03.620
 or in the code that there's 21 million bitcoin and that's all there will ever

2:07:03.620 --> 2:07:06.820
 be i can show you that there's 18.6 million

2:07:06.820 --> 2:07:09.860
 give or take bitcoin that actually are in circulation

2:07:09.860 --> 2:07:12.500
 today right and i can go all the way back to every single transaction that's ever

2:07:12.500 --> 2:07:15.300
 occurred since january 2009 and then i can show you on a daily

2:07:15.300 --> 2:07:18.820
 basis that 900 bitcoin a day are coming into the circulating supply

2:07:18.820 --> 2:07:22.660
 and so when you have 100 confidence because you can prove

2:07:22.660 --> 2:07:26.180
 the supply side of this equation you can hold it constant

2:07:26.180 --> 2:07:31.860
 i know with 100 accuracy the supply side so now i've reduced the mathematical

2:07:31.860 --> 2:07:34.900
 equation that i need to do to determine price movements

2:07:34.900 --> 2:07:38.420
 to a 50 reduction i only have to worry about demand i don't have to worry about

2:07:38.420 --> 2:07:41.380
 supply and so when i look at demand i can do

2:07:41.380 --> 2:07:44.580
 all kinds of things i can take the demand over the last 10 years and

2:07:44.580 --> 2:07:47.460
 the growth and just extrapolate it out i can increase it i can decrease it

2:07:47.460 --> 2:07:51.700
 whatever but what you find is that these supply

2:07:51.700 --> 2:07:55.700
 shocks lead to significant price appreciation

2:07:55.700 --> 2:07:59.860
 as the asset gets repriced because there there's a supply shock to

2:07:59.860 --> 2:08:03.700
 and so probably the best thing that i've done over the last couple of years

2:08:03.700 --> 2:08:07.940
 was in 2019 i started to talk about the idea that we were going to have both a

2:08:07.940 --> 2:08:13.140
 supply shock and the demand shock in 2021

2:08:13.140 --> 2:08:17.620
 or i'm sorry in 2020 i didn't know when this bull market that we were in was

2:08:17.620 --> 2:08:20.340
 going to end nobody knows right it's impossible to time

2:08:20.340 --> 2:08:23.620
 these things but you could tell that we were kind of at late stages of a cycle

2:08:23.620 --> 2:08:27.940
 there was inverted yield curves there was rep uh gyrations in the repo markets

2:08:27.940 --> 2:08:31.620
 a lot of ceos leaving their jobs you know all this kind of stuff

2:08:31.620 --> 2:08:34.980
 and all i said was at some point when the market turns over

2:08:34.980 --> 2:08:37.940
 the government's gonna have to step in we were addicted to stimulus they're

2:08:37.940 --> 2:08:40.180
 gonna have to manipulate interest rates down and they're gonna have to print

2:08:40.180 --> 2:08:43.380
 money i had no clue that there was going to be a global

2:08:43.380 --> 2:08:45.700
 pandemic that they were going to have to step in

2:08:45.700 --> 2:08:49.620
 in such an aggressive way and move rates not down but down to zero

2:08:49.620 --> 2:08:52.100
 and that they not only were going to print hundreds of billions but they could

2:08:52.100 --> 2:08:56.420
 print trillions of dollars but the framework that i used to think

2:08:56.420 --> 2:09:00.420
 about this was when they do that everyone is going to

2:09:00.420 --> 2:09:03.860
 run to store value assets they're going to run the gold they're going to run the

2:09:03.860 --> 2:09:07.540
 bitcoin etc and right as they do that it appears at

2:09:07.540 --> 2:09:09.540
 the same time there's going to be this supply shock

2:09:09.540 --> 2:09:12.420
 so you're gonna get a supply shock and a demand shock that are both positive for

2:09:12.420 --> 2:09:15.940
 the the price i called it rocket fuel for bitcoin

2:09:15.940 --> 2:09:20.980
 well it happened and here we are i now look forward and i say okay we are

2:09:20.980 --> 2:09:22.900
 likely going to see a hundred thousand bitcoin

2:09:22.900 --> 2:09:25.700
 a hundred thousand dollar bitcoin this year or at some point i don't know when

2:09:25.700 --> 2:09:28.740
 it happens but we're moving in that so you think in 2021 we'll see a hundred

2:09:28.740 --> 2:09:32.740
 thousand that would be uh my most conservative

2:09:32.740 --> 2:09:35.540
 view uh i i've said a hundred thousand dollars

2:09:35.540 --> 2:09:38.820
 since 2019 and people thought that was insane and

2:09:38.820 --> 2:09:41.780
 crazy and all stuff now i'm the conservative guy in the room

2:09:41.780 --> 2:09:44.260
 because i stick with a hundred thousand dollars and people are saying

2:09:44.260 --> 2:09:48.820
 you know multiples of that number here uh so we'll see what happens but

2:09:48.820 --> 2:09:52.100
 but i think that there's still a lot of room kind of to run from a us dollar

2:09:52.100 --> 2:09:56.100
 price standpoint what is on the horizon is in 2024 we

2:09:56.100 --> 2:09:59.940
 will have another supply shock and so that's what i think will carry

2:09:59.940 --> 2:10:04.500
 us to the million dollar bitcoin from 6 to 5 to whatever 50 reduction yeah

2:10:04.500 --> 2:10:06.900
 yeah and so that's what i think uh well

2:10:06.900 --> 2:10:10.020
 basically when we get that that next supply shock that'll carry us up over a

2:10:10.020 --> 2:10:15.780
 hundred or over a one million dollar bitcoin price which if historical

2:10:15.780 --> 2:10:20.100
 examples persist and again sometimes it's hard to use historical examples to

2:10:20.100 --> 2:10:23.780
 look at future events um but if that happens we would see

2:10:23.780 --> 2:10:27.380
 a million dollars of bitcoin by the end of 2026

2:10:27.380 --> 2:10:32.420
 after that wave so 2024 basically is the supply shock and within

2:10:32.420 --> 2:10:35.540
 you know 18 to 24 months you would see the uh

2:10:35.540 --> 2:10:39.140
 the kind of top of the next market hopefully without a coupling to the net

2:10:39.140 --> 2:10:44.020
 to another pandemic yes we we would like to do all of this without a

2:10:44.020 --> 2:10:47.860
 public health crisis so that would take it to

2:10:47.860 --> 2:10:51.540
 20 trillion you don't have to compare it to the dollar

2:10:51.540 --> 2:10:55.780
 essentially in some sense that the dollar could also lose value i mean

2:10:55.780 --> 2:10:58.660
 there's a lot of kind of dynamics at play here

2:10:58.660 --> 2:11:02.020
 now but like fundamentally there's going to be a huge

2:11:02.020 --> 2:11:06.420
 move uh in your prediction of uh value into into bitcoin

2:11:06.420 --> 2:11:10.340
 i mean that's a fascinating world uh to think about

2:11:10.340 --> 2:11:16.180
 uh i mean but i do have to kind of ask you about the whole space of

2:11:16.180 --> 2:11:19.140
 technology there because we're talking about the value of security we're

2:11:19.140 --> 2:11:22.820
 talking about the the future which bitcoin will be at the

2:11:22.820 --> 2:11:26.980
 center of but from my perspective of

2:11:26.980 --> 2:11:31.540
 thinking how like i and others can build technologies on top of

2:11:31.540 --> 2:11:35.140
 this kind of decentralized world i'm thinking about different

2:11:35.140 --> 2:11:38.340
 different technologies out there different cryptocurrencies out there

2:11:38.340 --> 2:11:42.100
 ethereum being one but there's a lot of others

2:11:42.100 --> 2:11:45.300
 so i'd love to get your sort of ideas about some of these but

2:11:45.300 --> 2:11:50.180
 so first let me ask you about what the hell is shit coin

2:11:50.180 --> 2:11:54.900
 is this connected to uh to our previous discussion of the meme

2:11:54.900 --> 2:11:59.460
 uh this shit coin cover basically all coins that are not

2:11:59.460 --> 2:12:05.620
 bitcoin is it uh uh mean is it a beautiful is it's a mixture of

2:12:05.620 --> 2:12:08.660
 both as with most things in life uh depends

2:12:08.660 --> 2:12:14.100
 who you ask um the uh most um

2:12:14.100 --> 2:12:19.140
 kind of enthusiastic and uh uh parts of the bitcoin community shit

2:12:19.140 --> 2:12:23.300
 coin is anything else right kind of if you ascribe to kind

2:12:23.300 --> 2:12:27.060
 of a maximalistic view of the world shit crime be anything if you look at

2:12:27.060 --> 2:12:31.780
 people who i would say are bitcoin proponents uh yet

2:12:31.780 --> 2:12:35.700
 see value in other things shit coin may be the bottom half

2:12:35.700 --> 2:12:39.620
 of the other things right so i think again it's really important kind of who

2:12:39.620 --> 2:12:42.100
 you ask is how you'll get that answer so

2:12:42.100 --> 2:12:45.700
 there's tiers and the way you divide those tiers might be different depending

2:12:45.700 --> 2:12:48.980
 who you ask ultimately what it is is it's a meme yeah

2:12:48.980 --> 2:12:54.500
 and it's used to uh articulate the idea that whatever you want to put in

2:12:54.500 --> 2:12:57.860
 that bucket has no value so shit coin right are coins that have

2:12:57.860 --> 2:13:02.260
 no value yeah uh what is fascinating about it and i

2:13:02.260 --> 2:13:05.060
 think that again speaks to the power of the bitcoin community

2:13:05.060 --> 2:13:08.580
 is uh there was congressional hearings a couple years ago

2:13:08.580 --> 2:13:13.460
 oh no and at one point uh a congressman from ohio warren davidson who uh

2:13:13.460 --> 2:13:17.860
 who's definitely uh open minded and excited about bitcoin

2:13:17.860 --> 2:13:20.900
 asked a an individual on the congress floor

2:13:20.900 --> 2:13:26.740
 uh during testimony to uh talk about these other coins and at one point

2:13:26.740 --> 2:13:31.300
 basically read into the record the terminology of shit coin

2:13:31.300 --> 2:13:34.900
 he said the word shit coin uh i can't remember if he said it first

2:13:34.900 --> 2:13:38.340
 somebody else did or if uh the other person did and then he uh um

2:13:38.340 --> 2:13:42.180
 you know repeated it that's awesome but he definitely he was trying to get that

2:13:42.180 --> 2:13:46.420
 read into the record yes uh for sure and so uh you know you

2:13:46.420 --> 2:13:50.980
 can imagine one again the meme speaking insolently to

2:13:50.980 --> 2:13:54.180
 the bitcoin community was you know made him very uh very well

2:13:54.180 --> 2:14:00.020
 liked uh but also too was um it does go back to this idea almost of

2:14:00.020 --> 2:14:05.460
 uh if you and i sat down with 10 ceos and we interviewed each one of them and

2:14:05.460 --> 2:14:07.940
 then we went in a room and we deliberated and we said we have to pick

2:14:07.940 --> 2:14:10.820
 the person who's going to be the most successful

2:14:10.820 --> 2:14:13.540
 one of the inputs not all the inputs but one of the inputs would be

2:14:13.540 --> 2:14:16.900
 who's the person who we believe has the best ability to

2:14:16.900 --> 2:14:20.180
 raise capital recruit people and tell a story

2:14:20.180 --> 2:14:26.020
 to the world that will get them to follow and so somebody like elon would

2:14:26.020 --> 2:14:30.740
 probably be the best example of this when you have decentralized products you

2:14:30.740 --> 2:14:34.340
 have no kind of leader right in the sense of somebody who is

2:14:34.340 --> 2:14:37.620
 financially ascribed to be that leader and kind of the

2:14:37.620 --> 2:14:40.260
 executive decision maker so what you have to do is you have to

2:14:40.260 --> 2:14:43.140
 look at these technologies in these communities and say

2:14:43.140 --> 2:14:48.260
 well which volunteer teams or which technologies have been able to coalesce

2:14:48.260 --> 2:14:53.380
 these groups around it and in some way build the same level of

2:14:53.380 --> 2:14:57.460
 engagement and protection and things like that and so

2:14:57.460 --> 2:15:00.820
 you actually get tribalism but you also get things like

2:15:00.820 --> 2:15:05.380
 shitcoin because what it does is it's not only a um

2:15:05.380 --> 2:15:12.100
 kind of verbal attack towards uh others it's a rallying cry for

2:15:12.100 --> 2:15:16.500
 internal what's so funny is that it was started with the bitcoin community

2:15:16.500 --> 2:15:19.780
 talking about everybody but now you've seen adoption in other communities who

2:15:19.780 --> 2:15:21.700
 use it you know basically say well we're not a

2:15:21.700 --> 2:15:26.020
 shitcoin it's the it's the next guy yeah i mean the meaning to be honest

2:15:26.020 --> 2:15:29.380
 it's it's one it's off it's sometimes

2:15:29.380 --> 2:15:32.900
 misused i think like with anything it's like

2:15:32.900 --> 2:15:37.540
 people adopt memes that used to be brilliant or still brilliant

2:15:37.540 --> 2:15:40.980
 and they're just not good at using them so they become

2:15:40.980 --> 2:15:47.300
 mean uh but when you do with with grace it can tear down an

2:15:47.300 --> 2:15:51.220
 argument and at the same time have like love and

2:15:51.220 --> 2:15:54.820
 respect underneath it i mean it's a beautiful dance they have to be good at

2:15:54.820 --> 2:15:59.060
 like you know people just can suck at communication and even

2:15:59.060 --> 2:16:02.820
 uh like even a powerful weapon like a meme in the wrong hands

2:16:02.820 --> 2:16:09.460
 just uh fires in a way that doesn't get anything done but this is like a war

2:16:09.460 --> 2:16:13.620
 of humor and memes it's kind of fascinating exactly like you formulated

2:16:13.620 --> 2:16:16.740
 that there's a symmetry of power so you have to

2:16:16.740 --> 2:16:22.740
 have guerrilla warfare in this internet game especially when there's no leader

2:16:22.740 --> 2:16:26.900
 like you said in a distributed culture i would say here that is um

2:16:26.900 --> 2:16:31.300
 is really important i think is from a society standpoint

2:16:31.300 --> 2:16:37.540
 we've become very soft and very kind of coddling and not in um

2:16:37.540 --> 2:16:40.660
 not in a way that's like i think people take this argument like too far

2:16:40.660 --> 2:16:45.380
 sometimes but what i mean by that is um it's almost like if you're the person

2:16:45.380 --> 2:16:49.060
 who holds somebody accountable you become the bad person right if you're

2:16:49.060 --> 2:16:53.380
 the person who um says hey you know that's wrong you're

2:16:53.380 --> 2:16:57.620
 the bad person right and so in a world where i think in um

2:16:57.620 --> 2:17:02.180
 this kind of influencery you know all positive if you have any negative

2:17:02.180 --> 2:17:06.020
 you know feedback or constructive criticism like you're the bad person

2:17:06.020 --> 2:17:11.780
 uh it's the ultimate echo chamber right and so i think that what the bitcoin

2:17:11.780 --> 2:17:15.860
 world does in in some crazy crazy way to look

2:17:15.860 --> 2:17:20.180
 at it is bitcoin is ultimately about truth

2:17:20.180 --> 2:17:26.420
 not about narrative not about feelings or emotion it's math yeah

2:17:26.420 --> 2:17:30.340
 you look at a blockchain and you can prove something

2:17:30.340 --> 2:17:34.500
 or you can't and so naturally people who are attracted to that

2:17:34.500 --> 2:17:37.860
 have a very similar approach in life yeah right they say hey

2:17:37.860 --> 2:17:41.060
 you made x claim prove it and as you can imagine

2:17:41.060 --> 2:17:45.700
 you know a great example is like the financial media meets bitcoiners

2:17:45.700 --> 2:17:50.900
 and it's a bloodbath right in kind of the the arena of ideas because

2:17:50.900 --> 2:17:54.020
 what do they do the financial media is used to the soft

2:17:54.020 --> 2:17:57.700
 you know opinion pieces etc and bitcoiners show up and they're like

2:17:57.700 --> 2:18:01.300
 uh here's data point a b and c here's example one two and three

2:18:01.300 --> 2:18:05.060
 and you're wrong and then all they yell and scream about is like

2:18:05.060 --> 2:18:08.420
 uh i'm wrong i'm wrong i'm wrong like you can't say i'm wrong and they're like

2:18:08.420 --> 2:18:12.260
 nerd like disprove what i just said and so you get in this like very very weird

2:18:12.260 --> 2:18:14.340
 it's fascinating it's a fascinating battlefield but

2:18:14.340 --> 2:18:17.780
 i i do want to say it's i've been watching this

2:18:17.780 --> 2:18:23.540
 it's kind of interesting i think that the pursuit of truth

2:18:23.540 --> 2:18:29.460
 like tearing down bad ideas can be done with grace and to do it with

2:18:29.460 --> 2:18:32.660
 grace requires a lot of skill like what people

2:18:32.660 --> 2:18:38.900
 don't realize about disagreement they think that disagreement is easy

2:18:38.900 --> 2:18:44.500
 like they they see the the the lies or the inaccuracies in the

2:18:44.500 --> 2:18:47.220
 statement and and they just think they can say

2:18:47.220 --> 2:18:51.860
 wrong uh yes you can say that but if you want

2:18:51.860 --> 2:18:57.300
 to be effective it requires great skill like you look at

2:18:57.300 --> 2:19:03.620
 i don't know um a beautiful uh verbal shit poster which is Christopher

2:19:03.620 --> 2:19:08.020
 Hitchens right it requires a lot of skill

2:19:08.020 --> 2:19:11.860
 through your words to tear down an argument

2:19:11.860 --> 2:19:16.660
 to criticize and to take a step towards truth

2:19:16.660 --> 2:19:20.900
 what i'm disheartened by internet culture like the negative side

2:19:20.900 --> 2:19:25.140
 is people don't put a lot of effort in their tear downs

2:19:25.140 --> 2:19:29.060
 like into your shit posting into your memes

2:19:29.060 --> 2:19:34.820
 you should put effort and see it as a skill that you want to if you want to be

2:19:34.820 --> 2:19:39.540
 a part of this culture you want to uh get good at it

2:19:39.540 --> 2:19:45.860
 like any skill it's the 10 000 hours like get improve deliberate practice

2:19:45.860 --> 2:19:50.580
 self criticism all of those things uh just because you're anonymous

2:19:50.580 --> 2:19:55.060
 doesn't mean you won't get deep joy and actually have an impact on the world if

2:19:55.060 --> 2:19:59.620
 you get good at shitposting but but i think this is really really

2:19:59.620 --> 2:20:01.300
 important right because you're right in that

2:20:01.300 --> 2:20:05.300
 uh it's all about intention versus action if your intention is to

2:20:05.300 --> 2:20:09.220
 uh tell somebody that they are wrong in an effort to get them to

2:20:09.220 --> 2:20:12.500
 see the truth yes that's very different than if your intention is to tell

2:20:12.500 --> 2:20:14.420
 someone they're wrong and hurt their feelings yes

2:20:14.420 --> 2:20:18.660
 right and so when you can unpack intention and action

2:20:18.660 --> 2:20:22.100
 you really quickly can tell what somebody ultimately is trying to

2:20:22.100 --> 2:20:25.620
 accomplish i also think that one of the craziest

2:20:25.620 --> 2:20:30.180
 things that i've seen play out is uh memes when i use that term i'm not

2:20:30.180 --> 2:20:32.900
 just talking about like a static photo right when i'm talking about these

2:20:32.900 --> 2:20:35.940
 elaborate uh kind of edited videos and kind of

2:20:35.940 --> 2:20:41.620
 all this stuff um when done right it is

2:20:41.620 --> 2:20:47.620
 uh the most articulate way to deliver a blunt message and it's

2:20:47.620 --> 2:20:51.300
 done in such a way that is humorous and entertaining

2:20:51.300 --> 2:20:57.380
 yet really hammers the point home and so it's a skill set that many people don't

2:20:57.380 --> 2:21:00.100
 have i don't make those i'm assuming you don't make them either

2:21:00.100 --> 2:21:03.060
 right i see them i share the ones that i like right

2:21:03.060 --> 2:21:06.420
 uh but it does take practice and you can tell

2:21:06.420 --> 2:21:10.340
 look there's people who are fantastic meme lords right and there are

2:21:10.340 --> 2:21:15.780
 people who absolutely suck at it and it's like anything it's just

2:21:15.780 --> 2:21:20.340
 how good are you at communicating and uh i've heard the idea a bunch of times so

2:21:20.340 --> 2:21:24.180
 i don't know who to kind of credit for it but uh whether it's emojis

2:21:24.180 --> 2:21:29.140
 it's gifs it's memes whatever this is the extension and evolution of

2:21:29.140 --> 2:21:33.460
 just hieroglyphics right yeah like like we have been doing

2:21:33.460 --> 2:21:36.820
 this for literally centuries it's just that now we're doing it on

2:21:36.820 --> 2:21:38.660
 the internet you can press a button and go to

2:21:38.660 --> 2:21:43.140
 millions and millions of people immediately uh but speaking of memes

2:21:43.140 --> 2:21:48.260
 what the heck do you think is up with elon musk talking about dogecoin a lot

2:21:48.260 --> 2:21:51.780
 sort of uh from the cryptocurrency community i

2:21:51.780 --> 2:21:56.100
 from i've been talking to a lot of sort of technologists i guess

2:21:56.100 --> 2:21:59.380
 and reading papers on cryptocurrency it's like

2:21:59.380 --> 2:22:04.100
 nobody really sees dogecoin as a revolutionary

2:22:04.100 --> 2:22:07.940
 crypto technology a lot of people talk about it's security issues there's a

2:22:07.940 --> 2:22:13.380
 bunch of issues it has nevertheless you did say that money is the

2:22:13.380 --> 2:22:19.380
 kind of social construct right and uh elon musk's

2:22:19.380 --> 2:22:24.020
 combination of humor and brilliant engineering in the various

2:22:24.020 --> 2:22:29.140
 companies he runs combines to create a kind of value

2:22:29.140 --> 2:22:32.660
 and excitement behind dogecoin it's like

2:22:32.660 --> 2:22:38.980
 um what is it he says uh that the most amusing outcome is the most likely

2:22:38.980 --> 2:22:44.580
 kind of idea which sounds silly but there could be like profound truth to it

2:22:44.580 --> 2:22:50.340
 it's like what do you make of dogecoin philosophically or technically is is it

2:22:50.340 --> 2:22:55.380
 possible that dogecoin will overtake bitcoin and run the

2:22:55.380 --> 2:22:59.380
 run the entire world i can't even because it could happen

2:22:59.380 --> 2:23:04.740
 it could happen but what uh if there's any serious way to answer that question

2:23:04.740 --> 2:23:12.020
 well we have to start with uh techno king of tesla yeah and master of coin

2:23:12.020 --> 2:23:15.860
 as they are so articulately called in the latest scc filing

2:23:15.860 --> 2:23:19.460
 he officially changed his title techno king yes no king of tesla

2:23:19.460 --> 2:23:24.020
 and the cfo's new uh title is a master of coin

2:23:24.020 --> 2:23:32.100
 and so uh when you have a sense of humor yeah and frankly uh a level of uh

2:23:32.100 --> 2:23:39.540
 self confidence and uh an element of uh an appreciation for irony in the world

2:23:39.540 --> 2:23:44.340
 dogecoin is actually one of the least crazy things that you could talk about

2:23:44.340 --> 2:23:48.180
 when you're willing to go to techno king of tesla master of coin

2:23:48.180 --> 2:23:51.540
 uh and all this stuff and so i think that

2:23:51.540 --> 2:23:55.540
 elon uh doesn't get enough credit frankly for his understanding of internet

2:23:55.540 --> 2:23:58.900
 culture understanding of memes and understanding

2:23:58.900 --> 2:24:02.660
 of frankly human psychology and marketing and so

2:24:02.660 --> 2:24:06.740
 in some crazy way every time he talks about dogecoin

2:24:06.740 --> 2:24:09.860
 it's a rallying cry for an entire generation of kids

2:24:09.860 --> 2:24:13.700
 it's a rallying cry for an entire industry uh in terms of cryptocurrencies

2:24:13.700 --> 2:24:19.060
 and digital technologies but this is the flag yeah

2:24:19.060 --> 2:24:22.020
 and this is the thing that he can yell and scream about

2:24:22.020 --> 2:24:26.020
 and tweet about without worry of punishment

2:24:26.020 --> 2:24:29.620
 so he could be talking about bitcoin he could be talking about cryptocurrency

2:24:29.620 --> 2:24:33.460
 but that's not going to be uh as beautifully

2:24:33.460 --> 2:24:37.380
 humorous and whatever the hell internet culture is as dogecoin

2:24:37.380 --> 2:24:40.980
 he's finding the right language he's speaking the language of the people

2:24:40.980 --> 2:24:45.380
 of the of the in the digital age if you want to reach weird people

2:24:45.380 --> 2:24:49.220
 yeah you can't be serious and most people are weird

2:24:49.220 --> 2:24:52.740
 the masses are weird so he's speaking to the masses

2:24:52.740 --> 2:24:56.420
 yeah and the techno king and even further than that i think is

2:24:56.420 --> 2:25:04.100
 he essentially is um he's using dogecoin as a way to say

2:25:04.100 --> 2:25:08.020
 i'm doing this because i can yeah he couldn't do it

2:25:08.020 --> 2:25:13.300
 with securities he couldn't do it with certain types of other assets right

2:25:13.300 --> 2:25:16.020
 like i almost look at it as like a venn diagram what's the thing that a bunch of

2:25:16.020 --> 2:25:19.700
 people know about care about thinkers funny whatever and

2:25:19.700 --> 2:25:21.700
 also overlay that with the things that like he

2:25:21.700 --> 2:25:24.180
 could actually talk about they won't get in trouble for

2:25:24.180 --> 2:25:27.380
 that's a big f you to the sec i could see the

2:25:27.380 --> 2:25:30.660
 the people just freaking out i i mean i love it

2:25:30.660 --> 2:25:34.580
 but um i i don't know if i would have the guts to do it myself

2:25:34.580 --> 2:25:37.860
 but i i think he's an inspiration to a lot of us

2:25:37.860 --> 2:25:40.900
 to be like well maybe you should grow the guts

2:25:40.900 --> 2:25:45.220
 when you're the techno king you can do whatever you want right

2:25:45.860 --> 2:25:49.700
 and i mean that's something to aspire to is to be the techno king in your own

2:25:49.700 --> 2:25:52.500
 little world if you also think about it in the sense

2:25:52.500 --> 2:25:58.100
 of uh when you're somebody on a mission to create interplanetary

2:25:58.100 --> 2:26:05.300
 life yeah when you're trying to solve a or put a dent in the climate crisis

2:26:05.300 --> 2:26:08.660
 or create electric vehicles and be the first american company and you know

2:26:08.660 --> 2:26:13.380
 however long frankly the sec

2:26:13.380 --> 2:26:16.740
 or other things in your life that just don't

2:26:16.740 --> 2:26:20.660
 you don't ascribe that much importance to compared to those things

2:26:20.660 --> 2:26:25.540
 they're almost uh nuisances and that's scary i think for shareholders

2:26:25.540 --> 2:26:28.820
 of a company when the person that you're trusting to lead

2:26:28.820 --> 2:26:31.620
 you to the promised land and create shareholder value

2:26:31.620 --> 2:26:36.260
 doesn't put value on certain things but at the same time

2:26:36.260 --> 2:26:40.820
 i always look at it as a tug of war how much of the actions of what he's doing

2:26:40.820 --> 2:26:44.100
 and calling attention to actually change the way

2:26:44.100 --> 2:26:50.660
 that regulators lawmakers politicians countries whatever act he may not be

2:26:50.660 --> 2:26:55.300
 able to say do acts i'm the techno king and they go do it

2:26:55.300 --> 2:27:01.700
 but with every step he makes he changes some of their behavior and so i

2:27:01.700 --> 2:27:07.140
 think that it's um a really kind of game of like 3d chess

2:27:07.140 --> 2:27:11.220
 that frankly i'm not privy to right i'm kind of watching from the sidelines and

2:27:11.220 --> 2:27:17.060
 uh figuring out alongside everybody else but i also don't think that it's just

2:27:17.060 --> 2:27:20.580
 elon uh bought a bunch of dogecoin and tweets about it because he thinks he's

2:27:20.580 --> 2:27:23.380
 going to a dollar and he's gonna you know make money right like i don't think

2:27:23.380 --> 2:27:26.340
 i don't think it's an economic argument as to why he's so

2:27:26.340 --> 2:27:31.780
 interested in i think it's much more uh it's almost like meta message

2:27:31.780 --> 2:27:35.060
 for a lot of other stuff yeah he's kind of

2:27:35.060 --> 2:27:38.820
 trying to break apart internet communication from first principles like

2:27:38.820 --> 2:27:42.100
 it does so many other problems it's kind of fascinating to watch i know he's been

2:27:42.100 --> 2:27:45.540
 uh he's he's taught me quite a bit about communication

2:27:45.540 --> 2:27:52.980
 and uh at least for me it's been liberating to not give a fuck

2:27:52.980 --> 2:27:57.940
 about the old school way of things i've been always bothered by

2:27:57.940 --> 2:28:01.540
 a place i deeply admire which is mit but there's

2:28:01.540 --> 2:28:05.620
 problems the bureaucracies and hierarchies that hold back innovation

2:28:05.620 --> 2:28:10.820
 brilliant minds and in that sense doge is a kind of fu to

2:28:10.820 --> 2:28:15.060
 the system that's kind of positive but also

2:28:15.060 --> 2:28:22.500
 uh kind of uh but it was also an fu so in that sense i think

2:28:22.500 --> 2:28:26.180
 elon has a perspective on the world that's similar to bitcoin folks

2:28:26.180 --> 2:28:30.100
 which i really like which is like thinking long term

2:28:30.100 --> 2:28:35.460
 it's how visionaries think is like how will if i take these ideas

2:28:35.460 --> 2:28:42.260
 what and the ideas hold true what will the world look like in 20 30

2:28:42.260 --> 2:28:45.380
 50 years and think about everything in that way

2:28:45.380 --> 2:28:51.460
 yeah i like uh bezos's view which is uh is essentially how do you minimize

2:28:51.460 --> 2:28:55.300
 regret how do you accelerate your life mentally

2:28:55.300 --> 2:28:59.060
 and go to 80 90 100 150 years whatever we end up

2:28:59.060 --> 2:29:02.420
 being you know fortunate enough to live to and then look backwards

2:29:02.420 --> 2:29:06.340
 yes and say this decision that i'm going to make i have two

2:29:06.340 --> 2:29:10.100
 options which one is going to be the one that i least regret

2:29:10.100 --> 2:29:13.140
 and if you continue to make decisions that way

2:29:13.140 --> 2:29:15.700
 one you have that long term view kind of built in because you're working

2:29:15.700 --> 2:29:19.300
 backwards uh two you are ultimately going to optimize

2:29:19.300 --> 2:29:23.620
 for uh minimal regret but also three is

2:29:23.620 --> 2:29:27.620
 even if you only look forward 10 years that's much much further than most

2:29:27.620 --> 2:29:29.300
 people do and so it gives you a significant

2:29:29.300 --> 2:29:33.620
 advantage and i think that um bitcoin has kind of this like um

2:29:33.620 --> 2:29:36.820
 you know proxy for time as we talked about uh

2:29:36.820 --> 2:29:41.940
 interplant uh planetary travel where there's multiple steps from creating a

2:29:41.940 --> 2:29:46.260
 reusable rocket to landing it to you know all this stuff all the way

2:29:46.260 --> 2:29:49.860
 to simple things just like if you're simply trying to figure out

2:29:49.860 --> 2:29:52.500
 where the world's going to be 30 years from now

2:29:52.500 --> 2:29:56.020
 you know bill gates says that we overestimate what we can do in one year

2:29:56.020 --> 2:30:02.580
 underestimate what we can do in 10 well to me it's a um kind of degree of

2:30:02.580 --> 2:30:07.860
 uh mistake if you will 10 years maybe you're off by 10 percent

2:30:07.860 --> 2:30:11.860
 well if that line of progress continues 20 years you may be off by

2:30:11.860 --> 2:30:15.620
 100 and 30 years you may be off by a thousand percent

2:30:15.620 --> 2:30:20.500
 right like almost the further you go out the more inaccurate you become

2:30:20.500 --> 2:30:26.100
 and so i think that people who want to iterate their way to success right

2:30:26.100 --> 2:30:29.060
 that's a common thing in like the startup world

2:30:29.060 --> 2:30:33.940
 end up actually following kind of the breadcrumbs to where the

2:30:33.940 --> 2:30:38.100
 world is taking them but people like an elon musk a jeff

2:30:38.100 --> 2:30:41.060
 bezos a jack dorsey all the way down the line all these

2:30:41.060 --> 2:30:45.060
 innovators they actually say to themselves there is

2:30:45.060 --> 2:30:48.820
 a point in time in the future where there's a world i want to

2:30:48.820 --> 2:30:52.420
 construct and then they go and they construct it

2:30:52.420 --> 2:30:56.260
 regardless of the short term iterations and incentives

2:30:56.260 --> 2:30:59.220
 it is just they're driving towards that point and i think that it's this whole

2:30:59.220 --> 2:31:03.780
 idea of having this like you know kind of set vision and this

2:31:03.780 --> 2:31:07.700
 uh refusal to kind of move or budge off of that

2:31:07.700 --> 2:31:11.300
 that's what makes them special one of the

2:31:11.300 --> 2:31:14.260
 things that garnered a lot of excitement in the crypto

2:31:14.260 --> 2:31:21.300
 community is nfts i i have no idea really the depths the

2:31:21.300 --> 2:31:26.340
 fundamental technological philosophical depths of the second of this technology

2:31:26.340 --> 2:31:30.180
 whether this is just like a little bit of a fad or there's some deep lessons to

2:31:30.180 --> 2:31:33.460
 learn whether it's bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general about it

2:31:33.460 --> 2:31:38.500
 do you have thoughts about like the long lasting fundamental aspects of nfts

2:31:38.500 --> 2:31:41.940
 i think there's probably both things happening fad

2:31:41.940 --> 2:31:47.220
 and things to learn right and um if we just start with like what is an

2:31:47.220 --> 2:31:52.020
 nft it's a non fungible token meaning that um there's no fungibility

2:31:52.020 --> 2:31:56.020
 and fungibility is a fancy word um i always describe it as

2:31:56.020 --> 2:31:58.580
 if i took a hundred dollar bill and i put it on the table with a bunch of the

2:31:58.580 --> 2:32:01.220
 hundred dollar bills and we mixed them up and i just grabbed a hundred dollar

2:32:01.220 --> 2:32:04.420
 bill and left i'm no worse as long as they're all you

2:32:04.420 --> 2:32:07.700
 know uh official hundred dollar bills because as long as i have a hundred

2:32:07.700 --> 2:32:10.580
 dollars i have hundred dollars i don't need that exact same bill back

2:32:10.580 --> 2:32:13.300
 so that means that those hundred dollar bills are fungible

2:32:13.300 --> 2:32:17.540
 non fungible would be like art if i took a picasso and i put it down on the table

2:32:17.540 --> 2:32:20.180
 and you brought three artists that no one's ever heard of before and we mixed

2:32:20.180 --> 2:32:22.100
 them up and i just took any random piece of art

2:32:22.100 --> 2:32:25.060
 it wasn't the picasso i lose because the picasso is really

2:32:25.060 --> 2:32:28.500
 important there right so non fungibility is important in art

2:32:28.500 --> 2:32:32.740
 what these non fungible tokens essentially are doing is they are uh

2:32:32.740 --> 2:32:38.900
 creating scarcity and originality in a digital environment and what i mean by

2:32:38.900 --> 2:32:42.980
 that is um take a music file if i had a music

2:32:42.980 --> 2:32:45.140
 file and you wanted it you said send it to me

2:32:45.140 --> 2:32:49.380
 i press send it essentially creates a copy and you get one music file i get

2:32:49.380 --> 2:32:51.540
 another we don't care you can listen to music i

2:32:51.540 --> 2:32:57.220
 can listen to music we're super happy if i instead though have a digital file

2:32:57.220 --> 2:33:03.220
 that entire premise is based on scarcity and i hit send and you get a copy and i

2:33:03.220 --> 2:33:05.620
 keep the original or you get the original i get a copy

2:33:05.620 --> 2:33:11.700
 there's a problem and so ultimately what i think is playing out with nfts is

2:33:11.700 --> 2:33:15.220
 it's a technology regardless of where it plays out from

2:33:15.220 --> 2:33:19.620
 blockchains or uh what in communities or environments

2:33:19.620 --> 2:33:25.940
 that just brings true digital scarcity to the internet and so naturally what

2:33:25.940 --> 2:33:28.100
 people do they look at the legacy world and they

2:33:28.100 --> 2:33:30.420
 say well what's scarce there that has value

2:33:30.420 --> 2:33:33.780
 how do we bring that to the digital world so art is a perfect example right

2:33:33.780 --> 2:33:36.260
 and you know frankly last year i started to

2:33:36.260 --> 2:33:40.260
 look at this because it felt like this was going to be really really big

2:33:40.260 --> 2:33:45.860
 and the conclusion i came to was just as bitcoin is going to be bigger

2:33:45.860 --> 2:33:48.500
 than gold right the digital application of

2:33:48.500 --> 2:33:50.900
 something is going to be bigger than the analog application

2:33:50.900 --> 2:33:54.180
 the same thing's going to be true in art the digital art world is going to be

2:33:54.180 --> 2:33:57.620
 bigger than the traditional art world people think that sounds crazy at first

2:33:57.620 --> 2:34:01.540
 until you start to realize it's very very similar the art is more

2:34:01.540 --> 2:34:04.660
 portable it can be divisible right it's got a

2:34:04.660 --> 2:34:08.100
 larger demand market in terms of the internet rather than an auction right

2:34:08.100 --> 2:34:12.100
 all this kind of stuff when you display it it can have motion

2:34:12.100 --> 2:34:16.180
 and music and all of these aspects to it that are better than the traditional

2:34:16.180 --> 2:34:18.740
 art what the traditional art market has that

2:34:18.740 --> 2:34:23.780
 the digital art market has not had is the narrative narrative based world

2:34:23.780 --> 2:34:30.100
 scarcity kind of in digital sense and so what i think the entire world is

2:34:30.100 --> 2:34:33.380
 going through right now is an exploration of how do we use this

2:34:33.380 --> 2:34:38.100
 technology to create new things frankly

2:34:38.100 --> 2:34:40.420
 we're not going to be good at it for a while

2:34:40.420 --> 2:34:43.700
 and so the only place i've really focused on is

2:34:43.700 --> 2:34:50.100
 digital art itself and i've always been interested in art but i wasn't going to

2:34:50.100 --> 2:34:52.100
 go buy a painting and hang it on the wall

2:34:52.100 --> 2:34:55.700
 right in the sense of uh that's how i was going to store value

2:34:55.700 --> 2:34:59.380
 what i find fascinating though is that i now can take

2:34:59.380 --> 2:35:02.900
 that concept which most of the wealthiest people in the world

2:35:02.900 --> 2:35:06.420
 have a significant portion some you know some people have 20 percent in terms of

2:35:06.420 --> 2:35:10.660
 you know number of billionaires 20 percent of their wealth is in art

2:35:10.660 --> 2:35:13.940
 and you can bring to this digital realm which is much more um

2:35:13.940 --> 2:35:19.140
 kind of natural to a digital native and so the best way to describe the

2:35:19.140 --> 2:35:22.820
 importance is imagine a serial number being placed on

2:35:22.820 --> 2:35:26.100
 something take the eiffel tower the only eiffel

2:35:26.100 --> 2:35:30.900
 tower that has value is the first one every replica of it regardless of size

2:35:30.900 --> 2:35:33.780
 location you know who made it where they sent it

2:35:33.780 --> 2:35:38.260
 they have no value eiffel tower 001 is the most important

2:35:38.260 --> 2:35:41.220
 and so i think that's ultimately what we're starting to see here

2:35:41.220 --> 2:35:45.380
 and what we're looking at is probably one percent of what it's going to grow

2:35:45.380 --> 2:35:49.220
 into so you're you're bullish you're saying

2:35:49.220 --> 2:35:52.580
 it could grow into something for one percent it could grow into something

2:35:52.580 --> 2:35:55.220
 significant like all the kinds of different applications

2:35:55.220 --> 2:35:58.420
 strip away all the applications right now and just think about

2:35:58.420 --> 2:36:01.700
 is digital scarcity going to be important on the internet moving all the things

2:36:01.700 --> 2:36:04.260
 that are scarce in the physical world into digital space

2:36:04.260 --> 2:36:07.140
 us trying to figure out which things can be moved and not

2:36:07.140 --> 2:36:10.340
 and also there's things in the digital space just like you're saying that

2:36:10.340 --> 2:36:13.300
 don't exist in the physical world that might also

2:36:13.300 --> 2:36:18.020
 benefit from gaining scarcity like you know people are i guess creating

2:36:18.020 --> 2:36:21.700
 nfts out of like tweets or whatever so like you're you have you

2:36:21.700 --> 2:36:24.980
 have a fun twitter account you know you could say like you

2:36:24.980 --> 2:36:27.620
 could put value to a single tweet and then be

2:36:27.620 --> 2:36:31.460
 able to invest in it and trade it and buy parts of it and all those kinds of

2:36:31.460 --> 2:36:33.780
 things you know you can invest in people you

2:36:33.780 --> 2:36:38.820
 can invest in you know art can be defined broadly as

2:36:38.820 --> 2:36:42.340
 any kind of creation right and in some sense

2:36:42.340 --> 2:36:47.860
 this whole idea of scarcity can overtake the entirety

2:36:47.860 --> 2:36:52.820
 of the digital world it can like consume the

2:36:52.820 --> 2:36:56.660
 all of the markets we see as financial markets and just turn

2:36:56.660 --> 2:37:01.620
 everything into a market well so if i take you on like a i don't know

2:37:01.620 --> 2:37:06.900
 10 year fast forward yeah and i paint a picture of uh something today that seems

2:37:06.900 --> 2:37:09.780
 absolutely insane but there's early signs that people are

2:37:09.780 --> 2:37:12.580
 building this and let's just give them the benefit of the doubt that

2:37:12.580 --> 2:37:16.980
 some of the early iterations will work and some of or most of them won't

2:37:16.980 --> 2:37:21.860
 there's a world where you and i are participating in a digital economy

2:37:21.860 --> 2:37:26.340
 in a virtual world where uh whether it is a piece of art

2:37:26.340 --> 2:37:29.620
 it is a digital sculpture it is a digital

2:37:29.620 --> 2:37:36.340
 skin from a video game it is a digital good that we purchased somewhere online

2:37:36.340 --> 2:37:42.740
 and we bring it and we display it in a digital museum or a virtual museum

2:37:42.740 --> 2:37:46.260
 and so now all of a sudden you can charge people for entry

2:37:46.260 --> 2:37:50.420
 you can consign digital goods it's the replication of what happens in the

2:37:50.420 --> 2:37:53.860
 analog world now just in digital and when you do that

2:37:53.860 --> 2:37:58.020
 what you do is you take the addressable markets

2:37:58.020 --> 2:38:01.860
 of these assets or these mechanisms and they explode

2:38:01.860 --> 2:38:05.300
 in the digital realm and so now all of a sudden

2:38:05.300 --> 2:38:10.500
 how fast does the human race accelerate when it comes to human

2:38:10.500 --> 2:38:14.500
 production intelligence learning all in the digital

2:38:14.500 --> 2:38:19.540
 output it's just if i said to you 20 years ago i'm going to give you a

2:38:19.540 --> 2:38:22.900
 global education that means i'm going to take you and i'm

2:38:22.900 --> 2:38:26.820
 going to physically move you to geography after geography after

2:38:26.820 --> 2:38:29.060
 geography it's going to take time it's going to

2:38:29.060 --> 2:38:32.820
 take resources and ultimately it's going to take lots of effort

2:38:32.820 --> 2:38:36.020
 if i now said to you hey i'm going to transport you

2:38:36.020 --> 2:38:40.260
 in this virtual world to multiple geographies

2:38:40.260 --> 2:38:44.500
 but you're going to experience it in this virtual

2:38:44.500 --> 2:38:47.780
 world and you're going to have digital goods that you can take

2:38:47.780 --> 2:38:52.420
 from economy to economy or from location to location

2:38:52.420 --> 2:38:55.540
 all of a sudden you may get maybe you get 90 of the value you don't get 100

2:38:55.540 --> 2:38:58.980
 of the same value we get 90 of the value but you can

2:38:58.980 --> 2:39:02.580
 do it at a much faster pace and so in the six month period

2:39:02.580 --> 2:39:05.620
 you've actually made three times the progress

2:39:05.620 --> 2:39:09.140
 than you would have if you had to do in the physical world so that's where i

2:39:09.140 --> 2:39:13.460
 think we're heading so there's digital art being displayed

2:39:13.460 --> 2:39:17.940
 in the digital museum and people are being charged for access

2:39:17.940 --> 2:39:22.020
 and perhaps we plug in our senses which means we start to operate more and more

2:39:22.020 --> 2:39:25.540
 in a virtual reality augmented reality virtual reality way

2:39:25.540 --> 2:39:29.860
 with this digital world and increasingly going to this world

2:39:29.860 --> 2:39:33.700
 basically lived most of our productive and uh

2:39:33.700 --> 2:39:39.540
 social lives in this digital world uh and increasingly essentially create a

2:39:39.540 --> 2:39:44.420
 simulation where the biological basis is just there

2:39:44.420 --> 2:39:49.300
 to say sustain the brain that's used to operate in the in the virtual world

2:39:49.300 --> 2:39:53.380
 uh taking us back to the original when we started talking about war

2:39:53.380 --> 2:39:57.460
 i wonder what conflict looks like in that world

2:39:57.460 --> 2:40:02.180
 that uh the people who are born today maybe will be fighting wars

2:40:02.180 --> 2:40:07.700
 in the space in in that museum world in that digital world remember what i said

2:40:07.700 --> 2:40:11.300
 we're moving from a world of conflict surrounded

2:40:11.300 --> 2:40:14.820
 and determined by bombs bullets and soldiers

2:40:14.820 --> 2:40:19.300
 to a battlefield that is determined by war of information

2:40:19.300 --> 2:40:24.340
 and cyber capabilities and so in that virtual world

2:40:24.340 --> 2:40:31.300
 is it about death and destruction of human life in the physical analog world

2:40:31.300 --> 2:40:35.780
 or will it become more important to attack or defend

2:40:35.780 --> 2:40:40.420
 virtual property and virtual life and you know some level of virtual

2:40:40.420 --> 2:40:45.620
 sovereignty in my opinion the latter is more likely

2:40:45.620 --> 2:40:48.980
 and so what you start to understand is well

2:40:48.980 --> 2:40:55.220
 what do you truly value in your life is it the physical analog materialistic

2:40:55.220 --> 2:41:00.340
 consumptive goods or is it virtual

2:41:00.340 --> 2:41:05.540
 and in many cases something as simple as the ability to connect

2:41:05.540 --> 2:41:10.420
 with somebody it's really important and so one of the most disruptive

2:41:10.420 --> 2:41:15.060
 combative violent things that a country may do to another country in the future

2:41:15.060 --> 2:41:18.180
 simply take down the internet

2:41:18.580 --> 2:41:23.220
 and put people in isolation yeah i don't need to physically harm you if i can

2:41:23.220 --> 2:41:27.620
 psychologically harm you i don't need to it's terrifying yeah i

2:41:27.620 --> 2:41:32.580
 don't need to uh actually convince you

2:41:32.580 --> 2:41:36.260
 through a monopoly on violence on physical violence

2:41:36.260 --> 2:41:39.620
 what if i can psychologically change the way you see the world

2:41:39.620 --> 2:41:42.900
 through misinformation through all sorts of

2:41:42.900 --> 2:41:46.180
 nefarious activities and i think that you know the united states has been

2:41:46.180 --> 2:41:49.780
 struggling with this idea over the last couple of years in the political arena

2:41:49.780 --> 2:41:54.340
 but what happens when it starts to come to other aspects of our life

2:41:54.340 --> 2:41:58.740
 and i think it's very likely it's almost obviously likely that we're moving into

2:41:58.740 --> 2:42:01.620
 the digital world

2:42:01.620 --> 2:42:05.300
 the one of the features of the digital world

2:42:05.300 --> 2:42:11.220
 is that artificial intelligence systems can operate with much more power in a

2:42:11.220 --> 2:42:16.180
 in a frictionless way in that world currently as we understand it it's hard

2:42:16.180 --> 2:42:20.340
 it's hard to build robots that operate at scale and do like

2:42:20.340 --> 2:42:24.340
 arbitrary large amount of impact damage or positive

2:42:24.340 --> 2:42:28.740
 in the physical world it's much easier to do in the digital world

2:42:28.740 --> 2:42:31.780
 do you have do you ever think about ai systems

2:42:31.780 --> 2:42:38.420
 just swimming about uh doing extraordinarily powerful destructive

2:42:38.420 --> 2:42:42.340
 things in the digital world is that something of a concern to you

2:42:42.340 --> 2:42:46.020
 or is this something into a very distant future

2:42:46.020 --> 2:42:49.460
 i think a lot of artificial intelligence is

2:42:49.460 --> 2:42:54.660
 uh in the name it's simply the replication of human intelligence

2:42:54.660 --> 2:43:00.820
 at scale automated and program uh programmatic meaning

2:43:00.820 --> 2:43:04.660
 that in the analog world you could go hire a

2:43:04.660 --> 2:43:07.700
 thousand employees or in you know an amazon case hire

2:43:07.700 --> 2:43:12.420
 millions of employees and set a mission or a goal and push

2:43:12.420 --> 2:43:16.740
 them to go do that that requires recruiting retention

2:43:16.740 --> 2:43:22.580
 training resources all that stuff in the virtual world or in this digital

2:43:22.580 --> 2:43:26.180
 economy what if you can just program the resources

2:43:26.180 --> 2:43:30.500
 and gain the same leverage and do it at scale and do it in a very

2:43:30.500 --> 2:43:35.540
 programmatic way and then have them actually make decisions

2:43:35.540 --> 2:43:39.860
 in a way that doesn't require you to have thought of every single

2:43:39.860 --> 2:43:43.780
 potential scenario or edge case that's ultimately what we're talking about when

2:43:43.780 --> 2:43:45.780
 we talk about artificial intelligence right

2:43:45.780 --> 2:43:49.620
 and so when you look at that when technology is created

2:43:49.620 --> 2:43:53.460
 everyone uses it for good or bad but both get used

2:43:53.460 --> 2:43:57.300
 right and so whether we're talking about cell phones beepers the internet

2:43:57.300 --> 2:44:01.700
 uh guns whatever it's always used for good and bad

2:44:01.700 --> 2:44:05.060
 the big question is and i think that you know yourself and many other people have

2:44:05.060 --> 2:44:10.020
 rightfully said this is the question really becomes

2:44:10.020 --> 2:44:16.740
 is the negative and nefarious uses of this inadvertent potentially

2:44:16.740 --> 2:44:20.260
 or does it actually come from a malicious person it's the intention

2:44:20.260 --> 2:44:22.980
 malicious and to me that's what i i don't know

2:44:22.980 --> 2:44:25.620
 enough you know much more about this and there's plenty of other people who do as

2:44:25.620 --> 2:44:29.860
 well but i do think that there will be

2:44:29.860 --> 2:44:34.180
 nefarious actors and malicious people but we're going to treat them the same

2:44:34.180 --> 2:44:38.260
 way we've always treated people who use technology poorly right we're going to

2:44:38.260 --> 2:44:40.740
 understand it we're going to identify it we're going to control it and then we're

2:44:40.740 --> 2:44:44.420
 going to end up reversing it or preventing that from doing them it's the

2:44:44.420 --> 2:44:47.620
 inadvertent things that i think are actually the most dangerous

2:44:47.620 --> 2:44:51.700
 because when you have something that can think for itself

2:44:51.700 --> 2:44:56.020
 and there is no way to leverage a monopoly on violence

2:44:56.020 --> 2:45:02.020
 for control it's a very scary thing and it can i mean the the thing that's

2:45:02.020 --> 2:45:06.260
 scary to me is this it can scale arbitrarily so it can outnumber humans

2:45:06.260 --> 2:45:12.420
 very quickly even if it's dumber than humans and so

2:45:12.420 --> 2:45:16.820
 i don't know if we're able to reason about a world

2:45:16.820 --> 2:45:21.460
 like let's look at the physical analog where all of a sudden

2:45:21.460 --> 2:45:26.020
 uh let's talk about something kind of like humans but dumber than humans like

2:45:26.020 --> 2:45:30.020
 chimps okay imagine that all of a sudden chimps

2:45:30.020 --> 2:45:35.140
 could multiply arbitrarily quickly and you could have

2:45:35.140 --> 2:45:39.300
 like a trillion chimps the next day when you

2:45:39.300 --> 2:45:42.500
 when you only had maybe a million the day before

2:45:42.500 --> 2:45:46.980
 like how does that world look different where the fuck all these chimps come

2:45:46.980 --> 2:45:50.100
 from and they like and then we can we can

2:45:50.100 --> 2:45:54.660
 pretend to be like well let's hope the chimps like don't get violent because

2:45:54.660 --> 2:45:59.380
 they don't seem to get violent when the resources aren't constrained

2:45:59.380 --> 2:46:02.340
 but like we don't know and the problem is

2:46:02.340 --> 2:46:07.060
 it all starts by building that first chip multiplier

2:46:07.060 --> 2:46:10.660
 device and everyone's like okay yeah there's a lot of good applications you

2:46:10.660 --> 2:46:14.580
 want you know uh you can make all kinds of

2:46:14.580 --> 2:46:19.060
 arguments for why you have more chimps maybe they can help you out around the

2:46:19.060 --> 2:46:23.540
 house or something like that in the physical space uh but

2:46:23.540 --> 2:46:27.220
 ultimately it's the unintended consequences that you're referring to is

2:46:27.220 --> 2:46:31.460
 you don't know what's going to happen i'm really worried about

2:46:31.460 --> 2:46:38.740
 dumb ai agents uh like having impact when they're multiplied

2:46:38.740 --> 2:46:44.660
 to a million to a billion and are allowed to operate in the digital space

2:46:44.660 --> 2:46:48.100
 especially as we clearly are moving more and more

2:46:48.100 --> 2:46:54.020
 of our lives into the digital space so it's kind of terrifying because we you

2:46:54.020 --> 2:46:57.860
 know a lot of people are terrified or like concerned about super

2:46:57.860 --> 2:47:02.020
 intelligence systems i think i'm definitely much more

2:47:02.020 --> 2:47:06.180
 concerned about super dumb systems at scale that

2:47:06.180 --> 2:47:09.860
 that's terrifying i always think about um the inadvertent

2:47:09.860 --> 2:47:12.340
 but as you were talking what it made me think of is

2:47:12.340 --> 2:47:16.580
 also the irreversible irreversible that's right so it's one thing if there's

2:47:16.580 --> 2:47:20.500
 your inadvertent negative impact but we have

2:47:20.500 --> 2:47:24.980
 reversibility built into a system and we can fix our mistakes yeah i think

2:47:24.980 --> 2:47:28.820
 the really scary part is when you overlay inadvertent mistakes with the

2:47:28.820 --> 2:47:34.020
 irreversible aspect of it and therefore humans have no control

2:47:34.020 --> 2:47:38.180
 yeah if you if you have the trillion chimps you can't

2:47:38.180 --> 2:47:43.140
 they're not gonna like it when you try to start killing them off

2:47:44.020 --> 2:47:51.460
 uh all right but back to bitcoin those chimps in the bitcoin community

2:47:51.460 --> 2:47:55.540
 anytime you bring up chimps some people say joe rogan entered the chat

2:47:55.540 --> 2:48:00.180
 can i ask you about sort of learning about bitcoin books and resources you

2:48:00.180 --> 2:48:04.100
 have an amazing podcast that's not just about

2:48:04.100 --> 2:48:08.100
 bitcoin or cryptocurrency it's about everything including life but you do

2:48:08.100 --> 2:48:12.420
 have a lot of really amazing conversations about this whole

2:48:12.420 --> 2:48:17.300
 digital world but you obviously you also have a newsletter

2:48:17.300 --> 2:48:23.780
 that's incredible on substack and and um

2:48:23.780 --> 2:48:27.380
 but do you have recommendations maybe it would be great if you could talk about

2:48:27.380 --> 2:48:31.860
 first of all your podcast and the newsletter but also other

2:48:31.860 --> 2:48:35.220
 resources that you recommend people should check out in order to learn

2:48:35.220 --> 2:48:40.820
 about bitcoin yeah so the podcast and uh email are like the two most selfish

2:48:40.820 --> 2:48:43.620
 things i do because the podcast is a way for me to

2:48:43.620 --> 2:48:46.740
 learn from other people so i get them to come on and tell me all

2:48:46.740 --> 2:48:49.380
 the things they're thinking about and i could ask some questions what's it

2:48:49.380 --> 2:48:52.100
 called by the way uh just the pomp podcast

2:48:52.100 --> 2:48:57.940
 and so in doing that um it really is informative for me and i think that my

2:48:57.940 --> 2:49:00.900
 whole goal is just like if i'm learning other people will be learning

2:49:00.900 --> 2:49:05.220
 and then the email uh i read it every morning because it forces me to

2:49:05.220 --> 2:49:08.420
 collect my thoughts and actually articulate them in somewhat of a

2:49:08.420 --> 2:49:12.180
 coherent way and so it's just something that um is

2:49:12.180 --> 2:49:14.740
 like a practice that i probably would do even if no one read it

2:49:14.740 --> 2:49:19.380
 and then by being able to publish it uh what does it do it elicits you know

2:49:19.380 --> 2:49:22.100
 both the good and bad responses and so people will let me know if they think

2:49:22.100 --> 2:49:24.740
 i'm an idiot and they'll usually not respond if they think that

2:49:24.740 --> 2:49:29.140
 it's something smart and so um those two things are really um

2:49:29.140 --> 2:49:32.740
 educational for me and i think kind of forced me to uh to be able to

2:49:32.740 --> 2:49:36.580
 articulate a lot of ideas but a lot of what i share or learn on

2:49:36.580 --> 2:49:38.660
 those things come from these other resources

2:49:38.660 --> 2:49:41.780
 so i'm definitely subscribing people should subscribe but

2:49:41.780 --> 2:49:45.860
 what are bitcoin resources books that you recommend

2:49:45.860 --> 2:49:49.460
 i think you got to start with bitcoin standard uh that one to me feels like

2:49:49.460 --> 2:49:52.740
 uh it really lays out the picture nicely um

2:49:52.740 --> 2:49:56.340
 there is uh bitcoin uh money you can't fuck with

2:49:56.340 --> 2:49:59.700
 i was written by our friend jason williams uh as you can imagine it's

2:49:59.700 --> 2:50:03.140
 basically what it talks about uh there's another book layered money

2:50:03.140 --> 2:50:06.820
 um it's written by nick who uh who's done a great uh great job

2:50:06.820 --> 2:50:10.900
 kind of laying it out um there's a book uh called bitcoin in black america

2:50:10.900 --> 2:50:14.980
 written by a guy isaiah jackson and he basically lays out the argument for

2:50:14.980 --> 2:50:18.820
 why the black community um can benefit in a

2:50:18.820 --> 2:50:22.260
 asymmetric way from something like bitcoin um and there's a whole bunch

2:50:22.260 --> 2:50:25.700
 more i'm gonna forget them all um there's the uh i think it's called the

2:50:25.700 --> 2:50:30.260
 cost of tomorrow a guy jeff booth uh jeff booth wrote it

2:50:30.260 --> 2:50:33.220
 um and just if you get on twitter basically you're gonna see all these

2:50:33.220 --> 2:50:38.260
 books flying around um but i do have to say that uh from a

2:50:38.260 --> 2:50:41.860
 psychological concept uh or philosophical

2:50:41.860 --> 2:50:45.860
 concept the number one book that i've ever read uh that aligns with bitcoin

2:50:45.860 --> 2:50:47.780
 ethos but doesn't say a word about bitcoin

2:50:47.780 --> 2:50:51.220
 is a book called the dow of capital by mark spitznagel

2:50:51.220 --> 2:50:55.220
 and so what he essentially does is he just reiterates over and over and over

2:50:55.220 --> 2:50:59.300
 again long term thinking outliers disruption

2:50:59.300 --> 2:51:02.340
 all the stuff and so he's a guy who he runs a fund

2:51:02.340 --> 2:51:05.940
 uh that essentially they just do uh tail risk hedging

2:51:05.940 --> 2:51:09.700
 and so in you know march or february of 2020

2:51:09.700 --> 2:51:13.220
 they're up like four thousand percent right

2:51:13.220 --> 2:51:16.260
 by the way they pretty much lose money you know

2:51:16.260 --> 2:51:18.980
 for eight nine years then that happens and so

2:51:18.980 --> 2:51:22.660
 uh but they're still one of the best performing funds if you look at it over

2:51:22.660 --> 2:51:25.700
 you know years and years and so it's just this mindset of

2:51:25.700 --> 2:51:29.380
 uh everyone is so short term focused and so i think it's just a great reminder

2:51:29.380 --> 2:51:34.420
 to long term thinking uh and also i mean i've gotten quite a

2:51:34.420 --> 2:51:37.220
 bit of value just reading the papers and that's perhaps more

2:51:37.220 --> 2:51:40.980
 like for technical folks there's quite an active research community

2:51:40.980 --> 2:51:44.260
 and also going back to the original white paper and just

2:51:44.260 --> 2:51:48.100
 original documents old school old school is still

2:51:48.100 --> 2:51:52.100
 what uh like what a few years ago still really interesting

2:51:52.100 --> 2:51:56.900
 to think about to look at what people were thinking about

2:51:56.900 --> 2:52:00.500
 because the the principles are carried through

2:52:00.500 --> 2:52:04.020
 with uh other cryptocurrencies as well like it's it's all

2:52:04.020 --> 2:52:07.300
 it's all there even in the early documents so

2:52:07.300 --> 2:52:10.660
 that's kind of fascinating to see that whole history from if you're more

2:52:10.660 --> 2:52:14.420
 like tech savvy and like you said twitter is actually an interesting place

2:52:14.420 --> 2:52:17.940
 if you can look past all the shit coin talk

2:52:17.940 --> 2:52:21.620
 it's a it's a fascinating place for news and resources

2:52:21.620 --> 2:52:24.980
 is there books outside of all this cryptocurrency sort of

2:52:24.980 --> 2:52:29.060
 technical fiction philosophical that impact on your life

2:52:29.060 --> 2:52:32.420
 because you've you have interests that are all over the place is there

2:52:32.420 --> 2:52:36.500
 something that um you would recommend to others so

2:52:36.500 --> 2:52:39.060
 doubt capital is definitely probably my favorite book

2:52:39.060 --> 2:52:43.940
 um books that have been impactful i read uh when i was 20 actually sitting in the

2:52:43.940 --> 2:52:47.540
 desert of iraq um rich dad poor dad thinking grow rich

2:52:47.540 --> 2:52:51.940
 and the richest man in babble on and i don't think i took a single thing

2:52:51.940 --> 2:52:54.260
 and like implemented it from like an execution

2:52:54.260 --> 2:52:59.060
 standpoint uh but it was a complete shift in mentality

2:52:59.060 --> 2:53:02.340
 and understanding a relationship with money and um

2:53:02.340 --> 2:53:05.140
 just kind of what i wanted to do with my life and stuff like that so i think

2:53:05.140 --> 2:53:07.300
 those three books i read them in succession

2:53:07.300 --> 2:53:11.060
 were really impactful um and then i think one of the best books probably

2:53:11.060 --> 2:53:14.340
 ever written is uh i think it's called uh when breath becomes air

2:53:14.340 --> 2:53:18.340
 um or air becomes breath i can't remember uh but it's basically a

2:53:18.340 --> 2:53:21.460
 doctor or a medical professional who's dying

2:53:21.460 --> 2:53:26.020
 and he essentially writes about the experience and thoughts and kind of all

2:53:26.020 --> 2:53:29.620
 the stuff and i think that it's just uh one of these

2:53:29.620 --> 2:53:32.660
 things where if you said to me you know what's the number one thing i took out

2:53:32.660 --> 2:53:37.220
 of my experience in iraq that's a book like that also gives you is

2:53:37.220 --> 2:53:40.100
 we're all gonna die right and you and i can want to be as

2:53:40.100 --> 2:53:42.660
 immortal as we want but at some point we're gonna die

2:53:42.660 --> 2:53:45.860
 and so it really does kind of focus you on

2:53:45.860 --> 2:53:49.540
 time being that scarce asset and use it for

2:53:49.540 --> 2:53:53.300
 enjoyment and happiness uh more so than anything else and i think that's part of

2:53:53.300 --> 2:53:58.020
 your message and it's a great one do you think do you like literally

2:53:58.020 --> 2:54:02.660
 meditate on your own mortality i necessarily think i uh meditate on it

2:54:02.660 --> 2:54:06.420
 as much as um are you afraid of death were you afraid of

2:54:06.420 --> 2:54:09.380
 death when you're in iraq i mean if you're coming face to face with it

2:54:09.380 --> 2:54:12.740
 are you afraid of death today no i i think that it was just one of these

2:54:12.740 --> 2:54:16.820
 things where like if you fixate on something and you

2:54:16.820 --> 2:54:21.700
 worry about it then at least to me like you become

2:54:21.700 --> 2:54:28.020
 uneasy about it and so after an experience like going to war

2:54:28.020 --> 2:54:32.180
 i think that everything is just so not important compared to that

2:54:32.180 --> 2:54:35.620
 right like when i came back i remember uh going back into

2:54:35.620 --> 2:54:39.300
 the college environment and like things people worried about i was like

2:54:39.300 --> 2:54:43.860
 listen let me explain to you you know what the real world is like right

2:54:43.860 --> 2:54:47.300
 but i think even today right if you talk to people who know me really well

2:54:47.300 --> 2:54:50.660
 i don't get worked up about a lot of stuff i don't get you know in either

2:54:50.660 --> 2:54:53.780
 direction good or bad uh anything because ultimately it just

2:54:53.780 --> 2:54:58.100
 comes down to if that's the final result

2:54:58.100 --> 2:55:01.380
 let's enjoy it it's fascinating to ask you

2:55:01.380 --> 2:55:08.180
 because this reformulation of money essentially buying time

2:55:08.180 --> 2:55:16.100
 and uh you know there's the old question of does money buy happiness

2:55:16.100 --> 2:55:22.580
 do you think money can buy happiness in the context of money being able to buy

2:55:22.580 --> 2:55:26.500
 time or is happiness something else that is

2:55:26.500 --> 2:55:30.900
 beyond all of this when people talk about this question i

2:55:30.900 --> 2:55:36.100
 think that they really focus on money as a means to getting materialistic

2:55:36.100 --> 2:55:40.420
 things so they want a big house they want a boat they want a fast car they

2:55:40.420 --> 2:55:44.020
 want you know whatever they think that's the stuff that will

2:55:44.020 --> 2:55:48.100
 make them happy what i think about it is if you have

2:55:48.100 --> 2:55:51.620
 resources you can have time and if you have time and

2:55:51.620 --> 2:55:54.980
 you spend it the way that you want to spend it then that's ultimately

2:55:54.980 --> 2:55:57.620
 happiness so i always say to people if you think that money doesn't

2:55:57.620 --> 2:56:01.220
 buy you happiness what if i told you that if you had more money you could

2:56:01.220 --> 2:56:06.180
 spend more time with your family it reframes it yeah and now is all

2:56:06.180 --> 2:56:09.460
 about i want to do certain things in life but

2:56:09.460 --> 2:56:11.620
 there's a lot of people who spend their life

2:56:11.620 --> 2:56:16.580
 not doing those things because they feel the need to pursue economic

2:56:16.580 --> 2:56:20.900
 means as a way to provide a living or

2:56:20.900 --> 2:56:24.900
 whatever and so i explain this listen in my opinion again it's my opinion it's

2:56:24.900 --> 2:56:29.220
 what makes me happy if i can leverage financial resources to

2:56:29.220 --> 2:56:34.180
 create more time to do the things i like i'm happier

2:56:34.180 --> 2:56:37.140
 might not work for everybody but like that's what works for me and so there's

2:56:37.140 --> 2:56:39.780
 this element of like i don't care what other people think if

2:56:39.780 --> 2:56:43.540
 they like that or not because they're not me right like there's

2:56:43.540 --> 2:56:46.020
 almost this element of like you gotta figure out what works for you and if it

2:56:46.020 --> 2:56:50.260
 works for me then like no i think that resonate that that will

2:56:50.260 --> 2:56:53.620
 resonate with a lot of people i think that's a brilliant reframing of it

2:56:53.620 --> 2:56:57.700
 uh that said uh you kind of imply there's a

2:56:57.700 --> 2:57:01.860
 there's a reason behind this whole existence of ours there's a meaning to it

2:57:01.860 --> 2:57:04.980
 so let me ask what is the meaning of life

2:57:04.980 --> 2:57:09.300
 anthony do you think about these ridiculous big questions

2:57:09.300 --> 2:57:12.740
 that have no answer every once in a while or do you just enjoy the shit out

2:57:12.740 --> 2:57:17.380
 of every day i answer it in a way that um isn't meant

2:57:17.380 --> 2:57:22.420
 to be accurate it's meant to um

2:57:22.420 --> 2:57:26.580
 be the right answer for me which is ultimately you know and i talk to a lot

2:57:26.580 --> 2:57:29.620
 of people who always ask like what's the what are you doing why are you doing this

2:57:29.620 --> 2:57:34.180
 i say it's to be happy and the reason why i think of it that

2:57:34.180 --> 2:57:37.700
 way is i've got a friend jonathan galler who talks about uh

2:57:37.700 --> 2:57:41.540
 you know enough being enough and recently he talked about it in the

2:57:41.540 --> 2:57:45.300
 um context of bitcoin and so bitcoiners are have two things any

2:57:45.300 --> 2:57:47.700
 bitcoiner if you talk to them they believe the same two things one

2:57:47.700 --> 2:57:50.580
 they don't want the us dollar price to go up because they actually want to

2:57:50.580 --> 2:57:53.540
 acquire more bitcoin right and then let it go once they feel like they've got

2:57:53.540 --> 2:57:56.580
 enough but two is no matter how much they own they think that they don't own

2:57:56.580 --> 2:58:02.660
 enough and they want to acquire more and so at some point you say to yourself

2:58:02.660 --> 2:58:06.660
 what is enough and and i think that the whole meaning of life

2:58:06.660 --> 2:58:12.500
 is to understand kind of what your level of satisfaction is and for

2:58:12.500 --> 2:58:15.860
 some people that's a monetary thing some people that's a freedom of time thing

2:58:15.860 --> 2:58:18.820
 for some people it's an impact thing whatever but just

2:58:18.820 --> 2:58:22.420
 understanding that's important and then going and accomplishing it

2:58:22.420 --> 2:58:26.500
 and what i've found is that the people who i know who have done this and been

2:58:26.500 --> 2:58:29.300
 intentional about it they accomplish it on a much shorter

2:58:29.300 --> 2:58:31.940
 timeline than people who don't right there's some people who start thinking

2:58:31.940 --> 2:58:34.980
 about this when they're 60 naturally you're not going to accomplish

2:58:34.980 --> 2:58:37.540
 before you're 60 if you just start thinking about it 60

2:58:37.540 --> 2:58:40.260
 people who are thinking about it earlier can do it and so i think that's really

2:58:40.260 --> 2:58:43.140
 it for me it's just like the meaning of life is to enjoy it

2:58:43.140 --> 2:58:46.660
 the way i think about it that's because it's a really nice formulation i i

2:58:46.660 --> 2:58:49.140
 almost like to sort of oscillate back and forth so

2:58:49.140 --> 2:58:54.100
 majority of the time is spent at the moment of enough is enough

2:58:54.100 --> 2:58:59.060
 of gratitude of basically being content with where you're at like deeply

2:58:59.060 --> 2:59:03.380
 appreciative of every moment and all the bitcoin whatever bitcoin you

2:59:03.380 --> 2:59:07.460
 have being deeply appreciative of it and that being enough and then some

2:59:07.460 --> 2:59:10.980
 fraction of time perhaps it shrinks as you get older that's

2:59:10.980 --> 2:59:13.460
 maybe there's an optimal trajectory there but

2:59:13.460 --> 2:59:18.020
 some fraction of time is spent being yeah like deeply self critical

2:59:18.020 --> 2:59:22.180
 and nothing is enough nothing you've ever done is worth anything it's the

2:59:22.180 --> 2:59:25.540
 marvin minsky said like the secret to success

2:59:25.540 --> 2:59:29.940
 is hating everything you've ever done so like that mode of just hating

2:59:29.940 --> 2:59:33.620
 everything you've ever done and just like trying to improve trying to make

2:59:33.620 --> 2:59:37.380
 stuff better nothing is enough it's never enough that

2:59:37.380 --> 2:59:39.860
 kind of stuff and then oscillating back and forth like

2:59:39.860 --> 2:59:42.820
 you don't have to have the same algorithm operating throughout the day

2:59:42.820 --> 2:59:44.980
 you could just like oscillate back and forth

2:59:44.980 --> 2:59:50.020
 and maybe reserve that gratitude part the chill part to when you're hanging

2:59:50.020 --> 2:59:52.180
 out with family and friends and loved ones

2:59:52.180 --> 2:59:55.540
 and then when you're like alone or maybe at work

2:59:55.540 --> 2:59:59.620
 that's the madman comes out kind of thing i also think it's um

2:59:59.620 --> 3:00:03.620
 kind of purpose driven in the sense of there's a lot of people who have the

3:00:03.620 --> 3:00:08.340
 uh i need to do more but in a somewhat altruistic way

3:00:08.340 --> 3:00:11.780
 so they're you know take elon as an example

3:00:11.780 --> 3:00:18.180
 the idea of colonizing mars sure if he is successful he will be very

3:00:18.180 --> 3:00:20.420
 rich i don't think you or i or many people

3:00:20.420 --> 3:00:23.300
 believe he's doing it for the money right there's a lot of other things he

3:00:23.300 --> 3:00:26.820
 could do that would be much easier that would make him tons of money

3:00:26.820 --> 3:00:33.700
 and so in some weird way he has enough because he's able to free himself from

3:00:33.700 --> 3:00:37.620
 the constraints of i need to acquire more resources

3:00:37.620 --> 3:00:40.420
 and he can focus on what is the thing that i want to work on regardless of

3:00:40.420 --> 3:00:44.660
 money and so in that pursuit that is

3:00:44.660 --> 3:00:47.780
 non economic you can be as selfish as you want

3:00:47.780 --> 3:00:50.980
 because ultimately you're not tied back to

3:00:50.980 --> 3:00:54.260
 this like measurement tool and so it's this

3:00:54.260 --> 3:00:59.540
 uh again like altruistic non monetary purpose and i think that there's a lot

3:00:59.540 --> 3:01:01.380
 of people who spend their whole life looking for that and they don't know

3:01:01.380 --> 3:01:05.620
 what it is and so again some people may not think

3:01:05.620 --> 3:01:09.060
 of it that way but if you can find something to do that

3:01:09.060 --> 3:01:13.620
 you win i don't think there's a better way to end it anthony i'm a huge fan

3:01:13.620 --> 3:01:16.740
