00:00.000 --> 00:03.800
 The following is a conversation with Dan Carlin,

00:03.800 --> 00:08.760
 host of Hardcore History and Common Sense Podcasts.

00:08.760 --> 00:11.680
 To me, Hardcore History is one of,

00:11.680 --> 00:15.960
 if not the greatest podcast ever made.

00:15.960 --> 00:19.240
 Dan and Joe Rogan are probably the two main people

00:19.240 --> 00:22.880
 who got me to fall in love with the medium of podcasting

00:22.880 --> 00:27.400
 as a fan and eventually as a podcaster myself.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.960
 Meeting Dan was surreal.

00:29.960 --> 00:33.400
 To me, he was not just a mere human like the rest of us,

00:33.400 --> 00:36.000
 since his voice has been a guide

00:36.000 --> 00:37.680
 through some of the darkest moments

00:37.680 --> 00:39.480
 of human history for me.

00:39.480 --> 00:42.120
 Meeting him was like meeting Genghis Khan,

00:42.120 --> 00:45.200
 Stalin, Hitler, Alexander the Great,

00:45.200 --> 00:48.460
 and all of the most powerful leaders in history all at once

00:48.460 --> 00:51.880
 in a crappy hotel room in the middle of Oregon.

00:51.880 --> 00:55.880
 It turns out that he is in fact just a human

00:55.880 --> 00:58.720
 and truly one of the good ones.

00:58.720 --> 01:01.440
 This was a pleasure and an honor for me.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.280
 Quick mention of each sponsor,

01:04.280 --> 01:07.360
 followed by some thoughts related to the episode.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.080
 First is Athletic Greens,

01:09.080 --> 01:11.720
 the all in one drink that I start every day with

01:11.720 --> 01:14.160
 to cover all my nutritional bases.

01:14.160 --> 01:16.080
 Second is SimpliSafe,

01:16.080 --> 01:18.260
 a home security company I use to monitor

01:18.260 --> 01:20.240
 and protect my apartment.

01:20.240 --> 01:22.160
 Third is Magic Spoon,

01:22.160 --> 01:26.440
 low carb, keto friendly cereal that I think is delicious.

01:26.440 --> 01:27.860
 And finally, Cash App,

01:27.860 --> 01:31.360
 the app I use to send money to friends for food and drinks.

01:31.360 --> 01:33.640
 Please check out these sponsors in the description

01:33.640 --> 01:36.800
 to get a discount and to support this podcast.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.120
 As a side note, let me say that I think

01:40.120 --> 01:42.680
 we're living through one of the most challenging moments

01:42.680 --> 01:44.720
 in American history.

01:44.720 --> 01:49.040
 To me, the way out is through reason and love.

01:49.040 --> 01:52.100
 Both require a deep understanding of human nature

01:52.100 --> 01:54.180
 and of human history.

01:54.180 --> 01:56.720
 This conversation is about both.

01:56.720 --> 02:01.720
 I am, perhaps hopelessly, optimistic about our future.

02:01.760 --> 02:05.280
 But, if indeed we stand at the precipice

02:05.280 --> 02:09.600
 of the great filter, watching our world consumed by fire,

02:09.600 --> 02:12.360
 think of this little podcast conversation

02:12.360 --> 02:16.920
 as the appetizer to the final meal before the apocalypse.

02:17.920 --> 02:20.480

02:28.800 --> 02:32.720
 And now, finally, here's my conversation

02:32.720 --> 02:35.200
 with the great Dan Carlin.

02:36.320 --> 02:39.080
 Let's start with the highest philosophical question.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.860
 Do you think human beings are fundamentally good,

02:41.860 --> 02:46.680
 or are all of us capable of both good and evil,

02:46.680 --> 02:50.920
 and it's the environment that molds how we,

02:50.920 --> 02:53.520
 the trajectory that we take through life?

02:53.520 --> 02:55.680
 How do we define evil?

02:55.680 --> 02:57.960
 Evil seems to be a situational

02:57.960 --> 03:00.600
 eye of the beholder kind of question.

03:00.600 --> 03:04.880
 So, if we define evil, maybe I can get a better idea of,

03:04.880 --> 03:08.280
 and that could be a whole show, couldn't it, defining evil.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.720
 But when we say evil, what do we mean?

03:10.720 --> 03:13.800
 That's a slippery one, but I think there's some way

03:13.800 --> 03:17.620
 in which your existence, your presence in the world,

03:17.620 --> 03:22.300
 leads to pain and suffering and destruction

03:22.300 --> 03:25.000
 for many others in the rest of the world.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.800
 So, you steal the resources and you use them

03:28.800 --> 03:33.800
 to create more suffering than there was before in the world.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.920
 So, I suppose it's somehow deeply connected

03:35.920 --> 03:39.360
 to this other slippery word, which is suffering.

03:39.360 --> 03:41.780
 As you create suffering in the world,

03:41.780 --> 03:43.600
 you bring suffering to the world.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.160
 But here's the problem, I think, with it,

03:45.160 --> 03:47.000
 because I fully see where you're going with that,

03:47.000 --> 03:48.480
 and I understand it.

03:48.480 --> 03:52.520
 The problem is the question of the reason

03:52.520 --> 03:54.200
 for inflicting suffering.

03:54.200 --> 03:58.080
 So, sometimes one might inflict suffering

03:58.080 --> 04:00.800
 upon one group of individuals

04:00.800 --> 04:04.360
 in order to maximize a lack of suffering

04:04.360 --> 04:05.500
 with another group of individuals,

04:05.500 --> 04:08.840
 or one who might not be considered evil at all

04:08.840 --> 04:11.600
 might make the rational, seemingly rational choice

04:11.600 --> 04:13.280
 of inflicting pain and suffering

04:13.280 --> 04:15.240
 on a smaller group of people

04:15.240 --> 04:17.260
 in order to maximize the opposite of that

04:17.260 --> 04:19.040
 for a larger group of people.

04:19.040 --> 04:20.880
 Yeah, that's one of the dark things about,

04:20.880 --> 04:23.160
 I've spoken and read the work of Stephen Kotkin,

04:23.160 --> 04:25.340
 I'm not sure if you're familiar with the historian,

04:25.340 --> 04:30.040
 and he's basically a Stalin, a Joseph Stalin scholar.

04:30.040 --> 04:31.760
 And one of the things I realized,

04:32.600 --> 04:36.040
 I'm not sure where to put Hitler, but with Stalin,

04:37.000 --> 04:41.640
 it really seems that he was sane

04:41.640 --> 04:44.600
 and he thought he was doing good for the world.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.960
 I really believe from everything I've read about Stalin

04:47.960 --> 04:52.800
 that he believed that communism is good for the world.

04:52.800 --> 04:56.320
 And if you have to kill a few people along the way,

04:56.320 --> 04:57.880
 it's like you said, the small groups,

04:57.880 --> 05:01.280
 if you have to sort of remove the people

05:01.280 --> 05:06.280
 that stand in the way of this utopian system of communism,

05:06.440 --> 05:08.640
 then that's actually good for the world.

05:08.640 --> 05:12.360
 And it didn't seem to me

05:12.360 --> 05:14.480
 that he could even consider the possibility

05:14.480 --> 05:16.280
 that he was evil.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.680
 He really thought he was doing good for the world.

05:18.680 --> 05:21.960
 And that stuck with me because he's one of the most,

05:21.960 --> 05:24.520
 is to our definition of evil,

05:24.520 --> 05:28.000
 he seems to have brought more evil onto this world

05:29.320 --> 05:31.680
 than almost any human in history.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.220
 And I don't know what to do with that.

05:35.220 --> 05:36.960
 Well, I'm fascinated with the concept,

05:36.960 --> 05:39.120
 so fascinated by it that the very first

05:39.120 --> 05:40.520
 hardcore history show we ever did,

05:40.520 --> 05:42.800
 which was a full 15 or 16 minutes,

05:42.800 --> 05:46.200
 was called Alexander versus Hitler.

05:46.200 --> 05:51.040
 And the entire question about it was the motivations, right?

05:51.040 --> 05:55.020
 So if you go to a court of law because you killed somebody,

05:55.020 --> 05:56.640
 one of the things they're going to consider

05:56.640 --> 05:59.000
 is why did you kill them, right?

05:59.000 --> 06:02.300
 And if you killed somebody, for example, in self defense,

06:02.300 --> 06:03.720
 you're going to be treated differently

06:03.720 --> 06:05.600
 than if you malicious killed somebody

06:05.600 --> 06:08.000
 maliciously to take their wallet, right?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.680
 And in the show, we wondered,

06:10.680 --> 06:12.840
 because I don't really make pronouncements,

06:12.840 --> 06:17.320
 but we wondered about if you believe Hitler's writings,

06:17.320 --> 06:20.720
 for example, Mein Kampf, which is written by a guy

06:20.720 --> 06:22.720
 who's a political figure who wants to get,

06:22.720 --> 06:24.520
 so I mean, it's about as believable

06:24.520 --> 06:26.880
 as any other political tract would be.

06:26.880 --> 06:31.260
 But in his mind, the things that he said that he had to do

06:31.260 --> 06:35.040
 were designed for the betterment of the German people, right?

06:35.040 --> 06:37.240
 Whereas Alexander the Great, once again,

06:37.240 --> 06:39.360
 this is somebody from more than 2000 years ago,

06:39.360 --> 06:42.280
 so with lots of propaganda in the intervening years,

06:42.280 --> 06:44.880
 but one of the views of Alexander the Great

06:44.880 --> 06:46.600
 is that the reason he did what he did

06:46.600 --> 06:49.360
 was to, for lack of a better word,

06:49.360 --> 06:51.880
 write his name in a more permanent graffiti

06:51.880 --> 06:53.240
 on the pages of history, right?

06:53.240 --> 06:55.160
 In other words, to glorify himself.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.440
 And if that's the case,

06:57.440 --> 07:00.060
 does that make Alexander a worse person than Hitler

07:00.060 --> 07:02.660
 because Hitler thought he was doing good,

07:02.660 --> 07:05.800
 whereas Alexander, if you believe the interpretation,

07:05.800 --> 07:08.140
 was simply trying to exalt Alexander.

07:08.140 --> 07:11.680
 So the motivations of the people doing these things,

07:11.680 --> 07:14.180
 it seems to me, matter.

07:14.180 --> 07:15.740
 I don't think you can just sit there and go,

07:15.740 --> 07:17.780
 the only thing that matters is the end result,

07:17.780 --> 07:20.820
 because that might've been an unintentional byproduct,

07:20.820 --> 07:22.760
 in which case, that person,

07:22.760 --> 07:25.640
 had you been able to show them the future,

07:25.640 --> 07:27.220
 might have changed what they were doing.

07:27.220 --> 07:30.880
 So were they evil or misguided or wrong or made the wrong?

07:30.880 --> 07:32.360
 So, and I hate to do that

07:32.360 --> 07:33.640
 because there's certain people like Hitler

07:33.640 --> 07:36.360
 that I don't feel deserve the benefit of the doubt.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.320
 At the same time, if you're fascinated

07:38.320 --> 07:42.040
 by the concept of evil and you delve into it deeply enough,

07:42.040 --> 07:43.520
 you're going to want to understand

07:43.520 --> 07:46.600
 why these evil people did what they did.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.240
 And sometimes it can confuse the hell out of you.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.560
 You know, who wants to sit there

07:50.560 --> 07:52.200
 and try to see things from Hitler's point of view

07:52.200 --> 07:53.160
 to get a better understanding

07:53.160 --> 07:54.760
 and sort of commiserate with.

07:54.760 --> 07:57.180
 So, but I'm, obviously, first history show,

07:57.180 --> 07:58.780
 I'm fascinated with the concept.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.500
 So do you think it's possible,

08:01.500 --> 08:03.200
 if we put ourselves in the mindset

08:03.200 --> 08:05.560
 of some of the people that have led,

08:05.560 --> 08:08.060
 created so much suffering in the world,

08:08.060 --> 08:12.520
 that all of them had their motivations were,

08:12.520 --> 08:15.180
 had good intentions underlying them?

08:15.180 --> 08:17.920
 No, I don't, it's simply because there's so many,

08:17.920 --> 08:20.680
 I mean, the law of averages would suggest

08:20.680 --> 08:21.520
 that that's not true.

08:21.520 --> 08:24.840
 I guess it is pure evil possible,

08:24.840 --> 08:28.000
 meaning you, again, it's slippery,

08:28.000 --> 08:31.360
 but you, the suffering is the goal.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.280
 Suffering, intentional suffering.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.120
 Yeah.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.160
 Yes, I think that, and I think that there's historical

08:36.160 --> 08:38.240
 figures that one could point,

08:38.240 --> 08:40.480
 but that gets to the deeper question of,

08:40.480 --> 08:42.340
 are these people sane?

08:42.340 --> 08:43.460
 Do they have something wrong with them?

08:43.460 --> 08:45.720
 Are they twisted from something in their youth?

08:48.040 --> 08:50.160
 You know, these are the kinds of things

08:50.160 --> 08:53.040
 where you start to delve into the psychological makeup

08:53.040 --> 08:53.960
 of these people.

08:53.960 --> 08:56.280
 In other words, is anybody born evil?

08:56.280 --> 08:58.840
 And I actually believe that some people are.

08:58.840 --> 09:01.480
 I think the DNA can get scrambled up in ways.

09:01.480 --> 09:03.800
 I think the question of evil is important too,

09:03.800 --> 09:05.720
 because I think it's an eye of the beholder thing.

09:05.720 --> 09:09.000
 I mean, if Hitler, for example, had been successful

09:09.000 --> 09:12.640
 and we were today on the sixth or seventh leader

09:12.640 --> 09:16.960
 of the Third Reich, since I think his entire history

09:16.960 --> 09:18.480
 would be viewed through a different lens,

09:18.480 --> 09:20.720
 because that's the way we do things, right?

09:20.720 --> 09:23.120
 Genghis Khan looks different to the Mongolians

09:23.120 --> 09:25.960
 than he does to the residents of Baghdad, right?

09:25.960 --> 09:28.880
 And I think, so an eye of the beholder question,

09:28.880 --> 09:30.600
 I think comes into all these sorts of things.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.720
 As you said, it's a very slippery question.

09:32.720 --> 09:35.280
 Where do you put, as somebody who's fascinated

09:35.280 --> 09:38.400
 by military history, where do you put violence

09:41.200 --> 09:43.400
 in terms of the human condition?

09:43.400 --> 09:47.040
 Is it core to being human or is it just a little tool

09:47.040 --> 09:49.320
 that we use every once in a while?

09:49.320 --> 09:52.000
 So I'm gonna respond to your question with a question.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.340
 What do you see the difference being

09:54.340 --> 09:56.800
 between violence and force?

09:57.720 --> 09:58.800
 Let me go farther.

09:58.800 --> 10:02.760
 I'm not sure that violence is something

10:02.760 --> 10:05.540
 that we have to put up with as human beings forever,

10:05.540 --> 10:09.540
 that we must resign ourselves to violence forever.

10:09.540 --> 10:12.760
 But I have a much harder time seeing us

10:12.760 --> 10:15.680
 able to abolish force.

10:15.680 --> 10:19.040
 And there's going to be some ground

10:19.040 --> 10:21.680
 where if those two things are not the same,

10:21.680 --> 10:23.400
 and I don't know that maybe they are,

10:23.400 --> 10:25.440
 where there's certainly some crossover.

10:25.440 --> 10:28.880
 And I think force, you're an engineer,

10:28.880 --> 10:30.040
 you'll understand this better than I did,

10:30.040 --> 10:32.020
 but think about it as a physical law.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.980
 If you can't stop something from moving

10:34.980 --> 10:36.940
 in a certain direction without pushing back

10:36.940 --> 10:40.400
 in that same direction, I'm not sure

10:40.400 --> 10:44.440
 that you can have a society or a civilization

10:44.440 --> 10:48.600
 without the ability to use a counter force

10:48.600 --> 10:50.520
 when things are going wrong,

10:50.520 --> 10:53.080
 whether it's on an individual level, right?

10:53.080 --> 10:55.060
 A person attacks another person,

10:55.060 --> 10:57.720
 so you step in to save that person,

10:57.720 --> 11:01.560
 or even at the highest levels of politics or anything else,

11:01.560 --> 11:04.480
 a counter force to stop the inertia

11:04.480 --> 11:07.280
 or the impetus of another movement.

11:07.280 --> 11:11.120
 So I think that force is a simple,

11:11.120 --> 11:13.940
 almost law of physics in human interaction,

11:13.940 --> 11:15.640
 especially at the civilizational level.

11:15.640 --> 11:18.560
 I think civilization requires a certain amount of,

11:18.560 --> 11:20.680
 if not violence, then force.

11:22.420 --> 11:23.920
 And again, they've talked, I mean,

11:23.920 --> 11:25.680
 it goes back into St. Augustine,

11:25.680 --> 11:28.800
 all kinds of Christian beliefs about the proper use of force

11:28.800 --> 11:31.900
 and people have philosophically tried to decide

11:31.900 --> 11:35.480
 between can you have sort of an ahimsa,

11:35.480 --> 11:38.600
 Buddhists sort of, we will be nonviolent toward everything

11:38.600 --> 11:42.080
 and exert no force, or there's a reason to have force

11:42.080 --> 11:44.880
 in order to create the space for good.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.440
 I think force is inevitable.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.240
 Now, we can talk, and I've not come up

11:50.240 --> 11:52.660
 to the conclusion myself, if there is a distinction

11:52.660 --> 11:54.720
 to be made between force and violence.

11:54.720 --> 11:58.400
 I mean, is a nonviolent force enough,

11:58.400 --> 12:02.120
 or is violence when done for the cause of good

12:02.120 --> 12:03.880
 a different thing than violence done

12:03.880 --> 12:05.660
 either for the cause of evil, as you would say,

12:05.660 --> 12:08.800
 or simply for random reasons?

12:08.800 --> 12:10.800
 I mean, we humans lack control sometimes.

12:10.800 --> 12:14.320
 We can be violent for no apparent reason or goal.

12:14.320 --> 12:15.160
 And that's it.

12:15.160 --> 12:18.000
 I mean, you look at the criminal justice system alone

12:18.000 --> 12:20.800
 and the way we interact with people

12:20.800 --> 12:23.800
 who are acting out in ways that we as a society

12:23.800 --> 12:25.920
 have decided is intolerable.

12:25.920 --> 12:28.000
 Can you deal with that without force

12:28.000 --> 12:29.320
 and at some level violence?

12:29.320 --> 12:30.160
 I don't know.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.960
 Can you maintain peacefulness without force?

12:32.960 --> 12:33.800
 I don't know.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.880
 Just to be a little bit more specific

12:36.880 --> 12:40.480
 about the idea of force, do you put force

12:40.480 --> 12:45.400
 as general enough to include force in the space of ideas?

12:45.400 --> 12:50.400
 So you mentioned Buddhism or religion or just Twitter.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.320
 I can think of no things farther apart than that.

12:56.320 --> 12:57.160
 Okay.

12:58.400 --> 13:03.120
 Is the battles we do in the space of ideas

13:03.120 --> 13:07.460
 of the great debates throughout history,

13:07.460 --> 13:09.560
 do you put force into that?

13:09.560 --> 13:12.720
 Or do you, in this conversation,

13:12.720 --> 13:16.000
 are we trying to right now keep it to just physical force

13:17.840 --> 13:20.640
 in saying that you have an intuition

13:20.640 --> 13:24.260
 that force might be with us much longer than violence?

13:25.120 --> 13:27.740
 I think the two bleed together.

13:27.740 --> 13:32.740
 So take, because it's always my go to example.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.480
 I'm afraid and I'm sure that the listeners all hate it,

13:35.480 --> 13:40.360
 but take Germany during the 1920s, early 1930s,

13:40.360 --> 13:42.440
 before the Nazis came to power.

13:42.440 --> 13:45.160
 And they were always involved in some level of force,

13:45.160 --> 13:46.960
 beating up in the streets or whatever it might be.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.940
 But think about it more like an intellectual discussion

13:49.940 --> 13:51.240
 until a certain point.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.800
 It would be difficult, I imagine,

13:55.800 --> 14:00.280
 to keep the intellectual counter force of ideas

14:00.280 --> 14:02.060
 from at some point degenerating

14:02.060 --> 14:06.920
 into something that's more coercion, counter force,

14:06.920 --> 14:09.440
 if we want to use the phrases we were just talking about.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.720
 So I think the two are intimately connected.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.120
 I mean, actions follow thought, right?

14:14.120 --> 14:16.840
 And at a certain point, I think,

14:16.840 --> 14:20.680
 especially when one is not achieving the goals

14:20.680 --> 14:24.400
 that they want to achieve through a peaceful discussion

14:24.400 --> 14:27.800
 or argumentation or trying to convince the other side,

14:27.800 --> 14:30.440
 that sometimes the next level of operations

14:30.440 --> 14:33.280
 is something a little bit more physically imposing,

14:33.280 --> 14:34.120
 if that makes sense.

14:34.120 --> 14:36.360
 We go from the intellectual to the physical.

14:36.360 --> 14:39.320
 Yeah, so it too easily spills over into violence.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.400
 Yes, and one leads to the other often.

14:41.400 --> 14:45.440
 So you kind of implied perhaps a hopeful message.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.320
 Let me ask it in the form of a question.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.160
 Do you think we'll always have war?

14:51.280 --> 14:52.860
 I think it goes to the first question too.

14:52.860 --> 14:56.720
 So for example, what do you do?

14:56.720 --> 14:59.760
 I mean, let's play with nation states now,

14:59.760 --> 15:02.000
 although I don't know that nation states

15:02.000 --> 15:03.200
 are something we should think of

15:03.200 --> 15:05.280
 as a permanent construct forever.

15:06.120 --> 15:08.320
 But how is one nation state

15:08.320 --> 15:10.720
 supposed to prevent another nation state

15:10.720 --> 15:12.560
 from acting in ways that it would see

15:12.560 --> 15:14.760
 as either detrimental to the global community

15:14.760 --> 15:17.860
 or detrimental to the interest of their own nation state?

15:20.040 --> 15:22.620
 I think we've had this question

15:22.620 --> 15:25.300
 of going back to ancient times,

15:25.300 --> 15:26.780
 but certainly in the 20th century,

15:26.780 --> 15:27.840
 this has come up quite a bit.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.360
 I mean, the whole Second World War argument

15:30.360 --> 15:32.080
 sometimes revolves around the idea

15:32.080 --> 15:34.760
 of what the proper counterforce should be.

15:34.760 --> 15:37.080
 Can you create an entity, a league of nations,

15:37.080 --> 15:41.280
 the United Nations, a one world entity maybe even

15:41.280 --> 15:44.320
 that alleviates the need for counterforce

15:44.320 --> 15:46.580
 involving mass violence and armies and navies

15:46.580 --> 15:47.700
 and those things?

15:47.700 --> 15:50.300
 I think that's an open discussion we're still having.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.800
 It's good to think through that

15:53.800 --> 15:57.140
 because having something like a United Nations,

15:57.140 --> 15:59.060
 there's usually a centralized control.

15:59.060 --> 16:01.240
 So there's humans at the top,

16:01.240 --> 16:05.200
 there's committees and usually like leaders

16:05.200 --> 16:07.320
 emerge as singular figures

16:07.320 --> 16:10.760
 that then can become corrupted by power.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.520
 And it's just a really important,

16:12.520 --> 16:15.200
 it feels like a really important thought experiment

16:15.200 --> 16:18.420
 and something to really rigorously think through.

16:18.420 --> 16:21.040
 How can you construct systems of government

16:21.960 --> 16:26.960
 that are stable enough to push us towards less and less war

16:28.320 --> 16:33.320
 and less and less unstable and another tough word,

16:33.320 --> 16:38.320
 another tough word which is unfair of application of force?

16:39.720 --> 16:42.400
 You know, that's really at the core of the question

16:42.400 --> 16:44.760
 that we're trying to figure out as humans,

16:44.760 --> 16:46.720
 as our weapons get better and better and better

16:46.720 --> 16:48.360
 destroying ourselves,

16:48.360 --> 16:50.880
 it feels like it's important to think about

16:50.880 --> 16:54.960
 how we minimize the over application

16:54.960 --> 16:56.940
 or unfair application of force.

16:57.860 --> 16:59.440
 There's other elements that come into play too.

16:59.440 --> 17:00.440
 You and I are discussing this

17:00.440 --> 17:02.720
 at the very high intellectual level of things,

17:02.720 --> 17:05.440
 but there's also a tail wagging the dog element to this.

17:05.440 --> 17:08.200
 So think of a society of warriors,

17:08.200 --> 17:11.520
 a tribal society from a long time ago.

17:11.520 --> 17:15.580
 How much do the fact that you have warriors in your society

17:15.580 --> 17:17.560
 and that their reason for existing,

17:17.560 --> 17:20.060
 what they take pride in, what they train for,

17:20.960 --> 17:23.080
 what their status in their own civilization,

17:23.080 --> 17:24.840
 how much does that itself

17:24.840 --> 17:28.520
 drive the responses of that society, right?

17:28.520 --> 17:33.040
 How much do you need war to legitimize warriors?

17:33.040 --> 17:34.640
 That's the old argument that you get to

17:34.640 --> 17:36.200
 and we've had this in the 20th century too,

17:36.200 --> 17:39.320
 that the creation of arms and armies

17:39.320 --> 17:42.880
 creates an incentive to use them, right?

17:42.880 --> 17:45.360
 And that they themselves can drive that incentive

17:45.360 --> 17:48.860
 as a justification for their reasons for existence.

17:50.240 --> 17:52.720
 That's where we start to talk about the interactivity

17:52.720 --> 17:55.880
 of all these different elements of society upon one another.

17:55.880 --> 17:58.520
 So when we talk about governments and war,

17:58.520 --> 18:00.280
 well, you need to take into account

18:00.280 --> 18:02.280
 the various things those governments have put into place

18:02.280 --> 18:05.120
 in terms of systems and armies and things like that

18:05.120 --> 18:06.440
 to protect themselves, right?

18:06.440 --> 18:08.100
 For reasons we can all understand,

18:08.100 --> 18:13.100
 but they exert a force on your range of choices, don't they?

18:13.240 --> 18:14.080
 It's true.

18:14.080 --> 18:17.040
 You're making me realize that in my upbringing

18:17.040 --> 18:21.480
 and I think upbringing of many, warriors are heroes.

18:21.480 --> 18:25.120
 To me, I don't know where that feeling comes from,

18:25.120 --> 18:28.400
 but to sort of die fighting

18:29.560 --> 18:34.400
 is an honorable way to die, it feels like that.

18:34.400 --> 18:35.640
 I've always had a problem with this

18:35.640 --> 18:38.200
 because as a person interested in military history,

18:38.200 --> 18:40.000
 the distinction is important

18:40.000 --> 18:42.640
 and I try to make it at different levels.

18:42.640 --> 18:45.800
 So at base level, the people who are out there

18:45.800 --> 18:48.800
 on the front lines doing the fighting,

18:48.800 --> 18:52.480
 to me, those people can be compared with police officers

18:52.480 --> 18:55.720
 and firemen and people, fire persons,

18:56.800 --> 18:59.800
 but I mean, people that are involved

18:59.800 --> 19:04.800
 in an ethical attempt to perform a task

19:05.140 --> 19:08.720
 which ultimately one can see in many situations

19:08.720 --> 19:12.880
 as being a saving sort of task, right?

19:12.880 --> 19:15.720
 Or if nothing else, a self sacrifice

19:15.720 --> 19:17.320
 for what they see as the greater good.

19:17.320 --> 19:20.880
 Now, I draw a distinction between the individuals

19:20.880 --> 19:22.400
 and the entity that they're a part of,

19:22.400 --> 19:25.280
 a military, and I certainly draw a distinction

19:25.280 --> 19:27.840
 between the military and then the entire,

19:27.840 --> 19:30.540
 for lack of a better word, military industrial complex

19:30.540 --> 19:32.840
 that that service is a part of.

19:32.840 --> 19:37.040
 I feel a lot less moral attachment

19:37.040 --> 19:40.560
 to those upper echelons than I do the people on the ground.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.200
 The people on the ground could be any of us

19:42.200 --> 19:43.800
 and have been in a lot of,

19:43.800 --> 19:46.720
 we have a very professional sort of military now

19:46.720 --> 19:50.160
 where it's a very, a subset of the population,

19:50.160 --> 19:53.680
 but in other periods of time, we've had conscription

19:53.680 --> 19:56.640
 and drafts and it hasn't been a subset of the population,

19:56.640 --> 19:58.640
 it's been the population, right?

19:58.640 --> 20:01.680
 And so it is the society oftentimes going to war

20:01.680 --> 20:04.480
 and I make a distinction between those warriors

20:04.480 --> 20:06.920
 and the entities either in the system

20:06.920 --> 20:08.240
 that they're a part of the military

20:08.240 --> 20:10.700
 or the people that control the military

20:10.700 --> 20:12.240
 at the highest political levels.

20:12.240 --> 20:15.840
 I feel a lot less moral attachment to them

20:15.840 --> 20:19.580
 and I'm much harsher about how I feel about them.

20:19.580 --> 20:24.580
 I do not consider the military itself to be heroic

20:25.080 --> 20:27.520
 and I do not consider the military industrial complex

20:27.520 --> 20:28.800
 to be heroic.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.800
 I do think that is a tail wagging the dog situation.

20:31.800 --> 20:36.800
 I do think that draws us into looking at military endeavors

20:36.800 --> 20:39.560
 as a solution to the problem much more quickly

20:39.560 --> 20:41.160
 than we otherwise might.

20:41.160 --> 20:42.880
 And to be honest, to tie it all together,

20:42.880 --> 20:45.500
 I actually look at the victims of this

20:45.500 --> 20:47.480
 as the soldiers we were talking about.

20:47.480 --> 20:52.480
 If you set a fire to send firemen into to fight,

20:53.800 --> 20:55.680
 then I feel bad for the firemen.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.620
 I feel like you've abused the trust

20:57.620 --> 20:58.860
 that you give those people, right?

20:58.860 --> 21:01.160
 So when people talk about war,

21:01.160 --> 21:03.900
 I always think that the people that we have to make sure

21:03.900 --> 21:07.800
 that a war is really necessary in order to protect

21:07.800 --> 21:09.220
 are the people that you're gonna send over there

21:09.220 --> 21:10.060
 to fight that.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.600
 The greatest victims in our society of war

21:12.600 --> 21:14.200
 are often the warriors.

21:14.200 --> 21:18.120
 So in my mind, when we see these people coming home

21:18.120 --> 21:19.440
 from places like Iraq,

21:19.440 --> 21:21.720
 a place where I would have made the argument

21:21.720 --> 21:24.080
 and did at the time that we didn't belong.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.520
 To me, those people are victims

21:26.520 --> 21:28.040
 and I know they don't like to think about themselves

21:28.040 --> 21:31.320
 that way because it runs totally counter to the ethos.

21:31.320 --> 21:35.800
 But if you're sending people to protect this country's shores,

21:35.800 --> 21:37.440
 those are heroes.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.920
 If you're sending people to go do something

21:39.920 --> 21:42.040
 that they otherwise probably don't need to do

21:42.040 --> 21:43.560
 but they're there for political reasons

21:43.560 --> 21:44.760
 or anything else you wanna put in

21:44.760 --> 21:46.400
 that's not defense related,

21:46.400 --> 21:48.680
 well then you've made victims of our heroes.

21:48.680 --> 21:52.540
 And so I feel like we do a lot of talk

21:52.540 --> 21:54.520
 about our troops and our soldiers and stuff

21:54.520 --> 21:56.980
 but we don't treat them as valuable

21:56.980 --> 21:59.640
 as the rhetoric makes them sound.

21:59.640 --> 22:03.700
 Otherwise, we would be much more careful

22:03.700 --> 22:05.080
 about where we put them.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.800
 If you're gonna send my son,

22:06.800 --> 22:07.960
 and I don't have a son, I have daughters,

22:07.960 --> 22:11.760
 but if you're gonna send my son into harm's way,

22:11.760 --> 22:14.460
 I'm going to demand that you really need

22:14.460 --> 22:15.680
 to be sending him into harm's way

22:15.680 --> 22:17.320
 and I'm going to be angry at you

22:17.320 --> 22:21.240
 if you put him into harm's way if it doesn't warrant it.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.800
 And so I have much more suspicion about the system

22:23.800 --> 22:25.880
 that sends these people into these situations

22:25.880 --> 22:28.360
 where they're required to be heroic

22:28.360 --> 22:29.600
 than I do the people on the ground

22:29.600 --> 22:32.680
 that I look at as either the people

22:32.680 --> 22:34.980
 that are defending us in situations

22:34.980 --> 22:37.160
 like the Second World War, for example,

22:37.160 --> 22:41.400
 or the people that turn out to be the individual victims

22:41.400 --> 22:44.000
 of a system where they're just a cog in a machine

22:44.000 --> 22:46.920
 and the machine doesn't really care as much about them

22:46.920 --> 22:51.920
 as the rhetoric and the propaganda would insinuate.

22:51.920 --> 22:54.840
 Yeah, and as my own family history,

22:54.840 --> 22:57.520
 it would be nice if we could talk about

22:57.520 --> 23:00.060
 there's a gray area in the places

23:00.060 --> 23:01.480
 that you're talking about.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.040
 There's a gray area in everything.

23:03.040 --> 23:03.880
 In everything.

23:05.240 --> 23:08.840
 But when that gray area is part of your own blood,

23:08.840 --> 23:13.840
 as it is for me, it's worth shining a light on somehow.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.680
 Sure, give me an example of what you mean.

23:17.680 --> 23:20.520
 So you did a program of four episodes

23:20.520 --> 23:22.240
 of Ghosts of the Ostfront.

23:22.240 --> 23:23.080
 Yeah.

23:23.080 --> 23:26.620
 So I was born in the Soviet Union.

23:26.620 --> 23:27.820
 I was raised in Moscow.

23:27.820 --> 23:30.640
 My dad was born and raised in Kiev.

23:30.640 --> 23:33.160
 My grandmother, who just recently passed away,

23:33.160 --> 23:38.160
 was raised in Ukraine.

23:38.160 --> 23:39.640
 A city.

23:39.640 --> 23:44.240
 It's a small city on the border between Russia and Ukraine.

23:44.240 --> 23:45.720
 I have a grandfather born in Kiev.

23:45.720 --> 23:46.720
 In Kiev.

23:46.720 --> 23:49.640
 The interesting thing about the timing of everything,

23:49.640 --> 23:52.940
 as you might be able to connect, is she survived.

23:52.940 --> 23:57.100
 She's the most badass woman I've ever encountered in my life

23:57.100 --> 24:01.640
 and most of the warrior spirit I carry is probably from her.

24:01.640 --> 24:04.600
 She survived Polar Mor, the Ukrainian starvation

24:04.600 --> 24:05.840
 of the 30s.

24:05.840 --> 24:08.600
 She was a beautiful teenage girl

24:08.600 --> 24:11.200
 during the Nazi occupation of,

24:11.200 --> 24:14.320
 so she survived all of that.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.920
 And of course, family that everybody,

24:17.720 --> 24:21.280
 and so many people died through that whole process.

24:21.280 --> 24:25.240
 And one of the things you talk about in your program

24:25.240 --> 24:30.240
 is that the gray area is, even with the warriors,

24:30.240 --> 24:33.960
 it happened to them, just like as you're saying now,

24:33.960 --> 24:35.520
 they didn't have a choice.

24:35.520 --> 24:38.400
 So my grandfather on the other side,

24:38.400 --> 24:43.400
 he was a machine gunner that was in Ukraine that.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.840
 In the Red Army?

24:46.840 --> 24:48.080
 In the Red Army, yeah.

24:48.080 --> 24:53.080
 And they threw, like the statement was that there's,

24:54.240 --> 24:55.520
 I don't know if it's obvious or not,

24:55.520 --> 24:57.740
 but the rule was there's no surrender.

24:57.740 --> 24:59.860
 So you better die.

24:59.860 --> 25:02.080
 So you, I mean, you're basically,

25:02.080 --> 25:04.920
 the goal was when he was fighting

25:04.920 --> 25:06.400
 and he was lucky enough,

25:06.400 --> 25:10.880
 one of the only to survive by being wounded early on

25:10.880 --> 25:15.880
 is there was a march of Nazis towards, I guess, Moscow.

25:16.560 --> 25:21.160
 And the whole goal in Ukraine was to slow every,

25:21.160 --> 25:23.840
 to slow them into the winter.

25:23.840 --> 25:26.800
 I mean, I view him as such a hero

25:26.800 --> 25:31.640
 and he believed that he's indestructible,

25:31.640 --> 25:33.760
 which is survivor bias.

25:33.760 --> 25:37.880
 And that, you know, bullets can't hurt him.

25:37.880 --> 25:39.640
 And that's what everybody believed.

25:39.640 --> 25:43.480
 And of course, basically everyone that,

25:43.480 --> 25:46.300
 he quickly rose to the ranks, let's just put it this way,

25:46.300 --> 25:48.320
 because everybody died.

25:48.320 --> 25:53.320
 It was just bodies dragging these heavy machine guns,

25:53.620 --> 25:56.880
 like always, you know, always slowly retreating,

25:56.880 --> 25:59.760
 shooting and retreating, shooting and retreating.

25:59.760 --> 26:04.760
 And I don't know, he was a hero to me, like I always,

26:06.600 --> 26:08.640
 I grew up thinking that he was the one

26:08.640 --> 26:11.340
 that sort of defeated the Nazis, right?

26:11.340 --> 26:14.200
 And, but the reality that there could be another perspective,

26:14.200 --> 26:16.880
 which is all of this happened to him

26:16.880 --> 26:21.280
 by the incompetence of Stalin, the incompetence

26:21.280 --> 26:26.280
 and men of the Soviet Union being used like pawns

26:26.280 --> 26:30.120
 in a shittily played game of chess, right?

26:30.120 --> 26:35.120
 So like the one narrative is of him as a victim,

26:35.500 --> 26:37.500
 as you're kind of describing.

26:37.500 --> 26:42.500
 And then somehow that's more paralyzing and that's more,

26:43.500 --> 26:48.500
 I don't know, it feels better to think of him as a hero

26:48.620 --> 26:52.300
 and as Russia, Soviet Union saving the world.

26:52.300 --> 26:53.940
 I mean, that narrative also,

26:53.940 --> 26:57.860
 is in the United States that the United States was key

26:57.860 --> 27:00.100
 in saving the world from the Nazis.

27:00.100 --> 27:03.140
 It feels like that narrative is powerful for people.

27:03.140 --> 27:06.740
 I'm not sure, and I carry it still with me,

27:06.740 --> 27:09.500
 but when I think about the right way

27:09.500 --> 27:11.380
 to think about that war,

27:11.380 --> 27:13.580
 I'm not sure if that's the correct narrative.

27:14.580 --> 27:15.940
 Let me suggest something.

27:15.940 --> 27:20.940
 There's a line that a Marine named Eugene Sledge had to say

27:20.940 --> 27:23.940
 once and I keep it on my phone because it's,

27:23.940 --> 27:25.860
 it makes a real distinction.

27:25.860 --> 27:30.300
 And he said, the front line is really where the war is.

27:30.300 --> 27:33.900
 And anybody, even a hundred yards behind the front line

27:33.900 --> 27:36.500
 doesn't know what it's really like.

27:36.500 --> 27:39.940
 Now, the difference is, is there are lots of people miles

27:39.940 --> 27:42.140
 behind the front line that are in danger, right?

27:42.140 --> 27:44.180
 You can be in a medical unit in the rear

27:44.180 --> 27:46.980
 and artillery could strike you, planes could strike me.

27:46.980 --> 27:48.300
 You could be in danger,

27:48.300 --> 27:50.980
 but at the front line, there are two different things.

27:50.980 --> 27:53.940
 One is that, and at least,

27:53.940 --> 27:55.580
 and I'm doing a lot of reading on this right now

27:55.580 --> 27:57.820
 and reading a lot of veterans accounts.

27:57.820 --> 28:01.700
 James Jones, who wrote books like From Here to Eternity,

28:01.700 --> 28:03.660
 fictional accounts of the Second World War,

28:03.660 --> 28:05.700
 but he based them on his own service.

28:05.700 --> 28:08.980
 He was at Guadalcanal, for example, in 1942.

28:08.980 --> 28:12.460
 And Jones had said that the evolution of a soldier

28:12.460 --> 28:16.020
 in front line action requires a lot of

28:16.020 --> 28:20.180
 front line action requires an almost surrendering

28:20.180 --> 28:22.460
 to the idea that you're going to live,

28:22.460 --> 28:24.780
 that you become accustomed to the idea

28:24.780 --> 28:26.340
 that you're going to die.

28:26.340 --> 28:28.500
 And he said, you're a different person

28:28.500 --> 28:31.340
 simply for considering that thought seriously,

28:31.340 --> 28:32.980
 because most of us don't.

28:32.980 --> 28:35.460
 But what that allows you to do is to do that job

28:35.460 --> 28:36.740
 at the front line, right?

28:36.740 --> 28:40.340
 If you're too concerned about your own life,

28:40.340 --> 28:44.460
 you become less of a good guy at your job, right?

28:44.460 --> 28:47.220
 The other thing that the people in the 100 yards

28:47.220 --> 28:49.220
 at the front line do that the people

28:49.220 --> 28:51.620
 in the rear medical unit really don't,

28:51.620 --> 28:54.100
 is you kill and you kill a lot, right?

28:54.100 --> 28:55.820
 You don't just, oh, there's a sniper back here

28:55.820 --> 28:56.740
 so I shot him.

28:56.740 --> 28:58.900
 It's we go from one position to another

28:58.900 --> 29:01.060
 and we kill lots of people.

29:01.060 --> 29:02.620
 Those things will change you.

29:02.620 --> 29:05.420
 And what that tends to do, not universally,

29:05.420 --> 29:08.420
 because I've read accounts from Red Army soldiers

29:08.420 --> 29:10.700
 and they're very patriotic, right?

29:10.700 --> 29:13.620
 But a lot of that patriotism comes through years later

29:13.620 --> 29:16.620
 as part of the nostalgia and the remembering.

29:16.620 --> 29:19.300
 When you're down at that front 100 yards,

29:19.300 --> 29:22.140
 it is often boiled down to a very small world.

29:22.140 --> 29:24.580
 So your grandfather, was it your grandfather?

29:24.580 --> 29:25.420
 Grandfather.

29:25.420 --> 29:28.900
 At the machine gun, he's concerned about his position

29:28.900 --> 29:30.700
 and his comrades and the people

29:30.700 --> 29:32.740
 who he owes a responsibility to.

29:32.740 --> 29:35.380
 And those, it's a very small world at that point.

29:35.380 --> 29:37.420
 And to me, that's where the heroism is, right?

29:37.420 --> 29:39.860
 He's not fighting for some giant world,

29:39.860 --> 29:40.940
 civilizational thing.

29:40.940 --> 29:43.540
 He's fighting to save the people next to him.

29:43.540 --> 29:44.980
 And his own life at the same time

29:44.980 --> 29:46.940
 because they're saving him too.

29:46.940 --> 29:49.900
 And that there is a huge amount of heroism to that.

29:49.900 --> 29:52.220
 And that gets to our question about force earlier.

29:52.220 --> 29:53.780
 Why would you use force?

29:53.780 --> 29:55.700
 Well, how about to protect these people

29:55.700 --> 29:56.740
 on either side of me, right?

29:56.740 --> 29:57.720
 Their lives.

29:59.020 --> 30:01.060
 Now, is there hatred?

30:01.060 --> 30:03.300
 Yeah, I hated the Germans for what they were doing.

30:03.300 --> 30:06.220
 As a matter of fact, I got a note from a poll

30:06.220 --> 30:07.420
 not that long ago.

30:07.420 --> 30:10.740
 And I have this tendency to refer to the Nazis, right?

30:10.740 --> 30:12.420
 The regime that was, and he said,

30:12.420 --> 30:14.060
 why do you keep calling them Nazis?

30:14.060 --> 30:15.740
 He says, say what they were.

30:15.740 --> 30:17.020
 They were Germans.

30:17.020 --> 30:21.240
 And this guy wanted me to not absolve Germany

30:21.240 --> 30:23.460
 by saying, oh, it was this awful group of people

30:23.460 --> 30:24.540
 that took over your country.

30:24.540 --> 30:26.340
 He said, the Germans did this.

30:26.340 --> 30:28.540
 And there's that bitterness where he says,

30:28.540 --> 30:30.860
 let's not forget what they did to us

30:30.860 --> 30:33.740
 and what we had to do back, right?

30:33.740 --> 30:37.140
 So for me, when we talk about these combat situations,

30:37.140 --> 30:40.240
 the reason I call these people heroic is because of,

30:40.240 --> 30:42.860
 they're fighting to defend things we could all understand.

30:42.860 --> 30:45.300
 I mean, if you come after my brother

30:45.300 --> 30:47.580
 and I take a machine gun and shoot you

30:48.540 --> 30:49.580
 and you're gonna overrun me,

30:49.580 --> 30:51.980
 I mean, that becomes a situation

30:51.980 --> 30:54.180
 where we talked about counterforce earlier.

30:55.140 --> 30:56.920
 Much easier to call yourself a hero

30:56.920 --> 30:57.980
 when you're saving people

30:57.980 --> 30:59.860
 or you're saving this town right behind you.

30:59.860 --> 31:02.340
 And you know, if they get through your machine gun,

31:02.340 --> 31:03.520
 they're gonna burn these villages.

31:03.520 --> 31:04.580
 They're gonna throw these people out

31:04.580 --> 31:06.680
 in the middle of winter, these families.

31:06.680 --> 31:09.420
 That to me is a very different sort of heroism

31:09.420 --> 31:13.060
 than this amorphous idea of patriotism.

31:13.060 --> 31:14.340
 And you know, patriotism is a thing

31:14.340 --> 31:17.460
 that we often get used with, right?

31:17.460 --> 31:21.440
 People manipulate us through love of country and all this

31:21.440 --> 31:22.340
 because they understand

31:22.340 --> 31:24.020
 that this is something we feel very strongly,

31:24.020 --> 31:26.480
 but they use it against us sometimes

31:26.480 --> 31:29.460
 in order to whip up a war fever or to get people.

31:29.460 --> 31:30.980
 I mean, there's a great line

31:30.980 --> 31:32.660
 and I wish I could remember it in its entirety

31:32.660 --> 31:35.460
 that Herman Goering had said about how easy it was

31:35.460 --> 31:37.240
 to get the people into a war.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.380
 He says, you know, you just appeal to their patriotism,

31:39.380 --> 31:41.540
 you, I mean, there's buttons that you can push

31:41.540 --> 31:44.500
 and they take advantage of things like love of country

31:44.500 --> 31:48.080
 and the way we have a loyalty and an admiration

31:48.080 --> 31:50.180
 to the warriors who put their lives on the line.

31:50.180 --> 31:53.860
 These are manipulatable things in the human species

31:53.860 --> 31:57.740
 that reliably can be counted on to move us

31:57.740 --> 32:02.740
 in directions that in a more sober, reflective state of mind

32:03.740 --> 32:05.140
 we would consider differently.

32:05.140 --> 32:07.020
 It gets the, I mean, you get this war fever up

32:07.020 --> 32:09.940
 and people wave flags and they start denouncing the enemy

32:09.940 --> 32:11.920
 and they start signing, you know, we've seen it over

32:11.920 --> 32:14.660
 and over and over again in ancient times this happened.

32:14.660 --> 32:17.340
 But the love of country is also beautiful.

32:17.340 --> 32:19.900
 So I haven't seen it in America as much.

32:19.900 --> 32:22.180
 So people in America love their country,

32:22.180 --> 32:24.820
 like this patriotism is strong in America,

32:24.820 --> 32:27.520
 but it's not as strong as I remember,

32:27.520 --> 32:30.420
 even with my sort of being younger,

32:30.420 --> 32:32.860
 the love of the Soviet Union.

32:33.780 --> 32:36.680
 Now, was it the Soviet Union this requires a distinction

32:36.680 --> 32:39.140
 or was it mother Russia?

32:39.140 --> 32:41.300
 What it really was, was the communist party.

32:41.300 --> 32:43.660
 Okay, so it was the system in place, okay.

32:43.660 --> 32:46.340
 The system in place, like loving,

32:46.340 --> 32:49.980
 I haven't quite deeply synchronized exactly what you love.

32:49.980 --> 32:54.980
 I think you love that like populist message of the worker,

32:56.540 --> 32:59.100
 of the common man, the common person.

32:59.100 --> 33:01.440
 Let me draw the comparison then.

33:01.440 --> 33:04.560
 And I often say this, that the United States

33:04.560 --> 33:09.560
 like the Soviet Union is an ideological based society, right?

33:09.940 --> 33:12.560
 So you take a country like France,

33:13.380 --> 33:16.100
 it doesn't matter which French government you're in now.

33:16.100 --> 33:19.060
 The French have been the French for a long time, right?

33:19.060 --> 33:22.700
 It's not based on an ideology, right?

33:22.700 --> 33:26.260
 Whereas what unites the United States is an ideology,

33:26.260 --> 33:28.460
 freedom, liberty, the constitution.

33:28.460 --> 33:29.500
 This is what draws, you know,

33:29.500 --> 33:32.100
 it's the e pluribus unum kind of the idea, right?

33:32.100 --> 33:34.900
 That out of many one, well, what binds

33:34.900 --> 33:37.020
 all these unique different people?

33:37.020 --> 33:39.380
 The shared beliefs, this ideology.

33:39.380 --> 33:40.780
 The Soviet Union was the same way.

33:40.780 --> 33:42.180
 Cause as you know, the Soviet Union,

33:42.180 --> 33:45.860
 Russia was merely one part of the Soviet Union.

33:45.860 --> 33:49.180
 And if you believe the rhetoric until Stalin's time,

33:49.180 --> 33:52.000
 everybody was going to be united

33:52.000 --> 33:54.300
 under this ideological banner someday, right?

33:54.300 --> 33:56.040
 It was a global revolution.

33:56.920 --> 33:59.100
 So ideological societies are different.

33:59.100 --> 34:03.840
 And to be a fan of the ideological framework and goal,

34:03.840 --> 34:05.860
 I mean, I'm a Liberty person, right?

34:05.860 --> 34:08.500
 I would like to see everybody in the world

34:08.500 --> 34:09.760
 have my system of government,

34:09.760 --> 34:12.460
 which is part of a bias, right?

34:12.460 --> 34:14.220
 Because they might not want that.

34:14.220 --> 34:16.020
 But I think it's better for everyone

34:16.020 --> 34:17.860
 cause I think it's better for me.

34:17.860 --> 34:20.900
 At the same time, when the ideology,

34:20.900 --> 34:22.380
 if you consider, and you know,

34:22.380 --> 34:25.300
 this stems from ideas of the enlightenment

34:25.300 --> 34:26.620
 and there's a bias there.

34:26.620 --> 34:28.860
 So my bias are toward the, but you feel,

34:28.860 --> 34:29.700
 and this is why you say,

34:29.700 --> 34:30.780
 we're going to bring freedom to Iraq.

34:30.780 --> 34:31.620
 We're going to bring freedom to here.

34:31.620 --> 34:32.460
 We're going to bring freedom

34:32.460 --> 34:34.340
 because we think we're spreading to you

34:34.340 --> 34:37.940
 something that is just undeniably positive.

34:37.940 --> 34:40.900
 We're going to free you and give you this.

34:42.900 --> 34:47.780
 It's hard for me to wipe my own bias away from there, right?

34:47.780 --> 34:50.220
 Cause if I were in Iraq, for example,

34:50.220 --> 34:51.860
 I would want freedom, right?

34:51.860 --> 34:54.780
 But if you then leave and let the Iraqis vote

34:54.780 --> 34:56.300
 for whomever they want,

34:56.300 --> 34:58.660
 are they going to vote for somebody that will,

34:58.660 --> 35:01.540
 I mean, you know, you look at Russia now

35:01.540 --> 35:03.140
 and I hear from Russians quite a bit

35:03.140 --> 35:06.660
 because so much of my views on Russia

35:06.660 --> 35:09.820
 and the Soviet Union were formed in my formative years.

35:09.820 --> 35:12.700
 And, you know, we were not hearing from many people

35:12.700 --> 35:14.860
 in the Soviet Union back then, but now you do.

35:14.860 --> 35:16.500
 You hear from Russians today who will say,

35:16.500 --> 35:18.980
 your views on Stalin are archaic and cold.

35:18.980 --> 35:21.780
 You know, so you try to reorient your beliefs a little bit,

35:21.780 --> 35:23.260
 but it goes to this idea of,

35:23.260 --> 35:27.060
 if you gave the people in Russia a free and fair vote,

35:27.060 --> 35:29.260
 will they vote for somebody who promises them

35:29.260 --> 35:30.660
 a free and open society

35:30.660 --> 35:33.060
 based on enlightenment democratic principles?

35:33.060 --> 35:34.180
 Or will they vote for somebody,

35:34.180 --> 35:36.260
 we in the US would go, what are they doing?

35:36.260 --> 35:38.540
 They're voting for some strong man who's just good.

35:38.540 --> 35:41.940
 You know, so I think it's very hard to throw away

35:41.940 --> 35:45.220
 our own biases and preconceptions.

35:45.220 --> 35:48.780
 And, you know, it's an all eye of the beholder kind of thing.

35:48.780 --> 35:52.060
 But when you're talking about ideological societies,

35:52.060 --> 35:55.100
 it is very difficult to throw off

35:55.100 --> 35:57.140
 all the years of indoctrination

35:57.140 --> 35:59.660
 into the superiority of your system.

35:59.660 --> 36:01.500
 I mean, listen, in the Soviet Union,

36:01.500 --> 36:04.780
 Marxism one way or another was part of every classrooms.

36:04.780 --> 36:06.640
 You know, you could be studying geometry

36:06.640 --> 36:09.080
 and they'll throw Marxism in there somehow,

36:09.080 --> 36:11.580
 because that's what united the society.

36:11.580 --> 36:13.540
 And that's what gave it a higher purpose.

36:13.540 --> 36:16.500
 And that's what made it in the minds of the people

36:16.500 --> 36:17.820
 who were its defenders,

36:17.820 --> 36:20.500
 a superior, morally superior system.

36:20.500 --> 36:21.680
 And we do the same thing here.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.820
 In fact, most people do, but see, you're still French,

36:24.820 --> 36:28.100
 no matter what the ideology or the government might be.

36:28.100 --> 36:29.780
 So in that sense,

36:29.780 --> 36:31.720
 it's funny that there would be a cold war

36:31.720 --> 36:32.800
 with these two systems,

36:32.800 --> 36:35.620
 because they're both ideologically based systems

36:35.620 --> 36:38.300
 involving peoples of many different backgrounds

36:38.300 --> 36:42.060
 who are united under the umbrella of the ideology.

36:42.060 --> 36:45.120
 First of all, that's brilliantly put.

36:45.120 --> 36:48.620
 I'm in a funny position that in my formative years,

36:48.620 --> 36:50.160
 I came here when I was 13,

36:50.160 --> 36:55.160
 is when I, you know, teenage is your first love or whatever,

36:55.840 --> 36:59.700
 is I fell in love with the American set of ideas

36:59.700 --> 37:00.960
 of freedom and individuals.

37:00.960 --> 37:01.800
 They're compelling, aren't they?

37:01.800 --> 37:02.840
 Yes. They're compelling, yes.

37:02.840 --> 37:05.080
 But I also remember, it's like you remember

37:05.080 --> 37:07.480
 like maybe an ex girlfriend or something like that.

37:07.480 --> 37:12.480
 I also remember loving as a very different human,

37:13.300 --> 37:17.780
 the Soviet idea, like we had the national anthem,

37:17.780 --> 37:20.880
 which is still, I think the most badass national anthem,

37:20.880 --> 37:22.600
 which is the Soviet Union,

37:22.600 --> 37:24.760
 like saying we're the indestructible nation.

37:24.760 --> 37:26.920
 I mean, just the words are so,

37:26.920 --> 37:29.760
 like Americans words are like, oh, we're nice.

37:29.760 --> 37:31.320
 Like we're freedom,

37:31.320 --> 37:34.580
 but like a Russian Soviet Union national anthem was like,

37:34.580 --> 37:35.980
 we're bad motherfuckers.

37:35.980 --> 37:38.120
 Nobody will destroy us.

37:38.120 --> 37:41.860
 I just remember feeling pride in a nation as a kid,

37:41.860 --> 37:43.320
 like dumb not knowing anything

37:43.320 --> 37:45.360
 because we all had to recite the stuff.

37:45.360 --> 37:48.520
 It was, there's a uniformity to everything.

37:48.520 --> 37:50.460
 There's pride underlying everything.

37:50.460 --> 37:52.960
 I didn't think about all the destructive nature

37:52.960 --> 37:56.380
 of the bureaucracy, the incompetence,

37:56.380 --> 37:59.020
 the, you know, all the things that come

37:59.020 --> 38:01.880
 with the implementation of communism,

38:01.880 --> 38:05.120
 especially around the eighties and nineties.

38:06.120 --> 38:09.640
 But I remember what it's like to love that set of ideas.

38:09.640 --> 38:12.280
 So I'm in a funny place of like,

38:12.280 --> 38:14.600
 remember like switching the love

38:14.600 --> 38:15.600
 because I'm, you know,

38:15.600 --> 38:18.200
 I kind of joke around about being Russian,

38:18.200 --> 38:21.280
 but you know, my longterm monogamous relationship

38:21.280 --> 38:23.780
 is now with the idea, the American ideal.

38:23.780 --> 38:25.900
 Like I'm stuck with it in my mind,

38:25.900 --> 38:28.920
 but I remember what it was like to love it.

38:28.920 --> 38:30.400
 And I think about that too,

38:30.400 --> 38:33.420
 when people criticize China or they criticize

38:33.420 --> 38:37.260
 the current state of affairs with how Stalin is remembered

38:37.260 --> 38:42.260
 and how Putin is to know that the,

38:42.260 --> 38:47.260
 you can't always wear the American ideal of individualism,

38:48.220 --> 38:50.660
 radical individualism and freedom

38:50.660 --> 38:54.620
 in analyzing the ways of the world elsewhere.

38:54.620 --> 38:58.220
 Like in China, in Russia, that it does,

38:59.160 --> 39:01.360
 if you don't take yourself too seriously,

39:01.360 --> 39:03.300
 as Americans all do, as I do,

39:04.380 --> 39:09.220
 it's kind of a beautiful love to have for your government,

39:09.220 --> 39:13.100
 to believe in the nation, to let go of yourself

39:13.100 --> 39:15.340
 and your rights and your freedoms,

39:15.340 --> 39:18.000
 to believe in something bigger than yourself.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.020
 That's actually, that's a kind of freedom.

39:22.020 --> 39:24.660
 That's, you're actually liberating yourself.

39:24.660 --> 39:26.700
 If you think like life is suffering,

39:26.700 --> 39:30.180
 you're giving into the flow of the water,

39:30.180 --> 39:32.200
 the flow, the way of the world

39:32.200 --> 39:35.020
 by giving away more power from yourself

39:35.020 --> 39:37.340
 and giving it to what you would conceive as,

39:37.340 --> 39:40.080
 as the power of the people together,

39:40.080 --> 39:41.480
 together we'll do great things

39:41.480 --> 39:46.480
 and really believing in the ideals of what,

39:46.540 --> 39:50.300
 in this case, I don't even know what you would call Russia,

39:50.300 --> 39:51.660
 but whatever the heck that is,

39:51.660 --> 39:56.460
 authoritarian, powerful state, powerful leader,

39:56.460 --> 40:00.120
 believing that can be as beautiful

40:00.120 --> 40:02.280
 as believing the American ideal.

40:02.280 --> 40:04.460
 Not just that, let me add to what you're saying.

40:04.460 --> 40:07.740
 And I'm very, I spend a lot of time

40:07.740 --> 40:11.240
 trying to get out of my own biases.

40:11.240 --> 40:14.320
 It is a fruitless endeavor longterm,

40:14.320 --> 40:16.260
 but you try to be better than you normally are.

40:16.260 --> 40:19.160
 One of the critiques that China,

40:19.160 --> 40:20.620
 and I always, as an American,

40:20.620 --> 40:22.660
 I tend to think about this as their government, right?

40:22.660 --> 40:25.240
 This is a rationale that their government puts forward.

40:25.240 --> 40:27.900
 But what you just said is actually,

40:27.900 --> 40:30.460
 if you can make that viewpoint beautiful

40:30.460 --> 40:32.260
 is kind of a beautiful way of approaching it.

40:32.260 --> 40:36.060
 The Chinese would say that what we call human rights

40:36.060 --> 40:37.700
 in the United States and what we consider

40:37.700 --> 40:40.500
 to be everybody's birthright around the world

40:40.500 --> 40:42.900
 is instead Western rights.

40:42.900 --> 40:44.500
 That's the words they use, Western rights.

40:44.500 --> 40:47.980
 It's a fundamentally Western oriented,

40:47.980 --> 40:51.300
 and I'll go back to the enlightenment based ideas,

40:52.660 --> 40:55.540
 on what constitutes the rights of man.

40:55.540 --> 40:58.540
 And they would suggest that that's not internationally

40:58.540 --> 41:00.380
 and always applicable, right?

41:00.380 --> 41:03.460
 That you can make a case, and again, I don't believe this.

41:03.460 --> 41:05.340
 This runs against my own personal views,

41:05.340 --> 41:07.100
 but that you could make a case

41:07.100 --> 41:10.540
 that the collective wellbeing of a very large group

41:10.540 --> 41:14.180
 of people outweighs the individual needs

41:14.180 --> 41:17.280
 of any single person, especially if those things

41:17.280 --> 41:18.920
 are in conflict with each other, right?

41:18.920 --> 41:21.660
 If you cannot provide for the greater good

41:21.660 --> 41:24.260
 because everyone's so individualistic,

41:24.260 --> 41:27.060
 well then really what is the better thing to do, right?

41:27.060 --> 41:30.440
 Is suppress individualism so everybody's better off?

41:30.440 --> 41:34.780
 I think trying to recognize how someone else might see that

41:34.780 --> 41:36.260
 is important if we want to, you know,

41:36.260 --> 41:37.860
 you had talked about eliminating war.

41:37.860 --> 41:39.980
 We talk about eliminating conflict.

41:39.980 --> 41:42.700
 The first need to do that is to try to understand

41:42.700 --> 41:44.860
 how someone else might view something differently

41:44.860 --> 41:45.720
 than yourself.

41:47.340 --> 41:50.500
 I'm famously one of those people who buys in

41:50.500 --> 41:53.780
 to the ideas of traditional Americanism, right?

41:53.780 --> 41:56.540
 And look, what a lot of people who live today,

41:56.540 --> 42:00.540
 I mean, they would seem to think that things like patriotism

42:00.540 --> 42:04.100
 requires a belief in the strong military

42:04.100 --> 42:05.040
 and all these things we have today,

42:05.040 --> 42:07.480
 but that is a corruption of traditional Americanism,

42:07.480 --> 42:10.120
 which viewed all those things with suspicion

42:10.120 --> 42:12.020
 in the first hundred years of the Republic

42:12.020 --> 42:15.260
 because they saw it as an enemy to the very things

42:15.260 --> 42:17.140
 that Americans celebrated, right?

42:17.140 --> 42:20.100
 How could you have freedom and liberty

42:20.100 --> 42:23.100
 and individualistic expression

42:23.100 --> 42:24.900
 if you had an overriding military

42:24.900 --> 42:26.740
 that was always fighting wars

42:26.740 --> 42:29.340
 and the founders of this country looked to other examples

42:29.340 --> 42:30.820
 like Europe, for example,

42:30.820 --> 42:33.420
 and saw that standing militaries, for example,

42:33.420 --> 42:36.720
 standing armies were the enemy of liberty.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.740
 Well, we have a standing army now

42:38.740 --> 42:43.320
 and one that is totally interwoven in our entire society.

42:43.320 --> 42:47.740
 If you could go back in time and talk to John Quincy Adams,

42:47.740 --> 42:49.500
 right, early president of the United States

42:49.500 --> 42:51.540
 and show him what we have now,

42:51.540 --> 42:54.700
 he would think it was awful and horrible

42:54.700 --> 42:56.980
 and that somewhere along the line,

42:56.980 --> 42:59.820
 the Americans had lost their way

42:59.820 --> 43:01.780
 and forgotten what they were all about.

43:01.780 --> 43:04.860
 But we have so successfully interwoven

43:04.860 --> 43:08.340
 this modern military industrial complex

43:08.340 --> 43:11.820
 with the traditional benefits

43:11.820 --> 43:14.020
 of the American system and ideology

43:14.020 --> 43:16.100
 so that they've become intertwined in our thinking,

43:16.100 --> 43:19.260
 whereas 150 years ago, they were actually considered

43:19.260 --> 43:22.820
 to be at opposite polarities and a threat to one another.

43:22.820 --> 43:27.060
 So when you talk about the love of the nation,

43:27.060 --> 43:29.300
 I tend to be suspicious of those things.

43:29.300 --> 43:31.040
 I tend to be suspicious of government.

43:31.040 --> 43:34.540
 I tend to try very hard to not be manipulated

43:34.540 --> 43:37.680
 and I feel like a large part of what they do

43:37.680 --> 43:40.020
 is manipulation and propaganda.

43:40.020 --> 43:45.020
 And so I think a healthy skepticism of the nation state

43:45.180 --> 43:47.980
 is actually 100% Americanism

43:47.980 --> 43:50.000
 in the traditional sense of the word.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.420
 But I also have to recognize,

43:51.420 --> 43:53.980
 as you so eloquently stated,

43:53.980 --> 43:58.700
 Americanism is not necessarily universal at all.

43:58.700 --> 44:02.620
 And so I think we have to try to be more understanding.

44:02.620 --> 44:05.980
 See, the traditional American viewpoint

44:05.980 --> 44:07.460
 is that if a place like China

44:07.460 --> 44:10.280
 does not allow their people individual human rights,

44:10.280 --> 44:12.260
 then they're being denied something.

44:12.260 --> 44:14.720
 They're being denied and 100 years ago,

44:14.720 --> 44:17.180
 they would have said they're God given rights.

44:17.180 --> 44:19.400
 Man is born free and if he's not free,

44:19.400 --> 44:22.100
 it's because of something done to him, right?

44:22.100 --> 44:25.500
 The government has taken away his God given rights.

44:25.500 --> 44:27.620
 I'm getting excited just listening to that.

44:27.620 --> 44:31.260
 Well, but I mean, I think the idea that this is universal

44:31.260 --> 44:33.980
 is in and of itself a bias.

44:33.980 --> 44:36.140
 Now, do I want freedom for everybody else?

44:36.140 --> 44:36.980
 I sure do.

44:36.980 --> 44:38.220
 But the people in the Soviet Union

44:38.220 --> 44:40.220
 who really bought into that

44:40.220 --> 44:42.500
 wanted the workers of the world to unite

44:42.500 --> 44:47.060
 and not be exploited by the greedy blood sucking people

44:47.060 --> 44:50.260
 who worked them to death and pocketed all of the fruits

44:50.260 --> 44:51.460
 of their labor.

44:51.460 --> 44:52.780
 If you frame it that way,

44:52.780 --> 44:55.260
 that sounds like justice as well, you know?

44:55.260 --> 44:58.380
 So it is an eye of the beholder sort of thing.

44:58.380 --> 45:03.380
 I'd love to talk to you about Vladimir Putin,

45:03.640 --> 45:08.320
 sort of while we're in this feeling and wave of empathy

45:08.320 --> 45:11.200
 and trying to understand others that are not like us.

45:12.060 --> 45:15.120
 One of the reasons I started this podcast

45:15.120 --> 45:17.320
 is because I believe that there's a few people

45:17.320 --> 45:18.940
 I could talk to.

45:18.940 --> 45:21.060
 Some of it is ego.

45:21.060 --> 45:24.000
 Some of it is stupidity.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.500
 Is there some people I could talk to

45:26.500 --> 45:28.840
 that not many others can talk to?

45:29.700 --> 45:31.780
 The one person I was always thinking about

45:31.780 --> 45:33.660
 was Vladimir Putin.

45:33.660 --> 45:35.020
 Do you still speak the language?

45:35.020 --> 45:36.420
 I speak the language very well.

45:36.420 --> 45:37.940
 That makes it even easier.

45:37.940 --> 45:41.160
 I mean, you might be appointed for that job.

45:41.160 --> 45:43.640
 That's the context in which I'm asking you this question.

45:43.640 --> 45:48.640
 What are your thoughts about Vladimir Putin

45:48.660 --> 45:50.680
 from a historical context?

45:51.540 --> 45:52.700
 Have you studied him?

45:52.700 --> 45:54.220
 Have you thought about him?

45:54.220 --> 45:57.560
 Yes, studied is a loaded word.

45:59.340 --> 46:02.020
 And again, I find it hard sometimes

46:02.020 --> 46:05.220
 to not filter things through an American lens.

46:05.220 --> 46:07.180
 So as an American,

46:07.180 --> 46:10.240
 I would say that the Russians should be allowed

46:10.240 --> 46:12.720
 to have any leader that they want to have.

46:12.720 --> 46:15.040
 But what an American would say is,

46:15.040 --> 46:17.120
 but there should be elections, right?

46:17.120 --> 46:20.040
 So if the Russians choose Vladimir Putin

46:20.040 --> 46:23.720
 and they keep choosing him, that's their business.

46:23.720 --> 46:26.720
 Where as an American, I would have a problem

46:26.720 --> 46:29.880
 is when that leader stops letting the Russians

46:29.880 --> 46:30.900
 make that decision.

46:30.900 --> 46:33.780
 And we would say, well, now you're no longer

46:33.780 --> 46:36.420
 ruling by the consent of the governed.

46:36.420 --> 46:38.420
 You've become the equivalent of a person

46:38.420 --> 46:40.620
 who may be oppressing your people.

46:40.620 --> 46:42.800
 You might as well be a dictator, right?

46:42.800 --> 46:45.900
 Now there's a difference between a freely elected

46:45.900 --> 46:49.580
 and reelected and reelected and reelected dictator, right?

46:49.580 --> 46:50.420
 If that's what they want.

46:50.420 --> 46:54.600
 And look, it would be silly to broad brush the Russians

46:54.600 --> 46:56.760
 like it would be silly to broad brush anyone, right?

46:56.760 --> 46:57.880
 Millions and millions of people

46:57.880 --> 46:59.900
 with different opinions amongst them all.

46:59.900 --> 47:03.260
 But they seem to like a strong person at the helm.

47:03.260 --> 47:05.340
 And listen, there's a giant chunk of Americans

47:05.340 --> 47:08.260
 who do too in their own country.

47:08.260 --> 47:12.300
 But an American would say, as long as the freedom of choice

47:12.300 --> 47:15.140
 is given to the Russians to decide this

47:15.140 --> 47:16.980
 and not taken away from them, right?

47:16.980 --> 47:18.580
 It's one thing to say he was freely elected,

47:18.580 --> 47:20.580
 but a long time ago and we've done away with elections

47:20.580 --> 47:23.300
 since then is a different story too.

47:23.300 --> 47:25.580
 So my attitude on Vladimir Putin

47:25.580 --> 47:27.500
 is if that's who the Russian people want

47:27.500 --> 47:29.340
 and you give them the choice, right?

47:29.340 --> 47:31.580
 If he's only there because they keep electing him,

47:31.580 --> 47:32.740
 that's a very different story.

47:32.740 --> 47:36.420
 When he stops offering them the option

47:36.420 --> 47:38.220
 of choosing him or not choosing him,

47:38.220 --> 47:40.060
 that's when it begins to look nefarious

47:40.060 --> 47:42.900
 to someone born and raised with the mindset

47:42.900 --> 47:46.260
 and the ideology that is an integral part of yours truly.

47:46.260 --> 47:48.700
 And that I can't, you can see gray areas

47:48.700 --> 47:51.380
 and nuance all you like, but it's hard to escape.

47:51.380 --> 47:52.960
 And you alluded to this too.

47:52.960 --> 47:56.380
 It's hard to escape what was indoctrinated

47:56.380 --> 47:59.260
 into your bones in your formative years.

47:59.260 --> 48:02.220
 It's like, your bones are growing, right?

48:02.220 --> 48:03.700
 And you can't go back.

48:03.700 --> 48:06.340
 So to me, this is so much a part of who I am

48:06.340 --> 48:09.360
 that I have a hard time jettisoning that and saying,

48:09.360 --> 48:11.700
 oh no, Vladimir Putin not being elected anymore,

48:11.700 --> 48:12.900
 it's just fine.

48:12.900 --> 48:16.780
 I'm too much of a product of my upbringing to go there.

48:16.780 --> 48:17.620
 Does that make sense?

48:17.620 --> 48:18.460
 Yeah, absolutely.

48:18.460 --> 48:20.160
 But of course there's, like we were saying,

48:20.160 --> 48:23.820
 there's gray areas, which is, I believe,

48:23.820 --> 48:24.980
 I have to think through this,

48:24.980 --> 48:28.420
 but I think there is a point at which Adolf Hitler

48:28.420 --> 48:32.940
 became the popular choice in Nazi Germany in the 30s.

48:32.940 --> 48:37.660
 There's a, in the same way, from an American perspective,

48:37.660 --> 48:42.660
 you can start to criticize some in a shallow way,

48:42.860 --> 48:43.940
 some in a deep way.

48:43.940 --> 48:47.360
 The way that Putin has maintained power

48:47.360 --> 48:48.620
 is by controlling the press.

48:48.620 --> 48:51.320
 So limiting one other freedom that we Americans value,

48:51.320 --> 48:55.040
 which is the freedom of the press or freedom of speech

48:55.040 --> 48:57.740
 that he, it is very possible.

48:57.740 --> 49:00.360
 Now things are changing now,

49:00.360 --> 49:03.260
 but for most of his presidency,

49:03.260 --> 49:06.780
 he was the popular choice and sometimes by far.

49:06.780 --> 49:11.780
 And I have, I actually don't have real family in Russia

49:12.580 --> 49:14.120
 who don't love Putin.

49:15.020 --> 49:17.820
 The only people who write to me about Putin

49:17.820 --> 49:22.380
 and not liking him are like sort of activists

49:22.380 --> 49:24.740
 who are young, right?

49:24.740 --> 49:26.900
 But like to me, they're strangers.

49:26.900 --> 49:28.300
 I don't know anything about them.

49:28.300 --> 49:31.140
 The people I do know who have a big family in Russia,

49:32.300 --> 49:34.980
 they love Putin.

49:34.980 --> 49:35.820
 They...

49:35.820 --> 49:37.140
 Do they miss elections?

49:41.860 --> 49:45.940
 Would they want the choice to prove it at the ballot box?

49:45.940 --> 49:49.920
 And, or are they so in love with him

49:49.920 --> 49:52.440
 that they wouldn't wanna take a chance

49:52.440 --> 49:54.540
 that someone might vote him out?

49:54.540 --> 49:56.220
 No, they don't think of it this way.

49:56.220 --> 50:00.300
 And they are aware of the incredible bureaucracy

50:00.300 --> 50:03.520
 and corruption that is lurking in the shadows,

50:03.520 --> 50:05.540
 which is true in Russia.

50:05.540 --> 50:06.640
 Everywhere.

50:06.640 --> 50:07.480
 Everywhere.

50:07.480 --> 50:09.700
 But like, there's something about the Russian,

50:09.700 --> 50:14.520
 it's a remnants, corruption is so deeply part of the Russian,

50:14.520 --> 50:18.540
 so the Soviet system that even the overthrow of the Soviet,

50:18.540 --> 50:21.900
 the breaking apart of the Soviet Union

50:21.900 --> 50:26.900
 and Putin coming and reforming a lot of the system,

50:27.100 --> 50:28.980
 it's still deeply in there.

50:28.980 --> 50:31.000
 And they're aware of that.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.300
 That's part of the, like the love for Putin

50:33.300 --> 50:38.060
 is partially grounded in the fear of what happens

50:38.060 --> 50:42.100
 when the corrupt take over, the greedy take over.

50:42.100 --> 50:44.940
 And they see Putin as the stabilizer,

50:44.940 --> 50:49.380
 as like a hard like force that says...

50:49.380 --> 50:50.380
 A counter force.

50:50.380 --> 50:53.020
 Counter force that get your shit together.

50:53.020 --> 50:56.180
 Like basically, from the Western perspective,

50:56.180 --> 51:01.180
 Putin is terrible, but from the Russian perspective,

51:01.820 --> 51:04.580
 Putin is the only thing holding this thing together

51:04.580 --> 51:07.340
 before it goes, if it collapses.

51:07.340 --> 51:11.780
 Now, from the, like Gary Kasparov has been loud on this,

51:11.780 --> 51:14.540
 a lot of people from the Western perspective say,

51:14.540 --> 51:17.300
 well, if it has to collapse, let it collapse.

51:17.300 --> 51:18.140
 You know, that's...

51:18.140 --> 51:18.980
 That's easier said than done

51:18.980 --> 51:20.140
 when you don't have to live through that.

51:20.140 --> 51:21.180
 Exactly.

51:21.180 --> 51:23.940
 And so anyone worrying about their family about...

51:23.940 --> 51:28.860
 And they also remember the inflation

51:28.860 --> 51:30.420
 and the economic instability

51:30.420 --> 51:31.920
 and the suffering and the starvation

51:31.920 --> 51:33.700
 that happened in the 90s with the collapse

51:33.700 --> 51:35.100
 of the Soviet Union.

51:35.100 --> 51:36.940
 And they saw the kind of reform

51:36.940 --> 51:39.060
 and the economic vibrancy that happened

51:39.060 --> 51:40.500
 when Putin took power,

51:40.500 --> 51:43.480
 that they think like, this guy's holding it together.

51:43.480 --> 51:48.480
 And they see elections as potentially

51:48.480 --> 51:53.080
 being mechanisms by which the corrupt people

51:53.080 --> 51:55.280
 can manipulate the system unfairly,

51:55.280 --> 51:58.160
 as opposed to letting the people speak with their voice.

51:58.160 --> 52:03.120
 They somehow figure out a way to manipulate the elections,

52:03.120 --> 52:08.120
 to elect somebody like one of them Western revolutionaries.

52:08.160 --> 52:11.600
 And so I think one of the beliefs

52:11.600 --> 52:13.580
 that's important to the American system

52:13.580 --> 52:17.880
 is the belief in the electoral system

52:17.880 --> 52:20.400
 that the voice of the people can be heard

52:20.400 --> 52:22.480
 in the various systems of government,

52:22.480 --> 52:24.480
 whether it's judicial, whether it's...

52:25.920 --> 52:29.080
 I mean, basically the assumption is

52:29.080 --> 52:31.600
 that the system works well enough

52:31.600 --> 52:36.600
 for you to be able to elect the popular choice.

52:36.760 --> 52:38.620
 Okay, so there's a couple of things

52:38.620 --> 52:40.660
 that come to mind on that.

52:40.660 --> 52:45.400
 The first one has to do with the idea of oligarchs.

52:45.400 --> 52:48.240
 There's a belief in political science,

52:48.240 --> 52:50.420
 you know, it's not the overall belief,

52:50.420 --> 52:53.560
 but that every society is sort of an oligarchy really,

52:53.560 --> 52:55.340
 if you break it down, right?

52:55.340 --> 52:57.800
 So what you're talking about are some of the people

52:57.800 --> 53:02.720
 who would form an oligarchic class in Russia,

53:02.720 --> 53:06.240
 and that Putin is the guy who can harness

53:06.240 --> 53:10.040
 the power of the state to keep those people in check.

53:10.040 --> 53:12.360
 The problem, of course, in a system like that,

53:12.360 --> 53:13.920
 a strong man system, right?

53:13.920 --> 53:16.520
 Where you have somebody who can hold the reins

53:16.520 --> 53:20.280
 and steer the ship when the ship is violently in a storm,

53:20.280 --> 53:21.860
 is the succession.

53:21.860 --> 53:25.180
 So if you're not creating a system

53:25.180 --> 53:27.640
 that can operate without you,

53:27.640 --> 53:31.720
 then that terrible instability and that terrible future

53:31.720 --> 53:35.200
 that you justify the strong man for

53:35.200 --> 53:37.480
 is just awaiting your future, right?

53:37.480 --> 53:41.380
 I mean, unless he's actively building the system

53:41.380 --> 53:44.720
 that will outlive him and allow successors

53:44.720 --> 53:46.480
 to do what he's doing,

53:46.480 --> 53:49.040
 then what you've done here is create a temporary,

53:49.040 --> 53:51.040
 I would think, a temporary stability here,

53:51.040 --> 53:54.120
 because it's the same problem you have in a monarchy, right?

53:54.120 --> 53:57.480
 Where you have this one king and he's particularly good,

53:57.480 --> 53:59.340
 or you think he's particularly good,

53:59.340 --> 54:00.760
 but he's gonna turn that job over

54:00.760 --> 54:02.680
 to somebody else down the road,

54:02.680 --> 54:04.320
 and the system doesn't guarantee

54:04.320 --> 54:07.480
 because no one's really worked on,

54:07.480 --> 54:08.920
 and again, you would tell me,

54:08.920 --> 54:11.120
 if Putin is putting into place,

54:11.120 --> 54:13.080
 I know he's talked about it over the years,

54:13.080 --> 54:15.800
 putting into place a system that can outlive him

54:15.800 --> 54:17.320
 and that will create the stability

54:17.320 --> 54:21.640
 that the people in Russia like him for when he's gone,

54:21.640 --> 54:24.000
 because if the oligarchs just take over afterwards,

54:24.000 --> 54:25.640
 then one might argue,

54:25.640 --> 54:28.180
 well, we had 20 good years of stability,

54:28.180 --> 54:29.280
 but I mean, I would say

54:29.280 --> 54:32.560
 that if we're talking about a ship of state here,

54:32.560 --> 54:34.100
 the guy steering the ship, maybe,

54:34.100 --> 54:35.760
 if you wanted to look at it from the Russian point of view,

54:35.760 --> 54:38.320
 has done a great job, maybe, just saying,

54:38.320 --> 54:39.920
 but the rocks are still out there,

54:39.920 --> 54:42.520
 and he's not going to be at the helm forever,

54:42.520 --> 54:45.000
 so one would think that his job is to make sure

54:45.000 --> 54:47.460
 that there's going to be someone

54:47.460 --> 54:49.040
 who can continue to steer the ship

54:49.040 --> 54:51.340
 for the people of Russia after he's gone.

54:51.340 --> 54:53.440
 Now, let me ask, because I'm curious,

54:55.160 --> 54:58.960
 and ignorant, so is he doing that, do you think?

54:58.960 --> 55:02.240
 Is he setting it up so that when there is no Putin,

55:02.240 --> 55:04.000
 the state is safe?

55:04.000 --> 55:06.960
 From the beginning, that was the idea,

55:06.960 --> 55:09.240
 whether one of the fascinating things,

55:09.240 --> 55:10.680
 now, I read every biography,

55:10.680 --> 55:12.760
 English written biography on Putin,

55:12.760 --> 55:16.420
 so I need to think more deeply,

55:16.420 --> 55:17.680
 but one of the fascinating things

55:17.680 --> 55:20.940
 is how did power change Vladimir Putin?

55:20.940 --> 55:24.400
 He was a different man when he took power than he is today.

55:24.400 --> 55:29.400
 I actually, in many ways, admire the man that took power.

55:29.720 --> 55:33.160
 I think he's very different than Stalin and then Hitler

55:33.160 --> 55:34.920
 at the moment they took power.

55:34.920 --> 55:39.160
 I think Hitler and Stalin were both,

55:39.160 --> 55:41.080
 in our previous discussion,

55:41.080 --> 55:44.000
 already on the trajectory of evil.

55:44.000 --> 55:49.000
 I think Putin was a humble, loyal, honest man

55:49.400 --> 55:50.760
 when he took power.

55:50.760 --> 55:54.560
 The man he is today is worth thinking about and studying.

55:54.560 --> 55:56.560
 I'm not sure that that.

55:56.560 --> 55:57.520
 That's an old line, though,

55:57.520 --> 55:59.800
 about absolute power corrupting, absolutely.

55:59.800 --> 56:02.780
 But it's kind of a line.

56:02.780 --> 56:05.500
 It's a beautiful quote,

56:05.500 --> 56:07.780
 but you have to really think about it.

56:07.780 --> 56:10.420
 Like, what does that actually mean?

56:10.420 --> 56:13.500
 Like, one of the things I still have to do,

56:13.500 --> 56:15.740
 I've been focusing on securing the conversation, right?

56:15.740 --> 56:18.980
 So I haven't gone through a dark place yet

56:18.980 --> 56:21.820
 because I feel like I can't do the dark thing for too long.

56:21.820 --> 56:25.220
 So I really have to put myself in the mind of Putin

56:26.260 --> 56:27.920
 leading up to the conversation.

56:27.920 --> 56:32.820
 But for now, my sense is he took power

56:32.820 --> 56:34.700
 when Yeltsin gave him,

56:34.700 --> 56:38.300
 one of the big sort of acts of the new Russia

56:38.300 --> 56:42.040
 was for the first time in its history,

56:42.040 --> 56:45.940
 a leader could have continued being in power

56:45.940 --> 56:48.120
 and chose to give away power.

56:48.120 --> 56:49.740
 That was the George Washington.

56:49.740 --> 56:50.820
 Right, we in the United States

56:50.820 --> 56:52.860
 would look at that as absolute positive, yeah.

56:52.860 --> 56:54.420
 A sign of good things, yes.

56:54.420 --> 56:56.100
 And so that was a huge act.

56:56.100 --> 57:00.980
 And Putin said that that was the defining thing

57:00.980 --> 57:03.580
 that will define Russia for the 21st century,

57:03.580 --> 57:07.220
 that act, and he will carry that flag forward.

57:07.220 --> 57:12.140
 That's why in rhetoric, he, after two terms,

57:12.140 --> 57:13.180
 he gave away power.

57:13.180 --> 57:15.300
 To Medvedev, but it was a puppet, right?

57:15.300 --> 57:17.940
 Yeah, yes, but it was,

57:17.940 --> 57:20.700
 but like still the story was being told.

57:20.700 --> 57:23.460
 I think he believed it early on.

57:23.460 --> 57:28.260
 I think he, I believe he still believes it,

57:28.260 --> 57:30.500
 but I think he's deeply suspicious

57:30.500 --> 57:33.140
 of the corruption that lurks in the shadows.

57:33.140 --> 57:34.860
 And I do believe that,

57:34.860 --> 57:38.180
 like as somebody who thinks clickbait journalism is broken,

57:38.180 --> 57:40.140
 journalists annoy the hell out of me.

57:40.140 --> 57:42.340
 Clickbait journalism's working perfectly.

57:42.340 --> 57:43.660
 Journalism's broken.

57:43.660 --> 57:44.500
 Journalism.

57:44.500 --> 57:45.320
 Clickbait thing's working great.

57:45.320 --> 57:46.700
 Exactly.

57:46.700 --> 57:49.780
 So I understand from Putin's perspective

57:49.780 --> 57:52.840
 that journalism, journalists can be seen

57:52.840 --> 57:53.940
 as the enemy of the state,

57:53.940 --> 57:57.800
 because people think journalists write these deep,

57:57.800 --> 57:59.660
 beautiful philosophical pieces

57:59.660 --> 58:02.300
 about criticizing the structure of government

58:02.300 --> 58:04.740
 and the proper policy where, you know,

58:04.740 --> 58:07.820
 the steps that we need to take to make a greater nation.

58:07.820 --> 58:11.340
 No, they, they're unfairly take stuff out of context.

58:11.340 --> 58:13.860
 They, they're critical in ways

58:13.860 --> 58:16.580
 that's like shallow and not interesting.

58:16.580 --> 58:19.740
 They, they call you a racist or sexist,

58:19.740 --> 58:22.540
 or they make up stuff all the time.

58:22.540 --> 58:25.420
 So I can put myself in the mindset of a person

58:25.420 --> 58:28.420
 that thinks that it is okay to remove

58:28.420 --> 58:33.420
 that kind of shallow fake news voice from the system.

58:34.020 --> 58:36.900
 The problem is, of course, that is a slippery slope

58:36.900 --> 58:41.080
 to then you remove all the annoying people from the system,

58:41.080 --> 58:43.240
 and then you change what annoying means,

58:43.240 --> 58:45.240
 which annoying starts becoming a thing

58:45.240 --> 58:48.780
 that like anyone who opposes the system.

58:48.780 --> 58:53.020
 I mean, I get, I get the slippery,

58:53.020 --> 58:55.300
 it's obvious that it becomes a slippery slope,

58:55.300 --> 58:57.220
 but I can also put myself in the mindset

58:57.220 --> 58:59.340
 of the people that see it's okay

58:59.340 --> 59:02.260
 to remove the liars from the system,

59:02.260 --> 59:04.280
 as long as it's good for Russia.

59:04.280 --> 59:06.460
 And, okay, so herein lies, and this again,

59:06.460 --> 59:08.460
 the traditional American perspective,

59:08.460 --> 59:11.260
 because we've had yellow, so called yellow journalism

59:11.260 --> 59:12.620
 since the founding of the Republic.

59:12.620 --> 59:14.220
 That's nothing new.

59:14.220 --> 59:16.900
 But, but the problem then comes into play,

59:16.900 --> 59:20.100
 when you remove journalists, even, you know,

59:20.100 --> 59:21.260
 it's a broad brush thing,

59:21.260 --> 59:24.740
 because you remove both the crappy ones who are lying,

59:24.740 --> 59:26.500
 and the ones who are telling the truth too,

59:26.500 --> 59:31.060
 you're left with simply the approved government journalists,

59:31.060 --> 59:34.020
 right, the ones who are towing the government's line,

59:34.020 --> 59:37.220
 in which case the truth as you see it

59:37.220 --> 59:39.240
 is a different kind of fake news, right?

59:39.240 --> 59:41.380
 It's the fake news from the government,

59:41.380 --> 59:43.340
 instead of the clickbait news,

59:43.340 --> 59:46.500
 and oh yeah, maybe truth mixed into all that too,

59:46.500 --> 59:48.020
 in some of the outlets.

59:48.020 --> 59:49.700
 The problem I always have with our system

59:49.700 --> 59:50.920
 here in the United States right now

59:50.920 --> 59:55.540
 is trying to tease the truth out from all the falsehoods.

59:55.540 --> 59:58.660
 And look, I've got 30 years in journalism.

59:58.660 --> 1:00:01.020
 My job used to be to go through, before the internet,

1:00:01.020 --> 1:00:03.220
 all the newspapers, and find the,

1:00:03.220 --> 1:00:05.100
 I used to know all the journalists by name,

1:00:05.100 --> 1:00:06.860
 and I could pick out, you know, who they were,

1:00:06.860 --> 1:00:11.020
 and I have a hard time picking out the truth

1:00:11.020 --> 1:00:13.380
 from the falsehoods, so I think constantly,

1:00:13.380 --> 1:00:16.460
 how are people who don't have all this background,

1:00:16.460 --> 1:00:19.100
 who have lives, or who are trained in other specialties,

1:00:19.100 --> 1:00:20.500
 how do they do it?

1:00:20.500 --> 1:00:24.540
 But if the government is the only approved outlet for truth,

1:00:25.380 --> 1:00:26.600
 a traditional American,

1:00:26.600 --> 1:00:28.260
 and a lot of other traditional societies

1:00:28.260 --> 1:00:29.940
 based on these ideas of the Enlightenment

1:00:29.940 --> 1:00:31.220
 that I talked about earlier,

1:00:31.220 --> 1:00:33.440
 would see that as a disaster waiting to happen,

1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:35.120
 or a tyranny in progress.

1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:35.960
 Does that make sense?

1:00:35.960 --> 1:00:37.440
 Oh, it totally makes sense,

1:00:37.440 --> 1:00:40.140
 and I would agree with you, I still agree with you,

1:00:40.140 --> 1:00:43.860
 but it is clear that something about the freedom

1:00:43.860 --> 1:00:47.460
 of the press and freedom of speech in today,

1:00:47.460 --> 1:00:49.580
 like literally the last few years

1:00:49.580 --> 1:00:52.380
 with the internet is changing,

1:00:52.380 --> 1:00:53.860
 and the argument, you know,

1:00:53.860 --> 1:00:55.980
 you could say that the American system

1:00:55.980 --> 1:00:59.340
 of freedom of speech is broken,

1:00:59.340 --> 1:01:04.160
 because the, here's the belief I grew up on,

1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:07.740
 and I still hold, but I'm starting to be sort of

1:01:07.740 --> 1:01:09.660
 trying to see multiple views on it.

1:01:09.660 --> 1:01:14.340
 My belief was that freedom of speech results

1:01:14.340 --> 1:01:18.180
 in a stable trajectory towards truth always.

1:01:18.180 --> 1:01:19.900
 So like truth will emerge.

1:01:19.900 --> 1:01:21.660
 That was my sort of faith and belief

1:01:21.660 --> 1:01:24.820
 that yeah, there's going to be lies all over the place,

1:01:24.820 --> 1:01:27.820
 but there'll be like a stable thing that is true,

1:01:27.820 --> 1:01:31.620
 that's carried forward to the public.

1:01:31.620 --> 1:01:36.620
 Now it feels like it's possible to go towards a world

1:01:36.620 --> 1:01:39.740
 where nothing is true,

1:01:39.740 --> 1:01:44.700
 where truth is something that groups of people

1:01:44.700 --> 1:01:45.900
 convince themselves of,

1:01:45.900 --> 1:01:48.020
 and there's multiple groups of people,

1:01:48.020 --> 1:01:51.220
 and the idea of some universal truth,

1:01:51.220 --> 1:01:53.220
 as I suppose is the better thing,

1:01:53.220 --> 1:01:57.320
 is something that we can no longer exist under.

1:01:57.320 --> 1:02:00.460
 Like some people believe that the Green Bay Packers

1:02:00.460 --> 1:02:02.600
 is the best football team,

1:02:02.600 --> 1:02:04.860
 and some people can think the Patriots,

1:02:04.860 --> 1:02:07.940
 and they deeply believe it

1:02:07.940 --> 1:02:10.260
 to where they call the other groups liars.

1:02:10.260 --> 1:02:11.540
 Now that's fun for sports,

1:02:11.540 --> 1:02:14.660
 that's fun for favorite flavors of ice cream,

1:02:14.660 --> 1:02:17.220
 but they might believe that about science,

1:02:17.220 --> 1:02:22.220
 about the various aspects of politics,

1:02:23.780 --> 1:02:28.200
 various aspects of sort of different policies

1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:30.660
 within the function of our government.

1:02:30.660 --> 1:02:32.700
 And like, that's not just like

1:02:32.700 --> 1:02:34.220
 some weird thing we'll complain about,

1:02:34.220 --> 1:02:35.620
 but that'll be the nature of things,

1:02:35.620 --> 1:02:38.740
 like truth is something we can no longer have.

1:02:38.740 --> 1:02:41.320
 Well, and let me de romanticize

1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:43.920
 the American history of this too,

1:02:43.920 --> 1:02:48.920
 because the American press was often just as biased,

1:02:49.100 --> 1:02:52.480
 just as, I mean, I always looked to the 1970s

1:02:52.480 --> 1:02:55.740
 as the high watermark of the American journalistic,

1:02:55.740 --> 1:02:57.860
 in the post Watergate era,

1:02:57.860 --> 1:03:02.860
 where it was actively going after the abuses

1:03:02.860 --> 1:03:04.240
 of the government and all these things.

1:03:04.240 --> 1:03:06.460
 But there was a famous speech, very quiet though,

1:03:06.460 --> 1:03:08.660
 very quiet, given by Katherine Graham,

1:03:08.660 --> 1:03:11.400
 who was a Washington Post editor, I believe.

1:03:11.400 --> 1:03:13.400
 And I actually, somebody sent it to me,

1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:15.160
 we had to get it off of a journalism,

1:03:15.160 --> 1:03:16.880
 like a J store kind of thing.

1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:19.800
 And she, at a luncheon,

1:03:20.800 --> 1:03:23.760
 assured to the government people at the luncheon,

1:03:23.760 --> 1:03:25.700
 don't worry, this is not gonna be something

1:03:25.700 --> 1:03:27.640
 that we make a trend.

1:03:27.640 --> 1:03:31.680
 Because the position of the government

1:03:31.680 --> 1:03:34.840
 is still something that was carried,

1:03:34.840 --> 1:03:36.440
 that the newspapers were the water,

1:03:36.440 --> 1:03:37.760
 and the newspapers were the big thing

1:03:37.760 --> 1:03:40.500
 up until certainly the late 60s, early 70s.

1:03:40.500 --> 1:03:42.760
 The newspapers were still the water carrier

1:03:42.760 --> 1:03:43.960
 of the government, right?

1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:45.680
 And they were the water carriers

1:03:45.680 --> 1:03:47.740
 of the owners of the newspaper.

1:03:47.740 --> 1:03:51.000
 So let's not pretend there was some angelic, wonderful time.

1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:52.000
 And I'm saying to me,

1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:53.680
 cause I was the one who brought it up,

1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:56.860
 let's not pretend there was any super age

1:03:56.860 --> 1:03:58.580
 of truthful journalism and all that.

1:03:58.580 --> 1:04:01.000
 And I mean, you go to the revolutionary period

1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:02.280
 in American history,

1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:05.000
 and it looks every bit as bad as today, right?

1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:06.440
 That's a hopeful message, actually.

1:04:06.440 --> 1:04:09.120
 So things may not be as bad as they look.

1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:11.180
 Well, let's look at it more like a stock market,

1:04:11.180 --> 1:04:14.080
 and that you have fluctuations in the truthfulness

1:04:14.080 --> 1:04:16.080
 or believability of the press.

1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:18.520
 And there are periods where it was higher

1:04:18.520 --> 1:04:19.920
 than other periods.

1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:22.240
 The funny thing about the so called clickbait era,

1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:24.260
 and I do think it's terrible,

1:04:24.260 --> 1:04:27.840
 but I mean, it resembles earlier eras to me.

1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:30.320
 So I always compare it to when I was a kid growing up,

1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:33.840
 when I thought journalism was as good as it's ever gotten.

1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:34.980
 It was never perfect.

1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:39.400
 But it's also something that you see very rarely

1:04:39.400 --> 1:04:41.300
 in other governments around the world.

1:04:41.300 --> 1:04:42.840
 And there's a reason that journalists

1:04:42.840 --> 1:04:46.600
 are often killed regularly in a lot of countries.

1:04:46.600 --> 1:04:48.300
 And it's because they report on things

1:04:48.300 --> 1:04:50.160
 that the authorities do not want reported on.

1:04:50.160 --> 1:04:51.000
 And I've always thought that

1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:52.960
 that was what journalism should do.

1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:55.080
 But it's gotta be truthful,

1:04:55.080 --> 1:04:59.080
 otherwise it's just a different kind of propaganda, right?

1:04:59.080 --> 1:05:01.360
 Can we talk about Genghis Khan?

1:05:01.360 --> 1:05:02.200
 Genghis Khan?

1:05:02.200 --> 1:05:03.020
 Sure.

1:05:03.020 --> 1:05:05.680
 By the way, is it Genghis Khan or Genghis Khan?

1:05:05.680 --> 1:05:06.680
 It's not Genghis Khan.

1:05:06.680 --> 1:05:09.200
 It's either Genghis Khan or Chinggis Khan.

1:05:09.200 --> 1:05:11.240
 So let's go with Genghis Khan.

1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:12.640
 That's the only thing I'll be able to say

1:05:12.640 --> 1:05:15.640
 with any certain, last certain thing I'll say about it.

1:05:16.600 --> 1:05:18.920
 It's like, I don't know, GIF versus GIF.

1:05:20.080 --> 1:05:21.120
 I don't know if you know about those things.

1:05:21.120 --> 1:05:23.800
 I don't know how it ever got started the wrong way.

1:05:23.800 --> 1:05:24.920
 Yeah.

1:05:24.920 --> 1:05:28.840
 So first of all, your episodes on Genghis Khan

1:05:28.840 --> 1:05:31.000
 for many people are the favorite.

1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:33.520
 It's fascinating to think about events

1:05:33.520 --> 1:05:36.040
 that had so much like in their ripples,

1:05:36.040 --> 1:05:40.440
 had so much impact on so much of human civilization.

1:05:40.440 --> 1:05:45.120
 In your view, was he an evil man?

1:05:45.120 --> 1:05:47.020
 Let's go start a discussion of evil.

1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:53.000
 Another way to put it is I've read he's much loved

1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:56.560
 in many parts of the world like Mongolia.

1:05:56.560 --> 1:05:59.200
 And I've also read arguments that say

1:05:59.200 --> 1:06:02.160
 that he was quite a progressive for the time.

1:06:03.040 --> 1:06:04.240
 So where do you put him?

1:06:04.240 --> 1:06:08.440
 Is he a progressive or is he an evil destroyer of humans?

1:06:08.440 --> 1:06:10.440
 As I often say, I'm not a historian,

1:06:10.440 --> 1:06:13.580
 which is why what I try to bring

1:06:13.580 --> 1:06:17.680
 to the Hardcore History podcasts are these sub themes.

1:06:17.680 --> 1:06:19.400
 So each show has, and they're not,

1:06:19.400 --> 1:06:21.040
 I try to kind of soft pedal them.

1:06:21.040 --> 1:06:23.040
 So they're not always like really right in front

1:06:23.040 --> 1:06:23.880
 of your face.

1:06:23.880 --> 1:06:28.640
 In that episode, the soft peddling sub theme had to do

1:06:28.640 --> 1:06:32.360
 with what we referred to as a historical arsonist.

1:06:32.360 --> 1:06:36.200
 And it's because some historians have taken the position

1:06:36.200 --> 1:06:38.600
 that sometimes, and most of this is earlier stuff,

1:06:38.600 --> 1:06:40.440
 historians don't do this very much anymore,

1:06:40.440 --> 1:06:43.160
 but these were the wonderful questions I grew up with

1:06:43.160 --> 1:06:45.640
 that blend, it's almost the intersection

1:06:45.640 --> 1:06:48.180
 between history and philosophy.

1:06:48.180 --> 1:06:52.440
 And the idea was that sometimes the world has become

1:06:52.440 --> 1:06:56.800
 so overwhelmed with bureaucracy or corruption

1:06:56.800 --> 1:07:00.760
 or just stagnation that somebody has to come in

1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:03.920
 or some group of people or some force has to come in

1:07:03.920 --> 1:07:06.240
 and do the equivalent of a forest fire

1:07:06.240 --> 1:07:08.380
 to clear out all the dead wood

1:07:08.380 --> 1:07:11.040
 so that the forest itself can be rejuvenated

1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:13.160
 and society can then move forward.

1:07:13.160 --> 1:07:15.620
 And there's a lot of these periods where the historians

1:07:15.620 --> 1:07:18.840
 of the past will portray these figures who come in

1:07:18.840 --> 1:07:23.400
 and do horrific things as creating an almost service

1:07:23.400 --> 1:07:25.440
 for mankind, right?

1:07:25.440 --> 1:07:28.520
 Creating the foundations for a new world

1:07:28.520 --> 1:07:29.880
 that will be better than the old one.

1:07:29.880 --> 1:07:31.000
 And it's a recurring theme.

1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:34.440
 And so this was the sub theme of the Khan's podcast,

1:07:34.440 --> 1:07:36.240
 because otherwise you don't need me to tell you the story

1:07:36.240 --> 1:07:37.960
 of the Mongols, but I'm gonna bring up

1:07:37.960 --> 1:07:40.240
 the historical arsonist element.

1:07:40.240 --> 1:07:43.560
 And, but this gets to how the Khan has been portrayed,

1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:44.380
 right?

1:07:44.380 --> 1:07:46.800
 If you wanna say, oh yes, he cleared out the dead wood

1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:49.400
 and made for, well, then it's a positive thing.

1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:52.720
 If you say, my family was in the forest fire that he set,

1:07:52.720 --> 1:07:54.420
 you're not gonna see it that way.

1:07:55.720 --> 1:07:58.260
 Much of what Genghis Khan is credited with

1:07:58.260 --> 1:07:59.840
 on the upside, right?

1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:02.800
 So things like religious toleration,

1:08:02.800 --> 1:08:05.160
 and you'll say, well, he was religiously,

1:08:05.160 --> 1:08:08.040
 the Mongols were religiously tolerant.

1:08:08.040 --> 1:08:10.600
 And so this makes them almost like a liberal reformer

1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:11.500
 kind of thing.

1:08:11.500 --> 1:08:14.280
 But this needs to be seen within the context

1:08:14.280 --> 1:08:17.560
 of their empire, which was very much

1:08:17.560 --> 1:08:18.640
 like the Roman viewpoint,

1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:20.640
 which is the Romans didn't care at a lot of time

1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:22.720
 what your local people worshiped.

1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:24.280
 They wanted stability.

1:08:24.280 --> 1:08:26.880
 And if that kept stability and kept you paying taxes

1:08:26.880 --> 1:08:29.440
 and didn't require the legionaries to come in,

1:08:29.440 --> 1:08:31.300
 then they didn't care, right?

1:08:31.300 --> 1:08:32.960
 And the Khans were the same way.

1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:34.600
 Like they don't care what you're practicing

1:08:34.600 --> 1:08:36.440
 as long as it doesn't disrupt their empire

1:08:36.440 --> 1:08:37.980
 and cause them trouble.

1:08:37.980 --> 1:08:39.820
 But what I always like to point out is yes,

1:08:39.820 --> 1:08:42.360
 but the Khan could still come in with his representatives

1:08:42.360 --> 1:08:45.240
 to your town, decide your daughter was a beautiful woman

1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:47.280
 that they wanted in the Khan's concubine,

1:08:47.280 --> 1:08:48.800
 and they would take them.

1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:52.440
 So how liberal an empire is this, right?

1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:54.720
 So many of the things that they get credit for

1:08:54.720 --> 1:08:56.880
 as though there's some kind of nice guys

1:08:56.880 --> 1:08:58.840
 may in another way of looking at it

1:08:58.840 --> 1:09:01.760
 just be a simple mechanism of control, right?

1:09:01.760 --> 1:09:04.760
 A way to keep the empire stable.

1:09:04.760 --> 1:09:07.160
 They're not doing it out of the goodness of their heart.

1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:09.120
 They have decided that this is the best.

1:09:09.120 --> 1:09:13.360
 And I love because the Mongols were what we would call

1:09:13.360 --> 1:09:15.240
 a pagan people now.

1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:17.880
 I love the fact that they, and I think we call it,

1:09:17.880 --> 1:09:19.760
 I forgot the term we used, had to do with,

1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:22.360
 like they were hedging their bets religiously, right?

1:09:22.360 --> 1:09:24.440
 They didn't know which God was the right one.

1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:27.400
 So as long as you're all praying for the health of the Khan,

1:09:27.400 --> 1:09:30.440
 we're maximizing the chances that whoever the gods are,

1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:32.440
 they get the message, right?

1:09:32.440 --> 1:09:34.960
 So I think it's been portrayed as something

1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:36.440
 like a liberal empire.

1:09:36.440 --> 1:09:40.720
 And the idea of Mongol universality

1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:43.680
 is more about conquering the world.

1:09:43.680 --> 1:09:44.600
 And it's like saying, you know,

1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:46.680
 we're gonna bring stability to the world by conquering it.

1:09:46.680 --> 1:09:48.720
 Well, what if that's Hitler, right?

1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:50.160
 He could make the same case,

1:09:50.160 --> 1:09:52.240
 or Hitler wasn't really the world conqueror like that

1:09:52.240 --> 1:09:54.040
 because he wouldn't have been trying

1:09:54.040 --> 1:09:55.640
 to make it equal for all peoples.

1:09:55.640 --> 1:09:58.300
 But my point being that it kind of takes

1:09:58.300 --> 1:10:01.520
 the positive moral slant out of it

1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:05.120
 if their motivation wasn't a positive moral slant

1:10:05.120 --> 1:10:09.720
 to the motivate, and the Mongols didn't see it that way.

1:10:09.720 --> 1:10:13.140
 And I think the way that it's portrayed is like,

1:10:13.140 --> 1:10:15.200
 and I always like to use this analogy,

1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:17.480
 but it's like shooting an arrow

1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:20.300
 and painting a bull's eye around it afterwards, right?

1:10:20.300 --> 1:10:24.680
 How do we justify and make them look good in a way

1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:26.120
 that they themselves probably,

1:10:26.120 --> 1:10:29.780
 and listen, we don't have the Mongol point of view per se.

1:10:29.780 --> 1:10:31.360
 I mean, there's something called the secret history

1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:33.660
 of the Mongols, and there's things written down

1:10:33.660 --> 1:10:36.160
 by Mongolian overlords through people

1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:38.580
 like Persian and Chinese scribes later.

1:10:38.580 --> 1:10:41.100
 We don't have their point of view,

1:10:41.100 --> 1:10:44.000
 but it sure doesn't look like this was an attempt

1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:45.820
 to create some wonderful place

1:10:45.820 --> 1:10:47.560
 where everybody was living a better life

1:10:47.560 --> 1:10:48.560
 than they were before.

1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:53.560
 I think that's later people putting a nice rosy spin on it.

1:10:53.920 --> 1:10:57.880
 But there's an aspect to it, maybe you can correct me,

1:10:57.880 --> 1:10:59.740
 because I'm projecting sort of my idea

1:10:59.740 --> 1:11:04.440
 of what it would take to conquer so much land

1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:08.880
 is the ideology is emergent.

1:11:08.880 --> 1:11:11.960
 So if I were to guess,

1:11:11.960 --> 1:11:16.400
 the Mongols started out as exceptionally,

1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:21.400
 as warriors who valued excellence in skill of killing,

1:11:23.240 --> 1:11:27.280
 not even killing, but like the actual practice of war.

1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:28.640
 And you can start out small,

1:11:28.640 --> 1:11:30.320
 and you can grow and grow and grow.

1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:32.740
 And then in order to maintain the stability

1:11:32.740 --> 1:11:36.720
 of the things over which of the conquered lands,

1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:40.260
 you developed a set of ideas with which you can,

1:11:40.260 --> 1:11:43.900
 like you said, establish control, but it was emergent.

1:11:43.900 --> 1:11:48.740
 And it seems like the core first principle idea

1:11:48.740 --> 1:11:52.780
 of the Mongols is just to be excellent warriors.

1:11:52.780 --> 1:11:55.400
 That felt to me like the starting point.

1:11:55.400 --> 1:11:57.200
 It wasn't some ideology.

1:11:57.200 --> 1:11:59.680
 Like with Hitler and Stalin,

1:11:59.680 --> 1:12:03.120
 with Hitler, there was an ideology

1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:06.960
 that didn't have anything to do with war underneath it.

1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:08.240
 It was more about conquering.

1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:12.920
 It feels like the Mongols started out more organically,

1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:16.240
 I would say, like this phenomenon started emergently,

1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:19.260
 and they were just like similar to the Native Americans

1:12:19.260 --> 1:12:21.960
 with the Comanches, like the different warrior tribes

1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:24.160
 that Joe Rogan's currently obsessed with,

1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:28.120
 that led me to look into it more.

1:12:28.120 --> 1:12:32.200
 They seem to just start out just valuing the skill

1:12:32.200 --> 1:12:35.280
 of fighting whatever the tools of war they had,

1:12:35.280 --> 1:12:36.460
 which were pretty primitive,

1:12:36.460 --> 1:12:38.280
 but just to be the best warriors

1:12:38.280 --> 1:12:40.540
 they could possibly be, make a science out of it.

1:12:40.540 --> 1:12:44.560
 Is that crazy to think that there was no ideology behind it

1:12:44.560 --> 1:12:45.400
 in the beginning?

1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:47.280
 I'm gonna back up a second.

1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:49.680
 I'm reminded of the line said about the Romans,

1:12:49.680 --> 1:12:52.880
 that they create a wasteland and call it peace.

1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:57.000
 That is, but there's a lot of conquerors like that, right?

1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.560
 Where you will sit there, and listen,

1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:03.160
 historians forever have, it's the famous trade offs

1:13:03.160 --> 1:13:04.920
 of empire, and they'll say, well,

1:13:04.920 --> 1:13:07.320
 look at the trade that they facilitated,

1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:09.440
 and look at the religion, all those kinds of things,

1:13:09.440 --> 1:13:13.060
 but they come at the cost of all those peoples

1:13:13.060 --> 1:13:16.840
 that they conquered forcibly and by force,

1:13:16.840 --> 1:13:18.560
 integrated into their empire.

1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:20.720
 The one thing we need to remember about the Mongols

1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:22.800
 that makes them different than, say, the Romans,

1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:26.000
 and this is complex stuff and way above my pay grade,

1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:27.320
 but I'm fascinated with it,

1:13:27.320 --> 1:13:30.260
 and it's more like the Comanches that you just brought up,

1:13:30.260 --> 1:13:33.800
 is that the Mongols are not a settled society, okay?

1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:36.860
 They come from a nomadic tradition.

1:13:36.860 --> 1:13:39.380
 Now, several generations later,

1:13:39.380 --> 1:13:44.240
 when you have Kublai Khan as the emperor of China,

1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:46.600
 it's beginning to be a different thing, right?

1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:48.840
 And the Mongols, when their empire broke up,

1:13:48.840 --> 1:13:50.880
 the ones that were in settled,

1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:53.240
 the so called settled societies, right, Iran,

1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:56.040
 places like that, they will become more like,

1:13:56.040 --> 1:13:59.320
 over time, the rulers of those places were traditionally,

1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:03.680
 and the Mongols in, say, the Khaganate of the Golden Horde,

1:14:03.680 --> 1:14:06.760
 which is still in their traditional nomadic territories,

1:14:06.760 --> 1:14:09.600
 will remain traditionally more Mongol,

1:14:09.600 --> 1:14:12.560
 but when you start talking about who the Mongols were,

1:14:13.440 --> 1:14:15.400
 I try to make a distinction.

1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:19.520
 They're not some really super special people.

1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:23.780
 They're just the latest confederacy in an area

1:14:23.780 --> 1:14:27.680
 that saw nomadic confederacies going back

1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:30.120
 to the beginning of recorded history.

1:14:30.120 --> 1:14:33.640
 The Scythians, the Sarmatians, the Avars,

1:14:33.640 --> 1:14:37.120
 the Huns, the Magyars, I mean, these are all the nomadic,

1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:39.640
 you know, the nomads of the Eurasian steppe

1:14:39.640 --> 1:14:42.880
 were huge, huge players in the history of the world

1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:47.880
 until gunpowder nullified their traditional weapons system,

1:14:49.160 --> 1:14:50.460
 which I've been fascinated with

1:14:50.460 --> 1:14:52.580
 because their traditional weapons system

1:14:52.580 --> 1:14:54.280
 is not one you could copy,

1:14:54.280 --> 1:14:56.400
 because you were talking about being the greatest warriors

1:14:56.400 --> 1:14:57.840
 you could be.

1:14:57.840 --> 1:15:02.080
 Every warrior society I've ever seen values that.

1:15:02.080 --> 1:15:05.200
 What the nomads had of the Eurasian steppe

1:15:05.200 --> 1:15:10.200
 was this relationship between human beings and animals

1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:12.760
 that changed the equation.

1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:15.680
 It was how they rode horses.

1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:18.080
 And societies like the Byzantines,

1:15:18.080 --> 1:15:20.340
 which would form one flank of the steppe

1:15:20.340 --> 1:15:22.580
 and then all the way on the other side you had China,

1:15:22.580 --> 1:15:24.940
 and below that you had Persia,

1:15:24.940 --> 1:15:27.360
 these societies would all attempt

1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:30.640
 to create mounted horsemen who used archery.

1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:32.160
 And they did a good job,

1:15:32.160 --> 1:15:35.000
 but they were never the equals of the nomads

1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.760
 because those people were literally raised in the saddle.

1:15:38.760 --> 1:15:41.520
 They compared them to centaurs.

1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:42.920
 The Comanches, great example,

1:15:42.920 --> 1:15:47.120
 considered to be the best horse riding warriors

1:15:47.120 --> 1:15:48.620
 in North America.

1:15:48.620 --> 1:15:51.720
 The Comanches, I always love watching, there's paintings.

1:15:51.720 --> 1:15:54.960
 George Catlin, the famous painter

1:15:54.960 --> 1:15:57.840
 who painted the Comanches, illustrated it.

1:15:57.840 --> 1:16:01.200
 But the Mongols and the Scythians and the Avars

1:16:01.200 --> 1:16:02.840
 and all these people did it too,

1:16:02.840 --> 1:16:06.680
 where they would shoot from underneath the horse's neck,

1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:09.640
 hiding behind the horse the whole way.

1:16:09.640 --> 1:16:12.120
 You look at a picture of somebody doing that,

1:16:12.120 --> 1:16:13.440
 and it's insane.

1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:15.840
 This is what the Byzantines couldn't do

1:16:15.840 --> 1:16:17.460
 and the Chinese couldn't do.

1:16:17.460 --> 1:16:21.680
 It was a different level of harnessing

1:16:21.680 --> 1:16:23.720
 a human animal relationship

1:16:23.720 --> 1:16:26.260
 that gave them a military advantage

1:16:26.260 --> 1:16:28.600
 that could not be copied, right?

1:16:28.600 --> 1:16:31.560
 It could be emulated, but they were never as good, right?

1:16:31.560 --> 1:16:33.480
 That's why they always hired these people.

1:16:33.480 --> 1:16:35.460
 They hired mercenaries from these areas

1:16:35.460 --> 1:16:38.320
 because they were incomparable, right?

1:16:38.320 --> 1:16:40.680
 It's the combination of people who were shooting bows

1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:43.240
 and arrows from the time they were toddlers,

1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:45.000
 who were riding from the time they were,

1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:46.600
 who rode all the time.

1:16:46.600 --> 1:16:49.560
 I mean, the Huns were bow legged, the Romans said,

1:16:49.560 --> 1:16:50.880
 because they were never,

1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:54.360
 they ate, slept, everything in the saddle.

1:16:54.360 --> 1:16:57.560
 That creates something that is difficult to copy.

1:16:57.560 --> 1:17:00.480
 And it gave them a military advantage.

1:17:00.480 --> 1:17:02.640
 I enjoy reading actually about

1:17:02.640 --> 1:17:04.880
 when that military advantage ended.

1:17:04.880 --> 1:17:07.300
 So 17th and 18th century,

1:17:07.300 --> 1:17:10.260
 when the Chinese on one flank and the Russians on the other

1:17:10.260 --> 1:17:12.540
 are beginning to use firearms and stuff

1:17:12.540 --> 1:17:17.540
 to break this military power of these various Khans.

1:17:18.100 --> 1:17:20.520
 The Mongols were simply the most dominating

1:17:20.520 --> 1:17:23.100
 and most successful of the Confederacies.

1:17:23.100 --> 1:17:24.560
 But if you break it down,

1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:28.680
 they really formed the nucleus at the top of the pyramid,

1:17:28.680 --> 1:17:30.640
 of the apex of the food chain.

1:17:30.640 --> 1:17:33.320
 And a lot of the people that were known as Mongols

1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:37.200
 were really lots of other tribes, non Mongolian tribes,

1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:38.760
 that when the Mongols conquer you,

1:17:38.760 --> 1:17:40.360
 after they killed a lot of you,

1:17:40.360 --> 1:17:43.400
 they incorporated you into their Confederacy

1:17:43.400 --> 1:17:45.440
 and often made you go first.

1:17:45.440 --> 1:17:46.280
 You're gonna fight somebody,

1:17:46.280 --> 1:17:48.080
 we're gonna make these people go out in front

1:17:48.080 --> 1:17:49.580
 and suck up all the arrows

1:17:49.580 --> 1:17:51.540
 before we go in and finish the job.

1:17:51.540 --> 1:17:56.040
 So to me, and I guess a fan of the Mongols would say

1:17:56.040 --> 1:17:59.080
 that the difference and what made the Mongols different

1:17:59.080 --> 1:18:01.240
 wasn't the weapon system or the fighting

1:18:01.240 --> 1:18:03.360
 or the warriors or the armor or anything,

1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:05.000
 it was Genghis Khan.

1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:07.520
 And if you go look at the other really dangerous,

1:18:07.520 --> 1:18:09.000
 from the outside world's perspective,

1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:12.640
 dangerous step, nomadic Confederacies from past history

1:18:12.640 --> 1:18:16.180
 was always when some great leader emerged

1:18:16.180 --> 1:18:17.400
 that could unite the tribes.

1:18:17.400 --> 1:18:19.320
 And you see the same thing in Native American history

1:18:19.320 --> 1:18:21.140
 to a degree too.

1:18:21.140 --> 1:18:24.280
 You had people like Attila, right?

1:18:24.280 --> 1:18:26.280
 Or there's one called Tumen.

1:18:26.280 --> 1:18:28.160
 You go back in history and these people

1:18:28.160 --> 1:18:30.600
 make the history books because they caused

1:18:30.600 --> 1:18:33.480
 an enormous amount of trouble for their settled neighbors

1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:36.840
 that normally, I mean, Chinese Byzantine and Persian

1:18:36.840 --> 1:18:39.660
 approaches to the steppe people were always the same.

1:18:39.660 --> 1:18:42.000
 They would pick out tribes to be friendly with,

1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:43.960
 they would give them money, gifts, hire them,

1:18:43.960 --> 1:18:46.440
 and they would use them against the other tribes.

1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:48.040
 And generally Byzantine,

1:18:48.040 --> 1:18:50.880
 especially in Chinese diplomatic history

1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:54.040
 was all about keeping these tribes separated.

1:18:54.040 --> 1:18:57.480
 Don't let them form confederations of large numbers of them

1:18:57.480 --> 1:18:59.280
 because then they're unstoppable.

1:18:59.280 --> 1:19:01.080
 Attila was a perfect example.

1:19:01.080 --> 1:19:02.840
 The Huns were another large,

1:19:02.840 --> 1:19:05.520
 the Turks, another large confederacy of these people.

1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:08.240
 And they were devastating when they could unite.

1:19:08.240 --> 1:19:10.600
 So the diplomatic policy was don't let them.

1:19:10.600 --> 1:19:12.000
 That's what made the Mongols different

1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:14.000
 is Genghis Khan united them.

1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:16.640
 And then unlike most of the tribal confederacies,

1:19:16.640 --> 1:19:19.880
 they were able to hold it together for a few generations.

1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:24.880
 To linger on the little thread that you started pulling

1:19:24.880 --> 1:19:28.280
 on this man, Genghis Khan, that was a leader.

1:19:28.280 --> 1:19:29.960
 Temujin, yeah.

1:19:29.960 --> 1:19:32.280
 What do you think makes a great leader?

1:19:32.280 --> 1:19:35.000
 Maybe if you have other examples throughout history

1:19:35.920 --> 1:19:40.920
 and great, again, let's use that term loosely.

1:19:41.200 --> 1:19:42.040
 Meaning.

1:19:42.040 --> 1:19:42.880
 Now I was gonna ask for a definition.

1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:46.920
 Great uniter of whether it's evil or good,

1:19:46.920 --> 1:19:48.000
 it doesn't matter.

1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:51.960
 Is there somebody who stands out to you,

1:19:51.960 --> 1:19:56.960
 Alexander the Great talking about military or ideologies,

1:19:57.040 --> 1:20:00.520
 some people bring up FDR or, I mean,

1:20:00.520 --> 1:20:03.720
 you could be the founding fathers of this country,

1:20:03.720 --> 1:20:08.720
 or we can go to, was he man of the century up there?

1:20:09.640 --> 1:20:14.640
 Hitler of the 20th century and Stalin

1:20:14.800 --> 1:20:19.320
 and these people had really amassed the amount of power

1:20:19.320 --> 1:20:20.920
 that probably has never been seen

1:20:20.920 --> 1:20:22.440
 in the history of the world.

1:20:22.440 --> 1:20:24.720
 Is there somebody who stands out to you

1:20:24.720 --> 1:20:28.720
 by way of trying to define what makes a great uniter,

1:20:28.720 --> 1:20:33.080
 great leader in one man or woman, maybe in the future?

1:20:34.120 --> 1:20:35.280
 It's an interesting question.

1:20:35.280 --> 1:20:36.680
 And one I've thought a lot about,

1:20:36.680 --> 1:20:39.080
 because let's take Alexander the Great as an example,

1:20:39.080 --> 1:20:41.720
 because Alexander fascinated the world of his time,

1:20:41.720 --> 1:20:44.120
 fascinated, ever since people have been fascinated

1:20:44.120 --> 1:20:45.200
 with the guy.

1:20:45.200 --> 1:20:49.400
 But Alexander was a hereditary monarch, right?

1:20:49.400 --> 1:20:50.240
 Yeah.

1:20:50.240 --> 1:20:52.200
 He was handed the kingdom.

1:20:52.200 --> 1:20:53.040
 Which is fascinating.

1:20:53.040 --> 1:20:56.780
 Right, but he did not need to rise from nothing

1:20:56.780 --> 1:20:57.760
 to get that job.

1:20:57.760 --> 1:21:00.160
 In fact, he reminds me of a lot of other leaders

1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:03.440
 of Frederick the Great, for example, in Prussia.

1:21:03.440 --> 1:21:06.080
 These are people who inherited

1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:08.620
 the greatest army of their day.

1:21:09.880 --> 1:21:11.960
 Alexander, unless he was an imbecile,

1:21:11.960 --> 1:21:14.760
 was going to be great no matter what,

1:21:14.760 --> 1:21:17.280
 because I mean, if you inherit the Wehrmacht,

1:21:17.280 --> 1:21:19.920
 you're gonna be able to do something with it, right?

1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:23.720
 Alexander's father may have been greater, Philip.

1:21:23.720 --> 1:21:27.640
 Philip II was the guy who literally did create

1:21:27.640 --> 1:21:32.640
 a strong kingdom from a disjointed group of people

1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:34.960
 that were continually beset by their neighbors.

1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:37.680
 He's the one that reformed that army,

1:21:37.680 --> 1:21:41.000
 took things that he had learned from other Greek leaders

1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:42.960
 like the Theban leader at Paminondas,

1:21:44.160 --> 1:21:48.400
 and then laboriously over his lifetime

1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:51.000
 stabilized the frontiers, built this system.

1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:52.640
 He lost an eye doing it.

1:21:53.600 --> 1:21:55.200
 His leg was made lame.

1:21:55.200 --> 1:21:58.420
 I mean, this was a man who looked like he built the empire

1:21:58.420 --> 1:22:00.480
 and led from the front ranks.

1:22:00.480 --> 1:22:04.680
 I mean, and then who may have been killed by his son,

1:22:04.680 --> 1:22:06.800
 we don't know who assassinated Philip,

1:22:06.800 --> 1:22:08.480
 but then handed the greatest army

1:22:08.480 --> 1:22:10.420
 the world had ever seen to his son,

1:22:10.420 --> 1:22:12.000
 who then did great things with it.

1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:13.880
 You see this pattern many times.

1:22:13.880 --> 1:22:17.640
 So in my mind, I'm not sure Alexander

1:22:17.640 --> 1:22:20.320
 really can be that great when you compare him

1:22:20.320 --> 1:22:22.320
 to people who arose from nothing.

1:22:22.320 --> 1:22:24.220
 So the difference between what we would call

1:22:24.220 --> 1:22:27.040
 in the United States the self made man

1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:29.360
 or the one who inherits a fortune.

1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:31.840
 There's an old line that, it's a slur,

1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:33.480
 but it's about rich people.

1:22:33.480 --> 1:22:37.080
 And it's like he was born on third base

1:22:37.080 --> 1:22:39.480
 and thought he hit a triple, right?

1:22:39.480 --> 1:22:42.880
 Philip was born at home plate and he had to hit.

1:22:42.880 --> 1:22:45.200
 Alexander started on third base.

1:22:45.200 --> 1:22:48.100
 And so I try to draw a distinction between them.

1:22:48.100 --> 1:22:51.700
 Genghis Khan is tough because there's two traditions.

1:22:51.700 --> 1:22:53.560
 The tradition that we grew up with here

1:22:53.560 --> 1:22:55.340
 in the United States and that I grew up learning

1:22:55.340 --> 1:22:57.800
 was that he was a self made man.

1:22:57.800 --> 1:22:59.240
 But there is a tradition,

1:22:59.240 --> 1:23:01.920
 and it may be one of those things that's put after the fact

1:23:01.920 --> 1:23:05.720
 because a long time ago, whether or not you had blue blood

1:23:05.720 --> 1:23:08.840
 in your veins was an important distinction.

1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:10.620
 And so the distinction that you'll often hear

1:23:10.620 --> 1:23:14.580
 from Mongolian history is that this was a nobleman

1:23:14.580 --> 1:23:16.640
 who had been deprived of his inheritance.

1:23:16.640 --> 1:23:18.720
 So he was a blue blood anyway.

1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:20.660
 I don't know which is true.

1:23:20.660 --> 1:23:22.960
 There's certainly, I mean, when you look at a Genghis Khan,

1:23:22.960 --> 1:23:26.720
 you have to go, that is a wicked amount of things

1:23:26.720 --> 1:23:28.320
 to have achieved.

1:23:28.320 --> 1:23:30.200
 He's very impressive as a figure.

1:23:30.200 --> 1:23:32.200
 Attila is very impressive as a figure.

1:23:33.600 --> 1:23:35.120
 Hitler's an interesting figure.

1:23:35.120 --> 1:23:36.800
 He's one of those people,

1:23:36.800 --> 1:23:38.600
 you know, the more you study about Hitler,

1:23:38.600 --> 1:23:43.200
 the more you wonder where the defining moment was.

1:23:43.200 --> 1:23:46.040
 Because if you look at his life,

1:23:46.040 --> 1:23:50.240
 I mean, Hitler was a relatively common soldier

1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:51.200
 in the First World War.

1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:52.240
 I mean, he was brave.

1:23:52.240 --> 1:23:54.280
 He got some decorations.

1:23:54.280 --> 1:23:56.040
 In fact, the highest decoration he got

1:23:56.040 --> 1:23:59.660
 in the First World War was given to him by a Jewish officer.

1:23:59.660 --> 1:24:03.080
 And he often didn't talk about that decoration,

1:24:03.080 --> 1:24:04.760
 even though it was the more prestigious one

1:24:04.760 --> 1:24:06.320
 because it would open up a whole can of worms

1:24:06.320 --> 1:24:07.720
 you didn't wanna get into.

1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:11.240
 But Hitler's, I mean, if you said who was Hitler today,

1:24:11.240 --> 1:24:12.660
 one of the top things you're gonna say

1:24:12.660 --> 1:24:14.720
 is he was an anti Semite.

1:24:14.720 --> 1:24:16.040
 Well, then you have to draw a distinction

1:24:16.040 --> 1:24:19.840
 between general regular anti Semitism

1:24:19.840 --> 1:24:21.640
 that was pretty common in the era

1:24:21.640 --> 1:24:24.440
 and something that was a rabid level of anti Semitism.

1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:27.560
 But Hitler didn't seem to show a rabid level

1:24:27.560 --> 1:24:29.480
 of anti Semitism until after

1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:31.560
 or at the very end of the First World War.

1:24:31.560 --> 1:24:34.880
 So if this is a defining part of this person's character

1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:38.320
 and much of what we consider to be his evil

1:24:38.320 --> 1:24:41.440
 stems from that, what happened to this guy

1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:43.200
 when he's an adult, right?

1:24:43.200 --> 1:24:45.960
 He's already fought in the war to change him so.

1:24:45.960 --> 1:24:47.200
 I mean, it's almost like the old,

1:24:47.200 --> 1:24:48.240
 there was always a movie theme.

1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:50.740
 Somebody gets hit by something on the head

1:24:50.740 --> 1:24:52.840
 and their whole personality changes, right?

1:24:52.840 --> 1:24:55.340
 I mean, it almost seems something like that.

1:24:55.340 --> 1:24:58.840
 So I don't think I call that necessarily a great leader.

1:24:58.840 --> 1:25:00.200
 To me, the interesting thing about Hitler

1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:03.600
 is what the hell happened to a nondescript person

1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:07.160
 who didn't really impress anybody with his skills.

1:25:07.160 --> 1:25:10.440
 And then in the 1920s, it's all of a sudden,

1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:12.800
 as you said, sort of the man of the hour, right?

1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:14.040
 So that to me is kind of,

1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:16.420
 I have this feeling that Genghis Khan,

1:25:16.420 --> 1:25:18.000
 and we don't really know,

1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:20.520
 was an impressive human being from the get go.

1:25:20.520 --> 1:25:22.040
 And then he was raised in this environment

1:25:22.040 --> 1:25:23.440
 with pressure on all sides.

1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:26.000
 So you start with this diamond and then you polish it

1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:27.720
 and you harden it his whole life.

1:25:27.720 --> 1:25:31.240
 Hitler seemed to be a very unimpressive gemstone

1:25:31.240 --> 1:25:33.320
 most of his life, and then all of a sudden.

1:25:33.320 --> 1:25:36.800
 So, I mean, I don't think I can label great leaders.

1:25:36.800 --> 1:25:39.360
 And I'm always fascinated by that idea that,

1:25:39.360 --> 1:25:41.540
 and I'm trying to remember who the quote was by that,

1:25:41.540 --> 1:25:43.440
 that great men, oh, Lord Acton.

1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:46.360
 So great men are often not good men.

1:25:47.240 --> 1:25:49.120
 And that in order to be great,

1:25:49.120 --> 1:25:51.760
 you would have to jettison many of the moral qualities

1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:55.200
 that we normally would consider a Jesus or a Gandhi,

1:25:55.200 --> 1:25:58.640
 or, you know, these qualities that one looks at

1:25:58.640 --> 1:26:01.160
 as the good upstanding moral qualities

1:26:01.160 --> 1:26:03.460
 that we should all aspire to as examples, right?

1:26:03.460 --> 1:26:05.600
 The Buddha, whatever it might be,

1:26:05.600 --> 1:26:07.240
 those people wouldn't make good leaders

1:26:07.240 --> 1:26:08.600
 because what you need to be a good leader

1:26:08.600 --> 1:26:10.480
 often requires the kind of choices

1:26:10.480 --> 1:26:14.840
 that a true philosophical diogenes moral man wouldn't make.

1:26:15.840 --> 1:26:17.360
 So I don't have an answer to your question.

1:26:17.360 --> 1:26:18.200
 How about that?

1:26:18.200 --> 1:26:20.120
 That's a long way of saying, I don't know.

1:26:20.120 --> 1:26:22.240
 Just linger a little bit.

1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:24.960
 It does feel like from my study of Hitler

1:26:24.960 --> 1:26:28.840
 that the time molded the man versus Genghis Khan,

1:26:28.840 --> 1:26:33.600
 where it feels like he, the man molded his time.

1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:34.520
 Yes, and I feel that way

1:26:34.520 --> 1:26:37.840
 about a lot of those nomadic Confederacy builders,

1:26:37.840 --> 1:26:41.120
 that they really seem to be these figures

1:26:41.120 --> 1:26:45.760
 that stand out as extraordinary in one way or another.

1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:46.600
 Remembering, by the way,

1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:48.600
 that almost all the history of them were written

1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:50.560
 by the enemies that they so mistreated

1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:52.720
 that they were probably never gonna get any good press.

1:26:52.720 --> 1:26:53.960
 They didn't write themselves.

1:26:53.960 --> 1:26:54.800
 That's a caveat.

1:26:54.800 --> 1:26:56.080
 We should always add to basically all of human history.

1:26:56.080 --> 1:26:58.040
 Nomadic or Native American peoples

1:26:58.040 --> 1:26:59.760
 or tribal peoples anywhere

1:26:59.760 --> 1:27:01.440
 generally do not get the advantage

1:27:01.440 --> 1:27:04.720
 of being able to write the history of their heroes.

1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:08.360
 Okay, I've recently almost done

1:27:08.360 --> 1:27:11.360
 with the rise and the fall of the Third Reich.

1:27:11.360 --> 1:27:16.360
 It's one of the historical descriptions

1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:20.600
 of Hitler's rise to power, Nazi's rise to power.

1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:23.440
 There's a few philosophical things

1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:27.840
 I'd like to ask you to see if you can help.

1:27:27.840 --> 1:27:32.120
 Like one of the things I think about

1:27:32.120 --> 1:27:37.120
 is how does one be a hero in 1930s Nazi Germany?

1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:41.360
 What does it mean to be a hero?

1:27:41.360 --> 1:27:44.920
 What do heroic actions look like?

1:27:44.920 --> 1:27:49.920
 I think about that because I think about

1:27:50.280 --> 1:27:52.760
 how I move about in this world today.

1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:00.480
 That we live in really chaotic, intense times

1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:04.320
 where I don't think you wanna draw any parallels

1:28:04.320 --> 1:28:06.440
 between Nazi Germany and modern day

1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:09.600
 in any of the nations we can think about.

1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:12.080
 But it's not out of the realm of possibility

1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:17.080
 that authoritarian governments take hold,

1:28:18.160 --> 1:28:21.000
 authoritarian companies take hold.

1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:24.960
 And I'd like to think that I could be

1:28:24.960 --> 1:28:27.640
 in my little small way and inspire others

1:28:27.640 --> 1:28:32.480
 to take the heroic action before things get bad.

1:28:33.560 --> 1:28:36.640
 And I kind of try to place myself

1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:40.000
 in what would 1930s Germany look like?

1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:43.560
 Is it possible to stop a Hitler?

1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:47.800
 Is it even the right way to think about it?

1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:51.480
 And how does one be a hero in it?

1:28:51.480 --> 1:28:53.920
 I mean, you often talk about that living through

1:28:53.920 --> 1:28:55.640
 a moment in history is very different

1:28:55.640 --> 1:28:57.520
 than looking at that history,

1:28:57.520 --> 1:29:00.040
 looking when you look back.

1:29:00.040 --> 1:29:03.920
 I also think about it, would it be possible

1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:06.960
 to understand what's happening

1:29:06.960 --> 1:29:11.520
 that the bells of war are ringing?

1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:16.240
 It seems that most people didn't seem to understand,

1:29:16.240 --> 1:29:19.800
 you know, late into the 30s that war is coming.

1:29:21.040 --> 1:29:22.320
 That's fascinating.

1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:25.760
 On the United States side, inside Germany,

1:29:25.760 --> 1:29:27.880
 like the opposing figures,

1:29:27.880 --> 1:29:30.920
 the German military didn't seem to understand this.

1:29:30.920 --> 1:29:34.680
 Maybe the other countries, certainly France

1:29:34.680 --> 1:29:37.560
 and England didn't seem to understand this.

1:29:37.560 --> 1:29:41.360
 That kind of tried to put myself into 90s, 30s Germany

1:29:41.360 --> 1:29:45.360
 as I'm Jewish, which is another little twist on the whole.

1:29:46.800 --> 1:29:48.120
 Like what would I do?

1:29:48.120 --> 1:29:49.400
 What should one do?

1:29:51.440 --> 1:29:54.400
 Do you have interesting answers?

1:29:54.400 --> 1:29:56.120
 So earlier we had talked about Putin

1:29:56.120 --> 1:29:57.920
 and we had talked about patriotism

1:29:57.920 --> 1:30:00.680
 and love of country and those sorts of things.

1:30:00.680 --> 1:30:05.680
 In order to be a hero in Nazi Germany

1:30:05.800 --> 1:30:10.720
 by our views here, you would have had to have been

1:30:11.720 --> 1:30:15.720
 anti patriotic to the average German's viewpoint

1:30:15.720 --> 1:30:16.960
 in the 1930s, right?

1:30:16.960 --> 1:30:20.000
 You would have to have opposed your own government

1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:21.280
 and your own country.

1:30:21.280 --> 1:30:24.160
 And that's a very, it would be a very weird thing

1:30:24.160 --> 1:30:26.080
 to go to people in Germany and say,

1:30:26.080 --> 1:30:28.040
 listen, the only way you're gonna be seen

1:30:28.040 --> 1:30:32.080
 as a good German and a hero to the country

1:30:32.080 --> 1:30:35.080
 that will be your enemies is we think

1:30:35.080 --> 1:30:36.680
 you should oppose your own government.

1:30:36.680 --> 1:30:40.520
 It's a strange position to put the people

1:30:40.520 --> 1:30:43.240
 in a government saying you need to be against your leader,

1:30:43.240 --> 1:30:45.520
 you need to oppose your government's policies,

1:30:45.520 --> 1:30:47.080
 you need to oppose your government,

1:30:47.080 --> 1:30:49.600
 you need to hope and work for its downfall.

1:30:49.600 --> 1:30:51.160
 That doesn't sound patriotic.

1:30:51.160 --> 1:30:53.360
 It wouldn't sound patriotic here in this country

1:30:53.360 --> 1:30:55.080
 if you made a similar argument.

1:30:55.080 --> 1:31:00.080
 I will go away from the 1930s and go to the 1940s

1:31:00.480 --> 1:31:01.520
 to answer your question.

1:31:01.520 --> 1:31:05.320
 So there is movements like the White Rose Movement

1:31:05.320 --> 1:31:09.000
 in Germany, which involved young people really,

1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:13.240
 and from various backgrounds, religious backgrounds often,

1:31:13.240 --> 1:31:17.320
 who worked openly against the Nazi government

1:31:17.320 --> 1:31:19.880
 at a time when power was already consolidated,

1:31:19.880 --> 1:31:23.320
 the Gestapo was in full force and they execute people

1:31:23.320 --> 1:31:24.680
 who are against the government.

1:31:24.680 --> 1:31:26.400
 And these young people would go out

1:31:26.400 --> 1:31:29.900
 and distribute pamphlets and many of them got their heads

1:31:29.900 --> 1:31:32.700
 cut off with guillotines for their trouble.

1:31:32.700 --> 1:31:35.960
 And they knew that that was gonna be the penalty.

1:31:35.960 --> 1:31:40.960
 That is a remarkable amount of bravery and sacrifice

1:31:41.560 --> 1:31:44.700
 and willingness to die, and almost not even willingness

1:31:44.700 --> 1:31:46.020
 because they were so open about it,

1:31:46.020 --> 1:31:48.120
 it's almost a certainty, right?

1:31:49.620 --> 1:31:51.620
 That's incredibly moving to me.

1:31:51.620 --> 1:31:53.160
 So when we talk, and we had talked earlier

1:31:53.160 --> 1:31:56.000
 about sort of the human spirit and all that kind of thing,

1:31:57.040 --> 1:32:01.920
 there are people in the German military who opposed

1:32:01.920 --> 1:32:04.480
 and worked against Hitler, for example.

1:32:04.480 --> 1:32:08.120
 But to me, that's almost cowardly compared

1:32:08.120 --> 1:32:10.600
 to what these young people did in the White Rose Movement

1:32:10.600 --> 1:32:13.960
 because those people in the Wehrmacht, for example,

1:32:13.960 --> 1:32:16.320
 who were secretly trying to undermine Hitler,

1:32:16.320 --> 1:32:18.920
 they're not really putting their lives on the line

1:32:18.920 --> 1:32:20.240
 to the same degree.

1:32:20.240 --> 1:32:23.760
 And so I think when I look at heroes,

1:32:23.760 --> 1:32:25.360
 and listen, I remember once saying

1:32:25.360 --> 1:32:28.720
 there were no conscientious objectors in Germany

1:32:28.720 --> 1:32:30.680
 as a way to point out to people

1:32:30.680 --> 1:32:31.600
 that you didn't have a choice,

1:32:31.600 --> 1:32:32.680
 you know, you were gonna serve in there.

1:32:32.680 --> 1:32:35.500
 And I got letters from Jehovah's Witnesses who said,

1:32:35.500 --> 1:32:36.920
 yes, there were.

1:32:36.920 --> 1:32:39.400
 And we got sent to the concentration camps.

1:32:39.400 --> 1:32:42.080
 Those are remarkably brave things.

1:32:42.080 --> 1:32:47.080
 It's one thing to have your own set of standards and values.

1:32:47.080 --> 1:32:50.460
 It's another thing to say, oh no,

1:32:50.460 --> 1:32:52.580
 I'm going to display them in a way

1:32:52.580 --> 1:32:54.580
 that with this regime, that's a death sentence.

1:32:54.580 --> 1:32:57.580
 And not just for me, for my family, right?

1:32:57.580 --> 1:33:00.460
 In these regimes, there was not a lot of distinction made

1:33:00.460 --> 1:33:02.500
 between father and son and wives.

1:33:03.380 --> 1:33:05.540
 That's a remarkable sacrifice to make.

1:33:05.540 --> 1:33:08.640
 And far beyond what I think I would even be capable of.

1:33:08.640 --> 1:33:12.740
 And so the admiration comes from seeing people

1:33:12.740 --> 1:33:16.020
 who appear to be more morally profound

1:33:16.020 --> 1:33:18.040
 than you are yourself.

1:33:18.040 --> 1:33:20.460
 So when I look at this, I look at that kind of thing

1:33:20.460 --> 1:33:22.600
 and I just say, wow.

1:33:22.600 --> 1:33:24.360
 And the funny thing is if you'd have gone

1:33:24.360 --> 1:33:29.360
 to most average Germans on the street in 1942

1:33:29.580 --> 1:33:31.660
 and said, what do you think of these people?

1:33:31.660 --> 1:33:33.340
 They're gonna think of them as traitors

1:33:33.340 --> 1:33:35.820
 who probably got what they deserved.

1:33:35.820 --> 1:33:37.660
 So that's the eye of the beholder thing.

1:33:37.660 --> 1:33:42.660
 It's the power of the state to sow propagandize values

1:33:42.660 --> 1:33:45.960
 and morality in a way that favors the state

1:33:45.960 --> 1:33:49.200
 that you can turn people who today we look at

1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:51.840
 as unbelievably brave and moral

1:33:51.840 --> 1:33:54.280
 and crusading for righteousness

1:33:54.280 --> 1:33:56.760
 and turn them into enemies of the people.

1:33:58.160 --> 1:34:00.860
 So, I mean, in my mind, it would be people like that.

1:34:00.860 --> 1:34:05.520
 See, I think, so hero is a funny word

1:34:05.520 --> 1:34:07.760
 and we romanticize the notion,

1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:11.720
 but if I could drag you back to 1930s Germany from 1940s.

1:34:11.720 --> 1:34:12.560
 Sure.

1:34:13.600 --> 1:34:18.480
 I feel like the heroic actions that doesn't accomplish much

1:34:19.320 --> 1:34:21.760
 is not what I'm referring to.

1:34:21.760 --> 1:34:26.760
 So there's many heroes I look up to that,

1:34:27.200 --> 1:34:29.200
 like David Goggins, for example,

1:34:29.200 --> 1:34:31.360
 the guy who runs crazy distances.

1:34:31.360 --> 1:34:35.280
 He runs for no purpose except for the suffering in itself.

1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:38.880
 And I think his willingness to challenge the limits

1:34:38.880 --> 1:34:42.120
 of his mind is heroic.

1:34:42.120 --> 1:34:44.520
 I guess I'm looking for a different term,

1:34:44.520 --> 1:34:47.880
 which is how could Hitler have been stopped?

1:34:49.080 --> 1:34:52.120
 My sense is that he could have been stopped

1:34:52.120 --> 1:34:56.160
 in the battle of ideas where people,

1:34:56.160 --> 1:34:59.680
 millions of people were suffering economically

1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:02.900
 or suffering because of the betrayal of World War I

1:35:02.900 --> 1:35:04.720
 in terms of the love of country

1:35:04.720 --> 1:35:07.440
 and how they felt they were being treated.

1:35:07.440 --> 1:35:11.920
 And a charismatic leader that inspired love

1:35:11.920 --> 1:35:15.540
 and unity that's not destructive could have emerged.

1:35:15.540 --> 1:35:18.320
 And that's where the battle should have been fought.

1:35:18.320 --> 1:35:22.740
 I would suggest that we need to take into account

1:35:22.740 --> 1:35:26.620
 the context of the times that led to Hitler's rise of power

1:35:26.620 --> 1:35:31.240
 and created the conditions where his message resonated.

1:35:31.240 --> 1:35:34.760
 That is not a message that resonates at all times, right?

1:35:34.760 --> 1:35:39.760
 It is impossible to understand the rise of Hitler

1:35:40.160 --> 1:35:42.040
 without dealing with the First World War

1:35:42.040 --> 1:35:44.020
 and the aftermath of the First World War

1:35:44.020 --> 1:35:46.560
 and the inflationary terrible depression in Germany

1:35:46.560 --> 1:35:50.320
 and all these things and the dissatisfaction

1:35:50.320 --> 1:35:52.100
 with the Weimar Republic's government,

1:35:52.100 --> 1:35:55.440
 which was often seen as something put into,

1:35:55.440 --> 1:35:59.240
 which it was put into place by the victorious powers.

1:35:59.240 --> 1:36:02.340
 Hitler referred to the people that signed those agreements

1:36:02.340 --> 1:36:06.280
 that signed the armistice as the November criminals.

1:36:06.280 --> 1:36:08.240
 And he used that as a phrase

1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:10.080
 which resonated with the population.

1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:12.800
 This was a population that was embittered.

1:36:12.800 --> 1:36:14.280
 And even if they weren't embittered,

1:36:14.280 --> 1:36:15.920
 the times were so terrible.

1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:19.600
 And the options for operating within the system

1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:24.460
 in a non radical way seemed totally discredited, right?

1:36:24.460 --> 1:36:25.880
 You could work through the Weimar Republic,

1:36:25.880 --> 1:36:27.640
 but they tried and it wasn't working anyway.

1:36:27.640 --> 1:36:29.880
 And then the alternative to the Nazis

1:36:29.880 --> 1:36:31.800
 who were bully boys in the street

1:36:31.800 --> 1:36:33.480
 were communist agitators

1:36:33.480 --> 1:36:36.800
 that to the average conservative Germans seem no better.

1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:38.020
 So you have three options

1:36:38.020 --> 1:36:39.760
 if you're an average German person.

1:36:39.760 --> 1:36:42.360
 You can go with the discredited government

1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:46.760
 put in power by your enemies that wasn't working anyway.

1:36:46.760 --> 1:36:48.120
 You could go with the Nazis

1:36:48.120 --> 1:36:49.960
 who seemed like a bunch of super patriots

1:36:49.960 --> 1:36:54.120
 calling for the restoration of German authority,

1:36:54.120 --> 1:36:55.720
 or you could go with the communists.

1:36:55.720 --> 1:37:00.000
 And the entire thing seemed like a litany of poor options.

1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:03.680
 And in this realm, Hitler was able to triangulate,

1:37:03.680 --> 1:37:04.700
 if you will.

1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:08.840
 He came off as a person

1:37:08.840 --> 1:37:11.100
 who was going to restore German greatness

1:37:11.100 --> 1:37:13.640
 at a time when this was a powerful message.

1:37:13.640 --> 1:37:16.580
 But if you don't need German greatness restored,

1:37:16.580 --> 1:37:18.840
 it doesn't resonate, right?

1:37:18.840 --> 1:37:23.560
 So the reason that your love idea and all this stuff,

1:37:23.560 --> 1:37:25.600
 I don't think would have worked in the time period

1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:27.700
 is because that was not a commodity

1:37:27.700 --> 1:37:30.960
 that the average German was in search of then.

1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:33.760
 Well, it's interesting to think about

1:37:33.760 --> 1:37:38.200
 whether greatness can be restored through mechanisms,

1:37:38.200 --> 1:37:40.620
 through ideas that are not so,

1:37:41.920 --> 1:37:46.740
 from our perspective today, so evil.

1:37:46.740 --> 1:37:48.700
 I don't know what the right term is.

1:37:48.700 --> 1:37:50.500
 But the war continued in a way.

1:37:50.500 --> 1:37:52.460
 So remember that when Germany,

1:37:52.460 --> 1:37:54.840
 when Hitler is rising to power,

1:37:54.840 --> 1:37:58.440
 the French are in control of parts of Germany, right?

1:37:58.440 --> 1:38:01.680
 The Ruhr, one of the main industrial heartlands of Germany,

1:38:01.680 --> 1:38:02.920
 was occupied by the French.

1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:04.500
 So there's never this point

1:38:04.500 --> 1:38:07.960
 where you're allowed to let the hate dissipate, right?

1:38:07.960 --> 1:38:10.440
 Every time maybe things were calming down,

1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:13.120
 something else would happen to stick the knife in

1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:14.280
 and twist it a little bit more,

1:38:14.280 --> 1:38:16.960
 from the average German's perspective, right?

1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:18.400
 The reparations, right?

1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:20.600
 So if you say, okay, well, we're gonna get back on our feet,

1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:22.560
 the reparations were crushing.

1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:27.200
 These things prevented the idea of love or brotherhood

1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:29.280
 and all these things from taking hold.

1:38:29.280 --> 1:38:31.480
 And even if there were Germans who felt that way,

1:38:31.480 --> 1:38:33.680
 and there most certainly were,

1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:38.680
 it is hard to overcome the power of everyone else.

1:38:38.760 --> 1:38:39.620
 You know, what I always say

1:38:39.620 --> 1:38:41.960
 when people talk to me about humanity

1:38:41.960 --> 1:38:44.520
 is I believe on individual levels,

1:38:44.520 --> 1:38:46.960
 we're capable of everything and anything,

1:38:46.960 --> 1:38:48.580
 good, bad, or indifferent.

1:38:48.580 --> 1:38:51.280
 But collectively, it's different, right?

1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:55.360
 And in the time period that we're talking about here,

1:38:55.360 --> 1:38:58.100
 messages of peace on earth and love your enemies

1:38:58.100 --> 1:39:00.600
 and all these sorts of things

1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:03.400
 were absolutely deluged and overwhelmed

1:39:03.400 --> 1:39:06.400
 and drowned out by the bitterness, the hatred,

1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:07.280
 and let's be honest,

1:39:07.280 --> 1:39:10.200
 the sense that you were continually being abused

1:39:10.200 --> 1:39:11.760
 by your former enemies.

1:39:11.760 --> 1:39:14.200
 There were a lot of people in the Allied side

1:39:14.200 --> 1:39:17.560
 that realized this and said, we're setting up the next war.

1:39:17.560 --> 1:39:18.960
 This is, I mean, they understood

1:39:18.960 --> 1:39:20.840
 that you can only do certain things

1:39:20.840 --> 1:39:23.040
 to collective human populations

1:39:23.040 --> 1:39:24.320
 for a certain period of time

1:39:24.320 --> 1:39:26.680
 before it is natural for them to want to.

1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:29.040
 And there are, you can see German posters from the region,

1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:31.680
 Nazi propaganda posters that show them

1:39:31.680 --> 1:39:33.640
 breaking off the chains of their enemies.

1:39:33.640 --> 1:39:35.160
 And I mean, Germany awake, right?

1:39:35.160 --> 1:39:37.440
 That was the great slogan.

1:39:37.440 --> 1:39:42.440
 So I think love is always a difficult option.

1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:44.960
 And in the context of those times,

1:39:44.960 --> 1:39:48.840
 it was even more disempowered than normal.

1:39:48.840 --> 1:39:51.680
 Well, this goes to the,

1:39:51.680 --> 1:39:54.800
 just to linger on it for a little longer,

1:39:54.800 --> 1:39:58.560
 the question of the inevitability of history.

1:39:59.660 --> 1:40:02.480
 Do you think Hitler could have been stopped?

1:40:02.480 --> 1:40:04.840
 Do you think this kind of force that you're saying

1:40:04.840 --> 1:40:07.800
 that there was a pain and it was building,

1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:10.400
 there was a hatred that was building,

1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:13.100
 do you think there was a way to avert?

1:40:15.700 --> 1:40:17.000
 I mean, there's two questions.

1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:22.000
 Could have been a lot worse and could have been better

1:40:22.240 --> 1:40:25.320
 in the trajectory of history in the 30s and 40s.

1:40:25.320 --> 1:40:28.000
 The most logical, see, we had started this conversation,

1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.320
 it brings a wonderful bow tie into the discussion

1:40:30.320 --> 1:40:32.360
 and buttons it up nicely.

1:40:32.360 --> 1:40:35.640
 We had talked about force and counter force earlier.

1:40:35.640 --> 1:40:38.540
 The most obvious and much discussed way

1:40:38.540 --> 1:40:39.680
 that Hitler could have been stopped

1:40:39.680 --> 1:40:41.320
 has nothing to do with Germans.

1:40:42.160 --> 1:40:45.400
 When he remilitarized the Rhineland,

1:40:45.400 --> 1:40:49.760
 everyone talks about what a couple of French divisions

1:40:49.760 --> 1:40:52.340
 would have done had they simply gone in and contested.

1:40:52.340 --> 1:40:54.280
 And this was something Hitler was extremely,

1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:56.120
 I mean, it might've been the most nervous time

1:40:56.120 --> 1:40:58.720
 in his entire career because he was afraid

1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:01.000
 that they would have responded with force

1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:03.440
 and he was in no position to do anything about it

1:41:03.440 --> 1:41:04.640
 if they did.

1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:07.240
 So this is where you get the people who say,

1:41:08.640 --> 1:41:10.240
 and Churchill's one of these people too,

1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:13.480
 where they talk about that he should have been stopped

1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:16.720
 militarily right at the very beginning when he was weak.

1:41:16.720 --> 1:41:18.120
 I don't think...

1:41:20.120 --> 1:41:23.480
 Listen, there were candidates in the Catholic Center Party

1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:25.520
 and others in the Weimar Republic

1:41:25.520 --> 1:41:26.760
 that maybe could have done things

1:41:26.760 --> 1:41:30.680
 and it's beyond my understanding of specific German history

1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:32.680
 to talk about it intelligently.

1:41:32.680 --> 1:41:35.840
 But I do think that had the French responded militarily

1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:38.760
 to Hitler's initial moves into that area,

1:41:38.760 --> 1:41:40.200
 that he would have been thwarted.

1:41:40.200 --> 1:41:42.160
 And I think he himself believed,

1:41:42.160 --> 1:41:44.560
 if I'm remembering my reading,

1:41:44.560 --> 1:41:46.820
 that this would have led to his downfall.

1:41:46.820 --> 1:41:47.960
 So the potential...

1:41:47.960 --> 1:41:49.720
 See, what I don't like about this

1:41:49.720 --> 1:41:52.760
 is that it almost legitimizes military intervention

1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:54.280
 at a very early stage

1:41:54.280 --> 1:41:56.360
 to prevent worse things from happening,

1:41:56.360 --> 1:41:58.760
 but it might be a pretty clear cut case.

1:41:58.760 --> 1:42:01.960
 But it shows we pointed out that there was a lot of sympathy

1:42:01.960 --> 1:42:04.680
 on the part of the allies for the fact that

1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:06.920
 the Germans probably should have Germany back

1:42:06.920 --> 1:42:08.980
 and this is traditional German land.

1:42:08.980 --> 1:42:11.000
 I mean, they were trying, in a funny way,

1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:14.880
 it's almost like the love and the sense of justice

1:42:14.880 --> 1:42:18.440
 on the allies part may have actually stayed their hand

1:42:18.440 --> 1:42:20.480
 in a way that would have prevented

1:42:20.480 --> 1:42:22.160
 much, much, much worse things later.

1:42:22.160 --> 1:42:26.080
 But if the times were such

1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:28.520
 that the message of a Hitler resonated,

1:42:28.520 --> 1:42:30.900
 then simply removing Hitler from the equation

1:42:30.900 --> 1:42:34.200
 would not have removed the context of the times.

1:42:34.200 --> 1:42:36.680
 And that means one of two things,

1:42:36.680 --> 1:42:39.120
 either you could have had another one

1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:43.240
 or you could have ended up in a situation equally bad

1:42:43.240 --> 1:42:44.840
 in a different direction.

1:42:44.840 --> 1:42:46.260
 I don't know what that means

1:42:46.260 --> 1:42:49.080
 because it's hard to imagine anything could be worse

1:42:49.080 --> 1:42:52.440
 than what actually occurred, but history's funny that way.

1:42:52.440 --> 1:42:55.560
 And Hitler's always everyone's favorite example

1:42:55.560 --> 1:42:58.360
 of the difference between the great man theory of history

1:42:58.360 --> 1:43:01.400
 and the trends and forces theories of history, right?

1:43:01.400 --> 1:43:03.840
 The times made a Hitler possible

1:43:03.840 --> 1:43:06.160
 and maybe even desirable to some.

1:43:06.160 --> 1:43:08.640
 If you took him out of the equation,

1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:12.040
 those trends and forces are still in place, right?

1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:13.840
 So what does that mean?

1:43:13.840 --> 1:43:16.600
 If you take him out and the door is still open,

1:43:16.600 --> 1:43:19.040
 does somebody else walk through it?

1:43:19.040 --> 1:43:21.960
 Yeah, it's mathematically speaking,

1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:26.960
 the probability of charismatic leaders emerge.

1:43:28.120 --> 1:43:32.500
 I'm so torn on that at this point.

1:43:32.500 --> 1:43:33.880
 Here's another way to look at it.

1:43:33.880 --> 1:43:37.840
 The institutional stability of Germany

1:43:37.840 --> 1:43:41.320
 in that time period was not enough to push back.

1:43:41.320 --> 1:43:43.220
 And there are other periods in German history.

1:43:43.220 --> 1:43:47.720
 I mean, that Hitler arose in, arisen in 1913,

1:43:47.720 --> 1:43:49.120
 he doesn't get anywhere

1:43:49.120 --> 1:43:51.520
 because Germany's institutional power

1:43:51.520 --> 1:43:54.400
 is enough to simply quash that.

1:43:54.400 --> 1:43:57.560
 It's the fact that Germany was unstable anyway

1:43:57.560 --> 1:43:59.560
 that prevented a united front

1:43:59.560 --> 1:44:02.440
 that would have kept radicalism from getting out of hand.

1:44:02.440 --> 1:44:03.280
 Does that make sense?

1:44:03.280 --> 1:44:04.280
 Yes, absolutely.

1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:06.080
 A tricky question on this,

1:44:06.080 --> 1:44:09.480
 just to stay on this a little longer

1:44:09.480 --> 1:44:11.400
 because I'm not sure how to think about it,

1:44:11.400 --> 1:44:15.300
 is the World War II versus the Holocaust.

1:44:18.800 --> 1:44:20.640
 We were talking just now

1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:23.640
 about the way that history unrolls itself

1:44:23.640 --> 1:44:26.200
 and could Hitler have been stopped?

1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:30.840
 And I don't quite know what to think about Hitler

1:44:30.840 --> 1:44:33.080
 without the Holocaust.

1:44:33.080 --> 1:44:36.440
 And perhaps in his thinking,

1:44:36.440 --> 1:44:39.680
 how essential the antisemitism

1:44:39.680 --> 1:44:43.180
 and the hatred of Jews was.

1:44:44.400 --> 1:44:47.020
 It feels to me that,

1:44:48.080 --> 1:44:50.280
 I mean, we were just talking about

1:44:50.280 --> 1:44:54.520
 where did he pick up his hatred of the Jewish people?

1:44:54.520 --> 1:44:57.880
 There's stories in Vienna and so on

1:44:57.880 --> 1:45:02.240
 that it almost is picking up the idea

1:45:02.240 --> 1:45:05.700
 of antisemitism as a really useful tool,

1:45:06.900 --> 1:45:10.360
 as opposed to actually believing it in its core.

1:45:10.360 --> 1:45:13.120
 Do you think World War II as it turned out

1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:15.560
 and Hitler as he turned out

1:45:15.560 --> 1:45:18.560
 would be possible without antisemitism?

1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:21.420
 Could we have avoided the Holocaust?

1:45:21.420 --> 1:45:26.200
 Or was it an integral part of the ideology

1:45:26.200 --> 1:45:29.240
 of fascism and the Nazis?

1:45:29.240 --> 1:45:30.760
 Not an integral part of fascism

1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:32.800
 because Mussolini really, I mean,

1:45:32.800 --> 1:45:34.740
 Mussolini did it to please Hitler,

1:45:34.740 --> 1:45:36.800
 but it wasn't an integral part.

1:45:36.800 --> 1:45:40.400
 What's interesting to me is that that's the big anomaly

1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:42.940
 in the whole question because antisemitism

1:45:42.940 --> 1:45:45.680
 didn't need to be a part of this at all, right?

1:45:45.680 --> 1:45:50.320
 Hitler had a conspiratorial view of the world.

1:45:50.320 --> 1:45:53.760
 He was a believer that the Jews controlled things, right?

1:45:53.760 --> 1:45:57.600
 The Jews were responsible for both Bolshevism on one side

1:45:57.600 --> 1:46:00.320
 and capitalism on the other, they ruled the banks.

1:46:00.320 --> 1:46:03.680
 I mean, United States was a Jewified country, right?

1:46:03.680 --> 1:46:08.680
 Bolshevism was a Jewified sort of a political.

1:46:09.200 --> 1:46:11.280
 In other words, he saw Jews everywhere

1:46:11.280 --> 1:46:12.320
 and he had that line about it.

1:46:12.320 --> 1:46:15.920
 The Jews of Europe force another war to Germany,

1:46:15.920 --> 1:46:17.360
 they'll pay the price or whatever,

1:46:17.360 --> 1:46:20.280
 but then you have to believe that they're capable of that.

1:46:20.280 --> 1:46:24.120
 The Holocaust is a weird, weird sidebar to the whole thing.

1:46:24.120 --> 1:46:25.960
 And here's what I've always found interesting.

1:46:25.960 --> 1:46:28.400
 It's a sidebar that weakened Germany

1:46:28.400 --> 1:46:29.720
 because look at the First World War.

1:46:29.720 --> 1:46:31.960
 The Jews fought for Germany, right?

1:46:31.960 --> 1:46:33.640
 Who was the most important?

1:46:34.560 --> 1:46:36.120
 And this is a very arguable point,

1:46:36.120 --> 1:46:38.280
 but it's just the first one that pops into my head.

1:46:38.280 --> 1:46:41.800
 Who was the most important Jewish figure

1:46:41.800 --> 1:46:45.120
 that would have maybe been on the German side

1:46:45.120 --> 1:46:48.360
 had the Germans had a non antisemitic?

1:46:48.360 --> 1:46:49.800
 Well, listen, that whole part.

1:46:49.800 --> 1:46:52.240
 Yes, it was Einstein, but the whole,

1:46:52.240 --> 1:46:55.360
 I should point out that to say Germany or Europe

1:46:55.360 --> 1:46:58.160
 or Russia or any of those things were not antisemitic

1:46:58.160 --> 1:47:00.040
 is to do injustice to history, right?

1:47:00.040 --> 1:47:04.680
 Pogroms, I mean, it's standard operating procedure.

1:47:04.680 --> 1:47:06.760
 What you see in the Hitlerian era

1:47:06.760 --> 1:47:09.080
 is an absolute huge spike, right?

1:47:09.080 --> 1:47:11.200
 Cause the government has a conspiracy theory

1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:12.080
 that the Jews have.

1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:15.120
 It's funny because Hitler both thought of them as weak

1:47:15.120 --> 1:47:17.240
 and super powerful at the same time, right?

1:47:17.240 --> 1:47:20.400
 And as an outsider people that weakened Germany,

1:47:20.400 --> 1:47:21.840
 the whole idea of the blood

1:47:21.840 --> 1:47:23.440
 and how that connects to Darwinism

1:47:23.440 --> 1:47:26.720
 and all that sort of stuff is just weird, right?

1:47:26.720 --> 1:47:29.360
 A real outlier, but Einstein,

1:47:29.360 --> 1:47:31.560
 let's just play with Einstein.

1:47:31.560 --> 1:47:34.760
 If there's no antisemitism in Germany

1:47:34.760 --> 1:47:38.680
 or none above the normal level, right?

1:47:38.680 --> 1:47:41.680
 The baseline level, does Einstein leave

1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:44.840
 along with all the other Jewish scientists?

1:47:44.840 --> 1:47:49.240
 And what does Germany have as increased technological

1:47:49.240 --> 1:47:52.840
 and intellectual capacity if they stay, right?

1:47:52.840 --> 1:47:55.480
 It's something that actually weakened that state.

1:47:55.480 --> 1:47:59.880
 It's a tragic flaw in the Hitlerian worldview,

1:47:59.880 --> 1:48:03.480
 but it was so, and let me, you had mentioned earlier,

1:48:03.480 --> 1:48:06.480
 like maybe it was not integral to his character.

1:48:06.480 --> 1:48:09.320
 Maybe it was a wonderful tool for power.

1:48:09.320 --> 1:48:10.480
 I don't think so.

1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:13.920
 Somewhere along the line, and really not at the beginning,

1:48:13.920 --> 1:48:17.840
 this guy became absolutely obsessed with this.

1:48:17.840 --> 1:48:19.000
 With the conspiracy theory.

1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:22.200
 And Jews, and he surrounded himself

1:48:22.200 --> 1:48:23.880
 with people and theorists.

1:48:23.880 --> 1:48:27.480
 I'm gonna use that word really, really sort of loosely,

1:48:27.480 --> 1:48:28.800
 who believed this too.

1:48:28.800 --> 1:48:30.920
 And so you have a cabal of people

1:48:30.920 --> 1:48:33.200
 who are reinforcing this idea

1:48:33.200 --> 1:48:35.200
 that the Jews control the world.

1:48:35.200 --> 1:48:37.520
 He called it international jewelry

1:48:37.520 --> 1:48:39.160
 was a huge part of the problem.

1:48:39.160 --> 1:48:40.960
 And because of that, they deserved to be punished.

1:48:40.960 --> 1:48:43.680
 They were an enemy within all these kinds of things.

1:48:43.680 --> 1:48:46.420
 It's a nutty conspiracy theory

1:48:46.420 --> 1:48:49.080
 that the government of one of the most,

1:48:49.080 --> 1:48:51.440
 I mean, the big thing with Germany was culture, right?

1:48:51.440 --> 1:48:55.720
 They were a leading figure in culture and philosophy

1:48:55.720 --> 1:48:56.600
 and all these kinds of things.

1:48:56.600 --> 1:48:59.520
 And that they could be overtaken

1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:03.040
 with this wildly wickedly weird conspiracy theory

1:49:03.040 --> 1:49:05.120
 and that it would actually determine things.

1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:08.280
 I mean, Hitler was taking vast amounts of German resources

1:49:08.280 --> 1:49:10.640
 and using it to wipe out this race

1:49:10.640 --> 1:49:12.900
 when he needed them for all kinds of other things

1:49:12.900 --> 1:49:14.640
 to fight a war of annihilation.

1:49:14.640 --> 1:49:19.640
 So that is the weirdest part of the whole Nazi phenomenon.

1:49:19.640 --> 1:49:24.640
 It's the darkest possible silver lining to think about

1:49:25.800 --> 1:49:27.880
 is that the Holocaust may have been

1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:29.920
 and the hatred of the Jewish people

1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:32.600
 may have been the thing that avoided Germany

1:49:32.600 --> 1:49:34.580
 getting the nuclear weapons first.

1:49:35.400 --> 1:49:36.240
 And.

1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:41.280
 Isn't that a wonderful historical ironic twist

1:49:41.280 --> 1:49:43.920
 that if it weren't so overlaid with tragedy,

1:49:43.920 --> 1:49:45.560
 a thousand years from now will be seen

1:49:45.560 --> 1:49:46.760
 as something really kind of funny.

1:49:46.760 --> 1:49:47.840
 Well, that's true.

1:49:47.840 --> 1:49:50.640
 It's fascinating to think as you've talked.

1:49:50.640 --> 1:49:52.480
 So the seeds of his own destruction, right?

1:49:52.480 --> 1:49:53.560
 The tragic flaw.

1:49:55.400 --> 1:49:59.760
 And my hope is, this is a discussion I have

1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:01.600
 with my dad as a physicist,

1:50:04.400 --> 1:50:09.400
 is that evil inherently contains with it

1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:11.440
 that kind of incompetence.

1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:17.400
 So my dad's discussion, so he's a physicist

1:50:17.400 --> 1:50:21.440
 and an engineer, his belief is that at this time

1:50:21.440 --> 1:50:24.120
 in our history, the reason we haven't had nuclear

1:50:24.120 --> 1:50:29.120
 like terrorist blow up a nuclear weapon somewhere

1:50:29.880 --> 1:50:32.920
 in the world is that the kind of people

1:50:32.920 --> 1:50:36.880
 that would be terrorists are simply not competent enough

1:50:38.120 --> 1:50:41.200
 at their job of being a destructive.

1:50:41.200 --> 1:50:43.940
 So like, there's a kind of, if you plot it,

1:50:43.940 --> 1:50:47.920
 the more evil you are, the less able you are.

1:50:47.920 --> 1:50:52.920
 And by evil, I mean, purely just like we said,

1:50:53.240 --> 1:50:56.360
 if we were to consider the hatred of Jewish people as evil,

1:50:56.360 --> 1:50:58.320
 because it's sort of detached from reality,

1:50:58.320 --> 1:51:02.460
 it's like just this pure hatred of something

1:51:02.460 --> 1:51:07.460
 that's grounded on things, conspiracy theories.

1:51:07.660 --> 1:51:11.120
 If that's evil, then the more you sell yourself,

1:51:11.120 --> 1:51:13.820
 the more you give into these conspiracy theories,

1:51:13.820 --> 1:51:16.880
 the less capable you are at actually engineering,

1:51:16.880 --> 1:51:19.160
 which is very difficult, engineering nuclear weapons

1:51:19.160 --> 1:51:20.920
 and effectively deploying them.

1:51:20.920 --> 1:51:25.000
 So that's a hopeful message that the destructive people

1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:30.000
 in this world are by their worldview incompetent

1:51:30.440 --> 1:51:33.800
 in creating the ultimate destruction.

1:51:33.800 --> 1:51:35.120
 I don't agree with that.

1:51:35.120 --> 1:51:35.960
 Oh boy.

1:51:35.960 --> 1:51:37.640
 I straight up don't agree with that.

1:51:37.640 --> 1:51:39.200
 So why are we still here?

1:51:39.200 --> 1:51:41.560
 Why haven't we destroyed ourselves?

1:51:41.560 --> 1:51:45.140
 Why haven't the terrorists blown, it's been many decades.

1:51:45.140 --> 1:51:49.040
 Why haven't we destroyed ourself to this point?

1:51:49.040 --> 1:51:52.400
 Well, when you say it's been many decades, many decades,

1:51:52.400 --> 1:51:56.800
 that's like saying in the life of 150 year old person,

1:51:56.800 --> 1:51:58.880
 we've been doing well for a year.

1:51:58.880 --> 1:52:01.520
 The problem with all these kinds of equations,

1:52:01.520 --> 1:52:02.960
 and it was Bertrand Russell, right?

1:52:02.960 --> 1:52:04.960
 The philosopher who said so.

1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:09.080
 He said, it's unreasonable to expect a man to walk

1:52:09.080 --> 1:52:12.040
 on a tight rope for 50 years.

1:52:12.040 --> 1:52:15.560
 I mean, the problem is that this is a long game.

1:52:15.560 --> 1:52:18.320
 And let's remember that up until relatively recently,

1:52:18.320 --> 1:52:20.480
 what would you say, 30 years ago,

1:52:20.480 --> 1:52:22.620
 the nuclear weapons in the world

1:52:22.620 --> 1:52:24.360
 were really tightly controlled.

1:52:24.360 --> 1:52:25.520
 That was one of the real dangers

1:52:25.520 --> 1:52:26.760
 in the fall of the Soviet Union.

1:52:26.760 --> 1:52:29.660
 Remember the worry that all of a sudden

1:52:29.660 --> 1:52:32.600
 you were gonna have bankrupt former Soviet Republic

1:52:32.600 --> 1:52:35.120
 selling nuclear weapons to terrorists and whatnot.

1:52:35.120 --> 1:52:37.720
 I would suggest, and here's another problem is that

1:52:37.720 --> 1:52:39.540
 when we call these terrorists evil,

1:52:39.540 --> 1:52:42.060
 it's easy for an American, for example,

1:52:42.060 --> 1:52:44.940
 to say that Osama bin Laden is evil.

1:52:44.940 --> 1:52:46.320
 Easy for me to say that.

1:52:46.320 --> 1:52:49.200
 But one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter

1:52:49.200 --> 1:52:52.080
 as the saying goes, and to other people, he's not.

1:52:52.080 --> 1:52:54.740
 What Osama bin Laden did,

1:52:54.740 --> 1:52:56.760
 and the people that worked with him,

1:52:56.760 --> 1:52:58.660
 we would call evil genius.

1:52:58.660 --> 1:53:00.720
 The idea of hijacking planes

1:53:00.720 --> 1:53:02.640
 and flying them into the buildings like that,

1:53:02.640 --> 1:53:04.720
 and that he could pull that off,

1:53:04.720 --> 1:53:07.400
 and that still boggles my mind.

1:53:07.400 --> 1:53:10.720
 I'm still, it's funny, I'm still stunned by that.

1:53:10.720 --> 1:53:14.080
 And yet, the idea, here's the funny part,

1:53:14.080 --> 1:53:16.560
 and I hesitate to talk about this

1:53:16.560 --> 1:53:19.560
 because I don't wanna give anyone ideas,

1:53:19.560 --> 1:53:22.720
 but you don't need nuclear weapons

1:53:22.720 --> 1:53:26.320
 to do incredibly grave amounts of danger.

1:53:26.320 --> 1:53:30.560
 I mean, what one can of gasoline and a BIC lighter can do

1:53:30.560 --> 1:53:33.440
 in the right place and the right time,

1:53:33.440 --> 1:53:36.640
 and over and over and over again

1:53:36.640 --> 1:53:38.440
 can bring down societies.

1:53:38.440 --> 1:53:42.120
 This is the argument behind the importance of the stability

1:53:42.120 --> 1:53:44.240
 that a nation state provides.

1:53:44.240 --> 1:53:48.640
 So when we went in and took out Saddam Hussein,

1:53:48.640 --> 1:53:50.400
 one of the great counter arguments

1:53:50.400 --> 1:53:51.560
 from some of the people who said,

1:53:51.560 --> 1:53:53.600
 this is a really stupid thing to do,

1:53:53.600 --> 1:53:57.300
 is that Saddam Hussein was the greatest anti terror weapon

1:53:57.300 --> 1:53:59.040
 in that region that you could have

1:53:59.040 --> 1:54:01.400
 because they were a threat to him.

1:54:01.400 --> 1:54:03.640
 So he took that, and he did it in a way

1:54:03.640 --> 1:54:07.120
 that was much more repressive than we would ever be, right?

1:54:07.120 --> 1:54:08.160
 And this is the old line

1:54:08.160 --> 1:54:12.480
 about why we supported right wing death squad countries,

1:54:12.480 --> 1:54:14.720
 because they were taking out people

1:54:14.720 --> 1:54:18.280
 that would inevitably be a problem for us if they didn't,

1:54:18.280 --> 1:54:19.720
 and they were able to do it

1:54:19.720 --> 1:54:21.920
 in a way we would never be able to do, supposedly.

1:54:21.920 --> 1:54:23.560
 We're pretty good at that stuff,

1:54:23.560 --> 1:54:25.640
 just like the Soviet Union was behind the scenes

1:54:25.640 --> 1:54:27.020
 and underneath the radar.

1:54:27.020 --> 1:54:29.960
 But the idea that the stability created

1:54:29.960 --> 1:54:32.760
 by powerful and strong centralized leadership

1:54:32.760 --> 1:54:35.920
 allowed them, it's almost like outsourcing

1:54:35.920 --> 1:54:38.520
 anti terror activities, allowed them to,

1:54:38.520 --> 1:54:39.680
 for their own reasons.

1:54:39.680 --> 1:54:41.080
 I mean, you see the same thing

1:54:41.080 --> 1:54:42.820
 in the Syria situation with the Assads.

1:54:42.820 --> 1:54:46.200
 I mean, you can't have an ISIS in that area

1:54:46.200 --> 1:54:48.040
 because that's a threat to the Assad government

1:54:48.040 --> 1:54:49.680
 who will take care of that for you,

1:54:49.680 --> 1:54:51.840
 and then that helps us by not having an ISIS.

1:54:51.840 --> 1:54:56.520
 So I would suggest one, that the game is still on

1:54:56.520 --> 1:54:59.000
 on whether or not these people get nuclear weapons

1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:00.320
 in their hands.

1:55:00.320 --> 1:55:02.080
 I would suggest they don't need them

1:55:02.080 --> 1:55:03.700
 to achieve their goals, really.

1:55:05.340 --> 1:55:06.840
 The crazy thing is if you start thinking

1:55:06.840 --> 1:55:10.200
 like the Joker in Batman, the terrorist ideas,

1:55:10.200 --> 1:55:12.000
 it's funny, I guess I would be a great terrorist

1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:13.460
 because I'm just full of those ideas.

1:55:13.460 --> 1:55:14.920
 Oh, you could do this, you could,

1:55:14.920 --> 1:55:17.480
 it's scary to think of how vulnerable we are.

1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:22.320
 But the whole point is that you as the Joker

1:55:22.320 --> 1:55:24.740
 wouldn't do the terrorist actions.

1:55:24.740 --> 1:55:29.280
 That's the theory that's so hopeful to me with my dad,

1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:33.640
 is that all the ideas, your ability to generate good ideas,

1:55:33.640 --> 1:55:37.200
 forget nuclear weapons, how you can disrupt the power grid,

1:55:37.200 --> 1:55:41.040
 how you can disrupt the, attack our psychology,

1:55:41.960 --> 1:55:44.960
 attack like with a can of gasoline, like you said,

1:55:44.960 --> 1:55:48.060
 somehow disrupt the American system of ideas.

1:55:49.800 --> 1:55:53.720
 That coming up with good ideas there.

1:55:53.720 --> 1:55:55.600
 Are we saying evil people can't come up

1:55:55.600 --> 1:55:57.480
 with evil genius ideas?

1:55:57.480 --> 1:55:58.600
 That's what I'm saying.

1:55:58.600 --> 1:56:00.040
 We have this Hollywood story.

1:56:00.040 --> 1:56:02.320
 I don't think history backs that up.

1:56:02.320 --> 1:56:04.000
 I mean, I think you can say with the nuclear weapons,

1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.320
 it does, but only because they're so recent.

1:56:06.320 --> 1:56:10.040
 But I mean, evil genius, I mean, that's almost proverbial.

1:56:10.040 --> 1:56:13.720
 But that's, okay, so to push back for the fun of it, or.

1:56:13.720 --> 1:56:15.400
 And I don't mean to, I don't want you to leave this

1:56:15.400 --> 1:56:17.800
 in a terrible mood because I push back

1:56:17.800 --> 1:56:20.040
 on every hopeful idea you had,

1:56:20.040 --> 1:56:22.360
 but I tend to be a little cynical about that stuff.

1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:26.680
 But that goes to the definition of evil, I think,

1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:29.840
 because I'm not so sure human history

1:56:29.840 --> 1:56:33.440
 has a lot of evil people being competent.

1:56:33.440 --> 1:56:36.600
 I do believe that they mostly,

1:56:36.600 --> 1:56:38.920
 like in order to be good at doing

1:56:38.920 --> 1:56:40.680
 what may be perceived as evil,

1:56:40.680 --> 1:56:43.840
 you have to be able to construct an ideology

1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:45.880
 around which you truly believe

1:56:45.880 --> 1:56:49.040
 when you look in the mirror by yourself,

1:56:49.040 --> 1:56:51.220
 that you're doing good for the world.

1:56:51.220 --> 1:56:54.560
 And it's difficult to construct an ideology

1:56:54.560 --> 1:56:59.000
 where destroying the lives of millions

1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:01.120
 or disrupting the American system,

1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:03.240
 I'm already contradicting myself as I'm saying.

1:57:03.240 --> 1:57:05.760
 I was just gonna say, people have done this already, yes.

1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:09.560
 So, but then it's the question of like,

1:57:09.560 --> 1:57:12.560
 about aliens with the idea that

1:57:16.180 --> 1:57:18.080
 if the aliens are all out there,

1:57:18.080 --> 1:57:20.340
 why haven't they visited us?

1:57:20.340 --> 1:57:25.000
 The same question, if it's so easy to be evil,

1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:27.160
 not easy, if it's possible to be evil,

1:57:27.160 --> 1:57:29.160
 why haven't we destroyed ourselves?

1:57:29.160 --> 1:57:32.320
 And your statement is from the context of history,

1:57:33.180 --> 1:57:34.840
 the game is still on.

1:57:34.840 --> 1:57:37.280
 And it's just been a few years

1:57:37.280 --> 1:57:40.320
 since we've found the tools to destroy ourselves.

1:57:40.320 --> 1:57:44.140
 And one of the challenges of our modern time

1:57:44.140 --> 1:57:46.200
 that we don't often think about this pandemic

1:57:46.200 --> 1:57:49.660
 kind of revealed is how soft we've gotten

1:57:49.660 --> 1:57:53.680
 in terms of our deep dependence on the system.

1:57:53.680 --> 1:57:56.760
 So somebody mentioned to me,

1:57:56.760 --> 1:57:59.280
 what happens if power goes out for a day?

1:57:59.280 --> 1:58:04.000
 What happens if power goes out for a month?

1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:06.040
 Oh, for example, the person that mentioned this

1:58:06.040 --> 1:58:10.200
 was a Berkeley faculty that I was talking with.

1:58:10.200 --> 1:58:13.440
 He's an astronomer who's observing solar flares.

1:58:13.440 --> 1:58:16.960
 And it's very possible that a solar flare,

1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:19.480
 they happen all the time to different degrees.

1:58:19.480 --> 1:58:20.720
 To knock out your cell phones.

1:58:20.720 --> 1:58:24.820
 Yeah, to knock out the power grid for months.

1:58:25.800 --> 1:58:29.200
 So like, just as a thought experiment,

1:58:29.200 --> 1:58:31.040
 what happens if just power goes out

1:58:31.040 --> 1:58:33.720
 for a week in this country?

1:58:33.720 --> 1:58:37.660
 Like the electromagnetic pulses and the nuclear weapons

1:58:37.660 --> 1:58:38.920
 and all those kinds of things, yeah.

1:58:38.920 --> 1:58:41.640
 But maybe that's an act of nature.

1:58:41.640 --> 1:58:44.880
 And even just the act of nature will reveal

1:58:46.160 --> 1:58:48.640
 like a little. The fragility of it all.

1:58:48.640 --> 1:58:50.040
 And then the evil can emerge.

1:58:50.040 --> 1:58:51.560
 I mean, the kind of things that might happen

1:58:51.560 --> 1:58:56.200
 when power goes out, especially during a divisive time.

1:58:56.200 --> 1:58:57.280
 Well, you won't have food.

1:58:57.280 --> 1:59:00.420
 At baseline level, that would mean

1:59:00.420 --> 1:59:04.640
 that the entire supplies chain begins to break down.

1:59:04.640 --> 1:59:06.000
 And then you have desperation.

1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:08.240
 And desperation opens the door to everything.

1:59:09.340 --> 1:59:10.960
 Can I ask a dark question?

1:59:10.960 --> 1:59:13.720
 As opposed to the other things we've been talking about?

1:59:13.720 --> 1:59:16.360
 There's always a thread, a hopeful message.

1:59:16.360 --> 1:59:18.400
 I think there'll be a hopeful message on this one too.

1:59:18.400 --> 1:59:19.640
 You may have the wrong guess.

1:59:19.640 --> 1:59:20.900
 I'm just saying.

1:59:23.320 --> 1:59:26.820
 If you were to bet money on the way

1:59:26.820 --> 1:59:31.000
 that human civilization destroys itself,

1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:35.280
 or it collapses in some way that is,

1:59:35.280 --> 1:59:38.160
 where the result would be unrecognizable to us

1:59:38.160 --> 1:59:42.980
 as anything akin to progress, what would you say?

1:59:42.980 --> 1:59:46.480
 Is it nuclear weapons?

1:59:46.480 --> 1:59:48.840
 Is it some societal breakdown

1:59:48.840 --> 1:59:51.560
 through just more traditional kinds of war?

1:59:51.560 --> 1:59:54.520
 Is it engineered pandemics, nanotechnology?

1:59:54.520 --> 1:59:56.600
 Is it artificial intelligence?

1:59:56.600 --> 1:59:59.040
 Is it something we can't even expect yet?

1:59:59.040 --> 2:00:02.680
 Do you have a sense of how we humans will destroy ourselves?

2:00:02.680 --> 2:00:04.800
 Or might we live forever?

2:00:04.800 --> 2:00:08.720
 I think what governs my view of this thing

2:00:08.720 --> 2:00:13.240
 is the ability for us to focus ourselves collectively.

2:00:13.240 --> 2:00:15.800
 And that gives me the choice of looking at this

2:00:15.800 --> 2:00:19.680
 and saying, what are the odds we will do X versus Y, right?

2:00:20.680 --> 2:00:24.000
 So go look at the 62 Cuban Missile Crisis,

2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:28.000
 where we looked at the potential of nuclear war

2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:30.600
 and we stared right in the face of that.

2:00:30.600 --> 2:00:32.440
 To me, I consider that to be,

2:00:32.440 --> 2:00:34.820
 you wanna talk about a hopeful moment?

2:00:34.820 --> 2:00:36.920
 That's one of the rare times in our history

2:00:36.920 --> 2:00:41.240
 where I think the odds were overwhelmingly

2:00:41.240 --> 2:00:43.280
 that there would be a nuclear war.

2:00:43.280 --> 2:00:46.720
 And I'm not the super Kennedy worshiper that,

2:00:46.720 --> 2:00:48.360
 I grew up in an era where he was,

2:00:48.360 --> 2:00:50.920
 especially amongst people in the Democratic Party,

2:00:50.920 --> 2:00:52.000
 he was almost worshiped.

2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:54.880
 And I was never that guy, but I will say something.

2:00:54.880 --> 2:00:59.880
 John F. Kennedy by himself probably made decisions

2:01:00.120 --> 2:01:02.760
 that saved a hundred million or more lives

2:01:02.760 --> 2:01:06.400
 because everyone around him thought he should be

2:01:06.400 --> 2:01:08.760
 taking the road that would have led to those deaths.

2:01:08.760 --> 2:01:11.400
 And to push back against that is,

2:01:11.400 --> 2:01:12.920
 when you look at it now, I mean, again,

2:01:12.920 --> 2:01:13.920
 if you were a betting person,

2:01:13.920 --> 2:01:15.240
 you would have bet against that.

2:01:15.240 --> 2:01:16.640
 And that's rare, right?

2:01:17.840 --> 2:01:22.480
 So when we talk about how the world will end,

2:01:22.480 --> 2:01:26.400
 the fact that one person actually had that in their hands

2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:29.120
 meant that it wasn't a collective decision.

2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:30.240
 It gave, remember I said,

2:01:30.240 --> 2:01:32.060
 I trust people on an individual level,

2:01:32.060 --> 2:01:34.120
 but when we get together, we're more like a herd

2:01:34.120 --> 2:01:36.640
 and we devolved down to the lowest common denominator.

2:01:36.640 --> 2:01:40.520
 That was something where the higher ethical ideas

2:01:40.520 --> 2:01:42.720
 of a single human being could come into play

2:01:42.720 --> 2:01:46.320
 and make the decisions that influence the events.

2:01:46.320 --> 2:01:48.760
 But when we have to act collectively,

2:01:48.760 --> 2:01:50.280
 I get a lot more pessimistic.

2:01:50.280 --> 2:01:53.720
 So take what we're doing to the planet.

2:01:53.720 --> 2:01:56.560
 And we talk about it always now in terms of climate change,

2:01:56.560 --> 2:01:59.240
 which I think is far too narrow.

2:01:59.240 --> 2:02:02.720
 Look at, and I always get very frustrated

2:02:02.720 --> 2:02:04.040
 when we talk about these arguments about,

2:02:04.040 --> 2:02:04.880
 is it happening?

2:02:04.880 --> 2:02:05.720
 Is it human?

2:02:05.720 --> 2:02:09.940
 Just look at the trash, forget climate for a second.

2:02:09.940 --> 2:02:12.840
 We are destroying the planet because we're not taking care

2:02:12.840 --> 2:02:14.980
 of it and because what it would do to take care of it

2:02:14.980 --> 2:02:17.640
 would require collective sacrifices

2:02:17.640 --> 2:02:21.480
 that would require enough of us to say, okay.

2:02:21.480 --> 2:02:24.640
 And we can't get enough of us to say, okay,

2:02:24.640 --> 2:02:27.040
 because too many people have to be on board.

2:02:27.040 --> 2:02:30.640
 It's not John F. Kennedy making one decision from one man.

2:02:30.640 --> 2:02:34.720
 We have to have 85% of us or something around the world.

2:02:34.720 --> 2:02:37.720
 Not just, you can't say we're gonna stop doing damage

2:02:37.720 --> 2:02:41.400
 to the world here in the United States if China does it.

2:02:41.400 --> 2:02:43.800
 So the amount of people that have to get on board

2:02:43.800 --> 2:02:46.560
 that train is hard.

2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:49.900
 You get pessimistic hoping for those kinds of shifts

2:02:49.900 --> 2:02:54.040
 unless it's right, you know, Krypton's about to explode.

2:02:54.040 --> 2:02:57.460
 We have, and so I think if you're talking

2:02:57.460 --> 2:03:00.360
 about a gambling man's view of this,

2:03:00.360 --> 2:03:02.340
 that that's gotta be the odds on favorite

2:03:02.340 --> 2:03:05.320
 because it requires such a UNAM.

2:03:05.320 --> 2:03:09.160
 I mean, and the systems maybe aren't even in place, right?

2:03:09.160 --> 2:03:12.080
 The fact that we would need intergovernmental bodies

2:03:12.080 --> 2:03:14.500
 that are completely discredited now on board

2:03:14.500 --> 2:03:17.760
 and you would have to subvert the national interests

2:03:17.760 --> 2:03:20.340
 of nation states, I mean, the amount of things

2:03:20.340 --> 2:03:23.960
 that have to go right in a short period of time

2:03:23.960 --> 2:03:27.560
 where we don't have 600 years to figure this out, right?

2:03:27.560 --> 2:03:30.160
 So to me, that looks like the most likely

2:03:30.160 --> 2:03:31.760
 just because the things we would have to do

2:03:31.760 --> 2:03:33.640
 to avoid it seem the most unlikely.

2:03:33.640 --> 2:03:34.480
 Does that make sense?

2:03:34.480 --> 2:03:35.440
 Absolutely.

2:03:35.440 --> 2:03:38.360
 I believe, call me naive,

2:03:38.360 --> 2:03:41.400
 in just like you said with the individual,

2:03:41.400 --> 2:03:43.800
 I believe that charismatic leaders,

2:03:43.800 --> 2:03:46.120
 individual leaders will save us.

2:03:46.120 --> 2:03:46.960
 Like this.

2:03:46.960 --> 2:03:48.480
 What if you don't get them all at the same time?

2:03:48.480 --> 2:03:50.520
 What if you get a charismatic leader in one country

2:03:50.520 --> 2:03:52.380
 but under, or what if you get a charismatic leader

2:03:52.380 --> 2:03:54.440
 in a country that doesn't really matter that much?

2:03:54.440 --> 2:03:55.840
 Well, it's a ripple effect.

2:03:55.840 --> 2:03:57.400
 So it starts with one leader

2:03:57.400 --> 2:04:00.840
 and their charisma inspires other leaders.

2:04:00.840 --> 2:04:05.160
 So it's like one ant queen steps up

2:04:05.160 --> 2:04:07.280
 and then the rest of the ant starts behaving.

2:04:07.280 --> 2:04:09.220
 And then there's like little other spikes

2:04:09.220 --> 2:04:11.120
 of leaders that emerge.

2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:13.080
 And then that's where collaboration emerges.

2:04:13.080 --> 2:04:16.240
 I tend to believe that like when you heat up the system

2:04:16.240 --> 2:04:21.040
 and shit starts getting really chaotic,

2:04:21.040 --> 2:04:24.600
 then the leader, whatever this collective intelligence

2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:27.980
 that we've developed, the leader will emerge.

2:04:27.980 --> 2:04:28.820
 Like there.

2:04:28.820 --> 2:04:30.400
 Don't you think there's just as much of a chance though

2:04:30.400 --> 2:04:31.760
 that the leader would emerge and say,

2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:33.960
 the Jews are the people who did all this.

2:04:33.960 --> 2:04:34.800
 You know what I'm saying?

2:04:34.800 --> 2:04:36.920
 Is that the idea that they would come up,

2:04:36.920 --> 2:04:37.880
 you have a charismatic leader

2:04:37.880 --> 2:04:39.440
 and he's going to come up with the rights

2:04:39.440 --> 2:04:41.660
 or she is going to come up with the right solution

2:04:41.660 --> 2:04:45.360
 as opposed to totally coming up with the wrong solution.

2:04:45.360 --> 2:04:47.580
 I mean, I guess what I'm saying is you could be right,

2:04:47.580 --> 2:04:50.080
 but a lot of things have to go the right way.

2:04:50.080 --> 2:04:52.880
 But my intuition about the evolutionary process

2:04:52.880 --> 2:04:55.520
 that led to the creation of human intelligence

2:04:55.520 --> 2:04:58.820
 and consciousness on earth results

2:04:58.820 --> 2:05:02.400
 in the power of like, if we think of it,

2:05:02.400 --> 2:05:05.480
 just the love in the system versus the hate in the system,

2:05:05.480 --> 2:05:07.480
 that the love is greater.

2:05:07.480 --> 2:05:12.480
 The human kindness potential in the system

2:05:13.780 --> 2:05:18.200
 is greater than the human hatred potential.

2:05:18.200 --> 2:05:21.800
 And so the leader that is in the time when it's needed,

2:05:21.800 --> 2:05:25.960
 the leader that inspires love and kindness

2:05:25.960 --> 2:05:30.560
 is more likely to emerge and will have more power.

2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:34.160
 So you have the Hitlers of the world that emerge,

2:05:34.160 --> 2:05:37.840
 but they're actually in a grand scheme of history

2:05:37.840 --> 2:05:40.680
 are not that impactful.

2:05:40.680 --> 2:05:42.840
 So it's weird to say,

2:05:42.840 --> 2:05:45.840
 but not that many people died in World War II.

2:05:45.840 --> 2:05:50.840
 If you look at the full range of human history,

2:05:51.800 --> 2:05:55.680
 it's up to a hundred million, whatever that is,

2:05:55.680 --> 2:05:57.000
 with natural pandemics too,

2:05:57.000 --> 2:05:58.400
 you can have those kinds of numbers,

2:05:58.400 --> 2:06:00.160
 but it's still a percentage.

2:06:00.160 --> 2:06:01.220
 I forget what the percentage is,

2:06:01.220 --> 2:06:04.600
 maybe three, 5% of the human population on earth.

2:06:04.600 --> 2:06:07.160
 Maybe it's a little bit focused on a different region,

2:06:07.160 --> 2:06:09.040
 but it's not destructive

2:06:09.040 --> 2:06:11.840
 to the entirety of human civilization.

2:06:11.840 --> 2:06:16.840
 So I believe that the charismatic leaders,

2:06:17.700 --> 2:06:22.180
 when time is needed, that do good for the world

2:06:22.180 --> 2:06:24.680
 in the broader sense of good

2:06:24.680 --> 2:06:26.000
 are more likely to emerge

2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:28.260
 than the ones that say, kill all the Jews.

2:06:29.440 --> 2:06:32.000
 It's possible though, and this is just,

2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:33.640
 I've thought about this all of 30 seconds,

2:06:33.640 --> 2:06:36.160
 but I mean, it seems.

2:06:36.160 --> 2:06:38.440
 We're betting money here on the 21st century,

2:06:38.440 --> 2:06:39.280
 who's gonna win?

2:06:39.280 --> 2:06:42.560
 I think maybe you've divided this

2:06:42.560 --> 2:06:45.680
 into too much of a black and white dichotomy,

2:06:45.680 --> 2:06:48.640
 this love and good on one side and this evil on another.

2:06:48.640 --> 2:06:50.760
 Let me throw something that might be more

2:06:50.760 --> 2:06:54.800
 in the center of that linear balancing act,

2:06:54.800 --> 2:06:59.680
 self interest, which may or may not be good.

2:06:59.680 --> 2:07:02.960
 The good version of it we call enlightened self interest.

2:07:02.960 --> 2:07:05.920
 The bad version of it we call selfishness.

2:07:05.920 --> 2:07:09.600
 But self interest to me seems like something more likely

2:07:09.600 --> 2:07:13.180
 to impact the outcome than either love on one side

2:07:13.180 --> 2:07:14.840
 or evil on the other.

2:07:14.840 --> 2:07:17.480
 Simply a question of what's good for me

2:07:17.480 --> 2:07:19.280
 or what's good for my country

2:07:19.280 --> 2:07:21.120
 or what's good from my point of view

2:07:21.120 --> 2:07:22.980
 or what's good for my business.

2:07:22.980 --> 2:07:27.980
 I mean, if you tell me, and maybe I'm a coal miner

2:07:27.980 --> 2:07:29.780
 or maybe I own a coal mine.

2:07:29.780 --> 2:07:32.680
 If you say to me, we have to stop using coal

2:07:32.680 --> 2:07:34.100
 because it's hurting the earth,

2:07:34.100 --> 2:07:39.100
 I have a hard time disentangling that greater good question

2:07:39.700 --> 2:07:43.760
 from my right now good feeding my family question, right?

2:07:43.760 --> 2:07:48.280
 So I think maybe it's gonna be a much more banal thing

2:07:48.280 --> 2:07:50.800
 than good and evil, much more a question

2:07:50.800 --> 2:07:54.400
 of we're not all going to decide at the same time

2:07:54.400 --> 2:07:57.520
 that the interests that we have are aligned.

2:07:57.520 --> 2:07:58.360
 Does that make sense?

2:07:58.360 --> 2:08:00.740
 Totally, but I mean, I've looked at Ayn Rand

2:08:00.740 --> 2:08:02.780
 and objectivism and kind of really thought like,

2:08:02.780 --> 2:08:04.480
 how bad or good can things go

2:08:04.480 --> 2:08:06.640
 when everybody's acting selfishly?

2:08:06.640 --> 2:08:08.880
 But I think we're just talking two aunts here

2:08:08.880 --> 2:08:10.780
 with microphones talking about.

2:08:13.320 --> 2:08:17.800
 But like the question is when this spreads,

2:08:17.800 --> 2:08:22.800
 so what do I mean by love and kindness?

2:08:23.080 --> 2:08:26.680
 I think it's human flourishing on earth

2:08:26.680 --> 2:08:28.920
 and throughout the cosmos.

2:08:28.920 --> 2:08:33.920
 It feels like whatever the engine that drives human beings

2:08:33.960 --> 2:08:37.240
 is more likely to result in human flourishing.

2:08:37.240 --> 2:08:41.240
 And people like Hitler are not good for human flourishing.

2:08:41.240 --> 2:08:45.280
 So that's what I mean by good is there's a,

2:08:45.280 --> 2:08:48.840
 I mean, maybe it's an intuition that kindness

2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:51.600
 is an evolutionary advantage.

2:08:51.600 --> 2:08:52.680
 I hate those terms.

2:08:52.680 --> 2:08:55.920
 I hate to reduce stuff to evolutionary biology always,

2:08:55.920 --> 2:08:58.560
 but it just seems like for us to multiply

2:08:58.560 --> 2:09:03.120
 throughout the universe, it's good to be kind to each other.

2:09:03.120 --> 2:09:06.880
 And those leaders will always emerge to save us

2:09:06.880 --> 2:09:09.200
 from the Hitlers of the world that wanna kind of

2:09:09.200 --> 2:09:11.360
 burn the thing down with a flamethrower.

2:09:11.360 --> 2:09:12.280
 That's the intuition.

2:09:12.280 --> 2:09:14.920
 But let's talk about, you brought up evolution several times.

2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:17.080
 Let me play with that for a minute.

2:09:18.280 --> 2:09:20.400
 I think going back to animal times,

2:09:20.400 --> 2:09:24.360
 we are conditioned to deal with overwhelming threats

2:09:24.360 --> 2:09:25.200
 right in front of us.

2:09:25.200 --> 2:09:28.560
 So I have quite a bit of faith in humanity

2:09:28.560 --> 2:09:33.560
 when it comes to impending doom right outside our door.

2:09:33.920 --> 2:09:35.880
 If Krypton's about to explode,

2:09:35.880 --> 2:09:39.880
 I think humanity can rouse themselves to great,

2:09:39.880 --> 2:09:42.320
 and would give power to the people who needed it

2:09:42.320 --> 2:09:44.360
 and be willing to make the sacrifices.

2:09:44.360 --> 2:09:45.640
 But that's what makes, I think,

2:09:45.640 --> 2:09:47.760
 the pollution slash climate change

2:09:47.760 --> 2:09:51.280
 slash screwing up your environment threat

2:09:51.280 --> 2:09:55.200
 so particularly insidious is it happens slowly, right?

2:09:55.200 --> 2:09:58.080
 It defies fight and flight mechanisms.

2:09:58.080 --> 2:10:01.080
 It defies the natural ability we have to deal

2:10:01.080 --> 2:10:03.840
 with the threat that's right on top of us.

2:10:03.840 --> 2:10:06.280
 And it requires an amount of foresight

2:10:06.280 --> 2:10:09.160
 that while some people would be fine with that,

2:10:09.160 --> 2:10:12.000
 most people are too worried and understandably,

2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:14.840
 I think too worried about today's threat

2:10:14.840 --> 2:10:18.560
 rather than next generation's threat or whatever it might be.

2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:20.600
 So I mean, when we talk about when you had said,

2:10:20.600 --> 2:10:23.040
 what do you think the greatest threat is?

2:10:23.040 --> 2:10:24.400
 I think with nuclear weapons,

2:10:24.400 --> 2:10:26.400
 I think could we have a nuclear war?

2:10:26.400 --> 2:10:27.360
 We darn right could,

2:10:27.360 --> 2:10:31.000
 but I think that there's enough of an inertia

2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:34.800
 where against that because people understand instinctively,

2:10:34.800 --> 2:10:37.680
 if I decide to launch this attack against China

2:10:37.680 --> 2:10:38.960
 and I'm India,

2:10:38.960 --> 2:10:41.600
 we're gonna have 50 million dead people tomorrow.

2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:42.800
 Whereas if you say,

2:10:42.800 --> 2:10:44.800
 we're gonna have a whole planet of dead people

2:10:44.800 --> 2:10:47.520
 in three generations if we don't start now,

2:10:47.520 --> 2:10:52.520
 I think the evolutionary way that we have evolved

2:10:53.840 --> 2:10:55.520
 mitigates maybe against that.

2:10:55.520 --> 2:10:58.440
 In other words, I think I would be pleasantly surprised

2:10:58.440 --> 2:10:59.720
 if we could pull that off.

2:10:59.720 --> 2:11:01.320
 Does that make sense?

2:11:01.320 --> 2:11:02.160
 Totally.

2:11:02.160 --> 2:11:05.280
 I don't mean to be like, I'm the sight predicting doom.

2:11:05.280 --> 2:11:06.120
 It's fun that way.

2:11:06.120 --> 2:11:07.480
 I think we're both,

2:11:07.480 --> 2:11:09.240
 maybe I'm over the top on the love thing.

2:11:09.240 --> 2:11:11.480
 Maybe I'm over the top on the doom.

2:11:11.480 --> 2:11:14.560
 So it makes for a fun chat, I think.

2:11:14.560 --> 2:11:17.440
 So one guy that I've talked to several times

2:11:17.440 --> 2:11:22.080
 is slowly becoming a friend is a guy named Elon Musk.

2:11:22.080 --> 2:11:24.720
 He's a big fan of hardcore history,

2:11:26.320 --> 2:11:29.560
 especially Genghis Khan series of episodes,

2:11:29.560 --> 2:11:31.240
 but really all of it,

2:11:31.240 --> 2:11:34.840
 him and his girlfriend Grimes listen to it, which is.

2:11:34.840 --> 2:11:35.840
 I know Elon.

2:11:35.840 --> 2:11:36.720
 Yeah, you know Elon?

2:11:36.720 --> 2:11:37.560
 Okay, awesome.

2:11:37.560 --> 2:11:40.360
 So that's like relationship goals,

2:11:40.360 --> 2:11:42.480
 like listen to hardcore history on the weekend

2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:43.600
 with your loved one.

2:11:43.600 --> 2:11:44.960
 Okay.

2:11:44.960 --> 2:11:47.520
 So let me, if I were to look at the guy

2:11:48.360 --> 2:11:51.320
 from a perspective of human history,

2:11:51.320 --> 2:11:55.960
 it feels like he will be a little speck that's remembered.

2:11:55.960 --> 2:11:56.920
 Oh, absolutely.

2:11:56.920 --> 2:11:58.320
 You think about like the people,

2:11:58.320 --> 2:12:00.960
 what will we remember from our time?

2:12:01.840 --> 2:12:03.760
 Who are the people we'll remember,

2:12:03.760 --> 2:12:07.840
 whether it's the Hitlers or the Einsteins,

2:12:07.840 --> 2:12:09.240
 who's going to be?

2:12:09.240 --> 2:12:11.560
 It's hard to predict when you're in it,

2:12:11.560 --> 2:12:13.320
 but it seems like Elon

2:12:13.320 --> 2:12:14.880
 will be one of those people remembered.

2:12:14.880 --> 2:12:17.920
 And if I were to guess what he's remembered for,

2:12:17.920 --> 2:12:20.760
 it's the work he's doing with SpaceX

2:12:20.760 --> 2:12:23.800
 and potentially being the person.

2:12:23.800 --> 2:12:24.800
 Now we don't know,

2:12:24.800 --> 2:12:26.800
 but the being the person

2:12:26.800 --> 2:12:31.800
 who launched a new era of space exploration.

2:12:31.840 --> 2:12:34.280
 If we look centuries from now,

2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:37.200
 if we are successful as human beings surviving long enough

2:12:37.200 --> 2:12:42.200
 to venture out into the, you know, toward the stars.

2:12:43.120 --> 2:12:44.560
 It's weird to ask you this.

2:12:44.560 --> 2:12:46.480
 I don't know what your opinions are,

2:12:46.480 --> 2:12:51.400
 but do you think humans will be a multi planetary species

2:12:51.400 --> 2:12:53.760
 in the long arc of history?

2:12:53.760 --> 2:12:56.240
 Do you think Elon will be successful in his dream?

2:12:56.240 --> 2:12:59.840
 And he doesn't shy away from saying it this way, right?

2:12:59.840 --> 2:13:04.680
 He really wants us to colonize Mars first

2:13:04.680 --> 2:13:08.320
 and then colonize other Earth like planets

2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:11.400
 in other solar systems throughout the galaxy.

2:13:11.400 --> 2:13:13.560
 Do you have a hope that we humans will venture out

2:13:13.560 --> 2:13:14.600
 towards the stars?

2:13:15.440 --> 2:13:16.480
 So here's the thing.

2:13:16.480 --> 2:13:17.960
 And this actually, again, dovetails

2:13:17.960 --> 2:13:19.920
 to what we were talking about earlier.

2:13:19.920 --> 2:13:24.080
 I actually, first of all, I toured SpaceX

2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:27.360
 and it's hard to get your mind around

2:13:27.360 --> 2:13:30.080
 because he's doing what it took governments to do before.

2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:30.920
 Yes. Okay.

2:13:30.920 --> 2:13:33.800
 So it's incredible that we're watching individual companies

2:13:33.800 --> 2:13:34.880
 and stuff doing this.

2:13:34.880 --> 2:13:35.960
 Doing it faster and cheaper.

2:13:35.960 --> 2:13:38.720
 Yeah. Well, and pushing the envelope, right?

2:13:38.720 --> 2:13:40.760
 Faster than the governments at the time we're moving.

2:13:40.760 --> 2:13:42.440
 It really is.

2:13:42.440 --> 2:13:45.240
 I mean, there's a lot of people who I think,

2:13:45.240 --> 2:13:49.560
 who think Elon is overrated and you have no idea, right?

2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:51.800
 When you go see it, you have no idea.

2:13:51.800 --> 2:13:54.360
 But that's actually not what I'm most impressed with.

2:13:55.680 --> 2:13:57.720
 It's Tesla I'm most impressed with.

2:13:57.720 --> 2:14:00.560
 And the reason why is because in my mind,

2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:02.920
 we just talked about what I think is the greatest threat,

2:14:02.920 --> 2:14:04.160
 the environmental stuff.

2:14:04.160 --> 2:14:08.280
 And I talked about our inability maybe all at the same time

2:14:08.280 --> 2:14:11.600
 to be willing to sacrifice our self interests

2:14:11.600 --> 2:14:13.320
 in order for the goal.

2:14:14.480 --> 2:14:16.400
 And I don't wanna put words in Elon's mouth,

2:14:16.400 --> 2:14:18.200
 so you can talk to him if you want to.

2:14:18.200 --> 2:14:22.880
 But in my mind, what he's done is recognize that problem.

2:14:22.880 --> 2:14:25.440
 And instead of building a car that's a piece of crap,

2:14:25.440 --> 2:14:27.760
 but it's good for the environment so you should drive it,

2:14:27.760 --> 2:14:31.880
 he's trying to create a car that if you're only motivated

2:14:31.880 --> 2:14:35.240
 by your self interest, you'll buy it anyway.

2:14:35.240 --> 2:14:38.080
 And it will help the environment and help us transition away

2:14:38.080 --> 2:14:40.760
 from one of the main causes of damage.

2:14:40.760 --> 2:14:42.960
 I mean, one of the things this pandemic

2:14:42.960 --> 2:14:45.640
 and the shutdown around the world has done

2:14:45.640 --> 2:14:48.040
 is show us how amazingly quickly

2:14:48.040 --> 2:14:49.720
 the earth can actually rejuvenate.

2:14:49.720 --> 2:14:52.040
 We're seeing clear skies in places species come

2:14:52.040 --> 2:14:54.400
 and you would have thought it would have taken decades

2:14:54.400 --> 2:14:55.720
 for some of this stuff.

2:14:55.720 --> 2:14:59.640
 So what if to name just one major pollution source,

2:14:59.640 --> 2:15:03.800
 we didn't have the pollution caused by automobiles, right?

2:15:03.800 --> 2:15:06.080
 And if you had said to me, Dan,

2:15:06.080 --> 2:15:08.040
 what do you think the odds of us transitioning away

2:15:08.040 --> 2:15:09.480
 from that were 10 years ago,

2:15:09.480 --> 2:15:10.840
 I would have said, well, people aren't gonna do it

2:15:10.840 --> 2:15:12.280
 because it's inefficient, it's this, it's that,

2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:15.200
 nobody wants to, but what if you created a vehicle

2:15:15.200 --> 2:15:16.400
 that was superior in every way

2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:19.360
 so that if you were just a self oriented consumer,

2:15:19.360 --> 2:15:21.720
 you'd buy it because you wanted that car.

2:15:21.720 --> 2:15:24.280
 That's the best way to get around that problem

2:15:24.280 --> 2:15:28.480
 of people not wanting to, I think he's identified that.

2:15:28.480 --> 2:15:30.720
 And as he's told me before,

2:15:30.720 --> 2:15:33.200
 when the last time a car company was created

2:15:33.200 --> 2:15:36.520
 that actually, blah, blah, blah, he's right.

2:15:36.520 --> 2:15:39.280
 And so I happen to feel that even though he's pushing

2:15:39.280 --> 2:15:40.760
 the envelope on the space thing,

2:15:40.760 --> 2:15:43.640
 I think somebody else would have done that someday.

2:15:43.640 --> 2:15:46.640
 I'm not sure because of the various things he's mentioned,

2:15:46.640 --> 2:15:48.200
 how difficult it is to start there,

2:15:48.200 --> 2:15:51.120
 I'm not sure that the industries that create vehicles

2:15:51.120 --> 2:15:55.160
 for us would have gone where he's going to lead them

2:15:55.160 --> 2:15:57.960
 if he didn't force them there through consumer demand

2:15:57.960 --> 2:16:00.560
 by making a better car that people wanted anyway.

2:16:00.560 --> 2:16:03.840
 They'll follow, they'll copy, they'll do all those things.

2:16:03.840 --> 2:16:06.640
 And yet who was gonna do that?

2:16:06.640 --> 2:16:08.760
 So I hope he doesn't hate me for saying this,

2:16:08.760 --> 2:16:10.860
 but I happen to think the Tesla idea

2:16:12.240 --> 2:16:15.080
 may alleviate some of the need to get off this planet

2:16:15.080 --> 2:16:17.040
 because the planet's being destroyed, right?

2:16:17.040 --> 2:16:19.260
 And we're gonna colonize Mars probably anyway

2:16:19.260 --> 2:16:20.600
 if we live long enough.

2:16:20.600 --> 2:16:23.820
 And I think the Tesla idea, not just Elon's version,

2:16:23.820 --> 2:16:25.800
 but ones that follow from other people

2:16:25.800 --> 2:16:28.400
 is the best chance of making sure we're around long enough

2:16:28.400 --> 2:16:29.520
 to see Mars colonized.

2:16:29.520 --> 2:16:30.360
 Does that make sense?

2:16:30.360 --> 2:16:31.200
 Yeah, totally.

2:16:31.200 --> 2:16:33.240
 And one other thing from my perspective,

2:16:33.240 --> 2:16:35.320
 because I'm now starting a company,

2:16:35.320 --> 2:16:38.760
 I think the interesting thing about Elon

2:16:38.760 --> 2:16:43.640
 is he serves as a beacon of hope, like pragmatically speaking

2:16:43.640 --> 2:16:45.640
 for people that, sort of to push back

2:16:45.640 --> 2:16:48.580
 on our Doom conversation from earlier,

2:16:48.580 --> 2:16:53.580
 that a single individual could build something

2:16:53.580 --> 2:16:57.940
 that allows us as self interested individuals

2:16:57.940 --> 2:17:00.220
 to gather together in a collective way

2:17:00.220 --> 2:17:02.660
 to actually alleviate some of the dangers

2:17:02.660 --> 2:17:04.820
 that face our world.

2:17:04.820 --> 2:17:08.540
 So it gives me hope as an individual

2:17:08.540 --> 2:17:13.540
 that I can build something that can actually have impact

2:17:13.780 --> 2:17:18.780
 that counteracts the Stalins and the Hitlers

2:17:18.780 --> 2:17:23.780
 and all the threats that face that human civilization faces,

2:17:24.100 --> 2:17:26.020
 that an individual has that power.

2:17:26.020 --> 2:17:29.220
 I didn't believe that the individual has that power

2:17:29.220 --> 2:17:32.060
 in the halls of government.

2:17:32.060 --> 2:17:34.980
 Like, I don't feel like any one presidential candidate

2:17:34.980 --> 2:17:38.460
 can rise up and help the world, unite the world.

2:17:38.460 --> 2:17:41.500
 It feels like from everything I've seen

2:17:41.500 --> 2:17:44.020
 and you're right with Tesla,

2:17:44.020 --> 2:17:49.020
 it can bring the world together to do good.

2:17:49.300 --> 2:17:50.820
 That's a really powerful mechanism

2:17:50.820 --> 2:17:53.140
 of whatever you say about capitalism,

2:17:53.140 --> 2:17:58.100
 that you can build companies that start,

2:17:58.100 --> 2:17:59.340
 it starts with a single individual.

2:17:59.340 --> 2:18:02.640
 Of course, there's a collective that grows around that,

2:18:02.640 --> 2:18:05.020
 but the leadership of a single individual,

2:18:05.020 --> 2:18:08.100
 their ideas, their dreams, their vision

2:18:08.100 --> 2:18:12.560
 can catalyze something that takes over the world

2:18:12.560 --> 2:18:14.580
 and does good for the entire world.

2:18:14.580 --> 2:18:18.220
 But if I think, but again, I think the genius of the idea

2:18:18.220 --> 2:18:20.180
 is that it doesn't require us

2:18:20.180 --> 2:18:23.140
 to go head to head with human nature, right?

2:18:23.140 --> 2:18:27.580
 He's actually built human nature into the idea

2:18:27.580 --> 2:18:29.420
 by basically saying, I'm not asking you

2:18:29.420 --> 2:18:31.700
 to be an environmental activist.

2:18:31.700 --> 2:18:33.940
 I'm not asking you to sacrifice to make it.

2:18:33.940 --> 2:18:36.540
 I'm gonna sell you a car you're going to like better.

2:18:36.540 --> 2:18:38.740
 And by buying it, you'll help the environment.

2:18:38.740 --> 2:18:42.420
 That takes into account our foibles as a species

2:18:42.420 --> 2:18:46.460
 and actually leverages that to work for the greater good.

2:18:46.460 --> 2:18:49.300
 And that's the sort of thing that does turn off

2:18:49.300 --> 2:18:51.940
 my little doom caster cynicism thing a little bit

2:18:51.940 --> 2:18:55.020
 because you're actually hitting us where we live, right?

2:18:55.020 --> 2:18:57.280
 You're not, you can take somebody

2:18:57.280 --> 2:18:59.500
 who doesn't even believe the environment's a problem,

2:18:59.500 --> 2:19:00.500
 but they want a Tesla.

2:19:00.500 --> 2:19:03.140
 So they're inadvertently helping anyway.

2:19:03.140 --> 2:19:05.820
 I think that's the genius of the idea.

2:19:05.820 --> 2:19:09.540
 Yeah, and I'm telling you, that's one way to make love

2:19:09.540 --> 2:19:13.580
 a much more efficient mechanism of change than hate.

2:19:13.580 --> 2:19:15.140
 Making it in your self interest to love somebody.

2:19:15.140 --> 2:19:17.620
 Making it in your self interest, creating a product

2:19:17.620 --> 2:19:21.140
 that leads to more love than hate.

2:19:21.140 --> 2:19:22.380
 You're gonna wanna love your neighbor

2:19:22.380 --> 2:19:23.500
 because you're gonna make a fortune.

2:19:23.500 --> 2:19:24.340
 Exactly.

2:19:24.340 --> 2:19:25.160
 Right, okay, I get it.

2:19:25.160 --> 2:19:26.000
 There you go.

2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:26.820
 That's why he said.

2:19:26.820 --> 2:19:27.660
 All right, I'm on board.

2:19:27.660 --> 2:19:29.820
 That's why Elon said love is the answer.

2:19:29.820 --> 2:19:33.100
 That's, I think, exactly what he meant.

2:19:33.100 --> 2:19:35.680
 Okay, let's try something difficult.

2:19:35.680 --> 2:19:40.680
 You've recorded an episode of Steering Into the Iceberg

2:19:41.960 --> 2:19:43.640
 on your Common Sense program.

2:19:43.640 --> 2:19:44.620
 Yeah.

2:19:44.620 --> 2:19:47.120
 That has started a lot of conversations.

2:19:48.400 --> 2:19:51.120
 It's quite moving, it was quite haunting.

2:19:51.120 --> 2:19:52.960
 Got me a lot of angry emails.

2:19:52.960 --> 2:19:53.800
 Really?

2:19:53.800 --> 2:19:55.280
 Of course.

2:19:55.280 --> 2:19:57.320
 I did something I haven't done in 30 years.

2:19:57.320 --> 2:19:58.720
 I endorsed a political candidate

2:19:58.720 --> 2:19:59.840
 from one of the two main parties

2:19:59.840 --> 2:20:01.680
 and there were a lot of disillusioned people

2:20:01.680 --> 2:20:02.920
 because of that.

2:20:02.920 --> 2:20:05.520
 I guess I didn't hear it as an endorsement.

2:20:05.520 --> 2:20:10.520
 I just heard it as the similar flavor of conversation

2:20:11.840 --> 2:20:14.640
 as you have in hardcore history.

2:20:14.640 --> 2:20:19.480
 It's almost the speaking about modern times

2:20:19.480 --> 2:20:21.480
 in the same voice as you speak about

2:20:21.480 --> 2:20:23.000
 when you talk about history.

2:20:23.000 --> 2:20:27.160
 So it was just a little bit of a haunting view

2:20:27.160 --> 2:20:28.380
 of the world today.

2:20:30.560 --> 2:20:33.800
 I know we were just wearing our doom caster.

2:20:33.800 --> 2:20:36.000
 Let me put that right back on, are you?

2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:36.840
 No.

2:20:38.280 --> 2:20:40.240
 I like the term doom caster.

2:20:44.480 --> 2:20:46.440
 How do we get love to win?

2:20:47.360 --> 2:20:49.160
 What's the way out of this?

2:20:49.160 --> 2:20:54.160
 Is there some hopeful line that we can walk

2:20:57.560 --> 2:21:01.440
 to avoid something, and I hate to use the terminology,

2:21:01.440 --> 2:21:05.260
 but something that looks like a civil war,

2:21:06.200 --> 2:21:08.620
 not necessarily a war of force,

2:21:08.620 --> 2:21:13.620
 but a division to a level where it doesn't any longer feel

2:21:15.280 --> 2:21:20.000
 like a United States of America with an emphasis on United.

2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:21.960
 Is there a way out?

2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:24.920
 I read a book a while back.

2:21:24.920 --> 2:21:28.280
 I want to say George Friedman, the Stratfor guy wrote it.

2:21:28.280 --> 2:21:30.080
 It was something called The Next Hundred Years,

2:21:30.080 --> 2:21:31.520
 I think it was called.

2:21:31.520 --> 2:21:35.380
 And I remember thinking, I didn't agree with any of it.

2:21:35.380 --> 2:21:37.200
 And one of the things I think he said in the book

2:21:37.200 --> 2:21:39.260
 was that the United States was going to break up.

2:21:39.260 --> 2:21:40.100
 I'm going from memory here.

2:21:40.100 --> 2:21:41.080
 He might not have said that at all,

2:21:41.080 --> 2:21:42.600
 but something was stuck in my memory about that.

2:21:42.600 --> 2:21:43.760
 And I remember thinking,

2:21:45.980 --> 2:21:49.160
 but I think some of the arguments were connected

2:21:49.160 --> 2:21:53.020
 to the differences that we had

2:21:53.020 --> 2:21:55.760
 and the fact that those differences are being exploited.

2:21:55.760 --> 2:21:57.440
 So we talked about media earlier

2:21:57.440 --> 2:21:58.920
 and the lack of truth and everything.

2:21:58.920 --> 2:22:03.320
 We have a media climate that is incentivized

2:22:03.320 --> 2:22:08.160
 to take the wedges in our society and make them wider.

2:22:08.160 --> 2:22:11.920
 And there's no countervailing force to do the opposite

2:22:11.920 --> 2:22:13.340
 or to help.

2:22:13.340 --> 2:22:17.600
 So there was a famous memo

2:22:17.600 --> 2:22:21.000
 from a group called Project for a New American Century.

2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:21.880
 And they took it down,

2:22:21.880 --> 2:22:24.040
 but the Wayback Machine online still has it.

2:22:24.040 --> 2:22:25.800
 And it happened before 9 11,

2:22:25.800 --> 2:22:27.640
 spawned all kinds of conspiracy theories

2:22:27.640 --> 2:22:30.840
 because it was saying something to the effect of,

2:22:30.840 --> 2:22:32.320
 and I'm really paraphrasing here,

2:22:32.320 --> 2:22:33.800
 but you know that the United States

2:22:33.800 --> 2:22:36.320
 needs another Pearl Harbor type event

2:22:36.320 --> 2:22:39.160
 because those galvanize a country

2:22:39.160 --> 2:22:41.720
 that without those kinds of events periodically

2:22:41.720 --> 2:22:45.400
 is naturally geared towards pulling itself apart.

2:22:45.400 --> 2:22:47.160
 And it's those periodic events

2:22:47.160 --> 2:22:49.040
 that act as the countervailing force

2:22:49.040 --> 2:22:50.500
 that otherwise is not there.

2:22:52.120 --> 2:22:53.720
 If that's true,

2:22:53.720 --> 2:22:57.920
 then we are naturally inclined towards pulling ourselves apart.

2:22:57.920 --> 2:23:01.420
 So to have a media environment

2:23:01.420 --> 2:23:06.360
 that makes money off widening those divisions,

2:23:06.360 --> 2:23:07.200
 which we do.

2:23:07.200 --> 2:23:08.680
 I mean, I was in talk radio

2:23:08.680 --> 2:23:11.120
 and it has those people,

2:23:11.120 --> 2:23:12.640
 the people that used to scream at me

2:23:12.640 --> 2:23:13.600
 cause I wouldn't do it.

2:23:13.600 --> 2:23:15.620
 But I mean, we would have these terrible conversations

2:23:15.620 --> 2:23:17.020
 after every broadcast

2:23:17.020 --> 2:23:18.600
 where I'd be in there with the program director

2:23:18.600 --> 2:23:21.280
 and they're yelling at me about heat.

2:23:21.280 --> 2:23:22.980
 Heat was the word they create more heat.

2:23:22.980 --> 2:23:24.380
 Well, what is heat, right?

2:23:24.380 --> 2:23:25.800
 Heat is division, right?

2:23:25.800 --> 2:23:26.640
 And they want the heat,

2:23:26.640 --> 2:23:28.320
 not because they're political,

2:23:28.320 --> 2:23:32.480
 they're not Republicans or Democrats either.

2:23:32.480 --> 2:23:33.920
 We want listeners

2:23:33.920 --> 2:23:36.000
 and we want engagement and involvement.

2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:39.040
 And because of the constructs of the format,

2:23:39.040 --> 2:23:40.320
 you don't have a lot of time to get it.

2:23:40.320 --> 2:23:43.120
 So you can't have me giving you like on a podcast

2:23:43.120 --> 2:23:44.940
 an hour and a half or two hours

2:23:44.940 --> 2:23:47.000
 where we build a logical argument

2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:48.680
 and you're with me the whole way,

2:23:48.680 --> 2:23:51.240
 your audience is changing every 15 minutes.

2:23:51.240 --> 2:23:53.680
 So whatever points you make to create interest

2:23:53.680 --> 2:23:58.400
 and intrigue and engagement have to be knee jerk right now.

2:23:58.400 --> 2:24:00.280
 Things, they told me once

2:24:00.280 --> 2:24:01.720
 that the audience has to know

2:24:01.720 --> 2:24:04.960
 where you stand on every single issue

2:24:04.960 --> 2:24:07.640
 within five minutes of turning on your show.

2:24:07.640 --> 2:24:09.200
 In other words, you have to be part

2:24:09.200 --> 2:24:12.720
 of a linear set of political beliefs

2:24:12.720 --> 2:24:15.940
 so that if you feel A about subject A,

2:24:15.940 --> 2:24:18.040
 then you must feel D about subject D.

2:24:18.040 --> 2:24:19.560
 And I don't even need to hear your opinion on it

2:24:19.560 --> 2:24:20.640
 cause if you feel that way about A,

2:24:20.640 --> 2:24:22.320
 you're gonna feel that way about D.

2:24:22.320 --> 2:24:24.320
 This is a system that is designed

2:24:24.320 --> 2:24:26.600
 to pull us apart for profit,

2:24:26.600 --> 2:24:29.360
 but not because they wanna pull us apart, right?

2:24:29.360 --> 2:24:31.480
 It's a byproduct of the profit.

2:24:32.540 --> 2:24:37.540
 That's one little example of 50 examples in our society

2:24:37.740 --> 2:24:39.880
 that work in that same fashion.

2:24:39.880 --> 2:24:40.840
 So what that project

2:24:40.840 --> 2:24:42.940
 for a new American century document was saying

2:24:42.940 --> 2:24:46.520
 is that we're naturally inclined towards disunity

2:24:46.520 --> 2:24:49.720
 and without things to occasionally ratchet

2:24:49.720 --> 2:24:51.220
 the unity back up again,

2:24:51.220 --> 2:24:53.200
 so that we can start from the baseline again

2:24:53.200 --> 2:24:55.960
 and then pull ourselves apart till the next Pearl Harbor,

2:24:55.960 --> 2:24:57.240
 that you'll pull yourself apart,

2:24:57.240 --> 2:24:58.680
 which I think was,

2:24:58.680 --> 2:25:01.160
 think that's what the George Friedman book was saying

2:25:01.160 --> 2:25:03.260
 that I disagreed with so much at the time.

2:25:04.380 --> 2:25:07.960
 So in answer to your question about civil wars,

2:25:07.960 --> 2:25:09.740
 we can't have the same kind of civil war

2:25:09.740 --> 2:25:12.000
 because we don't have a geographical division

2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:13.960
 that's as clear cut as the one we had before, right?

2:25:13.960 --> 2:25:16.720
 You had a basically north south line and some border states.

2:25:16.720 --> 2:25:18.880
 It was set up for that kind of a split.

2:25:18.880 --> 2:25:22.420
 Now we're divided within communities, within families,

2:25:22.420 --> 2:25:25.980
 within gerrymandered voting districts and precincts, right?

2:25:25.980 --> 2:25:28.580
 So you can't disengage.

2:25:28.580 --> 2:25:30.000
 We're stuck with each other.

2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:31.800
 So if there's a civil war now,

2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:34.760
 for lack of a better word,

2:25:34.760 --> 2:25:39.560
 what it might seem like is the late 1960s, early 1970s,

2:25:39.560 --> 2:25:42.000
 where you had the bombings

2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:45.800
 and let's call it domestic terrorism and things like that,

2:25:45.800 --> 2:25:48.500
 because that would seem to be something

2:25:48.500 --> 2:25:50.840
 that once again, you don't even need a large chunk

2:25:50.840 --> 2:25:52.200
 of the country pulling apart.

2:25:52.200 --> 2:25:56.040
 10% of people who think it's the end times

2:25:56.040 --> 2:25:57.000
 can do the damage.

2:25:57.000 --> 2:25:59.200
 Just like we talked about terrorism before

2:25:59.200 --> 2:26:01.360
 and a can of gas and a big lighter,

2:26:01.360 --> 2:26:02.920
 I've lived in a bunch of places

2:26:02.920 --> 2:26:04.640
 and I won't give anybody ideas

2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:06.640
 where a can of gas and a big lighter

2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:10.280
 would take a thousand houses down before you could blink.

2:26:10.280 --> 2:26:11.120
 Right?

2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:15.620
 That terrorist doesn't have to be from the Middle East,

2:26:15.620 --> 2:26:17.640
 doesn't have to have some sort of a fundamentalist

2:26:17.640 --> 2:26:18.800
 or religious agenda.

2:26:18.800 --> 2:26:20.780
 It could just be somebody really pissed off

2:26:20.780 --> 2:26:22.280
 about the election results.

2:26:22.280 --> 2:26:25.440
 So once again, if we're playing an odds game here,

2:26:25.440 --> 2:26:28.480
 everybody has to behave for this to work right.

2:26:28.480 --> 2:26:30.400
 Only a few people have to misbehave

2:26:30.400 --> 2:26:31.640
 for this thing to go sideways.

2:26:31.640 --> 2:26:33.760
 And remember, for every action,

2:26:33.760 --> 2:26:36.280
 there is an equal and opposite reaction.

2:26:36.280 --> 2:26:38.240
 So you don't even have to have those people

2:26:38.240 --> 2:26:39.120
 doing all these things.

2:26:39.120 --> 2:26:43.240
 All they have to do is start a tit for tat retribution cycle.

2:26:43.240 --> 2:26:44.280
 And there's an escalation.

2:26:44.280 --> 2:26:45.120
 Yes.

2:26:45.120 --> 2:26:48.800
 And it creates a momentum of its own,

2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:49.960
 which leads fundamentally,

2:26:49.960 --> 2:26:51.800
 if you follow the chain of events down there

2:26:51.800 --> 2:26:54.160
 to some form of dictatorial government

2:26:54.160 --> 2:26:57.400
 as the only way to create stability, right?

2:26:57.400 --> 2:26:59.480
 You want to destroy the Republic and have a dictator,

2:26:59.480 --> 2:27:00.320
 that's how you do.

2:27:00.320 --> 2:27:02.420
 And there are parallels to Nazi Germany,

2:27:02.420 --> 2:27:05.760
 the burning of the Reichstag, blah, blah, blah.

2:27:05.760 --> 2:27:07.840
 I'm the doom caster again, aren't I?

2:27:07.840 --> 2:27:09.880
 And some of it could be manufactured

2:27:09.880 --> 2:27:12.000
 by those seeking authoritarian power.

2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:14.840
 Absolutely, like the Reichstag fire was

2:27:14.840 --> 2:27:17.840
 or the Polish soldiers that fired over the border

2:27:17.840 --> 2:27:20.600
 before the invasion in 1939.

2:27:20.600 --> 2:27:24.560
 To fight the devil's advocate with an angel's advocate,

2:27:24.560 --> 2:27:27.760
 I would say just as our conversation about Elon,

2:27:27.760 --> 2:27:31.120
 it feels like individuals have power to unite us,

2:27:31.120 --> 2:27:33.440
 to be that force of unity.

2:27:33.440 --> 2:27:35.960
 So you mentioned the media.

2:27:35.960 --> 2:27:40.860
 I think you're one of the great podcasters in history.

2:27:40.860 --> 2:27:44.040
 Joe Rogan is like a long form, whatever.

2:27:44.040 --> 2:27:47.800
 It's not podcasting, it's actually whatever the, yeah.

2:27:47.800 --> 2:27:50.940
 Very infrequent is what it is, no matter what it is.

2:27:50.940 --> 2:27:53.600
 But the basic process of it is you go deep

2:27:53.600 --> 2:27:56.320
 and you stay deep and the listener stays

2:27:56.320 --> 2:27:57.680
 with you for a long time.

2:27:57.680 --> 2:28:01.000
 So I'm just looking at the numbers,

2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:05.340
 like we're almost three hours in.

2:28:05.340 --> 2:28:08.800
 And from previous episodes, I can tell you

2:28:08.800 --> 2:28:12.480
 that about 300,000 people are still listening

2:28:12.480 --> 2:28:15.160
 to the sound of our voice three hours in.

2:28:15.160 --> 2:28:18.540
 So usually it's 300 to 500,000 people listen

2:28:18.540 --> 2:28:19.380
 and they tune out.

2:28:19.380 --> 2:28:20.880
 Congratulations, by the way, that's wonderful.

2:28:20.880 --> 2:28:23.800
 Joe Rogan is like 10 times that.

2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:28.800
 And so he has power to unite.

2:28:30.080 --> 2:28:31.640
 You have power to unite.

2:28:31.640 --> 2:28:34.160
 There's a few people with voices

2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:36.380
 that it feels like they have power to unite.

2:28:37.360 --> 2:28:41.040
 Even if you quote unquote endorse a candidate and so on,

2:28:41.040 --> 2:28:46.040
 there's still, it feels to me that speaking of,

2:28:47.720 --> 2:28:49.420
 I don't wanna keep saying love,

2:28:49.420 --> 2:28:53.760
 but it's love and maybe unity more practically speaking

2:28:53.760 --> 2:28:58.760
 that like sanity, that like respect

2:28:58.940 --> 2:29:02.400
 for those you don't agree with or don't understand.

2:29:04.060 --> 2:29:09.060
 So empathy, just a few voices of those can help us avoid

2:29:09.060 --> 2:29:14.060
 the really importantly, not avoid the singular events,

2:29:14.120 --> 2:29:17.320
 like you said, of somebody starting a fire and so on,

2:29:17.320 --> 2:29:21.160
 but avoid the escalation of it.

2:29:21.160 --> 2:29:26.160
 The preparedness of the populace to escalate those events,

2:29:26.320 --> 2:29:31.320
 to turn a singular event and a single riot or a shooting

2:29:32.760 --> 2:29:35.700
 or like even something much more dramatic than that,

2:29:35.700 --> 2:29:38.580
 to turn that into something that creates

2:29:38.580 --> 2:29:43.200
 like ripples that grow as opposed to ripples that fade away.

2:29:43.200 --> 2:29:46.360
 And so like, I would like to put responsibility

2:29:46.360 --> 2:29:51.040
 on somebody like you and on me in some small way.

2:29:51.040 --> 2:29:55.720
 And Joe, being cognizant of the fact

2:29:55.720 --> 2:29:58.520
 that a lot of very destructive things

2:29:58.520 --> 2:29:59.880
 might happen in November.

2:30:01.200 --> 2:30:05.440
 And a few voices can save us is the feeling I have.

2:30:05.440 --> 2:30:07.560
 Not by saying who you should vote for

2:30:07.560 --> 2:30:09.200
 or any of that kind of stuff,

2:30:09.200 --> 2:30:13.680
 but really by being the voice of calm

2:30:13.680 --> 2:30:18.680
 that like calms the seas from

2:30:19.240 --> 2:30:22.240
 or whatever the analogy is from boiling up.

2:30:22.240 --> 2:30:24.720
 Because I truly am worried about,

2:30:25.960 --> 2:30:28.740
 this is the first time this year when I,

2:30:30.320 --> 2:30:32.960
 I sometimes, I somehow have felt

2:30:32.960 --> 2:30:35.960
 that the American project will go on forever.

2:30:35.960 --> 2:30:39.540
 When I came to this country, I just believed,

2:30:39.540 --> 2:30:42.340
 and I still think I'm young, but like,

2:30:42.340 --> 2:30:45.040
 I have a dream of creating a company

2:30:45.040 --> 2:30:47.400
 that will do a lot of good for the world.

2:30:47.400 --> 2:30:51.280
 And I thought that America is the beacon of hope

2:30:51.280 --> 2:30:54.280
 for the world and the ideas of freedom,

2:30:54.280 --> 2:30:56.760
 but also the idea of empowering companies

2:30:56.760 --> 2:30:58.800
 that can do some good for the world.

2:30:58.800 --> 2:31:03.580
 And I'm just worried about this America that filled me,

2:31:03.580 --> 2:31:08.160
 a kid that came from, our family came from nothing

2:31:08.160 --> 2:31:11.840
 and from Russia as it was, Soviet Union as it was,

2:31:11.840 --> 2:31:15.360
 to be able to do anything in this new country.

2:31:15.360 --> 2:31:16.560
 I'm just worried about it.

2:31:16.560 --> 2:31:18.720
 And it feels like a few people

2:31:18.720 --> 2:31:21.060
 can still keep this project going.

2:31:21.960 --> 2:31:25.860
 Like people like Elon, people like Joe.

2:31:25.860 --> 2:31:30.860
 Is there, do you have a bit of that hope?

2:31:34.140 --> 2:31:38.020
 I'm watching this experiment with social media right now.

2:31:38.020 --> 2:31:38.900
 And I don't even mean social media,

2:31:38.900 --> 2:31:41.220
 really expand that out to,

2:31:41.220 --> 2:31:43.420
 I mean, I feel like we're all guinea pigs right now,

2:31:43.420 --> 2:31:45.900
 watching, you know, I have two kids and just watching,

2:31:45.900 --> 2:31:48.500
 and there's a three year space between the two of them,

2:31:48.500 --> 2:31:50.620
 one's 18, the other's 15.

2:31:50.620 --> 2:31:52.920
 And just, you know, when I was a kid,

2:31:52.920 --> 2:31:56.520
 a person who was 18 and 15 would not be that different,

2:31:56.520 --> 2:31:58.660
 just three years difference, more maturity.

2:31:58.660 --> 2:32:00.120
 But their life experiences,

2:32:00.120 --> 2:32:02.240
 you would easily classify those two people

2:32:02.240 --> 2:32:04.760
 as being in the same generation.

2:32:04.760 --> 2:32:08.280
 Now, because of the speed of technological change,

2:32:08.280 --> 2:32:11.160
 there is a vast difference between my 18 year old

2:32:11.160 --> 2:32:13.500
 and my 15 year old, and not in a maturity question,

2:32:13.500 --> 2:32:17.220
 just in what apps they use, how they relate to each other,

2:32:17.220 --> 2:32:20.100
 how they deal with their peers, their social skills,

2:32:20.100 --> 2:32:22.460
 all those kinds of things where you turn around and go,

2:32:22.460 --> 2:32:25.180
 this is uncharted territory, we've never been here,

2:32:25.180 --> 2:32:26.200
 so it's gonna be interesting to see

2:32:26.200 --> 2:32:27.360
 what effect that has on society.

2:32:27.360 --> 2:32:29.900
 Now, as that relates to your question,

2:32:29.900 --> 2:32:33.580
 the most upsetting part about all that

2:32:33.580 --> 2:32:36.100
 is reading how people treat each other online.

2:32:36.100 --> 2:32:37.600
 And you know, there's lots of theories about this,

2:32:37.600 --> 2:32:40.200
 the fact that some of it is just for trolling laughs,

2:32:40.200 --> 2:32:42.380
 that some of it is just people are not interacting

2:32:42.380 --> 2:32:43.900
 face to face, so they feel free

2:32:43.900 --> 2:32:45.400
 to treat each other that way.

2:32:46.860 --> 2:32:51.460
 And I, of course, I'm trying to figure out how,

2:32:51.460 --> 2:32:55.180
 if this is how we have always been as people, right?

2:32:55.180 --> 2:32:57.180
 We've always been this way, but we've never had the means

2:32:57.180 --> 2:32:59.840
 to post our feelings publicly about it,

2:32:59.840 --> 2:33:02.700
 or if the environment and the social media

2:33:02.700 --> 2:33:05.840
 and everything else has provided a change

2:33:05.840 --> 2:33:08.100
 and changed us into something else.

2:33:09.300 --> 2:33:13.740
 Either way, when one reads how we treat one another

2:33:13.740 --> 2:33:17.660
 and the horrible things we say about one another online,

2:33:17.660 --> 2:33:20.180
 which seems like it shouldn't be that big of deal,

2:33:20.180 --> 2:33:23.080
 they're just words, but they have a cumulative effect.

2:33:23.080 --> 2:33:27.380
 I mean, when you, I was reading Meghan Markle,

2:33:27.380 --> 2:33:28.460
 who I don't know a lot about,

2:33:28.460 --> 2:33:30.500
 because it's too much of the pop side of culture

2:33:30.500 --> 2:33:32.420
 for me to pay lip, but I read a story the other day

2:33:32.420 --> 2:33:34.980
 where she was talking about the abuse she took online

2:33:34.980 --> 2:33:37.760
 and how incredibly overwhelming it was

2:33:37.760 --> 2:33:40.140
 and how many people were doing it.

2:33:40.140 --> 2:33:43.040
 And you think to yourself, okay, this is something

2:33:43.040 --> 2:33:44.840
 that people who are in positions

2:33:44.840 --> 2:33:46.620
 of what you were discussing earlier

2:33:46.620 --> 2:33:48.420
 never had to deal with.

2:33:48.420 --> 2:33:50.940
 Let me ask you something, and boy, this is the ultimate

2:33:50.940 --> 2:33:53.860
 doomcaster thing of all time to say.

2:33:53.860 --> 2:33:56.460
 When you think of historical figures

2:33:56.460 --> 2:34:01.300
 that push things like love and peace

2:34:01.300 --> 2:34:05.720
 and creating bridges between enemies,

2:34:05.720 --> 2:34:09.180
 when you think of what happened to those people,

2:34:09.180 --> 2:34:10.820
 first of all, they're very dangerous.

2:34:10.820 --> 2:34:13.020
 Every society in the world has a better time,

2:34:13.020 --> 2:34:15.540
 easier time dealing with violence and things like that

2:34:15.540 --> 2:34:16.940
 than they do nonviolence.

2:34:16.940 --> 2:34:19.380
 Nonviolence is really difficult for governments

2:34:19.380 --> 2:34:20.940
 to deal with, for example.

2:34:20.940 --> 2:34:25.260
 What happens to Gandhi and Jesus and Martin Luther King?

2:34:25.260 --> 2:34:27.660
 And you think about all those people, right?

2:34:27.660 --> 2:34:30.380
 When they're that, it's ironic, isn't it,

2:34:30.380 --> 2:34:32.660
 that these people who push for peaceful solutions

2:34:32.660 --> 2:34:36.920
 are so often killed, but it's because they're effective.

2:34:36.920 --> 2:34:40.220
 And when they're killed, the effectiveness is diminished.

2:34:40.220 --> 2:34:41.300
 Why are they killed?

2:34:41.300 --> 2:34:44.140
 Because they're effective, and the only way to stop them

2:34:44.140 --> 2:34:47.900
 is to eliminate them, because they're charismatic leaders

2:34:47.900 --> 2:34:49.580
 who don't come around every day,

2:34:49.580 --> 2:34:51.820
 and if you eliminate them from the scene,

2:34:51.820 --> 2:34:54.740
 the odds are you're not gonna get another one for a while.

2:34:54.740 --> 2:34:56.300
 I guess what I'm saying is the very things

2:34:56.300 --> 2:34:57.980
 you're talking about, which would have the effect

2:34:57.980 --> 2:34:58.880
 you think it would, right?

2:34:58.880 --> 2:35:01.580
 They would destabilize systems in a way

2:35:01.580 --> 2:35:03.840
 that most of us would consider positive,

2:35:03.840 --> 2:35:06.860
 but those systems have a way of protecting themselves,

2:35:06.860 --> 2:35:07.700
 right?

2:35:07.700 --> 2:35:10.940
 And so I feel like history shows,

2:35:10.940 --> 2:35:14.060
 see, history's pretty pessimistic, I think, by and large.

2:35:14.060 --> 2:35:16.380
 If only because we can find so many examples

2:35:16.380 --> 2:35:17.480
 that just sound pessimistic.

2:35:17.480 --> 2:35:19.740
 But I feel like people who are dangerous

2:35:19.740 --> 2:35:24.260
 to the way things are tend to be removed.

2:35:24.260 --> 2:35:26.820
 Yes, but there's two things to say.

2:35:26.820 --> 2:35:29.180
 I feel like you're right, that history,

2:35:30.340 --> 2:35:35.300
 I feel like the ripples that love leaves in history

2:35:35.300 --> 2:35:37.020
 are less obvious to detect,

2:35:37.020 --> 2:35:39.540
 but are actually more transformational.

2:35:39.540 --> 2:35:41.620
 Like in this. Well, one could make a case about,

2:35:41.620 --> 2:35:44.020
 I mean, if you wanna talk about the long term value

2:35:44.020 --> 2:35:45.980
 of a Jesus, a Gandhi, but yeah, yes,

2:35:45.980 --> 2:35:48.260
 those people's ripples are still affecting people today.

2:35:48.260 --> 2:35:49.100
 I agree with you.

2:35:49.100 --> 2:35:50.780
 And that's, you feel those ripples

2:35:50.780 --> 2:35:53.700
 through the general improvement of the quality of life

2:35:53.700 --> 2:35:56.540
 that we see throughout the generations.

2:35:56.540 --> 2:35:58.380
 Like you feel the ripples through the growth.

2:35:58.380 --> 2:35:59.900
 Yeah, okay, I'll go along with you on that, okay.

2:35:59.900 --> 2:36:02.380
 But I would, even if that's not true,

2:36:04.460 --> 2:36:07.740
 I tend to believe that, and by the way,

2:36:07.740 --> 2:36:12.140
 the company that I'm working on as a competitor

2:36:12.140 --> 2:36:15.700
 is exactly attacking this, which is a competitor to Twitter.

2:36:15.700 --> 2:36:17.820
 I think I can build a better Twitter as a first step.

2:36:17.820 --> 2:36:18.940
 There's a long story in there.

2:36:18.940 --> 2:36:21.500
 I think a three year old child could build a better,

2:36:21.500 --> 2:36:22.980
 and this is not to denigrate you,

2:36:22.980 --> 2:36:24.580
 I'm sure yours would be better than a three year old,

2:36:24.580 --> 2:36:27.180
 but Twitter is so, and listen, Facebook too,

2:36:27.180 --> 2:36:30.580
 they're really awful platforms for intellectual discussion

2:36:30.580 --> 2:36:33.020
 and meaningful discussion, and I'm on it.

2:36:33.020 --> 2:36:34.580
 So let me just say, I'm part of the problem.

2:36:34.580 --> 2:36:36.980
 We're new to this, so it wasn't obvious at the time

2:36:36.980 --> 2:36:41.020
 how to do it, it's now, and now a three year old can do it.

2:36:41.020 --> 2:36:46.020
 I tend to believe that we live in a time where the tools

2:36:46.140 --> 2:36:49.500
 that people that are interested in providing love,

2:36:49.500 --> 2:36:54.660
 like the weapons of love are much more powerful.

2:36:54.660 --> 2:36:58.340
 So like the one nice thing about technology

2:36:58.340 --> 2:37:02.020
 is it allows anyone to build a company

2:37:02.020 --> 2:37:04.580
 that's more powerful than any government.

2:37:04.580 --> 2:37:06.620
 So that could be very destructive,

2:37:06.620 --> 2:37:09.660
 but it could be also very positive.

2:37:09.660 --> 2:37:12.420
 And that's, I tend to believe that somebody like Elon

2:37:12.420 --> 2:37:14.100
 that wants to do good for the world,

2:37:14.100 --> 2:37:16.540
 somebody like me and many like me

2:37:16.540 --> 2:37:19.340
 could have more power than any one government.

2:37:20.860 --> 2:37:24.460
 And by power, I mean the power to effect change,

2:37:24.460 --> 2:37:25.300
 which is different from Gandhi.

2:37:25.300 --> 2:37:26.140
 What do you do with government,

2:37:26.140 --> 2:37:26.980
 and I don't mean to interrupt you,

2:37:26.980 --> 2:37:28.700
 but I'll forget my train of thought, I'm getting old.

2:37:28.700 --> 2:37:30.300
 But I mean, how do you deal with the fact

2:37:30.300 --> 2:37:33.660
 that already governments who are afraid of this

2:37:33.660 --> 2:37:36.220
 are walling off their own internet systems

2:37:36.220 --> 2:37:40.340
 as a way to create firewalls simply to prevent you

2:37:40.340 --> 2:37:42.260
 from doing what you're talking about?

2:37:42.260 --> 2:37:43.900
 In other words, there's an old line

2:37:43.900 --> 2:37:45.340
 that if voting really changed anything,

2:37:45.340 --> 2:37:46.980
 they'd never allow it.

2:37:46.980 --> 2:37:51.900
 If love through a modern day successor to Twitter

2:37:51.900 --> 2:37:53.780
 would really do what you want it to do,

2:37:53.780 --> 2:37:56.500
 and this would destabilize governments,

2:37:56.500 --> 2:38:00.540
 do you think that governments would take countermeasures

2:38:00.540 --> 2:38:03.620
 to squash that love before it got too dangerous?

2:38:03.620 --> 2:38:04.820
 There's several answers.

2:38:04.820 --> 2:38:06.900
 One, first of all, I don't actually,

2:38:06.900 --> 2:38:08.740
 to push back on something you said earlier,

2:38:08.740 --> 2:38:12.700
 I don't think love is as much of an enemy of the state

2:38:12.700 --> 2:38:14.940
 as one would think.

2:38:14.940 --> 2:38:16.860
 Different states have different views.

2:38:20.100 --> 2:38:22.540
 I think the states want power,

2:38:22.540 --> 2:38:27.460
 and I don't always think that love is in tension with power.

2:38:33.220 --> 2:38:34.620
 I think it's not just about love,

2:38:34.620 --> 2:38:37.940
 it's about rationality, it's reason, it's empathy,

2:38:37.940 --> 2:38:39.060
 all of those things.

2:38:39.060 --> 2:38:42.740
 I don't necessarily think there always have to be

2:38:42.740 --> 2:38:45.660
 by definition in conflict with each other.

2:38:45.660 --> 2:38:50.100
 So that's one sense is I feel like basically

2:38:50.100 --> 2:38:54.900
 you can Trojan horse love into behind,

2:38:54.900 --> 2:38:56.100
 but you have to be good at it.

2:38:56.100 --> 2:38:57.060
 This is the thing,

2:38:58.420 --> 2:39:01.500
 is you have to be conscious of the way these states think.

2:39:01.500 --> 2:39:05.700
 So the fact that China bans certain services and so on,

2:39:05.700 --> 2:39:09.340
 that means the companies weren't eloquent,

2:39:09.340 --> 2:39:10.900
 whoever the companies are,

2:39:10.900 --> 2:39:14.500
 weren't actually good at infiltrating.

2:39:16.900 --> 2:39:19.780
 I think, isn't that a song, like love is a battlefield?

2:39:19.780 --> 2:39:22.500
 I think it's all a cap editor.

2:39:22.500 --> 2:39:25.700
 It's all a game, and you have to be good at the game.

2:39:25.700 --> 2:39:28.780
 And just like Elon, we said with Tesla

2:39:28.780 --> 2:39:32.380
 and saving the environment.

2:39:32.380 --> 2:39:35.260
 I mean, that's not just by getting on a stage

2:39:35.260 --> 2:39:37.700
 and saying it's important to save the environment,

2:39:37.700 --> 2:39:42.700
 is by building a product that people can't help but love

2:39:43.540 --> 2:39:46.100
 and then convincing Hollywood stars to love it.

2:39:46.100 --> 2:39:48.740
 Like there's a game to be played.

2:39:48.740 --> 2:39:50.580
 Okay, so let me build on that

2:39:50.580 --> 2:39:52.420
 because I think there's a way to see this.

2:39:52.420 --> 2:39:53.260
 I think you're right.

2:39:53.260 --> 2:39:57.020
 And so it has to do with a story about the 1960s.

2:39:57.020 --> 2:39:59.580
 In the vast scheme of things, the 1960s looks like

2:39:59.580 --> 2:40:03.740
 a revival of neo romantic ideas, right?

2:40:03.740 --> 2:40:05.660
 I had a buddy of mine several years,

2:40:05.660 --> 2:40:09.020
 well, two decades older than I was who was in the 60s,

2:40:09.020 --> 2:40:11.380
 went to the protest, did all those kinds of things.

2:40:11.380 --> 2:40:14.020
 And we were talking about it and I was romanticizing it.

2:40:14.020 --> 2:40:15.300
 He said, don't romanticize it.

2:40:15.300 --> 2:40:16.780
 He goes, let me tell you, most of the people

2:40:16.780 --> 2:40:19.560
 that went to those protests and did all those things,

2:40:19.560 --> 2:40:21.960
 all they were there was to meet girls and have a good time.

2:40:21.960 --> 2:40:23.620
 And it wasn't so,

2:40:23.620 --> 2:40:28.620
 but it became in vogue to have all,

2:40:29.100 --> 2:40:32.100
 in other words, let's talk about your empathy and love.

2:40:32.100 --> 2:40:33.900
 You're never gonna, in my opinion,

2:40:33.900 --> 2:40:36.420
 grab that great mass of people that are only in it

2:40:36.420 --> 2:40:38.340
 for their interest in whatever.

2:40:38.340 --> 2:40:42.500
 But if meeting girls for a young teenage guy

2:40:42.500 --> 2:40:45.900
 requires you to feign empathy,

2:40:45.900 --> 2:40:49.300
 requires you to read deeper subjects

2:40:49.300 --> 2:40:52.020
 because that's what people are into,

2:40:52.020 --> 2:40:55.580
 you can almost, as a silly way to be trendy,

2:40:55.580 --> 2:40:59.460
 you could make maybe empathy trendy, love trendy,

2:40:59.460 --> 2:41:02.340
 solutions that are the opposite of that,

2:41:03.260 --> 2:41:05.660
 the kind of things that people inherently

2:41:05.660 --> 2:41:07.140
 will not put up with.

2:41:07.140 --> 2:41:09.540
 In other words, the possibility exists

2:41:09.540 --> 2:41:13.820
 to change the zeitgeist and reorient it in a way

2:41:13.820 --> 2:41:17.180
 that even if most of the people aren't serious about it,

2:41:17.180 --> 2:41:19.060
 the results are the same.

2:41:19.060 --> 2:41:19.880
 Does that make sense?

2:41:19.880 --> 2:41:21.080
 Absolutely. Okay.

2:41:21.080 --> 2:41:23.460
 Okay, so we've found a meeting of the moments.

2:41:23.460 --> 2:41:24.300
 Yeah, exactly.

2:41:24.300 --> 2:41:29.300
 Creating incentives that encourage the best

2:41:29.860 --> 2:41:32.060
 and the most beautiful aspects of human nature.

2:41:32.060 --> 2:41:33.780
 Even against our will.

2:41:33.780 --> 2:41:36.420
 It all boils down to meeting girls and boys.

2:41:37.660 --> 2:41:39.180
 Once again, you're getting to the bottom

2:41:39.180 --> 2:41:40.940
 of the evolutionary motivations

2:41:40.940 --> 2:41:42.940
 and you're always on safe ground when you do that.

2:41:42.940 --> 2:41:43.820
 Yeah.

2:41:43.820 --> 2:41:45.420
 That's a little difficult for me.

2:41:46.300 --> 2:41:48.260
 And I'm sure it's actually difficult for you

2:41:48.260 --> 2:41:51.180
 to listen to me say complimenting you,

2:41:51.180 --> 2:41:56.180
 but it's difficult for both of us, okay?

2:41:57.020 --> 2:42:01.140
 So, but you and I, as I mentioned to you,

2:42:01.140 --> 2:42:03.420
 I think off mic, been friends for a long time.

2:42:03.420 --> 2:42:05.060
 It's just been one way.

2:42:05.060 --> 2:42:06.740
 It's two way now.

2:42:06.740 --> 2:42:08.100
 It's two way now.

2:42:08.100 --> 2:42:10.820
 So that's the beauty of podcasting.

2:42:10.820 --> 2:42:12.860
 Now, just been fortunate enough

2:42:12.860 --> 2:42:14.260
 with this particular podcast

2:42:14.260 --> 2:42:17.320
 that I see it in people's eyes when they meet me,

2:42:17.320 --> 2:42:20.980
 that they've been friends with me for a few years now.

2:42:20.980 --> 2:42:25.100
 And we become fast friends actually after we start talking.

2:42:25.100 --> 2:42:28.560
 But it's one way in the vet in that first moment.

2:42:30.020 --> 2:42:32.220
 You know, like there's something about

2:42:32.220 --> 2:42:34.460
 the especially hardcore history that,

2:42:34.460 --> 2:42:37.900
 you know, I do some crazy challenges and running and stuff.

2:42:37.900 --> 2:42:40.780
 I remember in particular, probably don't have time.

2:42:40.780 --> 2:42:44.300
 One of my favorite episodes, the painful tainment one.

2:42:44.300 --> 2:42:46.140
 Some people hate that episode.

2:42:46.140 --> 2:42:47.420
 Because it's too real.

2:42:47.420 --> 2:42:49.100
 Yeah, they can't listen to it.

2:42:49.100 --> 2:42:50.120
 It's my darkest one.

2:42:50.120 --> 2:42:51.480
 We wanted to set a baseline.

2:42:51.480 --> 2:42:53.100
 That's the baseline.

2:42:53.100 --> 2:42:54.980
 But I remember listening to that

2:42:54.980 --> 2:42:58.340
 when I ran 22 miles for me, that was a long distance.

2:42:58.340 --> 2:43:00.780
 Holy cow, that's painful tainment right there.

2:43:00.780 --> 2:43:03.580
 Yeah, and it just pulls you in.

2:43:03.580 --> 2:43:06.620
 There's something so powerful

2:43:06.620 --> 2:43:09.080
 about this particular creation

2:43:09.080 --> 2:43:12.100
 that's bigger than you actually, that you've created.

2:43:12.100 --> 2:43:13.140
 It's kind of interesting.

2:43:13.140 --> 2:43:14.980
 I think anything that is successful like that,

2:43:14.980 --> 2:43:17.140
 like Elon's stuff too, it becomes bigger than you.

2:43:17.140 --> 2:43:18.900
 And that's what you're hoping for, right?

2:43:18.900 --> 2:43:19.740
 Absolutely.

2:43:19.740 --> 2:43:20.940
 Didn't mean to interrupt you, I apologize.

2:43:20.940 --> 2:43:25.940
 I guess a question I have, if you look in the mirror,

2:43:26.060 --> 2:43:27.460
 but you also look at me,

2:43:29.220 --> 2:43:34.220
 what advice would you give to yourself and to me

2:43:34.340 --> 2:43:37.500
 and to other podcasters, maybe to Joe Rogan,

2:43:37.500 --> 2:43:40.040
 about this journey that we're on?

2:43:40.040 --> 2:43:41.860
 I feel like it's something special.

2:43:41.860 --> 2:43:44.040
 I'm not sure exactly what's happening.

2:43:44.040 --> 2:43:46.300
 But it feels like podcasting is special.

2:43:48.300 --> 2:43:51.520
 What advice, and I'm relatively new to it,

2:43:52.540 --> 2:43:55.300
 what advice do you have for people

2:43:55.300 --> 2:43:58.500
 that are carrying this flame and traveling this journey?

2:43:59.580 --> 2:44:03.620
 Well, I'm often asked for advice by new podcasters,

2:44:03.620 --> 2:44:04.940
 people just starting out.

2:44:04.940 --> 2:44:08.900
 And so I have sort of a tried and true list

2:44:08.900 --> 2:44:11.340
 of do's and don'ts.

2:44:11.340 --> 2:44:16.340
 But I don't have advice or suggestions for you or for Joe.

2:44:18.140 --> 2:44:19.740
 Joe doesn't need anything from me.

2:44:19.740 --> 2:44:21.260
 Joe's figured it out, right?

2:44:21.260 --> 2:44:22.100
 I mean, he hasn't yet.

2:44:22.100 --> 2:44:25.260
 He's still a confused kid, curious about the world.

2:44:25.260 --> 2:44:26.780
 But that's the genius of it.

2:44:26.780 --> 2:44:28.580
 That's what makes it work, right?

2:44:28.580 --> 2:44:31.740
 That's what Joe's brand is, right?

2:44:31.740 --> 2:44:32.900
 I guess what I'm saying is,

2:44:32.900 --> 2:44:35.300
 by the time you reach the stage that you're at,

2:44:35.300 --> 2:44:38.040
 or Joe's at, they don't need it.

2:44:38.040 --> 2:44:39.480
 They have figured this out.

2:44:39.480 --> 2:44:41.760
 The people that sometimes need help are brand new people

2:44:41.760 --> 2:44:43.580
 trying to figure out what do I do with my first show

2:44:43.580 --> 2:44:44.860
 and how do I talk into them?

2:44:44.860 --> 2:44:47.020
 And I have standard answers for that.

2:44:47.020 --> 2:44:48.420
 But you found your niche.

2:44:48.420 --> 2:44:51.180
 I mean, you don't need me to tell you what to do.

2:44:51.180 --> 2:44:52.940
 As a matter of fact, I might ask you questions

2:44:52.940 --> 2:44:55.340
 about how you do what you do, right?

2:44:55.340 --> 2:44:58.580
 Well, I guess there's specific things

2:44:58.580 --> 2:45:01.660
 like we were talking offline about monetization.

2:45:01.660 --> 2:45:03.260
 That's a fascinating one.

2:45:03.260 --> 2:45:05.980
 Very difficult as an independent, yeah.

2:45:05.980 --> 2:45:09.060
 And one of the things that Joe is facing

2:45:09.060 --> 2:45:11.140
 with, I don't know if you're paying attention,

2:45:11.140 --> 2:45:15.940
 but he joined Spotify with a $100 million deal

2:45:15.940 --> 2:45:18.200
 for going exclusive on their platform.

2:45:18.200 --> 2:45:19.900
 The idea of exclusivity that,

2:45:19.900 --> 2:45:22.260
 one, I don't give a damn about money personally,

2:45:22.260 --> 2:45:26.080
 but I'm single, and I like living in a shitty place.

2:45:26.080 --> 2:45:30.540
 So I enjoy, so I guess it makes it easy.

2:45:30.540 --> 2:45:32.580
 You get the freedom, right, to not care, yeah.

2:45:32.580 --> 2:45:33.420
 Freedom.

2:45:33.420 --> 2:45:34.240
 It's freedom.

2:45:34.240 --> 2:45:35.840
 Not saving for anybody's college.

2:45:35.840 --> 2:45:37.040
 Exactly. Yeah.

2:45:37.040 --> 2:45:40.380
 Okay, so on that point, but I also,

2:45:40.380 --> 2:45:41.980
 okay, maybe it's romanticization,

2:45:41.980 --> 2:45:46.100
 but I feel like podcasting is pirate radio.

2:45:46.100 --> 2:45:50.820
 And when I first heard about Spotify partnering up with Joe,

2:45:50.820 --> 2:45:53.380
 I was like, you know, fuck the man.

2:45:53.380 --> 2:45:57.280
 I said, I even, I drafted a few tweets and so on,

2:45:57.280 --> 2:46:00.980
 just like attacking Spotify, then I calmed myself down

2:46:00.980 --> 2:46:04.660
 that you can't lock up this special thing we have.

2:46:04.660 --> 2:46:07.700
 But then I realized that maybe

2:46:07.700 --> 2:46:11.900
 that these are vehicles for just reaching more people

2:46:11.900 --> 2:46:15.120
 and actually respecting podcasters more and so on.

2:46:15.120 --> 2:46:18.700
 So that's what I mean by it's unclear what the journey is

2:46:18.700 --> 2:46:22.260
 because you also serve as beacon for,

2:46:22.260 --> 2:46:26.400
 now there's like millions, one million plus podcasters.

2:46:29.400 --> 2:46:31.540
 I wonder what the journey is.

2:46:31.540 --> 2:46:32.780
 Do you have a sense,

2:46:32.780 --> 2:46:36.860
 are you romantic in the same kind of way

2:46:36.860 --> 2:46:41.060
 in feeling that, because you have a roots in radio too.

2:46:41.060 --> 2:46:43.920
 Do you feel that podcasting is pirate radio

2:46:43.920 --> 2:46:48.020
 or is the Spotify thing one possible avenue?

2:46:48.020 --> 2:46:51.020
 Are you nervous about Joe as a fan, as a friend of Joe

2:46:52.260 --> 2:46:55.940
 or is this a good thing for us?

2:46:55.940 --> 2:46:58.380
 So my history of how I got involved

2:46:58.380 --> 2:47:00.260
 in podcasting is interesting.

2:47:00.260 --> 2:47:01.100
 Yes.

2:47:01.100 --> 2:47:04.660
 I was in radio and then I started a company

2:47:04.660 --> 2:47:08.100
 back in the era where the dot com boom was happening

2:47:08.100 --> 2:47:09.280
 and everybody was being bought up

2:47:09.280 --> 2:47:12.280
 and it just seemed like a great idea, right?

2:47:12.280 --> 2:47:14.780
 I did it with six other people

2:47:14.780 --> 2:47:18.020
 and the whole goal of the company was,

2:47:18.020 --> 2:47:19.220
 we had to invent the term.

2:47:19.220 --> 2:47:20.840
 I'm sure everybody, there's other places

2:47:20.840 --> 2:47:22.180
 that invented it at the same time.

2:47:22.180 --> 2:47:25.100
 But what we were pitching to investors

2:47:25.100 --> 2:47:26.920
 was something called amateur content.

2:47:26.920 --> 2:47:29.220
 So this is before YouTube, before podcasting,

2:47:29.220 --> 2:47:30.980
 before all this stuff.

2:47:30.980 --> 2:47:34.500
 And my job was to be the evangelist.

2:47:34.500 --> 2:47:36.580
 And I would go to these people and talk

2:47:36.580 --> 2:47:39.640
 and sing the praises of all the ways

2:47:39.640 --> 2:47:42.260
 that amateur content was gonna be great.

2:47:42.260 --> 2:47:45.340
 And I never got a bite.

2:47:45.340 --> 2:47:46.860
 And they all told me the same thing.

2:47:46.860 --> 2:47:47.940
 This isn't gonna take off

2:47:47.940 --> 2:47:50.360
 cause anybody who's good is already gonna be making money

2:47:50.360 --> 2:47:51.200
 at this.

2:47:51.200 --> 2:47:53.100
 And I kept saying, forget that.

2:47:53.100 --> 2:47:55.260
 We're talking about scale here.

2:47:55.260 --> 2:47:57.560
 If you have millions of pieces of content

2:47:57.560 --> 2:48:00.080
 being made every week, a small percentage

2:48:00.080 --> 2:48:01.540
 is gonna be good no matter what, right?

2:48:01.540 --> 2:48:03.980
 16 year olds will know what other 16 year olds like.

2:48:03.980 --> 2:48:06.100
 I kept pushing this nobody bit.

2:48:06.100 --> 2:48:07.540
 But the podcast grew out of that

2:48:07.540 --> 2:48:12.540
 because if you're talking about amateur content in 1999,

2:48:12.900 --> 2:48:16.920
 well then you're already, you're ahead of the game

2:48:16.920 --> 2:48:20.380
 in terms of not seeing where it's gonna go financially

2:48:20.380 --> 2:48:23.140
 but seeing where it's going to go technologically.

2:48:23.140 --> 2:48:25.500
 And so when we started the podcast in 2005

2:48:25.500 --> 2:48:28.020
 and it was the political one, not hardcore history,

2:48:28.020 --> 2:48:30.940
 which was an outgrowth of the old radio show,

2:48:30.940 --> 2:48:34.540
 we didn't have any financial ideas.

2:48:34.540 --> 2:48:37.460
 We were simply trying to get our handle on the technology

2:48:37.460 --> 2:48:38.980
 and how you distribute it to people and all that.

2:48:38.980 --> 2:48:41.940
 And it was years later that we tried to figure out,

2:48:41.940 --> 2:48:43.060
 okay, how can we get enough money

2:48:43.060 --> 2:48:45.060
 to just support us while we're doing this?

2:48:45.060 --> 2:48:46.620
 And the cheap and the easy way

2:48:46.620 --> 2:48:49.620
 was just to ask listeners to donate like a PBS kind of model.

2:48:49.620 --> 2:48:51.520
 And that was the original model.

2:48:52.940 --> 2:48:55.180
 So then once we started down that,

2:48:55.180 --> 2:48:57.500
 we figured out other models and there's the advertising thing

2:48:57.500 --> 2:48:58.740
 and that we sell the old shows.

2:48:58.740 --> 2:49:01.800
 And so all these became ways for us to support ourselves.

2:49:03.220 --> 2:49:06.920
 But as podcasting matured

2:49:06.920 --> 2:49:09.820
 and as more operating systems developed

2:49:09.820 --> 2:49:13.500
 and phones were developed and all these kinds of things,

2:49:13.500 --> 2:49:15.300
 every one of those developments,

2:49:15.300 --> 2:49:18.580
 which actually made it easier for people to get the podcast

2:49:18.580 --> 2:49:22.060
 actually made it more complex to make money off of them.

2:49:22.060 --> 2:49:24.140
 So while our audience was building,

2:49:24.140 --> 2:49:26.020
 the amount of time and effort we had to put

2:49:26.020 --> 2:49:29.940
 into the monetization side began to skyrocket.

2:49:29.940 --> 2:49:31.820
 So to get back to your Spotify question,

2:49:31.820 --> 2:49:32.820
 to use just one example,

2:49:32.820 --> 2:49:35.480
 there's a lot of people who are doing similar things.

2:49:36.820 --> 2:49:39.660
 In this day and age, we used to just sell MP3 files.

2:49:39.660 --> 2:49:41.060
 And all you had to have was an MP3 player,

2:49:41.060 --> 2:49:42.660
 it's cheap and dirty.

2:49:42.660 --> 2:49:45.140
 Now, every time there's an OS upgrade,

2:49:45.140 --> 2:49:46.720
 something breaks for us.

2:49:46.720 --> 2:49:49.340
 So we're having, I mean, my choices are at this point

2:49:49.340 --> 2:49:51.460
 to start hiring staff, more staff,

2:49:51.460 --> 2:49:54.260
 and then be a human resources manager.

2:49:54.260 --> 2:49:55.980
 I mean, the pirate radio side of this

2:49:55.980 --> 2:49:57.300
 was the pirate radio side of this

2:49:57.300 --> 2:49:58.500
 because you didn't need anybody,

2:49:58.500 --> 2:50:00.340
 but you know, you or you and another,

2:50:00.340 --> 2:50:02.140
 I mean, you could just do this lean and mean,

2:50:02.140 --> 2:50:05.280
 and it's becoming hard to do it lean and mean now.

2:50:05.280 --> 2:50:07.460
 So if somebody like a Spotify comes in and says,

2:50:07.460 --> 2:50:10.780
 hey, we'll handle that stuff for you.

2:50:10.780 --> 2:50:12.640
 In the past, I would just say,

2:50:12.640 --> 2:50:15.300
 F off, we don't need you, I don't mind.

2:50:15.300 --> 2:50:18.300
 And I definitely am not making what we could make on this,

2:50:18.300 --> 2:50:22.420
 but what we would have to do to make that is onerous to me.

2:50:22.420 --> 2:50:25.860
 But it's becoming onerous to me day to day anyway.

2:50:25.860 --> 2:50:28.380
 And so if somebody were to come in and say,

2:50:28.380 --> 2:50:30.340
 hey, we'll pick that up for you,

2:50:30.340 --> 2:50:32.600
 we will not interfere with your content at all,

2:50:32.600 --> 2:50:34.260
 we won't, and in my case, you can't say,

2:50:34.260 --> 2:50:36.720
 we need to show a month because that ain't happening, right?

2:50:36.720 --> 2:50:40.540
 So I mean, everybody's design is different, right?

2:50:40.540 --> 2:50:43.300
 So it doesn't, you know, there's not one size fits all,

2:50:43.300 --> 2:50:47.040
 but I guess as a long time pirate podcaster,

2:50:48.740 --> 2:50:50.140
 we've been looking to partner with people,

2:50:50.140 --> 2:50:51.940
 but nobody's right for us to partner with.

2:50:51.940 --> 2:50:55.940
 I mean, so I'm always looking for ways

2:50:55.940 --> 2:50:58.300
 to take that side of it off my plate

2:50:58.300 --> 2:50:59.600
 because I'm not interested in that side.

2:50:59.600 --> 2:51:02.020
 All I wanna do is the shows,

2:51:02.020 --> 2:51:04.540
 and it's really at this point,

2:51:04.540 --> 2:51:06.500
 you shouldn't call yourself an artist

2:51:06.500 --> 2:51:08.820
 because that's something to be decided by others.

2:51:08.820 --> 2:51:11.740
 But I mean, we're trying to do art

2:51:11.740 --> 2:51:15.020
 and there's something very satisfying in that.

2:51:15.020 --> 2:51:16.780
 But the part that I can't stand

2:51:16.780 --> 2:51:19.280
 is the increasing amount of time

2:51:19.280 --> 2:51:22.220
 the monetization question takes upon us.

2:51:22.220 --> 2:51:26.460
 So there's a case to be made, I guess is what I'm saying,

2:51:26.460 --> 2:51:29.700
 that if a partnership with some outside firm

2:51:29.700 --> 2:51:32.500
 enhances your ability to do the art

2:51:32.500 --> 2:51:36.100
 without disenhancing your ability to do the art,

2:51:36.100 --> 2:51:41.100
 it's, the word I'm looking for here is it's enticing.

2:51:42.260 --> 2:51:44.500
 I don't like big companies.

2:51:44.500 --> 2:51:49.500
 So I'm afraid of whatever strings might come with that.

2:51:49.540 --> 2:51:52.220
 And if I'm Joe Rogan and I'm talking about subjects

2:51:52.220 --> 2:51:55.860
 that can make public companies a little nervous,

2:51:55.860 --> 2:51:57.300
 I would certainly be careful.

2:51:57.300 --> 2:52:00.520
 But at the same time, people who are not in this game

2:52:00.520 --> 2:52:04.540
 don't understand the problems that literally,

2:52:04.540 --> 2:52:07.580
 I mean, just all the operating systems, all the podcatchers,

2:52:07.580 --> 2:52:09.440
 every time some new podcatcher comes up,

2:52:09.440 --> 2:52:10.980
 makes it easier to get the podcast,

2:52:10.980 --> 2:52:14.220
 that's something we have to account for on the back end.

2:52:14.220 --> 2:52:17.740
 And I'm not exactly the technological wizard of all time.

2:52:17.740 --> 2:52:21.900
 So I think it is maybe, maybe the short answer is,

2:52:21.900 --> 2:52:24.300
 is that as the medium develops,

2:52:24.300 --> 2:52:26.860
 it's becoming something that you have to consider,

2:52:26.860 --> 2:52:28.900
 not because you wanna sell out,

2:52:28.900 --> 2:52:30.420
 but because you wanna keep going.

2:52:30.420 --> 2:52:34.020
 And it's becoming harder and harder to be pirate like

2:52:34.020 --> 2:52:35.420
 in this environment.

2:52:35.420 --> 2:52:39.060
 The thing that convinced me, especially inside Spotify,

2:52:39.060 --> 2:52:41.720
 is that they understand,

2:52:41.720 --> 2:52:45.960
 so if you walk into this whole thing with some skepticism,

2:52:45.960 --> 2:52:48.360
 as you're saying, of big companies,

2:52:48.360 --> 2:52:52.080
 then it works because Spotify understands the magic

2:52:52.080 --> 2:52:56.520
 that makes podcasting, or they appear to in part,

2:52:56.520 --> 2:53:00.240
 at least they understand enough to respect Joe Rogan.

2:53:00.240 --> 2:53:02.920
 And despite what, I don't know if you,

2:53:02.920 --> 2:53:04.520
 so there's the internet and there's people

2:53:04.520 --> 2:53:05.800
 with opinions on the internet.

2:53:05.800 --> 2:53:06.640
 Really? Yes.

2:53:06.640 --> 2:53:07.880
 I've not heard about that.

2:53:07.880 --> 2:53:11.920
 And they have opinions about Joe and Spotify.

2:53:11.920 --> 2:53:14.760
 But the reality is, there's two things

2:53:14.760 --> 2:53:16.720
 in private conversation with Joe,

2:53:16.720 --> 2:53:19.520
 and in general, there's two important things.

2:53:19.520 --> 2:53:22.800
 One, Spotify literally doesn't tell Joe anything.

2:53:22.800 --> 2:53:25.800
 Like all the people that think that Spotify

2:53:25.800 --> 2:53:28.200
 is somehow pushing Joe in this direction.

2:53:28.200 --> 2:53:30.520
 It's a contractual, didn't he insist upon that?

2:53:30.520 --> 2:53:31.360
 It's in the contract.

2:53:31.360 --> 2:53:34.000
 But also, companies have a way of,

2:53:34.000 --> 2:53:36.000
 even with the contract. They sure do.

2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:39.040
 To be marketing people, hey, I know we're not forcing you.

2:53:39.040 --> 2:53:39.880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:53:39.880 --> 2:53:41.080
 I hate that.

2:53:41.080 --> 2:53:42.840
 Yeah, I'm with you.

2:53:42.840 --> 2:53:44.400
 You and Joe are the same,

2:53:44.400 --> 2:53:45.960
 and Spotify is smart enough

2:53:45.960 --> 2:53:48.280
 not to send a single email of that kind.

2:53:48.280 --> 2:53:49.600
 That's really smart.

2:53:49.600 --> 2:53:51.320
 And they leave them be.

2:53:51.320 --> 2:53:55.840
 There is meetings inside Spotify that people complain,

2:53:55.840 --> 2:53:58.040
 but those meetings never reach Joe.

2:53:58.040 --> 2:54:00.440
 That's like company stuff.

2:54:00.440 --> 2:54:04.760
 And the idea that Spotify is different than pirate radio,

2:54:04.760 --> 2:54:07.320
 the difficult thing about podcasting

2:54:07.320 --> 2:54:10.120
 is nobody gives a damn about your podcast.

2:54:10.120 --> 2:54:11.760
 You're alone in this.

2:54:11.760 --> 2:54:14.000
 I mean, there's fans and stuff, but nobody.

2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:15.040
 Nobody's looking out for you.

2:54:15.040 --> 2:54:15.880
 Yeah. Yeah.

2:54:15.880 --> 2:54:17.360
 And the nice thing about Spotify

2:54:17.360 --> 2:54:21.720
 is they want Joe's podcast to succeed even more.

2:54:21.720 --> 2:54:23.960
 That's what Joe talked about

2:54:23.960 --> 2:54:27.080
 is that's the difference between YouTube and Spotify.

2:54:27.080 --> 2:54:30.000
 Spotify wants to be the Netflix of podcasting.

2:54:30.000 --> 2:54:32.360
 And they, like what Netflix does

2:54:32.360 --> 2:54:37.160
 is they don't want to control you in any way,

2:54:37.160 --> 2:54:40.680
 but they want to create a platform where you can flourish.

2:54:40.680 --> 2:54:41.520
 Even more.

2:54:41.520 --> 2:54:42.360
 Because your interests are aligned.

2:54:42.360 --> 2:54:43.200
 Interests are aligned.

2:54:43.200 --> 2:54:45.560
 So let me bring up something that,

2:54:45.560 --> 2:54:46.600
 let's make a distinction

2:54:46.600 --> 2:54:50.520
 because not all companies who do this are the same.

2:54:50.520 --> 2:54:52.080
 And you brought up YouTube and Spotify,

2:54:52.080 --> 2:54:55.000
 but to me, YouTube is at least more like Spotify

2:54:55.000 --> 2:54:56.760
 than some of these smaller.

2:54:56.760 --> 2:54:58.560
 The term is walled garden, right?

2:54:58.560 --> 2:54:59.800
 You've heard the term walled garden?

2:54:59.800 --> 2:55:00.640
 Yes. Okay.

2:55:00.640 --> 2:55:04.080
 So I've been around podcasting so long now

2:55:04.080 --> 2:55:07.200
 that I've seen rounds of consolidation over the years

2:55:07.200 --> 2:55:09.520
 and they come in waves and all of a sudden,

2:55:09.520 --> 2:55:12.120
 so you'll get, and I'm not going to mention any names,

2:55:12.120 --> 2:55:13.840
 but up until recently,

2:55:13.840 --> 2:55:16.880
 the consolidation was happening with relatively small firms

2:55:16.880 --> 2:55:18.840
 compared to people like Spotify.

2:55:18.840 --> 2:55:20.160
 And the problem was,

2:55:20.160 --> 2:55:23.360
 is that by deciding to consolidate your materials

2:55:23.360 --> 2:55:25.000
 in a walled garden,

2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:28.360
 you are walling yourself off from audience, right?

2:55:28.360 --> 2:55:30.400
 So your choice is I'm going to accept this amount of money

2:55:30.400 --> 2:55:31.240
 from this company,

2:55:31.240 --> 2:55:33.960
 but the loss is going to be a large chunk of my audience.

2:55:33.960 --> 2:55:35.200
 And that's a catch 22

2:55:35.200 --> 2:55:37.480
 because you're negotiating power with that company

2:55:37.480 --> 2:55:39.280
 is based on your audience size.

2:55:39.280 --> 2:55:41.360
 So signing up with them diminishes your audience size,

2:55:41.360 --> 2:55:43.400
 you lose negotiating power.

2:55:43.400 --> 2:55:46.840
 But when you get to the level of the Spotify

2:55:46.840 --> 2:55:49.480
 to just pick them out, there's other players,

2:55:49.480 --> 2:55:51.480
 but you brought up Spotify specifically,

2:55:51.480 --> 2:55:54.320
 these are people who can potentially,

2:55:54.320 --> 2:55:57.880
 potentially enhance your audience over time.

2:55:57.880 --> 2:56:00.800
 And so the risk to you is lower

2:56:00.800 --> 2:56:03.440
 because if you decide in a year or two,

2:56:03.440 --> 2:56:05.880
 whatever the licensing agreements term is,

2:56:05.880 --> 2:56:07.840
 that you're done with them and you want to leave,

2:56:07.840 --> 2:56:09.640
 instead of how you would have been

2:56:09.640 --> 2:56:11.560
 with some of these smaller walled gardens,

2:56:11.560 --> 2:56:14.320
 where you're walking away with a fraction of the audience

2:56:14.320 --> 2:56:15.560
 you walked in with,

2:56:15.560 --> 2:56:17.660
 you have the potential to walk out

2:56:17.660 --> 2:56:19.760
 with whatever you got in the original deal,

2:56:19.760 --> 2:56:21.240
 plus a larger audience,

2:56:21.240 --> 2:56:22.840
 because their algorithms and everything

2:56:22.840 --> 2:56:26.440
 are designed to push people to your content

2:56:26.440 --> 2:56:27.520
 if they think you'd like.

2:56:27.520 --> 2:56:31.320
 So it takes away some of the downside risk,

2:56:31.320 --> 2:56:33.280
 which alleviates,

2:56:33.280 --> 2:56:35.320
 and if you can write an agreement like Joe Rogan,

2:56:35.320 --> 2:56:37.560
 I mean, where you've protected your freedom

2:56:37.560 --> 2:56:39.340
 to put the content out the way you want.

2:56:39.340 --> 2:56:42.320
 So, and if some of the downside risk is mitigated,

2:56:42.320 --> 2:56:45.840
 and if you eliminate the problem of trying to monetize

2:56:45.840 --> 2:56:47.560
 and stay up with the latest tech,

2:56:47.560 --> 2:56:49.240
 then it might be worth it.

2:56:49.240 --> 2:56:51.040
 You know, I'm scared of things like that,

2:56:51.040 --> 2:56:51.960
 but at the same time,

2:56:51.960 --> 2:56:54.780
 I'm trying to not be an idiot about it,

2:56:54.780 --> 2:56:56.760
 and I can be an idiot about it.

2:56:56.760 --> 2:56:59.360
 And when you've been doing it as independently

2:56:59.360 --> 2:57:00.800
 for as long as I have,

2:57:00.800 --> 2:57:04.640
 the inertia of that has a force all its own,

2:57:04.640 --> 2:57:09.560
 but I'm inhibited enough in what I'm trying to do

2:57:09.560 --> 2:57:10.840
 on this other end,

2:57:10.840 --> 2:57:13.680
 that it's opened me at least to listening to people.

2:57:14.900 --> 2:57:18.640
 But listen, at the same time, I love my audience,

2:57:18.640 --> 2:57:20.840
 and it sounds like a cliche,

2:57:20.840 --> 2:57:23.640
 but they're literally the reason I'm here.

2:57:23.640 --> 2:57:26.040
 So I wanna make sure that whatever I do,

2:57:26.040 --> 2:57:29.760
 if I can, is in keeping with a relationship

2:57:29.760 --> 2:57:32.900
 that I've developed with these people over 15 years.

2:57:34.160 --> 2:57:36.560
 But like you said, no matter what you do,

2:57:36.560 --> 2:57:38.120
 you are, because see, here's the thing.

2:57:38.120 --> 2:57:40.020
 If you don't sign up with one of those companies

2:57:40.020 --> 2:57:42.660
 to make it easier for them to get your stuff on this hand,

2:57:42.660 --> 2:57:45.100
 they might yell at you for how difficult it is,

2:57:45.100 --> 2:57:48.080
 because the new operating system just updated,

2:57:48.080 --> 2:57:49.120
 and you said, I can't get your stuff.

2:57:49.120 --> 2:57:52.120
 So either way, you're opening yourself up to ridicule

2:57:52.120 --> 2:57:52.960
 at this point.

2:57:52.960 --> 2:57:55.200
 All of that makes it easier to go,

2:57:55.200 --> 2:57:56.840
 well, if the right deal came along,

2:57:56.840 --> 2:57:57.680
 and they weren't screwing me,

2:57:57.680 --> 2:58:00.500
 and they weren't screwing my audience, and blah, blah, blah.

2:58:00.500 --> 2:58:01.880
 I mean, again, in this business,

2:58:01.880 --> 2:58:03.800
 when you're talking about cutting edge technology

2:58:03.800 --> 2:58:04.940
 that is ever changing,

2:58:04.940 --> 2:58:08.040
 and as you said, a million podcasts and growing,

2:58:08.040 --> 2:58:10.760
 I think you have to try to maintain flexibility,

2:58:10.760 --> 2:58:14.080
 and especially if they can mitigate the downside risk,

2:58:14.080 --> 2:58:19.080
 I think you'd be an idiot to not at least try to stay up

2:58:19.080 --> 2:58:20.040
 on the current trends.

2:58:20.040 --> 2:58:22.120
 And look, I'm watching Joe.

2:58:22.120 --> 2:58:24.280
 I'm going, okay, let's see how it goes for Joe.

2:58:24.280 --> 2:58:26.700
 I mean, if he's like, ah, this is terrible,

2:58:26.700 --> 2:58:27.540
 I'm getting out of this,

2:58:27.540 --> 2:58:29.640
 you go, okay, those people are off the list.

2:58:29.640 --> 2:58:31.840
 So Joe's put himself out as a guinea pig,

2:58:31.840 --> 2:58:34.000
 and the rest of us guinea pigs appreciate it.

2:58:34.000 --> 2:58:36.560
 As a huge, as a fan of your show,

2:58:36.560 --> 2:58:40.400
 and as a fan of Netflix, the people there,

2:58:40.400 --> 2:58:44.000
 I think I can speak for like millions of people

2:58:44.000 --> 2:58:46.920
 in hope that hardcore history comes to Netflix,

2:58:46.920 --> 2:58:49.520
 or if Spotify becomes the Netflix of podcasting,

2:58:49.520 --> 2:58:50.720
 then to Spotify.

2:58:50.720 --> 2:58:53.020
 There's something at its best

2:58:53.020 --> 2:58:56.080
 that they bring out the, you said artists,

2:58:56.080 --> 2:58:57.600
 so I can say it,

2:58:57.600 --> 2:58:59.720
 is they bring out the best out of the artists.

2:58:59.720 --> 2:59:02.820
 They remove some of the headache,

2:59:02.820 --> 2:59:07.820
 and somehow like they put at their best,

2:59:08.160 --> 2:59:11.760
 Netflix, for example, is able to enforce

2:59:11.760 --> 2:59:14.420
 and find the beauty and the power

2:59:14.420 --> 2:59:17.800
 in the creations that you make even better than you.

2:59:17.800 --> 2:59:20.580
 Like they don't interfere with the creations,

2:59:20.580 --> 2:59:24.400
 but they somehow, it's a branding thing probably too.

2:59:24.400 --> 2:59:25.240
 Yeah, but interfering would be,

2:59:25.240 --> 2:59:26.520
 that would be a no go for me.

2:59:26.520 --> 2:59:28.000
 That's right, absolutely.

2:59:28.000 --> 2:59:28.840
 That can't happen.

2:59:28.840 --> 2:59:31.000
 But that's why Netflix is masterful.

2:59:31.000 --> 2:59:34.020
 They seem to not interfere with the talent,

2:59:34.020 --> 2:59:36.460
 as opposed to, I could throw other people under the bus,

2:59:36.460 --> 2:59:37.300
 like Amazon.

2:59:37.300 --> 2:59:38.400
 There's a lot of places under the bus

2:59:38.400 --> 2:59:39.800
 that could be thrown, absolutely.

2:59:39.800 --> 2:59:41.800
 So I would love, I know there's probably

2:59:41.800 --> 2:59:43.560
 people screaming yes right now.

2:59:43.560 --> 2:59:45.520
 In terms of hardcore history on Netflix,

2:59:45.520 --> 2:59:46.520
 it would be awesome.

2:59:46.520 --> 2:59:51.120
 And I don't love asking this question,

2:59:51.120 --> 2:59:55.580
 but it's asked probably the most popular question

2:59:55.580 --> 2:59:57.060
 that's unanswerable.

2:59:57.060 --> 2:59:59.320
 So let me try to ask it in a way

2:59:59.320 --> 3:00:01.520
 that you would actually answer it,

3:00:01.520 --> 3:00:02.760
 which is, of course, you said

3:00:02.760 --> 3:00:05.040
 you don't release shows very often.

3:00:05.040 --> 3:00:08.760
 And the question is, or the requests and the questions is,

3:00:08.760 --> 3:00:11.760
 well, can you tell Dan to do one on the Civil War?

3:00:11.760 --> 3:00:14.240
 Can you tell Dan to do one on the Napoleon Bonaparte?

3:00:14.240 --> 3:00:16.400
 Can you tell him to do one?

3:00:16.400 --> 3:00:18.660
 Every topic, and you've spoken to this.

3:00:18.660 --> 3:00:20.040
 Actually, your answer about the Civil War

3:00:20.040 --> 3:00:21.040
 is quite interesting.

3:00:21.040 --> 3:00:22.880
 I didn't know you knew what my answer

3:00:22.880 --> 3:00:24.880
 about the Civil War was.

3:00:24.880 --> 3:00:27.520
 As a military historian, you enjoy, in particular,

3:00:27.520 --> 3:00:29.960
 when there is differences in the armies,

3:00:29.960 --> 3:00:32.400
 as opposed to contrasts.

3:00:32.400 --> 3:00:34.680
 With the Civil War, which blew my mind

3:00:34.680 --> 3:00:38.880
 when I heard you say there's not an interesting,

3:00:38.880 --> 3:00:42.200
 a deep, intricate contrast between the two opposing sides.

3:00:42.200 --> 3:00:43.120
 It's like the Roman Civil Wars,

3:00:43.120 --> 3:00:45.520
 where it's legionary against legionary.

3:00:45.520 --> 3:00:49.080
 And you've also said that the shows you work on

3:00:49.080 --> 3:00:51.320
 are ones where you have some roots

3:00:51.320 --> 3:00:54.720
 of fundamental understanding about that period.

3:00:54.720 --> 3:00:57.380
 And so, when you work on a show,

3:00:57.380 --> 3:01:00.360
 it's basically pulling at those strings further

3:01:00.360 --> 3:01:02.960
 and refreshing your mind and learning.

3:01:02.960 --> 3:01:04.680
 You have definitely done the research.

3:01:04.680 --> 3:01:06.280
 Wow, these are words out of my mouth.

3:01:06.280 --> 3:01:07.680
 Yeah, you're right.

3:01:07.680 --> 3:01:12.680
 But is there something like shower thoughts on Reddit?

3:01:12.680 --> 3:01:16.920
 Is there some ideas that are lingering in your head

3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:19.600
 about possible future episodes?

3:01:19.600 --> 3:01:23.960
 Is there things that, whether you're not committing

3:01:23.960 --> 3:01:27.840
 to anything, but whether you're gonna do it or not,

3:01:27.840 --> 3:01:29.920
 is there something that makes you think,

3:01:29.920 --> 3:01:34.040
 hmm, that'll be interesting to pull at that thread

3:01:34.040 --> 3:01:35.600
 a little bit?

3:01:35.600 --> 3:01:38.400
 Oh yeah, we have things we keep in our back pocket

3:01:38.400 --> 3:01:39.240
 for later.

3:01:39.240 --> 3:01:42.280
 So, Blueprint for Armageddon, the first World War series

3:01:42.280 --> 3:01:44.840
 we did, that was in my back pocket the whole time.

3:01:44.840 --> 3:01:47.320
 And when the centennial of the war happened,

3:01:47.320 --> 3:01:50.400
 it just seemed to be the likely time to bring out what was.

3:01:50.400 --> 3:01:51.800
 That was a hell of a series.

3:01:51.800 --> 3:01:53.240
 That's probably one of my favorite series.

3:01:53.240 --> 3:01:54.600
 Take my rear end, man.

3:01:54.600 --> 3:01:55.440
 I have to tell you.

3:01:55.440 --> 3:01:56.280
 Psychologically, you mean?

3:01:56.280 --> 3:01:58.660
 Well, just, you know, when you get to these,

3:01:58.660 --> 3:02:01.640
 I think, I'm guessing here, I think it's 26 hours,

3:02:01.640 --> 3:02:02.840
 all pieces together.

3:02:02.840 --> 3:02:05.360
 Think about, and we don't do scripts.

3:02:05.360 --> 3:02:06.560
 It's improvised.

3:02:06.560 --> 3:02:10.320
 So, think about what, I had somebody write on Twitter

3:02:10.320 --> 3:02:13.200
 just yesterday saying, he said something like,

3:02:13.200 --> 3:02:14.760
 I'm not seeing the dedication here.

3:02:14.760 --> 3:02:16.760
 You're only getting 2.5 shows out a year.

3:02:16.760 --> 3:02:20.380
 And I wanted to say, man, you have no idea what,

3:02:20.380 --> 3:02:22.480
 the only people who understand really

3:02:22.480 --> 3:02:24.360
 are other history podcasters.

3:02:24.360 --> 3:02:27.440
 And even they don't generally do 26 hours.

3:02:27.440 --> 3:02:29.920
 You know, that was a two year endeavor.

3:02:29.920 --> 3:02:32.000
 As I said, the first show we ever did was like 15 minutes.

3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:33.840
 I could crank out one of those a month.

3:02:33.840 --> 3:02:36.140
 But when you're doing, I mean, the last show we did

3:02:36.140 --> 3:02:39.040
 on the fall of the Roman Republic was five and a half hours.

3:02:39.040 --> 3:02:41.320
 That's a book, right?

3:02:41.320 --> 3:02:43.040
 And it was part six or something.

3:02:43.040 --> 3:02:44.640
 So, I mean, you just do the math.

3:02:45.560 --> 3:02:47.800
 And it felt like you were, sorry to interrupt,

3:02:47.800 --> 3:02:51.760
 on World War I, it felt like you were emotionally

3:02:51.760 --> 3:02:53.760
 pulled in to it.

3:02:53.760 --> 3:02:55.280
 Like, it felt taxing.

3:02:55.280 --> 3:02:56.440
 I was gonna say, that's a good thing though,

3:02:56.440 --> 3:02:58.780
 because that, you know, and I think we said during the show,

3:02:58.780 --> 3:03:01.880
 that was the feeling that the people at the time have.

3:03:01.880 --> 3:03:03.400
 And I think at one point we said,

3:03:03.400 --> 3:03:06.940
 if this is starting to seem gruesomely repetitive,

3:03:06.940 --> 3:03:10.160
 now you know how the people at the time felt.

3:03:10.160 --> 3:03:13.500
 So in other words, that had sort of inadvertently,

3:03:13.500 --> 3:03:14.620
 because when you improvise a show,

3:03:14.620 --> 3:03:16.360
 some of these things are inadvertent,

3:03:16.360 --> 3:03:20.160
 but it had inadvertently created the right climate

3:03:20.160 --> 3:03:24.440
 for having a sense of empathy with the storyline.

3:03:24.440 --> 3:03:26.880
 And to me, those are the serendipitous moments

3:03:26.880 --> 3:03:31.000
 that make this art and not some sort of paint by the numbers

3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:32.280
 kind of endeavor, you know?

3:03:32.280 --> 3:03:35.160
 And that's, to me, that wouldn't have happened

3:03:35.160 --> 3:03:36.920
 had we scripted it out.

3:03:36.920 --> 3:03:40.680
 So it's mostly, you just bring the tools of knowledge

3:03:40.680 --> 3:03:44.240
 to the table and then in large part improvise,

3:03:44.240 --> 3:03:45.520
 like the actual wording?

3:03:45.520 --> 3:03:47.240
 I always say we make it like they made things

3:03:47.240 --> 3:03:49.360
 like spinal tap and some of those other things

3:03:49.360 --> 3:03:52.840
 where the material, so I do have notes about things

3:03:52.840 --> 3:03:55.540
 like on page 427 of this book, you have this quote,

3:03:55.540 --> 3:03:57.280
 so that I know, aha, I'm at the point

3:03:57.280 --> 3:03:58.760
 where I can drop that in.

3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:00.600
 And sometimes I'll write notes saying,

3:04:00.600 --> 3:04:03.960
 here's where you left off yesterday, so I remember.

3:04:03.960 --> 3:04:07.440
 But in the improvisation, you end up throwing a lot out.

3:04:07.440 --> 3:04:10.560
 And so like, but it allows us to go off on tangents,

3:04:10.560 --> 3:04:11.440
 like we'll try things.

3:04:11.440 --> 3:04:12.560
 Like I'll sit there and go,

3:04:12.560 --> 3:04:14.080
 I wonder what this would sound like.

3:04:14.080 --> 3:04:16.900
 And I'll spend two days going down that road

3:04:16.900 --> 3:04:18.560
 and then I'll listen to it and go, it doesn't work.

3:04:18.560 --> 3:04:20.840
 But that's, you know, like writers do this all the time.

3:04:20.840 --> 3:04:22.280
 It's called killing your babies, right?

3:04:22.280 --> 3:04:24.600
 You got, can't, you know, but people go,

3:04:24.600 --> 3:04:26.400
 so this guy goes, I'm not seeing the dedication.

3:04:26.400 --> 3:04:28.920
 He has no idea how many things we're throwing out.

3:04:28.920 --> 3:04:30.720
 I did an hour and a half,

3:04:30.720 --> 3:04:32.560
 I had an hour and a half into The Current Show

3:04:32.560 --> 3:04:34.440
 about two months ago.

3:04:34.440 --> 3:04:36.280
 And I listened to it and I just went, you know what?

3:04:36.280 --> 3:04:37.120
 It's not right.

3:04:37.120 --> 3:04:37.940
 Boom, out the window.

3:04:37.940 --> 3:04:41.000
 There goes six weeks of work, right?

3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:42.480
 But here's the problem.

3:04:42.480 --> 3:04:43.800
 Do you trust your, sorry to interrupt,

3:04:43.800 --> 3:04:45.400
 do you trust your judgment on that?

3:04:45.400 --> 3:04:48.400
 No, no.

3:04:48.400 --> 3:04:50.260
 But here's the thing.

3:04:51.960 --> 3:04:54.100
 Our show is a little different than other people's.

3:04:54.100 --> 3:04:56.380
 Joe Rogan called it evergreen content.

3:04:56.380 --> 3:04:59.800
 In other words, my political show is like a car you buy.

3:04:59.800 --> 3:05:01.520
 And the minute you drive it off the lot,

3:05:01.520 --> 3:05:03.000
 it loses half its value, right?

3:05:03.000 --> 3:05:04.560
 Cause it's not current anymore.

3:05:04.560 --> 3:05:07.840
 These shows are just as good or just as bad

3:05:07.840 --> 3:05:09.640
 five years from now as they are when we,

3:05:09.640 --> 3:05:11.360
 although the standards on the internet changed.

3:05:11.360 --> 3:05:12.440
 So when I listen to my old shows,

3:05:12.440 --> 3:05:14.000
 I cringe sometimes cause the standards

3:05:14.000 --> 3:05:15.240
 are so much higher now.

3:05:15.240 --> 3:05:18.060
 But when you're creating evergreen content,

3:05:18.060 --> 3:05:20.320
 you have two audiences to worry about.

3:05:20.320 --> 3:05:22.560
 You have the audience that's waiting for the next show

3:05:22.560 --> 3:05:23.720
 and they've already heard the other ones

3:05:23.720 --> 3:05:25.360
 and they're impatient and they're telling you on Twitter,

3:05:25.360 --> 3:05:26.240
 where is it?

3:05:26.240 --> 3:05:27.120
 But you have show,

3:05:27.120 --> 3:05:29.080
 the show is also for people five years from now

3:05:29.080 --> 3:05:30.440
 who haven't discovered it yet

3:05:30.440 --> 3:05:32.880
 and who don't care a wit for how long it took

3:05:32.880 --> 3:05:34.880
 cause they're gonna be able to download the whole,

3:05:34.880 --> 3:05:36.840
 and all they care about is quality.

3:05:36.840 --> 3:05:40.200
 And so what I always tell new podcasters is,

3:05:40.200 --> 3:05:41.640
 they always say, I read all these things,

3:05:41.640 --> 3:05:44.440
 it's very important you have a release schedule.

3:05:44.440 --> 3:05:45.480
 Well, it's not more important

3:05:45.480 --> 3:05:47.280
 than putting out a good piece of work.

3:05:47.280 --> 3:05:52.040
 And the audience will forgive me if it takes too long,

3:05:52.040 --> 3:05:53.880
 but it's really good when you get it.

3:05:53.880 --> 3:05:55.720
 They will not forgive me if I rush it

3:05:55.720 --> 3:05:58.320
 to get it out on time and it's a piece of crap.

3:05:58.320 --> 3:06:00.800
 So for us, and this is why when you brought up

3:06:00.800 --> 3:06:02.480
 a Spotify deal or anything else,

3:06:02.480 --> 3:06:04.160
 they can't interfere with this at all

3:06:04.160 --> 3:06:07.920
 because my job here, as far as I'm concerned is quality

3:06:07.920 --> 3:06:10.240
 and everything else goes by the wayside

3:06:10.240 --> 3:06:12.480
 because the only thing people care about longterm,

3:06:12.480 --> 3:06:15.760
 the only thing that gives you longevity is how good is it?

3:06:15.760 --> 3:06:16.720
 How good is that book?

3:06:16.720 --> 3:06:19.320
 If you read J.R.R. Tolkien's work tomorrow,

3:06:19.320 --> 3:06:21.200
 you don't care how long it took him to write it,

3:06:21.200 --> 3:06:22.720
 all you care is how good is it today?

3:06:22.720 --> 3:06:24.120
 And that's what we try to think too.

3:06:24.120 --> 3:06:27.120
 And I feel like if it's good, if it's really good,

3:06:27.120 --> 3:06:30.600
 everything else falls into place and takes care of itself.

3:06:30.600 --> 3:06:33.440
 And so sometimes to push back, sorry to interrupt.

3:06:33.440 --> 3:06:34.720
 I've done it to you a thousand times,

3:06:34.720 --> 3:06:36.160
 so you can get me back, please.

3:06:36.160 --> 3:06:40.560
 Sometimes the deadline, some of the greatest movies

3:06:40.560 --> 3:06:43.760
 and books have been, you think about like Dostoevsky,

3:06:43.760 --> 3:06:46.000
 I forget which one, notes from underground or something.

3:06:46.000 --> 3:06:49.040
 He needed the money, so he had to write it real quick.

3:06:49.040 --> 3:06:53.920
 Sometimes the deadline creates is powerful

3:06:53.920 --> 3:06:57.280
 at taking a creative mind of an artist

3:06:57.280 --> 3:06:59.480
 and just like slapping it around

3:06:59.480 --> 3:07:01.160
 to force some of the good stuff out.

3:07:01.160 --> 3:07:02.720
 Now, the problem with history, of course,

3:07:02.720 --> 3:07:05.480
 is there's different definitions of good

3:07:06.480 --> 3:07:09.160
 that like it's not just about which you talk about,

3:07:09.160 --> 3:07:10.320
 which is the storytelling,

3:07:10.320 --> 3:07:12.000
 the richness of the storytelling.

3:07:12.000 --> 3:07:15.560
 And I'm sure you're, again, not to compliment you too much,

3:07:15.560 --> 3:07:18.200
 but you're one of the great storytellers of our time

3:07:18.200 --> 3:07:21.040
 that I'm sure if you put in a jail cell

3:07:21.040 --> 3:07:24.360
 and forced like somebody pointed a gun at you,

3:07:24.360 --> 3:07:26.280
 you could tell one hell of a good story,

3:07:26.280 --> 3:07:28.720
 but you still need the facts of history

3:07:29.600 --> 3:07:31.280
 or not necessarily the facts,

3:07:31.280 --> 3:07:36.000
 but like making sure you're painting the right full picture,

3:07:36.000 --> 3:07:37.280
 not perfectly right.

3:07:37.280 --> 3:07:38.480
 That's what I meant about the audience

3:07:38.480 --> 3:07:39.880
 doesn't understand what a history podcast,

3:07:39.880 --> 3:07:41.680
 you can't just riff and be wrong.

3:07:41.680 --> 3:07:45.600
 So let me both oppose what you just said

3:07:45.600 --> 3:07:47.320
 and back up what you just said.

3:07:47.320 --> 3:07:49.360
 So I have a book that I wrote, right?

3:07:49.360 --> 3:07:52.280
 And in a book you have a hard deadline, right?

3:07:52.280 --> 3:07:54.960
 So Harper Collins had a hard deadline on that book.

3:07:54.960 --> 3:07:57.560
 So when I released it, I was mad

3:07:57.560 --> 3:07:59.520
 because I would have worked on it a lot longer,

3:07:59.520 --> 3:08:00.800
 which is my style, right?

3:08:00.800 --> 3:08:02.320
 Get it right.

3:08:02.320 --> 3:08:04.600
 But we had a chapter in that book

3:08:04.600 --> 3:08:07.920
 entitled pandemic prologue question mark.

3:08:07.920 --> 3:08:10.680
 And it was the book about the part about the black death

3:08:10.680 --> 3:08:13.720
 and the 1918 flu and all that kind of stuff.

3:08:13.720 --> 3:08:15.520
 And I was just doing an interview

3:08:15.520 --> 3:08:18.080
 with a Spanish journalist this morning who said,

3:08:18.080 --> 3:08:20.040
 did you ever think how lucky you got on that?

3:08:20.040 --> 3:08:24.280
 And first of all, lucky on a pandemic, it strikes you.

3:08:24.280 --> 3:08:27.440
 But had I had my druthers,

3:08:27.440 --> 3:08:29.480
 I would have kept that book working

3:08:29.480 --> 3:08:32.240
 in my study for months more

3:08:32.240 --> 3:08:34.560
 and the pandemic would have happened.

3:08:34.560 --> 3:08:36.560
 And that would have looked like a chapter

3:08:36.560 --> 3:08:37.880
 I wrote after the fact.

3:08:37.880 --> 3:08:39.680
 I would have had to rewrite the whole thing.

3:08:39.680 --> 3:08:42.680
 So that argues for what you said.

3:08:42.680 --> 3:08:45.920
 At the same time, I would have spent months more

3:08:45.920 --> 3:08:47.080
 working on it because to me,

3:08:47.080 --> 3:08:49.720
 it didn't look the way I wanted it to look yet.

3:08:49.720 --> 3:08:51.960
 Can you drop a hint of the things

3:08:51.960 --> 3:08:53.440
 that you're keeping on the shelves?

3:08:53.440 --> 3:08:55.080
 Oh, the Alexander the Great podcast.

3:08:55.080 --> 3:08:58.080
 I've talked around, I talked to somebody the other day,

3:08:58.080 --> 3:09:00.560
 he said, do you know that the very first word

3:09:00.560 --> 3:09:02.880
 in your very first podcast, in the title,

3:09:02.880 --> 3:09:04.400
 the very first thing that anybody ever saw

3:09:04.400 --> 3:09:07.840
 with hardcore history is the word Alexander.

3:09:07.840 --> 3:09:10.080
 Because the show's entitled Alexander versus Hitler.

3:09:10.080 --> 3:09:12.120
 I have talked around the career.

3:09:12.120 --> 3:09:13.040
 I've done show after,

3:09:13.040 --> 3:09:14.960
 I talked about his mother in one episode.

3:09:14.960 --> 3:09:18.240
 I talked about the funeral games after his death.

3:09:18.240 --> 3:09:19.400
 I've talked around this,

3:09:19.400 --> 3:09:22.840
 I've specifically left this giant Alexandrian size hole

3:09:22.840 --> 3:09:23.680
 in the middle,

3:09:23.680 --> 3:09:24.920
 because we're gonna do that show one day

3:09:24.920 --> 3:09:27.640
 and I'm going to lovingly enjoy talking about

3:09:27.640 --> 3:09:30.560
 this crazily interesting figure of Alexander the Great.

3:09:30.560 --> 3:09:33.280
 So that's one of the ones that's on the back pocket list.

3:09:33.280 --> 3:09:37.160
 And what we try to do is whenever this,

3:09:37.160 --> 3:09:40.600
 we're doing Second World War in Asia and the Pacific now,

3:09:40.600 --> 3:09:43.480
 I'm on part five, whenever the heck we finish this,

3:09:43.480 --> 3:09:46.160
 the tendency is to then pick a very different period

3:09:46.160 --> 3:09:49.120
 because we've had it and the audience has had it.

3:09:49.120 --> 3:09:49.960
 So it's time.

3:09:49.960 --> 3:09:53.200
 So I will eventually get to the Alexander saga.

3:09:53.200 --> 3:09:57.920
 What about just one last kind of little part of this is,

3:09:57.920 --> 3:10:00.600
 what about the other half of that first 10 minute,

3:10:00.600 --> 3:10:02.360
 15 minute episode?

3:10:02.360 --> 3:10:05.040
 Which is, so you've done quite a bit about the World War.

3:10:05.040 --> 3:10:07.720
 You've done quite a bit about Germany.

3:10:07.720 --> 3:10:12.400
 Will you ever think about doing Hitler and the Man?

3:10:12.400 --> 3:10:14.800
 It's funny because I talked earlier

3:10:14.800 --> 3:10:16.440
 about how I don't like to go back to the old shows

3:10:16.440 --> 3:10:18.040
 cause our standards have changed so much.

3:10:18.040 --> 3:10:19.640
 Well, a long time ago,

3:10:19.640 --> 3:10:24.480
 one of my standards for not getting five hour podcasts done

3:10:24.480 --> 3:10:27.160
 or not getting too deeply into them

3:10:27.160 --> 3:10:29.960
 was to flip around the interesting points.

3:10:29.960 --> 3:10:32.280
 We didn't realize we were gonna get an audience

3:10:32.280 --> 3:10:34.520
 that wanted the actual history.

3:10:34.520 --> 3:10:36.400
 We thought we could just go with,

3:10:36.400 --> 3:10:38.120
 assume the audience knew the details

3:10:38.120 --> 3:10:39.440
 and just talk about the weird stuff

3:10:39.440 --> 3:10:41.720
 that only makes up one part of the show now.

3:10:41.720 --> 3:10:44.640
 So we did a show called Nazi tidbits.

3:10:44.640 --> 3:10:46.760
 And it was just little things about,

3:10:46.760 --> 3:10:47.960
 you know, it's totally out of date now.

3:10:47.960 --> 3:10:49.240
 Like, you know, you can still buy them,

3:10:49.240 --> 3:10:50.440
 but they're out of date.

3:10:51.440 --> 3:10:53.720
 Where we dealt a little with it.

3:10:53.720 --> 3:10:54.920
 You know, it would be interesting,

3:10:54.920 --> 3:10:56.240
 but I'll give you another example.

3:10:56.240 --> 3:10:59.400
 I mean, history is not stagnant, as you know.

3:10:59.400 --> 3:11:02.120
 And we had talked about Stalin earlier

3:11:02.120 --> 3:11:04.600
 and Ghost of the Ostfront was done years ago.

3:11:04.600 --> 3:11:06.660
 And people will write me from Russia now and say,

3:11:06.660 --> 3:11:09.520
 well, your portrayal of Stalin is totally out of,

3:11:09.520 --> 3:11:13.520
 out of, it's outdated because there's all this new stuff

3:11:13.520 --> 3:11:15.080
 from the former Soviet Union.

3:11:15.080 --> 3:11:18.120
 And you do, you turn around and you go, okay, they're right.

3:11:18.120 --> 3:11:21.600
 And so when you talk about Hitler,

3:11:21.600 --> 3:11:23.160
 it's very interesting to think about

3:11:23.160 --> 3:11:24.800
 how I would do a Hitler show today

3:11:24.800 --> 3:11:27.600
 versus how I did one 10 years ago.

3:11:27.600 --> 3:11:28.680
 And you would think, well, what's new?

3:11:28.680 --> 3:11:30.600
 I mean, it happens a lot, but there's lots of new stuff

3:11:30.600 --> 3:11:31.880
 and there's lots of new scholarship.

3:11:31.880 --> 3:11:34.680
 And so, yeah, I would think that would be

3:11:34.680 --> 3:11:36.720
 an interesting one to do someday.

3:11:36.720 --> 3:11:37.840
 I haven't thought about that.

3:11:37.840 --> 3:11:39.520
 That's not in the back pocket,

3:11:39.520 --> 3:11:40.960
 but yeah, that'd be interesting.

3:11:40.960 --> 3:11:42.880
 I have a disproportionate amount of power

3:11:42.880 --> 3:11:46.320
 because I trapped you somehow in a room and,

3:11:46.320 --> 3:11:47.140
 and thereby.

3:11:47.140 --> 3:11:47.980
 During a pandemic.

3:11:47.980 --> 3:11:49.120
 During a pandemic.

3:11:49.120 --> 3:11:51.860
 So like my hope will be stuck in your head,

3:11:51.860 --> 3:11:53.280
 but after Alexander the Great,

3:11:53.280 --> 3:11:55.960
 which would be an amazing podcast,

3:11:55.960 --> 3:11:59.560
 I hope you do give a return to Hitler,

3:11:59.560 --> 3:12:03.640
 The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, which to me,

3:12:04.960 --> 3:12:06.680
 It's a contemporary book, basically.

3:12:06.680 --> 3:12:07.520
 Yeah. Yeah.

3:12:07.520 --> 3:12:08.840
 And I, exactly.

3:12:08.840 --> 3:12:10.080
 It's by a person who was there.

3:12:10.080 --> 3:12:11.360
 Shira, yeah.

3:12:11.360 --> 3:12:16.240
 I really loved that study of the man of Hitler.

3:12:16.240 --> 3:12:20.280
 And I would love to hear your study

3:12:20.280 --> 3:12:21.760
 of certain aspects of it.

3:12:21.760 --> 3:12:23.840
 Perhaps even an episode that's like more focused

3:12:23.840 --> 3:12:25.660
 on a very particular period.

3:12:27.040 --> 3:12:30.880
 I just feel like you can tell a story that it's funny.

3:12:30.880 --> 3:12:32.600
 Hitler is one of the most studied people.

3:12:32.600 --> 3:12:35.880
 And I still feel like all the stories

3:12:35.880 --> 3:12:38.000
 or most of the stories haven't been told.

3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:40.400
 Oh, and there's, listen, I've got three books at home.

3:12:40.400 --> 3:12:42.040
 I'm on all the publishers lists now.

3:12:42.040 --> 3:12:43.860
 And they just, there's young Hitler,

3:12:43.860 --> 3:12:45.040
 there's this Hitler, there's that.

3:12:45.040 --> 3:12:46.160
 I mean, I've been reading these books

3:12:46.160 --> 3:12:47.220
 and I've read about Hitler.

3:12:47.220 --> 3:12:48.800
 I read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.

3:12:48.800 --> 3:12:51.200
 My mother thought I needed to go to a psychologist

3:12:51.200 --> 3:12:53.400
 because I read it when I was six.

3:12:53.400 --> 3:12:55.640
 And she said, there's something wrong with the boy.

3:12:55.640 --> 3:12:58.080
 And, but, but she was right.

3:12:58.080 --> 3:12:59.520
 She was absolutely right.

3:12:59.520 --> 3:13:01.240
 But, but you would think that,

3:13:01.240 --> 3:13:04.220
 that something like that is pretty established fact.

3:13:04.220 --> 3:13:06.280
 And yet there's new stuff coming out all the time.

3:13:06.280 --> 3:13:07.640
 And needless to say,

3:13:07.640 --> 3:13:10.280
 Germany's been investigating this guy forever.

3:13:10.280 --> 3:13:13.120
 And sometimes it takes years to get the translations.

3:13:13.120 --> 3:13:15.200
 I took five years of German in school.

3:13:15.200 --> 3:13:16.920
 I can't read any of it.

3:13:16.920 --> 3:13:20.080
 So, I mean, and he is,

3:13:20.080 --> 3:13:22.080
 when you talk about fascinating figures,

3:13:22.080 --> 3:13:26.060
 he's so, the whole thing is so twistedly weird.

3:13:26.060 --> 3:13:28.200
 There was a, it came out a couple of years ago.

3:13:28.200 --> 3:13:31.460
 Somebody found a tape of him talking to,

3:13:31.460 --> 3:13:34.460
 I want to say it was General,

3:13:34.460 --> 3:13:36.580
 the Finnish General Mannerheim, right?

3:13:36.580 --> 3:13:39.580
 And he's just in a very normal conversation

3:13:39.580 --> 3:13:41.160
 of the sort we're having now.

3:13:41.160 --> 3:13:42.360
 And, you know, the Hitler tapes,

3:13:42.360 --> 3:13:44.420
 when you hear him normally he's ranting and raving.

3:13:44.420 --> 3:13:46.040
 But this was a very sedate.

3:13:46.040 --> 3:13:47.820
 And I wish I'd understood the German well enough

3:13:47.820 --> 3:13:48.860
 to really get a feel,

3:13:48.860 --> 3:13:51.300
 because I was reading what Germans said.

3:13:51.300 --> 3:13:55.060
 And they say, wow, you can really hear the Southern accent.

3:13:55.060 --> 3:13:56.060
 You know, little things

3:13:56.060 --> 3:13:58.640
 that only a native speaker would hear.

3:13:58.640 --> 3:13:59.560
 And I remember thinking,

3:13:59.560 --> 3:14:02.300
 this is such a different side of this twisted character.

3:14:02.300 --> 3:14:04.540
 And you would think you would always,

3:14:04.540 --> 3:14:05.980
 you would think that this was information

3:14:05.980 --> 3:14:08.740
 that was out in the rise and fall of the Third Reich,

3:14:08.740 --> 3:14:09.740
 but it wasn't.

3:14:09.740 --> 3:14:12.980
 And so this goes along with that stuff

3:14:12.980 --> 3:14:14.860
 about new stuff coming out all the time.

3:14:14.860 --> 3:14:16.820
 Alexander, new stuff coming out all the time.

3:14:16.820 --> 3:14:17.660
 Really?

3:14:17.660 --> 3:14:20.180
 Well, at least interpretations rather than factual data.

3:14:20.180 --> 3:14:21.700
 And those color your,

3:14:21.700 --> 3:14:23.380
 those give depth to your understanding.

3:14:23.380 --> 3:14:26.020
 Yes, and you want that because of the historiography.

3:14:26.020 --> 3:14:27.700
 People love that.

3:14:27.700 --> 3:14:31.000
 And that was a byproduct of my lack of credentials,

3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:34.020
 where we thought we're gonna bring in the historians,

3:14:34.020 --> 3:14:36.100
 and we call them audio footnotes,

3:14:36.100 --> 3:14:38.400
 right away for me to say, listen, I'm not a historian,

3:14:38.400 --> 3:14:41.060
 but I'll quote this guy who is so you can trust him.

3:14:41.060 --> 3:14:42.680
 But then we would quote other people

3:14:42.680 --> 3:14:44.360
 who had different views.

3:14:44.360 --> 3:14:46.380
 And people didn't realize that, you know,

3:14:46.380 --> 3:14:47.900
 if they're not history majors,

3:14:47.900 --> 3:14:49.860
 that historians don't always agree on this stuff

3:14:49.860 --> 3:14:52.260
 and that they have disagreements and they love that.

3:14:52.260 --> 3:14:55.660
 So I love the fact that there's more stuff out there

3:14:55.660 --> 3:14:58.820
 because it allows us to then bring in other points of view

3:14:58.820 --> 3:15:00.820
 and sort of maybe three dimensionalize

3:15:00.820 --> 3:15:03.220
 or flesh out the story a little bit more.

3:15:04.220 --> 3:15:05.100
 Two last questions.

3:15:05.100 --> 3:15:07.900
 One really simple, one absurdly ridiculous,

3:15:07.900 --> 3:15:09.380
 and perhaps also simple.

3:15:10.260 --> 3:15:13.460
 First, who has been and is he real?

3:15:14.600 --> 3:15:17.260
 I don't even know what you're talking about.

3:15:17.260 --> 3:15:18.380
 Very well.

3:15:18.380 --> 3:15:20.300
 How's that for an answer?

3:15:20.300 --> 3:15:22.360
 It's like asking me, is Harvey the White Rabbit real?

3:15:22.360 --> 3:15:23.580
 I don't know.

3:15:23.580 --> 3:15:25.320
 There's carrots all around the production room,

3:15:25.320 --> 3:15:27.020
 but I don't know what that means.

3:15:27.020 --> 3:15:30.180
 Well, a lot of people demanded that I prove,

3:15:30.180 --> 3:15:32.460
 I somehow figure out a way to prove the existence.

3:15:32.460 --> 3:15:35.560
 If I said he was real, people would say, no, he's not.

3:15:35.560 --> 3:15:37.580
 And if I said he was, if he wasn't real,

3:15:37.580 --> 3:15:38.500
 they would say, yes, he is.

3:15:38.500 --> 3:15:42.220
 So it's a Santa Claus Easter bunny kind of vibe there.

3:15:42.220 --> 3:15:43.220
 Yeah.

3:15:43.220 --> 3:15:44.620
 I mean, what is real anyway?

3:15:44.620 --> 3:15:47.380
 That's exactly what I told him if he exists.

3:15:48.600 --> 3:15:49.440
 Okay.

3:15:49.440 --> 3:15:51.740
 The most absurd question, I'm very sorry.

3:15:51.740 --> 3:15:53.420
 Very sorry, but then again, I'm not.

3:15:53.420 --> 3:15:55.980
 What's the meaning of it all?

3:15:55.980 --> 3:16:00.660
 You study history, human history.

3:16:03.140 --> 3:16:06.060
 Have you been able to make sense of why the hell

3:16:06.060 --> 3:16:08.500
 we're here on this spinning rock?

3:16:08.500 --> 3:16:09.940
 Does any of it even make sense?

3:16:09.940 --> 3:16:11.780
 What's the meaning of life?

3:16:13.460 --> 3:16:16.440
 What I look at sometimes that I find interesting

3:16:16.440 --> 3:16:20.780
 is certain consistencies that we have over time.

3:16:20.780 --> 3:16:24.700
 History doesn't repeat, but it has a constant,

3:16:24.700 --> 3:16:26.660
 and the constant is us.

3:16:26.660 --> 3:16:27.940
 Now we change.

3:16:27.940 --> 3:16:31.420
 I mentioned earlier the wickedly weird time we live in

3:16:31.420 --> 3:16:33.660
 with what social media is doing to us as guinea pigs,

3:16:33.660 --> 3:16:37.600
 and that's a new element, but we're still people

3:16:37.600 --> 3:16:41.780
 who are motivated by love, hate, greed, envy, sex.

3:16:41.780 --> 3:16:43.580
 I mean, all these things that would have connected us

3:16:43.580 --> 3:16:45.480
 with the ancients, right?

3:16:45.480 --> 3:16:48.020
 That's the part that always makes history sound

3:16:48.020 --> 3:16:50.940
 like it rhymes, you know?

3:16:50.940 --> 3:16:54.380
 And when you put the constant, the human element,

3:16:54.380 --> 3:16:57.300
 and you mix it with systems that are similar,

3:16:57.300 --> 3:16:59.580
 so one of the reasons that the ancient Roman Republic

3:16:59.580 --> 3:17:02.900
 is something that people point to all the time

3:17:02.900 --> 3:17:05.140
 as something that seems like we're repeating history

3:17:05.140 --> 3:17:08.780
 is because you have humans, just like you had then,

3:17:08.780 --> 3:17:12.300
 and you have a system that resembles the one we have here.

3:17:12.300 --> 3:17:14.400
 So you throw the constant in with a system

3:17:14.400 --> 3:17:17.340
 that is somewhat similar, and you begin to see things

3:17:17.340 --> 3:17:19.580
 that look like they rhyme a little.

3:17:19.580 --> 3:17:23.420
 So for me, I'm always trying to figure out more about us,

3:17:23.420 --> 3:17:28.420
 and when you show us in 500 years ago in Asia,

3:17:28.680 --> 3:17:30.780
 and 800 years ago in Africa,

3:17:30.780 --> 3:17:32.780
 and you look at all these different places

3:17:32.780 --> 3:17:34.980
 that you put the guinea pig in,

3:17:34.980 --> 3:17:37.180
 and you watch how the guinea pig responds

3:17:37.180 --> 3:17:40.000
 to the different stimuli and challenges,

3:17:40.000 --> 3:17:44.980
 I feel like it helps me flesh out a little bit more

3:17:44.980 --> 3:17:47.480
 who we are in the long timeline.

3:17:47.480 --> 3:17:49.620
 Not who we are today, specifically,

3:17:49.620 --> 3:17:51.380
 but who we've always been.

3:17:52.260 --> 3:17:53.340
 It's a personal quest.

3:17:53.340 --> 3:17:55.580
 It's not meant to educate anybody else.

3:17:55.580 --> 3:17:57.580
 It's something that fascinates me.

3:17:57.580 --> 3:18:00.540
 Do you think there's, in that common humanity

3:18:00.540 --> 3:18:03.260
 throughout history of the guinea pig,

3:18:03.260 --> 3:18:06.080
 is there a why underneath it all?

3:18:06.080 --> 3:18:07.940
 Or is it somehow, like, it feels like

3:18:07.940 --> 3:18:10.480
 it's an experiment of some sort?

3:18:10.480 --> 3:18:11.860
 Oh, now you're into it.

3:18:11.860 --> 3:18:13.260
 Elon Musk and I talked about this,

3:18:13.260 --> 3:18:14.460
 the simulation thing, right?

3:18:14.460 --> 3:18:17.860
 Nick Bostrom's, yeah, the idea that there's some kid,

3:18:17.860 --> 3:18:21.100
 and we're the equivalent of an alien's ant farm, you know?

3:18:21.100 --> 3:18:23.100
 And we hope he doesn't throw a tarantula in

3:18:23.100 --> 3:18:24.340
 just to see what happens.

3:18:26.080 --> 3:18:29.420
 I think the whys elude us.

3:18:29.420 --> 3:18:32.900
 And I think that what makes philosophy and religion

3:18:32.900 --> 3:18:34.920
 and those sorts of things so interesting

3:18:34.920 --> 3:18:38.040
 is that they grapple with the whys.

3:18:39.280 --> 3:18:44.280
 But I'm not wise enough to propose a theory

3:18:44.280 --> 3:18:46.840
 in myself, but I'm interested enough

3:18:46.840 --> 3:18:48.560
 to read all the other ones out there.

3:18:48.560 --> 3:18:51.520
 So let's put it this way.

3:18:51.520 --> 3:18:53.560
 I don't think there's any definitive why

3:18:53.560 --> 3:18:54.660
 that's been agreed upon,

3:18:54.660 --> 3:18:56.760
 but the various theories are fascinating.

3:18:56.760 --> 3:18:59.400
 Yeah, whatever it is, whoever the kid is

3:18:59.400 --> 3:19:03.360
 that created this thing, the ant farm,

3:19:03.360 --> 3:19:05.140
 it's kind of interesting.

3:19:06.080 --> 3:19:08.240
 Well, so far, a little bit twisted

3:19:08.240 --> 3:19:09.800
 and perverted and sadistic, maybe.

3:19:09.800 --> 3:19:12.120
 That's what makes it fun, I think.

3:19:12.120 --> 3:19:13.960
 But then again, that's the Russian perspective.

3:19:13.960 --> 3:19:15.140
 I was just gonna say.

3:19:15.140 --> 3:19:18.840
 It is the Russian perspective.

3:19:18.840 --> 3:19:21.480
 That's what makes the Russian.

3:19:21.480 --> 3:19:24.120
 So Russian history, one day I'll do some Russian history.

3:19:24.120 --> 3:19:25.200
 I took it in college.

3:19:26.840 --> 3:19:28.600
 That's the ant farm, baby.

3:19:28.600 --> 3:19:31.160
 That's an ant farm with a very, very frustrated

3:19:31.160 --> 3:19:34.860
 young teenage alien kid.

3:19:35.920 --> 3:19:37.380
 Dan, I can't say.

3:19:37.380 --> 3:19:39.400
 I've already complimented you way too much.

3:19:39.400 --> 3:19:40.880
 I'm a huge fan.

3:19:40.880 --> 3:19:42.880
 This has been an incredible conversation.

3:19:42.880 --> 3:19:46.640
 It's a huge gift, your gift of humanity.

3:19:46.640 --> 3:19:47.480
 I hope you.

3:19:47.480 --> 3:19:49.160
 Oh, let me cut you off and just say

3:19:49.160 --> 3:19:50.920
 you've done a wonderful job.

3:19:50.920 --> 3:19:52.800
 This has been fun for me.

3:19:52.800 --> 3:19:54.340
 The questions, and more importantly,

3:19:54.340 --> 3:19:56.040
 the questions can come from anybody.

3:19:56.040 --> 3:19:58.620
 The counter statements, your responses have been wonderful.

3:19:58.620 --> 3:20:01.260
 You made this a very fun intellectual discussion for me.

3:20:01.260 --> 3:20:02.100
 Thank you.

3:20:02.100 --> 3:20:03.660
 Well, let me have the last word and say,

3:20:03.660 --> 3:20:08.280
 I agree with Elon and despite the doom caster say

3:20:08.280 --> 3:20:10.760
 that I think we've concluded definitively

3:20:10.760 --> 3:20:12.140
 and you don't get a chance to respond

3:20:12.140 --> 3:20:16.920
 that love is in fact the answer and the way forward.

3:20:16.920 --> 3:20:18.400
 So thanks so much, Dan.

3:20:18.400 --> 3:20:20.280
 Thank you for having me.
