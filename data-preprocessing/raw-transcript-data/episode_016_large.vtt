00:00.000 --> 00:03.520
 The following is a conversation with Eric Weinstein.

00:03.520 --> 00:08.820
 He's a mathematician, economist, physicist, and the managing director of Teal Capital.

00:08.820 --> 00:14.500
 He coined the term, and you can say, is the founder of the intellectual dark web, which

00:14.500 --> 00:19.920
 is a loosely assembled group of public intellectuals that includes Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson,

00:19.920 --> 00:24.920
 Steven Pinker, Joe Rogan, Michael Shermer, and a few others.

00:24.920 --> 00:30.340
 This conversation is part of the Artificial Intelligence Podcast at MIT and beyond.

00:30.340 --> 00:36.280
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex

00:36.280 --> 00:39.320
 Friedman, spelled F R I D.

00:39.320 --> 00:44.600
 And now, here's my conversation with Eric Weinstein.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.400
 Are you nervous about this?

00:46.400 --> 00:47.400
 Scared shitless.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.400
 Okay.

00:48.400 --> 00:54.660
 You mentioned Kung Fu Panda as one of your favorite movies.

00:54.660 --> 00:58.180
 It has the usual profound master student dynamic going on.

00:58.180 --> 01:04.080
 So who was, who has been a teacher that significantly influenced the direction of your thinking

01:04.080 --> 01:05.080
 and life's work?

01:05.080 --> 01:08.080
 So if you're the Kung Fu Panda, who was your Shifu?

01:08.080 --> 01:12.240
 Oh, well, it's interesting because I didn't see Shifu as being the teacher.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.240
 Who was the teacher?

01:13.240 --> 01:15.500
 Oogway, Master Oogway.

01:15.500 --> 01:16.500
 The turtle.

01:16.500 --> 01:17.500
 Oh, the turtle.

01:17.500 --> 01:18.500
 Right.

01:18.500 --> 01:21.260
 They only meet twice in the entire film.

01:21.260 --> 01:25.180
 And the first conversation sort of doesn't count.

01:25.180 --> 01:33.100
 So the magic of the film, in fact, its point is that the teaching that really matters is

01:33.100 --> 01:40.140
 transferred during a single conversation and it's very brief.

01:40.140 --> 01:42.660
 And so who played that role in my life?

01:42.660 --> 01:51.220
 I would say, uh, either, uh, my grandfather, uh, Harry Rubin and his wife, Sophie Rubin,

01:51.220 --> 01:54.300
 my grandmother, or Tom Lehrer.

01:54.300 --> 01:56.100
 Tom Lehrer?

01:56.100 --> 01:57.460
 Yeah.

01:57.460 --> 01:58.460
 In which way?

01:58.460 --> 02:05.380
 If you give a child Tom Lehrer records, what you do is you destroy their ability to be

02:05.380 --> 02:08.660
 taken over by later malware.

02:08.660 --> 02:17.420
 And it's so irreverent, so witty, so clever, so obscene that it destroys the ability to

02:17.420 --> 02:19.380
 lead a normal life for many people.

02:19.380 --> 02:27.060
 So if I meet somebody who's usually really shifted from any kind of neurotypical presentation,

02:27.060 --> 02:31.100
 I'll often ask them, uh, are you a Tom Lehrer fan?

02:31.100 --> 02:34.220
 And the odds that they will respond are quite high.

02:34.220 --> 02:38.280
 Tom Lehrer is, uh, poisoning pigeons in the park, Tom Lehrer.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.280
 That's very interesting.

02:39.280 --> 02:44.120
 There are a small number of Tom Lehrer songs that broke into the general population, poisoning

02:44.120 --> 02:48.140
 pigeons in the park, the element song, and perhaps the Vatican rag.

02:48.140 --> 02:53.180
 Uh, so when you meet somebody who knows those songs but doesn't know, oh, you're judging

02:53.180 --> 02:55.220
 me right now, aren't you?

02:55.220 --> 02:56.220
 Harshly.

02:56.220 --> 03:00.340
 Uh, no, but you're a Russian, so I doubt as the, you know, Nikolai Ivanovich Lubachevsky,

03:00.340 --> 03:01.340
 that song.

03:01.340 --> 03:02.340
 Yeah.

03:02.340 --> 03:06.100
 Um, so that was a song about plagiarism that was in fact plagiarized, which most people

03:06.100 --> 03:11.540
 don't know from Danny Kay, uh, where Danny Kay did a song called Stanislavsky of the

03:11.540 --> 03:13.340
 Muskie arts.

03:13.340 --> 03:19.120
 And so Tom Lehrer did this brilliant job of plagiarizing a song about and making it about

03:19.120 --> 03:24.860
 plagiarism and then making it about this mathematician who worked in non Euclidean geometry.

03:24.860 --> 03:27.580
 That was like, uh, giving heroin to a child.

03:27.580 --> 03:33.660
 It was extremely addictive and eventually led me to a lot of different places, one of

03:33.660 --> 03:36.620
 which may have been a PhD in mathematics.

03:36.620 --> 03:41.700
 And he was also at least a lecturer in mathematics, I believe at Harvard, something like that.

03:41.700 --> 03:42.700
 Yeah.

03:42.700 --> 03:43.700
 I just had dinner with him.

03:43.700 --> 03:51.740
 In fact, uh, when my son turned 13, we didn't tell him, but, um, his bar mitzvah present

03:51.740 --> 03:54.700
 was dinner with his hero, Tom Lehrer.

03:54.700 --> 04:01.020
 And Tom Lehrer was 88 years old, sharp as a tack, irreverent and funny as hell.

04:01.020 --> 04:05.860
 And just, you know, there are very few people in this world that you have to meet while

04:05.860 --> 04:07.020
 they're still here.

04:07.020 --> 04:09.420
 And that was definitely one for our family.

04:09.420 --> 04:16.700
 So that wit is a reflection of intelligence in some kind of deep way, like where that

04:16.700 --> 04:20.260
 would be a good test of intelligence, whether you're a Tom Lehrer fan.

04:20.260 --> 04:27.500
 So what do you think that is about wit, about that kind of humor, ability to see the absurdity

04:27.500 --> 04:28.500
 in existence?

04:28.500 --> 04:33.540
 Well, do you think that's connected to intelligence or are we just two Jews on a mic that appreciate

04:33.540 --> 04:34.540
 that kind of humor?

04:34.540 --> 04:37.580
 No, I think that it's absolutely connected to intelligence.

04:37.580 --> 04:40.140
 So you can, you can see it.

04:40.140 --> 04:45.260
 There's a place where Tom Lehrer decides that he's going to lampoon Gilbert of Gilbert and

04:45.260 --> 04:49.540
 Sullivan and he's going to outdo Gilbert with clever, meaningless wordplay.

04:49.540 --> 04:55.540
 And he has, forget the, well, let's see, he's doing Clementine as if Gilbert and Sullivan

04:55.540 --> 04:56.540
 wrote it.

04:56.540 --> 05:00.540
 That I misunderstood depressed her young sister named Mr. This Mr. Depester, she tried pestering

05:00.540 --> 05:04.940
 sisters of festering blister you best to resist or say I, the sister persisted the Mr. Resisted

05:04.940 --> 05:07.900
 I kissed her all loyalty slip when he said, when she said I could have her, her sister's

05:07.900 --> 05:10.860
 cadaver must surely have turned in its crypt.

05:10.860 --> 05:11.980
 That's so dense.

05:11.980 --> 05:19.180
 It's so insane that that's clearly intelligence because it's hard to construct something like

05:19.180 --> 05:20.180
 that.

05:20.180 --> 05:26.380
 If I look at my favorite Tom Lehrer, Tom Lehrer lyric, you know, there's a perfectly absurd

05:26.380 --> 05:30.300
 one, which is once all the Germans were warlike and mean, but that couldn't happen again.

05:30.300 --> 05:34.740
 We taught them a lesson in 1918 and they've hardly bothered us since then, right?

05:34.740 --> 05:36.900
 That is a different kind of intelligence.

05:36.900 --> 05:41.780
 You know, you're taking something that is so horrific and you're, you're sort of making

05:41.780 --> 05:47.780
 it palatable and funny and demonstrating also, um, just your humanity.

05:47.780 --> 05:53.660
 I mean, I think the thing that came through as, as Tom Lehrer wrote all of these terrible,

05:53.660 --> 05:59.340
 horrible lines was just what a sensitive and beautiful soul he was, who was channeling

05:59.340 --> 06:02.820
 pain through humor and through grace.

06:02.820 --> 06:07.900
 I've seen throughout Europe, throughout Russia, that same kind of humor emerged from the generation

06:07.900 --> 06:09.260
 of world war II.

06:09.260 --> 06:14.660
 It seemed like that humor is required to somehow deal with the pain and the suffering of that,

06:14.660 --> 06:16.700
 that war created.

06:16.700 --> 06:19.700
 You do need the environment to create the broad Slavic soul.

06:19.700 --> 06:30.780
 I don't think that many Americans really appreciate, um, Russian humor, how you had to joke during

06:30.780 --> 06:35.700
 the time of, let's say article 58 under Stalin, you had to be very, very careful.

06:35.700 --> 06:40.500
 You know, the concept of a Russian satirical magazine like Crocodile, uh, doesn't make

06:40.500 --> 06:41.500
 sense.

06:41.500 --> 06:48.680
 So you have this cross cultural problem that there are certain areas of human experience

06:48.680 --> 06:51.420
 that it would be better to know nothing about.

06:51.420 --> 06:56.780
 And quite unfortunately, Eastern Europe knows a great deal about them, which makes the,

06:56.780 --> 07:02.940
 you know, the songs of Vladimir Vysotsky so potent, the, uh, you know, the pros of Pushkin,

07:02.940 --> 07:09.020
 whatever it is, uh, you have to appreciate the depth of the Eastern European experience.

07:09.020 --> 07:14.160
 And I would think that perhaps Americans knew something like this around the time of the

07:14.160 --> 07:22.580
 civil war or merit maybe, um, you know, under slavery and Jim Crow or even the, uh, harsh

07:22.580 --> 07:28.500
 tyranny of, uh, the coal and steel employers during the labor wars.

07:28.500 --> 07:34.940
 Um, but in general, I would say it's hard for us to understand and imagine the collective

07:34.940 --> 07:40.660
 culture unless we have the system of selective pressures that, for example, uh, Russians

07:40.660 --> 07:41.660
 were subjected to.

07:41.660 --> 07:49.820
 Yeah, so if there's one good thing that comes out of war, it's literature, art, and humor

07:49.820 --> 07:50.820
 and music.

07:50.820 --> 07:52.380
 Oh, I don't think so.

07:52.380 --> 07:57.660
 I think almost everything is good about war except for death and destruction.

07:57.660 --> 07:59.380
 Right.

07:59.380 --> 08:02.720
 Without the death, it would bring, uh, the romance of it.

08:02.720 --> 08:03.720
 The whole thing is nice.

08:03.720 --> 08:07.900
 Well, this is why we're always caught up in war and we have this very ambiguous relationship

08:07.900 --> 08:15.820
 to it is that it makes life real and pressing and meaningful and at an unacceptable price

08:15.820 --> 08:17.820
 and the price has never been higher.

08:17.820 --> 08:22.860
 So just jump in, uh, into AI a little bit.

08:22.860 --> 08:28.740
 You, uh, in one of the conversations you had or one of the videos, you described that one

08:28.740 --> 08:34.480
 of the things AI systems can't do and biological systems can is self replicate in the physical

08:34.480 --> 08:35.480
 world.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.400
 Oh no, no.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.700
 In the physical world.

08:38.700 --> 08:45.020
 Well, yes, the physical robots can't self replicate, but the fit, but you, this is a

08:45.020 --> 08:50.940
 very tricky point, which is that the only thing that we've been able to create that's

08:50.940 --> 08:57.440
 really complex that has an analog of our reproductive system is software.

08:57.440 --> 09:01.220
 But nevertheless, software replicates itself.

09:01.220 --> 09:05.820
 Uh, if we're speaking strictly for the replication in this kind of digital space.

09:05.820 --> 09:08.700
 So let me just to begin, let me ask a question.

09:08.700 --> 09:15.140
 Do you see a protective barrier or a gap between the physical world and the digital world?

09:15.140 --> 09:16.580
 Let's not call it digital.

09:16.580 --> 09:20.900
 Let's call it the logical world versus the physical world.

09:20.900 --> 09:21.900
 Why logical?

09:21.900 --> 09:28.080
 Well, because even though we had, let's say Einstein's brain preserved, uh, it was meaningless

09:28.080 --> 09:33.720
 to us as a physical object because we couldn't do anything with what was stored in it at

09:33.720 --> 09:35.660
 a logical level.

09:35.660 --> 09:40.380
 And so the idea that something may be stored logically and that it may be stored physically,

09:40.380 --> 09:45.740
 uh, are not necessarily, uh, we don't always benefit from synonymizing.

09:45.740 --> 09:51.060
 I'm not suggesting that there isn't a material basis to the logical world, but that it does

09:51.060 --> 09:58.260
 warrant identification with a separate layer that need not invoke logic gates and zeros

09:58.260 --> 09:59.700
 and ones.

09:59.700 --> 10:03.660
 And uh, so connecting those two worlds, the logical world and the physical world, or maybe

10:03.660 --> 10:09.380
 just connecting to the logical world inside our brain, Einstein's brain.

10:09.380 --> 10:14.740
 You mentioned the idea of out, outtelligence.

10:14.740 --> 10:15.960
 Artificial outtelligence.

10:15.960 --> 10:16.960
 Artificial outtelligence.

10:16.960 --> 10:17.960
 Yes.

10:17.960 --> 10:22.660
 This is the only essay that John Brockman ever invited me to write that he refused to

10:22.660 --> 10:24.660
 publish in Edge.

10:24.660 --> 10:25.660
 Why?

10:25.660 --> 10:30.660
 Well, maybe it wasn't, it wasn't well written, um, but I don't know.

10:30.660 --> 10:36.820
 The idea is quite compelling is quite unique and new and at least from my view of a stance

10:36.820 --> 10:38.700
 point, maybe you can explain it.

10:38.700 --> 10:39.700
 Sure.

10:39.700 --> 10:45.360
 What I was thinking about is why it is that we're waiting to be terrified by artificial

10:45.360 --> 10:53.480
 general intelligence when in fact, artificial life, uh, is terrifying in and of itself and

10:53.480 --> 10:54.620
 it's already here.

10:54.620 --> 11:00.280
 So in order to have a system of selective pressures, you need three distinct elements.

11:00.280 --> 11:04.400
 You need variation within a population.

11:04.400 --> 11:08.580
 You need heritability and you need differential success.

11:08.580 --> 11:16.140
 So what's really unique and I've made this point, I think elsewhere about software is

11:16.140 --> 11:19.380
 that if you think about what humans know how to build, that's impressive.

11:19.380 --> 11:25.340
 So I always take a car and I say, does it have an analog of each of the physical physiological

11:25.340 --> 11:26.340
 systems?

11:26.340 --> 11:27.340
 Does it have a skeletal structure?

11:27.340 --> 11:28.340
 That's its frame.

11:28.340 --> 11:30.380
 Does it have a neurological structure?

11:30.380 --> 11:35.740
 Has an on board computer, has a digestive system.

11:35.740 --> 11:38.520
 The one thing it doesn't have is a reproductive system.

11:38.520 --> 11:47.460
 But if you can call spawn on a process, effectively you do have a reproductive system and that

11:47.460 --> 11:53.460
 means that you can create something with variation, heritability and differential success.

11:53.460 --> 12:01.420
 Now the next step in the chain of thinking was where do we see inanimate, non intelligent

12:01.420 --> 12:05.700
 life outwitting intelligent life?

12:05.700 --> 12:11.500
 And um, I have two favorite systems and I try to stay on them so that we don't get distracted.

12:11.500 --> 12:16.980
 One of which is the Ofres orchid, um, subspecies or subclade.

12:16.980 --> 12:17.980
 I don't know what to call it.

12:17.980 --> 12:18.980
 There's a type of flower.

12:18.980 --> 12:23.940
 Yeah, it's a type of flower that mimics the female of a pollinator species in order to

12:23.940 --> 12:27.460
 dupe the males into, uh, engaging.

12:27.460 --> 12:31.980
 It was called pseudo copulation with the fake female, which is usually represented by the

12:31.980 --> 12:34.040
 lowest pedal.

12:34.040 --> 12:37.420
 And there's also a pheromone component to fool the males into thinking they have a mating

12:37.420 --> 12:38.420
 opportunity.

12:38.420 --> 12:42.820
 But the flower doesn't have to give up energy energy in the form of nectar as a lure because

12:42.820 --> 12:45.320
 it's tricking the males.

12:45.320 --> 12:53.660
 The other system is a particular species, uh, of muscle lampicillus in the clear streams

12:53.660 --> 13:02.060
 of Missouri and it fools bass into biting a fleshy lip that contain its young.

13:02.060 --> 13:07.100
 And when the bass see this fleshy lip, which looks exactly like a species of fish that

13:07.100 --> 13:13.420
 the bass like to eat, the, uh, the young explode and clamp onto the gills and parasitize the

13:13.420 --> 13:20.860
 bass and also lose the best redistribute them as they eventually release both of these systems.

13:20.860 --> 13:31.700
 You have a highly intelligent dupe being fooled by a lower life form and what is sculpting

13:31.700 --> 13:34.780
 these, these convincing lures.

13:34.780 --> 13:41.540
 It's the intelligence of previously duped targets for these strategies.

13:41.540 --> 13:48.980
 So when the target is smart enough to avoid the strategy, uh, those weaker mimics, uh,

13:48.980 --> 13:49.980
 fall off.

13:49.980 --> 13:52.780
 They have terminal lines and only the better ones survive.

13:52.780 --> 14:00.820
 So it's an arms race between the target species, uh, that is being parasitized, getting smarter

14:00.820 --> 14:09.000
 and this other less intelligent or non intelligent object getting as if smarter.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.700
 And so what you see is, is that artificial intelligence, artificial general intelligence

14:13.700 --> 14:17.260
 is not needed to parasitize us.

14:17.260 --> 14:22.120
 It's simply sufficient for us to outwit ourselves.

14:22.120 --> 14:27.100
 So you could have a program, let's say, you know, one of these Nigerian scams, um, that

14:27.100 --> 14:36.060
 writes letters and uses whoever sends it Bitcoin, uh, to figure out which aspects of the program

14:36.060 --> 14:38.900
 should be kept, which should be varied and thrown away.

14:38.900 --> 14:43.340
 And you don't need it to be in any way intelligent in order to have a really nightmarish scenario

14:43.340 --> 14:46.740
 of being parasitized by something that has no idea what it's doing.

14:46.740 --> 14:49.400
 So you, you, you phrased a few concepts really eloquently.

14:49.400 --> 14:53.060
 So let me try to, uh, as a few directions this goes.

14:53.060 --> 14:58.180
 So one first, first of all, in the way we write software today, it's not common that

14:58.180 --> 15:01.180
 we allow it to self modify.

15:01.180 --> 15:02.180
 But we do have that ability.

15:02.180 --> 15:05.220
 Now we have the ability, it's just not common.

15:05.220 --> 15:06.220
 It's not just common.

15:06.220 --> 15:13.100
 So, so your, your thought is that that is a serious worry.

15:13.100 --> 15:15.400
 If there becomes, uh,

15:15.400 --> 15:18.540
 Self modifying code is, is available now.

15:18.540 --> 15:21.220
 So there's, there's different types of self modification, right?

15:21.220 --> 15:28.500
 There's a personalization, you know, your email app, your Gmail is a self modifying

15:28.500 --> 15:32.420
 to you after you log in or whatever you can think of it that way.

15:32.420 --> 15:39.620
 But ultimately it's central, all the information is centralized, but you're thinking of ideas

15:39.620 --> 15:45.460
 where you're completely, so this is an unique entity, uh, operating under selective pressures

15:45.460 --> 15:46.460
 and it changes.

15:46.460 --> 15:52.520
 Well, you just, if you think about the fact that our immune systems, uh, don't know what's

15:52.520 --> 15:58.740
 coming at them next, but they have a small set of spanning components and if it's, if

15:58.740 --> 16:06.660
 it's a sufficiently expressive system in that any shape, uh, or binding region can be approximated,

16:06.660 --> 16:13.100
 uh, with, with the Lego that is present, um, then you can have confidence that you don't

16:13.100 --> 16:20.580
 need to know what's coming at you because the combinatorics, um, are sufficient to reach

16:20.580 --> 16:22.660
 any configuration needed.

16:22.660 --> 16:25.380
 Uh, so that's a beautiful thing.

16:25.380 --> 16:30.700
 Well, terrifying thing to worry about because it's so within our reach.

16:30.700 --> 16:34.140
 Whatever I suggest these things, I do always have a concern as to whether or not I will

16:34.140 --> 16:37.020
 bring them into being by talking about them.

16:37.020 --> 16:43.300
 So, uh, there's this thing from open AI, uh, next, next week to talk to the founder of

16:43.300 --> 16:50.060
 open AI, uh, this idea that, uh, their text generation, the new, uh, the new stuff they

16:50.060 --> 16:54.400
 have for generating texts is they didn't want to bring it, they didn't want to release it

16:54.400 --> 16:57.420
 because they're worried about the.

16:57.420 --> 17:00.660
 I'm delighted to hear that, but they're going to end up releasing.

17:00.660 --> 17:01.660
 Yes.

17:01.660 --> 17:06.160
 So that's the thing is I think talking about it, um, well, at least from my end, I'm more

17:06.160 --> 17:14.100
 a proponent of technology preventing tech, uh, so further innovation, preventing the

17:14.100 --> 17:16.100
 detrimental effects of innovation.

17:16.100 --> 17:22.300
 Well, we're at a, we're sort of tumbling down a hill at accelerating speed.

17:22.300 --> 17:27.020
 So whether or not we're proponents or it doesn't, it doesn't really, it may not matter, but

17:27.020 --> 17:33.580
 I, well, I do feel that there are people who've held things back and, uh, you know, died poor

17:33.580 --> 17:35.380
 than they might've otherwise been.

17:35.380 --> 17:37.380
 We don't even know their names.

17:37.380 --> 17:43.740
 I don't think that we should discount the idea that having the smartest people showing

17:43.740 --> 17:50.820
 off how smart they are by what they've developed may be a terminal process.

17:50.820 --> 17:57.240
 I'm very mindful in particular of a beautiful letter that Edward Teller of all people wrote

17:57.240 --> 18:02.060
 to Leo Zillard and where Zillard was trying to figure out how to control the use of atomic

18:02.060 --> 18:08.020
 weaponry at the end of world war II and teller rather strangely because many of us view him

18:08.020 --> 18:15.060
 as a monster, um, showed some, a very advanced moral thinking talking about the slim chance

18:15.060 --> 18:19.100
 we have for survival and that the only hope is to make Warren thinkable.

18:19.100 --> 18:24.900
 I do think that not enough of us feel in our gut what it is we are playing with when we

18:24.900 --> 18:26.660
 are working on technical problems.

18:26.660 --> 18:31.500
 And I would recommend to anyone who hasn't seen it, a movie called the bridge over the

18:31.500 --> 18:38.260
 bridge on the river Kwai about, I believe captured British POWs who just in a desire

18:38.260 --> 18:43.180
 to do a bridge well, end up over collaborating with their Japanese captors.

18:43.180 --> 18:51.100
 Well now you're making me a question the unrestricted open discussion of ideas and AI.

18:51.100 --> 18:55.980
 I'm not saying I know the answer, I'm just saying that I could make a decent case for

18:55.980 --> 19:00.020
 either our need to talk about this and to become technologically focused on containing

19:00.020 --> 19:06.840
 it or need to stop talking about this and try to hope that the relatively small number

19:06.840 --> 19:11.100
 of highly adept individuals who are looking at these problems is small enough that we

19:11.100 --> 19:14.060
 should in fact be talking about how to contain them.

19:14.060 --> 19:20.380
 Well the way ideas, the way innovation happens, what new ideas develop, Newton with calculus,

19:20.380 --> 19:26.940
 whether if he was silent, the idea would be, would emerge elsewhere in the case of Newton

19:26.940 --> 19:27.940
 of course.

19:27.940 --> 19:34.980
 But in the case of AI, how small is the set of individuals out of which such ideas would

19:34.980 --> 19:35.980
 arise?

19:35.980 --> 19:42.060
 Well the idea is that the researchers we know and those that we don't know who may live

19:42.060 --> 19:47.100
 in countries that don't wish us to know what level they're currently at are very disciplined

19:47.100 --> 19:50.540
 in keeping these things to themselves.

19:50.540 --> 19:57.180
 Of course I will point out that there's a religious school in Kerala that developed

19:57.180 --> 20:05.980
 something very close to the calculus, certainly in terms of infinite series in I guess religious

20:05.980 --> 20:10.420
 prayer and rhyme and prose.

20:10.420 --> 20:16.300
 So it's not that Newton had any ability to hold that back and I don't really believe

20:16.300 --> 20:17.580
 that we have an ability to hold it back.

20:17.580 --> 20:23.020
 I do think that we could change the proportion of the time we spend worrying about the effects

20:23.020 --> 20:26.420
 of what if we are successful rather than simply trying to succeed and hope that we'll be able

20:26.420 --> 20:27.900
 to contain things later.

20:27.900 --> 20:29.300
 Beautifully put.

20:29.300 --> 20:35.660
 So on the idea of intelligence, what form, treading cautiously as we've agreed as we

20:35.660 --> 20:38.060
 tumbled down the hill, what form...

20:38.060 --> 20:39.620
 We can't stop ourselves, can we?

20:39.620 --> 20:42.000
 We cannot.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.540
 What form do you see it taking?

20:43.540 --> 20:52.040
 So one example, Facebook, Google, do want to, I don't know a better word, you want to

20:52.040 --> 20:59.580
 influence users to behave a certain way and so that's one kind of example of how intelligence

20:59.580 --> 21:05.940
 is systems perhaps modifying the behavior of these intelligent human beings in order

21:05.940 --> 21:08.460
 to sell more product of different kinds.

21:08.460 --> 21:13.060
 But do you see other examples of this actually emerging in...

21:13.060 --> 21:18.680
 Just take any parasitic system, make sure that there's some way in which that there's

21:18.680 --> 21:25.180
 differential success, heritability, and variation.

21:25.180 --> 21:29.380
 And those are the magic ingredients and if you really wanted to build a nightmare machine,

21:29.380 --> 21:36.780
 make sure that the system that expresses the variability has a spanning set so that it

21:36.780 --> 21:41.920
 can learn to arbitrary levels by making it sufficiently expressive.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.240
 That's your nightmare.

21:43.240 --> 21:49.060
 So it's your nightmare, but it could also be, it's a really powerful mechanism by which

21:49.060 --> 21:52.360
 to create, well, powerful systems.

21:52.360 --> 21:59.100
 So are you more worried about the negative direction that might go versus the positive?

21:59.100 --> 22:05.140
 So you said parasitic, but that doesn't necessarily need to be what the system converges towards.

22:05.140 --> 22:07.780
 It could be, what is it?

22:07.780 --> 22:13.700
 And the dividing line between parasitism and symbiosis is not so clear.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.060
 That's what they tell me about marriage.

22:15.060 --> 22:17.540
 I'm still single, so I don't know.

22:17.540 --> 22:27.580
 Well yeah, we could go into that too, but no, I think we have to appreciate, are you

22:27.580 --> 22:30.660
 infected by your own mitochondria?

22:30.660 --> 22:31.660
 Right.

22:31.660 --> 22:32.660
 Right?

22:32.660 --> 22:33.660
 Yeah.

22:33.660 --> 22:42.580
 So in marriage, you fear the loss of independence, but even though the American therapeutic community

22:42.580 --> 22:47.420
 may be very concerned about codependence, what's to say that codependence isn't what's

22:47.420 --> 22:52.780
 necessary to have a stable relationship in which to raise children who are maximally

22:52.780 --> 22:57.260
 case selected and require incredible amounts of care because you have to wait 13 years

22:57.260 --> 23:00.700
 before there's any reproductive payout and most of us don't want our 13 year olds having

23:00.700 --> 23:01.700
 kids.

23:01.700 --> 23:08.940
 That's a very tricky situation to analyze and I would say that predators and parasites

23:08.940 --> 23:14.020
 drive much of our evolution and I don't know whether to be angry at them or thank them.

23:14.020 --> 23:19.620
 Well ultimately, I mean nobody knows the meaning of life or what even happiness is, but there

23:19.620 --> 23:20.620
 is some metrics.

23:20.620 --> 23:21.620
 They didn't tell you?

23:21.620 --> 23:22.620
 They didn't.

23:22.620 --> 23:23.620
 They didn't.

23:23.620 --> 23:29.460
 That's why all the poetry and books are about, you know, there's some metrics under which

23:29.460 --> 23:35.060
 you can kind of measure how good it is that these AI systems are roaming about.

23:35.060 --> 23:44.380
 So you're more nervous about software than you are optimistic about ideas of, yeah, self

23:44.380 --> 23:45.380
 replicating largely.

23:45.380 --> 23:50.420
 I don't think we've really felt where we are.

23:50.420 --> 23:57.660
 You know, occasionally we get a wake up, 9 11 was so anomalous compared to everything

23:57.660 --> 24:03.540
 else we've experienced on American soil that it came to us as a complete shock that that

24:03.540 --> 24:05.060
 was even a possibility.

24:05.060 --> 24:11.620
 What it really was was a highly creative and determined R and D team deep in the bowels

24:11.620 --> 24:18.200
 of Afghanistan showing us that we had certain exploits that we were open to that nobody

24:18.200 --> 24:19.380
 had chosen to express.

24:19.380 --> 24:23.700
 I can think of several of these things that I don't talk about publicly that just seem

24:23.700 --> 24:32.140
 to have to do with, um, how relatively unimaginative those who wish to cause havoc and destruction

24:32.140 --> 24:33.860
 have been up until now.

24:33.860 --> 24:43.780
 But the great mystery of our time of this particular little era is how remarkably stable

24:43.780 --> 24:50.780
 we've been since 1945 when we demonstrated the ability to use a nuclear weapons in anger.

24:50.780 --> 24:58.440
 And we don't know why things like that haven't happened since then.

24:58.440 --> 25:03.780
 We've had several close calls, we've had mistakes, we've had a brinksmanship.

25:03.780 --> 25:09.820
 And what's now happened is that we've settled into a sense that, Oh, it's, it'll always

25:09.820 --> 25:10.820
 be nothing.

25:10.820 --> 25:20.260
 It's been so long since something was at that level of danger that we've got a wrong idea

25:20.260 --> 25:21.260
 in our head.

25:21.260 --> 25:25.500
 And that's why when I went on the Ben Shapiro show, I talked about the need to resume above

25:25.500 --> 25:30.460
 ground testing of nuclear devices because we have people whose developmental experience

25:30.460 --> 25:37.580
 suggests that when let's say Donald Trump and North Korea engage on Twitter, Oh, it's

25:37.580 --> 25:38.580
 nothing.

25:38.580 --> 25:39.580
 It's just posturing.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.140
 Everybody's just in it for money.

25:41.140 --> 25:46.860
 There's, there's an, a sense that people are in a video game mode, which has been the right

25:46.860 --> 25:49.500
 call since 1945.

25:49.500 --> 25:51.140
 We've been mostly in video game mode.

25:51.140 --> 25:52.140
 It's amazing.

25:52.140 --> 25:57.140
 So you're worried about a generation which has not seen any existential.

25:57.140 --> 25:58.300
 We've lived under it.

25:58.300 --> 26:00.260
 You see, you're younger.

26:00.260 --> 26:05.860
 I don't know if, if, and again, you came from, from Moscow.

26:05.860 --> 26:13.540
 There was a TV show called the day after that had a huge effect on a generation growing

26:13.540 --> 26:21.020
 up in the U S and it talked about what life would be like after a nuclear exchange.

26:21.020 --> 26:27.500
 We have not gone through an embodied experience collectively where we've thought about this.

26:27.500 --> 26:32.780
 And I think it's one of the most irresponsible things that the elders among us have done,

26:32.780 --> 26:41.820
 which is to provide this beautiful garden in which the thorns are cut off of the, of

26:41.820 --> 26:47.860
 the Rose bushes and all of the edges are rounded and sanded.

26:47.860 --> 26:52.140
 And so people have developed this, this totally unreal idea, which is everything's going to

26:52.140 --> 26:54.240
 be just fine.

26:54.240 --> 27:01.180
 And do I think that my leading concern is AGI or my leading concern is a thermonuclear

27:01.180 --> 27:04.060
 exchange or gene drives or any one of these things?

27:04.060 --> 27:11.780
 I don't know, but I know that our time here in this very long experiment here is finite

27:11.780 --> 27:19.340
 because the toys that we've built are so impressive and the wisdom to accompany them has not materialized.

27:19.340 --> 27:24.300
 And I think it's, we actually got a wisdom uptick since 1945.

27:24.300 --> 27:29.980
 We had a lot of dangerous skilled players on the world stage who nevertheless, no matter

27:29.980 --> 27:38.140
 how bad they were managed to not embroil us in something that we couldn't come back from

27:38.140 --> 27:39.140
 the cold war.

27:39.140 --> 27:46.660
 Yeah, and the distance from the cold war, you know, I'm very mindful of a, there was

27:46.660 --> 27:54.980
 a Russian tradition actually of on your wedding day, going to visit a memorial to those who

27:54.980 --> 27:55.980
 gave their lives.

27:55.980 --> 28:02.800
 Can you imagine this where you, on the happiest day of your life, you go and you pay homage

28:02.800 --> 28:08.980
 to the people who fought and died in the battle of Stalingrad.

28:08.980 --> 28:13.460
 I'm not a huge fan of communism, I got to say, but there were a couple of things that

28:13.460 --> 28:18.860
 the Russians did that were really positive in the Soviet era.

28:18.860 --> 28:25.060
 And I think trying to let people know how serious life actually is, is the Russian model

28:25.060 --> 28:28.660
 of seriousness is better than the American model.

28:28.660 --> 28:34.340
 And maybe like you mentioned, there was a small echo of that after 9 11.

28:34.340 --> 28:36.180
 But we wouldn't let it form.

28:36.180 --> 28:42.860
 We talk about 9 11, but it's 9 12 that really moved the needle when we were all just there

28:42.860 --> 28:46.140
 and nobody wanted to speak.

28:46.140 --> 28:55.580
 We witnessed something super serious and we didn't want to run to our computers and blast

28:55.580 --> 28:59.260
 out our deep thoughts and our feelings.

28:59.260 --> 29:05.740
 And it was profound because we woke up briefly, you know, I talk about the gated institutional

29:05.740 --> 29:08.980
 narrative that sort of programs our lives.

29:08.980 --> 29:15.260
 I've seen it break three times in my life, one of which was the election of Donald Trump.

29:15.260 --> 29:21.300
 Another time was the fall of Lehman Brothers when everybody who knew that Bear Stearns

29:21.300 --> 29:27.380
 wasn't that important knew that Lehman Brothers met AIG was next.

29:27.380 --> 29:29.460
 And the other one was 9 11.

29:29.460 --> 29:35.260
 And so if I'm 53 years old and I only remember three times that the global narrative was

29:35.260 --> 29:42.980
 really interrupted, that tells you how much we've been on top of developing events.

29:42.980 --> 29:46.580
 You know, I mean we had the Murrow federal building explosion, but it didn't cause the

29:46.580 --> 29:47.580
 narrative to break.

29:47.580 --> 29:49.580
 It wasn't profound enough.

29:49.580 --> 29:58.820
 Around 9 12 we started to wake up out of our slumber and the powers that be did not want

29:58.820 --> 29:59.820
 to coming together.

29:59.820 --> 30:03.780
 They, you know, the admonition was go shopping.

30:03.780 --> 30:07.820
 And the powers that be was what is that force as opposed to blaming individuals?

30:07.820 --> 30:08.920
 We don't know.

30:08.920 --> 30:13.460
 So whatever that, whatever that force is, there's a component of it that's emergent

30:13.460 --> 30:15.780
 and there's a component of it that's deliberate.

30:15.780 --> 30:18.840
 So give yourself a portfolio with two components.

30:18.840 --> 30:23.900
 Some amount of it is emergent, but some amount of it is also an understanding that if people

30:23.900 --> 30:27.880
 come together, they become an incredible force.

30:27.880 --> 30:34.660
 And what you're seeing right now I think is there are forces that are trying to come together

30:34.660 --> 30:39.500
 and there are forces that are trying to push things apart.

30:39.500 --> 30:43.540
 And you know, one of them is the globalist narrative versus the national narrative where

30:43.540 --> 30:50.080
 to the global, uh, globalist perspective, uh, the nation nations are bad things in essence

30:50.080 --> 30:56.300
 that they're temporary, they're nationalistic, they're jingoistic, it's all negative to people

30:56.300 --> 30:59.420
 in the national, more in the national idiom, they're saying, look, this is where I pay

30:59.420 --> 31:00.420
 my taxes.

31:00.420 --> 31:02.660
 This is where I do my army service.

31:02.660 --> 31:04.340
 This is where I have a vote.

31:04.340 --> 31:06.180
 This is where I have a passport.

31:06.180 --> 31:10.220
 Who the hell are you to tell me that because you've moved into someplace that you can make

31:10.220 --> 31:15.580
 money globally, that you've chosen to abandon other people to whom you have a special and

31:15.580 --> 31:16.580
 elevated duty.

31:16.580 --> 31:22.140
 And I think that these competing narratives have been pushing towards the global perspective,

31:22.140 --> 31:27.660
 uh, from the elite and a larger and larger number of disenfranchised people are saying,

31:27.660 --> 31:32.060
 hey, I actually live in a, in a place and I have laws and I speak a language, I have

31:32.060 --> 31:33.660
 a culture.

31:33.660 --> 31:40.300
 And who are you to tell me that because you can profit in some far away land that my obligations

31:40.300 --> 31:43.260
 to my fellow countrymen are so, so much diminished.

31:43.260 --> 31:47.940
 So these tensions between nations and so on, ultimately you see being proud of your country

31:47.940 --> 31:53.700
 and so on, which creates potentially the kind of things that led to wars and so on.

31:53.700 --> 31:58.420
 They, they ultimately, it is human nature and it is good for us for wake up calls of

31:58.420 --> 31:59.420
 different kinds.

31:59.420 --> 32:05.020
 Well, I think that these are tensions and my point isn't, I mean, nationalism run amok

32:05.020 --> 32:09.980
 is a nightmare and internationalism run amok is a nightmare.

32:09.980 --> 32:16.820
 And the problem is we're trying to push these pendulums, uh, to some place where they're

32:16.820 --> 32:24.260
 somewhat balanced, where we, we have a higher duty of care to those, uh, who share our log,

32:24.260 --> 32:30.940
 our laws and our citizenship, but we don't forget our duties of care to the global system.

32:30.940 --> 32:37.660
 I would think this is elementary, but the problem that we're facing concerns the ability

32:37.660 --> 32:45.540
 for some to profit at the, by abandoning their obligations, uh, to others within their system.

32:45.540 --> 32:48.580
 And that's what we've had for decades.

32:48.580 --> 32:50.220
 You mentioned nuclear weapons.

32:50.220 --> 32:55.860
 I was hoping to get answers from you since one of the many things you've done as a economics

32:55.860 --> 33:00.500
 and maybe you can understand human behavior of why the heck we haven't blown each other

33:00.500 --> 33:01.500
 up yet.

33:01.500 --> 33:02.500
 But okay.

33:02.500 --> 33:03.500
 So, uh, we'll get back.

33:03.500 --> 33:04.500
 I don't know the answer.

33:04.500 --> 33:05.500
 Yes.

33:05.500 --> 33:06.500
 It's a, it's a fast.

33:06.500 --> 33:07.500
 It's really important to say that we really don't know.

33:07.500 --> 33:09.500
 A mild uptick in wisdom.

33:09.500 --> 33:10.820
 A mild uptick in wisdom.

33:10.820 --> 33:17.300
 Well, Steven Pinker, who I've talked with has a lot of really good ideas about why,

33:17.300 --> 33:20.060
 but I don't trust his optimism.

33:20.060 --> 33:24.860
 Listen, I'm Russian, so I never trust a guy who was that optimistic.

33:24.860 --> 33:25.860
 No, no, no.

33:25.860 --> 33:31.260
 It's just that you're talking about a guy who's looking at a system in which more and

33:31.260 --> 33:37.740
 more of the kinetic energy like war has been turned into potential energy, like unused

33:37.740 --> 33:38.740
 nuclear weapons.

33:38.740 --> 33:39.740
 Beautifully put.

33:39.740 --> 33:42.900
 You know, now I'm looking at that system and I'm saying, okay, well, if you don't have

33:42.900 --> 33:46.060
 a potential energy term, then everything's just getting better and better.

33:46.060 --> 33:47.060
 Yeah.

33:47.060 --> 33:48.060
 Wow.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.060
 That's beautifully put.

33:49.060 --> 33:50.060
 Only a physicist could.

33:50.060 --> 33:51.060
 Okay.

33:51.060 --> 33:52.060
 I'm not a physicist.

33:52.060 --> 33:55.060
 Is that a dirty word?

33:55.060 --> 33:56.060
 No, no.

33:56.060 --> 33:57.060
 I wish I were a physicist.

33:57.060 --> 33:58.060
 Me too.

33:58.060 --> 33:59.060
 My dad's a physicist.

33:59.060 --> 34:02.900
 I'm trying to live up that probably for the rest of my life.

34:02.900 --> 34:04.500
 He's probably gonna listen to this too.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.500
 So.

34:05.500 --> 34:06.500
 He did.

34:06.500 --> 34:07.500
 Yeah.

34:07.500 --> 34:13.940
 So your friend, Sam Harris, uh, worries a lot about the existential threat of AI.

34:13.940 --> 34:18.060
 Not in the way that you've described, but in the more, well, he hangs out with Elon.

34:18.060 --> 34:20.380
 I don't know Elon.

34:20.380 --> 34:30.020
 So are you worried about that kind of, uh, you know, about the, um, about either robotic

34:30.020 --> 34:35.660
 systems or, you know, traditionally defined AI systems essentially becoming a super intelligent,

34:35.660 --> 34:40.700
 much more intelligent than human beings and, uh, getting, well, they already are and they're

34:40.700 --> 34:47.420
 not when, when seen as a, um, a collective, you mean, well, I mean, I, I can mean all

34:47.420 --> 34:54.420
 sorts of things, but certainly many of the things that we thought were peculiar to general

34:54.420 --> 34:57.340
 intelligence or do not require general intelligence.

34:57.340 --> 35:04.160
 So that's been one of the big awakenings that you can write a pretty convincing sports story

35:04.160 --> 35:10.700
 from stats alone, uh, without needing to have watched the game.

35:10.700 --> 35:13.900
 So you know, is it possible to write lively pros about politics?

35:13.900 --> 35:17.580
 Yeah, no, not yet.

35:17.580 --> 35:20.480
 So we were sort of all over the map.

35:20.480 --> 35:24.020
 One of the, one of the things about chess that you'll, there's a question I once asked

35:24.020 --> 35:29.220
 on Quora that didn't get a lot of response, which was what is the greatest brilliancy

35:29.220 --> 35:32.860
 ever produced by a computer in a chess game, which was different than the question of what

35:32.860 --> 35:35.540
 is the greatest game ever played.

35:35.540 --> 35:39.180
 So if you think about brilliancies is what really animates many of us to think of chess

35:39.180 --> 35:42.240
 as an art form.

35:42.240 --> 35:47.380
 Those are those moves and combinations that just show such flair, panache and, and, and

35:47.380 --> 35:50.500
 in soul, um, computers weren't really great at that.

35:50.500 --> 35:56.820
 They were great positional monsters and you know, recently we, we've started seeing brilliancies

35:56.820 --> 35:57.820
 and so.

35:57.820 --> 36:03.100
 The grandmasters have identified with, uh, with alpha zero that things were quite brilliant.

36:03.100 --> 36:04.100
 Yeah.

36:04.100 --> 36:06.780
 So that's, that's, that's a, you know, that's an example of something we don't think that

36:06.780 --> 36:12.220
 that's AGI, but in a very restricted set, a set of rules like chess, you're starting

36:12.220 --> 36:15.980
 to see poetry, uh, of a high order.

36:15.980 --> 36:22.740
 And, and so I'm not, I don't like the idea that we're waiting for AGI, AGI is sort of

36:22.740 --> 36:29.780
 slowly infiltrating our lives in the same way that I don't think a worm should be, you

36:29.780 --> 36:34.760
 know, the C elegans shouldn't be treated as non conscious because it only has 300 neurons.

36:34.760 --> 36:39.080
 Maybe it just has a very low level of consciousness because we don't understand what these things

36:39.080 --> 36:40.860
 mean as they scale up.

36:40.860 --> 36:43.700
 So am I worried about this general phenomena?

36:43.700 --> 36:44.700
 Sure.

36:44.700 --> 36:48.240
 But I think that one of the things that's happening is that a lot of us are fretting

36:48.240 --> 36:53.620
 about this, uh, in part because of human needs.

36:53.620 --> 36:56.220
 We've always been worried about the Golem, right?

36:56.220 --> 37:01.660
 Well, the Golem is the artificially created life, you know, it's like Frankenstein.

37:01.660 --> 37:02.660
 Yeah, sure.

37:02.660 --> 37:10.760
 It's a Jewish version and, um, Frankenberg, Frankenstein, yeah, that's makes sense, right?

37:10.760 --> 37:16.920
 So the, uh, but we've always been worried about creating something like this and it's

37:16.920 --> 37:23.460
 getting closer and closer and there are ways in which

37:23.460 --> 37:27.260
 we have to realize that the whole thing is kind of, the whole thing that we've experienced

37:27.260 --> 37:32.140
 are the context of our lives is almost certainly coming to an end.

37:32.140 --> 37:37.700
 And I don't mean to suggest that, uh, we won't survive.

37:37.700 --> 37:39.060
 I don't know.

37:39.060 --> 37:43.900
 And I don't mean to suggest that it's coming tomorrow and it could be 300, 500 years, but

37:43.900 --> 37:49.600
 there's no plan that I'm aware of if we have three rocks that we could possibly inhabit

37:49.600 --> 37:58.300
 that are, uh, sensible within current technological dreams, the earth, the moon and Mars.

37:58.300 --> 38:04.860
 And we have a very competitive civilization that is still forced into violence to sort

38:04.860 --> 38:06.860
 out disputes that cannot be arbitrated.

38:06.860 --> 38:13.000
 It is not clear to me that we have a longterm future until we get to the next stage, which

38:13.000 --> 38:18.180
 is to figure out whether or not the Einsteinian speed limit can be broken.

38:18.180 --> 38:21.620
 And that requires our source code.

38:21.620 --> 38:25.720
 Our source code, the stuff in our brains to figure out what do you mean by our source

38:25.720 --> 38:26.720
 code?

38:26.720 --> 38:30.940
 The source code of the context, whatever it is that produces the quarks, the electrons,

38:30.940 --> 38:31.940
 the neutrinos.

38:31.940 --> 38:33.380
 Oh, our source code.

38:33.380 --> 38:34.380
 I got it.

38:34.380 --> 38:35.380
 So this is,

38:35.380 --> 38:38.100
 You're talking about stuff that's written in a higher level language.

38:38.100 --> 38:39.100
 Yeah.

38:39.100 --> 38:40.100
 Yeah.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.100
 That's right.

38:41.100 --> 38:42.100
 You're talking about the low level, the bits.

38:42.100 --> 38:43.100
 Yeah.

38:43.100 --> 38:46.600
 That's what is currently keeping us here.

38:46.600 --> 38:53.500
 We can't even imagine, you know, we have harebrained schemes for staying within the Einsteinian

38:53.500 --> 38:54.500
 speed limit.

38:54.500 --> 38:58.780
 Uh, you know, maybe if we could just drug ourselves and go into a suspended state or

38:58.780 --> 39:03.620
 we could have multiple generations of that, I think all that stuff is pretty silly, but

39:03.620 --> 39:07.740
 I think it's also pretty silly to imagine that our wisdom is going to increase to the

39:07.740 --> 39:14.140
 point that we can have the toys we have and, uh, we're not going to use them for 500 years.

39:14.140 --> 39:18.700
 Speaking of Einstein, I had a profound breakthrough when I realized you're just one letter away

39:18.700 --> 39:19.700
 from the guy.

39:19.700 --> 39:22.740
 Yeah, but I'm also one letter away from Feinstein.

39:22.740 --> 39:25.740
 It's, well, you get to pick.

39:25.740 --> 39:26.740
 Okay.

39:26.740 --> 39:32.620
 So unified theory, you know, you've worked, uh, you, you enjoy the beauty of geometry.

39:32.620 --> 39:34.420
 I don't actually know if you enjoy it.

39:34.420 --> 39:35.980
 You certainly are quite good at it.

39:35.980 --> 39:36.980
 I tremble before it.

39:36.980 --> 39:42.180
 If you're religious, that is one of the, I don't have to be religious.

39:42.180 --> 39:43.180
 It's just so beautiful.

39:43.180 --> 39:44.180
 You will tremble anyway.

39:44.180 --> 39:50.940
 I mean, I just read Einstein's biography and one of the ways, uh, one of the things you've

39:50.940 --> 39:59.060
 done is try to explore a unified theory, uh, talking about a 14 dimensional observers that

39:59.060 --> 40:02.220
 has the 4d space time continuum embedded in it.

40:02.220 --> 40:09.260
 I, I'm just curious how you think and how philosophically at a high level about something

40:09.260 --> 40:17.000
 more than four dimensions, uh, how do you try to, what, what does it make you feel?

40:17.000 --> 40:23.460
 Talking in the mathematical world about dimensions that are greater than the ones we can perceive.

40:23.460 --> 40:27.140
 Is there something that you take away that's more than just the math?

40:27.140 --> 40:32.700
 Well, first of all, stick out your tongue at me.

40:32.700 --> 40:33.700
 Okay.

40:33.700 --> 40:41.260
 Now on the front of that time, yeah, there was a sweet receptor and next to that were

40:41.260 --> 40:45.460
 salt receptors and two different sides, a little bit farther back.

40:45.460 --> 40:48.300
 There were sour receptors and you wouldn't show me the back of your tongue where your

40:48.300 --> 40:50.300
 bitter receptor was.

40:50.300 --> 40:51.300
 Show the good side always.

40:51.300 --> 40:52.300
 Okay.

40:52.300 --> 40:58.820
 So you had four dimensions of taste receptors, but you also had pain receptors on that tongue

40:58.820 --> 41:01.240
 and probably heat receptors on that time.

41:01.240 --> 41:05.400
 So let's assume that you had one of each, that would be six dimensions.

41:05.400 --> 41:12.260
 So when you eat something, you eat a slice of pizza and it's got some, some, uh, some

41:12.260 --> 41:17.740
 hot pepper on it, maybe some jalapeno, you're having a six dimensional experience, dude.

41:17.740 --> 41:23.900
 Do you think we overemphasize the value of time as one of the dimensions or space?

41:23.900 --> 41:27.580
 Well, we certainly overemphasize the value of time cause we like things to start and

41:27.580 --> 41:30.660
 end or we really don't like things to end, but they seem to.

41:30.660 --> 41:37.020
 Well, what if you flipped one of the spatial dimensions into being a temporal dimension?

41:37.020 --> 41:41.660
 And you and I were to meet in New York city and say, well, where, where and when should

41:41.660 --> 41:42.660
 we meet?

41:42.660 --> 41:50.580
 What about, I'll meet you on a 36 in Lexington at two in the afternoon and uh, 11 oclock

41:50.580 --> 41:53.300
 in the morning.

41:53.300 --> 41:55.300
 That would be very confusing.

41:55.300 --> 41:59.340
 Well, so it's convenient for us to think about time, you mean.

41:59.340 --> 42:03.580
 We happen to be in a delicious situation in which we have three dimensions of space and

42:03.580 --> 42:07.960
 one of time and they're woven together in this sort of strange fabric where we can trade

42:07.960 --> 42:11.820
 off a little space for a little time, but we still only have one dimension that is picked

42:11.820 --> 42:13.480
 out relative to the other three.

42:13.480 --> 42:15.660
 It's very much Gladys Knight and the pips.

42:15.660 --> 42:17.700
 So which one developed for who?

42:17.700 --> 42:22.820
 Do we develop for these dimensions or did the dimensions or were they always there and

42:22.820 --> 42:23.820
 it doesn't?

42:23.820 --> 42:27.300
 Well, do you imagine that there isn't a place where there are four temporal dimensions or

42:27.300 --> 42:31.820
 two and two of space and time or three of time and one of space and then would time

42:31.820 --> 42:33.960
 not be playing the role of space?

42:33.960 --> 42:37.580
 Why do you imagine that the sector that you're in is all that there is?

42:37.580 --> 42:40.820
 I certainly do not, but I can't imagine otherwise.

42:40.820 --> 42:46.180
 I mean, I haven't done ayahuasca or any of those drugs that hope to one day, but instead

42:46.180 --> 42:49.660
 of doing ayahuasca, you could just head over to building two.

42:49.660 --> 42:50.780
 That's where the mathematicians are?

42:50.780 --> 42:52.260
 Yeah, that's where they hang.

42:52.260 --> 42:53.260
 Just to look at some geometry.

42:53.260 --> 42:55.620
 Well, just ask about pseudo Ramanian geometry.

42:55.620 --> 42:57.620
 That's what you're interested in.

42:57.620 --> 42:58.620
 Okay.

42:58.620 --> 43:01.660
 Or you could talk to a shaman and end up in Peru.

43:01.660 --> 43:03.140
 And then it's an extra money for that trip.

43:03.140 --> 43:06.460
 Yeah, but you won't be able to do any calculations if that's how you choose to go about it.

43:06.460 --> 43:09.100
 Well, a different kind of calculation, so to speak.

43:09.100 --> 43:10.100
 Yeah.

43:10.100 --> 43:14.020
 One of my favorite people, Edward Frankel, Berkeley professor, author of Love and Math,

43:14.020 --> 43:20.260
 great title for a book, said that you are quite a remarkable intellect to come up with

43:20.260 --> 43:25.660
 such beautiful original ideas in terms of unified theory and so on, but you're working

43:25.660 --> 43:28.260
 outside academia.

43:28.260 --> 43:33.940
 So one question in developing ideas that are truly original, truly interesting, what's

43:33.940 --> 43:39.660
 the difference between inside academia and outside academia when it comes to developing

43:39.660 --> 43:40.660
 such ideas?

43:40.660 --> 43:41.860
 Oh, it's a terrible choice.

43:41.860 --> 43:43.260
 Terrible choice.

43:43.260 --> 43:55.220
 So if you do it inside of academics, you are forced to constantly show great loyalty to

43:55.220 --> 44:03.020
 the consensus and you distinguish yourself with small, almost microscopic heresies to

44:03.020 --> 44:07.220
 make your reputation in general.

44:07.220 --> 44:14.180
 And you have very competent people and brilliant people who are working together, who form

44:14.180 --> 44:22.780
 very deep social networks and have a very high level of behavior, at least within mathematics

44:22.780 --> 44:27.880
 and at least technically within physics, theoretical physics.

44:27.880 --> 44:35.260
 When you go outside, you meet lunatics and crazy people, madmen.

44:35.260 --> 44:41.220
 And these are people who do not usually subscribe to the consensus position and almost always

44:41.220 --> 44:44.360
 lose their way.

44:44.360 --> 44:52.380
 And the key question is, will progress likely come from someone who has miraculously managed

44:52.380 --> 44:59.100
 to stay within the system and is able to take on a larger amount of heresy that is sort

44:59.100 --> 45:01.260
 of unthinkable?

45:01.260 --> 45:07.860
 In which case, that will be fascinating, or is it more likely that somebody will maintain

45:07.860 --> 45:15.780
 a level of discipline from outside of academics and be able to make use of the freedom that

45:15.780 --> 45:21.500
 comes from not having to constantly affirm your loyalty to the consensus of your field?

45:21.500 --> 45:28.460
 So you've characterized in ways that academia in this particular sense is declining.

45:28.460 --> 45:34.900
 You posted a plot, the older population of the faculty is getting larger, the younger

45:34.900 --> 45:37.260
 is getting smaller and so on.

45:37.260 --> 45:40.540
 So which direction of the two are you more hopeful about?

45:40.540 --> 45:42.660
 Well, the baby boomers can't hang on forever.

45:42.660 --> 45:46.440
 First of all, in general, true, and second of all, in academia.

45:46.440 --> 45:51.540
 But that's really what this time is about.

45:51.540 --> 45:57.180
 We're used to financial bubbles that last a few years in length and then pop.

45:57.180 --> 46:04.020
 The baby boomer bubble is this really long lived thing, and all of the ideology, all

46:04.020 --> 46:07.260
 of the behavior patterns, the norms.

46:07.260 --> 46:11.660
 For example, string theory is an almost entirely baby boomer phenomenon.

46:11.660 --> 46:16.620
 It was something that baby boomers were able to do because it required a very high level

46:16.620 --> 46:20.620
 of mathematical ability.

46:20.620 --> 46:24.260
 You don't think of string theory as an original idea?

46:24.260 --> 46:29.900
 Oh, I mean, it was original to Veneziano, probably is older than the baby boomers.

46:29.900 --> 46:32.780
 And there are people who are younger than the baby boomers who are still doing string

46:32.780 --> 46:33.780
 theory.

46:33.780 --> 46:37.920
 And I'm not saying that nothing discovered within the large string theoretic complex

46:37.920 --> 46:38.920
 is wrong.

46:38.920 --> 46:39.920
 Quite the contrary.

46:39.920 --> 46:44.500
 A lot of brilliant mathematics and a lot of the structure of physics was elucidated by

46:44.500 --> 46:46.940
 string theorists.

46:46.940 --> 46:51.560
 What do I think of the deliverable nature of this product that will not ship called

46:51.560 --> 46:52.560
 string theory?

46:52.560 --> 46:57.540
 I think that it is largely an affirmative action program for highly mathematically and

46:57.540 --> 47:03.240
 geometrically talented baby boomer physics physicists so that they can say that they're

47:03.240 --> 47:10.480
 working on something within the constraints of what they will say is quantum gravity.

47:10.480 --> 47:15.460
 Now there are other schemes, you know, there's like asymptotic safety, there are other things

47:15.460 --> 47:17.100
 that you could imagine doing.

47:17.100 --> 47:26.780
 I don't think much of any of the major programs, but to have inflicted this level of loyalty

47:26.780 --> 47:27.780
 through a shibboleth.

47:27.780 --> 47:29.420
 Well, surely you don't question X.

47:29.420 --> 47:32.380
 Well, I question almost everything in the string program.

47:32.380 --> 47:34.300
 And that's why I got out of physics.

47:34.300 --> 47:39.060
 When you called me a physicist, it was a great honor, but the reason I didn't become a physicist

47:39.060 --> 47:41.340
 wasn't that I fell in love with mathematics.

47:41.340 --> 47:49.060
 I said, wow, in 1984, 1983, I saw the field going mad and I saw that mathematics, which

47:49.060 --> 47:52.980
 has all sorts of problems, was not going insane.

47:52.980 --> 47:57.500
 And so instead of studying things within physics, I thought it was much safer to study the same

47:57.500 --> 47:59.900
 objects within mathematics.

47:59.900 --> 48:01.220
 There's a huge price to pay for that.

48:01.220 --> 48:03.740
 You lose physical intuition.

48:03.740 --> 48:08.260
 But the point is, is that it wasn't a North Korean reeducation camp either.

48:08.260 --> 48:15.500
 Are you hopeful about cracking open the Einstein unified theory in a way that has been really,

48:15.500 --> 48:21.420
 really understanding whether this, uh, uniting everything together with quantum theory and

48:21.420 --> 48:22.420
 so on?

48:22.420 --> 48:28.340
 I mean, I'm trying to play this role myself to do it to the extent of handing it over

48:28.340 --> 48:34.300
 to the more responsible, more professional, more competent community.

48:34.300 --> 48:40.540
 Um, so I think that they're wrong about a great number of their belief structures, but

48:40.540 --> 48:45.660
 I do believe, I mean, I have a really profound love, hate relationship with this group of

48:45.660 --> 48:46.660
 people.

48:46.660 --> 48:51.780
 I think the physics side, cause the mathematicians actually seem to be much more open minded

48:51.780 --> 48:55.940
 and uh, well they are and they aren't, they're open minded about anything that looks like

48:55.940 --> 48:56.940
 great math.

48:56.940 --> 48:57.940
 Right.

48:57.940 --> 48:58.940
 Right.

48:58.940 --> 49:01.820
 They'll study something that isn't very important physics, but if it's beautiful mathematics,

49:01.820 --> 49:07.780
 then they'll have a, they have great intuition about these things as good as the mathematicians

49:07.780 --> 49:08.780
 are.

49:08.780 --> 49:12.780
 And I might even intellectually at some horsepower level, give them the edge.

49:12.780 --> 49:16.700
 The theoretical theoretical physics community is bar none.

49:16.700 --> 49:22.020
 The most profound intellectual community that we have ever created.

49:22.020 --> 49:23.700
 It is the number one.

49:23.700 --> 49:28.460
 There's nobody in second place as far as I'm concerned, like in their spare time and the

49:28.460 --> 49:30.620
 spare time they invented molecular biology.

49:30.620 --> 49:33.180
 What, what was the origin of molecular biology?

49:33.180 --> 49:34.700
 You're saying something like Francis Crick.

49:34.700 --> 49:39.180
 I mean, a lot of, a lot of the early molecular biologists were physicists.

49:39.180 --> 49:40.180
 Yeah.

49:40.180 --> 49:44.420
 I mean, you know, Schrodinger wrote what is life and that was highly inspirational.

49:44.420 --> 49:53.340
 I mean, you have to appreciate that there is no community like the basic research community

49:53.340 --> 49:59.380
 in theoretical physics and it's not something I'm highly critical of these guys.

49:59.380 --> 50:08.420
 I think that they would just wasted the decades of time with a near religious devotion to

50:08.420 --> 50:13.340
 their misconception of where the problems were in physics.

50:13.340 --> 50:20.060
 But this has been the greatest intellectual collapse ever witnessed within academics.

50:20.060 --> 50:22.300
 You see it as a collapse or just a lull?

50:22.300 --> 50:26.020
 Oh, I'm terrified that we're about to lose the vitality.

50:26.020 --> 50:29.340
 We can't afford to pay these people.

50:29.340 --> 50:33.420
 We can't afford to give them an accelerator just to play with in case they find something

50:33.420 --> 50:35.300
 at the next energy level.

50:35.300 --> 50:38.420
 These people created our economy.

50:38.420 --> 50:41.900
 They gave us the rad lab and radar.

50:41.900 --> 50:45.620
 They gave us two atomic devices to end world war two.

50:45.620 --> 50:51.700
 They created the semiconductor and the transistor to power our economy through Moore's law.

50:51.700 --> 50:57.360
 As a positive externality of particle accelerators, they created the worldwide web and we have

50:57.360 --> 51:02.420
 the insolence to say, why should we fund you with our taxpayer dollars?

51:02.420 --> 51:08.860
 No, the question is, are you enjoying your physics dollars?

51:08.860 --> 51:15.780
 These guys signed the world's worst licensing agreement and if they simply charged for every

51:15.780 --> 51:23.540
 time you used a transistor or a URL or enjoyed the piece that they have provided during this

51:23.540 --> 51:29.140
 period of time through the terrible weapons that they developed or your communications

51:29.140 --> 51:34.060
 devices, all of the things that power our economy, I really think came out of physics,

51:34.060 --> 51:37.020
 even to the extent the chemistry came out of physics and molecular biology came out

51:37.020 --> 51:38.020
 of physics.

51:38.020 --> 51:42.780
 So, first of all, you have to know that I'm very critical of this community.

51:42.780 --> 51:45.180
 Second of all, it is our most important community.

51:45.180 --> 51:46.180
 We have neglected it.

51:46.180 --> 51:47.660
 We've abused it.

51:47.660 --> 51:49.820
 We don't take it seriously.

51:49.820 --> 51:55.780
 We don't even care to get them to rehab after a couple of generations of failure, right?

51:55.780 --> 52:01.060
 No one, I think the youngest person to have really contributed to the standard model of

52:01.060 --> 52:05.780
 theoretical level was born in 1951, right?

52:05.780 --> 52:15.020
 Frank Wilczek and almost nothing has happened that in theoretical physics after 1973, 74

52:15.020 --> 52:21.780
 that sent somebody to Stockholm for theoretical development that predicted experiment.

52:21.780 --> 52:24.580
 So we have to understand that we are doing this to ourselves.

52:24.580 --> 52:31.340
 Now, with that said, these guys have behaved abysmally in my opinion because they haven't

52:31.340 --> 52:35.540
 owned up to where they actually are, what problems they're really facing, how definite

52:35.540 --> 52:37.380
 they can actually be.

52:37.380 --> 52:40.820
 They haven't shared some of their most brilliant discoveries, which are desperately needed

52:40.820 --> 52:45.740
 in other fields like gauge theory, which at least the mathematicians can, can share, which

52:45.740 --> 52:49.180
 is an upgrade of the differential calculus of Newton and Leibniz.

52:49.180 --> 52:53.100
 And they haven't shared the importance of renormalization theory.

52:53.100 --> 52:57.940
 Even though this should be standard operating procedure for people across the sciences dealing

52:57.940 --> 53:01.180
 with different layers and different levels of phenomena.

53:01.180 --> 53:06.240
 And by shared, you mean communicated in such a way that it disseminates throughout the

53:06.240 --> 53:07.240
 different sizes.

53:07.240 --> 53:12.180
 These guys are sitting, both theoretical physicists and mathematicians are sitting on top of a

53:12.180 --> 53:16.420
 giant stockpile of intellectual gold, right?

53:16.420 --> 53:19.740
 They have so many things that have not been manifested anywhere.

53:19.740 --> 53:25.260
 I was just on Twitter, I think I mentioned the Habermann switch pitch that shows the

53:25.260 --> 53:28.980
 self duality of the tetrahedron realized as a linkage mechanism.

53:28.980 --> 53:36.540
 Now this is like a triviality and it makes an amazing toy that's, you know, built a market,

53:36.540 --> 53:38.460
 hopefully a fortune for Chuck Habermann.

53:38.460 --> 53:44.740
 Well, you have no idea how much great stuff that these priests have in their monastery.

53:44.740 --> 53:47.540
 So it's truly a love and hate relationship for you.

53:47.540 --> 53:48.540
 Yeah.

53:48.540 --> 53:49.540
 Well, it sounds like it's more on the love side.

53:49.540 --> 53:54.740
 This building that we're in right here is the building in which I really put together

53:54.740 --> 54:00.180
 the conspiracy between the National Academy of Sciences and the National Science Foundation

54:00.180 --> 54:04.400
 through the government university industry research round table to destroy the bargaining

54:04.400 --> 54:10.980
 power of American academics, uh, using foreign labor with, uh, on microfeature in the base.

54:10.980 --> 54:11.980
 Oh yeah.

54:11.980 --> 54:13.220
 That was done here in this building.

54:13.220 --> 54:14.220
 Isn't that weird?

54:14.220 --> 54:19.220
 And I'm, I'm truly speaking with a revolutionary and a radical, uh, no, no, no, no, no, no,

54:19.220 --> 54:20.220
 no, no, no, no, no, no.

54:20.220 --> 54:25.220
 At an intellectual level, I am absolutely garden variety.

54:25.220 --> 54:27.660
 I'm just straight down the middle.

54:27.660 --> 54:33.660
 The system that we are in this, this university is functionally insane.

54:33.660 --> 54:34.660
 Yeah.

54:34.660 --> 54:41.140
 Harvard is functionally insane and we don't understand that when we get these things wrong,

54:41.140 --> 54:43.660
 the financial crisis made this very clear.

54:43.660 --> 54:49.340
 There was a long period where every grownup, everybody with a tie, uh, who spoke in a,

54:49.340 --> 54:54.820
 you know, in Barrett, baritone tones, uh, with, with the right degree at the end of

54:54.820 --> 54:55.820
 their name.

54:55.820 --> 54:56.820
 Yeah.

54:56.820 --> 54:59.420
 Uh, we're talking about how we banished volunteer volatility.

54:59.420 --> 55:01.100
 We were in the great moderation.

55:01.100 --> 55:02.260
 Okay.

55:02.260 --> 55:04.100
 They were all crazy.

55:04.100 --> 55:05.100
 And who was, who was right?

55:05.100 --> 55:08.460
 It was like Nassim Taleb, Nouriel Roubini.

55:08.460 --> 55:13.980
 Now what happens is, is that they claimed the market went crazy, but the market didn't

55:13.980 --> 55:14.980
 go crazy.

55:14.980 --> 55:18.620
 The market had been crazy and what happened is, is that it suddenly went sane.

55:18.620 --> 55:21.660
 Well, that's where we are with academics.

55:21.660 --> 55:25.500
 Academics right now is mad as a hatter and it's, it's absolutely evident.

55:25.500 --> 55:27.000
 I can show you graph after graph.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.500
 I can show you the internal discussions.

55:28.500 --> 55:30.900
 I can show you the conspiracies.

55:30.900 --> 55:35.380
 Barrett's dealing with one right now over, uh, it's admissions policies for people, uh,

55:35.380 --> 55:38.300
 of color, uh, who happened to come from Asia.

55:38.300 --> 55:41.420
 All of this madness is necessary to keep the game going.

55:41.420 --> 55:46.940
 What we're talking about just on, well, we're on the topic of revolutionaries is we're talking

55:46.940 --> 55:50.060
 about the danger of an outbreak of sanity.

55:50.060 --> 55:51.060
 Yeah.

55:51.060 --> 55:57.020
 You're, you're the guy pointing out the elephant in the room here and the elephant has no clothes.

55:57.020 --> 55:59.540
 Is that how that goes?

55:59.540 --> 56:07.980
 I was going to talk a little bit to, uh, Joe Rogan about this, ran out of time, but I think

56:07.980 --> 56:13.420
 you're, you have some, you, just listening to you, you could probably speak really eloquently

56:13.420 --> 56:16.580
 to academia on the difference between the different fields.

56:16.580 --> 56:21.740
 So you think there's a difference between science, engineering, and then the humanities

56:21.740 --> 56:25.940
 in academia in terms of tolerance that they're willing to tolerate?

56:25.940 --> 56:33.020
 So from my perspective, I thought computer science and maybe engineering is more tolerant

56:33.020 --> 56:38.580
 to radical ideas, but that's perhaps innocent of me is that I always, you know, all the

56:38.580 --> 56:42.380
 battles going on now are a little bit more on the humanity side and gender studies and

56:42.380 --> 56:43.380
 so on.

56:43.380 --> 56:48.140
 Have you seen the, uh, American mathematical society's publication of an essay called get

56:48.140 --> 56:49.140
 out the way?

56:49.140 --> 56:50.140
 I have not.

56:50.140 --> 56:55.100
 What's, what's the idea is that white men who hold, uh, positions.

56:55.100 --> 56:56.540
 Yeah.

56:56.540 --> 57:01.300
 Within universities and mathematics should vacate their positions so that young black

57:01.300 --> 57:04.020
 women can take over something like this.

57:04.020 --> 57:07.240
 That's in terms of diversity, which I also want to ask you about, but in terms of diversity

57:07.240 --> 57:14.980
 of strictly ideas, do you think, cause you're basically saying physics as a community has

57:14.980 --> 57:21.460
 become a little bit intolerant to some degree to new radical ideas, or at least you, uh,

57:21.460 --> 57:26.940
 you said it's changed a little bit recently, which is that even string theory is now admitting,

57:26.940 --> 57:32.960
 okay, we don't look very promising in the short term, right?

57:32.960 --> 57:39.860
 So the question is what compiles if you want to take the computer science metaphor, what

57:39.860 --> 57:42.060
 will get you into a journal?

57:42.060 --> 57:47.060
 Will you spend your life trying to push some paper into a journal or will it be accepted

57:47.060 --> 57:48.060
 easily?

57:48.060 --> 57:56.660
 What about the characteristics of the submitter and what gets taken up and what does not?

57:56.660 --> 58:01.780
 All of these fields are experiencing pressure because no field is performing so brilliantly

58:01.780 --> 58:11.320
 well, um, that it's revolutionizing our way of speaking and thinking in the ways in which

58:11.320 --> 58:12.900
 we've become accustomed.

58:12.900 --> 58:19.340
 But don't you think even in theoretical physics, a lot of times, even with theories like string

58:19.340 --> 58:24.180
 theory, you could speak to this, it does eventually lead to what are the ways that this theory

58:24.180 --> 58:25.660
 would be testable.

58:25.660 --> 58:31.960
 Yeah, ultimately, although look, there's this thing about popper and the scientific method

58:31.960 --> 58:36.400
 that's a cancer and a disease and the minds of very smart people.

58:36.400 --> 58:39.860
 That's not really how most of the stuff gets worked out.

58:39.860 --> 58:41.340
 It's how it gets checked.

58:41.340 --> 58:47.380
 All right, so, and there is a dialogue between theory and experiment, but everybody should

58:47.380 --> 58:56.980
 read Paul directs 1963 American scientific American article where he, he, you know, it's

58:56.980 --> 58:57.980
 very interesting.

58:57.980 --> 59:03.160
 He talks about it as if it was about the Schrodinger equation and Schrodinger's failure to advance

59:03.160 --> 59:06.340
 his own work because of his failure to account for some phenomenon.

59:06.340 --> 59:10.400
 The key point is that if your theory is a slight bit off, it won't agree with experiment,

59:10.400 --> 59:12.940
 but it doesn't mean that the theory is actually wrong.

59:12.940 --> 59:18.700
 Um, but direct could as easily have been talking about his own equation in which he predicted

59:18.700 --> 59:22.460
 that the electrons should have an antiparticle.

59:22.460 --> 59:26.820
 And since the only positively charged particle that was known at the time was the proton,

59:26.820 --> 59:30.780
 Heisenberg pointed out, well, shouldn't your antiparticle, the proton have the same mass

59:30.780 --> 59:33.660
 as the electron and doesn't that invalidate your theory?

59:33.660 --> 59:38.860
 So I think the direct was actually being quite potentially quite sneaky, um, and, uh, talking

59:38.860 --> 59:42.980
 about the fact that he had been pushed off of his own theory to some extent by Heisenberg.

59:42.980 --> 59:51.580
 Um, but look, we've fetishized the scientific method and popper and falsification, um, because

59:51.580 --> 59:55.580
 it protects us from crazy ideas entering the field.

59:55.580 --> 59:58.420
 So you know, it's a question of balancing type one and type two error.

59:58.420 --> 1:00:01.560
 And we're pretty, we were pretty maxed out in one direction.

1:00:01.560 --> 1:00:08.020
 The opposite of that, let me say what comforts me sort of biology or engineering, uh, at

1:00:08.020 --> 1:00:10.860
 the end of the day, does the thing work?

1:00:10.860 --> 1:00:11.860
 Yeah.

1:00:11.860 --> 1:00:15.580
 You can test the crazies away and the crazy.

1:00:15.580 --> 1:00:19.700
 Well see now you're saying, but some ideas are truly crazy and some are, are actually

1:00:19.700 --> 1:00:20.700
 correct.

1:00:20.700 --> 1:00:24.140
 So, well there's pre correct currently crazy.

1:00:24.140 --> 1:00:25.140
 Yeah.

1:00:25.140 --> 1:00:26.140
 Right.

1:00:26.140 --> 1:00:30.020
 And so you don't want to get rid of everybody who's pre correct and currently crazy.

1:00:30.020 --> 1:00:37.020
 Um, the problem is, is that we don't have standards in general for trying to determine

1:00:37.020 --> 1:00:42.180
 who has to be put to the sword in terms of their career and who has to be protected,

1:00:42.180 --> 1:00:47.940
 uh, as some sort of giant time suck pain in the ass, uh, who may change everything.

1:00:47.940 --> 1:00:48.940
 Do you think that's possible?

1:00:48.940 --> 1:00:51.180
 Uh, creating a mechanism of those select?

1:00:51.180 --> 1:00:53.860
 Well, you're not going to like the answer, but here it comes.

1:00:53.860 --> 1:00:54.860
 Oh boy.

1:00:54.860 --> 1:00:59.440
 It has to do with very human elements.

1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:02.580
 We're trying to do this at the level of like rules and fairness.

1:01:02.580 --> 1:01:10.980
 That's not going to work cause the only thing that really understands this, you read the

1:01:10.980 --> 1:01:11.980
 double helix?

1:01:11.980 --> 1:01:12.980
 It's a book.

1:01:12.980 --> 1:01:16.140
 Oh, you have to read this book.

1:01:16.140 --> 1:01:22.060
 Not only did Jim Watson, uh, half discover this three dimensional structure of DNA, he's

1:01:22.060 --> 1:01:28.420
 also one hell of a writer before he became an ass, uh, that no, he's tried to destroy

1:01:28.420 --> 1:01:29.620
 his own reputation.

1:01:29.620 --> 1:01:33.060
 I knew about the ass, I didn't know about the good writer.

1:01:33.060 --> 1:01:36.180
 Jim Watson is one of the most important people now living.

1:01:36.180 --> 1:01:42.140
 And uh, as I've said before, Jim Watson is too important, a legacy to be left to Jim

1:01:42.140 --> 1:01:43.140
 Watson.

1:01:43.140 --> 1:01:49.500
 Um, yeah, that book tells you more about what actually moves the dial, right?

1:01:49.500 --> 1:01:53.700
 There's another story about him, which I don't, don't agree with, which is that he stole everything

1:01:53.700 --> 1:01:54.700
 from Rosalind Franklin.

1:01:54.700 --> 1:01:58.840
 I mean the, the problems that he had with Rosalind Franklin are real, but we should

1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:04.260
 actually honor that tension in our history by delving into it rather than having a simple

1:02:04.260 --> 1:02:05.260
 solution.

1:02:05.260 --> 1:02:10.180
 Jim Watson talks about Francis Crick being a pain in the ass that everybody secretly

1:02:10.180 --> 1:02:12.840
 knew was super brilliant.

1:02:12.840 --> 1:02:19.260
 And there's an encounter between, uh, Chargaff, uh, who came up with the equimolar relations

1:02:19.260 --> 1:02:25.140
 between the nucleotides who should have gotten the structure of DNA and Watson and Crick.

1:02:25.140 --> 1:02:30.900
 And you know, he talks about missing a shiver in the heartbeat of biology and stuff is so

1:02:30.900 --> 1:02:31.900
 gorgeous.

1:02:31.900 --> 1:02:35.220
 It just makes you tremble even thinking about it.

1:02:35.220 --> 1:02:42.980
 Um, look, we know very often who is to be feared and we need to fund the people that

1:02:42.980 --> 1:02:45.160
 we fear.

1:02:45.160 --> 1:02:49.740
 The people who are wasting our time need to be excluded from the conversation.

1:02:49.740 --> 1:02:54.980
 You see, and you know, maybe we'll make some errors in both directions.

1:02:54.980 --> 1:02:58.200
 But we have known our own people.

1:02:58.200 --> 1:03:02.500
 We know the pains in the asses that might work out and we know the people who are really

1:03:02.500 --> 1:03:06.780
 just blowhards who really have very little to contribute most of the time.

1:03:06.780 --> 1:03:10.140
 It's not a hundred percent, but you're not going to get there with rules.

1:03:10.140 --> 1:03:11.140
 Right.

1:03:11.140 --> 1:03:12.620
 It's a using some kind of instinct.

1:03:12.620 --> 1:03:18.500
 I mean, I, to be honest, I'm going to make you roll your eyes for a second, but uh, and

1:03:18.500 --> 1:03:21.760
 the first time I heard that there is a large community of people who believe the earth

1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:27.980
 is flat actually made me pause and ask myself the question, why would there be such a community?

1:03:27.980 --> 1:03:28.980
 Yeah.

1:03:28.980 --> 1:03:30.260
 Is it possible the earth is flat?

1:03:30.260 --> 1:03:33.140
 So I had to like, wait a minute.

1:03:33.140 --> 1:03:37.620
 I mean, then you go through a thinking process that I think is really healthy.

1:03:37.620 --> 1:03:39.580
 It ultimately ends up being a geometry thing.

1:03:39.580 --> 1:03:43.340
 I think, uh, it's an interesting, it's an interesting thought experiment at the very

1:03:43.340 --> 1:03:44.340
 least.

1:03:44.340 --> 1:03:46.540
 Well, I don't, I do a different version of it.

1:03:46.540 --> 1:03:48.460
 I say, why is this community stable?

1:03:48.460 --> 1:03:49.460
 Yeah.

1:03:49.460 --> 1:03:51.020
 That's a good, uh, way to analyze it.

1:03:51.020 --> 1:03:56.020
 Well, interesting that whatever we've done has not erased the community.

1:03:56.020 --> 1:04:00.660
 So you know, they're taking a long shot bet that won't pan out, you know, maybe we just

1:04:00.660 --> 1:04:04.580
 haven't thought enough about the rationality of the square root of two and somebody brilliant

1:04:04.580 --> 1:04:05.580
 will figure it out.

1:04:05.580 --> 1:04:11.540
 Maybe we will eventually land one day on the surface of Jupiter and explore it, right?

1:04:11.540 --> 1:04:14.220
 These are crazy things that will never happen.

1:04:14.220 --> 1:04:17.580
 So much of social media operates by AI algorithms.

1:04:17.580 --> 1:04:21.980
 You talked about this a little bit, uh, recommending the content you see.

1:04:21.980 --> 1:04:28.180
 So on this idea of radical thought, how much should AI show you things you disagree with

1:04:28.180 --> 1:04:34.460
 on Twitter and so on in a Twitter word verse in this question?

1:04:34.460 --> 1:04:35.460
 Yeah.

1:04:35.460 --> 1:04:36.460
 Yeah.

1:04:36.460 --> 1:04:37.460
 Cause you don't know the answer?

1:04:37.460 --> 1:04:38.460
 No, no, no, no.

1:04:38.460 --> 1:04:44.460
 Look, we've been, they've pushed out this cognitive Lego to us that will just lead to

1:04:44.460 --> 1:04:45.940
 madness.

1:04:45.940 --> 1:04:49.460
 It's good to be challenged with things that you disagree with.

1:04:49.460 --> 1:04:53.900
 The answer is no, it's good to be challenged with interesting things with which you currently

1:04:53.900 --> 1:04:56.700
 disagree, but that might be true.

1:04:56.700 --> 1:05:00.380
 So I don't really care about whether or not I disagree with something or don't disagree.

1:05:00.380 --> 1:05:05.460
 I need to know why that particular disagreeable thing is being pushed out.

1:05:05.460 --> 1:05:07.140
 Is it because it's likely to be true?

1:05:07.140 --> 1:05:09.900
 Is it because, is there some reason?

1:05:09.900 --> 1:05:14.380
 Because I can write, I can write a computer generator, uh, to come up with an infinite

1:05:14.380 --> 1:05:17.740
 number of disagreeable statements that nobody needs to look at.

1:05:17.740 --> 1:05:22.920
 So please, before you push things at me that are disagreeable, tell me why.

1:05:22.920 --> 1:05:26.220
 There is an aspect in which that question is quite dumb, especially because it's being

1:05:26.220 --> 1:05:34.140
 used to, uh, almost, um, uh, very generically by these different networks to say, well,

1:05:34.140 --> 1:05:35.620
 we're trying to work this out.

1:05:35.620 --> 1:05:43.100
 But you know, basically, uh, how much do you see the value of seeing things, uh, you don't

1:05:43.100 --> 1:05:47.660
 like, not you disagree with, because it's very difficult to know exactly what you articulated,

1:05:47.660 --> 1:05:53.460
 which is, uh, the stuff that's important for you to consider that you disagree with.

1:05:53.460 --> 1:05:55.040
 That's really hard to figure out.

1:05:55.040 --> 1:05:57.240
 The bottom line is this stuff you don't like.

1:05:57.240 --> 1:06:03.040
 If you're a, uh, uh, Hillary Clinton supporter, you may not want to, it might not make you

1:06:03.040 --> 1:06:05.980
 feel good to see anything about Donald Trump.

1:06:05.980 --> 1:06:08.420
 That's the only thing algorithms can really optimize for currently.

1:06:08.420 --> 1:06:09.420
 They really can't.

1:06:09.420 --> 1:06:10.660
 Now they can do better.

1:06:10.660 --> 1:06:11.660
 This is where we're.

1:06:11.660 --> 1:06:12.660
 You think so?

1:06:12.660 --> 1:06:21.660
 No, we're engaged in some moronic back and forth where I have no idea why people who

1:06:21.660 --> 1:06:27.580
 are capable of building Google, Facebook, Twitter are having us in these incredibly

1:06:27.580 --> 1:06:28.940
 low level discussions.

1:06:28.940 --> 1:06:31.260
 Do they not know any smart people?

1:06:31.260 --> 1:06:36.140
 Do they not have the phone numbers of people who can elevate these discussions?

1:06:36.140 --> 1:06:41.220
 They do, but this, they're optimizing for a different thing and they're pushing those

1:06:41.220 --> 1:06:42.500
 people out of those rooms.

1:06:42.500 --> 1:06:47.140
 They're, they're optimizing for things we can't see.

1:06:47.140 --> 1:06:48.580
 And yes, profit is there.

1:06:48.580 --> 1:06:54.620
 Nobody, nobody's questioning that, but they're also optimizing for things like political

1:06:54.620 --> 1:06:57.640
 control or the fact that they're doing business in Pakistan.

1:06:57.640 --> 1:07:01.300
 And so they don't want to talk about all the things that they're going to be bending to

1:07:01.300 --> 1:07:03.340
 in Pakistan.

1:07:03.340 --> 1:07:06.860
 So we're involved in a fake discussion.

1:07:06.860 --> 1:07:07.960
 You think so?

1:07:07.960 --> 1:07:11.340
 You think these conversations at that depth are happening inside Google?

1:07:11.340 --> 1:07:15.820
 You don't think they have some basic metrics under user engagements?

1:07:15.820 --> 1:07:18.320
 You're having a fake conversation with us guys.

1:07:18.320 --> 1:07:19.860
 We know you're having a fake conversation.

1:07:19.860 --> 1:07:23.700
 I do not wish to be part of your fake conversation.

1:07:23.700 --> 1:07:28.980
 You know how to cool, you know, these units, you know, high availability, like nobody's

1:07:28.980 --> 1:07:29.980
 business.

1:07:29.980 --> 1:07:31.780
 My Gmail never goes down.

1:07:31.780 --> 1:07:32.780
 Almost.

1:07:32.780 --> 1:07:38.380
 So you think just because they can do incredible work on the software side with infrastructure,

1:07:38.380 --> 1:07:46.420
 they can also deal with some of these difficult questions about human behavior, human understanding.

1:07:46.420 --> 1:07:47.420
 You're not.

1:07:47.420 --> 1:07:53.900
 I mean, I've seen the, I've seen the developers screens that people take shots of inside of

1:07:53.900 --> 1:07:55.380
 Google.

1:07:55.380 --> 1:07:58.540
 And I've heard stories inside of Facebook and Apple.

1:07:58.540 --> 1:08:00.720
 We're not, we're engaged.

1:08:00.720 --> 1:08:04.100
 They're engaging us in the wrong conversations.

1:08:04.100 --> 1:08:06.220
 We are not at this low level.

1:08:06.220 --> 1:08:08.260
 Here's one of my favorite questions.

1:08:08.260 --> 1:08:17.340
 Why is every piece of hardware that I purchase in tech space equipped as a listening device?

1:08:17.340 --> 1:08:19.780
 Where's my physical shutter to cover my lens?

1:08:19.780 --> 1:08:26.060
 We had this in the 1970s, cameras that had lens caps, you know, how much would it cost

1:08:26.060 --> 1:08:29.900
 to have a security model pay five extra bucks?

1:08:29.900 --> 1:08:33.100
 Why is my indicator light software controlled?

1:08:33.100 --> 1:08:37.980
 Why when my camera is on, do I not see that the light is on by putting it as something

1:08:37.980 --> 1:08:39.780
 that cannot be bypassed?

1:08:39.780 --> 1:08:45.460
 Why have you set up my, all of my devices at some difficulty to yourselves as listening

1:08:45.460 --> 1:08:47.780
 devices and we don't even talk about this.

1:08:47.780 --> 1:08:50.820
 This is, this thing is total fucking bullshit.

1:08:50.820 --> 1:08:55.420
 Well, I hope these discussions are happening about privacy.

1:08:55.420 --> 1:08:57.100
 Is there a more difficult thing you're giving them credit for?

1:08:57.100 --> 1:08:59.140
 It's not just privacy.

1:08:59.140 --> 1:09:01.140
 It's about social control.

1:09:01.140 --> 1:09:03.700
 We're talking about social control.

1:09:03.700 --> 1:09:07.260
 Why do I not have controls over my own levers?

1:09:07.260 --> 1:09:11.780
 Just have a really cute UI where I can switch, I can dial things or I can at least see what

1:09:11.780 --> 1:09:13.460
 the algorithms are.

1:09:13.460 --> 1:09:17.540
 You think that there is some deliberate choices being made here.

1:09:17.540 --> 1:09:21.700
 There's emergence and there is intention.

1:09:21.700 --> 1:09:23.000
 There are two dimensions.

1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:29.260
 The vector does not collapse onto either axis, but the idea that anybody who suggests that

1:09:29.260 --> 1:09:34.580
 intention is completely absent is a child.

1:09:34.580 --> 1:09:38.820
 That's really beautifully put and uh, like many things you've said is going to make me

1:09:38.820 --> 1:09:40.900
 can I turn this around slightly?

1:09:40.900 --> 1:09:41.900
 Yeah.

1:09:41.900 --> 1:09:45.660
 I sit down with you and you say that you're obsessed with my feed.

1:09:45.660 --> 1:09:47.740
 I don't even know what my feed is.

1:09:47.740 --> 1:09:49.700
 What are you seeing that I'm not?

1:09:49.700 --> 1:09:54.860
 I was obsessively looking through your feed on Twitter because it was really enjoyable

1:09:54.860 --> 1:09:58.300
 because there's the Tom layer element is the humor in it.

1:09:58.300 --> 1:10:03.180
 By the way, that feed is Eric R. Weinstein on Twitter at Eric R. Weinstein.

1:10:03.180 --> 1:10:06.720
 No, but seriously, why?

1:10:06.720 --> 1:10:10.180
 Why did I find it enjoyable or what was I seeing?

1:10:10.180 --> 1:10:11.180
 What are you looking for?

1:10:11.180 --> 1:10:13.020
 Why are we doing this?

1:10:13.020 --> 1:10:14.780
 What is this podcast about?

1:10:14.780 --> 1:10:16.460
 I know you've got all these interesting people.

1:10:16.460 --> 1:10:18.900
 I'm just some guy who's sort of a podcast guest.

1:10:18.900 --> 1:10:21.420
 Sort of a podcast.

1:10:21.420 --> 1:10:22.420
 You're not even wearing a tie.

1:10:22.420 --> 1:10:25.740
 I mean, it's not even a serious interview.

1:10:25.740 --> 1:10:34.540
 I'm searching for meaning, for happiness, for a dopamine rush, so short term, long term.

1:10:34.540 --> 1:10:37.340
 And how are you finding your way to me?

1:10:37.340 --> 1:10:41.460
 I don't honestly know what I'm doing to reach you.

1:10:41.460 --> 1:10:48.000
 The representing ideas which feel common sense to me and not many people are speaking.

1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:54.700
 So it's kind of like the intellectual dark web folks, right?

1:10:54.700 --> 1:11:00.580
 These folks from Sam Harris to Jordan Peterson to yourself are saying things where you're

1:11:00.580 --> 1:11:05.420
 like saying, look, there's an elephant and he's not wearing any clothes.

1:11:05.420 --> 1:11:09.580
 And I say, yeah, yeah, let's have more of that conversation.

1:11:09.580 --> 1:11:10.940
 That's how I'm finding you.

1:11:10.940 --> 1:11:14.700
 I'm desperate to try to change the conversation we're having.

1:11:14.700 --> 1:11:17.340
 I'm very worried we've got an election in 2020.

1:11:17.340 --> 1:11:23.960
 I don't think we can afford four more years of a misinterpreted message, which is what

1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:25.820
 Donald Trump was.

1:11:25.820 --> 1:11:28.420
 And I don't want the destruction of our institutions.

1:11:28.420 --> 1:11:30.740
 They all seem hell bent on destroying themselves.

1:11:30.740 --> 1:11:34.920
 So I'm trying to save theoretical physics, trying to save the New York Times, trying

1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:38.320
 to save our various processes.

1:11:38.320 --> 1:11:44.540
 And I think it feels delusional to me that this is falling to a tiny group of people

1:11:44.540 --> 1:11:49.780
 who are willing to speak out without getting so freaked out that everything they say will

1:11:49.780 --> 1:11:52.980
 be misinterpreted and that their lives will be ruined through the process.

1:11:52.980 --> 1:11:57.580
 I mean, I think we're in an absolutely bananas period of time and I don't believe it should

1:11:57.580 --> 1:12:02.580
 fall to such a tiny number of shoulders to shoulder this way.

1:12:02.580 --> 1:12:08.140
 So I have to ask you on the capitalism side, you mentioned that technology is killing capitalism

1:12:08.140 --> 1:12:15.240
 or it has effects that are unintended, well, not unintended, but not what economists would

1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:18.740
 predict or speak of capitalism creating.

1:12:18.740 --> 1:12:23.540
 I just want to talk to you about in general, the effect of even then artificial intelligence

1:12:23.540 --> 1:12:28.980
 or technology automation taking away jobs and these kinds of things and what you think

1:12:28.980 --> 1:12:34.240
 is the way to alleviate that, whether the Andrew Ng presidential candidate with universal

1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:38.780
 basic income, UBI, what are your thoughts there?

1:12:38.780 --> 1:12:41.940
 How do we fight off the negative effects of technology that...

1:12:41.940 --> 1:12:43.980
 All right, you're a software guy, right?

1:12:43.980 --> 1:12:44.980
 Yep.

1:12:44.980 --> 1:12:52.180
 A human being is a worker is an old idea, a human being has a worker is a different

1:12:52.180 --> 1:12:53.180
 object, right?

1:12:53.180 --> 1:12:54.180
 Yeah.

1:12:54.180 --> 1:12:59.420
 So if you think about object oriented programming as a paradigm, a human being has a worker

1:12:59.420 --> 1:13:01.940
 and a human being has a soul.

1:13:01.940 --> 1:13:07.740
 We're talking about the fact that for a period of time, the worker that a human being has

1:13:07.740 --> 1:13:11.700
 was in a position to feed the soul that a human being has.

1:13:11.700 --> 1:13:18.300
 However, we have two separate claims on the value in society.

1:13:18.300 --> 1:13:23.460
 One is as a worker and the other is as a soul and the soul needs sustenance, it needs dignity,

1:13:23.460 --> 1:13:27.500
 it needs meaning, it needs purpose.

1:13:27.500 --> 1:13:34.700
 As long as your means of support is not highly repetitive, I think you have a while to go

1:13:34.700 --> 1:13:37.020
 before you need to start worrying.

1:13:37.020 --> 1:13:41.820
 And if what you do is highly repetitive and it's not terribly generative, you are in the

1:13:41.820 --> 1:13:46.080
 cross hairs of for loops and while loops.

1:13:46.080 --> 1:13:51.940
 And that's what computers excel at, repetitive behavior and when I say repetitive, I may

1:13:51.940 --> 1:13:55.340
 mean things that have never happened through combinatorial possibilities, but as long as

1:13:55.340 --> 1:13:59.080
 it has a looped characteristic to it, you're in trouble.

1:13:59.080 --> 1:14:07.240
 We are seeing a massive push towards socialism because capitalists are slow to address the

1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:13.700
 fact that a worker may not be able to make claims, a relatively undistinguished median

1:14:13.700 --> 1:14:20.900
 member of our society is still has needs to reproduce, needs to have to dignity.

1:14:20.900 --> 1:14:28.900
 And when capitalism abandons the median individual or the bottom 10th or whatever it's going

1:14:28.900 --> 1:14:32.780
 to do, it's flirting with revolution.

1:14:32.780 --> 1:14:37.660
 And what concerns me is that the capitalists aren't sufficiently capitalistic to understand

1:14:37.660 --> 1:14:39.380
 this.

1:14:39.380 --> 1:14:45.200
 You really want to court authoritarian control in our society because you can't see that

1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:50.020
 people may not be able to defend themselves in the marketplace because the marginal product

1:14:50.020 --> 1:14:55.140
 of their labor was too low to feed their dignity as a soul.

1:14:55.140 --> 1:15:02.320
 So my great concern is that our free society has to do with the fact that we are self organized.

1:15:02.320 --> 1:15:06.520
 I remember looking down from my office in Manhattan when Lehman brothers collapsed and

1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:12.000
 thinking who's going to tell all these people that they need to show up at work when they

1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:17.520
 don't have a financial system to incentivize them to show up at work.

1:15:17.520 --> 1:15:22.040
 So my complaint is first of all, not with the socialists, but with the capitalists,

1:15:22.040 --> 1:15:24.640
 which is you guys are being idiots.

1:15:24.640 --> 1:15:30.780
 You're courting revolution by continuing to harp on the same old ideas that, well, you

1:15:30.780 --> 1:15:32.820
 know, try, try harder, bootstrap yourself.

1:15:32.820 --> 1:15:38.000
 Yeah, to an extent that works to an extent, but we are clearly headed in a place that

1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:45.540
 there's nothing that ties together our need to contribute and our need to consume.

1:15:45.540 --> 1:15:49.540
 And that may not be provided by capitalism because it may have been a temporary phenomena.

1:15:49.540 --> 1:15:55.480
 So check out my article on anthropic capitalism and the new gimmick economy.

1:15:55.480 --> 1:16:00.320
 I think people are late getting the wake up call and we would be doing a better job saving

1:16:00.320 --> 1:16:05.840
 capitalism from itself because I don't want this done under authoritarian control.

1:16:05.840 --> 1:16:11.080
 And the more we insist that everybody who's not thriving in our society during their reproductive

1:16:11.080 --> 1:16:15.280
 years in order to have a family is failing at a personal level.

1:16:15.280 --> 1:16:18.840
 I mean, what a disgusting thing that we're saying.

1:16:18.840 --> 1:16:23.440
 What horrible message who, who the hell have we become that we've so bought into the Chicago

1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:28.220
 model that we can't see the humanity that we're destroying in that process.

1:16:28.220 --> 1:16:31.240
 And it's, I hate, I hate the thought of communism.

1:16:31.240 --> 1:16:32.240
 I really do.

1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:34.640
 My family has flirted with it decades past.

1:16:34.640 --> 1:16:39.820
 It's a wrong, bad idea, but we are going to need to figure out how to make sure that those

1:16:39.820 --> 1:16:45.160
 souls are nourished and respected and capitalism better have an answer.

1:16:45.160 --> 1:16:48.120
 And I'm betting on capitalism, but I've got to tell you, I'm pretty disappointed with

1:16:48.120 --> 1:16:49.120
 my team.

1:16:49.120 --> 1:16:52.200
 So you're still on the capitalism team.

1:16:52.200 --> 1:16:55.280
 You just, uh, there's a theme here.

1:16:55.280 --> 1:16:56.280
 Radical capitalism.

1:16:56.280 --> 1:16:57.280
 Hyper capitalism.

1:16:57.280 --> 1:16:58.280
 Yeah.

1:16:58.280 --> 1:17:02.060
 I want, I think hyper capitalism is going to have to be coupled to hyper socialism.

1:17:02.060 --> 1:17:07.600
 You need to allow the most productive people to create wonders and you've got to stop bogging

1:17:07.600 --> 1:17:11.040
 them down with all of these extra nice requirements.

1:17:11.040 --> 1:17:13.360
 You know, nice is dead.

1:17:13.360 --> 1:17:14.760
 Good has a future.

1:17:14.760 --> 1:17:18.680
 Nice doesn't have a future because nice ends up with, with gulags.

1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:21.080
 Damn, that's a good line.

1:17:21.080 --> 1:17:22.080
 Okay.

1:17:22.080 --> 1:17:23.080
 Last question.

1:17:23.080 --> 1:17:30.520
 You tweeted today a simple, quite insightful equation saying, uh, imagine that every unit

1:17:30.520 --> 1:17:35.760
 F of fame you picked up as stalkers and H haters.

1:17:35.760 --> 1:17:39.640
 So I imagine S and H are dependent on your path to fame perhaps a little bit.

1:17:39.640 --> 1:17:40.640
 Well, it's not as simple.

1:17:40.640 --> 1:17:44.520
 I mean, people always take these things literally when you have like 280 characters to explain

1:17:44.520 --> 1:17:45.520
 yourself.

1:17:45.520 --> 1:17:50.520
 So you mean that that's not a mathematical, uh, no, there's no law.

1:17:50.520 --> 1:17:51.520
 Oh, okay.

1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:52.520
 All right.

1:17:52.520 --> 1:17:56.760
 So I put the word imagine because I still have a mathematician's desire for precision.

1:17:56.760 --> 1:18:00.880
 Imagine that this were true, but it was a beautiful way to imagine that there is a law

1:18:00.880 --> 1:18:03.720
 that has those variables in it.

1:18:03.720 --> 1:18:06.880
 And uh, you've become quite famous these days.

1:18:06.880 --> 1:18:12.640
 So how do you yourself optimize that equation with the peculiar kind of fame that you have

1:18:12.640 --> 1:18:13.720
 gathered along the way?

1:18:13.720 --> 1:18:14.760
 I want to be kinder.

1:18:14.760 --> 1:18:16.160
 I want to be kinder to myself.

1:18:16.160 --> 1:18:17.380
 I want to be kinder to others.

1:18:17.380 --> 1:18:24.920
 I want to be able to have heart, compassion, or these things are really important.

1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:28.960
 And uh, I have a pretty spectrumy kind of approach to analysis.

1:18:28.960 --> 1:18:29.960
 I'm quite literal.

1:18:29.960 --> 1:18:32.920
 I can go full rain man on you at any given moment.

1:18:32.920 --> 1:18:33.920
 No, I can't.

1:18:33.920 --> 1:18:34.920
 I can't.

1:18:34.920 --> 1:18:37.960
 Uh, it's facultative autism if you like, and people are gonna get angry because they want

1:18:37.960 --> 1:18:39.960
 autism to be respected.

1:18:39.960 --> 1:18:47.000
 So when you see me coding or you see me doing mathematics, I'm, you know, I speak with speech

1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:54.360
 apnea, uh, be right down to dinner, you know, we have to try to integrate ourselves and

1:18:54.360 --> 1:19:00.920
 those tensions between, you know, it's sort of back to us as a worker and us as a soul.

1:19:00.920 --> 1:19:06.000
 Many of us are optimizing one to the, at the expense of the other.

1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:11.720
 And I struggle with social media and I struggle with people making threats against our families

1:19:11.720 --> 1:19:15.840
 and I struggle with, um, just how much pain people are in.

1:19:15.840 --> 1:19:21.960
 And if there's one message I would like to push out there, um, you're responsible, everybody,

1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:27.640
 all of us, myself included with struggling, struggle, struggle mightily because you, it's

1:19:27.640 --> 1:19:30.880
 nobody else's job to do your struggle for you.

1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:34.360
 Now with that said, if you're struggling and you're trying and you're trying to figure

1:19:34.360 --> 1:19:38.640
 out how to better yourself and where you failed and where you've let down your family, your

1:19:38.640 --> 1:19:43.520
 friends, your workers, all this kind of stuff, give yourself a break.

1:19:43.520 --> 1:19:48.880
 You know, if, if, if it's not working out, I have a lifelong relationship with failure

1:19:48.880 --> 1:19:49.880
 and success.

1:19:49.880 --> 1:19:56.300
 There's been no period of my life where both haven't been present in one form or another.

1:19:56.300 --> 1:20:00.680
 And I do wish to say that a lot of times people think this is glamorous.

1:20:00.680 --> 1:20:04.640
 I'm about to go, you know, do a show with Sam Harris.

1:20:04.640 --> 1:20:07.360
 People are going to listen in on two guys having a conversation on stage.

1:20:07.360 --> 1:20:10.180
 It's completely crazy when I'm always trying to figure out how to make sure that those

1:20:10.180 --> 1:20:12.600
 people get maximum value.

1:20:12.600 --> 1:20:18.360
 And uh, that's why I'm doing this podcast, you know, just give yourself a break.

1:20:18.360 --> 1:20:20.580
 You owe us, you owe us your struggle.

1:20:20.580 --> 1:20:26.200
 You don't owe your family or your coworkers or your lovers or your family members success.

1:20:26.200 --> 1:20:31.420
 Um, as long as you're in there and you're picking yourself up, recognize that this,

1:20:31.420 --> 1:20:37.040
 this new situation with the economy that doesn't have the juice to sustain our institutions

1:20:37.040 --> 1:20:41.780
 has caused the people who've risen to the top of those institutions to get quite brutal

1:20:41.780 --> 1:20:43.800
 and cruel.

1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:45.400
 Everybody is lying at the moment.

1:20:45.400 --> 1:20:47.280
 Nobody's really a truth teller.

1:20:47.280 --> 1:20:50.280
 Um, try to keep your humanity about you.

1:20:50.280 --> 1:20:55.200
 Try to recognize that if you're failing, if things aren't where you want them to be and

1:20:55.200 --> 1:20:57.800
 you're struggling and you're trying to figure out what you're doing wrong, which you could

1:20:57.800 --> 1:21:01.360
 do, it's not necessarily all your fault.

1:21:01.360 --> 1:21:02.960
 We are in a global situation.

1:21:02.960 --> 1:21:08.640
 I have not met the people who are honest, kind, good, successful.

1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:13.040
 Nobody that I've met is checking all the boxes.

1:21:13.040 --> 1:21:14.580
 Nobody's getting all tens.

1:21:14.580 --> 1:21:18.960
 So I just think that's an important message that doesn't get pushed out enough.

1:21:18.960 --> 1:21:24.040
 Either people want to hold society responsible for their failures, which is not reasonable.

1:21:24.040 --> 1:21:27.740
 You have to struggle, you have to try, or they want to say you're a hundred percent

1:21:27.740 --> 1:21:31.960
 responsible for your failures, which is total nonsense.

1:21:31.960 --> 1:21:32.960
 Beautifully put.

1:21:32.960 --> 1:21:33.960
 Eric, thank you so much for talking today.

1:21:33.960 --> 1:21:55.560
 Thanks for having me, buddy.
