00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
 The following is a conversation with Luis and JoÃ£o Botala, brothers and cofounders of Fermat's

00:06.320 --> 00:12.800
 Library, which is an incredible platform for annotating papers. As they write on the Fermat's

00:12.800 --> 00:19.200
 Library website, just as Pierre de Fermat scribbled his famous last theorem in the margins, professional

00:19.200 --> 00:25.200
 scientists, academics, and citizen scientists can annotate equations, figures, ideas, and write

00:25.200 --> 00:31.600
 in the margins. Fermat's Library is also a really good Twitter account to follow. I highly recommend

00:31.600 --> 00:37.840
 it. They post little visual factoids and explorations that reveal the beauty of mathematics.

00:38.480 --> 00:47.840
 I love it. Quick mention of our sponsors. Skiff, SimplySafe, Indeed, NetSuite, and Four Sigmatic.

00:47.840 --> 00:52.800
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say a few words

00:52.800 --> 00:59.280
 about the dissemination of scientific ideas. I believe that all scientific articles should be

00:59.280 --> 01:05.840
 freely accessible to the public. They currently are not. In one analysis I saw, more than 70%

01:05.840 --> 01:11.040
 of published research articles are behind a paywall. In case you don't know, the funders of

01:11.040 --> 01:18.240
 the research, whether that's government or industry, aren't the ones putting up the paywall. The journals

01:18.240 --> 01:24.080
 are the ones putting up the paywall, while using unpaid labor from researchers for the peer review

01:24.080 --> 01:31.360
 process. Where is all that money from the paywall going? In this digital age, the costs here should

01:31.360 --> 01:37.600
 be minimal. This cost can easily be covered through donation, advertisement, or public funding of

01:37.600 --> 01:43.120
 science. The benefit versus the cost of all papers being free to read is obvious, and the fact that

01:43.120 --> 01:48.640
 they're not free goes against everything science should stand for, which is the free dissemination

01:48.640 --> 01:56.560
 of ideas that educate and inspire. Science cannot be a gated institution. The more people can freely

01:56.560 --> 02:02.160
 learn and collaborate on ideas, the more problems we can solve in the world together, and the faster

02:02.160 --> 02:10.320
 we can drive old ideas out and bring new, better ideas in. Science is beautiful and powerful, and

02:10.320 --> 02:17.680
 its dissemination in this digital age should be free. This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here's

02:17.680 --> 02:26.720
 my conversation with Luis and Joao Batala. Luis, you suggested an interesting idea. Imagine if most

02:26.720 --> 02:34.800
 papers had a backstory section, the same way that they have an abstract. So knowing more about how

02:34.800 --> 02:40.240
 the authors ended up working on a paper can be extremely insightful. And then you went on to give

02:40.240 --> 02:45.200
 a backstory for the Feynman QED paper. This is all in a tweet, by the way. We're doing tweet analysis

02:45.200 --> 02:51.600
 today. How much of the human backstory do you think is important in understanding the idea itself

02:51.600 --> 02:57.760
 that's presented in the paper or in general? I think this gives way more context to the work of

02:57.760 --> 03:03.600
 scientists. I think people, a lot of people have this almost kind of romantic misconception that

03:03.600 --> 03:09.600
 the way a lot of scientists work is almost as the sum of eureka moments where all of a sudden they

03:09.600 --> 03:15.200
 sit down and start writing two papers in a row, and the papers are usually isolated. And when you

03:15.200 --> 03:23.760
 actually look at it, the papers are chapters of a way more complex story. And the Feynman QED paper

03:23.760 --> 03:29.040
 is a good example. So Feynman was actually going through a pretty dark phase before writing that

03:29.040 --> 03:35.680
 paper. He lost enthusiasm with physics and doing physics problems. And there was one time when he

03:35.680 --> 03:41.840
 was in the cafeteria of Cornell, and he saw a guy that was throwing plates in the air. And he noticed

03:41.840 --> 03:47.200
 that when the plate was in the air, there were two movements there. The plate was wobbling, but he

03:47.200 --> 03:52.640
 also noticed that the Cornell symbol was rotating. And he was able to figure out the equations of

03:52.640 --> 04:03.040
 motions of those plates. And that led him to kind of think a little bit about electron orbits in

04:03.040 --> 04:11.120
 relativity, which led to the paper about quantum electrodynamics. So that kind of reignited his

04:11.120 --> 04:18.560
 interest in physics and ended up publishing the paper that led to his Nobel Prize, basically.

04:18.560 --> 04:24.560
 And I think there are a lot of really interesting backstories about papers that readers never get to

04:24.560 --> 04:33.120
 know. For instance, we did a couple of months ago an AMA around a paper, a pretty famous paper,

04:33.120 --> 04:38.960
 the GAMS paper with Ian Goodfellow. And so we did an AMA where everyone could ask questions about

04:38.960 --> 04:44.640
 the paper, and Ian was responding to those questions. And he was also telling the story of

04:44.640 --> 04:50.720
 how he got the idea for that paper in a bar. So that was also an interesting backstory. I also

04:50.720 --> 04:59.040
 read a book by Cedric Villani. Cedric Villani is this mathematician, a Fields Medalist. And in his

04:59.040 --> 05:05.760
 book, he tries to explain how he got from a PhD student to the Fields Medal. And he tries to be

05:05.760 --> 05:11.360
 as descriptive as possible, every single step, how he got to the Fields Medal. And it's interesting

05:11.360 --> 05:16.800
 also to see just the amount of random interactions and discussions with other researchers, sometimes

05:16.800 --> 05:22.160
 over coffee, and how it led to like fundamental breakthroughs and some of his most important

05:22.160 --> 05:25.920
 papers. So I think it's super interesting to have that context of the backstory.

05:25.920 --> 05:29.600
 Well, the Ian Goodfellow story is kind of interesting, and perhaps that's true for

05:29.600 --> 05:35.600
 Feynman as well. I don't know if it's romanticizing the thing, but it seems like just a few little

05:35.600 --> 05:41.840
 insights and a little bit of work does most of the leap required. Do you have a sense that for a lot

05:41.840 --> 05:49.200
 of the stuff you've looked at, just looking back through history, it wasn't necessarily the grind

05:49.920 --> 05:55.760
 of like Andrew Wiles or the Fermat's Last Theorem, for example. It was more like a brilliant moment

05:55.760 --> 06:02.640
 of insight. In fact, Ian Goodfellow has a kind of sadness to him almost, in that at that time in

06:02.640 --> 06:10.480
 machine learning, like at that time, especially for GANs, you could code something up really

06:10.480 --> 06:18.000
 quickly in a single machine and almost do the invention, go from idea to experimental validation

06:18.000 --> 06:22.800
 in like a single night, a single person could do it. And now there's kind of a sadness that a lot

06:22.800 --> 06:27.440
 of the breakthroughs you might have in machine learning kind of require large scale experiments.

06:27.440 --> 06:35.040
 So it was almost like the early days. So I wonder how many low hanging fruit there are

06:35.040 --> 06:41.920
 in science and mathematics and even engineering where it's like you could do that little experiment

06:41.920 --> 06:46.560
 quickly, like you have an insight in a bar. Why is it always a bar? But you have an insight at a bar

06:46.560 --> 06:53.600
 and then just implement and the world changes. It's a good point. I think it also depends a lot

06:53.600 --> 06:59.680
 on the maturity of the field. When you look at a field like mathematics, like it's a pretty mature

06:59.680 --> 07:07.040
 field, a field like machine learning, it's growing pretty fast. And it's actually pretty

07:07.040 --> 07:14.880
 interesting. I looked up like the number of new papers on archive with the keyword machine learning

07:14.880 --> 07:20.960
 and like 50% of those papers have been published in the last 12 months. So you can see just the

07:20.960 --> 07:29.680
 5.0, 50%. So you can see the magnitude of growth in that field. And so I think like as fields

07:29.680 --> 07:37.280
 mature, like those types of moments, I think naturally are less frequent. It's just a consequence

07:37.280 --> 07:42.560
 of that. The other point that is interesting about the backstory is that it can really make it

07:42.560 --> 07:47.680
 more memorable in a way. And by making it more memorable, it kind of sediments the knowledge

07:47.680 --> 07:54.800
 more in your mind. I remember also reading the sort of the backstory to Dijkstra's shortest path

07:54.800 --> 08:03.440
 algorithm. He came up with it essentially while he was sitting down at a coffee shop in Amsterdam.

08:03.440 --> 08:09.120
 And he came up with that algorithm over 20 minutes. And one interesting aspect is he didn't have any

08:09.120 --> 08:13.600
 pen or paper at the time. And so he had to do it all in his mind. And so there's only so much

08:13.600 --> 08:18.160
 complexity that he can handle if you're just thinking about it in your mind. And that like

08:18.160 --> 08:24.720
 when you think about the simplicity of Dijkstra's shortest path finding algorithm, it's knowing that

08:24.720 --> 08:30.080
 backstory helps sediment that algorithm in your mind so that you don't forget about it as easily.

08:30.080 --> 08:38.240
 It might be from you that I saw a meme about Dijkstra. It's like he's trying to solve it and

08:38.240 --> 08:45.680
 he comes up with some kind of random path. And then it's like my parents aren't home. And then

08:45.680 --> 08:53.840
 he does. He figures out the algorithm for the shortest path. He tried through words to convey

08:53.840 --> 08:59.840
 memes, but it's hilarious. I don't know if it's in post that we construct stories that romanticize

08:59.840 --> 09:05.440
 it. Apparently with Newton, there was no apple. Especially when you're working on problems that

09:05.440 --> 09:11.280
 have a physical manifestation or a visual manifestation, it feels like the world

09:12.240 --> 09:19.520
 could be an inspiration to you. So it doesn't have to be completely on paper. Like you could

09:19.520 --> 09:25.360
 be sitting at a bar and all of a sudden see something and a pattern will spark another

09:25.360 --> 09:31.200
 pattern and you can visualize it and rethink a problem in a particular way. Of course, you can

09:31.200 --> 09:35.440
 also load the math that you have on paper and always carry that with you. So when you show up to

09:35.440 --> 09:40.320
 the bar, some little inspiration could be the thing that changes it. Is there any other people

09:41.360 --> 09:44.640
 almost on the human side, whether it's physics with Feynman,

09:45.920 --> 09:51.680
 Dirac, Einstein, or computer science, Turing, anybody else? Any backstories that you remember

09:51.680 --> 09:58.160
 that jump out? Because I'm also referring to not necessarily these stories where something magical

09:58.160 --> 10:04.640
 happens, but these are personalities. They have big egos. Some of them are super friendly. Some of

10:04.640 --> 10:11.360
 them are like self obsessed. Some of them have anger issues. Some of them, how do I describe

10:11.360 --> 10:19.040
 Feynman? But he appears to have a appreciation of the beautiful in all its forms. He has a wit

10:19.040 --> 10:24.400
 and a cleverness and a humor about him. So does that come into play in terms of the construction

10:24.400 --> 10:29.600
 of the science? Well, I think you brought up Newton. Newton is a good example also to think

10:29.600 --> 10:35.200
 about his backstory because there's a certain backstory of Newton that people always talk about,

10:35.200 --> 10:41.120
 but then there's a whole another aspect of him that is also a big part of the person that he was,

10:41.120 --> 10:48.000
 but he was really into alchemy and that he spent a lot of time thinking about that and writing

10:48.000 --> 10:53.040
 about it and he took it very seriously. He was really into Bible interpretation, trying to

10:53.040 --> 10:58.080
 predict things based on the Bible. And so there's also a whole backstory then and of course you need

10:58.080 --> 11:06.320
 to look at it in the context and the time that when Newton lived, but it adds to his personality

11:06.320 --> 11:12.960
 and it's important to also understand those aspects that maybe people are not as proud to

11:12.960 --> 11:18.320
 teach to little kids, but it's important. It was part of who he was and maybe without those,

11:18.320 --> 11:23.360
 who knows what he would have done otherwise. Well, the cool thing about alchemy,

11:24.320 --> 11:29.280
 I don't know how it was viewed at the time, but it almost like to me symbolizes

11:30.480 --> 11:36.320
 dreaming of the impossible. Like most of the breakthrough ideas kind of seem impossible

11:36.320 --> 11:40.960
 until they're actually done. It's like achieving human flight. It's not completely obvious to me

11:40.960 --> 11:48.160
 that alchemy is impossible or putting myself in the mindset of the time. And perhaps even still,

11:49.200 --> 11:55.680
 everything that some of the most incredible breakthroughs would seem impossible.

11:56.560 --> 12:04.880
 And I wonder the value of believing, almost like focusing and dreaming of the impossible,

12:04.880 --> 12:09.200
 such that it actually is possible in your mind and that in itself manifests

12:09.200 --> 12:14.720
 whether the accomplishing that goal or making progress in some unexpected direction.

12:14.720 --> 12:19.920
 So alchemy almost symbolizes that for me. I distinctly remember having the same thought

12:19.920 --> 12:24.000
 of thinking, when I learned about atoms and that they have protons and electrons,

12:24.000 --> 12:28.320
 I was like, okay, to make gold, you just take whatever has an atomic weight below it and then

12:28.320 --> 12:32.880
 shove another proton in there and then you have a bunch of gold. So like, why don't people do that?

12:33.440 --> 12:37.840
 It seemed like conceptually is like, this sounds feasible. You might be able to do it,

12:37.840 --> 12:41.760
 you might be able to do it. And you can actually, it's just very, very expensive.

12:41.760 --> 12:48.560
 Yeah, exactly. So in a sense we do have alchemy and maybe even back then it wasn't as crazy that

12:48.560 --> 12:54.720
 he was so into it, but people just don't like to talk about that as much. But Newton in general

12:54.720 --> 13:01.760
 was a very interesting fellow. Anybody else come to mind? In terms of people that inspire you,

13:01.760 --> 13:07.840
 in terms of people that you just are happy that they have once or still exist on this earth?

13:08.720 --> 13:11.360
 I think, I mean, Freeman Dyson for me.

13:12.080 --> 13:17.840
 Yeah, Freeman Dyson was, I've had a chance to actually exchange a couple of emails with him.

13:17.840 --> 13:23.200
 It was probably one of the most humble scientists that I've ever met. And that had a big impact

13:23.200 --> 13:29.600
 on me. We were trying, we're actually trying to convince him to annotate a paper on Fermat's

13:29.600 --> 13:37.120
 library. And I sent him an email asking him if he could annotate a paper. And his response was

13:37.120 --> 13:42.400
 something like, I have very limited knowledge. I just know a couple of things about certain fields.

13:42.400 --> 13:48.880
 I'm not sure if I'm qualified to do that. That was his first response. And this was someone that

13:48.880 --> 13:53.360
 should have won an Obel prize and worked on a bunch of different fields, did some really,

13:53.360 --> 13:59.520
 really great work. And then just the interactions that I had with him, every time I asked him a

13:59.520 --> 14:05.520
 couple of questions about his papers, and he always responded saying, I'm not here to answer

14:05.520 --> 14:13.120
 your questions. I just want to open more questions. And so that had a big impact on me. It was like

14:13.120 --> 14:21.920
 just an example of an extremely humble, yet accomplished scientist. And Feynman was also

14:21.920 --> 14:29.280
 a big, big inspiration in the sense that he was able to be, again, extremely talented and scientist,

14:29.280 --> 14:34.960
 but at the same time, socially, he was able to, he was also really smart from a social perspective.

14:35.520 --> 14:42.400
 And he was able to interact with people. He was also a really good teacher and was also to did

14:43.040 --> 14:49.760
 awesome work in terms of explaining physics to the masses and motivating and getting people

14:49.760 --> 14:53.680
 interested in physics. And that for me was, was also a big inspiration.

14:54.640 --> 14:57.920
 Yeah. I liked the childlike curiosity of some of those folks that you mentioned,

14:57.920 --> 15:03.440
 Feynman. I've, Daniel Kahneman, I got a chance to meet and interact with some of these truly

15:03.440 --> 15:10.880
 special scientists. What makes them special is that even in older age, there's still like,

15:10.880 --> 15:17.440
 there's still that fire of childlike curiosity that burns. And some of that is like not taking

15:17.440 --> 15:21.760
 yourself so seriously that you think you've figured it all out, but almost like thinking that

15:21.760 --> 15:31.680
 you don't know much of it. And that's like step one in having a great conversation or collaboration

15:31.680 --> 15:37.280
 or exploring a scientific question. And it's cool how the very thing that probably earned people

15:37.280 --> 15:45.440
 the Nobel prize or, or work that's seminal in some way is the very thing that still burns even after

15:45.440 --> 15:50.000
 they've won the prize. It's cool to see. And they're rare humans, it seems.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.560
 And to that point, I remember like the last email that I sent to Freeman Dyson was like in his last

15:54.560 --> 16:00.800
 birthday, he was really into number theory and primes. So what I did is I took like a photo of

16:00.800 --> 16:07.680
 him picture, and then I turned that into like a giant prime number. So I converted the picture

16:07.680 --> 16:13.040
 into a bunch of one and eights. And then I moved some numbers around until it was a prime. And

16:13.040 --> 16:18.320
 then I sent him that. Oh, so the, the visual, like it's still look like the picture, it's made up of

16:18.320 --> 16:24.400
 a prime. That's tricky to do. It's hard to do. It looks harder than it actually is. So the way you

16:24.400 --> 16:29.600
 do it is like you convert the darker regions into eights and the lighter regions in ones.

16:30.160 --> 16:35.760
 And then there's... And then just keep flipping numbers until... But there's like some primality

16:35.760 --> 16:41.520
 tests that are cheaper from a computational standpoint. But what it gives you is like

16:41.520 --> 16:46.080
 it excludes numbers that are not prime. Then you end up with a set of numbers that you don't know

16:46.080 --> 16:50.880
 if they are prime or not. And then you run the full primality test on that. So you just have to

16:50.880 --> 16:55.280
 keep iterating on that. And it was, it's funny because when you got the picture, it was like,

16:55.280 --> 17:00.240
 how did you do that? It was super curious too. And then we got into the details. And again,

17:00.240 --> 17:06.000
 this was, it was already 90, I think 92 or something. And that curiosity was still there.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.520
 So you can really see that in some of these scientists.

17:10.080 --> 17:11.920
 So could we talk about Fermat's library?

17:12.880 --> 17:13.920
 Yeah, absolutely.

17:13.920 --> 17:18.080
 What is it? What's the main goal? What's the dream?

17:18.640 --> 17:24.160
 It is a platform for annotating papers in its essence, right? And so academic papers can be

17:24.160 --> 17:31.200
 one of the densest forms of content out there and generally pretty hard to understand at times. And

17:31.200 --> 17:36.400
 the idea is that you can make them more accessible and easier to understand by adding these rich

17:36.400 --> 17:41.200
 annotations to the site, right? And so we can just imagine a PDF view on your browser, and then you

17:41.200 --> 17:45.360
 have annotations on each side. And then when you click on them, a sidebar expands and then you have

17:46.240 --> 17:51.760
 annotations that support LaTeX and Markdown. And so the idea is that you can, say, explain a

17:51.760 --> 17:56.560
 tougher part of a paper where there's a step that is not completely obvious. And then you can

17:56.560 --> 18:04.560
 add more context to it. And then over time, papers can become easier and easier to understand and can

18:04.560 --> 18:11.920
 evolve in a way. But it really came from myself, Luis, and two other friends. We've had this

18:11.920 --> 18:17.040
 long running habit of kind of running a journal club amongst us. We come from different backgrounds,

18:17.040 --> 18:21.600
 right? I studied CS, we studied physics. And so we'd read papers and present them to the

18:21.600 --> 18:30.320
 each other. And then we tried to bring some of that online. And that's when we decided to

18:30.320 --> 18:39.120
 build Fermat's library. And then over time, it kind of grew into something with a broader goal.

18:40.480 --> 18:46.160
 And really, what we're trying to do is trying to help move science in the right direction.

18:46.160 --> 18:52.880
 That's really the ultimate goal and where we want to take it now.

18:52.880 --> 18:56.960
 Well, so there's a lot to be said. So first of all, for people who haven't seen it,

18:58.160 --> 19:02.960
 the interface is exceptionally well done. Execution is really important here.

19:02.960 --> 19:03.760
 Absolutely.

19:03.760 --> 19:10.000
 The other thing is just to mention for a large number of people, apparently, which is new to me,

19:10.000 --> 19:16.640
 don't know what LaTeX is. So it's spelled like LaTeX. So be careful googling it if you haven't

19:16.640 --> 19:21.600
 before. It's a, sorry, I don't even know the correct terminology.

19:21.600 --> 19:22.320
 Type setting language?

19:22.320 --> 19:28.400
 It's a type setting language where you're basically program, writing a program that

19:28.400 --> 19:34.160
 then generates something that looks, from a typography perspective, beautiful.

19:34.160 --> 19:34.880
 Absolutely.

19:34.880 --> 19:41.600
 And so a lot of academics use it to write papers. I think there's like a bunch of communities that

19:41.600 --> 19:46.240
 use it to write papers. I would say it's mathematics, physics, computer science.

19:47.120 --> 19:47.520
 Yeah.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.440
 That's, yeah, that's the main.

19:49.440 --> 19:54.400
 Because I'm collaborating currently on a paper with two neuroscientists from Stanford.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.440
 And they don't know LaTeX.

19:55.440 --> 20:04.640
 So I'm using Microsoft Word and Mendeley, and like all of those kinds of things. And I'm being

20:04.640 --> 20:10.720
 very zen like about the whole process, but it's fascinating. It's a little heartbreaking actually,

20:11.680 --> 20:18.480
 because it actually, it's funny to say, but, and we'll talk about open science, actually,

20:18.480 --> 20:20.800
 the bigger mission behind Fermat's library is like,

20:20.800 --> 20:28.480
 really opening up the world of science to everybody. Is these silly two facts of like

20:28.480 --> 20:35.200
 one community uses LaTeX and another uses Word, is actually a barrier between them.

20:35.840 --> 20:40.560
 That's like, it's like boring and practical in a sense, but it makes it very difficult to collaborate.

20:41.360 --> 20:46.000
 Just on that, like, I think there are some people that should have received like a Nobel

20:46.000 --> 20:51.120
 Prize, but will never get it. And I think one of those is like Donald Knuth, because of tech

20:51.120 --> 20:57.680
 and LaTeX. And then, because it had a huge impact in terms of like just making it easier for

20:57.680 --> 21:02.880
 researchers to put their content out there, like making it uniform as much as possible.

21:02.880 --> 21:05.040
 Oh, you mean like a Nobel Peace Prize?

21:05.040 --> 21:12.240
 Maybe a Nobel Peace Prize. Maybe a Nobel Peace Prize. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know.

21:12.240 --> 21:17.120
 Maybe a Nobel Peace Prize. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think so.

21:17.120 --> 21:21.840
 I mean, he at a very young age, got the Turing Award for his work in algorithms and so on. So

21:21.840 --> 21:27.760
 like an incredibly, I think it's in, it might be even the sixties, but I think it's the seventies.

21:27.760 --> 21:33.360
 So when he was really young and then he went on to do like incredible work with his book

21:33.360 --> 21:36.400
 and yeah, with tech that people don't know.

21:36.400 --> 21:41.760
 And going back just on the reason why we ended up, because I think this is interesting. The reason

21:41.760 --> 21:47.760
 why we ended up using the name Fermat's Library, this was because of Fermat's Last Theorem. And

21:47.760 --> 21:53.680
 Fermat's Last Theorem is actually a funny story. So Pierre de Fermat, he was like a lawyer and he

21:54.400 --> 22:01.760
 wrote like on a book that he had a solution to Fermat's Last Theorem, which, but that didn't

22:01.760 --> 22:08.720
 fit the margin of that book. And so Fermat's Last Theorem basically states that there's no solution.

22:08.720 --> 22:14.480
 If you have integers a, b and c, there's no solution to a to the power of n plus b to the

22:14.480 --> 22:21.920
 power of n equals to c to the power of n, if n is bigger than two. So there's no solutions.

22:21.920 --> 22:30.560
 And he said that, and that problem remained open for almost 300 years, I believe. And a lot of the

22:30.560 --> 22:35.680
 most famous mathematicians tried to tackle that problem. No one was able to figure that out until

22:35.680 --> 22:42.160
 Andrew Wiles, I think was in the 90s, was able to publish the solution, which was, I believe, almost

22:42.160 --> 22:49.360
 300 pages long. And so it's kind of an anecdote that, you know, there's a lot of knowledge and

22:50.000 --> 22:55.760
 insights that can be trapped in the margins. And there's a lot of potential energy that you can

22:55.760 --> 23:03.920
 release if you actually spend some time trying to digest that. And that was the origin story for

23:03.920 --> 23:09.840
 for the name. Yes, you can share the contents of the margins with the world that could inspire

23:09.840 --> 23:15.680
 a solution or a communication that then leads to a solution. And if you think about papers,

23:15.680 --> 23:21.600
 like papers are, as Joan was saying, probably one of the densest pieces of text that any human can

23:21.600 --> 23:27.200
 read. And you have these researchers, like some of the brightest minds in these fields, working on

23:27.200 --> 23:32.480
 like new discoveries and publishing these work on journals that are imposing them restrictions in

23:32.480 --> 23:38.160
 terms of the number of pages that they can have to explain a new scientific breakthrough. So at the

23:38.160 --> 23:45.840
 end of the day, papers are not optimized for clarity and for a proper explanation of that

23:45.840 --> 23:50.320
 content because there are so many restrictions. So there's, as I mentioned, there's a lot of

23:50.320 --> 23:57.040
 potential energy that can be freed if you actually try to digest a lot of the contents of papers.

23:57.040 --> 24:02.240
 Trey Lockerbie Can you explain some of the other things? So margins, librarian, journal club?

24:02.240 --> 24:06.880
 Ofer Yusuf So journal club is what a lot of people know us for, where we every week,

24:06.880 --> 24:11.760
 we release an annotated paper and in all sorts of different fields, but physics, CS, math,

24:12.480 --> 24:16.960
 margins is kind of the same software that we use to run the journal club and to

24:16.960 --> 24:22.240
 host the annotations. But we've made that available for free to anybody that wants to use it. And so

24:22.240 --> 24:29.280
 folks use it at universities and for running journal clubs. And so we've just made that freely

24:29.280 --> 24:34.400
 available. And then librarian is a browser extension that we developed that is sort of an

24:34.400 --> 24:40.720
 overlay on top of archive. So it's about bringing some of the same functionality around comments,

24:40.720 --> 24:48.320
 plus adding some extra niceties to archive, like being able to very easily extract the references

24:48.320 --> 24:52.560
 of a paper that you're looking at or being able to extract the bib deck in order to cite that

24:52.560 --> 24:57.280
 paper yourself. So it's an overlay on top of archive. The idea is that you can have that

24:57.280 --> 25:01.760
 commenting interface without having to leave archive. Trey Lockerbie It's kind of incredible.

25:01.760 --> 25:10.240
 I didn't know about it. And once I learned of it, it's like, holy shit. Why isn't it more popular,

25:10.240 --> 25:14.880
 given how popular archive is? Like everybody should be using it. Archive sucks in terms of

25:14.880 --> 25:19.920
 its interface. Let me rephrase that. It's limited in terms of its interface.

25:19.920 --> 25:29.120
 Archive is a pretty incredible project. And it is, in a way, the growth has been completely

25:29.120 --> 25:34.560
 linear over time. If you look at the number of papers published on archive, it's pretty much

25:34.560 --> 25:40.400
 a straight line for the past 20 years. Especially if you're coming from a startup background and

25:40.400 --> 25:47.200
 then you were trying to do archive, you'd probably try all sorts of growth acts and try to then maybe

25:47.200 --> 25:53.120
 have paid features and things like that. And that would kind of maybe ruin it. And so there's a

25:53.120 --> 25:57.760
 subtle balance there. And I don't know what aspects you can change about it.

25:57.760 --> 26:04.400
 For some tools in science, it just takes time for them to grow. Archive has just turned 30,

26:04.400 --> 26:09.120
 I believe. And for people that don't know, archive is these kind of online repositories

26:09.120 --> 26:15.440
 where people put preprints, which are versions of the papers, before they actually make it to journals.

26:15.440 --> 26:23.120
 A R X I V, for people who don't know. And it's actually a really vibrant place to publish your

26:23.120 --> 26:29.360
 papers in the aforementioned communities of mathematics, physics, and computer science.

26:29.360 --> 26:34.800
 It started with mathematics and physics, and then over the last 30 years, it evolved. And now,

26:34.800 --> 26:40.640
 actually computer science now, it's a more popular category than physics and math on archive.

26:40.640 --> 26:46.160
 And there's also, which I don't know very much about, like a biology, medical version of that.

26:46.160 --> 26:54.160
 Bioarchive. Yeah, bioarchive. It's interesting because if you look at these platforms for

26:54.160 --> 27:01.360
 preprints, they actually play a super important role. Because if you look at a category like math,

27:01.360 --> 27:08.880
 for some papers in math, it might take close to three years after you click upload paper on the

27:08.880 --> 27:14.240
 journal website, and the paper gets published on the website of the journal. So this is literally

27:14.240 --> 27:24.080
 the longest upload period on the internet. And during those three years, their content is just

27:24.720 --> 27:29.920
 locked. And so that's why it's so important for people to have websites that are open to

27:29.920 --> 27:35.200
 people to have websites like archive so that you can share that before it goes to the journal

27:35.200 --> 27:40.640
 with the rest of the world. There was actually on archive that Perelman published the three

27:40.640 --> 27:45.760
 papers that led to the proof of the Poincare conjecture. And then you have other fields like

27:46.640 --> 27:52.320
 machine learning, for instance, where the field is evolving at such a high rate that people don't

27:52.320 --> 27:57.520
 even wait before the papers go to journals before they start working on top of those papers. So they

27:57.520 --> 28:02.240
 publish them on archive, then other people see them, they start working on that. And archive did

28:02.240 --> 28:07.840
 a really good job at building that core platform to host papers. But I think there's a really,

28:07.840 --> 28:13.040
 really big opportunity in building more features on top of that platform, apart from just hosting

28:13.040 --> 28:19.440
 papers. So collaboration, annotations, and having other things apart from papers like code

28:20.880 --> 28:24.960
 and other things. Because, for instance, in the field like machine learning,

28:24.960 --> 28:29.920
 there's a really big, as I mentioned, people start working on top of preprints, and they are

28:29.920 --> 28:38.000
 assuming that preprint is correct. But you really need a way, for instance, to maybe, it's not peer

28:38.000 --> 28:44.320
 review, but distinguish what is good work from bad work on archive. How do you do that? So like

28:44.320 --> 28:50.960
 a commenting interface like librarian, it's useful for that so that you can distinguish that in a

28:50.960 --> 28:56.400
 field that is growing so fast as machine learning. And then you have platforms that focus, for

28:56.400 --> 29:02.960
 instance, on just biology. BioArchive is a good example. BioArchive is also super interesting

29:02.960 --> 29:11.200
 because there's actually an interesting experiment that was run in the 60s. So in the 60s, the NIH

29:12.400 --> 29:19.680
 supported this experiment called the Information Exchange Group, which at the time was a way for

29:19.680 --> 29:27.280
 researchers to share biology preprints via mail or using libraries. And that project in the 1960s

29:27.280 --> 29:32.880
 got canceled six years after it started. And it was due to intense pressure from the journals

29:32.880 --> 29:41.360
 to kill that project because they were fearing competition from the preprints for the journal

29:41.360 --> 29:50.400
 industry. Crick was one of the famous scientists that opposed to the Information Exchange Group.

29:50.400 --> 29:55.920
 And it's interesting because right now, if you analyze the number of biology papers that appear

29:55.920 --> 30:03.520
 first as preprints, it's only 2% of the papers. And this was almost 50 years after that first

30:03.520 --> 30:08.960
 experiment. So you can see that pressure from the journals to cancel that initial version of a

30:08.960 --> 30:15.840
 preprint repo had a tremendous impact on the number of papers that are showing up in biology

30:15.840 --> 30:24.000
 as preprints. So it delayed a lot that revolution. But now platforms like BioArchive are doing that

30:24.000 --> 30:28.240
 work. But there's still a lot of room for growth there. And I think it's super important because

30:28.240 --> 30:33.520
 those are the papers that are open that everyone can read. Okay. But if we just look at the entire

30:33.520 --> 30:40.720
 process of science as a big system, can we just talk about how it can be revolutionized? So you

30:40.720 --> 30:46.960
 have an idea, depending on the field, you want to make that idea concrete, you want to run a few

30:46.960 --> 30:53.920
 experiments in computer science, there might be some code, there'd be a data set for, you know,

30:53.920 --> 31:02.240
 some of the more sort of biology, psychology, you might be collecting the data set that's called,

31:02.240 --> 31:07.920
 you know, a study, right? So that's part of that, that's part of the methodology.

31:08.480 --> 31:16.640
 And so you are putting all that into a paper form. And then you have some results. And then you

31:16.640 --> 31:23.760
 submit that to a place for review through the peer review process. And there's a process where,

31:23.760 --> 31:28.960
 how would you summarize the peer review process? But it's really just like a handful of people look

31:28.960 --> 31:34.640
 over your paper and comment. And based on that, decide whether your paper is good or not. So

31:34.640 --> 31:40.480
 there's a whole broken nature to it. At the same time, I love the peer review process when I buy

31:40.480 --> 31:48.480
 stuff on Amazon, like for like the commenting system, whatever that is. So, okay. So there's

31:48.480 --> 31:53.120
 a bunch of possibilities for revolutions there. And then there's the other side, which is the

31:53.120 --> 31:58.720
 collaborative aspect of the science, which is people annotating, people commenting, sort of the

31:58.720 --> 32:04.400
 low effort collaboration, which is a comment. Sometimes, as you've talked about, a comment can

32:04.400 --> 32:10.320
 change everything. But, you know, or a higher effort collaboration, like more like maybe

32:10.320 --> 32:17.280
 annotations, or even like contributing to the paper, you can think of like, collaborative

32:17.280 --> 32:24.800
 updating of the paper over time. So there's all these possibilities for doing things better than

32:24.800 --> 32:31.040
 they've been done. Can we talk about some ideas in this space? Some ideas that you're working on,

32:31.040 --> 32:36.320
 some ideas that you're not yet working on, but should be revolutionized? Because it does seem

32:37.120 --> 32:44.640
 that archive and like open review, for example, are like the craigslist of science. Like,

32:45.360 --> 32:53.040
 like, yeah, okay. I'm very grateful that we have it. But it just feels like, it's like 10 to 20

32:53.040 --> 32:58.240
 years. Like, it doesn't feel like that's a feature. The simplicity of it is a feature. It feels like

32:58.240 --> 33:07.200
 it's a, it's a bug. But then again, the pushback there is Wikipedia has the same kind of simplicity

33:07.200 --> 33:14.320
 to it. And it seems to work exceptionally well in the crowdsourcing aspect of it. So I'm sorry,

33:14.320 --> 33:19.360
 there's a bunch of stuff going on on the table. Let's just pick random things that we can talk

33:19.360 --> 33:24.640
 about. Wikipedia, you know, for me, it's the cosmological constant of the internet. It's,

33:24.640 --> 33:29.280
 I think we are lucky to live in the parallel universe where Wikipedia exists. Yes. Because

33:29.280 --> 33:35.360
 if someone had pitched me Wikipedia, like a publicly edited encyclopedia, like a couple of

33:35.360 --> 33:40.000
 years ago, like it would be, I don't know how many people would have said that that would have

33:40.640 --> 33:45.520
 survived. I mean, it makes almost no sense. It's like having a Google doc that everybody on the

33:45.520 --> 33:51.120
 internet can edit. And like, that will be like the most reliable source for knowledge. And I don't

33:51.120 --> 33:58.240
 know how many, but hundreds of thousands of topics. Yeah. It's insane. It's insane. And like you have,

33:58.240 --> 34:03.920
 and then you have users, like there's one single user that edited one third of the articles on

34:03.920 --> 34:10.400
 Wikipedia. So we have these really, really big power users. There are a substantial part of like

34:10.400 --> 34:18.400
 what makes Wikipedia successful. And so like, no one would have ever imagined that that could

34:18.400 --> 34:24.400
 happen. And so that's one thing. I completely agree with what you just said. I also...

34:24.400 --> 34:28.880
 Sorry to interrupt briefly. Maybe let's inject that into the discussion of everything else.

34:29.920 --> 34:35.280
 I also believe, I've seen that with Stack Overflow, that one individual or a small collection of

34:35.280 --> 34:42.000
 individuals contribute or revolutionized most of the community. Like if you create a really

34:42.000 --> 34:50.960
 powerful system for archive or like open review and made it really easy and compelling and exciting

34:50.960 --> 34:57.840
 for one person who is like a 10x contributor to do their thing, that's going to change everything.

34:57.840 --> 35:02.240
 It seems like that was the mechanism that changed everything for Wikipedia. And that's the mechanism

35:02.240 --> 35:07.600
 that changed everything for Stack Overflow. Is gamifying or making it exciting or just making

35:07.600 --> 35:15.280
 it fun or pleasant or fulfilling in some way for those people who are insane enough to like answer

35:15.280 --> 35:21.920
 thousands of questions or write thousands of factoids and like research them and check them,

35:21.920 --> 35:25.040
 all those kinds of things, or read thousands of papers.

35:25.040 --> 35:31.360
 Yeah. No, Stack Overflow is another great example of that. And it's just, and those are both to

35:31.360 --> 35:38.720
 do incredibly productive communities that generate a ton of value and capture almost none of it.

35:38.720 --> 35:49.840
 Right. And it's in a way, it's almost like, it's very counterintuitive that these communities would

35:49.840 --> 35:57.760
 exist and thrive. And it's really hard to, there aren't that many communities like that.

35:57.760 --> 36:01.280
 Right. So how do we do that for science? Do you have ideas there?

36:01.280 --> 36:04.800
 Like what are the biggest problems that you see? You're working on some of them.

36:05.440 --> 36:09.120
 Like just on that, there are a couple of really interesting experiments that people are running.

36:09.120 --> 36:15.440
 An example would be like the Polymath projects. So this is a kind of a social experiment that was

36:16.400 --> 36:22.320
 created by Tim Gowers, Fields Medalist. And his idea was to try to prove that,

36:22.320 --> 36:29.440
 is it possible to do mathematics in a massively collaborative way on the internet? So he decided

36:29.440 --> 36:36.640
 to pick a couple of problems and test that. And they found out that it actually is possible for

36:36.640 --> 36:42.400
 specific types of problems, namely problems that you're able to break down in little pieces and

36:42.400 --> 36:48.240
 go step by step. You might need, as with open source, you might need people that are just kind

36:48.240 --> 36:55.200
 of reorganizing the house every once in a while. And then people throw a bunch of ideas and then

36:55.200 --> 36:59.520
 you make some progress, then you reorganize, you reframe the problem and you go step by step.

36:59.520 --> 37:07.520
 But they were actually able to prove that it is possible to collaborate online and do progress

37:07.520 --> 37:13.280
 in terms of mathematics. And so I'm confident that there are other avenues that could be

37:13.280 --> 37:16.720
 explored here. Can we talk about peer review, for example?

37:16.720 --> 37:23.360
 Absolutely. I think in terms of the peer review, I think it's important to look at the bigger

37:23.360 --> 37:32.480
 picture here of what the scientific publishing ecosystem looks like. Because for me, there are

37:32.480 --> 37:39.440
 a lot of things that are wrong about that entire process. So if you look at what publishing means

37:39.440 --> 37:48.240
 in a traditional journal, you have journals that pay authors for their articles, and then they might

37:48.240 --> 37:56.400
 pay reviewers to review those articles. And finally, they pay people or distributors to

37:56.400 --> 38:02.320
 distribute the content. In the scientific publishing world, you have scientists that are

38:02.320 --> 38:07.040
 usually backed by government grants. They are giving away their work for free in the form of

38:07.040 --> 38:13.680
 papers. And then you have other scientists that are reviewing their work. This process is known

38:13.680 --> 38:21.120
 as the peer review process, again for free. And then finally, we have government backed

38:21.120 --> 38:29.440
 universities and libraries that are buying back all that work so that other scientists can read.

38:29.440 --> 38:33.520
 So this is, for me, it's bizarre. You have the government that is funding the research,

38:33.520 --> 38:37.280
 it's paying the salaries of the scientists, it's paying the salaries of the reviewers,

38:37.280 --> 38:43.840
 and it's buying back all that product of their work again. And I think the problem with this

38:43.840 --> 38:52.480
 system and it's why it's so difficult to break this suboptimal equilibrium is because of the way

38:52.480 --> 38:59.840
 academia works right now and the way you can progress in your academic life. And so in a lot

38:59.840 --> 39:06.640
 of fields, the competition in academia is really insane. So you have hundreds of PhD students,

39:06.640 --> 39:15.040
 they are trying to get to a professor position and it's hyper competitive. And the only way for

39:15.040 --> 39:23.680
 you to get there is if you publish papers, ideally in journals with a high impact factor.

39:23.680 --> 39:28.160
 In computer science, it's often conferences are also very prestigious or actually more

39:28.160 --> 39:33.680
 prestigious than journals now. So that's the one discipline where, I mean, that has to do

39:33.680 --> 39:40.800
 with the thing we've discussed in terms of how quickly the field turns around. But like NeurIPS,

39:40.800 --> 39:46.880
 CVPR, those conferences are more prestigious, or at the very least as prestigious as the journals.

39:47.920 --> 39:49.840
 But it doesn't matter. The process is what it is.

39:51.840 --> 39:56.160
 So for people that don't know, the impact factor of a journal is basically the average number of

39:56.160 --> 40:02.960
 citations that a paper would get if it gets published on that journal. But so you can really

40:02.960 --> 40:11.040
 think that the problem with the impact factor is that it's a way to turn papers into accounting

40:11.040 --> 40:19.680
 units. And let me unpack this because the impact factor is almost like a nobility title. Because

40:19.680 --> 40:25.200
 papers are born with impact even before anyone reads them. So the researchers, they don't have

40:25.200 --> 40:32.240
 the incentive to care about if this paper is going to have a long term impact on the world.

40:32.240 --> 40:37.520
 What they care, their goal, their end goal is the paper to get published so that they get that

40:37.520 --> 40:43.760
 value upfront. So for me, that is one of the problems of that. And that really creates a

40:43.760 --> 40:49.440
 tyranny of metrics. Because at the end of the day, if you are a dean, what you want to hire is

40:49.440 --> 40:55.360
 people, researchers that publish papers on journals with high impact factors because that will

40:55.360 --> 40:59.920
 increase the ranking of your university and will allow you to charge more for tuition,

40:59.920 --> 41:06.800
 so on and so forth. And that, especially when you are in super competitive areas,

41:07.600 --> 41:14.880
 that people will try to gamify that system and misconduct starts showing up. There's a really

41:14.880 --> 41:21.600
 interesting book on this topic called Gaming the Metrics. It's a book by a researcher called Mario

41:21.600 --> 41:29.280
 Biagioli. It goes a lot into how the impact factor and metrics affect science negatively.

41:29.280 --> 41:34.800
 And it's interesting to think, especially in terms of citations, if you look at the early work of

41:34.800 --> 41:39.680
 looking at citations, there was a lot of work that was done by a guy called Eugene Garfield.

41:39.680 --> 41:46.800
 And this guy, the early work in terms of citation, they wanted to use citations from a descriptive

41:46.800 --> 41:52.960
 point of view. So what they wanted to create was a map. And that map would create a visual

41:52.960 --> 42:00.000
 representation of influence. So citations would be links between papers. And ideally, what they

42:00.000 --> 42:05.760
 would show, they would represent is that you read someone else's paper and it had an impact on your

42:05.760 --> 42:12.240
 research. They weren't supposed to be counted. I think this inspired Larry and Sergey's work for

42:12.240 --> 42:16.640
 Google. Exactly. I think they even mentioned that. But what happens is, as you start counting

42:16.640 --> 42:25.360
 citations, you create a market. And the work of Eugene Garfield was a big inspiration for Larry

42:25.360 --> 42:31.440
 and Sergey and for the PageRank algorithm that led to the creation of Google. And they even

42:31.440 --> 42:37.360
 recognized that. And if you think about it, it's like the same way there's a gigantic market for

42:37.360 --> 42:46.080
 search engine optimization, SEO, where people try to optimize the PageRank and how a web page will

42:46.080 --> 42:52.800
 rank on Google. The same will happen for papers. People will try to optimize the impact factors

42:52.800 --> 42:58.800
 and the citations that they get. And that creates a really big problem. And it's super interesting

42:58.800 --> 43:05.280
 to actually analyze them. If you look at the distribution of the impact factors of journals,

43:05.280 --> 43:11.600
 you have like Nature. Nature, I believe, is in the low 40s. And then you have, I believe, Science

43:11.600 --> 43:20.240
 is high 30s. And then you have a really good set of good journals that will fall between 10 and 30.

43:20.240 --> 43:26.880
 And then you have a gigantic tale of journals that have impact factor below 2. And you can really

43:26.880 --> 43:34.960
 see two economies here. You see the universities that are maybe less prestigious, less known,

43:35.840 --> 43:41.040
 where the faculty are pressured to just publish papers regardless of the journal. What I want to

43:41.040 --> 43:47.120
 do is increase the ranking of my university. And so they end up publishing as many papers as they

43:47.120 --> 43:53.440
 can in journals with low impact factor. And unfortunately, this represents a lot of the

43:53.440 --> 44:02.320
 global south. And then you have the luxury good economy. And there are also problems here in

44:02.320 --> 44:07.760
 the luxury good economy. So if you look at the journal like Nature, so with impact factor in

44:07.760 --> 44:14.800
 the low 40s, there's no way that you're going to be able to sustain that level of impact factor

44:14.800 --> 44:22.080
 by just grabbing the attention of scientists. What I mean by that is for the journals,

44:22.080 --> 44:29.280
 the articles that get published in Nature, they need to be New York Times grade. So they need to

44:29.280 --> 44:34.960
 make it to the big media. They need to be captured by the big media. And because that's the only way

44:34.960 --> 44:40.960
 for you to capture enough attention to sustain that level of citations. And that, of course,

44:40.960 --> 44:47.440
 creates problems because people then will try to, again, gamify the system and have like titles or

44:47.440 --> 44:55.760
 abstracts or that are bigger, make claims that are bigger than what is actually can be, you know,

44:55.760 --> 45:01.520
 sustained by the data or the content of the paper. And you'll have clickbait titles or clickbait

45:01.520 --> 45:10.320
 abstracts. And again, this is all a consequence of science or metrics. And this is a very dangerous

45:10.320 --> 45:16.240
 cycle that I think it's very hard to break, but it's happening in academia in a lot of fields

45:16.240 --> 45:21.120
 right now. Is it fundamentally the existence of metrics or the metrics just need to be

45:21.120 --> 45:28.080
 significantly improved? Because like I said, the metrics used for Amazon for purchasing,

45:29.200 --> 45:34.400
 I don't know, computer parts is pretty damn good in terms of selecting which are the good ones,

45:34.400 --> 45:42.880
 which are not. In that same way, if we had Amazon type of review system in the space of ideas,

45:42.880 --> 45:46.400
 in the space of science, it feels like that those metrics would be a little bit better.

45:47.280 --> 45:55.600
 Sort of when it's significantly more open to the crowdsource nature of the internet,

45:55.600 --> 46:01.840
 of the scientific internet, meaning as opposed to, like my biggest problem with peer review

46:02.400 --> 46:09.760
 has always been that it's like five, six, seven people, usually even less. And it's often,

46:09.760 --> 46:17.440
 nobody's incentivized to do a good job in the whole process. Meaning it's anonymous in a way

46:17.440 --> 46:26.960
 that doesn't incentivize, like doesn't gamify or incentivize great work. And also it doesn't

46:26.960 --> 46:36.400
 necessarily have to be anonymous. Like there has to be, the entire system is, doesn't encourage

46:36.400 --> 46:45.040
 actual sort of rigorous review. For example, like open review does kind of incentivize that kind of

46:45.040 --> 46:50.960
 process of collaborative review, but it's also imperfect. But it just feels like the thing that

46:50.960 --> 46:56.080
 Amazon has, which is like thousands of people contributing their reviews to a product,

46:58.080 --> 47:04.640
 it feels like that could be applied to science where the same kind of thing you're doing with

47:04.640 --> 47:11.120
 Fermat's library, but doing at a scale that's much larger. It feels like that should be possible

47:11.920 --> 47:17.440
 given the number of grad students, given the number of general public that's getting,

47:17.440 --> 47:24.320
 for example, I personally, as a person who got an education in mathematics and computer science,

47:24.320 --> 47:35.520
 like I can be a quote unquote, like reviewer on a lot bigger set of things than is my exact

47:36.160 --> 47:43.200
 expertise. If I'm one of thousands of reviewers, if I'm the only reviewer, one of five,

47:43.200 --> 47:48.880
 then I better be like an expert in the thing. But if I, and I've learned this with COVID,

47:48.880 --> 47:55.520
 which is like, you can just use your basic skills as a data analyst to contribute to

47:55.520 --> 48:00.640
 the review process and a particular little aspect of a paper and be able to comment, be able to

48:00.640 --> 48:07.200
 sort of draw in some references that challenge the ideas presented or to enrich the ideas that

48:07.200 --> 48:16.240
 are presented. It just feels like crowdsourcing the review process would be able to allow you to have

48:16.240 --> 48:22.640
 metrics in terms of how good a paper is that are much better representative of its actual impact

48:22.640 --> 48:29.040
 in the world, of its actual value to the world, as opposed to some kind of arbitrary, gamified

48:30.800 --> 48:36.880
 version of its impact. I agree with that. I think there's definitely the possibility,

48:36.880 --> 48:41.600
 at least for a more resilient system than what we have today. And I think that's kind of what

48:41.600 --> 48:48.560
 you're describing, Alex. I mean, to an extent, we kind of have like a little bit of a Heisenberg

48:48.560 --> 48:52.960
 uncertainty principle. When you pick a metric, as soon as you do it, then maybe it works as a good

48:52.960 --> 48:58.960
 heuristic for a short amount of time, but soon enough, people would start gamifying. But then

48:58.960 --> 49:03.760
 you can definitely have metrics that are more resilient to gamification and they'll work as a

49:03.760 --> 49:10.320
 better heuristic to try to push you in the best direction. But I guess down the line,

49:10.320 --> 49:15.840
 the underlying problem you're saying is there's a shortage of positions in academia. That's a big

49:15.840 --> 49:21.120
 problem for me. Yeah. And that, and so they're going to be constantly gamifying the metrics.

49:21.120 --> 49:26.640
 It's a bit of a zero sum game. It's a very competitive field. And that's what usually

49:26.640 --> 49:33.040
 happens in very competitive fields. Yeah. Yeah. But I think some of the peer review problems,

49:33.040 --> 49:37.600
 like scale helps, I think. And it's interesting to look at what you're mentioning, breaking it

49:37.600 --> 49:45.280
 down, maybe in like smaller parts and having more people jumping in. But this is definitely

49:45.280 --> 49:50.400
 a problem. And the peer review problem, as I mentioned, is correlated with the problem of

49:50.400 --> 49:55.840
 academic career progression. And it's all intertwined. And that's why I think it's so hard

49:55.840 --> 50:01.360
 to break it. There are a couple of really interesting things that are being done right

50:01.360 --> 50:06.080
 now. There are a couple of, for instance, journals that are overlay journals on top of

50:06.080 --> 50:12.000
 platforms like archive and bio archive that want to remove like the more traditional journals from

50:12.000 --> 50:19.280
 the equation. So essentially a journal is just a collection of links to papers. And what they're

50:19.280 --> 50:24.800
 trying to do is like removing that middleman and trying to make the review process a little bit

50:24.800 --> 50:33.840
 more transparent and not charging universities. There are a couple of more famous ones. There's

50:33.840 --> 50:39.120
 one discrete analysis in mathematics. There's one called the quantum journal, which we're actually

50:39.120 --> 50:43.760
 working with them. We have a partnership with them for the papers that get published in quantum

50:43.760 --> 50:48.640
 journal. They also get the annotations on formats and they're doing pretty well. They've been able

50:48.640 --> 50:53.520
 to grow substantially. The problem there is getting to critical mass. So it's again, convincing the

50:53.520 --> 50:59.440
 researchers and especially the young researchers that need that impact factor, need those

50:59.440 --> 51:05.760
 publications to have citations to not publish on the traditional journal and go on an open journal

51:05.760 --> 51:11.120
 and publish their work there. There, I think there are a couple of really high profile scientists of

51:11.120 --> 51:16.400
 people like Tim Gowers. They are trying to incentivize like famous scientists that already

51:16.400 --> 51:22.240
 have tenure and that don't need that to publish that to increase the reputation of those journals.

51:22.240 --> 51:27.280
 So that other maybe younger scientists can start publishing on those as well. And so that you can

51:27.280 --> 51:32.960
 try to break that vicious cycle of the more traditional journals.

51:32.960 --> 51:39.520
 I mean, another possible way to break this cycle is to like raise public awareness and just by

51:39.520 --> 51:47.680
 force, like ban paid journals. Like what exactly are they contributing to the world? Like basically

51:47.680 --> 51:55.280
 making it illegal to forget the fact that it's mostly federally funded. So that's that's

51:55.280 --> 52:03.760
 a super ugly picture too. But like, why should knowledge be so expensive? Like where everyone

52:03.760 --> 52:10.080
 is working for the public good. And then there's these gatekeepers that, you know, most people

52:10.080 --> 52:17.600
 can't read most papers without having to pay money. And that's, that doesn't make any sense.

52:17.600 --> 52:20.000
 That's like that, that should be illegal.

52:20.000 --> 52:23.280
 I mean, that's what you're saying is exactly right. I mean, for instance,

52:23.280 --> 52:28.880
 right, I went to school here in the US, we studied in Europe, and you would sit like you'd

52:28.880 --> 52:32.640
 ask me all the time to download papers and send it to him because he just couldn't get it. And like

52:32.640 --> 52:35.120
 papers that he needed for his research. And so,

52:35.120 --> 52:37.920
 But he's a student, like he's a grad student.

52:37.920 --> 52:42.000
 He was a grad student. But that, you know, I'm even referring to just regular people.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.240
 Oh, yeah. Okay. That too. Yeah.

52:44.240 --> 52:50.800
 And I think during 2020, because of COVID, a lot of journals put down the

52:50.800 --> 52:56.800
 walls for certain kind of coronavirus related papers. But like, that just gave me an indication

52:56.800 --> 53:03.200
 that like, this should be done for everything. It's absurd. Like people should be outraged

53:03.200 --> 53:09.120
 that there's these gates. Because, so the moment you dissolve the journals,

53:09.920 --> 53:16.400
 then there will be an opportunity for startups to build stuff on top of archive. It'd be an

53:16.400 --> 53:22.480
 opportunity for like, for my library to step up to scale up to something much even larger.

53:22.480 --> 53:28.240
 I mean, that was the original dream of Google, which I've always admired, which is make the

53:28.240 --> 53:33.200
 world's information accessible. Actually, it's interesting that Google hasn't, maybe you guys

53:33.200 --> 53:39.120
 can correct me, but they put together Google Scholar, which is incredible. But they, and they've

53:39.120 --> 53:47.040
 did the scanning of books, but they haven't really tried to make science accessible in the following

53:47.040 --> 53:54.400
 way. Like, besides doing Google Scholar, they haven't like delved into the papers, right?

53:54.400 --> 53:59.120
 Which is especially curious given what Luis was saying, right? That it's kind of in their genesis.

53:59.120 --> 54:04.000
 There's this, you know, research that was very connected with how papers reference each other

54:04.000 --> 54:09.360
 and like building a network out of that. Interestingly enough, like Google, I think there was a,

54:09.360 --> 54:14.320
 there was not intended, Google Plus was like the Google social network that got cancelled, was used

54:14.320 --> 54:19.600
 by a lot of researchers. Yes, it was. Which I think was just a, you know, side, kind of a side effect.

54:19.600 --> 54:23.360
 But then a lot of people ended up migrating to Twitter, but it was not on purpose. But yeah,

54:23.360 --> 54:29.360
 I agree with you. Like they haven't gone past Google Scholar and I don't know why. Well, that said,

54:29.360 --> 54:35.680
 Google Scholar is incredible. For people who are not familiar, it's one of the best aggregation of

54:35.680 --> 54:39.920
 all the scientific work that's out there and especially the network that connects to all of

54:39.920 --> 54:45.120
 them. What sites, what. And also trying to aggregate all of the versions of the papers that are

54:45.120 --> 54:50.560
 available there and trying to merge them in a way that one particular work, even though it's available

54:50.560 --> 54:56.720
 in a bunch of places, counts as, you know, like a central hub of what that work is, according to

54:56.720 --> 55:03.280
 multiple versions. But that almost seems like a fun pet project of a couple of engineers within

55:03.280 --> 55:09.520
 within Google, as opposed to a serious effort to make the world science accessible. But going back

55:09.520 --> 55:16.000
 to just the journals, when you're talking about that, Lex, I believe that in that front, I think

55:16.000 --> 55:23.200
 we might be past the event horizon. So I think the model, the business model for the journals,

55:23.200 --> 55:27.280
 you know, doesn't make sense. They're a middle layer that is not adding a lot of value. And you

55:27.280 --> 55:35.600
 see a lot of motions, whereas like in Europe, a lot of the papers that are funded by the European

55:35.600 --> 55:41.920
 Union, they will have to be open to the public. And I think there's a lot of... Bill Gates too,

55:41.920 --> 55:49.520
 like what the Gates Foundation funds, like the demand that it's accessible to everybody.

55:49.520 --> 55:55.200
 So I think it's a question of time before that wall kind of falls. And that is going to open a

55:55.200 --> 56:02.160
 lot of possibilities. Because, you know, imagine if you had like the layer of that gigantic layer

56:02.160 --> 56:08.880
 of papers all available online, you know, that unlocks a lot of potential as a platform for

56:08.880 --> 56:13.920
 people to build things on top of that. But to what you're saying, it is weird, like you can literally

56:13.920 --> 56:20.800
 go and listen to any song that was ever made on your phone, right? You open Spotify and you might

56:20.800 --> 56:24.960
 not even pay for it. You might be on the free version and you can listen to any song that was

56:24.960 --> 56:33.120
 ever made, pretty much. But there's like, you don't have access to a huge percentage of academic

56:33.120 --> 56:37.840
 papers, which is just like this fundamental knowledge that we're all funding. But you as an

56:37.840 --> 56:42.320
 individual don't have access to it. And some of it, you know, you don't have access to, you know,

56:42.320 --> 56:48.320
 don't have access to it. And somehow, you know, like the problem for music got solved. But for

56:48.320 --> 56:53.200
 papers, it's still like... It's just not yet. It could be ad supported, all those kinds of things.

56:53.200 --> 56:57.600
 And then hopefully, that would change the way we do science. This is the most exciting thing for me

56:58.480 --> 57:04.800
 is, especially once I started like making videos and this silly podcast thing, I started to realize

57:04.800 --> 57:13.120
 like that if you want to do science, one of the most effective ways is to do like couple the

57:13.120 --> 57:21.360
 paper with a set of YouTube videos, like explaining it. That also seems like there's a lot of room for

57:21.360 --> 57:27.120
 disruption there. What is the paper 2.0 going to look like? I think like LaTeX and the PDF,

57:28.000 --> 57:33.280
 seems like if you... It's interesting. If you look at the first paper that got published in Nature,

57:33.280 --> 57:37.360
 and if you look at the paper that got published in Nature today, if you look at the two side by

57:37.360 --> 57:42.880
 side, they are fundamentally the same. And even though like the paper that gets published today,

57:42.880 --> 57:49.760
 you know, you get... Even code, like right now, people put like code, like on a PDF.

57:51.040 --> 57:56.240
 And there are so many things that are related to papers today, you know, you have data,

57:56.240 --> 58:03.680
 you have code, you might need videos to better explain the concepts. So, I think for me,

58:03.680 --> 58:07.600
 it's natural that there's going to be also an evolution there, that papers are not going to be

58:07.600 --> 58:15.680
 just the static PDFs or LaTeX, there's going to be a next interface. So, in academia, a lot of

58:15.680 --> 58:22.160
 things that are judged, you're judged by is often quantity, not quality. I wonder if there's an

58:22.160 --> 58:27.520
 opportunity to have like... I tend to judge people by the best work they've ever done as opposed to...

58:28.960 --> 58:34.000
 I wonder if there's a possibility for that to encourage sort of focusing on the quality,

58:34.800 --> 58:39.840
 and not necessarily in paper form, but maybe a subset of a paper, subset of idea, almost even a

58:39.840 --> 58:46.800
 blog post or an experiment. Like, why does it have to be published in a journal to be legitimate?

58:46.800 --> 58:53.200
 And it's interesting that you mentioned that I also think like, yeah, it's why is that the only

58:53.200 --> 59:01.200
 format? Why can't a blog post or... We were even experimenting with these a few months ago,

59:01.200 --> 59:08.480
 or can you actually like publish something or like a new scientific breakthrough or

59:10.320 --> 59:13.280
 something that you've discovered in the form of like a set of tweets,

59:13.280 --> 59:20.240
 a Twitter thread. Why can't that be possible? And we were experimenting with that idea.

59:20.960 --> 59:26.560
 We even, yeah, we ran a couple of... Like some people submitted a couple of those,

59:26.560 --> 59:31.920
 like I think the limit was three or four tweets. Maybe it's a new way to look at a proof or

59:31.920 --> 59:37.120
 something, but I think it just serves to show that there should be other ways to publish

59:37.120 --> 59:43.520
 like scientific discoveries that don't fit the paper format. Well, but so even with the Twitter

59:43.520 --> 59:52.000
 thread, it would be nice to have some mechanism of formalizing it and making it into an NFT.

59:52.000 --> 1:00:00.880
 Like a concrete thing that you can reference as a link that's unique. Because, I mean, everything

1:00:00.880 --> 1:00:11.680
 we've been saying, all of that, while being true, it's also true that the constraints and the

1:00:11.680 --> 1:00:18.560
 formalism of a paper works well. It like forces you, constraints forces you to narrow down your

1:00:18.560 --> 1:00:29.120
 thing and literally put it on paper. But, you know, make concrete. And that's why, I mean,

1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:34.400
 it's not broken. It just could be better. And that's the main idea. I think there's something

1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:42.000
 about writing, whether it's a blog post or Twitter thread or a paper, that's really nice to

1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:51.040
 concretize a particular little idea that can then be referenced by other ideas, then it can be built

1:00:51.040 --> 1:01:01.440
 on top of with other ideas. So let me ask, you've read quite a few papers. You've annotated quite a

1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:08.640
 few papers. Let's talk about the process itself. How do you advise people read papers? Or maybe

1:01:08.640 --> 1:01:14.080
 you want to broaden it beyond just papers, but just read concrete pieces of information to

1:01:14.080 --> 1:01:20.160
 understand the insights that labeled in. I would say for paper specifically, I would bring back

1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:24.960
 kind of what Louise was talking about, is that it's important to keep in mind that papers are

1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:32.160
 not optimized for ease of understanding. And so, right, there's all sorts of restrictions and size

1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:38.880
 and format and language that they can use. And so it's important to keep that in mind. And so that

1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:45.200
 if you're struggling to read a paper, that might not mean that the underlying material is actually

1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:53.120
 that hard. And so that's definitely something that, especially for us, that we read papers and

1:01:53.120 --> 1:01:59.440
 most of the time the papers are completely outside of our comfort zone, I guess. And so it would be

1:01:59.440 --> 1:02:05.280
 completely new areas to us. So I always try to keep that in mind. So there's usually a certain

1:02:05.280 --> 1:02:12.480
 kind of structure, like abstract introductions, methodology, depending on the community and so on.

1:02:12.480 --> 1:02:19.280
 Is there something about the process of how to read it, whether you want to skim it to try to

1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:26.160
 find the parts that are easy to understand or not, reading it multiple times? Is there any kind of

1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:32.000
 hacks that you can comment on? I remember like Feynman had this kind of hack when he was reading

1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:39.360
 papers, where you would basically, I think I believe you would read the conclusion of the

1:02:39.360 --> 1:02:47.040
 paper. And we would try to just see if he would be able to figure out how to get to the conclusion

1:02:47.040 --> 1:02:54.640
 in like a couple of minutes by himself. And he would read a lot of papers that way. And I think

1:02:54.640 --> 1:02:59.760
 Fermi also did that almost. And Fermi was known for doing a lot of back of the envelope calculation.

1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:08.240
 So he was a master at doing that. And in terms of like, especially when reading a paper, I think

1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:14.160
 a lot of times people might feel discouraged about the first time you read it. You know,

1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:20.160
 it's very hard to grasp or you don't understand a huge fraction of the paper. And I think it's

1:03:20.160 --> 1:03:25.920
 having read a lot of papers in my life, I think I'm in peace with like the fact that you might

1:03:25.920 --> 1:03:31.280
 spend hours where you're just reading a paper and jumping from paper to paper, reading citations.

1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:38.560
 And like your level of understanding sometimes of the paper is very close to 0%. And all of a

1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:45.040
 sudden, you know, everything kind of makes sense in your mind. And then, you know, you have this

1:03:45.040 --> 1:03:54.000
 quantum jump where all of a sudden you understand the big picture of the paper. And this is an

1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:58.400
 exercise that I have to do when reading papers and especially like more complex papers, like,

1:03:58.400 --> 1:04:02.160
 okay, you don't understand because you're just going through the process and just keep going.

1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:07.360
 And like, it might feel super chaotic, especially if you're jumping from reference to reference.

1:04:07.360 --> 1:04:12.000
 You know, you might end up with like 20 tabs open and you're reading a ton of other papers,

1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:18.240
 but it's just trusting that process that at the end, like you'll find light. And I think for me,

1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:24.960
 that's a good framework when reading a paper. It's hard because, you know, you might end up spending

1:04:24.960 --> 1:04:32.080
 a lot of time and it looks like you're lost, but that's the process to actually, you know,

1:04:32.080 --> 1:04:34.640
 understand what they're talking about in the paper.

1:04:34.640 --> 1:04:40.320
 Yeah, I think that process, I enjoy, I've found a lot of value in the process, especially for

1:04:40.320 --> 1:04:47.520
 things outside my field of reading a lot of related work sections and kind of going down

1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:52.320
 that path of getting a big context of the field. Because what's, especially when they're well

1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:57.840
 written, there's opinions injected into the really related work. Like what work is important,

1:04:57.840 --> 1:05:03.600
 what is not. And if you read multiple related work sections that cite or don't cite each other,

1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:09.040
 like the papers, you get a sense of where the field, where the tensions of the field are,

1:05:09.760 --> 1:05:16.560
 where the field is striving. And that helps you put into context, like whether the work is radical,

1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:23.280
 whether it's overselling itself, whether it's underselling itself, all those things. And added

1:05:23.280 --> 1:05:31.200
 on top of that, I find that often the related work section is the most kind of accessible and

1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:38.160
 readable part of a paper because it's kind of, it's brief to the point, it's like summarizing,

1:05:38.160 --> 1:05:43.840
 it's almost like a Wikipedia style article. The introduction is supposed to be a compelling story

1:05:43.840 --> 1:05:49.120
 or whatever, but it's often like overselling, there's like an agenda in the introduction.

1:05:49.920 --> 1:05:54.960
 The related work usually has the least amount of agenda except for the few like elements where

1:05:54.960 --> 1:05:58.880
 you're trying to talk shit about previous work where you're trying to sell that you're doing

1:05:58.880 --> 1:06:05.040
 much better. But other than that, when you're just painting where the field came from or where the

1:06:05.040 --> 1:06:11.360
 field stands, that's really valuable. And also again, just to agree with Fionn in the conclusion,

1:06:11.360 --> 1:06:17.840
 I get a lot of value from the breadth first search, kind of read the conclusion, then read

1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:24.000
 the related work, and then go through the references in the related work, read the conclusion,

1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:30.720
 read the related work, and just go down the tree until you like hit dead ends or run out of coffee.

1:06:30.720 --> 1:06:35.760
 And then through that process, you go back up the tree and now you can see the results in their

1:06:35.760 --> 1:06:42.000
 proper context, unless of course the paper is truly revolutionary, which even that process will help

1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:50.960
 you understand that is in fact truly revolutionary. You've also, you talked about just following your

1:06:50.960 --> 1:06:59.040
 Twitter thread in depth first search. You talked about that you read the book on Grisha Perlman,

1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:07.120
 Grigori Perlman, and then you had a really nice Twitter thread on it and you were taking notes

1:07:07.120 --> 1:07:12.800
 throughout. So at a high level, is there suggestions you can give on how to take good notes?

1:07:13.440 --> 1:07:20.400
 Whether it's we're talking about annotations or just for yourself to try to put on paper ideas

1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:24.560
 as you progress through the work in order to then like understand the work better.

1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:31.280
 For me, I always try not to underestimate how much you can forget within six months after

1:07:31.280 --> 1:07:34.880
 you've read something. I thought you were going to say five minutes, but yeah, six months is good.

1:07:34.880 --> 1:07:42.240
 Yeah, or even shorter. And so that's something that I always try to keep in mind. And it's often,

1:07:42.240 --> 1:07:49.440
 I mean, every once in a while I'll read back a paper that I annotated on Fermat and I'll read

1:07:49.440 --> 1:07:59.120
 through my own annotations and I've completely forgotten what I had written. But it's interesting

1:07:59.120 --> 1:08:03.920
 because in a way, after you just understood something, you're kind of the best possible

1:08:03.920 --> 1:08:12.720
 teacher that can teach your future self. After you've forgotten it, you're kind of your own best

1:08:12.720 --> 1:08:19.520
 possible teacher at that moment. And so it can be great to try to capture that.

1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:27.280
 It's brilliant. It just made me kind of realize it's really nice to put yourself in the position

1:08:27.280 --> 1:08:32.800
 of teaching an older version of yourself that returns to this paper, almost like thinking literally.

1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:38.560
 That's under explored, but it's super powerful because you were the person that you can,

1:08:38.560 --> 1:08:43.280
 if you look at the scale from one not knowing anything about the topic and 10,

1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:48.320
 you are the one that progressed from one to 10 and you know which steps you struggled with.

1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:53.120
 So you're really the best person to help yourself make that transition from one to 10.

1:08:53.680 --> 1:09:02.480
 And a lot of the times, I really believe that the framework that we have to expose ourselves to

1:09:02.480 --> 1:09:07.680
 be talking to us when we were an expert, when we were taking that class and we knew everything

1:09:07.680 --> 1:09:12.160
 about quantum mechanics. And then six months later, you don't remember half of the things.

1:09:12.160 --> 1:09:18.080
 How could we make it easier to have those conversations between you and your past

1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:26.640
 expert self? I think there might be, it's an under explored idea. I think notes on paper

1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:30.560
 are probably not the best way. I'm not sure if it's a combination of video,

1:09:31.360 --> 1:09:36.720
 audio, where it's like you have a guided framework that you follow to extract information from

1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:44.160
 yourself so that you can later kind of revisit to make it easier to remember. But that's,

1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:50.560
 I think it's an interesting idea worth exploring that I haven't seen a lot of people kind of

1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:53.200
 trying to distill that problem.

1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:59.680
 Yeah, I'm creating the kind of tools. I find if I record, it sounds weird, but I'll take notes,

1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:09.440
 but if I record audio, like little clips of thoughts, like rants, that's really effective

1:10:09.440 --> 1:10:14.960
 at capturing something that notes can't. Because when I replay them, for some reason,

1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:22.160
 it loads my brain back into where I was when I was reading that in a way that notes don't. Like

1:10:22.160 --> 1:10:29.040
 when I read notes, I'll often be like, what? What was I thinking there? But when I listened

1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:35.440
 to the audio, it brings you right back to that place. And maybe with video, with visual, that

1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:36.880
 might be even more powerful.

1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:37.440
 I think so.

1:10:38.320 --> 1:10:45.680
 And I think just the process of verbalizing it, that alone kind of makes you have to structure

1:10:45.680 --> 1:10:51.280
 your thought and put it in a way that somebody else could come and understand it. And just

1:10:51.280 --> 1:10:58.400
 the process of that is useful to organize your thoughts and yeah, just that alone.

1:10:58.400 --> 1:11:02.480
 Does the Fermat's Library Journal Club have a video component or no?

1:11:03.680 --> 1:11:07.920
 Not natively. We sometimes will include videos, but it's always embedded.

1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:12.720
 Do people build videos on top of it to explain the paper? Because you're doing all the hard work

1:11:12.720 --> 1:11:14.880
 of understanding deeply the paper.

1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:22.560
 We haven't seen that happening too much. But we were actually playing around with the idea of

1:11:22.560 --> 1:11:29.040
 creating some sort of podcast version where we try to distill the paper on an audio format that

1:11:29.040 --> 1:11:30.320
 not maybe you can have access to.

1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:31.280
 Might be tricky.

1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:35.120
 Might be trickier, but there are definitely people that could be interested in the paper

1:11:35.120 --> 1:11:40.080
 and that topic, but are not willing to read it. But they might listen to a 30 minute episode

1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:44.720
 on that paper. You could reach more people and you might even bring the authors to the

1:11:44.720 --> 1:11:49.520
 conversation, but it's tricky. And especially for like more technical papers. We've thought

1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:55.920
 about doing that, but we haven't converged. I'm not sure if you have any tips.

1:11:55.920 --> 1:12:00.800
 Well, I'm going to take that as a small project to take one of the Fermat's almost like

1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:05.840
 half advertisement and half as a challenge for myself to take one of the annotated papers and

1:12:05.840 --> 1:12:14.160
 use it as a basis for creating a quick video. I've seen like, hopefully I'm saying the name

1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:20.720
 correctly, but machine learning street talk. I think that's the name of the show that I

1:12:20.720 --> 1:12:26.320
 recommend highly. That's the right name. But they do exactly that, which is multiple hour

1:12:26.320 --> 1:12:32.240
 breakdown of a paper with video component. Sometimes with authors, people love it.

1:12:32.240 --> 1:12:33.520
 It's very effective.

1:12:33.520 --> 1:12:39.440
 There's also, I've seen, I haven't seen the entire, in its entirety, but I've seen like the

1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:46.320
 founder of comma.ai, George. I've seen him like just taking a paper and then, you know,

1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:53.440
 distilling the paper and coding it, coding it sometimes during 10 hours. And he was able to,

1:12:53.440 --> 1:12:57.120
 you know, get a lot of people interested in that and viewing him.

1:12:57.120 --> 1:13:03.280
 I'm a huge fan of that. Like, George is a personality. I think a lot of people like

1:13:03.280 --> 1:13:08.880
 listen to this podcast for the same reason. It's not necessarily the contents. They like to listen

1:13:08.880 --> 1:13:16.560
 to like a silly Russian who has a childlike brain and mumbles and all those like struggle with

1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:22.160
 ideas, right? And George is a madman who people just enjoy. Like, how is he going to struggle

1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:26.320
 in implementing this particular paper? How is he going to struggle with this idea? It's fun to

1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:29.600
 watch and that actually pulls you in. The personality is important there.

1:13:29.600 --> 1:13:34.720
 True. But there's, you know, I agree with you, but there also, it's visible, like it's,

1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:39.520
 there's an extraordinary ability that is there. Like, he's talented and you need to have,

1:13:40.080 --> 1:13:45.120
 there's a craft and this guy definitely has talent and he's doing something that is not easy.

1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:47.520
 And I think that also draws the attention of people.

1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:48.160
 Oh yeah.

1:13:48.160 --> 1:13:53.600
 And like the other day we were actually, we ran into this YouTube channel of this guy that was

1:13:53.600 --> 1:14:03.120
 restoring art, right? And it was basically just a video of him, like the production is really like

1:14:03.120 --> 1:14:09.760
 really well done. And it's just him taking really old pieces of art, like, and then paintings and

1:14:09.760 --> 1:14:14.880
 then restoring them. But he's really good at that. And he describes that process. And that draws

1:14:14.880 --> 1:14:20.480
 attention, draws the attention of people, regardless of your craft, be it like annotating a

1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:22.320
 paper or like restoring it.

1:14:22.320 --> 1:14:26.400
 Procurement, excellence. Yeah. Like George is incredibly good at programming.

1:14:26.400 --> 1:14:34.720
 Like quick, like, you know, those competitive programmers, like Topcoder and all those kinds of

1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:38.800
 stuff, he has the same kind of element where the brain just jumps around really quickly.

1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:48.640
 And that's, yeah, just like, it's motivating, but you're right in watching people who are good at

1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:52.720
 what they do. It's motivating. Even if the thing you're trying to do is not what they're doing,

1:14:52.720 --> 1:14:57.280
 it's contagious when they're really good at it. And the same kind of analysis with the paper,

1:14:57.280 --> 1:15:03.280
 I think, not just like the final result, but the process of struggling with it. That's really

1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:07.760
 interesting. Yeah. I think, I mean, I think Twitch proved that, like, you know, that there's

1:15:07.760 --> 1:15:14.560
 really a market for that, for watching people do things that they're really good at. And you'll

1:15:14.560 --> 1:15:20.480
 just watch it. You will enjoy that. That might even spike your interest in that specific topic.

1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:26.720
 And yeah, and people will enjoy watching sometimes hours on end of great craftsmans.

1:15:27.280 --> 1:15:31.520
 Do you mind if we talk about some of the papers? Do any papers come to mind

1:15:31.520 --> 1:15:33.760
 that have been annotated on Fermat's library?

1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:39.040
 The papers that we annotated can be about completely random topics, but that's part of

1:15:39.040 --> 1:15:43.440
 what we enjoy as well. It forces you to explore these topics that otherwise maybe you'd never

1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:51.760
 run into. And so the ones that come to mind are, to me, are fairly random. But one that I really

1:15:51.760 --> 1:16:00.080
 enjoyed learning more about is a paper written by a mathematician, actually, Thomas Postol,

1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:10.240
 and about a tunnel in a Greek island off the coast of Turkey. So it's very random.

1:16:10.240 --> 1:16:18.000
 Yeah. Okay, so what's interesting about this tunnel? So this tunnel was built in the sixth

1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:27.360
 century BC. And it was built in the island of Samos, which is, as I said, off the coast of Turkey.

1:16:27.360 --> 1:16:33.760
 And they had the city on one side, and they had a mountain, and then they had a bunch of

1:16:33.760 --> 1:16:40.000
 springs on the other side, and they wanted to bring water into the city. Building an aqueduct

1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:44.880
 would be pretty hard because of the way the mountain was shaped. And it would also, if they

1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:51.360
 were under a siege, they could just easily destroy that aqueduct, and then the water wouldn't have

1:16:51.360 --> 1:16:56.480
 any water supply. The city wouldn't have any water supply. And so they decided to build a tunnel,

1:16:57.680 --> 1:17:06.720
 and they decided to try to do it quickly. And so they started digging from both ends

1:17:06.720 --> 1:17:12.480
 at the same time through the mountain. And so when you start thinking about this,

1:17:12.480 --> 1:17:19.920
 it's a fairly difficult problem. And this is like sixth century BC, so you had very limited access

1:17:20.560 --> 1:17:25.360
 to the mathematical tools that you had at the time, were very limited. And so what this paper

1:17:25.360 --> 1:17:32.320
 is about is about the story of how they built it and about the fact that for about 2000 years,

1:17:32.320 --> 1:17:38.960
 kind of the accepted explanation of how they built it was actually wrong. And so this tunnel

1:17:38.960 --> 1:17:43.360
 has been famous for a while. There are a number of historians that talked about it since ancient

1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:54.480
 Egypt. And the method that they described for building it was just wrong. And so these researchers

1:17:54.480 --> 1:18:00.960
 went there and were able to figure that out. And so basically, kind of the way that they thought

1:18:00.960 --> 1:18:06.080
 they had built it was basically, if you can imagine looking at the mountain from the top,

1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:11.760
 and you have the mountain and then you have both entrances. And so what they thought,

1:18:11.760 --> 1:18:18.480
 and this is what the ancient historians described, is that they effectively tried to draw a right

1:18:19.600 --> 1:18:27.280
 angle triangle with the two entrances at each end of the hypotenuse. And the way they did it is like

1:18:27.280 --> 1:18:32.640
 they would go around the mountain and kind of walking in a grid fashion. And then you can figure

1:18:32.640 --> 1:18:40.480
 out the two sides of the triangle. And then after you have that triangle, you can effectively draw

1:18:40.480 --> 1:18:47.360
 two smaller triangles at each entrance that are proportional to that big triangle. And then you

1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:54.560
 kind of have arrows pointing in each way. And then you know at least that you have a line going

1:18:54.560 --> 1:19:01.920
 through the mountain that connects both entrances. The issue with that is like once you go to this

1:19:01.920 --> 1:19:06.960
 mountain and you start thinking of doing this, you realize that especially given that the tools that

1:19:06.960 --> 1:19:12.400
 they had at the time, that your error margin would be too small. You wouldn't be able to do it.

1:19:14.960 --> 1:19:20.880
 Just the fact of trying to build this triangle in that fashion, the error would accumulate and you

1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:24.960
 would end up missing. You'd start building these tunnels and they would miss each other. So the task

1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:30.320
 ultimately is to figure out like really perfectly as close as possible the direction you should be

1:19:30.320 --> 1:19:35.680
 digging. First of all that it's possible to have a straight line through and then what that the

1:19:35.680 --> 1:19:40.960
 direction would be. And then you are trying to infer that by constructing a right triangle

1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:49.280
 by doing. I'm not exactly sure about how to do that rigorously like by tracing the mountain,

1:19:49.280 --> 1:19:55.040
 by walking along the mountain. You said grids? Yeah you kind of walk as if you were in a grid

1:19:55.040 --> 1:20:00.800
 and so you just walk in right angles. But then you have to walk really precisely then. Exactly.

1:20:00.800 --> 1:20:07.360
 You have to use tools to measure this and the terrain is probably a mess. So this makes more

1:20:07.360 --> 1:20:14.480
 sense in 2D and 3D gets even weirder. So okay gotcha. But so this method was described by like

1:20:14.480 --> 1:20:20.720
 an ancient Egyptian historian. I think hero of Alexandria. And then for about like yeah for

1:20:20.720 --> 1:20:28.720
 about 2000 years that's how we thought that they had built this tunnel. And then these

1:20:28.720 --> 1:20:35.600
 researchers went there and found out that actually they must have had to use other methods. And then

1:20:35.600 --> 1:20:41.040
 in this paper they describe these other methods and of course they can't know for sure. But

1:20:41.040 --> 1:20:46.880
 there's they present a bunch of plausible alternatives. The one that for me was is the

1:20:46.880 --> 1:20:51.920
 most plausible is that what they probably must have done is to use something that is similar to

1:20:52.720 --> 1:21:00.240
 an iron sight on a rifle. The way you can line up your rifle with a target off in the distance

1:21:00.240 --> 1:21:08.160
 by having an iron sight. And they must have done something similar to that

1:21:08.160 --> 1:21:16.560
 effectively with three sticks. And that way they were able to line up sticks along the side of the

1:21:16.560 --> 1:21:21.920
 mountain that were all on the same height. And so that then you could get to the other side

1:21:22.480 --> 1:21:26.640
 and you could and then you could draw that line. So this for me is the most plausible

1:21:27.840 --> 1:21:34.400
 way that they might have done that. But then they described this in detail and other possible

1:21:34.400 --> 1:21:40.320
 approaches in this paper. So this is a mathematician doing this? Yeah this is a mathematician that did

1:21:40.320 --> 1:21:46.880
 this. Which I suppose is the right mindset instead of skills required to solve an ancient problem

1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:52.320
 right? Yeah. Yeah. There's mathematicians and engineers a lot of things. Because they didn't

1:21:52.320 --> 1:21:58.240
 have computers or drones or lidar back then or whatever technology you would use modern day for

1:21:58.240 --> 1:22:04.640
 the civil engineering. Yeah. Another fascinating thing is that like you know after effectively

1:22:04.640 --> 1:22:09.600
 after the the downfall of the Roman civilization people didn't build tunnels for about a thousand

1:22:09.600 --> 1:22:15.360
 years. We go a thousand years without tunnels and then like only in like in late middle ages that

1:22:15.360 --> 1:22:20.640
 we start doing them again. But here is the tunnel like sixth century BC like incredibly limited

1:22:20.640 --> 1:22:28.960
 mathematics and they and they build it in this way. And it was a mystery for a long time exactly

1:22:28.960 --> 1:22:35.040
 how they did it. And then these mathematicians went there and basically with no archaeology

1:22:35.040 --> 1:22:40.400
 kind of background were able to figure it out. How do annotations for this paper look like? What is

1:22:40.400 --> 1:22:46.640
 it what's a successful annotation for paper like this? Yeah so sometimes you're for this paper

1:22:46.640 --> 1:22:54.160
 sometimes adding some more context on on a specific part like sometimes they they mentioned

1:22:54.160 --> 1:23:02.000
 for instance these instruments that were common in ancient Greece and ancient Rome for for building

1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:08.240
 things. And and and so in some of those annotations I describe these instruments in more detail and

1:23:08.240 --> 1:23:12.960
 how they worked because sometimes it can be hard to to visualize these.

1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:20.720
 Then this paper I forget exactly when when this was published I believe maybe maybe the 70s.

1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:26.240
 And then there was further research into this tunnel and more interesting other interesting

1:23:26.240 --> 1:23:32.720
 aspects about it. I add those to that paper as well. There's historical context that I also go

1:23:32.720 --> 1:23:39.280
 into there for instance the fact that as a as I said that effectively after the downfall of the

1:23:39.280 --> 1:23:43.360
 Roman Empire no tunnels were built like this something that I that I go that I that I added

1:23:43.360 --> 1:23:49.360
 to the paper as well. Yeah so so when other people look at the paper how do they usually consume the

1:23:49.360 --> 1:23:55.920
 annotations? So they it's like is there a commenting feature is the I mean like this is a really

1:23:55.920 --> 1:24:02.000
 enriching experience the way you read a paper. What what aspects do you do people usually talk

1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:09.120
 about that they they value from this? So yeah so anybody can just go on there and and either add

1:24:09.120 --> 1:24:15.840
 a new annotation or add a comment to an existing annotation and so you can start a kind of a thread

1:24:15.840 --> 1:24:21.680
 within an existing annotation. And that's something that happens relative frequency and then

1:24:21.680 --> 1:24:27.440
 because I was the original author of the initial annotation I get pinged and so oftentimes I'll go

1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:33.840
 back and and and add on to to that thread. How'd you pick the paper? I mean first of all this whole

1:24:33.840 --> 1:24:38.880
 process is really exciting. I'm gonna especially after this conversation I'm gonna make sure I

1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:44.960
 participate much more actively on papers that I know a lot about and on paper I know nothing about.

1:24:44.960 --> 1:24:52.880
 I should both of us annotate the paper. I would love to. I also I mean I realized that uh there's

1:24:52.880 --> 1:25:02.640
 like it's an opportunity for people like me to publicly annotate a paper. Or do an AMA around

1:25:02.640 --> 1:25:09.760
 the paper. Yeah exactly but yeah but like be um be in the conversation about a paper. It's like a

1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:15.200
 place to have a conversation about an idea. You get the other way to do it that's much more ad hoc

1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:19.760
 is on Twitter right? But this is more like formal and you don't have to be in the conversation

1:25:19.760 --> 1:25:24.880
 on Twitter right? But this is more like formal and you could actually probably integrate the two.

1:25:24.880 --> 1:25:29.360
 You have a conversation about the conversation. So the Twitter is the conversation about a

1:25:29.360 --> 1:25:34.720
 conversation and the main conversation is in this space of annotations. There's an interesting effect

1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:39.440
 that we we see sometimes with the annotations on our papers is that a lot of people especially if

1:25:39.440 --> 1:25:46.960
 we the annotations are really well done people sometimes are afraid of adding more annotations

1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:51.440
 because they see that as a kind of a finished work. Yes. And so they they don't want to pollute

1:25:51.440 --> 1:25:57.280
 that or uh and especially if it's like a silly question. This is I don't think that's good. I

1:25:57.280 --> 1:26:02.400
 think you know we should as much as possible try to lower the barrier for someone to jump in and

1:26:02.400 --> 1:26:07.600
 ask questions. I think it only like most of the times it adds value but it's some feedback that

1:26:07.600 --> 1:26:17.680
 we got from users and and readers. I'm not exactly sure how to to kind of fight that but um. Well I

1:26:17.680 --> 1:26:26.080
 think I think if I serve as an inspiration in any way is by asking a lot of dumb questions and saying

1:26:26.080 --> 1:26:31.200
 a bunch of dumb shit all the time and hopefully that inspires the rest of the other folks to do

1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:37.440
 the same because that's the only way to knowledge I think is to be willing to ask the dumb questions.

1:26:37.440 --> 1:26:42.160
 And there are papers that are like um you know we have a lot of papers on Fermat's where it's just

1:26:42.160 --> 1:26:48.400
 one page or really short papers and you we have like the shortest paper ever published in a math

1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:53.200
 journal like with like just a couple of words. Yeah. One of my favorite papers on the platform

1:26:53.200 --> 1:26:59.520
 is actually a paper um written by Enrico Fermi. Yeah. And the title of the paper is my obs I think

1:26:59.520 --> 1:27:06.240
 is my observations at Trinity. So basically Fermi was part of the Manhattan Project. So he was in

1:27:06.240 --> 1:27:13.120
 New Mexico when they exploded the first atomic bomb and so he was a couple of miles away from

1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:18.960
 the explosion and he was probably one of the first persons to calculate the energy of the explosion.

1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:25.040
 And so the way he did that was he took a piece of paper and he tore down a piece of paper in in

1:27:25.040 --> 1:27:30.560
 little pieces and when the bomb exploded the Trinity bomb was the name of the bomb like he

1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:37.440
 waited for the blast to arrive at where he was and then he threw those pieces of paper in the air

1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:42.800
 and he calculated the energy based on the displacement of the paper the pieces of paper

1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:47.920
 and then he wrote a report which was classified until like a couple of years ago one page report

1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:53.600
 like calculating the energy of the explosion. Oh that's so badass. And I we actually went there

1:27:53.600 --> 1:27:58.960
 and kind of unpacked and like I think he just mentions basically the energy and we we actually

1:27:58.960 --> 1:28:04.480
 went and one of the annotations is like explaining how he did that. I wonder how accurate he was.

1:28:05.040 --> 1:28:10.880
 It was maybe I think like 20 or 25 percent off. Then there was another person that actually

1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:17.680
 calculated the energy based on images after the explosion at the rate and the rate at which the

1:28:18.800 --> 1:28:23.440
 like the mushroom of the explosion expanded and it's more accurate to calculate the energy based

1:28:23.440 --> 1:28:29.200
 on that and I think it was like 20 20 percent off but it's it's really interesting because you know

1:28:29.200 --> 1:28:34.240
 Fermi was known for all these being a master at these back of the envelope calculations always

1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:40.480
 like the the Fermi problems are well known for for that and it's super interesting to see like

1:28:40.480 --> 1:28:45.760
 that just one page report that was also actually classified and it's interesting because a couple

1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:52.640
 months ago when the Beirut explosion happened there was a video circulating of these a bride

1:28:52.640 --> 1:28:57.760
 that was doing a photo shoot when the explosion in Beirut happened and so you can see a video of

1:28:57.760 --> 1:29:02.160
 her with the wedding dress and then the explosion happens in the blast arrives at where she was she

1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:09.200
 was a couple of miles away from the last and you can see like the displacement of the dress as well

1:29:09.200 --> 1:29:13.280
 and I actually looked and that video went viral on Twitter and I actually looked at that video

1:29:13.280 --> 1:29:18.880
 and based I used the same techniques that Fermi used to calculate the energy of the explosion

1:29:18.880 --> 1:29:23.520
 based on the displacement of the dress and you could actually see where where she was at the

1:29:23.520 --> 1:29:27.520
 the distance from the explosion because there was a store behind her and you could look the name of

1:29:27.520 --> 1:29:32.720
 the store and and so I calculated that it was the distance and then you can the based on the

1:29:32.720 --> 1:29:37.600
 distance where she was from the the explosion and also on the the displacement of the dress

1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:43.520
 like because you can when the blast happens like you can see the dress going back and then going

1:29:43.520 --> 1:29:49.360
 back to the original position and like by just looking at like how much the the dress moved you

1:29:49.360 --> 1:29:54.960
 can estimate the explode the energy of the explosion I assume you published this on Twitter

1:29:54.960 --> 1:30:00.720
 was just a Twitter thread but it actually like a lot of people share that and it was picked up by

1:30:00.720 --> 1:30:07.120
 a couple of news outlets but I was hoping it would be like a formal title and it would be an archive

1:30:07.120 --> 1:30:11.440
 no no no it may be submitted just the Twitter thread but it was interesting because it was

1:30:11.440 --> 1:30:17.920
 exactly the same method that Fermi used is there something else that jumps to mind like what is

1:30:17.920 --> 1:30:23.040
 there something um I know like in terms of papers like I know the Bitcoin paper is super popular

1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:28.560
 is there something interesting to be said about any of the white papers in the cryptocurrency space

1:30:29.680 --> 1:30:36.560
 yeah the the the Bitcoin paper was the first paper that we put on for months and uh why that

1:30:36.560 --> 1:30:42.720
 why that choice as the first paper it was a while ago and it was one of the papers that I read

1:30:42.720 --> 1:30:48.400
 and then uh and then kind of explained it to to louise and or to other friends that do this

1:30:48.400 --> 1:30:56.000
 journal club with us and um I did some research in cryptography uh as an undergrad and so it was a

1:30:56.000 --> 1:31:02.880
 topic that I was interested in um but even for me that I I had that background but reading the

1:31:02.880 --> 1:31:08.720
 Bitcoin paper it took me a few reads to really kind of wrap my head around it it's it's right

1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:14.400
 it's it uses very spartan precise language in a way it's like you feel like you can't take any

1:31:14.400 --> 1:31:20.800
 word out of it without something falling apart and uh and it's all there I think it's a beautiful

1:31:20.800 --> 1:31:28.400
 paper and it's it's it's very well written of course but um you know we wanted to try to make

1:31:28.400 --> 1:31:33.840
 it accessible so that anybody that maybe is an undergrad in computer science could go on there

1:31:33.840 --> 1:31:39.840
 and then and and know that you have all the information in in that page that you're going

1:31:39.840 --> 1:31:45.840
 to need to understand the mechanics of Bitcoin and so like I explain you know the basic

1:31:47.120 --> 1:31:52.080
 public key cryptography that you need to to know in order to understand it like explain

1:31:52.080 --> 1:31:57.040
 okay what are the properties of a hash function and how they are useful in this context

1:31:57.040 --> 1:32:02.560
 um explain what a merkle tree is so a bunch of those basic concepts that maybe if you're reading

1:32:02.560 --> 1:32:06.080
 it for a first time and you're an undergrad and you know you don't know those terms you're going

1:32:06.080 --> 1:32:10.800
 to be you know discouraged because maybe okay now I have to go and google around until I understand

1:32:10.800 --> 1:32:16.640
 these before I can make progress in the paper um and and this way it's all there you know so so

1:32:16.640 --> 1:32:23.840
 there's a magic to also to the fact that over time more people went on there and and added further

1:32:23.840 --> 1:32:29.280
 annotations so the the idea that the paper gets easier and more accessible over time but that's

1:32:29.280 --> 1:32:36.000
 still you're still looking at the original content the way the the author intended it to be uh but

1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:43.680
 there's just more context and the toughest bits have have more in depth explanations okay I think

1:32:43.680 --> 1:32:50.640
 like there's a just so many interesting papers uh there like I remember reading the paper that was

1:32:50.640 --> 1:32:56.720
 written by Freeman Dyson on the like the the first time that he explained he came up with

1:32:56.720 --> 1:33:02.720
 the concept of the Dyson sphere and he he put that out like it's again it's a one page paper

1:33:02.720 --> 1:33:10.240
 um and he what he explained was that eventually if a civilization develops and and grows there's

1:33:10.240 --> 1:33:16.880
 going to be a point where when the resources on the planet are not are not enough for the energy

1:33:16.880 --> 1:33:22.160
 requirements of that civilization so if you want to go the next step is you need to go to the next

1:33:22.160 --> 1:33:28.480
 star and extract energy from that star and the way to do it is you need to build some sort of cap

1:33:28.480 --> 1:33:35.280
 around the star that extracts the energy so he theorized this idea of the the Dyson sphere

1:33:35.280 --> 1:33:40.640
 and he went on to kind of analyze how you would build that the stability of that sphere like

1:33:40.640 --> 1:33:45.680
 if something happens if there's like a small oscillation with that fear collapse into the

1:33:45.680 --> 1:33:53.040
 star or know what what would happen and even went on to kind of say that a good way for us to look

1:33:53.040 --> 1:34:00.240
 for signs of intelligent life out there is to look for signals of these Dyson spheres and because you

1:34:00.240 --> 1:34:04.160
 know according to the law of second law of thermodynamics like there's going to be some a

1:34:04.160 --> 1:34:08.320
 lot of infrared radiation that is going to be emitted as a consequence of extracting energy

1:34:08.320 --> 1:34:14.960
 from the star and we should be able to see those signals of like infrared if we look at the sky

1:34:14.960 --> 1:34:20.080
 but all these like from the introduction of the concept like the how to build the Dyson sphere

1:34:20.080 --> 1:34:24.800
 the problems of like having a Dyson sphere how to detect how that could be used as a signal for

1:34:24.800 --> 1:34:29.600
 intelligence life really that's all in the paper all in one like one page paper and it's like it's

1:34:29.600 --> 1:34:35.040
 it's for me it's beautiful it's like where was this published i don't remember it's fascinating

1:34:35.040 --> 1:34:41.760
 that papers like that could be yeah i mean the guts it takes to put that all together in a paper

1:34:41.760 --> 1:34:46.880
 before you know that that kind of challenges our previous discussion that of paper i mean papers

1:34:46.880 --> 1:34:52.480
 can be beautiful you can play with the format right it but there's a lot to unpack there that's

1:34:52.480 --> 1:34:57.440
 like the the that's the the starting point but it's it's beautiful that you're able to put that

1:34:57.440 --> 1:35:03.760
 in one page and then people can build on top of that and but the key ideas are there yeah exactly

1:35:04.640 --> 1:35:09.360
 what about have you looked at any of the the big seminal papers throughout the history of

1:35:09.360 --> 1:35:16.000
 science like you look at simple like einstein papers have any of those been annotated yeah

1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:22.320
 yeah no we we have some more seminal papers that that people have heard about um you know we have

1:35:22.320 --> 1:35:33.200
 the the DNA double elix paper on there we have the Higgs boson uh paper um yeah there's papers

1:35:33.200 --> 1:35:39.360
 that they'll that we know that it's they're not going to be finding out about them because of us

1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:45.120
 but it's papers that we think um should be more widely read and that folks would benefit from

1:35:45.120 --> 1:35:50.640
 having some annotations there and so we also have a number of those a lot of like discovery papers

1:35:50.640 --> 1:35:56.400
 for fundamental like particles and all that there's we have a lot of those on from us library

1:35:56.400 --> 1:36:00.560
 um yeah we i would like to end we haven't annotated that one but i'd like to on the

1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:06.880
 Riemann hypothesis that's a really interesting paper as well um and and but we haven't annotated

1:36:06.880 --> 1:36:13.520
 that one but there's a lot of like more historical landmark papers um on the platform have you done

1:36:13.520 --> 1:36:19.680
 uh Poincare conjecture with uh with Perlman that's too much that's too much that's too much

1:36:19.680 --> 1:36:25.040
 too much for me but it's uh it's it's interesting that you know and going back to our discussion

1:36:25.040 --> 1:36:30.000
 like the the Poincare paper was like published on archive and and it was not on a journal like

1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:34.640
 the three papers and yeah what do you make of that i mean he's such a fascinating human being

1:36:34.640 --> 1:36:40.320
 exactly i mentioned to you offline that i'm going to russia he's somebody i'm really uh to interview

1:36:40.320 --> 1:36:48.800
 yeah i well i so i definitely will interview him i um and i believe i will i believe i can i just

1:36:48.800 --> 1:36:57.520
 don't know how to i know where he lives so here okay my my uh my hope is my conjecture is that

1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:03.280
 if i just show up to the house and look desperate enough uh that uh or threatening enough for some

1:37:03.280 --> 1:37:08.720
 combination of both that like the only way to get rid of me is to just get the thing done that's the

1:37:08.720 --> 1:37:14.080
 hope it's actually interesting that you mentioned that because i after i um so a couple of weeks ago

1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:19.760
 i was searching for like stuff about Perlman Perlman online ended up on this twitter account

1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:26.000
 of like this guy that claims to be Perlman Perlman's assistant and he's like he has been

1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:30.640
 posting a bunch of pictures like next to Perlman you can see like Perlman in in a library and he's

1:37:30.640 --> 1:37:36.080
 like next to him like taking a selfie or like Perlman walking on the street and like maybe you

1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:42.640
 could reach out to his assistant then i'll send you i'll send you this twitter account so maybe

1:37:42.640 --> 1:37:47.120
 you're onto something no but but going going back to like Perlman is super interesting because the

1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:53.040
 fact that he published the the the the proofs on archive is what was also like a way for him to

1:37:53.040 --> 1:37:58.160
 because he really didn't like the scientific publishing industry and the fact that you had to

1:37:58.160 --> 1:38:06.000
 pay to get uh access to to articles and that was a form of like protest and that's why he published

1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:11.680
 um those papers there i mean i i think Perlman is just a fascinating like character and for me

1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:18.240
 it's this kind of ideal of a platonic ideal of what a mathematician should be you know it's it's

1:38:18.240 --> 1:38:23.200
 someone that is you know it's just cares about deeply cares about mathematics you know it cares

1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:31.040
 about fair attribution of of um disregards money and um and and like the fact that he published

1:38:31.040 --> 1:38:35.920
 like on archive was is a good example of what about the Fields Medal that he turned down the

1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:42.000
 Fields Medal what's what's yeah what do you make of that yeah i mean if you look at like the reasons

1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:47.840
 why he rejected the Fields Medal so after so Perlman did a postdoc in the US and when he came

1:38:47.840 --> 1:38:53.840
 back to Russia um do you know how good his English is i think it's very fairly good it's pretty good

1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:59.760
 i think it's really good especially given lectures yeah but i haven't been able to listen to anything

1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:03.920
 well certainly not listen but i haven't been able to get anybody because i know a lot of people have

1:39:03.920 --> 1:39:10.480
 been to those lectures i'm not able to get a sense of like yeah but how strong is the accent what are

1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:13.840
 we talking about here is this going to have to be in Russian it's going to have to be in English

1:39:13.840 --> 1:39:18.480
 is fascinating but he writes the papers in English so true like there's there's but there's so many

1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:23.840
 like it's such a fascinating character and um there are a couple of examples like him like at

1:39:23.840 --> 1:39:29.280
 i think 28 or 29 he proved like a really famous uh conjecture called the soul conjecture i believe

1:39:29.280 --> 1:39:34.000
 it was like in a very short four page proof of that was a really big breakthrough then he went

1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:40.720
 to Princeton to give a lecture on that and after the lecture uh the the chair of the math department

1:39:40.720 --> 1:39:46.000
 at Princeton a guy called Peter Sarnak went up to to Perelman was trying to recruit him

1:39:46.640 --> 1:39:52.640
 trying to offer him a position at Princeton and he was and at some point he asked for Perelman's

1:39:52.640 --> 1:39:59.600
 resume and Perelman responded saying just gave a lecture on like this really tough problem why do

1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:06.160
 you need my resume like i'm not gonna send you like i just proved like my value uh but uh but

1:40:06.160 --> 1:40:12.560
 going back to the Fields Medal like when when Perelman went to back to Russia he arrived at a

1:40:12.560 --> 1:40:20.800
 time where the the salary of postdocs were so much off in regards to inflation that they were not

1:40:20.800 --> 1:40:25.920
 making any money like the the people didn't even bother to pick up the checks at the end of the

1:40:25.920 --> 1:40:30.640
 month because they were just like ridiculous but thankfully he had some money that he had

1:40:30.640 --> 1:40:36.320
 uh gained while he was doing this postdoc so he just concentrated on like the Poincare the the

1:40:36.320 --> 1:40:42.560
 Poincare conjecture problem which he when he when he took that um he took it after uh it was

1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:48.320
 reframed by this uh mathematician called Richard Hamilton which posed the problem in a way that

1:40:48.320 --> 1:40:54.320
 it turned into this super like math Olympiad problem with like perfect boundaries well defined

1:40:54.320 --> 1:40:59.360
 and that was perfect for Perelman to attack and so he spent like seven years working on that and

1:40:59.360 --> 1:41:06.720
 then in 2002 he started publishing those papers on archive and people started jumping on that

1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:12.480
 reading those papers and there was like a lot of excitement around that a couple of years later

1:41:12.480 --> 1:41:18.320
 there were two researchers i believe it was they were from Harvard that took Perelman's Perelman's

1:41:18.320 --> 1:41:25.200
 work they sanded some of the edges and they republished that saying that you know based on

1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:31.920
 Perelman's work they were able to figure out the the Poincare conjecture and then there was um

1:41:31.920 --> 1:41:39.280
 at the time at the the international um conference of mathematics in 2000 2006 i believe that's when

1:41:39.280 --> 1:41:44.960
 they were going to give out the Fields Medal there was a lot of debate like oh who's who's

1:41:44.960 --> 1:41:52.720
 like we should get the credit for solving this big problem and for Perelman it like it it felt

1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:57.280
 really sad that people were even considering that he was not the person that solved that

1:41:57.840 --> 1:42:03.520
 and and the claims that those like researchers when they published after Perelman they were

1:42:03.520 --> 1:42:07.520
 false claims that they were the ones they just sanded a couple of edges like Perelman did all

1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:14.320
 the really hard work and so just just the fact that they doubted that Perelman had done that

1:42:14.320 --> 1:42:19.280
 like was enough for him to say i'm not i'm not interested in this prize and that was one of the

1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:25.920
 reasons why he rejected the Fields Medal then he also rejected the clay prize so the Poincare

1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:30.560
 conjecture was one of the millennium prizes there was a million dollar prize associated with that

1:42:30.560 --> 1:42:35.920
 problem and that has to add to do with the fact that for them to attribute that prize i think it

1:42:35.920 --> 1:42:43.520
 had to be published on a journal yes the proof and again Perelman's principles of like interfered

1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:48.800
 here and and he also just didn't care about the money he was like um clay i think was a businessman

1:42:48.800 --> 1:42:53.040
 and he's like doesn't have to do anything with with mathematics i don't care about these like

1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:58.960
 that's one of the reasons why he rejected it yeah there's it's hard to convert into words but

1:43:00.080 --> 1:43:07.680
 at MIT i'm distinctly aware of the distinction between when i enter a room there's a certain

1:43:07.680 --> 1:43:15.520
 kind of music to the way people talk when we're talking about ideas versus what that music sounds

1:43:15.520 --> 1:43:24.640
 like when we're talking when it's like bickering in the space of like whether it's politics or

1:43:24.640 --> 1:43:35.280
 funding or egos it's a different sound to it and i'm distinctly aware of the two and i kind of

1:43:35.280 --> 1:43:42.800
 sort of to me personally happiness was just like swimming around the one that like is the political

1:43:42.800 --> 1:43:51.120
 stuff or the money stuff and all that or egos and i think that's probably what problem is as well

1:43:51.120 --> 1:43:57.120
 like the moment he senses there's any as what it feels metal like the moment you start to have any

1:43:57.120 --> 1:44:03.280
 kind of drama around credit assignment all those kinds of things it's almost not that it's important

1:44:03.280 --> 1:44:08.320
 who gets the credit it's like the drama in itself gets in the way of the exploration of the ideas

1:44:08.320 --> 1:44:13.680
 or the fundamental thing that makes science so damn beautiful and and you can really see that

1:44:13.680 --> 1:44:21.120
 is also a product of that russian school of like doing science and you can see that that um that

1:44:21.120 --> 1:44:26.640
 people were you know during the cold war a lot of mathematicians they were not making any money they

1:44:26.640 --> 1:44:33.280
 were doing math for the sake of math like for the intellectual pleasure of like solving a difficult

1:44:33.280 --> 1:44:38.080
 problem yeah and you know even even if it was a flawed system and there were a lot of problems with

1:44:38.080 --> 1:44:43.840
 with that there's these they were able to to actually achieve these and there were a lot of

1:44:43.840 --> 1:44:49.840
 and perelman for me is the perfect product of that he just cared about like working on tough problems

1:44:49.840 --> 1:44:56.480
 he didn't care about anything else it was just math you know pure math yeah there's a like for

1:44:56.480 --> 1:45:02.160
 the broader audience i think another example of that is like professional sports versus olympics

1:45:02.160 --> 1:45:09.280
 i've especially in russia i've seen that clear distinction where because the state manages

1:45:10.480 --> 1:45:16.560
 so much of the olympic process in russia as people know with the steroids yes yes yes but outside

1:45:16.560 --> 1:45:25.440
 of steroids thing uh is like the athlete can focus on the pure artistry of the sport like

1:45:26.400 --> 1:45:31.040
 like not worry about the money not just in the way they talk about it the way they think about it the

1:45:31.040 --> 1:45:38.400
 way they define excellence versus like in the perhaps a bit of a capitalist system in united

1:45:38.400 --> 1:45:46.640
 states with american football with baseball basketball so much of the discussion is about

1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:53.040
 money now of course at the end of the day it's about excellence and artistry and all that but

1:45:53.040 --> 1:45:58.080
 when the culture is so richly grounded in discussions of money and

1:45:58.080 --> 1:46:04.880
 uh sort of this capitalistic like uh merch and uh businesses and all those kinds of things

1:46:04.880 --> 1:46:11.120
 it changes the nature of the activity and it's in a way that's hard again to describe in words but

1:46:11.120 --> 1:46:18.960
 when it's purely about the activity itself it's almost like you quiet down all the noise

1:46:18.960 --> 1:46:23.680
 enough to hear the signal enough to hear the beauty like whenever you're talking about the

1:46:23.680 --> 1:46:28.640
 like whenever you're talking about the money that's when the marketing people come and the

1:46:28.640 --> 1:46:32.880
 business people the non creatives come and they fill the room and there's and they create drama

1:46:32.880 --> 1:46:36.880
 and they know how to create the drama and the noise as opposed to the people who are truly

1:46:36.880 --> 1:46:44.480
 excellent at what they do the the person in their arena right like when you remove all the money

1:46:44.480 --> 1:46:51.600
 and you just let that thing shine that's when true excellence can and can come out and that was

1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:56.480
 one of the few things that worked with the communist system in the Soviet Union to me at

1:46:56.480 --> 1:47:03.840
 least as somebody who loves sport and loves mathematics and uh science that worked well

1:47:03.840 --> 1:47:11.920
 removing the money from the picture uh you know not that I'm um not that I'm saying poverty is

1:47:11.920 --> 1:47:18.960
 good for science there's some level in which not worrying about money is good for science it's a

1:47:18.960 --> 1:47:24.400
 weird I'm not exactly sure what to make of that because capitalism works really damn well yeah but

1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:32.240
 it's um it's tricky how to find that balance one field's medalist that is interesting to look at

1:47:32.240 --> 1:47:37.600
 and I think you mentioned it earlier but it's CÃ©dric Villani which is might be the only uh

1:47:38.080 --> 1:47:43.840
 field's medalist that is also a politician now but so it's this it's this brilliant French

1:47:43.840 --> 1:47:51.920
 mathematician that won the field's medal and and after that he decided that one of the ways that

1:47:51.920 --> 1:47:58.000
 he could have could have uh you know the biggest leverage kind of is in pushing science in the

1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:04.480
 direction that he thinks science should go would be to to try to go into politics and so that's

1:48:04.480 --> 1:48:11.360
 what he did and and uh and he has ran I'm not sure if he has won any election but I think he's running

1:48:11.360 --> 1:48:15.440
 I think he's running for mayor for mayor of Paris or something like that but it's this brilliant

1:48:15.440 --> 1:48:22.240
 mathematician that uh that uh before winning the field's medal had only been just a brilliant

1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:27.520
 mathematician but but after that he decided to go into politics to to try to to have an impact and

1:48:27.520 --> 1:48:33.440
 try to change some of the things that he he would complain about um before so so there's that

1:48:33.440 --> 1:48:40.400
 component as well yeah and I've always thought mathematics and science should be like like James

1:48:40.400 --> 1:48:48.160
 Bond would in my eyes I think be sexier if he did math like we should as a society put

1:48:49.040 --> 1:48:53.840
 excellence in mathematics at the same level as being able to kill a man with your bare hands

1:48:53.840 --> 1:48:59.840
 like those are both useful features like that's admirable it's like oh like that makes you like

1:48:59.840 --> 1:49:05.520
 that makes the person interesting like being extremely well read about history or philosophy

1:49:05.520 --> 1:49:10.720
 being good at mathematics being able to kill a man with bare hands these are all the same in my book

1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:16.640
 so I think all are useful for action stars uh and I think the society will benefit for uh for giving

1:49:16.640 --> 1:49:24.880
 more value to that like one of the things that bothers me about American culture is the I don't

1:49:24.880 --> 1:49:32.320
 know the right words to use but like the nerdiness associated with science like like in I I don't

1:49:32.320 --> 1:49:40.400
 think nerd is a good word in in American culture because uh it's seen as like weakness there's like

1:49:40.400 --> 1:49:47.280
 images that come with that and it's fine you could you could be all kinds of shapes and colors and

1:49:47.280 --> 1:49:55.120
 personalities but like to me uh having sophisticated knowledge in science being good at math

1:49:56.160 --> 1:50:01.840
 doesn't mean you're weak in fact it could be the very opposite and so it's it's an

1:50:01.840 --> 1:50:07.600
 interesting thing because it was very much differently viewed in the uh in the Soviet Union

1:50:07.600 --> 1:50:14.480
 so I know for sure as an existence proof that uh it doesn't have to be that way but it um

1:50:15.440 --> 1:50:22.000
 I also feel like we lack a lot of role models in terms if you ask people are mentioned to mention

1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:26.400
 one mathematician that they know that is alive today I think a lot of people would struggle

1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:36.960
 to answer that question um and I also think I love Neil deGrasse Tyson okay but there is uh

1:50:38.080 --> 1:50:44.000
 having more role models is good like different kinds of personalities he he has kind of fun and

1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:49.760
 and it's very it's uh like Bill Nye the science guy I don't know if you guys know him so like that

1:50:49.760 --> 1:50:56.880
 spectrum that yeah but there there's not like Feynman is no longer there uh those kinds of

1:50:56.880 --> 1:51:05.120
 personality Carl Sagan even Carl Sagan yeah like a seriousness that's like not playful like not

1:51:05.120 --> 1:51:12.800
 apologetical yeah exactly not apologetic about being knowledgeable like like in fact like the

1:51:12.800 --> 1:51:21.920
 kind of energy where you feel uh self conscious about not having thought about some of these

1:51:21.920 --> 1:51:28.400
 questions right just like when I see James Bond I feel bad about that I don't have never killed a

1:51:28.400 --> 1:51:33.280
 man like I need to make sure I fix that that's the way I feel the same way I want to feel like

1:51:33.280 --> 1:51:38.320
 that way well Carl Sagan talks I I feel like I need to have that same kind of seriousness about

1:51:38.320 --> 1:51:43.440
 science like if I don't know something I want to I want to know well what about Terrence Tao

1:51:44.160 --> 1:51:48.720
 he's kind of a superstar what are your thoughts about him true it's probably one of the most

1:51:48.720 --> 1:51:53.440
 famous mathematicians alive today and probably one of I mean regardless of like is of course

1:51:54.400 --> 1:52:02.640
 he won a field the Fields Medal is really smart and talented mathematician um it's also like a

1:52:02.640 --> 1:52:10.160
 big inspiration for us um at least for some of the work that we do with Fermat's library

1:52:10.160 --> 1:52:15.120
 so Terrence Tao is is known for having you know a big blog and he's pretty open about

1:52:15.920 --> 1:52:23.760
 um like his research and he also he tries to make his work as public as possible um through his blog

1:52:23.760 --> 1:52:30.400
 posts um in fact there's a really interesting um problem that got solved a couple of years ago

1:52:30.400 --> 1:52:36.800
 so Tao was working with uh on a problem on an Erdos problem actually so Paul Erdos was this

1:52:37.840 --> 1:52:44.800
 mathematician from Hungary and he was known for like um the Erdos for a lot of things but one of

1:52:44.800 --> 1:52:49.680
 the things that he was also known was for the Erdos problem so he was always like um creating

1:52:49.680 --> 1:52:54.000
 these problems and usually associating prizes with those problems and a lot of those problems

1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:58.080
 are still open like and and there will be some of them will be open for like maybe

1:52:58.080 --> 1:53:02.720
 a couple hundred years and I think that's actually an interesting hack for him to collaborate with

1:53:02.720 --> 1:53:08.880
 future mathematicians you know his his name will keep coming up and you know for future generations

1:53:08.880 --> 1:53:14.240
 but so Tao was working on one of these problems called the Erdos discrepancy and he published a

1:53:14.240 --> 1:53:21.600
 blog post on like uh about that problem about that problem and he reached like a dead end and then um

1:53:21.600 --> 1:53:26.640
 all of a sudden there was this guy from from Germany that wrote like a comment on his blog post

1:53:26.640 --> 1:53:32.800
 saying okay like some of the that so this problem is like a Sudoku like flavor and some of the

1:53:32.800 --> 1:53:38.400
 machinery that we're using to solve Sudoku could be used here and that was actually the key to

1:53:38.400 --> 1:53:43.440
 solve the Erdos discrepancy problem so the there was a comment on his blog and I think that that

1:53:43.440 --> 1:53:50.480
 that for me is an example of like how to do again going back to collaborative science online um and

1:53:50.480 --> 1:53:57.760
 the power that it has but Tao is also like pretty public about like some of the struggles and of

1:53:57.760 --> 1:54:04.320
 of being a a mathematician like and and even he wrote about some of the unintended consequences

1:54:04.320 --> 1:54:10.880
 of having extraordinary ability in a field and he used himself as an example when he was growing up

1:54:10.880 --> 1:54:17.440
 he was extremely talented in in mathematics from a young age like Tao was a person he won an

1:54:17.440 --> 1:54:22.480
 uh medal in like one of the IMOs at the age I think was a gold medal at the age of 10 or something

1:54:22.480 --> 1:54:28.560
 like that and so he mentioned that when he was growing up like and especially in college when he

1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:34.080
 was in a class that he enjoyed it didn't it just came very natural for him and he didn't have to

1:54:34.080 --> 1:54:40.160
 work hard to just ace the class and when he found that the class was boring like it didn't work and

1:54:40.160 --> 1:54:47.760
 he barely passed barely passed even some I think in college he almost failed two classes and and

1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:53.280
 he was talking about that and how he brought those studying habits or like uh in existence of studying

1:54:53.280 --> 1:54:58.880
 habits when he went to Princeton Princeton for his PhD and in Princeton when he you know started kind

1:54:58.880 --> 1:55:05.920
 of um delving into more complex problems and classes he struggled a lot because he didn't have

1:55:05.920 --> 1:55:11.440
 that uh those those habits like he wasn't taking notes and he was he wasn't studying hard when he

1:55:11.440 --> 1:55:18.080
 when he faced problems and he almost failed out of his his PhD uh he almost failed his PhD exam

1:55:18.080 --> 1:55:23.280
 and um it it talks about like having this conversation with with his advisor and the

1:55:23.280 --> 1:55:28.160
 advisor pointing out like you're not this is not working you you might have to get out of the

1:55:28.160 --> 1:55:35.680
 program and like how that was a kind of a turning point for him and um he was like you know he was

1:55:35.680 --> 1:55:41.200
 um and like it was super important in his career so I think Tao is also like this figure that apart

1:55:41.200 --> 1:55:46.080
 from being just an exceptional mathematician he's also pretty open about you know what what it takes

1:55:46.080 --> 1:55:50.880
 to to to be a mathematician and some of the struggles of this type of careers and and I think

1:55:50.880 --> 1:55:56.880
 it's that's super important in many ways he's a contributor to open science and open humanity

1:55:56.880 --> 1:56:03.200
 so he's being an open human true by communicating uh Scott Aaronson is another in computer science

1:56:03.200 --> 1:56:08.400
 world who's a very different style very different style but there's something about a blog that

1:56:09.280 --> 1:56:15.760
 is authentic and real and just gives us a window into the into the mind and soul of of of these

1:56:15.760 --> 1:56:20.720
 brilliant folks so it's it's definitely a gift let me ask you about Fermat's library on twitter

1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:27.200
 which uh I mean I don't know how to describe it people should definitely just follow Fermat's

1:56:27.200 --> 1:56:35.280
 library on twitter I keep following and unfollowing from his library because because uh it's so

1:56:35.920 --> 1:56:46.080
 it it gives when I follow it um leads me on down rabbit holes often that um that um that are very

1:56:46.080 --> 1:56:53.360
 fruitful but but anyway so the the posts you do with the on twitter are just these beautiful

1:56:53.360 --> 1:57:00.960
 are things that reveal some beautiful aspect of mathematics um is there um is there something you

1:57:00.960 --> 1:57:10.080
 could say about the approach there yeah and um maybe maybe broadly what you find beautiful about

1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:17.120
 mathematics and then more specifically how you convert that into a rigorous process of revealing

1:57:17.120 --> 1:57:22.560
 that in tweet form that's a good point I think there's something about math that you know a lot

1:57:22.560 --> 1:57:28.560
 you know a lot of the mathematical content and you know papers or like little proofs um you know

1:57:29.360 --> 1:57:36.000
 has in a way sort of an infinite half life what I mean by that is that if you look at like Euclid's

1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:42.720
 elements it's as valid today as it was when it was created like 2000 years ago and that's not true

1:57:42.720 --> 1:57:51.920
 for a lot of other scientific fields um and so in regards to twitter I think there's also a very

1:57:51.920 --> 1:57:58.960
 it's a very under under explored platform from a learning perspective I think if you look at

1:57:58.960 --> 1:58:07.040
 content on twitter it's very easy to consume it's very easy to read um and especially when you're

1:58:07.600 --> 1:58:12.960
 trying to explain something you know we humans get a dopamine hit if we learn something new

1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:20.000
 and that's a very very powerful feeling and that's why you know people go to classes when

1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:24.640
 you have a really good professor you know it's looking for those dopamine hits and

1:58:25.840 --> 1:58:31.280
 and and that's something that we try to explore when we're producing content on twitter imagine

1:58:31.280 --> 1:58:36.960
 if we could if you would on a line to a restaurant you could go go to your phone to learn something

1:58:36.960 --> 1:58:44.640
 new instead of social going to a you know social network and to just and so and I think it's very

1:58:44.640 --> 1:58:51.680
 hard to to sometimes to kind of provide that feeling because you need to sometimes digest

1:58:51.680 --> 1:58:58.960
 content and and put it um in a way you know that it feeds 280 characters um and and it requires a

1:58:58.960 --> 1:59:04.880
 lot of sometimes time to do that uh even though it's easy to consume it's hard to make but once

1:59:04.880 --> 1:59:10.960
 you are able to to provide that eureka moment to people like that's very powerful they get that

1:59:10.960 --> 1:59:16.320
 dopamine hit and like you create this feedback cycle and people come back for for more and in

1:59:16.320 --> 1:59:21.200
 twitter compared to like you know an online course for a book you have a zero percent dropout so

1:59:21.200 --> 1:59:27.440
 people will read the content the content so that it's it's like it's part of the creators like the

1:59:27.440 --> 1:59:32.160
 person that is creating the content if you're able to actually get that feedback cycle it's

1:59:32.160 --> 1:59:38.080
 super super powerful yeah but some of the stuff is like like how the heck do you find that and

1:59:38.080 --> 1:59:44.240
 and i don't know why it's so appealing it uh like uh this is from uh what is it

1:59:45.760 --> 1:59:53.120
 a couple days ago i'll just read out the number 23456789 is the largest prime number with

1:59:53.120 --> 2:00:00.800
 consecutive increasing digits i mean that is so cool that's like some weird like glimpse

2:00:00.800 --> 2:00:07.440
 into some deep universal truth even though it's just a number i mean that's like so arbitrary

2:00:07.440 --> 2:00:12.880
 like why why is it so pleasant that that's a thing but it is in some way it's almost like

2:00:12.880 --> 2:00:19.920
 it is a little glimpse at some much bigger like um and and i think like especially if we're talking

2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:25.440
 about science there's something unique about you go and with a lot of the tweets you go sometimes

2:00:25.440 --> 2:00:30.960
 from a state of not knowing something to knowing something and that is very particular to science

2:00:30.960 --> 2:00:37.200
 math physics and that again is extra extremely addictive and that's that's how i i i i feel about

2:00:37.200 --> 2:00:43.920
 that and um that's why i think people engage so much with with our tweets and go into rabbit holes

2:00:43.920 --> 2:00:49.200
 and then they you know we start with prime numbers and all of a sudden you are spending hours reading

2:00:49.200 --> 2:00:56.000
 number theory things and you go into wikipedia and you lose a lot of time there but uh well the

2:00:56.000 --> 2:01:01.680
 variety is really interesting too there's human things there's uh there's physics things there's

2:01:01.680 --> 2:01:07.600
 like numeric things like i just mentioned but there's also more rigorous mathematical things

2:01:08.240 --> 2:01:12.720
 there's stuff that's tied to the history of math and the proofs and there's visual there's

2:01:12.720 --> 2:01:17.600
 animations uh there are looping animations that are incredible that reveal something

2:01:17.600 --> 2:01:24.960
 there's uh andrew wiles on being smart this is just me now like ignoring you guys is just going

2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:29.840
 through yeah we're a bit like math drug dealers we're just trying to get you hooked we're trying

2:01:29.840 --> 2:01:35.120
 to give you that hit and trying to get you hooked yes some people are brighter than others but i

2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:40.320
 really believe that most people can really get to to quite a good level of mathematics if they're

2:01:40.320 --> 2:01:45.440
 prepared to deal with these psychological issues of how to handle the situation of being stuck

2:01:45.440 --> 2:01:51.600
 yeah there's some truth to that that's truth i feel that's like really it's some truth in terms

2:01:51.600 --> 2:01:57.120
 of research and also about startups you're stuck a lot of the time before you you get to a

2:01:57.120 --> 2:02:02.320
 breakthrough and and it's difficult to endure that process of like being stuck and because you're not

2:02:02.320 --> 2:02:09.040
 trained to to be in that position um i feel uh yeah that's yeah most people are broken by the

2:02:09.040 --> 2:02:16.720
 stuckness or like their district like uh i i've i've been very cognizant of the fact that

2:02:17.760 --> 2:02:24.960
 more and more social media becomes a thing like distractions become a thing that that moment of

2:02:24.960 --> 2:02:32.400
 being stuck is uh your mind wants to to go do stuff that's unrelated to being stuck and you

2:02:32.400 --> 2:02:39.040
 should be stuck i'm referring to small stucknesses like you're like trying to design something and

2:02:39.040 --> 2:02:44.000
 it's a dead end basically little dead ends dead ends of programming dead ends and trying to think

2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:50.640
 through something and then your mind wants to like like like uh this is the problem this like

2:02:51.440 --> 2:02:58.640
 work life balance culture is like take a break like as if taking a break will solve everything

2:02:58.640 --> 2:03:02.560
 sometimes it solves quite a bit but like sometimes you need to sit in the stuckness and suffer a

2:03:02.560 --> 2:03:08.880
 little bit and then take a break but you you definitely need to be this and like most people

2:03:08.880 --> 2:03:17.680
 quit from that psychological battle being stuck so success is people who who who uh persevere

2:03:17.680 --> 2:03:22.880
 through that yeah yeah and and in the creative process that's also true i was the other day i

2:03:22.880 --> 2:03:28.400
 was i think was reading about is this um what is his name ed sheeran like the musician yeah was

2:03:28.400 --> 2:03:33.120
 talking a little bit about the creative process and using was using this analogy of a faucet like

2:03:33.120 --> 2:03:38.800
 where you when you turn on a faucet is as like the dirty water coming out in the beginning and you

2:03:38.800 --> 2:03:45.120
 just have to you know keep trusting that at some point your clean clean clear water will come out

2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:50.000
 but you have to endure that process like in the beginning it's going to be dirty water and and and

2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:56.400
 just you know embrace that yeah actually this uh the entirety of my youtube channel and this

2:03:56.400 --> 2:04:02.640
 podcast have been following that philosophy of dirty water like i've been you know i do believe

2:04:02.640 --> 2:04:08.000
 that like you have to get all the crap out of your system first and uh sometimes it it's it's all

2:04:08.560 --> 2:04:14.880
 sometimes it's all crappy work i tend to be very self critical but i do think that quantity leads

2:04:14.880 --> 2:04:20.240
 to quality for some people it does for my the way my mind works is like just keep putting stuff out

2:04:20.240 --> 2:04:28.880
 there keep creating and uh the quality will come as opposed to sitting there waiting not doing

2:04:28.880 --> 2:04:35.600
 anything until the thing seems perfect because the perfect may never come but just just on like on

2:04:35.600 --> 2:04:40.480
 on on our twitter like profile i really and sometimes when you look on some of those tweets

2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:47.360
 they might seem like pretty kind of um you know why is this interesting it's like so raw uh like

2:04:47.360 --> 2:04:53.680
 it's just a number but i really believe that especially with math or physics it is possible

2:04:53.680 --> 2:04:59.600
 to get everyone to love math or physics even if you think you hate it it's it's not a function of

2:04:59.600 --> 2:05:04.240
 the student or the person that is on the other side i think is just purely a function of like

2:05:04.240 --> 2:05:11.040
 how you explain uh hidden beauty that they hadn't realized before it's not easy but i think it's

2:05:11.040 --> 2:05:16.880
 like a lot of the times it's on like on the creator's side to to be able to like show that

2:05:16.880 --> 2:05:22.800
 beauty to the other person i think some of that is native to to humans we just have that curiosity

2:05:22.800 --> 2:05:28.000
 and you look at small toddlers and babies and like them trying to figure things out and there's

2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:32.880
 just something that is born with us that we we we want for that understanding of the world

2:05:32.880 --> 2:05:38.480
 we want for that understanding we want to figure out the world around us and and so yeah it shouldn't

2:05:38.480 --> 2:05:45.680
 be like uh whether or not people are going are going to to enjoy it like i i i also really

2:05:45.680 --> 2:05:51.680
 believe that everybody has that capacity to fall in love with with math and physics you mentioned

2:05:51.680 --> 2:05:58.960
 startup what do you think it takes to build a successful startup yeah that it's what what

2:05:58.960 --> 2:06:06.080
 luis was saying that um you need to in to be able to endure being stuck and and i think the best way

2:06:06.080 --> 2:06:14.000
 to put it is that startups don't have a linear reward function right you oftentimes don't get

2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:21.760
 rewarded for effort and and and most of our lives we go through these processes that do

2:06:22.640 --> 2:06:27.200
 give you those small rewards for effort right in school you study hard generally you'll get a good

2:06:27.200 --> 2:06:33.040
 grade and then you good you get like good grades ever or you get grades every semester and so you're

2:06:33.040 --> 2:06:40.400
 slowly getting rewarded and pushed in the right direction for for startups and startups are not

2:06:40.400 --> 2:06:45.280
 the only thing that is like this but for startups it's you know you can put in a ton of effort into

2:06:45.280 --> 2:06:51.200
 something that and then get no reward for it right it's it's like like sisyphus boulder where you're

2:06:51.200 --> 2:06:57.360
 pushing that boulder up the mountain and and and you get to the top and then it just rolls all the

2:06:57.360 --> 2:07:02.480
 way back down and and so that's something that i think a lot of people are not equipped to deal

2:07:02.480 --> 2:07:10.560
 with and can be incredibly demoralizing especially if that happens more than than a few times and so

2:07:10.560 --> 2:07:16.800
 but i think it's absolutely essential to to power through it because um by the nature of startups

2:07:16.800 --> 2:07:23.040
 it's oftentimes you know you're dealing with with with non obvious ideas and things that

2:07:23.040 --> 2:07:28.720
 there might be contrarian and so you're gonna you're gonna run into into that a lot you're

2:07:28.720 --> 2:07:33.760
 gonna do things that are not gonna work out and you need to be prepared to deal with that but

2:07:34.400 --> 2:07:38.800
 but if we're not coming out of college you're you're just not equipped i'm not sure if there's

2:07:38.800 --> 2:07:45.360
 a way to train people to deal with those nonlinear reward functions but it's definitely i think one

2:07:45.360 --> 2:07:51.440
 of the most difficult things to you know about doing a startup and also happens in research

2:07:51.440 --> 2:07:56.480
 sometimes you know we're talking about the default state is being stuck you just you know you don't

2:07:56.480 --> 2:08:02.080
 like you try things you get zero results you close doors you constantly closing doors until you you

2:08:02.080 --> 2:08:08.000
 know find something and um yeah that is a big thing what about sort of this point when you're

2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:15.520
 stuck there's a kind of decision whether if you have a vision to persist through with this direction

2:08:15.520 --> 2:08:21.680
 that you've been going along or what a lot of startups do or businesses is pivot how do you

2:08:21.680 --> 2:08:29.920
 decide whether like to give up on a particular flavor of the way you've imagined the design

2:08:29.920 --> 2:08:38.560
 and to like adjust it or completely like alter it i think that's a core question for startups that

2:08:38.560 --> 2:08:44.160
 i've asked myself exactly and like i i've never been able to come up with a great framework to

2:08:44.160 --> 2:08:51.120
 make those decisions um i think that's really at the core of uh yeah out of a lot of the the

2:08:51.120 --> 2:08:57.840
 toughest questions that that people that's that started a company you have to deal with um i think

2:08:57.840 --> 2:09:03.200
 maybe the best framework that i i have was able to figure out like when you run out of ideas

2:09:04.080 --> 2:09:09.360
 you just you know you're exploring something is not working you try it in a different angle uh

2:09:09.360 --> 2:09:14.320
 you know we try a different business model when you run out of ideas like you don't have any more

2:09:14.320 --> 2:09:22.560
 cards just switch and yeah it's not perfect because you also it's you have a lot of stories

2:09:22.560 --> 2:09:29.520
 of startups is like people kept pushing and then you know that paid off and then you have uh

2:09:29.520 --> 2:09:36.720
 philosophies is like fail fast and pivot fast um so it's you know it's hard to you know balance

2:09:36.720 --> 2:09:42.000
 these two worlds and understand what is the best framework and i mean if you look at for miles

2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:48.080
 library you're maybe you can correct me but it feels like you're an operating in a space

2:09:48.080 --> 2:09:53.840
 where there's a lot of things that are broken and or could be significantly improved so it

2:09:53.840 --> 2:10:00.240
 feels like there's a lot of possibilities for pivoting or like how do you revolutionize science

2:10:00.240 --> 2:10:08.240
 how do you revolutionize the aggregation the the annotation the commenting the community around

2:10:08.240 --> 2:10:13.520
 information of knowledge structured knowledge i mean that's kind of what like stack overflow

2:10:13.520 --> 2:10:19.200
 and stack exchange has struggled with to come up with a solution and they've come up i think with

2:10:19.200 --> 2:10:23.680
 an interesting set of solutions that are also i think flawed in some ways but they're much much

2:10:23.680 --> 2:10:29.280
 better than the alternatives but there's a lot of other possibilities if we just look at papers as

2:10:29.280 --> 2:10:33.440
 we talked about there's so many possible revolutions and they're a lot of money to be

2:10:33.440 --> 2:10:39.760
 potentially made those revolutions plus coupled with that the benefit to humanity and so like

2:10:39.760 --> 2:10:45.440
 you're sitting there like i don't know how many people are legitimately from a business perspective

2:10:45.440 --> 2:10:50.880
 playing with these ideas it feels like there's a lot of ideas here true it varies are you right

2:10:50.880 --> 2:10:55.680
 now grinding in a particular direction like is there a video like a five year vision that you're

2:10:55.680 --> 2:11:03.040
 thinking in your mind for us it's more like a 20 year vision in the sense that uh we we've

2:11:03.040 --> 2:11:10.880
 consciously tried to make the decision of so we so we run formats as it's a side project and it's

2:11:10.880 --> 2:11:18.720
 separate in the sense like it's not what we're working on full time and uh but our thesis there

2:11:18.720 --> 2:11:24.880
 is that we actually think that it's that's a good thing at least for for this stage of formats

2:11:24.880 --> 2:11:32.480
 library um and also because some of these projects you just if you're coming from a start from a

2:11:32.480 --> 2:11:40.240
 startup framework you probably try to try to fit every single idea into something that can change

2:11:40.240 --> 2:11:45.360
 the world within three to five years and there's just some problems that take longer than that

2:11:45.360 --> 2:11:51.200
 right and so you know we're talking about archive and i'm very doubtful that you could grow like

2:11:51.200 --> 2:11:56.480
 archive into what it is today like within two or three years no matter how much money you throw at

2:11:56.480 --> 2:12:02.880
 it there's just some things that can take longer but you need to be able to power through the the

2:12:02.880 --> 2:12:08.080
 that the time that it takes um but if you look at it as okay this is a company this is a startup

2:12:08.080 --> 2:12:14.080
 we have to grow fast we have to raise money then uh then sometimes you might forego those ideas

2:12:14.080 --> 2:12:22.080
 because of that um because they don't very well fit into the the typical startup framework and

2:12:22.080 --> 2:12:27.840
 so for us formats it's something that we're okay with growing with having it grow slowly and and

2:12:27.840 --> 2:12:34.240
 maybe taking many years and and and that's why we think it's it's not a bad thing that it is a side

2:12:34.240 --> 2:12:41.600
 project because it makes it much more um acceptable in a way and that to to be able to be okay with

2:12:41.600 --> 2:12:48.400
 that that said i think what happens is if you keep pushing new little features new little ideas

2:12:48.400 --> 2:12:54.880
 i feel like there's like certain ideas will just become viral like and then you just won't be able

2:12:54.880 --> 2:13:00.320
 to help yourself but it'll revolutionize things it feels like there needs to be not needs to be

2:13:00.320 --> 2:13:08.720
 but there's um opportunity for viral ideas to change science absolutely and maybe we don't know

2:13:08.720 --> 2:13:13.440
 what those are yet it might be a very small kind of thing maybe you don't even know if should this

2:13:13.440 --> 2:13:19.840
 be a for profit company doing these it's the wikipedia question yeah um is that there are a lot

2:13:19.840 --> 2:13:24.880
 of questions like really fundamental questions about this space um that we've we've talked about

2:13:24.880 --> 2:13:29.280
 i mean you take wikipedia and you try to run it as a startup and by now we'd have a paywall you'd be

2:13:29.280 --> 2:13:34.800
 paying 9.99 a month to to read more than 20 articles i mean that's that's one view yeah the

2:13:34.800 --> 2:13:41.920
 other the ad driven model so they rejected the ad driven model i don't know if we could i mean this

2:13:41.920 --> 2:13:48.960
 is a difficult question you know if archive was supported by ads i don't know if that's bad for

2:13:48.960 --> 2:13:55.440
 archive if for mass library was supported by ads i don't know i don't i'm not it's not trivial to

2:13:55.440 --> 2:14:02.640
 me i'm unlike i think a lot of people uh i'm not against advertisements i think ads when done

2:14:02.640 --> 2:14:06.640
 well are really good i think the problem with facebook and all the social networks are the way

2:14:07.200 --> 2:14:12.880
 the lack of transparency around the way they use data and uh the lack of control the users have

2:14:12.880 --> 2:14:18.240
 over their data not the fact that data is being collected and used to sell advertisements it's a

2:14:18.240 --> 2:14:23.040
 lack of transparency lack of control if you if you do a good job with that i feel like it's really

2:14:23.040 --> 2:14:29.200
 nice way to make stuff free yeah it's like stack overflow right i mean i think they've done a okay

2:14:29.200 --> 2:14:33.920
 a good job with that uh even though as we said like they're capturing very little of the value

2:14:33.920 --> 2:14:39.920
 that they're putting out there right but but it makes it a sustainable company and and they're

2:14:39.920 --> 2:14:46.960
 providing a lot of it's a fantastic and very productive community let me ask a a ridiculous

2:14:46.960 --> 2:14:53.520
 tangent of a question please you wrote a paper on uh on game of thrones battle of winterfell just

2:14:53.520 --> 2:15:02.080
 as a side little i i'm sorry i noticed i'm sure you've done a lot of ridiculous stuff like this i

2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:08.240
 just noticed that particular one by ridiculous i mean ridiculously awesome can you describe the uh

2:15:08.240 --> 2:15:14.000
 the approach in this work which i believe is a legitimate publication so going back to the

2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:18.720
 original like uh when we were talking about the backstory of of papers and the importance of that

2:15:18.720 --> 2:15:25.760
 you know there was a when the last season of the the show was airing uh this was a during a company

2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:32.880
 lunch we there was in in the last season there's the there's a really big battle against the the

2:15:32.880 --> 2:15:39.920
 forces of evil and the you know the forces of good and it's called the battle of winterfell

2:15:39.920 --> 2:15:46.160
 and um in this battle there are like these two armies and there's a very particular thing that

2:15:46.160 --> 2:15:51.360
 they have to take into account is that in the army of dead like if someone dies in the army of

2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:59.200
 the living uh like that person is gonna you know be a reborn as a soldier in the army of the dead

2:15:59.200 --> 2:16:04.000
 yes and so that was a an important thing to take into account and the initial conditions as you

2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:08.800
 specify it's about a hundred thousand on each side exactly so i was able i was able to like based on

2:16:08.800 --> 2:16:13.200
 some images or like on previous episodes to figure out what was the size of the armies and so what i

2:16:13.200 --> 2:16:19.760
 want what we wanted to what we were theorizing was like how many soldiers does like a soldier

2:16:19.760 --> 2:16:26.880
 on the army of the living has to kill in order for them to be able to destroy the army of the dead

2:16:26.880 --> 2:16:33.280
 without like losing because every time one of the good soldiers dies gonna turn into like the other

2:16:33.280 --> 2:16:39.120
 side and so it's so i we we were theorizing that and and i wrote wrote a couple of differential

2:16:39.120 --> 2:16:43.840
 equations and i was able to figure out that based on the size of the armies i think i think was the

2:16:43.840 --> 2:16:50.560
 ratio had to be like 1.7 so it had to kill like 1.7 soldiers like the army of the dead in order

2:16:50.560 --> 2:16:57.520
 for them to win the battle well yeah that's that's science it is it's it's the most powerful

2:16:58.160 --> 2:17:05.680
 and this is also somehow a pitch for uh like a hiring pitch in a sense like this is the kind of

2:17:05.680 --> 2:17:11.840
 yeah important science you do exactly well turned out to be you know as as for people that have

2:17:11.840 --> 2:17:16.240
 watched these shows is like they know that every time you try to predict something that is going

2:17:16.240 --> 2:17:20.240
 to happen it's going to you're going to fail miserably and that's what happened so it was not

2:17:20.240 --> 2:17:26.160
 not at all important for the show but yeah we ended up like putting that out and there was a

2:17:26.160 --> 2:17:30.480
 lot of people that share that i think was some like elements of the of the show the cast of the

2:17:30.480 --> 2:17:35.760
 show that actually retweeted that and shared that that first one was fun i would love if this kind

2:17:35.760 --> 2:17:43.440
 of calculation happened uh like during the making of the show or you know i love it like in um

2:17:44.720 --> 2:17:51.040
 for example i i now know uh alex garland the director of ex machina and i love it he doesn't

2:17:51.040 --> 2:17:58.400
 seem to be some not many people seem to do this but i love it when directors and people who wrote

2:17:58.400 --> 2:18:04.960
 the story really think through the technical details like whether it's knowing like how things

2:18:04.960 --> 2:18:10.160
 even if it's science fiction if you were to try to do this how would you do this uh like

2:18:10.160 --> 2:18:16.320
 stephen wolfram and his son were um were collaborating with the movie arrival in

2:18:16.320 --> 2:18:21.840
 designing the alien language how you communicate with aliens like how would you really have

2:18:21.840 --> 2:18:31.200
 uh a math based language that uh that could span the alien and uh being and the human being so i

2:18:31.200 --> 2:18:35.120
 i love it when they have that kind of rigor the martian was also big on that like the book and

2:18:35.120 --> 2:18:41.280
 the movie was all about like can we actually you know is this plausible can this happen it was all

2:18:41.280 --> 2:18:46.960
 about that and that can really bring you in like the sometimes those small details uh i mean the

2:18:46.960 --> 2:18:52.320
 i mean the the guy that wrote the martian book is another book uh that is also filled with those

2:18:52.320 --> 2:18:58.720
 like things that when you realize that okay these are grounded in in science can just really bring

2:18:58.720 --> 2:19:04.720
 you in yeah like the like the he has a book about a colony on the colony on the moon and he goes

2:19:04.720 --> 2:19:09.280
 about like all the details that would you know be required about setting up a colony in the moon

2:19:09.280 --> 2:19:14.960
 and like things that he wouldn't think about like the the fact that um they would you know it's

2:19:14.960 --> 2:19:21.360
 hard to bring like uh air to the moon say so they wouldn't like how do you make that breathable that

2:19:21.360 --> 2:19:26.800
 environment breathable you need to bring oxygen but like you you you probably wouldn't be bring

2:19:26.800 --> 2:19:34.240
 nitrogen so what you do is like instead of having a an atmosphere that is 100 oxygen you like

2:19:34.240 --> 2:19:39.760
 decrease the pressure so that you have the same ratio of oxygen on earth but like lowering the

2:19:39.760 --> 2:19:45.840
 pressure here and so like things like water boils at the lower temperature so people would would

2:19:45.840 --> 2:19:50.880
 have coffee and the coffee would be colder like there was a problem in this uh environment in

2:19:50.880 --> 2:19:57.360
 the moon so like and these are like small things in the book but i studied physics so like when i

2:19:57.360 --> 2:20:04.080
 read these like that throws me into like uh tangents and i start researching that and it's

2:20:04.080 --> 2:20:11.520
 like i really like to read books and watch movies when they go to that level of detail uh about

2:20:11.520 --> 2:20:15.760
 science yeah i think interstellar was one where they also consulted heavily with with a number of

2:20:15.760 --> 2:20:20.560
 yeah i think even resulted in a couple of papers a couple of papers about like the black hole

2:20:20.560 --> 2:20:27.360
 um visualizations and um yeah but there isn't and there's even more examples of interesting science

2:20:27.360 --> 2:20:33.680
 around like these fantasy we were reading at some point like these guys that were trying to figure

2:20:33.680 --> 2:20:42.480
 out if if the tolkien's middle earth if it was uh round if it was like a sphere yeah it's like a

2:20:42.480 --> 2:20:50.240
 flat based on the map based on the map and some of the references in the in the books and so uh

2:20:50.240 --> 2:20:54.480
 yeah we actually i think we tweeted about that you can yeah we did based on the distance between the

2:20:54.480 --> 2:21:00.320
 cities you can actually prove that that could be like a map of a sphere or like a spheroid

2:21:00.320 --> 2:21:09.680
 and and you can actually calculate the radius of that planet uh that's fascinating i mean yeah

2:21:09.680 --> 2:21:16.880
 that's fascinating but there's something about like calculating the number like exactly the

2:21:16.880 --> 2:21:23.120
 calculation you did for the battle winterfell is um something fascinating about that because

2:21:23.120 --> 2:21:30.640
 that's not like being that's very mathematical versus like grounded in physics and that's really

2:21:30.640 --> 2:21:38.400
 interesting i mean that's like injecting mathematics into fantasy there's there's something um i see

2:21:38.400 --> 2:21:42.640
 what you're saying about that and and that for me that's why i think it's also when you look at

2:21:42.640 --> 2:21:49.440
 things like like Fermat's last theorem like problems that are very kind of self contained

2:21:49.440 --> 2:21:54.160
 and simple to study i think like that's the same with that paper it's very easy to understand the

2:21:54.160 --> 2:22:01.760
 boundaries of the problem you know um and and that for me that's why those and that's why math is so

2:22:01.760 --> 2:22:06.480
 appealing and those like problems are also so appealing to the general public it's not that

2:22:06.480 --> 2:22:12.320
 they look simple or that people think that they are easy to like solve but i feel that a lot of

2:22:12.320 --> 2:22:18.240
 the times they are almost intellectually democratic because everyone understands the starting point

2:22:18.240 --> 2:22:23.360
 you know you look at Fermat's last theorem everyone understands like is this is the the

2:22:23.360 --> 2:22:27.440
 universe of the problem and the same maybe with that paper everyone understands okay these are

2:22:27.440 --> 2:22:34.320
 the starting conditions and um and and yeah that the fact that it becomes intellectually democratic

2:22:34.320 --> 2:22:39.760
 and i think that's a huge motivation for people and that's why so so many people gravitate towards

2:22:39.760 --> 2:22:44.080
 these like Riemann hypotheses or Fermat's last theorem or that simple paper which is like just

2:22:44.080 --> 2:22:48.960
 one page it was very simple and i just talked to somebody i don't know if you know who he is

2:22:48.960 --> 2:22:58.160
 Jocko Willink who was uh this person who among many things loves military tactics so he would

2:22:58.160 --> 2:23:04.080
 probably either publish a follow on paper maybe you guys should collaborate but he would see the

2:23:04.080 --> 2:23:09.200
 fundamental the basic assumptions that you started that paper with is flawed because you know there's

2:23:09.200 --> 2:23:15.280
 like dragons too right there's like like you have to integrate tactics because not it's not it's not

2:23:15.280 --> 2:23:20.400
 a homogeneous system it's not i don't take into account the dragons and like and he would say

2:23:20.400 --> 2:23:25.120
 tactics fundamentally change the dynamics of the system and so like that's what happened

2:23:27.600 --> 2:23:32.320
 so uh yeah so at least from a scientific perspective he was right but he never published

2:23:32.320 --> 2:23:36.480
 so there you go uh let me ask the most important question you guys are from

2:23:36.480 --> 2:23:44.320
 um portugal both yeah portugal uh so who is the greatest soccer player footballer of all time

2:23:45.520 --> 2:23:52.480
 yeah i think we're a little bit biased on this topic but i i mean i don't know i i have i have

2:23:52.480 --> 2:23:58.960
 a huge i have a you know tremendous respect for for what um here we go this is the political

2:23:59.840 --> 2:24:05.280
 you can convince you i i i mean i have tremendous respect for what ronaldo has achieved in his

2:24:05.280 --> 2:24:10.080
 career and and i think soccer is one of those sports where i think you can get to maybe be one

2:24:10.080 --> 2:24:16.800
 of the best players in the world we if you just have like natural talent and even if you don't put

2:24:16.800 --> 2:24:22.400
 a lot of hard work and discipline into soccer you can be one of the best players in the world

2:24:22.400 --> 2:24:27.600
 and i think ronaldo is kind of like of course he's naturally talented but he also ronaldo should say

2:24:27.600 --> 2:24:33.680
 the the football from exactly from portugal um and and not uh not the brazilian in this case

2:24:33.680 --> 2:24:39.600
 and so um and ronaldo put like came from nothing he is known from being probably one of the hardest

2:24:39.600 --> 2:24:44.560
 working athletes in the game and and i see that sometimes a lot of these discussions about the

2:24:44.560 --> 2:24:51.040
 best player a lot of people tend to gravitate towards like um you know this person is naturally

2:24:51.040 --> 2:24:58.240
 talented and the other person has to work hard and so and so as if it was bad if he had to work

2:24:58.240 --> 2:25:04.960
 hard to to be good at something and i think that you know the the i think so many people fall into

2:25:04.960 --> 2:25:10.400
 that trap and the reason why so many people fall into that trap is because if you're saying that

2:25:10.400 --> 2:25:17.040
 someone is good and achieved a lot of success by working hard as opposed to achieving success

2:25:17.040 --> 2:25:22.320
 because he has some sort of god given natural talent that you can't explain why the person was

2:25:22.320 --> 2:25:28.560
 born with that what does it tell you about you it tells you that maybe if you work hard on a lot of

2:25:28.560 --> 2:25:33.200
 fields you could have could accomplish a lot of great things and i think that's hard to digest

2:25:33.200 --> 2:25:38.800
 for a lot of people and and in that way ronaldo's inspiring that i think so you find hard work

2:25:39.520 --> 2:25:45.440
 inspiring but he's he's way too good looking that's that's the yeah i don't like him no i

2:25:45.440 --> 2:25:50.240
 like the part of the hard work and like of him being like one of the hardest working athletes

2:25:50.240 --> 2:25:56.000
 in in soccer so he is to you the greatest of all time is he up there is he would be number

2:25:56.000 --> 2:26:03.920
 okay do you agree with this thing well i definitely disagree i mean i i like him very much he works

2:26:03.920 --> 2:26:15.280
 hard i admire i admire you know um what like he's incredible uh goal scorer right um but i

2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:22.000
 i so first of all leo messi and there was some confusion because i've kept saying maradona is

2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:30.560
 my favorite player but i i think i think leo has surpassed them so uh um it's messy then maradona

2:26:30.560 --> 2:26:39.280
 then pelÃ© for me but the the reason is is um there's certain aesthetic definitions of beauty

2:26:39.280 --> 2:26:45.840
 that i admire whether it came by hard work or through god given talent or through anything and

2:26:45.840 --> 2:26:51.680
 it doesn't it doesn't really matter to me there's certain aesthetic like genius when i when i see it

2:26:51.680 --> 2:26:57.520
 to me and uh especially it doesn't have to be consistent it is in the case of messi in case

2:26:57.520 --> 2:27:04.880
 in the ronaldo but just even moments of genius which is where maradona really shines it i even

2:27:04.880 --> 2:27:09.840
 if that doesn't translate into like results and goals being scored right right and that's the

2:27:09.840 --> 2:27:17.520
 challenge like they did that uh because that's where people that tell me that leo messi's never

2:27:18.480 --> 2:27:24.320
 even on strong teams have led his the national team people as far as the world cup right as

2:27:24.320 --> 2:27:30.720
 really important and to me no it's the moment like winning to me was never important what's

2:27:30.720 --> 2:27:37.920
 more important is the moments of genius and but you're you're talking to the human story and

2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:44.080
 yeah christiano ronaldo definitely has a beautiful human story yeah and i think you can't

2:27:44.080 --> 2:27:49.920
 i for me it's hard to decouple those two um i don't i don't just look at you know the the

2:27:49.920 --> 2:27:54.960
 list of achievements but i like how he got there and how he keeps pushing the boundaries at like

2:27:54.960 --> 2:28:00.960
 almost 40 yeah and how that sets up an example like maybe 10 years ago i wouldn't have ever imagined

2:28:00.960 --> 2:28:06.240
 that like one of the top players in the world could be a top player at like 37 or but so and

2:28:06.240 --> 2:28:11.760
 there's an interesting tent the human story is really important but like if you look at ronaldo

2:28:11.760 --> 2:28:18.480
 he's like he's somebody like kids could aspire to be but at the same time i also like maradona who

2:28:18.480 --> 2:28:25.600
 like is a is a tragic figure in many ways is like the you know the drugs the the temper

2:28:26.240 --> 2:28:31.920
 all of those things that's beautiful too like i don't necessarily think to me first the flaws

2:28:31.920 --> 2:28:39.680
 are beautiful too in in athletes i don't think you need to be perfect i agree uh from a personality

2:28:39.680 --> 2:28:47.360
 perspective those flaws are also beautiful so but yeah there is something about hard work and

2:28:47.360 --> 2:28:52.160
 uh there's also something about the being an underdog and being able to carry a team

2:28:53.760 --> 2:28:57.600
 uh that's that's an argument for maradona i don't know if you can make that argument for

2:28:57.600 --> 2:29:03.040
 messi and ronaldo either because they've all played on superstar teams for most of their lives

2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:12.480
 um so i don't know how it you know it's it's difficult to know how they would do um when they

2:29:12.480 --> 2:29:19.200
 had to work like did what maradona had to do to carry a team on his shoulders true and pelle did

2:29:19.200 --> 2:29:24.080
 as well and depending on the the context yeah maybe you could argue that with the portuguese

2:29:24.080 --> 2:29:30.080
 national team but then we have a good team uh yeah but maybe what maradona did with you know

2:29:30.080 --> 2:29:35.200
 lap naples and and a couple other teams it's it's incredible it speaks to the beauty of the game that

2:29:35.200 --> 2:29:39.600
 you know we're talking about all these different players that have or especially you know if you're

2:29:39.600 --> 2:29:45.040
 if you're comparing messi and ronaldo that have such different you know styles of play and also

2:29:45.040 --> 2:29:52.960
 even their bodies are so different and and and but these two very different players can be at the top

2:29:52.960 --> 2:29:58.800
 of the game and that's not that's the there are not a lot of other sports where you where you have

2:29:58.800 --> 2:30:04.880
 that you know like you have kind of a mental image of a basketball player and like the the top

2:30:04.880 --> 2:30:11.280
 basketball players kind of fit that mental image and they look a certain way and um but for soccer

2:30:11.280 --> 2:30:17.520
 there's some there's the it's it's not so much like that and and that's i think that's that's

2:30:17.520 --> 2:30:23.520
 beautiful uh but that really adds something to the sport well do you play soccer yourself

2:30:23.520 --> 2:30:27.840
 have you played that in your your life what do you find beautiful about the game yeah i mean it's one

2:30:27.840 --> 2:30:33.360
 of the i'd say it's the biggest sport in portugal and so growing up we played a lot did you see the

2:30:33.360 --> 2:30:39.920
 paper from deep mind i didn't look at it where they're like uh doing some uh analysis on soccer

2:30:39.920 --> 2:30:46.560
 strategy interesting i i saved that paper uh i haven't read it yet um it's actually i i when i

2:30:46.560 --> 2:30:54.400
 was in college i actually did some research on on applying um machine learning and statistics in

2:30:54.400 --> 2:31:02.640
 sports and in our case in our case we're doing it for basketball um but uh what they're effectively

2:31:02.640 --> 2:31:08.480
 trying to do was have you ever watched moneyball like so they're trying to do something similar

2:31:08.480 --> 2:31:14.480
 right taking that in this case basketball taking a statistical approach to to to basketball um

2:31:15.280 --> 2:31:20.320
 the interesting thing there is that baseball is much more about having these discrete events that

2:31:20.320 --> 2:31:25.520
 happen kind of in similar conditions and so it's easier to take a statistical approach to it whereas

2:31:25.520 --> 2:31:33.200
 basketball it's a much more dynamic game uh it's harder to measure um it's hard to to replicate

2:31:33.200 --> 2:31:39.040
 these conditions and so you you have to think about it in a slightly different way and so we

2:31:39.040 --> 2:31:44.800
 were doing work on that and working like with the celtics to analyze the the data that they had like

2:31:44.800 --> 2:31:49.200
 they had these cameras in the in the arena they were tracking the players and so you so they had

2:31:49.200 --> 2:31:54.000
 a ton of data but they didn't really know what to do with it and so we we were doing work on that

2:31:54.000 --> 2:31:59.360
 and and and soccer is maybe even a step further it's it's right it's a game where you don't have

2:31:59.360 --> 2:32:05.440
 as many in basketball you have a lot of field goals and so you can measure success uh soccer

2:32:05.440 --> 2:32:11.360
 it's it's right it's more of a process almost where it's like you have a goal like or two in

2:32:11.360 --> 2:32:15.520
 in a game in terms of metrics i wonder if there's a way and i've actually have thought about this

2:32:15.520 --> 2:32:20.480
 in the past never coming up with any good solution if there's a way to definitively say whether it's

2:32:20.480 --> 2:32:24.960
 messy or not they're the greatest of all time like like honestly sort of measure interesting

2:32:25.600 --> 2:32:30.400
 like convert the game of soccer into metrics like you said baseball but like those moments

2:32:30.400 --> 2:32:36.960
 of genius like past like um you know if it's just about goals or passes that led to goals

2:32:36.960 --> 2:32:41.440
 yeah that feels like it doesn't capture the genius of the play yeah they'll be like you know like

2:32:43.360 --> 2:32:48.080
 like you kind of do you have more metrics for instance in chess right and you can try to

2:32:48.080 --> 2:32:54.240
 understand how hard of a move that was you know there's like bobby fisher has this move that like

2:32:54.800 --> 2:33:00.800
 that it's i think it's called the move of the century where uh you have to go so deep into the

2:33:00.800 --> 2:33:05.760
 tree to understand that that was the right move and you can quantify how hard it was uh so it'd

2:33:05.760 --> 2:33:09.520
 be interesting to try to think of those type of metrics but say yeah for soccer and computer

2:33:09.520 --> 2:33:14.160
 vision unlocks some of that for us that's that's one possibility i have a cool idea a computer

2:33:14.160 --> 2:33:20.400
 vision product legs that you could build for soccer let's go i'm taking notes if you could

2:33:20.400 --> 2:33:27.360
 detect the ball and like imagine that um it seems like totally doable right now but like if you could

2:33:27.360 --> 2:33:33.680
 detect when the ball enters one of the goals and like just had like um you know a crowd cheering

2:33:33.680 --> 2:33:37.280
 for you when you're playing soccer with your friends every time you score a goal or you had

2:33:37.280 --> 2:33:42.560
 like the the champions league song going on yeah and like having that like you go play soccer with

2:33:42.560 --> 2:33:46.960
 your friends just turn that on and there's like a computer vision like program analyzing the ball

2:33:46.960 --> 2:33:50.880
 detects the ball every time there's a goal like if you miss like there's a you know the fans are

2:33:50.880 --> 2:33:55.520
 reacting to that and then it should be pretty simple by now it's like i think there's an

2:33:55.520 --> 2:34:01.680
 opportunity yeah just throwing that i'm gonna go all out but by the way i did uh i've never

2:34:01.680 --> 2:34:05.840
 released i was thinking of just putting on github but i did write exactly that which is the trackers

2:34:05.840 --> 2:34:10.640
 for the players uh for the for the bodies of the player is this is the hard part actually

2:34:10.640 --> 2:34:18.640
 uh the detection of player bodies and the ball is not hard what's hard is very like robust tracking

2:34:18.640 --> 2:34:25.280
 through time of each of those so like so i wrote a track of this pretty damn good this is this is

2:34:25.280 --> 2:34:29.200
 that is that open source you open so i know i've never released it because interesting because i

2:34:29.200 --> 2:34:36.480
 felt like i need to i would this is the perfection thing because i knew it was going to be like

2:34:36.480 --> 2:34:42.160
 it's gonna pull me in and and it wasn't really that done and so i've never actually been part

2:34:42.160 --> 2:34:47.600
 of a github project where it's like really active development and i didn't want to make it i knew

2:34:47.600 --> 2:34:52.640
 there's a nonzero probability that it will become my life for like a half a year that uh could just

2:34:52.640 --> 2:34:58.000
 how much i love soccer and all those kinds of things and and ultimately it will be all for just

2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:03.920
 the the joy of analyzing the game which i'm all for i remember you also like one of in one of the

2:35:03.920 --> 2:35:08.240
 episodes you mentioned that you did also a lot of high tracking analysis on like joe rogan's that

2:35:08.240 --> 2:35:12.800
 was the that was the research side of my life interesting yeah and you have that library right

2:35:12.800 --> 2:35:18.160
 you you kind of downloaded all the episodes yep allegedly i and of course i didn't if you're a

2:35:18.160 --> 2:35:21.920
 lawyer i'm listening to this no it is yeah i i was listening to the episode where you mentioned

2:35:21.920 --> 2:35:27.120
 that and i was actually there was something that i and i might ask you for for access to that to

2:35:27.120 --> 2:35:33.760
 like allegedly that library uh but i was doing some not not regarding like eye tracking but i was

2:35:33.760 --> 2:35:40.400
 playing around with um analyzing the distribution of silences on uh one of the joe rogan episodes

2:35:40.400 --> 2:35:46.640
 so like i did that for the elon uh conversation where it's like you just take all the silences

2:35:47.200 --> 2:35:52.240
 like after joe asked the question and elon responded and you plot that distribution and

2:35:52.240 --> 2:35:57.760
 like and see how how how that looks like yeah i think there's a huge opportunity especially

2:35:57.760 --> 2:36:04.720
 long form podcasts to do that kind of analysis bigger than joe exactly but it has to be a fairly

2:36:04.720 --> 2:36:10.240
 unedited podcast so that you don't get the silence so one of the benefits i have like doing this

2:36:10.240 --> 2:36:17.040
 podcast is like the what we're recording today is there's individual audio being recorded makes it

2:36:17.040 --> 2:36:22.000
 so like i have the raw information it's when it's published it's all combined together and individual

2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:26.800
 video feeds so even when you're listening which i usually don't i only show one video stream

2:36:27.600 --> 2:36:35.040
 i i'll know i can track your blinks and so on um but yeah but ultimately the hope is you don't

2:36:35.040 --> 2:36:39.200
 need that raw data because if you don't need the raw data for whatever analysis you're doing

2:36:39.520 --> 2:36:44.080
 you can then do a huge number of parts because there's so it's quickly growing now the number

2:36:44.080 --> 2:36:50.000
 especially comedians there's uh quite a few comedians with with long form podcasts and

2:36:51.200 --> 2:36:54.960
 they have a lot of facial expressions they have a lot of fun and all those kinds of things and

2:36:54.960 --> 2:37:01.200
 it's it's prone for analysis and it's there's so many interesting things that that that idea

2:37:01.200 --> 2:37:08.000
 actually sparked because i was watching a um a q a by by steve jobs and i think it was at mit and

2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:13.520
 then like people's like he did a talk there and then the q a started and people starting asking

2:37:13.520 --> 2:37:18.400
 questions that i was i was working while listening to it and like someone asked the question and he

2:37:18.400 --> 2:37:24.080
 goes like on a 20 second silence before answering the question i like i had to check if the if the

2:37:24.080 --> 2:37:30.560
 video hadn't paused or or something and and i was thinking about like like if that is a feature of

2:37:30.560 --> 2:37:36.400
 a person like how long on average you take to respond to a question and if it's like oh that's

2:37:36.400 --> 2:37:41.680
 that has to do with the like how thoughtful you are and if that changes over time oh but it also

2:37:41.680 --> 2:37:46.640
 could be this really fascinating metric because it also could be it's certainly a feature of a

2:37:46.640 --> 2:37:52.000
 person but it's also a function of the question like if you normalize to the person you can

2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:56.880
 probably infer a bunch of stuff about the question so it's a nice flag like it's a really strong

2:37:56.880 --> 2:38:03.120
 signal the length of that silence but relative to the usual silence they have so one the silence is

2:38:03.120 --> 2:38:08.640
 a measure of how thoughtful they are and two the particular silence is a measure how thoughtful

2:38:08.640 --> 2:38:13.040
 the question was thoughtful the question was it's really interesting i mean yeah yeah i just

2:38:13.040 --> 2:38:19.760
 analyzed elon's uh episode but i think there's like room for exploration there i feel like the

2:38:19.760 --> 2:38:24.160
 average they could do for comedians would be like i mean the time would be so small because you're

2:38:24.160 --> 2:38:28.240
 trained to like i would i would think you're reacting to hecklers you're reacting to all

2:38:28.240 --> 2:38:33.680
 sorts of things you have to be like so quick maybe right yeah but some of the greatest comedians are

2:38:33.680 --> 2:38:40.240
 very good at sitting in the silence i mean there there's louis ck they play with that because you

2:38:40.240 --> 2:38:49.520
 have a rhythm and like um dave chappelle a comedian who did a joe show recently he has uh

2:38:50.160 --> 2:38:55.840
 especially when he's just having a conversation he does long pauses it's kind of cool because it

2:38:55.840 --> 2:39:03.120
 uh it it's one of the ways to have people hang in your word is to play with the pauses to play

2:39:03.120 --> 2:39:09.120
 with the silences and the emphasis and like mid sentence there's a bunch of different things that

2:39:09.120 --> 2:39:15.120
 uh it'd be interesting to really really analyze but still soccer to me is uh that that one's

2:39:15.120 --> 2:39:20.880
 fascinating just i just want a conclusive definitive statement about because like there's so

2:39:20.880 --> 2:39:28.960
 many soccer highlights of both messi and ronaldo i just feel like the raw data is there

2:39:29.840 --> 2:39:38.000
 um because you don't have that with pelÃ© and mardona just yeah true but here's a huge amount

2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:43.040
 of high dev data then the the annoying the difficult thing and this is really hard for

2:39:43.040 --> 2:39:48.480
 tracking and this is actually where i kind of gave up because i didn't really give much effort

2:39:48.480 --> 2:39:56.640
 but i gave up to the the way that highlights or usually football match filmed is they switch

2:39:56.640 --> 2:40:02.320
 to camera so they'll they'll do a different switch perspective so you have to it's a really

2:40:02.320 --> 2:40:06.000
 interesting computer vision problem when the perspective is switched you still have a lot of

2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:10.720
 overlap about the players but the perspective is sufficiently different that you have to like

2:40:10.720 --> 2:40:21.360
 recompute everything so i there there's two ways to solve this so one is doing it the full way where

2:40:21.360 --> 2:40:25.840
 you're constantly doing the slam problem you you're doing a 3d reconstruction the whole time

2:40:25.840 --> 2:40:32.320
 and projecting into that 3d world but you could also there could be some hacks that i wonder like

2:40:32.320 --> 2:40:39.440
 some trick where you can hop like when the perspective shifts do a high probability

2:40:39.440 --> 2:40:47.040
 from one object to another but i i thought especially in exciting moments when when when

2:40:47.040 --> 2:40:53.280
 you're passing players like you're doing a single ball dribble across players and you switch

2:40:53.280 --> 2:40:57.040
 perspective which is when they often do when you're making a run on goal if you switch your

2:40:57.040 --> 2:41:02.480
 perspective it's it feels like that's going to be really tricky to get right uh that's

2:41:02.480 --> 2:41:06.640
 automatically but in that case for instance i feel like if somebody released that data set

2:41:06.640 --> 2:41:12.880
 or it's like you just have all like these this data set a massive data set of all these games

2:41:12.880 --> 2:41:19.040
 from from say ronaldo and messy like and just you just add that in like whatever csv format and some

2:41:19.040 --> 2:41:24.400
 some publicly available data set like that i feel like people would just there there would be so

2:41:24.400 --> 2:41:28.720
 many cool things that you could do with it and you just set it free and then like the world would

2:41:28.720 --> 2:41:34.080
 like do its thing and then like interesting things would come out of it by the way i have this data

2:41:34.080 --> 2:41:40.720
 set so the two the two things i've did of this scale uh is soccer so his body pose and ball

2:41:40.720 --> 2:41:48.560
 tracking for soccer and then um i try it's pupil tracking and blink tracking for it was joe rogan

2:41:48.560 --> 2:41:53.600
 and a few other podcasts that i did so those are the two data sets i have did you analyze any of

2:41:53.600 --> 2:42:03.120
 your podcasts no i i think i really started doing this podcast after after doing that work and it's

2:42:03.120 --> 2:42:12.800
 difficult to maybe i'd be afraid of what i find i'm already annoyed with my own voice and video

2:42:12.800 --> 2:42:18.640
 like editing it uh but perhaps that's the honest thing to do because uh one useful thing i about

2:42:18.640 --> 2:42:24.320
 doing computer vision about myself is like i know what i was thinking at the time so you can start

2:42:24.320 --> 2:42:32.000
 to like connect the particular the behavioral peculiarities of like the way you blink the way

2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:39.760
 you squint the way you close your eyes like talking about details there's it's like for example i just

2:42:39.760 --> 2:42:46.560
 closed my eyes is that a blink or no like figuring that out in terms of timing in terms of the link

2:42:46.560 --> 2:42:53.920
 dynamics it's tricky it's very doable i i think there's universal laws about what is a blink and

2:42:53.920 --> 2:43:00.560
 what is a closed eye and all those things plus makeup and eyelashes i actually um have annoyingly

2:43:00.560 --> 2:43:06.080
 long eyelashes so i remember when i was doing a lot of this work i i would cut off my eyelashes

2:43:06.080 --> 2:43:11.280
 which when like especially it was funny like female colleagues were like what the fuck are

2:43:11.280 --> 2:43:16.160
 you doing like those no keep the eyelashes but because it got in the way made the computer

2:43:16.160 --> 2:43:23.680
 vision a lot more difficult but super interesting topics yeah but speaking about the one uh still

2:43:23.680 --> 2:43:28.960
 on the topic of the data sets for sports there's one um one paper that and i actually annotated

2:43:28.960 --> 2:43:37.280
 on format and and uh it's it was published in 90s 90s i believe 90s or 80s i forget but it would

2:43:37.280 --> 2:43:45.520
 they you the researcher was effectively looking at the hot end phenomena in basketball right so

2:43:45.520 --> 2:43:52.400
 whether like the fact that you just made a field goal um if you know if on your next attempt if

2:43:52.400 --> 2:43:59.120
 you're more likely to make it or not um and it was super interesting because they i mean he polled

2:43:59.120 --> 2:44:04.480
 like i think 100 undergrads and i think from stanford and cornell and asking people like do

2:44:04.480 --> 2:44:09.680
 you you think that's that you have a higher likelihood of making your free throw if you just

2:44:09.680 --> 2:44:16.880
 just made one and i think it's like 68 68 percent said yes they believe that and then he looked

2:44:16.880 --> 2:44:22.640
 at the data and this was back in as i said like a few decades ago and so i think he had the data

2:44:22.640 --> 2:44:28.800
 set of about uh he looked at it specifically for free throws and he had a data set of about 5,000

2:44:28.800 --> 2:44:36.640
 free throws and um and effectively what he found was that specifically in the case of free throws

2:44:37.280 --> 2:44:44.160
 he didn't for the aggregate data he didn't find um that he couldn't really spot that correlation

2:44:44.160 --> 2:44:50.320
 that hot end correlation so if you made the first one you weren't more likely to to make the second

2:44:50.320 --> 2:44:55.040
 one what he did find was that they were just better at the second one because you just got

2:44:55.040 --> 2:45:00.080
 like maybe a tiny practice and you just attempted once and then and then you're going to be better

2:45:00.080 --> 2:45:06.400
 at the next one and then i i then i went and there's a data set on kaggle that has like 600,000

2:45:06.400 --> 2:45:13.120
 free throws and i reran the the same computations and and and confirmed like you can see a very

2:45:13.120 --> 2:45:18.880
 clear pattern that they're just better at their second free throw um that's interesting because

2:45:18.880 --> 2:45:23.840
 i think there's similarly that kind of analysis is so awesome because i think with tennis they

2:45:23.840 --> 2:45:29.120
 have like uh like a fault like when you serve they have analysis of like are you most likely

2:45:29.120 --> 2:45:34.640
 to miss the second serve if you missed the first obviously um yeah i think that's the case so that

2:45:34.640 --> 2:45:40.960
 integrates that's so cool when psychology is converted into metrics in that way and in sports

2:45:40.960 --> 2:45:46.640
 sports it's especially cool because it's such a constrained system that you can really study

2:45:46.640 --> 2:45:51.760
 human psychology because it's repeated it's constrained so many things are controlled which

2:45:51.760 --> 2:45:59.040
 is something you rarely have in in the wild psychological experiments so it's cool uh plus

2:45:59.040 --> 2:46:04.000
 everyone loves it like sports is really cool to analyze people actually care about the results

2:46:04.000 --> 2:46:11.520
 yeah um i still think well like i uh i and i will definitely publish uh this work on messy

2:46:11.520 --> 2:46:15.840
 versus ronaldo and i'd love to read it objective fully objective to peer review

2:46:18.400 --> 2:46:21.840
 um yeah this is very true this is not past period

2:46:22.800 --> 2:46:30.400
 um let me ask sort of um an advice question to uh to young folks you've explored a lot of

2:46:30.400 --> 2:46:36.640
 fascinating ideas in your life you built a startup worked on physics worked on computer science

2:46:37.360 --> 2:46:43.440
 what advice would you give to young people today in high school maybe early college about life

2:46:43.440 --> 2:46:52.320
 about career about science and mathematics i remember like uh i read like i remember reading

2:46:52.320 --> 2:47:00.560
 that um punk area was once asked by a um a french journal about his advice for young people and what

2:47:00.560 --> 2:47:05.600
 was his teaching philosophy and he said that like one of the most important things that parents

2:47:05.600 --> 2:47:11.920
 should teach their kids is how to be enthusiastic um in regards to like the mysteries of the world

2:47:12.560 --> 2:47:17.040
 and that he said like striking that balance was actually one of the most important things between

2:47:17.040 --> 2:47:21.680
 like in education you know you want to have your kids be enthusiastic about the mysteries of the

2:47:21.680 --> 2:47:25.520
 world but you also don't want to traumatize them like if you really force them into something

2:47:25.520 --> 2:47:33.520
 and i think like especially if you're young i think you should be curious and i think you should

2:47:35.360 --> 2:47:41.360
 explore that curiosity to the fullest to the point where you even become almost as an expert

2:47:41.360 --> 2:47:47.120
 on that topic and now and you might start with something that it's small like you might start

2:47:47.120 --> 2:47:51.920
 with you know you're interested in numbers and how to factor numbers into primes and then all of a

2:47:51.920 --> 2:47:57.760
 sudden you go and and you're like lost in number theory and you discover cryptography and then all

2:47:57.760 --> 2:48:03.680
 of a sudden you're buying bitcoin and i and i think you should do this um you should really try

2:48:03.680 --> 2:48:08.720
 to fulfill this curiosity and you should live in a society that allows you to fulfill this curiosity

2:48:08.720 --> 2:48:14.400
 which is also important and i think you should do this not to get to some sort of status or fame or

2:48:14.400 --> 2:48:20.160
 money but i think this is the way this iterative process i think this is the way to find happiness

2:48:20.800 --> 2:48:26.960
 and and i think this is also allows you to find the meaning for your life i think it's all about

2:48:26.960 --> 2:48:33.360
 like being curious and being able to fulfill that curiosity and that path to fulfilling that your

2:48:33.360 --> 2:48:39.120
 curiosity yeah the the start small let the fire build this kind of interesting way to think about

2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:44.960
 it and you never know where you're going to end up it's it's like for us is just a really good

2:48:44.960 --> 2:48:50.720
 example we started like by doing this as an internal like thing that we did in the company

2:48:50.720 --> 2:48:55.600
 and then we started putting out there and now a lot of people follow it and know about it and so

2:48:56.160 --> 2:49:01.760
 and you still don't know where from our library is going to end up actually true exactly so um

2:49:01.760 --> 2:49:07.760
 yeah i think that would be my piece of advice with very limited experience of course but yeah yeah i

2:49:07.760 --> 2:49:14.640
 agree i agree uh i mean is there something in from particular joao from the computer science

2:49:14.640 --> 2:49:20.560
 versus physics perspective uh do do you regret not doing physics do you regret not doing computer

2:49:20.560 --> 2:49:26.240
 science which one is the the wiser the better human being this is messy versus ronaldo um

2:49:27.120 --> 2:49:33.600
 those are very i i don't know if you would agree but they're kind of different disciplines true

2:49:33.600 --> 2:49:42.080
 yeah very much so um i actually i actually uh i was i had that question in my mind i i took

2:49:42.080 --> 2:49:50.080
 physics classes as an undergrad or like besides what i had to take and um it's definitely something

2:49:50.080 --> 2:50:01.200
 that i considered at some point um and and that i i i do feel like later in life that might be

2:50:01.200 --> 2:50:07.200
 something that i'm not sure if regret is is the right word but it's it's kind of something that

2:50:07.200 --> 2:50:12.880
 i can imagine in an alternative universe what would have happened if i if i got into physics

2:50:13.440 --> 2:50:21.760
 um i try to think that like well depends on what your path ends up being but that it's it's not

2:50:22.560 --> 2:50:29.120
 super important right like exactly what you decide to major on like i think there's there's um

2:50:29.120 --> 2:50:34.640
 um i think tim urban like the blogger had a good visualization of this where it's like

2:50:34.640 --> 2:50:39.520
 you know like he he he has a picture where you have all sorts of paths that you could pursue in

2:50:39.520 --> 2:50:43.680
 your life and then maybe you're in the middle of it and so there's maybe some paths that are not

2:50:43.680 --> 2:50:48.560
 accessible to you but like the the tree that is still in front of you gives you a lot of optionality

2:50:48.560 --> 2:50:53.440
 and so um there's two lessons to learn from that like we have a huge number of options now

2:50:53.440 --> 2:51:02.320
 and probably you're just one to reflect like to try to uh derive wisdom from the one little path

2:51:02.320 --> 2:51:07.360
 you've taken so far may be flawed because there's all these other paths you could have taken yeah so

2:51:07.360 --> 2:51:13.520
 it's like uh so one it's inspiring that you can take any path now and two it's like you you the

2:51:13.520 --> 2:51:20.240
 path you've taken so far is just one of many possible ones but it does seem that like physics

2:51:20.240 --> 2:51:26.000
 and computer science both open a lot of doors and a lot of different doors it's very interesting it

2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:31.600
 is i i like in this case like and especially in in our case because i could see the difference i

2:51:31.600 --> 2:51:37.440
 studied i i went to college in europe and joel went to college here in the u.s so i could see

2:51:37.440 --> 2:51:43.200
 the difference and like in the european system is um more rigid in the sense that when you decide

2:51:43.200 --> 2:51:47.600
 to study physics you don't have a lot especially in the early years you don't have a lot of um

2:51:47.600 --> 2:51:52.000
 you can't choose to take like a class from like computer science course or something like that

2:51:52.000 --> 2:51:56.000
 don't have a lot of freedom to explore in that sense in university as opposed to here in the

2:51:56.000 --> 2:52:02.000
 u.s where you have more freedom and i think um i think that's important i think that's what

2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:07.760
 constitutes you know a good kind of educational system is one that gravitates towards the interests

2:52:07.760 --> 2:52:13.200
 of a student as as you progress but i think in order for you to do that you need to explore

2:52:13.200 --> 2:52:18.320
 different areas and i i felt like if i had a chance to take say more computer science class

2:52:18.320 --> 2:52:23.440
 when i was in college i would have probably have taken those classes but um yeah but i ended up

2:52:23.440 --> 2:52:28.880
 like focusing maybe too like too much in physics and uh i think here at least my perception is

2:52:28.880 --> 2:52:36.560
 that you can explore more more fields but there is a kind of it's funny but physics can be difficult

2:52:36.560 --> 2:52:42.000
 so i don't see too many computer science people than exploring into physics it's only like the one

2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:51.200
 the not the one but one of the beneficial things of physics it feels like it uh what was it rutherford

2:52:51.200 --> 2:52:58.000
 that said like like basically that physics is the hard thing and everything is easy uh so like

2:52:58.000 --> 2:53:02.880
 there's a certain sense once you've figured out some basic like physics that it's not that you

2:53:02.880 --> 2:53:08.400
 need the tools of physics to understand the other disciplines it's that you're empowered by having

2:53:08.400 --> 2:53:15.120
 done difficult shit i mean the ultimate i think is probably mathematics there yeah true uh so maybe

2:53:15.120 --> 2:53:20.000
 just doing difficult things and proving to yourself that you can do difficult things whatever those

2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:25.600
