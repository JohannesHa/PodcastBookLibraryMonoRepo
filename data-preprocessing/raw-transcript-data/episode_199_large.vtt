00:00.260 --> 00:03.140
 The following is a conversation with Roger Reeves,

00:03.140 --> 00:06.340
 one of the most prolific drug smugglers in history.

00:06.340 --> 00:10.420
 He worked for Pablo Escobar and Jorge Ochoa,

00:10.420 --> 00:13.460
 the leaders behind the Medellin Cartel.

00:13.460 --> 00:17.420
 Roger was the employer and close friend of Barry Seal,

00:17.420 --> 00:20.060
 the infamous drug smuggler who was the main character

00:20.060 --> 00:22.060
 in the movie American Maid.

00:22.060 --> 00:26.320
 Roger transported countless tons of cocaine and marijuana

00:26.320 --> 00:27.980
 covering six continents.

00:27.980 --> 00:30.200
 He escaped prison five times,

00:30.200 --> 00:32.400
 was shut down in both Mexico and Colombia,

00:32.400 --> 00:36.920
 and was tortured nearly to death in a Mexican prison.

00:36.920 --> 00:40.920
 Through all of this, his wife Mari, the love of his life,

00:40.920 --> 00:43.600
 was there with him, and when he was in prison,

00:43.600 --> 00:45.200
 she waited for him.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.820
 He recently got out of prison where for many years

00:47.820 --> 00:50.680
 he worked on his memoir called Smuggler.

00:50.680 --> 00:54.180
 This podcast is an exploration of his story.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.200
 Quick mention of our sponsors.

00:56.200 --> 01:01.200
 Noom, Allform, ExpressVPN, Four Sigmatic, and Aidsleep.

01:01.920 --> 01:04.880
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

01:04.880 --> 01:06.920
 Let me say a few words about Roger Reeves,

01:06.920 --> 01:09.920
 Pablo Escobar, and the war on drugs.

01:09.920 --> 01:13.320
 This conversation with Roger is unlike any I've ever done.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.840
 In the eyes of many, including the law,

01:15.840 --> 01:18.720
 Roger is a criminal, a bad man who was added

01:18.720 --> 01:20.560
 to the suffering in the world.

01:20.560 --> 01:23.160
 But he never directly engaged or participated

01:23.160 --> 01:24.420
 in the violence.

01:24.420 --> 01:28.340
 Unlike his bosses, Pablo Escobar and Jorge Ochoa.

01:29.280 --> 01:32.080
 His crime was the transport of drugs.

01:32.080 --> 01:35.280
 I thought about this, and about Pablo Escobar,

01:35.280 --> 01:38.080
 who was at once both a brutal murderer

01:38.080 --> 01:40.680
 and a Robin Hood figure who helped the poor

01:40.680 --> 01:44.200
 and was loved by thousands, if not millions.

01:44.200 --> 01:48.240
 We sometimes idolize murderers and destroy good, honest men.

01:48.240 --> 01:50.600
 We give power and money to corrupt politicians

01:50.600 --> 01:53.960
 and dictators that starve and murder their own people.

01:53.960 --> 01:57.400
 Given this, I think about what makes for a good man,

01:57.400 --> 02:01.440
 and what makes for a bad man, and who decides.

02:01.440 --> 02:04.720
 Sitting across from Roger, I saw a complicated man,

02:04.720 --> 02:06.960
 but one who has kindness in his heart,

02:06.960 --> 02:11.960
 a love for money and adventure, and a disdain for violence.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.680
 Again, his crime was the transport of drugs.

02:14.680 --> 02:19.680
 Since 1971, the war on drugs has cost U.S. $1 trillion.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.560
 Marijuana legalization alone would save

02:22.560 --> 02:26.680
 and make $13.7 billion, that could send

02:26.680 --> 02:28.760
 more than 650,000 students

02:28.760 --> 02:31.280
 to public universities every year.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.880
 Then there's the human stories of the 500,000 human beings

02:34.880 --> 02:37.440
 sitting in prison for drug related offenses,

02:37.440 --> 02:40.800
 and the 1.1 million on probation and parole.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.100
 Their life is damaged or ruined beyond repair

02:44.100 --> 02:46.400
 due to the prohibition of drugs.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.840
 There's a lot more to be said about the damage done

02:48.840 --> 02:52.360
 by the war on drugs, but when reading about Roger's story

02:52.360 --> 02:55.280
 and talking to him, I couldn't escape the thought

02:55.280 --> 02:57.960
 that while society wants to label him a criminal

02:57.960 --> 03:01.520
 and a bad human being, there are much worse men out there

03:01.520 --> 03:04.740
 who we give a pass to, even give power to,

03:04.740 --> 03:09.120
 even men who hold political office or run companies.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.940
 I also think about my role as an interviewer,

03:11.940 --> 03:14.080
 sitting across a man like Roger.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.640
 In these interviews, in life,

03:16.640 --> 03:19.020
 in many ways I continue to be myself,

03:19.020 --> 03:21.940
 a person who like Dostoyevsky's The Idiot,

03:21.940 --> 03:24.160
 seeks the good in all people,

03:24.160 --> 03:26.180
 but is hurt by it on occasion,

03:26.180 --> 03:29.740
 and maybe is destroyed by it in the end.

03:29.740 --> 03:32.380
 I'm not naive, but I'm also optimistic

03:32.380 --> 03:34.420
 and have hope for humanity.

03:34.420 --> 03:37.720
 That's who I am, and that's what these conversations are.

03:37.720 --> 03:40.640
 I hope you join me, and I hope you understand

03:40.640 --> 03:43.160
 that I come from a place of love.

03:43.160 --> 03:45.200
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,

03:45.200 --> 03:48.240
 and here's my conversation with Roger Reeves.

03:48.240 --> 03:53.140
 You are one of the most prolific drug smugglers in history.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.840
 What would you say motivated you?

03:55.840 --> 03:59.420
 Money, power, the thrill, or was it something else?

03:59.420 --> 04:00.440
 Money.

04:00.440 --> 04:04.200
 But isn't there a point where you've had more money

04:04.200 --> 04:06.360
 than you can possibly know what to do with,

04:06.360 --> 04:07.840
 or is it always more money?

04:09.000 --> 04:13.080
 You know, I had plenty of money several times,

04:13.080 --> 04:17.160
 and I think it's sort of like if you was in Las Vegas

04:17.160 --> 04:20.480
 and you had the slot machine handled down,

04:20.480 --> 04:22.560
 and the gold coins was tumbling around you,

04:22.560 --> 04:25.360
 and you had sweepers bagging them up,

04:25.360 --> 04:27.280
 when would you let it go?

04:27.280 --> 04:29.960
 But isn't some part of that the thrill then?

04:29.960 --> 04:33.120
 Oh, there was a lot of thrill, sometimes way too much.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.960
 You made certainly tens of millions of dollars,

04:35.960 --> 04:37.040
 probably much more.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.920
 What memorable experience

04:38.920 --> 04:41.720
 did having that much money make possible for you?

04:41.720 --> 04:44.120
 So there's one thing is the money,

04:44.120 --> 04:47.320
 and the other thing is what that money can buy.

04:47.320 --> 04:50.280
 Well, I bought everything that I could hide.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.200
 I bought seven farms.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.760
 I owned the city,

04:55.760 --> 04:59.320
 the land where the city of Moreno Valley, California is.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.040
 I had an option on that land.

05:01.040 --> 05:03.300
 Did the planning and development of that.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.360
 The most expensive coin in the world.

05:09.120 --> 05:12.360
 Yachts, ships, airplanes galore.

05:12.360 --> 05:13.760
 Did that bring you happiness?

05:13.760 --> 05:16.880
 No, absolutely not.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.280
 In fact, I think I'm happier now.

05:18.280 --> 05:19.800
 I know I'm happier now.

05:19.800 --> 05:24.640
 So looking back, would you do it the same way all again?

05:24.640 --> 05:25.680
 No way.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.360
 Really, even the thrill of it?

05:28.360 --> 05:29.680
 Not even thrill of it.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.880
 It wasn't worth 33 years in prison,

05:31.880 --> 05:33.620
 being away from my lovely family.

05:34.900 --> 05:37.980
 So money, what about the power?

05:37.980 --> 05:41.000
 Just being on top of the world where nobody can,

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
 not the governments, the police,

05:46.320 --> 05:50.320
 all the big, bad agencies chasing you,

05:50.320 --> 05:52.740
 and you could do whatever the heck you wanted.

05:52.740 --> 05:54.860
 As far as having to look over your shoulder

05:54.860 --> 05:58.060
 everywhere you went and every phone call you made,

05:58.060 --> 06:00.560
 make sure that you was naked with somebody in the ocean

06:00.560 --> 06:01.520
 before you talked.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.040
 It's rather uncomfortable.

06:05.040 --> 06:05.880
 Yeah.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.840
 I like to make phone calls the same way.

06:09.840 --> 06:14.840
 What was it like meeting and working with Pablo Escobar,

06:15.640 --> 06:17.420
 the leader of the Medellin Cartel?

06:18.320 --> 06:21.320
 He was just, just seemed like a gentleman when I met him.

06:21.320 --> 06:23.280
 He was just like you and I, sitting here, shook hands,

06:23.280 --> 06:26.600
 and I had flown one load for a fellow,

06:26.600 --> 06:28.920
 and it didn't work out well.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.600
 The fellow that I gave it to got shot,

06:30.600 --> 06:31.920
 and it took a while to get my money,

06:31.920 --> 06:34.000
 and they didn't put as many kilos on the plane

06:34.000 --> 06:34.840
 as they're supposed to,

06:34.840 --> 06:37.200
 and so I wasn't gonna work with him anymore,

06:37.200 --> 06:39.160
 and my contact down there introduced me

06:39.160 --> 06:43.440
 to Jorge Ochoa, and we went up,

06:43.440 --> 06:45.680
 and in Vigado, we went up and the gate opened,

06:45.680 --> 06:47.200
 and we was escorted in.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.840
 There must have been 50 men out in the yards,

06:49.840 --> 06:52.480
 hitching a rail on an old house,

06:52.480 --> 06:54.720
 and we was escorted right in,

06:54.720 --> 06:57.040
 and there was a beautiful woman in there.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.760
 I mean, gore, drop dead beautiful,

06:59.760 --> 07:02.440
 and she made us a cup of coffee,

07:02.440 --> 07:06.040
 then ushered in to see Jorge Ochoa,

07:06.040 --> 07:08.160
 and he had 12 telephones on his desk,

07:08.160 --> 07:09.880
 and all of them was a different color,

07:09.880 --> 07:12.480
 and he shook hands, was very friendly, spoke English,

07:13.720 --> 07:15.840
 and he said that each one of those telephones

07:15.840 --> 07:18.280
 represented another city in the United States.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.360
 This is Chicago, and this is New York.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.720
 If I ring, I knew who was calling,

07:22.720 --> 07:24.440
 and so we chatted a while,

07:24.440 --> 07:26.840
 and he asked me what type of airplanes I had

07:28.040 --> 07:31.480
 and what experience I had flying across the U.S. border,

07:31.480 --> 07:35.080
 and I told him he seemed pleased with it,

07:35.080 --> 07:37.680
 and he called the lady in, and she went next door,

07:37.680 --> 07:39.520
 and in came Pablo Escobar,

07:39.520 --> 07:41.320
 and he introduced me to Pablo Escobar,

07:41.320 --> 07:43.560
 and he asked the same questions again,

07:43.560 --> 07:48.560
 and I answered him, and I asked him how much he paid,

07:49.600 --> 07:53.000
 and he paid $5,000 a kilo to haul it,

07:53.000 --> 07:55.520
 and so I said, how much you put on the plane?

07:55.520 --> 07:59.240
 He said 300, 500, so that's one and a half,

07:59.240 --> 08:01.520
 two and a half million dollars for an eight hour trip.

08:01.520 --> 08:02.840
 Sounded pretty good to me.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.720
 And we're talking about cocaine.

08:04.720 --> 08:05.560
 Cocaine. And we're talking

08:05.560 --> 08:06.520
 about Colombia.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.160
 Colombia, and cocaine, and Medellin cartel.

08:09.160 --> 08:12.560
 And Jorge Ochoa was one of the, what would you say,

08:12.560 --> 08:14.200
 founding members of the Medellin?

08:14.200 --> 08:16.160
 He was probably the brains behind the whole thing.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.760
 The brains, and spoke good English.

08:17.760 --> 08:18.600
 Yes.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.880
 And they were nice people.

08:19.880 --> 08:21.440
 Really nice people.

08:21.440 --> 08:22.560
 Were you scared?

08:22.560 --> 08:23.640
 Not at all.

08:23.640 --> 08:26.400
 What's wrong with your mind that you weren't scared?

08:26.400 --> 08:30.000
 Here's some of the most dangerous men in this world,

08:30.000 --> 08:31.120
 and you weren't scared.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.000
 Well, I knew I was gonna do exactly what I said

08:33.000 --> 08:34.080
 I was gonna do.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.400
 Murray and the children were down there.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.080
 They went down and they stayed in the hotel,

08:37.080 --> 08:40.240
 five stars, treated royally on my first load.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.640
 And they just did ask security to make sure

08:42.640 --> 08:44.680
 that I wasn't a DEA agent.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.440
 So I did the first load,

08:47.440 --> 08:49.960
 and they can say they were hostages,

08:49.960 --> 08:51.120
 but they really weren't.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.000
 It was just insurance.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.240
 So there was some integrity to the way they operated.

08:56.240 --> 08:57.400
 Completely.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.160
 I mean, straight up.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.360
 The money was ironed and banded,

09:02.360 --> 09:04.960
 banded and just right.

09:04.960 --> 09:09.280
 And the numbers were never once anything wrong with it.

09:09.280 --> 09:11.600
 What would you attribute that honesty to?

09:11.600 --> 09:16.600
 Within their own moral system and their own set of rules,

09:17.600 --> 09:20.040
 why weren't people crossing the line

09:20.040 --> 09:24.440
 and shaving off the top and injecting chaos

09:24.440 --> 09:28.080
 into the system to where it would be unpredictable

09:28.080 --> 09:30.160
 and people would be dishonest and greedy

09:30.160 --> 09:31.800
 and all those kinds of things?

09:31.800 --> 09:32.640
 That's true.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.200
 Most people are, but there's certain people

09:34.200 --> 09:37.560
 at the top of the food chain that they don't need that.

09:37.560 --> 09:40.520
 And if they're completely honest,

09:40.520 --> 09:41.840
 then they don't have to think of,

09:41.840 --> 09:43.960
 remember the lie they told.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.880
 And plus they're just honest to start with.

09:45.880 --> 09:48.320
 They're making plenty of money.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.280
 They was making as much money as I did.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.920
 I'll tell you how that came about.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.920
 I understand that 10,000 people were killed every year

09:57.920 --> 10:00.600
 in Medellin, Colombia, and what they were doing,

10:00.600 --> 10:03.760
 they didn't have any organization.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.480
 And if one fellow had 10 kilos

10:06.480 --> 10:08.840
 and he wanted it shipped to New York,

10:08.840 --> 10:10.800
 he would tell his friend and his friend says,

10:10.800 --> 10:11.640
 sure, I'll ship it.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.160
 I have a pilot and I'll ship it up.

10:13.160 --> 10:14.840
 And then he would look in the newspapers,

10:14.840 --> 10:17.200
 oh, 40 kilos was busted in New Jersey.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.520
 I'm so sorry, yours got busted.

10:19.520 --> 10:20.800
 Bang, bang, he's dead.

10:22.600 --> 10:26.960
 So here comes Jorge Ochoa and the three Ochoa brothers

10:26.960 --> 10:28.640
 and Pablo Escobar and Gacho.

10:28.640 --> 10:32.440
 And they decided that we will make an insurance company,

10:33.400 --> 10:35.560
 that we will charge you $10,000

10:35.560 --> 10:38.360
 to take it to your contact in Miami.

10:39.960 --> 10:43.000
 If it gets lost anywhere between the time I put it

10:43.000 --> 10:45.320
 on the airplane or the time you give it to us

10:45.320 --> 10:47.280
 and the time we give it to your man,

10:47.280 --> 10:50.400
 we will replace it in Colombia for you.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.680
 So there was no way anybody could lose.

10:52.680 --> 10:55.200
 And I understand they got a hundred tons piled up

10:56.240 --> 10:57.920
 under that insurance program.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.720
 And I was right there the first day.

11:00.720 --> 11:03.360
 So I had all the work I could do.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.800
 I would land and I said, when do you want me to come back?

11:05.800 --> 11:07.320
 We're waiting on you, Senor.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.400
 Well, let me ask a difficult question.

11:10.400 --> 11:14.080
 Some see Escobar as a brutal murderer

11:14.080 --> 11:17.800
 and some see him as maybe a Robin Hood like figure

11:17.800 --> 11:19.560
 who helped the poor.

11:19.560 --> 11:20.840
 How do you see the man?

11:20.840 --> 11:22.360
 Both of them.

11:22.360 --> 11:25.160
 I think he started out to be honest with help the poor.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.040
 And then they had a war down there

11:27.040 --> 11:29.320
 and they blew up and killed his people.

11:29.320 --> 11:32.920
 And the country was divided almost equally three ways.

11:32.920 --> 11:36.040
 They had the military.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.200
 They were just as much into it as anybody.

11:38.200 --> 11:40.520
 And then you had the FARC guerrillas.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.720
 They had about a third of the country.

11:42.720 --> 11:43.960
 And then you had the Contras.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.120
 It was like the white farmers

11:46.120 --> 11:48.400
 and they're the ones that I was dealing with

11:48.400 --> 11:50.840
 and they were at war with one another.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.680
 And so if one of them started killing their people,

11:53.680 --> 11:55.760
 well, I'll kill some of yours too.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.240
 So that's how it happened.

11:57.240 --> 11:59.960
 And then when I heard about Pablo Escobar

11:59.960 --> 12:01.080
 blowing up that airliner

12:01.080 --> 12:02.840
 and killing those women and children,

12:02.840 --> 12:05.040
 I was sorry I ever shook his hand.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.080
 That's brutal murder.

12:07.080 --> 12:10.640
 So you would say Escobar is not a good man?

12:10.640 --> 12:11.560
 Not at all.

12:11.560 --> 12:13.240
 He's terrible.

12:13.240 --> 12:16.840
 Now, looking back on it, when I met him, he was good.

12:16.840 --> 12:19.520
 Did just exactly what he said he would do.

12:19.520 --> 12:22.800
 Could he be a bad man and a man you can trust?

12:22.800 --> 12:23.640
 Are those the things you...

12:23.640 --> 12:25.840
 Absolutely you could trust him, yes.

12:27.560 --> 12:31.440
 So from your perspective, in terms of business,

12:31.440 --> 12:35.600
 he was reliable, he was honest, had integrity.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.280
 You could work with him and he felt safe.

12:38.280 --> 12:39.720
 Completely.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.640
 We flew up to his ranch

12:41.640 --> 12:45.440
 and we brought out motorcycles to start with.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.560
 And can you ride a motorcycle?

12:46.560 --> 12:48.160
 Of course I can ride a motorcycle.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.080
 So I took off across the grass

12:50.080 --> 12:51.840
 and there was a little ditch there

12:51.840 --> 12:53.720
 and the front wheel dropped in that thing

12:53.720 --> 12:56.560
 and I must have slid across that grass 20 feet

12:56.560 --> 12:57.560
 before I got stopped.

12:57.560 --> 13:00.240
 He almost fell off of his bike waiting

13:00.240 --> 13:01.920
 because they knew what it was gonna do.

13:01.920 --> 13:04.120
 And then we got on horses and we went out there

13:04.120 --> 13:06.720
 and pretended to round up some cows

13:06.720 --> 13:09.800
 and he put a Mac 10 machine gun pistol over my shoulder.

13:09.800 --> 13:10.920
 Do you know how to use this?

13:10.920 --> 13:13.080
 Well, I never had, but it was all right.

13:13.080 --> 13:16.160
 I think it was like, okay, you got 10 bodyguards,

13:16.160 --> 13:17.840
 what do you need me for?

13:17.840 --> 13:19.880
 So that's the kind of time we laughed and talked

13:19.880 --> 13:23.000
 and drove some cows over the stumps.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.960
 You said Jorge Ochoa was perhaps the brains

13:26.960 --> 13:28.480
 of the Medellin cartel.

13:30.320 --> 13:31.640
 What was he like?

13:31.640 --> 13:35.160
 And why do you say he was the brains?

13:35.160 --> 13:36.400
 Well, he was a gentleman.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.400
 And I suppose he shipped,

13:39.400 --> 13:41.880
 and don't tell me how many more times of cocaine

13:41.880 --> 13:43.320
 than Pablo did.

13:43.320 --> 13:44.720
 Just him and his brothers,

13:44.720 --> 13:47.880
 you could tell by the, they had on each load,

13:47.880 --> 13:51.120
 they was in duffel bags and his big football shaped

13:52.520 --> 13:55.240
 fluffy stuff made with ether.

13:55.240 --> 13:58.600
 And they would have three horns on it

13:58.600 --> 14:02.080
 or a rattlesnake or four Xs on each bag.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.360
 You kind of got to knowing which was which

14:04.360 --> 14:05.720
 and they shipped a lot.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.600
 So, and he was just a gentleman.

14:09.600 --> 14:12.520
 I took the family, we went one weekend to his ranch

14:12.520 --> 14:17.520
 or his palatial place out near Barranquilla

14:17.520 --> 14:20.360
 and oh, he just treated the family.

14:20.360 --> 14:24.680
 His family had, his younger brother made a bull fight

14:24.680 --> 14:29.680
 and we had skiing and little airplanes on floats

14:30.280 --> 14:32.000
 on the water.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.160
 He was really nice and he was really nice.

14:36.200 --> 14:39.440
 How do you make sense of the tension

14:39.440 --> 14:42.040
 that a man could be a gentleman,

14:42.040 --> 14:44.680
 can have integrity, but also be a murderer?

14:44.680 --> 14:49.000
 Well, murder is a stronger word than killing.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.920
 Can you explain the line,

14:52.920 --> 14:55.000
 the gray area we're talking about?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.160
 I mean, I've just talking with Jocko Willing,

14:57.160 --> 15:00.400
 can we talk a lot about killing in the context

15:00.400 --> 15:05.400
 of military conflict in the context of war?

15:05.440 --> 15:08.720
 So there, there's a line between murder and killing

15:08.720 --> 15:09.920
 that you can draw.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.960
 What's the line that you're referring to?

15:11.960 --> 15:13.160
 It's something similar.

15:13.160 --> 15:14.920
 If people are shooting at you

15:14.920 --> 15:16.360
 and you shoot back and kill him,

15:16.360 --> 15:17.840
 that's not murder whatsoever.

15:17.840 --> 15:22.240
 He's trying to get away or out of the situation.

15:22.240 --> 15:25.560
 But if some woman don't pay you

15:25.560 --> 15:27.960
 and you send a hit man over to kill her

15:27.960 --> 15:30.840
 and her children, that's murder.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.280
 Was Jorge involved in those kinds of things?

15:33.280 --> 15:34.880
 I don't think so at all.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.480
 I mean, he was just such a gentleman.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.880
 He had a restaurant before and he was just smart.

15:39.880 --> 15:42.720
 I understand that the first 10 kilos he sold,

15:42.720 --> 15:46.200
 he was sitting on a motorcycle in the sidelines

15:46.200 --> 15:48.040
 in a parking lot and when the DEA come in,

15:48.040 --> 15:49.520
 he sped away.

15:49.520 --> 15:51.240
 So he didn't come back to America.

15:51.240 --> 15:52.080
 He was just smart.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.760
 Some people just are savvy.

15:53.760 --> 15:55.320
 And he was such a gentleman.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.680
 And the whole family, the mother and the father,

15:57.680 --> 15:59.760
 the two brothers, their sister,

15:59.760 --> 16:01.440
 I was there when she was kidnapped.

16:01.440 --> 16:05.560
 And finally, he kidnapped our, I guess,

16:05.560 --> 16:10.400
 100 leaders of the FARC and said, all right,

16:10.400 --> 16:11.240
 when she don't come back,

16:11.240 --> 16:13.320
 none of these are gonna come back.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.440
 So they made a deal.

16:15.440 --> 16:17.800
 Is there something you can say about the power structure,

16:17.800 --> 16:20.240
 the hierarchy of the Medellin cartel

16:20.240 --> 16:21.960
 that you interacted with?

16:21.960 --> 16:26.000
 Was it a dictatorship where Pablo ran everything?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.320
 Was there a bunch of power centers?

16:28.320 --> 16:32.640
 Was it like a company where you have CEO, CTO kind of thing?

16:32.640 --> 16:34.040
 And then there's like managers

16:34.040 --> 16:35.360
 and all those kinds of things.

16:35.360 --> 16:39.520
 How did it run from a leadership perspective?

16:39.520 --> 16:43.440
 I understand that about five of them got together

16:43.440 --> 16:46.920
 and made this, I would call it an insurance company.

16:46.920 --> 16:50.440
 And now known as the Medellin Cartel.

16:50.440 --> 16:51.640
 And I didn't see any difference.

16:51.640 --> 16:55.080
 Each one of them had their own business.

16:55.080 --> 16:59.880
 And their people from the jungle or wherever made the cocaine,

16:59.880 --> 17:02.120
 gave it to them and they shipped it.

17:02.120 --> 17:05.760
 And so it didn't seem to be any power play

17:05.760 --> 17:07.560
 between them at all.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.200
 But my main contact was Jorge Ochoa

17:10.200 --> 17:12.920
 and Pablo Escobar was right there.

17:12.920 --> 17:15.160
 And I saw plenty of stuff for him too.

17:16.040 --> 17:20.640
 It's strange that they didn't betray each other regularly.

17:20.640 --> 17:25.200
 You know, greed makes men betray each other.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.400
 How do you explain that?

17:27.400 --> 17:29.360
 How much betrayal did you see?

17:29.360 --> 17:32.720
 I didn't see any, absolutely none.

17:32.720 --> 17:36.280
 If they shipped his 100 kilos, he got paid for it.

17:36.280 --> 17:38.480
 And if the other one shipped his,

17:38.480 --> 17:39.960
 I'm sure they got paid for it.

17:39.960 --> 17:41.160
 How do you explain that?

17:42.200 --> 17:43.400
 Well, there was no need to.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.640
 The money was just unbelievable.

17:44.640 --> 17:47.920
 You think about 500 kilos in the plane

17:47.920 --> 17:51.760
 at $50,000 a kilo at the time.

17:53.760 --> 17:55.760
 And they paid $5,000 to ship it.

17:57.440 --> 18:00.560
 And they made 5,000 without even touching it.

18:00.560 --> 18:03.920
 They just had somebody to load it on through the airplane.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.640
 I gave it to their man in Miami.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.080
 They gave it to whoever it belonged to

18:07.080 --> 18:10.920
 by the marks on the duffel bags.

18:10.920 --> 18:14.160
 So they was making just untold millions.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.680
 Just no reason.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.400
 But greed can blind men.

18:20.960 --> 18:24.640
 It's still strange to me

18:24.640 --> 18:26.640
 that there was not more betrayal.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.800
 It speaks to something else perhaps

18:28.800 --> 18:30.160
 that's bigger than money.

18:31.520 --> 18:34.240
 Maybe not.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.120
 But it seems like just like in the casino,

18:36.120 --> 18:40.120
 like you mentioned, we get accustomed

18:40.120 --> 18:42.120
 to whatever level of money we have,

18:42.120 --> 18:43.680
 we get accustomed very quickly.

18:43.680 --> 18:44.640
 Yes.

18:44.640 --> 18:47.240
 And then there's a tension that's natural

18:47.240 --> 18:49.160
 between human beings.

18:49.160 --> 18:52.640
 And when that tension combined with money,

18:52.640 --> 18:54.720
 combined with power,

18:54.720 --> 18:57.600
 combined with, like you mentioned, beautiful women

18:57.600 --> 18:59.640
 and a bit of violence,

18:59.640 --> 19:04.600
 it seems that betrayal should be commonplace.

19:04.600 --> 19:05.440
 But it's not.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.040
 It wasn't, not at all.

19:07.040 --> 19:09.640
 Carlos later, I don't know if he betrayed anybody,

19:09.640 --> 19:10.840
 but he started that.

19:10.840 --> 19:13.240
 He was running cocaine through the Bahamas

19:13.240 --> 19:14.200
 near the island.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.040
 I didn't go.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.080
 I was offered to fly with a DC3 with that,

19:17.080 --> 19:18.520
 but I didn't like it.

19:18.520 --> 19:22.000
 So I had my route through the old wells in Louisiana.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.440
 And so I wasn't gonna change,

19:24.440 --> 19:27.200
 but he talked a lot and I don't know if he betrayed,

19:27.200 --> 19:28.440
 but they didn't like him.

19:28.440 --> 19:31.680
 Yeah, so as you expand,

19:31.680 --> 19:35.640
 there could be tensions that lead to conflict.

19:35.640 --> 19:39.360
 Columbia was, like you said, an ultra violent place.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.960
 How did you survive?

19:41.960 --> 19:43.440
 Who protected you?

19:43.440 --> 19:44.520
 I was a hero.

19:44.520 --> 19:45.560
 They liked me.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.480
 I mean, I was just treated royally.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.600
 All I did, I would come over El Banco.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.960
 There's a radio station at the Forks of the Magdalena River.

19:52.960 --> 19:57.120
 I believe it was 720, if I remember right, on the AM.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.840
 And I'd fly in at 10,000 feet

19:58.840 --> 20:01.440
 and I'd see below me there'd be a Cessna.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.600
 And I'd wiggle my wings and he'd wiggle his

20:03.600 --> 20:06.520
 and I'd fall in behind him and we might go 100, 200 miles.

20:06.520 --> 20:11.520
 I'd land on some jungle strip or some banana plantation.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.440
 And they'd fuel me up.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.680
 I could eat steak in the night.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.520
 It was just like treated royally.

20:17.520 --> 20:21.000
 And I mean, take off the next morning whenever I wanted to.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.920
 It was just like that was protected.

20:22.920 --> 20:25.960
 And I was honored guest.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.480
 It wasn't anything like in that movie,

20:27.480 --> 20:29.520
 putting a gun to your head

20:29.520 --> 20:31.560
 and taking your sunglasses and betting.

20:31.560 --> 20:35.120
 So one time I complained to Jorge Ochoa

20:35.120 --> 20:38.360
 that the runway was pretty short that they were using.

20:38.360 --> 20:39.840
 And I went back down and it looked like

20:39.840 --> 20:41.000
 Los Angeles International.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.480
 They had bulldozers in there.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.680
 Had that thing 5,000 feet long.

20:44.680 --> 20:47.520
 Just like, just the next week it was all done.

20:47.520 --> 20:50.320
 The jungle was gone and clay put up there.

20:50.320 --> 20:53.240
 And all the while you were not afraid.

20:53.240 --> 20:54.680
 You were treated like royalty.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.440
 Yes, there I was.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.680
 I was afraid when I landed in the United States.

20:58.680 --> 21:01.560
 Well, maybe let's go back to the beginning.

21:01.560 --> 21:04.720
 What was the first time you flew an airplane

21:04.720 --> 21:06.280
 with drugs on it?

21:06.280 --> 21:08.760
 Tell me the story of the first time you smuggled drugs.

21:08.760 --> 21:13.720
 All right, I flew down to Jalapa, Veracruz

21:13.720 --> 21:15.120
 with a Cessna 182.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.680
 And we landed at the town.

21:18.680 --> 21:20.760
 It was a lovely town and just an old town.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.200
 Looked like Bible times.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.560
 People, women were washing your clothes in the streets

21:24.560 --> 21:27.720
 and with stone basins and the stream running through.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.760
 I just was just dumbstruck.

21:29.760 --> 21:30.840
 It was just so pretty.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.960
 And I went in a church and a Catholic church

21:32.960 --> 21:34.720
 and it had the stations of the cross

21:34.720 --> 21:36.800
 all carved magnificent.

21:36.800 --> 21:37.960
 I'd never seen that.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.760
 And I come home and told Mary about that.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.640
 That just almost brought tears to my eyes.

21:41.640 --> 21:42.920
 It was so beautiful.

21:42.920 --> 21:44.640
 And three o clock the next morning

21:44.640 --> 21:47.120
 I went out to the airport and taxied down to the taxiway

21:47.120 --> 21:48.800
 and there was a guard came out

21:49.800 --> 21:52.240
 and wanted to know what I was doing.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.720
 And I pulled out, I was on the fire department

21:54.720 --> 21:56.480
 at Redondo Beach, California.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.680
 So I pulled out my wallet and in it was

21:58.680 --> 22:00.240
 the fire department badge.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.240
 And oh, he shook my hand and was so glad.

22:02.240 --> 22:05.600
 So I taxied on down there and we loaded up

22:05.600 --> 22:07.560
 about 400 pounds in the plane.

22:07.560 --> 22:11.400
 And came on back and I was running to headwinds

22:11.400 --> 22:14.440
 more than I thought and I landed on a little strip.

22:14.440 --> 22:16.400
 You're talking about on the way back?

22:16.400 --> 22:17.720
 On the way back, on the way north

22:17.720 --> 22:19.840
 after we loaded up early in the morning.

22:19.840 --> 22:22.560
 And that's the only time I ever got vertigo.

22:22.560 --> 22:25.680
 The mountains were coming down at a 30, 40 degree angle

22:25.680 --> 22:28.280
 and the Milky Way was overhead.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.880
 And somehow I wanted that airplane

22:29.880 --> 22:31.760
 to be level with the stars.

22:31.760 --> 22:35.480
 And it got me, it's a phenomenal pile of vertigo.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.760
 It's the only time I ever had it was on that load.

22:37.760 --> 22:40.080
 So anyway, the wind was on the nose of that system.

22:40.080 --> 22:43.440
 I wasn't gonna make it to the dry lake where I had fuel.

22:43.440 --> 22:44.880
 So I landed on a little bitty strip

22:44.880 --> 22:46.360
 and there was a little house.

22:46.360 --> 22:49.120
 It was caved in and it was a little boy named Lazarus,

22:49.120 --> 22:50.840
 about six or seven years old.

22:50.840 --> 22:52.680
 And he was herding some goats.

22:52.680 --> 22:54.400
 So we put the marijuana in that house

22:54.400 --> 22:57.280
 and the man stayed with it while I flew into some town

22:57.280 --> 22:59.400
 and got fuel and came back and we sat down

22:59.400 --> 23:00.640
 with the lunch that I brought back

23:00.640 --> 23:02.480
 and little Lazarus sat there and ate with us

23:02.480 --> 23:03.600
 and we had a good time.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.160
 We loaded on back and came on home.

23:05.160 --> 23:09.400
 Oh wow, I wonder where he is now.

23:09.400 --> 23:12.240
 So what was it like to fly,

23:12.240 --> 23:16.120
 maybe describe the details of, do you have to fly low?

23:16.120 --> 23:21.120
 Is there details that are unique to this experience

23:21.240 --> 23:24.480
 of flying an airplane with drugs on it, on board?

23:24.480 --> 23:26.200
 All right, well, one of the mistakes

23:26.200 --> 23:27.920
 that just thousands, hundreds and hundreds

23:27.920 --> 23:29.160
 and thousands of pilots make,

23:29.160 --> 23:30.680
 they don't stop at the border,

23:30.680 --> 23:33.320
 going down and get their permit.

23:33.320 --> 23:35.760
 Once you get a permit to be in Mexico,

23:35.760 --> 23:37.720
 you've got it for six months.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.680
 You can go anywhere, any fishing village,

23:39.680 --> 23:41.680
 any little town, any little place,

23:41.680 --> 23:43.320
 show them this and you're welcome.

23:43.320 --> 23:46.400
 If you don't have that, you go straight to jail.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.600
 So you go down there and you think,

23:47.600 --> 23:49.480
 okay, they're gonna have fuel for me to come back

23:49.480 --> 23:50.320
 and so forth.

23:50.320 --> 23:53.480
 Oh, sorry, Senor, that had a rusty leak in it.

23:53.480 --> 23:54.440
 We don't have any.

23:54.440 --> 23:57.120
 Well, you better be able to go to town and get it.

23:57.120 --> 23:58.680
 So that's what I did.

23:58.680 --> 24:01.600
 And when I was coming back for several years,

24:01.600 --> 24:06.600
 I would fly up at Mexicali and cross the border

24:06.720 --> 24:08.280
 right at Calexico.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.480
 I would act like I was landing on the Calexico side

24:10.480 --> 24:13.280
 just after dark and then I'd zip across the border

24:13.280 --> 24:14.960
 and I'd go over to the Salton Sea

24:14.960 --> 24:17.320
 and go below sea level, 100 and something feet,

24:17.320 --> 24:19.560
 I believe 170 feet, and come on up

24:19.560 --> 24:21.800
 and go out there above Palm Springs

24:21.800 --> 24:24.640
 and land at 29 Palms in the desert

24:24.640 --> 24:26.600
 and put my stuff under a Joshua tree

24:26.600 --> 24:28.600
 and fly into town and get my pickup

24:28.600 --> 24:29.720
 and go on back out and get it.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.280
 And that was fun.

24:31.280 --> 24:32.800
 And then it got really dangerous.

24:32.800 --> 24:36.120
 They had Operation Starlight, I believe was the name of it.

24:36.120 --> 24:39.360
 And they called a lot of pilots coming across the border.

24:39.360 --> 24:40.360
 So I changed it.

24:40.360 --> 24:42.080
 And by that time I was flying bigger planes.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.480
 I was flying Beach 18s.

24:44.480 --> 24:47.760
 And I would refuel in Mulahe halfway down

24:47.760 --> 24:50.480
 on the Baja Peninsula.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.440
 And then over in the middle,

24:52.440 --> 24:55.360
 20 miles from the nearest road was a goat ranch

24:55.360 --> 24:57.360
 where they milked goats and made cheese.

24:58.520 --> 25:00.400
 And I would go there and unload the load

25:00.400 --> 25:02.960
 coming up out of anywhere in Southern Mexico.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.360
 And I would land there and a guy named Juan

25:05.360 --> 25:09.360
 would put the marijuana under the trees

25:09.360 --> 25:11.960
 and I'd fly into Mulahe and they'd wash my plane

25:11.960 --> 25:15.200
 and gas it up and I'd eat a lunch

25:15.200 --> 25:18.400
 and rent a room for a few hours and take a nap and a shower

25:18.400 --> 25:20.400
 and then go back in the afternoon and fill up.

25:20.400 --> 25:23.280
 And then I would go Northwest out of there

25:23.280 --> 25:27.000
 and fly 200 miles off the coast of the island of Guadalupe.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.720
 And from there I would fly on a more Northwestern heading

25:29.720 --> 25:32.680
 about 300 miles out over the Pacific.

25:32.680 --> 25:35.360
 And then I would come in behind the Santa Barbara Islands

25:35.360 --> 25:38.880
 down low and then I'd come up and go out in the desert land.

25:38.880 --> 25:42.240
 And I did that for the rest of their marijuana trips.

25:44.720 --> 25:49.040
 What was the hardest part about flying those routes?

25:49.040 --> 25:51.360
 The hardest part was getting good in marijuana.

25:52.920 --> 25:54.640
 So the hardest part isn't the flying.

25:54.640 --> 25:55.480
 No, it's the flying.

25:55.480 --> 25:57.040
 It's just like driving your car down.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.560
 But then I had people that would bring me on strips

25:59.560 --> 26:02.120
 that were just unworthy of an airplane.

26:02.120 --> 26:07.120
 Like when I'd land on a highway and in the rainy season,

26:07.120 --> 26:08.400
 I would come back to land again

26:08.400 --> 26:10.360
 and the guy wouldn't think about it.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.080
 And he'd have like little hills on both sides

26:12.080 --> 26:14.280
 and the wings were out there.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.240
 Well, the grass and the weeds would grow up

26:16.240 --> 26:18.800
 and it sounded like, I mean,

26:18.800 --> 26:20.200
 it sounded like tearing the airplane apart

26:20.200 --> 26:21.320
 when those wings hit.

26:21.320 --> 26:24.600
 Mowing the grass down both shoulders of the airplane.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.800
 The weeds would grow up high in the tropics.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.200
 So some of that stuff was bad.

26:28.200 --> 26:31.320
 And oh, getting bad gasoline and telling me

26:31.320 --> 26:32.840
 that land here in the night

26:32.840 --> 26:35.880
 and knock the wheels off when you land.

26:35.880 --> 26:38.240
 Oh, you should have landed a little further up here,

26:38.240 --> 26:42.120
 Senor, they ditched down, that sort of thing.

26:42.120 --> 26:43.960
 What was it like landing on a highway

26:43.960 --> 26:46.440
 and when did you have to land on the highway?

26:46.440 --> 26:49.560
 I landed on the highway most of my life, most of the times.

26:49.560 --> 26:51.800
 In Mexico, first time I went down,

26:51.800 --> 26:54.080
 there was a place called Pichalingi

26:54.080 --> 26:56.560
 and it had a 900 foot strip.

26:56.560 --> 27:00.200
 And I would fly down and I'd carry gasoline wing with me

27:00.200 --> 27:03.400
 and Maury and I would go to the grocery store

27:03.400 --> 27:05.160
 and buy all kinds of little goodies and candies

27:05.160 --> 27:07.080
 and toys to bring to the children.

27:07.080 --> 27:12.080
 And that sand strip in the bend of a river

27:13.440 --> 27:15.320
 was just too short to take off with a load.

27:15.320 --> 27:17.200
 So there was a young man there named Pedro,

27:17.200 --> 27:20.040
 must not weigh much over 100, maybe 120 pounds.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.400
 And he'd get in a plane with me

27:22.400 --> 27:27.400
 and he'd direct me 20, 30, 40 miles away to a highway.

27:27.400 --> 27:30.880
 And the people walk in and the people would pull out

27:30.880 --> 27:32.840
 in a two ton truck with a machine gun on it

27:32.840 --> 27:35.960
 and a bunch of guys with arms with us

27:35.960 --> 27:37.240
 and they'd block the road

27:37.240 --> 27:39.400
 and then another one would block it up about a mile away.

27:39.400 --> 27:40.840
 And I'd land right over that truck

27:40.840 --> 27:43.520
 and they'd load me up and it looked like a bucket brigade

27:43.520 --> 27:44.560
 with the marijuana coming.

27:44.560 --> 27:45.960
 I'd shake hands with all of them

27:45.960 --> 27:48.240
 and I'd take off right over the other trucks.

27:48.240 --> 27:51.240
 And sometimes maybe 20, 30, 40 cars lined up.

27:51.240 --> 27:54.560
 One time I remember a patrol car, a highway patrol car,

27:55.440 --> 27:57.960
 he didn't have his lights on, took off right over him.

27:57.960 --> 28:00.960
 And then when I started flying to Louisiana,

28:00.960 --> 28:02.840
 the bridge over the Mississippi River,

28:02.840 --> 28:04.920
 there were several contractors that went broke

28:04.920 --> 28:07.440
 and that thing was out for years.

28:07.440 --> 28:08.920
 And about five miles from the river

28:08.920 --> 28:11.560
 was flashing red lights and a detour.

28:12.960 --> 28:14.680
 And then they swamp on both sides of it

28:14.680 --> 28:17.280
 and the middle of it we're growing up with 20 feet trees

28:17.280 --> 28:20.720
 and that was like an international runway

28:20.720 --> 28:22.680
 from anywhere in the world.

28:22.680 --> 28:25.080
 So I landed on that and over and over those red lights

28:25.080 --> 28:26.200
 just like the end of a runway.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.360
 And then the next morning we'd go out there

28:28.360 --> 28:31.800
 and scrub the marks off the highway where I'd landed

28:31.800 --> 28:33.320
 before daylight.

28:33.320 --> 28:34.560
 Wow.

28:34.560 --> 28:38.000
 Let's go to somebody you've known well,

28:38.000 --> 28:41.720
 somebody who's also a drug smuggler is Barry Seal.

28:42.840 --> 28:44.720
 Who is Barry Seal?

28:44.720 --> 28:45.800
 How did you meet him?

28:45.800 --> 28:47.400
 Barry Seal is a friend of mine.

28:50.280 --> 28:53.160
 Murray and I and the children went down in Honduras

28:53.160 --> 28:57.040
 and we went up Lake Azul, I believe it was,

28:57.040 --> 28:58.720
 and we were looking at a ranch to buy.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.280
 I was looking for something in Central America

29:00.280 --> 29:03.240
 where I'd have a halfway place.

29:03.240 --> 29:04.200
 Oh, it was lovely.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.680
 We stayed up there for some days and our clothes got muddy

29:06.680 --> 29:08.720
 and we went in the river and all kinds of things.

29:08.720 --> 29:10.920
 So we got to San Pedro Sula

29:10.920 --> 29:12.920
 and we was going back to New Orleans.

29:13.840 --> 29:17.520
 So we went to the cleaners to get our clothes

29:17.520 --> 29:19.680
 and most all of them was in there.

29:19.680 --> 29:22.440
 And they go, oh, Senor, they'll be ready tomorrow morning.

29:22.440 --> 29:23.320
 We're not ready now.

29:23.320 --> 29:27.400
 Well, the plane leaves at nine o clock or whatever.

29:27.400 --> 29:30.680
 So I told Murray for her and the children

29:30.680 --> 29:32.600
 to go into the airport because it'd be easier

29:32.600 --> 29:35.280
 for one just on a standby flight.

29:35.280 --> 29:39.400
 So I went to the laundromat for the clothes

29:39.400 --> 29:41.440
 and they were ready and there was a pile of them.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.160
 And I put them on my back and got in a taxi

29:43.160 --> 29:44.800
 and the old taxi would drive him with it

29:44.800 --> 29:46.480
 and I'd give him a hundred dollars to go faster

29:46.480 --> 29:48.600
 and he just blew his horn more rapid.

29:48.600 --> 29:53.000
 So finally we got to the airport

29:53.000 --> 29:55.320
 and I jumped out and ran around on the tarmac

29:55.320 --> 29:59.600
 and here's a brand new 727 taxiing out.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.160
 Oh no.

30:01.160 --> 30:04.040
 So I'm waving to the pilot and he's a young fella.

30:04.040 --> 30:05.800
 He waves back.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.520
 Then I see Murray's face in the cockpit

30:07.520 --> 30:09.960
 and the nose goes down where he puts on brakes

30:09.960 --> 30:12.560
 and he laughs and he puts some stairwell out.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.800
 And I run for the stairwell and he pulls it back up

30:14.800 --> 30:16.680
 and goes like a hitchhiker going to pick you up

30:16.680 --> 30:17.640
 and go again.

30:18.880 --> 30:21.680
 Then he put it out and I got on and the whole crowd clapped

30:21.680 --> 30:23.960
 and I'm coming home with that load of clothes.

30:26.240 --> 30:29.520
 So I go way down in the middle and the plane's full

30:29.520 --> 30:32.400
 and Miriam, my daughter, was about nine years old then

30:32.400 --> 30:33.880
 and she was sitting in the middle

30:33.880 --> 30:35.680
 and by the window was Barry Seal.

30:35.680 --> 30:36.680
 Of course I didn't know it.

30:36.680 --> 30:39.960
 And I sat in the middle and we took off

30:39.960 --> 30:42.160
 and the wheels come up with clunk

30:42.160 --> 30:43.840
 and then I got up about 5,000 feet

30:43.840 --> 30:45.680
 and we had a little clunk and she said,

30:45.680 --> 30:46.520
 what was that, daddy?

30:46.520 --> 30:49.160
 And I said, he just turned on his autopilot.

30:49.160 --> 30:51.000
 And that fella reached over and I looked at him.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
 I said, he looks like CIA or FBI, something.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.440
 He ain't supposed to be here.

30:56.440 --> 30:59.320
 Clear blue eyes, gentleman looking man.

30:59.320 --> 31:01.880
 And he said, you fly these things?

31:01.880 --> 31:03.240
 I said, I got a few hours, mister.

31:03.240 --> 31:05.040
 He said, I'll fly them too or something.

31:05.040 --> 31:06.240
 And he said, my name's Barry Seal.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.480
 And he reached over Miriam and shook hands

31:08.480 --> 31:11.800
 and we got to talking and I thought,

31:11.800 --> 31:13.520
 there's no choice of seats on this.

31:13.520 --> 31:16.840
 It's just open seating so I don't believe him one bit.

31:18.560 --> 31:19.600
 And he started talking about,

31:19.600 --> 31:21.200
 he just got out of jail that morning.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.360
 Just got out of prison.

31:23.320 --> 31:24.400
 And I said, uh huh.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.280
 And he told me that he'd been a pilot

31:28.280 --> 31:31.200
 with the TWA and this and other.

31:31.200 --> 31:33.880
 And told me what he was for.

31:33.880 --> 31:35.480
 So we had a nice conversation

31:35.480 --> 31:37.240
 for a couple hours to New Orleans.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.200
 I didn't believe him.

31:39.200 --> 31:40.680
 So he got off in front of us

31:40.680 --> 31:44.080
 and what a crowd of people to meet him.

31:44.080 --> 31:46.840
 An old mother and a wife and little children

31:46.840 --> 31:49.200
 hanging on to him, crying and hugging and kissing him.

31:49.200 --> 31:51.160
 I said, he was telling the truth.

31:53.440 --> 31:56.160
 So I reached over and gave him a little piece of paper.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.880
 I had Murray to write it out with our address.

31:57.880 --> 32:00.040
 I said, Barry, I might have some work for you.

32:00.040 --> 32:00.880
 Come on out.

32:00.880 --> 32:01.720
 What was he in jail for?

32:01.720 --> 32:04.760
 He got caught with 100 kilos of cocaine in a small plane.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.800
 And so he served a year.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.040
 And that was from Colombia?

32:10.040 --> 32:11.200
 I don't know where it come from.

32:11.200 --> 32:14.120
 He got caught in Honduras, probably refueling.

32:14.120 --> 32:17.360
 But he'd been in prison down there before

32:17.360 --> 32:21.440
 for bringing explosives to the Cuban Contras.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.640
 And he lost his job with the airlines.

32:23.640 --> 32:25.720
 And then later on, I found out he was ex CIA

32:25.720 --> 32:27.720
 and George Bush Sr.'s protege

32:27.720 --> 32:32.320
 and had a thousand parachute jumps and was there.

32:32.320 --> 32:33.680
 He was a hot shot model.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.360
 There's a million questions I wanna ask here.

32:37.360 --> 32:41.160
 But maybe can we linger on a little bit longer?

32:41.160 --> 32:43.200
 What was your relationship with him like?

32:44.880 --> 32:47.000
 You were a drug smuggler.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.440
 He's a drug smuggler.

32:50.400 --> 32:53.720
 Your friends, how often do you guys talk?

32:53.720 --> 32:55.280
 How often do you work together?

32:56.120 --> 32:58.200
 What was the relationship like?

32:58.200 --> 33:01.480
 Well, I'll back up and finish where I started off there.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.720
 I gave him the things, Barry,

33:02.720 --> 33:03.640
 I may have some work for you.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.280
 I know I got some work for you.

33:05.280 --> 33:08.600
 And I said, come out to Santa Barbara.

33:08.600 --> 33:10.760
 And so I don't know, a week or two later,

33:10.760 --> 33:12.600
 he flew out and went to our house

33:12.600 --> 33:14.360
 and stayed with us a couple of days.

33:14.360 --> 33:18.440
 And I had a almost brand new Aero Commander 690B.

33:18.440 --> 33:20.440
 That thing with turbo prop and it was hot.

33:20.440 --> 33:22.640
 It was the hottest thing I'd ever had.

33:22.640 --> 33:25.320
 So I said, let's go Barry, let's see what you can do.

33:26.400 --> 33:27.920
 So I'm sorry I said that.

33:27.920 --> 33:30.160
 We got about 10,000 feet.

33:30.160 --> 33:32.200
 And he was like one of them blue angel pilots.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.080
 He rung that thing out.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.000
 And I said, that's enough.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.160
 And then he did a falling leaf.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.280
 That's where you cut the engines

33:39.280 --> 33:41.480
 and the plane falls from side to side.

33:41.480 --> 33:43.760
 And I saw Bob Hoover do that in the air show once.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.640
 And that's the only person I ever saw do it.

33:45.640 --> 33:49.360
 And I was, my hands was white knuckle hanging onto the seat.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.680
 You shut off the engine?

33:50.680 --> 33:51.840
 Yeah, he shut off the engines

33:51.840 --> 33:54.640
 and landed flying side by side like this.

33:54.640 --> 33:55.800
 How do you explain that?

33:55.800 --> 33:58.360
 Was he just a wild man

33:58.360 --> 34:00.360
 or was he sufficiently skilled to work?

34:00.360 --> 34:01.960
 He was sufficiently skilled.

34:01.960 --> 34:02.920
 Absolutely.

34:02.920 --> 34:05.080
 He knew what he was doing.

34:05.080 --> 34:06.680
 I can get a plane from one spot to another

34:06.680 --> 34:08.160
 and I guess I'm known as a good pilot,

34:08.160 --> 34:10.280
 but that guy, it was an aerobatic.

34:10.280 --> 34:15.120
 So anyway, he stayed with us a couple of days.

34:15.120 --> 34:18.520
 And then I told him, I said, this plane needs tanking.

34:18.520 --> 34:20.200
 And I said, I got some work down in Columbia.

34:20.200 --> 34:21.960
 It needs to come back to Louisiana.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.880
 And I need 2,500 mile range.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.840
 He said, I got somebody in Mena, Arkansas

34:25.840 --> 34:27.480
 to do that and keep their mouth shut.

34:27.480 --> 34:30.560
 So I gave him $10,000 and he flew away.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.560
 And in a few days he called me and says,

34:32.560 --> 34:35.560
 come to my house in Baton Rouge.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.440
 So I went out to his house in Baton Rouge

34:37.440 --> 34:39.400
 and I stayed with him for a few days.

34:39.400 --> 34:40.960
 And that plane was tanked.

34:40.960 --> 34:43.520
 I mean, beautiful from stem to stern.

34:43.520 --> 34:47.280
 I could went from Bolivia to Canada with it.

34:47.280 --> 34:51.400
 So then I hired him to fly.

34:51.400 --> 34:52.760
 And he was funny.

34:52.760 --> 34:54.440
 I paid him a million dollars a trip.

34:54.440 --> 34:57.560
 I paid him $2,000 a kilo, so about a million dollar trip.

34:57.560 --> 35:01.600
 And I didn't get paid until the people received it.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.000
 They had to ship it to Chicago and New York

35:04.000 --> 35:05.120
 and then the money come back.

35:05.120 --> 35:07.880
 So it was a couple of two or three weeks pipeline.

35:07.880 --> 35:10.840
 Well, I always had to pay him before he'd go again.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.920
 I mean, and he barely ache.

35:12.920 --> 35:15.360
 I mean, he had moaning room.

35:15.360 --> 35:19.920
 So one time I gave him a million dollars

35:19.920 --> 35:21.600
 and I put it in a box real nice.

35:21.600 --> 35:23.960
 So how big is a box that contains a million dollars?

35:23.960 --> 35:25.240
 So we're talking about a hundred dollar bills?

35:25.240 --> 35:26.480
 A hundred dollar bill, it's not very big.

35:26.480 --> 35:28.280
 You can put it in a large briefcase.

35:29.480 --> 35:31.680
 It weighs exactly 10 kilos.

35:31.680 --> 35:34.840
 Each bill weighs a gram, so you can weigh your money

35:34.840 --> 35:36.720
 and almost get it exactly right.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.680
 20 something pounds is a million dollars.

35:38.680 --> 35:39.800
 22 pounds.

35:39.800 --> 35:40.920
 22 pounds.

35:40.920 --> 35:42.200
 A hundred dollar bills.

35:42.200 --> 35:45.960
 But in one dollar bills, it's one ton, 2,200 pounds.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.400
 We didn't even accept them.

35:49.400 --> 35:51.200
 Were you the one that introduced Barry Seal

35:51.200 --> 35:53.160
 to Pablo Escobar?

35:53.160 --> 35:55.960
 No, I didn't introduce him at all.

35:55.960 --> 36:00.240
 And our deal was that you don't meet my people.

36:00.240 --> 36:02.280
 I mean, we just kind of crossed your working for me

36:02.280 --> 36:03.480
 to fly the airplanes.

36:03.480 --> 36:05.240
 So he wanted these Panther conversions

36:05.240 --> 36:09.640
 that cost $400,000 each with a storm scope and radar.

36:09.640 --> 36:11.440
 I bought anything you want.

36:11.440 --> 36:12.840
 What's that mean, sorry to interrupt,

36:12.840 --> 36:14.440
 Panther conversions?

36:14.440 --> 36:18.280
 Panther conversion was, these people called Panther,

36:18.280 --> 36:20.960
 they took everything out from the firewall,

36:20.960 --> 36:22.880
 the instruments and all and converted them

36:22.880 --> 36:25.600
 and put Q tip propellers on them full bladed

36:25.600 --> 36:28.680
 and you very quiet and the CIA developed those

36:28.680 --> 36:31.880
 in Southeast Asia for running behind the lines.

36:31.880 --> 36:33.560
 And that's where Barry had flown those things

36:33.560 --> 36:35.040
 so he knew about them.

36:35.040 --> 36:38.280
 So that's what he wanted and that's what we got him.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.880
 How does that connect to Pablo?

36:39.880 --> 36:42.840
 And so he worked for you and you got those upgrades.

36:42.840 --> 36:44.600
 I think he flew about 30 loads for me

36:44.600 --> 36:48.840
 and then I got arrested and was for everything in the world.

36:48.840 --> 36:51.080
 Got 35 years sentence.

36:51.080 --> 36:52.400
 But let me back up a little bit.

36:52.400 --> 36:55.880
 Barry was our friend.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.360
 Mari and I are both friends.

36:57.360 --> 37:02.360
 We should pause real quick and say Mari is your wife

37:02.360 --> 37:07.360
 and hopefully we'll convince her to join us in a little bit.

37:07.880 --> 37:11.240
 She's the love of your life and sort of she weaves in

37:11.240 --> 37:13.520
 and out of many of these stories that you tell.

37:13.520 --> 37:15.280
 Yes, she was there.

37:15.280 --> 37:16.640
 She was behind the scenes.

37:16.640 --> 37:18.920
 But I kept her out of it completely.

37:18.920 --> 37:21.920
 And then also you mentioned Mariam as your daughter.

37:21.920 --> 37:25.080
 Yes, our son was a baby.

37:25.080 --> 37:27.440
 And I remember we went out to a festival,

37:27.440 --> 37:29.640
 was my favorite restaurant in Carl Gables.

37:29.640 --> 37:31.600
 Oh God, it was good.

37:31.600 --> 37:32.840
 And Barry knew about it.

37:32.840 --> 37:34.160
 Anyhow, we went out to dinner

37:34.160 --> 37:38.160
 and so we came back and there was no rooms.

37:38.160 --> 37:40.480
 So Barry will spend the night with us.

37:40.480 --> 37:42.040
 So he goes to our hotel room with us

37:42.040 --> 37:45.680
 and we got two big beds in the Omni Hotel

37:45.680 --> 37:47.000
 and he lays over there and he gets down

37:47.000 --> 37:49.600
 to his stripy undershorts and his T shirt

37:49.600 --> 37:51.840
 and he puts the baby up on his belly

37:51.840 --> 37:52.800
 and gives him the bottle and said,

37:52.800 --> 37:54.520
 mm, ain't that good, Red?

37:54.520 --> 37:55.360
 Oh my, my.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.720
 And he just feeds the baby.

37:56.720 --> 38:00.160
 We laugh and talk and that's how close we were

38:00.160 --> 38:03.240
 that we could all stay in a hotel room together.

38:03.240 --> 38:04.760
 And would you say he's a good man?

38:04.760 --> 38:06.440
 Oh, wonderful man.

38:06.440 --> 38:09.160
 A gentleman, Southern gentleman.

38:09.160 --> 38:11.800
 Just looked after his mother, his family,

38:11.800 --> 38:14.240
 everybody around him, everybody loved Barry.

38:14.240 --> 38:18.280
 He just had a little smile on his face always.

38:18.280 --> 38:21.480
 So you got arrested and then what happened to Barry?

38:21.480 --> 38:26.280
 Well, Barry knew the people that unloaded.

38:26.280 --> 38:28.400
 Of course he sent the cars down and all that.

38:28.400 --> 38:31.600
 So he met the unloader, a guy named Lito,

38:31.600 --> 38:35.200
 Luis Carlos Bustamante of Venezuelan.

38:35.200 --> 38:37.320
 So he just kept on flying.

38:37.320 --> 38:40.240
 But he, I believe he had three of my airplanes

38:40.240 --> 38:42.760
 at $400,000 a piece and they owed me some money.

38:42.760 --> 38:45.320
 Well, he collected a lot of that and gave Marie the money

38:45.320 --> 38:48.160
 and put it in his safe and took her to his house

38:48.160 --> 38:50.600
 and all after I got arrested and sent a lawyer in.

38:50.600 --> 38:54.000
 He got me the best lawyer in the country, Albert Krieger.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.720
 He was head of the defense team for all of America.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.780
 Wonderful man.

38:58.780 --> 39:03.040
 Can you tell the story of the months

39:03.040 --> 39:05.880
 that led up to Barry's assassination?

39:05.880 --> 39:10.000
 What did you know, what did you sense, what did you think?

39:10.000 --> 39:12.200
 Okay, when I got out of prison, I hadn't been out long.

39:12.200 --> 39:16.680
 I was eating breakfast and there was Ronald Reagan's face

39:16.680 --> 39:18.360
 right in the television.

39:18.360 --> 39:21.240
 We have absolute proof that the communist

39:21.240 --> 39:24.700
 Sandinista government is in the cocaine running business.

39:24.700 --> 39:29.300
 And there was that fat lady, the C126 on the runway

39:29.300 --> 39:33.800
 with the belly down and I thought, oh God, he had done it.

39:34.660 --> 39:37.600
 So I had heard that Barry might've been working with him.

39:38.560 --> 39:39.400
 So it wasn't long before.

39:39.400 --> 39:40.220
 Working with?

39:40.220 --> 39:44.720
 With the DEA or whoever, he was no longer on our side.

39:45.720 --> 39:48.120
 So can you clarify how you got that

39:48.120 --> 39:52.000
 from the Reagan making a statement about we've heard.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
 Okay, there was his plane.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.120
 There was Barry's plane and okay, on the way north,

39:57.120 --> 40:00.080
 we could stop in Nicaragua and land on a military base

40:00.080 --> 40:03.560
 or on a base that they used as crop dusters and all

40:03.560 --> 40:06.600
 and refuel and so that shortened our trip.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.400
 We'd go further into the jungle and come up

40:08.400 --> 40:10.680
 and that was what Pablo Escobar and Ochoa and them

40:10.680 --> 40:15.520
 and they was associates with the people in Nicaragua.

40:15.520 --> 40:19.200
 So Barry was, if that plane was there,

40:19.200 --> 40:22.800
 that means Barry was feeding the DEA information.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.400
 He was working with them at that time.

40:24.400 --> 40:25.720
 But let me back up a little bit.

40:25.720 --> 40:28.140
 When I was flying and I told Barry,

40:28.140 --> 40:31.680
 we would refuel in Trange Airplane,

40:31.680 --> 40:35.040
 the loads in Belize where I had a spot up there

40:35.040 --> 40:37.920
 and then that's when they told me

40:37.920 --> 40:42.640
 we can refuel in Nicaragua and then you fly all the way

40:42.640 --> 40:44.480
 and Barry couldn't believe it.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.120
 He says, all right, but I wanted you to land.

40:46.120 --> 40:49.420
 I had a place in Louisiana for $10,000

40:49.420 --> 40:53.000
 that I could unload and the sheriff and all them was paid off.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.200
 And he said, no, no, no.

40:56.280 --> 40:58.560
 I can't get caught in Meena, Arkansas.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.320
 I said, what do you mean you can't get caught

41:00.320 --> 41:01.160
 in Meena, Arkansas?

41:01.160 --> 41:02.960
 You get caught anywhere.

41:02.960 --> 41:06.760
 He said, I can't, but it's gonna cost you $50,000

41:06.760 --> 41:08.600
 every time my wheels touch the ground.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.960
 Why, can you explain why he can't get caught

41:11.960 --> 41:12.800
 in Meena, Arkansas?

41:12.800 --> 41:15.860
 He said he was hooked up with him at the very top

41:15.860 --> 41:17.840
 and he even said, I'm gonna have dinner

41:17.840 --> 41:19.720
 with the governor tonight.

41:19.720 --> 41:21.280
 That's at that time.

41:21.280 --> 41:22.120
 Meena, Arkansas.

41:22.120 --> 41:23.480
 Mr. Bill Clinton.

41:23.480 --> 41:25.040
 Undoubtedly.

41:25.040 --> 41:26.640
 And it's like, did Bill Clinton,

41:26.640 --> 41:27.800
 did you give him any money?

41:27.800 --> 41:30.400
 And I said, no, I never gave the man any money,

41:30.400 --> 41:31.640
 but it was like the money that I had

41:31.640 --> 41:32.960
 that went to Grand Cayman Islands

41:32.960 --> 41:35.960
 and I told my lawyer, I said, I never touched that money.

41:35.960 --> 41:38.880
 He said, you don't have to fondle it to be guilty.

41:38.880 --> 41:40.040
 So.

41:40.040 --> 41:43.480
 So what, I mean, there's a lot of conspiracy theories

41:43.480 --> 41:46.480
 around the relationship between Barry Seal and the Clintons.

41:46.480 --> 41:47.400
 Absolutely.

41:47.400 --> 41:50.480
 What evidence do we have?

41:50.480 --> 41:53.600
 What would you say from your best understanding

41:55.480 --> 41:57.000
 of what was the relationship

41:57.000 --> 41:59.520
 between Bill Clinton and Barry Seal?

41:59.520 --> 42:02.600
 Barry said, and he knew that he couldn't get caught

42:02.600 --> 42:04.520
 in Meena, Arkansas.

42:04.520 --> 42:05.960
 And when that movie was gonna come out,

42:05.960 --> 42:09.800
 be called Meena, somebody stopped it.

42:09.800 --> 42:11.360
 I mean, they stopped it dead in the tracks

42:11.360 --> 42:14.120
 for two or three years and the producer even quit.

42:14.120 --> 42:16.320
 You mean the American Made with Tom Cruise movie?

42:16.320 --> 42:17.160
 It wasn't American.

42:17.160 --> 42:18.080
 It was gonna be called Meena?

42:18.080 --> 42:20.760
 It's the name that was written and produced in Meena.

42:21.680 --> 42:25.160
 And waiting on Hillary to be elected,

42:25.160 --> 42:27.920
 they would not let that movie out.

42:27.920 --> 42:30.080
 And that movie was changed drastically.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.560
 But to push back on that,

42:31.560 --> 42:33.320
 that doesn't mean there's truth there.

42:33.320 --> 42:35.840
 That means they were worried about

42:35.840 --> 42:39.440
 the power of the conspiracy theory, which stuck.

42:39.440 --> 42:40.280
 Exactly.

42:40.280 --> 42:41.640
 But I don't know.

42:41.640 --> 42:44.600
 I mean, you know, some conspiracy theories,

42:44.600 --> 42:47.320
 just because they're popular doesn't mean they're true.

42:47.320 --> 42:51.160
 And ones that, but it also doesn't mean they're not true.

42:51.160 --> 42:53.080
 And there's ones that are not very popular

42:53.080 --> 42:54.080
 that could be true.

42:54.080 --> 42:56.920
 But that one really stuck.

42:58.320 --> 43:00.120
 I mean, what's your sense?

43:00.120 --> 43:01.680
 Well, I paid one and a half million dollars

43:01.680 --> 43:03.800
 for Barry to land at Meena, Arkansas.

43:03.800 --> 43:07.200
 So I was pretty well assured that he couldn't get caught.

43:08.840 --> 43:10.840
 And I said, well, I can't get caught in Columbia.

43:10.840 --> 43:12.200
 We can't get caught in Nicaragua.

43:12.200 --> 43:14.680
 I guess we got a license.

43:14.680 --> 43:15.520
 So we went for it.

43:15.520 --> 43:17.240
 Oh, so when you say I can't get caught,

43:17.240 --> 43:19.680
 just to clarify, there's a sense

43:19.680 --> 43:22.000
 where this is a safe place to land.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.920
 Yes, like completely safe.

43:23.920 --> 43:25.360
 So you don't think he was referring

43:25.360 --> 43:28.560
 to some kind of, you know,

43:29.640 --> 43:33.480
 like my grandfather who fought in World War II

43:33.480 --> 43:36.200
 would talk about bullets can't hit him.

43:36.200 --> 43:39.320
 So it's almost like believing.

43:39.320 --> 43:41.800
 He was taking that $50,000 and giving it to somebody.

43:41.800 --> 43:43.520
 And Barry was honest.

43:43.520 --> 43:45.120
 So he wasn't just taking it from me

43:45.120 --> 43:46.520
 because he was making a million dollars.

43:46.520 --> 43:48.080
 He didn't care for the $50,000.

43:49.040 --> 43:52.360
 Oh man, taking the story forward,

43:53.440 --> 43:55.680
 the months leading up to his assassination,

43:55.680 --> 44:00.680
 what would you understand why he was assassinated?

44:01.040 --> 44:02.760
 Who were the players involved?

44:04.880 --> 44:06.480
 Maybe could you have stopped it?

44:08.000 --> 44:10.560
 Well, I'll tell you, after I saw Reagan's face

44:10.560 --> 44:13.920
 on the television saying we have the absolute proof,

44:13.920 --> 44:15.960
 the phone rang and it was Barry.

44:15.960 --> 44:18.640
 I hadn't heard from him in a couple of years.

44:18.640 --> 44:20.560
 He said, I'm coming out tonight, Roger.

44:21.800 --> 44:22.760
 And I, oh boy.

44:23.720 --> 44:26.160
 So he came out and he said,

44:26.160 --> 44:28.240
 I'll meet you in this French restaurant.

44:28.240 --> 44:30.120
 I don't even know it in Santa Barbara.

44:30.120 --> 44:33.400
 And I walked in, there's about 20 or 30 people in there.

44:33.400 --> 44:35.200
 And they was all 30, 40 years old,

44:35.200 --> 44:38.960
 women with plastic or leather skirts

44:38.960 --> 44:40.600
 and me in the blue jeans.

44:40.600 --> 44:42.640
 And I looked around and Barry was at the back.

44:42.640 --> 44:45.080
 He was leaned up, he had gained weight.

44:45.080 --> 44:47.720
 And I walked up and I said, Barry, you wired.

44:47.720 --> 44:48.680
 He said, no.

44:48.680 --> 44:51.480
 I said, well, I'm not gonna talk to these DE agents.

44:51.480 --> 44:53.080
 He said, every one of them.

44:53.080 --> 44:53.920
 So.

44:53.920 --> 44:58.920
 Oh, with jeans and skirts, I like it.

45:00.600 --> 45:02.040
 I said, well, Barry, I'm gonna set you

45:02.040 --> 45:03.480
 and you just talk to me, buddy,

45:03.480 --> 45:05.680
 and tell me what's on your mind.

45:05.680 --> 45:07.320
 And he sat there and he just went to talking.

45:07.320 --> 45:10.440
 And he told me about, he was left holding a bag.

45:11.280 --> 45:12.120
 And it.

45:13.320 --> 45:14.560
 What do you mean by that?

45:14.560 --> 45:16.720
 Like that nobody's supported him?

45:16.720 --> 45:18.400
 Well, I think it's something or another.

45:18.400 --> 45:21.080
 He was, and I don't know this.

45:21.080 --> 45:25.200
 I mean, this is just what happened, putting it all together.

45:25.200 --> 45:28.760
 He had some CIA buddies that was pretending

45:28.760 --> 45:32.080
 we're going to supply all of our Northwood arms.

45:32.080 --> 45:35.520
 And with that, you can land cocaine back here by the ton.

45:35.520 --> 45:38.880
 So he's taking his little planes and putting some AK 47s

45:38.880 --> 45:41.320
 and maybe ammunition or whatever,

45:41.320 --> 45:44.520
 and takes it down to the Contras

45:44.520 --> 45:47.880
 against the Communist Party of Nicaragua,

45:47.880 --> 45:49.360
 where we've been landing.

45:49.360 --> 45:51.360
 And Oliver North was involved in this.

45:51.360 --> 45:55.880
 So when all that, and so his CIA buddies

45:55.880 --> 45:59.440
 was certainly involved, and we know they were.

45:59.440 --> 46:01.840
 And Barry had been in the CIA earlier

46:01.840 --> 46:04.000
 when he first got out of school.

46:04.000 --> 46:09.000
 So when, as I say, the shit hit the fan,

46:10.880 --> 46:13.720
 they all fled and left Barry holding the bag.

46:13.720 --> 46:15.400
 The CIA and the DEA.

46:15.400 --> 46:17.960
 Yeah, not the DEA, the CIA.

46:17.960 --> 46:19.120
 The DEA wasn't in on it.

46:19.120 --> 46:22.480
 The CIA was selling that cocaine, bringing it in.

46:22.480 --> 46:23.480
 And.

46:23.480 --> 46:28.120
 Just to clarify, what's Iran Contra scandal?

46:28.120 --> 46:31.720
 What was the alleged involvement of the CIA

46:31.720 --> 46:36.720
 in using drug trade to fund things?

46:37.120 --> 46:38.760
 What do you know?

46:38.760 --> 46:40.960
 What do you think is true?

46:40.960 --> 46:42.560
 What should we know?

46:42.560 --> 46:44.760
 Well, I know what I knew was true,

46:44.760 --> 46:48.000
 that Barry was taking a small amount of arms

46:48.000 --> 46:50.920
 back to Central America and giving them to

46:50.920 --> 46:54.160
 whoever Oliver North group were.

46:54.160 --> 46:55.000
 Who's Oliver North?

46:55.000 --> 46:57.200
 Oliver North was a colonel that got implemented

46:57.200 --> 46:58.680
 and almost brought the government down.

46:58.680 --> 46:59.920
 And so they said, all right,

46:59.920 --> 47:02.000
 we're getting the guns from Iran

47:02.000 --> 47:04.400
 and we're taking cocaine to pay for them.

47:04.400 --> 47:06.920
 And since Congress won't give us money to fight this war,

47:06.920 --> 47:10.120
 we're gonna circumvent it.

47:10.120 --> 47:12.160
 So that was a whole thing.

47:12.160 --> 47:16.480
 So it was a CIA's effort to circumvent

47:16.480 --> 47:20.880
 the funding mechanisms of government by selling drugs.

47:20.880 --> 47:24.800
 Yes, but it was a handful of renegade CIA agents

47:24.800 --> 47:28.720
 that were Barry's friends that was making a load,

47:28.720 --> 47:31.320
 a load of money, tons of it come up.

47:31.320 --> 47:33.360
 If you would like to read the book,

47:33.360 --> 47:37.560
 The Big White Lie, The CIA and the Crack Cocaine Epidemic,

47:37.560 --> 47:39.880
 the CIA put, according to this,

47:40.960 --> 47:43.920
 the book and Michael Levine,

47:43.920 --> 47:46.400
 I didn't remember his name last time I talked,

47:47.560 --> 47:50.360
 wrote that book and he was a head CIA agent,

47:50.360 --> 47:53.920
 he was a head DEA agent that exposed this.

47:53.920 --> 47:55.680
 And the CIA tried to kill him.

47:55.680 --> 47:57.840
 And he says, they put crack cocaine, they developed,

47:57.840 --> 48:00.400
 their chemists developed crack.

48:00.400 --> 48:02.760
 And they put it in every city in the United States

48:02.760 --> 48:04.160
 on one weekend.

48:04.160 --> 48:06.640
 So they were bringing it up by the tons

48:06.640 --> 48:07.600
 and that's for sure.

48:07.600 --> 48:09.600
 And Barry was bringing it.

48:09.600 --> 48:12.720
 Can I ask you a small tangent question?

48:12.720 --> 48:17.720
 Do you think the public should trust the CIA and the DEA?

48:18.680 --> 48:20.740
 Do you think they're mostly good people

48:20.740 --> 48:23.840
 that are carrying out a good mission?

48:23.840 --> 48:25.640
 Because this kind of makes it sound

48:25.640 --> 48:28.640
 like there's renegade agents that are just doing

48:28.640 --> 48:29.960
 whatever the hell they want

48:29.960 --> 48:34.120
 and with sometimes no regard for human life.

48:34.120 --> 48:35.400
 Well, that's certainly true.

48:35.400 --> 48:36.800
 But that's not everybody in there.

48:36.800 --> 48:39.440
 That's just, sometimes you get a few policemen

48:39.440 --> 48:41.600
 in the department that do these things.

48:41.600 --> 48:45.080
 I don't believe, I believe that our government is good.

48:45.080 --> 48:46.760
 I think we've got some fools running it.

48:46.760 --> 48:47.880
 I don't know how we get them there,

48:47.880 --> 48:51.200
 but I don't think I know.

48:51.200 --> 48:54.440
 Okay, so what was Barry's involvement here?

48:54.440 --> 48:56.680
 So Barry leaned back in that chair

48:56.680 --> 49:01.680
 and he told me that he got caught with one and a half tons

49:02.160 --> 49:06.000
 and he bellied it in the runway in Nicaragua

49:06.000 --> 49:11.000
 and had cameras flashing inside and out.

49:11.560 --> 49:14.200
 And he flew it back to Homestead with an agent there

49:14.200 --> 49:18.680
 and he brought the agent over, Jake Jacobson.

49:18.680 --> 49:21.040
 Really nice fellow, I think he was a crop duster.

49:21.040 --> 49:23.400
 And we'd have got along if we'd have been on the right side.

49:23.400 --> 49:26.320
 And so we sat there and drank Chevy's Regal

49:26.320 --> 49:29.400
 until I got pie eyed and Barry told me about it.

49:29.400 --> 49:31.360
 He said that he went to see Edwin Meese.

49:31.360 --> 49:33.160
 He flew his, he got out on bail

49:33.160 --> 49:35.760
 and he flew his Lear jet up to Washington

49:35.760 --> 49:39.000
 and went in to see the Attorney General, Edwin Meese.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.240
 And they run him out of the office.

49:41.240 --> 49:42.360
 The next day he went back and said,

49:42.360 --> 49:45.480
 I have absolute proof that the CIA

49:45.480 --> 49:47.000
 is bringing tons of cocaine

49:48.040 --> 49:50.520
 or they're running tons of cocaine into the United States.

49:50.520 --> 49:53.280
 And Edwin Meese put him up with this agent Jacobson.

49:53.280 --> 49:54.520
 I believe it was.

49:54.520 --> 49:56.840
 And they went down and got one and a half tons.

49:56.840 --> 49:59.280
 And on the way back, they bellied it in

49:59.280 --> 50:02.360
 and Pablo Escobar and some of the other ones

50:02.360 --> 50:04.120
 on general there in Nicaragua,

50:04.120 --> 50:07.320
 you can see them toting it from one plane to the other

50:07.320 --> 50:11.280
 in the book called The Big Kings of Cocaine.

50:11.280 --> 50:13.160
 It's got a mention of me too.

50:13.160 --> 50:15.600
 And also the other one has a mention of me in it.

50:16.560 --> 50:19.760
 Said I'm in more files for the DEA than Noriega.

50:19.760 --> 50:23.320
 So who was wanting to get rid of Barry?

50:23.320 --> 50:25.840
 Is that, who wanted to get rid of Barry more?

50:25.840 --> 50:28.880
 The cartels or the CIA?

50:28.880 --> 50:29.720
 The cartel.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.680
 But so Barry leaned back and he told me the story.

50:34.680 --> 50:36.760
 And the tears came down between his fingers

50:36.760 --> 50:38.080
 as he put his hands over his eyes.

50:38.080 --> 50:40.400
 And he said, I just couldn't do it, Roger.

50:40.400 --> 50:42.520
 I just couldn't do three life sentences.

50:42.520 --> 50:43.440
 So I've told him everything.

50:43.440 --> 50:46.240
 I went to Congress and I've testified before Congress.

50:46.240 --> 50:47.520
 He testified before Congress

50:47.520 --> 50:49.320
 for all these things that he had done.

50:49.320 --> 50:52.120
 And he said, I told him all about you,

50:52.120 --> 50:54.240
 but you're under my umbrella.

50:54.240 --> 50:57.360
 You got to testify with me before grand jury in Miami.

50:58.480 --> 51:00.120
 And so the guy said, you can come down,

51:00.120 --> 51:03.040
 the DEA said you can come down tomorrow with Mari,

51:03.040 --> 51:05.960
 first class, or I'll take you down in chains.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.880
 And if you don't testify with Barry,

51:09.880 --> 51:12.440
 the only place you'll ever see your wife and family again

51:12.440 --> 51:14.400
 is in a federal prison visiting room.

51:14.400 --> 51:16.120
 Was that a difficult conversation?

51:16.120 --> 51:19.240
 Oh, my guts was just like ice water.

51:19.240 --> 51:22.320
 I can't testify against my friends.

51:22.320 --> 51:23.800
 I just can't do it.

51:23.800 --> 51:25.000
 How am I going to do it?

51:25.000 --> 51:27.080
 I just, I can't work with people.

51:27.080 --> 51:28.080
 And he was honest with me.

51:28.080 --> 51:29.680
 How am I going to testify against them?

51:29.680 --> 51:32.480
 I can't spend the rest of my life in a federal prison.

51:32.480 --> 51:35.560
 What on earth, what a mess, Barry, you've got me into.

51:36.920 --> 51:37.800
 So.

51:37.800 --> 51:40.120
 Is that a kind of betrayal there?

51:40.120 --> 51:42.960
 Yes, but it's still, I wish he left me out of it.

51:42.960 --> 51:47.960
 I understand him getting in such a mess that he told,

51:49.360 --> 51:52.280
 because if the CIA and whoever else was behind him

51:52.280 --> 51:54.920
 betrayed him, then he's going to tell everything.

51:54.920 --> 51:56.520
 So I says, all right, I'll be in Miami.

51:56.520 --> 52:00.040
 So Mari and I flew down first class.

52:00.040 --> 52:01.600
 And I went to a lawyer,

52:01.600 --> 52:02.920
 one of the biggest lawyers in Miami.

52:02.920 --> 52:05.160
 And I said, man, I am in a mess.

52:06.160 --> 52:09.520
 This fellow's told everything and I've got to say something,

52:09.520 --> 52:10.840
 but I'm not a snitch, man.

52:10.840 --> 52:13.960
 I mean, what can I do?

52:13.960 --> 52:16.240
 And he said, well, being a snitch is like being pregnant.

52:16.240 --> 52:17.640
 You either are or you're not.

52:22.720 --> 52:24.760
 And he says, I don't represent snitches,

52:24.760 --> 52:26.000
 but if you want to fight this case,

52:26.000 --> 52:28.520
 I'll do it for $600,000.

52:28.520 --> 52:29.960
 And boy, my face turned red.

52:29.960 --> 52:31.280
 Well, I'm not a snitch.

52:31.280 --> 52:32.840
 He said, well, that's what you're talking about.

52:32.840 --> 52:33.720
 He said, let me tell you something.

52:33.720 --> 52:36.760
 If you go in there and say one thing and sign that paper

52:36.760 --> 52:40.200
 and you don't tell them everything you know,

52:40.200 --> 52:42.440
 then they will convict you of everything you've ever done

52:42.440 --> 52:43.440
 and you tell them.

52:43.440 --> 52:45.440
 So you can't do it.

52:45.440 --> 52:49.120
 So I said, Barry, I'm having trouble with a lawyer.

52:49.120 --> 52:51.200
 Give it, I'll go to Mari, let's go.

52:51.200 --> 52:52.600
 He said, all right, use my lawyer.

52:52.600 --> 52:54.280
 And he gave me his card, the lawyer's card.

52:54.280 --> 52:58.040
 So Mari and I went to the festival restaurant that night

52:58.040 --> 52:59.520
 and Barry and Debbie came in.

52:59.520 --> 53:01.560
 She was dressed pretty and Barry wasn't.

53:01.560 --> 53:02.720
 So we was already about finished.

53:02.720 --> 53:04.320
 So we had dessert together.

53:04.320 --> 53:06.640
 And I said, Barry, they're going to kill you, friend.

53:06.640 --> 53:08.040
 He said, no, they ain't going to kill me.

53:08.040 --> 53:10.160
 So and so, such and such is gone.

53:10.160 --> 53:11.440
 And this and the other.

53:11.440 --> 53:13.800
 I said, Barry, they're going to kill you, man.

53:13.800 --> 53:15.960
 You can't deny it.

53:15.960 --> 53:19.520
 And I said, I didn't tell him I wasn't going to testify.

53:19.520 --> 53:21.720
 So I hugged his neck.

53:21.720 --> 53:24.000
 I really, like, and we fled to Brazil.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.040
 But I took Mari and the children and went to Brazil.

53:26.040 --> 53:27.560
 So you decided there you're not going to stay.

53:27.560 --> 53:30.960
 I knew, I didn't know what I could do.

53:30.960 --> 53:31.800
 I talked to a lawyer.

53:31.800 --> 53:34.160
 I mean, I just didn't, I didn't know what I could do,

53:34.160 --> 53:37.800
 but the best in Miami said what he told me.

53:37.800 --> 53:39.600
 So I had to go.

53:39.600 --> 53:40.720
 And you went to Brazil.

53:40.720 --> 53:41.560
 We went to Brazil.

53:41.560 --> 53:44.760
 Did you have a conversation with anybody at the cartel?

53:44.760 --> 53:48.000
 I mean, that's such an interesting moment

53:48.000 --> 53:53.000
 that tests the man's character to not snitch.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.240
 And did you have a conversation with anybody?

53:57.240 --> 53:59.200
 No. Pablo with, about it.

53:59.200 --> 54:00.600
 Not at all.

54:00.600 --> 54:02.240
 So it's just understood.

54:02.240 --> 54:04.360
 I just didn't, couldn't do it.

54:04.360 --> 54:06.400
 But how many men like you are there?

54:06.400 --> 54:07.240
 Not many.

54:07.240 --> 54:09.480
 I had all my friends testified against me.

54:09.480 --> 54:11.440
 I had 11 friends and every one of them put their finger up.

54:11.440 --> 54:12.680
 Roger did it.

54:12.680 --> 54:14.040
 And I was facing life,

54:14.040 --> 54:15.480
 continuing criminal enterprise care.

54:15.480 --> 54:16.560
 And still you couldn't do it.

54:16.560 --> 54:18.480
 I just couldn't do it.

54:18.480 --> 54:21.800
 Did you ever get respect from the cartels for that,

54:21.800 --> 54:22.640
 from the people in the cartel?

54:22.640 --> 54:24.600
 Oh, there was a whole time I got back and stuff.

54:24.600 --> 54:26.960
 They owe me money and I can't get it.

54:26.960 --> 54:27.800
 So.

54:27.800 --> 54:29.080
 Well, that's about money.

54:29.080 --> 54:31.080
 I just mean about human beings.

54:31.080 --> 54:31.920
 Oh, I think so.

54:31.920 --> 54:34.560
 I mean, I've been back down there and I've been welcomed.

54:34.560 --> 54:36.840
 I have my contact.

54:36.840 --> 54:38.400
 And when I was in Brazil,

54:38.400 --> 54:39.440
 I was trying to get this money.

54:39.440 --> 54:41.320
 They owe me three and a half million dollars.

54:41.320 --> 54:43.120
 So I called up there and he was going to pay me.

54:43.120 --> 54:47.040
 Oh, I got 600,000 today and I'll get you some more tomorrow.

54:47.040 --> 54:48.680
 And then the next week I called,

54:48.680 --> 54:51.200
 hey, hey, got great news, great news.

54:51.200 --> 54:52.680
 Barry Seale has been killed.

54:53.880 --> 54:55.160
 So, oh no.

54:55.160 --> 54:56.200
 And I went back to the hotel.

54:56.200 --> 54:59.280
 We was up in the northern part of Brazil

54:59.280 --> 55:00.680
 and where was it, Marty?

55:00.680 --> 55:02.120
 It's been quite a job.

55:02.120 --> 55:03.000
 Yeah.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.920
 And so I went back and I told Mary and Miriam

55:05.920 --> 55:08.080
 and they cried and I cried.

55:08.080 --> 55:08.920
 I really cried.

55:08.920 --> 55:12.000
 How is that great news from the cartel perspective?

55:12.000 --> 55:15.440
 Well, now there's no case against me and him and them.

55:15.440 --> 55:16.760
 Do you know who killed them?

55:16.760 --> 55:17.600
 Yes.

55:17.600 --> 55:19.160
 I'll tell you about that story.

55:20.080 --> 55:21.800
 On the first load I did,

55:21.800 --> 55:25.600
 I landed at a banana plantation and it was raining

55:25.600 --> 55:28.000
 and it was a muddy strip, clay.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.320
 And they put the 300 kilos of cocaine

55:30.320 --> 55:32.120
 and then the ugliest man you could imagine,

55:32.120 --> 55:34.680
 named Ronaldo got in there with a Mac 10

55:34.680 --> 55:38.440
 and he was making sure I took it to Louisiana.

55:38.440 --> 55:39.280
 So.

55:39.280 --> 55:40.480
 This is many years before.

55:40.480 --> 55:42.160
 Yeah, a couple of years before.

55:42.160 --> 55:43.000
 So anyway,

55:45.240 --> 55:48.560
 we took off and the mud got up in the wheel well

55:48.560 --> 55:51.600
 so thick until the wheels wouldn't come up.

55:51.600 --> 55:53.200
 Well, I'm going 200 miles an hour

55:53.200 --> 55:55.720
 instead of 300 miles an hour with wheels coming down.

55:55.720 --> 55:57.760
 Well, I can't go back there.

55:57.760 --> 55:59.840
 If I do, I'm gonna be in the same situation

55:59.840 --> 56:02.640
 until the sun dries it out in a few days.

56:02.640 --> 56:05.000
 And so, but in Belize, I had a runway

56:05.000 --> 56:08.560
 that had been used for $10,000 used to refuel.

56:08.560 --> 56:10.080
 So I told the guy, listen,

56:10.080 --> 56:12.480
 we got to land in Belize to refuel.

56:12.480 --> 56:16.080
 No, no, no, we put the Mac 10 and I'll shoot you.

56:16.080 --> 56:17.640
 Go ahead, fool, you're gonna die too.

56:17.640 --> 56:19.640
 So it was in a term.

56:19.640 --> 56:20.480
 So.

56:20.480 --> 56:22.040
 He wasn't just ugly, he was also angry.

56:22.040 --> 56:24.800
 He was a bad, bad killer.

56:24.800 --> 56:28.040
 And so he's the one to actually kill Barry.

56:28.040 --> 56:32.360
 The one that went up on the first load with me.

56:33.360 --> 56:36.240
 And Ronaldo, and he's doing life.

56:36.240 --> 56:37.240
 He's just a killer.

56:37.240 --> 56:39.960
 Yeah, he's doing life in Louisiana.

56:39.960 --> 56:44.640
 I wonder who, is it known who made that decision?

56:44.640 --> 56:48.640
 The younger Ochoa brother, I understand, Fabio,

56:48.640 --> 56:50.840
 which one paid for the hit.

56:50.840 --> 56:52.200
 I don't know that, but that's what I've heard

56:52.200 --> 56:54.040
 and it probably sounds about right.

56:54.040 --> 56:58.520
 He's done in Jessup, Georgia, doing a long, long time.

56:58.520 --> 56:59.360
 I think he's about to get out.

56:59.360 --> 57:01.480
 He's been in 30 years or whatever.

57:03.360 --> 57:04.920
 The movie American Made.

57:07.280 --> 57:09.280
 What do you think that movie got right?

57:09.280 --> 57:11.200
 What did it get wrong?

57:11.200 --> 57:12.440
 Almost everything wrong.

57:14.360 --> 57:16.040
 It was disgustingly wrong.

57:17.800 --> 57:19.960
 Okay, which parts?

57:19.960 --> 57:23.400
 Can you maybe elaborate?

57:23.400 --> 57:26.080
 It's about Barry Seal and it just didn't even,

57:26.080 --> 57:28.760
 it was nothing, whoever wrote it had no idea

57:28.760 --> 57:30.080
 who Barry Seal was.

57:30.080 --> 57:32.120
 They sat in a rocking chair and just tried to think of

57:32.120 --> 57:37.120
 what was some baby bashing drug dealer doing.

57:37.320 --> 57:40.600
 And it's just like, God, you just don't have any idea

57:40.600 --> 57:42.720
 of the spirit of the man.

57:42.720 --> 57:45.040
 So they wanted just to try to tell a fun story

57:45.040 --> 57:47.960
 without actually studying the story.

57:47.960 --> 57:50.040
 They didn't know him, they just had no idea.

57:50.040 --> 57:51.640
 And Barry was such a nice person,

57:51.640 --> 57:54.160
 such a really nice gentleman person.

57:54.160 --> 57:55.840
 They talked to you or no?

57:55.840 --> 57:56.680
 No.

57:56.680 --> 57:57.960
 The people that made the movie.

57:57.960 --> 58:01.720
 And I see all these people telling Barry never met him.

58:01.720 --> 58:02.960
 They telling all about him.

58:02.960 --> 58:05.200
 I think that's just ridiculous.

58:05.200 --> 58:08.000
 And for one thing, for his character coming out

58:08.000 --> 58:10.760
 of warehouses and all that, that was just like ugly.

58:10.760 --> 58:14.360
 And then down in Columbia, putting a gun to his head,

58:14.360 --> 58:17.640
 going to take his sunglasses and then he put $25,000

58:17.640 --> 58:19.840
 million worth of cocaine on his plane.

58:19.840 --> 58:21.080
 And then they're going to bet $100

58:21.080 --> 58:22.920
 he don't have enough room to take off.

58:24.800 --> 58:26.200
 That's just insane.

58:26.200 --> 58:28.680
 I mean, just the whole thing.

58:28.680 --> 58:31.720
 And then he's talking to the DEA agents when he's coming up.

58:31.720 --> 58:34.280
 You don't know what frequency they own,

58:34.280 --> 58:36.200
 how he's got five planes and they all split

58:36.200 --> 58:37.760
 when the DEA comes out.

58:37.760 --> 58:41.080
 These are just somebody just fantasy.

58:41.080 --> 58:43.120
 But those are like, those are details of the man,

58:43.120 --> 58:44.760
 details of the story.

58:44.760 --> 58:47.720
 Is there some big profound things they missed

58:47.720 --> 58:50.440
 about just this whole period?

58:50.440 --> 58:53.280
 But that's something that's really important to you

58:53.280 --> 58:55.000
 that was missed.

58:55.000 --> 58:59.000
 Yes, they just tried to sensationalize

58:59.000 --> 59:00.720
 on little things that people remember.

59:00.720 --> 59:01.840
 And it's just not true.

59:01.840 --> 59:06.240
 It was just like a business deal and good people

59:06.240 --> 59:08.960
 and good airplanes and good flying.

59:08.960 --> 59:13.960
 And it was like a good watch that was made.

59:14.240 --> 59:16.640
 It just clicked and it just went on.

59:16.640 --> 59:17.920
 And they missed all of that.

59:17.920 --> 59:20.920
 They tried to make it sound like it's something very ugly.

59:20.920 --> 59:21.840
 Do you think it was a story

59:21.840 --> 59:23.200
 that could have been told way better

59:23.200 --> 59:24.720
 and still be a hell of a good story?

59:24.720 --> 59:26.560
 Oh my goodness, yes.

59:26.560 --> 59:31.560
 Well, there's a series called Chernobyl done by HBO.

59:31.760 --> 59:35.040
 And because I have sort of family connected to that period,

59:36.640 --> 59:40.160
 they did an incredible job of being historically accurate

59:40.160 --> 59:42.280
 and only not being historically accurate

59:42.280 --> 59:45.280
 when it helped the story, only in those rare cases.

59:45.280 --> 59:47.760
 When they on purpose left the story

59:47.760 --> 59:51.240
 to make it easier for people to understand.

59:51.240 --> 59:54.280
 But it was still somehow accurate.

59:54.280 --> 59:57.600
 And even though all the actors were British actors

59:57.600 --> 1:00:00.040
 speaking English with a British accent,

1:00:00.040 --> 1:00:02.400
 it was still somehow accurate.

1:00:02.400 --> 1:00:05.520
 Like they captured the spirit.

1:00:05.520 --> 1:00:06.960
 So it was historically accurate

1:00:06.960 --> 1:00:08.360
 and the spirit was captured.

1:00:08.360 --> 1:00:10.720
 That was one of the most incredible like series

1:00:10.720 --> 1:00:11.720
 I've ever seen.

1:00:11.720 --> 1:00:16.720
 It convinced me that the movie was made by non Russians.

1:00:17.440 --> 1:00:21.640
 It convinced me that if you really care about a story,

1:00:21.640 --> 1:00:23.440
 you don't have to have been brought up in it.

1:00:23.440 --> 1:00:25.320
 You don't even need to speak the language.

1:00:25.320 --> 1:00:27.320
 If you're truly a scholar of it,

1:00:27.320 --> 1:00:29.720
 if you talk to a lot of people, if you learn,

1:00:29.720 --> 1:00:32.760
 if you just pour your heart and soul into it,

1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:34.640
 you can create something really special.

1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:37.920
 And so your son says you could do that with the story

1:00:37.920 --> 1:00:39.320
 with this period of time.

1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:43.360
 Oh yes, it was a story that needs to be told.

1:00:43.360 --> 1:00:45.040
 It need to be told in the correct way.

1:00:45.040 --> 1:00:49.480
 Not like we're trying to bash a certain angle.

1:00:49.480 --> 1:00:50.400
 Yeah.

1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:52.800
 Well, if Netflix or HBO are watching this,

1:00:52.800 --> 1:00:56.520
 you need to tell the story of Roger Rees, in my opinion.

1:00:56.520 --> 1:00:57.480
 There you go.

1:00:57.480 --> 1:00:59.080
 This is a young picture of you.

1:00:59.080 --> 1:00:59.920
 Yeah. There you go.

1:00:59.920 --> 1:01:01.360
 That's from National Geographic.

1:01:01.360 --> 1:01:05.960
 Jorge Archoa, Pablo Escobar, it's you, Roger and Barry.

1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:06.800
 Yeah.

1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:09.760
 And the Muggler, a memoir.

1:01:09.760 --> 1:01:13.280
 Yeah, I really do hope that they make a movie of this one.

1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:17.480
 There's a movie called Blow that tells the story

1:01:17.480 --> 1:01:19.880
 of George Young, Boston George.

1:01:19.880 --> 1:01:22.000
 Did you know George Young?

1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:23.280
 That's one way to ask it.

1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:25.640
 The other is what do you think of the movie Blow?

1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:29.240
 I didn't know George Young, but it was a wonderful movie.

1:01:29.240 --> 1:01:30.640
 Absolutely.

1:01:30.640 --> 1:01:31.800
 It captured it.

1:01:31.800 --> 1:01:32.640
 It did.

1:01:32.640 --> 1:01:33.480
 Yes, it did.

1:01:33.480 --> 1:01:34.600
 That's the way it should be.

1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:36.360
 So he was a little bit before your time?

1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:37.800
 Exactly the same time.

1:01:37.800 --> 1:01:38.800
 Exactly the same time.

1:01:38.800 --> 1:01:41.720
 He was using stewardesses to fly the marijuana

1:01:41.720 --> 1:01:43.800
 out of Manhattan Beach,

1:01:43.800 --> 1:01:46.160
 and I was on the fire department in Redondo Beach,

1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:49.560
 10 miles away, flying it up, sending it back.

1:01:49.560 --> 1:01:50.560
 Somebody was sending it back.

1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:52.960
 He might've been sending it back,

1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:55.720
 but he didn't have near the excitement that I did.

1:01:55.720 --> 1:01:57.840
 I was shot down twice.

1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:00.200
 I escaped from five different prisons.

1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:02.160
 I was tortured almost to death in a Mexican prison.

1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:04.080
 So he didn't have all that fun that I had.

1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:05.040
 Fun in quotes.

1:02:05.040 --> 1:02:09.120
 Yeah, so yours is a heck of a fun adventure.

1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:10.720
 Just to linger on a little bit.

1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:14.440
 So Johnny Depp plays George,

1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:16.640
 and Ray Liotta plays his father,

1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:20.760
 and there's this son father kind of scene at the end.

1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:23.600
 I don't know.

1:02:24.640 --> 1:02:26.480
 It's heartbreaking.

1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:29.840
 Like that scene paints a picture of a life

1:02:29.840 --> 1:02:34.840
 that could have been had if none of this wild drug

1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:37.400
 smuggling happened.

1:02:38.840 --> 1:02:42.520
 I don't usually, I mean, I don't, I'm almost,

1:02:42.520 --> 1:02:46.920
 I really never get like teary eyed in a movie,

1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:49.000
 but that got me.

1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.160
 It's almost like confronting at the end of your life

1:02:53.160 --> 1:02:56.160
 what your life could have been with your father,

1:02:56.160 --> 1:02:57.640
 the way he calls him Georgie.

1:02:57.640 --> 1:03:02.640
 It, like you fucked up, Georgie.

1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:05.320
 Yes, I did too.

1:03:05.320 --> 1:03:07.120
 I really, really did.

1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:08.880
 Mario waited for me all those years

1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:11.120
 and the children raised them without me,

1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:13.640
 visiting me in prisons all over the world.

1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:14.720
 It's unbelievable.

1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:17.280
 It's just, nothing's worth that kind of money.

1:03:17.280 --> 1:03:18.120
 Yeah.

1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:24.440
 Can you tell the story of when you were tortured

1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:27.080
 nearly to death in a Mexican prison?

1:03:27.080 --> 1:03:28.880
 I sure can and I'm smiling,

1:03:28.880 --> 1:03:32.120
 but it was nothing to smile about, I can tell you.

1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:35.680
 I was in a pool and a gentleman came over

1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:37.840
 and shook hands with me and put handcuffs on me.

1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:39.280
 And I thought, what in the world?

1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:41.160
 That was at one of the nice hotels.

1:03:41.160 --> 1:03:45.120
 They put me in a jail cell and I sat there

1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:48.200
 and all the drunks and thieves and stuff kept coming in

1:03:48.200 --> 1:03:50.800
 and they had a bucket and it overrun.

1:03:50.800 --> 1:03:53.000
 And I said, I remember like 18 people in a room

1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.120
 about 12 foot square.

1:03:55.120 --> 1:03:56.800
 Oh, it was hot and I thought,

1:03:56.800 --> 1:04:00.040
 somebody's gotta come get me, this ain't real.

1:04:00.040 --> 1:04:01.360
 I hadn't done anything.

1:04:01.360 --> 1:04:05.160
 It's like, it was a pilot come to see me up in Hermosillo

1:04:05.160 --> 1:04:06.920
 and he stopped and he made a mistake

1:04:06.920 --> 1:04:08.160
 and went to the International Runway

1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:09.960
 instead of where he was supposed to go.

1:04:09.960 --> 1:04:13.880
 And he had my phony name in his pocket, so they got me.

1:04:15.160 --> 1:04:17.880
 So they said I was a drug smuggler.

1:04:17.880 --> 1:04:21.040
 So after about three days, they put me back into the back

1:04:21.040 --> 1:04:23.360
 and it was a torture place.

1:04:23.360 --> 1:04:25.160
 And they put me in a little cell like,

1:04:25.160 --> 1:04:27.000
 I guess it wasn't hard even, it wasn't six feet,

1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:30.240
 must've been about five feet square and about 12 feet high.

1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:34.600
 And it was June, the end of June, and it was hot.

1:04:34.600 --> 1:04:36.560
 I mean hot.

1:04:36.560 --> 1:04:40.520
 And they left me in there for, I guess a few days.

1:04:40.520 --> 1:04:43.440
 You didn't know, so every once in a while

1:04:43.440 --> 1:04:45.880
 they'd come drag me out and first off,

1:04:45.880 --> 1:04:47.520
 they put my head under water

1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:49.680
 and it had seltzer in it or some kind.

1:04:49.680 --> 1:04:52.080
 And I took one whiff of that and three or four of them

1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:53.640
 couldn't hold me down.

1:04:53.640 --> 1:04:56.880
 So then I learned that just before you have to breathe,

1:04:56.880 --> 1:04:59.040
 tear loose like that and they'll let you up.

1:05:00.440 --> 1:05:02.200
 And that was the first treatment.

1:05:02.200 --> 1:05:03.960
 And then they started beating me.

1:05:03.960 --> 1:05:06.320
 And they beat me with a blackjack and rubber hose

1:05:06.320 --> 1:05:08.080
 until I was black and blue and yellow

1:05:08.080 --> 1:05:10.200
 from the bottom of my feet to my head.

1:05:10.200 --> 1:05:11.040
 What did they want from you?

1:05:11.040 --> 1:05:12.920
 They wanted me to sign a confession

1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:14.960
 that I was a drug smuggler.

1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:17.720
 And they put the papers under your nose.

1:05:17.720 --> 1:05:19.000
 This is all over if you'll sign.

1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:21.400
 Well, I knew if you signed, you got six years.

1:05:21.400 --> 1:05:25.400
 I wasn't gonna sign, I wasn't gonna sign.

1:05:25.400 --> 1:05:27.760
 But they didn't want you to snitch on anybody.

1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:28.600
 They just wanted you to say.

1:05:28.600 --> 1:05:29.800
 No, they just wanted me to sign that paper.

1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:30.640
 And you still didn't.

1:05:30.640 --> 1:05:32.760
 I didn't even bow to it.

1:05:32.760 --> 1:05:34.800
 I ain't a beat and ate that bad.

1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:35.640
 So.

1:05:35.640 --> 1:05:40.640
 So anyhow, it just got them into the good part.

1:05:40.640 --> 1:05:42.920
 So then they come and they take me out,

1:05:42.920 --> 1:05:44.800
 I'm bug naked and they bend me over

1:05:44.800 --> 1:05:45.920
 and they have things to pull you,

1:05:45.920 --> 1:05:47.560
 like chains click, click, click, click, click.

1:05:47.560 --> 1:05:50.560
 And they bent me over and they put butter

1:05:50.560 --> 1:05:55.320
 on my bum and they commenced to put hot chili pepper

1:05:55.320 --> 1:05:57.640
 up there and that stuff was bad.

1:05:57.640 --> 1:06:02.640
 I mean, it was red hot and that was, that was awful.

1:06:05.880 --> 1:06:06.720
 And still.

1:06:06.720 --> 1:06:07.960
 That was just awful.

1:06:07.960 --> 1:06:09.160
 Yeah, but still you didn't.

1:06:09.160 --> 1:06:10.120
 I didn't think about it.

1:06:10.120 --> 1:06:12.840
 I ain't going to, I guess if I'd have known

1:06:12.840 --> 1:06:14.080
 he was gonna kill me, I wouldn't have done it.

1:06:14.080 --> 1:06:18.320
 But I wasn't about, you get hurt bad enough

1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:20.680
 you'll pass out, so I didn't pass out.

1:06:20.680 --> 1:06:22.480
 So I was all right.

1:06:22.480 --> 1:06:25.120
 So then the last thing they did was

1:06:25.120 --> 1:06:27.840
 they brought a dead man in there and he was wrapped.

1:06:27.840 --> 1:06:28.680
 He was frozen.

1:06:28.680 --> 1:06:30.400
 He was wrapped in newspaper, little strips

1:06:30.400 --> 1:06:33.000
 about a half inch wide, just like a mummy.

1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:35.200
 And he was frozen and they hung him on the wall

1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:40.200
 with a meat hook and you next son of a bitch, you next.

1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:43.120
 And so he's sitting there like this

1:06:43.120 --> 1:06:46.440
 and as he starts to throw out, which is pretty quick,

1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:50.120
 it looks like he's crying and it looks like he's peeing

1:06:50.120 --> 1:06:52.600
 and the paper starts unraveling on him

1:06:52.600 --> 1:06:55.360
 and the formaldehyde puddles on the floor.

1:06:55.360 --> 1:06:58.920
 Ooh, what a smell that rotten insides

1:06:58.920 --> 1:07:02.280
 and the formaldehyde and there was a little space.

1:07:02.280 --> 1:07:04.280
 It wasn't even a half inch high under the door.

1:07:04.280 --> 1:07:06.560
 And I lay on that filthy floor with my cheek

1:07:06.560 --> 1:07:08.160
 and put my lips right up under that door

1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:09.320
 and we're sucking that fresh air.

1:07:09.320 --> 1:07:11.280
 And I went to sleep after some time.

1:07:11.280 --> 1:07:14.640
 And I know where Walt Disney gets his ideas.

1:07:14.640 --> 1:07:18.240
 I saw white pink pigs with wings on them,

1:07:18.240 --> 1:07:20.720
 all kinds of stuff flying around.

1:07:20.720 --> 1:07:22.840
 So when I woke up, I didn't know which was real

1:07:22.840 --> 1:07:24.560
 and which was the nightmare.

1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:27.480
 It took me a minute to figure out where I was

1:07:27.480 --> 1:07:29.400
 and what was going on.

1:07:29.400 --> 1:07:33.960
 How did you stay mentally strong through that time?

1:07:33.960 --> 1:07:34.800
 Like what?

1:07:34.800 --> 1:07:35.640
 I don't know that I did.

1:07:35.640 --> 1:07:37.920
 I was, yeah, I was mentally strong.

1:07:37.920 --> 1:07:39.320
 So I was just like I am now.

1:07:39.320 --> 1:07:40.160
 Stubborn.

1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:43.000
 I mean, you could be that man that could have killed you.

1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:44.200
 Yes, I could have.

1:07:44.200 --> 1:07:46.240
 So what gave you hope?

1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:47.320
 Did you have hope?

1:07:47.320 --> 1:07:48.160
 Yeah.

1:07:48.160 --> 1:07:49.720
 Or you were just a stubborn son of a bitch?

1:07:49.720 --> 1:07:50.920
 I think some of both of it.

1:07:50.920 --> 1:07:53.440
 And I think they aren't going to keep you here forever.

1:07:53.440 --> 1:07:54.920
 You know, you're going to get out into the prison

1:07:54.920 --> 1:07:56.160
 or they're going to let you go or something.

1:07:56.160 --> 1:07:58.440
 If you sign that paper, you ain't going nowhere.

1:07:58.440 --> 1:07:59.640
 And I want to go home.

1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:05.240
 I got shot down a few weeks before that.

1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:07.040
 I got shot from out of the sky.

1:08:07.040 --> 1:08:08.680
 80 bullet holes through the plane,

1:08:08.680 --> 1:08:09.960
 killed a fellow on the ground,

1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:12.880
 shot the leg nearly off the man in the plane.

1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:13.720
 Where was this?

1:08:13.720 --> 1:08:15.160
 In that little place of Peachy Lingy.

1:08:15.160 --> 1:08:16.000
 You want to tell you that story?

1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:16.840
 And they were shooting you from the ground.

1:08:16.840 --> 1:08:17.680
 Yeah, yeah.

1:08:17.680 --> 1:08:18.520
 All right.

1:08:18.520 --> 1:08:20.560
 A little 900 foot strip there at Peachy Lingy,

1:08:20.560 --> 1:08:23.000
 a poor, poor village with starving donkeys.

1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:24.080
 And that's where they'd,

1:08:24.080 --> 1:08:26.200
 I'd give them $17,000 for the load.

1:08:26.200 --> 1:08:27.880
 And I'd go over on the highway and load.

1:08:27.880 --> 1:08:31.120
 Well, on day 13, I did a load every day for 13 days.

1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:33.480
 They had a bunch of marijuana, pretty good piled up.

1:08:33.480 --> 1:08:35.320
 And I was going low today.

1:08:35.320 --> 1:08:39.120
 And on day 13, I had that little warning sign

1:08:39.120 --> 1:08:40.240
 going off in my stomach.

1:08:40.240 --> 1:08:42.800
 Uh oh, uh oh, don't do it.

1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:45.200
 But I asked this Joaquin,

1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:47.040
 oh, we had the federal, all this paid off,

1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:47.880
 nowhere we were.

1:08:47.880 --> 1:08:49.800
 So I spent the night in a hammock

1:08:49.800 --> 1:08:52.720
 and walked down to the airplane,

1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:54.440
 just as it get in daylight.

1:08:54.440 --> 1:08:57.400
 And 10 or 12 men walked with me and Pedro got in.

1:08:57.400 --> 1:08:58.920
 I brushed my teeth in the little stream.

1:08:58.920 --> 1:09:00.400
 It was about foot deep,

1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:02.440
 a little river coming through there.

1:09:02.440 --> 1:09:05.400
 And got in the airplane and I fired her up.

1:09:05.400 --> 1:09:06.440
 Bam, blah, blah.

1:09:06.440 --> 1:09:09.640
 And bam, I thought a tire blew out.

1:09:09.640 --> 1:09:14.200
 I looked over and it still ain't dawned on me.

1:09:14.200 --> 1:09:16.880
 And Pedro was yelling, police here, police here Roger,

1:09:16.880 --> 1:09:17.720
 police here.

1:09:17.720 --> 1:09:19.520
 Well, it dawned on me.

1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:23.360
 And I shoved it, the throttle to the firewall.

1:09:23.360 --> 1:09:24.200
 And I only had about.

1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:25.880
 So that was a bullet.

1:09:25.880 --> 1:09:28.440
 Yeah, somebody, there's officer sides, they'd shot.

1:09:28.440 --> 1:09:31.120
 They'd shot just a warning, like get out, stop.

1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:33.360
 We're gonna rob you, whatever it is.

1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:34.720
 That's what they do.

1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:35.880
 They just taking the plane and me

1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:37.280
 and put me in prison, old thing.

1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:39.760
 So, but I, even though I had papers.

1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:41.720
 So I just shoved it to the firewall

1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:43.920
 and there wasn't enough room to take off on that strip.

1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:46.080
 And there's half of it was behind me

1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:47.640
 or some of it was behind me.

1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:49.720
 And so just at the end, I'm just like,

1:09:49.720 --> 1:09:51.880
 I think that thing stalls at about 50 miles an hour.

1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:55.760
 Just turning 50 and I just pulled it right up

1:09:55.760 --> 1:09:57.560
 and put the flaps on.

1:09:57.560 --> 1:09:59.720
 And as I pulled off the ground,

1:09:59.720 --> 1:10:02.200
 they opened up on both sides of me with machine guns

1:10:02.200 --> 1:10:03.800
 and they riddled that airplane.

1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:06.600
 I mean, the windshield came out.

1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:08.120
 I got hit three times.

1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:10.400
 You, like your body?

1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:11.280
 Yeah.

1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:14.520
 And I didn't know I was hit.

1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:17.840
 I mean, it was just the gasoline just pouring in.

1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:18.920
 The world turned yellow.

1:10:18.920 --> 1:10:20.680
 I must've went into shock.

1:10:20.680 --> 1:10:23.480
 So it just stopped in slow motion.

1:10:23.480 --> 1:10:26.720
 And one bullet hit the strut right by my head.

1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:30.920
 And it just, parts of that bullet just went all over me.

1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:35.320
 I just looked like I'd been peppered with lead.

1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:37.560
 And the gasoline was just pouring in.

1:10:37.560 --> 1:10:40.200
 I mean, just pouring in where they'd shot the wing up above

1:10:40.200 --> 1:10:41.840
 and the windshield's gone.

1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:46.080
 I mean, it was just like a hail storm.

1:10:47.160 --> 1:10:48.440
 So I was...

1:10:48.440 --> 1:10:50.760
 Airplanes did stall or no?

1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:53.120
 I was in a stall anyway, and I didn't realize it.

1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:55.320
 And I guess you wouldn't unless you trained for it.

1:10:55.320 --> 1:10:56.720
 But when you're in a stall,

1:10:56.720 --> 1:10:59.840
 the elevator is kind of flappy.

1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:01.280
 And I didn't realize it at the time.

1:11:01.280 --> 1:11:04.040
 I thought they had shot the elevator cable in too.

1:11:04.040 --> 1:11:05.120
 So I thought, oh God.

1:11:05.120 --> 1:11:07.160
 So I just reached over and switched it off,

1:11:07.160 --> 1:11:09.840
 switched the mixture, pulled everything.

1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:12.600
 And in the river, there was rocks

1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:14.400
 about as big as this table.

1:11:14.400 --> 1:11:16.200
 And they were like the turtle back

1:11:16.200 --> 1:11:17.840
 all the way up until there was a waterfall.

1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:19.640
 There's quite a pretty place.

1:11:19.640 --> 1:11:21.280
 And I crashed straight onto it.

1:11:21.280 --> 1:11:22.960
 I thought if I get those rocks.

1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:25.680
 And when I did the first time I hit, the wings came off

1:11:25.680 --> 1:11:26.560
 and then it bounced.

1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:28.240
 And the next time the nose came up

1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:30.360
 and came under the plane and I'm sitting there,

1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:31.800
 I must've been knocked unconscious

1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:32.800
 called Pedro shaking me.

1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:34.720
 Come on, Roger, come on, Roger.

1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:37.360
 So I stepped out into the water

1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:38.960
 and here comes these four Federalists

1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:40.200
 still shooting at us.

1:11:40.200 --> 1:11:42.800
 And I'm bulleted to hit the airplane.

1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:45.800
 And I kept a nine millimeter Browning high power

1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:49.640
 taped to the top of the radio in case I ever needed it.

1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:53.840
 So, cause you didn't want it in the airplane.

1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:55.320
 So I just, it was just handy just laying there.

1:11:55.320 --> 1:11:57.040
 So I took and popped a few caps out of them

1:11:57.040 --> 1:11:58.560
 and they ran into the rocks.

1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:03.080
 So we took off running.

1:12:03.080 --> 1:12:05.320
 And then I looked and Pedro's foot nearly shot off.

1:12:05.320 --> 1:12:07.160
 They'd shot him on one side of the ankle

1:12:07.160 --> 1:12:08.920
 and it just blown out the other side.

1:12:08.920 --> 1:12:11.720
 And it wasn't even hardly bleeding, the shock of it.

1:12:11.720 --> 1:12:13.760
 So I took my T shirt off and gripped it

1:12:13.760 --> 1:12:15.080
 and tied it best I could.

1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:16.400
 But you had still bullets in you.

1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:17.840
 So like you could still run.

1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:20.120
 I shot the top of my toenail off.

1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:22.560
 I shot it across my head and my kneecap.

1:12:22.560 --> 1:12:23.720
 So I was just nicked.

1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:24.880
 Okay, got it.

1:12:24.880 --> 1:12:26.600
 It was very painful later on,

1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:29.520
 but right that time I didn't, it was just hot.

1:12:29.520 --> 1:12:31.240
 And there's a bullet still in my foot from it,

1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:32.360
 a piece of a bullet.

1:12:32.360 --> 1:12:33.480
 Good size slug.

1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:37.320
 So we went on up the mountain through the cactus

1:12:37.320 --> 1:12:38.440
 and just running.

1:12:38.440 --> 1:12:39.520
 Just going, I want to go down.

1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:42.360
 No, no, the federal is going the easy way.

1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:44.240
 Let's go, this young fella.

1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:45.720
 And we came to an old donkey.

1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:48.760
 She must've been 30 years old, long and way back,

1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:51.680
 long hair on her, Charlotte, Charlotte.

1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:54.040
 And he petted the donkey and we jumped on.

1:12:54.040 --> 1:12:54.880
 And we rode for seven.

1:12:54.880 --> 1:12:55.800
 Like an actual donkey?

1:12:55.800 --> 1:12:56.640
 A donkey.

1:12:56.640 --> 1:12:57.600
 There were donkeys all over the place.

1:12:57.600 --> 1:12:59.680
 Anyhow, he knew that one from the village.

1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:01.720
 And so we rode seven miles, two of us,

1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:04.080
 on a donkey with no bridle, no saddle, nothing.

1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:08.360
 And we came to a little man plowing a little horse

1:13:08.360 --> 1:13:09.560
 and a little ox.

1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:11.720
 Both of them were spotted and the ox was,

1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:13.440
 the yoke was across their back this way.

1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:15.720
 And he was plowing with a little plow among stumps.

1:13:15.720 --> 1:13:17.160
 It was like one of these people clearing

1:13:17.160 --> 1:13:18.240
 a little piece of land.

1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:20.160
 And he had a little house there.

1:13:20.160 --> 1:13:21.400
 And so we went into his house

1:13:21.400 --> 1:13:22.600
 and his wife and his daughter,

1:13:22.600 --> 1:13:26.760
 they put like a cloth over my wounds and on Pedro's.

1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:28.760
 It was terrible.

1:13:28.760 --> 1:13:32.840
 And they poured diesel oil on it to keep the flies off.

1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:34.520
 So I'm covered in diesel.

1:13:34.520 --> 1:13:38.120
 So the man left and he was gone all day.

1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:39.520
 And then about dark, he showed up,

1:13:39.520 --> 1:13:42.320
 maybe about 15 or 20 horses and mules showed up

1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:44.240
 in the yard, walking fast.

1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:45.280
 And a doctor got out, he said,

1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:48.120
 I'm Dr. Benjamin Soso with Red Cross.

1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:50.280
 And he worked on my foot and he worked on Pedro.

1:13:50.280 --> 1:13:53.440
 He gave us a shot of morphine and tetanus shots.

1:13:53.440 --> 1:13:55.400
 And he said, you got to get to hospital.

1:13:55.400 --> 1:13:57.680
 He said, Pedro will die if he don't get to hospital.

1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:00.200
 He said, they are looking for American pilots

1:14:00.200 --> 1:14:02.000
 been shot down and they think he's dead.

1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:04.160
 There was a lot of blood in that airplane.

1:14:04.160 --> 1:14:07.840
 And so they rode, I don't know how far we rode,

1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:09.720
 but we rode miles and we'd come to a road

1:14:09.720 --> 1:14:10.960
 and there was a big truck

1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:12.880
 and it was loaded with corn in the ear.

1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:15.120
 And they dug holes in that corn, put us in it

1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:17.240
 and covered us up.

1:14:17.240 --> 1:14:18.240
 And the road was rough.

1:14:18.240 --> 1:14:20.560
 And every time we'd hit a dirt road,

1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:21.760
 that corn would cover me up.

1:14:21.760 --> 1:14:24.360
 They'd scratch my face out again.

1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:26.600
 And when they came to the highway,

1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:28.680
 we went into a house and they got me some clothes

1:14:28.680 --> 1:14:32.320
 and mine was messed up and a white basin.

1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:35.080
 And they must've brought 20 jugs of water different times.

1:14:35.080 --> 1:14:36.640
 I kept washing and washing my foot

1:14:36.640 --> 1:14:39.080
 till all the blood and the crud got off of me

1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:40.920
 and put on those clothes.

1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:42.840
 And somebody went to, they said,

1:14:42.840 --> 1:14:44.400
 you can't go North, the road's blocked.

1:14:44.400 --> 1:14:45.760
 They're looking for the pilot.

1:14:45.760 --> 1:14:47.080
 So you got to go South.

1:14:47.080 --> 1:14:50.240
 So they found a taxi in Mazatlan.

1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:52.480
 And it was a rather new taxi.

1:14:52.480 --> 1:14:54.600
 And the fellow would take me to Guadalajara,

1:14:54.600 --> 1:14:58.480
 which was, I don't know, seven, eight hours South.

1:14:58.480 --> 1:15:00.160
 So we got in that taxi and they propped me up

1:15:00.160 --> 1:15:03.520
 with sheets and blankets and pillows in the back seat

1:15:03.520 --> 1:15:06.800
 and gave me these great big white pain pills.

1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:08.800
 And I was quite content.

1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:12.240
 Then I was shot down in Columbia also.

1:15:13.320 --> 1:15:14.920
 What, can you tell that story?

1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:15.880
 I sure can.

1:15:17.120 --> 1:15:20.560
 All right, I went down for a load of marijuana

1:15:20.560 --> 1:15:23.920
 and we got to the place and we got there too early.

1:15:23.920 --> 1:15:26.200
 And the guerrillas screamed,

1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:28.160
 you got to get out of here, you got to get out of here.

1:15:28.160 --> 1:15:31.080
 And so we went back to the place where we stayed from

1:15:31.080 --> 1:15:32.320
 and refueled.

1:15:32.320 --> 1:15:36.200
 I had a beautiful DC3, carried three tons.

1:15:36.200 --> 1:15:39.560
 And so while I was waiting,

1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:44.560
 I ate something for lunch and I went around behind the house.

1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:47.680
 We refueled a plane up and I had to wait till late afternoon.

1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:49.400
 They wanted me to come just at dark

1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:54.400
 so the military planes couldn't see me on their strip.

1:15:54.880 --> 1:15:57.440
 So I'm leaning in the hammock asleep

1:15:57.440 --> 1:15:59.080
 and I hear this terrible roar.

1:16:00.320 --> 1:16:02.040
 And I looked right up through the trees

1:16:02.040 --> 1:16:05.240
 and at the end of two military jets going straight up.

1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:09.280
 They do a dive over and they came back down the strip

1:16:09.280 --> 1:16:11.120
 in front of that airplane and they just tear it up

1:16:11.120 --> 1:16:12.880
 with 50 caliber machine guns.

1:16:12.880 --> 1:16:14.920
 They just showing out.

1:16:14.920 --> 1:16:18.440
 So I run for the airplane, I just give that guy $80,000

1:16:18.440 --> 1:16:19.480
 and he ran for the truck

1:16:19.480 --> 1:16:21.160
 and all the rest of them ran for the truck.

1:16:21.160 --> 1:16:22.720
 I should have ran with my money,

1:16:23.680 --> 1:16:25.720
 but I didn't, I ran for the airplane.

1:16:25.720 --> 1:16:28.720
 And the copilot got in and his name was Al.

1:16:28.720 --> 1:16:30.600
 He got in with me and two fellows got in the back.

1:16:30.600 --> 1:16:32.600
 We had drums of fuel in there to refuel

1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:34.560
 when we got down to the guerrillas.

1:16:35.920 --> 1:16:39.680
 So we took off and I couldn't get the gear up

1:16:39.680 --> 1:16:41.280
 because I'd taken off in such a hurry.

1:16:41.280 --> 1:16:45.440
 These pins in the struts of a DC3 and with big flags on them

1:16:45.440 --> 1:16:46.360
 and you have to take them up

1:16:46.360 --> 1:16:49.000
 so that the plane won't come up.

1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:51.640
 So these jets swarmed on me and they tried to get me to go.

1:16:51.640 --> 1:16:53.040
 They kept telling me which way to go

1:16:53.040 --> 1:16:54.800
 and the pilot would be just as close

1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:55.880
 as just right over there.

1:16:55.880 --> 1:16:56.720
 I could see him.

1:16:56.720 --> 1:16:58.440
 I just held up the old iffy piece.

1:16:58.440 --> 1:17:00.320
 I didn't think they would shoot.

1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:02.040
 I really didn't.

1:17:02.040 --> 1:17:03.520
 Nobody had shot before.

1:17:04.480 --> 1:17:07.920
 So I kept flying out and I kept getting slower and slower

1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:09.600
 and they kept slowing down, down, down

1:17:09.600 --> 1:17:11.680
 and the black smoke rolling.

1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:13.960
 And then they started shooting up under me.

1:17:13.960 --> 1:17:16.680
 Boom, boom, boom, boom with them 20 millimeter cannons.

1:17:16.680 --> 1:17:18.480
 And then the tracers just going up.

1:17:18.480 --> 1:17:20.480
 They looked like they're curving up from me.

1:17:20.480 --> 1:17:22.360
 I woo and I pushed the nose over

1:17:22.360 --> 1:17:23.520
 so they couldn't get under me.

1:17:23.520 --> 1:17:26.240
 And later on I heard they thought I tried to ram them.

1:17:27.440 --> 1:17:30.480
 So one of them went for fuel and I kept on going

1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:34.440
 and the one just tore the left wing tip up

1:17:34.440 --> 1:17:35.600
 with the 50 caliber.

1:17:35.600 --> 1:17:38.560
 And then he come back again and shot the tail up.

1:17:38.560 --> 1:17:39.840
 He's warning me.

1:17:39.840 --> 1:17:41.040
 And I tell the feller in there, I says,

1:17:41.040 --> 1:17:42.840
 you know, if you bring me enough water,

1:17:42.840 --> 1:17:44.400
 I believe I can fly this thing.

1:17:44.400 --> 1:17:45.880
 My mouth got quite dry.

1:17:47.680 --> 1:17:52.400
 So I went on and I landed on a big pasture.

1:17:54.600 --> 1:17:57.720
 And it was huge pasture and it was rougher than it looked.

1:17:57.720 --> 1:17:59.720
 And the wings just flapped and I come to a stop

1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:01.880
 and jumped out and pull those tabs out,

1:18:01.880 --> 1:18:04.640
 threw them on the ground so I could get my gear up.

1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:07.440
 And I understand that during the 1980 World Series

1:18:07.440 --> 1:18:10.600
 baseball game that it says American DC three

1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:12.680
 has just been shot down by American jets,

1:18:12.680 --> 1:18:14.200
 by Colombian jets.

1:18:14.200 --> 1:18:15.920
 You know, it's the first plane shot down

1:18:15.920 --> 1:18:17.560
 on Reagan's new war on drugs.

1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:19.560
 But he's up, he's up and away, ladies and gentlemen.

1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:20.800
 We keep you posted.

1:18:20.800 --> 1:18:24.040
 So I took off again and I went into a thunderstorm

1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:26.040
 and they came close to the mountains.

1:18:26.040 --> 1:18:28.520
 So I spiraled up and every time I'd come out,

1:18:28.520 --> 1:18:30.920
 that jet was there, boom, boom, boom.

1:18:30.920 --> 1:18:35.040
 And I'd go back into that storm and boom, boom, boom

1:18:35.040 --> 1:18:37.920
 in there and at 20,000 feet, I started icing up.

1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:40.120
 So I went out one last time and he was right there waiting.

1:18:40.120 --> 1:18:41.320
 He had me on radar.

1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:43.320
 So I went back in and I kicked it over

1:18:43.320 --> 1:18:46.360
 and put it into a spin and went straight down to 2000 feet

1:18:46.360 --> 1:18:48.000
 and come out under it.

1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:51.280
 And I was flying along the Guaviera River

1:18:52.360 --> 1:18:54.680
 and it was 20 feet above the water.

1:18:54.680 --> 1:18:57.480
 It looked like a pasture, it was just grass.

1:18:57.480 --> 1:19:00.680
 And I made several runs to tear the grass down

1:19:00.680 --> 1:19:02.600
 and it looked like, and it felt hard.

1:19:02.600 --> 1:19:04.680
 That old DC three weighs 30,000 pounds

1:19:04.680 --> 1:19:06.760
 and I put it down on the fifth run.

1:19:06.760 --> 1:19:08.920
 I said, all right, now we're gonna land now.

1:19:08.920 --> 1:19:09.760
 And as I was.

1:19:09.760 --> 1:19:11.840
 Did you do like close several times?

1:19:11.840 --> 1:19:12.760
 I put the wheels down.

1:19:12.760 --> 1:19:15.200
 Oh, you put the wheels down without landing.

1:19:15.200 --> 1:19:18.760
 And just, so I'm making a run for it, you know.

1:19:18.760 --> 1:19:19.760
 So you, okay.

1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:23.000
 So you're being tracked by a jet.

1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:23.840
 He's going.

1:19:23.840 --> 1:19:25.800
 He's trying to, well, before that,

1:19:25.800 --> 1:19:29.200
 I'm just like retelling this story, how insane it is.

1:19:29.200 --> 1:19:32.080
 So he's trying to shoot you down

1:19:32.080 --> 1:19:36.000
 and there's a thunderstorm that you're escaping into.

1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:39.740
 And then you do a spin down to what, 2000 feet?

1:19:39.740 --> 1:19:43.360
 Whatever you said, like somehow escaping all of this.

1:19:43.360 --> 1:19:46.340
 And then you try to land on a pasture

1:19:46.340 --> 1:19:50.000
 on a giant heavy plane that carries three tons

1:19:51.720 --> 1:19:55.240
 by touching down five or six times

1:19:55.240 --> 1:19:58.800
 to make a landing strip for yourself.

1:19:58.800 --> 1:20:01.640
 Yeah, the grass is three or four feet high.

1:20:01.640 --> 1:20:04.440
 So it looked really good after about, after a few times.

1:20:04.440 --> 1:20:05.720
 So then just before it stopped,

1:20:05.720 --> 1:20:07.600
 I said, Al, take your feet off the brakes.

1:20:07.600 --> 1:20:09.200
 He said, I don't have my feet on the brakes.

1:20:09.200 --> 1:20:11.800
 Well, I knew I had broken through the crust

1:20:11.800 --> 1:20:13.840
 and I put full power on, but it didn't.

1:20:13.840 --> 1:20:15.520
 That old big plane just come on down

1:20:15.520 --> 1:20:18.440
 and it just did a head, as it came to a stop,

1:20:18.440 --> 1:20:21.920
 it did a headstand, 90 degrees to the ground.

1:20:21.920 --> 1:20:22.760
 Oh, wow.

1:20:22.760 --> 1:20:24.880
 And the engines held it up

1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:27.140
 and the nose and all just crushed in right on it.

1:20:27.140 --> 1:20:29.600
 We fell between the two seats to keep from getting killed.

1:20:29.600 --> 1:20:30.440
 Wow.

1:20:30.440 --> 1:20:31.320
 And when it come to a stop,

1:20:31.320 --> 1:20:34.160
 all that fuel was pouring out on those hot engines

1:20:34.160 --> 1:20:35.680
 and there was an escape hatch at the top.

1:20:35.680 --> 1:20:39.320
 I just stepped out, took my suitcase with me.

1:20:40.640 --> 1:20:41.480
 Was there fire?

1:20:41.480 --> 1:20:43.240
 No fire, left the plane there

1:20:43.240 --> 1:20:44.480
 and the two guys that was in the back,

1:20:44.480 --> 1:20:46.840
 one of them broke his thumb and it was with the barrels

1:20:46.840 --> 1:20:49.000
 and they had to put a hose,

1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:51.840
 tie gas hose together to shimmy down to get out.

1:20:51.840 --> 1:20:53.320
 Yeah.

1:20:53.320 --> 1:20:54.160
 So.

1:20:54.160 --> 1:20:55.780
 That's an incredible story.

1:20:55.780 --> 1:20:56.800
 Well, let me just tell you,

1:20:56.800 --> 1:20:58.160
 they had a little bit more to it.

1:20:58.160 --> 1:20:59.400
 I learned to fly with the idea

1:20:59.400 --> 1:21:02.440
 of being a missionary aviation fellowship pilot,

1:21:02.440 --> 1:21:04.800
 fly the missionaries in and out of the jungle.

1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:06.480
 Well, I went 11 days through that jungle.

1:21:06.480 --> 1:21:09.040
 The rest of them went on down the road and went to prison.

1:21:09.040 --> 1:21:12.560
 I said, I'll crawl on my belly six months in here a year,

1:21:12.560 --> 1:21:14.800
 eating snakes before I'm going down the road.

1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:18.120
 So I went in there and I was 11 days in the jungle

1:21:18.120 --> 1:21:21.600
 and I finally came to this place and it had airplanes.

1:21:21.600 --> 1:21:24.080
 I kept asking the Indian, dandistai avions.

1:21:24.080 --> 1:21:26.460
 I want to steal an airplane and get out of there.

1:21:26.460 --> 1:21:28.320
 And when I came to the place,

1:21:28.320 --> 1:21:29.800
 I asked, what is this place?

1:21:29.800 --> 1:21:30.640
 Lovely place.

1:21:30.640 --> 1:21:34.160
 It looked like Honolulu in World War II.

1:21:34.160 --> 1:21:35.080
 There was a runway there.

1:21:35.080 --> 1:21:36.680
 Said, you don't know.

1:21:36.680 --> 1:21:38.240
 This is Loma Linda headquarters

1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:41.780
 for Missionary Aviation Fellowship for the Amazon.

1:21:41.780 --> 1:21:43.240
 And they flew me out.

1:21:43.240 --> 1:21:44.160
 Wow.

1:21:44.160 --> 1:21:48.920
 You escaped from prison five times?

1:21:48.920 --> 1:21:52.560
 So what stands out to you as the most difficult

1:21:52.560 --> 1:21:55.680
 or miraculous escape in the bunch?

1:21:58.660 --> 1:22:00.040
 The most black miraculous was

1:22:00.040 --> 1:22:01.720
 when I was in the courtroom in Spain.

1:22:01.720 --> 1:22:04.400
 I think I was on the third floor of Real High

1:22:04.400 --> 1:22:06.840
 and I ran across the courtroom, handcuffed,

1:22:06.840 --> 1:22:08.200
 kicked the window out.

1:22:08.200 --> 1:22:10.480
 And I looked down and it was above the palm trees.

1:22:10.480 --> 1:22:11.840
 I thought there might be a power line

1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:13.860
 or something I could grab on as I went down.

1:22:13.860 --> 1:22:14.980
 There was nothing.

1:22:14.980 --> 1:22:18.400
 And there was a car parked, a station wagon on the side.

1:22:18.400 --> 1:22:19.600
 You just jumped out?

1:22:19.600 --> 1:22:22.660
 I jumped out from 31 feet and on top of that car.

1:22:22.660 --> 1:22:24.560
 And it exploded in the street.

1:22:24.560 --> 1:22:26.600
 The windshield went over three or four cars.

1:22:26.600 --> 1:22:27.960
 It looked like snow going up.

1:22:27.960 --> 1:22:30.880
 And I looked like Donald Duck with the thing coming off

1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:32.600
 and handcuffs and I got out.

1:22:32.600 --> 1:22:33.440
 And you just kept running?

1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:34.280
 Yeah, I kept running.

1:22:34.280 --> 1:22:35.800
 They ran me down and hit me in the back.

1:22:35.800 --> 1:22:37.200
 I still got a dead spot in my back

1:22:37.200 --> 1:22:39.960
 where the policeman hit me with a shotgun.

1:22:39.960 --> 1:22:41.100
 And they brought me back.

1:22:41.100 --> 1:22:43.260
 Murray was there and they were saying,

1:22:43.260 --> 1:22:44.700
 your husband is crazy.

1:22:44.700 --> 1:22:45.760
 That was spectacular.

1:22:45.760 --> 1:22:48.820
 But I escaped from Lubeck, maximum security prison.

1:22:48.820 --> 1:22:50.640
 And I cut out of there and got out.

1:22:50.640 --> 1:22:51.480
 That was a miraculous escape.

1:22:51.480 --> 1:22:52.420
 And that was where?

1:22:52.420 --> 1:22:54.120
 In Lubeck, Germany.

1:22:54.120 --> 1:22:56.520
 What was that escape like?

1:22:56.520 --> 1:22:59.280
 I was there and they was going to extradite me

1:22:59.280 --> 1:23:00.200
 back to the United States

1:23:00.200 --> 1:23:01.640
 where I still had all these charges

1:23:01.640 --> 1:23:03.460
 and 25 years special parole.

1:23:04.360 --> 1:23:09.360
 And I was cleaning the lawyer's visiting room

1:23:10.520 --> 1:23:14.800
 and on it was bars that looked like piano notes

1:23:14.800 --> 1:23:17.000
 or this way to make it pretty.

1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:18.880
 But they was a little bit,

1:23:18.880 --> 1:23:22.640
 so I got a rope from a guy where they made boats in there.

1:23:22.640 --> 1:23:25.780
 And I had 20 minutes.

1:23:25.780 --> 1:23:27.480
 So I went in there and I wrapped it around

1:23:27.480 --> 1:23:28.680
 and I put a broom handle in it

1:23:28.680 --> 1:23:30.360
 that was cut off and wrapped it around

1:23:30.360 --> 1:23:33.000
 until they pull the bars together on that side.

1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:34.400
 And then I pulled them together on the other side.

1:23:34.400 --> 1:23:37.720
 But that only put me in inside the prison yard

1:23:37.720 --> 1:23:40.680
 where the soccer equipment was kept.

1:23:40.680 --> 1:23:44.420
 But they were putting new windows on one side of the prison

1:23:44.420 --> 1:23:47.460
 and they had it scaffolded up to the fourth floor.

1:23:47.460 --> 1:23:48.800
 So there was a little recess there

1:23:48.800 --> 1:23:52.080
 and there was guard towers every 100 feet or so.

1:23:52.080 --> 1:23:53.880
 I mean, they would shoot and kill you.

1:23:53.880 --> 1:23:57.900
 So I got behind that and climbed up holding to the bricks

1:23:57.900 --> 1:23:59.720
 on one hand and the scaffolding on the other

1:23:59.720 --> 1:24:00.600
 and went to the roof.

1:24:00.600 --> 1:24:02.160
 I lost my shirt and most of my clothes

1:24:02.160 --> 1:24:03.120
 going through the window.

1:24:03.120 --> 1:24:04.520
 I got all the skin off of me.

1:24:04.520 --> 1:24:05.780
 I thought I was gonna die.

1:24:05.780 --> 1:24:07.440
 And I was trying to go sideways like this.

1:24:07.440 --> 1:24:10.440
 And finally I got a grip and the bars let me through

1:24:10.440 --> 1:24:12.360
 and took all the skin off of me.

1:24:12.360 --> 1:24:14.760
 So I got up on that roof and I have asthma

1:24:14.760 --> 1:24:16.600
 and I just lay there trying to catch my breath.

1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:17.800
 Didn't bring my inhaler.

1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:21.200
 With blood everywhere.

1:24:21.200 --> 1:24:22.680
 Oh, I was bloody, yes.

1:24:22.680 --> 1:24:24.440
 And so I got down to the end

1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:26.200
 and on the end, the reason I did it,

1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:29.080
 they would put it, they was putting a new wall again

1:24:29.080 --> 1:24:32.040
 around the prison to make it larger.

1:24:32.900 --> 1:24:36.960
 And they had taken all the wire off above the Sally port

1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:38.620
 where they could join the two walls together.

1:24:38.620 --> 1:24:42.040
 And I saw that when I came up and there was a guard,

1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:46.520
 a half of like a dome sticking out of that brick building

1:24:46.520 --> 1:24:48.840
 where there's a guard there with a gun and he'd kill you.

1:24:48.840 --> 1:24:49.680
 And I mean, he was made,

1:24:49.680 --> 1:24:51.400
 he was surely trained to kill you.

1:24:51.400 --> 1:24:53.960
 And we had some bad people in that place.

1:24:53.960 --> 1:24:56.520
 So I lay up one floor above it

1:24:56.520 --> 1:24:59.120
 and I saw a guard and his wife come with a double umbrella.

1:24:59.120 --> 1:25:00.720
 It was just pouring down the rain.

1:25:00.720 --> 1:25:03.100
 Here I am without a shirt on, bloody.

1:25:03.100 --> 1:25:07.240
 And she had a little boy with him under that double umbrella

1:25:07.240 --> 1:25:08.600
 and I knew him and when he come

1:25:08.600 --> 1:25:10.800
 and she started back from the Sally port,

1:25:10.800 --> 1:25:15.000
 I hit the top of that guard tower, bam, with both feet.

1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:17.260
 And I jumped, I guess it's three more floors.

1:25:17.260 --> 1:25:19.240
 I jumped, there was a pile of sand,

1:25:19.240 --> 1:25:21.200
 like a cone where they were digging it there.

1:25:21.200 --> 1:25:24.600
 And I hit that and my feet buried up to the knees,

1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:26.080
 but I didn't fall.

1:25:26.080 --> 1:25:28.840
 And I ran straight towards her so he couldn't shoot me.

1:25:28.840 --> 1:25:31.480
 And then I went around some bushes and went downhill.

1:25:33.040 --> 1:25:35.840
 And then I heard bam, bam, bam, bam, bam behind me.

1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:38.280
 And I looked and that fool woman was in a big old car

1:25:38.280 --> 1:25:41.200
 and she was knocking down the parking meters behind me.

1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:42.640
 She was trying to run over me.

1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:44.600
 And I ran behind the car

1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:47.260
 and she tore the fender off of her car,

1:25:47.260 --> 1:25:49.000
 trying to yell and yow, yow, yow,

1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:51.640
 and a terrible evil looking face at me, screaming at me.

1:25:51.640 --> 1:25:53.840
 And the sirens going off in the prison.

1:25:54.880 --> 1:25:57.240
 And there was a fence there, a wall.

1:25:57.240 --> 1:25:58.980
 And I jumped up on it to jump over

1:25:58.980 --> 1:26:00.560
 and it had glass embedded.

1:26:00.560 --> 1:26:03.320
 And I cut my hands and my arms all up getting over that.

1:26:03.320 --> 1:26:04.960
 And I hit the ground on the other side

1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:07.720
 and it was like, it was that mucked muck

1:26:07.720 --> 1:26:09.560
 where some farmer had dug it.

1:26:09.560 --> 1:26:12.680
 I dug in there and Maury had slipped me $200 into prison.

1:26:12.680 --> 1:26:15.440
 And I had that in my shoe and I lost my shoes in that muck.

1:26:15.440 --> 1:26:17.680
 But anyway, I got out of there and got to Holland.

1:26:17.680 --> 1:26:19.680
 Really a heck of a story how I did that.

1:26:20.640 --> 1:26:23.360
 What was prison like, whether it's Germany

1:26:23.360 --> 1:26:24.920
 or whether it's Australia?

1:26:24.920 --> 1:26:28.160
 What were some of the darker moments in prison?

1:26:28.160 --> 1:26:30.360
 The United States prisons are awful,

1:26:30.360 --> 1:26:32.200
 awful evil places now.

1:26:32.200 --> 1:26:34.700
 And just really, there's nothing nice about them.

1:26:34.700 --> 1:26:36.000
 There's the guards.

1:26:37.160 --> 1:26:38.400
 In LA?

1:26:38.400 --> 1:26:40.600
 And everyone I went to.

1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:42.360
 It seemed like the further east I went to Oklahoma

1:26:42.360 --> 1:26:45.400
 and it was nicer, but all of them on the West Coast,

1:26:45.400 --> 1:26:47.120
 they was hatred there.

1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:50.920
 And they got really stupid people hired, just incredibly.

1:26:50.920 --> 1:26:52.720
 Oh, hatred by the guards.

1:26:52.720 --> 1:26:55.600
 And the inmates, like I speak Spanish

1:26:55.600 --> 1:26:58.840
 and I walked in to the Spanish TV room

1:26:58.840 --> 1:27:01.960
 and it was saying, you know, no, you can't come in here.

1:27:01.960 --> 1:27:03.320
 And I walked across to the black,

1:27:03.320 --> 1:27:06.000
 hey, get out of here, white boy.

1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:07.880
 It was just like, what?

1:27:07.880 --> 1:27:10.200
 Man, I like all you people, you know?

1:27:10.200 --> 1:27:12.120
 And so I walked down to the white people and said,

1:27:12.120 --> 1:27:13.840
 show us your paperwork.

1:27:13.840 --> 1:27:16.560
 You can't come in here until you show your paperwork.

1:27:16.560 --> 1:27:19.000
 We don't let snitches and homosexuals

1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.160
 and all this sort of stuff in here.

1:27:21.160 --> 1:27:23.820
 So they have, so it's just like,

1:27:23.820 --> 1:27:25.520
 man, I don't wanna be in here.

1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:26.800
 I mean, it sounds absurd,

1:27:26.800 --> 1:27:29.800
 but you're saying like the basic humanity is gone.

1:27:29.800 --> 1:27:32.360
 Completely, completely in the guards.

1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:35.000
 It was just like, come here, Reeves.

1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:37.880
 And I woke up to him, get the fuck out of my face.

1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:40.920
 Sticks his chin out, like for me to break his jaw.

1:27:40.920 --> 1:27:44.080
 Like, what in the world, man?

1:27:44.080 --> 1:27:45.440
 I love people and it's just.

1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:48.320
 Yeah, you got this joy to you.

1:27:48.320 --> 1:27:50.000
 You have a joyful nature.

1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:53.600
 And it didn't seem like that broke you.

1:27:53.600 --> 1:27:54.920
 Not a bit.

1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:56.700
 How did you persevere?

1:27:56.700 --> 1:27:58.160
 Did you know, I didn't even think I persevered,

1:27:58.160 --> 1:28:01.720
 but I try to enjoy my life wherever I am every day.

1:28:01.720 --> 1:28:02.560
 I do.

1:28:02.560 --> 1:28:03.920
 I ran every day.

1:28:03.920 --> 1:28:06.240
 And like I told you, why do you run so, Roger?

1:28:06.240 --> 1:28:08.440
 I said, to help me suffer these fools.

1:28:08.440 --> 1:28:10.720
 And I played a game of chess every day,

1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:12.280
 almost of my life in there.

1:28:12.280 --> 1:28:14.480
 And I read two books a week.

1:28:14.480 --> 1:28:16.480
 And I talked with people, storytellers,

1:28:16.480 --> 1:28:18.840
 guys would come in and, tell us another story, Roger.

1:28:18.840 --> 1:28:19.680
 Give us a poem.

1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:21.440
 Tell us one you never told us before.

1:28:21.440 --> 1:28:22.440
 And so it was just nice.

1:28:22.440 --> 1:28:23.920
 A lot of them have original boys.

1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:27.800
 They picked their country music and it was all right.

1:28:28.800 --> 1:28:31.080
 Red, Morgan Freeman's character

1:28:31.080 --> 1:28:35.280
 in The Shawshank Redemption says the following.

1:28:35.280 --> 1:28:36.780
 These walls are funny.

1:28:36.780 --> 1:28:39.560
 First you hate them, then you get used to them.

1:28:39.560 --> 1:28:42.960
 Enough time passes you get, so you depend on them.

1:28:42.960 --> 1:28:44.900
 That's institutionalized.

1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:47.160
 Is there truth to that?

1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:49.560
 100%, I didn't even see the walls,

1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:51.720
 except whenever I was planning on escaping.

1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:56.160
 In Shawshank Redemption, he spent so many years in prison

1:28:56.160 --> 1:29:00.200
 that he almost didn't know what to do with himself

1:29:00.200 --> 1:29:02.800
 once he left, once he was a free man.

1:29:03.880 --> 1:29:08.240
 That's the, you get so used to the system,

1:29:08.240 --> 1:29:12.940
 the rituals, having to follow orders,

1:29:15.240 --> 1:29:16.900
 even being treated poorly,

1:29:16.900 --> 1:29:20.160
 all those kinds of things that you become dependent on.

1:29:20.160 --> 1:29:23.980
 Well, down in Australia, I spent the first,

1:29:23.980 --> 1:29:26.500
 a little over a year in the shoe.

1:29:26.500 --> 1:29:28.820
 It was like, did you see the movie,

1:29:28.820 --> 1:29:32.360
 The Silence of the Lambs, thank you, Marty.

1:29:32.360 --> 1:29:34.740
 And he said, I had five or six guards

1:29:34.740 --> 1:29:36.980
 looking at me with a one way mirror.

1:29:36.980 --> 1:29:38.960
 And that's whenever I thought I might never get out,

1:29:38.960 --> 1:29:40.080
 I got a life sentence.

1:29:40.080 --> 1:29:43.000
 I had all this time waiting here in Germany.

1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:48.000
 And so that's, they had a computer in there,

1:29:48.400 --> 1:29:50.040
 but it didn't have a program on it.

1:29:50.040 --> 1:29:51.640
 And I wrote, so I just started writing

1:29:51.640 --> 1:29:53.560
 these little stories of stuff I did in my life.

1:29:53.560 --> 1:29:57.280
 And I wrote one line and I wrote over a million words

1:29:57.280 --> 1:29:58.120
 with them looking at me.

1:29:58.120 --> 1:29:59.920
 So it was after a year, they let me out.

1:29:59.920 --> 1:30:01.240
 It wasn't long before they put me

1:30:01.240 --> 1:30:02.920
 in a place called Self Care.

1:30:02.920 --> 1:30:07.860
 And particularly, I was in what they call the lifers pod.

1:30:07.860 --> 1:30:10.700
 There was 268 men in Self Care there.

1:30:10.700 --> 1:30:15.700
 And it was unbelievably good that we were left alone.

1:30:17.300 --> 1:30:19.300
 Basically, they was there or the guards

1:30:19.300 --> 1:30:22.160
 were certainly there, but they had their shack

1:30:22.160 --> 1:30:26.780
 and we had apartments, four apartments to the building.

1:30:26.780 --> 1:30:29.660
 And six men to the unit with your own door

1:30:29.660 --> 1:30:32.420
 and a key to it and a kitchen, dining room,

1:30:32.420 --> 1:30:34.020
 freezer, refrigerator.

1:30:34.020 --> 1:30:38.380
 And they gave you, allowed you $360 a week to buy groceries.

1:30:38.380 --> 1:30:43.060
 And I cooked for about 16 years and learned to cook good.

1:30:43.060 --> 1:30:46.580
 And the people and other people have their specialties.

1:30:46.580 --> 1:30:51.580
 And so that was quite, it wasn't so like being in prison.

1:30:53.160 --> 1:30:55.620
 It was somewhat living with me and it was difficult, man.

1:30:55.620 --> 1:30:58.660
 I had some good fights and carry on.

1:30:58.660 --> 1:31:00.540
 You don't get along with everybody.

1:31:00.540 --> 1:31:03.660
 But then whenever I came back to the United States,

1:31:03.660 --> 1:31:05.500
 I was laughing and talking.

1:31:05.500 --> 1:31:07.940
 And when I got off the plane in LA,

1:31:07.940 --> 1:31:11.100
 I had three marshals with me from Australia.

1:31:11.100 --> 1:31:13.020
 I was slammed upside the wall.

1:31:13.020 --> 1:31:18.020
 I mean, hard, put ankle mics on and handcuffed so tight

1:31:19.220 --> 1:31:20.980
 till they cut my lane off.

1:31:20.980 --> 1:31:23.780
 Face forward, face forward, lands apart.

1:31:23.780 --> 1:31:25.180
 Good gracious.

1:31:25.180 --> 1:31:28.500
 And walked me 50 steps and turned me over to the marshals

1:31:28.500 --> 1:31:29.700
 and they took part of that off.

1:31:29.700 --> 1:31:31.700
 That was a border patrol that was there

1:31:31.700 --> 1:31:34.700
 over my marijuana charge from 1977.

1:31:36.340 --> 1:31:38.460
 I did 11 years for parole violation.

1:31:38.460 --> 1:31:40.140
 Now they want me for more violation.

1:31:40.140 --> 1:31:42.660
 And they put me in, down in Los Angeles,

1:31:42.660 --> 1:31:45.300
 they put me in, the marshals put me in there

1:31:45.300 --> 1:31:47.260
 and they put me in isolation.

1:31:47.260 --> 1:31:50.420
 I thought, what in the world they got me for isolation for?

1:31:50.420 --> 1:31:51.420
 I'm doing anything.

1:31:53.140 --> 1:31:55.380
 How long did you spend in isolation?

1:31:55.380 --> 1:31:57.140
 More than six months.

1:31:57.140 --> 1:32:00.060
 So I, after three or four days

1:32:00.060 --> 1:32:02.580
 as the little Judas window slide open

1:32:02.580 --> 1:32:04.460
 and a man, a nice looking man in a suit come there,

1:32:04.460 --> 1:32:07.500
 hello Reeves, I wanna, just wanna see what you look like.

1:32:07.500 --> 1:32:10.220
 I saw your National Geographic documentary

1:32:10.220 --> 1:32:12.780
 and it does me pleasure to keep you in isolation.

1:32:12.780 --> 1:32:15.180
 And he slammed the thing and I couldn't get out of there.

1:32:15.180 --> 1:32:17.140
 And by law, the US Parole Commission

1:32:17.140 --> 1:32:20.300
 is supposed to give you a hearing within 90 days.

1:32:20.300 --> 1:32:22.820
 So Murray paid a lawyer $7,500

1:32:22.820 --> 1:32:25.180
 and he never picked up the phone.

1:32:25.180 --> 1:32:28.540
 Somebody got to him.

1:32:28.540 --> 1:32:29.820
 Who's that somebody you think?

1:32:29.820 --> 1:32:31.180
 Christopher Cannon was his name

1:32:31.180 --> 1:32:32.540
 and I don't know who got to him,

1:32:32.540 --> 1:32:35.700
 but he didn't do anything to get me out of there.

1:32:35.700 --> 1:32:38.420
 I got one 15 minute phone call a month

1:32:38.420 --> 1:32:39.620
 and I couldn't get out.

1:32:40.540 --> 1:32:45.540
 So then after six months, they put me on Conair,

1:32:47.340 --> 1:32:51.540
 double shackled and black box on my hands.

1:32:51.540 --> 1:32:53.780
 And I went to Oklahoma

1:32:53.780 --> 1:32:58.540
 and they let me out on the floor.

1:32:58.540 --> 1:32:59.420
 I couldn't imagine.

1:32:59.420 --> 1:33:01.540
 Then I could call after a couple of days

1:33:01.540 --> 1:33:03.900
 and they said, there was a man here from Washington

1:33:03.900 --> 1:33:07.060
 give you a parole hearing and you only got here at 3.30.

1:33:07.060 --> 1:33:09.220
 So he left, he said he'd be back next year.

1:33:10.100 --> 1:33:11.220
 What?

1:33:11.220 --> 1:33:13.020
 I've been in now over six months.

1:33:13.020 --> 1:33:14.540
 So then there was a lovely little lady,

1:33:14.540 --> 1:33:16.780
 she was a case manager or something.

1:33:16.780 --> 1:33:19.940
 She said, you can ask for parole on the record.

1:33:19.940 --> 1:33:21.460
 And I said, please do.

1:33:21.460 --> 1:33:22.780
 So I sent them an email

1:33:22.780 --> 1:33:25.140
 and the next day I got my parole.

1:33:25.140 --> 1:33:27.420
 90 days later, they sent me to Terminal Island

1:33:27.420 --> 1:33:29.780
 and put me in the place there with the invalid,

1:33:29.780 --> 1:33:32.740
 I guess since I'm as old as I am, 78 years old.

1:33:32.740 --> 1:33:34.380
 So they put me in the people in there dying

1:33:34.380 --> 1:33:38.220
 and wheelchairs and legs off and arms off and cancer.

1:33:38.220 --> 1:33:40.780
 So I was in there and I pushed the fellows around

1:33:40.780 --> 1:33:44.060
 and I went, come out of the chow hall there

1:33:44.060 --> 1:33:46.420
 and I went to go to the right to get me a haircut

1:33:46.420 --> 1:33:49.340
 and the two Mexican guys there, Lieutenant and another one,

1:33:49.340 --> 1:33:52.020
 walked between us and he went like the boop, boop, boop.

1:33:52.020 --> 1:33:53.420
 I could outrun you.

1:33:53.420 --> 1:33:55.940
 And they slammed me, put me on the ground,

1:33:55.940 --> 1:33:58.300
 handcuffed me and put me in the shoe for a week.

1:33:59.180 --> 1:34:02.140
 I got out and man, they put me back in the place.

1:34:02.140 --> 1:34:04.100
 They treated me rough.

1:34:04.100 --> 1:34:06.660
 So I got in a little more trouble

1:34:06.660 --> 1:34:10.700
 and they put me back in the shoe and I wouldn't come out.

1:34:10.700 --> 1:34:14.060
 They had that, the virus was out killing people.

1:34:14.060 --> 1:34:16.980
 So they killed eight people in that unit I was in.

1:34:16.980 --> 1:34:19.260
 So I mean, I wouldn't even come out to take a shower.

1:34:19.260 --> 1:34:22.140
 I had a little straw that I put in the sink

1:34:22.140 --> 1:34:26.340
 and I'd take a sock that I had and scrub myself with it

1:34:26.340 --> 1:34:28.780
 with some slope and a glass of water over my head

1:34:28.780 --> 1:34:31.060
 and then clean the floor up and put it in the toilet.

1:34:31.060 --> 1:34:34.180
 So that was your time during the coronavirus pandemic.

1:34:34.180 --> 1:34:36.580
 I got out last April, right in the middle of it

1:34:36.580 --> 1:34:39.020
 and they were dying bad in there.

1:34:40.420 --> 1:34:42.700
 So I was treated worse for that last year in America

1:34:42.700 --> 1:34:44.860
 than I was for the whole 20 years in Australia,

1:34:44.860 --> 1:34:46.660
 the 18 years in Australia.

1:34:46.660 --> 1:34:50.780
 And then you were a free man at the end of that year.

1:34:50.780 --> 1:34:52.460
 They put me out and sent me home

1:34:52.460 --> 1:34:54.600
 and the parole officers couldn't even come.

1:34:54.600 --> 1:34:55.440
 They weren't working.

1:34:55.440 --> 1:34:57.340
 They were just doing everything by video.

1:34:57.340 --> 1:35:00.020
 They said, better not have a drink.

1:35:00.020 --> 1:35:01.740
 The only constituent thing was

1:35:01.740 --> 1:35:03.620
 I couldn't even have a drink of wine.

1:35:03.620 --> 1:35:08.580
 So after a year, I had to take psychiatric treatment.

1:35:08.580 --> 1:35:11.220
 Every week I had to go talk to the psychiatrist,

1:35:11.220 --> 1:35:14.220
 psychologist and me and her got along great.

1:35:14.220 --> 1:35:15.460
 She was a good Christian woman.

1:35:15.460 --> 1:35:16.900
 We just chatted and talked.

1:35:16.900 --> 1:35:17.740
 And I think they said,

1:35:17.740 --> 1:35:19.780
 so I had to pee in the bottle every week.

1:35:19.780 --> 1:35:21.360
 I said, I've been in 33 years.

1:35:21.360 --> 1:35:23.680
 How many piss deaths do you think I've had?

1:35:23.680 --> 1:35:24.520
 Never been dirty.

1:35:24.520 --> 1:35:26.940
 Only thing if you all wanna clean when you come get me.

1:35:26.940 --> 1:35:29.020
 Before I talk to you about love,

1:35:29.020 --> 1:35:32.300
 let me ask you a difficult question.

1:35:33.220 --> 1:35:34.740
 You write in your book,

1:35:34.740 --> 1:35:37.400
 ''I don't consider myself much of a criminal.

1:35:37.400 --> 1:35:39.660
 I don't lie, cheat or steal.

1:35:39.660 --> 1:35:43.020
 And I always take up for the underdog.

1:35:43.020 --> 1:35:45.380
 Violence makes me sick.

1:35:45.380 --> 1:35:47.740
 Yet I know I'm an outlaw

1:35:47.740 --> 1:35:50.280
 and those that break the law must be punished.

1:35:51.280 --> 1:35:53.520
 I think many people listening to this

1:35:53.520 --> 1:35:55.660
 or some people listening to this

1:35:55.660 --> 1:35:58.720
 will see you as a criminal, as a bad man

1:35:58.720 --> 1:36:01.320
 who increased the amount of suffering in this world.

1:36:02.560 --> 1:36:04.260
 What do you have to say to them?

1:36:06.060 --> 1:36:06.900
 I would like to tell them

1:36:06.900 --> 1:36:10.780
 that they have been indoctrinated by the spin

1:36:10.780 --> 1:36:12.700
 of news and politicians

1:36:12.700 --> 1:36:15.460
 and they don't know the truth of the situation.

1:36:15.460 --> 1:36:17.180
 You lay the truth out there in an envelope,

1:36:17.180 --> 1:36:20.620
 let me open it besides something else that is false

1:36:20.620 --> 1:36:22.020
 and it's staggering.

1:36:22.020 --> 1:36:24.780
 The truth is that I was a tobacco farmer

1:36:26.500 --> 1:36:31.100
 and tobacco kills 500,000 people a year in America

1:36:31.100 --> 1:36:34.820
 and 6 million have debilitating diseases because of it.

1:36:36.820 --> 1:36:39.980
 Drugs, all drugs combined kill

1:36:39.980 --> 1:36:43.220
 between 10 and 15,000 people a year by overdose

1:36:43.220 --> 1:36:45.720
 and 60% of those are pharmaceutical.

1:36:46.580 --> 1:36:48.340
 Now, then when I was a tobacco farmer,

1:36:48.340 --> 1:36:50.200
 come sit on the front pew, Mr. Reeves,

1:36:50.200 --> 1:36:52.100
 come on up here, you're a gentleman.

1:36:52.100 --> 1:36:55.020
 You just joined the Masonic Lodge and you joined our church

1:36:55.020 --> 1:36:58.160
 and you just come on and sit down with the good people.

1:36:58.160 --> 1:36:59.860
 You grow two marijuana plants,

1:36:59.860 --> 1:37:02.100
 get out of here you scumbag

1:37:02.100 --> 1:37:04.380
 and the marijuana doesn't hurt anybody.

1:37:04.380 --> 1:37:06.560
 It's just, that's the truth of it.

1:37:06.560 --> 1:37:10.640
 And so in your career,

1:37:11.800 --> 1:37:16.000
 you walked amidst violence

1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.100
 but you never participated in the violence.

1:37:18.100 --> 1:37:19.300
 I didn't even see it.

1:37:21.860 --> 1:37:23.920
 Just didn't happen around me, in prison it did.

1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:25.600
 I sewed people up, they called me doc.

1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:30.600
 I had dental floss and one time I had to get a blade

1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:35.960
 and try to help keep from my patient from getting again.

1:37:35.960 --> 1:37:40.520
 But I was just like, if I shot at those people,

1:37:40.520 --> 1:37:42.760
 I shot at them to keep them from killing me.

1:37:42.760 --> 1:37:44.560
 I certainly didn't mean to kill them.

1:37:45.440 --> 1:37:47.600
 So that's just, some people are evil

1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:49.760
 and they will kill you and hurt you and lie to you.

1:37:49.760 --> 1:37:51.120
 I just don't do any of that.

1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:52.960
 It just makes you sick.

1:37:52.960 --> 1:37:54.120
 I've seen it.

1:37:54.120 --> 1:37:56.640
 When I was in the shoe, three guys tried to kill a guy

1:37:56.640 --> 1:37:57.840
 and they stabbed him so many times,

1:37:57.840 --> 1:38:01.440
 but they stabbed Blake and the blood getting out of the room.

1:38:01.440 --> 1:38:02.280
 I said, you're gonna kill him.

1:38:02.280 --> 1:38:04.080
 You're gonna kill him and save his life.

1:38:04.080 --> 1:38:06.800
 Drug him up there where the guards could see him.

1:38:06.800 --> 1:38:07.640
 There's stuff like that.

1:38:07.640 --> 1:38:09.960
 I'm just not of that nature of those people.

1:38:09.960 --> 1:38:10.960
 They're just evil.

1:38:10.960 --> 1:38:12.840
 They're people born evil, I believe.

1:38:15.160 --> 1:38:18.240
 It is heartbreaking to hear that the basic humanity

1:38:18.240 --> 1:38:21.360
 is gone in prison in the United States.

1:38:21.360 --> 1:38:23.560
 That's heartbreaking because that basic humanity

1:38:23.560 --> 1:38:25.480
 is actually the light at the end of the tunnel.

1:38:25.480 --> 1:38:28.160
 It's the thing that saves us as opposed to,

1:38:28.160 --> 1:38:30.720
 when it's absent, it's the thing that destroys us.

1:38:30.720 --> 1:38:34.200
 The prisons are filled, absolutely filled with people

1:38:34.200 --> 1:38:35.960
 that have some mental problems.

1:38:37.200 --> 1:38:40.760
 Now, you see Tent City all the way up and down here.

1:38:40.760 --> 1:38:42.560
 I guarantee you, every one of those people

1:38:42.560 --> 1:38:45.720
 have mental problems, some degree.

1:38:45.720 --> 1:38:48.480
 However little it is, but they are a little bit off.

1:38:48.480 --> 1:38:50.720
 Now, then you get a DEA agent

1:38:50.720 --> 1:38:52.520
 that wants to make a name for himself.

1:38:52.520 --> 1:38:54.000
 He goes down there and gets two of them,

1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:56.600
 one of them to sell a little two grams of methamphetamine

1:38:56.600 --> 1:38:58.760
 to the other one, and he gets a conviction.

1:38:58.760 --> 1:39:00.880
 And a young prosecutor, he gets a conviction.

1:39:00.880 --> 1:39:02.440
 He wants to make a judge.

1:39:02.440 --> 1:39:04.760
 And we got the judge in, where was it?

1:39:04.760 --> 1:39:06.760
 I'm gonna give a million, what was his name?

1:39:06.760 --> 1:39:07.600
 Gilbert.

1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:09.320
 I'm gonna give him in a million years

1:39:09.320 --> 1:39:10.440
 before I get off the judge.

1:39:10.440 --> 1:39:14.680
 You get fools like that in charge.

1:39:14.680 --> 1:39:19.160
 You're gonna fill prisons up with pitiful humanity.

1:39:20.040 --> 1:39:21.240
 And those are the ones.

1:39:21.240 --> 1:39:25.480
 And then the other is people over drugs.

1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:29.760
 And drugs should be a health issue.

1:39:31.760 --> 1:39:36.160
 You cannot police it enough.

1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:38.280
 It's just, they know the only thing

1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:41.160
 that overdoses is opioids, the heroin.

1:39:41.160 --> 1:39:42.320
 And if they can give it to him,

1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:43.680
 it costs about a dollar a day

1:39:43.680 --> 1:39:46.640
 to give the worst addict his fix.

1:39:46.640 --> 1:39:47.720
 But they'll give it methadone,

1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:49.640
 which is from a pharmaceutical company,

1:39:49.640 --> 1:39:51.440
 which is just as bad.

1:39:51.440 --> 1:39:54.560
 Why in the world, we tried it all over the world

1:39:54.560 --> 1:39:57.480
 in Portugal and England.

1:39:57.480 --> 1:40:00.280
 And when they give the girls cleanup,

1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:03.640
 no more stolen cars, why?

1:40:03.640 --> 1:40:07.160
 Who wants to keep this farce going?

1:40:07.160 --> 1:40:08.600
 They just perpetuating it.

1:40:08.600 --> 1:40:11.720
 Like, oh, every little police place

1:40:11.720 --> 1:40:15.440
 is getting all these suits and armor and machine guns.

1:40:15.440 --> 1:40:19.800
 It's just like, oh, it's such a spin, it's sad.

1:40:19.800 --> 1:40:22.000
 Do you think all drugs should be legalized?

1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.480
 I don't know about that,

1:40:24.480 --> 1:40:26.760
 but they certainly should be controlled.

1:40:26.760 --> 1:40:28.080
 If a person is an addict,

1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:32.200
 he should be able to go down and get his fix

1:40:32.200 --> 1:40:33.440
 with somebody there to help him

1:40:33.440 --> 1:40:36.000
 with a clean needle and a glass of orange juice.

1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:38.280
 It's so much cheaper than prison.

1:40:38.280 --> 1:40:40.800
 It's so much cheaper than him stealing cars

1:40:40.800 --> 1:40:42.840
 or a prostitute having to go to work.

1:40:42.840 --> 1:40:43.720
 That's sad.

1:40:44.600 --> 1:40:46.520
 You've lived one heck of a life.

1:40:47.880 --> 1:40:51.920
 Looking back, there's a lot of young people

1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:55.960
 that listen to this, high school, college students.

1:40:55.960 --> 1:40:57.680
 What advice would you give them?

1:40:57.680 --> 1:41:02.000
 How to live, how to have a successful career,

1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:05.960
 how to have a good life, how to be a good man or woman?

1:41:07.920 --> 1:41:09.440
 To be a good man or woman,

1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:12.520
 if I had it to do over with,

1:41:12.520 --> 1:41:14.200
 I'll just tell you what I'd have done.

1:41:14.200 --> 1:41:16.920
 I would have paid attention and studied my lesson

1:41:16.920 --> 1:41:18.320
 and did the best I could.

1:41:19.560 --> 1:41:21.320
 In school. In school, yes.

1:41:21.320 --> 1:41:23.080
 And went as far as I could have.

1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:24.480
 I would have liked to been a doctor.

1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:25.880
 I just didn't have the stickability

1:41:25.880 --> 1:41:29.760
 or anybody to tell me, hey, go over there and do that.

1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:32.800
 And if you can do that at a very young age,

1:41:32.800 --> 1:41:36.080
 start in a trade, learn to do something.

1:41:36.080 --> 1:41:38.240
 It doesn't matter what it is.

1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:40.320
 If you learn to do something good,

1:41:40.320 --> 1:41:42.680
 there is a great demand for you.

1:41:43.760 --> 1:41:46.000
 And I would say that in prison,

1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:47.880
 that the prison system should come in

1:41:47.880 --> 1:41:51.200
 and you get a thief, young fans of thief,

1:41:51.200 --> 1:41:56.200
 robber, and you say, all right, we need carpenters.

1:41:56.400 --> 1:41:57.240
 We need plumbers.

1:41:57.240 --> 1:41:58.080
 We need electricians.

1:41:58.080 --> 1:41:59.240
 We need sheep.

1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:02.080
 Sentence them to that trade.

1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:03.720
 And when you get an A plus in that,

1:42:03.720 --> 1:42:06.360
 where you can go out and make you $30 or $50 an hour,

1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:07.960
 you go home.

1:42:07.960 --> 1:42:10.480
 Now you can mess around 10 years if you want to,

1:42:10.480 --> 1:42:11.840
 or you can do this in two.

1:42:11.840 --> 1:42:14.760
 I think that's just for the prison.

1:42:14.760 --> 1:42:17.480
 But anyway, I would say that they find somebody

1:42:17.480 --> 1:42:19.000
 and be true to them.

1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:24.000
 That we have, just be honest and true in your life.

1:42:25.680 --> 1:42:27.720
 You mean like relationships, friendships?

1:42:27.720 --> 1:42:28.560
 Relationships, yes.

1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:31.320
 I mean, so many, so many people,

1:42:31.320 --> 1:42:34.840
 particularly our children, are from relationships

1:42:34.840 --> 1:42:37.960
 where they not wanted their divorce.

1:42:37.960 --> 1:42:38.840
 Their father's left.

1:42:38.840 --> 1:42:40.360
 They don't know who their daddy is.

1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:42.080
 They're just in foster homes.

1:42:42.080 --> 1:42:45.760
 500,000 children are in foster homes in America today.

1:42:45.760 --> 1:42:49.200
 And we have, and our government inadvertently

1:42:49.200 --> 1:42:51.400
 isn't encouraging those people.

1:42:51.400 --> 1:42:54.240
 My daughter is a doctor and she delivered a couple

1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:58.280
 of years ago a baby from a 10 year old child.

1:42:58.280 --> 1:43:00.480
 That child, and she said in the visiting room

1:43:00.480 --> 1:43:03.200
 is four generations, all of them on welfare.

1:43:03.200 --> 1:43:04.320
 Now we got one more.

1:43:04.320 --> 1:43:08.360
 And it reminds me of Elvis Presley's song, In the Ghetto.

1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:13.360
 So for an individual, learn a trade, become a craftsman,

1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:16.720
 learn a trade, become a craftsman of sorts,

1:43:16.720 --> 1:43:19.720
 and find somebody to love and who loves you.

1:43:19.720 --> 1:43:24.720
 That's right, have a family and stick with it.

1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:27.120
 Surely you're gonna get angry.

1:43:27.120 --> 1:43:28.240
 You're gonna get disappointed.

1:43:28.240 --> 1:43:29.400
 You're gonna get all kinds of stuff,

1:43:29.400 --> 1:43:33.240
 but come back and make up before you go to sleep.

1:43:33.240 --> 1:43:37.040
 Well, I did half of those things.

1:43:37.040 --> 1:43:38.960
 I got the first one and working on the second one.

1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:40.480
 So I appreciate the advice.

1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:45.320
 Well, Mari, thank you so much for joining us.

1:43:45.320 --> 1:43:47.920
 Can you tell me the story of how you two met?

1:43:47.920 --> 1:43:52.720
 Well, my parents every summer would go to the lake

1:43:52.720 --> 1:43:56.080
 in Canada and the place was called Turkey Point,

1:43:56.080 --> 1:44:00.040
 which is on Lake Erie, and just have a nice summer holiday

1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:03.640
 there, water skiing, swimming, sunbathing.

1:44:03.640 --> 1:44:06.760
 This was back in the 60s and I was sitting on the pier

1:44:06.760 --> 1:44:10.120
 with a few girlfriends and telling them my story.

1:44:10.120 --> 1:44:12.520
 And then all of a sudden I looked up

1:44:12.520 --> 1:44:17.520
 and I saw this figure in the distance coming onto the pier.

1:44:18.200 --> 1:44:21.240
 Now we're all dressed in bathing suits and swimwear.

1:44:21.240 --> 1:44:22.920
 We're swimming and this, that, and the other.

1:44:22.920 --> 1:44:25.480
 And here he comes, dark trousers.

1:44:25.480 --> 1:44:30.480
 In fact, they were black, white shirt and a tie

1:44:30.640 --> 1:44:34.040
 and a straw kind of a Panama hat.

1:44:34.040 --> 1:44:38.360
 And so he stood out.

1:44:38.360 --> 1:44:41.160
 And so I invited him to come and sit down.

1:44:41.160 --> 1:44:43.880
 And so he continued to talk and we just talked

1:44:43.880 --> 1:44:47.200
 and talked and talked and then later moved to the beach.

1:44:47.200 --> 1:44:50.320
 And I think the next time I saw him,

1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:53.080
 he was talking to another girl and I thought, yeah,

1:44:53.080 --> 1:44:58.080
 you know, I know, I was okay, okay, next.

1:44:58.560 --> 1:45:02.360
 Well, but six months later I receive a letter

1:45:02.360 --> 1:45:05.120
 and it's a letter from Roger.

1:45:05.120 --> 1:45:07.560
 And then we start this lovely correspondence

1:45:07.560 --> 1:45:10.000
 and we just start writing, you know, in those days,

1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:11.840
 you just wrote everything.

1:45:11.840 --> 1:45:16.120
 And then the next summer he was coming up again.

1:45:16.120 --> 1:45:20.640
 He was on his way to Alaska and he says,

1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:22.440
 I would like to come by and see you.

1:45:22.440 --> 1:45:24.160
 And I said, well, I'll be in the same place

1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:26.240
 that I met you last year.

1:45:26.240 --> 1:45:29.720
 And so when he came up this time,

1:45:29.720 --> 1:45:32.760
 for some reason Roger reached for my hand

1:45:32.760 --> 1:45:36.440
 and I reached for his and man, that was it.

1:45:36.440 --> 1:45:39.560
 It was like love at first touch.

1:45:39.560 --> 1:45:40.400
 That was love.

1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:44.640
 It was just like a silence, you know, and oh my gosh.

1:45:44.640 --> 1:45:47.440
 And we didn't even look at each other.

1:45:47.440 --> 1:45:50.200
 It was just, oh my goodness, what happened here?

1:45:50.200 --> 1:45:52.920
 And I was the type of person, I never wanted to get married,

1:45:52.920 --> 1:45:56.600
 not way, way, way down the road, never have any children.

1:45:56.600 --> 1:45:59.760
 And I wanted to see the world first and then do all that,

1:45:59.760 --> 1:46:02.280
 you know, and.

1:46:02.280 --> 1:46:03.800
 But that was it, that was love

1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:05.280
 and you've been together ever since.

1:46:05.280 --> 1:46:06.640
 Yeah.

1:46:06.640 --> 1:46:11.000
 Well, the thing is about the love

1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:13.240
 that the two of you have for each other

1:46:13.240 --> 1:46:16.740
 is it had to persevere through quite a heck of a journey.

1:46:17.940 --> 1:46:22.940
 So how did Roger's drug smuggling

1:46:23.640 --> 1:46:27.760
 change the nature of your love and your relationship?

1:46:27.760 --> 1:46:31.360
 Well, Lex, that remained steadfast.

1:46:31.360 --> 1:46:36.140
 It endured and since Roger's been home,

1:46:36.140 --> 1:46:39.240
 I think we've rekindled the love that we had

1:46:39.240 --> 1:46:40.920
 when we first met.

1:46:40.920 --> 1:46:42.320
 Yeah, what?

1:46:42.320 --> 1:46:46.840
 But I think my faith, you know, my faith,

1:46:46.840 --> 1:46:50.240
 my steadfast faith and also the fact

1:46:50.240 --> 1:46:51.960
 that Roger and I communicated.

1:46:51.960 --> 1:46:55.640
 We wrote letters, you know, he never complained.

1:46:55.640 --> 1:46:57.120
 I know there were the children there.

1:46:57.120 --> 1:46:58.800
 He never had mistreated me.

1:46:58.800 --> 1:47:02.080
 I love this guy and we had a lot of experiences.

1:47:02.080 --> 1:47:03.920
 It was just, even though I.

1:47:03.920 --> 1:47:06.040
 He's good looking, charismatic, he's pretty, you know.

1:47:06.040 --> 1:47:09.040
 Yeah, and he was adventurous, you know,

1:47:09.040 --> 1:47:12.960
 and I, would you say that again?

1:47:14.280 --> 1:47:18.440
 But yes, it was just, I know, you know,

1:47:18.440 --> 1:47:20.600
 I missed him physically, but he was just,

1:47:20.600 --> 1:47:24.640
 we were just so strong in spirit, you know,

1:47:24.640 --> 1:47:28.300
 and we could talk to one another.

1:47:28.300 --> 1:47:29.180
 Yep.

1:47:29.180 --> 1:47:33.920
 Well, what was it like, Roger, when you're a free man

1:47:35.200 --> 1:47:40.020
 seeing Mari for the first time in person again?

1:47:40.020 --> 1:47:42.080
 I cried for three days.

1:47:42.080 --> 1:47:44.160
 Everything, I had to look at a picture of her.

1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:48.120
 I came home and there she prepared a meal for me

1:47:49.200 --> 1:47:53.600
 and it was the old oak table that I'd redone

1:47:53.600 --> 1:47:57.160
 and the chairs, the same one, and the green placemats

1:47:57.160 --> 1:48:01.320
 and the same china that we had and the same silverware.

1:48:01.320 --> 1:48:03.200
 And it just, just all of it just brought back

1:48:03.200 --> 1:48:04.960
 the same paintings on the wall.

1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:06.000
 It was just like unbelievable.

1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:09.880
 After 35 years, she had all my clothes cleaned

1:48:09.880 --> 1:48:12.720
 and my shoes shining and I put the shoes on

1:48:12.720 --> 1:48:14.440
 and I walked out on the strings on this

1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:16.760
 and the soles came off, but the shirts

1:48:16.760 --> 1:48:18.480
 and all fit perfect and everything.

1:48:18.480 --> 1:48:19.880
 So it was just wonderful.

1:48:19.880 --> 1:48:22.800
 And just to see her and then just to think about,

1:48:22.800 --> 1:48:24.680
 see her picture of her 50th birthday

1:48:24.680 --> 1:48:28.320
 or her 60th birthday or her 70th birthday.

1:48:28.320 --> 1:48:30.000
 I wasn't there.

1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:31.440
 And the picture of her and with the children,

1:48:31.440 --> 1:48:33.160
 it just, it was heartbreaking.

1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:34.400
 And about the third day, I thought,

1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:37.320
 man up, fella, I mean, you've got to.

1:48:37.320 --> 1:48:42.320
 So I got over it and quit the tears.

1:48:42.400 --> 1:48:45.800
 It was, everything was just pulsating with life.

1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:48.800
 It was just unbelievable to get out of that place.

1:48:48.800 --> 1:48:49.980
 It really was.

1:48:49.980 --> 1:48:54.980
 Is there, do you regret the drug smuggling

1:48:57.900 --> 1:49:00.900
 that took you away from the woman you love?

1:49:00.900 --> 1:49:03.740
 Oh yes, 100%.

1:49:03.740 --> 1:49:08.340
 Just, you know, I wouldn't have done it again

1:49:08.340 --> 1:49:11.300
 if you don't think you're going to get caught.

1:49:11.300 --> 1:49:14.900
 And it's just, no, it's just, I did it for money

1:49:14.900 --> 1:49:16.380
 and I had everything in the world I wanted

1:49:16.380 --> 1:49:18.220
 before I did that.

1:49:18.220 --> 1:49:22.860
 So the adventure, I mean, it was one heck of an adventure

1:49:22.860 --> 1:49:25.220
 for the two of you, for the both of you.

1:49:25.220 --> 1:49:29.020
 Were you able to enjoy it or was it always danger?

1:49:29.020 --> 1:49:33.160
 Was it always something that threatened your relationship,

1:49:33.160 --> 1:49:35.660
 your love, your family?

1:49:35.660 --> 1:49:37.460
 Or were you able to enjoy the adventure of it?

1:49:37.460 --> 1:49:39.060
 You know, we'll all die.

1:49:39.060 --> 1:49:40.460
 Life is short.

1:49:40.460 --> 1:49:42.840
 And to live that kind of adventure.

1:49:42.840 --> 1:49:46.340
 Well, whenever I did the first loot, I got $10,000.

1:49:46.340 --> 1:49:48.540
 And that was just about, that was just about two years

1:49:48.540 --> 1:49:50.580
 pay on the fire department take home.

1:49:50.580 --> 1:49:52.380
 And I brought that home and.

1:49:52.380 --> 1:49:54.100
 I put my hand over my mouth.

1:49:54.100 --> 1:49:57.540
 I said, Roger, I can't believe this.

1:49:57.540 --> 1:50:00.980
 All the money and money like, oh my, what in the world?

1:50:00.980 --> 1:50:03.260
 Roger said, let's go have dinner.

1:50:03.260 --> 1:50:04.980
 And so we went to the little restaurant

1:50:04.980 --> 1:50:07.260
 that we would normally, we would go to, you know,

1:50:07.260 --> 1:50:09.140
 and he said, and don't you dare look

1:50:09.140 --> 1:50:11.420
 on the right hand side of the menu.

1:50:11.420 --> 1:50:13.940
 He said, just order anything you want.

1:50:13.940 --> 1:50:17.900
 And it was just, as we were in the restaurant, you know,

1:50:17.900 --> 1:50:19.820
 it was just, we were giddy about it.

1:50:20.700 --> 1:50:22.900
 Yeah, I was giddy about it.

1:50:22.900 --> 1:50:24.020
 And.

1:50:24.020 --> 1:50:27.700
 Were you afraid that, I mean, did you think about the fact

1:50:27.700 --> 1:50:32.700
 that it's illegal and Roger can end up in prison?

1:50:32.780 --> 1:50:34.180
 Oh, yes.

1:50:34.180 --> 1:50:35.580
 Did you guys talk about it?

1:50:36.460 --> 1:50:38.620
 Well, I just, I kind of thought I was bulletproof.

1:50:38.620 --> 1:50:39.940
 I mean, they didn't catch you.

1:50:39.940 --> 1:50:41.700
 I thought if they didn't catch you, you was all right.

1:50:41.700 --> 1:50:42.540
 And it was hard to get you.

1:50:42.540 --> 1:50:45.460
 It was hard to catch you in the air.

1:50:45.460 --> 1:50:48.020
 So you never thought, hard to catch you in the air.

1:50:48.020 --> 1:50:48.860
 I like it.

1:50:48.860 --> 1:50:52.420
 I didn't know that if your friend told on you

1:50:52.420 --> 1:50:54.580
 five years later, you'd still go to prison.

1:50:54.580 --> 1:50:55.660
 That was a problem.

1:50:55.660 --> 1:50:56.900
 I didn't know that.

1:50:56.900 --> 1:50:59.620
 Did you guys ever talk about walking away?

1:51:00.660 --> 1:51:03.380
 I asked Roger to walk away.

1:51:03.380 --> 1:51:06.700
 And he says, I can't, Mario, just now, you know.

1:51:06.700 --> 1:51:09.820
 And then of course, the amount of people

1:51:09.820 --> 1:51:14.540
 that he began to support, the family and the gifts and the.

1:51:14.540 --> 1:51:15.380
 The deals.

1:51:15.380 --> 1:51:17.700
 The deals, yes, the deals.

1:51:17.700 --> 1:51:18.540
 Big ones.

1:51:18.540 --> 1:51:20.580
 Yes, and then you always want to do,

1:51:20.580 --> 1:51:22.860
 what do you do with the money?

1:51:22.860 --> 1:51:26.620
 So you want to, I guess you clean it up

1:51:26.620 --> 1:51:31.020
 or you want to invest in an enterprise or in a business.

1:51:31.020 --> 1:51:33.060
 Well, it just doesn't work.

1:51:33.060 --> 1:51:35.620
 They know the source of it and they take it and run.

1:51:37.420 --> 1:51:38.380
 Every one of them.

1:51:38.380 --> 1:51:39.460
 Yeah.

1:51:39.460 --> 1:51:40.300
 Yeah.

1:51:40.300 --> 1:51:42.940
 But he was very generous, extremely generous

1:51:42.940 --> 1:51:45.100
 and benevolent and.

1:51:45.100 --> 1:51:48.180
 And when I started, I would ask about,

1:51:48.180 --> 1:51:52.100
 I went to a lawyer and a good number of people

1:51:52.100 --> 1:51:55.140
 in California at that time wanted to legalize marijuana

1:51:55.140 --> 1:51:57.300
 back in 1973.

1:51:57.300 --> 1:51:58.740
 And I went to a lawyer and I says,

1:51:58.740 --> 1:52:00.820
 Mr. Lawyer, I put $100 on to say,

1:52:00.820 --> 1:52:03.180
 what would they do if I caught me

1:52:03.180 --> 1:52:04.660
 bringing marijuana across the border?

1:52:04.660 --> 1:52:07.860
 He said, if you have a criminal record, I said, no,

1:52:07.860 --> 1:52:10.820
 I've never had a speeding ticket, nothing,

1:52:10.820 --> 1:52:12.700
 not even a traffic ticket.

1:52:12.700 --> 1:52:15.020
 I said, he said, you work for the fire department?

1:52:15.020 --> 1:52:15.860
 I said, no sir.

1:52:15.860 --> 1:52:16.900
 I said, yes, sir.

1:52:16.900 --> 1:52:18.940
 He said, you'll get probation.

1:52:18.940 --> 1:52:22.140
 The worst you'll do is you'll get one year

1:52:22.140 --> 1:52:24.020
 and you'll spend four months raking leaves

1:52:24.020 --> 1:52:25.780
 on a military base.

1:52:25.780 --> 1:52:28.100
 So my mother and my father died some years before

1:52:28.100 --> 1:52:30.060
 and I brought mother and baby sister came out

1:52:30.060 --> 1:52:31.860
 and I took them down to Disneyland

1:52:31.860 --> 1:52:33.940
 and she said, what you doing, boy?

1:52:33.940 --> 1:52:35.940
 I said, I'm hauling pot, mom.

1:52:35.940 --> 1:52:36.780
 She said, how much you making?

1:52:36.780 --> 1:52:39.220
 I said, I'm making $40,000 any day I want to go.

1:52:40.180 --> 1:52:41.500
 And she said, what do they do if they catch you?

1:52:41.500 --> 1:52:43.580
 And I told her, what the lawyer said.

1:52:43.580 --> 1:52:45.260
 Four months at the most raking leaves,

1:52:45.260 --> 1:52:46.500
 that's what do you think?

1:52:46.500 --> 1:52:48.620
 She said, do you need a copilot, son?

1:52:48.620 --> 1:52:51.260
 Yeah, money is money, yeah.

1:52:54.480 --> 1:52:59.480
 So your relationship persevered through some big challenges.

1:53:00.700 --> 1:53:04.380
 Is there advice you can give about what makes

1:53:04.380 --> 1:53:07.240
 for a successful relationship?

1:53:07.240 --> 1:53:12.240
 Oh, well, you know, I think the initial igniting,

1:53:13.420 --> 1:53:17.140
 meeting someone, you know, that's the love.

1:53:17.140 --> 1:53:17.980
 That's it.

1:53:17.980 --> 1:53:22.420
 And that little fire, that fire just keeps burning

1:53:22.420 --> 1:53:23.860
 and burning and burning.

1:53:23.860 --> 1:53:26.300
 You can't put it out no matter what.

1:53:26.300 --> 1:53:28.880
 It's the love fire.

1:53:29.820 --> 1:53:31.500
 But it gets difficult.

1:53:31.500 --> 1:53:33.560
 It's funny, the love fire.

1:53:33.560 --> 1:53:35.620
 So you're saying the love fire is all it takes

1:53:35.620 --> 1:53:37.180
 to persevere through the difficulty.

1:53:37.180 --> 1:53:40.780
 Well, no, well, that's a huge part of it.

1:53:40.780 --> 1:53:44.980
 And also I contribute my individual situation

1:53:44.980 --> 1:53:49.980
 to in order to endure the prison years is my faith.

1:53:52.300 --> 1:53:53.140
 Faith in God?

1:53:53.140 --> 1:53:53.980
 Yes.

1:53:54.980 --> 1:53:58.940
 And friends who were unconditionally still loved me

1:53:58.940 --> 1:54:02.100
 no matter what, yes.

1:54:02.100 --> 1:54:05.260
 So you had love around you in general.

1:54:05.260 --> 1:54:07.780
 I did, and my children.

1:54:07.780 --> 1:54:11.780
 They, you know, and that was a real purpose

1:54:11.780 --> 1:54:13.900
 to guide them and to love them

1:54:13.900 --> 1:54:17.660
 and to help them become citizens.

1:54:19.380 --> 1:54:20.740
 What about you, Roger?

1:54:20.740 --> 1:54:22.780
 What advice would you give?

1:54:22.780 --> 1:54:23.620
 I just don't know how to do it,

1:54:23.620 --> 1:54:26.540
 but I do know that you have to work on a relationship.

1:54:26.540 --> 1:54:27.960
 Mara and I's had problems.

1:54:27.960 --> 1:54:28.800
 I mean, we get really.

1:54:28.800 --> 1:54:29.900
 You guys get in fights?

1:54:29.900 --> 1:54:30.740
 Oh, yeah.

1:54:30.740 --> 1:54:34.180
 That's pretty regular, but not,

1:54:34.180 --> 1:54:36.500
 they don't let them last long, you know,

1:54:36.500 --> 1:54:38.700
 but certainly we are so different.

1:54:38.700 --> 1:54:42.100
 We're the same, and yet we're so different, yeah.

1:54:42.100 --> 1:54:43.080
 Like little stuff?

1:54:43.080 --> 1:54:45.020
 Little stuff, yes.

1:54:45.020 --> 1:54:48.140
 And it might be big, but I usually win her over, you know?

1:54:49.420 --> 1:54:53.500
 But anyhow, I just feel like Mara was always there.

1:54:53.500 --> 1:54:55.900
 It was like she was my anchor.

1:54:55.900 --> 1:54:57.360
 I was coming home.

1:54:57.360 --> 1:54:59.700
 I was always coming home to her and the children.

1:54:59.700 --> 1:55:01.780
 And you can see throughout my life,

1:55:01.780 --> 1:55:03.860
 I'm working on getting there.

1:55:03.860 --> 1:55:05.660
 Are you afraid for his life, by the way?

1:55:05.660 --> 1:55:06.740
 Oh, yes.

1:55:06.740 --> 1:55:08.680
 Oh, yeah, there are times, yeah.

1:55:08.680 --> 1:55:11.420
 But you know, I had faith in him.

1:55:11.420 --> 1:55:13.420
 He was an excellent pilot.

1:55:13.420 --> 1:55:14.720
 For example, I always said,

1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:16.860
 Roger, if the ship's going down,

1:55:16.860 --> 1:55:18.660
 I'm jumping in the lifeboat with you

1:55:18.660 --> 1:55:20.620
 because I know we're going to get to shore.

1:55:20.620 --> 1:55:21.660
 You will save us.

1:55:21.660 --> 1:55:25.060
 And so I had that faith in him, you know?

1:55:25.060 --> 1:55:27.920
 I mean, he's a man, but yet he's the one

1:55:27.920 --> 1:55:29.780
 you want to get into the lifeboat with.

1:55:29.780 --> 1:55:30.880
 Definitely.

1:55:30.880 --> 1:55:34.460
 But then there is, you know, Pablo Escobar,

1:55:34.460 --> 1:55:37.220
 one of the most dangerous humans in history,

1:55:37.220 --> 1:55:39.140
 plus the U.S. government.

1:55:39.140 --> 1:55:40.300
 Yep.

1:55:40.300 --> 1:55:41.300
 Worst by far.

1:55:43.300 --> 1:55:46.500
 Very difficult, very difficult to get away.

1:55:48.180 --> 1:55:52.740
 In terms of your faith, how has your faith helped you

1:55:52.740 --> 1:55:55.220
 to be the woman you are in this relationship

1:55:55.220 --> 1:55:58.980
 and seeing love the way you see it?

1:55:59.980 --> 1:56:02.620
 Well, I think my faith gives me hope.

1:56:02.620 --> 1:56:04.380
 I have lots of hope.

1:56:04.380 --> 1:56:09.380
 It helps me to dwell on the good side.

1:56:09.420 --> 1:56:12.660
 You know, when I ever meet someone

1:56:12.660 --> 1:56:14.820
 and there's some negative,

1:56:14.820 --> 1:56:17.300
 I try to see why they are like that

1:56:17.300 --> 1:56:19.300
 or what's the source of all that.

1:56:19.300 --> 1:56:22.500
 And I try to pull out the good.

1:56:22.500 --> 1:56:23.420
 I really do.

1:56:23.420 --> 1:56:24.900
 Not that I'm a goody goody,

1:56:24.900 --> 1:56:26.540
 but that's what your faith does.

1:56:26.540 --> 1:56:29.820
 You know, you see them as God sees us.

1:56:29.820 --> 1:56:30.660
 You know?

1:56:31.540 --> 1:56:33.380
 How has he changed over the years?

1:56:33.380 --> 1:56:34.220
 Roger?

1:56:34.220 --> 1:56:35.060
 Yeah.

1:56:35.060 --> 1:56:36.180
 He's still the same.

1:56:36.180 --> 1:56:38.020
 Actually, I like him better now.

1:56:39.380 --> 1:56:40.540
 He's a little calmer.

1:56:40.540 --> 1:56:41.660
 Yeah, that's crazy.

1:56:41.660 --> 1:56:42.860
 Oh, yes.

1:56:42.860 --> 1:56:45.100
 And happy to be, you know, at home,

1:56:45.100 --> 1:56:48.340
 or he'll say, Mari, I am just so happy

1:56:48.340 --> 1:56:51.040
 to be with you here in this condominium.

1:56:51.040 --> 1:56:51.900
 I'm content.

1:56:51.900 --> 1:56:55.020
 Because I used to call him my homing pigeon.

1:56:55.020 --> 1:56:56.340
 I just have to let him fly.

1:56:56.340 --> 1:56:58.540
 I couldn't, you know, he has to fly,

1:56:58.540 --> 1:56:59.900
 but he always came home.

1:57:02.720 --> 1:57:06.900
 Do you think about the end of this ride, our mortality?

1:57:06.900 --> 1:57:08.300
 Do you think about your death?

1:57:08.300 --> 1:57:09.660
 I do.

1:57:09.660 --> 1:57:13.820
 Particularly, I'm going to have a heart valve replacement

1:57:13.820 --> 1:57:18.260
 in about seven days where I could not make it.

1:57:18.260 --> 1:57:20.060
 You know, it's a very serious operation.

1:57:20.060 --> 1:57:22.980
 And I think about that very much.

1:57:22.980 --> 1:57:26.700
 And I ask for peace.

1:57:26.700 --> 1:57:31.300
 I just lost my brother about 10 days ago, so unexpectedly.

1:57:31.300 --> 1:57:33.300
 And that really put, you know,

1:57:33.300 --> 1:57:35.860
 makes you think of your mortality.

1:57:35.860 --> 1:57:36.700
 Are you afraid?

1:57:38.580 --> 1:57:41.360
 Somewhat, and yet not.

1:57:42.980 --> 1:57:43.860
 Yeah.

1:57:43.860 --> 1:57:45.220
 I want to live, Lex.

1:57:45.220 --> 1:57:48.100
 I want to live, you know?

1:57:48.100 --> 1:57:49.140
 This life is fun.

1:57:49.140 --> 1:57:50.540
 Yes.

1:57:50.540 --> 1:57:52.540
 Do you think about your death, Roger?

1:57:52.540 --> 1:57:53.700
 I have visions.

1:57:54.780 --> 1:57:57.900
 Visions, and they often happen very, very clear,

1:57:57.900 --> 1:58:00.500
 like what I have seen in the future.

1:58:00.500 --> 1:58:02.060
 Scientists might call it wormholes,

1:58:02.060 --> 1:58:05.140
 or in the Old Testament they called it prophets,

1:58:05.140 --> 1:58:08.240
 but I see sometimes into the future around the corner.

1:58:08.240 --> 1:58:10.060
 It's clear as we're sitting right here.

1:58:10.060 --> 1:58:11.700
 What's that look like?

1:58:11.700 --> 1:58:12.540
 I was on a porch,

1:58:12.540 --> 1:58:14.980
 and I believe I was in like Central America place.

1:58:14.980 --> 1:58:18.220
 I was an old man with khaki pants and a white shirt.

1:58:18.220 --> 1:58:22.140
 And it was a chair with a wide arms, and it was straight,

1:58:22.140 --> 1:58:25.180
 and there was like the beams coming out above my head,

1:58:25.180 --> 1:58:26.340
 and I'm on a porch.

1:58:26.340 --> 1:58:27.660
 Bokunbi, yeah.

1:58:27.660 --> 1:58:32.660
 And I come, I have out of the body experiences also.

1:58:33.340 --> 1:58:35.100
 And I came out of my body,

1:58:35.100 --> 1:58:37.340
 just, I just floated out of my body,

1:58:37.340 --> 1:58:41.060
 and went into a veil, and like into a mist.

1:58:41.060 --> 1:58:43.820
 And I believe that's probably why it happened.

1:58:43.820 --> 1:58:47.180
 You talk about like it's in your past.

1:58:47.180 --> 1:58:48.020
 This is your future.

1:58:48.020 --> 1:58:49.120
 This is in my future.

1:58:50.340 --> 1:58:52.260
 But this is something he has seen,

1:58:52.260 --> 1:58:53.340
 you know, in the past. I've seen it in a vision.

1:58:53.340 --> 1:58:55.040
 Yeah, in a vision. No, I know, but it's funny,

1:58:55.040 --> 1:58:58.780
 just the tense you use, it happened,

1:58:58.780 --> 1:59:00.660
 and yet it's something that will happen.

1:59:00.660 --> 1:59:01.700
 Yes. Two.

1:59:01.700 --> 1:59:03.060
 Both are true.

1:59:03.060 --> 1:59:04.280
 It's just unbelievable that,

1:59:04.280 --> 1:59:07.620
 and I don't know how many people have it, but I have it.

1:59:07.620 --> 1:59:09.660
 I walked out of my body just like,

1:59:09.660 --> 1:59:11.080
 just where I could come up to you and look,

1:59:11.080 --> 1:59:12.180
 and set up on the radio.

1:59:12.180 --> 1:59:13.780
 I used to be at work on the railroad,

1:59:13.780 --> 1:59:15.180
 and I had them there.

1:59:15.180 --> 1:59:16.420
 How do you explain that?

1:59:16.420 --> 1:59:18.380
 What do you think, what the heck is going on

1:59:18.380 --> 1:59:20.540
 in this universe that's possible?

1:59:20.540 --> 1:59:23.180
 Oh, I don't know, but certainly,

1:59:23.180 --> 1:59:25.180
 certainly a phenomenon which has happened.

1:59:25.180 --> 1:59:28.580
 And there's a guy, Bill Monroe,

1:59:28.580 --> 1:59:30.140
 that wrote the book on it, Out of the Body.

1:59:30.140 --> 1:59:31.220
 He tells about it.

1:59:31.220 --> 1:59:35.860
 And who was the guy that writes The Alchemist?

1:59:35.860 --> 1:59:37.460
 Pablo Coelho.

1:59:37.460 --> 1:59:39.480
 He has them also, just like that.

1:59:39.480 --> 1:59:41.820
 And he tells about how it happens on him.

1:59:41.820 --> 1:59:43.180
 Mine happened differently.

1:59:43.180 --> 1:59:47.180
 But you certainly can come out of your body.

1:59:48.180 --> 1:59:51.440
 What do you think the meaning of this life is,

1:59:51.440 --> 1:59:55.860
 maybe from your faith,

1:59:55.860 --> 1:59:59.220
 but also from just the amazing adventure

1:59:59.220 --> 2:00:00.880
 that you lived through?

2:00:00.880 --> 2:00:03.500
 How do you make sense of why the heck we're here?

2:00:05.380 --> 2:00:06.900
 I don't know.

2:00:06.900 --> 2:00:08.940
 It's just kind of like who you are.

2:00:08.940 --> 2:00:11.020
 Even when I was a child, I was like,

2:00:11.020 --> 2:00:12.620
 I'm different from other people.

2:00:12.620 --> 2:00:15.140
 You know?

2:00:15.140 --> 2:00:19.900
 And just as a boy, I was, like I had a...

2:00:19.900 --> 2:00:22.000
 Could you put into words how you were different

2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:22.840
 or it was just the feeling?

2:00:22.840 --> 2:00:24.700
 Yeah, like my brother, I mean,

2:00:24.700 --> 2:00:27.280
 he kept his hands clean and his shoes shining.

2:00:27.280 --> 2:00:29.460
 Here I was barefooted catching a wild hog

2:00:29.460 --> 2:00:32.820
 or a rattle on a horse trying to get it down.

2:00:32.820 --> 2:00:36.260
 I saw pictures of you climbing a tree recently.

2:00:36.260 --> 2:00:37.880
 When I first got out of prison,

2:00:37.880 --> 2:00:39.340
 always something like that.

2:00:40.580 --> 2:00:41.780
 So I don't know.

2:00:41.780 --> 2:00:46.220
 It's just that, and I noticed that something about me

2:00:46.220 --> 2:00:49.420
 is sometimes in prison, there'd be a knife fight.

2:00:49.420 --> 2:00:51.780
 And people just, you see them rough guys

2:00:51.780 --> 2:00:53.880
 that turn white from it.

2:00:55.220 --> 2:00:56.920
 I just kind of almost like smile.

2:00:56.920 --> 2:01:01.180
 I mean, if they come at me, I turn white and get away.

2:01:01.180 --> 2:01:02.740
 But it doesn't bother, those things,

2:01:02.740 --> 2:01:03.780
 they still didn't bother me.

2:01:03.780 --> 2:01:05.560
 I just, prison didn't bother me.

2:01:06.580 --> 2:01:08.220
 So you don't know what the heck the meaning is.

2:01:08.220 --> 2:01:10.540
 You just know you're a bit different than the others.

2:01:10.540 --> 2:01:11.380
 Yeah, I might be a little bit kooky.

2:01:11.380 --> 2:01:16.380
 Well, maybe the whole point is you want to realize,

2:01:18.100 --> 2:01:21.340
 you want to let that madness flourish,

2:01:21.340 --> 2:01:23.320
 that uniqueness flourish.

2:01:23.320 --> 2:01:24.300
 That's the whole point of life.

2:01:24.300 --> 2:01:25.700
 We're all different in our,

2:01:25.700 --> 2:01:28.100
 in very interesting little ways.

2:01:28.100 --> 2:01:30.580
 And the more different you are, you want to let that,

2:01:30.580 --> 2:01:33.780
 you want to let that become, you want to let it be its full.

2:01:33.780 --> 2:01:37.380
 It's like a garden, all the different flowers.

2:01:37.380 --> 2:01:39.620
 You did mention you weren't sure

2:01:39.620 --> 2:01:41.260
 if there's a free will or not.

2:01:42.500 --> 2:01:44.620
 Do you think it's all predetermined?

2:01:44.620 --> 2:01:45.460
 Or do you think we make our choices?

2:01:45.460 --> 2:01:47.300
 No, we definitely make our decisions.

2:01:47.300 --> 2:01:49.500
 I just said, if it is, I hope that,

2:01:49.500 --> 2:01:51.260
 but I know that we make our decisions.

2:01:51.260 --> 2:01:52.580
 Yes, I agree.

2:01:52.580 --> 2:01:55.140
 And I know that we are spirits

2:01:55.140 --> 2:01:57.340
 that are living in this flesh.

2:01:57.340 --> 2:01:59.760
 That's beyond a shadow of a doubt for me.

2:01:59.760 --> 2:02:00.940
 If you walk out of your body

2:02:00.940 --> 2:02:03.280
 and have out of body experience, you will know it.

2:02:03.280 --> 2:02:05.700
 So the body is just the temporary container

2:02:05.700 --> 2:02:06.540
 for something much bigger.

2:02:06.540 --> 2:02:09.420
 The spirit lives on eternally with no beginning and no end.

2:02:09.420 --> 2:02:11.620
 And that's hard to fathom.

2:02:11.620 --> 2:02:12.980
 Yeah, this is just a little,

2:02:12.980 --> 2:02:16.140
 this is a shell to contain that spirit.

2:02:16.140 --> 2:02:18.620
 This is the way we work on earth.

2:02:18.620 --> 2:02:20.100
 But yeah, I know it.

2:02:20.100 --> 2:02:21.740
 I'm an eternal being.

2:02:21.740 --> 2:02:22.580
 So are you.

2:02:22.580 --> 2:02:26.660
 Do you think there's a why to it?

2:02:26.660 --> 2:02:28.840
 Do you think there's a meaning to this life?

2:02:28.840 --> 2:02:32.520
 Well, I think the why is beyond my capability

2:02:32.520 --> 2:02:33.580
 of understanding.

2:02:33.580 --> 2:02:36.020
 It's someone greater than me.

2:02:36.020 --> 2:02:38.300
 I don't understand it,

2:02:38.300 --> 2:02:40.220
 but it's awesome.

2:02:40.220 --> 2:02:42.300
 I just know that it's awesome.

2:02:42.300 --> 2:02:44.180
 And one day we will know the answers.

2:02:44.180 --> 2:02:47.920
 Once we get to that crossover to the other side,

2:02:47.920 --> 2:02:50.420
 I think we will understand clearly.

2:02:50.420 --> 2:02:53.700
 It says, you know, now we see through a glass darkly,

2:02:53.700 --> 2:02:56.100
 but then when we are face to face with God,

2:02:56.100 --> 2:02:57.540
 we will understand.

2:02:58.460 --> 2:03:03.460
 And until we know, let's just enjoy this beautiful life

2:03:03.500 --> 2:03:04.340
 while we got it.

2:03:04.340 --> 2:03:05.180
 Absolutely.

2:03:05.180 --> 2:03:06.020
 And we're meant.

2:03:06.020 --> 2:03:06.900
 That was my gift.

2:03:06.900 --> 2:03:10.380
 I love everybody and everything I do.

2:03:10.380 --> 2:03:12.100
 And it just, and I'm sorry,

2:03:12.100 --> 2:03:14.440
 if I put a stumbling block in anybody's way,

2:03:14.440 --> 2:03:16.020
 I wouldn't want to,

2:03:16.020 --> 2:03:18.760
 but these are these things that when I just think about,

2:03:18.760 --> 2:03:23.520
 oh, what a hypocritical world we live in though.

2:03:24.800 --> 2:03:27.700
 Like most anybody, I'd say, listen, okay,

2:03:27.700 --> 2:03:28.780
 he's a drug dealer.

2:03:28.780 --> 2:03:31.380
 And I would say most of them had committed adultery.

2:03:31.380 --> 2:03:33.300
 That's a cardinal sin.

2:03:33.300 --> 2:03:38.300
 And yet they move, throw rocks at me for moving a marijuana,

2:03:38.420 --> 2:03:40.020
 cocaine across the road.

2:03:40.020 --> 2:03:40.860
 Yeah.

2:03:40.860 --> 2:03:42.500
 It's just, if you saw the two different things,

2:03:42.500 --> 2:03:45.760
 you'd say, what a terrible difference it is.

2:03:45.760 --> 2:03:49.220
 But we become conditioned with this mad society

2:03:49.220 --> 2:03:50.060
 that we have.

2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:56.020
 You mentioned that your daughter, Miriam, wrote you a poem.

2:03:56.020 --> 2:03:57.220
 Do you mind reading it?

2:03:57.220 --> 2:03:58.320
 I'd be glad to.

2:03:58.320 --> 2:04:02.100
 I was doing 11 years up in Lombok Penitentiary,

2:04:02.100 --> 2:04:05.460
 maximum security prison for parole violation

2:04:05.460 --> 2:04:08.120
 for possession of marijuana in 1977.

2:04:08.980 --> 2:04:10.200
 They should have given me six months,

2:04:10.200 --> 2:04:12.140
 but they gave me 11 years because they wanted me

2:04:12.140 --> 2:04:14.500
 for what they call silent beef.

2:04:14.500 --> 2:04:16.660
 Anyhow, while I was in that dungeon,

2:04:16.660 --> 2:04:19.920
 I received a letter from my daughter, Miriam.

2:04:21.260 --> 2:04:23.160
 It's called Daddy's Poem.

2:04:23.160 --> 2:04:27.580
 A year ago, I became a poet when I wrote your birthday prose.

2:04:27.580 --> 2:04:30.680
 And here I am today, ready to give it another go.

2:04:30.680 --> 2:04:35.140
 First, I would like to wish you a very happy birthday to be

2:04:35.140 --> 2:04:37.100
 and to thank you so very much

2:04:37.100 --> 2:04:39.740
 for without you, I would not be me.

2:04:39.740 --> 2:04:43.640
 Secondly, I want to say that your support has been immense.

2:04:43.640 --> 2:04:48.460
 It has been true, honest, loving, and free of all pretense.

2:04:48.460 --> 2:04:50.880
 Thirdly, it goes without saying,

2:04:50.880 --> 2:04:53.640
 your love has surpassed all my wrongs

2:04:53.640 --> 2:04:55.500
 and you always made me smile

2:04:55.500 --> 2:04:57.380
 with one of your old country songs.

2:04:57.380 --> 2:05:00.980
 I can remember on Cuervo, Daddy,

2:05:00.980 --> 2:05:02.840
 with you holding me in your arms,

2:05:02.840 --> 2:05:06.540
 as you sang Jim Reeves songs and talked about the farm.

2:05:06.540 --> 2:05:08.380
 I can see you walking through the door

2:05:08.380 --> 2:05:10.700
 from one of your travels far and wide

2:05:10.700 --> 2:05:12.600
 and the thought of you coming home, Daddy,

2:05:12.600 --> 2:05:15.060
 kept a twinkle in our eyes.

2:05:15.060 --> 2:05:18.900
 I can smell you as I did when I used to climb into your bed

2:05:18.900 --> 2:05:20.140
 and you would talk to me again

2:05:20.140 --> 2:05:22.780
 about one of the adventures that you led.

2:05:22.780 --> 2:05:24.600
 I can see me and Mario asleep

2:05:24.600 --> 2:05:27.420
 in one of your airplanes extraordinaire

2:05:27.420 --> 2:05:29.620
 and remembering wondering to myself

2:05:29.620 --> 2:05:32.460
 why there wasn't an available chair.

2:05:32.460 --> 2:05:34.100
 I remember having to meet you

2:05:34.100 --> 2:05:36.140
 and worrying that you wouldn't be there,

2:05:36.140 --> 2:05:38.740
 but you would pop from behind some counter

2:05:38.740 --> 2:05:40.580
 and give us all a happy scare.

2:05:41.760 --> 2:05:44.180
 You gave us presents in Key Biscayne

2:05:44.180 --> 2:05:46.300
 and hotels pleasure galore

2:05:46.300 --> 2:05:50.140
 and three dozen roses that we came through the airport door.

2:05:50.140 --> 2:05:53.660
 I can see your face in Amsterdam with the luggage carousel

2:05:53.660 --> 2:05:55.260
 and you look like a boy with a secret

2:05:55.260 --> 2:05:57.900
 that you were just dying to tell.

2:05:57.900 --> 2:06:01.420
 You taught me mathematics in the sands of far away places

2:06:01.420 --> 2:06:04.940
 and taught me to sail and we left without any traces.

2:06:04.940 --> 2:06:07.060
 We climbed glaciers in Argentina

2:06:07.060 --> 2:06:09.420
 and saw the blue of the beautiful caves

2:06:09.420 --> 2:06:14.200
 and witnessed the majestic beauty of such a juggling maze.

2:06:14.200 --> 2:06:17.560
 I learned how to change gears on the dirt roads of Brazil.

2:06:17.560 --> 2:06:21.940
 We ate hot dogs in Paraguay, a memory we smile over still.

2:06:21.940 --> 2:06:24.420
 We talked about lions, elephants and bears

2:06:24.420 --> 2:06:26.780
 on a Hacienda in Uruguay,

2:06:26.780 --> 2:06:30.020
 but decided it was better if the Europe we did fly.

2:06:30.020 --> 2:06:32.260
 Oh, the old world and all its luxury,

2:06:32.260 --> 2:06:34.580
 what a good time it was.

2:06:34.580 --> 2:06:37.040
 From South America to the Krosnopolsky,

2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:39.220
 I think we fell in love.

2:06:39.220 --> 2:06:44.220
 The European jaunt, well, it is considered a book in itself

2:06:44.340 --> 2:06:46.340
 but it's a story about beauty and knowledge,

2:06:46.340 --> 2:06:48.640
 suspense and worldly wealth.

2:06:48.640 --> 2:06:50.020
 We went from Holland to Sweden,

2:06:50.020 --> 2:06:52.180
 we went from France to Spain

2:06:52.180 --> 2:06:54.660
 and I promise you I have no regrets.

2:06:54.660 --> 2:06:57.420
 I would definitely do it all again.

2:06:57.420 --> 2:06:59.740
 I would see the world with you anytime, sir.

2:06:59.740 --> 2:07:01.660
 There's no doubt in my mind

2:07:01.660 --> 2:07:03.780
 because being by your side, daddy,

2:07:03.780 --> 2:07:06.940
 always ensures a wild good time.

2:07:06.940 --> 2:07:10.260
 So our paths took a turn and we're back in the US of A,

2:07:10.260 --> 2:07:13.340
 but life here isn't so bad and I'm plumb content to stay.

2:07:14.460 --> 2:07:16.100
 I'm happy to be near you,

2:07:16.100 --> 2:07:18.860
 although I'm not as close as I was before,

2:07:18.860 --> 2:07:21.100
 but because of your love and encouragement,

2:07:21.100 --> 2:07:23.640
 I've been able to open new doors.

2:07:23.640 --> 2:07:25.700
 I'm grateful to be in school

2:07:25.700 --> 2:07:28.420
 and I'm genuinely happy where I am.

2:07:28.420 --> 2:07:30.600
 And I even like when you call and tell me to study

2:07:30.600 --> 2:07:31.900
 for the next exam.

2:07:32.740 --> 2:07:34.860
 What a life you've given me, daddy.

2:07:34.860 --> 2:07:37.740
 It's a tremendous and a magical gift.

2:07:37.740 --> 2:07:40.020
 We already have so many stories to tell,

2:07:40.020 --> 2:07:42.340
 there are far too many to list.

2:07:42.340 --> 2:07:44.540
 But I want to thank you again this day

2:07:44.540 --> 2:07:47.180
 with a very big happy birthday to you

2:07:47.180 --> 2:07:49.340
 and to tell you just a few more things

2:07:49.340 --> 2:07:51.700
 that I knew in my heart to be true.

2:07:51.700 --> 2:07:52.860
 That I love you, daddy,

2:07:52.860 --> 2:07:55.380
 with all of your wrongs and your rights.

2:07:55.380 --> 2:07:56.700
 That you're ahead of our family

2:07:56.700 --> 2:07:59.300
 and you've kept us all bound tight.

2:07:59.300 --> 2:08:01.340
 That you have a honest love in your heart

2:08:01.340 --> 2:08:03.600
 for God and all mankind.

2:08:03.600 --> 2:08:05.620
 And you truly do believe in yourself

2:08:05.620 --> 2:08:08.340
 when you say it will all be fine.

2:08:08.340 --> 2:08:10.340
 I know you will be there to catch me

2:08:10.340 --> 2:08:12.660
 if ever I waver a slip

2:08:12.660 --> 2:08:16.460
 and I know I'd want you as captain on any sinking ship.

2:08:16.460 --> 2:08:19.020
 I also know a new chapter is written.

2:08:19.020 --> 2:08:21.660
 It's almost time to move on.

2:08:21.660 --> 2:08:23.220
 It's time to sail another sea

2:08:23.220 --> 2:08:25.620
 and to witness a brand new dawn.

2:08:25.620 --> 2:08:27.700
 It'd be good to see you at the helm again

2:08:27.700 --> 2:08:29.860
 as you point out our destination,

2:08:29.860 --> 2:08:32.140
 the laugh and dance on the upper deckers

2:08:32.140 --> 2:08:33.700
 while the boat glides through.

2:08:34.780 --> 2:08:36.780
 It'd be good to see you on the go

2:08:36.780 --> 2:08:39.060
 as I know you like to be

2:08:39.060 --> 2:08:42.540
 and to know you can open any door without any key.

2:08:43.440 --> 2:08:45.820
 But while we revel in our days together,

2:08:45.820 --> 2:08:47.960
 we will know better than to hurry

2:08:47.960 --> 2:08:50.780
 because as you told me many times,

2:08:50.780 --> 2:08:53.100
 life is an incredible journey.

2:08:54.500 --> 2:08:55.820
 Wow, that's beautiful.

2:08:57.700 --> 2:08:58.540
 Yeah.

2:08:58.540 --> 2:09:02.540
 Roger, I'm really honored that you would take the time

2:09:02.540 --> 2:09:06.700
 to visit me in Texas and to sit down and talk with me.

2:09:06.700 --> 2:09:07.660
 Thank you so much, Roger.

2:09:07.660 --> 2:09:08.500
 Thanks so much, Mary. Thank you.

2:09:08.500 --> 2:09:10.180
 Thank you, it was a pleasure.

2:09:10.180 --> 2:09:11.260
 It's been a real pleasure.

2:09:11.260 --> 2:09:12.180
 Yes.

2:09:12.180 --> 2:09:13.720
 Beautiful.

2:09:13.720 --> 2:09:16.260
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Roger Reeves

2:09:16.260 --> 2:09:20.740
 and thank you to Noom, Allform, ExpressVPN,

2:09:20.740 --> 2:09:23.240
 Four Sigmatic and 8sleep.

2:09:23.240 --> 2:09:26.940
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:09:26.940 --> 2:09:29.020
 And now let me leave you with some words

2:09:29.020 --> 2:09:31.220
 from Pablo Escobar.

2:09:31.220 --> 2:09:35.520
 All empires are created of blood and fire.
