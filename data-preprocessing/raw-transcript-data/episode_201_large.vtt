00:00.000 --> 00:06.640
 The following is a conversation with Konstantin Batygin, planetary astrophysicist at Caltech,

00:06.640 --> 00:13.140
 interested in, among other things, the search for the distant, the mysterious, Planet Nine,

00:13.140 --> 00:16.060
 in the outer regions of our solar system.

00:16.060 --> 00:21.920
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Squarespace, Literati, Onnit, and Ni.

00:21.920 --> 00:25.200
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:25.200 --> 00:30.160
 As a side note, let me say that our little sun is orbited by not just a few planets in

00:30.160 --> 00:36.200
 the planetary region, but trillions of objects in the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud that

00:36.200 --> 00:39.500
 extends over three light years out.

00:39.500 --> 00:45.280
 This to me is amazing, since Proxima Centauri, the closest star to our sun, is only 4.2 light

00:45.280 --> 00:50.280
 years away, and all of it is mostly covered in darkness.

00:50.280 --> 00:54.140
 When I get a chance to go out swimming in the ocean far from the shore, I'm sometimes

00:54.140 --> 00:59.800
 overcome by the terrifying and the exciting feeling of not knowing what's there in the

00:59.800 --> 01:00.800
 deep darkness.

01:00.800 --> 01:04.240
 That's how I feel about the edge of our solar system.

01:04.240 --> 01:09.720
 One day, I hope humans will travel there, or at the very least, AI systems that carry

01:09.720 --> 01:12.360
 the flame of human consciousness.

01:12.360 --> 01:19.120
 This is the Lux Friedman Podcast, and here's my conversation with Konstantin Batygin.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.400
 What is Planet Nine?

01:21.400 --> 01:28.200
 Planet Nine is an object that we believe lives in the solar system beyond the orbit of Neptune.

01:28.200 --> 01:36.480
 It orbits the sun with a period of about 10,000 years, and is about five Earth masses.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.660
 So that's a hypothesized object.

01:38.660 --> 01:41.920
 There's some evidence for this kind of object.

01:41.920 --> 01:44.180
 There's a bunch of different explanations.

01:44.180 --> 01:48.540
 Can you give like an overview of the planets in our solar system?

01:48.540 --> 01:50.160
 How many are there?

01:50.160 --> 01:53.720
 What do we know and not know about them at a high level?

01:53.720 --> 01:54.720
 All right.

01:54.720 --> 01:55.720
 That sounds like a good plan.

01:55.720 --> 02:01.500
 So look, the solar system basically is comprised of two parts, the inner and the outer solar

02:01.500 --> 02:02.500
 system.

02:02.500 --> 02:07.800
 The inner solar system has the planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.

02:07.800 --> 02:14.800
 Now Mercury is about 40% of the orbital separation of where the Earth is.

02:14.800 --> 02:25.160
 It's closer to the sun, Venus is about 70%, then Mars is about 160% further away from

02:25.160 --> 02:27.400
 the sun than is the Earth.

02:27.400 --> 02:33.680
 These planets that we, one of them we occupy, right, are pretty small, okay?

02:33.680 --> 02:40.880
 They're two leading order sort of heavily overgrown asteroids, if you will.

02:40.880 --> 02:46.920
 And this becomes evident when you move out further in the solar system and encounter

02:46.920 --> 02:53.880
 Jupiter, which is 316 Earth masses, right, 10 times the size.

02:53.880 --> 03:00.320
 You know, and Saturn is another huge one, 90 Earth masses at about 10 times the separation

03:00.320 --> 03:07.600
 from the sun as is the Earth, and then you have Uranus and Neptune at 20 and 30 respectively.

03:07.600 --> 03:15.560
 For a long time, that is where the kind of massive part of the solar system ended.

03:15.560 --> 03:22.760
 But what we've learned in the last 30 years is that beyond Neptune, there's this expansive

03:22.760 --> 03:27.560
 field of icy debris, a second icy asteroid belt in the solar system.

03:27.560 --> 03:33.880
 A lot of people have heard of the asteroid belt, which lives between Mars and Jupiter,

03:33.880 --> 03:34.880
 right?

03:34.880 --> 03:40.880
 That's a pretty common thing that people like to imagine and draw on lunch boxes and stuff.

03:40.880 --> 03:47.760
 But beyond Neptune, there's a much more massive and much more radially expansive field of

03:47.760 --> 03:48.760
 debris.

03:48.760 --> 03:54.840
 Pluto, by the way, it belongs to that second, you know, icy asteroid belt, which we call

03:54.840 --> 03:55.840
 the Kuiper belt.

03:55.840 --> 03:59.520
 It's just a big object within that population of bodies.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.280
 Wow, Pluto the planet.

04:01.280 --> 04:05.160
 Pluto the dwarf planet, the former planet, you know.

04:05.160 --> 04:07.920
 Why is Pluto not a planet anymore?

04:07.920 --> 04:09.400
 I mean, it's tiny.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.400
 We used to...

04:10.400 --> 04:12.400
 So size matters when it comes to planets.

04:12.400 --> 04:13.760
 Oh, 100%, 100%.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.980
 It's actually a fascinating story.

04:15.980 --> 04:22.400
 When Pluto was discovered in 1930, the reason it was discovered in the first place is because

04:22.400 --> 04:29.000
 astronomers at the time were looking for a seven Earth mass planet somewhere beyond Neptune.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.080
 It was hypothesized that such an object exists.

04:32.080 --> 04:38.080
 When they found something, they interpreted that as a seven Earth mass planet and immediately

04:38.080 --> 04:42.960
 revised its mass downward because they couldn't resolve the object with the telescope.

04:42.960 --> 04:47.640
 So it looked like just a point mass, you know, star rather than a physical disk.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.840
 They said, well, maybe it's not seven, maybe it's one, right?

04:50.840 --> 04:56.920
 And then, so over the next, you know, I guess 40 years, Pluto's mass kept getting revised

04:56.920 --> 05:04.400
 downwards, downwards, downwards until it was realized that it's like 500 times less massive

05:04.400 --> 05:05.400
 than the Earth.

05:05.400 --> 05:12.820
 I mean, like Pluto's surface area is almost perfectly equal to the surface area of Russia

05:12.820 --> 05:13.820
 actually.

05:13.820 --> 05:17.120
 And you know, Russia is big, but it's not a planet.

05:17.120 --> 05:20.400
 Well, I mean, actually we can touch more on that.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.640
 That's another discussion.

05:22.640 --> 05:29.040
 So in some sense, earlier in the century, Pluto represented kind of our ignorance about

05:29.040 --> 05:31.560
 the edges of the solar system.

05:31.560 --> 05:37.880
 And perhaps planet nine is the thing that represents our ignorance about now the modern

05:37.880 --> 05:41.360
 set of ignorances about the edges of our solar system.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.560
 That's a good way to put it.

05:42.560 --> 05:48.920
 By the way, just imagining this belt of astral debris at the edge of our solar system is

05:48.920 --> 05:49.920
 incredible.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.740
 Can you talk about it a little bit?

05:51.740 --> 05:56.280
 What is the Kuiper belt and what is the Oort cloud?

05:56.280 --> 05:57.280
 Yeah.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.280
 Okay.

05:58.280 --> 06:02.680
 So look, the simple way to think about it is that if you imagine, you know, Neptune's

06:02.680 --> 06:05.280
 orbit like a circle, right?

06:05.280 --> 06:14.880
 Kind of maybe a factor of one and a half, 1.3 times bigger on a radius of 1.3 times

06:14.880 --> 06:18.600
 bigger, you've got a whole collection of icy objects.

06:18.600 --> 06:26.200
 Most of these objects are sort of the size of Austin, you know, maybe a little bit smaller.

06:26.200 --> 06:36.120
 If you then zoom out and explore the orbits of the most long period Kuiper belt object,

06:36.120 --> 06:42.000
 these are the things that have the biggest orbits and take the longest time to go around

06:42.000 --> 06:49.600
 in, then what you find is that beyond a critical orbit size, beyond a critical orbit period,

06:49.600 --> 06:56.280
 which is about 4,000 years, you start to see weird structure, like all the orbits sort

06:56.280 --> 06:58.840
 of point into one direction.

06:58.840 --> 07:04.600
 And all the orbits are kind of tilted in the same way by about 20 degrees with respect

07:04.600 --> 07:05.600
 to Sun.

07:05.600 --> 07:11.160
 This is particularly pronounced in orbits that are not heavily affected by Neptune.

07:11.160 --> 07:17.880
 So there you start to see this weird dichotomy where they're objects which are stable, which

07:17.880 --> 07:22.320
 Neptune does not mess with gravitationally, and unstable objects.

07:22.320 --> 07:27.020
 The unstable objects are basically all over the place because they're being kicked around

07:27.020 --> 07:28.020
 by Neptune.

07:28.020 --> 07:33.360
 The stable orbits show this remarkable pattern of clustering.

07:33.360 --> 07:39.600
 We back, I guess, five years ago interpreted this pattern of clustering as a gravitational

07:39.600 --> 07:45.680
 one way sign, the existence of a planet in a distant planet, right?

07:45.680 --> 07:50.600
 Something that is shepherding and confining these orbits together.

07:50.600 --> 07:57.000
 Of course, right, you have to have some skepticism when you're talking about these things.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.760
 You have to ask the question of, okay, how statistically significant is this clustering?

08:01.760 --> 08:06.600
 And there are many authors that have indeed called that into question.

08:06.600 --> 08:11.920
 We have done our own analyses and basically, just like with all statistics where there's

08:11.920 --> 08:21.400
 kind of multiple ways to do the exercise, you can either ask the question of if I have

08:21.400 --> 08:27.380
 a telescope that has surveyed this part of the sky, what are the chances that I would

08:27.380 --> 08:30.320
 discover this clustering?

08:30.320 --> 08:36.000
 That basically tells you that you have zero confidence, right?

08:36.000 --> 08:40.100
 That does not give you a confident answer one way or another.

08:40.100 --> 08:45.240
 Another way to do the statistics, which is what we prefer to do, is to say we have a

08:45.240 --> 08:50.920
 whole night sky of discoveries in the Kuiper Belt, right?

08:50.920 --> 08:56.520
 And if we have some object over there, which has right ascension and declination, which

08:56.520 --> 09:01.660
 is a way to say it's there on the sky, and it has some brightness, that means somebody

09:01.660 --> 09:07.800
 looked over there and discovered an object, was able to discover an object of that brightness

09:07.800 --> 09:09.360
 or brighter.

09:09.360 --> 09:14.160
 Through that analysis, you can construct a whole map on the sky of kind of where all

09:14.160 --> 09:18.320
 of the surveys that have ever been done have collectively looked.

09:18.320 --> 09:25.560
 So if you do the exercise this way, the false alarm probability of the clustering on which

09:25.560 --> 09:28.720
 the Planet Nine hypothesis is built is about 0.4%.

09:28.720 --> 09:32.280
 Wow, okay, so there's a million questions here.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.320
 One, when you say bright objects, why are they bright?

09:35.320 --> 09:38.920
 Are we talking about actual objects within the Kuiper Belt or the stuff we see through

09:38.920 --> 09:39.920
 the Kuiper Belt?

09:39.920 --> 09:42.360
 This is the actual stuff we see in the Kuiper Belt.

09:42.360 --> 09:46.040
 The way you go about discovering Kuiper Belt objects is pretty easy.

09:46.040 --> 09:49.260
 I mean, it's easy in theory, right?

09:49.260 --> 09:50.620
 Hard in practice.

09:50.620 --> 09:54.640
 All you do is you take snapshots of the sky, right?

09:54.640 --> 09:59.240
 Use that direction, say, and take a high exposure snapshot.

09:59.240 --> 10:03.320
 Then you wait a night and you do it again, and then you wait another night and you do

10:03.320 --> 10:05.000
 it again.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.920
 Objects that are just random stars in the galaxy don't move on the sky, whereas objects

10:09.920 --> 10:11.980
 in the solar system will slowly move.

10:11.980 --> 10:17.640
 This is no different than if you're driving down the freeway, it looks like trees are

10:17.640 --> 10:19.920
 going by you faster than the clouds, right?

10:19.920 --> 10:21.600
 This is parallax.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.600
 That's it.

10:22.600 --> 10:27.440
 It's they're reflecting light off of the sun and it's going back and hitting this.

10:27.440 --> 10:31.480
 There's a little bit of a glimmer from the different objects that you can see based on

10:31.480 --> 10:32.760
 the reflection from the sun.

10:32.760 --> 10:36.140
 So like there's actual light, it's not darkness.

10:36.140 --> 10:37.140
 That's right.

10:37.140 --> 10:41.880
 These are just big icicles basically that are just reflecting sunlight back at you.

10:41.880 --> 10:47.840
 It's then easy to understand why it's so hard to discover them because light has to travel

10:47.840 --> 10:54.960
 to something like 40 times the distance between the earth and the sun and then get reflected

10:54.960 --> 10:55.960
 back.

10:55.960 --> 10:57.440
 Was that like an hour travel?

10:57.440 --> 10:58.880
 Yeah, that's right.

10:58.880 --> 11:04.720
 That's something like that because the earth to the sun is eight minutes, I believe.

11:04.720 --> 11:07.980
 Something in that order of magnitude.

11:07.980 --> 11:09.680
 So that's interesting.

11:09.680 --> 11:12.320
 So you have to account for all of that.

11:12.320 --> 11:18.360
 And then there's a huge amount of data, pixels that are coming from the pictures and you

11:18.360 --> 11:24.840
 have to integrate all of that together to paint a sort of like a high estimate of the

11:24.840 --> 11:25.840
 different objects.

11:25.840 --> 11:26.840
 Can you track them?

11:26.840 --> 11:27.840
 Can you be like, that's Bob?

11:27.840 --> 11:29.400
 Like, can you like?

11:29.400 --> 11:30.400
 Yes, exactly.

11:30.400 --> 11:33.720
 In fact, one of them is named Joe Biden.

11:33.720 --> 11:36.920
 I mean, I'm not like, this is not even a joke, right?

11:36.920 --> 11:38.400
 Is there a Trump one or no?

11:38.400 --> 11:39.400
 No, no.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.400
 Not yet.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.400
 I don't know.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.000
 I don't know for that.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.840
 But like the way it works is if you discover one, you right away get a license plate for

11:49.840 --> 11:51.040
 it.

11:51.040 --> 11:56.840
 So like the first four numbers is the first year that this object has appeared on, you

11:56.840 --> 12:00.000
 know, in the data set, if you will.

12:00.000 --> 12:06.920
 And then there's like this code that follows it, which basically tells you where in the

12:06.920 --> 12:08.160
 sky it is, right?

12:08.160 --> 12:13.640
 So one of the really interesting Kuiper Belt objects, which is very much part of the Planet

12:13.640 --> 12:20.760
 Nine story is called VP113, because Joe Biden was vice president at the time, you know,

12:20.760 --> 12:22.760
 got nicknamed Biden.

12:22.760 --> 12:23.760
 VP113?

12:23.760 --> 12:24.760
 Yeah.

12:24.760 --> 12:27.600
 He got nicknamed Biden.

12:27.600 --> 12:28.600
 Beautiful.

12:28.600 --> 12:32.720
 What's the fingerprint for any particular object?

12:32.720 --> 12:34.200
 Like how do you know it's the same one?

12:34.200 --> 12:38.480
 Or you just kind of like, yeah, from night to night, you take a picture, how do you know

12:38.480 --> 12:39.480
 it's the same object?

12:39.480 --> 12:40.480
 Yeah.

12:40.480 --> 12:45.120
 So the way you know is it appears in almost exactly the same part of the sky except for

12:45.120 --> 12:46.120
 move, but it moves.

12:46.120 --> 12:53.640
 But this is why actually you need at least three nights because oftentimes asteroids,

12:53.640 --> 13:02.300
 which are much closer to the earth, like will appear to move only slightly, but then on

13:02.300 --> 13:03.640
 the third night will move away.

13:03.640 --> 13:07.480
 So that third night is really there to detect acceleration.

13:07.480 --> 13:15.080
 Now the thing that I didn't really realize until, you know, I started observing together

13:15.080 --> 13:20.880
 with my partner in crime in all this, Mike Brown, is just the fact that for the first

13:20.880 --> 13:26.480
 year when you make these detections, the only thing you really know with confidence is where

13:26.480 --> 13:30.580
 it is on the night sky and how far away it is, okay?

13:30.580 --> 13:31.580
 That's it.

13:31.580 --> 13:38.600
 It's all about the orbit because over three days the object just moves so little, right?

13:38.600 --> 13:43.240
 That whole motion on the sky is entirely coming from motion of the earth, right?

13:43.240 --> 13:47.400
 So the earth is kind of the car, the object is the tree and you see it move.

13:47.400 --> 13:52.680
 So then to get some confident information about what its orbit looks like, you have

13:52.680 --> 13:56.640
 to come back a year later and then measure it again.

13:56.640 --> 13:57.640
 Oh, interesting.

13:57.640 --> 14:01.640
 So three nights then come back a year later and do another three nights so you get the

14:01.640 --> 14:07.560
 velocity of the acceleration from the three nights and then you have the maybe the additional

14:07.560 --> 14:08.560
 information.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.520
 Because an orbit is basically described by six parameters.

14:11.520 --> 14:17.180
 So you at least need six independent points, but in reality you need many more observations

14:17.180 --> 14:20.660
 to really pin down the orbit well.

14:20.660 --> 14:24.280
 And from that you're able to construct for that one particular object and orbit and then

14:24.280 --> 14:27.840
 there's of course, like how many objects are there?

14:27.840 --> 14:31.560
 There's like four ish thousand now.

14:31.560 --> 14:36.800
 But like the, in the future that could be like millions.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.040
 Oh sure, oh sure.

14:39.040 --> 14:43.720
 So in fact these things are hard to predict, but there's a new observatory called the Vera

14:43.720 --> 14:48.200
 Rubin Observatory, which is coming online maybe next year.

14:48.200 --> 14:53.280
 I mean with COVID these things are a little bit more uncertain, but they've actually been

14:53.280 --> 14:56.340
 making great progress with construction.

14:56.340 --> 15:04.200
 And so that telescope is just going to sort of scan the night sky every day automatically

15:04.200 --> 15:11.820
 and just, it's such an efficient survey that it might increase the census of the distant

15:11.820 --> 15:15.600
 Kuiper Belt, the things that I'm interested in by a factor of a hundred.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.200
 I mean that would be, that would be really cool.

15:18.200 --> 15:22.520
 And yeah, that's a, that's an incredible...

15:22.520 --> 15:26.480
 I mean they might just find planet nine.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.480
 I mean that's...

15:27.480 --> 15:29.720
 Like almost like literally pictures, like visually.

15:29.720 --> 15:30.720
 I mean, sure.

15:30.720 --> 15:31.720
 Yeah.

15:31.720 --> 15:34.280
 Like the first detection you make, all you know is where it is in the sky and how far

15:34.280 --> 15:35.280
 away it is.

15:35.280 --> 15:39.800
 If something is, you know, 500 times away from the sun, as far away from the sun as

15:39.800 --> 15:42.200
 is the earth, you know that's planet nine.

15:42.200 --> 15:45.920
 That's when the story concludes and then you can study it.

15:45.920 --> 15:46.920
 Now you can study it.

15:46.920 --> 15:47.920
 Yeah.

15:47.920 --> 15:51.760
 By the way, I'm going to use that as like, I don't know, a pickup line or a dating strategy,

15:51.760 --> 15:56.720
 like see the person for three days and then don't see them at all and then see them again

15:56.720 --> 15:59.040
 in a year to determine the orbit.

15:59.040 --> 16:06.000
 And over time you figure out if sort of from a cosmic perspective, this, this whole thing

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
 works.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
 Yeah.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.600
 I have no dating advice to give.

16:09.600 --> 16:16.000
 I was going to use this as a metaphor to somehow map it onto the human condition.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
 Okay.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
 You mentioned the Kuiper Belt.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
 What's the Oort cloud?

16:19.000 --> 16:25.800
 If you look at the Neptune orbit as a one, then the Kuiper Belt is like 1.3 out there

16:25.800 --> 16:28.560
 and then we get farther and farther into the darkness.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.560
 What's the Oort cloud?

16:29.560 --> 16:36.320
 So okay, you've got the kind of main Kuiper Belt, which is about say 1.3, 1.5.

16:36.320 --> 16:40.960
 Then you have something called the scattered disc, which is kind of an extension of the

16:40.960 --> 16:41.960
 Kuiper Belt.

16:41.960 --> 16:48.480
 It's a bunch of these long, very elliptical orbits that hug the orbit of Neptune, but

16:48.480 --> 16:50.320
 come out very far.

16:50.320 --> 16:58.560
 So that, the scattered disc with the current senses, like the, some of the longest orbits

16:58.560 --> 17:04.760
 we know of have a semi major axis.

17:04.760 --> 17:10.080
 So half the orbit length, roughly speaking of about a thousand, thousand times the distance

17:10.080 --> 17:12.320
 between the earth and the sun.

17:12.320 --> 17:21.840
 Now if you keep moving out, okay, eventually once you're at sort of 10,000 to 100,000 roughly,

17:21.840 --> 17:23.160
 that's where the Oort cloud is.

17:23.160 --> 17:30.120
 Now the Oort cloud is a distinct population of icy bodies and is distinct from the Kuiper

17:30.120 --> 17:31.120
 Belt.

17:31.120 --> 17:39.240
 In fact, it's so expansive that it ends roughly halfway between us and the next star.

17:39.240 --> 17:45.360
 It's edge is just dictated by to what extent does the solar gravity reach.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.600
 Solar gravity reaches that far?

17:47.600 --> 17:55.060
 So it has to, wow, imagining this is a little bit overwhelming.

17:55.060 --> 18:03.560
 So there's like a giant, like vast icy rock thingy.

18:03.560 --> 18:04.560
 It's like a sphere.

18:04.560 --> 18:12.360
 It's like, it's an almost spherical structure that engulfs, that encircles the sun and all

18:12.360 --> 18:16.360
 the long period comets come from the Oort cloud.

18:16.360 --> 18:21.440
 They come, the way that they appear, I mean, for already, I don't know, hundreds of years

18:21.440 --> 18:28.440
 we've been detecting and occasionally like a comet will come in and it seemingly comes

18:28.440 --> 18:29.640
 out of nowhere.

18:29.640 --> 18:36.320
 The reason these long period comets appear on very, very long timescales, right?

18:36.320 --> 18:42.400
 These Oort cloud objects that are sitting 30,000 times as far away from the sun as is

18:42.400 --> 18:48.020
 the earth actually interact with the gravity of the galaxy, the tide, effectively the tide

18:48.020 --> 18:53.680
 that the galaxy exerts upon them and their orbits slowly change and they elongate to

18:53.680 --> 19:01.160
 the point where once they, their closest approach to the sun starts to reach a critical distance

19:01.160 --> 19:07.080
 where ice starts to sublimate, then we discover them as comets because then the ice comes

19:07.080 --> 19:08.280
 off of them.

19:08.280 --> 19:13.520
 They look beautiful in the night sky, et cetera, but they're all coming from really, really

19:13.520 --> 19:14.520
 far away.

19:14.520 --> 19:19.240
 So is there, are any of them coming our way from collisions?

19:19.240 --> 19:22.840
 Like how many collisions are there or is there a bunch of space for them to move around?

19:22.840 --> 19:24.080
 Yeah, there's zero.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.080
 It's completely collisionless out there.

19:27.080 --> 19:33.120
 The physical radii of objects are so small compared to the distance between them, right?

19:33.120 --> 19:38.400
 It's just, it is truly a collisionless environment.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.720
 I don't know.

19:39.720 --> 19:46.920
 I think that probably in the age of the solar system have literally been zero collisions

19:46.920 --> 19:48.480
 in the Oort cloud.

19:48.480 --> 19:49.480
 Wow.

19:49.480 --> 19:53.880
 So if you like draw a picture of the solar system, everything's really close together.

19:53.880 --> 19:57.720
 So everything I guess here is spaced far apart.

19:57.720 --> 20:01.420
 Do rogue planets like fly in every once in a while and join?

20:01.420 --> 20:04.000
 Not rogue planets, but rogue objects from out there.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
 Oh sure.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
 Oh sure.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
 Yeah.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
 Join the party?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
 Yeah, absolutely.

20:09.000 --> 20:15.200
 We've seen a couple of them in the last three or so years, maybe four years now.

20:15.200 --> 20:22.060
 The first one was the one called Uamuamua and it's been all over the news.

20:22.060 --> 20:28.600
 The second one was Comet Borisov discovered by a guy named Borisov.

20:28.600 --> 20:35.960
 Yeah, so the way you know they're coming from elsewhere is unlike solar system objects which

20:35.960 --> 20:42.060
 travel on elliptical paths around the sun, these guys travel on hyperbolic paths.

20:42.060 --> 20:45.200
 So they come in, say hello and then they're gone.

20:45.200 --> 20:52.920
 And the fact that they exist is totally like not surprising, right?

20:52.920 --> 20:59.960
 The Neptune is constantly ejecting Kuiper belt objects into interstellar space.

20:59.960 --> 21:05.600
 Our solar system itself is sort of leaking icy debris and ejecting it.

21:05.600 --> 21:11.920
 So presumably every planetary systems around other stars do exactly the same thing.

21:11.920 --> 21:17.120
 Let me ask you about the millions of objects that are part of the Kuiper belt and part

21:17.120 --> 21:18.120
 of the Oort cloud.

21:18.120 --> 21:20.240
 Do you think some of them have primitive life?

21:20.240 --> 21:25.480
 It kind of makes you sad if there's like primitive life there and they're just kind of like lonely

21:25.480 --> 21:26.480
 out there in space.

21:26.480 --> 21:27.480
 Yeah.

21:27.480 --> 21:30.160
 Like how many of them do you think have life, like bacterial life?

21:30.160 --> 21:32.000
 Probably a negligible amount.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.160
 Zero with like a plus on top.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.160
 Right.

21:36.160 --> 21:37.160
 Zero plus plus.

21:37.160 --> 21:38.160
 Yeah.

21:38.160 --> 21:46.000
 So, you know, if you and I took a little trip to the interstellar medium, I think we would

21:46.000 --> 21:49.560
 develop cancer and die real fast, right?

21:49.560 --> 21:50.560
 That's rough.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.560
 Yeah.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.920
 It's a pretty hostile radiation environment.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.600
 You don't actually have to go to the interstellar medium.

21:56.600 --> 22:00.240
 You just have to leave the earth's magnetic field too.

22:00.240 --> 22:03.480
 And then you're not doing so well suddenly.

22:03.480 --> 22:12.720
 So you know, this idea of, you know, life kind of traveling between places, it's not

22:12.720 --> 22:18.480
 entirely implausible, but you really have to twist, I think, a lot of parameters.

22:18.480 --> 22:22.800
 One of the problems we have is we don't actually know how life originates, right?

22:22.800 --> 22:29.520
 So it's kind of a second order question of survival in the interstellar medium and how

22:29.520 --> 22:37.880
 resilient it is because we think you require water, but, and that's certainly the case

22:37.880 --> 22:43.080
 for the earth, but you know, we really don't know for sure.

22:43.080 --> 22:49.160
 That said, I will argue that the question of like, are there aliens out there is a very

22:49.160 --> 22:53.520
 boring question because the answer is, of course there are.

22:53.520 --> 23:02.800
 I mean, like we know that there are planets around almost every star.

23:02.800 --> 23:05.400
 Of course there are other life forms.

23:05.400 --> 23:11.280
 Life is not some specific thing that happened on the earth and that's it, right?

23:11.280 --> 23:12.760
 That's a statistical impossibility.

23:12.760 --> 23:13.760
 Yeah.

23:13.760 --> 23:19.240
 Yeah, but the difficult question is before even the fact that we don't know how life

23:19.240 --> 23:25.240
 originates, I don't think we even know what life is like definitionally, like formalizing

23:25.240 --> 23:32.440
 a kind of picture of, in terms of the mechanism we would use to search for life out there

23:32.440 --> 23:36.520
 or even when we're on a planet to say, is this life?

23:36.520 --> 23:42.480
 Is this rock that just moved from where it was yesterday life or maybe not even a rock,

23:42.480 --> 23:43.480
 something else?

23:43.480 --> 23:46.920
 I got to tell you, I want to know what life is, okay?

23:46.920 --> 23:51.800
 And I want you to show me.

23:51.800 --> 23:57.280
 I think there's a song to basically accompany every single thing we talk about today and

23:57.280 --> 24:02.360
 probably half of them are love songs and somehow we'll integrate George Michael into the whole

24:02.360 --> 24:03.360
 thing.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.360
 Okay.

24:04.360 --> 24:08.100
 So your intuition is there's life everywhere in our universe.

24:08.100 --> 24:10.520
 Do you think there's intelligent life out there?

24:10.520 --> 24:11.960
 I think it's entirely plausible.

24:11.960 --> 24:17.280
 I mean, it's entirely plausible.

24:17.280 --> 24:23.640
 I think there's intelligent life on earth and so yeah, taking that, like say whatever

24:23.640 --> 24:29.920
 this thing we got on earth, whether it's dolphins or humans, say that's intelligent.

24:29.920 --> 24:30.920
 Definitely dolphins.

24:30.920 --> 24:34.160
 I mean, have you seen the dolphins?

24:34.160 --> 24:37.020
 Well, they do some cruel stuff to each other.

24:37.020 --> 24:43.440
 So if cruelty is a definition of intelligence, they're pretty good and then humans are pretty

24:43.440 --> 24:44.440
 good in that regard.

24:44.440 --> 24:48.920
 And then there's like pigs are very intelligent.

24:48.920 --> 24:54.120
 I got actually a chance to hang out with pigs recently and they're, aside from the fact

24:54.120 --> 25:01.840
 they were trying to eat me, they love food, they love food, but there's an intelligence

25:01.840 --> 25:09.200
 to their eyes that was kind of like haunts me because I also love to eat meat and then

25:09.200 --> 25:15.920
 to meet the thing I later ate and that was very intelligent and almost charismatic with

25:15.920 --> 25:21.480
 the way he was expressing himself, herself, itself was quite incredible.

25:21.480 --> 25:28.080
 So all that to say is if we have intelligent life here on earth, if you take dolphins,

25:28.080 --> 25:33.400
 pigs, humans, from the perspective of like planetary science, how unique is earth?

25:33.400 --> 25:34.400
 Okay.

25:34.400 --> 25:41.600
 So earth is not a common outcome of the planet formation process.

25:41.600 --> 25:48.400
 It's probably a something on the order of maybe a 1% effect.

25:48.400 --> 25:53.200
 And by earth, I mean not just an earth mass planet, okay?

25:53.200 --> 26:00.440
 I mean the architecture of the solar system that allows the earth to exist in its kind

26:00.440 --> 26:06.300
 of very temperate way.

26:06.300 --> 26:13.440
 One thing to understand and this is pretty crucial, right, is that the earth itself formed

26:13.440 --> 26:23.160
 well after the gas disk that formed the giant planets had already dissipated.

26:23.160 --> 26:28.720
 You see stars start out with, you know, the star and then a disk of gas and dust that

26:28.720 --> 26:30.800
 encircles it, okay?

26:30.800 --> 26:36.300
 From this disk of gas and dust, big planets can emerge.

26:36.300 --> 26:43.640
 And we have over the last two, three decades discovered thousands of extra solar planets

26:43.640 --> 26:45.140
 as an orbit or other stars.

26:45.140 --> 26:53.000
 What we see is that many of them have these expansive hydrogen helium atmospheres.

26:53.000 --> 26:59.840
 The fact that the earth doesn't is deeply connected to the fact that earth took about

26:59.840 --> 27:01.600
 100 million years to form.

27:01.600 --> 27:08.040
 So we missed that, you know, train, so to speak, to get that hydrogen helium atmosphere.

27:08.040 --> 27:10.560
 That's why actually we can see the sky, right?

27:10.560 --> 27:17.440
 That's why the sky is, well, at least in most places, that's why the atmosphere is not completely

27:17.440 --> 27:20.680
 opaque.

27:20.680 --> 27:26.880
 With that, you know, kind of thinking in mind, I would argue that we're getting the kind

27:26.880 --> 27:33.360
 of emergent pictures that the earth is not, you know, everywhere, right?

27:33.360 --> 27:37.360
 There's sort of the sci fi view of things where we go to some other star and we just

27:37.360 --> 27:40.400
 land on random planets and they're all earth like.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.000
 That's totally not true.

27:42.000 --> 27:49.120
 But even a low probability event, even if you imagine that earth is a one in a million

27:49.120 --> 27:58.520
 or one in 10 million occurrence, there are 10 to the 12 stars in the galaxy, right?

27:58.520 --> 28:03.440
 So you just, you always win by, that's right, by supply.

28:03.440 --> 28:04.440
 They save you.

28:04.440 --> 28:10.080
 Well, you've hypothesized that our solar system once possessed a population of short period

28:10.080 --> 28:17.640
 planets that were destroyed by the evil Jupiter migrating through the solar nebula.

28:17.640 --> 28:18.640
 Can you explain?

28:18.640 --> 28:22.840
 Well, if I was to say what was the kind of the key outcome of searches for extra solar

28:22.840 --> 28:30.440
 planets, it is that most stars are encircled by short period planets that are, you know,

28:30.440 --> 28:33.180
 a few earth masses, right?

28:33.180 --> 28:39.080
 So a few times bigger than the earth and have orbital periods that kind of range from days

28:39.080 --> 28:42.200
 to weeks.

28:42.200 --> 28:48.680
 Now if you go and ask the solar system what's in our region, right, in that region, it's

28:48.680 --> 28:50.720
 completely empty, right?

28:50.720 --> 28:53.960
 It's just, it's astonishingly hollow.

28:53.960 --> 29:00.560
 And think, you know, from the sun is not some, you know, special star that decided that it

29:00.560 --> 29:03.160
 was going to form the solar system.

29:03.160 --> 29:09.160
 So I think, you know, the natural thing to assume is that the same processes of planet

29:09.160 --> 29:15.080
 formation that occurred everywhere else also occurred in the solar system.

29:15.080 --> 29:20.080
 Following this logic, it's not implausible to imagine that the solar system once possessed

29:20.080 --> 29:28.520
 a system of intra Mercurian, like, you know, compact system of planets.

29:28.520 --> 29:33.640
 So then we asked ourselves, would such a system survive to this day?

29:33.640 --> 29:40.120
 And the answer is no, at least our calculations suggested it's highly unlikely because of

29:40.120 --> 29:41.760
 the formation of Jupiter.

29:41.760 --> 29:46.080
 And Jupiter's primordial kind of wandering through the solar system would have sent this

29:46.080 --> 29:51.680
 collisional field of debris that would have pushed that system of planets onto the sun.

29:51.680 --> 29:56.440
 So was Jupiter, this primordial wandering, what did Jupiter look like?

29:56.440 --> 29:58.120
 Like, why was it wandering?

29:58.120 --> 30:00.740
 It didn't have the orbit it has today?

30:00.740 --> 30:05.080
 We're pretty certain that giant planets like Jupiter, when they form, they migrate.

30:05.080 --> 30:11.680
 The reason they migrate is, you know, on a detailed level, perhaps difficult to explain,

30:11.680 --> 30:19.440
 but just in a qualitative sense, they form in this fluid disk of gas and dust.

30:19.440 --> 30:27.000
 So it's kind of like, okay, if I plop down a raft somewhere in the ocean, will it stay

30:27.000 --> 30:30.400
 where you plop it down or will it kind of get carried around?

30:30.400 --> 30:34.880
 It's not really a good analogy because it's not like Jupiter is being advected by the

30:34.880 --> 30:44.640
 currents of gas and dust, but the way it migrates is it carves out a hole in the disk and then

30:44.640 --> 30:50.040
 by interacting with the disk gravitationally, it can change its orbit.

30:50.040 --> 30:56.400
 The fact that the solar system has both Jupiter and Saturn here complicates things a lot because

30:56.400 --> 31:02.100
 you have to solve the problem of the evolution of the gas disk, the evolution of Jupiter's

31:02.100 --> 31:08.920
 orbit in the gas disk, plus evolution of Saturn's and their mutual interaction.

31:08.920 --> 31:15.800
 The common outcome of solving that problem, though, is pretty easy to explain.

31:15.800 --> 31:22.080
 Jupiter forms, its orbit shrinks, and then once Saturn forms, its orbit catches up basically

31:22.080 --> 31:24.880
 to the orbit of Jupiter and then both come out.

31:24.880 --> 31:30.840
 So there's this inward outward pattern of Jupiter's early motion that happens sort of

31:30.840 --> 31:36.820
 within the last million years of the lifetime of the solar system's primordial disk.

31:36.820 --> 31:44.260
 So while this is happening, if our calculations are correct, which I think they are, you can

31:44.260 --> 31:51.900
 destroy this inner system of, you know, few Earth mass planets.

31:51.900 --> 31:58.720
 And then in the aftermath of all this violence, you form the terrestrial planets.

31:58.720 --> 32:00.500
 Where would they come from in that case?

32:00.500 --> 32:05.640
 So Jupiter clears out the space, and then there's a few terrestrial planets that come

32:05.640 --> 32:12.440
 in and those come in from the disk somewhere, like one of the larger objects?

32:12.440 --> 32:18.920
 What actually happens in these calculations, you leave behind a rather mass depleted, like

32:18.920 --> 32:23.480
 remnant disk, only a couple Earth masses.

32:23.480 --> 32:33.000
 So then from that remnant population, annulus of material, over a hundred million years,

32:33.000 --> 32:37.240
 by just collisions, you grow the Earth and the Moon and everything else.

32:37.240 --> 32:38.240
 You said annulus?

32:38.240 --> 32:39.240
 Annulus.

32:39.240 --> 32:40.240
 Annulus.

32:40.240 --> 32:41.240
 Annulus, yeah.

32:41.240 --> 32:42.240
 That's a beautiful word.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.240
 What does that mean?

32:43.240 --> 32:45.240
 Well, it's like a disk that's kind of thin.

32:45.240 --> 32:50.800
 It's like a, yeah, it's something that is, you know, a disk that's so thin it's almost

32:50.800 --> 32:53.560
 flirting with being a ring.

32:53.560 --> 32:57.280
 Like I was going to say, this reminds me of Lord of the Rings, so like this, the word

32:57.280 --> 33:00.160
 just feels like it belongs in a token though.

33:00.160 --> 33:01.160
 Yeah.

33:01.160 --> 33:02.160
 Okay.

33:02.160 --> 33:03.160
 So that's incredible.

33:03.160 --> 33:09.320
 And so that, in your senses, you said like 1%, that's a rare, the way Jupiter and Saturn

33:09.320 --> 33:18.720
 danced and cleared out the short period debris and then changed the gravitational landscape.

33:18.720 --> 33:20.340
 That's a pretty rare thing too.

33:20.340 --> 33:21.340
 It's rare.

33:21.340 --> 33:24.860
 And moreover, like you don't even have to go to our calculations.

33:24.860 --> 33:31.200
 You can just ask the night sky, how many stars have Jupiter and Saturn analogs?

33:31.200 --> 33:36.980
 The answer is Jupiter and Saturn analogs are found around only 10% of Sun like stars.

33:36.980 --> 33:43.060
 They themselves, like you kind of have to score an A minus or better on the planet formation

33:43.060 --> 33:48.780
 test to become a solar system analog, even in that basic sense.

33:48.780 --> 33:56.560
 And moreover, you know, lower mass stars, which are very numerous in the galaxy, so

33:56.560 --> 34:03.620
 called M dwarfs, think like 0% of them, well, maybe like a negligible fraction of them have

34:03.620 --> 34:05.440
 giant planets.

34:05.440 --> 34:11.280
 Giant planets are a rare, you know, outcome of planet formation.

34:11.280 --> 34:15.040
 One of the really big problems that remain unanswered is why.

34:15.040 --> 34:18.480
 We don't actually understand why they're so rare.

34:18.480 --> 34:22.440
 How hard is it to simulate all of the things that we've been talking about, each of the

34:22.440 --> 34:27.440
 things we've been talking about, and maybe one day, all of the things we've been talking

34:27.440 --> 34:28.920
 about and beyond.

34:28.920 --> 34:36.960
 I mean, like from the initial primordial solar system, you know, a bunch of disks with, I

34:36.960 --> 34:42.060
 don't know, billions, trillions of objects in them, like simulate that such that you

34:42.060 --> 34:47.160
 eventually get a Jupiter and a Saturn, and then eventually you get the Jupiter and the

34:47.160 --> 34:51.440
 Saturn that clear out a disk, change the gravitational landscape, then Earth pops up, like that whole

34:51.440 --> 34:59.560
 thing, and then be able to do that for every other system in the, every other star in the

34:59.560 --> 35:04.680
 galaxy, and then be able to do that for other galaxies as well.

35:04.680 --> 35:07.440
 Yeah, so, look.

35:07.440 --> 35:11.320
 Maybe start from the smallest simulation, like what is actually being done today.

35:11.320 --> 35:14.520
 I mean, even the smallest simulation is probably super, super difficult.

35:14.520 --> 35:18.320
 Even just like one object in the Kuiper belt is probably super difficult to simulate.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.360
 I mean, I think it's super easy.

35:20.360 --> 35:23.720
 I mean, like, it's just not that hard.

35:23.720 --> 35:29.680
 But you know, let's ask the most kind of basic problem, okay?

35:29.680 --> 35:36.240
 So the problem of having a star and something in orbit of it, that you don't need a simulation

35:36.240 --> 35:39.440
 for, like you can just write that down on a piece of paper.

35:39.440 --> 35:47.720
 There's gravity, like yeah, I guess it's important to try to, you know, one way to simulate objects

35:47.720 --> 35:50.520
 in our solar system is to build the universe from scratch.

35:50.520 --> 35:54.240
 Okay, we'll get to building the universe from scratch in a sec.

35:54.240 --> 35:58.560
 But let me just kind of go through the hierarchy of what, you know, what we do.

35:58.560 --> 35:59.560
 Two objects.

35:59.560 --> 36:05.720
 Two objects, analytically solvable, like we can figure it out very easily if you just,

36:05.720 --> 36:08.720
 I don't think you, yeah, you don't need to know calculus.

36:08.720 --> 36:13.660
 It helps to know calculus, but you don't necessarily need to know calculus.

36:13.660 --> 36:18.820
 Three objects that are gravitationally interacting, the solution is chaotic.

36:18.820 --> 36:25.280
 Doesn't matter how many simulations you do, the answer loses meaning after some time.

36:25.280 --> 36:30.320
 I feel like that is a metaphor for dating as well, but go on.

36:30.320 --> 36:39.120
 Now look, yeah, so the fact that you go from analytically solvable to unpredictable, you

36:39.120 --> 36:46.200
 know, when your simulation goes from two bodies to three bodies should immediately tell you

36:46.200 --> 36:53.400
 that the exercise of trying to engineer a calculation where you form the entire solar

36:53.400 --> 37:00.440
 system from scratch and hope to have some predictive answer is a futile one, right?

37:00.440 --> 37:03.520
 We will never succeed at such a simulation.

37:03.520 --> 37:09.240
 I feel like, just to clarify, you mean like explicitly having a clear equation that generalizes

37:09.240 --> 37:13.400
 the whole process enough to be able to make a prediction, or do you mean actually like

37:13.400 --> 37:18.820
 literally simulating the objects is a hopeless pursuit once it goes beyond three?

37:18.820 --> 37:26.540
 The simulating them is not a hopeless pursuit, but the outcome becomes a statistical one.

37:26.540 --> 37:34.400
 What's actually quite interesting is I think we have all the equations figured out, right?

37:34.400 --> 37:39.680
 You know, in order to really understand this, the formation of the solar system, it suffices

37:39.680 --> 37:47.240
 to know gravity and magnetohydrodynamics, I mean, like a combination of Maxwell's equations

37:47.240 --> 37:50.560
 and Navier Stokes equations for the fluids.

37:50.560 --> 37:54.800
 You need to know quantum mechanics to understand the capacities and so on.

37:54.800 --> 37:59.220
 But we have those equations in hand.

37:59.220 --> 38:05.240
 It's not that we don't have that understanding, it's that putting it all together is A, very,

38:05.240 --> 38:13.660
 very difficult, and B, if you were to run the same evolution twice, changing, you know,

38:13.660 --> 38:19.240
 the initial conditions by some infinitesimal amount, some, you know, minor change in your

38:19.240 --> 38:23.240
 calculation to start with, you would get a different answer.

38:23.240 --> 38:29.720
 This is one, this is part of the reason why planetary systems are so diverse.

38:29.720 --> 38:36.740
 You don't have like a, you know, very predictive path for you start with a disk of this mass

38:36.740 --> 38:42.400
 and it's around this star, therefore you're going to form the solar system, right?

38:42.400 --> 38:47.620
 You start with this and therefore you will conform this huge outcome, huge set of outcomes,

38:47.620 --> 38:50.720
 and some percentage of it will resemble the solar system.

38:50.720 --> 38:57.600
 You mentioned quantum mechanics and we're talking about cosmic scale objects.

38:57.600 --> 39:02.680
 You've talked about that the evolution of astrophysical disks can be modeled with Schrodinger's

39:02.680 --> 39:03.680
 equation.

39:03.680 --> 39:04.680
 I sure did.

39:04.680 --> 39:05.680
 Why?

39:05.680 --> 39:14.520
 Like, how does quantum mechanics become relevant when you consider the evolution of objects

39:14.520 --> 39:15.520
 in the solar system?

39:15.520 --> 39:16.520
 Yeah.

39:16.520 --> 39:22.680
 Well, let me take a step back and just say, like, I remember being, you know, utterly

39:22.680 --> 39:26.880
 confused by quantum mechanics when I first learned it.

39:26.880 --> 39:32.680
 And the Schrodinger equation, which is kind of the parent equation of that whole field,

39:32.680 --> 39:35.400
 you know, seems to come out of nowhere, right?

39:35.400 --> 39:40.800
 The way that I was sort of explaining it, I remember asking, you know, my professor

39:40.800 --> 39:42.840
 is like, but where does it come from?

39:42.840 --> 39:47.520
 And I'm like, well, it's just like, don't worry about it and just like calculate the

39:47.520 --> 39:50.280
 hydrogen, you know, energy levels, right?

39:50.280 --> 39:52.320
 So it's like I could do all the problems.

39:52.320 --> 39:58.680
 I just did not have any intuition for where this parent, you know, super important equation

39:58.680 --> 39:59.680
 came from.

39:59.680 --> 40:04.360
 Now, down the line, I was, remember, I was preparing for my own lecture and I was trying

40:04.360 --> 40:09.960
 to understand how waves travel in self gravitating disks.

40:09.960 --> 40:17.320
 So you know, again, there's a very broad theory that's already developed, but I was looking

40:17.320 --> 40:22.760
 for some simpler way to explain it really for the purposes of teaching class.

40:22.760 --> 40:30.520
 And so I thought, okay, what if I just imagine a disk as an infinite number of concentric

40:30.520 --> 40:31.520
 circles, right?

40:31.520 --> 40:36.480
 That interact with each other gravitationally.

40:36.480 --> 40:44.560
 That's a problem in some sense that I can solve using methods from like the late 1700s.

40:44.560 --> 40:49.440
 I can write down Hamiltonian, well, I can write down the energy function basically of

40:49.440 --> 40:51.840
 their interactions.

40:51.840 --> 40:59.500
 And what I found is that when you take the continuum limit, when you go from discrete

40:59.500 --> 41:07.920
 circles that are talking to each other gravitationally to a continuum disk, suddenly this gravitational

41:07.920 --> 41:10.760
 interaction among them, right?

41:10.760 --> 41:14.200
 The governing equation becomes the Schrodinger equation.

41:14.200 --> 41:15.800
 I had to think about that for a little bit.

41:15.800 --> 41:19.560
 Did you just unify quantum mechanics and gravity?

41:19.560 --> 41:25.720
 No, this is not the same thing as like, you know, fusing relativity and quantum mechanics.

41:25.720 --> 41:29.520
 But it did get me thinking a little bit.

41:29.520 --> 41:37.920
 So the fact that waves in astrophysical disks behave just like wave functions of particles

41:37.920 --> 41:43.520
 is kind of like an interesting analogy because for me it's easier to imagine waves traveling

41:43.520 --> 41:48.480
 through, you know, astrophysical disks or really just sheets of paper.

41:48.480 --> 41:55.320
 And the reason this is, that analogy exists is because there's actually nothing quantum

41:55.320 --> 41:57.280
 about the Schrodinger equation.

41:57.280 --> 42:04.320
 The Schrodinger equation is just a wave equation and all of the interpretation that comes from

42:04.320 --> 42:11.000
 it is quantum, but the equation itself is not a quantum being.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.320
 So you can use it to model waves.

42:14.320 --> 42:15.320
 It's not turtles.

42:15.320 --> 42:16.320
 It's waves all the way down.

42:16.320 --> 42:19.000
 You can pick which level you pick the wave at.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.160
 So it could be at the solar system level that you can use it.

42:22.160 --> 42:28.800
 And also it actually provides a pretty neat calculational tool because it's difficult.

42:28.800 --> 42:34.160
 So we just talked about simulations, but it's difficult to simulate the behavior of astrophysical

42:34.160 --> 42:42.360
 disks on timescales that are in between a few orbits and their entire evolution.

42:42.360 --> 42:48.320
 So it's over a timescale of a few orbits, you have, you do a hydrodynamic, you know,

42:48.320 --> 42:49.320
 simulation, right?

42:49.320 --> 42:55.120
 You do that, basically that's something that you can do on a modern computer on a timescale

42:55.120 --> 42:56.700
 of say a week.

42:56.700 --> 43:01.400
 When it comes to their evolution over their entire lifetime, you don't hope to resolve

43:01.400 --> 43:02.400
 the orbits.

43:02.400 --> 43:07.200
 You just kind of hope to understand how the system behaves in between, right?

43:07.200 --> 43:11.540
 To get access to that, as it turns out, it's pretty, it's pretty cute.

43:11.540 --> 43:16.860
 You can use, you can use the Schrodinger equation to get the answer rapidly, so it's a calculational

43:16.860 --> 43:17.860
 tool.

43:17.860 --> 43:18.860
 That's fascinating.

43:18.860 --> 43:22.440
 So astrophysical disks, how, what are they?

43:22.440 --> 43:23.680
 How broad is this definition?

43:23.680 --> 43:24.680
 Okay.

43:24.680 --> 43:31.280
 So astrophysical disks span a huge, huge amount of ranges.

43:31.280 --> 43:33.800
 They start maybe at the smallest scale.

43:33.800 --> 43:35.840
 They start with actually Kuiper belt objects.

43:35.840 --> 43:38.620
 Some Kuiper belt objects have rings.

43:38.620 --> 43:42.200
 So that's maybe the smallest example of an astrophysical disk.

43:42.200 --> 43:47.520
 You've got this little potato shaped asteroid, you know, which is, you know, sort of the

43:47.520 --> 43:53.360
 size of LA or something, and around it are some rings of icy matter.

43:53.360 --> 43:57.040
 That object is a small astrophysical disk.

43:57.040 --> 43:59.820
 Then you have Saturn, the rings of Saturn.

43:59.820 --> 44:03.960
 You have the next set of scale, you have the solar system itself when it was forming, you

44:03.960 --> 44:04.960
 have a disk.

44:04.960 --> 44:07.540
 Then you have black hole disks.

44:07.540 --> 44:09.840
 You have galaxies.

44:09.840 --> 44:12.280
 Disks are super common in the universe.

44:12.280 --> 44:15.680
 The reason is that stuff rotates, right?

44:15.680 --> 44:16.680
 I mean, that's...

44:16.680 --> 44:17.680
 Yeah.

44:17.680 --> 44:24.320
 So, and those rings could be the material that composes those rings could be, it could

44:24.320 --> 44:27.240
 be gas, it could be solid, it could be anything.

44:27.240 --> 44:28.240
 That's right.

44:28.240 --> 44:35.400
 So, the disk that made from which the planets emerged was predominantly hydrogen, helium,

44:35.400 --> 44:36.400
 gas.

44:36.400 --> 44:41.420
 On the other hand, the rings of Saturn are made up of, you know, icicle, ice, little

44:41.420 --> 44:47.200
 like ice cubes this big, about a centimeter across.

44:47.200 --> 44:48.200
 Sounds refreshing.

44:48.200 --> 44:49.200
 So, that's incredible.

44:49.200 --> 44:50.720
 Hydrogen, helium, gas.

44:50.720 --> 44:55.980
 So, in the beginning, it was just hydrogen and helium around the sun.

44:55.980 --> 45:01.760
 How does that lead to the first formations of solid objects in terms of simulation?

45:01.760 --> 45:02.760
 Okay.

45:02.760 --> 45:03.760
 Here's the story.

45:03.760 --> 45:06.760
 So, you're like, have you ever been to the desert?

45:06.760 --> 45:07.760
 Yes.

45:07.760 --> 45:12.240
 I've been to the Death Valley and actually it was terrifying, just a total tangent, I'm

45:12.240 --> 45:13.240
 distracting you.

45:13.240 --> 45:14.240
 No.

45:14.240 --> 45:19.360
 But I was driving through it and I was really surprised because it was, at first, hot.

45:19.360 --> 45:23.920
 And then as it was getting into the evening, there's this huge thunderstorm, like it was

45:23.920 --> 45:25.800
 raining and it got freezing cold.

45:25.800 --> 45:26.800
 I'm like, what the hell?

45:26.800 --> 45:27.800
 It was the apocalypse.

45:27.800 --> 45:28.800
 Yes.

45:28.800 --> 45:33.420
 I had to like just sit there listening to Bruce Springsteen, I remember, and just thinking,

45:33.420 --> 45:37.720
 I'm probably going to die and I was okay with it because Bruce Springsteen was on the radio.

45:37.720 --> 45:42.000
 But look, when you've got the boss, you're ready to meet the boss.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
 Yeah.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
 So, look, I mean.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
 That's a good line.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
 Anyway, sorry.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
 That does, yes.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
 It's true.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
 Yeah.

45:49.000 --> 45:57.800
 By the way, to continue on this tangent, I absolutely love the Southwest for this reason.

45:57.800 --> 46:02.400
 During the pandemic, I drove from LA to New Mexico a bunch of times.

46:02.400 --> 46:03.640
 The madness of weather?

46:03.640 --> 46:04.640
 Yeah.

46:04.640 --> 46:05.640
 The chaos.

46:05.640 --> 46:09.800
 The madness of weather, the fact that it will be blazing hot one minute and then it's just

46:09.800 --> 46:15.680
 like, we'll decide to have a little thunderstorm, maybe we'll decide to go back momentarily

46:15.680 --> 46:19.200
 to like a thousand degrees and then go back to the thunderstorm.

46:19.200 --> 46:20.200
 It's amazing.

46:20.200 --> 46:23.560
 It's that, by the way, is chaos theory in action.

46:23.560 --> 46:24.560
 Right.

46:24.560 --> 46:26.800
 But let's get back to talking about the desert.

46:26.800 --> 46:33.880
 So, in the desert, tumbleweeds have a tendency to roll because the wind rolls them.

46:33.880 --> 46:38.600
 And if you're careful, you'll occasionally see this family of tumbleweeds where there's

46:38.600 --> 46:44.800
 like a big one and then a bunch of little ones that kind of hide in its wake and are

46:44.800 --> 46:51.440
 all rolling together and almost looks like a family of ducks crossing the street or something.

46:51.440 --> 46:58.320
 Or for example, if you watch Tour de France, you've got a whole bunch of cyclists and they're

46:58.320 --> 47:01.900
 like cycling within 10 centimeters of each other.

47:01.900 --> 47:03.960
 They're not BFFs, right?

47:03.960 --> 47:07.380
 They're not trying to be, trying to ride together.

47:07.380 --> 47:16.360
 They are riding together to minimize the collective air resistance, if you will, that they experience.

47:16.360 --> 47:21.960
 Turns out solids in the protoplanetary disk do just this.

47:21.960 --> 47:30.040
 There's an instability wherein solid particles, things that are a centimeter across will start

47:30.040 --> 47:33.800
 to hide behind one another and form these clouds.

47:33.800 --> 47:34.920
 Why?

47:34.920 --> 47:42.180
 Because cumulatively, that minimizes the solid component of this aerodynamic interaction

47:42.180 --> 47:43.180
 with the gas.

47:43.180 --> 47:49.560
 Now, these clouds, because they're kind of a favorable energetic condition for the dust

47:49.560 --> 47:54.980
 to live in, they grow, grow, grow, grow, grow until they become so massive that they collapse

47:54.980 --> 47:56.860
 under their own weight.

47:56.860 --> 47:59.680
 That's how the first building blocks of planets form.

47:59.680 --> 48:02.520
 That's how the big asteroids got there.

48:02.520 --> 48:03.520
 That's incredible.

48:03.520 --> 48:04.520
 Yeah.

48:04.520 --> 48:06.880
 So that, is that simulatable or is it not useful to simulate?

48:06.880 --> 48:09.500
 No, no, that's simulatable.

48:09.500 --> 48:12.520
 And people do these types of calculations.

48:12.520 --> 48:13.680
 It's really cool.

48:13.680 --> 48:18.800
 That's actually, that's one of the many fields of planet formation theory that is really,

48:18.800 --> 48:20.300
 really active right now.

48:20.300 --> 48:24.640
 People are trying to understand all kinds of aspects of that process because of course

48:24.640 --> 48:29.320
 I've explained it, you know, like as if there's one thing that happens.

48:29.320 --> 48:37.820
 Turns out it's a beautifully rich dynamic, but qualitatively, formation of the first

48:37.820 --> 48:42.580
 building blocks actually follows the same sequence as formation of stars, right?

48:42.580 --> 48:50.600
 Stars are just clouds of gas, hydrogen, helium, gas that sit in space and slowly cool.

48:50.600 --> 48:57.440
 And at some point they, you know, contract to a point where their gravity overtakes the

48:57.440 --> 49:00.160
 thermal pressure support, if you will.

49:00.160 --> 49:03.680
 And they collapse under their own weight and you get a little baby solar system.

49:03.680 --> 49:04.680
 That's amazing.

49:04.680 --> 49:11.780
 So do you think one day it will be possible to simulate the full history that took our

49:11.780 --> 49:14.560
 solar system to what it is today?

49:14.560 --> 49:15.880
 Yes.

49:15.880 --> 49:16.880
 And it will be useless.

49:16.880 --> 49:17.880
 Okay.

49:17.880 --> 49:22.400
 So you don't think your story, many of the ideas that you have about Jupiter clear in

49:22.400 --> 49:26.760
 the space, like retelling that story in high resolution is not that important.

49:26.760 --> 49:36.280
 I actually think it's important, but at every stage you have to design your experiments,

49:36.280 --> 49:44.420
 your numerical computer experiments so that they test some specific aspect of that evolution.

49:44.420 --> 49:53.300
 I am not a proponent of doing huge simulations because even if we forget the information

49:53.300 --> 50:00.280
 theory aspect of not being able to simulate in full detail the universe, because if you

50:00.280 --> 50:05.260
 do, then you have made an actual universe.

50:05.260 --> 50:07.920
 It's not the simulation, right?

50:07.920 --> 50:10.480
 Simulation is in some sense a compression of information.

50:10.480 --> 50:13.520
 So therefore you must lose detail.

50:13.520 --> 50:22.280
 But that point aside, if we are able to simulate the entire history of the solar system in

50:22.280 --> 50:28.920
 excruciating detail, I mean, it'll be cool, but it's not going to be any different from

50:28.920 --> 50:31.820
 observing it, right?

50:31.820 --> 50:38.840
 Because theoretical understanding, which is what ultimately I'm interested in, comes from

50:38.840 --> 50:45.400
 taking complex things and reducing them down to something that, you know, some mechanism

50:45.400 --> 50:49.060
 that you can actually quantify.

50:49.060 --> 50:54.280
 That's the fun part of astrophysics, just kind of simulating things in extreme detail

50:54.280 --> 51:02.240
 is we'll make cool visualizations, but that doesn't get you to any better understanding

51:02.240 --> 51:04.800
 than you had before you did the simulation.

51:04.800 --> 51:10.720
 So if you ask very specific questions, then you'll be able to create like very highly

51:10.720 --> 51:15.560
 compressed, nice, beautiful theories about how things evolved, and then you can use those

51:15.560 --> 51:21.200
 to then generalize to other solar systems, to other stars and other galaxies, and then

51:21.200 --> 51:24.880
 say something generalizable about the entire universe.

51:24.880 --> 51:31.240
 How difficult would it be to simulate our solar system such that we would not know the

51:31.240 --> 51:32.240
 difference?

51:32.240 --> 51:38.960
 Meaning, if we are living in a simulation, is there a nice, think of it as a video game,

51:38.960 --> 51:43.720
 is there a nice compressible way of doing that, or just kind of like you intuited with

51:43.720 --> 51:51.240
 a three body situation is just a giant mess that you cannot create a video game that will

51:51.240 --> 51:56.960
 seem realistic without actually building your solar system from scratch?

51:56.960 --> 52:04.760
 I'm speculating, but one of the, yeah, I know you have a deep understanding of this, but

52:04.760 --> 52:11.960
 for me, I'm just going to speculate that for at least in the types of simulations that

52:11.960 --> 52:19.120
 we can do today, inevitably, you run into the problem of resolution, right?

52:19.120 --> 52:22.000
 Doesn't matter what you're doing, it is discrete.

52:22.000 --> 52:28.240
 Now, the way you would go about asking, you know, what we're observing, is that a simulation

52:28.240 --> 52:35.520
 or is that, you know, some real continuous thing, is you zoom in, right?

52:35.520 --> 52:42.320
 You zoom in and try and find the, you know, the grid scale, if you will.

52:42.320 --> 52:55.880
 Yeah, I mean, it's a really interesting question, and because the solar system itself and really,

52:55.880 --> 52:59.200
 you know, the double pendulum is chaotic, right?

52:59.200 --> 53:06.960
 From sitting on another pendulum, it moves unpredictably once you let them go.

53:06.960 --> 53:12.520
 You really don't need to, like, inject any randomness into a simulation for it to give

53:12.520 --> 53:16.200
 you stochastic and unpredictable answers.

53:16.200 --> 53:18.540
 Weather is a great example of this.

53:18.540 --> 53:23.680
 Weather has a lapen of time of, you know, typical weather systems have a lapen of time

53:23.680 --> 53:25.040
 of a few days.

53:25.040 --> 53:30.760
 And there's a fundamental reason why the force forecast always sucks, you know, two weeks

53:30.760 --> 53:32.160
 in advance.

53:32.160 --> 53:39.200
 It's not that we don't know the equations that govern the atmosphere, we know them well.

53:39.200 --> 53:42.520
 Their solutions are meaningless, though, after a few days.

53:42.520 --> 53:45.160
 The zooming in thing is very interesting.

53:45.160 --> 53:51.640
 I think about this a lot, whether there'll be a time soon where we would want to stay

53:51.640 --> 53:55.560
 in video game worlds, whether it's virtual reality or just playing video games.

53:55.560 --> 54:01.560
 I mean, I think that time, like, came in, like, the 90s, and it's been that time.

54:01.560 --> 54:05.040
 Well, it's not just came, I mean, it's accelerated.

54:05.040 --> 54:12.080
 I just recently saw that WoW and Fortnite were played 140 billion hours, and those are

54:12.080 --> 54:13.340
 just video games.

54:13.340 --> 54:17.640
 And that's, like, increasing very, very quickly, especially with the people coming up now,

54:17.640 --> 54:21.840
 being born now and become, you know, becoming teenagers and so on.

54:21.840 --> 54:25.240
 Let's have a thought experiment where it's just you and a video game character inside

54:25.240 --> 54:33.120
 a room, where you remove the simulation, they need to simulate sort of a lot of objects.

54:33.120 --> 54:39.200
 If it's just you and that character, how far do you need to simulate in terms of zooming

54:39.200 --> 54:43.920
 in for it to be very real to you, as real as reality?

54:43.920 --> 54:48.680
 So like, first of all, you kind of mentioned zooming in, which is fascinating, because

54:48.680 --> 54:53.440
 we have these tools of science that allow us to zoom in, quote unquote, in all kinds

54:53.440 --> 54:57.260
 of ways in the world around us.

54:57.260 --> 55:01.760
 But our cognitive abilities, like our perception system as humans, is very limited in terms

55:01.760 --> 55:02.760
 of zooming in.

55:02.760 --> 55:04.600
 So we might be very easily fooled.

55:04.600 --> 55:11.680
 Some of the video games, like, on the PS4, like, look pretty real to me, right?

55:11.680 --> 55:16.520
 I think, you know, you would really have to interrogate, I mean, I think even with what

55:16.520 --> 55:22.680
 we have today, like, I don't know, Ace Combat 7 is a great example, right?

55:22.680 --> 55:29.360
 Like, I mean, the way that the clouds are rendered, it's, I mean, it looks just like

55:29.360 --> 55:34.120
 when you're flying, you know, on a real airplane, the kind of transparency.

55:34.120 --> 55:41.680
 I think that the, you know, our perception is limited enough already to not be able to

55:41.680 --> 55:46.400
 tell some of the, you know, some of the differences.

55:46.400 --> 55:48.580
 There's a game called Skyrim.

55:48.580 --> 55:51.640
 It's an Elder Scrolls role playing game.

55:51.640 --> 55:55.240
 And I just, I played it for quite a bit.

55:55.240 --> 55:58.640
 And I think I played it very different than others.

55:58.640 --> 56:03.180
 Like, there'll be long stretches of time where I would just walk around and look at nature

56:03.180 --> 56:04.180
 in the game.

56:04.180 --> 56:05.180
 It's incredible.

56:05.180 --> 56:06.320
 Oh, sure.

56:06.320 --> 56:10.320
 It's just like the graphics is like, wow, I want to stay there.

56:10.320 --> 56:11.320
 It was better.

56:11.320 --> 56:12.320
 I went hiking recently.

56:12.320 --> 56:14.880
 It was like as good as hiking.

56:14.880 --> 56:16.240
 So look, I know what you mean.

56:16.240 --> 56:21.480
 Not to go on a huge video game, you know, tangent, but like the third, like, Witcher

56:21.480 --> 56:25.600
 game was astonishingly beautiful, right?

56:25.600 --> 56:31.560
 Especially like playing on a good hardware machine, it's like, this is pretty, this is

56:31.560 --> 56:32.820
 pretty legit.

56:32.820 --> 56:40.560
 That said, um, you know, I, I don't resonate with the, I want to stay here, you know, like

56:40.560 --> 56:47.840
 one of the things that I love to do is to go to my like boxing gym and, and box with

56:47.840 --> 56:48.840
 a guy.

56:48.840 --> 56:49.840
 Right.

56:49.840 --> 56:54.080
 Like that's, there's, there's nothing quite like that physical, you know, experience.

56:54.080 --> 56:55.080
 Like

56:55.080 --> 56:56.080
 that's fascinating.

56:56.080 --> 57:00.960
 That might be simply an artifact of the year you were born maybe because if you're born

57:00.960 --> 57:07.720
 today, it almost seems like stupid to go to a gym, like you're going to a gym to box with

57:07.720 --> 57:08.720
 a guy.

57:08.720 --> 57:13.520
 Why not box with Mike Tyson when you yourself is like in his prime, when you yourself are

57:13.520 --> 57:16.040
 also an incredible boxer in the video game world.

57:16.040 --> 57:21.240
 For me, there, there's a multitude of reasons why I don't want to box with Mike Tyson.

57:21.240 --> 57:22.240
 Right.

57:22.240 --> 57:23.240
 No, no, no, no.

57:23.240 --> 57:26.280
 I enjoy teeth, you know, and I want to have an ear.

57:26.280 --> 57:31.440
 No, but your, your skills in this meat space, in this physical realm is very limited and

57:31.440 --> 57:37.520
 takes a lot of work and you're, you're a musician, you're an incredible scientist.

57:37.520 --> 57:42.040
 You only have so much time in the, in the day, but in the video game world, you can

57:42.040 --> 57:47.080
 expand your capabilities and all kinds of dimensions that you can never have possibly

57:47.080 --> 57:48.640
 have time in the physical world.

57:48.640 --> 57:54.780
 And so that, it doesn't make sense like to, to be existing, to be working your ass off

57:54.780 --> 58:01.480
 in the physical world when you can just be super successful in the video game world.

58:01.480 --> 58:04.000
 But I still, you enjoy sucking and stuff.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.320
 Yeah, I really struggling to get better.

58:06.320 --> 58:07.320
 I sure do.

58:07.320 --> 58:12.420
 I mean, I think like these days with music, music is a great example, right?

58:12.420 --> 58:18.560
 We just started, you know, practicing live with my band again, you know, after not playing

58:18.560 --> 58:22.680
 for a year and you know, it's just, it was terrible.

58:22.680 --> 58:28.160
 Like it was just kind of a lot of the nuance, you know, a lot of the detail is just that

58:28.160 --> 58:33.160
 detail that takes, you know, years of collective practice to develop.

58:33.160 --> 58:39.560
 It's just lost, but it was just an incredible amount of fun, way more fun than all the like

58:39.560 --> 58:44.680
 studio, you know, sitting around and playing that I did, you know, throughout the entire

58:44.680 --> 58:45.680
 year.

58:45.680 --> 58:50.560
 So I think there's something, there's something intangible or maybe, maybe tangible about

58:50.560 --> 58:54.120
 being, being in person.

58:54.120 --> 58:59.120
 I sure hope you're wrong and that, you know, we, that's not something that will get lost

58:59.120 --> 59:06.200
 because I think there's like such a large part of the human condition is to hang out.

59:06.200 --> 59:11.040
 If we were doing this interview on zoom, right?

59:11.040 --> 59:15.480
 I mean, I'd already be, I'd already be bored out of my mind.

59:15.480 --> 59:16.480
 Exactly.

59:16.480 --> 59:18.280
 I mean, there's something to that.

59:18.280 --> 59:22.440
 I mean, I'm almost playing devil's advocate, but at the same time, you know, I'm sure people

59:22.440 --> 59:28.200
 talk about the same way at the beginning of the 20th century about horses, where they're,

59:28.200 --> 59:34.320
 they are much more efficient, they're much easier to maintain than cars.

59:34.320 --> 59:37.780
 It doesn't make sense to have, you know, all the ways that cars break down and there's

59:37.780 --> 59:40.360
 not enough infrastructure in terms of roads for cars.

59:40.360 --> 59:41.720
 It doesn't make any sense.

59:41.720 --> 59:45.800
 Like horses and like nature, you could do the nature, like where, you know, you should

59:45.800 --> 59:47.480
 be living more natural life.

59:47.480 --> 59:48.480
 Horses are real.

59:48.480 --> 59:51.600
 You don't want machines in your life that are going to pollute your mind and the minds

59:51.600 --> 59:54.380
 of young people, but then eventually just cars took over.

59:54.380 --> 1:00:00.880
 So in that same way, it just seems, going back to horses, I'm just, you know, well,

1:00:00.880 --> 1:00:04.400
 you can be, you can play, what is it?

1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:08.920
 Red dead, red dead redemption, redemption, and that you can ride horses in the video

1:00:08.920 --> 1:00:09.920
 game world.

1:00:09.920 --> 1:00:10.920
 That's true.

1:00:10.920 --> 1:00:14.200
 So let me return us back to planet nine.

1:00:14.200 --> 1:00:15.880
 Always a good place to come back to.

1:00:15.880 --> 1:00:21.480
 So now that we did a big historical overview of our solar system, what is planet nine?

1:00:21.480 --> 1:00:22.640
 Okay.

1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:28.960
 Planet nine is a hypothetical object that orbits the solar system, right?

1:00:28.960 --> 1:00:36.760
 On orbital period of about 10,000 years and an orbit, which is slightly tilted with respect

1:00:36.760 --> 1:00:42.280
 to the plane of the solar system, slightly eccentric and the object itself we think is

1:00:42.280 --> 1:00:46.520
 five times more massive than the earth.

1:00:46.520 --> 1:00:53.640
 We have never seen planet nine in a telescope, but we have gravitational evidence for it.

1:00:53.640 --> 1:00:58.160
 And so this is where all the stuff we've been talking about, this clustering ideas, maybe

1:00:58.160 --> 1:01:02.080
 you can speak to the approximate location that we suspect.

1:01:02.080 --> 1:01:07.160
 And also the question I wanted to ask is what are we supposed to be imagining here?

1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:11.400
 Because you said there are certain objects in the Kuiper Belt that are kind of have a

1:01:11.400 --> 1:01:16.320
 direction to them that they're all like flocking in some kind of way.

1:01:16.320 --> 1:01:20.120
 So that's the sense that there's some kind of gravitational object, not changing their

1:01:20.120 --> 1:01:25.720
 orbit, but kind of confining them, like grouping their orbits together.

1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:31.040
 See, what would happen if planet nine were not there is these orbits that roughly share

1:01:31.040 --> 1:01:35.480
 a common orientation, they would just disperse, right?

1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:39.780
 They would just become as a mutually symmetric point everywhere.

1:01:39.780 --> 1:01:47.640
 Planet nine's gravity makes it such that these objects stay in a state that's basically anti

1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:55.640
 aligned with respect to the orbit of planet nine and sort of hang out there and kind of

1:01:55.640 --> 1:01:58.700
 oscillate on a timescale of about a billion years.

1:01:58.700 --> 1:02:03.420
 That's one of the lines of evidence for the existence of planet nine.

1:02:03.420 --> 1:02:04.420
 There are others.

1:02:04.420 --> 1:02:08.060
 That's the one that's easiest to maybe visualize just because it's fun to think about orbits

1:02:08.060 --> 1:02:15.240
 that all point into the same direction, but I should, you know, emphasize that, for example,

1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:20.820
 the existence of objects, again, Kuiper Belt objects that are heavily out of the plane

1:02:20.820 --> 1:02:26.720
 of the solar system, things that are tilted by say 90 degrees, that's not, we don't expect

1:02:26.720 --> 1:02:29.920
 that as an outcome of planet formation.

1:02:29.920 --> 1:02:37.520
 Indeed, planet formation simulations have never produced such objects without some extrinsic

1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:38.520
 gravitational force.

1:02:38.520 --> 1:02:43.160
 Planet nine, on the other hand, generates them very readily, so that provides kind of

1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:50.660
 an alternative, you know, population of small bodies in the solar system that also get produced

1:02:50.660 --> 1:02:54.240
 by planet nine through an independent kind of gravitational effect.

1:02:54.240 --> 1:03:02.840
 So they're kind of, there's basically five different things that planet nine does individually

1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:08.500
 that are like kind of maybe a one sigma effect where you'd say, yeah, okay, if that's all

1:03:08.500 --> 1:03:14.860
 it was, maybe it's not, no reason to jump up and down, but because it's a multitude

1:03:14.860 --> 1:03:22.300
 of these puzzles that all are explained by one hypothesis, that's really the magnetism,

1:03:22.300 --> 1:03:25.380
 the attraction of the planet nine model.

1:03:25.380 --> 1:03:34.160
 So can you just clarify, so most orbit, most planets in the solar system orbit at approximately

1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:35.660
 the same, so it's flat.

1:03:35.660 --> 1:03:38.220
 Yeah, it's like one degree.

1:03:38.220 --> 1:03:41.700
 The difference between them is about one degree.

1:03:41.700 --> 1:03:46.540
 But nevertheless, if we looked at our solar system, it would look, and I could see every

1:03:46.540 --> 1:03:49.140
 single object, it would look like a sphere.

1:03:49.140 --> 1:03:54.900
 The inner part where the planets are would look like, you know, flat, right?

1:03:54.900 --> 1:04:02.380
 The Kuiper belt and the asteroid belt have a larger, it gets fatter and fatter and fatter

1:04:02.380 --> 1:04:03.800
 and becomes a sphere.

1:04:03.800 --> 1:04:04.800
 That's right.

1:04:04.800 --> 1:04:11.300
 And if you look at the very outside, it's polluted by this quasi spheroidal thing.

1:04:11.300 --> 1:04:14.660
 Nobody's of course ever seen the Oort cloud, right?

1:04:14.660 --> 1:04:20.180
 We've only seen comments that come from the Oort cloud so that the Oort cloud, which is

1:04:20.180 --> 1:04:26.420
 this, right, population of distant debris, its existence is also inferred.

1:04:26.420 --> 1:04:32.340
 You could say alternatively, there is, you know, there's a big cosmic creature that occasionally,

1:04:32.340 --> 1:04:38.460
 you know, sitting at 20,000 AU and occasionally throws an icy rock towards the sun like that.

1:04:38.460 --> 1:04:40.260
 Spaghetti monster, I think it's called.

1:04:40.260 --> 1:04:41.260
 Okay.

1:04:41.260 --> 1:04:46.100
 I mean, so it's a mystery in many ways, but you can kind of infer a bunch of things about

1:04:46.100 --> 1:04:47.100
 it.

1:04:47.100 --> 1:04:51.340
 And by the way, both terrifying and exciting that there's this vast darkness all around

1:04:51.340 --> 1:04:54.220
 us that's full of objects that they're just throwing.

1:04:54.220 --> 1:04:55.220
 Just there.

1:04:55.220 --> 1:04:56.220
 Yeah.

1:04:56.220 --> 1:05:02.660
 It's actually kind of astonishing, right, that we have only explored a small fraction

1:05:02.660 --> 1:05:04.980
 of the solar system, right?

1:05:04.980 --> 1:05:11.620
 That really kind of baffles me because I remember as a student, you know, studying physics,

1:05:11.620 --> 1:05:16.620
 you know, you do the problem where you put the earth around the sun, you solve that and

1:05:16.620 --> 1:05:22.540
 like, it's one line of math and you say, okay, well, that surely was figured out by Newton.

1:05:22.540 --> 1:05:29.920
 So like all the interesting stuff is not in the solar system, but that it's just plainly

1:05:29.920 --> 1:05:30.920
 not true.

1:05:30.920 --> 1:05:37.980
 There are mysteries in the solar system that are remarkable that we are only now starting

1:05:37.980 --> 1:05:40.460
 to just kind of scratch the surface of.

1:05:40.460 --> 1:05:44.340
 And some of those objects probably have some information about the history of our solar

1:05:44.340 --> 1:05:45.340
 system.

1:05:45.340 --> 1:05:46.340
 Absolutely.

1:05:46.340 --> 1:05:50.460
 Like a great example is, you know, small meteorites, right?

1:05:50.460 --> 1:05:53.140
 Small meteorites are melted, right?

1:05:53.140 --> 1:05:59.020
 They have, they're differentiated, meaning some of the iron sinks, you say, well, how

1:05:59.020 --> 1:06:00.020
 can that be?

1:06:00.020 --> 1:06:04.540
 Because they're so small that they wouldn't have melted just from the heat of their accretion.

1:06:04.540 --> 1:06:10.140
 Turns out the fact that the solar nebula, the disk that made the planets was polluted

1:06:10.140 --> 1:06:13.940
 by aluminum 26 is in itself a remarkable thing.

1:06:13.940 --> 1:06:17.720
 It means the solar system did not form in isolation.

1:06:17.720 --> 1:06:23.940
 It formed in a giant cloud of thousands of other stars that were also forming, some of

1:06:23.940 --> 1:06:30.120
 which were undergoing, you know, going through supernova explosions, some of, and releasing

1:06:30.120 --> 1:06:37.900
 these unstable isotopes that, of which we now see kind of the traces of.

1:06:37.900 --> 1:06:38.900
 It's so cool.

1:06:38.900 --> 1:06:43.980
 Do you think it's possible that life from other solar systems was injected and that

1:06:43.980 --> 1:06:47.700
 was what was the origin of life on Earth?

1:06:47.700 --> 1:06:51.140
 Yeah, the Panspermia idea.

1:06:51.140 --> 1:06:54.580
 That's seen as a low probability event by people who studied the origin of life, but

1:06:54.580 --> 1:06:58.220
 that's because then they would be out of a job.

1:06:58.220 --> 1:07:02.020
 Well, I don't think they'd be out of the job because you just then say, you have to figure

1:07:02.020 --> 1:07:04.260
 out how life started there.

1:07:04.260 --> 1:07:05.460
 But then you have to go there.

1:07:05.460 --> 1:07:07.740
 We can study life on Earth much easier.

1:07:07.740 --> 1:07:13.300
 We could study it in the lab much easier because we can replicate conditions there from an

1:07:13.300 --> 1:07:19.780
 early Earth much easier from a chemistry perspective, from a biology perspective.

1:07:19.780 --> 1:07:21.160
 You can intuit a bunch of stuff.

1:07:21.160 --> 1:07:23.740
 You can look at different parts of Earth and just.

1:07:23.740 --> 1:07:28.780
 To an extent, I mean, the early Earth was completely unlike the current Earth, right?

1:07:28.780 --> 1:07:30.020
 There was no oxygen.

1:07:30.020 --> 1:07:41.260
 So one of my colleagues at Caltech, Joe Kirshnik, is certain, something like 100% certainty

1:07:41.260 --> 1:07:48.120
 that life started on Mars and came to Earth on Martian meteorites.

1:07:48.120 --> 1:07:55.620
 This is not a problem that I like to kind of think about too much, like the origin of

1:07:55.620 --> 1:07:56.620
 life.

1:07:56.620 --> 1:08:02.660
 It's a fascinating problem, but you know, it's not physics and I just like, I just don't

1:08:02.660 --> 1:08:03.660
 love it.

1:08:03.660 --> 1:08:08.140
 It's the same reason you don't love, I thought you're a musician, so music is not physics

1:08:08.140 --> 1:08:09.140
 either.

1:08:09.140 --> 1:08:10.140
 So why are you so into it?

1:08:10.140 --> 1:08:11.140
 It's 100% physics.

1:08:11.140 --> 1:08:20.860
 No, no, look, in all seriousness though, there are a few things that I really, really enjoy.

1:08:20.860 --> 1:08:23.300
 I genuinely enjoy physics.

1:08:23.300 --> 1:08:24.820
 I genuinely enjoy music.

1:08:24.820 --> 1:08:31.460
 I genuinely, you know, enjoy martial arts and I genuinely enjoy my family.

1:08:31.460 --> 1:08:35.980
 I should have said that all in a reverse order or something, but I like to focus on these

1:08:35.980 --> 1:08:39.820
 things and not worry too much about everything else.

1:08:39.820 --> 1:08:40.820
 You know what I mean?

1:08:40.820 --> 1:08:41.820
 Yes.

1:08:41.820 --> 1:08:44.900
 Just because there is a, like you said earlier, there's a time constraint.

1:08:44.900 --> 1:08:47.420
 You can't do it all.

1:08:47.420 --> 1:08:50.740
 There's many mysteries all around us.

1:08:50.740 --> 1:08:53.400
 And they're all beautiful in different ways.

1:08:53.400 --> 1:08:59.460
 To me, that thing I love is artificial intelligence that perhaps I love it because eventually

1:08:59.460 --> 1:09:03.860
 I'm trying to suck up to our future overlords.

1:09:03.860 --> 1:09:09.000
 The question of, you said there's a lot of kind of little pieces of evidence for this

1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.500
 thing that's Planet Nine.

1:09:11.500 --> 1:09:18.420
 If we were to try to collect more evidence or be certain, like a paper that says, like

1:09:18.420 --> 1:09:22.300
 you drop it, clear, we're done.

1:09:22.300 --> 1:09:23.300
 What does that require?

1:09:23.300 --> 1:09:28.700
 Are sending probes out or do you think we can do it from telescopes here on earth?

1:09:28.700 --> 1:09:32.060
 What are the different ideas for conclusive evidence for Planet Nine?

1:09:32.060 --> 1:09:36.820
 The moment Planet Nine gets imaged from a telescope on earth, it's done.

1:09:36.820 --> 1:09:37.820
 I mean, it's just there.

1:09:37.820 --> 1:09:38.820
 Can you clarify it?

1:09:38.820 --> 1:09:42.940
 Cause you mentioned that before from an image, would you be able to tell?

1:09:42.940 --> 1:09:43.940
 Yes.

1:09:43.940 --> 1:09:51.740
 So from an image, the moment you see something, something that is reflecting sunlight back

1:09:51.740 --> 1:10:01.980
 at you and you know that it's hundreds of times as far away from the sun as the earth,

1:10:01.980 --> 1:10:02.980
 you're done.

1:10:02.980 --> 1:10:08.020
 So you're thinking, so basically if you have a really far away thing that's big, five times

1:10:08.020 --> 1:10:13.920
 the size of earth, that means that is Planet Nine.

1:10:13.920 --> 1:10:15.460
 Could there be multiple objects like that?

1:10:15.460 --> 1:10:16.460
 I guess.

1:10:16.460 --> 1:10:17.460
 In principle, yeah.

1:10:17.460 --> 1:10:22.980
 I mean, there's no law of physics that doesn't allow you to have multiple, there's also no

1:10:22.980 --> 1:10:25.740
 evidence at present for there being multiple.

1:10:25.740 --> 1:10:31.380
 I wonder if it's possible, just like we're finding exoplanets, whether given the size

1:10:31.380 --> 1:10:36.300
 of the Oort Cloud, there's basically, it's rarer and rarer, but there are sprinkled Planet

1:10:36.300 --> 1:10:41.220
 Nine, 10, 11, 12, like these, some.

1:10:41.220 --> 1:10:42.220
 Got 13.

1:10:42.220 --> 1:10:43.220
 It goes after that.

1:10:43.220 --> 1:10:45.180
 I can just keep counting.

1:10:45.180 --> 1:10:50.660
 So just something about the dynamic system, it becomes lower and lower probability event,

1:10:50.660 --> 1:10:57.380
 but they gather up, they become larger and larger maybe, something like that.

1:10:57.380 --> 1:11:04.500
 I wonder if discovering Planet Nine will just be almost like a springboard, it's like, well,

1:11:04.500 --> 1:11:05.620
 what's beyond that?

1:11:05.620 --> 1:11:06.840
 It's entirely plausible.

1:11:06.840 --> 1:11:12.220
 The Oort Cloud itself probably holds about five earth masses or seven earth masses of

1:11:12.220 --> 1:11:13.220
 material.

1:11:13.220 --> 1:11:16.980
 Right, so it's not nothing.

1:11:16.980 --> 1:11:27.420
 And it all ultimately comes down to at what point will the observational surveys sample

1:11:27.420 --> 1:11:33.900
 enough of the solar system to kind of reveal interesting things.

1:11:33.900 --> 1:11:38.780
 There's a great analogy here with Neptune and the story of how Neptune was discovered.

1:11:38.780 --> 1:11:42.140
 Neptune was not discovered by looking at the sky, right?

1:11:42.140 --> 1:11:45.740
 It was discovered mathematically, right?

1:11:45.740 --> 1:11:58.860
 So yeah, the orbit of Uranus, when Uranus was found, this was 1781, both the tracking

1:11:58.860 --> 1:12:05.900
 of the orbit of Uranus as well as the reconstruction of the orbit of Uranus immediately revealed

1:12:05.900 --> 1:12:10.220
 that it was not following the orbit that it was supposed to, right?

1:12:10.220 --> 1:12:13.980
 The predicted orbit deviated away from where it actually was.

1:12:13.980 --> 1:12:24.240
 So in the mid 1800s, right, a French mathematician by the name of Orban Le Verrier did a beautifully

1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:31.500
 sophisticated calculation which said if this is due to gravity of a more distant planet,

1:12:31.500 --> 1:12:34.080
 then that planet is there, okay?

1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:35.560
 And then they found it.

1:12:35.560 --> 1:12:42.980
 But the point is the understanding of where to look for Neptune came entirely out of celestial

1:12:42.980 --> 1:12:43.980
 mechanics.

1:12:43.980 --> 1:12:49.360
 The case with Planet Nine is a little bit different because what we can do I think relatively

1:12:49.360 --> 1:12:52.060
 well is predict the orbit and mass of Planet Nine.

1:12:52.060 --> 1:12:54.820
 We cannot tell you where it is on its orbit.

1:12:54.820 --> 1:13:02.200
 The reason is we haven't seen the Kuiper Belt objects complete an orbit, their own orbit,

1:13:02.200 --> 1:13:04.720
 even once because it takes 4,000 years.

1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:13.220
 But I plan to live on as an AI being, and I'll be tracking those orbits as, you know,

1:13:13.220 --> 1:13:14.220
 for…

1:13:14.220 --> 1:13:15.220
 So it takes 4,000 or 5,000 years.

1:13:15.220 --> 1:13:16.220
 I mean, it doesn't have to be AI.

1:13:16.220 --> 1:13:17.220
 It could be longevity.

1:13:17.220 --> 1:13:19.740
 There's a lot of really exciting genetic engineering research.

1:13:19.740 --> 1:13:25.900
 So you'll just be a brain waiting for the, your brain waiting for the orbit to complete

1:13:25.900 --> 1:13:27.900
 for the basic Kuiper Belt objects.

1:13:27.900 --> 1:13:28.900
 That's right.

1:13:28.900 --> 1:13:34.860
 That's like kind of the worst reason to want to live a long time, right, just like can

1:13:34.860 --> 1:13:36.380
 the brain like smoke a cigarette?

1:13:36.380 --> 1:13:37.380
 I know, right?

1:13:37.380 --> 1:13:44.020
 Can you just like light one up while you're waiting or?

1:13:44.020 --> 1:13:52.420
 But you're making me actually realize that the one way to explore the galaxy is by just

1:13:52.420 --> 1:13:54.660
 sitting here on Earth and waiting.

1:13:54.660 --> 1:13:59.460
 So if we can just get really good at waiting, it's like a mua mua or these interstellar

1:13:59.460 --> 1:14:02.980
 objects that fly in, you can just wait for them to come to you.

1:14:02.980 --> 1:14:03.980
 Same with the aliens.

1:14:03.980 --> 1:14:05.180
 You can wait for them to come to you.

1:14:05.180 --> 1:14:11.340
 If you get really good at waiting, then that's one way to do the exploration because eventually

1:14:11.340 --> 1:14:12.660
 the thing will come to you.

1:14:12.660 --> 1:14:18.680
 Maybe that's the, maybe the intelligent alien civilizations get much better at waiting,

1:14:18.680 --> 1:14:23.140
 and so they all decide, so game theoretically, to start waiting, and it's just a bunch of

1:14:23.140 --> 1:14:27.460
 like ancient intelligent civilizations of aliens all throughout the universe, they're

1:14:27.460 --> 1:14:29.420
 just sitting there waiting for each other.

1:14:29.420 --> 1:14:31.780
 Look, you can't just be good at waiting.

1:14:31.780 --> 1:14:33.580
 You gotta know how to chill, okay?

1:14:33.580 --> 1:14:36.280
 Like you can't just like sit around and do nothing.

1:14:36.280 --> 1:14:38.260
 You gotta be, you gotta know how to chill.

1:14:38.260 --> 1:14:45.940
 I honestly think that as we progress, if the aliens are anything like us, we enjoy loving

1:14:45.940 --> 1:14:52.820
 things we do, and it's very possible that we just figure out mechanisms here on Earth

1:14:52.820 --> 1:14:58.380
 to enjoy our life, and we just stay here on Earth forever, that exploration becomes less

1:14:58.380 --> 1:15:03.420
 and less of an interesting thing to do, and so you basically, yes, wait and chill.

1:15:03.420 --> 1:15:09.440
 You get really optimally good at chilling, and thereby exploring is not that interesting,

1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:13.100
 so in terms of 4,000 years, it would be nothing for scientists.

1:15:13.100 --> 1:15:18.340
 We'll be chilling and just all kinds of scientific explorations will become possible because

1:15:18.340 --> 1:15:20.020
 we'll just be here on Earth.

1:15:20.020 --> 1:15:21.020
 So chill.

1:15:21.020 --> 1:15:22.020
 So chill.

1:15:22.020 --> 1:15:26.060
 You have a paper out recently, because you already mentioned some of these ideas, but

1:15:26.060 --> 1:15:28.100
 I'd love it if you could dig into it a little bit.

1:15:28.100 --> 1:15:29.100
 Yeah, of course.

1:15:29.100 --> 1:15:35.100
 The injection of inner Oort Cloud objects into the distant Kuiper Belt by Planet Nine.

1:15:35.100 --> 1:15:40.820
 What is this idea of Planet Nine injecting objects into the Kuiper Belt?

1:15:40.820 --> 1:15:47.740
 Okay, let me take a brief step back, and when we do calculations of Planet Nine, when we

1:15:47.740 --> 1:15:57.380
 do the simulations, as far as our simulations are concerned, sort of the Neptune, like kind

1:15:57.380 --> 1:16:05.300
 of the transneptunian solar system is entirely sourced from the inside, namely the Kuiper

1:16:05.300 --> 1:16:10.840
 Belt gets scattered by Neptune, and then Planet Nine does things to it and aligns the orbits

1:16:10.840 --> 1:16:17.060
 and so on, and then we calculate what happens on the lifetime of the solar system, yada,

1:16:17.060 --> 1:16:18.580
 yada, yada.

1:16:18.580 --> 1:16:23.100
 During the pandemic, one of the kind of questions we asked ourselves, and this is indeed something

1:16:23.100 --> 1:16:31.460
 we, Mike and I, Mike Brown, who's a partner in crime on this, and I do regularly, is we

1:16:31.460 --> 1:16:39.300
 say how can we A, disprove ourselves, and B, how can we improve our simulations?

1:16:39.300 --> 1:16:40.940
 Like what's missing?

1:16:40.940 --> 1:16:46.780
 One idea that maybe should have been obvious in retrospect is that all of our simulations

1:16:46.780 --> 1:16:50.820
 treated the solar system as some isolated creature, right?

1:16:50.820 --> 1:16:53.420
 But the solar system did not form in isolation, right?

1:16:53.420 --> 1:16:59.780
 It formed in this cluster of stars, and during that phase of forming together with thousands

1:16:59.780 --> 1:17:06.540
 of other stars, we believe the solar system formed this almost spherical population of

1:17:06.540 --> 1:17:16.980
 icy debris that sits maybe at a few thousand times the separation between the Earth and

1:17:16.980 --> 1:17:20.420
 the Sun, maybe even a little bit closer.

1:17:20.420 --> 1:17:25.900
 If Planet Nine's not there, that population is completely dormant, and these objects just

1:17:25.900 --> 1:17:29.620
 slowly orbit the Sun.

1:17:29.620 --> 1:17:34.940
 Nothing interesting happens to them ever, but when we realize that if Planet Nine is

1:17:34.940 --> 1:17:39.340
 there, Planet Nine can actually grab some of those objects and gravitationally reinject

1:17:39.340 --> 1:17:42.740
 them into the distant solar system.

1:17:42.740 --> 1:17:46.740
 So we thought, okay, let's look into this with numerical experiments.

1:17:46.740 --> 1:17:53.020
 Do our simulations, does this process work, and if it works, what are its consequences?

1:17:53.020 --> 1:18:01.460
 So it turns out, indeed, not only does Planet Nine inject these distant inner Oort cloud

1:18:01.460 --> 1:18:09.340
 objects into the Kuiper Belt, they follow roughly the same pathway as the objects that

1:18:09.340 --> 1:18:10.940
 are being scattered out.

1:18:10.940 --> 1:18:15.140
 So there's this kind of river, two way river of material.

1:18:15.140 --> 1:18:20.700
 Some of it is coming out by Neptune scattering, some of it is moving in.

1:18:20.700 --> 1:18:27.420
 And if you work through the numbers, you kind of, at the end of the day, it has an effect

1:18:27.420 --> 1:18:30.060
 on the best fit orbit for Planet Nine itself.

1:18:30.060 --> 1:18:35.860
 So if you realize that the data set that we're observing is not entirely composed of things

1:18:35.860 --> 1:18:41.140
 that came out of the solar system, but also things that got reinjected back in, then turns

1:18:41.140 --> 1:18:44.140
 out the best fit Planet Nine is slightly more eccentric.

1:18:44.140 --> 1:18:46.540
 That's kind of getting into the weeds.

1:18:46.540 --> 1:18:53.780
 The point here is that the existence of Planet Nine itself provides this natural bridge that

1:18:53.780 --> 1:18:58.580
 connects an otherwise dormant population of icy debris of the solar system with things

1:18:58.580 --> 1:19:00.180
 that we're starting to directly observe.

1:19:00.180 --> 1:19:04.660
 So it can flow back, so it's not just a river flowing one way, it's maybe a smaller stream

1:19:04.660 --> 1:19:05.660
 going back.

1:19:05.660 --> 1:19:06.660
 Backwash.

1:19:06.660 --> 1:19:10.880
 You want a backwash, you want to incorporate that into the simulations, into your understanding

1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:15.040
 of those distant objects when you're trying to make sense of the various observations

1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:16.040
 and so on.

1:19:16.040 --> 1:19:17.040
 Exactly.

1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:18.040
 That's fascinating.

1:19:18.040 --> 1:19:24.460
 I gotta ask you, some people think that many of the observations that you're describing

1:19:24.460 --> 1:19:28.900
 could be described by a primordial black hole.

1:19:28.900 --> 1:19:33.420
 First, what is a primordial black hole and what do you think about this idea?

1:19:33.420 --> 1:19:39.580
 So primordial black hole is a black hole which is made not through the usual pathway of making

1:19:39.580 --> 1:19:48.860
 a black hole, which is that you have a star, which is more massive than 1.4 or so solar

1:19:48.860 --> 1:19:56.700
 masses and basically when it runs out of fuel, runs out of its nuclear fusion fuel, it can't

1:19:56.700 --> 1:20:01.740
 hold itself up anymore and just the whole thing collapses on itself, right?

1:20:01.740 --> 1:20:09.100
 You create a, I mean one, I guess, simple way to think about it is you create an object

1:20:09.100 --> 1:20:16.500
 with zero radius, that has mass but zero radius, that singularity.

1:20:16.500 --> 1:20:20.020
 Now such black holes exist all over the place.

1:20:20.020 --> 1:20:25.980
 In the galaxy, there's in fact a really big one at the center of the galaxy that's like,

1:20:25.980 --> 1:20:31.100
 that one's always looking at you when you're not looking, okay, and it's always talking

1:20:31.100 --> 1:20:32.100
 about you.

1:20:32.100 --> 1:20:34.940
 And when you turn off the lights, it wakes up.

1:20:34.940 --> 1:20:37.600
 That's right.

1:20:37.600 --> 1:20:40.580
 So such black holes are all over the place.

1:20:40.580 --> 1:20:45.700
 When they merge, we get to see incredible gravitational waves that they emit, etc, etc.

1:20:45.700 --> 1:20:50.780
 One kind of plausible scenario, however, is that when the universe was forming, basically

1:20:50.780 --> 1:20:59.740
 during the Big Bang, you created a whole spectrum of black holes, some with masses of five Earth

1:20:59.740 --> 1:21:05.700
 masses, some with masses of 10 Earth masses, like the entire, you know, mass spectrum size,

1:21:05.700 --> 1:21:08.940
 some the massive asteroids.

1:21:08.940 --> 1:21:14.340
 Now on the smaller end, over the lifetime of the universe, the smaller ones kind of

1:21:14.340 --> 1:21:16.780
 evaporate and they're not there anymore.

1:21:16.780 --> 1:21:21.500
 At least this is what we, what the calculations tell us.

1:21:21.500 --> 1:21:25.060
 But five Earth masses is big enough to not have evaporated.

1:21:25.060 --> 1:21:33.500
 So one idea is that Planet Nine is not a planet and instead it is a five Earth mass black

1:21:33.500 --> 1:21:34.980
 hole.

1:21:34.980 --> 1:21:37.020
 And that's why it's hard to find.

1:21:37.020 --> 1:21:45.260
 Now can we right away from our calculations say that's definitely true or that's not true?

1:21:45.260 --> 1:21:46.260
 Absolutely not.

1:21:46.260 --> 1:21:53.700
 We can't, in fact, our calculations tell you nothing other than the orbit and the mass.

1:21:53.700 --> 1:21:59.760
 And that means the black hole, I mean, it could be a five Earth mass, you know, cup.

1:21:59.760 --> 1:22:04.660
 It could be a five Earth mass hedgehog or a black hole or really anything that's five

1:22:04.660 --> 1:22:10.220
 Earth masses will do because the gravity of a black hole is no different than the gravity

1:22:10.220 --> 1:22:11.740
 of a planet, right?

1:22:11.740 --> 1:22:17.660
 If the sun became a black hole tomorrow, it would be dark, but the Earth would keep orbiting

1:22:17.660 --> 1:22:18.660
 it.

1:22:18.660 --> 1:22:23.300
 And like this notion that, oh, black holes suck everything in, it's not, that's like

1:22:23.300 --> 1:22:24.300
 a sci fi notion.

1:22:24.300 --> 1:22:25.300
 All right.

1:22:25.300 --> 1:22:26.300
 It's just mass.

1:22:26.300 --> 1:22:32.780
 What would be the difference between a black hole and a planet in terms of observationally?

1:22:32.780 --> 1:22:37.180
 Probably the difference would be that you will never find the black hole, right?

1:22:37.180 --> 1:22:43.060
 The truth is they're kind of, I'm actually not, you know, I never looked into this very

1:22:43.060 --> 1:22:49.740
 carefully, but there are some constraints that you can get just statistically and say,

1:22:49.740 --> 1:22:56.060
 okay, if the sun has a binary companion, which is a five Earth mass black hole, then that

1:22:56.060 --> 1:23:01.500
 means such black holes would be extremely common and, you know, you can sort of look

1:23:01.500 --> 1:23:05.260
 for lensing events and then you say, okay, maybe that's not so likely.

1:23:05.260 --> 1:23:12.120
 But you know, that said, I want to emphasize that there's a limit to what our calculations

1:23:12.120 --> 1:23:13.120
 can tell you.

1:23:13.120 --> 1:23:14.680
 That's the orbit and the mass.

1:23:14.680 --> 1:23:20.900
 So I think there's a bunch, like Ed Witten, I think wishes it's a black hole because I

1:23:20.900 --> 1:23:26.580
 think one exciting things about black holes in our solar system is that we could go there

1:23:26.580 --> 1:23:31.060
 and we can maybe study the singularity somehow because that allows us to understand some

1:23:31.060 --> 1:23:33.340
 fundamental things about physics.

1:23:33.340 --> 1:23:39.840
 If it's a planet, so planet nine, we may not, you know, and we go there, we may not discover

1:23:39.840 --> 1:23:43.220
 anything profoundly new.

1:23:43.220 --> 1:23:47.620
 The interesting thing, perhaps you can correct me about planet nine is like the big picture

1:23:47.620 --> 1:23:48.620
 of it.

1:23:48.620 --> 1:23:52.260
 The whole big story of the Kuiper belt and all those kinds of things.

1:23:52.260 --> 1:23:58.900
 It's not that planet nine would be somehow fundamentally different from, I don't know,

1:23:58.900 --> 1:24:03.700
 Neptune in terms of, in terms of the kind of things we could learn from it.

1:24:03.700 --> 1:24:07.580
 So I think that there's kind of a hope that it's a black hole because it's an entirely

1:24:07.580 --> 1:24:09.020
 new kind of object.

1:24:09.020 --> 1:24:11.020
 Maybe you can correct me on that.

1:24:11.020 --> 1:24:12.020
 Yeah.

1:24:12.020 --> 1:24:18.060
 I mean, of course here, my own biases creep in because I'm interested, you know, in planets

1:24:18.060 --> 1:24:19.960
 around other stars.

1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:26.060
 And I would say, I would disagree that, you know, we wouldn't find things that would be

1:24:26.060 --> 1:24:33.680
 truly, you know, fundamentally new because as it turns out, the galaxy is really good

1:24:33.680 --> 1:24:38.620
 at making five or three earth mass objects, right?

1:24:38.620 --> 1:24:45.160
 The most common type of planet that we see, that we, you know, discover orbiting around

1:24:45.160 --> 1:24:47.800
 other stars is a few earth masses.

1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:50.020
 In the solar system, there's no analog for that, right?

1:24:50.020 --> 1:24:56.020
 We go from one earth mass object, which is this one and to skipping to Neptune and Uranus,

1:24:56.020 --> 1:25:01.280
 which themselves are actually relatively poorly understood, especially Uranus from the interior

1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:03.920
 structure point of view.

1:25:03.920 --> 1:25:09.520
 If planet nine is a planet, going there will give us the closest window into understanding

1:25:09.520 --> 1:25:12.220
 what other planets look like.

1:25:12.220 --> 1:25:18.860
 And I will, you know, I'll say this, that, you know, planets kind of in terms of their

1:25:18.860 --> 1:25:26.020
 complexity on some logarithmic scale fall somewhere between a star and an insect, right?

1:25:26.020 --> 1:25:30.940
 An insect is way more complicated than a star, right?

1:25:30.940 --> 1:25:37.240
 Just all kinds of physical processes and really biochemical processes that occur inside of

1:25:37.240 --> 1:25:43.800
 an insect that just make a star look like, you know, somebody is like playing with a

1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:45.500
 spring or something, right?

1:25:45.500 --> 1:25:53.580
 So the, I think, you know, it would be, you know, arguably, you know, more interesting

1:25:53.580 --> 1:25:59.380
 to go to, you know, to go to planet nine if it's a planet, because black holes are simple.

1:25:59.380 --> 1:26:04.500
 They're just kind of, they're basically macroscopic like particles, right?

1:26:04.500 --> 1:26:05.500
 Yeah.

1:26:05.500 --> 1:26:08.060
 And so just like a star that you mentioned in terms of complexity.

1:26:08.060 --> 1:26:14.100
 So it's possible that planet nine is supposed to being like homogeneous is like super like

1:26:14.100 --> 1:26:18.220
 heterogeneous is a bunch of cool stuff going on that could give us an intuition.

1:26:18.220 --> 1:26:24.580
 I never thought about that, that it's basically Earth number two in terms of size and gives

1:26:24.580 --> 1:26:30.500
 us, starts giving us intuition that could be generalizable to Earth like planets elsewhere

1:26:30.500 --> 1:26:31.500
 in the galaxy.

1:26:31.500 --> 1:26:37.220
 I mean, yeah, Pluto is also in the sense like, you know, Pluto is a tiny, tiny thing, right?

1:26:37.220 --> 1:26:41.380
 Just like you would imagine that it's just a tiny ball of ice, like who cares, but the

1:26:41.380 --> 1:26:47.260
 New Horizons images of Pluto reveal so much remarkable structure, right?

1:26:47.260 --> 1:26:51.860
 They reveal glaciers flowing and these are glaciers not made out of water ice, but you

1:26:51.860 --> 1:27:00.340
 know, CO ice, it turns out at those temperatures, right, of like 40 or so Kelvin, water ice

1:27:00.340 --> 1:27:01.340
 looks like metal, right?

1:27:01.340 --> 1:27:07.380
 It just doesn't flow at all, but then ice made up of carbon monoxide starts to flow.

1:27:07.380 --> 1:27:14.180
 I mean, there's just like all kinds of really cool phenomena that you otherwise just wouldn't

1:27:14.180 --> 1:27:17.180
 really even imagine that occur.

1:27:17.180 --> 1:27:20.620
 So yeah, I mean, there's a reason why I like planets.

1:27:20.620 --> 1:27:28.720
 Well, let me ask you, I find as I read the idea that Ed Witten was thinking about this

1:27:28.720 --> 1:27:30.060
 kind of stuff fascinating.

1:27:30.060 --> 1:27:37.420
 So he's a mathematical physicist who's very interested in string theory, won the Fields

1:27:37.420 --> 1:27:41.460
 Medal for his work in mathematics.

1:27:41.460 --> 1:27:47.260
 So I read that he proposed a fleet of probes accelerated by radiation pressure that could

1:27:47.260 --> 1:27:50.580
 discover a Planet Nine primordial black holes location.

1:27:50.580 --> 1:27:55.980
 What do you think about this idea of sending a bunch of probes out there?

1:27:55.980 --> 1:28:00.820
 Yeah, look, the way the idea is a cool one, right?

1:28:00.820 --> 1:28:06.920
 You go and you say, you know, launch them basically, isotropically, you track where

1:28:06.920 --> 1:28:07.920
 they go.

1:28:07.920 --> 1:28:15.260
 And if I understand the idea correctly, basically measure the deflection and you say, okay,

1:28:15.260 --> 1:28:21.620
 that must be something there since the probe trajectories are being altered.

1:28:21.620 --> 1:28:26.420
 Oh, so the measurement, the basic sensory mechanism is the, it's not like you have senses

1:28:26.420 --> 1:28:27.420
 on the probes.

1:28:27.420 --> 1:28:32.300
 It's more like you're, because you're very precisely able to capture, to measure the

1:28:32.300 --> 1:28:35.780
 trajectory of the probes, you can then infer the gravitational fields.

1:28:35.780 --> 1:28:39.960
 I think that's the basic idea.

1:28:39.960 --> 1:28:46.500
 You know, back a few years ago, we had conversations like these with, you know, engineers from

1:28:46.500 --> 1:28:47.960
 JPL.

1:28:47.960 --> 1:28:55.120
 They more or less convinced me that this is more, much more difficult than it seems because

1:28:55.120 --> 1:28:58.820
 you don't, at that level of precision, right?

1:28:58.820 --> 1:29:00.980
 Things like solar flares matter, right?

1:29:00.980 --> 1:29:03.740
 Solar flares, right, are completely chaotic.

1:29:03.740 --> 1:29:07.260
 You can't predict which, where a solar flare will happen.

1:29:07.260 --> 1:29:10.580
 That will drive radiation pressure gradients.

1:29:10.580 --> 1:29:12.640
 You don't know where every single asteroid is.

1:29:12.640 --> 1:29:20.900
 So like actually doing that problem, I think it's possible, but it's not a trivial matter,

1:29:20.900 --> 1:29:21.900
 right?

1:29:21.900 --> 1:29:28.380
 Well, I wonder, not just about Planet 9, I wonder if that's kind of the future of doing

1:29:28.380 --> 1:29:33.420
 science in our solar system is to just launch a huge number of probes.

1:29:33.420 --> 1:29:39.820
 So like a whole order of magnitude, many orders of magnitude, larger numbers of probes, and

1:29:39.820 --> 1:29:44.620
 then starting for a bunch of different stuff, not just gravity, but everything else.

1:29:44.620 --> 1:29:50.420
 So in this regard, I actually think there is a huge revolution that's to some extent

1:29:50.420 --> 1:29:52.100
 already started, right?

1:29:52.100 --> 1:29:57.740
 The standard kind of like timescale for a NASA mission is that you like propose it and

1:29:57.740 --> 1:30:01.980
 it launches, I don't know, like 150 years after your proposal.

1:30:01.980 --> 1:30:08.860
 I'm over exaggerating, but you know, it's just like some huge development cycle and

1:30:08.860 --> 1:30:15.900
 it gets delayed 55 times, like that is not going away, right?

1:30:15.900 --> 1:30:20.340
 The really cutting edge things, you have to do it this way because you don't know what

1:30:20.340 --> 1:30:22.300
 you're building, so to speak.

1:30:22.300 --> 1:30:32.040
 But the CubeSat kind of world is starting to provide an avenue for like launching something

1:30:32.040 --> 1:30:37.980
 that costs a few million dollars and has a turnaround timescale of like a couple of years.

1:30:37.980 --> 1:30:44.260
 You can imagine doing PhD theses where you design the mission, the mission goes to where

1:30:44.260 --> 1:30:49.520
 you're going, and you do the science all within a time span of five, six years.

1:30:49.520 --> 1:30:56.220
 That has not been fully executed on yet, but I absolutely think that's on the horizon and

1:30:56.220 --> 1:30:59.980
 we're not talking a decade, I think we're talking like this decade.

1:30:59.980 --> 1:31:07.660
 Yeah, and the company is accelerating all this with Blue Origin and SpaceX, and there's

1:31:07.660 --> 1:31:12.380
 a bunch of more CubeSat oriented companies that are pushing this forward.

1:31:12.380 --> 1:31:17.740
 Well let me ask you on that topic, what do you think about either one?

1:31:17.740 --> 1:31:24.420
 Elon Musk with SpaceX going to Mars, I think he wants SpaceX to be the first to put a first

1:31:24.420 --> 1:31:33.380
 human on Mars, and then Jeff Bezos, gotta give him props, wants to be the first to fly

1:31:33.380 --> 1:31:38.060
 his own rocket out into space.

1:31:38.060 --> 1:31:43.020
 Wasn't there a guy who like built his rocket out of garbage?

1:31:43.020 --> 1:31:47.580
 This was like a couple years ago, and somewhere in the desert he launched himself.

1:31:47.580 --> 1:31:52.340
 I'm not tracking this closely, but I think I am familiar with folks who built their own

1:31:52.340 --> 1:31:54.660
 rocket to try to prove the earth is flat.

1:31:54.660 --> 1:32:00.540
 Yes, that's the guy I'm talking about, he also jumped some limousine.

1:32:00.540 --> 1:32:09.940
 Truly revolutionary mind, you have to have greater men than either you or I.

1:32:09.940 --> 1:32:17.380
 It's been astonishing to watch how really over the last decade the commercial sector

1:32:17.380 --> 1:32:27.740
 took over this industry that traditionally has really been a government thing to do.

1:32:27.740 --> 1:32:34.020
 Motivated primarily by the competition between nations, like the Cold War, and now it's motivated

1:32:34.020 --> 1:32:39.380
 more and more by the natural forces of capitalism.

1:32:39.380 --> 1:32:43.860
 That's right, so here I have many ideas about it.

1:32:43.860 --> 1:32:51.780
 I think on the one hand, like what SpaceX has been able to do, for example, phenomenal.

1:32:51.780 --> 1:32:57.980
 If that brings down the price of space exploration, that turnaround time scale for space exploration,

1:32:57.980 --> 1:33:06.580
 which I think it inevitably will, that's a huge boost to the human condition.

1:33:06.580 --> 1:33:14.220
 The same time, if we're talking astronomy, it comes at a huge cost, and the Starlink

1:33:14.220 --> 1:33:16.660
 satellites is a great example of that cost.

1:33:16.660 --> 1:33:26.480
 In fact, I was just camping in the Mojave with a friend of mine, and they saw this string

1:33:26.480 --> 1:33:32.780
 of satellites just kind of appear and then disappear into nowhere.

1:33:32.780 --> 1:33:39.860
 That is beginning to interfere with Earth based observations, so I think there's tremendous

1:33:39.860 --> 1:33:45.020
 potential there, it's also important to be responsible about how it's executed.

1:33:45.020 --> 1:33:53.520
 Now with Mars and the whole idea of exploring Mars, I don't have strong opinions on whether

1:33:53.520 --> 1:34:05.260
 a manned mission is required or not required, but I do think the thing to keep in mind is

1:34:05.260 --> 1:34:13.260
 that I'm not signed on, if you will, to the idea that Mars is some kind of a safe haven

1:34:13.260 --> 1:34:17.980
 that we can escape to.

1:34:17.980 --> 1:34:19.780
 Mars sucks.

1:34:19.780 --> 1:34:26.420
 Living on Mars, if you want to live on Mars, you can have that experience by going to the

1:34:26.420 --> 1:34:31.780
 Mojave Desert and camping, and it's just not a great experience.

1:34:31.780 --> 1:34:35.500
 Well it's interesting, but there's something captivating about that kind of mission of

1:34:35.500 --> 1:34:43.940
 us striving out into space, and by making Mars in some ways habitable for at least like

1:34:43.940 --> 1:34:51.100
 months at a time, I think would lead to engineering breakthroughs that would make life in many

1:34:51.100 --> 1:34:52.500
 ways much better on Earth.

1:34:52.500 --> 1:34:58.180
 It will come up with ideas we totally don't expect yet, both on the robotics side, on

1:34:58.180 --> 1:35:06.540
 the food engineering side, on the, maybe we'll switch from, there'll be huge breakthroughs

1:35:06.540 --> 1:35:14.860
 in insect farming, as exciting as I find that idea to be, in the ways we consume protein.

1:35:14.860 --> 1:35:22.140
 Maybe it'll revolutionize, we do factory farming, which is full of cruelty and torture of animals,

1:35:22.140 --> 1:35:27.820
 we'll revolutionize that completely because of our, we shouldn't need to go to Mars to

1:35:27.820 --> 1:35:32.580
 revolutionize life here on Earth, but at the same time, I shouldn't need a deadline to

1:35:32.580 --> 1:35:35.100
 get shit done, but I do need it.

1:35:35.100 --> 1:35:37.580
 And then in the same way, I think we need Mars.

1:35:37.580 --> 1:35:41.060
 There's something about the human spirit that loves that longing for exploration.

1:35:41.060 --> 1:35:51.900
 I agree with that thesis, the going to the moon, right, and that whole endeavor has captivated

1:35:51.900 --> 1:35:59.780
 the imagination of so many, and it has led to incredible ideas, really, and probably

1:35:59.780 --> 1:36:05.420
 in nonlinear ways, not like, okay, we went to the moon, therefore some person here has

1:36:05.420 --> 1:36:07.180
 thought of this.

1:36:07.180 --> 1:36:15.760
 In that similar sense, I think space exploration is, there's some real magnetism about it,

1:36:15.760 --> 1:36:17.680
 and it's on a genetic level.

1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:25.460
 We have this need to keep exploring when we're done with a certain frontier, we move on to

1:36:25.460 --> 1:36:26.460
 the next frontier.

1:36:26.460 --> 1:36:32.860
 All that I'm saying is that I'm not moving to Mars to live there permanently ever, and

1:36:32.860 --> 1:36:39.540
 I think that, I'm glad you noted the kind of degradation of the Earth.

1:36:39.540 --> 1:36:44.620
 I think that is a true kind of the leading order challenge of our time.

1:36:44.620 --> 1:36:48.180
 That's a great engineering, that's a bunch of engineering problems.

1:36:48.180 --> 1:36:53.980
 I'm most interested in space, because as I've read extensively, it's apparently very difficult

1:36:53.980 --> 1:36:59.020
 to have sex in space, and so I just want that problem to be solved, because I think once

1:36:59.020 --> 1:37:04.620
 we solve the sex in space problem, we'll revolutionize sex here on Earth, thereby increasing the

1:37:04.620 --> 1:37:08.980
 fun on Earth, and the consequences of that can only be good.

1:37:08.980 --> 1:37:14.220
 I mean, you can, you've got a clear plan, right, and it sounds like, you know.

1:37:14.220 --> 1:37:16.420
 I'm submitting proposals to NASA as we speak.

1:37:16.420 --> 1:37:17.420
 That's right.

1:37:17.420 --> 1:37:21.020
 I keep getting rejected, I don't know why.

1:37:21.020 --> 1:37:22.020
 Okay.

1:37:22.020 --> 1:37:24.460
 You need better diagrams.

1:37:24.460 --> 1:37:25.460
 Better pictures.

1:37:25.460 --> 1:37:26.660
 I should have thought of that.

1:37:26.660 --> 1:37:30.980
 You a while ago mentioned that, you know, there's certain aspects in the history of

1:37:30.980 --> 1:37:38.260
 the solar system and Earth that resulted, it could have resulted in an opaque atmosphere,

1:37:38.260 --> 1:37:43.100
 but it didn't, we couldn't see the stars.

1:37:43.100 --> 1:37:47.580
 And somebody mentioned to me a little bit ago, and it's almost like a philosophical

1:37:47.580 --> 1:37:49.320
 question for you.

1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:58.700
 Do you think humans, like human society would develop as it did, or at all, if we couldn't

1:37:58.700 --> 1:37:59.940
 see the stars?

1:37:59.940 --> 1:38:03.060
 It would be drastically different.

1:38:03.060 --> 1:38:05.260
 Just if it ever did develop.

1:38:05.260 --> 1:38:12.540
 So I think some of the early developments, right, of like, you know, fire, you know.

1:38:12.540 --> 1:38:16.020
 First of all, that atmosphere would be so hot, because, you know, if you have an opaque

1:38:16.020 --> 1:38:22.260
 atmosphere, the temperature at the bottom is huge.

1:38:22.260 --> 1:38:25.860
 So we would be very different beings to start with.

1:38:25.860 --> 1:38:26.860
 We'd have very different.

1:38:26.860 --> 1:38:29.420
 It could be cloudy in certain kinds of ways that you could still get.

1:38:29.420 --> 1:38:30.420
 Okay.

1:38:30.420 --> 1:38:32.380
 Think about like a greenhouse, right?

1:38:32.380 --> 1:38:37.780
 A greenhouse is cloudy, effectively, but it's super hot.

1:38:37.780 --> 1:38:38.780
 Yeah.

1:38:38.780 --> 1:38:41.300
 It's hard to avoid having an atmosphere.

1:38:41.300 --> 1:38:44.620
 If you have an opaque atmosphere, it's hard to, right.

1:38:44.620 --> 1:38:46.580
 Venus is a great example, right?

1:38:46.580 --> 1:38:52.940
 Venus is, I don't remember exactly how many degrees, but it's hundreds in Celsius, right?

1:38:52.940 --> 1:38:55.460
 It's not a hundred, it's hundreds.

1:38:55.460 --> 1:38:59.740
 Even though it's only a little bit closer to the sun, that temperature is entirely coming

1:38:59.740 --> 1:39:01.820
 from the fact that the atmosphere is thick.

1:39:01.820 --> 1:39:03.580
 So it's just a sauna of sorts.

1:39:03.580 --> 1:39:04.580
 Yeah.

1:39:04.580 --> 1:39:05.580
 Yeah.

1:39:05.580 --> 1:39:08.740
 You go there, you know, you feel refreshed after you come back, you know.

1:39:08.740 --> 1:39:13.060
 But if you stay there, I mean, so, okay, take that as an assumption.

1:39:13.060 --> 1:39:15.500
 This is a philosophical question, not a biological one.

1:39:15.500 --> 1:39:18.980
 So you have a life that develops under these extremely hot conditions.

1:39:18.980 --> 1:39:19.980
 Yeah.

1:39:19.980 --> 1:39:20.980
 So let's see.

1:39:20.980 --> 1:39:28.620
 So much of the early evolution of mankind was driven by exploration, right?

1:39:28.620 --> 1:39:37.060
 And the kind of interest in stars originated in part as a tool to guide that exploration,

1:39:37.060 --> 1:39:38.060
 right?

1:39:38.060 --> 1:39:44.420
 I mean, that in itself, I think would be a huge, you know, a huge differential in the

1:39:44.420 --> 1:39:48.700
 way that we, you know, our evolution on this planet.

1:39:48.700 --> 1:39:49.700
 Yeah.

1:39:49.700 --> 1:39:51.560
 I mean, stars, that's brilliant.

1:39:51.560 --> 1:39:59.360
 So even in that aspect, but even in further aspects, astronomy just shows up in basically

1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:04.420
 every single development in the history of science up until the 20th century, it shows

1:40:04.420 --> 1:40:05.500
 up.

1:40:05.500 --> 1:40:10.340
 So I wonder without that, if we would have, if we would even get like calculus.

1:40:10.340 --> 1:40:14.780
 Yeah, look, that's a great, I mean, that's a great point.

1:40:14.780 --> 1:40:20.540
 Newton in part developed calculus because he was interested in understanding, explaining

1:40:20.540 --> 1:40:22.580
 Kepler's laws, right?

1:40:22.580 --> 1:40:29.300
 In general, that whole mechanistic understanding of the night sky, right, replacing a religious

1:40:29.300 --> 1:40:34.220
 understanding where you interpret, you know, this is, you know, this whatever fire god

1:40:34.220 --> 1:40:41.060
 riding his, you know, a little chariot across the sky, as opposed to, you know, this is

1:40:41.060 --> 1:40:48.460
 some mechanistic set of laws that transformed humanity and arguably put us on the course

1:40:48.460 --> 1:40:50.540
 that we're on today, right?

1:40:50.540 --> 1:40:57.140
 The entirety of the last 400 years and the development of kind of our technological world

1:40:57.140 --> 1:41:03.500
 that we live in today was sparked by that, right?

1:41:03.500 --> 1:41:08.900
 Understanding an effectively, you know, a non secular view of the natural world and

1:41:08.900 --> 1:41:15.860
 kind of saying, okay, this can be understood and if it can be understood, it can be utilized,

1:41:15.860 --> 1:41:19.140
 we can create our own variants of this.

1:41:19.140 --> 1:41:24.660
 Absolutely, we would be a very, very different species without astronomy.

1:41:24.660 --> 1:41:29.100
 This I think extends beyond just astronomy, right?

1:41:29.100 --> 1:41:35.180
 There are questions like why do we need to spend money on X, right?

1:41:35.180 --> 1:41:39.860
 Where X can be anything like paleontology, like, right?

1:41:39.860 --> 1:41:42.340
 The mating patterns of penguins.

1:41:42.340 --> 1:41:46.460
 Yeah, that's like, that's right.

1:41:46.460 --> 1:41:53.540
 I think, you know, there's a tremendous under appreciation for the usefulness of useless

1:41:53.540 --> 1:41:54.540
 knowledge, right?

1:41:54.540 --> 1:41:57.540
 I mean, that's brilliant.

1:41:57.540 --> 1:42:02.820
 I didn't come up with this, this is a little book by the guy who started the Institute

1:42:02.820 --> 1:42:10.500
 for Advanced Studies, but, you know, it's so true, so much of the electronics that are

1:42:10.500 --> 1:42:13.900
 on this table, right, work on Maxwell's equations.

1:42:13.900 --> 1:42:21.300
 Maxwell wasn't sitting around in the 1800s saying, you know, I hope one day, you know,

1:42:21.300 --> 1:42:27.460
 we'll make, you know, a couple mics so, you know, a couple, you know, a couple guys can

1:42:27.460 --> 1:42:30.780
 have this conversation, right?

1:42:30.780 --> 1:42:38.820
 That wasn't at no point was that the motivation, and yet, you know, it gave us the world that

1:42:38.820 --> 1:42:39.980
 we have today.

1:42:39.980 --> 1:42:45.380
 The answer is if you are a purely pragmatic person, if you don't care at all about kind

1:42:45.380 --> 1:42:53.780
 of the human condition, none of this, the answer is, you can tax it, right, like, useless

1:42:53.780 --> 1:43:00.900
 things have created way more capital than useful things.

1:43:00.900 --> 1:43:08.300
 And the sad thing, first of all, it's really important to think about, and it's brilliant

1:43:08.300 --> 1:43:13.820
 in the following context, like Neil deGrasse Tyson has this book about the role of military

1:43:13.820 --> 1:43:21.420
 based funding in the development of science, and then so much of technological breakthroughs

1:43:21.420 --> 1:43:28.460
 in the 20th century had to do with humans working on different military things.

1:43:28.460 --> 1:43:32.660
 And then the outcome of that had nothing to do with military, it had some military application,

1:43:32.660 --> 1:43:36.820
 but their impact was much, much bigger than military.

1:43:36.820 --> 1:43:41.600
 The splitting of the atom is a kind of a canonical example of this.

1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:47.860
 We all know the tragedy that, you know, arises from splitting of the atom, and yet, you know,

1:43:47.860 --> 1:43:55.420
 so much, I mean, the atom itself does not care for what purpose it is being split.

1:43:55.420 --> 1:44:02.140
 So I wonder if we took the same amount of funding as we used for war and poured it into

1:44:02.140 --> 1:44:06.980
 like totally seemingly useless things, like the mating patterns of penguins, we would

1:44:06.980 --> 1:44:08.500
 get the internet anyway.

1:44:08.500 --> 1:44:16.500
 I think so, I think so, and, you know, perhaps more of the internet would have penguins,

1:44:16.500 --> 1:44:17.500
 you know.

1:44:17.500 --> 1:44:23.420
 So we're both joking, but in some sense, like, I wonder, it's not the penguins, because penguins

1:44:23.420 --> 1:44:32.900
 is more about sort of biology, but all useless kind of tinkering and all kinds of avenues,

1:44:32.900 --> 1:44:40.160
 and also because military applications are often burdened by the secrecy required.

1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:46.980
 So it's often like so much, the openness is lacking, and if we've learned anything for

1:44:46.980 --> 1:44:52.580
 the last few decades is that when there's openness in science, that accelerates the

1:44:52.580 --> 1:44:53.740
 development of science.

1:44:53.740 --> 1:44:54.740
 That's right.

1:44:54.740 --> 1:44:55.740
 That's true.

1:44:55.740 --> 1:45:02.540
 That openness of science truly, you know, it benefits everybody, the notion that if,

1:45:02.540 --> 1:45:07.260
 you know, I share my science with you, then you're going to catch up and like know the

1:45:07.260 --> 1:45:08.900
 same thing.

1:45:08.900 --> 1:45:16.180
 That is a short sighted viewpoint, because if you catch up and you open, you know, you

1:45:16.180 --> 1:45:21.140
 discover something that puts me in a position to do the next step, right?

1:45:21.140 --> 1:45:25.740
 So I absolutely agree with all of this.

1:45:25.740 --> 1:45:32.740
 I mean, the kind of question of like military funding versus non military funding is obviously

1:45:32.740 --> 1:45:39.820
 a complicated one, but at the end of the day, I think we have to get over the notion as

1:45:39.820 --> 1:45:47.900
 a society that we are going to, you know, pay for this, and then we will get that, right?

1:45:47.900 --> 1:45:53.260
 That's true if you're buying like, I don't know, toilet paper or something, right?

1:45:53.260 --> 1:45:55.680
 It's just not true in the intellectual pursuit.

1:45:55.680 --> 1:46:00.460
 That's not how it works, and sometimes it'll fail, right?

1:46:00.460 --> 1:46:04.020
 Like sometimes, like a huge fraction of what I do, right?

1:46:04.020 --> 1:46:07.620
 I come up with an idea, I think, oh, it's great, and then I work it out, it's totally

1:46:07.620 --> 1:46:08.820
 not great, right?

1:46:08.820 --> 1:46:10.700
 It fails immediately.

1:46:10.700 --> 1:46:16.140
 Failure is not a sign that the initial pursuit was worthless, so failure is just part of

1:46:16.140 --> 1:46:21.060
 this kind of this whole exploration thing, and we should fund more and more of this exploration,

1:46:21.060 --> 1:46:22.060
 the variety of the exploration.

1:46:22.060 --> 1:46:23.060
 That's right.

1:46:23.060 --> 1:46:28.220
 I think it was Linus Pauling or somebody from, you know, that generation of scientists, you

1:46:28.220 --> 1:46:33.460
 know, a good way to have good ideas is to have a lot of ideas.

1:46:33.460 --> 1:46:34.460
 Yeah.

1:46:34.460 --> 1:46:37.080
 So I think that's true.

1:46:37.080 --> 1:46:42.100
 If you are conservative in your thinking, if you worry about proposing something that's

1:46:42.100 --> 1:46:48.220
 going to fail and, oh, what if, you know, like, there's no science police that's going

1:46:48.220 --> 1:46:54.060
 to come and arrest you for proposing the wrong thing, and, you know, it's also just like,

1:46:54.060 --> 1:47:01.020
 why would you do science if you're afraid of, you know, taking that step?

1:47:01.020 --> 1:47:07.140
 It'd be so much better to propose things that are plausible, that are interesting, and then

1:47:07.140 --> 1:47:11.660
 for a fraction of them to be wrong than to just kind of, you know, make incremental progress

1:47:11.660 --> 1:47:13.660
 all your life, right?

1:47:13.660 --> 1:47:19.060
 Speaking of wild ideas, let me ask you about the thing we mentioned previously, which is

1:47:19.060 --> 1:47:22.940
 this interstellar object Amuamua.

1:47:22.940 --> 1:47:27.400
 Could it be space junk from a distant alien civilization?

1:47:27.400 --> 1:47:33.940
 You can't immediately discount that by saying absolutely it cannot.

1:47:33.940 --> 1:47:34.940
 Anything can be space junk.

1:47:34.940 --> 1:47:41.300
 I mean, from that point of view, can any of the Kuiper Belt objects we see be space junk?

1:47:41.300 --> 1:47:44.940
 Everything on the night sky can, in principle, be space junk.

1:47:44.940 --> 1:47:49.700
 And Kuiper Belt would catch interstellar objects potentially and, like, force them into an

1:47:49.700 --> 1:47:52.100
 orbit if they're, like, small enough?

1:47:52.100 --> 1:47:57.300
 Not the Kuiper Belt itself, but you can imagine, like, Jupiter family comets being captured,

1:47:57.300 --> 1:47:58.300
 you know.

1:47:58.300 --> 1:48:00.840
 So you can actually capture things.

1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:05.220
 It's even easier to do this very early in the solar system, like, early in the solar

1:48:05.220 --> 1:48:09.420
 system's life while it's still in a cluster of stars.

1:48:09.420 --> 1:48:15.700
 It's unavoidable that you capture debris, whether it be natural debris or unnatural

1:48:15.700 --> 1:48:20.900
 debris, or just debris of some kind from other stars.

1:48:20.900 --> 1:48:22.460
 It's like a daycare center, right?

1:48:22.460 --> 1:48:25.700
 Like, everybody passes their infections on to other kids.

1:48:25.700 --> 1:48:26.700
 Yeah.

1:48:26.700 --> 1:48:31.940
 You know, Amuamua, there's been a lot of discussion about it, and there's been a lot of interest

1:48:31.940 --> 1:48:35.140
 in this over, like, is it aliens or is it not?

1:48:35.140 --> 1:48:39.460
 It's, like, if you just kind of look at the facts, like, what we know about it is it's

1:48:39.460 --> 1:48:44.380
 kind of, like, a weird shape, and it also accelerated, you know?

1:48:44.380 --> 1:48:45.380
 Right?

1:48:45.380 --> 1:48:50.820
 Like, that's the two, those are the two interesting things about it.

1:48:50.820 --> 1:49:02.460
 There are puzzles about it, and perhaps the most daring resolution to this puzzle is that

1:49:02.460 --> 1:49:07.380
 it's not, you know, aliens or it's not, like, a rock, it's actually a piece of hydrogen

1:49:07.380 --> 1:49:08.380
 ice.

1:49:08.380 --> 1:49:09.380
 Right?

1:49:09.380 --> 1:49:15.540
 So, this is a friend of mine, you know, Daryl Seligman, Greg Laughlin, came up with this

1:49:15.540 --> 1:49:22.900
 idea that in giant molecular clouds that are just clouds of hydrogen, helium, gas that

1:49:22.900 --> 1:49:31.700
 live throughout the galaxy, at their cores, you can condense ice to become these hydrogen,

1:49:31.700 --> 1:49:33.860
 you know, icebergs, if you will.

1:49:33.860 --> 1:49:41.620
 And then that explains many of the aspects of, in fact, I think that explains all of

1:49:41.620 --> 1:49:48.260
 the Oumuamua mystery, how it becomes elongated, because basically the hydrogen ice sublimates

1:49:48.260 --> 1:49:55.700
 and kind of like a bar of soap that, you know, slowly kind of elongates as you strip away

1:49:55.700 --> 1:50:03.140
 the surface layers, how it was able to accelerate because of a jet that is produced from, you

1:50:03.140 --> 1:50:06.820
 know, the hydrogen coming off of it, but you can't see it because it's hydrogen gas, like,

1:50:06.820 --> 1:50:12.620
 all of this stuff kind of falls together nicely.

1:50:12.620 --> 1:50:18.520
 I'm intrigued by that idea, truly, because it's like, if that's true, that's a new type

1:50:18.520 --> 1:50:21.320
 of astrophysical object.

1:50:21.320 --> 1:50:27.340
 And it would be produced by, what's the monster that produced it initially, that kind of object?

1:50:27.340 --> 1:50:30.380
 So these giant molecular clouds, they're everywhere.

1:50:30.380 --> 1:50:34.580
 I mean, the fact that they exist is not...

1:50:34.580 --> 1:50:37.540
 Are they rogue clouds or are they part of like an Oort cloud?

1:50:37.540 --> 1:50:38.540
 No, no, they're rogue clouds.

1:50:38.540 --> 1:50:39.540
 They're just floating about?

1:50:39.540 --> 1:50:47.260
 Yeah, so if you go, like, a lot of people imagine the galaxy as being a, you know, a

1:50:47.260 --> 1:50:50.860
 bunch of stars, right, and they're just orbiting, right?

1:50:50.860 --> 1:50:55.260
 But the truth is, if you fly between stars, you run into clouds.

1:50:55.260 --> 1:50:59.480
 They don't have any large object that creates orbits, so they're just floating about?

1:50:59.480 --> 1:51:00.480
 Just floating.

1:51:00.480 --> 1:51:01.480
 But why are they floating together?

1:51:01.480 --> 1:51:04.140
 Or they just float together for a time and not...

1:51:04.140 --> 1:51:08.880
 Well, so these eventually become the nurseries of stars.

1:51:08.880 --> 1:51:15.820
 So as they cool, they contract and, you know, then collapse into stars or into groups of

1:51:15.820 --> 1:51:16.820
 stars.

1:51:16.820 --> 1:51:24.380
 And some of them, the starless molecular clouds, according to the calculations that Daryl

1:51:24.380 --> 1:51:31.180
 and Greg did, can create these, like, icicles of hydrogen ice.

1:51:31.180 --> 1:51:35.980
 I wonder why they would be flying so fast, because they seem to be moving pretty fast

1:51:35.980 --> 1:51:36.980
 at a quick pace.

1:51:36.980 --> 1:51:37.980
 You mean Oumuamua?

1:51:37.980 --> 1:51:38.980
 Oumuamua, yeah.

1:51:38.980 --> 1:51:41.500
 Oh, that's just because of the acceleration due to the sun.

1:51:41.500 --> 1:51:48.220
 If you stop, it's like, take something really far away, let it go, and the sun is here.

1:51:48.220 --> 1:51:52.980
 By the time it comes close to the sun, right, it's moving pretty fast.

1:51:52.980 --> 1:51:59.060
 So that's an attractive explanation, I think, not so much because it's cool, but it makes

1:51:59.060 --> 1:52:06.980
 a clear prediction, right, of when Vera Rubin Observatory comes online next year or so.

1:52:06.980 --> 1:52:11.020
 We will discover many, many more of these objects, right?

1:52:11.020 --> 1:52:17.380
 And they have, so I like theories that are falsifiable.

1:52:17.380 --> 1:52:19.380
 Not just testable, but falsifiable.

1:52:19.380 --> 1:52:24.980
 It's good to have a falsifiable theory where you can say, that's not true.

1:52:24.980 --> 1:52:29.820
 Aliens is one that's fundamentally difficult to say, no, that's not aliens.

1:52:29.820 --> 1:52:35.900
 Well, the interesting thing to me, if you look at one alien civilization, and then we

1:52:35.900 --> 1:52:43.380
 look at the things it produces, in terms of if we were to try to detect the alien civilization,

1:52:43.380 --> 1:52:55.300
 there is like, say there's 10 billion aliens, there would probably be trillions of dumb

1:52:55.300 --> 1:53:01.380
 drone type things produced by the aliens, and then be many, many, many more orders of

1:53:01.380 --> 1:53:04.600
 magnitude of junk.

1:53:04.600 --> 1:53:09.900
 So if you were to look for an alien civilization, in my mind, you would be looking for the junk.

1:53:09.900 --> 1:53:12.340
 That's the more efficient thing to look for.

1:53:12.340 --> 1:53:19.100
 So I'm not saying Oumuamua has any characteristics of space junk, but it kind of opened my eyes

1:53:19.100 --> 1:53:25.520
 to the idea that we shouldn't necessarily be looking to the queen of the ant colony.

1:53:25.520 --> 1:53:32.020
 We should be looking at, I don't know, I don't know, traces of alien life that doesn't look

1:53:32.020 --> 1:53:35.180
 intelligent in any way, may not even look like life.

1:53:35.180 --> 1:53:36.380
 It could be just garbage.

1:53:36.380 --> 1:53:39.660
 We should be looking for garbage.

1:53:39.660 --> 1:53:40.660
 Just generically.

1:53:40.660 --> 1:53:47.420
 Well, garbage that's producible by unnatural forces.

1:53:47.420 --> 1:53:53.160
 For me at least, that was kind of interesting, because if you have a successful alien civilization,

1:53:53.160 --> 1:53:57.180
 that we will be producing many more orders of magnitude of junk, and that would be easier

1:53:57.180 --> 1:53:58.500
 potentially to detect.

1:53:58.500 --> 1:54:02.260
 Well, so you have to produce the junk, but you have to also launch it.

1:54:02.260 --> 1:54:05.620
 So this is the, this is where, I mean, let's, let's imagine.

1:54:05.620 --> 1:54:06.620
 Garbage disposal.

1:54:06.620 --> 1:54:07.620
 Yeah.

1:54:07.620 --> 1:54:13.100
 But let's imagine we are a successful civilization that, you know, has made it to space.

1:54:13.100 --> 1:54:15.420
 We clearly have, right?

1:54:15.420 --> 1:54:20.620
 And yes, we're in the infancy of that pursuit, but, you know, we've launched, I don't know

1:54:20.620 --> 1:54:24.000
 how many satellites.

1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:29.220
 If you count GPS satellites, it must be at least thousands.

1:54:29.220 --> 1:54:30.220
 It's certainly thousands.

1:54:30.220 --> 1:54:32.460
 I don't know if it's over 10,000, but it's on that order.

1:54:32.460 --> 1:54:35.000
 But it's on that, like a large order of magnitude.

1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:39.500
 How many of the things that we've launched will ever leave the solar system?

1:54:39.500 --> 1:54:40.500
 I think two.

1:54:40.500 --> 1:54:41.500
 Two so far.

1:54:41.500 --> 1:54:46.940
 Well, maybe the Voyager, the Voyager 1, Voyager 2, I don't know if the Pioneer.

1:54:46.940 --> 1:54:47.940
 So maybe three.

1:54:47.940 --> 1:54:52.140
 Oh, there's also a Tesla Roadster out there.

1:54:52.140 --> 1:54:54.180
 That one, it will never leave the solar system.

1:54:54.180 --> 1:54:57.420
 It'll just, I think that one will eventually collide with Mars.

1:54:57.420 --> 1:55:02.500
 That can be SpaceX's first Mars destination.

1:55:02.500 --> 1:55:08.460
 But look, so there's an energetic cost to interstellar travel, which is really hard

1:55:08.460 --> 1:55:09.740
 to overcome.

1:55:09.740 --> 1:55:15.500
 And when we think about, you know, generically, what do we look for in an alien civilization,

1:55:15.500 --> 1:55:20.300
 oftentimes we tend to imagine that the thing you look for is the thing that we're doing

1:55:20.300 --> 1:55:21.300
 right now.

1:55:21.300 --> 1:55:22.300
 Yeah.

1:55:22.300 --> 1:55:23.300
 Right?

1:55:23.300 --> 1:55:28.700
 So I think that, you know, if I look at the future, right, and for a while, like, okay,

1:55:28.700 --> 1:55:33.340
 if aliens are out there, they must be broadcasting in radio, right?

1:55:33.340 --> 1:55:41.260
 That radio, you know, the amount that we broadcast in radio has diminished tremendously in the

1:55:41.260 --> 1:55:43.100
 last 50 years.

1:55:43.100 --> 1:55:46.820
 But we're doing a lot more computation, right?

1:55:46.820 --> 1:55:49.380
 What are the signs of computation?

1:55:49.380 --> 1:55:53.540
 Like that's a good, that's an interesting question to ask, right?

1:55:53.540 --> 1:55:58.820
 Where I don't know, I think something on the order of a few percent of the entire electrical

1:55:58.820 --> 1:56:03.620
 grid last year went to mining Bitcoin, right?

1:56:03.620 --> 1:56:04.620
 You know,

1:56:04.620 --> 1:56:09.820
 Yeah, there could be a lot of in the future, different consequences of the computation,

1:56:09.820 --> 1:56:14.780
 which I mean, I'm biased, but it could be robotics, it could be artificial intelligence.

1:56:14.780 --> 1:56:22.580
 So we may be looking for intelligent looking objects, like that's what I meant by probes,

1:56:22.580 --> 1:56:25.460
 like things that move in kind of artificial ways.

1:56:25.460 --> 1:56:29.940
 But the emergence of AI is not an if, right?

1:56:29.940 --> 1:56:33.800
 It's happening right in front of our eyes.

1:56:33.800 --> 1:56:39.860
 And the energetic costs associated with that are becoming, you know, a tangible problem.

1:56:39.860 --> 1:56:45.780
 So I think, you know, if you imagine kind of extrapolating that into the future, right?

1:56:45.780 --> 1:56:50.680
 What are the, you know, what becomes the bottleneck, right?

1:56:50.680 --> 1:56:57.340
 The bottleneck might be powering, you know, powering the AI, broadly speaking, not one

1:56:57.340 --> 1:57:01.180
 AI, but powering that entire AI ecosystem, right?

1:57:01.180 --> 1:57:08.380
 So I don't know, I think, you know, space junk is an is kind of, it's an interesting

1:57:08.380 --> 1:57:14.100
 idea, but it's heavily influenced by like sci fi of 1950s, where by 2020, we're all

1:57:14.100 --> 1:57:17.440
 like, flying to the moon.

1:57:17.440 --> 1:57:23.900
 And so we produce a lot of space junk, I'm not sure if that's the pathway that alien

1:57:23.900 --> 1:57:28.780
 civilizations take, I've also never seen an alien civilization.

1:57:28.780 --> 1:57:29.780
 That's true.

1:57:29.780 --> 1:57:36.140
 But if your theory of chill turns out to be true, and then we don't, you know, we don't

1:57:36.140 --> 1:57:41.740
 necessarily explore, we seize the exploration phase of a, like alien civilizations quickly

1:57:41.740 --> 1:57:49.700
 seize the exploration phase of their, of their efforts, then, then perhaps they'll just be

1:57:49.700 --> 1:57:56.020
 chilling in a particular space, expanding slowly, but then using up a lot of resources

1:57:56.020 --> 1:58:00.660
 and then have to have a lot of garbage disposal that sends stuff out.

1:58:00.660 --> 1:58:06.780
 And the other, you know, the other idea was that it could be a relay that you'll almost

1:58:06.780 --> 1:58:12.220
 have like these GPS like markers, these sent throughout, which I think is kind of interesting.

1:58:12.220 --> 1:58:23.700
 It's similar to this probe idea of sending a large number of probes out to measure gravitational

1:58:23.700 --> 1:58:29.060
 to measure basically, yeah, the gravitational field, essentially, I mean, a lot of people

1:58:29.060 --> 1:58:33.180
 at Caltech or at MIT are trying to measure gravitational fields.

1:58:33.180 --> 1:58:41.100
 And there's, there's a lot of ideas of sending stuff out there that accurately measures those

1:58:41.100 --> 1:58:47.060
 gravitational fields to have a greater understanding of the early universe.

1:58:47.060 --> 1:58:52.300
 But then you might realize that communication through gravitation, through gravity is actually

1:58:52.300 --> 1:58:56.260
 much more effective than, than radio waves, for example, something like that.

1:58:56.260 --> 1:59:03.020
 And then you send out, I mean, okay, if you're an alien civilization that's able to have

1:59:03.020 --> 1:59:09.660
 gigantic masses, like basically, we're getting there as a, as a civilization, no, we're not

1:59:09.660 --> 1:59:10.660
 not even close.

1:59:10.660 --> 1:59:18.460
 Well, I mean, I mean, like be able to sort of play with black holes, that kind of thing.

1:59:18.460 --> 1:59:23.980
 So we're talking about a whole nother order of magnitude of masses, then it may be very

1:59:23.980 --> 1:59:27.020
 effective to send signals via gravitational waves.

1:59:27.020 --> 1:59:33.940
 I actually my sense is that all of these things are genuinely difficult to predict, you know,

1:59:33.940 --> 1:59:38.340
 and I don't mean like, to kind of shy away, I just I really mean, if you think if you

1:59:38.340 --> 1:59:46.900
 take imagination of what the future will look like from, you know, 500 years ago, right?

1:59:46.900 --> 1:59:51.460
 It's just, it is so hard to conceive of the impossible, right?

1:59:51.460 --> 1:59:58.780
 So it's, it's almost like, you know, it's almost limiting to try and imagine things

1:59:58.780 --> 2:00:03.460
 that are an order of magnitude, you know, or two orders of magnitude ahead in terms

2:00:03.460 --> 2:00:10.140
 of progress, just because, you know, you mentioned cars before, you know, if you were to ask

2:00:10.140 --> 2:00:15.380
 people what they wanted in 1870, it's faster buggies, right?

2:00:15.380 --> 2:00:23.700
 So so I think the whole like, kind of, you know, alien conversation inevitably gets gets

2:00:23.700 --> 2:00:31.820
 limited by by our entire kind of collective astrophysical lack of imagination.

2:00:31.820 --> 2:00:38.200
 So to push back a little bit, I find that it's really interesting to talk about these

2:00:38.200 --> 2:00:43.620
 wild ideas about the future, whether it's aliens, whether it's AI, with brilliant people

2:00:43.620 --> 2:00:49.100
 like yourself, who are focused on very particular tools of science, we have today, to solve

2:00:49.100 --> 2:00:52.380
 very particular, like rigorous scientific questions.

2:00:52.380 --> 2:00:56.860
 And it's almost like putting on this wild dreamy hat, like some percent of the time

2:00:56.860 --> 2:01:00.460
 and say, like, what are like, what would alien civilizations look like?

2:01:00.460 --> 2:01:03.260
 What would alien trash look like?

2:01:03.260 --> 2:01:09.620
 Well, what would our own civilization that sends out trillions of AI systems out there,

2:01:09.620 --> 2:01:13.580
 like how 9000, but 10,000 out there, what would that look like?

2:01:13.580 --> 2:01:18.220
 And you're right, any one prediction is probably going to be horrendously wrong.

2:01:18.220 --> 2:01:22.940
 But there's something about creating these kind of wild predictions that kind of opens

2:01:22.940 --> 2:01:23.940
 up.

2:01:23.940 --> 2:01:26.620
 No, there's a huge magnetism to it, right?

2:01:26.620 --> 2:01:35.120
 And some of some of it, you know, I mean, some of the Jules Verne novels did a phenomenal

2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:38.700
 job predicting the future, right?

2:01:38.700 --> 2:01:42.360
 That actually was a great example of what you're talking about, like allowing your imagination

2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:44.500
 to run free.

2:01:44.500 --> 2:01:49.200
 I mean, I just hope, I just hope there's dragons.

2:01:49.200 --> 2:01:54.960
 That's like, I love dragons are the best.

2:01:54.960 --> 2:01:59.380
 But see, the cool thing about science fiction and these kinds of conversations, it doesn't

2:01:59.380 --> 2:02:01.800
 just predict the future, I think.

2:02:01.800 --> 2:02:05.940
 Some of these things will create the future.

2:02:05.940 --> 2:02:12.700
 Taking the idea, the humans are amazing, like fake it till you make it.

2:02:12.700 --> 2:02:18.420
 Humans are really good at taking an idea that seems impossible at the time.

2:02:18.420 --> 2:02:25.300
 And for any one individual human, that idea is like, it's like planting a seed that eventually

2:02:25.300 --> 2:02:26.300
 materializes itself.

2:02:26.300 --> 2:02:27.300
 It's weird.

2:02:27.300 --> 2:02:32.500
 It's weird how science fiction can create science fiction, it drives the science.

2:02:32.500 --> 2:02:43.460
 I agree with you, and I think in this regard, you know, I'm like a sucker for sci fi.

2:02:43.460 --> 2:02:50.340
 It's all I listen to like now when I run and some of it is completely implausible, right?

2:02:50.340 --> 2:02:54.620
 And it's just like, I don't care.

2:02:54.620 --> 2:03:01.380
 It's both entertaining and, you know, it's just like, it's imagination.

2:03:01.380 --> 2:03:05.580
 You know about the black clouds book, I think this is by Fred Hoyle.

2:03:05.580 --> 2:03:09.380
 This is like, this has great connections with sort of a lot of the advancements that are

2:03:09.380 --> 2:03:16.060
 happening in NLP right now, right, with transformer models and so on.

2:03:16.060 --> 2:03:21.380
 But you know, it's this black cloud shows up in the solar system and then, you know,

2:03:21.380 --> 2:03:26.140
 people try to send radio and then it learns to talk back at you, you know.

2:03:26.140 --> 2:03:30.700
 So anyway, we don't have to talk at all about it, but it's just, it's something worth checking

2:03:30.700 --> 2:03:31.700
 out.

2:03:31.700 --> 2:03:36.700
 With that, on the alien front, with the black cloud, to me, exactly, on the NLP front, and

2:03:36.700 --> 2:03:39.980
 also just explainability of AI, it's fascinating.

2:03:39.980 --> 2:03:44.660
 Just the very question, Stephen Wolfram looked at this with the movie Arrival, it's like,

2:03:44.660 --> 2:03:47.940
 what would be the common language that we would discover?

2:03:47.940 --> 2:03:51.740
 The reason that's really interesting to me is we have aliens here on earth now.

2:03:51.740 --> 2:03:52.740
 Japanese.

2:03:52.740 --> 2:03:53.740
 Japanese, oh yeah.

2:03:53.740 --> 2:03:54.740
 Japanese is the obvious answer.

2:03:54.740 --> 2:03:59.900
 Japanese, yeah, that would be the common, maybe it would be music, actually.

2:03:59.900 --> 2:04:00.900
 That's more likely.

2:04:00.900 --> 2:04:01.900
 It wouldn't be a language.

2:04:01.900 --> 2:04:04.020
 It would be art that they would communicate.

2:04:04.020 --> 2:04:09.900
 But you know, I do believe that we have, I'm with Stephen Wolfram on this a little bit,

2:04:09.900 --> 2:04:16.540
 that to me, computation, like programs we write, that, you know, that they're kind of

2:04:16.540 --> 2:04:21.300
 intelligent creatures and I feel like we haven't found the common language to talk with them.

2:04:21.300 --> 2:04:28.820
 Like our little creations that are artificial are not born with whatever that innate thing

2:04:28.820 --> 2:04:34.900
 that produces language with us and like, coming up with mechanisms for communicating with

2:04:34.900 --> 2:04:42.540
 them is an effort that feels like it will produce some incredible discoveries.

2:04:42.540 --> 2:04:47.820
 You can even think of, if you think that math has discovered, mathematics in itself is a

2:04:47.820 --> 2:04:48.820
 kind of...

2:04:48.820 --> 2:04:54.060
 Oh yeah, it's an innate construction of the world we live in.

2:04:54.060 --> 2:05:05.620
 I think we are, you know, part of the way there because pre 1950, right, computers were

2:05:05.620 --> 2:05:09.300
 human beings that would carry out arithmetic, right?

2:05:09.300 --> 2:05:17.340
 And I think it was Ulam who worked in Los Alamos at the time, like towards the end of

2:05:17.340 --> 2:05:23.200
 the second world war, wrote something about how, you know, in the future, right, computers

2:05:23.200 --> 2:05:31.240
 will not be just arithmetic tool, but will be truly an interactive, you know, thing with

2:05:31.240 --> 2:05:34.380
 which you could do experiments, right?

2:05:34.380 --> 2:05:40.340
 At the time, the notion of doing an experiment, not like in the lab with some beakers, but

2:05:40.340 --> 2:05:47.660
 an experiment on a computer, designing an experiment, a numerical experiment was a new

2:05:47.660 --> 2:05:48.660
 one.

2:05:48.660 --> 2:05:55.580
 Like, you know, 70% of what I do is I design, you know, I write code, terrible code to be

2:05:55.580 --> 2:06:04.340
 clear, like, but, you know, I write code that creates an experiment, which is a simulation.

2:06:04.340 --> 2:06:08.860
 So in that sense, I think we're beginning to interact with the computer in a way that

2:06:08.860 --> 2:06:14.820
 you're saying, not as just a, you know, fancy calculator, not as just a, you know, call

2:06:14.820 --> 2:06:23.740
 and request type of thing, but, you know, something that can generate insights that

2:06:23.740 --> 2:06:29.340
 are otherwise completely unattainable, right there, unattainable by doing analytical mathematics.

2:06:29.340 --> 2:06:30.340
 Yeah.

2:06:30.340 --> 2:06:38.100
 And there's, with AlphaFold 2, we're now starting to crack open biology, so being able to simulate

2:06:38.100 --> 2:06:43.240
 at first trivial biological systems and hopefully down the line, complex biological systems.

2:06:43.240 --> 2:06:49.380
 My hope is to be able to simulate psychological, like sociological systems, like humans.

2:06:49.380 --> 2:06:57.180
 I've, you know, a large part of my work at MIT was on autonomous vehicles, and the fascinating

2:06:57.180 --> 2:07:03.220
 thing to me was about pedestrians, human pedestrians interacting with autonomous vehicles and simulating

2:07:03.220 --> 2:07:07.980
 those systems without murdering humans would be very useful, but nevertheless is exceptionally

2:07:07.980 --> 2:07:08.980
 difficult.

2:07:08.980 --> 2:07:09.980
 Yeah, I would say so.

2:07:09.980 --> 2:07:11.980
 When is my Mustang gonna drive itself?

2:07:11.980 --> 2:07:12.980
 Right.

2:07:12.980 --> 2:07:16.700
 I'm not even joking, it's like, yeah.

2:07:16.700 --> 2:07:23.300
 It turns out it's much more difficult than we imagined, and I suppose that's the kind

2:07:23.300 --> 2:07:32.720
 of, the progress of science is just like, you know, going to Mars, it's probably going

2:07:32.720 --> 2:07:35.500
 to turn out to be way more difficult than we imagined.

2:07:35.500 --> 2:07:39.820
 Sending out probes to investigate Planet 9 at the edge of our solar system might turn

2:07:39.820 --> 2:07:43.700
 out to be way more difficult than we imagined, but we do it anyway, and we figure it out

2:07:43.700 --> 2:07:44.700
 in the end.

2:07:44.700 --> 2:07:49.660
 It's actually, Mars is a great, I mean, going, sending humans to Mars is way more complicated

2:07:49.660 --> 2:07:51.580
 than sending humans to the moon.

2:07:51.580 --> 2:07:57.380
 You'd think, just like naively, both are in space, who cares, like, if you go there, why

2:07:57.380 --> 2:08:05.500
 don't you go there, you know, just life support is an extremely expensive thing, yeah.

2:08:05.500 --> 2:08:09.100
 There's a bunch of extra challenges, but I disagree with you, I would be one of the early

2:08:09.100 --> 2:08:10.100
 people to go.

2:08:10.100 --> 2:08:14.180
 I used to think not, I used to think I'd be one of the first maybe million to go once

2:08:14.180 --> 2:08:18.820
 you have a little bit of a society, I think I'm upgrading myself to the first like 10,000.

2:08:18.820 --> 2:08:22.000
 Yeah, that's right, front of the cabin.

2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:30.020
 Not completely front, but like, it would be interesting to die, I'm okay with, death sucks,

2:08:30.020 --> 2:08:34.160
 but I kind of like the idea of dying on Mars.

2:08:34.160 --> 2:08:39.580
 Of all the places to die, I gotta say, in this regard, like, I don't wanna die on Mars.

2:08:39.580 --> 2:08:40.580
 You don't?

2:08:40.580 --> 2:08:45.220
 No, no, I would much rather die on Earth.

2:08:45.220 --> 2:08:50.940
 I mean, death is fundamentally boring, right, like, death is a very boring experience, but

2:08:50.940 --> 2:08:54.180
 I mean, I've never died before, so I don't know from first hand experience.

2:08:54.180 --> 2:08:55.180
 As far as you know.

2:08:55.180 --> 2:08:56.180
 Yeah.

2:08:56.180 --> 2:08:57.780
 It could be reincarnation, all those kinds of things.

2:08:57.780 --> 2:09:01.700
 So you mean, where would you die?

2:09:01.700 --> 2:09:04.700
 If you had to choose?

2:09:04.700 --> 2:09:13.420
 Oh, man, okay, so I would definitely, there's a question of who I'd wanna die with, I prefer

2:09:13.420 --> 2:09:22.660
 not to die alone, but like, surrounded by family would be preferable, where I think

2:09:22.660 --> 2:09:27.500
 Northern New Mexico, and I'm not even joking, like, this is not a random place, it's just

2:09:27.500 --> 2:09:28.500
 like.

2:09:28.500 --> 2:09:31.620
 Would that be your favorite place on Earth?

2:09:31.620 --> 2:09:38.700
 Not necessarily, like, favorite place on Earth to reside, you know, indefinitely, but it

2:09:38.700 --> 2:09:43.460
 is one of the most beautiful places I've ever been to.

2:09:43.460 --> 2:09:49.540
 So you know, there's something, I don't know, there's something attractive about going,

2:09:49.540 --> 2:09:50.540
 you know.

2:09:50.540 --> 2:09:54.760
 Returning to nature in a beautiful place.

2:09:54.760 --> 2:09:59.660
 Let me ask you about another aspect of your life that is full of beauty, music.

2:09:59.660 --> 2:10:00.660
 Okay.

2:10:00.660 --> 2:10:02.900
 You're a musician.

2:10:02.900 --> 2:10:08.660
 The absurd question I have to ask, what is the greatest song of all time, objectively

2:10:08.660 --> 2:10:09.660
 speaking?

2:10:09.660 --> 2:10:10.820
 The greatest song of all time.

2:10:10.820 --> 2:10:16.000
 I suppose that could change moment to moment, day to day, but if you were forced to answer

2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:20.820
 for this particular moment in your life, that's something that pops to mind, this could be

2:10:20.820 --> 2:10:25.060
 both philosophically, this could be technically as a musician, like what you enjoy, maybe

2:10:25.060 --> 2:10:26.060
 lyrics.

2:10:26.060 --> 2:10:32.580
 Lyrics is very important, so I would probably, it would be, my choice would be lyrics based.

2:10:32.580 --> 2:10:37.380
 I don't want to answer in terms of just technical, you know, technical prowess.

2:10:37.380 --> 2:10:41.540
 I think technical prowess is impressive, right?

2:10:41.540 --> 2:10:44.940
 It's just like, it's impressive what can be done.

2:10:44.940 --> 2:10:49.420
 I wouldn't place that into the category of the greatest music ever written.

2:10:49.420 --> 2:10:57.420
 Some classical music that's written is undeniably beautiful, but I don't want to consider that

2:10:57.420 --> 2:11:06.700
 category of music either, just because, you know, so if I have to limit the scope of this

2:11:06.700 --> 2:11:13.240
 philosophical discussion to, you know, the kind of music that I listen to, you know,

2:11:13.240 --> 2:11:18.660
 probably What's My Age Again by Blink 182, it's just, you know, it's a solid one.

2:11:18.660 --> 2:11:21.740
 It's got, you know.

2:11:21.740 --> 2:11:22.740
 Said nobody ever.

2:11:22.740 --> 2:11:23.740
 That's a good song.

2:11:23.740 --> 2:11:24.740
 I don't know if you're joking.

2:11:24.740 --> 2:11:25.740
 No, no.

2:11:25.740 --> 2:11:26.740
 I am joking.

2:11:26.740 --> 2:11:29.740
 It's a good one, but it's, yeah, I mean.

2:11:29.740 --> 2:11:32.860
 I was going to come back as a close second.

2:11:32.860 --> 2:11:37.180
 What's My Age Again, oh, yeah.

2:11:37.180 --> 2:11:44.780
 No, I mean, it would probably, you know, songwriting wise, I think The Beatles came pretty close

2:11:44.780 --> 2:11:45.780
 to.

2:11:45.780 --> 2:11:46.780
 Were they influential to you?

2:11:46.780 --> 2:11:47.780
 Absolutely.

2:11:47.780 --> 2:11:48.780
 Yeah.

2:11:48.780 --> 2:11:49.780
 Yeah.

2:11:49.780 --> 2:11:50.780
 Love The Beatles.

2:11:50.780 --> 2:11:51.780
 I love The Beatles.

2:11:51.780 --> 2:11:52.780
 Let it be yesterday.

2:11:52.780 --> 2:11:53.780
 Yeah.

2:11:53.780 --> 2:11:57.300
 Like, I think Strawberry Fields Forever is one.

2:11:57.300 --> 2:12:00.260
 You know what one of my favorite Beatles songs is?

2:12:00.260 --> 2:12:04.220
 It's, you know, In My Life, right?

2:12:04.220 --> 2:12:09.300
 It's hard to imagine how, whatever, a 24 year old wrote that.

2:12:09.300 --> 2:12:14.340
 It is one of the most introspective pieces of music ever.

2:12:14.340 --> 2:12:20.740
 You know, I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan, and so I think, you know, if you were to, you can

2:12:20.740 --> 2:12:27.380
 sort of look at the entire Dark Side of the Moon album as, you know, getting pretty close

2:12:27.380 --> 2:12:32.660
 up there to the pinnacle of what, you know, can be created, so, you know, Time is a great

2:12:32.660 --> 2:12:33.660
 song.

2:12:33.660 --> 2:12:34.660
 Yeah.

2:12:34.660 --> 2:12:35.660
 It's a great song.

2:12:35.660 --> 2:12:42.380
 Just the entirety of just the instruments, the lyrics, the feeling created by a song,

2:12:42.380 --> 2:12:46.860
 like Pink Floyd can create feelings.

2:12:46.860 --> 2:12:52.420
 The entire experience, I mean, you have that with The Wall of just transporting you into

2:12:52.420 --> 2:12:54.060
 another place.

2:12:54.060 --> 2:12:58.220
 Songs don't, not many songs could do that as well.

2:12:58.220 --> 2:13:00.660
 Not many artists can do that as well as Pink Floyd did.

2:13:00.660 --> 2:13:06.580
 There are a lot of bands that you can kind of say, oh yeah, like if you take Blink 182,

2:13:06.580 --> 2:13:07.580
 right?

2:13:07.580 --> 2:13:13.740
 You have no idea, like if you are listening to sort of that type of pop punk for the first

2:13:13.740 --> 2:13:20.100
 time, it's difficult to differentiate between Blink 182 and like Sum 41 and the thousand

2:13:20.100 --> 2:13:25.780
 of other like lesser known bands that all sounded, they all had that sparkling production

2:13:25.780 --> 2:13:32.020
 feel, they all kind of sounded the same, right?

2:13:32.020 --> 2:13:38.180
 With Pink Floyd, it's hard to find another band that you're like, well, is this one Pink

2:13:38.180 --> 2:13:39.180
 Floyd?

2:13:39.180 --> 2:13:43.420
 Like you know when you're listening to Pink Floyd what you're listening to.

2:13:43.420 --> 2:13:45.520
 The uniqueness, that's fascinating.

2:13:45.520 --> 2:13:51.540
 You know, in the calculation of the greatest song in the greatest band of all time, you

2:13:51.540 --> 2:13:56.580
 could probably, you could probably actually quantify this like scientifically, is like

2:13:56.580 --> 2:14:01.900
 how unique, if you play different songs, how well are people able to recognize whether

2:14:01.900 --> 2:14:03.660
 it's this band or not?

2:14:03.660 --> 2:14:07.300
 And that, you know, that's probably a huge component to greatness.

2:14:07.300 --> 2:14:10.620
 Like if the world would miss it if it was gone.

2:14:10.620 --> 2:14:11.620
 Yes.

2:14:11.620 --> 2:14:12.620
 Yes.

2:14:12.620 --> 2:14:13.620
 So.

2:14:13.620 --> 2:14:17.420
 But there's also the human story things, like I would say I would put Johnny Cash's cover

2:14:17.420 --> 2:14:22.140
 of Hurt as one of the greatest songs of all time.

2:14:22.140 --> 2:14:24.740
 And that has less to do with the song.

2:14:24.740 --> 2:14:26.780
 But your interaction with it.

2:14:26.780 --> 2:14:29.840
 Interaction with it, but also the human, the full story of the human.

2:14:29.840 --> 2:14:34.500
 You're like, it's not just, if I just heard the song, I'd be like, okay.

2:14:34.500 --> 2:14:40.360
 But if it's the full story of it, also the video component for that particular song.

2:14:40.360 --> 2:14:43.980
 So like that, you can't discount the full experience of it.

2:14:43.980 --> 2:14:44.980
 Absolutely.

2:14:44.980 --> 2:14:52.900
 You know, I have no confusion about not, about being, you know, anywhere, you know, in that

2:14:52.900 --> 2:15:01.180
 league, but I just like sometimes think about, you know, music that is being produced today

2:15:01.180 --> 2:15:08.900
 feels oftentimes, it feels like kind of clothes, like clothes that you buy at like H&M and

2:15:08.900 --> 2:15:12.980
 you wear it three times before they rip and you throw away.

2:15:12.980 --> 2:15:18.760
 So like so much of it is, it's not bad, it's just kind of forgettable, right?

2:15:18.760 --> 2:15:24.980
 Like the fact that we're talking about Pink Floyd in 2021 is in itself an interesting

2:15:24.980 --> 2:15:26.500
 question.

2:15:26.500 --> 2:15:28.300
 Why are we talking about Pink Floyd?

2:15:28.300 --> 2:15:33.180
 And there's something unforgettable about them and unforgettable about the art that

2:15:33.180 --> 2:15:34.420
 they created.

2:15:34.420 --> 2:15:41.220
 That could be the markets that like, so Spotify has created this kind of market where the

2:15:41.220 --> 2:15:46.460
 incentives for creating music that lasts is much lower because there's so much more music.

2:15:46.460 --> 2:15:50.820
 You just want something that shines bright for a short amount of time, makes a lot of

2:15:50.820 --> 2:15:51.820
 money and moves on.

2:15:51.820 --> 2:15:54.980
 And I mean, the same thing you see with the news and all those kinds of things, we're

2:15:54.980 --> 2:16:00.700
 just living in a shorter and shorter, shorter like a time scale in terms of our attention

2:16:00.700 --> 2:16:01.860
 spans.

2:16:01.860 --> 2:16:07.100
 And that, nevertheless, when we look at the long arc of history of music, perhaps there

2:16:07.100 --> 2:16:12.580
 will be some songs from today that will last as much as Pink Floyd, we're just unable to

2:16:12.580 --> 2:16:13.580
 see it.

2:16:13.580 --> 2:16:14.580
 Yeah.

2:16:14.580 --> 2:16:15.580
 Just the collected works of Nickelback.

2:16:15.580 --> 2:16:16.580
 Exactly.

2:16:16.580 --> 2:16:17.580
 You never know.

2:16:17.580 --> 2:16:18.580
 You never know.

2:16:18.580 --> 2:16:19.580
 Justin Bieber.

2:16:19.580 --> 2:16:20.580
 It could be a contender.

2:16:20.580 --> 2:16:24.140
 I've recently started listening to Justin Bieber just to understand what people are

2:16:24.140 --> 2:16:25.140
 talking about.

2:16:25.140 --> 2:16:28.140
 And I'll just keep my comments to myself on that one.

2:16:28.140 --> 2:16:29.940
 It's too good to explain in words.

2:16:29.940 --> 2:16:35.780
 The words cannot capture the greatness that is the Biebs.

2:16:35.780 --> 2:16:44.180
 You as a musician, so you write your own music, you play guitar, you sing.

2:16:44.180 --> 2:16:49.100
 Maybe can you give an overview of the role music has played in your life?

2:16:49.100 --> 2:16:52.680
 You're one of the, you're a world class scientist.

2:16:52.680 --> 2:17:01.500
 And so it's kind of fascinating to see somebody in your position who is also a great musician

2:17:01.500 --> 2:17:04.500
 and still loves playing music.

2:17:04.500 --> 2:17:05.500
 Yeah.

2:17:05.500 --> 2:17:06.500
 Well, I wouldn't call myself a great musician.

2:17:06.500 --> 2:17:07.500
 I'm like, you know.

2:17:07.500 --> 2:17:08.500
 One of the best of all time.

2:17:08.500 --> 2:17:09.500
 Yeah.

2:17:09.500 --> 2:17:10.500
 That's right.

2:17:10.500 --> 2:17:15.940
 Like we were saying offline, confidence is like the most essential thing about being

2:17:15.940 --> 2:17:16.940
 a rock star.

2:17:16.940 --> 2:17:17.940
 That's right.

2:17:17.940 --> 2:17:18.940
 Exactly.

2:17:18.940 --> 2:17:20.620
 It's the confidence and kind of like moodiness, right?

2:17:20.620 --> 2:17:21.620
 Yeah.

2:17:21.620 --> 2:17:22.620
 Yeah.

2:17:22.620 --> 2:17:31.180
 Look, I mean, music plays an absolutely essential role in everything I do because I lose, if

2:17:31.180 --> 2:17:38.220
 I stop playing for one reason or another, say I'm traveling, I notably lose creativity

2:17:38.220 --> 2:17:41.140
 in every other aspect of my life, right?

2:17:41.140 --> 2:17:48.540
 There's something, I don't view, you know, playing music as a separate endeavor from

2:17:48.540 --> 2:17:50.460
 doing science or doing whatever.

2:17:50.460 --> 2:18:01.240
 It's all part of that same creative thing, which is distinct from, I don't know, pressing

2:18:01.240 --> 2:18:02.660
 a button or like, you know.

2:18:02.660 --> 2:18:06.020
 So it's not a break from science, it's a part of your science.

2:18:06.020 --> 2:18:12.860
 Absolutely, it's a part of, I would say, you know, it's a thing that enables the science,

2:18:12.860 --> 2:18:13.860
 right?

2:18:13.860 --> 2:18:19.380
 The science would, you know, suck even more than it does already without the music.

2:18:19.380 --> 2:18:23.300
 And that means like the creating of the writing of the music or is it just even playing other

2:18:23.300 --> 2:18:24.300
 people's stuff?

2:18:24.300 --> 2:18:26.340
 Is it the whole of it?

2:18:26.340 --> 2:18:27.340
 Yeah.

2:18:27.340 --> 2:18:28.340
 It's definitely both.

2:18:28.340 --> 2:18:29.340
 Yeah.

2:18:29.340 --> 2:18:36.940
 And also just, you know, I love to play guitar, I love to sing, you know.

2:18:36.940 --> 2:18:44.220
 My wife tolerates my screeching singing, you know, and even kind of likes it.

2:18:44.220 --> 2:18:46.820
 Yeah, so people should check out your stuff.

2:18:46.820 --> 2:18:49.960
 You have a great voice, so I love your stuff.

2:18:49.960 --> 2:18:57.920
 Is there something, you're super busy, is there something you can say about practicing

2:18:57.920 --> 2:19:03.680
 for musicians, for guitar, you're also in a band, so like that whole, how you can manage

2:19:03.680 --> 2:19:04.680
 that?

2:19:04.680 --> 2:19:09.980
 Is there some tricks, is there some hacks to being a lifelong musician while being like

2:19:09.980 --> 2:19:11.140
 super busy?

2:19:11.140 --> 2:19:19.980
 So I would say, you know, the way that I optimize my life is I try to do, you know, the thing

2:19:19.980 --> 2:19:26.140
 that I'm passionate about in a moment and put that at the top of the priority list.

2:19:26.140 --> 2:19:30.740
 There are moments when, you know, you just, you feel inspired to play music and if you're

2:19:30.740 --> 2:19:35.340
 in the middle of something, if you can avoid, if that can be put on hold, just do it, right?

2:19:35.340 --> 2:19:43.020
 There are times when you get inspired about something scientific, you know, I do my best

2:19:43.020 --> 2:19:51.260
 to drop everything, go into that, you know, mode of, that isolated mode and execute upon

2:19:51.260 --> 2:19:52.260
 that.

2:19:52.260 --> 2:19:57.000
 It's a chaotic, you know, I think I have a pretty chaotic lifestyle where I'm always

2:19:57.000 --> 2:20:03.580
 doing kind of multiple things and jumping between what I'm doing.

2:20:03.580 --> 2:20:13.020
 But at the end of the day, it's not like, you know, those moments of inspiration are

2:20:13.020 --> 2:20:14.780
 actually kind of rare, right?

2:20:14.780 --> 2:20:21.740
 Like most of the time, all of us are just doing kind of, doing the stuff that needs

2:20:21.740 --> 2:20:23.040
 to get done.

2:20:23.040 --> 2:20:29.740
 If you do the disservice to yourself of saying, oh, I'm inspired to, you know, do this calculation,

2:20:29.740 --> 2:20:37.580
 figure this out, but I've got to answer email or just like do something silly, you know,

2:20:37.580 --> 2:20:40.940
 that is nothing more than disservice.

2:20:40.940 --> 2:20:48.500
 And also, like I have some social media presence, but I mostly stay off of, you know, social

2:20:48.500 --> 2:20:55.460
 media to, you know, just frankly, cause like, I don't kind of, I don't enjoy the mental

2:20:55.460 --> 2:20:57.500
 cycles that it, that it takes over.

2:20:57.500 --> 2:21:03.940
 Yeah, it robs you of that, the, yeah, those precious moments that could be filled with

2:21:03.940 --> 2:21:08.220
 inspiration in your, in your other pursuits.

2:21:08.220 --> 2:21:12.160
 But there's something to, maybe you and I are different in this, like I tried to play

2:21:12.160 --> 2:21:20.420
 at least 10 minutes of guitar every day, like almost on the technical side, like keeping

2:21:20.420 --> 2:21:27.420
 that base of basic competence going.

2:21:27.420 --> 2:21:31.500
 And I mean, the same way like writers will get in front of a paper no matter what, that

2:21:31.500 --> 2:21:38.980
 kind of thing, it just feels like that for my life has been essential to the daily ritual

2:21:38.980 --> 2:21:39.980
 of it.

2:21:39.980 --> 2:21:44.220
 Why does days turn into weeks, weeks turn into months, and you haven't played guitar

2:21:44.220 --> 2:21:45.220
 for months?

2:21:45.220 --> 2:21:47.500
 No, no, I, I, I understand.

2:21:47.500 --> 2:21:53.180
 For me, I think it's, it's been like, if we have a gig coming up, we'll definitely

2:21:53.180 --> 2:21:54.180
 You need deadlines.

2:21:54.180 --> 2:21:55.180
 Yeah, yeah, that's right.

2:21:55.180 --> 2:22:03.060
 No, like we, we will, we will sharpen up definitely, you know, especially coming up to a gig.

2:22:03.060 --> 2:22:06.660
 It's like, you know, we're not trying to make money with this.

2:22:06.660 --> 2:22:13.540
 This is like, just for the, for that satisfaction of doing something and doing something well,

2:22:13.540 --> 2:22:15.300
 right?

2:22:15.300 --> 2:22:22.900
 But overall, I would say most, I play guitar most days, most days.

2:22:22.900 --> 2:22:29.980
 And you know, when I put kids to sleep, I play guitar, you know, with them and we like,

2:22:29.980 --> 2:22:35.460
 just make up random songs about, you know, about our cat or something, you know, like

2:22:35.460 --> 2:22:39.060
 we just do kind of random stuff.

2:22:39.060 --> 2:22:41.780
 But you know, music is always involved in that process.

2:22:41.780 --> 2:22:43.340
 Yeah, keeping it fun.

2:22:43.340 --> 2:22:44.460
 You have Russian roots?

2:22:44.460 --> 2:22:45.460
 I sure do.

2:22:45.460 --> 2:22:46.460
 Were you born in Russia?

2:22:46.460 --> 2:22:47.460
 I was.

2:22:47.460 --> 2:22:48.460
 Yeah.

2:22:48.460 --> 2:22:49.460
 When did you come here?

2:22:49.460 --> 2:22:55.300
 So, I came to the US in very, the very end of 99.

2:22:55.300 --> 2:22:59.880
 But so I was like, almost 14 years old.

2:22:59.880 --> 2:23:03.360
 But along the way, we spent six years in Japan.

2:23:03.360 --> 2:23:10.620
 So like, we moved from Russia to Japan in 94, and then to the US in 99.

2:23:10.620 --> 2:23:14.220
 So did like elementary school, middle school in Japan.

2:23:14.220 --> 2:23:16.620
 So elementary school in Japan.

2:23:16.620 --> 2:23:17.620
 Yeah.

2:23:17.620 --> 2:23:19.220
 So, that's interesting, dad.

2:23:19.220 --> 2:23:20.220
 Do you still speak Russian?

2:23:20.220 --> 2:23:21.220
 Sure.

2:23:21.220 --> 2:23:22.220
 Okay.

2:23:22.220 --> 2:23:23.220
 Ты по русски говоришь?

2:23:23.220 --> 2:23:24.220
 Да, конечно.

2:23:24.220 --> 2:23:31.660
 Okay, maybe I'll, let me ask you, in Russian, что ты помнишь о России?

2:23:31.660 --> 2:23:33.660
 It'd be interesting to hear you speak Russian.

2:23:33.660 --> 2:23:38.100
 В общем, в целом, я помню, то есть мне было восемь, когда

2:23:38.100 --> 2:23:47.140
 мы уехали, и, конечно, как сказать, помню в первом

2:23:47.140 --> 2:23:52.700
 приближении всё, включая вот переход, там, 91, 92 год,

2:23:52.700 --> 2:23:56.700
 вот этот вот, вот этот турбулентный период, и ещё, естественно,

2:23:56.700 --> 2:23:57.700
 93.

2:23:57.700 --> 2:24:03.700
 То есть ещё я очень хорошо помню, как в какой то момент

2:24:03.700 --> 2:24:07.900
 сначала появилась пепси кола, а потом появилась

2:24:07.900 --> 2:24:08.900
 кока кола.

2:24:08.900 --> 2:24:13.500
 Я потом, я помню, я был лет, не знаю, в шесть, и я потом,

2:24:13.500 --> 2:24:17.420
 как так может быть, что кока кола украла продукт и

2:24:17.420 --> 2:24:18.740
 сделала то же самое?

2:24:18.740 --> 2:24:26.060
 То есть я никогда, я долго думал, что и пепси, и кока

2:24:26.060 --> 2:24:30.020
 колу изобрели, типа, в 92 году.

2:24:30.020 --> 2:24:33.360
 So for people who don't speak Russian, Konstantin was talking

2:24:33.360 --> 2:24:39.220
 about basically his first, in 1992, interaction with capitalism,

2:24:39.220 --> 2:24:43.020
 which is Pepsi, and at first he discovered Pepsi, and then he

2:24:43.020 --> 2:24:47.780
 discovered Coke, and he was confused how such, how such

2:24:47.780 --> 2:24:48.780
 theft could occur.

2:24:48.780 --> 2:24:50.340
 Yeah, like an intellectual property theft.

2:24:50.340 --> 2:24:55.180
 And remember, Pepsi arrived to the Soviet Union first,

2:24:55.180 --> 2:24:58.300
 and there was some, there's some complicated story which I

2:24:58.300 --> 2:25:00.980
 don't quite understand the details of.

2:25:00.980 --> 2:25:05.620
 For a while, Pepsi like commanded submarines or

2:25:05.620 --> 2:25:06.620
 something.

2:25:06.620 --> 2:25:09.700
 Yeah, Pepsi had like a fleet of Soviet submarines that it

2:25:09.700 --> 2:25:10.700
 was.

2:25:10.700 --> 2:25:13.860
 They were sponsoring tanks and this fascinating.

2:25:13.860 --> 2:25:16.700
 And I remember, there's certain things that trickled in, like

2:25:16.700 --> 2:25:18.500
 McDonald's, I remember that was a big deal.

2:25:18.500 --> 2:25:19.500
 Oh yeah.

2:25:19.500 --> 2:25:20.500
 Certain aspects of the West.

2:25:20.500 --> 2:25:21.500
 Absolutely.

2:25:21.500 --> 2:25:25.300
 So, I mean, we went to McDonald's, and we stood on, I mean,

2:25:25.300 --> 2:25:29.140
 this is, this is absurd, right, from, kind of looking at it

2:25:29.140 --> 2:25:33.700
 from today's perspective, but we stood in line for like six

2:25:33.700 --> 2:25:38.140
 hours to get into this McDonald's, and I remember inside

2:25:38.140 --> 2:25:42.420
 it was just like a billion people, and I'm just taking a

2:25:42.420 --> 2:25:47.080
 bite out of that Big Mac, and we're like, wow.

2:25:47.080 --> 2:25:49.540
 What was it, an incredible experience for you?

2:25:49.540 --> 2:25:52.580
 So, like, what is this taste of the West like?

2:25:52.580 --> 2:25:53.580
 Did you enjoy it?

2:25:53.580 --> 2:25:58.060
 I enjoyed the fact that, I mean, this is like, this is getting

2:25:58.060 --> 2:26:01.740
 into the weeds, but I really enjoyed the fact that the top of

2:26:01.740 --> 2:26:06.060
 the bun had those seeds, you know, like, and I remember how

2:26:06.060 --> 2:26:08.780
 on the commercials, like, the Big Mac would kind of bounce.

2:26:08.780 --> 2:26:12.140
 I was like, the seeds, how do they inject the seeds into the

2:26:12.140 --> 2:26:13.140
 bread?

2:26:13.140 --> 2:26:14.140
 Like, amazing.

2:26:14.140 --> 2:26:15.140
 Yeah.

2:26:15.140 --> 2:26:16.140
 Right.

2:26:16.140 --> 2:26:17.140
 So, I think it was...

2:26:17.140 --> 2:26:18.140
 Artistry.

2:26:18.140 --> 2:26:19.140
 Yeah.

2:26:19.140 --> 2:26:21.460
 But you enjoyed the artistry of the culinary experience.

2:26:21.460 --> 2:26:22.460
 Exactly.

2:26:22.460 --> 2:26:25.940
 It was the, you know, it was the food art that is the Big Mac.

2:26:25.940 --> 2:26:27.620
 Actually, I still don't know the answer to that.

2:26:27.620 --> 2:26:28.980
 How do they get the sesame seeds on the bun?

2:26:28.980 --> 2:26:31.580
 It's better to not know the answer.

2:26:31.580 --> 2:26:33.420
 You just wander the mystery of it all.

2:26:33.420 --> 2:26:39.340
 Yeah, I remember it being exceptionally delicious, but I'm with you, I don't know, you didn't

2:26:39.340 --> 2:26:45.180
 mention how transformative Pepsi was, but to me, basically sugar based stuff, like Pepsi

2:26:45.180 --> 2:26:51.060
 was, or Coke, I don't remember which one we partook in, but that was an incredible experience.

2:26:51.060 --> 2:26:53.380
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, absolutely.

2:26:53.380 --> 2:27:04.020
 And, you know, I think it's, you know, it was an important and formative period.

2:27:04.020 --> 2:27:10.540
 I sometimes, I guess, rely on that a little bit, you know, in my daily life, because I

2:27:10.540 --> 2:27:18.900
 remember, like, the early 90s were real rough, you know, like my parents were kind of on

2:27:18.900 --> 2:27:26.540
 the bottom of the spectrum in terms of, you know, in terms of financial well being.

2:27:26.540 --> 2:27:35.480
 So kind of like just when I run into trouble, not like, you know, money trouble, just any

2:27:35.480 --> 2:27:42.220
 kind of trouble these days, it just kind of is not particularly meaningful when you compare

2:27:42.220 --> 2:27:45.260
 it to that turbulent time of the early 90s.

2:27:45.260 --> 2:27:52.460
 And the other thing is, I think there's like an advantage to being, you know, an immigrant,

2:27:52.460 --> 2:27:59.900
 which is that you go through the mental exercise of changing your environment completely early

2:27:59.900 --> 2:28:00.900
 in your life, right?

2:28:00.900 --> 2:28:07.500
 You go, it's by no means, you know, pleasant in the moment, right, but like going into

2:28:07.500 --> 2:28:13.860
 Japanese elementary school, right, like, I didn't go to some, like, private, you know,

2:28:13.860 --> 2:28:19.860
 thing, I just went to a regular, like, Japanese public elementary school, and I was the non

2:28:19.860 --> 2:28:22.900
 Japanese person in my class.

2:28:22.900 --> 2:28:26.420
 So just like to learn Japanese and just kind of.

2:28:26.420 --> 2:28:30.860
 So that's a super humbling experience in many ways was when you like made fun of all that

2:28:30.860 --> 2:28:31.860
 kind of stuff.

2:28:31.860 --> 2:28:32.860
 Oh, yeah.

2:28:32.860 --> 2:28:33.860
 Being the outsider.

2:28:33.860 --> 2:28:34.860
 Oh, absolutely.

2:28:34.860 --> 2:28:41.420
 But, you know, you kind of do, you kind of do that, and then you kind of, then you just

2:28:41.420 --> 2:28:44.580
 kind of are okay with stuff, you know what I mean?

2:28:44.580 --> 2:28:50.980
 And so like doing that, again, in middle school in the US, it was arguably easy, because I

2:28:50.980 --> 2:28:53.220
 was like, yeah, well, I've already done this before.

2:28:53.220 --> 2:28:59.340
 So I think it kind of prepares you mentally a little bit for switching up for whatever,

2:28:59.340 --> 2:29:02.380
 you know, changes that will come up for the rest of your life.

2:29:02.380 --> 2:29:08.100
 So I wouldn't trade that, that experience really for anything.

2:29:08.100 --> 2:29:14.860
 It's a huge aspect of who I am, and I'm sure you can relate to a lot of this.

2:29:14.860 --> 2:29:15.860
 Yes.

2:29:15.860 --> 2:29:22.420
 Is there advice from your life that you can give to young people today, high school, college,

2:29:22.420 --> 2:29:26.760
 you know, about their career, or maybe about life in general?

2:29:26.760 --> 2:29:32.020
 I'm not like a career coach, but I'm definitely not a life coach.

2:29:32.020 --> 2:29:33.900
 I don't have it all figured out.

2:29:33.900 --> 2:29:45.420
 But I think there's a perpetual cycle of, you know, thinking that there is a, there's

2:29:45.420 --> 2:29:48.900
 kind of like a template for success, right?

2:29:48.900 --> 2:29:56.380
 Maybe there is, but in my experience, I haven't seen it, right?

2:29:56.380 --> 2:30:01.540
 You know, I would say people in high school, right?

2:30:01.540 --> 2:30:07.260
 So much of their focus is on getting straight A's, filling their CV with this and this and

2:30:07.260 --> 2:30:13.020
 this so that it looks impressive, right?

2:30:13.020 --> 2:30:17.420
 That is not, I think, a good way to optimize your life, right?

2:30:17.420 --> 2:30:20.580
 Do the thing that fills your life with passion.

2:30:20.580 --> 2:30:24.940
 Do the thing that fills your life with interest.

2:30:24.940 --> 2:30:28.300
 And you know, do that perpetually, right?

2:30:28.300 --> 2:30:36.140
 A straight A student, you know, is really impressive, but also, you know, somewhat boring,

2:30:36.140 --> 2:30:37.140
 right?

2:30:37.140 --> 2:30:44.380
 So, I think, you know, injection of more of that kind of interest into the lives of young

2:30:44.380 --> 2:30:51.540
 people would go a long way in just both upping their level of happiness and then just kind

2:30:51.540 --> 2:30:58.740
 of ensuring that, looking forward, they are not suffering from a, you know, perpetual

2:30:58.740 --> 2:31:04.500
 condition of, oh, I have to satisfy these, like, you know, check boxes to do well, right?

2:31:04.500 --> 2:31:08.100
 Because you can lose yourself in that whole process for the rest of your life, but it's

2:31:08.100 --> 2:31:13.520
 nice if it's possible, like Max Tegmark was exceptionally good at this at MIT, figure

2:31:13.520 --> 2:31:20.020
 out how you can spend a small part of your, percent of your efforts that, such that your

2:31:20.020 --> 2:31:21.940
 CV looks really impressive.

2:31:21.940 --> 2:31:23.980
 Yeah, absolutely.

2:31:23.980 --> 2:31:31.500
 There's no, like, without a doubt, like, that's a baseline that you need to have.

2:31:31.500 --> 2:31:35.300
 And then, so like, spend most of your time doing like amazing things you're passionate

2:31:35.300 --> 2:31:44.540
 about, but such that it kind of like Planet Nine produces objects that feed your CV, like,

2:31:44.540 --> 2:31:45.540
 slowly over time.

2:31:45.540 --> 2:31:50.460
 Like getting good grades in high school, maybe doing extracurricular activities or in terms

2:31:50.460 --> 2:31:55.100
 of like, you know, for programmers that's producing code that you can show up on GitHub,

2:31:55.100 --> 2:32:01.780
 like leaving traces, like, throughout your efforts, such that your CV looks impressive

2:32:01.780 --> 2:32:02.820
 to the rest of the world.

2:32:02.820 --> 2:32:08.500
 In fact, I mean, this is somewhat along the lines of what I'm talking about, see, like,

2:32:08.500 --> 2:32:14.540
 getting like good grades is important, but grades are not a tangible, like, product.

2:32:14.540 --> 2:32:21.620
 You cannot, you know, show your A and have your A live a separate life from you.

2:32:21.620 --> 2:32:24.260
 Code very much does, right?

2:32:24.260 --> 2:32:31.580
 Music very much takes on, you know, provided somebody else listens to it, like, takes on

2:32:31.580 --> 2:32:33.100
 a life of its own.

2:32:33.100 --> 2:32:36.620
 That's kind of what I mean, right?

2:32:36.620 --> 2:32:45.980
 Creating stuff that can then get separated from you is exceptionally attractive, right?

2:32:45.980 --> 2:32:47.620
 It's like a fun and...

2:32:47.620 --> 2:32:50.060
 And it's also very impressive to others.

2:32:50.060 --> 2:32:54.740
 I think we're moving to a world where grades mean less and less, like certifications mean

2:32:54.740 --> 2:32:55.900
 less and less.

2:32:55.900 --> 2:33:02.660
 If you look at, especially again in the computing fields, getting a degree, finishing your,

2:33:02.660 --> 2:33:07.400
 especially just finishing your degree, whether it's bachelor's or master's or PhD is less

2:33:07.400 --> 2:33:11.660
 important than the things you've actually put out into the world.

2:33:11.660 --> 2:33:16.700
 And that's a fascinating kind of, that's great that in that sense, the meritocracy is in

2:33:16.700 --> 2:33:20.860
 its richest, most beautiful form is starting to win out.

2:33:20.860 --> 2:33:26.020
 Yeah, it's weird because like, you know, my understanding, and I'm not like, I don't know

2:33:26.020 --> 2:33:31.420
 the history of science well enough to speak very confidently about this, but, you know,

2:33:31.420 --> 2:33:39.380
 the advisor of my advisor of my advisor from undergrad, like didn't have a PhD, right?

2:33:39.380 --> 2:33:49.580
 So I think it was a more common thing back in the day, even in the academic sector to,

2:33:49.580 --> 2:33:56.740
 you know, not have, you know, Faraday, like Faraday didn't know algebra and drew diagrams

2:33:56.740 --> 2:34:03.900
 about, you know, magnetic fields and Faraday's law was derived entirely from intuition.

2:34:03.900 --> 2:34:11.820
 So it is interesting to how the world of academia has evolved into a, you've got to do this

2:34:11.820 --> 2:34:17.620
 and then get PhD, then you have to postdoc once and twice and maybe thrice and then like

2:34:17.620 --> 2:34:18.820
 you move on.

2:34:18.820 --> 2:34:25.580
 So, you know, it does, I do wonder, you know, if we're, you know, if there's a better approach.

2:34:25.580 --> 2:34:29.500
 I think we're heading there, but it's a fascinating historical perspective, like that we might

2:34:29.500 --> 2:34:34.340
 have just tried this whole thing out for a while where we put a lot more emphasis on

2:34:34.340 --> 2:34:38.100
 grades and certificates and degrees and all those kinds of things.

2:34:38.100 --> 2:34:43.860
 I think the difference historically is like we can actually, using the internet, show

2:34:43.860 --> 2:34:51.060
 off ourselves and our creations better and better and more effectively, whether that's

2:34:51.060 --> 2:34:54.020
 code or producing videos or all those kinds of things.

2:34:54.020 --> 2:34:55.020
 That's right.

2:34:55.020 --> 2:35:00.740
 I want to become a certified drone pilot.

2:35:00.740 --> 2:35:03.420
 Of all the things you want to pick, yeah, for sure.

2:35:03.420 --> 2:35:06.820
 Or you could just fly and make YouTube videos against hundreds of thousands of views with

2:35:06.820 --> 2:35:10.140
 your drone and never getting a certificate.

2:35:10.140 --> 2:35:11.140
 That's probably illegal.

2:35:11.140 --> 2:35:12.140
 Don't do it.

2:35:12.140 --> 2:35:14.460
 What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

2:35:14.460 --> 2:35:23.100
 So you look at planets, they seem to orbit stuff without asking the why question.

2:35:23.100 --> 2:35:28.140
 And for some reason, life emerged on Earth such that it led to big brains that can ask

2:35:28.140 --> 2:35:30.300
 the big why question.

2:35:30.300 --> 2:35:34.980
 Do you think there's an answer to it?

2:35:34.980 --> 2:35:37.380
 I'm not sure what the question is.

2:35:37.380 --> 2:35:38.380
 Meaning of life?

2:35:38.380 --> 2:35:40.460
 The meaning of life.

2:35:40.460 --> 2:35:41.460
 It's 42.

2:35:41.460 --> 2:35:42.460
 It's 42.

2:35:42.460 --> 2:35:43.460
 Yeah.

2:35:43.460 --> 2:35:54.820
 But aside from that, I think the question you're asking is why we do all this, right?

2:35:54.820 --> 2:35:58.220
 Why we do all this.

2:35:58.220 --> 2:36:00.780
 It's part of the human condition, right?

2:36:00.780 --> 2:36:11.300
 Human beings are fundamentally, I feel like, sort of stochastic and fundamentally interested

2:36:11.300 --> 2:36:18.060
 in kind of expanding our own understanding of the world around us.

2:36:18.060 --> 2:36:21.640
 And creating stuff to enable that understanding.

2:36:21.640 --> 2:36:24.260
 So we're like stochastic, fundamentally stochastic.

2:36:24.260 --> 2:36:27.940
 So like there's just a bunch of randomness that really doesn't seem like it has a good

2:36:27.940 --> 2:36:33.180
 explanation and yet there's a kind of direction to our being that we just keep wanting to

2:36:33.180 --> 2:36:34.700
 create and to understand.

2:36:34.700 --> 2:36:35.700
 That's right.

2:36:35.700 --> 2:36:41.580
 There are people that claim to be anti science, right?

2:36:41.580 --> 2:36:50.420
 And yet in their anti science discussion, they're like, well, if you're so scientific,

2:36:50.420 --> 2:36:54.340
 then why don't you explain to me how, I don't know, this works.

2:36:54.340 --> 2:37:00.580
 And like it always, there's that fundamental seed of curiosity and interest that is common

2:37:00.580 --> 2:37:02.940
 to all of us.

2:37:02.940 --> 2:37:08.900
 That is absolutely what makes us human, right?

2:37:08.900 --> 2:37:16.980
 And I'm in a privileged position of being able to have that be my job, right?

2:37:16.980 --> 2:37:26.480
 I think as time evolves forward and the kind of economy changes, I mean, we're already

2:37:26.480 --> 2:37:36.740
 starting to see a shift towards that type of creative enterprise as taking over a bigger

2:37:36.740 --> 2:37:39.100
 and bigger chunk of the sector.

2:37:39.100 --> 2:37:45.300
 It's not yet, I think, the dominant portion of the economy by any account.

2:37:45.300 --> 2:37:53.540
 But if we compare this to sometime when the dominant thing you would do would be to go

2:37:53.540 --> 2:38:00.980
 to a factory and do the same exact thing, I think there's a tide there and things are

2:38:00.980 --> 2:38:02.660
 sort of headed in that direction.

2:38:02.660 --> 2:38:04.500
 Yeah, life's becoming more and more fun.

2:38:04.500 --> 2:38:05.500
 I can't wait.

2:38:05.500 --> 2:38:06.500
 Honestly, what happens next?

2:38:06.500 --> 2:38:07.500
 I can't wait to just chill.

2:38:07.500 --> 2:38:08.500
 Just chill.

2:38:08.500 --> 2:38:13.900
 The terminal point of this is just chill and wait for those Kuiper Belt objects to complete

2:38:13.900 --> 2:38:14.900
 one orbit.

2:38:14.900 --> 2:38:17.260
 I'm going to credit you with this idea.

2:38:17.260 --> 2:38:24.020
 I do hope that we definitively discover a proof that there is a Planet 9 out there in

2:38:24.020 --> 2:38:29.700
 the next few years so you can sit back with a cigar or cigarette or vodka or wine and

2:38:29.700 --> 2:38:32.160
 just say, I told you so.

2:38:32.160 --> 2:38:33.160
 That's already happening.

2:38:33.160 --> 2:38:36.580
 I'm going to do that later tonight.

2:38:36.580 --> 2:38:40.420
 As I mentioned, confidence is essential to being a rock star.

2:38:40.420 --> 2:38:45.020
 I really appreciate you explaining so many fascinating things to me today.

2:38:45.020 --> 2:38:50.220
 I really appreciate the work that you do out there and I really appreciate you talking

2:38:50.220 --> 2:38:51.220
 with me today.

2:38:51.220 --> 2:38:52.220
 Thanks, Constantine.

2:38:52.220 --> 2:38:53.220
 It was a pleasure.

2:38:53.220 --> 2:38:54.220
 Thanks for having me on.

2:38:54.220 --> 2:38:57.500
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Constantine Batygin and thank you to

2:38:57.500 --> 2:39:02.500
 Squarespace, Litterati, Onnit, And, and I.

2:39:02.500 --> 2:39:06.260
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:39:06.260 --> 2:39:10.220
 And now let me leave you with some words from Douglas Adams in the Hitchhiker's Guide to

2:39:10.220 --> 2:39:12.300
 the Galaxy.

2:39:12.300 --> 2:39:18.440
 Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm

2:39:18.440 --> 2:39:23.980
 of the galaxy lies a small, unregarded yellow sun.

2:39:23.980 --> 2:39:30.020
 Orbiting this at a distance of roughly 92 million miles is an utterly insignificant

2:39:30.020 --> 2:39:36.580
 little blue green planet whose ape descendant life forms are so amazingly primitive that

2:39:36.580 --> 2:39:41.960
 they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.

2:39:41.960 --> 2:39:44.500
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
