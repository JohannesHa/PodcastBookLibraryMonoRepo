00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
 The following is a conversation with Sagar Anjati.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.760
 He is a DC based political correspondent,

00:05.760 --> 00:08.160
 host of The Rising with Crystal Ball

00:08.160 --> 00:12.600
 and host of the realignment podcast with Marshall Kozloff.

00:12.600 --> 00:16.480
 He has interviewed Donald Trump four times

00:16.480 --> 00:19.760
 and has interviewed a lot of major political figures

00:19.760 --> 00:23.080
 and human beings who wield power.

00:23.080 --> 00:25.880
 He loves policy and loves history,

00:25.880 --> 00:27.960
 which makes him a great person to sail

00:27.960 --> 00:32.680
 through the sometimes stormy waters of political discourse.

00:32.680 --> 00:35.440
 He showed up to this conversation with a gift

00:35.440 --> 00:40.200
 of the second volume of Ian Kershaw's biography on Hitler,

00:40.200 --> 00:42.360
 a two volume set that is widely acknowledged

00:42.360 --> 00:45.200
 as one of the greatest, if not the greatest,

00:45.200 --> 00:48.320
 most definitive studies of Hitler.

00:48.320 --> 00:51.400
 Nothing wins my heart faster on a first meeting

00:51.400 --> 00:55.160
 or first date than a great book about the darkest aspects

00:55.160 --> 00:57.520
 of human nature and human history.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.360
 I think I started saying that as a joke,

00:59.360 --> 01:01.560
 but actually there's probably a lot of truth to it.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.200
 I love it when we skip the small talk

01:03.200 --> 01:05.480
 and go straight to the in depth conversation

01:05.480 --> 01:09.000
 about the best and worst of human nature.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.480

01:23.340 --> 01:26.600
 As a side note, let me say that for better or for worse,

01:26.600 --> 01:27.920
 I would like to avoid the trap

01:27.920 --> 01:30.460
 of surface political bickering of the day.

01:30.460 --> 01:32.460
 I do find politics fascinating,

01:32.460 --> 01:34.240
 but not the talking points produced

01:34.240 --> 01:37.140
 by the industrial engagement complex

01:37.140 --> 01:38.920
 of red versus blue division.

01:38.920 --> 01:42.520
 Instead, I'm fascinated by human beings who seek power

01:42.520 --> 01:44.920
 and how power changes them.

01:44.920 --> 01:47.000
 I don't have a political affiliation

01:47.000 --> 01:49.120
 and my ideas, at least I hope so,

01:49.120 --> 01:51.800
 are defined more by curiosity and learning

01:51.800 --> 01:53.400
 in the face of uncertainty

01:53.400 --> 01:56.560
 and less by the echo chambers who tell me

01:56.560 --> 01:58.460
 what I'm supposed to think.

01:58.460 --> 02:00.920
 I'm constantly evolving, learning,

02:00.920 --> 02:04.280
 and doing my best to do so without ego and with empathy.

02:04.280 --> 02:05.960
 Please be patient with me.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.040
 As far as I'm aware,

02:07.040 --> 02:09.400
 I do not have any derangement syndromes,

02:09.400 --> 02:11.120
 nor do I get a medical prescription

02:11.120 --> 02:14.420
 of blue, red, white, or black pills.

02:14.420 --> 02:18.240
 If I say something, I say it because I'm genuinely thinking

02:18.240 --> 02:21.120
 and struggling with the ideas.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.840
 I have no agenda, just a bit of a hope

02:23.840 --> 02:26.680
 to add more love to the world.

 And now, here's my conversation with Sagar Anjati.

02:41.120 --> 02:44.760
 There's no better gifts in this world

02:44.760 --> 02:47.840
 than a book about Hitler, so thank you so much.

02:47.840 --> 02:50.780
 I've gotten a gift when we were just talking about flying,

02:50.780 --> 02:52.400
 the watch from Joe Rogan,

02:52.400 --> 02:54.400
 and this almost beats it.

02:54.400 --> 02:58.800
 So tell me what this particular book on Hitler is.

02:58.800 --> 02:59.880
 So this is volume two.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.980
 Yes, so this is Ian Kershaw.

03:01.980 --> 03:04.520
 He wrote the famous two volume on Hitler.

03:04.520 --> 03:05.800
 I'm a big book nerd,

03:05.800 --> 03:09.180
 and I spend a lot of time reading biographies in particular.

03:09.180 --> 03:11.940
 So this one, if you need a one volume,

03:11.940 --> 03:13.840
 "'Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,' right?

03:13.840 --> 03:15.520
 I think you talked about that, William Shire,

03:15.520 --> 03:17.540
 because that's like Hitler's rise,

03:17.540 --> 03:19.320
 Nazi Germany, the war, et cetera.

03:19.320 --> 03:23.760
 But I like bios because a good biography

03:23.760 --> 03:25.200
 is story of the times, right?

03:25.200 --> 03:28.380
 And so this one, the first volume, it does exactly that,

03:28.380 --> 03:30.880
 which is that it doesn't just tell the story of Hitler.

03:30.880 --> 03:34.200
 It's the context of this kid in Austria,

03:34.200 --> 03:35.320
 and he's got all these dreams,

03:35.320 --> 03:37.380
 but then actually pretty courageous

03:37.380 --> 03:38.840
 in terms of World War I, right?

03:38.840 --> 03:40.760
 Gets pinned to metal on by the Kaiser.

03:40.760 --> 03:44.120
 And then what it's like to lose World War I,

03:44.120 --> 03:47.000
 and actually lose this stain,

03:47.000 --> 03:49.800
 and then the rise within, everybody knows that story,

03:49.800 --> 03:51.560
 the Beer Hall Putsch and all that.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.960
 This one I like, and the reason I like Kershaw

03:53.960 --> 03:55.680
 is obviously number one, it's English,

03:55.680 --> 03:57.000
 which is actually hard, right?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.560
 Like in order to write that story,

03:58.560 --> 04:01.060
 who can do both the primary source material

04:01.060 --> 04:03.180
 and then translate it for people like us,

04:03.180 --> 04:08.020
 but he tells the dynamic story of Hitler so well

04:08.020 --> 04:10.920
 in the second volume, just like the level of detail.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.220
 You've talked about this, Lex,

04:12.220 --> 04:14.880
 like what was it like inside that room,

04:14.880 --> 04:16.200
 inside with Chamberlain?

04:16.200 --> 04:19.240
 Like what was it like in terms of who was this

04:19.240 --> 04:22.520
 like magnetic madman who did convince

04:22.520 --> 04:24.680
 the smartest people in the world at the time?

04:24.680 --> 04:28.900
 And up until like 1940, the Soviet gamble,

04:28.900 --> 04:33.900
 like it took tremendous risks, but like highly calculated,

04:34.320 --> 04:36.480
 thinking, no, no, no, I'm not gonna pay for this one.

04:36.480 --> 04:37.760
 I'm not gonna pay for this one.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.520
 And it put himself, he had a remarkable ability,

04:40.520 --> 04:42.920
 not just to put himself in the minds of the German people,

04:42.920 --> 04:44.400
 but in terms of his adversaries,

04:44.400 --> 04:46.600
 like with when he was across from Mussolini.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.760
 Calculate, he's like, how exactly did Mussolini,

04:48.760 --> 04:49.800
 the guy who created fascism,

04:49.800 --> 04:52.440
 becomes like second fiddle to Hitler?

04:52.440 --> 04:53.640
 Think it's an amazing bio.

04:53.640 --> 04:57.920
 And yeah, like Ian Kershaw, along with Richard Evans,

04:57.920 --> 05:00.280
 two of my favorite authors on the Third Reich, no question.

05:00.280 --> 05:01.600
 Do you think he was born this way,

05:01.600 --> 05:03.360
 that charisma, whatever that is?

05:03.360 --> 05:06.040
 Or was it something he developed strategically?

05:06.040 --> 05:07.200
 That's like the question you apply

05:07.200 --> 05:09.200
 to some of the great leaders.

05:09.200 --> 05:13.520
 Was he just a madman who had the instinct

05:13.520 --> 05:15.280
 to be able to control people

05:15.280 --> 05:16.540
 in the room together with them?

05:16.540 --> 05:17.960
 Or is this like, he worked at it?

05:17.960 --> 05:19.280
 I think he worked at it.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.620
 But also, there is an innate quality.

05:21.620 --> 05:24.280
 I'm forgetting his name, his lifelong,

05:24.280 --> 05:27.960
 Rudolf, the one who flew to Berlin in like 1940.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.320
 I forget his name, anyway.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.560
 So he helped Hitler write Mein Kampf.

05:31.560 --> 05:35.600
 And he was like slavishly devoted to him in prison.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.560
 This is 1925 or something like that.

05:38.560 --> 05:39.880
 And so you read that and you're like,

05:39.880 --> 05:42.960
 well, how does he get this like crank wacko

05:42.960 --> 05:45.280
 to basically believe he's like the second coming,

05:45.280 --> 05:46.640
 help him write this book?

05:46.640 --> 05:49.400
 I mean, literally, they live together in the prison cell

05:49.400 --> 05:50.460
 and they wake up every day.

05:50.460 --> 05:52.440
 And as he was composing Mein Kampf

05:52.440 --> 05:54.760
 and because of the Beer Hall Putsch and all that,

05:54.760 --> 05:59.000
 had this like absolute ability to gather people around him.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.760
 I think his greatest skill was,

06:00.760 --> 06:03.080
 is he was just a very good politician, truly.

06:03.080 --> 06:05.040
 I mean, if you look at his ability

06:05.040 --> 06:07.600
 in order to read coalitional politics

06:07.600 --> 06:10.360
 and then convince exactly the right people

06:10.360 --> 06:12.040
 in order to follow him.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.360
 I think I heard you ask this once

06:13.360 --> 06:14.480
 and I've thought about it a lot,

06:14.480 --> 06:17.440
 which is like, who could have stopped Hitler in Germany?

06:17.440 --> 06:19.040
 It's always like the ever present question.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.200
 Of course, like the whole baby Hitler thing.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.640
 Really the answer is Hindenburg.

06:22.640 --> 06:25.000
 Like Hindenburg was the person who could have stopped

06:25.000 --> 06:27.980
 and had the immense standing within the German public.

06:27.980 --> 06:30.880
 The only real like war hero

06:30.880 --> 06:34.720
 definitely was personally skeptical of fascism and Nazism.

06:34.720 --> 06:35.760
 And didn't like Hitler.

06:35.760 --> 06:38.240
 And didn't like him and he knew he was full of shit.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.160
 He was like, yeah, I think this guy is dangerous.

06:40.160 --> 06:43.680
 I think this guy could do a lot of damage to the Republic.

06:43.680 --> 06:46.960
 But he acceded basically to Hitler at the time.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.760
 And I think that he was one of the main people

06:48.760 --> 06:50.160
 who could have done something about it.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.760
 And also he was able to convince the generals, the military.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.600
 I mean, that was very interesting.

06:56.600 --> 07:01.520
 And to convince Chamberlain and the other political leaders.

07:01.520 --> 07:04.180
 That's something I often think about

07:04.180 --> 07:06.700
 because we're just reading books about these people.

07:06.700 --> 07:09.040
 I think about what like Jeffrey Epstein, for example.

07:09.040 --> 07:12.480
 Like evil people, not evil,

07:12.480 --> 07:14.160
 but people have done evil things.

07:14.160 --> 07:17.720
 Let's not go to the Dan Carlin thing of what is evil.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.440
 People that do evil things,

07:21.440 --> 07:23.300
 I wonder what they are like in a room

07:23.300 --> 07:25.800
 because I know quite a lot of intelligent people

07:25.800 --> 07:30.800
 that did not see the evil in Jeffrey Epstein

07:33.720 --> 07:35.040
 and spend time with them.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.040
 And were not bothered by it.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.360
 In the same sense, Hitler,

07:40.360 --> 07:43.080
 it seems like he was able to get,

07:43.080 --> 07:45.920
 just even before he had power,

07:45.920 --> 07:48.520
 because people get intoxicated by power and so on.

07:48.520 --> 07:49.680
 They want to be close to power.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.120
 But even before he had power,

07:51.120 --> 07:52.700
 he was able to convince people.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.360
 And it's unclear,

07:55.360 --> 07:58.880
 like is there something that's more than words?

07:58.880 --> 08:01.140
 It's like the way you,

08:01.140 --> 08:04.560
 I mean, people talk, tell stories about like this piercing

08:04.560 --> 08:06.760
 look and whatever, all that kind of stuff.

08:06.760 --> 08:10.240
 I wonder if that's somehow a part of it.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.600
 Like that has to be the base floor

08:12.600 --> 08:14.600
 of any of these charismatic leaders.

08:14.600 --> 08:17.800
 You have to be able to, in a room alone,

08:17.800 --> 08:20.280
 be able to convince anybody of anything.

08:20.280 --> 08:23.120
 So I can tell you from my personal experience,

08:23.120 --> 08:26.480
 one of the best educated lessons I got

08:26.480 --> 08:29.360
 was when I got to meet Trump.

08:29.360 --> 08:32.480
 So I interviewed Trump four different times as a journalist,

08:32.480 --> 08:36.320
 spent like two and a half hours with him in the Oval Office,

08:36.320 --> 08:38.820
 not alone, but like me and one person

08:38.820 --> 08:40.660
 and like the press secretary, and that was it.

08:40.660 --> 08:42.480
 So I actually got to observe him.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.320
 And as a guy who reads these types of books,

08:45.320 --> 08:48.340
 and you think of Trump, obviously most people,

08:48.340 --> 08:51.720
 what they see on television, in articles and more,

08:51.720 --> 08:53.960
 but being able to observe it like one on one,

08:53.960 --> 08:57.600
 I was closer to him than I am right now from you.

08:57.600 --> 09:01.540
 That was one of the most educational experiences I got

09:01.540 --> 09:03.140
 because it's like you just said,

09:03.140 --> 09:05.600
 the look, the leaning forward,

09:05.600 --> 09:10.240
 the way he talks, the way he is a master

09:10.240 --> 09:11.920
 at taking the question

09:11.920 --> 09:14.040
 and answering exactly which party wants.

09:14.040 --> 09:15.120
 And then if you try and follow up,

09:15.120 --> 09:18.280
 he's like, excuse me, you know, like he knows.

09:18.280 --> 09:19.600
 And then whenever you're talking,

09:19.600 --> 09:22.240
 it's not that he's annoyed about getting interrupted.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.400
 If he realizes he's been mirandering

09:24.400 --> 09:26.040
 and then you interrupt him, all good.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.320
 But if he's driving home a point,

09:28.320 --> 09:31.160
 which he has to make sure appears in your transcript

09:31.160 --> 09:36.160
 or whatever, it really was fascinating for me to look at.

09:36.320 --> 09:39.040
 And what was also crazy with Trump

09:39.040 --> 09:41.880
 is I realized how much he was living in the moment.

09:41.880 --> 09:44.680
 So when I went to the Oval,

09:44.680 --> 09:46.880
 I've read all these biographies and I walk in,

09:46.880 --> 09:50.800
 I'm like, holy shit, you're like, I'm in the Oval Office.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.280
 Were you interviewing him in the Oval Office?

09:52.280 --> 09:53.920
 In the Oval, every time, I was in the Oval Office.

09:53.920 --> 09:54.760
 You scared shitless?

09:54.760 --> 09:56.600
 Well, I wasn't scared.

09:56.600 --> 09:59.320
 I was just, look, it's the Oval Office, right?

09:59.320 --> 10:01.480
 I mean, I'm this nerd.

10:01.480 --> 10:05.280
 He was like this kid, I'm so, I will admit this here.

10:05.280 --> 10:08.040
 I printed out on my dad's label maker when I was like seven

10:08.040 --> 10:10.000
 and I wrote the Oval Office on my bedroom.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.680
 So I was a huge nerd, obviously egomaniacal, even from seven.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.760
 But so for this, I mean, it was huge, right?

10:16.760 --> 10:18.400
 I'm like this 25 year old kid.

10:18.400 --> 10:22.160
 And I walk in there and I see the couch, right?

10:22.160 --> 10:25.240
 And I'm like, oh man, that's Kissinger.

10:25.240 --> 10:28.120
 That's where Kissinger and Nixon got on their knees.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.840
 And then you see over by the door and you're like,

10:29.840 --> 10:31.200
 are the scuff marks still there

10:31.200 --> 10:33.040
 from when Eisenhower used to play golf?

10:33.040 --> 10:34.480
 You know, this is all running through my mind.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.360
 With Trump, none of it was there, none of it, right?

10:36.360 --> 10:39.520
 So like, even the desk, I put my phone on the desk

10:39.520 --> 10:43.320
 to record and I'm like, this is the fucking Resolute desk.

10:43.320 --> 10:46.120
 Like, I shouldn't put my phone on this thing, right?

10:46.120 --> 10:49.120
 And I'm like HMS Resolute, you know, all the international.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.600
 And even for him, he doesn't think about any of it.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.440
 It was like amazing to me.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.440
 Like he had this portrait of Andrew Jackson

10:55.440 --> 10:58.320
 right next to his, to the, I think from on the fireplace,

10:58.320 --> 10:59.840
 like right here on the right.

10:59.840 --> 11:02.500
 And the most revealing question was when I was like,

11:02.500 --> 11:04.440
 Mr. President, what are people gonna remember you for

11:04.440 --> 11:05.480
 in a hundred years?

11:05.480 --> 11:09.120
 And he was like, I don't know, like veteran's choice.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.760
 He like has a list in front of him of like

11:11.760 --> 11:14.120
 his accomplishments, which is staff.

11:14.120 --> 11:17.080
 Yeah, well, I mean, that's what I wanted to know.

11:17.080 --> 11:18.880
 And he's like, veteran's choice.

11:18.880 --> 11:20.440
 And I remember looking at him being like,

11:20.440 --> 11:22.480
 it's not gonna be veteran's choice.

11:22.480 --> 11:25.600
 I'd be like, I'm like, I'm looking at you, Donald Trump,

11:25.600 --> 11:27.840
 the harbinger of something new.

11:27.840 --> 11:29.720
 We still don't know what the hell it is.

11:29.720 --> 11:33.440
 And so I realized with these guys and their charisma

11:33.440 --> 11:35.820
 and more is that they don't think about themselves

11:35.820 --> 11:37.280
 the way that we think about them.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.960
 And that was actually important to understand

11:38.960 --> 11:40.360
 because a lot of people are like,

11:40.360 --> 11:41.720
 Trump is playing all this chess.

11:41.720 --> 11:43.160
 I'm like, I assure you he's not.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.320
 Like he's truly, one time I was interviewing him

11:46.320 --> 11:48.360
 and he had like a certificate that he had to sign

11:48.360 --> 11:49.800
 or something on his desk.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.440
 He's like, it was like child almost.

11:51.440 --> 11:53.600
 Like he got distracted by, he's like, oh, what's this?

11:53.600 --> 11:55.200
 You know, he's just like picking up and I was like,

11:55.200 --> 11:57.720
 wow, like this, this is the guy.

11:57.720 --> 11:59.000
 Like this is what he is.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.200
 Well, I wonder if there was a different person

12:02.200 --> 12:05.800
 because you were recording then offline at a party.

12:05.800 --> 12:06.640
 I can tell you.

12:06.640 --> 12:07.460
 Well, here's the thing though,

12:07.460 --> 12:09.320
 because that's another part of it.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.280
 Because that two hours,

12:11.280 --> 12:13.480
 I would say like half of that was not on the record.

12:13.480 --> 12:15.360
 So like, whenever he's off the record,

12:15.360 --> 12:17.960
 he changes completely, right?

12:17.960 --> 12:20.560
 I don't wanna like go into too much of it or whatever,

12:20.560 --> 12:25.560
 but like he, I mean, he is so mindful

12:26.040 --> 12:29.120
 of when that camera is on and when the mic is hot

12:29.120 --> 12:30.840
 in terms of the language that he uses,

12:30.840 --> 12:32.160
 what he's willing to admit,

12:32.160 --> 12:33.680
 what he's willing to talk about,

12:33.680 --> 12:37.560
 how he's willing to even appear in front of his staff.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.160
 I think the most revealing thing Trump ever did

12:40.160 --> 12:41.940
 was there was this press conference,

12:41.940 --> 12:43.640
 like right after he lost the,

12:43.640 --> 12:46.240
 right after the midterm elections in 2018.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.560
 And one of the journalists was like,

12:47.560 --> 12:50.360
 Mr. President, thank you for doing this press conference.

12:50.360 --> 12:51.640
 And he looks at him and he goes,

12:51.640 --> 12:54.160
 it's called earned media, it's worth billions.

12:54.160 --> 12:57.560
 And he just like had so much disdain for him

12:57.560 --> 12:59.320
 because he's like, I'm not doing this for you.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.840
 He's like, I'm doing this for me.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.280
 So he's really aware of the narrative of the story.

13:03.280 --> 13:05.040
 I mean, that the people have talked about

13:05.040 --> 13:08.320
 that all comes from the tabloid media of the,

13:08.320 --> 13:09.640
 from New York and so on.

13:09.640 --> 13:10.840
 He's a master of that.

13:10.840 --> 13:14.140
 But I've also heard stories of just in private,

13:14.140 --> 13:18.140
 he's a really, I don't wanna overuse the word charismatic,

13:18.140 --> 13:21.400
 but just like, he is a really interesting,

13:21.400 --> 13:25.840
 almost like friendly, like a good person.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.040
 Like, that's what I heard.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.720
 I've heard actually surprising the same thing

13:29.720 --> 13:30.840
 about Hillary Clinton.

13:32.320 --> 13:33.160
 And like.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.020
 That I can't tell you anything about.

13:35.020 --> 13:37.720
 But like the way they present themselves

13:37.720 --> 13:40.560
 is perhaps very different than they are

13:40.560 --> 13:42.320
 as human beings and one on one.

13:42.320 --> 13:46.520
 That's something, maybe that's just like a skill thing.

13:46.520 --> 13:50.680
 Maybe the way they present themselves in public

13:50.680 --> 13:55.400
 is actually their, I mean, almost their real self.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.160
 And they're just really good in private,

13:58.160 --> 14:00.960
 one on one to go into this mode

14:00.960 --> 14:03.960
 of just being really intimate in some kind of human way.

14:03.960 --> 14:04.920
 I think that's part of it.

14:04.920 --> 14:06.760
 Because I noticed that with Trump, you know,

14:06.760 --> 14:08.720
 he's like, it's almost like a tour guide.

14:08.720 --> 14:11.240
 It was very like, it's very crazy, right?

14:11.240 --> 14:12.400
 Cause you're like, you're in the Oval.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.720
 I mean, it's his office.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.680
 And he's like, do you guys want anything?

14:15.680 --> 14:16.920
 And he's like, you want a Diet Coke?

14:16.920 --> 14:19.200
 Cause he drinks like all this Diet Coke.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.040
 You know?

14:20.040 --> 14:23.960
 And he's just like, you guys want a Diet Coke, right?

14:23.960 --> 14:26.040
 And you're sitting there and you're like,

14:26.040 --> 14:28.520
 the way he's able to like,

14:28.520 --> 14:30.200
 like the last time I interviewed him,

14:30.200 --> 14:33.240
 he wanted to do it outside.

14:33.240 --> 14:36.300
 Because he like, he's studied himself from all angles.

14:36.300 --> 14:38.520
 And he knows exactly how he looks on a camera

14:38.520 --> 14:39.840
 and with which lighting.

14:39.840 --> 14:42.080
 And so we were supposed to interview him on camera

14:42.080 --> 14:43.980
 in the Oval Office, which is actually rare.

14:43.980 --> 14:45.640
 Like you don't usually get that.

14:45.640 --> 14:48.360
 And they ended up moving it outside at the last minute.

14:48.360 --> 14:49.400
 And he came out and he's like,

14:49.400 --> 14:50.240
 I picked this spot for you.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.360
 He's like, great lighting.

14:51.360 --> 14:52.200
 Yeah.

14:52.200 --> 14:55.240
 I was like, you are your own like lighting director.

14:55.240 --> 14:56.080
 Yeah.

14:56.080 --> 14:56.900
 The president, right?

14:56.900 --> 14:57.740
 It's great.

14:57.740 --> 14:58.920
 It's so funny.

14:58.920 --> 15:02.640
 But it's like you said, he's very charismatic

15:02.640 --> 15:04.240
 and friendly.

15:04.240 --> 15:05.680
 I mean, you wouldn't know.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.000
 I mean, look, this is what I mean

15:07.000 --> 15:10.720
 in terms of the dynamism of these people that gets lost.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.280
 And I think even he knows that.

15:12.280 --> 15:14.200
 Like, I don't think he would want that side of him.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.120
 That I see, you know, that you see in those

15:16.120 --> 15:18.880
 off the record moments and more in order to come out

15:18.880 --> 15:21.040
 because he's very keen about

15:21.040 --> 15:23.360
 how exactly he presents to the public.

15:23.360 --> 15:25.360
 It's like, you know, even his presidential portrait,

15:25.360 --> 15:27.760
 everybody usually smiles and he refused to smile.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.980
 He was like, I want to look like Winston Churchill.

15:29.980 --> 15:31.360
 You know, like even he knew that.

15:31.360 --> 15:34.160
 Do you think he believes that he,

15:34.160 --> 15:38.520
 what he kind of implies that he is one of,

15:38.520 --> 15:41.960
 if not the greatest president in American history?

15:41.960 --> 15:43.380
 Like people kind of laugh at this,

15:43.380 --> 15:45.880
 but there's quite, I mean, there's quite a lot of people,

15:45.880 --> 15:47.340
 first of all, that make the argument

15:47.340 --> 15:50.360
 that he's the greatest president in history.

15:50.360 --> 15:52.440
 Like I've heard this argument being made.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.160
 And I mean, I don't know what the,

15:55.160 --> 15:57.280
 first of all, I don't care.

15:57.280 --> 16:01.200
 Like, you can't make an argument

16:01.200 --> 16:02.680
 that anyone is the greatest.

16:02.680 --> 16:05.600
 That's just, that just, I come from a school

16:05.600 --> 16:08.400
 of like being humble and modest and so on.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.840
 It's like, even Michael, you can't have that conversation.

16:11.840 --> 16:15.680
 Okay, so I like that he's humble enough to say

16:15.680 --> 16:17.840
 like Abraham Lincoln or whatever.

16:17.840 --> 16:18.680
 Like, I don't know.

16:18.680 --> 16:19.880
 He says maybe Lincoln.

16:19.880 --> 16:20.800
 Maybe. Remember that.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.600
 Maybe. He says maybe Lincoln.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.920
 Do you think he actually believes that?

16:24.920 --> 16:29.720
 Or is that something he understands will create news

16:29.720 --> 16:32.600
 and also perhaps more importantly,

16:32.600 --> 16:35.600
 piss off a large number of people?

16:35.600 --> 16:38.840
 Is he almost like a musician masterfully playing

16:38.840 --> 16:41.280
 the emotions of the public?

16:41.280 --> 16:46.280
 Or does he, or, and does he believe

16:46.320 --> 16:47.260
 when he looks in the mirror,

16:47.260 --> 16:49.880
 I'm one of the greatest men in history?

16:49.880 --> 16:51.600
 Combination of all three.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.820
 I do think he believes it.

16:52.820 --> 16:54.680
 And for the reason why is I don't think he knows

16:54.680 --> 16:55.880
 that much about US history.

16:55.880 --> 16:56.960
 I really mean that.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.720
 Like, and that's what I meant whenever I was in there

16:58.720 --> 17:01.180
 and I realized he was just living in the moment.

17:01.180 --> 17:03.720
 I don't think he knew all that much about why.

17:03.720 --> 17:06.320
 I mean, this is why he was elected in many ways, right?

17:06.320 --> 17:08.280
 So I'm not saying this is an orbit,

17:08.280 --> 17:10.600
 like I'm not making a judgment on this.

17:10.600 --> 17:12.920
 I'm just saying, I do think in his mind,

17:12.920 --> 17:15.720
 he does think he was one of the best presidents

17:15.720 --> 17:17.680
 in American history largely because,

17:17.680 --> 17:19.480
 and I encountered this with a lot of people who work for him,

17:19.480 --> 17:21.760
 which is that they didn't really know all that much

17:21.760 --> 17:25.000
 kind of about what came before and all that.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.280
 And it's not necessarily to hold it against them

17:27.280 --> 17:28.600
 because for in many ways,

17:28.600 --> 17:30.480
 that's what they were elected to do

17:30.480 --> 17:32.760
 or elected to be in many ways.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.440
 It's an interesting question whether knowing history,

17:35.440 --> 17:39.480
 being a student of history is productive

17:39.480 --> 17:40.400
 or counterproductive.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.440
 I tend to assume I really respect people

17:43.440 --> 17:46.520
 who are deeply like well read in history,

17:46.520 --> 17:51.200
 like presidents that are almost like history nerds.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.160
 I admire that.

17:53.160 --> 17:56.920
 But maybe that gets in the way of governance.

17:56.920 --> 17:57.760
 I don't know.

17:57.760 --> 18:01.080
 It's not, I'm just sort of playing devil's advocate

18:01.080 --> 18:03.000
 to my own beliefs,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.480
 but it's possible that focusing on the moment

18:05.480 --> 18:07.680
 and the issues and letting history,

18:07.680 --> 18:09.120
 it's like first principles thinking,

18:09.120 --> 18:12.160
 forget the lessons of the past

18:12.160 --> 18:15.280
 and just focus on common sense reasoning

18:15.280 --> 18:16.800
 through the problems of today.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.360
 Yeah, it's really hard question.

18:18.360 --> 18:19.560
 In terms of the modern era,

18:19.560 --> 18:21.720
 I mean, Obama was a student of history.

18:21.720 --> 18:25.040
 Like he used to have presidential biographers

18:25.040 --> 18:27.000
 and people over and I mean, famously,

18:27.000 --> 18:27.920
 like Robert de Caro,

18:27.920 --> 18:29.720
 one of my favorite presidential biographers,

18:29.720 --> 18:32.240
 he was invited to have dinner with Obama

18:32.240 --> 18:35.000
 and Obama would like pepper some of his,

18:35.000 --> 18:36.840
 it was interesting because he'd try and justify

18:36.840 --> 18:38.720
 some of the things he didn't do by being like,

18:38.720 --> 18:40.600
 well, if you look at what they had to do

18:40.600 --> 18:42.160
 and what I have to deal with,

18:42.160 --> 18:43.280
 mine's much harder.

18:43.280 --> 18:44.960
 So in that way, I was a little pissed off

18:44.960 --> 18:47.520
 because I'd be like, no, that actually like,

18:47.520 --> 18:50.600
 you're comparing apples to oranges and all that.

18:50.600 --> 18:53.040
 But if you look at Roosevelt,

18:53.040 --> 18:54.640
 Teddy Roosevelt in particular,

18:54.640 --> 18:57.480
 this was, I mean, a voracious reader,

18:57.480 --> 18:59.560
 not of just American history, all history.

18:59.560 --> 19:01.600
 That guy's just such a badass.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.440
 Incredible.

19:03.400 --> 19:07.040
 The only president who willed himself to greatness.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.360
 That's like the amazing thing about him.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.320
 He wasn't tested by a crisis, right?

19:10.320 --> 19:12.640
 Like it wasn't, no, he didn't have a civil war.

19:12.640 --> 19:13.480
 He didn't have World War II.

19:13.480 --> 19:15.080
 He didn't have to found the country, literally,

19:15.080 --> 19:17.680
 or like, didn't have to stave off that,

19:17.680 --> 19:20.720
 or he didn't buy Louisiana Purchase, like all that.

19:20.720 --> 19:25.040
 He literally came into a pretty static country

19:25.040 --> 19:27.760
 and he could have just governed with,

19:27.760 --> 19:30.040
 I mean, he was, the person who came before him

19:30.040 --> 19:33.560
 was assassinated, like he easily could have coasted,

19:33.560 --> 19:37.600
 but he literally willed the country into something more.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.560
 And that's always why I've focused a lot on him too,

19:40.560 --> 19:42.520
 because I'm like, that, in many ways,

19:42.520 --> 19:44.600
 I wouldn't say it's easy to be great during crisis.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.440
 I mean, like look at Trump, right?

19:46.440 --> 19:49.360
 But it can bring out the best within you,

19:49.360 --> 19:51.120
 but it's a whole other level

19:51.120 --> 19:53.120
 to bring out the best within yourself

19:53.120 --> 19:54.840
 just for the sake of doing it.

19:54.840 --> 19:56.360
 That's, I think is really interesting.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.200
 The speeches were amazing.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.240
 I'm also a sucker for great speeches

20:00.240 --> 20:04.360
 because I tend to see the role of the president

20:04.360 --> 20:08.400
 as in part like inspirer in chief,

20:08.400 --> 20:10.600
 sort of to be able to, I mean,

20:10.600 --> 20:12.120
 that's what great leaders do,

20:12.120 --> 20:14.200
 like CEOs of companies and so on,

20:14.200 --> 20:17.080
 establish a vision, a clear vision,

20:17.080 --> 20:19.760
 and like hit that hard.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.360
 But the way you establish the vision isn't just like,

20:23.400 --> 20:24.680
 not to dig at Joe Biden,

20:24.680 --> 20:29.040
 but like sleepy, boring statements.

20:29.040 --> 20:31.240
 You have to sell those statements

20:31.240 --> 20:34.080
 and you have to do it in a way

20:34.080 --> 20:35.520
 where everybody's paying attention.

20:35.520 --> 20:36.960
 Everybody's excited.

20:36.960 --> 20:40.480
 And that, Teddy Roosevelt was definitely one of them.

20:40.480 --> 20:44.000
 Obama was, I think, at least early on,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.680
 I don't know, was incredible at that.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.840
 It does feel that the modern political landscape

20:49.840 --> 20:52.800
 makes it more difficult to be inspirational in a sense

20:52.800 --> 20:55.400
 because everything becomes bickering and division.

20:55.400 --> 20:58.600
 I do want to ask you about Trump.

21:00.320 --> 21:03.840
 So you're now a successful podcaster.

21:03.840 --> 21:07.800
 I've talked to Joe about Trump, Joe Rogan,

21:07.800 --> 21:11.440
 and Joe's not interested in talking to Trump.

21:11.440 --> 21:12.400
 It's just fascinating.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.280
 I try to dig into like why.

21:16.160 --> 21:20.240
 What would you interview Trump on like realignment,

21:20.240 --> 21:24.440
 for example, and do you think it's possible

21:24.440 --> 21:27.640
 to do a two, three hour conversation with him

21:27.640 --> 21:31.160
 where you will get at something like human

21:31.160 --> 21:33.840
 or you get at something, like when we're talking

21:33.840 --> 21:35.960
 about the facade he puts forward,

21:35.960 --> 21:37.960
 do you think you could get past that?

21:37.960 --> 21:39.240
 No, I don't.

21:39.240 --> 21:41.720
 I look, I was a White House correspondent.

21:41.720 --> 21:45.040
 I observed this man very closely.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.320
 I interviewed him.

21:46.320 --> 21:49.360
 I think if that mic is hot, he knows what he's doing.

21:49.360 --> 21:52.040
 He just, he's done this too long, Lex.

21:52.040 --> 21:52.880
 He just knows.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.600
 But do you think he's a different human now

21:54.600 --> 21:56.080
 after the election?

21:56.080 --> 21:56.920
 Do you think that?

21:56.920 --> 21:59.160
 Yeah, not at all.

21:59.160 --> 22:02.800
 I think he's been the same person since 1976.

22:02.800 --> 22:03.720
 I really do.

22:03.720 --> 22:07.120
 Like basically, 1976, I studied Trump a lot

22:07.120 --> 22:10.120
 and I think he's basically been the core

22:10.120 --> 22:12.800
 of who he is and elements of that.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.720
 Ever since he built that, you know,

22:14.720 --> 22:18.640
 the ice rink in Central Park and got that media attention,

22:18.640 --> 22:19.480
 that was it.

22:19.480 --> 22:20.960
 Yeah, he's a fascinating study.

22:20.960 --> 22:24.840
 Still, I feel there's a hope in me

22:24.840 --> 22:28.520
 that there would be a podcast like a Joe Rogan,

22:28.520 --> 22:31.560
 like a long form podcast where it's something could be,

22:31.560 --> 22:33.440
 you know, and you're actually a really good person

22:33.440 --> 22:37.840
 to do that, where you can have a real conversation

22:37.840 --> 22:40.360
 that looks back at the election and reveal something on us.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.840
 But perhaps he's thinking about running again

22:42.840 --> 22:46.280
 and so maybe he'll never let down that guard.

22:46.280 --> 22:48.320
 But like, you know, I just love it when

22:49.640 --> 22:54.640
 there's this switch in people where you start looking back

22:55.480 --> 22:57.840
 at your life and wanting to tell stories.

22:57.840 --> 23:01.280
 Like, you know, trying to extract wisdom

23:01.280 --> 23:03.640
 and like realizing you're in this new phase of life

23:03.640 --> 23:06.320
 where like the battles have all been fought,

23:06.320 --> 23:10.360
 now you're this old, like former warrior

23:10.360 --> 23:12.520
 and now you can tell the stories of that time.

23:12.520 --> 23:14.720
 And it seems like Trump is still at it,

23:14.720 --> 23:16.160
 like the young warrior he is,

23:16.160 --> 23:18.400
 he's not in the mode of telling stories.

23:18.400 --> 23:19.600
 You know what I got from Rogan?

23:19.600 --> 23:22.720
 He's the only president who didn't age well in office.

23:22.720 --> 23:23.720
 It's true, right?

23:23.720 --> 23:25.240
 Like, and this is what I mean,

23:25.240 --> 23:28.640
 because he lives in the moment, like the job actually

23:28.640 --> 23:32.560
 aged Obama, I mean, Bush, same thing, even Clinton.

23:32.560 --> 23:36.400
 Clinton was like fat, it looked miserable by like 2000.

23:36.400 --> 23:39.280
 HW, like, I mean, Reagan, famous, actually, yeah,

23:39.280 --> 23:41.040
 pretty much everybody I think about,

23:42.880 --> 23:44.080
 including John F. Kennedy,

23:44.080 --> 23:45.680
 who got much sicker while in office.

23:45.680 --> 23:49.280
 The job like weighs on you and makes you physically ill.

23:49.280 --> 23:53.080
 Trump was, he's the only person who just didn't happen to.

23:53.080 --> 23:57.000
 He almost gotten stronger and he was one of the most,

23:57.000 --> 24:00.240
 like the climate, there's so many people attacking him,

24:00.240 --> 24:03.160
 so much hatred, so much love and hatred.

24:03.160 --> 24:06.760
 And it was just, I mean, it was whatever it was,

24:06.760 --> 24:10.840
 it was quite masterful and a fascinating study.

24:10.840 --> 24:15.840
 If we stick on Hitler for just a minute,

24:15.920 --> 24:20.000
 what lessons do you take from that time?

24:20.000 --> 24:23.440
 Do you think it's a unique moment in human history,

24:23.440 --> 24:27.840
 that World War II, I mean, both Stalin and Hitler,

24:29.360 --> 24:33.840
 you know, is it something that's just an outlier

24:33.840 --> 24:36.440
 in all of human history in terms of the atrocities,

24:36.440 --> 24:40.800
 or is there lessons to be learned?

24:40.800 --> 24:45.280
 You mentioned offline that you're not just a student

24:45.280 --> 24:47.440
 of the entirety of the history, but you also are fascinated

24:47.440 --> 24:50.600
 by just different like policies and stuff.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.120
 Like, what's the immigration policy?

24:52.120 --> 24:53.520
 What's the policy on science?

24:53.520 --> 24:54.360
 And...

24:54.360 --> 24:55.640
 Third Reich in power, let me plug it,

24:55.640 --> 24:58.480
 by Richard Evans, I think is what it was.

24:58.480 --> 25:00.000
 Cause that actually will tell you,

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
 like what was it like to live under the Nazi regime

25:03.000 --> 25:04.080
 without the war?

25:05.360 --> 25:08.040
 Yeah, it's a hard question in terms of the lessons

25:08.040 --> 25:08.880
 that we can learn.

25:08.880 --> 25:11.800
 Cause there's a lot, and it's actually been over,

25:11.800 --> 25:13.720
 it's been over indexed almost.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.920
 Everything comes back to Hitler in a conversation.

25:15.920 --> 25:20.920
 So I kind of think of it within Mao, Stalin, and Hitler

25:21.120 --> 25:24.880
 as, I don't wanna say payments for,

25:24.880 --> 25:29.880
 but like the end point payment for the sins

25:30.680 --> 25:34.040
 and the problems of the monarchical system

25:34.040 --> 25:35.680
 that evolve within Europe.

25:35.680 --> 25:38.320
 Basically like 1400 and more.

25:38.320 --> 25:41.280
 I basically think that 1400,

25:41.280 --> 25:45.560
 the wars between France, England, the balance of power,

25:45.560 --> 25:49.400
 eventually World War I, and then serfdom within Russia,

25:49.400 --> 25:52.080
 the Russian revolution that birthed Stalin.

25:52.080 --> 25:55.040
 Same thing, the Kaiser and Imperial Germany

25:55.040 --> 25:58.440
 and this like incredibly crazy system of balance of power

25:58.440 --> 25:59.760
 in World War I.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.680
 And then same thing within China

26:01.680 --> 26:05.440
 in terms of the warring states and then the disintegration,

26:05.440 --> 26:08.480
 the European, you know, this is how they think of it.

26:08.480 --> 26:10.400
 Which is like the century of humiliation

26:10.400 --> 26:12.720
 and they had to have something like this.

26:12.720 --> 26:14.040
 I think of it, I try to think of it

26:14.040 --> 26:15.680
 within the context of that.

26:15.680 --> 26:19.080
 I don't wanna sound like an inevitablist,

26:19.080 --> 26:22.920
 but I think of it as, I like to think about systems,

26:22.920 --> 26:25.160
 especially here in DC, that's where I got into politics,

26:25.160 --> 26:29.400
 which is that you have to understand systems of power

26:29.400 --> 26:33.000
 and the incentives within systems and the disincentives,

26:33.000 --> 26:36.840
 the downside risk of what you're creating

26:36.840 --> 26:41.840
 because that is what leads and creates the behavior

26:42.080 --> 26:43.160
 within that system.

26:43.160 --> 26:45.880
 I was just talking to my girlfriend about this yesterday.

26:45.880 --> 26:47.920
 It's kind of funny, like I read these,

26:47.920 --> 26:50.920
 I'm obsessed with these books by Robert Caro,

26:50.920 --> 26:52.400
 the biographies of Lyndon Johnson.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.200
 He's written like 5,000 pages so far

26:54.200 --> 26:55.440
 and it's still not done.

26:55.440 --> 26:59.280
 Okay, so like these are like books I base my life on.

26:59.280 --> 27:02.640
 And look, these are Washington

27:02.640 --> 27:05.480
 and the story of the post New Deal era and forward.

27:05.480 --> 27:06.760
 Not much has changed.

27:06.760 --> 27:09.000
 Like the Senate is still the Senate.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.840
 So many of the same problems with the Senate

27:10.840 --> 27:13.280
 are still there in some cases.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.480
 No, not anymore.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.600
 But for a while, some of the people who were there

27:16.600 --> 27:18.800
 with Johnson are actually still,

27:18.800 --> 27:20.480
 one of them is the president of the United States,

27:20.480 --> 27:21.520
 just a joke.

27:21.520 --> 27:24.560
 And you think about also,

27:24.560 --> 27:26.320
 same with the media relationship, right?

27:26.320 --> 27:27.760
 Like there's this media really,

27:27.760 --> 27:29.260
 they may have come and gone.

27:29.260 --> 27:31.800
 Like the people who were in the media

27:31.800 --> 27:34.920
 and who were cozy with the administration officials,

27:34.920 --> 27:37.240
 I mean, they just recreated themselves.

27:37.240 --> 27:41.000
 It's like an ecosystem which doesn't change.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.240
 And that's why I'm like,

27:43.240 --> 27:46.160
 oh, it's not that was a specific time.

27:46.160 --> 27:47.400
 That's just DC.

27:47.400 --> 27:51.520
 Like that is DC because of the way

27:51.520 --> 27:53.000
 the system is architected.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.560
 It's pretty much been that way since like 1908,

27:55.560 --> 27:58.300
 whenever like Teddy Roosevelt was dining

27:58.300 --> 27:59.920
 with these journalists and he would yell at them.

27:59.920 --> 28:02.560
 And then he would go over to the society house.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.120
 And like in many ways,

28:04.120 --> 28:06.580
 that's now instead of going to Henry Adams's house,

28:06.580 --> 28:10.400
 like the people are congregating in Calorama,

28:10.400 --> 28:12.120
 which is the richest neighborhood here

28:12.120 --> 28:13.280
 at somebody else's house.

28:13.280 --> 28:14.920
 Like it's the same thing.

28:14.920 --> 28:16.520
 So you have to think about the system

28:16.520 --> 28:18.680
 and then the incentives within that system

28:18.680 --> 28:20.520
 about what the outcomes that they're producing.

28:20.520 --> 28:21.840
 If you actually wanna think about

28:21.840 --> 28:23.760
 how can I change this from the outside?

28:23.760 --> 28:25.680
 That's also why it's very difficult to change

28:25.680 --> 28:27.640
 because the system is designed

28:27.640 --> 28:31.020
 in order to produce actually pretty specific outcomes

28:31.020 --> 28:33.800
 that can only be changed in extraordinary times.

28:33.800 --> 28:37.300
 Yeah, and sometimes it's hard to predict

28:37.300 --> 28:41.260
 what kind of outcomes will result from the incentive,

28:41.260 --> 28:42.980
 the system that you create, right?

28:42.980 --> 28:44.420
 In the case, because especially

28:44.420 --> 28:46.180
 when it's novel kind of situations.

28:46.180 --> 28:49.260
 With Trump, he actually created a pretty novel situation.

28:49.260 --> 28:53.580
 And a lot of the things that we've seen

28:53.580 --> 28:56.380
 in the 20th century were very novel systems

28:56.380 --> 28:59.780
 where people were very optimistic about the outcomes, right?

28:59.780 --> 29:02.780
 And then it turned out to not have the results

29:02.780 --> 29:04.080
 that they predicted.

29:04.940 --> 29:06.620
 In terms of things being unchanged

29:06.620 --> 29:08.520
 for the past 100 years and so on,

29:08.520 --> 29:12.060
 can you like Wikipedia style

29:12.060 --> 29:14.700
 or maybe like in a musical form,

29:14.700 --> 29:17.100
 like I'm only a bill, describe to me.

29:17.100 --> 29:20.700
 I still sing that to my head sometimes.

29:20.700 --> 29:21.940
 I'm just a bill.

29:25.780 --> 29:27.180
 I don't know what the rest of the song is,

29:27.180 --> 29:30.860
 but let's leave that to people's imagination.

29:30.860 --> 29:33.020
 How does this whole thing work?

29:33.020 --> 29:35.020
 How does the US political system work?

29:35.020 --> 29:37.660
 The three branches is how do you think

29:37.660 --> 29:40.740
 about the system we have now?

29:40.740 --> 29:42.500
 If you were to try to describe,

29:42.500 --> 29:46.320
 if aliens showed up and asked you like,

29:46.320 --> 29:49.740
 they didn't have time, so this is an elevator thing.

29:49.740 --> 29:54.740
 Should we destroy you as you plead to avoid destruction?

29:55.580 --> 29:58.660
 Well, how would you describe how this thing works?

29:58.660 --> 30:02.060
 I would say we come together and we pick the people

30:02.060 --> 30:03.740
 who make our laws.

30:03.740 --> 30:07.900
 Then we pick the guy who executes those laws

30:07.900 --> 30:11.380
 and they together pick the people who determine

30:11.380 --> 30:14.900
 whether they or the president is breaking the law

30:14.900 --> 30:16.380
 at the most basic level.

30:16.380 --> 30:17.780
 That's how I would describe it.

30:20.140 --> 30:22.660
 So the people who make the laws are Congress.

30:22.660 --> 30:27.660
 The executive is charged with executing the laws

30:27.660 --> 30:29.240
 as passed by Congress, the system,

30:29.240 --> 30:30.280
 the branches of government,

30:30.280 --> 30:33.160
 and the Supreme Court is picked by the president,

30:33.160 --> 30:34.400
 confirmed by the Senate,

30:34.400 --> 30:38.200
 which then decides whether you or other people

30:38.200 --> 30:41.960
 are breaking the law in terms of interpretation of that law.

30:41.960 --> 30:42.800
 That's basically it.

30:42.800 --> 30:47.800
 Oh, and they decide whether those laws are in,

30:48.940 --> 30:53.940
 they fall within the restrictions

30:53.940 --> 30:58.820
 and the want of the founders as expressed

30:58.820 --> 31:00.780
 by the Constitution of the United States,

31:00.780 --> 31:05.780
 which is a set of principles that we came together in 1787.

31:06.040 --> 31:09.620
 I want to make sure I get this right, 1787,

31:09.620 --> 31:12.780
 and decided that we were going to live the rest of our lives

31:12.780 --> 31:14.700
 barring a revolution and more.

31:14.700 --> 31:16.860
 And we've made it 200 and something years

31:16.860 --> 31:18.620
 in order on under that system.

31:18.620 --> 31:20.380
 So there's a balance of power

31:20.380 --> 31:22.420
 that's because it's multiple branches.

31:22.420 --> 31:24.900
 There's a tension and a balance to it

31:24.900 --> 31:26.940
 as designed by those original documents.

31:28.260 --> 31:30.360
 What, which is the most dysfunctional,

31:30.360 --> 31:32.700
 the branches, which is your favorite?

31:32.700 --> 31:34.860
 Like in terms of talking about systems

31:34.860 --> 31:37.300
 and like what's the greatest of concern

31:37.300 --> 31:41.500
 and what is the greatest source of benefit in your view?

31:41.500 --> 31:42.740
 The presidency, obviously,

31:42.740 --> 31:46.440
 well, the presidency is my favorite to study, obviously,

31:46.440 --> 31:48.340
 because it is the one

31:48.340 --> 31:51.460
 where there's the most subjective variable change

31:51.460 --> 31:53.420
 in terms of the personality involved

31:53.420 --> 31:56.820
 because of so much power imbued within the executive.

31:56.820 --> 31:59.620
 The Senate is actually pretty much the same.

31:59.620 --> 32:02.060
 That's one of the things I love

32:02.060 --> 32:04.860
 about reading about the Senate and histories of the Senate

32:04.860 --> 32:06.240
 is you're like, oh yeah,

32:06.240 --> 32:08.700
 there were always like assholes in the Senate

32:08.700 --> 32:09.980
 who were doing their thing

32:09.980 --> 32:14.980
 and filibustering constantly based upon this or that.

32:15.300 --> 32:18.460
 And then the personalities involved with the Senate

32:18.460 --> 32:23.460
 haven't mattered as much since like pre civil war, right?

32:23.800 --> 32:25.940
 Like pre civil war, you had like Henry Clay

32:25.940 --> 32:29.940
 and then Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun,

32:29.940 --> 32:31.200
 who even in their own way,

32:31.200 --> 32:33.140
 they represented like larger constituencies

32:33.140 --> 32:35.300
 and they crafted these like compromises

32:35.300 --> 32:37.820
 up until the outbreak of the civil war, et cetera.

32:37.820 --> 32:39.100
 But like post since then,

32:39.100 --> 32:42.700
 you don't think about like the Titans within the Senate.

32:42.700 --> 32:44.600
 Most of that is because a lot of the stuff

32:44.600 --> 32:45.620
 that they had power over

32:45.620 --> 32:47.700
 has transferred over to the executive.

32:47.700 --> 32:51.040
 So I'm most interested in really in like power,

32:51.040 --> 32:52.020
 like where it lies.

32:52.020 --> 32:53.720
 It's actually pretty, you know,

32:53.720 --> 32:54.900
 throughout American history,

32:54.900 --> 32:56.940
 much more used to lie with Congress.

32:56.940 --> 33:00.420
 Now it's obviously just so imbued within the executive

33:00.420 --> 33:02.340
 that understanding executive power

33:02.340 --> 33:04.940
 is I think the thing I'm probably most interested in here.

33:04.940 --> 33:06.340
 Do you think at this point,

33:06.340 --> 33:09.340
 the amount of power that the president has is corrupting

33:09.340 --> 33:12.700
 to their ability to lead well?

33:12.700 --> 33:15.140
 Is this, you know, power corrupts,

33:15.140 --> 33:17.340
 absolute power corrupts, absolutely.

33:17.340 --> 33:21.500
 Are we, is there too much power in the presidency?

33:21.500 --> 33:22.540
 There definitely is.

33:22.540 --> 33:24.180
 And part of the problem,

33:24.180 --> 33:28.460
 one of the things I try to make come across to people is

33:28.460 --> 33:29.740
 if you're the president,

33:29.740 --> 33:34.020
 unless you have a hyper intentional view

33:34.020 --> 33:36.740
 of how something must be different in government,

33:36.740 --> 33:37.940
 your view doesn't matter.

33:37.940 --> 33:41.140
 So for example, like if you were Trump,

33:41.140 --> 33:42.100
 let's take Trump even,

33:42.100 --> 33:43.620
 and even in with a pretty intentional view,

33:43.620 --> 33:46.060
 he was like, I'm gonna end the war in Afghanistan

33:46.060 --> 33:47.260
 and Iraq, right?

33:47.260 --> 33:49.460
 And he came in and he gets these generals in.

33:49.460 --> 33:52.380
 He's like, I wanna end the war in Afghanistan and Iraq.

33:52.380 --> 33:54.740
 Oh, and I wanna withdraw these troops from Syria.

33:54.740 --> 33:56.300
 And they're like, okay, we'll give you,

33:56.300 --> 33:57.260
 give us like six months.

33:57.260 --> 33:58.100
 He's like, okay.

33:58.100 --> 33:58.940
 And this is the thing about Trump.

33:58.940 --> 34:00.580
 He doesn't realize that it's bullshit.

34:00.580 --> 34:01.420
 So they're like, he's like,

34:01.420 --> 34:03.460
 oh, six months seems fun, right?

34:03.460 --> 34:05.900
 So then six months comes and he's like,

34:05.900 --> 34:07.500
 he's like, so, and then he'll announce it.

34:07.500 --> 34:09.300
 He'll be like, and we're getting out of Syria.

34:09.300 --> 34:10.140
 It's great.

34:10.140 --> 34:11.660
 And then the generals freak out.

34:11.660 --> 34:12.700
 They're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:12.700 --> 34:13.620
 We don't have a plan for that.

34:13.620 --> 34:15.060
 He's like, but you guys told me six months.

34:15.060 --> 34:16.660
 He's like, I don't know, now we need another six months

34:16.660 --> 34:18.340
 in order to figure this thing out.

34:18.340 --> 34:19.980
 And by that time, now you're midterms.

34:19.980 --> 34:20.820
 So now what?

34:20.820 --> 34:22.100
 Now you gotta run for reelection.

34:22.100 --> 34:24.500
 So more what I mean by that is,

34:24.500 --> 34:25.980
 if you don't have a hyperintentional view

34:25.980 --> 34:27.500
 about how to change foreign policy,

34:27.500 --> 34:28.940
 if you don't have a hyperintentional view

34:28.940 --> 34:31.260
 about how the Department of Commerce should do its job,

34:31.260 --> 34:33.140
 they are just gonna go on autopilot.

34:33.140 --> 34:35.740
 So this is part of the problem.

34:35.740 --> 34:37.220
 When you asked me about the presidency,

34:37.220 --> 34:40.060
 it's not the presidency itself,

34:40.060 --> 34:43.060
 like the president himself, which has become too powerful.

34:43.060 --> 34:46.580
 It's that we have less democratic checks

34:46.580 --> 34:51.500
 on the people and the systems that are on autopilot.

34:51.500 --> 34:55.500
 And I would say that basically since 2008,

34:57.260 --> 35:01.780
 we have voted every single time to disrupt that system,

35:01.780 --> 35:04.260
 except in the case of 2020 with Joe Biden,

35:04.260 --> 35:05.380
 and there are a lot of different reasons

35:05.380 --> 35:06.940
 around why that happened.

35:06.940 --> 35:09.220
 And in every single one of those cases,

35:09.220 --> 35:11.420
 Obama and Trump, they all failed

35:11.420 --> 35:14.940
 in order to radically disrupt that.

35:14.940 --> 35:17.620
 And that just shows you how titanic the task is.

35:17.620 --> 35:19.860
 And I'm using my language precisely

35:19.860 --> 35:21.340
 because I don't wanna be like deep state,

35:21.340 --> 35:22.940
 but obviously there's deep state.

35:22.940 --> 35:26.060
 Deep state, I guess, has conspiratorial intentions to it.

35:26.060 --> 35:29.300
 But so what you're saying is the true power

35:29.300 --> 35:32.740
 currently lies with the autopilot, AKA deep state.

35:32.740 --> 35:36.500
 Well, but see, this is the thing too I wanna make clear,

35:36.500 --> 35:38.660
 because I think people think conspiratorially

35:38.660 --> 35:40.100
 that they're all coming together

35:40.100 --> 35:42.180
 to intentionally do something.

35:42.180 --> 35:43.220
 No, no, no, no.

35:43.220 --> 35:47.420
 They are doing what they know, believe they are right,

35:47.420 --> 35:50.700
 and don't have real democratic checks within that.

35:50.700 --> 35:53.420
 And so now they have entire generations of cultures

35:53.420 --> 35:55.900
 within each of these bureaucracies where they say,

35:55.900 --> 35:59.540
 this is the way that we do things around here.

35:59.540 --> 36:03.820
 And that's the problem, which is that we have a culture

36:03.820 --> 36:06.900
 of within many of these agencies and more.

36:06.900 --> 36:09.020
 I think the best example for this

36:09.020 --> 36:13.900
 would be during the Ukraine gate with Trump and all that,

36:13.900 --> 36:15.220
 with the impeachment.

36:15.220 --> 36:16.540
 I'm not talking about the politics here,

36:16.540 --> 36:18.980
 but the most revealing thing that happened

36:18.980 --> 36:21.940
 was when the whistleblower guy, Alexander Vindman,

36:21.940 --> 36:24.260
 was like, here you have the president

36:24.260 --> 36:27.060
 departing from the policy of the United States.

36:27.060 --> 36:32.060
 And I was like, well, let me educate you, Lieutenant Colonel.

36:32.300 --> 36:34.580
 The president of the United States

36:34.580 --> 36:36.420
 makes American foreign policy.

36:36.420 --> 36:38.260
 But it was a very revealing comment

36:38.260 --> 36:41.260
 because he and all the people

36:41.260 --> 36:44.040
 within national security bureaucracy do think that.

36:44.040 --> 36:46.620
 They're like, this is the policy of the United States.

36:46.620 --> 36:48.140
 We have to do this.

36:48.140 --> 36:49.460
 That's where things get screwy.

36:49.460 --> 36:51.060
 Well, listen, for me personally,

36:51.060 --> 36:53.180
 but also from an engineering perspective,

36:53.180 --> 36:54.740
 I just talked to Jim Keller.

36:54.740 --> 36:58.700
 It's just, this is the kind of bullshit that we all hate

36:58.700 --> 37:02.340
 when you're trying to innovate and design new products.

37:02.340 --> 37:05.860
 So that's what first principles thinking requires.

37:05.860 --> 37:09.020
 It's like, we don't give a shit what was done before.

37:09.020 --> 37:11.620
 The point is, what is the best way to do it?

37:11.620 --> 37:14.940
 And it seems like the current government,

37:14.940 --> 37:16.260
 government in general, probably,

37:16.260 --> 37:18.540
 bureaucracies in general,

37:18.540 --> 37:21.180
 are just really good at being lazy

37:21.180 --> 37:23.500
 without never having those conversations.

37:23.500 --> 37:26.480
 And just, it becomes this momentum thing

37:26.480 --> 37:29.020
 that nobody has the difficult conversations.

37:29.020 --> 37:32.460
 It's become a game within a certain set of constraints

37:32.460 --> 37:34.860
 and they never kind of do revolutionary tasks.

37:34.860 --> 37:37.900
 But you did say that the presidency is power,

37:37.900 --> 37:41.460
 but you're saying that more power than the others,

37:43.060 --> 37:44.720
 but that power has to be coupled

37:44.720 --> 37:46.600
 with focused intentionality.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.460
 You have to keep hammering the thing.

37:48.460 --> 37:51.040
 If you want it done, it has to be done.

37:51.040 --> 37:54.180
 I mean, and you gotta, this is the other part too,

37:54.180 --> 37:57.700
 which is that it's not just that you have to get it done.

37:57.700 --> 38:01.700
 You have to pick the 100 people who you can trust

38:01.700 --> 38:06.660
 to pick 10 people each to actually do what you want.

38:06.660 --> 38:08.780
 One of the most revealing quotes

38:08.780 --> 38:10.620
 is from a guy named Tommy Corcoran.

38:10.620 --> 38:12.980
 He was the top aide to FDR.

38:12.980 --> 38:14.860
 This I'm getting from the Kara books too.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.200
 And he said, what is a government?

38:17.200 --> 38:20.740
 It's not just one guy or even 10 guys.

38:20.740 --> 38:23.300
 Hell, it's a thousand guys.

38:23.300 --> 38:28.180
 And what FDR did is he masterfully picked the right people

38:28.180 --> 38:31.040
 to execute his will through the federal agencies.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.620
 Johnson was the same way.

38:32.620 --> 38:34.700
 He played these people like a fiddle.

38:34.700 --> 38:36.460
 He knew exactly who to pick.

38:36.460 --> 38:38.980
 He knew the system and more.

38:38.980 --> 38:40.740
 Part of the reason that outsiders

38:40.740 --> 38:43.220
 who don't have a lot of experience in Washington

38:43.220 --> 38:45.860
 almost always fail is they don't know who to pick

38:45.860 --> 38:49.140
 or they pick people who say one thing to their face.

38:49.140 --> 38:50.820
 And then when it comes time

38:50.820 --> 38:52.780
 to carry out the president's policy

38:52.780 --> 38:55.300
 in terms of the government, they just don't do it.

38:55.300 --> 38:57.200
 And the president's too, think about this.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.820
 I think some Rahm Emanuel said this.

38:58.820 --> 39:01.720
 He was like, by the time it gets to the president's desk,

39:01.720 --> 39:02.880
 nobody else can solve it.

39:02.880 --> 39:03.720
 It's not easy.

39:03.720 --> 39:05.620
 It's not like a yes or no question.

39:05.620 --> 39:08.740
 It's every single thing that hits the president's desk

39:08.740 --> 39:10.740
 is incredibly hard to do.

39:10.740 --> 39:12.780
 And Obama actually even said,

39:12.780 --> 39:14.020
 and this was a very revealing quote

39:14.020 --> 39:16.480
 about how he thinks about the presidency,

39:16.480 --> 39:19.100
 which is he's like, look, the presidency

39:19.100 --> 39:21.940
 is like one of those super tankers.

39:21.940 --> 39:26.080
 He's like, I can come in and I can take it two degrees left

39:26.080 --> 39:27.380
 and two degrees right.

39:27.380 --> 39:29.660
 In a hundred years, two degrees left,

39:29.660 --> 39:31.820
 that's a whole different trajectory.

39:31.820 --> 39:32.900
 Same thing on the right.

39:32.900 --> 39:36.940
 And he's like, that ultimately is really all you can do.

39:36.940 --> 39:38.720
 I quibble and disagree with that

39:38.720 --> 39:41.460
 in terms of how he could have changed things in 2008,

39:41.460 --> 39:43.620
 but there's a lot of truth to that statement.

39:43.620 --> 39:44.540
 Okay, that's really fascinating.

39:44.540 --> 39:48.740
 You make me realize that actually both Obama and Trump

39:48.740 --> 39:52.140
 are probably playing victim here to the system.

39:52.140 --> 39:55.780
 You're making me think that maybe you can correct me

39:55.780 --> 39:59.240
 that, cause I'm thinking of like Elon Musk,

39:59.240 --> 40:01.500
 whose major success despite everything

40:01.500 --> 40:03.380
 is hiring the right people.

40:03.380 --> 40:04.220
 Exactly.

40:04.220 --> 40:05.940
 And like creating those thousands,

40:05.940 --> 40:08.500
 that structure of a thousand people.

40:08.500 --> 40:11.220
 So maybe a president has power in that

40:11.220 --> 40:12.600
 if they were exceptionally good

40:12.600 --> 40:13.820
 at hiring the right people.

40:13.820 --> 40:15.220
 Personnel is policy, man.

40:15.220 --> 40:16.620
 That's what it comes down to.

40:16.620 --> 40:18.480
 But wouldn't you be able to steer the ship

40:18.480 --> 40:21.300
 way more than two degrees if you hire the right people?

40:21.300 --> 40:23.820
 So like, it's almost like Obama was not good

40:23.820 --> 40:25.220
 at hiring the right people.

40:25.220 --> 40:26.860
 Well, he hired all the Clinton people.

40:26.860 --> 40:27.700
 That's what happened.

40:27.700 --> 40:28.520
 What happened with Trump?

40:28.520 --> 40:29.500
 He hired all the Bush people.

40:29.500 --> 40:31.820
 And then you just sit back and say,

40:31.820 --> 40:33.780
 oh, president can't,

40:33.780 --> 40:36.300
 but that means you're just suck at hiring.

40:36.300 --> 40:37.140
 Correct.

40:37.140 --> 40:38.960
 Yeah, I mean, look, I know it's funny.

40:38.960 --> 40:40.640
 I'm giving you simultaneously

40:40.640 --> 40:42.840
 the nationalist case against Trump

40:42.840 --> 40:45.100
 and the progressive case against Obama.

40:45.100 --> 40:46.220
 The progressive people are like,

40:46.220 --> 40:48.960
 why the fuck are you hiring all these Clinton people

40:48.960 --> 40:51.860
 in order to run the government and just recreate,

40:51.860 --> 40:53.740
 like why are you hiring Larry Summers,

40:53.740 --> 40:56.280
 who was one of the people who worked at all these banks

40:56.280 --> 40:58.300
 and didn't believe that bailouts were gonna be big enough,

40:58.300 --> 41:01.160
 and then to come in in the worst economic crisis

41:01.160 --> 41:02.500
 in modern American history.

41:02.500 --> 41:03.660
 That was 2008.

41:03.660 --> 41:06.480
 And Summers actively lobbied against larger bailouts,

41:06.480 --> 41:09.900
 which had huge implications for working class people

41:09.900 --> 41:12.420
 and pretty much hollowed out America since.

41:12.420 --> 41:14.120
 Okay, from Trump, same thing.

41:14.120 --> 41:15.940
 You're like, I'm gonna drain the swamp.

41:15.940 --> 41:16.780
 And by doing that,

41:16.780 --> 41:20.580
 I'm gonna hire Goldman Sachs's Gary Cohn

41:20.580 --> 41:25.580
 and Steve Mnuchin and all these other absolute bush clowns

41:25.900 --> 41:27.680
 in order to run my White House.

41:27.680 --> 41:29.320
 Well, yeah, no shit.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.120
 The only thing that you accomplished

41:31.120 --> 41:32.740
 in your four years in office

41:32.740 --> 41:35.820
 is passing a massive tax cut for the rich

41:35.820 --> 41:37.300
 and for corporations.

41:37.300 --> 41:38.820
 I wonder how that happened.

41:38.820 --> 41:41.300
 What role does money play in all of this?

41:41.300 --> 41:43.600
 Is money a huge influence in politics,

41:44.620 --> 41:46.420
 super PACs, all that kind of stuff?

41:46.420 --> 41:50.220
 Or is this more just kind of a narrative that we play with

41:50.220 --> 41:52.060
 because from the outsider's perspective,

41:52.060 --> 41:53.540
 it seems to have,

41:53.540 --> 41:55.800
 that seems to be one of the fundamental problems

41:55.800 --> 41:56.820
 with modern politics.

41:56.820 --> 41:58.480
 So I was just having this conversation,

41:58.480 --> 41:59.320
 Marshall and I,

41:59.320 --> 42:01.180
 Marshall Kosloff, my cohost on The Realignment.

42:01.180 --> 42:04.520
 And it's funny because if you do enough research,

42:04.520 --> 42:08.320
 we actually live in the least corrupt age

42:08.320 --> 42:10.840
 in American campaign finance,

42:10.840 --> 42:13.660
 as in it's never been more transparent.

42:13.660 --> 42:18.300
 It's never been more up to the FEC and all of that.

42:18.300 --> 42:20.900
 If you go back and read not even 50 years ago,

42:20.900 --> 42:22.580
 we're talking about Lyndon B. Johnson,

42:22.580 --> 42:26.540
 handing people like literally as he came up in his youth,

42:26.540 --> 42:28.140
 paying people for votes,

42:28.140 --> 42:32.060
 like the boss of the person who like had

42:32.060 --> 42:33.220
 all the Mexican votes,

42:33.220 --> 42:34.100
 like the person who had,

42:34.100 --> 42:35.740
 and he was like giving out briefcases.

42:35.740 --> 42:37.540
 This is like within people's lifetimes

42:37.540 --> 42:38.940
 who are alive in America.

42:38.940 --> 42:40.460
 So that doesn't happen anymore.

42:40.460 --> 42:44.460
 But I don't like to blame everything on money.

42:44.460 --> 42:46.260
 Although I do think money is obviously

42:46.260 --> 42:47.420
 a huge part of the problem.

42:47.420 --> 42:51.780
 I actually look at it in terms of distribution,

42:51.780 --> 42:55.380
 which is that how is money distributed within our society?

42:55.380 --> 42:59.500
 Because I firmly believe that politics,

42:59.500 --> 43:00.740
 this is gonna get complicated,

43:00.740 --> 43:04.460
 but I think politics is mostly downstream from culture.

43:04.460 --> 43:06.820
 And culture, obviously I'm using economics

43:06.820 --> 43:08.340
 because there's obviously a huge interplay there,

43:08.340 --> 43:10.860
 but like in terms of the equitable

43:10.860 --> 43:12.680
 or lack of equitable distribution of money

43:12.680 --> 43:13.800
 within our politics,

43:13.800 --> 43:15.980
 what we're really pissed off about is we're like,

43:15.980 --> 43:18.100
 our politics only seems to work

43:18.100 --> 43:20.100
 for the people who have money.

43:20.100 --> 43:21.980
 I think that's largely true.

43:21.980 --> 43:24.600
 I think that the reason why things worked differently

43:24.600 --> 43:27.700
 in the past is because our economy was structured

43:27.700 --> 43:28.840
 in different ways.

43:28.840 --> 43:31.620
 And there's a reason that our politics today

43:31.620 --> 43:34.340
 are very analogous to the last Gilded Age

43:34.340 --> 43:37.340
 because we had very similar levels

43:37.340 --> 43:40.700
 of economic distribution and cultural problems too

43:40.700 --> 43:41.540
 at the same time.

43:41.540 --> 43:42.360
 I don't wanna erase that.

43:42.360 --> 43:43.600
 Cause I actually think that's what's driving

43:43.600 --> 43:44.980
 all of our politics right now.

43:44.980 --> 43:46.020
 So that's interesting.

43:47.380 --> 43:48.220
 So in that sense,

43:48.220 --> 43:50.260
 the representative government is doing a pretty good job

43:50.260 --> 43:52.260
 of representing the state of culture

43:52.260 --> 43:53.580
 and the people and so on.

43:53.580 --> 43:54.580
 Yeah.

43:54.580 --> 43:58.460
 Can I ask you in terms of the deep state

43:58.460 --> 43:59.860
 and conspiracy theories,

43:59.860 --> 44:02.020
 there's a lot of talk about,

44:02.020 --> 44:04.420
 again, from an outsider's perspective,

44:04.420 --> 44:06.380
 if I were just looking at Twitter,

44:06.380 --> 44:08.980
 it seems that at least 90% of people

44:08.980 --> 44:10.380
 in government are pedophiles.

44:10.380 --> 44:15.180
 90 to 95%, I'm not sure what that number is.

44:15.180 --> 44:17.940
 If I were to just look at Twitter, honestly, or YouTube,

44:17.940 --> 44:20.620
 I would think most of the world is a pedophile.

44:20.620 --> 44:22.060
 I would almost feel like.

44:22.060 --> 44:22.900
 Right.

44:22.900 --> 44:25.220
 And if you don't fully believe that, you're a pedophile.

44:25.220 --> 44:26.340
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:26.340 --> 44:28.220
 I would start to wonder like, wait,

44:28.220 --> 44:31.080
 like what, am I a pedophile too?

44:31.080 --> 44:34.060
 I'm either a communist or a pedophile or both, I guess.

44:35.060 --> 44:36.300
 Yeah, that's gonna be clipped out.

44:36.300 --> 44:37.420
 Thank you, internet.

44:37.420 --> 44:39.420
 Yeah.

44:39.420 --> 44:42.180
 I look forward to your emails.

44:42.180 --> 44:47.180
 But is there any kind of shadow conspiracy theories

44:47.880 --> 44:51.860
 that give you pause or,

44:51.860 --> 44:52.820
 so the flip side,

44:52.820 --> 44:55.860
 the response to a lot of conspiracy theories is like,

44:55.860 --> 44:57.460
 no, the reason this happened

44:57.460 --> 45:01.820
 is because it's a combination of just incompetence.

45:01.820 --> 45:06.400
 So where do you land on some of these conspiracy theories?

45:06.400 --> 45:09.100
 I think most conspiracy theories are wrong.

45:09.100 --> 45:12.940
 Some are true and those are spectacularly true.

45:12.940 --> 45:14.580
 And if that makes sense.

45:14.580 --> 45:15.820
 Yeah.

45:15.820 --> 45:16.740
 And we don't know which ones.

45:16.740 --> 45:17.660
 I don't know which ones.

45:17.660 --> 45:18.580
 That's the problem.

45:18.580 --> 45:21.540
 I think, well, I mean, look, man, I listened to your podcast.

45:21.540 --> 45:25.500
 I think I was a huge nonbeliever in UFOs

45:25.500 --> 45:28.300
 and now I've probably never believed more in UFOs.

45:28.300 --> 45:30.820
 Like I believe in UFOs.

45:30.820 --> 45:32.780
 Like I'm very comfortable being like,

45:32.780 --> 45:34.280
 not only do I believe in UFOs,

45:34.280 --> 45:35.700
 like I think we're probably being visited

45:35.700 --> 45:37.580
 by an alien civilization.

45:37.580 --> 45:39.500
 And if you asked me that three years ago,

45:39.500 --> 45:40.940
 I would have been like, you're out of your fucking mind.

45:40.940 --> 45:42.180
 Like, what are you talking about?

45:42.180 --> 45:43.980
 Well, listen to David Fravor.

45:43.980 --> 45:44.860
 That's all I have to say.

45:44.860 --> 45:45.700
 That's it.

45:45.700 --> 45:49.100
 I have the sense that the government has information

45:49.100 --> 45:50.660
 that hasn't revealed,

45:50.660 --> 45:52.100
 but it's not like they're,

45:52.100 --> 45:53.700
 I don't think they're holding,

45:53.700 --> 45:56.580
 there's like a green guy sitting there in a room.

45:56.580 --> 45:59.740
 They have seen things they don't know what to do with.

45:59.740 --> 46:01.380
 So it's like, they're confused.

46:01.380 --> 46:04.380
 They're afraid of revealing that they don't know.

46:04.380 --> 46:05.900
 That's what I think it is, right?

46:05.900 --> 46:09.100
 It's revealing, yeah, exactly, that they don't know.

46:09.100 --> 46:10.700
 And then in the process,

46:10.700 --> 46:12.340
 there's a lot of fears tied up in that.

46:12.340 --> 46:15.180
 First, looking incompetent in the public eye.

46:15.180 --> 46:17.700
 Nobody wants to be looked that way.

46:17.700 --> 46:20.340
 And the other is like, in revealing it,

46:20.340 --> 46:22.020
 even though they don't know,

46:22.020 --> 46:23.300
 maybe China will figure it out.

46:23.300 --> 46:24.140
 Exactly.

46:24.140 --> 46:26.660
 So like, we don't want China to figure it out first.

46:26.660 --> 46:28.980
 And so all those kinds of things

46:28.980 --> 46:30.580
 result in basically secrecy.

46:30.580 --> 46:33.340
 Then that damages the trust in institutions

46:33.340 --> 46:36.780
 on one of the most fascinating aspects,

46:36.780 --> 46:39.980
 like one of the most fascinating mysteries of humankind

46:39.980 --> 46:43.340
 of is there life, intelligent life,

46:43.340 --> 46:44.780
 out there in the universe?

46:44.780 --> 46:45.660
 So that's one of them.

46:45.660 --> 46:48.660
 But there's other ones, like for me,

46:48.660 --> 46:53.660
 when I first came across actually Alex Jones was 9 11.

46:53.660 --> 46:57.780
 I remember like, cause I was in Chicago.

46:57.780 --> 46:59.220
 I was thinking like, oh shit,

46:59.220 --> 47:01.460
 are they gonna hit Chicago too?

47:01.460 --> 47:02.340
 That's what everybody was thinking.

47:02.340 --> 47:03.180
 Yeah, everybody.

47:03.180 --> 47:05.060
 Everybody was thinking like, what does this mean?

47:05.060 --> 47:05.900
 What scale?

47:05.900 --> 47:07.620
 What, I mean, trying to interpret it.

47:07.620 --> 47:10.620
 And I remember like looking for information desperately,

47:10.620 --> 47:12.340
 like what happened?

47:12.340 --> 47:14.420
 And I remember not being satisfied

47:14.420 --> 47:17.100
 with the quality of reporting

47:17.100 --> 47:18.780
 and figuring out like rigorous,

47:18.780 --> 47:21.420
 like here's exactly what happened.

47:21.420 --> 47:23.620
 And so people like Alex Jones stepped up

47:23.620 --> 47:25.900
 and others that said like,

47:25.900 --> 47:27.900
 there's some shady shit going on.

47:27.900 --> 47:29.580
 And it sure as hell looked like

47:29.580 --> 47:30.860
 there's shady shit going on.

47:30.860 --> 47:31.820
 Yes.

47:31.820 --> 47:34.740
 So like, and I still stand behind the fact

47:34.740 --> 47:36.780
 that it seems like there's not,

47:36.780 --> 47:39.700
 there's not enough, like it wasn't a good job

47:39.700 --> 47:41.220
 of being honest and transparent

47:41.220 --> 47:42.060
 and all those kinds of things.

47:42.060 --> 47:43.340
 Cause it would implicate the Saudis.

47:43.340 --> 47:44.180
 Let's be honest.

47:44.180 --> 47:46.180
 And see, that's my conspiracy theories.

47:46.180 --> 47:48.140
 I'm like, yeah, I think they covered up a lot of stuff

47:48.140 --> 47:49.500
 because they wanted to cover up

47:49.500 --> 47:50.780
 for the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

47:50.780 --> 47:53.460
 Like, I mean, that was a conspiracy theory

47:53.460 --> 47:54.420
 not that long ago.

47:54.420 --> 47:55.300
 I think it's true.

47:55.300 --> 47:57.140
 I mean, I think it's a hundred percent true.

47:57.140 --> 47:59.940
 Yeah, so those kinds of conspiracy theories are interesting.

47:59.940 --> 48:01.740
 I mean, there's other ones for me personally

48:01.740 --> 48:06.100
 that touched the institution that means a lot to me

48:06.100 --> 48:09.700
 is the MIT and, you know, Jeffrey Epstein.

48:09.700 --> 48:10.660
 Yeah, I wanna hear a lot more.

48:10.660 --> 48:12.780
 I wanna hear about, I talk about Epstein a lot.

48:12.780 --> 48:13.660
 So I'm like. Oh, you do?

48:13.660 --> 48:15.700
 Yeah, and he, I was gonna say,

48:15.700 --> 48:17.020
 in terms of conspiracy theory,

48:17.020 --> 48:18.780
 that one changed my outlook.

48:18.780 --> 48:20.860
 Cause I was like, I was like, whoa,

48:20.860 --> 48:24.180
 like you have this dude who convinced

48:24.180 --> 48:26.620
 some of the most successful people on earth

48:26.620 --> 48:29.100
 that he was like some money manager.

48:29.100 --> 48:31.140
 And it looks like it was totally fake.

48:31.140 --> 48:32.260
 Like Leon Black.

48:32.260 --> 48:34.300
 I mean, this is one of the richest men on wall street,

48:34.300 --> 48:36.700
 $9 billion net worth.

48:36.700 --> 48:40.100
 Why is he giving him over a hundred million dollars

48:40.100 --> 48:42.460
 between 2015 and 2019?

48:42.460 --> 48:43.840
 What's going on here?

48:43.840 --> 48:45.300
 Lex Wexner, same thing.

48:45.300 --> 48:46.300
 So yeah, I wanna hear,

48:46.300 --> 48:48.520
 because you know people who met him.

48:48.520 --> 48:50.820
 And the only person I know who met him was Eric Weinstein.

48:50.820 --> 48:52.160
 I've heard his, right.

48:52.160 --> 48:53.000
 Oh boy.

48:53.000 --> 48:56.620
 So I, listen, I'm still in and Eric is fascinating

48:56.620 --> 48:59.780
 and like Eric is full on saying that.

48:59.780 --> 49:01.700
 He was a Mossad or whatever.

49:01.700 --> 49:04.180
 Yeah, there's a front for something,

49:04.180 --> 49:06.020
 something much, much bigger.

49:06.920 --> 49:09.740
 And there's a, whatever his name, Robert Maxwell,

49:09.740 --> 49:12.140
 all the, all those stories,

49:12.140 --> 49:14.100
 like you could dig deeper and deeper

49:14.100 --> 49:17.580
 that Jeffrey's just like the tip of the iceberg.

49:17.580 --> 49:20.700
 I just think he's an exceptionally charismatic,

49:20.700 --> 49:22.820
 listen, this isn't speaking from confidence

49:22.820 --> 49:25.780
 or like deep understanding of the situation,

49:25.780 --> 49:28.420
 but from my speaking with people,

49:28.420 --> 49:33.420
 he just seems like, at least from the side of his influence

49:34.140 --> 49:36.820
 and interaction with researchers,

49:36.820 --> 49:38.340
 he just seems like somebody

49:38.340 --> 49:40.020
 that was exceptionally charismatic

49:41.700 --> 49:44.780
 and actually took interest.

49:44.780 --> 49:49.780
 He was unable to speak about interesting scientific things,

49:49.780 --> 49:51.940
 but he took interest in them.

49:51.940 --> 49:53.940
 So he knew how to stroke the egos

49:53.940 --> 49:56.260
 of a lot of powerful people, like well,

49:56.260 --> 49:58.500
 like in different kinds of ways,

49:58.500 --> 50:01.220
 I suppose I don't know about this

50:01.220 --> 50:04.180
 because I don't have, like if a really,

50:04.180 --> 50:06.020
 okay, this is weird to say,

50:06.020 --> 50:09.660
 but I have an ability,

50:09.660 --> 50:12.740
 okay, I think women are beautiful, I like women,

50:12.740 --> 50:16.300
 but like if like a supermodel came to me or something,

50:16.300 --> 50:19.300
 like I'm able to reason.

50:19.300 --> 50:22.700
 It seems like some people are not able to think clearly

50:22.700 --> 50:25.260
 when there's like an attractive woman in the room.

50:25.260 --> 50:28.300
 And I think that was one of the tools he used

50:28.300 --> 50:29.380
 to manipulate people.

50:29.380 --> 50:30.300
 Interesting.

50:30.300 --> 50:33.620
 I don't know, listen, it's like the pedophile thing.

50:33.620 --> 50:35.900
 I don't know how many people are complete sex addicts,

50:35.900 --> 50:39.700
 but like, it seems like looking out into the world,

50:39.700 --> 50:42.260
 like the Me Too movement have revealed

50:42.260 --> 50:44.700
 that there's a lot of like weird,

50:44.700 --> 50:47.220
 like creepy people out there.

50:47.220 --> 50:50.500
 I don't know, but I think it was just one of the many tools

50:50.500 --> 50:55.500
 that he used to convince people and manipulate people,

50:56.380 --> 51:01.380
 but not in some like evil way,

51:02.140 --> 51:07.020
 but more just really good at the art of conversation

51:07.020 --> 51:09.820
 and just winning people over on the side.

51:10.860 --> 51:13.660
 And then by building through that process,

51:13.660 --> 51:16.100
 building a network of other really powerful people

51:16.100 --> 51:21.100
 and not explicitly, but implicitly having done shady shit

51:22.700 --> 51:26.300
 with powerful people, like building up

51:26.300 --> 51:31.300
 a kind of implied power of like,

51:31.580 --> 51:34.660
 like we did some shady shit together.

51:34.660 --> 51:37.700
 So we're not like, you're gonna help me out

51:37.700 --> 51:39.580
 on this extra thing I need to do now.

51:39.580 --> 51:41.940
 And that builds and builds and builds

51:41.940 --> 51:44.660
 to where you're able to actually control,

51:44.660 --> 51:48.060
 like have quite a lot of power without explicitly having

51:48.060 --> 51:50.100
 like a strategy meeting.

51:50.100 --> 51:54.060
 And I think a single person or yeah,

51:54.060 --> 51:55.900
 I think a single person can do that,

51:55.900 --> 51:58.100
 can start that ball rolling.

51:58.100 --> 52:00.580
 And over time it becomes a group thing,

52:00.580 --> 52:03.660
 like I don't know if Jillian Maxwell was involved

52:03.660 --> 52:07.980
 or others and yeah, over time that becomes almost

52:07.980 --> 52:09.860
 like a really powerful organization

52:09.860 --> 52:14.500
 that wasn't, that's not a front for something much deeper

52:14.500 --> 52:17.060
 and bigger, but it's almost like maybe it's

52:17.060 --> 52:19.500
 cause I love cellular automata, man.

52:19.500 --> 52:22.100
 A system that starts out as a simple thing

52:22.100 --> 52:25.340
 with simple rules can create incredible complexity.

52:25.340 --> 52:29.500
 And so I just think that we're now looking in retrospect,

52:29.500 --> 52:31.700
 it looks like an incredibly complex system

52:31.700 --> 52:35.020
 that's operating, but like, that's just because it's,

52:35.020 --> 52:37.260
 there could be a lot of other Jeffrey Epstein's

52:37.260 --> 52:41.740
 in my perspective that the simple thing just was successful

52:41.740 --> 52:44.300
 early on and builds and builds and builds and builds

52:44.300 --> 52:47.780
 and then there's a creepy shit that like a lot of aspects

52:47.780 --> 52:50.900
 of the system helped it get bigger and bigger

52:50.900 --> 52:52.420
 and more powerful and so on.

52:52.420 --> 52:56.260
 So the final result is, I mean, listen,

52:56.260 --> 53:00.540
 I have a pretty optimistic, I tend to see the good

53:00.540 --> 53:04.180
 in people and so it's been heartbreaking to me in general

53:04.180 --> 53:09.180
 just to see people I look up to not have the level

53:09.620 --> 53:11.980
 of integrity I thought they would

53:11.980 --> 53:15.260
 or like the strength of character, all those kinds of things.

53:15.260 --> 53:20.260
 And it seems like you should be able to see the bullshit

53:20.420 --> 53:22.860
 that is Jeffrey Epstein, like when you meet him.

53:23.820 --> 53:25.740
 We're not talking about like Eric Weinstein,

53:25.740 --> 53:28.620
 like one or two or three or five interactions,

53:28.620 --> 53:31.780
 but like there's people that had like years

53:31.780 --> 53:33.620
 of relationship with him.

53:33.620 --> 53:35.740
 And I don't know, I'm not sure.

53:35.740 --> 53:36.860
 Even after he was convicted.

53:36.860 --> 53:38.100
 After he was convicted.

53:38.100 --> 53:39.660
 That guy always gets me.

53:39.660 --> 53:42.660
 Yeah, there's stories, I mean, I don't need to sort of,

53:44.460 --> 53:49.460
 I honestly believe, okay, here's the open question I have.

53:52.140 --> 53:55.700
 I don't know how many creepy sexual people

53:55.700 --> 53:57.060
 that are out there.

53:57.060 --> 54:00.140
 Like, I don't know if there is like,

54:00.140 --> 54:03.380
 like the people I know, the faculty and so on,

54:03.380 --> 54:05.260
 I don't know if they have like a kink

54:05.260 --> 54:08.260
 that I'm just not aware of that was being leveraged

54:08.260 --> 54:13.260
 because to me, it seems like if not everybody's a pedophile,

54:16.300 --> 54:18.580
 then it's just the art of conversation.

54:18.580 --> 54:21.940
 That is just like the art of just like manipulating people

54:21.940 --> 54:23.820
 by making them feel good

54:23.820 --> 54:25.500
 about like the exciting stuff they're doing.

54:25.500 --> 54:28.540
 Listen, man, academics, people talk about money.

54:28.540 --> 54:30.380
 I don't think academics care about money

54:30.380 --> 54:31.540
 as much as people think.

54:31.540 --> 54:34.700
 What they care about is like somebody,

54:34.700 --> 54:37.820
 they want to be, it's the same thing

54:37.820 --> 54:41.020
 that Instagram models posting their butt pictures,

54:41.020 --> 54:42.660
 is they want to be loved.

54:42.660 --> 54:43.780
 They want attention.

54:43.780 --> 54:44.740
 My parents are professors.

54:44.740 --> 54:45.580
 Yeah, I get it.

54:45.580 --> 54:47.060
 Yeah.

54:47.060 --> 54:49.220
 They, and Jeff Epstein,

54:49.220 --> 54:52.380
 like the money is another way to show attention.

54:52.380 --> 54:54.180
 Right, it's a proxy.

54:54.180 --> 54:55.500
 My work matters.

54:55.500 --> 55:00.500
 And he did that for some of the weirdest,

55:00.740 --> 55:02.660
 most brilliant people.

55:02.660 --> 55:06.140
 I don't want to sort of drop names, but everybody knows them.

55:06.140 --> 55:09.860
 It's like people that are the most interesting academics

55:09.860 --> 55:11.420
 is the one he cared about.

55:11.420 --> 55:15.140
 Like people are thinking about the most difficult questions

55:15.140 --> 55:16.900
 in all of science and all of engineering.

55:16.900 --> 55:21.100
 So those people are, were kind of outcasts in academia

55:21.100 --> 55:23.180
 a little bit because they're doing the weird shit.

55:23.180 --> 55:24.460
 They're the weirdos.

55:24.460 --> 55:26.980
 And he cared about the weirdos and he gave them money.

55:26.980 --> 55:30.860
 And that, you know, that's,

55:30.860 --> 55:33.980
 I don't know if there's something more nefarious than that.

55:33.980 --> 55:36.620
 I hope not, but maybe I'm surprised.

55:36.620 --> 55:39.620
 And in fact, half the population of the world is pedophiles.

55:39.620 --> 55:41.340
 No, I think it's what you were talking about,

55:41.340 --> 55:44.220
 which is that it's the,

55:44.220 --> 55:46.780
 it's the implication after the initial, right?

55:46.780 --> 55:48.740
 Like you do some shady things together

55:48.740 --> 55:51.220
 or you do something that you want out of the public eye

55:51.220 --> 55:52.420
 and you're a public person.

55:52.420 --> 55:54.300
 And look, we probably even experienced this

55:54.300 --> 55:55.420
 to a limited extent, right?

55:55.420 --> 55:57.580
 You're like, ah, you know, like, I don't want to,

55:57.580 --> 55:59.340
 I don't know, I almost lost my temper, you know,

55:59.340 --> 56:00.880
 one time whenever a car hit me and I'm like,

56:00.880 --> 56:02.420
 I can't freak out in public anymore.

56:02.420 --> 56:04.580
 Like, you know, like what if somebody takes a photo

56:04.580 --> 56:05.420
 or something?

56:05.420 --> 56:08.260
 And so I think that there's an extent to that

56:08.260 --> 56:10.020
 times a billion, literally,

56:10.020 --> 56:12.220
 when you have a billion dollars or more.

56:12.220 --> 56:13.380
 And you take that all together

56:13.380 --> 56:15.020
 and you stack it up on itself.

56:15.020 --> 56:16.840
 I saw a story about like Bill Clinton.

56:16.840 --> 56:20.340
 Like Bill Clinton was with Epstein or with Ghislaine Maxwell

56:20.340 --> 56:23.020
 in a private air terminal or something.

56:23.020 --> 56:26.460
 And she had one of their like sex, you know,

56:26.460 --> 56:28.140
 one of those girls who was underage,

56:28.140 --> 56:31.140
 had her dressed up in a literal like pilot uniform.

56:31.140 --> 56:33.980
 And she was underage in order to, you know,

56:33.980 --> 56:37.540
 and she was being disguised for being older.

56:37.540 --> 56:39.040
 And she was a masseuse, right?

56:39.040 --> 56:41.620
 Because that was one of the guises which they got

56:41.620 --> 56:43.580
 in order to sexually traffic these women.

56:43.580 --> 56:45.700
 And she was like, Bill was like complaining about his neck.

56:45.700 --> 56:47.740
 And she's like, give Bill Clinton a massage, right?

56:47.740 --> 56:49.420
 So now there's a photo of an underage girl

56:49.420 --> 56:51.340
 giving a massage to the former president

56:51.340 --> 56:52.740
 of the United States.

56:52.740 --> 56:54.640
 I don't think he knew, right?

56:54.640 --> 56:56.680
 But like, that looks bad.

56:56.680 --> 56:59.060
 And so this is kind of what we're getting at,

56:59.060 --> 57:01.020
 which is that you're setting it all up

57:01.020 --> 57:04.100
 and creating those preconditions or like Prince Andrew.

57:04.100 --> 57:05.460
 Do I think Prince Andrew knew

57:05.460 --> 57:08.800
 that Virginia Gouffre was underage?

57:08.800 --> 57:10.060
 I don't know.

57:10.060 --> 57:11.500
 Probably knew she was pretty young,

57:11.500 --> 57:13.100
 which I think is, you know, skeevy enough

57:13.100 --> 57:15.860
 where you're a fucking Prince, you probably know better.

57:15.860 --> 57:18.780
 But I don't think he knew she was underage

57:18.780 --> 57:19.600
 or maybe he did.

57:19.600 --> 57:21.260
 And if he did, then he's even more of a piece of shit

57:21.260 --> 57:22.100
 than I thought.

57:22.100 --> 57:25.620
 But when we look at these things,

57:25.620 --> 57:27.460
 the stuff I'm more interested in is like

57:27.460 --> 57:28.420
 what you were talking about.

57:28.420 --> 57:31.420
 I'm like, Bill Gates, how do you get the richest man

57:31.420 --> 57:33.060
 in the world in your house?

57:33.060 --> 57:35.540
 Like under what, and Gates is like,

57:35.540 --> 57:37.140
 he was talking about financing and all this.

57:37.140 --> 57:40.260
 I'm like, you don't have access to money or bankers?

57:40.260 --> 57:42.740
 Like you're the richest man in the world.

57:42.740 --> 57:46.300
 You can call Goldman Sachs anytime you want on a hotline.

57:46.300 --> 57:49.660
 Like, why do you need, that's where I start again

57:49.660 --> 57:51.700
 to get more conspiratorial because I'm like,

57:51.700 --> 57:54.980
 Bill, dude, you have the gold credit, right?

57:54.980 --> 57:56.660
 Like you don't need Epstein to create

57:56.660 --> 57:59.340
 some complicated financing structure.

57:59.340 --> 58:04.340
 Or Leon Black, like what is 2015, 2009?

58:04.340 --> 58:06.020
 I mean, this is very recent stuff.

58:06.020 --> 58:08.060
 Or, and this is the part that really got me

58:08.060 --> 58:09.740
 as I read the department,

58:09.740 --> 58:11.540
 I think it's called the Department of Financial Service

58:11.540 --> 58:15.580
 report around Deutsche Bank with Epstein.

58:15.580 --> 58:16.900
 They knew he was a criminal.

58:16.900 --> 58:18.620
 They solicited his business,

58:18.620 --> 58:22.100
 explicitly knew that his business meant access

58:22.100 --> 58:24.620
 to other high net worth individuals,

58:24.620 --> 58:27.100
 consistently doled money out from his account

58:27.100 --> 58:31.260
 for hush payments to women in Europe and prostitution rings.

58:31.260 --> 58:33.580
 They knew all of this within the bank.

58:33.580 --> 58:35.580
 It was elevated multiple times.

58:35.580 --> 58:36.620
 Here was the other one.

58:36.620 --> 58:38.260
 One of Epstein's associates was like,

58:38.260 --> 58:40.100
 hey, how much money can we take out

58:40.100 --> 58:42.580
 before we hit the automatic sensor

58:42.580 --> 58:44.820
 before you have to tell the IRS?

58:44.820 --> 58:47.980
 And that question by their own standards

58:47.980 --> 58:51.380
 is supposed to result in a notification to the feds

58:51.380 --> 58:52.340
 and they never did it.

58:52.340 --> 58:54.900
 And he was withdrawing like $2 million of cash

58:54.900 --> 58:58.660
 in five years for tips to, I'm like, okay,

58:58.660 --> 59:00.380
 like something's going on here.

59:00.380 --> 59:01.700
 Like, you see what I'm saying?

59:01.700 --> 59:03.780
 There's a lot of signs that make you think

59:03.780 --> 59:08.100
 that there's a bigger thing at play than just the man,

59:08.100 --> 59:12.940
 that there's some, it does look like a larger organization

59:12.940 --> 59:15.220
 is using this front, right?

59:15.220 --> 59:16.060
 Again, I don't know.

59:16.060 --> 59:17.380
 I truly don't know.

59:17.380 --> 59:19.100
 And I'm not willing to use the certainty,

59:19.100 --> 59:20.580
 which I think a lot of people online are,

59:20.580 --> 59:22.380
 to say like, it wants 100%.

59:22.380 --> 59:23.820
 The certainty is always the problem

59:23.820 --> 59:26.820
 because that's probably why I hesitate

59:26.820 --> 59:28.500
 to touch conspiracy theories

59:28.500 --> 59:31.620
 is because I'm allergic to certainty in all forms.

59:31.620 --> 59:33.380
 In politics, any kind of discourse.

59:33.380 --> 59:37.820
 And people are so sure, in both directions, actually,

59:37.820 --> 59:39.860
 it's kind of hilarious.

59:39.860 --> 59:43.380
 Either they're sure that the conspiracy theory,

59:43.380 --> 59:45.860
 particularly whatever the conspiracy theory is, is false.

59:45.860 --> 59:47.780
 Like they almost dismiss it like,

59:47.780 --> 59:50.860
 like they don't even want to talk about it.

59:50.860 --> 59:51.740
 It's like the people,

59:51.740 --> 59:54.420
 like the way they dismiss that the earth is flat.

59:54.420 --> 59:56.300
 Most scientists are like,

59:56.300 --> 59:59.780
 they don't even want to like hear

59:59.780 --> 1:00:02.300
 what the flat earthers are saying.

1:00:02.300 --> 1:00:05.140
 They don't have like zero patience for it,

1:00:05.140 --> 1:00:09.340
 which is like, maybe in that case is deserved.

1:00:09.340 --> 1:00:14.020
 But everything else, you really like have empathy.

1:00:14.020 --> 1:00:16.260
 Like consider the fact, you have,

1:00:16.260 --> 1:00:18.140
 okay, this is weird to say,

1:00:18.140 --> 1:00:22.140
 but I feel like you have to consider

1:00:22.140 --> 1:00:26.140
 that the earth may be flat for like one minute.

1:00:26.140 --> 1:00:27.700
 Like you have to be empathetic.

1:00:27.700 --> 1:00:29.380
 You have to be open minded.

1:00:29.380 --> 1:00:30.260
 I don't see a lot of that

1:00:30.260 --> 1:00:32.220
 through our cultural taste makers and more.

1:00:32.220 --> 1:00:35.540
 And that really is what concerns me the most.

1:00:35.540 --> 1:00:37.020
 Cause it's just another manifestation

1:00:37.020 --> 1:00:38.140
 of all of our problems.

1:00:38.140 --> 1:00:41.980
 Is that we have this completely bifurcating economy,

1:00:41.980 --> 1:00:44.100
 bifurcating culture, literally,

1:00:44.100 --> 1:00:46.860
 in terms of we have the middle of the country

1:00:46.860 --> 1:00:47.940
 and then we have the coast.

1:00:47.940 --> 1:00:51.340
 And in terms of the population, it's almost 50, 50.

1:00:51.340 --> 1:00:55.220
 And with increasing mega cities and urban culture,

1:00:55.220 --> 1:00:58.820
 like urban monoculture of LA, New York and Chicago

1:00:58.820 --> 1:01:01.380
 and DC and Boston and Austin,

1:01:01.380 --> 1:01:04.100
 relative to how an entire other group

1:01:04.100 --> 1:01:05.980
 of Americans live their lives,

1:01:05.980 --> 1:01:07.380
 or even the people within them

1:01:07.380 --> 1:01:09.140
 who aren't rich and upwardly mobile,

1:01:09.140 --> 1:01:12.060
 how they live their lives is just completely separating.

1:01:12.060 --> 1:01:14.820
 And all of our language and communication

1:01:14.820 --> 1:01:16.940
 in mass media and more is to the top.

1:01:16.940 --> 1:01:18.660
 And then everybody else is forgotten.

1:01:18.660 --> 1:01:21.460
 Do you think when you dig to the core,

1:01:21.460 --> 1:01:25.500
 there is a big gap between left and right?

1:01:25.500 --> 1:01:30.020
 Is that division that's perceived currently real

1:01:30.020 --> 1:01:33.420
 or are most people center left and center right?

1:01:33.420 --> 1:01:34.260
 It's so interesting

1:01:34.260 --> 1:01:37.940
 because that's such a loaded term, center left.

1:01:37.940 --> 1:01:39.060
 What does that mean?

1:01:39.060 --> 1:01:42.900
 Like to you, I think the way you're thinking of it is,

1:01:42.900 --> 1:01:46.140
 I'm not like a, well, even this,

1:01:46.140 --> 1:01:49.260
 like I'm not a radical socialist,

1:01:49.260 --> 1:01:54.260
 but I'm marginally left on cultural issues

1:01:54.660 --> 1:01:56.500
 and economic issues.

1:01:56.500 --> 1:01:59.100
 This is how we've traditionally understood things.

1:01:59.100 --> 1:02:02.020
 And then in popular discourse, like center right,

1:02:02.020 --> 1:02:03.300
 like what does it mean to be center right?

1:02:03.300 --> 1:02:08.300
 Like I am marginally right on social issues

1:02:08.300 --> 1:02:10.780
 and marginally right on economic issues.

1:02:10.780 --> 1:02:14.500
 But that's just not, like if you look at survey data,

1:02:14.500 --> 1:02:18.180
 for example, like stimulus checks,

1:02:18.180 --> 1:02:20.700
 people who are against stimulus checks are conservative.

1:02:20.700 --> 1:02:23.660
 Well, 80% of the population is for a stimulus check.

1:02:23.660 --> 1:02:26.180
 So that means a sizable number of Republicans

1:02:26.180 --> 1:02:27.540
 are for stimulus checks.

1:02:27.540 --> 1:02:29.900
 Same thing happens on like a wealth tax.

1:02:30.780 --> 1:02:35.260
 The same thing happens on, okay, Florida voted for Trump,

1:02:35.260 --> 1:02:39.460
 3.1%, more than Barack Obama, 2008,

1:02:39.460 --> 1:02:44.020
 on the same day passes a $15 minimum wage at 67%.

1:02:44.020 --> 1:02:45.240
 So what's going on?

1:02:45.240 --> 1:02:46.080
 So that's why I.

1:02:46.080 --> 1:02:47.780
 What is going on?

1:02:47.780 --> 1:02:50.420
 Oh, that's my entire career.

1:02:50.420 --> 1:02:53.620
 But it seems like, so that's fascinating.

1:02:53.620 --> 1:02:57.700
 Conversation is different than the policies.

1:02:57.700 --> 1:02:59.140
 Well, it's different than reality.

1:02:59.140 --> 1:02:59.980
 That's what I would say,

1:02:59.980 --> 1:03:02.260
 which is that the way we have to understand

1:03:02.260 --> 1:03:05.460
 American politics today, it didn't always

1:03:05.460 --> 1:03:09.540
 used to be this way, is it's almost entirely long.

1:03:09.540 --> 1:03:12.780
 Basic, I would say the main divider is,

1:03:12.780 --> 1:03:14.140
 because even when you talk about class,

1:03:14.140 --> 1:03:16.480
 this misses it in terms of socioeconomics,

1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:20.980
 it's around culture, which is that it's basically,

1:03:20.980 --> 1:03:24.200
 if you went to a four year degree granting institution,

1:03:24.200 --> 1:03:25.900
 you are part of one culture.

1:03:25.900 --> 1:03:27.900
 If you didn't, you're part of another.

1:03:27.900 --> 1:03:31.140
 I don't wanna erase the 20% or whatever of people

1:03:31.140 --> 1:03:33.540
 who did go to a college degree who are Republicans

1:03:33.540 --> 1:03:37.060
 or vice versa, et cetera, but I'm saying on average,

1:03:37.060 --> 1:03:39.880
 in terms of the median way that you feel,

1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:43.060
 we're basically bifurcating along those lines.

1:03:43.060 --> 1:03:44.660
 And because people get upset, be like,

1:03:44.660 --> 1:03:47.280
 oh, well, there are rich people who vote for Trump.

1:03:47.280 --> 1:03:50.500
 And I'm like, yeah, but you know who they are?

1:03:50.500 --> 1:03:52.700
 They're like plumbers or something.

1:03:52.700 --> 1:03:55.120
 They're people who make $100,000 a year,

1:03:55.120 --> 1:03:57.140
 but they didn't go to a four year college degree

1:03:57.140 --> 1:04:00.380
 and they might live who are in a place

1:04:00.380 --> 1:04:02.420
 which is not an urban metro area.

1:04:02.420 --> 1:04:05.700
 And then at the same time, you have like a Vox writer

1:04:05.700 --> 1:04:08.020
 who makes like 30 grand,

1:04:08.020 --> 1:04:10.380
 but they have a lot more cultural power

1:04:10.380 --> 1:04:11.700
 than like the plumber.

1:04:11.700 --> 1:04:15.100
 So you have to think about where exactly that line is.

1:04:15.100 --> 1:04:18.460
 And I think in general, that's the way that we're trending.

1:04:18.460 --> 1:04:21.220
 So that's why when I say like, what's going on,

1:04:21.220 --> 1:04:22.060
 are we divided?

1:04:22.060 --> 1:04:24.520
 Yeah, like, but it's not left and right.

1:04:24.520 --> 1:04:26.740
 I mean, like, and that's why I hate these labels.

1:04:26.740 --> 1:04:29.340
 So it's more just red and blue like teams.

1:04:29.340 --> 1:04:31.620
 They're arbitrary teams.

1:04:31.620 --> 1:04:33.660
 So how arbitrary are these teams,

1:04:33.660 --> 1:04:34.500
 I guess is another.

1:04:34.500 --> 1:04:35.700
 Completely arbitrary.

1:04:35.700 --> 1:04:37.780
 So, well, you kind of imply that there's,

1:04:37.780 --> 1:04:41.580
 I don't know if you're sort of in post analyzing the patterns

1:04:41.580 --> 1:04:45.220
 because it seems like there's a network effects

1:04:45.220 --> 1:04:47.500
 of like, you just pick the team red or blue

1:04:48.420 --> 1:04:50.240
 and it might have to do with college.

1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:51.620
 You might have to do all of those things,

1:04:51.620 --> 1:04:54.780
 but like, it seems like it's more about

1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:58.160
 just the people around you.

1:04:58.160 --> 1:04:59.000
 Correct.

1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:01.940
 So less than whether you went to college or not.

1:05:01.940 --> 1:05:04.100
 I mean, it's almost like, seems like,

1:05:04.100 --> 1:05:08.380
 it's almost like a weird, like network effects that are hard.

1:05:08.380 --> 1:05:11.540
 There's certain strong patterns you're identifying,

1:05:11.540 --> 1:05:13.120
 but I don't know.

1:05:13.120 --> 1:05:15.860
 It's sad to think that it might be just teams

1:05:15.860 --> 1:05:18.780
 that have nothing to do with what you actually believe.

1:05:18.780 --> 1:05:20.060
 Well, it is, Lex.

1:05:20.060 --> 1:05:22.740
 Look, I mean, I don't want to believe that,

1:05:22.740 --> 1:05:25.860
 but the data points me to this, which especially 2020,

1:05:25.860 --> 1:05:28.080
 I'm one of the people chief among them.

1:05:28.080 --> 1:05:29.380
 I will own up to it here.

1:05:29.380 --> 1:05:33.140
 I was totally wrong about why Trump was elected in 2016.

1:05:33.140 --> 1:05:36.780
 I believed and based a lot of my public commentary beliefs

1:05:36.780 --> 1:05:40.020
 on this, Trump was elected because of a rejection

1:05:40.020 --> 1:05:43.380
 of Hillary Clinton neoliberalism on the back

1:05:43.380 --> 1:05:48.380
 of a pro worker message, which was anti immigration.

1:05:48.500 --> 1:05:51.880
 It was its pillar, but alongside of it was a rejection

1:05:51.880 --> 1:05:56.060
 of free trade with China and generally

1:05:56.060 --> 1:05:58.820
 of the political correctness and globalism,

1:05:58.820 --> 1:06:02.300
 which has been come in through the uniparty

1:06:02.300 --> 1:06:05.580
 and same thing here with the military industrial complex

1:06:05.580 --> 1:06:08.580
 and endless war, he rejected all of that.

1:06:08.580 --> 1:06:10.460
 Wait, what's wrong with that prediction?

1:06:10.460 --> 1:06:11.300
 It's wrong, man.

1:06:11.300 --> 1:06:14.180
 And the reason I know this is that it sounds right.

1:06:14.180 --> 1:06:16.740
 I wish it, I honestly wish it was true,

1:06:16.740 --> 1:06:17.780
 but here's the truth.

1:06:17.780 --> 1:06:22.480
 Trump actually governed largely as a neoliberal Republican

1:06:22.480 --> 1:06:26.580
 who was meaner online and who departed from orthodoxy

1:06:26.580 --> 1:06:27.940
 in some very important ways.

1:06:27.940 --> 1:06:28.780
 Don't get me wrong.

1:06:28.780 --> 1:06:31.380
 I will always support the trade war with China.

1:06:31.380 --> 1:06:33.900
 I will always support not expanding the wars

1:06:33.900 --> 1:06:35.580
 in Afghanistan and in Iraq.

1:06:35.580 --> 1:06:38.260
 I will support him moving the Overton window

1:06:38.260 --> 1:06:40.660
 on a million different things and revealing once

1:06:40.660 --> 1:06:42.780
 and for all that GOP voters don't care

1:06:42.780 --> 1:06:45.620
 about economic orthodoxy necessarily.

1:06:45.620 --> 1:06:47.440
 But here's what they do care about.

1:06:47.440 --> 1:06:50.940
 Trump got more votes in 2020 than he did in 2016,

1:06:50.940 --> 1:06:54.900
 despite not delivering largely for all the Trump people

1:06:54.900 --> 1:06:56.740
 out there on that agenda.

1:06:56.740 --> 1:06:59.740
 He wasn't more pro union, but he won more union votes.

1:06:59.740 --> 1:07:02.560
 He wasn't necessarily more pro worker,

1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:07.020
 but he actually won more votes in Ohio than he did in 2016.

1:07:07.020 --> 1:07:10.840
 And he won more Hispanic votes than despite being

1:07:10.840 --> 1:07:13.840
 all the immigration rhetoric, et cetera.

1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:16.200
 Here's why, it's about the culture,

1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:19.460
 which is that the culture war is so hot

1:07:19.460 --> 1:07:22.940
 that negative partisanship is at such high levels.

1:07:22.940 --> 1:07:26.040
 All of the vote is geared upon what the other guy

1:07:26.040 --> 1:07:26.960
 might do in office.

1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:28.460
 And there's a poll actually just came out

1:07:28.460 --> 1:07:29.700
 by Echelon Insights.

1:07:29.700 --> 1:07:31.760
 Crystal and I were talking about it on Rising,

1:07:31.760 --> 1:07:34.900
 that number one concern amongst Democratic voters

1:07:34.900 --> 1:07:37.780
 is Trump voters, number one concern.

1:07:37.780 --> 1:07:41.340
 Not issues like Trump voters.

1:07:41.340 --> 1:07:43.380
 And number two is white supremacy.

1:07:43.380 --> 1:07:47.060
 And so like, which is basically code for Trump voters.

1:07:47.060 --> 1:07:48.940
 And is the same true for the other side?

1:07:48.940 --> 1:07:50.940
 Also on the right, the number one concern

1:07:50.940 --> 1:07:52.380
 is illegal immigration.

1:07:52.380 --> 1:07:56.780
 And number, I think, three or four or whatever is Antifa,

1:07:56.780 --> 1:07:58.620
 which is code for Democrats.

1:07:58.620 --> 1:08:00.860
 At least on the right is a policy kind of thing.

1:08:00.860 --> 1:08:01.980
 Well, yeah, it's funny.

1:08:01.980 --> 1:08:03.800
 I saw Ben Shapiro was talking about this.

1:08:03.800 --> 1:08:06.720
 But the reason why I would functionally say it's the same

1:08:06.720 --> 1:08:10.260
 is because, I mean, you can believe whether it's true or not.

1:08:10.260 --> 1:08:11.400
 I think it actually largely is true.

1:08:11.400 --> 1:08:15.060
 But a lot of GOP voters feel like a lot of illegal

1:08:15.060 --> 1:08:17.540
 immigration is code for people who are coming in,

1:08:17.540 --> 1:08:19.860
 who are gonna be legalized and are gonna go vote Democrat.

1:08:19.860 --> 1:08:22.740
 Like, I can just explain it from their point of view.

1:08:22.740 --> 1:08:25.220
 So like, what does that actually mean?

1:08:25.220 --> 1:08:27.300
 Each other, like each other,

1:08:27.300 --> 1:08:30.820
 which is that the number one concern is the other person.

1:08:30.820 --> 1:08:33.580
 So negative partisanship has never been higher.

1:08:33.580 --> 1:08:36.260
 And I think people who had my thesis

1:08:36.260 --> 1:08:38.880
 in terms of why Trump was elected in 2016,

1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:39.780
 you have to grapple with this.

1:08:39.780 --> 1:08:43.080
 Like, how did he win 10 million more votes?

1:08:43.080 --> 1:08:45.640
 He came 44,000 votes away from winning the presidency

1:08:45.640 --> 1:08:46.860
 across three states.

1:08:46.860 --> 1:08:50.220
 Like, I don't, none of our popular discourse reflects

1:08:50.220 --> 1:08:51.860
 that very stark reality.

1:08:51.860 --> 1:08:56.860
 And I think so much of it is people really hate liberals.

1:08:57.980 --> 1:08:59.740
 Like, they just really hate them.

1:08:59.740 --> 1:09:04.060
 And I was driving through rural Nevada before the election.

1:09:04.060 --> 1:09:06.380
 And I was like, literally in the middle of nowhere.

1:09:06.380 --> 1:09:08.540
 And there was this massive sign

1:09:08.540 --> 1:09:10.660
 this guy had out in front of his house.

1:09:10.660 --> 1:09:14.380
 And it just said, Trump, colon, fuck your feelings.

1:09:14.380 --> 1:09:16.240
 And I was like, that's it.

1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:18.620
 That is why people voted for Trump.

1:09:18.620 --> 1:09:21.500
 And I don't want to denigrate it because they truly feel

1:09:21.500 --> 1:09:24.500
 they have no cultural power in America,

1:09:24.500 --> 1:09:28.440
 except to raise the middle finger to the elite class

1:09:28.440 --> 1:09:30.540
 by pressing the button for Trump.

1:09:30.540 --> 1:09:31.380
 I get that.

1:09:31.380 --> 1:09:35.020
 That's actually a totally rational way to vote.

1:09:35.020 --> 1:09:37.060
 It's not the way I wish we did vote,

1:09:37.060 --> 1:09:40.140
 but like, you know, that's not my place to say.

1:09:40.140 --> 1:09:41.500
 So this is interesting.

1:09:41.500 --> 1:09:43.260
 If you could just psychoanalyze,

1:09:43.260 --> 1:09:46.620
 I'm again, probably naive about this,

1:09:46.620 --> 1:09:51.620
 but I'm really bothered by the hatred of liberals.

1:09:52.580 --> 1:09:57.580
 It's this amorphous monster that's mocked.

1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:00.980
 It's like the Shapiro liberal tears.

1:10:00.980 --> 1:10:03.180
 And I'm also really bothered by

1:10:05.100 --> 1:10:07.860
 probably more of my colleagues and friends,

1:10:07.860 --> 1:10:09.420
 the hatred of Trump.

1:10:09.420 --> 1:10:14.420
 Yeah, the Trump and white supremacists.

1:10:15.300 --> 1:10:19.580
 So apparently there's 70 million white supremacists,

1:10:19.580 --> 1:10:21.340
 75 million, sorry.

1:10:21.340 --> 1:10:25.260
 There's millions of white supremacists.

1:10:25.260 --> 1:10:27.600
 And apparently whatever liberal is,

1:10:27.600 --> 1:10:31.860
 I mean, literally liberal has become

1:10:31.860 --> 1:10:33.620
 equivalent to white supremacists

1:10:33.620 --> 1:10:36.620
 in the power of negativity it arouses.

1:10:36.620 --> 1:10:38.020
 I don't even know what those,

1:10:38.020 --> 1:10:41.040
 I mean, honestly, they've become swears essentially.

1:10:42.060 --> 1:10:46.180
 Is that, I mean, how do we get out of this?

1:10:46.180 --> 1:10:49.860
 Because that's why I just don't even say anything

1:10:49.860 --> 1:10:50.960
 about politics online.

1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:53.260
 Cause it's like, really?

1:10:53.260 --> 1:10:57.880
 Like you can't, here's what happens.

1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:01.100
 Anything you say that's like thoughtful,

1:11:01.100 --> 1:11:05.300
 like, hmm, I wonder, immigration, something.

1:11:05.300 --> 1:11:10.300
 I wonder like why we have these many,

1:11:11.540 --> 1:11:13.220
 we allow these many immigrants in

1:11:13.220 --> 1:11:16.140
 or some version of the like thinking through

1:11:16.140 --> 1:11:18.460
 these difficult policies and so on.

1:11:18.460 --> 1:11:22.020
 They immediately tried to find like a single word

1:11:22.020 --> 1:11:24.820
 in something you say that can put you in a bin

1:11:24.820 --> 1:11:28.060
 of liberal or white supremacists

1:11:28.060 --> 1:11:30.180
 and then hammer you to death

1:11:30.180 --> 1:11:32.340
 by saying you're one of the two.

1:11:32.340 --> 1:11:35.000
 And then everybody just piles on happily

1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:39.260
 that we finally nailed this white supremacist or liberal.

1:11:39.260 --> 1:11:42.540
 And that, is this some kind of weird

1:11:42.540 --> 1:11:44.500
 like feature of online communication

1:11:44.500 --> 1:11:45.920
 that we've just stumbled upon?

1:11:45.920 --> 1:11:48.700
 Is there a way or is it possible to argue

1:11:48.700 --> 1:11:51.020
 that this is like a feature, not a bug?

1:11:51.020 --> 1:11:53.360
 Like, this is a good thing?

1:11:53.360 --> 1:11:55.340
 Yeah, well, look, I just think it's a reflection

1:11:55.340 --> 1:11:56.180
 of who we are.

1:11:56.180 --> 1:11:57.500
 People like to blame social media.

1:11:57.500 --> 1:11:59.220
 I think we're just incredibly divided right now.

1:11:59.220 --> 1:12:02.140
 I think we've been divided like this for the last 20 years.

1:12:02.140 --> 1:12:06.140
 And I think that, the reason I focus almost 99%

1:12:06.140 --> 1:12:08.300
 of my public commentary on economics

1:12:08.300 --> 1:12:10.860
 is because you asked an important question at the top.

1:12:10.860 --> 1:12:12.780
 How do we fix this?

1:12:12.780 --> 1:12:14.820
 What did I say about the stimulus checks?

1:12:14.820 --> 1:12:16.980
 Stimulus checks have 80% approval rating.

1:12:16.980 --> 1:12:18.140
 So that's the type of thing.

1:12:18.140 --> 1:12:20.060
 If I was Joe Biden and I wanted to actually

1:12:20.060 --> 1:12:22.020
 heal this country, that's the very first thing

1:12:22.020 --> 1:12:23.860
 I would have done when I came into office.

1:12:23.860 --> 1:12:26.820
 Same thing on when you look at anything

1:12:26.820 --> 1:12:28.940
 that's gonna increase wages.

1:12:28.940 --> 1:12:30.940
 I said on the show, I was like, look,

1:12:30.940 --> 1:12:32.980
 I think Joe Biden will have an 80% approval rating

1:12:32.980 --> 1:12:34.180
 if he does two things.

1:12:34.180 --> 1:12:37.580
 If he gives every American a $2,000 stimulus check

1:12:37.580 --> 1:12:40.080
 and gives everybody who wants a vaccine a vaccine.

1:12:40.080 --> 1:12:40.920
 That's it.

1:12:40.920 --> 1:12:41.740
 It's pretty simple.

1:12:41.740 --> 1:12:43.620
 Cause here's the thing.

1:12:43.620 --> 1:12:45.100
 I don't really like Greg Abbott that much.

1:12:45.100 --> 1:12:46.420
 We have like very different politics.

1:12:46.420 --> 1:12:49.180
 I'm from Texas, but my parents got vaccinated

1:12:49.180 --> 1:12:50.280
 really quickly.

1:12:50.280 --> 1:12:51.620
 That means something to me.

1:12:51.620 --> 1:12:54.180
 I'm like, listen, I don't really care

1:12:54.180 --> 1:12:55.780
 about a lot of the other stuff.

1:12:55.780 --> 1:12:58.200
 He got my family vaccinated.

1:12:58.200 --> 1:13:02.380
 Like that, well, I will forever remember that.

1:13:02.380 --> 1:13:04.940
 And that's how we will remember the checks.

1:13:04.940 --> 1:13:06.580
 This is a part of a reason why Trump

1:13:06.580 --> 1:13:08.380
 almost won the election and why,

1:13:08.380 --> 1:13:10.380
 if the Republicans had been smart enough

1:13:10.380 --> 1:13:13.260
 to give him another round of checks,

1:13:13.260 --> 1:13:14.740
 100% would have won.

1:13:14.740 --> 1:13:17.100
 Which is that people were like, look,

1:13:17.100 --> 1:13:19.520
 I don't really like Trump, but I got a check

1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:20.760
 with his name on it.

1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:24.260
 And that meant something to me and my family.

1:13:24.260 --> 1:13:26.900
 I'm not saying for all the libertarians out there

1:13:26.900 --> 1:13:29.780
 that they should go and like endlessly spend money

1:13:29.780 --> 1:13:31.020
 and buy votes.

1:13:31.020 --> 1:13:36.020
 What I am saying is lean into the majoritarian positions

1:13:36.500 --> 1:13:40.040
 without adding your culture war bullshit on top of it.

1:13:40.040 --> 1:13:42.660
 So for example, what's the number one concern

1:13:42.660 --> 1:13:45.340
 that AOC says after the first round of checks got out?

1:13:45.340 --> 1:13:47.460
 Oh, the checks didn't go to illegal immigrants.

1:13:47.460 --> 1:13:49.640
 I'm like, are you out of your fucking mind?

1:13:49.640 --> 1:13:51.860
 Like this is the most popular policy America

1:13:51.860 --> 1:13:55.220
 has probably done in 50 years,

1:13:55.220 --> 1:14:00.220
 since like Medicare and you're ruining it.

1:14:00.220 --> 1:14:02.020
 And then on the right is the same thing,

1:14:02.020 --> 1:14:03.540
 which is that they'll be like,

1:14:03.540 --> 1:14:05.940
 these checks are going to like, you know,

1:14:05.940 --> 1:14:07.980
 low level blah, blah, you know,

1:14:07.980 --> 1:14:10.020
 people who are lazy and don't work.

1:14:10.020 --> 1:14:11.140
 I'm like, oh, there you go, you know,

1:14:11.140 --> 1:14:14.340
 like you're just playing a caricature of what you are.

1:14:14.340 --> 1:14:16.340
 Like if you lean into those issues

1:14:16.340 --> 1:14:17.700
 and you got to do it clean,

1:14:17.700 --> 1:14:19.620
 this is what everybody hates about DC,

1:14:19.620 --> 1:14:23.260
 which is that Biden right now is doing the $1,400 checks,

1:14:23.260 --> 1:14:26.140
 but he's looping it in with his COVID relief bill

1:14:26.140 --> 1:14:26.980
 and all that.

1:14:26.980 --> 1:14:28.740
 That's his prerogative, that's the Democrats prerogative.

1:14:28.740 --> 1:14:30.460
 They won the election, that's fine.

1:14:30.460 --> 1:14:33.180
 But I'll tell you what I would have done if I was him,

1:14:33.180 --> 1:14:34.900
 I would have come in and I would have said,

1:14:34.900 --> 1:14:36.340
 there's five United States senators

1:14:36.340 --> 1:14:37.860
 who are on the record, Republicans,

1:14:37.860 --> 1:14:39.860
 who said they'll vote for a $2,000 check.

1:14:39.860 --> 1:14:42.820
 And I would put that on the floor of the United States Senate

1:14:42.820 --> 1:14:46.220
 on my, you know, first or the first day possible.

1:14:46.220 --> 1:14:47.300
 And I would have passed it

1:14:47.300 --> 1:14:49.620
 and I would have forced those Republican senators

1:14:49.620 --> 1:14:52.260
 to live up to that, vote for this bill,

1:14:52.260 --> 1:14:54.740
 come to the Oval Office for a signing

1:14:54.740 --> 1:14:57.300
 so that the very first thing of my presidency

1:14:57.300 --> 1:15:00.700
 was to say, I'm giving you all this relief check,

1:15:00.700 --> 1:15:03.060
 this long national nightmare is over.

1:15:03.060 --> 1:15:05.340
 Take this money, do with it what you need.

1:15:05.340 --> 1:15:07.460
 We've all suffered together.

1:15:07.460 --> 1:15:10.580
 The thing about Biden is he has a portrait of FDR

1:15:10.580 --> 1:15:13.100
 and is in the Oval, which kind of bothers me

1:15:13.100 --> 1:15:16.020
 because he thinks of himself as an FDR like figure.

1:15:16.020 --> 1:15:20.040
 But this is, you have to understand the majesty of FDR.

1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:21.300
 We're talking about a person

1:15:21.300 --> 1:15:23.180
 who passed a piece of legislation

1:15:23.180 --> 1:15:25.340
 five days after he became president.

1:15:25.340 --> 1:15:29.220
 And he passed 15 transformative pieces of legislation

1:15:29.220 --> 1:15:30.860
 in the first 100 days.

1:15:30.860 --> 1:15:35.460
 We're on day like 34, 35, and nothing has passed.

1:15:35.460 --> 1:15:37.660
 The reconciliation bill will eventually become law,

1:15:37.660 --> 1:15:40.100
 but it will become law with no Republican votes.

1:15:40.100 --> 1:15:41.420
 And again, that's fine.

1:15:42.340 --> 1:15:44.900
 But it's not fulfilling that legacy

1:15:44.900 --> 1:15:47.240
 and the urgency of the action.

1:15:47.240 --> 1:15:50.340
 And the mandate, which I believe that history has handed,

1:15:50.340 --> 1:15:52.980
 it handed it to Trump and he fucked it up, right?

1:15:52.980 --> 1:15:54.040
 He totally screwed it up.

1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:55.340
 He could have remade America

1:15:55.340 --> 1:15:57.420
 and made us into the greatest country ever

1:15:57.420 --> 1:15:58.900
 coming out on the other side of this.

1:15:58.900 --> 1:16:01.020
 He decided not to do that.

1:16:01.020 --> 1:16:04.100
 I think Biden was again handed that like a scepter almost.

1:16:04.100 --> 1:16:05.020
 It's like all you have to do,

1:16:05.020 --> 1:16:07.780
 all America wants is for you to raise it up high,

1:16:07.780 --> 1:16:10.540
 but he's keeping it within the realm of traditional politics.

1:16:10.540 --> 1:16:11.620
 I think it's a huge mistake.

1:16:11.620 --> 1:16:13.540
 Why, so this is, everything he's saying

1:16:13.540 --> 1:16:16.280
 is makes perfect sense, like take, okay.

1:16:16.280 --> 1:16:19.420
 It's like, it's like, again, if the aliens showed up,

1:16:19.420 --> 1:16:22.500
 it's like the obvious thing to do is like,

1:16:22.500 --> 1:16:25.100
 what's the popular thing?

1:16:25.100 --> 1:16:28.140
 Like 80% of Americans support this.

1:16:28.140 --> 1:16:30.500
 Like do that clean.

1:16:31.860 --> 1:16:36.380
 Also do it like with like grace,

1:16:36.380 --> 1:16:38.620
 where you're able to bring people together,

1:16:38.620 --> 1:16:40.740
 not like in a political way,

1:16:40.740 --> 1:16:44.620
 but like obvious common sense way.

1:16:44.620 --> 1:16:48.580
 Like just people, the Republicans and Democrats

1:16:48.580 --> 1:16:50.900
 just bring them together on a policy and like bold,

1:16:50.900 --> 1:16:54.240
 just hammer it without the dirt, without the mess,

1:16:54.240 --> 1:16:56.440
 whatever, try to compromise.

1:16:56.440 --> 1:17:00.020
 Just the yellow have a good Twitter account,

1:17:00.020 --> 1:17:03.300
 like loud, very clear.

1:17:03.300 --> 1:17:06.740
 We're gonna give a $2,000 or a stimulus check.

1:17:06.740 --> 1:17:11.060
 Anyone who wants a vaccine gets a vaccine at scale.

1:17:11.060 --> 1:17:14.980
 What make America, let's make America great again

1:17:14.980 --> 1:17:16.620
 by manufacturing.

1:17:16.620 --> 1:17:20.300
 Like we are manufacturing most of the world's vaccine

1:17:20.300 --> 1:17:22.180
 because we're bad motherfuckers.

1:17:22.180 --> 1:17:26.100
 And without maybe with more eloquence than that

1:17:26.100 --> 1:17:27.780
 and just do that.

1:17:27.780 --> 1:17:32.780
 Why haven't we seen that for many, for several presidencies?

1:17:32.780 --> 1:17:34.580
 Because of coalitional politics

1:17:34.580 --> 1:17:36.700
 and they owe something to somebody else.

1:17:36.700 --> 1:17:40.100
 For example, Biden has got a lot

1:17:40.100 --> 1:17:42.900
 of the Democratic constituency has to satisfy

1:17:42.900 --> 1:17:44.520
 within this bill.

1:17:44.520 --> 1:17:47.040
 So there's gonna be a lot of shit that goes in there,

1:17:47.040 --> 1:17:49.220
 state and local aid, all this stuff.

1:17:49.220 --> 1:17:50.540
 Again, I'm not even saying this is bad,

1:17:50.540 --> 1:17:53.900
 but he's like, his theory is, and this isn't wrong,

1:17:53.900 --> 1:17:56.540
 is like we're gonna take the really popular stuff

1:17:56.540 --> 1:18:00.380
 and use it as cover for the more downwardly less popular.

1:18:00.380 --> 1:18:03.580
 And so the Dems could face the accusation,

1:18:03.580 --> 1:18:05.300
 the people who are on this side,

1:18:05.300 --> 1:18:06.220
 this is their pushback to me.

1:18:06.220 --> 1:18:08.940
 They're like, why would we give away the most popular thing

1:18:08.940 --> 1:18:10.920
 in the bill and then we would never be able

1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:13.200
 to pass state and local aid, right?

1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:15.660
 Why would we do, and the Republicans do the same thing,

1:18:15.660 --> 1:18:18.700
 right, like Mitch McConnell, because he's a fucking idiot,

1:18:18.700 --> 1:18:21.740
 decided to say, we're gonna pair these $2,000 stimulus checks

1:18:21.740 --> 1:18:24.020
 with like section 230 repeal.

1:18:24.020 --> 1:18:26.020
 And it was like, oh, it's obviously dead, right?

1:18:26.020 --> 1:18:28.220
 Like it's not gonna happen together.

1:18:28.220 --> 1:18:31.060
 That's largely why I believe Trump lost the election

1:18:31.060 --> 1:18:33.220
 and why those races down in Georgia

1:18:33.220 --> 1:18:34.160
 went the way that they did.

1:18:34.160 --> 1:18:36.860
 Obviously Trump had something to do with it,

1:18:36.860 --> 1:18:39.980
 but the reason why is they have longstanding things

1:18:39.980 --> 1:18:41.160
 that they've wanted to get done.

1:18:41.160 --> 1:18:43.940
 And in the words of Rahm Emanuel, never let a good crisis

1:18:43.940 --> 1:18:47.420
 go to waste and try and get as much as you possibly can done

1:18:47.420 --> 1:18:48.940
 within a single bill.

1:18:48.940 --> 1:18:51.700
 My counter would be this,

1:18:51.700 --> 1:18:53.660
 things have worked this way for too long,

1:18:53.660 --> 1:18:55.820
 which is that the reconciliation bill

1:18:55.820 --> 1:18:59.180
 is almost certainly going to be the only large

1:18:59.180 --> 1:19:02.260
 signature legislative accomplishment

1:19:02.260 --> 1:19:03.680
 of the Biden presidency.

1:19:03.680 --> 1:19:05.380
 That's just how American politics works.

1:19:05.380 --> 1:19:07.900
 Maybe he gets one more, maybe one.

1:19:07.900 --> 1:19:09.980
 He has a second reconciliation bill,

1:19:09.980 --> 1:19:12.860
 then you're running for midterms, it's over.

1:19:12.860 --> 1:19:16.180
 I believe that by trying to change the paradigm

1:19:16.180 --> 1:19:19.820
 of our politics, leaning into exactly what I'm talking here,

1:19:19.820 --> 1:19:23.340
 you could possibly transcend that to a new one.

1:19:23.340 --> 1:19:24.700
 And I'm not naive.

1:19:24.700 --> 1:19:27.220
 I think people respond to political pressures.

1:19:27.220 --> 1:19:30.940
 And the way that we found this out was David Perdue,

1:19:30.940 --> 1:19:35.940
 who was just a total corporate dollar general CEO guy.

1:19:35.940 --> 1:19:39.740
 He was against the original $1,200 stimulus checks.

1:19:39.740 --> 1:19:42.540
 But then Trump came out, who's the single most popular

1:19:42.540 --> 1:19:43.740
 figure in the Republican party.

1:19:43.740 --> 1:19:45.380
 He's like, I want $2,000 stimulus checks.

1:19:45.380 --> 1:19:49.340
 And all of a sudden, Perdue running in Georgia is like,

1:19:49.340 --> 1:19:51.080
 yeah, I'm with President Trump,

1:19:51.080 --> 1:19:53.500
 I want a $2,000 stimulus check.

1:19:53.500 --> 1:19:55.900
 That was, if you're an astute observer of politics,

1:19:55.900 --> 1:19:59.260
 to say, you can see there that you can force people

1:19:59.260 --> 1:20:02.260
 to do the right thing because it's the popular thing.

1:20:02.260 --> 1:20:04.940
 And that if it's clean, if you don't give them

1:20:04.940 --> 1:20:07.740
 any other excuse, they have to do it.

1:20:07.740 --> 1:20:11.580
 So this is what we've been gaslit into our culture war

1:20:11.580 --> 1:20:13.100
 framework of politics.

1:20:13.100 --> 1:20:17.340
 And the reason it feels so broken and awful

1:20:17.340 --> 1:20:20.580
 is because it is, but there is a way out.

1:20:20.580 --> 1:20:23.740
 It's just that nobody wants to be, it's a game of chicken,

1:20:23.740 --> 1:20:24.780
 because maybe it is true.

1:20:24.780 --> 1:20:26.500
 Maybe we would never be able to get

1:20:26.500 --> 1:20:27.840
 your other democratic priorities,

1:20:27.840 --> 1:20:29.320
 your Republican priorities.

1:20:29.320 --> 1:20:31.440
 But I think that the country understands

1:20:31.440 --> 1:20:35.060
 that this is fucking terrible and would be willing

1:20:35.060 --> 1:20:37.100
 to support somebody who does it differently.

1:20:37.100 --> 1:20:41.020
 There's just a lot of disincentives to not stay without,

1:20:41.020 --> 1:20:43.640
 there's a lot of incentives to not stray

1:20:43.640 --> 1:20:44.860
 from the traditional path.

1:20:44.860 --> 1:20:49.540
 Yeah, is it also possible that the A students

1:20:49.540 --> 1:20:51.340
 are not participating?

1:20:51.340 --> 1:20:56.260
 Like we drove all of the superstars away from politics.

1:20:56.260 --> 1:20:58.620
 So like you just had this argument before.

1:20:58.620 --> 1:21:03.620
 I mean, everything you're saying sort of rings true.

1:21:06.260 --> 1:21:08.340
 Like this is the obvious thing to do.

1:21:08.340 --> 1:21:10.820
 As a student of history, you can almost like tell,

1:21:10.820 --> 1:21:14.340
 like, if you look at great people in history,

1:21:14.340 --> 1:21:15.820
 this is what great leaders in history,

1:21:15.820 --> 1:21:17.100
 this is what they did.

1:21:17.100 --> 1:21:22.100
 It's like clean, bold action, sometimes facing crisis,

1:21:23.780 --> 1:21:24.860
 but we're facing a crisis right now.

1:21:24.860 --> 1:21:25.700
 No, we're in a crisis.

1:21:25.700 --> 1:21:27.420
 We've been, exactly.

1:21:27.420 --> 1:21:32.420
 So why don't we see those leaders step up?

1:21:33.460 --> 1:21:36.620
 I mean, you say that's kind of like, it makes sense.

1:21:36.620 --> 1:21:39.220
 There's a lot of different interests at play.

1:21:39.220 --> 1:21:41.800
 You don't wanna risk too many things, so on and so forth.

1:21:41.800 --> 1:21:45.940
 But that sounds like the C students.

1:21:45.940 --> 1:21:47.380
 I don't think it's that.

1:21:47.380 --> 1:21:51.180
 I think it's that the pipeline of politician creation

1:21:51.180 --> 1:21:54.240
 is just totally broken from beginning to end.

1:21:54.240 --> 1:21:59.240
 So it's not that A students don't wanna be politicians.

1:21:59.380 --> 1:22:02.620
 It's basically the way that our current primary system

1:22:02.620 --> 1:22:05.580
 is constructed, is what is the greatest threat to you

1:22:05.580 --> 1:22:07.100
 as a member of Congress?

1:22:07.100 --> 1:22:10.380
 It's not losing your reelection.

1:22:10.380 --> 1:22:13.320
 It's losing your primary, right?

1:22:13.320 --> 1:22:16.180
 So that means, especially in a safe district,

1:22:16.180 --> 1:22:18.200
 you're most concerned about being hit

1:22:18.200 --> 1:22:19.780
 if you're a Republican from the right,

1:22:19.780 --> 1:22:21.380
 and if you're a Democrat from the left

1:22:21.380 --> 1:22:22.820
 for not being a good enough one.

1:22:22.820 --> 1:22:25.580
 That's actually what stops people,

1:22:25.580 --> 1:22:28.580
 heterodox people in particular, from winning primaries

1:22:28.580 --> 1:22:30.740
 because the people who vote in our primaries

1:22:30.740 --> 1:22:32.220
 are the party faithful.

1:22:32.220 --> 1:22:35.140
 That's how you get the production.

1:22:35.140 --> 1:22:37.300
 It's important to understand the production pipeline,

1:22:37.300 --> 1:22:39.700
 which is that, all right, I'm from Texas,

1:22:39.700 --> 1:22:40.700
 so that's what I know best.

1:22:40.700 --> 1:22:43.000
 So it's like, if you think in Texas,

1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:46.100
 if you're a more heterodox like state legislature

1:22:46.100 --> 1:22:49.820
 or something who works with the left on this and does that,

1:22:49.820 --> 1:22:52.640
 you're gonna get your ass beat in a Republican primary

1:22:52.640 --> 1:22:53.480
 because they're gonna be like,

1:22:53.480 --> 1:22:56.780
 he worked with the left to do this, blah, blah,

1:22:56.780 --> 1:22:58.820
 take it out of context, and you're screwed.

1:22:58.820 --> 1:23:01.660
 And then that means you never ascend up

1:23:01.660 --> 1:23:03.260
 the next level of the ladder,

1:23:03.260 --> 1:23:05.580
 and then so on and so forth all the way.

1:23:05.580 --> 1:23:08.260
 But I do think Trump changed everything.

1:23:08.260 --> 1:23:09.860
 This is why I have some hope,

1:23:09.860 --> 1:23:14.860
 which is that he showed me that all the people I listened to

1:23:14.900 --> 1:23:16.820
 were totally wrong about politics,

1:23:16.820 --> 1:23:18.940
 and that's the most valuable lesson you could ever teach me,

1:23:18.940 --> 1:23:20.760
 which was, I was like, wait,

1:23:20.760 --> 1:23:22.380
 I don't really have to listen to these people.

1:23:22.380 --> 1:23:24.940
 I'm like, they don't know anything, actually.

1:23:24.940 --> 1:23:26.020
 That's powerful, man.

1:23:26.020 --> 1:23:27.020
 I'm like, he did it.

1:23:27.020 --> 1:23:28.500
 This guy.

1:23:28.500 --> 1:23:32.460
 Even if he didn't do anything with it.

1:23:32.460 --> 1:23:33.500
 It doesn't matter.

1:23:33.500 --> 1:23:35.740
 He showed that it's possible.

1:23:35.740 --> 1:23:39.580
 And that means a lot.

1:23:39.580 --> 1:23:40.600
 You're absolutely right.

1:23:40.600 --> 1:23:42.080
 There's young people right now

1:23:42.080 --> 1:23:44.860
 that kind of look, turn around and like, huh.

1:23:44.860 --> 1:23:46.820
 You're like, wait, I don't have to comb my hair

1:23:46.820 --> 1:23:50.500
 a certain way and go to law school and be an asshole

1:23:50.500 --> 1:23:52.660
 who everybody knows is an asshole.

1:23:52.660 --> 1:23:55.060
 And then get elected to state legislature.

1:23:55.060 --> 1:23:57.740
 I mean, look, who's the number one person

1:23:57.740 --> 1:24:01.100
 in the New York City primary right now?

1:24:01.100 --> 1:24:02.020
 Andrew Yang.

1:24:02.020 --> 1:24:05.620
 He's polling higher than everybody else in the race.

1:24:05.620 --> 1:24:07.300
 Look, maybe the polls are totally fucked

1:24:07.300 --> 1:24:09.340
 and maybe he'll lose because of ranked choice voting

1:24:09.340 --> 1:24:10.260
 and all of that.

1:24:10.260 --> 1:24:12.380
 But I consider Andrew, I mean, I know him a little bit

1:24:12.380 --> 1:24:15.100
 and I've followed his candidacy from the very beginning.

1:24:15.100 --> 1:24:16.660
 I consider him an inspiration.

1:24:16.660 --> 1:24:19.660
 He's the new generation of politics.

1:24:19.660 --> 1:24:22.900
 Like if I see who's gonna be president 20 years from now,

1:24:22.900 --> 1:24:24.980
 it's gonna be, I'm not saying it's gonna be Andrew Yang.

1:24:24.980 --> 1:24:27.220
 I think it's gonna be somebody like Andrew Yang

1:24:27.220 --> 1:24:28.740
 outside the political system

1:24:28.740 --> 1:24:31.700
 who talks in a totally different way, right?

1:24:31.700 --> 1:24:34.280
 Just a completely, one of my favorite things

1:24:34.280 --> 1:24:35.300
 that he said on the debate stage,

1:24:35.300 --> 1:24:37.900
 he's like, look at us, we're all wearing makeup.

1:24:37.900 --> 1:24:38.740
 It's crazy, you know?

1:24:38.740 --> 1:24:42.180
 And he like, he like brought that, that he brought that.

1:24:42.180 --> 1:24:44.580
 And he's writing like, yeah, why are they all wearing makeup?

1:24:44.580 --> 1:24:47.380
 He probably arguably hasn't gone far enough almost.

1:24:47.380 --> 1:24:48.500
 Yes.

1:24:48.500 --> 1:24:50.040
 But he showed that it's possible.

1:24:50.040 --> 1:24:53.260
 And then you see other, like AOC is a good example

1:24:53.260 --> 1:24:55.420
 of somebody, at least in my opinion,

1:24:55.420 --> 1:24:59.580
 is doing the same kind of thing, but going too far in like,

1:24:59.580 --> 1:25:01.460
 well, I don't know, she's doing the Trump thing,

1:25:01.460 --> 1:25:02.300
 but on the other side.

1:25:02.300 --> 1:25:04.220
 So I don't know, what's too far?

1:25:04.220 --> 1:25:05.060
 Who knows?

1:25:05.060 --> 1:25:05.900
 Don't take a normative judgment of it.

1:25:05.900 --> 1:25:06.720
 Yeah.

1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:07.560
 I will tell you the future of politics

1:25:07.560 --> 1:25:08.640
 looks like AOC. Appreciate the art of it.

1:25:08.640 --> 1:25:09.480
 Right, no, I do.

1:25:09.480 --> 1:25:12.020
 Look, I don't, I'm not a big AOC fan,

1:25:12.020 --> 1:25:14.180
 but she's a genius, media genius,

1:25:14.180 --> 1:25:16.000
 once in a generation talent.

1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:19.660
 The way that she uses social media, Instagram,

1:25:19.660 --> 1:25:21.660
 and everybody on the right is like trying to copy her.

1:25:21.660 --> 1:25:24.260
 Like Matt Gaetz is like, I want to be the conservative AOC.

1:25:24.260 --> 1:25:25.580
 I'm like, it's just not going to happen, dude.

1:25:25.580 --> 1:25:27.180
 Like you just don't have it.

1:25:27.180 --> 1:25:29.900
 Like what she has, it's like, it's electric.

1:25:29.900 --> 1:25:31.940
 And Trump had that.

1:25:31.940 --> 1:25:33.620
 Like I've been to a Trump rally,

1:25:33.620 --> 1:25:35.660
 like to cover as a journalist,

1:25:35.660 --> 1:25:37.420
 and there's nothing like it in America.

1:25:37.420 --> 1:25:39.020
 And Yang is similar.

1:25:39.020 --> 1:25:40.440
 It's the same way where you're like,

1:25:40.440 --> 1:25:43.060
 there is something going on here,

1:25:43.060 --> 1:25:45.740
 which is just like, I've been doing Obama rally.

1:25:45.740 --> 1:25:47.380
 I've been to a Clinton rally.

1:25:47.380 --> 1:25:50.900
 I've been to several normal politics.

1:25:50.900 --> 1:25:54.660
 It's fine, you know, with Trump and with Yang,

1:25:54.660 --> 1:25:56.260
 it was, it's another world.

1:25:56.260 --> 1:25:57.100
 It's another world.

1:25:57.100 --> 1:25:57.940
 Yeah, Yang gang.

1:25:57.940 --> 1:26:00.220
 There's probably thousands of people listening right now,

1:26:00.220 --> 1:26:03.040
 who are just like doing a slow clap.

1:26:03.040 --> 1:26:03.880
 Yes.

1:26:03.880 --> 1:26:05.080
 I know, I know.

1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:06.820
 Yang gang forever.

1:26:06.820 --> 1:26:10.380
 Okay, but yeah, I mean, my worst fear,

1:26:10.380 --> 1:26:15.380
 I prefer Andrew Yang kind of free improvisational idea,

1:26:19.100 --> 1:26:21.620
 exchange, all that versus AOC,

1:26:21.620 --> 1:26:25.420
 who I think no matter what she stands for

1:26:25.420 --> 1:26:29.420
 is a drama machine, creates dramas just like Trump does.

1:26:29.420 --> 1:26:33.260
 I would say my worst fear would be in 2024,

1:26:33.260 --> 1:26:34.500
 is AOC old enough?

1:26:34.500 --> 1:26:36.320
 It'd be AOC versus Trump.

1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:37.420
 I don't think she's old enough.

1:26:37.420 --> 1:26:38.860
 I think you'd have to be, I don't know.

1:26:38.860 --> 1:26:39.700
 I think she's 30.

1:26:39.700 --> 1:26:40.780
 So she needs five more years.

1:26:40.780 --> 1:26:41.860
 So probably not.

1:26:41.860 --> 1:26:42.700
 Yeah.

1:26:42.700 --> 1:26:45.460
 Okay, but that kind of, that's, or Trump Jr.

1:26:45.460 --> 1:26:47.620
 Well, AOC probably wouldn't win a Democratic primary.

1:26:47.620 --> 1:26:49.660
 So, I mean, look, Joe Biden is, you know,

1:26:49.660 --> 1:26:50.980
 he's pretty much showed that.

1:26:50.980 --> 1:26:52.500
 That's exactly what you're saying.

1:26:52.500 --> 1:26:55.820
 This process grooms you over time.

1:26:55.820 --> 1:26:57.860
 You see the same thing in academia actually,

1:26:57.860 --> 1:26:59.940
 which is very interesting,

1:26:59.940 --> 1:27:02.520
 is the process of getting tenure.

1:27:02.520 --> 1:27:06.060
 There's this, it's like you're being taught

1:27:06.060 --> 1:27:09.640
 without explicitly being taught

1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:14.480
 to behave in the way that everybody's behaved before.

1:27:14.480 --> 1:27:15.640
 I've heard this, it was funny.

1:27:15.640 --> 1:27:17.800
 I've had a few conversations

1:27:17.800 --> 1:27:20.680
 that were deeply disappointing,

1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:25.040
 which involved statements like,

1:27:25.040 --> 1:27:28.080
 this is what's good for your career.

1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:29.380
 This kind of conversation,

1:27:29.380 --> 1:27:33.480
 almost like mentor to mentee conversation,

1:27:33.480 --> 1:27:36.680
 or it's like, there's a grooming process in the same way.

1:27:36.680 --> 1:27:39.040
 I guess you're saying the primary process

1:27:39.040 --> 1:27:40.040
 does the same kind of thing.

1:27:40.040 --> 1:27:42.320
 So, I mean, that's what people have talked about

1:27:42.320 --> 1:27:43.160
 with Andrew Yang.

1:27:43.160 --> 1:27:46.880
 He was being suppressed by a bunch of different forces,

1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:48.520
 the mainstream media and all.

1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:51.040
 Just the Democratic, just that whole process

1:27:51.040 --> 1:27:55.240
 didn't like the honesty that he was showing, right?

1:27:55.240 --> 1:27:57.360
 For now, but here's my question to you.

1:27:57.360 --> 1:27:59.680
 People gotta see, look, Jordan Peterson

1:27:59.680 --> 1:28:01.680
 is one of the most famous people in America, right?

1:28:01.680 --> 1:28:03.680
 Like you have a massive podcast.

1:28:03.680 --> 1:28:07.200
 You're more famous than half, 99% of the people at MIT.

1:28:07.200 --> 1:28:10.680
 So like, from that perspective, everything has changed.

1:28:10.680 --> 1:28:12.360
 And somewhere out there,

1:28:12.360 --> 1:28:14.320
 there's a student who's taking notice.

1:28:14.320 --> 1:28:16.040
 And I've noticed that with my own career,

1:28:16.040 --> 1:28:17.280
 everybody thought I was crazy

1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:19.040
 for doing this show with Crystal, The Hill.

1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:19.880
 They thought I was nuts.

1:28:19.880 --> 1:28:21.080
 They're like, what are you doing?

1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:22.520
 You're a White House correspondent.

1:28:22.520 --> 1:28:24.440
 You've got a job forever.

1:28:24.440 --> 1:28:25.600
 The other job offer I had

1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:27.280
 was being a White House correspondent.

1:28:27.280 --> 1:28:29.440
 And people thought I was nuts

1:28:29.440 --> 1:28:34.120
 for not just sticking there and aging out within Washington,

1:28:34.120 --> 1:28:39.120
 pining for appearances on Fox News and CNN and MSNBC.

1:28:39.240 --> 1:28:40.200
 But I hated it.

1:28:40.200 --> 1:28:41.360
 I just hated doing it.

1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:44.240
 I did not wanna be a company man, like a Washington man,

1:28:44.240 --> 1:28:47.040
 who's one of those guys who like brags to his friends

1:28:47.040 --> 1:28:49.440
 about how many times he's been on Fox or whatever,

1:28:49.440 --> 1:28:51.760
 mostly because I just have a rebellious streak

1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:55.280
 and I hate being at the subject of other people.

1:28:55.280 --> 1:28:56.280
 I created something new,

1:28:56.280 --> 1:28:58.360
 which a lot of people watch to get their news.

1:28:58.360 --> 1:29:00.840
 And I noticed that younger people

1:29:00.840 --> 1:29:02.760
 who are almost all my audience,

1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:05.000
 they don't really look up to any of the people

1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:06.080
 in traditional, right?

1:29:06.080 --> 1:29:09.000
 They don't go and they're not coming up and being like,

1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:10.800
 how do I be like Jim Acosta?

1:29:10.800 --> 1:29:13.760
 You know, they're like, hey, how did you do what you do?

1:29:13.760 --> 1:29:16.440
 And the way you did it is by bucking the system.

1:29:16.440 --> 1:29:20.280
 So I think that we are at a total split point.

1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:23.600
 And look, there will always be a path for people.

1:29:23.600 --> 1:29:26.160
 Cause like, I don't want people to over learn this lesson.

1:29:26.160 --> 1:29:27.760
 I have people who are like, I'm not gonna go to college.

1:29:27.760 --> 1:29:29.360
 And I'm like, well, just wait.

1:29:29.360 --> 1:29:32.400
 Yeah, like, I'm like, just like stop,

1:29:32.400 --> 1:29:34.840
 just like, just hold on a second.

1:29:34.840 --> 1:29:37.680
 But there will always be a path for the institutional

1:29:37.680 --> 1:29:39.240
 that will always be there for you.

1:29:39.240 --> 1:29:40.920
 But now there's something else.

1:29:40.920 --> 1:29:42.400
 Now there's another game in town.

1:29:42.400 --> 1:29:45.120
 And that's more appealing to millions and millions

1:29:45.120 --> 1:29:46.960
 and millions and millions of people

1:29:46.960 --> 1:29:50.080
 who feel unserved by the corporate media,

1:29:50.080 --> 1:29:52.040
 CNN and these people,

1:29:52.040 --> 1:29:56.000
 possibly who feel unserved in the, you know, the faculty.

1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:59.000
 Like if you are an up and comer

1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:02.640
 who wants to teach as many young people as possible,

1:30:02.640 --> 1:30:04.600
 I think you should be on YouTube, right?

1:30:04.600 --> 1:30:05.920
 Like look at the Khan Academy guy,

1:30:05.920 --> 1:30:07.940
 that guy created a huge business.

1:30:07.940 --> 1:30:10.520
 So I just think we can be cynical

1:30:10.520 --> 1:30:12.640
 and like upset about what that system is,

1:30:12.640 --> 1:30:14.000
 but we should also have hope.

1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:16.960
 Like I have a lot of hope for what can be in the future.

1:30:16.960 --> 1:30:18.920
 Yeah, there's a guy people should check out.

1:30:18.920 --> 1:30:20.600
 So my story is a little bit different

1:30:20.600 --> 1:30:24.080
 because I basically stepped aside

1:30:24.080 --> 1:30:28.360
 with the dream of being an entrepreneur

1:30:28.360 --> 1:30:30.320
 earlier in the pipeline

1:30:30.320 --> 1:30:34.360
 than like a legitimate, like senior faculty would.

1:30:34.360 --> 1:30:36.480
 There's an example of somebody people should check out,

1:30:36.480 --> 1:30:40.200
 Andrew Huberman from Stanford, who's a neuroscientist,

1:30:40.200 --> 1:30:42.480
 who's as world class as it gets

1:30:42.480 --> 1:30:45.340
 in terms of like 10 year faculty,

1:30:45.340 --> 1:30:48.320
 just a really world class researcher.

1:30:48.320 --> 1:30:50.120
 And now he's doing YouTube.

1:30:50.120 --> 1:30:51.380
 Yeah, I see him on Instagram.

1:30:51.380 --> 1:30:52.220
 Yeah.

1:30:52.220 --> 1:30:53.040
 And he's great.

1:30:53.040 --> 1:30:56.640
 So he not just does Instagram, he now has a podcast

1:30:56.640 --> 1:31:00.440
 and he's changing the nature of like,

1:31:00.440 --> 1:31:04.760
 I believe that Andrew might be the future of Stanford.

1:31:04.760 --> 1:31:08.320
 And for a lot, it's funny, like he's basically,

1:31:08.320 --> 1:31:13.040
 Joe Rogan is an inspiration to Andrew and to me as well.

1:31:13.040 --> 1:31:15.800
 And those ripple effects and Andrew is an inspiration

1:31:15.800 --> 1:31:18.560
 probably just like you're saying to these young,

1:31:18.560 --> 1:31:22.000
 like 25 year olds who are soon to become faculty,

1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:23.800
 if we're just talking about academia.

1:31:23.800 --> 1:31:27.920
 And the same is probably happening with government is,

1:31:27.920 --> 1:31:31.540
 funny enough, Trump probably is inspiring

1:31:31.540 --> 1:31:34.240
 a huge number of people who are saying, wait a minute,

1:31:34.240 --> 1:31:36.120
 I don't have to play by the rules.

1:31:36.120 --> 1:31:40.520
 And I can think outside the box here and you're right.

1:31:40.520 --> 1:31:42.420
 And the institutions we're seeing

1:31:42.420 --> 1:31:44.520
 are just probably lagging behind.

1:31:44.520 --> 1:31:48.040
 So the optimistic view is the future

1:31:48.040 --> 1:31:50.200
 is going to be full of exciting new ideas.

1:31:50.200 --> 1:31:52.100
 So Andrew Young is just kind of the beginning

1:31:52.100 --> 1:31:52.940
 of this whole thing.

1:31:52.940 --> 1:31:54.480
 He's the tip of the iceberg.

1:31:54.480 --> 1:31:57.720
 And I hope that iceberg doesn't, it's not this influencer.

1:31:57.720 --> 1:32:01.240
 One of the things that really bothers me,

1:32:01.240 --> 1:32:03.520
 I've gotten the chance, I should be careful here.

1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:05.640
 I don't wanna, I love everybody,

1:32:05.640 --> 1:32:09.680
 but these people who talk about like,

1:32:09.680 --> 1:32:13.160
 how to make your first million or how to succeed.

1:32:13.160 --> 1:32:16.520
 And they're so, I mean, yeah,

1:32:16.520 --> 1:32:19.120
 that makes me a little bit cynical

1:32:19.120 --> 1:32:23.800
 about, I'm worried that the people

1:32:23.800 --> 1:32:26.240
 that win the game of politics will be ones

1:32:26.240 --> 1:32:29.800
 that want to win the game of politics.

1:32:29.800 --> 1:32:31.140
 They are, they are, man.

1:32:31.140 --> 1:32:33.720
 And like we mentioned, AOC,

1:32:33.720 --> 1:32:38.720
 I hope they optimize for the 80% populist thing, right?

1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:42.360
 Like they optimize for that bad thing,

1:32:42.360 --> 1:32:44.680
 that history will remember you as the great man

1:32:44.680 --> 1:32:46.380
 or woman that did this thing,

1:32:46.380 --> 1:32:50.000
 versus how do I maximize engagement today

1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:51.720
 and keep growing those numbers?

1:32:51.720 --> 1:32:55.640
 The influencers are so, I'm so allergic to this, man.

1:32:56.520 --> 1:32:58.460
 They keep saying how many followers they have

1:32:58.460 --> 1:33:00.080
 on the different accounts.

1:33:00.080 --> 1:33:04.280
 And it's like, I don't think they understand.

1:33:04.280 --> 1:33:05.760
 Maybe I don't understand.

1:33:05.760 --> 1:33:06.780
 I don't really care.

1:33:07.760 --> 1:33:12.340
 I think it has destructive psychological effects.

1:33:13.360 --> 1:33:15.600
 One, like thinking about the number,

1:33:15.600 --> 1:33:19.800
 like getting excited, your number went from 100 to 101

1:33:19.800 --> 1:33:23.400
 and being like, and today went out to 105.

1:33:23.400 --> 1:33:24.600
 Whoa, that's a big jump.

1:33:24.600 --> 1:33:26.160
 Then maybe like thinking this way,

1:33:26.160 --> 1:33:28.820
 like I wonder what I did, I'll do that again.

1:33:28.820 --> 1:33:31.640
 In this way, one, it creates anxiety

1:33:31.640 --> 1:33:34.040
 and those psychological effects, whatever.

1:33:34.040 --> 1:33:37.040
 The more important thing is it prevents you

1:33:37.040 --> 1:33:42.040
 from truly thinking boldly in the long arc of history

1:33:42.040 --> 1:33:45.920
 and creatively, thinking outside the box,

1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:48.000
 doing huge actions.

1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:50.520
 And I actually, my optimism is in the sense

1:33:50.520 --> 1:33:54.360
 that that kind of action will beat out all the influencers.

1:33:54.360 --> 1:33:58.120
 Well, I don't know, Lex, this is where my cynicism comes in.

1:33:58.120 --> 1:34:00.520
 So there's a guy, Madison Cawthorn,

1:34:00.520 --> 1:34:02.760
 the youngest member of Congress.

1:34:02.760 --> 1:34:05.760
 And he, I don't want to say got caught,

1:34:05.760 --> 1:34:08.080
 but there was like an email where he was like,

1:34:08.080 --> 1:34:11.640
 my staff is only oriented around comms.

1:34:11.640 --> 1:34:12.740
 Like he was basically saying,

1:34:12.740 --> 1:34:14.680
 he got basically caught saying like,

1:34:14.680 --> 1:34:19.560
 my staff is only centered on communications.

1:34:19.560 --> 1:34:21.200
 And that's the right play.

1:34:21.200 --> 1:34:23.840
 If you do want to get the benefits

1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:26.720
 of our current electoral political and engagement system,

1:34:26.720 --> 1:34:29.260
 which is that what's the best way to be known

1:34:29.260 --> 1:34:32.160
 within the right as a right wing politician.

1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:36.680
 It's to be a culture warrior, go on Ben Shapiro's podcast,

1:34:36.680 --> 1:34:39.040
 be one of the people on Fox News,

1:34:39.040 --> 1:34:41.760
 go on Sean Hannity's show, go on Tucker's show

1:34:41.760 --> 1:34:45.180
 and all of that, because you become a mini celebrity

1:34:45.180 --> 1:34:46.960
 within that world.

1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:50.360
 Left unsaid is that that world is increasingly shrinking

1:34:50.360 --> 1:34:52.080
 portion of the American population.

1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:56.020
 And they barely, they can't even win a popular vote election,

1:34:56.020 --> 1:34:59.640
 let alone barely win, eke out an electoral college victory

1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:01.640
 in 2016.

1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:04.600
 Well, but the incentives are all aligned within that.

1:35:04.600 --> 1:35:06.840
 And it's the same thing really on the left,

1:35:06.840 --> 1:35:08.680
 but you're right, which is that,

1:35:08.680 --> 1:35:11.520
 ultimately, and look, this is why geniuses are geniuses

1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:15.160
 because they buck the short term incentives.

1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:18.380
 They focus on the long term, they bet big

1:35:18.380 --> 1:35:19.560
 and they usually fail.

1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:24.640
 But then when they get big, they succeed spectacularly.

1:35:24.640 --> 1:35:27.400
 The people I know who have done this the best

1:35:27.400 --> 1:35:30.840
 are like a lot of the crypto folks that I've spoken to.

1:35:30.840 --> 1:35:32.840
 Like some of the stuff they say, I'm like,

1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:34.240
 I don't know if that's gonna happen,

1:35:34.240 --> 1:35:36.280
 but look, they're like billionaires, right?

1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:38.960
 And you're like, so they were right.

1:35:38.960 --> 1:35:43.240
 The way I've heard it expressed is you can be wrong a lot,

1:35:43.240 --> 1:35:45.680
 but when you're right, you get right big.

1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:47.680
 And I mean, I've seen this in Elon Musk's career.

1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:52.680
 I mean, he took spectacular risk, like spectacular risk

1:35:52.720 --> 1:35:55.000
 and just doubled down, doubled down, doubled down,

1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:56.120
 doubled down, doubled down.

1:35:56.120 --> 1:35:57.760
 And you can kind of tell to him,

1:35:57.760 --> 1:35:59.040
 I mean, you know him better than I do,

1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:00.560
 but like from my observation,

1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:03.360
 I don't think the money matters, right?

1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:07.080
 I just, like when I see him, I'm like, I don't,

1:36:07.080 --> 1:36:08.760
 nobody works as hard as you do

1:36:08.760 --> 1:36:10.920
 and builds the way that you build

1:36:10.920 --> 1:36:12.280
 if it's just about the money.

1:36:12.280 --> 1:36:13.680
 It just doesn't happen.

1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:18.320
 Like nobody wills SpaceX into existence just for the money.

1:36:18.320 --> 1:36:19.880
 Like it's not worth it, frankly, right?

1:36:19.880 --> 1:36:21.840
 Like he probably destroyed years of his life

1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:23.440
 and like mental sanity.

1:36:23.440 --> 1:36:25.280
 Money or attention or fame, none of that.

1:36:25.280 --> 1:36:26.120
 Yeah.

1:36:26.120 --> 1:36:26.960
 It's not the primary priority.

1:36:26.960 --> 1:36:28.520
 Well, that's what's so appealing to me,

1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:31.360
 to me in particular about him, just like in how he built.

1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:32.640
 Like I read a biography of him

1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:34.880
 and just like the way that he constructed his life

1:36:34.880 --> 1:36:36.680
 and like we're able to hyperfocus

1:36:36.680 --> 1:36:38.560
 in meeting after meeting and drill down

1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:40.480
 and also hire all the right people

1:36:40.480 --> 1:36:43.320
 who execute each one of his tasks discreetly

1:36:43.320 --> 1:36:45.480
 to his perfection is amazing.

1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:48.520
 Like that's actually the mark of a good leader.

1:36:48.520 --> 1:36:50.680
 But I mean, if you think about his career,

1:36:50.680 --> 1:36:53.200
 the reason he's a renegade is cause probably he was told

1:36:53.200 --> 1:36:55.440
 to like put it in an index fund or whatever.

1:36:55.440 --> 1:36:57.480
 Like whenever he made his like 29 million

1:36:57.480 --> 1:36:59.520
 and from PayPal, I don't know how much he made.

1:36:59.520 --> 1:37:01.360
 And then just go along that road and he's like, no.

1:37:01.360 --> 1:37:04.040
 So he succeeds spectacularly.

1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:07.240
 So you have to have somebody who's willing to come in

1:37:07.240 --> 1:37:08.240
 and buck that system.

1:37:08.240 --> 1:37:12.080
 So for now, I think our politics are generally frozen.

1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:16.880
 I think that that model is gonna be most generally appealing

1:37:16.880 --> 1:37:20.120
 to the mean person, but somebody will come along

1:37:20.120 --> 1:37:20.960
 and we'll change everything.

1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:22.720
 Yeah, I'm just surprised there's not more of them.

1:37:22.720 --> 1:37:23.560
 Yeah.

1:37:23.560 --> 1:37:28.040
 On that topic, it's now 20, what is it, 21?

1:37:28.040 --> 1:37:28.880
 Yes.

1:37:28.880 --> 1:37:31.520
 Let's make some predictions that you can be wrong about.

1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:32.360
 Good.

1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:38.120
 What major political people are you thinking will run

1:37:38.120 --> 1:37:43.120
 in 2024, including Trump, junior, senior, or Ivanka?

1:37:44.160 --> 1:37:45.000
 I don't know.

1:37:46.200 --> 1:37:47.160
 Any Trump.

1:37:47.160 --> 1:37:48.000
 Trump.

1:37:49.960 --> 1:37:52.360
 And who do you think wins?

1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:56.080
 I think Joe Biden will run again in 2024.

1:37:56.080 --> 1:37:57.680
 And I think he will run against someone

1:37:57.680 --> 1:37:59.600
 with the last name Trump.

1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:03.800
 I do not know whether that is Trump or Trump junior,

1:38:03.800 --> 1:38:06.160
 but I think one of those people will probably

1:38:06.160 --> 1:38:08.240
 be the GOP nominee in 2024.

1:38:08.240 --> 1:38:09.080
 Who is it?

1:38:09.080 --> 1:38:11.360
 Some prominent political figure, was it Romney?

1:38:11.360 --> 1:38:14.400
 Somebody like that said that Trump will win the primary

1:38:14.400 --> 1:38:15.240
 if he runs again.

1:38:15.240 --> 1:38:16.680
 Of course, that's not even a question.

1:38:16.680 --> 1:38:19.000
 Trump is the single most popular figure

1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:22.320
 in the Republican party by orders of magnitude.

1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:23.160
 Still.

1:38:23.160 --> 1:38:25.280
 Oh, I mean, probably more, honestly.

1:38:25.280 --> 1:38:26.680
 There was a, actually, I can tell you

1:38:26.680 --> 1:38:30.240
 because I saw the data, which is that pre January 6th,

1:38:30.240 --> 1:38:33.720
 it was like 54% of Republicans wanted him to run again.

1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:37.320
 Then it went down eight points after January 6th,

1:38:37.320 --> 1:38:38.400
 two days later.

1:38:38.400 --> 1:38:42.400
 And then after impeachment, it went right back up to 54%.

1:38:42.400 --> 1:38:47.160
 So the exact same number is in February,

1:38:47.160 --> 1:38:50.000
 post impeachment vote, as it was after November.

1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:52.600
 Now look, yeah, again, surveys, bullshit, et cetera.

1:38:52.600 --> 1:38:54.080
 But like, that's all the data we have.

1:38:54.080 --> 1:38:55.480
 That's what I can point you to.

1:38:55.480 --> 1:38:57.840
 If Trump runs, he will be the nominee

1:38:57.840 --> 1:39:00.920
 and he will be the 2024 nominee.

1:39:00.920 --> 1:39:02.320
 I just don't know if he wants to.

1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:04.120
 It really depends.

1:39:04.120 --> 1:39:05.560
 Do you think he wins?

1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:09.080
 After the Trump vaccine heals all of us,

1:39:09.080 --> 1:39:10.200
 do you think Trump wins?

1:39:10.200 --> 1:39:12.440
 It depends on how popular culture functions

1:39:12.440 --> 1:39:13.480
 over the next four years.

1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:15.200
 And I can tell you that they are,

1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:17.040
 because I don't think Biden has that much to do with it.

1:39:17.040 --> 1:39:20.840
 Because again, Trump is not a manifestation

1:39:20.840 --> 1:39:22.880
 of an affirmative policy action.

1:39:22.880 --> 1:39:27.880
 It is a defensive bulwark wall against cultural liberalism.

1:39:29.720 --> 1:39:33.320
 So it's like, this is why it doesn't matter what Biden does.

1:39:33.320 --> 1:39:35.120
 If there are more riots,

1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:38.840
 if there is a more sense of persecution

1:39:38.840 --> 1:39:42.960
 amongst people who are more lean towards conservative

1:39:42.960 --> 1:39:45.760
 or like, hey, I don't know about that, that's crazy,

1:39:45.760 --> 1:39:48.600
 then he very well could win.

1:39:48.600 --> 1:39:50.080
 Okay, let's say Joe Biden doesn't run

1:39:50.080 --> 1:39:51.320
 and they put up like Kamala Harris,

1:39:51.320 --> 1:39:53.000
 I think he would beat her.

1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:54.680
 I don't think there's a question

1:39:54.680 --> 1:39:56.920
 that Trump would beat Kamala Harris in 2024.

1:39:57.920 --> 1:39:59.480
 And you don't think anybody else,

1:39:59.480 --> 1:40:01.160
 I don't know how the process works,

1:40:01.160 --> 1:40:03.200
 you don't think anybody else on the Democratic side

1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:04.720
 can take the...

1:40:04.720 --> 1:40:07.680
 Well, how could you run against the sitting vice president?

1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:11.360
 It's like, Joe Biden has a 98% approval rating

1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:12.640
 in the Democratic Party.

1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:14.680
 If he says, she is my heir,

1:40:14.680 --> 1:40:16.400
 I think enough people will listen to him

1:40:16.400 --> 1:40:19.240
 in a competitive primary or a noncompetitive primary.

1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:20.240
 And then there's all these things

1:40:20.240 --> 1:40:23.080
 about how primary systems themselves are rigged,

1:40:23.080 --> 1:40:25.040
 the DNC could make it known

1:40:25.040 --> 1:40:26.520
 that they'll blacklist anybody

1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:29.760
 who does try and primary Kamala Harris.

1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:31.160
 And look, I mean,

1:40:31.160 --> 1:40:33.480
 progressives aren't necessarily all that popular

1:40:33.480 --> 1:40:34.960
 amongst actual Democrats,

1:40:34.960 --> 1:40:37.760
 like we found that out during the election.

1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:40.640
 There's an entire constituency which loves Joe Biden

1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:42.240
 and Joe Biden level politics.

1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:44.640
 And so if he tells them to vote for Kamala,

1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:47.120
 I think she would probably get it.

1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:49.960
 But again, there's a lot of game theory obviously happening.

1:40:49.960 --> 1:40:52.200
 Well, see, I think you're talking about

1:40:52.200 --> 1:40:54.080
 everything you're saying is correct

1:40:54.080 --> 1:40:55.960
 about mediocre candidates.

1:40:55.960 --> 1:40:59.600
 It feels like if there's somebody like a really strong,

1:40:59.600 --> 1:41:01.480
 I don't wanna use this term incorrectly,

1:41:01.480 --> 1:41:05.400
 but populist, somebody that speaks to the 80%

1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:10.400
 that is able to provide bold,

1:41:10.400 --> 1:41:15.080
 eloquently described solutions that are popular.

1:41:15.080 --> 1:41:17.200
 I think that breaks through all of this nonsense.

1:41:17.200 --> 1:41:18.040
 How?

1:41:18.040 --> 1:41:19.560
 How do they break through the primary system?

1:41:19.560 --> 1:41:22.520
 Cause the problem is the primary system is not populism.

1:41:22.520 --> 1:41:24.020
 It's primary.

1:41:24.020 --> 1:41:24.860
 So it's like.

1:41:24.860 --> 1:41:27.720
 But you don't think they can tweet their way to.

1:41:27.720 --> 1:41:30.720
 Well, you have to be willing to win a GOP primary.

1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:32.760
 You basically have to be at,

1:41:32.760 --> 1:41:35.440
 whoever wins the GOP primary, in my opinion,

1:41:35.440 --> 1:41:37.660
 will be the person most hated by the left.

1:41:37.660 --> 1:41:40.000
 One of the people, things that people forget is,

1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:41.920
 you know who came in second to Trump?

1:41:41.920 --> 1:41:42.960
 Ted Cruz.

1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:44.960
 And the reason why is because Ted Cruz

1:41:44.960 --> 1:41:48.720
 was the second most hated guy by liberals in America.

1:41:48.720 --> 1:41:49.880
 A second to Trump.

1:41:49.880 --> 1:41:51.560
 They have nothing in policy in common.

1:41:51.560 --> 1:41:54.880
 But don't you think this kind of brilliantly described

1:41:54.880 --> 1:41:59.880
 system of hate being the main mechanism

1:41:59.940 --> 1:42:02.240
 of our electoral choices,

1:42:02.240 --> 1:42:05.240
 don't you think that just has to do with mediocre candidates?

1:42:08.400 --> 1:42:11.240
 Basically the field of candidates, including Trump,

1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:13.680
 including everybody was just like,

1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:16.680
 didn't make anyone feel great.

1:42:16.680 --> 1:42:17.680
 It's like, really?

1:42:17.680 --> 1:42:19.680
 This is what we have to choose from?

1:42:19.680 --> 1:42:22.120
 Maybe a Mark Cuban,

1:42:22.120 --> 1:42:26.060
 or like a Mark Cuban is a Democrat,

1:42:26.060 --> 1:42:29.140
 or it would have to be somebody like that.

1:42:29.140 --> 1:42:30.920
 Somebody who, because here's the thing about Trump.

1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:32.360
 It's not just that it was Trump.

1:42:32.360 --> 1:42:34.320
 He was so fucking famous.

1:42:34.320 --> 1:42:36.880
 Like people don't realize he was so famous.

1:42:36.880 --> 1:42:39.880
 Like I, even when I first met Trump,

1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:41.720
 I met a couple of other presidents,

1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:44.520
 but when I met Trump, even I felt like kind of starstruck.

1:42:44.520 --> 1:42:47.440
 Cause I was like, yo, this is the guy from The Apprentice.

1:42:47.440 --> 1:42:49.440
 I'm like, this is the dude.

1:42:49.440 --> 1:42:50.800
 From The Apprentice?

1:42:50.800 --> 1:42:53.160
 Cause I'm like, my dad and I used to sit

1:42:53.160 --> 1:42:55.400
 and watch The Apprentice when I was in high school.

1:42:55.400 --> 1:42:57.480
 And then one of the guys was from College Station

1:42:57.480 --> 1:42:58.480
 where I grew up and we're like,

1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:00.880
 oh my God, like that guy's on The Apprentice.

1:43:00.880 --> 1:43:02.240
 Like it was a phenomenon.

1:43:02.240 --> 1:43:03.080
 There's like that level.

1:43:03.080 --> 1:43:04.240
 It's kind of like when I met Joe Rogan,

1:43:04.240 --> 1:43:06.720
 I'm like, holy shit, that's Joe Rogan.

1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:08.600
 I don't feel that way when I meet Mitt Romney,

1:43:08.600 --> 1:43:11.000
 or Tom Cotton, or Josh Hawley, I met all of them.

1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:12.440
 But there's a lot of celebrities, right?

1:43:12.440 --> 1:43:13.520
 Do you think there's some celebrities

1:43:13.520 --> 1:43:15.480
 you were not even thinking about that could step in?

1:43:15.480 --> 1:43:16.320
 The Rock?

1:43:16.320 --> 1:43:19.440
 So I was about to say, I think The Rock could do it,

1:43:19.440 --> 1:43:20.840
 but does he wanna do it?

1:43:20.840 --> 1:43:21.880
 I mean, it's terrible.

1:43:21.880 --> 1:43:23.720
 Like it's terrible gig.

1:43:23.720 --> 1:43:25.400
 It's very hard to do.

1:43:25.400 --> 1:43:27.480
 I don't know if The Rock necessarily has

1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:29.640
 like the formed policy agenda.

1:43:29.640 --> 1:43:31.080
 Cause then here's the other problem.

1:43:31.080 --> 1:43:32.880
 What if we set ourselves up for a system

1:43:32.880 --> 1:43:34.300
 where like these people keep winning,

1:43:34.300 --> 1:43:35.880
 but like with Trump, they have no idea

1:43:35.880 --> 1:43:37.000
 how to run a government.

1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:38.600
 It's actually really hard, right?

1:43:38.600 --> 1:43:41.000
 And you have to have the knowhow and the trust

1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:42.840
 to find the right people.

1:43:42.840 --> 1:43:46.600
 This is where the genius element comes in is,

1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:48.540
 you have to understand that front

1:43:48.540 --> 1:43:52.000
 and you have to understand how to execute discrete tasks.

1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:54.440
 Like this is the FDR.

1:43:54.440 --> 1:43:58.560
 This is why it's so hard, like FDR, Lincoln, TR.

1:43:58.560 --> 1:44:00.920
 They were who they were and they live in history

1:44:00.920 --> 1:44:04.220
 and their name rings like for a reason.

1:44:04.220 --> 1:44:07.060
 And yeah, I mean, one of the most depressing lessons

1:44:07.060 --> 1:44:11.900
 I got from 2020 is at almost, it seems like in my opinion,

1:44:11.900 --> 1:44:15.200
 that we over learn the lesson of our success

1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:16.520
 and not of our failures.

1:44:16.520 --> 1:44:19.520
 For example, like we have this narrative in our head

1:44:19.520 --> 1:44:21.860
 that we always have the right person

1:44:21.860 --> 1:44:23.880
 at the right time during crisis.

1:44:23.880 --> 1:44:25.600
 And in some cases it was true.

1:44:25.600 --> 1:44:26.940
 We didn't deserve Lincoln.

1:44:26.940 --> 1:44:28.520
 We didn't deserve FDR.

1:44:28.520 --> 1:44:33.360
 We didn't deserve a lot of presidents at times of crisis.

1:44:33.360 --> 1:44:36.800
 But then you're like, okay, George W. Bush, 9 11,

1:44:36.800 --> 1:44:38.460
 that was terrible.

1:44:38.460 --> 1:44:41.800
 Reconstruction, Andrew Johnson, awful, right?

1:44:41.800 --> 1:44:44.480
 Like we had several periods in our history

1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:48.440
 where the crisis was there, they were called

1:44:48.440 --> 1:44:50.120
 and they did not show up.

1:44:50.120 --> 1:44:54.040
 And I really, it hadn't happened in my lifetime

1:44:54.040 --> 1:44:55.640
 except for 9 11.

1:44:55.640 --> 1:44:58.760
 And even then you could kind of see that as an opportunity

1:44:58.760 --> 1:45:01.320
 for somebody like Obama to come in and fix it.

1:45:01.320 --> 1:45:02.640
 But then he didn't do it.

1:45:02.640 --> 1:45:04.520
 And then Trump didn't do it.

1:45:04.520 --> 1:45:09.260
 And you realize, I feel like our politics are most analogous

1:45:09.260 --> 1:45:13.960
 to like the 1910s, like all in terms of the Gilded Age,

1:45:13.960 --> 1:45:16.600
 in terms of that, remember there's that long period

1:45:16.600 --> 1:45:21.600
 of presidents between like Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt.

1:45:22.360 --> 1:45:24.440
 We were like, wait, like who was president?

1:45:24.440 --> 1:45:27.520
 Like, or even TR was like an exception

1:45:27.520 --> 1:45:30.040
 where you'll have like Calvin Coolidge who like,

1:45:30.040 --> 1:45:33.100
 silent cow, Grover Cleveland.

1:45:33.100 --> 1:45:36.600
 That's kind of how, if I think of us within history,

1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:38.820
 I feel like we're in one of those times.

1:45:38.820 --> 1:45:39.660
 We're just waiting.

1:45:39.660 --> 1:45:41.600
 It feels really important to us right now.

1:45:41.600 --> 1:45:43.600
 Like this is the most important moment in history,

1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:44.440
 but it might be.

1:45:44.440 --> 1:45:45.800
 It could just be a blip, right?

1:45:45.800 --> 1:45:46.860
 20, 30 year blip.

1:45:46.860 --> 1:45:48.820
 Like when you think about who was president

1:45:48.820 --> 1:45:52.180
 between 1890 and 19 before, I mean, yeah,

1:45:52.180 --> 1:45:56.700
 between like 1888 and 1910.

1:45:56.700 --> 1:45:58.840
 Like nobody really thinks about that period of America,

1:45:58.840 --> 1:46:01.580
 but like that was an entire lifetime for people, right?

1:46:01.580 --> 1:46:03.600
 Like what did they, how did they feel

1:46:03.600 --> 1:46:04.920
 about the country that they were in?

1:46:04.920 --> 1:46:05.760
 That's hilarious.

1:46:05.760 --> 1:46:07.280
 That's how I kind of think about where we are right now.

1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:08.120
 It's funny to think.

1:46:08.120 --> 1:46:09.400
 I mean, I don't want to minimize it,

1:46:09.400 --> 1:46:11.080
 but like we haven't really gone

1:46:11.080 --> 1:46:13.960
 through a World War II style crisis.

1:46:13.960 --> 1:46:17.520
 So like, say that there is a crisis

1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:21.400
 in like several decades of that level, right?

1:46:21.400 --> 1:46:25.040
 Existential risks to a large portion of the world.

1:46:26.160 --> 1:46:29.880
 Then what will be remembered is World War II,

1:46:29.880 --> 1:46:31.600
 maybe a little bit about Vietnam

1:46:32.520 --> 1:46:34.080
 and then whatever that crisis is.

1:46:34.080 --> 1:46:35.960
 And this whole period that we see as dramatic,

1:46:35.960 --> 1:46:37.280
 even coronavirus.

1:46:37.280 --> 1:46:38.120
 Even 9 11.

1:46:38.120 --> 1:46:41.640
 Even 9 11, it's like, cause you can look

1:46:41.640 --> 1:46:43.680
 at how many people died and all those kinds of things,

1:46:43.680 --> 1:46:45.840
 all the drama around the war on terror

1:46:45.840 --> 1:46:47.720
 and all those kinds of things.

1:46:47.720 --> 1:46:49.600
 Maybe Obama will be remembered

1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:52.360
 for being the first African American president,

1:46:52.360 --> 1:46:55.640
 but then like that's, yeah, that's fascinating

1:46:55.640 --> 1:46:59.040
 to think about, oh man, even Trump will be like,

1:46:59.040 --> 1:47:00.600
 oh, okay, cool.

1:47:00.600 --> 1:47:01.440
 That guy.

1:47:01.440 --> 1:47:03.480
 Yeah, like maybe he'd be remembered

1:47:03.480 --> 1:47:08.360
 as the first celebrity.

1:47:08.360 --> 1:47:10.720
 I mean, Reagan was already a governor, right?

1:47:10.720 --> 1:47:14.960
 Yeah, so like the first apolitical celebrity that was,

1:47:14.960 --> 1:47:18.000
 so maybe if there's more celebrities in the future,

1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:19.720
 they'll say that Trump was the first person

1:47:19.720 --> 1:47:23.160
 to pave the way for celebrities to win.

1:47:23.160 --> 1:47:24.880
 Oh man, yeah.

1:47:25.840 --> 1:47:29.040
 And yeah, I still hold that this era

1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:30.560
 will probably be remembered.

1:47:30.560 --> 1:47:34.480
 You know, people say I talk about Elon way too much,

1:47:34.480 --> 1:47:37.840
 but the reality is like, there's not many people

1:47:37.840 --> 1:47:39.560
 that are doing the kind of things he's doing

1:47:39.560 --> 1:47:41.240
 is why I talk about it.

1:47:41.240 --> 1:47:44.760
 I think this era, it's not necessarily Elon and SpaceX,

1:47:44.760 --> 1:47:48.720
 but this era will be remembered by the new,

1:47:48.720 --> 1:47:51.560
 the like of the space exploration,

1:47:51.560 --> 1:47:54.280
 of the commercial of companies getting

1:47:54.280 --> 1:47:57.320
 into space exploration of space travel.

1:47:57.320 --> 1:48:01.760
 And perhaps like artificial intelligence

1:48:01.760 --> 1:48:04.160
 around social media, all those kinds of things,

1:48:04.160 --> 1:48:06.160
 this might be remembered for that.

1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:07.640
 But every, all the political bickering,

1:48:07.640 --> 1:48:11.160
 all that nonsense, that might be very well forgotten.

1:48:11.160 --> 1:48:16.240
 One way to think about it is that the internet is so young.

1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:18.920
 I think about it, so Jeff Jarvis,

1:48:18.920 --> 1:48:20.920
 he's a media scholar I respect.

1:48:20.920 --> 1:48:22.160
 He's not the only person to say this,

1:48:22.160 --> 1:48:23.920
 but many others have, which is that, look,

1:48:23.920 --> 1:48:25.800
 this is kind of like the printing press.

1:48:25.800 --> 1:48:27.680
 There was a whole 30 years war

1:48:27.680 --> 1:48:29.320
 because of the printing press.

1:48:29.320 --> 1:48:31.800
 It took a long time for shit to sort out.

1:48:31.800 --> 1:48:33.200
 I think that's where we're at with the internet.

1:48:33.200 --> 1:48:36.320
 Like at a certain level, it disrupts everything.

1:48:36.320 --> 1:48:37.360
 And that's a good thing.

1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:38.880
 It can be very tumultuous.

1:48:39.880 --> 1:48:41.880
 I never felt like I was living through history

1:48:41.880 --> 1:48:43.080
 until coronavirus.

1:48:43.080 --> 1:48:45.120
 Like, you know, like until we were all locked down,

1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:46.960
 I was like, I'm living through history.

1:48:46.960 --> 1:48:50.400
 Like this, there's this very overused cliche in DC

1:48:50.400 --> 1:48:52.320
 where every comm staffer wants you to think

1:48:52.320 --> 1:48:54.400
 that what their boss just did is history.

1:48:54.400 --> 1:48:56.040
 And I've always been like, this isn't history.

1:48:56.040 --> 1:48:58.320
 This is some like stupid fucking bill, you know, whatever.

1:48:58.320 --> 1:49:00.240
 But like, that was the first time I was like,

1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:03.120
 this is history, like this right here.

1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:06.800
 Well, I was hoping, tragedy aside,

1:49:06.800 --> 1:49:10.800
 that this, I wish the primaries happened during coronavirus

1:49:10.800 --> 1:49:14.000
 so that we, because like, then we can see the,

1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:17.480
 so, okay, here's a bunch of people facing crisis.

1:49:17.480 --> 1:49:20.120
 It's an opportunity for a leader to step up.

1:49:20.120 --> 1:49:22.840
 Like, I still believe the optimistic view

1:49:22.840 --> 1:49:27.520
 is the game theory of like influencers

1:49:27.520 --> 1:49:31.360
 will always be defeated by actual great leaders.

1:49:31.360 --> 1:49:34.200
 So like, maybe the great leaders are rare,

1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:36.800
 but I think they're sufficiently out there

1:49:36.800 --> 1:49:39.880
 that they will step up, especially in moments of crisis.

1:49:39.880 --> 1:49:43.160
 And coronavirus is obviously a crisis

1:49:43.160 --> 1:49:46.920
 where like, you know, mass manufacture of tests,

1:49:48.600 --> 1:49:50.720
 all kinds of infrastructure building

1:49:50.720 --> 1:49:52.520
 that you could have done in 2020,

1:49:52.520 --> 1:49:56.120
 there's so many possibilities for just like bold action.

1:49:56.120 --> 1:50:00.680
 And none of that, even just,

1:50:00.680 --> 1:50:04.800
 forget actually doing the action, advocating for it.

1:50:04.800 --> 1:50:07.800
 Just saying like this, we need to do this.

1:50:07.800 --> 1:50:11.680
 And none of that, like the speeches that Biden made,

1:50:11.680 --> 1:50:14.800
 I don't even remember a single speech that Biden made

1:50:14.800 --> 1:50:17.240
 because there's zero bold, I mean, their strategy

1:50:17.240 --> 1:50:21.480
 was to be quiet and let Donald Trump.

1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:23.040
 Polarize the electorate.

1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:25.480
 Polarize the electorate and hope that results

1:50:25.480 --> 1:50:30.480
 in them winning because of the high unemployment numbers

1:50:30.680 --> 1:50:31.960
 and all those kinds of things,

1:50:31.960 --> 1:50:34.640
 as opposed to like, let's go big,

1:50:34.640 --> 1:50:36.160
 let's go with a big speech.

1:50:36.160 --> 1:50:39.840
 Like, you know, that, yeah,

1:50:39.840 --> 1:50:42.720
 it's a lost opportunity in some sense.

1:50:42.720 --> 1:50:44.280
 So we talked a bunch about politics,

1:50:44.280 --> 1:50:45.960
 but one of the other interesting things

1:50:45.960 --> 1:50:48.440
 is that you're involved with is,

1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:53.200
 or involved with defining the future of as journalism.

1:50:53.200 --> 1:50:55.000
 I suppose you can think of podcasts

1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:56.280
 as a kind of journalism,

1:50:56.280 --> 1:50:58.800
 but also just writing in general,

1:50:58.800 --> 1:51:01.760
 just whatever the hell the future of this thing looks like

1:51:02.800 --> 1:51:05.440
 is up to be defined by people like you.

1:51:05.440 --> 1:51:09.120
 So what do you think is broken about journalism

1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:11.760
 and what do you think is the future of journalism?

1:51:11.760 --> 1:51:14.720
 I think the future of journalism looks much more like

1:51:14.720 --> 1:51:17.120
 what we, you and I are doing here right now.

1:51:17.120 --> 1:51:20.800
 And journalism is gonna be downstream from a culture

1:51:20.800 --> 1:51:22.200
 that can be a good and a bad thing

1:51:22.200 --> 1:51:23.960
 depending on how you look at it.

1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:26.120
 We are gonna look at our media,

1:51:26.120 --> 1:51:29.400
 our media is gonna look much more like it did

1:51:29.400 --> 1:51:31.120
 pre mass media.

1:51:31.120 --> 1:51:35.480
 And the way that I mean that is that back in the 18,

1:51:35.480 --> 1:51:38.040
 in the 1800s in particular,

1:51:38.040 --> 1:51:40.200
 especially after the invention of the telegraph

1:51:40.200 --> 1:51:43.120
 when information itself was known.

1:51:43.120 --> 1:51:46.040
 So for example, like you and I don't need to,

1:51:46.040 --> 1:51:47.800
 let's say you and I are competing journalists.

1:51:47.800 --> 1:51:50.800
 You and I are no longer competing quote unquote

1:51:50.800 --> 1:51:54.120
 to tell the public X event happened.

1:51:54.120 --> 1:51:58.800
 All journalism today is largely explaining

1:51:58.800 --> 1:52:01.280
 why did X happen.

1:52:01.280 --> 1:52:04.400
 And part of the problem with that is that

1:52:04.400 --> 1:52:08.080
 that means that it's all up for partisan interpretation.

1:52:08.080 --> 1:52:09.800
 Now you can say that that's a bad thing.

1:52:09.800 --> 1:52:11.080
 I think it's a great thing

1:52:11.080 --> 1:52:13.680
 because the highest level of literacy

1:52:13.680 --> 1:52:17.040
 and news viewership in America

1:52:17.040 --> 1:52:19.720
 was during the time of yellow journalism,

1:52:19.720 --> 1:52:22.080
 was during the time of partisan journalism.

1:52:22.080 --> 1:52:23.000
 Not a surprise.

1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:25.760
 People like to read the news from people

1:52:25.760 --> 1:52:26.800
 that they agree with.

1:52:26.800 --> 1:52:29.920
 You could say that's bad, echo chambers, et cetera.

1:52:29.920 --> 1:52:31.200
 That's the downside of it.

1:52:31.200 --> 1:52:33.440
 The upside is more people are more educated.

1:52:33.440 --> 1:52:36.520
 More people are interested in the news.

1:52:36.520 --> 1:52:40.000
 So I think the proliferation of mass media,

1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:41.760
 I mean, sorry, of this format

1:52:41.760 --> 1:52:45.920
 of niching, of not just long form.

1:52:45.920 --> 1:52:48.800
 Dude, I do updates on Instagram, which are five minutes.

1:52:48.800 --> 1:52:51.920
 Are you considered like Instagram, almost even Twitter?

1:52:51.920 --> 1:52:53.080
 Oh, of course, Twitter.

1:52:53.080 --> 1:52:54.560
 Twitter is where I get my news from.

1:52:54.560 --> 1:52:55.400
 I don't read the paper.

1:52:55.400 --> 1:52:57.640
 I have literally, Twitter is my news aggregator.

1:52:57.640 --> 1:53:01.160
 It's called my wire where I find out about hard events.

1:53:01.160 --> 1:53:03.280
 Like the president has departed the White House.

1:53:03.280 --> 1:53:04.800
 But not only that, I don't know about you,

1:53:04.800 --> 1:53:06.680
 but I also looked at Twitter

1:53:06.680 --> 1:53:07.880
 to the exact thing you're saying,

1:53:07.880 --> 1:53:09.600
 which is the response to the news,

1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:12.960
 like the thoughtful sounds ridiculous,

1:53:12.960 --> 1:53:15.720
 but you can be pretty thoughtful in a single tweet.

1:53:15.720 --> 1:53:18.480
 If you follow the right people, you can get that.

1:53:18.480 --> 1:53:21.000
 And so that is the future of media,

1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:22.840
 which is that the future of media

1:53:22.840 --> 1:53:27.480
 is it will be much larger amounts of people,

1:53:27.480 --> 1:53:29.520
 which are famous to smaller groups.

1:53:29.520 --> 1:53:32.160
 So Walter Cronkite's never gonna happen again,

1:53:32.160 --> 1:53:34.280
 at least probably within our lifetimes,

1:53:34.280 --> 1:53:37.960
 where everybody in America knows who this guy is.

1:53:37.960 --> 1:53:39.120
 That age is over.

1:53:39.120 --> 1:53:40.400
 I think that's a good thing

1:53:40.400 --> 1:53:42.880
 because now people are gonna get the news

1:53:42.880 --> 1:53:44.760
 from the people that they trust.

1:53:44.760 --> 1:53:46.400
 Yes, some of it will be opinionated.

1:53:46.400 --> 1:53:49.040
 I'm in my program.

1:53:49.040 --> 1:53:53.720
 Crystal and I are like, she's coming from this view.

1:53:53.720 --> 1:53:55.080
 I'm coming from this view.

1:53:55.080 --> 1:53:57.600
 That's our bias when we talk about information

1:53:57.600 --> 1:53:59.120
 and we're gonna talk about the information

1:53:59.120 --> 1:54:00.760
 that we think is important.

1:54:00.760 --> 1:54:02.720
 And it has garnered a large audience.

1:54:02.720 --> 1:54:06.160
 I think that's very much where the future is gonna be.

1:54:06.160 --> 1:54:08.680
 And the reason why I think that's a good thing

1:54:08.680 --> 1:54:13.160
 is because people will be engaged more within it

1:54:13.160 --> 1:54:14.720
 rather than the current system

1:54:14.720 --> 1:54:17.880
 where news is highly concentrated, highly consolidated,

1:54:17.880 --> 1:54:19.080
 has group think,

1:54:19.080 --> 1:54:22.880
 has the same elite production pipeline problem

1:54:22.880 --> 1:54:25.240
 of everybody knows journalists all come

1:54:25.240 --> 1:54:27.240
 from the same socioeconomic background

1:54:27.240 --> 1:54:30.040
 and they all party together here in DC or in New York

1:54:30.040 --> 1:54:31.800
 or in LA or wherever,

1:54:31.800 --> 1:54:33.760
 and they're part of the same monoculture

1:54:33.760 --> 1:54:37.080
 and that affects what they report.

1:54:37.080 --> 1:54:40.480
 This will cause a total dispersion of all of that.

1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:44.600
 The battle of our age is gonna be the guild

1:54:44.600 --> 1:54:46.160
 versus the non guild.

1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:48.120
 So like what we see right now

1:54:48.120 --> 1:54:50.640
 with the New York Times and Clubhouse,

1:54:50.640 --> 1:54:54.880
 this is a very, very, very, very, very intentional thing

1:54:54.880 --> 1:54:55.800
 that is happening,

1:54:55.800 --> 1:54:58.000
 which is that the Times talking

1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:00.320
 about unfettered conversations,

1:55:00.320 --> 1:55:03.120
 that's happening on Clubhouse for people who aren't aware.

1:55:03.120 --> 1:55:06.280
 This is important because they need

1:55:06.280 --> 1:55:08.880
 to be the fetters of conversation.

1:55:08.880 --> 1:55:11.600
 They need to be the inter agent.

1:55:11.600 --> 1:55:12.760
 That's where they get their power.

1:55:12.760 --> 1:55:15.520
 They get their power from convincing Facebook

1:55:15.520 --> 1:55:18.480
 that they are the ones who can fact check stuff.

1:55:18.480 --> 1:55:20.760
 They are the ones who can tell you

1:55:20.760 --> 1:55:23.160
 whether something is right or wrong.

1:55:23.160 --> 1:55:27.120
 That battle over unimpeded conversation

1:55:27.120 --> 1:55:28.640
 and the explosion of a format

1:55:28.640 --> 1:55:30.400
 that you and I are doing really well in,

1:55:30.400 --> 1:55:32.680
 and then this more consolidated one,

1:55:32.680 --> 1:55:35.280
 which holds cultural power and elite power

1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:37.240
 and more importantly, money, right?

1:55:37.240 --> 1:55:39.240
 Over you and I, that's the battle

1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:40.080
 that we're all gonna play out.

1:55:40.080 --> 1:55:41.800
 Do you think unfettered conversations

1:55:41.800 --> 1:55:43.640
 have a chance to win this battle?

1:55:43.640 --> 1:55:45.360
 Yes, I do in the long run.

1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:48.440
 In the long run, the internet is simply too powerful.

1:55:48.440 --> 1:55:50.720
 But here's the mistake everybody makes.

1:55:50.720 --> 1:55:52.200
 The New York Times will never lose.

1:55:52.200 --> 1:55:53.740
 It will just become one of us.

1:55:53.740 --> 1:55:54.580
 See.

1:55:54.580 --> 1:55:55.400
 You think so?

1:55:55.400 --> 1:55:56.240
 They already are.

1:55:56.240 --> 1:55:57.080
 They are the largest.

1:55:57.080 --> 1:55:57.900
 The daily?

1:55:57.900 --> 1:55:58.760
 The daily, look at the daily.

1:55:58.760 --> 1:55:59.640
 Not even that.

1:55:59.640 --> 1:56:01.200
 Think about it not in podcasting.

1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:04.720
 The Times is not a mass media product.

1:56:04.720 --> 1:56:06.960
 It is a subscription product

1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:10.080
 for upper middle class largely white liberals

1:56:10.080 --> 1:56:12.800
 who live the same circumstances

1:56:12.800 --> 1:56:15.400
 across the United States and in Europe.

1:56:15.400 --> 1:56:16.880
 There's nothing wrong with that.

1:56:16.880 --> 1:56:17.880
 But here's the thing.

1:56:17.880 --> 1:56:19.660
 You can't be the paper of record

1:56:19.660 --> 1:56:21.560
 when you're actually the paper

1:56:21.560 --> 1:56:23.520
 of upper middle class white America.

1:56:23.520 --> 1:56:27.000
 Your job is to report on the news from that angle

1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:29.040
 and deliver them the product that they want.

1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:30.540
 There's nothing wrong with that.

1:56:30.540 --> 1:56:32.560
 Their stock price is higher than ever.

1:56:32.560 --> 1:56:35.000
 They're making 10 times more money than they did

1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:38.580
 10 years ago, but it comes at the cost

1:56:38.580 --> 1:56:41.520
 of not having a mass application audience.

1:56:41.520 --> 1:56:44.200
 So like when people, I think people in our space

1:56:44.200 --> 1:56:46.280
 are always like, the New York Times is gonna be destroyed.

1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:48.640
 No, it's actually even better.

1:56:48.640 --> 1:56:50.560
 They will just become one of us.

1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:51.480
 They already are.

1:56:51.480 --> 1:56:53.080
 They're a subscription platform.

1:56:53.080 --> 1:56:54.880
 Well, yes, in terms of the actual mechanism.

1:56:54.880 --> 1:56:58.000
 But you know, New York Times is still,

1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:00.400
 and I don't think I'm speaking about a particular sector.

1:57:00.400 --> 1:57:05.400
 I think it, as a brand, it does have the level

1:57:06.020 --> 1:57:08.680
 of credibility assigned to it still.

1:57:08.680 --> 1:57:10.600
 There's politicization of it.

1:57:10.600 --> 1:57:11.440
 Totally.

1:57:11.440 --> 1:57:13.740
 But there's a credibility.

1:57:13.740 --> 1:57:16.480
 Like it has much more credibility than,

1:57:16.480 --> 1:57:18.800
 forgive me, than I think you and I have.

1:57:18.800 --> 1:57:19.640
 No, you're right.

1:57:19.640 --> 1:57:23.480
 In terms of your podcast, like people are not going

1:57:23.480 --> 1:57:27.800
 to be like, they're gonna say at the New York Times

1:57:27.800 --> 1:57:32.800
 versus what you said on the podcast for an opinion.

1:57:33.120 --> 1:57:35.320
 I wonder in the sense of battles,

1:57:35.320 --> 1:57:37.800
 whether on Federated Conversations, whether Joe Rogan,

1:57:37.800 --> 1:57:41.840
 whether your podcast can become the,

1:57:41.840 --> 1:57:45.280
 have the same level of legitimacy or the flip side,

1:57:45.280 --> 1:57:49.640
 New York Times loses legitimacy to be at the same level

1:57:49.640 --> 1:57:52.640
 of in terms of how we talk about it.

1:57:52.640 --> 1:57:54.480
 It's a long battle, right?

1:57:54.480 --> 1:57:55.880
 It's gonna take a long time.

1:57:55.880 --> 1:57:58.240
 And I'm saying, this is where I think the end state is going

1:57:58.240 --> 1:57:59.520
 and look at what the Times is doing.

1:57:59.520 --> 1:58:01.960
 They're leaning into podcasting for a reason,

1:58:01.960 --> 1:58:06.160
 but not just podcasting as in NPR level,

1:58:06.160 --> 1:58:07.700
 like here's what's happening.

1:58:07.700 --> 1:58:10.320
 Michael Barbaro is a fucking celebrity, right?

1:58:10.320 --> 1:58:11.720
 The guy who does the daily.

1:58:11.720 --> 1:58:14.900
 That guy's famous amongst these people

1:58:14.900 --> 1:58:16.840
 because they're like, oh my God, I love Michael.

1:58:16.840 --> 1:58:18.200
 Like, I love the way he does this stuff.

1:58:18.200 --> 1:58:19.360
 Again, that's fine.

1:58:19.360 --> 1:58:20.680
 More people are listening to the news.

1:58:20.680 --> 1:58:22.160
 I think that's a good thing.

1:58:22.160 --> 1:58:23.680
 And then who else do they hire?

1:58:23.680 --> 1:58:27.520
 Ezra Klein from Vox, Kara Swisher, also from Vox,

1:58:27.520 --> 1:58:30.360
 who does Pivot, which is an amazing podcast.

1:58:30.360 --> 1:58:32.640
 Or Jane Coaston, same thing.

1:58:32.640 --> 1:58:36.280
 It's personalities who are becoming bundled together

1:58:36.280 --> 1:58:38.200
 within this brand, right?

1:58:38.200 --> 1:58:40.880
 Here's, okay, maybe I'm just a hater.

1:58:42.760 --> 1:58:45.240
 Cause I love podcasting from the beginning.

1:58:45.240 --> 1:58:48.420
 I love Green Day before the recall, man.

1:58:48.420 --> 1:58:50.580
 But I am bothered by it.

1:58:50.580 --> 1:58:53.400
 Like why doesn't Kara Swisher, she's done successfully.

1:58:53.400 --> 1:58:55.600
 I think in her own, no, she was always a part

1:58:55.600 --> 1:58:56.680
 of some kind of institution.

1:58:56.680 --> 1:58:57.600
 I'm not sure.

1:58:57.600 --> 1:59:00.080
 But she started her own thing, I think.

1:59:00.080 --> 1:59:00.920
 It would.

1:59:00.920 --> 1:59:01.920
 Recode, right, yeah.

1:59:01.920 --> 1:59:03.520
 Recode, I don't know if that's her own thing.

1:59:03.520 --> 1:59:04.360
 Yeah, yeah.

1:59:04.360 --> 1:59:06.200
 So she was very successful there.

1:59:06.200 --> 1:59:08.780
 Why the hell did she join the New York Times

1:59:08.780 --> 1:59:09.920
 with the new podcast?

1:59:09.920 --> 1:59:13.120
 Why is Michael Barbaro not do his own thing?

1:59:13.120 --> 1:59:14.920
 Cause he gets paid and because he has,

1:59:14.920 --> 1:59:17.800
 he wants the elite cache that you just referenced

1:59:17.800 --> 1:59:19.880
 within his social circle in New York,

1:59:19.880 --> 1:59:21.960
 which is that I think the biggest mistake

1:59:21.960 --> 1:59:23.880
 that some of the venture people make is

1:59:23.880 --> 1:59:25.780
 if we give everybody the tools

1:59:25.780 --> 1:59:27.600
 that those people are all gonna leave

1:59:27.600 --> 1:59:29.660
 to like go substack and go independent,

1:59:29.660 --> 1:59:31.440
 within their social circle,

1:59:31.440 --> 1:59:35.600
 sacrificing some money from being independent is worth it

1:59:35.600 --> 1:59:38.060
 to be a part of the New York Times.

1:59:38.060 --> 1:59:43.060
 That's sad to me because it propagates old thinking,

1:59:43.140 --> 1:59:46.400
 like it propagates old institutions.

1:59:46.400 --> 1:59:47.800
 And you could say that New York Times

1:59:47.800 --> 1:59:49.700
 is going to evolve quickly and so on,

1:59:49.700 --> 1:59:54.200
 but I would love it if there was a mechanism

1:59:54.200 --> 1:59:57.360
 for reestablishing, like for building new New York Times

1:59:58.360 --> 1:59:59.960
 in terms of public legitimacy.

1:59:59.960 --> 2:00:02.320
 And I suppose that's a wishful thinking

2:00:02.320 --> 2:00:06.360
 cause it takes time to build trust in institutions

2:00:06.360 --> 2:00:08.440
 and it takes time to build new institutions.

2:00:08.440 --> 2:00:10.560
 My main thing I would say is public legitimacy

2:00:10.560 --> 2:00:13.220
 as a concept is not gonna be there in mass media anymore

2:00:13.220 --> 2:00:15.960
 because of the balkanization of audiences.

2:00:15.960 --> 2:00:16.920
 I mean, think about it, right?

2:00:16.920 --> 2:00:20.320
 Like this is like Lesion, the classic stuff

2:00:20.320 --> 2:00:21.920
 around a thousand true fans,

2:00:21.920 --> 2:00:24.500
 or no, sorry, like a hundred true fans even now.

2:00:24.500 --> 2:00:26.000
 Like you can make a living on the internet

2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:27.600
 just talking to a hundred people.

2:00:27.600 --> 2:00:29.400
 If as long as they're all high frequency traders,

2:00:29.400 --> 2:00:32.480
 some of the highest paid people on substack,

2:00:32.480 --> 2:00:34.240
 they don't have that many subs.

2:00:34.240 --> 2:00:36.080
 It's just that they're Wall Street guys, right?

2:00:36.080 --> 2:00:37.160
 So people pay a lot of money.

2:00:37.160 --> 2:00:38.640
 Again, that's great.

2:00:38.640 --> 2:00:42.060
 So what you will have is an increasing balkanization

2:00:42.060 --> 2:00:46.120
 of the internet, of audiences and of niches.

2:00:46.120 --> 2:00:48.680
 People will become increasingly famous within us.

2:00:48.680 --> 2:00:51.040
 You will become astoundingly famous.

2:00:51.040 --> 2:00:52.480
 I'm sure you've noticed this with your fan base.

2:00:52.480 --> 2:00:53.400
 I certainly have with mine.

2:00:53.400 --> 2:00:56.040
 Like 99% of people have no idea who I am,

2:00:56.040 --> 2:00:57.000
 but when somebody meets, they're like,

2:00:57.000 --> 2:01:01.080
 oh my God, I watch your show every day, right?

2:01:01.080 --> 2:01:04.100
 Like it's the only thing I watch for news, right?

2:01:04.100 --> 2:01:07.000
 Like instead of casually famous, if that makes sense,

2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:09.400
 but like, oh yeah, it's like Alec Baldwin, you know?

2:01:09.400 --> 2:01:10.640
 Whoa, shit, that's Alec Baldwin.

2:01:10.640 --> 2:01:14.240
 But you're not like, oh shit, I love you Alec Baldwin.

2:01:14.240 --> 2:01:16.840
 This is a Ben Smith of the New York Times,

2:01:16.840 --> 2:01:17.800
 actually he wrote this column.

2:01:17.800 --> 2:01:20.180
 He's like, the future is everybody will be famous,

2:01:20.180 --> 2:01:22.760
 but only to a small group of people.

2:01:22.760 --> 2:01:24.160
 And I think that is true.

2:01:24.160 --> 2:01:26.120
 But again, I don't decry it.

2:01:26.120 --> 2:01:28.440
 I think it's great because I think that the more

2:01:28.440 --> 2:01:31.000
 that that happens, the more engaged people will be

2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:34.560
 and it empowers different voices to be able to come in

2:01:34.560 --> 2:01:36.520
 and then possibly, I wouldn't say destroy,

2:01:36.520 --> 2:01:37.960
 but compete against.

2:01:37.960 --> 2:01:39.200
 I mean, look at Joe.

2:01:39.200 --> 2:01:44.040
 Joe is more powerful than CNN and MSNBC and Fox

2:01:44.040 --> 2:01:45.100
 all put together.

2:01:45.100 --> 2:01:47.560
 That gives me like immense inspiration.

2:01:47.560 --> 2:01:50.040
 Like he created the space for me to succeed.

2:01:50.040 --> 2:01:52.360
 And I told him that when I met him, I was like,

2:01:52.360 --> 2:01:55.480
 dude, like I listened to his podcast when I was like young.

2:01:55.480 --> 2:01:58.020
 And like, and I remember like when I got to meet him

2:01:58.020 --> 2:02:00.280
 and all that, and I told him this on this pod,

2:02:00.280 --> 2:02:02.840
 I was like, I didn't know people were millions

2:02:02.840 --> 2:02:05.380
 were willing to listen to a guy talk about chimps

2:02:05.380 --> 2:02:08.080
 for three straight hours, including me.

2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:09.760
 I didn't know that I could be one of those people.

2:02:09.760 --> 2:02:10.600
 Yeah, me too.

2:02:10.600 --> 2:02:12.760
 I learned something about myself from his show, yeah.

2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:16.000
 And so by creating that space, I'd be like, wait,

2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:17.460
 there's a hunger here.

2:02:17.460 --> 2:02:20.240
 Like he showed us all the way

2:02:20.240 --> 2:02:22.400
 and none of us will ever again be as famous as Rogan

2:02:22.400 --> 2:02:24.680
 because he was the first and that's fine

2:02:24.680 --> 2:02:27.460
 because he created the umbrella ecosystem

2:02:27.460 --> 2:02:29.100
 for us all to thrive.

2:02:29.100 --> 2:02:32.400
 That is where I see like a great amount of hope

2:02:32.400 --> 2:02:33.420
 within that story.

2:02:33.420 --> 2:02:35.880
 Yeah, and the cool thing, he also supports that ecosystem.

2:02:35.880 --> 2:02:38.160
 He's such a. He's so generous.

2:02:38.160 --> 2:02:40.960
 One of the things he paved the way out for me

2:02:40.960 --> 2:02:45.960
 is to show that you can just be honest, publicly honest,

2:02:47.420 --> 2:02:51.320
 and not jealous of other people's success,

2:02:51.320 --> 2:02:54.620
 but instead be supportive and all those kinds of things,

2:02:54.620 --> 2:02:56.140
 just like loving towards others.

2:02:56.140 --> 2:02:57.360
 He's been an inspiration.

2:02:57.360 --> 2:03:01.280
 I mean, to the comics community,

2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:04.520
 I think there are a bunch of, before that,

2:03:04.520 --> 2:03:06.920
 I think there were all a bunch of competitive haters

2:03:06.920 --> 2:03:07.760
 towards each other.

2:03:07.760 --> 2:03:11.240
 Yeah, and now he's like just injected love.

2:03:11.240 --> 2:03:13.600
 They're like, they're still like many are still resistant,

2:03:13.600 --> 2:03:15.080
 but they're like, they can't help it

2:03:15.080 --> 2:03:17.120
 because he's such a huge voice.

2:03:17.120 --> 2:03:20.160
 He like forces them to be like loving towards each other.

2:03:20.160 --> 2:03:22.420
 And the same, I tried to,

2:03:22.420 --> 2:03:26.160
 one of the reasons I wanted to start this podcast

2:03:26.160 --> 2:03:31.160
 was to try to, I wanted to be like do what Joe Rogan did,

2:03:31.560 --> 2:03:33.920
 but for the scientific community,

2:03:33.920 --> 2:03:37.000
 like my little circle of scientific community of like,

2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:38.580
 like let's support each other.

2:03:38.580 --> 2:03:40.360
 Yeah, well, like Avi Loeb,

2:03:40.360 --> 2:03:42.880
 I would have no idea who he was if it wasn't for you.

2:03:42.880 --> 2:03:44.880
 I mean, I assume you put him in touch with Joe.

2:03:44.880 --> 2:03:45.720
 He went on Joe's show.

2:03:45.720 --> 2:03:46.960
 I had him on my show.

2:03:46.960 --> 2:03:49.520
 Like millions of people would have no idea who he was

2:03:49.520 --> 2:03:50.360
 if it wasn't for you.

2:03:50.360 --> 2:03:51.960
 Just by the way, in terms of deep state

2:03:51.960 --> 2:03:54.760
 and shadow government, Avi Loeb has to do with aliens.

2:03:54.760 --> 2:03:56.760
 You better believe Joe.

2:03:56.760 --> 2:03:58.400
 Dude, the last thing I sent to him

2:03:58.400 --> 2:04:00.500
 was the American Airlines audio.

2:04:00.500 --> 2:04:02.120
 Did you see that?

2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:04.960
 The pilots who were, oh my God, dude, this is amazing.

2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:09.240
 So like, this American Airlines flight crew

2:04:09.240 --> 2:04:12.240
 was over New Mexico, this happened five or six days ago.

2:04:12.240 --> 2:04:14.400
 And the guy comes and he goes,

2:04:14.400 --> 2:04:16.320
 hey, do you have any targets up here?

2:04:16.320 --> 2:04:20.560
 A large cylindrical object just flew over me.

2:04:20.560 --> 2:04:23.200
 Okay, so this happens, so this happens.

2:04:23.200 --> 2:04:26.520
 Then a guy or like a radio catcher

2:04:26.520 --> 2:04:28.960
 records this and posts it online.

2:04:28.960 --> 2:04:33.440
 American Airlines confirms that this is authentic audio.

2:04:33.440 --> 2:04:35.400
 And they go, all further questions

2:04:35.400 --> 2:04:37.120
 should be referred to the FBI.

2:04:37.120 --> 2:04:39.760
 So then, okay, American Airlines just confirmed

2:04:39.760 --> 2:04:41.520
 it's a legitimate transmission.

2:04:41.520 --> 2:04:45.760
 FBI, then the FAA comes out and says,

2:04:45.760 --> 2:04:50.760
 we were tracking no objects in the vicinity of this plane

2:04:51.040 --> 2:04:52.480
 at the time of the transmission.

2:04:52.480 --> 2:04:55.480
 So the only plausible explanation that online sleuths

2:04:55.480 --> 2:04:58.840
 have been able to say is maybe he saw a Learjet,

2:04:58.840 --> 2:05:02.200
 which was, you know, using like open source data.

2:05:02.200 --> 2:05:03.960
 FAA rules that out.

2:05:03.960 --> 2:05:05.280
 So what was it?

2:05:05.280 --> 2:05:07.380
 He saw a large cylindrical object.

2:05:07.380 --> 2:05:09.680
 While he was mid flight, American Airlines,

2:05:09.680 --> 2:05:12.960
 but you can go online, listen to the audio yourself.

2:05:12.960 --> 2:05:15.680
 This is a 100% no shit transmission

2:05:15.680 --> 2:05:19.820
 confirmed by American Airlines of a commercial pilot

2:05:19.820 --> 2:05:23.200
 over New Mexico, seeing a quote unquote,

2:05:23.200 --> 2:05:26.040
 large cylindrical object in the air.

2:05:26.040 --> 2:05:28.200
 Like I said, when we first started talking,

2:05:28.200 --> 2:05:31.160
 I've never believed more in UFOs and aliens.

2:05:31.160 --> 2:05:33.200
 Yeah, this is awesome.

2:05:33.200 --> 2:05:37.520
 I just wish both American Airlines, FBI,

2:05:37.520 --> 2:05:40.000
 and government would be more transparent.

2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:43.280
 Like there would be voices, and I know it sounds ridiculous,

2:05:43.280 --> 2:05:45.280
 but the kind of transparency that you see,

2:05:45.280 --> 2:05:48.920
 maybe not Joe Rogan, he's like overly transparent.

2:05:48.920 --> 2:05:52.440
 He's just a comic really, but just the, I don't know,

2:05:52.440 --> 2:05:56.480
 like a podcast from the FBI, just like being honest,

2:05:56.480 --> 2:05:58.980
 like excited, confused.

2:05:58.980 --> 2:06:03.120
 I'm sure that they're being overly cautious

2:06:03.120 --> 2:06:04.520
 about their release information.

2:06:04.520 --> 2:06:05.960
 I'm sure there's a lot of information

2:06:05.960 --> 2:06:07.560
 that would inspire the public,

2:06:07.560 --> 2:06:09.500
 that would inspire trust in institutions

2:06:09.500 --> 2:06:12.320
 that will not damage national security.

2:06:12.320 --> 2:06:14.240
 Like it seems to me obvious,

2:06:14.240 --> 2:06:15.480
 and the reason they're not sharing it

2:06:15.480 --> 2:06:17.800
 is because of this momentum of bureaucracy,

2:06:17.800 --> 2:06:19.380
 of caution and so on.

2:06:19.380 --> 2:06:21.560
 But there's probably so much cool information

2:06:21.560 --> 2:06:22.720
 that the government has.

2:06:22.720 --> 2:06:26.620
 The way I almost, I wouldn't say it confirmed it's real,

2:06:26.620 --> 2:06:28.960
 but Trump didn't declassify it.

2:06:28.960 --> 2:06:31.320
 Like you know that if there was ever a president

2:06:31.320 --> 2:06:34.800
 that actually wanted to get to the bottom of it, it was him.

2:06:34.800 --> 2:06:37.120
 I mean, he didn't declassify it, man.

2:06:37.120 --> 2:06:38.400
 And people begged him to.

2:06:38.400 --> 2:06:39.720
 I know for a fact,

2:06:39.720 --> 2:06:41.960
 because I pushed to try and make this happen,

2:06:41.960 --> 2:06:44.360
 that some people did speak to him about it.

2:06:44.360 --> 2:06:46.400
 And he was like, no, I'm not gonna do it.

2:06:46.400 --> 2:06:47.240
 So.

2:06:47.240 --> 2:06:48.560
 He might be afraid.

2:06:48.560 --> 2:06:49.720
 That's what I mean, though.

2:06:49.720 --> 2:06:50.640
 They were probably all telling him,

2:06:50.640 --> 2:06:52.480
 they're like, sir, you can't do this, you know, all this,

2:06:52.480 --> 2:06:53.780
 like, wow, and I get that.

2:06:53.780 --> 2:06:56.400
 And there's this legislation written at COVID

2:06:56.400 --> 2:06:58.640
 that like they have six months to release it, man.

2:06:58.640 --> 2:06:59.480
 Is that real?

2:06:59.480 --> 2:07:00.320
 What is that?

2:07:00.320 --> 2:07:01.140
 Is that a bunch of bullshit?

2:07:01.140 --> 2:07:01.980
 I think it's bullshit.

2:07:01.980 --> 2:07:04.280
 There's so many different levels of classification

2:07:04.280 --> 2:07:05.840
 that people need to understand.

2:07:05.840 --> 2:07:07.960
 I mean, look, I read John Podesta.

2:07:07.960 --> 2:07:10.320
 He was the chief of staff to Bill Clinton.

2:07:10.320 --> 2:07:11.560
 He's a big UFO guy.

2:07:11.560 --> 2:07:12.960
 He tried.

2:07:12.960 --> 2:07:15.920
 Like him and Clinton tried to get some of this information

2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:17.880
 and they could not get any of it.

2:07:17.880 --> 2:07:19.680
 And we're talking about the president

2:07:19.680 --> 2:07:21.340
 and the White House chief of staff.

2:07:21.340 --> 2:07:22.560
 Well, there's a whole bureaucracy,

2:07:22.560 --> 2:07:24.640
 but just like you were saying, with intent.

2:07:24.640 --> 2:07:27.080
 You have to be like, that has to be your focus

2:07:27.080 --> 2:07:29.840
 because there's a whole bureaucracy built around secrecy

2:07:29.840 --> 2:07:31.160
 for probably for a good reason.

2:07:31.160 --> 2:07:33.740
 So to get through to the information,

2:07:33.740 --> 2:07:35.440
 there's a whole like paperwork process,

2:07:35.440 --> 2:07:36.280
 all that kind of stuff.

2:07:36.280 --> 2:07:37.880
 You can't just walk in and get the,

2:07:37.880 --> 2:07:40.960
 unless again, with intention, that becomes your thing.

2:07:40.960 --> 2:07:43.040
 Like let's revolutionize this thing.

2:07:43.960 --> 2:07:45.920
 And then you get only so many things.

2:07:45.920 --> 2:07:50.800
 It's sad that the bureaucracy has gotten so bulky,

2:07:50.800 --> 2:07:53.040
 but I think the hopeful messages

2:07:53.040 --> 2:07:54.400
 from earlier in our conversation,

2:07:54.400 --> 2:07:57.760
 it seems like a single person can't fix it,

2:07:57.760 --> 2:08:01.960
 but if you hire the right team, it feels like you can.

2:08:01.960 --> 2:08:03.000
 Can't fix everything.

2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:05.540
 I don't wanna give people unrealistic expectations.

2:08:05.540 --> 2:08:07.940
 You can fix a lot, especially in crisis,

2:08:07.940 --> 2:08:09.200
 you can remake America.

2:08:09.200 --> 2:08:10.040
 Yeah.

2:08:10.040 --> 2:08:10.860
 And the reason I know that

2:08:10.860 --> 2:08:12.560
 is because it's already happened twice.

2:08:12.560 --> 2:08:17.400
 FDR, or in modern history, FDR and JFK.

2:08:17.400 --> 2:08:20.880
 Sorry, FDR and JFK's assassination, LBJ.

2:08:20.880 --> 2:08:25.480
 Two hyper competent men who understood government,

2:08:25.480 --> 2:08:27.120
 who understood personnel,

2:08:27.120 --> 2:08:28.440
 and coincidentally were friends.

2:08:28.440 --> 2:08:29.280
 I love this.

2:08:29.280 --> 2:08:31.000
 I don't think actually people understand this.

2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:36.000
 FDR met Johnson three days after he won his election

2:08:37.520 --> 2:08:38.560
 to Congress, special election.

2:08:38.560 --> 2:08:40.300
 He was only 29 years old.

2:08:40.300 --> 2:08:44.220
 And he left that meeting and called somebody and said,

2:08:44.220 --> 2:08:45.640
 this young man is gonna be president

2:08:45.640 --> 2:08:46.920
 of the United States someday.

2:08:46.920 --> 2:08:50.080
 Like even then, like what was within him

2:08:50.080 --> 2:08:51.800
 to understand and to recognize that.

2:08:51.800 --> 2:08:54.360
 And sometimes Johnson, as a young member of Congress,

2:08:54.360 --> 2:08:56.280
 would come and have breakfast with FDR,

2:08:56.280 --> 2:09:00.080
 like just to the great political minds of the 20th century,

2:09:00.080 --> 2:09:01.320
 just sitting there talking.

2:09:01.320 --> 2:09:04.720
 Like I would give anything to know what was happening.

2:09:04.720 --> 2:09:06.320
 Yeah, I hope they were real with each other.

2:09:06.320 --> 2:09:08.480
 And there was like a genuine human connection, right?

2:09:08.480 --> 2:09:09.960
 That seems to be the...

2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:11.400
 Well, Johnson wasn't a genuine guy,

2:09:11.400 --> 2:09:13.540
 so probably certainly not.

2:09:13.540 --> 2:09:16.460
 Well, I need to read those thousands of pages.

2:09:16.460 --> 2:09:19.700
 I've been way too focused on Hitler.

2:09:20.800 --> 2:09:22.880
 I was gonna say, one of my goals in coming to this

2:09:22.880 --> 2:09:24.560
 is I was like, I gotta get Lex into two things,

2:09:24.560 --> 2:09:25.600
 because I know he'll love it.

2:09:25.600 --> 2:09:27.320
 I know he'll love LBJ,

2:09:27.320 --> 2:09:29.240
 if he takes the time to read the books.

2:09:29.240 --> 2:09:30.080
 Really?

2:09:30.080 --> 2:09:31.160
 100%.

2:09:31.160 --> 2:09:32.000
 He's the most...

2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:32.820
 Of all the presidents...

2:09:32.820 --> 2:09:33.680
 I didn't say you'll love him,

2:09:33.680 --> 2:09:34.960
 but you'll love the books about him.

2:09:34.960 --> 2:09:37.520
 Because the books are a story of America,

2:09:37.520 --> 2:09:39.600
 the story of politics, the story of power.

2:09:39.600 --> 2:09:41.280
 This is the guy who wrote the Power Broker.

2:09:41.280 --> 2:09:44.000
 These books are up there with

2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:47.040
 Decline and Follow the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon,

2:09:47.040 --> 2:09:48.840
 in terms of how power works.

2:09:48.840 --> 2:09:49.780
 Study of power.

2:09:49.780 --> 2:09:50.620
 Exactly.

2:09:50.620 --> 2:09:52.880
 No, that's why Carroll wrote the books.

2:09:52.880 --> 2:09:55.600
 And that's why the books are not really about LBJ,

2:09:55.600 --> 2:09:57.560
 they're about power in Washington,

2:09:57.560 --> 2:10:00.200
 and about the consolidation of power post New Deal,

2:10:00.200 --> 2:10:01.760
 the consolidation then,

2:10:01.760 --> 2:10:04.640
 where they're using the levers of power like Johnson knew

2:10:04.640 --> 2:10:07.980
 in order to change the House of Representatives,

2:10:07.980 --> 2:10:09.520
 the Senate of the United States,

2:10:09.520 --> 2:10:11.480
 and ultimately the presidency of the United States,

2:10:11.480 --> 2:10:13.920
 which ended in failure and disaster with Vietnam.

2:10:13.920 --> 2:10:14.960
 Don't get me wrong.

2:10:14.960 --> 2:10:18.860
 But he's overlooked for so many of the incredible things

2:10:18.860 --> 2:10:19.960
 that he did with civil rights.

2:10:19.960 --> 2:10:21.520
 Nobody else could have done it.

2:10:21.520 --> 2:10:23.960
 No one else could have gotten it done.

2:10:23.960 --> 2:10:25.320
 And the second thing is,

2:10:25.320 --> 2:10:27.280
 we gotta get you into World War I.

2:10:27.280 --> 2:10:29.640
 We gotta get you more into World War I,

2:10:29.640 --> 2:10:31.860
 because I think that's a rabbit hole,

2:10:31.860 --> 2:10:33.600
 which I know you're a Dan Carlin fan.

2:10:33.600 --> 2:10:35.320
 So blueprint for Armageddon.

2:10:35.320 --> 2:10:36.160
 Yeah, it's good.

2:10:36.160 --> 2:10:36.980
 Guaranteed.

2:10:36.980 --> 2:10:37.820
 But...

2:10:37.820 --> 2:10:39.980
 But there's fewer evil people there.

2:10:39.980 --> 2:10:41.560
 Yes, but...

2:10:41.560 --> 2:10:43.720
 But that's what actually...

2:10:43.720 --> 2:10:45.520
 There's a banality of that evil,

2:10:45.520 --> 2:10:50.240
 of the Kaiser and of the Austro Hungarians.

2:10:50.240 --> 2:10:51.120
 And of...

2:10:51.120 --> 2:10:54.440
 See, I like World War I more because it was unresolved.

2:10:54.440 --> 2:10:56.040
 It's one of those periods I was talking to you about,

2:10:56.040 --> 2:10:58.840
 about sometimes you're called and you fail.

2:10:58.840 --> 2:10:59.680
 That's what happened.

2:10:59.680 --> 2:11:02.240
 I mean, 50 million people were killed

2:11:02.240 --> 2:11:03.960
 in the most horrific way.

2:11:03.960 --> 2:11:06.400
 People literally drowned in the mud,

2:11:06.400 --> 2:11:09.220
 like an entire generation.

2:11:09.220 --> 2:11:11.600
 One stat I love is that,

2:11:11.600 --> 2:11:14.760
 Britain didn't need a draft till 1916.

2:11:14.760 --> 2:11:18.000
 Like they went two years of throwing people

2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:20.620
 into barbed wire voluntarily.

2:11:20.620 --> 2:11:22.640
 And because people love their country

2:11:22.640 --> 2:11:23.800
 and they love the king,

2:11:23.800 --> 2:11:26.320
 and they thought they were going against the Kaiser.

2:11:26.320 --> 2:11:28.480
 It's just like that conflict to me,

2:11:28.480 --> 2:11:30.160
 I just can't read enough about it.

2:11:30.160 --> 2:11:33.320
 Also just like births Russian Revolution, you know.

2:11:33.320 --> 2:11:34.160
 Yeah, I mean...

2:11:34.160 --> 2:11:35.000
 Hitler.

2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:37.000
 You can't talk about World War II without World War I.

2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:37.840
 Right.

2:11:37.840 --> 2:11:39.200
 And I'm obsessed with the conflict.

2:11:39.200 --> 2:11:40.800
 I've read way too many books about it.

2:11:40.800 --> 2:11:42.880
 For this reason is, it's unresolved.

2:11:42.880 --> 2:11:46.160
 And like the roots of so much of even our current problems

2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:47.800
 are happened in Versailles, right?

2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:51.720
 Like Vietnam is because of the Treaty of Versailles.

2:11:51.720 --> 2:11:53.460
 Many ways the Middle Eastern problems

2:11:53.460 --> 2:11:55.300
 and the division of the states there.

2:11:55.300 --> 2:11:56.520
 The Treaty of Versailles

2:11:56.520 --> 2:11:58.760
 in terms of the penalties against Germany.

2:11:58.760 --> 2:12:01.780
 But also they fall out from those wars

2:12:01.780 --> 2:12:03.900
 on the French and the German population,

2:12:03.900 --> 2:12:05.360
 or the French and the British populations

2:12:05.360 --> 2:12:10.240
 and their reluctance for war in 1939 or 1938.

2:12:10.240 --> 2:12:12.320
 When Neville Chamberlain goes, right?

2:12:12.320 --> 2:12:14.040
 Like that's one of the things people don't understand

2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:16.500
 is the actual appetite of the British public at that time.

2:12:16.500 --> 2:12:17.720
 They didn't want to go to war.

2:12:17.720 --> 2:12:19.240
 Only Churchill, he was the only one

2:12:19.240 --> 2:12:21.480
 in the gathering storm, right?

2:12:21.480 --> 2:12:24.940
 Like being like, hey, this is really bad and all of that.

2:12:24.940 --> 2:12:26.440
 And then even in the United States,

2:12:26.440 --> 2:12:28.820
 our streak of isolationism, which sweat.

2:12:28.820 --> 2:12:32.080
 I mean, things were because of that conflict.

2:12:32.080 --> 2:12:34.720
 We were convinced as a country

2:12:34.720 --> 2:12:37.960
 that we wanted nothing to do with Europe and its problems.

2:12:37.960 --> 2:12:39.460
 And in many ways that contributed

2:12:39.460 --> 2:12:41.280
 to the proliferation of Hitler and more.

2:12:41.280 --> 2:12:43.940
 So like I'm obsessed with World War I for this reason,

2:12:43.940 --> 2:12:46.040
 which is that it's just like the root.

2:12:46.040 --> 2:12:48.620
 It's like the culmination of the monarchies,

2:12:48.620 --> 2:12:52.080
 then the fall, and then just all the shit spills out

2:12:52.080 --> 2:12:53.600
 from there for like a hundred years.

2:12:53.600 --> 2:12:56.260
 So World War I is like the most important shift

2:12:56.260 --> 2:12:58.680
 in human history versus World War II

2:12:58.680 --> 2:13:00.400
 is like a consequence of that.

2:13:00.400 --> 2:13:03.040
 Yeah, so I have a degree in security studies

2:13:03.040 --> 2:13:03.880
 from Georgetown.

2:13:03.880 --> 2:13:06.120
 And one of the thing is that we would focus a lot on that

2:13:06.120 --> 2:13:11.080
 is like war and, but also like the complexity around war.

2:13:11.080 --> 2:13:12.280
 And it's funny.

2:13:12.280 --> 2:13:15.040
 We never spent that much time on World War II

2:13:15.040 --> 2:13:17.420
 because it was actually quite of a clean war.

2:13:17.420 --> 2:13:21.620
 It's a very atypical war as in the war object,

2:13:21.620 --> 2:13:23.240
 which we learned from World War I

2:13:23.240 --> 2:13:26.600
 is we must inflict suffering on the German people

2:13:26.600 --> 2:13:30.520
 and invade the borders of Germany and destroy Hitler.

2:13:30.520 --> 2:13:34.280
 Like the center of gravity is the Nazi regime and Hitler.

2:13:34.280 --> 2:13:37.360
 So it had a very basic begin and end.

2:13:37.360 --> 2:13:40.620
 Begin, liberate France, invade Germany,

2:13:40.620 --> 2:13:44.020
 destroy Hitler, reoccupy, rebuild.

2:13:44.020 --> 2:13:46.940
 World War I, what are you fighting for?

2:13:46.940 --> 2:13:49.520
 Like, are you, I mean, and nobody even knew.

2:13:49.520 --> 2:13:51.240
 You can go to the German general staff.

2:13:51.240 --> 2:13:53.920
 They were like, even in 1917, they're like,

2:13:53.920 --> 2:13:56.160
 the war was worth it because now we have Luxembourg.

2:13:56.160 --> 2:13:57.000
 I'm like, really?

2:13:57.000 --> 2:13:58.360
 Like you killed 2 million of your citizens

2:13:58.360 --> 2:14:01.040
 for fucking Luxembourg and like half of Belgium,

2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:02.640
 which is now like a pond.

2:14:02.640 --> 2:14:04.960
 And same thing, the French are like,

2:14:04.960 --> 2:14:07.480
 well, the French more so they're defending their borders,

2:14:07.480 --> 2:14:09.480
 but like, what are the British fighting for?

2:14:09.480 --> 2:14:11.520
 Why did hundreds of thousands of British people die?

2:14:11.520 --> 2:14:14.320
 In order to preserve the balance of power in Europe

2:14:14.320 --> 2:14:17.440
 and prevent the Kaiser from having a port

2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:19.300
 on the English Channel?

2:14:19.300 --> 2:14:21.440
 Like really, that's why?

2:14:21.440 --> 2:14:24.400
 That's more what wars are is they become these like

2:14:24.400 --> 2:14:29.400
 atypical, they become these protracted conflicts

2:14:29.400 --> 2:14:33.240
 with a necessary diplomatic resolution.

2:14:33.240 --> 2:14:36.240
 It's not clean, it's very dirty.

2:14:36.240 --> 2:14:38.880
 It usually leads in the outbreak of another war

2:14:38.880 --> 2:14:39.960
 and another war and another war

2:14:39.960 --> 2:14:43.040
 and a slow burn of ethnic conflict, which bubbles up.

2:14:43.040 --> 2:14:45.800
 So that's why I look at that one even,

2:14:45.800 --> 2:14:49.040
 because it's more typical of warfare and how it works.

2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:51.200
 Exactly, it's kind of interesting.

2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:54.320
 You're making me realize that World War II

2:14:54.320 --> 2:14:57.800
 is one of the rare wars where you can make a strong case

2:14:57.800 --> 2:14:59.600
 for it's a fight of good versus evil.

2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:01.120
 Yeah, just war theory, obviously.

2:15:01.120 --> 2:15:02.840
 Like, yeah, they're literally slaughtering Jews.

2:15:02.840 --> 2:15:04.280
 Like, we have to kill them.

2:15:04.280 --> 2:15:05.800
 And there's one person doing it.

2:15:05.800 --> 2:15:08.120
 I mean, there's one person at the core.

2:15:08.120 --> 2:15:11.280
 Yeah, that's fascinating.

2:15:11.280 --> 2:15:14.220
 And it's short and there's a clear aggression.

2:15:15.620 --> 2:15:18.720
 It's interesting that Dan Carlin

2:15:18.720 --> 2:15:20.980
 has been avoiding Hitler as well.

2:15:20.980 --> 2:15:23.960
 Yeah, probably for this reason.

2:15:23.960 --> 2:15:25.320
 Probably for this reason.

2:15:25.320 --> 2:15:27.360
 I mean, but it's complicated too,

2:15:27.360 --> 2:15:28.920
 because there's a pressure.

2:15:28.920 --> 2:15:30.600
 That guy has his demons.

2:15:30.600 --> 2:15:31.680
 I love Dan so much.

2:15:31.680 --> 2:15:35.720
 So this is the, I don't know if you feel this pressure,

2:15:36.720 --> 2:15:39.120
 but as a creative, he feels the pressure

2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:42.980
 of being maybe not necessarily correct,

2:15:43.900 --> 2:15:48.520
 but maybe correct in the sense that his understanding,

2:15:48.520 --> 2:15:53.520
 he gets to the bottom of why something happened,

2:15:53.520 --> 2:15:57.860
 of why something happened, of what really happened.

2:15:57.860 --> 2:15:59.540
 Get to the bottom of it

2:15:59.540 --> 2:16:02.540
 before he can say something publicly about it.

2:16:02.540 --> 2:16:04.900
 And he is tortured by that burden.

2:16:04.900 --> 2:16:06.980
 I know, you know, he takes so much shit

2:16:06.980 --> 2:16:09.220
 from the historical community for no reason.

2:16:09.220 --> 2:16:12.180
 I think he's the greatest popularizer, quote unquote,

2:16:12.180 --> 2:16:13.340
 of history.

2:16:13.340 --> 2:16:17.100
 And I wish more people in history understood it that way.

2:16:17.100 --> 2:16:18.420
 He was an inspiration to me.

2:16:18.420 --> 2:16:21.220
 I mean, I do some videos sometimes on my Instagram now

2:16:21.220 --> 2:16:22.980
 where I'll do like a book tour.

2:16:22.980 --> 2:16:24.680
 I'll be like, here's my bookshelf of these presidents.

2:16:24.680 --> 2:16:26.140
 And like, here's what I learned from this book

2:16:26.140 --> 2:16:26.980
 and this book and this.

2:16:26.980 --> 2:16:30.700
 And that was very much like a skill I learned from him

2:16:30.700 --> 2:16:33.940
 of being like, you know, as a historian writes.

2:16:33.940 --> 2:16:35.900
 You know, I just love the way he talks.

2:16:35.900 --> 2:16:38.180
 He's like, in the mud.

2:16:38.180 --> 2:16:40.900
 I mean, you know, he'll be like, quote, quote.

2:16:40.900 --> 2:16:44.660
 I just, I love, he inspires me, man.

2:16:44.660 --> 2:16:46.660
 He really does to like learn more.

2:16:46.660 --> 2:16:49.600
 And I've read, I bought a lot of books because of Dan Carlin.

2:16:49.600 --> 2:16:50.940
 He'll be, you know, because of this guy,

2:16:50.940 --> 2:16:53.260
 because of that guy, in terms of, you know,

2:16:53.260 --> 2:16:54.940
 another thing he does, which nobody else,

2:16:54.940 --> 2:16:56.220
 and I'm probably guilty of this,

2:16:56.220 --> 2:16:59.420
 he focuses on the actual people involved.

2:16:59.420 --> 2:17:03.300
 Like he would tell the story of actual British soldiers

2:17:03.300 --> 2:17:04.560
 in World War I.

2:17:04.560 --> 2:17:07.100
 And I probably, and maybe you're guilty of this too,

2:17:07.100 --> 2:17:09.740
 we over focus on what was happening

2:17:09.740 --> 2:17:11.020
 in the German general staff,

2:17:11.020 --> 2:17:12.760
 what was happening in the British general staff.

2:17:12.760 --> 2:17:14.220
 And he doesn't make that mistake.

2:17:14.220 --> 2:17:16.100
 That's why he tells real history.

2:17:16.100 --> 2:17:18.740
 Yeah, and it gives it a feeling.

2:17:18.740 --> 2:17:20.540
 The result is that there's a feeling,

2:17:20.540 --> 2:17:22.940
 you get the feeling of what it was like to be there.

2:17:22.940 --> 2:17:24.300
 Exactly.

2:17:24.300 --> 2:17:25.960
 You know, you're becoming,

2:17:25.960 --> 2:17:28.140
 quickly becoming more and more popular.

2:17:30.240 --> 2:17:32.940
 Speaking about political issues in part,

2:17:34.100 --> 2:17:38.540
 do you feel a burden, like almost like

2:17:39.540 --> 2:17:43.660
 the prison of your prior convictions

2:17:43.660 --> 2:17:47.660
 of having to, being popular with a certain kind of audience

2:17:47.660 --> 2:17:51.380
 and thereby unable to really think outside the box?

2:17:51.380 --> 2:17:54.440
 I had, I've really struggled with this.

2:17:54.440 --> 2:17:56.380
 I came up in right wing media.

2:17:56.380 --> 2:18:01.060
 I came up a much more doctrinaire conservative

2:18:01.060 --> 2:18:02.100
 in my professional life.

2:18:02.100 --> 2:18:02.980
 I wasn't always conservative.

2:18:02.980 --> 2:18:05.220
 We can get to that later if you want.

2:18:05.220 --> 2:18:10.220
 And I did feel an immense pressure after the election

2:18:13.240 --> 2:18:17.580
 by people to say, wanted me to say the election was stolen.

2:18:17.580 --> 2:18:21.620
 And I knew that I had a sizable part of my audience.

2:18:21.620 --> 2:18:22.780
 Oh, well, here's the benefit.

2:18:22.780 --> 2:18:24.220
 Most people know me from Rising,

2:18:24.220 --> 2:18:26.180
 which is with Crystal and me.

2:18:26.180 --> 2:18:29.400
 That is inherently a left right program.

2:18:29.400 --> 2:18:31.220
 So it's a large audience.

2:18:31.220 --> 2:18:35.500
 So I felt comfortable and I knew that I could still be fine

2:18:35.500 --> 2:18:37.280
 in terms of my numbers, whatever,

2:18:37.280 --> 2:18:40.260
 because a lot, many people knew me who were on the left.

2:18:40.260 --> 2:18:41.500
 And if really, you know,

2:18:41.500 --> 2:18:44.620
 my right listeners abandoned me, so be it.

2:18:44.620 --> 2:18:47.060
 I was, had the luxury of able to take that choice,

2:18:47.060 --> 2:18:50.980
 but I still felt an immense amount of pressure

2:18:50.980 --> 2:18:52.740
 to say the election was stolen,

2:18:52.740 --> 2:18:55.480
 to give credence to a lot of the stuff that Trump was doing,

2:18:55.480 --> 2:18:57.700
 to downplay January 6th,

2:18:57.700 --> 2:19:00.060
 to downplay many of the Republican senators

2:19:00.060 --> 2:19:01.860
 or justify many of the Republican senators,

2:19:01.860 --> 2:19:04.100
 some of whom I know who objected

2:19:04.100 --> 2:19:06.300
 to the electoral college certification

2:19:06.300 --> 2:19:08.900
 and who stoked some of the flames

2:19:08.900 --> 2:19:11.660
 that have eaten the Republican base.

2:19:11.660 --> 2:19:13.540
 And I just wouldn't do it.

2:19:13.540 --> 2:19:15.340
 And that was hard, man.

2:19:15.340 --> 2:19:19.820
 Like I feel more politically homeless right now

2:19:19.820 --> 2:19:21.620
 than I ever have,

2:19:21.620 --> 2:19:24.620
 but I have realized in the last couple of months

2:19:24.620 --> 2:19:26.280
 that's the best thing that ever happened to me.

2:19:26.280 --> 2:19:27.120
 It's freedom.

2:19:27.120 --> 2:19:28.580
 It's true freedom.

2:19:28.580 --> 2:19:32.660
 I now, I say exactly what I think.

2:19:32.660 --> 2:19:34.920
 And it's not that I wasn't doing that before.

2:19:34.920 --> 2:19:38.120
 It's maybe I would avoid certain topics

2:19:38.120 --> 2:19:40.660
 or like I would think about things

2:19:40.660 --> 2:19:42.780
 more from a team perspective of like,

2:19:42.780 --> 2:19:45.720
 am I making sure that, it's,

2:19:45.720 --> 2:19:46.740
 I'm not saying I didn't fight it.

2:19:46.740 --> 2:19:48.740
 And I still, I criticize the right plenty

2:19:48.740 --> 2:19:51.420
 and Trump plenty before the election and more.

2:19:51.420 --> 2:19:52.860
 It's more just like,

2:19:52.860 --> 2:19:56.580
 I no longer feel as if I even have the illusion

2:19:56.580 --> 2:19:58.580
 of a stake within the game.

2:19:58.580 --> 2:20:02.380
 I'm like, I only look at myself as an outside observer

2:20:02.380 --> 2:20:05.640
 and I will only call it as I see it truly.

2:20:05.640 --> 2:20:08.380
 And I was aspiring to that before,

2:20:08.380 --> 2:20:11.860
 but I had to have, in a way,

2:20:11.860 --> 2:20:13.460
 Trump stop the steal thing.

2:20:13.460 --> 2:20:16.140
 It like took my shackles off 100%.

2:20:16.140 --> 2:20:17.640
 Cause I was like, no, this is bullshit.

2:20:17.640 --> 2:20:18.940
 And I'm going to say it's bullshit.

2:20:18.940 --> 2:20:20.200
 And I think it's bad.

2:20:20.200 --> 2:20:22.380
 And I think it's bad for the Republican party.

2:20:22.380 --> 2:20:24.140
 And if people in the Republican party

2:20:24.140 --> 2:20:26.800
 don't agree with me on that, that's fine.

2:20:26.800 --> 2:20:29.220
 I'm just not going to be necessarily like

2:20:29.220 --> 2:20:30.900
 associated with you anymore.

2:20:30.900 --> 2:20:32.740
 This is probably one of the first political

2:20:32.740 --> 2:20:35.920
 liberal politics related conversations we've had.

2:20:35.920 --> 2:20:38.740
 I mean, unless you count Michael Malice, who.

2:20:38.740 --> 2:20:39.580
 He was great.

2:20:39.580 --> 2:20:40.420
 Yeah.

2:20:41.500 --> 2:20:42.500
 He's the funny guy.

2:20:42.500 --> 2:20:46.320
 He's not so much political as he is like burning down, man.

2:20:47.540 --> 2:20:49.980
 He leans too far in anarchy for me.

2:20:49.980 --> 2:20:50.820
 Yeah.

2:20:50.820 --> 2:20:51.640
 I think he's.

2:20:51.640 --> 2:20:53.240
 There's a place for that.

2:20:53.240 --> 2:20:54.940
 It's almost, well, first of all,

2:20:54.940 --> 2:20:57.980
 he's working on a new book, which I really appreciate.

2:20:57.980 --> 2:21:00.460
 Outside of the, he's working on like a big book

2:21:00.460 --> 2:21:02.340
 for a while, which is White Pill.

2:21:02.340 --> 2:21:07.100
 He's also working on this like short little thing,

2:21:07.100 --> 2:21:11.660
 which is like anarchist handbook or something like that.

2:21:11.660 --> 2:21:14.820
 It's like Anarchy for Idiots or something like that,

2:21:14.820 --> 2:21:16.140
 which I think is really.

2:21:19.040 --> 2:21:21.800
 Well, me being an idiot and being curious

2:21:21.800 --> 2:21:23.460
 about anarchy seems useful.

2:21:23.460 --> 2:21:24.660
 So I like those kinds of books.

2:21:24.660 --> 2:21:26.420
 That's Russian heritage, man.

2:21:26.420 --> 2:21:27.580
 Anarchist 101.

2:21:29.700 --> 2:21:33.620
 I find those kinds of things a useful thought experiment

2:21:33.620 --> 2:21:37.860
 because that's why it's frustrating to me

2:21:37.860 --> 2:21:40.460
 when people talk about communism, socialism,

2:21:40.460 --> 2:21:42.100
 or even capitalism,

2:21:42.100 --> 2:21:44.780
 where they can't enjoy the thought experiment

2:21:44.780 --> 2:21:49.780
 of like why did communism fail

2:21:50.860 --> 2:21:53.300
 and maybe ask the question of like,

2:21:53.300 --> 2:21:55.500
 is it possible to make communism succeed

2:21:55.500 --> 2:21:57.380
 or are there good ideas in communism?

2:21:57.380 --> 2:21:58.980
 Like I enjoy the thought experiment,

2:21:58.980 --> 2:22:01.220
 like the discourse of it,

2:22:01.220 --> 2:22:04.560
 like the reasoning and like devil's advocate and all that.

2:22:04.560 --> 2:22:07.120
 People have like, seem to not have patience for that.

2:22:07.120 --> 2:22:09.300
 They're like, communism bad, red.

2:22:09.300 --> 2:22:11.600
 I was obsessed with the question and still am.

2:22:11.600 --> 2:22:13.620
 I will never be,

2:22:13.620 --> 2:22:18.520
 I will never quench my thirst for Russian history.

2:22:18.520 --> 2:22:23.520
 I love that period of 1890 to 1925.

2:22:26.820 --> 2:22:30.180
 It's just like, it's so fucking crazy.

2:22:30.180 --> 2:22:35.020
 Like the autocracy embodied in Czar Alexander.

2:22:35.020 --> 2:22:38.820
 And then you get this like weird fail son, Nicholas,

2:22:38.820 --> 2:22:42.200
 who is kind of a good guy, but also terrible.

2:22:42.200 --> 2:22:44.820
 And also Russian autocracy itself is terrible.

2:22:44.820 --> 2:22:47.580
 And then I just became obsessed with the question of like,

2:22:47.580 --> 2:22:49.560
 why did the Bolshevik revolution succeed?

2:22:49.560 --> 2:22:51.300
 Because like people in Russia

2:22:51.300 --> 2:22:53.900
 didn't necessarily want Bolshevism.

2:22:53.900 --> 2:22:56.380
 People suffered a lot under Bolshevism

2:22:56.380 --> 2:22:58.080
 and it led to Stalinism.

2:22:58.080 --> 2:23:01.140
 How did Vladimir Lenin do it, right?

2:23:01.140 --> 2:23:04.520
 Like, and I became obsessed with that question.

2:23:04.520 --> 2:23:06.340
 And it's still, I find it so interesting,

2:23:06.340 --> 2:23:10.620
 which is that series of accidents of history,

2:23:10.620 --> 2:23:13.800
 incredible boldness by Lenin,

2:23:13.800 --> 2:23:17.800
 incredible real politic, smart,

2:23:17.800 --> 2:23:21.740
 unpopular decisions made by Trotsky and Stalin,

2:23:21.740 --> 2:23:25.420
 and just like the arrogance of the Czars

2:23:25.420 --> 2:23:30.420
 and of the Russian like autocracy.

2:23:31.500 --> 2:23:32.340
 But at the same time,

2:23:32.340 --> 2:23:35.180
 there's all these like cultural implications of this, right?

2:23:35.180 --> 2:23:37.660
 In terms of like how it became hollowed out

2:23:37.660 --> 2:23:40.100
 post Catherine the Great and all that.

2:23:40.100 --> 2:23:41.340
 I was obsessed with autocracy

2:23:41.340 --> 2:23:44.080
 because Russia wasn't actual autocracy.

2:23:44.080 --> 2:23:46.220
 And like actually, and I'm like, it was there.

2:23:46.220 --> 2:23:49.260
 Like they didn't even remove serfdom

2:23:49.260 --> 2:23:51.740
 to like the civil war in America.

2:23:51.740 --> 2:23:52.940
 Like that's crazy.

2:23:52.940 --> 2:23:55.860
 Like, you know, and nobody really talks about it.

2:23:55.860 --> 2:23:57.940
 And I just became, yeah, I was like,

2:23:57.940 --> 2:24:01.100
 was Bolshevism a natural reaction

2:24:01.100 --> 2:24:03.900
 to the excesses of Czarism?

2:24:03.900 --> 2:24:07.300
 There is a convenient explanation where that is true.

2:24:07.300 --> 2:24:09.960
 But there were also a series of decisions

2:24:09.960 --> 2:24:11.660
 made by Lenin and Stalin

2:24:11.660 --> 2:24:13.940
 to kill many of the people in the center left

2:24:13.940 --> 2:24:15.380
 and marginalized them

2:24:15.380 --> 2:24:18.540
 and also not to associate with the more

2:24:18.540 --> 2:24:23.120
 quote unquote, like amenable communists

2:24:23.120 --> 2:24:26.640
 in order to make sure that their pure strain of Bolshevism

2:24:26.640 --> 2:24:28.060
 was the only thing.

2:24:28.060 --> 2:24:29.960
 And the reason I like that is because it comes back

2:24:29.960 --> 2:24:31.420
 to a point I made earlier.

2:24:31.420 --> 2:24:32.740
 It's all about intentionality,

2:24:32.740 --> 2:24:36.940
 which is that you actually can will something into existence

2:24:36.940 --> 2:24:38.460
 even if people don't want it.

2:24:38.460 --> 2:24:39.460
 That was the craziest thing.

2:24:39.460 --> 2:24:41.360
 Like nobody wanted this,

2:24:41.360 --> 2:24:45.160
 but it's still ruled for half a century, more actually.

2:24:45.160 --> 2:24:47.640
 I mean, almost 75 years.

2:24:47.640 --> 2:24:50.140
 To think that there could have been a history

2:24:50.140 --> 2:24:55.140
 of the Soviet Union that was dramatically different

2:24:56.100 --> 2:25:00.860
 than Leninism, Stalinism, that was completely different.

2:25:00.860 --> 2:25:03.020
 Like almost would be the American story.

2:25:03.020 --> 2:25:04.340
 Yeah, easily.

2:25:04.340 --> 2:25:06.320
 I mean, there's a world where,

2:25:06.320 --> 2:25:07.780
 and I don't have all the characters,

2:25:07.780 --> 2:25:10.540
 there's like Kerensky and then there was like

2:25:10.540 --> 2:25:12.900
 whoever Lenin's number two, Stalin's chief rival.

2:25:12.900 --> 2:25:15.900
 And even, I mean, look, even a Soviet Union led by Trotsky,

2:25:15.900 --> 2:25:17.340
 that's a whole other world, right?

2:25:17.340 --> 2:25:19.420
 Like literally a whole other world.

2:25:19.420 --> 2:25:21.620
 And yeah, it's just, I don't know.

2:25:21.620 --> 2:25:22.500
 I find it so interesting.

2:25:22.500 --> 2:25:24.540
 I will never not be fascinated by Russia.

2:25:24.540 --> 2:25:25.660
 I always will.

2:25:25.660 --> 2:25:26.900
 It's funny that I get to talk to you.

2:25:26.900 --> 2:25:28.620
 Cause it's like, I read this book.

2:25:28.620 --> 2:25:29.460
 I forget what it's called.

2:25:29.460 --> 2:25:31.260
 It won, I think it won a Pulitzer prize.

2:25:31.260 --> 2:25:34.580
 And it was like the story of,

2:25:34.580 --> 2:25:37.420
 I tried to understand Russia post Crimea.

2:25:37.420 --> 2:25:40.120
 Cause I came up amongst people

2:25:40.120 --> 2:25:41.700
 who are much more like neoconservative

2:25:41.700 --> 2:25:43.900
 and they're like, fuck Russia, Russia bad.

2:25:43.900 --> 2:25:46.260
 And I was like, okay, like what do these people think?

2:25:46.260 --> 2:25:48.300
 And we have this narrative

2:25:48.300 --> 2:25:49.860
 of like the fall of the Soviet Union.

2:25:49.860 --> 2:25:52.980
 And then I read this book from the perspective of Russians

2:25:52.980 --> 2:25:54.220
 who lived through the fall.

2:25:54.220 --> 2:25:56.100
 And they were like, this is, I was like, this is terrible.

2:25:56.100 --> 2:25:59.540
 Like actually the introduction of capitalism was awful.

2:25:59.540 --> 2:26:03.060
 And like the rise of all these crazy oligarchs.

2:26:03.060 --> 2:26:08.060
 That's why Putin was, came to power to like restore,

2:26:08.980 --> 2:26:11.820
 restore order to the oligarchy.

2:26:11.820 --> 2:26:13.240
 And he still talks to this day.

2:26:13.240 --> 2:26:15.540
 Do you guys, I mean, that's always the threat of like,

2:26:15.540 --> 2:26:17.940
 do you want to return to the nineties?

2:26:17.940 --> 2:26:20.380
 Do you want to return to Yeltsin?

2:26:20.380 --> 2:26:21.660
 But the thing is in the West,

2:26:21.660 --> 2:26:23.940
 we have this like our own propaganda of like,

2:26:23.940 --> 2:26:25.020
 no, Yeltsin was great.

2:26:25.020 --> 2:26:25.980
 That was the golden age.

2:26:25.980 --> 2:26:27.660
 What could have been with Russia?

2:26:27.660 --> 2:26:29.980
 And I was like, well, what do actual Russians think?

2:26:29.980 --> 2:26:34.300
 And so that, yeah, I'll always be fascinated by it.

2:26:34.300 --> 2:26:37.980
 And then just like to understand the idea

2:26:37.980 --> 2:26:41.320
 of feeling encircled by NATO and all of that,

2:26:41.320 --> 2:26:44.500
 you have to understand like Russian defense theory

2:26:44.500 --> 2:26:46.460
 all the way of going back to the czars

2:26:46.460 --> 2:26:48.980
 has always been defense in depth

2:26:48.980 --> 2:26:51.780
 in terms of having Estonia, Lithuania,

2:26:51.780 --> 2:26:54.560
 and more as like protection of the heartland.

2:26:54.560 --> 2:26:55.600
 I'm not justifying in this.

2:26:55.600 --> 2:26:57.940
 So NATO shills like, please don't come after me.

2:26:57.940 --> 2:27:01.180
 But look, Estonians like NATO.

2:27:01.180 --> 2:27:02.020
 They want to be in NATO.

2:27:02.020 --> 2:27:03.080
 So I don't want to minimize that.

2:27:03.080 --> 2:27:04.300
 I'm more just saying like,

2:27:04.300 --> 2:27:08.900
 I understand him and Russia much better having done that.

2:27:08.900 --> 2:27:11.580
 And we are very incapable in America.

2:27:11.580 --> 2:27:13.260
 I think this is probably because my parents are immigrants

2:27:13.260 --> 2:27:14.340
 and I've traveled a lot.

2:27:14.340 --> 2:27:17.300
 Of like putting yourself in the mind of people

2:27:17.300 --> 2:27:21.060
 who aren't Western and haven't lived a history,

2:27:21.060 --> 2:27:23.340
 especially our lives of America's fucking awesome.

2:27:23.340 --> 2:27:24.580
 We're the number one country in the world.

2:27:24.580 --> 2:27:27.940
 Like we're literally better than you, like in many ways.

2:27:27.940 --> 2:27:31.380
 And they can't empathize with people

2:27:31.380 --> 2:27:33.720
 who have suffered so much.

2:27:33.720 --> 2:27:36.020
 And I just, yeah, it's just so interesting to me.

2:27:36.020 --> 2:27:38.760
 What about if we could talk for just a brief moment

2:27:38.760 --> 2:27:43.760
 about the human of Putin and power, you are clearly

2:27:45.460 --> 2:27:46.940
 fascinated by power.

2:27:48.260 --> 2:27:51.580
 Do you think power changed Putin?

2:27:51.580 --> 2:27:54.220
 Do you think power changes leaders?

2:27:54.220 --> 2:27:57.460
 If you look at the great leaders in history,

2:27:57.460 --> 2:28:02.180
 whether it's LBJ, FDR, do you think power really

2:28:02.180 --> 2:28:03.020
 changes people?

2:28:03.020 --> 2:28:06.100
 Like, is there a truth to that kind of old proverb?

2:28:06.100 --> 2:28:08.380
 It reveals, I think that's what it is.

2:28:08.380 --> 2:28:09.380
 It reveals.

2:28:09.380 --> 2:28:13.200
 So Putin was a much more deft politician,

2:28:13.200 --> 2:28:15.200
 much more amenable to the West.

2:28:15.200 --> 2:28:18.140
 If you think back, you know, to 2001 and more,

2:28:18.140 --> 2:28:19.980
 right when he came, cause he was still,

2:28:19.980 --> 2:28:21.860
 cause at that time his biggest problem

2:28:21.860 --> 2:28:24.160
 was intra Russian politics, right?

2:28:24.160 --> 2:28:27.420
 Like it was all consolidating power within the oligarchy.

2:28:27.420 --> 2:28:31.060
 Once he did that by around like 2007,

2:28:31.060 --> 2:28:34.680
 there's that famous time when he spoke out against the West

2:28:34.680 --> 2:28:36.140
 at the Munich security conference.

2:28:36.140 --> 2:28:37.500
 I forget when it was.

2:28:37.500 --> 2:28:40.460
 And that's when everybody in the audience was like, whoa.

2:28:40.460 --> 2:28:42.820
 And he was talking about like NATO encirclement

2:28:42.820 --> 2:28:45.660
 and like, we will not be beaten back by the West.

2:28:45.660 --> 2:28:49.020
 Very shortly afterwards, like the Georgia invasion happens.

2:28:49.020 --> 2:28:51.180
 And that was like a big wake up call of like,

2:28:51.180 --> 2:28:53.300
 we will not be pushed around anymore.

2:28:53.300 --> 2:28:55.980
 I mean, he said before publicly, like the worst thing

2:28:55.980 --> 2:28:57.340
 that ever happened was the fall.

2:28:57.340 --> 2:28:58.180
 Or what did he say?

2:28:58.180 --> 2:29:00.620
 He was like, the fall of the Soviet Union was a tragedy,

2:29:00.620 --> 2:29:01.460
 right?

2:29:01.460 --> 2:29:02.740
 Of course, people in the West were like, what?

2:29:02.740 --> 2:29:04.140
 I'm like, I get it, right?

2:29:04.140 --> 2:29:05.460
 Like they were a superpower.

2:29:05.460 --> 2:29:08.500
 And now their population is declining.

2:29:08.500 --> 2:29:09.580
 Like it's like a Petro state.

2:29:09.580 --> 2:29:10.420
 It sucks.

2:29:10.420 --> 2:29:11.780
 Like, I understand.

2:29:12.740 --> 2:29:15.600
 I understand like how somebody could feel about that.

2:29:15.600 --> 2:29:17.500
 I think it revealed his character,

2:29:18.760 --> 2:29:23.420
 which is that I think he thinks of himself probably

2:29:23.420 --> 2:29:27.780
 as he always has since 2001 as like this benevolent,

2:29:27.780 --> 2:29:29.060
 almost as a benevolent dictator.

2:29:29.060 --> 2:29:31.300
 He's like, without me, the whole system would collapse.

2:29:31.300 --> 2:29:35.280
 I'm the only guy keeping all these people in check.

2:29:35.280 --> 2:29:38.380
 Most Russians probably do support Putin

2:29:38.380 --> 2:29:41.420
 because they feel like they support some form

2:29:41.420 --> 2:29:43.480
 of functional government.

2:29:43.480 --> 2:29:46.400
 And they view it as like a check against that,

2:29:46.400 --> 2:29:50.980
 which is a long, has a long history within Russia too.

2:29:50.980 --> 2:29:53.160
 So I don't know if it changed him.

2:29:53.160 --> 2:29:55.940
 I think it just revealed him because it's not like he,

2:29:55.940 --> 2:29:56.780
 I mean, he has a bill.

2:29:56.780 --> 2:29:59.180
 You know, Navalny has put that like billion dollar palace

2:29:59.180 --> 2:30:00.680
 and all that.

2:30:00.680 --> 2:30:01.540
 I don't know.

2:30:01.540 --> 2:30:03.780
 Sometimes I feel like Putin does that for show.

2:30:03.780 --> 2:30:05.780
 He doesn't seem like somebody who indulges

2:30:05.780 --> 2:30:06.740
 in all that stuff.

2:30:06.740 --> 2:30:07.980
 Or maybe we just don't see it.

2:30:07.980 --> 2:30:08.820
 Like, I don't know.

2:30:08.820 --> 2:30:11.220
 Well, I don't, it's very difficult for me to understand.

2:30:11.220 --> 2:30:13.740
 I've been hanging out, thanks to Clubhouse.

2:30:13.740 --> 2:30:18.660
 A lot of, I've gotten to learn a lot about the Navalny folks

2:30:18.660 --> 2:30:20.380
 and it's been very educational.

2:30:21.260 --> 2:30:25.420
 Made me ask a lot of important questions about what,

2:30:25.420 --> 2:30:27.160
 you know, question a lot of my assumptions

2:30:27.160 --> 2:30:29.220
 about what I do and don't know.

2:30:29.220 --> 2:30:34.220
 But I'll just say that I do believe, you know,

2:30:34.440 --> 2:30:36.120
 there's a lot of the Navalny folks say

2:30:36.120 --> 2:30:40.660
 that Putin is incompetent and is a bad executive,

2:30:40.660 --> 2:30:44.340
 like is bad at basically running government.

2:30:44.340 --> 2:30:46.340
 But to me.

2:30:46.340 --> 2:30:48.460
 Well, why do Russians not think that?

2:30:48.460 --> 2:30:49.300
 Right?

2:30:49.300 --> 2:30:50.140
 Well, they probably say propaganda.

2:30:50.140 --> 2:30:51.060
 They would say it's the press.

2:30:51.060 --> 2:30:52.620
 Yeah, they would say the control.

2:30:52.620 --> 2:30:56.740
 There is a strong either control or pressure on the press,

2:30:56.740 --> 2:30:59.180
 but I think there is a legitimate support and love

2:30:59.180 --> 2:31:02.220
 of Putin in Russia that is not grounded

2:31:02.220 --> 2:31:05.100
 in just misinformation and propaganda.

2:31:05.100 --> 2:31:07.380
 There's legitimacy there.

2:31:07.380 --> 2:31:09.880
 Mostly I tried to remain apolitical

2:31:09.880 --> 2:31:12.860
 and actually genuinely remain apolitical.

2:31:12.860 --> 2:31:15.760
 I am legitimately not interested

2:31:15.760 --> 2:31:18.900
 in the politics of Russia of today.

2:31:18.900 --> 2:31:20.740
 I feel I have some responsibility

2:31:20.740 --> 2:31:23.580
 and I'll take that responsibility on as I need to.

2:31:23.580 --> 2:31:26.580
 But my fascination as it is perhaps with you

2:31:26.580 --> 2:31:30.620
 in part is in the historical figure of Putin.

2:31:30.620 --> 2:31:32.400
 I know he's currently president,

2:31:32.400 --> 2:31:34.820
 but I'm almost looking like as if I was a kid

2:31:34.820 --> 2:31:37.020
 in 30 years from now reading about him,

2:31:37.020 --> 2:31:39.120
 studying the human being,

2:31:40.120 --> 2:31:43.520
 the games of power that are played

2:31:43.520 --> 2:31:47.100
 that got him to gain power, to maintain power,

2:31:47.100 --> 2:31:51.100
 what that says about his human nature,

2:31:51.100 --> 2:31:54.860
 the nature of the bureaucracy that's around him,

2:31:54.860 --> 2:31:58.340
 the nature of Russia, the people, all those kinds of things,

2:31:58.340 --> 2:32:00.660
 as opposed to the politics and the manipulation

2:32:00.660 --> 2:32:03.620
 and the corruption and the control of the media

2:32:03.620 --> 2:32:05.780
 that results in misinformation.

2:32:05.780 --> 2:32:07.600
 Those are the bickering of the day,

2:32:07.600 --> 2:32:08.620
 just like we were saying,

2:32:08.620 --> 2:32:10.180
 what will actually be remembered

2:32:10.180 --> 2:32:11.540
 about this moment in history?

2:32:11.540 --> 2:32:14.020
 Totally, he's a transformational figure in Russian history.

2:32:14.020 --> 2:32:16.780
 Really, like the bridge between the fall of the Soviet Union

2:32:16.780 --> 2:32:18.500
 and the chaos of Yeltsin,

2:32:18.500 --> 2:32:21.020
 that will be how he's remembered.

2:32:21.020 --> 2:32:22.660
 The only question is what comes next

2:32:22.660 --> 2:32:24.700
 and what he wants to come next.

2:32:24.700 --> 2:32:26.540
 I'm always, I'm like, he's getting up.

2:32:26.540 --> 2:32:27.980
 How old are you, 60 something?

2:32:27.980 --> 2:32:28.820
 Yeah, 60.

2:32:28.820 --> 2:32:31.780
 So he would be, I think he would be 80.

2:32:31.780 --> 2:32:34.860
 So with the change of the constitution,

2:32:34.860 --> 2:32:39.860
 he cannot be president until 2034, I think it is.

2:32:44.500 --> 2:32:46.700
 So he would be like 80 something

2:32:46.700 --> 2:32:48.540
 and he would be in power for over 30 years,

2:32:48.540 --> 2:32:50.000
 which is longer than Stalin.

2:32:51.700 --> 2:32:54.420
 But he still seems to be.

2:32:54.420 --> 2:32:56.060
 Seems fit.

2:32:56.060 --> 2:32:57.900
 I think he's gonna be around for a long time.

2:32:57.900 --> 2:32:59.660
 But this is a fascinating question that you ask,

2:32:59.660 --> 2:33:01.880
 which is like, what does he want?

2:33:01.880 --> 2:33:02.720
 I don't know.

2:33:02.720 --> 2:33:03.560
 Yeah, that's the question.

2:33:03.560 --> 2:33:06.020
 I don't, and this is where I think,

2:33:06.020 --> 2:33:07.780
 given all of his behavior and more,

2:33:07.780 --> 2:33:09.180
 I don't know if it's about money.

2:33:09.180 --> 2:33:11.160
 I don't know if it's about enriching himself.

2:33:11.160 --> 2:33:13.620
 Obviously he did, to the tune of billions and billions

2:33:13.620 --> 2:33:15.100
 and billions of dollars.

2:33:15.100 --> 2:33:17.420
 But I think he probably,

2:33:17.420 --> 2:33:20.300
 he's as close to like an actual Russian nationalist,

2:33:20.300 --> 2:33:23.980
 like at the top, who really does believe in Russia

2:33:23.980 --> 2:33:26.020
 as its rightful superpower.

2:33:26.020 --> 2:33:29.320
 Everything he does seems to stem from that opposition

2:33:29.320 --> 2:33:31.220
 to NATO, intro to Syria,

2:33:31.220 --> 2:33:35.740
 like wanting to play a large role in affairs,

2:33:35.740 --> 2:33:40.300
 deeply distrustful and yet coveting of the European powers.

2:33:40.300 --> 2:33:44.580
 Like, I could describe every czar in those same language.

2:33:44.580 --> 2:33:47.160
 Like every czar falls into the exact same category.

2:33:47.160 --> 2:33:49.300
 Yeah, and I mean, it makes me wonder,

2:33:49.300 --> 2:33:52.740
 looking at some of the biggest leaders in human history,

2:33:52.740 --> 2:33:55.400
 to ask the question of what was the motivation?

2:33:55.400 --> 2:33:58.100
 What was the motivation for even just the revolutionaries

2:33:58.100 --> 2:34:00.280
 like Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin?

2:34:00.280 --> 2:34:02.040
 What was the motivation?

2:34:02.040 --> 2:34:05.760
 Because it sure as hell seems like the motivation

2:34:05.760 --> 2:34:10.660
 was at least in part driven by the idea,

2:34:11.500 --> 2:34:15.580
 by ideas, not self interest of like power.

2:34:15.580 --> 2:34:18.020
 For Lenin, it was, I think he was a true believer

2:34:18.020 --> 2:34:19.820
 and an actual narcissist

2:34:19.820 --> 2:34:21.580
 who thought he was the only one who could do it.

2:34:21.580 --> 2:34:23.660
 Stalin, I do think just wanted power.

2:34:23.660 --> 2:34:25.180
 And realized, well, I don't know.

2:34:25.180 --> 2:34:27.820
 Look, he wrote very passionately when he was young.

2:34:27.820 --> 2:34:30.260
 And he was, he really believed in communism.

2:34:30.260 --> 2:34:31.300
 In the beginning he did.

2:34:31.300 --> 2:34:34.460
 I'm always fascinated as I'm like,

2:34:34.460 --> 2:34:36.940
 around 1920, what happened, right?

2:34:36.940 --> 2:34:40.300
 Post revolution, you crushed the whites.

2:34:40.300 --> 2:34:42.500
 Now it's all about consolidation.

2:34:42.500 --> 2:34:44.780
 That's where the games really began.

2:34:44.780 --> 2:34:47.580
 And I'm like, I don't think that was about communism.

2:34:47.580 --> 2:34:48.420
 Yeah.

2:34:48.420 --> 2:34:53.260
 Yeah, maybe it became a useful propaganda tool,

2:34:53.260 --> 2:34:55.700
 but it still seemed like he believed in it.

2:34:55.700 --> 2:34:58.260
 Whether it was, of course, this is the question.

2:34:58.260 --> 2:35:01.480
 I mean, this is the problem with conspiracy theories for me.

2:35:02.480 --> 2:35:04.880
 And this is legitimate criticism towards me

2:35:04.880 --> 2:35:06.060
 about conspiracy theories,

2:35:06.060 --> 2:35:09.820
 which is just because you're not like this

2:35:09.820 --> 2:35:11.300
 doesn't mean others aren't like this.

2:35:11.300 --> 2:35:14.340
 So like, I can't believe that somebody be

2:35:14.340 --> 2:35:16.860
 like deeply two faced.

2:35:16.860 --> 2:35:18.980
 Oh, I've met them, you're welcome to Washington.

2:35:18.980 --> 2:35:20.420
 Yeah.

2:35:20.420 --> 2:35:25.420
 But like, I think that I would be able to detect like, no.

2:35:27.340 --> 2:35:30.820
 Well, this, my question is, well, so there's differences.

2:35:30.820 --> 2:35:35.620
 There's two face, like there's different levels of two face.

2:35:35.620 --> 2:35:39.340
 Like what I mean is to be killing people

2:35:39.340 --> 2:35:43.300
 and it's like house of cards style, right?

2:35:43.300 --> 2:35:48.300
 And still present a front like you're not killing people.

2:35:49.040 --> 2:35:52.100
 I don't know if, I guess it's possible,

2:35:52.100 --> 2:35:55.100
 but I just don't see that at scale.

2:35:55.100 --> 2:35:56.620
 Like there's a lot of people like that.

2:35:56.620 --> 2:35:58.980
 And I don't, I have trouble imagining

2:36:01.100 --> 2:36:04.260
 some, that's such a compelling narrative

2:36:04.260 --> 2:36:06.180
 that people like to say.

2:36:06.180 --> 2:36:09.820
 Like people, that's the conspiratorial mindset.

2:36:09.820 --> 2:36:11.700
 I think that skepticism was really powerful

2:36:11.700 --> 2:36:14.020
 and important to have because it's true.

2:36:14.020 --> 2:36:15.940
 A lot of powerful people abuse their power,

2:36:15.940 --> 2:36:20.940
 but saying that about, I feel like people over assume that.

2:36:21.940 --> 2:36:25.620
 It's like, I see that with use of steroids often in sports.

2:36:25.620 --> 2:36:29.380
 People seem to make that claim about like everybody

2:36:29.380 --> 2:36:32.400
 who's successful and I want to be very, I don't know.

2:36:32.400 --> 2:36:34.020
 Something about me wants to be cautious

2:36:34.020 --> 2:36:37.940
 because I want to give people a chance.

2:36:37.940 --> 2:36:39.540
 Being purely cynical isn't helpful.

2:36:39.540 --> 2:36:40.380
 People say this about me.

2:36:40.380 --> 2:36:42.500
 He's only saying this to do this.

2:36:42.500 --> 2:36:44.700
 But at the same time, being naively optimistic

2:36:44.700 --> 2:36:47.860
 about everything is also a kind of pedophilic scheme.

2:36:47.860 --> 2:36:49.180
 People are going to fuck you over.

2:36:49.180 --> 2:36:52.000
 And more importantly, that doesn't bother me.

2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:53.720
 More importantly, you're not going to be able to reason

2:36:53.720 --> 2:36:56.300
 about how to create systems that are going to be robust

2:36:56.300 --> 2:37:01.300
 to corruption, to malevolent parties.

2:37:01.380 --> 2:37:05.680
 So in order to create, you have to have a healthy balance

2:37:05.680 --> 2:37:08.900
 of both, I suppose, especially if you want to actually

2:37:08.900 --> 2:37:13.180
 engineer things that work in this world that has evil in it.

2:37:13.180 --> 2:37:15.700
 I can't believe there's a book of Hitler on the desk.

2:37:17.340 --> 2:37:20.480
 We've mentioned a lot of books throughout this conversation.

2:37:20.480 --> 2:37:24.680
 I wonder, and this makes me really curious to explore

2:37:25.780 --> 2:37:28.860
 in a lot of depth the kind of books

2:37:28.860 --> 2:37:30.320
 that you're interested in.

2:37:30.320 --> 2:37:32.780
 I think you mentioned in your show

2:37:32.780 --> 2:37:35.780
 that you provide recommendations.

2:37:35.780 --> 2:37:37.220
 Yes, I do.

2:37:37.220 --> 2:37:39.440
 In the form of spoken word,

2:37:39.440 --> 2:37:42.220
 can you beyond what we've already recommended

2:37:42.220 --> 2:37:47.220
 mention books, whether it is historical, nonfiction,

2:37:47.860 --> 2:37:50.460
 or whether it's more like philosophical or even fiction

2:37:50.460 --> 2:37:52.540
 that had a big impact on your life?

2:37:52.540 --> 2:37:53.820
 Is there a few that you can mention?

2:37:53.820 --> 2:37:54.660
 Sure.

2:37:54.660 --> 2:37:55.740
 I already talked about the Johnson books,

2:37:55.740 --> 2:37:56.820
 so I'll leave that alone.

2:37:56.820 --> 2:37:59.540
 Robert A. Caro, he's still alive, thank God.

2:37:59.540 --> 2:38:01.540
 He's finishing the last book.

2:38:01.540 --> 2:38:03.000
 I hope he makes it.

2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:05.380
 So those Johnson books.

2:38:05.380 --> 2:38:07.780
 Second, can I ask you a question about those books?

2:38:07.780 --> 2:38:08.620
 Yes.

2:38:08.620 --> 2:38:11.000
 What the hell do you fit into so many pages?

2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:11.840
 Everything, man.

2:38:12.900 --> 2:38:13.740
 Let me tell you this.

2:38:13.740 --> 2:38:14.860
 So I'll just give you an anecdote.

2:38:14.860 --> 2:38:16.500
 This is why I love these books.

2:38:16.500 --> 2:38:19.500
 The beginning, the first book is about Lyndon Johnson.

2:38:19.500 --> 2:38:22.780
 His life, when he gets elected to Congress,

2:38:22.780 --> 2:38:26.260
 the book begins with a history of Texas

2:38:26.260 --> 2:38:27.700
 and its weather patterns,

2:38:27.700 --> 2:38:32.700
 and then of his great, great grandfather moving to Texas.

2:38:32.700 --> 2:38:35.980
 Then the story of that, about a hundred or so pages in,

2:38:35.980 --> 2:38:37.300
 you get to Lyndon Johnson.

2:38:38.260 --> 2:38:39.980
 That's how you do it.

2:38:39.980 --> 2:38:40.820
 Which is you get.

2:38:40.820 --> 2:38:42.900
 It's like a Tolstoy style retelling.

2:38:42.900 --> 2:38:44.500
 This is the thing, it's not a biography,

2:38:44.500 --> 2:38:45.860
 it's a story of the times.

2:38:45.860 --> 2:38:47.460
 That's a great biography.

2:38:47.460 --> 2:38:49.940
 So another one, this isn't part of my list,

2:38:49.940 --> 2:38:50.780
 so don't do it,

2:38:52.020 --> 2:38:54.820
 is Grant, Ron Chernow.

2:38:54.820 --> 2:38:57.460
 Ron Chernow's Grant, it's a thousand pages.

2:38:57.460 --> 2:38:59.060
 And the reason I tell everybody to read it

2:38:59.060 --> 2:39:01.540
 is it's not just the story of Grant,

2:39:01.540 --> 2:39:04.380
 it is the story of pre civil war America,

2:39:04.380 --> 2:39:08.900
 the Mexican American war, the civil war and reconstruction,

2:39:08.900 --> 2:39:10.860
 all told in the life of one person

2:39:10.860 --> 2:39:12.540
 who was involved in all three.

2:39:12.540 --> 2:39:13.380
 Most people don't know anything

2:39:13.380 --> 2:39:14.460
 about the Mexican American war.

2:39:14.460 --> 2:39:15.820
 It's fascinating.

2:39:15.820 --> 2:39:18.140
 Most people don't know anything about reconstruction.

2:39:18.140 --> 2:39:19.780
 Now more so because people are talking,

2:39:19.780 --> 2:39:21.140
 it's a hot topic now.

2:39:21.140 --> 2:39:22.820
 I've been reading about it for years.

2:39:22.820 --> 2:39:26.260
 That is another thing people need to learn a lot more about.

2:39:26.260 --> 2:39:28.740
 In terms of non history books,

2:39:28.740 --> 2:39:31.780
 the book that probably had the most impact on me,

2:39:31.780 --> 2:39:34.820
 which is also a historical nonfiction

2:39:34.820 --> 2:39:39.820
 is I am obsessed with Antarctic exploration.

2:39:40.580 --> 2:39:43.380
 And it all began with a book

2:39:43.380 --> 2:39:45.900
 called Shackleton's Incredible Journey,

2:39:45.900 --> 2:39:48.700
 which is the collection of diaries

2:39:48.700 --> 2:39:51.140
 of everybody who was on Shackleton's journey.

2:39:51.140 --> 2:39:52.860
 For those who don't know,

2:39:52.860 --> 2:39:56.700
 Shackleton was the last explorer

2:39:56.700 --> 2:39:59.740
 of the heroic age of Antarctic exploration.

2:39:59.740 --> 2:40:03.020
 He led a ship called the Endurance,

2:40:03.020 --> 2:40:08.020
 which froze in the ice off the coast of Antarctica in 1914.

2:40:10.220 --> 2:40:13.740
 And they didn't have radios over the last exploration,

2:40:13.740 --> 2:40:16.060
 the last one without the age of radio.

2:40:16.060 --> 2:40:18.540
 And he happens to freeze in the ice.

2:40:18.540 --> 2:40:23.140
 And then the ship collapses after a year frozen in the ice.

2:40:23.140 --> 2:40:28.140
 And this man leads his entire crew from that ship

2:40:28.580 --> 2:40:31.100
 onto the ice with a team of dogs,

2:40:31.100 --> 2:40:34.420
 survives out on the ice for another year

2:40:34.420 --> 2:40:36.300
 with three little lifeboats

2:40:36.300 --> 2:40:38.780
 and is able to get all of his men,

2:40:38.780 --> 2:40:41.940
 every single one of them alive to an island

2:40:41.940 --> 2:40:44.860
 hundreds of miles away called Elephant Island.

2:40:44.860 --> 2:40:46.300
 And when they got there,

2:40:46.300 --> 2:40:50.420
 he had to leave everybody behind except for six people.

2:40:50.420 --> 2:40:54.660
 And him and two other guys, I'm forgetting their names,

2:40:54.660 --> 2:40:59.660
 navigated by the stars 800 miles through the Drake Passage

2:41:00.020 --> 2:41:03.540
 with seas of hundreds of feet to Prince,

2:41:03.540 --> 2:41:05.660
 I think it's called Prince George's Island.

2:41:05.660 --> 2:41:08.540
 And then when they got to Prince George's Island,

2:41:08.540 --> 2:41:10.340
 they landed on the wrong side

2:41:10.340 --> 2:41:14.060
 and they had to hike from one side to the other

2:41:14.060 --> 2:41:15.660
 to go and meet the whalers.

2:41:15.660 --> 2:41:17.500
 And every single one of those things

2:41:17.500 --> 2:41:18.900
 was supposed to be impossible.

2:41:18.900 --> 2:41:21.780
 Nobody was ever supposed to hike that island.

2:41:21.780 --> 2:41:24.220
 It wasn't done again until like the 1980s

2:41:24.220 --> 2:41:25.820
 with professional equipment.

2:41:25.820 --> 2:41:28.180
 He did it after two years of starvation.

2:41:28.180 --> 2:41:30.700
 Nobody was ever supposed to make it

2:41:30.700 --> 2:41:33.420
 from Elephant Island to Prince George.

2:41:33.420 --> 2:41:36.400
 The guy, they had to hold him steady, his legs,

2:41:36.400 --> 2:41:38.260
 so that he could chart the stars.

2:41:38.260 --> 2:41:41.680
 And if they miss this island, they're into open sea.

2:41:41.680 --> 2:41:42.740
 They're dead.

2:41:42.740 --> 2:41:44.180
 And then before that,

2:41:44.180 --> 2:41:46.300
 how do you survive for a year on the ice?

2:41:46.300 --> 2:41:47.540
 On seals.

2:41:47.540 --> 2:41:51.660
 And before that, he kept his crew from depression

2:41:51.660 --> 2:41:53.660
 frozen one year in the ice.

2:41:53.660 --> 2:41:55.500
 It's just an amazing story.

2:41:55.500 --> 2:41:58.420
 And it made me obsessed with Antarctic exploration.

2:41:58.420 --> 2:42:00.020
 So I've read like 15 books on it.

2:42:00.020 --> 2:42:01.860
 What the hell is it about the human spirit?

2:42:01.860 --> 2:42:02.700
 It's amazing.

2:42:02.700 --> 2:42:03.740
 That's the thing about Antarctica

2:42:03.740 --> 2:42:05.300
 is it brings it out of you.

2:42:05.300 --> 2:42:06.980
 So for example, I read another one recently

2:42:06.980 --> 2:42:08.900
 called Mawson's Will.

2:42:08.900 --> 2:42:10.740
 Douglas Mawson, he was an Australian.

2:42:10.740 --> 2:42:15.100
 He was on one of the first Robert Frost expeditions.

2:42:15.100 --> 2:42:17.540
 He leads an expedition down to the South.

2:42:17.540 --> 2:42:21.700
 Him and a partner, they're leading explorations,

2:42:21.700 --> 2:42:23.300
 1908, something like that.

2:42:23.300 --> 2:42:27.460
 They're going around Antarctica with dog teams.

2:42:27.460 --> 2:42:32.340
 And what happens is they keep going over these snow bridges

2:42:32.340 --> 2:42:34.620
 where there's a crevice, but it's covered in snow.

2:42:34.620 --> 2:42:38.420
 And so one of the lead driver,

2:42:38.420 --> 2:42:40.940
 the dogs go over and they plummet.

2:42:40.940 --> 2:42:43.260
 And that sled takes with it.

2:42:43.260 --> 2:42:47.420
 So the guy survives, but that sled takes all their food,

2:42:47.420 --> 2:42:52.420
 half the dogs, their stove, the camping tent,

2:42:52.860 --> 2:42:56.180
 the tent specifically designed for the snow, everything.

2:42:56.180 --> 2:42:59.820
 And they're hundreds of miles away from base camp.

2:42:59.820 --> 2:43:02.700
 He and this guy have to make it back there

2:43:02.700 --> 2:43:05.740
 in time before the ship comes to come get them

2:43:05.740 --> 2:43:07.700
 on an agreed upon date.

2:43:07.700 --> 2:43:08.780
 And he makes it.

2:43:08.780 --> 2:43:11.140
 But the guy he was with, he dies.

2:43:11.140 --> 2:43:12.620
 And it's a crazy story.

2:43:12.620 --> 2:43:14.260
 First of all, they have to eat the dogs.

2:43:14.260 --> 2:43:16.340
 A really creepy part of Antarctic exploration

2:43:16.340 --> 2:43:19.140
 is everyone ends up eating dogs at different points.

2:43:20.180 --> 2:43:22.900
 And part of the theory, which is so crazy,

2:43:22.900 --> 2:43:25.940
 is that the guy he was with was dying

2:43:25.940 --> 2:43:28.940
 because they were eating dog liver.

2:43:28.940 --> 2:43:31.260
 And dog liver has a lot of vitamin E,

2:43:31.260 --> 2:43:32.940
 which if you eat too much of it,

2:43:32.940 --> 2:43:34.700
 can give you like a poisoning.

2:43:34.700 --> 2:43:38.140
 And so Mawson, by trying to help his friend,

2:43:38.140 --> 2:43:38.980
 was giving him more liver.

2:43:38.980 --> 2:43:40.900
 Of all the things that kills you.

2:43:40.900 --> 2:43:42.780
 I know, it's dog liver.

2:43:42.780 --> 2:43:44.260
 And so his friend ends up dying,

2:43:44.260 --> 2:43:46.300
 have a horrific heart attack, all of that.

2:43:46.300 --> 2:43:49.660
 Mawson crawls back hundreds of miles away,

2:43:49.660 --> 2:43:54.140
 makes it back to base camp hours after the ship leaves.

2:43:54.140 --> 2:43:57.900
 And two guys or a couple of guys stayed behind for him.

2:43:57.900 --> 2:44:01.020
 And he basically has to recuperate for like six months

2:44:01.020 --> 2:44:02.580
 before he can even walk again.

2:44:02.580 --> 2:44:04.140
 But it's like you were saying about the human spirit.

2:44:04.140 --> 2:44:07.460
 It's like Antarctica brings that out of people.

2:44:07.460 --> 2:44:10.460
 Or Amundsen, the guy who made it to the South Pole,

2:44:10.460 --> 2:44:12.740
 Robert Amundsen, oh my God.

2:44:12.740 --> 2:44:16.740
 Like this guy trained his whole life in the ice

2:44:16.740 --> 2:44:20.060
 from Norway to make it to the South Pole.

2:44:20.060 --> 2:44:22.620
 And he beat Robert Frost, the British guy

2:44:22.620 --> 2:44:24.660
 with all this money and all these,

2:44:24.660 --> 2:44:26.060
 I could go on this forever.

2:44:26.060 --> 2:44:27.300
 I'm obsessed with it.

2:44:27.300 --> 2:44:31.500
 Well, first of all, I'm gonna take this part of the podcast.

2:44:31.500 --> 2:44:32.940
 I'm gonna set it to music.

2:44:32.940 --> 2:44:33.780
 I'm gonna listen to it.

2:44:33.780 --> 2:44:35.560
 Cause I've been whining and bitching

2:44:35.560 --> 2:44:39.180
 about running 48 miles of Goggins this next weekend.

2:44:39.180 --> 2:44:41.380
 And this is gonna be so easy.

2:44:41.380 --> 2:44:43.620
 I'm just gonna listen to this over and over in my head.

2:44:43.620 --> 2:44:44.460
 You're gonna be.

2:44:44.460 --> 2:44:45.780
 Elon's obsessed with Shackleton.

2:44:45.780 --> 2:44:46.620
 He talks about him all the time.

2:44:46.620 --> 2:44:48.780
 He uses, I was gonna ask you about that.

2:44:48.780 --> 2:44:53.380
 He uses an example of that as an example

2:44:53.380 --> 2:44:57.100
 of what Mars colonization would be like.

2:44:57.100 --> 2:44:58.500
 He's right.

2:44:58.500 --> 2:45:02.200
 No, Antarctica is as close to you can simulate that.

2:45:03.780 --> 2:45:05.540
 Antarctica is as close to what you could simulate

2:45:05.540 --> 2:45:06.380
 what it would get.

2:45:06.380 --> 2:45:09.260
 That Nat Geo series on Mars, I'm not sure

2:45:09.260 --> 2:45:10.780
 if you watched it, it's incredible.

2:45:10.780 --> 2:45:11.980
 Elon's actually in it.

2:45:11.980 --> 2:45:15.820
 And it's like, they get there, everything goes wrong.

2:45:15.820 --> 2:45:19.000
 Somebody dies, like it's horrible.

2:45:19.000 --> 2:45:20.540
 They can't find any water.

2:45:20.540 --> 2:45:21.760
 It's not working.

2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:22.600
 So what is it?

2:45:22.600 --> 2:45:23.940
 Is it like simulating the experience

2:45:23.940 --> 2:45:25.220
 of what it'd be like to colonize?

2:45:25.220 --> 2:45:28.940
 So it's like a docu series where the fictionalized part

2:45:28.940 --> 2:45:32.100
 is the like astronauts on Mars,

2:45:32.100 --> 2:45:34.580
 but then they're interviewing people like Elon Musk

2:45:34.580 --> 2:45:37.340
 and others who were the ones who like paved the way

2:45:37.340 --> 2:45:38.780
 to get to Mars.

2:45:38.780 --> 2:45:40.380
 So it's a really interesting concept.

2:45:40.380 --> 2:45:41.900
 I think it's on Netflix.

2:45:41.900 --> 2:45:44.180
 And yeah, I agree with him 100%,

2:45:44.180 --> 2:45:46.300
 which is that the first guys to make,

2:45:46.300 --> 2:45:51.020
 like for example, Robert Frost, who went to Australia,

2:45:51.020 --> 2:45:54.220
 sorry, to Antarctica, the British explorer

2:45:54.220 --> 2:45:56.220
 who was beaten to the South Pole three weeks

2:45:56.220 --> 2:45:59.260
 by Robert Amundsen, he died on the way back.

2:45:59.260 --> 2:46:01.460
 And the reason why is because he wasn't well prepared.

2:46:01.460 --> 2:46:02.580
 He was arrogant.

2:46:02.580 --> 2:46:06.060
 He didn't have the proper amounts of supplies.

2:46:06.060 --> 2:46:08.420
 His team had terrible morale.

2:46:08.420 --> 2:46:09.900
 Antarctica is a brutal place.

2:46:09.900 --> 2:46:12.220
 If you fuck up one time, you die.

2:46:12.220 --> 2:46:14.740
 And it's like, and this is what you read a lot about,

2:46:14.740 --> 2:46:17.180
 which is the reason why such heroic characters

2:46:17.180 --> 2:46:20.780
 like Shackleton Shine is a lot of people died.

2:46:20.780 --> 2:46:23.620
 Like there were some people who got frozen in the eye.

2:46:23.620 --> 2:46:27.980
 I mean, man, this again also came to the North exploration.

2:46:27.980 --> 2:46:29.700
 So I read a lot about like the exploration

2:46:29.700 --> 2:46:32.660
 of the North Pole and same thing.

2:46:32.660 --> 2:46:36.900
 These unextraordinary men take people out into the ice

2:46:36.900 --> 2:46:40.660
 and get frozen out there for years and shit goes so bad.

2:46:40.660 --> 2:46:42.540
 They end up eating each other.

2:46:42.540 --> 2:46:43.700
 They all die.

2:46:43.700 --> 2:46:45.740
 There's a famous, one I'm forgetting his name,

2:46:45.740 --> 2:46:47.580
 the British Franklin expedition,

2:46:47.580 --> 2:46:50.860
 where they went searching for them for like 20 years.

2:46:50.860 --> 2:46:52.900
 And they eventually came across a group of Inuit

2:46:52.900 --> 2:46:55.380
 who were like, oh yeah, we saw some weird white men here

2:46:55.380 --> 2:46:56.860
 like 15 years ago.

2:46:56.860 --> 2:46:59.020
 And they find their bones and there's like saw marks,

2:46:59.020 --> 2:47:01.020
 which showed that they were eating each other.

2:47:01.020 --> 2:47:01.860
 I mean.

2:47:01.860 --> 2:47:03.660
 So history remembers the ones who didn't eat each other.

2:47:03.660 --> 2:47:06.820
 Yeah, well, yeah, we remember the ones who made it,

2:47:06.820 --> 2:47:08.100
 but there are.

2:47:09.420 --> 2:47:11.140
 And that would be the story of Mars as well.

2:47:11.140 --> 2:47:12.300
 That will be the story of Mars.

2:47:12.300 --> 2:47:14.500
 But, and nevertheless, that's the interesting thing

2:47:14.500 --> 2:47:16.180
 about Antarctica.

2:47:16.180 --> 2:47:19.660
 Nevertheless, something about human nature

2:47:19.660 --> 2:47:21.500
 drives us to explore it.

2:47:21.500 --> 2:47:22.340
 Yes.

2:47:22.340 --> 2:47:23.980
 And that seems to be like, you know,

2:47:23.980 --> 2:47:26.180
 a lot of people have this kind of,

2:47:26.180 --> 2:47:28.460
 to me, frustrating conversations like,

2:47:28.460 --> 2:47:31.500
 well, Earth is great, man.

2:47:31.500 --> 2:47:33.180
 Why do we need to colonize Mars?

2:47:33.180 --> 2:47:34.660
 You just don't get it.

2:47:34.660 --> 2:47:35.500
 I don't know.

2:47:35.500 --> 2:47:36.340
 I mean, I don't know.

2:47:36.340 --> 2:47:39.220
 It's the same people that say like, why are you running?

2:47:39.220 --> 2:47:41.620
 Like, why are you running a marathon?

2:47:41.620 --> 2:47:43.980
 What are you running from, man?

2:47:43.980 --> 2:47:44.820
 I don't know.

2:47:44.820 --> 2:47:48.460
 It's pushing the limits of the human mind

2:47:48.460 --> 2:47:51.300
 of what's possible.

2:47:51.300 --> 2:47:54.180
 It's George Mallory because it's there.

2:47:54.180 --> 2:47:55.460
 Yeah. It's simple.

2:47:55.460 --> 2:47:59.340
 And that's somehow actually the result of that,

2:47:59.340 --> 2:48:01.900
 if you want to be pragmatic about it,

2:48:01.900 --> 2:48:04.260
 there's something about pushing that limit

2:48:04.260 --> 2:48:06.420
 that has side effects that you don't expect

2:48:06.420 --> 2:48:08.780
 that will create a better world back home

2:48:08.780 --> 2:48:11.020
 for the people, not necessarily on Earth,

2:48:11.020 --> 2:48:13.300
 but like just in general,

2:48:13.300 --> 2:48:16.060
 it raises the quality of life for everybody,

2:48:16.060 --> 2:48:19.900
 even though the initial endeavor doesn't make any sense.

2:48:19.900 --> 2:48:24.820
 The very fact of pushing the limits of what's possible

2:48:24.820 --> 2:48:28.740
 then has side effects of benefiting everybody.

2:48:28.740 --> 2:48:32.100
 And it's difficult to predict ahead of time

2:48:32.100 --> 2:48:33.540
 what those benefits will be.

2:48:33.540 --> 2:48:35.140
 Say with colonizing Mars,

2:48:35.140 --> 2:48:37.820
 it's unclear what the benefits will be for Earth

2:48:37.820 --> 2:48:39.860
 or in general with struggling.

2:48:39.860 --> 2:48:41.220
 What did we get from the moon?

2:48:41.220 --> 2:48:43.460
 What did we get from Apollo, right?

2:48:43.460 --> 2:48:45.460
 Technically, and there were a lot of socialists

2:48:45.460 --> 2:48:46.620
 at the time making this argument.

2:48:46.620 --> 2:48:49.340
 They're like, all this money going, you know what?

2:48:49.340 --> 2:48:52.780
 We went to the fucking moon in 1969.

2:48:52.780 --> 2:48:53.900
 That was amazing.

2:48:53.900 --> 2:48:57.980
 The greatest feat in human history, period.

2:48:57.980 --> 2:48:59.300
 What did we learn from it?

2:48:59.300 --> 2:49:04.060
 We learned about interstellar or interplanetary travel.

2:49:04.060 --> 2:49:06.540
 We learned that we could do something

2:49:06.540 --> 2:49:10.900
 off of a device less powerful than the computer in my pocket.

2:49:10.900 --> 2:49:15.500
 Like the amount of potential locked within my pocket

2:49:15.500 --> 2:49:17.420
 and your pocket, I mean, this is,

2:49:17.420 --> 2:49:19.380
 if you were to define my policies in one way,

2:49:19.380 --> 2:49:21.020
 it's greatness, like national,

2:49:21.020 --> 2:49:23.580
 a quest for national greatness.

2:49:23.580 --> 2:49:26.460
 There is no greatness without fulfilling

2:49:26.460 --> 2:49:28.660
 the ultimate calling of the human spirit,

2:49:28.660 --> 2:49:31.140
 which is more, it's not enough.

2:49:31.140 --> 2:49:32.500
 And why should it be?

2:49:32.500 --> 2:49:34.500
 It wasn't enough.

2:49:34.500 --> 2:49:38.340
 Our ancestors could have been content to sit,

2:49:38.340 --> 2:49:39.860
 well, actually many of them were,

2:49:39.860 --> 2:49:41.660
 were content to sit and say,

2:49:41.660 --> 2:49:43.420
 these berries will be here for a long time.

2:49:43.420 --> 2:49:44.940
 And they got eaten and they died.

2:49:44.940 --> 2:49:48.580
 And it's the ones who got out and went to the next place

2:49:48.580 --> 2:49:51.740
 and the next place and went across the Siberian land bridge

2:49:51.740 --> 2:49:53.740
 and went across more.

2:49:53.740 --> 2:49:55.420
 And it just did extraordinary things.

2:49:55.420 --> 2:49:58.180
 The craziest ones, we are their offspring

2:49:58.180 --> 2:50:01.380
 and we fail them if we don't go into space.

2:50:01.380 --> 2:50:02.660
 That's how I would put it.

2:50:03.940 --> 2:50:05.140
 You should run for president.

2:50:05.140 --> 2:50:07.500
 I'm just pro space, man.

2:50:07.500 --> 2:50:08.540
 I love space.

2:50:08.540 --> 2:50:10.780
 No, you're pro doing difficult things

2:50:10.780 --> 2:50:14.780
 and pushing, exploring the world in all of its forms.

2:50:14.780 --> 2:50:18.740
 I hope that kind of spirit permeates politics too.

2:50:18.740 --> 2:50:20.380
 That same kind of a...

2:50:20.380 --> 2:50:21.540
 Can, can.

2:50:21.540 --> 2:50:24.740
 I, well, it can, and I hope so.

2:50:24.740 --> 2:50:25.940
 I don't know if you want to stay on it,

2:50:25.940 --> 2:50:28.140
 but I think that was book number one or two.

2:50:28.140 --> 2:50:28.980
 Oh, shit.

2:50:28.980 --> 2:50:29.820
 Yeah, okay.

2:50:29.820 --> 2:50:30.660
 All right, all right.

2:50:30.660 --> 2:50:31.500
 Is there something else?

2:50:31.500 --> 2:50:32.340
 Well, this one is second,

2:50:32.340 --> 2:50:34.260
 this actually is a corollary to that, which is sapiens.

2:50:34.260 --> 2:50:37.620
 And I know that's a very normal, normie answer.

2:50:37.620 --> 2:50:38.580
 One of the best selling book.

2:50:38.580 --> 2:50:40.020
 I think there's a reason for that.

2:50:40.020 --> 2:50:41.540
 Yuval Noah Harari.

2:50:41.540 --> 2:50:42.380
 Oh, cool.

2:50:42.380 --> 2:50:44.620
 Okay, look, yes, he didn't do any new research.

2:50:44.620 --> 2:50:45.460
 I get that.

2:50:45.460 --> 2:50:46.500
 All he did was aggregate.

2:50:46.500 --> 2:50:49.020
 I'm sure he's very controversial in the scientific community,

2:50:49.020 --> 2:50:49.860
 but guess what?

2:50:49.860 --> 2:50:50.700
 He wrote a great book.

2:50:50.700 --> 2:50:55.700
 It's a very easy to read general explanation

2:50:56.020 --> 2:50:58.140
 of the rise of human history.

2:50:58.140 --> 2:51:00.580
 And it helps challenge a lot of preconceptions.

2:51:00.580 --> 2:51:01.580
 Are we special?

2:51:01.580 --> 2:51:02.620
 Are we an accident?

2:51:02.620 --> 2:51:04.220
 Are we more like a parasite?

2:51:04.220 --> 2:51:05.180
 Are we not?

2:51:05.180 --> 2:51:07.980
 What, is there a destiny to all of us?

2:51:07.980 --> 2:51:08.820
 I don't know.

2:51:08.820 --> 2:51:10.980
 You know, if anything, it's like what I just described,

2:51:10.980 --> 2:51:12.020
 which is more.

2:51:12.020 --> 2:51:14.140
 Move, move out.

2:51:14.140 --> 2:51:15.540
 The evolution of money.

2:51:15.540 --> 2:51:17.780
 Like, I know he gets a lot of hate,

2:51:17.780 --> 2:51:21.220
 but I think that he writes it so clearly and well

2:51:21.220 --> 2:51:23.580
 that for your average person to be able to read that,

2:51:23.580 --> 2:51:26.180
 you will come away with a more clear understanding

2:51:26.180 --> 2:51:28.860
 of the human race than before.

2:51:28.860 --> 2:51:30.700
 And I think that that's why it's worth it.

2:51:30.700 --> 2:51:32.140
 I agree with you 100%.

2:51:32.140 --> 2:51:35.580
 I'm ashamed to, I usually don't bring up sapiens

2:51:35.580 --> 2:51:36.540
 because it's like.

2:51:36.540 --> 2:51:38.780
 Yeah, it's like, everybody's uncle has read it,

2:51:38.780 --> 2:51:40.180
 but that's a good thing.

2:51:40.180 --> 2:51:43.340
 It is one of the, I think it'll be remembered

2:51:43.340 --> 2:51:46.460
 as one of the great books of this particular era.

2:51:46.460 --> 2:51:48.500
 Yeah, because it's so clearly,

2:51:48.500 --> 2:51:50.780
 it's like the selfish gene with Dawkins.

2:51:50.780 --> 2:51:53.460
 I mean, it just aggregates so many ideas together

2:51:53.460 --> 2:51:54.820
 and puts language to it

2:51:54.820 --> 2:51:57.260
 that makes it very useful to talk about.

2:51:57.260 --> 2:51:59.340
 So it is one of the great books.

2:51:59.340 --> 2:52:00.860
 100%.

2:52:00.860 --> 2:52:04.300
 Another one is definitely Born to Run for the same reason

2:52:04.300 --> 2:52:06.660
 by Christopher McDougall, which is that.

2:52:06.660 --> 2:52:09.020
 I'm just gonna listen to this whole podcast next week.

2:52:09.020 --> 2:52:09.860
 You have to.

2:52:09.860 --> 2:52:11.820
 Well, you should because it,

2:52:11.820 --> 2:52:15.860
 you are inheriting our most basic skill, which is running.

2:52:15.860 --> 2:52:19.060
 And reimagining human history

2:52:19.060 --> 2:52:22.180
 or reimagining like what we were

2:52:22.180 --> 2:52:25.820
 as opposed to what we are is very useful

2:52:25.820 --> 2:52:27.700
 because it helps you understand

2:52:27.700 --> 2:52:31.020
 how to tap into primal aspects of your brain,

2:52:31.020 --> 2:52:32.660
 which just drive you.

2:52:32.660 --> 2:52:35.580
 And the reason I love McDougall's writing is because

2:52:35.580 --> 2:52:37.100
 I love anybody who writes like this.

2:52:37.100 --> 2:52:39.580
 Malcolm Gladwell, who else?

2:52:39.580 --> 2:52:42.540
 Michael Lewis, people who find characters

2:52:42.540 --> 2:52:43.660
 to tell a bigger story.

2:52:43.660 --> 2:52:45.900
 Michael Lewis finds characters to tell us the story

2:52:45.900 --> 2:52:47.180
 of the financial crisis.

2:52:48.220 --> 2:52:50.660
 Malcolm Gladwell writes, finds characters to tell us

2:52:50.660 --> 2:52:53.020
 the story of learning new skills and outliers

2:52:53.020 --> 2:52:55.420
 and whatever his latest book is,

2:52:55.420 --> 2:52:56.940
 I forget what it's called.

2:52:56.940 --> 2:53:00.140
 But McDougall tells the vignettes

2:53:00.140 --> 2:53:02.540
 and a tiny story of a single person

2:53:02.540 --> 2:53:04.700
 in the history of running

2:53:04.700 --> 2:53:07.740
 and like how it's baked into your DNA.

2:53:07.740 --> 2:53:10.540
 And I think there was just something very useful

2:53:10.540 --> 2:53:11.700
 to that for me for being like,

2:53:11.700 --> 2:53:13.220
 I don't need to go to the gym

2:53:13.220 --> 2:53:15.380
 or like, I'm not saying, you should still go to the gym.

2:53:15.380 --> 2:53:16.220
 I'll be clear.

2:53:16.220 --> 2:53:19.820
 I'm saying like, in order to fulfill like who you are,

2:53:19.820 --> 2:53:23.660
 you can actually tap into something that's the most basic.

2:53:23.660 --> 2:53:24.940
 I don't know if, I'm sure if you listened

2:53:24.940 --> 2:53:27.100
 to the David Cho episode with Joe Rogan.

2:53:28.300 --> 2:53:29.140
 You know what I mean?

2:53:29.140 --> 2:53:30.340
 Oh, where he's the animal.

2:53:30.340 --> 2:53:31.180
 Yeah, right.

2:53:31.180 --> 2:53:32.020
 With the baboon.

2:53:32.020 --> 2:53:32.860
 When he goes hunting.

2:53:32.860 --> 2:53:33.900
 And there's something to that, man.

2:53:33.900 --> 2:53:34.740
 There's something to that.

2:53:34.740 --> 2:53:37.820
 Where it's just like, they are living the way

2:53:37.820 --> 2:53:39.500
 that we were supposed to.

2:53:39.500 --> 2:53:40.540
 We're not supposed, well,

2:53:40.540 --> 2:53:42.180
 I don't wanna put a normative judgment on it.

2:53:42.180 --> 2:53:45.180
 They're living the way that we used to.

2:53:45.180 --> 2:53:46.020
 There's something very fun.

2:53:46.020 --> 2:53:48.740
 It feels more honest somehow to our true nature.

2:53:48.740 --> 2:53:50.380
 There's a guy I follow on Instagram.

2:53:50.380 --> 2:53:53.740
 I've come from, Paul Saladino, Carnivore MD.

2:53:53.740 --> 2:53:57.220
 He just went over there to the Hadza to live with them.

2:53:57.220 --> 2:53:59.380
 And I was watching his stuff just like,

2:53:59.380 --> 2:54:03.460
 I was like, man, there's something in you that wants to go.

2:54:03.460 --> 2:54:05.100
 I'm like, I wanna do that.

2:54:05.100 --> 2:54:07.500
 I wouldn't be very good at it, but like I want to.

2:54:07.500 --> 2:54:10.940
 I'm so glad that somebody who thinks deeply about politics

2:54:10.940 --> 2:54:12.900
 is so fascinated with exploration

2:54:12.900 --> 2:54:17.740
 and with the very basic nature,

2:54:17.740 --> 2:54:20.180
 like human nature, nature of our existence.

2:54:20.180 --> 2:54:21.500
 I love that.

2:54:21.500 --> 2:54:23.060
 There's something in you.

2:54:23.060 --> 2:54:25.100
 And still you're stuck in DC.

2:54:25.100 --> 2:54:26.660
 For now, for now.

2:54:26.660 --> 2:54:31.660
 Speaking of which, you're from Texas.

2:54:32.580 --> 2:54:35.900
 What do you make of the future of Texas politically,

2:54:35.900 --> 2:54:39.580
 culturally, economically?

2:54:39.580 --> 2:54:43.580
 I am in part moving, well, I'm moving to Austin.

2:54:43.580 --> 2:54:44.420
 Congrats.

2:54:44.420 --> 2:54:46.860
 But I'm also doing the Eric Weinstein advice,

2:54:46.860 --> 2:54:49.380
 which is like, dude, you're not married.

2:54:49.380 --> 2:54:51.060
 You don't have kids.

2:54:51.060 --> 2:54:52.940
 There's no such thing as moving.

2:54:52.940 --> 2:54:54.580
 What are you moving?

2:54:54.580 --> 2:54:59.580
 You're like your three suits and some shirts and underwear.

2:54:59.940 --> 2:55:02.700
 What exactly is the move entail?

2:55:02.700 --> 2:55:03.660
 So I have nothing.

2:55:03.660 --> 2:55:07.980
 So I'm basically, it's very just remain mobile,

2:55:07.980 --> 2:55:12.620
 but there's a promise, there's a hope to Austin.

2:55:12.620 --> 2:55:17.300
 Outside of just like friendships,

2:55:17.300 --> 2:55:18.980
 I have no, it's a very different culture

2:55:18.980 --> 2:55:20.220
 that Joe Rogan is creating.

2:55:20.220 --> 2:55:24.220
 I'm mostly interested in what the next Silicon Valley

2:55:24.220 --> 2:55:28.500
 will be, what the next hub of technological innovation.

2:55:28.500 --> 2:55:32.060
 And there's a promise, maybe a dream

2:55:32.060 --> 2:55:34.460
 for Austin being that next place.

2:55:34.460 --> 2:55:35.420
 It's very possible.

2:55:35.420 --> 2:55:40.420
 Doesn't have the baggage of some of the political things,

2:55:40.620 --> 2:55:45.620
 maybe some of the sort of things that hold back

2:55:46.100 --> 2:55:49.700
 the beauty of, that makes capitalism,

2:55:49.700 --> 2:55:51.740
 that makes innovation so powerful,

2:55:51.740 --> 2:55:55.540
 which is like meritocracy, which is excellence.

2:55:55.540 --> 2:55:57.380
 Diversity is exceptionally important,

2:55:57.380 --> 2:56:01.700
 but it should not be the only priority.

2:56:01.700 --> 2:56:05.820
 It has to be something that coexists

2:56:05.820 --> 2:56:10.260
 with a like insatiable drive towards excellence.

2:56:10.260 --> 2:56:13.580
 And it seems like Texas is a nice place,

2:56:13.580 --> 2:56:18.580
 like having a Austin, which is like a kind of this weird,

2:56:19.060 --> 2:56:20.500
 I hope it stays weird, man.

2:56:20.500 --> 2:56:21.660
 I love weird people.

2:56:21.660 --> 2:56:24.380
 I don't know about that, but we can get into it.

2:56:24.380 --> 2:56:29.380
 But there's this hope is it remains this weird place

2:56:29.380 --> 2:56:34.380
 of brilliant innovation amidst a state

2:56:35.060 --> 2:56:36.420
 that's like more conservative.

2:56:36.420 --> 2:56:38.380
 So like there's a nice balance of everything.

2:56:38.380 --> 2:56:40.380
 What are your thoughts about the future of Texas?

2:56:40.380 --> 2:56:43.180
 I think it's so fascinating to me

2:56:43.180 --> 2:56:46.880
 because I never thought I would want to move back,

2:56:46.880 --> 2:56:50.500
 but now I'm beginning to be convinced.

2:56:50.500 --> 2:56:53.700
 So I'm going to stick to this clip.

2:56:53.700 --> 2:56:55.220
 I am, I'm being honest

2:56:55.220 --> 2:56:56.700
 and many Texas will hate me for this.

2:56:56.700 --> 2:57:00.580
 But Texas was not a place that was kind to me, quote unquote.

2:57:00.580 --> 2:57:04.140
 And this is because of my own parent.

2:57:04.140 --> 2:57:07.020
 Look, I was raised in College Station, Texas,

2:57:07.020 --> 2:57:08.780
 which is a town of 50,000.

2:57:08.780 --> 2:57:10.420
 It's a university town.

2:57:10.420 --> 2:57:13.080
 It exists only for the university.

2:57:13.080 --> 2:57:14.500
 So it was a very,

2:57:14.500 --> 2:57:16.500
 I did not get the full Texas experience

2:57:16.500 --> 2:57:19.260
 purely speaking from a College Station experience.

2:57:19.260 --> 2:57:24.260
 But growing up first generation, or I forget what it is,

2:57:25.300 --> 2:57:26.220
 I'm the first American.

2:57:26.220 --> 2:57:27.900
 I was born and raised in College Station.

2:57:27.900 --> 2:57:29.140
 My parents are from India.

2:57:30.220 --> 2:57:34.860
 Being raised in a town where the dominant culture

2:57:34.860 --> 2:57:38.900
 was predominantly like white evangelical Christian was hard.

2:57:38.900 --> 2:57:40.540
 Like it was just difficult.

2:57:40.540 --> 2:57:43.820
 And I think of it,

2:57:43.820 --> 2:57:46.260
 in the beginning, I would say like ages,

2:57:46.260 --> 2:57:48.260
 like zero to like eight,

2:57:48.260 --> 2:57:50.540
 it was like cultural ignorance,

2:57:50.540 --> 2:57:53.500
 as in like they just don't know how to interact with you.

2:57:53.500 --> 2:57:55.660
 And there was a level of,

2:57:55.660 --> 2:57:58.580
 always there was like the evangelical kind of antipathy

2:57:58.580 --> 2:58:01.140
 towards like you being not Christian.

2:58:01.140 --> 2:58:02.220
 You know, my parents are Hindu.

2:58:02.220 --> 2:58:03.860
 Like that's how I was raised.

2:58:03.860 --> 2:58:05.920
 And so like, there was that.

2:58:05.920 --> 2:58:08.220
 But 9 11 was very difficult.

2:58:08.220 --> 2:58:13.040
 Like 9 11 happened when I was in third or fourth grade.

2:58:13.040 --> 2:58:15.020
 And that changed everything, man.

2:58:15.020 --> 2:58:18.440
 Like, I mean, our temple had to like print out T shirts.

2:58:18.440 --> 2:58:20.460
 And I'm not saying this is a sob story, to be clear.

2:58:20.460 --> 2:58:23.000
 I've still actually largely for my adult life

2:58:23.000 --> 2:58:24.220
 identified on the political right.

2:58:24.220 --> 2:58:27.140
 So don't take this as some like, you know, race manifesto.

2:58:27.140 --> 2:58:29.220
 I'm just telling it like, this is what happened,

2:58:29.220 --> 2:58:32.540
 which is that like we had,

2:58:32.540 --> 2:58:35.340
 it was just hard to be proud, frankly,

2:58:35.340 --> 2:58:40.340
 and to have some of the fallout from 9 11 and during Iraq.

2:58:40.580 --> 2:58:45.580
 And the reason I am political is because I realize in myself,

2:58:46.300 --> 2:58:49.660
 I have a strong rebellious nature

2:58:49.660 --> 2:58:52.980
 against systems and structures of power.

2:58:52.980 --> 2:58:55.700
 And the first people I ever rebelled against

2:58:55.700 --> 2:58:58.860
 were all the people telling me to shut up

2:58:58.860 --> 2:59:00.660
 and not question the Iraq war.

2:59:00.660 --> 2:59:02.660
 So the reason I am in politics

2:59:02.660 --> 2:59:07.340
 is because I hated George W. Bush with a passion

2:59:07.340 --> 2:59:08.860
 and I hated the war.

2:59:08.860 --> 2:59:10.960
 And I was so, again, my entire background

2:59:10.960 --> 2:59:12.740
 is largely in national security for this reason,

2:59:12.740 --> 2:59:15.660
 which is I was obsessed with the idea of like,

2:59:15.660 --> 2:59:18.340
 how do we get people who are not gonna get us

2:59:18.340 --> 2:59:21.380
 into these quagmire situations in positions of power?

2:59:21.380 --> 2:59:24.220
 That's how I became fascinated by power in the first place

2:59:24.220 --> 2:59:27.800
 was all a question of how do this happen?

2:59:27.800 --> 2:59:30.460
 Like, how did this catastrophe happen?

2:59:30.460 --> 2:59:32.300
 I realized it's not as bad as like, you know,

2:59:32.300 --> 2:59:34.500
 previous conflicts, but this one was mine.

2:59:34.500 --> 2:59:38.100
 And to see how it changed our domestic politics forever.

2:59:38.100 --> 2:59:40.760
 And so that was my rebellion.

2:59:40.760 --> 2:59:41.600
 But it's funny,

2:59:41.600 --> 2:59:44.580
 because I identified on the left when I was growing up,

2:59:44.580 --> 2:59:48.700
 up until I was 18, I had also a funny two year stint.

2:59:48.700 --> 2:59:50.260
 This is where everything kind of changed for me

2:59:50.260 --> 2:59:51.620
 when I was 16, actually.

2:59:51.620 --> 2:59:53.780
 I moved to Qatar, to Doha, Qatar,

2:59:53.780 --> 2:59:57.380
 because my dad was a dean or associate dean

2:59:57.380 --> 3:00:00.160
 of Texas A&M University at Doha.

3:00:00.160 --> 3:00:02.160
 So my last two years of high school were at this.

3:00:02.160 --> 3:00:04.160
 I went from this small town in Texas,

3:00:04.160 --> 3:00:07.440
 and I love my parents because they could recognize

3:00:07.440 --> 3:00:10.140
 that I had within me that I was not a small town kid.

3:00:10.140 --> 3:00:13.320
 So they took me out of this country every chance they got.

3:00:13.320 --> 3:00:16.420
 I traveled everywhere and constantly let me go.

3:00:16.420 --> 3:00:20.100
 And so I went from school in College Station

3:00:20.100 --> 3:00:24.380
 to like this ritzy private school, American school.

3:00:24.380 --> 3:00:26.140
 Best thing that ever happened to me,

3:00:26.140 --> 3:00:29.520
 because first of all, it got me out of College Station.

3:00:29.520 --> 3:00:34.260
 Second, at that time, I had this annoying streak of,

3:00:34.260 --> 3:00:36.400
 I wouldn't call it being anti America,

3:00:36.400 --> 3:00:38.640
 but you don't appreciate America.

3:00:38.640 --> 3:00:40.380
 Let me tell everybody out there listening,

3:00:40.380 --> 3:00:44.940
 leave for a while, you will miss it so much.

3:00:44.940 --> 3:00:47.740
 You do not know what it is like

3:00:47.740 --> 3:00:50.900
 to not have freedom of speech until you don't have it.

3:00:50.900 --> 3:00:55.140
 And I was going to high school

3:00:55.140 --> 3:00:57.940
 with these guys in the Qatari royal family.

3:00:57.940 --> 3:00:59.940
 And all I wanted to do was speak out

3:00:59.940 --> 3:01:01.380
 of how they were pieces of shit

3:01:01.380 --> 3:01:03.740
 for the way that they treated Indian citizens

3:01:03.740 --> 3:01:06.940
 in that country who are basically used as slave labor.

3:01:06.940 --> 3:01:08.780
 And I could not say one word

3:01:08.780 --> 3:01:10.500
 because I knew I would be deported

3:01:10.500 --> 3:01:12.460
 and I knew my dad would lose his job

3:01:12.460 --> 3:01:13.940
 and my mom would lose her job

3:01:13.940 --> 3:01:15.920
 and we would be forced out of the country.

3:01:15.920 --> 3:01:17.660
 You don't know what it's like to live like that.

3:01:17.660 --> 3:01:20.240
 Or to be in a society where like,

3:01:20.240 --> 3:01:22.420
 you have like a high school girlfriend or something

3:01:22.420 --> 3:01:25.080
 and you can't even touch in public

3:01:25.080 --> 3:01:27.600
 or you're lectured for public decency.

3:01:27.600 --> 3:01:31.120
 Like, listen, I've lived under a Gulf monarchy now.

3:01:31.120 --> 3:01:36.120
 And that turned me into the most pro America guy ever.

3:01:36.220 --> 3:01:40.140
 Like I came back so like Merica,

3:01:40.140 --> 3:01:43.740
 like I still am because of that experience.

3:01:43.740 --> 3:01:46.220
 Living abroad, like that will do it to you.

3:01:46.220 --> 3:01:48.380
 Live in a non democracy.

3:01:48.380 --> 3:01:51.580
 You have, even in Europe, I would say,

3:01:51.580 --> 3:01:53.260
 you guys aren't living as free as we are here.

3:01:53.260 --> 3:01:55.140
 It's awesome and I love it.

3:01:55.140 --> 3:01:56.680
 You're ultimately another human being

3:01:56.680 --> 3:01:58.420
 than the one who left Texas.

3:01:58.420 --> 3:01:59.260
 Yeah.

3:01:59.260 --> 3:02:03.060
 So, I mean, have you actually considered moving to Texas

3:02:03.060 --> 3:02:05.720
 and broadly just outside of your own story,

3:02:05.720 --> 3:02:07.460
 what do you think is the future of Texas?

3:02:07.460 --> 3:02:08.980
 What is the future of Austin?

3:02:08.980 --> 3:02:12.940
 There's so much transformation seemingly happening now

3:02:12.940 --> 3:02:15.460
 related to Silicon Valley, to California.

3:02:15.460 --> 3:02:16.300
 That's what's been so hard to me,

3:02:16.300 --> 3:02:18.980
 which is that since I left, it's changed dramatically,

3:02:18.980 --> 3:02:22.860
 which is that it used to be like this conservative state

3:02:22.860 --> 3:02:25.700
 where the main money to be made was oil.

3:02:25.700 --> 3:02:26.660
 And everybody knew that.

3:02:26.660 --> 3:02:30.420
 Petro, it was a Petro state, Houston, all of that.

3:02:30.420 --> 3:02:33.200
 Austin was always weird, but it was more of a music town

3:02:33.200 --> 3:02:34.240
 and a university town.

3:02:34.240 --> 3:02:35.740
 It was not a tech town.

3:02:35.740 --> 3:02:39.180
 But in the 10 years or so since I left,

3:02:39.180 --> 3:02:40.900
 I have begun to realize, I'm like,

3:02:40.900 --> 3:02:43.180
 well, the Texas I grew up in is over.

3:02:43.180 --> 3:02:48.180
 It is not a deep red state in any sense of the term.

3:02:48.220 --> 3:02:51.780
 The number one Uhaul route in the country pre pandemic

3:02:51.780 --> 3:02:54.480
 already was San Francisco to Austin, okay?

3:02:54.480 --> 3:02:57.520
 So like you have this massive influx of people

3:02:57.520 --> 3:03:00.100
 from California and New York.

3:03:00.100 --> 3:03:03.020
 And the state, the composition of it

3:03:03.020 --> 3:03:04.780
 is changed dramatically.

3:03:04.780 --> 3:03:08.020
 The intra composition and the ultra, yeah.

3:03:08.020 --> 3:03:10.500
 So the intra composition, it's become way more urban.

3:03:10.500 --> 3:03:13.540
 It's from when I grew up, Texas was a much more rural state.

3:03:13.540 --> 3:03:15.460
 Its politics were much more static.

3:03:15.460 --> 3:03:17.580
 It looked much more like Rick Perry,

3:03:17.580 --> 3:03:22.580
 like he was a very accurate representation of who we were.

3:03:22.620 --> 3:03:25.420
 Now, I don't think that that's the case.

3:03:25.420 --> 3:03:28.180
 Texas is now a dynamic economy,

3:03:28.180 --> 3:03:32.720
 not just 100% reliant on oil because of its kind of like,

3:03:33.580 --> 3:03:35.780
 I would call it like regulatory arbitrage

3:03:35.780 --> 3:03:38.060
 relative to California and New York

3:03:38.060 --> 3:03:41.540
 offers a large incentive to people who are more,

3:03:41.540 --> 3:03:43.060
 I wouldn't say culturally liberal,

3:03:43.060 --> 3:03:45.400
 but they're not necessarily like culturally conservative,

3:03:45.400 --> 3:03:47.140
 like the people who I grew up with.

3:03:47.140 --> 3:03:49.180
 That's changed the whole state's politics.

3:03:49.180 --> 3:03:51.940
 Beto came two points away from beating Ted Cruz.

3:03:51.940 --> 3:03:53.500
 I'm not saying the state's gonna go blue.

3:03:53.500 --> 3:03:55.540
 I think the Republican party will just change

3:03:55.540 --> 3:03:57.100
 and we'll have to readjust.

3:03:57.100 --> 3:04:01.940
 But the re urbanization of Texas has made it,

3:04:01.940 --> 3:04:03.220
 I'll put it in this way,

3:04:03.220 --> 3:04:08.220
 much more attractive to me than the place that I grew up.

3:04:09.380 --> 3:04:11.320
 And then from my perspective,

3:04:11.320 --> 3:04:12.160
 well, first of all,

3:04:12.160 --> 3:04:16.660
 I love some of the cowboy things that Texas stands for,

3:04:16.660 --> 3:04:18.740
 but for more practically, from my perspective,

3:04:18.740 --> 3:04:23.160
 the injection of the tech innovation

3:04:23.160 --> 3:04:27.860
 that's moving to Texas has made it very exciting to me.

3:04:27.860 --> 3:04:29.780
 It seems like outside of all that,

3:04:29.780 --> 3:04:32.060
 maybe you can speak to the weird in Austin.

3:04:32.060 --> 3:04:37.060
 It seems like I know that Joe Rogan is a rich,

3:04:39.380 --> 3:04:42.980
 sort of almost like mainstream at this point,

3:04:42.980 --> 3:04:45.260
 but he's also attracting a lot of weirdos.

3:04:45.260 --> 3:04:48.740
 And so is Elon and a lot of those weirdos are my friends

3:04:48.740 --> 3:04:52.560
 and they're like Michael Malice, like those weirdos.

3:04:53.540 --> 3:04:55.840
 And it's like, I have a hope for Austin

3:04:55.840 --> 3:04:57.900
 that all kinds of different flavors of weirdos

3:04:57.900 --> 3:04:59.020
 will get injected.

3:04:59.020 --> 3:05:00.140
 It's possible.

3:05:00.140 --> 3:05:02.860
 I actually think the most significant thing that happened

3:05:02.860 --> 3:05:06.180
 were Tesla moving there.

3:05:06.180 --> 3:05:08.360
 The reason why is I love Joe, obviously,

3:05:08.360 --> 3:05:11.260
 but he can only attract X amount of people.

3:05:11.260 --> 3:05:14.460
 Elon actually employs thousands of people.

3:05:14.460 --> 3:05:16.980
 And then you will also Oracle.

3:05:16.980 --> 3:05:20.840
 Oracle's decision to move to Austin is just as important

3:05:20.840 --> 3:05:25.440
 because those two men, Larry, was it Ellison, right?

3:05:25.440 --> 3:05:27.260
 Ellison and Elon,

3:05:27.260 --> 3:05:30.380
 they actually employ tens of thousands of people

3:05:30.380 --> 3:05:33.740
 collectively, that can change the nature of the city.

3:05:33.740 --> 3:05:36.620
 So you combine that with Joe bringing

3:05:36.620 --> 3:05:39.060
 this entire new entertainment complex

3:05:39.060 --> 3:05:42.740
 with the bodies of people who will appreciate

3:05:42.740 --> 3:05:44.540
 said entertainment complex.

3:05:44.540 --> 3:05:46.220
 Spend money on the entertainment.

3:05:46.220 --> 3:05:48.780
 Exactly, you just remade the entire city.

3:05:48.780 --> 3:05:50.820
 And that's why I'm fascinated.

3:05:50.820 --> 3:05:52.260
 And obviously there's network effects,

3:05:52.260 --> 3:05:54.660
 which is now that all those people are down there,

3:05:54.660 --> 3:05:55.940
 I mean, if I were Elon Musk,

3:05:55.940 --> 3:05:57.460
 I would donate a shit ton of money

3:05:57.460 --> 3:05:58.580
 to the University of Texas

3:05:58.580 --> 3:06:01.340
 and I would turn it into my Stanford for Silicon Valley.

3:06:01.340 --> 3:06:03.180
 Let's introduce some competition

3:06:03.180 --> 3:06:07.100
 and let UT Austin hire the best software developers,

3:06:07.100 --> 3:06:08.820
 engineers, professors, and more,

3:06:08.820 --> 3:06:12.900
 and turn Texas into a true like Austin revolving door hub

3:06:12.900 --> 3:06:16.500
 where people come to UT Austin to get an internship at Tesla

3:06:16.500 --> 3:06:18.420
 and then become an executive there

3:06:18.420 --> 3:06:19.980
 and then create their own company

3:06:19.980 --> 3:06:22.660
 in their own garage in Austin,

3:06:22.660 --> 3:06:24.560
 which is the next Facebook, Twitter.

3:06:24.560 --> 3:06:25.700
 That's how it happens.

3:06:25.700 --> 3:06:27.620
 This is why I'm much more skeptical of Miami.

3:06:27.620 --> 3:06:29.380
 There's a whole like tech Miami crew.

3:06:29.380 --> 3:06:32.220
 I'm like, yeah, like there's no university.

3:06:32.220 --> 3:06:34.060
 It's very inorganic.

3:06:34.060 --> 3:06:35.420
 Look, I think Miami is awesome.

3:06:35.420 --> 3:06:38.220
 I just like, I don't know if the same building blocks

3:06:38.220 --> 3:06:42.060
 are there and also no multi billion dollar companies

3:06:42.060 --> 3:06:44.840
 which employ thousands of people are coming there.

3:06:44.840 --> 3:06:45.880
 That's the ingredient.

3:06:45.880 --> 3:06:47.340
 It's not just Joe Rogan.

3:06:47.340 --> 3:06:48.940
 It's not just even Elon Musk

3:06:48.940 --> 3:06:50.660
 if he's still operated in California.

3:06:50.660 --> 3:06:52.700
 It's all the people he employs.

3:06:52.700 --> 3:06:56.460
 I think that is where, I think Texas is going

3:06:56.460 --> 3:06:59.380
 to dramatically change within the next 10 years.

3:06:59.380 --> 3:07:03.260
 Alternative to, it's already become a more urbanized state

3:07:03.260 --> 3:07:05.760
 that's moved away from oil and gas

3:07:05.760 --> 3:07:07.440
 in terms of like its emphasis,

3:07:07.440 --> 3:07:09.860
 not necessarily in terms of his real economics.

3:07:09.860 --> 3:07:11.120
 And 10 years from now,

3:07:11.120 --> 3:07:14.300
 I don't think it will be necessarily the name prop

3:07:14.300 --> 3:07:16.380
 like of the town.

3:07:16.380 --> 3:07:19.340
 The only question to me is how that manifests politically

3:07:19.340 --> 3:07:22.060
 because it's very possible though,

3:07:22.060 --> 3:07:24.160
 because a lot of these workers themselves

3:07:24.160 --> 3:07:27.300
 are California culturally liberal.

3:07:27.300 --> 3:07:29.640
 You could see a Gavin Newsom type person

3:07:29.640 --> 3:07:31.900
 getting elected governor of Texas

3:07:31.900 --> 3:07:34.360
 or like the mayor of Austin.

3:07:34.360 --> 3:07:36.340
 I mean, look, mayor of Austin is already a Democrat, right?

3:07:36.340 --> 3:07:39.460
 Like, I mean, Joe has his own problems with Austin.

3:07:39.460 --> 3:07:41.540
 It's funny, I remember him leaving LA

3:07:41.540 --> 3:07:43.700
 and I'm like, I don't know, have you been to Austin?

3:07:43.700 --> 3:07:48.460
 Like, it's not everything it's cracked up to be,

3:07:48.460 --> 3:07:49.300
 necessarily.

3:07:49.300 --> 3:07:52.980
 But no matter what, a new place allows the possibility

3:07:52.980 --> 3:07:57.180
 for new ideas, even if they're somehow left leaning

3:07:57.180 --> 3:07:58.180
 and all those kinds of things.

3:07:58.180 --> 3:08:00.320
 I do think the only two things missing

3:08:00.320 --> 3:08:04.620
 from Austin and Texas are two dudes in a suit

3:08:05.580 --> 3:08:07.140
 that sometimes have a podcast

3:08:07.140 --> 3:08:08.720
 talking a bunch of nonsense on a mic.

3:08:08.720 --> 3:08:11.700
 So let's bring the best suit game to Texas.

3:08:11.700 --> 3:08:15.120
 I hope you do make it to Texas at some point.

3:08:15.120 --> 3:08:17.220
 Thanks so much for talking to me.

3:08:17.220 --> 3:08:18.780
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

3:08:18.780 --> 3:08:20.020
 with Sagar and Jetty.

3:08:20.020 --> 3:08:22.020

 And now let me leave you with some words

3:08:36.900 --> 3:08:38.860
 from Martin Luther King Jr.

3:08:38.860 --> 3:08:42.860
 About the idea that what is just and what is legal

3:08:42.860 --> 3:08:44.980
 are not always the same thing.

3:08:44.980 --> 3:08:49.340
 He said, never forget that what Hitler did in Germany

3:08:49.340 --> 3:08:50.220
 was legal.

3:08:50.220 --> 3:09:17.220
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
