00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
 The following is a conversation with Yoram Brook and Yoram Hazoni.

00:04.640 --> 00:09.840
 This is Yoram's third time on this podcast and Yoram's first time.

00:09.840 --> 00:15.560
 Yoram Brook is an Objectivist Philosopher, Chairman of the Ayn Rand Institute, host of

00:15.560 --> 00:21.920
 the Yoram Brook Show, and the coauthor of Free Market Revolution and Equal is Unfair.

00:21.920 --> 00:28.960
 Yoram Hazoni is a National Conservatism thinker, Chairman of the Edmund Burke Foundation that

00:28.960 --> 00:32.400
 hosted the National Conservatism Conference.

00:32.400 --> 00:39.320
 He is also the host of the NatCon Talk and author of The Virtue of Nationalism and an

00:39.320 --> 00:44.040
 upcoming book called Conservatism, A Rediscovery.

00:44.040 --> 00:51.120
 Allow me to say a few words about each part of the two word title of this episode, Nationalism

00:51.120 --> 00:52.760
 Debate.

00:52.760 --> 00:58.720
 First Debate, I would like to have a few conversations this year that are a kind of debate with two

00:58.720 --> 01:03.640
 or three people that hold differing views on a particular topic but come to the table

01:03.640 --> 01:09.720
 with respect for each other and a desire to learn and discover something interesting together

01:09.720 --> 01:14.400
 through the empathetic exploration of the tension between their ideas.

01:14.400 --> 01:18.040
 This is not strictly a debate, it is simply a conversation.

01:18.040 --> 01:23.200
 There is no structure, there is no winners, except of course just a bit of trash talking

01:23.200 --> 01:24.860
 to keep it fun.

01:24.860 --> 01:29.200
 Some of these topics will be very difficult and I hope you can keep an open mind and have

01:29.200 --> 01:34.920
 patience with me as the kind of moderator who tries to bring out the best in each person

01:34.920 --> 01:36.960
 and the ideas discussed.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.640
 Okay that's my comment on the word Debate.

01:39.640 --> 01:42.060
 Now onto the word Nationalism.

01:42.060 --> 01:48.120
 This debate could have been called Nationalism versus Individualism or National Conservatism

01:48.120 --> 01:54.080
 versus Individualism or just Conservatism versus Individualism.

01:54.080 --> 01:58.200
 As we discussed in this episode, these words have slightly different meanings depending

01:58.200 --> 01:59.660
 on who you ask.

01:59.660 --> 02:04.140
 This is especially true, I think, for any word that ends in "-ism".

02:04.140 --> 02:08.240
 I personally enjoy the discussion of the meaning of such philosophical words.

02:08.240 --> 02:13.360
 I don't think it's possible to arrive at a perfect definition that everybody agrees with,

02:13.360 --> 02:19.520
 but the process of trying to do so for a bit is interesting and productive, at least to

02:19.520 --> 02:20.560
 me.

02:20.560 --> 02:26.260
 As long as we don't get stuck there, as some folks sometimes do in these conversations.

02:26.260 --> 02:31.320
 This is the Lex Readman Podcast, to support it please check out our sponsors in the description

02:31.320 --> 02:37.320
 and now here's my conversation with Yoram Brooke and Yoram Hosoni.

02:37.320 --> 02:41.520
 I attended the excellent debate between the two of you yesterday at UT Austin.

02:41.520 --> 02:47.020
 The debate was between ideas of Conservatism, represented by Yoram Hosoni, and ideas of

02:47.020 --> 02:51.080
 Individualism, represented by Yoram Brooke.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.080
 Let's start with the topics of the debate.

02:53.080 --> 02:58.320
 Yoram, how do you define Conservatism, maybe in the way you were thinking about it yesterday?

02:58.320 --> 03:02.360
 What to you are some principles of Conservatism?

03:02.360 --> 03:07.380
 Let me define it and then we can get into principles if you want.

03:07.380 --> 03:14.040
 When I talk about political Conservatism, I'm talking about a political standpoint that

03:14.040 --> 03:22.000
 regards the recovery, elaboration, and restoration of tradition as the key to maintaining a nation

03:22.000 --> 03:24.780
 and strengthening it through time.

03:24.780 --> 03:29.520
 This is something that if you have time to talk about it like we do on the show, it's

03:29.520 --> 03:35.800
 worth emphasizing that Conservatism is not like Liberalism or Marxism.

03:35.800 --> 03:42.200
 Liberalism and Marxism are both kind of universal theories and they claim to be able to tell

03:42.200 --> 03:47.160
 you what's good for human beings at all times in all places.

03:47.160 --> 03:52.520
 And Conservatism is a little bit different because it's going to carry different values

03:52.520 --> 03:54.960
 in every nation, in every tribe.

03:54.960 --> 04:01.400
 Even every family, you can say, has somewhat different values and these loyalty groups,

04:01.400 --> 04:03.560
 they compete with one another.

04:03.560 --> 04:04.720
 That's the way human beings work.

04:04.720 --> 04:08.680
 So it's deeply rooted in history of that particular area of land.

04:08.680 --> 04:14.320
 Well, I wouldn't necessarily say land, you're right that many forms of Conservatism are

04:14.320 --> 04:16.340
 tied to a particular place.

04:16.340 --> 04:22.200
 So how does the implementation of Conservatism to you differ from the ideal of Conservatism,

04:22.200 --> 04:26.200
 the implementations you've seen of political Conservatism in the United States and the

04:26.200 --> 04:27.200
 rest of the world?

04:27.200 --> 04:32.600
 Just to give some context, because it's a loaded term, like most political terms.

04:32.600 --> 04:36.320
 So when people think about conservative in the United States, they think about the Republican

04:36.320 --> 04:41.920
 Party, what, can you kind of disambiguate some of this, what are we supposed to think

04:41.920 --> 04:42.920
 about?

04:42.920 --> 04:44.720
 Yeah, that's a really important question.

04:44.720 --> 04:52.800
 Usually the word conservative is associated with Edmund Burke and with the English common

04:52.800 --> 04:54.800
 law tradition.

04:54.800 --> 05:00.560
 Going back centuries and centuries, there's kind of a classical English conservative tradition

05:00.560 --> 05:11.160
 that goes Fortescue, Hooker, Coke, Seldon, Hale, Burke, Blackstone before Burke.

05:11.160 --> 05:17.060
 If you take that kind of as a benchmark and you compare it, then you can compare it to

05:17.060 --> 05:23.000
 things like the American Federalist Party at the time of the American founding is in

05:23.000 --> 05:29.240
 many respects very much in keeping with that tradition.

05:29.240 --> 05:36.360
 As you go forward, there's an increasing mix of liberalism into conservatism.

05:36.360 --> 05:44.480
 I think by the time you get to the 1960s with William Buckley and Frank Meyer, the jargon

05:44.480 --> 05:45.640
 term is fusionism.

05:45.640 --> 05:52.120
 By the time you get there, it's arguable that their conservatism isn't very conservative

05:52.120 --> 05:58.580
 anymore, that it's kind of a public liberalism mixed with a private conservatism.

05:58.580 --> 06:04.240
 So a lot of the debate that we have today about what does the word conservatism actually

06:04.240 --> 06:09.840
 mean, a lot of the confusion comes from that, comes from the fact that on the one hand,

06:09.840 --> 06:17.640
 we have people who use the term, I think properly historically to refer to this common law tradition

06:17.640 --> 06:22.480
 of which Burke was a spokesman, but there are lots of other people who when they say

06:22.480 --> 06:27.280
 conservative, they just mean liberal.

06:27.280 --> 06:30.600
 I think that's a big problem.

06:30.600 --> 06:36.520
 It's a problem just to have an intelligent debate is difficult when people are using

06:36.520 --> 06:39.560
 the word almost too antithetical.

06:39.560 --> 06:42.400
 What would you say the essential idea of conservatism is time?

06:42.400 --> 06:44.280
 You mentioned your father's a physicist.

06:44.280 --> 06:50.480
 So a lot of physicists when they form models of the universe, they don't consider time.

06:50.480 --> 06:53.280
 So everything is dealt with instantaneously.

06:53.280 --> 06:58.880
 A particle is represented fully by its current state, velocity and position.

06:58.880 --> 07:06.920
 You're saying, so you're arguing with all of physics and your father, as we always do,

07:06.920 --> 07:10.200
 that their time matters in conservatism.

07:10.200 --> 07:14.480
 That's the fundamental element is the full history matters and you cannot separate the

07:14.480 --> 07:19.000
 individual from the history, from the roots that they come from.

07:19.000 --> 07:25.320
 The parallel in political theory is what's called rationalism.

07:25.320 --> 07:28.280
 I guess we'll probably talk about that some.

07:28.280 --> 07:31.460
 Rationalism is kind of an instantaneous, timeless thing.

07:31.460 --> 07:36.480
 Before I mentioned that liberalism and various enlightenment theories, they don't include

07:36.480 --> 07:37.580
 time at all.

07:37.580 --> 07:42.840
 Their goal is to say, look, there's such a thing as universal human reason.

07:42.840 --> 07:47.840
 All human beings, if they reason properly, will come to the same conclusions.

07:47.840 --> 07:51.600
 If that's true, then it removes the time consideration.

07:51.600 --> 07:57.680
 It removes tradition and context because everywhere where you are at any time, you ought to be

07:57.680 --> 08:03.580
 able to use reason and come to the same conclusions about politics or morals.

08:03.580 --> 08:12.160
 So that's a theory like Immanuel Kant or John Locke is an example, Hobbes is an example.

08:12.160 --> 08:19.340
 That kind of political theorizing really does say at a given instant, we can know pretty

08:19.340 --> 08:23.560
 much everything that we need to know, at least the big things.

08:23.560 --> 08:26.920
 And conservatism is the opposite.

08:26.920 --> 08:33.400
 It's a traditionalist view, exactly as you say, that says that history is crucial.

08:33.400 --> 08:41.120
 So you're on, you say that history is interesting, but perhaps not crucial if in the context

08:41.120 --> 08:42.120
 of individualism.

08:42.120 --> 08:47.120
 No, I mean, I think there's a false dichotomy he presented here, and that is that one view

08:47.120 --> 08:53.180
 holds that you can derive anything from a particular historical path and kind of an

08:53.180 --> 08:54.800
 empirical view.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.360
 And if we know the history, we know where we should be tomorrow.

08:57.360 --> 09:00.100
 We know where we should stand today.

09:00.100 --> 09:04.640
 And the other path is we ignore history, we ignore facts, we ignore what's going on.

09:04.640 --> 09:10.640
 We can derive from some a priori axioms, we can derive a truth right now.

09:10.640 --> 09:11.640
 And both are false.

09:11.640 --> 09:14.060
 Both of those views, in my view, are false.

09:14.060 --> 09:19.520
 And you know, Ayn Rand and I reject both of those views.

09:19.520 --> 09:23.440
 And I think the better thinkers of the Enlightenment did as well, although they sometimes fall

09:23.440 --> 09:25.920
 into the trap of appearing like rationalists.

09:25.920 --> 09:33.680
 And Jorm and I agree on one thing, and that is that Kant is one of, you know, we've talked

09:33.680 --> 09:36.840
 about this in the past, Alex, but we both hate Kant.

09:36.840 --> 09:44.520
 We both think Kant is, I at least think Kant is probably the most destructive philosopher

09:44.520 --> 09:49.120
 since Plato, who was pretty destructive himself.

09:49.120 --> 09:52.960
 And part of the problem is that Kant divorces reason from reality.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.040
 That is, he divorces reason from history.

09:55.040 --> 09:59.480
 He divorces reason from experience, because we don't have direct experience of reality

09:59.480 --> 10:01.040
 according to Kant, right?

10:01.040 --> 10:03.280
 We're removed from that direct experience.

10:03.280 --> 10:09.880
 But I view Kant as the anti Enlightenment, that is, I view Kant as the destroyer of good

10:09.880 --> 10:11.480
 Enlightenment thinking.

10:11.480 --> 10:18.240
 And I acknowledge a lot of history of philosophy, people who do history of philosophy view Kant

10:18.240 --> 10:21.800
 as the embodiment of the Enlightenment, that is the ultimate.

10:21.800 --> 10:22.960
 But I think that's a mistake.

10:22.960 --> 10:28.840
 I think both Rousseau and Kant are fundamentally the goal, the mission in life is to destroy

10:28.840 --> 10:30.380
 the Enlightenment.

10:30.380 --> 10:33.840
 So my view is neither of those options are the right option.

10:33.840 --> 10:39.040
 That is, the true reason based, reason is not divorced from reality.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.080
 It's quite the opposite.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.080
 Reason is a tool.

10:41.080 --> 10:45.740
 It's a faculty of identifying and integrating what?

10:45.740 --> 10:52.360
 It's identifying and integrating the facts of reality as we know them through sense perception

10:52.360 --> 10:55.860
 or through the study of history, through what actually happened.

10:55.860 --> 10:58.140
 So it's the integration of those facts.

10:58.140 --> 11:00.360
 It's the knowledge of that history.

11:00.360 --> 11:06.080
 And then what we do is we abstract away principles based on what's worked in the past, what hasn't

11:06.080 --> 11:10.920
 worked in the past, the consequences of different ideas, different past, different actions.

11:10.920 --> 11:14.720
 We abstract away principles that then can be universal.

11:14.720 --> 11:15.720
 Not always.

11:15.720 --> 11:16.720
 We make mistakes, right?

11:16.720 --> 11:19.640
 We can come up with a universal principle, it turns out it's not.

11:19.640 --> 11:25.160
 But if we have the whole scope of human history, we can derive principles as we do in life,

11:25.160 --> 11:30.600
 as individuals, we derive principles that are then truths that we can live by, but you

11:30.600 --> 11:32.160
 don't do that by ignoring history.

11:32.160 --> 11:36.960
 You do that by learning history, by understanding history, by understanding in a sense tradition

11:36.960 --> 11:40.000
 and where it leads to, and then trying to do better.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.200
 And I think good thinkers are constantly trying to do better based on what they know about

11:44.200 --> 11:46.240
 the past and what they know about the present.

11:46.240 --> 11:53.720
 What's the difference between studying history on a journey of reason and tradition?

11:53.720 --> 11:57.680
 So you mentioned that Burke understood that reason begins with an inherited tradition

11:57.680 --> 11:58.680
 yesterday.

11:58.680 --> 12:03.620
 So what's the difference between studying history, but then being free to go any way

12:03.620 --> 12:12.600
 you want and tradition where it feels more, I don't want to say a negative term like burden,

12:12.600 --> 12:18.960
 but there's more of a momentum that forces you to go the same way as your ancestors.

12:18.960 --> 12:23.640
 It's the recognition that people are wrong, often are wrong.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.000
 Including parents?

12:25.000 --> 12:28.640
 Including your parents, including your teachers, including everybody.

12:28.640 --> 12:34.080
 Everybody is potentially wrong, and that you can't accept anybody just because they happen

12:34.080 --> 12:35.880
 to come before you.

12:35.880 --> 12:39.400
 That is, you have to evaluate and judge, and you have to have a standard by which to evaluate

12:39.400 --> 12:44.120
 and judge the actions of those who came before you, whether they are your parents, whether

12:44.120 --> 12:49.120
 they are the state in which you happen to be born, whether they are somebody on the

12:49.120 --> 12:51.000
 other side of planet Earth.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.960
 You can judge them if you have a standard.

12:52.960 --> 12:57.560
 And my standard, and I think the right standard, is human well being.

12:57.560 --> 13:03.600
 That which is good for human beings, qua human beings, is the standard by which we judge.

13:03.600 --> 13:07.960
 I can say that certain periods of history were bad.

13:07.960 --> 13:08.960
 They happened.

13:08.960 --> 13:09.960
 It's important to study them.

13:09.960 --> 13:14.460
 It's important to understand what they did that made them bad so we cannot do that again.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.640
 And I can say certain cultures, certain periods in time were good.

13:17.640 --> 13:18.640
 Why?

13:18.640 --> 13:21.480
 Because they promoted human well being and human flourishing.

13:21.480 --> 13:22.480
 That's the standard.

13:22.480 --> 13:26.280
 To derive from that, okay, what is it that made a particular culture good?

13:26.280 --> 13:30.160
 What is it that made that particular culture positive in terms of human well being and

13:30.160 --> 13:31.400
 human flourishing?

13:31.400 --> 13:32.400
 What made this bad?

13:32.400 --> 13:35.000
 And hopefully from that, I can derive a principle.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.400
 Okay, if I want human flourishing and human well being in the future, I want to be more

13:39.400 --> 13:41.360
 like these guys and less like those guys.

13:41.360 --> 13:45.400
 I want to derive what is the principle that will guide me in the future.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.680
 That's I think how human knowledge ultimately develops.

13:47.680 --> 13:53.440
 I think people often make a mistake, I'm not saying your own, but lots of people don't

13:53.440 --> 13:58.620
 actually read the original sources and so what happens is people will attack conservatives

13:58.620 --> 14:02.960
 assuming that conservatives think that whatever comes from the past is right.

14:02.960 --> 14:07.520
 And actually, it's very difficult to find a thinker who actually says something like

14:07.520 --> 14:08.520
 that.

14:08.520 --> 14:15.580
 Seldon or Burke, the big conservative theorists hooker, they're all people who understand

14:15.580 --> 14:21.880
 that the tradition carries with it mistakes that were made in the past.

14:21.880 --> 14:27.120
 And this is actually I think an important part of their empiricism is that they see

14:27.120 --> 14:31.240
 the search for truth as something a society does by trial and error.

14:31.240 --> 14:36.600
 And what that means is that in any given moment, you have to be aware of the possibility that

14:36.600 --> 14:39.840
 things that you've inherited are actually false.

14:39.840 --> 14:46.400
 And the job of the political thinker or the jurist or the philosopher is not to dig in

14:46.400 --> 14:50.080
 and say whatever it is that we've inherited is right.

14:50.080 --> 14:57.120
 The job is to look at the society as a whole and say, look, we have this job of first of

14:57.120 --> 15:01.280
 all conservation, just making sure that we don't lose good things that we've had.

15:01.280 --> 15:06.080
 And second, seeing if we can repair things in order to improve them where it's necessary

15:06.080 --> 15:07.920
 or where it's possible.

15:07.920 --> 15:11.000
 And that process is actually a creative process.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.160
 This is a way in which I think it is similar to Jeroen's philosophy that you take the

15:15.160 --> 15:21.120
 inherited tradition and you look for a way that you can shape it in order to make it

15:21.120 --> 15:25.760
 something better than it was.

15:25.760 --> 15:28.120
 That's a baseline for what we call conservatism.

15:28.120 --> 15:29.120
 It's not, yeah.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.120
 Just a comment.

15:30.120 --> 15:35.120
 So the trial and error, the errors is, you're proud of the errors.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.000
 It's a feature, not a bug.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.320
 So you mentioned trial and error a few times yesterday, it's a really interesting kind

15:40.320 --> 15:41.600
 of idea.

15:41.600 --> 15:48.120
 It's basically accepting that the journey is going to have flaws as opposed to saying,

15:48.120 --> 15:55.640
 I mean, the conclusion there is the current system is flawed and it will always be flawed

15:55.640 --> 15:57.440
 and you try to improve it.

15:57.440 --> 16:06.060
 When you listen to your on talk, there's much more of an optimism for the system being perfect

16:06.060 --> 16:09.640
 now or potentially soon, or it could be perfect.

16:09.640 --> 16:15.580
 And to me, the way I heard it is almost like accepting that the system is flawed and through

16:15.580 --> 16:25.980
 trial and error will improve and Jeroen says, no, we can have a perfection now.

16:25.980 --> 16:27.240
 That's the way it sounds to me.

16:27.240 --> 16:28.240
 Yeah.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.240
 And I think that's right.

16:29.240 --> 16:34.880
 I think the difference is that at some point, just like in science, I think one can stop

16:34.880 --> 16:40.160
 the trial and error and say, I can now see a pattern here.

16:40.160 --> 16:45.920
 I can see that certain actions lead to bad consequences, certain actions lead to good

16:45.920 --> 16:47.240
 consequences.

16:47.240 --> 16:54.000
 Let me try to abstract away what is it that is good and what is it that is bad and build

16:54.000 --> 16:56.920
 a system around what is good and reject what is bad.

16:56.920 --> 17:00.760
 I think ultimately, if you read the founding fathers and whether we call them conservatives

17:00.760 --> 17:05.080
 or individuals, what the founding fathers actually did, all of them, I think, is study

17:05.080 --> 17:06.080
 history.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.080
 They all did.

17:07.080 --> 17:08.080
 They all talk about history.

17:08.080 --> 17:14.480
 They all talk about examples of other cultures, whether they go back to the Republic in Venice

17:14.480 --> 17:17.840
 or back to the ancient Greeks.

17:17.840 --> 17:18.840
 They studied these.

17:18.840 --> 17:20.800
 They learned lessons from them.

17:20.800 --> 17:24.560
 They try to figure out what has worked in the past and what hasn't and try to derive

17:24.560 --> 17:25.560
 principles.

17:25.560 --> 17:32.440
 They got pretty close to what I would consider kind of an ideal, but they didn't get it

17:32.440 --> 17:33.720
 completely right.

17:33.720 --> 17:38.360
 Here we sit 200 and something years after the Declaration and after the Constitution.

17:38.360 --> 17:41.320
 I think we can look back and say, okay, well, what did they get right?

17:41.320 --> 17:47.040
 What did they get wrong based on how is it done and where are the flaws and we can improve

17:47.040 --> 17:48.320
 on it.

17:48.320 --> 17:56.680
 I think we can get closer to perfection based on those kind of observations, based on that

17:56.680 --> 18:00.640
 kind of abstraction, that kind of discovery of what is true.

18:00.640 --> 18:05.120
 Just like at some point, you do the experiments, you do the trial and error, and now you come

18:05.120 --> 18:07.160
 up with a scientific principle.

18:07.160 --> 18:11.600
 It is true that 100 years later, you might discover that, hey, I missed something, there's

18:11.600 --> 18:19.720
 something, but to not take the full lesson, to insist on incrementalism, to insist on

18:19.720 --> 18:23.280
 we're just going to tinker with the system instead of saying, no, there's something really

18:23.280 --> 18:30.400
 wrong with having a king, there's something really wrong with not having any representation,

18:30.400 --> 18:36.920
 whatever the standard needs to be in the name of we don't want to move too fast, I think

18:36.920 --> 18:37.920
 is a mistake.

18:37.920 --> 18:45.120
 The problem with trial and error in politics is that we're talking about human life, right?

18:45.120 --> 18:51.440
 So there was a big trial around communism, and 100 million people paid the price for

18:51.440 --> 18:52.440
 the trial.

18:52.440 --> 18:56.520
 I could have told them in advance, as did many people, that it would not work.

18:56.520 --> 19:01.440
 There are principles of human nature, principles that we can study from history, principles

19:01.440 --> 19:04.160
 about economics and other aspects.

19:04.160 --> 19:05.160
 Well, we know it's not going to work.

19:05.160 --> 19:06.680
 You don't need to try it again.

19:06.680 --> 19:09.920
 We've had communal arrangements throughout history.

19:09.920 --> 19:13.920
 There was an experiment with fascism, and there have been experiments with all kinds

19:13.920 --> 19:15.560
 of political systems.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.480
 Okay, we've done them.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.700
 Sad that we did them, because many of us knew they wouldn't work.

19:20.700 --> 19:26.560
 We should learn the lesson, and I think that all of history now converges on one lesson,

19:26.560 --> 19:31.060
 and that is what we need to do is build systems that protect individual freedom.

19:31.060 --> 19:32.100
 That is the core.

19:32.100 --> 19:36.960
 That's what ultimately leads to human flourishing and human success and human achievement, and

19:36.960 --> 19:41.040
 to the extent that we place anything above that individual, whether it's the state, whether

19:41.040 --> 19:45.720
 it's the ethnicity, whether it's the race, whether it's the bourgeois, whatever it happens

19:45.720 --> 19:49.960
 to be, class or whatever, whenever we place something above the individual, the consequence

19:49.960 --> 19:50.960
 is negative.

19:50.960 --> 19:57.760
 That's one of these principles that I think we can derive from studying 3,000 years of

19:57.760 --> 20:00.760
 civilization.

20:00.760 --> 20:03.680
 It's tragic, I think, because we're going to keep experimenting, sadly.

20:03.680 --> 20:04.840
 I see it, right?

20:04.840 --> 20:06.960
 I'm not winning this battle.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.560
 I'm losing the battle.

20:08.560 --> 20:11.400
 We're going to keep experimenting with different forms of collectivism, and we're going to

20:11.400 --> 20:17.000
 keep paying the price in human life and in missed opportunities for human flourishing

20:17.000 --> 20:21.040
 and human success and human wealth and prosperity.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.480
 Let's take communism as a good example.

20:23.480 --> 20:27.400
 None of the major conservative thinkers would say, you know what's a good idea?

20:27.400 --> 20:33.760
 A good idea would be to experiment by raising everything that we've inherited and starting

20:33.760 --> 20:34.760
 from scratch.

20:34.760 --> 20:40.520
 I mean, that's the conservative complaint or accusation against rationalists as opposed

20:40.520 --> 20:41.520
 to empiricists.

20:41.520 --> 20:46.880
 I mean, using rationalism, let's take Descartes kind of as a benchmark.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.280
 Can you also maybe define rationalism?

20:49.280 --> 20:50.280
 Yeah.

20:50.280 --> 20:54.920
 These are two terms that are in philosophy, especially in epistemology.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.080
 They're often compared to one another.

20:58.080 --> 21:04.000
 Jeroen said that it's a false dichotomy, and maybe it is a bit exaggerated, but that doesn't

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
 mean it's not useful for conceptualizing the domain.

21:08.000 --> 21:15.880
 So a rationalist is somebody like Descartes who says, I'm going to set aside, I'm going

21:15.880 --> 21:20.960
 to try to set aside everything I know, everything I've inherited, I'm going to start from scratch.

21:20.960 --> 21:27.800
 And he explicitly says, in evaluating the inheritance of the past, he explicitly says,

21:27.800 --> 21:30.600
 you take a look at the histories that we have, they're not reliable.

21:30.600 --> 21:34.680
 You take a look at the moral and the scientific writings that we receive, they're not very

21:34.680 --> 21:35.680
 good.

21:35.680 --> 21:41.740
 His baseline is to look very critically at the past and say, look, I'm evaluating it.

21:41.740 --> 21:44.660
 I think all in all, it's just not worth very much.

21:44.660 --> 21:50.840
 And so whatever I do, beginning from scratch, is going to be better as long as, and here's

21:50.840 --> 21:59.240
 his caveat, as long as I'm proceeding from self evident assumptions, from self evident

21:59.240 --> 22:01.120
 premises, things that you can't argue against.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.080
 I think, therefore, I am.

22:03.080 --> 22:07.400
 And then from there, deducing what he calls infallible conclusions.

22:07.400 --> 22:14.160
 So that model of self evident premises to infallible conclusions, I'm calling that rationalism,

22:14.160 --> 22:19.440
 I think that's kind of a standard academic jargon term.

22:19.440 --> 22:27.440
 And it's opposed to empiricism, which is a thinker, I think in universities, usually

22:27.440 --> 22:30.240
 the empiricist is David Hume.

22:30.240 --> 22:36.560
 And David Hume will say, we can't learn anything the way that Descartes said.

22:36.560 --> 22:40.520
 There is nothing that's that self evident and that infallible.

22:40.520 --> 22:50.040
 So Hume proposes, based on Newton and Boyle and the new physical sciences.

22:50.040 --> 22:53.200
 So Hume proposes a science of man.

22:53.200 --> 22:56.240
 And the science of man sounds an awful lot like what Yaron just said, which is we're

22:56.240 --> 23:01.640
 going to take a look at human nature, at the nature of societies.

23:01.640 --> 23:06.440
 Human nature, we're going to try to abstract towards fixed principles for describing it.

23:06.440 --> 23:09.040
 Human societies, we're going to try to do the same thing.

23:09.040 --> 23:13.720
 And from there, we get, for example, contemporary economics.

23:13.720 --> 23:19.260
 But we also get sociology and anthropology, which cut in a different direction.

23:19.260 --> 23:23.400
 So that's rationalism versus empiricism.

23:23.400 --> 23:24.400
 Can I just say?

23:24.400 --> 23:25.400
 Yeah, go ahead, please.

23:25.400 --> 23:26.400
 Yeah, I agree with that.

23:26.400 --> 23:33.560
 I think empiricism, the one thing I disagree is I think empiricism rarely comes to these

23:33.560 --> 23:34.560
 abstractions.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.440
 I mean, they want more facts.

23:36.440 --> 23:39.840
 It's always about collecting more evidence.

23:39.840 --> 23:48.120
 But this is where I think Ayn Rand is so unusual and where I think there's something new here.

23:48.120 --> 23:50.360
 And that's a bold statement given the history of philosophy.

23:50.360 --> 23:53.480
 But I think Ayn Rand is something new.

23:53.480 --> 23:59.520
 And so she says, yes, we agree about rationalism and that it's inherently wrong.

23:59.520 --> 24:03.340
 Empiricism has the problem of, OK, where does it lead?

24:03.340 --> 24:04.400
 You never come to a conclusion.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.280
 You're just accumulating evidence.

24:06.280 --> 24:07.760
 There's something in addition.

24:07.760 --> 24:14.400
 There's a third alternative, which she is positing, which is using empirical evidence,

24:14.400 --> 24:18.800
 not denying empirical evidence, recognizing that there are some axioms, there are some

24:18.800 --> 24:24.640
 axioms that we all, at the base of all of our knowledge, that are starting points.

24:24.640 --> 24:27.340
 We're not rejecting axiomatic knowledge.

24:27.340 --> 24:32.240
 And integrating those two and identifying the fact that based on these axioms and based

24:32.240 --> 24:36.960
 on these empirical evidence, we can come to truths.

24:36.960 --> 24:40.000
 Just again, like we do in science, we have certain axioms, scientific axioms, we have

24:40.000 --> 24:44.660
 certain experiments that we run, and then we can come to some identification of a truth.

24:44.660 --> 24:48.900
 And that truth is always going to be challenged by new information, by new knowledge.

24:48.900 --> 24:52.760
 But as long as that's what we know, that is what truth is.

24:52.760 --> 24:58.920
 So truth is contextual in the sense that it's contextual, it's based on that knowledge that

24:58.920 --> 24:59.920
 surrounds it.

24:59.920 --> 25:02.360
 It's always available to change if you get new facts.

25:02.360 --> 25:03.360
 Absolutely.

25:03.360 --> 25:07.160
 It's always available to change if the facts that you get, and they really are, I mean,

25:07.160 --> 25:12.320
 the burden of changing what you've come to a conclusion of truth is high, so you'd have

25:12.320 --> 25:16.260
 to have real evidence that it's not true, but that happens all the time.

25:16.260 --> 25:17.680
 So it happens in science, right?

25:17.680 --> 25:22.000
 We discovered that what we thought was true is not true, and it can happen in politics

25:22.000 --> 25:27.400
 and ethics even more so than in science because they're much messier fields.

25:27.400 --> 25:33.800
 But the idea is that you can come to a truth, but it's not just deductive.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.200
 Most truths are inductive.

25:36.200 --> 25:41.680
 We learn from observing reality and, again, coming to principles about what works and

25:41.680 --> 25:42.680
 what's not.

25:42.680 --> 25:46.080
 And here I think this is—Ayn Rand is different.

25:46.080 --> 25:49.600
 She doesn't fall into the—and she's different in her politics, and she's different in

25:49.600 --> 25:50.600
 her epistemology.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.560
 She doesn't fall into the conventional view.

25:53.560 --> 25:57.840
 She's an opponent of Hume, and she's an opponent of Descartes, and she's certainly

25:57.840 --> 26:01.040
 an opponent of Kant.

26:01.040 --> 26:03.600
 And I think she's right, right?

26:03.600 --> 26:04.600
 So—

26:04.600 --> 26:09.440
 If it's okay, can we walk back to criticism of communism?

26:09.440 --> 26:12.520
 You're both critics of communism and socialism.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.120
 Why did communism fail?

26:14.120 --> 26:21.640
 You started to say that conservatives criticize it on the basis of rationalism, that you're

26:21.640 --> 26:22.640
 throwing away the past.

26:22.640 --> 26:24.640
 You're starting from scratch.

26:24.640 --> 26:27.440
 Is that the fundamental description of why communism failed?

26:27.440 --> 26:33.900
 I think the fundamental difference between rationalists and empiricists is the question

26:33.900 --> 26:36.120
 of whether you're throwing away the past.

26:36.120 --> 26:37.720
 That's the argument.

26:37.720 --> 26:43.720
 And it cashes out as a distinction between abstract, universal, rationalist political

26:43.720 --> 26:48.400
 theories and empirical political theories.

26:48.400 --> 26:57.320
 Artificial political theories, they're always going to say something like, look, there are

26:57.320 --> 26:59.420
 many different societies.

26:59.420 --> 27:06.720
 We can say that some are better and some are worse, but the problem is that there are many

27:06.720 --> 27:11.080
 different ways in which a society can be better or worse.

27:11.080 --> 27:15.040
 There's an ongoing competition, and we're learning on an ongoing basis what are the

27:15.040 --> 27:17.820
 ways in which societies can be better and worse.

27:17.820 --> 27:24.520
 That creates a kind of, I'd say, a mild skepticism, a moderate skepticism among conservatives.

27:24.520 --> 27:29.120
 I don't think too many conservatives have a problem looking at the Soviet Union, which

27:29.120 --> 27:36.880
 is brutal and murderous, ineffective in its economics, totally ineffective spiritually,

27:36.880 --> 27:38.680
 and then collapsed.

27:38.680 --> 27:40.000
 Okay.

27:40.000 --> 27:45.660
 So I think it's easier for us to look at a system like that and say, what on earth?

27:45.660 --> 27:47.540
 What should we learn from that?

27:47.540 --> 27:53.440
 But the main conservative tradition is pretty tolerant of a diversity of different kinds

27:53.440 --> 28:00.080
 of society and is slow to insist that France is so tyrannical, it just needs a revolution

28:00.080 --> 28:03.160
 because what's going to come after the revolution is going to be much better.

28:03.160 --> 28:09.560
 The assumption is that there's lots of things that are good about most societies and that

28:09.560 --> 28:16.560
 a clean slate leads you to throw out all of the inherited things that you don't even know

28:16.560 --> 28:17.960
 how to notice until they're gone.

28:17.960 --> 28:18.960
 LW.

28:18.960 --> 28:23.080
 Could I actually play devil's advocate here and address something you also said?

28:23.080 --> 28:29.280
 Can we, as opposed to knowing the empirical data of the 20th century that communism presented,

28:29.280 --> 28:32.920
 can we go back to the beginning of the 20th century?

28:32.920 --> 28:39.420
 Can you empathize or steel man or put yourself in a place of the Soviet Union where the workers

28:39.420 --> 28:41.800
 are being disrespected?

28:41.800 --> 28:48.040
 And can you not see that the conservatives could be pro communism?

28:48.040 --> 28:53.640
 Communism is such a strongly negative word in modern day political discourse that you

28:53.640 --> 29:05.240
 have to put yourself in the mind of people who like red colors, it's all about the branding,

29:05.240 --> 29:15.440
 I think, but also like the ideas of solidarity, of nation, of togetherness, of respect for

29:15.440 --> 29:16.440
 fellow man.

29:16.440 --> 29:23.200
 I mean, all of these things that communism represents, can you not see that this idea

29:23.200 --> 29:26.780
 is actually going along with conservatism?

29:26.780 --> 29:34.600
 It is in some ways respecting the deep ideals of the past, but proposing a new way to raise

29:34.600 --> 29:37.880
 those ideals, implement those ideals in the system.

29:37.880 --> 29:43.000
 Yes, I'm going to try to do what you're suggesting, but historically we actually have a more

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
 useful option, I think, for both of our positions.

29:46.000 --> 29:52.580
 Instead of pretending that we like the actual communists, we have conservative statesmen

29:52.580 --> 30:01.680
 like Disraeli and Bismarck who initiated social legislation.

30:01.680 --> 30:08.960
 The first step towards saying, look, we're one nation, we're undergoing industrialization,

30:08.960 --> 30:15.120
 that industrialization is important and positive, but it's also doing a lot of damage to a lot

30:15.120 --> 30:16.120
 of people.

30:16.120 --> 30:20.640
 And in particular, it's doing damage not just to individuals and families, but it's doing

30:20.640 --> 30:26.880
 damage to the social fabric, the capacity of Britain or German to remain cohesive societies

30:26.880 --> 30:28.560
 is being harmed.

30:28.560 --> 30:34.080
 And so it's these two conservative statesmen, Disraeli and Bismarck, who actually take the

30:34.080 --> 30:40.800
 first steps in order to legislate for what today we would consider to be minimal social

30:40.800 --> 30:45.040
 programs, pensions and disability insurance and those kinds of things.

30:45.040 --> 30:53.320
 So for sure, conservatives do look at industrialization as a rapid change and they say, we do have

30:53.320 --> 30:57.480
 to care about the nation as a whole and we have to care about it as a unit.

30:57.480 --> 31:02.980
 And I assume that your own will say, look, that's the first step towards the catastrophe

31:02.980 --> 31:04.560
 of communism.

31:04.560 --> 31:11.320
 But before your own drives that nail into the coffin, let me try to make a distinction

31:11.320 --> 31:17.320
 because when you read Marx, you're reading an intellectual descendant of Descartes.

31:17.320 --> 31:27.120
 You're reading somebody who says, look, every society consists of oppressors and oppressed.

31:27.120 --> 31:31.720
 And that's an improvement in some ways over liberal thinking because at least he's seeing

31:31.720 --> 31:35.200
 groups as a real social phenomenon.

31:35.200 --> 31:38.920
 But he says, every society has an oppressor class and oppressed class.

31:38.920 --> 31:42.680
 They're different classes, they're different groups, and whenever one is stronger, it exploits

31:42.680 --> 31:45.440
 the ones that are weaker.

31:45.440 --> 31:50.920
 That is the foundation of a revolutionary political theory.

31:50.920 --> 31:51.920
 Why?

31:51.920 --> 31:56.120
 Because the moment that you say that the only relationship between the stronger and the

31:56.120 --> 31:58.680
 weaker is exploitation.

31:58.680 --> 32:02.840
 The moment that you say that, then you're pushed into the position and Marx and Engels

32:02.840 --> 32:04.880
 say this explicitly, you're pushed into the position.

32:04.880 --> 32:07.940
 We're saying, when will the exploitation end?

32:07.940 --> 32:09.300
 Never until there's a revolution.

32:09.300 --> 32:10.640
 What happens when there's a revolution?

32:10.640 --> 32:12.920
 You eliminate the oppressor class.

32:12.920 --> 32:13.920
 It's annihilationist.

32:13.920 --> 32:20.400
 I mean, you can immediately when you read it, see why it's different from Descartes

32:20.400 --> 32:25.300
 or Bismarck because they're trying to keep everybody somehow at peace with one another.

32:25.300 --> 32:27.800
 And Marx is saying, there is no peace.

32:27.800 --> 32:30.440
 That oppressor class has to be annihilated.

32:30.440 --> 32:34.400
 And then they go ahead and do it, and they kill 100 million people.

32:34.400 --> 32:40.320
 So I do think that despite the fact your question is good and right, there are certain similarities

32:40.320 --> 32:43.320
 and concern, but still I think you can tell the difference.

32:43.320 --> 32:48.040
 That extra step of revolution to you is where the problem comes.

32:48.040 --> 32:52.880
 That extra step of let's kill all the oppressors, that's the problem.

32:52.880 --> 32:56.520
 And then to you, the whole step one is the problem.

32:56.520 --> 32:58.120
 Well, it's all a problem.

32:58.120 --> 33:05.440
 First I don't view communism as something that radical in a sense that I think it comes

33:05.440 --> 33:07.960
 from a tradition of collectivism.

33:07.960 --> 33:12.160
 I think it comes from a tradition of looking at groups and measuring things in terms of

33:12.160 --> 33:13.220
 groups.

33:13.220 --> 33:17.200
 It comes from tradition where you expect some people to be sacrificed for the greater good

33:17.200 --> 33:19.400
 of the whole.

33:19.400 --> 33:28.760
 I think it comes from a tradition where mysticism or revelation as the source of truth is accepted.

33:28.760 --> 33:31.800
 I view Marx as in some sense very Christian.

33:31.800 --> 33:38.680
 I don't think he's this radical rejecting, I think he's just reformatting Christianity

33:38.680 --> 33:39.680
 in a sense.

33:39.680 --> 33:43.620
 In a sense he's replacing God with the proletarian.

33:43.620 --> 33:48.400
 Knowledge you have to get knowledge from somewhere, so you need the dictatorship of the proletarian,

33:48.400 --> 33:53.880
 you need somebody, the Stalin, the Lenin who somehow communes with the spirit, the spirit

33:53.880 --> 33:54.880
 of the proletarian.

33:54.880 --> 33:59.760
 There's no rationality, not rationalism, there's no rationality in Marx.

33:59.760 --> 34:04.880
 There is a lot of mysticism and there is a lot of hand waving and there's a lot of sacrifice

34:04.880 --> 34:08.160
 and a lot of original sin in the way he views humanity.

34:08.160 --> 34:14.960
 So I view Marx as one more collectivist in a whole string of collectivists.

34:14.960 --> 34:23.760
 And I think the Bismarckian response, I know less about Disraeli so I'll focus on Bismarck,

34:23.760 --> 34:29.480
 and Bismarck is really responding to political pressures from the left and he's responding

34:29.480 --> 34:36.520
 to the rise of communism, socialism, but what Bismarck is doing, he's putting something

34:36.520 --> 34:42.280
 alternative, he's presenting an alternative to the proletarian as the standard by which

34:42.280 --> 34:45.800
 we should measure the good.

34:45.800 --> 34:50.120
 And what he's replacing it as the state, he's replacing the proletarian with the state,

34:50.120 --> 34:52.380
 and that has exactly the same problems.

34:52.380 --> 34:56.120
 That is first it requires sacrificing some to others, which is what the welfare state

34:56.120 --> 34:59.240
 basically legitimizes.

34:59.240 --> 35:03.280
 It places the state above all, so the state now becomes I think the biggest evil of Bismarck

35:03.280 --> 35:08.520
 and I definitely view him as a negative force in history, is public education.

35:08.520 --> 35:14.440
 I mean the Germans really dig in on public education, really develop it, and really the

35:14.440 --> 35:20.940
 American model of public education is copying the German, the Prussian Bismarckian public

35:20.940 --> 35:21.940
 education.

35:21.940 --> 35:27.080
 Can you speak to that real quick, why the public education is such a root of moral evil

35:27.080 --> 35:28.080
 for you?

35:28.080 --> 35:33.520
 Well because it now says that there's one standard and that standard is determined by

35:33.520 --> 35:39.760
 government, by a bureaucracy, by whatever the government deems is in the national interest,

35:39.760 --> 35:41.200
 and Bismarck is very explicit about this.

35:41.200 --> 35:47.440
 He's training the workers of the future, they need to catch up with England and other places

35:47.440 --> 35:52.000
 and they need to train the workers and he's going to train some people to be the managerial

35:52.000 --> 35:55.440
 classes, he's going to train other people to be – and he decides, right, the government,

35:55.440 --> 35:58.400
 the bureaucracy is going to decide who's who and where they go.

35:58.400 --> 36:03.920
 There's no individual choice, there's no individual showing an ability to break out of what the

36:03.920 --> 36:08.520
 government has decided is their little box, there's very little freedom, there's very

36:08.520 --> 36:12.760
 little – you know, ultimately there's very little competition, there's very little

36:12.760 --> 36:16.240
 innovation, and this is the problem we have today in American education, which we can

36:16.240 --> 36:18.760
 get to, is there's no competition and no innovation.

36:18.760 --> 36:23.320
 We have one standard, fit all, and then we have conflicts about what should be taught,

36:23.320 --> 36:28.680
 and the conflicts now are not pedagogical, they're not about what works and what doesn't.

36:28.680 --> 36:29.680
 Nobody cares about that.

36:29.680 --> 36:33.880
 It's about political agendas, right, it's about what my group wants to be taught and

36:33.880 --> 36:38.400
 what that group wants to be taught, rather than actually discovering how do we get kids

36:38.400 --> 36:39.400
 to read?

36:39.400 --> 36:42.360
 I mean, we all know how to get kids to read, but there's a political agenda around not

36:42.360 --> 36:44.160
 teaching phonics, for example.

36:44.160 --> 36:48.080
 So a lot of schools don't teach phonics, even though the kids will never learn how

36:48.080 --> 36:49.280
 to read properly.

36:49.280 --> 36:53.440
 So it becomes politics, and I don't believe politics belongs in education.

36:53.440 --> 36:58.080
 I think education is a product, it's a service, and we know how to deliver products and services

36:58.080 --> 37:02.440
 really, really efficiently at a really, really low price at a really, really high quality,

37:02.440 --> 37:04.760
 and that's leaving it to the market to do.

37:04.760 --> 37:12.280
 But your fundamental criticism is that the state can use education to further its authoritarian

37:12.280 --> 37:13.280
 aims.

37:13.280 --> 37:17.880
 Well, or whatever the aims – I mean, think about the conservative today critique of American

37:17.880 --> 37:20.320
 educational system, right, it's dominated by the left.

37:20.320 --> 37:23.040
 Yeah, what did you expect, right?

37:23.040 --> 37:28.640
 If you leave it up to the state to fund, they're going to fund the things that promote state

37:28.640 --> 37:31.640
 growth and state intervention, and the left is better at that.

37:31.640 --> 37:36.840
 It has been better at that than the right, and they now dominate our educational institutions.

37:36.840 --> 37:41.640
 But look, if we go back to Bismarck, my problem is placing the state above the individual.

37:41.640 --> 37:46.960
 So if communism places the class above the individual, what matters is class, individuals,

37:46.960 --> 37:49.880
 and nothing, they're cogs in a machine.

37:49.880 --> 37:53.720
 Bismarck, certainly the German tradition much more than the British tradition or the American

37:53.720 --> 37:56.880
 tradition, the German tradition is to place the state above the individual.

37:56.880 --> 38:01.040
 I think that's equally evil, and the outcome is fascism, and the outcome is the same.

38:01.040 --> 38:06.040
 The outcome is the deaths of tens of millions of people when taken to its ultimate conclusion.

38:06.040 --> 38:12.640
 Just like socialism, the ultimate conclusion of it is communism, you know, nationalism

38:12.640 --> 38:18.300
 in that form, kind of the Bismarckian form, the ultimate conclusion is Nazism or some

38:18.300 --> 38:20.680
 form of fascism.

38:20.680 --> 38:23.840
 Because you don't care about the individual, the individual doesn't matter.

38:23.840 --> 38:29.720
 I think this is one of the differences in the Anglo, you know, Anglo American tradition

38:29.720 --> 38:35.080
 where the Anglo American tradition, even the conservatives, have always acknowledged and

38:35.080 --> 38:36.080
 it goes back to...

38:36.080 --> 38:37.080
 Especially the conservatives.

38:37.080 --> 38:38.080
 Yes.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.080
 Well...

38:39.080 --> 38:40.080
 The conservatives were there first.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.080
 They acknowledged.

38:41.080 --> 38:45.360
 Well, you've defined conservatives to include all the good thinkers of the distant past,

38:45.360 --> 38:46.680
 and they're all good thinkers.

38:46.680 --> 38:47.680
 We agree on that.

38:47.680 --> 38:51.360
 I'm defining conservatism the way that Burke does.

38:51.360 --> 38:52.360
 I'm just...

38:52.360 --> 38:55.080
 Look, this is a very simple observation.

38:55.080 --> 38:58.760
 Burke thinks, when you open Burke and you actually read him, he starts naming all of

38:58.760 --> 39:00.400
 these people who he's defending.

39:00.400 --> 39:05.000
 And it's bizarre, I'm sorry, it's just intellectual sloppiness for people to be publishing books

39:05.000 --> 39:08.840
 called Burke, The First Conservative, The Founding Conservative, The Found...

39:08.840 --> 39:15.080
 I mean, this is nonstop, it's a view that says Burke reacts to the French Revolution,

39:15.080 --> 39:18.880
 so conservatism has no prior tradition, it's just reacting to the French Revolution.

39:18.880 --> 39:19.880
 And this is...

39:19.880 --> 39:20.880
 I mean, this is just absurd.

39:20.880 --> 39:23.640
 Can I ask a quick question on conservatism?

39:23.640 --> 39:27.480
 Are there any conservatives that are embracing of revolutions?

39:27.480 --> 39:30.880
 So are they ultimately against the concept of revolution?

39:30.880 --> 39:36.480
 Yes, Burke himself embraces the Polish Revolution, which takes place almost exactly at the same

39:36.480 --> 39:38.580
 time as the French Revolution.

39:38.580 --> 39:42.800
 And the argument is really interesting because there's a common mistake is assuming that

39:42.800 --> 39:46.760
 Burke and conservative thinkers are always in favor of slow change.

39:46.760 --> 39:51.240
 I think that's also just factually mistaken.

39:51.240 --> 39:57.320
 Burke is against the French Revolution because he thinks that there are actually tried and

39:57.320 --> 40:04.400
 true things that work, things that work for human flourishing and freedom included as

40:04.400 --> 40:07.900
 a very important part of human flourishing.

40:07.900 --> 40:17.160
 He like many others takes the English constitution to be a model of something that works.

40:17.160 --> 40:21.440
 So it has a king, it has various other things that maybe your own will say, well, that's

40:21.440 --> 40:26.400
 a mistake, but still for centuries, it's the leader in many things that I think we can

40:26.400 --> 40:29.320
 easily agree are human flourishing.

40:29.320 --> 40:33.040
 And Burke says, look, what's wrong with the French Revolution?

40:33.040 --> 40:37.540
 What's wrong with the French Revolution is that they have a system that has all sorts

40:37.540 --> 40:40.960
 of problems, but they could be repairing it.

40:40.960 --> 40:45.680
 And instead what they're doing by overthrowing everything is they're moving away from what

40:45.680 --> 40:48.360
 we know is good for human beings.

40:48.360 --> 40:52.120
 Then he looks at the Polish Revolution and he says, the Poles do the opposite.

40:52.120 --> 40:55.520
 The Poles have a nonfunctioning traditional constitution.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.280
 It's too democratic.

40:57.280 --> 41:03.840
 It's impossible to raise armies and to defend the country because of the fact that every

41:03.840 --> 41:05.760
 nobleman has a veto.

41:05.760 --> 41:11.320
 So the Polish Revolution moves in the direction of the British constitution.

41:11.320 --> 41:16.380
 They repair their constitution through a quick, a rapid revolution.

41:16.380 --> 41:21.240
 They install a king along the model that looks a lot like Britain and Burke supports it.

41:21.240 --> 41:23.960
 He says, this is a good revolution.

41:23.960 --> 41:31.080
 So it's not the need to quickly make a change in order to save yourself.

41:31.080 --> 41:33.240
 That's not what conservatives are objecting to.

41:33.240 --> 41:40.400
 What they're objecting to is instead of looking at experience in order to try to make a slow

41:40.400 --> 41:45.920
 or quick improvement, a measured improvement to achieve a particular goal, instead of doing

41:45.920 --> 41:48.680
 that, you say, look, the whole thing has just been wrong.

41:48.680 --> 41:51.960
 And what we've really got to do is annihilate a certain part of the population and then

41:51.960 --> 41:55.280
 make completely new laws and a completely new theory.

41:55.280 --> 41:56.560
 That's what he's objecting to.

41:56.560 --> 41:57.560
 That's the French Revolution.

41:57.560 --> 42:01.720
 And that then becomes the model for communist revolutions.

42:01.720 --> 42:06.400
 And for me, I mean, the French Revolution is clearly a real evil and wrong, but it's

42:06.400 --> 42:09.800
 not that it was a revolution and it's not that it tried to change everything.

42:09.800 --> 42:13.640
 I mean, let's remember what was going on in France at the time and people were starving

42:13.640 --> 42:18.540
 and the monarchy in particular was completely detached, completely detached from the suffering

42:18.540 --> 42:22.120
 of the people and something needed to change.

42:22.120 --> 42:30.320
 The unfortunate thing is that the change was motivated by an egalitarian philosophy, not

42:30.320 --> 42:33.880
 egalitarian in the sense that I think the Fauny Fathers talked about, but egalitarian

42:33.880 --> 42:40.080
 in the sense of real equality, equality of outcome, motivated by a philosophy, by Rousseau's

42:40.080 --> 42:44.240
 philosophy, and inevitably led, you could tell that the ideas were going to lead to

42:44.240 --> 42:48.920
 this, to massive destruction and death and the annihilation of a class.

42:48.920 --> 42:51.560
 You can't, annihilation is never an option.

42:51.560 --> 42:58.560
 That is, it's not true that a good revolution never leads to mass death of just whole groups

42:58.560 --> 43:01.920
 of people because a good revolution is about the sanctity of the individual.

43:01.920 --> 43:04.880
 It's about preservation, liberty of the individual.

43:04.880 --> 43:10.300
 And again, that goes back to, and the French Revolution denies and Rousseau denies really

43:10.300 --> 43:13.560
 that in civilization there is a value in a thing called the individual.

43:13.560 --> 43:18.080
 I think this is a good place to have this discussion.

43:18.080 --> 43:26.260
 The Fauny Fathers of the United States, are they individualists or are they conservatives?

43:26.260 --> 43:31.240
 So in this particular revolution that founded this country, at the core of which are some

43:31.240 --> 43:38.600
 fascinating, some powerful ideas, were those founding fathers, were those ideas coming

43:38.600 --> 43:45.400
 from a place of conservatism or did they put primary value into the freedom and the power

43:45.400 --> 43:46.400
 of the individual?

43:46.400 --> 43:47.640
 What do you think?

43:47.640 --> 43:48.640
 There were both.

43:48.640 --> 43:54.400
 I mean, this is something that's a little bit difficult sometimes for Americans, I mean,

43:54.400 --> 43:58.960
 very educated Americans, they talk about the founding fathers as though it's kind of like

43:58.960 --> 44:06.560
 this collective entity with a single brain and a single value system.

44:06.560 --> 44:12.480
 But I think at the time that's not the way any of them saw it.

44:12.480 --> 44:18.520
 So roughly there's two camps and they map onto the rationalist versus traditionalist

44:18.520 --> 44:23.520
 empiricist dichotomy that I proposed earlier.

44:23.520 --> 44:29.000
 So on the one hand, you have real revolutionaries like Jefferson and Paine.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.400
 These are the people who Burke was writing against.

44:31.400 --> 44:33.700
 These are the people who supported the French Revolution.

44:33.700 --> 44:38.640
 So when you say real, so when you say Paine, you're referring to revolutionaries in a bad

44:38.640 --> 44:40.400
 way, like this is a problem.

44:40.400 --> 44:48.080
 These are people who will say history up until now has been, with Descartes, but applied

44:48.080 --> 44:49.080
 to politics.

44:49.080 --> 44:56.600
 History up until now has been just a story of ugliness, foolishness, stupidity, and evil.

44:56.600 --> 45:03.840
 And if you apply reason, we'll all come to the same conclusions.

45:03.840 --> 45:10.360
 Paine writes a book called The Age of Reason, and The Age of Reason is a manifesto for here

45:10.360 --> 45:14.200
 is the answer to political and moral problems throughout history.

45:14.200 --> 45:15.720
 We have the answers.

45:15.720 --> 45:19.680
 And it's in the same school as Rousseau's The Social Continent.

45:19.680 --> 45:20.680
 You don't like that?

45:20.680 --> 45:21.680
 Not at all.

45:21.680 --> 45:22.680
 Well, I thought it was the opposite.

45:22.680 --> 45:23.680
 I think they're the opposite.

45:23.680 --> 45:24.680
 Okay, so let me...

45:24.680 --> 45:30.280
 Just to throw in a quick question on Jefferson and Paine, do you think America would exist

45:30.280 --> 45:32.720
 without those two figures?

45:32.720 --> 45:38.840
 So like how important is spice in the flavor of the dish you're making?

45:38.840 --> 45:43.360
 I don't want to try to run the counterfactual, I don't have confidence that I know the answer

45:43.360 --> 45:44.360
 to the question.

45:44.360 --> 45:45.360
 But it's so much fun.

45:45.360 --> 45:46.360
 You know what?

45:46.360 --> 45:49.200
 I'm going to offer something that I think is more fun.

45:49.200 --> 45:55.440
 More fun than the counterfactual is America had two revolutions, not one, okay?

45:55.440 --> 46:05.280
 At first, there is a revolution that is strongly spiced with this kind of rationalism.

46:05.280 --> 46:09.440
 And then there's a 10 year period after the Declaration of Independence.

46:09.440 --> 46:12.920
 There's a 10 year period under which America has a constitution.

46:12.920 --> 46:16.400
 This first constitution, which today they call the Articles of the Confederation, but

46:16.400 --> 46:19.420
 there's a constitution from 1777.

46:19.420 --> 46:25.760
 And that constitution is based on, in a lot of ways, on the hottest new ideas.

46:25.760 --> 46:31.640
 It has, instead of the traditional British system with a division of powers between an

46:31.640 --> 46:38.480
 executive and a bicameral legislature, instead of that traditional English model, which most

46:38.480 --> 46:42.640
 of the states had as their governments, instead of that, they say, no, we're going to have

46:42.640 --> 46:50.400
 one elected body, okay, and that body, that Congress, it's going to be the executive,

46:50.400 --> 46:54.400
 it's going to be the legislative, it's going to be everything, and it's going to run as

46:54.400 --> 46:55.920
 a big committee.

46:55.920 --> 46:57.520
 These are the ideas of the French Revolution.

46:57.520 --> 47:04.360
 You get to actually see them implemented in Pennsylvania, in the Pennsylvania Constitution,

47:04.360 --> 47:06.800
 and then later in the National Assembly in France.

47:06.800 --> 47:07.840
 It's a disaster.

47:07.840 --> 47:09.140
 The thing doesn't work.

47:09.140 --> 47:10.240
 It's completely made up.

47:10.240 --> 47:15.720
 It's neither based on historical experience, nor is it based on historical custom, on what

47:15.720 --> 47:17.240
 people are used to.

47:17.240 --> 47:23.320
 And what they succeed in creating with this first constitution is it's wonderfully rational,

47:23.320 --> 47:24.840
 but it's a complete disaster.

47:24.840 --> 47:27.440
 It doesn't allow the raising of taxes.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.240
 It doesn't allow the mustering of troops.

47:29.240 --> 47:33.640
 It doesn't allow giving orders to soldiers to fight a war.

47:33.640 --> 47:41.240
 And if that had continued, if that had continued to be the American Constitution, America never

47:41.240 --> 47:42.680
 would have been an independent country.

47:42.680 --> 47:45.400
 There I'm willing to do that counterfactual.

47:45.400 --> 47:55.880
 What happens during those years where Washington and Jay and Knox and Hamilton and Morris,

47:55.880 --> 48:02.480
 there's like this group of conservatives, they're mostly soldiers and lawyers.

48:02.480 --> 48:06.480
 This is in Washington, most of them are from northern cities.

48:06.480 --> 48:17.080
 And this group is much more conservative than the Tom Paine and Jefferson School.

48:17.080 --> 48:20.000
 Some historians call them the Nationalist Party.

48:20.000 --> 48:24.360
 Historically, they give up the word nationalism and they call themselves the Federalists,

48:24.360 --> 48:26.320
 but they're basically the Nationalist Party.

48:26.320 --> 48:27.320
 What does that mean?

48:27.320 --> 48:32.600
 It means on the one hand that their goal is to create an independent nation, independent

48:32.600 --> 48:33.600
 from Britain.

48:33.600 --> 48:41.000
 But on the other hand, they believe that they already have national legal traditions, the

48:41.000 --> 48:46.680
 common law, the forms of government that have been imported from Britain, and of course

48:46.680 --> 48:51.760
 Christianity, which they consider to be part of their inheritance.

48:51.760 --> 48:56.720
 This Federalist Party is the conservative party.

48:56.720 --> 49:00.320
 These are people who are extremely close in ideas to Burke.

49:00.320 --> 49:04.400
 And these are people who wrote the Constitution of the United States, the second constitution,

49:04.400 --> 49:11.720
 the second revolution in 1787, when Washington leads the establishment of a new constitution,

49:11.720 --> 49:17.000
 which maybe technically legally, it wasn't even legal under the old constitution, but

49:17.000 --> 49:18.540
 it was democratic.

49:18.540 --> 49:24.160
 And what it did is it said, we're going to take what we know about English government,

49:24.160 --> 49:28.560
 what we've learned by applying English government in the states, we're going to create a national

49:28.560 --> 49:32.760
 government, a unified national government, that's going to muster power in its hands,

49:32.760 --> 49:38.800
 enough power to be able to do things like fighting wars to defend a unified people.

49:38.800 --> 49:40.220
 Those are conservatives.

49:40.220 --> 49:46.160
 Now it's reasonable to say, well, look, there was no king, so how conservative could they

49:46.160 --> 49:47.160
 be?

49:47.160 --> 49:49.060
 But I think that's a reasonable question.

49:49.060 --> 49:53.400
 But don't forget that the American colonies, the English colonies in America by that point

49:53.400 --> 49:55.680
 had been around for 150 years.

49:55.680 --> 50:01.200
 They had written constitutions, they had already adapted for an entire century, adapted the

50:01.200 --> 50:06.120
 English constitution to local conditions where there's no aristocracy and there's no king.

50:06.120 --> 50:08.760
 I think you can see that as a positive thing.

50:08.760 --> 50:13.040
 On the other hand, they have slavery, that's an innovation, that's not English.

50:13.040 --> 50:17.280
 So it's a little bit different from the English constitution, but those men are conservatives.

50:17.280 --> 50:23.900
 They make the minimum changes that they need to the English constitution and they largely

50:23.900 --> 50:28.680
 replicate it, which is why the Jeffersonians hated them so much.

50:28.680 --> 50:30.220
 They call them apostates.

50:30.220 --> 50:37.640
 They say they've betrayed equality and liberty and fraternity by adopting an English style

50:37.640 --> 50:38.640
 constitution.

50:38.640 --> 50:43.760
 So I would imagine, Yaron, you would put emphasis of the success of the key ideas at the founding

50:43.760 --> 50:49.360
 of this country elsewhere, at the freedom of the individual as opposed to the tradition

50:49.360 --> 50:51.000
 of the British empire.

50:51.000 --> 50:55.040
 The one thing I agree with, Yaron, is the fact that yes, the founding fathers were not

50:55.040 --> 50:56.040
 a monolith.

50:56.040 --> 51:00.520
 They argued, they debated, they disagreed, they wrote against each other.

51:00.520 --> 51:03.880
 Jefferson and Adams for decades didn't even speak to each other, though they did make

51:03.880 --> 51:08.000
 up and had a fascinating relationship after.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
 You and I are making up too.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
 There you go.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
 It's like the founding fathers.

51:13.000 --> 51:19.140
 You know, there's this massive debate and discussion, but I don't agree with the characterization

51:19.140 --> 51:20.800
 of Paine and Jefferson.

51:20.800 --> 51:25.280
 I don't think it's just to call them rationalists because I don't think they're rationalists.

51:25.280 --> 51:29.880
 People who've looked at history, at the problems in history, and remember this is the 18th

51:29.880 --> 51:35.100
 century and they were coming out of a hundred years earlier, some of the bloodiest wars

51:35.100 --> 51:42.060
 in all of human history were happening in Europe, many of them over religion.

51:42.060 --> 51:46.840
 You know, they had seen what was going on in France and other countries where people

51:46.840 --> 51:54.680
 were starving and where kings were frolicking in palaces in spite of that.

51:54.680 --> 52:01.760
 They were very aware of the relative freedom that the British tradition had given Englishmen.

52:01.760 --> 52:06.400
 I think they knew that, they understood that, and I think they were building on that.

52:06.400 --> 52:12.120
 They were taking the observation of the past and trying to come up with a more perfect

52:12.120 --> 52:13.960
 system, and I think they did.

52:13.960 --> 52:16.440
 In that sense, I'm a huge fan of Jefferson.

52:16.440 --> 52:20.120
 You know, there are two things that I think are unfortunate about Jefferson.

52:20.120 --> 52:26.000
 One is that he continued to hold slaves, which is very unfortunate.

52:26.000 --> 52:31.800
 The second is early support for the French Revolution, which I think is a massive mistake

52:31.800 --> 52:36.760
 and I wouldn't be surprised if he regretted it later in life, given the consequences.

52:36.760 --> 52:41.840
 But they were trying to derive principles by which they could establish a new state,

52:41.840 --> 52:48.000
 and yes, there was pushback by some and there was disagreement, and the Constitution in

52:48.000 --> 52:53.280
 the end is to some extent a form of compromise, it's still one of the great documents of

52:53.280 --> 52:57.720
 all of human history, political documents, the Constitution, although I think it's

52:57.720 --> 52:59.120
 inferior to the Declaration.

52:59.120 --> 53:03.480
 I'm a huge fan of the Declaration and I think one of the mistakes the conservatives makes,

53:03.480 --> 53:09.160
 one of the mistakes the Supreme Court makes and American judiciary makes is assuming the

53:09.160 --> 53:10.360
 two documents are separate.

53:10.360 --> 53:14.240
 I think Lincoln is absolutely right, you can't understand the Constitution without understanding

53:14.240 --> 53:18.760
 the Declaration, the Declaration of what set the context and what sets everything up for

53:18.760 --> 53:20.480
 the Constitution.

53:20.480 --> 53:25.480
 Individual rights are the key concept there, and one of the challenges was that some of

53:25.480 --> 53:30.760
 the compromises, and compromise is not necessarily between groups, but compromises that even

53:30.760 --> 53:37.720
 Jefferson made and others made regarding individual rights, set America on a path that we're

53:37.720 --> 53:39.880
 suffering from today.

53:39.880 --> 53:46.760
 I mentioned three last night, one was slavery, obviously that was a horrific compromise,

53:46.760 --> 53:53.920
 one that America not just paid for with the Civil War, 600,000 young men died because

53:53.920 --> 53:58.080
 of it, but the suffering of black slaves for all those years.

53:58.080 --> 54:04.760
 But then the whole issue of racial tensions in this country for a century and to this

54:04.760 --> 54:10.320
 day really is a consequence of that initial compromise, who knows what the counterfactual

54:10.320 --> 54:14.920
 is in America if there's a Civil War right at the founding, because there would have

54:14.920 --> 54:19.320
 been a war no matter what, but if it had happened in the late 18th century, early 19th century,

54:19.320 --> 54:29.000
 rather than waiting till 1860s, but then second was Jefferson's embrace of public education,

54:29.000 --> 54:34.800
 his founding of the University of Virginia, which I think is a great tragedy, which nobody

54:34.800 --> 54:39.120
 agrees with me on, so that's one of the areas where I'm pretty radical.

54:39.120 --> 54:45.520
 And then they embrace, both by Jefferson and by Hamilton, for different reasons, but an

54:45.520 --> 54:49.360
 embrace by both of them of government role in the economy.

54:49.360 --> 54:54.080
 And I do finance, so I know a little bit about finance, and the debate between Jefferson

54:54.080 --> 54:58.680
 and Hamilton about banking is fascinating, but at the end of the day, both wanted a role

54:58.680 --> 55:04.760
 for government in banking, they both didn't trust, Jefferson didn't trust big financial

55:04.760 --> 55:08.140
 interests, Hamilton wanted to capture some of those financial interests for the state,

55:08.140 --> 55:13.960
 and as a consequence, we set America on a path where, in my view, regulation always

55:13.960 --> 55:18.160
 leads to more regulation, there's never a case where regulation decreases, and we started

55:18.160 --> 55:22.080
 out with a certain regulatory body around banks, and a recognition that it was okay

55:22.080 --> 55:26.240
 to regulate the economy, so once we get into the late 19th century, it's fine to regulate

55:26.240 --> 55:31.560
 the railroads, it's fine to pass antitrust laws, it's fine to then continue on the path

55:31.560 --> 55:36.080
 of where we are today, which is heavy, heavy, heavy, massive involvement of government in

55:36.080 --> 55:41.480
 every aspect of our economy, and really in every aspect of our life, because of education.

55:41.480 --> 55:47.080
 So I think the country was founded on certain mistakes, and we haven't been willing to

55:47.080 --> 55:52.280
 question those mistakes, and in a sense that we've only moved in the opposite direction,

55:52.280 --> 55:57.840
 and now America's become, whereas I think it was founded on the idea of the primacy

55:57.840 --> 56:02.920
 of the individual, the sanctity of the individual, at least as an idea, even if not fully implemented,

56:02.920 --> 56:08.720
 I think now that's completely lost, I don't think anybody really is an advocate out there

56:08.720 --> 56:13.040
 for individualism in politics, or for true freedom in politics.

56:13.040 --> 56:16.680
 We'll get to individualism, but let me ask the Beatles and the Rolling Stones question

56:16.680 --> 56:19.000
 about the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
 Rolling Stones.

56:20.000 --> 56:23.960
 Well, because it's like which document, Beatles or Rolling Stones, which document is more

56:23.960 --> 56:24.960
 important?

56:24.960 --> 56:25.960
 It's obviously the Beatles, right?

56:25.960 --> 56:26.960
 Okay.

56:26.960 --> 56:27.960
 Is there a question here?

56:27.960 --> 56:28.960
 Is there even a question?

56:28.960 --> 56:33.120
 But let me then even zoom in further and ask you to pick your favorite song.

56:33.120 --> 56:39.400
 So what ideas in the Constitution or the Declaration of Independence do you think are the most

56:39.400 --> 56:43.040
 important to the success of the United States of America?

56:43.040 --> 56:48.360
 I'll answer the question, but before answering the question, I want to register a dissent

56:48.360 --> 56:49.360
 from your own.

56:49.360 --> 56:50.640
 Is it the public education?

56:50.640 --> 56:51.640
 Is it which?

56:51.640 --> 56:52.640
 No, no, no.

56:52.640 --> 56:57.760
 Actually, look, we're not so far apart on public education.

56:57.760 --> 57:01.800
 I'm actually kind of surprised that you're so anti Bismarck because his public school

57:01.800 --> 57:07.240
 system, his national public school system was created in order to stick it to the church.

57:07.240 --> 57:11.080
 It was the church that ran the schools before then, and so that's a different...

57:11.080 --> 57:15.320
 I'm all for sticking it to the church, any opportunity, but not when the alternative

57:15.320 --> 57:16.320
 is the nation.

57:16.320 --> 57:21.240
 I'd rather see a free educational system where freedom is in education.

57:21.240 --> 57:22.240
 Okay.

57:22.240 --> 57:25.400
 So I want to register a dissent about Lincoln.

57:25.400 --> 57:30.800
 Look, Lincoln is an important figure and a great man, and he was presiding over a country,

57:30.800 --> 57:35.880
 which at that point was pretty Jeffersonian in terms of its self perception.

57:35.880 --> 57:37.080
 He said what he needed to say.

57:37.080 --> 57:44.000
 I'm not going to criticize him, but I don't accept the idea that the Declaration of Independence,

57:44.000 --> 57:51.160
 which starts one revolution, is of a piece with the second constitution, the constitution

57:51.160 --> 57:57.940
 of 1787, the nationalist constitution, which is effectively a counter revolution.

57:57.940 --> 58:00.360
 What happens is there is a revolution.

58:00.360 --> 58:01.920
 It's based on certain principles.

58:01.920 --> 58:03.040
 There are a lot...

58:03.040 --> 58:09.160
 Not exactly, but in many ways resembles the later ideas of the French Revolution.

58:09.160 --> 58:14.880
 And what the Federalist Party does, the Nationalist Conservative Party does, is a counter revolution

58:14.880 --> 58:18.160
 to reinstate the Old English Constitution.

58:18.160 --> 58:23.720
 So these documents are, if you're willing to accept the evidence of history, they are

58:23.720 --> 58:27.300
 in many respects contrary to one another.

58:27.300 --> 58:34.080
 And so if I'm asked what's the most important values that are handed down by these documents,

58:34.080 --> 58:41.120
 I don't have an objection to life, liberty, and property, all of which are really important

58:41.120 --> 58:42.120
 things.

58:42.120 --> 58:50.120
 I do have an objection to the pompous overreach of these are self evident, which is absurd.

58:50.120 --> 58:51.480
 They can't be self evident.

58:51.480 --> 58:56.360
 If they were self evident, then somebody would have come up with them like 2,000 years before.

58:56.360 --> 58:58.840
 It's not self evident.

58:58.840 --> 58:59.840
 So that's damaging.

58:59.840 --> 59:08.100
 I like the conservative preamble of the constitution, which describes the purposes of the national

59:08.100 --> 59:10.560
 government that's being established.

59:10.560 --> 59:19.360
 There are seven purposes, a more perfect union, which is the principle of cohesion, justice,

59:19.360 --> 59:26.640
 domestic peace, common defense, the general welfare, which is the welfare of the public

59:26.640 --> 59:31.440
 as a thing that's not only individuals, but there is such a thing as a general welfare,

59:31.440 --> 59:37.880
 liberty, which we agree is absolutely crucial, and posterity, the idea that the purpose of

59:37.880 --> 59:43.480
 the government is to be able to sustain and grow this independent nation, and not only

59:43.480 --> 59:45.840
 to guarantee rights no matter what happens.

59:45.840 --> 59:50.840
 You don't like the, we hold these truths to be self evident, so you're definitely a Beatles

59:50.840 --> 59:51.840
 guy.

59:51.840 --> 59:56.480
 You don't want the pompous, you don't need that revolutionary strength.

59:56.480 --> 1:00:05.200
 Look, I think that that expression, self evident truths, it does tremendous damage because instead

1:00:05.200 --> 1:00:11.680
 of a moderate skepticism, which says, look, we may not know everything, it says, look,

1:00:11.680 --> 1:00:12.680
 we know everything.

1:00:12.680 --> 1:00:13.680
 Here it is.

1:00:13.680 --> 1:00:14.680
 Here's what we know.

1:00:14.680 --> 1:00:15.680
 We know.

1:00:15.680 --> 1:00:16.680
 Here's what we think.

1:00:16.680 --> 1:00:19.280
 So, you know, I'll agree with you all.

1:00:19.280 --> 1:00:20.520
 I don't like self evident.

1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:22.820
 I don't like self evident because he's absolutely right.

1:00:22.820 --> 1:00:24.200
 It's not self evident.

1:00:24.200 --> 1:00:27.180
 These are massive achievements.

1:00:27.180 --> 1:00:33.200
 These are massive achievements of enlightened thinking, of studying history, of understanding

1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:40.440
 human nature, of deriving a truth from 3,000 years of historical knowledge and a better

1:00:40.440 --> 1:00:43.480
 understanding of human nature and a capacity.

1:00:43.480 --> 1:00:49.040
 It's using reason in some ways better than any human beings have.

1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:54.160
 I mean, the founding fathers are giants historically, in my view, because they came up with these

1:00:54.160 --> 1:00:55.160
 truths.

1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:57.600
 I do think they're truths, but they're certainly not self evident.

1:00:57.600 --> 1:00:59.880
 I mean, if they were, your arm is right.

1:00:59.880 --> 1:01:03.200
 They would have discovered them thousands of years earlier or everybody would accept

1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:04.200
 them, right?

1:01:04.200 --> 1:01:09.040
 I mean, how many people today think that those, what they state in that document is true?

1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:11.080
 Pretty much, you know, five people.

1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:12.080
 I don't know.

1:01:12.080 --> 1:01:16.600
 It's very, it's very, your criticism of modern society, yes, we'll get there.

1:01:16.600 --> 1:01:21.380
 It's very, very few people recognize that if they were self evident, bam, everybody

1:01:21.380 --> 1:01:26.600
 would have become, you know, would have accepted the American Revolution as truth and that

1:01:26.600 --> 1:01:27.600
 was it.

1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:32.400
 A lot of work has to go into understanding and describing and convincing people about

1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:33.400
 those truths.

1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:39.720
 But I completely disagree with your arm about this idea or I'll voice my dissent, as we

1:01:39.720 --> 1:01:40.720
 said.

1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:42.800
 I disagree with your official dissent.

1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:47.560
 About A, that this being two different revolutions and B, that the American Revolution had any

1:01:47.560 --> 1:01:50.200
 similarity to the French Revolution.

1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:55.760
 You know that Jefferson and Payne, they were in France running a different revolution.

1:01:55.760 --> 1:01:58.280
 I know, but they were waiting constantly.

1:01:58.280 --> 1:02:01.800
 I mean, they were in communication with Madison, there was a lot of input going on.

1:02:01.800 --> 1:02:06.480
 I know, and Jefferson's sitting there in Paris pulling his hair out because Madison has come

1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:09.800
 under the influence of these nationalists and he can't believe it.

1:02:09.800 --> 1:02:15.080
 The reality is that the difference between the French Revolution and the American Revolution

1:02:15.080 --> 1:02:23.160
 is vast and it is a deep philosophical difference and it's a difference that expressed, I think,

1:02:23.160 --> 1:02:24.160
 between the differences.

1:02:24.160 --> 1:02:29.680
 You know, Joram, in his writings, lumps Rousseau with Locke and with Voltaire and with others

1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:32.280
 and I think that's wrong.

1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:34.280
 I think Rousseau is very different than the others.

1:02:34.280 --> 1:02:40.360
 I think, again, Rousseau is an anti enlightenment figure, Rousseau is in many respects hearkening

1:02:40.360 --> 1:02:47.680
 back to a past, an ancient past and I think a completely distorted view of human nature,

1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:48.680
 of human mind.

1:02:48.680 --> 1:02:49.680
 He rejects reason.

1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:55.400
 I mean, Rousseau is on the premise that reason is the end of humanity, reason is the destruction

1:02:55.400 --> 1:03:00.160
 of humanity, reason is how we get civilization and civilization is awful because –

1:03:00.160 --> 1:03:01.960
 I don't disagree.

1:03:01.960 --> 1:03:04.040
 We're only talking about different texts.

1:03:04.040 --> 1:03:06.760
 When I say Rousseau, I'm just talking about the social contract.

1:03:06.760 --> 1:03:11.000
 Yeah, but the social contract, there's similarity between others, but he takes it in a completely

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:16.720
 different direction and we agree social contract is a bad idea, but you can't have a contract

1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:21.600
 that you don't actually voluntarily accept, but Rousseau is the French Revolution.

1:03:21.600 --> 1:03:26.880
 Rousseau is about destruction and mayhem and chaos and anarchy.

1:03:26.880 --> 1:03:29.000
 He is the spirit behind the French Revolution.

1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.920
 I think the American Revolution is a complete rejection of Rousseau.

1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:34.400
 I think Jefferson is a complete rejection of Rousseau.

1:03:34.400 --> 1:03:36.040
 I don't think Jefferson is a fan of Rousseau.

1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:38.800
 He is of Voltaire and he certainly is of Montesquieu.

1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:43.160
 If you look at the Federalist Papers, the intellectual most cited in the Federalist

1:03:43.160 --> 1:03:48.000
 Papers I think in terms of just the number of times it's cited is Montesquieu.

1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:51.860
 So I think that the American Revolution is an individualistic revolution.

1:03:51.860 --> 1:03:55.400
 It is a revolution about the rights of the individual.

1:03:55.400 --> 1:03:58.280
 The French Revolution is a negation of the rights of the individual.

1:03:58.280 --> 1:04:00.440
 It's a collectivistic revolution.

1:04:00.440 --> 1:04:06.720
 It's not quite the Marxist revolution of the proletarian, but it's defining people in classes

1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:12.200
 and it's a rebellion against a certain class and yeah, kill them all, right?

1:04:12.200 --> 1:04:13.880
 Off with their heads.

1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:15.380
 It is a negation.

1:04:15.380 --> 1:04:19.760
 It's about egalitarianism in the sense of equality of outcome, not in a sense of equality

1:04:19.760 --> 1:04:23.720
 before the law or equality of rights, which is the Jeffersonian sense.

1:04:23.720 --> 1:04:33.280
 I think it's wrong to lump Jefferson in to the fraternity egalitarian notion of the French,

1:04:33.280 --> 1:04:42.200
 which is far more similar to what ultimately became socialism and Marxism and that tradition.

1:04:42.200 --> 1:04:46.360
 It's anti individualistic, the French Revolution is, whereas the American Revolution, the first

1:04:46.360 --> 1:04:48.700
 one, is individualistic.

1:04:48.700 --> 1:04:52.880
 It's all about individual rights and while there's certain phrases in the Declaration

1:04:52.880 --> 1:04:58.240
 of Independence that I don't agree with, it's beautifully written and it's a magnificent

1:04:58.240 --> 1:05:02.280
 document, so it's hard for me to say I don't agree, but who am I?

1:05:02.280 --> 1:05:06.520
 These were giants, self evident is one of them.

1:05:06.520 --> 1:05:13.180
 I'm not particularly crazy about Endowed by the Creator, but I like the fact that it's

1:05:13.180 --> 1:05:18.080
 creator and not God or not a specific creator, but just a more general thing.

1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:22.280
 But putting those two ashes aside, it's the greatest political document in all of human

1:05:22.280 --> 1:05:24.160
 history in my view by far.

1:05:24.160 --> 1:05:25.400
 Nothing comes close.

1:05:25.400 --> 1:05:34.120
 It is a document that identifies the core principles of political truism, of truth.

1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:38.560
 That is, the role of government is to preserve and to protect these rights, these inalienable

1:05:38.560 --> 1:05:42.260
 rights and that is so crucial that these rights are inalienable.

1:05:42.260 --> 1:05:48.100
 That is, a majority can't vote them out, a revelation can't vote them out.

1:05:48.100 --> 1:05:55.080
 This is what is required for human liberty and human freedom, the right that is the sanction,

1:05:55.080 --> 1:05:59.280
 the freedom to act on your own behalf, to act based on your own judgment and as long

1:05:59.280 --> 1:06:04.480
 as you're not interfering with other people's rights, you are free to do so.

1:06:04.480 --> 1:06:10.080
 That is such a profound truth and that to me is the essence of political philosophy.

1:06:10.080 --> 1:06:17.280
 That's the beginning and it's based on, just not to fall into, Yolam's going to say it's

1:06:17.280 --> 1:06:21.320
 a rationalist, it's based on a whole history of what happens when we negate that.

1:06:21.320 --> 1:06:27.160
 It's based on looking at England and seeing to the extent that they practiced a respect

1:06:27.160 --> 1:06:32.560
 for individual liberty, of property, of freedom, good things happened.

1:06:32.560 --> 1:06:34.480
 So let's take that all the way.

1:06:34.480 --> 1:06:36.140
 Let's not compromise on that.

1:06:36.140 --> 1:06:42.720
 Let's be consistent with the good and reject the bad and when England goes away, distance

1:06:42.720 --> 1:06:47.840
 itself from the rights of man, from the idea of a right to property and so on, bad things

1:06:47.840 --> 1:06:54.120
 happen and when they go to it, let's go all in and I'm all in on the right to life, liberty,

1:06:54.120 --> 1:06:55.640
 property and the pursuit of happiness.

1:06:55.640 --> 1:06:59.920
 And I think the idea of pursuit of happiness is profound because it's a moral statement.

1:06:59.920 --> 1:07:06.080
 It's a statement that says that sanctions and says that ultimately people should be

1:07:06.080 --> 1:07:12.840
 allowed to make their own judgments and live their lives as they see fit based on how they

1:07:12.840 --> 1:07:13.840
 view happiness.

1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:16.840
 They might be right, they might be wrong, but we're not going to dictate what happiness

1:07:16.840 --> 1:07:20.760
 entails and dictate to people how they should live their lives.

1:07:20.760 --> 1:07:23.800
 We're going to let them figure that out.

1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:29.440
 So it has this self interested moral code kind of embedded in it.

1:07:29.440 --> 1:07:31.240
 So I think it's a beautiful statement.

1:07:31.240 --> 1:07:35.280
 So I think the declaration is key and I think there was an experiment.

1:07:35.280 --> 1:07:41.720
 An experiment was proposed in that period before the Constitution where the experiment

1:07:41.720 --> 1:07:47.600
 was let's let the states, let's have a kind of a loose confederation, let's let the states

1:07:47.600 --> 1:07:52.760
 experiment with setting up their own constitutions and rule of government and we won't have any

1:07:52.760 --> 1:07:54.020
 kind of unity.

1:07:54.020 --> 1:07:58.040
 And I think what they realized, and I think even Jefferson realized, is that that was

1:07:58.040 --> 1:08:05.160
 not workable because many of the states were starting to significantly violate rights.

1:08:05.160 --> 1:08:11.640
 There was nothing to unify, there was nothing to really protect the vision of the declaration.

1:08:11.640 --> 1:08:16.000
 You needed to establish a nation, which is what the Constitution does, it establishes

1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:17.180
 a nation.

1:08:17.180 --> 1:08:25.880
 But the purpose of that was to put everybody under one set of laws that protected rights.

1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:33.280
 The focus was still on the protection of rights and I agree with six of the seven of the principles.

1:08:33.280 --> 1:08:34.360
 Which did this group?

1:08:34.360 --> 1:08:37.560
 The common welfare, the general welfare, which I'm worried about, right?

1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:42.120
 I think in the way the founders understood it, I think I probably agreed with it.

1:08:42.120 --> 1:08:43.120
 But it's such an ambiguous—

1:08:43.120 --> 1:08:44.640
 I'm sure you don't agree.

1:08:44.640 --> 1:08:45.640
 Maybe I don't.

1:08:45.640 --> 1:08:48.440
 Can you state the general welfare principle?

1:08:48.440 --> 1:08:53.880
 Well the idea that part of the role of government is to secure the general welfare is something—

1:08:53.880 --> 1:08:58.080
 This is something we didn't get to in the debate, we really should have, is the question

1:08:58.080 --> 1:09:04.920
 of whether there is such a thing as a common good or a public interest or a national interest

1:09:04.920 --> 1:09:11.280
 or a general welfare, do these words, do these terms mean anything other than the good of

1:09:11.280 --> 1:09:13.320
 all of the individuals in the country?

1:09:13.320 --> 1:09:14.320
 That's an important—

1:09:14.320 --> 1:09:19.280
 Yeah, so that's right, so that's why I object to it because I think it's too easy

1:09:19.280 --> 1:09:20.760
 to interpret it as.

1:09:20.760 --> 1:09:27.200
 So I interpret it as, well, what's good for a general, a group, a common people, it's

1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:29.800
 a good collection of individuals, so what's good for the individual is good for the common

1:09:29.800 --> 1:09:35.920
 welfare, but I understand that that's something that is hard for people to grasp and not the

1:09:35.920 --> 1:09:37.320
 common understanding.

1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:42.440
 So I would have skipped the general welfare in order to avoid the fact that now the general

1:09:42.440 --> 1:09:48.680
 welfare includes the government telling you what gender you should be assigned, so I would

1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:51.160
 have wanted to have skipped that completely.

1:09:51.160 --> 1:09:54.840
 So I think the Constitution is completely consistent with the Declaration with a few

1:09:54.840 --> 1:10:01.120
 exceptions of general welfare, but perfection is a difficult thing to find, particularly

1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:05.560
 for me politically, but it's a magnificent document, the Constitution.

1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:08.720
 It doesn't quite rise to the level, I think, of the Declaration, but it's a magnificent

1:10:08.720 --> 1:10:13.960
 document because—and this is the difference, I think, between the English Constitution.

1:10:13.960 --> 1:10:17.320
 Here's what I see as the difference.

1:10:17.320 --> 1:10:22.480
 The difference is that the Constitution is written in the context of why do we have a

1:10:22.480 --> 1:10:24.580
 separation of powers, for example?

1:10:24.580 --> 1:10:27.960
 We have a separation of powers in order to make sure that the government only does what

1:10:27.960 --> 1:10:30.720
 the government is supposed to do, and what is the government supposed to do?

1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:33.080
 Well, fundamentally, it's supposed to protect rights.

1:10:33.080 --> 1:10:37.960
 I mean, all of those seven, or at least six of the seven, are about protecting rights.

1:10:37.960 --> 1:10:39.680
 They're about protecting us from foreign invaders.

1:10:39.680 --> 1:10:43.240
 They're about protecting peace within the country.

1:10:43.240 --> 1:10:48.080
 They're about preserving this protection of rights, and why do we have this separation

1:10:48.080 --> 1:10:53.240
 so that we make sure that no one of those entities, the executive or the legislature,

1:10:53.240 --> 1:10:56.520
 the judicial, can violate rights because there's always somebody looking over their shoulder.

1:10:56.520 --> 1:11:00.600
 There's always somebody who can veto their power, but there's a purpose to it, and that

1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:05.440
 purpose is clearly signified and characterized, and that's why I think the Bill of Rights

1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:09.960
 was written, in order to add to the clarification of what exactly we mean.

1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:10.960
 What is the purpose?

1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:16.040
 The purpose is to preserve rights, and that's why we need to elaborate what those rights

1:11:16.040 --> 1:11:17.040
 are.

1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:20.920
 And Madison's objection to the Bill of Rights was to say not that he objected to having

1:11:20.920 --> 1:11:26.920
 protection of rights, but to listing them because he was worried that other rights that

1:11:26.920 --> 1:11:30.560
 were not listed would not be, and his worry was completely justified because it's exactly

1:11:30.560 --> 1:11:31.560
 what's happened.

1:11:31.560 --> 1:11:34.840
 It's like, the only reason we have free speech in America is because we've got it in writing

1:11:34.840 --> 1:11:35.840
 as a First Amendment.

1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:39.480
 If we didn't have it in writing, it would have been gone a long time ago, and the reason

1:11:39.480 --> 1:11:46.320
 we don't have, for example, the freedom to negotiate a contract, you know, independent

1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:51.320
 government regulation, that was not listed as a right in the Bill, even though I think

1:11:51.320 --> 1:11:54.720
 it's clearly covered under the Constitution and certainly under the Declaration.

1:11:54.720 --> 1:11:57.080
 So there was a massive mistake done in the Bill of Rights.

1:11:57.080 --> 1:12:03.720
 They tried to cover it with the Ninth Amendment, but it never really stuck, this idea that

1:12:03.720 --> 1:12:06.960
 nonenumerated rights that are still in place.

1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:08.640
 So I don't see it as a second revolution.

1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:13.600
 I think it's a fix to a flaw that happened.

1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:22.000
 It's a fix that allowed the expansion of the protection of rights to all states by creating

1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:28.200
 a national entity to protect those rights, and that's what ultimately led to slavery

1:12:28.200 --> 1:12:29.880
 going away.

1:12:29.880 --> 1:12:36.120
 You know, under the initial agreement, slavery would have been there in perpetuity because

1:12:36.120 --> 1:12:40.960
 states were sovereign in a way that under the new Constitution they were not, and in

1:12:40.960 --> 1:12:44.920
 a sense, the Constitution sets in motion, the Declaration and then the Constitution

1:12:44.920 --> 1:12:47.400
 set in motion, the Civil War.

1:12:47.400 --> 1:12:51.520
 The Civil War has to happen because at the end of the day, you cannot have some states

1:12:51.520 --> 1:12:55.760
 with a massive violation of rights, what's more of a violation of rights than slavery,

1:12:55.760 --> 1:13:01.040
 and some states that recognize it's not, it inevitably leads to the Civil War.

1:13:01.040 --> 1:13:05.240
 Yaron was just saying that, you know, other than the general welfare, these principles

1:13:05.240 --> 1:13:07.440
 are about individual liberties.

1:13:07.440 --> 1:13:09.560
 I just don't think you can read it that way.

1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:15.240
 The first stated purpose of the Constitution of 1787 is in order to form a more perfect

1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:16.240
 union.

1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:22.840
 A more perfect union, it's describing a characteristic of the whole, it is not a characteristic of

1:13:22.840 --> 1:13:24.520
 any individual.

1:13:24.520 --> 1:13:28.960
 If you look at how the individuals are doing, you don't know whether their union is more

1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:30.200
 or less perfect.

1:13:30.200 --> 1:13:35.740
 So what they're doing is they're looking at the condition in which in order to be able

1:13:35.740 --> 1:13:40.200
 to fight the battle of Yorktown, somebody has to write a personal check in order to

1:13:40.200 --> 1:13:41.480
 be able to move armies.

1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:47.320
 A more perfect union is a more cohesive union, it's the ability to get all of these different

1:13:47.320 --> 1:13:52.720
 individuals to do one focused thing when it's necessary to do it.

1:13:52.720 --> 1:13:57.880
 Well it's more than that, right, so I agree with that, but for what purpose?

1:13:57.880 --> 1:14:02.560
 That is, and this is why, you know, this is why it's so hard with these historical documents

1:14:02.560 --> 1:14:07.240
 because there's a context and there's a thinking that they can't write everything down, right,

1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:09.360
 which is sad because I wish they had.

1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:11.380
 What's the purpose of a more perfect union?

1:14:11.380 --> 1:14:15.840
 The purpose of the more perfect union is to preserve the liberty of the individuals within

1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:16.840
 that union.

1:14:16.840 --> 1:14:18.320
 Well how do you know?

1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:20.020
 Because if you look, what's the rest?

1:14:20.020 --> 1:14:21.240
 So what is the common defense?

1:14:21.240 --> 1:14:26.680
 The common defense is to protect us from foreign invaders who would now disrupt what the rest

1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:28.160
 of the Constitution is all about.

1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:33.880
 All of the Constitution is written in a way as to preserve, find ways to limit the ability

1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:38.160
 of government to violate the rights of individuals.

1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:43.200
 The beauty of this Constitution, and again, it's connection to the Declaration and tradition,

1:14:43.200 --> 1:14:44.200
 right?

1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:45.200
 What came before it?

1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:49.280
 What came before it was a document, which they all respected, which was the Declaration,

1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:50.800
 which set the context for this.

1:14:50.800 --> 1:14:55.760
 And now the union is there in order to provide for the common defense, great, because we

1:14:55.760 --> 1:14:59.880
 know that foreign invaders can violate our rights, that's what war is about.

1:14:59.880 --> 1:15:04.340
 To protect us from peace, to establish peace and justice within the country, that's based

1:15:04.340 --> 1:15:09.500
 on law, the rule of law, and again, individual liberty.

1:15:09.500 --> 1:15:13.900
 So to me, when you read the Founders, when you read the Federalist Papers, when you read

1:15:13.900 --> 1:15:19.200
 what they wrote, what they're trying to do is figure out the right kind of political

1:15:19.200 --> 1:15:25.680
 system, the right kind of structure to be able to preserve these liberties, and not

1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:30.640
 all of them had, from my perspective, a perfect understanding of what those liberties entailed,

1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:35.240
 but they were all, even the conservatives that you call conservatives, were all in generally

1:15:35.240 --> 1:15:39.400
 in agreement about the importance of individual liberty and the importance of individual liberty.

1:15:39.400 --> 1:15:44.420
 Of course, because almost all of these rights are traditional English rights, they exist

1:15:44.420 --> 1:15:49.000
 in the English Bill of Rights, in the English Petition of Rights, they exist in force.

1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:50.000
 All of these are traditional.

1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:51.000
 And what they're trying to do is perfect that.

1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:54.040
 They're trying to take the British system and perfect it.

1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:59.480
 But you keep leaving out that they want to be like England in that they want to have

1:15:59.480 --> 1:16:01.160
 an independent nation.

1:16:01.160 --> 1:16:04.640
 An independent nation is not a collection of individual liberties.

1:16:04.640 --> 1:16:09.000
 An independent nation, the first sentence of the Declaration of Independence is the

1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:13.120
 declaration that there is a collective right, that we as a people are breaking the bonds

1:16:13.120 --> 1:16:17.820
 with another people, and we're going to take our place, our equal station, among the nations

1:16:17.820 --> 1:16:18.820
 of the earth.

1:16:18.820 --> 1:16:20.240
 But for what purpose?

1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:22.200
 The purpose is to protect individual rights.

1:16:22.200 --> 1:16:24.080
 And there's no collective right.

1:16:24.080 --> 1:16:25.840
 Your argument is completely circular.

1:16:25.840 --> 1:16:32.800
 You're not allowing the possibility that there could be great and decent men that you and

1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:39.760
 I both admire who wanted the independence of their nation, not because that would give

1:16:39.760 --> 1:16:45.200
 individuals liberty, but because the independence of their nation was itself a great good.

1:16:45.200 --> 1:16:48.920
 So we clearly disagree on this, because I don't think the independence of the nation

1:16:48.920 --> 1:16:50.920
 is a good in and of itself, because it's –

1:16:50.920 --> 1:16:52.720
 But did they think it was?

1:16:52.720 --> 1:16:54.200
 I don't think they did.

1:16:54.200 --> 1:17:02.080
 And this is why they tried so hard not to break from England, and why many of them struggled,

1:17:02.080 --> 1:17:07.240
 really, really struggled with having a revolution, because England was pretty good, right?

1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:08.240
 England was the best.

1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:12.600
 And this is where we should get to the universality of these things, because I do think England

1:17:12.600 --> 1:17:18.080
 was the best, and universally and absolutely was the best system out there.

1:17:18.080 --> 1:17:23.280
 And they struggled to break from England, because they didn't view the value of having

1:17:23.280 --> 1:17:25.040
 a nation as the primary.

1:17:25.040 --> 1:17:30.300
 But what they identified in England is certain flaws in the system that created situations

1:17:30.300 --> 1:17:32.540
 in which their rights were being violated.

1:17:32.540 --> 1:17:38.100
 So they figured the only option in order to secure these rights is to break away from

1:17:38.100 --> 1:17:39.320
 England and secure a nation.

1:17:39.320 --> 1:17:44.360
 Now, I am not an anarchist, as Michael Malice is, because we've discussed it.

1:17:44.360 --> 1:17:46.440
 I believe you need nations.

1:17:46.440 --> 1:17:48.980
 You need nations to secure those rights.

1:17:48.980 --> 1:17:53.080
 That is, the rights are not – you can't secure those rights without having a nation.

1:17:53.080 --> 1:17:55.160
 But the nation is just a means to an end.

1:17:55.160 --> 1:17:58.920
 The end is the rights, and I think that's how the founders understood it, and that's

1:17:58.920 --> 1:18:01.560
 why they created this kind of country.

1:18:01.560 --> 1:18:07.400
 I think this is a good place to ask about common welfare and cohesion.

1:18:07.400 --> 1:18:14.600
 Let me say what John Donne wrote that, quote, no man is an island entire of itself.

1:18:14.600 --> 1:18:18.600
 Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.

1:18:18.600 --> 1:18:25.720
 He went on, any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore

1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:29.080
 never sent to know for whom the bell tolls.

1:18:29.080 --> 1:18:32.120
 It tolls for thee.

1:18:32.120 --> 1:18:40.040
 So let's talk about individualism and cohesion, not just at the political level, but at a

1:18:40.040 --> 1:18:43.600
 philosophical level for the human condition.

1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:45.140
 What is central?

1:18:45.140 --> 1:18:49.760
 What is the role of other humans in our lives?

1:18:49.760 --> 1:18:51.160
 What's the importance of cohesion?

1:18:51.160 --> 1:18:53.080
 This is something you've talked about.

1:18:53.080 --> 1:19:00.040
 So Aaron said that the beauty of the founding documents is that they create a cohesive union

1:19:00.040 --> 1:19:07.600
 that protects the individual freedoms, but you have spoken about the value of the union,

1:19:07.600 --> 1:19:13.240
 the common welfare, the cohesion in itself.

1:19:13.240 --> 1:19:19.880
 So can you maybe elaborate on what is the role of cohesion and the collective, not to

1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:25.040
 use that term, but multiple humans together connected in the human condition?

1:19:25.040 --> 1:19:30.600
 Sure, I keep getting the feeling that Yaron and I are actually having a disagreement about

1:19:30.600 --> 1:19:37.280
 empirical reality, because I think that enlightenment rationalist political thought features the

1:19:37.280 --> 1:19:40.920
 individual, it features the state.

1:19:40.920 --> 1:19:46.760
 There isn't really a nation other than the nation, the people as a collective is created

1:19:46.760 --> 1:19:51.520
 by the state, and when the state disappears, then the collective disappears.

1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:58.840
 Now, I think that when conservatives of all stripes look at this kind of thinking, that

1:19:58.840 --> 1:20:04.000
 there's the individuals and then there's the state, and there really isn't anything else.

1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:10.020
 When they look at that, they say, even before you get to consequences, it's a terrible theory

1:20:10.020 --> 1:20:16.120
 because when we try to understand any field of inquiry, any domain, any subject area,

1:20:16.120 --> 1:20:25.240
 when you try to understand it, we try to come up with a small number of concepts and of

1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:33.000
 relations among the concepts, which is supposed to be able to explain, to illuminate as much

1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:37.360
 as possible the important things that are taking place in the domain.

1:20:37.360 --> 1:20:42.040
 And conservatives look at this, individuals and the state, and they say, you're missing

1:20:42.040 --> 1:20:50.160
 most of what's going on in politics, also in personal human relations as well.

1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:54.400
 But it just doesn't look like a description of human beings, it looks like a completely

1:20:54.400 --> 1:20:55.720
 artificial thing.

1:20:55.720 --> 1:20:59.160
 And then conservatives say, well, look, once you adopt this artificial thing, then the

1:20:59.160 --> 1:21:02.780
 consequences are horrific because you're not describing reality.

1:21:02.780 --> 1:21:12.000
 So a conservative reality begins with an empirical view of what are human beings like, and the

1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:16.280
 first thing you notice about human beings, or at least the first thing I think conservatives

1:21:16.280 --> 1:21:20.800
 notice is that they're sticky, is that they clump, they turn into groups.

1:21:20.800 --> 1:21:27.200
 And you take any arbitrary collection of human beings and set them to a task, or even just

1:21:27.200 --> 1:21:33.580
 leave them alone, and they quickly form into groups and those groups are always structured

1:21:33.580 --> 1:21:34.580
 as hierarchies.

1:21:34.580 --> 1:21:38.080
 This is this competition within the hierarchy, who's going to be the leader, who's going

1:21:38.080 --> 1:21:39.400
 to be number two.

1:21:39.400 --> 1:21:46.880
 But everywhere you look in human societies, universally, there are groups, the groups

1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:51.080
 compete and they're structured internally as hierarchies, and then there are internal

1:21:51.080 --> 1:21:55.040
 competitions for who leads the different groups.

1:21:55.040 --> 1:22:00.360
 And when we think about scientific explanation, we allow that there are different levels of

1:22:00.360 --> 1:22:07.560
 explanation that a macroscopic object like a table, it doesn't have properties that can

1:22:07.560 --> 1:22:13.040
 be directly derived from the properties of the atoms or the molecules or the microfibers

1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:15.480
 that make up the table.

1:22:15.480 --> 1:22:21.040
 And that's understood, that there's what academic philosophers call emergent properties,

1:22:21.040 --> 1:22:25.320
 that when you get up to the level of the table, it has properties like that you can't put

1:22:25.320 --> 1:22:31.040
 your fist through it, which you can't necessarily know just by looking at the atoms alone.

1:22:31.040 --> 1:22:36.140
 And I think conservatives say the same thing is true for political theory, for social theory,

1:22:36.140 --> 1:22:41.080
 that looking at an individual human being and thinking about what does that individual

1:22:41.080 --> 1:22:46.280
 human being need, which Jeroen does very eloquently in his writings.

1:22:46.280 --> 1:22:53.320
 But that doesn't tell you what the characteristics are of this hierarchically structured group.

1:22:53.320 --> 1:22:56.680
 As soon as you have that, it has its own qualities.

1:22:56.680 --> 1:23:01.600
 So an example, the question of what holds these groups together, and we need to answer

1:23:01.600 --> 1:23:03.400
 that question.

1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:07.360
 I try to answer it by saying there's such a thing as mutual loyalty.

1:23:07.360 --> 1:23:14.160
 Mutual loyalty is shorthand for human beings, individuals have the capacity to include another

1:23:14.160 --> 1:23:19.240
 individual within their self, within their conception of their self.

1:23:19.240 --> 1:23:27.680
 When two people do it, it creates a bond, like a bond between two atoms creates a molecule.

1:23:27.680 --> 1:23:30.660
 That doesn't mean that they lose their individuality.

1:23:30.660 --> 1:23:33.640
 Within the group, they may still continue competing with one another.

1:23:33.640 --> 1:23:39.960
 But that doesn't mean that there isn't, in reality, a bond, and that real bond is the

1:23:39.960 --> 1:23:46.420
 stuff of which political events and political history are made, is the coming together,

1:23:46.420 --> 1:23:51.280
 the cohesion and the dissolution of these bonded loyalty groups.

1:23:51.280 --> 1:23:54.600
 That's the reality of politics.

1:23:54.600 --> 1:24:00.680
 And so when I hear these discussions about individuals in the state, I feel like we're

1:24:00.680 --> 1:24:05.840
 missing most of the reality, and in order to understand the political reality, we need

1:24:05.840 --> 1:24:12.000
 to understand what makes human beings coherent to groups, what makes them dissolve, what

1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:16.400
 makes the groups come apart and end up creating civil wars and that kind of thing.

1:24:16.400 --> 1:24:25.680
 I think we also need to know, in practice, rival groups do come together and bond.

1:24:25.680 --> 1:24:33.560
 I mean, basically, when we think about democratic society, we're talking about different groups,

1:24:33.560 --> 1:24:37.800
 we can call them tribes, or you can come up with a different name, but different tribal

1:24:37.800 --> 1:24:43.560
 groupings with different views, they come together to form a nation, and they're able

1:24:43.560 --> 1:24:48.800
 to do that, even though often they hate each other, like we were talking about the American

1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:53.400
 Revolution, and often they hate each other, and nevertheless, they're able to come together.

1:24:53.400 --> 1:24:54.400
 Why?

1:24:54.400 --> 1:24:55.400
 How?

1:24:55.400 --> 1:25:00.840
 And that leads us into questions like, how does honor, the giving of honor by one group

1:25:00.840 --> 1:25:08.800
 to another, how does that increase the mutual loyalty between groups that are still competing

1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:10.280
 with one another?

1:25:10.280 --> 1:25:15.040
 All of these questions, I think we have to answer them in order to be able to talk about

1:25:15.040 --> 1:25:17.920
 politics.

1:25:17.920 --> 1:25:23.720
 And I think the reason, the first reason why one should approach politics as a conservative

1:25:23.720 --> 1:25:29.000
 rather than as an individualist is because it gives us these theoretical tools to be

1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:33.720
 able to talk about reality, which we don't have as long as we keep within the individualist

1:25:33.720 --> 1:25:34.720
 framework.

1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:40.120
 As we're talking, the metaphor that's popping up into my mind, and this is also something

1:25:40.120 --> 1:25:46.440
 that bothers me with theoretical physics, the metaphor is there's some sense in which

1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:51.640
 this thing's called theories of everything, where you try to describe the basic laws of

1:25:51.640 --> 1:25:55.960
 physics, how they interact together, and once you do, you have a sense that you understand

1:25:55.960 --> 1:25:57.960
 all of reality.

1:25:57.960 --> 1:25:59.240
 In a sense, you do.

1:25:59.240 --> 1:26:05.240
 And that to me, that to me is understanding the individual, like how the individual behaves

1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:06.240
 in this world.

1:26:06.240 --> 1:26:12.400
 But then you're saying that they're, hey, hey, you're also forgetting chemistry, biology,

1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:17.880
 how all of that actually comes together, the stickiness, the stickiness of molecules and

1:26:17.880 --> 1:26:22.080
 how they build different systems and they, some systems can kill each other, some systems

1:26:22.080 --> 1:26:28.620
 can flourish, some can make pancakes and bananas and some can make poison and all those kinds

1:26:28.620 --> 1:26:36.600
 of things that we need to be able to, we need to consider the full stack of things that

1:26:36.600 --> 1:26:40.760
 are constructed from the fundamental basics.

1:26:40.760 --> 1:26:47.480
 And I guess, Yaron, you're saying that, no, you're just like the theoretical physicist,

1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:54.000
 it all starts at the bottom, like if you need to preserve the fundamentals of reality, which

1:26:54.000 --> 1:27:01.320
 is the individual, like the basic atom of human society is the individual, do you?

1:27:01.320 --> 1:27:07.280
 So yes, so the basic unit, the basic moral unit, the basic ethical unit in society is

1:27:07.280 --> 1:27:08.280
 the individual.

1:27:08.280 --> 1:27:13.160
 And yeah, of course we form groups and you can't understand history unless you understand

1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:18.420
 group formation and group motivation and I have a view about what kind of groups should

1:27:18.420 --> 1:27:25.400
 be formed and politically, from a political perspective, voluntary ones, ones in which

1:27:25.400 --> 1:27:32.460
 we join when we want to join and we can leave when we want to leave and ones that help us

1:27:32.460 --> 1:27:38.740
 and clearly groups help us pursue whatever it is a goal is ultimately.

1:27:38.740 --> 1:27:43.600
 So in the pursuit of happiness, there are lots of groups that one wants to form, whether

1:27:43.600 --> 1:27:49.460
 it's marriage, whether it's businesses, whether it's sports teams, there are lots of different

1:27:49.460 --> 1:27:54.180
 groups one wants to form, but the question is what is the standard of well being?

1:27:54.180 --> 1:28:01.060
 Is it the standard of well being some algorithm that maximizes the well being of a group,

1:28:01.060 --> 1:28:03.560
 some utilitarian function?

1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:11.320
 Is it something that's inherent in the group that we can measure as goodness and to help

1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:16.200
 with individuals within as long as we can get the group to function well, we don't really

1:28:16.200 --> 1:28:17.960
 care about where the individuals are.

1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:23.680
 So to me, the goal of creating groups is the well being of the individual and that's why

1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:27.680
 it needs to be voluntary and that's why there has to be a way out of those.

1:28:27.680 --> 1:28:31.200
 Sometimes it's costly, it's not a cheap out, that's why you should really think about what

1:28:31.200 --> 1:28:36.720
 groups you and this on an issue that's very controversial, maybe we can discuss, maybe

1:28:36.720 --> 1:28:37.720
 not.

1:28:37.720 --> 1:28:42.860
 To me, immigration is so important, open immigration or free immigration is because that's another

1:28:42.860 --> 1:28:48.000
 group that I would like people to be able to voluntarily choose both in and out and

1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:54.120
 I'd like to see people be able to go and join that group that they believe will allow for

1:28:54.120 --> 1:28:55.120
 the pursuit of happiness.

1:28:55.120 --> 1:29:00.200
 But let me say that that's a description of an ideal, what I'm just saying.

1:29:00.200 --> 1:29:03.400
 I recognize that that's not the reality in which we live.

1:29:03.400 --> 1:29:06.800
 I recognize that that's not the reality in which history.

1:29:06.800 --> 1:29:15.560
 Recognizing that the individual exists in a sense, philosophically, is a massive achievement.

1:29:15.560 --> 1:29:21.360
 Human beings, however they evolved, clearly we started out in a tribal context in which

1:29:21.360 --> 1:29:23.000
 the individual didn't matter.

1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:28.600
 We followed the leader, the competition was for power, power over the group and dictates

1:29:28.600 --> 1:29:32.280
 how the group should work.

1:29:32.280 --> 1:29:36.880
 The history of human beings is a history of gaining knowledge and part of the knowledge

1:29:36.880 --> 1:29:39.640
 is the value of an individual.

1:29:39.640 --> 1:29:44.400
 You can see that in religion, you can see that in philosophy, you can see that through

1:29:44.400 --> 1:29:47.680
 the evolution.

1:29:47.680 --> 1:29:52.420
 We evolved from tribes into nations and then empires and conflicts between nations and

1:29:52.420 --> 1:29:54.200
 conflicts between empires.

1:29:54.200 --> 1:29:56.080
 We tried a lot of different things, if you will.

1:29:56.080 --> 1:30:01.040
 I don't think we always did it on purpose, but different philosophies, different sets

1:30:01.040 --> 1:30:07.200
 of ideas drove us towards different collectives, different groupings, and different ways in

1:30:07.200 --> 1:30:09.600
 which to structure.

1:30:09.600 --> 1:30:14.840
 After 3,000 years of known history, there's history before that, but we don't know much

1:30:14.840 --> 1:30:19.520
 about it, 3,000 years of known history, you can sit back and evaluate.

1:30:19.520 --> 1:30:23.080
 I think that's what is done in the Enlightenment.

1:30:23.080 --> 1:30:27.140
 You sit back, and certainly we can do it today, we can sit back and evaluate.

1:30:27.140 --> 1:30:29.620
 What promotes human flourishing and what doesn't?

1:30:29.620 --> 1:30:32.240
 What do we mean by human flourishing?

1:30:32.240 --> 1:30:33.240
 Who's flourishing?

1:30:33.240 --> 1:30:35.040
 Well, individual human beings.

1:30:35.040 --> 1:30:39.440
 Now, since I don't believe in a zero sum world, and the world is not zero sum, we can see

1:30:39.440 --> 1:30:44.440
 that, it's empirically possible to show that the world is not a zero sum game, my flourishing

1:30:44.440 --> 1:30:49.400
 doesn't come at your expense, so I can show that a system that promotes my flourishing

1:30:49.400 --> 1:30:53.280
 probably promotes your flourishing as well and promotes the general welfare in that sense

1:30:53.280 --> 1:31:01.520
 because it promotes individuals flourishing, and we can look at all these examples of how

1:31:01.520 --> 1:31:06.480
 we evolved and what leads to bloodshed and what doesn't and what promotes this ability

1:31:06.480 --> 1:31:11.920
 to flourish as an individual, again, an achievement, the idea of individual flourishing, and then

1:31:11.920 --> 1:31:17.300
 we can think about how to create a political system around that, a political system that

1:31:17.300 --> 1:31:24.180
 recognizes and allows for the formation of groups, but just under the principle of voluntary.

1:31:24.180 --> 1:31:29.580
 You can't be forced to join a group, you can't be coerced into forming a group other than

1:31:29.580 --> 1:31:33.040
 the fact that you're born in a particular place, in a particular, you know, that in

1:31:33.040 --> 1:31:37.560
 a sense, but that's not forced, there's a difference between metaphysics and between

1:31:37.560 --> 1:31:38.560
 choices.

1:31:38.560 --> 1:31:42.520
 So this is something that came up in the debate that Yoram said that not all human relations

1:31:42.520 --> 1:31:48.400
 are voluntary, and you kind of emphasized that a lot of where we are is not voluntary.

1:31:48.400 --> 1:31:51.880
 We're grounded, we're connected in so much.

1:31:51.880 --> 1:32:00.000
 So how can a human be free in the way you're describing, individual be free if some part

1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:04.440
 of who we are is not voluntary, some part of who we are is other people?

1:32:04.440 --> 1:32:06.760
 Well because what do we mean by freedom?

1:32:06.760 --> 1:32:10.940
 Freedom doesn't mean the negation of the laws of physics, right?

1:32:10.940 --> 1:32:18.540
 Freedom doesn't mean ignoring, freedom means the ability within the scope of what's available

1:32:18.540 --> 1:32:22.240
 for you to choose, being able to choose those things.

1:32:22.240 --> 1:32:30.800
 So in a political context, freedom means, you know, the absence of coercion.

1:32:30.800 --> 1:32:35.880
 So once you're an adult, you know, Yoram says you're born into a particular religious

1:32:35.880 --> 1:32:39.400
 context, absolutely, but once you're an adult, I think it's incumbent on you to evaluate

1:32:39.400 --> 1:32:45.640
 that religious context and look at different religions or nonreligion or whatever and choose

1:32:45.640 --> 1:32:50.520
 your philosophy of life, choose your values, choose how you want to live your life.

1:32:50.520 --> 1:32:51.520
 That's the freedom.

1:32:51.520 --> 1:32:58.560
 The freedom is, one system says you're either coerced by the state or coerced by the group

1:32:58.560 --> 1:33:06.200
 or coerced by society around you to follow a particular path, or the expectation is,

1:33:06.200 --> 1:33:12.560
 the demand is, the pressure is to conform to a particular path, and my view is, no,

1:33:12.560 --> 1:33:16.960
 you should be in a position to be able to choose your path, and that choice means you

1:33:16.960 --> 1:33:23.480
 look around, you evaluate, you evaluate based on history, based on knowledge, based on all

1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:26.040
 of these things, and you choose what that path would be.

1:33:26.040 --> 1:33:28.800
 That's fundamentally what freedom means.

1:33:28.800 --> 1:33:31.840
 Yes, you cannot choose your parents, but of course not.

1:33:31.840 --> 1:33:34.760
 Nobody would claim that that's within the scope of what is possible.

1:33:34.760 --> 1:33:43.600
 I think the coercion freedom dichotomy, these are too few concepts, coercion and freedom.

1:33:43.600 --> 1:33:47.700
 It's too simplistic to be able to describe what we're actually dealing with.

1:33:47.700 --> 1:33:56.720
 The traditional Anglo conservative view is that society has to be, it has to be ordered,

1:33:56.720 --> 1:34:03.600
 it has to be disciplined, and there are two choices for how it can be ordered.

1:34:03.600 --> 1:34:11.280
 One is that a people is, by its own traditions, you would say voluntarily, but these are mostly

1:34:11.280 --> 1:34:16.640
 inherited traditions, by its own traditions, it is ordered.

1:34:16.640 --> 1:34:23.440
 For example, people just in general will not go into somebody else's yard, because that's

1:34:23.440 --> 1:34:27.600
 the custom here, is we don't go into somebody else's yard without their permission.

1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:34.240
 Fortescue, we're talking about 500 years ago already, Fortescue says that the genius of

1:34:34.240 --> 1:34:40.680
 the English people is that our government can be mild and apply very little coercion,

1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:43.240
 because the people are so disciplined.

1:34:43.240 --> 1:34:51.140
 When he says the people are so disciplined, what he's saying is that our nation, our tribes,

1:34:51.140 --> 1:35:00.080
 we have strong traditions which channel people through tools of being honored and dishonored.

1:35:00.080 --> 1:35:05.280
 That's a reality that exists in every society, and it's not captured by your distinction

1:35:05.280 --> 1:35:08.840
 between coercion and lack of coercion.

1:35:08.840 --> 1:35:16.520
 When I'm going to be dishonored if I don't care for my aging mother, I'm not being coerced

1:35:16.520 --> 1:35:22.960
 like the state comes and puts a gun to my head, but I am being pressured and given guidelines.

1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:31.320
 I'm saying that's wrong, and I'm saying that's dangerous, because that could easily be used

1:35:31.320 --> 1:35:32.320
 for bad traditions.

1:35:32.320 --> 1:35:34.320
 No, of course it is.

1:35:34.320 --> 1:35:37.280
 What's the standard by which we evaluate what a good tradition is and what a bad tradition

1:35:37.280 --> 1:35:38.280
 is?

1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:39.280
 It's the English.

1:35:39.280 --> 1:35:40.280
 You're getting to the standard too fast.

1:35:40.280 --> 1:35:41.280
 Wait, wait.

1:35:41.280 --> 1:35:42.280
 You're getting to the standard too fast.

1:35:42.280 --> 1:35:47.160
 But first I want to know, factually, is it true that all societies work like this?

1:35:47.160 --> 1:35:50.640
 Because if it's true that all societies work like this, then saying we should be free from

1:35:50.640 --> 1:35:52.120
 it is just a fantasy.

1:35:52.120 --> 1:35:53.120
 No.

1:35:53.120 --> 1:35:54.700
 A, I don't think all societies work like this.

1:35:54.700 --> 1:35:59.320
 I think much of what happened in America post founding in the 19th century didn't work like

1:35:59.320 --> 1:36:00.320
 that.

1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:03.320
 I think that's the genius of America, and I think what happened during the 19th century

1:36:03.320 --> 1:36:08.360
 in the Industrial Revolution, what happened in the 19th century to some extent globally

1:36:08.360 --> 1:36:11.000
 but certainly in the United States didn't work that way.

1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:12.000
 It broke tradition.

1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:16.920
 I think all innovation breaks tradition, and I think that's what the genius of this country

1:36:16.920 --> 1:36:21.400
 is and the post enlightenment world is.

1:36:21.400 --> 1:36:24.520
 I think pre that tradition, they work that way.

1:36:24.520 --> 1:36:28.280
 And then the question is, do people understand why they do what they do?

1:36:28.280 --> 1:36:35.060
 That is, I don't want people doing what I think is right just because I think it's right

1:36:35.060 --> 1:36:42.920
 and I've created a society in which somebody founded this country in a particular way,

1:36:42.920 --> 1:36:43.920
 so we're just going to follow.

1:36:43.920 --> 1:36:45.420
 I want people to understand what they're doing.

1:36:45.420 --> 1:36:48.960
 So I want people to have a respect for property, not because it's a tradition, but because

1:36:48.960 --> 1:36:53.000
 they understand the value of a respect for property.

1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:56.840
 I want people not to murder one another, not because there's a commandment, thou shall

1:36:56.840 --> 1:37:03.240
 not murder, but because they have an understanding of why murdering is bad and wrong and bad

1:37:03.240 --> 1:37:07.040
 for them and bad for the kind of world that they want to live in.

1:37:07.040 --> 1:37:13.080
 And I think that's what we achieve through enlightenment, through education, and where

1:37:13.080 --> 1:37:19.520
 we don't treat people just as a blob, a tribe that just follows orders, but we now treat

1:37:19.520 --> 1:37:25.840
 individuals as capable of thinking for themselves, capable for discovering truth, capable of

1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:30.840
 figuring out their own values, and that's the big break between.

1:37:30.840 --> 1:37:36.720
 And this is the break, I think, that the Declaration represents, the break between society that

1:37:36.720 --> 1:37:41.620
 is based on tradition, following commandments, following rules, because they are the rules,

1:37:41.620 --> 1:37:46.480
 because they are the commandments, and a society where individuals understand those rules,

1:37:46.480 --> 1:37:47.480
 understand.

1:37:47.480 --> 1:37:51.360
 Yes, it's now become a tradition, let's say, to respect individual rights, to respect

1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:54.840
 property rights, but they're not following it because it's a tradition.

1:37:54.840 --> 1:38:00.080
 They're following it because they understand what it is about it that makes it good.

1:38:00.080 --> 1:38:06.080
 So that's the world, I think, that we were on the process of evolving towards, and that

1:38:06.080 --> 1:38:11.000
 is what got destroyed in the 20th century and has certainly disappeared today.

1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:15.480
 And I think that's the great tragedy, is that we're evolving to a place where people understood

1:38:15.480 --> 1:38:18.320
 the values that represent it.

1:38:18.320 --> 1:38:23.360
 Of course, the danger with tradition is, I mean, we'll agree, right?

1:38:23.360 --> 1:38:25.880
 Yeah, it's okay to kill the Jew, right?

1:38:25.880 --> 1:38:30.080
 Or it's okay to steal people's property if they're of a certain color, or it's okay to

1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:31.080
 enslave.

1:38:31.080 --> 1:38:32.080
 Those are all traditions.

1:38:32.080 --> 1:38:36.320
 And yet, once you stop and say, but what are they based on?

1:38:36.320 --> 1:38:37.320
 Is this right?

1:38:37.320 --> 1:38:40.840
 Is this just, based on some moral law?

1:38:40.840 --> 1:38:42.440
 No, it's not.

1:38:42.440 --> 1:38:43.600
 There's something wrong here.

1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:46.440
 We can't achieve happiness and success if we follow these rules.

1:38:46.440 --> 1:38:50.220
 You're talking about reason and tradition, but I think I would love to sort of linger

1:38:50.220 --> 1:38:54.800
 on the stickiness of humans that you describe.

1:38:54.800 --> 1:39:00.000
 So you kind of said this primary, the individuals, is primary and that was a great invention.

1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:09.120
 But to me, it's not at all obvious that somehow, that the invention that humans have been practicing

1:39:09.120 --> 1:39:20.600
 for a very long time of the stickiness of community, of family, of love, that's not

1:39:20.600 --> 1:39:28.360
 obvious to me, that's not also fundamental to human flourishing and should be celebrated

1:39:28.360 --> 1:39:29.360
 and protected.

1:39:29.360 --> 1:39:30.360
 Of course it is.

1:39:30.360 --> 1:39:38.640
 Now, I suppose the argument you're making is when you start to let the state define

1:39:38.640 --> 1:39:42.760
 what the stickiness, how the stickiness looks between humans, so you're really like the

1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:44.600
 voluntary aspect.

1:39:44.600 --> 1:39:51.920
 But I just want to sort of, the observation is, humans seem to be pretty happy when they

1:39:51.920 --> 1:39:56.680
 form communities, however you define that.

1:39:56.680 --> 1:39:58.640
 So romantic partnership, family.

1:39:58.640 --> 1:39:59.800
 Some communities.

1:39:59.800 --> 1:40:01.320
 Some communities.

1:40:01.320 --> 1:40:02.860
 People are miserable in other communities.

1:40:02.860 --> 1:40:05.160
 So the nature of the community matters, right?

1:40:05.160 --> 1:40:06.160
 We know this.

1:40:06.160 --> 1:40:10.480
 We know that some bondings are not healthy and not good for the individuals involved

1:40:10.480 --> 1:40:13.040
 and they don't thrive.

1:40:13.040 --> 1:40:17.000
 So I absolutely, I mean, I'm a lover, not a fighter, right?

1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:18.840
 I'm a huge believer in love.

1:40:18.840 --> 1:40:22.040
 The whole philosophy I think is a love based philosophy.

1:40:22.040 --> 1:40:23.920
 I fight in order to love, right?

1:40:23.920 --> 1:40:30.200
 So love is at the core of all of this and it's a love of life.

1:40:30.200 --> 1:40:34.960
 It's a love of the world out there and it's a love of other people because they represent

1:40:34.960 --> 1:40:37.160
 a value to you.

1:40:37.160 --> 1:40:43.320
 So the stickiness is there, it's, you know, my point is A, it should be chosen.

1:40:43.320 --> 1:40:46.680
 It should be consciously chosen and this is, put aside the state.

1:40:46.680 --> 1:40:48.240
 Forget the state for a minute.

1:40:48.240 --> 1:40:49.360
 Forget coercion.

1:40:49.360 --> 1:40:51.160
 Forget all that.

1:40:51.160 --> 1:40:56.280
 What I would encourage individuals to do, and this is where, you know, I'm not primarily

1:40:56.280 --> 1:41:01.400
 a political, you know, interested in politics, although I tend to talk most about that.

1:41:01.400 --> 1:41:05.800
 I'm primarily interested in human beings and how they live in a sense in morality.

1:41:05.800 --> 1:41:11.440
 And what I would urge individuals to do is to think about their relationships, to choose

1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:16.920
 the best relationships possible, but to seek out great relationships because other human

1:41:16.920 --> 1:41:20.240
 beings are an immense value to us.

1:41:20.240 --> 1:41:25.320
 And you know, when I write, you know, maybe you won't quote this or not, but when I write

1:41:25.320 --> 1:41:31.600
 that, you know, about the trade of principle and trading, you know, it's easy and obvious

1:41:31.600 --> 1:41:34.080
 to think of it as a materialistic kind of thing.

1:41:34.080 --> 1:41:38.240
 You know, I get, you know, I do the chores this day and my wife does the chores the other

1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:39.520
 day and we're trading.

1:41:39.520 --> 1:41:42.960
 But trading is much more subtle than that and much more, can be much more spiritual

1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:43.960
 than that.

1:41:43.960 --> 1:41:48.240
 It's about the trading in emotions.

1:41:48.240 --> 1:41:53.720
 It's about the way one sees each other, it's what one gets from one another.

1:41:53.720 --> 1:41:55.800
 I think friendship is a form of trade.

1:41:55.800 --> 1:42:01.240
 Now I know that that seems to make it material, but I don't think of trade as a material

1:42:01.240 --> 1:42:02.240
 thing.

1:42:02.240 --> 1:42:04.360
 Friendship is incredibly important in life.

1:42:04.360 --> 1:42:06.520
 Love is incredibly important in life.

1:42:06.520 --> 1:42:10.280
 You know, having a group of friends is incredibly important in life.

1:42:10.280 --> 1:42:11.880
 All of these are sticky and important.

1:42:11.880 --> 1:42:12.880
 Okay.

1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:14.820
 How can I try to be eloquent on this?

1:42:14.820 --> 1:42:25.040
 So if you give people freedom, if you give people, well, not politics, relations, relationships.

1:42:25.040 --> 1:42:28.960
 So this is interesting because we have an interesting dynamic going on here in terms

1:42:28.960 --> 1:42:36.200
 of beliefs, they're differing and there was interesting overlaps, but there's a worry.

1:42:36.200 --> 1:42:39.800
 If you look at human history and you study the lessons of history and you look at modern

1:42:39.800 --> 1:42:45.560
 society, if you give people freedom in terms of stickiness and human relations and so on

1:42:45.560 --> 1:42:53.680
 full, like if you not give people freedom, emphasize freedom as the highest ideal.

1:42:53.680 --> 1:43:00.160
 You start getting more tender online dating, the stickiness dissolves just like in chemistry.

1:43:00.160 --> 1:43:03.880
 You start to have a gas versus a liquid, right?

1:43:03.880 --> 1:43:04.880
 That's the worry.

1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:08.560
 So you have to study what actually happens.

1:43:08.560 --> 1:43:17.680
 If you emphasize that the stickiness, the bonds of humans is holding you back, the exercise

1:43:17.680 --> 1:43:25.680
 of voluntary choice is the highest ideal, the danger of that is for that to be implemented

1:43:25.680 --> 1:43:31.720
 or interpreted in certain kinds of ways by us flawed humans that are not, I mean, you

1:43:31.720 --> 1:43:35.640
 could say we're perfectly reasonable and rational, we can think through all of our decisions,

1:43:35.640 --> 1:43:41.120
 but really, I mean, especially you're young, you get horny, you make decisions that are

1:43:41.120 --> 1:43:42.640
 suboptimal perhaps.

1:43:42.640 --> 1:43:49.400
 So the point is you have to look at reality of when you emphasize different things.

1:43:49.400 --> 1:43:55.560
 So when you talk about what is the ideal life, what is the ideal relations, you have to also

1:43:55.560 --> 1:43:57.320
 think like, what are you emphasizing?

1:43:57.320 --> 1:44:02.520
 I think you both agree on what's important, that community can be important, that freedom

1:44:02.520 --> 1:44:06.920
 is important, but what are you emphasizing and you're really emphasizing the individual

1:44:06.920 --> 1:44:16.720
 and you're emphasizing, Yoram, you're emphasizing more of the community, of the family, of the

1:44:16.720 --> 1:44:18.040
 stickiness of the nation.

1:44:18.040 --> 1:44:22.520
 Well, look, I don't want to deny the place of the individual.

1:44:22.520 --> 1:44:33.160
 I think that there really is a very great change in civilization when the books of Moses

1:44:33.160 --> 1:44:39.080
 announce that the individual is created in the image of God.

1:44:39.080 --> 1:44:46.320
 That's a step that's, as far as we know, without precedent before that in history, and to a

1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:53.280
 very large degree, I mean, one of the kind of unspoken things going on is that Yoram

1:44:53.280 --> 1:45:00.400
 and I really do agree on all sorts of things, I think in part because we're both Jewish.

1:45:00.400 --> 1:45:04.200
 You did say Yoram is basically Moses, yes sir.

1:45:04.200 --> 1:45:10.200
 No, I said he was channeling Moses, but that's still, in my book, that's still pretty impressive.

1:45:10.200 --> 1:45:13.720
 No, that's a compliment, I took it as one.

1:45:13.720 --> 1:45:14.720
 For me, that's a compliment.

1:45:14.720 --> 1:45:19.840
 And we'll talk about this a little bit just for the listeners, just so they know, Yoram,

1:45:19.840 --> 1:45:25.700
 amongst many things, we'll talk about the virtue of nationalism, but you're also a religious

1:45:25.700 --> 1:45:32.000
 scholar of sorts, or at least leverage the Bible for much, not much, but some of the

1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:33.520
 wisdom in your life.

1:45:33.520 --> 1:45:40.040
 Look, the way that Yoram looks at enlightenment, or maybe at Ayn Rand, that's the way that

1:45:40.040 --> 1:45:45.720
 I see the Hebrew scripture and the tradition that comes from it.

1:45:45.720 --> 1:45:51.600
 It has the same kind of place in my life, and I just, I don't know how much we want

1:45:51.600 --> 1:46:01.320
 to explore it, but I think that the agreement that we do have about the positive value of

1:46:01.320 --> 1:46:08.120
 the creative individual, the positive value of the individual's desire to improve the

1:46:08.120 --> 1:46:17.640
 world, and in my book that means including his or her desire to improve his family, his

1:46:17.640 --> 1:46:24.240
 tribe, his congregation, his nation, but it still comes from this kind of, what Yoram

1:46:24.240 --> 1:46:29.200
 calls selfishness, the desire to make things better for yourself.

1:46:29.200 --> 1:46:34.460
 In Hebrew Bible and in Judaism, that just is a positive thing.

1:46:34.460 --> 1:46:39.300
 Of course, it can be taken too far, but it just is positive, and it doesn't carry these

1:46:39.300 --> 1:46:44.180
 kinds of, you should turn the other cheek, you should give away your cloak, you should

1:46:44.180 --> 1:46:49.280
 love your enemy, these kinds of Christian tropes do not exist in Judaism, and so it

1:46:49.280 --> 1:46:55.120
 just, I like listening to Yoram, I do feel like he goes too far on various things, but

1:46:55.120 --> 1:47:04.520
 I also hear underneath it, I can sort of hear the Jewish current and the resistance to things

1:47:04.520 --> 1:47:06.520
 about Christianity that Jews often find.

1:47:06.520 --> 1:47:09.560
 Okay, I'll ask you a question there.

1:47:09.560 --> 1:47:12.720
 Can you make an argument for turn the other cheek?

1:47:12.720 --> 1:47:13.720
 No.

1:47:13.720 --> 1:47:18.760
 I tend to, I guess you would equate that with altruism.

1:47:18.760 --> 1:47:19.760
 I tend to.

1:47:19.760 --> 1:47:20.760
 Unjustice.

1:47:20.760 --> 1:47:23.760
 It's unjust to turn the other cheek.

1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:24.760
 I agree.

1:47:24.760 --> 1:47:25.760
 Okay.

1:47:25.760 --> 1:47:29.320
 You don't love yourself if you're turning the other cheek, it's a lack of love, lack

1:47:29.320 --> 1:47:30.320
 of self respect.

1:47:30.320 --> 1:47:38.520
 Well, let me push back on that, because I like turn the other cheek, especially on Twitter.

1:47:38.520 --> 1:47:42.720
 So I like block the offender on Twitter.

1:47:42.720 --> 1:47:54.240
 No, so Twitter aside is more like you're investing in the long term version of yourself versus

1:47:54.240 --> 1:47:55.800
 the short term.

1:47:55.800 --> 1:47:59.840
 So that's the way I think about it, is like the energy you put onto the world.

1:47:59.840 --> 1:48:05.520
 The turn the other cheek philosophy allows you to walk through the fire gracefully.

1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:06.520
 It's some sense.

1:48:06.520 --> 1:48:13.040
 I mean, perhaps you would reframe that as not, then that's not being altruistic or whatever,

1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:19.040
 but there is something pragmatic about that kind of approach to life.

1:48:19.040 --> 1:48:22.200
 Disciplining yourself so that you become a better version of yourself.

1:48:22.200 --> 1:48:28.960
 I mean, not only do we agree, but I think every religious and philosophical tradition

1:48:28.960 --> 1:48:35.320
 probably has a version of that, even Kant, who we joined together in finding to be terrible.

1:48:35.320 --> 1:48:39.240
 Even Kant makes that distinction between the short term interest and the long term interest.

1:48:39.240 --> 1:48:41.680
 So I think that's universal.

1:48:41.680 --> 1:48:44.380
 I don't know of anybody who's really disagreeing about that.

1:48:44.380 --> 1:48:49.280
 The thing that we were talking about a couple of minutes ago before we got onto this tangent

1:48:49.280 --> 1:48:59.280
 is the relationship between the individual who is in the image of God and is of value

1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:00.840
 as an individual.

1:49:00.840 --> 1:49:07.880
 Nevertheless, there's this question about what is good for that person and also what

1:49:07.880 --> 1:49:08.880
 makes him happy.

1:49:08.880 --> 1:49:13.160
 I'm not sure that those are exactly the same things, but they're both certainly relevant

1:49:13.160 --> 1:49:15.520
 and important.

1:49:15.520 --> 1:49:22.640
 And I feel like, I mean, I think we're beginning to uncover this empirical disagreement about

1:49:22.640 --> 1:49:25.240
 what it is that's good for the individual and what it is that makes them happy.

1:49:25.240 --> 1:49:32.400
 And I'll go back to something I raised in the debate, which is this theory of Durkheim

1:49:32.400 --> 1:49:40.280
 that now has been popularized by Jordan Peterson.

1:49:40.280 --> 1:49:48.200
 Durkheim argues that he's writing a book on suicide, he's trying to understand what

1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:54.840
 brings individuals to suicide, and he coins this term, anomie, lack of law.

1:49:54.840 --> 1:50:04.080
 And the argument is that individuals basically are healthy and happy when they find their

1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:06.920
 place in a hierarchy.

1:50:06.920 --> 1:50:11.680
 Within a loyalty group in a certain place in a hierarchy, they compete and struggle

1:50:11.680 --> 1:50:15.280
 in order to rise in the hierarchy, but they know where they are.

1:50:15.280 --> 1:50:16.400
 They know who they are.

1:50:16.400 --> 1:50:22.600
 The kids today like to say they know what their identity is because they associate themselves.

1:50:22.600 --> 1:50:27.920
 Their self expands to take on the leadership, the different layers, the past and the future

1:50:27.920 --> 1:50:29.920
 of this particular hierarchy.

1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:35.880
 And I completely agree with you, Ron, that some of these hierarchies are pernicious and

1:50:35.880 --> 1:50:40.800
 oppressive and terrible, and some of them are better.

1:50:40.800 --> 1:50:49.980
 What we might disagree about is that you can find human beings who are capable of becoming

1:50:49.980 --> 1:50:55.880
 healthy and happy off by themselves without participating in this kind of structure.

1:50:55.880 --> 1:51:01.760
 The minute that you accept, if you accept, that this is empirical reality about human

1:51:01.760 --> 1:51:06.920
 beings, it's an iron law, you can't do anything.

1:51:06.920 --> 1:51:11.680
 You can tell human beings that they can be free of all constraints, all you want, and

1:51:11.680 --> 1:51:19.480
 you can get them to do things that, as you say, they can have contempt for hierarchies.

1:51:19.480 --> 1:51:25.120
 They can say, I'm not going to serve the man, I'm just going to burn them all down.

1:51:25.120 --> 1:51:29.200
 You can get kids to say all of these things.

1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:34.880
 You can get them either to be Marxists who are actively trying to overthrow and destroy

1:51:34.880 --> 1:51:38.680
 the existing hierarchies, or you can make them some kind of liberal where they basically

1:51:38.680 --> 1:51:43.640
 pretend the hierarchies don't exist, they just act like they're not there.

1:51:43.640 --> 1:51:47.960
 In both cases, and it's not a coincidence that that's what universities teach is your

1:51:47.960 --> 1:51:53.680
 choice is either Marxist revolution or liberal ignoring of the hierarchies.

1:51:53.680 --> 1:51:58.980
 In both cases, what you've done is you've eliminated the possibility that the young

1:51:58.980 --> 1:52:08.120
 person will be able to find his or her place in a way that allows them to grow and exercise

1:52:08.120 --> 1:52:13.680
 their love, their drive, their creativity in order to advance something constructive.

1:52:13.680 --> 1:52:21.760
 You've eliminated it and you've put the burden on them, a kind of a Nietzschean burden, to

1:52:21.760 --> 1:52:29.360
 just be the fountain of all values yourself, which maybe some people can do it, but almost

1:52:29.360 --> 1:52:30.360
 no one can do it.

1:52:30.360 --> 1:52:32.440
 And I think that's empirically true.

1:52:32.440 --> 1:52:39.720
 And so I think by telling them about their freedom rather than telling them about the

1:52:39.720 --> 1:52:46.160
 need to join into some traditionalist hierarchy that can be good and healthy for them, I think

1:52:46.160 --> 1:52:47.160
 we're destroying them.

1:52:47.160 --> 1:52:51.320
 I think we're destroying this generation and the last one and the next.

1:52:51.320 --> 1:52:57.680
 Yaron, is the burden of freedom destroying mankind?

1:52:57.680 --> 1:52:58.680
 What freedom?

1:52:58.680 --> 1:53:01.640
 I mean, how many people are indeed free?

1:53:01.640 --> 1:53:09.920
 Look, the problem is that we're caught up on political concepts and we're moving into

1:53:09.920 --> 1:53:11.160
 ethical issues.

1:53:11.160 --> 1:53:17.880
 And I don't think it's right to tell people, you're free, go do whatever the hell you want.

1:53:17.880 --> 1:53:20.480
 Just use your emotions.

1:53:20.480 --> 1:53:23.520
 Just go where you want to go in the spur of the moment.

1:53:23.520 --> 1:53:24.520
 Think short term.

1:53:24.520 --> 1:53:25.520
 Don't think long term.

1:53:25.520 --> 1:53:26.520
 Well, don't think.

1:53:26.520 --> 1:53:27.600
 Why think?

1:53:27.600 --> 1:53:34.520
 One has to provide moral guidance and morality here is crucial and crucially important.

1:53:34.520 --> 1:53:40.360
 And part of taking responsibility for your own life is establishing a moral framework

1:53:40.360 --> 1:53:42.080
 for your life.

1:53:42.080 --> 1:53:44.480
 And what does it mean to live a good life?

1:53:44.480 --> 1:53:47.800
 I mean, that's much more important in a sense of a question.

1:53:47.800 --> 1:53:51.560
 And it is my belief that people can do that.

1:53:51.560 --> 1:53:57.400
 They can find and choose the values necessary to achieve a good life, but they need guidance.

1:53:57.400 --> 1:53:58.680
 They need guidance.

1:53:58.680 --> 1:54:01.680
 This is why religion evolved in my view, because people need guidance.

1:54:01.680 --> 1:54:06.160
 So I had called religion a primitive form of philosophy.

1:54:06.160 --> 1:54:10.440
 It was the original philosophy that provided people with some guidance about what to do

1:54:10.440 --> 1:54:11.600
 and what not to do.

1:54:11.600 --> 1:54:14.440
 And secular philosophy is supposed to do the same.

1:54:14.440 --> 1:54:21.560
 And the problem is that I think religion and 99% of secular philosophy give people bad

1:54:21.560 --> 1:54:25.840
 advice about what to do, and therefore they do bad stuff.

1:54:25.840 --> 1:54:33.880
 And sometimes because when they do good stuff, it gets reinforced, we survive in spite of

1:54:33.880 --> 1:54:34.880
 that.

1:54:34.880 --> 1:54:40.280
 But ideas like Kant and Hegel and Marx and so on give young people awful advice about

1:54:40.280 --> 1:54:43.880
 how to live and what to do, and as a consequence, really bad stuff happens.

1:54:43.880 --> 1:54:50.000
 And the world in which we exist today, which we agree there are a lot of pathologies to

1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:53.320
 it, a lot of bad stuff going on, in my view is going the wrong way.

1:54:53.320 --> 1:55:02.080
 In my view, a product of a set of ideas, on the one hand I think Christian ideas, on the

1:55:02.080 --> 1:55:06.920
 other hand I think secular philosophical ideas that have driven this country and the world

1:55:06.920 --> 1:55:09.760
 more generally in a really, really bad direction.

1:55:09.760 --> 1:55:16.040
 And this is why I do what I do, because I think at the core of it, the only way to change

1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:21.220
 it is not to impose a new set of ideas from the top, because I worry about who's going

1:55:21.220 --> 1:55:22.220
 to be doing the imposition.

1:55:22.220 --> 1:55:26.080
 Plus, I don't believe you can force people to be good.

1:55:26.080 --> 1:55:30.740
 It's to challenge the ideas, it's to question the ideas, it's to present an alternative

1:55:30.740 --> 1:55:36.760
 view of morality, an alternative set of moral principles, ultimately an alternative view

1:55:36.760 --> 1:55:37.760
 of political principles.

1:55:37.760 --> 1:55:40.120
 But it has to start with morality.

1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:43.720
 If you don't – and my morality is centered on the individual and what the individual

1:55:43.720 --> 1:55:49.920
 should do with his life in order to attain a good life, I believe that leads to happiness,

1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:53.400
 the good life, that's why it's good, right?

1:55:53.400 --> 1:55:58.960
 The goal is survival and thriving and flourishing and happiness, ultimately.

1:55:58.960 --> 1:56:02.080
 But politics is a servant of that in the end.

1:56:02.080 --> 1:56:04.360
 It's not an end in itself.

1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:08.120
 So the real issue is, you know, you asked before what is the value of relationship.

1:56:08.120 --> 1:56:11.200
 There's an enormous value in relationship because we get values from other people.

1:56:11.200 --> 1:56:12.600
 We don't produce all our values.

1:56:12.600 --> 1:56:17.040
 We don't produce all our spiritual values, and we don't produce all our material values.

1:56:17.040 --> 1:56:22.240
 Other people are a massive benefit to us because they produce values we can't – there's

1:56:22.240 --> 1:56:27.520
 a massive division of labor in terms of values, not just in economics, but also in philosophy

1:56:27.520 --> 1:56:28.520
 and elsewhere.

1:56:28.520 --> 1:56:29.520
 It's why we have teachers.

1:56:29.520 --> 1:56:31.080
 It's why we have moral teachers.

1:56:31.080 --> 1:56:34.560
 Moral teachers are important to help guide us towards a good life.

1:56:34.560 --> 1:56:36.140
 Not all of us are philosophers.

1:56:36.140 --> 1:56:41.840
 But what I do demand, if you all are individuals – this is where I put a burden on people,

1:56:41.840 --> 1:56:42.840
 right?

1:56:42.840 --> 1:56:45.180
 Understand what you're doing, right?

1:56:45.180 --> 1:56:49.680
 You know, don't embrace a moral teaching because it was tradition.

1:56:49.680 --> 1:56:53.080
 Don't embrace a moral teaching because your parents embraced it.

1:56:53.080 --> 1:56:57.680
 Don't embrace a moral teaching just because your teachers are teaching it.

1:56:57.680 --> 1:56:58.680
 Challenge it.

1:56:58.680 --> 1:56:59.680
 Think about it.

1:56:59.680 --> 1:57:01.840
 Embrace it because you – embrace it.

1:57:01.840 --> 1:57:02.960
 You might be wrong.

1:57:02.960 --> 1:57:06.440
 You might embrace the wrong one, but take moral responsibility.

1:57:06.440 --> 1:57:13.920
 Take responsibility over your life by evaluating, testing, challenging what you have received

1:57:13.920 --> 1:57:18.600
 and choosing what you're going to pursue.

1:57:18.600 --> 1:57:25.520
 And I acknowledge empirically that most people don't do that, and this is why intellectual

1:57:25.520 --> 1:57:28.040
 leadership is so important.

1:57:28.040 --> 1:57:33.440
 This is why you want to get – you want the voices in a culture to be good voices so that

1:57:33.440 --> 1:57:38.080
 those people who don't think for themselves end up being followers, but they end up being

1:57:38.080 --> 1:57:41.520
 followers of somebody good versus followers of somebody bad.

1:57:41.520 --> 1:57:45.680
 But for the thinkers in the world out there, who I think are the people who count, who

1:57:45.680 --> 1:57:46.680
 are the people who shape society –

1:57:46.680 --> 1:57:47.680
 Oh, boy.

1:57:47.680 --> 1:57:48.680
 No, no.

1:57:48.680 --> 1:57:49.680
 Shape society.

1:57:49.680 --> 1:57:50.680
 Wait a minute.

1:57:50.680 --> 1:57:53.840
 Not count in a sense that you can dismiss the lives of others and, you know, because

1:57:53.840 --> 1:57:56.200
 I'm – you know, obviously I'm anti coercion and anti violence, but –

1:57:56.200 --> 1:57:57.200
 They sound like Plato.

1:57:57.200 --> 1:57:58.200
 But – yes.

1:57:58.200 --> 1:58:00.440
 I don't want to sound like Plato.

1:58:00.440 --> 1:58:03.840
 But in a sense that they're the ones who shape – who end up shaping the world.

1:58:03.840 --> 1:58:06.640
 They're the ones who end up shaping how the world is.

1:58:06.640 --> 1:58:12.200
 I want those people to make choices about their values and not to just accept them based

1:58:12.200 --> 1:58:16.880
 on tradition or based on the commandment or based on where they happen to grow up.

1:58:16.880 --> 1:58:24.120
 And in that sense, again, you know, I do – and this is an interesting point where we disagree,

1:58:24.120 --> 1:58:26.320
 but I'm not exactly sure what Jerome's position is.

1:58:26.320 --> 1:58:28.040
 I do believe in universal values.

1:58:28.040 --> 1:58:31.560
 That is, there are things that are good, and there are things that are evil.

1:58:31.560 --> 1:58:32.960
 And I think we'd agree on that.

1:58:32.960 --> 1:58:36.880
 When there are systems, we agree that communism and fascism are evil.

1:58:36.880 --> 1:58:40.400
 Well, I think we should be able to agree that some things – some political systems are

1:58:40.400 --> 1:58:41.400
 good.

1:58:41.400 --> 1:58:46.680
 And maybe there's this middle ground where we both think that they're not particularly

1:58:46.680 --> 1:58:49.880
 bad but not particularly good, and you all might think they're better than I think

1:58:49.880 --> 1:58:50.880
 they are.

1:58:50.880 --> 1:58:55.800
 But if we can agree on this is good and this is evil, right, then the systems that tend

1:58:55.800 --> 1:59:00.240
 towards the good are good, and the systems that tend towards the evil are evil.

1:59:00.240 --> 1:59:02.120
 But that's universal, right?

1:59:02.120 --> 1:59:07.960
 You know, I look at places like South Korea, Japan, Asia – you know, cultures that are

1:59:07.960 --> 1:59:10.720
 very, very different in many respects in the West.

1:59:10.720 --> 1:59:19.040
 And yet when they adopt certain Western ideas about freedom, about liberty, about individualism

1:59:19.040 --> 1:59:22.520
 – I mean, the Japanese Constitution, because MacArthur forced it in there, has the pursuit

1:59:22.520 --> 1:59:26.360
 of happiness in the Constitution, not because they chose it because he put it in there.

1:59:26.360 --> 1:59:32.920
 But they, to some extent, adopted that, and they're successful places today.

1:59:32.920 --> 1:59:37.060
 Those societies in Asia that didn't adopt these values are not successful societies

1:59:37.060 --> 1:59:38.060
 today.

1:59:38.060 --> 1:59:47.280
 Yaron, Japan has a birth rate of, what is it, 1.1, 1.2 children per woman?

1:59:47.280 --> 1:59:54.960
 I mean, look, there are some things – there are some places where you give people freedom

1:59:54.960 --> 1:59:57.520
 – this is also biblical, right?

1:59:57.520 --> 2:00:01.880
 The idea that everyone did what's right in his own eyes, okay?

2:00:01.880 --> 2:00:06.560
 This is a refrain in the Book of Judges.

2:00:06.560 --> 2:00:08.720
 And the Bible is not an anti–freedom book.

2:00:08.720 --> 2:00:10.720
 I mean, there's many, many – look, I –

2:00:10.720 --> 2:00:11.720
 Well, let's talk –

2:00:11.720 --> 2:00:12.720
 No, we're not – fine.

2:00:12.720 --> 2:00:13.720
 Well, we –

2:00:13.720 --> 2:00:14.720
 Oh, we'll get there.

2:00:14.720 --> 2:00:15.720
 Okay.

2:00:15.720 --> 2:00:16.720
 Oh, he's going to guide us.

2:00:16.720 --> 2:00:21.440
 Okay, look, just as an asterisk, I'm not asking you because the Bible is such a great

2:00:21.440 --> 2:00:24.600
 authoritarian book – it's not that at all.

2:00:24.600 --> 2:00:33.160
 In my view, if you want to know where this – what you call the sanctity of property,

2:00:33.160 --> 2:00:35.280
 where does the sanctity of property comes from?

2:00:35.280 --> 2:00:36.520
 It comes from the Ten Commandments.

2:00:36.520 --> 2:00:40.160
 It comes from Moses saying, I haven't taken anything from anyone.

2:00:40.160 --> 2:00:42.800
 It comes from Samuel saying, I haven't taken anything from anyone.

2:00:42.800 --> 2:00:49.400
 It's the condemnation of Ahab, of the unjust kings who steal the property of their subjects.

2:00:49.400 --> 2:00:57.160
 So, property and freedom, I think there's a great basis for it in the Bible.

2:00:57.160 --> 2:01:03.960
 But right now, I'm focusing on this other question, which is what happens when everyone

2:01:03.960 --> 2:01:05.640
 does what's right in his own eyes?

2:01:05.640 --> 2:01:12.600
 That's the Book of Judges, and that's this civil war, moral corruption, theft, idolatry,

2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:18.120
 murder, rape – I mean, that's what happens when everyone does whatever is right in his

2:01:18.120 --> 2:01:19.120
 own eyes.

2:01:19.120 --> 2:01:22.160
 Well, no, that's what it says in the text.

2:01:22.160 --> 2:01:28.280
 Okay, so when I look at – you're right, there are things that I think are objectively

2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:29.280
 true.

2:01:29.280 --> 2:01:33.960
 I think it's really hard to get people to agree to them, almost impossible.

2:01:33.960 --> 2:01:44.640
 But when I look at a country which is approaching one birth per woman – in other words, half

2:01:44.640 --> 2:01:50.040
 of the minimum necessary for replacement – you can say whatever you want.

2:01:50.040 --> 2:01:52.960
 Whatever you want about immigration, we can have that discussion.

2:01:52.960 --> 2:02:00.160
 But the point is that when your values are such that you're not even capable of doing

2:02:00.160 --> 2:02:04.800
 the most basic techniques that human beings need in order to be able to propagate themselves

2:02:04.800 --> 2:02:09.880
 and their values and the way they see things, then I – look, you're finished.

2:02:09.880 --> 2:02:10.880
 You can't say that –

2:02:10.880 --> 2:02:15.600
 So if I implied that Japan is an ideal society, I take that back.

2:02:15.600 --> 2:02:17.920
 But let's think about Japan for a minute.

2:02:17.920 --> 2:02:20.480
 I just think we're in trouble, and we're in trouble –

2:02:20.480 --> 2:02:21.480
 I agree with –

2:02:21.480 --> 2:02:22.480
 All right, all right.

2:02:22.480 --> 2:02:23.480
 Give me a second.

2:02:23.480 --> 2:02:24.480
 I'll hold you to that.

2:02:24.480 --> 2:02:25.480
 It's being a tutorial.

2:02:25.480 --> 2:02:26.480
 No, I'm sorry.

2:02:26.480 --> 2:02:27.480
 It's his show, man.

2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:28.480
 It is his show.

2:02:28.480 --> 2:02:31.040
 We enter into his hierarchy and that's it.

2:02:31.040 --> 2:02:35.120
 We should talk about hierarchy.

2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:39.440
 Just to clarify, how do you explain the situation in Japan?

2:02:39.440 --> 2:02:45.000
 Is it the decrease in value in family, like some of the – just expand on that.

2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:47.160
 How do you explain that situation?

2:02:47.160 --> 2:02:50.440
 You're saying that that society is in trouble in a certain way.

2:02:50.440 --> 2:02:53.320
 Can you kind of describe the nature of that trouble?

2:02:53.320 --> 2:03:02.000
 I'm saying that when the individual is part of a social group – this can be a family,

2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:08.640
 a congregation, a community, a tribe, a nation – when the individual feels that the things

2:03:08.640 --> 2:03:13.640
 that are happening to the society are things that are happening to him or to her.

2:03:13.640 --> 2:03:21.840
 And I want to emphasize, this is not the standard view of collectivism that Mussolini will say,

2:03:21.840 --> 2:03:27.400
 the glory of the individual is in totally immersing himself in the organic whole.

2:03:27.400 --> 2:03:28.400
 That's not what I'm saying.

2:03:28.400 --> 2:03:32.360
 I'm saying that human beings have and are both.

2:03:32.360 --> 2:03:41.240
 They enter into a society to which they are loyal and they compete with one another in

2:03:41.240 --> 2:03:45.320
 the terms that that society allows competition, but also sometimes by bending the rules and

2:03:45.320 --> 2:03:49.000
 by shaping them and by changing them.

2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:55.080
 What you see in many societies, certainly throughout the liberal West, but also in countries

2:03:55.080 --> 2:04:00.740
 that have been affected by the liberal West, by industrialization and ideas of individualism,

2:04:00.740 --> 2:04:08.980
 what you see is a collapse of a willingness of the individual to look at what is needed

2:04:08.980 --> 2:04:18.360
 by the whole and to make choices that are, as Jorn would call them, selfish because the

2:04:18.360 --> 2:04:26.760
 purpose of them is self expression, competition, self assertion, moving up in the hierarchy,

2:04:26.760 --> 2:04:31.720
 achieving honor or wealth in order to do those things.

2:04:31.720 --> 2:04:38.260
 But when you stop being able to look at the framework of a particular society and identify

2:04:38.260 --> 2:04:46.240
 with it, you cease to understand what it is that you need to do, not every single person,

2:04:46.240 --> 2:04:48.080
 but I'm talking about society wide.

2:04:48.080 --> 2:04:51.500
 So there are a few individuals who are just going to have a fantastic time and live the

2:04:51.500 --> 2:04:56.880
 kind of life that Jorn is describing, and the great majority, they stop being willing

2:04:56.880 --> 2:04:58.080
 to take risks.

2:04:58.080 --> 2:04:59.780
 They stop being willing to get married.

2:04:59.780 --> 2:05:01.400
 They stop being willing to have children.

2:05:01.400 --> 2:05:03.280
 They stop being willing to start companies.

2:05:03.280 --> 2:05:09.440
 They stop being willing to put themselves out to do great things because the guide rails

2:05:09.440 --> 2:05:15.060
 that told them what kinds of things and the social feedback that honored them when they

2:05:15.060 --> 2:05:19.020
 did things like getting married and having children, they've been crushed.

2:05:19.020 --> 2:05:20.360
 And what have they been crushed by?

2:05:20.360 --> 2:05:25.840
 They've been crushed by the false view that if you tell the individual, be free, make

2:05:25.840 --> 2:05:29.360
 all your own decisions, that they will then be free and make all their own decisions.

2:05:29.360 --> 2:05:30.360
 They don't.

2:05:30.360 --> 2:05:31.360
 They just stop.

2:05:31.360 --> 2:05:33.760
 They stop being human.

2:05:33.760 --> 2:05:34.760
 That's powerful.

2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:36.760
 So do you want to respond to that?

2:05:36.760 --> 2:05:38.260
 Yes.

2:05:38.260 --> 2:05:40.320
 So I don't think anybody should have children.

2:05:40.320 --> 2:05:50.000
 If the goal, there's a good tweet clip that you can make.

2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:55.960
 I don't think anybody should have children for the goal of perpetuating their nation

2:05:55.960 --> 2:06:03.320
 or expanding their society or for some, I think they'd make horrible parents if that

2:06:03.320 --> 2:06:06.400
 was the goal, the purpose of doing it.

2:06:06.400 --> 2:06:10.120
 I think people should have children because they want to embrace that challenge, that

2:06:10.120 --> 2:06:18.640
 beauty, that experience, that amazing, very, very hard, very, very difficult experience

2:06:18.640 --> 2:06:19.640
 in life.

2:06:19.640 --> 2:06:24.680
 And it's about being able to project a long term, but also being able to enjoy and love

2:06:24.680 --> 2:06:28.040
 the creation of another human being, that process of creation.

2:06:28.040 --> 2:06:30.220
 It is a beautiful, self interested thing.

2:06:30.220 --> 2:06:32.160
 And by the way, not everybody should have children.

2:06:32.160 --> 2:06:34.800
 I think way too many people have children.

2:06:34.800 --> 2:06:38.360
 There's some awful parents out there that I wish would stop.

2:06:38.360 --> 2:06:39.720
 I mean, there are.

2:06:39.720 --> 2:06:43.760
 Life is precious and life of suffering is sad.

2:06:43.760 --> 2:06:47.920
 It's sad to see people suffer and a lot of people are born into situations and are born

2:06:47.920 --> 2:06:52.320
 into parents that destroy their capacity to ever live a good life.

2:06:52.320 --> 2:06:57.880
 And that's a tragic and sad thing.

2:06:57.880 --> 2:07:04.240
 So I don't measure the health of a society in how many children they're having or health

2:07:04.240 --> 2:07:06.700
 of a couple of whether they have children or not.

2:07:06.700 --> 2:07:07.800
 Those are individual choices.

2:07:07.800 --> 2:07:12.380
 Some people make a choice not to have children, which is completely rational and consistent

2:07:12.380 --> 2:07:13.920
 with their values.

2:07:13.920 --> 2:07:18.400
 Now when you look at a society overall, I do think having children and not having children

2:07:18.400 --> 2:07:20.160
 is a reflection of something.

2:07:20.160 --> 2:07:22.920
 I think it's a reflection of a certain optimism about the future.

2:07:22.920 --> 2:07:26.200
 I think it's a reflection of thinking long term versus short term.

2:07:26.200 --> 2:07:28.400
 I think a short term society doesn't have children.

2:07:28.400 --> 2:07:32.880
 People don't have children there because children are a long term investment.

2:07:32.880 --> 2:07:38.000
 They require real planning and real effort and real thinking about the long term.

2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:39.720
 But those are moral issues.

2:07:39.720 --> 2:07:43.440
 And again, we're confusing or mixing.

2:07:43.440 --> 2:07:45.960
 When I say Japan, look how well Japan has done.

2:07:45.960 --> 2:07:49.720
 I don't mean the specific Japanese people and how many kids they're having and what

2:07:49.720 --> 2:07:53.920
 kind of life they're having in terms of these kind of particulars.

2:07:53.920 --> 2:08:01.020
 But think about the alternatives Japan faces if you look around the options that they face.

2:08:01.020 --> 2:08:02.640
 They tried empire.

2:08:02.640 --> 2:08:04.120
 They tried nationalistic empire.

2:08:04.120 --> 2:08:08.320
 It didn't turn out too well for them or anybody who they interacted with.

2:08:08.320 --> 2:08:11.020
 They could have become North Korea.

2:08:11.020 --> 2:08:12.100
 We know how that turned out.

2:08:12.100 --> 2:08:13.100
 We know what that is.

2:08:13.100 --> 2:08:16.600
 We've seen Cambodia, if you've ever been to Cambodia and seen the kind of poverty.

2:08:16.600 --> 2:08:22.400
 And yes, maybe Cambodians have lots of children, but God, I'd rather be in Japan any day than

2:08:22.400 --> 2:08:27.240
 have children in the kind of poverty and horrific circumstances they have.

2:08:27.240 --> 2:08:34.760
 But in the context of the available regimes that were possible post World War II for the

2:08:34.760 --> 2:08:39.920
 Japanese to embrace, they embraced one that generally led to prosperity, to freedom, to

2:08:39.920 --> 2:08:45.320
 individuals pursuing values, not perfectly because they didn't implement the philosophical

2:08:45.320 --> 2:08:48.680
 foundation, the moral foundation that I would like them to have.

2:08:48.680 --> 2:08:54.680
 They're still being impacted by Kantian, Hegelian, whatever philosophy that's out there in the

2:08:54.680 --> 2:08:57.520
 West that's destroying the better part.

2:08:57.520 --> 2:09:00.800
 So you give people freedom, now what do they do with it?

2:09:00.800 --> 2:09:05.720
 And if they have a bad philosophy, they're going to do bad things with that freedom.

2:09:05.720 --> 2:09:08.660
 You tell people to do whatever they choose to do.

2:09:08.660 --> 2:09:12.980
 But if they have bad ideas, they will choose to do bad things.

2:09:12.980 --> 2:09:19.720
 So it is true that the primacy of morality and the primacy of philosophy has to be recognized.

2:09:19.720 --> 2:09:21.660
 It's not the primacy of politics.

2:09:21.660 --> 2:09:29.220
 And indeed, you don't get free societies unless you have some elements of decent philosophy.

2:09:29.220 --> 2:09:33.720
 But you can get free societies with a rotten philosophy, but they don't stay free for very

2:09:33.720 --> 2:09:34.720
 long.

2:09:34.720 --> 2:09:39.720
 So how can it be a decent philosophy if it doesn't care about posterity?

2:09:39.720 --> 2:09:46.820
 If you're willing to say, I'm offering guidance, I think you should live as a traitor, all

2:09:46.820 --> 2:09:50.520
 relationships should be voluntary, those are interesting things.

2:09:50.520 --> 2:09:55.800
 But the moment that it comes to posterity, to the future, to there being a future, let's

2:09:55.800 --> 2:10:00.120
 say that there were a society that lived the way, in general, according to your view.

2:10:00.120 --> 2:10:02.000
 Let's say there was such a society.

2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:06.440
 How can you not care whether that society is capable of passing it on to the next generation

2:10:06.440 --> 2:10:07.440
 or not?

2:10:07.440 --> 2:10:11.880
 But the way to pass it on to the next generation is through ideas and not through having children.

2:10:11.880 --> 2:10:15.280
 Having children is an individual choice that some people are going to make and some people

2:10:15.280 --> 2:10:19.880
 are not, but the fundamental that preserves the good life.

2:10:19.880 --> 2:10:23.000
 What does that even mean?

2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:28.500
 If every generation from now on, your society that was good at a certain point has half

2:10:28.500 --> 2:10:33.120
 as many people in it, it's going to very quickly, it's just going to be overrun.

2:10:33.120 --> 2:10:35.080
 Overrun by whom?

2:10:35.080 --> 2:10:36.240
 What do you mean overrun by whom?

2:10:36.240 --> 2:10:38.360
 Are we just totally ahistorical?

2:10:38.360 --> 2:10:43.880
 If you're the Spartans and you have all of these warrior values, but you stop having

2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:45.840
 children, you get overrun, you get defeated.

2:10:45.840 --> 2:10:47.960
 Well, in the case of Sparta, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.

2:10:47.960 --> 2:10:48.960
 But I get it.

2:10:48.960 --> 2:10:49.960
 That's not my point.

2:10:49.960 --> 2:10:54.720
 You have to have the ability to have enough children to create enough wealth and enough

2:10:54.720 --> 2:10:56.040
 power, enough strength.

2:10:56.040 --> 2:11:01.160
 Who makes these kind of conclusions, the decisions about how many you make it as an individual

2:11:01.160 --> 2:11:03.440
 and you decide that in order to...

2:11:03.440 --> 2:11:04.880
 No, we're not talking about...

2:11:04.880 --> 2:11:10.040
 We're talking about what kind of intellectual, cultural, religious inheritance you give your

2:11:10.040 --> 2:11:11.040
 children.

2:11:11.040 --> 2:11:12.040
 Yes.

2:11:12.040 --> 2:11:15.440
 And those are the ideas that I give my children and those ideas are going to perpetuate because

2:11:15.440 --> 2:11:16.440
 they're good ideas.

2:11:16.440 --> 2:11:17.440
 If they're bad ideas...

2:11:17.440 --> 2:11:18.440
 No, they're not going to perpetuate.

2:11:18.440 --> 2:11:23.160
 They can't be good ideas if they don't produce future generations.

2:11:23.160 --> 2:11:24.160
 What are you talking about?

2:11:24.160 --> 2:11:26.160
 Why would they not produce future generations?

2:11:26.160 --> 2:11:32.040
 Because look at every liberal society on earth is in democratic collapse.

2:11:32.040 --> 2:11:36.920
 There's not a single liberal society on earth today that I'm willing to defend.

2:11:36.920 --> 2:11:40.800
 Because they're not living by my philosophy, they've not accepted my ideas.

2:11:40.800 --> 2:11:46.240
 They have a semblance, they have a semblance of a political system that is a little bit

2:11:46.240 --> 2:11:50.920
 like what I would like, far from what I would ideal, but they certainly don't have a moral

2:11:50.920 --> 2:11:51.920
 foundation.

2:11:51.920 --> 2:11:55.840
 I believe that people who have the right moral foundation, most of them, not all of them,

2:11:55.840 --> 2:12:00.240
 but most of them will have children, most of them will continue into the future, most

2:12:00.240 --> 2:12:06.640
 of them will fight for a future, but not because they care what happens in 200 years, but because

2:12:06.640 --> 2:12:11.240
 they care about their lifetime and part of having fun and enjoying one's lifetime is

2:12:11.240 --> 2:12:14.720
 having kids, is projecting into the future.

2:12:14.720 --> 2:12:19.120
 Are you really going to tell me that people have children because it's fun?

2:12:19.120 --> 2:12:20.560
 They're fun when they're four years old.

2:12:20.560 --> 2:12:23.280
 They're not fun when they're 15.

2:12:23.280 --> 2:12:24.280
 When they're 15, they're not fun.

2:12:24.280 --> 2:12:25.280
 I agree with that.

2:12:25.280 --> 2:12:26.280
 No, they're just not fun.

2:12:26.280 --> 2:12:27.280
 Look, you don't do this.

2:12:27.280 --> 2:12:28.820
 I'm learning so much today.

2:12:28.820 --> 2:12:31.360
 You don't do this for fun.

2:12:31.360 --> 2:12:32.640
 Marriage also you don't do for fun.

2:12:32.640 --> 2:12:35.400
 There are times that are fun and there are times that are not fun.

2:12:35.400 --> 2:12:40.320
 Fun is not exactly the right word, but you certainly do it for happiness.

2:12:40.320 --> 2:12:42.040
 You do it for fulfillment.

2:12:42.040 --> 2:12:43.760
 You do it as a challenge.

2:12:43.760 --> 2:12:49.960
 You do it for making your life better, for making your life interesting, for making your

2:12:49.960 --> 2:12:53.840
 life challenging, for embracing.

2:12:53.840 --> 2:13:01.000
 Part of it is fun, part of it is hard work, but you do it because it makes your life a

2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:02.000
 better life.

2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:07.240
 It's very interesting, empirically speaking, if you dissolve the cultural backbone where

2:13:07.240 --> 2:13:12.360
 everybody comes up, like the background, the moral ideas that everybody is raised with,

2:13:12.360 --> 2:13:19.560
 if you dissolve that and if you truly emphasize the individual, I think Yoram is saying it's

2:13:19.560 --> 2:13:24.160
 going to naturally lead to the dissolution of marriage and all of these concepts.

2:13:24.160 --> 2:13:30.200
 So basically saying you're not going to choose some of these things.

2:13:30.200 --> 2:13:37.560
 You're going to more and more choose the short term optimization versus the long term optimization

2:13:37.560 --> 2:13:40.720
 beyond your own life, like posterity.

2:13:40.720 --> 2:13:42.040
 So I don't think about posterity.

2:13:42.040 --> 2:13:43.640
 I don't know what posterity means.

2:13:43.640 --> 2:13:46.520
 I can project into my children's life.

2:13:46.520 --> 2:13:49.280
 Maybe when I have grandchildren, it's the grandchildren's life, but it ends there.

2:13:49.280 --> 2:13:52.120
 I can't project 300 years into the future.

2:13:52.120 --> 2:13:54.820
 It's ridiculous to try to think about 300 years into the future.

2:13:54.820 --> 2:13:56.320
 Things change so much.

2:13:56.320 --> 2:13:58.640
 But that's the founding fathers.

2:13:58.640 --> 2:13:59.920
 That's the conservative founding fathers.

2:13:59.920 --> 2:14:01.200
 Well, no, I don't think.

2:14:01.200 --> 2:14:02.520
 I think they set up a system.

2:14:02.520 --> 2:14:09.080
 I think the whole idea was to set up a system that was self perpetuating that would if people

2:14:09.080 --> 2:14:10.320
 lived up to it, right?

2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:11.320
 No, no.

2:14:11.320 --> 2:14:12.320
 Would perpetuate itself into 300 years.

2:14:12.320 --> 2:14:14.200
 No systems are self perpetuating.

2:14:14.200 --> 2:14:15.720
 Things rise and fall and it's the...

2:14:15.720 --> 2:14:16.720
 They don't necessarily rise and fall.

2:14:16.720 --> 2:14:17.720
 I don't believe in that.

2:14:17.720 --> 2:14:21.520
 Let me speak to your heart for a second.

2:14:21.520 --> 2:14:27.480
 The great individuals in societies are the people who have seen the decline, understood

2:14:27.480 --> 2:14:32.160
 it and provided resources in order to redirect and bring it back up.

2:14:32.160 --> 2:14:34.240
 You can't agree to that?

2:14:34.240 --> 2:14:36.360
 I don't see it that way at all.

2:14:36.360 --> 2:14:41.480
 Yes, I want people out there to rebel against conventional morality.

2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:46.000
 I think conventional morality is destructive to their own lives and broadly to posterity

2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:48.920
 because I think it's unsustainable, it's not good and this goes to...

2:14:48.920 --> 2:14:51.520
 I think conventional morality is Christian morality.

2:14:51.520 --> 2:14:55.880
 It's a morality that's been secularized through Christian lens and I think it's destructive,

2:14:55.880 --> 2:14:59.520
 but I don't want them to dump that and not replace it with something.

2:14:59.520 --> 2:15:05.480
 I want and I think it's necessary and essential for people to have a moral code and to have

2:15:05.480 --> 2:15:08.160
 a moral code.

2:15:08.160 --> 2:15:11.040
 Morality is a set of guidelines to live your life.

2:15:11.040 --> 2:15:15.840
 It is a set of values to guide you, to help you identify what is good for you and what

2:15:15.840 --> 2:15:16.840
 is bad for you.

2:15:16.840 --> 2:15:17.840
 Here's the thing.

2:15:17.840 --> 2:15:18.840
 Let me argue against it.

2:15:18.840 --> 2:15:19.840
 Let me...

2:15:19.840 --> 2:15:20.840
 Hold on a second.

2:15:20.840 --> 2:15:25.680
 You're saying central to this morality that people should have is reason.

2:15:25.680 --> 2:15:26.680
 Yes.

2:15:26.680 --> 2:15:27.680
 Okay.

2:15:27.680 --> 2:15:28.680
 You're not saying other things.

2:15:28.680 --> 2:15:32.720
 You're basically saying reason will arrive a lot of things.

2:15:32.720 --> 2:15:36.040
 Why are you so sure that reason is so important?

2:15:36.040 --> 2:15:37.040
 There's nothing else.

2:15:37.040 --> 2:15:38.040
 No.

2:15:38.040 --> 2:15:39.040
 Hold on a second.

2:15:39.040 --> 2:15:40.760
 But it seems like obvious to you.

2:15:40.760 --> 2:15:43.440
 So first of all, humans have limited cognitive capacity.

2:15:43.440 --> 2:15:50.040
 So even to assume the reason could actually function that well from an artificial intelligence

2:15:50.040 --> 2:15:51.040
 researcher perspective.

2:15:51.040 --> 2:15:52.040
 It seems...

2:15:52.040 --> 2:15:57.000
 The whole discussion about whether there is such a thing as artificial intelligence, whether

2:15:57.000 --> 2:15:58.000
 that is what it is.

2:15:58.000 --> 2:15:59.000
 But...

2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:00.000
 But see, here's the thing.

2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:03.940
 I mean, you're very confident about this particular thing, but not about other aspects of human

2:16:03.940 --> 2:16:06.360
 nature that seems to be obviously present.

2:16:06.360 --> 2:16:12.920
 So yes, human relations, love, connection between us.

2:16:12.920 --> 2:16:17.800
 So it's very possible to argue that all of the accomplishments of reason would not exist

2:16:17.800 --> 2:16:19.800
 without the connection of other humans.

2:16:19.800 --> 2:16:21.080
 But of course that's true.

2:16:21.080 --> 2:16:22.480
 It's not obvious though.

2:16:22.480 --> 2:16:28.200
 It's possible that reason is a property of the collective of multiple people interacting

2:16:28.200 --> 2:16:29.200
 with each other.

2:16:29.200 --> 2:16:32.860
 When you look at the greatest inventions of human history, some people tell that story

2:16:32.860 --> 2:16:35.040
 by individual inventors.

2:16:35.040 --> 2:16:36.520
 You could argue that's true.

2:16:36.520 --> 2:16:41.240
 Some people say that it's a bunch of people in a room together.

2:16:41.240 --> 2:16:42.560
 The idea is bubbling.

2:16:42.560 --> 2:16:48.720
 And if you're saying individual is primary and they have the full power and the capacity

2:16:48.720 --> 2:16:52.840
 to make choices, I don't know if that's necessarily obviously true.

2:16:52.840 --> 2:16:56.880
 So there's a straw manning going on here of my position, right?

2:16:56.880 --> 2:16:57.880
 Of course.

2:16:57.880 --> 2:17:00.520
 My favorite thing to do.

2:17:00.520 --> 2:17:04.160
 You don't do it and you do it more politely than anybody else I know when you do it.

2:17:04.160 --> 2:17:06.480
 Of course we all stand on the shoulders of giants.

2:17:06.480 --> 2:17:10.780
 Of course, invention and science is collaborative.

2:17:10.780 --> 2:17:13.880
 Not always, not a hundred percent.

2:17:13.880 --> 2:17:16.040
 Newton stood on the shoulders of giants.

2:17:16.040 --> 2:17:17.720
 I don't know how collaborative he was.

2:17:17.720 --> 2:17:22.960
 He wasn't exactly known as a bubbling up and testing ideas out with other people.

2:17:22.960 --> 2:17:25.000
 But this is a metaphysical fact.

2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:26.520
 You can't eat for me.

2:17:26.520 --> 2:17:28.360
 There's no collective stomach.

2:17:28.360 --> 2:17:30.160
 You can't eat for me.

2:17:30.160 --> 2:17:33.420
 You know, you can provide me with food, but I need to do the eating.

2:17:33.420 --> 2:17:35.240
 You can't think for me.

2:17:35.240 --> 2:17:37.400
 You can help stimulate my thought.

2:17:37.400 --> 2:17:39.200
 You can challenge my thinking.

2:17:39.200 --> 2:17:41.040
 You can add to it.

2:17:41.040 --> 2:17:44.480
 But in the end of the day, only I can either do my thinking or not do my thinking, but

2:17:44.480 --> 2:17:45.480
 I need to think.

2:17:45.480 --> 2:17:48.160
 But you can think all by yourself alone.

2:17:48.160 --> 2:17:49.160
 What does that mean?

2:17:49.160 --> 2:17:50.160
 All by yourself.

2:17:50.160 --> 2:17:51.160
 Right?

2:17:51.160 --> 2:17:52.160
 Can I think on a desert island?

2:17:52.160 --> 2:17:54.540
 Yes, I can think on a desert island.

2:17:54.540 --> 2:18:03.520
 Can I think as big and as broad and as deep as I can in Aristotle's Lyceum?

2:18:03.520 --> 2:18:04.520
 Of course not.

2:18:04.520 --> 2:18:09.360
 I'm a much better thinker in Aristotle's Lyceum or in any kind of situation like this

2:18:09.360 --> 2:18:13.440
 where you're going to challenge me and I have to come back and I have to think deeply about

2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:17.960
 what it is you said and why I'm not communicating very effectively and why you're not understanding

2:18:17.960 --> 2:18:18.960
 me.

2:18:18.960 --> 2:18:22.480
 Of course, now you're causing me to think much more deeply and to challenge me.

2:18:22.480 --> 2:18:24.200
 But it's still true that I have to think.

2:18:24.200 --> 2:18:28.000
 And if I don't think for myself, who's going to think for me?

2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:29.000
 Right?

2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:32.280
 So this is why I'm not a philosopher.

2:18:32.280 --> 2:18:36.440
 I'm certainly not an original thinker in that sense.

2:18:36.440 --> 2:18:40.360
 I recognize the fact that there are geniuses that are much smarter than me, whether it's

2:18:40.360 --> 2:18:43.400
 Aristotle or Ayn Rand or people that inspire me.

2:18:43.400 --> 2:18:44.680
 I study their work.

2:18:44.680 --> 2:18:46.840
 I try to understand it to the best of my ability.

2:18:46.840 --> 2:18:49.280
 But I don't take it as gospel.

2:18:49.280 --> 2:18:53.200
 I take it as this is something I need to figure out.

2:18:53.200 --> 2:18:54.240
 I need to learn it.

2:18:54.240 --> 2:18:56.720
 I need to understand it because it's good for my life.

2:18:56.720 --> 2:18:58.140
 It's important to me.

2:18:58.140 --> 2:18:59.920
 But I have to do the thinking.

2:18:59.920 --> 2:19:01.640
 It won't be mine.

2:19:01.640 --> 2:19:02.640
 It'll be Ayn Rand's.

2:19:02.640 --> 2:19:07.320
 But it won't be mine unless I've done the thinking to integrate it into my soul, into

2:19:07.320 --> 2:19:10.320
 my consciousness, into my mind.

2:19:10.320 --> 2:19:15.280
 But it's still true that I have to think for myself, not on a desert island.

2:19:15.280 --> 2:19:20.000
 I now regret ever using a desert island in the book as an example, because …

2:19:20.000 --> 2:19:21.000
 We've achieved something.

2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:22.000
 There is progress.

2:19:22.000 --> 2:19:23.000
 We're moving …

2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:24.000
 Progress towards truth is taking place.

2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:25.000
 Because clearly, it was misunderstood.

2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:26.000
 I didn't make myself clear.

2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:34.000
 I didn't make myself clear enough in the book in terms of what I meant.

2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:42.600
 But I do not advocate for thinking alone in a dark room, not engaging with reality, not

2:19:42.600 --> 2:19:46.600
 studying history, not knowing about the world, or on a desert island, not interacting with

2:19:46.600 --> 2:19:47.600
 other people.

2:19:47.600 --> 2:19:48.600
 So you're a collectivist?

2:19:48.600 --> 2:19:49.600
 No.

2:19:49.600 --> 2:19:50.600
 I'm a trader.

2:19:50.600 --> 2:19:53.360
 So I enjoy what we're doing right now because you're challenging me.

2:19:53.360 --> 2:19:55.480
 You make me a better thinker.

2:19:55.480 --> 2:19:56.880
 It's interesting.

2:19:56.880 --> 2:20:01.440
 The fact that a lot of people are going to watch this plays into it as well.

2:20:01.440 --> 2:20:04.240
 But I would probably enjoy engaging with you in conversation.

2:20:04.240 --> 2:20:05.240
 It's not even recording, so …

2:20:05.240 --> 2:20:06.240
 Yeah.

2:20:06.240 --> 2:20:07.240
 There you go.

2:20:07.240 --> 2:20:11.800
 I would enjoy engaging with you in conversation even if it wasn't being recorded, and even

2:20:11.800 --> 2:20:16.320
 if it was because that kind of conversation makes me a better … There are some people

2:20:16.320 --> 2:20:17.320
 who I wouldn't.

2:20:17.320 --> 2:20:22.920
 There are some people who make it worse, that you walk away from the conversation because

2:20:22.920 --> 2:20:23.920
 they're harmful to you.

2:20:23.920 --> 2:20:24.920
 And this is where choice comes in.

2:20:24.920 --> 2:20:28.520
 I want to be able to choose who I engage with.

2:20:28.520 --> 2:20:32.120
 I don't always have that choice because, as a public intellectual, you go in front

2:20:32.120 --> 2:20:33.120
 of audiences.

2:20:33.120 --> 2:20:36.640
 You don't always choose who it is, but you want to choose who you engage with and who

2:20:36.640 --> 2:20:37.640
 you don't.

2:20:37.640 --> 2:20:41.480
 You want to choose the forum in which you engage and how you engage.

2:20:41.480 --> 2:20:43.240
 And the standard for me is reason.

2:20:43.240 --> 2:20:44.240
 There is no other standard.

2:20:44.240 --> 2:20:46.360
 So you asked a deep question to start off.

2:20:46.360 --> 2:20:48.080
 Why reason?

2:20:48.080 --> 2:20:50.680
 Because that's where the values come from.

2:20:50.680 --> 2:20:53.440
 That's the only tool we have to discover truth.

2:20:53.440 --> 2:20:57.680
 Yes, you know, reason is something that it doesn't guarantee truth.

2:20:57.680 --> 2:21:01.120
 It doesn't guarantee the world is right, it's fallible.

2:21:01.120 --> 2:21:02.120
 But it's all we have.

2:21:02.120 --> 2:21:06.920
 It's the tool in which we evaluate the world around us and we come to conclusions about

2:21:06.920 --> 2:21:07.920
 it.

2:21:07.920 --> 2:21:09.720
 There just isn't other tools.

2:21:09.720 --> 2:21:14.800
 Emotions are not tools of cognition.

2:21:14.800 --> 2:21:16.840
 Consciousness is a tool.

2:21:16.840 --> 2:21:22.520
 Emotion like love, all of these things are ways to experience the world to say that reason

2:21:22.520 --> 2:21:23.920
 is the best tool.

2:21:23.920 --> 2:21:28.840
 But there's a difference between experiencing the world and evaluating the world in terms

2:21:28.840 --> 2:21:30.400
 of what is truth or what is not.

2:21:30.400 --> 2:21:32.880
 As a scientist, I appreciate the value of reason.

2:21:32.880 --> 2:21:36.200
 And emotions and love are consequences.

2:21:36.200 --> 2:21:38.160
 They're not primary.

2:21:38.160 --> 2:21:40.760
 Emotions are consequences of conclusions you've come to.

2:21:40.760 --> 2:21:46.600
 Your emotions will change very quickly, relatively speaking, when your evaluations of a situation

2:21:46.600 --> 2:21:47.840
 will change.

2:21:47.840 --> 2:21:51.920
 Different people can see exactly the same scene and have completely different emotions

2:21:51.920 --> 2:21:55.640
 because they're bringing different value systems and they're bringing different thoughts to

2:21:55.640 --> 2:21:56.680
 the process.

2:21:56.680 --> 2:21:57.680
 Maybe love is primary.

2:21:57.680 --> 2:21:58.680
 But let me ask.

2:21:58.680 --> 2:21:59.880
 Love is the same thing.

2:21:59.880 --> 2:22:01.240
 You can fall out of love with somebody.

2:22:01.240 --> 2:22:02.240
 Why?

2:22:02.240 --> 2:22:03.240
 Because you learn something new.

2:22:03.240 --> 2:22:05.280
 Because you've discovered something new about the person.

2:22:05.280 --> 2:22:06.280
 Now you don't love them anymore.

2:22:06.280 --> 2:22:07.680
 This is the wrong podcast to bring up love.

2:22:07.680 --> 2:22:09.720
 We'll talk forever about it.

2:22:09.720 --> 2:22:15.600
 So, Yoram, you wrote the book, The Virtue of Nationalism, contrasting nation states with

2:22:15.600 --> 2:22:19.000
 empires and with global governance like United Nations and so on.

2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:26.160
 So you argue that nationalism uniquely provides the, quote, the collective right of a free

2:22:26.160 --> 2:22:28.120
 people to rule themselves.

2:22:28.120 --> 2:22:35.680
 So continuing our conversation, why is this particular collection of humans we call a

2:22:35.680 --> 2:22:42.120
 nation a uniquely powerful way to preserve the freedom of a people, to have people rule

2:22:42.120 --> 2:22:43.120
 themselves?

2:22:43.120 --> 2:22:49.000
 Before I say anything on the subject, I should emphasize that I'm not a rationalist.

2:22:49.000 --> 2:22:58.320
 I'm an empiricist and I'm offering what I think is a valid observation of human history.

2:22:58.320 --> 2:23:03.520
 I don't have some kind of deductive framework for proving that the nation is the best.

2:23:03.520 --> 2:23:07.720
 And empirically, we know something about the way systems of national states work and about

2:23:07.720 --> 2:23:11.640
 the way empires work and the way tribal societies work.

2:23:11.640 --> 2:23:16.240
 What we don't know is, you know, is it possible to invent something else?

2:23:16.240 --> 2:23:18.760
 I mean, there's a lot of things we don't know here.

2:23:18.760 --> 2:23:25.400
 So with the caveat that I'm making an empirical observation, the basic argument is human beings

2:23:25.400 --> 2:23:32.860
 form collectives naturally, loyalty groups, and for most of human history and prehistory,

2:23:32.860 --> 2:23:36.780
 as far as we know, human beings lived in tribal societies.

2:23:36.780 --> 2:23:46.120
 Tribal societies are societies in which there's constant friction and constant warfare among

2:23:46.120 --> 2:23:50.020
 very small groups, among families and clans.

2:23:50.020 --> 2:23:55.280
 And we reach a turning point in human history with the invention of large scale agriculture,

2:23:55.280 --> 2:23:57.240
 which allows the creation of vast wealth.

2:23:57.240 --> 2:24:01.640
 It allows the establishment of standing armies instead of militias.

2:24:01.640 --> 2:24:08.400
 You know, Sargon of Akkad says, I can pay 5,000 men to do nothing other than to drill

2:24:08.400 --> 2:24:12.000
 in the arts of war and then I'm gonna send them out to conquer the neighboring city states

2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:13.920
 and there you have empire.

2:24:13.920 --> 2:24:22.000
 The Bible, which is the source of our image, our conception of a world of independent nations

2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:27.380
 that are not constantly trying to conquer one another, the source of that is the Bible.

2:24:27.380 --> 2:24:38.800
 And the biblical world is one in which Israel and various other small nations are trying

2:24:38.800 --> 2:24:46.480
 to fight for their independence against world empires, against empires Babylonian, Assyrian,

2:24:46.480 --> 2:24:51.440
 Persian, Egyptian, which aspire to rule the world.

2:24:51.440 --> 2:25:00.280
 My claim is fundamentally twofold, it's moral that whenever you conquer a foreign nation,

2:25:00.280 --> 2:25:04.000
 you're murdering and you're stealing, you're destroying.

2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:10.680
 As your own would say, you're using force to cause people to submit.

2:25:10.680 --> 2:25:18.960
 So there is something in the prophets that rebels against this ongoing atrocity and carnage

2:25:18.960 --> 2:25:23.600
 of trying to take over the whole world.

2:25:23.600 --> 2:25:30.160
 And there's a prudential practical argument, which is that the world is governed best when

2:25:30.160 --> 2:25:34.960
 there are multiple nations, when they're free to experiment and chart their own courses.

2:25:34.960 --> 2:25:41.560
 That means they have their own route to God, they have their own moralities, they have

2:25:41.560 --> 2:25:44.680
 their own forms of economy and government.

2:25:44.680 --> 2:25:49.960
 And what tends to happen in history is that when something is successful, when something

2:25:49.960 --> 2:25:54.800
 looks like, when a different nation looks at it and say, well, those people are flourishing,

2:25:54.800 --> 2:26:01.360
 they're succeeding, then it's imitated in the way that the Dutch invented the stock

2:26:01.360 --> 2:26:06.840
 market and the English said, look, that makes them powerful, so we'll adopt it.

2:26:06.840 --> 2:26:09.760
 So there's endless examples of that.

2:26:09.760 --> 2:26:10.840
 So that's the argument for it.

2:26:10.840 --> 2:26:20.320
 The argument is since we don't know a priori deductively from self evident principles what

2:26:20.320 --> 2:26:25.160
 is best, it's best to have a world in which people are trying different things.

2:26:25.160 --> 2:26:30.760
 So quick question, because the word nationalism sometimes is presented in negative light in

2:26:30.760 --> 2:26:37.040
 connection to the nationalism of Nazi Germany, for example.

2:26:37.040 --> 2:26:43.800
 So you're looking empirically at a world of nations that respect each other.

2:26:43.800 --> 2:26:49.560
 I use the word nationalism the way that I inherited it in my tradition, which is it's

2:26:49.560 --> 2:26:56.120
 a principled standpoint that says that the world is governed best when many nations are

2:26:56.120 --> 2:26:59.000
 able to be independent and chart their own course.

2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:00.000
 That's nationalism.

2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:02.780
 As far as the Nazis, Hitler's an imperialist.

2:27:02.780 --> 2:27:04.340
 He hated nation states.

2:27:04.340 --> 2:27:08.800
 His whole theory, if you pick up, I don't recommend doing this, but if you do...

2:27:08.800 --> 2:27:10.440
 I'm actually reading it right now, Mein Kampf?

2:27:10.440 --> 2:27:11.440
 Right.

2:27:11.440 --> 2:27:15.520
 If you do read Mein Kampf, then you'll see that he says explicitly that the goal is for

2:27:15.520 --> 2:27:23.040
 Germany to be the lord of the earth and mistress of the globe, and he detests the idea of the

2:27:23.040 --> 2:27:27.160
 independent nation state because he sees it as weak and defeat.

2:27:27.160 --> 2:27:28.640
 He might as well have said it's Jewish.

2:27:28.640 --> 2:27:35.440
 So let me ask from the individual perspective, for nationalism, what do you make of the value

2:27:35.440 --> 2:27:38.640
 of the love of country?

2:27:38.640 --> 2:27:45.680
 The reason I connect that... So I personally, what would you say, a patriot?

2:27:45.680 --> 2:27:48.400
 I love the love of country.

2:27:48.400 --> 2:27:56.920
 Or I am susceptible... Or how should... In a Randian way, I enjoy... I in a self interest

2:27:56.920 --> 2:27:57.920
...

2:27:57.920 --> 2:27:58.920
 That's good.

2:27:58.920 --> 2:27:59.920
 Don't run away from it.

2:27:59.920 --> 2:28:04.160
 Well, I love a lot of things, but I'm saying this particular love is a little bit contentious,

2:28:04.160 --> 2:28:06.640
 which is loving your country.

2:28:06.640 --> 2:28:11.960
 That's an interesting love that some people are a little uncomfortable with, especially

2:28:11.960 --> 2:28:18.120
 when that love... I grew up in the Soviet Union to say you just love the country.

2:28:18.120 --> 2:28:22.640
 It represents a certain thing to you, and you don't think philosophically like I was

2:28:22.640 --> 2:28:26.840
 marching around with marks under my arm or something like that.

2:28:26.840 --> 2:28:33.280
 It's just loving community at the level of nation.

2:28:33.280 --> 2:28:34.280
 It's very interesting.

2:28:34.280 --> 2:28:39.400
 I don't know if that's an artifact of the past that we're going to have to strip away.

2:28:39.400 --> 2:28:44.480
 I don't know if I was just raised in that kind of community, but I appreciate that.

2:28:44.480 --> 2:28:51.480
 I guess the thing I'm torn about is that love of country that I have in my heart that I

2:28:51.480 --> 2:28:57.000
 now love America and I consider myself an American, that would have easily, if I was

2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:03.240
 born earlier, been used by Stalin, and I would have proudly died on the battlefield.

2:29:03.240 --> 2:29:08.480
 I would have proudly died if I was in Nazi Germany as a German, and I would proudly die

2:29:08.480 --> 2:29:09.480
 as an American.

2:29:09.480 --> 2:29:11.480
 Are you sure about these things?

2:29:11.480 --> 2:29:12.480
 Yes.

2:29:12.480 --> 2:29:13.480
 That's interesting.

2:29:13.480 --> 2:29:14.800
 I think about this a lot.

2:29:14.800 --> 2:29:18.880
 It's interesting to run a radical counterfactual and be sure of the answer.

2:29:18.880 --> 2:29:19.880
 I mean...

2:29:19.880 --> 2:29:20.880
 I'm not sure.

2:29:20.880 --> 2:29:25.720
 I think about this a lot because, obviously, I'm really interested in history.

2:29:25.720 --> 2:29:29.680
 This is the way I think about most situations is I empathize.

2:29:29.680 --> 2:29:35.120
 I really try to do hard work of placing myself in that moment and thinking through it.

2:29:35.120 --> 2:29:39.800
 I'm just... Okay, I just know myself psychologically.

2:29:39.800 --> 2:29:46.080
 What I'm susceptible to, that's a negative way to phrase it, but what I would love doing.

2:29:46.080 --> 2:29:57.640
 I'm just saying, my question is, is the love of nation a useful or a powerful moral, from

2:29:57.640 --> 2:30:01.080
 a moral philosophy perspective, a good thing?

2:30:01.080 --> 2:30:04.840
 I think it is a good thing, but before we ask whether it's a good thing, I think it's

2:30:04.840 --> 2:30:08.020
 worth asking whether there's any way to live without it.

2:30:08.020 --> 2:30:14.240
 The idea of national independence of a world or a continent which politically is governed

2:30:14.240 --> 2:30:19.400
 by multiple independent national states, that is a political theory.

2:30:19.400 --> 2:30:23.880
 Somebody came up with that in the Bible or elsewhere.

2:30:23.880 --> 2:30:29.200
 Someone came up with this idea and sold it, and a lot of people like it, but the nation

2:30:29.200 --> 2:30:32.920
 is not an invention.

2:30:32.920 --> 2:30:41.640
 Every place in human history that we have any record of, there are nations.

2:30:41.640 --> 2:30:51.320
 The fact of people creating families, families creating an alliance of clans, clans creating

2:30:51.320 --> 2:31:00.440
 alliances of tribes, tribes creating an alliance that becomes the nation, we see that everywhere

2:31:00.440 --> 2:31:03.800
 in human history, everywhere we look.

2:31:03.800 --> 2:31:10.200
 The love of a group of tribes that have come together in order to fight opponents that

2:31:10.200 --> 2:31:19.000
 are trying to destroy your way of life and steal your land and harm your women and children,

2:31:19.000 --> 2:31:24.160
 the love of the leadership that brings it together.

2:31:24.160 --> 2:31:32.680
 This is a George Washington type figure or an Alfred the Great type figure or Saul, the

2:31:32.680 --> 2:31:39.520
 biblical Saul, somebody who has the wisdom, the daring to unite the tribes, overcome their

2:31:39.520 --> 2:31:48.760
 internal, mutual hatreds and grievances and rally them around a set of ideas, a language,

2:31:48.760 --> 2:31:53.920
 a tradition, an identity as people say today.

2:31:53.920 --> 2:31:57.280
 That love is irradicable from human beings.

2:31:57.280 --> 2:32:00.040
 Maybe we'll have a brave new world, people will take drugs in order to get rid of it.

2:32:00.040 --> 2:32:03.560
 The problem is that could be leveraged by authoritarian regimes.

2:32:03.560 --> 2:32:05.240
 Yes, but that's true of everything.

2:32:05.240 --> 2:32:08.960
 It's like saying you can have children and you can teach them to be evil.

2:32:08.960 --> 2:32:11.200
 You can make a lot of money, you can use it for evil.

2:32:11.200 --> 2:32:14.320
 You can have a gun for self defense, but you can use it for evil.

2:32:14.320 --> 2:32:16.240
 Come on, that's human.

2:32:16.240 --> 2:32:17.240
 That's being human.

2:32:17.240 --> 2:32:20.520
 You guys are making love this primary, which I don't think it is.

2:32:20.520 --> 2:32:22.320
 How dare you, your honor.

2:32:22.320 --> 2:32:23.320
 I know.

2:32:23.320 --> 2:32:25.680
 There are lots of people in the world out there who don't love their nation because

2:32:25.680 --> 2:32:27.520
 the nation is not worth loving.

2:32:27.520 --> 2:32:29.160
 That is love is conditional.

2:32:29.160 --> 2:32:30.520
 It's not unconditional.

2:32:30.520 --> 2:32:34.960
 Love is conditioned on the value that's presented to you.

2:32:34.960 --> 2:32:37.720
 I lived through this experience in my own life.

2:32:37.720 --> 2:32:48.120
 I grew up in Israel at a time of everything was geared towards patriotism and the state.

2:32:48.120 --> 2:32:54.960
 I would say I was trained to, when I saw a grenade, to jump on it because that was every

2:32:54.960 --> 2:33:03.320
 song and every story and everything was about the state is everything and you should sacrifice.

2:33:03.320 --> 2:33:06.840
 When the flag went up, I got teary eyed.

2:33:06.840 --> 2:33:13.400
 I bought into it completely and at some point, I rejected that and I changed and I changed

2:33:13.400 --> 2:33:16.320
 my alliance and I rejected my love of Israel.

2:33:16.320 --> 2:33:20.280
 It's not that I don't love it anymore, but it's certainly not my top love and I'm certainly

2:33:20.280 --> 2:33:25.360
 not looking for the grenade to jump on and I'm not volunteering to go fight the war there.

2:33:25.360 --> 2:33:30.240
 I fell in love from a distance with the idea of America.

2:33:30.240 --> 2:33:33.840
 I love the idea of America more than I love America.

2:33:33.840 --> 2:33:38.120
 I could see myself falling out of love with America given where it's heading.

2:33:38.120 --> 2:33:39.800
 It's not automatic.

2:33:39.800 --> 2:33:47.920
 It's conditioned on what it is that it represents and what value it represents for me.

2:33:47.920 --> 2:33:51.040
 I think that's always the case with love.

2:33:51.040 --> 2:33:55.760
 It's not true that children have to love their parents.

2:33:55.760 --> 2:34:00.520
 That's the ideal and hopefully most children love their parents, but some children fall

2:34:00.520 --> 2:34:04.960
 out of love with their parents because their parents don't deserve their love.

2:34:04.960 --> 2:34:07.320
 The same with the other way around.

2:34:07.320 --> 2:34:11.140
 I think parents are capable of not loving their children.

2:34:11.140 --> 2:34:12.720
 Love is a conditional thing.

2:34:12.720 --> 2:34:13.720
 It's not automatic.

2:34:13.720 --> 2:34:14.720
 Let me point out an agreement.

2:34:14.720 --> 2:34:15.720
 Let me say something about an agreement.

2:34:15.720 --> 2:34:18.720
 You're trying to bribe me with an agreement.

2:34:18.720 --> 2:34:25.280
 To soften the blow, mostly I like to talk to Yaron about his ideas and I don't want

2:34:25.280 --> 2:34:28.760
 to talk about Ayn Rand, but I want to say something.

2:34:28.760 --> 2:34:32.240
 Just one thing about Ayn Rand.

2:34:32.240 --> 2:34:34.800
 All my kids read Ayn Rand's books.

2:34:34.800 --> 2:34:39.280
 My father read The Fountainhead.

2:34:39.280 --> 2:34:42.920
 We know Ayn Rand.

2:34:42.920 --> 2:34:47.520
 I'll tell you it is incredibly difficult reading for me.

2:34:47.520 --> 2:34:48.520
 It's painful.

2:34:48.520 --> 2:34:49.860
 It's painful to read.

2:34:49.860 --> 2:34:51.600
 Why is it painful?

2:34:51.600 --> 2:35:00.160
 Not because I disagree with the view of trading and business and the creativity of it and

2:35:00.160 --> 2:35:01.840
 Reardon Metal.

2:35:01.840 --> 2:35:12.480
 That stuff moves me and I do admire it, but to read a book that's a thousand pages long

2:35:12.480 --> 2:35:21.040
 in which nobody is having children, nobody is having a stable marriage, no one is running

2:35:21.040 --> 2:35:29.280
 an admirable government that's fighting for a just cause, anywhere, anywhere.

2:35:29.280 --> 2:35:36.960
 I feel like it's focusing on one aspect of what it is to be human and to flourish and

2:35:36.960 --> 2:35:42.000
 that everything else is just erased and thrown out as though it's just not part of reality

2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:43.000
 and I'm scared.

2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:48.720
 I'm scared of what happens to teenagers who hormonally are in any case.

2:35:48.720 --> 2:35:55.720
 They're programmed to pull away from their parents and experiment with things.

2:35:55.720 --> 2:36:03.160
 They're biologically programmed to do that and you give them a book which says, look,

2:36:03.160 --> 2:36:04.320
 you don't have to have a family.

2:36:04.320 --> 2:36:05.440
 You don't have to raise children.

2:36:05.440 --> 2:36:06.580
 You don't have to have a country.

2:36:06.580 --> 2:36:08.300
 You don't have to fight for anything.

2:36:08.300 --> 2:36:13.080
 All you have to do is assert yourself and trade.

2:36:13.080 --> 2:36:16.320
 I think it's destructive because it's not realistic.

2:36:16.320 --> 2:36:17.320
 It's just not real.

2:36:17.320 --> 2:36:19.680
 But I got none of that from Ayn Rand.

2:36:19.680 --> 2:36:23.120
 I got none of that from Ayn Rand.

2:36:23.120 --> 2:36:24.980
 The books were not about a family.

2:36:24.980 --> 2:36:32.800
 You could write a book in Ayn Rand style where people have a family, but the goal, the purpose,

2:36:32.800 --> 2:36:33.800
 it's a novel.

2:36:33.800 --> 2:36:34.800
 It's not.

2:36:34.800 --> 2:36:37.560
 It's a novel which is delimited with a particular story.

2:36:37.560 --> 2:36:41.840
 There's one family in Gulch Gulch and there's a little passage about raising children and

2:36:41.840 --> 2:36:47.880
 the value of that because it's not core to what she is writing about, but that doesn't

2:36:47.880 --> 2:36:49.240
 exclude it.

2:36:49.240 --> 2:36:53.600
 When I read Ayn Rand, I read Atlas Shrugged when I was 16, and I read it over the years

2:36:53.600 --> 2:36:54.600
 several times more.

2:36:54.600 --> 2:36:59.320
 It never occurred to me, oh, Ayn Rand's anti family, I shouldn't have a family.

2:36:59.320 --> 2:37:01.160
 That thought never came into my mind.

2:37:01.160 --> 2:37:02.640
 I always wanted to have children.

2:37:02.640 --> 2:37:04.760
 I continue to want to have children.

2:37:04.760 --> 2:37:06.760
 I thought of it a little differently.

2:37:06.760 --> 2:37:09.360
 I thought of how I would find a partner a little bit differently.

2:37:09.360 --> 2:37:14.600
 I thought about what I would look for in a partner differently, but not that I wouldn't

2:37:14.600 --> 2:37:15.720
 want to get married.

2:37:15.720 --> 2:37:21.000
 One question I have is what effect it has on society, so outside of you.

2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:23.160
 So for example, you mentioned love should be conditional.

2:37:23.160 --> 2:37:24.160
 I think...

2:37:24.160 --> 2:37:25.160
 Well, it is.

2:37:25.160 --> 2:37:26.160
 Whether you like it or not, it is.

2:37:26.160 --> 2:37:27.880
 You might pretend that it isn't, but it's always conditional.

2:37:27.880 --> 2:37:31.500
 Well, let me try to say something and see if it makes any sense.

2:37:31.500 --> 2:37:38.440
 So could there be things that are true, like love is conditional, is always conditional,

2:37:38.440 --> 2:37:43.220
 but if you say it often, it has a negative effect on society.

2:37:43.220 --> 2:37:50.000
 So for example, I mean, so maybe I'm just a romantic, but good luck saying love is conditional

2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:52.160
 to a romantic partner.

2:37:52.160 --> 2:38:01.220
 I mean, you could, I would argue, en masse, that would deteriorate the quality of relationships.

2:38:01.220 --> 2:38:10.780
 If you remind the partner of that truth that is universal, like you have to, I mean, okay,

2:38:10.780 --> 2:38:11.780
 maybe it's just me.

2:38:11.780 --> 2:38:12.780
 I'll just speak to myself.

2:38:12.780 --> 2:38:16.020
 It's like there is a certain romantic notion of unconditional love.

2:38:16.020 --> 2:38:20.360
 It's part of why you have so many destructive marriages.

2:38:20.360 --> 2:38:21.360
 It's part of why...

2:38:21.360 --> 2:38:22.360
 So you would say that's a problem.

2:38:22.360 --> 2:38:29.480
 Yes, it's a real problem because, yes, there is a, you talked about honoring your spouse

2:38:29.480 --> 2:38:33.020
 and there's a real truth there and I respect that.

2:38:33.020 --> 2:38:35.560
 Yes, you have to do certain things.

2:38:35.560 --> 2:38:39.260
 Love is not, you marry somebody and there's a real attitude out there in the culture.

2:38:39.260 --> 2:38:42.540
 You marry somebody and okay, now we're going to, we're just going to cruise.

2:38:42.540 --> 2:38:43.540
 It's just...

2:38:43.540 --> 2:38:44.540
 Right.

2:38:44.540 --> 2:38:45.540
 Hollywood.

2:38:45.540 --> 2:38:46.540
 That's the Hollywood marriage.

2:38:46.540 --> 2:38:47.740
 You know, marriage is work.

2:38:47.740 --> 2:38:49.900
 Like all values, it's work.

2:38:49.900 --> 2:38:51.800
 It's something you have to reignite every day.

2:38:51.800 --> 2:38:59.460
 You have to, the challenges, the real disagreements, the things you fight about, you disagree

2:38:59.460 --> 2:39:07.220
 about and there's real, if it's a value, you work it out, you struggle through it.

2:39:07.220 --> 2:39:10.780
 And sometimes you struggle through it and you come to a conclusion, no, this is not

2:39:10.780 --> 2:39:16.220
 going to work and you dissolve a marriage and I'm all for dissolving after really, really

2:39:16.220 --> 2:39:20.460
 fighting for it because if it's an important value and if you fell in love with this person

2:39:20.460 --> 2:39:23.460
 for a reason, then that's something worth fighting for.

2:39:23.460 --> 2:39:27.700
 I have a feeling that Hollywood goes the other way, but it's not this cruising along and

2:39:27.700 --> 2:39:30.700
 everything is easy, no human relationship is like that.

2:39:30.700 --> 2:39:36.620
 Not friendship, not love, not raising children, not being a child.

2:39:36.620 --> 2:39:43.100
 You know, they require work and they require thinking and they require creating the conditions

2:39:43.100 --> 2:39:46.540
 to thrive and that's the sense in which it's conditional.

2:39:46.540 --> 2:39:55.560
 You have to work at it and it's very easy not to do the work and it's very easy to drift

2:39:55.560 --> 2:39:59.180
 away and I think most people don't do the work, most people take it and generally in

2:39:59.180 --> 2:40:00.180
 life.

2:40:00.180 --> 2:40:05.140
 The only place people seem to work is at work and then they take the rest of their life

2:40:05.140 --> 2:40:10.780
 as I'm going to cruise and yet every aspect of your life, the art you choose, the friends

2:40:10.780 --> 2:40:17.900
 you choose, the lovers you choose, all require real thinking and real work to be successful

2:40:17.900 --> 2:40:18.900
 at them.

2:40:18.900 --> 2:40:23.940
 None of them are just there because there is no such thing as just the intrinsic.

2:40:23.940 --> 2:40:25.820
 Right, I agree with all of that.

2:40:25.820 --> 2:40:32.940
 I was going to say before that the rabbis have this sort of shocking expression, tzargidul

2:40:32.940 --> 2:40:38.780
 banim, the pain of raising children.

2:40:38.780 --> 2:40:45.780
 And I find when I speak to audiences about relationships, I find that in general and

2:40:45.780 --> 2:40:52.220
 this is cross cultural, it's different countries, different religious backgrounds, that in general

2:40:52.220 --> 2:40:58.900
 young people do not know that the only way to make a marriage work is through a lot of

2:40:58.900 --> 2:41:00.700
 pain and overcoming.

2:41:00.700 --> 2:41:05.100
 They don't know that raising children involves a great deal of pain.

2:41:05.100 --> 2:41:11.360
 They don't know that caring for and helping your parents approach the end of their lives

2:41:11.360 --> 2:41:17.980
 causes a great deal of pain and everything is kind of this sketchy, very sketchy, glimpsy

2:41:17.980 --> 2:41:24.580
 kind of, and I mentioned Hollywood just because everything is made to look easy except there's

2:41:24.580 --> 2:41:29.340
 kind of a funny breakdown of something but then maybe there's a divorce, they shoot

2:41:29.340 --> 2:41:32.500
 one another so then they should get divorced.

2:41:32.500 --> 2:41:42.860
 But the reality of how hard it is to do and how heroic it is to do it and then overcome

2:41:42.860 --> 2:41:51.460
 and then actually in the end achieve something, create something that was really, it's almost

2:41:51.460 --> 2:41:58.900
 not discussed and so to me it's just not surprising that if there's no parallel to

2:41:58.900 --> 2:42:05.060
 Ayn Rand about the heroic saving of a marriage that was on the rocks, how does it actually

2:42:05.060 --> 2:42:06.060
 happen?

2:42:06.060 --> 2:42:07.060
 So…

2:42:07.060 --> 2:42:12.020
 So it's a good point you're making but something just came to me that I've never

2:42:12.020 --> 2:42:14.060
 thought of before so that's always good.

2:42:14.060 --> 2:42:16.540
 This is where conversation is good.

2:42:16.540 --> 2:42:22.540
 Look, take the Talmud and I can't remember how many years after the Bible the Talmud

2:42:22.540 --> 2:42:27.300
 is written, over how long of a period it's written, how many people participating in

2:42:27.300 --> 2:42:28.300
 writing it.

2:42:28.300 --> 2:42:30.540
 Ayn Rand was one individual.

2:42:30.540 --> 2:42:36.580
 She wrote a series of books on philosophy which I think are true but they're the beginning.

2:42:36.580 --> 2:42:40.020
 There is a lot of work to be done to apply this.

2:42:40.020 --> 2:42:45.820
 So hopefully there will be one of her students who writes a book on relationships and there'll

2:42:45.820 --> 2:42:51.500
 be somebody who writes a book on developing a political theory in greater detail and develop

2:42:51.500 --> 2:42:52.500
 her ethics.

2:42:52.500 --> 2:42:57.660
 She's got a few writings on ethics and it's in the novels but there's a lot of work

2:42:57.660 --> 2:43:00.900
 to be done, fleshing it out, what does it mean, how do you…

2:43:00.900 --> 2:43:04.940
 So to say Ayn Rand didn't do everything is a truism.

2:43:04.940 --> 2:43:05.940
 She didn't do everything.

2:43:05.940 --> 2:43:07.260
 Okay, so what?

2:43:07.260 --> 2:43:13.020
 But she laid this amazing philosophical foundation that allows us to take those principles and

2:43:13.020 --> 2:43:18.580
 to apply them to all these realms of human life and she does it on a scope that few philosophers

2:43:18.580 --> 2:43:22.780
 in human history have done because she goes from metaphysics all the way to aesthetics,

2:43:22.780 --> 2:43:26.860
 hitting the key, and she's an original thinker on each one of those things.

2:43:26.860 --> 2:43:31.600
 And she might be right, she might be wrong on certain aspects of it, always happy to

2:43:31.600 --> 2:43:35.820
 have a debate about where she's wrong or where she's not, but there's a lot of

2:43:35.820 --> 2:43:37.500
 work to be done, right?

2:43:37.500 --> 2:43:42.620
 It's not like – and if there were objectivists out there who present it as, okay, human knowledge

2:43:42.620 --> 2:43:45.740
 is over because Ayn Rand wrote these books, that's absurd, right?

2:43:45.740 --> 2:43:50.700
 This huge amount of work to be done in applying these particular ideas just like there was

2:43:50.700 --> 2:43:56.460
 for any philosophy, take these ideas and now apply them to all these realms in human experience

2:43:56.460 --> 2:44:00.420
 that flesh it out and make it – and one of the reasons I don't think objectivism

2:44:00.420 --> 2:44:05.180
 is taken off is because there's all this work still to be done that allows it to be

2:44:05.180 --> 2:44:08.380
 relatable to people in every aspect of them.

2:44:08.380 --> 2:44:10.260
 Let me ask a hard question here.

2:44:10.260 --> 2:44:11.260
 We've got –

2:44:11.260 --> 2:44:12.940
 Can I say what I agreed with you, Omar?

2:44:12.940 --> 2:44:13.940
 Sure, sure.

2:44:13.940 --> 2:44:14.940
 This is good.

2:44:14.940 --> 2:44:15.940
 This will be a good transition.

2:44:15.940 --> 2:44:17.620
 Here, this is the clip.

2:44:17.620 --> 2:44:19.460
 This is the clip.

2:44:19.460 --> 2:44:20.860
 I agree about nations.

2:44:20.860 --> 2:44:25.980
 So I don't like the term nationalism because I fear what happens when you put an ism at

2:44:25.980 --> 2:44:27.620
 the end of any word.

2:44:27.620 --> 2:44:28.740
 Anything, yes.

2:44:28.740 --> 2:44:32.420
 But the nation is a good thing.

2:44:32.420 --> 2:44:35.620
 And having a diversity of nations in a sense is a good thing.

2:44:35.620 --> 2:44:42.540
 And in this sense, I don't think one can come up – so look, I said and I hold that

2:44:42.540 --> 2:44:46.740
 the ideal nation is a nation that protects individual rights.

2:44:46.740 --> 2:44:48.380
 How do you do that?

2:44:48.380 --> 2:44:49.420
 What are the details?

2:44:49.420 --> 2:44:52.380
 How do we define property rights exactly in an internet world?

2:44:52.380 --> 2:44:56.140
 There's going to be disagreement, rational, reasonable disagreement.

2:44:56.140 --> 2:45:02.460
 They're going to be – in my future, in the 300 years from now, in my ideas of one

2:45:02.460 --> 2:45:06.500
 finally, right, there will be multiple nations trying to apply the principle of applying

2:45:06.500 --> 2:45:09.620
 individual rights, and they'll do it differently.

2:45:09.620 --> 2:45:13.820
 One of the benefits of federalism is that while you have a national government, there

2:45:13.820 --> 2:45:19.100
 are certain issues that you relegate to states, and they can try different things and learn

2:45:19.100 --> 2:45:23.460
 because there is a huge value in empirical knowledge comes there.

2:45:23.460 --> 2:45:26.120
 You can't just deduce it all and figure it all out.

2:45:26.120 --> 2:45:27.560
 You have to experiment.

2:45:27.560 --> 2:45:34.560
 So I do – I hate the idea of a one world government because experimentation is gone,

2:45:34.560 --> 2:45:37.300
 and if you make a mistake, everybody suffers.

2:45:37.300 --> 2:45:42.140
 I like the idea, and then I like the idea of people being able to choose where they

2:45:42.140 --> 2:45:43.140
 live.

2:45:43.140 --> 2:45:50.380
 But this notion of experimentation I think is crucial, but you need a principle.

2:45:50.380 --> 2:45:54.940
 So I don't like the idea of nations if all the nations are going to be bad, right?

2:45:54.940 --> 2:45:58.140
 If all the nations are going to be horrible, then I don't like it.

2:45:58.140 --> 2:46:04.620
 What I like is a variety of nations all practicing basically good ideas, and then we try to

2:46:04.620 --> 2:46:09.020
 figure out, okay, what works better than other things, and what is sustainable and what is

2:46:09.020 --> 2:46:10.020
 not.

2:46:10.020 --> 2:46:15.660
 Given how many difficult aspects of history and society we talked about, let me ask a

2:46:15.660 --> 2:46:17.660
 hard question of both of you.

2:46:17.660 --> 2:46:22.020
 I'm going to breeze up until now.

2:46:22.020 --> 2:46:25.420
 What gives you hope about the future?

2:46:25.420 --> 2:46:31.700
 So we've been describing reasons to maybe not have hope.

2:46:31.700 --> 2:46:33.100
 What gives you hope?

2:46:33.100 --> 2:46:39.060
 When you look at the world, what gives you hope that in 200 years, in 300 years, in 500

2:46:39.060 --> 2:46:45.820
 years, like the founders look into the future, that human civilization will be all right,

2:46:45.820 --> 2:46:47.860
 and more than that, it will flourish?

2:46:47.860 --> 2:46:49.700
 Two things for me.

2:46:49.700 --> 2:46:50.900
 One is history.

2:46:50.900 --> 2:46:54.740
 So in the very long run, good ideas win out.

2:46:54.740 --> 2:47:03.140
 I think in the very long run, you can go through a dark ages, but you come out of a dark ages.

2:47:03.140 --> 2:47:08.860
 The good and the just does win in the end, even if it is bloody and difficult and hard

2:47:08.860 --> 2:47:10.000
 to get there.

2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:14.800
 So while I am quite pessimistic, unfortunately, about the short run, I'm ultimately optimistic

2:47:14.800 --> 2:47:19.580
 that in the long run, good ideas win and they're justified.

2:47:19.580 --> 2:47:26.740
 And I think the fundamental behind that is I think is that I'm fundamentally positive

2:47:26.740 --> 2:47:27.980
 about human nature.

2:47:27.980 --> 2:47:35.380
 I think human beings can think, they're capable of reasoning, they're capable of figuring

2:47:35.380 --> 2:47:38.620
 out the truth, they're capable of learning from experience.

2:47:38.620 --> 2:47:40.140
 They don't always do it.

2:47:40.140 --> 2:47:45.580
 It's an achievement to do it, but over time, they do.

2:47:45.580 --> 2:47:50.220
 If you create the right circumstances, they will, and when things get bad enough, they

2:47:50.220 --> 2:47:52.060
 look for a way out.

2:47:52.060 --> 2:47:57.940
 They look maybe at history, if the history is available to them, maybe at just learning

2:47:57.940 --> 2:48:05.020
 from what's around them to find better ways of doing things, and that reinforces itself.

2:48:05.020 --> 2:48:10.180
 But human beings are an amazing creature.

2:48:10.180 --> 2:48:14.660
 We're just amazing in our capacity to be creative, in our capacity to think, in our capacity

2:48:14.660 --> 2:48:19.020
 to love, in our capacity to change our environment to fit our needs and to fit our requirements

2:48:19.020 --> 2:48:26.700
 for survival and to learn and to grow and to progress.

2:48:26.700 --> 2:48:29.540
 So again, long term, I think all that wins out.

2:48:29.540 --> 2:48:36.700
 Short term, in any point in history, short term, right now, it doesn't look too good.

2:48:36.700 --> 2:48:48.860
 What about you, Yaron?

2:48:48.860 --> 2:48:58.900
 The source for Yaron's hope is the book of Exodus, which is the first place in human

2:48:58.900 --> 2:49:07.220
 history where we are presented with the possibility that an enslaved people that's being persecuted

2:49:07.220 --> 2:49:14.500
 and murdered and living under the worst possible regime can free itself and have a shot at

2:49:14.500 --> 2:49:24.220
 a life of independence and worth, and it's another inherited Jewish idea in the tradition.

2:49:24.220 --> 2:49:32.140
 The way that we express this is by saying that there is a God who judges.

2:49:32.140 --> 2:49:38.460
 The Israelis in Egypt were enslaved for hundreds of years, according to the Exodus story, hundreds

2:49:38.460 --> 2:49:42.420
 of years before God wakes up and hears them.

2:49:42.420 --> 2:49:51.340
 And he doesn't do anything until Moses kills the oppressor and goes out into the desert.

2:49:51.340 --> 2:49:59.820
 So I think it's pretty realistic that there is a God that God judges and acts, but probably

2:49:59.820 --> 2:50:05.340
 often not for a very, very long time and not until there's a human being who gets up and

2:50:05.340 --> 2:50:06.780
 says enough.

2:50:06.780 --> 2:50:09.320
 I know that today people don't want to read the Bible.

2:50:09.320 --> 2:50:11.240
 They don't like reading the Bible.

2:50:11.240 --> 2:50:21.740
 But I always hear in my ear this cry of the prophet Jeremiah who saw his nation destroyed

2:50:21.740 --> 2:50:24.580
 and his people exiled.

2:50:24.580 --> 2:50:33.220
 And he says, in God's name, he says, he's not my word like fire, like the hammer that

2:50:33.220 --> 2:50:38.140
 shatters rock, a petition, a petzela.

2:50:38.140 --> 2:50:41.900
 My word is like fire, like the hammer that shatters rock.

2:50:41.900 --> 2:50:46.060
 And this is actually the traditional way of saying something like what Yaron is saying

2:50:46.060 --> 2:50:53.100
 that it may take a long, long time, but there is a truth and it has its own strength and

2:50:53.100 --> 2:50:59.600
 it will, in the end, shatter the things that are opposing it.

2:50:59.600 --> 2:51:01.380
 That's our traditional hope.

2:51:01.380 --> 2:51:05.980
 We grow up like that.

2:51:05.980 --> 2:51:07.780
 So I do have hope.

2:51:07.780 --> 2:51:08.780
 I see the trends.

2:51:08.780 --> 2:51:16.220
 The trends are terrible right now and it's frightening and it's hard, but we are terrible

2:51:16.220 --> 2:51:17.460
 at seeing the future.

2:51:17.460 --> 2:51:25.300
 And it is very possible that an unexpected turn of events is going to appear maybe soon,

2:51:25.300 --> 2:51:33.680
 maybe much later, and the possibility of a redemption is there.

2:51:33.680 --> 2:51:40.900
 Let me ask, given that long arc of history, given that you do study the Bible, what is

2:51:40.900 --> 2:51:42.780
 the meaning of this whole thing?

2:51:42.780 --> 2:51:44.180
 What's the meaning of life?

2:51:44.180 --> 2:51:46.300
 Wow, that's beautiful.

2:51:46.300 --> 2:51:59.060
 I think that the meaning of life is in part what Yaron touches on when he says that productive

2:51:59.060 --> 2:52:03.380
 work, labor, creativity is at the heart of what it is to be human.

2:52:03.380 --> 2:52:12.540
 I just think that there are some more arenas and maybe we even agree on a lot of them.

2:52:12.540 --> 2:52:20.700
 To be human is to inherit a world which is imperfect, terribly imperfect, imperfect in

2:52:20.700 --> 2:52:23.860
 many ways.

2:52:23.860 --> 2:52:26.960
 And God created it that way.

2:52:26.960 --> 2:52:34.220
 He created a world which is terribly lacking and he created us with the ability to stand

2:52:34.220 --> 2:52:38.620
 up and to say, I can change the direction of this.

2:52:38.620 --> 2:52:41.020
 I can do something to change the direction of this.

2:52:41.020 --> 2:52:46.100
 I can take the time and the abilities that are given to me to be a partner with God in

2:52:46.100 --> 2:52:47.500
 creating the world.

2:52:47.500 --> 2:52:50.660
 It's not going to stay the way it was before me.

2:52:50.660 --> 2:52:56.560
 It'll be something different, maybe a little bit, maybe a lot.

2:52:56.560 --> 2:52:59.340
 But that is the heart.

2:52:59.340 --> 2:53:00.340
 That is the key.

2:53:00.340 --> 2:53:06.140
 That is the meaningful life is to be a partner with God in creating the world so that it

2:53:06.140 --> 2:53:12.180
 is moving that much more in the right direction rather than the way we found it.

2:53:12.180 --> 2:53:16.540
 So nudge, even if a little bit, the direction of the world.

2:53:16.540 --> 2:53:24.860
 Well, Yaron, you've actually been talking in your program about life quite a bit.

2:53:24.860 --> 2:53:32.620
 So let me ask the same question and I never tire you of asking this question.

2:53:32.620 --> 2:53:34.900
 What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

2:53:34.900 --> 2:53:41.260
 Well, I mean, I don't believe in God, so God doesn't play a role in my view of the meaning

2:53:41.260 --> 2:53:42.260
 of life.

2:53:42.260 --> 2:53:44.780
 I think the meaning of life is to live.

2:53:44.780 --> 2:53:52.100
 I like to say to live with a capital L. It's to embrace it and I agree with you on in a

2:53:52.100 --> 2:53:57.580
 sense we're born into a world and as human beings, one of the things that makes us very

2:53:57.580 --> 2:54:01.340
 different than other animals is our capacity to change that world.

2:54:01.340 --> 2:54:04.140
 We can actually go out there and change the world around us.

2:54:04.140 --> 2:54:09.660
 We can change it materially through production and through, we can change it spiritually

2:54:09.660 --> 2:54:12.300
 through changing the ideas of people.

2:54:12.300 --> 2:54:17.260
 We can change the direction to which humanity works.

2:54:17.260 --> 2:54:20.060
 We can create a little universe.

2:54:20.060 --> 2:54:23.780
 I think part of the joy of creating a family is to create a little universe.

2:54:23.780 --> 2:54:29.020
 We're creating a little world around us that's part of the joy.

2:54:29.020 --> 2:54:32.820
 And there is joy in family, let's not make it all about difficulty and hard work.

2:54:32.820 --> 2:54:33.820
 I agree.

2:54:33.820 --> 2:54:34.820
 I agree.

2:54:34.820 --> 2:54:39.580
 Part of the idea of getting married is to create a little world in which you and your

2:54:39.580 --> 2:54:45.180
 spouse are creating something that didn't exist before and building something, building

2:54:45.180 --> 2:54:46.180
 a universe.

2:54:46.180 --> 2:54:47.180
 But it's really to live.

2:54:47.180 --> 2:54:55.140
 And one of the things that I see and it saddens me is wasted lives, is people who just cruise

2:54:55.140 --> 2:54:56.140
 through life.

2:54:56.140 --> 2:55:01.860
 They get born in a particular place, they never challenge it, they never question.

2:55:01.860 --> 2:55:05.860
 They just, you know, they live, die and nothing really happened.

2:55:05.860 --> 2:55:06.860
 Nothing really changed.

2:55:06.860 --> 2:55:09.060
 They didn't produce, they didn't make anything of their life.

2:55:09.060 --> 2:55:12.700
 And produce here, again, in the largest sense.

2:55:12.700 --> 2:55:17.100
 So to me it's, in every aspect of life, as you know because you've listened to my show,

2:55:17.100 --> 2:55:22.020
 I love art, I love aesthetics, I love the experience of great art.

2:55:22.020 --> 2:55:31.060
 I love relationships, I love producing, I like business, I like that aspect of it.

2:55:31.060 --> 2:55:38.340
 And I think people are shallow in so many parts of their lives, which saddens me.

2:55:38.340 --> 2:55:42.940
 If you had eight billion people on this planet, even if it never grew, even if we just stayed

2:55:42.940 --> 2:55:47.580
 at eight billion, but the eight billion all lived fully, wow.

2:55:47.580 --> 2:55:52.620
 I mean, what an amazing place this would be, what an amazing experience we would have.

2:55:52.620 --> 2:55:57.140
 So to me that is, the meaning is just make the most that you have a short period of time

2:55:57.140 --> 2:55:58.980
 on earth.

2:55:58.980 --> 2:55:59.980
 And that's it.

2:55:59.980 --> 2:56:00.980
 This is it.

2:56:00.980 --> 2:56:05.060
 And live it, experience it fully and challenge yourself and push yourself.

2:56:05.060 --> 2:56:08.260
 And let me just say something about optimism.

2:56:08.260 --> 2:56:13.020
 One source of hope for me in the world in which we live right now is that there are

2:56:13.020 --> 2:56:18.020
 people who do that, at least in certain realms of their lives.

2:56:18.020 --> 2:56:23.220
 And I'm inspired, and I know a lot of people don't like me for this, but I'm inspired for

2:56:23.220 --> 2:56:26.820
 example by Silicon Valley, in spite of all the political disagreements I have with them

2:56:26.820 --> 2:56:27.820
 and all of that.

2:56:27.820 --> 2:56:33.060
 I'm inspired by people inventing new technologies and building, I'm inspired by the people you

2:56:33.060 --> 2:56:38.020
 talk to about artificial intelligence and about new ideas and about pushing the boundaries

2:56:38.020 --> 2:56:39.260
 of science.

2:56:39.260 --> 2:56:43.460
 Those things are exciting and it's terrific to see a world that I think generally is in

2:56:43.460 --> 2:56:44.460
 decline.

2:56:44.460 --> 2:56:50.260
 Yet there are these pockets in which people are still creating new ventures and new ideas

2:56:50.260 --> 2:56:52.420
 and new things.

2:56:52.420 --> 2:56:56.620
 That inspires me and it gives me hope that that is not dead, that in spite of the decay

2:56:56.620 --> 2:57:02.180
 that's in our culture, there's still pockets where that spirit of being human is still

2:57:02.180 --> 2:57:03.180
 alive and well.

2:57:03.180 --> 2:57:05.220
 Yeah, they inspire me as well.

2:57:05.220 --> 2:57:12.260
 Yeah, and they truly live with a capital L, and maybe I can do a star, maybe you can also

2:57:12.260 --> 2:57:17.140
 put a little bit of love with a capital L out there as well.

2:57:17.140 --> 2:57:21.220
 Yaron, you knew I would end it that way, wouldn't you?

2:57:21.220 --> 2:57:23.780
 Yaron, thank you so much, this is a huge honor.

2:57:23.780 --> 2:57:28.260
 I really enjoyed the debate yesterday, I really enjoyed the conversation today that you spent

2:57:28.260 --> 2:57:30.580
 your valuable time with me, it just means a lot.

2:57:30.580 --> 2:57:33.420
 Thank you so much, this was amazing.

2:57:33.420 --> 2:57:37.500
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Yaron Brook and Yaron Hosoni.

2:57:37.500 --> 2:57:42.180
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:57:42.180 --> 2:57:46.420
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Edmund Burke.

2:57:46.420 --> 2:57:53.220
 The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.

2:57:53.220 --> 2:58:04.900
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
