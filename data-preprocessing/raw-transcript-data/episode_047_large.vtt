00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
 The following is a conversation with Sean Carroll, Part 2, the second time we've spoken

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
 on the podcast.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.320
 You can get the link to the first time in the description.

00:10.320 --> 00:15.360
 This time we focus on quantum mechanics and the many worlds interpretation that he details

00:15.360 --> 00:19.200
 elegantly in his new book titled Something Deeply Hidden.

00:19.200 --> 00:24.520
 I own and enjoy both the eBook and audiobook versions of it.

00:24.520 --> 00:29.400
 Listening to Sean read about entanglement, complementarity, and the emergence of space

00:29.400 --> 00:35.600
 time reminds me of Bob Ross teaching the world how to paint on his old television show.

00:35.600 --> 00:39.580
 If you don't know who Bob Ross is, you're truly missing out.

00:39.580 --> 00:40.580
 Look him up.

00:40.580 --> 00:42.960
 He'll make you fall in love with painting.

00:42.960 --> 00:48.320
 Sean Carroll is the Bob Ross of theoretical physics.

00:48.320 --> 00:53.520
 He's the author of several popular books, a host of a great podcast called Mindscape,

00:53.520 --> 00:59.440
 and is a theoretical physicist at Caltech and the Santa Fe Institute, specializing in

00:59.440 --> 01:04.280
 quantum mechanics, arrow of time, cosmology, and gravitation.

01:04.280 --> 01:07.020
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:18.560 --> 01:23.680
 And now here's my conversation with Sean Carroll.

01:23.680 --> 01:28.400
 Isaac Newton developed what we now call classical mechanics that you describe very nicely in

01:28.400 --> 01:32.500
 your new book, as you do with a lot of basic concepts in physics.

01:32.500 --> 01:39.040
 So with classical mechanics, I can throw a rock and can predict the trajectory of that

01:39.040 --> 01:41.080
 rock's flight.

01:41.080 --> 01:47.340
 But if we could put ourselves back into Newton's time, his theories work to predict things,

01:47.340 --> 01:52.480
 but as I understand, he himself thought that they were, their interpretations of those

01:52.480 --> 01:56.120
 predictions were absurd.

01:56.120 --> 02:01.560
 Perhaps he just said it for religious reasons and so on, but in particular, sort of a world

02:01.560 --> 02:05.580
 of interaction without contact, so action at a distance.

02:05.580 --> 02:09.860
 It didn't make sense to him on a sort of a human interpretation level.

02:09.860 --> 02:16.480
 Does it make sense to you that things can affect other things at a distance?

02:16.480 --> 02:20.140
 It does, but that was one of Newton's worries.

02:20.140 --> 02:24.800
 You're actually right in a slightly different way about the religious worries.

02:24.800 --> 02:29.680
 He was smart enough, this is off the topic but still fascinating, Newton almost invented

02:29.680 --> 02:33.120
 chaos theory as soon as he invented classical mechanics.

02:33.120 --> 02:37.600
 He realized that in the solar system, so he was able to explain how planets move around

02:37.600 --> 02:43.100
 the Sun, but typically you would describe the orbit of the Earth ignoring the effects

02:43.100 --> 02:46.400
 of Jupiter and Saturn and so forth, just doing the Earth and the Sun.

02:46.400 --> 02:50.640
 He kind of knew, even though he couldn't do the math, that if you included the effects

02:50.640 --> 02:54.560
 of Jupiter and Saturn and the other planets, the solar system would be unstable, like the

02:54.560 --> 02:57.120
 orbits of the planets would get out of whack.

02:57.120 --> 03:01.160
 So he thought that God would intervene occasionally to sort of move the planets back into orbit,

03:01.160 --> 03:05.560
 which is the only way you could explain how they were there presumably forever.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.540
 But the worries about classical mechanics were a little bit different, the worry about

03:08.540 --> 03:09.540
 gravity in particular.

03:09.540 --> 03:12.960
 It wasn't a worry about classical mechanics, it was a worry about gravity.

03:12.960 --> 03:16.720
 How in the world does the Earth know that there's something called the Sun, 93 million

03:16.720 --> 03:20.240
 miles away, that is exerting gravitational force on it?

03:20.240 --> 03:24.760
 And he literally said, you know, I leave that for future generations to think about because

03:24.760 --> 03:26.720
 I don't know what the answer is.

03:26.720 --> 03:31.520
 And in fact, people under emphasized this, but future generations figured it out.

03:31.520 --> 03:38.100
 Pierre Simone Laplace in circa 1800 showed that you could rewrite Newtonian gravity as

03:38.100 --> 03:39.480
 a field theory.

03:39.480 --> 03:43.640
 So instead of just talking about the force due to gravity, you can talk about the gravitational

03:43.640 --> 03:48.280
 field or the gravitational potential field, and then there's no action at a distance.

03:48.280 --> 03:52.260
 It's exactly the same theory empirically, it makes exactly the same predictions.

03:52.260 --> 03:55.880
 But what's happening is instead of the Sun just reaching out across the void, there is

03:55.880 --> 04:01.880
 a gravitational field in between the Sun and the Earth that obeys an equation, Laplace's

04:01.880 --> 04:05.700
 equation, cleverly enough, and that tells us exactly what the field does.

04:05.700 --> 04:09.900
 So even in Newtonian gravity, you don't need action at a distance.

04:09.900 --> 04:13.880
 Now what many people say is that Einstein solved this problem because he invented general

04:13.880 --> 04:14.880
 relativity.

04:14.880 --> 04:19.380
 And in general relativity, there's certainly a field in between the Earth and the Sun.

04:19.380 --> 04:21.720
 But also there's the speed of light as a limit.

04:21.720 --> 04:26.720
 In Laplace's theory, which was exactly Newton's theory, just in a different mathematical language,

04:26.720 --> 04:31.300
 there could still be instantaneous action across the universe, whereas in general relativity,

04:31.300 --> 04:36.000
 if you shake something here, its gravitational impulse radiates out at the speed of light

04:36.000 --> 04:39.340
 and we call that a gravitational wave and we can detect those.

04:39.340 --> 04:45.280
 So but I really, it rubs me the wrong way to think that we should presume the answer

04:45.280 --> 04:47.160
 should look one way or the other.

04:47.160 --> 04:51.800
 Like if it turned out that there was action at a distance in physics and that was the

04:51.800 --> 04:54.640
 best way to describe things, then I would do it that way.

04:54.640 --> 04:58.920
 It's actually a very deep question because when we don't know what the right laws of

04:58.920 --> 05:03.040
 physics are, when we're guessing at them, when we're hypothesizing at what they might

05:03.040 --> 05:07.160
 be, we are often guided by our intuitions about what they should be.

05:07.160 --> 05:11.840
 I mean, Einstein famously was very guided by his intuitions and he did not like the

05:11.840 --> 05:15.760
 idea of action at a distance.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.120
 We don't know whether he was right or not.

05:17.120 --> 05:21.800
 It depends on your interpretation of quantum mechanics and it depends on even how you talk

05:21.800 --> 05:24.040
 about quantum mechanics within any one interpretation.

05:24.040 --> 05:32.200
 So if you see every force as a field or any other interpretation of action at a distance,

05:32.200 --> 05:40.800
 just stepping back to sort of caveman thinking, like do you really, can you really sort of

05:40.800 --> 05:45.520
 understand what it means for a force to be a field that's everywhere?

05:45.520 --> 05:47.880
 So if you look at gravity, like what do you think about?

05:47.880 --> 05:48.880
 I think so.

05:48.880 --> 05:58.240
 Is this something that you've been conditioned by society to think that, to map the fact

05:58.240 --> 06:04.380
 that science is extremely well predictive of something to believing that you actually

06:04.380 --> 06:06.120
 understand it?

06:06.120 --> 06:12.080
 Like you can intuitively, the degree that human beings can understand anything that

06:12.080 --> 06:13.080
 you actually understand it.

06:13.080 --> 06:19.240
 Or are you just trusting the beauty and the power of the predictive power of science?

06:19.240 --> 06:25.000
 That depends on what you mean by this idea of truly understanding something, right?

06:25.000 --> 06:29.360
 You know, I mean, can I truly understand Fermat's last theorem?

06:29.360 --> 06:34.680
 You know, it's easy to state it, but do I really appreciate what it means for incredibly

06:34.680 --> 06:37.440
 large numbers, right?

06:37.440 --> 06:41.680
 I think yes, I think I do understand it, but like if you want to just push people on well,

06:41.680 --> 06:46.440
 but your intuition doesn't go to the places where Andrew Wiles needed to go to prove Fermat's

06:46.440 --> 06:50.120
 last theorem, then I can say fine, but I still think I understand the theorem.

06:50.120 --> 06:56.200
 And likewise, I think that I do have a pretty good intuitive understanding of fields pervading

06:56.200 --> 07:00.640
 space time, whether it's the gravitational field or the electromagnetic field or whatever,

07:00.640 --> 07:03.000
 the Higgs field.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.080
 Of course, one's intuition gets worse and worse as you get trickier in the quantum field

07:08.080 --> 07:12.960
 theory and all sorts of new phenomena that come up in quantum field theory.

07:12.960 --> 07:17.080
 So our intuitions aren't perfect, but I think it's also okay to say that our intuitions

07:17.080 --> 07:18.080
 get trained, right?

07:18.080 --> 07:21.340
 Like, you know, I have different intuitions now than I had when I was a baby.

07:21.340 --> 07:22.340
 That's okay.

07:22.340 --> 07:26.000
 That's not, an intuition is not necessarily intrinsic to who we are.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.400
 We can train it a little bit.

07:27.400 --> 07:33.080
 So that's where I'm going to bring in Noam Chomsky for a second, who thinks that our

07:33.080 --> 07:40.320
 cognitive abilities are sort of evolved through time, and so they're biologically constrained.

07:40.320 --> 07:45.520
 And so there's a clear limit, as he puts it, to our cognitive abilities, and it's a very

07:45.520 --> 07:47.280
 harsh limit.

07:47.280 --> 07:52.520
 But you actually kind of said something interesting in nature versus nurture thing here, is we

07:52.520 --> 07:58.200
 can train our intuitions to sort of build up the cognitive muscles to be able to understand

07:58.200 --> 07:59.400
 some of these tricky concepts.

07:59.400 --> 08:07.320
 So do you think there's limits to our understanding that's deeply rooted, hardcoded into our biology

08:07.320 --> 08:09.960
 that we can't overcome?

08:09.960 --> 08:15.840
 There could be limits to things like our ability to visualize, okay?

08:15.840 --> 08:20.200
 But when someone like Ed Witten proves a theorem about, you know, 100 dimensional mathematical

08:20.200 --> 08:22.640
 spaces, he's not visualizing it.

08:22.640 --> 08:23.640
 He's doing the math.

08:23.640 --> 08:27.600
 That doesn't stop him from understanding the result.

08:27.600 --> 08:32.480
 I think, and I would love to understand this better, but my rough feeling, which is not

08:32.480 --> 08:37.800
 very educated, is that, you know, there's some threshold that one crosses in abstraction

08:37.800 --> 08:41.520
 when one becomes kind of like a Turing machine, right?

08:41.520 --> 08:48.440
 One has the ability to contain in one's brain logical, formal, symbolic structures and manipulate

08:48.440 --> 08:49.440
 them.

08:49.440 --> 08:55.240
 And that's a leap that we can make as human beings that dogs and cats haven't made.

08:55.240 --> 09:00.440
 And once you get there, I'm not sure that there are any limits to our ability to understand

09:00.440 --> 09:02.320
 the scientific world at all.

09:02.320 --> 09:03.320
 Maybe there are.

09:03.320 --> 09:07.080
 There's certainly limits in our ability to calculate things, right?

09:07.080 --> 09:10.880
 You know, people are not very good at taking cube roots of million digit numbers in their

09:10.880 --> 09:11.880
 head.

09:11.880 --> 09:14.320
 But that's not an element of understanding.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.880
 It's certainly not a limit in principle.

09:15.880 --> 09:21.680
 So of course, as a human, you would say there doesn't feel to be limits to our understanding.

09:21.680 --> 09:30.240
 But sort of, have you thought that the universe is actually a lot simpler than it appears

09:30.240 --> 09:31.240
 to us?

09:31.240 --> 09:36.200
 And we just will never be able to, like, it's outside of our, okay.

09:36.200 --> 09:43.240
 So us, our cognitive abilities combined with our mathematical prowess and whatever kind

09:43.240 --> 09:50.760
 of experimental simulation devices we can put together, is there limits to that?

09:50.760 --> 09:52.960
 Is it possible there's limits to that?

09:52.960 --> 09:57.260
 Well, of course it's possible that there are limits to that.

09:57.260 --> 10:02.880
 Is there any good reason to think that we're anywhere close to the limits is a harder question.

10:02.880 --> 10:07.240
 Look, imagine asking this question 500 years ago to the world's greatest thinkers, right?

10:07.240 --> 10:12.320
 Like are we approaching the limits of our ability to understand the natural world?

10:12.320 --> 10:17.180
 And by definition, there are questions about the natural world that are most interesting

10:17.180 --> 10:19.840
 to us that are the ones we don't quite yet understand, right?

10:19.840 --> 10:23.280
 So there's always, we're always faced with these puzzles we don't yet know.

10:23.280 --> 10:26.140
 And I don't know what they would have said 500 years ago, but they didn't even know about

10:26.140 --> 10:28.800
 classical mechanics, much less quantum mechanics.

10:28.800 --> 10:33.560
 So we know that they were nowhere close to how well they could do, right?

10:33.560 --> 10:36.160
 They could do enormously better than they were doing at the time.

10:36.160 --> 10:39.240
 I see no reason why the same thing isn't true for us today.

10:39.240 --> 10:44.560
 So of all the worries that keep me awake at night, the human mind's inability to rationally

10:44.560 --> 10:47.560
 comprehend the world is low on the list.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.880
 Well put.

10:49.880 --> 10:54.320
 So one interesting philosophical point that quantum mechanics bring up is the, that you

10:54.320 --> 11:02.040
 talk about the distinction between the world as it is and the world as we observe it.

11:02.040 --> 11:08.200
 So staying at the human level for a second, how big is the gap between what our perception

11:08.200 --> 11:15.720
 system allows us to see and the world as it is outside our mind's eye sort of, sort of

11:15.720 --> 11:21.720
 not at the quantum mechanical level, but as just our, these particular tools we have,

11:21.720 --> 11:26.320
 which is the few senses and cognitive abilities to process those senses.

11:26.320 --> 11:31.400
 Well, that last phrase, having the cognitive abilities to process them carries a lot, right?

11:31.400 --> 11:36.640
 I mean, there is our sort of intuitive understanding of the world.

11:36.640 --> 11:41.040
 You don't need to teach people about gravity for them to know that apples fall from trees,

11:41.040 --> 11:42.040
 right?

11:42.040 --> 11:43.960
 That's something that we figure out pretty quickly.

11:43.960 --> 11:47.480
 Project permanence, things like that, the three dimensionality of space, even if we

11:47.480 --> 11:52.000
 don't have the mathematical language to say that, we kind of know that it's true.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.280
 On the other hand, no one opens their eyes and sees atoms, right?

11:56.280 --> 12:00.240
 Or molecules or cells for that matter, forget about quantum mechanics.

12:00.240 --> 12:07.520
 So but we got there, we got to understanding that there are atoms and cells using the combination

12:07.520 --> 12:11.080
 of our senses and our cognitive capacities.

12:11.080 --> 12:16.860
 So adding the ability of our cognitive capacities to our senses is adding an enormous amount

12:16.860 --> 12:19.640
 and I don't think it is a hard and fast boundary.

12:19.640 --> 12:23.480
 You know, if you believe in cells, if you believe that we understand those, then there's

12:23.480 --> 12:29.840
 no reason you believe we can't believe in quantum mechanics just as well.

12:29.840 --> 12:36.960
 What to you is the most beautiful idea in physics?

12:36.960 --> 12:38.500
 Conservation of momentum.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.760
 Can you elaborate?

12:39.760 --> 12:40.760
 Yeah.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.240
 So if you were Aristotle, when Aristotle wrote his book on physics, he made the following

12:44.240 --> 12:45.240
 very obvious point.

12:45.240 --> 12:46.240
 We're on video here, right?

12:46.240 --> 12:47.240
 So people can see this.

12:47.240 --> 12:48.240
 Yeah.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.400
 So if I push the bottle, let me cover this bottle so we do not have a mess, but okay.

12:51.400 --> 12:56.040
 So I push the bottle, it moves, and if I stop pushing, it stops moving.

12:56.040 --> 13:00.940
 And this kind of thing is repeated a large number of times all over the place.

13:00.940 --> 13:03.640
 If you don't keep pushing things, they stop moving.

13:03.640 --> 13:09.040
 This is an indisputably true fact about our everyday environment, okay?

13:09.040 --> 13:15.040
 And for Aristotle, this blew up into a whole picture of the world in which things had natures

13:15.040 --> 13:19.600
 and teleologies, and they had places they wanted to be, and when you were pushing them,

13:19.600 --> 13:23.040
 you were moving them away from where they wanted to be, and they would return and stuff

13:23.040 --> 13:24.360
 like that.

13:24.360 --> 13:31.880
 And it took a thousand years or 1500 years for people to say, actually, if it weren't

13:31.880 --> 13:37.280
 for things like dissipation and air resistance and friction and so forth, the natural thing

13:37.280 --> 13:42.960
 is for things to move forever in a straight line, there's a constant velocity, right?

13:42.960 --> 13:44.680
 Conservation of momentum.

13:44.680 --> 13:51.200
 And the reason why I think that's the most beautiful idea in physics is because it shifts

13:51.200 --> 13:58.140
 us from a view of natures and teleology to a view of patterns in the world.

13:58.140 --> 14:05.000
 So when you were Aristotle, you needed to talk a vocabulary of why is this happening,

14:05.000 --> 14:08.380
 what's the purpose of it, what's the cause, etc., because, you know, it's nature does

14:08.380 --> 14:12.280
 or does not want to do that, whereas once you believe in conservation of momentum, things

14:12.280 --> 14:13.760
 just happen.

14:13.760 --> 14:15.320
 They just follow the pattern.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.920
 You give me, you have Laplace's demon, ultimately, right?

14:17.920 --> 14:21.120
 You give me the state of the world today, I can predict what it's going to do in the

14:21.120 --> 14:23.180
 future, I can predict where it was in the past.

14:23.180 --> 14:26.880
 It's impersonal, and it's also instantaneous.

14:26.880 --> 14:30.920
 It's not directed toward any future goals, it's just doing what it does given the current

14:30.920 --> 14:32.320
 state of the universe.

14:32.320 --> 14:37.080
 I think even more than either classical mechanics or quantum mechanics, that is the profound

14:37.080 --> 14:40.660
 deep insight that gets modern science off the ground.

14:40.660 --> 14:45.400
 You don't need natures and purposes and goals, you just need some patterns.

14:45.400 --> 14:51.160
 So it's the first moment in our understanding of the way the universe works where you branch

14:51.160 --> 14:57.820
 from the intuitive physical space to kind of the space of ideas.

14:57.820 --> 15:03.380
 And also the other point you said, which is, conveniently, most of the interesting ideas

15:03.380 --> 15:05.940
 are acting in the moment.

15:05.940 --> 15:09.000
 You don't need to know the history of time or the future.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
 And of course, this took a long time to get there, right?

15:12.000 --> 15:16.260
 I mean, the conservation of momentum itself took hundreds of years.

15:16.260 --> 15:19.080
 It's weird, because like, someone would say something interesting, and then the next interesting

15:19.080 --> 15:22.200
 thing would be said like 150 or 200 years later, right?

15:22.200 --> 15:25.060
 They weren't even talking to each other, they were reading each other's books.

15:25.060 --> 15:30.640
 And probably the first person to directly say that in outer space, in the vacuum, a

15:30.640 --> 15:35.880
 projectile would move at a constant velocity was Avicenna, Ibn Sina in the Persian Golden

15:35.880 --> 15:38.200
 Age, circa 1000.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.700
 And he didn't like the idea.

15:39.700 --> 15:44.600
 He used that, just like Schrodinger used Schrodinger's cat to say, surely you don't believe that,

15:44.600 --> 15:45.600
 right?

15:45.600 --> 15:48.760
 Ibn Sina was saying, surely you don't believe there really is a vacuum, because if there

15:48.760 --> 15:52.300
 was a really vacuum, things could keep moving forever, right?

15:52.300 --> 15:56.040
 But still, he got right the idea that there was this conservation of something impetus

15:56.040 --> 15:58.300
 or mile, he would call it.

15:58.300 --> 16:03.100
 And that's 500 years, 600 years before classical mechanics and Isaac Newton.

16:03.100 --> 16:07.000
 So Galileo played a big role in this, but he didn't exactly get it right.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.280
 And so it just takes a long time for this to sink in, because it is so against our everyday

16:12.280 --> 16:13.280
 experience.

16:13.280 --> 16:21.580
 Do you think it was a big leap, a brave or a difficult leap of sort of math and science

16:21.580 --> 16:25.280
 to be able to say that momentum is conserved?

16:25.280 --> 16:26.280
 I do.

16:26.280 --> 16:31.420
 You know, I think it's an example of human reason in action.

16:31.420 --> 16:36.020
 You know, even Aristotle knew that his theory had issues, because you could fire an arrow

16:36.020 --> 16:38.700
 and it would go a long way before it stopped.

16:38.700 --> 16:42.720
 So if his theory was things just automatically stop, what's going on?

16:42.720 --> 16:43.720
 And he had this elaborate story.

16:43.720 --> 16:48.440
 I don't know if you've heard the story, but the arrow would push the air in front of it

16:48.440 --> 16:53.300
 away and the molecules of air would run around to the back of the arrow and push it again.

16:53.300 --> 16:56.860
 And anyone reading this is going like, really, that's what you thought?

16:56.860 --> 17:00.660
 But it was that kind of thought experiment that ultimately got people to say like, actually,

17:00.660 --> 17:04.460
 no, if it weren't for the air molecules at all, the arrow would just go on by itself.

17:04.460 --> 17:09.980
 And it's always this give and take between thought and experience, back and forth, right?

17:09.980 --> 17:13.740
 Theory and experiment, we would say today.

17:13.740 --> 17:20.420
 Another big question that I think comes up, certainly with quantum mechanics, is what's

17:20.420 --> 17:25.720
 the difference between math and physics to you?

17:25.720 --> 17:30.280
 To me, you know, very, very roughly, math is about the logical structure of all possible

17:30.280 --> 17:35.100
 worlds and physics is about our actual world.

17:35.100 --> 17:40.820
 And it just feels like our actual world is a gray area when you start talking about interpretations

17:40.820 --> 17:43.060
 of quantum mechanics, or no?

17:43.060 --> 17:47.940
 I'm certainly using the word world in the broadest sense, all of reality.

17:47.940 --> 17:50.740
 So I think that reality is specific.

17:50.740 --> 17:54.420
 I don't think that there's every possible thing going on in reality.

17:54.420 --> 17:58.520
 I think that there are rules, whether it's the Schrodinger equation or whatever.

17:58.520 --> 18:03.180
 So I think that there's a sensible notion of the set of all possible worlds and we live

18:03.180 --> 18:04.440
 in one of them.

18:04.440 --> 18:07.980
 The world that we're talking about might be a multiverse, might be many worlds of quantum

18:07.980 --> 18:10.940
 mechanics, might be much bigger than the world of our everyday experience, but it's still

18:10.940 --> 18:15.940
 one physically contiguous world in some sense.

18:15.940 --> 18:24.220
 But so if you look at the overlap of math and physics, it feels like when physics tries

18:24.220 --> 18:30.620
 to reach for understanding of our world, it uses the tools of math to sort of reach beyond

18:30.620 --> 18:34.320
 the limit of our current understanding.

18:34.320 --> 18:41.380
 What do you make of that process of sort of using math to, so you start maybe with intuition

18:41.380 --> 18:45.500
 or you might start with the math and then build up an intuition or, but this kind of

18:45.500 --> 18:49.540
 reaching into the darkness, into the mystery of the world with math.

18:49.540 --> 18:51.700
 Well, I think I would put it a little bit differently.

18:51.700 --> 18:57.900
 I think we have theories, theories of the physical world, which we then extrapolate

18:57.900 --> 19:02.380
 and ask, you know, what do we conclude if we take these seriously well beyond where

19:02.380 --> 19:03.700
 we've actually tested them?

19:03.700 --> 19:09.180
 It is separately true that math is really, really useful when we construct physical theories

19:09.180 --> 19:13.060
 and you know, famously Eugene Wigner asked about the unreasonable success of mathematics

19:13.060 --> 19:14.060
 and physics.

19:14.060 --> 19:20.140
 I think that's a little bit wrong because anything that could happen, any other theory

19:20.140 --> 19:24.700
 of physics that wasn't the real world, but some other world, you could always describe

19:24.700 --> 19:25.700
 it mathematically.

19:25.700 --> 19:28.180
 It's just that it might be a mess.

19:28.180 --> 19:33.660
 The surprising thing is not that math works, but that the math is so simple and easy that

19:33.660 --> 19:35.660
 you can write it down on a t shirt, right?

19:35.660 --> 19:37.640
 I mean, that's what is amazing.

19:37.640 --> 19:44.020
 That's an enormous compression of information that seems to be valid in the real world.

19:44.020 --> 19:48.340
 So that's an interesting fact about our world, which maybe we could hope to explain or just

19:48.340 --> 19:49.620
 take as a brute fact.

19:49.620 --> 19:50.880
 I don't know.

19:50.880 --> 19:56.100
 But once you have that, you know, there's this indelible relationship between math and

19:56.100 --> 19:59.380
 physics, but philosophically I do want to separate them.

19:59.380 --> 20:03.740
 What we extrapolate, we don't extrapolate math because there's a whole bunch of wrong

20:03.740 --> 20:06.060
 math, you know, that doesn't apply to our world, right?

20:06.060 --> 20:09.980
 We extrapolate the physical theory that we best think explains our world.

20:09.980 --> 20:12.700
 Again, an unanswerable question.

20:12.700 --> 20:19.780
 Why do you think our world is so easily compressible into beautiful equations?

20:19.780 --> 20:20.780
 Yeah.

20:20.780 --> 20:23.940
 I mean, like I just hinted at, I don't know if there's an answer to that question.

20:23.940 --> 20:24.940
 There could be.

20:24.940 --> 20:26.460
 What would an answer look like?

20:26.460 --> 20:31.380
 Well, an answer could look like if you showed that there was something about our world that

20:31.380 --> 20:33.260
 maximizes something.

20:33.260 --> 20:40.100
 You know, the mean of the simplicity and the powerfulness of the laws of physics or, you

20:40.100 --> 20:41.920
 know, maybe we're just generic.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.980
 Maybe in the set of all possible worlds, this is what the world would look like, right?

20:44.980 --> 20:46.500
 Like I don't really know.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.340
 I tend to think not.

20:48.340 --> 20:54.220
 I tend to think that there is something specific and rock bottom about the facts of our world

20:54.220 --> 20:56.060
 that don't have further explanation.

20:56.060 --> 20:58.260
 Like the fact of the world exists at all.

20:58.260 --> 21:00.780
 And furthermore, the specific laws of physics that we have.

21:00.780 --> 21:04.660
 I think that in some sense, we're just going to, at some level, we're going to say, and

21:04.660 --> 21:05.660
 that's how it is.

21:05.660 --> 21:07.340
 And, you know, we can't explain anything more.

21:07.340 --> 21:11.580
 I don't know how, if we're anywhere close to that right now, but that seems plausible

21:11.580 --> 21:12.580
 to me.

21:12.580 --> 21:16.780
 And speaking of rock bottom, one of the things sort of your book kind of reminded me or revealed

21:16.780 --> 21:23.340
 to me is that what's fundamental and what's emergent, it just feels like I don't even

21:23.340 --> 21:28.420
 know anymore what's fundamental in physics, if there's anything.

21:28.420 --> 21:33.980
 It feels like everything, especially with quantum mechanics, is revealing to us is that

21:33.980 --> 21:41.460
 most interesting things that I would, as a limited human would think are fundamental

21:41.460 --> 21:48.980
 can actually be explained as emergent from the more deeper laws.

21:48.980 --> 21:51.140
 I mean, we don't know, of course.

21:51.140 --> 21:52.480
 You had to get that on the table.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.620
 We don't know what is fundamental.

21:54.620 --> 22:00.480
 We do have reasons to say that certain things are more fundamental than others, right?

22:00.480 --> 22:03.980
 Atoms and molecules are more fundamental than cells and organs.

22:03.980 --> 22:07.600
 Quantum fields are more fundamental than atoms and molecules.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.780
 We don't know if that ever bottoms out.

22:09.780 --> 22:13.860
 I do think that there's sensible ways to think about this.

22:13.860 --> 22:18.140
 If you describe something like this table as a table, it has a height and a width and

22:18.140 --> 22:22.580
 it's made of a certain material and it has a certain solidity and weight and so forth.

22:22.580 --> 22:24.940
 That's a very useful description as far as it goes.

22:24.940 --> 22:29.380
 There's a whole other description of this table in terms of a whole collection of atoms

22:29.380 --> 22:31.640
 strung together in certain ways.

22:31.640 --> 22:36.340
 The language of the atoms is more comprehensive than the language of the table.

22:36.340 --> 22:41.100
 You could break apart the table, smash it to pieces, still talk about it as atoms, but

22:41.100 --> 22:43.940
 you could no longer talk about it as a table, right?

22:43.940 --> 22:48.380
 So I think that this comprehensiveness, the domain of validity of a theory gets broader

22:48.380 --> 22:52.900
 and broader as the theory gets more and more fundamental.

22:52.900 --> 22:57.620
 So what do you think Newton would say?

22:57.620 --> 23:02.140
 Maybe right in the book review, if you read your latest book on quantum mechanics, something

23:02.140 --> 23:03.140
 deeply hidden.

23:03.140 --> 23:08.140
 It would take a long time for him to think that any of this was making any sense.

23:08.140 --> 23:10.260
 You catch him up pretty quick in the beginning.

23:10.260 --> 23:11.260
 Yeah.

23:11.260 --> 23:13.220
 You give him a shout out in the beginning.

23:13.220 --> 23:14.220
 That's right.

23:14.220 --> 23:15.220
 He is the man.

23:15.220 --> 23:19.460
 I'm happy to say that Newton was the greatest scientist who ever lived.

23:19.460 --> 23:22.500
 He invented calculus in his spare time, which would have made him the greatest mathematician

23:22.500 --> 23:25.620
 just all by himself, all by that one thing.

23:25.620 --> 23:33.540
 But of course, it's funny because Newton was in some sense still a pre modern thinker.

23:33.540 --> 23:39.480
 Rocky Kolb, who is a cosmologist at the University of Chicago said that Galileo, even though

23:39.480 --> 23:43.740
 he came before Newton, was a more modern thinker than Newton was.

23:43.740 --> 23:46.660
 If you got Galileo and brought him to the present day, it would take him six months

23:46.660 --> 23:49.580
 to catch up and then he'd be in your office telling you why your most recent paper was

23:49.580 --> 23:50.740
 wrong.

23:50.740 --> 23:55.440
 Whereas Newton just thought in this kind of more mystical way.

23:55.440 --> 24:01.920
 He wrote a lot more about the Bible and alchemy than he ever did about physics, but he was

24:01.920 --> 24:06.260
 also more brilliant than anybody else and way more mathematically astute than Galileo.

24:06.260 --> 24:08.420
 So I really don't know.

24:08.420 --> 24:12.060
 He might have, he might just, yeah, say like, give me the textbooks, leave me alone for

24:12.060 --> 24:15.200
 a few months and then be caught up.

24:15.200 --> 24:19.900
 But he might have had mental blocks against seeing the world in this way.

24:19.900 --> 24:20.900
 I really don't know.

24:20.900 --> 24:24.780
 Or perhaps find an interesting mystical interpretation of quantum mechanics.

24:24.780 --> 24:25.780
 Very possible.

24:25.780 --> 24:26.780
 Yeah.

24:26.780 --> 24:31.500
 Is there any other scientists or philosophers through history that you would like to know

24:31.500 --> 24:33.580
 their opinion of your book?

24:33.580 --> 24:36.420
 That's a, that's a good question.

24:36.420 --> 24:38.500
 I mean, Einstein is the obvious one, right?

24:38.500 --> 24:42.100
 We all, I mean, he was not that long ago, but I even speculated at the end of my book

24:42.100 --> 24:44.140
 about what his opinion would be.

24:44.140 --> 24:50.140
 I am curious as to, you know, what about older philosophers like Hume or Kant, right?

24:50.140 --> 24:51.140
 Like what would they have thought?

24:51.140 --> 24:55.840
 Or Aristotle, you know, what would they have thought about modern physics?

24:55.840 --> 25:01.980
 Because they do in philosophy, your predilections end up playing a much bigger role in your

25:01.980 --> 25:07.180
 ultimate conclusions because you're not as tied down by what the data is in physics.

25:07.180 --> 25:11.060
 You know, physics is lucky because we can't stray too far off the reservation as long

25:11.060 --> 25:15.820
 as we're trying to explain the world that we actually see in our telescopes and microscopes.

25:15.820 --> 25:20.900
 But it's just not fair to play that game because the people we're thinking about didn't know

25:20.900 --> 25:23.580
 a whole bunch of things that we know, right?

25:23.580 --> 25:26.380
 Like we lived through a lot that they didn't live through.

25:26.380 --> 25:32.700
 So by the time we got them caught up, they'd be different people.

25:32.700 --> 25:35.940
 So let me ask a bunch of basic questions.

25:35.940 --> 25:40.220
 I think it would be interesting, useful for people who are not familiar, but even for

25:40.220 --> 25:42.940
 people who are extremely well familiar.

25:42.940 --> 25:47.260
 Let's start with what is quantum mechanics?

25:47.260 --> 25:51.820
 Quantum mechanics is the paradigm of physics that came into being in the early part of

25:51.820 --> 25:58.380
 the 20th century that replaced classical mechanics, and it replaced classical mechanics in a weird

25:58.380 --> 26:00.380
 way that we're still coming to terms with.

26:00.380 --> 26:05.580
 So in classical mechanics, you have an object, it has a location, it has a velocity, and

26:05.580 --> 26:08.660
 if you know the location and velocity of everything in the world, you can say what everything's

26:08.660 --> 26:10.420
 going to do.

26:10.420 --> 26:15.660
 Quantum mechanics has an aspect of it that is kind of on the same lines.

26:15.660 --> 26:19.340
 There's something called the quantum state or the wave function.

26:19.340 --> 26:22.260
 And there's an equation governing what the quantum state does.

26:22.260 --> 26:23.980
 So it's very much like classical mechanics.

26:23.980 --> 26:25.660
 The wave function is different.

26:25.660 --> 26:26.980
 It's sort of a wave.

26:26.980 --> 26:31.380
 It's a vector in a huge dimensional vector space rather than a position and a velocity,

26:31.380 --> 26:33.060
 but okay, that's a detail.

26:33.060 --> 26:37.700
 The equation is the Schrodinger equation, not Newton's laws, but okay, again, a detail.

26:37.700 --> 26:41.380
 Where quantum mechanics really becomes weird and different is that there's a whole other

26:41.380 --> 26:46.820
 set of rules in our textbook formulation of quantum mechanics in addition to saying that

26:46.820 --> 26:49.320
 there's a quantum state and it evolves in time.

26:49.320 --> 26:52.820
 And all these new rules have to do with what happens when you look at the system, when

26:52.820 --> 26:55.100
 you observe it, when you measure it.

26:55.100 --> 26:58.420
 In classical mechanics, there were no rules about observing.

26:58.420 --> 27:00.260
 You just look at it and you see what's going on.

27:00.260 --> 27:01.580
 That was it, right?

27:01.580 --> 27:06.940
 In quantum mechanics, the way we teach it, there's something profoundly fundamental about

27:06.940 --> 27:12.260
 the act of measurement or observation, and the system dramatically changes its state.

27:12.260 --> 27:16.780
 Even though it has a wave function, like the electron in an atom is not orbiting in a circle,

27:16.780 --> 27:21.460
 it's sort of spread out in a cloud, when you look at it, you don't see that cloud.

27:21.460 --> 27:24.840
 When you look at it, it looks like a particle with a location.

27:24.840 --> 27:29.380
 So it dramatically changes its state right away, and the effects of that change can be

27:29.380 --> 27:32.120
 instantly seen in what the electron does next.

27:32.120 --> 27:39.060
 So again, we need to be careful because we don't agree on what quantum mechanics says.

27:39.060 --> 27:41.660
 That's why I need to say like in the textbook view, et cetera, right?

27:41.660 --> 27:48.540
 But in the textbook view, quantum mechanics, unlike any other theory of physics, gives

27:48.540 --> 27:51.060
 a fundamental role to the act of measurement.

27:51.060 --> 27:56.980
 So maybe even more basic, what is an atom and what is an electron?

27:56.980 --> 27:57.980
 Sure.

27:57.980 --> 28:01.780
 This all came together in a few years around the turn of the last century, right?

28:01.780 --> 28:05.180
 Around the year 1900.

28:05.180 --> 28:09.220
 Atoms predated then, of course, the word atom goes back to the ancient Greeks, but it was

28:09.220 --> 28:15.300
 the chemists in the 1800s that really first got experimental evidence for atoms.

28:15.300 --> 28:21.020
 They realized that there were two different types of tin oxide.

28:21.020 --> 28:25.300
 And in these two different types of tin oxide, there was exactly twice as much oxygen in

28:25.300 --> 28:27.180
 one type as the other.

28:27.180 --> 28:28.940
 And like, why is that?

28:28.940 --> 28:31.700
 Why is it never 1.5 times as much, right?

28:31.700 --> 28:38.280
 And so Dalton said, well, it's because there are tin atoms and oxygen atoms, and one form

28:38.280 --> 28:42.940
 of tin oxide is one atom of tin and one atom of oxygen, and the other is one atom of tin

28:42.940 --> 28:44.820
 and two atoms of oxygen.

28:44.820 --> 28:49.220
 And on the basis of this, you know, a speculation, a theory, right, a hypothesis, but then on

28:49.220 --> 28:52.900
 the basis of that, you make other predictions, and the chemists became quickly convinced

28:52.900 --> 28:54.540
 that atoms were real.

28:54.540 --> 28:58.880
 The physicists took a lot longer to catch on, but eventually they did.

28:58.880 --> 29:04.380
 And I mean, Boltzmann, who believed in atoms, had a really tough time his whole life because

29:04.380 --> 29:07.220
 he worked in Germany where atoms were not popular.

29:07.220 --> 29:09.800
 They were popular in England, but not in Germany.

29:09.800 --> 29:15.160
 And there, in general, the idea of atoms is, it's the most, the smallest building block

29:15.160 --> 29:17.080
 of the universe for them.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.080
 That's the kind of how they thought it was.

29:18.080 --> 29:22.760
 That was the Greek idea, but the chemists in the 1800s jumped the gun a little bit.

29:22.760 --> 29:27.860
 So these days, an atom is the smallest building block of a chemical element, right?

29:27.860 --> 29:33.180
 Hydrogen, tin, oxygen, carbon, whatever, but we know that atoms can be broken up further

29:33.180 --> 29:34.180
 than that.

29:34.180 --> 29:40.620
 That's what physicists discovered in the early 1900s, Rutherford, especially, and his colleagues.

29:40.620 --> 29:46.740
 So the atom that we think about now, the cartoon, is that picture you've always seen of a little

29:46.740 --> 29:50.260
 nucleus and then electrons orbiting it like a little solar system.

29:50.260 --> 29:53.180
 And we now know the nucleus is made of protons and neutrons.

29:53.180 --> 29:58.640
 So the weight of the atom, the mass, is almost all in its nucleus.

29:58.640 --> 30:03.880
 Protons and neutrons are something like 1800 times as heavy as electrons are.

30:03.880 --> 30:09.020
 Protons are much lighter, but because they're lighter, they give all the life to the atoms.

30:09.020 --> 30:13.740
 So when atoms get together, combine chemically, when electricity flows through a system, it's

30:13.740 --> 30:16.900
 all the electrons that are doing all the work.

30:16.900 --> 30:21.300
 And where quantum mechanics steps in, as you mentioned, with the position of velocity with

30:21.300 --> 30:26.900
 classical mechanics and quantum mechanics is modeling the behavior of the electron.

30:26.900 --> 30:30.620
 I mean, you can model the behavior of anything, but the electron, because that's where the

30:30.620 --> 30:31.900
 fun is.

30:31.900 --> 30:34.580
 The electron was the biggest challenge right from the start.

30:34.580 --> 30:35.580
 Yeah.

30:35.580 --> 30:36.580
 So what's a wave function?

30:36.580 --> 30:43.540
 You said it's an interesting detail, but in any interpretation, what is the wave function

30:43.540 --> 30:44.540
 in quantum mechanics?

30:44.540 --> 30:50.260
 Well, you know, we had this idea from Rutherford that atoms look like little solar systems,

30:50.260 --> 30:54.760
 but people very quickly realize that can't possibly be right because if an electron is

30:54.760 --> 30:57.640
 orbiting in a circle, it will give off light.

30:57.640 --> 31:01.540
 All the light that we have in this room comes from electrons zooming up and down and wiggling.

31:01.540 --> 31:03.260
 That's what electromagnetic waves are.

31:03.260 --> 31:07.660
 And you can calculate how long would it take for the electron just to spiral into the nucleus?

31:07.660 --> 31:12.180
 And the answer is 10 to the minus 11 seconds, okay, 100 billionth of a second.

31:12.180 --> 31:14.380
 So that's not right.

31:14.380 --> 31:21.300
 Meanwhile, people had realized that light, which we understood from the 1800s was a wave,

31:21.300 --> 31:23.940
 had properties that were similar to that of particles, right?

31:23.940 --> 31:26.740
 This is Einstein and Planck and stuff like that.

31:26.740 --> 31:34.020
 So if something that we agree was a wave had particle like properties, then maybe something

31:34.020 --> 31:38.540
 we think is a particle, the electron has wave like properties, right?

31:38.540 --> 31:42.900
 And so a bunch of people eventually came to the conclusion, don't think about the electron

31:42.900 --> 31:47.180
 as a little point particle orbiting like a solar system.

31:47.180 --> 31:49.780
 Think of it as a wave that is spread out.

31:49.780 --> 31:53.100
 They cleverly gave this the name the wave function, which is the dopiest name in the

31:53.100 --> 31:57.420
 world for one of the most profound things in the universe.

31:57.420 --> 32:03.100
 There's literally a number at every point in space, which is the value of the electron's

32:03.100 --> 32:04.980
 wave function at that point.

32:04.980 --> 32:07.580
 And there's only one wave function.

32:07.580 --> 32:09.600
 Yeah, they eventually figured that out.

32:09.600 --> 32:10.960
 That took longer.

32:10.960 --> 32:15.220
 But when you have two electrons, you do not have a wave function for electron one and

32:15.220 --> 32:17.140
 a wave function for electron two.

32:17.140 --> 32:20.420
 You have one combined wave function for both of them.

32:20.420 --> 32:26.980
 And indeed, as you say, there's only one wave function for the entire universe at once.

32:26.980 --> 32:32.620
 And that's where this beautiful dance, can you say what is entanglement?

32:32.620 --> 32:35.580
 It seems one of the most fundamental ideas of quantum mechanics.

32:35.580 --> 32:39.580
 Well, let's temporarily buy into the textbook interpretation of quantum mechanics.

32:39.580 --> 32:43.820
 And what that says is that this wave function, so it's very small outside the atom, very

32:43.820 --> 32:48.940
 big in the atom, basically the wave function, you take it and you square it, you square

32:48.940 --> 32:54.220
 the number that gives you the probability of observing the system at that location.

32:54.220 --> 32:58.700
 So if you say that for two electrons, there's only one wave function, and that wave function

32:58.700 --> 33:03.060
 gives you the probability of observing both electrons at once doing something, okay?

33:03.060 --> 33:07.220
 So maybe the electron can be here or here, here, here, and the other electron can also

33:07.220 --> 33:08.300
 be there.

33:08.300 --> 33:12.600
 But we have a wave function set up where we don't know where either electron is going

33:12.600 --> 33:14.100
 to be seen.

33:14.100 --> 33:17.800
 But we know they'll both be seen in the same place, okay?

33:17.800 --> 33:22.100
 So we don't know exactly what we're going to see for either electron, but there's entanglement

33:22.100 --> 33:23.740
 between the two of them.

33:23.740 --> 33:25.460
 There's a sort of conditional statement.

33:25.460 --> 33:29.440
 If we see one in one location, then we know the other one's going to be doing a certain

33:29.440 --> 33:30.440
 thing.

33:30.440 --> 33:34.220
 So that's a feature of quantum mechanics that is nowhere to be found in classical mechanics.

33:34.220 --> 33:37.660
 In classical mechanics, there's no way I can say, well, I don't know where either one of

33:37.660 --> 33:40.700
 these particles is, but if I know, if I find out where this one is, then I know where the

33:40.700 --> 33:41.700
 other one is.

33:41.700 --> 33:42.700
 That just never happens.

33:42.700 --> 33:43.700
 They're truly separate.

33:43.700 --> 33:47.980
 I don't know, it feels like, if you think of a wave function like as a dance floor,

33:47.980 --> 33:53.860
 it seems like entanglement is strongest between things that are dancing together closest.

33:53.860 --> 33:56.420
 So there's a closeness that's important.

33:56.420 --> 33:58.340
 Well, that's another step.

33:58.340 --> 34:02.660
 We have to be careful here because in principle, if you're talking about the entanglement of

34:02.660 --> 34:08.860
 two electrons, for example, they can be totally entangled or totally unentangled no matter

34:08.860 --> 34:10.180
 where they are in the universe.

34:10.180 --> 34:15.180
 There's no relationship between the amount of entanglement and the distance between two

34:15.180 --> 34:16.180
 electrons.

34:16.180 --> 34:21.120
 But we now know that the reality of our best way of understanding the world is through

34:21.120 --> 34:23.860
 quantum fields, not through particles.

34:23.860 --> 34:28.540
 So even the electron, not just gravity and electromagnetism, but even the electron and

34:28.540 --> 34:33.160
 the quarks and so forth are really vibrations in quantum fields.

34:33.160 --> 34:38.340
 So even empty space is full of vibrating quantum fields.

34:38.340 --> 34:42.840
 And those quantum fields in empty space are entangled with each other in exactly the way

34:42.840 --> 34:43.840
 you just said.

34:43.840 --> 34:47.020
 If they're nearby, if you have like two vibrating quantum fields that are nearby, then they'll

34:47.020 --> 34:48.580
 be highly entangled.

34:48.580 --> 34:50.540
 If they're far away, they will not be entangled.

34:50.540 --> 34:52.880
 So what do quantum fields in a vacuum look like?

34:52.880 --> 34:53.880
 Empty space?

34:53.880 --> 34:54.880
 Just like empty space.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.600
 It's as empty as it can be.

34:56.600 --> 34:57.980
 But there's still a field.

34:57.980 --> 35:02.420
 It's just, what does nothing look like?

35:02.420 --> 35:06.340
 Just like right here, this location in space, there's a gravitational field, which I can

35:06.340 --> 35:07.980
 detect by dropping something.

35:07.980 --> 35:08.980
 Yes.

35:08.980 --> 35:12.860
 I don't see it, but there it is.

35:12.860 --> 35:17.860
 So we got a little bit of an idea of entanglement.

35:17.860 --> 35:23.980
 Now, what is Hilbert space and Euclidean space?

35:23.980 --> 35:28.180
 Yeah, you know, I think that people are very welcome to go through their lives not knowing

35:28.180 --> 35:29.360
 what Hilbert space is.

35:29.360 --> 35:33.580
 But if you dig into a little bit more into quantum mechanics, it becomes necessary.

35:33.580 --> 35:39.420
 You know, the English language was invented long before quantum mechanics, or various

35:39.420 --> 35:41.260
 forms of higher mathematics were invented.

35:41.260 --> 35:45.020
 So we use the word space to mean different things.

35:45.020 --> 35:48.700
 Of course, most of us think of space as this three dimensional world in which we live,

35:48.700 --> 35:49.700
 right?

35:49.700 --> 35:51.420
 I mean, some of us just think of it as outer space.

35:51.420 --> 35:56.420
 Okay, but space around us gives us the three dimensional location of things and objects.

35:56.420 --> 36:05.820
 But mathematicians use any generic abstract collection of elements as a space, okay?

36:05.820 --> 36:09.940
 A space of possibilities, you know, momentum space, etc.

36:09.940 --> 36:14.480
 So Hilbert space is the space of all possible quantum wave functions, either for the universe

36:14.480 --> 36:16.740
 or for some specific system.

36:16.740 --> 36:21.300
 And it could be an infinite dimensional space, or it could be just really, really large dimensional

36:21.300 --> 36:22.300
 but finite.

36:22.300 --> 36:24.960
 We don't know because we don't know the final theory of everything.

36:24.960 --> 36:29.540
 But this abstract Hilbert space is really, really, really big and has no immediate connection

36:29.540 --> 36:31.780
 to the three dimensional space in which we live.

36:31.780 --> 36:35.220
 What do dimensions in Hilbert space mean?

36:35.220 --> 36:40.020
 You know, it's just a way of mathematically representing how much information is contained

36:40.020 --> 36:41.660
 in the state of the system.

36:41.660 --> 36:45.720
 How many numbers do you have to give me to specify what the thing is doing?

36:45.720 --> 36:51.020
 So in classical mechanics, I give you the location of something by giving you three

36:51.020 --> 36:52.020
 numbers, right?

36:52.020 --> 36:54.340
 Up, down, left, X, Y, Z coordinates.

36:54.340 --> 37:00.100
 But then I might want to give you its entire state, physical state, which means both its

37:00.100 --> 37:02.680
 position and also its velocity.

37:02.680 --> 37:04.520
 The velocity also has three components.

37:04.520 --> 37:09.860
 So its state lives in something called phase space, which is six dimensional, three dimensions

37:09.860 --> 37:12.540
 of position, three dimensions of velocity.

37:12.540 --> 37:16.200
 And then if it also has an orientation in space, that's another three dimensions and

37:16.200 --> 37:17.200
 so forth.

37:17.200 --> 37:22.620
 So as you describe more and more information about the system, you have an abstract mathematical

37:22.620 --> 37:26.460
 space that has more and more numbers that you need to give.

37:26.460 --> 37:29.840
 And each one of those numbers corresponds to a dimension in that space.

37:29.840 --> 37:34.760
 So in terms of the amount of information, what is entropy?

37:34.760 --> 37:40.740
 This mystical word that's overused in math and physics, but has a very specific meaning

37:40.740 --> 37:41.940
 in this context.

37:41.940 --> 37:44.300
 Sadly, it has more than one very specific meeting.

37:44.300 --> 37:46.660
 This is the reason why it is hard.

37:46.660 --> 37:49.200
 Entropy means different things even to different physicists.

37:49.200 --> 37:54.120
 But one way of thinking about it is a measure of how much we don't know about the state

37:54.120 --> 37:55.160
 of a system.

37:55.160 --> 38:00.540
 So if I have a bottle of water molecules, and I know that, OK, there's a certain number

38:00.540 --> 38:01.540
 of water molecules.

38:01.540 --> 38:02.940
 I could weigh it and figure out.

38:02.940 --> 38:06.740
 I know the volume of it, and I know the temperature and pressure and things like that.

38:06.740 --> 38:12.280
 I certainly don't know the exact position and velocity of every water molecule.

38:12.280 --> 38:15.600
 So there's a certain amount of information I know, a certain amount that I don't know

38:15.600 --> 38:18.540
 that is part of the complete state of the system.

38:18.540 --> 38:23.340
 And that's what the entropy characterizes, how much unknown information there is, the

38:23.340 --> 38:28.300
 difference between what I do know about the system and its full exact microscopic state.

38:28.300 --> 38:36.660
 So when we try to describe a quantum mechanical system, is it infinite or finite but very

38:36.660 --> 38:37.660
 large?

38:37.660 --> 38:38.660
 Yeah, we don't know.

38:38.660 --> 38:39.660
 That depends on the system.

38:39.660 --> 38:44.300
 You know, it's easy to mathematically write down a system that would have a potentially

38:44.300 --> 38:47.480
 infinite entropy, an infinite dimensional Hilbert space.

38:47.480 --> 38:50.100
 So let's go back a little bit.

38:50.100 --> 38:54.340
 We said that the Hilbert space was the space in which quantum wave functions lived for

38:54.340 --> 38:57.220
 different systems that will be different sizes.

38:57.220 --> 38:58.420
 They could be infinite or finite.

38:58.420 --> 39:03.380
 So that's the number of numbers, the number of pieces of information you could potentially

39:03.380 --> 39:04.620
 give me about the system.

39:04.620 --> 39:11.100
 So the bigger Hilbert space is, the bigger the entropy of that system could be, depending

39:11.100 --> 39:12.100
 on what I know about it.

39:12.100 --> 39:16.260
 If I don't know anything about it, then it has a huge entropy, right, but only up to

39:16.260 --> 39:18.160
 the size of its Hilbert space.

39:18.160 --> 39:23.860
 So we don't know in the real physical world whether or not, you know, this region of space

39:23.860 --> 39:29.140
 that contains that water bottle has potentially an infinite entropy or just a finite entropy.

39:29.140 --> 39:31.580
 We have different arguments on different sides.

39:31.580 --> 39:35.640
 So if it's infinite, how do you think about infinity?

39:35.640 --> 39:42.020
 Is this something you can, your cognitive abilities are able to process or is it just

39:42.020 --> 39:44.060
 a mathematical tool?

39:44.060 --> 39:45.060
 It's somewhere in between, right?

39:45.060 --> 39:46.420
 I mean, we can say things about it.

39:46.420 --> 39:51.220
 We can use mathematical tools to manipulate infinity very, very accurately.

39:51.220 --> 39:52.980
 We can define what we mean.

39:52.980 --> 39:56.180
 You know, for any number n, there's a number bigger than it.

39:56.180 --> 39:58.180
 So there's no biggest number, right?

39:58.180 --> 40:00.580
 So there's something called the total number of all numbers.

40:00.580 --> 40:01.640
 It's infinite.

40:01.640 --> 40:07.180
 But it is hard to wrap your brain around that, and I think that gives people pause because

40:07.180 --> 40:11.380
 we talk about infinity as if it's a number, but it has plenty of properties that real

40:11.380 --> 40:12.380
 numbers don't have.

40:12.380 --> 40:15.820
 You know, if you multiply infinity by two, you get infinity again, right?

40:15.820 --> 40:18.500
 That's a little bit different than what we're used to.

40:18.500 --> 40:19.500
 Okay.

40:19.500 --> 40:25.780
 But are you comfortable with the idea that in thinking of what the real world actually

40:25.780 --> 40:28.780
 is that infinity could be part of that world?

40:28.780 --> 40:31.380
 Are you comfortable that a world in some dimension, in some aspect?

40:31.380 --> 40:33.020
 I'm comfortable with lots of things.

40:33.020 --> 40:40.740
 I mean, you know, I don't want my level of comfort to affect what I think about the world.

40:40.740 --> 40:44.020
 You know, I'm pretty open minded about what the world could be at the fundamental level.

40:44.020 --> 40:47.900
 Yeah, but infinity is a tricky one.

40:47.900 --> 40:50.460
 It's not almost a question of comfort.

40:50.460 --> 40:56.420
 It's a question of, is it an overreach of our intuition?

40:56.420 --> 41:01.180
 Sort of, it could be a convenient, almost like when you add a constant to an equation

41:01.180 --> 41:06.860
 just because it'll help, it just feels like it's useful to at least be able to imagine

41:06.860 --> 41:13.380
 a concept, not directly, but in some kind of way that this feels like it's a description

41:13.380 --> 41:14.380
 of the real world.

41:14.380 --> 41:15.940
 Think of it this way.

41:15.940 --> 41:19.420
 There's only three numbers that are simple.

41:19.420 --> 41:24.380
 There's zero, there's one, and there's infinity.

41:24.380 --> 41:29.580
 A number like 318 is just bizarre.

41:29.580 --> 41:33.220
 You need a lot of bits to give me what that number is.

41:33.220 --> 41:36.660
 But zero and one and infinity, like once you have 300 things, you might as well have infinity

41:36.660 --> 41:37.660
 things, right?

41:37.660 --> 41:40.060
 Otherwise, you have to say when to stop making the things, right?

41:40.060 --> 41:44.860
 So there's a sense in which infinity is a very natural number of things to exist.

41:44.860 --> 41:50.420
 I was never comfortable with infinity because it's just such a, it was too good to be true.

41:50.420 --> 41:55.780
 Because in math, it just helps make things work out.

41:55.780 --> 42:02.800
 When things get very large, close to infinity, things seem to work out nicely.

42:02.800 --> 42:07.740
 It's kind of like, because my deepest passion is probably psychology.

42:07.740 --> 42:18.660
 And I'm uncomfortable how in the average, the beauty of how much we vary is lost.

42:18.660 --> 42:24.340
 In that same kind of sense, infinity seems like a convenient way to erase the details.

42:24.340 --> 42:29.320
 But the thing about infinity is it seems to pop up whether we like it or not, right?

42:29.320 --> 42:33.020
 Like you're trying to be a computer scientist, you ask yourself, well, how long will it take

42:33.020 --> 42:34.540
 this program to run?

42:34.540 --> 42:37.440
 And you realize, well, for some of them, the answer is infinitely long.

42:37.440 --> 42:39.540
 It's not because you tried to get there.

42:39.540 --> 42:43.420
 You wrote a five line computer program, it doesn't halt.

42:43.420 --> 42:48.220
 So coming back to the textbook definition of quantum mechanics, this idea that I don't

42:48.220 --> 42:55.300
 think we talked about, can you, this one of the most interesting philosophical points,

42:55.300 --> 43:02.100
 we talked at the human level, but at the physics level, that at least the textbook definition

43:02.100 --> 43:07.660
 of quantum mechanics separates what is observed and what is real.

43:07.660 --> 43:13.100
 One, how does that make you feel?

43:13.100 --> 43:19.020
 And two, what does it then mean to observe something and why is it different than what

43:19.020 --> 43:20.020
 is real?

43:20.020 --> 43:27.700
 Yeah, you know, my personal feeling, such as it is, is that things like measurement

43:27.700 --> 43:32.100
 and observers and stuff like that are not going to play a fundamental role in the ultimate

43:32.100 --> 43:33.100
 laws of physics.

43:33.100 --> 43:38.500
 But my feeling that way is because so far, that's where all the evidence has been pointing.

43:38.500 --> 43:39.960
 I could be wrong.

43:39.960 --> 43:45.920
 And there's certainly a sense in which it would be infinitely cool if somehow observation

43:45.920 --> 43:52.180
 or mental cogitation did play a fundamental role in the nature of reality.

43:52.180 --> 43:53.180
 But I don't think so.

43:53.180 --> 43:54.580
 And again, I don't see any evidence for it.

43:54.580 --> 43:58.280
 So I'm not spending a lot of time worrying about that possibility.

43:58.280 --> 44:02.020
 So what do you do about the fact that in the textbook interpretation of quantum mechanics,

44:02.020 --> 44:07.860
 this idea of measurement or looking at things seems to play an important role?

44:07.860 --> 44:11.780
 Well, you come up with better interpretations of quantum mechanics and there are several

44:11.780 --> 44:12.780
 alternatives.

44:12.780 --> 44:17.180
 My favorite is the many worlds interpretation, which says two things.

44:17.180 --> 44:22.180
 Number one, you, the observer, are just a quantum system like anything else.

44:22.180 --> 44:23.660
 There's nothing special about you.

44:23.660 --> 44:27.260
 Don't get so proud of yourself, you know, you're just a bunch of atoms.

44:27.260 --> 44:31.300
 You have a wave function, you obey the Schrodinger equation like everything else.

44:31.300 --> 44:35.940
 And number two, when you think you're measuring something or observing something, what's really

44:35.940 --> 44:40.480
 happening is you're becoming entangled with that thing.

44:40.480 --> 44:43.820
 So when you think there's a wave function for the electron, it's all spread out.

44:43.820 --> 44:46.660
 But you look at it and you only see it in one location.

44:46.660 --> 44:50.060
 What's really happening is that there's still the wave function for the electron in all

44:50.060 --> 44:51.060
 those locations.

44:51.060 --> 44:55.960
 But now it's entangled with the wave function of you in the following way.

44:55.960 --> 44:59.340
 There's part of the wave function that says the electron was here and you think you saw

44:59.340 --> 45:00.340
 it there.

45:00.340 --> 45:02.380
 The electron was there and you think you saw it there.

45:02.380 --> 45:05.620
 The electron was over there and you think you saw it there, etc.

45:05.620 --> 45:10.260
 So in all of those different parts of the wave function, once they come into being,

45:10.260 --> 45:11.600
 no longer talk to each other.

45:11.600 --> 45:13.820
 They no longer interact or influence each other.

45:13.820 --> 45:16.380
 It's as if they are separate worlds.

45:16.380 --> 45:21.620
 So this was the invention of Hugh Everett III, who was a graduate student at Princeton

45:21.620 --> 45:22.620
 in the 1950s.

45:22.620 --> 45:28.600
 And he said, basically, look, you don't need all these extra rules about looking at things.

45:28.600 --> 45:31.020
 Just listen to what the Schrodinger equation is telling you.

45:31.020 --> 45:35.300
 It's telling you that you have a wave function, that you become entangled, and that the different

45:35.300 --> 45:37.820
 versions of you no longer talk to each other.

45:37.820 --> 45:39.420
 So just accept it.

45:39.420 --> 45:41.540
 It's just he did therapy more than anything else.

45:41.540 --> 45:42.980
 He said, like, it's okay.

45:42.980 --> 45:45.060
 You don't need all these extra rules.

45:45.060 --> 45:47.200
 All you need to do is believe the Schrodinger equation.

45:47.200 --> 45:50.140
 The cost is there's a whole bunch of extra worlds out there.

45:50.140 --> 45:57.340
 So are the worlds being created whether there's an observer or not?

45:57.340 --> 46:01.520
 The worlds are created any time a quantum system that's in a superposition becomes entangled

46:01.520 --> 46:04.020
 with the outside world.

46:04.020 --> 46:06.140
 What's the outside world?

46:06.140 --> 46:07.140
 It depends.

46:07.140 --> 46:08.700
 Let's back up.

46:08.700 --> 46:13.980
 Whatever it really says, what his theory is, is there's a wave function of the universe

46:13.980 --> 46:17.240
 and it obeys the Schrodinger equation all the time.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.240
 That's it.

46:18.240 --> 46:20.580
 That's the full theory right there.

46:20.580 --> 46:27.140
 The question, all of the work is how in the world do you map that theory onto reality,

46:27.140 --> 46:29.280
 onto what we observe?

46:29.280 --> 46:33.740
 So part of it is carving up the wave function into these separate worlds, saying, look,

46:33.740 --> 46:36.180
 it describes a whole bunch of things that don't interact with each other.

46:36.180 --> 46:38.120
 Let's call them separate worlds.

46:38.120 --> 46:41.860
 Another part is distinguishing between systems and their environments.

46:41.860 --> 46:45.660
 The environment is basically all the degrees of freedom, all the things going on in the

46:45.660 --> 46:48.100
 world that you don't keep track of.

46:48.100 --> 46:52.980
 So again, in the bottle of water, I might keep track of the total amount of water and

46:52.980 --> 46:53.980
 the volume.

46:53.980 --> 46:57.140
 I don't keep track of the individual positions and velocities.

46:57.140 --> 47:00.700
 I don't keep track of all the photons or the air molecules in this room.

47:00.700 --> 47:02.120
 So that's the outside world.

47:02.120 --> 47:06.180
 The outside world is all the parts of the universe that you're not keeping track of

47:06.180 --> 47:10.840
 when you're asking about the behavior of subsystem of it.

47:10.840 --> 47:14.220
 So how many worlds are there?

47:14.220 --> 47:17.100
 Yeah, we don't know that one either.

47:17.100 --> 47:18.860
 There could be an infinite number.

47:18.860 --> 47:21.660
 There could be only a finite number, but it's a big number one way or the other.

47:21.660 --> 47:23.860
 It's just a very, very big number.

47:23.860 --> 47:32.020
 In one of the talks, somebody asked, well, if it's finite.

47:32.020 --> 47:38.700
 So actually I'm not sure exactly the logic you used to derive this, but is there going

47:38.700 --> 47:47.540
 to be overlap, a duplicate world that you return to?

47:47.540 --> 47:52.020
 So you've mentioned, and I'd love if you can elaborate on sort of idea that it's possible

47:52.020 --> 47:56.780
 that there's some kind of equilibrium that these splitting worlds arrive at and then

47:56.780 --> 48:03.700
 maybe over time, maybe somehow connected to entropy, you get a large number of worlds

48:03.700 --> 48:05.260
 that are very similar to each other.

48:05.260 --> 48:06.260
 Yeah.

48:06.260 --> 48:11.860
 So this question of whether or not Hilbert space is finite or infinite dimensional is

48:11.860 --> 48:16.420
 actually secretly connected to gravity and cosmology.

48:16.420 --> 48:19.460
 This is the part that we're still struggling to understand right now, but we discovered

48:19.460 --> 48:25.220
 back in 1998 that our universe is accelerating and what that means if it continues, which

48:25.220 --> 48:26.940
 we think it probably will, but we're not sure.

48:26.940 --> 48:31.340
 But if it does, that means there's a horizon around us.

48:31.340 --> 48:34.820
 Because the universe is not only expanding, but expanding faster and faster, things can

48:34.820 --> 48:40.220
 get so far away from us that from our perspective, it looks like they're moving away faster in

48:40.220 --> 48:41.220
 the speed of light.

48:41.220 --> 48:42.580
 We will never see them again.

48:42.580 --> 48:47.400
 So there's literally a horizon around us and that horizon approaches some fixed distance

48:47.400 --> 48:48.780
 away from us.

48:48.780 --> 48:53.260
 And you can then argue that within that horizon, there's only a finite number of things that

48:53.260 --> 48:55.980
 can possibly happen, the finite dimensional Hilbert space.

48:55.980 --> 48:59.500
 In fact, we even have a guess for what the dimensionality is.

48:59.500 --> 49:04.540
 It's 10 to the power of 10 to the power of 122.

49:04.540 --> 49:05.540
 That's a very large number.

49:05.540 --> 49:06.540
 Yes.

49:06.540 --> 49:11.340
 Just to compare, the age of the universe is something like 10 to the 14 seconds, 10 to

49:11.340 --> 49:13.340
 the 17 or 18 seconds maybe.

49:13.340 --> 49:16.300
 The number of particles in the universe is 10 to the 88th.

49:16.300 --> 49:21.320
 But the number of dimensions of Hilbert space is 10 to the 10 to the 122.

49:21.320 --> 49:23.340
 So that's just crazy big.

49:23.340 --> 49:28.020
 If that story is right, that in our observable horizon, there's only a finite dimensional

49:28.020 --> 49:32.620
 Hilbert space, then this idea of branching of the wave function of the universe into

49:32.620 --> 49:37.780
 multiple distinct separate branches has to reach a limit at some time.

49:37.780 --> 49:41.780
 Once you branch that many times, you've run out of room in Hilbert space.

49:41.780 --> 49:46.620
 And roughly speaking, that corresponds to the universe just expanding and emptying out

49:46.620 --> 49:53.380
 and cooling off and entering a phase where it's just empty space, literally forever.

49:53.380 --> 49:58.900
 What's the difference between splitting and copying, do you think?

49:58.900 --> 50:09.220
 In terms of, a lot of this is an interpretation that helps us sort of model the world.

50:09.220 --> 50:16.860
 So perhaps shouldn't be thought of as like, you know, philosophically or metaphysically.

50:16.860 --> 50:24.180
 But in even at the physics level, do you see a difference between generating new copies

50:24.180 --> 50:26.900
 of the world or splitting?

50:26.900 --> 50:31.700
 I think it's better to think of in quantum mechanics in many worlds, the universe splits

50:31.700 --> 50:36.540
 rather than new copies, because people otherwise worry about things like energy conservation.

50:36.540 --> 50:40.340
 And no one who understands quantum mechanics worries about energy conservation, because

50:40.340 --> 50:42.340
 the equation is perfectly clear.

50:42.340 --> 50:45.720
 But if all you know is that someone told you the universe duplicates, then you have a reasonable

50:45.720 --> 50:48.660
 worry about where all the energy for that came from.

50:48.660 --> 50:53.620
 So a pre existing universe splitting into two skinnier universes is a better way of

50:53.620 --> 50:54.620
 thinking about it.

50:54.620 --> 50:58.380
 And mathematically, it's just like, you know, if you draw an x and y axis, and you draw

50:58.380 --> 51:04.540
 a vector of length one, 45 degree angle, you know that you can write that vector of length

51:04.540 --> 51:10.420
 one as the sum of two vectors pointing along x and y of length one over the square root

51:10.420 --> 51:11.420
 of two.

51:11.420 --> 51:14.940
 Okay, so I write one arrow as the sum of two arrows.

51:14.940 --> 51:17.020
 But there's a conservation of arrowness, right?

51:17.020 --> 51:20.940
 Like there's now two arrows, but the length is the same, I just I'm describing it in a

51:20.940 --> 51:21.940
 different way.

51:21.940 --> 51:25.700
 And that's exactly what happens when the universe branches, the the wave function of the universe

51:25.700 --> 51:27.380
 is a big old vector.

51:27.380 --> 51:34.020
 So to somebody who brings up a question of saying, doesn't this violate the conservation

51:34.020 --> 51:35.420
 of energy?

51:35.420 --> 51:38.060
 Can you give further elaboration?

51:38.060 --> 51:39.060
 Right?

51:39.060 --> 51:42.100
 So let's just be super duper perfectly clear.

51:42.100 --> 51:46.700
 There's zero question about whether or not many worlds violates conservation of energy.

51:46.700 --> 51:47.700
 Yes, it does not.

51:47.700 --> 51:48.700
 Great.

51:48.700 --> 51:51.980
 And I say this definitively, because there are other questions that I think there's answers

51:51.980 --> 51:55.620
 to, but they're legitimate questions, right about, you know, where does probability come

51:55.620 --> 51:59.900
 from and things like that, this conservation of energy question, we know the answer to

51:59.900 --> 52:00.900
 it.

52:00.900 --> 52:03.020
 And the answer to it is that energy is conserved.

52:03.020 --> 52:09.220
 All of the effort goes into how best to translate what the equation unambiguously says into

52:09.220 --> 52:11.040
 plain English, right?

52:11.040 --> 52:14.480
 So this idea that there's a universe that has that that the universe comes equipped

52:14.480 --> 52:18.700
 with a thickness, and it sort of divides up into thinner pieces, but the total amount

52:18.700 --> 52:25.360
 of universe is is conserved over time, is a reasonably good way of putting English words

52:25.360 --> 52:27.380
 to the underlying mathematics.

52:27.380 --> 52:33.220
 So one of my favorite things about many worlds is, I mean, I love that there's something

52:33.220 --> 52:35.400
 controversial in science.

52:35.400 --> 52:41.780
 And for some reason, it makes people actually not like upset, but just get excited.

52:41.780 --> 52:45.960
 Why do you think it is a controversial idea?

52:45.960 --> 52:52.380
 So there's a lot of, it's actually one of the cleanest ways to think about quantum mechanics.

52:52.380 --> 52:57.380
 So why do you think there's a discomfort a little bit among certain people?

52:57.380 --> 53:02.740
 Well, I draw the distinction in my book between two different kinds of simplicity in a physical

53:02.740 --> 53:03.740
 theory.

53:03.740 --> 53:06.300
 There's simplicity in the theory itself, right?

53:06.300 --> 53:10.220
 How we describe what's going on according to the theory by its own rights.

53:10.220 --> 53:13.480
 But then, you know, theory is just some sort of abstract mathematical formalism, you have

53:13.480 --> 53:16.860
 to map it onto the world somehow, right?

53:16.860 --> 53:23.000
 And sometimes, like for Newtonian physics, it's pretty obvious, like, okay, here is a

53:23.000 --> 53:26.260
 bottle and has a center of mass and things like that.

53:26.260 --> 53:30.660
 Sometimes it's a little bit harder with general relativity, curvature of space time is a little

53:30.660 --> 53:33.180
 bit harder to grasp.

53:33.180 --> 53:37.620
 quantum mechanics is very hard to map what you're the language you're talking in a wave

53:37.620 --> 53:40.460
 functions and things like that on to reality.

53:40.460 --> 53:45.260
 And many worlds is the version of quantum mechanics where it is hardest to map on the

53:45.260 --> 53:47.860
 underlying formalism to reality.

53:47.860 --> 53:53.260
 So that's where the lack of simplicity comes in, not in the theory, but in how we use the

53:53.260 --> 53:54.660
 theory to map on to reality.

53:54.660 --> 54:01.740
 In fact, all of the work in sort of elaborating many worlds quantum mechanics is in the this

54:01.740 --> 54:04.420
 effort to map it on to the world that we see.

54:04.420 --> 54:08.340
 So it's perfectly legitimate to be bugged by that, right?

54:08.340 --> 54:15.320
 To say like, well, no, that's just too far away from my experience, I am therefore intrinsically

54:15.320 --> 54:16.580
 skeptical of it.

54:16.580 --> 54:19.620
 Of course, you should give up on that skepticism if there are no alternatives.

54:19.620 --> 54:23.280
 And this theory always keeps working, then eventually you should overcome your skepticism.

54:23.280 --> 54:28.060
 But right now there are alternatives that are that, you know, people work to make alternatives

54:28.060 --> 54:31.780
 that are by their nature closer to what we observe directly.

54:31.780 --> 54:33.180
 Can you describe the alternatives?

54:33.180 --> 54:40.480
 I don't think we touched on it, sort of the Copenhagen interpretation and the many worlds.

54:40.480 --> 54:47.260
 Maybe there's a difference between the Everettian many worlds and many worlds as it is now,

54:47.260 --> 54:50.020
 like has the idea sort of developed and so on.

54:50.020 --> 54:54.060
 And just in general, what is the space of promising contenders?

54:54.060 --> 54:57.060
 We have democratic debates now, there's a bunch of candidates.

54:57.060 --> 54:59.540
 12 candidates on stage.

54:59.540 --> 55:02.480
 What are the quantum mechanical candidates on stage for the debate?

55:02.480 --> 55:08.540
 So if you had a debate between quantum mechanical contenders, there'd be no problem getting

55:08.540 --> 55:14.220
 12 people up there on stage, but there would still be only three front runners.

55:14.220 --> 55:19.460
 And right now the front runners would be Everett, hidden variable theories are another one.

55:19.460 --> 55:24.180
 So the hidden variable theories say that the wave function is real, but there's something

55:24.180 --> 55:25.820
 in addition to the wave function.

55:25.820 --> 55:29.440
 The wave function is not everything, it's part of reality, but it's not everything.

55:29.440 --> 55:30.880
 What else is there?

55:30.880 --> 55:36.020
 We're not sure, but in the simplest version of the theory, there are literally particles.

55:36.020 --> 55:43.100
 So many worlds says that quantum systems are sometimes are wave like in some ways and particle

55:43.100 --> 55:48.060
 like in another because they really, really are waves, but under certain observational

55:48.060 --> 55:50.460
 circumstances they look like particles.

55:50.460 --> 55:54.980
 Whereas hidden variable says they look like waves and particles because there are both

55:54.980 --> 55:58.760
 waves and particles involved in the dynamics.

55:58.760 --> 56:03.780
 And that's easy to do if your particles are just non relativistic Newtonian particles

56:03.780 --> 56:04.780
 moving around.

56:04.780 --> 56:07.740
 They get pushed around by the wave function roughly.

56:07.740 --> 56:13.300
 It becomes much harder when you take quantum field theory or quantum gravity into account.

56:13.300 --> 56:17.820
 The other big contender are spontaneous collapse theories.

56:17.820 --> 56:22.580
 So in the conventional textbook interpretation, we say when you look at a quantum system,

56:22.580 --> 56:27.260
 its wave function collapses and you see it in one location, a spontaneous collapse theory

56:27.260 --> 56:35.340
 says that every particle has a chance per second of having its wave function spontaneously

56:35.340 --> 56:36.460
 collapse.

56:36.460 --> 56:39.980
 The chance is very small for a typical particle, it will take hundreds of millions of years

56:39.980 --> 56:44.380
 before it happens even once, but in a table or some macroscopic object, there are way

56:44.380 --> 56:48.140
 more than a hundred million particles and they're all entangled with each other.

56:48.140 --> 56:52.860
 So when one of them collapses, it brings everything else along with it.

56:52.860 --> 56:54.260
 There's a slight variation of this.

56:54.260 --> 56:55.620
 That's a spontaneous collapse theory.

56:55.620 --> 57:00.260
 There are also induced collapse theories like Roger Penrose thinks that when the gravitational

57:00.260 --> 57:05.500
 difference between two parts of the wave function becomes too large, the wave function collapses

57:05.500 --> 57:06.860
 automatically.

57:06.860 --> 57:11.700
 So those are basically in my mind, the three big alternatives, many worlds, which is just

57:11.700 --> 57:16.060
 there's a wave function and always obeys the Schrodinger equation, hidden variables.

57:16.060 --> 57:18.820
 There's a wave function that always obeys the Schrodinger equation, but there are also

57:18.820 --> 57:24.420
 new variables or collapse theories, which the wave function sometimes obeys the Schrodinger

57:24.420 --> 57:26.220
 equation and sometimes it collapses.

57:26.220 --> 57:31.380
 So you can see that the alternatives are more complicated in their formalism than many worlds

57:31.380 --> 57:34.380
 is, but they are closer to our experience.

57:34.380 --> 57:42.220
 So just this moment of collapse, do you think of it as a wave function, fundamentally sort

57:42.220 --> 57:49.140
 of a probabilistic description of the world and this collapse sort of reducing that part

57:49.140 --> 57:53.740
 of the world into something deterministic, where again, you can now describe the position

57:53.740 --> 57:56.980
 and the velocity in this simple classical model?

57:56.980 --> 57:57.980
 Well there is...

57:57.980 --> 57:58.980
 Is that how you think about collapse?

57:58.980 --> 58:03.140
 There is a fourth category, there's a fourth contender, there's a mayor Pete of quantum

58:03.140 --> 58:08.140
 mechanical interpretations, which are called epistemic interpretations.

58:08.140 --> 58:13.220
 And what they say is all the wave function is, is a way of making predictions for experimental

58:13.220 --> 58:14.220
 outcomes.

58:14.220 --> 58:18.780
 It's not mapping onto an element of reality in any real sense.

58:18.780 --> 58:22.300
 And in fact, two different people might have two different wave functions for the same

58:22.300 --> 58:25.340
 physical system because they know different things about it, right?

58:25.340 --> 58:28.100
 The wave function is really just a prediction mechanism.

58:28.100 --> 58:32.980
 And then the problem with those epistemic interpretations is if you say, okay, but it's

58:32.980 --> 58:37.980
 predicting about what, like what is the thing that is being predicted?

58:37.980 --> 58:41.460
 And they say, no, no, no, that's not what we're here for.

58:41.460 --> 58:44.500
 We're just here to tell you what the observational outcomes are going to be.

58:44.500 --> 58:49.100
 But the other, the other interpretations kind of think that the wave function is real.

58:49.100 --> 58:50.760
 Yes, that's right.

58:50.760 --> 58:55.980
 So that's an ontic interpretation of the wave function, ontology being the study of what

58:55.980 --> 59:01.060
 is real, what exists, as opposed to an epistemic interpretation of the wave function, epistemology

59:01.060 --> 59:02.060
 being the study of what we know.

59:02.060 --> 59:06.580
 That would actually just love to see that debate on stage.

59:06.580 --> 59:10.500
 There was a version of it on stage at the world science festival a few years ago that

59:10.500 --> 59:11.500
 you can look up online.

59:11.500 --> 59:12.500
 On YouTube?

59:12.500 --> 59:13.500
 Yep.

59:13.500 --> 59:14.500
 It's on YouTube.

59:14.500 --> 59:15.500
 Okay, awesome.

59:15.500 --> 59:16.500
 I'll link it and watch it.

59:16.500 --> 59:17.500
 Who won?

59:17.500 --> 59:18.500
 I won.

59:18.500 --> 59:24.700
 I don't know, there was no vote, there was no vote, but those there's Brian Green was

59:24.700 --> 59:29.420
 the moderator and David Albert stood up for a spontaneous collapse and Shelley Goldstein

59:29.420 --> 59:34.460
 was there for hidden variables and Rüdiger Schock was there for epistemic approaches.

59:34.460 --> 59:38.980
 Why do you, I think you mentioned it, but just to elaborate, why do you find many worlds

59:38.980 --> 59:39.980
 so compelling?

59:39.980 --> 59:43.460
 Well, there's two reasons actually.

59:43.460 --> 59:45.540
 One is, like I said, it is the simplest, right?

59:45.540 --> 59:49.960
 It's like the most bare bones, austere, pure version of quantum mechanics.

59:49.960 --> 59:55.380
 And I am someone who is very willing to put a lot of work into mapping the formalism onto

59:55.380 --> 59:56.380
 reality.

59:56.380 --> 59:59.100
 I'm less willing to complicate the formalism itself.

59:59.100 --> 1:00:04.180
 But the other big reason is that there's something called modern physics with quantum fields

1:00:04.180 --> 1:00:09.280
 and quantum gravity and holography and space time doing things like that.

1:00:09.280 --> 1:00:14.540
 And when you take any of the other versions of quantum theory, they bring along classical

1:00:14.540 --> 1:00:21.820
 baggage, all of the other versions of quantum mechanics, prejudice or privilege some version

1:00:21.820 --> 1:00:26.020
 of classical reality like locations in space, okay?

1:00:26.020 --> 1:00:31.220
 And I think that that's a barrier to doing better at understanding the theory of everything

1:00:31.220 --> 1:00:34.460
 and understanding quantum gravity and the emergence of space time.

1:00:34.460 --> 1:00:38.660
 Whenever if you change your theory from, you know, here's a harmonic oscillator, oh, there's

1:00:38.660 --> 1:00:43.640
 a spin, here's an electromagnetic field, in hidden variable theories or dynamical collapse

1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:44.640
 theories.

1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:45.640
 You have to start from scratch.

1:00:45.640 --> 1:00:48.220
 You have to say like, well, what are the hidden variables for this theory or how does it collapse

1:00:48.220 --> 1:00:49.220
 or whatever?

1:00:49.220 --> 1:00:50.900
 Whereas many worlds is plug and play.

1:00:50.900 --> 1:00:53.900
 You tell me the theory and I can give you as many worlds version.

1:00:53.900 --> 1:00:58.900
 So when we have a situation like we have with gravity and space time, where the classical

1:00:58.900 --> 1:01:04.100
 description seems to break down in a dramatic way, then I think you should start from the

1:01:04.100 --> 1:01:07.160
 most quantum theory that you have, which is really many worlds.

1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:14.940
 So start with the quantum theory and try to build up a model of space time, the emergence

1:01:14.940 --> 1:01:15.940
 of space time.

1:01:15.940 --> 1:01:16.940
 That's it.

1:01:16.940 --> 1:01:17.940
 Okay.

1:01:17.940 --> 1:01:21.020
 So I thought space time was fundamental.

1:01:21.020 --> 1:01:22.360
 Yeah, I know.

1:01:22.360 --> 1:01:28.860
 So this sort of dream that Einstein had that everybody had and everybody has of, you know,

1:01:28.860 --> 1:01:30.660
 the theory of everything.

1:01:30.660 --> 1:01:37.460
 So how do we build up from many worlds from quantum mechanics, a model of space time model

1:01:37.460 --> 1:01:38.460
 of gravity?

1:01:38.460 --> 1:01:42.580
 Well, yeah, I mean, let me first mention very quickly why we think it's necessary.

1:01:42.580 --> 1:01:47.420
 You know, we've had gravity in the form that Einstein bequeathed it to us for over a hundred

1:01:47.420 --> 1:01:52.600
 years now, like 1915 or 1916, he put general relativity in the final form.

1:01:52.600 --> 1:01:57.020
 So gravity is the curvature of space time and there's a field that pervades all the

1:01:57.020 --> 1:02:00.100
 universe that tells us how curved space time is.

1:02:00.100 --> 1:02:01.980
 And that's a fundamentally classical.

1:02:01.980 --> 1:02:02.980
 That's totally classical.

1:02:02.980 --> 1:02:03.980
 Right.

1:02:03.980 --> 1:02:04.980
 Exactly.

1:02:04.980 --> 1:02:09.980
 But we also have a formalism, an algorithm for taking a classical theory and quantizing

1:02:09.980 --> 1:02:10.980
 it.

1:02:10.980 --> 1:02:13.900
 This is how we get quantum electrodynamics, for example.

1:02:13.900 --> 1:02:14.900
 And it could be tricky.

1:02:14.900 --> 1:02:19.500
 I mean, you think you're quantizing something, so that means taking a classical theory and

1:02:19.500 --> 1:02:22.400
 promoting it to a quantum mechanical theory.

1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:23.940
 But you can run into problems.

1:02:23.940 --> 1:02:27.460
 So they ran into problems and they did that with electromagnetism, namely that certain

1:02:27.460 --> 1:02:30.300
 quantities were infinity and you don't like infinity, right?

1:02:30.300 --> 1:02:35.200
 So Feynman and Tominaga and Schwinger won the Nobel Prize for teaching us how to deal

1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:36.200
 with the infinities.

1:02:36.200 --> 1:02:39.320
 And then Ken Wilson won another Nobel Prize for saying you shouldn't have been worried

1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:41.380
 about those infinities after all.

1:02:41.380 --> 1:02:45.400
 But still, that was the, it's always the thought that that's how you will make a good quantum

1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:46.400
 theory.

1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:47.860
 You'll start with a classical theory and quantize it.

1:02:47.860 --> 1:02:51.760
 So if we have a classical theory, general relativity, we can quantize it or we can try

1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:57.780
 to, but we run into even bigger problems with gravity than we ran into with electromagnetism.

1:02:57.780 --> 1:03:00.060
 And so far, those problems are insurmountable.

1:03:00.060 --> 1:03:04.980
 We've not been able to get a successful theory of gravity, quantum gravity, by starting with

1:03:04.980 --> 1:03:08.020
 classical general relativity and quantizing it.

1:03:08.020 --> 1:03:12.700
 And there's evidence that, there's a good reason why this is true, that whatever the

1:03:12.700 --> 1:03:17.020
 quantum theory of gravity is, it's not a field theory.

1:03:17.020 --> 1:03:22.300
 It's something that has weird nonlocal features built into it somehow that we don't understand.

1:03:22.300 --> 1:03:27.540
 We get this idea from black holes and Hawking radiation and information conservation and

1:03:27.540 --> 1:03:30.180
 a whole bunch of other ideas I talk about in the book.

1:03:30.180 --> 1:03:34.580
 So if that's true, if the fundamental theory isn't even local in the sense that an ordinary

1:03:34.580 --> 1:03:39.060
 quantum field theory would be, then we just don't know where to start in terms of getting

1:03:39.060 --> 1:03:42.400
 a classical precursor and quantizing it.

1:03:42.400 --> 1:03:46.220
 So the only sensible thing, or at least the next obvious sensible thing to me would be

1:03:46.220 --> 1:03:50.020
 to say, okay, let's just start intrinsically quantum and work backwards, see if we can

1:03:50.020 --> 1:03:51.020
 find a classical limit.

1:03:51.020 --> 1:04:03.900
 So the idea of locality, the fact that locality is not fundamental to the nature of our existence,

1:04:03.900 --> 1:04:07.460
 I guess in that sense, modeling everything as a field makes sense to me.

1:04:07.460 --> 1:04:12.300
 Stuff that's close by interacts, stuff that's far away doesn't.

1:04:12.300 --> 1:04:15.580
 So what's locality and why is it not fundamental?

1:04:15.580 --> 1:04:16.580
 And how is that even possible?

1:04:16.580 --> 1:04:17.580
 Yeah.

1:04:17.580 --> 1:04:21.260
 I mean, locality is the answer to the question that Isaac Newton was worried about back in

1:04:21.260 --> 1:04:22.580
 the beginning of our conversation, right?

1:04:22.580 --> 1:04:27.300
 I mean, how can the earth know what the gravitational field of the sun is?

1:04:27.300 --> 1:04:31.340
 And the answer as spelled out by Laplace and Einstein and others is that there's a field

1:04:31.340 --> 1:04:32.340
 in between.

1:04:32.340 --> 1:04:38.660
 And the way a field works is that what's happening to the field at this point in space only depends

1:04:38.660 --> 1:04:41.580
 directly on what's happening at points right next to it.

1:04:41.580 --> 1:04:45.180
 But what's happening at those points depends on what's happening right next to those, right?

1:04:45.180 --> 1:04:50.620
 And so you can build up an influence across space through only local interactions.

1:04:50.620 --> 1:04:51.860
 That's what locality means.

1:04:51.860 --> 1:04:54.780
 What happens here is only affected by what's happening right next to it.

1:04:54.780 --> 1:04:57.000
 That's locality.

1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:01.460
 The idea of locality is built into every field theory, including general relativity as a

1:05:01.460 --> 1:05:03.100
 classical theory.

1:05:03.100 --> 1:05:07.340
 It seems to break down when we talk about black holes and, you know, Hawking taught

1:05:07.340 --> 1:05:12.520
 us in the 1970s that black holes radiate, they give off, they eventually evaporate away.

1:05:12.520 --> 1:05:17.180
 They're not completely black once we take quantum mechanics into account.

1:05:17.180 --> 1:05:22.540
 And we think, we don't know for sure, but most of us think that if you make a black

1:05:22.540 --> 1:05:28.380
 hole out of certain stuff, then like Laplace's demon taught us, you should be able to predict

1:05:28.380 --> 1:05:32.660
 what that black hole will turn into if it's just obeying the Schrodinger equation.

1:05:32.660 --> 1:05:37.820
 And if that's true, there are good arguments that can't happen while preserving locality

1:05:37.820 --> 1:05:38.820
 at the same time.

1:05:38.820 --> 1:05:44.180
 It's just that the information seems to be spread out nonlocally in interesting ways.

1:05:44.180 --> 1:05:49.540
 And people should, you talk about holography with the Leonard Susskind on your Mindscape

1:05:49.540 --> 1:05:50.540
 podcast.

1:05:50.540 --> 1:05:51.540
 Oh yes, I have a podcast.

1:05:51.540 --> 1:05:52.540
 I didn't even mention that.

1:05:52.540 --> 1:05:53.540
 This is terrible.

1:05:53.540 --> 1:05:57.340
 No, I'm going to, I'm going to ask you questions about that too, and I've been not shutting

1:05:57.340 --> 1:05:58.340
 up about it.

1:05:58.340 --> 1:05:59.340
 It's my favorite science podcast.

1:05:59.340 --> 1:06:02.900
 So, or not, it's a, it's not even a science podcast.

1:06:02.900 --> 1:06:06.140
 It's like, it's a scientist doing a podcast.

1:06:06.140 --> 1:06:07.140
 That's right.

1:06:07.140 --> 1:06:08.140
 That's what it is.

1:06:08.140 --> 1:06:09.140
 Yeah.

1:06:09.140 --> 1:06:10.140
 Anyway.

1:06:10.140 --> 1:06:11.140
 Yeah.

1:06:11.140 --> 1:06:14.580
 So holography is this idea when you have a black hole and black hole is a region of space

1:06:14.580 --> 1:06:17.580
 inside of which gravity is so strong that you can't escape.

1:06:17.580 --> 1:06:21.980
 And there's this weird feature of black holes that, again, it's totally a thought experiment

1:06:21.980 --> 1:06:24.520
 feature because we haven't gone and probed any yet.

1:06:24.520 --> 1:06:29.960
 But there seems to be one way of thinking about what happens inside a black hole as

1:06:29.960 --> 1:06:33.660
 seen by an observer who's falling in, which is actually pretty normal.

1:06:33.660 --> 1:06:37.020
 Like everything looks pretty normal until you hit the singularity and you die.

1:06:37.020 --> 1:06:41.380
 But from the point of view of the outside observer, it seems like all the information

1:06:41.380 --> 1:06:47.460
 that fell in is actually smeared over the horizon in a nonlocal way.

1:06:47.460 --> 1:06:51.660
 And that's puzzling and that's, so holography because that's a two dimensional surface that

1:06:51.660 --> 1:06:55.420
 is encapsulating the whole three dimensional thing inside, right?

1:06:55.420 --> 1:06:56.420
 Still trying to deal with that.

1:06:56.420 --> 1:06:58.100
 Still trying to figure out how to get there.

1:06:58.100 --> 1:07:01.340
 But it's an indication that we need to think a little bit more subtly when we quantize

1:07:01.340 --> 1:07:02.340
 gravity.

1:07:02.340 --> 1:07:07.460
 And because you can describe everything that's going on in the three dimensional space by

1:07:07.460 --> 1:07:13.900
 looking at the two dimensional projection of it, it means that locality doesn't, it's

1:07:13.900 --> 1:07:14.900
 not necessary.

1:07:14.900 --> 1:07:18.900
 Well, it means that somehow it's only a good approximation.

1:07:18.900 --> 1:07:20.380
 It's not really what's going on.

1:07:20.380 --> 1:07:22.020
 How are we supposed to feel about that?

1:07:22.020 --> 1:07:25.700
 We're supposed to feel liberated.

1:07:25.700 --> 1:07:29.680
 You know, space is just a good approximation and this was always going to be true once

1:07:29.680 --> 1:07:31.680
 you started quantizing gravity.

1:07:31.680 --> 1:07:38.820
 So we're just beginning now to face up to the dramatic implications of quantizing gravity.

1:07:38.820 --> 1:07:43.780
 Is there other weird stuff that happens to quantum mechanics in black hole?

1:07:43.780 --> 1:07:47.020
 I don't think that anything weird has happened with quantum mechanics.

1:07:47.020 --> 1:07:48.620
 I think weird things happen with space time.

1:07:48.620 --> 1:07:49.620
 I mean, that's what it is.

1:07:49.620 --> 1:07:53.680
 Like quantum mechanics is still just quantum mechanics, but our ordinary notions of space

1:07:53.680 --> 1:07:57.620
 time don't really quite work.

1:07:57.620 --> 1:08:03.940
 And there's a principle that goes hand in hand with holography called complementarity,

1:08:03.940 --> 1:08:10.540
 which says that there's no one unique way to describe what's going on inside a black

1:08:10.540 --> 1:08:11.540
 hole.

1:08:11.540 --> 1:08:17.220
 Different observers will have different descriptions, both of which are accurate, but sound completely

1:08:17.220 --> 1:08:18.640
 incompatible with each other.

1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:20.900
 So depends on how you look at it.

1:08:20.900 --> 1:08:25.060
 The word complementarity in this context is borrowed from Niels Bohr, who points out you

1:08:25.060 --> 1:08:28.260
 can measure the position or you can measure the momentum.

1:08:28.260 --> 1:08:30.900
 You can't measure both at the same time in quantum mechanics.

1:08:30.900 --> 1:08:34.900
 So a couple of questions on many worlds.

1:08:34.900 --> 1:08:40.740
 How does many worlds help us understand our particular branch of reality?

1:08:40.740 --> 1:08:45.100
 So okay, that's fine and good that is everything is splitting, but we're just traveling down

1:08:45.100 --> 1:08:46.220
 a single branch of it.

1:08:46.220 --> 1:08:50.780
 So how does it help us understand our little unique branch?

1:08:50.780 --> 1:08:52.840
 Yeah, I mean, that's a great question.

1:08:52.840 --> 1:08:56.260
 But that's the point is that we didn't invent many worlds because we thought it was cool

1:08:56.260 --> 1:08:57.820
 to have a whole bunch of worlds, right?

1:08:57.820 --> 1:09:02.700
 We invented it because we were trying to account for what we observe here in our world.

1:09:02.700 --> 1:09:07.500
 And what we observe here in our world are wave functions collapsing, okay?

1:09:07.500 --> 1:09:11.500
 We do have a position, a situation where the electron seems to be spread out.

1:09:11.500 --> 1:09:13.380
 But then when we look at it, we don't see it spread out.

1:09:13.380 --> 1:09:15.100
 We see it located somewhere.

1:09:15.100 --> 1:09:16.160
 So what's going on?

1:09:16.160 --> 1:09:17.880
 That's the measurement problem of quantum mechanics.

1:09:17.880 --> 1:09:19.400
 That's what we have to face up to.

1:09:19.400 --> 1:09:22.900
 So many worlds is just a proposed solution to that problem.

1:09:22.900 --> 1:09:25.660
 And the answer is nothing special is happening.

1:09:25.660 --> 1:09:30.080
 It's still just the Schrodinger equation, but you have a wave function too.

1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:34.380
 And that's a different answer than would be given in hidden variables or dynamical collapse

1:09:34.380 --> 1:09:36.020
 theories or whatever.

1:09:36.020 --> 1:09:42.100
 So the entire point of many worlds is to explain what we observe, but it tries to explain what

1:09:42.100 --> 1:09:44.280
 we already have observed, right?

1:09:44.280 --> 1:09:48.380
 It's not trying to be different from what we've observed because that would be something

1:09:48.380 --> 1:09:50.240
 other than quantum mechanics.

1:09:50.240 --> 1:09:54.220
 But you know, the idea that there's worlds that we didn't observe that keep branching

1:09:54.220 --> 1:10:00.000
 off is kind of, it's stimulating to the imagination.

1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:08.040
 So is it possible to hop from, you mentioned the branches are independent.

1:10:08.040 --> 1:10:10.260
 Is it possible to hop from one to the other?

1:10:10.260 --> 1:10:11.260
 No.

1:10:11.260 --> 1:10:14.180
 So it's a physical limit.

1:10:14.180 --> 1:10:16.260
 The theory says it's impossible.

1:10:16.260 --> 1:10:18.620
 There's already a copy of you in the other world, don't worry.

1:10:18.620 --> 1:10:19.620
 Yes.

1:10:19.620 --> 1:10:20.620
 Leave them alone.

1:10:20.620 --> 1:10:28.780
 No, but there's a fear of missing out, FOMO, that I feel like immediately start to wonder

1:10:28.780 --> 1:10:32.900
 if that other copy is having more or less fun.

1:10:32.900 --> 1:10:38.620
 Well, the downside to many worlds is that you're missing out on an enormous amount.

1:10:38.620 --> 1:10:40.460
 And that's always what it's going to be like.

1:10:40.460 --> 1:10:44.380
 And I mean, there's a certain stage of acceptance in that.

1:10:44.380 --> 1:10:49.980
 In terms of rewinding, do you think we can rewind the system back, sort of the nice thing

1:10:49.980 --> 1:10:58.800
 about many worlds, I guess, is it really emphasizes the, maybe you can correct me, but the deterministic

1:10:58.800 --> 1:11:05.700
 nature of a branch and it feels like it could be rewound back.

1:11:05.700 --> 1:11:11.900
 Is it, do you see it as something that could be perfectly rewound back, rewinding back?

1:11:11.900 --> 1:11:12.900
 Yeah.

1:11:12.900 --> 1:11:17.060
 If you're at a fancy French restaurant and there's a nice linen white tablecloth and

1:11:17.060 --> 1:11:22.620
 you have your glass of Bordeaux and you knock it over and the wine spills across the tablecloth.

1:11:22.620 --> 1:11:28.440
 If the world were classical, okay, it would be possible that if you just lifted the wine

1:11:28.440 --> 1:11:33.020
 glass up, you'd be lucky enough that every molecule of wine would hop back into the glass,

1:11:33.020 --> 1:11:34.020
 right?

1:11:34.020 --> 1:11:35.020
 But guess what?

1:11:35.020 --> 1:11:37.100
 It's not going to happen in the real world.

1:11:37.100 --> 1:11:40.020
 And the quantum wave function is exactly the same way.

1:11:40.020 --> 1:11:44.540
 It is possible in principle to rewind everything if you start from perfect knowledge of the

1:11:44.540 --> 1:11:46.820
 entire wave function of the universe.

1:11:46.820 --> 1:11:49.320
 In practice, it's never going to happen.

1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:53.020
 So time travel, not possible.

1:11:53.020 --> 1:11:54.020
 Nope.

1:11:54.020 --> 1:11:57.760
 At least quantum mechanics has no help.

1:11:57.760 --> 1:12:00.540
 What about memory?

1:12:00.540 --> 1:12:07.720
 Does the universe have a memory of itself where we could, in, in, so not time travel,

1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:13.100
 but peek back in time and do a little like replay?

1:12:13.100 --> 1:12:18.100
 Well, it's exactly the same in quantum mechanics as classical mechanics.

1:12:18.100 --> 1:12:22.540
 So whatever you want to say about that, you know, the fundamental laws of physics in either

1:12:22.540 --> 1:12:28.100
 many worlds, quantum mechanics or Newtonian physics conserve information.

1:12:28.100 --> 1:12:32.620
 So if you have all the information about the quantum state of the world right now, your

1:12:32.620 --> 1:12:37.500
 Laplace is demon like in your knowledge and calculational capacity, you can wind the clock

1:12:37.500 --> 1:12:38.500
 backward.

1:12:38.500 --> 1:12:39.500
 But none of us is.

1:12:39.500 --> 1:12:40.500
 Right?

1:12:40.500 --> 1:12:42.380
 And, you know, so in practice you can never do that.

1:12:42.380 --> 1:12:46.020
 You can do experiments over and over again, starting from the same initial conditions

1:12:46.020 --> 1:12:47.860
 for small systems.

1:12:47.860 --> 1:12:51.780
 But once things get to be large, Avogadro's number of particles, right?

1:12:51.780 --> 1:12:54.960
 Bigger than a cell, no chance.

1:12:54.960 --> 1:13:00.780
 We we've talked a little bit about arrow of time last time, but in many worlds that there

1:13:00.780 --> 1:13:07.520
 is a kind of implied arrow of time, right?

1:13:07.520 --> 1:13:14.480
 So you've talked about the arrow of time that has to do with the second law of thermodynamics.

1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:18.340
 That's the arrow of time that's emergent or fundamental.

1:13:18.340 --> 1:13:19.340
 We don't know, I guess.

1:13:19.340 --> 1:13:20.340
 No, it's emergent.

1:13:20.340 --> 1:13:23.340
 Is that, does everyone agree on that?

1:13:23.340 --> 1:13:25.380
 Well, nobody agrees with everything.

1:13:25.380 --> 1:13:26.380
 They should.

1:13:26.380 --> 1:13:28.300
 They should.

1:13:28.300 --> 1:13:34.000
 So that arrow of time, is that different than the arrow of time that's implied by many worlds?

1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:35.420
 It's not different, actually, no.

1:13:35.420 --> 1:13:40.940
 In both cases, you have fundamental laws of physics that are completely reversible.

1:13:40.940 --> 1:13:45.040
 If you give me the state of the universe at one moment in time, I can run the clock forward

1:13:45.040 --> 1:13:46.360
 or backward equally well.

1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:51.360
 There's no arrow of time built into the laws of physics at the most fundamental level.

1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:57.920
 But what we do have are special initial conditions 14 billion years ago near the Big Bang.

1:13:57.920 --> 1:14:03.520
 In thermodynamics, those special initial conditions take the form of things were low entropy and

1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:08.480
 entropy has been increasing ever since, making the universe more disorganized and chaotic

1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:10.540
 and that's the arrow of time.

1:14:10.540 --> 1:14:15.080
 In quantum mechanics, the special initial conditions take the form of there was only

1:14:15.080 --> 1:14:20.140
 one branch of the wave function and the universe has been branching more and more ever since.

1:14:20.140 --> 1:14:28.540
 Okay, so if time is emergent, so it seems like our human cognitive capacity likes to

1:14:28.540 --> 1:14:33.200
 take things that are emergent and assume and feel like they're fundamental.

1:14:33.200 --> 1:14:42.600
 So what, so if time is emergent and locality, like is space emergent?

1:14:42.600 --> 1:14:43.600
 Yes.

1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:44.600
 Okay.

1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:46.820
 But I didn't say time was emergent, I said the arrow of time was emergent.

1:14:46.820 --> 1:14:47.820
 Those are different.

1:14:47.820 --> 1:14:52.560
 What's the difference between the arrow of time and time?

1:14:52.560 --> 1:14:56.920
 Are you using arrow of time to simply mean this, they're synonymous with the second law

1:14:56.920 --> 1:14:57.920
 of thermodynamics?

1:14:57.920 --> 1:15:01.520
 No, but the arrow of time is the difference between the past and future.

1:15:01.520 --> 1:15:04.500
 So there's space, but there's no arrow of space.

1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:06.920
 You don't feel that space has to have an arrow, right?

1:15:06.920 --> 1:15:10.700
 You could live in thermodynamic equilibrium, there'd be no arrow of time, but there'd still

1:15:10.700 --> 1:15:11.700
 be time.

1:15:11.700 --> 1:15:14.740
 There'd still be a difference between now and the future or whatever.

1:15:14.740 --> 1:15:19.000
 So if nothing changes, there's still time.

1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:23.760
 Well things could even change, like if the whole universe consisted of the earth going

1:15:23.760 --> 1:15:29.440
 around the sun, it would just go in circles or ellipses, right?

1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:32.560
 Things would change, but it's not increasing entropy, there's no arrow.

1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:38.900
 If you took a movie of that and I played you the movie backward, you would never know.

1:15:38.900 --> 1:15:45.680
 So the arrow of time can theoretically point in the other direction for briefly.

1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:49.000
 To the extent that it points in different directions, it's not a very good arrow.

1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:53.520
 I mean, the arrow of time in the macroscopic world is so powerful that there's just no

1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:55.000
 chance of going back.

1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:58.680
 When you get down to tiny systems with only three or four moving parts, then entropy can

1:15:58.680 --> 1:16:00.480
 fluctuate up and down.

1:16:00.480 --> 1:16:03.440
 What does it mean for space to be an emergent phenomenon?

1:16:03.440 --> 1:16:07.280
 It means that the fundamental description of the world does not include the word space.

1:16:07.280 --> 1:16:10.920
 It'll be something like a vector in Hilbert space, right, and you have to say, well why

1:16:10.920 --> 1:16:16.380
 is there a good approximate description which involves three dimensional space and stuff

1:16:16.380 --> 1:16:17.380
 inside it?

1:16:17.380 --> 1:16:21.200
 Okay, so time and space are emergent.

1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:28.620
 We kind of mentioned in the beginning, can you elaborate, what do you feel hope is fundamental

1:16:28.620 --> 1:16:30.400
 in our universe?

1:16:30.400 --> 1:16:32.160
 A wave function living in Hilbert space.

1:16:32.160 --> 1:16:36.960
 A wave function in Hilbert space that we can't intellectualize or visualize really.

1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:40.160
 We can't visualize it, we can intellectualize it very easily.

1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:42.240
 Like how do you think about?

1:16:42.240 --> 1:16:45.560
 It's a vector in a 10 to the 10 to the 122 dimensional vector space.

1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:50.920
 It's a complex vector, unit norm, it evolves according to the Schrodinger equation.

1:16:50.920 --> 1:16:52.420
 Got it.

1:16:52.420 --> 1:16:53.880
 When you put it that way.

1:16:53.880 --> 1:16:56.880
 What's so hard, really?

1:16:56.880 --> 1:17:04.440
 It's like, yep, quantum computers, there's some excitement, actually a lot of excitement

1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:10.640
 with people that it will allow us to simulate quantum mechanical systems.

1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:14.680
 What kind of questions do you about quantum mechanics, about the things we've been talking

1:17:14.680 --> 1:17:21.720
 about, do you think, do you hope we can answer through quantum simulation?

1:17:21.720 --> 1:17:26.340
 Well I think that there are, there's a whole fascinating frontier of things you can do

1:17:26.340 --> 1:17:27.640
 with quantum computers.

1:17:27.640 --> 1:17:37.400
 Both sort of practical things with cryptography or money, privacy eavesdropping, sorting things,

1:17:37.400 --> 1:17:40.280
 simulating quantum systems, right?

1:17:40.280 --> 1:17:44.800
 So it's a broader question maybe even outside of quantum computers.

1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:49.960
 Some of the theories that we've been talking about, what's your hope, what's most promising

1:17:49.960 --> 1:17:52.160
 to test these theories?

1:17:52.160 --> 1:17:57.620
 What are kind of experiments we can conduct, whether in simulation or in the physical world

1:17:57.620 --> 1:18:03.160
 that would validate or disprove or expand these theories?

1:18:03.160 --> 1:18:06.840
 Well I think for, there's two parts of that question.

1:18:06.840 --> 1:18:10.300
 One is many worlds and the other one is sort of emergent space time.

1:18:10.300 --> 1:18:14.280
 For many worlds, you know, there are experiments ongoing to test whether or not wave functions

1:18:14.280 --> 1:18:17.480
 spontaneously collapse.

1:18:17.480 --> 1:18:21.660
 And if they do, then that rules out many worlds and that would be falsified.

1:18:21.660 --> 1:18:27.400
 If there are hidden variables, there's a theorem that seems to indicate that the predictions

1:18:27.400 --> 1:18:29.800
 will always be the same as many worlds.

1:18:29.800 --> 1:18:31.240
 I'm a little skeptical of this theorem.

1:18:31.240 --> 1:18:32.240
 I'm not complete.

1:18:32.240 --> 1:18:33.240
 I haven't internalized it.

1:18:33.240 --> 1:18:36.680
 I haven't made it in part of my intuitive view of the world yet, so there might be loopholes

1:18:36.680 --> 1:18:37.680
 to that theorem.

1:18:37.680 --> 1:18:38.680
 I'm not sure about that.

1:18:38.680 --> 1:18:42.080
 Part of me thinks that there should be different experimental predictions if there are hidden

1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:45.180
 variables, but I'm not sure.

1:18:45.180 --> 1:18:47.320
 But otherwise, it's just quantum mechanics all the way down.

1:18:47.320 --> 1:18:53.120
 And so there's this cottage industry in science journalism of writing breathless articles

1:18:53.120 --> 1:18:57.840
 that say, you know, quantum mechanics shown to be more astonishing than ever before thought.

1:18:57.840 --> 1:19:01.840
 And really, it's the same quantum mechanics we've been doing since 1926.

1:19:01.840 --> 1:19:06.000
 Whereas with the emergent space time stuff, we know a lot less about what the theory is.

1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:07.760
 It's in a very primitive state.

1:19:07.760 --> 1:19:13.880
 We don't even really have a safely written down, respectable, honest theory yet.

1:19:13.880 --> 1:19:17.460
 So there could very well be experimental predictions we just don't know about yet.

1:19:17.460 --> 1:19:20.200
 That is one of the things that we're trying to figure out.

1:19:20.200 --> 1:19:24.320
 Yeah, for emergent space time, you need really big stuff, right?

1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:27.800
 Well, or really fast stuff, or really energetic stuff.

1:19:27.800 --> 1:19:28.800
 We don't know.

1:19:28.800 --> 1:19:29.800
 That's the thing.

1:19:29.800 --> 1:19:34.440
 You know, so there could be violations of the speed of light if you have emergent space

1:19:34.440 --> 1:19:35.860
 time.

1:19:35.860 --> 1:19:39.240
 Not going faster than the speed of light, but the speed of light could be different

1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:42.320
 for light of different wavelengths, right?

1:19:42.320 --> 1:19:46.840
 That would be a dramatic violation of physics as we know it, but it could be possible.

1:19:46.840 --> 1:19:47.840
 Or not.

1:19:47.840 --> 1:19:48.840
 I mean, it's not an absolute prediction.

1:19:48.840 --> 1:19:49.840
 That's the problem.

1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:54.080
 The theories are just not well developed enough yet to say.

1:19:54.080 --> 1:20:01.120
 Is there anything that quantum mechanics can teach us about human nature or the human mind?

1:20:01.120 --> 1:20:06.820
 If you think about sort of consciousness and these kinds of topics, is there...

1:20:06.820 --> 1:20:10.320
 It's certainly excessively used, as you point out.

1:20:10.320 --> 1:20:15.520
 The word quantum is used for everything besides quantum mechanics.

1:20:15.520 --> 1:20:23.600
 But in more seriousness, is there something that goes to the human level and can help

1:20:23.600 --> 1:20:27.280
 us understand our mind?

1:20:27.280 --> 1:20:29.680
 Not really is the short answer, you know.

1:20:29.680 --> 1:20:31.400
 Minds are pretty classical.

1:20:31.400 --> 1:20:32.920
 I don't think.

1:20:32.920 --> 1:20:36.600
 We don't know this for sure, but I don't think that phenomena like entanglement are crucial

1:20:36.600 --> 1:20:38.440
 to how the human mind works.

1:20:38.440 --> 1:20:40.160
 What about consciousness?

1:20:40.160 --> 1:20:48.920
 So you mentioned, I think early on in the conversation, you said it would be unlikely,

1:20:48.920 --> 1:20:54.680
 but incredible if sort of the observer is somehow a fundamental part.

1:20:54.680 --> 1:21:01.900
 So observer, not to romanticize the notion, but seems interlinked to the idea of consciousness.

1:21:01.900 --> 1:21:09.040
 So if consciousness, as the panpsychists believe, is fundamental to the universe, is that possible?

1:21:09.040 --> 1:21:10.040
 Is that weight...

1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:11.040
 I mean, every...

1:21:11.040 --> 1:21:12.040
 Everything's possible.

1:21:12.040 --> 1:21:16.920
 Just like Joe Rogan likes to say, it's entirely possible.

1:21:16.920 --> 1:21:17.920
 But okay.

1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:22.960
 But is it on a spectrum of crazy out there?

1:21:22.960 --> 1:21:28.600
 How the statistically speaking, how often do you ponder the possibility that consciousness

1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:32.120
 is fundamental or the observer is fundamental to...

1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:33.120
 Personally don't at all.

1:21:33.120 --> 1:21:34.120
 There are people who do.

1:21:34.120 --> 1:21:37.160
 I'm a thorough physicalist when it comes to consciousness.

1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:41.800
 I do not think that there are any separate mental states or mental properties.

1:21:41.800 --> 1:21:46.000
 I think they're all emergent, just like space time is and space time is hard enough to understand.

1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:51.320
 So the fact that we don't yet understand consciousness is not at all surprising to me.

1:21:51.320 --> 1:21:55.280
 You, as we mentioned, have an amazing podcast called Mindscape.

1:21:55.280 --> 1:22:03.680
 It's as I said, one of my favorite podcasts sort of both for your explanation of physics,

1:22:03.680 --> 1:22:10.520
 which a lot of people love, and when you venture out into things that are beyond your expertise,

1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:18.960
 but it's just a really smart person exploring even questions like morality, for example.

1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:19.960
 It's very interesting.

1:22:19.960 --> 1:22:21.920
 I think you did a solo episode and so on.

1:22:21.920 --> 1:22:28.200
 I mean, there's a lot of really interesting conversations that you have.

1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:34.680
 What are some from memory, amazing conversations that pop to mind that you've had?

1:22:34.680 --> 1:22:36.320
 What did you learn from them?

1:22:36.320 --> 1:22:40.360
 Something that maybe changed your mind or just inspired you or just what did this whole

1:22:40.360 --> 1:22:45.160
 experience of having conversations, what stands out to you?

1:22:45.160 --> 1:22:46.160
 It's an unfair question.

1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:47.160
 Totally unfair.

1:22:47.160 --> 1:22:48.160
 That's okay.

1:22:48.160 --> 1:22:49.160
 That's all right.

1:22:49.160 --> 1:22:54.000
 You know, it's often the ones I feel like the ones I do on physics and closely related

1:22:54.000 --> 1:23:01.160
 science or even philosophy ones are like, I know this stuff and I'm helping people learn

1:23:01.160 --> 1:23:02.160
 about it.

1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:05.900
 But I learn more from the ones that have nothing to do with physics or philosophy, right?

1:23:05.900 --> 1:23:12.160
 So talking to Wynton Marsalis about jazz or talking to a Master Sommelier about wine,

1:23:12.160 --> 1:23:18.760
 talking to Will Wilkinson about partisan polarization and the urban rural divide, talking to psychologists

1:23:18.760 --> 1:23:26.320
 like Carol Tavris about cognitive dissonance and how those things work.

1:23:26.320 --> 1:23:31.160
 Scott Derrickson who is the director of the movie Dr. Strange, I had a wonderful conversation

1:23:31.160 --> 1:23:36.680
 with him where we went through the mechanics of making a blockbuster superhero movie, right?

1:23:36.680 --> 1:23:41.440
 And he's also not a naturalist, he's an evangelical Christian so we talked about the nature of

1:23:41.440 --> 1:23:42.440
 reality there.

1:23:42.440 --> 1:23:51.360
 I want to have a couple more, you know, discussions with highly educated theists who know the

1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:56.600
 theology really well but I haven't quite arranged those yet.

1:23:56.600 --> 1:23:57.600
 I would love to hear that.

1:23:57.600 --> 1:24:02.520
 I mean that's, how comfortable are you venturing into questions of religion?

1:24:02.520 --> 1:24:04.960
 Oh, I'm totally comfortable doing it.

1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:10.320
 You know, I did talk with Alan Lightman who is also an atheist but he, you know, he is

1:24:10.320 --> 1:24:18.600
 trying to rescue the sort of spiritual side of things for atheism and I did talk to very

1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:23.280
 vocal atheists like Alex Rosenberg so I need to talk to some, I've talked to some religious

1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:26.360
 believers but I need to talk to more.

1:24:26.360 --> 1:24:31.320
 How have you changed through having all these conversations?

1:24:31.320 --> 1:24:35.360
 You know, part of the motivation was I had a long stack of books that I hadn't read and

1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:38.880
 I couldn't find time to read them and I figured if I interviewed their authors, forced me

1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:42.080
 to read them, right, and that has totally worked by the way.

1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:45.680
 Now I'm annoyed that people write such long books.

1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:49.360
 I think I'm still very much learning how to be a good interviewer.

1:24:49.360 --> 1:24:54.520
 I think that's a skill that, you know, I think I have good questions but, you know, there's

1:24:54.520 --> 1:24:58.920
 the give and take that is still I think I can be better at.

1:24:58.920 --> 1:25:02.480
 Like I want to offer something to the conversation but not too much, right?

1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:06.000
 I've had conversations where I barely talked at all and I have conversations where I talked

1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:09.000
 half the time and I think there's a happy medium in between there.

1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:13.720
 So I think I remember listening to, without mentioning names, some of your conversations

1:25:13.720 --> 1:25:16.480
 where I wish you would have disagreed more.

1:25:16.480 --> 1:25:20.400
 As a listener, it's more fun sometimes.

1:25:20.400 --> 1:25:24.960
 Well, that's a very good question because, you know, everyone has an attitude toward

1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:25.960
 that.

1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:32.720
 Like some people are really there to basically give their point of view and their guest is

1:25:32.720 --> 1:25:35.480
 supposed to, you know, respond accordingly.

1:25:35.480 --> 1:25:41.400
 I want to sort of get my view on the record but I don't want to dwell on it when I'm talking

1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:44.120
 to someone like David Chalmers who I disagree with a lot.

1:25:44.120 --> 1:25:48.860
 You know, I want to say like, here's why I disagree with you but, you know, we're here

1:25:48.860 --> 1:25:49.980
 to listen to you.

1:25:49.980 --> 1:25:53.240
 Like I have an episode every week and you're only on once a week, right?

1:25:53.240 --> 1:26:00.760
 So I have an upcoming podcast episode with Philip Goff who is a much more dedicated pan

1:26:00.760 --> 1:26:02.640
 psychist and so there we really get into it.

1:26:02.640 --> 1:26:06.680
 I think that I probably have disagreed with him more on that episode than I ever have

1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:10.240
 with another podcast guest but that's what he wanted so it worked very well.

1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:11.240
 Yeah, yeah.

1:26:11.240 --> 1:26:15.880
 That kind of debate structure is beautiful when it's done right.

1:26:15.880 --> 1:26:21.400
 Like when you're, when you can detect that the intent is that you have fundamental respect

1:26:21.400 --> 1:26:22.400
 for the person.

1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:23.400
 Yeah.

1:26:23.400 --> 1:26:29.040
 That, and that's, for some reason, it's super fun to listen to when two really smart people

1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:32.920
 are just arguing and sometimes lose their shit a little bit if I may say so.

1:26:32.920 --> 1:26:39.160
 Well, there's a fine line because I have zero interest in bringing, I mean, like, I mean,

1:26:39.160 --> 1:26:43.280
 maybe you implied this, I have zero interest in bringing on people for whom I don't have

1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:44.600
 any intellectual respect.

1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:49.120
 Like I constantly get requests like, you know, bring on a flat earther or whatever and really

1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:52.800
 slap them down or a creationist, like I have zero interest.

1:26:52.800 --> 1:26:56.800
 I'm happy to bring on, you know, a religious person, a believer, but I want someone who's

1:26:56.800 --> 1:27:02.160
 smart and can act in good faith and can talk, not a charlatan or a lunatic, right?

1:27:02.160 --> 1:27:08.160
 So I will only, I will happily bring on people with whom I disagree, but only people from

1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:10.320
 whom I think the audience can learn something interesting.

1:27:10.320 --> 1:27:15.740
 So let me ask, the idea of charlatan is an interesting idea.

1:27:15.740 --> 1:27:22.920
 You might be more educated on this topic than me, but there's, there's folks, for example,

1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:31.280
 who argue various aspects of evolution sort of try to approach and say that evolution

1:27:31.280 --> 1:27:37.440
 sort of our current theory of evolution has many holes in it, has many flaws.

1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:46.820
 And they argue that I think like Cambridge, Cambrian explosion, which is like a huge added

1:27:46.820 --> 1:27:52.160
 variability of species, doesn't make sense under our current description of evolution

1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:57.520
 and theory of evolution sort of, if you had to, were to have the conversation with people

1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:05.720
 like that, how do you know that they're the difference in outside the box thinkers and

1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:13.080
 people who are fundamentally unscientific and even bordering on charlatans?

1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:15.080
 That's a great question.

1:28:15.080 --> 1:28:19.200
 And you know, the further you get away from my expertise, the harder it is for me to really

1:28:19.200 --> 1:28:21.040
 judge exactly those things.

1:28:21.040 --> 1:28:25.520
 And, you know, yeah, I don't have a satisfying answer for that one because I think the example

1:28:25.520 --> 1:28:30.840
 you use of someone who, you know, believes in the basic structure of natural selection,

1:28:30.840 --> 1:28:35.240
 but thinks that, you know, this particular thing cannot be understood in the terms of

1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:38.360
 our current understanding of Darwinism.

1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:41.560
 That's a perfect edge case where it's hard to tell, right?

1:28:41.560 --> 1:28:45.680
 And I would have, I would try to talk to people who I do respect and who do know things and

1:28:45.680 --> 1:28:50.920
 I would have to, you know, given that I'm a physicist, I know that physicists will sometimes

1:28:50.920 --> 1:28:53.480
 be too dismissive of alternative points of view.

1:28:53.480 --> 1:28:57.320
 I have to take into account that biologists can also be too dismissive of alternative points

1:28:57.320 --> 1:28:58.320
 of view.

1:28:58.320 --> 1:29:00.760
 So, yeah, that's a tricky one.

1:29:00.760 --> 1:29:02.040
 Have you gotten heat yet?

1:29:02.040 --> 1:29:03.040
 I get heat all the time.

1:29:03.040 --> 1:29:09.000
 Like there's always something, I mean, it's hilarious because I do have, I try very hard

1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:12.080
 not to like have the same topic several times in a row.

1:29:12.080 --> 1:29:16.320
 I did have like two climate change episodes, but they were from very different perspectives,

1:29:16.320 --> 1:29:17.320
 but I like to mix it up.

1:29:17.320 --> 1:29:19.040
 That's the whole, that's why I'm having fun.

1:29:19.040 --> 1:29:22.720
 And every time I do an episode, someone says, oh, the person you should really get on to

1:29:22.720 --> 1:29:24.600
 talk about exactly that is this other person.

1:29:24.600 --> 1:29:26.080
 I'm like, well, I don't, but I did that now.

1:29:26.080 --> 1:29:28.080
 I don't want to do that anymore.

1:29:28.080 --> 1:29:30.880
 Well, I hope you keep doing it.

1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:34.240
 You're inspiring millions of people, your books, your podcasts.

1:29:34.240 --> 1:29:36.240
 Sean, it's an honor to talk to you.

1:29:36.240 --> 1:29:37.240
 Thank you so much.

1:29:37.240 --> 1:29:57.680
 Thank you very much, Lex.
