 The following is a conversation with Ryan Schiller, creator of Librex, an anonymous

00:05.520 --> 00:11.440
 discussion feed for college communities starting at first with Yale, then the Ivy Leagues, and now

00:11.440 --> 00:18.560
 adding Stanford and MIT. Their mission is to give students a place to explore ideas and issues

00:18.560 --> 00:24.880
 in a positive way, but with much more personal and intellectual freedom than has defined college

00:24.880 --> 00:31.760
 campuses in recent history. I think this is a very difficult but worthy project. Quick thank you to

00:31.760 --> 00:38.800
 our sponsors, Allform, Magic Spoon, Better Help, and Brave. Click their links to support this

00:38.800 --> 00:46.160
 podcast. As a side note, let me say that Ryan is a young entrepreneur and genuine human being who

00:46.160 --> 00:52.320
 quickly won me over. He's inspiring in many ways, both in the struggle he had to overcome in his

00:52.320 --> 00:58.800
 personal life, but also in the fact that he did not know how to code, but saw a problem in this

00:58.800 --> 01:05.600
 world, in his community, that he cared about, and for that he learned to code and built a solution

01:05.600 --> 01:11.840
 in the best way he knew how. That's an important reminder for us humans. Let us not only complain

01:11.840 --> 01:18.160
 about the problems in the world, let us fix them. I also have to say that there's passion in Ryan's

01:18.160 --> 01:24.160
 eyes for really wanting to make a difference in the world. His story, his effort, gives me hope

01:24.160 --> 01:30.400
 for the future. There is hate in this world, but I believe there's much more love, and I believe

01:30.400 --> 01:36.400
 it's possible to build online platforms that connect us through our common humanity as we

01:36.400 --> 01:44.320
 explore difficult, personal, even painful ideas together. This is the Lex Friedman podcast,

01:44.320 --> 01:51.040
 and here is my conversation with Ryan Shiller. Let's start with the basics. What is Librex?

01:51.600 --> 01:57.200
 What are its founding story and founding principles? And looking to the future,

01:57.200 --> 02:02.960
 what do you hope to achieve with Librex? Sure, let me break that down. So what is Librex? Librex is

02:02.960 --> 02:09.440
 an anonymous discussion feed for college campuses. It's a place where people can have important and

02:09.440 --> 02:14.640
 unfettered discussions and open discourse about topics they care about, ideas that matter,

02:14.640 --> 02:18.800
 and they can do all of that completely anonymously with verified members of their

02:18.800 --> 02:26.480
 college community. And we exist both on each Ivy League campus, and we have an interivy community,

02:26.480 --> 02:34.000
 and actually this week we just opened to MIT and Stanford. No, really? MIT? Yes! So we have

02:34.000 --> 02:40.160
 MIT and Stanford communities, and I expect you to sign up for your MIT account and start posting.

02:40.160 --> 02:46.080
 What are, for people who are not familiar like me actually, which are the Ivy Leagues? Sure,

02:46.080 --> 02:51.440
 so we started at Yale, which is my, I don't know, can you call it alma mater? Because I haven't

02:51.440 --> 02:57.280
 technically graduated. Yeah, what's that called when you're actually still there? My university?

02:57.280 --> 03:02.400
 Yeah, I guess we'll just call it home. That's my home. Educational home. Started at my educational

03:02.400 --> 03:08.240
 home of Yale, and then we moved to, and we could get into the story of this eventually if you'd

03:08.240 --> 03:14.240
 like, and then we went to Dartmouth, and then quarantine hit. We opened to the rest of the

03:14.240 --> 03:20.880
 Ivy League, and now we have, and the Ivy League, for those who don't know, is Harvard, Yale,

03:20.880 --> 03:27.360
 Princeton, Dartmouth, Columbia, Cornell, Brown, and Penn. I got it all in one breath. What's the

03:27.360 --> 03:34.400
 younger side of the league? Penn? No. Columbia. I can't say that on camera. We'll edit it in post.

03:34.400 --> 03:40.160
 I don't know. I'll just say each of all eight of them, and then you can just like get it in.

03:40.160 --> 03:44.240
 Yeah. Penn, Harvard. There's actually a really nice software that people should check out,

03:44.240 --> 03:50.160
 like a service. It's using machine learning really nicely for podcast editing, where you can,

03:50.160 --> 03:56.560
 it learns the voice of the speaker, and it can change the words you said. It's like some deep

03:56.560 --> 04:00.960
 fake stuff. It's deep fake, but for positive applications. It's very interesting. It's like

04:00.960 --> 04:05.120
 the only deep fake positive application I've seen. I have a friend who's obsessed with deep fakes.

04:05.120 --> 04:10.000
 Yeah. What's great about, I think, deep fakes is that it's going to do the opposite of sort of

04:10.000 --> 04:14.960
 what's happening with our culture, where everyone will have plausible deniability. Yeah, exactly. I

04:14.960 --> 04:21.520
 mean, that's the hope for me is there's so many fake things out there that we're going to actually

04:21.520 --> 04:29.120
 be much more skeptical, and think, and take in multiple sources, and actually like reason,

04:29.120 --> 04:34.640
 like use common sense, and use like deep thinking to understand like what is true and what is not.

04:34.640 --> 04:40.000
 Because, you know, we used to have like traditional sources like the New York Times, and all these

04:40.000 --> 04:45.200
 kinds of publications that had a reputation. There are these institutions, and they're the source of

04:45.200 --> 04:50.400
 truth. And when you no longer can trust anything as a source of truth, you start to think on your

04:50.400 --> 04:55.360
 own. That gets part of the individual. That goes, that takes us way back to like where I came from,

04:55.360 --> 05:00.320
 the Soviet Union, where you can't really trust any one source of news. You have to think on your own.

05:00.320 --> 05:04.960
 You have to talk to your friends. Tremendous amount of intellectual autonomy, don't you think?

05:04.960 --> 05:10.880
 Think about the societal consequences. Absolutely. I mean, we see so much decentralization in all

05:10.880 --> 05:18.720
 aspects of our digital lives now, but this is like the decentralization of thought. Yes. You

05:18.720 --> 05:25.600
 could say it's sadly, or I don't think it's sad, is decentralization of truth, where like truth is a

05:25.600 --> 05:32.160
 clustering thing, where you have these like this point cloud of people just swimming around, like

05:32.160 --> 05:39.280
 billions of them, and they all have certain ideas. And what's thought of as truth is almost like a

05:39.280 --> 05:44.160
 clustering algorithm. When you just get a bunch of people that believe the same thing, that's truth.

05:44.160 --> 05:49.680
 But there's also another truth, and there may be like multiple truths, and it's almost will be like

05:49.680 --> 05:57.760
 a battle of truths. Maybe even the idea of truth will like lessen its power in society that there

05:57.760 --> 06:04.400
 is such a thing as a truth. Because like the downside of saying something is true is it's almost

06:04.400 --> 06:11.040
 the downside of what people like religious people call scientism, which is like once science has

06:11.040 --> 06:18.000
 declared something as true, you can't no longer question it. But the reality is science is a

06:18.000 --> 06:23.600
 moving mechanism. You constantly question, you constantly questioning, and maybe truth should be

06:23.600 --> 06:32.960
 renamed as a process, not a final destination. The whole point is to keep questioning, keep questioning,

06:32.960 --> 06:40.080
 keep discovering. Kind of like we're going backwards in time. So like back when people were

06:40.080 --> 06:46.160
 sort of finding their identities and we were less globalized, right? Like people would get together

06:46.160 --> 06:50.960
 and they'd get together around common value system, common morals, and a common place. And those would

06:50.960 --> 06:56.080
 be sort of these clusters of their truth, right? And so we have all these different civilizations

06:56.080 --> 07:01.520
 and societies across the world that created their own truths. We talk about the Jews and the

07:01.520 --> 07:07.440
 Talmud and Torah. We look at Buddhist texts. We can look at all sorts of different truths and how

07:07.440 --> 07:12.240
 many of them get at the same things, but many of them have different ideas or different articulations.

07:12.240 --> 07:17.680
 Yeah, Harari and sapiens, it rewinds that even farther back into like caveman times. That's the

07:17.680 --> 07:22.400
 thing that made us humans special, is who can develop these clusters of ideas, hold them in

07:22.400 --> 07:27.520
 their minds through stories, pass them on to each other, and it grows and grows. And finally, we have

07:27.520 --> 07:37.440
 Bitcoin. Which money is another belief system that has power only because we believe in it.

07:37.440 --> 07:44.000
 And is that truth? I don't know, but it has power. And it's carried in the minds of millions

07:44.000 --> 07:51.680
 and thereby has power. But back to Librex. So what's the founding story? What's the founding

07:51.680 --> 07:58.000
 principles of Librex? Sure. So I was on campus as a freshman, and I was talking to my friends.

07:58.720 --> 08:04.480
 Many of them felt like it was hard to raise your hand in class to ask a question. They really felt

08:04.480 --> 08:08.320
 like even outside the classroom, it was hard to be vulnerable. And the thing you have to understand

08:08.320 --> 08:13.680
 about Yale is it's not that big a place. Everyone knows someone who knows someone who knows you,

08:13.680 --> 08:19.680
 basically. And people come to these schools, first of all, they're home for people, and they want to

08:19.680 --> 08:23.120
 be themselves. They want to feel like they can be authentic. They want to make real friendships.

08:23.120 --> 08:28.960
 And second of all, it's a place where people go for intellectual vitality to explore important

08:28.960 --> 08:35.840
 ideas and to grow as thinkers. And fortunately, due to the culture, my friends expressed that

08:35.840 --> 08:40.640
 it was very difficult to do that. And I felt it, too. And then I couldn't talk to my professors.

08:40.640 --> 08:46.240
 And I remember I talked to one specific global affairs professor, and I was taking his class,

08:46.240 --> 08:50.640
 and his area of expertise was in the Middle Eastern conflict. And I went to him and I said,

08:50.640 --> 08:57.040
 Professor, we're almost finished this class. And we haven't even gotten to sort of the reason I

08:57.040 --> 09:00.400
 originally wanted to take the class was to hear about your perspective on the Middle Eastern

09:00.400 --> 09:04.720
 conflict. Because something I'd learned at Yale, and this is maybe the most important thing,

09:04.720 --> 09:11.600
 but I'll flush it out a bit. Something I've learned at Yale is that you can learn all sorts

09:11.600 --> 09:17.120
 of things from a textbook. And what you kind of go to Yale to do is to get the opinions of the

09:17.120 --> 09:22.080
 experts that go beyond the textbook and to have those more in depth conversations. And so that's

09:22.080 --> 09:26.160
 sort of the added value of going to a place like Yale and taking a course there as opposed to

09:26.160 --> 09:29.040
 just reading a textbook. But also interact with that opinion.

09:29.040 --> 09:34.960
 Exactly. To interact with that opinion, to hear it, to respond to it, to push back on it,

09:34.960 --> 09:39.520
 and to have that with some great minds. And there really are great minds at Yale,

09:39.520 --> 09:43.360
 don't get me wrong. It's still a place of tremendous brilliance.

09:44.800 --> 09:48.960
 So I'm talking to this professor, right? And I'm like, I haven't heard your area of expertise.

09:48.960 --> 09:54.080
 And I'm like, are we going to get to it? What's the deal? And this is during office hours,

09:54.080 --> 09:59.680
 mind you. So we're one on one. He says, Ryan, to be honest, I used to teach this area every

09:59.680 --> 10:04.080
 single year. In fact, I would do a section on it, which is like a small seminar, like breakaway

10:04.080 --> 10:10.000
 from the class where he would talk to the students in small groups and explain his perspective,

10:10.000 --> 10:15.600
 his research and have a real debate about it, like around a Harkness table. And he said,

10:15.600 --> 10:22.800
 I used to do this. And then about two years ago, a student reported me to the school and I realized

10:22.800 --> 10:28.400
 my job was at risk. And I realized the best course of action was basically just not to approach the

10:28.400 --> 10:34.880
 topic. And so now I just don't even mention it. And he's like, you can say whatever you want, but

10:35.760 --> 10:40.000
 I'm not going to be a part of it. And it's a real shame. It's a real loss to

10:40.000 --> 10:45.920
 all of the students who I think came to the school to learn from these brilliant professors.

10:45.920 --> 10:53.920
 In that context of these world experts, the problem seems to be that reporting mechanism

10:54.960 --> 11:01.120
 where there's a disproportionate power to a complaint of a young student, a complaint that

11:01.120 --> 11:08.880
 an idea is painful or an idea is disrespectful to, you know, or ideas creating an unsafe space.

11:10.080 --> 11:15.520
 And the conclusion of that, I mean, I'm not sure what to do with that because it's a

11:15.520 --> 11:23.200
 single reporting, maybe a couple, but that has more power than the idea itself. And that's

11:23.200 --> 11:29.120
 strange. I don't know how to fix that in the administration except to fire everybody. So like

11:29.120 --> 11:34.960
 this is to push back against this storyline that academia is somehow fundamentally broken.

11:35.520 --> 11:42.320
 I think we have to separate a lot of things out. Like one is you have to look at faculty and you

11:42.320 --> 11:51.280
 have to look at the administration. And like at MIT, for example, the administration does, tries

11:51.280 --> 11:57.840
 to do well, but they're the ones that often lack courage. They're often the ones who are the source

11:57.840 --> 12:05.120
 of the problem. When people criticize academia, and I'll just speak to myself, you know, I'm

12:05.120 --> 12:11.760
 willing to take heat for this, is they really are criticizing the administration, not the faculty

12:11.760 --> 12:19.600
 because the faculty oftentimes are the most brilliant, the bolder thinkers that you think.

12:19.600 --> 12:25.200
 Whenever you talk about we need like the truth to be spoken, the faculty are often the ones

12:25.200 --> 12:30.560
 who are in the possession of the deepest truths in their mind in that sense. And they also have

12:30.560 --> 12:37.360
 the capacity to truly educate in the way that you're saying. And so it's not broken, like

12:37.360 --> 12:42.800
 fundamentally, but there's stuff that like needs, that's not working that well. It needs to be fixed.

12:42.800 --> 12:46.240
 You kind of took my words. That's what I thought you were going to ask me if I think the Ivy League

12:46.240 --> 12:50.720
 is broken. That's totally, that's exactly it. So you don't think, yeah. So on the question,

12:50.720 --> 12:55.680
 do you think the Ivy League is broken? Like what, how do you think about it? The academia in general,

12:55.680 --> 13:00.960
 I suppose, but Ivy League still, I think it represents some of the best qualities of academia.

13:00.960 --> 13:05.520
 What more is there to say there? I think the Ivy League is producing tremendous thinkers to this

13:05.520 --> 13:11.840
 day. I think the culture has a lot that can be improved, but I have a lot of faith in the people

13:11.840 --> 13:16.240
 who are in these institutions. I think, like you said, the administration, and I have to be a

13:16.240 --> 13:22.640
 little careful because I've been in some of these committees and I've talked to the administration

13:22.640 --> 13:27.600
 about these sorts of things. I think they have a lot of stakeholders and unfortunately it makes

13:27.600 --> 13:33.200
 it difficult for them to always serve these brilliant faculty and the students in the way

13:33.200 --> 13:38.960
 that they would probably like to. Yeah. Okay. So this is me speaking, right? The administration,

13:38.960 --> 13:43.760
 I know the people, and they're oftentimes the faculty holding positions in these committees,

13:43.760 --> 13:51.760
 right? Yes. But it's in the role of quote unquote service. They're trying to do well.

13:52.880 --> 13:59.520
 They're trying to do good. But I think you could say it's the mechanism is not working,

13:59.520 --> 14:10.560
 but I could also say my personal opinion is they lack courage, and one, courage, and two,

14:12.080 --> 14:19.120
 grace when they walk through the fire. So courage is stepping into the fire,

14:20.400 --> 14:29.040
 and grace when you walk through the fire is like maintaining that like as opposed to being rude

14:29.040 --> 14:33.920
 and insensitive to the lived quote unquote experience of others or like, you know,

14:33.920 --> 14:39.600
 just not eloquent at all. Like as you step in and take the courageous step of talking and saying

14:39.600 --> 14:44.480
 the difficult thing, doing it well, like doing it skillfully. So both of those are important,

14:44.480 --> 14:49.520
 the courage and the skill to communicate difficult ideas, and they often lack them because they

14:49.520 --> 14:56.320
 weren't trained for it, I think. So you can blame the mechanisms that don't, that allow 19, 20 year

14:56.320 --> 15:02.160
 old students to have more power than the entire faculty, or you could just say that the faculty

15:02.160 --> 15:08.000
 need to step up and grow some guts and skill of graceful communication. And really administration.

15:08.960 --> 15:13.360
 Well, yeah. And the administration. That's right. That's the administration.

15:13.360 --> 15:19.440
 Because the faculty are sometimes some of the most brave outspoken people within the bounds

15:19.440 --> 15:29.520
 of their career. Yeah. So that takes a, that's like the founding kind of spark of a fire that

15:30.480 --> 15:35.760
 led you to then say, okay, so how can I help? Yeah. And I explored a lot. I explored a lot

15:35.760 --> 15:41.360
 of options. I wrote many articles to my friends, talked to them, and I realized it sort of needed

15:41.360 --> 15:48.320
 to be a cultural change. Sort of need to be bottom up, grassroots. Something, I knew the energy was

15:48.320 --> 15:54.320
 there because you just look at the most recent institutional assessment from Yale. This was

15:55.040 --> 15:59.840
 basically the number one thing that students, faculty, and alumni all pointed to, to the

15:59.840 --> 16:05.120
 administration was cultivating more conversations on campus and more difficult conversations on

16:05.120 --> 16:16.080
 campus. So the people on campus know it. And you look at a Gallup poll, 61% of students are on

16:16.080 --> 16:23.280
 Ivy League campuses, afraid to speak their minds because of the campus culture. The campus culture

16:23.280 --> 16:28.960
 is causing a sort of freezing effect on discourse. Can you pause on that again? So what percentage

16:28.960 --> 16:35.040
 of students feel afraid to speak their mind? 61% nationally. And then you're talking about,

16:35.040 --> 16:40.800
 you know, places, nothing like the Ivy League where I'd say, I'd imagine it would be even worse

16:40.800 --> 16:47.840
 because of just the way that these communities kind of come about and the sorts of people who

16:47.840 --> 16:53.440
 are attracted or are invited to these sorts of communities. That's nationwide that college

16:53.440 --> 16:58.960
 students, and it's going up, that college students are afraid to say what they believe because of

16:58.960 --> 17:05.360
 their campus climate. So it's a majority. It's not a conservative thing. It's not a liberal thing.

17:05.360 --> 17:08.400
 It's a group thing. We're all feeling it. The majority of us are feeling it.

17:08.400 --> 17:12.320
 And basically just, it doesn't even, you don't even necessarily

17:13.120 --> 17:16.400
 need to have anything to say. You just have a fear.

17:17.040 --> 17:17.600
 That's right.

17:17.600 --> 17:23.520
 So when you're like teaching, you know, metaphor is a really powerful thing to explain,

17:23.520 --> 17:28.240
 you know, and there's just the caution that you feel that's just horrible for humor. Now,

17:28.240 --> 17:34.160
 comedians have the freedom to just talk shit, which is why I really appreciate somebody who's

17:34.160 --> 17:41.600
 been a friend recently, Tim Dillon, who gives zero, pardon my French, fucks about anything,

17:41.600 --> 17:46.960
 which is very liberating, very important person to just tear down the powerful.

17:46.960 --> 17:52.960
 But, you know, inside the academia as an educator, as a teacher, as a professor,

17:52.960 --> 17:57.680
 you don't have the same freedom. So that fear is felt, I guess, by a majority of students.

17:57.680 --> 18:00.880
 And you were getting at something there too, which is that

18:00.880 --> 18:04.480
 if you're afraid to speak metaphorically, if you're afraid to speak imprecisely,

18:05.200 --> 18:10.160
 it can be very difficult to actually think at all and to think to the extremities of what you're

18:10.160 --> 18:15.120
 capable of, because these are the mechanisms we use when we don't have quite the precise

18:15.120 --> 18:20.240
 mathematical language to quite pinpoint what we're talking about yet. This is the beginning. This is

18:20.240 --> 18:26.160
 the creative step that leads to new knowledge. And so that really scares me is that if I'm not

18:26.160 --> 18:30.880
 allowed to sort of excavate these things, these ideas with people in the sort of messy, sloppy way

18:30.880 --> 18:36.160
 that we do as humans when we're first being creative, are we going to be able to continue

18:36.160 --> 18:40.400
 to innovate? Are we going to continue to be able to learn? And that's what really starts to scare me.

18:41.280 --> 18:44.640
 So you've explored a bunch of different ideas. You ordered a bunch of different stuff.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.360
 How did lead bricks come about?

18:47.920 --> 18:53.040
 Basically, it came to me that it had to be kind of a grassroots movement and it had to be something

18:53.040 --> 18:58.720
 that changed culturally. And it had to be relatively personal, people meeting people,

18:58.720 --> 19:05.200
 people finding out that, no, I'm not the only one on campus who feels this way. I feel alone. And

19:05.200 --> 19:10.720
 there are a lot of other people who feel alone. I believe this thing. And it's not as unpopular as

19:10.720 --> 19:17.760
 I thought. Basically, creating heterodoxy of thought. And it's creating that moment where

19:17.760 --> 19:23.120
 you realize that your politics are personal and that your politics are shared by a lot of people

19:23.120 --> 19:30.400
 on campus. And so I just started coding it. I didn't have much coding experience, but went

19:30.400 --> 19:37.920
 headfirst in and figured how hard could it be? I mean, this is really fascinating. So I talked to a

19:37.920 --> 19:44.320
 lot of software engineers, AI people. Obviously, that's where my passion, my interests are.

19:44.320 --> 19:50.720
 My focus has been throughout my life. The fascinating thing about your story, I think it

19:50.720 --> 19:56.880
 should be truly inspiring to people that want to change the world, is that you don't have a

19:56.880 --> 20:05.120
 background in programming. You don't have even maybe a technical background. So you saw a problem,

20:06.160 --> 20:12.320
 you explored different ideas, and then you just decided you're going to learn how to build an app

20:12.320 --> 20:22.480
 without a technical background. That's so bold. That is so beautiful, man. Can you take me through

20:22.480 --> 20:29.120
 the journey of deciding to do that, of learning to program without a programming background,

20:29.120 --> 20:33.680
 and building the app? Detail, how do you start?

20:33.680 --> 20:42.960
 Sure. You want to buy a Mac? I'm just going to go step by step. I'll be as dumb as possible.

20:42.960 --> 20:48.240
 Because it was truly leading by your feet.

20:48.240 --> 20:49.680
 So you need a computer for this?

20:49.680 --> 20:54.800
 Oh, yeah. I had a PC at the time, and I was Android at the time. And I realized it should

20:54.800 --> 21:01.280
 be an iOS app. And so that was a decision. But I knew kids these days, they're always on their

21:01.280 --> 21:08.000
 phone. And I wanted you to be able to say a passing thought in class. You're walking around,

21:08.000 --> 21:11.520
 and you have a thought, and you can express it. Or you're in the dining hall, and you have your

21:11.520 --> 21:14.880
 phone out, you can express it. So it was clear to me it should be an iOS app.

21:14.880 --> 21:18.400
 By the way, Android is great. Definitely check it out.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.880
 We also are now available on Android, but we'll get there,

21:21.760 --> 21:27.920
 for the new Android users from MIT, Stanford, or the Ivy League. So back to how it happened. So I

21:27.920 --> 21:34.400
 realized I need a Mac. So I went out and got a Mac. And I realized I need an iPhone for testing

21:34.400 --> 21:41.600
 eventually. Got an iPhone. So those were the real robot blocks to start with. From there, I mean,

21:41.600 --> 21:45.440
 there's almost too much information out there about programming. And the question is, where

21:45.440 --> 21:52.640
 do you start, and what's going to be useful to you? And my first thought was I should look at some

21:52.640 --> 21:58.080
 Yale classes. But it became very clear, very quickly, that that was not the right place to start.

21:58.080 --> 22:01.440
 That would probably be the right place to start if I wanted to get a job at Amazon,

22:01.440 --> 22:07.760
 but my goal was slightly different. And I definitely had it in mind that what I was

22:07.760 --> 22:11.520
 trying to make was I'm trying to prove out an idea. I'm not trying to make a finished product.

22:11.520 --> 22:18.560
 I'm just trying to get to the first step. Because I figured if I keep getting to the next step,

22:18.560 --> 22:23.440
 at least I won't die now. At least things will move forward. I'll learn new things. Maybe I'll

22:23.440 --> 22:27.920
 meet new people. I'll show a degree of seriousness about what I'm doing. And things will come

22:27.920 --> 22:35.040
 together. And that is, as you'll see, what ends up happening. So I start with Swift. And I find

22:35.040 --> 22:39.360
 this video from the Stanford professor that had a million views that was how to make, basically,

22:39.360 --> 22:46.800
 Swift apps perfect. And you just like, so you got this Mac, and you go to google.com,

22:46.800 --> 22:55.840
 and you type in Xcode. And then I type in on YouTube like Stanford, iOS, Swift, enter.

22:57.040 --> 23:01.200
 First YouTube video has a million views. I'm like, it has to be good at Stanford has a million

23:01.200 --> 23:07.520
 views. I got lucky. I mean, that turned out to be a very good video. It's basically like

23:07.520 --> 23:12.160
 introductory course to Swift. Yeah. I mean, you say introductory. I think most of the people in

23:12.160 --> 23:18.000
 that class probably had a much better background than I did software developers probably computer

23:18.000 --> 23:23.520
 scientists. And it was slow for me. I don't think I realized it fully at the time just how far

23:23.520 --> 23:27.120
 behind I was from the rest of the class because I was like, wow, it seems like people are picking

23:27.120 --> 23:32.800
 this up really quickly. So it took a little longer and you know, a lot of time on Stack Overflow.

23:32.800 --> 23:38.880
 But eventually I made a truly minimal viable product. The most minimal like we're talking,

23:38.880 --> 23:44.560
 you know, put text on screen, add text to screen, comment on top of text, you know,

23:44.560 --> 23:52.000
 make a post, make a response. And anyone with a Yale email can do this. And you plug it into

23:52.720 --> 23:59.600
 a certain cloud server and you verify people's accounts. And you you're off you have to figure

23:59.600 --> 24:05.760
 out how to like the whole idea of like having an account. So there's a permanence like you can

24:05.760 --> 24:12.240
 create an account with an email, verify it, verify it. OK, so that that's not, you know,

24:12.240 --> 24:15.520
 and that's literally how I thought about it. Right. Like, so what do I need to do? And I'm

24:15.520 --> 24:21.120
 like, well, first thing I need is a login page. And I'm like, how to make a login page in Swift.

24:21.920 --> 24:25.520
 I mean, it's that easy. If someone this has been done before, of course. And then the first page

24:25.520 --> 24:30.400
 that pops up is probably a pretty damn good page when it wasn't that bad. It wasn't perfect. But

24:30.400 --> 24:35.920
 like maybe it got me 80 percent of the way there. And then I came into some bugs and then, you know,

24:35.920 --> 24:40.480
 I asked Stack Overflow a few questions and then I got a little further and then I found some more

24:40.480 --> 24:43.680
 bugs. And then I'm like, maybe this isn't the right way to do. Maybe I should do it this way.

24:43.680 --> 24:48.640
 And I'm sure my code isn't great, but the goal isn't to make great code. The goal wasn't to

24:48.640 --> 24:53.760
 make scalable code. It was to understand, is this something my friends will use? Like,

24:53.760 --> 24:58.720
 what is the reaction going to be if I put it in their hands and am I capable of making this thing?

24:58.720 --> 25:04.160
 And that's awesome. And so you're focusing on the experience, like actually just really driving

25:04.160 --> 25:08.560
 towards that first step, figuring out the first step and really driving towards it. Of course,

25:08.560 --> 25:13.680
 you have to also figure out like this concept of like storage, like database.

25:13.680 --> 25:14.640
 You know something funny?

25:14.640 --> 25:15.280
 What's that?

25:15.280 --> 25:19.280
 I just made the database structure with no knowledge of databases whatsoever.

25:19.840 --> 25:23.360
 And I start showing it to my friends who have an experience in CS and they're like,

25:23.360 --> 25:28.320
 you used to heap. That's so interesting. You're like, why did you decide to store it in this way?

25:28.320 --> 25:35.200
 I'm like, bro, I don't even know what a heap is. I just did it because it works. Like I'm trying

25:35.200 --> 25:39.360
 to make calls and stuff. And they're like, yeah, they're like, the hierarchy is really like,

25:39.360 --> 25:40.400
 I'm like, what?

25:40.400 --> 25:44.800
 Well, there's a deep profound lesson in there that I don't know how much you've interacted

25:44.800 --> 25:49.760
 with computer science people since, but they tend to optimize and have these kinds of discussions.

25:49.760 --> 25:55.040
 And what leads, what results is over optimization. It's like worrying, is this really the right way

25:55.040 --> 26:00.080
 to do it? And then you go as opposed to doing the first thing on Stack Overflow, you go down this

26:00.080 --> 26:06.640
 like rabbit hole of what's the actual proper way to do it. And then you're like, you wake up five

26:06.640 --> 26:13.120
 years later working on Amazon because you've never finished the login page. Like it's kind of

26:13.120 --> 26:20.880
 hilarious, but that's a really deep lesson. Like just get it done. And there's like, what's a heap,

26:20.880 --> 26:27.920
 bro? Is the right, that should be a t shirt. That's really the right approach to building something

26:27.920 --> 26:34.720
 that ultimately creates an experience. And then you iterate eventually. That's how the great,

26:34.720 --> 26:39.200
 some of the greatest software products in this world have been built is you create it quickly

26:39.760 --> 26:45.360
 and then just iterate. What was, by the way, in your mind, the thing that you were chasing as a

26:45.360 --> 26:52.960
 prototype? Like what, what was the first step that it feels like something is working? Like did you

26:52.960 --> 27:00.240
 see you interacting with another friend? Yeah. I think the first step was like, it's one thing to

27:00.240 --> 27:04.720
 tell someone about an idea, but it's another thing to put in their hands and kind of see like the way

27:04.720 --> 27:11.760
 their, their eyes kind of look. And when I'd go, I'd walk around cross campus, which is part of

27:11.760 --> 27:15.520
 Yale, and I'd literally just go up to people and run up to them and be like, try this, try this,

27:15.520 --> 27:19.360
 you got to try this. This is pre quarantine, by the way, of course, this would never be the same

27:19.360 --> 27:22.560
 post quarantine, but like, you got to try this, you got to try this. Like, what is it? And I'd be

27:22.560 --> 27:27.520
 like, and I explain it's like an anonymous discussion feed for our Yale campus. And you see

27:27.520 --> 27:32.560
 their gears turning and they just, some people would be like, not interested. I'm like, fine,

27:32.560 --> 27:38.160
 not your target demographic. I get it. You'll come eventually. But some people like you could see it,

27:38.160 --> 27:45.280
 they got it. They're like, yes. And that's when I was like, okay, okay, there is, and you don't need,

27:46.080 --> 27:53.280
 I mean, you don't need 50% of people to like it. You need what, 5%, 10% to love it. And then

27:53.280 --> 28:00.240
 they'll tell 5%, 10%. Yeah, word of mouth. And you're good. Of course, the first version was

28:00.240 --> 28:05.520
 very, very crappy, but seeing people trying despite all the crappiness wasn't, it was sort of enough

28:05.520 --> 28:12.560
 to be the first step. And since then, all of my code has been stripped out. I now have friends

28:12.560 --> 28:17.280
 who basically have told me, don't bother with the coding part. You do the rest. You just make sure

28:17.280 --> 28:22.000
 that we can code because they want to code. Great. I mean, I'm not an engineer. I never intended to

28:22.000 --> 28:27.280
 be an engineer. And there's a lot to do that's not engineering. But the point was just to validate

28:27.280 --> 28:33.760
 the idea, so to speak. When was the moment that you felt like we've created something special?

28:33.760 --> 28:43.120
 Maybe a moment where you're proud of that this is, this has the potential to actually be the very

28:44.320 --> 28:51.120
 implementation of the idea that I initially had. There's so many little moments. It's like,

28:51.120 --> 28:58.080
 and I bet there'll still be moments in the future that make it hard to like totally say, like. Yeah,

28:58.080 --> 29:04.800
 we should say this is, this is still very early days of Librex. It's only been a year since we've

29:04.800 --> 29:09.520
 had like actual, like a lot of people on the app. Yeah. About a year. Oh wow. Okay. I mean,

29:09.520 --> 29:14.000
 there's some crazy moments I could talk about sort of going to Dartmouth because it's one thing to

29:14.000 --> 29:20.320
 like get some traction at your school. People know you and you know, it's your school, you know,

29:20.320 --> 29:25.360
 it's another thing to go to another school and where no one knows you and sign up 90% of the

29:25.360 --> 29:31.440
 campus overnight. Wow. So tell me that story. You're invading another territory. It was literally

29:31.440 --> 29:37.840
 like that. Did you buy it like a Dartmouth sweatshirt? Purposefully, I didn't want to fraud

29:37.840 --> 29:43.520
 anyone, but I was purposefully nondescript in my clothing. Yeah. No Yale stuff, no Dartmouth stuff.

29:43.520 --> 29:54.080
 Just blended. I'll go back there. So what happened was this was like March of last year. So almost,

29:54.080 --> 30:00.880
 almost a year ago today. And I really wanted to see if we could go from sort of one campus to two

30:00.880 --> 30:10.160
 campuses. So I didn't know anyone at Dartmouth's campus, but I kind of, I had some cold emails,

30:10.160 --> 30:16.320
 some warmish emails. And I went to people and I was like, basically, can I sleep on your floor for

30:16.320 --> 30:21.120
 two days during finals period? I had a lot of people who said, this is crazy. Like no one's

30:21.120 --> 30:24.960
 going to, no one wants to download an app during finals period, a social app during finals period.

30:26.160 --> 30:31.040
 But I emailed a few people. I was like, you know, can I sleep on your floor? And one of them

30:31.040 --> 30:37.760
 was crazy enough to say, sure, come to my, come to my dorm. I have a nice floor. And he ended up,

30:37.760 --> 30:42.800
 today, he's still really close. He's a really close friend. But anyway, I take a train,

30:42.800 --> 30:50.160
 knowing nothing about this guy besides his first and last name. And I arrive and Dartmouth is

30:50.160 --> 30:56.560
 really, really remote, way more remote than you think to the point where I'm like, he's like,

30:56.560 --> 31:00.480
 he warned me. He's a really hospitable guy. He warned me like, it's going to be hard to get to

31:00.480 --> 31:04.400
 campus from the train station because it's really remote. And I'm like, I'm sure it's fine. I'll

31:04.400 --> 31:09.680
 just get an Uber. There are no Ubers in Hanover. What do you think this is?

31:09.680 --> 31:14.800
 This is New Hampshire. So, Connecticut, I mean, Yale is pretty remote as well, no?

31:14.800 --> 31:21.920
 Yeah. Yale is, well, I mean, Yale is in New Haven, which is a real city. It has Ubers. It has food.

31:21.920 --> 31:26.800
 It has culture. It has a nightclub even. Like, we're talking about a real city. Like, it's not

31:26.800 --> 31:32.880
 New York. It's not Philadelphia, where I'm from, but it's a city. New Hampshire is something very

31:32.880 --> 31:37.840
 different. Yeah. Beautiful campus, I'm sure. Beautiful. Oh, my gosh. I could talk so much

31:37.840 --> 31:42.880
 about, I was blown away by Dartmouth. I started wondering like why I didn't apply.

31:42.880 --> 31:49.680
 Legitimately, between the people and the culture, it was a beautiful vacation. So,

31:49.680 --> 31:54.960
 I arrived there, no Uber, but eventually I call this guy who's like the only guy who can get you

31:54.960 --> 32:00.160
 to Dartmouth and it takes a couple hours, but we get there. I sleep on this guy's floor. I wake up.

32:00.160 --> 32:03.760
 I ask him if there's any printing. He's like, oh, Dartmouth happens to have free printing in

32:03.760 --> 32:10.640
 the copy room. I print out like 2000 posters until the guy in the copy room literally goes to me,

32:10.640 --> 32:14.320
 he's like, kid, I don't know what you're doing, but you need to get out of here. I'm like,

32:15.200 --> 32:20.480
 I'm going, I'm going. I found the limits. Yeah, I found the limit. I think a lot of startups

32:20.480 --> 32:26.400
 about finding the limits. That's a little piece of advice. Socially, he's like, you got to get

32:26.400 --> 32:34.000
 out of here. I then go to every single dorm door. I put a poster under every single dorm door,

32:34.000 --> 32:40.080
 advertising the app with a QR code. I walk around campus saying hi to everyone

32:40.080 --> 32:44.320
 and telling them about the app. I go from table to table in the cafeteria, introduce myself,

32:44.320 --> 32:48.960
 say hi and tell them to download the app. It's an exhausting day. So many steps,

32:48.960 --> 32:53.200
 so many crotching down to slip the poster under the dorm door. My legs were burning.

32:54.640 --> 33:02.320
 But by the end of it, 24 hours later, I'm sitting in a bus and I'm just pressing the refresh button

33:02.320 --> 33:07.600
 on the account creation panels. It's like going up by hundreds. And I'm like, oh my gosh.

33:07.600 --> 33:14.400
 The word of mouth is working in a sense. I mean, certainly your initial seed is powerful.

33:14.400 --> 33:15.360
 Just a piece.

33:15.360 --> 33:20.320
 Yeah, but then the word of mouth is what carries it forward. And what was the explanation you gave

33:20.320 --> 33:26.320
 to the app? Is anonymity a fundamental part of it? Like saying, this is a chance

33:27.280 --> 33:30.960
 for you to speak your mind about your experiences on campus.

33:32.160 --> 33:37.360
 Yeah, I think people get it. What I've realized is you don't need to tell people

33:37.360 --> 33:39.200
 why to try it. They know.

33:40.880 --> 33:42.080
 There's a hunger for this.

33:42.080 --> 33:48.720
 Exactly. So all I do is I'm very factual. I said, and this is where I kind of ended up coining the

33:50.480 --> 33:55.040
 line that I now used to say it because I said it so many times in those 24 hours.

33:55.040 --> 33:59.760
 I just said, it's an anonymous discussion feed for Dartmouth. And they're like, yes.

34:02.480 --> 34:06.320
 Like they've been waiting for it. Some people are more skeptical, but a lot of people were like,

34:06.320 --> 34:11.520
 great, I'm excited to try this. I'm excited to meet people and connect. And I mean,

34:11.520 --> 34:17.040
 the way Dartmouth is taken to is incredible. Everything from professors writing poems during

34:17.040 --> 34:22.160
 finals period to be like, good luck in finals period. You're going to rise like a Phoenix

34:22.160 --> 34:29.040
 or whatever to like, yeah, it's crazy. To I heard about two women meeting on Librex and

34:29.040 --> 34:37.280
 starting a finance club at Dartmouth to significant others meeting. There was an article recently

34:37.280 --> 34:41.840
 written up at Yale as well about two queer women who met on Librex and started a relationship,

34:41.840 --> 34:47.600
 which was pretty, it was pretty interesting to see people throwing parties pre COVID. Yeah.

34:47.600 --> 34:51.440
 It was just amazing to see how, when you allow people to be vulnerable and social,

34:51.440 --> 34:54.960
 they connect. People have this natural desire to connect.

34:54.960 --> 35:00.480
 Yeah. When, when you have, would have a natural desire to have a voice. And then when that voice

35:01.520 --> 35:08.560
 is, is paired with freedom, that you could truly express yourself and there's something

35:08.560 --> 35:14.240
 liberating about that. And in that sense, you're like, you're connecting as your true self,

35:14.240 --> 35:19.040
 whatever that is. What are the most powerful conversation you've seen on the app? You mentioned

35:19.040 --> 35:23.680
 like people connecting. The hard part of that, that is the sorting, you know, figuring out which

35:23.680 --> 35:27.360
 one, which one am I going to put at the top? Mental sorting out. Just something that stands

35:27.360 --> 35:31.600
 out to you. Sorry. I don't mean to do like the top 10 conversations ever of all time,

35:31.600 --> 35:35.280
 ever on the app. I just mean like stuff that you remember that stands out to you.

35:35.280 --> 35:43.040
 I remember this one really amazing comment from this. He was a Mexican international student

35:43.760 --> 35:51.440
 who spoke out and this, this, this post was super edgy, but yet it got hundreds and hundreds of

35:51.440 --> 35:55.040
 upvotes within the Yale community. It was a Yale community specific post. And we should point out

35:55.040 --> 36:00.800
 that there's a school specific community now and there's an all Ivy community. So this was

36:00.800 --> 36:05.840
 specifically in the Yale community. And this was a little while ago, but it stuck with me. This

36:06.560 --> 36:13.040
 Mexican international student comes to Yale and he starts talking about his experience

36:13.040 --> 36:19.120
 in the La Casa, which is the Mexican Latina X as they would say, cultural center at Yale,

36:19.120 --> 36:26.720
 and how he doesn't feel welcome there because he's Roman Catholic basically and international

36:26.720 --> 36:31.680
 and how he doesn't feel like he fits with their agenda. And as a result, this place that's

36:31.680 --> 36:36.240
 supposed to be home for him, he feels outcasted and feels more alone than he does anywhere else

36:36.240 --> 36:42.400
 on campus. That's powerful. That was powerful to me. Yeah. It's hearing someone, someone who should

36:42.400 --> 36:50.240
 be feeling supported by this culture say, actually, this is not doing anything for me. Like this is

36:50.240 --> 36:58.160
 not helping me. This is not where I feel at home. So what do you make of anonymity?

36:59.520 --> 37:06.640
 Because it seems to be a fundamental aspect of the power of the app, right? But at the same time,

37:06.640 --> 37:13.200
 anonymity on the internet, so it protects us, right? It gives us freedom to have a voice,

37:14.000 --> 37:20.080
 but it can also bring out the dark sides of human nature, like trolls or people who want

37:20.080 --> 37:27.680
 to be malicious, want to hurt others purely for the joy of hurting others, being cruel for fun

37:28.320 --> 37:33.600
 and going to the dark places. So like, what do you make of anonymity as a fundamental feature

37:33.600 --> 37:38.960
 of social interaction, like the pros and the cons? Yeah. Just to break that down a bit,

37:38.960 --> 37:42.480
 I would say a lot of those same things about a place like Twitter where people are very

37:42.480 --> 37:49.280
 unanonymous. Having said that, of course, there's a different sort of capacity people have when

37:49.280 --> 37:55.440
 they're anonymous, right? In all different sorts of ways. So what do I make of anonymity? I think

37:55.440 --> 37:59.440
 it can be incredibly liberating and allow people to be incredibly vulnerable and to connect in

37:59.440 --> 38:04.240
 different ways, both on politics, and there was a lot to talk about this year regarding politics,

38:04.880 --> 38:09.680
 and personally being vulnerable, talking about relationships and mental health.

38:10.960 --> 38:13.760
 I think it allows people to have a community that's not performative.

38:14.800 --> 38:21.440
 And of course, there's this other side where people can sometimes break rules or say things

38:21.440 --> 38:25.200
 that they wouldn't otherwise say that people don't always agree with or that people might

38:25.200 --> 38:31.600
 find repugnant. And to an extent, these can facilitate great conversations. And on the other

38:31.600 --> 38:36.000
 hand, we have to have moderation in place, and we have to have community guidelines to make sure

38:36.000 --> 38:42.480
 that the anonymity doesn't overwhelm the purpose, which is that anonymity, first of all, anonymity

38:42.480 --> 38:48.560
 is a tool in Librex. It was not the purpose of Librex. It is a way that we get towards these

38:48.560 --> 38:55.600
 authentic conversations given our campus climate. And second of all, I would say it's a spectrum.

38:57.840 --> 39:05.680
 It's not just Librex is anonymous because Librex isn't totally anonymous. Everyone's a verified

39:05.680 --> 39:11.200
 Ivy League student. You know exactly what school everyone goes to. You only have one account per

39:11.200 --> 39:19.680
 person at Yale. I mean, what that amounts to is people have more of an ownership in the community

39:19.680 --> 39:22.160
 and people know that they're connected and they have a common vernacular.

39:23.040 --> 39:27.840
 So the anonymity is a scale and it's a tool. But you can also trust, I mean, this is the

39:27.840 --> 39:32.560
 difference between Reddit anonymity, where you can easily create multiple accounts.

39:33.920 --> 39:39.840
 When you have only one account per person, or at least it's very difficult to create multiple

39:39.840 --> 39:45.600
 accounts, then you can trust that the anonymous person you're talking to is a human being.

39:45.600 --> 39:46.640
 Not a bot.

39:46.640 --> 39:53.840
 I try to be completely unanonymous now in my all public interactions. I try to be as real in every

39:53.840 --> 39:58.160
 way possible, like zero gap between private me and public me.

39:59.200 --> 40:04.400
 Why exactly did you, it seems like this is an intentional mission. What made you want to sort

40:04.400 --> 40:09.760
 of bridge that gap between the private sphere and public sphere? Because that's unique. I know a

40:09.760 --> 40:12.400
 lot of intellectuals who would make a different decision.

40:13.040 --> 40:18.800
 Yeah, interesting. I had a discussion with Naval about this, actually, with a few others that

40:20.080 --> 40:22.880
 have a very clear distinction between public and private.

40:24.160 --> 40:27.840
 Something I'm struggling with, by the way, personally, and thinking about.

40:27.840 --> 40:40.960
 So one on the very basic surface level is if you carry with yourself lies, small lies or big lies,

40:41.840 --> 40:51.120
 it's extra mental effort to remember what you're supposed to say and not supposed to say.

40:51.920 --> 40:57.680
 So that's on a very surface level of like, it's just easier to live life when you have

40:57.680 --> 41:00.480
 the smaller the gap between the private you and the public you.

41:01.760 --> 41:08.240
 And the second is, I think for me, from an engineering perspective,

41:09.200 --> 41:15.920
 like if I'm dishonest with others, I will too quickly become dishonest with myself.

41:16.880 --> 41:22.080
 And in so doing, I will not truly be able to think deeply about the world and come up

41:22.080 --> 41:26.560
 and build revolutionary ideas. There's something about honesty that feels like

41:26.560 --> 41:31.760
 it's that first principles thinking that's almost like overused as a term, but it feels like that

41:31.760 --> 41:38.160
 requires radical honesty, not radical asshole and lishness, but radical honesty with yourself,

41:38.160 --> 41:44.960
 with yourself. And it feels like it's difficult to be radically honest with yourself when you're

41:44.960 --> 41:52.240
 being dishonest with the public. And also I have a nice feature, honestly, that in this current

41:52.240 --> 41:59.440
 social context, so we can talk about race and gender and what are the other topics that are

41:59.440 --> 42:00.240
 touchy?

41:52.240 --> 42:03.040
 Ethnicity and nationality.

42:03.040 --> 42:04.640
 All those things. I mean, like.

42:04.640 --> 42:05.840
 Family structure.

42:05.840 --> 42:11.840
 Maybe I'm ineloquent in the way I speak about them, but I honestly, when I look in the mirror,

42:12.480 --> 42:19.440
 like I'm not deeply hateful of a particular race or even just hateful particular race.

42:19.440 --> 42:36.720
 I'm sure I'm biased and I've tried to like think about those biases and so on. And also, I don't have any

42:36.720 --> 42:43.680
 creepy shit in my closet. It seems like a lot of people did a lot of creepy stuff in their life.

42:43.680 --> 43:12.800
 I've gotten a bit of a platform. And I think it all started when I went to this female comedian, Whitney

43:12.800 --> 43:42.720
 Brown, and I was like, you know, I really value love, long term monogamy with like one person. And it's like, I

43:42.720 --> 44:06.240
 really value liberating as a human being. Forget public, all that. Because then I feel like I'm on sturdy ground when I say

44:06.240 --> 44:12.240
 difficult things. And at the same time, sorry, I'm ranting on this. I apologize.

44:12.240 --> 44:23.920
 Like I won't be able to fake it. Like they'll see it through. Yeah. So I feel like if you're not

44:23.920 --> 44:30.800
 lying about stuff, you have the freedom to truly be yourself. And the internet will figure it out.

44:30.800 --> 44:35.680
 Like we'll figure who you are. People have a natural tendency to be able to tell bullshit.

44:35.680 --> 44:43.760
 It makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint, right? Exactly. Like why? Why wouldn't, why, like, of all the things that we could evolve to be good at,

44:45.600 --> 44:49.520
 being able to detect honesty seems like one that would be particularly valuable,

44:49.520 --> 44:54.160
 especially in the sorts of societies we developed into. And then also from a selfish perspective,

44:54.160 --> 45:01.360
 like a success perspective, I think there's a lot of folks that have inspired me, like Elon is one of them,

45:01.360 --> 45:09.920
 that shows that there's a hunger for genuineness. Like you can build a business as a CEO and be

45:09.920 --> 45:15.040
 genuine and like real and do stupid shit every once in a while, as long as it's coming from the

45:15.040 --> 45:19.680
 same place of who you truly are. Like Elon is inspirational with that. And then there's a lot of

45:19.680 --> 45:28.080
 other people I admire that are counter inspirations in the sense like they're very formal. They hold

45:28.080 --> 45:33.920
 back a lot of themselves. And it's like, I know how brilliant those people are. And I think they're

45:33.920 --> 45:41.120
 not being as effective of leaders, public faces of companies as they could be. I mean, to be honest,

45:41.120 --> 45:49.520
 like not to throw shade, but I will, it's like Mark Zuckerberg is an example of that. Jack Dorsey is

45:49.520 --> 45:54.000
 also a bit of an example of that. I like Jack a lot. I've talked to him a lot. I will talk to him

45:54.000 --> 46:03.360
 more. I think he's a much more amazing person than he conveys through his public presentation. I think

46:03.360 --> 46:08.400
 a lot of that has to do with PR and marketing people having an effect. This is difficult. I think

46:08.400 --> 46:13.200
 it's really difficult. It's probably many of the same difficulties you will face as the pressures.

46:14.800 --> 46:20.320
 But it's hard to know what to do. But I think as much as possible as an individual, you should try

46:20.320 --> 46:28.800
 to be honest in the face of the world and the company that wants you to be more polished. And

46:28.800 --> 46:33.760
 that being more polished turns you into a politician and politician eventually turns into

46:33.760 --> 46:37.760
 being dishonest. Dishonest with the world and dishonest with yourself.

46:37.760 --> 46:43.360
 Something I noticed, which was of the people you mentioned, those things have had ramifications

46:43.360 --> 46:51.760
 in terms of letting things go too far or get out of hand. And you wonder, it's an aspect of lying,

46:51.760 --> 46:57.920
 right? You say one lie goes to another lie. You push it down. It doesn't matter. You can figure

46:57.920 --> 47:04.000
 it out later. You can figure it out later. Pretty soon, you've dug a pretty big hole. And I think

47:04.000 --> 47:09.440
 if we look at Twitter and we look at Facebook, I think it goes without saying what sorts of holes

47:09.440 --> 47:14.400
 have been dug because of, perhaps because of a lack of honesty that goes all the way up to the

47:14.400 --> 47:20.640
 leaders. So yeah, there's two problems within the company. It doesn't make you as effective of a

47:20.640 --> 47:28.480
 leader, I think. That's one. And two, for social media companies, I think people need to trust,

47:28.480 --> 47:34.000
 like it doesn't have to be the CEO, but it has to be like, this is how humans work. We want to look

47:34.000 --> 47:43.040
 to somebody we're like, I trust you. If you're going to use a social media platform, I think you

47:43.040 --> 47:49.760
 have to trust the set of individuals working at the top of that social. Something I realized

47:49.760 --> 47:55.920
 really quickly, one of the lessons throughout the startup was that people don't totally connect to

47:55.920 --> 48:03.600
 products as much as they connect to people. And I mean, I don't know how much you've spent on

48:03.600 --> 48:11.520
 Librex. You've only been here the last week, but I mean, I love the product. And one of the aspects

48:11.520 --> 48:15.840
 of me loving the product is that I was super active and I've been super active throughout the

48:15.840 --> 48:22.000
 entire time. And the amount of support I've received has made that very easy to do from

48:22.000 --> 48:26.480
 the community and the fact that I could, I mean, so I came to Boston for this interview, right?

48:26.480 --> 48:34.560
 Yeah. I came to Boston. I got off the train. It was around 5.30 PM. I checked Librex. Someone

48:34.560 --> 48:38.800
 is writing, hey, I'm in Boston. Does anyone want to get dinner? 30 minutes later, I'm getting

48:38.800 --> 48:45.440
 dinner with them. That's amazing. And I mean, it's incredible. First of all, as an entrepreneur,

48:46.160 --> 48:52.080
 the amount of stuff I learn from these people and when they reiterate and I hear that they got the

48:52.080 --> 48:57.120
 message through the product. I mean, that's incredibly validating, but also, I mean, I think

48:57.120 --> 49:01.840
 it's just important to be able to put a face to a brand and especially a brand that's built on trust

49:02.960 --> 49:09.440
 because fundamentally the users are trusting us with some really important discussions and some

49:09.440 --> 49:13.840
 really, and a movement to some degree. It's a community and a movement.

49:13.840 --> 49:20.960
 I'll tell you actually why I didn't use the app very much so far is there's something really

49:20.960 --> 49:26.080
 powerful about the way it's constructed, which I felt like a bit of an outsider, because I don't

49:26.080 --> 49:32.720
 know the communities. It felt like it's a really strong community around each of these places.

49:34.000 --> 49:39.920
 And so I felt like I was, it made me really wish there was an MIT one. And so there's

49:39.920 --> 49:45.680
 both discussions about the deep community issues within Columbia or Yale or so on,

49:45.680 --> 49:52.240
 and Dartmouth, and there's also the broader community of the Ivy Leagues that people are

49:52.240 --> 49:57.200
 discussing. But I could see that actually expanding more and more and more, but which is,

49:57.200 --> 50:02.640
 it's a powerful coupling, which is the feeling of like this little village, this little community

50:02.640 --> 50:08.480
 we're building together, but also the broader issues. So you could do both discussions.

50:08.480 --> 50:16.560
 One thing that was important to me is talking about social media as a concept. I think the way

50:16.560 --> 50:23.360
 people socialize is very much context dependent. So we're talking about people understanding each

50:23.360 --> 50:31.440
 other through language, through English. And these languages are constructed in a very nuanced way,

50:31.440 --> 50:38.960
 in a very sort of temperamental way, right? And you kind of need a similar context to be able to

50:38.960 --> 50:45.520
 have productive conversations. So to me, it's really important that these groups, they share

50:45.520 --> 50:51.840
 something in common, a really big lived experience, the Ivy League, or their school community. And

50:51.840 --> 50:55.200
 they have a similar vocabulary, they have a similar background, they know what's happening

50:55.200 --> 51:00.480
 in their community. And so having social media that is community connected to me was fundamental.

51:00.480 --> 51:06.240
 Like, you talk about anonymity. To me, community is the thing that when I think about Librex,

51:06.240 --> 51:12.880
 I think what makes it different. It's the fact that everyone knows what's going on. Everyone

51:12.880 --> 51:18.000
 comes from a similar context and people can socialize in a way where they understand each

51:18.000 --> 51:22.080
 other because they've been through, you used the word lived experience, they've been through so

51:22.080 --> 51:23.920
 many of the same lived experiences.

51:23.920 --> 51:32.640
 One clarification, is there an easy way, if you choose, to then connect in meat space,

51:32.640 --> 51:33.680
 in physical space?

51:34.480 --> 51:41.280
 So the, I guess the sort of magic of it, and I was talking to a bunch of Harvard Librexers who I

51:41.280 --> 51:46.320
 met off the app while I was in Boston. And every time they told me this is my favorite part of the

51:46.320 --> 51:50.640
 app, this is what I love about the app. We have this matching system, which is an anonymous direct

51:50.640 --> 51:59.120
 message that you can send to any poster. So, like, I was talking to this guy who, he was really

51:59.120 --> 52:04.480
 into coin collection. And he met other people who are really into coin collection through a post

52:04.480 --> 52:09.200
 and what they he would make a post about coin collection. And then someone would come to him

52:09.200 --> 52:13.760
 and they'd be like, and they could direct message him anonymously. And it would just show them that

52:13.760 --> 52:18.960
 his it would just show him their school. And then they could just text chat, totally anonymously,

52:18.960 --> 52:22.000
 direct message if he accepted the anonymous request.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.760
 Do they see the usernames, right?

52:23.760 --> 52:30.400
 There are no usernames on Librex. It's all just school's names. So he made this post about coin

52:30.400 --> 52:34.000
 collection. And he got a direct message.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.360
 Yeah, I guess so, right?

52:35.360 --> 52:38.240
 No usernames.

52:38.240 --> 52:39.760
 I was just looking at the text.

52:39.760 --> 52:40.560
 Yeah.

52:40.560 --> 52:42.400
 That's interesting. That's right.

52:42.400 --> 52:44.320
 And I can tell you, I can go into why.

52:44.320 --> 52:46.320
 That's really interesting.

52:46.320 --> 52:47.360
 Yeah, I can go into it.

52:47.360 --> 52:49.360
 So it truly is anonymous.

52:49.360 --> 52:52.400
 Well, I mean, it depends on what you mean by anonymous.

52:52.400 --> 52:55.600
 Exactly. It's a very different kind of anonymous.

52:56.160 --> 53:01.760
 And the reason that we made that decision is because we wanted people to connect to ideas.

53:02.320 --> 53:05.520
 We want people to connect to things in the moment. We don't want people to go,

53:06.160 --> 53:10.880
 oh, I know this guy. He said this other thing. And we didn't want people to feel like they were at

53:10.880 --> 53:15.680
 risk of being doxxed. So it's just these are small communities, right? We talked about this. Everyone

53:15.680 --> 53:23.200
 knows someone who knows you. And in 2021, it would not take much to be able to figure out who someone

53:23.200 --> 53:29.440
 might be just through a couple of posts. So it's both safety and about the ideas in terms of not

53:29.440 --> 53:34.480
 adding usernames. Anyway, we have this anonymous direct message system where you can direct

53:34.480 --> 53:41.920
 message the original poster of any post, the OP, if you're a Redditor, of any post. And that makes

53:41.920 --> 53:46.720
 it really easy to meet up because once you guys are one on one, you can exchange a number. You

53:46.720 --> 53:53.440
 can exchange a Snapchat. You can exchange an email. Probably not very often, but you could.

53:53.440 --> 53:56.000
 And then that's how people meet up. Matching.

53:56.560 --> 54:01.920
 And then a lot of people connect in this way. Let me just take a small step into the technical.

54:01.920 --> 54:06.720
 I read somewhere, I don't know if it's true, that one of the reasons you were rejected from YC,

54:06.720 --> 54:14.160
 Y Combinator, in the final rounds is because one of the principles is to refuse to sell user data.

54:15.200 --> 54:21.680
 Can you speak to that? Why do you think it's important not to sell user data?

54:24.560 --> 54:30.400
 Which draws a clear contrast between other, basically any other service on the internet.

54:30.400 --> 54:37.360
 I mean, to be honest, it's quite simple. I mean, we talk about this platform. People are talking

54:37.360 --> 54:44.800
 about their most intimate secrets, their political opinions. How are they feeling about what's going

54:44.800 --> 54:54.080
 on in their city during the summer? How are they feeling about the political cycle and also their

54:54.080 --> 55:00.000
 mental health, their relationships? These are some of the most intimate thoughts that people

55:00.000 --> 55:06.480
 were having. Point blank, I don't think it was ethical to pawn them off for a profit.

55:07.440 --> 55:11.840
 I didn't think it was moral. I don't think I could sleep at night if that was what I was doing,

55:11.840 --> 55:19.360
 is turning these people's most intimate beliefs and secrets into a currency that I bought and sold.

55:20.320 --> 55:22.480
 There's something very off about that.

55:22.480 --> 55:30.000
 Yeah, I tend to believe that there is some room, so like Facebook would just take that data and

55:30.000 --> 55:35.440
 sell it, right? But there's some room in transparency and giving people the choice

55:35.440 --> 55:42.080
 on which parts they can, I wouldn't even see it as sell, but like share with advertisers.

55:42.080 --> 55:43.280
 Are you going to give them a profit?

55:44.080 --> 55:47.920
 So right, you have to monetize, you have to create an entire system, you have to rethink

55:47.920 --> 55:54.960
 this whole thing, right? But as long as you give people control and are transparent and make it

55:54.960 --> 55:59.520
 easy, like I think it's really difficult to delete a Facebook account or like delete all your data.

55:59.520 --> 56:01.520
 I've tried, it's very difficult.

56:03.280 --> 56:07.760
 So like just make it easy and trust in that if you create a great product,

56:07.760 --> 56:11.840
 people are not going to do it. And if they do it, then they're not actually

56:12.560 --> 56:14.800
 a deep loving member of the community. What's that?

56:14.800 --> 56:23.440
 So we very quickly realized that user privacy was something that was not only a core value,

56:23.440 --> 56:28.720
 but was something that users really cared about. And we added this functionality. It's just a

56:28.720 --> 56:35.440
 button that says, forget me. You press it, like two clicks. It's not that hard. We just

56:35.440 --> 56:40.480
 remove your email from the database. You're good.

56:40.480 --> 56:47.920
 Beautiful. I think Facebook should have that. I honestly, so call me crazy, but maybe you can

56:47.920 --> 56:53.200
 actually speak to this, but I don't think Facebook, well now they would, but if they

56:53.200 --> 56:59.680
 did it earlier, they would lose that much money. If they allow like transparently tell people,

56:59.680 --> 57:05.760
 you could just delete everything. They also explained that like in ways that's going to

57:05.760 --> 57:12.400
 potentially like lessen your experience in the short term, like explain that. But then there

57:12.400 --> 57:20.640
 shouldn't be like multiple clicks of a button that don't make any sense. I'm trying to hold

57:20.640 --> 57:25.200
 back from ranting about Instagram because let me just say real quick, because I've been locked

57:25.200 --> 57:31.760
 out of Instagram for a month. And there's a whole group inside Facebook that are like supporters of

57:31.760 --> 57:39.600
 like Lex, help Lex. Free Lex? Free Lex. I wasn't blocked. It was just like a bug in the system.

57:39.600 --> 57:44.960
 Somebody was hammering the API with my account. And so they kept thinking I'm a bot. Anyway,

57:44.960 --> 57:49.280
 it's a bug. It happens to a lot of people, but like, first of all, I appreciate the love from

57:49.280 --> 57:54.720
 all the amazing engineers in Instagram and Facebook. All of those folks, the entire mechanism

57:54.720 --> 58:00.560
 though is somehow broken. I mean, I put that on the leadership, but it's also difficult to operate

58:00.560 --> 58:06.080
 a large company once it scales, all those kinds of things, but it should not be that difficult

58:06.080 --> 58:14.960
 to do some basic, basic things that you want to do, which is in the case of Facebook,

58:15.520 --> 58:22.320
 that's verify your identity to the app. And also in the case of Facebook, in the case of Librex,

58:22.320 --> 58:31.360
 like disappear if you choose. There's downsides to disappearing, but it should not be a difficult

58:31.360 --> 58:40.320
 process. And yeah, I think people are waking up to that. I think there's a lot of room for an app

58:40.320 --> 58:47.520
 like Librex with its foundational ideas to redefine what social media should look like.

58:47.520 --> 58:53.920
 You know, and like you said, I think beautifully, anonymity is not the core value. It's just a tool

58:53.920 --> 59:00.800
 you use. And who knows, maybe anonymity will not always be the tool you use. Like if you give

59:00.800 --> 59:06.080
 people the choice, who knows what this evolves from the login page you initially created.

59:06.080 --> 59:10.640
 The key thing is the founding principles. And again, who knows if you give people a really

59:10.640 --> 59:15.920
 nice way to monetize their data, maybe there'll no longer be a thing that you say, do not sell

59:15.920 --> 59:22.240
 user data. Yeah, all those kinds of things. But the basic principles should be there. And also

59:22.240 --> 59:30.640
 a good, simple interface design goes a really long way. Like simplicity and elegance, which

59:30.640 --> 59:32.560
 Librex currently is. Clubhouse is another app.

59:32.560 --> 59:39.040
 It's gotten a lot better, by the way. I don't mean to go too deep into the history, but the...

59:39.040 --> 59:41.680
 It was bad? I didn't look at the early pictures.

59:41.680 --> 59:43.280
 Oh, thank goodness.

59:43.280 --> 59:47.840
 I read somewhere that it was like a white screen, like with black.

59:47.840 --> 59:57.760
 The up and down buttons were like these big freaking boxes. And I could go on, but it was

59:57.760 --> 1:00:05.760
 my genius design skills. I almost failed art class when I was in first grade. And I think

1:00:05.760 --> 1:00:10.640
 I still have similar skills to my first grade self, but it's gotten a lot better. And thanks

1:00:10.640 --> 1:00:14.240
 to a lot of my friends who have sort of chipped in here and there.

1:00:14.240 --> 1:00:20.720
 Oh, I love the idea of a button that just forget me. I don't know. That's really moving,

1:00:20.720 --> 1:00:28.160
 actually. That's actually all people want, is they want, I think... Okay, I'll speak

1:00:28.160 --> 1:00:34.800
 to my experience. I would give so much more if I could just disappear if I needed to.

1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:42.240
 And I trusted the community. I trusted the founders and the principals. That's really

1:00:42.240 --> 1:00:51.360
 powerful, man. The trust and ease of escape. Yeah. You've also kind of mentioned moderation,

1:00:51.360 --> 1:00:58.000
 which is really interesting. So with this anonymity and this community, I don't know

1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:01.200
 if you've heard of the internet, but there's trolls on the internet.

1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:01.760
 So I've heard.

1:01:01.760 --> 1:01:09.360
 And even if they go to Yale and Dartmouth, there's still people that probably enjoy

1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:19.520
 sort of being the guerrilla warfare, counter revolutionary, and just like creating chaos

1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:27.040
 in a place of love. So how do you prevent chaos and hatred breaking out in Librex?

1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:33.760
 So the way I think about it is we have these principals. They're pretty simple and they're

1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:38.560
 pretty easy to enforce. And then beyond the principals, we have a set of moderators,

1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:42.560
 moderate from every single Ivy League school, a team of diverse moderators who enforce these

1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:47.200
 principals, but not only enforce the principals, but kind of clue us in to what's happening

1:01:47.200 --> 1:01:52.720
 in their community and how the real life context of their community translates to the Librex

1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:59.680
 context of their community. And beyond that, we have conversation with them about the

1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:03.760
 standards of the community. And we're constantly talking about what needs to be further

1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:08.240
 elucidated and what needs to be tweaked. And we're in constant communication with the

1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:13.520
 community. Now, if you want me to get into the principals that underlie Librex's moderation

1:02:13.520 --> 1:02:14.000
 policy.

1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:17.760
 Yeah, please. Maybe you can explain that there's moderators. What does that mean? How

1:02:17.760 --> 1:02:20.880
 are they chosen? And what are the principals under which they operate?

1:02:20.880 --> 1:02:26.560
 Sure. So how are the moderators chosen? The moderators are all volunteers. They're Librexers

1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:33.840
 who reach out to me and respond to the opportunity to become moderator. And the way they're

1:02:33.840 --> 1:02:39.440
 chosen is basically we want to make sure that they're in tune with their community. We want

1:02:39.440 --> 1:02:43.440
 to make sure they come from diverse backgrounds and we want to make sure that they sort of

1:02:43.440 --> 1:02:47.840
 understand what the community is about. And then we ask them some questions about how

1:02:47.840 --> 1:02:52.560
 they would deal with certain scenarios, ones that we've had in the past and we feel strongly

1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:56.000
 about. And then also ones that are a little more murky, where we want to see that they're

1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:03.760
 sort of thinking about these things in a critical way. And from there, we choose a set and they

1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:10.000
 have the power to take down posts. Of course, everything at the end of the day pens my

1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:15.360
 review, but they can take them down and we can reinstate them if it's a problem. But

1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:20.560
 they can take down posts and they can advocate for different moderation standards and different

1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:21.600
 moderation policies.

1:03:22.320 --> 1:03:28.960
 So for now, you're the Linus Torvalds of this community. So meaning like you're able to,

1:03:29.680 --> 1:03:37.040
 like people are actually able to like email you or like text you, contact you and get

1:03:37.040 --> 1:03:42.080
 a response. Like you respond to basically everybody. And then you're like really, you

1:03:42.080 --> 1:03:47.600
 know, you're, you're living that live on people's floor life currently. That's not

1:03:47.600 --> 1:03:54.320
 necessarily, this is the early days folks. I knew Ryan before he was a billionaire and

1:03:54.320 --> 1:04:02.800
 he was cool. And then he was in a mansion making meats on his barbecue. No. Okay. But

1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:12.320
 you know, how does it scale? Like what I suppose, how does it scale is the question. I

1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:17.280
 mean, with Linus, I don't know if you're familiar with the Linux open source community,

1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:21.520
 but he still stayed at the top for a while. It was really important. Like leadership there

1:04:21.520 --> 1:04:26.240
 was really important to drive that large scale, really productive open source community.

1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:32.960
 What do you see your role as Librex grows and in general, what are the mechanisms of

1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:34.480
 scaling here for moderation?

1:04:35.360 --> 1:04:41.520
 Where I see it, open discourse is fundamental to the purpose of the app, right? So as the,

1:04:42.320 --> 1:04:49.760
 I guess you could say founder, CEO, what have you, part of my purpose has to be to enforce

1:04:49.760 --> 1:04:54.080
 the vision, right? And part of the vision is open discourse. And that does come down

1:04:54.080 --> 1:05:00.560
 in part to reasonable moderation and community guided reasonable moderation. So I imagine

1:05:00.560 --> 1:05:05.600
 that will always be something that I'm intimately involved with to some degree. Now the

1:05:05.600 --> 1:05:14.080
 degree to which the way in which that manifests, I imagine will have to change, right? And

1:05:14.080 --> 1:05:19.680
 hopefully I'll be able to, just like you can hire a CTO, hopefully I'll be able to be

1:05:19.680 --> 1:05:27.360
 in integrated in hiring people who understand the way that we are sort of operating and

1:05:27.360 --> 1:05:32.400
 the reasonable standards of moderation. And there can be a sort of hierarchical structure.

1:05:32.960 --> 1:05:38.720
 But I think when you have a product whose key purpose is to allow people to have these

1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:46.720
 difficult conversations on campus that need to be had, I can never fully, I don't think

1:05:46.720 --> 1:05:51.920
 I can fully ever abdicate that responsibility. I think that would be like, I mean, that would

1:05:51.920 --> 1:05:57.280
 be like Bezos abdicating eCommerce, right? That's part of the job.

1:05:57.280 --> 1:06:02.320
 Yeah, of course you can run companies in different ways. I think because he might have

1:06:02.320 --> 1:06:05.200
 abdicated quite a bit of the details there.

1:06:05.200 --> 1:06:06.240
 It's hard for me to say.

1:06:06.240 --> 1:06:10.400
 Because Amazon does so many things. I think probably the better examples like Elon with

1:06:10.400 --> 1:06:15.760
 rockets, he's still at the core of the engineering. He's at the core of the engineering. There's

1:06:15.760 --> 1:06:20.640
 some fundamental questions. He probably does way too much of the engineering. He's the

1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:28.000
 lowest level detail. But you're saying the core things that make the app work is the

1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:30.000
 moderation of difficult conversations.

1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:38.320
 And by the way, I'm 21 years old. Let's remind everyone of that. If this thing does scale

1:06:38.320 --> 1:06:44.720
 and if this thing continues to be a positive force in a lot of people's lives, who knows

1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:50.960
 what will happen in the next, what I'll learn. I'm still growing definitely as a leader,

1:06:50.960 --> 1:06:56.880
 still growing as a thinker, still growing as a person. I can't pretend that I know how

1:06:56.880 --> 1:07:03.520
 to run a business that is worth up to $1 billion, whatever. I can't pretend I know how to run

1:07:03.520 --> 1:07:07.680
 a business that's going to have millions and millions of users. I expect that there are

1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:11.840
 going to be a lot of amazing people who will teach me and that a lot of people who have

1:07:11.840 --> 1:07:17.840
 already kind of stepped into my life and helped me out and taught me things. And I imagine

1:07:17.840 --> 1:07:22.720
 that I'll learn so much more. I just know that moderation is always going to be important

1:07:22.720 --> 1:07:28.320
 to me because I don't think Librex is Librex unless we have open discourse and moderation,

1:07:28.960 --> 1:07:34.800
 reasonable, open, light touch moderation is at the heart of creating that, right?

1:07:35.920 --> 1:07:40.800
 So as a creator of this kind of community in place with anonymity and difficult conversations,

1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:48.160
 what do you think about this touchy three words that people have been tossing around

1:07:48.160 --> 1:07:52.000
 and politicizing, I would say, but is at the core of the founding of this country, which

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:58.800
 is the freedom of speech? How do you think about the freedom of speech, this particular

1:07:58.800 --> 1:08:04.720
 kind of freedom of expression? And do you think it's a fundamental human right? How

1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:10.560
 do you define it to yourself when you're thinking about it? I went down, especially

1:08:10.560 --> 1:08:17.360
 preparing for this conversation down a rabbit hole of like just how unclear it is philosophically

1:08:17.360 --> 1:08:25.200
 what is meant by this kind of freedom. It's not as easy as people think, but it's interesting

1:08:25.200 --> 1:08:30.000
 pragmatically speaking to hear how you think about it in the context of Librex.

1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:37.040
 Yeah, it's a tough one, right? There's a lot there. So I come from the background of being

1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:44.000
 a math major. Maybe it's important to start with that. And I found myself in the middle

1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:49.520
 of this question of freedom of speech. One of the wonderful things is that the Librex

1:08:49.520 --> 1:08:56.160
 community is filled with PhDs and governance majors who have taught me a ton about this

1:08:56.160 --> 1:09:00.560
 sort of thing. And I'm still learning. I'm still growing. I'm still probably going to

1:09:00.560 --> 1:09:08.960
 modify my perspective to some degree. Hopefully. Don't worry. I imagine I'll always support

1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:16.480
 free discourse. Like learning how to speak about stuff is critical here because it's like

1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:23.040
 I'm learning that this is like a minefield of conversations because the moment you say like

1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:29.680
 even saying freedom of speech is a complicated concept, people will be like, oh, we spotted

1:09:29.680 --> 1:09:34.880
 a communist. Like they'll say, there's nothing complicated about freedom. Freedom is freedom,

1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:41.680
 bro. It is complicated. First of all, if you talk about there's different definitions of freedom of

1:09:41.680 --> 1:09:45.920
 speech. If you want to go constitutionally, if you want to talk about the United States

1:09:45.920 --> 1:09:52.560
 specifically and what's legal, it's actually not as exciting and not as beautiful as what

1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:59.760
 people think of. It's complicated. I think there's ideals behind it that we want to see.

1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:06.400
 What does that actually materialize itself in the digital world where we're trying to communicate

1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:14.800
 in ways that allows for difficult conversations and also at the same time doesn't result in the

1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:23.760
 silencing of voices, not through like censorship, but through like just assholes being rude.

1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:24.560
 Spam.

1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:27.200
 Spam. So it could be just bots.

1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:27.840
 Racism.

1:10:28.400 --> 1:10:29.040
 Racism.

1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:39.360
 Going back to the name of the app, Librex. Libre, free. X was put onto for free exchange

1:10:39.360 --> 1:10:45.680
 and the free exchange of what my purpose was to create as much inner communication of ideas,

1:10:46.400 --> 1:10:53.200
 be them repugnant or otherwise as possible. And of course, to do that within legal bounds

1:10:53.200 --> 1:10:58.240
 and to do that without causing anyone to be harassed or doxxed. So to keep things

1:10:58.240 --> 1:11:08.160
 focused on the ideas, not the people. And then no BS crap stuff. And so to me,

1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:13.840
 the easiest way to moderate around that, because as you said, figuring out what is hateful and what

1:11:13.840 --> 1:11:19.040
 is hate speech is really hard, was to say no sweeping statements against core identity groups.

1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:24.880
 And that seems to work on the whole pretty well to be pretty light touch.

1:11:25.680 --> 1:11:27.120
 And it's hard to do though.

1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:27.920
 It's difficult.

1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:30.080
 We like to generalize, we humans.

1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:33.680
 It's difficult, but what it comes down to is be specific.

1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:37.040
 And when you think about what are sweeping statements against core identity groups,

1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:42.320
 oftentimes these are sort of hackneyed subjects. These are things that have been broached and

1:11:43.600 --> 1:11:48.480
 we've heard them before. They don't really lead anywhere productive. So it goes under

1:11:48.480 --> 1:11:51.360
 this principle of be specific in the ideas you're discussing.

1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:57.360
 So even for like positive and humorous stuff, you try to avoid generalizations.

1:11:57.360 --> 1:11:58.720
 Against core identity groups.

1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:01.360
 Core identity groups. Sorry, what are core identity groups?

1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:02.640
 We're talking, kind of like,

1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:06.080
 You know, race, religion.

1:12:06.080 --> 1:12:11.520
 Okay. Got it. Even positive stuff?

1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:13.280
 Well, against, negative.

1:12:13.280 --> 1:12:16.320
 Oh, against. Sorry, against, against. Okay.

1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:23.280
 Very, very, we've learned to be very specific. Very few words, but the community gets it, you know?

1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:31.120
 Yeah, they get it. I mean, this is the thing. The trouble with rules is as the community grows,

1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:33.920
 they'll figure out ways to manipulate the rules.

1:12:33.920 --> 1:12:36.240
 Absolutely. It's human nature. It's creativity.

1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:36.480
 Yeah.

1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:38.880
 Something beautiful about it, of course.

1:12:40.320 --> 1:12:41.840
 From an evolutionary perspective, yes.

1:12:41.840 --> 1:12:45.360
 Yeah, the fact that people are so creative and so looking to,

1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:50.640
 because people are genuinely interested in figuring out these things about social media.

1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:56.640
 And so they'll 100% see like, where's the edge? And I mean, part of that's maintaining some level

1:12:56.640 --> 1:13:02.400
 of vagueness in your rule set, which has its own set of questions and something we could think about.

1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:06.160
 And I'm not implying I have all the answers, but there is something really interesting about people

1:13:06.160 --> 1:13:11.600
 being so engaged that they're looking to figure out where are those edges and what does that mean?

1:13:11.600 --> 1:13:13.040
 What does that edge mean, you know?

1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:17.680
 Well, so one of the things I'm kind of thinking about,

1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:22.000
 like from an individual user of Librex or an individual user of the internet,

1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:27.600
 I think about like that one person that is on Reddit saying hateful stuff or positive stuff,

1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:33.600
 doesn't matter, or funny stuff. One of the things I think about is the trajectory of that individual

1:13:33.600 --> 1:13:40.560
 through life and how social media can help that person become the best version of themselves.

1:13:41.440 --> 1:13:46.560
 I don't mean from like an Orwellian sense, like educate them properly or something.

1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:52.720
 I just mean like, we're all, I believe, we're all fundamentally good. And I also believe

1:13:53.760 --> 1:14:00.240
 we all have the capacity to do, to create some amazing stuff in this world,

1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:06.720
 whether that's ideas or art or engineering, all those kinds of things, just to be amazing people.

1:14:07.440 --> 1:14:13.520
 And I kind of think about like, you know, a lot of social media mechanisms bring out the worst

1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:22.720
 in us. And I try to think like, in the long term, how can the social media or how can a website,

1:14:22.720 --> 1:14:28.640
 how can a tool that you create can make the best, like you take a trajectory that makes you better,

1:14:28.640 --> 1:14:32.960
 better and better and like the best version of yourself. So I think about that because like,

1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:39.360
 you know, Twitter can really take you down some dark trajectories. I've seen people just not being

1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:43.440
 the best version of themselves. Forget the cancel culture and all that kind of stuff. It's just like

1:14:43.440 --> 1:14:49.040
 they're not developing intellectually in the way that's going to make the best version of themselves.

1:14:49.040 --> 1:14:55.760
 I think Reddit, I'm not sure what I think about Reddit yet, because one positive side is all the

1:14:55.760 --> 1:15:01.840
 shit posting I read. It could be just like a release valve for some stress in life. And you

1:15:01.840 --> 1:15:07.200
 almost have like a parallel life where you're in meat space. You might be actually becoming

1:15:07.200 --> 1:15:11.440
 successful and so on and growing and so on, but you just need some times to be angry at somebody.

1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:19.120
 But I tend to not think that's possible. I think if you're shit posting, you're probably not

1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:25.600
 spending your time the best way you could. I don't know. I'm torn on that. But do you think

1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:31.920
 about that with Librex of creating a trajectory for the Yale, for the Dartmouth, for the students,

1:15:31.920 --> 1:15:33.920
 to where they grow intellectually?

1:15:33.920 --> 1:15:41.760
 One thing that I think about a lot is how do you incentivize positive content creation? How do you

1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:50.640
 incentivize really intellectual content creation? It's something that, frankly, I think about every

1:15:50.640 --> 1:15:58.240
 single day. And I think there are ways that... I mean, one thing that's great about humans is that

1:15:58.240 --> 1:16:03.120
 they can be incentivized, right? And I think there are ways that you can incentivize people to make

1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:05.840
 the right kind of content if that's your goal.

1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:10.160
 So you think such mechanisms exist for such incentivization?

1:16:10.160 --> 1:16:13.680
 I do. I don't want to let the cat out of the bag, so to speak.

1:16:13.680 --> 1:16:16.560
 Do you have already concrete ideas in your mind?

1:16:16.560 --> 1:16:20.480
 I have about three concrete ideas that I'm very, very optimistic about.

1:16:22.160 --> 1:16:26.960
 You don't even need to share them. I understand totally. But the fact that you have them,

1:16:26.960 --> 1:16:33.920
 that's really good. Because I feel like sometimes the downfall of the social media is that there's

1:16:33.920 --> 1:16:42.720
 literally not even a thinking or a discussion about the incentivization of positive long term

1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:48.320
 content creation. Twitter, I really was excited about this when they said like,

1:16:48.880 --> 1:16:52.400
 when Jack has talked about creating healthy conversations.

1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:57.920
 He does seem to care. I've listened to him. I mean, he has a very particular way of saying

1:16:57.920 --> 1:17:01.920
 things. But you get the impression that he's someone who actually cares about these things

1:17:01.920 --> 1:17:03.520
 within the limits of his power.

1:17:03.520 --> 1:17:10.160
 Yeah. And that's the question, the limits of the power. Librex is growing not just in the number

1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:18.480
 of communities, but also in the way you're incentivizing positive conversations, like coupled

1:17:18.480 --> 1:17:22.560
 with a moderation and so on. So you think there's a lot of innovation to be had in that area?

1:17:22.560 --> 1:17:27.280
 There's a tremendous amount. I think when you think about the reasons people post,

1:17:27.920 --> 1:17:34.480
 fundamentally, people want to make a positive impact on their community to some degree. Now,

1:17:34.480 --> 1:17:39.440
 there will always be bad actors. And part of the benefit of our moderation structure is that we

1:17:39.440 --> 1:17:45.840
 can limit some of those bad actors, no bot accounts, no brigading. At the same time,

1:17:45.840 --> 1:17:50.720
 the more you incentivize a certain type of behavior, the better it's going to be. And we

1:17:50.720 --> 1:17:58.240
 don't see it as our role as the platform to force the community in a direction. And frankly, I don't

1:17:58.240 --> 1:18:03.520
 think it would be good for anyone, the community or the conversations, if we forced a specific type

1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:10.320
 of conversation. We just need to make the tools to allow people to be good and to incentivize good

1:18:10.320 --> 1:18:10.880
 behavior.

1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:19.600
 Yeah, I believe that. You will not need to censor if you allow people at scale to be good. The good

1:18:19.600 --> 1:18:21.440
 will overpower the assholes.

1:18:21.440 --> 1:18:25.120
 That's my fundamental belief. I'm very optimistic about that.

1:18:26.080 --> 1:18:32.400
 But currently, Librex is small in the sense that it's a small set of communities that I believe.

1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:38.400
 And you mentioned to me offline that by design, you're scaling slowly and carefully.

1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:38.960
 That's right.

1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:48.480
 So how does Librex scale? Is it possible? Facebook also started with a small set of communities

1:18:48.480 --> 1:18:55.280
 that were schools, and then now grew to be basically the, if not one of the largest social

1:18:55.280 --> 1:19:03.120
 networks in the world. Do you see Librex as potentially scaling to be beyond even college

1:19:03.120 --> 1:19:06.560
 campuses, but encompassing the whole world?

1:19:06.560 --> 1:19:17.440
 It's a long timeline. I'll say this. This gets back to where did Facebook go wrong?

1:19:17.440 --> 1:19:24.400
 Because clearly, they did a lot right. And we can only speculate about what the objectives

1:19:24.400 --> 1:19:30.160
 were of the founders of Facebook. I'm sure they've said some things, but it's always

1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:36.880
 interesting to know what the mythology is versus what the truth is of the matter. So

1:19:36.880 --> 1:19:42.240
 perhaps they've been very successful. I mean, they've taken over the world to some extent.

1:19:43.920 --> 1:19:49.440
 At the same time, the goals of Librex are to create these positive communities and

1:19:49.440 --> 1:19:54.000
 these open conversations where people can have real conversation and connection in

1:19:54.000 --> 1:20:00.720
 their communities in a vulnerable and authentic way. And so to that end, which I imagine might

1:20:00.720 --> 1:20:06.320
 be different than the goals of a Facebook, for example, one thing that we want to do

1:20:06.320 --> 1:20:13.760
 is keep things intimate and community based. So each school is its own community. And perhaps

1:20:13.760 --> 1:20:19.040
 you could have a slightly broader community. Maybe you could have a, I know the California

1:20:19.040 --> 1:20:24.880
 system is an obvious one. Packed time might be an obvious one. And we can think about that. But

1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:33.200
 fundamentally, the unit of community is your school or your school community. So that's one

1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:38.560
 difference that I think will help us. The other thing is that we're scaling intentionally, meaning

1:20:38.560 --> 1:20:44.320
 that when we expand to a school, we have moderators in place. We have moderators who understand that

1:20:44.320 --> 1:20:50.720
 school's environment in a very personal level. And we're growing responsibly. We're growing as we're

1:20:50.720 --> 1:20:58.960
 ready, both technologically, but also socially. But as we think we have the tools to preserve

1:20:58.960 --> 1:21:02.640
 the community and to encourage the community to create the sort of content that we want them to

1:21:02.640 --> 1:21:09.120
 create. And there's a lot of ways to define community. So first of all, there's geographic

1:21:09.120 --> 1:21:16.240
 community as well. But the way you're kind of defining community with Yale and Dartmouth is the

1:21:16.240 --> 1:21:24.640
 email, right? That's what gives you, there's a power to the email in the sense that that's how

1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:32.560
 you can verify, efficiently verify yourself with being a single individual in the university. In

1:21:32.560 --> 1:21:39.360
 that same way, you can verify your employment at a company, for example, like Google, Microsoft,

1:21:39.360 --> 1:21:45.360
 Facebook. Do you see potentially taking on those communities? That'd be fascinating,

1:21:45.920 --> 1:21:50.160
 getting like anonymous community conversations inside Google.

1:21:50.960 --> 1:21:57.280
 100% crossed my mind. To some extent, this is something where I understand the college

1:21:57.280 --> 1:22:04.400
 experience. I understand the need. And I've never worked at Google. I don't know if they would hire

1:22:04.400 --> 1:22:14.080
 me. Hopefully, maybe as a product manager. I think if there's a community that needs this product,

1:22:14.080 --> 1:22:22.800
 and has that will, which I think, especially as Librex continues to grow and expand and change

1:22:22.800 --> 1:22:27.840
 and learn. Because that's what we're doing is we're learning, right? With each community, it's not just

1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:35.440
 about growing. It's about learning from each of these communities and iterating. I think it's

1:22:35.440 --> 1:22:40.160
 quite likely there are going to be all sorts of communities that could use this tool to improve

1:22:40.160 --> 1:22:48.400
 their culture, so to speak. So forgive me, I'm not actually that knowledgeable about the history of

1:22:48.400 --> 1:22:55.280
 attempts of building social networks to solve the problem that you're solving. But I was made aware

1:22:55.280 --> 1:23:05.760
 that there was an app or at least a social network called Yik Yak that had a similar kind of

1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:14.720
 focus. I think the thing you've spoken about that differs between Librex and Yik Yak is that Yik Yak

1:23:14.720 --> 1:23:21.520
 was defined, am I pronouncing it right even? You good? I'm good. I met the founder so I can confirm.

1:23:21.520 --> 1:23:29.840
 Okay, you can confirm, cool. That it was constrained to a geographical area versus like to the actual

1:23:29.840 --> 1:23:38.720
 community and that somehow had fundamental like actual differences in social dynamics that resulted.

1:23:38.720 --> 1:23:45.040
 But can you speak to the history of Yik Yak? Like how does Librex differ? What lessons have you learned

1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:50.160
 from that? Oh, and I should say that I guess there was controversial, I don't know, I didn't look at

1:23:50.160 --> 1:23:53.840
 the details, but I'm guessing there's a bunch of racism and hate speech and all that kind of stuff

1:23:53.840 --> 1:24:01.840
 that emerged on Yik Yak. Okay, so that's an example of like, okay, here's how it goes wrong when you

1:24:01.840 --> 1:24:09.760
 have anonymity on college campuses. So how does Librex going to do better? Yeah, Yik Yak had a

1:24:09.760 --> 1:24:14.720
 lot of problems, content problems, but the content problems go deeper than maybe what the press would

1:24:14.720 --> 1:24:21.680
 reveal. There's a lot to say and part of it is parsing exactly what to talk about when it comes

1:24:21.680 --> 1:24:27.440
 to Yik Yak and when you talk about startups, I mean you know this, you know startups, and you

1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:32.880
 look at the postmortem, it's almost never what people think it is. And oftentimes these things

1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:39.040
 are somewhat unknowable and the degree to which people seeking confirmation bias to somebody,

1:24:39.040 --> 1:24:44.720
 seeking closure, look to find a singular attribute that caused the failure. It feels like the little

1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:51.600
 details often make all the difference. Yes, and I think the details are so little that as humans

1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:58.560
 we are not capable of parsing even what they are. But I'll tell you my perspective on it,

1:24:58.560 --> 1:25:04.880
 knowing that I am also a human with biases. In this particular case, very significant biases.

1:25:08.720 --> 1:25:14.960
 So I started building Librex for its own merits. At first I wasn't aware of Yik Yak, but as I started

1:25:14.960 --> 1:25:20.080
 to talk to people about this platform I was building, I was made aware of Yik Yak and I

1:25:20.080 --> 1:25:28.000
 built it from day one with a lot of the issues Yik Yak had in mind. So as you said, the one

1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:33.680
 difference between Yik Yak is the geographical versus community based aspect. Going along with

1:25:33.680 --> 1:25:39.040
 that, one thing I realized by researching social media sites is that the majority of

1:25:39.920 --> 1:25:48.240
 the negative content, the content that's terrible and breaking all the rules is created by really,

1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:54.800
 and the people who are not reformable, so to speak, the people who are not showing the best

1:25:54.800 --> 1:26:02.960
 part of the human experience. It's a really small minority, right? I remember, I was listening to

1:26:02.960 --> 1:26:08.880
 the founder of 4ChamMoot talk about this, how like one guy was able to basically destroy

1:26:10.080 --> 1:26:16.160
 like large swaths of his community. Yeah, that's part of what makes it exciting for that

1:26:16.160 --> 1:26:22.080
 minority is how much power they can have. So if you're predisposed to think in this way,

1:26:22.080 --> 1:26:27.120
 it's exciting that you can walk into, like I mentioned the party before, you have a party

1:26:27.120 --> 1:26:35.120
 of a lot of positive people and it feels, especially if you don't have much power in this

1:26:35.120 --> 1:26:44.800
 world, it feels exceptionally empowering to just, to destroy like the lives of many.

1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:51.680
 Yeah. And if you think this way, it's a problem. But I'm hopeful that you're right, that in most

1:26:51.680 --> 1:26:56.480
 cases it's going to be a minority of people. I think it is. And that's what the research has

1:26:56.480 --> 1:27:04.320
 showed. And one really powerful thing is that we can really actively control who comes in and out

1:27:04.320 --> 1:27:10.080
 of our community based on the.edu verification. And we can also control who's not in our community

1:27:10.080 --> 1:27:16.400
 because we have that lever where each account is associated with a.edu. So that's the first point

1:27:16.400 --> 1:27:22.560
 I would point out there. Second point is controlled expansion, meaning that we have community

1:27:22.560 --> 1:27:29.040
 moderation. We have this panel that allows the moderators to see all of the highly downloaded

1:27:29.040 --> 1:27:34.240
 content, all of the reported content, all the flagged content and look through it and decide

1:27:34.240 --> 1:27:40.720
 what they like and what's appropriate and what's not appropriate. And we have, we ping every

1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:45.920
 moderator when there's a report. So things are taken down pretty quickly. And we have our

1:27:45.920 --> 1:27:51.600
 standards and we have, I think above all of that, we have a mission and it's a community based

1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:57.040
 mission. Yik Yak was more of a fun app and by its own admission, it was a place where people could

1:27:57.040 --> 1:28:05.920
 enjoy themselves and could sort of yak. Yik Yak, chit chat. We have a bigger purpose than that,

1:28:05.920 --> 1:28:11.920
 frankly. And I think that shows in the people who self select to be on that app, to be on Librex

1:28:11.920 --> 1:28:18.320
 and to be on Yik Yak, respectively. The last thing I'll say is Yik Yak was very few characters. It

1:28:18.320 --> 1:28:22.880
 was a Twitter esque platform. And that doesn't allow for a tremendous amount of nuance. It

1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:27.680
 doesn't allow for a tremendous amount of conversation. Librex is much more long form.

1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:36.160
 And so the kind of posts that you'll get on Librex can span pages. What people are starting

1:28:36.160 --> 1:28:41.520
 to realize is that they can reach a lot more people at a lot more pertinent of a time a lot

1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:47.440
 more quickly by posting their thoughts on Librex than if they went to their school newspaper.

1:28:47.440 --> 1:28:52.800
 And I think the school newspapers might be a little worried about that. But more importantly,

1:28:52.800 --> 1:28:57.520
 we're connecting people in this way where long form communication with nuance that takes into

1:28:57.520 --> 1:29:03.840
 account everything that's happening in the community temporally is really available at

1:29:03.840 --> 1:29:11.920
 Librex and not really communicable in 240 or 480 or whatever the number of characters the yaks were

1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:19.280
 bound to. And I could talk about the history of Yik Yak if you want me to go further. They started,

1:29:19.280 --> 1:29:25.440
 I think they were at 12 schools. And then spring break hit. People told their friends,

1:29:25.440 --> 1:29:30.560
 look at this app. A thousand schools signed up and had active communities. They had a problem

1:29:30.560 --> 1:29:36.000
 on their hands. And then the high schools come on board. I think a lot of the things you said

1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:42.880
 ring true to me, but especially the vision one, which I do think having a vision in the leadership,

1:29:42.880 --> 1:29:48.320
 having a mission makes all the difference in the world. That's both for the engineers that

1:29:48.320 --> 1:29:54.080
 are building, like the team that's building the app, the moderation and users because they kind of,

1:29:54.880 --> 1:30:02.480
 the mission carries itself through the behavior of the people on the social network.

1:30:02.480 --> 1:30:08.080
 As a small tangent, let me ask you something about Parler, but it's less about Parler,

1:30:08.080 --> 1:30:14.720
 more about AWS. So AWS removed Parler from his platform, you know, for whatever reasons,

1:30:14.720 --> 1:30:21.600
 it doesn't really matter. But the fact that AWS would do this was really, really bothered me

1:30:21.600 --> 1:30:29.440
 personally, because I saw AWS as the computing infrastructure and I always thought that part

1:30:29.440 --> 1:30:34.080
 could not put a finger on its scale. And I don't know what your thoughts are. Like,

1:30:34.080 --> 1:30:40.640
 were you bothered by Parler being removed from AWS? And how does that affect how you think about

1:30:40.640 --> 1:30:44.800
 the computing infrastructure on which Librex is based?

1:30:45.680 --> 1:30:52.160
 I was bothered not so much by Parler specifically being taken out of AWS, but more the fact that

1:30:52.160 --> 1:30:59.040
 something that's like a highway, something that people rely on, that people build on top of, that

1:30:59.040 --> 1:31:06.000
 people assume is going to be somewhat position agnostic, like a road that people drive on, is

1:31:06.720 --> 1:31:13.520
 becoming ideologically sort of discriminatory. And of course, mind you, Amazon can do what it

1:31:13.520 --> 1:31:18.720
 wants. It's a private company and I support the rights of private companies. I just, on an ethical

1:31:18.720 --> 1:31:27.520
 and sort of a deep moral level, I wonder, like, at what point should a company sort of be agnostic

1:31:27.520 --> 1:31:34.880
 in that regard and let developers build on top of their infrastructure? And where does that

1:31:34.880 --> 1:31:36.400
 responsibility hold?

1:31:36.400 --> 1:31:43.920
 Yes, it makes you hope that there's going to be, from a capitalistic sense, competitors to AWS

1:31:43.920 --> 1:31:49.040
 would say, like, we're not going to put our finger on the scale. I mean, on the highway is a good

1:31:49.040 --> 1:31:56.400
 sort of example. It's like if a privately owned highway said, you know, we're no longer going to

1:31:56.400 --> 1:32:03.600
 allow, we're only going to allow electric vehicles. And a bunch of people in this world would be like,

1:32:03.600 --> 1:32:12.480
 yes, because electric is good for the environment. And, you know, I think that's a good example.

1:32:12.480 --> 1:32:20.560
 You know, yes, but then you have to consider the, like, the slippery slope nature of it, but also

1:32:20.560 --> 1:32:25.920
 like the negative impact on the lives of many others and what that means for innovation and for,

1:32:25.920 --> 1:32:32.640
 like, competition, again, in a capitalistic sense. So, there's some nature, there's some level to

1:32:32.640 --> 1:32:40.320
 this hierarchy of our existence that we should not allow to manipulate what's built on top of it. It

1:32:40.320 --> 1:32:48.640
 should be truly infrastructure. And it feels like compute is storage and compute is that layer. Like,

1:32:48.640 --> 1:32:53.840
 it shouldn't be messed with. I haven't seen anybody really complain about it, like, in terms

1:32:53.840 --> 1:32:59.040
 of government. And I'm not even sure government is the right mechanism through policy and regulation

1:32:59.040 --> 1:33:06.160
 to step in. Because again, they do a messy job of fixing things. But I do hope there's competitors

1:33:06.160 --> 1:33:12.560
 to AWS to make AWS then step up. Because I do think, you know, I'm a fan of AWS, except this.

1:33:12.560 --> 1:33:13.360
 Good service.

1:33:13.360 --> 1:33:15.760
 It's a good service until this.

1:33:15.760 --> 1:33:18.880
 Until, yeah, until they rip out the rug.

1:33:20.320 --> 1:33:26.080
 And the point is, it's not that necessarily their decision was a bad one with Parler,

1:33:26.080 --> 1:33:32.640
 in particular. It's that, like, the slippery slope nature of it, but also

1:33:32.640 --> 1:33:38.400
 the, it takes the good actors that are creating amazing products and makes them more fearful.

1:33:38.400 --> 1:33:43.200
 And when you're more fearful, it's the same reason that anonymity is a tool that you don't create

1:33:43.200 --> 1:33:47.040
 the best thing you could possibly create. When you're fearful, you don't create.

1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:48.560
 That's right.

1:33:48.560 --> 1:33:54.000
 I think we've kind of talked about it a little bit. But I wonder if we can kind of revisit it

1:33:54.000 --> 1:34:00.400
 a little bit. I talked to a guy named Ronald Sullivan, who's a faculty at Harvard, a law

1:34:00.400 --> 1:34:07.680
 professor. He was on the legal defense team. He was the lawyer for Harvey Weinstein and Aaron

1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:13.440
 Hernandez for the double murder case. So he takes on these really difficult cases of unpopular

1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:20.400
 figures because he believes like that's the way you test that we believe in the rule of law.

1:34:20.400 --> 1:34:30.160
 But he was, there's a big protest in Harvard to get him, basically censor him and to get him to

1:34:30.160 --> 1:34:36.800
 no longer be faculty dean, all those kinds of things. And it was by a minority of students, but

1:34:38.160 --> 1:34:44.000
 there's a huge blowback, obviously in the public, but also inside Harvard, like that's not okay.

1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:48.640
 He stands for the very principles at the founding of Harvard and at the principles of the founding

1:34:48.640 --> 1:34:56.320
 of this country and the law and so on. But the basic argument is that it was about safe spaces,

1:34:57.360 --> 1:35:03.760
 that it's unsafe to have somebody who is basically supporting Harvey Weinstein, right?

1:35:05.760 --> 1:35:12.800
 What do you think about this whole idea of safe spaces on college campuses? Because it feels like

1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:18.000
 the mission of Librex is pushing back against the idea of safe spaces.

1:35:19.040 --> 1:35:23.360
 I think safe spaces are fine when they're within people's private lives, within their homes,

1:35:23.920 --> 1:35:28.880
 within their religious organizations. I think the problem becomes when the institution starts

1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:40.560
 encouraging or backing safe spaces because what are people being safe from? And oftentimes,

1:35:40.560 --> 1:35:47.680
 it seems like there's this idea that the harm that's being attempted to be mitigated is the

1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:51.360
 harm of confronting opinions you disagree with, opinions you might find repugnant.

1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:58.960
 And if this is conflated with a need for safety, then that's where the idea of liberal arts

1:35:58.960 --> 1:36:05.440
 education sort of dies. Of course, it's complicated and we still want to have safe

1:36:05.440 --> 1:36:11.280
 intellectual environments. But the way that I hear the term safe space used today,

1:36:11.840 --> 1:36:17.280
 I think it doesn't really have a place within the intellectual context.

1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:23.040
 Yeah, it's funny. I mean, this is why Librex is really exciting, is it's pushing those

1:36:23.040 --> 1:36:29.680
 difficult conversations. And I'd love to see, ultimately, there does seem to be an asymmetry

1:36:29.680 --> 1:36:39.120
 of power that results in the concept of safe spaces and hate speech being redefined in the

1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:44.000
 slippery slope kind of way where it means basically anything you want it to mean. And

1:36:44.880 --> 1:36:52.160
 it basically is used to silence people, to silence people. They're like good, thoughtful experts.

1:36:52.160 --> 1:37:00.640
 Also, beyond that, I would say it has not just a pragmatic purpose, which is the silencing,

1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:05.360
 but also sort of an ideological purpose, which is, and a linguistic purpose, which is to

1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:14.400
 conflate words with unsafety and harm and violence, which is what you kind of see on a

1:37:14.400 --> 1:37:20.320
 cultural linguistic level is happening all around us right now is that this idea that words are harm

1:37:20.320 --> 1:37:25.200
 is a very dangerous and slippery concept. I mean, you don't have to slip that far to see

1:37:25.200 --> 1:37:30.480
 why that's a problem. Once we start making words into violence and we start criminalizing words,

1:37:30.480 --> 1:37:37.680
 we get into some really authoritarian territory, things that I think, I mean, myself and my

1:37:37.680 --> 1:37:42.080
 background, I don't know how much we have to go into it, but things that my ancestors

1:37:42.080 --> 1:37:46.640
 certainly would be worried about. What's your background?

1:37:46.640 --> 1:37:52.160
 I'm a child of Holocaust survivors and pro grom survivors, so.

1:37:52.160 --> 1:37:56.560
 Yeah, I mean, me as well from different directions. I come from the Soviet Union, so

1:37:56.560 --> 1:38:03.120
 there's, well, like in most of us, hate and love runs through our blood from our history.

1:38:04.080 --> 1:38:07.840
 You mentioned MIT is being added to Librex. Has it already been added?

1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:09.840
 Yes, it was added today.

1:38:09.840 --> 1:38:16.400
 Today, okay. So let me ask you, this is exciting because I don't know what your thoughts are about

1:38:16.400 --> 1:38:21.840
 this, but I'll tell you from my perspective, if you're, and a lot of MIT folks listen to this,

1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:28.000
 I would love it if you joined Librex. It'd be interesting to explore conversations

1:38:29.040 --> 1:38:38.000
 on several topics inside MIT, but one of the most moving that hasn't been discussed at all

1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:46.240
 at all, except in little flourishes here and there, is the topic of Jeffrey Epstein.

1:38:47.840 --> 1:38:57.360
 Now, there's been a huge amount of, like, impact that the connections of various faculty to Jeffrey

1:38:57.360 --> 1:39:04.880
 Epstein and the various things that have been said had on MIT, but it feels like the difficult

1:39:04.880 --> 1:39:11.680
 conversation haven't had been had. It's the administration trying to clean up and give a bunch

1:39:11.680 --> 1:39:18.080
 of BS to try to pretend, like, let's just hide this part. Like nothing is broken, nothing to see

1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:25.760
 here. Here's a bad dude that did some bad things and some faculty that kind of misbehaved a little

1:39:25.760 --> 1:39:31.040
 bit because they're a little bit clueless. Let's all look the other way. Harvard did this much

1:39:31.040 --> 1:39:37.520
 better, by the way. They completely, it's almost like people pretend like Harvard didn't have

1:39:37.520 --> 1:39:45.280
 anything to do with Jeffrey Epstein. But I think I'd be curious to hear what those conversations

1:39:45.280 --> 1:39:55.040
 are because there's conversations on the topic of like, well, obviously sort of sexual assault and

1:39:55.040 --> 1:40:00.160
 disrespecting women on any kind of level within academia, but just women in general.

1:40:00.160 --> 1:40:05.840
 That's an important topic to talk about, various, many sets of difficult conversations. And the

1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:15.360
 other topic is, you know, funding for research. Like how are, like, what are we okay taking money

1:40:15.360 --> 1:40:20.160
 from and what are we not okay taking money from? You know, there's a lot of just interesting

1:40:20.160 --> 1:40:27.280
 difficult conversations to be had. I've worked with people who, you know, refuse to take money

1:40:27.280 --> 1:40:32.800
 from DOD, Department of Defense, for example, because in some indirect or direct way, you're

1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:37.520
 funding military industrial complex, all those kinds of things. I think with Jeffrey Epstein,

1:40:37.520 --> 1:40:44.400
 it's even more stark, this contrast of like, well, what is and isn't ethical to take money from?

1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:51.280
 And I just think, forget academia, I think there's just a lot of interesting, deep human

1:40:51.280 --> 1:40:55.760
 discussions to be had. And they haven't been. And there's been somebody, I don't know if you're

1:40:55.760 --> 1:41:02.160
 familiar with Eric Weinstein, who has been outraged by the fact that nobody's talking about Jeffrey

1:41:02.160 --> 1:41:08.960
 Epstein. Nobody's having these difficult conversations. And Eric himself has had a sort of

1:41:10.080 --> 1:41:16.960
 complicated journey through academia, in the sense that he's a really kind of renegade thinker in

1:41:16.960 --> 1:41:21.280
 many kinds of ways. I'm not sure if you know who Eric is, by any chance. Heard the name. Okay. I

1:41:21.280 --> 1:41:27.040
 actually checked out ZEV. ZEV. It was heartening for me to see that I was not the youngest person

1:41:28.560 --> 1:41:31.360
 on this podcast. You're the second youngest. Second youngest.

1:41:34.080 --> 1:41:45.440
 That's hilarious. But Eric, he's kind of a renegade thinker. He's a mathematical physicist

1:41:45.440 --> 1:41:52.560
 with, I believe, a PhD at Harvard, and he spent some time at MIT and so on. But he speaks to the

1:41:52.560 --> 1:41:58.240
 fact that there's a culture of conformity and so on. And if you're somebody who's a bit outside of

1:41:58.240 --> 1:42:02.800
 the box, a bit weird, in whatever dimension of weird, that makes you actually kind of interesting

1:42:03.440 --> 1:42:09.360
 that the system kind of wants to make you an outcast, wants to throw you out. And so he kind

1:42:09.360 --> 1:42:14.400
 of opposes that whole idea. He's the perfect person to have conversations with in this kind

1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:22.800
 of Librex kind of context of anonymity. Because I'll tell you the few conversations that came across

1:42:22.800 --> 1:42:30.160
 and they were very quickly silenced. And I'm troubled by it. I'm not sure what to think of it.

1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:39.200
 Is there's a few threads inside MIT, like on a mailing list, discussing Marvin Minsky. I don't

1:42:39.200 --> 1:42:44.560
 know if you know who that is. He's an AI researcher. He's a seminal figure in AI before your time, but

1:42:44.560 --> 1:42:50.720
 one of the most important people in the history of artificial intelligence. And there was a

1:42:50.720 --> 1:43:00.880
 discussion on a thread that involved the interaction between Marvin Minsky and Jeffrey Epstein.

1:43:01.600 --> 1:43:07.360
 That conversation was quickly shut down. One person was pushed out of MIT, Richard Stallman,

1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:13.120
 who's one of the key figures in the, because of that, because he wanted some clarity about the

1:43:13.120 --> 1:43:19.520
 situation. But he also miss, he spoke, like we mentioned earlier, without grace, right?

1:43:20.800 --> 1:43:27.280
 But he was quickly punished by the administration because of a few people protesting. And just that

1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:36.880
 conversation, I guess what bothered me most is it didn't continue. It didn't expand. There was no

1:43:36.880 --> 1:43:44.560
 like complexity. And it was, there was a hunger that was clear behind that conversation, especially

1:43:44.560 --> 1:43:49.840
 sort of for me, I'd like to understand Marvin Minsky was one of the reasons I wanted to come

1:43:49.840 --> 1:43:56.400
 to MIT. He's passed away, but he's one of the key figures in the field that I deeply care about,

1:43:56.400 --> 1:44:03.840
 artificial intelligence. And I thought that his name was dragged through the mud,

1:44:03.840 --> 1:44:11.280
 through that situation, and without ever being like resolved. And so it's unclear to me, like,

1:44:11.280 --> 1:44:18.400
 what am I supposed to think about all this? And the only way to come to a conclusion there is to

1:44:18.400 --> 1:44:22.880
 keep talking. It's like the thing we started this conversation with about truth is like,

1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:30.480
 is conversation. So in that sense, I'd love if people on Librex, perhaps in other places,

1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:36.800
 but it seems like Librex is a nice platform to discuss Marvin Minsky, to discuss Jeffrey Epstein,

1:44:36.800 --> 1:44:42.880
 to learn from it, to grow from it, to see how we can make MIT better. As I'm still one of the

1:44:42.880 --> 1:44:49.040
 people, I've always dreamed of being at MIT and it was a dream come true in many ways. And I still

1:44:49.040 --> 1:44:54.400
 believe that MIT is one of the most special places in this world. Like many other universities,

1:44:54.400 --> 1:45:01.360
 universities in general is truly special, man. It hurts my heart when people speak poorly of

1:45:01.360 --> 1:45:06.880
 academia. I understand what they mean. They're very correct, but there is much more, in my opinion,

1:45:06.880 --> 1:45:12.800
 that's beautiful about academia than that's broken. I mean, I don't know if you have something to

1:45:12.800 --> 1:45:18.560
 comment. It doesn't necessarily need to be about Jeffrey Epstein, but there's these difficult things

1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:26.080
 that come up that test the academic community, right? That it feels like conversation is the

1:45:26.080 --> 1:45:33.040
 only way to resolve it. I think people have a natural need for closure. And it's not just,

1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:38.880
 I'm not as plugged into the, what academics are talking about as you would be Lux, but I even...

1:45:38.880 --> 1:45:45.440
 In case these days, no respect for Minsky. Exactly. I mean, especially in the AI community,

1:45:45.440 --> 1:45:53.280
 I'm not necessarily a programmer. But what I will say is that people come to Librex and

1:45:53.280 --> 1:45:58.400
 we always see a huge spike in users whenever there's a tragedy on campus or something where

1:45:58.400 --> 1:46:05.280
 people need closure. Recently, there was a suicide just the other day on Yale's campus,

1:46:05.840 --> 1:46:13.200
 and people were just coming to pay respects and to say, rest in peace, and speak also about

1:46:13.200 --> 1:46:22.080
 what might've led to an environment where people are drawn to these terrible results.

1:46:23.440 --> 1:46:28.800
 So just having a conversation is important there, because it brings closure.

1:46:28.800 --> 1:46:34.480
 People need the space, especially when no one wants to go out and put their head above,

1:46:34.480 --> 1:46:41.520
 be the longest blade of grass on that one because of the stigma. People need to be able to speak.

1:46:41.520 --> 1:46:46.320
 Yeah, that fear really bothers me, the fear that silences people. Like, were they self censor? Were

1:46:46.320 --> 1:46:58.160
 they self silence? Well, you've created an amazing place. I'm kind of interested in your struggle and

1:46:58.160 --> 1:47:07.680
 your journey of creating positive incentives, because it's a problem in a very different domain

1:47:07.680 --> 1:47:16.960
 that I'm also interested in. So I love robotics. I love human robot interaction. And so I believe

1:47:16.960 --> 1:47:21.760
 that most people are good and we can bring out the best in human nature. Social networks is a very

1:47:21.760 --> 1:47:25.840
 tricky space to do that in. So I'm glad you're taking on the problem and I'm glad you have the

1:47:25.840 --> 1:47:33.600
 mission that you do. I hope you succeed. But you mentioned offline that you used to be into chess.

1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:37.920
 Tell me about your journey through chess. Sure. I was a very competitive tournament player growing

1:47:37.920 --> 1:47:45.280
 up till about like 13. I got for the chess fans, I got to around 2000. USCF. So I was a competitive

1:47:45.280 --> 1:47:53.360
 player, especially my age group. And that actually led me to poker. I was I was playing a tournament.

1:47:53.360 --> 1:47:57.040
 And what happens is when you're like a very strong 13 year old and you're playing locally,

1:47:57.040 --> 1:48:01.120
 if you want a good match, you're gonna end up playing a lot of adults and you're gonna end up

1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:04.960
 playing if you want a good match, you're gonna end up playing a lot of adults. And I ended up

1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:12.000
 playing this mid 40s guy who we played a really strong game. He actually beat me. I still I still

1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:16.720
 remember the game and think I could I should have played that move instead of that one. But after

1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:20.880
 after the game, we had a postmortem. It was this me I think I was 13 at the time and this 40 year

1:48:20.880 --> 1:48:26.240
 old like hanging over this chessboard and looking over the moves. And even at that even at my age,

1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:31.600
 that this guy was absolutely brilliant. Yes. And after after the postmortem, not only by the way,

1:48:31.600 --> 1:48:36.960
 in chess, but just like in the way he articulates his thoughts, as some people are. After postmortem,

1:48:36.960 --> 1:48:40.320
 I went and looked him up online, I found out that he was a World Series of Poker Champion.

1:48:41.520 --> 1:48:47.120
 And his name is Bill Chen. Oh, wow. And I haven't really kept up with him, except one time there

1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:53.520
 was another chess tournament when I was around 14. And I followed him into an elevator as he was

1:48:53.520 --> 1:48:57.680
 leaving the chess hall, like pretending that I was going to go up just because I wanted to,

1:48:57.680 --> 1:49:01.920
 I just wanted to talk to him. And I suggested a sequel or some changes that he could that I

1:49:01.920 --> 1:49:05.120
 thought he could make for his book. And he was like, actually, I was thinking of doing the same

1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:10.640
 thing, which is incredibly validating to my 14 year old or 15 year old self. But I really haven't

1:49:10.640 --> 1:49:15.920
 kept up with him. So shout out to him. But and then that he wrote a book called the mathematics

1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:21.680
 of poker that I started reading. And that, first of all, kickstarted my interest in game theory.

1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:28.320
 And second of all, in poker. So it started from chess and then poker. And I started with Bitcoin

1:49:28.320 --> 1:49:35.920
 poker and had a lot of success with that met a lot of amazing friends. Learned a ton about I mean,

1:49:35.920 --> 1:49:41.120
 I think about entrepreneurship as well as taking risks, reasonable risks, positive expected value

1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:48.960
 risks. And also just growing as a person and mathematician. And what did you say Bitcoin

1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:54.080
 poker? Yeah, what's Bitcoin poker? So you have to understand I was 14 years old, right? Yes. So how

1:49:54.080 --> 1:49:58.960
 is a 14 year old with wonderful parents who care about him? Yeah. And probably don't want him

1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:05.600
 playing poker. Yeah. Going to start playing poker, because I wanted I wanted to challenge I love the

1:50:05.600 --> 1:50:12.720
 challenge of the competition. And I realized the answer is probably Bitcoin. Because the implications

1:50:12.720 --> 1:50:17.840
 of that. And they had they had these free roll tournaments, which for those who don't know what

1:50:17.840 --> 1:50:22.080
 free rolls are, there's these promotional tournaments that sites put on where they'll

1:50:22.080 --> 1:50:27.280
 put like a few dollars in and then 1000s of people sign up and the winners get like a dollar.

1:50:27.280 --> 1:50:33.040
 And I started there and I worked my way up. And that's amazing. What's your sense about from that

1:50:33.040 --> 1:50:40.880
 time to today of the growth of the cryptocurrency community? I'm actually having like four or five

1:50:40.880 --> 1:50:47.840
 conversations with Bitcoin proponents, Bitcoin maximalists, and like all these I'm just having

1:50:47.840 --> 1:50:53.920
 all these cryptocurrency conversations currently, because there's so many brilliant, like technically

1:50:53.920 --> 1:50:58.960
 brilliant, but also financially and philosophically brilliant people in those communities. It's

1:50:58.960 --> 1:51:04.640
 fascinating with the explosion of impact, like and also, if you look into the future, the possible

1:51:04.640 --> 1:51:09.840
 revolutionary impact on society in general, but what's your sense about this whole growth of

1:51:09.840 --> 1:51:16.560
 Bitcoin? I'm definitely less knowledgeable on the currency. Again, like programming, it was a means

1:51:16.560 --> 1:51:22.080
 to an end. Yes. Right. What I will say is that there was this amazing community that grew out of

1:51:22.080 --> 1:51:28.720
 it. And you'd have people who were willing to stake me or have me be their horse and they're my

1:51:28.720 --> 1:51:37.280
 backer. For having never met me for literally full Bitcoin tournaments, like full Bitcoin entry fee

1:51:37.280 --> 1:51:42.000
 tournaments, and I get a percentage of the profits and they get a percentage. And to have that level

1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:48.640
 of community for that degree of money, I mean, it gives you hope about the potential for, you know,

1:51:48.640 --> 1:51:56.160
 humans to act in mutual best interest with a degree of trust. Yeah, there's a really fascinating,

1:51:56.160 --> 1:52:00.640
 strong community there. But speaking of like bringing out the best of human nature,

1:52:00.640 --> 1:52:07.840
 it's a community that's currently struggling a little bit in terms of their ability to communicate

1:52:07.840 --> 1:52:15.520
 in a positive, inspiring way. Like the Bitcoin folks, and we talk about this a lot. I honestly

1:52:15.520 --> 1:52:22.480
 think they have a lot of love in their hearts and minds, but they just kind of naturally,

1:52:22.480 --> 1:52:31.360
 naturally, because the world has been like institutions and the centralized powers have been

1:52:32.160 --> 1:52:39.360
 sort of mocking and fighting them for many years that they've become sort of worn down and cynical.

1:52:39.360 --> 1:52:44.560
 And so they tend to be a little bit more aggressive and negative on the internet in the

1:52:44.560 --> 1:52:49.280
 way they communicate, especially on Twitter. And it's just created this whole community of

1:52:49.280 --> 1:52:55.360
 of basically being derisive and mocking and trolling and all this kind of stuff.

1:52:55.360 --> 1:53:00.160
 But people are trying to, you know, as the Bitcoin community grows, as the cryptocurrency community

1:53:00.160 --> 1:53:05.840
 grows, they're trying to revolutionize that aspect too. So they're trying to find the positive core

1:53:05.840 --> 1:53:12.800
 and grow and grow in that way. So it's fascinating because I think all of us are trying to find the

1:53:12.800 --> 1:53:18.800
 positive aspects of ourselves and trying to learn how to communicate in a positive way online.

1:53:18.800 --> 1:53:22.480
 It's like the internet hasn't been around. Social networks haven't been around that long. We're

1:53:22.480 --> 1:53:28.080
 trying to figure this thing out. Let me ask you the ridiculous question. I don't know if you

1:53:28.080 --> 1:53:33.520
 have an answer, but who is the greatest chess player of all time in your view? So since you

1:53:33.520 --> 1:53:39.920
 like chess. That's how you define it. But if you're talking about raw skill, like if you put everyone

1:53:39.920 --> 1:53:44.560
 across time into a torment together, Carlson would win. I don't think that's particularly

1:53:44.560 --> 1:53:51.280
 controversial. Oh, you mean like with the same exact skill level? Exactly. Now if you talk about

1:53:51.280 --> 1:53:58.640
 political importance, I think Bobby Fischer is, you know, he's the only one that people still,

1:53:58.640 --> 1:54:02.720
 when you go to someone on the street, they know Bobby Fischer because of what he represented,

1:54:02.720 --> 1:54:08.160
 right? Who do you think is more famous on the street? Garry Kasparov or Bobby Fischer?

1:54:08.160 --> 1:54:12.880
 Bobby Fischer. In America, Bobby Fischer. You think so? Yes. That's interesting. I think we're

1:54:12.880 --> 1:54:17.360
 gonna have to put that to the test. Yeah, maybe it's more reflective of the community that I was

1:54:17.360 --> 1:54:22.720
 a part of, but yeah. Oh, so in the community you're a part of like Young Minds playing chess,

1:54:22.720 --> 1:54:27.440
 Bobby Fischer was a superstar in terms of the roots. Yeah, I think so because he's American

1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:35.520
 and, you know, he stood up against the big bad Russians at the time and, you know, unfortunately

1:54:35.520 --> 1:54:43.520
 he had a very bad downfall. But, you know, for our geopolitical situation, he meant a lot. And then

1:54:43.520 --> 1:54:49.280
 if you talk about compared to contemporaries, actually, I would say Paul Morphy was a bit of

1:54:49.280 --> 1:54:55.040
 a throwback. He's one of those geniuses that was just head and shoulders above everyone else.

1:54:56.320 --> 1:55:00.720
 Is there somebody that inspired your own play, like as a Young Mind? Yeah, I really liked

1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:08.960
 Mikhail Tal. I think he was very aggressive, right? Yeah, very tactical. Which is funny because I

1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:14.960
 found that I was better at like sort of slow methodical play than quick tactics, but I just,

1:55:14.960 --> 1:55:18.480
 I mean, there's something beautiful about the creativity and that's something I always latched

1:55:18.480 --> 1:55:23.600
 onto as being a creative player, being a creative person. I mean, chess doesn't really reward

1:55:23.600 --> 1:55:28.640
 creativity as much as a lot of other things, especially entrepreneurial pursuits, which I

1:55:28.640 --> 1:55:35.040
 think is part of the reason why I sort of grew out of it. But I always was attracted to the

1:55:35.040 --> 1:55:41.440
 creativity that I did see in chess. So let me ask the flip, the other, because you said poker,

1:55:41.440 --> 1:55:46.640
 is there somebody that stands out to you as could be the greatest poker player of all time? Like

1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:55.360
 who do you admire? That's a more controversial one because these chess players are such like,

1:55:55.360 --> 1:55:59.440
 first of all, there's more an objective standard. And second of all, there's like,

1:55:59.440 --> 1:56:04.720
 they're like almost like cultural figures to me. Whereas poker players are more like live,

1:56:05.280 --> 1:56:09.680
 living. They feel more like, yeah, they feel more accessible. But they also have like

1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:18.160
 personalities in poker. They have vices, they have quirks, they have humor. Like,

1:56:18.160 --> 1:56:23.360
 I guess we've seen videos of them because it's such a recent development. I'll say one person

1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:29.360
 who I admire so much. And like, if I could like have a dinner list of people that I want to have

1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:35.360
 dinner with, like maybe it'll happen now, actually. I would love to have dinner with him. Phil

1:56:35.360 --> 1:56:44.160
 Galfond, who most people probably won't know. But on this podcast, but the way, first of all,

1:56:44.160 --> 1:56:49.600
 he democratized poker learning in like the mathematical nitty gritty, how do you get good

1:56:49.600 --> 1:56:57.120
 at poker type sense to the entire world in like an unprecedented way. He gave, he had this gift

1:56:57.120 --> 1:57:01.040
 that he had learned and distilled by working with some of the greatest poker minds. And he

1:57:01.040 --> 1:57:09.440
 just democratized it through his website. And I learned a ton from him. And not only that,

1:57:09.440 --> 1:57:13.840
 but you just listen to him think. And it's almost like a philosophical meditation,

1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:18.240
 the way that he breaks things down and thinks about these different elements and has such a

1:57:18.240 --> 1:57:24.560
 holistic thought process. It's like watching a genius work. And, you know, he's also just a nice,

1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:30.560
 fun, sociable guy that like, you can, you can imagine being at your dinner table. So all that

1:57:30.560 --> 1:57:34.720
 combined. Which is not true for a lot of poker players, right? A lot of them are dark souls.

1:57:34.720 --> 1:57:41.360
 To say the least, yes. I like, I really like the, what is he, Canadian Daniel Negrano.

1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:45.760
 He's also a nice guy. He's also a nice guy, but he's also somebody who's able to express his

1:57:45.760 --> 1:57:51.040
 thoughts about poker really well, but also in an entertaining way. He seems to be able to predict

1:57:51.040 --> 1:57:57.040
 cards better than anybody I've ever seen. Like what. Did you watch the challenge? Which challenge?

1:57:57.040 --> 1:58:03.440
 He, he lost like a million dollars recently to Doug Polk. He lost a million dollars to Doug Polk,

1:58:03.440 --> 1:58:09.120
 heads up online. It's really interesting. Yeah. It's, it's awesome to watch these guys work.

1:58:09.120 --> 1:58:17.600
 So I know you're 20, 21. 21. 21. So, so asking you for advice is, is a little bit funny, but,

1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:25.280
 but at the same time, not because you've created a social network. You've created a startup from

1:58:25.280 --> 1:58:30.800
 nothing as we talked about earlier, like without knowing how to program you've programmed. I mean,

1:58:30.800 --> 1:58:34.720
 you've taken this whole journey that a lot of people I think would be really inspired by.

1:58:34.720 --> 1:58:40.000
 So given that, and given the fact that 20 years from now, you probably laugh at the

1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:44.720
 advice you're going to give now. Absolutely. I hope so. If I don't laugh at the advice I give now,

1:58:44.720 --> 1:58:51.840
 something went desperately wrong, right? Yeah. So do you have advice for people that want to

1:58:51.840 --> 1:58:58.400
 follow in your footsteps and create a startup, whether it's in a software app domain or whether

1:58:58.400 --> 1:59:05.280
 it's anything else. So I'll speak specifically about social media apps. Yes. Try to keep it as

1:59:05.280 --> 1:59:12.000
 narrow as possible so I can laugh as little as possible when I'm 41. And what I would say is that

1:59:13.120 --> 1:59:18.240
 if you're like a 21, 22 year old, who's looking at me and being like, I want to do something like

1:59:18.240 --> 1:59:25.920
 this. What I would say is you probably know better than just about anyone. And if you have a feeling

1:59:25.920 --> 1:59:31.120
 in yourself that this is something that I have to do, and this is something I could imagine myself

1:59:31.120 --> 1:59:35.680
 doing for the next 10 years, because if you're successful, you are going to have to do it for

1:59:35.680 --> 1:59:40.800
 the next 10 years. And through the ups and the downs, through the amazing interviews with Lex,

1:59:40.800 --> 1:59:47.520
 and through the not so amazing articles you might have with other people, right? And you're going to

1:59:47.520 --> 1:59:51.520
 have to ride those highs and lows and you have to believe in what you're doing. But if you have that

1:59:51.520 --> 1:59:58.160
 feeling, what I would say is listen to as few people as possible, because people are experts

1:59:58.160 --> 2:00:04.480
 in domains. But when it comes to what's hot and what makes sense in a social context,

2:00:05.920 --> 2:00:12.000
 you are the authority as a young person who's going through these things and living in your

2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:21.760
 sort of milieu. And I mean, I've talked to, at this point, you know, so many experts, so many

2:00:21.760 --> 2:00:29.280
 investors, VCs. You'd be amazed at the advice I've gotten. Advice I've gotten.

2:00:29.280 --> 2:00:32.240
 So there's like a minefield of bad advice.

2:00:32.240 --> 2:00:37.680
 That's the hardest part, I think, for young people. And it's the thing, when people, like,

2:00:37.680 --> 2:00:43.200
 I help Yellies all the time who ask, like, I never turn down, when a founder asks me to have a

2:00:43.200 --> 2:00:48.960
 conversation, I never turn it down. I'm always there for them. And the number one thing I worry

2:00:48.960 --> 2:00:55.840
 about is that at Yale, we're taught implicitly and explicitly that you listen to the adult in the

2:00:55.840 --> 2:01:02.720
 room, you listen to the person with the highest, you know, pay grade. And it's devastating, because

2:01:02.720 --> 2:01:10.640
 that's how innovation dies. And, you know, yeah, it's intimidating to, like, you talk to VC who

2:01:10.640 --> 2:01:16.720
 probably means worth a billion dollars, a billion dollars, and they're going to tell you, you know,

2:01:16.720 --> 2:01:21.600
 all the, all the successful startups they have funders or even just a successful business owner,

2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:28.480
 uh, is going to tell you some advice and it's hard psychologically to think that they might be wrong.

2:01:28.480 --> 2:01:31.680
 Yeah, but you're saying that's the only way you succeed.

2:01:31.680 --> 2:01:35.280
 The only way you succeed, because if they knew what they were doing, they would have built it

2:01:35.280 --> 2:01:41.520
 themselves. Um, and what's especially hard is people go, oh, of course, you know,

2:01:42.080 --> 2:01:45.440
 I'll listen to people's, I'll listen to their advice, but I'll know why it's wrong.

2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:50.240
 And then I'll, and I'll do my own thing. And that sounds great in the abstract, but sometimes you

2:01:50.240 --> 2:01:54.720
 can't always even put your finger on why they're wrong. And I think to have the conviction,

2:01:54.720 --> 2:02:01.680
 to say, you're wrong and I can't tell you why, but I still think I'm right. It's a rare thing,

2:02:01.680 --> 2:02:07.120
 especially at like, it's very counterintuitive. And you might even say it's hubris or arrogant,

2:02:07.680 --> 2:02:12.560
 but I think it's necessary because a lot of these things are, they're not things that you can really

2:02:13.760 --> 2:02:19.120
 put into words until you see them in action. Like a lot of them are kind of happy accidents.

2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:25.040
 Yeah. It's been, it's been tough for me, like as a, as a person who, um, like I'm very empathetic.

2:02:25.040 --> 2:02:33.200
 So I, when people tell me stuff, I kind of want to understand them. And it's been a painful process,

2:02:33.200 --> 2:02:38.400
 especially people close to me, basically everything I've done, and especially in the

2:02:38.400 --> 2:02:45.040
 recent few years, a lot of people close to me said not to do, you know, and, uh, like,

2:02:45.040 --> 2:02:54.400
 my parents too, that's been a hard one is, is to basically acknowledge to myself that you don't know,

2:02:55.440 --> 2:03:03.040
 like, you, you don't, that everything you're going to say by way of advice for me is not going to be

2:03:03.040 --> 2:03:10.160
 helpful. Like, I love my parents very much, but like, they're just like, they don't get it.

2:03:10.160 --> 2:03:16.480
 And, and as you put it beautifully, it's very difficult to put your finger on exactly why,

2:03:17.440 --> 2:03:23.440
 because, uh, a lot of advice sounds reasonable. That's the worst kind. Yeah.

2:03:25.440 --> 2:03:31.280
 Uh, if it, if it sounds really good, that just means it's an earworm. Like, that's like a song

2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:35.040
 that you hear on the radio and then you're like, you're humming it in the car and it's like,

2:03:35.040 --> 2:03:41.920
 it's the same thing. The more, the better it sounds, the more skeptical. Yeah. Reason is a,

2:03:41.920 --> 2:03:47.920
 is a bad drug. Like, should be very careful because, like, you know, the things that seem

2:03:47.920 --> 2:03:55.440
 impossible, every, every major innovation, every major business seems impossible at birth. But

2:03:55.440 --> 2:03:59.760
 even not just the impossible things, I think, you know, you look at like love, for example,

2:03:59.760 --> 2:04:07.760
 it's very easy to give advice, to sort of point out all the ways you can go wrong or marriage,

2:04:07.760 --> 2:04:13.840
 all the divorces that people go through, all the pain of years that you go through the divorce,

2:04:13.840 --> 2:04:19.280
 like the system of marriage, the marriage industrial complex, all the money that's wasted,

2:04:19.280 --> 2:04:24.640
 all those kinds of things. But that advice is useless when you're in love. I guess the best

2:04:24.640 --> 2:04:30.320
 the point is to just pat the person on the back and say, go get him, kid. Like, what is it? Good

2:04:30.320 --> 2:04:39.200
 Will Hunting. I went to see about a girl. Yeah. That's a good movie. I love that movie. But yeah,

2:04:39.200 --> 2:04:44.560
 that, that's, that took me a long time to figure out. I'm still trying to fight through it,

2:04:44.560 --> 2:04:53.120
 but especially when you're young, that's hard. But, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

2:04:53.120 --> 2:05:00.000
 but, uh, nothing in life is, uh, worth accomplishing is easy. So,

2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:03.440
 but I think it's really interesting. You make that connection between like startup advice

2:05:03.440 --> 2:05:09.040
 and like your parents, because it's the exact same sort of mechanism where when you're young,

2:05:09.040 --> 2:05:14.560
 your parents are usually like, right. Right. And the experts are usually right. And, you know,

2:05:14.560 --> 2:05:18.320
 if you listen to them and you, you, you follow their orders, you're going to go to a school

2:05:18.320 --> 2:05:25.360
 like Yale and at a certain point stops making sense. And I've, I've seen my friends at Yale

2:05:25.360 --> 2:05:28.960
 go down paths because they just continued listening to their parents that

2:05:29.840 --> 2:05:32.960
 I know in their heart of hearts is not the right path for them.

2:05:33.840 --> 2:05:42.320
 Yeah. You know what? That's how I see like the education system. The whole point is to guide you

2:05:42.320 --> 2:05:51.600
 to a certain point in your life. And everybody's point is different. And your task is to,

2:05:51.600 --> 2:05:57.040
 at that point, to have a personal revolution and create your own path. But no one tells you that.

2:05:57.040 --> 2:06:00.800
 Nobody tells you that because they're, they want you to keep following the same path as they,

2:06:00.800 --> 2:06:05.520
 they're leading you towards. Like they're not going to say your whole job is to eventually

2:06:05.520 --> 2:06:11.520
 rebel. Yeah. That's how revolution, that's how rebellion works. You're not supposed to be told,

2:06:11.520 --> 2:06:16.000
 but that is the task. They can take you just like you said, and depending who you are,

2:06:16.720 --> 2:06:21.520
 they can take you really far. But at a certain point you have to rebel. That could be getting

2:06:21.520 --> 2:06:25.760
 your PhD, that could be in your undergrad, that could be high school. Yeah. It could be any point.

2:06:25.760 --> 2:06:30.480
 One thing that I think played a pretty pivotal role, and I've never really mentioned this,

2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:37.120
 he might not even know the person about to tell you about, in sort of me actually going out and

2:06:37.120 --> 2:06:45.200
 making Librex was that I was taking this graduate level math class, my sophomore year. And I met

2:06:45.200 --> 2:06:53.200
 this, I met this PhD student who was also in it and had considerable citations and also startup

2:06:53.200 --> 2:06:59.040
 experience. And I think he actually ended up being the CTO of a unicorn later on. I've sort of lost

2:06:59.040 --> 2:07:06.640
 touch with him, but we're still Facebook friends as it is in the 21st century. So, and I was in a

2:07:06.640 --> 2:07:10.240
 class and I was telling him, I really want to, I really want to make this thing, but I have no

2:07:10.240 --> 2:07:18.400
 technical background. And he, this guy's a computer genius. He worked under Dan Spielman at Yale. So

2:07:19.280 --> 2:07:23.360
 he's a good guy. Right. And we were doing some math together. We were doing something on

2:07:23.360 --> 2:07:31.280
 discrepancy for those of you who really care about math. So combinatorics. And he just turns to me,

2:07:31.280 --> 2:07:35.360
 he's like, I think you could do it. Like, what do you mean you think I could do? He's like,

2:07:35.360 --> 2:07:40.320
 I think you could do it. And I was like, really? But I respected this guy so much.

2:07:41.120 --> 2:07:46.480
 His name was Young Duck. Shout out to Young Duck. I respected this guy so much that I was like,

2:07:46.480 --> 2:07:51.600
 if Young Duck says I can do it and Young Duck is a legit genius and he knows, and he knows me,

2:07:52.160 --> 2:07:55.280
 because we were in two classes together and we'd spent a lot of time together.

2:07:55.280 --> 2:07:59.120
 If he thinks I can do it, then who am I to say I can't do it?

2:07:59.120 --> 2:08:05.360
 Yeah. You know, that's a lesson for mentorship is like, by the way, he has no idea probably.

2:08:06.560 --> 2:08:10.720
 Well, he might not even remember that interaction, which is funny. But the point is

2:08:11.760 --> 2:08:19.760
 that when a crazy young kid comes up to you with a crazy dream, you know, every once in a while,

2:08:19.760 --> 2:08:25.440
 you should just pat him on the back and say, I believe in you. Like you can do it. If they look

2:08:25.440 --> 2:08:31.920
 up to you, that means your words have power. And if you say, no, no, come on, be like reasonable,

2:08:32.560 --> 2:08:39.040
 like, you know, finish your schoolwork kind of thing. Like that's, that's unreasonable to take

2:08:39.040 --> 2:08:43.440
 that leap now. Just finish your education, blah, blah, blah, whatever, whatever the reasonable

2:08:43.440 --> 2:08:50.080
 advice is every once in a while, maybe often as a mentor, you should say, you know, go see about a

2:08:50.080 --> 2:08:56.400
 girl in California or whatever the equivalent is. That was my moment. That was my good will hunting

2:08:56.400 --> 2:09:02.080
 moment. That's your good will hunting moment. Man, I miss Robin Williams. I was a special guy.

2:09:03.520 --> 2:09:08.640
 People love it when I ask about book recommendations in general. Of course,

2:09:08.640 --> 2:09:12.640
 your journey is just beginning. But is there something that jumps out to you? Technical,

2:09:12.640 --> 2:09:18.240
 fiction, philosophical, sci fi, coloring books, blog posts you read somewhere

2:09:18.240 --> 2:09:25.920
 that had an impact on your life? Video games. Video games that you recommend to others. Minecraft,

2:09:26.720 --> 2:09:31.760
 manual. Manga. I mean, yeah, video, you could mention video games too,

2:09:31.760 --> 2:09:35.040
 if there's something that jumps out to you that just had like an impact.

2:09:36.800 --> 2:09:43.440
 I guess I'll say I really liked the book, The War of Art, which is a book about creative resistance

2:09:43.440 --> 2:09:49.280
 and the creative struggle and what it means to be creative. And part of what I see in this

2:09:49.280 --> 2:09:55.040
 conversation and what you're doing, Lex, is so much of The War of Art's idea is that you just

2:09:55.040 --> 2:10:03.040
 keep writing and writing and writing until you get to the new crap. And you just roll with it,

2:10:03.040 --> 2:10:07.840
 right? And that's sort of what happens when you have like three hour conversations with people is

2:10:07.840 --> 2:10:14.320
 you can only have so much scripted or societally constructed stuff until you get to the real you.

2:10:15.120 --> 2:10:18.960
 And you have to show up. I mean, that book is kind of painful.

2:10:18.960 --> 2:10:22.480
 It's really painful. And it's not something I would recommend for every part of it,

2:10:22.480 --> 2:10:27.280
 but for what it did in my life at the time. It also kind of normalized, I don't know,

2:10:28.960 --> 2:10:35.520
 part of my coming of age story is part of it's about realizing that I'm a creative person and

2:10:35.520 --> 2:10:41.760
 person who needs to create. That's sort of a God given thing, I think, for a lot of people.

2:10:41.760 --> 2:10:46.240
 But it's something that I don't really feel like I can live without. And part of it was realizing

2:10:46.240 --> 2:10:50.160
 that even within some of these more rigid structures, it's okay that I don't sort of

2:10:50.880 --> 2:10:55.840
 fit in with them. And to hear about the struggles of other creatives was something for my own

2:10:55.840 --> 2:11:01.360
 self esteem and my own growing up that was really important to me. So I don't think the book itself

2:11:01.360 --> 2:11:06.160
 might be perfect, but for what it did for my life, it was really impactful.

2:11:06.960 --> 2:11:13.440
 Yeah, I think exactly. The words may not be exactly right by way of advice, but I think

2:11:13.440 --> 2:11:20.880
 the journey that a lot of creatives take by reading that book is kind of profound. He also

2:11:20.880 --> 2:11:26.800
 has another one called Turning Pro, I think. I mean, he in general espouses like taking it

2:11:26.800 --> 2:11:32.240
 seriously. If you have a creative mind and you want to create something special in this world,

2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:38.320
 go do it. Don't show up. Look at that blank page.

2:11:38.320 --> 2:11:45.600
 So many people would tell me, would encourage me either blatantly or through implicit means

2:11:45.600 --> 2:11:53.680
 to basically take the Apple S seriously. It's a good signal, by the way. It's a good signal

2:11:53.680 --> 2:11:58.160
 because my really close friends, the ones who have always supported me, they never said that

2:11:58.160 --> 2:12:03.280
 because they got it. They understood that that was my path. And they might be skeptical. They might

2:12:03.280 --> 2:12:09.120
 be like, I mean, one of my friends I remember told me, I was always taken aback about why you

2:12:09.120 --> 2:12:14.640
 were so certain this would work out. And he's like, I finally got it once I saw it popping off,

2:12:14.640 --> 2:12:20.720
 but before that, I just didn't get it. But he still supported me. And I think it's a really

2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:27.120
 good signal. And actually just the fact of going through this process has made me socially feel so

2:12:27.120 --> 2:12:31.840
 much more connected. And I've somewhat consolidated my social life to some degree, but it's so much

2:12:31.840 --> 2:12:36.800
 more vulnerable, connected. And that's part of the creative process. I have to thank for that,

2:12:36.800 --> 2:12:42.720
 I think. There's something that's unstoppable about the creative mind. It's right there,

2:12:42.720 --> 2:12:49.360
 that fire. And I guess part of the thing that you're supposed to do is let that fire burn.

2:12:49.360 --> 2:12:54.480
 In whichever direction. And it's going to hurt. It's going to hurt. Fire will hurt.

2:12:55.360 --> 2:12:58.560
 But on the topic of video games, you mentioned the Stanley Parable offline.

2:13:00.640 --> 2:13:04.720
 You said you played some video games. Is there a video game that you especially love that you

2:13:04.720 --> 2:13:10.880
 recommend I play, for example? Yeah, I'll mention. It's actually really in keeping with what we've

2:13:10.880 --> 2:13:16.560
 been talking about. It's the Beginner's Guide, which was made by the same guy, Davey Rendon,

2:13:16.560 --> 2:13:22.480
 who made the Stanley Parable, which I briefly saw you. I just clicked the video and then I went to

2:13:22.480 --> 2:13:32.480
 sleep. It was like 2 a.m. But I briefly saw that you were looking at. And it's a game that is

2:13:32.480 --> 2:13:40.000
 better treated as art. And I think I won't claim to understand the creator, because that would be

2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:48.640
 a cardinal sin to me as a creative person. But it gets to the heart of a lot of the things that

2:13:49.840 --> 2:13:54.960
 we've been talking about, which is the creative mind. The game can be interpreted in a lot of

2:13:54.960 --> 2:14:00.880
 ways in a feminist way. It could be interpreted as a story of friends. It could be interpreted

2:14:01.520 --> 2:14:07.520
 as the story of critics versus a creative. The way I like to interpret it, and I don't want to

2:14:07.520 --> 2:14:16.240
 give away too much, is the story of the creative part of your mind that creates just for the sake

2:14:16.240 --> 2:14:24.560
 of creating. Meaning the part that creates for no rhyme or reason or clear meaning. It's almost

2:14:24.560 --> 2:14:32.080
 ethereal. Versus the part that's, you could call it the editor. You could call it the pragmatist.

2:14:32.080 --> 2:14:38.640
 You could call it the necessary force of ego in our lives. We can't totally be egoless, right?

2:14:38.640 --> 2:14:45.360
 But we need to be egoless to be creative. And how that sort of internal censure, what role does it

2:14:45.360 --> 2:14:50.560
 play? And how do we allow our creative minds to be creative? And yet, how do we still become useful?

2:14:52.960 --> 2:14:55.760
 And it's funny that a video game could have this in.

2:14:55.760 --> 2:15:02.480
 It's a fascinating tension, which reminds me about the ridiculous question that every once in a while

2:15:02.480 --> 2:15:11.280
 asks about meaning and death. So, this whole ride ends. You're at the beginning of the ride,

2:15:11.280 --> 2:15:17.360
 but it could end any day, actually. That's kind of the way human life works. You could die today,

2:15:17.360 --> 2:15:22.000
 you could die tomorrow. Do you think about your mortality? Do you think about death?

2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:29.600
 Do you meditate on it? And in that context, as the creative, but a pragmatist, too,

2:15:29.600 --> 2:15:33.840
 as running a startup, what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

2:15:35.840 --> 2:15:46.880
 Yeah, so, on mortality, right? About three years ago, four years ago now, I was excited to go to

2:15:46.880 --> 2:15:53.360
 Yale. I was playing six hours of squash a day, which squash is a sport I love so much. And I was

2:15:53.360 --> 2:15:58.480
 really getting a lot better. And I was even thinking I could maybe walk onto the Yale team.

2:16:00.960 --> 2:16:11.280
 And I woke up one day, I felt really, really sick. I went and I decided not to go squash that day.

2:16:11.280 --> 2:16:20.640
 I wanted to, I almost did. And you'll see how this story turns out. You'll decide if I made the right

2:16:20.640 --> 2:16:25.840
 choice. I decided not to go squash today. And I decided to get my driver's license, or I had to

2:16:25.840 --> 2:16:31.440
 get my driver's license because I wanted to get a driver's license before I went off to college,

2:16:31.440 --> 2:16:35.840
 because otherwise I might never get it. And I'm going back and I successfully got my driver's

2:16:35.840 --> 2:16:44.160
 license for Hashem. And I go back to my house and I decided I don't want to drive back because I

2:16:44.160 --> 2:16:50.160
 just feel so sick. Like things are spinning. I have the worst headache. I come home, I run back

2:16:50.160 --> 2:16:55.840
 right into my bed and feeling really sick to the point where I even like asked my mom who is a

2:16:55.840 --> 2:17:00.160
 doctor, I'm like, should I go to the hospital? And she's like, you can just wait it out and

2:17:00.160 --> 2:17:08.320
 she'll get better. And then, you know, and then at one point I look at my arms and they're like

2:17:08.320 --> 2:17:14.240
 covered in this like red splotchy stuff. Yeah. And I'm like, mom, I think. And she's like, yeah,

2:17:14.240 --> 2:17:20.160
 we have to go. And so I go there and they're like, you have scarlet fever. And they're like,

2:17:20.160 --> 2:17:24.320
 there's nothing we can do. You should probably just go back home. So I go back home. Six hours

2:17:24.320 --> 2:17:30.880
 later I wake up in the morning. They'd let me out at like 3 a.m. They let me, I come home in

2:17:30.880 --> 2:17:37.440
 the morning and I feel this, like a spear through my chest. And I never felt anything like it. And

2:17:37.440 --> 2:17:41.280
 I was, it was very disconcerting when you have a, cause we're all used to different sorts of pain,

2:17:41.280 --> 2:17:46.240
 right? And that was the sort of pain I never felt before. As far as an athlete, you're used to like,

2:17:46.240 --> 2:17:51.280
 you know, pain. So I told my parents and immediately we hop back in the car. We go up

2:17:51.280 --> 2:17:55.600
 to the same hospital I was at six hours ago. And they initially didn't want to let me in. And I

2:17:55.600 --> 2:17:58.880
 was like, I have chest pain. They're like, oh, come in. Cause they're like, you're a healthy guy,

2:17:58.880 --> 2:18:02.800
 wait your turn. And I'm like, no, you don't understand. I have like a pain in my chest.

2:18:02.800 --> 2:18:07.840
 And then they let me in. They start doing tests on me. They like put something like in my back,

2:18:07.840 --> 2:18:12.720
 which is really scary. It's a huge needle. And I'm smiling because it's like one of the ways

2:18:12.720 --> 2:18:17.280
 I reduce stress, I guess, or deal with this sort of thing and make light of it. But like,

2:18:17.280 --> 2:18:22.480
 you know, that, you know, it's definitely very scary in the moment, shocking and scary.

2:18:22.480 --> 2:18:28.160
 And they go and they, they do a bunch of tests and they determined that a virus like attacked

2:18:28.160 --> 2:18:35.520
 my heart and I had myocarditis and pericarditis. And they said I had maybe 25 to 35% chance at

2:18:35.520 --> 2:18:43.600
 one point of dying. And so I'm sitting in my, they admit me into the hospital. I'm in the bed,

2:18:43.600 --> 2:18:51.680
 in my bed for about three weeks. And I'm just, I'm just standing there. And I had this moment

2:18:51.680 --> 2:19:01.440
 also that I remember very specifically where I was in so much pain that like I was crying,

2:19:01.440 --> 2:19:07.920
 not out of like emotional standpoint, but actually just purely out of the pain itself. Like I could

2:19:07.920 --> 2:19:12.880
 feel my heart in my chest. And when I leaned back, I felt it touch my rib cage and feel horrible.

2:19:12.880 --> 2:19:17.200
 So I couldn't go to sleep and lean back. I had to lean forward all throughout the night. Right.

2:19:17.200 --> 2:19:21.520
 And I'm feeling my, and I'm feeling my chest. I'm feeling this terrible pain in my chest.

2:19:21.520 --> 2:19:28.080
 I'm crying unstoppably. And I mean, also maybe I should mention that at the time I was someone

2:19:28.080 --> 2:19:33.600
 who like refused to take in anything into my body that wasn't natural. And so a lot of the time I,

2:19:33.600 --> 2:19:40.160
 I tried to be unmedicated. Eventually I didn't allow them to add a little medication to my body,

2:19:40.160 --> 2:19:46.560
 but there's just so much uncertainty and pain. And the first time I had to come to terms with

2:19:46.560 --> 2:19:52.080
 mortality. First of all, I think you still should have gone and played squash. I mean, come on.

2:19:52.080 --> 2:19:58.640
 I mean, yeah. I thought you're serious about this. You still carry that with you sort of.

2:20:01.440 --> 2:20:08.960
 There is power to realizing the ride can end. Right. Very suddenly. Very suddenly. Yeah.

2:20:08.960 --> 2:20:16.720
 And painfully. And, you know, it, it has pragmatic application to like what you,

2:20:16.720 --> 2:20:19.280
 to trajectories you take through life. Right.

2:20:19.280 --> 2:20:27.120
 Something else that is worth noting is that I, for the next year, couldn't walk to my classes.

2:20:27.840 --> 2:20:35.280
 So I get to Yale, they put me in a medical single alone, and I have to get shuttled to all my

2:20:35.280 --> 2:20:39.120
 classes. I have to ask, I had to ask a few professors to even move classes so I could

2:20:39.120 --> 2:20:46.080
 actually get there. I can't move my book. I can't lift my book bags. I can't, I can't walk upstairs.

2:20:48.080 --> 2:20:55.440
 I spent like 12 hours a day in my dorm room, just like staring at the walls and more so. And more

2:20:55.440 --> 2:21:05.520
 than that, all this, like, you, I got to watch my body, like, deteriorate and like the muscle,

2:21:05.520 --> 2:21:11.680
 like fall off of it. Cause I was, I was taking these pills and they're kind of catabolic. And

2:21:11.680 --> 2:21:18.960
 for an 18 year old, I mean, I think every 18 year old has feelings about their body, man or woman.

2:21:18.960 --> 2:21:24.720
 And, you know, just seeing this, it's like, you're watching sort of death transpire. And it's like,

2:21:24.720 --> 2:21:30.640
 and you're also very fatigued because your heart's not at peak condition. And you're thinking about

2:21:30.640 --> 2:21:34.240
 the future and a lot of the things you enjoy have kind of been stripped away from you.

2:21:35.520 --> 2:21:43.360
 And I took up a meditation practice, like started with like five minutes a day. At my peak, I was at

2:21:43.360 --> 2:21:50.240
 like 40 minutes a day, kept it up consistently for about two years. And I started thinking about,

2:21:50.240 --> 2:21:57.600
 like, what do I want to do? And like, what do I care about? And to get to your point,

2:21:57.600 --> 2:22:05.440
 I think you were asking, like, how does this carry forward? Right? I think I realized that,

2:22:05.440 --> 2:22:10.480
 you know, there's an end and I realized that there are things I believe and things that I believe

2:22:10.480 --> 2:22:15.520
 that might not be so overtly popular, but that I truly think make the world a better place.

2:22:15.520 --> 2:22:21.920
 And in spite of, and then basically, if my conditions provided, I wanted to make something

2:22:21.920 --> 2:22:27.280
 that I wanted to do something that would make me feel sort of whole in that way.

2:22:28.080 --> 2:22:31.920
 Yeah. I mean, that's an amazing journey to take that time and to come out on the other end.

2:22:33.280 --> 2:22:37.920
 Now, man, that's amazing. I did not realize like that there was a long term struggle.

2:22:37.920 --> 2:22:45.280
 I think that's in the end, if you do succeed, will have a profound positive impact because

2:22:45.280 --> 2:22:53.600
 struggle is ultimately like humbling, but also empowering. So I'm glad to see that. But from the

2:22:53.600 --> 2:22:58.240
 perspective of the creator of the other ridiculous question about meaning, do you think about this

2:22:58.240 --> 2:23:08.800
 kind of stuff? Is that the, you know, the meaning of life for you, the meaning of life for us,

2:23:08.800 --> 2:23:13.760
 descendants of apes in general? The first thing I'd like to say is that I think part of like,

2:23:13.760 --> 2:23:17.680
 when we talk about the meaning of life, the part of it is the fact that we get to struggle with

2:23:17.680 --> 2:23:25.200
 this question and we get to do it together for a long time. And we sometimes, I think,

2:23:25.200 --> 2:23:28.800
 it's accepting that there's no meaning at all. And sometimes I think it's accepting that,

2:23:29.840 --> 2:23:34.080
 or even just parsing the phrase and thinking about the meaning of life. I sometimes I'm,

2:23:34.080 --> 2:23:41.120
 look, I'm very young. Again, I hope that anything I say now is going to be very different in the

2:23:41.120 --> 2:23:49.040
 future because I think life has so many meanings that it'll be crazy to see what I think in 20

2:23:49.040 --> 2:23:50.400
 years about the meaning of life.

2:23:50.400 --> 2:23:57.040
 Yeah, rise from the future, cut them some slack.

2:23:57.040 --> 2:24:05.120
 Please do. Perspective, perspective, perspective. Having said that, you know, I think part of what

2:24:05.120 --> 2:24:09.040
 brings meaning to my life is things like this, where we think about these things with people

2:24:09.040 --> 2:24:14.000
 who are really, really, really on the ball, and we get to connect with these people.

2:24:14.800 --> 2:24:17.200
 That certainly brings meaning to my life, human connection.

2:24:17.200 --> 2:24:23.600
 Yeah, this conversation is just another, like, echo of the thing you're trying to create

2:24:24.240 --> 2:24:30.720
 in a digital space, right? That's the same kind of magic. From what I understand about what you're

2:24:30.720 --> 2:24:36.240
 trying to create is the same reason I fell in love with the long form podcasting, like as a fan.

2:24:36.240 --> 2:24:42.400
 That's why I listen to long form podcasts. Is there something deeply human and genuine

2:24:42.400 --> 2:24:49.040
 about the interchange through their voice? But I do think that connection through text can be

2:24:49.680 --> 2:24:55.280
 even more powerful. Like I think about letters. I still write letters to Russia. You know,

2:24:55.280 --> 2:25:03.360
 there's something powerful in letters. When you put a lot of yourself in the words you say,

2:25:03.360 --> 2:25:10.480
 in the words you write, that's powerful. You can really communicate, not just the actual semantic

2:25:10.480 --> 2:25:18.160
 meaning of the words, but like a lot of who you are through those words and create real connection.

2:25:18.160 --> 2:25:26.960
 So I hope you succeed there. And listen, Ryan, I think this is an incredible conversation. I'm

2:25:26.960 --> 2:25:33.760
 glad that people like you are fighting the good fight for bringing out the best in human nature

2:25:33.760 --> 2:25:40.800
 in the digital space. I think that's a battleground where the good will win, like love will win. And

2:25:40.800 --> 2:25:45.680
 I'm glad you're creating technology that does just that. So thank you so much for wasting all

2:25:45.680 --> 2:25:50.400
 your time for coming down. I can't wait to see what you do in the future. Thanks for talking today.

2:25:50.400 --> 2:25:56.560
 Thank you for having me. Bam. How many finger guns have you gotten at the end of the podcast?

2:25:56.560 --> 2:26:04.720
 Zero. Two now. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ryan Shiller. And thank you

2:26:04.720 --> 2:26:12.080

2:26:12.080 --> 2:26:20.960
 podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from George Washington on March 15, 1783.

2:26:20.960 --> 2:26:28.640
 If freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led like sheep to the slaughter.

2:26:28.640 --> 2:26:50.640
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
