00:00.000 --> 00:03.720
 The following is a conversation with Niels Jorgensen,

00:03.720 --> 00:06.600
 a New York firefighter for over 21 years

00:06.600 --> 00:11.360
 who was there at Ground Zero on September 11th, 2001.

00:11.360 --> 00:14.160
 He was forced to retire because of the leukemia

00:14.160 --> 00:17.640
 he contracted from cleaning up Ground Zero.

00:17.640 --> 00:20.600
 This podcast tells his story,

00:20.600 --> 00:22.840
 and the story of other great men and women

00:22.840 --> 00:24.520
 who were there that day.

00:24.520 --> 00:26.080
 Some of the stories we talk about

00:26.080 --> 00:28.480
 are part of a new limited podcast series

00:28.480 --> 00:32.200
 that Niels hosts called 20 for 20,

00:32.200 --> 00:36.840
 with 20 episodes for the 20 years since 9 11.

00:36.840 --> 00:38.240

 please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:41.480 --> 00:44.520
 As a side note, please allow me to say a few words

00:44.520 --> 00:48.400
 about the terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001.

00:49.320 --> 00:51.720
 I was in downtown Chicago on that day,

00:51.720 --> 00:55.600
 lost in the mundane busyness of an early Tuesday morning.

00:55.600 --> 00:59.400
 At that time, I was already fascinated by human nature,

00:59.400 --> 01:02.000
 the best and the worst of it,

01:02.000 --> 01:04.960
 exploring it through the study of history and literature.

01:05.920 --> 01:09.320
 In the years before, as a young boy growing up in Russia,

01:09.320 --> 01:12.200
 I saw chaos, uncertainty, and desperation

01:12.200 --> 01:14.840
 in the Soviet Union of the 1990s,

01:14.840 --> 01:18.360
 wrapping up a century of war and suffering.

01:18.360 --> 01:20.600
 But after coming to America for me,

01:20.600 --> 01:24.600
 there was a sense of hope, like all of it was behind us,

01:24.600 --> 01:26.880
 a bad dream to be forgotten

01:26.880 --> 01:28.800
 as we enter into the new century.

01:29.880 --> 01:32.080
 On 9 11, when I saw the news

01:32.080 --> 01:34.440
 of the second plane hitting the towers,

01:34.440 --> 01:37.200
 my sense of hope had changed.

01:37.200 --> 01:40.040
 I understood that the 21st century,

01:40.040 --> 01:43.920
 like the century before, would too have its tragedies,

01:43.920 --> 01:48.320
 its evildoers, its wars, and its suffering.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.120
 And unlike the history books,

01:50.120 --> 01:53.240
 these stories will involve all of us.

01:53.240 --> 01:56.360
 They will involve me in however small

01:56.360 --> 01:58.400
 and insignificant a role,

01:58.400 --> 02:01.880
 but one that nevertheless carries the responsibility

02:01.880 --> 02:02.720
 to help.

02:03.680 --> 02:08.440
 I became an American that day, a citizen of the world.

02:08.440 --> 02:10.800
 I felt the common humanity in all of us.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.960
 I felt the unity and the love in the days that followed.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.600
 And I think most of the world shared in this feeling

02:16.600 --> 02:18.960
 that we are all in this together.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.280
 Evil cannot defeat the human spirit.

02:21.280 --> 02:24.960
 There were many heroes sung and unsung on that day

02:24.960 --> 02:27.080
 and in the years after.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.440
 Often politicians fail to rightfully honor the service

02:30.440 --> 02:32.920
 and sacrifice of these heroes.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.440
 There's much I could say about that,

02:35.440 --> 02:37.200
 but I don't want to waste my words

02:37.200 --> 02:39.720
 on the failures of weak leaders.

02:39.720 --> 02:41.920
 Instead, I want to say thank you

02:41.920 --> 02:45.040
 to the men and women who rushed to Ground Zero to help,

02:45.040 --> 02:47.160
 who put on a uniform to serve,

02:47.160 --> 02:50.760
 who make me proud to be an American and a human being,

02:50.760 --> 02:54.400
 and give me hope about the future of our civilization

02:54.400 --> 02:57.200
 here on a small spinning rock

02:57.200 --> 02:59.120
 that despite the long odds

02:59.120 --> 03:03.640
 keeps kindling the fire of human consciousness and love.

03:04.680 --> 03:06.920
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast

03:06.920 --> 03:10.440
 and here is my conversation with Niels Jorgensen.

03:11.440 --> 03:14.920
 Take me through the day of September 11th, 2001

03:14.920 --> 03:17.240
 as you experienced it, as you lived it.

03:17.240 --> 03:20.760
 September 11th, 2001 was a bright, beautiful,

03:20.760 --> 03:22.560
 sunny Tuesday morning.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.000
 It was a late summer.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.920
 There's a lot of folks who go to the beaches in New Jersey

03:27.920 --> 03:29.280
 and call it the short summer.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.720
 Everybody's left there for Labor Day,

03:30.720 --> 03:33.720
 but it's still beautiful enough to enjoy the weather.

03:35.160 --> 03:37.840
 I left my house about 6.30 in the morning

03:37.840 --> 03:42.600
 and my four and a half year old daughter said to me,

03:42.600 --> 03:47.200
 daddy, which truck are you driving today, the fire truck,

03:47.200 --> 03:49.240
 the oil truck, or the boar's head truck?

03:49.240 --> 03:51.920
 Because I had three jobs at the time.

03:52.960 --> 03:56.440
 Most New York City firefighters and police officers, EMS,

03:56.440 --> 03:58.720
 we don't make the most amount of money.

03:58.720 --> 04:01.840
 So in order to live in that city, you have to hustle.

04:01.840 --> 04:04.680
 And my wife stayed at home raising the children.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.920
 So my daughter said, oh, so you should be safe

04:08.920 --> 04:10.320
 because you're on the oil truck.

04:10.320 --> 04:13.080
 I told her I was going on the oil truck that day.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.920
 So she said, you should be safe today, daddy.

04:14.920 --> 04:18.200
 So I left and worked for this great company

04:18.200 --> 04:20.800
 on the North Shore, Staten Island, Quinlan Fuel.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.640
 Very nice people, treated me very well.

04:23.640 --> 04:26.720
 And it was my first day back actually for the winter season.

04:27.640 --> 04:30.000
 Usually get laid off a couple months in the summer

04:30.000 --> 04:32.240
 because things, you know, too hot to need oil.

04:33.360 --> 04:36.040
 So I took the truck, started my route that day

04:36.040 --> 04:38.760
 and plane to New Jersey.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.400
 And plane hit the tower.

04:42.320 --> 04:44.320
 So initially I'm like, oh, it's probably

04:44.320 --> 04:46.040
 some silly Lear jet pilot.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.240
 And he veered off track to get a better picture

04:48.240 --> 04:50.600
 for a client and he hit the building.

04:50.600 --> 04:55.320
 Probably hit a, you know, bad turbulence, gust of wind.

04:55.320 --> 04:57.280
 It's very windy down in that area in Manhattan.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.640
 So that was my first thought.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.560
 Can we pause there for a second?

05:00.560 --> 05:03.840
 So 6.30 a.m. you wake up, you leave,

05:03.840 --> 05:08.720
 and then the plane hits at 8.45 a.m.

05:08.720 --> 05:11.320
 It's just interesting how you phrase it.

05:11.320 --> 05:14.600
 So how did you hear that a plane hit something?

05:16.720 --> 05:20.320
 I'm a big news radio guy, news guy, bit of a buff.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.960
 I've been that way since I was a kid

05:21.960 --> 05:26.880
 and I had the news radio on the local New York radio station.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.960
 And as I was driving the truck,

05:28.960 --> 05:33.160
 I heard, you know, an emergency report.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.600
 This just in, aircraft has just struck

05:35.600 --> 05:37.200
 the World Trade Center.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.280
 And where Quinlan's is located,

05:39.280 --> 05:41.480
 it's on the north rim of Staten Island,

05:41.480 --> 05:43.360
 which is right on New York Harbor.

05:43.360 --> 05:46.840
 And you could see Statue of Liberty,

05:46.840 --> 05:48.960
 you know, a mile or two away in your distance.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.920
 And then past that is the towers.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.680
 So I just literally stopped the truck and looked out

05:54.680 --> 05:56.360
 and I saw the smoke.

05:56.360 --> 05:57.280
 So there was smoke?

05:57.280 --> 05:58.640
 Oh, it was dark, black smoke.

05:58.640 --> 05:59.800
 It was just, yeah, I mean,

05:59.800 --> 06:03.320
 it was burning fully at that point.

06:03.320 --> 06:06.080
 Did you have fear of what the hell happened?

06:06.080 --> 06:08.440
 Or is it? I was initially scared

06:08.440 --> 06:10.720
 for anybody involved.

06:10.720 --> 06:13.760
 I realized, I said, there's gonna be lots of fatalities,

06:13.760 --> 06:15.840
 obviously, depending on the size of the aircraft.

06:15.840 --> 06:19.760
 And, you know, the business day there

06:19.760 --> 06:21.680
 had started probably at 8, 8.30.

06:21.680 --> 06:24.280
 So those buildings should have been packed at that moment.

06:24.280 --> 06:26.720
 So that was a thought that crossed my mind.

06:27.800 --> 06:31.120
 But from our being responder perspective,

06:31.120 --> 06:35.920
 if you're off duty, normally you do not go to a scene

06:35.920 --> 06:37.080
 that they don't want you to

06:37.080 --> 06:38.920
 because of accountability and safety.

06:40.240 --> 06:42.320
 The on duty platoon will handle it.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.800
 And if it's something very horrific,

06:44.800 --> 06:46.640
 then they will have something called a recall,

06:46.640 --> 06:50.120
 which is any police firefighter or EMS personnel

06:50.120 --> 06:54.520
 is obligated to go to their command immediately,

06:54.520 --> 06:58.280
 check in with, you know, their command to get their gear

06:58.280 --> 07:01.400
 and stand by and await orders for deployment

07:01.400 --> 07:06.400
 or to remain in that command for routine duties.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.960
 How often throughout history have there been recalls?

07:09.960 --> 07:14.960
 I believe the one prior to that was like in the 1968 riots,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.160
 possibly, and then maybe in the 70s,

07:17.160 --> 07:19.320
 there was another blackout and riots.

07:19.320 --> 07:21.320
 And I remember my dad talking about it.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.320
 And he actually always said,

07:23.320 --> 07:26.080
 just remember if something bad's going down,

07:26.080 --> 07:29.920
 don't just rush in, you will wait the recall.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.000
 Or at the very least, if there isn't a recall,

07:32.000 --> 07:33.560
 you get to your firehouse.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.800
 And because if you show up somewhere,

07:37.800 --> 07:39.920
 there's a good chance that no one knows you're there.

07:39.920 --> 07:44.920
 And now you, in your well intended movements,

07:45.040 --> 07:48.520
 you get lost or trapped or no one's looking for you.

07:48.520 --> 07:51.240
 So that's the whole thing with, you know, checking in.

07:51.240 --> 07:55.160
 And now you're with a squad or, you know, group of guys

07:55.160 --> 07:57.160
 and everyone knows, you know,

07:57.160 --> 07:58.520
 hey, there's Nels, there's Lex.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.600
 Okay, they're on, you know, this team.

08:01.960 --> 08:05.560
 So I said, all right, they're not gonna need us.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.320
 It's probably gonna be a fifth alarm.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.360
 And you know, there'll be 250 firefighters there.

08:10.360 --> 08:11.200
 They'll handle it.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.020
 It's gonna be a bad day for those guys,

08:13.020 --> 08:16.280
 but you know, our guys take on some heavy stuff

08:16.280 --> 08:17.240
 and they'll be fine.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.800
 A few minutes later, the second plane hit

08:20.800 --> 08:25.560
 and I knew immediately, I'm like, okay, we're under attack.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.400
 So I just flew the truck back in.

08:27.400 --> 08:30.840
 I told my boss, I have to go.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.000
 He understood, he knew something was way wrong

08:33.000 --> 08:35.640
 and I just was flying.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.720
 At the time, I actually had a yellow Volkswagen Beetle,

08:38.720 --> 08:41.280
 kind of a goofy car to be driving, but I loved it.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.720
 So for people who are just listening,

08:42.720 --> 08:43.880
 you're kind of a big guy.

08:43.880 --> 08:47.200
 Well, yeah, I definitely need to lose about 50 pounds.

08:47.200 --> 08:50.360
 No, I don't mean in that way, your frame, big hands.

08:50.360 --> 08:53.080
 As my beloved friend, Bobby Adams would say to me,

08:54.040 --> 08:55.880
 I was driving around in a clown wagon

08:55.880 --> 08:59.480
 and he also says, I have a waving hairdo, waving bye bye.

08:59.480 --> 09:00.520
 So thanks, Bobby.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.400
 But yeah, he's a great friend.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.680
 Yeah, so I took the Volkswagen and I flew in

09:05.680 --> 09:07.640
 and I was heading over to Verrazano Bridge

09:07.640 --> 09:09.920
 and hit the Brooklyn Queens Expressway.

09:11.760 --> 09:15.720
 And my phone rang and my wife normally doesn't curse

09:15.720 --> 09:17.280
 or raise a voice and she was yelling at me.

09:17.280 --> 09:20.400
 And she said, don't go in there, go to your firehouse.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.440
 Well, first she asked, well, she knew I was on the way,

09:22.440 --> 09:24.280
 but she just wanted to know where.

09:24.280 --> 09:28.960
 And I said, I'm on the curve, which is 65th Street

09:28.960 --> 09:31.720
 on the Brooklyn Queens Expressway called Dead Man's Curve.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.440
 We actually used to do a lot of car wrecks up there.

09:35.360 --> 09:37.560
 And I was hitting that curve pretty fast.

09:37.560 --> 09:40.560
 And then right around the curve is the exit to the firehouse.

09:40.560 --> 09:43.200
 And I had to decide, well, am I driving right in

09:43.200 --> 09:45.040
 to the battery tunnel to the city

09:46.240 --> 09:47.600
 or am I going to the firehouse?

09:47.600 --> 09:49.400
 And then I said, but I have no gear.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.200
 I'm gonna be ineffective.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.080
 How do I show up with no gear, no protection, you know?

09:55.080 --> 09:59.760
 So she said, do what your dad would follow the recall,

09:59.760 --> 10:00.600
 go to the firehouse.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.000
 And I hung up the phone, said, I love you, gotta go.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.560
 And I did, I went to the firehouse

10:05.560 --> 10:07.600
 and I'm glad I listened to her.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.640
 I had my father ringing in my ears.

10:09.640 --> 10:13.080
 My dad, beautiful guy, he's 82.

10:13.080 --> 10:16.200
 He did 34 years in the New York City Fire Department.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.160
 He came down on end stage, non

10:19.160 --> 10:25.120
 and he's 38 back in, going on 39, 1978.

10:26.840 --> 10:31.600
 And this guy, he's my hero.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.960
 He was gonna die, they sent him home.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.160
 They said, there's really not much we can do.

10:37.160 --> 10:38.480
 Go get your affairs in order.

10:38.480 --> 10:41.480
 And he says, but doc, I have three young kids.

10:41.480 --> 10:45.120
 And she called him a couple hours later.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.560
 She said, I got in touch with Sloan Kettering

10:47.560 --> 11:16.840
 and they have a new drug.

11:16.840 --> 11:46.800
 So I'll take you to the hospital.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.820
 and do the same exact reverse route

11:48.820 --> 11:50.700
 and he'd get to the cancer center

11:51.820 --> 11:55.860
 and my mom would meet him and he'd get his infusion

11:55.860 --> 11:58.380
 and within two hours he'd be violently ill

11:58.380 --> 12:01.900
 for a few days, really badly ill.

12:02.780 --> 12:06.140
 And I just remember, yeah, I was 10 years old

12:06.140 --> 12:09.620
 and he just had to have the room darkened out

12:09.620 --> 12:11.900
 and he'd be so sick and I'd just go in

12:11.900 --> 12:14.720
 and wipe the vomit on his face,

12:14.720 --> 12:15.960
 just try to give him a little water

12:15.960 --> 12:18.620
 but he couldn't take it down because he'd throw it up.

12:19.860 --> 12:24.860
 And maybe on Saturday he'd start coming around a little bit,

12:25.680 --> 12:27.420
 drink down a little bit of tea

12:27.420 --> 12:29.540
 and on Sunday morning he'd put his robe on

12:29.540 --> 12:33.260
 and he'd go down, mom would make him black coffee and toast

12:33.260 --> 12:37.260
 and he'd sit up, watch the news, watch a game

12:37.260 --> 12:39.220
 and then Monday morning he'd go back to work.

12:39.220 --> 12:40.620
 He did that for four years.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.880
 And he's 82 and he's still here.

12:43.880 --> 12:44.720
 Yeah.

12:45.940 --> 12:48.580
 You said that your dad's a man of a few words

12:48.580 --> 12:50.940
 but when he talks, they're profound.

12:50.940 --> 12:54.100
 So what words were ringing in your ear

12:54.100 --> 12:54.940
 when you were driving?

12:54.940 --> 12:56.540
 I just always remember him saying,

12:56.540 --> 13:00.100
 kid, they give the recall, you go to the firehouse,

13:00.100 --> 13:02.420
 you don't go where you think you should,

13:02.420 --> 13:05.100
 you go to the firehouse, you follow your orders.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.100
 So do the smart thing, do your job.

13:07.100 --> 13:07.940
 Yes, sir.

13:07.940 --> 13:09.860
 And every time we'd hang up the phone,

13:09.860 --> 13:14.060
 it's fireman talk, he'd say, I love you, keep low.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.420
 My dad couldn't tell me he loved me

13:15.420 --> 13:19.340
 until I told him when I first got on a fire

13:19.340 --> 13:22.740
 upon when I was 22 and my dad grew up in a tough household.

13:22.740 --> 13:25.820
 My granddad was a good man, but a tormented man.

13:25.820 --> 13:29.040
 He was sent away from home at 12 years old.

13:30.340 --> 13:33.680
 He was from Denmark and I'm named after him, Grandpa Nils.

13:34.580 --> 13:39.100
 And I think his demons took up a large part of his life.

13:39.100 --> 13:42.540
 His anger, whatever it was, his fear.

13:42.540 --> 13:44.700
 We got the sense that maybe when he was a child,

13:44.700 --> 13:46.780
 he was an apprentice baker,

13:46.780 --> 13:49.940
 living with strangers, working for them.

13:49.940 --> 13:51.800
 And we think maybe he was abused

13:51.800 --> 13:54.140
 and that's why he took it out on my dad

13:54.140 --> 13:55.340
 and my grandma and my aunts.

13:55.340 --> 14:00.340
 But they made it up to each other

14:00.540 --> 14:01.900
 at the end of my granddad's life.

14:01.900 --> 14:04.660
 My granddad turned out to be the best grandfather ever.

14:04.660 --> 14:07.300
 I think he tried to heal and heal everyone

14:07.300 --> 14:08.740
 by his change of behavior.

14:08.740 --> 14:12.180
 So he's proof that you can change,

14:12.180 --> 14:14.280
 you can improve if you work on it.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.900
 But I know I'm going off track here, but.

14:16.900 --> 14:18.100
 But you were man enough in your,

14:18.100 --> 14:19.660
 you say in your 20s to tell your dad.

14:19.660 --> 14:20.500
 To my dad, yeah.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.680
 And my dad, I got on a job.

14:23.740 --> 14:25.220
 He said, how'd it go, kid?

14:25.220 --> 14:27.580
 That was the tour, we called it Tour of Duty.

14:27.580 --> 14:30.540
 I said, oh, dad, it was great, it was great, I love it.

14:30.540 --> 14:32.660
 And he goes, well, just remember, you keep low,

14:32.660 --> 14:34.220
 you always keep low.

14:34.220 --> 14:37.860
 And keep low means you stay down below the flames,

14:37.860 --> 14:40.540
 if a room flashes over and it's burning,

14:40.540 --> 14:42.700
 if you stay up high, you're gonna get burned badly.

14:42.700 --> 14:45.300
 But if you get down on your belly and you crawl,

14:45.300 --> 14:46.140
 you'll get out.

14:47.900 --> 14:49.980
 So he'd always say that when he'd hang up the phone.

14:49.980 --> 14:51.540
 And I said, well, I love you, pop.

14:51.540 --> 14:53.380
 And he says, well, thanks, kid.

14:53.380 --> 14:56.100
 I said, well, you can say it too.

14:57.300 --> 14:58.540
 Oh, nice, you pressured him.

14:58.540 --> 14:59.860
 And he did, and he said it.

14:59.860 --> 15:01.580
 And now every time we talk, he says it.

15:01.580 --> 15:06.060
 So, you know, they talk about masculinity and whatnot.

15:06.060 --> 15:09.140
 And my dad is one of those tough, tough guys

15:09.140 --> 15:10.340
 with a soft edge.

15:10.340 --> 15:14.380
 And that's how he brought me up, you know,

15:14.380 --> 15:15.740
 to be a protector.

15:15.740 --> 15:16.580
 I hate bullies.

15:16.580 --> 15:18.740
 I was bullied really badly as a kid,

15:18.740 --> 15:21.220
 and I really hated it.

15:21.220 --> 15:24.700
 And now I find myself sometimes throwing myself

15:24.700 --> 15:28.220
 into situations to protect people that are being,

15:28.220 --> 15:30.220
 you know, violated and hurt.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.820
 And I just can't walk away from it.

15:32.820 --> 15:33.780
 But that's my dad.

15:33.780 --> 15:36.500
 My dad was that, you know, just a great guy.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.340
 But anyway, yeah.

15:37.340 --> 15:39.300
 You still listen to, therefore, see,

15:39.300 --> 15:43.140
 you probably went to rush right to the towers,

15:43.140 --> 15:43.980
 but you went.

15:43.980 --> 15:46.300
 Yeah, so anyway, I got, I did, I listened to him.

15:46.300 --> 15:47.140
 I listened to my wife.

15:47.140 --> 15:49.020
 I went to the firehouse, and it was really strange.

15:49.020 --> 15:52.460
 It was eerie because the computer dispatch system

15:52.460 --> 15:56.580
 was still beeping, which meant it sent a dispatch,

15:56.580 --> 15:58.660
 and the truck received it.

15:58.660 --> 16:01.300
 Ladder 114, my truck company received it,

16:01.300 --> 16:03.180
 and they left, they were gone.

16:03.180 --> 16:06.740
 So it was this beautiful old building built in the 1880s

16:06.740 --> 16:11.700
 with a spiral staircase, just a narrow old brick garage,

16:11.700 --> 16:13.100
 and it was empty.

16:13.100 --> 16:15.460
 And I just heard the computer chirping.

16:15.460 --> 16:17.220
 And I looked down on a ticket, and it said,

16:17.220 --> 16:20.620
 Ladder 114, respond, the Vessian West World Trade Center

16:20.620 --> 16:23.220
 aircraft into building.

16:23.220 --> 16:26.100
 And I said, oh, God, I just hope they're not on a death ride

16:26.100 --> 16:31.740
 because this now was two towers, and they were burning.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.460
 They were free burning, and I knew

16:33.460 --> 16:35.780
 this was really, really bad.

16:35.780 --> 16:38.780
 And I got on the phone, and I called command right away.

16:38.780 --> 16:43.180
 I called the 40th Battalion, and Chief's aide just said, look,

16:43.180 --> 16:44.020
 get 12 guys.

16:44.020 --> 16:45.860
 Sign them in to the journal.

16:45.860 --> 16:48.340
 There's a journal of daily events.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.980
 Everything that takes place in the firehouse 24 seven

16:50.980 --> 16:53.540
 has to be logged.

16:53.540 --> 16:57.820
 And I logged myself as coming in, reporting for duty.

16:57.820 --> 17:00.060
 And as the guys came in, I logged them in.

17:00.060 --> 17:03.780
 And then one of our lieutenants took command.

17:03.780 --> 17:05.900
 We grabbed up a bunch of gear, and they basically

17:05.900 --> 17:09.380
 told us, get 12 guys, get a city bus,

17:09.380 --> 17:13.700
 and get down to the battery tunnel they said

17:13.700 --> 17:15.260
 would probably be closed.

17:15.260 --> 17:17.660
 There was threats it was going to be blown up

17:17.660 --> 17:20.340
 to get to the Brooklyn Bridge.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.820
 And so we did.

17:22.820 --> 17:23.900
 We got a city bus.

17:23.900 --> 17:26.300
 We flagged it down, and the bus driver said, I'm sorry.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.380
 I can't give you the bus.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.340
 I will drive you.

17:28.340 --> 17:30.900
 And he took us, and we stopped at Engine 201,

17:30.900 --> 17:35.620
 which is just about a quarter mile down the road from us.

17:35.620 --> 17:37.740
 That's our affiliated engine company,

17:37.740 --> 17:44.580
 and my childhood best friend here, Johnny Schardt,

17:44.580 --> 17:46.460
 he was assigned there, and he was on shift.

17:46.460 --> 17:51.300
 And then they went through the tunnel.

17:51.300 --> 17:55.500
 And we picked up those guys, the off duty guys from 201,

17:55.500 --> 17:57.300
 and then we kept going down Fourth Avenue,

17:57.300 --> 18:00.220
 and we picked up 239's crew.

18:00.220 --> 18:01.860
 And then we hightailed it down the bridge,

18:01.860 --> 18:04.020
 and there was a lot of traffic.

18:04.020 --> 18:05.900
 There was a lot of people fleeing,

18:05.900 --> 18:11.340
 coming over the bridge in waves, so it affected the inbound.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.220
 What was the mood like among the crew?

18:14.220 --> 18:17.460
 It was somber, because just prior to getting on the bus,

18:17.460 --> 18:20.180
 the first tower went down.

18:20.180 --> 18:27.100
 So we figured that I heard 114, my lieutenant, Dennis Oberg,

18:27.100 --> 18:28.020
 heard him on the radio.

18:28.020 --> 18:34.380
 And he said, 114, Manhattan, we're on your frequency.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.260
 What do you need us?

18:35.260 --> 18:38.380
 And they said, Tally Ho, which is our nickname.

18:38.380 --> 18:42.140
 Tally Ho, respond to the Vessian West to the command post

18:42.140 --> 18:44.260
 and receive your orders.

18:44.260 --> 18:47.460
 And I heard Dennis say, Tally Ho, 10 4.

18:47.460 --> 18:52.660
 And Dennis, a little while after that,

18:52.660 --> 18:57.060
 they were proceeding to go into, I believe it was,

18:57.060 --> 18:58.460
 I get this mixed up, and I'm sorry.

18:58.460 --> 19:00.260
 I should know this by the back of my hand,

19:00.260 --> 19:02.340
 but sometimes it's just such a haze.

19:02.340 --> 19:06.620
 But the second tower hit was the first one to go down.

19:06.620 --> 19:08.900
 And they were heading over to go in it.

19:08.900 --> 19:10.540
 And all of a sudden, he looked up,

19:10.540 --> 19:12.900
 and he saw what he thought to be disintegration.

19:12.900 --> 19:14.420
 And he turned the guys around.

19:14.420 --> 19:15.020
 He said, run.

19:15.020 --> 19:15.540
 Just run.

19:15.540 --> 19:16.260
 Don't look back.

19:16.260 --> 19:16.900
 Don't look up.

19:16.900 --> 19:18.180
 Go.

19:18.180 --> 19:20.340
 They sprinted as fast as they could.

19:20.340 --> 19:23.620
 And they dove under a fire truck.

19:23.620 --> 19:26.340
 And the guys that were sprinting behind him 40 feet away

19:26.340 --> 19:29.860
 were underneath a pile that was 10 stories deep.

19:29.860 --> 19:31.940
 They were killed.

19:31.940 --> 19:37.020
 And just further into that pile was his rookie son, Dennis's

19:37.020 --> 19:39.660
 rookie son, who was working in Ladder 105, which

19:39.660 --> 19:42.140
 was my first command under the department.

19:42.140 --> 19:45.940
 I worked for it, proudly served for three years.

19:45.940 --> 19:49.060
 And just aside them was my childhood best friend,

19:49.060 --> 19:53.300
 John Chard, and his crew from 201.

19:53.300 --> 19:59.260
 And they were all killed.

19:59.260 --> 20:05.820
 And a strange irony to that is that Dennis's son, Dennis Jr.,

20:05.820 --> 20:10.340
 was working underneath, under the wing of a senior man,

20:10.340 --> 20:10.940
 as we say.

20:10.940 --> 20:13.020
 A senior man is a guy with a lot of experience.

20:13.020 --> 20:18.140
 And he'll watch over you, make sure you don't veer off,

20:18.140 --> 20:19.740
 like I veer off a lot in talking.

20:19.740 --> 20:24.020
 And you don't veer off, and you get yourself hurt.

20:24.020 --> 20:28.340
 In the morning of 1993 bombing, Henry Miller was my senior man.

20:35.700 --> 20:38.620
 And I was the young guy under his wing.

20:38.620 --> 20:41.180
 And he protected me.

20:41.180 --> 20:43.100
 And toward the end of the day, he looked around.

20:43.100 --> 20:46.220
 He said, kid, it's a bad day.

20:46.220 --> 20:48.860
 He said, they didn't do it right.

20:48.860 --> 20:51.140
 They blew it up in the middle.

20:51.140 --> 20:53.700
 If they did it in a corner, they would

20:53.700 --> 20:57.420
 have dropped this building half a mile down at Canal Street.

20:57.420 --> 20:58.500
 But don't kid yourself.

20:58.500 --> 20:59.920
 They'll be back, and they'll do it.

20:59.920 --> 21:02.340
 And they'll do it right next time.

21:02.340 --> 21:03.980
 And it's so strange and so prophetic,

21:03.980 --> 21:06.740
 because he was there with them.

21:06.740 --> 21:07.900
 He died with Dennis.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.500
 He knew it.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.860
 And like 1994, we had a training manual

21:11.860 --> 21:14.980
 with a picture of the towers with a target.

21:14.980 --> 21:18.780
 And this is not a matter of if, but a matter

21:18.780 --> 21:22.060
 of when, be prepared.

21:22.060 --> 21:22.900
 And it's haunting.

21:22.900 --> 21:25.100
 It was like people knew, right?

21:25.100 --> 21:27.580
 And we didn't stop it.

21:27.580 --> 21:33.060
 And so we got off the bus, but just prior to that,

21:33.060 --> 21:36.540
 coming over the bridge of the second tower, it's gone now.

21:36.540 --> 21:38.340
 And we're just destroyed, because we're like,

21:38.340 --> 21:39.060
 our guys are there.

21:39.060 --> 21:39.980
 They're all in there.

21:39.980 --> 21:43.860
 Now we're feeling like cowards, because we got there late.

21:43.860 --> 21:45.940
 And initially, we're thinking there's

21:45.940 --> 21:49.540
 500 guys that are gone, because there was a tent alarm

21:49.540 --> 21:56.980
 assignment, which means 50, 60 fire trucks, five to six guys

21:56.980 --> 22:00.060
 per, you know, you're looking at.

22:00.060 --> 22:02.420
 At least there was even more tent alarm,

22:02.420 --> 22:04.780
 plus multiple alarms on top of it.

22:04.780 --> 22:07.180
 There was a dispatch, basically equivalent of five

22:07.180 --> 22:10.260
 to 600 firefighters.

22:10.260 --> 22:12.780
 We figured, oh, they're all in there, all gone.

22:12.780 --> 22:15.220
 All the police officers, Port Authority police,

22:15.220 --> 22:18.820
 NYPD police, court officers just up the street

22:18.820 --> 22:23.940
 from the courts, transit cops from the train tunnels.

22:23.940 --> 22:26.420
 Like, just, you know, we knew everybody was going there,

22:26.420 --> 22:28.540
 and now they're gone.

22:28.540 --> 22:31.180
 So what you saw, what were we looking at?

22:31.180 --> 22:32.820
 What did it look like?

22:32.820 --> 22:37.260
 So you saw rubble, and then you knew that many, that 105

22:37.260 --> 22:41.300
 and 201, many of those guys are in the, they're dead.

22:41.300 --> 22:43.500
 Yeah, and we thought 114 was in there, too.

22:43.500 --> 22:44.860
 We didn't realize at that point.

22:44.860 --> 22:47.540
 We didn't even realize that they had gotten under that truck.

22:47.540 --> 22:48.700
 We thought they were all gone.

22:48.700 --> 22:53.340
 But yeah, it looked like, it looked like a movie scene

22:53.340 --> 22:56.140
 with just end of the earth destruction.

22:56.140 --> 23:01.140
 It's just massive piles of intertwined steel,

23:01.140 --> 23:02.540
 what was left of the steel.

23:02.540 --> 23:05.020
 And you know, there was no cement.

23:05.020 --> 23:06.340
 It was all just dust.

23:06.340 --> 23:12.300
 And it was just a burning pile of dust and concrete

23:12.300 --> 23:13.420
 and plastic.

23:13.420 --> 23:15.700
 And it was just, everything was just pulverized.

23:15.700 --> 23:20.700
 And it was truly hard to mentally compute that.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.420
 Like, it was like, what?

23:22.420 --> 23:25.900
 And then there was just fighter jets, a couple of fighter jets

23:25.900 --> 23:26.980
 just circling.

23:26.980 --> 23:31.220
 And you just heard them flying by over your head.

23:31.220 --> 23:32.940
 I mean, you'd literally see the guy banking

23:32.940 --> 23:35.300
 a turn around a Brooklyn bridge and just coming back.

23:35.300 --> 23:38.660
 And I'm like, holy shoot, we're under attack?

23:38.660 --> 23:41.820
 And we couldn't really get concrete intel

23:41.820 --> 23:43.860
 as to what exactly we knew planes.

23:43.860 --> 23:47.300
 But then we kept hearing there was multiple devices.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.620
 There was devices in a battery tunnel.

23:49.620 --> 23:51.860
 And there was devices on a George Washington bridge

23:51.860 --> 23:52.940
 and in the subways.

23:52.940 --> 23:54.820
 And it was just chaos.

23:54.820 --> 23:56.780
 It was, I mean, we kept it together, obviously,

23:56.780 --> 23:58.340
 because that's kind of, we try.

23:58.340 --> 23:59.700
 That's what we do.

23:59.700 --> 24:03.900
 But the just constant barrage of different reports,

24:03.900 --> 24:06.020
 it was like, holy shoot.

24:06.020 --> 24:07.940
 And then as we were being deployed,

24:07.940 --> 24:09.180
 it was a little frustrating.

24:09.180 --> 24:11.220
 But they were trying to take command and send us

24:11.220 --> 24:13.460
 in groups now because they realized

24:13.460 --> 24:15.900
 we have to start searching this.

24:15.900 --> 24:20.220
 You could hear the alarms on the Scott Air Mask, the packs

24:20.220 --> 24:22.180
 we wear to go into the building.

24:22.180 --> 24:23.340
 It has a motion alarm.

24:23.340 --> 24:25.220
 And if you stop moving for 30 seconds,

24:25.220 --> 24:29.780
 it just sounds like this whining, just screaming bell.

24:29.780 --> 24:32.780
 And it just keeps going and going.

24:32.780 --> 24:35.580
 And you could hear multiple units of those going off.

24:35.580 --> 24:37.620
 And you're like, wait a minute.

24:37.620 --> 24:38.900
 There's guys with those.

24:38.900 --> 24:40.300
 Where are they?

24:40.300 --> 24:42.460
 And it's emanating from underneath the pile.

24:42.460 --> 24:51.460
 And it was just surreal and truly like a war zone.

24:51.460 --> 24:53.780
 I mean, I was a soldier in the reserves.

24:53.780 --> 24:55.020
 And I never saw combat.

24:55.020 --> 24:56.420
 And I would never claim that I did.

24:56.420 --> 24:58.340
 But we trained.

24:58.340 --> 25:00.020
 We trained for a lot of situations.

25:00.020 --> 25:03.580
 And we trained in real life atmospheres and whatnot.

25:03.580 --> 25:06.420
 And this was just beyond that by leaps and bounds.

25:06.420 --> 25:08.260
 It was bizarre.

25:08.260 --> 25:10.220
 Did you see the towers collapse?

25:10.220 --> 25:11.740
 As we were coming over the bridge,

25:11.740 --> 25:15.660
 the first one, as we were deploying from the firehouse,

25:15.660 --> 25:16.660
 we had a television on.

25:16.660 --> 25:17.660
 And I saw it go down.

25:21.540 --> 25:24.500
 And we were so involved in getting gear together

25:24.500 --> 25:27.020
 and getting teams set up and, OK, you're

25:27.020 --> 25:29.700
 going to be with these two guys.

25:29.700 --> 25:31.380
 And I just yelled, there's the guys.

25:31.380 --> 25:32.500
 And they're looking at me.

25:32.500 --> 25:33.580
 I dropped to my knees.

25:33.580 --> 25:34.540
 And I started praying.

25:34.540 --> 25:36.020
 They're like, what the hell's wrong?

25:36.020 --> 25:37.740
 I said, I couldn't even say.

25:37.740 --> 25:40.500
 I was like, 114, they're in there.

25:40.500 --> 25:41.500
 And they're like, what?

25:41.500 --> 25:43.660
 I said, the tower's gone.

25:43.660 --> 25:46.380
 And all you saw on the TV was just this pile of dust.

25:46.380 --> 25:49.580
 And I guess because they didn't see it going down,

25:49.580 --> 25:51.700
 they probably thought I truly lost it.

25:51.700 --> 25:55.180
 And then the realization came.

25:55.180 --> 25:57.620
 It was like, wow, the tower's down.

25:57.620 --> 26:00.060
 So now it was like, wow, this is really on.

26:00.060 --> 26:02.820
 So we just took off and got that boss.

26:02.820 --> 26:10.980
 And so if you thought many of the guys on 114 were dead,

26:10.980 --> 26:14.300
 if you thought that, did you think you were going to die?

26:14.300 --> 26:19.180
 I mean, if you're rushing towards the rubble?

26:19.180 --> 26:22.660
 As crazy as it sounds, I never thought that the other tower

26:22.660 --> 26:23.500
 would go down.

26:23.500 --> 26:27.260
 I said, OK, maybe some freak chance that one went down.

26:27.260 --> 26:29.020
 But no, the other one's not going to go.

26:29.020 --> 26:30.820
 They're built so strong.

26:30.820 --> 26:32.580
 I was in those towers so many times.

26:32.580 --> 26:35.140
 I mean, I ate dinner up in the top floor restaurant windows

26:35.140 --> 26:35.780
 on the world.

26:35.780 --> 26:38.500
 And I'm saying, nah, there's no way.

26:38.500 --> 26:41.220
 Like, how the hell did this one happen?

26:41.220 --> 26:45.180
 But I was having a hard time mentally processing

26:45.180 --> 26:46.660
 that the building was gone.

26:46.660 --> 26:51.540
 And believe me, if you don't have fear in this industry

26:51.540 --> 26:55.860
 and police, fire, military, then you're kidding yourself

26:55.860 --> 26:57.780
 or you're a danger to everyone.

26:57.780 --> 27:00.220
 I don't care who it is, as tough as they are, this and that.

27:00.220 --> 27:02.300
 Everybody has a certain level of fear

27:02.300 --> 27:03.460
 with doing this.

27:03.460 --> 27:06.020
 And I don't care how long you do it,

27:06.020 --> 27:08.460
 there's always that chance of something going bad.

27:08.460 --> 27:12.820
 And everyone who does it has that certain amount of fear.

27:12.820 --> 27:16.340
 But at that point, it was such a feeling of disbelief

27:16.340 --> 27:18.180
 that fear wasn't even kicking in.

27:18.180 --> 27:20.700
 It was just like, what the hell just happened?

27:20.700 --> 27:24.180
 And I honestly think it was almost like a shock.

27:24.180 --> 27:27.300
 And it just stayed that whole day.

27:27.300 --> 27:30.580
 So the building is, before it collapses, is burning.

27:30.580 --> 27:31.300
 It's just burning.

27:31.300 --> 27:35.180
 I mean, upper floors, up in the 78th, up to the 80s.

27:35.180 --> 27:39.180
 And then the way that the cut was from the plane,

27:39.180 --> 27:40.580
 it wasn't just straight across.

27:40.580 --> 27:43.820
 It was from the 78th, then on up to maybe the 86th.

27:43.820 --> 27:49.700
 And then the jet fuel had come down and was burning down.

27:49.700 --> 27:51.940
 And there was people on the ground

27:51.940 --> 27:56.500
 who were doused with jet fuel that was already burning.

27:56.500 --> 27:59.020
 And they were lit on fire on the ground.

27:59.020 --> 28:04.060
 It was just insane how vast the destruction path was.

28:04.060 --> 28:06.860
 As a firefighter, what are you supposed

28:06.860 --> 28:11.300
 to do with that scale of fire?

28:11.300 --> 28:14.820
 I think the first bosses in, the first chiefs,

28:14.820 --> 28:18.500
 were just going to do their best to get,

28:18.500 --> 28:22.420
 as we get hose lines, what our whole theory is,

28:22.420 --> 28:25.380
 or our tactics is, to get water at the fire,

28:25.380 --> 28:28.700
 at the base of the fire, and get the truck company,

28:28.700 --> 28:30.180
 which is the ladder company.

28:30.180 --> 28:32.580
 They're the guys who break the doors down, put ladders up,

28:32.580 --> 28:35.860
 this and that, to get them to where the life is most

28:35.860 --> 28:38.380
 expected and get them out of there.

28:38.380 --> 28:40.580
 So I think the chiefs tactics at that point

28:40.580 --> 28:42.620
 was, let me get multiple engine companies.

28:42.620 --> 28:45.180
 Let me get four, five, six hose lines

28:45.180 --> 28:47.820
 fighting this fire, this massive fire.

28:47.820 --> 28:51.460
 And let me get 15, 20 truck companies up there just

28:51.460 --> 28:52.820
 yoking people out of there.

28:52.820 --> 28:54.460
 Yeah, but you got to go up the stair.

28:54.460 --> 28:55.860
 Everything's not working.

28:55.860 --> 29:00.580
 Yeah, guys had to walk up 80, 80, 90, 100 flights of stairs.

29:00.580 --> 29:05.580
 And there's audio of officers and firefighters

29:06.340 --> 29:08.180
 speaking to each other on the radio channels.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.780
 And unfortunately, at that point in time,

29:09.780 --> 29:12.580
 we had very, very bad communication system.

29:12.580 --> 29:14.700
 We'd been fighting for years to get radios

29:14.700 --> 29:15.660
 that work properly.

29:15.660 --> 29:18.460
 We couldn't because it was a lot of money.

29:18.460 --> 29:21.300
 We fought for years to get the full bunker firefighting

29:21.300 --> 29:23.700
 suits, which is the pants and the coat.

29:23.700 --> 29:26.620
 We used to have just coats and these roll up rubber boots

29:26.620 --> 29:29.700
 and guys were burning to death and we had to fight.

29:29.700 --> 29:31.780
 And unfortunately we lost three guys

29:31.780 --> 29:35.580
 in one vicious, vicious fire in 1994.

29:35.580 --> 29:38.340
 And then they finally said, enough's enough.

29:38.340 --> 29:40.380
 Give these guys the gear.

29:40.380 --> 29:45.380
 So it's a strange phenomenon in the first responder world

29:45.740 --> 29:47.780
 and in the military world.

29:47.780 --> 29:49.820
 It's really one of the most important things

29:49.820 --> 29:51.740
 that takes place in society.

29:51.740 --> 29:54.660
 The most pertinent organizations.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.660
 And we can't get the funding we need.

29:56.660 --> 29:57.540
 It's crazy.

29:57.540 --> 30:00.740
 They'll throw money at every nonsensical thing.

30:00.740 --> 30:03.620
 But when it comes to gear, equipment,

30:03.620 --> 30:08.220
 protective equipment, trucks, this couldn't get it.

30:08.220 --> 30:10.140
 Just all the ways you could take care of people.

30:10.140 --> 30:14.180
 I saw since 9 11, the wars in the Middle East

30:14.180 --> 30:17.380
 have cost America over six trillion dollars.

30:17.380 --> 30:20.660
 And the amount of that money that was spent

30:20.660 --> 30:24.860
 on the soldiers, in this case the first responders,

30:24.860 --> 30:25.860
 is minimal.

30:25.860 --> 30:26.820
 Compared to it, yeah.

30:26.820 --> 30:27.660
 Almost nothing.

30:27.660 --> 30:30.860
 They, Lex, they closed down.

30:30.860 --> 30:33.340
 I believe it's either seven or eight.

30:33.340 --> 30:38.340
 In May of 2002, they closed down nine firehouses

30:40.340 --> 30:42.740
 in New York City for budget reasons.

30:42.740 --> 30:44.320
 We hadn't even finished cleaning up

30:44.320 --> 30:48.260
 the World Trade Center site and they slashed the budget.

30:48.260 --> 30:52.620
 And still to this day, have not reopened those firehouses.

30:52.620 --> 30:55.100
 There's a million more people now living in New York City

30:55.100 --> 30:57.500
 than there were in 2001.

30:57.500 --> 31:00.780
 And the fire protection is way less than it was.

31:00.780 --> 31:02.580
 And it's a sin.

31:02.580 --> 31:03.700
 It's really a sin.

31:03.700 --> 31:06.160
 Can I ask you a difficult question?

31:07.180 --> 31:12.180
 So there's this famous photograph of a falling man.

31:13.460 --> 31:17.560
 So many people had to decide when they're above the fire,

31:17.560 --> 31:19.860
 in the fire, whether to jump out of the building

31:19.860 --> 31:21.880
 or to burn to death.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.740
 What do you make of that decision?

31:23.740 --> 31:25.940
 What do you make of that situation?

31:25.940 --> 31:28.500
 Those people who jumped,

31:28.500 --> 31:31.420
 those were acts of sheer desperation.

31:31.420 --> 31:36.100
 I've been in fires and just minor burns,

31:36.100 --> 31:37.660
 but minor in situation.

31:37.660 --> 31:39.940
 But I've been trapped, caught somewhat.

31:39.940 --> 31:43.300
 Ended up in a burn center for nothing serious at all.

31:43.300 --> 31:48.300
 But for those brief seconds, half a minute was,

31:49.100 --> 31:51.300
 thank God, if I didn't have my fire gear on,

31:51.300 --> 31:54.700
 I would have been burned to a very, very horrible level.

31:54.700 --> 31:57.900
 Those people were burning alive.

31:58.840 --> 32:01.500
 And they had the choice of either to stay there

32:01.500 --> 32:05.900
 and burn alive or to launch themselves.

32:05.900 --> 32:09.560
 And some of them, I don't fault them,

32:09.560 --> 32:12.500
 but they had a few folks, they won't show it anymore

32:12.500 --> 32:15.580
 because they say, I don't know why it offends some people,

32:15.580 --> 32:18.980
 but they had a couple folks that took umbrellas

32:18.980 --> 32:20.740
 and they took garbage bags

32:20.740 --> 32:22.420
 because they thought that it would slow down

32:22.420 --> 32:24.740
 their acceleration rate to the ground

32:24.740 --> 32:27.900
 and maybe, just maybe they wouldn't be killed.

32:27.900 --> 32:32.220
 And that's, to me, a true sense of desperation for humanity

32:32.220 --> 32:34.840
 to say, I'm going to die either way,

32:34.840 --> 32:36.900
 but let me take my chance.

32:36.900 --> 32:39.860
 And I don't know the exact number of those folks

32:39.860 --> 32:43.100
 who did that, but our first member of the fire department

32:43.100 --> 32:47.080
 killed firefighter Daniel Serf, aged 216,

32:47.080 --> 32:49.380
 was struck by a jumper.

32:49.380 --> 32:54.380
 And one of my dear friends was ordered to help take him

32:54.980 --> 32:56.640
 and they knew he was passed away

32:56.640 --> 33:00.040
 because he was hit by a flying missile.

33:00.040 --> 33:03.280
 I mean, 120 miles an hour, a body lands on you.

33:03.280 --> 33:05.400
 Those two bodies are now crushed.

33:06.280 --> 33:08.560
 And they were ordered to take that firefighter

33:08.560 --> 33:11.700
 and bring him across the street to Engine 10, Ladder 10.

33:11.700 --> 33:16.380
 It was literally a firehouse, less than 100 yards

33:16.380 --> 33:18.180
 from the facade of the Trade Center,

33:18.180 --> 33:19.940
 from the Trade Center complex.

33:19.940 --> 33:22.300
 They were literally right there.

33:22.300 --> 33:25.220
 And there was plane parts that went into that firehouse,

33:25.220 --> 33:27.500
 landed into the front doors onto the roof,

33:27.500 --> 33:30.140
 but the building itself was not destroyed.

33:30.140 --> 33:33.980
 So it was used as a mini command center for quite a while.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.420
 So my friend was ordered to take Daniel's body

33:37.420 --> 33:42.420
 in respect and bring it over to this firehouse

33:43.640 --> 33:45.320
 and give it some semblance of dignity

33:45.320 --> 33:47.500
 and lay it out on one of the bunk rooms,

33:47.500 --> 33:49.360
 the bunks we have in the bunkhouse,

33:50.440 --> 33:53.560
 and just cover it with a sheet and put a sign,

33:53.560 --> 33:56.040
 please firefighter killed, do not disturb,

33:56.040 --> 33:57.460
 and then we'll get to him later

33:57.460 --> 34:01.040
 because obviously this operation is gonna go on for days.

34:01.040 --> 34:03.320
 And my friend, who's such a great, wonderful guy,

34:03.320 --> 34:06.960
 is so still to this day, filled with guilt

34:06.960 --> 34:09.720
 because if they weren't taking his body out

34:10.720 --> 34:12.400
 with the respect and dignity that they did,

34:12.400 --> 34:16.240
 it took a while because it's a tough situation.

34:17.320 --> 34:20.680
 His ladder company was coming over the bridge.

34:20.680 --> 34:23.560
 There's a famous picture of Ladder 118.

34:23.560 --> 34:26.080
 You see this tractor trailer fire truck.

34:26.080 --> 34:29.360
 It's the one when the guy in the back also drives.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.360
 And it's a zoomed out shot, and you see the Brooklyn Bridge,

34:32.360 --> 34:35.000
 and you see only the fire truck in the middle,

34:35.000 --> 34:38.240
 and you see the two burning towers in the distance.

34:38.240 --> 34:41.040
 Well, his engine company was just ahead of them

34:41.040 --> 34:44.840
 on the bridge, and the only reason that engine company lived

34:44.840 --> 34:46.480
 is their initial duty assignment

34:46.480 --> 34:49.600
 was to take that firefighter and bring his body over.

34:49.600 --> 34:50.440
 It's like the military.

34:50.440 --> 34:51.840
 We don't leave anyone behind.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.260
 These are our guys.

34:53.260 --> 34:56.160
 As some guys say, it's all about the guy right next to you,

34:56.160 --> 34:58.200
 and nothing else really matters.

34:58.200 --> 35:01.080
 When that guy right next to you goes down, it stops.

35:01.080 --> 35:03.000
 You get that guy to safety,

35:03.000 --> 35:05.640
 or if he's dead, you get him out.

35:05.640 --> 35:10.080
 So in that time frame, that saved his life.

35:10.080 --> 35:11.680
 But that's a heavy burden to carry now

35:11.680 --> 35:12.880
 for the rest of your life,

35:12.880 --> 35:15.280
 because you say, if I wasn't helping my dead friend,

35:15.280 --> 35:16.360
 I'm dead.

35:16.360 --> 35:17.200
 Yeah.

35:18.480 --> 35:21.280
 What did it look like at Ground Zero?

35:21.280 --> 35:22.580
 What did it feel like?

35:22.580 --> 35:24.240
 What did it smell like?

35:24.240 --> 35:27.160
 What, you said there was a sense

35:27.160 --> 35:29.240
 that it was almost like a war zone,

35:29.240 --> 35:33.760
 but can you paint a picture of how much dust is in the air?

35:33.760 --> 35:35.240
 How hot is it?

35:35.240 --> 35:36.900
 How many people are there?

35:37.760 --> 35:40.460
 And again, how did it feel like?

35:40.460 --> 35:45.160
 It was just, it was a scene of controlled chaos,

35:45.160 --> 35:47.720
 controlled because there was a semblance of command,

35:47.720 --> 35:50.120
 and we were just trying to do our jobs.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.160
 But it was such a frantic pace

35:53.160 --> 35:55.440
 because we're now digging frantically,

35:55.440 --> 35:58.280
 knowing that there's life underneath this pile.

35:58.280 --> 36:00.000
 And this is throughout the afternoon

36:00.000 --> 36:01.520
 of that day, the evening.

36:01.520 --> 36:03.360
 Yeah, I mean, this was nonstop,

36:04.600 --> 36:06.980
 just nonstop, really, for days.

36:06.980 --> 36:10.720
 But for my particular crew, we literally kept going.

36:10.720 --> 36:14.080
 We initially were dispatched over towards number seven,

36:14.080 --> 36:15.720
 had just gone down,

36:15.720 --> 36:17.920
 and we were searching the post office that was there.

36:17.920 --> 36:20.440
 There was reports of people trapped.

36:20.440 --> 36:22.880
 And we painstakingly searched every single inch

36:22.880 --> 36:25.480
 of that building to make sure no one was left in there.

36:25.480 --> 36:28.160
 And then we were deployed to the pile,

36:28.160 --> 36:30.160
 and the pile is sort of ambiguous

36:30.160 --> 36:32.860
 because it was just such a vast, vast pile.

36:32.860 --> 36:35.480
 I mean, it went for city blocks.

36:35.480 --> 36:38.700
 And we were assisting in the retrieval

36:38.700 --> 36:42.120
 of two Port Authority police officers.

36:42.120 --> 36:45.000
 We're lucky enough to survive, but they were trapped.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.860
 They were deep down into a crevasse,

36:46.860 --> 36:50.400
 and they had to be physically dug out and extricated.

36:50.400 --> 36:53.500
 So there was a couple hundred, few hundred guys involved

36:53.500 --> 36:56.100
 in that process of bringing in equipment,

36:56.100 --> 36:59.360
 jaws of life, airbags to lift steel,

36:59.360 --> 37:00.640
 to cut pieces of steel.

37:00.640 --> 37:03.240
 It was just a huge operation.

37:03.240 --> 37:05.840
 And we were back toward the logistics end of it,

37:05.840 --> 37:09.360
 shuttling in gear and bringing in stretchers,

37:09.360 --> 37:11.760
 bringing in oxygen, whatever was needed.

37:11.760 --> 37:13.980
 And you were trying to climb over

37:13.980 --> 37:16.620
 this jagged pile of debris.

37:16.620 --> 37:18.680
 It wasn't like you just walked 100 feet

37:18.680 --> 37:20.200
 on a street with something.

37:20.200 --> 37:22.800
 You were trying to climb over this I beam

37:22.800 --> 37:25.280
 and then down into this hole and then back up that hole.

37:25.280 --> 37:27.460
 I mean, just to run one piece of equipment

37:27.460 --> 37:32.200
 took a half an hour to get 100 feet, 200 feet.

37:32.200 --> 37:34.000
 You know, mind you, some of these pieces of equipment

37:34.000 --> 37:36.760
 are 100 pounds, you know, generator for hearse tools,

37:36.760 --> 37:39.960
 this massive motor on a frame.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.080
 Unstable ground.

37:41.080 --> 37:44.000
 Unstable ground, just horrible conditions.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.240
 Fires were still burning aside you, beneath you.

37:47.240 --> 37:51.000
 And at one point, I kind of veered off to the side

37:51.000 --> 37:52.520
 and I was with this other fireman

37:52.520 --> 37:55.360
 from my father's old ladder company, 172.

37:55.360 --> 38:00.360
 And it was strange because we were quite a bit down,

38:00.480 --> 38:03.580
 like 70 feet down into this ravine of debris.

38:04.440 --> 38:06.880
 And he says, brother, what do you hear?

38:06.880 --> 38:08.400
 And at the time it was like dust,

38:08.400 --> 38:11.800
 it was like sand just falling down a pile

38:11.800 --> 38:15.040
 and it was hissing from gas pipes and water pipes.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.840
 And I said, I hear the gas lines,

38:17.840 --> 38:20.360
 I hear the sand, I hear the concrete.

38:20.360 --> 38:22.640
 He goes, no, no, what else do you hear?

38:23.640 --> 38:26.560
 And just the side of us was a lady's pocketbook

38:26.560 --> 38:29.520
 and a high heel shoe and someone's sneaker

38:31.000 --> 38:32.060
 with nobody with it.

38:33.820 --> 38:37.040
 And I said, I don't know, I don't hear anything.

38:37.040 --> 38:37.960
 He says, me neither.

38:37.960 --> 38:41.120
 He goes, no one's coming out of here.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.320
 And I said, no, no, no,

38:42.320 --> 38:44.040
 there's gotta be someone coming out of here.

38:44.040 --> 38:45.680
 I mean, there's just thousands of people in here

38:45.680 --> 38:47.480
 and they're coming out.

38:47.480 --> 38:51.040
 He says, brother, we would hear them calling for help,

38:51.040 --> 38:51.880
 they're gone.

38:52.760 --> 38:55.880
 And I still at that point thought there was a chance.

38:55.880 --> 38:59.400
 And after about the fourth day,

38:59.400 --> 39:02.040
 they just said, this is a recovery now.

39:02.040 --> 39:05.240
 There's no more life, there's no more chance.

39:05.240 --> 39:07.320
 And then that first night we went full tilt

39:07.320 --> 39:11.080
 till my crew, my specific crew of 12, 15 guys.

39:11.080 --> 39:14.080
 And four in the morning, we just couldn't breathe anymore.

39:14.080 --> 39:16.680
 We couldn't see, we were caked just with,

39:16.680 --> 39:18.200
 it was like if you took flour

39:18.200 --> 39:20.680
 and just kept dousing yourself.

39:20.680 --> 39:22.560
 And the Lieutenant just said, look, guys,

39:22.560 --> 39:25.120
 we're gonna go back, we're gonna get some medical aid

39:25.120 --> 39:27.520
 and then we'll come back in a few hours.

39:27.520 --> 39:32.520
 And we took a city bus back through the battery tunnel

39:33.800 --> 39:37.060
 and unbeknownst to us that morning,

39:37.960 --> 39:39.320
 this off duty firefighter,

39:39.320 --> 39:41.560
 Steven Siller from Squad Company One,

39:42.500 --> 39:44.920
 he raced down there with his pickup

39:44.920 --> 39:47.560
 and he couldn't go any further

39:47.560 --> 39:49.080
 because the traffic was stopped up

39:49.080 --> 39:51.520
 because they had a report of a bomb.

39:51.520 --> 39:55.920
 So everything was held up and he grabbed his fire gear

39:55.920 --> 39:59.600
 and he put it on, stuff weighs about 60 pounds.

39:59.600 --> 40:01.100
 And he ran through the tunnel.

40:02.320 --> 40:05.600
 Two and a half miles, got to the end of the tunnel,

40:05.600 --> 40:08.160
 fire truck was coming in from the other way.

40:08.160 --> 40:11.060
 He hopped on the back, got him up to West Street,

40:11.060 --> 40:14.120
 jumped off, tried to look for his company,

40:14.120 --> 40:19.040
 where they were and he was never seen again.

40:19.920 --> 40:21.400
 He just ran through the tunnel.

40:21.400 --> 40:24.080
 Ran through the tunnel and he got there

40:24.080 --> 40:26.040
 to help his team, right?

40:26.040 --> 40:26.880
 It's all about the team,

40:26.880 --> 40:28.880
 it's all about the guy right next to you.

40:28.880 --> 40:31.040
 And he's the Tunnel to Towers Foundation, Steven.

40:31.040 --> 40:35.760
 His brother Frank decided in his name in perpetuity,

40:35.760 --> 40:39.160
 he's got a fund that now builds a home

40:39.160 --> 40:41.280
 for every Gold Star family,

40:41.280 --> 40:44.120
 for every seriously battle wounded warrior,

40:44.120 --> 40:47.240
 for every seriously wounded first responder

40:47.240 --> 40:49.720
 or killed in a line of duty first responder.

40:49.720 --> 40:52.780
 If they had a home, they'll pay the mortgage.

40:52.780 --> 40:56.080
 If they didn't have a home, they give them a home.

40:56.080 --> 40:58.800
 And especially if it's a severely battle wounded,

40:58.800 --> 41:00.000
 they give them a smart home

41:00.000 --> 41:03.100
 because these poor guys come home with no limbs.

41:03.100 --> 41:07.920
 And so the beauty of Steven and his selfless act

41:07.920 --> 41:12.200
 was that he's now helped thousands and thousands of people.

41:12.200 --> 41:14.040
 I mean, the Tunnel to Towers is incredible.

41:14.040 --> 41:17.240
 That's part of our mission is to bring awareness

41:17.240 --> 41:19.520
 to these great people at Tunnel to Towers, what they do.

41:19.520 --> 41:24.520
 They've raised $250 million to help protect the protectors,

41:25.480 --> 41:30.040
 to rescue the rescuers in a what's become, unfortunately,

41:30.040 --> 41:33.120
 a somewhat ungrateful society.

41:33.120 --> 41:37.200
 But they will not forget these great guys.

41:37.200 --> 41:39.840
 So you tell Steven's story.

41:39.840 --> 41:42.640
 He's one of the 20 people that you talk about

41:42.640 --> 41:46.980
 in the new Iron Labs 20 for 20 podcast series.

41:46.980 --> 41:50.420
 If you can just linger on his story a little longer,

41:51.920 --> 41:54.120
 what does that tell you about the human spirit?

41:54.120 --> 41:59.120
 That this guy, the Tunnel couldn't drive through,

41:59.400 --> 42:03.160
 so he just puts on that heavy pack and runs.

42:03.160 --> 42:04.360
 What do you make of that?

42:04.360 --> 42:08.640
 That shows the depth of a man's soul.

42:08.640 --> 42:10.240
 He didn't have to do that.

42:10.240 --> 42:13.460
 He could have turned around and went home to his family,

42:13.460 --> 42:15.160
 and nobody would have shamed him.

42:16.220 --> 42:21.080
 But he's one of those beautiful, brave people

42:21.080 --> 42:24.720
 that take a job that really doesn't pay a lot of money.

42:25.600 --> 42:30.600
 And you become a cop or a firefighter or a nurse or an EMT

42:30.600 --> 42:35.600
 or a medic or a soldier or a Marine or airman, sailor.

42:36.200 --> 42:41.200
 When you take these jobs, you don't do it for fanfare.

42:41.920 --> 42:43.840
 You definitely don't do it for money.

42:43.840 --> 42:47.520
 I mean, those 13 brave souls we lost a week or two ago

42:47.520 --> 42:51.240
 in Afghanistan, they're brand new soldiers and Marines.

42:51.240 --> 42:54.120
 They make $22,000 an hour,

42:54.120 --> 42:56.240
 but they don't work 40 hours a week.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.440
 They work 80, they work 90 hours a week.

42:58.440 --> 43:01.240
 So they make it about six bucks an hour.

43:01.240 --> 43:02.080
 And you know what?

43:02.080 --> 43:03.600
 They sign off.

43:03.600 --> 43:07.680
 And firefighters and cops and medics and EMTs,

43:07.680 --> 43:10.840
 nurses, emergency room doctors,

43:10.840 --> 43:12.480
 they don't really make a lot of money.

43:12.480 --> 43:14.980
 I mean, they're starting salary right now for a New York cop.

43:14.980 --> 43:17.440
 I was a New York cop for two years first.

43:17.440 --> 43:22.120
 I made 12.25 an hour back in 1989 to get shot at

43:23.060 --> 43:24.960
 during the crack wars.

43:24.960 --> 43:29.960
 If you made $11 an hour with a family of four,

43:30.160 --> 43:32.160
 you were entitled to welfare back then.

43:33.040 --> 43:38.040
 So I was just above the welfare level, risking my life.

43:38.420 --> 43:41.480
 And these are the guys that are getting ripped up now.

43:41.480 --> 43:42.320
 Right?

43:42.320 --> 43:44.680
 And look, I won't get into any politics,

43:44.680 --> 43:48.560
 but like that says something about someone's soul

43:48.560 --> 43:50.640
 that they're willing to take a job like that

43:50.640 --> 43:53.640
 and get now, get zero respect.

43:53.640 --> 43:56.400
 So a guy like Steven, what that shows is the depth

43:56.400 --> 43:59.600
 of that man's soul and courage and determination.

44:00.840 --> 44:04.280
 It's hard to be selfless in this world anymore,

44:04.280 --> 44:06.260
 but I still know a lot of selfless people

44:06.260 --> 44:09.600
 that just put on equipment every day, bulletproof vests,

44:09.600 --> 44:12.740
 fire bunker gear, stethoscopes,

44:13.640 --> 44:17.440
 you know, flak jackets, military helmets,

44:17.440 --> 44:19.800
 and they go in and they do it smiling.

44:19.800 --> 44:23.680
 That young Marine that passed last week,

44:23.680 --> 44:26.660
 she was photographed and quoted as saying,

44:26.660 --> 44:28.080
 I have my dream job,

44:28.080 --> 44:30.960
 but she was holding a little Afghani baby.

44:30.960 --> 44:33.320
 And she was dead a few days later.

44:33.320 --> 44:36.000
 She was so thrilled to be making $7 an hour

44:36.000 --> 44:36.880
 helping people, right?

44:36.880 --> 44:37.720
 Isn't that huge?

44:37.720 --> 44:38.840
 Like that to me says,

44:39.720 --> 44:42.440
 that's a true sign of character right there.

44:42.440 --> 44:43.880
 And it's important for our society

44:43.880 --> 44:46.120
 to elevate those people as heroes.

44:46.120 --> 44:49.600
 Let me ask you about firefighting.

44:50.480 --> 44:53.720
 What do you think it means to be a great firefighter

44:53.720 --> 44:57.160
 and a great man, a great human being

44:57.160 --> 45:00.040
 in a situation like you were in in 9 11?

45:03.080 --> 45:06.040
 You know, that's kind of a broad term.

45:06.040 --> 45:08.720
 Like some, you know, you can go to different firehouses

45:08.720 --> 45:10.400
 and they might have a different definition

45:10.400 --> 45:12.440
 of what they consider a great firefighter.

45:12.440 --> 45:15.440
 But I think in the industry as a whole,

45:15.440 --> 45:19.800
 if you're willing to put everyone else before you,

45:19.800 --> 45:22.160
 especially your team, you know,

45:22.160 --> 45:24.280
 as we say, there ain't no I in team, right?

45:24.280 --> 45:26.400
 It's T E A M and there's no I in there.

45:26.400 --> 45:29.800
 It's all about those guys and girls next to you.

45:30.760 --> 45:34.520
 If you can do that, that makes you pretty great.

45:34.520 --> 45:38.000
 You put everything else second and you just run in

45:38.000 --> 45:40.600
 and you run in with that team for strangers.

45:40.600 --> 45:43.680
 You know, I've had the honor of,

45:43.680 --> 45:48.680
 I spent almost 25 years of my adult life serving humanity,

45:48.680 --> 45:51.280
 my country, my former city.

45:52.920 --> 45:55.880
 And the people I worked with were giants.

45:55.880 --> 45:57.360
 And I don't mean that in height,

45:57.360 --> 46:00.400
 I mean, but I mean that in spirit and in soul.

46:00.400 --> 46:03.760
 I saw some of the most heroic, selfless acts.

46:04.960 --> 46:06.960
 And then I saw some of the behind the scenes

46:06.960 --> 46:08.040
 that were so impressive.

46:08.040 --> 46:09.440
 You know, we'd go to the movies,

46:09.440 --> 46:13.000
 so impressive, you know, we'd go to a fire around Christmas

46:13.000 --> 46:14.840
 and the family would lose everything.

46:16.120 --> 46:17.680
 And even when I was a cop, same thing,

46:17.680 --> 46:19.600
 you'd come back either to the police precinct

46:19.600 --> 46:21.720
 or the firehouse or the EMS station.

46:23.080 --> 46:24.960
 And someone would put together a collection and say,

46:24.960 --> 46:28.000
 hey guys, hey Lex, 50 bucks a man,

46:28.000 --> 46:29.600
 you know, the Smith's down the street,

46:29.600 --> 46:31.760
 just lost everything, we're gonna go get some presents

46:31.760 --> 46:33.760
 for the kids and some turkeys.

46:33.760 --> 46:36.960
 And not one of those guys questioned that.

46:36.960 --> 46:39.200
 And they were making 12.25 an hour

46:39.200 --> 46:42.280
 and they still came up with 50 bucks for that family.

46:42.280 --> 46:45.280
 But see, that's the stuff the press won't show you, right?

46:45.280 --> 46:49.240
 They don't wanna show that humanity, that soft edge.

46:49.240 --> 46:51.000
 See, when you're a warrior, you need to have

46:51.000 --> 46:54.360
 this rough shield, this rough exterior.

46:54.360 --> 46:55.880
 Cause if you don't, you die.

46:56.840 --> 47:01.840
 But a true great firefighter or responder or a cop

47:02.440 --> 47:06.640
 or military personnel, they have that rough exterior

47:06.640 --> 47:11.360
 with that soft underbelly, that heart, right?

47:11.360 --> 47:14.520
 And that's, to me, the true great ones.

47:14.520 --> 47:17.920
 Some of them, they just have a hard time doing that.

47:17.920 --> 47:20.960
 There's no shame in showing your soft side.

47:20.960 --> 47:23.400
 Well, you got your dad to say I love you back.

47:23.400 --> 47:25.360
 No, that was huge, man.

47:25.360 --> 47:28.360
 That took me 22 years, Lex.

47:28.360 --> 47:31.760
 So you were a firefighter for 21, I was 22 years.

47:31.760 --> 47:33.680
 Why did you become a firefighter?

47:33.680 --> 47:36.760
 Oh, my dad, I mean, I was five years old

47:36.760 --> 47:39.320
 and I went to his firehouse and there was these,

47:39.320 --> 47:42.600
 at the time, they looked like giants to me with mustaches

47:42.600 --> 47:47.520
 and the trucks smelled like smoke and the gear smelled

47:47.520 --> 47:50.880
 like smoke and the tires and the diesel fuel

47:50.880 --> 47:53.880
 and that one was like, this is what I'm gonna do.

47:53.880 --> 47:55.800
 And then they bring you in the kitchen

47:55.800 --> 47:58.760
 and they stuff you with ice cream and cake and everything.

47:58.760 --> 48:02.560
 And then I go home to my mom, shaking with a sugar cone

48:02.560 --> 48:04.760
 and she's mad at my dad, but yeah, it was just,

48:04.760 --> 48:06.320
 oh, I was like, I gotta do this.

48:06.320 --> 48:09.720
 It was like, they were like a baseball team in a garage

48:09.720 --> 48:12.740
 with a truck and these big tools and big coats and helmets

48:12.740 --> 48:14.720
 and they were just laughing and having fun

48:14.720 --> 48:17.040
 and I'm like, yeah, man, I'm doing this.

48:17.040 --> 48:19.480
 And I knew, I was obsessed with it.

48:19.480 --> 48:22.280
 I mean, I was so pissed that the fireman's test came out

48:22.280 --> 48:26.160
 when I was 14 and I couldn't take it, you had to be 18.

48:26.160 --> 48:29.960
 And it was done, the test was graded and whatever.

48:29.960 --> 48:32.800
 So my dad, now there's a copy circulating

48:32.800 --> 48:34.560
 because it's old now.

48:34.560 --> 48:37.260
 And he goes, yeah, yeah, this is what you're in for.

48:37.260 --> 48:40.240
 And I took it and I did it like it was real

48:40.240 --> 48:42.360
 and I got a 99 and I was so pissed.

48:42.360 --> 48:43.680
 I said, I wanna get hired.

48:43.680 --> 48:45.440
 He goes, you can't, you're 14.

48:45.440 --> 48:49.000
 But I just wanted to do it so bad

48:49.000 --> 48:50.800
 and I just wanted to help people.

48:50.800 --> 48:53.680
 I just wanted to be like my dad,

48:53.680 --> 48:56.400
 he'd come home smiling as tired as he was

48:56.400 --> 48:58.560
 and he fought fires in the 60s and 70s

48:58.560 --> 49:01.640
 when the city was burning and he's still

49:01.640 --> 49:04.080
 as exhausted as he was, he'd still be smiling.

49:05.320 --> 49:08.520
 I wanted to smile at work and I used to,

49:08.520 --> 49:10.840
 I got paid to laugh and joke.

49:10.840 --> 49:13.040
 I got paid to cry sometimes.

49:13.040 --> 49:14.560
 But man, we laughed a lot.

49:14.560 --> 49:17.120
 We really, it was, the chop breaking is just,

49:17.120 --> 49:19.360
 it's just unending and it's great.

49:19.360 --> 49:21.400
 If you don't mind, can you tell me,

49:21.400 --> 49:23.460
 you were really kind enough to give me

49:25.220 --> 49:27.760
 one of these shirts with 114.

49:27.760 --> 49:31.160
 Can you tell me the story of 114 and Tally Ho?

49:31.160 --> 49:34.240
 I wear proudly, I served eight years in that command

49:34.240 --> 49:36.560
 and I didn't finish my career there.

49:36.560 --> 49:38.720
 I passed the lieutenant's test

49:38.720 --> 49:40.480
 and once you do, you have to leave.

49:41.600 --> 49:46.280
 The story behind Tally Ho is back in World War II,

49:46.280 --> 49:48.560
 there was this gentleman named Bad Jack Carroll

49:48.560 --> 49:50.840
 and Jack was an airborne ranger

49:50.840 --> 49:53.560
 and my father in law was also on the department

49:53.560 --> 49:54.640
 and he knew Jack.

49:54.640 --> 49:59.120
 And Jack came home, Jack jumped Normandy

49:59.120 --> 50:02.440
 and stormed up through the Battle of the Bulls in Bastogne

50:02.440 --> 50:07.440
 and he came back, greatest generation as they all did

50:07.960 --> 50:10.280
 and they got jobs and they went right to work

50:10.280 --> 50:14.780
 and they were treated better back then, vets, right?

50:14.780 --> 50:16.960
 And he got on the New York City Fire Department

50:16.960 --> 50:19.760
 and he got assigned a ladder 114

50:19.760 --> 50:23.480
 and they first got radios back then

50:23.480 --> 50:25.800
 and when Jack, he would drive the truck,

50:25.800 --> 50:27.480
 you're up there with the officer,

50:27.480 --> 50:28.860
 either the lieutenant or captain,

50:28.860 --> 50:31.160
 so if the boss is off the truck,

50:31.160 --> 50:33.720
 you operate the radio for them as the driver.

50:33.720 --> 50:35.840
 So when they called him and they'd say,

50:35.840 --> 50:38.460
 you know, ladder 114 responding to 52nd Street,

50:38.460 --> 50:40.460
 3rd Avenue, Structure Fire,

50:40.460 --> 50:41.880
 you're supposed to get back and say,

50:41.880 --> 50:44.760
 ladder 114, 10 four, but he refused to do that.

50:44.760 --> 50:47.320
 He'd say, ladder 114, Tally Ho,

50:47.320 --> 50:48.240
 because that's what they'd yell

50:48.240 --> 50:50.200
 when they'd jump out the plane.

50:50.200 --> 50:52.400
 So all these years later, it stuck

50:52.400 --> 50:54.840
 and it's a little bit of a bragging right,

50:54.840 --> 50:58.240
 but out of 350 engine and truck companies

50:58.240 --> 51:00.320
 in the whole New York City Fire Department,

51:00.320 --> 51:01.440
 we're pretty much the only one

51:01.440 --> 51:03.520
 that's called by their nickname on the radio,

51:03.520 --> 51:04.360
 not their number.

51:04.360 --> 51:07.200
 So it tweaked some guys off in other places,

51:07.200 --> 51:09.380
 you know, they may F you, Tally Ho,

51:09.380 --> 51:13.320
 but it's just, yeah, it's a great, great heritage

51:13.320 --> 51:17.520
 and we're really proud and Shamrock was,

51:17.520 --> 51:20.760
 he was Irish and a lot of the guys back then

51:20.760 --> 51:23.120
 were Irish immigrants from the area,

51:23.120 --> 51:23.960
 from the neighborhood,

51:23.960 --> 51:26.040
 and they would actually take the fire truck

51:26.040 --> 51:28.360
 to church on Sunday and park out front

51:28.360 --> 51:31.040
 and one guy would stay in it to hear the radio

51:31.040 --> 51:32.240
 in case they got a call.

51:32.240 --> 51:35.160
 So yeah, that's the proud history.

51:35.160 --> 51:37.320
 And you said that if I wear this around New York,

51:37.320 --> 51:38.280
 am I getting a little bit of?

51:38.280 --> 51:39.600
 You might get a guy from the Bronx,

51:39.600 --> 51:41.600
 go, hey, Tally Ho, screw you, you know?

51:41.600 --> 51:44.640
 But I mean, it's all that good rivalry, you know?

51:44.640 --> 51:47.960
 We like to, you know, we like to kid each other

51:47.960 --> 51:51.400
 back and forth, you know, guys from Manhattan,

51:51.400 --> 51:52.840
 we'll say, yeah, you guys are in Brooklyn,

51:52.840 --> 51:54.840
 yeah, short buildings, tall stories.

51:54.840 --> 51:56.760
 And they're like, yeah, you guys are in Manhattan,

51:56.760 --> 51:59.360
 tall buildings, no stories, you know?

51:59.360 --> 52:02.520
 Like it's just all that jocular ball break

52:02.520 --> 52:04.760
 and it's good stuff, you know?

52:04.760 --> 52:08.200
 Let me ask, I guess, a difficult question.

52:08.200 --> 52:11.560
 If you just step back on the events of 9 11,

52:11.560 --> 52:15.760
 on the side of the people that flew into the towers,

52:15.760 --> 52:20.280
 what do you take away from that day about the nature,

52:20.280 --> 52:23.760
 about human nature, about good and evil?

52:23.760 --> 52:26.200
 How did that change your view of the world?

52:29.000 --> 52:32.480
 I witnessed evil firsthand.

52:32.480 --> 52:35.680
 I remember later on, well into that night

52:35.680 --> 52:38.800
 when we were trying to help get those police officers out,

52:38.800 --> 52:41.320
 I remember looking up at the building, Century 21,

52:41.320 --> 52:45.680
 the store runs along the east side of the towers

52:45.680 --> 52:48.360
 and it was still there and the debris had come down

52:48.360 --> 52:50.040
 right almost to the edge.

52:50.040 --> 52:53.120
 Century 21 is this old storied department store

52:53.120 --> 52:56.360
 in New York City and the sign was there

52:56.360 --> 52:59.600
 and it was still lit up, like some of the neon was broken

52:59.600 --> 53:02.320
 but I think some of it was actually still lit up

53:02.320 --> 53:05.080
 and I just looked around and I was like,

53:05.080 --> 53:08.040
 this is a war zone, like we're at war.

53:08.040 --> 53:11.320
 And we knew we were attacked, we heard the fighter planes

53:11.320 --> 53:15.600
 and back then it wasn't the extensive communication

53:15.600 --> 53:18.120
 network and we had cell phones but they were the old school

53:18.120 --> 53:20.480
 flip phones and there was no news on them

53:20.480 --> 53:24.560
 and so plus we didn't have signal down there anyway.

53:24.560 --> 53:27.640
 I couldn't reach my family for like 12, 13 hours

53:27.640 --> 53:31.120
 and my dad had deployed down to the ferry terminal

53:31.120 --> 53:33.920
 to retrieve bodies.

53:33.920 --> 53:37.720
 He was retired but he still went and they deployed him

53:37.720 --> 53:41.520
 to go be basically the morgue transport guys.

53:41.520 --> 53:44.840
 They expected to be sending hundreds and thousands

53:44.840 --> 53:47.680
 of bodies across on the ferry and they set up

53:47.680 --> 53:50.040
 these tractor trailers as a mobile morgue

53:50.040 --> 53:53.680
 and that never happened because there were no bodies

53:53.680 --> 53:55.440
 to take, they were all buried.

53:58.400 --> 54:01.600
 So I saw evil firsthand, I don't know how someone

54:01.600 --> 54:06.600
 can inflict such revenge or a vengeful act

54:07.640 --> 54:10.680
 in the name of anything, in the name of a religion,

54:10.680 --> 54:14.760
 in the name of a cause, in the name, like what the hell?

54:14.760 --> 54:16.480
 Were you ever able to make sense of that,

54:16.480 --> 54:19.080
 why men are able to commit such acts of terror

54:19.080 --> 54:20.920
 in the days and the years after?

54:22.320 --> 54:23.600
 No, Lex, I haven't.

54:26.000 --> 54:30.160
 My mom's from Ireland and I still have a lot of family there

54:30.160 --> 54:35.160
 and my great uncles, one of them was dragged out and shot.

54:35.800 --> 54:39.520
 He lived but just based on a rumor that he was in the IRA

54:39.520 --> 54:44.520
 and I wasn't happy to see what happened to my mom's people

54:44.720 --> 54:47.720
 because they were victimized and brutalized

54:47.720 --> 54:50.800
 by England at that time.

54:50.800 --> 54:55.680
 But blowing up bombs and killing innocents

54:55.680 --> 54:58.920
 in the name of that, it doesn't make it right.

55:00.080 --> 55:02.280
 I couldn't justify something like that.

55:02.280 --> 55:07.280
 I can see, I was a cop, I was a soldier

55:07.280 --> 55:12.280
 and you never wanna take life and those jobs

55:12.960 --> 55:15.320
 but sometimes you have to.

55:15.320 --> 55:16.920
 But you don't do it with a vengeance,

55:16.920 --> 55:18.400
 you don't do it with a thirst,

55:18.400 --> 55:21.440
 you do it because it's necessary for survival.

55:22.560 --> 55:25.240
 When you do it out of a bloodlust, out of a thirst,

55:25.240 --> 55:28.600
 out of a cause, that's evil, there's something wrong

55:28.600 --> 55:33.600
 with you, I have no, I respect life to the highest level.

55:33.600 --> 55:36.720
 I mean, I'm very, life is sacred to me, it's precious,

55:36.720 --> 55:40.360
 it's beyond, it's not a commodity, it's a gift.

55:42.520 --> 55:45.280
 But to take life just so randomly,

55:45.280 --> 55:47.640
 so there's something way wrong with that person

55:47.640 --> 55:50.320
 and maybe I'm a conflicted soul

55:50.320 --> 55:53.320
 but I would have no problem seeing someone like that

55:53.320 --> 55:56.400
 put to death because they do not deserve life.

55:59.120 --> 56:02.440
 There's many children around me

56:02.440 --> 56:04.480
 and many children around this world

56:04.480 --> 56:07.080
 that are being taught to hate someone

56:07.080 --> 56:10.840
 who's different than them just because the person

56:10.840 --> 56:13.840
 who's allegedly teaching them says so.

56:13.840 --> 56:14.840
 I don't understand it.

56:14.840 --> 56:19.160
 Well, that starts with just having a basic respect

56:19.160 --> 56:21.600
 and appreciation of other human beings

56:21.600 --> 56:24.240
 and that starts with empathy.

56:24.240 --> 56:27.600
 And one of the reasons I love this country,

56:27.600 --> 56:31.120
 while joking that I'm Russian, maybe you could say the same

56:31.120 --> 56:35.320
 as you being Irish, you're actually truly an American

56:35.320 --> 56:37.920
 and that's why I consider myself very much an American.

56:37.920 --> 56:40.360
 And one of the reasons I love this country

56:40.360 --> 56:42.800
 is it serves as a beacon.

56:42.800 --> 56:46.880
 I still believe it serves as a beacon of hope

56:46.880 --> 56:50.280
 and that empathy and love for the rest of the world

56:50.280 --> 56:54.040
 that hate is not gonna get you far,

56:54.040 --> 56:55.680
 that love will get you a lot farther.

56:55.680 --> 56:58.760
 And I still think sometimes it's easy

56:58.760 --> 57:03.760
 to see the press, mainstream media,

57:03.960 --> 57:05.880
 you could see social networks.

57:05.880 --> 57:08.960
 Because you can make so much money on division,

57:08.960 --> 57:11.960
 sometimes because it makes so much money,

57:11.960 --> 57:14.720
 it's easy to think like we're really divided.

57:14.720 --> 57:16.280
 I honestly don't think we are.

57:16.280 --> 57:18.920
 That's just like the very surface level thing

57:18.920 --> 57:20.160
 we see on Twitter and so on.

57:20.160 --> 57:23.320
 It's that you're 100% right.

57:23.320 --> 57:25.200
 There's people out there that are maximizing

57:25.200 --> 57:27.960
 off this whole division, right?

57:27.960 --> 57:30.720
 They want us divided, they want people angry

57:30.720 --> 57:32.680
 because it sells.

57:32.680 --> 57:34.880
 A lot of these people that are in charge

57:34.880 --> 57:38.440
 of certain organizations, well, they all seem to have

57:38.440 --> 57:42.120
 nice cars and nice houses and nice vacations

57:42.120 --> 57:45.640
 and they're constantly trying to convince everybody

57:45.640 --> 57:47.360
 that we hate each other.

57:47.360 --> 57:49.360
 To me, I'll use a fireman analogy, right?

57:49.360 --> 57:51.480
 It's like a little campfire.

57:51.480 --> 57:55.880
 And if you just let the embers flutter, they'll go out.

57:55.880 --> 57:58.560
 But if you take a little cup of gasoline with those embers,

57:58.560 --> 58:01.760
 boom, it'll blow right up in your face.

58:01.760 --> 58:04.280
 And that's what a lot of these politicians

58:04.280 --> 58:06.520
 and a lot of these media folks are doing

58:06.520 --> 58:08.680
 because there's something in it for them.

58:08.680 --> 58:11.360
 And I think it's possible to defeat them

58:11.360 --> 58:14.840
 with great leaders, with great spokespeople,

58:14.840 --> 58:17.000
 with great human beings having a voice.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.240
 One of the powerful things with the internet

58:19.240 --> 58:21.960
 is more and more people have a voice.

58:21.960 --> 58:25.480
 And I ultimately believe, certainly in America,

58:25.480 --> 58:30.280
 but in the world, the good people outnumber the assholes.

58:30.280 --> 58:31.120
 Oh, I agree.

58:31.120 --> 58:33.200
 And there's days when I think the assholes

58:33.200 --> 58:36.860
 are overrunning us, but you know what?

58:38.080 --> 58:41.760
 I think what the downfall of the world is

58:41.760 --> 58:45.760
 is ego and arrogance and people that think they're better

58:45.760 --> 58:47.440
 than that other guy.

58:47.440 --> 58:49.800
 My parents raised me to be this way.

58:49.800 --> 58:52.120
 My mom is such a sweet, gentle soul.

58:52.120 --> 58:52.960
 She's an immigrant.

58:52.960 --> 58:55.040
 She came here at 16 years old.

58:55.040 --> 58:57.680
 She helps everybody but herself, right?

58:57.680 --> 58:59.040
 She's just one of those people.

58:59.040 --> 58:59.880
 She's sick.

58:59.880 --> 59:01.400
 She's got Parkinson's.

59:01.400 --> 59:02.320
 You'd never know it.

59:02.320 --> 59:04.920
 And she's still flying around her condo complex

59:04.920 --> 59:08.040
 helping everybody because that's what she does.

59:08.040 --> 59:10.440
 She loves to help people.

59:10.440 --> 59:12.080
 But she's been in their shoes.

59:12.080 --> 59:13.920
 She's been poor.

59:13.920 --> 59:14.760
 She's sick.

59:14.760 --> 59:15.720
 Her husband was sick.

59:15.720 --> 59:19.640
 She's had all sorts of suffering and loss in her life.

59:19.640 --> 59:23.120
 My granddad died when my mom was 10

59:23.120 --> 59:27.320
 and she was one of 10 children that survived out of 14.

59:27.320 --> 59:32.320
 She knows hard times, but she so appreciates the good times

59:32.960 --> 59:34.860
 and the goodness of this country.

59:35.720 --> 59:38.640
 You know, the fire department

59:38.640 --> 59:40.200
 and the police department, military,

59:40.200 --> 59:41.760
 it taught me a lot about empathy

59:41.760 --> 59:43.920
 and trying to really feel for someone

59:43.920 --> 59:48.000
 and put yourself in their situation.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.920
 I remember years back, I was a much younger fireman.

59:50.920 --> 59:53.520
 I was probably five years on the job.

59:53.520 --> 59:58.520
 And I was sent down to the next firehouse over to fill in.

59:58.600 --> 1:00:00.320
 You know, we would get sent around randomly

1:00:00.320 --> 1:00:02.100
 when they needed an extra guy.

1:00:03.360 --> 1:00:06.840
 And someone came banging on the firehouse door

1:00:06.840 --> 1:00:09.080
 and in the tenement apartment next door,

1:00:09.080 --> 1:00:12.480
 they said there was an older woman that was unconscious.

1:00:12.480 --> 1:00:14.840
 So we dispatched ourselves

1:00:14.840 --> 1:00:17.120
 and we ran over with a medical kit

1:00:17.120 --> 1:00:20.440
 and it was an elderly woman laying there on the bed.

1:00:20.440 --> 1:00:23.640
 And she was obviously not breathing.

1:00:23.640 --> 1:00:26.120
 She was obviously in cardiac arrest

1:00:26.120 --> 1:00:29.360
 and an older gentleman that was holding her hand,

1:00:29.360 --> 1:00:31.880
 just inconsolably crying.

1:00:31.880 --> 1:00:34.080
 And it turned out it was her husband

1:00:34.080 --> 1:00:37.040
 and they were married for 65 years.

1:00:37.040 --> 1:00:40.760
 And normally we would just respectfully ask

1:00:40.760 --> 1:00:43.300
 the family members to just step aside

1:00:43.300 --> 1:00:45.120
 and let us do our work.

1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:47.940
 And I realized that he wouldn't leave her side.

1:00:47.940 --> 1:00:49.960
 So I kind of gave the crew a wink

1:00:49.960 --> 1:00:53.600
 and they were doing CPR on what they had to.

1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:57.000
 And I just let him keep holding her hand.

1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:58.520
 And I said, sir, if you, you know,

1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:02.220
 could you just come over just a little bit so we can work?

1:01:02.220 --> 1:01:06.480
 And I held his hand as he held hers.

1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:09.860
 And I said, sir, I said, do you have faith?

1:01:09.860 --> 1:01:10.700
 And he did.

1:01:10.700 --> 1:01:14.980
 And I said, would you like to pray with me for your wife?

1:01:14.980 --> 1:01:17.300
 And he said, I would like to.

1:01:17.300 --> 1:01:19.200
 So we said the Lord's prayer

1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:23.140
 and you know, I just asked God to protect her and bless her.

1:01:23.140 --> 1:01:27.240
 And I think he realized that she didn't have a chance,

1:01:27.240 --> 1:01:30.960
 but we still gave her that chance.

1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:32.540
 And we, you know, got her in the ambulance

1:01:32.540 --> 1:01:35.640
 and maybe it was wrong to try to make it look

1:01:35.640 --> 1:01:37.000
 like we could save her, but you know,

1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:39.840
 you can't really not try.

1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:44.800
 But the one beautiful moment was he thanked me

1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:49.800
 and he was almost okay with it at that point.

1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:51.040
 Like he wasn't as upset.

1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:54.680
 He wasn't as distraught because I tried to just humanize

1:01:54.680 --> 1:01:56.780
 that situation of what we were trying to do.

1:01:56.780 --> 1:01:58.060
 We were trying to do our best,

1:01:58.060 --> 1:02:01.760
 but we also tried to be compassionate to his sadness.

1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:06.040
 And it just, I walked away just feeling so good,

1:02:06.040 --> 1:02:07.920
 even though it was a tragic situation.

1:02:07.920 --> 1:02:11.800
 And she did pass that, you know, he came by to, you know,

1:02:11.800 --> 1:02:15.240
 thank us days later and just heartbreaking.

1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:17.960
 But you know, there's just, it's just happens many,

1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:21.000
 many times throughout the country every day.

1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.480
 People get that opportunity as a responder to be

1:02:23.480 --> 1:02:27.320
 that last bridge to the family and the loved one.

1:02:27.320 --> 1:02:30.880
 And you only get that opportunity once sometimes

1:02:30.880 --> 1:02:32.980
 and you really have to, to me,

1:02:32.980 --> 1:02:34.260
 it's like your moment to shine.

1:02:34.260 --> 1:02:35.520
 You know, you could just be very,

1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:37.320
 very dismissive and very rude,

1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:40.320
 or you could be compassionate and just show,

1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:43.360
 hey, I have a mom, I have a grandma, I have, you know,

1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:45.760
 and just in your mind, pretend that that's

1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:47.520
 who you're working on and that's who you're with.

1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:50.240
 So that moment of compassion, that moment of empathy,

1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:54.160
 even if his brief can be the thing that saves the person

1:02:54.160 --> 1:02:59.160
 from suffering, make the difference between suffering

1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:01.920
 and overcoming in the face of tragedy.

1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:05.080
 Yes, like I felt that even though obviously his loss

1:03:05.080 --> 1:03:08.120
 was still huge, it just made it a little more bearable

1:03:08.120 --> 1:03:11.240
 and, you know, tried to just take his grief down

1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:14.880
 to a lower level and it made me feel,

1:03:14.880 --> 1:03:17.000
 just feel really good about doing it.

1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.760
 That's a powerful way to see the job of a first responder.

1:03:19.760 --> 1:03:21.560
 Of course, you have to deal with certain aspects

1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:24.240
 of the tragedy, but it's to provide somebody

1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:26.920
 with that moment of compassion.

1:03:26.920 --> 1:03:29.200
 Yeah, and you know, I made it a little habit

1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:30.620
 because sometimes with faith,

1:03:30.620 --> 1:03:32.260
 it's a little bit of a tricky subject.

1:03:32.260 --> 1:03:35.440
 So every time I had someone who died,

1:03:35.440 --> 1:03:37.640
 which unfortunately was many, many times,

1:03:37.640 --> 1:03:40.240
 I would just touch their hand

1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:42.080
 and just say a little quick prayer and just say,

1:03:42.080 --> 1:03:44.960
 look, you know, I hope you're moving on to a better place.

1:03:44.960 --> 1:03:49.960
 I hope if you did have faith that it's strong as you depart

1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:51.280
 and if you didn't have faith,

1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:53.720
 I hope maybe at your last moment that you found some

1:03:53.720 --> 1:03:55.280
 and you just found some closure.

1:03:55.280 --> 1:03:58.520
 So that was just my little ritual, I think.

1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:01.240
 I just, you know, I felt it was important

1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:03.760
 that that person, even though they were a stranger,

1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:06.840
 just had someone there just sort of hoping

1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:09.040
 for the best for them in their last moments.

1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:11.640
 You mentioned cancer.

1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:17.560
 You had a rare leukemia due to all the work

1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:22.520
 that you did at Ground Zero.

1:04:22.520 --> 1:04:25.900
 Can you maybe talk to the experience

1:04:25.900 --> 1:04:28.960
 of just breathing through those days

1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:32.300
 and what that was like, being unable to breathe,

1:04:32.300 --> 1:04:37.300
 being overwhelmed by all of the dust in the air?

1:04:37.300 --> 1:04:42.300
 Yes, the first day especially, we didn't have equipment.

1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:45.780
 We didn't have breathing apparatus

1:04:45.780 --> 1:04:49.160
 and then we were handed little 69 cent

1:04:49.160 --> 1:04:50.880
 hardware store dust mask, you know,

1:04:50.880 --> 1:04:52.160
 it was a little thin paint mask

1:04:52.160 --> 1:04:54.580
 that would just get sweated up

1:04:54.580 --> 1:04:57.520
 and sticking to your face within 30 seconds.

1:04:57.520 --> 1:05:00.520
 So you would just, they were useless.

1:05:00.520 --> 1:05:02.800
 And what you wound up feeling like was

1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:05.160
 that you swallowed a box of razor blades

1:05:05.160 --> 1:05:07.280
 because there was glass and there was cement

1:05:07.280 --> 1:05:09.440
 and it was just so caustic.

1:05:09.440 --> 1:05:12.480
 And I remember that night, you know,

1:05:12.480 --> 1:05:15.520
 when we went back just to get some medical relief

1:05:15.520 --> 1:05:18.960
 for the few hours, we were walking up the hill

1:05:18.960 --> 1:05:20.880
 to the firehouse because they dropped us off

1:05:20.880 --> 1:05:25.320
 like a block away down at Engine 201's quarters

1:05:25.320 --> 1:05:29.400
 and one of the older firemen as we're walking up the block,

1:05:29.400 --> 1:05:31.720
 we're all struggling, we're all having a hard time breathing

1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:33.920
 and just, I mean, I felt like I was dying,

1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:36.920
 literally, it was pretty bad.

1:05:36.920 --> 1:05:39.020
 And I just remember the one guy going out,

1:05:39.020 --> 1:05:39.860
 we're all dead.

1:05:39.860 --> 1:05:41.420
 And I said, no, no, we made it, we made it.

1:05:41.420 --> 1:05:42.680
 He goes, no, you don't get it, kid.

1:05:42.680 --> 1:05:47.520
 He said, we just breathed in poison after poison for hours

1:05:47.520 --> 1:05:50.800
 and then that went into days and then went into months.

1:05:50.800 --> 1:05:54.120
 He says, we're all dead, man, this is gonna take us all.

1:05:54.120 --> 1:05:58.160
 And I thought he was crazy and then now years later,

1:05:58.160 --> 1:06:00.760
 like starting in 03 or 04,

1:06:00.760 --> 1:06:04.160
 guys just started coming down with these really rare

1:06:04.160 --> 1:06:08.440
 and advanced cancers and then it just stopped

1:06:08.440 --> 1:06:11.280
 being a coincidence with the number of guys

1:06:11.280 --> 1:06:14.640
 and they were young, one of the first guys, John McNamara,

1:06:14.640 --> 1:06:18.940
 he was 33 or 34 and he came down colon cancer

1:06:18.940 --> 1:06:23.580
 and it took him quickly in 2000, he was in 2005.

1:06:23.580 --> 1:06:28.420
 And I kind of said to friends and family,

1:06:28.420 --> 1:06:30.420
 I said, I feel like I'm running through a minefield

1:06:30.420 --> 1:06:33.280
 and I wonder when I'm gonna step on my mind

1:06:33.280 --> 1:06:35.940
 because everybody's gonna get sick.

1:06:35.940 --> 1:06:39.440
 And I wasn't feeling well from 2008 on,

1:06:39.440 --> 1:06:43.800
 I couldn't put my finger on it, but I just wasn't right.

1:06:44.660 --> 1:06:49.500
 And in 2011, I failed my medical,

1:06:49.500 --> 1:06:53.400
 my bloods came back horrifically wrong

1:06:53.400 --> 1:06:55.600
 and they pulled me off the truck,

1:06:55.600 --> 1:06:58.160
 but they strung me out for a month,

1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:00.760
 the doctors in the fire department,

1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:03.160
 one of them said my spleen was engorged

1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:05.440
 because I was probably drinking myself to death,

1:07:05.440 --> 1:07:10.280
 like as he said, most of the guys did after 9 11,

1:07:10.280 --> 1:07:12.440
 which was pretty wrong of him and stereotypical,

1:07:12.440 --> 1:07:14.880
 just to stereotype and to categorize

1:07:14.880 --> 1:07:17.320
 and guy couldn't have cared less,

1:07:17.320 --> 1:07:19.740
 he just, he was so crude and nasty.

1:07:19.740 --> 1:07:23.240
 And then my one doctor who was my doctor on the outside,

1:07:23.240 --> 1:07:26.320
 my blood pressure was 240 over 140,

1:07:26.320 --> 1:07:28.800
 my spleen was about to rupture,

1:07:28.800 --> 1:07:30.520
 she didn't even show up for my appointment

1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:34.760
 and I went down, passed out, the paramedics responded,

1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:36.680
 she got into an argument with a paramedic

1:07:36.680 --> 1:07:40.120
 because for big ego and basically telling him

1:07:40.120 --> 1:07:41.320
 there wasn't really anything wrong

1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:43.380
 and he's looking at my paperwork going,

1:07:43.380 --> 1:07:46.900
 this guy's got leukemia and he overrode her,

1:07:46.900 --> 1:07:49.480
 he raced me out of there down to Brooklyn Methodist

1:07:49.480 --> 1:07:54.480
 and the doctor, the charge physician, the ER physician,

1:07:55.640 --> 1:07:58.920
 he says, you're not leaving, you're in a bad way.

1:07:58.920 --> 1:08:00.920
 And I said, what is it?

1:08:00.920 --> 1:08:04.500
 He said, I need a little while to figure it out,

1:08:04.500 --> 1:08:09.200
 he goes, but you probably have one of a few different types

1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:11.080
 of leukemia, he said, I'll drill into your hip,

1:08:11.080 --> 1:08:13.520
 take your marrow and find out.

1:08:13.520 --> 1:08:15.600
 And he said, but in the meantime,

1:08:15.600 --> 1:08:17.320
 we'll get the swelling on the spleen down,

1:08:17.320 --> 1:08:19.880
 I guess some sort of rapid medicines and whatnot

1:08:19.880 --> 1:08:21.900
 because my spleen is about to rupture.

1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:25.800
 I had no blood platelets left which is your clotter

1:08:25.800 --> 1:08:27.880
 so I basically would have bled to death

1:08:27.880 --> 1:08:31.440
 and I found out from my team of doctors

1:08:31.440 --> 1:08:33.520
 that I had about 48 hours to live

1:08:34.840 --> 1:08:37.040
 and that really set me off, I was infuriated

1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:40.320
 because I was telling them for a long time that I was sick.

1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:42.960
 The doctors failed you,

1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:44.800
 the few doctors in the beginning failed you.

1:08:44.800 --> 1:08:48.120
 I felt very betrayed and other guys had died

1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:53.560
 and I had it out with that one doctor,

1:08:53.560 --> 1:08:55.960
 I basically told her she was fired from my case

1:08:55.960 --> 1:08:59.640
 and she's pretty politically in charge person

1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:02.700
 and I didn't care, I jeopardized my job for it

1:09:02.700 --> 1:09:04.800
 because it was my life and I got the sense

1:09:04.800 --> 1:09:07.720
 that it didn't really matter to her.

1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:09.960
 She didn't have any empathy, as you say.

1:09:09.960 --> 1:09:13.920
 It was exact, so why for her, why for a few others,

1:09:13.920 --> 1:09:18.920
 was there not a special care, a special compassion

1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:20.880
 for, first of all, all humans,

1:09:20.880 --> 1:09:22.960
 but human beings in your position,

1:09:22.960 --> 1:09:26.000
 especially a firefighter, a first responder?

1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:28.760
 You know, Alex, I think what it is in the department,

1:09:28.760 --> 1:09:31.300
 their title is just to get us back to duty

1:09:31.300 --> 1:09:35.700
 as quickly as possible when we are either injured or sick

1:09:35.700 --> 1:09:38.680
 because what happens then is your replacement

1:09:38.680 --> 1:09:43.200
 is now in overtime so you're out being paid on medical leave

1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:45.160
 but then they need to replace your spot

1:09:45.160 --> 1:09:47.140
 and then that costs more money.

1:09:47.140 --> 1:09:49.560
 So I think it just behooves them

1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:52.460
 to get as many personnel back

1:09:52.460 --> 1:09:54.360
 and especially during the summertime,

1:09:54.360 --> 1:09:57.000
 they look at it like, oh, maybe you want a few extra days off

1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:02.000
 to go to the beach and this one doctor,

1:10:02.200 --> 1:10:04.680
 he tipped his hand back as if I was drinking

1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:07.600
 an alcohol beverage, he says, hey, busy summer?

1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:09.360
 Because I asked him to look at my spleen

1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:13.000
 which was sticking out of my abdomen like a football

1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:14.640
 and I said, excuse me, sir, I said,

1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:18.000
 how dare you assume that I'm abusing alcohol

1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:22.240
 because alcohol abuse sometimes will present itself

1:10:22.240 --> 1:10:26.160
 as the spleen is engorged and having an issue.

1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:29.060
 So he automatically just assumed that that was my situation,

1:10:29.060 --> 1:10:32.840
 wouldn't even give me an exam and I was horrified.

1:10:32.840 --> 1:10:35.680
 I was so angry, I mean, I wanted to punch this guy out

1:10:35.680 --> 1:10:37.240
 and I literally was screaming at him

1:10:37.240 --> 1:10:41.160
 and an executive officer came in to diffuse it

1:10:41.160 --> 1:10:42.640
 and sent me to another doctor

1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:44.840
 and when I showed her my paperwork, she was horrified.

1:10:44.840 --> 1:10:47.120
 She was like, what did he say?

1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:50.280
 And she said, oh, okay, go to your regular doctor tomorrow

1:10:50.280 --> 1:10:52.160
 who was one of the department doctors

1:10:52.160 --> 1:10:55.520
 and it was just an indifference.

1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:57.200
 It was like, I don't know,

1:10:57.200 --> 1:11:00.800
 I was shocked at the lack of compassion

1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:04.120
 but you know what, that being said, I'm past it,

1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:05.120
 life moves on.

1:11:06.340 --> 1:11:09.780
 The team of doctors, I ended up with a Methodist

1:11:09.780 --> 1:11:13.960
 and my subsequent oncologist, Dr. Peter Menzel,

1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:16.760
 world class, just incredible human being.

1:11:16.760 --> 1:11:18.840
 My Dr. Pete is just, I love him.

1:11:18.840 --> 1:11:21.180
 I just, I love him like a friend, like a big brother,

1:11:21.180 --> 1:11:25.640
 like a father, like my primary oncology care nurse,

1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:28.200
 Mike Nunez, was just an incredible human being

1:11:28.200 --> 1:11:30.000
 and he knew I was frightened

1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:33.720
 because I had to get two and a half years of chemo

1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:37.240
 compressed into seven days or I was dead.

1:11:37.240 --> 1:11:40.680
 And these massive bags of chemo that never stopped

1:11:40.680 --> 1:11:45.680
 and they burned, the minute they went into your body,

1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:47.600
 you felt like you were burning to death

1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:49.280
 from the inside out.

1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:51.880
 And Mike, when Mike came in to hook me up,

1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:54.920
 he said, look, I have to wear a hazmat suit.

1:11:54.920 --> 1:11:57.720
 This stuff is so caustic that if it drips,

1:11:57.720 --> 1:11:59.960
 it'll burn whenever it touches.

1:11:59.960 --> 1:12:02.400
 And I was like, but Mike, you're gonna put that in my body.

1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:04.640
 How the hell is it not gonna kill me?

1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:07.120
 He says, no, no, this is exactly what it's supposed to do.

1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:08.440
 Trust me.

1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:11.540
 So when he prepped the IV tube to get it flowing,

1:12:11.540 --> 1:12:13.000
 it spilled onto the tube

1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.600
 and the tube started to smoke and burn.

1:12:15.600 --> 1:12:18.160
 And I said, no effing way, Mike,

1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:19.240
 you're not putting that in me.

1:12:19.240 --> 1:12:20.760
 No way, no way.

1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:22.440
 And he goes, listen, let me get another one.

1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:23.640
 Let me start it over.

1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:25.600
 And here he is wearing a hazmat suit, looking at me

1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:27.920
 and I'm going, this is insane.

1:12:27.920 --> 1:12:30.400
 And he goes, he looked at me, he took my hand

1:12:30.400 --> 1:12:33.100
 and he says, Nels, if you don't take it, you're dead.

1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:35.980
 He says, you got those three kids.

1:12:35.980 --> 1:12:37.800
 I'm sorry, I have no other option.

1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:38.960
 You're dead.

1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:41.080
 And I said, all right, Mike, okay.

1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:42.560
 And he hooked me up.

1:12:42.560 --> 1:12:45.320
 And you know what, it was like, you know,

1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:47.980
 if you do drink alcohol and you have like a shot

1:12:47.980 --> 1:12:50.880
 or want, you know, strong type spirit

1:12:50.880 --> 1:12:53.140
 and you start feeling that burn.

1:12:53.140 --> 1:12:56.320
 Well, the minute he hit me in the vein,

1:12:56.320 --> 1:12:58.800
 it just started going up my arm, burning

1:12:58.800 --> 1:13:03.440
 and then up my shoulder, across my neck, into my head,

1:13:03.440 --> 1:13:04.680
 across the rest of my body,

1:13:04.680 --> 1:13:06.640
 within a minute down to my feet.

1:13:06.640 --> 1:13:08.920
 And I was writhing in pain for seven days

1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:11.180
 and I was praying to die.

1:13:12.220 --> 1:13:14.480
 I was the seventh rescuer in six months

1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:17.120
 to come down with the rarest leukemia there is.

1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:20.440
 There's only 500 cases in all of North America a year.

1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:22.560
 And seven of us came down in six months.

1:13:22.560 --> 1:13:24.440
 Two guys died during treatment.

1:13:24.440 --> 1:13:26.240
 Seven responders, police, fire.

1:13:27.780 --> 1:13:29.880
 Two guys died in the first couple of days of the treatment

1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:32.240
 because it's so vicious, your liver, your heart,

1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:35.040
 your kidneys, something will fail.

1:13:35.040 --> 1:13:37.520
 And I was praying and I was praying, but I wanted to die.

1:13:37.520 --> 1:13:39.480
 I was in so much pain.

1:13:39.480 --> 1:13:40.880
 And I wouldn't take a painkiller

1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:42.920
 because I know people with some issues

1:13:42.920 --> 1:13:45.200
 and I just didn't want to go there.

1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:48.480
 And finally on the last day I gave in,

1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:50.480
 I said, please, I can't do this anymore.

1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:53.460
 I was literally like jumping out of my skin

1:13:53.460 --> 1:13:55.640
 and they gave me something.

1:13:55.640 --> 1:13:58.100
 But it had burned out my mind, it burned out my body.

1:13:58.100 --> 1:14:01.100
 I couldn't hear, I could barely see, it was vicious.

1:14:01.100 --> 1:14:03.580
 But it worked.

1:14:03.580 --> 1:14:05.740
 And my nurses especially,

1:14:05.740 --> 1:14:08.380
 they just, they were so dedicated and devoted.

1:14:08.380 --> 1:14:10.340
 And I was not an easy patient

1:14:10.340 --> 1:14:11.780
 because I was in a lot of pain.

1:14:11.780 --> 1:14:16.380
 It was bad and it was, drove my friends, my family crazy.

1:14:16.380 --> 1:14:17.900
 It was just, it wasn't good.

1:14:18.860 --> 1:14:22.580
 But on that first night I had a quick vision

1:14:22.580 --> 1:14:26.740
 of all these people that I loved that were dead, that died.

1:14:26.740 --> 1:14:28.860
 A lot of them in a trade center and I saw Johnny,

1:14:28.860 --> 1:14:31.380
 I saw friends I grew up with.

1:14:32.480 --> 1:14:34.460
 The last one was my mother in law

1:14:34.460 --> 1:14:37.500
 who had passed six months before and she died of,

1:14:37.500 --> 1:14:39.460
 she was in a coma, she had a stroke.

1:14:39.460 --> 1:14:42.500
 She had a horrible, horrible last six months of life

1:14:42.500 --> 1:14:45.380
 and it wasn't fair because she was so religious.

1:14:45.380 --> 1:14:49.020
 She went to church every day, devout Catholic woman.

1:14:49.020 --> 1:14:51.100
 And all of a sudden I see her and she's smiling

1:14:51.100 --> 1:14:55.300
 and we used to talk a lot, it's the Irish thing,

1:14:55.300 --> 1:14:56.860
 like the gab, the gift of gab.

1:14:56.860 --> 1:14:59.100
 And she used to call me her boyfriend

1:14:59.100 --> 1:15:00.620
 because we'd sit and talk for hours

1:15:00.620 --> 1:15:03.700
 and talk about books and about movies and about food.

1:15:03.700 --> 1:15:05.400
 I loved her, she was my friend.

1:15:06.300 --> 1:15:08.860
 And she'd say, you know, my boyfriend's here.

1:15:08.860 --> 1:15:10.260
 And all of a sudden she's smiling

1:15:10.260 --> 1:15:11.620
 and she goes, hi, my boyfriend.

1:15:11.620 --> 1:15:13.860
 And I says, Nan, Nan, what are you doing?

1:15:13.860 --> 1:15:16.860
 She goes, he's not ready, he doesn't want you.

1:15:16.860 --> 1:15:19.420
 You gotta go back, you got things to do.

1:15:19.420 --> 1:15:21.500
 And I'm like, no, Nan, Nan, it hurts so much.

1:15:21.500 --> 1:15:23.260
 Please, please take me and she left.

1:15:23.260 --> 1:15:26.140
 She goes, no, no, not yet, I'll see you.

1:15:26.140 --> 1:15:27.480
 And she just faded away.

1:15:28.340 --> 1:15:30.340
 And one of my doctors on my team,

1:15:30.340 --> 1:15:35.340
 she had a problem with religion.

1:15:35.740 --> 1:15:38.140
 And that's okay, I understand that.

1:15:38.140 --> 1:15:40.380
 I'm not a preacher, I have a faith,

1:15:40.380 --> 1:15:41.920
 but I don't preach it, I don't push it.

1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:44.940
 I just live and let live.

1:15:44.940 --> 1:15:47.340
 So she sent in this shrink to see me.

1:15:47.340 --> 1:15:49.940
 And I was messed up from the chemo,

1:15:49.940 --> 1:15:53.340
 but I knew what I was seeing, I knew what I was saying.

1:15:53.340 --> 1:15:56.340
 And he was a Jewish gentleman.

1:15:56.340 --> 1:15:59.420
 He was a rabbi also in a synagogue.

1:15:59.420 --> 1:16:01.380
 And I actually had responded in that district

1:16:01.380 --> 1:16:04.700
 and he knew 114 would run into Borough Park.

1:16:04.700 --> 1:16:08.060
 Oh yeah, I see Tyler, oh, they come down the street.

1:16:08.060 --> 1:16:11.300
 And he asked me to tell him the story and I did.

1:16:11.300 --> 1:16:14.140
 And he started laughing and he scared me now.

1:16:14.140 --> 1:16:15.900
 I says, Doc, am I really crazy?

1:16:15.900 --> 1:16:17.820
 He said, no, no.

1:16:17.820 --> 1:16:19.940
 He said, I believe you, my friend.

1:16:19.940 --> 1:16:23.180
 He said, we share the same God.

1:16:23.180 --> 1:16:25.820
 He goes, we work in the same corporation,

1:16:25.820 --> 1:16:27.700
 but in different departments.

1:16:27.700 --> 1:16:30.660
 And he says, you did see your mother in law.

1:16:30.660 --> 1:16:32.700
 He says, your faith is that strong.

1:16:32.700 --> 1:16:33.980
 He said, I've had many patients

1:16:33.980 --> 1:16:35.860
 express the same sentiments.

1:16:35.860 --> 1:16:38.500
 He said, so I want you to listen to her

1:16:38.500 --> 1:16:40.000
 and fight and be strong.

1:16:40.900 --> 1:16:42.700
 And he said, so what else do you want to talk about?

1:16:42.700 --> 1:16:44.740
 I said, well, I don't know, Doc, am I that messed up?

1:16:44.740 --> 1:16:45.560
 He goes, no, no.

1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:46.740
 He goes, they're paying me for an hour.

1:16:46.740 --> 1:16:48.180
 It only took 20 minutes.

1:16:48.180 --> 1:16:51.180
 So we watched the Yankee game together and that's less.

1:16:51.180 --> 1:16:53.740
 But it was just, again, it showed the human condition.

1:16:53.740 --> 1:16:57.300
 Here's these two men of two totally different faiths.

1:16:57.300 --> 1:17:00.780
 And yet we shared that bond of faith.

1:17:00.780 --> 1:17:03.340
 And he had empathy and he had sympathy.

1:17:03.340 --> 1:17:08.340
 And he saw me in many other patients.

1:17:08.540 --> 1:17:10.020
 So he just didn't assume.

1:17:10.020 --> 1:17:11.860
 And he gave me a fair shake

1:17:11.860 --> 1:17:14.620
 and I will always be grateful to him for that.

1:17:15.480 --> 1:17:18.260
 Through any of this, the pain you had to go through

1:17:18.260 --> 1:17:21.940
 with the leukemia, but also the days of 9 11

1:17:21.940 --> 1:17:24.760
 and after, did your faith get challenged?

1:17:26.060 --> 1:17:28.620
 You know, Lex, it was strange.

1:17:28.620 --> 1:17:30.140
 It was times I was so angry.

1:17:30.140 --> 1:17:31.860
 You know, there's that range of emotions,

1:17:31.860 --> 1:17:36.140
 the anger, the denial, the depression, the this, the that.

1:17:36.140 --> 1:17:37.300
 And this is the weirdest thing.

1:17:37.300 --> 1:17:41.500
 It was mostly, I knew my career was over

1:17:41.500 --> 1:17:43.700
 and they retired me out of the job.

1:17:43.700 --> 1:17:46.700
 That, I got sick in August and that October,

1:17:46.700 --> 1:17:48.580
 they told me I was out.

1:17:48.580 --> 1:17:51.700
 And by the time I was processed and, you know,

1:17:51.700 --> 1:17:54.980
 used up my leaves and whatever you want to say it was,

1:17:54.980 --> 1:17:58.300
 I was officially retired in January of 02

1:17:59.420 --> 1:18:01.980
 and it was less than six months.

1:18:01.980 --> 1:18:03.820
 And I'm there walking my dog one day,

1:18:03.820 --> 1:18:05.580
 my rescued Greyhound who I miss.

1:18:05.580 --> 1:18:06.860
 She was such a soul.

1:18:06.860 --> 1:18:09.020
 God, she lived to be almost 13, Katie.

1:18:09.020 --> 1:18:12.220
 And we were walking in the snow and I got the call.

1:18:12.220 --> 1:18:14.000
 I was retired and I looked at her and I'm like,

1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:15.180
 Katie, what am I going to do?

1:18:15.180 --> 1:18:16.740
 She just looked up and said, we're going to go

1:18:16.740 --> 1:18:18.700
 on a lot more walks, you know?

1:18:18.700 --> 1:18:22.580
 And I was so sad and I was so sad and I was so angry

1:18:22.580 --> 1:18:24.060
 because I lost my priesthood.

1:18:24.060 --> 1:18:25.180
 I loved helping people.

1:18:25.180 --> 1:18:28.140
 I really, like I would have done it for free.

1:18:28.140 --> 1:18:30.900
 I would never tell Mayor Bloomberg that, right?

1:18:30.900 --> 1:18:32.180
 He's all about the buck, right?

1:18:32.180 --> 1:18:33.380
 But like, you know, honestly,

1:18:33.380 --> 1:18:35.180
 I would have been a New York City fireman.

1:18:35.180 --> 1:18:37.660
 I would have paid them to do it, you know?

1:18:37.660 --> 1:18:40.500
 And I wasn't allowed anymore.

1:18:40.500 --> 1:18:41.340
 That's it.

1:18:41.340 --> 1:18:43.660
 You have over 20 years and you have cancer.

1:18:43.660 --> 1:18:45.020
 You know, back when my dad got sick,

1:18:45.020 --> 1:18:47.780
 they'd let you hang around for 10, 12 years in an office,

1:18:47.780 --> 1:18:49.140
 but not now.

1:18:49.140 --> 1:18:50.940
 Now it's all about the bottom line.

1:18:53.220 --> 1:18:55.580
 But I was more depressed about losing a job

1:18:55.580 --> 1:18:57.220
 than almost losing my life.

1:18:57.220 --> 1:18:59.200
 Like, as crazy as that sounds, you know?

1:18:59.200 --> 1:19:00.860
 And it just...

1:19:00.860 --> 1:19:01.940
 It was more than a job.

1:19:01.940 --> 1:19:04.260
 I mean, it's a way of life.

1:19:04.260 --> 1:19:05.100
 Oh, man, yeah.

1:19:05.100 --> 1:19:07.460
 It also is your family, your father,

1:19:07.460 --> 1:19:10.540
 your carrying torture, your father's...

1:19:10.540 --> 1:19:11.360
 Oh, my friend.

1:19:11.360 --> 1:19:12.200
 I love my friends.

1:19:12.200 --> 1:19:14.420
 I love, we worked 24 hour shifts together.

1:19:14.420 --> 1:19:17.300
 You cook, you clean, you break each other's jobs

1:19:17.300 --> 1:19:18.140
 relentlessly.

1:19:18.140 --> 1:19:20.920
 I mean, I love those guys so much.

1:19:20.920 --> 1:19:24.420
 I mean, I hope that my kids

1:19:24.420 --> 1:19:25.960
 and anyone that I know and care about,

1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:30.960
 I hope they can experience the bond of that brotherhood

1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:32.740
 that I experienced in my life.

1:19:32.740 --> 1:19:33.580
 It was so...

1:19:33.580 --> 1:19:36.140
 God, I would give anything to have it back.

1:19:36.140 --> 1:19:37.580
 Just, yeah.

1:19:37.580 --> 1:19:39.260
 Can I ask you about New York?

1:19:39.260 --> 1:19:42.260
 So unfortunately, I've never lived in New York.

1:19:42.260 --> 1:19:43.100
 I visit.

1:19:43.100 --> 1:19:44.860
 I've always wanted to live there for a bit.

1:19:44.860 --> 1:19:47.020
 Obviously, it's a very different experience

1:19:47.020 --> 1:19:50.280
 to have really lived in New York for many, many years.

1:19:50.280 --> 1:19:54.700
 But there's a few friends of mine that are from...

1:19:54.700 --> 1:19:56.620
 They got similar accent as yours.

1:19:56.620 --> 1:19:57.460
 Yeah.

1:19:57.460 --> 1:20:00.660
 That are a little bit saddened.

1:20:00.660 --> 1:20:03.900
 Perhaps it's temporary, but perhaps not.

1:20:03.900 --> 1:20:07.180
 They don't seem to think so of what New York has become,

1:20:07.180 --> 1:20:08.660
 especially with COVID.

1:20:08.660 --> 1:20:12.300
 It's losing some of the spirit of New York.

1:20:12.300 --> 1:20:13.560
 Do you have that sense?

1:20:13.560 --> 1:20:15.640
 Do you have a hope for the city

1:20:15.640 --> 1:20:19.520
 that has been so defining to what is America?

1:20:21.060 --> 1:20:22.700
 My heart's broken.

1:20:22.700 --> 1:20:25.620
 I had moved to New Jersey many years ago,

1:20:25.620 --> 1:20:27.660
 but I still have a close attachment to New York.

1:20:27.660 --> 1:20:30.940
 My parents are still there, many, many family members.

1:20:32.340 --> 1:20:34.300
 And I've since now moved to Tennessee.

1:20:34.300 --> 1:20:36.780
 I needed to go somewhere quiet.

1:20:36.780 --> 1:20:38.860
 I wanted to heal my fractured soul.

1:20:38.860 --> 1:20:43.860
 And I'm in the middle of a beautiful farming rural area

1:20:43.860 --> 1:20:45.060
 in middle Tennessee.

1:20:45.060 --> 1:20:48.740
 And so they probably called me a sellout

1:20:48.740 --> 1:20:50.020
 back in New York for leaving,

1:20:50.020 --> 1:20:52.900
 but it's not the same city and it's sad.

1:20:54.140 --> 1:20:58.320
 I'll refrain from the politics and the finger pointing,

1:20:59.340 --> 1:21:01.580
 but it's a mess compared to what it was.

1:21:01.580 --> 1:21:06.180
 And I did Broadway theater security for many years,

1:21:06.180 --> 1:21:09.060
 and I started to see it slide

1:21:09.060 --> 1:21:11.860
 like with stuff that was happening,

1:21:11.860 --> 1:21:15.340
 like public urination and defecation

1:21:15.340 --> 1:21:18.820
 and just like tourists don't wanna see that, right?

1:21:18.820 --> 1:21:23.820
 And I had an unfortunate incident two years ago.

1:21:24.320 --> 1:21:27.740
 I was jumped by four teenagers coming off the subway

1:21:28.780 --> 1:21:29.900
 and they were pissed off

1:21:29.900 --> 1:21:31.860
 because I was wearing an American flag hat.

1:21:31.860 --> 1:21:36.100
 And I don't know, I'm not really sure why,

1:21:36.100 --> 1:21:40.120
 but it left me, I got out of it, okay.

1:21:40.120 --> 1:21:43.200
 But I was taken back.

1:21:43.200 --> 1:21:44.600
 They were literally videoing it

1:21:44.600 --> 1:21:47.300
 and the kid was just throwing shadow punches at my face

1:21:47.300 --> 1:21:48.220
 wanting to beat me up.

1:21:48.220 --> 1:21:50.080
 And I finally looked him in the eyes and I was like,

1:21:50.080 --> 1:21:52.900
 oh boy, I'm a little too old for this.

1:21:52.900 --> 1:21:54.620
 Body's a little broken down for chemo.

1:21:54.620 --> 1:21:56.860
 And I finally just said, all right, all right.

1:21:56.860 --> 1:21:59.260
 I just had enough, I wanted to go home.

1:21:59.260 --> 1:22:02.580
 Just worked a 17 hour shift as a stage hand.

1:22:02.580 --> 1:22:04.660
 And I was so taken back, I was so insulted.

1:22:04.660 --> 1:22:07.980
 I'm saying, I spent my life protecting this city

1:22:07.980 --> 1:22:10.660
 and now I'm getting attacked like for nothing.

1:22:10.660 --> 1:22:12.220
 And I just, I gave up

1:22:12.220 --> 1:22:14.460
 and maybe I should have given it a little more time,

1:22:14.460 --> 1:22:19.140
 but it's, I don't know, it's turned into an angry place.

1:22:19.140 --> 1:22:22.820
 It's turned into, I think there's a lot of people

1:22:22.820 --> 1:22:26.180
 that aren't getting the resources they need in a sense.

1:22:26.180 --> 1:22:27.580
 There's a lot of mental illness.

1:22:27.580 --> 1:22:29.380
 There's a lot of homelessness.

1:22:29.380 --> 1:22:31.360
 There's a lot of violent people

1:22:31.360 --> 1:22:33.940
 just roaming around the streets and it's not good.

1:22:33.940 --> 1:22:35.420
 It's not safe.

1:22:35.420 --> 1:22:38.900
 And tourists are not gonna come back.

1:22:38.900 --> 1:22:40.580
 Even just leading up to the COVID,

1:22:40.580 --> 1:22:43.180
 I had some tourists saying to me, I won't be back.

1:22:43.180 --> 1:22:44.660
 And now I can only imagine

1:22:44.660 --> 1:22:46.580
 that it's just gotten exponentially worse,

1:22:46.580 --> 1:22:49.220
 but I hope there's a chance it'll swing back.

1:22:49.220 --> 1:22:50.980
 Cause it is, it's the gateway to the world.

1:22:50.980 --> 1:22:55.580
 I mean, my grandfather came from Denmark.

1:22:55.580 --> 1:22:58.140
 He landed in Ellis Island in the twenties.

1:22:59.140 --> 1:23:01.900
 American success story, 25 bucks in his pocket,

1:23:01.900 --> 1:23:03.940
 didn't speak the language,

1:23:03.940 --> 1:23:06.860
 had a sponsor family in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.

1:23:06.860 --> 1:23:09.300
 And he made it, you know, he ended up dying

1:23:09.300 --> 1:23:13.020
 owning a bakery at one point and then an apartment building.

1:23:13.020 --> 1:23:14.500
 And he did pretty well for himself

1:23:14.500 --> 1:23:16.960
 for an immigrant who was poor.

1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:20.420
 And my mom, my Irish mother landed in the same neighborhood,

1:23:20.420 --> 1:23:24.060
 Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, 16 years old.

1:23:24.060 --> 1:23:27.540
 Worked as a cashier 50, 60 hours a week in the supermarket

1:23:27.540 --> 1:23:29.040
 and finished school at night.

1:23:29.040 --> 1:23:32.760
 Married my father, the fireman,

1:23:32.760 --> 1:23:36.000
 and, you know, lived the American dream.

1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:37.800
 And it was all, it was all from New York.

1:23:37.800 --> 1:23:40.640
 And my father's mom was from Irish immigrants

1:23:41.540 --> 1:23:43.520
 and they all landed in Ellis Island.

1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:45.960
 Well, my mom didn't cause it was closed at that point,

1:23:45.960 --> 1:23:49.800
 but it's, there's people breaking down the doors

1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:51.640
 to come to this country, right?

1:23:51.640 --> 1:23:55.160
 There's no one breaking down the doors to leave.

1:23:55.160 --> 1:23:56.600
 And this is, this is a problem I have

1:23:56.600 --> 1:23:58.740
 with people that aren't grateful for being here.

1:23:58.740 --> 1:24:00.480
 And this, again, it's not political,

1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:03.440
 just straight down the middle fastball.

1:24:03.440 --> 1:24:06.600
 If you don't like it here, I'll show you the door.

1:24:06.600 --> 1:24:08.460
 I'll get you the plane ticket.

1:24:08.460 --> 1:24:10.560
 I mean, would you want to live back in Russia

1:24:10.560 --> 1:24:11.440
 compared to here?

1:24:11.440 --> 1:24:13.600
 Would you, you might because of family ties,

1:24:13.600 --> 1:24:16.120
 but I mean, if you had no ties to Russia

1:24:16.120 --> 1:24:18.040
 or would you want to go to China right now

1:24:18.040 --> 1:24:21.280
 and possibly end up in a labor camp or, right?

1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:24.320
 There's people busting down the doors to get to this place.

1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:25.540
 It's not perfect.

1:24:25.540 --> 1:24:29.440
 It's got its flaws, it's got its blemishes, you know,

1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:32.560
 but it's a damn great place.

1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:34.360
 It's the best country in the world.

1:24:34.360 --> 1:24:36.320
 Yeah, and some of it, so first of all,

1:24:36.320 --> 1:24:37.540
 I have hope for New York.

1:24:37.540 --> 1:24:40.880
 I think that culture is very difficult to kill.

1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:42.920
 I think it will persevere.

1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:45.400
 And I think ultimately the same story with New York

1:24:45.400 --> 1:24:48.080
 as with the rest of the United States,

1:24:48.080 --> 1:24:49.720
 it has to do with leaders.

1:24:49.720 --> 1:24:53.320
 And I'm always hopeful that great leaders will emerge.

1:24:53.320 --> 1:24:54.160
 I agree.

1:24:54.160 --> 1:24:58.000
 And the kind of leadership we see now

1:24:58.000 --> 1:24:59.720
 and the kind of conversations we have now,

1:24:59.720 --> 1:25:04.440
 I think it has to do with the prosperity and comfort.

1:25:04.440 --> 1:25:06.080
 And in the face of hardship,

1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:07.680
 I think great leaders will emerge.

1:25:07.680 --> 1:25:11.160
 And yeah, I just think ultimately

1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:13.400
 in the long arc of history.

1:25:13.400 --> 1:25:15.200
 Well, leaders shouldn't become rich.

1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:17.280
 They shouldn't become rich in the process, right?

1:25:17.280 --> 1:25:20.040
 You shouldn't go into political office

1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:23.720
 as an alleged lunchbox kind of guy

1:25:23.720 --> 1:25:26.840
 and then come out eating at the best steakhouse in the world.

1:25:26.840 --> 1:25:30.120
 I mean, that's the problem with politics, right?

1:25:30.120 --> 1:25:33.140
 My Irish grandmother, God rest her, used to say,

1:25:33.140 --> 1:25:35.540
 oh, those politicians, they're all like dirty diapers.

1:25:35.540 --> 1:25:37.520
 They're full of shit and they stink.

1:25:37.520 --> 1:25:38.360
 And it's true.

1:25:38.360 --> 1:25:40.280
 I don't give a crap what party they're in.

1:25:40.280 --> 1:25:41.560
 Yeah, greed and power.

1:25:41.560 --> 1:25:42.880
 We had to beg these guys,

1:25:42.880 --> 1:25:45.800
 beg them for federal legislation

1:25:45.800 --> 1:25:47.840
 to cover our medical bills, right?

1:25:47.840 --> 1:25:49.240
 There's a gentleman, John Field

1:25:49.240 --> 1:25:51.300
 from the Feel Good Foundation.

1:25:51.300 --> 1:25:54.280
 This guy is a lion of a man, a general,

1:25:54.280 --> 1:25:57.320
 but with a soft, big, great heart.

1:25:57.320 --> 1:26:00.840
 And John is a former construction worker

1:26:00.840 --> 1:26:05.120
 who came to the 9.11 site the day after.

1:26:05.120 --> 1:26:08.440
 He was one of those guys cutting the steel with torches

1:26:08.440 --> 1:26:09.920
 and craning it out of the air.

1:26:09.920 --> 1:26:12.520
 One of those hard hats that just,

1:26:12.520 --> 1:26:16.860
 that never got the credit and the praise

1:26:16.860 --> 1:26:18.880
 that we did as responders.

1:26:18.880 --> 1:26:21.560
 And I don't mean that as a knock to responders, right?

1:26:21.560 --> 1:26:25.640
 I mean, we lost 37 Port Authority police officers,

1:26:25.640 --> 1:26:27.660
 23 NYPD officers,

1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:33.040
 about a dozen emergency medical technicians and paramedics,

1:26:34.200 --> 1:26:36.400
 three court officers from New York State courts

1:26:36.400 --> 1:26:38.280
 and two federal agents,

1:26:38.280 --> 1:26:41.200
 and I hope, and 343 New York City firefighters.

1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:43.660
 We lost a ton of responders.

1:26:43.660 --> 1:26:46.400
 But the recovery workers,

1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:48.800
 thankfully weren't killed in that process,

1:26:48.800 --> 1:26:53.360
 but there's hundreds of them now who are dead from illnesses

1:26:53.360 --> 1:26:55.860
 because they came down to recover our people

1:26:55.860 --> 1:26:58.380
 and the civilians and the poor lost souls

1:26:58.380 --> 1:27:01.080
 that were killed at work that day.

1:27:01.080 --> 1:27:05.040
 And John literally almost lost his foot

1:27:05.040 --> 1:27:07.400
 in a construction accident at the site.

1:27:07.400 --> 1:27:12.400
 An 8,000 pound I beam tore off half of his foot,

1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:16.200
 ended up with massive sepsis, six months in the hospital,

1:27:16.200 --> 1:27:19.540
 hundreds of thousand dollars in medical bills,

1:27:19.540 --> 1:27:21.840
 and then no one wanted to pay him.

1:27:21.840 --> 1:27:23.480
 So here's a guy, he's gonna lose his house,

1:27:23.480 --> 1:27:25.620
 lose his life, lose everything.

1:27:25.620 --> 1:27:29.520
 And now the never forget, it started quick, right?

1:27:30.520 --> 1:27:33.000
 And he went on a mission,

1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:35.200
 formed his Feel Good Foundation.

1:27:35.200 --> 1:27:38.160
 His last name is Feel, F E A L, Feel Good Foundation.

1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:43.160
 And this man literally went to Washington, DC

1:27:43.200 --> 1:27:45.420
 with his army, as he called it.

1:27:45.420 --> 1:27:47.520
 And I was honored and blessed to be with him

1:27:47.520 --> 1:27:48.720
 a couple, only a couple times.

1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:51.680
 I wish I had dedicated some more time to it.

1:27:53.840 --> 1:27:56.320
 And what it was with John is he set out on a mission

1:27:56.320 --> 1:27:59.440
 to get, and initially what he did is he got funding

1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:02.280
 to take care of responders who were in that limbo,

1:28:02.280 --> 1:28:04.000
 who couldn't get their medical bills paid,

1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:05.320
 who couldn't make their mortgages,

1:28:05.320 --> 1:28:07.180
 who couldn't make their car payments,

1:28:07.180 --> 1:28:09.760
 who couldn't make their childcare payments.

1:28:09.760 --> 1:28:12.080
 And John just took it upon his own to get donations

1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:14.920
 and take care of you while you were suffering, right?

1:28:14.920 --> 1:28:16.640
 I got a call when I got out of hospital.

1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:17.480
 You okay?

1:28:17.480 --> 1:28:18.300
 You need anything?

1:28:18.300 --> 1:28:19.200
 I said, who is this?

1:28:19.200 --> 1:28:20.520
 It's John Feel.

1:28:20.520 --> 1:28:22.240
 I said, aren't you that constructor?

1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:23.840
 Yeah, you need anything?

1:28:23.840 --> 1:28:25.160
 I'm pretty good right now.

1:28:25.160 --> 1:28:26.600
 I said, I appreciate it.

1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:27.960
 Phone ring again a few weeks later.

1:28:27.960 --> 1:28:29.920
 Hey, John Feel, you need anything?

1:28:29.920 --> 1:28:31.880
 I'm like, this guy's incredible.

1:28:31.880 --> 1:28:33.400
 But there's people who needed stuff

1:28:33.400 --> 1:28:35.040
 and he was getting it done.

1:28:35.040 --> 1:28:38.960
 And he, with his army, had to chase these politicians

1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:40.800
 through the halls of Congress

1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:44.200
 to get funding to cover the medical bills.

1:28:44.200 --> 1:28:46.420
 I was getting sued for $125,000

1:28:46.420 --> 1:28:48.840
 for my month stay in the cancer ward.

1:28:49.760 --> 1:28:52.400
 And I couldn't believe it.

1:28:52.400 --> 1:28:53.920
 I said, well, wait a minute, I have insurance.

1:28:53.920 --> 1:28:56.540
 They're like, oh, no, no, this is terrorism related.

1:28:56.540 --> 1:28:57.920
 We don't cover that.

1:28:57.920 --> 1:29:00.020
 So usually then workers comp will cover

1:29:00.020 --> 1:29:01.960
 your on duty injury or illness.

1:29:01.960 --> 1:29:04.460
 Oh, no, no, no, leukemia is not covered under that.

1:29:04.460 --> 1:29:05.800
 We don't cover that.

1:29:05.800 --> 1:29:08.220
 So then the ping pong game starts

1:29:08.220 --> 1:29:10.520
 and I'm literally have people showing up,

1:29:10.520 --> 1:29:13.400
 taking pictures of my kids in front of the house.

1:29:13.400 --> 1:29:15.480
 And I went and grabbed the guy one day by the collar.

1:29:15.480 --> 1:29:16.720
 So who the hell are you?

1:29:16.720 --> 1:29:18.800
 Sir, I'm a private investigator.

1:29:18.800 --> 1:29:20.280
 We're putting a lien on this property

1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:21.920
 due to a nonpayment of a bill.

1:29:21.920 --> 1:29:23.520
 I said, okay, I understand.

1:29:23.520 --> 1:29:24.400
 Do your job.

1:29:24.400 --> 1:29:25.800
 Let me bring my kids inside.

1:29:25.800 --> 1:29:27.280
 Take all the pictures you want.

1:29:27.280 --> 1:29:28.700
 Don't step on my front lawn.

1:29:29.880 --> 1:29:31.480
 And I went in the house.

1:29:32.440 --> 1:29:36.540
 I closed my room, my door, my door, my room, and I cried.

1:29:36.540 --> 1:29:38.200
 I said, I can't believe this.

1:29:38.200 --> 1:29:42.000
 I spent my entire adult life trying to help people,

1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:45.920
 give of myself, and I can't even get my medical bill paid.

1:29:45.920 --> 1:29:48.200
 Well, John Field got my medical bill paid.

1:29:48.200 --> 1:29:51.400
 He finally got these politicians with his team,

1:29:51.400 --> 1:29:54.240
 firefighter Ray Pfeiffer, who has since died,

1:29:54.240 --> 1:29:59.240
 fought with terminal cancer for nine years in a wheelchair.

1:30:00.080 --> 1:30:01.800
 Literally at the end, came out of hospice

1:30:01.800 --> 1:30:05.360
 to go finalize getting us this coverage.

1:30:06.200 --> 1:30:11.160
 Detective Luis Alvarez, who testified days before he died

1:30:11.160 --> 1:30:15.640
 in front of Congress, and a bunch of other guys

1:30:15.640 --> 1:30:17.360
 that were really, really sick,

1:30:17.360 --> 1:30:19.960
 and we had to shame these people into signing on.

1:30:19.960 --> 1:30:22.120
 And luckily we had John Stewart come on

1:30:22.120 --> 1:30:25.040
 and literally just hound these guys

1:30:25.040 --> 1:30:27.320
 and shame them and embarrass them.

1:30:28.320 --> 1:30:31.440
 And what it all stemmed from was in 2006,

1:30:31.440 --> 1:30:35.960
 the first death that was determined to be linked to 9 11,

1:30:35.960 --> 1:30:36.800
 there was others,

1:30:36.800 --> 1:30:39.260
 but the first one that was officially linked

1:30:39.260 --> 1:30:42.240
 was a New York City police detective who initially,

1:30:42.240 --> 1:30:44.660
 the city said he died of advanced lung disease.

1:30:44.660 --> 1:30:47.200
 His lungs were protruding out of his body.

1:30:47.200 --> 1:30:49.960
 And he was on painkillers and it was so bad at the end

1:30:49.960 --> 1:30:52.920
 that the doctor said, just grind them up, snort them,

1:30:52.920 --> 1:30:56.000
 drink it, whatever you need to do to get instant relief.

1:30:56.000 --> 1:30:57.720
 So when they found the talcum

1:30:57.720 --> 1:31:00.020
 from the pill lining in his lungs,

1:31:00.020 --> 1:31:02.440
 they said, oh no, this is opiate abuse.

1:31:02.440 --> 1:31:04.200
 He didn't die of lung disease.

1:31:04.200 --> 1:31:07.160
 So they said, and the mayor was quoted as saying,

1:31:07.160 --> 1:31:08.940
 he is not a hero.

1:31:08.940 --> 1:31:10.960
 Well, shame on you, Mr. Mayor.

1:31:10.960 --> 1:31:12.600
 He was a hero.

1:31:12.600 --> 1:31:15.720
 And his father, who was a retired police chief,

1:31:15.720 --> 1:31:18.060
 married up with the Feel Good Foundation

1:31:18.060 --> 1:31:22.180
 and John Stewart and Ray Pfeiffer, Detective Alvarez.

1:31:23.420 --> 1:31:25.320
 And they got us all covered.

1:31:25.320 --> 1:31:26.920
 But it took so long.

1:31:26.920 --> 1:31:28.180
 Like it was so heartbreaking.

1:31:28.180 --> 1:31:32.000
 These people who were lining up three deep politicians,

1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:34.400
 three deep to catch a picture with a responder

1:31:34.400 --> 1:31:37.040
 so they can tweet, hashtag never forget

1:31:37.040 --> 1:31:40.400
 and hashtag look at me and hey, how am I doing?

1:31:40.400 --> 1:31:41.520
 All that bull crap.

1:31:41.520 --> 1:31:43.960
 They were nowhere to be freaking found.

1:31:43.960 --> 1:31:48.080
 I literally witnessed them hiding in cloak rooms,

1:31:48.080 --> 1:31:51.120
 running down hallways away from us, those freaking cowards.

1:31:51.120 --> 1:31:52.560
 That's cowardice.

1:31:52.560 --> 1:31:54.600
 Can I just linger on the John Stewart thing,

1:31:54.600 --> 1:31:56.640
 the comedian, actor, John Stewart,

1:31:57.840 --> 1:32:00.320
 his testimony before Congress over the benefits

1:32:00.320 --> 1:32:02.560
 for 9 11 first responders.

1:32:02.560 --> 1:32:05.480
 I mean, there's a lot of important human beings

1:32:05.480 --> 1:32:08.920
 in the story, but he has a big voice.

1:32:08.920 --> 1:32:10.320
 And he spoke from the heart.

1:32:10.320 --> 1:32:12.600
 What do you make of that testimony?

1:32:12.600 --> 1:32:13.720
 Oh, it was heartfelt.

1:32:13.720 --> 1:32:16.200
 I mean, he spoke.

1:32:16.200 --> 1:32:20.920
 Look, I mean, John was a polarizing guy, right?

1:32:20.920 --> 1:32:22.560
 There's certain things like over the years,

1:32:22.560 --> 1:32:24.680
 he was cutting edge and I might not have agreed

1:32:24.680 --> 1:32:28.360
 with all of his, you know, some stuff, some not, right?

1:32:28.360 --> 1:32:30.120
 You know, like we all, but I tell you,

1:32:30.120 --> 1:32:31.040
 I found him as funny.

1:32:31.040 --> 1:32:33.240
 I enjoyed his humor.

1:32:33.240 --> 1:32:35.000
 I would love the two of you to have a conversation.

1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:37.760
 No, but again, I love a guy where you can have,

1:32:37.760 --> 1:32:39.240
 you can have a difference in opinions.

1:32:39.240 --> 1:32:41.080
 That's the beautiful thing about the firehouse kitchen.

1:32:41.080 --> 1:32:44.080
 I mean, it could get raucous and now, I don't know,

1:32:44.080 --> 1:32:45.680
 it's a little different situation,

1:32:45.680 --> 1:32:48.600
 but I mean, back in the day, some funny stuff.

1:32:48.600 --> 1:32:52.120
 But yeah, John, John literally just took his talents.

1:32:52.120 --> 1:32:54.480
 You would think he was speaking from the heart

1:32:54.480 --> 1:32:57.400
 of a fireman or a cop or a soldier or a Marine,

1:32:57.400 --> 1:32:59.000
 you know, someone who was there.

1:33:00.800 --> 1:33:04.880
 But I think he especially got to know Ray so well

1:33:04.880 --> 1:33:09.160
 and Ray had this stack of mask cards from, you know,

1:33:09.160 --> 1:33:11.560
 the funeral cards they give out.

1:33:11.560 --> 1:33:13.600
 It looks like, you know, a larger business card

1:33:13.600 --> 1:33:15.240
 that's laminated.

1:33:15.240 --> 1:33:18.080
 And Ray had a stack of them he would carry around.

1:33:18.080 --> 1:33:20.040
 I think it was close to a hundred cards

1:33:21.360 --> 1:33:23.880
 and John saw it and he said, what's that?

1:33:23.880 --> 1:33:25.240
 He says, these are my cards.

1:33:25.240 --> 1:33:26.120
 He said, for what?

1:33:26.120 --> 1:33:28.560
 He says, for my brother's funerals.

1:33:28.560 --> 1:33:32.040
 He was like, oh my God, you've been to that many funerals?

1:33:32.040 --> 1:33:35.880
 He goes, yeah, this is just the ones I made.

1:33:35.880 --> 1:33:39.720
 Like, you know, and John, I think was just stunned.

1:33:41.320 --> 1:33:44.040
 And John actually had that stack of cards

1:33:44.040 --> 1:33:48.040
 after Ray passed and like said, look, look at these.

1:33:48.040 --> 1:33:50.080
 There's gonna be more of these cards.

1:33:50.080 --> 1:33:52.320
 We have one guy a week or girl,

1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:55.320
 one responder or a recovery worker

1:33:55.320 --> 1:33:58.240
 or someone who actually resided down there.

1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:00.800
 There's more than one a week dying.

1:34:00.800 --> 1:34:04.000
 It's one a day dying on average.

1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:06.240
 And on average, two people are diagnosed

1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:09.280
 with a 9 11 cancer or disease.

1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:11.080
 Right now, the worst part is

1:34:11.080 --> 1:34:14.720
 there's autoimmune diseases flying off the graph

1:34:14.720 --> 1:34:17.440
 and they're not covered under the legislation.

1:34:17.440 --> 1:34:19.440
 By the grace of God, my cancer is covered.

1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:22.520
 If my cancer comes back, I mean, I'm in remission.

1:34:22.520 --> 1:34:25.320
 It's technically incurable, but I've been blessed

1:34:25.320 --> 1:34:28.360
 I'm staying ahead of this stuff going on 10 years.

1:34:28.360 --> 1:34:31.960
 But if it comes back with a vengeance tomorrow and takes me,

1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:33.800
 at least my wife will get my pension

1:34:33.800 --> 1:34:36.640
 and be able to live her life without fear.

1:34:36.640 --> 1:34:38.400
 But my friends who are suffering

1:34:38.400 --> 1:34:41.600
 from these advanced autoimmunes, their wives get nothing.

1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:43.560
 Their pension dies with them.

1:34:43.560 --> 1:34:47.600
 And we're hoping that John and his army

1:34:47.600 --> 1:34:51.480
 can shame these politicians once again

1:34:51.480 --> 1:34:55.600
 to have the kindness and decency to cover these autoimmunes.

1:34:55.600 --> 1:34:58.160
 You know, they're throwing a lot of money around

1:34:58.160 --> 1:34:59.520
 at a lot of things lately.

1:34:59.520 --> 1:35:03.060
 And this is one that they won't.

1:35:03.060 --> 1:35:05.800
 And these are lives in the balance who really need it.

1:35:05.800 --> 1:35:08.140
 And John had this strong line.

1:35:08.140 --> 1:35:12.880
 They did their jobs, do yours, talking to the politicians.

1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:13.840
 Yeah.

1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:17.320
 And it's a strong wake up call

1:35:17.320 --> 1:35:21.760
 that it's not about the Twitter or the social media

1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:23.280
 or all that kind of stuff.

1:35:23.280 --> 1:35:26.280
 You have a job to do and you have to,

1:35:26.280 --> 1:35:30.960
 it's that compassion implemented in the form of money

1:35:30.960 --> 1:35:33.860
 of helping people that were there for you

1:35:33.860 --> 1:35:35.400
 when you needed help.

1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:36.760
 Well, we had a guy, I mean,

1:35:36.760 --> 1:35:38.960
 I might get audited out of this one, I hope not,

1:35:38.960 --> 1:35:41.560
 but we had a Congressman from out West,

1:35:41.560 --> 1:35:44.600
 I won't say where, but he prided himself on saying

1:35:44.600 --> 1:35:49.400
 he was a retired cop, a busy cop, 22 years.

1:35:49.400 --> 1:35:52.280
 He said no on the legislation.

1:35:52.280 --> 1:35:56.160
 I witnessed a cop who was dying get out of his wheelchair

1:35:56.160 --> 1:36:00.080
 and said, hey brother, I got a half a million dollars

1:36:00.080 --> 1:36:02.240
 in medical bills and I'm a short timer.

1:36:02.240 --> 1:36:03.720
 I got a few months to live.

1:36:03.720 --> 1:36:06.000
 Who the F is gonna pay him?

1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:07.000
 Do the right thing.

1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:09.440
 You say you're a cop, you show me you're a cop

1:36:09.440 --> 1:36:11.240
 and you sign that paper.

1:36:11.240 --> 1:36:13.480
 And the guy started tearing up the Congressman

1:36:13.480 --> 1:36:16.120
 and he signed it, but he had to be freaking shamed.

1:36:16.120 --> 1:36:17.120
 And you know what he said?

1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:18.900
 Well, this doesn't really confront me.

1:36:18.900 --> 1:36:21.440
 This is pork as far as my district is concerned.

1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:23.520
 He goes, oh yeah, do you know there's 10 guys

1:36:23.520 --> 1:36:25.400
 from your district who came across the country

1:36:25.400 --> 1:36:27.240
 to help us that are also dying?

1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:28.800
 He had no idea.

1:36:28.800 --> 1:36:30.120
 He had no idea.

1:36:30.120 --> 1:36:32.000
 And that's the sad part about Alex.

1:36:33.280 --> 1:36:34.820
 It's a failure in leadership.

1:36:37.260 --> 1:36:39.280
 I think some people would vote for Mickey Mouse

1:36:39.280 --> 1:36:40.400
 just because if he ran.

1:36:40.400 --> 1:36:42.000
 I mean, I have no offense against Mickey Mouse.

1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:43.240
 I like him, he's a good guy, right?

1:36:43.240 --> 1:36:44.360
 I mean, but like, I mean.

1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:45.180
 Allegedly.

1:36:45.180 --> 1:36:46.020
 Allegedly, supposedly.

1:36:46.020 --> 1:36:46.840
 We don't know.

1:36:46.840 --> 1:36:47.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:52.680
 But seriously, I look at some of the leaderships sometimes

1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:54.640
 and go, we're in trouble.

1:36:54.640 --> 1:36:57.680
 And also you lose, I think the way government

1:36:57.680 --> 1:37:00.720
 is structured is people who are senators

1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:04.120
 or people who are in Congress,

1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:07.400
 they start playing a game between each other

1:37:07.400 --> 1:37:10.700
 and they lose track of the connection to the people,

1:37:10.700 --> 1:37:12.240
 to the basic humanity.

1:37:12.240 --> 1:37:15.640
 So you forget, even when you think of yourself as a cop,

1:37:15.640 --> 1:37:20.640
 you forget what are like the cops and the other people

1:37:21.440 --> 1:37:23.480
 servicing the community actually experiencing

1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:25.120
 all the troubles they're going through

1:37:25.120 --> 1:37:26.640
 and how they can actually be helped

1:37:26.640 --> 1:37:27.840
 because you lose touch to that

1:37:27.840 --> 1:37:28.960
 because you're not actually living,

1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:31.360
 you're not talking to them, you're not living among them.

1:37:31.360 --> 1:37:33.680
 And I mean, that's a natural part of the system,

1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:36.040
 but I think that's why character and great leadership

1:37:36.040 --> 1:37:41.040
 is important is you say you leave the game of Congress

1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:43.400
 and you go back to the people.

1:37:43.400 --> 1:37:46.200
 I mean, that's what the country,

1:37:46.200 --> 1:37:48.640
 it's like the George Washington ideal

1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:51.320
 is you're not playing a game of power.

1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:54.040
 You're ultimately see yourself as somebody who's servicing

1:37:54.040 --> 1:37:55.680
 this country's service in the community

1:37:55.680 --> 1:37:58.040
 and that requires talking to the people

1:37:58.040 --> 1:37:59.440
 in their time of hardship.

1:37:59.440 --> 1:38:01.840
 Well, you have some people serving

1:38:01.840 --> 1:38:05.120
 in congressional districts don't even live in that district.

1:38:05.120 --> 1:38:06.760
 I mean, so how are they gonna empathize?

1:38:06.760 --> 1:38:09.880
 They're not even driving through there on a daily basis.

1:38:09.880 --> 1:38:14.880
 And again, when anything becomes lucrative

1:38:16.400 --> 1:38:20.880
 from a financial standpoint, it blurs people's vision.

1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:22.760
 You have to take the potential

1:38:22.760 --> 1:38:26.240
 of becoming rich out of politics.

1:38:26.240 --> 1:38:28.760
 Politics is public service.

1:38:28.760 --> 1:38:32.640
 Police and fire and EMS are public service,

1:38:32.640 --> 1:38:36.160
 but cops and firemen and medics don't walk out

1:38:37.200 --> 1:38:41.920
 of their career with gazillion dollar contracts

1:38:41.920 --> 1:38:43.640
 with this company and that company

1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:46.120
 on that board of directors and this board of directors.

1:38:46.120 --> 1:38:49.080
 They walk out with a pension and that's it.

1:38:49.080 --> 1:38:51.240
 And you have to wonder the intentions

1:38:51.240 --> 1:38:52.800
 of people getting into politics.

1:38:52.800 --> 1:38:57.480
 Are they truly going into to help the human condition

1:38:57.480 --> 1:38:59.880
 or are they trying to help their own damn condition

1:38:59.880 --> 1:39:01.880
 with their wallet and their pocketbook?

1:39:01.880 --> 1:39:04.800
 And I try to lean toward the latter lately

1:39:04.800 --> 1:39:05.640
 with what I'm seeing out there.

1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:07.160
 Well, some of them are the good ones

1:39:07.160 --> 1:39:10.080
 and that's our job as a society is to elevate the good ones.

1:39:10.080 --> 1:39:15.080
 That's it and that has to do with the ideals that we elevate.

1:39:15.080 --> 1:39:19.960
 There are a number of conspiracy theories

1:39:19.960 --> 1:39:22.080
 around the events of 9 11.

1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:24.560
 Do any of these hold true to you

1:39:24.560 --> 1:39:28.320
 or do they just frustrate you, even anger you?

1:39:30.280 --> 1:39:34.360
 I've been asked this by a few different people in my life.

1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:38.280
 This is my take on it, right?

1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:41.280
 You're a man of science and a man of education.

1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:42.760
 So you...

1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:43.600
 Allegedly.

1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:47.080
 Allegedly, but yes, but you're a very, very intelligent man.

1:39:47.080 --> 1:39:52.080
 And what I believe took place is this.

1:39:52.520 --> 1:39:56.360
 Structural steel will fail

1:39:56.360 --> 1:40:01.360
 at a sustained temperature of 1500 degrees Fahrenheit.

1:40:01.400 --> 1:40:03.120
 And I don't know exactly how long

1:40:03.120 --> 1:40:07.760
 that would have to be sustained, but that's the temp, right?

1:40:07.760 --> 1:40:12.360
 Diesel fuel, kerosene fuel, kerosene based jet fuel,

1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:16.200
 which was the ignition there burns

1:40:16.200 --> 1:40:19.040
 at 2200 degrees Fahrenheit.

1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:24.040
 So that continued burning of that diesel, that jet fuel,

1:40:24.640 --> 1:40:27.080
 but kerosene based, it's all kind of similar

1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:32.040
 exceeded the temperature needed for that steel

1:40:32.040 --> 1:40:35.160
 in the structural members of the trade center to fail.

1:40:36.760 --> 1:40:40.560
 In my heart of hearts, I would hate to ever think

1:40:40.560 --> 1:40:44.480
 that somebody affiliated with our government

1:40:44.480 --> 1:40:49.480
 with some sort of agenda would perpetrate that crime

1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:54.680
 and that tragic just destruction of humanity and property

1:40:56.120 --> 1:40:57.840
 for some other form of gain.

1:40:59.040 --> 1:41:01.000
 Those planes rammed into those buildings

1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:03.240
 at 450 miles an hour.

1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:05.240
 They were loaded with thousands and thousands

1:41:05.240 --> 1:41:06.480
 of gallons of jet fuel.

1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:10.240
 Number seven trade center had the backup

1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:14.320
 for the emergency management system for the city.

1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:18.440
 And it was an emergency generator in that complex

1:41:18.440 --> 1:41:23.440
 which had a 25,000 gallon tank of diesel fuel

1:41:23.800 --> 1:41:28.080
 to continually run for weeks to keep the 911 system,

1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:32.960
 the backup system going in the case of a catastrophic event.

1:41:32.960 --> 1:41:37.040
 Well, that tank in seven heated up from the fire

1:41:37.040 --> 1:41:39.600
 that was already going on from the aircraft debris

1:41:39.600 --> 1:41:41.160
 coming into the building.

1:41:41.160 --> 1:41:45.720
 So once that diesel became ignited in seven,

1:41:45.720 --> 1:41:50.040
 now you had enough temperature to fail that steel

1:41:50.040 --> 1:41:51.360
 in that building.

1:41:51.360 --> 1:41:54.960
 So I would like to truly believe what I've learned

1:41:54.960 --> 1:41:57.240
 from the minimal fire science knowledge I have

1:41:57.240 --> 1:42:02.240
 from my career, that it was just a matter of,

1:42:02.240 --> 1:42:06.800
 it burned too long, it burned too hot and it failed.

1:42:06.800 --> 1:42:09.560
 I mean, if you look at the way it came down,

1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:12.200
 it came down as it was designed to

1:42:12.200 --> 1:42:14.320
 in the God forbid event that it was to collapse.

1:42:14.320 --> 1:42:17.880
 It came down pancaking upon itself.

1:42:17.880 --> 1:42:20.640
 If it had failed horizontally

1:42:20.640 --> 1:42:24.480
 and just sprayed out side to side,

1:42:24.480 --> 1:42:26.240
 those buildings would have dropped for a quarter,

1:42:26.240 --> 1:42:27.980
 half a mile up to Canal Street.

1:42:29.840 --> 1:42:30.680
 But you know, Lex, I can't.

1:42:30.680 --> 1:42:32.760
 The fire and the destruction that could have resulted.

1:42:32.760 --> 1:42:35.120
 Yeah, oh my gosh, it could have been so much worse.

1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:38.160
 I mean, you would have taken out every building

1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:41.180
 from that point all the way up.

1:42:41.180 --> 1:42:43.000
 But in my heart, I'd like to just believe

1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:46.120
 that it was just a fire that burned too long and too hot.

1:42:46.120 --> 1:42:49.540
 These planes cause structural damage upon impact

1:42:49.540 --> 1:42:53.240
 in both buildings and it was just a matter of time.

1:42:53.240 --> 1:42:56.040
 And then you think about it, you add all the plastics,

1:42:56.040 --> 1:42:58.400
 all the carpeting, all of the stuff

1:42:58.400 --> 1:43:00.100
 that was burning on those floors.

1:43:00.100 --> 1:43:02.360
 You add that to that fire load.

1:43:03.400 --> 1:43:05.920
 I think it just had enough to collapse it.

1:43:05.920 --> 1:43:09.560
 And you were in building seven for part of that day.

1:43:09.560 --> 1:43:12.040
 I was just after it came down as well.

1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:15.960
 We were aside it and we weren't in it or next to it

1:43:15.960 --> 1:43:17.920
 when it actually did come down.

1:43:17.920 --> 1:43:20.580
 But moments after we were there.

1:43:20.580 --> 1:43:25.580
 And again, I would like to believe that it just,

1:43:25.640 --> 1:43:28.400
 it was just that that fuel was going

1:43:28.400 --> 1:43:33.280
 and it just took its physics, took its course and it failed.

1:43:34.140 --> 1:43:37.200
 So physics and science aside, it's hard.

1:43:38.240 --> 1:43:40.640
 It's both I would like to believe

1:43:40.640 --> 1:43:43.100
 and it's hard to imagine that anybody would be so evil

1:43:43.100 --> 1:43:45.440
 as to orchestrate parts of this

1:43:45.440 --> 1:43:47.620
 from within the United States government.

1:43:47.620 --> 1:43:50.560
 That's very difficult for me to imagine.

1:43:50.560 --> 1:43:52.620
 You know what though, Lex, there's people

1:43:52.620 --> 1:43:55.100
 and I won't elaborate, I won't get into it.

1:43:55.100 --> 1:43:58.940
 Any controversial subjects or what have you.

1:44:00.020 --> 1:44:02.600
 There's some people that don't have any problem at all

1:44:02.600 --> 1:44:04.480
 perpetrating any level of evil.

1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:07.320
 People like you and I who have hearts

1:44:07.320 --> 1:44:09.320
 and we have depth of soul.

1:44:09.320 --> 1:44:11.640
 We couldn't imagine it, but there's other people

1:44:11.640 --> 1:44:13.400
 wouldn't even be a second thought.

1:44:13.400 --> 1:44:17.600
 I mean, I've seen some horrific incidents in my career

1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:20.840
 that I go home shaking my head at night going,

1:44:20.840 --> 1:44:23.960
 human beings are just, they're not wired right.

1:44:23.960 --> 1:44:26.240
 You know, I mean, I look at animals, I love animals,

1:44:26.240 --> 1:44:28.200
 I love dogs especially, right.

1:44:28.200 --> 1:44:33.160
 And I see this dog park when I train to fly airplanes now

1:44:33.160 --> 1:44:35.100
 and something I wanted to do.

1:44:35.100 --> 1:44:37.320
 And there's a dog park across from the airport

1:44:37.320 --> 1:44:40.720
 and there's 60 dogs and there's bones flying up in the air

1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:43.120
 and chew toys and sticks and they're running around

1:44:43.120 --> 1:44:44.920
 having the time of their life, right.

1:44:46.040 --> 1:44:47.640
 And they're all getting along

1:44:47.640 --> 1:44:48.840
 and they're not hurting each other.

1:44:48.840 --> 1:44:50.600
 They're not violating each other.

1:44:50.600 --> 1:44:53.160
 They're not canceling each other.

1:44:53.160 --> 1:44:56.720
 And I'm going, we really need to learn from these dogs.

1:44:56.720 --> 1:44:57.600
 Like, right.

1:44:57.600 --> 1:44:59.880
 And like, I just, yeah.

1:44:59.880 --> 1:45:01.520
 I mean, sometimes it sounds crazy,

1:45:01.520 --> 1:45:04.960
 but I think they're a better species than people.

1:45:04.960 --> 1:45:07.240
 Unless they're rabid, they don't hurt on purpose.

1:45:07.240 --> 1:45:09.440
 They don't, you know, they don't cut you off in traffic

1:45:09.440 --> 1:45:10.600
 and throw you the middle finger.

1:45:10.600 --> 1:45:15.600
 And you know, they just don't do these acts of humanity

1:45:16.420 --> 1:45:18.600
 that sometimes are so vicious.

1:45:18.600 --> 1:45:20.860
 Why do you think these conspiracy theories

1:45:20.860 --> 1:45:24.960
 of which there's a lot take hold?

1:45:24.960 --> 1:45:27.120
 Why do you think so many people believe

1:45:27.120 --> 1:45:31.800
 some version of different conspiracy theories around 9 11?

1:45:31.800 --> 1:45:34.180
 Well, you know, like many things in life,

1:45:34.180 --> 1:45:35.640
 it leaves me a little conflicted.

1:45:35.640 --> 1:45:38.260
 I have to say this, I am at the point now,

1:45:38.260 --> 1:45:40.160
 I don't know who to believe anymore.

1:45:40.160 --> 1:45:44.760
 So I could see that lending a hand to someone

1:45:44.760 --> 1:45:47.440
 who's already a doubter going, oh yeah, look,

1:45:47.440 --> 1:45:49.600
 exactly, that's what they're doing, right.

1:45:49.600 --> 1:45:52.440
 I mean, you know, look at this whole virus.

1:45:52.440 --> 1:45:54.400
 Like, who do you believe?

1:45:54.400 --> 1:45:56.160
 Like, where'd it come from?

1:45:56.160 --> 1:46:00.000
 You know, like, and you know, if you plant that seed,

1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:02.560
 it's like that little campfire

1:46:02.560 --> 1:46:04.000
 we were talking about earlier, right?

1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:06.660
 You just toss a little gas into those embers.

1:46:06.660 --> 1:46:08.200
 You got a fire now.

1:46:08.200 --> 1:46:09.800
 I also think there's a lot of people

1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:12.760
 with a hell of a lot of extra time on their hands, right?

1:46:12.760 --> 1:46:14.000
 And they're really bored.

1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:14.840
 You know?

1:46:14.840 --> 1:46:15.660
 And the two are combined.

1:46:15.660 --> 1:46:17.480
 Alex, yeah, man, you know, like, look,

1:46:17.480 --> 1:46:19.000
 I was a three job Charlie, right?

1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:21.840
 You know, one guy used to say to me, anything but home.

1:46:21.840 --> 1:46:24.960
 I go, no, I got deadlines, responsibilities.

1:46:24.960 --> 1:46:28.800
 You know, like, that's what it comes down to is like,

1:46:28.800 --> 1:46:33.120
 I mean, look, we all have our hobbies and things we like

1:46:33.120 --> 1:46:34.920
 and, you know, little nuances.

1:46:34.920 --> 1:46:36.660
 And that's what makes us special.

1:46:36.660 --> 1:46:37.500
 We're unique.

1:46:37.500 --> 1:46:40.000
 Every person is a unique being.

1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:43.560
 But I also think some people just,

1:46:43.560 --> 1:46:46.000
 they want to cling to something.

1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:48.800
 Like, we all want to feel accepted and belong to something.

1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:52.160
 So all of a sudden you group up with these people

1:46:52.160 --> 1:46:53.960
 and you all believe this fervently.

1:46:53.960 --> 1:46:55.680
 Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, they did it.

1:46:55.680 --> 1:46:56.520
 They took it down.

1:46:56.520 --> 1:46:57.340
 They took it down.

1:46:57.340 --> 1:46:59.840
 And now you start going, yeah.

1:46:59.840 --> 1:47:02.440
 And I think what happens is when you're in company of people

1:47:02.440 --> 1:47:05.120
 and you start telling each other the same thing often,

1:47:05.120 --> 1:47:06.560
 you freaking believe it.

1:47:06.560 --> 1:47:08.640
 I mean, if you keep telling me I got a gray head of hair,

1:47:08.640 --> 1:47:09.520
 I'm going to go, you know what?

1:47:09.520 --> 1:47:10.360
 I do.

1:47:10.360 --> 1:47:11.180
 But no, I don't.

1:47:11.180 --> 1:47:12.020
 I mean, right?

1:47:12.020 --> 1:47:13.080
 I got that waving bye bye do.

1:47:13.080 --> 1:47:14.340
 But like, but you know,

1:47:14.340 --> 1:47:17.040
 I think when you start hearing something often,

1:47:17.040 --> 1:47:18.620
 you start believing it.

1:47:18.620 --> 1:47:19.460
 But I'm not going to,

1:47:19.460 --> 1:47:21.000
 I'm not going to doubt their intelligence.

1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:22.600
 I'm not going to doubt their intentions,

1:47:22.600 --> 1:47:25.920
 but I just don't see it as being plausible.

1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:28.340
 I just, I, it would be too,

1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:33.920
 too big of an operation to successfully happen.

1:47:33.920 --> 1:47:37.360
 I, you know, I mean, look, there's other things that,

1:47:37.360 --> 1:47:40.160
 you know, I won't say it on the interview there,

1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:43.120
 but like I have my doubts with certain things,

1:47:43.120 --> 1:47:45.040
 you know, that, that.

1:47:45.040 --> 1:47:49.580
 I mean, conspiracy theories take hold for a reason.

1:47:49.580 --> 1:47:50.940
 Cause some of them are true.

1:47:50.940 --> 1:47:52.460
 No, yeah.

1:47:52.460 --> 1:47:55.060
 The hard thing is just to know which ones is the problem.

1:47:55.060 --> 1:47:56.700
 When you don't have facts, right?

1:47:57.700 --> 1:47:58.860
 Or you don't know who to trust.

1:47:58.860 --> 1:47:59.920
 Sometimes when you don't have facts,

1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:03.100
 when you don't have figures and you don't have science,

1:48:03.100 --> 1:48:05.540
 it's hard to take someone's word on it.

1:48:05.540 --> 1:48:06.940
 You know, I had a conversation

1:48:06.940 --> 1:48:08.460
 with someone a while back, right?

1:48:08.460 --> 1:48:13.080
 And the guy's like, just, just dedicated atheist.

1:48:13.080 --> 1:48:16.300
 And he thinks I'm an idiot for believing in God.

1:48:16.300 --> 1:48:18.220
 And he's like, yo, you're one of those jerks

1:48:18.220 --> 1:48:19.220
 who believes in creation.

1:48:19.220 --> 1:48:20.980
 And I said, well, I do.

1:48:20.980 --> 1:48:23.020
 Well, what about the big bang theory?

1:48:23.020 --> 1:48:25.260
 He's going on his diatribe about the science

1:48:25.260 --> 1:48:26.700
 and the gases and the chemistry.

1:48:26.700 --> 1:48:27.740
 And I'm going, dude,

1:48:27.740 --> 1:48:30.980
 I barely got through high school chemistry, slow down.

1:48:30.980 --> 1:48:33.300
 And he went on a tangent and all of a sudden I stopped.

1:48:33.300 --> 1:48:38.300
 I went, who, who created the gas and the molecules

1:48:39.100 --> 1:48:41.780
 and the stuff you're talking about and the collisions?

1:48:41.780 --> 1:48:44.740
 And he was furious and stoned off.

1:48:44.740 --> 1:48:45.740
 And I got him.

1:48:45.740 --> 1:48:47.540
 And again, I had no facts.

1:48:47.540 --> 1:48:48.380
 I had no figure.

1:48:48.380 --> 1:48:51.060
 He didn't either, but I stumped him.

1:48:51.980 --> 1:48:54.260
 But sometimes when you can't show something,

1:48:54.260 --> 1:48:56.940
 people need to see something tangible.

1:48:56.940 --> 1:48:59.860
 They need to see it in their hand to believe it.

1:48:59.860 --> 1:49:02.540
 And that's the real hard thing about faith.

1:49:02.540 --> 1:49:04.380
 I see it in action.

1:49:04.380 --> 1:49:06.560
 People restore my faith.

1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:07.660
 And then I say to myself, well,

1:49:07.660 --> 1:49:09.780
 there can't be that many dummies in this world

1:49:09.780 --> 1:49:11.780
 if there's so many billions of us believing

1:49:11.780 --> 1:49:13.860
 in this higher power, this higher, right?

1:49:13.860 --> 1:49:16.540
 I mean, and you said, you said earlier,

1:49:16.540 --> 1:49:20.620
 like you believe most people are good and I do too.

1:49:20.620 --> 1:49:24.840
 The bad outshine the good because the bad get the press.

1:49:24.840 --> 1:49:25.680
 Right?

1:49:25.680 --> 1:49:26.740
 If it bleeds, it leads.

1:49:26.740 --> 1:49:28.900
 That's just, you know, like, think about it.

1:49:28.900 --> 1:49:32.360
 How many more damn zombie apocalypse movies can we make?

1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:33.200
 Right?

1:49:33.200 --> 1:49:34.340
 I didn't even know there was that many zombies.

1:49:34.340 --> 1:49:35.180
 Yeah.

1:49:35.180 --> 1:49:36.440
 And it just seems like every other show

1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:38.140
 is just guys like, you know,

1:49:38.140 --> 1:49:40.660
 bashing each other's heads in with bats with nails in it.

1:49:40.660 --> 1:49:41.900
 And it's like, after a while, it's like,

1:49:41.900 --> 1:49:44.180
 all right, gosh, you gotta get a new boogeyman here.

1:49:44.180 --> 1:49:45.020
 You know, right?

1:49:45.020 --> 1:49:46.360
 Like, but seriously, like.

1:49:47.540 --> 1:49:49.460
 But meanwhile, human civilization

1:49:49.460 --> 1:49:50.380
 is getting better and better.

1:49:50.380 --> 1:49:52.580
 We're just like making Hollywood movies.

1:49:52.580 --> 1:49:53.400
 They just.

1:49:53.400 --> 1:49:54.240
 No, we're getting better and better,

1:49:54.240 --> 1:49:55.660
 but we're treating each other worse and worse.

1:49:55.660 --> 1:49:57.180
 You would think with all this technology

1:49:57.180 --> 1:49:59.080
 and all the knowledge and all the,

1:49:59.080 --> 1:50:01.820
 it's like, what the hell is going on sometimes?

1:50:01.820 --> 1:50:04.380
 Like, I really want to see the good.

1:50:04.380 --> 1:50:06.540
 And I think maybe, maybe the level of bad

1:50:06.540 --> 1:50:08.660
 that we're seeing was always existent.

1:50:08.660 --> 1:50:11.340
 It's just now everything is instantaneous news

1:50:11.340 --> 1:50:13.540
 and flashes and tweets and this and this.

1:50:13.540 --> 1:50:15.820
 Like, like, you know.

1:50:15.820 --> 1:50:17.440
 Well, with the technology we have,

1:50:17.440 --> 1:50:18.540
 it's also come to the light.

1:50:18.540 --> 1:50:20.660
 So you get to see all these fights.

1:50:20.660 --> 1:50:22.660
 It almost, I think that's step one

1:50:22.660 --> 1:50:25.540
 of dealing with the problem is revealing it

1:50:25.540 --> 1:50:27.260
 in its full beautiful light.

1:50:27.260 --> 1:50:28.180
 Oh yeah.

1:50:28.180 --> 1:50:29.980
 How much of a bickering species we are.

1:50:29.980 --> 1:50:32.300
 50 years ago, a guy like me who loves to talk,

1:50:32.300 --> 1:50:33.980
 how the hell would I have gotten an opportunity

1:50:33.980 --> 1:50:36.300
 to have someone listen to me and have, right?

1:50:36.300 --> 1:50:37.140
 I love this.

1:50:37.140 --> 1:50:37.960
 This is amazing.

1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:38.800
 It's cool.

1:50:38.800 --> 1:50:41.100
 But like, but you didn't have that arena.

1:50:41.100 --> 1:50:42.500
 You didn't have all these things.

1:50:42.500 --> 1:50:45.940
 My grandfather, Nels, God rest him, he died in 1979.

1:50:45.940 --> 1:50:47.420
 I mean, that dude didn't even want to have

1:50:47.420 --> 1:50:48.420
 a checking account.

1:50:48.420 --> 1:50:51.220
 He would walk to each store, each, the phone company,

1:50:51.220 --> 1:50:54.780
 the gas company, this company, and pay the bill in person.

1:50:54.780 --> 1:50:56.220
 He didn't trust the bank.

1:50:57.300 --> 1:51:00.660
 And it was like, now, ATMs, this, that,

1:51:00.660 --> 1:51:01.620
 he would be overwhelmed.

1:51:01.620 --> 1:51:04.100
 He'd be just like, I mean, I love my dad,

1:51:04.100 --> 1:51:07.220
 but to watch him on his iPad is comical, right?

1:51:07.220 --> 1:51:09.620
 He calls my niece's boyfriend, who's a tech guy,

1:51:09.620 --> 1:51:12.100
 Matt, Matt, if you listen, he's the greatest.

1:51:12.100 --> 1:51:14.340
 He'll have this poor guy on the phone for like hours.

1:51:14.340 --> 1:51:17.780
 Like the second you'll walk in to see my father, my kids,

1:51:17.780 --> 1:51:20.220
 hey, do me a favor, you fucking straighten out this pad.

1:51:20.220 --> 1:51:23.820
 And it's comical because I'm looking at my dad

1:51:23.820 --> 1:51:28.380
 and I'm going, he was born when Hitler started World War II.

1:51:28.380 --> 1:51:29.220
 Yeah, wow.

1:51:29.220 --> 1:51:30.500
 And I'm going, he's seen all of that.

1:51:30.500 --> 1:51:34.460
 Oh, my wife's grandmother was born in 1900 in Czechoslovakia

1:51:34.460 --> 1:51:35.900
 and she died in 1998.

1:51:35.900 --> 1:51:40.340
 I'm going, holy, the stuff she saw in the span of her life,

1:51:40.340 --> 1:51:42.100
 just, it's just incredible.

1:51:42.100 --> 1:51:45.100
 But what troubles me sometimes is with all of these advances

1:51:45.100 --> 1:51:47.700
 and all these devices, this is what I say to my kids,

1:51:49.860 --> 1:51:54.700
 look up from the phone and look up, right?

1:51:54.700 --> 1:51:56.780
 Because we don't talk anymore.

1:51:56.780 --> 1:52:01.500
 I saw a girl literally, and I shouldn't say girl, guy,

1:52:01.500 --> 1:52:04.380
 whatever, I saw a person literally just about walking

1:52:04.380 --> 1:52:06.140
 to an open manhole cover texting.

1:52:07.100 --> 1:52:08.700
 And I'm going, that's scary

1:52:08.700 --> 1:52:11.940
 because your awareness is gone.

1:52:11.940 --> 1:52:16.620
 And it's, I've been at restaurants, groups of people

1:52:16.620 --> 1:52:18.860
 and they're texting, they're texting each other

1:52:18.860 --> 1:52:20.260
 just sitting on the other side of the table.

1:52:20.260 --> 1:52:22.300
 I'm like, put the freaking thing down

1:52:22.300 --> 1:52:23.580
 and have a conversation.

1:52:23.580 --> 1:52:26.140
 And that's the thing, we've lost the art of conversation.

1:52:26.140 --> 1:52:30.140
 You know, like, my wife runs, she has this running joke.

1:52:30.140 --> 1:52:31.860
 She goes, there's a lot going on up there.

1:52:31.860 --> 1:52:34.300
 And I'm like, yeah, because I really, I'm inquisitive.

1:52:34.300 --> 1:52:35.580
 I'm excited about life.

1:52:35.580 --> 1:52:36.460
 I love to meet people.

1:52:36.460 --> 1:52:37.300
 I love to learn.

1:52:37.300 --> 1:52:38.940
 I love, and the only way you can do that

1:52:38.940 --> 1:52:40.420
 is to have a conversation.

1:52:40.420 --> 1:52:41.580
 The hilarious thing about this,

1:52:41.580 --> 1:52:43.620
 so you're obviously very charismatic.

1:52:43.620 --> 1:52:44.660
 You got great stories.

1:52:44.660 --> 1:52:45.900
 You're a great human being.

1:52:45.900 --> 1:52:46.740
 Thank you.

1:52:46.740 --> 1:52:48.300
 And you're talking to a guy who spent most of his life

1:52:48.300 --> 1:52:50.060
 behind a computer hiding from people.

1:52:50.060 --> 1:52:50.900
 No, no, and I don't.

1:52:50.900 --> 1:52:52.580
 But we're like trying to bridge this.

1:52:52.580 --> 1:52:53.860
 Right, but I don't mean that as a rip,

1:52:53.860 --> 1:52:55.540
 but you, I would never know that.

1:52:55.540 --> 1:52:57.500
 I would never know that because you're very engaging.

1:52:57.500 --> 1:52:59.260
 You're very, like, I would not know,

1:52:59.260 --> 1:53:02.020
 like you don't have any impediments

1:53:02.020 --> 1:53:06.140
 to your social skills, your personal, and that's,

1:53:06.140 --> 1:53:08.100
 and again, I don't mean it as a knock to you

1:53:08.100 --> 1:53:08.940
 and these young people.

1:53:08.940 --> 1:53:10.300
 Well, no, but this is me trying to look up

1:53:10.300 --> 1:53:12.740
 from a smartphone is having these conversations,

1:53:12.740 --> 1:53:13.700
 talking to people.

1:53:13.700 --> 1:53:15.020
 I think it's important.

1:53:15.020 --> 1:53:18.380
 I mean, some of it could be, it's always hard to know.

1:53:18.380 --> 1:53:22.860
 Some of it could be just you and I being old school,

1:53:22.860 --> 1:53:25.020
 because you grew up before the internet.

1:53:25.020 --> 1:53:27.340
 Maybe there is joy and deep human connection

1:53:27.340 --> 1:53:29.580
 to be discovered inside the smartphone.

1:53:29.580 --> 1:53:31.620
 We don't, it doesn't seem that way,

1:53:31.620 --> 1:53:33.540
 because the smartphone's so new,

1:53:33.540 --> 1:53:37.260
 maybe we just haven't figured out those things,

1:53:37.260 --> 1:53:39.060
 because there's a globalizing aspect.

1:53:39.060 --> 1:53:42.060
 There's a opportunity for you to connect with people

1:53:42.060 --> 1:53:44.940
 from across the world in ways that.

1:53:44.940 --> 1:53:46.580
 I have cousins in Ireland and England.

1:53:46.580 --> 1:53:47.420
 I love it.

1:53:47.420 --> 1:53:50.860
 I get a FaceTime or a WhatsApp and it's like, holy crap,

1:53:50.860 --> 1:53:53.020
 they're, you know, three, 4,000 miles away

1:53:53.020 --> 1:53:54.900
 and I'm having a conversation now.

1:53:54.900 --> 1:53:58.020
 I used to send my grandma in Ireland a letter.

1:53:58.020 --> 1:53:58.860
 I adored her.

1:53:58.860 --> 1:54:01.620
 She passed when I was 10.

1:54:01.620 --> 1:54:03.500
 And, no, I'm sorry, I was 11.

1:54:03.500 --> 1:54:07.140
 And I sent her a letter, airmailed,

1:54:07.140 --> 1:54:11.300
 and I'd wait and I'd wait, and about two weeks later,

1:54:11.300 --> 1:54:13.900
 this airmail letter would come back

1:54:13.900 --> 1:54:16.740
 and she'd call me Master Nils William Jorgensen.

1:54:16.740 --> 1:54:18.940
 I would be so excited, open that bad letter.

1:54:18.940 --> 1:54:21.260
 Handwritten, just like. Yeah, and like,

1:54:21.260 --> 1:54:22.900
 and then I'd write her another one

1:54:22.900 --> 1:54:25.980
 and I just couldn't wait for letters from granny.

1:54:25.980 --> 1:54:30.460
 And now it's like, you know, that's kind of faded away.

1:54:30.460 --> 1:54:32.540
 Yeah, I still write letters, by the way, handwritten.

1:54:32.540 --> 1:54:33.820
 I do too.

1:54:33.820 --> 1:54:38.500
 The way this all came about was I wrote a letter

1:54:38.500 --> 1:54:41.220
 to someone to say thank you for cancer research.

1:54:42.540 --> 1:54:44.060
 I'm blessed to be alive.

1:54:44.060 --> 1:54:45.220
 My cancer, right?

1:54:45.220 --> 1:54:47.020
 That's a good starting point for any story.

1:54:47.020 --> 1:54:47.940
 I'm blessed to be alive.

1:54:47.940 --> 1:54:51.260
 And my cancer was one that if I got it 15 years prior

1:54:51.260 --> 1:54:55.740
 to 19, excuse me, 2011, I was a dead man, right?

1:54:55.740 --> 1:54:58.220
 15, 20 years before there was no drug to treat.

1:54:58.220 --> 1:55:00.380
 I was gone, going home to see him.

1:55:01.420 --> 1:55:03.580
 So there's this wonderful gentleman

1:55:03.580 --> 1:55:06.100
 that donated hundreds of millions of dollars

1:55:06.100 --> 1:55:09.220
 to cancer research, Mr. David Koch.

1:55:09.220 --> 1:55:12.100
 He's since, God rest his soul, passed away.

1:55:12.100 --> 1:55:14.780
 And he's a controversial guy, big time business titan.

1:55:15.700 --> 1:55:17.580
 And, you know, there was,

1:55:17.580 --> 1:55:20.060
 the press was just brutalizing him one day

1:55:20.060 --> 1:55:22.500
 over something to do with his politics.

1:55:22.500 --> 1:55:26.700
 Now, I'm a union guy, proudly served in unions,

1:55:26.700 --> 1:55:27.860
 still in a union, you know?

1:55:27.860 --> 1:55:29.860
 And he was not, you know,

1:55:29.860 --> 1:55:32.300
 most business guys don't like unions, right?

1:55:32.300 --> 1:55:34.660
 But, you know, most guys like me don't like working

1:55:34.660 --> 1:55:38.300
 for $3 an hour, so we like our unions, right?

1:55:38.300 --> 1:55:40.860
 And I reached out across the table, so to speak,

1:55:40.860 --> 1:55:43.900
 and I sent him a handwritten letter to thank him,

1:55:43.900 --> 1:55:46.140
 to say, we may not agree on everything,

1:55:46.140 --> 1:55:47.300
 but I can't thank you enough.

1:55:47.300 --> 1:55:49.340
 There's just this regular dude out there

1:55:49.340 --> 1:55:52.340
 who is now living his life, watching his kids grow.

1:55:52.340 --> 1:55:54.300
 Thanks to generous people like you

1:55:54.300 --> 1:55:57.060
 who believe enough in cancer research, you've saved my life.

1:55:57.060 --> 1:56:00.340
 Maybe, I can't say his exact dollars, but people like him.

1:56:01.500 --> 1:56:04.260
 And he reached back out and his secretary said,

1:56:04.260 --> 1:56:05.380
 oh, he'd like to talk to you on the phone.

1:56:05.380 --> 1:56:07.020
 I go, well, he's kind of a busy guy,

1:56:07.020 --> 1:56:08.420
 he wants to talk to me, he's a billionaire.

1:56:08.420 --> 1:56:09.300
 And he got on the phone,

1:56:09.300 --> 1:56:11.220
 he was like the greatest guy in the world.

1:56:11.220 --> 1:56:12.580
 Invited me up to Sloan Kettering

1:56:12.580 --> 1:56:14.980
 to dedicate a new cancer wing.

1:56:14.980 --> 1:56:17.380
 It was like I was hanging out with my dad.

1:56:17.380 --> 1:56:22.340
 And the sweetest man, just so kind, so empathy,

1:56:22.340 --> 1:56:23.940
 because he was a cancer survivor.

1:56:23.940 --> 1:56:28.300
 But now he's got the means to help people

1:56:28.300 --> 1:56:32.660
 who've suffered his fate to a better place.

1:56:32.660 --> 1:56:35.460
 And he was so real and it was so beautiful

1:56:35.460 --> 1:56:37.100
 just to get to know, say, hey, you know what?

1:56:37.100 --> 1:56:39.420
 This guy is a big time guy,

1:56:39.420 --> 1:56:42.860
 but yeah, he's just a regular human like you and I.

1:56:42.860 --> 1:56:45.860
 I'm a guy who went to night college and I went to the army

1:56:45.860 --> 1:56:47.700
 and I'm a blue collar kind of dude.

1:56:47.700 --> 1:56:49.860
 And here's this guy who went to MIT, like you,

1:56:49.860 --> 1:56:53.860
 and he's a wildly successful billionaire, a genius.

1:56:53.860 --> 1:56:58.300
 But yet he can sit down and mix it up with me

1:56:58.300 --> 1:56:59.980
 and know that I was truly grateful.

1:56:59.980 --> 1:57:02.340
 And that to me was just like one of the coolest

1:57:03.260 --> 1:57:05.220
 little relationships I've ever had.

1:57:05.220 --> 1:57:06.300
 It wasn't like we were hanging out,

1:57:06.300 --> 1:57:08.260
 having barbecues together, but like, you know,

1:57:08.260 --> 1:57:11.580
 it was just, I was so touched by his decency.

1:57:11.580 --> 1:57:16.580
 Well, the basics of the, like cancer reveals, you know,

1:57:16.700 --> 1:57:18.660
 it's like fundamental to the human experience.

1:57:18.660 --> 1:57:20.900
 It's trauma, it's tragedy.

1:57:20.900 --> 1:57:22.860
 It's like money, who gives a shit about money?

1:57:22.860 --> 1:57:27.140
 Education, all of that is like weird new inventions.

1:57:27.140 --> 1:57:29.380
 You know, life is short.

1:57:29.380 --> 1:57:31.340
 You suffer with the various diseases.

1:57:31.340 --> 1:57:34.140
 And that is a reminder that life is short

1:57:34.140 --> 1:57:36.220
 and a reminder of the basic human connection.

1:57:36.220 --> 1:57:38.380
 And that's why you can bridge that gap.

1:57:38.380 --> 1:57:39.220
 Oh yeah.

1:57:39.220 --> 1:57:40.460
 All sparked by a handwritten letter,

1:57:40.460 --> 1:57:42.780
 which just makes for a hell of a story.

1:57:42.780 --> 1:57:43.620
 And you know what, Lex?

1:57:43.620 --> 1:57:45.940
 This is the commonality between us.

1:57:45.940 --> 1:57:48.540
 A guy with three jobs to a billionaire.

1:57:48.540 --> 1:57:51.820
 We both had that sense of a sledgehammer to the chest.

1:57:51.820 --> 1:57:55.540
 Boom, you have cancer and you can't breathe

1:57:55.540 --> 1:57:56.820
 for like 30 seconds.

1:57:58.380 --> 1:58:00.260
 And then when your heart's just about to kick off

1:58:00.260 --> 1:58:02.740
 and you take a breath and you go, I'm sorry,

1:58:02.740 --> 1:58:04.180
 what'd you say, doc?

1:58:04.180 --> 1:58:06.020
 You have cancer.

1:58:06.020 --> 1:58:08.380
 And it don't matter what kind.

1:58:08.380 --> 1:58:11.380
 One of my best buddies, Bobby's going through right now,

1:58:11.380 --> 1:58:14.340
 a prostate, and I got way too many of my buddies

1:58:14.340 --> 1:58:15.740
 with cancer, right?

1:58:15.740 --> 1:58:18.580
 My buddy, Hugh, who became a vet since his first cancer,

1:58:18.580 --> 1:58:20.500
 he was a fireman, he's now a veterinarian, right?

1:58:20.500 --> 1:58:23.100
 He diagnosed me actually over the phone, by the way.

1:58:24.460 --> 1:58:25.940
 When they couldn't figure out what was wrong with me.

1:58:25.940 --> 1:58:29.060
 Well, Dr. Hugh, he nailed it to the T.

1:58:30.100 --> 1:58:31.100
 And we talk.

1:58:32.340 --> 1:58:34.980
 And the same thing that the dozen of my close friends

1:58:34.980 --> 1:58:39.820
 that have cancer, the same thing we say is the fear.

1:58:39.820 --> 1:58:43.340
 So Mr. Koch and I, we shared that same sledgehammer

1:58:43.340 --> 1:58:46.020
 to the chest and that same fear.

1:58:46.020 --> 1:58:47.940
 And it didn't matter how much money he had

1:58:47.940 --> 1:58:49.460
 and how much I didn't.

1:58:49.460 --> 1:58:52.180
 And you know, it's just like the morning of the trade center.

1:58:52.180 --> 1:58:57.180
 There was big time brokers who went to their demise, right?

1:58:57.460 --> 1:58:59.740
 Working in these firms, God rest them.

1:58:59.740 --> 1:59:01.500
 And there was dishwashers, excuse me,

1:59:01.500 --> 1:59:04.740
 dishwashers up on the windows on the world restaurant

1:59:04.740 --> 1:59:08.900
 on the 107th floor, making five bucks an hour.

1:59:08.900 --> 1:59:10.460
 And they died together, it didn't matter.

1:59:10.460 --> 1:59:12.340
 It didn't matter if you had an armored car

1:59:12.340 --> 1:59:15.300
 loaded with bills, you were done that day.

1:59:15.300 --> 1:59:17.460
 And that's, I think where people need

1:59:17.460 --> 1:59:19.500
 to humanize each other.

1:59:19.500 --> 1:59:21.980
 Just because you drive around in a nice car

1:59:21.980 --> 1:59:25.500
 and you got your own jet and you got this and you got that,

1:59:25.500 --> 1:59:26.500
 don't mean nothing.

1:59:26.500 --> 1:59:29.500
 When you're going, when you're in that vulnerable spot,

1:59:29.500 --> 1:59:34.460
 you could have more money than the US reserves.

1:59:34.460 --> 1:59:38.900
 Federal reserve, or you could have a welfare check.

1:59:38.900 --> 1:59:40.180
 You're going.

1:59:40.180 --> 1:59:41.580
 I learned that in a cancer ward.

1:59:41.580 --> 1:59:44.020
 I had people in my ward that died on me.

1:59:45.140 --> 1:59:47.740
 I was going around as a little bit of an ambassador

1:59:47.740 --> 1:59:50.540
 because I was trying to, I was putting on a fake,

1:59:50.540 --> 1:59:53.340
 I was putting on a fake like I got this, I got this.

1:59:53.340 --> 1:59:54.860
 I was so scared.

1:59:54.860 --> 1:59:58.860
 But when I got past that seven days of torture

2:00:00.060 --> 2:00:01.820
 and the days leading up to it,

2:00:01.820 --> 2:00:05.540
 I'd go around and try to comfort the other cancer patients.

2:00:05.540 --> 2:00:07.780
 I had this one older African American gentleman,

2:00:07.780 --> 2:00:08.820
 he couldn't talk because he had

2:00:08.820 --> 2:00:10.860
 such advanced throat cancer.

2:00:10.860 --> 2:00:12.500
 He was my roommate for a little while,

2:00:12.500 --> 2:00:15.300
 but then he got worse so they had to put him by himself.

2:00:16.860 --> 2:00:18.340
 And you couldn't understand what he was saying

2:00:18.340 --> 2:00:22.220
 because his throat was just so radiated from the radiation.

2:00:22.220 --> 2:00:25.780
 But if you put your ear down to him,

2:00:25.780 --> 2:00:27.620
 you could make out what he was saying.

2:00:28.740 --> 2:00:30.140
 And I'm not faulting the nurses

2:00:30.140 --> 2:00:31.740
 for maybe not wanting to do that, right?

2:00:31.740 --> 2:00:34.300
 They're busy, they got a ton going on,

2:00:34.300 --> 2:00:36.020
 they can't spend, you know.

2:00:36.020 --> 2:00:39.700
 So if he was in need, I'd put my ear down

2:00:39.700 --> 2:00:42.780
 and I'd find out and I'd go get it for him.

2:00:42.780 --> 2:00:45.140
 So when they moved me down the hall,

2:00:47.900 --> 2:00:50.380
 they asked me to come down with my IV tower.

2:00:50.380 --> 2:00:51.340
 He needed me.

2:00:52.780 --> 2:00:57.780
 And I knew it was bad because he just, his look was gone.

2:00:57.780 --> 2:00:59.700
 And I said, sir, what do you need?

2:01:01.700 --> 2:01:04.780
 And he whispered, call my sister, I'm going.

2:01:06.180 --> 2:01:09.460
 He had only one survivor in his whole life.

2:01:09.460 --> 2:01:11.620
 And she was in North Carolina and he wanted her to know

2:01:11.620 --> 2:01:13.500
 she couldn't get up, she was elderly.

2:01:14.780 --> 2:01:18.220
 And I got the nurse and I got on the phone

2:01:18.220 --> 2:01:20.500
 and I called his sister and I said, ma'm,

2:01:20.500 --> 2:01:22.100
 I explained who I was.

2:01:23.380 --> 2:01:26.380
 And I said, he can't really talk.

2:01:26.380 --> 2:01:29.940
 He can't really verbalize too well right now,

2:01:29.940 --> 2:01:31.860
 but he wants to say he loves you.

2:01:38.260 --> 2:01:42.180
 And I put the phone down and he told her he loved her

2:01:42.180 --> 2:01:43.740
 and he said, I'm going home.

2:01:46.460 --> 2:01:47.380
 And that was it.

2:01:47.380 --> 2:01:50.700
 And I hung the phone up and I said, ma'm, I'm so sorry.

2:01:50.700 --> 2:01:52.500
 I said, you know, they'll notify you.

2:01:53.700 --> 2:01:55.620
 And I stayed with him for a while holding his hand

2:01:55.620 --> 2:01:57.740
 and then, you know, they wanted him to rest.

2:01:57.740 --> 2:02:01.940
 And then I left and then I got the tap an hour later

2:02:01.940 --> 2:02:03.700
 and they said, I'm sorry, he's gone.

2:02:05.580 --> 2:02:09.500
 And then there was another girl and she was a young girl

2:02:09.500 --> 2:02:13.260
 from one of the areas I work, young African American girl

2:02:13.260 --> 2:02:14.820
 where I used to respond and I didn't know her,

2:02:14.820 --> 2:02:15.900
 but I knew her neighborhood.

2:02:15.900 --> 2:02:20.700
 And she had what I had, but they weren't sure which one.

2:02:20.700 --> 2:02:22.940
 You know, leukemias, they're an elusive beast.

2:02:22.940 --> 2:02:24.340
 There's 49 of them, right?

2:02:24.340 --> 2:02:25.740
 And each one of them is like,

2:02:26.740 --> 2:02:28.900
 they got their own little nuances,

2:02:28.900 --> 2:02:30.260
 own specific treatments.

2:02:30.260 --> 2:02:31.620
 So if they don't know what you have,

2:02:31.620 --> 2:02:34.020
 they don't know what to do for you.

2:02:34.020 --> 2:02:35.940
 And she refused to let him drill into her hip

2:02:35.940 --> 2:02:37.740
 to take the marrow because it's vicious.

2:02:37.740 --> 2:02:38.700
 It hurts so much.

2:02:38.700 --> 2:02:41.620
 It's like someone born into your hip with a wood drill

2:02:41.620 --> 2:02:43.900
 and it's no joke.

2:02:45.820 --> 2:02:48.500
 And they asked me to try to convince her

2:02:48.500 --> 2:02:52.220
 to let them do that or she was gonna die.

2:02:52.220 --> 2:02:54.900
 Cause if they couldn't figure it out, it was advancing quickly.

2:02:54.900 --> 2:02:59.340
 She was, so I talked to her and she said,

2:02:59.340 --> 2:03:01.140
 I can't, I can't, I'm too scared.

2:03:02.060 --> 2:03:03.740
 I said, but are you more scared to die?

2:03:03.740 --> 2:03:04.940
 And she said, I am.

2:03:04.940 --> 2:03:07.300
 I said, okay, I'll stay with you.

2:03:07.300 --> 2:03:08.340
 I'll hold your hand.

2:03:08.340 --> 2:03:10.660
 You squeeze it as hard as you want.

2:03:10.660 --> 2:03:13.380
 I said, if you want, they'll give you like a towel

2:03:13.380 --> 2:03:14.580
 or something to bite on, whatever.

2:03:14.580 --> 2:03:16.580
 I said, but you get that pain out,

2:03:16.580 --> 2:03:19.940
 but you need to do this so you can get saved.

2:03:19.940 --> 2:03:22.700
 And she said, okay.

2:03:22.700 --> 2:03:25.260
 And they came in and they, this huge thick needle,

2:03:25.260 --> 2:03:27.100
 they just bore it into you.

2:03:27.100 --> 2:03:29.020
 And she's screaming for her life

2:03:29.020 --> 2:03:32.380
 and she's squeezing my fingers so hard and so hard.

2:03:32.380 --> 2:03:33.420
 And I said, that's okay, hon.

2:03:33.420 --> 2:03:34.820
 You keep going, you keep going.

2:03:34.820 --> 2:03:35.660
 We got it.

2:03:35.660 --> 2:03:37.540
 It's just 10 more seconds, 10 more seconds.

2:03:38.620 --> 2:03:39.980
 They got it.

2:03:39.980 --> 2:03:41.420
 They figured out her treatment

2:03:42.300 --> 2:03:44.380
 and they got her onto her road to recovery.

2:03:44.380 --> 2:03:49.380
 And then I spent a long time asking God, why do I have cancer?

2:03:55.500 --> 2:03:57.460
 Then I stopped and I went, wait a minute.

2:03:57.460 --> 2:03:59.820
 I didn't die that day with my friends.

2:04:02.060 --> 2:04:04.500
 Shame on me for asking them why I have cancer.

2:04:04.500 --> 2:04:08.940
 I had 10 years after 9 11 with such great ears.

2:04:08.940 --> 2:04:13.940
 And I got to watch my little girl being born

2:04:14.820 --> 2:04:16.980
 when John never got to see his son.

2:04:16.980 --> 2:04:19.060
 So it was all gravy after that.

2:04:20.140 --> 2:04:23.100
 And I said, but now I know why I have my cancer

2:04:23.100 --> 2:04:27.020
 because I can empathize with people who have it.

2:04:27.860 --> 2:04:31.500
 And I can try to be their voice when they can't talk,

2:04:32.500 --> 2:04:35.660
 be their shield to try to take that pain

2:04:35.660 --> 2:04:38.820
 because I can understand, I can walk their walk.

2:04:41.500 --> 2:04:43.220
 And now I thank God for my cancer

2:04:44.100 --> 2:04:45.940
 because it's made me a better human being.

2:04:45.940 --> 2:04:47.780
 It's made me, I'm not gonna lie,

2:04:47.780 --> 2:04:49.340
 it brought a lot of anger for a while

2:04:49.340 --> 2:04:52.260
 and my family suffered it,

2:04:52.260 --> 2:04:55.980
 but I really tried to go past that and heal

2:04:55.980 --> 2:04:57.940
 and part of living out in the country.

2:04:57.940 --> 2:05:00.980
 It's very, very healing for the mind and the soul.

2:05:00.980 --> 2:05:04.700
 But I now thank God for the cancer

2:05:04.700 --> 2:05:06.300
 because it humbled me.

2:05:06.300 --> 2:05:07.460
 I didn't really need humbling.

2:05:07.460 --> 2:05:11.380
 I wasn't an arrogant puffed up type of person at all,

2:05:11.380 --> 2:05:15.180
 but maybe I was running away at myself a little bit

2:05:15.180 --> 2:05:17.500
 and working on a TV show, I'm fine, man.

2:05:17.500 --> 2:05:20.940
 30 at the time, well, I was 42, I got sick.

2:05:20.940 --> 2:05:22.780
 Life was cruising, man, it was great.

2:05:23.660 --> 2:05:26.740
 And then all of a sudden it was like a blow out

2:05:26.740 --> 2:05:28.260
 on the highway in the middle of the night

2:05:28.260 --> 2:05:30.820
 and you were just veering off towards the guardrail.

2:05:30.820 --> 2:05:35.140
 Yeah, you remembered, you're reminded that you're mortal

2:05:35.140 --> 2:05:39.300
 and that's ultimately a connection to all the rest of us.

2:05:39.300 --> 2:05:41.780
 Oh yeah, it's a good thing though,

2:05:41.780 --> 2:05:42.900
 because that's the problem, I think.

2:05:42.900 --> 2:05:44.140
 There's a lot of people running around

2:05:44.140 --> 2:05:46.260
 and thinking they're immortal, right?

2:05:46.260 --> 2:05:47.460
 You know, when you look at it, Lex, right?

2:05:47.460 --> 2:05:51.380
 You look at the heartache in a lot of segments of people

2:05:51.380 --> 2:05:54.740
 and anytime like someone that's got fame and wealth

2:05:54.740 --> 2:05:58.580
 and success and they die tragically,

2:05:58.580 --> 2:06:01.300
 a lot of times it's from a substance abuse

2:06:01.300 --> 2:06:04.820
 or just some horrible death.

2:06:05.780 --> 2:06:07.580
 And I used to say to myself,

2:06:07.580 --> 2:06:10.180
 how the hell would someone with that much money

2:06:10.180 --> 2:06:12.300
 and that much fame and this freaking mansion

2:06:12.300 --> 2:06:16.380
 and I love cars, my son and I are just big car heads,

2:06:16.380 --> 2:06:19.420
 you know, I'm like, you know, this guy's got a collection

2:06:19.420 --> 2:06:23.700
 of cars and he overdosed because he was sad.

2:06:23.700 --> 2:06:25.860
 And I'm going, how the frig are you sad?

2:06:25.860 --> 2:06:28.900
 But then I stop and I go, okay,

2:06:28.900 --> 2:06:31.740
 because maybe he doesn't have any idea who loves him.

2:06:31.740 --> 2:06:33.700
 He's got a lot of people clinging onto him

2:06:33.700 --> 2:06:35.380
 because of his success.

2:06:35.380 --> 2:06:40.020
 And he just, he can't fill that void, you know?

2:06:40.020 --> 2:06:42.700
 And then they fill the void with something destructive.

2:06:42.700 --> 2:06:46.860
 And I'm not bashing people that have substance abuse

2:06:46.860 --> 2:06:49.340
 problems or alcohol problems, I don't mean it that way.

2:06:49.340 --> 2:06:54.340
 But what I mean is it's just sad that their level

2:06:54.340 --> 2:06:57.660
 of despair is so high, on the surface,

2:06:57.660 --> 2:06:59.860
 they look like they just got everything going on.

2:06:59.860 --> 2:07:00.700
 It's all great, right?

2:07:00.700 --> 2:07:02.860
 They're still human, still got to deal with the same.

2:07:02.860 --> 2:07:05.500
 Yeah, exactly, because they want love, right?

2:07:05.500 --> 2:07:10.500
 They want love and they can't really find it.

2:07:11.140 --> 2:07:12.700
 Well, first of all, that's true for all of us.

2:07:12.700 --> 2:07:14.700
 I think we're deeply lonely and looking for love

2:07:14.700 --> 2:07:16.820
 and when we find it, that's what friendship is.

2:07:16.820 --> 2:07:17.780
 Absolutely.

2:07:17.780 --> 2:07:21.060
 And then that's true for whether you're super rich

2:07:21.060 --> 2:07:23.980
 or super poor, it's all the same journey.

2:07:23.980 --> 2:07:26.540
 My dad said all the time, kid, you're gonna end up

2:07:26.540 --> 2:07:30.060
 working with hundreds of guys and you'll love a lot of them

2:07:30.060 --> 2:07:32.220
 but he says when it's all said and done

2:07:32.220 --> 2:07:33.780
 and you're all like me and if you've still got

2:07:33.780 --> 2:07:36.500
 two or three of them that you talk to and you'll love.

2:07:36.500 --> 2:07:40.860
 And I tell you what, I mean, I have thanked the Lord

2:07:40.860 --> 2:07:43.420
 more than two or three of them and I have my six,

2:07:43.420 --> 2:07:45.580
 I call it my six, it's the six guys that are gonna

2:07:45.580 --> 2:07:47.820
 carry my coffin when I'm gone, right?

2:07:47.820 --> 2:07:50.340
 Because I know this cancer's gonna come back, I know it.

2:07:50.340 --> 2:07:51.940
 Like we get multiples, right?

2:07:51.940 --> 2:07:54.180
 My friend Yvette just got his second.

2:07:54.180 --> 2:07:56.180
 My friend Mike's had five of them.

2:07:56.180 --> 2:07:58.740
 My other Mike has two of them, yeah.

2:07:58.740 --> 2:08:03.740
 But I wasn't ready to accept it in 2011.

2:08:03.980 --> 2:08:06.260
 There was so much more to do and it was so much,

2:08:06.260 --> 2:08:08.780
 I was so scared, I'm like wow, who's gonna take care

2:08:08.780 --> 2:08:11.500
 of my kids and who, you know, they were little.

2:08:11.500 --> 2:08:13.460
 Nine, 11 and 14, right?

2:08:13.460 --> 2:08:15.780
 It's like what the hell, I have two girls and a boy

2:08:15.780 --> 2:08:17.220
 in between and they're beautiful kids.

2:08:17.220 --> 2:08:20.060
 They're such good, good children, adults now.

2:08:20.060 --> 2:08:23.460
 I mean, but you know, my wife's a drill sergeant,

2:08:23.460 --> 2:08:26.620
 she's tough, she don't mess, you know, she's this big.

2:08:26.620 --> 2:08:28.820
 So you're the softy in the family, I'm just kidding.

2:08:28.820 --> 2:08:32.220
 Well, you know, it's funny because my son said to me,

2:08:32.220 --> 2:08:35.140
 my son's 21 now, he's a good kid, you know.

2:08:35.140 --> 2:08:38.620
 And he says to me, back when he was like 12,

2:08:38.620 --> 2:08:41.460
 he goes, dad, I don't want you to be offended

2:08:41.460 --> 2:08:42.740
 but I'm really scared of mom,

2:08:42.740 --> 2:08:44.220
 I'm not really that scared of you.

2:08:44.220 --> 2:08:46.540
 And you know, like I cracked up because it's true,

2:08:46.540 --> 2:08:49.500
 she's gotta stand on like a milk crate to reach him

2:08:49.500 --> 2:08:51.580
 because you know, she's tiny and he's tall,

2:08:51.580 --> 2:08:54.380
 but it's true, but you know, but she was hard but fair,

2:08:54.380 --> 2:08:56.900
 but loved, that's, see, this is the thing,

2:08:56.900 --> 2:09:01.900
 you take any child anywhere from any background,

2:09:03.700 --> 2:09:05.620
 if you love them, you nurture them,

2:09:05.620 --> 2:09:07.060
 you teach them and you guide them,

2:09:07.060 --> 2:09:09.380
 you have a successful adult.

2:09:09.380 --> 2:09:12.500
 And see, that's the problem in our society,

2:09:12.500 --> 2:09:15.180
 it's not judgmental, I'm not judging anyone,

2:09:15.180 --> 2:09:19.460
 but we need to try harder as parents

2:09:19.460 --> 2:09:22.060
 as siblings, as friends,

2:09:22.060 --> 2:09:26.260
 but especially when we're blessed with a child,

2:09:26.260 --> 2:09:29.900
 it's like, you gotta put that child first,

2:09:29.900 --> 2:09:32.500
 it's like being a military personal responder,

2:09:32.500 --> 2:09:35.780
 it's not about you anymore, now it's the team.

2:09:35.780 --> 2:09:39.180
 So that little child is now the team

2:09:39.180 --> 2:09:42.140
 and you know, your wife or your significant other,

2:09:42.140 --> 2:09:44.980
 you know, like it's not about you anymore.

2:09:44.980 --> 2:09:48.900
 And see, that's the problem is people have a hard time

2:09:48.900 --> 2:09:51.700
 not making it about them, you know,

2:09:51.700 --> 2:09:55.300
 like now it's really weird, my kids are 19, 21 and 24

2:09:55.300 --> 2:09:56.420
 and they hardly wanna hang with me

2:09:56.420 --> 2:09:59.700
 because they're busy in their life, we love each other,

2:09:59.700 --> 2:10:01.380
 they're probably tired of hearing me go on

2:10:01.380 --> 2:10:03.020
 and you know, preach and whatever,

2:10:03.020 --> 2:10:04.740
 but like, but they're adults,

2:10:04.740 --> 2:10:08.420
 we did pretty much the crux of what we had to do

2:10:08.420 --> 2:10:10.660
 to put them into adulthood.

2:10:11.620 --> 2:10:13.380
 And I look back and I go, wow,

2:10:13.380 --> 2:10:15.380
 I wish I didn't work so much and I wish,

2:10:15.380 --> 2:10:17.340
 but then I say, no, but it was okay,

2:10:17.340 --> 2:10:21.180
 my wife stayed home, good lessons, good, you know,

2:10:21.180 --> 2:10:22.020
 just like.

2:10:22.020 --> 2:10:24.700
 But ultimately, like you said, it's love.

2:10:24.700 --> 2:10:27.260
 It is, it's the common,

2:10:27.260 --> 2:10:31.460
 love is the most important ingredient on this earth

2:10:31.460 --> 2:10:34.780
 and that's the problem what's going on right now,

2:10:34.780 --> 2:10:37.620
 like take politics out of it, right?

2:10:37.620 --> 2:10:40.020
 Take polarizing each other against each other,

2:10:40.020 --> 2:10:41.980
 take all that crap out of it

2:10:41.980 --> 2:10:45.620
 and just airdrop a bunch of love, right?

2:10:45.620 --> 2:10:49.100
 Like when I worked on Rescuing Me, right?

2:10:49.100 --> 2:10:51.300
 I love those people so much, they were such great,

2:10:51.300 --> 2:10:53.300
 we had such a great crew and they worked so hard.

2:10:53.300 --> 2:10:54.180
 You're a celebrity.

2:10:54.180 --> 2:10:55.980
 No, no, no, not at all.

2:10:55.980 --> 2:10:58.860
 If I was, it didn't really work out so good.

2:10:58.860 --> 2:11:01.060
 I went on to be in the stagehand,

2:11:01.060 --> 2:11:04.780
 no, I'm not pretty, but they don't want old guys

2:11:04.780 --> 2:11:08.780
 waving bye bye hairdos, but it was funny,

2:11:08.780 --> 2:11:10.340
 the crew, we became really tight,

2:11:10.340 --> 2:11:14.860
 we had like, shoot, like 80, 90 people on a set, right?

2:11:14.860 --> 2:11:17.620
 And you know, the first few episodes,

2:11:17.620 --> 2:11:19.180
 everybody's trying to feel each other out

2:11:19.180 --> 2:11:20.560
 because you know, you work with different crews,

2:11:20.560 --> 2:11:24.220
 different people and this is going back,

2:11:24.220 --> 2:11:27.260
 starting in 2004, so it was a different time

2:11:27.260 --> 2:11:30.140
 and I love to hug people

2:11:30.140 --> 2:11:33.500
 because to me, a hug is a true expression

2:11:33.500 --> 2:11:35.540
 of love and caring.

2:11:35.540 --> 2:11:37.140
 You may not know a person a long time,

2:11:37.140 --> 2:11:38.820
 but you say, I care about you with a hug.

2:11:38.820 --> 2:11:41.140
 Can I add just a tiny tangent?

2:11:41.140 --> 2:11:44.860
 This was in the midst of COVID when I was in Boston

2:11:44.860 --> 2:11:49.300
 and it was, you know, masks, like triple masks, nobody.

2:11:49.300 --> 2:11:51.780
 And when I went to see Joe here

2:11:51.780 --> 2:11:53.260
 when he was trying to convince me to move to Austin,

2:11:53.260 --> 2:11:55.940
 Joe Rogan, and then the first time I see him,

2:11:55.940 --> 2:11:59.420
 he's like, ah, you motherfucking big ass hug.

2:11:59.420 --> 2:12:00.260
 And it felt so good.

2:12:00.260 --> 2:12:02.140
 But people probably looked horrified.

2:12:02.140 --> 2:12:02.980
 They're hugging.

2:12:02.980 --> 2:12:04.500
 It was just him.

2:12:04.500 --> 2:12:05.340
 Oh, okay, I know what I'm saying,

2:12:05.340 --> 2:12:06.500
 but if you do it in public now,

2:12:06.500 --> 2:12:07.820
 it's like you committed.

2:12:07.820 --> 2:12:10.140
 But that expression, because I was so,

2:12:10.140 --> 2:12:14.100
 you forget how powerful that is.

2:12:14.100 --> 2:12:15.340
 Oh, I got some of my buddies.

2:12:15.340 --> 2:12:19.620
 I give them a huge hug and a big sloppy kiss on their cheek

2:12:19.620 --> 2:12:21.260
 and I, cause I love them.

2:12:21.260 --> 2:12:23.140
 They, these are my brothers, you know?

2:12:23.140 --> 2:12:27.140
 But on this set, I swear to God, it got to the point

2:12:27.140 --> 2:12:28.100
 and I'm not trying to whatever,

2:12:28.100 --> 2:12:30.140
 but there was people that would come up to me

2:12:30.140 --> 2:12:31.740
 for the daily hug.

2:12:31.740 --> 2:12:33.940
 And I said, what are you doing?

2:12:33.940 --> 2:12:35.140
 And they said, come on, bring it in.

2:12:35.140 --> 2:12:37.140
 And I give them the hug and they said, you don't understand.

2:12:37.140 --> 2:12:39.140
 It just makes me feel so good.

2:12:39.140 --> 2:12:41.100
 It makes me feel like you give a crap about me.

2:12:41.100 --> 2:12:42.380
 I said, I really do.

2:12:42.380 --> 2:12:44.380
 I said, but it touched my heart

2:12:44.380 --> 2:12:46.500
 that people were seeking me out

2:12:46.500 --> 2:12:48.540
 to get that hug to start the day.

2:12:48.540 --> 2:12:50.060
 And I remember there was a guy in Manhattan,

2:12:50.060 --> 2:12:51.900
 he was selling hugs for like 50 cents

2:12:51.900 --> 2:12:53.020
 and I think he got arrested, right?

2:12:53.020 --> 2:12:54.340
 It was just before COVID.

2:12:54.340 --> 2:12:56.740
 But like, I wouldn't sell them if, but now.

2:12:56.740 --> 2:12:57.580
 You've given them away for free.

2:12:57.580 --> 2:12:58.420
 Well, now I got leukemia.

2:12:58.420 --> 2:13:00.100
 I'd be kind of concerned to get into COVID.

2:13:00.100 --> 2:13:03.540
 I mean, but like, I really think we need that.

2:13:03.540 --> 2:13:06.500
 We need hugging booths, like in each city or each town.

2:13:06.500 --> 2:13:08.860
 Like, because there's so many people

2:13:08.860 --> 2:13:11.420
 that just want to know someone gives a shit about them.

2:13:11.420 --> 2:13:12.260
 And that's the problem.

2:13:12.260 --> 2:13:14.660
 It's like, like, you know,

2:13:14.660 --> 2:13:17.220
 that's what I love about small little towns

2:13:17.220 --> 2:13:19.620
 like where I am now in Tennessee.

2:13:19.620 --> 2:13:20.940
 And I'm not knocking New York.

2:13:20.940 --> 2:13:21.900
 I'm not knocking big towns,

2:13:21.900 --> 2:13:23.900
 but I guess it's easier to do in a smaller area

2:13:23.900 --> 2:13:26.940
 because it's just not this mass of humanity.

2:13:26.940 --> 2:13:29.020
 But they'll stop and check on you.

2:13:29.020 --> 2:13:30.620
 Like you're out in the road and you know,

2:13:30.620 --> 2:13:32.660
 like I'm cutting and cleaning or whatever.

2:13:32.660 --> 2:13:34.740
 Occasionally I'll roll a lawnmower or a tractor

2:13:34.740 --> 2:13:37.540
 into a ditch cause I'm not a farmer, too good.

2:13:37.540 --> 2:13:40.780
 But it's easier to drive a fire truck in New York.

2:13:40.780 --> 2:13:42.940
 But they literally, oh, I was worried.

2:13:42.940 --> 2:13:43.780
 I haven't seen you.

2:13:43.780 --> 2:13:45.100
 And I'm like, no, no, I'm okay.

2:13:45.100 --> 2:13:46.860
 But they literally like check on you.

2:13:46.860 --> 2:13:47.860
 They're worried about you.

2:13:47.860 --> 2:13:50.420
 And I'm going, these people hardly know me,

2:13:50.420 --> 2:13:52.940
 but yet they're so caring.

2:13:52.940 --> 2:13:54.540
 And that's the problem.

2:13:54.540 --> 2:13:57.980
 Like this is what I love about my life.

2:13:57.980 --> 2:14:00.460
 I spent a lot of time as, especially as a young boy

2:14:00.460 --> 2:14:04.700
 and a lot of time in Ireland at my grandma's farm.

2:14:04.700 --> 2:14:08.220
 And my mom comes from this tiny, tiny little village.

2:14:08.220 --> 2:14:09.700
 She's out in the middle of nowhere.

2:14:09.700 --> 2:14:12.700
 And the childhood home she grew up in still,

2:14:12.700 --> 2:14:15.260
 my aunt and uncle live in it still.

2:14:15.260 --> 2:14:16.660
 I just love it there so much.

2:14:16.660 --> 2:14:17.700
 Cause everyone waves.

2:14:17.700 --> 2:14:19.300
 Tennessee's similar.

2:14:19.300 --> 2:14:21.140
 They wave, driving by and you're like,

2:14:21.140 --> 2:14:21.980
 who the hell's that?

2:14:21.980 --> 2:14:23.060
 I just wave, you know.

2:14:23.060 --> 2:14:24.260
 But my cousin will point it out.

2:14:24.260 --> 2:14:27.020
 Actually third cousin, second removed by, you know, Johnny.

2:14:27.020 --> 2:14:29.860
 Like, holy shoot, I'm related to everyone here, right?

2:14:29.860 --> 2:14:34.020
 But like everyone stops to say hello and how are you?

2:14:34.020 --> 2:14:36.700
 And I have a problem doing that because my wife goes,

2:14:36.700 --> 2:14:37.780
 people think you're crazy.

2:14:37.780 --> 2:14:38.940
 Why are you talking to everybody?

2:14:38.940 --> 2:14:42.180
 I said, like, I'll literally stop someone and say,

2:14:42.180 --> 2:14:43.020
 how's your day going?

2:14:43.020 --> 2:14:45.020
 Like, I mean, I'll randomly on the sidewalk.

2:14:45.020 --> 2:14:45.900
 Then it looks a little nuts.

2:14:45.900 --> 2:14:48.220
 But like, if I'm buying a cup of coffee.

2:14:48.220 --> 2:14:50.180
 Oh, that happens here in Austin all the time.

2:14:50.180 --> 2:14:53.220
 That's why I love it here on the sidewalk randomly.

2:14:53.220 --> 2:14:54.780
 Yeah, no, it's just so nice.

2:14:54.780 --> 2:14:55.820
 They'll say hi to me.

2:14:55.820 --> 2:14:57.300
 I thought they recognized me or something.

2:14:57.300 --> 2:14:58.420
 I don't give a shit who you are.

2:14:58.420 --> 2:14:59.660
 They're just being nice.

2:14:59.660 --> 2:15:03.180
 I was on the road coming back,

2:15:03.180 --> 2:15:07.020
 driving from my family up north down to Tennessee last week.

2:15:08.420 --> 2:15:13.300
 I stopped in a bathroom and it was closed.

2:15:13.300 --> 2:15:15.300
 The girl was cleaning it, whatever.

2:15:15.300 --> 2:15:16.700
 She's working so hard, whatever.

2:15:16.700 --> 2:15:17.540
 And she goes, sir, she goes,

2:15:17.540 --> 2:15:19.260
 if you go down the hall, there's a family restroom.

2:15:19.260 --> 2:15:20.180
 Feel free to use it.

2:15:20.180 --> 2:15:22.260
 You know, she didn't have to do that.

2:15:22.260 --> 2:15:24.020
 And I went down and I'm old.

2:15:24.020 --> 2:15:27.380
 You need a bathroom, you need a bathroom, right?

2:15:27.380 --> 2:15:30.740
 And I walked back out and I said, ma'm,

2:15:30.740 --> 2:15:32.220
 I said, I want to thank you for being here today.

2:15:32.220 --> 2:15:33.900
 I says, the bathroom was immaculate.

2:15:33.900 --> 2:15:37.100
 It was, it was like my army bathroom in the barracks.

2:15:37.100 --> 2:15:39.700
 It was spotless, right?

2:15:39.700 --> 2:15:41.260
 And I gave her $10.

2:15:41.260 --> 2:15:43.140
 I said, I'd really like you to buy lunch with me today.

2:15:43.140 --> 2:15:45.740
 I said, you really didn't have to do me that favor.

2:15:45.740 --> 2:15:46.580
 And she goes, no, sir.

2:15:46.580 --> 2:15:47.620
 I said, no, no.

2:15:47.620 --> 2:15:48.700
 I said, I want.

2:15:48.700 --> 2:15:50.860
 And it was like I gave her a million bucks.

2:15:50.860 --> 2:15:52.900
 And I say to my wife now,

2:15:52.900 --> 2:15:54.740
 I've been praying to be a billionaire.

2:15:54.740 --> 2:15:55.620
 She goes, that's a sin.

2:15:55.620 --> 2:15:57.460
 I said, no, no, you don't understand, right?

2:15:57.460 --> 2:16:00.140
 She goes, oh, you're Mr., you know, Mr. God.

2:16:00.140 --> 2:16:00.980
 I said, no, no, no.

2:16:00.980 --> 2:16:01.820
 I said, you're getting it wrong.

2:16:01.820 --> 2:16:04.900
 I said, I'm praying to be like a multi gazillionaire

2:16:04.900 --> 2:16:07.060
 because I want to give it all away.

2:16:07.060 --> 2:16:09.340
 We used to have a sign in ladder 114

2:16:09.340 --> 2:16:11.780
 until some other rival truck company stole it, right?

2:16:11.780 --> 2:16:12.620
 Cause that's what we do.

2:16:12.620 --> 2:16:14.660
 You know, they get sent to cover your district

2:16:14.660 --> 2:16:17.380
 when you're at a fire and now your stuff's missing.

2:16:17.380 --> 2:16:20.940
 And the old timers had a sign that says, I am content.

2:16:20.940 --> 2:16:23.620
 Because if you got to ladder 114,

2:16:23.620 --> 2:16:25.860
 that was considered such a great place,

2:16:25.860 --> 2:16:28.860
 such a great assignment, such great guys.

2:16:28.860 --> 2:16:30.300
 You had to be vetted to get there.

2:16:30.300 --> 2:16:31.700
 You couldn't just randomly go.

2:16:31.700 --> 2:16:35.100
 And it was a little exclusionary, but they wanted good guys.

2:16:36.220 --> 2:16:38.660
 And I said to myself, that's who I am in life right now.

2:16:38.660 --> 2:16:42.620
 I am content, but I'm restless

2:16:42.620 --> 2:16:44.980
 because I want to really do a lot more good.

2:16:44.980 --> 2:16:46.820
 It's like this podcast.

2:16:46.820 --> 2:16:50.060
 I want to make sure that it's not forgotten.

2:16:50.060 --> 2:16:52.060
 And I want to make sure that these charities

2:16:52.060 --> 2:16:55.700
 that are really, really helping people get recognized.

2:16:55.700 --> 2:16:57.660
 But I'd like to take it a step further, right?

2:16:57.660 --> 2:17:00.220
 A friend of mine runs this foundation

2:17:00.220 --> 2:17:05.100
 for young folks suffering mental illness and in crisis.

2:17:06.300 --> 2:17:08.460
 It's for someone that we love dearly.

2:17:08.460 --> 2:17:13.460
 And he's on a mission now to get therapy dogs

2:17:14.500 --> 2:17:18.660
 for really, really mentally wounded warriors, right?

2:17:18.660 --> 2:17:23.260
 A lot of these young soldiers are having a really hard time.

2:17:23.260 --> 2:17:25.460
 And now they could be out a while.

2:17:25.460 --> 2:17:28.940
 They may have come back in country two, three years ago.

2:17:28.940 --> 2:17:30.540
 Now it's just starting to set in.

2:17:31.540 --> 2:17:34.820
 And there's a waiting list for thousands of therapy dogs.

2:17:34.820 --> 2:17:39.460
 And he said that they can't get enough of them quick enough.

2:17:39.460 --> 2:17:42.060
 But he said, when you see the response,

2:17:42.060 --> 2:17:45.260
 the way these veterans just light up

2:17:45.260 --> 2:17:46.300
 when they get these dogs,

2:17:46.300 --> 2:17:50.180
 it just changes their life radically, immediately.

2:17:50.180 --> 2:17:51.860
 And I said, that's it.

2:17:51.860 --> 2:17:54.860
 God, I don't know how I'm going to do it,

2:17:54.860 --> 2:17:57.060
 but I want to be a gazillionaire.

2:17:57.060 --> 2:18:00.820
 And I don't want any picture, photo ops, this, that.

2:18:00.820 --> 2:18:02.740
 I just want to go, there's a dog, there's a dog,

2:18:02.740 --> 2:18:03.940
 there's a dog, there's a dog.

2:18:03.940 --> 2:18:05.980
 And then I want to build veterans land

2:18:05.980 --> 2:18:10.020
 for these vets who just need a nice clean place to live.

2:18:10.020 --> 2:18:12.180
 So why don't we take these old army bases

2:18:12.180 --> 2:18:15.980
 and Marine bases and Navy bases that have been shut down.

2:18:15.980 --> 2:18:17.900
 They're just sitting there rotting away.

2:18:17.900 --> 2:18:19.900
 I was in the army in Alabama.

2:18:19.900 --> 2:18:23.420
 My old Fort McClellan is three quarters vacant.

2:18:23.420 --> 2:18:24.260
 It's sitting there.

2:18:24.260 --> 2:18:25.340
 They just did a documentary on it.

2:18:25.340 --> 2:18:27.900
 It just looks like zombie land going back to zombies.

2:18:27.900 --> 2:18:30.740
 So why don't we take that and renovate it

2:18:30.740 --> 2:18:33.020
 and say to vets who are struggling,

2:18:33.020 --> 2:18:35.300
 hey guys, you're going to live here.

2:18:35.300 --> 2:18:39.660
 And they take the old army,

2:18:39.660 --> 2:18:41.980
 the places where they had all the supplies,

2:18:41.980 --> 2:18:44.860
 there's massive buildings where you could just retrofit it

2:18:44.860 --> 2:18:48.580
 and make light manufacturing within two weeks.

2:18:48.580 --> 2:18:49.700
 Give these guys jobs.

2:18:49.700 --> 2:18:51.060
 There they live, there they work.

2:18:51.060 --> 2:18:52.220
 They'll take care of it.

2:18:52.220 --> 2:18:55.620
 Military guys, they teach you how to take care of stuff.

2:18:55.620 --> 2:18:58.220
 How the hell in this country should any vet

2:18:58.220 --> 2:19:00.660
 come back home and be homeless?

2:19:00.660 --> 2:19:03.220
 Because now they have to dedicate their lives

2:19:03.220 --> 2:19:05.140
 for six, seven, 10, 12 years,

2:19:05.140 --> 2:19:09.540
 five, six deployments making $7.50 an hour.

2:19:09.540 --> 2:19:10.940
 And then they spend seven years

2:19:10.940 --> 2:19:13.540
 or they get a whopping $16 an hour.

2:19:13.540 --> 2:19:16.580
 They walk out making 35 grand.

2:19:16.580 --> 2:19:18.820
 And now no one gives them a job.

2:19:18.820 --> 2:19:20.260
 No one gives them a chance.

2:19:20.260 --> 2:19:22.340
 So very quickly they end up homeless

2:19:23.380 --> 2:19:24.740
 by no fault of their own.

2:19:25.940 --> 2:19:28.980
 And I don't know how that's even possible.

2:19:28.980 --> 2:19:31.660
 The people in this country who've given the very most

2:19:32.980 --> 2:19:35.260
 and they're struggling, they're hurting.

2:19:35.260 --> 2:19:36.100
 That's not fair.

2:19:36.100 --> 2:19:39.460
 And my whole thing is if I can have this dream

2:19:39.460 --> 2:19:43.620
 of succeeding, so to speak, I want to try to change it.

2:19:45.940 --> 2:19:48.460
 So that's why I'm praying to be a billionaire.

2:19:48.460 --> 2:19:52.500
 My Irish mother probably wouldn't agree either

2:19:52.500 --> 2:19:53.980
 because you're not supposed to, right?

2:19:53.980 --> 2:19:56.420
 Well, I'm the same with you.

2:19:56.420 --> 2:19:59.300
 The more money you have, the more you're able to help.

2:19:59.300 --> 2:20:02.860
 Yeah, you can put smiles on people's faces.

2:20:02.860 --> 2:20:07.100
 I have to ask you, the US invaded Afghanistan

2:20:07.100 --> 2:20:11.420
 in October, 2001 in response to terror attacks.

2:20:11.420 --> 2:20:14.140
 Now 20 years later, we still had a presence

2:20:14.140 --> 2:20:17.340
 and abruptly withdrew all troops.

2:20:17.340 --> 2:20:20.460
 What do you think about this war across the world

2:20:20.460 --> 2:20:23.380
 that was sparked by this tragedy?

2:20:23.380 --> 2:20:26.900
 Whenever you do something quickly without thinking it out,

2:20:26.900 --> 2:20:30.260
 thinking it through and planning, it doesn't succeed.

2:20:31.500 --> 2:20:34.140
 I understand that we needed to exit.

2:20:34.140 --> 2:20:36.860
 I mean, how long were you gonna stay over there?

2:20:36.860 --> 2:20:41.380
 And we've lost over 7,000 of our young souls over there.

2:20:43.100 --> 2:20:45.100
 For sometimes people, I don't know if they're grateful

2:20:45.100 --> 2:20:46.220
 for it or not, right?

2:20:46.220 --> 2:20:48.660
 I mean, I don't know.

2:20:48.660 --> 2:20:51.620
 So there's the other element, and sorry to interrupt.

2:20:51.620 --> 2:20:55.220
 One is the financial of $6 trillion

2:20:55.220 --> 2:20:59.460
 and that money is not just money, it's education,

2:20:59.460 --> 2:21:03.860
 it's everything, it's money that could have gone towards,

2:21:03.860 --> 2:21:05.580
 first of all, the first responders,

2:21:05.580 --> 2:21:08.780
 but all the servicemen and women of all kinds

2:21:08.780 --> 2:21:10.060
 throughout this country.

2:21:10.060 --> 2:21:12.020
 And then there's the other side,

2:21:12.020 --> 2:21:15.260
 which is the over 800,000 people who died

2:21:15.260 --> 2:21:18.420
 in direct result of this conflict.

2:21:18.420 --> 2:21:21.260
 So not just the American side of the troops,

2:21:21.260 --> 2:21:24.180
 but just people who died, those humans.

2:21:24.180 --> 2:21:29.180
 And those humans, many of them civilians,

2:21:30.980 --> 2:21:34.980
 that's spreading hate, especially if you have leaders

2:21:34.980 --> 2:21:38.500
 on the other side who frame the death of those civilians

2:21:38.500 --> 2:21:41.780
 in certain ways that just spreads hate throughout the world.

2:21:41.780 --> 2:21:46.220
 And so you think about this kind of 20 year saga

2:21:46.220 --> 2:21:51.220
 and think, what are the ways that money could be spent better

2:21:51.420 --> 2:21:55.020
 and what was the way that we could have spread more love

2:21:55.020 --> 2:21:56.780
 in the world versus hate?

2:21:56.780 --> 2:22:01.300
 And you wonder, but then the other side, what is it?

2:22:01.300 --> 2:22:04.780
 I'm not sure who says this line,

2:22:04.780 --> 2:22:08.620
 but it's something like we sleep at night

2:22:08.620 --> 2:22:11.460
 because there's a rough men out there

2:22:11.460 --> 2:22:13.780
 ready to fight for you.

2:22:15.100 --> 2:22:18.260
 There is some sense in which we have to make sure

2:22:18.260 --> 2:22:21.180
 that there's strength coupled with the love, right?

2:22:21.180 --> 2:22:26.180
 Otherwise evil men will do evil onto the world.

2:22:27.840 --> 2:22:29.580
 So it's a very difficult decision,

2:22:29.580 --> 2:22:31.980
 but then you look at the final picture

2:22:31.980 --> 2:22:35.340
 and it's like, what have we gotten for this $6 trillion?

2:22:35.340 --> 2:22:37.700
 What have we gotten for this 20 years?

2:22:37.700 --> 2:22:41.220
 The thousands of American soldiers who died,

2:22:41.220 --> 2:22:45.880
 the hundreds of thousands of civilians who have died.

2:22:49.300 --> 2:22:53.620
 You know, it's a troubling subject for me.

2:22:53.620 --> 2:22:55.700
 I'm a patriot, I love this country.

2:22:55.700 --> 2:22:58.180
 I love it with my soul.

2:22:58.180 --> 2:23:02.900
 And I was just about to head over to the first Iraqi war

2:23:02.900 --> 2:23:04.820
 and we went out for desert warfare training

2:23:04.820 --> 2:23:06.220
 and then it ended.

2:23:06.220 --> 2:23:08.500
 I was at that time a combat medic assigned

2:23:08.500 --> 2:23:09.660
 to an armored cav unit.

2:23:09.660 --> 2:23:11.940
 So basically tanks driving around

2:23:11.940 --> 2:23:14.100
 an armored personnel carrier and when it gets hit,

2:23:14.100 --> 2:23:17.560
 then you tend to that guy, try to save his life.

2:23:18.500 --> 2:23:19.780
 I didn't wanna go.

2:23:19.780 --> 2:23:23.500
 I may sound like a coward, I did not wanna go to war.

2:23:23.500 --> 2:23:26.860
 I would have went willingly if I was sent

2:23:26.860 --> 2:23:28.760
 to defend my country, I took my oath.

2:23:30.060 --> 2:23:32.940
 I didn't join the military to kill,

2:23:32.940 --> 2:23:34.740
 but if necessary, I would.

2:23:36.440 --> 2:23:38.080
 I'll use the analogy of cancer.

2:23:38.960 --> 2:23:42.220
 If you have a cancer and you're aware of its presence

2:23:42.220 --> 2:23:44.140
 and you don't annihilate those cells

2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:48.740
 and take them out quickly, it's gonna spread

2:23:48.740 --> 2:23:49.940
 and it's gonna kill you.

2:23:51.540 --> 2:23:55.500
 Those evil bastards that flew those airplanes,

2:23:55.500 --> 2:23:57.580
 one of those airplanes had a little three year old child

2:23:57.580 --> 2:24:00.240
 in it from Ireland where my mom's hometown.

2:24:01.140 --> 2:24:03.100
 A friend of mine who since died of a heart attack

2:24:03.100 --> 2:24:05.820
 from 9 11 toxins, he found her shoe

2:24:05.820 --> 2:24:07.060
 with human remains in it.

2:24:08.500 --> 2:24:09.940
 And he thought someone was messing with us

2:24:09.940 --> 2:24:12.180
 because we didn't know there was any kids in the building.

2:24:12.180 --> 2:24:15.060
 He says, boss, there's a baby shoe

2:24:15.060 --> 2:24:16.980
 and it looks like there's something in it,

2:24:16.980 --> 2:24:18.340
 but there's no kids in the trade center.

2:24:18.340 --> 2:24:21.860
 I went, the plane, it's a little girl shoe.

2:24:21.860 --> 2:24:25.100
 I can never get that shoe out of my mind.

2:24:26.480 --> 2:24:28.720
 The evil bastards who perpetrated that

2:24:28.720 --> 2:24:32.240
 needed to have missiles strike and rain down upon them

2:24:32.240 --> 2:24:35.080
 and annihilate them like a cancer that they are.

2:24:35.080 --> 2:24:38.440
 What just fascinates me is they'll show videos

2:24:38.440 --> 2:24:40.720
 of these guys flying around and pick up trucks

2:24:40.720 --> 2:24:41.960
 with 50 cows on the back.

2:24:41.960 --> 2:24:43.280
 It's like, well, wait a minute.

2:24:43.280 --> 2:24:45.800
 If a camera crew can get this footage,

2:24:45.800 --> 2:24:48.960
 you think all these freaking drones and planes

2:24:48.960 --> 2:24:52.360
 and radar assisted systems can't just go

2:24:52.360 --> 2:24:56.320
 whist, whist, whist, goodnight, you're gone.

2:24:56.320 --> 2:25:00.280
 So kill the cancer, kill the cells, get rid of it,

2:25:00.280 --> 2:25:03.760
 get rid of it quickly and go into remission.

2:25:03.760 --> 2:25:08.120
 Like an undeniable show of force that sends a message

2:25:08.120 --> 2:25:13.120
 that gets rid of most of the obvious centers of terrorism.

2:25:15.560 --> 2:25:17.160
 And that note, that's though,

2:25:17.160 --> 2:25:20.040
 because we offline mentioned a discussion with Jaco

2:25:20.040 --> 2:25:25.040
 and maybe romanticize view and mentioning brothers in arms

2:25:25.640 --> 2:25:29.800
 by dire straits and saying we're all brothers in arms

2:25:29.800 --> 2:25:32.380
 even when it's on the opposite side of fighting,

2:25:32.380 --> 2:25:35.720
 which is more of a vision and growing up in the Soviet Union

2:25:35.720 --> 2:25:39.520
 you saw about World War II, that it's all just kids

2:25:39.520 --> 2:25:43.200
 thrown into the kids sent to die in all sides.

2:25:43.200 --> 2:25:48.200
 But then presenting that to Jaco who was in Iraq,

2:25:51.040 --> 2:25:55.240
 he did not see as brothers in arms,

2:25:55.240 --> 2:26:00.240
 which is his basic statement is there's evil people

2:26:00.740 --> 2:26:03.880
 and some people don't deserve the compassion.

2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:05.240
 You give them a few chances,

2:26:05.240 --> 2:26:07.480
 they don't take the chances they have to go

2:26:07.480 --> 2:26:09.880
 because they're spreading evil onto the world.

2:26:09.880 --> 2:26:14.280
 And so it's not, we're not, all of us deserve a chance.

2:26:14.280 --> 2:26:16.800
 Oh no, absolutely, but the difference though,

2:26:16.800 --> 2:26:21.800
 and believe me, I, Jaco, I am from a way, way minor league

2:26:21.880 --> 2:26:22.860
 compared to him, right?

2:26:22.860 --> 2:26:25.400
 I mean, this man was right there in the firing line,

2:26:25.400 --> 2:26:28.080
 but I can understand his analogy

2:26:28.080 --> 2:26:29.200
 because when you think about it, right,

2:26:29.200 --> 2:26:31.840
 those young conscripts back in Germany and Russia

2:26:31.840 --> 2:26:34.040
 and all the countries where they were being drafted,

2:26:34.040 --> 2:26:37.320
 even our guys were being drafted and thrown into this.

2:26:37.320 --> 2:26:42.320
 They were gallantly and bravely defending their country.

2:26:43.640 --> 2:26:47.060
 Now, I'm sure the young Germans felt,

2:26:47.060 --> 2:26:49.500
 well, hey, Hitler must be right, right?

2:26:49.500 --> 2:26:51.840
 And young Russians felt, hey, Stalin must be right.

2:26:51.840 --> 2:26:54.640
 And the young Americans figured,

2:26:54.640 --> 2:26:57.200
 hey, President Roosevelt must be right.

2:26:57.200 --> 2:27:00.640
 So they were romantically in a sense

2:27:00.640 --> 2:27:04.500
 defending the honor of their country, of their motherland.

2:27:04.500 --> 2:27:06.440
 The difference between those,

2:27:06.440 --> 2:27:08.120
 so they did have that commonality.

2:27:08.120 --> 2:27:10.540
 If you and I were firing across each other

2:27:10.540 --> 2:27:12.840
 from France to Germany or, you know,

2:27:12.840 --> 2:27:14.820
 from Germany to Russia or whatever,

2:27:14.820 --> 2:27:17.100
 we're just these two kids who got thrown into this.

2:27:17.100 --> 2:27:19.320
 We didn't freaking ask for this, right?

2:27:19.320 --> 2:27:21.620
 But the difference with Jaco's enemy is

2:27:22.700 --> 2:27:26.480
 no one was attacking their country over there, right?

2:27:26.480 --> 2:27:28.600
 No one was taking their country over.

2:27:28.600 --> 2:27:31.000
 Maybe in their mind, they didn't want people

2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:33.120
 trying to build their government, this and that.

2:27:33.120 --> 2:27:35.480
 I don't know, I don't know enough about the history there

2:27:35.480 --> 2:27:37.020
 to really elaborate.

2:27:38.680 --> 2:27:40.100
 We didn't attack them.

2:27:41.600 --> 2:27:44.240
 And if a soldier attacks a soldier,

2:27:44.240 --> 2:27:47.360
 that's an understood concept amongst warriors.

2:27:47.360 --> 2:27:49.680
 But when a soldier attacks a civilian,

2:27:49.680 --> 2:27:51.960
 now you're after a different beast,

2:27:51.960 --> 2:27:54.720
 and you've written that beast off, if that makes any sense.

2:27:54.720 --> 2:27:59.280
 Yeah, and the enemy, I mean, as Jaco explains,

2:27:59.280 --> 2:28:03.940
 the enemy in Iraq and just certain parts of the Middle East

2:28:03.940 --> 2:28:08.940
 is essentially terrorists who don't value the lives

2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:11.800
 of the civilians of their own country.

2:28:11.800 --> 2:28:12.640
 They don't.

2:28:12.640 --> 2:28:15.480
 And so it becomes like this weird guerrilla warfare

2:28:15.480 --> 2:28:20.160
 slash game of violence that ultimately allows them

2:28:20.160 --> 2:28:22.340
 to gain more power within their country,

2:28:22.340 --> 2:28:24.740
 but they don't care if they're playing

2:28:24.740 --> 2:28:26.920
 with civilian lives as pawns.

2:28:26.920 --> 2:28:29.080
 If you have a child who dies

2:28:31.040 --> 2:28:33.840
 that's a civilian in their country,

2:28:33.840 --> 2:28:35.720
 that could be seen as a positive for them

2:28:35.720 --> 2:28:37.440
 because they can use that to leverage

2:28:37.440 --> 2:28:40.920
 for more and more power within that country.

2:28:40.920 --> 2:28:44.100
 So when you're fighting an enemy like that,

2:28:44.100 --> 2:28:46.200
 that's a vicious, that's an evil enemy.

2:28:46.200 --> 2:28:47.100
 Absolutely.

2:28:47.100 --> 2:28:48.840
 It's like snakes are beautiful,

2:28:48.840 --> 2:28:50.400
 but if you go pet a rattler,

2:28:50.400 --> 2:28:52.700
 you're getting bit and you're getting dead, right?

2:28:52.700 --> 2:28:53.880
 And that's with terrorists,

2:28:53.880 --> 2:28:55.880
 you've got to cut the head of the snake off.

2:28:55.880 --> 2:28:59.280
 And I feel, no, don't commit our guys to be there anymore.

2:28:59.280 --> 2:29:01.800
 But what we need to do is go with tech warfare.

2:29:01.800 --> 2:29:05.140
 If we have intel from drones or planes or whatever it is

2:29:05.140 --> 2:29:07.480
 that so and so and so and so and so and so

2:29:07.480 --> 2:29:09.560
 are driving down in that pickup or whatever,

2:29:09.560 --> 2:29:11.840
 take it out and do it again tomorrow

2:29:11.840 --> 2:29:12.760
 and tomorrow and tomorrow.

2:29:12.760 --> 2:29:15.680
 And maybe they'll get the message after a while,

2:29:15.680 --> 2:29:17.960
 oh shit, these guys aren't messing around.

2:29:17.960 --> 2:29:21.160
 Instead of throwing wave after wave of our brave warriors,

2:29:21.160 --> 2:29:24.780
 brave SEALs, brave special ops guys,

2:29:24.780 --> 2:29:27.840
 and God bless them for what they do, I couldn't do it.

2:29:27.840 --> 2:29:29.340
 I could not have done it.

2:29:29.340 --> 2:29:33.200
 But they have to be now sitting home going,

2:29:34.520 --> 2:29:35.580
 what the hell?

2:29:36.440 --> 2:29:38.960
 My friends, my body, myself,

2:29:38.960 --> 2:29:41.420
 like they must feel so betrayed

2:29:41.420 --> 2:29:43.960
 because they passionately went over there

2:29:43.960 --> 2:29:47.120
 to cure a cancer, the cancer of terrorism.

2:29:48.040 --> 2:29:49.640
 And now the cancer is back.

2:29:50.680 --> 2:29:51.600
 And I hate to say it,

2:29:51.600 --> 2:29:54.320
 but I think the cancer might start running wild.

2:29:54.320 --> 2:29:55.840
 We need to change our tactics up.

2:29:55.840 --> 2:29:57.040
 This is just my opinion.

2:29:57.040 --> 2:30:00.440
 I can't see committing all of our guys

2:30:00.440 --> 2:30:04.240
 to a continuous eternal war.

2:30:04.240 --> 2:30:07.180
 But I think what we need to do is hit surgically

2:30:07.180 --> 2:30:11.200
 and hit hard at that cancer that is over there.

2:30:11.200 --> 2:30:13.180
 We are never gonna rebuild that region.

2:30:14.200 --> 2:30:17.280
 It's just, it's thousands of years of traditions

2:30:17.280 --> 2:30:18.760
 that you're not going to change.

2:30:18.760 --> 2:30:22.120
 It's just some people are unchangeable

2:30:22.120 --> 2:30:23.520
 because they don't want to.

2:30:23.520 --> 2:30:27.840
 And we have so many social problems here in our country,

2:30:27.840 --> 2:30:29.800
 I think that we need to fix first.

2:30:31.400 --> 2:30:33.960
 I heard this spoken in the past by many people.

2:30:33.960 --> 2:30:35.720
 It's like the garden theory.

2:30:35.720 --> 2:30:37.920
 You have your garden with a fence around it.

2:30:37.920 --> 2:30:39.200
 You tend to your garden.

2:30:39.200 --> 2:30:41.320
 There may be weeds on the outside of the fence,

2:30:41.320 --> 2:30:43.800
 but as long as they're not inside your garden,

2:30:43.800 --> 2:30:45.720
 your garden will prosper.

2:30:45.720 --> 2:30:49.640
 And I know some people don't agree to that America first

2:30:49.640 --> 2:30:52.240
 and the whole take care of our own,

2:30:52.240 --> 2:30:56.960
 but it's like, how are we gonna take in more people now?

2:30:56.960 --> 2:31:01.320
 And I have a human feeling for them,

2:31:01.320 --> 2:31:03.520
 but it's almost like the lifeboat theory.

2:31:03.520 --> 2:31:05.840
 How many people can we take into the lifeboat

2:31:05.840 --> 2:31:10.140
 before the lifeboat itself sinks as the ship is going down?

2:31:10.140 --> 2:31:13.680
 So if we can't take care of our own homeless vets

2:31:13.680 --> 2:31:15.800
 and our own homeless people,

2:31:15.800 --> 2:31:20.040
 and it's just gonna become worse.

2:31:20.040 --> 2:31:21.840
 And it doesn't make any sense.

2:31:21.840 --> 2:31:25.200
 It's just like, we need to just take a timeout

2:31:25.200 --> 2:31:29.840
 and I think switch our tactics a little bit.

2:31:29.840 --> 2:31:33.320
 And invest into helping people here at home.

2:31:33.320 --> 2:31:35.520
 Absolutely, absolutely.

2:31:35.520 --> 2:31:38.880
 There's very few as obvious of cases

2:31:38.880 --> 2:31:41.200
 as the first responders in 9 11.

2:31:42.400 --> 2:31:47.400
 That one of the things that I really wanna kind of talk about

2:31:47.560 --> 2:31:48.720
 at least a little bit,

2:31:48.720 --> 2:31:51.320
 we've already talked about the amazing project

2:31:51.320 --> 2:31:56.320
 that you're doing the 20 for 20 podcast that you host.

2:31:56.640 --> 2:31:59.340
 We mentioned one story, Steven Siller,

2:31:59.340 --> 2:32:00.920
 is there other stories

2:32:00.920 --> 2:32:02.800
 or maybe you can speak out at a high level,

2:32:02.800 --> 2:32:04.520
 what are you hoping to tell?

2:32:04.520 --> 2:32:07.160
 And all these different stories that are weaved

2:32:07.160 --> 2:32:12.160
 about that connect the tragedies and the triumphs,

2:32:14.280 --> 2:32:16.800
 the heroism of that day

2:32:16.800 --> 2:32:19.400
 and the days and the years that followed.

2:32:19.400 --> 2:32:22.160
 You know, Lex, it seems like the common few themes,

2:32:22.160 --> 2:32:26.940
 the common threads are being selfless,

2:32:26.940 --> 2:32:29.820
 helping out others even though they might be a stranger,

2:32:31.280 --> 2:32:34.520
 in acts of kindness, acts of love,

2:32:34.520 --> 2:32:37.380
 and it seems to all be weaved together with faith.

2:32:37.380 --> 2:32:39.920
 They all seem to have some sort of faith.

2:32:39.920 --> 2:32:44.080
 I mean, we have one gentleman, Mark Hanna,

2:32:44.080 --> 2:32:47.240
 and he's a Coptic Egyptian priest,

2:32:47.240 --> 2:32:49.320
 and he's an immigrant to the United States.

2:32:49.320 --> 2:32:51.720
 He was a port authority building engineer.

2:32:51.720 --> 2:32:56.060
 And with his crew who subsequently passed away,

2:32:56.060 --> 2:33:00.000
 the crew did, he was effectively rescuing dozens of people

2:33:00.000 --> 2:33:01.520
 on the upper floors,

2:33:01.520 --> 2:33:04.400
 and his boss ordered him to assist an elderly gentleman

2:33:04.400 --> 2:33:09.400
 who was 89 down 78 flights of stairs to get him out.

2:33:09.680 --> 2:33:12.440
 And in stopping on the 21st floor,

2:33:12.440 --> 2:33:14.880
 he figured they would just wait there for medics.

2:33:14.880 --> 2:33:18.880
 He came across Captain Patty Brown of Ladder Company 3,

2:33:18.880 --> 2:33:21.800
 who told him, no, sir, you need to evacuate.

2:33:21.800 --> 2:33:23.940
 And Captain Brown picked his brain a little bit

2:33:23.940 --> 2:33:25.760
 about the structure because he figured,

2:33:25.760 --> 2:33:27.880
 found out he was an engineer.

2:33:27.880 --> 2:33:30.920
 And Captain Patty Brown continued on to effect rescues,

2:33:30.920 --> 2:33:32.920
 and he and his crew were killed.

2:33:32.920 --> 2:33:34.600
 But father, he's now,

2:33:34.600 --> 2:33:38.880
 Mark was able to effectively evacuate this gentleman.

2:33:38.880 --> 2:33:40.840
 They were the two known last survivors

2:33:40.840 --> 2:33:42.520
 to come out of the tower.

2:33:42.520 --> 2:33:45.960
 He now has dedicated his life to becoming a Coptic priest

2:33:45.960 --> 2:33:49.520
 in St. Mary's Church in East Brunswick, New Jersey.

2:33:49.520 --> 2:33:51.240
 He did this for a total stranger.

2:33:51.240 --> 2:33:55.960
 And he said he was inspired by his bosses who died

2:33:55.960 --> 2:33:58.080
 and his friends.

2:33:58.080 --> 2:33:59.960
 One of his best friends was an Italian man.

2:33:59.960 --> 2:34:03.520
 The other man was a retired Navy SEAL, Hispanic man.

2:34:03.520 --> 2:34:05.540
 And they were part of this melting pot.

2:34:05.540 --> 2:34:07.320
 And no one looked at each other that day,

2:34:07.320 --> 2:34:09.280
 what color, what race, what belief are you?

2:34:09.280 --> 2:34:12.460
 They just said, hey, you're a human in need, let's go.

2:34:12.460 --> 2:34:16.360
 And we have the story about John Field

2:34:16.360 --> 2:34:18.840
 on his mission to help the responders.

2:34:19.680 --> 2:34:21.000
 We have a young lady, Mariah,

2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:24.460
 whose birth father was on flight 93.

2:34:24.460 --> 2:34:26.160
 She had not even met him.

2:34:26.160 --> 2:34:28.760
 And she had this premonition that somebody in her family

2:34:28.760 --> 2:34:29.680
 was killed that day.

2:34:29.680 --> 2:34:33.680
 And her adopted mom said, no, everyone's fine.

2:34:33.680 --> 2:34:35.920
 Three years later, when she was legally able

2:34:35.920 --> 2:34:37.320
 to find out who her dad was,

2:34:37.320 --> 2:34:40.600
 she found out that her dad, Tom, was actually on that plane

2:34:40.600 --> 2:34:43.040
 as part of the Let's Roll team.

2:34:43.040 --> 2:34:46.280
 And we have a gentleman, Robert Burke,

2:34:46.280 --> 2:34:49.480
 who's an actor, sweetheart of a man.

2:34:49.480 --> 2:34:52.880
 He's a gentleman and he's a very, very popular actor

2:34:52.880 --> 2:34:53.720
 in Hollywood.

2:34:53.720 --> 2:34:56.080
 He was on Rescue Me, Blue Bloods, Gossip Girls.

2:34:56.080 --> 2:34:58.800
 And Bobby, my friend, as I call him,

2:34:58.800 --> 2:35:01.360
 is a volunteer fireman now.

2:35:01.360 --> 2:35:02.800
 This man doesn't need to get out of bed

2:35:02.800 --> 2:35:05.320
 at two oclock in the morning and help people with a stroke

2:35:05.320 --> 2:35:07.240
 or a burning garage or a burning house,

2:35:07.240 --> 2:35:09.520
 but he does because he wants to.

2:35:09.520 --> 2:35:12.160
 Because his best friend was Captain Patty Brown.

2:35:12.160 --> 2:35:14.520
 And his other best friend was Father Michael Judge,

2:35:14.520 --> 2:35:16.840
 who was our chaplain, who was killed,

2:35:16.840 --> 2:35:20.320
 literally blessing the victims at the site,

2:35:20.320 --> 2:35:22.400
 had just given last rites to the firefighter

2:35:22.400 --> 2:35:24.800
 I mentioned earlier, Danny, who was killed.

2:35:24.800 --> 2:35:26.920
 And Father Judge was in the lobby of the building,

2:35:26.920 --> 2:35:30.280
 giving a blessing, praying to God to please stop this.

2:35:30.280 --> 2:35:33.440
 And he was struck by debris and he was killed.

2:35:33.440 --> 2:35:37.560
 And Bobby goes on to elaborate about Father Judge's story.

2:35:37.560 --> 2:35:39.840
 Father Judge used to walk the streets of New York City,

2:35:39.840 --> 2:35:42.680
 helping AIDS patients just with whatever they needed.

2:35:42.680 --> 2:35:45.000
 And he was a Franciscan friar.

2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:46.920
 They wear sandals and a robe.

2:35:46.920 --> 2:35:49.880
 They just live very humble lives.

2:35:50.800 --> 2:35:55.080
 And it's just a common denominator is loving each other

2:35:56.040 --> 2:35:57.400
 and helping each other,

2:35:57.400 --> 2:36:00.160
 regardless of you know the person or not.

2:36:00.160 --> 2:36:01.920
 And really, when you think about it,

2:36:01.920 --> 2:36:03.680
 that's how America was made.

2:36:03.680 --> 2:36:06.040
 We fought for independence.

2:36:06.040 --> 2:36:11.040
 Stranger fought next to stranger and fought tyranny

2:36:11.960 --> 2:36:13.680
 because they wanted freedom.

2:36:13.680 --> 2:36:18.680
 They wanted to be able to live, love, pray and prosper.

2:36:20.520 --> 2:36:22.720
 And they fought and died alongside of strangers.

2:36:22.720 --> 2:36:25.400
 And it's sort of symbolic of what happened that day.

2:36:25.400 --> 2:36:27.800
 And then strangers from around this great country

2:36:27.800 --> 2:36:31.640
 just flocked in by the thousands to help.

2:36:31.640 --> 2:36:34.320
 They didn't know who was in that pile, but they didn't care.

2:36:34.320 --> 2:36:36.400
 That was another American.

2:36:36.400 --> 2:36:38.600
 And what I ultimately am trying to do

2:36:38.600 --> 2:36:41.120
 involved in this beautiful project

2:36:41.120 --> 2:36:46.120
 is spread the message of doing the right thing.

2:36:46.280 --> 2:36:48.720
 Look at these examples.

2:36:48.720 --> 2:36:51.680
 These brave people who didn't have to,

2:36:51.680 --> 2:36:53.000
 especially the civilians,

2:36:53.000 --> 2:36:55.120
 they weren't paid to run back in there

2:36:55.120 --> 2:36:56.840
 and help person after person.

2:36:56.840 --> 2:36:59.080
 And they had no obligation.

2:36:59.080 --> 2:36:59.920
 They could have just said,

2:36:59.920 --> 2:37:02.080
 hey man, I'm out of here and just bolted.

2:37:02.080 --> 2:37:04.160
 But they didn't.

2:37:05.120 --> 2:37:07.920
 So we're just trying to say to people,

2:37:07.920 --> 2:37:11.640
 let's bring back that unity and that feeling of 912.

2:37:11.640 --> 2:37:13.880
 As strange as 912 of a day it was,

2:37:13.880 --> 2:37:18.800
 it was so sad because it was the first dawn of the sun

2:37:18.800 --> 2:37:21.600
 where we realized this wasn't a dream.

2:37:21.600 --> 2:37:24.560
 This was real and it's not going away.

2:37:24.560 --> 2:37:27.240
 But the beauty of it was there was thousands of people

2:37:27.240 --> 2:37:28.840
 lined up along the West Side Highway

2:37:28.840 --> 2:37:32.040
 with signs and American flags.

2:37:32.040 --> 2:37:34.080
 And they were from every country

2:37:34.080 --> 2:37:36.680
 and every race and every creed.

2:37:36.680 --> 2:37:38.720
 And it didn't matter who they were,

2:37:38.720 --> 2:37:42.080
 but they all shared one bond, love.

2:37:42.080 --> 2:37:47.080
 And they were hugging and crying and thanking rescuers.

2:37:47.320 --> 2:37:51.080
 And it brought the morale so high

2:37:51.080 --> 2:37:55.400
 for a group of people that was so beaten down the day before.

2:37:55.400 --> 2:37:57.120
 It just started lifting the morale

2:37:57.120 --> 2:37:59.600
 and making us realize, you know what?

2:37:59.600 --> 2:38:01.680
 People really do give a crap.

2:38:01.680 --> 2:38:04.120
 They really do love each other.

2:38:04.120 --> 2:38:05.600
 And now I'm gonna be honest with you,

2:38:05.600 --> 2:38:08.240
 I've been doubting that a little bit lately.

2:38:08.240 --> 2:38:09.920
 I still have these examples of it.

2:38:09.920 --> 2:38:12.640
 You know, that lady who helped me last night with the phone

2:38:12.640 --> 2:38:15.120
 and just, you know, I know there's these shining

2:38:15.120 --> 2:38:17.320
 little examples, but sometimes I think,

2:38:18.200 --> 2:38:20.520
 I don't know, are we running out of them?

2:38:20.520 --> 2:38:22.920
 Well, I gotta give you some advice.

2:38:22.920 --> 2:38:25.680
 So there's two words that were repeated often

2:38:27.080 --> 2:38:30.720
 in the days and the years after 911, which is never forget.

2:38:30.720 --> 2:38:35.720
 So might I remind you to never forget about 912.

2:38:36.120 --> 2:38:39.080
 I mean, those words, you talked about that, you know,

2:38:39.080 --> 2:38:43.200
 there's people, what is it, college freshmen, maybe.

2:38:43.200 --> 2:38:44.160
 They weren't even born.

2:38:44.160 --> 2:38:45.160
 They weren't even born.

2:38:45.160 --> 2:38:47.360
 And there's people in the 20s that were too young

2:38:47.360 --> 2:38:51.080
 to remember or to understand the events of that day.

2:38:51.080 --> 2:38:53.840
 But I think what that day, as you're describing, means,

2:38:53.840 --> 2:38:55.680
 it's not about a terrorist attack.

2:38:55.680 --> 2:38:58.640
 It's about the unity that followed.

2:38:58.640 --> 2:38:59.880
 It was tremendous, Lex.

2:38:59.880 --> 2:39:01.160
 I never felt so proud.

2:39:01.160 --> 2:39:03.440
 I was always proud of this country.

2:39:03.440 --> 2:39:05.520
 You know, I remember my grandpa Nels used to walk by,

2:39:05.520 --> 2:39:07.600
 I'd see a flag, I'd hear the Star Spangled Banner

2:39:07.600 --> 2:39:08.680
 and he'd tear up and I'd say,

2:39:08.680 --> 2:39:10.000
 Grant, why are you crying?

2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:12.720
 He said, I'm not crying, it's the tears of joy.

2:39:12.720 --> 2:39:15.160
 I love this country so much.

2:39:15.160 --> 2:39:17.320
 And I just remember like feeling that way.

2:39:17.320 --> 2:39:19.520
 I felt that way 910.

2:39:19.520 --> 2:39:22.560
 I felt that way on 911, but then on 912,

2:39:22.560 --> 2:39:25.200
 I was just so proud of just the people,

2:39:25.200 --> 2:39:27.280
 the way they stepped up.

2:39:27.280 --> 2:39:29.840
 And I just want to try to see if that can happen again.

2:39:29.840 --> 2:39:33.080
 And I hope it's not necessary for us to have another tragedy

2:39:33.080 --> 2:39:34.760
 to bring that about.

2:39:34.760 --> 2:39:37.040
 Let's do that without the tragedy.

2:39:37.040 --> 2:39:40.640
 Let's just stop and say, hey, you know what?

2:39:40.640 --> 2:39:43.440
 Let me listen to what this guy has to say.

2:39:43.440 --> 2:39:45.440
 And maybe he's, he probably won't convince me,

2:39:45.440 --> 2:39:47.080
 but maybe I'll go, well, you know,

2:39:47.080 --> 2:39:49.000
 I never thought of it that way.

2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:52.200
 Stop the finger pointing, the bickering,

2:39:52.200 --> 2:39:54.560
 the tantrums, the fighting.

2:39:54.560 --> 2:39:55.760
 It's just not necessary.

2:39:55.760 --> 2:39:56.880
 It gets you nowhere, right?

2:39:56.880 --> 2:39:58.640
 It's like, you know, I was two years old

2:39:58.640 --> 2:40:00.400
 and I'd stomp around because I wanted a cookie

2:40:00.400 --> 2:40:01.280
 or a piece of candy.

2:40:01.280 --> 2:40:03.000
 I still didn't get it, right?

2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:05.000
 You know, turned blue in the face and whatever,

2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:06.160
 got a little swat in the rear end,

2:40:06.160 --> 2:40:07.920
 but it didn't get the candy.

2:40:07.920 --> 2:40:09.440
 And that's what we got going on right now.

2:40:09.440 --> 2:40:12.280
 Everybody's just stomping around, being a baby.

2:40:12.280 --> 2:40:13.960
 Stop, just stop.

2:40:13.960 --> 2:40:14.800
 We're really lucky.

2:40:14.800 --> 2:40:16.800
 Look, the country's not perfect, right?

2:40:17.640 --> 2:40:19.880
 You know, but it's damn good.

2:40:19.880 --> 2:40:22.400
 It gives us all these opportunities, you know?

2:40:22.400 --> 2:40:24.120
 Like I said, no one's rushing out the gates

2:40:24.120 --> 2:40:25.040
 to get out of here.

2:40:25.040 --> 2:40:27.360
 They're freaking, I got a cousin of mine.

2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:28.200
 I love him dearly.

2:40:28.200 --> 2:40:30.360
 My cousin Tony in Ireland.

2:40:30.360 --> 2:40:32.320
 And he said, he's just a little older than me.

2:40:32.320 --> 2:40:33.160
 He's in his fifties.

2:40:33.160 --> 2:40:35.960
 He said, man, I should have done it.

2:40:35.960 --> 2:40:37.000
 I should have went to America.

2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:38.240
 My dad said, go to America.

2:40:38.240 --> 2:40:41.480
 I went to England and he went back to Ireland.

2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:43.200
 And you know, but he's happy in Ireland.

2:40:43.200 --> 2:40:44.040
 It's his home.

2:40:44.040 --> 2:40:47.120
 But he said, wow, what a place of opportunity.

2:40:47.120 --> 2:40:48.640
 And I said, it's never too late.

2:40:48.640 --> 2:40:49.640
 He goes, yeah, but you know what?

2:40:49.640 --> 2:40:50.800
 You get tied down.

2:40:50.800 --> 2:40:52.400
 And I understand that.

2:40:52.400 --> 2:40:55.360
 I thank God my mom came here at 16.

2:40:55.360 --> 2:40:57.480
 I thank God my grandpa got on that ship.

2:40:57.480 --> 2:41:00.560
 But in his 20s, 27, I think, you know,

2:41:00.560 --> 2:41:02.960
 with not a nickel to rub together.

2:41:02.960 --> 2:41:04.160
 I thank God they did it.

2:41:04.160 --> 2:41:06.720
 Cause I don't know where else I would have ended up.

2:41:06.720 --> 2:41:09.160
 There's no place else I want to be.

2:41:09.160 --> 2:41:12.200
 And I thank God that there's people like you

2:41:12.200 --> 2:41:16.200
 who rushed towards ground zero to help other human beings.

2:41:16.200 --> 2:41:19.440
 And I believe that that human spirit

2:41:19.440 --> 2:41:21.680
 is ultimately represents the best of this country

2:41:21.680 --> 2:41:23.360
 and the best of this world.

2:41:23.360 --> 2:41:25.480
 Thank you for the stories you're telling,

2:41:25.480 --> 2:41:27.760
 for your perseverance in that.

2:41:27.760 --> 2:41:31.000
 And thank you for welcoming me to the crew.

2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:31.840
 You're very welcome.

2:41:31.840 --> 2:41:32.680
 I'm proud.

2:41:32.680 --> 2:41:33.960
 And we'll take you any day.

2:41:33.960 --> 2:41:35.720
 You look like you could do the job just fine.

2:41:35.720 --> 2:41:38.840
 I love lifting heavy things and doing dangerous things.

2:41:38.840 --> 2:41:42.160
 So I'm proud to be part of this country

2:41:42.160 --> 2:41:43.920
 and part of the Tally Ho now.

2:41:43.920 --> 2:41:46.600
 Well, you are definitely an attribute to America

2:41:46.600 --> 2:41:48.800
 and we're glad you chose to come here.

2:41:48.800 --> 2:41:51.440
 You know, Lex, it's such a beautiful place.

2:41:51.440 --> 2:41:52.720
 It's a beautiful melting pot.

2:41:52.720 --> 2:41:54.080
 You know, if we were all the same,

2:41:54.080 --> 2:41:55.720
 it would be kind of a boring place, right?

2:41:55.720 --> 2:41:56.680
 Kind of boring.

2:41:56.680 --> 2:41:57.560
 It really would.

2:41:57.560 --> 2:41:59.560
 But it's just such a great place.

2:41:59.560 --> 2:42:00.680
 And I just want to say thanks.

2:42:00.680 --> 2:42:02.040
 It's an honor.

2:42:02.040 --> 2:42:04.880
 It's an honor to have someone to let me sound off

2:42:04.880 --> 2:42:06.760
 and it'll be even bigger honor

2:42:06.760 --> 2:42:08.480
 if somebody will listen to me and just say,

2:42:08.480 --> 2:42:11.520
 hey, you know, let me just try to do something good today.

2:42:11.520 --> 2:42:13.840
 And you know, that's the tunnel to towers mantra

2:42:13.840 --> 2:42:15.640
 is let us do good.

2:42:15.640 --> 2:42:17.240
 And I just, you know,

2:42:20.320 --> 2:42:22.840
 I got a really big credit card with God,

2:42:22.840 --> 2:42:24.040
 a big balance, right?

2:42:24.040 --> 2:42:26.360
 I need to pay him back a lot

2:42:26.360 --> 2:42:27.720
 and I need to pay him forward.

2:42:27.720 --> 2:42:30.480
 And I'm just going to spend the rest of my days

2:42:30.480 --> 2:42:31.400
 trying my best.

2:42:31.400 --> 2:42:33.200
 I don't know where this is going to go,

2:42:33.200 --> 2:42:34.280
 what it'll lead into,

2:42:34.280 --> 2:42:37.080
 but I really would like to get those dogs

2:42:37.080 --> 2:42:39.200
 or those vets and build them that village

2:42:39.200 --> 2:42:41.800
 and just keep going on from project to project

2:42:41.800 --> 2:42:45.560
 to just say, when my final day comes

2:42:45.560 --> 2:42:48.320
 and I'm laying there and I say, you know what?

2:42:48.320 --> 2:42:50.400
 I really made the most of that second chance

2:42:50.400 --> 2:42:52.680
 God gave me way back in 2011.

2:42:52.680 --> 2:42:55.000
 I mean, I hope it's 30, 40 years from now,

2:42:55.000 --> 2:42:57.400
 but even if it's 30 months from now,

2:42:57.400 --> 2:42:59.760
 I'm giving it the best shot.

2:42:59.760 --> 2:43:00.600
 So thank you, sir.

2:43:00.600 --> 2:43:02.920
 I appreciate it and wishing you blessings

2:43:02.920 --> 2:43:04.320
 and success in your career.

2:43:04.320 --> 2:43:05.400
 Keep up the good fight

2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:08.040
 and you're always welcome back to Texas.

2:43:08.040 --> 2:43:08.880
 Oh, I love it.

2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:11.720
 It's great food and a little hot,

2:43:11.720 --> 2:43:14.240
 a little hot, but I can deal with it.

2:43:14.240 --> 2:43:17.200
 We don't do so good Irish in the sun, you know?

2:43:17.200 --> 2:43:19.040
 Well, the barbecue and the people are worth it.

2:43:19.040 --> 2:43:20.240
 No, they are, they're awesome.

2:43:20.240 --> 2:43:23.680
 I was down here for some storm relief a few years ago

2:43:23.680 --> 2:43:25.320
 and I tell you what, I fell in love with it.

2:43:25.320 --> 2:43:26.880
 The people are great, it's a great state

2:43:26.880 --> 2:43:30.960
 and yeah, I'll definitely be back again for sure.

2:43:30.960 --> 2:43:31.960
 Thanks for talking to me, Neil.

2:43:31.960 --> 2:43:32.800
 Thank you, sir.

2:43:32.800 --> 2:43:34.240
 Appreciate it.

2:43:34.240 --> 2:43:35.840
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:43:35.840 --> 2:43:37.320
 with Niels Jorgensen.

2:43:37.320 --> 2:43:38.520

2:43:41.760 --> 2:43:43.360
 And now let me leave you with some words

2:43:43.360 --> 2:43:45.800
 from Franklin D. Roosevelt.

2:43:45.800 --> 2:43:48.920
 Human kindness has never weakened the stamina

2:43:48.920 --> 2:43:51.840
 or softened the fiber of a free people.

2:43:51.840 --> 2:43:55.480
 A nation does not have to be cruel, to be tough.

2:43:55.480 --> 2:44:18.480
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
