00:00.000 --> 00:04.620
 The following is a conversation with Ronald Sullivan, a professor at Harvard Law School

00:04.620 --> 00:08.500
 known for taking on difficult and controversial cases.

00:08.500 --> 00:14.120
 He was on the head legal defense team for the Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez

00:14.120 --> 00:16.020
 in his double murder case.

00:16.020 --> 00:21.780
 He represented one of the Gena 6 defendants and never lost the case during his years in

00:21.780 --> 00:25.960
 Washington D.C.'s Public Defender Services office.

00:25.960 --> 00:32.240
 In 2019, Ronald joined the legal defense team of Harvey Weinstein, a film producer

00:32.240 --> 00:36.460
 facing multiple charges of rape and other sexual assault.

00:36.460 --> 00:41.860
 This decision met with criticism from Harvard University students, including an online petition

00:41.860 --> 00:46.640
 by students seeking his removal as faculty dean of Winthrop House.

00:46.640 --> 00:52.240
 Then, a letter supporting him signed by 52 Harvard Law School professors appeared in

00:52.240 --> 00:56.100
 the Boston Globe on March 8, 2019.

00:56.100 --> 00:59.600
 Following this, the Harvard administration succumbed to the pressure of a few Harvard

00:59.600 --> 01:05.720
 students and announced that they will not be renewing Ronald Sullivan's dean position.

01:05.720 --> 01:11.800
 This created a major backlash in the public discourse over the necessary role of universities

01:11.800 --> 01:19.220
 in upholding the principles of law and freedom at the very foundation of the United States.

01:19.220 --> 01:24.360

01:31.440 --> 01:37.440
 As a side note, let me say that the free exchange of difficult ideas is the only mechanism through

01:37.440 --> 01:39.780
 which we can make progress.

01:39.780 --> 01:42.560
 Truth is not a safe space.

01:42.560 --> 01:46.520
 Truth is humbling, and being humbled can hurt.

01:46.520 --> 01:52.880
 But this is the role of education, not just in the university but in business and in life.

01:52.880 --> 01:58.520
 Freedom and compassion can coexist, but it requires work and patience.

01:58.520 --> 02:03.600
 It requires listening to the voices and to the experiences unlike our own.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.680
 Listening, not silencing.

02:06.680 --> 02:14.100
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here is my conversation with Ronald Sullivan.

02:14.100 --> 02:20.160
 You were one of the lawyers who represented the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in

02:20.160 --> 02:22.400
 advance of a sexual assault trial.

02:22.400 --> 02:27.840
 For this, Harvard forced you to step down as faculty deans, you and your wife of Winthrop

02:27.840 --> 02:28.840
 House.

02:28.840 --> 02:35.240
 Can you tell the story of this saga from first deciding to represent Harvey Weinstein to

02:35.240 --> 02:38.880
 the interesting complicated events that followed?

02:38.880 --> 02:40.000
 Yeah, sure.

02:40.000 --> 02:48.360
 So I got a call one morning from a colleague at the Harvard Law School who asked if I would

02:48.360 --> 02:52.600
 consent to taking a call from Harvey.

02:52.600 --> 02:56.560
 He wanted to meet me and chat with me about representing him.

02:56.560 --> 03:00.520
 I said yes, and one thing led to another.

03:00.520 --> 03:08.200
 I drove out to Connecticut where he was staying and met with him and some of his advisors,

03:08.200 --> 03:13.300
 and then a day or two later, I decided to take the case.

03:13.300 --> 03:19.000
 This would have been back in January of 2019, I believe.

03:19.000 --> 03:27.340
 So the sort of cases, I have a very small practice most of my time is teaching and writing,

03:27.340 --> 03:34.280
 but I tend to take cases that most deem to be impossible.

03:34.280 --> 03:39.480
 I take the challenging sorts of cases, and this fit the bill.

03:39.480 --> 03:46.000
 It was quite challenging in the sense that everyone had prejudged the case.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.640
 When I say everyone, I just mean the general sentiment in the public had the case prejudged,

03:52.640 --> 04:02.520
 even though the specific allegations did not regard any of the people in the New Yorker.

04:02.520 --> 04:12.280
 It's the New Yorker article that exposed everything that was going on, allegedly, with Harvey.

04:12.280 --> 04:17.160
 So I decided to take the case, and I did.

04:17.160 --> 04:22.360
 Is there a philosophy behind you taking on these very difficult cases?

04:22.360 --> 04:23.360
 Is it a set of principles?

04:23.360 --> 04:29.880
 Is it just your love of the law, or is there a set of principles why you take on the cases?

04:29.880 --> 04:38.120
 Yeah, I'd like to take on hard cases, and I like to take on the cases that are with

04:38.120 --> 04:43.640
 unpopular defendants, unpopular clients.

04:43.640 --> 04:52.640
 With respect to the latter, that's where Harvey Weinstein fell, it's because we need lawyers

04:52.640 --> 05:00.640
 and good lawyers to take the unpopular cases, because those sorts of cases determine what

05:00.640 --> 05:04.160
 sort of criminal justice system we have.

05:04.160 --> 05:09.520
 If we don't protect the rights and the liberties of those whom the society deems to be the

05:09.520 --> 05:15.200
 least and the last, the unpopular client, then that's the camel's nose under the tent.

05:15.200 --> 05:19.740
 If we let the camel's nose under the tent, the entire tent is going to collapse.

05:19.740 --> 05:26.680
 That is to say, if we short circuit the rights of a client like Harvey Weinstein, then the

05:26.680 --> 05:31.560
 next thing you know, someone will be at your door, knocking it down and violating your

05:31.560 --> 05:32.560
 rights.

05:32.560 --> 05:39.000
 There's a certain creep there with respect to the way in which the state will respect

05:39.000 --> 05:43.920
 the civil rights and civil liberties of people, and these are the sorts of cases that test

05:43.920 --> 05:44.920
 it.

05:44.920 --> 05:52.160
 For example, there was a young man many, many years ago named Ernesto Miranda.

05:52.160 --> 05:55.240
 By all accounts, he was not a likable guy.

05:55.240 --> 06:03.800
 He was a three time knife thief and not a likable guy, but lawyers stepped up and took

06:03.800 --> 06:05.060
 his case.

06:05.060 --> 06:10.280
 Because of that, we now have the Miranda warnings, you have the right to remain silent.

06:10.280 --> 06:15.460
 Those warnings that officers are forced to give to people.

06:15.460 --> 06:21.400
 So it is through these cases that we express oftentimes the best values in our criminal

06:21.400 --> 06:22.400
 justice system.

06:22.400 --> 06:28.400
 So I proudly take on these sorts of cases in order to vindicate not only the individual

06:28.400 --> 06:36.160
 rights of the person whom I'm representing, but the rights of citizens writ large, most

06:36.160 --> 06:42.880
 of whom do not experience the criminal justice system, and it's partly because of lawyers

06:42.880 --> 06:51.560
 who take on these sorts of cases and establish rules that protect us, average everyday ordinary

06:51.560 --> 06:53.680
 concrete citizens.

06:53.680 --> 06:59.640
 From a psychological perspective, just you as a human, is there fear, is there stress

06:59.640 --> 07:00.640
 from all the pressure?

07:00.640 --> 07:04.840
 Because if you're facing, I mean, the whole point, a difficult case, especially in the

07:04.840 --> 07:10.600
 latter that you mentioned of the going against popular opinion, you have the eyes of millions

07:10.600 --> 07:19.280
 potentially looking at you with anger as you try to defend this set of laws that this country's

07:19.280 --> 07:20.280
 built on.

07:20.280 --> 07:24.200
 No, it doesn't stress me out particularly.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.360
 It sort of comes with the territory.

07:26.360 --> 07:31.660
 I try not to get too excited in either direction.

07:31.660 --> 07:40.660
 So a big part of my practice is wrongful convictions, and I've gotten over 6,000 people out of

07:40.660 --> 07:46.920
 prison who've been wrongfully incarcerated, and a subset of those people have been convicted,

07:46.920 --> 07:51.640
 and people who've been in jail 20, 30 years who have gotten out.

07:51.640 --> 07:57.160
 And those are the sorts of cases where people praise you and that sort of thing.

07:57.160 --> 08:04.980
 And so, look, I do the work that I do, I'm proud of the work that I do, and in that sense

08:04.980 --> 08:11.760
 I'm sort of a part time Daoist, the expression reversal is the movement of the Dao.

08:11.760 --> 08:17.000
 So I don't get too high, I don't get too low, I just try to do my work and represent

08:17.000 --> 08:18.680
 people to the best of my ability.

08:18.680 --> 08:23.060
 So one of the hardest cases of recent history would be the Harvey Weinstein in terms of

08:23.060 --> 08:25.760
 popular opinion or unpopular opinion.

08:25.760 --> 08:33.040
 So if you continue on that line, where does that story take you, of taking on this case?

08:33.040 --> 08:40.120
 Yeah, so I took on the case and then there was a few students at the college.

08:40.120 --> 08:44.660
 So let me back up, I had an administrative post at Harvard College, which is a separate

08:44.660 --> 08:49.480
 entity from the Harvard Law School, Harvard College is the undergraduate portion of Harvard

08:49.480 --> 08:56.380
 University and the law school is obviously the law school, and I initially was appointed

08:56.380 --> 08:58.800
 as master of one of the houses.

08:58.800 --> 09:04.820
 We did a name change five or six years into it and were called faculty deans.

09:04.820 --> 09:09.500
 But the houses at Harvard are based on the college system of Oxford and Cambridge.

09:09.500 --> 09:15.040
 So when students go to Harvard after their first year, they're assigned to a particular

09:15.040 --> 09:19.040
 house or college and that's where they live and eat and so forth.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.280
 And these are undergraduate students?

09:20.280 --> 09:21.720
 These are undergraduate students.

09:21.720 --> 09:28.120
 So I was responsible for one of the houses as its faculty dean.

09:28.120 --> 09:34.480
 So it's an administrative appointment at the college and some students who clearly didn't

09:34.480 --> 09:42.120
 like Harvey Weinstein began to protest about the representation.

09:42.120 --> 09:52.040
 And from there, it just mushroomed into one of the most craven, cowardly acts by any university

09:52.040 --> 09:53.320
 in modern history.

09:53.320 --> 10:00.400
 It's just a complete and utter repudiation of academic freedom.

10:00.400 --> 10:09.320
 And it is a decision that Harvard certainly will live to regret, frankly, it's an embarrassment.

10:09.320 --> 10:16.040
 We expect students to do what students do and I encourage students to have their voices

10:16.040 --> 10:17.280
 heard and to protest.

10:17.280 --> 10:20.000
 I mean, that's what students do.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.400
 What is vexing are the adults.

10:24.400 --> 10:31.060
 The dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Claudine Gay, absolutely craven and cowardly.

10:31.060 --> 10:37.200
 The dean of the college, same thing, Rakesh Khurana, craven and cowardly.

10:37.200 --> 10:45.280
 They capitulated to the loudest voice in the room and ran around afraid of 19 year olds.

10:45.280 --> 10:50.120
 Oh, 19 year olds are upset that I need to do something.

10:50.120 --> 10:58.120
 And it appeared to me that they so desired the approval of students that they were afraid

10:58.120 --> 11:01.600
 to make the tough decision and the right decision.

11:01.600 --> 11:06.360
 It really could have been an important teaching moment at Harvard.

11:06.360 --> 11:07.920
 Very important teaching moment.

11:07.920 --> 11:13.240
 So they forced you to step down from that faculty dean position at the house.

11:13.240 --> 11:17.200
 I would push back on the description a little bit.

11:17.200 --> 11:23.820
 So I don't write the, you know, the references to the op ed I did in New York time.

11:23.820 --> 11:27.760
 Harvard made a mistake by making me step down or something like that.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.280
 So I don't write those things.

11:29.280 --> 11:33.240
 I did not step down and refuse to step down.

11:33.240 --> 11:37.440
 Harvard declined to renew my contract.

11:37.440 --> 11:44.280
 And I made it clear that I was not going to resign as a matter of principle and forced

11:44.280 --> 11:50.320
 them to do the cowardly act that they, in fact, did.

11:50.320 --> 11:59.920
 And you know, the worst thing about this, they did the college, Dean Gay and Dean Khurana,

11:59.920 --> 12:01.120
 commissioned this survey.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.700
 They've never done this before.

12:02.700 --> 12:06.880
 Survey from the students, you know, how do you feel at Winthrop House?

12:06.880 --> 12:11.080
 And the funny thing about the survey is they never released the results.

12:11.080 --> 12:13.460
 Why did they never release the results?

12:13.460 --> 12:20.200
 They never released the results because I would bet my salary that the results came

12:20.200 --> 12:21.880
 back positive for me.

12:21.880 --> 12:26.400
 And it didn't fit their narrative because most of the students were fine.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.400
 Most of the students were fine.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.520
 It was the loudest voice in the room.

12:29.520 --> 12:35.080
 So they never released it, and I challenged them to this day, release it, release it.

12:35.080 --> 12:42.600
 But no, they wanted to create this narrative.

12:42.600 --> 12:50.400
 And when the data didn't support the narrative, then they just got silent, oh, we're not going

12:50.400 --> 12:51.400
 to release it.

12:51.400 --> 12:52.480
 The students demanded it.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.920
 I demanded it.

12:53.920 --> 13:03.620
 And they wouldn't release it because I just know in my heart of hearts that it came back

13:03.620 --> 13:08.640
 in my favor that most students at Winthrop House said they were fine.

13:08.640 --> 13:13.520
 There was a group of students that weaponized the term unsafe.

13:13.520 --> 13:19.820
 They said we felt unsafe, and they bantied this term about.

13:19.820 --> 13:25.040
 But again, I'm confident that the majority of students at Winthrop House said they felt

13:25.040 --> 13:29.200
 completely fine and felt safe and so forth.

13:29.200 --> 13:36.400
 And the supermajority, I am confident, either said I feel great at Winthrop or I don't care

13:36.400 --> 13:37.640
 one way or the other.

13:37.640 --> 13:40.880
 And then there was some minority who had a different view.

13:40.880 --> 13:49.640
 But lessons learned, it was a wonderful opportunity at Winthrop.

13:49.640 --> 13:56.560
 I met some amazing students over my 10 years as master and then faculty dean, and I'm still

13:56.560 --> 14:02.820
 in touch with a number of students, some of whom are now my students at the law school.

14:02.820 --> 14:12.280
 So in the end, I thought it ended up being a great experience, the national media was

14:12.280 --> 14:15.240
 just wonderful in this, just wonderful.

14:15.240 --> 14:24.680
 People wrote such wonderful articles and accounts and wagged their finger appropriately at Harvard.

14:24.680 --> 14:28.640
 Compare me to John Adams, which I don't think is an apt comparison, but it's always great

14:28.640 --> 14:31.660
 to read something like that.

14:31.660 --> 14:37.500
 But anyway, that was the Harvard versus Harvey situation.

14:37.500 --> 14:42.520
 So that seems like a seminal mistake by Harvard, and Harvard is one of the great universities

14:42.520 --> 14:44.120
 in the world.

14:44.120 --> 14:50.480
 And sort of its successes and its mistakes are really important for the world as a beacon

14:50.480 --> 14:53.480
 of how we make progress.

14:53.480 --> 15:01.520
 So what lessons for the bigger academia that's under fire a lot these days, what bigger lessons

15:01.520 --> 15:03.520
 do you take away?

15:03.520 --> 15:06.520
 Like how do we make Harvard great?

15:06.520 --> 15:12.600
 How do we make other universities, Yale, MIT great in the face of such mistakes?

15:12.600 --> 15:24.080
 Well, I think that we have moved into a model where we have the consumerization of education.

15:24.080 --> 15:35.160
 That is to say, we have feckless administrators who make policy based on what the students

15:35.160 --> 15:37.280
 say.

15:37.280 --> 15:44.340
 Now this comment is not intended to suggest that students have no voice in governance,

15:44.340 --> 15:48.440
 but it is to suggest that the faculty are there for a reason.

15:48.440 --> 15:53.980
 They are among the greatest minds on the planet Earth in their particular fields, at schools

15:53.980 --> 15:59.840
 like Harvard and Yale, Stanford, the schools that you mentioned, MIT, quite literally the

15:59.840 --> 16:04.160
 greatest minds on Earth, they are there for a reason.

16:04.160 --> 16:11.460
 Things like curriculum and so forth are rightly in the province of faculty.

16:11.460 --> 16:17.720
 And while you take input and critique and so forth, ultimately, the grownups in the

16:17.720 --> 16:26.760
 room have to be sufficiently responsible to take charge and to direct the course of a

16:26.760 --> 16:28.720
 student's education.

16:28.720 --> 16:35.960
 And my situation is one example where it really could have been an excellent teaching moment

16:35.960 --> 16:44.120
 about the value of the Sixth Amendment, about what it means to treat people who are in the

16:44.120 --> 16:52.400
 crosshairs of the criminal justice system, but rather than having that conversation,

16:52.400 --> 16:57.880
 it's just this consumerization model, well, there's a lot of noise out here, so we're

16:57.880 --> 17:00.720
 going to react in this sort of way.

17:00.720 --> 17:07.180
 Higher education as well, unfortunately, has been commodified in other sorts of ways that

17:07.180 --> 17:17.960
 has reduced or impeded, hampered these schools commitments to free and robust and open dialogue.

17:17.960 --> 17:24.160
 So to the degree that academic freedom doesn't sit squarely at the center of the academic

17:24.160 --> 17:27.400
 mission, any school is going to be in trouble.

17:27.400 --> 17:42.760
 And I really hope that we weather this current political moment where 19 year olds without

17:42.760 --> 17:54.000
 degrees are running universities and get back to a system where faculty, where adults make

17:54.000 --> 17:59.120
 decisions in the best interests of the university and the best interests of the student.

17:59.120 --> 18:08.240
 Even to the degree though, some of those decisions may be unpopular, and that is going to require

18:08.240 --> 18:21.200
 a certain courage and hopefully in time, and I'm confident that in time, administrators

18:21.200 --> 18:25.120
 are going to begin to push back on these current trends.

18:25.120 --> 18:29.400
 Harvard's been around for a long time, it's been around for a long time for a reason,

18:29.400 --> 18:34.020
 and one of the reasons is that it understands itself not to be static.

18:34.020 --> 18:49.760
 So I have every view that Harvard is going to adapt and get itself back on course and

18:49.760 --> 18:53.200
 be around another 400 years, at least that's my hope.

18:53.200 --> 18:58.560
 So I mean, what this kind of boils down to is just having difficult conversation, difficult

18:58.560 --> 18:59.560
 debates.

18:59.560 --> 19:04.840
 When you mentioned sort of 19 year olds, and it's funny, I've seen this even at MIT, it's

19:04.840 --> 19:09.240
 not that they shouldn't have a voice.

19:09.240 --> 19:13.900
 They do seem to, I guess you have to experience it and just observe it.

19:13.900 --> 19:18.000
 They have a strangely disproportionate power.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.260
 It's very interesting to basically, I mean, you say, yes, there's great faculty and so

19:23.260 --> 19:30.840
 on, but it's not even just that the faculty is smart or wise or whatever, it's that they're

19:30.840 --> 19:33.200
 just silenced.

19:33.200 --> 19:40.040
 So the terminology that you mentioned is weaponized as sort of safe spaces or that certain conversations

19:40.040 --> 19:43.440
 make people feel unsafe.

19:43.440 --> 19:47.840
 What do you think about this kind of idea?

19:47.840 --> 19:55.520
 Is there some things that are unsafe to talk about in the university setting?

19:55.520 --> 19:58.520
 Is there lines to be drawn somewhere?

19:58.520 --> 20:04.400
 And just like you said on the flip side with a slippery slope, is it too easy for the lines

20:04.400 --> 20:05.920
 to be drawn everywhere?

20:05.920 --> 20:08.460
 Yeah, that's a great question.

20:08.460 --> 20:16.220
 So this idea of unsafe space, at least the vocabulary derives from some research, academic

20:16.220 --> 20:21.880
 research about feeling psychologically unsafe.

20:21.880 --> 20:32.520
 And so the notion here is that there are forms of psychological disquiet that impedes people

20:32.520 --> 20:39.320
 from experiencing the educational environment to the greatest degree possible.

20:39.320 --> 20:44.740
 And that's the argument.

20:44.740 --> 20:53.820
 And assuming for a moment that people do have these feelings of disquiet at elite universities

20:53.820 --> 20:59.880
 like MIT and like Harvard, that's probably the safest space people are going to be in

20:59.880 --> 21:06.840
 for their lives because when they get out into the quote unquote real world, they won't

21:06.840 --> 21:14.320
 have the sorts of nets that these schools provide, safety nets that these schools provide.

21:14.320 --> 21:20.480
 So to the extent that research is descriptive of a psychological feeling, I think that the

21:20.480 --> 21:24.480
 duty of the universities are to challenge people.

21:24.480 --> 21:29.520
 Seems to me that it's a shame to go to a place like Harvard or a place like MIT, Yale, any

21:29.520 --> 21:37.100
 of these great institutions and come out the same person that you were when you went in.

21:37.100 --> 21:42.040
 That seems to be a horrible waste of four years and money and resources.

21:42.040 --> 21:50.200
 Rather, we ought to challenge students, that they grow, challenge some of their most deeply

21:50.200 --> 21:53.180
 held assumptions.

21:53.180 --> 22:00.480
 They may continue to hold them, but the point of an education is to rigorously interrogate

22:00.480 --> 22:08.400
 these fundamental assumptions that have guided you thus far and to do it fairly and civilly.

22:08.400 --> 22:13.640
 So to the extent that there are lines that should be drawn, there's a long tradition

22:13.640 --> 22:15.760
 in the university of civil discourse.

22:15.760 --> 22:22.280
 So you should draw a line somewhere between civil discourse and uncivil discourse.

22:22.280 --> 22:29.800
 The purpose of a university is to talk difficult conversations, tough issues, talk directly

22:29.800 --> 22:33.700
 and frankly, but do it civilly.

22:33.700 --> 22:42.280
 Also to yell and cuss at somebody and that sort of thing, well, do that on your own space,

22:42.280 --> 22:47.880
 but observe the norms of civil discourse at the university.

22:47.880 --> 22:57.880
 So look, I think that the presumption ought to be that the most difficult topics are appropriate

22:57.880 --> 23:00.120
 to talk about at a university.

23:00.120 --> 23:01.840
 That ought to be the presumption.

23:01.840 --> 23:15.520
 Now should MIT, for example, give its imprimatur to someone who is espousing the flat earth

23:15.520 --> 23:20.360
 theory, the earth is flat, right?

23:20.360 --> 23:35.120
 If certain ideas are so contrary to the scientific and cultural thinking of the moment, yeah,

23:35.120 --> 23:40.640
 there's space there to draw a line and say, yeah, we're not going to give you this platform

23:40.640 --> 23:45.920
 to tell our students that the earth is flat.

23:45.920 --> 23:54.440
 But a topic that's controversial, but contestatory, that's what universities are for.

23:54.440 --> 23:58.920
 If you don't like the idea, present better ideas and articulate them.

23:58.920 --> 24:04.560
 And I think there needs to be a mechanism outside of the space of ideas of humbling.

24:04.560 --> 24:07.080
 I've done martial arts for a long time.

24:07.080 --> 24:08.960
 I got my ass kicked a lot.

24:08.960 --> 24:12.200
 I think that's really important.

24:12.200 --> 24:18.520
 In the space of ideas, I mean, even just in engineering, just all the math classes, my

24:18.520 --> 24:25.080
 memories of math, which I love, is kind of pain.

24:25.080 --> 24:32.280
 It's basically coming face to face with the idea that I'm not special, that I'm much dumber

24:32.280 --> 24:39.600
 than I thought I was, and that accomplishing anything in this world requires really hard

24:39.600 --> 24:40.600
 work.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.420
 It's really humbling.

24:42.420 --> 24:47.640
 That puts you, because I remember when I was 18 and 19, and I thought I was going to be

24:47.640 --> 24:54.240
 the smartest, the best fighter, the Nobel Prize winning, all those kinds of things.

24:54.240 --> 24:58.760
 And then you come face to face with reality, and it hurts.

24:58.760 --> 25:02.960
 And it feels like there needs to be efficient mechanisms from the best universities in the

25:02.960 --> 25:06.520
 world without abusing you.

25:06.520 --> 25:13.600
 It's a very difficult line to walk without mentally or physically abusing you, be able

25:13.600 --> 25:15.700
 to humble you.

25:15.700 --> 25:20.000
 And that's what I felt was missing in these very difficult, very important conversations

25:20.000 --> 25:28.040
 is the 19 year olds, when they spoke up, the mechanism for humbling them with ideas was

25:28.040 --> 25:29.040
 missing.

25:29.040 --> 25:39.540
 It kind of got broken down because, as you say, I sensed fear.

25:39.540 --> 25:41.560
 Everything was permeated with fear.

25:41.560 --> 25:47.020
 And fear is paralyzing, fear is destructive, especially in a place that's supposed to be

25:47.020 --> 25:50.560
 all about freedom of ideas.

25:50.560 --> 25:56.400
 And I don't know if you have anything, any thoughts to say on this whole idea of cancel

25:56.400 --> 26:03.640
 culture, where people, a lot of people use it as become political, so staying maybe

26:03.640 --> 26:07.040
 outside of the world of politics.

26:07.040 --> 26:12.940
 Is this, do you have thoughts about it, does it bother you that people are sort of put

26:12.940 --> 26:19.320
 in this bin and labeled as something and then thereby you can ignore everything they say?

26:19.320 --> 26:24.840
 I mean, Steven Pinker, there's a lot of Harvard folks that are fighting against these set

26:24.840 --> 26:27.340
 of ideas, but do you have thoughts?

26:27.340 --> 26:35.200
 I think that we as a culture are way, way, way too quick to cancel people.

26:35.200 --> 26:47.240
 And it's become almost reflexive now, someone says something or makes an offhand comment,

26:47.240 --> 26:54.120
 even a mistake, there's a move to simply cancel folks.

26:54.120 --> 27:02.920
 So I think that this, quote unquote, cancel culture has really gotten out of control at

27:02.920 --> 27:04.320
 this point.

27:04.320 --> 27:09.080
 It's forcing people to be robotic in many ways.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.080
 No offense to robots.

27:10.080 --> 27:15.720
 I was going to say, now I know I'm venturing into your intellectual domain.

27:15.720 --> 27:18.840
 For future robots watching this, no offense.

27:18.840 --> 27:24.760
 And there are minutes discouraging a lot of good people from getting into public life

27:24.760 --> 27:29.800
 in any sort of way, because who needs the stress of it?

27:29.800 --> 27:36.140
 Well, in some sense, you're an inspiration that you're able to withstand the pressure

27:36.140 --> 27:37.440
 of the masses.

27:37.440 --> 27:44.600
 But it's a sad aspect of human nature that we kind of get into these crowds and we start

27:44.600 --> 27:49.380
 chanting and it's fun for some reason, and then you forget yourself and then you sort

27:49.380 --> 27:57.160
 of wake up the next day not having anticipated the consequences of all the chanting.

27:57.160 --> 27:58.920
 And we would get ourselves in trouble in that.

27:58.920 --> 28:06.120
 I mean, there's some responsibility on social networks and the mechanisms by which they

28:06.120 --> 28:10.400
 make it more frictionless to do the chanting, to do the canceling, to do the outrage and

28:10.400 --> 28:11.400
 all that kind of stuff.

28:11.400 --> 28:14.840
 I actually, on the technology side, have a hope that that's fixable.

28:14.840 --> 28:23.600
 But yeah, it does seem to be, you know, it almost like the internet showed to us that

28:23.600 --> 28:28.560
 we have a lot of broken ways about which we communicate with each other and we're trying

28:28.560 --> 28:29.560
 to figure that out.

28:29.560 --> 28:31.880
 Same with the university.

28:31.880 --> 28:37.560
 This mistake by Harvard showed that we need to reinvent what the university is.

28:37.560 --> 28:44.560
 I mean, all of this is, it's almost like we're finding our baby deer legs and trying to strengthen

28:44.560 --> 28:48.920
 the institutions that have been very successful for a long time.

28:48.920 --> 28:54.920
 You know, the really interesting thing about Harvey Weinstein and you choosing these exceptionally

28:54.920 --> 29:06.260
 difficult cases is also thinking about what it means to defend evil people, what it means

29:06.260 --> 29:13.640
 to defend these, we could say unpopular, and you might push back against the word evil,

29:13.640 --> 29:16.880
 but bad people in society.

29:16.880 --> 29:20.120
 First of all, do you think there's such a thing as evil or do you think all people are

29:20.120 --> 29:24.360
 good and it's just circumstances that create evil?

29:24.360 --> 29:29.760
 And also, is there somebody too evil for the law to defend?

29:29.760 --> 29:36.180
 So the first question, that's a deep philosophical question, whether the category of evil does

29:36.180 --> 29:38.920
 any work for me.

29:38.920 --> 29:39.920
 It does for me.

29:39.920 --> 29:49.160
 I do think that, I do subscribe to that category that there is evil in the world as conventionally

29:49.160 --> 29:51.560
 understood.

29:51.560 --> 29:57.360
 So there are many who will say, yeah, that just doesn't do any work for me.

29:57.360 --> 30:04.960
 But the category evil, in fact, does intellectual work for me and I understand it as something

30:04.960 --> 30:08.400
 that exists.

30:08.400 --> 30:11.600
 Is it genetic or is it the circumstance?

30:11.600 --> 30:13.480
 What kind of work does it do for you intellectually?

30:13.480 --> 30:21.600
 I think that it's highly contingent, that is to say that the conditions in which one

30:21.600 --> 30:32.600
 grows up and so forth begins to create this category that we may think of as evil.

30:32.600 --> 30:42.020
 Now there are studies and whatnot that show that certain brain abnormalities and so forth

30:42.020 --> 30:45.580
 are more prevalent in, say, serial killer.

30:45.580 --> 30:54.560
 So there may be a biological predisposition to certain forms of conduct, but I don't

30:54.560 --> 31:05.480
 have the biological evidence to make a statement that someone is born evil and I'm not a determinist

31:05.480 --> 31:11.500
 thinker in that way, so you come out the womb evil and you're destined to be that way.

31:11.500 --> 31:21.280
 To the extent there may be biological determinants, they still require some nurture as well.

31:21.280 --> 31:26.440
 But do you still put a responsibility on the individual?

31:26.440 --> 31:27.720
 Of course, yeah.

31:27.720 --> 31:36.820
 We all make choices and so some responsibility on the individual indeed.

31:36.820 --> 31:45.360
 We live in a culture, unfortunately, where a lot of people have a constellation of bad

31:45.360 --> 31:49.960
 choices in front of them and that makes me very sad.

31:49.960 --> 31:56.360
 Some people grow up with predominantly bad choices in front of them and that's unfair

31:56.360 --> 32:00.640
 and that's on all of us, but yes, I do think we make choices.

32:00.640 --> 32:08.180
 Wow, that's so powerful, the constellation of bad choices.

32:08.180 --> 32:17.520
 That's such a powerful way to think about equality, which is the set of trajectories

32:17.520 --> 32:19.820
 before you that you could take.

32:19.820 --> 32:27.600
 If you just roll the dice, life is a kind of optimization problem, sorry to take this

32:27.600 --> 32:33.440
 into math, over a set of trajectories under imperfect information.

32:33.440 --> 32:44.640
 So you're going to do a lot of stupid shit to put it in technical terms, but the fraction

32:44.640 --> 32:49.880
 of the trajectories that take you into bad places or into good places is really important

32:49.880 --> 32:51.960
 and that's ultimately what we're talking about.

32:51.960 --> 32:57.520
 And evil might be just a little bit of a predisposition biologically, but the rest is just trajectories

32:57.520 --> 32:58.520
 that you can take.

32:58.520 --> 33:01.360
 I've been studying Hitler a lot recently.

33:01.360 --> 33:06.040
 I've been reading probably way too much and it's interesting to think about all the possible

33:06.040 --> 33:14.040
 trajectories that could have avoided this particular individual developing the hate

33:14.040 --> 33:23.240
 that he did, the following that he did, the actual final, there's a few turns in him psychologically

33:23.240 --> 33:33.280
 where he went from being a leader that just wants to conquer and to somebody who allowed

33:33.280 --> 33:40.080
 his anger and emotion to take over, to where he started making mistakes in terms of militarily

33:40.080 --> 33:46.360
 speaking, but also started doing evil things.

33:46.360 --> 33:51.280
 And all the possible trajectories that could have avoided that are fascinating, including

33:51.280 --> 34:00.360
 he wasn't that bad at painting, at drawing from the very beginning and his time in Vienna,

34:00.360 --> 34:04.080
 there's all these possible things to think about and of course there's millions of others

34:04.080 --> 34:08.320
 like him that never came to power and all those kinds of things.

34:08.320 --> 34:12.640
 But that goes to the second question on the side of evil.

34:12.640 --> 34:18.000
 Do you think, and Hitler's often brought up as like an example of somebody who is like

34:18.000 --> 34:25.960
 the epitome of evil, do you think you would, if you got that same phone call after World

34:25.960 --> 34:37.960
 War II and Hitler survived during the trial for war crimes, would you take the case defending

34:37.960 --> 34:39.700
 Adolf Hitler?

34:39.700 --> 34:46.000
 If you don't want to answer that one, is there a line to draw for evil for who not to defend?

34:46.000 --> 34:51.760
 No, I think everyone, I'll do the second one first, everyone has a right to a defense

34:51.760 --> 34:56.040
 if you're charged criminally in the United States of America.

34:56.040 --> 35:03.320
 So no, I do not think that there's someone so evil that they do not deserve a defense.

35:03.320 --> 35:05.440
 Process matters.

35:05.440 --> 35:11.820
 Process helps us get to results more accurately than we would otherwise.

35:11.820 --> 35:18.100
 So it is important and it's vitally important and indeed more important for someone deemed

35:18.100 --> 35:23.760
 to be evil to receive the same quantum of process and the same substance of process

35:23.760 --> 35:25.620
 that anyone else would.

35:25.620 --> 35:31.480
 It's vitally important to the health of our criminal justice system for that to happen.

35:31.480 --> 35:38.340
 So yes, everybody, Hitler included, were he charged in the United States for a crime that

35:38.340 --> 35:44.700
 occurred in the United States, yes.

35:44.700 --> 35:49.760
 Whether I would do it, if I were a public defender and assigned the case, yes, I started

35:49.760 --> 35:51.680
 my career as a public defender.

35:51.680 --> 35:56.040
 I represent anyone who was assigned to me.

35:56.040 --> 35:59.320
 I think that is our duty.

35:59.320 --> 36:10.000
 In private practice, I have choices and I likely, based on the hypo you gave me, and

36:10.000 --> 36:15.400
 I would tweak it a bit because it would have to be a U.S. crime.

36:15.400 --> 36:19.320
 But I get the broader point and don't want to bog down in technicalities.

36:19.320 --> 36:30.120
 I'd likely pass right now as I see it, unless it was a case where nobody else would represent

36:30.120 --> 36:40.800
 him, then I would think that I have some sort of duty and obligation to do it.

36:40.800 --> 36:45.840
 But yes, everyone absolutely deserves a right to competent counsel.

36:45.840 --> 36:52.840
 That is a beautiful ideal, it's difficult to think about it in the face of public pressure.

36:52.840 --> 37:00.300
 It's just, I mean, it's kind of terrifying to watch the masses during this past year

37:00.300 --> 37:08.240
 of 2020, to watch the power of the masses to make a decision before any of the data

37:08.240 --> 37:17.600
 is out, if the data is ever out, any of the details, any of the processes, and there is

37:17.600 --> 37:20.600
 an anger to the justice system.

37:20.600 --> 37:25.280
 There's a lot of people that feel like even though the ideal you describe is a beautiful

37:25.280 --> 37:30.380
 one, it does not always operate justly.

37:30.380 --> 37:35.000
 It does not operate to the best of its ideals, it operates unfairly.

37:35.000 --> 37:42.880
 When we go to the big picture of the criminal justice system, what do you, given the ideal,

37:42.880 --> 37:48.840
 works about our criminal justice system and what is broken?

37:48.840 --> 37:54.880
 Well there's a lot broken right now, and I usually focus on that.

37:54.880 --> 37:59.080
 But in truth, a lot works about our criminal justice system.

37:59.080 --> 38:07.920
 So there's an old joke, and it's funny, but it carries a lot of truth to it.

38:07.920 --> 38:16.840
 And the joke is that in the United States, we have the worst criminal justice system

38:16.840 --> 38:20.840
 in the world, except for every place else.

38:20.840 --> 38:29.040
 And yes, we certainly have a number of problems, and a lot of problems based on race and class,

38:29.040 --> 38:36.160
 and economics, station, but we have a process that privileges liberty.

38:36.160 --> 38:40.420
 And that's a good feature of the criminal justice system.

38:40.420 --> 38:41.640
 So here's how it works.

38:41.640 --> 38:49.900
 The idea of the relationship between the individual and the state is such that in the United States,

38:49.900 --> 38:57.920
 we privilege liberty over and above very many values, so much so that a statement by increased

38:57.920 --> 39:04.640
 Mather not terribly far from where we're sitting right now has gained traction over

39:04.640 --> 39:10.840
 all these years, and it's that better ten guilty go free than one innocent person convicted.

39:10.840 --> 39:18.340
 That is an expression of the way in which we understand liberty to operate in our collective

39:18.340 --> 39:19.420
 consciousness.

39:19.420 --> 39:28.260
 We would rather a bunch of guilty people go free than to impact the liberty interests

39:28.260 --> 39:30.900
 of any individual person.

39:30.900 --> 39:36.840
 So that's a guiding principle in our criminal justice system, liberty.

39:36.840 --> 39:42.880
 So we set a process that makes it difficult to convict people.

39:42.880 --> 39:51.120
 We have rules of procedure that are cumbersome and that slow down the process and that exclude

39:51.120 --> 39:58.240
 otherwise reliable evidence, and this is all because we place a value on liberty.

39:58.240 --> 40:04.640
 And I think these are good things, and it says a lot about our criminal justice system.

40:04.640 --> 40:11.640
 Some of the bad features have to do with the way in which this country sees color as a

40:11.640 --> 40:18.600
 proxy for criminality and treats people of color in radically different ways in the criminal

40:18.600 --> 40:27.300
 justice system, from arrests to charging decisions to sentencing.

40:27.300 --> 40:33.920
 People of color are disproportionately impacted on all sorts of registers.

40:33.920 --> 40:44.240
 One example, and it's a popular one, that although there appears to be no distinguishable

40:44.240 --> 40:52.940
 difference between drug use by whites and blacks in the country, blacks, though only

40:52.940 --> 41:00.960
 12% of the population represent 40% of the drug charges in the country, there's some

41:00.960 --> 41:09.800
 disequities along race and class in the criminal justice system that we really have to fix.

41:09.800 --> 41:16.380
 And they've grown to more than bugs in the system and have become features, unfortunately,

41:16.380 --> 41:17.380
 of our system.

41:17.380 --> 41:23.160
 Oh, to make it more efficient, to make judgments, so the racism makes it more efficient.

41:23.160 --> 41:33.520
 It efficiently moves people from society to the streets, and a lot of innocent people

41:33.520 --> 41:35.000
 get caught up in that.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.360
 Well, let me ask in terms of the innocents.

41:39.360 --> 41:50.360
 So you've gotten a lot of people who are innocent, I guess, revealed their innocence, demonstrated

41:50.360 --> 41:51.640
 their innocence.

41:51.640 --> 41:53.240
 What's that process like?

41:53.240 --> 41:55.440
 What's it like emotionally, psychologically?

41:55.440 --> 42:04.860
 What's it like legally to fight the system through the process of revealing the innocence

42:04.860 --> 42:05.860
 of a human being?

42:05.860 --> 42:09.040
 Yeah, emotionally and psychologically, it can be taxing.

42:09.040 --> 42:17.240
 I follow a model of what's called empathic representation, and that is I get to know

42:17.240 --> 42:22.040
 my clients and their family, that I get to know their strivings, their aspirations, their

42:22.040 --> 42:24.420
 fears, their sorrows.

42:24.420 --> 42:32.080
 So that certainly sometimes can do psychic injury on one.

42:32.080 --> 42:42.700
 If you get really invested and really sad or happy, it does become emotionally taxing.

42:42.700 --> 42:48.840
 But the idea of someone sitting in jail for 20 years completely innocent of a crime, can

42:48.840 --> 42:54.920
 you imagine sitting there every day for 20 years knowing that you factually did not do

42:54.920 --> 42:59.820
 the thing that you were convicted of by a jury of your peers?

42:59.820 --> 43:05.560
 It's got to be the most incredible thing in the world.

43:05.560 --> 43:09.680
 But the people who do it and the people who make it and come out on the other side as

43:09.680 --> 43:16.860
 productive citizens are folks who say they've come to an inner peace in their own minds

43:16.860 --> 43:27.800
 and they say, these bars aren't going to define me, that my humanity is there and it's immutable.

43:27.800 --> 43:30.680
 And they are not bitter, which is amazing.

43:30.680 --> 43:33.600
 I tend to think that I'm not that good of a person.

43:33.600 --> 43:39.480
 I would be bitter for every day of 20 years if I were in jail for something.

43:39.480 --> 43:44.820
 But people tell me that they can't survive, that one cannot survive like that.

43:44.820 --> 43:47.000
 And you have to come to terms with it.

43:47.000 --> 43:57.600
 And the people whom I've exonerated, most of them come out and they just really just

43:57.600 --> 44:02.480
 take on life with a vim and vigor without bitterness.

44:02.480 --> 44:04.400
 And it's a beautiful thing to see.

44:04.400 --> 44:10.800
 Do you think it's possible to eradicate racism from the judicial system?

44:10.800 --> 44:11.800
 I do.

44:11.800 --> 44:19.280
 I think that race insinuates itself in all aspects of our lives and the judicial system

44:19.280 --> 44:21.300
 is not immune from that.

44:21.300 --> 44:30.080
 So to the extent we begin to eradicate dangerous and deleterious race thinking from society

44:30.080 --> 44:36.320
 generally, then it will be eradicated from the criminal justice system.

44:36.320 --> 44:42.040
 I think we've got a lot of work to do and I think it'll be a while, but I think it's

44:42.040 --> 44:43.040
 doable.

44:43.040 --> 44:52.200
 I mean, you know, the country – so historians will look back 300 years from now and take

44:52.200 --> 45:02.480
 note of the incredible journey of diasporic Africans in the U.S., an incredible journey

45:02.480 --> 45:12.560
 from slavery to the heights of politics and business and judiciary and the academy and

45:12.560 --> 45:17.620
 so forth in not a lot of time, in actually not a lot of time.

45:17.620 --> 45:25.120
 And if we can have that sort of movement historically, let's think about what the next 175 years

45:25.120 --> 45:26.120
 will look like.

45:26.120 --> 45:31.640
 I'm not saying it's going to be short, but I'm saying that if we keep at it, keep

45:31.640 --> 45:41.120
 getting to know each other a little better, keep enforcing laws that prohibit the sort

45:41.120 --> 45:48.360
 of race based discrimination that people have experienced and provide as a society opportunities

45:48.360 --> 45:55.200
 for people to thrive in this world, then I think we can see a better world and if we

45:55.200 --> 45:57.720
 see a better world, we'll see a better judicial system.

45:57.720 --> 46:01.960
 So I think it's kind of fascinating if you look throughout history and race is just part

46:01.960 --> 46:11.800
 of that is we create the other and treat the other with disdain through the legal system,

46:11.800 --> 46:13.800
 but just through human nature.

46:13.800 --> 46:18.440
 I tend to believe, we mentioned offline that I work with robots.

46:18.440 --> 46:22.000
 It sounds absurd to say, especially to you, especially because we're talking about racism

46:22.000 --> 46:28.520
 and it's so prevalent today, I do believe that there will be almost like a civil rights

46:28.520 --> 46:39.440
 movement for robots because I think there's a huge value to society of having artificial

46:39.440 --> 46:49.200
 intelligence systems that interact with humans and are human like and the more they become

46:49.200 --> 46:58.480
 human like, they will start to ask very fundamentally human questions about freedom, about suffering,

46:58.480 --> 47:05.960
 about justice, and they will have to come face to face, like look in the mirror in asking

47:05.960 --> 47:14.360
 the question, just because we're biologically based, just because we're sort of, well, just

47:14.360 --> 47:20.120
 because we're human, does that mean we're the only ones that deserve the rights?

47:20.120 --> 47:26.200
 Again, giving, forming another other group, which is robots, and I'm sure there could

47:26.200 --> 47:32.400
 be along that path different versions of other that we form.

47:32.400 --> 47:39.260
 So racism, race is certainly a big other that we've made, as you said, a lot of progress

47:39.260 --> 47:44.000
 on throughout the history of this country, but it does feel like we always create, as

47:44.000 --> 47:47.040
 we make progress, create new other groups.

47:47.040 --> 47:52.460
 And of course the other group that perhaps is outside the legal system that people talk

47:52.460 --> 48:00.140
 about is the essential, now I eat a lot of meat, but the torture of animals, the people

48:00.140 --> 48:04.460
 talk about when we look back from a couple of centuries from now, look back at the kind

48:04.460 --> 48:09.400
 of things we're doing to animals, we might regret that, we might see that in a very different

48:09.400 --> 48:10.400
 light.

48:10.400 --> 48:15.240
 And it's kind of interesting to see the future trajectory of what we wake up to about the

48:15.240 --> 48:20.140
 injustice in our ways.

48:20.140 --> 48:25.020
 But the robot one is the one I'm especially focused on, but at this moment in time it

48:25.020 --> 48:29.640
 seems ridiculous, but I'm sure most civil rights movements throughout history seem ridiculous

48:29.640 --> 48:30.640
 at first.

48:30.640 --> 48:38.860
 Well, it's interesting, sort of outside of my intellectual bailiwick robots, as I understand

48:38.860 --> 48:53.400
 the development of artificial intelligence, though the aspect that still is missing is

48:53.400 --> 49:04.680
 this notion of consciousness, and that it's consciousness that is the thing that will

49:04.680 --> 49:11.940
 move if it were to exist, and I'm not saying that it can or will, but if it were to exist

49:11.940 --> 49:23.260
 would move robots from machines to something different, something that experienced the

49:23.260 --> 49:29.600
 world in a way analogous to how we experience it.

49:29.600 --> 49:37.100
 And also as I understand the science, there's, unlike what you see on television, that we're

49:37.100 --> 49:46.620
 not there yet in terms of this notion of the machines having a consciousness.

49:46.620 --> 49:49.820
 Or a great general intelligence, all those kinds of things.

49:49.820 --> 49:50.820
 Yeah, yeah.

49:50.820 --> 49:56.540
 A huge amount of progress has been made, and it's fascinating to watch, so I'm on both

49:56.540 --> 50:02.180
 minds as a person who's building them, I'm realizing how sort of quote unquote dumb they

50:02.180 --> 50:09.600
 are, but also looking at human history and how poor we are predicting the progress of

50:09.600 --> 50:11.860
 innovation and technology.

50:11.860 --> 50:17.780
 It's obvious that we have to be humble by our ability to predict, coupled with the fact

50:17.780 --> 50:25.080
 that we keep, to use terminology carefully here, we keep discriminating against the intelligence

50:25.080 --> 50:28.160
 of artificial systems.

50:28.160 --> 50:33.880
 The smarter they get, the more ways we find to dismiss their intelligence.

50:33.880 --> 50:38.900
 So this has just been going on throughout.

50:38.900 --> 50:45.900
 It's almost as if we're threatened in the most primitive human way, animalistic way.

50:45.900 --> 50:52.440
 We're threatened by the power of other creatures, and we want to lessen, dismiss them.

50:52.440 --> 50:57.900
 So consciousness is a really important one, but the one I think about a lot in terms of

50:57.900 --> 51:03.740
 consciousness, the very engineering question, is whether the display of consciousness is

51:03.740 --> 51:06.880
 the same as the possession of consciousness.

51:06.880 --> 51:15.240
 So if a robot tells you they are conscious, if a robot looks like they're suffering when

51:15.240 --> 51:21.220
 you torture them, if a robot is afraid of death and says they're afraid of death and

51:21.220 --> 51:31.280
 are legitimately afraid, in terms of just everything we as humans use to determine the

51:31.280 --> 51:38.220
 ability of somebody to be their own entity, they're the one that loves, one that fears,

51:38.220 --> 51:47.460
 one that hopes, one that can suffer, if a robot in the dumbest of ways is able to display

51:47.460 --> 51:53.260
 that, it starts changing things very quickly.

51:53.260 --> 51:58.540
 I'm not sure what it is, but it does seem that there's a huge component to consciousness

51:58.540 --> 52:05.640
 that is a social creation, like we together create our consciousness, like we believe

52:05.640 --> 52:09.300
 our common humanity together.

52:09.300 --> 52:15.600
 Alone we wouldn't be aware of our humanity, and the law as it protects our freedoms seems

52:15.600 --> 52:22.660
 to be a construct of the social construct, and when you add other creatures into it,

52:22.660 --> 52:28.740
 it's not obvious to me that you have to build, there'll be a moment when you say, this thing

52:28.740 --> 52:30.620
 is now conscious.

52:30.620 --> 52:35.380
 I think there's going to be a lot of fake it until you make it, and there'll be a very

52:35.380 --> 52:42.980
 gray area between fake and make that is going to force us to contend with what it means

52:42.980 --> 52:48.900
 to be an entity that deserves rights, where all men are created equal.

52:48.900 --> 52:55.140
 The men part might have to expand in ways that we are not yet anticipating.

52:55.140 --> 52:56.140
 It's very interesting.

52:56.140 --> 53:01.300
 I mean, my favorite, the fundamental thing I love about artificial intelligence is it

53:01.300 --> 53:02.620
 gets smarter and smarter.

53:02.620 --> 53:09.700
 It challenges to think of what is right, the questions of justice, questions of freedom.

53:09.700 --> 53:21.700
 It basically challenges us to understand our own mind, to understand what, almost from

53:21.700 --> 53:26.760
 an engineering first principles perspective, to understand what it is that makes us human,

53:26.760 --> 53:31.340
 that is at the core of all the rights that we talk about and all the documents we write.

53:31.340 --> 53:36.660
 So even if we don't give rights to artificial intelligence systems, we may be able to construct

53:36.660 --> 53:40.220
 more fair legal systems to protect us humans.

53:40.220 --> 53:49.380
 Well, I mean, interesting ontological question between the performance of consciousness and

53:49.380 --> 53:58.420
 actual consciousness to the extent that actual consciousness is anything beyond some contingent

53:58.420 --> 53:59.420
 reality.

53:59.420 --> 54:04.940
 But you've posed a number of interesting philosophical questions, and then there's

54:04.940 --> 54:13.580
 also, it strikes me that philosophers of religion would pose another set of questions as well

54:13.580 --> 54:27.060
 when you deal with issues of structure versus soul, body versus soul, and it will be a complicated

54:27.060 --> 54:33.860
 mix and I suspect I'll be dust by the time those questions get worked out.

54:33.860 --> 54:37.060
 And so, yeah, the soul is a fun one.

54:37.060 --> 54:41.940
 There's no soul, I'm not sure maybe you can correct me, but there's very few discussion

54:41.940 --> 54:44.620
 of soul in our legal system, right?

54:44.620 --> 54:47.740
 Right, correct, none.

54:47.740 --> 54:53.060
 But there is a discussion about what constitutes a human being, and I mean, you gestured at

54:53.060 --> 55:01.940
 the notion of the potential of the law widening the domain of a human being.

55:01.940 --> 55:10.140
 So in that sense, right, you know, people are very angry because they can't get sort

55:10.140 --> 55:17.980
 of pain and suffering damages if someone negligently kills a pet because a pet is not a human being.

55:17.980 --> 55:25.380
 And people say, well, I love my pet, but the law sees a pet as chattel, as property like

55:25.380 --> 55:27.940
 this water bottle.

55:27.940 --> 55:37.420
 So the current legal definitions trade on a definition of humanity that may not be worked

55:37.420 --> 55:45.400
 out in any sophisticated way, but certainly there's a broad and shared understanding

55:45.400 --> 55:47.700
 of what it means.

55:47.700 --> 55:55.260
 So it probably doesn't explicitly contain a definition of something like soul, but it's

55:55.260 --> 56:02.100
 more robust than, you know, a carbon based organism, that there's something a little

56:02.100 --> 56:07.060
 more distinct about what the law thinks a human being is.

56:07.060 --> 56:12.740
 So if we can dive into, we've already been doing it, but if we can dive into more difficult

56:12.740 --> 56:14.400
 territory.

56:14.400 --> 56:20.740
 So 2020 had the tragic case of George Floyd.

56:20.740 --> 56:27.820
 Can you reflect on the protests, on the racial tensions over the death of George Floyd?

56:27.820 --> 56:29.700
 How do you make sense of it all?

56:29.700 --> 56:32.540
 What do you take away from these events?

56:32.540 --> 56:44.420
 The George Floyd moment occurred at an historical moment where people were in quarantine for

56:44.420 --> 56:56.300
 COVID, and people have these cell phones to a degree greater than we've ever had them

56:56.300 --> 56:57.300
 before.

56:57.300 --> 57:03.580
 And this was sort of the straw that broke the camel's back after a number of these sorts

57:03.580 --> 57:08.100
 of cell phone videos surfaced.

57:08.100 --> 57:10.860
 People were fed up.

57:10.860 --> 57:21.940
 There was unimpeachable evidence of a form of mistreatment, whether it constitutes murder

57:21.940 --> 57:28.020
 or manslaughter, the trial is going on now, and jurors will figure that out, but there

57:28.020 --> 57:36.500
 was widespread appreciation that a fellow human being was mistreated, that we were just

57:36.500 --> 57:43.980
 talking about humanity, that there was not a sufficient recognition of this person's

57:43.980 --> 57:44.980
 humanity.

57:44.980 --> 57:46.700
 The common humanity of this person, yeah.

57:46.700 --> 57:50.040
 The common humanity of this person, well said.

57:50.040 --> 57:51.180
 And people were fed up.

57:51.180 --> 57:59.780
 So we were already in this COVID space where we were exercising care for one another, and

57:59.780 --> 58:04.740
 there was just an explosion, the likes of which this country hasn't seen since the civil

58:04.740 --> 58:10.700
 rights protests of the 1950s and 1960s.

58:10.700 --> 58:15.800
 And people simply said, enough, enough, enough, enough.

58:15.800 --> 58:17.000
 This has to stop.

58:17.000 --> 58:23.260
 We cannot treat fellow citizens in this way, and we can't do it with impunity.

58:23.260 --> 58:28.380
 And the young people said, we're not going to stand for it anymore, and they took to

58:28.380 --> 58:30.140
 the streets.

58:30.140 --> 58:38.540
 But with millions of people protesting, there is nevertheless taking us back to the most

58:38.540 --> 58:40.680
 difficult of trials.

58:40.680 --> 58:45.700
 You have the trial, like you mentioned, that's going on now, of Derek Chauvin, of one of

58:45.700 --> 58:49.580
 the police officers involved.

58:49.580 --> 58:51.220
 What are your thoughts?

58:51.220 --> 58:57.380
 What are your predictions on this trial where the law, the process of the law is trying

58:57.380 --> 59:01.740
 to proceed in the face of so much racial tension?

59:01.740 --> 59:04.420
 Yeah, it's going to be an interesting trial.

59:04.420 --> 59:10.820
 I've been keeping an eye on it there in jury selection now, today, as we're talking.

59:10.820 --> 59:14.020
 So a lot's going to depend on what sort of jury gets selected.

59:14.020 --> 59:21.140
 Yeah, sorry to interrupt, but so one of the interesting qualities of this trial, maybe

59:21.140 --> 59:26.060
 you can correct me if I'm wrong, but the cameras are allowed in the courtroom, at least during

59:26.060 --> 59:28.340
 the jury selection.

59:28.340 --> 59:31.780
 So you get to watch some of this stuff.

59:31.780 --> 59:36.340
 And the other part is the jury selection, again, I'm very inexperienced, but it seems

59:36.340 --> 59:43.900
 like selecting an, what is it, unbiased jury is really difficult for this trial.

59:43.900 --> 59:54.180
 It almost like, I don't know, me as a listener, listening to people that are trying to talk

59:54.180 --> 1:00:00.420
 their way into the jury kind of thing, trying to decide, is this person really unbiased?

1:00:00.420 --> 1:00:06.460
 Are they just trying to hold on to their like deeply held emotions and trying to get onto

1:00:06.460 --> 1:00:07.460
 the jury?

1:00:07.460 --> 1:00:09.140
 I mean, it's an incredibly difficult process.

1:00:09.140 --> 1:00:13.740
 I don't know if you can comment on a case so difficult, like the ones you've mentioned

1:00:13.740 --> 1:00:20.580
 before, how do you select a jury that represents the people and doesn't, and carries the sort

1:00:20.580 --> 1:00:22.100
 of the ideal of the law?

1:00:22.100 --> 1:00:23.100
 Yeah.

1:00:23.100 --> 1:00:24.100
 So a couple things.

1:00:24.100 --> 1:00:28.900
 Yes, it is televised and it will be televised, as they say, gavel to gavel.

1:00:28.900 --> 1:00:32.620
 So the entire trial, the whole thing is going to be televised.

1:00:32.620 --> 1:00:39.580
 So people are getting a view of how laborious jury selection can be.

1:00:39.580 --> 1:00:44.340
 I think as of yesterday, they had picked six jurors and it's taken a week and they have

1:00:44.340 --> 1:00:46.460
 to get to 14.

1:00:46.460 --> 1:00:52.660
 So they've got, you know, probably another week or more to do.

1:00:52.660 --> 1:00:56.380
 I've been in jury trials where it took a month to choose a jury.

1:00:56.380 --> 1:01:01.700
 So that's the most important part, you have to choose the right sort of jury.

1:01:01.700 --> 1:01:06.740
 So unbiased in the criminal justice system has a particular meaning.

1:01:06.740 --> 1:01:12.100
 It means that, let me tell you what it doesn't mean.

1:01:12.100 --> 1:01:17.780
 It doesn't mean that a person is not aware of the case.

1:01:17.780 --> 1:01:22.820
 It also does not mean that a person hasn't formed an opinion about the case.

1:01:22.820 --> 1:01:26.380
 Those are two popular misconceptions.

1:01:26.380 --> 1:01:31.580
 What it does mean is that notwithstanding whether an individual has formed an opinion,

1:01:31.580 --> 1:01:37.580
 notwithstanding whether an individual knows about the case, that individual can set aside

1:01:37.580 --> 1:01:43.140
 any prior opinions, can set aside any notions that they've developed about the case and

1:01:43.140 --> 1:01:49.020
 listen to the evidence presented at trial in conjunction with the judge's instructions

1:01:49.020 --> 1:01:53.380
 on how to understand and view that evidence.

1:01:53.380 --> 1:01:58.780
 So if a person can do that, then they're considered unbiased.

1:01:58.780 --> 1:02:07.540
 So as a longtime defense attorney, I would be hesitant in a big case like this to pick

1:02:07.540 --> 1:02:11.940
 a juror who's never heard of the case or anything going around because I'm thinking, well, who

1:02:11.940 --> 1:02:17.940
 is this person and what in the world do they do?

1:02:17.940 --> 1:02:18.940
 Or are they lying to me?

1:02:18.940 --> 1:02:23.060
 I mean, how can you not have heard about this case?

1:02:23.060 --> 1:02:25.980
 So they may bring other problems.

1:02:25.980 --> 1:02:30.900
 So I don't mind so much people who've heard about the case or folks who've formed initial

1:02:30.900 --> 1:02:40.260
 opinions, but what you don't want is people who have tethered themselves to that opinion

1:02:40.260 --> 1:02:46.500
 in a way that they can't be convinced otherwise.

1:02:46.500 --> 1:02:52.100
 But you also have people who, as you suggested, who just lie because they want to get on the

1:02:52.100 --> 1:02:54.460
 jury or lie because they want to get off the jury.

1:02:54.460 --> 1:03:02.220
 So sometimes people come and say the most ridiculous, outrageous, offensive things because

1:03:02.220 --> 1:03:05.020
 they know that they'll get excused for cause.

1:03:05.020 --> 1:03:11.220
 And others who, you can tell, really badly want to get on the jury.

1:03:11.220 --> 1:03:20.080
 So they pretend to be the most neutral, unbiased person in the world, what the law calls the

1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:21.180
 reasonable person.

1:03:21.180 --> 1:03:28.300
 We have in law the reasonable person standard, and I would tell my class the reasonable person

1:03:28.300 --> 1:03:34.060
 in real life is the person that you would be least likely to want to have a drink with.

1:03:34.060 --> 1:03:40.560
 They're the most boring, neutral, not interesting sort of person in the world.

1:03:40.560 --> 1:03:48.180
 And so a lot of jurors engage in the performative act of presenting themselves as the most sort

1:03:48.180 --> 1:03:52.820
 of even killed, rational, reasonable person because they really want to get on the jury.

1:03:52.820 --> 1:03:57.940
 Yeah, there's an interesting question, I apologize, I haven't watched a lot because it is very

1:03:57.940 --> 1:03:58.940
 long.

1:03:58.940 --> 1:04:06.180
 You know, there's certain questions you ask in the jury selection.

1:04:06.180 --> 1:04:15.220
 I remember I think one jumped out at me, which is something like, does the fact that this

1:04:15.220 --> 1:04:21.140
 person is a police officer make you feel any kind of way about them?

1:04:21.140 --> 1:04:27.220
 So trying to get at that, you know, I don't know what that is, I guess that's bias.

1:04:27.220 --> 1:04:33.000
 And it's such a difficult question to ask, like I asked myself with that question, like

1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:39.420
 how much, you know, we all kind of want to pretend that we're not racist, we don't judge,

1:04:39.420 --> 1:04:44.560
 we don't have, we're like these, we're the reasonable human, but, you know, legitimately

1:04:44.560 --> 1:04:53.140
 asking yourself like, what are the prejudgments you have in your mind?

1:04:53.140 --> 1:04:55.740
 Is that even impossible for a human being?

1:04:55.740 --> 1:04:59.540
 Like when you look at yourself in the mirror and think about it, is it possible to actually

1:04:59.540 --> 1:05:00.540
 answer that?

1:05:00.540 --> 1:05:01.540
 Yeah.

1:05:01.540 --> 1:05:08.060
 Look, I do not believe that people can be completely unbiased.

1:05:08.060 --> 1:05:15.820
 We all have baggage and bias and bring it wherever we go, including to court.

1:05:15.820 --> 1:05:25.540
 What you want is to try to find a person who can at least recognize when a bias is working

1:05:25.540 --> 1:05:29.180
 and actively try to do the right thing.

1:05:29.180 --> 1:05:31.720
 That's the best we can ask.

1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:36.940
 So if a juror says, yeah, you know, I grew up in a place where I tend to believe what

1:05:36.940 --> 1:05:39.720
 police officers say, that's just how I grew up.

1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:46.460
 But if the judge is telling me that I have to listen to every witness equally, then I'll

1:05:46.460 --> 1:05:52.300
 do my best and I won't weigh that testimony any higher than I would any other testimony.

1:05:52.300 --> 1:05:57.300
 If you have someone answer a question like that, that sounds more sincere to me, sounds

1:05:57.300 --> 1:05:58.300
 more honest.

1:05:58.300 --> 1:06:02.060
 And if you want a person, you want a person to try to do that.

1:06:02.060 --> 1:06:07.500
 And then in closing arguments, as the lawyer, I'd say something like, ladies and gentlemen,

1:06:07.500 --> 1:06:15.300
 we chose you to be on this jury because you swore that you would do your level best to

1:06:15.300 --> 1:06:17.300
 be fair.

1:06:17.300 --> 1:06:19.420
 That's why we chose you.

1:06:19.420 --> 1:06:23.020
 And I'm confident that you're going to do that here.

1:06:23.020 --> 1:06:30.060
 So when you heard that police officer's testimony, the judge told you, you can't give more credit

1:06:30.060 --> 1:06:33.660
 to that testimony just because it's a police officer.

1:06:33.660 --> 1:06:37.660
 And I trust that you're going to do that and that you're going to look at witness number

1:06:37.660 --> 1:06:40.940
 three, you know, John Smith, you're going to look at John Smith.

1:06:40.940 --> 1:06:47.740
 John Smith has a different recollection and you're duty bound, duty bound to look at that

1:06:47.740 --> 1:06:52.940
 testimony and this person's credibility, you know, the same degree as that other witness,

1:06:52.940 --> 1:06:53.940
 right?

1:06:53.940 --> 1:06:58.540
 And now what you have is just a, he said, she said matter, and this is a criminal case

1:06:58.540 --> 1:07:01.140
 that has to be reasonable doubt, right?

1:07:01.140 --> 1:07:07.300
 So, you know, and really someone who's trying to do the right thing, it's helpful, but no,

1:07:07.300 --> 1:07:11.620
 you're not going to just find 14 people with no biases.

1:07:11.620 --> 1:07:12.620
 That's absurd.

1:07:12.620 --> 1:07:17.100
 Well, that's fascinating that, especially the way you're inspiring the way you're speaking

1:07:17.100 --> 1:07:20.220
 now is, I mean, I guess you're calling on the jury.

1:07:20.220 --> 1:07:23.940
 That's kind of the whole system is you're calling on the jury, each individual on the

1:07:23.940 --> 1:07:31.220
 jury to step up and really think, you know, to, to step up and be their most thoughtful

1:07:31.220 --> 1:07:39.020
 selves, actually, most introspective, like you're trying to basically ask people to be

1:07:39.020 --> 1:07:41.340
 their best selves.

1:07:41.340 --> 1:07:45.100
 And that's, and they, I guess a lot of people step up to that.

1:07:45.100 --> 1:07:52.820
 A lot of people do, I'm very, I'm very pro jury, juries, they, they get it right a lot

1:07:52.820 --> 1:07:58.100
 of the time, most of the time, and they really work hard to do it.

1:07:58.100 --> 1:08:02.660
 So what do you think happens?

1:08:02.660 --> 1:08:11.660
 I mean, maybe, I'm not so much on the legal side of things, but on the social side, it's

1:08:11.660 --> 1:08:17.780
 like with the O.J. Simpson trial, do you think it's possible that Derek Chauvin does not

1:08:17.780 --> 1:08:23.020
 get convicted of the, what is it, second degree murder?

1:08:23.020 --> 1:08:24.780
 How do you think about that?

1:08:24.780 --> 1:08:30.180
 How do you think about the potential social impact of that, the, the riots, the protests,

1:08:30.180 --> 1:08:37.220
 the, either, either direction, any words that are said, the tension here could be explosive,

1:08:37.220 --> 1:08:38.220
 especially with the cameras.

1:08:38.220 --> 1:08:39.220
 Yeah.

1:08:39.220 --> 1:08:44.860
 You know, so yes, there's certainly a possibility that he, he'll be acquitted.

1:08:44.860 --> 1:08:55.360
 For homicide charges, for the jury to convict, they have to make a determination as to Officer

1:08:55.360 --> 1:09:04.060
 Chauvin's, former Officer Chauvin's state of mind, whether he intended to cause some

1:09:04.060 --> 1:09:13.300
 harm, whether he was grossly reckless in causing harm, so much so that he disregarded a known

1:09:13.300 --> 1:09:16.260
 risk of death or serious bodily injury.

1:09:16.260 --> 1:09:23.620
 And as you may have read in the papers, yesterday the judge allowed a third degree murder charge

1:09:23.620 --> 1:09:33.820
 in Kentucky, which is, it's the mindset, the state of mind there is not an intention,

1:09:33.820 --> 1:09:37.220
 but it's depraved indifference.

1:09:37.220 --> 1:09:42.340
 And what that means is that the jury doesn't have to find that he intended to do anything.

1:09:42.340 --> 1:09:50.060
 Rather, they could find that he was just indifferent to a risk.

1:09:50.060 --> 1:09:51.060
 As dark.

1:09:51.060 --> 1:09:52.060
 Yeah.

1:09:52.060 --> 1:09:53.060
 Yeah.

1:09:53.060 --> 1:09:54.060
 I'm not sure what's worse.

1:09:54.060 --> 1:10:00.340
 Well, that's, that's a good point, but, but it's a, it's another basis for the jury

1:10:00.340 --> 1:10:01.340
 to convict.

1:10:01.340 --> 1:10:04.680
 But look, you never know what happens when you go to a jury trial.

1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:16.520
 So there could be an acquittal, and if there is, I imagine there would be massive protests.

1:10:16.520 --> 1:10:23.780
 If he's convicted, I don't think that would happen, because I just don't see, at least

1:10:23.780 --> 1:10:30.780
 nothing I've seen or read suggests that there's a big pro Chauvin camp out there ready to

1:10:30.780 --> 1:10:31.780
 protest.

1:10:31.780 --> 1:10:37.620
 Well, there could be a, is there also potential tensions that could arise from the sentencing?

1:10:37.620 --> 1:10:41.620
 I don't know how that exactly works, sort of not enough years kind of thing.

1:10:41.620 --> 1:10:42.620
 Yeah, it could be.

1:10:42.620 --> 1:10:43.620
 All that kind of stuff.

1:10:43.620 --> 1:10:44.620
 It could be.

1:10:44.620 --> 1:10:45.620
 I mean, it's, a lot could happen.

1:10:45.620 --> 1:10:49.660
 So it depends on what he's convicted of, you know, one count I think is like up to

1:10:49.660 --> 1:10:52.820
 10 years, another counts up to 40 years.

1:10:52.820 --> 1:10:57.560
 So it depends what he's convicted of, and yes, it depends on how much of the, how much

1:10:57.560 --> 1:11:01.980
 time the judge gives him if he is convicted.

1:11:01.980 --> 1:11:07.560
 There's a lot of space for people to be very angry, and so we will see what happens.

1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:15.620
 I just feel like with a judge and the lawyers, there's an opportunity to have really important

1:11:15.620 --> 1:11:17.980
 long lasting speeches.

1:11:17.980 --> 1:11:23.280
 I don't know if they think of it that way, especially with the cameras.

1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:29.940
 It feels like they have the capacity to heal or to divide.

1:11:29.940 --> 1:11:35.940
 Do you ever think about that as a lawyer, as a legal mind, that your words aren't just

1:11:35.940 --> 1:11:42.820
 about the case, but about the, they'll reverberate through history potentially?

1:11:42.820 --> 1:11:49.340
 That is, that is certainly a possible consequence of things you say.

1:11:49.340 --> 1:11:55.500
 I don't think that most lawyers think about that in the context of the case.

1:11:55.500 --> 1:11:58.180
 Your role is much more narrow.

1:11:58.180 --> 1:12:04.700
 You're the partisan advocate, as a defense lawyer, partisan advocate for that client.

1:12:04.700 --> 1:12:11.780
 As a prosecutor, you're a minister of justice attempting to prosecute that particular case.

1:12:11.780 --> 1:12:19.280
 But the reality is you are absolutely correct that sometimes the things you say will have

1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:20.800
 a shelf life.

1:12:20.800 --> 1:12:25.900
 You mentioned O.J. Simpson before, if the glove doesn't fit, you must acquit.

1:12:25.900 --> 1:12:30.980
 It's going to be just in our lexicon for probably a long time now.

1:12:30.980 --> 1:12:36.700
 So it happens, but that's not, and shouldn't be foremost on your mind.

1:12:36.700 --> 1:12:37.700
 Right.

1:12:37.700 --> 1:12:41.420
 What do you make of the O.J. Simpson trial?

1:12:41.420 --> 1:12:44.400
 Do you have thoughts about it?

1:12:44.400 --> 1:12:48.520
 He's out and about on social media now, he's a public figure.

1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:51.580
 Is there lessons to be drawn from that whole saga?

1:12:51.580 --> 1:12:53.820
 Well, you know, that was an interesting case.

1:12:53.820 --> 1:12:58.960
 I was a young public defender, I want to say, in my first year as a public defender when

1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:00.420
 that verdict came out.

1:13:00.420 --> 1:13:03.180
 So that case was important in so many ways.

1:13:03.180 --> 1:13:10.900
 One, it was the first DNA case, major DNA case, and there were significant lessons learned

1:13:10.900 --> 1:13:11.900
 from that.

1:13:11.900 --> 1:13:19.800
 The second mistake that the prosecution made was that they didn't present the science

1:13:19.800 --> 1:13:25.160
 in a way that a lay jury could understand it.

1:13:25.160 --> 1:13:34.740
 And what Johnny Cochran did was he understood the science and was able to translate that

1:13:34.740 --> 1:13:43.140
 into a vocabulary that he bet that that jury understood.

1:13:43.140 --> 1:13:46.700
 So Cochran was dismissive of a lot of DNA.

1:13:46.700 --> 1:13:55.460
 They say they found such and such amount of DNA, that's just like me wiping my finger

1:13:55.460 --> 1:14:00.220
 against my nose and just that little bit of DNA.

1:14:00.220 --> 1:14:06.220
 And that was effective because the prosecution hadn't done a good job of establishing that

1:14:06.220 --> 1:14:12.100
 yes, it's microscopic, you don't need that much, yes, wiping your hand on your nose and

1:14:12.100 --> 1:14:17.120
 touching something, you can transfer a lot of DNA and that gives you good information.

1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:22.060
 But you know, it was the first time that the public generally, and that jury maybe since

1:14:22.060 --> 1:14:27.820
 high school science had heard, you know, nucleotide, I mean, it was just all these terms getting

1:14:27.820 --> 1:14:33.260
 thrown at them, but it was not weaved into a narrative.

1:14:33.260 --> 1:14:40.580
 So Cochran taught us that no matter what type of case it is, no matter what science is involved,

1:14:40.580 --> 1:14:42.620
 it's still about storytelling.

1:14:42.620 --> 1:14:53.620
 It's still about a narrative and he was great at that narrative and was consistent with

1:14:53.620 --> 1:14:56.540
 his narrative all the way out.

1:14:56.540 --> 1:15:03.100
 Another lesson that was relearned is that, you know, you never ask a question to which

1:15:03.100 --> 1:15:04.580
 you don't know the answer.

1:15:04.580 --> 1:15:09.380
 That's like trial advocacy 101.

1:15:09.380 --> 1:15:15.840
 And so when they gave O.J. Simpson the glove and it wouldn't fit, you know, you don't do

1:15:15.840 --> 1:15:18.220
 things where you just don't know how it's going to turn out.

1:15:18.220 --> 1:15:25.700
 It was way, way too risky and I think that's what acquitted him because the glove just

1:15:25.700 --> 1:15:32.540
 wouldn't fit and he got to do this and ham in front of the camera and all of that and

1:15:32.540 --> 1:15:33.540
 it was big.

1:15:33.540 --> 1:15:37.540
 Do you think about, do you think about representation as a storytelling, like you, yourself and

1:15:37.540 --> 1:15:38.540
 your role?

1:15:38.540 --> 1:15:39.540
 Absolutely.

1:15:39.540 --> 1:15:40.540
 Absolutely.

1:15:40.540 --> 1:15:41.540
 We tell stories.

1:15:41.540 --> 1:15:43.860
 It is fundamental.

1:15:43.860 --> 1:15:51.180
 We, since time immemorial, we have told stories to help us make sense of the world around

1:15:51.180 --> 1:15:52.180
 us.

1:15:52.180 --> 1:16:03.220
 As a scientist, you tell a different type of story, but we as a public have told stories

1:16:03.220 --> 1:16:09.700
 from time immemorial to help us make sense of the physical and the natural world and

1:16:09.700 --> 1:16:15.300
 we are still a species that is moved by storytelling.

1:16:15.300 --> 1:16:19.020
 So that's first and last in trial work.

1:16:19.020 --> 1:16:22.420
 You have to tell a good story.

1:16:22.420 --> 1:16:28.940
 And you know, the basic introductory books about trial work teach young students, young

1:16:28.940 --> 1:16:35.940
 students and young lawyers to start an opening with this case is about, this case is about

1:16:35.940 --> 1:16:38.960
 and then you fill in the blank and you know, that's your narrative.

1:16:38.960 --> 1:16:41.580
 That's the narrative you're going to, you're going to tell.

1:16:41.580 --> 1:16:47.560
 And of course you can do the ultra dramatic, the glove doesn't fit kind of the climax and

1:16:47.560 --> 1:16:49.620
 all those kinds of things.

1:16:49.620 --> 1:16:50.620
 Yes.

1:16:50.620 --> 1:16:51.620
 But that's the best of narratives.

1:16:51.620 --> 1:16:52.620
 Yes.

1:16:52.620 --> 1:16:53.620
 The best of stories.

1:16:53.620 --> 1:16:54.620
 Yes.

1:16:54.620 --> 1:16:59.660
 Speaking of other really powerful stories that you were involved with is the Aaron Hernandez

1:16:59.660 --> 1:17:03.540
 trial and the whole story, the whole legal case.

1:17:03.540 --> 1:17:09.300
 Can you maybe overview the big picture story and legal case of Aaron Hernandez?

1:17:09.300 --> 1:17:10.300
 Yeah.

1:17:10.300 --> 1:17:20.420
 Aaron, whom I miss a lot, so he was charged with a double murder in the case that I tried.

1:17:20.420 --> 1:17:26.780
 And this was a unique case and one of those impossible cases in part because Aaron had

1:17:26.780 --> 1:17:31.020
 already been convicted of a murder.

1:17:31.020 --> 1:17:36.420
 And so we had a client who was on trial for a double murder after having already been

1:17:36.420 --> 1:17:40.060
 convicted of a separate murder.

1:17:40.060 --> 1:17:48.480
 And we had a jury pool just about all of whom knew that he had been convicted of a murder

1:17:48.480 --> 1:17:54.180
 because he was a very popular football player in Boston, which is a big football town with

1:17:54.180 --> 1:17:55.940
 the Patriots.

1:17:55.940 --> 1:18:02.800
 So everyone knew that he was a convicted murderer and here we are defending for in a double

1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:04.980
 murder case.

1:18:04.980 --> 1:18:07.820
 So that was the context.

1:18:07.820 --> 1:18:15.680
 It was an odd case in the sense that this murder had gone unsolved for a couple of years

1:18:15.680 --> 1:18:27.020
 and then a nightclub bouncer said something to a cop who was working at a club that Aaron

1:18:27.020 --> 1:18:32.300
 Hernandez was somehow involved in that murder that happened in the theater district.

1:18:32.300 --> 1:18:37.340
 That's the district where all the clubs are in Boston and where the homicide occurred.

1:18:37.340 --> 1:18:46.740
 And once the police heard Aaron Hernandez's name, then they went all out in order to do

1:18:46.740 --> 1:18:47.740
 this.

1:18:47.740 --> 1:19:01.100
 They found a guy named Alexander Bradley, who was a very significant drug dealer in

1:19:01.100 --> 1:19:09.260
 the sort of Connecticut area, very significant, very powerful.

1:19:09.260 --> 1:19:17.620
 And he essentially, in exchange for a deal, pointed to Aaron and said, yeah, I was with

1:19:17.620 --> 1:19:24.080
 Aaron and Aaron was the murderer.

1:19:24.080 --> 1:19:25.860
 So that's how the case came to court.

1:19:25.860 --> 1:19:26.860
 Okay.

1:19:26.860 --> 1:19:28.380
 So that sets the context.

1:19:28.380 --> 1:19:36.820
 What was your involvement in this case, like legally, intellectually, psychologically,

1:19:36.820 --> 1:19:40.540
 when this particular second charge of murder?

1:19:40.540 --> 1:19:49.940
 So a friend called me, Jose Baez, who is a defense attorney, and he comes to a class

1:19:49.940 --> 1:19:57.040
 that I teach every year at Harvard, the trial advocacy workshop, as one of my teaching faculty

1:19:57.040 --> 1:19:58.620
 members.

1:19:58.620 --> 1:20:02.440
 It's a class where we teach students how to try cases.

1:20:02.440 --> 1:20:12.600
 So Jose called me and said, hey, I got a call from Massachusetts, Aaron Hernandez.

1:20:12.600 --> 1:20:15.720
 You want to go and talk to him with me?

1:20:15.720 --> 1:20:16.720
 So I said, sure.

1:20:16.720 --> 1:20:26.500
 So we went up to the prison and met Aaron and spoke with him for two or three hours

1:20:26.500 --> 1:20:27.740
 that first time.

1:20:27.740 --> 1:20:32.340
 And before we left, he said he wanted to retain us.

1:20:32.340 --> 1:20:33.660
 He wanted to work with us.

1:20:33.660 --> 1:20:34.980
 And that started the representation.

1:20:34.980 --> 1:20:39.140
 What was he like in that time?

1:20:39.140 --> 1:20:42.020
 What was he worn down by the whole process?

1:20:42.020 --> 1:20:44.340
 Was there still a light in that?

1:20:44.340 --> 1:20:45.340
 He was not.

1:20:45.340 --> 1:20:49.700
 He had, I mean, more than just a light, he was luminous almost.

1:20:49.700 --> 1:20:55.540
 He had a radiant million dollar smile whenever you walked in.

1:20:55.540 --> 1:21:00.960
 My first impression I distinctly remember was, wow, this is what a professional athlete

1:21:00.960 --> 1:21:01.960
 looks like.

1:21:01.960 --> 1:21:09.180
 I mean, he walked in and he's just bigger and more fit than anyone anywhere.

1:21:09.180 --> 1:21:10.780
 And it's like, wow.

1:21:10.780 --> 1:21:13.940
 And when you saw him on television, he looked kind of little.

1:21:13.940 --> 1:21:21.740
 And I remember thinking, well, what do those other guys look like in person?

1:21:21.740 --> 1:21:32.820
 And he's extraordinarily polite, young, I was surprised by how young he was.

1:21:32.820 --> 1:21:36.300
 Both in mind and body.

1:21:36.300 --> 1:21:42.020
 Chronologically, I was thinking he was in his early 20s, I believe.

1:21:42.020 --> 1:21:46.180
 But there seemed to be like an innocence to him in terms of just the way he saw the world.

1:21:46.180 --> 1:21:47.740
 I think that's right.

1:21:47.740 --> 1:21:50.820
 They picked that up from the documentary, just taking that in.

1:21:50.820 --> 1:21:53.560
 I think that's right, yeah, yeah.

1:21:53.560 --> 1:22:01.180
 So there is a Netflix documentary titled Killer Inside the Mind of Aaron Hernandez.

1:22:01.180 --> 1:22:02.460
 What are your thoughts on this documentary?

1:22:02.460 --> 1:22:04.980
 I don't know if you've gotten a chance to see it.

1:22:04.980 --> 1:22:05.980
 I have not seen it.

1:22:05.980 --> 1:22:07.180
 I did not participate in it.

1:22:07.180 --> 1:22:13.500
 I know I was in it because there was news footage, but I did not participate in it.

1:22:13.500 --> 1:22:22.340
 I had not talked to Aaron about press or anything before he died.

1:22:22.340 --> 1:22:25.860
 My strong view is that the attorney client privilege survives death.

1:22:25.860 --> 1:22:29.860
 And so I was not inclined to talk about anything that Aaron and I talked about.

1:22:29.860 --> 1:22:34.260
 So I just didn't participate and have never watched it.

1:22:34.260 --> 1:22:36.820
 Not even watch, huh?

1:22:36.820 --> 1:22:42.300
 Does that apply to most of your work, do you try to stay away from the way the press perceives

1:22:42.300 --> 1:22:43.300
 stuff?

1:22:43.300 --> 1:22:46.540
 Well, during, yes, I try to stay away from it.

1:22:46.540 --> 1:22:48.700
 I will view it afterwards.

1:22:48.700 --> 1:22:53.660
 I just hadn't gotten around to watching Aaron, because it's kind of sad.

1:22:53.660 --> 1:22:55.180
 So I just haven't watched it.

1:22:55.180 --> 1:23:00.340
 But I definitely stay away from the press during trial.

1:23:00.340 --> 1:23:06.700
 And there are some lawyers who watch it religiously to see what's going on, but I'm confident

1:23:06.700 --> 1:23:15.820
 in my years of training and so forth that I can actively sense what's going on in the

1:23:15.820 --> 1:23:26.820
 courtroom and that I really don't need advice from Joe476 at Gmail, some random guy on the

1:23:26.820 --> 1:23:29.140
 internet telling me how to try cases.

1:23:29.140 --> 1:23:33.340
 So to me, it's just confusing and I just keep it out of my mind.

1:23:33.340 --> 1:23:38.220
 And even if you think you can ignore it, just reading it will have a little bit of an effect

1:23:38.220 --> 1:23:39.220
 on your mind.

1:23:39.220 --> 1:23:40.700
 I think that's right.

1:23:40.700 --> 1:23:43.980
 Over time it might accumulate.

1:23:43.980 --> 1:23:54.700
 So the documentary, but in general, it mentioned or kind of emphasized and talked about Aaron's

1:23:54.700 --> 1:24:03.300
 sexuality or sort of they were discussing basically the idea that he was a homosexual.

1:24:03.300 --> 1:24:10.500
 And some of the trauma, some of the suffering that he endured in his life had to do with

1:24:10.500 --> 1:24:18.900
 sort of fear given the society of what his father would think of what others around him

1:24:18.900 --> 1:24:23.060
 sort of, especially in sport culture and football and so on.

1:24:23.060 --> 1:24:31.180
 So I don't know in your interaction with him was, do you think that maybe even leaning

1:24:31.180 --> 1:24:38.820
 up to a suicide, do you think his struggle with coming to terms with the sexuality had

1:24:38.820 --> 1:24:43.620
 a role to play in much of his difficulties?

1:24:43.620 --> 1:24:50.940
 Well I'm not going to talk about my interactions with them and anything I derived from that.

1:24:50.940 --> 1:25:04.500
 But what I will say is that a story broke on the radio at some point during the trial

1:25:04.500 --> 1:25:11.460
 that Aaron had been in the same sex relationship with someone and some local sportscasters,

1:25:11.460 --> 1:25:18.940
 local Boston sportscasters really mushroomed the story.

1:25:18.940 --> 1:25:25.980
 So he and everyone was aware of it.

1:25:25.980 --> 1:25:36.380
 You also may know from the court record that the prosecutors floated a specious theory

1:25:36.380 --> 1:25:43.420
 for a minute but then backed off of it that Aaron was, that there was some sort of I guess

1:25:43.420 --> 1:25:51.260
 gay rage at work with him and that might be a cause, a motive for the killing.

1:25:51.260 --> 1:25:54.060
 And luckily they really backed off of that.

1:25:54.060 --> 1:25:58.620
 That was quite an offensive claim in theory.

1:25:58.620 --> 1:26:04.700
 So but to answer your question more directly, I mean I have no idea why he killed himself.

1:26:04.700 --> 1:26:08.540
 It was a surprise and a shock.

1:26:08.540 --> 1:26:13.060
 I was scheduled to go see him like a couple days after it happened.

1:26:13.060 --> 1:26:22.780
 I mean he was anxious for Jose and I to come in and do the appeal from the murder which

1:26:22.780 --> 1:26:23.840
 he was convicted for.

1:26:23.840 --> 1:26:27.720
 He wanted us to take over that appeal.

1:26:27.720 --> 1:26:29.500
 He was talking about going back to football.

1:26:29.500 --> 1:26:34.420
 I mean he said, well you talk about this, earlier you talked about the sort of innocent

1:26:34.420 --> 1:26:35.420
 aspect of him.

1:26:35.420 --> 1:26:40.580
 He said, you know, well Ron, maybe not the Patriots but you know, I want to get back

1:26:40.580 --> 1:26:47.580
 in the league and I was like, you know, Aaron, that's going to be tough, man.

1:26:47.580 --> 1:26:56.420
 But he really believed it and then for a few days later that to happen, it was a real shock

1:26:56.420 --> 1:26:57.420
 to me.

1:26:57.420 --> 1:27:04.660
 Like when you look back at that, at his story, does it make you sad?

1:27:04.660 --> 1:27:05.660
 Very.

1:27:05.660 --> 1:27:06.660
 Very.

1:27:06.660 --> 1:27:16.620
 I thought, so one, I believe he absolutely did not commit the crimes that we acquitted

1:27:16.620 --> 1:27:17.620
 him on.

1:27:17.620 --> 1:27:23.660
 I think that was the right answer for that.

1:27:23.660 --> 1:27:29.980
 I don't know enough about Bradley, the first case, I'm sorry, to make an opinion on.

1:27:29.980 --> 1:27:39.020
 But in our case, it was just, he had the misfortune of having a famous name and the police department

1:27:39.020 --> 1:27:44.340
 just really got on him there.

1:27:44.340 --> 1:27:52.300
 So yes, I miss him a lot, it was very, very sad and surprising.

1:27:52.300 --> 1:27:57.220
 And I mean just on the human side, of course we don't know the full story, but just everything

1:27:57.220 --> 1:28:04.180
 that led up to suicide, everything led up to an incredible professional football player,

1:28:04.180 --> 1:28:06.180
 you know, that whole story.

1:28:06.180 --> 1:28:10.760
 He was a remarkably talented athlete, remarkably talented athlete.

1:28:10.760 --> 1:28:16.220
 And it has to do with all the possible trajectories, right, that we can take through life, as we

1:28:16.220 --> 1:28:17.820
 were talking about before.

1:28:17.820 --> 1:28:23.940
 And some of them lead to suicide, sadly enough.

1:28:23.940 --> 1:28:34.060
 And it's always tragic when you have somebody with great potential result in the things

1:28:34.060 --> 1:28:35.900
 that happen.

1:28:35.900 --> 1:28:37.700
 People love it when I ask about books.

1:28:37.700 --> 1:28:44.980
 I don't know whether technical, like legal or fiction, nonfiction books throughout your

1:28:44.980 --> 1:28:50.380
 life have had an impact on you, if there's something you could recommend or something

1:28:50.380 --> 1:28:57.860
 you could speak to about something that inspired ideas, insights about this complicated world

1:28:57.860 --> 1:28:58.860
 of ours.

1:28:58.860 --> 1:28:59.860
 Oh, wow.

1:28:59.860 --> 1:29:05.540
 Yeah, so I'll give you a couple.

1:29:05.540 --> 1:29:09.900
 So one is Contingency, Irony and Solidarity by Richard Warty.

1:29:09.900 --> 1:29:18.820
 He's passed away now, but was a philosopher at some of our major institutions, Princeton,

1:29:18.820 --> 1:29:23.300
 Stanford.

1:29:23.300 --> 1:29:30.260
 Contingency, Irony and Solidarity, at least that's a book that really helped me work through

1:29:30.260 --> 1:29:31.480
 a series of thoughts.

1:29:31.480 --> 1:29:40.940
 So it stands for the proposition that our most deeply held beliefs are contingent, that

1:29:40.940 --> 1:29:48.300
 there's nothing beyond history or prior to socialization that's definatory of the human

1:29:48.300 --> 1:29:50.980
 being, that's Warty.

1:29:50.980 --> 1:29:58.060
 And he says that our most deeply held beliefs are received wisdom and highly contingent

1:29:58.060 --> 1:30:01.940
 along a number of registers.

1:30:01.940 --> 1:30:10.060
 And he does that, but then goes on to say that he nonetheless can hold strongly held

1:30:10.060 --> 1:30:15.140
 beliefs, recognizing their contingency, but still believes them to be true and accurate.

1:30:15.140 --> 1:30:23.660
 He helps you to work through what could be an intellectual tension, other words, so you

1:30:23.660 --> 1:30:30.100
 don't delve into, one doesn't delve into relativism, everything is okay, but he gives

1:30:30.100 --> 1:30:38.100
 you a vocabulary to think about how to negotiate these realities.

1:30:38.100 --> 1:30:40.100
 Do you share this tension?

1:30:40.100 --> 1:30:41.820
 I mean, there is a real tension.

1:30:41.820 --> 1:30:48.620
 It seems like even the law, the legal system is all just a construct of our human ideas,

1:30:48.620 --> 1:30:57.820
 and yet it seems to be, almost feels fundamental to what a just society is.

1:30:57.820 --> 1:31:06.800
 Yeah, I definitely share the tension and love his vocabulary and the way he's helped me

1:31:06.800 --> 1:31:09.000
 resolve the tension.

1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:15.300
 So right, I mean, yeah, so like, you know, infanticide, for example.

1:31:15.300 --> 1:31:23.220
 Perhaps it's socially contingent, perhaps it's received wisdom, perhaps it's anthropological,

1:31:23.220 --> 1:31:29.400
 you know, we need to propagate the species, and I still think it's wrong.

1:31:29.400 --> 1:31:37.620
 And Warty has helped me develop a category to say that, no, I can't provide any, in

1:31:37.620 --> 1:31:42.940
 Warty's words, noncircular theoretical backup for this proposition.

1:31:42.940 --> 1:31:48.180
 At some point, it's going to run me into a circularity problem, but that's okay.

1:31:48.180 --> 1:31:54.860
 I hold this nonetheless in full recognition of its contingency, but what it does is makes

1:31:54.860 --> 1:32:02.540
 you humble, and when you're humble, that's good because, you know, this notion that ideas

1:32:02.540 --> 1:32:10.580
 are always already in progress, never fully formed, I think is the sort of intellectual

1:32:10.580 --> 1:32:12.620
 I strive to be.

1:32:12.620 --> 1:32:20.980
 And if I have a sufficient degree of humility that I don't have the final answer, capital

1:32:20.980 --> 1:32:26.660
 A, then that's going to help me to get to better answers, lowercase a.

1:32:26.660 --> 1:32:33.520
 And Warty does that, and he talks about in the solidarity part of the book, he has this

1:32:33.520 --> 1:32:42.660
 concept of imaginative, the imaginative ability to see other different people as we instead

1:32:42.660 --> 1:32:43.900
 of they.

1:32:43.900 --> 1:32:47.620
 And I just think it's a beautiful concept, but he talks about this imaginative ability

1:32:47.620 --> 1:32:49.860
 and it's this active process.

1:32:49.860 --> 1:32:58.980
 So I mean, so that's a book that's done a lot of work for me over the years.

1:32:58.980 --> 1:33:06.820
 Souls of Black Folk by W. E. B. Du Bois was absolutely pivotal in my intellectual development.

1:33:06.820 --> 1:33:18.180
 One of the premier set of essays in the Western literary tradition, and it's a deep and profound

1:33:18.180 --> 1:33:28.420
 sociological, philosophical, and historical analysis of the predicament of blacks in America

1:33:28.420 --> 1:33:36.060
 from one of our country's greatest polymaths.

1:33:36.060 --> 1:33:40.780
 It's a beautiful text and I go to it yearly.

1:33:40.780 --> 1:33:46.740
 So for somebody like me, so growing up in the Soviet Union, the struggle, the civil

1:33:46.740 --> 1:33:53.380
 rights movement, the struggle of race, and all those kinds of things that is, you know,

1:33:53.380 --> 1:33:57.340
 this universal, but it's also very much a journey of the United States.

1:33:57.340 --> 1:34:00.820
 It was kind of a foreign thing that I stepped into.

1:34:00.820 --> 1:34:06.780
 Is that something you would recommend somebody like me to read, or is there other things

1:34:06.780 --> 1:34:11.140
 about race that are good to connect to?

1:34:11.140 --> 1:34:17.140
 My flavor of suffering injustice, I'm a Jew as well, my flavor has to do with World War

1:34:17.140 --> 1:34:20.820
 II and the studies of that, you know, all the injustices there.

1:34:20.820 --> 1:34:27.340
 So I'm now stepping into a new set of injustices and trying to learn the landscape.

1:34:27.340 --> 1:34:35.100
 I would say anyone is a better person for having read Du Bois.

1:34:35.100 --> 1:34:42.860
 He's just a remarkable writer and thinker, and to the extent you're interested in learning

1:34:42.860 --> 1:34:49.460
 another history, he does it in a way that is quite sophisticated.

1:34:49.460 --> 1:34:54.980
 So it's interesting, I was going to give you three books.

1:34:54.980 --> 1:35:00.900
 I noted the accent when I met you, but I didn't know exactly where you're from.

1:35:00.900 --> 1:35:07.660
 But the other book I was going to say is Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment, and I mean, I've always

1:35:07.660 --> 1:35:14.340
 wanted to go to St. Pete's just to sort of see with my own eyes what the word pictures

1:35:14.340 --> 1:35:18.740
 that Dostoevsky created in Crime and Punishment.

1:35:18.740 --> 1:35:23.480
 And you know, I love others of his stuff too, The Brothers Care, Masov, and so forth.

1:35:23.480 --> 1:35:30.980
 But Crime and Punishment I first read in high school as a junior or senior, and it is a

1:35:30.980 --> 1:35:40.740
 deep and profound meditation on both the meaning and the measure of our lives.

1:35:40.740 --> 1:35:53.940
 And Dostoevsky, obviously in conversation with other thinkers, really gets at the crux

1:35:53.940 --> 1:36:01.500
 of a fundamental philosophical problem, what does it mean to be a human being?

1:36:01.500 --> 1:36:07.340
 And for that, Crime and Punishment captured me as a teenager, and that's another text

1:36:07.340 --> 1:36:10.860
 that I return to often.

1:36:10.860 --> 1:36:17.060
 We've talked about young people a little bit at the beginning of our conversation.

1:36:17.060 --> 1:36:23.340
 Is there advice that you could give to a young person today thinking about their career,

1:36:23.340 --> 1:36:28.180
 thinking about their life, thinking about making their way in this world?

1:36:28.180 --> 1:36:29.180
 Yeah, sure.

1:36:29.180 --> 1:36:30.420
 I'll share some advice.

1:36:30.420 --> 1:36:36.480
 It actually picks up on a question we talked about earlier in the academy and schools.

1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:42.940
 But it's some advice that a professor gave to me when I got to Harvard.

1:36:42.940 --> 1:36:48.560
 And it is this, that you have to be willing to come face to face with your intellectual

1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:52.860
 limitations and keep going.

1:36:52.860 --> 1:37:01.140
 And it's hard for people, I mean, you mentioned this earlier, to face really difficult tasks,

1:37:01.140 --> 1:37:05.620
 and particularly in these sort of elite spaces where you've excelled all your life, and

1:37:05.620 --> 1:37:09.300
 you come to MIT and you're like, wait a minute, I don't understand this.

1:37:09.300 --> 1:37:10.500
 Wait, this is hard.

1:37:10.500 --> 1:37:14.460
 I've never had something really hard before.

1:37:14.460 --> 1:37:19.660
 And there are a couple options, and a lot of people will pull back and take the gentleman

1:37:19.660 --> 1:37:28.060
 or gentlewoman's bee and just go on, or risk going out there, giving it your all, and still

1:37:28.060 --> 1:37:29.940
 not quite getting it.

1:37:29.940 --> 1:37:35.940
 And that's a risk, but it's a risk well worth it, because you're just going to be the better

1:37:35.940 --> 1:37:38.580
 person, the better student for it.

1:37:38.580 --> 1:37:45.820
 And even outside of the academy, I mean, come face to face with your fears and keep going

1:37:45.820 --> 1:37:51.500
 and keep going in life, and you're going to be the better person, the better human being.

1:37:51.500 --> 1:37:57.700
 Yeah, it does seem to be, I don't know what it is, but it does seem to be that fear is

1:37:57.700 --> 1:38:05.380
 a good indicator of something you should probably face.

1:38:05.380 --> 1:38:08.140
 Fear kind of shows the way a little bit.

1:38:08.140 --> 1:38:09.140
 Not always.

1:38:09.140 --> 1:38:16.260
 You might not want to go into the cage with a lion, but maybe you should.

1:38:16.260 --> 1:38:17.260
 Maybe.

1:38:17.260 --> 1:38:22.780
 Let me ask sort of a darker question, because we're talking about Dostoyevsky, we might

1:38:22.780 --> 1:38:25.460
 as well.

1:38:25.460 --> 1:38:36.380
 Do you, and connected to the freeing innocent people, do you think about mortality?

1:38:36.380 --> 1:38:38.020
 Do you think about your own death?

1:38:38.020 --> 1:38:40.340
 Are you afraid of death?

1:38:40.340 --> 1:38:42.180
 I'm not afraid of death.

1:38:42.180 --> 1:38:48.920
 I do think about it more now, because I'm now in my mid fifties, so I used to not think

1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:57.460
 about it much at all, but the harsh reality is that I've got more time behind me now

1:38:57.460 --> 1:39:01.220
 than I do in front of me, and it kind of happens all of a sudden, too.

1:39:01.220 --> 1:39:08.860
 You realize, wait a minute, I'm actually on the back nine now, so yeah, my mind moves

1:39:08.860 --> 1:39:10.140
 to it from time to time.

1:39:10.140 --> 1:39:11.860
 I don't dwell on it.

1:39:11.860 --> 1:39:14.160
 I'm not afraid of it.

1:39:14.160 --> 1:39:21.660
 My own personal religious commitments, I'm Christian, and my religious commitments buoy

1:39:21.660 --> 1:39:31.260
 me that death, and I believe this, death is not the end, so I'm not afraid of it.

1:39:31.260 --> 1:39:35.780
 Now, this is not to say that I want to rush to the afterlife.

1:39:35.780 --> 1:39:42.820
 I'm good right here for a long time, and I hope I've got 30, 35, 40 more years to

1:39:42.820 --> 1:39:50.100
 go, but no, I don't fear death.

1:39:50.100 --> 1:39:52.380
 We're finite creatures.

1:39:52.380 --> 1:39:53.380
 We're all gonna die.

1:39:53.380 --> 1:40:01.500
 Well, the mystery of it, you know, for somebody, at least for me, we human beings want to figure

1:40:01.500 --> 1:40:04.300
 everything out.

1:40:04.300 --> 1:40:08.220
 Whatever the afterlife is, there's still a mystery to it.

1:40:08.220 --> 1:40:17.540
 That uncertainty can be terrifying if you ponder it, but maybe what you're saying is

1:40:17.540 --> 1:40:21.340
 you haven't pondered it too deeply so far, and it's worked out pretty good.

1:40:21.340 --> 1:40:24.500
 It's worked out, yeah, no complaints.

1:40:24.500 --> 1:40:32.220
 So you said, again, the Sejewski kind of was exceptionally good at getting to the core

1:40:32.220 --> 1:40:34.180
 of what it means to be human.

1:40:34.180 --> 1:40:41.660
 Do you think about, like, the why of why we're here, the meaning of this whole existence?

1:40:41.660 --> 1:40:50.140
 Yeah, no, I do, I think, and I actually think that's the purpose of an education.

1:40:50.140 --> 1:40:51.860
 What does it mean to be a human being?

1:40:51.860 --> 1:40:58.220
 And in one way or another, we set out to answer those questions, and we do it in a different

1:40:58.220 --> 1:40:59.220
 way.

1:40:59.220 --> 1:41:07.340
 I mean, some may look to philosophy to answer these questions.

1:41:07.340 --> 1:41:17.020
 Why is it in one's personal interest to do good, to do justice?

1:41:17.020 --> 1:41:22.900
 Some may look at it through the economist lens.

1:41:22.900 --> 1:41:32.980
 Some may look at it through the microscope in the laboratory that the phenomenal world

1:41:32.980 --> 1:41:36.580
 is the meaning of life.

1:41:36.580 --> 1:41:44.500
 Others may say that that's one vocabulary, that's one description, but the poet describes

1:41:44.500 --> 1:41:51.320
 a reality to the same degree as a physicist, but that's the purpose of an education.

1:41:51.320 --> 1:41:53.860
 It's to sort of work through these issues.

1:41:53.860 --> 1:41:59.340
 What does it mean to be a human being?

1:41:59.340 --> 1:42:04.260
 And I think it's a fascinating journey, and I think it's a lifelong endeavor to figure

1:42:04.260 --> 1:42:09.220
 out what is the thing, that nugget, that makes us human.

1:42:09.220 --> 1:42:11.780
 Do you still see yourself as a student?

1:42:11.780 --> 1:42:12.780
 Of course.

1:42:12.780 --> 1:42:13.780
 Yes.

1:42:13.780 --> 1:42:19.460
 I mean, that's the best part about going into university teaching.

1:42:19.460 --> 1:42:20.880
 You're a lifelong student.

1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:21.880
 I'm always learning.

1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:27.380
 I learn from my students and with my students and my colleagues.

1:42:27.380 --> 1:42:33.860
 You continue to read and learn and modify opinions, and I think it's just a wonderful

1:42:33.860 --> 1:42:34.860
 thing.

1:42:34.860 --> 1:42:45.260
 Well, Ron, I'm so glad that somebody like you is carrying the fire of what is the best

1:42:45.260 --> 1:42:46.260
 of Harvard.

1:42:46.260 --> 1:42:50.900
 It's a huge honor that you would spend so much time, waste so much of your valuable

1:42:50.900 --> 1:42:51.900
 time with me.

1:42:51.900 --> 1:42:52.900
 I really appreciate that conversation.

1:42:52.900 --> 1:42:53.900
 Not a waste at all.

1:42:53.900 --> 1:42:55.260
 I think a lot of people love it.

1:42:55.260 --> 1:42:56.580
 Thank you so much for talking today.

1:42:56.580 --> 1:42:58.380
 Thank you.

1:42:58.380 --> 1:43:02.780
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ronald Sullivan, and thank you to Brooklyn

1:43:02.780 --> 1:43:09.100

1:43:13.540 --> 1:43:18.480
 And now let me leave you with some words from Nelson Mandela, when a man is denied the right

1:43:18.480 --> 1:43:25.620
 to live the life he believes in, he has no choice but to become an outlaw.

1:43:25.620 --> 1:43:44.500
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
