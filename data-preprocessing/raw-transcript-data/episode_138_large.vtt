00:00.000 --> 00:03.240
 The following is a conversation with Yaron Brook,

00:03.240 --> 00:05.680
 one of the best known objectivist philosophers

00:05.680 --> 00:07.240
 and thinkers in the world.

00:07.240 --> 00:11.680
 Objectivism is the philosophical system developed by Ayn Rand

00:11.680 --> 00:14.240
 that she first expressed in her fiction books,

00:14.240 --> 00:16.720
 The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged,

00:16.720 --> 00:19.840
 and later in nonfiction essays and books.

00:19.840 --> 00:22.880
 Yaron is the current chairman of the board

00:22.880 --> 00:26.800
 at the Ayn Rand Institute, host of the Yaron Brook Show,

00:26.800 --> 00:30.080
 and the coauthor of Free Market Revolution,

00:30.080 --> 00:33.360
 Equal is Unfair, and several other books

00:33.360 --> 00:37.440
 where he analyzes systems of government, human behavior,

00:37.440 --> 00:41.800
 and the human condition from the perspective of objectivism.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.320
 Quick mention of each sponsor,

00:43.320 --> 00:46.280
 followed by some thoughts related to the episode.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.120
 Blinkist, an app I use for reading

00:49.120 --> 00:51.080
 through summaries of books.

00:51.080 --> 00:54.640
 ExpressVPN, the VPN I've used for many years

00:54.640 --> 00:57.240
 to protect my privacy on the internet.

00:57.240 --> 01:01.400
 And CashApp, the app I use to send money to friends.

01:07.320 --> 01:11.040
 As a side note, let me say that I first read Atlas Shrugged

01:11.040 --> 01:13.480
 and The Fountainhead early in college,

01:13.480 --> 01:16.960
 along with many other literary and philosophical works

01:16.960 --> 01:21.280
 from Nietzsche, Heidegger, Kant, Locke, Foucault,

01:21.280 --> 01:25.120
 Wittgenstein, and of course, all the great existentialists

01:25.120 --> 01:27.640
 from Kierkegaard to Camus.

01:27.640 --> 01:30.160
 I always had an open mind, curious to learn

01:30.160 --> 01:33.040
 and explore the ideas of thinkers throughout history,

01:33.040 --> 01:36.720
 no matter how mundane or radical

01:36.720 --> 01:39.480
 or even dangerous they were considered to be.

01:40.360 --> 01:44.480
 Ayn Rand was, and I think still is, a divisive figure.

01:44.480 --> 01:46.880
 Some people love her, some people dislike

01:46.880 --> 01:49.200
 or even dismiss her.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.400
 I prefer to look past what some may consider

01:51.400 --> 01:53.720
 to be the flaws of the person

01:53.720 --> 01:57.880
 and consider with an open mind the ideas she presents

01:57.880 --> 02:00.720
 and Jaron now describes and applies

02:00.720 --> 02:02.920
 in his philosophical discussions.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.400
 In general, I hope that you will be patient

02:05.400 --> 02:09.760
 and understanding as I venture out across the space of ideas

02:09.760 --> 02:12.720
 and the ever widening Overton window,

02:12.720 --> 02:15.040
 pulling at the thread of curiosity,

02:15.040 --> 02:17.080
 sometimes saying stupid things,

02:17.080 --> 02:19.200
 but always striving to understand

02:19.200 --> 02:23.280
 how we can better build a better world together.

 And now, here's my conversation with Jaron Rook.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.560
 Let me ask the biggest possible question first.

02:42.560 --> 02:43.400
 Sure.

02:43.400 --> 02:47.280
 What are the principles of a life well lived?

02:47.280 --> 02:50.120
 I think it's to live with thought,

02:51.920 --> 02:55.920
 that is to live a rational life, to think it through.

02:55.920 --> 02:59.600
 I think so many people are in a sense zombies out there.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.880
 They're alive, but they're not really alive

03:01.880 --> 03:03.920
 because their mind is not focused,

03:03.920 --> 03:07.960
 their mind is not focused on what do I need to do

03:07.960 --> 03:10.000
 in order to live a great life?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.880
 So too many people just go through the motions

03:12.880 --> 03:16.720
 of living rather than really embrace life.

03:16.720 --> 03:19.720
 So I think the secret to living a great life

03:19.720 --> 03:22.680
 is to take it seriously.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.440
 And what it means to take it seriously

03:24.440 --> 03:26.960
 is to use the one tool that makes us human,

03:26.960 --> 03:29.040
 the one tool that provides us with all the values

03:29.040 --> 03:31.640
 that we have, our mind, our reason,

03:31.640 --> 03:34.840
 and to use it, apply it to living.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.720
 People apply it to their work,

03:36.720 --> 03:38.840
 they apply it to their math problems,

03:38.840 --> 03:41.880
 to science, to programming.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.640
 But imagine if they used that same energy,

03:43.640 --> 03:45.600
 that same focus, that same concentration

03:45.600 --> 03:48.680
 to actually living life and choosing values

03:49.560 --> 03:51.040
 that they should pursue,

03:51.880 --> 03:54.240
 that would change the world,

03:54.240 --> 03:56.160
 and it would change their lives.

03:56.160 --> 04:00.280
 Yeah, actually, I wear this silly suit and tie.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.240
 It symbolizes to me always,

04:02.240 --> 04:06.400
 it makes me feel like I'm taking the moment really seriously.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.440
 I think that's really, that's right.

04:08.440 --> 04:10.920
 And each one of us has different ways

04:10.920 --> 04:14.400
 to kind of condition our consciousness.

04:14.400 --> 04:17.720
 I'm serious now, and for you, it's a suit and tie.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.560
 It's a conditioning of your consciousness

04:19.560 --> 04:21.520
 to now I'm focused, now I'm at work,

04:21.520 --> 04:22.840
 now I'm doing my thing.

04:22.840 --> 04:23.840
 Yeah.

04:23.840 --> 04:26.000
 And I think that's terrific,

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
 and I wish everybody took that.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.040
 Look, I mean, it's a cliche, but we only live once.

04:32.040 --> 04:34.800
 Every minute of your life, you're never gonna live again.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.480
 This is really valuable.

04:36.480 --> 04:41.000
 And when people don't have that deep respect

04:41.000 --> 04:44.800
 for their own life, for their own time, for their own mind,

04:44.800 --> 04:49.120
 and if they did, again, one could only imagine,

04:49.120 --> 04:50.840
 look at how productive people are.

04:50.840 --> 04:52.560
 Look at the amazing things they produce

04:52.560 --> 04:54.520
 and they do in their work.

04:54.520 --> 04:58.480
 And if they applied that to everything, wow.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.240
 So you kind of talk about reason.

05:00.240 --> 05:05.120
 Where does the kind of existentialist idea

05:05.120 --> 05:10.120
 of experience maybe, fully experiencing all the moments

05:10.560 --> 05:13.720
 versus fully thinking through?

05:14.640 --> 05:17.760
 Is there an interesting line to separate the two?

05:17.760 --> 05:21.800
 Why such an emphasis on reason for a life well lived

05:21.800 --> 05:26.480
 versus just enjoy, like experience the moment?

05:26.480 --> 05:28.360
 Well, because I think experience in a sense

05:28.360 --> 05:31.480
 is the easy part.

05:31.480 --> 05:36.480
 I'm not saying it's how we experience the life that we live.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
 And yes, I'm all with the take time to value what you value,

05:43.240 --> 05:46.680
 but I don't think that's the problem of people out there.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.640
 I don't think the problem is they're not taking time

05:48.640 --> 05:51.080
 to appreciate where they are and what they do.

05:51.080 --> 05:53.360
 I think it's that they don't use their mind

05:53.360 --> 05:57.800
 in this one respect, in planning their life,

05:57.800 --> 06:00.080
 in thinking about how to live.

06:00.080 --> 06:02.360
 So the focus is on reason is because

06:02.360 --> 06:03.880
 it's our only source of knowledge.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.240
 There's no other source of knowledge.

06:05.240 --> 06:10.080
 We don't know anything that does not come

06:10.080 --> 06:12.480
 from our senses and our mind,

06:12.480 --> 06:15.200
 the integration of the evidence of our senses.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.680
 Now we know stuff about ourselves

06:16.680 --> 06:18.280
 and I think it's important to know oneself

06:18.280 --> 06:19.720
 through introspection.

06:19.720 --> 06:24.720
 And I consider that part of reasoning is to introspect.

06:25.640 --> 06:29.840
 But I think reason is undervalued, which is funny to say,

06:29.840 --> 06:31.360
 because it's our means of survival.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.000
 It's how human beings survive.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.720
 We cannot, see, this is why I disagree

06:35.720 --> 06:38.600
 with so many scientists and people like Sam Harris.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.560
 You mentioned Sam Harris before the show.

06:42.440 --> 06:46.120
 We're not programmed to know how to hunt.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.040
 We're not programmed to do agriculture.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.640
 We're not programmed to build computers

06:51.640 --> 06:53.880
 and build networks on which we can podcast

06:53.880 --> 06:55.320
 and do our shows.

06:55.320 --> 06:58.080
 All of that requires effort.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.720
 It requires focus.

06:59.720 --> 07:03.360
 It requires energy and it requires will.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.840
 It requires somebody to will it.

07:05.840 --> 07:08.560
 It requires somebody to choose it.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.200
 And once you make that choice,

07:11.200 --> 07:13.560
 you have to engage that choice means

07:13.560 --> 07:15.960
 that you're choosing to engage your reason

07:15.960 --> 07:19.240
 in discovery, in integration,

07:19.240 --> 07:23.120
 and then in work to change the world in which we live.

07:23.120 --> 07:26.400
 And human beings have to discover,

07:26.400 --> 07:29.120
 figure out, solve the problem of hunting.

07:29.120 --> 07:31.640
 Hunting, everybody thinks, oh, that's easy.

07:31.640 --> 07:32.680
 I've seen the movie.

07:32.680 --> 07:36.280
 But human beings had to figure out how to do it, right?

07:36.280 --> 07:40.760
 You can't run down a bison and bite into it, right?

07:40.760 --> 07:41.600
 You're not gonna catch it.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.120
 You're not gonna, you have no fangs to bite into it.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.560
 You have to build weapons.

07:45.560 --> 07:46.440
 You have to build tools.

07:46.440 --> 07:47.680
 You have to create traps.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.520
 You have to have a strategy.

07:49.520 --> 07:50.920
 All of that requires reason.

07:52.040 --> 07:56.520
 So the most important thing that allows human beings

07:56.520 --> 07:58.800
 to survive and to thrive in every value

07:58.800 --> 08:01.400
 from the most simple to the most sophisticated,

08:01.400 --> 08:04.600
 from the most material to, I believe, the most spiritual,

08:04.600 --> 08:06.320
 requires thinking.

08:06.320 --> 08:10.240
 So stopping and appreciating the moment

08:10.240 --> 08:14.480
 is something that I think is relatively easy

08:14.480 --> 08:17.600
 once you have a plan, once you've thought it through,

08:17.600 --> 08:19.640
 once you know what your values are.

08:20.600 --> 08:21.920
 There is a mistake people make.

08:21.920 --> 08:25.720
 They attain their values and they don't take a moment

08:25.720 --> 08:27.800
 to savor that and to appreciate that

08:27.800 --> 08:31.360
 and to even pat themselves on the back that they did it.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.200
 But that's not what's screwing up the world.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.320
 What's screwing up the world

08:34.320 --> 08:35.800
 is that people have the wrong values

08:35.800 --> 08:37.320
 and they don't think about them

08:37.320 --> 08:39.000
 and they don't really focus on them

08:39.000 --> 08:41.520
 and they don't have a plan for their own life

08:41.520 --> 08:42.600
 and how to live it.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.320
 If we look at human nature,

08:44.320 --> 08:46.760
 you're saying the fundamental big thing

08:46.760 --> 08:49.080
 that we need to consider is our capacity,

08:49.080 --> 08:51.600
 like a capability to reason.

08:51.600 --> 08:56.600
 So to me, reason is this massive evolutionary achievement

08:56.600 --> 08:57.440
 in quotes.

08:58.960 --> 09:02.280
 If you think about any other sophisticated animal,

09:02.280 --> 09:03.840
 everything has to be coded.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.280
 Everything has to be written in the hard way.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.800
 It has to be there.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.080
 And they have to have a solution for every outcome.

09:11.080 --> 09:13.280
 And if there's no solution, the animal dies typically,

09:13.280 --> 09:15.680
 or the animal suffers in some way.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.560
 Human beings have this capacity to self program.

09:18.560 --> 09:20.280
 They have this capacity.

09:20.280 --> 09:24.320
 It's not a tabula rasa in the sense

09:24.320 --> 09:25.280
 that there's nothing there.

09:25.280 --> 09:26.880
 Obviously, we have a nature.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.200
 Obviously, our minds, our brains

09:29.200 --> 09:31.160
 are structured in a particular way.

09:31.160 --> 09:35.120
 But given that, we have the ability

09:35.120 --> 09:37.320
 to turn it on or turn it off.

09:37.320 --> 09:39.440
 We have the ability to commit suicide,

09:39.440 --> 09:43.600
 to reject our nature, to work against our interests,

09:43.600 --> 09:48.120
 not to use the tool that evolution has provided us,

09:48.120 --> 09:50.760
 which is this mind, which is reason.

09:50.760 --> 09:54.280
 So that choice, that fundamental choice,

09:54.280 --> 09:58.440
 you know, Hamlet says it, right, to be or not to be.

09:58.440 --> 10:01.880
 But to be or not to be is to think or not to think,

10:01.880 --> 10:05.880
 to engage or not to engage, to focus or not to focus.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.720
 You know, in the morning when you get up,

10:07.720 --> 10:10.560
 you kind of, you know, you're not really completely there.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.680
 You're kind of out of focus and stuff.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.880
 It requires an act of will to say,

10:14.880 --> 10:17.520
 okay, I'm awake, I've got stuff to do.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.280
 Some people never do that.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.600
 Some people live in that haze,

10:21.600 --> 10:23.440
 and they never engage that mind.

10:23.440 --> 10:26.200
 And when you're sitting and try to solve

10:26.200 --> 10:29.400
 a complex computer problem or math problem,

10:29.400 --> 10:31.920
 you have to turn something on.

10:31.920 --> 10:36.160
 You have to, in a sense, exert certain energy

10:36.160 --> 10:38.080
 to focus on the problem to do it.

10:38.080 --> 10:41.160
 And that is not determined in a sense

10:41.160 --> 10:43.160
 that you have to focus.

10:43.160 --> 10:46.200
 You choose to focus, and you could choose not to focus.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.360
 And that choice is more powerful than any other,

10:49.360 --> 10:52.160
 like, parts of our brain that we've borrowed from fish

10:52.160 --> 10:54.640
 and from our evolutionary origins.

10:54.640 --> 10:58.040
 Like this, whatever this crazy little leap in evolution is

10:58.040 --> 11:00.640
 that allowed us to think is more powerful than anything else.

11:00.640 --> 11:05.560
 So I think neuroscientists pretend they know a lot more

11:05.560 --> 11:07.440
 about the brain than they really do.

11:07.440 --> 11:09.080
 Yeah.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.720
 And that we know. Shots fired.

11:11.720 --> 11:12.560
 I agree with you.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.760
 And we don't know that much yet

11:14.760 --> 11:16.960
 about how the brain functions and what's a fish

11:16.960 --> 11:18.760
 and what, you know, all this stuff.

11:18.760 --> 11:21.400
 So I think what exists there

11:21.400 --> 11:24.880
 is a lot of potentialities.

11:24.880 --> 11:28.720
 But the beauty of the human brain is it's potentialities

11:28.720 --> 11:32.880
 that we have to manifest through our choices.

11:32.880 --> 11:34.440
 It's there. It's sitting there.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.280
 And, yes, there's certain things

11:36.280 --> 11:42.640
 that are going to evoke certain senses, certain feelings.

11:42.640 --> 11:43.760
 I'm not even saying emotions

11:43.760 --> 11:45.320
 because I think emotions are too complex

11:45.320 --> 11:48.120
 to have been programmed into our mind.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.480
 But I don't think so.

11:49.480 --> 11:52.000
 You know, there's this big issue of evolutionary psychology

11:52.000 --> 11:55.760
 is huge right now and it's a big issue.

11:55.760 --> 12:02.760
 You know, I find it to a large extent as way too early

12:02.760 --> 12:08.000
 and in storytelling about expo storytelling about stuff.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.360
 We still don't, you know, so for example,

12:10.360 --> 12:12.240
 I would like to see if evolutionary psychology

12:12.240 --> 12:17.000
 differentiate between things like inclinations,

12:17.000 --> 12:23.600
 feelings, emotions, sensations, thoughts, concepts, ideas.

12:23.600 --> 12:27.080
 What of those are programmed and what of those are developed

12:27.080 --> 12:29.520
 and chosen and a product of reason?

12:29.520 --> 12:33.920
 I think anything from emotion to abstract ideas is all chosen,

12:33.920 --> 12:36.720
 is all a product of reason.

12:36.720 --> 12:42.440
 And everything before that, we might have been programmed for.

12:42.440 --> 12:45.880
 But the fact is so clearly a sensation is not a product of,

12:45.880 --> 12:48.680
 you know, is something that we feel

12:48.680 --> 12:50.720
 because that's how our biology works.

12:50.720 --> 12:54.240
 So until we have these categories

12:54.240 --> 12:58.720
 and until we can clearly specify what is what

12:58.720 --> 13:01.320
 and where do they come from,

13:01.320 --> 13:03.200
 the whole discussion in evolutionary psychology

13:03.200 --> 13:04.320
 seems to be rambling.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.400
 It doesn't seem to be scientific.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.840
 So we have to define our terms, you know,

13:08.840 --> 13:10.000
 which is the basis of science.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.080
 You have to have some clear definitions

13:12.080 --> 13:14.760
 about what we're talking about.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.360
 When you ask them these questions,

13:16.360 --> 13:18.520
 there's never really a coherent answer

13:18.520 --> 13:20.440
 about what is it exactly.

13:20.440 --> 13:22.760
 And everybody is afraid of the issue of free will.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.800
 And I think to some extent, I mean, Harris has this,

13:26.800 --> 13:28.720
 and I don't want to misrepresent anything Harris has

13:28.720 --> 13:33.160
 because, you know, I'm a fan and I like a lot of his stuff.

13:33.160 --> 13:37.200
 But on the one hand, he is obviously intellectually active

13:37.200 --> 13:38.760
 and wants to change our minds.

13:38.760 --> 13:41.920
 So he believes that we have some capacity to choose.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.360
 On the other hand, he's undermining that capacity

13:44.360 --> 13:45.800
 to choose by saying it's just determines

13:45.800 --> 13:47.360
 you're gonna choose what you choose.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.240
 You have no say in it, there's actually no you.

13:51.640 --> 13:55.880
 So it's, you know, and that's to me completely unscientific.

13:55.880 --> 14:00.480
 That's completely him, you know, pulling it out of nowhere.

14:00.480 --> 14:03.640
 We all experienced the fact that we have an eye.

14:03.640 --> 14:06.720
 That kind of certainty saying that we do not have

14:06.720 --> 14:09.320
 that fundamental choice that reason provides

14:09.320 --> 14:12.000
 is unfounded currently.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.840
 Look, there's a sense in which it can never be contradicted

14:15.840 --> 14:20.840
 because it's a product of your experience.

14:20.840 --> 14:21.920
 It's not a product of your experience.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.080
 You can experience it directly.

14:24.080 --> 14:28.240
 So no science will ever prove that this table isn't here.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.160
 I can see it, it's here, right?

14:31.160 --> 14:32.200
 I can feel it.

14:33.360 --> 14:36.400
 I know I have free will because I can introspect it.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.960
 In a sense, I can see it.

14:37.960 --> 14:42.960
 I can see myself engaging it and that is as valid

14:45.640 --> 14:47.520
 as the evidence of my senses.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.720
 Now I can't point at it so that you can see

14:49.720 --> 14:51.400
 the same thing I'm seeing,

14:51.400 --> 14:53.560
 but you can do the same thing in your own consciousness

14:53.560 --> 14:55.200
 and you can identify the same thing.

14:55.200 --> 14:59.160
 And to deny that in the name of science

14:59.160 --> 15:00.560
 is to get things upside down.

15:00.560 --> 15:04.720
 You start with that and that's the beginning of science.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.320
 The beginning of science is the identification

15:07.320 --> 15:10.720
 that I choose and that I can reason

15:10.720 --> 15:13.320
 and now I need to figure out the mechanism,

15:13.320 --> 15:16.720
 the rules of reasoning, the rules of logic.

15:16.720 --> 15:17.680
 How does this work?

15:17.680 --> 15:19.560
 And that's where science comes from.

15:19.560 --> 15:21.200
 Of course, it's possible that science,

15:21.200 --> 15:24.640
 like from my place of AI would be able to,

15:25.680 --> 15:30.680
 if we were able to engineer consciousness or understand,

15:30.960 --> 15:32.120
 I mean, it's very difficult

15:32.120 --> 15:33.440
 because we're so far away from it now,

15:33.440 --> 15:36.760
 but understand how the actual mechanism

15:36.760 --> 15:38.600
 that consciousness emerges.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.600
 And in fact, this table is not real,

15:40.600 --> 15:43.560
 that we can determine that it,

15:45.040 --> 15:47.480
 exactly how our mind constructs the reality

15:47.480 --> 15:51.640
 that we perceive, then you can start to make interesting.

15:51.640 --> 15:54.480
 But our mind doesn't construct the reality that we perceive.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.320
 The reality we perceive is there.

15:56.320 --> 15:59.800
 We perceive a reality that exists.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.160
 Now, we perceive it in particular ways

16:02.160 --> 16:05.040
 given the nature of our senses, right?

16:05.040 --> 16:07.200
 A bat perceives this table differently,

16:07.200 --> 16:08.520
 but it's still the same table

16:08.520 --> 16:12.880
 with the same characteristics and the same identity.

16:12.880 --> 16:16.160
 It's just a matter of, we use eyes,

16:16.160 --> 16:18.040
 they use a radar system to,

16:18.040 --> 16:19.880
 they use sound waves to perceive it,

16:19.880 --> 16:20.840
 but it's still there.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.960
 Existence exists whether we exist or not.

16:22.960 --> 16:27.040
 And so you could create, I mean, I don't know how,

16:27.040 --> 16:28.480
 and I don't know if it's possible,

16:28.480 --> 16:31.000
 but let's say you could create a consciousness, right?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.600
 And I suspect that to do that,

16:33.600 --> 16:37.080
 you would have to use biology, not just electronics,

16:37.080 --> 16:39.320
 but way outside my expertise.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.640
 Because consciousness, as far as we know,

16:42.640 --> 16:43.640
 is a phenomenon of life,

16:43.640 --> 16:45.360
 and you would have to figure out how to create life

16:45.360 --> 16:48.360
 before you created consciousness, I think.

16:48.360 --> 16:51.880
 But if you did that, then that wouldn't change anything.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.680
 All it would say is we have another conscious being.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.720
 Cool, that's great.

16:54.720 --> 16:58.080
 But it wouldn't change the nature of our consciousness.

16:58.080 --> 17:01.360
 Our consciousness is what it is in respect.

17:01.360 --> 17:04.560
 So that's very interesting, I think this is a good way

17:04.560 --> 17:08.240
 to set the table for discussion of objectivism is,

17:09.480 --> 17:12.360
 let me at least challenge a thought experiment,

17:12.360 --> 17:14.200
 which is, I don't know if you're familiar

17:14.200 --> 17:17.280
 with Donald Hoffman's work about reality.

17:17.280 --> 17:20.480
 So his idea is that we're just,

17:20.480 --> 17:23.440
 our perception is just an interface to reality.

17:23.440 --> 17:26.560
 So Donald Hoffman is the guy you see on Vine?

17:26.560 --> 17:27.400
 Yeah.

17:27.400 --> 17:28.840
 Yes, I've met Donald and I've seen his video.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.840
 And look, Donald has not invented anything new.

17:31.840 --> 17:34.040
 This goes back to ancient philosophy.

17:34.040 --> 17:38.200
 Let me just state it in case people aren't familiar.

17:38.200 --> 17:41.480
 I mean, it's a fascinating thought experiment to me,

17:41.480 --> 17:44.120
 like of out of the box thinking, perhaps literally,

17:44.120 --> 17:49.120
 is that there's a gap between the world as we perceive it

17:50.480 --> 17:52.800
 and the world as it actually exists.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.040
 And I think that's, for the philosophy,

17:55.040 --> 17:59.720
 objectivism is a really important gap to close.

17:59.720 --> 18:03.640
 So can you maybe at least try to entertain the idea

18:03.640 --> 18:08.640
 that there is more to reality than our minds can perceive?

18:09.360 --> 18:13.400
 Well, I don't understand what more means, right?

18:13.400 --> 18:14.800
 Of course there's more to reality

18:14.800 --> 18:16.440
 than what our senses perceive.

18:16.440 --> 18:19.320
 That is, for example, I don't know,

18:19.320 --> 18:24.200
 certain elements have radiation, right?

18:24.200 --> 18:25.160
 Uranium has radiation.

18:25.160 --> 18:27.120
 I can't perceive radiation.

18:27.120 --> 18:31.200
 The beauty of human reason is I can,

18:31.200 --> 18:32.440
 through experimentation,

18:32.440 --> 18:34.320
 discover the phenomena of radiation,

18:34.320 --> 18:36.760
 then actually measure radiation.

18:36.760 --> 18:37.640
 And I don't worry about it.

18:37.640 --> 18:39.040
 I can't perceive the world

18:39.040 --> 18:40.400
 the way a bat perceives the world.

18:40.400 --> 18:43.160
 And I might not be able to see certain things,

18:43.160 --> 18:44.960
 but I can, we've created radar,

18:44.960 --> 18:47.800
 so A, we understand how a bat perceives the world,

18:47.800 --> 18:50.280
 and I can mimic it through a radar screen

18:50.280 --> 18:53.280
 and create images like the bat,

18:53.280 --> 18:55.720
 its consciousness somehow perceives it, right?

18:55.720 --> 19:00.240
 So the beauty of human reason is our capacity

19:00.240 --> 19:02.840
 to understand the world beyond

19:02.840 --> 19:05.200
 what our senses give us directly.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.840
 At the end, everything comes in through our senses,

19:07.840 --> 19:10.320
 but we can understand things

19:10.320 --> 19:11.520
 that our senses don't provide us.

19:11.520 --> 19:14.920
 But what he's doing is he's doing something very different.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.400
 He is saying what our senses provides us

19:17.400 --> 19:20.640
 might have nothing to do with the reality out there.

19:20.640 --> 19:25.640
 That is just a random, arbitrary, nonsensical statement.

19:25.680 --> 19:27.240
 And he actually has a whole

19:27.240 --> 19:28.840
 evolutionary explanation for it.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.640
 He runs some simulations.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.400
 The simulations seem, I mean,

19:32.400 --> 19:33.720
 I'm not an expert on this field,

19:33.720 --> 19:35.320
 but they seem silly to me.

19:35.320 --> 19:36.720
 They don't seem to reflect.

19:36.720 --> 19:38.680
 And look, all he's doing is taking

19:38.680 --> 19:41.040
 Immanuel Kant's philosophy,

19:41.040 --> 19:43.200
 which articulate exactly the same cause,

19:43.200 --> 19:48.200
 and he's giving it a veneer of evolutionary ideas.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.360
 I'm not an expert on evolution,

19:50.360 --> 19:52.240
 and I'm not an expert on epistemology,

19:52.240 --> 19:53.560
 which is what this is.

19:53.560 --> 19:57.080
 So to me, as a semi layman,

19:57.080 --> 19:58.760
 it doesn't make any sense.

19:58.760 --> 20:02.480
 And, you know, I'm actually,

20:02.480 --> 20:04.240
 you know, I have this Yaron Book Show.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.480
 I don't know if I'm allowed to pitch it,

20:05.480 --> 20:08.320
 but I've got this Yaron Book Show on YouTube.

20:08.320 --> 20:11.080
 I'm a huge fan of the Yaron Book Show.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.760
 I listen to it very often.

20:12.760 --> 20:17.760
 As a small aside, the cool thing about reason,

20:17.960 --> 20:19.880
 which you practice,

20:19.880 --> 20:21.880
 is you have a systematic way of thinking

20:21.880 --> 20:24.320
 through basically anything.

20:24.320 --> 20:25.360
 Yes.

20:25.360 --> 20:27.520
 And that's so fun to listen to.

20:27.520 --> 20:32.520
 I mean, it's rare that I think there's flaws in your logic,

20:32.640 --> 20:34.480
 but even then it's fun,

20:34.480 --> 20:37.280
 because I'm like disagreeing with the screen.

20:37.280 --> 20:39.040
 And it's great when somebody disagrees with me

20:39.040 --> 20:40.480
 and they give good arguments,

20:40.480 --> 20:42.200
 because that makes it challenging.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.040
 Anyway, sorry.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.200
 You know, so one of the shows I want to do

20:45.200 --> 20:47.720
 in the next few weeks is one of my philosophy,

20:47.720 --> 20:50.240
 bring one of my philosophy friends to discuss the video

20:50.240 --> 20:52.760
 that Hoffman, where he presents his theory,

20:52.760 --> 20:57.760
 because it surprises me how seductive it is.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.240
 And it seems to be so,

21:00.240 --> 21:01.920
 first of all, completely counterintuitive,

21:01.920 --> 21:05.800
 but because, you know, somehow we managed to cross the road

21:05.800 --> 21:06.960
 and not get hit by the car.

21:06.960 --> 21:10.040
 And if our senses did not provide us any information

21:10.040 --> 21:12.160
 about what's actually going on in reality,

21:12.160 --> 21:13.600
 how do we do that?

21:13.600 --> 21:16.000
 And not to mention build computers,

21:16.000 --> 21:17.560
 not to mention fly to the moon

21:17.560 --> 21:18.600
 and actually land on the moon.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.760
 And if reality is not giving us information about the moon,

21:21.760 --> 21:24.560
 if our senses are not giving us information about the moon,

21:24.560 --> 21:25.600
 how did we get there?

21:25.600 --> 21:27.080
 You know, and where did we go?

21:27.080 --> 21:28.840
 Maybe we didn't go anywhere.

21:28.840 --> 21:30.880
 It's just, it's nonsensical to me.

21:30.880 --> 21:35.880
 And it's a very bad place philosophically,

21:37.080 --> 21:38.640
 because it basically says

21:38.640 --> 21:40.760
 there is no objective standard for anything.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.440
 There is no objective reality.

21:42.440 --> 21:43.560
 You can come up with anything.

21:43.560 --> 21:44.640
 You could argue anything.

21:44.640 --> 21:46.000
 And there's no methodology, right?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.120
 My, I believe that at the end of the day,

21:48.120 --> 21:50.000
 what reason allows us to do

21:50.000 --> 21:52.160
 is provides us with a methodology for truth.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.720
 And at the end of the day, for every claim that I make,

21:54.720 --> 21:59.000
 I should be able to boil it down to see,

21:59.000 --> 22:02.560
 yeah, look, the evidence of the census is right then.

22:02.560 --> 22:05.000
 Once you take that away, knowledge is gone

22:05.000 --> 22:06.200
 and truth is gone.

22:06.200 --> 22:09.640
 And that opens it up to, you know, complete disaster.

22:09.640 --> 22:12.720
 So, you know, to me why it's compelling

22:12.720 --> 22:16.160
 to at least entertain this idea,

22:16.160 --> 22:18.920
 first of all, it shakes up the mind a little bit

22:18.920 --> 22:23.920
 to force you to go back to first principles

22:24.080 --> 22:27.360
 and, you know, ask the question, what do I really know?

22:27.360 --> 22:31.440
 And the second part of that that I really enjoy

22:31.440 --> 22:35.400
 is it's a reminder that we know very little

22:35.400 --> 22:37.320
 to be a little bit more humble.

22:37.320 --> 22:40.560
 So if reality doesn't exist at all,

22:40.560 --> 22:43.040
 before you start thinking about it,

22:43.040 --> 22:46.640
 I think it's a really nice wake up call to think,

22:46.640 --> 22:51.160
 wait a minute, I don't really know much about this universe,

22:51.160 --> 22:52.640
 that humbleness.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.960
 I think something I'd like to ask you about

22:54.960 --> 22:57.280
 in terms of reason, when you,

22:58.160 --> 22:59.920
 you can become very confident

23:00.880 --> 23:03.040
 in your ability to understand the world

23:03.040 --> 23:04.840
 if you practice reason often.

23:04.840 --> 23:07.920
 And I feel like it can lead you astray

23:07.920 --> 23:10.440
 because you can start to think,

23:10.440 --> 23:12.960
 it's, so I love psychology

23:12.960 --> 23:15.400
 and psychologists have the certainty

23:15.400 --> 23:17.880
 about understanding the human condition,

23:17.880 --> 23:19.560
 which is undeserved.

23:19.560 --> 23:21.600
 You know, you run a study with 50 people

23:21.600 --> 23:23.720
 and you think you can understand

23:23.720 --> 23:25.640
 the source of all these psychiatric disorders,

23:25.640 --> 23:27.160
 all these kinds of things.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.920
 That's similar kind of trouble

23:28.920 --> 23:31.880
 I feel like you can get into

23:31.880 --> 23:35.320
 when you overreach with reason.

23:35.320 --> 23:36.560
 So I don't think there is such a thing

23:36.560 --> 23:38.240
 as overreaching with reason,

23:38.240 --> 23:40.520
 but there are bad applications of reason.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.120
 There are bad uses of reason

23:42.120 --> 23:44.400
 or the pretense of using reason.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.760
 I think a lot of these psychological studies

23:46.760 --> 23:48.160
 are pretense of using reason.

23:48.160 --> 23:51.080
 And the psychologists have never really taken

23:51.080 --> 23:53.600
 a serious stat class or a serious econometrics class.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.760
 So they use statistics in weird ways

23:55.760 --> 23:57.320
 that just don't make any sense.

23:57.320 --> 23:59.440
 And that's a miss, that's not reason, right?

23:59.440 --> 24:01.120
 That's just bad thinking, right?

24:01.120 --> 24:05.000
 So I don't think you can do too much good thinking.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.360
 And that's what reason is.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.560
 It's good thinking.

24:08.560 --> 24:13.560
 Now, the fact that you try to use reason

24:14.280 --> 24:17.000
 does not guarantee you won't make mistakes.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.840
 It doesn't guarantee you won't be wrong.

24:18.840 --> 24:21.760
 It doesn't guarantee you won't go down a rabbit hole

24:21.760 --> 24:24.320
 and completely get it wrong.

24:24.320 --> 24:29.160
 But it does give you the only existing mechanism to fix it.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.320
 Which is going back to reality,

24:30.320 --> 24:32.600
 going back to facts, going back to reason.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.760
 And getting out of the rabbit hole

24:34.760 --> 24:37.320
 and getting back to reality.

24:37.320 --> 24:40.160
 So I agree with you that it's interesting

24:40.160 --> 24:44.640
 to think about these, what I consider crazy ideas

24:44.640 --> 24:47.760
 because it, oh wait, what is my argument about them?

24:47.760 --> 24:49.840
 If I don't really have a good argument about them,

24:49.840 --> 24:51.040
 then do I know what I know?

24:51.040 --> 24:53.880
 So in that sense, it's always nice to be challenged

24:53.880 --> 24:55.960
 and pushed and oriented.

24:55.960 --> 24:58.320
 You know, the nice thing about objectivism is

24:58.320 --> 25:00.240
 everybody's doing that to me all the time, right?

25:00.240 --> 25:01.760
 Because nobody agrees with me on anything.

25:01.760 --> 25:04.080
 So I'm constantly being challenged,

25:04.080 --> 25:07.440
 whether it's in, by Hoffman on metaphysics

25:07.440 --> 25:08.400
 and epistemology, right?

25:08.400 --> 25:10.480
 On the very foundations of analogy and ethics,

25:10.480 --> 25:13.960
 everybody constantly, and in politics all the time.

25:13.960 --> 25:18.480
 So I find that it's part of, you know,

25:18.480 --> 25:20.200
 I prefer that everybody, there's a sense

25:20.200 --> 25:22.520
 in which I prefer that everybody agreed with me, right?

25:22.520 --> 25:24.400
 Because I think we'd live in a better world.

25:24.400 --> 25:27.600
 But there's a sense in which that disagreement makes it,

25:27.600 --> 25:30.280
 at least up to a point, makes it interesting

25:30.280 --> 25:35.280
 and challenging and forces you to be able to rethink

25:35.640 --> 25:37.320
 or to confirm your own thinking

25:37.320 --> 25:39.520
 and to challenge that thinking.

25:39.520 --> 25:42.240
 Can you try to do the impossible task

25:42.240 --> 25:46.200
 and give a whirlwind introduction to Ayn Rand,

25:46.200 --> 25:49.280
 the many sides of Ayn Rand?

25:49.280 --> 25:53.800
 So Ayn Rand the human being, Ayn Rand the novelist,

25:53.800 --> 25:56.040
 and Ayn Rand the philosopher.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.760
 So who was Ayn Rand?

25:57.760 --> 26:02.760
 Sure, so her life story is one that I think is fascinating

26:04.160 --> 26:07.400
 but it also lends itself to this integration

26:07.400 --> 26:08.840
 of all of these things.

26:08.840 --> 26:12.600
 She was born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1905

26:12.600 --> 26:16.440
 to kind of a middle class family, Jewish family.

26:16.440 --> 26:20.560
 They owned a pharmacy, her father owned a pharmacy.

26:20.560 --> 26:25.000
 And, you know, she grew up, she grew up,

26:25.000 --> 26:28.960
 she was a very, she knew what she wanted to do

26:28.960 --> 26:31.160
 and what she wanted to be from a very young age.

26:31.160 --> 26:32.320
 I think from the age of nine,

26:32.320 --> 26:33.600
 she knew she wanted to be a writer.

26:33.600 --> 26:34.960
 She wanted to write stories.

26:34.960 --> 26:37.320
 That was the thing she wanted to do.

26:37.320 --> 26:41.480
 And, you know, she focused her life after that

26:41.480 --> 26:44.880
 on this goal of I wanna be a novelist, I wanna write.

26:46.120 --> 26:50.000
 And the philosophy was incidental to that in a sense,

26:50.000 --> 26:52.680
 at least until some point in her life.

26:52.680 --> 26:55.680
 She witnessed the Russian Revolution,

26:55.680 --> 26:57.000
 literally it happened outside.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.320
 They lived in St. Petersburg

26:59.320 --> 27:01.360
 where the first kind of demonstrations

27:01.360 --> 27:03.440
 and of the revolution happened.

27:03.440 --> 27:04.520
 So she witnessed it.

27:04.520 --> 27:06.720
 She lived through it as a teenager,

27:07.680 --> 27:10.880
 went to school under the Soviets.

27:10.880 --> 27:15.160
 For a while, they were under kind of on the Black Sea

27:15.160 --> 27:18.040
 where the opposition government was ruling

27:18.040 --> 27:19.760
 and then they would go back and forth

27:19.760 --> 27:21.800
 between the commies and the whites.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.800
 But she experienced what communism was like.

27:23.800 --> 27:26.680
 She saw the pharmacy being taken away from a family.

27:26.680 --> 27:28.880
 She saw their apartment being taken away

27:28.880 --> 27:30.520
 or other families being brought

27:30.520 --> 27:32.640
 into the apartment they already lived in.

27:33.840 --> 27:38.600
 And it was very clear given her nature,

27:38.600 --> 27:42.040
 given her views, even at a very young age

27:42.040 --> 27:44.640
 that she would not survive the system.

27:44.640 --> 27:48.360
 So a lot of effort was put into how did she get out?

27:48.360 --> 27:51.240
 And her family was really helpful in this.

27:51.240 --> 27:54.080
 And she had a cousin in Chicago

27:54.080 --> 27:59.080
 and she had been studying kind of film at the university and...

27:59.440 --> 28:00.440
 This is in her 20s?

28:00.440 --> 28:03.200
 This is in her 20s, early 20s.

28:03.200 --> 28:06.800
 And Lenin, there was a small window

28:06.800 --> 28:09.240
 where Lenin was allowing some people

28:09.240 --> 28:12.440
 to leave under certain circumstances.

28:12.440 --> 28:15.800
 And she managed to get out to go do research on film

28:15.800 --> 28:17.120
 in the United States.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.200
 Everybody knew, everybody who knew her

28:19.200 --> 28:21.120
 knew she would never come back,

28:21.120 --> 28:22.480
 that this was a one way ticket.

28:22.480 --> 28:24.520
 And she got out, she made it to Chicago,

28:24.520 --> 28:28.840
 spent a few weeks in Chicago, and then headed to Hollywood.

28:28.840 --> 28:32.440
 She wanted to write scripts, that was the goal.

28:32.440 --> 28:37.440
 Here's this short woman from Russia with a strong accent,

28:38.160 --> 28:41.680
 learning English, showing up in Hollywood

28:41.680 --> 28:43.600
 and I wanna be a script writer.

28:43.600 --> 28:44.480
 In English.

28:44.480 --> 28:46.520
 In English, writing in English.

28:46.520 --> 28:51.160
 And this is kind of one of these fairytale stories,

28:51.160 --> 28:55.460
 but it's true, she shows up at the Cecil B. DeMille Studios.

28:56.400 --> 28:59.720
 And she has a letter of introduction from her cousin

28:59.720 --> 29:02.040
 in Chicago who owns a movie theater.

29:02.040 --> 29:05.920
 And this is in the late 1920s.

29:05.920 --> 29:08.440
 And she shows up there with this letter and they say,

29:08.440 --> 29:10.400
 don't call us, we'll call you kind of thing.

29:10.400 --> 29:15.400
 And she steps out and there's this massive convertible.

29:15.400 --> 29:18.000
 And in the convertible is Cecil B. DeMille.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.120
 And he's driving slowly past her

29:20.120 --> 29:21.520
 right at the entrance of the studio.

29:21.520 --> 29:23.840
 And she stares at him and he stops the car and he says,

29:23.840 --> 29:25.720
 why are you staring at me?

29:25.720 --> 29:28.200
 And she says, she tells him a story from Russia

29:28.200 --> 29:30.060
 and I wanna make it in the movies,

29:30.060 --> 29:31.560
 I wanna be a script writer one day.

29:31.560 --> 29:35.000
 And he says, well, if you want that, get in the car.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.200
 She gets in the car and he takes her to the back lot

29:38.200 --> 29:40.360
 of his studio where they're filming The King of Kings,

29:40.360 --> 29:41.960
 the story of Jesus.

29:41.960 --> 29:45.160
 And he says, here's a pass for a week.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.280
 If you wanna write for the movies,

29:47.280 --> 29:49.680
 you better know how movies are made.

29:49.680 --> 29:51.680
 And she basically spends a week in there.

29:51.680 --> 29:53.120
 She spends more time there.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.480
 She managed to get an extension.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.080
 She lands up being an extra in the movie.

29:56.080 --> 30:00.800
 So you can see Ayn Rand there is one of the masses

30:00.800 --> 30:03.000
 when Jesus is walking by.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.560
 She meets her future husband on the sets

30:05.560 --> 30:07.320
 of The King of Kings.

30:07.320 --> 30:09.160
 She lands up getting married,

30:09.160 --> 30:12.120
 getting her American citizenship that way.

30:12.120 --> 30:15.840
 And she lands up doing odds and ends jobs in Hollywood,

30:15.840 --> 30:17.640
 living in a tiny little apartment,

30:19.340 --> 30:20.680
 somehow making a living.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.000
 Her husband was an actor.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.560
 He was struggling actors were difficult times.

30:26.560 --> 30:28.760
 And in the evenings, studying English,

30:28.760 --> 30:30.440
 writing, writing, writing, writing,

30:30.440 --> 30:31.840
 and studying and studying and studying.

30:31.840 --> 30:34.640
 And she finally makes it by writing a play

30:34.640 --> 30:39.640
 that is successful in LA and ultimately goes to Broadway.

30:39.640 --> 30:44.640
 And her first novel is a novel called We The Living,

30:44.720 --> 30:47.880
 which is the most autobiographical of all her novels.

30:47.880 --> 30:51.480
 It's about a young woman in the Soviet Union.

30:51.480 --> 30:55.200
 It's a powerful story, a very moving story,

30:55.200 --> 30:58.360
 and probably, if not the best,

30:58.360 --> 31:02.160
 one of the best portrayals of life under communism.

31:02.160 --> 31:02.980
 And how powerful.

31:02.980 --> 31:03.820
 So you would recommend the book?

31:03.820 --> 31:05.160
 Definitely recommend We The Living.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.560
 It's her first novel.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.400
 She wrote it in the spring of 2000.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.360
 First novel she wrote in the 30s.

31:11.360 --> 31:13.240
 And it didn't go anywhere.

31:13.240 --> 31:16.000
 Because if you think about the intelligentsia,

31:16.000 --> 31:20.280
 the people who matter, the people who wrote book reviews,

31:20.280 --> 31:23.400
 this is a time of Durante,

31:23.400 --> 31:25.920
 who's the New York Times guy in Moscow,

31:25.920 --> 31:29.740
 who's praising Stalin to the hills and the success.

31:29.740 --> 31:34.240
 So the novel fails, but she's got a novel out.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.800
 She writes a small novelette called Anthem.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.880
 A lot of people have read that, and it's read

31:38.880 --> 31:39.800
 in high schools.

31:39.800 --> 31:42.160
 It's kind of a dystopian novel,

31:42.160 --> 31:45.800
 and it doesn't get published in the U.S.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.120
 It gets published in the U.K.

31:47.120 --> 31:50.240
 U.K. is very interested in dystopian novels.

31:50.240 --> 31:54.000
 Animal Farm in 1984,

31:54.000 --> 31:57.380
 84 is published a couple of years after, I think,

31:57.380 --> 31:58.880
 after Anthem.

31:58.880 --> 32:01.580
 There's reason to believe he read Anthem.

32:01.580 --> 32:06.580
 And George Orwell read Animal Farm.

32:07.620 --> 32:11.100
 Just a small aside, Animal Farm is probably top.

32:11.100 --> 32:12.960
 I mean, it's weird to say,

32:12.960 --> 32:14.860
 but I would say it's my favorite book.

32:14.860 --> 32:17.580
 Have you seen this movie out now called Mr. Jones?

32:17.580 --> 32:18.420
 No.

32:18.420 --> 32:19.580
 Oh, you've got to see Mr. Jones.

32:19.580 --> 32:21.020
 What's Mr. Jones?

32:21.020 --> 32:22.020
 It's a...

32:22.020 --> 32:22.940
 Sorry for my ignorance.

32:22.940 --> 32:25.620
 No, no, it's a movie, and it hasn't got any publicity,

32:25.620 --> 32:28.180
 which is tragic, because it's a really good movie.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.620
 It's both brilliantly made.

32:29.620 --> 32:31.540
 It's made by a Polish director.

32:31.540 --> 32:32.940
 But it's in English.

32:32.940 --> 32:34.300
 It's a true story,

32:34.300 --> 32:37.540
 and George Orwell's Animal Farm is featured in it

32:37.540 --> 32:40.200
 in the sense that during the story,

32:40.200 --> 32:42.540
 George Orwell is writing Animal Farm,

32:42.540 --> 32:47.300
 and the narrator is reading off sections of Animal Farm

32:47.300 --> 32:49.340
 as the movie is progressing.

32:49.340 --> 32:50.920
 And the movie is a true story

32:50.920 --> 32:55.660
 about the first Western journalist to discover

32:55.660 --> 32:57.700
 and to write about the famine in Ukraine.

32:58.660 --> 33:01.020
 And so he goes to Moscow, and then he gets on a train,

33:01.020 --> 33:02.220
 and he finds himself in Ukraine,

33:02.220 --> 33:05.740
 and it's beautifully and horrifically made.

33:05.740 --> 33:10.460
 So the horror of the famine is brilliantly conveyed.

33:10.460 --> 33:13.020
 And it's a true story, so it's a very moving story,

33:13.020 --> 33:16.540
 very powerful story, and just very well made movie.

33:16.540 --> 33:18.540
 So it's tragic, in my view,

33:18.540 --> 33:20.340
 that not more people are seeing it.

33:20.340 --> 33:23.220
 I was actually recently just complaining

33:23.220 --> 33:25.800
 that there's not enough content

33:25.800 --> 33:29.460
 on the famine in the 30s of stuff.

33:29.460 --> 33:30.580
 There's so much on Hitler.

33:30.580 --> 33:32.500
 I love the reading.

33:32.500 --> 33:35.860
 I'm reading, it's so long, it's been taking me forever,

33:35.860 --> 33:37.740
 The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.

33:37.740 --> 33:39.380
 Yeah, I love it, but.

33:39.380 --> 33:40.980
 Well, I've got the book to compliment that,

33:40.980 --> 33:42.140
 that you have to read.

33:42.140 --> 33:44.180
 It's called The Ominous Parallels.

33:44.180 --> 33:47.060
 It's Lennon Peacock, and it's The Ominous Parallels,

33:47.060 --> 33:52.060
 and it's about the causes of the rise of Hitler,

33:52.740 --> 33:54.220
 but a philosophical causes.

33:54.220 --> 33:58.500
 So whereas The Rise and Fall is more of a kind of,

33:58.500 --> 34:00.880
 the existential kind of what happened,

34:02.900 --> 34:07.700
 but really delving into the intellectual currents

34:07.700 --> 34:11.820
 that led to the rise of Hitler, highly recommend that.

34:11.820 --> 34:15.780
 Basically suggesting how it might rise another.

34:15.780 --> 34:17.220
 That's The Ominous Parallels,

34:17.220 --> 34:20.460
 so the parallel he draws is to the United States,

34:20.460 --> 34:22.660
 and he says those same intellectual forces

34:22.660 --> 34:23.820
 are rising in the United States,

34:23.820 --> 34:28.820
 and this was published, I think, in, published in 82.

34:28.820 --> 34:30.260
 It was published in 82.

34:30.260 --> 34:31.740
 So it was published a long time ago,

34:31.740 --> 34:34.600
 and yet you look around us,

34:34.600 --> 34:37.220
 and it's unbelievably predictive, sadly,

34:37.220 --> 34:38.740
 about the state of the world.

34:38.740 --> 34:40.140
 So I haven't finished Iron Man's story.

34:40.140 --> 34:41.460
 I don't know if you want me to finish it.

34:41.460 --> 34:44.340
 No, no, no, but on that point, I'll have to,

34:44.340 --> 34:46.820
 let's please return to it, but let's now,

34:46.820 --> 34:47.860
 for now, let's talk.

34:47.860 --> 34:49.580
 Let me also say, just because,

34:49.580 --> 34:51.680
 I don't want to forget about Mr. Jones,

34:51.680 --> 34:54.420
 it is true, the point you made,

34:54.420 --> 34:57.580
 there are tons of movies that are anti fascist,

34:57.580 --> 35:00.900
 anti Nazi, and that's good,

35:00.900 --> 35:03.860
 but there are way too few movies that are anti communist,

35:03.860 --> 35:06.900
 just almost not, and it's very interesting,

35:06.900 --> 35:09.300
 and if you remind me later, I'll tell you a story about that.

35:09.300 --> 35:13.900
 But so she publishes Anthem, and then she starts,

35:13.900 --> 35:15.740
 and she's doing okay in Hollywood,

35:15.740 --> 35:18.060
 and she's doing okay with the play,

35:18.060 --> 35:21.620
 and then she starts on the book The Fountainhead,

35:21.620 --> 35:25.220
 and she writes The Fountainhead, and it comes out,

35:25.220 --> 35:28.300
 she finishes it in 1945,

35:28.300 --> 35:33.300
 and she sends it to publishers,

35:33.660 --> 35:37.060
 and publisher after publisher after publisher turn it down,

35:37.060 --> 35:41.860
 and it takes 12 publishers before this editor reads it,

35:41.860 --> 35:44.760
 and says, I want to publish this book,

35:44.760 --> 35:47.060
 and he basically tells his bosses,

35:47.060 --> 35:52.060
 if you don't publish this book, I'm leaving, right?

35:52.340 --> 35:54.700
 And they don't really believe in the book,

35:54.700 --> 35:56.500
 so they publish just a few copies,

35:56.500 --> 35:58.580
 they don't do a mat lot,

35:58.580 --> 36:00.900
 and the book becomes a bestseller from word of mouth,

36:00.900 --> 36:02.900
 and they land up having to publish more and more and more,

36:02.900 --> 36:07.500
 and she's basically gone from this immigrant

36:07.500 --> 36:10.060
 who comes here with very little command of English,

36:10.060 --> 36:14.820
 and to all kinds of odds and ends jobs in Hollywood,

36:14.820 --> 36:19.820
 to writing one of the seminal, I think, American books.

36:21.900 --> 36:24.020
 She is an American author.

36:24.020 --> 36:27.500
 I mean, if you read The Fountainhead, it's not Russian.

36:27.500 --> 36:29.180
 This is not Dostoevsky.

36:29.180 --> 36:32.760
 It feels like a symbol of what America is

36:32.760 --> 36:37.760
 in the 20th century, and I mean, probably, maybe you can,

36:38.260 --> 36:42.460
 so there's a famous kind of sexual rape scene in there.

36:42.460 --> 36:44.780
 Is that like a lesson you wanna throw in

36:44.780 --> 36:46.440
 some controversial stuff

36:46.440 --> 36:49.340
 to make your philosophical books work out?

36:49.340 --> 36:51.980
 I mean, why was it so popular?

36:51.980 --> 36:53.260
 Do you have a sense?

36:53.260 --> 36:54.100
 Or is it just?

36:54.100 --> 36:55.780
 Well, because I think it illustrated,

36:55.780 --> 36:58.940
 first of all, because I think the characters are fantastic.

36:58.940 --> 37:02.840
 It's got a real hero, and I think the whole book

37:02.840 --> 37:05.860
 is basically illustrating this massive conflict

37:05.860 --> 37:09.280
 that I think went on in America then, is going on today,

37:09.280 --> 37:12.500
 and it goes on on a big scale, politics,

37:12.500 --> 37:13.980
 all the way down to the scale

37:13.980 --> 37:16.180
 of the choices you make in your life.

37:16.180 --> 37:20.180
 And the issue is individualism versus collectivism.

37:21.100 --> 37:22.420
 Should you live for yourself?

37:22.420 --> 37:23.660
 Should you live for your values?

37:23.660 --> 37:25.500
 Should you pursue your passions?

37:26.980 --> 37:29.060
 Or should you do what your mother tells you?

37:29.060 --> 37:31.620
 Should you follow your mother's passions?

37:31.620 --> 37:40.620
 And it's very, very much a book about individuals,

37:40.860 --> 37:42.620
 and people relate to that.

37:42.620 --> 37:45.700
 But it obviously has this massive implications

37:45.700 --> 37:47.100
 to the world outside,

37:47.100 --> 37:50.980
 and at the time of collectivism just having been defeated,

37:50.980 --> 37:53.580
 communism, well, fascism,

37:53.580 --> 37:58.620
 and the United States representing individualism

37:58.620 --> 38:01.420
 as defeated collectivism.

38:01.420 --> 38:03.820
 But where collectivist ideas are still popular

38:03.820 --> 38:06.260
 in the form of socialism and communism.

38:06.260 --> 38:09.100
 And for the individual, there's constant struggle

38:09.100 --> 38:10.940
 between what people tell me to do,

38:10.940 --> 38:12.100
 what society tells me to do,

38:12.100 --> 38:13.260
 what my mother tells me to do,

38:13.260 --> 38:15.260
 and what I think I should do.

38:15.260 --> 38:17.580
 I think it's unbelievably appealing,

38:17.580 --> 38:18.860
 particularly to young people

38:18.860 --> 38:21.500
 who's trying to figure out what they wanna do in life,

38:21.500 --> 38:23.740
 trying to figure out what's important in life.

38:24.620 --> 38:27.340
 It had this enormous appeal, it's romantic,

38:27.340 --> 38:29.940
 it's bigger than life, the characters are big heroes.

38:29.940 --> 38:31.660
 It's very American in that sense.

38:31.660 --> 38:32.940
 It's about individualism,

38:32.940 --> 38:35.500
 it's about the triumph of individualism.

38:35.500 --> 38:38.900
 And so I think that's what related,

38:38.900 --> 38:42.980
 and it had this big romantic element from the,

38:42.980 --> 38:44.260
 I mean, when I use romantic,

38:44.260 --> 38:49.260
 I use it kind of in the sense of a movement in art.

38:49.900 --> 38:51.620
 But it also has this romantic element

38:51.620 --> 38:54.180
 in the sense of a relationship between a man and woman

38:54.180 --> 38:55.660
 who's, that's very intriguing.

38:55.660 --> 38:58.180
 It's not only that there's a,

38:58.180 --> 39:00.460
 I would say almost rape scene, right?

39:01.340 --> 39:03.620
 I would say, but it's also that this woman

39:03.620 --> 39:04.980
 is hard to understand.

39:04.980 --> 39:06.900
 I mean, I've read it more than once,

39:06.900 --> 39:09.500
 and I still can't quite figure out Dominique, right?

39:09.500 --> 39:11.620
 Because she loves him and she wants to destroy him

39:11.620 --> 39:13.020
 and she marries other people.

39:13.020 --> 39:14.220
 I mean, think about that too.

39:14.220 --> 39:16.220
 Here she's writing a book in the 1940s.

39:18.580 --> 39:19.860
 There's lots of sex.

39:20.700 --> 39:23.700
 There's a woman who marries more than one person,

39:23.700 --> 39:25.860
 has having sex with more than one person,

39:25.860 --> 39:27.340
 very unconventional.

39:27.340 --> 39:29.860
 She's having married, she's having sex with work

39:29.860 --> 39:31.060
 even though she's not married to work.

39:31.060 --> 39:33.100
 This is 1945.

39:33.100 --> 39:36.940
 And it's very jarring to people.

39:36.940 --> 39:39.820
 It's very unexpected, but it's also a book of its time.

39:39.820 --> 39:42.420
 It's about individuals pursuing their passion,

39:42.420 --> 39:45.540
 pursuing their life and not caring about convention

39:45.540 --> 39:50.100
 and what people think, but doing what they think is right.

39:50.100 --> 39:54.340
 And so I think it's,

39:54.340 --> 39:56.340
 I encourage everybody to read this, obviously.

39:56.340 --> 39:58.300
 So that was, was that the first time

39:58.300 --> 40:03.300
 she articulated something that sounded like a philosophy

40:03.940 --> 40:04.900
 of individualism?

40:04.900 --> 40:08.660
 I mean, the philosophy's there in We The Living, right?

40:08.660 --> 40:12.620
 Because at the end of the day, the woman is,

40:12.620 --> 40:16.060
 the hero of We The Living is this individualist

40:16.060 --> 40:17.300
 stuck in Soviet Union.

40:17.300 --> 40:19.220
 So she's struggling with these things.

40:20.260 --> 40:22.380
 So the theme is there already.

40:22.380 --> 40:23.900
 It's not as fleshed out.

40:23.900 --> 40:26.380
 It's not as articulated philosophically.

40:26.380 --> 40:29.820
 And it's certainly then Anthem, which is a dystopian novel

40:29.820 --> 40:33.660
 where this dystopia in the future has a,

40:33.660 --> 40:36.660
 there's no I, everything is we.

40:37.580 --> 40:40.940
 And it's about one guy who breaks out of that.

40:40.940 --> 40:43.460
 I don't want to give it away, but breaks out of that.

40:43.460 --> 40:48.060
 So these themes are running and then we have,

40:48.060 --> 40:48.980
 and they've been published,

40:48.980 --> 40:53.060
 some of the early Ayn Rand stories that she was writing

40:53.060 --> 40:54.740
 in preparation for writing her novel,

40:54.740 --> 40:57.300
 stories she was writing when she first came to America.

40:57.300 --> 41:01.140
 And you can see these same philosophical elements,

41:01.140 --> 41:04.780
 even in the male, female relationships and the passion

41:04.780 --> 41:07.980
 and the, you know, in the conflict,

41:07.980 --> 41:10.820
 you see them even in those early pieces.

41:10.820 --> 41:12.340
 And she's just developing them.

41:12.340 --> 41:13.900
 It's same philosophically,

41:13.900 --> 41:17.780
 she's developing her philosophy with her literature.

41:17.780 --> 41:20.020
 And of course, after The Fountainhead,

41:20.020 --> 41:22.540
 she starts on what turns out to be her Magnus Opus,

41:22.540 --> 41:24.300
 which is Atlas Shrugged,

41:24.300 --> 41:26.140
 which takes her 12 years to publish.

41:26.140 --> 41:28.700
 By the time, of course, she brings that out,

41:28.700 --> 41:31.020
 every publisher in New York wants to publish it

41:31.020 --> 41:34.220
 because The Fountainhead has been such a huge success.

41:34.220 --> 41:35.380
 They don't quite understand it.

41:35.380 --> 41:37.140
 They don't know what to do with Atlas Shrugged,

41:37.140 --> 41:39.740
 but they're eager to get it out there.

41:39.740 --> 41:41.340
 And indeed it, when it's published,

41:41.340 --> 41:43.540
 it becomes an instant bestseller.

41:43.540 --> 41:44.660
 And the thing about the,

41:44.660 --> 41:46.500
 particularly The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged,

41:46.500 --> 41:49.100
 but true of even Anthem and We the Living,

41:49.100 --> 41:53.220
 she is one of the only dead authors

41:53.220 --> 41:55.340
 that sell more after they've died

41:55.340 --> 41:56.300
 than when they were still alive.

41:56.300 --> 41:58.500
 Now, that's true maybe in music,

41:58.500 --> 42:00.420
 we listen to more Beethoven than when he was alive,

42:00.420 --> 42:02.980
 but it's not true typically of novelists.

42:02.980 --> 42:04.380
 And yet here we are,

42:06.940 --> 42:09.820
 was it 50, 60 years after,

42:09.820 --> 42:13.020
 63 years after the publication of Atlas Shrugged,

42:13.020 --> 42:15.660
 and it sells probably more today than it sold

42:15.660 --> 42:17.580
 when it was a bestseller when it first came out.

42:17.580 --> 42:21.580
 Is it true that it's like one of the most sold books

42:21.580 --> 42:22.420
 in history?

42:22.420 --> 42:23.260
 No.

42:23.260 --> 42:24.100
 Okay.

42:24.100 --> 42:24.940
 I've heard this kind of statement.

42:24.940 --> 42:27.180
 Any Tom Clancy book comes out,

42:27.180 --> 42:28.580
 sells more than Atlas Shrugged.

42:28.580 --> 42:30.780
 But I've read, I've heard statements like this.

42:30.780 --> 42:32.820
 So there was a very,

42:32.820 --> 42:34.620
 and I shouldn't say this, but it's the truth,

42:34.620 --> 42:35.460
 so I'll say it,

42:35.460 --> 42:40.460
 a very unscientific study done by the Smithsonian Institute,

42:40.820 --> 42:42.700
 probably in the early 90s,

42:42.700 --> 42:47.220
 that basically surveyed CEOs and asked them,

42:47.220 --> 42:49.260
 what was the most influential book on you?

42:50.180 --> 42:53.460
 And Atlas Shrugged came out as number two,

42:53.460 --> 42:57.020
 the second most influential book on CEOs in the country.

42:57.020 --> 42:58.700
 But there's so many flaws in the study.

42:58.700 --> 43:01.460
 One was, you want to guess what the number one book?

43:01.460 --> 43:02.300
 Bible.

43:02.300 --> 43:03.140
 The Bible.

43:03.140 --> 43:04.740
 But the Bible was like,

43:05.740 --> 43:07.020
 so maybe they surveyed 100 people.

43:07.020 --> 43:07.860
 I don't know what the exact numbers were,

43:07.860 --> 43:09.860
 but let's say it's 100 people,

43:09.860 --> 43:12.900
 and 60 said the Bible and 10 said Atlas Shrugged,

43:12.900 --> 43:15.020
 and there were a bunch of books over there.

43:15.020 --> 43:16.220
 So, I don't...

43:16.220 --> 43:18.060
 That's, again, the psychology discussion

43:18.060 --> 43:18.900
 what we're having right now.

43:18.900 --> 43:21.580
 Exactly, well, and it's one thing I've learned,

43:21.580 --> 43:23.580
 and maybe COVID has taught me,

43:23.580 --> 43:27.020
 and there are very few people

43:27.020 --> 43:29.540
 who know how to do statistics,

43:29.540 --> 43:33.300
 and almost nobody knows how to think probabilistically,

43:33.300 --> 43:35.500
 that is, think in terms of probabilities,

43:35.500 --> 43:38.180
 that it is a skill, it's a hard skill,

43:38.180 --> 43:39.580
 and everybody thinks they know it.

43:39.580 --> 43:42.300
 So I see doctors thinking they're statisticians

43:42.300 --> 43:45.340
 and giving whole analyses of the data on COVID,

43:45.340 --> 43:46.940
 and they don't have a clue what they're talking about,

43:46.940 --> 43:48.500
 not because they're not good doctors,

43:48.500 --> 43:49.900
 but because they're not good statisticians.

43:49.900 --> 43:50.740
 It's not...

43:52.220 --> 43:53.620
 People think that they have one skill,

43:53.620 --> 43:55.900
 and therefore it translates immediately into another skill,

43:55.900 --> 43:57.220
 and it's just not true.

43:58.780 --> 44:01.780
 So I've been astounded at how bad people are at that.

44:03.580 --> 44:05.740
 For people who haven't read any of the books

44:05.740 --> 44:07.180
 that we were just discussing,

44:09.220 --> 44:11.420
 what would you recommend,

44:11.420 --> 44:14.060
 what book would you recommend they read,

44:14.060 --> 44:17.100
 and maybe also just elaborate

44:17.100 --> 44:20.620
 what mindset should they enter

44:20.620 --> 44:22.780
 the reading of that book with?

44:22.780 --> 44:24.900
 So I would recommend everybody

44:24.900 --> 44:26.900
 read Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged.

44:26.900 --> 44:27.740
 And in one...

44:27.740 --> 44:28.980
 In that order?

44:28.980 --> 44:31.580
 So it would depend on where you are in life, right?

44:31.580 --> 44:35.260
 So it depends on who you are and what you are.

44:35.260 --> 44:38.180
 So Fountainhead is a more personal story.

44:38.180 --> 44:39.660
 For many people, it's their favorite,

44:39.660 --> 44:41.380
 and for many people, it was their first book,

44:41.380 --> 44:43.980
 and they wouldn't replace that, right?

44:46.900 --> 44:49.300
 Atlas Shrugged is a...

44:49.300 --> 44:50.820
 It's about the world.

44:50.820 --> 44:51.660
 Right.

44:51.660 --> 44:54.020
 It's about what impacts the world,

44:54.020 --> 44:55.540
 how the world functions,

44:55.540 --> 44:59.180
 how it's a bigger book in the sense of the scope.

44:59.180 --> 45:01.580
 If you're interested in politics

45:01.580 --> 45:03.620
 and you're interested in the world,

45:03.620 --> 45:05.460
 read Atlas Shrugged first.

45:05.460 --> 45:08.100
 If you're mainly focused on your life, your career,

45:08.100 --> 45:10.380
 what you wanna do with yourself, start with Fountainhead.

45:10.380 --> 45:12.020
 I still think you should read both

45:12.020 --> 45:13.940
 because I think they are...

45:13.940 --> 45:16.620
 I mean, to me, they were life altering,

45:16.620 --> 45:18.820
 and to many, many people, they're life altering,

45:18.820 --> 45:21.820
 and you should go into reading them with an open mind,

45:21.820 --> 45:24.500
 I'd say, and with a...

45:24.500 --> 45:27.020
 Put aside everything you've heard about Ayn Rand.

45:27.020 --> 45:28.740
 Put aside any...

45:28.740 --> 45:30.540
 Even if it's true, just put it aside.

45:30.540 --> 45:33.260
 Even what I just said about Ayn Rand, put it aside.

45:33.260 --> 45:35.500
 Just read the book as a book,

45:35.500 --> 45:39.580
 and let it move you and let your thoughts,

45:39.580 --> 45:41.700
 let it shape how you think,

45:43.500 --> 45:48.500
 and you'll either have a response to it or you won't,

45:48.980 --> 45:52.140
 but I think most people have a very strong response to it,

45:52.140 --> 45:53.820
 and then the question is,

45:55.540 --> 45:57.260
 are they willing to respond to the philosophy?

45:57.260 --> 45:58.700
 Are they willing to integrate the philosophy?

45:58.700 --> 46:01.700
 Are they willing to think through the philosophy or not?

46:01.700 --> 46:02.940
 Because I know a lot of people

46:02.940 --> 46:06.340
 who completely disagree with the philosophy, right?

46:06.340 --> 46:07.620
 Here in Hollywood, right?

46:07.620 --> 46:09.340
 Lots of people here in Hollywood,

46:09.340 --> 46:11.340
 love The Fountainhead.

46:11.340 --> 46:12.180
 Interesting.

46:12.180 --> 46:16.740
 Oliver Stone, who is, I think, a avowed Marxist, right?

46:16.740 --> 46:19.660
 I think he's admitted to being a Marxist, he is.

46:19.660 --> 46:23.180
 His movies certainly reflect a Marxist theme,

46:24.700 --> 46:27.260
 is a huge fan of The Fountainhead,

46:27.260 --> 46:30.380
 and is actually his dream project, he has said in public,

46:30.380 --> 46:33.060
 his dream project is to make The Fountainhead.

46:33.060 --> 46:37.500
 Now, he would completely change it, as movie directors do,

46:37.500 --> 46:40.020
 and he's actually outlined what his script would look like,

46:40.020 --> 46:43.460
 and it would be a disaster for the ideas of The Fountainhead,

46:43.460 --> 46:44.620
 but he loves the story,

46:44.620 --> 46:47.780
 because to him, the story is about artistic integrity.

46:47.780 --> 46:48.980
 Ah, yeah.

46:48.980 --> 46:50.180
 And that's what he catches on.

46:50.180 --> 46:53.060
 And what he hates about the story is the individualism.

46:53.060 --> 46:56.020
 And I think that his movie ends

46:56.020 --> 46:58.620
 with Howard Rourke joining some kind of commune

46:58.620 --> 47:00.660
 of architects that do it for the love

47:00.660 --> 47:02.100
 and don't do it for the money.

47:02.100 --> 47:02.940
 Interesting.

47:02.940 --> 47:04.420
 But so, yeah, so he can connect with you

47:04.420 --> 47:05.260
 without the philosophy,

47:05.260 --> 47:07.460
 and before we get into the philosophy,

47:07.460 --> 47:09.180
 staying on Ayn Rand,

47:10.420 --> 47:12.780
 I'll tell you sort of my own personal experience,

47:12.780 --> 47:15.140
 and I think it's one that people share.

47:15.140 --> 47:18.140
 I've experienced this with two people, Ayn Rand and Nietzsche.

47:19.540 --> 47:24.020
 When I brought up Ayn Rand when I was in my early 20s,

47:24.020 --> 47:28.580
 the number of eye rolls I got from sort of, you know,

47:28.580 --> 47:33.580
 like advisors and so on, that of dismissal,

47:33.580 --> 47:37.260
 I've seen that later in life about more specific concepts

47:37.260 --> 47:38.980
 in artificial intelligence and technical,

47:38.980 --> 47:42.500
 where people decide that this is a set of ideas

47:42.500 --> 47:45.380
 that are acceptable and these sets of ideas are not.

47:45.380 --> 47:48.020
 And they dismissed Ayn Rand

47:49.140 --> 47:52.100
 without giving me any justification

47:52.100 --> 47:54.780
 of why they dismissed her,

47:54.780 --> 47:57.980
 except, oh, that's something you're into

47:57.980 --> 48:00.500
 when you're 19 or 20.

48:00.500 --> 48:02.580
 That's the same thing people say about Nietzsche.

48:02.580 --> 48:05.620
 Well, that's just something you do when you're in college

48:05.620 --> 48:08.740
 and you take an intro to philosophy course.

48:08.740 --> 48:13.740
 So, and I've never really heard anybody cleanly articulate

48:15.460 --> 48:17.620
 their opposition to Ayn Rand,

48:17.620 --> 48:20.420
 in my own private little circles and so on.

48:20.420 --> 48:23.060
 Maybe one question I just wanna ask is,

48:24.340 --> 48:27.820
 why is there such a opposition to Ayn Rand?

48:27.820 --> 48:30.740
 And maybe another way to ask the same thing is,

48:30.740 --> 48:35.100
 what's misunderstood about Ayn Rand?

48:35.100 --> 48:37.380
 So, we haven't talked about the philosophy,

48:37.380 --> 48:38.980
 so it's harder to answer right now.

48:38.980 --> 48:40.140
 We can return to it if you think

48:40.140 --> 48:41.380
 that's the right way to go.

48:41.380 --> 48:43.300
 Well, let me give a broad answer

48:43.300 --> 48:45.100
 and then we'll do the philosophy

48:45.100 --> 48:45.940
 and then we'll return to it,

48:45.940 --> 48:47.460
 because I think it's important to know

48:47.460 --> 48:49.380
 something about her ideas.

48:49.380 --> 48:54.380
 She, I think her philosophy challenges everything.

48:55.540 --> 48:58.180
 It really does, it shakes up the world.

48:58.180 --> 49:01.500
 It challenges so many of our preconceptions.

49:01.500 --> 49:03.500
 It challenges so many of the things

49:03.500 --> 49:06.420
 that people take for granted as truth.

49:07.820 --> 49:10.580
 From religion to morality to politics

49:10.580 --> 49:11.620
 to almost everything,

49:11.620 --> 49:13.740
 there's never quite been a thinker like her

49:13.740 --> 49:17.220
 in the sense of really challenging everything

49:17.220 --> 49:18.540
 and doing it systematically

49:18.540 --> 49:21.380
 and having a complete philosophy

49:21.380 --> 49:23.980
 that is a challenge to everything that has come before her.

49:23.980 --> 49:27.660
 Now, I'm not saying they're on threads that connect,

49:27.660 --> 49:28.500
 they are, right?

49:28.500 --> 49:30.100
 In politics, there might be a thread

49:30.100 --> 49:31.740
 and in morality, there might be a thread,

49:31.740 --> 49:34.820
 but on everything, there's just never been like it.

49:34.820 --> 49:37.940
 And people are afraid of that

49:37.940 --> 49:39.780
 because it challenges them to the core.

49:39.780 --> 49:42.660
 She's basically telling you to rethink almost everything.

49:44.580 --> 49:47.820
 And that is that people reject.

49:47.820 --> 49:49.540
 The other thing that it does,

49:49.540 --> 49:51.580
 and this goes to this point about,

49:51.580 --> 49:54.260
 oh yeah, that's what you do when you're 14, 15, right?

49:54.260 --> 49:55.580
 Yeah.

49:55.580 --> 49:59.540
 She points out to them that they've lost something.

50:00.540 --> 50:02.860
 They've lost their idealism.

50:02.860 --> 50:05.940
 They've lost the youthful idealism.

50:05.940 --> 50:09.980
 What makes youthfulness meaningful

50:09.980 --> 50:13.340
 other than we're in better physical shape,

50:13.340 --> 50:15.380
 starting to feel, because I'm getting older.

50:16.660 --> 50:17.940
 When we're young,

50:19.420 --> 50:21.420
 sometime in the teen years, right?

50:21.420 --> 50:24.540
 There's something that happens to human consciousness.

50:24.540 --> 50:27.260
 We almost awakened and knew, right?

50:27.260 --> 50:30.780
 We suddenly discovered that we can think for ourselves.

50:30.780 --> 50:33.860
 We suddenly discovered that not everything our parents

50:33.860 --> 50:36.140
 and our teachers tell us is true.

50:36.140 --> 50:39.460
 We suddenly discovered that this tool, our minds,

50:39.460 --> 50:42.700
 is suddenly available to us to discover the world

50:42.700 --> 50:44.660
 and to discover truth.

50:44.660 --> 50:46.620
 And it is a time of idealism.

50:46.620 --> 50:49.740
 It's a time of, whoa, I want to, you know,

50:49.740 --> 50:52.260
 the better teenagers, I want to know about the world.

50:52.260 --> 50:53.220
 I want to go out there.

50:53.220 --> 50:54.340
 I don't believe my parents.

50:54.340 --> 50:55.420
 I don't believe my teachers.

50:55.420 --> 50:56.380
 And this is healthy.

50:56.380 --> 50:57.940
 This is fantastic.

50:57.940 --> 50:59.820
 And I want to go out there and experiment.

50:59.820 --> 51:01.460
 And that gets us into trouble, right?

51:01.460 --> 51:03.420
 We do stupid things when we're teenagers.

51:03.420 --> 51:04.260
 Why?

51:04.260 --> 51:05.100
 Because we're experimenting.

51:05.100 --> 51:06.740
 It's the experiential part of it, right?

51:06.740 --> 51:08.980
 We want to go and experience life.

51:08.980 --> 51:09.980
 But we're learning.

51:09.980 --> 51:11.420
 It's part of the learning process.

51:11.420 --> 51:15.420
 And we become risk takers because we want to experience.

51:15.420 --> 51:16.980
 But the risk is something we need to learn

51:16.980 --> 51:19.340
 because we need to learn where the boundaries are.

51:19.340 --> 51:21.780
 And one of the damages that helicopter parents do

51:21.780 --> 51:23.180
 is they prevent us from taking those risks

51:23.180 --> 51:24.380
 so we don't learn about the world

51:24.380 --> 51:26.580
 and we don't learn about where the boundaries are.

51:26.580 --> 51:30.420
 So the teenage years are these years of wonder.

51:30.420 --> 51:32.740
 They're depressing when you're in them

51:32.740 --> 51:33.740
 for a variety of reasons,

51:33.740 --> 51:35.420
 which I think primarily have to do with the culture,

51:35.420 --> 51:38.060
 but also with oneself.

51:38.060 --> 51:41.980
 But they are exciting, the periods of discovery.

51:41.980 --> 51:45.460
 And people get excited about ideas

51:45.460 --> 51:48.660
 and good ideas, bad ideas, all kinds of ideas.

51:48.660 --> 51:50.300
 And then what happens?

51:50.300 --> 51:51.140
 We settle.

51:51.140 --> 51:53.180
 We compromise.

51:53.180 --> 51:55.220
 Whether that happens in college

51:55.220 --> 51:57.580
 where we're taught that nothing exists and nothing matters

51:57.580 --> 52:01.300
 and stop being an idealist, be a cynic, be whatever.

52:01.300 --> 52:03.820
 Or whether it happens when we get married and get a job

52:03.820 --> 52:05.140
 and have kids and are too busy

52:05.140 --> 52:06.940
 and can't think about our ideals and forget

52:06.940 --> 52:09.900
 and just get into the norm of conventional life

52:09.900 --> 52:13.460
 or whether it's because a mother pesters us

52:13.460 --> 52:14.500
 to get married and have kids

52:14.500 --> 52:17.380
 and do all the things that she wanted us to do.

52:17.380 --> 52:19.780
 We give up on those ideals.

52:19.780 --> 52:24.780
 And there's a sense in which Ayn Rand reminds them

52:24.820 --> 52:25.860
 that they gave up.

52:25.860 --> 52:28.860
 That's beautifully, that's so beautifully put and so true.

52:29.980 --> 52:34.260
 It's, it's worth pausing on,

52:34.260 --> 52:38.500
 that this dismissal,

52:38.500 --> 52:41.580
 people forget the beauty of that curiosity.

52:41.580 --> 52:44.260
 That's true in the scientific field too,

52:44.260 --> 52:49.260
 is that youthful joy of like everything is possible

52:51.820 --> 52:56.180
 and we can understand it with the tools of our mind.

52:56.180 --> 52:57.020
 Yes.

52:57.020 --> 52:57.860
 And that's what it's all about.

52:57.860 --> 52:58.900
 That's what Ayn Rand's ideas

52:58.900 --> 53:00.340
 at the end of the day all boil down to,

53:00.340 --> 53:02.500
 is that confidence and that passion

53:02.500 --> 53:05.260
 and that curiosity and that interest.

53:05.260 --> 53:08.820
 And if you think about what academia does

53:08.820 --> 53:10.300
 to so many of us, right?

53:10.300 --> 53:12.740
 We go into academia and we're excited about,

53:12.740 --> 53:14.140
 we're gonna learn stuff.

53:14.140 --> 53:16.220
 We're gonna discover things.

53:16.220 --> 53:18.420
 And then they stick you into sub sub field

53:18.420 --> 53:20.500
 and examining some minutia

53:20.500 --> 53:22.820
 that's insignificant and unimportant.

53:22.820 --> 53:25.580
 And to get published, you have to be conventional.

53:25.580 --> 53:27.060
 You have to do what everybody else does.

53:27.060 --> 53:29.660
 And then there's the tenure process of seven years

53:29.660 --> 53:32.220
 where they put you through this torture to write papers

53:32.220 --> 53:34.180
 that fit into a certain mold.

53:34.180 --> 53:36.700
 And by the time you're done,

53:36.700 --> 53:38.940
 you're in your mid thirties and you've done nothing.

53:38.940 --> 53:39.900
 You discovered nothing.

53:39.900 --> 53:43.020
 You're all in this minutia in this stuff

53:43.020 --> 53:44.340
 and it's destructive.

53:44.340 --> 53:48.100
 And where's holding onto that passion,

53:48.100 --> 53:52.220
 holding onto that knowledge and that confidence is hard.

53:52.220 --> 53:55.500
 And when people do away with it, they become cynical

53:55.500 --> 53:57.340
 and they become part of the system

53:57.340 --> 54:00.300
 and they inflict the same pain on the next guy

54:00.300 --> 54:03.420
 that they suffered because that's part of how it works.

54:03.420 --> 54:06.020
 Yeah, this happens in artificial intelligence.

54:06.020 --> 54:08.940
 This happens when like a young person shows up

54:08.940 --> 54:11.500
 and with like fire in their eyes and they say,

54:11.500 --> 54:14.500
 I want to understand the nature of intelligence.

54:14.500 --> 54:17.020
 And everybody rolls their eyes.

54:18.100 --> 54:20.220
 Well, for these same reasons,

54:20.220 --> 54:21.780
 because they've spent so many years

54:21.780 --> 54:25.060
 on the very specific set of questions

54:25.060 --> 54:30.060
 that kind of they compete over and they write papers over

54:30.060 --> 54:31.660
 and they have conferences about.

54:31.660 --> 54:34.020
 And it's true that incremental research

54:34.020 --> 54:36.100
 is the way you make progress answering the question

54:36.100 --> 54:38.820
 of what is intelligence exceptionally difficult.

54:38.820 --> 54:43.820
 But when you mock it, you actually destroy the realities.

54:45.340 --> 54:47.860
 When we look like centuries from now,

54:47.860 --> 54:49.300
 we'll look back at this time

54:49.300 --> 54:52.620
 for this particular field of artificial intelligence,

54:52.620 --> 54:55.500
 it will be the people who will be remembered,

54:55.500 --> 54:58.020
 will be the people who've asked the question

54:58.020 --> 55:01.500
 and made it their life journey of what is intelligence

55:01.500 --> 55:04.740
 and actually had the chance to succeed.

55:04.740 --> 55:06.660
 Most will fail asking that question,

55:06.660 --> 55:09.500
 but the ones that like had a chance of succeeding

55:09.500 --> 55:11.820
 and had that throughout their whole life.

55:12.700 --> 55:15.060
 And I suppose the same is true for philosophy.

55:15.060 --> 55:16.060
 It's in every field.

55:16.060 --> 55:20.140
 It's asking the big questions and staying curious

55:20.140 --> 55:22.820
 and staying passionate and staying excited

55:22.820 --> 55:26.100
 and accepting failure, right?

55:26.100 --> 55:27.900
 Accepting that you're not going to get it first time.

55:27.900 --> 55:29.580
 You're not going to get the whole thing.

55:29.580 --> 55:31.860
 But, and sometimes you have to do the minutia work

55:31.860 --> 55:34.300
 and I'm not here to say nobody should specialize

55:34.300 --> 55:36.700
 and you shouldn't do the minutia, you have to do that.

55:36.700 --> 55:38.820
 But there has to be a way to do that work

55:38.820 --> 55:41.900
 and keep the passion and keep it all integrated.

55:41.900 --> 55:42.740
 That's another thing.

55:42.740 --> 55:46.420
 I mean, we don't live in a culture that integrates, right?

55:46.420 --> 55:51.060
 We live in a culture that is all about this minutia

55:51.060 --> 55:53.540
 and not, and medicine is another field

55:53.540 --> 55:55.380
 where you specialize in the kidney.

55:55.380 --> 55:57.060
 I mean, the kidney's connected to other things.

55:57.060 --> 55:59.900
 You've got to, and we don't have a holistic view

55:59.900 --> 56:02.220
 of these things and I'm sure in artificial intelligence,

56:02.220 --> 56:04.980
 you're not going to make the big leaps forward

56:04.980 --> 56:07.980
 without a holistic view of what it is

56:07.980 --> 56:08.820
 you're trying to achieve.

56:08.820 --> 56:10.700
 And maybe that's the question of what is intelligence?

56:10.700 --> 56:14.260
 But that's the kind of questions you have to ask

56:14.260 --> 56:17.340
 to make big leaps forward, to really move the field

56:17.340 --> 56:19.300
 in a positive direction.

56:19.300 --> 56:21.940
 And it's the people who can think that way,

56:21.940 --> 56:24.060
 who move fields and move technology,

56:24.060 --> 56:27.340
 who move anything, anything is, everything is like.

56:27.340 --> 56:28.820
 But just like you said, it's painful

56:28.820 --> 56:32.620
 because underlying that kind of questioning is,

56:32.620 --> 56:35.300
 well, maybe the work I've done for the past 20 years

56:35.300 --> 56:40.060
 was a dead end and you have to kind of face that.

56:40.060 --> 56:42.060
 Even just, it might not be true,

56:42.060 --> 56:45.820
 but even just facing that reality is just,

56:45.820 --> 56:47.740
 it's a painful feeling.

56:47.740 --> 56:50.540
 Absolutely, but it's, that's part of the reason

56:50.540 --> 56:52.340
 why it's important to enjoy the work that you do.

56:52.340 --> 56:53.180
 Right.

56:53.180 --> 56:54.780
 So that even if it doesn't completely work out,

56:54.780 --> 56:56.260
 at least you enjoy the process, right?

56:56.260 --> 56:59.260
 It was not a waste because you enjoyed the process.

56:59.260 --> 57:02.700
 And if you learn, as any entrepreneur knows this, right,

57:02.700 --> 57:05.460
 and if you learn from the waste of time,

57:05.460 --> 57:07.500
 from the errors, from the mistakes,

57:07.500 --> 57:10.220
 then you can build on them and make things even better.

57:10.220 --> 57:15.220
 Right, and so the next 20 years are a massive success.

57:16.180 --> 57:18.780
 Can we, another impossible task,

57:18.780 --> 57:22.580
 so you did wonderfully on talking about Ayn Rand,

57:22.580 --> 57:25.900
 the other impossible task of giving a whirlwind overview

57:25.900 --> 57:28.980
 of the philosophy of objectivism,

57:28.980 --> 57:30.580
 the philosophy of Ayn Rand.

57:30.580 --> 57:33.580
 Yeah, so luckily she did it in an essay.

57:33.580 --> 57:35.900
 She talks about doing a philosophy on one foot.

57:37.220 --> 57:39.500
 But let me integrate it with the literature

57:39.500 --> 57:41.740
 and with her life a little bit.

57:41.740 --> 57:45.460
 She wanted to be a writer, but her goal,

57:45.460 --> 57:48.220
 she had a particular goal in her writing.

57:48.220 --> 57:50.140
 She was an idealist, right?

57:50.140 --> 57:52.620
 She wanted to portray the ideal man.

57:52.620 --> 57:55.620
 So one of the things you do when you want to do something

57:55.620 --> 57:56.460
 is what is an ideal man?

57:56.460 --> 57:57.780
 You have to ask that question.

57:57.780 --> 57:58.780
 What does that mean?

57:58.780 --> 58:00.660
 You might have a sense of it.

58:00.660 --> 58:03.940
 You might have some glimpses of it

58:03.940 --> 58:06.380
 in other people's literature, but what is it?

58:07.420 --> 58:09.660
 So she starts reading philosophy to try to figure out

58:09.660 --> 58:11.860
 what do philosophers say about the ideal man?

58:12.740 --> 58:14.540
 And what she finds horrifies her

58:14.540 --> 58:16.660
 in terms of the view of most philosophers of man.

58:16.660 --> 58:20.820
 And she's attracted, certainly when she's young,

58:20.820 --> 58:24.660
 to Nietzsche, because Nietzsche at least has a vision

58:24.660 --> 58:28.460
 of grandeur for man, even though his philosophy

58:28.460 --> 58:30.060
 is very flawed and has other problems

58:30.060 --> 58:32.100
 and contradicts man in many ways.

58:32.100 --> 58:36.060
 But at least he has that vision of what is possible to man.

58:36.060 --> 58:38.100
 And she's attracted to that romantic vision,

58:38.100 --> 58:40.140
 that idealistic vision.

58:40.140 --> 58:41.660
 So she discovers in writing,

58:41.660 --> 58:43.020
 and particularly in writing Atlas Shrugged,

58:43.020 --> 58:44.620
 but even in the Fountainhead,

58:44.620 --> 58:47.340
 that she's gonna have to develop her own philosophy.

58:47.340 --> 58:50.100
 She's gonna have to discover what she can do

58:50.100 --> 58:52.740
 and she's gonna have to discover these ideas for herself,

58:52.740 --> 58:55.820
 because they're not fully articulated anywhere else.

58:55.820 --> 59:00.300
 The glimpses again of it in Aristotle, in Nietzsche,

59:00.300 --> 59:02.020
 but they're not fully fleshed out.

59:02.020 --> 59:05.780
 So to a large extent, she develops a philosophy

59:05.780 --> 59:08.860
 for a very practical purpose, to write,

59:08.860 --> 59:11.260
 to write a novel about the ideal man.

59:11.260 --> 59:14.580
 And Atlas Shrugged is the manifestation of that.

59:14.580 --> 59:18.940
 By the way, sorry to interrupt, as a little aside,

59:18.940 --> 59:22.420
 she does, when you say man, you mean human.

59:22.420 --> 59:26.300
 And because we'll bring this up often,

59:26.300 --> 59:28.820
 she does, maybe you can elaborate

59:28.820 --> 59:33.340
 of how she specifically uses man and he in the work.

59:33.340 --> 59:36.220
 We live in a time now of gender and so on.

59:36.220 --> 59:40.300
 Well, she did that in the sense that everybody did it

59:40.300 --> 59:41.500
 during her period of time, right?

59:41.500 --> 59:45.340
 It's only in modern times where we do he slash she, right?

59:45.340 --> 59:48.580
 Historically, when you said he, you meant a human being,

59:48.580 --> 59:51.580
 unless the particular context implied that it was a...

59:51.580 --> 59:55.700
 But in Ayn Rand's case, in this case, in this one sentence,

59:55.700 --> 59:57.340
 she probably meant man.

59:58.780 --> 1:00:02.020
 Not that, because she viewed that there are differences

1:00:02.020 --> 1:00:03.820
 between men and women, we're not the same,

1:00:03.820 --> 1:00:06.020
 which I know comes at a shock to many people.

1:00:06.020 --> 1:00:11.020
 But she...

1:00:11.060 --> 1:00:12.340
 She's working on a character.

1:00:12.340 --> 1:00:15.420
 She was working on a particular vision, right?

1:00:15.420 --> 1:00:18.860
 She considered herself a man worshiper.

1:00:18.860 --> 1:00:23.020
 And a man, not human being, a male.

1:00:23.020 --> 1:00:28.020
 She worshiped manhood, if you will, the hero in man.

1:00:28.540 --> 1:00:31.980
 And she wanted to fully understand what that was.

1:00:31.980 --> 1:00:35.260
 Now, it has massive implications for ideal woman.

1:00:35.260 --> 1:00:36.900
 And I think she does portray the ideal woman

1:00:36.900 --> 1:00:40.780
 in Atlas Shrugged, in the character of Dagny.

1:00:40.780 --> 1:00:45.780
 But her goal is, I think her selfish goal

1:00:46.420 --> 1:00:49.140
 for what she wanted to get out of the novel

1:00:49.140 --> 1:00:52.580
 is that excitement, partially sexual,

1:00:52.580 --> 1:00:56.220
 about seeing your ideal manifest in reality

1:00:56.220 --> 1:01:01.220
 of what you perceive as that which you would be attracted to

1:01:02.300 --> 1:01:05.260
 fully, intellectually, physically, sexually,

1:01:05.260 --> 1:01:06.580
 in every aspect of your life.

1:01:06.580 --> 1:01:08.060
 That's what she's trying to bring into it.

1:01:08.060 --> 1:01:11.340
 So there was no ambiguity of gender, so there was a masculinity

1:01:11.340 --> 1:01:12.780
 and a femininity in her work.

1:01:12.780 --> 1:01:14.300
 Very much so.

1:01:14.300 --> 1:01:16.500
 And if you read the novels, you see that.

1:01:16.500 --> 1:01:17.340
 You see that.

1:01:17.340 --> 1:01:21.420
 Now, remember, this is in the context of, in Atlas Shrugged,

1:01:21.420 --> 1:01:25.500
 she is portraying a woman who runs a railroad,

1:01:25.500 --> 1:01:28.420
 the most masculine of all jobs you can imagine, right?

1:01:28.420 --> 1:01:31.700
 Running a railroad, better than any man can run it.

1:01:31.700 --> 1:01:33.380
 And achieving huge success,

1:01:33.380 --> 1:01:35.780
 better than any other man out there.

1:01:35.780 --> 1:01:40.780
 But, but for her, even Dagny needs somebody to,

1:01:42.420 --> 1:01:47.300
 needs a man, in some sense, to look up to.

1:01:47.300 --> 1:01:48.220
 Yeah.

1:01:48.220 --> 1:01:51.340
 And that's the character whose name I won't mention

1:01:51.340 --> 1:01:53.180
 because it gives away too much of the plot.

1:01:53.180 --> 1:01:54.780
 But there has to be that.

1:01:54.780 --> 1:01:55.820
 I like how you do that.

1:01:55.820 --> 1:01:57.060
 You're good.

1:01:57.060 --> 1:01:59.620
 You're not, a lot of practice, a lot of practice.

1:01:59.620 --> 1:02:01.020
 Nothing, brilliant.

1:02:01.020 --> 1:02:02.700
 Because you convey all the important things

1:02:02.700 --> 1:02:04.500
 without giving away plot lines.

1:02:04.500 --> 1:02:05.340
 That's beautiful.

1:02:05.340 --> 1:02:06.180
 You're a master.

1:02:06.180 --> 1:02:09.300
 So she's, so she's very much,

1:02:09.300 --> 1:02:14.300
 she, she described herself once as a male chauvinist.

1:02:15.340 --> 1:02:16.180
 Okay.

1:02:16.180 --> 1:02:20.940
 She very, she likes the idea of a man opening a door for her.

1:02:20.940 --> 1:02:25.940
 But more metaphysically, she identifies something

1:02:25.940 --> 1:02:28.980
 in the difference between the way a man relates to a woman

1:02:28.980 --> 1:02:30.180
 and a woman relates to a man.

1:02:30.180 --> 1:02:32.100
 It's not the same.

1:02:32.100 --> 1:02:35.300
 And let's not take too far of a tangent,

1:02:35.300 --> 1:02:40.300
 but I just, as a side comment, I, to me, she represented,

1:02:41.260 --> 1:02:43.140
 she was a feminist to me.

1:02:43.140 --> 1:02:45.740
 Perhaps there's a, perhaps technically,

1:02:45.740 --> 1:02:47.540
 philosophy, you disagree with that, whatever.

1:02:47.540 --> 1:02:52.540
 But the, you know, that to me represented strong,

1:02:52.620 --> 1:02:55.380
 like she had some of the strongest female characters

1:02:55.380 --> 1:02:56.780
 in the history of literature.

1:02:56.780 --> 1:03:00.180
 Again, this is, this is a woman running a railroad in 1957.

1:03:00.180 --> 1:03:01.020
 Yeah.

1:03:01.020 --> 1:03:02.620
 And not just a woman running a railroad,

1:03:02.620 --> 1:03:05.020
 and this is true of the Fountainhead as well.

1:03:05.020 --> 1:03:09.740
 A woman who is sexually, in a sense, assertive,

1:03:09.740 --> 1:03:11.220
 sexually open.

1:03:13.540 --> 1:03:15.700
 This is, this is not a woman who, you know,

1:03:15.700 --> 1:03:20.380
 this is a woman who, who, who embraces her sexuality.

1:03:20.380 --> 1:03:22.740
 And, you know, sex is important in life.

1:03:22.740 --> 1:03:24.540
 This is why it keeps coming up, right?

1:03:24.540 --> 1:03:25.900
 It's, it was important to Ayn Rand.

1:03:25.900 --> 1:03:27.380
 It was, it's important in the novels.

1:03:27.380 --> 1:03:28.940
 It's important in life.

1:03:28.940 --> 1:03:32.340
 And for her, one's attitude towards sex

1:03:32.340 --> 1:03:34.460
 is a reflection of one's attitude towards life.

1:03:34.460 --> 1:03:36.700
 And it, you know, and what attitude towards pleasure,

1:03:36.700 --> 1:03:38.380
 which is an important part of life.

1:03:38.380 --> 1:03:41.900
 And she thought that was an incredibly important thing.

1:03:41.900 --> 1:03:46.900
 And so she has these assertive, powerful, sexual women

1:03:48.900 --> 1:03:53.900
 who live their lives on their terms 100%,

1:03:54.100 --> 1:03:56.940
 who seek a man to look up to.

1:03:56.940 --> 1:03:57.780
 Yeah.

1:03:57.780 --> 1:04:00.660
 It's not, it is psychologically complex.

1:04:00.660 --> 1:04:02.300
 It's more psychology than philosophy, right?

1:04:02.300 --> 1:04:05.100
 It's psychologically complex and, you know,

1:04:05.100 --> 1:04:07.700
 not my area of expertise, but this is,

1:04:07.700 --> 1:04:10.420
 there's something in, she would argue,

1:04:10.420 --> 1:04:12.780
 there's something fundamentally different

1:04:12.780 --> 1:04:16.140
 about a male and a woman, about a male and female,

1:04:16.140 --> 1:04:18.820
 psychologically in their attitude towards one another.

1:04:18.820 --> 1:04:21.980
 Yeah, but as a side note, I say that,

1:04:21.980 --> 1:04:25.500
 I would say that, I don't know philosophically

1:04:25.500 --> 1:04:28.940
 if her ideas about gender are interesting.

1:04:28.940 --> 1:04:30.740
 I think her other philosophical ideas

1:04:30.740 --> 1:04:32.300
 are much more interesting.

1:04:32.300 --> 1:04:36.180
 But reading wise, like the stories it created,

1:04:36.180 --> 1:04:39.460
 the tension it created, that was pretty powerful.

1:04:39.460 --> 1:04:43.300
 I mean, that was, that's pretty powerful stuff.

1:04:43.300 --> 1:04:45.660
 I'll speculate that the reason it's so powerful

1:04:45.660 --> 1:04:47.380
 is because it reflects something in reality.

1:04:47.380 --> 1:04:48.660
 Yeah, that's true.

1:04:48.660 --> 1:04:50.140
 There's a thread that at least.

1:04:50.140 --> 1:04:53.380
 And look, it's really important to say,

1:04:53.380 --> 1:04:56.340
 I think she was the first feminist in a sense.

1:04:56.340 --> 1:04:57.900
 I think in a sense, the feminists have

1:04:57.900 --> 1:05:00.780
 promoted feminism into something that it shouldn't be.

1:05:00.780 --> 1:05:04.180
 But in the sense of men and women are capable,

1:05:05.980 --> 1:05:08.580
 she was the first one who really put that

1:05:08.580 --> 1:05:10.660
 into a novel and showed it.

1:05:10.660 --> 1:05:15.540
 To me, as a boy, when I was reading Alice Shrugged,

1:05:15.540 --> 1:05:18.180
 I think I read that before Fountainhead,

1:05:18.180 --> 1:05:20.460
 that was one of the early introductions,

1:05:20.460 --> 1:05:21.820
 at least of an American woman,

1:05:21.820 --> 1:05:24.180
 I had examples of my own life of Russian women,

1:05:24.180 --> 1:05:26.900
 but of like a badass lady.

1:05:26.900 --> 1:05:30.180
 Like I admire, like I love engineering.

1:05:30.180 --> 1:05:32.380
 I had loved that she could, you know,

1:05:32.380 --> 1:05:34.340
 here's a lady that's running the show.

1:05:34.340 --> 1:05:36.660
 So that at least to me was an example

1:05:36.660 --> 1:05:38.980
 of a really strong woman, but objectivism.

1:05:38.980 --> 1:05:39.820
 Objectivism.

1:05:39.820 --> 1:05:42.020
 So, and so she developed it for a novel.

1:05:42.020 --> 1:05:43.980
 She spent the latter part of her life

1:05:43.980 --> 1:05:45.380
 after the publication of Alice Shrugged

1:05:45.380 --> 1:05:46.820
 really articulating her philosophy.

1:05:46.820 --> 1:05:47.740
 So that's what she did.

1:05:47.740 --> 1:05:50.780
 She applied it to politics, to life, to gender,

1:05:50.780 --> 1:05:54.260
 to all these issues from 1957 until she died in 1982.

1:05:54.260 --> 1:05:56.100
 So the objectivism was born

1:05:56.100 --> 1:05:57.900
 out of the later parts of Alice Shrugged.

1:05:57.900 --> 1:05:59.300
 Yes, definitely.

1:05:59.300 --> 1:06:00.460
 It was there all the time,

1:06:00.460 --> 1:06:02.940
 but it was fleshed out during the latter parts

1:06:02.940 --> 1:06:04.340
 of Alice Shrugged and then articulated

1:06:04.340 --> 1:06:05.180
 for the next 20 years.

1:06:05.180 --> 1:06:06.660
 So what is objectivism?

1:06:06.660 --> 1:06:09.900
 So objectivism, so there are five branches in philosophy.

1:06:09.900 --> 1:06:13.180
 And so I'm gonna just go through the branches.

1:06:13.180 --> 1:06:15.060
 She starts with, you start with metaphysics,

1:06:15.060 --> 1:06:16.780
 the nature of reality.

1:06:16.780 --> 1:06:20.220
 And objectivism argues that reality is what it is.

1:06:20.220 --> 1:06:22.820
 It's kind of goes Hawkins back to Aristotle,

1:06:22.820 --> 1:06:24.900
 law of identity, A is A.

1:06:24.900 --> 1:06:27.020
 You can wish it to be B,

1:06:27.020 --> 1:06:29.460
 but wishes do not make something real.

1:06:29.460 --> 1:06:32.620
 Reality is what it is and it is the primary.

1:06:32.620 --> 1:06:37.420
 And it's not manipulated, directed by consciousness.

1:06:37.420 --> 1:06:40.420
 Consciousness is there to observe,

1:06:42.980 --> 1:06:45.900
 to give us information about reality.

1:06:45.900 --> 1:06:48.220
 That is the purpose of consciousness.

1:06:48.220 --> 1:06:50.340
 That is the nature of it.

1:06:50.340 --> 1:06:54.580
 So in metaphysics, existence exists.

1:06:54.580 --> 1:06:57.180
 The law of identity, the law of causality,

1:06:57.180 --> 1:07:01.100
 things act based on their nature,

1:07:01.100 --> 1:07:05.420
 not randomly, not arbitrarily, but based on their nature.

1:07:05.420 --> 1:07:08.420
 And then we have the tool to know reality.

1:07:08.420 --> 1:07:11.420
 This is epistemology, the theory of knowledge.

1:07:11.420 --> 1:07:14.340
 A tool to know reality is reason.

1:07:14.340 --> 1:07:16.620
 It's our senses and our capacity

1:07:16.620 --> 1:07:19.140
 to integrate the information we get from our senses

1:07:19.140 --> 1:07:20.700
 and to integrate it into new knowledge

1:07:20.700 --> 1:07:22.580
 and to conceptualize it.

1:07:22.580 --> 1:07:25.220
 And that is uniquely human.

1:07:26.420 --> 1:07:31.220
 We don't know the truth from revelation.

1:07:32.100 --> 1:07:35.220
 We don't know truth from our emotions.

1:07:35.220 --> 1:07:36.900
 Our emotions are interesting.

1:07:36.900 --> 1:07:39.540
 Our emotions tell us something about ourselves,

1:07:39.540 --> 1:07:42.380
 but our emotions are not tools of cognition.

1:07:42.380 --> 1:07:45.180
 They don't tell us the truth about what's out there,

1:07:45.180 --> 1:07:47.660
 about what's in reality.

1:07:47.660 --> 1:07:50.860
 So reason is our means of knowledge

1:07:50.860 --> 1:07:53.340
 and therefore reason is our means of survival.

1:07:54.340 --> 1:07:56.180
 Only individuals reason,

1:07:56.180 --> 1:07:59.140
 just in the same way that only individuals can eat.

1:07:59.140 --> 1:08:00.900
 We don't have a collective stomach.

1:08:00.900 --> 1:08:05.700
 Nobody can eat for me and therefore nobody can think for me.

1:08:05.700 --> 1:08:07.260
 We don't have a collective mind.

1:08:07.260 --> 1:08:09.420
 There's no collective consciousness.

1:08:09.420 --> 1:08:11.780
 It's bizarre that people talk about

1:08:11.780 --> 1:08:14.980
 these collectivized aspects of the mind.

1:08:14.980 --> 1:08:16.700
 They don't talk about collective feet

1:08:16.700 --> 1:08:18.780
 and collective stomachs and collective things.

1:08:18.780 --> 1:08:21.780
 But so we all think for ourselves

1:08:21.780 --> 1:08:25.340
 and it is our fundamental basic responsibility

1:08:25.340 --> 1:08:29.900
 to live our lives, to live, to choose.

1:08:29.900 --> 1:08:32.740
 Once we choose to live, to live our lives

1:08:32.740 --> 1:08:34.140
 to the best of our ability.

1:08:35.140 --> 1:08:38.060
 So in morality, she is an egoist.

1:08:38.060 --> 1:08:40.420
 She believes that the purpose of morality

1:08:40.420 --> 1:08:43.540
 is to provide you with a code of values and virtues

1:08:43.540 --> 1:08:47.780
 to guide your life for the purpose of your own success,

1:08:47.780 --> 1:08:51.100
 your own survival, your own thriving, your own happiness.

1:08:51.100 --> 1:08:54.300
 Happiness is the moral purpose of your life.

1:08:54.300 --> 1:08:57.700
 The purpose of morality is to guide you towards a happy life.

1:08:57.700 --> 1:08:58.740
 Your own happiness.

1:08:58.740 --> 1:09:00.540
 Your own happiness, absolutely.

1:09:00.540 --> 1:09:01.820
 Your own happiness.

1:09:01.820 --> 1:09:03.140
 So she rejects the idea

1:09:03.140 --> 1:09:04.860
 that you should live other people.

1:09:04.860 --> 1:09:06.140
 That you should live for the purpose

1:09:06.140 --> 1:09:07.740
 of other people's happiness.

1:09:07.740 --> 1:09:09.340
 Your purpose is not to make them happier,

1:09:09.340 --> 1:09:10.220
 to make them anything.

1:09:10.220 --> 1:09:12.020
 Your purpose is your own happiness.

1:09:12.020 --> 1:09:14.520
 But she also rejects the idea

1:09:14.520 --> 1:09:18.040
 that you could argue maybe the Nietzschean idea

1:09:18.040 --> 1:09:22.080
 of you should use other people for your own purposes, right?

1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:24.440
 So every person is an end in himself.

1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:28.160
 Every person's moral responsibility is their own happiness.

1:09:28.160 --> 1:09:30.120
 And you shouldn't use other people for your own,

1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:32.040
 shouldn't exploit other people for your own happiness,

1:09:32.040 --> 1:09:33.300
 and you shouldn't allow yourself

1:09:33.300 --> 1:09:34.960
 to be exploited for other people.

1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:37.260
 Every individual is responsible for themselves.

1:09:38.740 --> 1:09:40.800
 And what is it that allows us to be happy?

1:09:40.800 --> 1:09:44.680
 What is it that facilitates human flourishing,

1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:46.960
 human success, human survival?

1:09:46.960 --> 1:09:49.000
 Well, it's the use of our minds, right?

1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:50.340
 It goes back to reason.

1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:56.140
 And what does reason require in order to be successful,

1:09:56.140 --> 1:09:58.600
 in order to work effectively?

1:10:00.120 --> 1:10:02.200
 It requires freedom.

1:10:02.200 --> 1:10:07.000
 So the enemy of reason, the enemy of reason is force.

1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.120
 The enemy of reason is coercion.

1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:12.840
 The enemy of reason is authority, right?

1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:16.800
 The Catholic church doing what they did to Galileo, right?

1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:19.160
 That restricts Galileo's thinking, right?

1:10:19.160 --> 1:10:20.400
 When he's in house arrest,

1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:21.640
 is he gonna come up with a new theory?

1:10:21.640 --> 1:10:23.720
 Is he gonna discover new truths?

1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:28.720
 No, the punishment is too, you know, it's too dangerous.

1:10:29.140 --> 1:10:34.140
 So force, coercion are enemies of reason.

1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:39.060
 And what reason needs is to be free,

1:10:39.060 --> 1:10:42.680
 to think, to discover, to innovate,

1:10:42.680 --> 1:10:44.660
 to break out of convention.

1:10:46.320 --> 1:10:48.680
 So we need to create an environment

1:10:48.680 --> 1:10:52.400
 in which individuals are free to reason, free to think.

1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:55.640
 And to do that, we come up with a concept,

1:10:55.640 --> 1:10:57.200
 historically we've come up with a concept

1:10:57.200 --> 1:10:58.760
 of individual rights.

1:10:58.760 --> 1:11:01.520
 Individual rights define the scope of,

1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:05.540
 define the fact that we should be left alone,

1:11:05.540 --> 1:11:09.400
 free to pursue our values, using our reason,

1:11:09.400 --> 1:11:10.240
 free of what?

1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:12.400
 Free of coercion, force, authority.

1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:14.840
 And that the job of government

1:11:14.840 --> 1:11:17.180
 is to make sure that we are free.

1:11:17.180 --> 1:11:18.400
 The whole point of government,

1:11:18.400 --> 1:11:21.680
 the whole point of when we come in a social context,

1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:25.540
 the whole point of establish a government in that context

1:11:25.540 --> 1:11:30.040
 is to secure that freedom.

1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:34.640
 It's to make sure that I don't use coercion on you.

1:11:34.640 --> 1:11:36.040
 The government is supposed to stop me,

1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:38.080
 supposed to intervene before I can do that,

1:11:38.080 --> 1:11:40.440
 or if I've already done it,

1:11:40.440 --> 1:11:42.680
 to prevent me from doing it again.

1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:47.040
 So the purpose of government is to protect our freedom

1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:49.940
 to think and to act based on our thoughts.

1:11:49.940 --> 1:11:53.380
 It's to leave individuals free to pursue their values,

1:11:53.380 --> 1:11:58.380
 to pursue their happiness, to pursue their rational thought,

1:11:59.100 --> 1:12:01.560
 and to be left alone to do it.

1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:06.480
 And so she rejects socialism, which basically assumes

1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:07.800
 some kind of collective goal,

1:12:07.800 --> 1:12:11.000
 assumes the sacrifice of the individual to the group,

1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.080
 assumes that your moral purpose in life

1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:15.800
 is the well being of other people rather than your own.

1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:20.560
 And she rejects all form of statism,

1:12:20.560 --> 1:12:25.000
 all form of government that is overly,

1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:28.680
 that is involved in any aspect

1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:32.580
 other than to protect us from forced coercion authority.

1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:36.600
 And she rejects anarchy, and we can talk about that.

1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:39.480
 I think you had a question in the list of questions

1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:41.040
 you sent me about anarchy.

1:12:41.040 --> 1:12:41.880
 And I'm happy to discuss that.

1:12:41.880 --> 1:12:43.480
 I just talked to Michael Malice about anarchy,

1:12:43.480 --> 1:12:45.720
 so I don't know if you're familiar with him.

1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:46.760
 Yes, I'm familiar with him.

1:12:46.760 --> 1:12:49.840
 So yeah, so she would completely reject anarchy.

1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:52.440
 Anarchy is completely inconsistent with her point of view,

1:12:52.440 --> 1:12:54.120
 and we can talk about why if you want.

1:12:54.120 --> 1:12:57.200
 So there is some perfect place where freedom is maximized,

1:12:57.200 --> 1:12:58.920
 so systems of government and that.

1:12:58.920 --> 1:12:59.760
 Absolutely.

1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:01.560
 And she thought that the American system of government

1:13:01.560 --> 1:13:04.080
 came close in its idea,

1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:08.460
 obviously founded with original sin, with the sin of slavery,

1:13:08.460 --> 1:13:11.320
 but in its conception, the Declaration of Independence

1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:14.620
 is about as perfect a political document as one could write.

1:13:14.620 --> 1:13:17.080
 I think the greatest political document in human history,

1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:21.920
 but really articulated almost perfectly and beautifully.

1:13:21.920 --> 1:13:23.160
 And that the American system of government

1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:25.120
 with the checks as balances,

1:13:25.120 --> 1:13:27.540
 which is with its emphasis on individual rights,

1:13:27.540 --> 1:13:29.440
 with its emphasis on freedom,

1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:32.200
 with its emphasis on leaving individual freedom

1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:33.360
 to pursue their happiness,

1:13:33.360 --> 1:13:36.600
 an explicit recognition of happiness as a goal,

1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:39.200
 individual happiness, was the model.

1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:40.480
 It wasn't perfect.

1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:42.280
 There are a lot of problems to a large extent

1:13:42.280 --> 1:13:45.400
 because the founders had mixed philosophical premises.

1:13:45.400 --> 1:13:50.400
 So there were alien premises introduced

1:13:50.500 --> 1:13:52.220
 into the founding of the country,

1:13:52.220 --> 1:13:55.040
 slavery obviously being the biggest problem.

1:13:55.040 --> 1:13:56.840
 But it was close.

1:13:56.840 --> 1:13:59.000
 And we need to build on that

1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.240
 to create an ideal political system

1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:06.200
 that will, yes, maximize the freedom of individuals

1:14:06.200 --> 1:14:07.340
 to do exactly this.

1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:10.640
 And then of course she had,

1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:12.320
 so that's kind of,

1:14:12.320 --> 1:14:15.400
 that's the manifestation of this individualism

1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:16.720
 in a political realm.

1:14:16.720 --> 1:14:18.000
 And she had a theory of art.

1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:19.520
 She had a theory of aesthetics,

1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:21.560
 which is the fifth branch of,

1:14:21.560 --> 1:14:25.040
 she have metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and politics.

1:14:25.040 --> 1:14:26.840
 And the fifth branch is aesthetics.

1:14:26.840 --> 1:14:31.680
 And she viewed art as an essential human need,

1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:34.120
 a fuel for the human spirit.

1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:36.200
 And that just like any human need,

1:14:36.200 --> 1:14:40.160
 it had certain principles that it had to abide by.

1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:42.720
 That is just like there's nutrition, right?

1:14:42.720 --> 1:14:43.960
 So some food is good for you

1:14:43.960 --> 1:14:45.120
 and some food is bad for you.

1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:47.720
 Some food, some stuff is poison.

1:14:47.720 --> 1:14:49.600
 She believed the same is true of art,

1:14:49.600 --> 1:14:51.600
 that art had an identity,

1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:53.840
 which is very controversial today, right?

1:14:53.840 --> 1:14:57.240
 If you put a frame around it, it is art, right?

1:14:57.240 --> 1:15:01.080
 If you put a urinal in a museum, it becomes art,

1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:05.040
 which she thought was evil and ludicrous,

1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:07.120
 and she rejected completely.

1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:09.080
 That art had an identity

1:15:09.080 --> 1:15:11.400
 and that it served a certain function

1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:13.560
 that human beings needed it.

1:15:13.560 --> 1:15:15.160
 And if it didn't have,

1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:17.160
 not only did it have the identity,

1:15:17.160 --> 1:15:20.040
 but that function was served well by some art

1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:21.400
 and poorly by other art.

1:15:22.600 --> 1:15:24.840
 And then there's a whole realm of stuff that's not art.

1:15:24.840 --> 1:15:28.680
 Basically, all of what today is considered modern art,

1:15:28.680 --> 1:15:31.280
 she would consider as not being art.

1:15:31.280 --> 1:15:34.040
 Splashing paint on a canvas, not art.

1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:40.080
 So she had very clear ideas.

1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:42.480
 She articulated them not,

1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:46.280
 so I would say not in conventional philosophical form.

1:15:46.280 --> 1:15:49.160
 So she didn't write philosophical essays

1:15:49.160 --> 1:15:51.800
 using the philosopher's language.

1:15:51.800 --> 1:15:54.400
 It's why, partially why I think philosophers

1:15:54.400 --> 1:15:56.080
 have never taken it seriously.

1:15:56.080 --> 1:15:58.280
 They're actually accessible to us.

1:15:58.280 --> 1:16:00.360
 We can actually read them.

1:16:00.360 --> 1:16:02.920
 And she integrates the philosophy

1:16:02.920 --> 1:16:06.040
 in what I think are amazing ways with psychology,

1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:09.480
 with history, with economics, with politics,

1:16:09.480 --> 1:16:11.440
 with what's going on in the world.

1:16:11.440 --> 1:16:14.640
 And she has dozens and dozens and dozens of essays

1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:16.240
 that she wrote.

1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:19.760
 Many of them were aggregated into books.

1:16:19.760 --> 1:16:21.640
 I particularly recommend books like

1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:25.160
 The Virtue of Selfishness,

1:16:25.160 --> 1:16:27.360
 Capitalism, The Unknown Ideal,

1:16:28.760 --> 1:16:32.120
 and Philosophy Who Needs It.

1:16:32.120 --> 1:16:37.120
 And I think it's a beautiful philosophy.

1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:38.960
 I know you're big on love.

1:16:38.960 --> 1:16:41.600
 I think it's the philosophy of love.

1:16:41.600 --> 1:16:42.600
 We can talk about that.

1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:44.120
 Essentially, it's about love.

1:16:44.120 --> 1:16:45.640
 That's what the philosophy is all about

1:16:45.640 --> 1:16:48.120
 in terms of it applying to self.

1:16:49.120 --> 1:16:54.120
 And I think it's sad that so few people read it

1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:57.400
 and so few intellectuals take it seriously

1:16:57.400 --> 1:16:58.720
 and are willing to engage with it.

1:16:58.720 --> 1:17:01.960
 Let me ask, that was incredible.

1:17:01.960 --> 1:17:04.280
 But after that beautiful whirlwind overview,

1:17:04.280 --> 1:17:06.240
 let me ask the most shallow of questions,

1:17:06.240 --> 1:17:09.400
 which is the name Objectivism.

1:17:12.840 --> 1:17:16.600
 How should people think about the name being rooted?

1:17:16.600 --> 1:17:18.120
 Why not individualism?

1:17:18.120 --> 1:17:19.280
 What are the options?

1:17:19.280 --> 1:17:21.200
 If we had a branding meeting right now.

1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:22.040
 Sure.

1:17:22.040 --> 1:17:23.880
 So she actually had a branding meeting.

1:17:23.880 --> 1:17:24.920
 So she did this.

1:17:24.920 --> 1:17:25.960
 She went through the exercise.

1:17:25.960 --> 1:17:27.640
 Objectivism, I do not think,

1:17:27.640 --> 1:17:28.880
 I don't know all the details,

1:17:28.880 --> 1:17:32.000
 but I don't think Objectivism was the first name

1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:32.840
 she came with.

1:17:32.840 --> 1:17:35.280
 The problem was that the other names were taken

1:17:35.280 --> 1:17:38.240
 and they were not positive implications.

1:17:38.240 --> 1:17:41.240
 So for example, rationalism could have been a good word

1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:45.200
 because she's an advocate of rational thought or reasonism,

1:17:45.200 --> 1:17:47.320
 but reasonism sounds weird, right?

1:17:47.320 --> 1:17:50.080
 The ism because of too many Ss, I guess.

1:17:50.080 --> 1:17:52.920
 Rationalism, but it was already a philosophy

1:17:52.920 --> 1:17:55.440
 and it was a philosophy inconsistent with hers

1:17:55.440 --> 1:17:59.040
 because it was what she considered a false view

1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:01.080
 of reason, of rationality.

1:18:01.080 --> 1:18:04.440
 Reality ism, you know, just doesn't work.

1:18:04.440 --> 1:18:06.320
 So she came on Objectivism.

1:18:06.320 --> 1:18:10.120
 And I think actually, it's a great word.

1:18:10.120 --> 1:18:15.120
 It's a great name because it has two aspects to it.

1:18:15.400 --> 1:18:16.440
 And this is a unique view

1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:18.400
 of what objectivity actually means.

1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:22.360
 In Objectivism, in objectivity is the idea

1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:24.760
 of an independent reality.

1:18:24.760 --> 1:18:26.080
 There is truth.

1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:28.640
 There's actually something out there that we,

1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:32.440
 and then there's the role of consciousness, right?

1:18:32.440 --> 1:18:36.160
 There is the role of figuring out the truth.

1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:39.120
 The truth doesn't just hit you.

1:18:40.040 --> 1:18:42.880
 The truth is not in the thing.

1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:44.440
 You have to discover it.

1:18:44.440 --> 1:18:48.160
 It's that a consciousness applied to,

1:18:49.560 --> 1:18:51.880
 that's what objectivity is, right?

1:18:51.880 --> 1:18:55.880
 It's you discovering the truth in reality.

1:18:55.880 --> 1:18:57.320
 It's your consciousness.

1:18:57.320 --> 1:19:00.160
 It's your consciousness interacting.

1:19:00.160 --> 1:19:02.600
 And thereby posing the individual in that sense.

1:19:02.600 --> 1:19:03.800
 And only the individual could do it.

1:19:03.800 --> 1:19:06.160
 Now, the problem with individualism

1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:09.960
 is it would have made the philosophy too political.

1:19:09.960 --> 1:19:10.880
 Right.

1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:13.760
 And she always said, so she said,

1:19:13.760 --> 1:19:15.640
 she said, I'm an advocate of capitalism

1:19:16.600 --> 1:19:19.400
 because I'm really an advocate for rational egoism.

1:19:20.360 --> 1:19:23.640
 But I'm a advocate for rational egoism

1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:26.040
 really because I'm an advocate for reason.

1:19:26.040 --> 1:19:28.960
 So she viewed the essential of her philosophy

1:19:28.960 --> 1:19:33.960
 as being this reason and her particular view of reason.

1:19:34.800 --> 1:19:35.640
 And she has a whole book.

1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:36.680
 She has a book called

1:19:36.680 --> 1:19:39.400
 Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology,

1:19:39.400 --> 1:19:42.120
 which I encourage any scientist, mathematician,

1:19:42.120 --> 1:19:43.720
 anybody interested in science to read

1:19:43.720 --> 1:19:46.480
 because it is a tour de force on,

1:19:48.240 --> 1:19:52.960
 in a sense, what it means to hold concepts

1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:56.880
 and what it means to discover new discoveries

1:19:56.880 --> 1:20:01.880
 and to use concepts and how we use concepts.

1:20:03.160 --> 1:20:08.160
 And she has a theory of concepts that is completely new,

1:20:09.160 --> 1:20:11.200
 that is completely revolutionary.

1:20:11.200 --> 1:20:14.320
 And I think is essential for the philosophy of science.

1:20:14.320 --> 1:20:16.000
 And therefore, ultimately,

1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:18.800
 the more abstract we get with scientific discoveries,

1:20:18.800 --> 1:20:22.160
 the easier it is to detach them from reality

1:20:22.160 --> 1:20:24.320
 and to detach them from truth,

1:20:24.320 --> 1:20:26.720
 the easier it is to be inside our heads

1:20:26.720 --> 1:20:29.480
 instead of about what's real.

1:20:30.360 --> 1:20:31.400
 And there are probably examples

1:20:31.400 --> 1:20:33.840
 from modern physics that fit that.

1:20:33.840 --> 1:20:36.760
 And I think what she teaches in the book

1:20:36.760 --> 1:20:38.680
 is how to ground your concepts

1:20:38.680 --> 1:20:41.520
 and how to bring them into grounding in reality.

1:20:41.520 --> 1:20:43.520
 So Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology,

1:20:43.520 --> 1:20:45.400
 note that it's only an introduction

1:20:45.400 --> 1:20:46.960
 because one of the things she realized,

1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:49.320
 one of the things that I think a lot of her critics

1:20:49.320 --> 1:20:51.080
 don't give enough credit for,

1:20:51.080 --> 1:20:55.040
 is that philosophy is, there's no end, right?

1:20:55.040 --> 1:20:57.360
 It's always growing, there are always new discoveries.

1:20:57.360 --> 1:20:59.480
 There's always, it's like science,

1:20:59.480 --> 1:21:00.520
 there's always new things.

1:21:00.520 --> 1:21:05.520
 And there's a ton of work to do in philosophy,

1:21:06.520 --> 1:21:08.640
 and particularly in epistemology and the theory of knowledge.

1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:10.000
 And she was actually,

1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:11.320
 given your interest in mathematics,

1:21:11.320 --> 1:21:14.600
 she actually saw a lot of parallels

1:21:14.600 --> 1:21:17.320
 between math and concept formation.

1:21:18.520 --> 1:21:22.520
 And she was actually, in the years before she died,

1:21:22.520 --> 1:21:24.960
 she was taking private lessons in mathematics,

1:21:24.960 --> 1:21:27.800
 in algebra and calculus,

1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:30.280
 because she believed that there was real insight

1:21:30.280 --> 1:21:32.560
 in understanding algebra in calculus

1:21:32.560 --> 1:21:37.560
 to philosophy and to epistemology.

1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:41.760
 And she also was very interested in neuroscience

1:21:41.760 --> 1:21:44.760
 because she believed that that had a lot to tell us

1:21:44.760 --> 1:21:48.080
 about epistemology, but also about music,

1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:50.000
 therefore about aesthetics.

1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:54.800
 So, I mean, she recognized the importance

1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:56.200
 of all these different fields

1:21:56.200 --> 1:21:58.000
 and the beauty of philosophy

1:21:58.000 --> 1:21:59.960
 is it should be integrating all of them.

1:21:59.960 --> 1:22:02.400
 And one of the sad things about the world in which we live

1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:04.720
 is again, we view these things as silos.

1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:06.200
 We don't view them as integrating.

1:22:06.200 --> 1:22:10.000
 We don't have teams of people from different arena,

1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:13.120
 you know, different fields, you know, discovering things.

1:22:13.120 --> 1:22:16.840
 We become like ants, specialized.

1:22:16.840 --> 1:22:19.480
 So she was definitely like that.

1:22:19.480 --> 1:22:21.840
 And she was constantly curious,

1:22:21.840 --> 1:22:25.680
 constantly interested in new discoveries and new ideas

1:22:25.680 --> 1:22:30.200
 and how this could expand the scope of her philosophy

1:22:30.200 --> 1:22:31.640
 and the application of her philosophy.

1:22:31.640 --> 1:22:33.520
 There's like a million topics I could talk to you,

1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:35.160
 but since you mentioned math, I'm almost curious.

1:22:35.160 --> 1:22:36.240
 We only got three hours.

1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:37.080
 Oh, okay.

1:22:37.080 --> 1:22:40.720
 I'm almost curious.

1:22:40.720 --> 1:22:41.640
 I don't know if you're familiar

1:22:41.640 --> 1:22:44.160
 with Gayle's incompleteness theorem.

1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:45.080
 I'm not, unfortunately.

1:22:45.080 --> 1:22:45.920
 Okay.

1:22:45.920 --> 1:22:50.920
 It was a powerful proof that any axiomatic systems,

1:22:51.120 --> 1:22:53.840
 when you start from a bunch of axioms,

1:22:53.840 --> 1:22:57.880
 that there will, in that system,

1:22:57.880 --> 1:23:00.920
 provably must be an inconsistency.

1:23:00.920 --> 1:23:04.520
 So that was this painful like stab

1:23:04.520 --> 1:23:07.440
 in the idea of mathematics that, no,

1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:09.960
 if we start with a set of assumptions,

1:23:09.960 --> 1:23:12.960
 kind of like Ayn Rand started with objectivism,

1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:16.540
 there will have to be at least one contradiction.

1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:21.000
 See, I intuitively am gonna say that's false.

1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:25.320
 Philosophically, but in math, it's just true.

1:23:25.320 --> 1:23:26.160
 And that's...

1:23:26.160 --> 1:23:28.240
 It's a question about how you define,

1:23:28.240 --> 1:23:30.200
 again, definitions matter,

1:23:30.200 --> 1:23:32.800
 and you have to be careful on how you define axioms.

1:23:32.800 --> 1:23:34.880
 And you have to be careful about what you define

1:23:34.880 --> 1:23:36.880
 as an inconsistency and what that means

1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:38.520
 to say there's an inconsistency.

1:23:38.520 --> 1:23:39.360
 And I don't know.

1:23:39.360 --> 1:23:40.200
 I'm not gonna say more than that,

1:23:40.200 --> 1:23:41.360
 because I don't know.

1:23:41.360 --> 1:23:46.360
 But I'm suspicious that there is some...

1:23:46.360 --> 1:23:47.600
 And this is the power of philosophy.

1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:49.000
 And this is why I said before,

1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:50.560
 concept formation is so important.

1:23:50.560 --> 1:23:52.960
 And understanding concept formation is so important,

1:23:52.960 --> 1:23:54.200
 for particularly, again, mathematics,

1:23:54.200 --> 1:23:55.840
 because it's such an abstract field.

1:23:55.840 --> 1:24:00.280
 And it's so easy to lose grounding in reality

1:24:00.280 --> 1:24:03.680
 that if you properly define axioms,

1:24:03.680 --> 1:24:05.600
 and you properly define what you're doing in math,

1:24:05.600 --> 1:24:06.520
 whether that is true.

1:24:06.520 --> 1:24:08.240
 And I don't think it is.

1:24:08.240 --> 1:24:09.080
 This is a...

1:24:09.080 --> 1:24:11.160
 Yeah, we'll leave it as an open mystery,

1:24:11.160 --> 1:24:13.460
 because actually, this audience,

1:24:14.720 --> 1:24:19.000
 there's literally over 100,000 people that have PhDs.

1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:21.360
 So they know Gaydo's The Compliance Theorem.

1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:25.040
 I have this intuition that there's something different

1:24:25.040 --> 1:24:27.240
 to mathematics and philosophy

1:24:27.240 --> 1:24:28.880
 that I'd love to hear from people.

1:24:28.880 --> 1:24:31.480
 Like, what exactly is that difference?

1:24:31.480 --> 1:24:36.000
 Because there's a precision to mathematics

1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:39.100
 that philosophy doesn't have,

1:24:39.100 --> 1:24:42.680
 but that precision gets you in trouble.

1:24:42.680 --> 1:24:46.340
 It somehow, it actually takes you away from truth.

1:24:46.340 --> 1:24:49.840
 Like, the very constraints of the language used

1:24:49.840 --> 1:24:53.400
 in mathematics actually puts a constraint

1:24:53.400 --> 1:24:56.160
 on the capture of truth that it's able to do.

1:24:56.160 --> 1:25:00.520
 I'm gonna argue that that is a total product

1:25:00.520 --> 1:25:02.800
 of the way you're conceptualizing

1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:05.720
 the terms within mathematics.

1:25:05.720 --> 1:25:07.640
 It's not in reality.

1:25:07.640 --> 1:25:10.440
 Yeah, so you would argue it's in the fact

1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:13.760
 that mathematics, in as much as it's detached from reality,

1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:15.200
 that you can do these kinds of things.

1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:20.200
 Yes, and that mathematicians have come up with concepts

1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:25.200
 that they haven't grounded in reality properly

1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:28.200
 that allows them to go off in places

1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:29.960
 that don't lead to truth.

1:25:29.960 --> 1:25:31.480
 That's right, that don't lead to truth.

1:25:31.480 --> 1:25:34.280
 But I encourage you then, I encourage you

1:25:34.280 --> 1:25:38.800
 to do one of these podcasts with one of our philosophers

1:25:38.800 --> 1:25:42.200
 who know more about this stuff.

1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:43.680
 And if you move to Austin,

1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:45.640
 I've got somebody I'd recommend to you.

1:25:45.640 --> 1:25:47.960
 And I'd love to hear from you.

1:25:47.960 --> 1:25:50.320
 I've got somebody I'd recommend to you.

1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:51.920
 Can you throw a name out, or no?

1:25:51.920 --> 1:25:54.600
 Yeah, I mean, I would talk to Greg Saumieri.

1:25:54.600 --> 1:25:58.200
 When you say our, can you say what you mean by our?

1:25:58.200 --> 1:26:00.600
 I'd say people who are affiliated

1:26:00.600 --> 1:26:02.720
 with the Ironman Institute are philosophers

1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:05.200
 who are affiliated with objectivism.

1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:08.720
 And Greg is one of our brightest, and he's in Austin.

1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:11.560
 He's just got a position at UT,

1:26:11.560 --> 1:26:13.720
 so at the University of Texas.

1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:16.200
 And he would want, Ankar Gatte would be another one

1:26:16.200 --> 1:26:19.160
 who works at the Institute and a chief philosophy officer

1:26:19.160 --> 1:26:20.000
 at the Institute.

1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:20.840
 That's awesome.

1:26:20.840 --> 1:26:24.520
 And there are others who specialize in philosophy

1:26:24.520 --> 1:26:28.720
 of science who I think Greg could probably give you a lead.

1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:31.320
 But these are unbelievably smart people

1:26:31.320 --> 1:26:34.480
 who know this part of the philosophy much better than I do.

1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:36.640
 What, can you just briefly perhaps say

1:26:36.640 --> 1:26:38.560
 what is the Ironman Institute?

1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:41.400
 Yeah, so the Ironman Institute was an organization founded

1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:44.760
 three years after Ironman died.

1:26:44.760 --> 1:26:47.480
 She died in 1982.

1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:51.160
 And it was founded in 1985 to promote her ideas,

1:26:51.160 --> 1:26:54.160
 to make sure that her ideas and her novels

1:26:55.240 --> 1:26:58.320
 continued in the culture and were relevant.

1:26:58.320 --> 1:27:01.880
 Well, they're relevant, but the people saw the relevance.

1:27:01.880 --> 1:27:04.320
 So our mission is to get people to read her books,

1:27:04.320 --> 1:27:06.320
 to engage in the ideas.

1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:10.080
 We teach, we have the Objectivist Academic Center

1:27:10.080 --> 1:27:12.760
 where we teach the philosophy,

1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:14.800
 primarily to graduate students and others

1:27:14.800 --> 1:27:15.880
 who take their ideas seriously

1:27:15.880 --> 1:27:20.880
 and who really want a deep understanding of the philosophy.

1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:22.680
 And we apply the ideas.

1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:25.080
 So we take the ideas and apply them to ethics,

1:27:25.080 --> 1:27:28.200
 to philosophy, to issues of the day,

1:27:28.200 --> 1:27:31.160
 which is more my strength and more what I tend to do.

1:27:31.160 --> 1:27:34.760
 I've never formally studied philosophy.

1:27:34.760 --> 1:27:39.640
 So all my education philosophy is informal.

1:27:39.640 --> 1:27:43.360
 And I'm an engineer and a finance guy.

1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:44.600
 That's my background.

1:27:44.600 --> 1:27:45.760
 So I'm a numbers guy.

1:27:45.760 --> 1:27:49.720
 Well, let me, I feel pretty undereducated.

1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:54.840
 I have a pretty open mind,

1:27:54.840 --> 1:27:57.120
 which sometimes can be painful on the internet

1:27:57.120 --> 1:28:00.820
 because people mock me or,

1:28:02.760 --> 1:28:05.520
 if I say something nuanced about communism,

1:28:06.840 --> 1:28:09.120
 people immediately kind of put you in a bin

1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:10.760
 or something like that.

1:28:10.760 --> 1:28:12.660
 It hurts to be open minded to say,

1:28:12.660 --> 1:28:15.100
 I don't know, to ask the question,

1:28:15.100 --> 1:28:19.260
 why is communism or Marxism so problematic?

1:28:19.260 --> 1:28:21.920
 Why is capitalism problematic and so on?

1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:25.200
 But let me nevertheless go into that direction with you.

1:28:26.840 --> 1:28:29.820
 Maybe let's talk about capitalism a little bit.

1:28:29.820 --> 1:28:32.800
 How does Objectivism compare,

1:28:32.800 --> 1:28:36.080
 relate to the idea of capitalism?

1:28:36.080 --> 1:28:37.880
 Well, first we have to define what capitalism is.

1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:40.940
 Cause again, people use capitalism in all kinds of ways.

1:28:40.940 --> 1:28:44.000
 And I know you had Ray Dalio on your show once.

1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:46.320
 I need to listen to that episode.

1:28:46.320 --> 1:28:48.680
 But Ray has no clue what capitalism is.

1:28:48.680 --> 1:28:51.640
 And that's his big problem.

1:28:52.520 --> 1:28:56.860
 So when he says there are real problems today in capitalism,

1:28:56.860 --> 1:28:58.200
 he's not talking about capitalism.

1:28:58.200 --> 1:28:59.880
 He's talking about problems in the world today.

1:28:59.880 --> 1:29:01.440
 And I agree with many of the problems,

1:29:01.440 --> 1:29:03.400
 but they have nothing to do with capitalism.

1:29:03.400 --> 1:29:08.400
 Capitalism is a social, political, economic system

1:29:08.680 --> 1:29:13.360
 in which all property is privately owned

1:29:13.360 --> 1:29:15.280
 and in which the only role of government

1:29:15.280 --> 1:29:18.040
 is the protection of individual rights.

1:29:18.040 --> 1:29:19.920
 I think it's the ideal system.

1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:21.040
 I think it's the right system

1:29:21.040 --> 1:29:22.320
 for the reasons we talked about earlier.

1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:24.440
 It's a system that leaves you as an individual

1:29:24.440 --> 1:29:27.360
 to pursue your values, your life, your happiness,

1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:28.920
 free of coercion and force.

1:29:28.920 --> 1:29:32.120
 And you get to decide what happens to you.

1:29:32.120 --> 1:29:34.400
 And I get to decide if to help you or not, right?

1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:35.580
 Let's say you fall flat on your face.

1:29:35.580 --> 1:29:37.280
 People always say, well, what about the poor?

1:29:37.280 --> 1:29:39.840
 Well, if you care about the poor, help them.

1:29:39.840 --> 1:29:41.040
 Right.

1:29:41.040 --> 1:29:43.760
 Just don't, you know, what do you need a government for?

1:29:43.760 --> 1:29:46.920
 You know, I always ask audiences, okay,

1:29:46.920 --> 1:29:49.760
 if there's a poor kid who can't afford to go to school

1:29:49.760 --> 1:29:50.780
 and all the schools are private

1:29:50.780 --> 1:29:53.400
 because capitalism is being instituted

1:29:54.360 --> 1:29:55.200
 and he can't go to school,

1:29:55.200 --> 1:29:57.160
 would you be willing to participate in a fund

1:29:57.160 --> 1:29:58.920
 that pays for his education?

1:29:58.920 --> 1:30:00.440
 Every hand in the room goes up.

1:30:00.440 --> 1:30:02.460
 So what do you need government for?

1:30:02.460 --> 1:30:05.920
 Just let's get all the money together and pay for schooling.

1:30:05.920 --> 1:30:08.340
 So the point is that what capitalism does

1:30:08.340 --> 1:30:11.160
 is leave individuals free to make their own decisions.

1:30:11.160 --> 1:30:14.120
 And as long as they're not violating other people's rights,

1:30:14.120 --> 1:30:17.320
 in other words, as long as they're not using coercion force

1:30:17.320 --> 1:30:20.240
 on other people, then leave them alone.

1:30:20.240 --> 1:30:21.880
 And people are going to make mistakes

1:30:21.880 --> 1:30:23.100
 and people are gonna screw up their lives

1:30:23.100 --> 1:30:24.440
 and people are gonna commit suicide.

1:30:24.440 --> 1:30:27.320
 People are gonna do terrible things to themselves.

1:30:27.320 --> 1:30:29.080
 That is fundamentally their problem.

1:30:29.080 --> 1:30:30.880
 And if you want to help,

1:30:30.880 --> 1:30:33.780
 you under capitalism are free to help.

1:30:33.780 --> 1:30:35.960
 It's just the only thing that doesn't happen

1:30:35.960 --> 1:30:38.920
 under capitalism is you don't get to impose your will

1:30:38.920 --> 1:30:40.480
 on other people.

1:30:40.480 --> 1:30:41.760
 Now, how's that a bad thing?

1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:46.760
 So the question then is how does the implementation

1:30:47.320 --> 1:30:52.320
 of capitalism deviate from its ideal in practice?

1:30:54.840 --> 1:30:57.440
 I mean, this is what is the question with a lot of systems

1:30:57.440 --> 1:31:00.820
 is how does it start to then fail?

1:31:00.820 --> 1:31:05.020
 So one thing maybe you can correct me or inform me,

1:31:06.200 --> 1:31:10.480
 it seems like information is very important.

1:31:10.480 --> 1:31:15.480
 Like being able to make decisions, to be free,

1:31:15.960 --> 1:31:19.120
 you have to have access, full access

1:31:19.120 --> 1:31:23.600
 of all the information you need to make rational decisions.

1:31:23.600 --> 1:31:25.720
 No, that can't be.

1:31:25.720 --> 1:31:28.720
 Because it can be right, because none of us has full access

1:31:28.720 --> 1:31:31.200
 to all the information we need.

1:31:31.200 --> 1:31:32.320
 I mean, what does that even mean?

1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:35.640
 And how big, how much of the scope do you wanna do?

1:31:35.640 --> 1:31:36.480
 Let's just start there.

1:31:36.480 --> 1:31:37.320
 Yeah, we don't.

1:31:37.320 --> 1:31:39.780
 So you need to have access to information.

1:31:39.780 --> 1:31:41.880
 So one of the big criticisms of capitalism

1:31:41.880 --> 1:31:44.220
 is this asymmetrical information.

1:31:44.220 --> 1:31:46.760
 The drug maker has more information about the drug

1:31:46.760 --> 1:31:49.600
 than the drug buyer, pharmaceutical drugs.

1:31:50.780 --> 1:31:53.720
 True, it's a problem.

1:31:53.720 --> 1:31:55.720
 Well, I wonder if one can think about,

1:31:55.720 --> 1:31:58.040
 an entrepreneur can think about how to solve that problem.

1:31:58.040 --> 1:32:01.160
 See, I view any one of these challenges to capitalism

1:32:01.160 --> 1:32:03.560
 as an opportunity for entrepreneur to make money.

1:32:03.560 --> 1:32:04.840
 And they have the freedom to do it.

1:32:04.840 --> 1:32:07.340
 Yeah, so imagine an entrepreneur steps in and says,

1:32:07.340 --> 1:32:11.440
 I will test all the drugs that drug companies make,

1:32:11.440 --> 1:32:15.880
 and I will provide you for a fee with the answer.

1:32:15.880 --> 1:32:18.460
 And how do I know he's not gonna be corrupted?

1:32:18.460 --> 1:32:21.680
 Well, there'll be other ones and they'll compete.

1:32:21.680 --> 1:32:25.080
 And who am I to tell which one of these is the right one?

1:32:25.080 --> 1:32:26.760
 Well, it won't be you really getting

1:32:26.760 --> 1:32:28.800
 the information from them.

1:32:28.800 --> 1:32:30.520
 It'll be your doctor.

1:32:30.520 --> 1:32:32.220
 The doctors need that information.

1:32:33.140 --> 1:32:35.960
 So the doctor who has some expertise in medicine

1:32:35.960 --> 1:32:39.240
 will be evaluating which rating agency to use

1:32:39.240 --> 1:32:41.460
 to evaluate the drugs and which ones then

1:32:41.460 --> 1:32:43.040
 to recommend to you.

1:32:43.040 --> 1:32:45.440
 So do we need an FDA?

1:32:45.440 --> 1:32:48.320
 Do we need a government that siphons all the information

1:32:48.320 --> 1:32:51.040
 to one source that does all the research, all the thing,

1:32:51.040 --> 1:32:52.960
 and has a clear incentive, by the way,

1:32:52.960 --> 1:32:55.020
 not to approve drugs.

1:32:55.020 --> 1:32:57.480
 Because they don't make any money from it.

1:32:57.480 --> 1:32:59.200
 Nobody pays them for the information.

1:32:59.200 --> 1:33:00.680
 Nobody pays them to be accurate.

1:33:00.680 --> 1:33:02.400
 They're bureaucrats at the end of the day.

1:33:02.400 --> 1:33:04.080
 And what is a bureaucrat?

1:33:04.080 --> 1:33:06.640
 What's the main focus of a bureaucrat?

1:33:06.640 --> 1:33:08.960
 Even if they go in with the best of intentions,

1:33:08.960 --> 1:33:10.800
 which I'm sure all the scientists at the FDA

1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:13.320
 have the best of intentions, what's their incentive?

1:33:13.320 --> 1:33:17.020
 The system builds in this incentive not to screw up.

1:33:17.020 --> 1:33:21.960
 Because one drug gets value and does damage,

1:33:21.960 --> 1:33:23.760
 you lose your job.

1:33:23.760 --> 1:33:26.800
 But if a hundred drugs that could cure cancer tomorrow

1:33:26.800 --> 1:33:29.060
 don't ever get to market,

1:33:29.060 --> 1:33:31.520
 nobody's gonna come after you.

1:33:31.520 --> 1:33:32.360
 Yeah.

1:33:32.360 --> 1:33:35.760
 And you're saying that's not a mechanism,

1:33:35.760 --> 1:33:38.200
 and that's conducive to like...

1:33:38.200 --> 1:33:39.400
 You see, the marketplace is competition.

1:33:39.400 --> 1:33:41.160
 So if you won't approve the drug,

1:33:41.160 --> 1:33:43.720
 if I still think it's possible, I will.

1:33:43.720 --> 1:33:45.200
 And it's not zero one.

1:33:45.200 --> 1:33:47.160
 You see the other thing that happens with the FDA

1:33:47.160 --> 1:33:48.000
 is it's zero one.

1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:50.320
 It's either approved or it's not approved.

1:33:50.320 --> 1:33:52.540
 Oh, it's approved for this, but it's not approved for that.

1:33:52.540 --> 1:33:56.960
 But what if a drug came out and you said, right?

1:33:56.960 --> 1:33:58.060
 You told the doctors,

1:33:59.160 --> 1:34:04.160
 this drug in 10% of the cases can cause patients

1:34:05.080 --> 1:34:07.480
 an increased risk of heart disease.

1:34:07.480 --> 1:34:09.640
 You and your patients should,

1:34:09.640 --> 1:34:12.600
 we're not forcing you, but you should, right?

1:34:12.600 --> 1:34:15.440
 It's your medical responsibility to evaluate that

1:34:15.440 --> 1:34:17.420
 and decide if the drug is appropriate or not.

1:34:17.420 --> 1:34:19.040
 Why don't I get to make that choice

1:34:19.040 --> 1:34:21.720
 if I wanna take on the 10% risk of heart disease?

1:34:21.720 --> 1:34:24.480
 So there was a drug, and right now I forget the name,

1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:26.320
 but it was a drug against pain,

1:34:26.320 --> 1:34:29.280
 particularly for arthritic pain, and it worked.

1:34:29.280 --> 1:34:31.560
 It reduced pain dramatically, right?

1:34:31.560 --> 1:34:33.220
 And some people tried everything,

1:34:33.220 --> 1:34:35.760
 and this was the only drug that reduced their pain.

1:34:35.760 --> 1:34:39.320
 And it turned out that in 10% of the cases,

1:34:39.320 --> 1:34:42.160
 it caused the elevated risk.

1:34:42.160 --> 1:34:43.880
 It didn't kill people necessarily,

1:34:43.880 --> 1:34:46.040
 but it caused elevated risk of heart disease.

1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:49.040
 Okay, what did the FDA do?

1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:50.000
 It banned the drug.

1:34:50.880 --> 1:34:53.560
 Some people, I know a lot of people who said

1:34:53.560 --> 1:34:58.400
 living with pain is much worse than taking on a 10% risk.

1:34:58.400 --> 1:34:59.520
 Again, probabilities, right?

1:34:59.520 --> 1:35:01.320
 People don't think in those numbers.

1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:03.160
 10% risk of maybe getting heart disease.

1:35:03.160 --> 1:35:04.620
 Why don't I get to make that choice?

1:35:04.620 --> 1:35:07.480
 Why does some bureaucrat make that choice for me?

1:35:07.480 --> 1:35:08.840
 That's capitalism.

1:35:08.840 --> 1:35:11.100
 Capitalism gives you the choice,

1:35:11.100 --> 1:35:13.080
 not you as an ignorant person.

1:35:13.080 --> 1:35:17.040
 You with your doctor and a whole marketplace,

1:35:17.040 --> 1:35:20.100
 which is not created to provide you with information.

1:35:20.100 --> 1:35:23.680
 And think about a world where we didn't have

1:35:23.680 --> 1:35:25.780
 all these regulations and controls.

1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:31.960
 The amount of opportunities that would exist

1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:35.000
 to create, to provide information,

1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:36.920
 to educate you about that information,

1:35:36.920 --> 1:35:39.520
 would mushroom dramatically.

1:35:39.520 --> 1:35:40.980
 Bloomberg, you know, the billionaire,

1:35:40.980 --> 1:35:42.960
 Bloomberg, you know, how did he make his money?

1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:45.560
 He made his money by providing financial information,

1:35:45.560 --> 1:35:47.480
 by creating this service called Bloomberg

1:35:47.480 --> 1:35:49.560
 that you buy a terminal and you get

1:35:49.560 --> 1:35:50.840
 all this amazing information.

1:35:50.840 --> 1:35:53.720
 And he was before computers, desktop computers.

1:35:53.720 --> 1:35:55.240
 I mean, he was very early on

1:35:55.240 --> 1:35:57.360
 in that whole computing revolution,

1:35:57.360 --> 1:35:59.800
 but his focus was providing financial information

1:35:59.800 --> 1:36:00.720
 to professionals.

1:36:02.040 --> 1:36:04.380
 And you hire a professional to manage your money.

1:36:04.380 --> 1:36:05.880
 That's the way it's supposed to be.

1:36:05.880 --> 1:36:08.400
 You know, you have to have,

1:36:08.400 --> 1:36:11.160
 so you as an individual cannot have

1:36:11.160 --> 1:36:12.800
 all the knowledge you need in medicine,

1:36:12.800 --> 1:36:14.080
 all the knowledge you need in finance,

1:36:14.080 --> 1:36:16.240
 all the knowledge you need in every aspect of your life.

1:36:16.240 --> 1:36:17.240
 You can't do that.

1:36:17.240 --> 1:36:21.120
 You have to delegate and you hire a doctor.

1:36:21.120 --> 1:36:23.040
 Now you should be able to figure out

1:36:23.040 --> 1:36:24.180
 if the doctor's good or not.

1:36:24.180 --> 1:36:26.800
 You should be able to ask doctors for reasons

1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:28.920
 for why you have to make the decision at the end.

1:36:28.920 --> 1:36:29.760
 But that's why you have a doctor.

1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:31.040
 That's why you have a financial advisor.

1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:32.800
 That's why you have different people

1:36:32.800 --> 1:36:36.400
 who you're delegating certain aspects of your life to,

1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:38.400
 but you want choices.

1:36:38.400 --> 1:36:41.520
 And what the marketplace provides is those choices.

1:36:41.520 --> 1:36:44.120
 So let me then,

1:36:44.120 --> 1:36:45.520
 this is what I do.

1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:47.640
 I'll make a dumb case for things

1:36:47.640 --> 1:36:48.920
 and then you shut me down

1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:51.120
 and then the internet says how dumb Lex is.

1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:51.940
 This is good.

1:36:51.940 --> 1:36:52.780
 This is how it works.

1:36:52.780 --> 1:36:57.400
 I'm good at shutting down and they're foolish

1:36:57.400 --> 1:36:59.820
 in blaming you for the question

1:36:59.820 --> 1:37:02.840
 because you're here to ask me questions.

1:37:02.840 --> 1:37:06.640
 Let me make a case for socialism.

1:37:06.640 --> 1:37:08.680
 So.

1:37:09.640 --> 1:37:11.640
 It's gonna be bad because that's the only case

1:37:11.640 --> 1:37:12.720
 there is for socialism.

1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:13.640
 That's reality.

1:37:13.640 --> 1:37:16.880
 So perhaps it's not a case for socialism,

1:37:16.880 --> 1:37:21.800
 but just a certain notion that inequality,

1:37:22.760 --> 1:37:24.320
 the wealth inequality,

1:37:24.320 --> 1:37:28.120
 that the bigger the gap between the poorest

1:37:28.120 --> 1:37:30.400
 or the average and the richest,

1:37:30.400 --> 1:37:34.960
 the more painful it is to be average.

1:37:34.960 --> 1:37:36.960
 Psychologically speaking,

1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:41.520
 if you know that there is the CEOs of companies

1:37:41.520 --> 1:37:45.940
 make 300, 1000, 1 million times more than you do,

1:37:45.940 --> 1:37:50.480
 that makes life for a large part of the population

1:37:50.480 --> 1:37:51.560
 less fulfilling.

1:37:51.560 --> 1:37:55.200
 That there's a relative notion to the experience of our life

1:37:55.200 --> 1:37:58.160
 that even though everybody's life has gotten better

1:37:58.160 --> 1:38:02.000
 over the past decades and centuries,

1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:05.240
 it may feel actually worse

1:38:05.240 --> 1:38:08.160
 because you know that life could be so,

1:38:08.160 --> 1:38:11.920
 so much better in the life of the CEOs

1:38:11.920 --> 1:38:16.920
 that yeah, that gap is fundamentally a thing

1:38:17.200 --> 1:38:19.700
 that is undesirable in a society.

1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:22.700
 Everything about that is wrong.

1:38:22.700 --> 1:38:25.040
 Okay.

1:38:25.040 --> 1:38:27.040
 I like to start off like that.

1:38:27.040 --> 1:38:30.480
 Which, so I mean,

1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:32.200
 so my wife likes to remind me

1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:36.080
 that as well as we've done in life,

1:38:36.080 --> 1:38:38.200
 we are actually from a wealth perspective

1:38:38.200 --> 1:38:41.080
 closer to a homeless person than we are to Bill Gates.

1:38:41.080 --> 1:38:42.080
 Just a math, right?

1:38:42.080 --> 1:38:43.080
 Just a math, right?

1:38:44.840 --> 1:38:46.120
 It's a good ego check.

1:38:46.120 --> 1:38:47.800
 When I look at Bill Gates,

1:38:47.800 --> 1:38:49.240
 I get a smile on my face.

1:38:49.240 --> 1:38:50.080
 I love Bill Gates.

1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:51.360
 I've never met Bill Gates.

1:38:51.360 --> 1:38:52.400
 I love Bill Gates.

1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:54.760
 I love what he stands for.

1:38:54.760 --> 1:38:57.560
 I love that he has $100 billion.

1:38:57.560 --> 1:39:01.120
 I love that he has built a trampoline room in his house

1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:03.520
 where his kids can jump up and down in a trampoline

1:39:03.520 --> 1:39:04.880
 in a safe environment.

1:39:04.880 --> 1:39:06.600
 Can we take another billionaire?

1:39:06.600 --> 1:39:09.380
 Because I'm not sure if you're paying attention,

1:39:09.380 --> 1:39:12.340
 but there's all kinds of conspiracy theories

1:39:12.340 --> 1:39:13.800
 about Bill Gates.

1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:15.540
 Well, but that's part of the story, right?

1:39:15.540 --> 1:39:16.740
 They have to pull him down

1:39:16.740 --> 1:39:19.080
 because people resent him for other reasons.

1:39:19.080 --> 1:39:19.920
 That's strange.

1:39:19.920 --> 1:39:21.500
 But yes, we can take Jeff Bezos.

1:39:21.500 --> 1:39:24.880
 We can say my favorite, historically,

1:39:24.880 --> 1:39:28.740
 just because I like a lot about him, was Steve Jobs.

1:39:30.600 --> 1:39:32.720
 I mean, I love these people.

1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:36.340
 And I can't, there are very few billionaires I don't love.

1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:40.160
 In the sense that I appreciate everything they've done

1:39:40.160 --> 1:39:45.160
 for me, for people I cherish and love,

1:39:46.020 --> 1:39:48.360
 they've made the world a better place.

1:39:48.360 --> 1:39:49.800
 Why?

1:39:49.800 --> 1:39:54.800
 Would it ever cross my mind that they make me look bad

1:39:54.900 --> 1:39:55.920
 because they're richer than me

1:39:55.920 --> 1:39:58.360
 or that I don't have what they have?

1:39:58.360 --> 1:40:02.520
 They've made me so much richer

1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:08.040
 that they've made inventions that used to cost millions

1:40:08.040 --> 1:40:12.120
 and millions and millions of dollars accessible to me.

1:40:12.120 --> 1:40:15.960
 I mean, this is a supercomputer in my pocket.

1:40:16.920 --> 1:40:18.540
 Now, but think about it, right?

1:40:18.540 --> 1:40:20.080
 What is the difference between,

1:40:20.080 --> 1:40:22.560
 and I'll get to the essence of your point in a minute,

1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:24.680
 but think about what the difference is

1:40:24.680 --> 1:40:27.600
 between me and Bill Gates in terms of,

1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:29.360
 because it's true that in terms of wealth,

1:40:29.360 --> 1:40:30.840
 I'm closer to the homeless person,

1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:32.920
 but in terms of my day to day life,

1:40:32.920 --> 1:40:34.880
 I'm closer to Bill Gates.

1:40:34.880 --> 1:40:36.880
 You know, we both live in a nice house.

1:40:36.880 --> 1:40:39.240
 His is nicer, but we live in a nice house.

1:40:39.240 --> 1:40:42.160
 His is bigger, but mine is plenty big.

1:40:42.160 --> 1:40:43.640
 We both drive cars.

1:40:43.640 --> 1:40:45.840
 His is nicer, but we both drive cars.

1:40:45.840 --> 1:40:50.160
 We both drive cars, cars, 100 years ago, what cars?

1:40:50.160 --> 1:40:54.280
 We both can fly, get on a plane in Los Angeles

1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:57.060
 and fly to New York and get there in about the same time.

1:40:57.060 --> 1:40:58.480
 We're both flying private.

1:40:59.400 --> 1:41:01.240
 The only difference is my private plane

1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:04.720
 I share with 300 other people and his,

1:41:04.720 --> 1:41:07.120
 but it's accessible.

1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:08.680
 It's relatively comfortable.

1:41:08.680 --> 1:41:11.360
 Again, in the perspective of 50 years ago, 100 years ago,

1:41:11.360 --> 1:41:14.040
 it's unimaginable that I could fly like that

1:41:14.040 --> 1:41:15.480
 for such a low fee.

1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:18.840
 We live very similar lives in that sense.

1:41:18.840 --> 1:41:20.160
 So I don't resent him.

1:41:20.160 --> 1:41:23.800
 So first of all, I'm an exception to the supposed rule

1:41:23.800 --> 1:41:24.840
 that people resent.

1:41:24.840 --> 1:41:26.800
 I don't think anybody, I don't think people do resent

1:41:26.800 --> 1:41:28.320
 unless they're taught to resent.

1:41:28.320 --> 1:41:29.680
 And this is the key.

1:41:29.680 --> 1:41:33.120
 People are taught and I've seen this in America.

1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:37.520
 And this is to me the most horrible shocking thing

1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:40.400
 that has happened in America over the last 40 years.

1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:42.320
 I came to America, so I'm an immigrant.

1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:45.720
 I came to America from Israel in 1987.

1:41:45.720 --> 1:41:48.400
 And I came here because I thought this was the place

1:41:48.400 --> 1:41:50.840
 where I could, where I'd had the most opportunities

1:41:50.840 --> 1:41:52.880
 and it is, most opportunities.

1:41:52.880 --> 1:41:54.280
 And I came here because I believed

1:41:54.280 --> 1:41:58.820
 there was a certain American spirit of individualism

1:41:58.820 --> 1:42:01.120
 and exactly the opposite of what you just described.

1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:06.120
 A sense of I live my life, it's my happiness.

1:42:06.320 --> 1:42:07.640
 I'm not looking at my neighbor.

1:42:07.640 --> 1:42:09.560
 I'm not competing with the Joneses.

1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:11.680
 The American dream is my dream.

1:42:11.680 --> 1:42:14.540
 My two kids, my dog, my station wagon.

1:42:14.540 --> 1:42:17.480
 Not because other people have it, it's because I want it.

1:42:17.480 --> 1:42:20.820
 In that sense, and when I came here in the 80s,

1:42:21.740 --> 1:42:22.800
 you had that.

1:42:22.800 --> 1:42:25.220
 You had, you still had it.

1:42:25.220 --> 1:42:28.080
 It was less than I think it had been in the past.

1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:29.440
 But you had that spirit.

1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:30.320
 There was no envy.

1:42:30.320 --> 1:42:31.240
 There was no resentment.

1:42:31.240 --> 1:42:34.160
 There were rich people and they were celebrated.

1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:37.520
 There was still this admiration for entrepreneurs

1:42:37.520 --> 1:42:39.660
 and admiration for success.

1:42:39.660 --> 1:42:42.660
 Not by everybody, certainly not by the intellectuals,

1:42:42.660 --> 1:42:45.080
 but by the average person.

1:42:45.080 --> 1:42:47.920
 I have witnessed particularly over the last 10 years

1:42:47.920 --> 1:42:50.100
 a complete transformation

1:42:50.100 --> 1:42:52.460
 and America's become like Europe.

1:42:52.460 --> 1:42:54.220
 I know, are you Russian?

1:42:54.220 --> 1:42:55.060
 Yeah. Yeah.

1:42:55.060 --> 1:42:59.440
 It's become Russian in a sense where,

1:42:59.440 --> 1:43:02.260
 you know, they've always done these studies.

1:43:02.260 --> 1:43:05.380
 You know, I'll give you a hundred dollars

1:43:05.380 --> 1:43:06.820
 and your neighbor a hundred dollars

1:43:06.820 --> 1:43:11.480
 or I'll give you, what was it, I'll give you a thousand

1:43:11.480 --> 1:43:14.000
 dollars but your neighbor gets $10,000

1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:16.540
 and a Russian will always choose the hundred dollars, right?

1:43:16.540 --> 1:43:20.700
 He wants equality above being better himself.

1:43:20.700 --> 1:43:24.500
 Americans would always choose that gap.

1:43:24.500 --> 1:43:25.340
 And that's changing.

1:43:25.340 --> 1:43:26.760
 My sense is not anymore.

1:43:26.760 --> 1:43:31.760
 And it's changing because we've been told it should change.

1:43:32.140 --> 1:43:34.960
 And morally you're saying that doesn't make any sense.

1:43:34.960 --> 1:43:38.860
 So there's no sense in which, let me put another spin.

1:43:38.860 --> 1:43:41.740
 I forget the book, but the sense of,

1:43:41.740 --> 1:43:45.460
 if you're working for Steve Jobs and your hands,

1:43:45.460 --> 1:43:48.220
 you're the engineer behind the iPhone

1:43:48.220 --> 1:43:51.300
 and there's a sense in which his salary

1:43:51.300 --> 1:43:53.940
 is stealing from your efforts.

1:43:53.940 --> 1:43:57.300
 Because I forget the book, right?

1:43:57.300 --> 1:43:59.920
 That's literally the terminology is used, right?

1:43:59.920 --> 1:44:02.380
 This is straight out of Karl Marx.

1:44:02.380 --> 1:44:05.220
 Sure, it's also straight out of Karl Marx.

1:44:05.220 --> 1:44:08.140
 But there's no sense morally speaking

1:44:08.140 --> 1:44:09.660
 that you see that as the theft.

1:44:09.660 --> 1:44:11.020
 The other way around.

1:44:11.020 --> 1:44:12.620
 That engineer is stealing off of,

1:44:12.620 --> 1:44:14.220
 and it's not stealing, right?

1:44:14.220 --> 1:44:15.700
 It's not.

1:44:15.700 --> 1:44:18.380
 But the engineer is getting more from Steve Jobs

1:44:18.380 --> 1:44:20.420
 by a lot, not by a little bit,

1:44:20.420 --> 1:44:23.300
 than Steve Jobs is getting from the engineer.

1:44:23.300 --> 1:44:26.100
 The engineer, even if they're a great engineer,

1:44:26.100 --> 1:44:27.360
 there are probably other great engineers

1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:28.460
 that could replace him.

1:44:29.420 --> 1:44:32.120
 Would he even have a job without Steve Jobs?

1:44:32.120 --> 1:44:34.940
 Would the industry exist without Steve Jobs?

1:44:34.940 --> 1:44:38.500
 Without the giants that carry these things forward?

1:44:38.500 --> 1:44:39.340
 Let me ask you this.

1:44:39.340 --> 1:44:41.100
 I mean, you're a scientist.

1:44:41.100 --> 1:44:43.500
 Do you resent Einstein for being smarter than you?

1:44:45.840 --> 1:44:48.260
 I mean, and VM, are you angry with him?

1:44:48.260 --> 1:44:51.440
 Would you feel negative towards him

1:44:51.440 --> 1:44:52.620
 if he was in the room right now?

1:44:52.620 --> 1:44:53.980
 Or would you, if he came into the room,

1:44:53.980 --> 1:44:55.300
 you'd say, oh my God.

1:44:55.300 --> 1:44:58.220
 I mean, you interview people who I think some of them

1:44:58.220 --> 1:45:00.460
 are probably smarter than you and me.

1:45:00.460 --> 1:45:03.180
 And your attitude towards them is one of reverence.

1:45:03.180 --> 1:45:06.960
 Well, one interesting little side question there

1:45:06.960 --> 1:45:10.800
 is what is the natural state of being for us humans?

1:45:10.800 --> 1:45:15.620
 You kind of implied education has polluted our minds,

1:45:15.620 --> 1:45:19.580
 but like if I, because you're referring to jealousy,

1:45:19.580 --> 1:45:22.580
 the Einstein question, the Steve Jobs question,

1:45:22.580 --> 1:45:25.980
 I wonder which way, if we're left without education,

1:45:25.980 --> 1:45:27.460
 we would naturally go.

1:45:27.460 --> 1:45:30.060
 So there is no such thing as the natural state

1:45:30.060 --> 1:45:31.900
 in that sense, right?

1:45:31.900 --> 1:45:36.900
 This is the myth of who so is a noble savage

1:45:37.860 --> 1:45:42.460
 and of John Walls is behind the veil of ignorance.

1:45:42.460 --> 1:45:44.740
 Well, if you're ignorant, you're ignorant.

1:45:45.740 --> 1:45:47.180
 You can't make any decisions.

1:45:47.180 --> 1:45:48.220
 You're just ignorant.

1:45:50.640 --> 1:45:54.500
 There is no human nature that determines

1:45:54.500 --> 1:45:56.500
 how you will relate to other people.

1:45:56.500 --> 1:45:58.940
 You will relate to other people based on the conclusions

1:45:58.940 --> 1:46:01.900
 you come to about how to relate to other people.

1:46:01.900 --> 1:46:05.620
 You can relate to other people as values

1:46:06.860 --> 1:46:10.260
 to use your terminology from the perspective of love.

1:46:10.260 --> 1:46:13.560
 This other human being is a value to me

1:46:13.560 --> 1:46:16.380
 and I want to trade with them and trade,

1:46:16.380 --> 1:46:19.020
 the beauty of trade is it's win, win.

1:46:19.020 --> 1:46:21.420
 I want to benefit and they are going to benefit.

1:46:21.420 --> 1:46:22.580
 I don't want to screw them.

1:46:22.580 --> 1:46:24.060
 I don't want them to screw me.

1:46:24.060 --> 1:46:25.540
 I want us to be win, win.

1:46:25.540 --> 1:46:30.540
 Or you can deal with other people as threats, as enemies.

1:46:31.500 --> 1:46:33.540
 Much of human history, we have done that.

1:46:34.540 --> 1:46:37.300
 And therefore, as a zero sum world,

1:46:37.300 --> 1:46:41.860
 what they have, I want, I will take it.

1:46:41.860 --> 1:46:43.060
 I will use force to take it.

1:46:43.060 --> 1:46:44.580
 I will use political force to take it.

1:46:44.580 --> 1:46:46.180
 I will use the force of my arm to take it.

1:46:46.180 --> 1:46:47.620
 I will just take it.

1:46:47.620 --> 1:46:51.020
 So those are two options, right?

1:46:51.020 --> 1:46:52.640
 And they will determine whether we live

1:46:52.640 --> 1:46:54.580
 in civilization or not.

1:46:54.580 --> 1:46:57.420
 And they are determined by conclusions people come to

1:46:57.420 --> 1:46:59.260
 about the world and the nature of reality

1:46:59.260 --> 1:47:01.420
 and the nature of morality and the nature of politics

1:47:01.420 --> 1:47:02.780
 and all these things.

1:47:02.780 --> 1:47:05.060
 They're determined by philosophy.

1:47:05.060 --> 1:47:07.620
 And this is why philosophy is so important

1:47:07.620 --> 1:47:10.700
 because the philosophy shapes,

1:47:10.700 --> 1:47:12.340
 evolution doesn't do this.

1:47:12.340 --> 1:47:14.420
 It doesn't just happen.

1:47:14.420 --> 1:47:17.120
 Ideas shape how we relate to other people.

1:47:18.100 --> 1:47:19.880
 And you say, well, little children do it.

1:47:19.880 --> 1:47:22.540
 Well, little children don't have a frontal cortex.

1:47:22.540 --> 1:47:24.380
 It's not relevant, right?

1:47:24.380 --> 1:47:26.980
 What happens as you develop a frontal cortex,

1:47:26.980 --> 1:47:31.980
 as you develop the brain, you learn ideas.

1:47:32.140 --> 1:47:35.180
 And those ideas will shape how you relate to other people.

1:47:35.180 --> 1:47:36.980
 And if you learn good ideas,

1:47:36.980 --> 1:47:40.400
 you relate to other people in a healthy, productive win, win.

1:47:41.380 --> 1:47:43.820
 And if you develop bad ideas,

1:47:43.820 --> 1:47:47.740
 you will resent other people and you will want their stuff.

1:47:47.740 --> 1:47:50.220
 And the thing is that human progress depends

1:47:50.220 --> 1:47:52.440
 on the win, win relationship.

1:47:52.440 --> 1:47:55.440
 It depends on civilization, depends on peace.

1:47:55.440 --> 1:47:57.780
 It depends on allowing people,

1:47:57.780 --> 1:47:59.220
 going back to what we talked about earlier,

1:47:59.220 --> 1:48:02.620
 allowing people the freedom to think for themselves.

1:48:02.620 --> 1:48:05.020
 And anytime you try to interrupt that,

1:48:05.020 --> 1:48:06.140
 you're causing damage.

1:48:06.140 --> 1:48:09.420
 So this change in America is not some reversion

1:48:09.420 --> 1:48:11.340
 to a natural state.

1:48:11.340 --> 1:48:12.780
 It's a shift in ideas.

1:48:15.620 --> 1:48:19.480
 We still live, the better part of American society

1:48:19.480 --> 1:48:23.420
 and the world, still lives on the remnants

1:48:23.420 --> 1:48:27.420
 of the Enlightenment, the Enlightenment ideas,

1:48:27.420 --> 1:48:30.720
 the ideas that brought about this scientific revolution,

1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:33.060
 the ideas that brought about the creation of this country.

1:48:33.060 --> 1:48:36.420
 And it's the same basic ideas that led to both of those.

1:48:36.420 --> 1:48:41.060
 And as those ideas get more distant,

1:48:41.060 --> 1:48:43.420
 as those ideas are not defended,

1:48:43.420 --> 1:48:47.320
 as those ideas disappear, as Enlightenment goes away,

1:48:47.320 --> 1:48:52.000
 we will become more violent, more resentful,

1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:56.640
 more tribal, more obnoxious, more unpleasant,

1:48:56.640 --> 1:48:58.180
 more primitive.

1:48:58.180 --> 1:49:02.640
 A very specific example of this that bothers me,

1:49:02.640 --> 1:49:04.940
 I'd be curious to get your comment on.

1:49:04.940 --> 1:49:08.740
 So Elon Musk is a billionaire.

1:49:10.040 --> 1:49:14.720
 And one of the things that really,

1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:16.240
 maybe it's almost a pet peeve,

1:49:16.240 --> 1:49:18.480
 it really bothers me when the press

1:49:18.480 --> 1:49:21.360
 and the general public will say,

1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:24.900
 well, all those rockets they're sending up there,

1:49:24.900 --> 1:49:26.480
 those are just like the toys,

1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:28.440
 the games that billionaires play.

1:49:29.940 --> 1:49:34.940
 That to me, billionaire has become a dirty word to use,

1:49:36.480 --> 1:49:41.480
 like as if money can buy or has anything to do with genius.

1:49:41.480 --> 1:49:46.480
 I'm trying to articulate a specific line of question here

1:49:52.080 --> 1:49:53.940
 because it just bothers me.

1:49:53.940 --> 1:49:57.200
 I guess the question is how do we get here

1:49:57.200 --> 1:49:58.480
 and how do we get out of that?

1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:02.240
 Because Elon Musk is doing some of the most incredible things

1:50:02.240 --> 1:50:05.360
 that a human being has ever participated in.

1:50:05.360 --> 1:50:07.480
 Mostly, he doesn't build the rockets himself,

1:50:07.480 --> 1:50:10.480
 he's getting a bunch of other geniuses together that have.

1:50:10.480 --> 1:50:11.440
 That takes genius.

1:50:11.440 --> 1:50:12.320
 That takes genius.

1:50:12.320 --> 1:50:16.480
 But where do we go and how do we get back

1:50:16.480 --> 1:50:19.000
 to where Elon Musk is an inspiring figure

1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:23.200
 as opposed to a billionaire playing with some toys?

1:50:23.200 --> 1:50:25.120
 So this is the role of philosophy.

1:50:25.120 --> 1:50:26.560
 It goes back to the same place.

1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:28.540
 It goes back to our understanding of the world

1:50:28.540 --> 1:50:30.280
 and our role in it.

1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:32.680
 And if you understand that the only way

1:50:32.680 --> 1:50:34.840
 to become a billionaire, for example,

1:50:34.840 --> 1:50:36.200
 is to create value.

1:50:36.200 --> 1:50:37.600
 Value for whom?

1:50:37.600 --> 1:50:39.800
 Value for people who are gonna consume it.

1:50:39.800 --> 1:50:41.240
 The only way to become a billionaire,

1:50:41.240 --> 1:50:45.600
 the only way Elon Musk became a billionaire is through PayPal.

1:50:45.600 --> 1:50:47.560
 Now, PayPal is something we all use.

1:50:47.560 --> 1:50:50.040
 PayPal is an enormous value to all of us.

1:50:50.040 --> 1:50:52.680
 It's why it's worth several billions of dollars

1:50:52.680 --> 1:50:57.680
 which Elon Musk could then earn.

1:50:57.680 --> 1:51:01.640
 But you cannot become a billionaire in a free society

1:51:01.640 --> 1:51:02.920
 by exploiting people.

1:51:02.920 --> 1:51:05.840
 You cannot because you'll be laughed.

1:51:05.840 --> 1:51:06.880
 Nobody will deal with you.

1:51:06.880 --> 1:51:09.160
 Nobody will have any interactions with you.

1:51:09.160 --> 1:51:10.640
 The only way to become a billionaire

1:51:10.640 --> 1:51:14.180
 is to do billions of win, win transactions.

1:51:15.340 --> 1:51:18.440
 So the only way to become a billionaire in a free society

1:51:18.440 --> 1:51:21.720
 is to change the world to make it a better place.

1:51:21.720 --> 1:51:24.640
 Billionaires are the great humanitarians of our time,

1:51:24.640 --> 1:51:26.360
 not because they give charity,

1:51:26.360 --> 1:51:29.200
 but because they make them billions.

1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:32.760
 And it's true that money and genius

1:51:32.760 --> 1:51:35.420
 are not necessarily correlated,

1:51:35.420 --> 1:51:37.360
 but you cannot become a billionaire

1:51:37.360 --> 1:51:38.960
 without being super smart.

1:51:38.960 --> 1:51:42.380
 You cannot become a billionaire by figuring something out

1:51:42.380 --> 1:51:44.560
 that nobody else has figured out

1:51:44.560 --> 1:51:46.160
 in whatever realm it happens to be.

1:51:46.160 --> 1:51:48.400
 And that thing that you figure out

1:51:48.400 --> 1:51:50.700
 has to be something that provides immense value

1:51:50.700 --> 1:51:51.540
 to other people.

1:51:52.440 --> 1:51:54.400
 Where do we go wrong?

1:51:54.400 --> 1:51:56.760
 We go wrong, our culture goes wrong

1:51:56.760 --> 1:52:01.760
 because it views billionaires as selfish.

1:52:02.700 --> 1:52:04.120
 And there's a sense in which,

1:52:04.120 --> 1:52:06.380
 not a sense, it's absolutely true.

1:52:06.380 --> 1:52:08.680
 The billionaire doesn't ask for my opinion

1:52:08.680 --> 1:52:11.540
 on what product to launch.

1:52:11.540 --> 1:52:13.880
 Elon Musk doesn't ask others

1:52:13.880 --> 1:52:15.960
 what they think he should spend his money on,

1:52:15.960 --> 1:52:18.560
 what the greatest social wellbeing will be.

1:52:18.560 --> 1:52:21.920
 I mean, there's a sense in which the rockets are his toys.

1:52:21.920 --> 1:52:24.520
 There's a sense in which he chose

1:52:24.520 --> 1:52:28.280
 that he would be inspired the most.

1:52:28.280 --> 1:52:30.200
 He would have the most fun

1:52:30.200 --> 1:52:32.720
 by going to Mars and building rockets.

1:52:32.720 --> 1:52:34.480
 And he's probably dreamt of rockets

1:52:34.480 --> 1:52:35.440
 from when he was a kid

1:52:35.440 --> 1:52:37.400
 and probably always played with rockets.

1:52:37.400 --> 1:52:39.080
 And now he has the funds, the capital

1:52:39.080 --> 1:52:40.760
 to be able to deploy it.

1:52:40.760 --> 1:52:43.860
 So he's being selfish.

1:52:43.860 --> 1:52:45.620
 Obviously, he's being self interested.

1:52:45.620 --> 1:52:47.280
 This is what Elon Musk is about.

1:52:47.280 --> 1:52:50.440
 I mean, the same with Jeff Bezos.

1:52:50.440 --> 1:52:54.920
 There's no committee to decide whether to invest

1:52:54.920 --> 1:52:57.000
 in cloud computing or not.

1:52:57.000 --> 1:52:58.960
 Bezos decided that.

1:52:58.960 --> 1:53:00.840
 And at the end of the day,

1:53:00.840 --> 1:53:01.880
 they are the bosses,

1:53:01.880 --> 1:53:03.740
 they pursue the values they believe are good.

1:53:03.740 --> 1:53:06.080
 They create the wealth.

1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:08.960
 It's their decisions, it's their mind.

1:53:08.960 --> 1:53:10.980
 And the fact is we live in a world

1:53:10.980 --> 1:53:14.500
 where for 2000 plus years,

1:53:14.500 --> 1:53:18.160
 self interest, even though we all do it,

1:53:18.160 --> 1:53:20.600
 just more extent to the less,

1:53:20.600 --> 1:53:23.980
 we deem it as morally apparent.

1:53:23.980 --> 1:53:24.960
 It's bad.

1:53:24.960 --> 1:53:26.120
 It's wrong.

1:53:26.120 --> 1:53:28.180
 I mean, your mother probably taught you the same thing

1:53:28.180 --> 1:53:29.220
 my mother taught me.

1:53:29.220 --> 1:53:30.960
 Think of others first.

1:53:30.960 --> 1:53:32.740
 Think of yourself last.

1:53:32.740 --> 1:53:35.680
 The good stuff is kept for the guests.

1:53:35.680 --> 1:53:38.340
 You never get to use the good stuff.

1:53:38.340 --> 1:53:39.700
 It's others.

1:53:39.700 --> 1:53:41.560
 That's what the focus of morality is.

1:53:41.560 --> 1:53:44.940
 Now, no mother, even no Jewish mother

1:53:44.940 --> 1:53:46.920
 actually believes that, right?

1:53:46.920 --> 1:53:50.640
 Because they don't really want you to be last.

1:53:50.640 --> 1:53:53.480
 They want you to be first and they push you to be first.

1:53:53.480 --> 1:53:56.400
 But morally, they've been taught their entire lives

1:53:56.400 --> 1:53:59.800
 and they believe that the right thing to say

1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:01.240
 and to some extent do

1:54:01.240 --> 1:54:06.240
 is to argue for sacrifice for other people, right?

1:54:06.840 --> 1:54:11.020
 So most people, 99% of people are torn.

1:54:12.420 --> 1:54:17.420
 They know they should be selfless,

1:54:17.920 --> 1:54:20.000
 sacrifice, live for other people.

1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:21.920
 They don't really want to.

1:54:21.920 --> 1:54:25.020
 So they act selfishly in their day to day life

1:54:25.020 --> 1:54:28.460
 and they feel guilty and they can't be happy.

1:54:28.460 --> 1:54:29.300
 They can't be happy.

1:54:29.300 --> 1:54:31.480
 And Jewish mothers and Catholic mothers are excellent

1:54:31.480 --> 1:54:33.920
 at using that guilt to manipulate you.

1:54:33.920 --> 1:54:35.120
 But the guilt is inevitable

1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:38.360
 because you've got these two conflicting things,

1:54:38.360 --> 1:54:39.360
 the way you want to live

1:54:39.360 --> 1:54:42.020
 and the way you've been taught to live.

1:54:42.020 --> 1:54:45.500
 And what objectivism does is that at the end of the day

1:54:45.500 --> 1:54:49.180
 provides you with a way to unite morality,

1:54:49.180 --> 1:54:52.720
 a proper morality with what you want

1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:55.080
 and to think about what you really want,

1:54:55.080 --> 1:54:58.160
 to conceptualize what you really want properly.

1:54:58.160 --> 1:55:00.080
 So what you want is really good for you

1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:03.360
 and what you want will really lead to your happiness.

1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:06.760
 So, you know, we reject the idea of sacrifice.

1:55:06.760 --> 1:55:08.480
 We reject the idea of living for other people,

1:55:08.480 --> 1:55:13.480
 but you see, if you believe that the purpose of morality

1:55:14.120 --> 1:55:16.080
 is to sacrifice for other people

1:55:17.220 --> 1:55:18.760
 and you look at Jeff Bezos,

1:55:19.760 --> 1:55:22.120
 when was the last time he sacrificed anything, right?

1:55:22.120 --> 1:55:23.520
 He was living pretty well.

1:55:23.520 --> 1:55:26.220
 He's got billions that he could give it all away

1:55:26.220 --> 1:55:27.680
 and yet he doesn't.

1:55:27.680 --> 1:55:28.800
 How dare he?

1:55:28.800 --> 1:55:32.940
 You know, in my talks, I often position,

1:55:34.180 --> 1:55:35.200
 and I'm gonna use Bill Gates,

1:55:35.200 --> 1:55:37.960
 sorry guys, drop the conspiracy theory.

1:55:37.960 --> 1:55:41.320
 They're all BS, complete and utter nonsense.

1:55:41.320 --> 1:55:42.920
 There's not a shred of truth.

1:55:42.920 --> 1:55:45.480
 You know, I disagree with Bill Gates

1:55:45.480 --> 1:55:47.420
 on everything political.

1:55:47.420 --> 1:55:50.980
 I think he politically is a complete ignoramus,

1:55:50.980 --> 1:55:54.160
 but the guy's a genius when it comes to technology

1:55:54.160 --> 1:55:57.960
 and he's just thoughtful even in this philanthropy.

1:55:57.960 --> 1:56:00.300
 He just uses his mind and I respect that

1:56:00.300 --> 1:56:01.680
 even though politically he's terrible.

1:56:01.680 --> 1:56:04.000
 Anyway, think about this.

1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.880
 Who had a bigger impact on the lives

1:56:06.880 --> 1:56:08.520
 of poor people in the world?

1:56:08.520 --> 1:56:10.380
 Bill Gates or Mother Teresa?

1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:12.600
 Bill Gates.

1:56:12.600 --> 1:56:13.440
 It's not even close.

1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:17.400
 And Mother Teresa lived this altruistic life to the core.

1:56:17.400 --> 1:56:19.200
 She lived it consistently.

1:56:19.200 --> 1:56:21.680
 And yet she was miserable, pathetic, horrible.

1:56:21.680 --> 1:56:22.940
 She hated her life.

1:56:22.940 --> 1:56:25.200
 She was miserable.

1:56:25.200 --> 1:56:27.480
 And most of the people she helped didn't do very well

1:56:27.480 --> 1:56:30.760
 because she just helped them not die, right?

1:56:30.760 --> 1:56:32.800
 And then Bill Gates changed the world

1:56:32.800 --> 1:56:35.080
 and he helped a lot by providing technology.

1:56:35.080 --> 1:56:37.160
 We even, philanthropy gets to them.

1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:39.560
 The food gets them, much fancier, more efficient.

1:56:39.560 --> 1:56:40.960
 Yet who is the moral saint?

1:56:42.240 --> 1:56:44.640
 Sainthood is not determined based on

1:56:44.640 --> 1:56:46.120
 what you do for other people.

1:56:46.120 --> 1:56:49.100
 Sainthood is based on how much pain you suffer.

1:56:50.180 --> 1:56:52.080
 I like to ask people to go to a museum

1:56:52.080 --> 1:56:54.640
 and look at all the paintings of saints.

1:56:54.640 --> 1:56:57.420
 How many of them are smiling and are happy?

1:56:57.420 --> 1:56:59.260
 They've usually got arrows through them

1:56:59.260 --> 1:57:00.760
 and holes in their body

1:57:00.760 --> 1:57:02.720
 and they're just suffering a horrible death.

1:57:02.720 --> 1:57:05.160
 The whole point of the morality we are taught

1:57:06.360 --> 1:57:10.120
 is that happiness is immorality,

1:57:11.800 --> 1:57:15.200
 that happy people cannot be good people,

1:57:15.200 --> 1:57:17.280
 and that good people suffer

1:57:17.280 --> 1:57:20.760
 and that suffering is necessary for morality.

1:57:20.760 --> 1:57:25.040
 Morality is about self sacrifice and suffering.

1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:28.400
 And at the end of the day,

1:57:28.400 --> 1:57:30.000
 almost all the problems in the world

1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:34.160
 boil down to that false view.

1:57:34.160 --> 1:57:37.580
 So can we try to talk about,

1:57:37.580 --> 1:57:39.840
 part of it is the problem of the word selfishness,

1:57:39.840 --> 1:57:42.920
 but let's talk about the virtue of selfishness.

1:57:42.920 --> 1:57:45.160
 So let's start at the fact that for me,

1:57:45.160 --> 1:57:48.120
 I really enjoy doing stuff for other people.

1:57:48.120 --> 1:57:53.120
 I enjoy cheering on the success of others.

1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:55.400
 Why?

1:57:55.400 --> 1:57:56.440
 I don't know.

1:57:56.440 --> 1:57:57.280
 It's deep in that.

1:57:57.280 --> 1:57:58.100
 Well, think about it.

1:57:58.100 --> 1:57:59.240
 Why?

1:57:59.240 --> 1:58:01.400
 Because I think you do know.

1:58:01.400 --> 1:58:03.600
 If I were to really think,

1:58:05.800 --> 1:58:08.640
 I don't want to resort to like evolutionary arguments

1:58:08.640 --> 1:58:10.360
 or like this is somehow different.

1:58:10.360 --> 1:58:13.040
 So I think.

1:58:14.040 --> 1:58:16.960
 So I can tell you why I enjoy helping others.

1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:18.200
 Maybe you can go there.

1:58:18.200 --> 1:58:19.120
 Like one thing,

1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:21.120
 cause we should talk about love a little bit.

1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:23.000
 I'll tell you there's a part of me

1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:26.640
 that's a little bit not rational.

1:58:26.640 --> 1:58:29.600
 Like there's a gut that I follow

1:58:29.600 --> 1:58:32.520
 that not everything I do is perfectly rational.

1:58:32.520 --> 1:58:36.600
 For example, my dad criticizes me.

1:58:36.600 --> 1:58:38.680
 He says like, you should always have a plan.

1:58:38.680 --> 1:58:40.040
 Like it should make sense.

1:58:40.040 --> 1:58:41.360
 You have a strategy.

1:58:41.360 --> 1:58:44.120
 And I say that,

1:58:44.120 --> 1:58:46.680
 I left, I stepped down from my full salary position

1:58:46.680 --> 1:58:47.840
 at MIT.

1:58:47.840 --> 1:58:50.160
 There's so many things I did without like a plan.

1:58:50.160 --> 1:58:51.040
 It's a gut.

1:58:51.040 --> 1:58:53.640
 It's like, I want to start a company.

1:58:53.640 --> 1:58:55.320
 Well, you know how many companies fail?

1:58:55.320 --> 1:58:56.160
 I don't know.

1:58:56.160 --> 1:58:58.800
 It's a gut.

1:58:58.800 --> 1:59:02.600
 And the same thing with being kind to others is a gut.

1:59:02.600 --> 1:59:06.440
 I watched the way that karma works in this world

1:59:06.440 --> 1:59:07.840
 that the people like us,

1:59:07.840 --> 1:59:09.880
 one guy I look up to is Joe Rogan,

1:59:09.880 --> 1:59:12.200
 that he does stuff for others.

1:59:12.200 --> 1:59:15.360
 And that the joy he experiences,

1:59:15.360 --> 1:59:16.800
 the way he sees the world,

1:59:16.800 --> 1:59:20.760
 like just the glimmer in his eyes

1:59:20.760 --> 1:59:22.600
 because he does stuff for others

1:59:22.600 --> 1:59:24.200
 that creates a joyful experience.

1:59:24.200 --> 1:59:27.760
 And that somehow seems to be an instructive way to,

1:59:27.760 --> 1:59:31.520
 that to me is inspiring of a life well lived.

1:59:31.520 --> 1:59:32.960
 But you probably know a lot of people

1:59:32.960 --> 1:59:35.360
 who have done stuff for others who are not happy.

1:59:36.640 --> 1:59:37.960
 True.

1:59:37.960 --> 1:59:39.920
 So I don't think it's the doing stuff for others

1:59:39.920 --> 1:59:41.080
 that just brings the happiness.

1:59:41.080 --> 1:59:42.480
 It's why you do stuff for others

1:59:42.480 --> 1:59:44.120
 and what else you're doing in your life

1:59:44.120 --> 1:59:48.400
 and what is the proportion.

1:59:48.400 --> 1:59:51.240
 But it's why at the end of the day, which is,

1:59:51.240 --> 1:59:52.360
 and it's the same.

1:59:52.360 --> 1:59:55.240
 Look, you can maybe through a gut feeling say,

1:59:55.240 --> 1:59:56.680
 I wanna start a company,

1:59:56.680 --> 1:59:57.960
 but you better start doing thinking

1:59:57.960 --> 2:00:00.480
 about how and what and all of that.

2:00:00.480 --> 2:00:01.800
 And to some extent the why,

2:00:01.800 --> 2:00:03.760
 because if you really wanna be happy doing this,

2:00:03.760 --> 2:00:06.760
 you better make sure you're doing it for the right reason.

2:00:06.760 --> 2:00:08.280
 So I'm not, you know,

2:00:08.280 --> 2:00:10.280
 there's something called fast thinking,

2:00:10.280 --> 2:00:14.400
 Carlman, the Daniel Kahneman.

2:00:14.400 --> 2:00:15.640
 Daniel Kahneman talks about,

2:00:15.640 --> 2:00:19.560
 and there is, it's, you know,

2:00:19.560 --> 2:00:21.960
 all the integrations you've made so far in your life

2:00:21.960 --> 2:00:25.080
 cause you to have specialized knowledge and certain things

2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:27.080
 and you can think very fast

2:00:27.080 --> 2:00:31.440
 and your gut tells you what the right answer is.

2:00:31.440 --> 2:00:34.800
 But it's not, it's your mind is constantly evaluating

2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:35.960
 and constantly working.

2:00:37.560 --> 2:00:39.280
 You wanna make it as rational as you can,

2:00:39.280 --> 2:00:41.000
 not in the sense that I have to think through

2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:42.480
 every time I make a decision,

2:00:42.480 --> 2:00:45.880
 but that they've so programmed my mind in a sense

2:00:45.880 --> 2:00:48.880
 that the answers are the right answers,

2:00:48.880 --> 2:00:51.440
 you know, when I get them.

2:00:53.720 --> 2:00:58.720
 So, you know, I like, I view other people as a value.

2:01:00.640 --> 2:01:02.880
 Other people contribute enormously to my life,

2:01:04.200 --> 2:01:07.320
 whether it's a romantic love relationship

2:01:07.320 --> 2:01:09.400
 or whether it's a friendship relationship

2:01:09.400 --> 2:01:12.520
 or whether it's just, you know,

2:01:12.520 --> 2:01:14.960
 Jeff Bezos creating Amazon

2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:18.480
 and delivering goodies to my home when I get them.

2:01:18.480 --> 2:01:20.600
 And people do all that, right?

2:01:20.600 --> 2:01:22.120
 It's not just Jeff Bezos.

2:01:22.120 --> 2:01:23.040
 He gets the most credit,

2:01:23.040 --> 2:01:24.720
 but everybody in that chain of command,

2:01:24.720 --> 2:01:27.320
 everybody at Amazon is working for me.

2:01:27.320 --> 2:01:28.520
 I love that.

2:01:28.520 --> 2:01:31.520
 I love the idea of a human being.

2:01:31.520 --> 2:01:34.520
 I love the idea that there are people capable

2:01:34.520 --> 2:01:37.600
 of being an Einstein, of being, you know,

2:01:37.600 --> 2:01:40.400
 and creating and building and making stuff

2:01:40.400 --> 2:01:42.400
 that makes my life so good.

2:01:42.400 --> 2:01:45.480
 You know, most of us like,

2:01:45.480 --> 2:01:47.440
 this is not a good room for an example.

2:01:47.440 --> 2:01:50.000
 Most of us like plants, right?

2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:51.400
 We like pets.

2:01:51.400 --> 2:01:53.240
 I don't particularly, but people like pets.

2:01:53.240 --> 2:01:54.080
 Why?

2:01:54.080 --> 2:01:55.720
 We like to see life.

2:01:57.120 --> 2:01:59.800
 Human beings are life on steroids, right?

2:01:59.800 --> 2:02:01.040
 They're life with a brain.

2:02:01.040 --> 2:02:03.560
 It's amazing, right, what they can do.

2:02:03.560 --> 2:02:05.240
 I love people.

2:02:05.240 --> 2:02:07.160
 Now that doesn't mean I love everybody

2:02:07.160 --> 2:02:08.040
 because there's some,

2:02:08.040 --> 2:02:10.680
 there are really bad people out there who I hate, right?

2:02:10.680 --> 2:02:11.960
 And I do hate.

2:02:11.960 --> 2:02:14.120
 And there are people out there that are just,

2:02:14.120 --> 2:02:15.520
 I have no opinion about.

2:02:15.520 --> 2:02:18.680
 But generally the idea of a human being

2:02:18.680 --> 2:02:20.000
 to me is a phenomenal idea.

2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:22.600
 When I see a baby, I light up

2:02:22.600 --> 2:02:26.040
 because to me there's a potential, you know,

2:02:26.920 --> 2:02:29.600
 there's this magnificent potential

2:02:29.600 --> 2:02:31.080
 that is embodied in that.

2:02:31.080 --> 2:02:34.080
 And when I see people struggling and need help,

2:02:34.080 --> 2:02:36.600
 I think they're human beings.

2:02:36.600 --> 2:02:38.600
 You know, they embody that potential.

2:02:38.600 --> 2:02:40.760
 They embody that goodness.

2:02:40.760 --> 2:02:43.200
 They might turn out to be bad,

2:02:43.200 --> 2:02:45.320
 but why would I ever give the presumption of that?

2:02:45.320 --> 2:02:46.920
 I give them the presumption of the positive

2:02:46.920 --> 2:02:48.840
 and I cheer them on.

2:02:48.840 --> 2:02:52.120
 And I enjoy watching people succeed.

2:02:52.120 --> 2:02:54.720
 I enjoy watching people get to the top of the mountain

2:02:54.720 --> 2:02:56.080
 and produce something.

2:02:56.080 --> 2:02:59.040
 Even if I don't get anything directly from it,

2:02:59.040 --> 2:03:03.320
 I enjoy that because it's part of my enjoyment of life.

2:03:03.320 --> 2:03:08.240
 So the word, to you, the morality of selfishness,

2:03:08.240 --> 2:03:10.320
 this kind of love of other human beings,

2:03:10.320 --> 2:03:13.840
 the love of life fits into a morality of selfishness.

2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:18.760
 Cannot, because there's no context

2:03:18.760 --> 2:03:21.880
 in which you can truly love yourself

2:03:21.880 --> 2:03:24.880
 without loving life and loving what it means to be human.

2:03:24.880 --> 2:03:28.880
 So, you know, the love of yourself is gonna manifest itself

2:03:28.880 --> 2:03:31.560
 definitely in different people, but it's core.

2:03:31.560 --> 2:03:33.360
 What do you love about yourself?

2:03:33.360 --> 2:03:35.880
 First of all, I love that I'm alive.

2:03:35.880 --> 2:03:39.600
 I love this world and the opportunities it provides me

2:03:39.600 --> 2:03:43.640
 and the fun and the excitement of discovering something new

2:03:43.640 --> 2:03:46.920
 and meeting a new person and having a conversation.

2:03:46.920 --> 2:03:51.200
 You know, all of this is immensely enjoyable,

2:03:51.200 --> 2:03:54.120
 but behind all of that is a particular human character.

2:03:54.120 --> 2:03:55.600
 There's a particular human capability

2:03:55.600 --> 2:03:57.880
 that not only I have, other people have.

2:03:57.880 --> 2:03:59.960
 And the fact that they have it makes my life

2:03:59.960 --> 2:04:03.680
 so much more fun because, so it's,

2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:07.360
 you cannot view, you know, it's all integrated

2:04:07.360 --> 2:04:09.320
 and you cannot view yourself in isolation.

2:04:09.320 --> 2:04:13.240
 Now that doesn't place a moral commandment on me,

2:04:14.680 --> 2:04:16.520
 help everybody who's poor

2:04:16.520 --> 2:04:18.600
 that you happen to meet in the street.

2:04:18.600 --> 2:04:21.560
 It doesn't place a burden on me in a sense

2:04:21.560 --> 2:04:25.640
 that now I have this moral duty to help everybody.

2:04:25.640 --> 2:04:27.800
 It leaves me free to make decisions

2:04:27.800 --> 2:04:28.920
 about who I help and who I don't.

2:04:28.920 --> 2:04:31.560
 There's some people who I will not help.

2:04:31.560 --> 2:04:35.520
 There's some people who I do not wish positive things upon.

2:04:36.680 --> 2:04:39.480
 Bad people should have bad outcomes.

2:04:39.480 --> 2:04:41.800
 Bad people should suffer.

2:04:41.800 --> 2:04:42.640
 So.

2:04:42.640 --> 2:04:44.720
 And then you have the freedom to choose who's good,

2:04:44.720 --> 2:04:45.560
 who's bad within your.

2:04:45.560 --> 2:04:47.720
 It's your decision based on your values.

2:04:47.720 --> 2:04:49.760
 Now, I think there's an objectivity to it.

2:04:49.760 --> 2:04:52.080
 There's a standard by which you should evaluate

2:04:52.080 --> 2:04:53.080
 good versus bad.

2:04:53.080 --> 2:04:55.000
 And that standard should be to what extent

2:04:55.000 --> 2:04:57.560
 do they contribute or hurt human life?

2:04:57.560 --> 2:04:59.600
 The standard is human life.

2:04:59.600 --> 2:05:01.560
 And so when I say, look at Jeff Bezos,

2:05:01.560 --> 2:05:04.200
 I say, he's contributed to human life, good guy.

2:05:04.200 --> 2:05:05.840
 I might disagree with him on stuff.

2:05:05.840 --> 2:05:07.240
 We might disagree about politics.

2:05:07.240 --> 2:05:08.920
 We might disagree about women.

2:05:08.920 --> 2:05:10.280
 I don't know what we agree.

2:05:10.280 --> 2:05:15.280
 But overall, big picture, he is pro life, right?

2:05:15.320 --> 2:05:19.440
 I look at somebody like, you know, to take like 99.9%

2:05:19.440 --> 2:05:22.800
 of our politicians and they are pro death.

2:05:23.880 --> 2:05:25.520
 They're pro destruction.

2:05:25.520 --> 2:05:29.320
 They're pro cutting corners in ways that destroy human life

2:05:29.320 --> 2:05:31.160
 and human potential and human ability.

2:05:31.160 --> 2:05:34.240
 So I literally hate almost every politician out there.

2:05:35.440 --> 2:05:38.000
 And I wish ill on them, right?

2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:40.120
 I don't want them to be successful or happy.

2:05:40.120 --> 2:05:42.200
 I want them all to go away, right?

2:05:42.200 --> 2:05:43.040
 Leave me alone.

2:05:43.040 --> 2:05:45.200
 So I believe in justice.

2:05:45.200 --> 2:05:46.760
 I believe good things should happen to good people

2:05:46.760 --> 2:05:47.920
 and bad things should happen to bad people.

2:05:47.920 --> 2:05:52.560
 So I make those generalizations based on this one,

2:05:52.560 --> 2:05:54.080
 you know, on the other hand, if, you know,

2:05:54.080 --> 2:05:55.680
 I shouldn't say all politicians, right?

2:05:55.680 --> 2:05:57.520
 So if I, you know, I love Thomas Jefferson

2:05:57.520 --> 2:05:59.360
 and George Washington, right?

2:05:59.360 --> 2:06:00.520
 I love Abraham Lincoln.

2:06:00.520 --> 2:06:02.680
 I love people who fought for freedom

2:06:02.680 --> 2:06:04.720
 and who believed in freedom, who had these ideas

2:06:04.720 --> 2:06:07.520
 and lived up to, at least in parts of their lives,

2:06:07.520 --> 2:06:08.360
 to those principles.

2:06:08.360 --> 2:06:10.360
 Now, do I think Thomas Jefferson was flawed

2:06:10.360 --> 2:06:11.280
 because he held slaves?

2:06:11.280 --> 2:06:12.880
 Absolutely.

2:06:12.880 --> 2:06:15.520
 But the virtues way outweigh that in my view.

2:06:15.520 --> 2:06:17.560
 And I understand people who don't accept that.

2:06:17.560 --> 2:06:19.280
 You don't have to also love

2:06:19.280 --> 2:06:21.080
 and hate the entirety of the person.

2:06:21.080 --> 2:06:23.360
 There's parts of that person that you're attracted to.

2:06:23.360 --> 2:06:26.520
 The major part is pro life and therefore I'm pro that person.

2:06:26.520 --> 2:06:28.520
 And I think, and I said earlier

2:06:28.520 --> 2:06:30.040
 that objectivism is a philosophy of love.

2:06:30.040 --> 2:06:35.040
 And I believe that because objectivism is about your life,

2:06:35.440 --> 2:06:38.240
 about loving your life, about embracing your life,

2:06:38.240 --> 2:06:39.960
 about engaging with the world,

2:06:39.960 --> 2:06:42.600
 about loving the world in which you live,

2:06:42.600 --> 2:06:44.800
 about win win relationships with other people,

2:06:44.800 --> 2:06:48.280
 which means to a large extent loving the good

2:06:48.280 --> 2:06:50.720
 in other people and the best in other people

2:06:50.720 --> 2:06:52.280
 and encouraging that and supporting that

2:06:52.280 --> 2:06:53.440
 and promoting that.

2:06:53.440 --> 2:06:56.440
 So I know selfishness is a harsh word

2:06:56.440 --> 2:06:58.960
 because the culture has given it that harshness.

2:06:58.960 --> 2:07:00.320
 Selfishness is a harsh word

2:07:00.320 --> 2:07:01.920
 because the people who don't like selfishness

2:07:01.920 --> 2:07:04.240
 want you to believe it's a harsh word.

2:07:04.240 --> 2:07:05.640
 But it's not.

2:07:05.640 --> 2:07:06.560
 What does it mean?

2:07:06.560 --> 2:07:09.000
 It means focus on self.

2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:10.840
 It means take care of self.

2:07:10.840 --> 2:07:13.360
 It means make yourself your highest priority,

2:07:13.360 --> 2:07:14.880
 not your only priority,

2:07:14.880 --> 2:07:16.720
 because in taking care of self,

2:07:16.720 --> 2:07:20.320
 what would I be without my wife?

2:07:20.320 --> 2:07:24.440
 What would I be without the people who support me,

2:07:24.440 --> 2:07:28.520
 who help me, who I have these love relationships with?

2:07:30.280 --> 2:07:31.880
 So other people are crucial.

2:07:31.880 --> 2:07:36.880
 What would my life be without Steve Jobs, right?

2:07:36.920 --> 2:07:41.360
 A lot of things you mentioned here are just beautiful.

2:07:41.360 --> 2:07:42.840
 So one is win win.

2:07:42.840 --> 2:07:45.800
 So one key thing about this selfishness

2:07:45.800 --> 2:07:48.720
 and the idea of objectivism is the philosophy of love

2:07:48.720 --> 2:07:52.240
 is that you don't want parasitism.

2:07:52.240 --> 2:07:54.400
 So that is unethical.

2:07:54.400 --> 2:07:58.320
 So you actually, first of all, you say win win a lot.

2:07:58.320 --> 2:08:00.240
 And I just like that terminology

2:08:00.240 --> 2:08:02.280
 because it's a good way to see life.

2:08:02.280 --> 2:08:06.560
 It's tried to maximize the number of win win interactions.

2:08:06.560 --> 2:08:08.320
 That's a good way to see business actually.

2:08:08.320 --> 2:08:10.920
 Well, life generally, I think every aspect of life,

2:08:10.920 --> 2:08:13.800
 you wanna have a win win relationship with your wife.

2:08:13.800 --> 2:08:16.000
 Imagine if it was win lose.

2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:18.200
 Either way, if you win and she loses,

2:08:18.200 --> 2:08:20.440
 how long is that gonna sustain?

2:08:20.440 --> 2:08:25.200
 So win lose relationships are not in equilibrium.

2:08:25.200 --> 2:08:27.080
 What they turn into is lose lose.

2:08:27.080 --> 2:08:29.800
 Like win lose turns into lose lose.

2:08:29.800 --> 2:08:34.280
 And so the only alternative to lose lose is win win.

2:08:34.280 --> 2:08:36.880
 And you win and the person you love wins.

2:08:36.880 --> 2:08:38.440
 What's better than that, right?

2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:42.480
 That's the way to maximize, so like the selfishness

2:08:42.480 --> 2:08:44.480
 is you're trying to maximize the win,

2:08:44.480 --> 2:08:48.200
 but the way to maximize the win is to maximize the win win.

2:08:48.200 --> 2:08:49.600
 Yes, and it turns out,

2:08:49.600 --> 2:08:51.800
 and Adam Smith understood this a long time ago,

2:08:51.800 --> 2:08:54.080
 that if you focus on your own winning

2:08:55.360 --> 2:08:57.960
 while respecting other people as human beings,

2:08:57.960 --> 2:08:59.120
 then everybody wins.

2:08:59.120 --> 2:09:00.240
 And the beauty of capitalism,

2:09:00.240 --> 2:09:02.200
 if we go back to capitalism for a second,

2:09:02.200 --> 2:09:05.080
 the beauty of capitalism is you cannot be successful

2:09:05.080 --> 2:09:08.800
 in capitalism without producing values

2:09:08.800 --> 2:09:10.240
 that other people appreciate

2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:12.120
 and therefore willing to buy from you.

2:09:12.120 --> 2:09:14.960
 And they buy them, and this goes back to that question

2:09:14.960 --> 2:09:16.520
 about the engineer and Steve Jobs.

2:09:16.520 --> 2:09:18.960
 Why is the engineer working there?

2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:22.560
 Because he's getting paid more than his time is worth to him.

2:09:22.560 --> 2:09:24.280
 I know people don't like to think in those terms,

2:09:24.280 --> 2:09:25.720
 but that's the reality.

2:09:25.720 --> 2:09:27.960
 If his time is worth more to him than what he's getting paid,

2:09:27.960 --> 2:09:28.800
 he would leave.

2:09:29.880 --> 2:09:30.840
 So he's winning.

2:09:32.160 --> 2:09:33.120
 And is Apple winning?

2:09:33.120 --> 2:09:35.280
 Yes, because they're getting more productivity from him.

2:09:35.280 --> 2:09:36.600
 They're getting more from him

2:09:36.600 --> 2:09:39.800
 than what he's actually producing.

2:09:40.920 --> 2:09:44.120
 It's tough because there's the human psychology

2:09:44.120 --> 2:09:45.720
 and imperfect information.

2:09:45.720 --> 2:09:47.840
 It just makes it a little messier

2:09:47.840 --> 2:09:50.360
 than the clarity of thinking you have about this.

2:09:50.360 --> 2:09:54.240
 It's just, you know, because for sure,

2:09:54.240 --> 2:09:56.920
 but not everything in life is an economic transaction.

2:09:56.920 --> 2:10:00.520
 It ultimately is close, but it...

2:10:00.520 --> 2:10:02.240
 Even if it's not an economic transaction,

2:10:02.240 --> 2:10:05.560
 even if it's a relationship transaction,

2:10:05.560 --> 2:10:08.640
 when you get to a point with a friend

2:10:08.640 --> 2:10:11.400
 where you're not gaining from the relationship,

2:10:11.400 --> 2:10:12.560
 friendship's gonna be over.

2:10:12.560 --> 2:10:14.720
 Not immediately, because it takes time for these things

2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:17.200
 to manifest itself and to really absorb and to...

2:10:17.200 --> 2:10:20.200
 But we change friendships, we change our loves, right?

2:10:20.200 --> 2:10:22.000
 We fall in and out of love.

2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:23.920
 We fall out of love because we're not...

2:10:23.920 --> 2:10:27.000
 Love, so let's go back to love, right?

2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:29.160
 Love is the most selfish of all emotions.

2:10:29.160 --> 2:10:31.920
 Love is about what you do to me, right?

2:10:31.920 --> 2:10:34.360
 So I love my wife because she makes me feel better

2:10:34.360 --> 2:10:35.200
 about myself.

2:10:36.520 --> 2:10:40.520
 So, you know, the idea of selfless love is bizarre.

2:10:41.560 --> 2:10:44.960
 So Ayn Rand used to say, before you say, I love you,

2:10:44.960 --> 2:10:46.280
 you have to say the I.

2:10:48.400 --> 2:10:50.480
 And you have to know who you are

2:10:50.480 --> 2:10:52.080
 and you have to appreciate yourself.

2:10:52.080 --> 2:10:53.520
 If you hate yourself,

2:10:53.520 --> 2:10:55.520
 what does it mean to love somebody else?

2:10:55.520 --> 2:10:58.560
 So I love my wife because she makes me feel great

2:10:58.560 --> 2:10:59.400
 about the world.

2:11:00.400 --> 2:11:02.520
 And she loves me for the same reason.

2:11:02.520 --> 2:11:05.640
 And so Ayn Rand used to use this example.

2:11:05.640 --> 2:11:10.360
 Imagine you go up to be spoused the night before the wedding

2:11:10.360 --> 2:11:14.680
 and you say, you know, I get nothing out of this relationship.

2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:18.680
 I'm doing this purely as an act of noble self sacrifice.

2:11:18.680 --> 2:11:23.120
 She would slap you, as she should, right?

2:11:23.120 --> 2:11:27.760
 So, you know, we know this intuitively that love is selfish,

2:11:27.760 --> 2:11:29.800
 but we are afraid to admit it to ourselves.

2:11:29.800 --> 2:11:30.640
 And why?

2:11:30.640 --> 2:11:33.000
 Because the other side has convinced us

2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:36.520
 that selfishness is associated with exploiting other people.

2:11:36.520 --> 2:11:39.240
 Selfishness means lying, cheating, stealing,

2:11:39.240 --> 2:11:42.160
 walking on corpses, backstabbing people.

2:11:43.360 --> 2:11:47.800
 But is that ever in your self interest truly, right?

2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:50.240
 You know, I'll often be in front of an audience to say,

2:11:50.240 --> 2:11:52.320
 okay, how many people have you ever been in a relationship

2:11:52.320 --> 2:11:54.600
 and say, okay, how many people here have lied?

2:11:54.600 --> 2:11:57.040
 I'm kidding, right?

2:11:57.040 --> 2:12:00.840
 How many of you think that if you did that consistently,

2:12:00.840 --> 2:12:02.480
 that would make your life better?

2:12:03.360 --> 2:12:04.960
 Nobody thinks that, right?

2:12:04.960 --> 2:12:09.800
 Because everybody's experienced how shitty lying,

2:12:09.800 --> 2:12:11.360
 not because of how it makes you feel

2:12:11.360 --> 2:12:12.480
 out of a sense of guilt.

2:12:12.480 --> 2:12:15.320
 Existentially, it's just a bad strategy, right?

2:12:15.320 --> 2:12:18.200
 You get caught, you have to create other lies

2:12:18.200 --> 2:12:19.920
 to cover up the previous lie.

2:12:19.920 --> 2:12:23.800
 It screws up with your own psychology and your own cognition.

2:12:23.800 --> 2:12:27.880
 You know, the mind, to some extent, like a computer, right,

2:12:27.880 --> 2:12:29.680
 is an integrating machine.

2:12:29.680 --> 2:12:31.120
 And in computer science, I understand

2:12:31.120 --> 2:12:33.720
 there's a term called garbage in, garbage out.

2:12:33.720 --> 2:12:35.000
 Lying is garbage in.

2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:36.000
 Yeah.

2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:38.920
 So it's not good strategy.

2:12:38.920 --> 2:12:42.760
 Cheating, screwing your customers in a business,

2:12:42.760 --> 2:12:45.120
 not paying your suppliers as a businessman,

2:12:45.120 --> 2:12:47.080
 not good business practices,

2:12:47.080 --> 2:12:49.320
 not good practices for being alive.

2:12:49.320 --> 2:12:52.960
 So win, win is both model and practical.

2:12:52.960 --> 2:12:55.040
 And the beauty of Heinemann's philosophy,

2:12:55.040 --> 2:12:57.240
 and I think this is really important,

2:12:57.240 --> 2:12:58.760
 is that the model is the practical

2:12:58.760 --> 2:13:00.320
 and the practical is the model.

2:13:00.320 --> 2:13:03.280
 And therefore, if you are a model, you will be happy.

2:13:04.680 --> 2:13:08.040
 Yeah, that's why the application

2:13:08.040 --> 2:13:11.840
 of the philosophy of objectivism is so easy to practice.

2:13:11.840 --> 2:13:15.160
 So like, or to discuss, or possible to discuss.

2:13:15.160 --> 2:13:16.480
 That's why you talk about all.

2:13:16.480 --> 2:13:17.560
 I'm so clear cut.

2:13:17.560 --> 2:13:18.400
 Yeah.

2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:19.400
 I'm so vigorous about my view.

2:13:19.400 --> 2:13:20.920
 And that's fundamentally practical.

2:13:20.920 --> 2:13:24.440
 I mean, that's the best of philosophies is practical.

2:13:24.440 --> 2:13:27.680
 It's in a sense, teaching you how to live a good life.

2:13:27.680 --> 2:13:30.160
 And it's teaching you how to live a good life,

2:13:30.160 --> 2:13:33.280
 not just as you, but as a human being.

2:13:33.280 --> 2:13:35.440
 And therefore, the principles that apply to you

2:13:35.440 --> 2:13:37.200
 probably apply to me as well.

2:13:37.200 --> 2:13:40.040
 And if we both share the same principles

2:13:40.040 --> 2:13:42.760
 of how to live a good life, we're not gonna be enemies.

2:13:44.480 --> 2:13:46.840
 You brought up anarchy earlier.

2:13:46.840 --> 2:13:49.560
 It's an interesting question

2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:52.040
 because you've kind of said politicians.

2:13:52.040 --> 2:13:54.000
 I mean, part of it is a little bit joking,

2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:57.320
 but politicians are not good people.

2:13:57.320 --> 2:13:58.440
 Yep.

2:13:58.440 --> 2:14:02.080
 So, but we should have some.

2:14:02.080 --> 2:14:05.840
 So you have an opposition to anarchism.

2:14:05.840 --> 2:14:08.360
 So they, first of all, they weren't always not bad people.

2:14:08.360 --> 2:14:10.800
 That is, I gave examples of people

2:14:10.800 --> 2:14:11.880
 who engage in political life

2:14:11.880 --> 2:14:14.080
 who I think were good people basically.

2:14:14.080 --> 2:14:17.160
 And, but they think they get worse over time

2:14:17.160 --> 2:14:19.960
 if the system is corrupt.

2:14:19.960 --> 2:14:21.920
 And I think the system, unfortunately,

2:14:21.920 --> 2:14:24.560
 even the American system, as good as it was,

2:14:24.560 --> 2:14:27.400
 was founded on quicksand and have corruption built in.

2:14:28.560 --> 2:14:30.400
 They didn't quite get it.

2:14:30.400 --> 2:14:31.920
 And they needed Ayn Rand to get it.

2:14:31.920 --> 2:14:32.920
 So I'm not blaming them.

2:14:32.920 --> 2:14:34.440
 I don't think they share any blame.

2:14:34.440 --> 2:14:39.280
 You needed a philosophy in order to completely fulfill

2:14:39.280 --> 2:14:40.800
 the promise that is America,

2:14:40.800 --> 2:14:42.280
 or the promise that is the founding of America.

2:14:42.280 --> 2:14:45.320
 So the place where corruption sneaked in

2:14:45.320 --> 2:14:48.400
 is the lack in some way of the philosophy

2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:49.600
 underlying the nation?

2:14:49.600 --> 2:14:50.440
 Absolutely.

2:14:50.440 --> 2:14:53.080
 So it's Christianity.

2:14:53.080 --> 2:14:57.120
 It's, you know, not to hit on another controversial topic.

2:14:57.120 --> 2:15:01.800
 It's religion, which undercut their morality.

2:15:01.800 --> 2:15:05.880
 So the founders were explicitly Christian

2:15:05.880 --> 2:15:08.240
 and altruistic in their morality.

2:15:09.960 --> 2:15:11.800
 Implicitly, in terms of their actions,

2:15:11.800 --> 2:15:12.880
 they were completely secular,

2:15:12.880 --> 2:15:15.240
 and they were very secular anyway.

2:15:15.240 --> 2:15:17.680
 But in their morality, even, they were secular.

2:15:17.680 --> 2:15:20.000
 So there's nothing in Christianity that says

2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:23.200
 that you have an inalienable right to pursue happiness.

2:15:23.200 --> 2:15:25.120
 That's unbelievably self interested

2:15:25.120 --> 2:15:28.400
 and based on kind of a moral philosophy of ego,

2:15:28.400 --> 2:15:30.080
 of an egoistic moral philosophy.

2:15:30.080 --> 2:15:31.120
 But they didn't know that.

2:15:31.120 --> 2:15:33.080
 And they didn't know how to ground it.

2:15:33.080 --> 2:15:36.040
 They implicitly, they had that fast thinking, that gut.

2:15:36.040 --> 2:15:37.520
 They told them that this was right.

2:15:37.520 --> 2:15:39.640
 And the whole enlightenment, that period,

2:15:39.640 --> 2:15:44.640
 from John Locke on to really to Hume,

2:15:44.880 --> 2:15:47.280
 that period is about pursuit of happiness,

2:15:47.280 --> 2:15:50.280
 using reason in pursuit of the good life, right?

2:15:50.280 --> 2:15:51.480
 But they can't ground it.

2:15:51.480 --> 2:15:53.240
 They don't really understand what reason is,

2:15:53.240 --> 2:15:56.840
 and they don't really understand what happiness requires.

2:15:56.840 --> 2:16:00.040
 And they can't detach themselves from Christianity.

2:16:00.040 --> 2:16:01.400
 They're not allowed to politically.

2:16:01.400 --> 2:16:02.720
 And I think conceptually,

2:16:02.720 --> 2:16:05.080
 you just can't make that big break.

2:16:05.080 --> 2:16:07.160
 Rand is an enlightenment thinker in that sense.

2:16:07.160 --> 2:16:10.960
 She is what should have followed right after, right?

2:16:10.960 --> 2:16:13.320
 She should have come there and grounded them

2:16:13.320 --> 2:16:18.080
 in the secular and in the egoistic

2:16:18.080 --> 2:16:19.960
 and the Aristotelian view of morality

2:16:19.960 --> 2:16:24.960
 as a code of values to basically to guide your life,

2:16:25.240 --> 2:16:27.240
 to guide your life towards happiness.

2:16:27.240 --> 2:16:28.800
 That's Aristotle's view, right?

2:16:31.200 --> 2:16:34.000
 So they didn't have that.

2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:38.400
 So I think that government is necessary.

2:16:38.400 --> 2:16:39.520
 It's not a necessary evil.

2:16:39.520 --> 2:16:42.880
 It's a necessary good, because it does something good.

2:16:43.840 --> 2:16:45.800
 And the good that it does

2:16:45.800 --> 2:16:48.000
 is it eliminates coercion from society.

2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:50.000
 It eliminates violence from society.

2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:52.680
 It eliminates the use of force

2:16:52.680 --> 2:16:55.360
 between individuals from society.

2:16:55.360 --> 2:16:56.840
 And that...

2:16:56.840 --> 2:16:59.360
 But see, the argument like Michael Malice would make,

2:16:59.360 --> 2:17:02.440
 give me a chance here,

2:17:02.440 --> 2:17:05.960
 is why can't you apply the same kind of reasoning

2:17:05.960 --> 2:17:08.760
 that you've effectively used for the rest

2:17:08.760 --> 2:17:12.160
 of mutually agreed upon institutions

2:17:12.160 --> 2:17:14.040
 that are driven by capitalism,

2:17:14.040 --> 2:17:17.240
 that we can't also hire forces

2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:19.240
 to protect us from the violence,

2:17:19.240 --> 2:17:21.560
 to ensure the stability of society

2:17:21.560 --> 2:17:23.280
 that protects us from the violence.

2:17:24.920 --> 2:17:28.440
 Why draw the line at this particular place, right?

2:17:28.440 --> 2:17:30.840
 Well, because there is no other place to draw a line,

2:17:30.840 --> 2:17:32.600
 and there is a line.

2:17:32.600 --> 2:17:35.160
 And by the way, we draw lines at other places, right?

2:17:36.280 --> 2:17:40.560
 We don't vote.

2:17:45.240 --> 2:17:48.040
 We don't determine truth and science based on competition.

2:17:49.200 --> 2:17:51.520
 Right, so that's a line.

2:17:51.520 --> 2:17:53.680
 But first of all, some people might say...

2:17:53.680 --> 2:17:55.360
 I mean, there's competition in a sense

2:17:55.360 --> 2:17:57.360
 that you have alternate theories,

2:17:57.360 --> 2:17:59.080
 but at the end of the day,

2:17:59.080 --> 2:18:01.720
 whether you decide that he's right or he's right

2:18:01.720 --> 2:18:04.680
 is not based on the market.

2:18:04.680 --> 2:18:09.400
 It's based on facts, on reality, on objective reality.

2:18:09.400 --> 2:18:11.440
 You have to...

2:18:11.440 --> 2:18:14.280
 And some people will never accept that this person is right

2:18:14.280 --> 2:18:17.000
 because they don't see the string.

2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:19.160
 So first of all, what they reject,

2:18:19.160 --> 2:18:20.480
 what most anarchists reject,

2:18:20.480 --> 2:18:23.600
 even if they don't admit it or recognize it,

2:18:23.600 --> 2:18:26.640
 is they reject objective reality.

2:18:26.640 --> 2:18:27.920
 In which sense?

2:18:27.920 --> 2:18:29.480
 So like, okay, I get it, right.

2:18:29.480 --> 2:18:30.960
 So there's a whole...

2:18:30.960 --> 2:18:34.240
 So the whole realm of law

2:18:36.600 --> 2:18:38.760
 is a scientific realm

2:18:39.880 --> 2:18:43.880
 to define, for example, the boundaries of private property.

2:18:45.400 --> 2:18:47.480
 It's not an issue of competition.

2:18:47.480 --> 2:18:50.480
 It's not an issue of,

2:18:50.480 --> 2:18:53.760
 I have one system and you have another system.

2:18:53.760 --> 2:18:55.800
 It's an issue of a big competition.

2:18:55.800 --> 2:18:57.880
 It's an issue of objective reality.

2:18:57.880 --> 2:19:00.840
 And now it's more difficult than science in a sense

2:19:00.840 --> 2:19:03.600
 because it's more difficult to prove

2:19:03.600 --> 2:19:05.520
 that my conception of property is correct

2:19:05.520 --> 2:19:07.680
 and you're correct.

2:19:07.680 --> 2:19:10.200
 But there is a correct one.

2:19:10.200 --> 2:19:12.280
 In reality, there's a correct vision.

2:19:12.280 --> 2:19:13.280
 It's more abstract.

2:19:14.480 --> 2:19:15.320
 But look,

2:19:16.560 --> 2:19:19.920
 somebody has to decide what property is.

2:19:19.920 --> 2:19:24.920
 So my property is defined by certain boundaries.

2:19:24.920 --> 2:19:27.160
 And I have a police force

2:19:27.160 --> 2:19:30.040
 and I have a judiciary system that backs my vision.

2:19:31.040 --> 2:19:33.040
 And you have a claim against my property.

2:19:33.960 --> 2:19:35.120
 You have a claim against my property.

2:19:35.120 --> 2:19:38.240
 And you have a police force and a judicial system

2:19:38.240 --> 2:19:39.360
 that backs your claim.

2:19:40.720 --> 2:19:41.800
 Who's right?

2:19:41.800 --> 2:19:45.160
 So our definitions of property are different?

2:19:45.160 --> 2:19:46.400
 Yes, our definitions of property

2:19:46.400 --> 2:19:48.960
 or our claim on the property is different.

2:19:48.960 --> 2:19:54.200
 So what if we just agree on the definition of property and...

2:19:54.200 --> 2:19:55.760
 But why should we agree, right?

2:19:55.760 --> 2:19:58.720
 Your judicial system is one definition of property.

2:19:58.720 --> 2:20:00.320
 My judicial system is not.

2:20:00.320 --> 2:20:02.920
 You think that there's no such thing

2:20:02.920 --> 2:20:05.240
 as intellectual property rights.

2:20:05.240 --> 2:20:07.360
 And your whole system believes that.

2:20:07.360 --> 2:20:09.600
 And my whole system believes there is such thing.

2:20:09.600 --> 2:20:12.160
 So you are duplicating my books

2:20:12.160 --> 2:20:14.280
 and handing them out to all your friends

2:20:14.280 --> 2:20:16.000
 and not paying me a royalty.

2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:16.840
 Yeah.

2:20:16.840 --> 2:20:19.640
 And I think that's wrong.

2:20:19.640 --> 2:20:23.960
 My judicial system and my police force think that's wrong.

2:20:23.960 --> 2:20:27.880
 And we're both living in the same geographic area, right?

2:20:27.880 --> 2:20:31.560
 So we have overlapping jurisdictions.

2:20:31.560 --> 2:20:34.600
 Now, the anarchist would say, well, we'll negotiate.

2:20:34.600 --> 2:20:35.760
 Why should we negotiate?

2:20:35.760 --> 2:20:37.440
 My system is actually right.

2:20:37.440 --> 2:20:39.280
 There is such a thing as intellectual property rights.

2:20:39.280 --> 2:20:40.560
 There's no negotiation here.

2:20:40.560 --> 2:20:41.560
 You're wrong.

2:20:41.560 --> 2:20:44.280
 And you should either pay a fine or go to jail.

2:20:44.280 --> 2:20:45.520
 Yeah, but why can't...

2:20:45.520 --> 2:20:48.480
 Because it's a community, there's multiple parties

2:20:48.480 --> 2:20:49.920
 and it's like a majority vote.

2:20:49.920 --> 2:20:52.640
 They'll hire different forces that says,

2:20:52.640 --> 2:20:54.760
 yeah, Yaron is onto something here

2:20:54.760 --> 2:20:57.080
 with the definition of property and we'll go with that.

2:20:57.080 --> 2:21:01.320
 So are anarchists pro democracy in the majority rule sense?

2:21:01.320 --> 2:21:02.160
 Well, I think so.

2:21:02.160 --> 2:21:07.160
 I think anarchy promotes like emergent democracy, right?

2:21:07.680 --> 2:21:08.520
 Like the...

2:21:08.520 --> 2:21:09.960
 No, it doesn't.

2:21:09.960 --> 2:21:11.240
 I'll tell you what it promotes.

2:21:11.240 --> 2:21:15.960
 It promotes emergent strife and civil war and violence,

2:21:15.960 --> 2:21:18.240
 constant uninterrupted violence.

2:21:18.240 --> 2:21:20.880
 Because the only way to settle the dispute between us,

2:21:20.880 --> 2:21:23.240
 since we both think that we are right

2:21:23.240 --> 2:21:26.920
 and we have guns behind us to protect that

2:21:26.920 --> 2:21:28.080
 and we have a legal system,

2:21:28.080 --> 2:21:30.160
 we have a whole theory of ideas,

2:21:30.160 --> 2:21:33.720
 is you're stealing my stuff.

2:21:33.720 --> 2:21:35.560
 How do I get it back?

2:21:35.560 --> 2:21:37.440
 I invade you, right?

2:21:37.440 --> 2:21:41.880
 I take over, and who's gonna win that battle?

2:21:41.880 --> 2:21:43.000
 The smartest guy?

2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:44.440
 Oh, the guy with the biggest guns.

2:21:44.440 --> 2:21:46.360
 See, but the anarchists would say

2:21:46.360 --> 2:21:48.280
 that they're using implied,

2:21:48.280 --> 2:21:51.680
 like the state uses implied force.

2:21:51.680 --> 2:21:53.000
 They're already doing violence.

2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:56.040
 Because they take the state as it is today

2:21:56.040 --> 2:21:58.760
 and they refuse to engage in the conversation

2:21:58.760 --> 2:22:01.200
 about what a state should and could look like

2:22:01.200 --> 2:22:04.080
 and how we can create mechanisms

2:22:04.080 --> 2:22:07.000
 to protect us from the state using those.

2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:10.320
 But look, my view of anarchy is very simple.

2:22:10.320 --> 2:22:12.440
 It's a ridiculous position.

2:22:12.440 --> 2:22:13.560
 It's infantile.

2:22:13.560 --> 2:22:14.960
 I mean, I really mean this, right?

2:22:14.960 --> 2:22:16.480
 And sorry to Michael,

2:22:16.480 --> 2:22:19.320
 but and all the other very, very smart,

2:22:19.320 --> 2:22:20.760
 very, very smart anarchists.

2:22:20.760 --> 2:22:22.280
 Because anarchists is never,

2:22:23.320 --> 2:22:25.680
 you won't find a dumb anarchist.

2:22:25.680 --> 2:22:26.520
 Right.

2:22:26.520 --> 2:22:28.800
 Because dumb people know it wouldn't work.

2:22:28.800 --> 2:22:31.680
 You have to have, it's absolutely true.

2:22:31.680 --> 2:22:35.800
 You have to have a certain IQ to be an anarchist.

2:22:35.800 --> 2:22:37.400
 That's true, they're all really intelligent.

2:22:37.400 --> 2:22:38.240
 All intelligence.

2:22:38.240 --> 2:22:42.640
 And the reason is that you have to create

2:22:42.640 --> 2:22:45.840
 such a mythology in your head.

2:22:45.840 --> 2:22:49.440
 You have to create so many rationalizations.

2:22:49.440 --> 2:22:52.640
 Any Joe in the street knows it doesn't work

2:22:52.640 --> 2:22:55.560
 because they can understand what happens

2:22:55.560 --> 2:22:59.240
 when two people who are armed are in the street

2:22:59.240 --> 2:23:01.960
 and have a dispute and there's no mechanism

2:23:01.960 --> 2:23:03.680
 to resolve that dispute.

2:23:03.680 --> 2:23:04.640
 Yeah.

2:23:04.640 --> 2:23:06.320
 That's objective.

2:23:06.320 --> 2:23:07.840
 And this is where it gets subjective.

2:23:07.840 --> 2:23:09.440
 That's objective.

2:23:09.440 --> 2:23:11.280
 The whole point of government is

2:23:12.200 --> 2:23:14.800
 that it is the objective authority

2:23:14.800 --> 2:23:18.840
 for determining the truth in one regard,

2:23:18.840 --> 2:23:20.320
 in regard to force.

2:23:21.560 --> 2:23:25.600
 Because the only alternative to determining it

2:23:25.600 --> 2:23:27.920
 when it comes to force is through force.

2:23:27.920 --> 2:23:31.120
 The only way to resolve disputes is through force

2:23:31.120 --> 2:23:33.160
 or through this negotiation, which is unjust

2:23:33.160 --> 2:23:34.760
 because if one party is right and one party is wrong,

2:23:34.760 --> 2:23:35.880
 why negotiate?

2:23:35.880 --> 2:23:38.600
 And this is the point.

2:23:38.600 --> 2:23:41.760
 I'm not against competition of governance.

2:23:41.760 --> 2:23:43.720
 I'm all for competition of governance.

2:23:43.720 --> 2:23:44.680
 We do that all the time.

2:23:44.680 --> 2:23:46.200
 It's called countries.

2:23:46.200 --> 2:23:49.120
 The United States has a certain governance structure.

2:23:49.120 --> 2:23:50.800
 The Soviet Union had a governance structure.

2:23:50.800 --> 2:23:52.760
 Mexico has a governance structure.

2:23:52.760 --> 2:23:54.160
 And they're competing.

2:23:54.160 --> 2:23:55.880
 And we can observe the competition.

2:23:55.880 --> 2:23:58.640
 And in my world, you could move freely

2:23:58.640 --> 2:24:00.240
 from one governance to another.

2:24:00.240 --> 2:24:01.520
 If you didn't like your governance,

2:24:01.520 --> 2:24:03.840
 you would move to a better governance system.

2:24:03.840 --> 2:24:07.240
 But they have to have autonomy within a geographic area.

2:24:07.240 --> 2:24:10.720
 Otherwise what you get is complete and utter civil war.

2:24:10.720 --> 2:24:13.120
 The law needs to be objective.

2:24:13.120 --> 2:24:15.360
 And there needs to be one law over a piece of ground.

2:24:15.360 --> 2:24:16.800
 And if you disagree with that law,

2:24:16.800 --> 2:24:18.560
 you can move somewhere else where they may.

2:24:18.560 --> 2:24:21.480
 This is why federalism is such a beautiful system.

2:24:21.480 --> 2:24:23.960
 Even within the United States, we have states.

2:24:23.960 --> 2:24:25.760
 And on certain issues, we're allowed

2:24:25.760 --> 2:24:27.960
 to disagree between states, like the death penalty.

2:24:27.960 --> 2:24:30.000
 Some states do, some states don't.

2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:30.920
 Fine.

2:24:30.920 --> 2:24:33.720
 And now I can move from one state if I don't like it.

2:24:33.720 --> 2:24:36.040
 But there's certain issues you cannot have disagreement.

2:24:36.040 --> 2:24:39.080
 Slavery, for example, this is why we had a civil war.

2:24:39.080 --> 2:24:43.600
 But let me, one other argument against anarchy.

2:24:43.600 --> 2:24:47.960
 Markets exist where force has been eliminated.

2:24:49.080 --> 2:24:50.000
 Sorry, can you say that again?

2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:54.360
 Markets exist where the rule of force has been eliminated.

2:24:55.680 --> 2:24:57.080
 The rule of force?

2:24:57.080 --> 2:24:58.120
 Yes.

2:24:58.120 --> 2:25:02.680
 So a market will exist if we know

2:25:02.680 --> 2:25:05.680
 that you can't pull a gun on me and just take my stuff.

2:25:05.680 --> 2:25:08.080
 I am willing to engage in transaction with you

2:25:08.080 --> 2:25:10.840
 if we have an implicit understanding

2:25:10.840 --> 2:25:13.240
 that we're not gonna use force against each other.

2:25:13.240 --> 2:25:15.600
 So force has something special to it.

2:25:15.600 --> 2:25:16.440
 Yes.

2:25:16.440 --> 2:25:18.800
 It's a special, it overrides,

2:25:18.800 --> 2:25:21.800
 because we are still agreeing we can manipulate each other.

2:25:21.800 --> 2:25:22.840
 Yes.

2:25:22.840 --> 2:25:23.680
 But force we can't.

2:25:23.680 --> 2:25:25.240
 Force kind of,

2:25:25.240 --> 2:25:28.320
 so there's something fundamental about violence.

2:25:28.320 --> 2:25:30.640
 Force is a fundamental force.

2:25:30.640 --> 2:25:32.480
 It's the anti reason.

2:25:32.480 --> 2:25:34.480
 It's the anti life.

2:25:34.480 --> 2:25:38.680
 It's the anti force against another person.

2:25:38.680 --> 2:25:41.600
 And it's what it does is shuts down the mind.

2:25:41.600 --> 2:25:43.040
 Right.

2:25:43.040 --> 2:25:45.920
 So in order to have a market,

2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:48.320
 you have to extract force.

2:25:49.280 --> 2:25:50.120
 That's fascinating.

2:25:50.120 --> 2:25:51.480
 How can you have a market in force?

2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:56.480
 When I, there's an Instagram channel called nature's metal

2:25:56.480 --> 2:26:00.960
 where it has all these videos of animals,

2:26:00.960 --> 2:26:03.160
 basically having a market of force.

2:26:03.160 --> 2:26:04.000
 Yes.

2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:06.040
 But that shuts down the ability to reason

2:26:06.040 --> 2:26:08.000
 and animals don't need to because they can't.

2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:08.840
 Exactly.

2:26:08.840 --> 2:26:10.960
 So the innovation that is human beings

2:26:10.960 --> 2:26:12.440
 is our capacity to reason.

2:26:12.440 --> 2:26:16.000
 And therefore the relegation of force to the animals.

2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:17.440
 We don't do force.

2:26:17.440 --> 2:26:20.200
 Civilization is what we don't have force.

2:26:20.200 --> 2:26:25.200
 And so what you have is you cannot have a market in that,

2:26:25.400 --> 2:26:28.960
 which a market requires the elimination of it.

2:26:28.960 --> 2:26:32.240
 And I don't debate formally these guys,

2:26:32.240 --> 2:26:34.240
 but I interact with them all the time, right?

2:26:34.240 --> 2:26:37.120
 And you get these absurd arguments where,

2:26:37.120 --> 2:26:39.840
 David Friedman will say, that's Milton Friedman's son.

2:26:39.840 --> 2:26:42.760
 He will say something like, well, in Somalia,

2:26:42.760 --> 2:26:43.960
 in the Northern part of Somalia

2:26:43.960 --> 2:26:45.360
 where they have no government,

2:26:45.360 --> 2:26:46.560
 you have all these wonderful,

2:26:46.560 --> 2:26:51.200
 you have these tribal tribunals of these tribes

2:26:51.200 --> 2:26:52.920
 and they resolve disputes.

2:26:52.920 --> 2:26:54.040
 Yeah.

2:26:54.040 --> 2:26:57.080
 Barbarically, they use Sharia law.

2:26:57.080 --> 2:26:58.760
 They have no respect for individual rights,

2:26:58.760 --> 2:27:00.320
 no respect for property.

2:27:00.320 --> 2:27:02.520
 And the only reason they have any authority

2:27:02.520 --> 2:27:04.880
 is because they have guns and they have power

2:27:04.880 --> 2:27:08.600
 and they have force and they do it barbarically.

2:27:08.600 --> 2:27:13.600
 There's nothing civilizing about the courts of Somalian

2:27:14.080 --> 2:27:18.120
 and they write about pirates because they view force.

2:27:18.120 --> 2:27:20.360
 They don't view force as something unique

2:27:20.360 --> 2:27:23.200
 that must be extracted from human life.

2:27:23.200 --> 2:27:26.160
 And that's why anarchy has to devolve into violence

2:27:26.160 --> 2:27:27.640
 because it treats forces just,

2:27:27.640 --> 2:27:32.360
 what's the big deal with negotiating over guns?

2:27:32.360 --> 2:27:34.600
 So we covered a lot of high level philosophy,

2:27:34.600 --> 2:27:39.600
 but I'd like to touch on the troubles, the chaos of the day.

2:27:41.400 --> 2:27:42.480
 Yeah.

2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:43.800
 A couple of things.

2:27:43.800 --> 2:27:48.800
 And I really trying to find a hopeful path way out.

2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:55.080
 So one is the current coronavirus pandemic,

2:27:55.080 --> 2:27:57.120
 or in particular, not the virus,

2:27:57.120 --> 2:28:00.480
 but our handling of it.

2:28:00.480 --> 2:28:04.800
 Is there something philosophically, politically

2:28:04.800 --> 2:28:06.120
 that you would like to see,

2:28:06.120 --> 2:28:08.120
 that you would like to recommend,

2:28:08.120 --> 2:28:11.040
 that you would like to maybe give a hopeful message

2:28:11.040 --> 2:28:12.760
 if we take that kind of trajectory

2:28:12.760 --> 2:28:14.280
 we might be able to get out?

2:28:14.280 --> 2:28:18.200
 Because I'm kind of worried about the economic pain

2:28:18.200 --> 2:28:22.000
 that people are feeling that there's this quiet suffering.

2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:23.560
 I mean, I agree with you completely.

2:28:23.560 --> 2:28:24.640
 There is a quiet suffering.

2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:26.080
 It's horrible.

2:28:26.080 --> 2:28:27.560
 I mean, I know people.

2:28:27.560 --> 2:28:29.400
 I go to a lot of restaurants.

2:28:29.400 --> 2:28:31.680
 One of the things we love to do is eat out.

2:28:31.680 --> 2:28:33.800
 My wife doesn't like cooking anymore.

2:28:33.800 --> 2:28:35.920
 We don't have kids in the house anymore,

2:28:35.920 --> 2:28:36.760
 so she doesn't have to.

2:28:36.760 --> 2:28:37.600
 So we go out a lot.

2:28:37.600 --> 2:28:38.440
 We go to restaurants.

2:28:38.440 --> 2:28:40.520
 And because we have our favorites and we go to them a lot,

2:28:40.520 --> 2:28:44.760
 we get to know the owners of the restaurant, the chef.

2:28:44.760 --> 2:28:46.880
 And it's just heartbreaking.

2:28:46.880 --> 2:28:51.040
 These people put their life, their blood, sweat, and tears.

2:28:51.040 --> 2:28:53.960
 I mean, real blood, sweat, and tears into these projects.

2:28:53.960 --> 2:28:56.960
 Restaurants are super difficult to manage.

2:28:56.960 --> 2:28:58.520
 Most of them go bankrupt anyway.

2:28:59.520 --> 2:29:01.760
 And the restaurants, we go to a good restaurant.

2:29:01.760 --> 2:29:03.040
 So they've done a good job

2:29:03.040 --> 2:29:06.520
 and they offer unique value.

2:29:08.200 --> 2:29:09.400
 And they shut them down.

2:29:10.640 --> 2:29:12.880
 And many of them will never open.

2:29:13.880 --> 2:29:16.120
 Something like the estimate 50, 60% of restaurants

2:29:16.120 --> 2:29:17.600
 in some places won't open.

2:29:17.600 --> 2:29:18.600
 These are people's lives.

2:29:18.600 --> 2:29:19.520
 These are people's capital.

2:29:19.520 --> 2:29:20.520
 These are people's effort.

2:29:20.520 --> 2:29:22.000
 These are people's love.

2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:22.840
 Talk about love.

2:29:22.840 --> 2:29:24.280
 Love what they do.

2:29:24.280 --> 2:29:26.480
 Particularly if they're the chef as well.

2:29:26.480 --> 2:29:27.560
 And it's gone.

2:29:27.560 --> 2:29:28.400
 And it's disappeared.

2:29:28.400 --> 2:29:29.520
 And what are they gonna do with their lives now?

2:29:29.520 --> 2:29:30.600
 They're gonna live off the government

2:29:30.600 --> 2:29:32.520
 the way our politicians would like them.

2:29:32.520 --> 2:29:34.160
 Bigger and bigger stimulus plans

2:29:34.160 --> 2:29:35.720
 so we can hand checks to people

2:29:35.720 --> 2:29:38.360
 to get them used to living off of us rather than.

2:29:38.360 --> 2:29:40.480
 It's disgusting and it's offensive

2:29:40.480 --> 2:29:42.760
 and it's unbelievably sad.

2:29:42.760 --> 2:29:44.440
 And this is where it comes to this.

2:29:44.440 --> 2:29:45.360
 I care about other people.

2:29:45.360 --> 2:29:46.880
 I mean, this idea that objectivists don't care.

2:29:46.880 --> 2:29:50.640
 I mean, I love these people who provide me with pleasure

2:29:50.640 --> 2:29:54.760
 of eating wonderful food in a great environment.

2:29:54.760 --> 2:29:56.680
 And there's something inspiring about them too.

2:29:56.680 --> 2:29:58.480
 Like when I see a great restaurant owner,

2:29:58.480 --> 2:30:00.440
 I wanna do better with my own stuff.

2:30:00.440 --> 2:30:02.080
 Yeah, exactly.

2:30:02.080 --> 2:30:02.920
 They're inspiring.

2:30:02.920 --> 2:30:04.680
 Anybody who does it is excellent.

2:30:04.680 --> 2:30:07.000
 I love sports because it's the one realm

2:30:07.000 --> 2:30:10.800
 in which you'd still value and celebrate excellence.

2:30:10.800 --> 2:30:13.280
 But I try to celebrate excellence everything in my life.

2:30:13.280 --> 2:30:16.600
 So I try to be nice to these people.

2:30:16.600 --> 2:30:20.200
 And with COVID, we went more to restaurants,

2:30:20.200 --> 2:30:23.200
 we did more takeout stuff.

2:30:23.200 --> 2:30:25.400
 We made an effort, particularly the restaurants,

2:30:25.400 --> 2:30:27.360
 we really love to keep them going,

2:30:27.360 --> 2:30:29.160
 to encourage them, to support them.

2:30:30.040 --> 2:30:34.160
 The problem is philosophy drives the world.

2:30:35.360 --> 2:30:38.640
 The response to COVID has been worse than pathetic.

2:30:40.520 --> 2:30:42.120
 And it's driven by philosophy.

2:30:43.080 --> 2:30:46.440
 It's driven by disrespect to science,

2:30:46.440 --> 2:30:48.960
 ignorance and disrespect of statistics,

2:30:48.960 --> 2:30:52.320
 a disrespect of individual human decision making.

2:30:52.320 --> 2:30:55.200
 Government has to decide everything for us.

2:30:55.200 --> 2:30:59.160
 And just throughout the process and a disrespect of markets

2:30:59.160 --> 2:31:02.360
 because we didn't let markets work to facilitate

2:31:02.360 --> 2:31:05.080
 what we needed in order to deal with this virus.

2:31:05.080 --> 2:31:07.320
 If you look at the place, it's interesting

2:31:07.320 --> 2:31:08.640
 that the only place on the planet

2:31:08.640 --> 2:31:11.880
 that's done well with this are parts of Asia, right?

2:31:11.880 --> 2:31:14.440
 Taiwan did phenomenally with this.

2:31:14.440 --> 2:31:18.120
 And the vice president of Taiwan is an epidemiologist.

2:31:18.120 --> 2:31:20.080
 So he knew what he was doing.

2:31:20.080 --> 2:31:22.200
 And they got it right from the beginning.

2:31:22.200 --> 2:31:26.240
 South Korea did amazing, even Hong Kong and Singapore.

2:31:27.280 --> 2:31:29.720
 Hong Kong is just very few deaths.

2:31:31.040 --> 2:31:34.480
 And the economy wasn't shut down in any of those places.

2:31:34.480 --> 2:31:36.920
 There were no lockdowns in any of those places.

2:31:38.600 --> 2:31:43.200
 The CDC had plans before this happened

2:31:43.200 --> 2:31:45.120
 on how to deal with good plans.

2:31:45.120 --> 2:31:48.440
 Indeed, if you ask people around the world before the pandemic

2:31:48.440 --> 2:31:51.440
 which country is best prepared for a pandemic,

2:31:51.440 --> 2:31:53.080
 they would have said the United States

2:31:53.080 --> 2:31:54.760
 because of the CDC's plans

2:31:54.760 --> 2:31:56.840
 and all of our emergency reserves and all that

2:31:56.840 --> 2:31:57.680
 and the wealth.

2:31:59.560 --> 2:32:02.040
 And yet all of that went out the window

2:32:02.040 --> 2:32:06.320
 because people panicked, people didn't think,

2:32:06.320 --> 2:32:09.520
 go back to reason, people were arrogant,

2:32:10.560 --> 2:32:14.440
 refused to use the tools that they had at their disposal

2:32:14.440 --> 2:32:15.600
 to deal with this.

2:32:15.600 --> 2:32:17.560
 So you deal with pandemics, it's very simple

2:32:17.560 --> 2:32:18.400
 how you deal with pandemics.

2:32:18.400 --> 2:32:20.600
 And this is how South Korea and Taiwan and everywhere,

2:32:20.600 --> 2:32:25.600
 you deal with them by testing, tracing and isolating.

2:32:26.680 --> 2:32:28.000
 That's it.

2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:30.280
 And you do it well and you do it vigorously

2:32:30.280 --> 2:32:32.240
 and you do it on scale if you have to.

2:32:32.240 --> 2:32:35.080
 And you scale up to do it and we have the wealth to do that.

2:32:35.080 --> 2:32:40.080
 So one question I have, it's a difficult one.

2:32:40.520 --> 2:32:43.200
 So I talk about love a lot

2:32:43.200 --> 2:32:45.560
 and you've just talked about Donald Trump,

2:32:45.560 --> 2:32:47.880
 I guarantee you though this particular segment

2:32:47.880 --> 2:32:50.240
 will be full of division from the internet.

2:32:51.280 --> 2:32:56.280
 But I believe that should be and can be fixed.

2:32:57.040 --> 2:33:00.440
 What I'm referring to in particular is the division

2:33:00.440 --> 2:33:03.360
 because we've talked about the value of reason.

2:33:04.240 --> 2:33:06.120
 And what I've noticed on the internet

2:33:06.120 --> 2:33:10.200
 is the division shuts down reason.

2:33:10.200 --> 2:33:12.480
 So when people hear you say Trump,

2:33:12.480 --> 2:33:14.600
 actually the first sentence you said about Trump,

2:33:14.600 --> 2:33:17.240
 they'll hear Trump and their ears will perk up

2:33:17.240 --> 2:33:19.720
 and they'll immediately start in that first sentence,

2:33:19.720 --> 2:33:22.760
 they'll say, is he a Trump supporter or a Trump?

2:33:22.760 --> 2:33:24.520
 They're not interested in anything else after that.

2:33:24.520 --> 2:33:26.480
 And then after that, that's it.

2:33:26.480 --> 2:33:29.400
 And what, how do, so my question is,

2:33:30.680 --> 2:33:34.600
 you as one of the beacons of intellectualism,

2:33:34.600 --> 2:33:37.560
 quite honestly, I mean, it sounds silly to say,

2:33:37.560 --> 2:33:40.680
 but you are a beacon of reason.

2:33:40.680 --> 2:33:44.360
 How do we bring people together long enough

2:33:44.360 --> 2:33:46.080
 to where we can reason?

2:33:48.360 --> 2:33:51.040
 I mean, there's no easy way out of this

2:33:51.040 --> 2:33:54.560
 because the fact that people have become tribal

2:33:54.560 --> 2:33:56.400
 and they have, very tribal.

2:33:57.600 --> 2:34:02.600
 And the tribe, in the tribe reason doesn't matter.

2:34:03.600 --> 2:34:04.640
 It's all about emotion.

2:34:04.640 --> 2:34:06.400
 It's all about belonging or not belonging.

2:34:06.400 --> 2:34:08.000
 And you don't wanna stand out.

2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:10.160
 You don't wanna have a different opinion.

2:34:10.160 --> 2:34:11.200
 You wanna belong.

2:34:11.200 --> 2:34:13.400
 And it's all about belonging.

2:34:13.400 --> 2:34:18.360
 It took us decades to get back to tribalism

2:34:18.360 --> 2:34:20.560
 where we were hundreds of years ago.

2:34:20.560 --> 2:34:23.120
 It took millennium to get out of tribalism.

2:34:23.120 --> 2:34:24.280
 It took the enlightenment

2:34:24.280 --> 2:34:26.160
 to get us to the point of individualism,

2:34:26.160 --> 2:34:28.400
 where we think in reason, respect for reason.

2:34:28.400 --> 2:34:30.160
 Before that, we were all tribal.

2:34:30.160 --> 2:34:31.960
 So it took the enlightenment to get us out of it.

2:34:31.960 --> 2:34:34.480
 We've been in the enlightenment for about 250 years,

2:34:34.480 --> 2:34:38.040
 influenced by the enlightenment and it's fading.

2:34:38.040 --> 2:34:39.920
 The impact is fading.

2:34:39.920 --> 2:34:42.280
 So what would we need to get out of it?

2:34:42.280 --> 2:34:43.360
 We need self esteem.

2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:46.800
 People join a tribe

2:34:46.800 --> 2:34:49.000
 because they don't trust their own mind.

2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:51.840
 People join a tribe

2:34:51.840 --> 2:34:54.160
 because they're afraid to stand on their own two feet.

2:34:54.160 --> 2:34:55.920
 They're afraid to think for themselves.

2:34:55.920 --> 2:34:57.160
 They're afraid to be different.

2:34:57.160 --> 2:34:58.360
 They're afraid to be unique.

2:34:58.360 --> 2:35:00.840
 They're afraid to be an individual.

2:35:00.840 --> 2:35:02.440
 People need self esteem.

2:35:02.440 --> 2:35:04.600
 To gain self esteem,

2:35:04.600 --> 2:35:08.840
 they have to have respect for rationality.

2:35:08.840 --> 2:35:10.800
 They have to think and they have to achieve

2:35:10.800 --> 2:35:13.000
 and they have to recognize that achievement.

2:35:14.760 --> 2:35:19.760
 To do that, they have to have respect for thinking.

2:35:19.760 --> 2:35:22.160
 They have to have to respect for reason.

2:35:22.160 --> 2:35:24.800
 And we have to, and think about the schools.

2:35:24.800 --> 2:35:27.640
 We have to have schools that teach people to think,

2:35:27.640 --> 2:35:29.920
 teach people to value their mind.

2:35:29.920 --> 2:35:32.680
 We have schools that teach people to feel

2:35:32.680 --> 2:35:33.800
 and value their feelings.

2:35:33.800 --> 2:35:36.280
 We have groups of six year olds sitting around a circle

2:35:36.280 --> 2:35:37.640
 discussing politics.

2:35:37.640 --> 2:35:38.480
 What?

2:35:38.480 --> 2:35:39.680
 They don't know anything.

2:35:39.680 --> 2:35:41.000
 They're ignorant.

2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:43.280
 See, you don't know anything when you're ignorant.

2:35:43.280 --> 2:35:44.560
 Yes, you can feel,

2:35:44.560 --> 2:35:49.160
 but your feelings are useless as decision making tools.

2:35:49.160 --> 2:35:51.360
 But we emphasize emotion.

2:35:51.360 --> 2:35:53.720
 It's all about socialization and emotion.

2:35:53.720 --> 2:35:57.520
 This is why they talk about this generation of snowflakes.

2:35:57.520 --> 2:36:00.560
 They can't hear anything that they're opposed to

2:36:00.560 --> 2:36:03.440
 because they've not learned how to use their mind,

2:36:03.440 --> 2:36:04.320
 how to think.

2:36:04.320 --> 2:36:08.320
 So it boils down to teaching people how to think two things,

2:36:08.320 --> 2:36:11.400
 how to think and how to care about themselves.

2:36:11.400 --> 2:36:14.440
 So it's thinking of self esteem and the connected,

2:36:14.440 --> 2:36:16.840
 because when you think, you achieve,

2:36:16.840 --> 2:36:19.000
 which gains you self esteem.

2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:20.320
 When you have self esteem,

2:36:20.320 --> 2:36:22.000
 it's easier to think for yourself.

2:36:23.560 --> 2:36:26.240
 And I don't know how you do that quickly.

2:36:26.240 --> 2:36:29.560
 I mean, I think leadership matters.

2:36:29.560 --> 2:36:32.160
 So, you know, part of what I try to do

2:36:32.160 --> 2:36:35.240
 is try to encourage people to do those things.

2:36:35.240 --> 2:36:37.000
 But I am a small voice.

2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:38.240
 You asked me when,

2:36:38.240 --> 2:36:39.400
 early on you said we should talk about

2:36:39.400 --> 2:36:41.080
 why I'm not more famous.

2:36:41.080 --> 2:36:42.160
 I'm not famous.

2:36:42.160 --> 2:36:43.480
 You know, my following is not big.

2:36:43.480 --> 2:36:47.040
 It's very small in the scope of things.

2:36:47.040 --> 2:36:49.840
 Well, yours and objectivism and that question,

2:36:49.840 --> 2:36:51.960
 could you linger on it for a moment?

2:36:51.960 --> 2:36:56.320
 Why isn't objectivism more famous?

2:36:56.320 --> 2:36:59.000
 I think because it's so challenging.

2:36:59.000 --> 2:37:01.080
 It's not challenging.

2:37:01.080 --> 2:37:03.160
 It's not challenging to me, right?

2:37:03.160 --> 2:37:06.040
 When I first encountered objectivism,

2:37:06.040 --> 2:37:08.000
 it's like after the first shock

2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:10.200
 and after the first kind of,

2:37:10.200 --> 2:37:11.240
 none of this can be true.

2:37:11.240 --> 2:37:12.880
 This is all BS.

2:37:12.880 --> 2:37:16.000
 And fighting it, once I got it,

2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:17.840
 it was easy.

2:37:17.840 --> 2:37:19.240
 It required years of studying,

2:37:19.240 --> 2:37:20.480
 but it was easy in the sense of,

2:37:20.480 --> 2:37:21.600
 yes, this makes sense.

2:37:22.760 --> 2:37:25.920
 But it's challenging because it upends everything.

2:37:25.920 --> 2:37:28.880
 It really says what my mother taught me is wrong.

2:37:28.880 --> 2:37:32.760
 And what my politicians say left and right is wrong.

2:37:32.760 --> 2:37:33.720
 All of them.

2:37:33.720 --> 2:37:35.480
 There's not a single politician

2:37:35.480 --> 2:37:39.280
 on which I agree with on almost anything, right?

2:37:39.280 --> 2:37:41.280
 Because on the fundamentals we disagree.

2:37:42.200 --> 2:37:45.360
 And what my teachers are telling me is wrong.

2:37:45.360 --> 2:37:48.400
 And what Jesus said is wrong.

2:37:48.400 --> 2:37:50.560
 And it's hard.

2:37:50.560 --> 2:37:52.040
 But the thing is,

2:37:52.040 --> 2:37:54.640
 so you talk about politics and all that kind of stuff,

2:37:54.640 --> 2:37:56.320
 but you know, most people don't care.

2:37:56.320 --> 2:37:58.800
 The more powerful thing about objectivism

2:37:58.800 --> 2:38:02.240
 is the practical of my life,

2:38:02.240 --> 2:38:04.920
 of how I revolutionized my life.

2:38:04.920 --> 2:38:09.920
 And that feels to be like a very important and appealing,

2:38:10.080 --> 2:38:12.200
 you know, get your shit together.

2:38:12.200 --> 2:38:14.600
 Yeah, but this is why Jordan Peterson

2:38:14.600 --> 2:38:16.360
 is so much more successful than we are, right?

2:38:16.360 --> 2:38:17.440
 Why is that?

2:38:17.440 --> 2:38:18.800
 Make your bed or whatever.

2:38:18.800 --> 2:38:19.640
 What's that?

2:38:19.640 --> 2:38:20.480
 Make your bed.

2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:23.080
 Yeah, because his personal responsibility is shallow.

2:38:24.320 --> 2:38:25.760
 It's make your bed, stand up straight.

2:38:25.760 --> 2:38:27.440
 That's what my mother told me when I was growing up.

2:38:27.440 --> 2:38:29.600
 There's nothing new about Jordan Peterson.

2:38:29.600 --> 2:38:32.160
 He says, embrace Christianity.

2:38:32.160 --> 2:38:34.040
 Christianity is fine, right?

2:38:34.040 --> 2:38:36.000
 Religion is okay.

2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:38.080
 Just do these few things and you'll be fine.

2:38:38.080 --> 2:38:42.360
 And by the way, he says, happiness, you know,

2:38:42.360 --> 2:38:43.640
 you either have it or you don't.

2:38:43.640 --> 2:38:44.720
 You know, it's random.

2:38:44.720 --> 2:38:45.560
 You don't actually,

2:38:45.560 --> 2:38:47.200
 you can't bring about your own happiness.

2:38:47.200 --> 2:38:49.160
 So he's given people an easy out.

2:38:49.160 --> 2:38:50.200
 People want easy outs.

2:38:50.200 --> 2:38:52.560
 People buy self help books

2:38:52.560 --> 2:38:53.920
 that give them five principles

2:38:53.920 --> 2:38:56.200
 or living in, you know, shallow.

2:38:56.200 --> 2:38:58.920
 I'm telling them, think,

2:38:58.920 --> 2:39:02.560
 stand on your own two feet, be independent.

2:39:02.560 --> 2:39:04.920
 Don't listen to your mother.

2:39:04.920 --> 2:39:07.560
 Do your own thing, but thoughtfully,

2:39:07.560 --> 2:39:09.400
 not based on emotions.

2:39:09.400 --> 2:39:10.760
 So you're responsible not just

2:39:10.760 --> 2:39:14.800
 for a set of particular habits and so on.

2:39:14.800 --> 2:39:17.160
 You're responsible for everything.

2:39:17.160 --> 2:39:18.480
 Yes, and you're responsible.

2:39:18.480 --> 2:39:20.040
 Here's the big one, right?

2:39:20.040 --> 2:39:24.440
 You're responsible for shaping your own soul.

2:39:26.160 --> 2:39:27.920
 Your consciousness,

2:39:27.920 --> 2:39:30.960
 you get to decide what it's going to be like.

2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:33.440
 And the only tool you have is your mind.

2:39:33.440 --> 2:39:35.600
 Your only tool is your mind.

2:39:35.600 --> 2:39:37.120
 Well, your emotions play a tool

2:39:37.120 --> 2:39:38.520
 when they're properly cultivated.

2:39:38.520 --> 2:39:40.320
 They play a role in that.

2:39:40.320 --> 2:39:43.080
 And the tools you have is thinking, experiencing,

2:39:43.080 --> 2:39:46.080
 living, coming to the right conclusions,

2:39:46.080 --> 2:39:47.720
 you know, listening to great music

2:39:47.720 --> 2:39:51.800
 and watching good movies and art is very important

2:39:51.800 --> 2:39:55.240
 in shaping your own soul and helping you do this.

2:39:55.240 --> 2:39:58.400
 It's got a crucial role in that.

2:39:58.400 --> 2:40:00.720
 But it's work.

2:40:00.720 --> 2:40:03.520
 And it's lonely work

2:40:03.520 --> 2:40:04.880
 because it's work you do with yourself.

2:40:04.880 --> 2:40:06.960
 Now, if you find somebody who you love

2:40:06.960 --> 2:40:09.200
 who shares these values and you can do with them,

2:40:09.200 --> 2:40:11.960
 that's great, but it's mostly lonely work.

2:40:11.960 --> 2:40:15.680
 It's hard, it's challenging, it ends your world.

2:40:15.680 --> 2:40:17.880
 The reward is unbelievable.

2:40:17.880 --> 2:40:22.880
 But even at that, think about the enlightenment, right?

2:40:23.280 --> 2:40:25.920
 So up until the enlightenment, where was truth?

2:40:25.920 --> 2:40:27.920
 Truth came from a book.

2:40:27.920 --> 2:40:29.840
 And there were a few people who understood the book.

2:40:29.840 --> 2:40:32.520
 Most of us couldn't read and they conveyed it to us.

2:40:32.520 --> 2:40:33.760
 And they just told us what to do.

2:40:33.760 --> 2:40:35.200
 And in that sense, life's easy.

2:40:35.200 --> 2:40:38.400
 It sucks and we die young and we have nothing

2:40:38.400 --> 2:40:41.600
 and we don't enjoy it, but it's easy.

2:40:41.600 --> 2:40:44.400
 And the enlightenment comes around and says,

2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:49.120
 we've got this tool, it's called reason.

2:40:49.120 --> 2:40:51.560
 And it allows us to discover truth about the world.

2:40:51.560 --> 2:40:52.920
 It's not in a book.

2:40:52.920 --> 2:40:54.840
 It's actually your reason allows you

2:40:54.840 --> 2:40:56.440
 to discover stuff about the world.

2:40:56.440 --> 2:40:57.760
 And I consider the first,

2:40:57.760 --> 2:41:01.320
 really the first figure of the enlightenment is Newton,

2:41:01.320 --> 2:41:02.440
 not Locke, right?

2:41:02.440 --> 2:41:03.480
 It's a scientist.

2:41:03.480 --> 2:41:07.920
 Because he teaches us the laws of mechanics,

2:41:07.920 --> 2:41:10.040
 like how does stuff work?

2:41:10.040 --> 2:41:13.200
 And people go, oh, wow, this is cool.

2:41:13.200 --> 2:41:14.560
 I can use my mind.

2:41:14.560 --> 2:41:16.160
 I can discover truth.

2:41:16.160 --> 2:41:18.040
 Isn't that amazing?

2:41:18.040 --> 2:41:19.840
 And everything opens up once you do that.

2:41:19.840 --> 2:41:21.800
 Hey, if I can discover,

2:41:21.800 --> 2:41:23.880
 if I understand the laws of motion,

2:41:23.880 --> 2:41:25.560
 if I can understand truth in the world,

2:41:25.560 --> 2:41:27.560
 how come I can't decide who I marry?

2:41:28.440 --> 2:41:29.880
 I mean, everything was fixed in those days.

2:41:29.880 --> 2:41:33.040
 How come I can't decide what profession I should be in?

2:41:33.040 --> 2:41:35.120
 Right, everybody would belong to a guild.

2:41:35.120 --> 2:41:38.440
 How come I can't decide who my political leader should be?

2:41:38.440 --> 2:41:40.520
 That's, so it's all reason.

2:41:40.520 --> 2:41:43.200
 It's all, once you understand the efficacy of your own mind

2:41:43.200 --> 2:41:45.160
 to understand truth, to understand reality,

2:41:45.160 --> 2:41:48.160
 discover truth, not understand truth, discover it.

2:41:48.160 --> 2:41:49.240
 Everything opens up.

2:41:49.240 --> 2:41:51.240
 Now you can take responsibility for your own life

2:41:51.240 --> 2:41:53.880
 because now you have the tool to do it.

2:41:53.880 --> 2:41:57.160
 But we are living in an era where postmodernism tells us

2:41:57.160 --> 2:41:59.080
 there is no truth, there is no reality,

2:41:59.080 --> 2:42:00.800
 and our mind is useless anyway.

2:42:01.680 --> 2:42:03.640
 Critical race theory tells us

2:42:03.640 --> 2:42:05.400
 that you're determined by your race

2:42:05.400 --> 2:42:06.920
 and your race shapes everything

2:42:06.920 --> 2:42:08.560
 and your free will is meaningless

2:42:08.560 --> 2:42:10.200
 and your reason doesn't matter

2:42:10.200 --> 2:42:12.720
 because reason is just shaped by your genes

2:42:12.720 --> 2:42:15.000
 and shaped by the color of your skin.

2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:17.120
 It's the most racist theory of all.

2:42:17.120 --> 2:42:21.160
 And you've got our friend at UC Irvine telling them,

2:42:21.160 --> 2:42:24.280
 oh, your senses don't tell you anything about reality.

2:42:24.280 --> 2:42:25.440
 Anyway, reality is what it is.

2:42:25.440 --> 2:42:28.200
 So, you know, what's the purpose of reason?

2:42:28.200 --> 2:42:30.000
 It's to invent stuff, it's to make stuff up.

2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:31.000
 And then what use is that?

2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:32.800
 It's complete fantasy.

2:42:32.800 --> 2:42:35.760
 You've basically got every philosophical,

2:42:35.760 --> 2:42:37.560
 intellectual voice in the culture

2:42:37.560 --> 2:42:40.920
 telling them their reason is impotent.

2:42:40.920 --> 2:42:43.640
 There's like a Steven Pinker who tries,

2:42:43.640 --> 2:42:46.040
 and I love Pinker and he's really good

2:42:46.040 --> 2:42:47.040
 and I love his books,

2:42:48.640 --> 2:42:52.320
 but, you know, he needs to be stronger about this.

2:42:52.320 --> 2:42:54.080
 And there's a few people on kind of,

2:42:54.080 --> 2:42:56.520
 there's a few people partially in the intellectual dark web

2:42:56.520 --> 2:42:58.400
 and otherwise who are big on reason

2:42:58.400 --> 2:43:01.560
 but not consistent enough and not full understanding

2:43:01.560 --> 2:43:04.080
 of what it means or what it implies.

2:43:04.080 --> 2:43:05.680
 And then there's little old me.

2:43:05.680 --> 2:43:10.240
 There's a little old me and it's me against the world

2:43:10.240 --> 2:43:13.160
 in a sense, because I'm not only willing to accept,

2:43:13.160 --> 2:43:16.720
 to articulate the case for reason,

2:43:16.720 --> 2:43:18.680
 but then what that implies.

2:43:18.680 --> 2:43:20.680
 It implies freedom, it implies capitalism,

2:43:20.680 --> 2:43:23.360
 it implies taking personal responsibility over your own life.

2:43:23.360 --> 2:43:25.280
 And there are other intellectual dark web people

2:43:25.280 --> 2:43:28.960
 get to reason and then, oh, politics, you can be whatever.

2:43:28.960 --> 2:43:32.440
 No, you can't, you can't be a socialist and for reason.

2:43:32.440 --> 2:43:35.200
 It doesn't actually, those are incompatible.

2:43:35.200 --> 2:43:38.280
 And you can't be a determinist and for reason.

2:43:38.280 --> 2:43:40.680
 Reason and determinism don't go together.

2:43:40.680 --> 2:43:43.640
 The whole point of reason is that it's an achievement

2:43:43.640 --> 2:43:45.600
 and it requires effort and it requires engagement,

2:43:45.600 --> 2:43:47.360
 it requires choice.

2:43:47.360 --> 2:43:49.720
 So it is, it does feel like a little old me

2:43:49.720 --> 2:43:51.560
 because that's it.

2:43:51.560 --> 2:43:53.520
 The allies I have are allies.

2:43:53.520 --> 2:43:56.760
 I have allies among some libertarians over economics.

2:43:56.760 --> 2:43:58.680
 I have some allies in the intellectual dark web

2:43:58.680 --> 2:44:00.000
 maybe over reason,

2:44:00.000 --> 2:44:02.760
 but none of them are allies in the full sense.

2:44:02.760 --> 2:44:04.560
 So my allies are the other objectivists,

2:44:04.560 --> 2:44:06.120
 but they're not a lot of us.

2:44:07.680 --> 2:44:10.320
 For people listening to this,

2:44:10.320 --> 2:44:12.360
 for the few folks kind of listening to this

2:44:12.360 --> 2:44:16.400
 and thinking about the trajectory of their own life,

2:44:17.760 --> 2:44:22.760
 I guess the takeaway is reason is a difficult project,

2:44:23.920 --> 2:44:27.280
 but a project that's worthy of taking on.

2:44:27.280 --> 2:44:30.040
 Yeah, difficulties, I don't know

2:44:30.040 --> 2:44:31.160
 if difficulty is the right word

2:44:31.160 --> 2:44:33.000
 because difficult sounds like it's,

2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:35.200
 I have to push this boulder up a hill.

2:44:35.200 --> 2:44:37.000
 It's not difficult in that sense.

2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:39.040
 It's difficult in the sense that it requires energy

2:44:39.040 --> 2:44:41.720
 and focus, it requires effort,

2:44:41.720 --> 2:44:43.960
 but it's immediately rewarding.

2:44:43.960 --> 2:44:45.880
 It's fun to do.

2:44:45.880 --> 2:44:50.880
 And it rewards immediate, pretty quick, right?

2:44:51.600 --> 2:44:53.960
 It takes a while to undo all the garbage that you have,

2:44:53.960 --> 2:44:56.640
 but we all have that I had that took me years

2:44:56.640 --> 2:44:58.600
 and years and years to get rid of certain concepts

2:44:58.600 --> 2:45:01.960
 and certain emotions that I had that didn't make any sense,

2:45:01.960 --> 2:45:04.960
 but it takes a long time to fully integrate that.

2:45:04.960 --> 2:45:09.240
 So I don't want it to sound like it's a burden,

2:45:09.240 --> 2:45:11.480
 like it's hard in that sense.

2:45:11.480 --> 2:45:13.760
 It does require focus and energy.

2:45:13.760 --> 2:45:16.760
 And I don't want it to sound like a Dr. Spock.

2:45:16.760 --> 2:45:18.640
 I don't want to say, and I don't think I do

2:45:18.640 --> 2:45:20.360
 because I'm a pretty passionate guy,

2:45:20.360 --> 2:45:22.080
 but I don't want it to appeal like,

2:45:22.080 --> 2:45:24.400
 oh, just forget about emotions.

2:45:24.400 --> 2:45:26.880
 Emotions are how you experience the world.

2:45:26.880 --> 2:45:29.680
 You want to have strong emotions.

2:45:29.680 --> 2:45:33.720
 You want to live, you want to experience life strongly

2:45:33.720 --> 2:45:35.720
 and passionately.

2:45:35.720 --> 2:45:39.560
 You just need to know that emotions are not cognition.

2:45:39.560 --> 2:45:40.680
 It's another realm.

2:45:40.680 --> 2:45:42.440
 It's like, don't mix the realms.

2:45:42.440 --> 2:45:45.360
 Think about outcomes and then experience them.

2:45:45.360 --> 2:45:47.320
 And sometimes your emotions won't coincide

2:45:47.320 --> 2:45:49.920
 with what you think should be.

2:45:49.920 --> 2:45:52.640
 And that means there's still more integration to be done.

2:45:53.640 --> 2:45:55.960
 Yaron, as I told you offline,

2:45:55.960 --> 2:45:58.200
 I've been a fan of yours for a long time.

2:45:58.200 --> 2:46:01.720
 It's been, I was a little starstruck early on,

2:46:01.720 --> 2:46:02.560
 getting a little more comfortable now.

2:46:02.560 --> 2:46:03.560
 I believe that's gone.

2:46:05.960 --> 2:46:09.280
 I highly recommend that people

2:46:09.280 --> 2:46:11.320
 that haven't heard your work,

2:46:11.320 --> 2:46:13.600
 listen to it through the Yaron Brook Show.

2:46:15.480 --> 2:46:18.760
 The times I've disagreed with something I've heard you say

2:46:18.760 --> 2:46:21.880
 is usually a first step on a journey

2:46:21.880 --> 2:46:24.320
 of learning a lot more about that thing,

2:46:24.320 --> 2:46:25.720
 about that viewpoint.

2:46:25.720 --> 2:46:27.240
 And that's been so fulfilling.

2:46:27.240 --> 2:46:28.080
 It's been a gift.

2:46:28.080 --> 2:46:32.040
 The passion, you talk about reason a lot,

2:46:32.040 --> 2:46:35.320
 but the passion radiates in a way

2:46:35.320 --> 2:46:38.080
 that's just contagious and uninspiring.

2:46:38.080 --> 2:46:40.920
 So thank you for everything you've done for this world.

2:46:40.920 --> 2:46:43.440
 It's truly an honor and a pleasure to talk to you.

2:46:43.440 --> 2:46:44.280
 Well, thank you.

2:46:44.280 --> 2:46:48.200
 And my reward is that if I've had an impact

2:46:48.200 --> 2:46:49.920
 on you and people like you, wow.

2:46:49.920 --> 2:46:51.240
 I mean, that's amazing.

2:46:51.240 --> 2:46:54.080
 When you wrote to me an email saying you've been a fan,

2:46:54.080 --> 2:46:56.720
 I was blown away because I had no idea

2:46:56.720 --> 2:46:58.320
 and completely unexpected.

2:46:58.320 --> 2:47:02.280
 And every few months I discover,

2:47:02.280 --> 2:47:03.800
 hey, I had an impact on this world

2:47:03.800 --> 2:47:06.560
 and people that I would have never thought.

2:47:06.560 --> 2:47:09.560
 So the only way to change the world

2:47:10.720 --> 2:47:12.600
 is to change your one mind at a time.

2:47:13.600 --> 2:47:18.040
 And when you have an impact on a good mind

2:47:18.040 --> 2:47:20.120
 and a mind that cares about the world

2:47:20.120 --> 2:47:22.480
 and a mind that goes out and does something about it,

2:47:22.480 --> 2:47:24.760
 then you get the exponential growth.

2:47:24.760 --> 2:47:27.760
 So through you, I've impacted other people

2:47:27.760 --> 2:47:31.760
 and that's how you ultimately change everything.

2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:34.200
 And so in spite of everything,

2:47:34.200 --> 2:47:37.000
 I'm optimistic in a sense that I think

2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:39.760
 that the progress we've made today

2:47:39.760 --> 2:47:41.800
 is so universally accepted,

2:47:41.800 --> 2:47:44.280
 the scientific progress, the technological progress,

2:47:44.280 --> 2:47:48.720
 it can just vanish like it did when Rome collapsed.

2:47:48.720 --> 2:47:51.160
 And whether it's in the United States or somewhere,

2:47:51.160 --> 2:47:55.680
 progress will continue, the human project

2:47:55.680 --> 2:47:57.560
 for human progress will continue.

2:47:57.560 --> 2:47:58.920
 And I think these ideas,

2:47:58.920 --> 2:48:00.760
 the ideas of reason and individualism

2:48:00.760 --> 2:48:02.480
 will always be at the heart of it.

2:48:02.480 --> 2:48:05.640
 And what we are doing is continuing

2:48:05.640 --> 2:48:06.960
 the project of the Enlightenment.

2:48:06.960 --> 2:48:11.920
 And it's the project that will save the human race

2:48:11.920 --> 2:48:14.880
 and allow it to, for Elon Musk

2:48:14.880 --> 2:48:19.040
 and for Jeff Bezos to reach the stars.

2:48:19.040 --> 2:48:22.560
 Thank you for masterfully ending on a hopeful note.

2:48:22.560 --> 2:48:24.320
 Yaron, a pleasure and an honor.

2:48:24.320 --> 2:48:25.680
 Thanks.

 And now let me leave you with some words from Ayn Rand.

2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:08.960
 Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark

2:49:09.320 --> 2:49:13.080
 in the hopeless swamps of the not quite,

2:49:13.080 --> 2:49:15.920
 the not yet, and the not at all.

2:49:15.920 --> 2:49:19.000
 Do not let the hero in your soul perish

2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:22.240
 in lonely frustration for the life you deserved

2:49:22.240 --> 2:49:24.800
 and have never been able to reach.

2:49:24.800 --> 2:49:27.360
 The world you desire can be one.

2:49:27.360 --> 2:49:32.360
 It exists, it is real, it is possible, it is yours.

2:49:32.360 --> 2:49:45.360
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
