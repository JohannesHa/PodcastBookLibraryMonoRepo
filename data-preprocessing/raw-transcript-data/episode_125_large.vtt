00:00.000 --> 00:02.860
 The following is a conversation with Ryan Hall,

00:02.860 --> 00:05.460
 one of the most insightful minds and systems thinkers

00:05.460 --> 00:07.000
 in the martial arts world.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
 He's a black belt in jiu jitsu, accomplished competitor,

00:10.000 --> 00:13.120
 an MMA fighter undefeated in the UFC,

00:13.120 --> 00:16.880
 and truly a philosopher who seeks to understand

00:16.880 --> 00:19.760
 the underlying principles of the martial arts.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.280
 Jiu jitsu is such an important part of who I am,

00:22.280 --> 00:23.880
 and I was hoping to share that with folks

00:23.880 --> 00:26.640
 who might know me only as a researcher.

00:26.640 --> 00:29.960
 I think there's no better person to do that with than Ryan,

00:29.960 --> 00:33.920
 who somehow, remarkably, I can say is a friend,

00:33.920 --> 00:37.000
 and also a modern day warrior philosopher

00:37.000 --> 00:40.320
 of the Miyamoto Masashi line of especially dangerous

00:40.320 --> 00:41.600
 and brilliant humans.

00:42.480 --> 00:46.400
 Also, his amazing wife, Jen Hall, was there as well,

00:46.400 --> 00:50.520
 so if you hear a kind of voice of wisdom coming from above,

00:50.520 --> 00:51.720
 you know who it is.

00:51.720 --> 00:53.320
 Quick summary of the sponsors,

00:53.320 --> 00:56.080
 PowerDot, Babbel, and Cash App.

00:56.080 --> 00:58.040
 Please check out the sponsors in the description

00:58.040 --> 01:01.920
 to get a discount and to support this podcast.

01:01.920 --> 01:05.480
 As a side note, let me say that renaming this podcast

01:05.480 --> 01:09.280
 to just my name gave me intellectual freedom

01:09.280 --> 01:12.100
 that I really didn't anticipate was so empowering,

01:12.100 --> 01:15.220
 especially for someone who's trying to find their voice.

01:15.220 --> 01:18.040
 I hope you'll allow me the chance to really try and do that,

01:18.040 --> 01:21.520
 to step outside of AI and even science, engineering,

01:21.520 --> 01:24.640
 history, and so on, and on occasion,

01:24.640 --> 01:28.080
 talk to athletes, musicians, writers,

01:28.080 --> 01:31.680
 and maybe even comedians who inspire me,

01:31.680 --> 01:34.360
 especially up and coming comedians and musicians

01:34.360 --> 01:36.560
 like Eric Weinstein, who yes,

01:36.560 --> 01:39.240
 we'll do a third conversation with soon.

01:39.240 --> 01:41.440
 I think if I allow myself to expand the range

01:41.440 --> 01:43.560
 of these conversations on occasion,

01:43.560 --> 01:45.400
 when I do return to science and engineering,

01:45.400 --> 01:49.680
 I'll bring a new perspective and also a little bit more fun

01:49.680 --> 01:51.960
 and a few extra listeners

01:51.960 --> 01:55.720
 that may not otherwise realize how fascinating

01:55.720 --> 01:58.040
 artificial intelligence, robotics, mathematics,

01:58.040 --> 02:00.840
 and engineering truly is.

02:00.840 --> 02:03.440
 All that said, please skip the episodes

02:03.440 --> 02:04.480
 that don't interest you.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.800
 You don't have to listen to all of them.

02:06.800 --> 02:11.120
 Trust me, as someone who is a bit or a lot OCD,

02:11.120 --> 02:13.120
 that idea is quite unpleasant.

02:13.120 --> 02:17.600
 But life, friends, is full of unpleasant things.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.480
 But as Hunter S. Thompson suggested,

02:19.480 --> 02:20.980
 and I suggest as well,

02:20.980 --> 02:24.440
 you should still buy the ticket and take the ride.

02:24.440 --> 02:26.360

02:30.820 --> 02:34.600
 or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.680
 As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now

02:36.680 --> 02:38.040
 and no ads in the middle.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.780
 I try to make these interesting,

02:39.780 --> 02:41.020
 but I give you the timestamp,

02:41.020 --> 02:43.840
 so please skip if you don't want to listen to the ads,

02:43.840 --> 02:45.800
 but it does mean a lot to me when you do.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.520

03:01.400 --> 03:04.060
 I use it for muscle recovery for legs and shoulders,

03:04.060 --> 03:06.720
 but you can also use it to build muscle,

03:06.720 --> 03:09.200
 endurance, or even just warm up.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.440
 In fact, I first heard about this kind of

03:11.440 --> 03:13.760
 electrical muscle stimulation device

03:13.760 --> 03:15.960
 in reading that Bruce Lee used it.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.080
 He was an inspiration to me

03:18.080 --> 03:21.680
 as someone who practices first principles thinking,

03:21.680 --> 03:22.720
 especially in a discipline

03:22.720 --> 03:25.120
 where conventional thinking is everywhere.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.240
 He created a martial art called Jeet Kune Do

03:27.240 --> 03:30.100
 that is in many ways, at least philosophically

03:30.100 --> 03:31.400
 in its hybrid approach,

03:31.400 --> 03:34.360
 a precursor to modern day mixed martial arts.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.840
 There's a special kind of deep philosophical thinking

03:36.840 --> 03:40.060
 that combat athletes or jiu jitsu practitioners do

03:40.060 --> 03:42.440
 that is unlike any other.

03:42.440 --> 03:45.440
 I think it's grounded in the humbling process

03:45.440 --> 03:47.920
 of getting your ass kicked a lot.

03:47.920 --> 03:51.060
 That removes any illusion of intellectual superiority.

03:51.060 --> 03:53.200
 I think the journey towards wisdom starts

03:53.200 --> 03:55.400
 when you humbly admit to yourself

03:55.400 --> 03:58.880
 that you know very little or almost nothing.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.300
 Anyway, go to PowerDot.com slash Lex

 They offer 14 languages, including Spanish, French,

04:20.960 --> 04:24.180
 Italian, German, and yes, Russian.

04:24.180 --> 04:26.460
 Let me read a few lines from a Russian song

04:26.460 --> 04:28.440
 by Vladimir Vysotsky called

04:28.440 --> 04:30.140
 Anna Bula V Parishe.

04:30.140 --> 04:33.280
 You'll start to understand if you sign up to Babbel.

04:33.280 --> 04:46.880
 The song always made me smile,

04:46.880 --> 04:48.960
 because it resonates with my own life.

04:48.960 --> 04:52.480
 It translates loosely to she's been to Paris.

04:52.480 --> 04:55.920
 Paris for a Russian, I suppose, symbolizing a fancy life

04:55.920 --> 04:58.880
 and that the guy can never quite fit into that kind of life.

04:58.880 --> 05:02.040
 Expensive things, nice restaurants, cars, all that.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.840
 I was thinking about what song's equivalent in English,

05:04.840 --> 05:08.760
 maybe Uptown Girl by Billy Joe is similar in spirit,

05:08.760 --> 05:10.260
 but very different in style.

05:10.260 --> 05:13.700
 I just watched the video on YouTube for Uptown Girl

05:13.700 --> 05:18.080
 and it's basically Billy Joe dressed up as a mechanic,

05:18.080 --> 05:20.220
 but dancing in a way that I'm pretty sure

05:20.220 --> 05:22.520
 no mechanic has ever danced,

05:22.520 --> 05:25.280
 turning the old cringe factor up to 11.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.680
 Anyway, I always felt like I didn't really fit in

05:27.680 --> 05:30.880
 with the fancy people and that's what this song represents.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.400
 But back to Babbel.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.980
 This show is presented by the great, the powerful,

05:39.980 --> 05:42.000
 the OG sponsor named unofficially

05:42.000 --> 05:43.920
 after one of my favorite musicians,

05:43.920 --> 05:46.240
 the man in black, Johnny Cash.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.600
 That's Cash App, the number one finance app

05:48.600 --> 05:49.600
 in the App Store.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.320
 When you get it, use code LEX podcast.

05:52.320 --> 05:55.240
 The Cash App folks are truly amazing people

05:55.240 --> 05:58.000
 and are teaming with ideas for cool contests,

05:58.000 --> 06:00.480
 giveaways and all that kind of stuff.

06:00.480 --> 06:03.080
 I've been thinking of doing some kind of a little contest

06:03.080 --> 06:07.720
 and giving away 42 bucks to a bunch of people who win.

06:07.720 --> 06:08.980
 It's not so much about the money,

06:08.980 --> 06:13.500
 but the glory and a delicious taste of victory.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.960
 If you have ideas for a contest, let me know.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.880
 I was thinking of something like asking people

06:17.880 --> 06:21.280
 to submit funny, inspiring photos or videos or audio

06:21.280 --> 06:25.040
 of using Cash App or any of the sponsors of this podcast,

06:25.040 --> 06:27.860
 really, or maybe even just funny things related

06:27.860 --> 06:30.640
 to the podcast, like different weird places

06:30.640 --> 06:34.120
 you might be watching or listening to me right now.

06:34.120 --> 06:37.020
 I'm pretty sure there's somebody out there right now

06:37.020 --> 06:41.120
 sitting in a hot tub with some wine watching me say this.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.240
 I salute you, sir or madam.

06:44.120 --> 06:47.800
 I may be opening up some floodgates I deeply regret later,

06:47.800 --> 06:50.040
 so please make sure you're wearing clothes

06:50.040 --> 06:51.360
 and whatever you sent me.

06:51.360 --> 06:54.300
 There'll be no naked people in the hot tub

06:54.300 --> 06:56.180
 as part of this podcast.

06:56.180 --> 06:58.820
 I have integrity and standards.

06:59.880 --> 07:01.280
 Let me know in the comments what ideas

07:01.280 --> 07:02.600
 for contests you might have.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.440
 Again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play

07:05.440 --> 07:08.520
 and use the code LexPodcast, you get $10,

07:08.520 --> 07:11.440
 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,

07:11.440 --> 07:14.360
 an organization that is helping to advance robotics

07:14.360 --> 07:17.880
 and STEM education for young people around the world.

07:17.880 --> 07:21.500
 And now, here's my conversation with Ryan Hall.

07:22.440 --> 07:25.600
 Who, in your view, is the greatest warrior in history?

07:25.600 --> 07:27.120
 Ancient or modern?

07:27.120 --> 07:28.880
 That's a tough question, and again,

07:28.880 --> 07:31.480
 I'm no historian by any measure,

07:31.480 --> 07:32.920
 so I'll probably do the worst.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.120
 It's like, what are your best bands ever?

07:34.120 --> 07:37.680
 I'm like, Metallica, and you know, so I'll pick the...

07:37.680 --> 07:39.160
 Metallica just came out with a new album,

07:39.160 --> 07:41.720
 by the way, with an entire orchestra.

07:41.720 --> 07:42.560
 That's kind of cool.

07:42.560 --> 07:43.380
 Yeah. That's important.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.400
 Metallica will always be one of the greatest.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.240
 Yeah, that's right.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.080
 So I agree with you.

07:47.080 --> 07:47.900
 They were a bad example.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.000
 They were a well known, yet awesome band.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.960
 Let me say it's like Nickelback or something like that.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.160
 I mean, that feels cheap

07:52.160 --> 07:53.320
 because everyone makes fun of Nickelback.

07:53.320 --> 07:54.160
 Yeah.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.800
 I guess it depends on how you want to define warrior.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.120
 Something that I think about

07:58.120 --> 08:00.440
 when it comes to trying to evaluate

08:00.440 --> 08:02.480
 various people or situations

08:02.480 --> 08:04.280
 or things that I've read about or heard about

08:04.280 --> 08:07.840
 are the circumstances that they were involved in

08:07.840 --> 08:09.440
 because I think a lot of times

08:09.440 --> 08:11.040
 it's easy to look at the outcomes,

08:11.040 --> 08:13.040
 and obviously we live in an outcome driven world

08:13.040 --> 08:14.600
 and outcomes do matter,

08:14.600 --> 08:18.680
 but at the same time, you look at,

08:18.680 --> 08:20.740
 let's say what Cuba's been able to pull off

08:20.740 --> 08:23.720
 from a combat sports perspective, it's staggering.

08:23.720 --> 08:26.760
 The amount of successful Olympic level competitors

08:26.760 --> 08:28.720
 they have in wrestling, boxing, judo.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.200
 I mean, they're a tiny little island

08:31.200 --> 08:32.680
 with no money and no people.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.760
 That's shocking.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.760
 You know, when you think about the Olympics

08:35.760 --> 08:36.800
 and the United States doing well,

08:36.800 --> 08:37.800
 of course we should do well.

08:37.800 --> 08:39.060
 I mean, Russia should do well.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.560
 China should do well.

08:40.560 --> 08:42.800
 India should do better than they do, honestly.

08:42.800 --> 08:44.520
 Obviously it means like they're not into it as much

08:44.520 --> 08:45.760
 or at least certain sports

08:45.760 --> 08:48.000
 because they have the resources people wise.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.940
 So talent's not going to be an issue.

08:49.940 --> 08:51.240
 So there's something to like

08:51.240 --> 08:53.960
 where the starting point is.

08:53.960 --> 08:56.000
 Like that's the argument with like,

08:56.000 --> 08:57.760
 why people say Maradona,

08:57.760 --> 09:00.700
 I don't know if you're into soccer, okay.

09:00.700 --> 09:03.140
 They say Maradona is better than Messi

09:03.140 --> 09:05.320
 because he basically carried the team

09:05.320 --> 09:07.100
 and won the World Cup with a team

09:07.100 --> 09:09.040
 that wouldn't otherwise win the World Cup.

09:09.040 --> 09:12.960
 And then Messi was only successful in Barcelona

09:12.960 --> 09:15.680
 because he has like superstars,

09:15.680 --> 09:17.360
 he's playing with other superstars.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.180
 Right.

09:18.180 --> 09:19.320
 Yeah, that's fair to say.

09:19.320 --> 09:20.360
 I mean, like you're not,

09:20.360 --> 09:21.680
 there's a lot of factors that go into,

09:21.680 --> 09:23.320
 let's say winning a soccer game.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.960
 And obviously Barcelona,

09:24.960 --> 09:26.400
 particularly for various points in time

09:26.400 --> 09:29.680
 had a ridiculous all star squad of world class players.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.040
 But let's say for instance,

09:32.040 --> 09:34.140
 maybe they didn't have the creative players in Argentina.

09:34.140 --> 09:36.160
 They needed to get the ball up to Messi.

09:36.160 --> 09:37.960
 They didn't have like the NES

09:37.960 --> 09:41.200
 and again the backing there in the midfield.

09:41.200 --> 09:44.000
 But because obviously Argentina's always had

09:44.000 --> 09:45.280
 ridiculous attacking players,

09:45.280 --> 09:46.320
 like even alongside Messi,

09:46.320 --> 09:48.120
 but they're like the three killers up front

09:48.120 --> 09:50.680
 and then a little less behind.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.960
 So it's interesting you say that

09:52.960 --> 09:54.200
 depends how you define warrior

09:54.200 --> 09:55.960
 because you can probably take like

09:55.960 --> 09:57.760
 some of the civil rights leaders,

09:57.760 --> 09:59.160
 you can go into that direction,

09:59.160 --> 10:00.440
 like leaders in general.

10:00.440 --> 10:01.720
 But if we just look at like

10:01.720 --> 10:04.840
 the greatest martial artists in history in that direction,

10:04.840 --> 10:05.720
 do you have somebody in mind?

10:05.720 --> 10:08.360
 I would say at least three that pop into my head

10:08.360 --> 10:12.960
 and would be Hannibal, Alexander the Great,

10:12.960 --> 10:14.960
 and then maybe Miyamoto Musashi,

10:14.960 --> 10:18.560
 the two commanders and then one guy.

10:18.560 --> 10:21.280
 But so it's interesting.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.760
 And then again, you mentioned warriors

10:22.760 --> 10:25.400
 being able to make a lot out of a little.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.960
 Musashi's famous for winning duels

10:27.960 --> 10:31.120
 that were oftentimes one on one.

10:31.120 --> 10:35.080
 The Alexander and Hannibal were military commanders

10:35.080 --> 10:36.760
 and one of them faced Rome.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.280
 And that was an interesting thing.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.600
 Oftentimes coming up with novel tactics,

10:40.600 --> 10:43.960
 different strategies, sometimes under resourced,

10:43.960 --> 10:45.520
 having to do novel and crazy things,

10:45.520 --> 10:46.760
 there's skin in the game.

10:46.760 --> 10:47.840
 That's an interesting thing too.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.840
 I think a lot of times it's,

10:49.840 --> 10:50.800
 if you're playing a video game,

10:50.800 --> 10:51.920
 I don't think you can be a warrior

10:51.920 --> 10:53.760
 because there's no skin in the game.

10:53.760 --> 10:56.000
 You get hurt, you lose, that's a bummer.

10:56.000 --> 10:56.840
 It stings a little bit,

10:56.840 --> 10:58.800
 maybe it makes you feel slightly disappointed,

10:58.800 --> 11:02.800
 but Musashi loses, he loses.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.160
 Hannibal loses, he loses.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.360
 Alexander loses, he loses.

11:05.360 --> 11:08.080
 And they lose, I guess the people around them lose.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.720
 So that's almost like you could use,

11:10.720 --> 11:13.280
 even from a combat sports perspective, Muhammad Ali,

11:13.280 --> 11:15.800
 I mean, you consider also their quality of opposition.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.920
 Musashi was fighting high quality opposition.

11:17.920 --> 11:20.320
 Obviously Hannibal and Alexander, particularly Hannibal,

11:20.320 --> 11:22.280
 were fighting unbelievable opposition.

11:22.280 --> 11:25.200
 Muhammad Ali fought phenomenal opposition,

11:25.200 --> 11:27.240
 but he had skin in the game both in the ring and out.

11:27.240 --> 11:29.320
 And that actually meshes with, as you mentioned,

11:29.320 --> 11:31.320
 like a civil rights type of situation

11:31.320 --> 11:32.960
 where you are under resourced,

11:32.960 --> 11:35.000
 you're pushing the stone uphill.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.600
 And that was a neat thing I think about Muhammad Ali

11:37.600 --> 11:41.040
 was how much personal conviction the man had to have

11:41.040 --> 11:42.560
 in order to pull off what he was able to pull off

11:42.560 --> 11:44.640
 both in and outside of the ring.

11:44.640 --> 11:46.680
 And that reminds me of, again,

11:46.680 --> 11:47.600
 some of the other great leaders

11:47.600 --> 11:48.880
 or great fighters throughout history.

11:48.880 --> 11:53.400
 So what do you make of the kind of very difficult idea

11:53.400 --> 11:56.640
 that some of these conquerors like Alexander the Great

11:56.640 --> 12:00.920
 and somebody that, if you listen to Hardcore History,

12:00.920 --> 12:04.000
 oh, Dan Carlin, who apparently Elon Musk

12:04.000 --> 12:07.420
 is also a big fan of, is the Genghis Khan episode.

12:07.420 --> 12:12.420
 A large percent of the world can call Genghis Khan

12:18.580 --> 12:20.140
 an ancestor.

12:20.140 --> 12:24.220
 So the difficult truth is about some of these conquerors

12:24.220 --> 12:28.900
 is that there's a lot of murder and rape and pillage

12:28.900 --> 12:32.220
 and stealing of resources and all that kind of stuff.

12:32.220 --> 12:37.100
 And yet they're often remembered as quite honorable.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.580
 I mean, in the case of Genghis Khan,

12:38.580 --> 12:39.980
 there's a lot of people who argue,

12:39.980 --> 12:43.100
 if you look at historically the way it's described

12:44.100 --> 12:47.340
 in full context, is he was ultimately,

12:49.220 --> 12:52.300
 given the time, he was a liberator.

12:52.300 --> 12:56.020
 He was a progressive, I should say.

12:57.260 --> 13:02.260
 In terms of the violence and the atrocities he committed,

13:02.260 --> 13:06.620
 he, at least in the stories, has always provided the option

13:06.620 --> 13:07.820
 of not to do that.

13:07.820 --> 13:10.340
 It's only if you resist, do,

13:10.340 --> 13:11.380
 so you basically have the option,

13:11.380 --> 13:14.660
 do you wanna join us or do you want to die?

13:14.660 --> 13:16.140
 And die horribly.

13:17.940 --> 13:19.820
 That's the progressive sort of,

13:19.820 --> 13:21.540
 that's the Bernie Sanders of the era.

13:21.540 --> 13:22.500
 Nice.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.260
 So what do you make of that?

13:24.260 --> 13:27.620
 That there's so much of these great conquerors,

13:27.620 --> 13:32.620
 there's so much murder that to us now would just seem insane.

13:33.300 --> 13:34.580
 It's funny you mention it.

13:34.580 --> 13:37.220
 I think that maybe it's a human nature thing

13:37.220 --> 13:40.980
 that we want to, or maybe a misunderstanding thing

13:40.980 --> 13:44.260
 that we want to cast all of our characters and ourselves

13:44.260 --> 13:47.540
 maybe as entirely good or as entirely negative

13:47.540 --> 13:50.700
 when I guess the phrase or the saying,

13:50.700 --> 13:54.140
 one man's freedom fighter is another person's terrorist,

13:54.140 --> 13:55.420
 is accurate.

13:55.420 --> 13:57.700
 And a lot of times I think you can understand

13:57.700 --> 13:59.460
 as long as you're able to look

13:59.460 --> 14:00.780
 from various people's perspective.

14:00.780 --> 14:03.220
 Like if you look at the TV show, The Wire,

14:03.220 --> 14:06.500
 which was obviously widely, everybody loves The Wire.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.020
 I thought that there were everyone,

14:08.020 --> 14:10.060
 I'm not saying anything that's not been said before,

14:10.060 --> 14:11.420
 compelling characters from all angles,

14:11.420 --> 14:13.660
 whether you like the character, dislike the character,

14:13.660 --> 14:16.140
 you were able to understand the motivations of people

14:16.140 --> 14:17.300
 doing various things.

14:17.300 --> 14:20.180
 Even if they did wrongly, they did rightly.

14:20.180 --> 14:23.740
 We want to cast all of the demons throughout history

14:23.740 --> 14:27.060
 as completely inhuman when I think that makes it difficult

14:27.060 --> 14:27.980
 for us to understand them.

14:27.980 --> 14:30.580
 And we want to look back at the people

14:30.580 --> 14:33.940
 that we think of as great and entirely great.

14:33.940 --> 14:37.220
 And I think that we're experiencing the problems with this

14:37.220 --> 14:38.820
 even right now, socially and politically

14:38.820 --> 14:40.180
 as we're trying to look back and decide

14:40.180 --> 14:41.620
 the people we thought were good or not good

14:41.620 --> 14:43.420
 or people we thought were bad are now good

14:43.420 --> 14:46.580
 rather than going, hey, there's good and bad to all things.

14:46.580 --> 14:49.780
 And there are, as you mentioned, the Genghis Khan thing,

14:49.780 --> 14:51.180
 you don't have to fight back.

14:52.220 --> 14:53.580
 You do, I respect you for it,

14:53.580 --> 14:54.900
 but then we're gonna have a conflict

14:54.900 --> 14:56.300
 and then we'll see what happens.

14:56.300 --> 14:58.020
 And if you lose, you're gonna be sorry that you did

14:58.020 --> 14:59.780
 because I have to make it that way.

14:59.780 --> 15:02.540
 If I want to continue utilizing this kind of MO

15:02.540 --> 15:05.300
 because I need to discourage the next guy

15:05.300 --> 15:07.300
 from doing what you're doing right now.

15:07.300 --> 15:10.220
 And ultimately though, I guess that's an interesting thing.

15:10.220 --> 15:11.860
 Imagine you put every single person

15:11.860 --> 15:16.660
 on planet earth in a cage, crime drops, all sorts.

15:16.660 --> 15:18.580
 There are certain positives to that.

15:18.580 --> 15:23.140
 And it's just, things are as they are, it's difficult,

15:23.140 --> 15:25.140
 but that is ultimately more the law of the jungle.

15:25.140 --> 15:27.900
 And I think that we're able to supersede some of that now

15:27.900 --> 15:30.180
 in modern times and I think we're fortunate.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.180
 But as you mentioned, we look back and say,

15:32.180 --> 15:33.500
 oh, this is horrible.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.620
 Say, no, that just is what it is.

15:35.620 --> 15:37.980
 That's how life is at a base level.

15:37.980 --> 15:40.420
 And again, if you're a lion and I'm a gazelle,

15:40.420 --> 15:42.380
 I don't really like it very much,

15:42.380 --> 15:44.860
 but we don't call the lion the bad guy.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.780
 We don't sanctify the gazelle or the other way around.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.100
 So it's just, it's interesting when you pull back

15:50.100 --> 15:53.020
 some of the controls that we put on our behavior

15:53.020 --> 15:54.500
 and in modern life,

15:54.500 --> 15:56.940
 which I think are generally speaking positive,

15:56.940 --> 15:59.140
 we get down to how things often are.

15:59.140 --> 16:02.860
 And at the same time, we could,

16:02.860 --> 16:06.460
 modern life was built by people like Genghis Khan.

16:06.460 --> 16:09.540
 So then you get down to the ends justifying the means.

16:09.540 --> 16:10.380
 It's a tough question.

16:10.380 --> 16:11.740
 These aren't things with easy answers,

16:11.740 --> 16:14.020
 or at least if they are, I certainly don't have the smarts

16:14.020 --> 16:18.060
 to figure out the answers to them, but it's difficult.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.140
 I would just say people in the world are complicated

16:20.140 --> 16:22.140
 and layered and depending upon which side of the line

16:22.140 --> 16:23.940
 you're standing on at various times,

16:23.940 --> 16:26.500
 you may like or dislike someone,

16:26.500 --> 16:30.300
 but I can't remember whose idea it was,

16:30.300 --> 16:31.900
 this is killing me, but it's the veil of ignorance,

16:31.900 --> 16:36.540
 I guess, the philosophical idea of the veil of ignorance

16:36.540 --> 16:39.340
 where I go, is sticking everyone in the cage

16:39.340 --> 16:41.100
 the right thing to do?

16:41.100 --> 16:43.460
 Or everyone but me, and I say, well, no, why?

16:43.460 --> 16:44.740
 Well, it would make my life easier

16:44.740 --> 16:46.140
 if I just went over and took all of your stuff

16:46.140 --> 16:47.780
 as long as you couldn't stop me.

16:47.780 --> 16:48.820
 I mean, of course that's a great idea.

16:48.820 --> 16:50.500
 That's what everyone does in every video game.

16:50.500 --> 16:53.460
 But in Skyrim, you steal stuff when people aren't around.

16:53.460 --> 16:56.140
 But ultimately you go, well,

16:56.140 --> 16:57.220
 this isn't the right thing to do

16:57.220 --> 16:59.020
 because if I were on the other side of it,

16:59.020 --> 17:00.860
 I would not appreciate it.

17:00.860 --> 17:02.660
 It's inherently not a good thing to do.

17:02.660 --> 17:04.820
 I'm only doing it because I think I'm gonna win.

17:04.820 --> 17:06.580
 And that's a fine way to be,

17:06.580 --> 17:08.860
 but you don't have the white hat on, I guess I would say.

17:08.860 --> 17:12.340
 So I think without those philosophical underpinnings

17:12.340 --> 17:15.300
 to rein us in, I guess, morally speaking,

17:15.300 --> 17:17.580
 it's very difficult to say what's right or wrong.

17:17.580 --> 17:20.220
 And you'd say certain actions have a reaction,

17:20.220 --> 17:21.860
 almost like a physics sense.

17:21.860 --> 17:24.140
 If you kill everyone in your way

17:24.140 --> 17:27.780
 for as long as you're able to, your life will be easier.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.700
 I mean, you're setting the table for someone

17:29.700 --> 17:31.580
 doing the same to you when you're no longer the tough guy,

17:31.580 --> 17:32.860
 but it is what it is.

17:32.860 --> 17:35.860
 Yeah, if you look at like the Instagram channel,

17:35.860 --> 17:39.780
 nature is metal, it hurts my heart to watch,

17:39.780 --> 17:44.540
 to remind me, a comfortable descendant of ape,

17:44.540 --> 17:52.460
 how vicious nature is, just unapologetically, just,

17:52.460 --> 17:58.540
 I mean, there's a process to it where the bad guy always wins.

17:58.540 --> 18:04.220
 The violence is the solution to most problems,

18:04.220 --> 18:07.500
 or the flip side of that running away from violence

18:07.500 --> 18:10.140
 is the solution depending on your skillset.

18:10.140 --> 18:12.620
 And it's funny to think of us humans

18:12.620 --> 18:15.020
 with our extra little piece of brain

18:15.020 --> 18:17.180
 that we're somehow trying to figure out,

18:17.180 --> 18:18.700
 like you said, in a philosophical way,

18:18.700 --> 18:23.020
 how to supersede that, how to like move past the viciousness,

18:23.020 --> 18:30.220
 the cruelty, just the cold exchange of nature.

18:30.220 --> 18:33.580
 But perhaps it's not so, maybe that is nature,

18:33.580 --> 18:38.460
 maybe that's the way of life, maybe we're trying too hard to,

18:38.460 --> 18:43.340
 we're being too egotistical and thinking we're somehow

18:43.340 --> 18:45.420
 separate from nature, we're somehow distant

18:45.420 --> 18:46.460
 from that very thing.

18:46.460 --> 18:47.580
 I couldn't agree with you more.

18:47.580 --> 18:49.580
 In fact, I think actually Orson Scott Card,

18:49.580 --> 18:51.740
 who's the writer of a great book called Ender's Game,

18:53.820 --> 18:56.540
 this was a statement that the main character,

18:56.540 --> 18:58.380
 Ender, made in the book.

18:58.380 --> 18:59.740
 His brother was brilliant.

19:00.300 --> 19:04.220
 His brother was like kind of sociopathic brilliant kid

19:04.220 --> 19:05.740
 that ended up kicked out of the school

19:05.740 --> 19:07.980
 that they were all into for Battle Commander.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.700
 Dealing with his brother taught him that ultimately strength,

19:10.700 --> 19:12.860
 courage, the ability to do violence

19:12.860 --> 19:14.300
 for all the good and the bad of that

19:14.300 --> 19:16.860
 is one of the fundamental most important things

19:16.860 --> 19:17.820
 to be able to do in life,

19:17.820 --> 19:19.420
 because if you can't cause destruction,

19:19.420 --> 19:20.780
 if you can't cause pain,

19:20.780 --> 19:23.020
 you will be forever subject to those who can.

19:23.020 --> 19:25.020
 And I think that you mentioned egotism.

19:25.020 --> 19:26.540
 I think that that's a disease

19:26.540 --> 19:28.300
 that could obviously strike any of us,

19:28.300 --> 19:29.660
 but it's something that we're looking at now.

19:29.660 --> 19:33.100
 We're, I think we should be unbelievably thankful

19:33.100 --> 19:35.260
 as people that live in the world that we do

19:35.260 --> 19:36.860
 that we can walk down the street

19:36.860 --> 19:38.620
 without having to worry that I'm like,

19:38.620 --> 19:40.460
 well, don't worry that that's six foot six,

19:40.460 --> 19:43.660
 270 pound person over there is just gonna leave me alone.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.900
 And I have a Rolex on, but whatever, I'll be fine.

19:45.900 --> 19:47.900
 Because that person is deciding to leave me alone

19:47.900 --> 19:51.740
 because we've all agreed to live in this relatively sane

19:51.740 --> 19:54.780
 and or constrained society because it benefits all of us.

19:54.780 --> 19:57.820
 And we're doing it because of a philosophical underpinning,

19:57.820 --> 19:59.660
 not because nature dictates it be that way,

19:59.660 --> 20:01.340
 because nature dictates it go in a very,

20:01.340 --> 20:02.220
 very different direction.

20:02.220 --> 20:03.100
 And the only person,

20:03.100 --> 20:04.220
 the only thing stopping that person

20:04.220 --> 20:08.300
 from doing something to me is either me, that person,

20:08.300 --> 20:10.540
 or someone else that will stand in between us.

20:10.540 --> 20:11.980
 And if I can't do it,

20:11.980 --> 20:13.660
 and there's no one there to stand in between us,

20:13.660 --> 20:16.460
 then the only thing stopping that person is that person.

20:16.460 --> 20:19.100
 And I have to hope that they're either disinterested

20:19.100 --> 20:21.340
 or disinclined to do that sort of thing.

20:21.340 --> 20:24.700
 And I think that it's keeping in mind

20:24.700 --> 20:27.900
 that that is the fundamental nature of the world,

20:27.900 --> 20:30.540
 whether we like it or not is important.

20:30.540 --> 20:34.860
 And I think the quest to fundamentally alter human nature

20:34.860 --> 20:36.380
 is gonna be ultimately fruitless.

20:36.380 --> 20:38.780
 And then also it's, it is a little bit egotistical.

20:38.780 --> 20:40.620
 A lion does what a lion does.

20:40.620 --> 20:44.300
 We can try to box it in and we can try to guide

20:44.300 --> 20:45.420
 this direction, that direction.

20:45.420 --> 20:49.340
 But nature is as it is and as it always will be

20:49.340 --> 20:52.620
 unless we wanna start to constrain it significantly.

20:52.620 --> 20:55.420
 But now I'm starting to get into individual rights

20:55.420 --> 20:56.460
 who put me in charge,

20:56.460 --> 20:57.580
 who says that I should be the one

20:57.580 --> 20:58.780
 to make the choices constraining

20:58.780 --> 21:00.700
 because many of the most awful things

21:00.700 --> 21:02.300
 that have happened throughout history,

21:02.300 --> 21:05.180
 one group or one person has decided to constrain others.

21:05.740 --> 21:08.060
 And we don't like Genghis Khan doing that.

21:08.060 --> 21:10.140
 Well, I'll do that on a little level.

21:10.140 --> 21:12.620
 Are there gonna be benefits and beneficiaries?

21:12.620 --> 21:15.100
 Absolutely, but there'll be losers in that too.

21:15.100 --> 21:16.460
 So I guess it's a dangerous game.

21:16.460 --> 21:17.980
 It's almost like putting on the one ring.

21:17.980 --> 21:20.860
 You remember when Frodo offered the one ring to Gandalf

21:20.860 --> 21:23.180
 and Gandalf said, no, no, I would take it away.

21:23.180 --> 21:24.300
 I would put it on.

21:24.300 --> 21:26.300
 I would use it out of the desire to do good.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.940
 But through me, it would wield a power so terrible

21:28.940 --> 21:29.980
 you can't imagine.

21:29.980 --> 21:33.180
 I think that's the big question for anyone that decides

21:33.180 --> 21:36.300
 that's able to have reach and able to have power.

21:36.300 --> 21:38.380
 I mean, obviously I can't speak to that,

21:38.380 --> 21:41.020
 but imagine you did have national level,

21:41.020 --> 21:42.460
 global level power.

21:42.460 --> 21:43.420
 How would you use it?

21:43.420 --> 21:44.860
 Would you try to change the world?

21:45.660 --> 21:47.500
 Would you be glad that you did down the line?

21:47.500 --> 21:48.000
 I don't know.

21:48.860 --> 21:52.060
 Yeah, that's the thing we're struggling now as a society.

21:52.060 --> 21:54.700
 Maybe it'd be nice to get your quick comment on that,

21:54.700 --> 21:58.620
 which is the people who have traditionally been powerless

21:59.580 --> 22:05.500
 are now seeking a fairer society, a more equal society.

22:05.500 --> 22:11.500
 And in attaining more power justly,

22:12.460 --> 22:16.140
 there's also a realization, at least from my perspective,

22:16.140 --> 22:18.300
 that power corrupts everyone.

22:18.300 --> 22:26.940
 Even if the flag you wave is that of justice, right?

22:26.940 --> 22:31.580
 And so, not to overuse the term, but it'd be nice

22:31.580 --> 22:34.620
 if you have thoughts about the whole idea of cancel culture

22:34.620 --> 22:39.580
 and the internet and Twitter and so on,

22:39.580 --> 22:45.340
 where there's nuanced, difficult discussions of race,

22:45.340 --> 22:51.580
 of gender, of fairness, equality, justice,

22:51.580 --> 22:52.700
 all of these kinds of things.

22:53.260 --> 22:57.740
 There's a shouting down oftentimes of nuanced discussion

22:57.740 --> 23:04.860
 of kind of trying to reason through these very difficult issues,

23:04.860 --> 23:07.420
 through our history, through what our future looks like.

23:07.420 --> 23:10.220
 Do you have thoughts about the internet discourse

23:10.220 --> 23:11.420
 that's going on now?

23:11.420 --> 23:12.620
 Is there something positive?

23:12.620 --> 23:16.780
 Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting thing to see.

23:16.780 --> 23:17.980
 I guess, as you mentioned,

23:19.500 --> 23:22.860
 anytime you're wielding power, whomever you are,

23:22.860 --> 23:24.860
 doing so carefully is important.

23:24.860 --> 23:28.380
 And it's very, very easy to look at the people that have power

23:28.380 --> 23:31.340
 and that are using it poorly or have used it poorly

23:31.340 --> 23:32.460
 and go, hey, you're the bad guy.

23:33.260 --> 23:35.420
 And then go, well, of course, if I had power,

23:35.420 --> 23:38.140
 I'll use it properly and I may intend to use it properly

23:38.140 --> 23:38.860
 and maybe I will.

23:38.860 --> 23:43.020
 But at the same time, we see a lot of times

23:43.580 --> 23:44.860
 people are people are people.

23:44.860 --> 23:48.460
 I think that a lot of the...

23:48.460 --> 23:52.300
 I think if you believe that human beings are all one,

23:52.300 --> 23:54.540
 which I do, no matter whether you're here or there,

23:54.540 --> 23:57.820
 you got two arms, two legs, a heart, a brain,

23:57.820 --> 24:00.300
 we all live a similar experience.

24:00.300 --> 24:02.620
 And obviously, with variations on a theme,

24:02.620 --> 24:05.660
 but you're no less a human being.

24:05.660 --> 24:07.740
 If you're a person I've never met from China,

24:07.740 --> 24:12.140
 than some person in Virginia, we're all people.

24:12.140 --> 24:14.860
 And I guess, ultimately, if I believe that human beings

24:14.860 --> 24:16.380
 are corruptible and that power corrupts

24:16.380 --> 24:19.820
 and that we're all fallible and we say and do things

24:19.820 --> 24:22.060
 that either intentionally or unintentionally

24:22.860 --> 24:28.140
 that we wish we'd not, I think that I have to allow

24:28.140 --> 24:31.740
 for a space, I guess the word, it's almost a religious term,

24:31.740 --> 24:33.100
 but I guess I would just say grace.

24:33.100 --> 24:36.540
 And that's something that I see disappearing from discourse

24:36.540 --> 24:39.100
 in the public, or maybe it wasn't there, I'm not sure,

24:39.100 --> 24:42.060
 but it's interesting watching this occur on the internet

24:42.060 --> 24:45.740
 because also now no longer are you and I just having a talk

24:45.740 --> 24:48.460
 sitting on a bus stop, it's now in writing.

24:48.460 --> 24:49.180
 Everything's in writing.

24:49.180 --> 24:51.340
 The old saying, don't put that in writing.

24:51.340 --> 24:52.540
 You're like, don't put anything in writing.

24:52.540 --> 24:53.580
 That's how you get in trouble.

24:53.580 --> 24:57.180
 And basically, with the degree to which everything

24:57.180 --> 24:59.340
 is recorded, but recorded in tiny little bites,

24:59.340 --> 25:02.860
 it's very, very easy for me to wave every last little foolish,

25:02.860 --> 25:05.420
 ignorant, incorrect, or correct thing that someone

25:05.420 --> 25:08.460
 has ever said or done in their face to support whatever

25:08.460 --> 25:11.500
 argument that I'm trying to make about them or a situation.

25:11.500 --> 25:14.620
 And I think that you mentioned cancel culture,

25:15.340 --> 25:16.300
 as it seems to exist.

25:16.300 --> 25:17.740
 Obviously, this is poisonous on its face.

25:17.740 --> 25:18.540
 This is poisonous.

25:20.140 --> 25:22.540
 It's the sort of thing that doesn't incentivize

25:22.540 --> 25:23.820
 proper behavior.

25:23.820 --> 25:26.380
 I mean, you look at, let's say one of the great monsters

25:26.380 --> 25:30.460
 of history, Adolf Hitler, obviously, who's done awful,

25:30.460 --> 25:33.020
 awful things, but also for anyone that's even a minor

25:33.020 --> 25:35.580
 student of history, did some positive things as well.

25:36.620 --> 25:39.340
 I don't have to embroider this person's crimes.

25:39.340 --> 25:43.340
 I don't have to act as if there was nothing good a monster has

25:43.340 --> 25:46.540
 ever done and nothing bad that a great person throughout history

25:46.540 --> 25:47.500
 has ever done.

25:47.500 --> 25:50.700
 But imagine the ghost of Adolf Hitler were to pop up and go,

25:50.700 --> 25:52.460
 oh, my gosh, guys, I'm so sorry.

25:52.460 --> 25:55.500
 I know what I've done, but I'd like to apologize and start

25:55.500 --> 25:56.220
 to make it right.

25:56.780 --> 25:59.180
 Well, I mean, you'd hope that if he popped up over here,

25:59.180 --> 26:01.340
 you'd go, well, I don't really like what you've done.

26:01.340 --> 26:02.380
 And I don't like you.

26:02.380 --> 26:04.940
 But at the same time, I'm glad to hear that you're attempting

26:04.940 --> 26:07.180
 to make this right and push in a positive direction, even if

26:07.180 --> 26:08.300
 you can't make it right.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.980
 Because otherwise, what am I doing?

26:09.980 --> 26:12.460
 I'm disincentivizing change for the better.

26:12.460 --> 26:15.500
 I'm looking to wield whatever power I have in a punitive

26:15.500 --> 26:19.340
 fashion, which does not encourage people to do anything

26:19.340 --> 26:22.220
 other than double down on the wrongs that they've made,

26:22.220 --> 26:24.540
 knowing that at least they're going to have some support from

26:24.540 --> 26:26.220
 the people that support that.

26:26.220 --> 26:30.540
 And I guess I want to, you would hopefully look at the use

26:30.540 --> 26:34.140
 of the internet as a tool that can educate, and I guess I

26:34.140 --> 26:36.860
 don't like the word empower, but empower people to do various

26:36.860 --> 26:40.220
 things, extend their reach, but educate and learn rather than

26:40.220 --> 26:44.300
 to further solidify little tribal things that exist, which

26:44.300 --> 26:47.180
 I think everyone in humanity and human history is vulnerable

26:47.180 --> 26:47.340
 to.

26:47.340 --> 26:48.940
 I mean, look at the course of human history.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.300
 It's deeply tribal.

26:50.300 --> 26:53.420
 And the tribes or the groups that have been on top at various

26:53.420 --> 26:56.620
 points in time have done a lot of times bad things to the

26:56.620 --> 26:57.900
 ones that have not.

26:57.900 --> 27:00.300
 And you'd hope that we could learn lessons from the past

27:00.300 --> 27:04.940
 and rather than committing the crimes that were committed

27:04.940 --> 27:07.980
 against us, recommitting them when we slide into the top

27:07.980 --> 27:12.140
 position, say, I could do this now, but I'll not.

27:12.140 --> 27:15.180
 I understand the urge to seek vengeance is strong.

27:15.180 --> 27:17.020
 Anyone that says differently, I wouldn't trust.

27:18.140 --> 27:21.900
 But at the same time, we have enough experience in history,

27:21.900 --> 27:25.340
 enough experience in life, enough hopefully wisdom time in

27:25.340 --> 27:27.820
 to go, this isn't the right answer.

27:27.820 --> 27:29.820
 This is only going to replay the things.

27:29.820 --> 27:31.980
 The worst parts of our history, not the best.

27:31.980 --> 27:34.540
 And I want to encourage positive behavior.

27:34.540 --> 27:37.660
 And if I just, again, further lash out at people, although

27:37.660 --> 27:41.180
 understandably, done understandably, I'm simply just

27:41.180 --> 27:43.500
 going to just perpetuate the cycle that's gone on to this

27:43.500 --> 27:44.060
 point.

27:44.060 --> 27:47.660
 So you hope that even though we're seeing a lot of turmoil

27:47.660 --> 27:51.180
 societally at the moment and globally at the moment, that I

27:51.180 --> 27:53.500
 guess our better angels can prevail at a certain point.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.420
 But it's going to take a great deal of leadership.

27:55.420 --> 27:58.700
 And I think that we're sorely missing like a Martin Luther

27:58.700 --> 28:01.020
 King style character at the moment or a great leader.

28:01.020 --> 28:04.220
 And I'm hoping that one will show up.

28:04.220 --> 28:05.420
 For sure.

28:05.420 --> 28:08.540
 And by the way, a word I don't hear often, and I think it's

28:08.540 --> 28:10.460
 a beautiful one, which is grace.

28:10.460 --> 28:11.660
 That's a really interesting word.

28:11.660 --> 28:12.780
 I'm going to have to think about that.

28:13.740 --> 28:16.940
 There is a religious component to it, but it's exactly right.

28:18.620 --> 28:23.980
 You have to somehow walk the line between, you know, you

28:23.980 --> 28:24.940
 mentioned Hitler.

28:24.940 --> 28:28.460
 I've been reading The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.

28:28.460 --> 28:33.820
 I'm really thinking about the 1930s and what it's like to

28:33.820 --> 28:36.140
 have economic.

28:36.860 --> 28:40.300
 My concern is the economic pain that people are feeling now

28:41.100 --> 28:45.660
 quietly is really a suffering that's not being heard.

28:46.380 --> 28:50.780
 And there's echoes of that in the 20s and the 30s with the

28:50.780 --> 28:51.500
 Great Depression.

28:52.300 --> 28:55.260
 And there's a hunger for a charismatic leader.

28:55.260 --> 28:59.500
 Like you said, there's a leader that could walk with grace,

29:00.060 --> 29:07.100
 could inspire, could bring people together with sort of dreams

29:07.100 --> 29:09.260
 of a better future that's positive.

29:09.900 --> 29:14.140
 But Hitler did exactly everything that I just said, except

29:14.140 --> 29:18.780
 for the word positive, which is he did give a dream to the

29:18.780 --> 29:21.820
 German people who were great people, who are great people

29:21.820 --> 29:24.540
 of a better future.

29:25.260 --> 29:31.420
 It's just that a certain point that quickly turned into the

29:31.420 --> 29:37.900
 better future requires literally expansion of more land.

29:37.900 --> 29:42.460
 It started with, well, if we want to build a great Germany,

29:42.460 --> 29:43.980
 we need a little bit more land.

29:44.620 --> 29:49.180
 And so we need to kind of get Austria, then we need to kind

29:49.180 --> 29:55.100
 of get France, mostly because France doesn't understand that

29:55.100 --> 29:56.300
 more land is really useful.

29:56.300 --> 29:57.420
 So we need to get rid of them.

29:57.420 --> 29:59.260
 And look what they did to us in Versailles anyway.

30:01.820 --> 30:09.980
 But so the Jewish, the Holocaust is a separate thing.

30:09.980 --> 30:10.460
 I don't know.

30:12.060 --> 30:12.620
 Well, I don't know.

30:12.620 --> 30:15.820
 I don't know what to think of it because so me being Jewish

30:15.820 --> 30:21.900
 and having a lot of the echoes of the suffering is in my

30:21.900 --> 30:23.660
 family or the people that are lost.

30:24.780 --> 30:28.380
 I don't know because Hitler wrote all about it in Mein Kampf.

30:28.380 --> 30:32.140
 So I don't know if the evil he committed was there all along.

30:32.780 --> 30:36.780
 I mean, and that's where the question of forgiveness, I mean,

30:36.780 --> 30:39.420
 Hitler is such a difficult person to talk about, but it's

30:39.420 --> 30:46.380
 the question of cancer culture, who is deserving of forgiveness

30:46.380 --> 30:50.940
 and who is not like the Holocaust survivors that I've read

30:50.940 --> 30:52.620
 about that I've heard the interviews with.

30:53.340 --> 30:58.300
 They've often spoken about the fact that the way for them

30:58.300 --> 31:05.020
 to let go, to overcome the atrocities that they've experienced

31:05.020 --> 31:05.900
 is to forgive.

31:05.900 --> 31:09.420
 Like forgiveness is the way out for them.

31:09.980 --> 31:11.340
 It's interesting to think about.

31:11.340 --> 31:15.820
 I don't know if we're even as a society ready to even

31:15.820 --> 31:18.300
 contemplate an idea of forgiveness for Hitler.

31:19.180 --> 31:20.780
 It's an interesting idea though.

31:21.500 --> 31:26.140
 It's a good thought exercise at the very least to think about

31:26.140 --> 31:31.740
 like all these people that are being canceled for doing bad

31:31.740 --> 31:33.100
 things of different degrees.

31:33.100 --> 31:36.300
 Think of like Louis CK or somebody like that for being

31:36.300 --> 31:40.300
 not a good person, but like, what is the path for forgiveness?

31:40.300 --> 31:41.900
 And also what's a good person?

31:41.900 --> 31:43.020
 What is a good person?

31:43.020 --> 31:46.380
 If that's a sliding scale that we could all find ourselves

31:46.380 --> 31:49.580
 looking at the uncomfortable end of a gun on, you know,

31:49.580 --> 31:50.780
 particularly down the line.

31:50.780 --> 31:53.660
 I mean, you hope for the best, but these definitions, I guess,

31:53.660 --> 31:56.060
 like you said, are important and who's doing the canceling,

31:56.060 --> 31:57.100
 who's being canceled.

31:57.100 --> 32:00.300
 I'm not necessarily, as you said, saying that that's entirely

32:00.300 --> 32:03.340
 unjustified or certainly not, it's certainly understandable.

32:03.340 --> 32:05.820
 And particularly you mentioned like a monster, like an Adolf

32:05.820 --> 32:07.420
 Hitler, but it's also interesting.

32:07.420 --> 32:10.220
 I couldn't help but notice, like you mentioned as a society,

32:10.220 --> 32:13.100
 us being able to apply forgiveness to someone who's

32:13.100 --> 32:17.020
 done so much horror, but people who are personal, I mean,

32:17.020 --> 32:18.940
 of course, many of us, so many people in person affected,

32:18.940 --> 32:21.420
 but directly personally affected someone, a survivor of the

32:21.420 --> 32:24.060
 Holocaust being able to let go on that.

32:24.060 --> 32:27.020
 I'm nowhere near big enough a person for that sort of thing.

32:27.020 --> 32:31.340
 But I guess that's an interesting thing, you know, being

32:31.340 --> 32:35.820
 the person who was physically there, potentially able to

32:35.820 --> 32:39.660
 let go, I don't know, that's unbelievably powerful.

32:39.660 --> 32:40.300
 It's interesting.

32:40.300 --> 32:42.780
 I guess you have to wonder sometimes, and this isn't

32:42.780 --> 32:47.020
 obviously in regards to the Holocaust, but why I'm holding

32:47.020 --> 32:50.300
 on to various things, have I, what is it doing for me and

32:50.300 --> 32:51.660
 what is it doing to me?

32:51.660 --> 32:53.500
 Is it facilitative, is it not?

32:53.500 --> 32:55.980
 And I guess that's something else that I really want to

32:55.980 --> 32:57.980
 talk about, something else that I really enjoy.

32:57.980 --> 33:01.580
 When I was on Ultimate Fighter, they don't let you have any

33:01.580 --> 33:02.460
 music or any books.

33:02.460 --> 33:04.220
 I didn't have religious texts, so I brought a Bible and I

33:04.220 --> 33:06.940
 brought a Quran and I started to read them side by side.

33:06.940 --> 33:08.780
 And it was really interesting reading.

33:08.780 --> 33:11.260
 The Bible's a little drier, the Quran's more interesting,

33:11.260 --> 33:11.900
 at least written.

33:11.900 --> 33:17.900
 But I think something that was consistently brought up was

33:17.900 --> 33:20.220
 the way, most merciful.

33:20.220 --> 33:22.700
 People want, I don't think any of us want justice.

33:22.700 --> 33:25.500
 We think we want justice, but I don't think we want justice.

33:25.500 --> 33:28.700
 This is a dangerous, dangerous, dangerous game, because maybe

33:28.700 --> 33:31.180
 this person's wronged me deeply and I want justice.

33:31.180 --> 33:32.940
 I want to balance it out, because what is justice if not

33:32.940 --> 33:34.300
 a balancing of the scales?

33:34.300 --> 33:36.060
 And sometimes you can understand it on a societal

33:36.060 --> 33:36.940
 level, I think it's fine.

33:36.940 --> 33:39.500
 I mean, there's crime and punishment and we can go for

33:39.500 --> 33:41.100
 the benefits and the drawbacks of that.

33:41.100 --> 33:46.300
 But I think what any of us want is mercy within reason, grace,

33:46.300 --> 33:48.860
 as you mentioned, because justice is a very, very, very

33:48.860 --> 33:51.660
 dangerous thing and it's a valuable and important thing.

33:51.660 --> 33:55.020
 But who gets to decide what's just, what justice is actually

33:55.020 --> 33:55.500
 meted out?

33:55.500 --> 33:57.980
 Maybe I get to meet out justice, but it's not, I don't get

33:57.980 --> 33:58.620
 my comeuppance.

33:58.620 --> 34:00.940
 Well, that sounds great, but what happens when it's pointed

34:00.940 --> 34:01.420
 back at me?

34:02.060 --> 34:05.740
 And I guess that comes back to the veil of ignorance, the

34:05.740 --> 34:08.620
 idea that one day I will have to live in the world in which

34:08.620 --> 34:10.620
 I've envisioned and the world in which I've created.

34:11.500 --> 34:15.580
 I think that a lot of times people love the idea of they're

34:15.580 --> 34:18.220
 a judge for your crimes and a lawyer for theirs.

34:18.220 --> 34:19.420
 And I heard that the other day.

34:19.420 --> 34:20.620
 I thought that was great.

34:20.620 --> 34:23.980
 And I think that's a dangerous thing and hopefully it gives

34:23.980 --> 34:27.820
 us all pause before rightly or wrongly, but always understandably

34:29.180 --> 34:30.940
 wielding serious power.

34:30.940 --> 34:31.180
 Yeah.

34:31.180 --> 34:32.620
 Justice is a kind of drug.

34:32.620 --> 34:35.500
 So if you look at history, I've also been reading a lot

34:35.500 --> 34:36.460
 about Stalin.

34:36.460 --> 34:42.540
 I mean, all those folks really, I don't know what was inside

34:42.540 --> 34:45.500
 Hitler's head actually that he's a tricky one because I think

34:45.500 --> 34:47.020
 he was legitimately insane.

34:47.660 --> 34:48.700
 Stalin was not.

34:48.700 --> 34:53.500
 And Stalin was like, he literally thought he's doing a good

34:53.500 --> 34:53.980
 thing.

34:54.540 --> 34:59.180
 He literally thought for the entirety of the time that communism

34:59.180 --> 35:02.860
 is going to bring, like that's the utopia and he's going to

35:03.580 --> 35:05.020
 create a happy world.

35:05.500 --> 35:13.020
 And in his, in his mind were ideas of justice, of fairness,

35:13.020 --> 35:19.420
 of happiness, of, of yeah, human flourishing.

35:19.420 --> 35:23.820
 And that's, that's a drug and it's somehow sadly pollutes the

35:23.820 --> 35:26.220
 mind when you start thinking like that, what's good for

35:26.220 --> 35:30.860
 society and believing that you have a good sense of what's

35:30.860 --> 35:31.740
 good for society.

35:32.700 --> 35:35.580
 That's intoxicating, especially when others around you are

35:35.580 --> 35:36.780
 feeling the same way.

35:36.780 --> 35:40.220
 And then you start like building up this movement and you

35:40.220 --> 35:45.180
 forget that you are just like, you're, you're like barely

35:45.180 --> 35:46.860
 recently evolved from an ape.

35:46.860 --> 35:48.940
 Like you don't know what the hell you're doing.

35:48.940 --> 35:51.260
 And then you start like killing witches or whatever.

35:51.260 --> 35:52.700
 Like you start, you start doing.

35:52.700 --> 35:53.420
 They did math.

35:53.420 --> 35:54.220
 Let's be honest though.

35:54.220 --> 35:55.740
 I mean, sometimes you got a witch has to go.

35:56.620 --> 35:56.780
 Yeah.

35:56.780 --> 36:00.300
 We can all agree that a witch, a witch has to go if, if it

36:00.300 --> 36:02.860
 floats or sinks, which one, I forget which one.

36:02.860 --> 36:04.460
 Whichever one we need at the time, honestly.

36:04.460 --> 36:05.020
 Is it floating?

36:05.020 --> 36:05.580
 It should have sunk.

36:07.740 --> 36:09.980
 Yeah, but yeah, we can definitely agree that witches

36:09.980 --> 36:13.420
 have to go because you brought it up.

36:13.420 --> 36:18.540
 I tweeted recently, but also just, I'm one of the things

36:18.540 --> 36:22.540
 I'm really ashamed of in my life is I haven't really read

36:22.540 --> 36:24.780
 almost any of the sci fi classics.

36:24.780 --> 36:25.100
 Really?

36:25.660 --> 36:25.900
 Yeah.

36:25.900 --> 36:28.780
 So like I, my whole journey through reading was through

36:29.500 --> 36:35.500
 like the literary philosophers that would say like Camus,

36:35.500 --> 36:41.100
 Hase, Dostoevsky, Kafka, like that place, like that's a kind

36:41.100 --> 36:47.980
 of sci fi world in itself, but it's, it just, it creates a

36:47.980 --> 36:53.340
 world in which the, the deepest questions about human nature

36:53.340 --> 36:54.220
 can be explored.

36:55.580 --> 37:00.140
 I didn't realize this, but the sci fi world is the same.

37:00.140 --> 37:03.740
 It just puts it in a, it like removes it from any kind of

37:03.740 --> 37:07.020
 historical context where you can explore those same ideas

37:07.020 --> 37:09.500
 in like space somewhere elsewhere in a different time,

37:09.500 --> 37:10.540
 a different place.

37:10.540 --> 37:13.740
 It allows you almost like more freedom to like construct

37:13.740 --> 37:17.980
 these artificial things where you can just do crazy, crazy

37:17.980 --> 37:19.100
 kind of human experiments.

37:19.100 --> 37:21.980
 So I'm now working through it.

37:21.980 --> 37:25.980
 The books on my list are the foundation series by

37:25.980 --> 37:32.940
 Isaac Asimov, Dune, Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson and

37:32.940 --> 37:34.060
 Ender's Game, like you mentioned.

37:34.940 --> 37:37.580
 That's just kind of, and then, so I posted that.

37:37.580 --> 37:41.820
 And then of course, like Elon Musk, John Carmack, I don't

37:41.820 --> 37:43.740
 know if you know him, creator of Doom and Quake.

37:43.740 --> 37:44.140
 Oh, cool.

37:44.700 --> 37:47.660
 See, they all pitched in these nerds, these ultra nerds

37:47.660 --> 37:52.060
 just started like going like these, you need to read this,

37:52.060 --> 37:53.340
 that and the other.

37:53.340 --> 37:55.660
 So I've like started working out.

37:55.660 --> 37:56.160
 Okay.

37:56.460 --> 38:00.220
 But it seems like the list I've mentioned holds up somewhat.

38:00.220 --> 38:01.660
 Is there a book?

38:01.660 --> 38:10.060
 Is there sci fi books or series or authors that you find

38:10.060 --> 38:11.260
 are just amazing?

38:11.260 --> 38:13.820
 Maybe another way to ask that is like, what's the greatest

38:13.820 --> 38:15.260
 sci fi book of all time?

38:15.260 --> 38:18.540
 Well, I'd like to start by sharing something that I'm

38:18.540 --> 38:21.820
 embarrassed about is that I haven't read anything other

38:21.820 --> 38:26.620
 than, you know, Orson Scott Card, J.R. Tolkien,

38:26.620 --> 38:28.140
 Frank Herbert Tolkien.

38:28.140 --> 38:33.980
 Yeah, I'm aware through Wikipedia and through surface

38:33.980 --> 38:36.060
 reading of things that like a book called the Republic

38:36.060 --> 38:36.780
 was written once.

38:38.540 --> 38:39.100
 There were some other...

38:39.100 --> 38:40.780
 Do you read Wikipedia?

38:40.780 --> 38:43.740
 You're a prolific reader of Wikipedia articles.

38:43.740 --> 38:45.020
 Well, or occasional.

38:45.020 --> 38:46.460
 Occasional reader.

38:46.460 --> 38:47.020
 Exactly.

38:47.020 --> 38:50.060
 In between whatever else it is that I waste my time on.

38:50.060 --> 38:53.900
 But yeah, so I also, I should say, I posted on Reddit

38:53.900 --> 38:57.500
 questions for Ryan Hall and there's like a million

38:57.500 --> 39:01.020
 questions, but like half of them have to do with Dune.

39:01.020 --> 39:01.660
 No, not really.

39:01.660 --> 39:03.340
 But like people bring up Dune.

39:03.340 --> 39:04.300
 I don't understand why.

39:05.100 --> 39:06.700
 Did you mention Dune before?

39:06.700 --> 39:08.380
 Well, actually, we actually have a showy role actually

39:08.380 --> 39:11.660
 made us a Gi, a Dune themed Gi one time, which I thought

39:11.660 --> 39:12.460
 was kind of cool.

39:12.460 --> 39:12.860
 I'll send you.

39:12.860 --> 39:13.260
 I'll give you one.

39:13.260 --> 39:14.220
 We got extra stuff.

39:14.220 --> 39:17.900
 But actually, to your point, actually, this is Orson Scott

39:17.900 --> 39:19.820
 Card quote, actually the writer of Ender's Game.

39:20.620 --> 39:22.460
 Fiction, because it's not about somebody who actually

39:22.460 --> 39:25.340
 lived in the real world always has the possibility of being

39:25.340 --> 39:26.140
 about oneself.

39:26.140 --> 39:29.900
 And I think that's a neat thing because I have heard other

39:30.700 --> 39:33.260
 people whom I respect and very sharp people actually every

39:33.260 --> 39:35.340
 now and then dig their heels and going, I don't like fiction.

39:35.340 --> 39:36.220
 I only like nonfiction.

39:36.220 --> 39:37.500
 It's more instructive.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.740
 And I would go, I completely disagree with that.

39:39.740 --> 39:41.980
 I think we have a hard enough time figuring out what happened

39:41.980 --> 39:45.580
 at 711 three hours ago that, let me tell you what happened

39:45.580 --> 39:47.180
 600 years BC.

39:47.180 --> 39:48.220
 I'm like, hey, I'm interested.

39:48.220 --> 39:49.820
 But don't tell me this isn't a story too.

39:49.820 --> 39:50.300
 Yeah.

39:50.300 --> 39:54.060
 There's factual components, I have no doubt.

39:54.060 --> 39:57.500
 But we struggle sometimes to like, I guess what I like

39:57.500 --> 40:00.300
 about fiction is that you can tell me a story.

40:00.300 --> 40:01.580
 It's all about people.

40:01.580 --> 40:04.460
 I mean, every now there's more and less believable things.

40:04.460 --> 40:06.860
 And I think Dune would be an unbelievably well written,

40:06.860 --> 40:09.100
 in my opinion, for to run, what do I know?

40:09.100 --> 40:12.220
 But I really liked doing, I'll say that well written example

40:12.220 --> 40:15.900
 of human beings interacting with one another, the political

40:15.900 --> 40:18.780
 component to that, the emotional, the intellectual, the

40:18.780 --> 40:20.300
 relationship components, all of that.

40:20.300 --> 40:23.660
 And I think that Dune is neat because it's a sci fi, not

40:23.660 --> 40:26.620
 a sci fi novel, but only in the only in the loosest sense.

40:26.620 --> 40:31.260
 It's really a story about religion, about group dynamics,

40:31.260 --> 40:37.340
 about human potential, about belief, learning, politics,

40:38.460 --> 40:40.300
 governance, ecology.

40:40.300 --> 40:44.460
 It's the best stories remind me of history the same way

40:44.460 --> 40:48.220
 history hopefully is not just a list of facts that I try to be

40:48.220 --> 40:52.860
 able to recall or factoids that I try to recall, but a story

40:52.860 --> 40:57.340
 that I can understand and see how the threads of time kind

40:57.340 --> 40:59.340
 of came together and created certain things.

40:59.340 --> 41:01.500
 And a lot of times, like we say, I'm like, how the heck is

41:01.500 --> 41:04.060
 what's going on right now or 100 years from now or 100 years

41:04.060 --> 41:04.940
 in the past happened.

41:04.940 --> 41:06.300
 And you can look back far enough.

41:06.300 --> 41:09.820
 If we had accurate knowledge, if we had that hypothetical

41:09.820 --> 41:13.100
 perfect pool shot at the beginning of time, we would see

41:13.100 --> 41:16.780
 an unbroken chain of events that led us to where we are and

41:16.780 --> 41:18.780
 where we are will potentially lead us to where we're going,

41:18.780 --> 41:20.140
 which is, again, why hindsight is helpful.

41:20.140 --> 41:20.860
 But I think it's neat.

41:20.860 --> 41:23.660
 Like, I guess I really enjoy, for instance, a book like

41:23.660 --> 41:25.820
 Dune, and they're actually making a movie out of it, which

41:25.820 --> 41:28.940
 I'm skeptical of, to be honest, because it's going to be

41:28.940 --> 41:31.340
 difficult to bring that to the screen for a variety of

41:31.340 --> 41:33.660
 reasons, but there's at least a hundred questions.

41:33.660 --> 41:36.460
 Ask Ryan, what do you think about the new Dune movie?

41:36.460 --> 41:39.020
 I am not enough of an authority to have any sort of decent

41:39.020 --> 41:40.700
 opinion, but I guess what I would say is so much of it

41:40.700 --> 41:41.820
 goes on in the character's mind.

41:41.820 --> 41:45.580
 Like how much of any of our days is any lived experience,

41:45.580 --> 41:49.100
 as it were, is internal, but the majority, how many times

41:49.100 --> 41:52.060
 are people walking around and, you know, they're like, hey,

41:52.060 --> 41:52.700
 what do you see right now?

41:52.700 --> 41:54.300
 I'm like, oh, well, I see this picture.

41:54.300 --> 41:54.780
 I see a wall.

41:54.780 --> 41:55.660
 Hey, there's Lex.

41:55.660 --> 41:58.620
 But really what I was paying attention to was what was

41:58.620 --> 42:00.940
 going on inside of my head for a moment, and almost the rest

42:00.940 --> 42:03.580
 of the world tuned out and kind of dimmed.

42:03.580 --> 42:09.180
 And I guess I think that's going to be a struggle to any

42:09.180 --> 42:12.940
 time you want to bring that type of a written story to a

42:12.940 --> 42:13.740
 visual medium.

42:13.740 --> 42:16.140
 I think it's going to be more difficult, but it'll be

42:16.140 --> 42:16.620
 interesting.

42:16.620 --> 42:19.500
 It's definitely one of my favorite stories, and it's

42:20.620 --> 42:23.020
 honestly helped me become better at life, in my opinion,

42:23.020 --> 42:24.220
 better at martial arts.

42:24.220 --> 42:26.700
 And I think the writer, I think Frank Herbert was absolutely

42:26.700 --> 42:28.780
 brilliant, whether those were all his ideas, which are not

42:28.780 --> 42:29.260
 reality.

42:29.260 --> 42:31.660
 None of us or all of our good ideas aren't ours.

42:31.660 --> 42:32.300
 We're a combination.

42:32.300 --> 42:34.060
 Maybe it came up with something you're a curator of other

42:34.060 --> 42:36.140
 good ideas and some things you borrowed from somewhere

42:36.140 --> 42:37.500
 without even realizing it.

42:37.500 --> 42:40.940
 But I think the way the messages and the themes and the

42:40.940 --> 42:43.100
 ideas that were conveyed, particularly in the original

42:43.100 --> 42:45.420
 novel, are just absolutely brilliant.

42:45.420 --> 42:50.940
 Is that to you one of the greats and the flip side of

42:50.940 --> 42:54.780
 that, or another way to ask that is if somebody is new to

42:54.780 --> 42:57.740
 sci fi, is that something you would recommend that is an

42:57.740 --> 42:58.460
 entry point?

42:58.460 --> 43:00.380
 I'm not well read enough in the sci fi world.

43:00.380 --> 43:02.860
 I haven't read a lot of Isaac Asimov or anything like that,

43:02.860 --> 43:04.940
 but I'll recommend Dune.

43:04.940 --> 43:07.900
 I'll be an obnoxious evangelist for Dune to anyone who'll

43:07.900 --> 43:08.140
 listen.

43:08.700 --> 43:10.380
 So yeah, I would strongly recommend it.

43:10.380 --> 43:13.180
 So the other thing you mentioned, now I should

43:13.180 --> 43:15.340
 probably be talking to you about much more important

43:15.340 --> 43:18.620
 things, but the other thing is Skyrim.

43:19.740 --> 43:21.260
 Do you play video games?

43:21.260 --> 43:22.540
 What's your favorite game?

43:22.540 --> 43:24.860
 What's what would you say is the greatest video game of

43:24.860 --> 43:25.180
 all time?

43:25.180 --> 43:26.780
 Because I'm a huge fan of Elder Scrolls.

43:26.780 --> 43:27.820
 Oh, yeah.

43:27.820 --> 43:30.620
 I mean, I play a little bit at this point.

43:30.620 --> 43:33.980
 You know, a little less finally moves into a new house.

43:33.980 --> 43:35.580
 So you're like an adult.

43:35.580 --> 43:36.700
 No, no, no, no.

43:36.700 --> 43:38.220
 I'm like a better funded 12 year old.

43:39.500 --> 43:43.180
 Yeah, that's yeah, that's entirely that's entirely

43:43.180 --> 43:43.420
 accurate.

43:43.420 --> 43:44.940
 Better funded 12 year old.

43:44.940 --> 43:47.660
 But somewhat better funded 12 year old.

43:47.660 --> 43:48.780
 Not as well funded as I wish.

43:48.780 --> 43:50.620
 But historically, did you play video games?

43:50.620 --> 43:51.660
 Oh, yeah, I played as a kid.

43:51.660 --> 43:53.900
 I was, you know, again, I've always liked playing sports

43:53.900 --> 43:56.460
 and liked reading and I always enjoyed video games.

43:56.460 --> 43:59.100
 But my favorite video game I think I've ever played was

43:59.100 --> 44:00.220
 Knights of the Old Republic.

44:00.860 --> 44:01.740
 It was a Star Wars game.

44:01.740 --> 44:05.500
 A huge Star Wars fan until it become less so recently.

44:06.140 --> 44:06.540
 Disney.

44:07.660 --> 44:09.580
 You don't like the, I haven't watched it yet.

44:09.580 --> 44:11.020
 Oh, Mandalorian.

44:11.020 --> 44:11.740
 Oh, don't go there.

44:11.740 --> 44:13.180
 Oh, actually, I like Mandalorian.

44:13.180 --> 44:14.060
 That was actually pretty cool.

44:14.060 --> 44:15.420
 Yeah, waving this off.

44:15.420 --> 44:17.340
 Yeah, yeah, I will.

44:17.340 --> 44:20.140
 If I could cancel one thing, I would cancel Disney Star Wars.

44:20.140 --> 44:21.260
 I'm going to edit that part out.

44:21.260 --> 44:22.380
 Okay, let's go to the next.

44:23.260 --> 44:26.300
 But this is where if people are wondering if you're watching

44:26.300 --> 44:29.980
 this on YouTube and like the dislike amount is like 80%

44:29.980 --> 44:31.500
 it's because of that comment.

44:31.500 --> 44:32.860
 So good job.

44:32.860 --> 44:34.700
 Good job for making the internet hate you.

44:34.700 --> 44:35.740
 I regret nothing.

44:35.740 --> 44:38.140
 Now, what about Baby Yoda?

44:39.020 --> 44:41.340
 Yeah, I guess he's like little.

44:41.340 --> 44:43.820
 He's got ears and he uses the force sometimes and he passes

44:43.820 --> 44:44.300
 out again.

44:44.300 --> 44:45.900
 No qualms with Baby Yoda.

44:45.900 --> 44:47.100
 Yeah, you don't have a heart.

44:47.100 --> 44:52.220
 Okay, let's go to Jiu Jitsu if it's okay.

44:54.460 --> 44:58.540
 So the audience of this podcast may not know much about Jiu Jitsu

44:59.420 --> 45:01.820
 or they do because it's really part of the culture now,

45:01.820 --> 45:03.340
 but they don't really know much.

45:04.540 --> 45:07.180
 They see that so many people have fallen in love with it,

45:07.180 --> 45:09.020
 have been transformed through it, but they don't know much

45:09.020 --> 45:10.620
 about like, what is this thing?

45:10.620 --> 45:14.780
 Is there a way you could sort of try to explain what is

45:14.780 --> 45:17.660
 Jiu Jitsu, what is the essence of this martial art that's

45:17.660 --> 45:22.060
 captured the minds and hearts of so many people in the world?

45:22.060 --> 45:27.100
 I think that Jiu Jitsu is a philosophy that's expressed

45:27.100 --> 45:31.900
 physically and that it's the kind of development of the

45:32.460 --> 45:38.220
 mental capacity and physical capacity working in unison to

45:38.220 --> 45:45.420
 move efficiently and almost flowingly, unresistingly with

45:45.420 --> 45:49.340
 a given situation, with a physically resisting opponent.

45:50.380 --> 45:53.980
 Learning how to generate force on your own and how to steal

45:53.980 --> 45:56.220
 force from the floor, how to steal force from the other

45:56.220 --> 45:59.340
 person and move in concert with it as opposed to clash

45:59.340 --> 46:01.980
 against, which if you watch two untrained people fight,

46:01.980 --> 46:03.340
 it's almost entirely a clash.

46:03.340 --> 46:05.500
 It's a runaway and clash, a runaway and clash.

46:05.500 --> 46:10.300
 If you watch Jiu Jitsu done well, it looks like water

46:10.300 --> 46:12.540
 moving around a solid structure.

46:12.540 --> 46:15.580
 And I think that that is expressed physically.

46:15.580 --> 46:19.020
 And I think that all of the things that anyone has really

46:19.020 --> 46:22.540
 been able to do very, very well in Jiu Jitsu end up kind

46:22.540 --> 46:24.060
 of exemplifying that.

46:24.060 --> 46:26.300
 But I think that's true of martial arts in general.

46:26.300 --> 46:28.700
 I think that a lot of times like the clashing that we see

46:28.700 --> 46:33.020
 going on and working well is just the fact that it's

46:33.020 --> 46:35.660
 you know, you get very, very physically powerful people

46:35.660 --> 46:37.660
 every now and then they're able to get away with this.

46:37.660 --> 46:39.900
 But I don't think that that's, and that's fantastic

46:39.900 --> 46:41.660
 because ultimately it's a results driven thing.

46:41.660 --> 46:44.220
 But I think that the essence of the martial arts is learning

46:44.220 --> 46:46.300
 how to make more out of less and how to move with

46:46.300 --> 46:49.580
 and be yielding, almost like real life Aikido.

46:49.580 --> 46:53.580
 And so you think of martial arts, Jiu Jitsu as like water

46:57.100 --> 47:01.100
 or flowing, so Aikido, so moving around a solid structure

47:01.100 --> 47:06.100
 so Aikido, so moving around the force as opposed to sort of

47:08.940 --> 47:12.620
 maybe the wrestling mindset is finding a leverage

47:12.620 --> 47:15.100
 where you can apply an exceptional amount of force.

47:15.100 --> 47:18.540
 So like, so like maximizing the application of force.

47:18.540 --> 47:20.540
 I guess maybe that's a better way to, I'd like to marry

47:20.540 --> 47:22.940
 the two ideas, you know, because I think you flow

47:22.940 --> 47:25.020
 until the point at which you are the greater force

47:25.020 --> 47:27.180
 at which point in time you can apply.

47:27.180 --> 47:29.980
 But if you look at the best wrestlers and then when I say

47:29.980 --> 47:31.580
 best, I don't necessarily mean most successful

47:31.580 --> 47:33.900
 although of course most successful are always very

47:33.900 --> 47:37.500
 very good throughout the course of history in boxing

47:37.500 --> 47:41.820
 in wrestling, in Judo, they're magical.

47:41.820 --> 47:43.500
 They disappear and reappear.

47:43.500 --> 47:46.540
 It's like fighting a ghost that is like incorporeal

47:46.540 --> 47:47.500
 when you want to find it.

47:47.500 --> 47:49.580
 But then when you don't want it to find it

47:49.580 --> 47:51.580
 when you don't want to find it, it finds you.

47:51.580 --> 47:54.780
 And I think that we see that in the like the Bufais

47:54.780 --> 47:56.380
 or societies of wrestling.

47:56.380 --> 47:59.580
 And you know, I guess you could look at a Floyd Mayweather

47:59.580 --> 48:03.580
 or Willie Pep or you know, Prunell Whitaker in boxing

48:03.580 --> 48:07.740
 as brilliant examples of disappearing and reappearing.

48:07.740 --> 48:10.780
 And when you're strong, it's almost like guerrilla warfare.

48:10.780 --> 48:12.860
 When you're strong, I'm nowhere to be found.

48:12.860 --> 48:14.940
 When you're weak, you can't get rid of me.

48:14.940 --> 48:16.220
 And I think that's what we're looking for.

48:16.220 --> 48:18.300
 Yes, the TF brothers are incredible at that.

48:18.300 --> 48:23.100
 They just, they look like skinny Starbucks baristas

48:23.100 --> 48:28.100
 and they just manhandle everybody like effortlessly.

48:29.900 --> 48:31.820
 They look like they just kind of woke up,

48:31.820 --> 48:35.820
 rolled out of bed, fighting for like the gold medal

48:35.820 --> 48:38.540
 at the Olympics and just effortlessly throw,

48:39.900 --> 48:42.700
 like there's a match against, I guess, Yul Romero.

48:43.820 --> 48:46.140
 Yeah, so like, you know, if you look at like

48:46.140 --> 48:49.180
 who is the guy who's like intimidating in this case

48:49.180 --> 48:53.500
 and terrifying looking, it's Yul Romero,

48:53.500 --> 48:55.980
 just like a physical specimen

48:55.980 --> 48:58.220
 and obviously like a super accomplished wrestler.

48:58.220 --> 49:00.540
 I think this is for the gold medal, yeah.

49:00.540 --> 49:02.300
 In 2000.

49:02.300 --> 49:03.140
 In 2000?

49:03.140 --> 49:03.980
 Yeah, Sydney.

49:03.980 --> 49:06.580
 And then there, this is the year you all took silver.

49:08.460 --> 49:12.060
 And what you, like, just to show you like

49:12.060 --> 49:15.100
 there's a inside trip, effortless.

49:15.100 --> 49:17.020
 Uchi, and he does it again.

49:17.020 --> 49:22.020
 Yep, you know, it's a really creative kind of wrestling

49:22.260 --> 49:23.980
 where it's organic.

49:23.980 --> 49:26.300
 Yeah, you throw in all of these kinds of things.

49:26.300 --> 49:31.300
 This is a mix of judo, a mix of like weird kind of moves.

49:31.340 --> 49:34.620
 It's not like as funky as Ben Askren.

49:34.620 --> 49:39.020
 It's just like legitimate, basic.

49:39.020 --> 49:40.700
 Well, it's not funky for funky sake.

49:40.700 --> 49:42.660
 And I'm not poking at Ben Askren to imply

49:42.660 --> 49:45.020
 that that's what he's doing, but it's like, it's funny.

49:45.020 --> 49:47.220
 It's like, a lot of times it's almost like Musashi

49:47.220 --> 49:48.460
 talked a lot about that.

49:48.460 --> 49:51.180
 You know, that the only goal of combat is to win

49:51.180 --> 49:53.460
 is the outcome is it's outcome driven

49:53.460 --> 49:56.660
 versus like flourishing, you know, cool looking movements.

49:56.660 --> 49:58.820
 It's like, unless that had a utilitarian purpose,

49:58.820 --> 50:00.780
 like what are you wasting your time with that?

50:00.780 --> 50:03.780
 Both in the fight and also, you know, in practice.

50:03.780 --> 50:06.020
 But as you mentioned, it's almost like it looks like judo.

50:06.020 --> 50:07.540
 It looks like wrestling, it looks like jujitsu.

50:07.540 --> 50:09.780
 It's almost like, I guess the reminds me

50:09.780 --> 50:12.660
 all of the martial arts is again, deeply tribal as well.

50:12.660 --> 50:14.700
 I wanna learn Lex Fridman, martial arts.

50:14.700 --> 50:16.900
 And then I wanna learn another, you know,

50:16.900 --> 50:18.820
 I guess, transcendent person's martial arts.

50:18.820 --> 50:20.620
 And it just happened to be the set of movements

50:20.620 --> 50:22.620
 that you tended to do most of the time,

50:22.620 --> 50:25.060
 thanks to your body type and your opposition and whatnot.

50:25.060 --> 50:27.380
 But then I try to codify that and force those to work

50:27.380 --> 50:30.900
 as opposed to going, I wanna understand how the body works

50:30.900 --> 50:33.660
 in concert and in Congress with something else

50:33.660 --> 50:36.140
 and other forces and move appropriately.

50:36.140 --> 50:37.740
 And that's why it's like, it always struck me

50:37.740 --> 50:39.620
 that the Saiki brothers are great examples

50:39.620 --> 50:41.940
 of just moving like water, but they,

50:41.940 --> 50:43.820
 to use Bruce Lee, which is a little trite,

50:43.820 --> 50:44.660
 but again, he's brilliant.

50:44.660 --> 50:47.060
 It's like water can flow or water can crash.

50:47.060 --> 50:48.540
 And they would crash when they needed to crash

50:48.540 --> 50:49.780
 and they would flow when they needed to flow,

50:49.780 --> 50:51.820
 but they would flow for the purpose of dissipating

50:51.820 --> 50:53.580
 and then crash when they would win.

50:53.580 --> 50:55.580
 And at the right moment, then go back to flowing

50:55.580 --> 50:57.140
 the second that the other person found them.

50:57.140 --> 50:59.860
 And it's just, it's beautiful to watch, it's artistic.

50:59.860 --> 51:02.260
 And I think that that great expression of anything physical

51:02.260 --> 51:04.260
 is ultimately studied as a science,

51:04.260 --> 51:05.260
 but expressed as an art.

51:05.260 --> 51:06.700
 And I think that that's something that gets lost

51:06.700 --> 51:08.940
 in jujitsu a lot of times when it gets a little bit,

51:08.940 --> 51:10.860
 a little nerdy, like do this hand here, hand here.

51:10.860 --> 51:12.460
 Like it's like the more details I have,

51:12.460 --> 51:15.300
 the better when in reality, that's just not,

51:15.300 --> 51:17.860
 not in my experience, how it's done.

51:17.860 --> 51:21.260
 Might be fun exercise of saying like,

51:21.260 --> 51:25.700
 what are the main positions and submissions

51:25.700 --> 51:27.860
 in the art of jujitsu?

51:27.860 --> 51:30.380
 You don't have to be complete, that's a ridiculously,

51:30.380 --> 51:32.300
 I apologize for putting you on a spot like this,

51:32.300 --> 51:35.020
 but it might be a nice exercise to think through it.

51:35.020 --> 51:37.300
 Sure, I mean, I would just say that there,

51:37.300 --> 51:39.460
 you have your arms bend in various ways.

51:39.460 --> 51:41.820
 You have key lock Americana, straight arm locks,

51:41.820 --> 51:43.940
 Kimura, omoplata, omoplata is a Kimura,

51:43.940 --> 51:45.460
 Kimura is an omoplata, it's just executed.

51:45.460 --> 51:46.300
 Submissions.

51:46.300 --> 51:47.140
 Submissions, yes.

51:47.140 --> 51:49.580
 Breaking off your arm in all kinds of ways.

51:49.580 --> 51:51.460
 But ultimately, the question is,

51:51.460 --> 51:52.660
 let's say you were a Terminator,

51:52.660 --> 51:54.580
 like a robot that I, which of course you are.

51:54.580 --> 51:55.420
 Go on.

51:55.420 --> 51:56.260
 Go on.

51:56.260 --> 51:58.980
 It's like, all right, so we're being completely literal.

51:58.980 --> 52:02.060
 But, and I couldn't harm you with any of these things.

52:02.060 --> 52:03.580
 Would I still use these positions?

52:03.580 --> 52:04.420
 The answer is yes.

52:04.420 --> 52:06.620
 They create leverage, they create control,

52:06.620 --> 52:08.540
 they create shapes that I can affect

52:08.540 --> 52:10.700
 and that can affect me and they can be affected

52:10.700 --> 52:13.140
 through other forces and other objects or structures

52:13.140 --> 52:14.220
 like the ground or the wall.

52:14.220 --> 52:15.420
 I really enjoy mixed martial arts

52:15.420 --> 52:17.380
 because there's another component

52:17.380 --> 52:18.980
 rather than just me and you and the floor,

52:18.980 --> 52:20.600
 there's me, you, the floor, and the wall.

52:20.600 --> 52:21.940
 And it's another player in the game

52:21.940 --> 52:24.580
 that doesn't exist in a grappling context

52:24.580 --> 52:28.580
 with a non enclosed, I guess, area of combat.

52:28.580 --> 52:32.980
 But you can strangle me or choke me,

52:32.980 --> 52:35.940
 what do you call it, without my arms being involved,

52:35.940 --> 52:37.800
 or you can use one of my shoulders

52:37.800 --> 52:40.220
 to pin one side of my, one carotid artery off

52:40.220 --> 52:41.620
 and you can enclose the other.

52:41.620 --> 52:43.980
 You can turn my knee in the exact same ways

52:43.980 --> 52:47.460
 that you can turn my arm straight this way and that way.

52:47.460 --> 52:48.820
 You can add a rotation to that

52:48.820 --> 52:51.140
 or it can be directly linear against the joint.

52:51.140 --> 52:52.840
 So I guess what I would say is the more

52:52.840 --> 52:55.180
 that I've been able to understand jiu jitsu,

52:55.180 --> 52:58.300
 the more that I've been, it's given me a look

52:58.300 --> 53:01.260
 into how we learn language where rather

53:01.260 --> 53:03.260
 than learning five bazillion adjectives,

53:03.260 --> 53:05.260
 I go, I understand what an adjective is.

53:05.260 --> 53:06.260
 And of course we are all read

53:06.260 --> 53:09.100
 into some degree of vocabulary.

53:09.100 --> 53:11.220
 I understand what an adverb does

53:11.220 --> 53:12.980
 and I understand what an adverb is.

53:12.980 --> 53:13.900
 I know what a noun is.

53:13.900 --> 53:16.060
 I know what the component parts of a sentence are.

53:16.060 --> 53:18.220
 I know what, you know, I guess a clause,

53:18.220 --> 53:19.740
 a contraction, any of these things.

53:19.740 --> 53:23.220
 And it allows you to be interesting and artistic

53:23.220 --> 53:25.340
 with your language to the extent that you can.

53:25.340 --> 53:27.540
 But I can't, like I can speak a degree of Spanish,

53:27.540 --> 53:29.760
 but I'm not even slightly artistic in Spanish.

53:29.760 --> 53:32.780
 I would be something, I speak like a child

53:32.780 --> 53:33.740
 with a head injury.

53:33.740 --> 53:35.980
 And anyway, the I.

53:35.980 --> 53:38.220
 Your basic understanding of the English language

53:38.220 --> 53:40.540
 allows you to then be a student of Spanish.

53:40.540 --> 53:43.140
 100%, but I'm limited by my experience.

53:43.140 --> 53:45.620
 I'm limited by my understanding of techniques.

53:45.620 --> 53:47.620
 I'm limited by my understanding, almost like,

53:47.620 --> 53:51.060
 let's say techniques are like these are like vocabulary.

53:51.060 --> 53:54.220
 So even if I kind of sort of grasp the sentence structure

53:54.220 --> 53:56.660
 and the thought process and the thought patterns

53:56.660 --> 53:58.420
 of Spanish, which it's interesting

53:58.420 --> 54:00.580
 because just even though the orientation

54:00.580 --> 54:01.780
 and the organization of a language,

54:01.780 --> 54:03.780
 and I've thought about this a great deal,

54:03.780 --> 54:05.340
 you know, the way that I perceive the world

54:05.340 --> 54:07.820
 is affected deeply by the language that I learned.

54:07.820 --> 54:09.540
 The, you know, the, again, if I learned,

54:09.540 --> 54:11.740
 I have no idea how the Chinese language structures,

54:11.740 --> 54:13.520
 but I can only imagine that it would be,

54:13.520 --> 54:15.140
 that it would affect, it's like a different lens.

54:15.140 --> 54:16.380
 We're all looking at the same thing,

54:16.380 --> 54:19.540
 but I have a different set of sunglasses on than you do.

54:19.540 --> 54:21.980
 And that's very, very interesting.

54:21.980 --> 54:23.340
 I'll use the Quran as an example.

54:23.340 --> 54:25.500
 You know, apparently it's unbelievably poetic

54:25.500 --> 54:27.700
 and in Arabic, still neat

54:27.700 --> 54:29.540
 and was interesting reading in English,

54:29.540 --> 54:32.080
 but I'm told by people that I trust

54:32.080 --> 54:34.180
 that it just one doesn't bear a resemblance to the other.

54:34.180 --> 54:35.800
 And I think that's a very interesting thing

54:35.800 --> 54:37.940
 that you may be able to say the same thing,

54:37.940 --> 54:41.100
 but in a more, I guess, in a different way,

54:41.100 --> 54:43.900
 in a more artistic way that may not translate

54:43.900 --> 54:45.780
 on a one for one kind of fidelity.

54:45.780 --> 54:49.020
 But the more that we're able to understand

54:49.020 --> 54:50.300
 about how the body works,

54:50.300 --> 54:52.200
 the more examples of the body working this way,

54:52.200 --> 54:54.300
 the body working that way, the body working that way,

54:54.300 --> 54:56.340
 the more that I'm able to eventually become an artist,

54:56.340 --> 54:57.980
 but it has to be studied as a science first.

54:57.980 --> 54:59.700
 And it does start with technique collection,

54:59.700 --> 55:02.460
 vocabulary collection, the same way we learn in school.

55:02.460 --> 55:06.780
 You remember how to say quickly 17 different ways.

55:06.780 --> 55:10.420
 And let's say I speak Spanish, I'm only, I only know three.

55:10.420 --> 55:13.340
 So you might use quickly, you might use an adjective

55:13.340 --> 55:15.360
 like quickly in Spanish, but use one of the many,

55:15.360 --> 55:17.500
 many options to describe that, that I don't understand.

55:17.500 --> 55:20.020
 And now I sit there and go like, wait, what?

55:20.020 --> 55:21.220
 I can't be artistic.

55:21.220 --> 55:23.340
 I can't be as organic with the language as I'd like.

55:23.340 --> 55:25.200
 So I believe that jujitsu a lot of times starts

55:25.200 --> 55:28.420
 with the acquisition of a lot of, hey, do this, this,

55:28.420 --> 55:29.540
 this drill, this technique.

55:29.540 --> 55:31.460
 Here's an Americana, Americana to an armlock,

55:31.460 --> 55:33.380
 armlock to a triangle.

55:33.380 --> 55:35.740
 But the problem with that is oftentimes

55:35.740 --> 55:37.700
 we get stuck in that phase.

55:37.700 --> 55:40.740
 And people eventually become move collectors

55:40.740 --> 55:41.740
 or sequence collectors.

55:41.740 --> 55:43.660
 And I noticed this when I'm trying to do DVDs

55:43.660 --> 55:45.660
 or I guess like an instructional series now,

55:45.660 --> 55:47.180
 or even teaching in class,

55:47.180 --> 55:49.660
 I don't believe in that form of learning anymore.

55:49.660 --> 55:52.260
 Not that it's not valuable, but I don't believe,

55:52.260 --> 55:54.000
 I don't understand jujitsu on that level anymore.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.260
 So what I'm trying to do is get across the basic ideas

55:56.260 --> 55:59.220
 to people and say, hey, you need to fill in the gaps

55:59.220 --> 56:01.180
 with going to class all the time.

56:01.180 --> 56:03.220
 You need to go, hey, learn this move, learn that technique,

56:03.220 --> 56:04.060
 learn that technique.

56:04.060 --> 56:05.980
 Because otherwise I'm basically just throwing at you

56:05.980 --> 56:08.500
 like 75 different words that you could use,

56:08.500 --> 56:12.040
 but that hasn't really taught you how to speak a language.

56:12.040 --> 56:14.020
 Whereas if you give me a language structure,

56:14.020 --> 56:16.140
 you can fill in these pieces on your own

56:16.140 --> 56:19.020
 and then eventually speak organically in Lex form,

56:19.020 --> 56:20.820
 which will be ultimately unique to you

56:20.820 --> 56:24.060
 because otherwise you just end up being like a weird facsimile

56:24.060 --> 56:25.700
 of whatever it is that I'm doing

56:25.700 --> 56:29.140
 for mostly the worst I'd say, but.

56:29.140 --> 56:31.180
 Yeah, that's what people, I mean, people comment like,

56:31.180 --> 56:34.640
 is this, especially people who haven't listened to me before,

56:34.640 --> 56:37.140
 is this guy drunk or high?

56:37.140 --> 56:42.140
 Does he, does MIT really allow slow people to be,

56:42.980 --> 56:44.420
 like what's. Quotas.

56:44.420 --> 56:45.540
 Quotas, yeah.

56:45.540 --> 56:47.020
 Like what's wrong with him?

56:47.020 --> 56:48.020
 Is he getting sleep?

56:48.020 --> 56:49.140
 Are you okay?

56:49.140 --> 56:50.420
 Does he need help?

56:50.420 --> 56:52.300
 So that's similar with my jiu jitsu.

56:52.300 --> 56:54.900
 It's like, is this guy, is this guy really,

56:54.900 --> 56:57.180
 whatever rank I was throughout,

56:57.180 --> 57:01.020
 I remember just like, is this guy really this rank?

57:01.020 --> 57:03.520
 I just have a very kind of certain way of sitting

57:03.520 --> 57:06.340
 and being slow and lazy looking

57:06.340 --> 57:08.260
 that there was ultimately the language

57:08.260 --> 57:09.420
 that I had to discover.

57:09.420 --> 57:11.820
 And it was, it was, yeah,

57:11.820 --> 57:13.500
 it was a very liberating moment.

57:13.500 --> 57:18.500
 I think of probably a few years of getting my ass kicked,

57:19.500 --> 57:21.420
 especially with Open Guard and butterfly

57:21.420 --> 57:22.900
 to where you really allow yourself

57:22.900 --> 57:24.980
 to take in the entirety of the language

57:24.980 --> 57:29.140
 and realize that, that I'm not, I'm different.

57:29.140 --> 57:31.900
 I'm a unique, I'm unique.

57:31.900 --> 57:35.300
 And like, I have a very, I have a language,

57:35.300 --> 57:36.700
 I have a set of techniques,

57:36.700 --> 57:39.620
 a way I move my body that needs,

57:39.620 --> 57:41.300
 that I'm the one to discover.

57:41.300 --> 57:43.380
 Like it's, you can only,

57:43.380 --> 57:45.220
 you can learn specific techniques and so on,

57:45.220 --> 57:47.660
 but you really have to understand your own body.

57:47.660 --> 57:49.460
 And that's the beautiful thing about jiu jitsu,

57:49.460 --> 57:54.460
 like you said, is like the connection about your philosophy,

57:54.460 --> 57:57.100
 your view of the world with the physical

57:57.100 --> 57:59.260
 and like connecting those two things,

57:59.260 --> 58:00.940
 how you perceive the world,

58:00.940 --> 58:04.780
 how you interpret ideas of the world about exhaustion,

58:04.780 --> 58:07.560
 about force, about effortlessness,

58:07.560 --> 58:09.100
 like what it really means to relax,

58:09.100 --> 58:10.940
 all these kinds of loose concepts,

58:10.940 --> 58:15.940
 and then actually teach your body to like do those things

58:16.460 --> 58:20.020
 and like, you know, and be able to apply force and spurts,

58:20.020 --> 58:21.260
 be able to relax and spurts

58:21.260 --> 58:23.900
 and like figure all that stuff out for my,

58:23.900 --> 58:26.100
 for my individual body.

58:26.100 --> 58:27.340
 But it's, as you mentioned,

58:27.340 --> 58:29.340
 I couldn't agree with you more, it's a discovery process

58:29.340 --> 58:31.240
 and no one can cheat that process,

58:31.240 --> 58:32.460
 which is at the same time,

58:32.460 --> 58:34.260
 it's almost like imagine I wanna start writing books

58:34.260 --> 58:38.020
 in second grade, unless maybe I'm like staggeringly brilliant,

58:38.020 --> 58:40.280
 which I can only conceptualize someone being able to do that,

58:40.280 --> 58:42.360
 but maybe a Mozart of the English language

58:42.360 --> 58:43.760
 where you're out there doing it.

58:43.760 --> 58:45.980
 But for most of us, we don't have enough knowledge,

58:45.980 --> 58:47.500
 enough information, enough experience

58:47.500 --> 58:51.100
 to be able to be, to express ourselves.

58:51.100 --> 58:56.100
 So we have to basically input, repeat, which is important,

58:56.900 --> 58:58.140
 but it's the process, as you say,

58:58.140 --> 58:59.740
 of going through that, of getting your ass kicked,

58:59.740 --> 59:00.860
 of just like, well, that didn't work,

59:00.860 --> 59:02.080
 well, that didn't work, that felt right,

59:02.080 --> 59:03.220
 but I don't know, nobody else does that,

59:03.220 --> 59:04.520
 I guess I don't believe in that,

59:04.520 --> 59:06.580
 versus eventually going, I don't know,

59:06.580 --> 59:08.620
 I'll just try going my own way and see what happens

59:08.620 --> 59:10.440
 and now I'll get yelled at and people won't like me

59:10.440 --> 59:11.820
 and if it works, they'll say I got lucky

59:11.820 --> 59:13.740
 and if it doesn't work, they'll say I was dumb,

59:13.740 --> 59:15.460
 but which one, maybe all is right.

59:15.460 --> 59:17.420
 But basically, you know,

59:17.420 --> 59:19.340
 going through that iterative process

59:19.340 --> 59:21.900
 that allows you to eventually find your self expression

59:21.900 --> 59:24.020
 and find your voice so that you fight

59:24.020 --> 59:25.980
 the same way that you speak, the same way that you write,

59:25.980 --> 59:28.660
 the same way that you think in a way that is uniquely you,

59:28.660 --> 59:31.820
 that will also ultimately allow you

59:31.820 --> 59:33.780
 to understand other people being uniquely them

59:33.780 --> 59:35.660
 because even if you can only conceptualize,

59:35.660 --> 59:37.700
 and I think about this a lot for society stuff,

59:37.700 --> 59:39.700
 where I go, well, this is how I feel about this,

59:39.700 --> 59:41.540
 but am I objectively right?

59:41.540 --> 59:43.700
 Maybe about a couple things, but that's a small box

59:43.700 --> 59:45.060
 that I have to be very, very careful about

59:45.060 --> 59:47.340
 what I think is objective versus what's not

59:47.340 --> 59:48.780
 and I have to be open to the possibility

59:48.780 --> 59:50.900
 of all the things that I think are objectively correct

59:50.900 --> 59:52.100
 may or may not be.

59:52.100 --> 59:54.660
 And that should allow me to have some degree

59:54.660 --> 59:57.020
 of compassion or consideration for other people,

59:57.020 --> 59:58.300
 both in their martial arts journey

59:58.300 --> 1:00:01.820
 and in their journey as people, as human beings,

1:00:01.820 --> 1:00:04.620
 because I understand that they're on a,

1:00:04.620 --> 1:00:07.580
 it's a, we're all on a path where it's all,

1:00:07.580 --> 1:00:10.580
 again, an iterative process of eventual self expression,

1:00:10.580 --> 1:00:11.620
 but I think that's one of the things

1:00:11.620 --> 1:00:15.180
 that we see having trouble when we see tribalism,

1:00:15.180 --> 1:00:17.420
 which, I mean, racism, expression of that,

1:00:17.420 --> 1:00:19.260
 political affiliation, expression of that,

1:00:19.260 --> 1:00:20.500
 all of these things that can go

1:00:20.500 --> 1:00:21.980
 in really uncomfortable directions.

1:00:21.980 --> 1:00:23.380
 People are looking for,

1:00:23.380 --> 1:00:24.740
 hey, where do I plant my feet over here?

1:00:24.740 --> 1:00:26.860
 Where's the thing that I know is right?

1:00:26.860 --> 1:00:29.100
 And we can all agree on the following.

1:00:29.100 --> 1:00:31.180
 And I think that we see that in martial arts.

1:00:31.180 --> 1:00:33.140
 We're like, oh, I do this style, I do that style,

1:00:33.140 --> 1:00:33.980
 I do that style.

1:00:33.980 --> 1:00:35.820
 It's like, hey, man, we're all just pushing forward

1:00:35.820 --> 1:00:37.460
 in a certain direction here, trying to do our best.

1:00:37.460 --> 1:00:38.700
 And I understand why you feel the way you do.

1:00:38.700 --> 1:00:40.660
 I may have felt like that at one point too,

1:00:40.660 --> 1:00:44.300
 but I'm just trying to learn and understand

1:00:44.300 --> 1:00:47.140
 versus I've already acquired enough knowledge,

1:00:47.140 --> 1:00:49.180
 let me cross my arms and start to look

1:00:49.180 --> 1:00:50.700
 who's fucking up around here.

1:00:50.700 --> 1:00:55.060
 And I think that that's an, it's an interesting trap

1:00:55.060 --> 1:00:57.100
 that I think is very human trap to fall into,

1:00:57.100 --> 1:00:58.660
 but it definitely happens early on.

1:00:58.660 --> 1:01:00.340
 It's, I mean, it's a joke in the jiu jitsu world, right?

1:01:00.340 --> 1:01:02.180
 Like, oh, the blue belt that knows everything.

1:01:02.180 --> 1:01:03.780
 Well, initially it's like, what, I know nothing

1:01:03.780 --> 1:01:05.380
 and I at least think I know nothing.

1:01:05.380 --> 1:01:07.700
 Then I'd learn a little bit and I think it's a lot bit.

1:01:07.700 --> 1:01:09.020
 And then, you know, the more you learn,

1:01:09.020 --> 1:01:11.140
 the more you go like, I don't even know what I'm doing.

1:01:11.140 --> 1:01:13.020
 Yeah, that's exactly right.

1:01:13.020 --> 1:01:14.940
 We kind of talked about it a little bit,

1:01:14.940 --> 1:01:18.140
 but once again, a lot of people that listen to this

1:01:18.140 --> 1:01:20.820
 have never been on the mat, have never tried jiu jitsu,

1:01:20.820 --> 1:01:23.060
 but are really curious about it.

1:01:23.060 --> 1:01:25.740
 Everybody at all positions, like I think, you know,

1:01:25.740 --> 1:01:27.660
 most kids are not doing jiu jitsu.

1:01:27.660 --> 1:01:30.380
 Andrew Yang is like, they're all, you know,

1:01:30.380 --> 1:01:31.620
 the world is curious.

1:01:31.620 --> 1:01:36.020
 It's a, it's a nice, it seems to be a nice methodology

1:01:36.020 --> 1:01:38.060
 by which to humble your ego,

1:01:38.060 --> 1:01:39.980
 which to grow intellectually and physically.

1:01:39.980 --> 1:01:42.140
 So people are curious about it.

1:01:42.140 --> 1:01:44.900
 So the natural question is if they're curious about it,

1:01:44.900 --> 1:01:47.180
 how would you recommend they get started?

1:01:47.180 --> 1:01:51.140
 Maybe like, what do you recommend the first day,

1:01:51.140 --> 1:01:54.540
 week, month, year, first couple of years look like?

1:01:54.540 --> 1:01:56.300
 Like, how do you ease into it

1:01:56.300 --> 1:01:59.020
 and make sure that it's a positive experience

1:01:59.020 --> 1:02:03.460
 and you progress in the most optimal and positive way?

1:02:03.460 --> 1:02:07.020
 The first thing you can do is simply ask yourself why,

1:02:07.020 --> 1:02:08.220
 why you want to be involved.

1:02:08.220 --> 1:02:10.160
 You know, I remember the first day that I walked into

1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:12.260
 Ronin Athletics in New York City

1:02:12.260 --> 1:02:14.640
 to train under Godfather of my son now,

1:02:14.640 --> 1:02:18.020
 Christian Montes, and I didn't know

1:02:18.020 --> 1:02:19.220
 what I was getting myself into.

1:02:19.220 --> 1:02:21.120
 I played baseball through high school

1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:24.620
 and I wanted, I was at Manhattan College in the Bronx

1:02:24.620 --> 1:02:27.340
 and I wanted to go and learn martial arts

1:02:27.340 --> 1:02:29.540
 because it was always something that was interesting to me,

1:02:29.540 --> 1:02:33.080
 but it was never something that I knew was accessible

1:02:33.080 --> 1:02:34.900
 and it definitely wasn't really around

1:02:34.900 --> 1:02:36.740
 in Northern Virginia where I grew up,

1:02:36.740 --> 1:02:38.800
 whereas then you stick yourself in Manhattan

1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:40.080
 and there's stuff everywhere.

1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:43.260
 So anyway, I guess I didn't know what to expect.

1:02:43.260 --> 1:02:45.180
 I didn't know if I was going to get beat up,

1:02:45.180 --> 1:02:46.180
 if people were going to be nice,

1:02:46.180 --> 1:02:48.300
 if people were not going to be nice,

1:02:48.300 --> 1:02:52.940
 but what I began with was, I think, expectation management.

1:02:52.940 --> 1:02:56.860
 And I think that that's something that I would,

1:02:56.860 --> 1:02:58.500
 that'd be the first thing that I would start

1:02:58.500 --> 1:03:01.580
 is almost imagining what is it that I'm getting myself into

1:03:01.580 --> 1:03:03.860
 because I love the martial arts.

1:03:03.860 --> 1:03:05.440
 The martial arts has given me everything in life

1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:08.380
 and I'm so thankful I wouldn't be sitting here

1:03:08.380 --> 1:03:11.220
 without that experience, that journey.

1:03:11.220 --> 1:03:12.900
 The people that I've met, the places that I've gone,

1:03:12.900 --> 1:03:15.320
 I could never, ever have ever imagined.

1:03:17.060 --> 1:03:19.020
 And I'm just unbelievably thankful for that.

1:03:19.020 --> 1:03:24.020
 But I think that the thing that helped me most of all

1:03:24.700 --> 1:03:26.540
 was starting with going,

1:03:26.540 --> 1:03:29.300
 my mom said something to me one time and she said,

1:03:29.300 --> 1:03:31.700
 there's two types of people in various situations.

1:03:31.700 --> 1:03:33.440
 There's why and there's why not.

1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:36.100
 And it's understandable to have questions, concerns,

1:03:36.100 --> 1:03:37.660
 things like that.

1:03:37.660 --> 1:03:39.380
 But maybe sometimes it's a little bit easier

1:03:39.380 --> 1:03:41.960
 when you're younger to just trust people

1:03:41.960 --> 1:03:44.140
 or just say, I don't know, you know.

1:03:44.140 --> 1:03:46.620
 But we go, hey, you wanna climb that rock?

1:03:46.620 --> 1:03:47.440
 I'm like, yeah, why not?

1:03:47.440 --> 1:03:48.280
 Let's go.

1:03:48.280 --> 1:03:49.120
 Hey, you wanna jump in that river?

1:03:49.120 --> 1:03:49.960
 Yeah, why not?

1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:50.780
 Sure.

1:03:50.780 --> 1:03:53.180
 Versus if I have to reason my way into everything,

1:03:53.180 --> 1:03:55.060
 if I have to be talked into everything,

1:03:55.060 --> 1:03:56.740
 a lot of times I'll talk myself out of it.

1:03:56.740 --> 1:03:57.780
 And I think that a lot of times

1:03:57.780 --> 1:03:59.740
 this is the thinker's disease.

1:03:59.740 --> 1:04:01.480
 You wanna figure out what's gonna happen

1:04:01.480 --> 1:04:03.660
 and what you should expect to have happen

1:04:03.660 --> 1:04:06.460
 before you get involved versus going,

1:04:06.460 --> 1:04:08.060
 using the old Bruce Lee saying again,

1:04:08.060 --> 1:04:09.700
 it's like no amount of thinking or training

1:04:09.700 --> 1:04:12.300
 on the side of the river will teach you how to swim.

1:04:12.300 --> 1:04:13.620
 You have to jump in.

1:04:13.620 --> 1:04:15.400
 And there are risks associated with that.

1:04:15.400 --> 1:04:19.620
 And I guess psychological are usually the biggest ones.

1:04:19.620 --> 1:04:20.700
 That's the biggest hurdle.

1:04:20.700 --> 1:04:21.620
 And physical.

1:04:22.720 --> 1:04:25.160
 But the biggest thing that I guess I would suggest

1:04:25.160 --> 1:04:26.540
 to anyone to say, well, why do you wanna do this?

1:04:26.540 --> 1:04:28.180
 You're like, well, I wanna challenge myself.

1:04:28.180 --> 1:04:30.280
 I wanna learn, I would like to learn to fight.

1:04:30.280 --> 1:04:32.440
 I wanted to learn to fight so that I could protect myself.

1:04:32.440 --> 1:04:33.940
 And if anything else, other people,

1:04:33.940 --> 1:04:35.420
 if only within arms reach.

1:04:35.420 --> 1:04:39.980
 I perceived that if I had some small degree of power,

1:04:39.980 --> 1:04:41.460
 I generally wouldn't use it.

1:04:41.460 --> 1:04:42.860
 Which is why I was like, yeah, I'll give it a try.

1:04:42.860 --> 1:04:43.840
 I'll try to be reasonable.

1:04:43.840 --> 1:04:45.180
 And hopefully if I make a mistake,

1:04:45.180 --> 1:04:46.180
 I'll apologize to people.

1:04:46.180 --> 1:04:49.120
 But basically I said, yeah, I'd like to have that.

1:04:49.120 --> 1:04:52.180
 And I wanna, I know this is gonna be challenging

1:04:52.180 --> 1:04:54.100
 and we'll see what happens.

1:04:54.100 --> 1:04:55.620
 And that means that getting beat up

1:04:55.620 --> 1:04:57.780
 and I didn't get like hurt, but getting roughed up,

1:04:57.780 --> 1:05:00.520
 getting my arm bent this way or that way, getting choked.

1:05:00.520 --> 1:05:01.820
 I was like, well, this is all supposed to happen.

1:05:01.820 --> 1:05:02.940
 That's no big deal.

1:05:02.940 --> 1:05:04.740
 It would be like going and joining the army

1:05:04.740 --> 1:05:06.900
 during peacetime and then going,

1:05:06.900 --> 1:05:08.580
 oh, I'm just doing this for college education.

1:05:08.580 --> 1:05:09.820
 You know, like, okay, that's cool, man.

1:05:09.820 --> 1:05:11.560
 And then all of a sudden war breaks out

1:05:11.560 --> 1:05:12.500
 and they wanna send me somewhere.

1:05:12.500 --> 1:05:13.580
 And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:05:13.580 --> 1:05:15.020
 I didn't sign up for that.

1:05:15.020 --> 1:05:17.380
 Actually you did, whether you realize it or not.

1:05:17.380 --> 1:05:19.820
 You may not have thought that you did, but you did.

1:05:19.820 --> 1:05:22.880
 So getting your mind right and just going,

1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:24.580
 what are my expectations for this activity?

1:05:24.580 --> 1:05:25.940
 What is it that I'm looking to do?

1:05:25.940 --> 1:05:28.660
 And of course, you know, you're going into a gym,

1:05:28.660 --> 1:05:30.460
 you're going into a place that you don't know people,

1:05:30.460 --> 1:05:31.660
 you probably don't know people

1:05:31.660 --> 1:05:32.580
 and you don't know the coach.

1:05:32.580 --> 1:05:34.100
 And even if you do wanna, hey, how you doing?

1:05:34.100 --> 1:05:35.660
 Shake your hand, type of level.

1:05:35.660 --> 1:05:38.180
 You know, 95% of my students don't know me.

1:05:38.180 --> 1:05:39.540
 Not really, you know, I'll try to be polite

1:05:39.540 --> 1:05:40.580
 and not annoy them too much,

1:05:40.580 --> 1:05:43.100
 but they don't know me and I don't know them.

1:05:43.100 --> 1:05:45.260
 I understand if they don't trust me,

1:05:45.260 --> 1:05:48.140
 I wouldn't trust, trust me either if I were them.

1:05:48.140 --> 1:05:50.820
 But at the same time, someone has to take that leap.

1:05:50.820 --> 1:05:52.680
 And one of the things that I've noticed

1:05:52.680 --> 1:05:53.820
 as a martial arts instructor,

1:05:53.820 --> 1:05:56.940
 that's the biggest struggle with dealing with adults,

1:05:56.940 --> 1:05:58.660
 which is why a lot of people like to teach kids

1:05:58.660 --> 1:06:01.020
 is because kids don't ask, don't argue.

1:06:01.020 --> 1:06:04.060
 Now that also means there's all sorts of pitfalls

1:06:04.060 --> 1:06:05.860
 or that sort of thing, and that can be an issue.

1:06:05.860 --> 1:06:08.300
 But you know, I guess a lot of times people get to a point

1:06:08.300 --> 1:06:10.660
 in their life, you know, in their 20s, early 30s,

1:06:10.660 --> 1:06:13.380
 where now I'm a manager now, I know what I'm doing.

1:06:13.380 --> 1:06:14.860
 No one talks to me like that.

1:06:14.860 --> 1:06:16.460
 First it's like, hey man, you go join bootcamp,

1:06:16.460 --> 1:06:17.660
 I don't care if you are Elon Musk,

1:06:17.660 --> 1:06:19.300
 they're gonna tell you to shut up and do pushups.

1:06:19.300 --> 1:06:21.300
 And that's what's great about it.

1:06:21.300 --> 1:06:24.860
 So you are taking a leap of faith into a world

1:06:24.860 --> 1:06:26.460
 that you're gonna be a tiny fish.

1:06:26.460 --> 1:06:30.100
 And you gotta hope that the people who are guiding you

1:06:30.100 --> 1:06:32.620
 in that journey are gonna have,

1:06:32.620 --> 1:06:34.500
 I can't even say your best interests at heart

1:06:34.500 --> 1:06:35.460
 because they don't even know you,

1:06:35.460 --> 1:06:36.860
 but they'll try to do no harm.

1:06:36.860 --> 1:06:37.700
 And they'll try to help you

1:06:37.700 --> 1:06:39.140
 in the way that they would understand.

1:06:39.140 --> 1:06:40.540
 And I guess that's, for instance,

1:06:40.540 --> 1:06:42.620
 that's what I would try to do with anyone

1:06:42.620 --> 1:06:44.340
 that comes into my gym.

1:06:44.340 --> 1:06:45.700
 I would try to help them in the way

1:06:45.700 --> 1:06:48.660
 that I understand they need as best I can

1:06:48.660 --> 1:06:51.400
 and as safe and reasonable a way as possible,

1:06:51.400 --> 1:06:53.220
 but sometimes in a way that's gonna make them uncomfortable,

1:06:53.220 --> 1:06:55.220
 particularly if physical combat,

1:06:55.220 --> 1:06:58.240
 and it's not something they've done before.

1:06:58.240 --> 1:07:00.900
 If a lot of people go in without even having played,

1:07:00.900 --> 1:07:03.660
 you know, contact sports, and so that can be a big jump.

1:07:03.660 --> 1:07:04.740
 And you have to understand,

1:07:04.740 --> 1:07:07.220
 if that's where you're starting from, no worries,

1:07:07.220 --> 1:07:09.260
 but you're gonna have to kind of work your way to it,

1:07:09.260 --> 1:07:12.220
 and it's gonna be uncomfortable, and that's okay.

1:07:12.220 --> 1:07:13.200
 It's part of the process,

1:07:13.200 --> 1:07:14.820
 and you're gonna have some bumps and bruises,

1:07:14.820 --> 1:07:16.660
 and you're not gonna wanna roll with that guy in the corner

1:07:16.660 --> 1:07:18.660
 because that person's rough, and they beat you up,

1:07:18.660 --> 1:07:20.580
 and they're like, okay, but is this a big hurt

1:07:20.580 --> 1:07:21.820
 or is it a little hurt?

1:07:21.820 --> 1:07:23.300
 If it's a big hurt, okay.

1:07:23.300 --> 1:07:24.340
 If it's a little hurt,

1:07:25.300 --> 1:07:27.300
 need you to center up a little bit.

1:07:27.300 --> 1:07:30.380
 It's such an interesting balance because to find,

1:07:30.380 --> 1:07:32.500
 I think one of the most important things

1:07:32.500 --> 1:07:34.660
 as in anything, I think, in life

1:07:34.660 --> 1:07:39.440
 is the selection of the people that you put around you.

1:07:39.440 --> 1:07:42.020
 I mean, that's true with like getting married.

1:07:42.020 --> 1:07:44.620
 That's true with like if you go to,

1:07:44.620 --> 1:07:46.620
 if people ask me, like graduate students,

1:07:46.620 --> 1:07:51.620
 like your PhD advisor can be the difference.

1:07:51.740 --> 1:07:52.740
 It's everything.

1:07:52.740 --> 1:07:55.300
 It's like you spend five years with somebody,

1:07:55.300 --> 1:07:59.040
 they're going to basically define more impact on you

1:07:59.040 --> 1:08:01.500
 than anybody you marry, anybody you hang out with.

1:08:01.500 --> 1:08:02.420
 It's a huge impact.

1:08:02.420 --> 1:08:05.260
 And the same with the coach selection,

1:08:05.260 --> 1:08:08.940
 which is like the school selection,

1:08:08.940 --> 1:08:11.660
 is it's going to be really important about

1:08:11.660 --> 1:08:16.660
 in terms of like who you select will define how happy,

1:08:16.820 --> 1:08:18.980
 like the trajectory of your growth

1:08:18.980 --> 1:08:21.140
 and how happy you are with the entirety of the experience.

1:08:21.140 --> 1:08:26.140
 And yet, like the flip side of that is,

1:08:26.340 --> 1:08:28.420
 especially if you have an ego,

1:08:28.420 --> 1:08:29.900
 especially if you are the manager

1:08:29.900 --> 1:08:31.300
 that needs to let go of some stuff,

1:08:31.300 --> 1:08:33.380
 you're going to feel like shit

1:08:33.380 --> 1:08:35.820
 with the best kind of coach.

1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:37.540
 That's what you need.

1:08:37.540 --> 1:08:40.540
 But there's a weird balance there to find.

1:08:40.540 --> 1:08:43.480
 Like, I mean, like, and everybody needs a different thing.

1:08:43.480 --> 1:08:48.480
 Like I'm much more, I enjoy being sort of like,

1:08:48.540 --> 1:08:51.440
 it sounds weird, but like I'm, you know,

1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:53.300
 from the wrestling background,

1:08:53.300 --> 1:08:58.040
 I enjoy feeling like crap in the sense like the coach,

1:08:58.040 --> 1:09:00.220
 like getting beat up.

1:09:00.220 --> 1:09:01.580
 I don't actually enjoy it.

1:09:01.580 --> 1:09:03.740
 It's not like some masochistic thing or whatever.

1:09:03.740 --> 1:09:06.560
 It's like, it's the growth.

1:09:06.560 --> 1:09:08.220
 Like I like the anxiety.

1:09:08.220 --> 1:09:12.820
 I like feeling like shit when I go home,

1:09:12.820 --> 1:09:17.380
 like emotionally, physically, it's like, it's growth.

1:09:17.380 --> 1:09:18.420
 It's a sign of growth, right?

1:09:18.420 --> 1:09:20.240
 Like if you're not having to feel those things,

1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:22.580
 you're probably in your comfort zone, which is fine,

1:09:22.580 --> 1:09:24.820
 but that's not your growth zone, right?

1:09:24.820 --> 1:09:27.780
 And everybody has a different threshold for that.

1:09:27.780 --> 1:09:31.700
 And I mean, the beautiful thing about jiu jitsu is like,

1:09:31.700 --> 1:09:34.460
 it's also has like a yoga feel to it.

1:09:34.460 --> 1:09:36.420
 Like you're learning about your body.

1:09:36.420 --> 1:09:40.000
 So depending on the gym and depending on, in fact,

1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:42.300
 the coaches or the people around you within the gym,

1:09:42.300 --> 1:09:45.500
 you can select little groups too, kind of like the people

1:09:45.500 --> 1:09:48.380
 with who you roll, like if you're a smaller person,

1:09:48.380 --> 1:09:50.100
 it doesn't mean you have to go against big people.

1:09:50.100 --> 1:09:53.300
 You can go against the people who like smoke a lot of weed

1:09:53.300 --> 1:09:56.020
 and they're chill, or you can go against like that crazy

1:09:56.020 --> 1:09:59.460
 red blue belt competitor who's like out to destroy everybody.

1:09:59.460 --> 1:10:02.380
 And depending on like what your mindset is,

1:10:02.380 --> 1:10:03.860
 you can kind of select that.

1:10:03.860 --> 1:10:07.820
 It's such a fascinating journey of like,

1:10:07.820 --> 1:10:09.620
 basically self discovery.

1:10:09.620 --> 1:10:10.700
 I couldn't agree with you more.

1:10:10.700 --> 1:10:12.900
 It's, I mean, what you need may change over time, right?

1:10:12.900 --> 1:10:14.980
 Maybe what you needed, what you need today

1:10:14.980 --> 1:10:16.700
 could change six months from now or a year from now.

1:10:16.700 --> 1:10:18.420
 And that's something that I experienced.

1:10:18.420 --> 1:10:20.480
 I'll use my first coach Christian, again,

1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:22.960
 as a great example of someone who I really look up to

1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:25.300
 and respect and someone who helped me a lot.

1:10:25.300 --> 1:10:27.500
 Like at a time when I really needed some guidance

1:10:27.500 --> 1:10:30.180
 and I needed to learn martial arts, but get into,

1:10:30.180 --> 1:10:32.000
 Hensel Gracie's gym was right down the street

1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:33.620
 from where Christian was teaching.

1:10:33.620 --> 1:10:35.140
 And Christian was a blue belt at the time.

1:10:35.140 --> 1:10:37.060
 It was, he was teaching at a place called Fight House,

1:10:37.060 --> 1:10:40.380
 which was this awesome, like, you know, like 90s,

1:10:40.380 --> 1:10:44.180
 early 2000s, you know, warehouse area down

1:10:44.180 --> 1:10:47.020
 on Fashion Avenue in Manhattan,

1:10:47.020 --> 1:10:48.340
 off of like between 7th and 8th.

1:10:48.340 --> 1:10:50.980
 And it was like two basketball courts wide,

1:10:50.980 --> 1:10:52.500
 but like there was the Sambo guys over here.

1:10:52.500 --> 1:10:53.660
 There was the Kali guys over there.

1:10:53.660 --> 1:10:54.500
 There was a Wing Chun over there.

1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:55.620
 There was Jiu Jitsu in the corner.

1:10:55.620 --> 1:10:58.060
 And Hensel's was one of the most famous academies

1:10:58.060 --> 1:10:59.700
 in the world at that time, still is.

1:10:59.700 --> 1:11:02.260
 And I just didn't know what Hensel Gracie was.

1:11:02.260 --> 1:11:04.020
 And I mean, it's a great gym

1:11:04.020 --> 1:11:06.140
 and it's a fantastic place for people to train.

1:11:06.140 --> 1:11:08.820
 But I think what was right for me at the time was to,

1:11:08.820 --> 1:11:12.580
 I stumbled into, you know, like a two person elevator up

1:11:12.580 --> 1:11:15.460
 and found a place where six people trained at that time.

1:11:15.460 --> 1:11:18.780
 And I had someone that could give me some,

1:11:18.780 --> 1:11:20.460
 like in addition to martial arts advice,

1:11:20.460 --> 1:11:22.020
 like personal guidance.

1:11:22.020 --> 1:11:23.600
 And that made a big difference.

1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:26.300
 And then when initially we would have like competitions

1:11:26.300 --> 1:11:29.420
 or like intra, you know, gym competitions

1:11:29.420 --> 1:11:30.660
 with the Sambo guys, we would compete,

1:11:30.660 --> 1:11:31.820
 we would roll with them.

1:11:31.820 --> 1:11:33.100
 And like, again, it was great

1:11:33.100 --> 1:11:34.960
 because they were just a bunch of like Russian dudes

1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:35.900
 from like Brighton Beach.

1:11:35.900 --> 1:11:38.380
 And they would come down and then we would all fight.

1:11:38.380 --> 1:11:39.280
 And then everyone would train

1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:41.060
 and we'd all drink tea and then go home.

1:11:41.060 --> 1:11:45.940
 And anyway, what was, it was super tough.

1:11:45.940 --> 1:11:47.800
 And they were like, again, just a tough group of people.

1:11:47.800 --> 1:11:48.640
 It was great.

1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:51.340
 And then I remember when I decided

1:11:51.340 --> 1:11:52.380
 after like four or five months,

1:11:52.380 --> 1:11:54.140
 I'm like, man, I really want to try to take this seriously.

1:11:54.140 --> 1:11:55.100
 And I told Christian about that.

1:11:55.100 --> 1:11:55.940
 And he's like, well, hey,

1:11:55.940 --> 1:11:56.820
 I think you need to do the following.

1:11:56.820 --> 1:11:58.700
 And it was, you know, like, hey, here's,

1:11:58.700 --> 1:11:59.940
 there was a guy named Jeff Ruth,

1:11:59.940 --> 1:12:01.420
 who was a purple belt at the time,

1:12:01.420 --> 1:12:03.000
 which was a much bigger deal than it is now,

1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:04.660
 but it was 10 and always an MMA fighter,

1:12:04.660 --> 1:12:06.720
 a lot of amateur box spirit, super tough dude.

1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:09.380
 And Jeff was the best person at that time

1:12:09.380 --> 1:12:10.220
 that I'd ever trained with.

1:12:10.220 --> 1:12:11.260
 And I just got squashed.

1:12:11.260 --> 1:12:12.140
 Christian used to beat me up too,

1:12:12.140 --> 1:12:15.060
 but like Jeff would just absolutely kick the crap out of me.

1:12:15.060 --> 1:12:16.600
 And I was like, this is awesome.

1:12:16.600 --> 1:12:18.140
 And this was back when I was at home.

1:12:18.140 --> 1:12:19.380
 I went home for the summer for that.

1:12:19.380 --> 1:12:22.620
 And Chris is like, hey, I think you should stay because I told him that's what I was thinking.

1:12:22.620 --> 1:12:27.580
 And this was a coach that, you know, when it's like when initially was exactly what I needed.

1:12:27.580 --> 1:12:29.460
 And then he's like, well, hey, that's not what I'm doing here.

1:12:29.460 --> 1:12:32.400
 Maybe they're going to be able to help you onto a path that's,

1:12:32.400 --> 1:12:34.820
 that's kind of commensurate with what your goals are at the moment.

1:12:34.820 --> 1:12:37.520
 And then, you know, that was an, that was an interesting thing.

1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:43.820
 And I really got, I feel that I was fortunate to start at a place where my coach was able to transition roles

1:12:43.820 --> 1:12:46.260
 and, and, and do so comfortably.

1:12:46.260 --> 1:12:49.360
 And I think that that also was probably a factor of the fact that, you know,

1:12:49.360 --> 1:12:53.960
 where he'd done some of his training prior, like there've been issues with, with the coach there.

1:12:53.960 --> 1:12:57.340
 We're like not supporting, not having the support, you know, feeling like, hey,

1:12:57.340 --> 1:12:58.580
 like I'm going to hold onto my students.

1:12:58.580 --> 1:13:03.460
 I'm gonna hold onto my best guy or my best girl, even if I can't take them where they need to go.

1:13:03.460 --> 1:13:05.300
 So that was an interesting thing.

1:13:05.300 --> 1:13:10.740
 And just recognizing also though, that the people like the same way you're an individual going into a gym

1:13:10.740 --> 1:13:13.420
 and you don't know what you're getting into your coach is a person too.

1:13:13.420 --> 1:13:18.140
 And he or she, you know, they may have been doing this activity longer than you, but they're not,

1:13:18.140 --> 1:13:20.940
 they're not some weird little, you know, all knowing God.

1:13:20.940 --> 1:13:22.180
 They don't know anything.

1:13:22.180 --> 1:13:23.780
 They may say something that pisses you off.

1:13:23.780 --> 1:13:25.820
 They may, they may yell at you.

1:13:25.820 --> 1:13:26.580
 They may help you.

1:13:26.580 --> 1:13:31.060
 They may inadvertently cause you some sort of, you know, some sort of issue.

1:13:31.060 --> 1:13:35.700
 And just being able to recognize that even though I say this to people and I've said this to people in my gym,

1:13:35.700 --> 1:13:38.900
 I'm like, you know, we're in the service industry, man, but I'm not at your service.

1:13:38.900 --> 1:13:39.980
 Like don't get it twisted.

1:13:39.980 --> 1:13:42.620
 Like I will absolutely do my best to help people.

1:13:42.620 --> 1:13:48.100
 I'm there to do my best as a martial arts coach, but I'm here to do my best as a martial arts coach.

1:13:48.100 --> 1:13:51.020
 And I'll do my best and periodically I make mistakes and I own apology or two,

1:13:51.020 --> 1:13:52.780
 and I'll try to give them out when I can.

1:13:52.780 --> 1:13:54.020
 But we're not McDonald's.

1:13:54.020 --> 1:13:56.420
 It's not, oh, you gave me a hundred bucks, so you do whatever you want in here.

1:13:56.420 --> 1:13:57.100
 This is my house.

1:13:57.100 --> 1:13:57.780
 This is my gym.

1:13:57.780 --> 1:13:58.460
 This is my dojo.

1:13:58.460 --> 1:13:59.580
 This is, this is a martial arts.

1:13:59.580 --> 1:14:00.820
 This is not a basketball team.

1:14:00.820 --> 1:14:01.020
 Yeah.

1:14:01.020 --> 1:14:03.420
 There's something beautiful about martial arts.

1:14:03.420 --> 1:14:08.420
 Like exactly as you said is the coach, like in wrestling and at least collegiate,

1:14:08.420 --> 1:14:16.900
 like high level wrestling is like, there's a dictatorship aspect to a coach that is very important to have.

1:14:16.900 --> 1:14:23.060
 Like this, this ridiculous sometimes nature of like master and so on and bowing, all these traditions.

1:14:23.060 --> 1:14:26.580
 There's something, it seems ridiculous from the outside perhaps,

1:14:26.580 --> 1:14:30.980
 but there's something really powerful to that because that process of you said, why not,

1:14:30.980 --> 1:14:37.700
 of letting go of the leap of faith requires you to believe that the coach has your best interest in mind

1:14:37.700 --> 1:14:44.420
 and just give yourself over to their ideas of how, how you should grow.

1:14:44.420 --> 1:14:45.660
 And that's an interesting thing.

1:14:45.660 --> 1:14:52.620
 I mean, I've never been able to really see coaches I've had as human.

1:14:52.620 --> 1:14:57.060
 They're always, you always, it's like a father figure or like this,

1:14:57.060 --> 1:14:59.180
 you always put them in this position of power.

1:14:59.180 --> 1:15:04.220
 And I think that's, I think at least for me, it's been a very,

1:15:04.220 --> 1:15:09.940
 it's been a very useful way to see the coach because it allows you to not think and let go

1:15:09.940 --> 1:15:14.500
 and really allow yourself to grow and emotionally deal with all the beatings.

1:15:14.500 --> 1:15:18.260
 Well, they'll push you where past oftentimes where you would have stopped yourself, right?

1:15:18.260 --> 1:15:18.900
 Which is great.

1:15:18.900 --> 1:15:22.260
 And then hopefully they know they, if they're paying attention and they're,

1:15:22.260 --> 1:15:23.860
 they're still a person, they can make mistakes,

1:15:23.860 --> 1:15:27.860
 but they'll push you further than you would have gone, but not so far that it's not facilitative.

1:15:27.860 --> 1:15:28.500
 Right.

1:15:28.500 --> 1:15:32.340
 That's something that I can say, like Faraz Zahabi, the head coach at TriStar,

1:15:32.340 --> 1:15:35.220
 my head coach for MMA, Kenny Florian, one of the head coaches for MMA,

1:15:35.220 --> 1:15:37.140
 they've both been phenomenal influences.

1:15:37.140 --> 1:15:40.420
 Paul Shriner, who's the one of the assistants at Marcelo Garcia's Academy,

1:15:41.140 --> 1:15:44.020
 coached me in Jiu Jitsu for a long time, brilliant instructor.

1:15:44.020 --> 1:15:45.300
 They've all been able to do that.

1:15:45.300 --> 1:15:48.100
 And I think what's interesting about all of those guys is they're very sharp,

1:15:48.100 --> 1:15:50.100
 but they're very intuitive as well.

1:15:50.100 --> 1:15:54.500
 And I think that Faraz actually, you know, told me about some of the John Wooden said,

1:15:54.500 --> 1:15:59.460
 John Wooden, the legendary UCLA basketball coach, just a simple philosophical idea.

1:15:59.460 --> 1:16:02.500
 Just, he said, some people's life is a bowl of shit.

1:16:03.060 --> 1:16:04.660
 It needs some whipped cream in it.

1:16:04.660 --> 1:16:06.740
 Some people's life is a bowl of whipped cream.

1:16:06.740 --> 1:16:08.740
 Needs a little bit of shit in it just to balance it out.

1:16:08.740 --> 1:16:09.860
 And it's an interesting thing.

1:16:09.860 --> 1:16:12.580
 Coaching everyone the same way doesn't work.

1:16:12.580 --> 1:16:14.900
 You know, that's, I think the difference between a coach and an instructor.

1:16:14.900 --> 1:16:17.780
 And a lot of times people think they want to coach, but they really want an instructor.

1:16:17.780 --> 1:16:20.580
 I'm like, hey Lex, tell me what to do, not how to do it.

1:16:20.580 --> 1:16:25.060
 And then other times people think they want, you know, an instructor and they really want a coach.

1:16:25.060 --> 1:16:27.060
 I'm like, man, this guy's just giving me information.

1:16:27.060 --> 1:16:28.820
 A coach is so much more than an instructor.

1:16:28.820 --> 1:16:30.020
 And that's a huge leap.

1:16:30.020 --> 1:16:33.060
 And that's something that I think that people need to understand when they're going into

1:16:33.060 --> 1:16:33.460
 martial arts.

1:16:33.460 --> 1:16:36.900
 And I understand, and I can totally grasp why they don't, because how would they know?

1:16:36.900 --> 1:16:41.860
 But I think about this a lot, like me giving you $150 for a month, which is not nothing,

1:16:41.860 --> 1:16:42.420
 that's for sure.

1:16:43.220 --> 1:16:45.140
 That does not, that pays for instructor really.

1:16:45.700 --> 1:16:48.740
 Coach is a relationship that gets developed because can you imagine like just the amount

1:16:48.740 --> 1:16:53.220
 of emotional investment and time thinking away from like, oh, Lex isn't here anymore.

1:16:53.220 --> 1:16:54.020
 What can I do to help him?

1:16:54.020 --> 1:16:55.060
 What does he need?

1:16:55.060 --> 1:16:56.260
 Like that's serious.

1:16:56.260 --> 1:17:01.780
 And that's the difference between, that's oftentimes the difference that getting over

1:17:01.780 --> 1:17:03.700
 the hump in various situations.

1:17:03.700 --> 1:17:08.660
 So it's an interesting, you know, bargain that's being made like commitment by the instructor

1:17:08.660 --> 1:17:10.980
 who becomes a coach, commitment by the student.

1:17:10.980 --> 1:17:12.660
 You know, like there's a financial transaction.

1:17:12.660 --> 1:17:16.820
 There's a lot of things going on there, but I feel very fortunate to have had not just

1:17:16.820 --> 1:17:18.420
 instructors in my time, but coaches.

1:17:18.420 --> 1:17:22.260
 And that means sometimes we butted heads and sometimes I look back and I think I was right.

1:17:22.260 --> 1:17:24.660
 And other times I look back on my own, no, they were definitely right.

1:17:24.660 --> 1:17:29.620
 But there was always the trust with the exception of one time that I feel that trust was greatly

1:17:29.620 --> 1:17:35.940
 betrayed that rightly or wrongly, whether mistakes, mistakes will be made, but everyone

1:17:35.940 --> 1:17:39.460
 is attempting to do the right thing under no circumstances.

1:17:39.460 --> 1:17:43.540
 Is what I intentionally do anything malicious, you know, versus, Hey, I might've done.

1:17:43.540 --> 1:17:46.500
 I might've burnt your house down, but you can be darn sure it wasn't on purpose.

1:17:46.500 --> 1:17:51.060
 And I think that as long as there's that mutual understanding and mutual belief of goodwill,

1:17:51.060 --> 1:17:53.140
 which again, doesn't just magic up out of nowhere.

1:17:53.140 --> 1:17:54.180
 I understand.

1:17:54.180 --> 1:17:56.340
 I think that that's when then great things can happen.

1:17:56.340 --> 1:17:59.780
 And I look at all the athletes that I know, you know, the guys and girls that I've watched

1:17:59.780 --> 1:18:03.380
 become fantastic in various places, almost invariably.

1:18:03.380 --> 1:18:04.340
 It never happened alone.

1:18:05.140 --> 1:18:05.540
 Yeah.

1:18:05.540 --> 1:18:05.940
 Yeah.

1:18:05.940 --> 1:18:07.380
 I'm really torn about that.

1:18:07.380 --> 1:18:09.540
 Like, maybe you can help.

1:18:09.540 --> 1:18:10.980
 Have you seen the movie Whiplash?

1:18:12.180 --> 1:18:17.460
 So it's, I would say from an outsider's perspective, people should watch it.

1:18:17.460 --> 1:18:20.180
 It's, I guess, jazz band.

1:18:20.180 --> 1:18:23.860
 It's a movie about a drummer and the instructor.

1:18:23.860 --> 1:18:29.060
 And he, it's a basically, I would say from the outsider's perspective, it's a toxic

1:18:29.060 --> 1:18:36.340
 relationship, but he's really the coach, whatever we call him, pushes the musician, the drummer

1:18:36.340 --> 1:18:43.460
 or to his limits, like to where he just feels like shit emotionally.

1:18:43.460 --> 1:18:49.060
 It's a, it looks like a toxic relationship, but it's one that ultimately is very productive

1:18:49.060 --> 1:18:52.500
 for the improvement of the musician.

1:18:52.500 --> 1:18:59.060
 I have the same, like in my own experience, I had, I got a chance to train at a couple

1:18:59.060 --> 1:19:00.500
 of places regularly.

1:19:00.500 --> 1:19:06.820
 And so one of my coaches who is a great human being, a lot of people love him.

1:19:06.820 --> 1:19:10.900
 But when I was a blue belt, he was pushing me a lot for competition.

1:19:11.700 --> 1:19:21.060
 And every time I step on the mat, I was anxious and almost afraid of training because of like

1:19:21.060 --> 1:19:22.420
 the places I'm going to have to go.

1:19:22.420 --> 1:19:30.420
 And then the, I can't, I don't know what's good or bad because I think I've become a

1:19:30.420 --> 1:19:32.820
 better person because of that experience.

1:19:32.820 --> 1:19:33.860
 Like I needed that.

1:19:34.580 --> 1:19:40.420
 And on the flip side, like the place I got my black belt from, it's Balanced Studios.

1:19:40.420 --> 1:19:46.820
 I remember also blue belt, the coach sitting down and I was going to competition and he

1:19:46.820 --> 1:19:56.820
 saw something in me where he said, you know, like, good luck, but win or lose, we always

1:19:56.820 --> 1:19:57.380
 love you.

1:19:58.260 --> 1:20:02.980
 Like, I, I really, I remember that because I really needed that at that time.

1:20:02.980 --> 1:20:05.220
 Like I was putting so much pressure on myself.

1:20:05.220 --> 1:20:10.580
 Like I'm not an actual professional competitor, you know, I just competed.

1:20:10.580 --> 1:20:15.220
 Like I'm a PhD student, like, but like it was clearly having a psychological effect

1:20:15.220 --> 1:20:21.380
 on me and that's what a great coach does is like, you know, it's like life is more

1:20:21.380 --> 1:20:23.700
 important than Jiu Jitsu since it's bigger.

1:20:23.700 --> 1:20:30.580
 So they find, you use Jiu Jitsu when you need it to grow as a person and when it

1:20:30.580 --> 1:20:34.980
 overwhelms you, you have to pull that person out, like look at the bigger picture, always

1:20:34.980 --> 1:20:38.820
 look at the bigger picture and it's fascinating and I don't know what to make of it.

1:20:38.820 --> 1:20:44.260
 I don't think I would have it any other way is both the anxiety and the, and the love

1:20:44.260 --> 1:20:45.540
 and the love.

1:20:45.540 --> 1:20:46.100
 Yeah.

1:20:46.100 --> 1:20:49.380
 I think that I couldn't, that's a really interesting thing that you're describing

1:20:49.380 --> 1:20:52.980
 that I guess it kind of brings me back to a lot of the other things we've been

1:20:52.980 --> 1:20:58.180
 discussing is just almost like the, the reciprocal nature of everything where no

1:20:58.180 --> 1:20:59.620
 pressure, that's great.

1:21:00.340 --> 1:21:01.460
 Everyone's happy all the time.

1:21:01.460 --> 1:21:05.300
 It's either, I mean, let's, uh, use the example of sci fi movies to see the matrix,

1:21:05.300 --> 1:21:08.260
 which of course the first one was amazing and then each subsequent movie made the

1:21:08.260 --> 1:21:09.220
 series worse.

1:21:09.220 --> 1:21:14.580
 But, um, but basically, yeah, I've heard, we'll see, I was hoping for the best, but,

1:21:14.580 --> 1:21:17.780
 um, but basically, uh, you know, let's say, Hey, which we started with our first

1:21:17.780 --> 1:21:22.820
 initial world agent Smith says to Neo is like our first world was a utopia where

1:21:22.820 --> 1:21:24.660
 everyone was happy and nothing ever went wrong.

1:21:24.660 --> 1:21:27.380
 It's like your primitive cerebrum rejected it.

1:21:27.380 --> 1:21:31.380
 And I think that there's obviously, I mean, what do I think, but I guess, well,

1:21:31.380 --> 1:21:33.060
 I'm here, so I might as well say what I think.

1:21:33.060 --> 1:21:39.460
 Um, I guess, uh, you know, great things are fantastic.

1:21:39.460 --> 1:21:42.180
 A kind, gentle place is fantastic.

1:21:42.180 --> 1:21:45.700
 And this is again, why I love dune is I think dune does such a great job of, of

1:21:45.700 --> 1:21:48.580
 expressing Frank Herbert does such a great job of expressing again, the

1:21:48.580 --> 1:21:50.260
 reciprocal nature of these ideas.

1:21:50.260 --> 1:21:53.860
 You know, look at, uh, look at Sparta for instance, or at least what I understand

1:21:53.860 --> 1:21:56.580
 of Sparta from the reading and also watching 300.

1:21:56.580 --> 1:22:00.820
 Um, uh, you know, and reading the Wikipedia and reading the Wikipedia

1:22:00.820 --> 1:22:02.980
 article about the movie, not the place.

1:22:02.980 --> 1:22:07.620
 Um, but, uh, it's, um, that's a hard, brutal place.

1:22:08.260 --> 1:22:10.420
 And that was their benefit to that.

1:22:10.420 --> 1:22:11.540
 Like, absolutely.

1:22:11.540 --> 1:22:12.980
 Was there drawback to that?

1:22:12.980 --> 1:22:13.780
 Absolutely.

1:22:13.780 --> 1:22:14.740
 Is it sustainable?

1:22:14.740 --> 1:22:17.300
 I should probably think probably not.

1:22:17.300 --> 1:22:21.380
 Um, I mean, granted it hasn't sustained, but I mean, that type of a, of a thing,

1:22:21.380 --> 1:22:22.980
 it, it burns too hot almost.

1:22:22.980 --> 1:22:26.820
 And it, uh, it, it destroys the host at a certain point.

1:22:26.820 --> 1:22:30.660
 And, you know, I guess that, that type of unforgiving nature, but in

1:22:30.660 --> 1:22:33.700
 entirely, entirely permissive has its own issues.

1:22:33.700 --> 1:22:37.700
 And I guess coming back into your, what your description of like describing a

1:22:37.700 --> 1:22:41.460
 toxic relationship is a very dangerous and tricky thing because it's almost

1:22:41.460 --> 1:22:43.140
 like, uh, it's like bird's eye view.

1:22:43.140 --> 1:22:46.580
 Me, you know, you see, let's say a husband and a wife arguing, you know,

1:22:46.580 --> 1:22:49.220
 like, all right, well, sort of somebody hitting somebody.

1:22:49.220 --> 1:22:53.540
 I need to keep myself out of this because I have no idea what I'm seeing

1:22:53.540 --> 1:22:57.300
 something, but I don't know what's going on or why specifically.

1:22:57.300 --> 1:23:00.980
 And again, short of it going to a place that, that just out of bounds,

1:23:02.100 --> 1:23:03.300
 I don't know who's right here.

1:23:03.300 --> 1:23:04.260
 I don't know who's wrong.

1:23:04.260 --> 1:23:07.300
 And I don't know what phase of this things are in.

1:23:07.300 --> 1:23:12.660
 So I guess long term was good for both people.

1:23:12.660 --> 1:23:12.900
 Right.

1:23:12.900 --> 1:23:13.700
 It's dangerous for it.

1:23:13.700 --> 1:23:16.660
 So if I want to put my finger on the scale, I can understand the desire to do

1:23:16.660 --> 1:23:17.700
 them like, Hey guys, let's break it up.

1:23:17.700 --> 1:23:18.100
 Yeah.

1:23:18.100 --> 1:23:21.140
 But, and that may be the right thing at the time, but at the same time, I'm not

1:23:21.140 --> 1:23:21.460
 sure.

1:23:21.460 --> 1:23:23.780
 So I think back to all of the times that.

1:23:23.780 --> 1:23:27.940
 You know, that like you mentioned, your coach pushing you when very, very hard.

1:23:27.940 --> 1:23:30.980
 And then other times going like, Hey, let's put it in perspective here.

1:23:30.980 --> 1:23:33.140
 I think that's an interesting thing for high performance.

1:23:33.140 --> 1:23:36.180
 And I think that we're seeing that again, societally, you know, now, or at least

1:23:36.180 --> 1:23:40.500
 maybe that's just pops up on my internet feed periodically but coaches shouldn't

1:23:40.500 --> 1:23:43.220
 be allowed to do this or yell at this person to yell at that person.

1:23:43.220 --> 1:23:46.100
 Like, well, have you ever been go to a boxing gym?

1:23:46.980 --> 1:23:48.180
 It's not a commercial entity.

1:23:48.180 --> 1:23:54.100
 Not really a real box, not LA boxing, not a USC gym, like a real place.

1:23:54.100 --> 1:23:57.460
 You're going to see what things are like when it's entirely performance based.

1:23:57.460 --> 1:23:59.060
 Go to wrestling room at a high level.

1:23:59.060 --> 1:24:01.620
 You know, again, there's, there's left and right limits and there are such

1:24:01.620 --> 1:24:04.900
 things obviously as abuse, of course, but, and that should never be tolerated.

1:24:04.900 --> 1:24:08.740
 Um, but it's not a commercial entity.

1:24:09.620 --> 1:24:12.580
 I don't need to be sweet to you if you're, if you're screwing up, if you're

1:24:12.580 --> 1:24:16.180
 dropping the ball and in fact, recognizing that I'm not doing you a favor or the

1:24:16.180 --> 1:24:21.140
 favor or the team a favor by, by being permissive of that type of behavior.

1:24:21.140 --> 1:24:22.340
 I think is important.

1:24:22.340 --> 1:24:25.060
 Everything in its context and at its time is important.

1:24:25.060 --> 1:24:28.980
 And I guess I can think again at the times that I've been put, put, or had

1:24:28.980 --> 1:24:34.020
 put on me, like a great deal of pressure to do X, Y, or Z or to succeed, um, or

1:24:34.020 --> 1:24:35.220
 to push for success.

1:24:35.220 --> 1:24:38.980
 And I can't look back fondly enough on those times.

1:24:38.980 --> 1:24:42.580
 They were tough at the time, but without that, I'm not sitting here without that.

1:24:42.580 --> 1:24:48.820
 I don't go from growing up in a, in a very nice family in the suburbs to fighting at

1:24:48.820 --> 1:24:52.820
 the highest level in jujitsu, gi, no gi, and now in mixed martial arts, starting a

1:24:52.820 --> 1:24:53.940
 career at age 27.

1:24:54.580 --> 1:24:58.260
 You know, I don't, it just doesn't happen because people generally speaking from

1:24:58.260 --> 1:25:02.340
 that background, don't get pushed hard enough physically to be able to make that

1:25:02.340 --> 1:25:02.900
 transition.

1:25:03.620 --> 1:25:07.220
 And that has benefits and it has drawbacks.

1:25:07.220 --> 1:25:09.540
 You know, when you stare into the abyss, it stares back.

1:25:09.540 --> 1:25:12.020
 And I think that that's an important thing to understand.

1:25:12.020 --> 1:25:15.860
 You know, you stare long enough, you, you can become something that you don't, that

1:25:15.860 --> 1:25:17.060
 you would be sorry that you did.

1:25:17.060 --> 1:25:20.340
 You don't look enough and you don't have perspective either.

1:25:20.340 --> 1:25:22.980
 You know, and I, I think that that's an interesting thing.

1:25:22.980 --> 1:25:26.340
 I can speak to someone who's relative to being someone who's relatively articulate

1:25:26.340 --> 1:25:27.140
 and reasonable.

1:25:27.140 --> 1:25:30.740
 I try to be reasonable, but you know, I'll say in sparring, if people get crazy with

1:25:30.740 --> 1:25:32.900
 me, they get a warning and then I'm a crack them.

1:25:33.460 --> 1:25:35.460
 And what did they expect?

1:25:35.460 --> 1:25:40.500
 Oh, they hear the guy on a, on an interview, but who did they think they were meeting?

1:25:40.500 --> 1:25:43.940
 Cause there's also the guy in the ring and there's layers there too.

1:25:43.940 --> 1:25:45.060
 I remember training with you.

1:25:45.060 --> 1:25:46.180
 It was kind of funny.

1:25:46.900 --> 1:25:51.700
 There's like, there's, well, you didn't know who I was.

1:25:51.700 --> 1:25:54.740
 I mean, you still like, I have a really good straight ankle up by the way.

1:25:55.860 --> 1:25:56.360
 That.

1:25:57.300 --> 1:26:01.940
 So I don't remember what rank I was, but it might've been purple or something like

1:26:01.940 --> 1:26:02.180
 that.

1:26:02.180 --> 1:26:08.100
 And I did some, like I, you had this look on your face, which I've often seen in

1:26:08.100 --> 1:26:08.820
 black belts.

1:26:08.820 --> 1:26:16.260
 It's like, here he goes again, like here, here's him trying this thing.

1:26:16.980 --> 1:26:21.620
 And then when I kind of annoyed you a little bit with it, now I get that it was a good

1:26:21.620 --> 1:26:25.700
 at like, I, you know, I did something somewhat effective, like some, like maybe a little

1:26:25.700 --> 1:26:26.660
 bit off balance.

1:26:26.660 --> 1:26:27.380
 Yeah.

1:26:27.380 --> 1:26:31.300
 There's a, I just peeled off a little layer of Ryan Hall to where I was like, okay, let

1:26:31.300 --> 1:26:38.500
 me, let me like, there, there's like layers underneath Mike Tyson somewhere in there.

1:26:38.500 --> 1:26:41.940
 Like, so it was like, okay, this like new guy rolls in here.

1:26:41.940 --> 1:26:44.260
 He thinks he can do the stupid thing.

1:26:44.260 --> 1:26:46.740
 And then, and then you started to beat the hell out of me.

1:26:46.740 --> 1:26:51.300
 But the, the, the point is there's layers here from the guy who was being interviewed

1:26:51.300 --> 1:26:55.540
 now to like Genghis Khan, but it's, but it's all in the same body.

1:26:55.540 --> 1:26:55.780
 Right.

1:26:55.780 --> 1:26:57.380
 But it's like, all of us are like that, right.

1:26:57.380 --> 1:27:00.020
 In various different directions and recognizing that's okay.

1:27:00.020 --> 1:27:03.620
 It's just, there are consequences to all every choice that we make as a consequence.

1:27:03.620 --> 1:27:06.260
 Sometimes there's like objectively wrong or objectively right.

1:27:06.260 --> 1:27:08.500
 But at least in my mind, that's a pretty small box.

1:27:08.500 --> 1:27:10.900
 Everything else is just, there's a consequence to that.

1:27:10.900 --> 1:27:12.100
 Do you like that consequence?

1:27:12.100 --> 1:27:13.060
 Do you not?

1:27:13.060 --> 1:27:14.420
 And who do I want to become?

1:27:14.420 --> 1:27:18.420
 What do I want to try to hone myself or anyone else into?

1:27:18.420 --> 1:27:22.100
 And also like, but this is something I've screwed up as a coach plenty of times.

1:27:22.100 --> 1:27:26.100
 You know, like if someone says, if you're, if like, I come to them like Lex, I really,

1:27:26.100 --> 1:27:28.580
 really want to take, you know, research very seriously.

1:27:28.580 --> 1:27:29.860
 Like, okay, I believe you.

1:27:29.860 --> 1:27:33.300
 Now I haven't shown you that, but I believe you like, okay.

1:27:33.300 --> 1:27:38.100
 And now me not showing up to research or to study or not being up until three in the morning

1:27:38.100 --> 1:27:40.100
 thinking about this is no longer acceptable.

1:27:40.100 --> 1:27:44.020
 There was a time like five seconds before me making that statement that if I went to

1:27:44.020 --> 1:27:47.300
 bed without reading the book that I needed to read, no worries.

1:27:47.300 --> 1:27:51.300
 But the second that I made that statement, your expectations for me changed.

1:27:51.300 --> 1:27:55.220
 And maybe that's something that I've screwed up a whole bunch of times in my, as a teacher.

1:27:55.220 --> 1:27:58.100
 Cause it's an interesting thing, obviously, you know, being a, like running a martial

1:27:58.100 --> 1:28:03.380
 arts school is as you're principally an athlete is sometimes I don't pay enough attention

1:28:03.380 --> 1:28:04.420
 to what people are doing.

1:28:04.420 --> 1:28:05.380
 I just go, oh, okay.

1:28:05.380 --> 1:28:06.260
 You say X, Y, Z.

1:28:06.260 --> 1:28:07.060
 I'm like, Roger that.

1:28:07.060 --> 1:28:07.540
 I believe you.

1:28:07.540 --> 1:28:08.100
 Cool.

1:28:08.100 --> 1:28:13.380
 I will now put you in category X and whether rightly or wrongly, like maybe this person

1:28:13.380 --> 1:28:16.660
 didn't understand what they were asking for, or I didn't express this or the other.

1:28:16.660 --> 1:28:18.500
 And it just, it caused cross wires.

1:28:18.500 --> 1:28:20.180
 And then most times you just, you hash it out.

1:28:20.180 --> 1:28:22.580
 You have a discussion, you figure out, get to the bottom of what people are trying to

1:28:22.580 --> 1:28:23.300
 do or what they want.

1:28:23.860 --> 1:28:26.980
 But if I was paying more attention, I think I could have been a lot more effective.

1:28:26.980 --> 1:28:30.100
 Or if I had more experience and sometimes maybe I'm not sharp enough or I don't, I'm

1:28:30.100 --> 1:28:32.420
 not perceptive enough to be able to, to see what's going on.

1:28:32.420 --> 1:28:36.260
 And maybe with years more down the line, I'll be able to have a sharper perception.

1:28:36.260 --> 1:28:41.060
 But I think that's another one of those interesting things that some, that sometimes I would caution

1:28:41.060 --> 1:28:44.740
 or not caution, but just inform a prospective martial arts student, depending upon where

1:28:44.740 --> 1:28:49.300
 you're going you know, this you, both you and also your coach or other people in the

1:28:49.300 --> 1:28:50.340
 room, they wear many hats.

1:28:50.340 --> 1:28:52.100
 And sometimes there's a, I had the wrong hat on.

1:28:52.100 --> 1:28:54.260
 You were talking to me as Lex the guy.

1:28:54.260 --> 1:28:55.620
 I didn't realize you were talking to me.

1:28:55.620 --> 1:28:56.820
 I thought you were talking to me as Lex the guy.

1:28:56.820 --> 1:28:58.500
 I didn't realize you're talking to me as Lex the martial artist.

1:28:58.500 --> 1:28:59.460
 I'm like, Oh crap.

1:28:59.460 --> 1:29:00.500
 I was talking to the wrong person.

1:29:00.500 --> 1:29:05.620
 So it's almost like if you had a, like I run my gym with my wife, she's a black belt.

1:29:05.620 --> 1:29:07.300
 So she's my wife.

1:29:07.300 --> 1:29:11.380
 She's my peers as a martial artist, uh, in Jiu Jitsu.

1:29:11.380 --> 1:29:12.820
 He's here by the way, in judging.

1:29:12.820 --> 1:29:13.780
 So exactly.

1:29:13.780 --> 1:29:14.100
 All right.

1:29:14.100 --> 1:29:15.060
 Well, all right.

1:29:15.060 --> 1:29:16.820
 So, but, but a fellow black belt.

1:29:16.820 --> 1:29:19.300
 And I guess like another thing, she doesn't have a microphone, so you can't hear all the

1:29:19.300 --> 1:29:20.100
 trash she's talking.

1:29:20.100 --> 1:29:20.820
 Exactly.

1:29:20.820 --> 1:29:21.940
 But it can be tough.

1:29:21.940 --> 1:29:23.460
 And that's something that we've had to work through a lot.

1:29:23.460 --> 1:29:26.260
 And it's like looking back and it's like now being where I'm at now.

1:29:26.260 --> 1:29:29.140
 And it's easy for me to say that cause she's in the room and I don't want her to stab me,

1:29:29.140 --> 1:29:33.540
 just continue to slowly poison me over time, which frankly I understand.

1:29:33.540 --> 1:29:38.180
 Um, you know, it's, it's the sort of thing that is now way more effective than anything

1:29:38.180 --> 1:29:40.660
 else I could really reasonably expect to have.

1:29:40.660 --> 1:29:45.300
 Um, but there were times when, when both of us, you know, were justifiably annoyed at

1:29:45.300 --> 1:29:47.700
 the other because of crossed wires.

1:29:47.700 --> 1:29:50.260
 And sometimes, you know, you'll just have to scream in any way or misunderstanding anyway.

1:29:50.260 --> 1:29:54.180
 But again, like I've, I coached some of my friends, I've coached, I've coached my friend

1:29:54.180 --> 1:29:56.580
 who I've known since I was four years old.

1:29:56.580 --> 1:29:58.740
 You know, sometimes I don't go, Hey buddy, how are you doing?

1:29:58.740 --> 1:30:00.180
 Sometimes it's like, what the fuck are you doing?

1:30:00.180 --> 1:30:00.740
 Put your hand over there.

1:30:00.740 --> 1:30:01.780
 How many times we talked about this?

1:30:01.780 --> 1:30:06.100
 And then you walk away and you can see him look at you crooked and you're like, Oh crap.

1:30:06.100 --> 1:30:06.260
 Oh yeah.

1:30:06.260 --> 1:30:07.620
 He thought I was talking to his friend.

1:30:07.620 --> 1:30:07.780
 Yeah.

1:30:07.780 --> 1:30:11.220
 Well, all right, let, we need to talk this one out, hashing out and not he's wrong.

1:30:11.220 --> 1:30:12.820
 How could he possibly think that way?

1:30:12.820 --> 1:30:14.340
 Like, Oh no, I totally understand that.

1:30:14.340 --> 1:30:18.500
 But if I was 22, like doesn't need no, I'm a purple belt, some nonsense like that.

1:30:18.500 --> 1:30:22.260
 And it's, and it doesn't come from a bad place, but it's just, I guess that comes back to

1:30:22.260 --> 1:30:23.140
 society to anything.

1:30:23.140 --> 1:30:26.020
 People only had the perspective that they have and the awareness that we have.

1:30:26.020 --> 1:30:30.260
 And so again, going back and going, Hey guys, grace, like I don't expect, it's not fair

1:30:30.260 --> 1:30:32.180
 for me to go, I fight UFC.

1:30:32.180 --> 1:30:36.100
 Why doesn't this guy who came in as an attorney understand how hardcore this needs to be?

1:30:36.100 --> 1:30:36.980
 I'm like, how could he?

1:30:36.980 --> 1:30:37.620
 Yeah.

1:30:37.620 --> 1:30:43.700
 And at the same time though, if, if I'm using the language of someone that is interested

1:30:43.700 --> 1:30:46.820
 in at least performance from a martial arts perspective, I understand how that could be

1:30:47.380 --> 1:30:47.940
 off putting.

1:30:47.940 --> 1:30:51.220
 Let's say for instance, someone that's like all of that would be out of bounds in their

1:30:51.220 --> 1:30:52.340
 normal workplace.

1:30:52.340 --> 1:30:56.340
 But if they think of the gym as my office, then whether they agree or disagree with what's

1:30:56.340 --> 1:30:58.740
 going on, they go, okay, I hear why I see why that might happen.

1:30:58.740 --> 1:30:59.860
 Let's talk about this.

1:30:59.860 --> 1:31:04.580
 And we can, again, all push forward in a positive direction that benefits, I guess, everyone's

1:31:04.580 --> 1:31:05.860
 journey throughout the activity.

1:31:05.860 --> 1:31:08.740
 And on top of all that, there's moods.

1:31:08.740 --> 1:31:15.540
 Like I, I mean, especially lately, I think two days ago, maybe yesterday, no, two days

1:31:15.540 --> 1:31:21.140
 ago, I've never been that cranky in my life.

1:31:21.140 --> 1:31:27.140
 I think, I don't know what it was, but I wanted to tell everybody how much they annoyed me.

1:31:28.020 --> 1:31:34.660
 It was like, I was just very conscious of this feeling of like, why, why is this happening

1:31:34.660 --> 1:31:35.220
 right now?

1:31:35.220 --> 1:31:40.260
 So I consciously decided as I usually do in those cases to not say anything to anybody.

1:31:40.260 --> 1:31:41.060
 How do you do that?

1:31:43.620 --> 1:31:47.060
 Well, I, you know, it's, it's yeah.

1:31:47.060 --> 1:31:52.420
 Meditate because it's not, I tend to, I tend to then visualize what's going to happen in

1:31:52.420 --> 1:31:55.060
 the next, like, how is this going to make my life better?

1:31:55.700 --> 1:32:06.900
 Like if I say something that mean to somebody else, I have just started a conflict that

1:32:07.460 --> 1:32:13.140
 will just escalate, will continue, will add more conflict to my life.

1:32:13.140 --> 1:32:17.380
 It will make things, I just don't like the feeling you will create.

1:32:17.380 --> 1:32:23.700
 And so you live in enough life to know that like, it's just like with like street fighting.

1:32:24.340 --> 1:32:28.900
 I would get into a lot of fights when I was younger, just on the street, but then you

1:32:28.900 --> 1:32:32.820
 realize like, it's not like a jujitsu match or something like that.

1:32:32.820 --> 1:32:34.900
 It's not, it'll escalate.

1:32:35.380 --> 1:32:38.020
 It'll, it might come back at you.

1:32:38.420 --> 1:32:40.900
 It'll like that person might find you again.

1:32:40.900 --> 1:32:48.580
 But more importantly, the anxiety of it, of having created little enemies in this

1:32:48.580 --> 1:32:51.700
 world, distorts the way you see the world.

1:32:52.020 --> 1:32:57.380
 So I've noticed that like, if I am shitty to people on the internet, which I haven't

1:32:57.380 --> 1:33:02.820
 been, I think in a long time is like, it, it somehow brings the shittiness to you

1:33:02.820 --> 1:33:07.300
 more and more, it escalates like the more love you put out there, the more like the

1:33:07.300 --> 1:33:11.140
 people who put love out, like surround you.

1:33:11.140 --> 1:33:12.580
 Well, you mentioned forgiveness as well.

1:33:12.660 --> 1:33:16.900
 Like you said, like, I guess back to the original, you know, the Holocaust survivor

1:33:16.900 --> 1:33:20.740
 scenario where you're like, oh my God, like you think of the ultimate in, in like, I've

1:33:20.740 --> 1:33:24.980
 never experienced one, one billionth of that level of, of pain and horror.

1:33:24.980 --> 1:33:27.300
 And it's like, and I can't let this little thing go.

1:33:28.100 --> 1:33:29.460
 You know, I guess that's an interesting thing.

1:33:29.460 --> 1:33:32.420
 I think you're just making the point in your personal life, I guess the same way.

1:33:32.420 --> 1:33:32.900
 Right?

1:33:33.220 --> 1:33:33.700
 Yeah.

1:33:34.180 --> 1:33:34.500
 Yeah.

1:33:34.580 --> 1:33:35.860
 And on the internet, it's hard.

1:33:35.860 --> 1:33:42.100
 I've somehow gotten, I mean, you've, you've had a level of celebrity for a while.

1:33:42.420 --> 1:33:47.620
 I've recently gotten some level of like celebrity and like these people who are

1:33:47.620 --> 1:33:53.700
 just shitty for no reason come out from all, from all places, like calling me a

1:33:53.700 --> 1:33:57.380
 fraud or anything else.

1:33:57.460 --> 1:33:59.380
 It was Jay and Silent Bob, Strike Back.

1:33:59.540 --> 1:34:01.940
 They find out a movie is going to be made about them and people were talking shit

1:34:01.940 --> 1:34:03.460
 on the internet and they're like, what's the internet?

1:34:03.460 --> 1:34:05.860
 And then someone shows them and they're like, what?

1:34:05.860 --> 1:34:08.580
 And they go to a message board and they go to Hollywood to try to stop it from

1:34:08.580 --> 1:34:09.060
 being made.

1:34:09.060 --> 1:34:11.700
 And they eventually get money for their likeness and they use the money to buy

1:34:11.700 --> 1:34:14.420
 plane tickets and fly around and beat the shit out of all the people that talk bad

1:34:14.420 --> 1:34:14.820
 about them.

1:34:15.380 --> 1:34:15.620
 Yeah.

1:34:15.620 --> 1:34:16.020
 It's tough.

1:34:16.020 --> 1:34:20.420
 I mean, it's I'm, I'm having trouble with it cause there's people like, yeah,

1:34:20.420 --> 1:34:24.820
 there's, you know, there's posts and forums and like heated discussions about

1:34:25.060 --> 1:34:26.420
 is like sweeping a fraud.

1:34:26.820 --> 1:34:27.540
 I don't know.

1:34:27.700 --> 1:34:28.740
 What has he really done?

1:34:28.740 --> 1:34:32.020
 And there's like, and then there's people like, well, I think he's an all right

1:34:32.020 --> 1:34:33.060
 guy, but I'm not sure.

1:34:33.060 --> 1:34:39.060
 Like, like there's like literal discussions and I'm like, like nobody,

1:34:39.060 --> 1:34:43.460
 like if you increase the level of celebrity, there's going to be like one

1:34:43.460 --> 1:34:47.780
 of the things that hurts my heart a little bit is like some level of toxicity

1:34:47.780 --> 1:34:48.900
 around Joe Rogan.

1:34:48.900 --> 1:34:54.340
 For example, there's like communities of people that now like talk about him

1:34:54.340 --> 1:34:56.260
 selling out, for example, all that kind of stuff.

1:34:56.820 --> 1:35:02.900
 And I don't, you know, and Joe I've talked to him about it is amazing that

1:35:02.900 --> 1:35:05.540
 he he says, don't read the comments.

1:35:05.540 --> 1:35:07.300
 He legitimately doesn't read the comments.

1:35:07.940 --> 1:35:12.020
 His heart and his soul doesn't give a damn about the comments.

1:35:12.020 --> 1:35:14.500
 All he gives a damn about is his friends.

1:35:14.500 --> 1:35:19.060
 Like one of the things that's really inspiring to me and that's I've had a

1:35:19.060 --> 1:35:24.660
 conversation with them offline about Spotify and the removed episodes.

1:35:24.660 --> 1:35:25.460
 People are curious.

1:35:25.460 --> 1:35:26.180
 What's Spotify?

1:35:26.180 --> 1:35:32.260
 Um, it's, uh, it's a thing on the internet where, uh, I think you can play

1:35:32.260 --> 1:35:40.260
 Taylor Swift songs on, um, but you can also now play Joe Rogan podcasts and

1:35:40.260 --> 1:35:42.100
 they gave him a hundred million dollars.

1:35:42.100 --> 1:35:46.420
 So that that's, um, you know, that's it's yeah.

1:35:46.980 --> 1:35:51.220
 Uh, but the thing I've had a discussion with him and I made a video about it

1:35:51.220 --> 1:35:55.780
 that I took down because of the toxicity is like, it's hard to put into words,

1:35:55.780 --> 1:35:59.620
 but he will give away the a hundred million in a second.

1:36:00.500 --> 1:36:06.260
 If he ever has to compromise who he is, like he doesn't, I mean, he already

1:36:06.260 --> 1:36:10.500
 said, as he talked about, he's made quote unquote, fuck you money a long

1:36:10.500 --> 1:36:14.420
 time ago, he doesn't need any more money.

1:36:14.420 --> 1:36:15.140
 He doesn't care.

1:36:15.940 --> 1:36:19.220
 It's nice to have money, whatever, but like, he'll give it away.

1:36:19.220 --> 1:36:26.740
 So the it's nice to see when people like him at a level of celebrity level of

1:36:26.740 --> 1:36:31.460
 success and financial success, don't change at all.

1:36:31.460 --> 1:36:36.420
 They're just the same thing that makes you happy is talking in his case, talking

1:36:36.420 --> 1:36:40.020
 shit with his friends in the case of most of us really just, just hanging out

1:36:40.020 --> 1:36:46.020
 with friends, doing the things you love in his case, doing the things he loves

1:36:46.020 --> 1:36:53.860
 without any, like, you know, the Texas way, the freedom, like without any

1:36:53.860 --> 1:36:58.180
 corporate bureaucracy bullshit that rolls in and says, well, maybe you

1:36:58.180 --> 1:37:02.500
 shouldn't say fuck, you know, like more than 20 times a podcast or something

1:37:02.500 --> 1:37:05.940
 like that, like those kinds of like rules, like people, like he says in a

1:37:05.940 --> 1:37:10.740
 suit and tie, they show up and say stuff oddly enough people that could never

1:37:10.740 --> 1:37:12.420
 have done what he does.

1:37:12.420 --> 1:37:13.300
 Yeah, exactly.

1:37:13.300 --> 1:37:15.860
 And it's kind of inspiring to see that.

1:37:15.860 --> 1:37:21.860
 And I hope people, I hope people realize how special of a human he is.

1:37:21.860 --> 1:37:27.140
 He's inspired like people like me, like I'm just, I'm a scientist, right?

1:37:27.140 --> 1:37:32.260
 So he inspired somebody like me from a very different walk of life to be like

1:37:32.260 --> 1:37:35.780
 kind to others, to be open minded.

1:37:36.420 --> 1:37:39.380
 I don't know that it's a special dude.

1:37:39.380 --> 1:37:42.740
 So like people need to support that and treasure that as opposed to

1:37:42.740 --> 1:37:47.540
 as opposed to be toxic about it.

1:37:47.540 --> 1:37:55.140
 I mean, what people really for a long time have told me that it would be

1:37:55.140 --> 1:37:57.700
 awesome if Ryan Hall goes on Joe Rogan.

1:37:57.700 --> 1:38:00.100
 I definitely think that would be an awesome thing.

1:38:00.100 --> 1:38:02.180
 Have you listened to Joe?

1:38:02.180 --> 1:38:04.900
 Has he been a part of your life in some kind of way?

1:38:04.900 --> 1:38:08.660
 You know, well, Joe's always, I remember watching Joe on Fear Factor when I

1:38:08.660 --> 1:38:09.780
 was a little kid, which is cool.

1:38:09.780 --> 1:38:14.820
 So I've actually gotten to like, from a bird's eye view, watch his kind of

1:38:14.820 --> 1:38:16.180
 just path through life.

1:38:16.180 --> 1:38:19.940
 But one of the things that I always appreciate, and again, I barely know Joe

1:38:19.940 --> 1:38:20.740
 other than to shake his hand.

1:38:20.740 --> 1:38:24.340
 He interviewed me after the, briefly in the ring after the BJ pan fight.

1:38:24.340 --> 1:38:28.820
 But one of the things that I've always admired about Joe is that I think he

1:38:28.820 --> 1:38:30.100
 had fucking money from the start.

1:38:30.660 --> 1:38:33.460
 I think that zero dollars is fucking money for Joe.

1:38:33.460 --> 1:38:37.940
 I think, and that's something I respect about him a great deal because as you

1:38:37.940 --> 1:38:42.660
 say, it's interesting to watch, it's like you hope that George St. Pierre is

1:38:42.660 --> 1:38:42.980
 like this.

1:38:42.980 --> 1:38:46.260
 It's really, I'm not super close to George, but we're teammates at TriStar

1:38:46.260 --> 1:38:47.700
 and he's never been anything but a gentleman.

1:38:47.700 --> 1:38:50.900
 He's one of those people that if you didn't know George was famous when you

1:38:50.900 --> 1:38:52.340
 walk into the gym, you'd have no idea.

1:38:52.340 --> 1:38:53.860
 He's not holding court, not doing it.

1:38:53.860 --> 1:38:56.740
 He's just, you know, training and he'll help out an amateur doing this.

1:38:56.740 --> 1:38:58.180
 If you have a question for him, he'll help me.

1:38:58.180 --> 1:38:58.900
 Like I'm nobody, man.

1:38:59.460 --> 1:39:01.140
 He would give me advice and train me.

1:39:01.140 --> 1:39:02.180
 It was super cool.

1:39:02.180 --> 1:39:04.020
 And he didn't kill me, which I really appreciated.

1:39:04.020 --> 1:39:05.140
 He's a gentleman.

1:39:05.140 --> 1:39:09.860
 But you know, it's like you meet someone and you go, man, it's so cool that

1:39:09.860 --> 1:39:13.940
 this is the guy who's the best, that this is the guy who has been successful.

1:39:13.940 --> 1:39:16.820
 And then you go, why are they successful?

1:39:16.820 --> 1:39:18.020
 Like I said, true to what they're doing.

1:39:18.020 --> 1:39:18.820
 They haven't changed.

1:39:18.820 --> 1:39:19.700
 They're the same as they've been.

1:39:19.700 --> 1:39:23.540
 And I remember I got to TriStar in 2012 and George was already George St.

1:39:23.540 --> 1:39:25.940
 Pierre, but I remember watching and talking to people and they're like,

1:39:25.940 --> 1:39:27.380
 oh man, George is the same as he's always been.

1:39:27.380 --> 1:39:27.780
 And it's neat.

1:39:27.780 --> 1:39:30.500
 I see him in the gym training now and again, giving advice now.

1:39:30.500 --> 1:39:33.220
 And it seems like Joe has always been consistent.

1:39:33.220 --> 1:39:37.620
 And it's neat to watch someone not compromise on their values and not change

1:39:37.620 --> 1:39:38.100
 who they are.

1:39:38.100 --> 1:39:40.740
 And not, you know, periodically, like, you know, again, we all make mistakes.

1:39:40.740 --> 1:39:42.340
 Like you have a bad day or this or that.

1:39:42.340 --> 1:39:45.380
 And an apology needs to be issued or even my bad or this or that.

1:39:45.380 --> 1:39:48.420
 And you're like, yeah, and they just move on that they're not afraid to be

1:39:48.420 --> 1:39:50.660
 themselves and they're not afraid to be wrong.

1:39:50.660 --> 1:39:51.940
 They're not afraid to make a mistake.

1:39:51.940 --> 1:39:54.900
 As you mentioned, open mind and some like, so what are the correct beliefs to

1:39:54.900 --> 1:39:57.780
 have about this that I know going in, everyone's going to be okay with what

1:39:57.780 --> 1:40:00.180
 I'm saying, which is usually the beginning of a conversation that's

1:40:00.180 --> 1:40:00.900
 going to go nowhere.

1:40:00.900 --> 1:40:01.540
 Right.

1:40:01.540 --> 1:40:07.380
 And, uh, it's, it's neat to see, um, the things I guess that he's created on

1:40:07.380 --> 1:40:10.740
 his own as a result of the authenticity that's there.

1:40:10.740 --> 1:40:12.420
 And it reminds me of like Dave Chappelle.

1:40:12.420 --> 1:40:15.460
 And, and again, I don't know, I've never met Dave, but it's neat to see

1:40:15.460 --> 1:40:20.340
 someone that's clearly again, authentic in their own way, doing their own

1:40:20.340 --> 1:40:20.740
 thing.

1:40:20.740 --> 1:40:24.020
 And they're because of that, they're above the corporate nonsense.

1:40:24.020 --> 1:40:27.460
 But what's funny, I think the message behind all of it is, Hey guys, we

1:40:27.460 --> 1:40:30.820
 all are, I can't promise you that I'm going to have money.

1:40:30.820 --> 1:40:32.500
 Joe couldn't promise you that he's going to have money.

1:40:32.500 --> 1:40:37.540
 Now it ended up working out, but he was above that nonsense from the jump.

1:40:38.180 --> 1:40:41.300
 And he just continued to be above it by never giving it any mind and just

1:40:41.300 --> 1:40:42.900
 going like, yeah, I'm going to be a reasonable person.

1:40:42.900 --> 1:40:43.860
 I'm going to try to learn.

1:40:43.860 --> 1:40:45.140
 I'm going to try to grow.

1:40:45.140 --> 1:40:48.820
 And, uh, if I say something annoying, you can come and talk to me about it.

1:40:48.820 --> 1:40:49.780
 We can get to the bottom of it.

1:40:49.780 --> 1:40:52.740
 And I'm like, if I need to say my bad, thanks, appreciate it.

1:40:52.740 --> 1:40:53.300
 You know, I will.

1:40:53.300 --> 1:40:55.620
 And if I don't need to, I'm like, Hey, I still appreciate the talk.

1:40:55.620 --> 1:40:56.100
 Thanks man.

1:40:56.100 --> 1:40:58.500
 I'll shake your hand and we'd carry on and we'd go our separate ways and

1:40:58.500 --> 1:40:59.860
 hopefully I'll treat you with respect.

1:40:59.860 --> 1:41:02.420
 You treat me with respect and that's about it.

1:41:02.420 --> 1:41:06.260
 And I guess I think it's a lesson that it can work out no matter what you

1:41:06.260 --> 1:41:08.900
 don't have to count out to like these weird powers that be.

1:41:09.780 --> 1:41:13.620
 And whether you're at this level or at this level, but you can live your

1:41:13.620 --> 1:41:14.580
 life the way that you want.

1:41:14.580 --> 1:41:16.900
 And as you mentioned, talk to your friends, hang out, be happy.

1:41:16.900 --> 1:41:18.740
 And it just so happens that that resonates with people.

1:41:18.740 --> 1:41:22.180
 It actually reminds me of like, uh, speaking to MIT and being in Boston is

1:41:22.180 --> 1:41:23.540
 like a good will hunting.

1:41:23.540 --> 1:41:25.940
 You know, like, again, that's what did he really want to do?

1:41:25.940 --> 1:41:26.740
 He could have gone this way.

1:41:26.740 --> 1:41:27.620
 Could have gone that way.

1:41:27.620 --> 1:41:31.380
 And it was an interesting story, but it's like this person wants to hang out

1:41:31.380 --> 1:41:33.380
 with his buddies and wants to do other things.

1:41:33.380 --> 1:41:35.940
 And again, it happens to be brilliant and happens to be able to do all these

1:41:35.940 --> 1:41:37.700
 other things, but there was.

1:41:38.660 --> 1:41:41.940
 I guess it's like, at least in my mind, a story of authenticity as well.

1:41:41.940 --> 1:41:44.580
 And it was both the same thing in the Robin Williams character.

1:41:44.580 --> 1:41:49.140
 And I just think that that's a message cause watch watching things occur on

1:41:49.140 --> 1:41:50.500
 the internet as they do now.

1:41:50.500 --> 1:41:52.660
 Think so many things playing out in the public eye.

1:41:52.660 --> 1:41:56.180
 I feel like so many private or otherwise formerly private discussions and

1:41:56.180 --> 1:42:00.980
 disputes and, and, you know, interactions now become, they all have a, a, well,

1:42:00.980 --> 1:42:02.740
 what is this going to say when it goes public?

1:42:02.740 --> 1:42:04.340
 So how can I couch what I'm saying?

1:42:04.340 --> 1:42:07.220
 Or how can I word this in a way that's going to get people on my side or use

1:42:07.220 --> 1:42:09.540
 the right buzzwords and not use the wrong buzzwords.

1:42:09.540 --> 1:42:10.980
 And it's just neat to see people.

1:42:11.860 --> 1:42:14.820
 You know, in their own way, flip the bird to the head, because I just think

1:42:14.820 --> 1:42:18.340
 that that's, that's just not how a human being is meant to think or interact.

1:42:18.340 --> 1:42:27.060
 I'm curious what you think about the thing that recently has, you know, me like

1:42:27.060 --> 1:42:32.580
 hosting this podcast, I sometimes think about like, who should I talk to and not

1:42:33.860 --> 1:42:39.380
 in terms of like, it's the, the old Hitler question now, Hitler, I would definitely

1:42:39.380 --> 1:42:43.940
 talk to because post world war II, because everyone knows he's evil.

1:42:43.940 --> 1:42:51.220
 The question, whether you talk to Hitler in 1937, like when people who are really

1:42:51.220 --> 1:42:56.020
 students of what's going on, understand that this is a very dangerous human being.

1:42:57.700 --> 1:43:02.820
 But a large number of the part of the world are like, well, he's a leader who

1:43:02.820 --> 1:43:03.700
 cares for Germany.

1:43:04.260 --> 1:43:09.220
 So the question I have, it's interesting to me, it involves a particular person

1:43:09.220 --> 1:43:13.140
 named who also lives in Austin, Texas named Alex Jones.

1:43:13.140 --> 1:43:14.500
 I don't know if you're familiar with the guy.

1:43:14.500 --> 1:43:16.020
 I am familiar with Mr. Jones.

1:43:17.780 --> 1:43:23.700
 I've actually recently just listened to Infowars, like one episode of his show,

1:43:23.700 --> 1:43:25.060
 I guess that he does every day.

1:43:25.780 --> 1:43:31.060
 And it kind of reminds me of a time in college when I drank too much tequila.

1:43:32.660 --> 1:43:33.860
 There's no turning back.

1:43:33.860 --> 1:43:41.300
 Like, it's like, like the mistakes you make that like, it's, I mean, you don't

1:43:41.300 --> 1:43:45.620
 know where you're going to wake up, you don't know who you're going to kill or

1:43:45.620 --> 1:43:49.700
 not kill or steal or rob, it's unclear.

1:43:49.700 --> 1:43:55.460
 So that, it felt like I was getting pulled into a dark place where pretty

1:43:55.460 --> 1:43:59.860
 much everybody is a pedophile that's trying to control the world.

1:44:00.740 --> 1:44:02.980
 So Bill Gates definitely is a pedophile.

1:44:04.260 --> 1:44:08.260
 Everybody in power, anybody in power, there's a kind of a deep skepticism

1:44:08.260 --> 1:44:14.580
 about power and a conspiratorial way to see the world where everything is

1:44:14.580 --> 1:44:17.620
 like dark forces in all corners.

1:44:17.620 --> 1:44:20.980
 It's like the way you feel when you're a kid, that there's a monster hiding

1:44:20.980 --> 1:44:21.860
 in the closet.

1:44:21.860 --> 1:44:24.980
 Which is also why you leap over the bed from like four feet away.

1:44:24.980 --> 1:44:26.100
 There's a strategy.

1:44:26.100 --> 1:44:26.500
 Yes.

1:44:26.500 --> 1:44:28.740
 So, but he says that you're just being weak.

1:44:28.740 --> 1:44:30.180
 You need to look under the bed.

1:44:30.180 --> 1:44:33.460
 Under the bed, there's monsters and we need to be aware of them because

1:44:33.460 --> 1:44:35.380
 they're growing, they're multiplying.

1:44:35.380 --> 1:44:36.260
 You should be.

1:44:36.260 --> 1:44:37.380
 And they're touching children.

1:44:37.380 --> 1:44:38.580
 They're touching children.

1:44:38.580 --> 1:44:39.460
 Exactly.

1:44:39.460 --> 1:44:40.820
 So it all connects.

1:44:40.820 --> 1:44:46.020
 But the, the, I, when I listened to him and I thought about like, do I want

1:44:46.020 --> 1:44:52.580
 to talk to him on this podcast, for example, when I listened to his

1:44:52.580 --> 1:44:56.660
 conversation with Joe Rogan, the two times he talked on there, to me,

1:44:56.660 --> 1:44:59.540
 it was somehow entertaining.

1:44:59.540 --> 1:45:01.860
 Like it was fun to listen to.

1:45:01.860 --> 1:45:08.020
 It's fun to listen to a madman go on for four hours because it's almost

1:45:08.020 --> 1:45:08.740
 like theater.

1:45:10.420 --> 1:45:12.340
 Like, this is what I talked to Joe about.

1:45:13.460 --> 1:45:18.660
 When people try to censor Alex Jones, Joe says that the people who try

1:45:18.660 --> 1:45:22.900
 to censor him don't give enough credit to the intelligence of human

1:45:22.900 --> 1:45:28.580
 beings to like, understand like that, like what a person says on a

1:45:28.580 --> 1:45:32.420
 large platform does not necessarily is not the truth.

1:45:32.420 --> 1:45:36.740
 You can be a madman and say crazy things and people are intelligent

1:45:36.740 --> 1:45:42.660
 enough to hear certain things being, when they're said like the earth

1:45:42.660 --> 1:45:46.820
 is flat, they can, they can be intelligent enough not to all of a

1:45:46.820 --> 1:45:49.460
 sudden start believing that the earth is flat.

1:45:49.460 --> 1:45:53.140
 Like they, they're intelligent enough to sort of select different

1:45:53.140 --> 1:45:57.460
 ideas and be able to enjoy the theater of a particular ridiculous

1:45:57.460 --> 1:46:01.220
 over the top conversation without being sort of influenced to where

1:46:01.220 --> 1:46:04.260
 they start believing like toxic set of beliefs.

1:46:05.060 --> 1:46:11.860
 Now there's a lot of sort of other kinds of people, especially now

1:46:11.860 --> 1:46:14.660
 with cancel culture that say, well, you don't want to give platform

1:46:14.660 --> 1:46:20.020
 to crazy people that ultimately whose beliefs might lead to dangerous

1:46:20.020 --> 1:46:20.900
 consequences.

1:46:20.900 --> 1:46:25.060
 Like, and I see it very often now with conspiracy theories that go,

1:46:25.060 --> 1:46:26.980
 that go like way too far.

1:46:26.980 --> 1:46:32.580
 Like for example, would, I, I'm not, I haven't looked into it, so I'm

1:46:32.580 --> 1:46:40.740
 sorry, I will look into it, but it hurts my heart to see that on Bill

1:46:40.740 --> 1:46:46.580
 Gates, in my opinion, the person who has saved and improved more lives

1:46:46.580 --> 1:46:51.460
 than probably any human history, literally because of the money he's

1:46:51.460 --> 1:46:55.540
 invested in helping, like just, just the work he's done on like malaria

1:46:55.780 --> 1:46:59.140
 in Africa, the number of people he's helped is huge.

1:46:59.620 --> 1:47:04.900
 And yet every interview, anything you see now on Bill Gates, everyone

1:47:04.900 --> 1:47:08.740
 is calling him, I believe haven't looked into it, but I believe

1:47:08.740 --> 1:47:10.020
 everyone's calling him a pedophile.

1:47:10.020 --> 1:47:14.500
 I don't know the full structure of it, but it's, it's just a very, it

1:47:14.500 --> 1:47:18.100
 feels like an army of like, it feels like it's hundreds of thousands

1:47:18.100 --> 1:47:18.580
 of people.

1:47:18.580 --> 1:47:19.460
 That's what it feels like.

1:47:19.460 --> 1:47:23.060
 It might be a much smaller percentage, but it feels like a huge number

1:47:23.060 --> 1:47:24.340
 of people are calling him a pedophile.

1:47:24.340 --> 1:47:26.260
 So that's the, that's the flip side.

1:47:26.260 --> 1:47:29.620
 If you allow, if you give platform to conspiracy theories like that,

1:47:30.180 --> 1:47:33.380
 then you start to have bigger and bigger percent of the population

1:47:33.380 --> 1:47:34.660
 believe in these crazy things.

1:47:35.140 --> 1:47:37.700
 I just, I wanted to put it out there.

1:47:37.700 --> 1:47:39.780
 Cause I don't know what to think of that.

1:47:40.500 --> 1:47:43.860
 If you put yourself in Joe Rogan's shoes, if you put yourself in my

1:47:43.860 --> 1:47:47.940
 shoes, if you put yourself just in your own shoes, I mean, I'm even

1:47:47.940 --> 1:47:49.620
 I'm in my shoes right now.

1:47:49.620 --> 1:47:49.860
 Great.

1:47:49.860 --> 1:47:51.700
 If you're staying in your shoes, just stay in your shoes.

1:47:51.700 --> 1:47:57.780
 Can I have your, would you talk, would you give platform to people like

1:47:57.780 --> 1:48:05.220
 Alex Jones, would, would you talk to somebody like Alex Jones or, or not?

1:48:05.940 --> 1:48:07.300
 Uh, I, yes, I would.

1:48:07.300 --> 1:48:09.140
 And I feel very strongly about this, honestly.

1:48:09.700 --> 1:48:14.260
 Um, well, I think that it's, it's an interesting thing and I, I would

1:48:14.260 --> 1:48:18.100
 just say a lot of times, um, I can understand, you know, very, very

1:48:18.260 --> 1:48:23.620
 clearly why people would take issue with the idea of, I guess what they

1:48:23.620 --> 1:48:28.260
 proceed to be amplifying this man's voice, this man's reach, um, you

1:48:28.260 --> 1:48:30.740
 know, as, as a demonstrable negative.

1:48:30.740 --> 1:48:37.060
 But I think, um, you know, when you take a step back further, uh, the,

1:48:37.060 --> 1:48:40.900
 the cure is more damaging than the disease and significantly.

1:48:40.900 --> 1:48:47.780
 So, um, I guess I think that I'm very, very wary of, I think being where

1:48:47.780 --> 1:48:51.620
 you mentioned Alex Jones being wary of power and people with it, that's

1:48:51.860 --> 1:48:56.820
 a lot of times there's a lot of truth and validity to crazy things that

1:48:56.820 --> 1:49:01.700
 people say it's the conspiracy theories that stick are the ones that sound

1:49:01.700 --> 1:49:04.980
 credible, at least quasi credible in some aspect.

1:49:05.140 --> 1:49:07.620
 And it's almost like it seems to me like an anchor in people's mind.

1:49:07.620 --> 1:49:11.540
 And it is also funny to me, obviously the, the Bill Gates, it's so funny

1:49:11.540 --> 1:49:15.700
 to tar people with things like pedophile, racist, rapist, like, these

1:49:15.700 --> 1:49:18.660
 are things that we're basically trying to pick words that no one can ever

1:49:18.660 --> 1:49:20.260
 support someone who does these things.

1:49:20.740 --> 1:49:24.580
 And that's, you know, and that changes year by year.

1:49:24.580 --> 1:49:30.660
 Like currently pedophile is totally in as a thing to call somebody just,

1:49:30.660 --> 1:49:35.140
 just as a, it used to be communist or Marxist Cleveland Browns fan, you

1:49:35.140 --> 1:49:38.580
 know, like, come on, you know, actually nobody likes the Browns.

1:49:38.580 --> 1:49:39.380
 So I'll agree with you.

1:49:39.380 --> 1:49:40.580
 That was, that's why I picked them.

1:49:40.580 --> 1:49:43.380
 That's the trick is you find a group of people that nobody likes.

1:49:43.380 --> 1:49:44.260
 We're good here.

1:49:44.420 --> 1:49:44.740
 All right.

1:49:44.740 --> 1:49:47.940
 That's the move, but, uh, yeah, that's a creepy thing though, because

1:49:48.100 --> 1:49:52.020
 that is, that is the creepy thing is like, if people are always looking

1:49:52.020 --> 1:49:54.340
 for groups of people are always looking for, and I find this really deeply

1:49:54.340 --> 1:49:58.340
 disturbing, um, like, Hey, so who's the guy that we can all get away with?

1:49:58.660 --> 1:50:02.580
 You know, just treating like dirt, who's the guy that I can be a dick to?

1:50:02.580 --> 1:50:05.140
 I can just walk up and punch in the face and no one's going to say anything.

1:50:05.380 --> 1:50:09.860
 And it's, even if I, you know, people do that with, whether it's literal

1:50:09.860 --> 1:50:13.940
 Nazis or someone that I called a Nazi, you know, I guess what's the bigger issue,

1:50:13.940 --> 1:50:16.980
 this person's ridiculous beliefs or what I'm doing.

1:50:17.380 --> 1:50:21.060
 And you mentioned Hitler before, and obviously Mein Kampf being a, you know,

1:50:21.140 --> 1:50:24.980
 like the outline for some of the things he did later and when the evil was it

1:50:24.980 --> 1:50:28.980
 always there, did it, did it take root later on or flourish later on?

1:50:28.980 --> 1:50:34.020
 But was, was Adolf Hitler a problem because he had crazy ideas or

1:50:34.020 --> 1:50:35.140
 because he did things?

1:50:35.620 --> 1:50:38.980
 I think it's because it's not, I think I know it's because he did things.

1:50:38.980 --> 1:50:43.060
 Now, if I'm going to start punishing thought crime, I, I'm going to have to

1:50:43.060 --> 1:50:44.340
 start punishing thought crime.

1:50:44.340 --> 1:50:45.860
 And that's a terrifying concept.

1:50:46.100 --> 1:50:49.380
 Even if I'm right about the certain, about the objectively correct about the

1:50:49.380 --> 1:50:53.220
 things that I decide to call out of bounds, who put me in charge and made me

1:50:53.220 --> 1:50:58.420
 arbiter of good taste and how long until I did it, did it, did it, did it, did it

1:50:58.420 --> 1:51:01.940
 long until I decide that something else is, is out of bounds.

1:51:01.940 --> 1:51:04.980
 It's, it's always a sliding scale or it's always a sliding standard.

1:51:05.220 --> 1:51:09.620
 And I find that, that, you know, to be more of a concern than people doing

1:51:09.620 --> 1:51:12.500
 crazy things, because I guess if you mentioned Alex Jones, you know, putting

1:51:12.500 --> 1:51:16.260
 out ridiculous, ridiculous ideas, ridiculous theories, I think that most

1:51:16.260 --> 1:51:18.580
 people don't look at Alex Jones as a credible person.

1:51:18.820 --> 1:51:22.100
 Now I'm not going to pretend to be deeply read into all of his beliefs or the

1:51:22.100 --> 1:51:23.220
 things that he's trying to peddle.

1:51:23.220 --> 1:51:27.860
 Um, but there's plenty of things that are quasi mainstream that I think on

1:51:27.860 --> 1:51:32.820
 with this side or that side that maybe not comparably ridiculous, but are, you

1:51:32.820 --> 1:51:36.820
 know, particularly in hindsight or, you know, or we're not, or, or silly.

1:51:37.140 --> 1:51:42.740
 And I guess, uh, the idea of, of getting a group of people together to decide

1:51:42.740 --> 1:51:46.180
 what we're not going to tolerate is a very, very tricky thing.

1:51:46.180 --> 1:51:51.700
 And I think that, you know, it reminds me of law or, you know, even, you

1:51:51.700 --> 1:51:54.420
 know, religion when it gets to like, what are the things that we don't like?

1:51:54.420 --> 1:51:56.420
 How do we feel about rape?

1:51:56.420 --> 1:51:58.180
 It's like, no, under no circumstances.

1:51:58.220 --> 1:52:00.180
 Is that an acceptable behavior murder?

1:52:00.580 --> 1:52:01.860
 No, that's not acceptable behavior.

1:52:01.860 --> 1:52:05.300
 Killing, I don't know, kind of depends on the situation.

1:52:05.300 --> 1:52:06.100
 Are you at war?

1:52:06.100 --> 1:52:06.980
 Were you justified?

1:52:06.980 --> 1:52:08.340
 Were you acting in self defense?

1:52:09.060 --> 1:52:09.300
 Okay.

1:52:09.300 --> 1:52:14.660
 So it's not now murder is a specific type of killing the same way, you know, other

1:52:14.660 --> 1:52:16.180
 things should be a specific type of something else.

1:52:16.180 --> 1:52:17.700
 But I guess we, we draw the line of murder.

1:52:17.700 --> 1:52:20.340
 We say, if you want to exist in our society, you can't do this.

1:52:20.340 --> 1:52:21.460
 This cannot be done.

1:52:21.700 --> 1:52:23.140
 And then we go theft.

1:52:23.140 --> 1:52:24.900
 If someone said, Hey, I murdered that guy.

1:52:24.900 --> 1:52:26.260
 Can you understand where I'm coming from?

1:52:26.260 --> 1:52:27.460
 I might say, yeah, I'll hear you out.

1:52:27.540 --> 1:52:30.740
 It doesn't mean that I think you're right, but I'm like, have you ever been wronged

1:52:30.740 --> 1:52:33.460
 so deeply that you could imagine that you could kill someone?

1:52:33.460 --> 1:52:36.020
 I'm like, no, I haven't, but I could conceptualize someone doing that.

1:52:36.020 --> 1:52:37.460
 And I'm like, yeah, okay.

1:52:37.460 --> 1:52:40.580
 And you still need to go, you still need to face, you know, criminal justice as we

1:52:40.580 --> 1:52:42.740
 have it in our system, or at least that's how we've decided.

1:52:43.300 --> 1:52:44.580
 Yeah, there's, it's interesting.

1:52:44.580 --> 1:52:48.980
 You have to be able to like, there's, if you look at the history of discourse in

1:52:48.980 --> 1:52:55.380
 this country, I think it's still true, but I'm not sure it's changed since 9 11 is,

1:52:55.380 --> 1:53:02.180
 uh, it used to be impossible to criticize, um, a soldier.

1:53:03.220 --> 1:53:05.140
 It was easier to criticize war.

1:53:05.140 --> 1:53:09.940
 It was harder to criticize soldiers for allowing themselves to be the tools of war.

1:53:10.260 --> 1:53:13.220
 I tend to be, maybe it's the Russian upbringing.

1:53:13.220 --> 1:53:15.380
 It's the, it's the combat thing.

1:53:15.380 --> 1:53:19.300
 I tend to romanticize war and soldiers.

1:53:19.300 --> 1:53:26.420
 I see soldiers as heroes, but I've also heard people that not only say that soldiers

1:53:26.420 --> 1:53:28.260
 are, uh, war is bad.

1:53:28.740 --> 1:53:30.740
 They say soldiers are bad.

1:53:31.620 --> 1:53:32.580
 What's their argument?

1:53:33.060 --> 1:53:41.220
 It's, it's the kind of a libertarian view that they're basically slaves to evil, right?

1:53:41.220 --> 1:53:49.700
 War is evil and they're, they're given, they are suspending their moral and ethical, like,

1:53:49.700 --> 1:53:53.540
 as like duties as a human being to become the tools of evil.

1:53:53.540 --> 1:53:55.060
 That's the sort of the argument.

1:53:55.060 --> 1:54:01.780
 If you see war as evil, I mean, I think it's useful to hear that, but there's for a long

1:54:02.500 --> 1:54:05.140
 part in history that was completely unacceptable.

1:54:05.940 --> 1:54:08.020
 Same with abortion.

1:54:08.020 --> 1:54:16.660
 If you see abortion as murder, I mean, if I classify it in that, if I put it in that,

1:54:16.660 --> 1:54:23.220
 in that basket, it starts, we're living in the midst of like a genocide.

1:54:25.220 --> 1:54:29.220
 Looked at from that perspective, could you feel how people could be deeply upset by abortion?

1:54:29.220 --> 1:54:29.940
 You go, of course.

1:54:29.940 --> 1:54:32.980
 Looked at from a different perspective, you say, I don't believe it to be murder.

1:54:32.980 --> 1:54:34.340
 That's not how I see it.

1:54:34.340 --> 1:54:37.780
 Then you go, oh, well, if that's the genesis of your, your thought process, then you're

1:54:37.780 --> 1:54:38.340
 like, yeah, okay.

1:54:38.340 --> 1:54:43.060
 Now, now I see how we can come to a different thing, but I guess we go, well, abortion is

1:54:43.060 --> 1:54:44.100
 murder period.

1:54:44.100 --> 1:54:47.140
 Therefore, if you support it, you support murder.

1:54:47.140 --> 1:54:49.060
 That's a convenient way for me to tar you.

1:54:49.060 --> 1:54:49.460
 Right.

1:54:49.460 --> 1:54:52.420
 But I guess that's kind of coming back to the Alec Jones.

1:54:52.420 --> 1:54:54.420
 I'm, I'm just a nuance.

1:54:54.420 --> 1:54:58.100
 It's a, you have to have the nuance in these kinds of conversations and I have to be willing

1:54:58.100 --> 1:55:00.420
 to have the conversation and I have to be willing to sit down.

1:55:00.420 --> 1:55:05.940
 If I can't sit down across from like the most violently racist, angry, hypothetical internet,

1:55:05.940 --> 1:55:10.020
 you know, conceived person that none of us have ever actually met in real life, but are

1:55:10.020 --> 1:55:14.980
 hopefully not, you know, and go like, well, of course I believe that this person's wrong,

1:55:14.980 --> 1:55:16.900
 but allow me to change, do my best.

1:55:16.900 --> 1:55:19.860
 I'll hear them out and I'll go, no, I can go point by point and explain where this guy

1:55:19.860 --> 1:55:23.620
 or this girl is wrong and hopefully bring them over to a more reasonable position where

1:55:23.620 --> 1:55:27.700
 they will have better beliefs and they will like objectively better beliefs and beliefs

1:55:27.700 --> 1:55:30.420
 that will, will, and they'll treat other people better.

1:55:30.420 --> 1:55:32.020
 Why would I want to marginalize this person?

1:55:32.020 --> 1:55:32.980
 I might not want to talk.

1:55:32.980 --> 1:55:36.180
 I might not want to invite them to my barbecue if they're acting like a jerk all the time,

1:55:36.180 --> 1:55:39.620
 but how could I, would it not make the world a better place if I'd hear them out and they

1:55:39.620 --> 1:55:41.860
 go, look, if you're going to sit down and talk with me, we're going to have to have

1:55:41.860 --> 1:55:42.660
 a discussion.

1:55:42.660 --> 1:55:44.020
 I'll hear what you have to say.

1:55:44.020 --> 1:55:50.020
 And if I can't, if I can't explain to someone why their ridiculous belief is wrong, then

1:55:50.020 --> 1:55:52.500
 I might, I must not be so confident in my position.

1:55:52.500 --> 1:55:54.580
 And I guess that's where I come back to the Alex Jones thing.

1:55:54.580 --> 1:55:58.980
 As you mentioned, you know, with, with Bill Gates and, and you're much more familiar with,

1:55:58.980 --> 1:56:02.660
 with the specifics of all the good that he's done, but you know, again, he's been an unbelievable

1:56:02.660 --> 1:56:04.660
 force for good, you know, in this world.

1:56:05.380 --> 1:56:11.380
 You can list A, B, C, D things that the man has, has done, that his foundation has done

1:56:11.380 --> 1:56:13.220
 and, you know, positive things.

1:56:13.220 --> 1:56:18.740
 And then the other people could speculate about ridiculous, crazy levels of, of evil,

1:56:18.740 --> 1:56:21.140
 but you can't produce any evidence for that sort of thing.

1:56:21.140 --> 1:56:23.780
 Because if you could, the man will find himself in some trouble, you know?

1:56:23.780 --> 1:56:29.780
 And anyway, I guess what I would, would say is that why you can't force me to accept the

1:56:29.780 --> 1:56:33.140
 truth the same way you could write down two plus two equals four on a piece of paper and

1:56:33.140 --> 1:56:33.940
 show me how it works.

1:56:33.940 --> 1:56:36.500
 And I could say, no, but that doesn't make it not true.

1:56:36.500 --> 1:56:38.980
 And you've still given yourself an opportunity to present your case.

1:56:38.980 --> 1:56:40.260
 You've presented it to me.

1:56:40.260 --> 1:56:44.420
 And you've also, for anyone listening and watching, you know, you've been able to critically

1:56:45.060 --> 1:56:48.980
 assess what's gone on, you know, or critically address back and forth, you know, kind of

1:56:48.980 --> 1:56:50.100
 the, the discourse.

1:56:50.100 --> 1:56:52.500
 And I think that you almost, you're making your case for the public.

1:56:52.500 --> 1:56:57.860
 So I guess like, you know, when it comes to just never not engaging with these people,

1:56:57.860 --> 1:56:59.220
 that seems to me to be cowardly.

1:56:59.220 --> 1:57:02.900
 And I think that that's a, something that we're seeing in society right now, I think

1:57:02.900 --> 1:57:06.820
 we're seeing a crisis of courage in society all over the place.

1:57:06.820 --> 1:57:09.140
 And I think that's where we're seeing poor leadership.

1:57:09.140 --> 1:57:13.620
 I think we're seeing understandable things happening everywhere, but we need stronger

1:57:13.620 --> 1:57:18.180
 voices and stronger, stronger beliefs that have a conviction and are willing to engage

1:57:18.180 --> 1:57:22.020
 with others, not just turning into a shouting contest and not, I didn't win because there's

1:57:22.020 --> 1:57:22.420
 more of me.

1:57:22.420 --> 1:57:23.940
 Oh, I voted, I outvoted you.

1:57:23.940 --> 1:57:24.820
 That's nice too.

1:57:24.820 --> 1:57:26.260
 But that's a stand in for bullets.

1:57:26.260 --> 1:57:27.940
 That's saying I won because there's more of me.

1:57:27.940 --> 1:57:32.260
 That doesn't mean that I'm right because plenty of horrible and unpopular now things have

1:57:32.260 --> 1:57:35.460
 been very, very deeply popular in the past and would have won a popular vote.

1:57:35.460 --> 1:57:36.820
 Does that make them right?

1:57:36.820 --> 1:57:38.180
 I'd say clearly not.

1:57:38.180 --> 1:57:42.420
 So I guess you'd hope that we engage with these people and that you can do your best

1:57:42.420 --> 1:57:45.540
 to bring them over to a more reasonable position if you believe that you have one.

1:57:45.540 --> 1:57:47.540
 And if you can't, well, at least you made the effort.

1:57:47.540 --> 1:57:50.100
 And I think that that's something where martial arts shows the value.

1:57:50.100 --> 1:57:52.180
 It's like, do you know if you're going to go win your next fight?

1:57:52.180 --> 1:57:53.460
 I'm like, I have no idea.

1:57:53.460 --> 1:57:58.420
 I will proceed forward with full effort and I will fight with dignity.

1:57:58.420 --> 1:58:02.500
 I'll fight with honor and I'll fight with courage and I'll use everything that I have

1:58:02.500 --> 1:58:05.300
 and I will play within the bounds of the game and that's that.

1:58:05.300 --> 1:58:06.660
 And the result will be what it'll be.

1:58:06.660 --> 1:58:09.860
 But I'll walk into and out of that ring with my head held high because I will know that

1:58:09.860 --> 1:58:10.580
 I did my part.

1:58:10.580 --> 1:58:11.620
 I did my job.

1:58:11.620 --> 1:58:14.500
 The outcome, the specific outcome is not in my control.

1:58:14.500 --> 1:58:16.340
 It's just strongly in my influence.

1:58:16.340 --> 1:58:20.340
 And I think that that's something that helped me, that martial arts has taught me because

1:58:20.340 --> 1:58:25.140
 other times, even when I was successful or unsuccessful, I would focus on if I won, I

1:58:25.140 --> 1:58:26.260
 won, therefore I'm good.

1:58:26.260 --> 1:58:27.540
 I lost, therefore I'm bad.

1:58:27.540 --> 1:58:31.460
 This other guy won or lost, therefore, as opposed to evaluating their method.

1:58:31.460 --> 1:58:35.300
 And I think it's so easy when we're taking a bird's eye view of things to not evaluate

1:58:35.300 --> 1:58:36.340
 how someone's doing things.

1:58:36.340 --> 1:58:38.020
 You're not evaluating my process.

1:58:38.020 --> 1:58:39.460
 You're simply evaluating my outcome.

1:58:39.460 --> 1:58:42.740
 And I could have stumbled into something very, very good or very, very bad.

1:58:42.740 --> 1:58:44.660
 And we can look back and I think that's the value of history.

1:58:44.660 --> 1:58:47.780
 I mean, I don't mean to get on my dang high horse, but it's like this value of history

1:58:47.780 --> 1:58:51.700
 is we can see the unbroken chain or the chain of events that led us somewhere.

1:58:51.700 --> 1:58:55.700
 And then only with the eyes of history can we truly evaluate things unless we're in

1:58:55.700 --> 1:58:57.380
 the room watching it happen.

1:58:57.380 --> 1:59:02.820
 And I guess that's, again, where we start to go most of the big, bad, scary things that

1:59:02.820 --> 1:59:08.420
 have happened in history that are done particularly on an industrial scale, which implies governmental

1:59:08.420 --> 1:59:12.980
 power and things like that or the equivalent, involve groups of people getting together

1:59:12.980 --> 1:59:16.100
 and going, hey, we're not going to deal with that guy, giant groups of people.

1:59:16.100 --> 1:59:20.100
 So maybe we're right this time, but maybe we're wrong next time.

1:59:20.100 --> 1:59:22.980
 And I guess I would be back to the Gandalf putting on the one ring.

1:59:22.980 --> 1:59:26.820
 I would be very, very hesitant, even if we thought we were in the right to simply try

1:59:26.820 --> 1:59:30.180
 to try to marginalize just on general principle.

1:59:30.180 --> 1:59:33.860
 Even people like Alex Jones, whom on their face are pretty ridiculous.

1:59:33.860 --> 1:59:36.740
 Like you said, you should sit down with Adolf Hitler and talk to the man.

1:59:36.740 --> 1:59:44.420
 I agree with you to play a little devil's advocate is Alex Jones might be a bad example.

1:59:44.420 --> 1:59:48.740
 But if we look at, because he has a face, he is a human, he's a real person.

1:59:48.740 --> 1:59:54.340
 There's also trolls on the internet for Chan.

1:59:55.380 --> 2:00:01.380
 The worry I have with those folks is that, and there might be parallels to martial arts

2:00:01.380 --> 2:00:08.500
 is they practice guerrilla warfare, meaning they don't necessarily want to arrive at the truth.

2:00:09.220 --> 2:00:13.940
 They just always want to cut at the ankles of the powerful.

2:00:13.940 --> 2:00:17.460
 Like they want to always break down the powerful.

2:00:17.460 --> 2:00:22.580
 And even if they, I mean, it's, they turn everything into a game.

2:00:22.580 --> 2:00:25.940
 So they let's see if we can make the world.

2:00:26.660 --> 2:00:30.580
 Let's see if we can make a trend that Bill Gates is a pedophile, right?

2:00:30.580 --> 2:00:31.620
 They make it into a game.

2:00:31.620 --> 2:00:33.460
 They get excited about this game.

2:00:33.460 --> 2:00:34.820
 They see the powerful.

2:00:34.820 --> 2:00:39.220
 Let's see if we can convince that, like, who is the most positive person we can think of.

2:00:39.220 --> 2:00:41.300
 Let's see if we can turn them into evil.

2:00:41.300 --> 2:00:47.700
 And they've tried that with like everybody and it seems to stick and they're good at it.

2:00:47.700 --> 2:00:54.420
 And some would argue, whatever you think about our current president, that he has some elements

2:00:54.420 --> 2:01:00.900
 of that, which is he's figured out whatever this music of social discourse that's going on,

2:01:00.900 --> 2:01:07.940
 he's figured out how to always troll the mainstream flow of consciousness.

2:01:07.940 --> 2:01:09.300
 That's the media.

2:01:09.300 --> 2:01:13.780
 He always kind of says stuff that annoys a very large number of people.

2:01:13.780 --> 2:01:19.460
 And he enjoys that because it's like taking the powerful, taking the way things were before.

2:01:19.460 --> 2:01:23.940
 And he like shakes it up by saying the most inappropriate thing, almost on purpose or

2:01:23.940 --> 2:01:25.540
 instinctually and so on.

2:01:25.540 --> 2:01:36.900
 The problem I have with that is that doesn't, the powerful thing there is it brings those

2:01:36.900 --> 2:01:38.020
 in power down a notch.

2:01:38.020 --> 2:01:38.980
 That's a great thing.

2:01:38.980 --> 2:01:46.180
 The negative thing is it doesn't push us closer to a nuanced, careful, rigorous discourse

2:01:46.180 --> 2:01:47.620
 towards truth.

2:01:47.620 --> 2:01:51.140
 It's like showing up to a party and just like starting to yell.

2:01:51.140 --> 2:01:54.100
 It doesn't create a good conversation.

2:01:54.100 --> 2:01:59.140
 It just makes everything into a game where truth doesn't even seem like a thing we can

2:01:59.140 --> 2:02:01.220
 even hope to achieve.

2:02:01.220 --> 2:02:02.020
 That makes sense.

2:02:02.020 --> 2:02:04.740
 And I guess, as you mentioned, we'll come back to another movie because I don't do books

2:02:04.740 --> 2:02:05.380
 and do movies.

2:02:05.380 --> 2:02:07.380
 Some people just want to watch the world burn, right?

2:02:07.380 --> 2:02:13.940
 And I guess there's, that's a creepy, creepy kind of urge that some people have.

2:02:13.940 --> 2:02:16.660
 And then also is some people you're like, hey, would you like to throw a brick through

2:02:16.660 --> 2:02:17.460
 that glass window?

2:02:17.460 --> 2:02:19.060
 You're like, yeah, sure.

2:02:19.060 --> 2:02:23.860
 Like, no, I'm not going to do that because I think about what's going to occur.

2:02:23.860 --> 2:02:27.060
 Like something's going to be hurt, someone's property not going to do it versus, hey, you

2:02:27.060 --> 2:02:27.860
 want to see what will happen?

2:02:27.860 --> 2:02:28.740
 Like, yeah, sure.

2:02:28.740 --> 2:02:33.540
 Kids are always like, I have my son, he grabs Spider Man and drops him on the table.

2:02:33.540 --> 2:02:34.500
 Spider Man fell.

2:02:34.500 --> 2:02:35.940
 Spider Man didn't fall, Sean.

2:02:35.940 --> 2:02:39.780
 Like, he dropped him, you knocked him off the table and he'll grin.

2:02:39.780 --> 2:02:46.340
 And basically, it's an interesting thing, like you said, that these people are appealing

2:02:46.340 --> 2:02:52.420
 to and also almost like the little dog factor of like people do want to watch the powerful

2:02:52.420 --> 2:02:55.220
 get taken down a notch for all the good and the not good of that.

2:02:55.220 --> 2:02:59.940
 Just plenty of people, it seems to me, that have found their way to incredibly high positions.

2:02:59.940 --> 2:03:04.580
 Some have just found themselves there and many, many, many, many, many people, men and

2:03:04.580 --> 2:03:08.100
 women of all backgrounds are brilliant and have worked hard.

2:03:08.100 --> 2:03:11.300
 And yeah, of course, there's luck and there's luck into everything.

2:03:11.300 --> 2:03:16.260
 LeBron James, in spite of being the best basketball player on God's green earth, is fortunate

2:03:16.260 --> 2:03:17.780
 that he didn't get hit by a car.

2:03:17.780 --> 2:03:22.580
 It's fortunate he didn't tear his knee, but thankfully, we get to see all these things.

2:03:22.580 --> 2:03:31.140
 But I guess if people don't have any skin in the game, you never know what they're going

2:03:31.140 --> 2:03:31.380
 to do.

2:03:31.380 --> 2:03:33.140
 And I think that's the problem with the internet.

2:03:33.140 --> 2:03:36.340
 You know, that people get to be nameless, be faceless.

2:03:36.340 --> 2:03:39.300
 That's why guerrilla fighters are outside of the bounds of war.

2:03:39.300 --> 2:03:40.820
 Like you don't have a uniform on.

2:03:40.820 --> 2:03:42.340
 Like, I don't know who you're from.

2:03:42.340 --> 2:03:46.740
 You don't get the same treatment that a soldier gets for MP.

2:03:46.740 --> 2:03:47.540
 Well, that's crazy.

2:03:47.540 --> 2:03:52.260
 Actually, there's reasons for this, because otherwise people are able to assail things

2:03:52.260 --> 2:03:55.220
 and there's no one responsible.

2:03:55.220 --> 2:03:57.540
 There's no way to go and say, hey, where did this come from?

2:03:57.540 --> 2:03:58.340
 What's the root of this?

2:03:58.340 --> 2:03:59.700
 How can I address this?

2:03:59.700 --> 2:04:01.940
 And I think that's the problem of the internet, the problem of Twitter.

2:04:01.940 --> 2:04:03.300
 There's a problem in places like 4chan.

2:04:03.300 --> 2:04:06.580
 I wouldn't mind seeing that type of stuff go away, if I'm frank.

2:04:06.580 --> 2:04:11.540
 But that's not the same thing as people with a face, people who are willing to stand there

2:04:11.540 --> 2:04:13.540
 and say, hi, my name is so and so.

2:04:13.540 --> 2:04:16.420
 Even if I have ridiculous beliefs, hopefully people will hear me out.

2:04:16.420 --> 2:04:18.260
 And then if I'm wrong, educate me.

2:04:18.260 --> 2:04:24.340
 But I guess you hope that the real, I guess, in my mind, antidote to all of this silliness

2:04:24.340 --> 2:04:25.300
 is education.

2:04:25.300 --> 2:04:30.580
 And I think that that's something that we're critical thinking is not necessarily.

2:04:30.580 --> 2:04:33.220
 I went to school in America, and I feel very fortunate.

2:04:33.220 --> 2:04:36.820
 But critical thinking is not something that's focused on.

2:04:36.820 --> 2:04:37.700
 I mean, it's tough.

2:04:37.700 --> 2:04:39.220
 It's almost like talking about jujitsu.

2:04:39.220 --> 2:04:41.460
 It's tough to teach critical thinking when I don't know any words.

2:04:41.460 --> 2:04:42.500
 You have to teach me techniques.

2:04:42.500 --> 2:04:44.100
 You can't teach me to be an artist.

2:04:44.100 --> 2:04:47.220
 But recognize that the techniques are the beginning, not the end.

2:04:47.220 --> 2:04:51.940
 Ultimately, it's the artistry that we are searching for, not just the science or the

2:04:51.940 --> 2:04:53.060
 biro memorization.

2:04:53.060 --> 2:04:58.420
 And I guess you'd hope that people's ability to think critically and recognize that majority

2:04:58.420 --> 2:05:01.940
 rule or whoever's loudest does not mean that they're right by any stretch of the imagination.

2:05:01.940 --> 2:05:02.740
 And we don't appeal to that.

2:05:02.740 --> 2:05:03.620
 And we don't bow to that.

2:05:04.660 --> 2:05:09.140
 We'll help them to help inoculate them against the ridiculous things that come out of these

2:05:09.140 --> 2:05:12.660
 places, these dark places that are objectively not great.

2:05:12.660 --> 2:05:19.300
 But I guess all circling back, even if we swatted these bad things out of existence

2:05:19.300 --> 2:05:25.380
 right now, we've got to be very, very careful doing that because it's who's doing the swatting.

2:05:25.380 --> 2:05:28.980
 This political group that's in power right now, the people that support our current president

2:05:28.980 --> 2:05:30.260
 would maybe feel a certain way.

2:05:30.260 --> 2:05:34.260
 The people that support another option would feel differently as to what exactly defines

2:05:34.260 --> 2:05:34.820
 toxic.

2:05:34.820 --> 2:05:38.980
 And I guess that's what gives me pause.

2:05:38.980 --> 2:05:39.780
 Yeah.

2:05:39.780 --> 2:05:41.380
 But also the grace thing.

2:05:41.380 --> 2:05:48.660
 I tend to believe that the technology, you said education, but the platforms we use like

2:05:48.660 --> 2:05:54.180
 Twitter and Reddit and all these platforms have a role to play to teach us grace.

2:05:54.180 --> 2:06:03.460
 Meaning they should help us incentivize the kind of behavior that is incentivized in real

2:06:03.460 --> 2:06:03.940
 life.

2:06:03.940 --> 2:06:07.460
 Like being a dick in real life is not incentivized.

2:06:07.460 --> 2:06:09.380
 Like one on one interaction.

2:06:09.380 --> 2:06:14.660
 Like there's cases where it is, but usually being kind to each other is incentivized.

2:06:15.300 --> 2:06:16.580
 On the internet, it's not.

2:06:16.580 --> 2:06:22.180
 Like you get likes for mocking people in a funny, in a humorous way.

2:06:22.180 --> 2:06:24.980
 And it can be dark kind of mocking, depending on the community.

2:06:24.980 --> 2:06:27.460
 You can go to the appearance.

2:06:27.460 --> 2:06:32.420
 If somebody is a little fat or a little too skinny, you can comment on their appearance,

2:06:32.420 --> 2:06:36.500
 the hair, the way the hair looks, like the appearance stuff.

2:06:36.500 --> 2:06:43.620
 It could be on the people comment all the time on the level of eloquence of my speech.

2:06:44.420 --> 2:06:45.460
 Go fuck yourself.

2:06:45.460 --> 2:06:46.420
 I like it.

2:06:46.420 --> 2:06:50.420
 It's creepy though watching previously, like this used to be low brow though.

2:06:50.420 --> 2:06:53.700
 Like people doing this type of stuff, it's creepy watching like our political figures

2:06:53.700 --> 2:06:55.540
 get into this type of game.

2:06:56.180 --> 2:06:56.820
 Yes.

2:06:56.820 --> 2:07:00.180
 But again, it's a little bit refreshing, right?

2:07:00.180 --> 2:07:09.460
 It's the, my hope with Donald Trump was, is that he would shake up the people who wear

2:07:09.460 --> 2:07:09.940
 suits.

2:07:09.940 --> 2:07:16.100
 Usually the, like if you're from DC, I remember like showing up, I actually didn't wear what

2:07:16.100 --> 2:07:21.540
 I usually wear in DC cause I was like, everybody's wearing a suit and tie when I was like giving

2:07:21.540 --> 2:07:22.340
 talks and stuff.

2:07:22.340 --> 2:07:24.500
 Except for Mudge, who wears jeans and a t shirt.

2:07:24.500 --> 2:07:25.460
 Mudge doesn't give a damn.

2:07:25.460 --> 2:07:28.900
 Mudge is a forever renegade.

2:07:28.900 --> 2:07:34.260
 But I don't even remember what, oh yeah.

2:07:34.260 --> 2:07:40.900
 So my hope with Trump was that he would shake up that system to say like, to inject new

2:07:40.900 --> 2:07:43.060
 ideas, to inject new energy.

2:07:43.060 --> 2:07:49.300
 Of course, the way it turned out is different, but like there's, it turns out that you might

2:07:49.300 --> 2:07:54.900
 want to have somebody who's like an Andrew Yang type character who is full of ideas that

2:07:54.900 --> 2:08:01.700
 are very different and inject the energy, new energy into the system through youthful

2:08:01.700 --> 2:08:09.300
 new ideas versus through the troll that like, that's very good at sort of mocking and like

2:08:09.300 --> 2:08:12.980
 playing outside the rules of the game.

2:08:12.980 --> 2:08:20.020
 But Trump did reveal powerfully, I don't know what to think of it, that it's just a game

2:08:20.020 --> 2:08:22.260
 and you don't have to play by the rules.

2:08:22.260 --> 2:08:25.620
 That's both inspiring and dark.

2:08:25.620 --> 2:08:26.900
 Deeply depressing, right?

2:08:26.900 --> 2:08:28.980
 Yeah, and I don't know what to do with it.

2:08:28.980 --> 2:08:34.500
 I don't, I mean the same, I'm not drawing parallels, not drawing parallels between our

2:08:34.500 --> 2:08:41.940
 president and Adolf Hitler, but it's certainly, and there's a lot of, in history, a lot of

2:08:41.940 --> 2:08:47.060
 positive and a lot of negative things happen when charismatic leaders realize they don't

2:08:47.060 --> 2:08:48.100
 have to play by the rules.

2:08:49.380 --> 2:08:50.580
 You can just flip the table.

2:08:50.580 --> 2:08:55.140
 It's that Kevin Spacey show.

2:08:55.140 --> 2:08:55.700
 House of Cards.

2:08:55.700 --> 2:08:58.420
 House of Cards, where you just flip the table or whatever.

2:08:58.420 --> 2:09:00.420
 You don't have to play by the rules of the chess game.

2:09:00.420 --> 2:09:01.860
 You can flip the table.

2:09:01.860 --> 2:09:04.580
 One wonders if that's always been done in private, you know?

2:09:04.580 --> 2:09:09.060
 I guess, because that's, I mean, even look, obviously, the United States is a republic,

2:09:09.060 --> 2:09:14.900
 but we had Bush, then we had Clinton, then we had more Bush, then we had President Obama,

2:09:14.900 --> 2:09:16.900
 then we were about to have another Clinton.

2:09:16.900 --> 2:09:18.260
 That's fairly creepy.

2:09:18.260 --> 2:09:18.500
 Yeah.

2:09:19.140 --> 2:09:20.340
 Even on its own.

2:09:20.340 --> 2:09:26.580
 But now we added another, I mean, I'm sure we'll have a generation of Trumps now.

2:09:26.580 --> 2:09:27.080
 Gee.

2:09:27.080 --> 2:09:35.000
 I'm Russian, so I think we humans like kings still and queens.

2:09:36.040 --> 2:09:41.000
 There's something, we're attracted to the thing we talked about, coaches.

2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:45.560
 There's something in us that longs towards that authoritarian control.

2:09:45.560 --> 2:09:53.080
 One of the beautiful things about America, the Second Amendment, is we also like individual

2:09:53.080 --> 2:09:53.480
 freedom.

2:09:53.480 --> 2:09:59.320
 That's one of the unique aspects at the founding of this country and still, and for me, is

2:09:59.320 --> 2:10:08.040
 the beacon of hope that somehow there's the fire of freedom burns in like that Texas feel.

2:10:09.080 --> 2:10:10.440
 That gives me hope.

2:10:10.440 --> 2:10:17.960
 The FU energy that revolts against the power, which as we discussed, power corrupts and

2:10:17.960 --> 2:10:25.880
 ultimately leads to degradation of whoever's ruling the people.

2:10:25.880 --> 2:10:26.840
 It's interesting though.

2:10:26.840 --> 2:10:30.440
 It seems to me, maybe I'm just, I don't know if I'm reading this properly when I see it,

2:10:30.440 --> 2:10:37.640
 but it seems to me that, like you said, that flip the bird, I'm going to do me within reason.

2:10:37.640 --> 2:10:43.800
 As long as I'm not hurting you, is idea that very much, at least in my mind, defines the

2:10:43.800 --> 2:10:48.600
 American ideal or at least part of the consciousness of the United States is under attack to a

2:10:48.600 --> 2:10:49.240
 certain extent.

2:10:50.600 --> 2:10:58.600
 If only I can think to maybe a generation behind us, it's becoming more collectivist

2:10:59.240 --> 2:11:01.480
 for all the good and also the not good of that.

2:11:01.480 --> 2:11:08.600
 And it's not in terms of policy at this point, but just in terms of consciousness.

2:11:08.600 --> 2:11:10.920
 And I wonder if that's an internet thing.

2:11:10.920 --> 2:11:14.360
 People are more in touch with one another than they've, as far as I can tell, have ever

2:11:14.360 --> 2:11:16.520
 been, or at least more than in my lifetime.

2:11:16.520 --> 2:11:20.760
 And the rest of the world seems much closer than it did.

2:11:20.760 --> 2:11:23.480
 Living in Virginia, California seems very far away.

2:11:23.480 --> 2:11:25.080
 Being on the internet, it's just right there.

2:11:25.080 --> 2:11:25.800
 I can hear about it.

2:11:25.800 --> 2:11:26.840
 I can see it.

2:11:26.840 --> 2:11:29.080
 I can interact with people from there.

2:11:29.720 --> 2:11:37.800
 I remember being in Tennessee at one time and reading about events taking place in the

2:11:37.800 --> 2:11:38.520
 Middle East.

2:11:38.520 --> 2:11:40.520
 And that just seemed like a mile away.

2:11:40.520 --> 2:11:43.160
 It seemed like an unbelievably far distance.

2:11:43.160 --> 2:11:45.800
 And then another time when you're in DC, you just feel like, oh, you read about something

2:11:45.800 --> 2:11:46.520
 happening in Paris.

2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:51.160
 And it just feels like it's just right around the corner because DC is a seat of power where

2:11:51.160 --> 2:11:52.520
 things are just occurring all the time.

2:11:52.520 --> 2:12:01.000
 And I guess you wonder about that's where I come back to the group decisions to not

2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:03.000
 listen to this person or to cancel this.

2:12:03.800 --> 2:12:08.280
 We all, the moral majority, shall do the following as opposed to as long as you're not hurting

2:12:08.280 --> 2:12:12.760
 me and as long as you're not hurting anyone else, I have to let you do, I have to let

2:12:12.760 --> 2:12:14.040
 you be on general principle.

2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:16.040
 Even if I don't like you, I'm very free to not like you.

2:12:16.040 --> 2:12:20.760
 I'm free to speak out against you, but I'm not, it is not within my right or, and not

2:12:20.760 --> 2:12:21.080
 with it.

2:12:21.080 --> 2:12:25.640
 And it's not, I would not be right to attempt to attack you.

2:12:25.640 --> 2:12:29.560
 And that is an interesting thing though, when we see words being redefined or words being

2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:33.640
 defined, whether it's toxicity, whether it's violence, if I think that what you're saying

2:12:33.640 --> 2:12:39.320
 is your speech is by itself a violence or a precursor to violence, I'm justified in

2:12:39.320 --> 2:12:40.360
 doing all sorts of things.

2:12:41.800 --> 2:12:47.000
 And that creeps me out significantly because again, even if it ends up being pointed in

2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:49.880
 a good direction initially, it's only a matter of time.

2:12:49.880 --> 2:12:54.840
 And actually that brings me to another, yeah, I got all day.

2:12:54.840 --> 2:12:57.080
 How much are they paying you?

2:12:57.080 --> 2:13:02.920
 But we about say the Frank Herbert estate, not enough frankly, let's see.

2:13:02.920 --> 2:13:05.160
 And how many books are there in Dune?

2:13:05.160 --> 2:13:06.200
 That's a Jen question.

2:13:07.240 --> 2:13:08.680
 You're also a fan of Dune?

2:13:08.680 --> 2:13:15.240
 I read the whole series, but not a couple of the, I read all the prequels as well with

2:13:15.240 --> 2:13:16.520
 the exception of a couple.

2:13:16.520 --> 2:13:18.680
 Is there a book one for Dune?

2:13:18.680 --> 2:13:20.520
 Dune would be book one.

2:13:20.520 --> 2:13:25.320
 And even the prequels, it's still all better if you start, like I read Dune and then read

2:13:25.320 --> 2:13:27.000
 the original, what is it?

2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:27.480
 Six.

2:13:27.480 --> 2:13:29.400
 And then I went back and started to read some of the books.

2:13:29.400 --> 2:13:34.040
 Just like watching Star Wars, you want to start episode four or whatever?

2:13:34.040 --> 2:13:35.080
 Yeah, I think so.

2:13:35.800 --> 2:13:39.720
 That's the move and then stop at six, call it a day, watch The Mandalorian.

2:13:40.520 --> 2:13:42.520
 Well, I thought you're not walking back here.

2:13:42.520 --> 2:13:43.960
 No, I like The Mandalorian.

2:13:43.960 --> 2:13:44.920
 No, it's not The Mandalorian.

2:13:44.920 --> 2:13:45.800
 That is what I said.

2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:49.720
 I was told that I was heartless for not liking Baby Yoda, who I...

2:13:49.720 --> 2:13:54.120
 We don't talk about a couple of the movies, not including The Mandalorian.

2:13:54.120 --> 2:13:55.480
 The Mandalorian is fine.

2:13:55.480 --> 2:13:58.280
 It's the more recent movies that we don't like to talk about.

2:13:58.280 --> 2:13:59.880
 Oh, the...

2:13:59.880 --> 2:14:00.840
 What's his name?

2:14:00.840 --> 2:14:01.640
 The goofy guy.

2:14:02.280 --> 2:14:03.000
 Ryan.

2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:03.480
 No, no.

2:14:04.280 --> 2:14:06.120
 No, the creature, the goofy creature with the...

2:14:06.120 --> 2:14:06.680
 Jar Jar?

2:14:06.680 --> 2:14:07.560
 Yeah, Jar Jar.

2:14:07.560 --> 2:14:12.600
 Do you ever see the Jar Jar Binks is actually like the Dark Lord of the Sith theory?

2:14:12.600 --> 2:14:16.760
 That fixed the whole initial trilogy where he's goofing around and making it all the

2:14:16.760 --> 2:14:17.560
 way through battles.

2:14:17.560 --> 2:14:21.000
 And when you're like, wait a minute, he oops his way, walks over to a pool, does a triple

2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:24.600
 backflip, falls in, you're like, it's just bizarre that you...

2:14:24.600 --> 2:14:27.880
 This is the Alex Jones theory of Star Wars.

2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:29.400
 He's actually running everything.

2:14:29.400 --> 2:14:34.040
 He was the one that actually was like, hey, we should vote in Chancellor Palpatine, or

2:14:34.040 --> 2:14:37.000
 Senator Palpatine, right before they put Jar Jar in charge.

2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:38.600
 First off, what did they think was gonna happen?

2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:41.400
 And second off, I just think that'd be great.

2:14:41.400 --> 2:14:43.960
 You're like, oops, oh man, I guess he's the emperor now.

2:14:43.960 --> 2:14:44.840
 That would have been great.

2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:49.960
 But actually, to the cancel and all the other stuff, again, you'd hope that it gives pause.

2:14:49.960 --> 2:14:51.880
 And I think about this for fighting, because a lot of times...

2:14:51.880 --> 2:14:57.320
 I'll use this as an example, people fight fans in UFC, they love people that run out

2:14:57.320 --> 2:14:58.600
 and try to murder each other.

2:14:58.600 --> 2:15:01.560
 And it's entertaining, and it's super entertaining.

2:15:01.560 --> 2:15:05.160
 But Floyd Mayweather doesn't resonate with people as much.

2:15:05.160 --> 2:15:06.040
 It's like people start...

2:15:06.040 --> 2:15:07.880
 I remember the time when Floyd was not as popular.

2:15:07.880 --> 2:15:11.320
 Now people think people love Floyd because he's 50 and oh Floyd.

2:15:11.320 --> 2:15:15.480
 And oh man, and finally he had so much success that we all can't help but recognize the man's

2:15:15.480 --> 2:15:16.680
 genius and greatness.

2:15:16.680 --> 2:15:19.320
 But prior to that, oh, he's boring, he's this, he's that.

2:15:19.320 --> 2:15:23.880
 He fights with his circumspect, he's cautious, he's pressing.

2:15:23.880 --> 2:15:26.600
 He's intelligent, deeply intelligent.

2:15:26.600 --> 2:15:30.920
 And when you watch people go out and try to murder each other, you can flip a coin 100

2:15:30.920 --> 2:15:35.640
 times and you could be lucky enough to get 100 heads, but it's still a coin flip.

2:15:35.640 --> 2:15:40.120
 And I think that that's what's going on all the time is people are getting an outcome

2:15:40.120 --> 2:15:42.600
 that they want, but it wasn't a well thought out situation.

2:15:42.600 --> 2:15:46.360
 That's why you'll win by five in a row by knockout and then lose three in a row.

2:15:46.360 --> 2:15:48.040
 And then people will go, well, what happened to that guy?

2:15:48.040 --> 2:15:49.000
 He used to be so great.

2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:51.000
 And you're like, no, he's doing what he's always been doing.

2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:54.920
 It's just, it was getting great outcomes on a coin flip prior, and it's getting negative

2:15:54.920 --> 2:15:56.520
 outcomes on a coin flip now.

2:15:56.520 --> 2:16:03.320
 But I guess what I would say is it watches, it's interesting watching, I guess, societal

2:16:03.320 --> 2:16:08.120
 beliefs become such a thing that we're almost adopting on a religious level if we're not

2:16:08.120 --> 2:16:08.920
 careful.

2:16:08.920 --> 2:16:13.400
 If when I say religious level, I mean like pan life, like this is guiding all of my

2:16:13.400 --> 2:16:15.160
 choices for all the good and the bad of that.

2:16:15.160 --> 2:16:18.600
 And this is a Dune quote is, when religion and politics travel in the same cart, the

2:16:18.600 --> 2:16:21.000
 writers believe that nothing can stand in their way.

2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:24.280
 Their movements become headlong faster and faster and faster.

2:16:24.280 --> 2:16:28.200
 They put aside all thoughts of obstacles and forget that the precipice does not show itself

2:16:28.200 --> 2:16:30.360
 to the man in the blind rush until it's too late.

2:16:31.160 --> 2:16:33.480
 And I think that that's, again, the pause.

2:16:33.480 --> 2:16:36.360
 We go, oh man, thank goodness we have this guy that wants to rebuild Germany.

2:16:36.360 --> 2:16:37.720
 He'll put us back where we need to be.

2:16:38.600 --> 2:16:45.160
 And you stop questioning your own judgment, your own, you stop thinking essentially.

2:16:45.160 --> 2:16:45.320
 Right.

2:16:45.320 --> 2:16:47.000
 I'm not allowed to question this.

2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:47.880
 Of course this is correct.

2:16:47.880 --> 2:16:49.320
 Of course, of course I'm right.

2:16:49.320 --> 2:16:50.440
 I intended to do right.

2:16:50.440 --> 2:16:52.120
 So of course my actions are correct.

2:16:52.120 --> 2:16:55.960
 I mean, how many times have any of us intended to do something helpful and ended up doing

2:16:55.960 --> 2:16:56.520
 something less?

2:16:57.080 --> 2:17:01.720
 And plenty of people who intend to do harm could by accident do something decent.

2:17:01.720 --> 2:17:07.640
 And I guess it's, I'm not saying anything terribly, terribly insightful, but it's just

2:17:07.640 --> 2:17:10.600
 one of those where it's hard to say in the moment.

2:17:10.600 --> 2:17:14.680
 And that's where you hopefully caution, you would counsel some degree of caution.

2:17:14.680 --> 2:17:20.680
 And that's what worries me with people deciding that we're all so right about this or we're

2:17:20.680 --> 2:17:25.800
 all so right about that and attempting to rather than win the argument, silence the

2:17:25.800 --> 2:17:28.040
 counter argument, no matter how crazy it may seem.

2:17:28.600 --> 2:17:31.800
 Because I just think that that idea, even when it's pointed in a good direction initially,

2:17:31.800 --> 2:17:32.840
 it's only a matter of time.

2:17:34.120 --> 2:17:38.760
 You're amongst many things, a Jiu Jitsu black belt.

2:17:39.800 --> 2:17:44.920
 One of the things that people are really curious about white belts and blue belts in Jiu Jitsu,

2:17:44.920 --> 2:17:50.440
 but also people haven't tried the art is what does it take to be a Jiu Jitsu black belt?

2:17:51.080 --> 2:17:54.840
 I think that, you know, everyone's journey is a little bit different, but the one thing

2:17:54.840 --> 2:18:00.920
 that the, it was a Calvin Coolidge quote, you know, determination, persistence is the

2:18:00.920 --> 2:18:03.480
 only thing that will win in the end.

2:18:03.480 --> 2:18:05.080
 It will always win in the end.

2:18:05.080 --> 2:18:10.200
 Not brilliance, not toughness, not education, it's persistence.

2:18:10.200 --> 2:18:15.160
 And I think that having the belief that no matter what happens to me, I will proceed

2:18:15.160 --> 2:18:19.240
 forward and I will figure out how to make this happen, hell or high water, I think is

2:18:19.240 --> 2:18:23.880
 the one thing that ties together all of the people that I've ever met that made it through

2:18:23.880 --> 2:18:25.880
 whatever it was that they were going through.

2:18:25.880 --> 2:18:31.000
 Because, you know, sometimes you can get lucky and you can have an easy time or and that

2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:32.760
 luck could be you had a good situation.

2:18:32.760 --> 2:18:35.720
 It could be, I mean, like in the obvious sense of like where you're living, where you're

2:18:35.720 --> 2:18:39.640
 training, what's going on, you had a good situation, you're unbelievably athletic.

2:18:39.640 --> 2:18:43.320
 Oh, you're going to be an astronaut, you're brilliant and an Olympic athlete, you know,

2:18:43.320 --> 2:18:45.240
 like, well, that's a fantastic situation.

2:18:45.240 --> 2:18:48.120
 You know, you won the genetic lottery and I'm sure you worked hard as well, but you

2:18:48.120 --> 2:18:49.800
 also won the genetic lottery.

2:18:49.800 --> 2:18:55.080
 It's a determination is the one thing, though, because that person could have a very easy

2:18:55.080 --> 2:18:57.240
 go of it initially and then tear their knee.

2:18:57.240 --> 2:19:01.720
 And then they're no longer the superhuman physical specimen that they were.

2:19:01.720 --> 2:19:04.520
 The only thing that will keep them going is persistence.

2:19:04.520 --> 2:19:09.800
 And I think that that I would just say that persistence to say I'll just put one foot

2:19:09.800 --> 2:19:10.600
 in front of the other.

2:19:10.600 --> 2:19:15.080
 And sometimes I can see the path ahead and sometimes it's beyond my vision, but I will

2:19:15.080 --> 2:19:15.960
 not stop.

2:19:15.960 --> 2:19:18.440
 I may even slow down, but I won't stop.

2:19:18.440 --> 2:19:22.680
 And that's the only thing that I can say that I've seen tie everyone together because there's

2:19:22.680 --> 2:19:26.440
 so many ways to the top of any mountain and there's so many different personalities and

2:19:26.440 --> 2:19:28.200
 skills and backgrounds involved.

2:19:28.760 --> 2:19:31.720
 But everyone, everyone carries on.

2:19:31.720 --> 2:19:35.400
 So at the core, the foundational advice is just don't quit.

2:19:35.400 --> 2:19:36.120
 Just keep going.

2:19:36.120 --> 2:19:37.480
 That's the lesson of martial arts.

2:19:37.480 --> 2:19:42.040
 I think, you know, we think it's like how to be strong or how to be how to win.

2:19:42.040 --> 2:19:45.960
 But in reality, it's like how to persist, how to endure, because it's all of us have

2:19:45.960 --> 2:19:49.800
 been beaten so many times and gotten beaten up so many times and thought about quitting.

2:19:49.800 --> 2:19:51.000
 Have I ever thought about quitting?

2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:51.720
 Absolutely.

2:19:51.720 --> 2:19:52.600
 Have I ever quit?

2:19:52.600 --> 2:19:52.920
 Never.

2:19:52.920 --> 2:19:55.160
 I will never, ever quit ever.

2:19:55.160 --> 2:19:56.200
 I can say that you might not me out.

2:19:56.200 --> 2:19:57.880
 I won't be damned if I quit.

2:19:57.880 --> 2:19:59.080
 What's the darkest moment?

2:19:59.080 --> 2:20:00.280
 Is it injury related?

2:20:00.280 --> 2:20:07.640
 Like, is it, uh, so like, to me, like two possibilities, I've fortunately never been

2:20:07.640 --> 2:20:13.320
 seriously injured, but I think that's a dark place to be like having to be out for many

2:20:13.320 --> 2:20:22.040
 months, uh, for, um, as Jen was saying, like with a head injury, especially like the uncertainty

2:20:22.040 --> 2:20:22.840
 that's one.

2:20:22.840 --> 2:20:29.880
 And then the other side is if you have big ambitions as a competitor, realizing that

2:20:29.880 --> 2:20:36.360
 you're not as good, like those, those doubts were like, I kind of suck.

2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:39.000
 How am I supposed to be a world?

2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:40.520
 The greatest fighter of all time.

2:20:41.080 --> 2:20:47.320
 If I, if, if like several people in the gym are kicking my ass, those are the two things

2:20:47.320 --> 2:20:48.680
 that paralyze you.

2:20:48.680 --> 2:20:55.400
 I think that everyone's darkest moment is maybe different looking from the outside for

2:20:55.400 --> 2:20:55.720
 Ryan.

2:20:55.720 --> 2:20:58.360
 I wouldn't say that he's had injuries and he's had bad ones.

2:20:58.360 --> 2:21:00.120
 I wouldn't say that was his darkest moment.

2:21:00.680 --> 2:21:05.240
 I think for me, I would say some of my head injury was my darkest moment.

2:21:06.120 --> 2:21:06.600
 Absolutely.

2:21:06.600 --> 2:21:08.440
 And I've torn my ACL twice.

2:21:08.440 --> 2:21:09.800
 I've torn my shoulders four times.

2:21:09.800 --> 2:21:11.000
 I've had lots of surgeries.

2:21:11.960 --> 2:21:17.560
 For me, the orthopedic injuries were not the most difficult.

2:21:17.560 --> 2:21:21.000
 It was the brain injury for others that might be the case for them.

2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:25.720
 Maybe they've never experienced an injury and maybe for them, that's their darkest moment

2:21:25.720 --> 2:21:30.040
 from the outside, obviously Ryan can speak to this more, but for Ryan, I think it was

2:21:30.040 --> 2:21:37.080
 the inability to, to perform at certain points to the upper, the missing of opportunities

2:21:37.080 --> 2:21:41.640
 that for him, from my perspective, watching him go through and having seen various points

2:21:41.640 --> 2:21:46.680
 of his growth from, from early purple belt on, I think the hardest time for him looking

2:21:46.680 --> 2:21:53.400
 in obviously was when he would hit moments where he wasn't able to perform for various

2:21:53.400 --> 2:21:53.720
 reasons.

2:21:53.720 --> 2:21:54.600
 He couldn't get fights.

2:21:54.600 --> 2:21:57.000
 He, he was having difficulties there.

2:21:57.000 --> 2:21:59.960
 I think that that was the hardest point for him.

2:21:59.960 --> 2:22:04.120
 Did you, did you think like with the head injury that you might not, never be able to

2:22:04.120 --> 2:22:05.240
 jujitsu again?

2:22:05.240 --> 2:22:05.480
 Yeah.

2:22:05.480 --> 2:22:11.720
 I mean, I, I, mine was very, was really bad and it was just the one hit, but I had a looping

2:22:11.720 --> 2:22:13.000
 memories for seven months.

2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:16.200
 Didn't know it because when your brain's messed up, you're not even aware that you're

2:22:16.200 --> 2:22:16.600
 looping.

2:22:17.880 --> 2:22:21.640
 And so I saw two different neurologists.

2:22:21.640 --> 2:22:23.400
 I finally, like it took a very long time.

2:22:23.400 --> 2:22:27.640
 I didn't know if I was going to be able to have like linear thoughts or read a book.

2:22:27.640 --> 2:22:31.720
 I didn't know at certain points if I could listen to music again, you know, without it

2:22:31.720 --> 2:22:32.760
 making my head hurt.

2:22:33.480 --> 2:22:38.280
 And so it was almost two years before I woke up in the morning without a headache.

2:22:39.880 --> 2:22:41.960
 Just waking up before I even start my day.

2:22:41.960 --> 2:22:44.200
 And so that's even bigger than jujitsu.

2:22:44.200 --> 2:22:45.000
 That's just life.

2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:46.840
 That's just, that's just hard.

2:22:46.840 --> 2:22:50.120
 And I think that you can experience so many things.

2:22:50.120 --> 2:22:53.640
 I've had all these injuries.

2:22:53.640 --> 2:22:56.920
 We lost a baby when I was 15, 15 weeks.

2:22:56.920 --> 2:23:02.840
 And we've had all these experiences and what the hardest point for me, not saying all those

2:23:02.840 --> 2:23:05.800
 things weren't hard, but it's kind of like, well, did you go through these?

2:23:05.800 --> 2:23:09.480
 You just realize like life goes on and you have to keep working at it and you have to

2:23:09.480 --> 2:23:09.960
 keep going.

2:23:09.960 --> 2:23:16.440
 And you asked me earlier offline, did I feel depressed and not for my head injury.

2:23:16.440 --> 2:23:20.840
 I don't think that at least in the moment I had a, any recognition of that.

2:23:20.840 --> 2:23:24.040
 It's kind of like, but I think different people's personalities.

2:23:24.040 --> 2:23:27.960
 I have kind of the like buckle down and just keep going.

2:23:27.960 --> 2:23:32.760
 And sometimes it's not until lots of time later that you realize, wow, that was really

2:23:32.760 --> 2:23:37.160
 hard because you're just struggling to live and function and do the things that you need

2:23:37.160 --> 2:23:37.720
 to do along the way.

2:23:37.720 --> 2:23:42.440
 Do you mind jumping on just like this part of the conversation just for a few minutes?

2:23:42.440 --> 2:23:45.480
 Do you mind, you know, just sitting together?

2:23:45.480 --> 2:23:46.920
 Oh, not at all.

2:23:46.920 --> 2:23:53.560
 Just for a little bit, it'd be cool if we put a face to it, you know, is it okay with

2:23:53.560 --> 2:23:53.800
 you?

2:23:53.800 --> 2:23:54.680
 Yeah, it's fine with me.

2:23:54.680 --> 2:23:55.320
 It's fine with you.

2:23:56.280 --> 2:23:58.040
 By the way, what was the head injury?

2:23:58.040 --> 2:23:59.320
 If you don't mind sharing.

2:23:59.320 --> 2:24:02.280
 Someone had dropped their knee on the back of my head during training.

2:24:02.280 --> 2:24:04.200
 It was a lot bigger than me.

2:24:04.200 --> 2:24:09.480
 So one strike to the back of the head is too much for someone.

2:24:09.480 --> 2:24:11.320
 There's a reason that's outlawed in MMA, right?

2:24:11.320 --> 2:24:14.120
 Someone 50 pounds heavier than you dropped their knee on the back of your head once.

2:24:14.120 --> 2:24:16.760
 And it's the funny thing about getting hit, right?

2:24:16.760 --> 2:24:19.400
 You never can really be sure what's going to happen.

2:24:19.400 --> 2:24:22.520
 I think it's actually one of the magical parts about jiu jitsu where, like, if you choke

2:24:22.520 --> 2:24:29.080
 me, if we know what's going to occur, you hit someone, they might be completely unharmed.

2:24:29.080 --> 2:24:32.760
 You might be punching Tony Ferguson in the face and you need to hit him with a sledge

2:24:32.760 --> 2:24:34.280
 hammer to affect this man.

2:24:34.280 --> 2:24:37.960
 And then other people, they could get really badly hurt, which I guess it's back to your

2:24:37.960 --> 2:24:42.600
 point about street fighting and things like that and serious, serious potential, second,

2:24:42.600 --> 2:24:45.320
 third order consequences of any action that we take.

2:24:45.320 --> 2:24:47.560
 But yeah, that's a tricky thing about getting hit.

2:24:48.120 --> 2:24:54.440
 How does it make you feel that, like the really shitty thing about injuries to me was that

2:24:54.440 --> 2:25:00.440
 like you start thinking like, well, if I did this one little thing different, like this

2:25:00.440 --> 2:25:01.640
 wouldn't have happened today.

2:25:01.640 --> 2:25:04.520
 Like one moment changes your entire life.

2:25:05.160 --> 2:25:09.720
 Is that, do you think that way or is that totally counterproductive?

2:25:09.720 --> 2:25:14.520
 You can't help but think that way when you've had the amount of injuries I've had, because

2:25:14.520 --> 2:25:17.080
 I've had more than most people's fair share.

2:25:18.200 --> 2:25:20.760
 As my orthopedic says, you don't want to win that.

2:25:20.760 --> 2:25:23.160
 You don't want to win the contest of who's had the most.

2:25:23.160 --> 2:25:25.240
 But since you have, you're building me a pool.

2:25:25.240 --> 2:25:30.840
 Yeah, but I think you can't help but think that way sometimes, but I definitely don't

2:25:30.840 --> 2:25:34.920
 think it's, I think it can be facilitated if you don't beat yourself up too much.

2:25:34.920 --> 2:25:41.960
 Because thinking about why have I been subject to so many injuries and a lot of it comes

2:25:41.960 --> 2:25:47.320
 to just almost all of mine in particular are people a lot heavier than me.

2:25:47.320 --> 2:25:51.400
 But if I've been training martial arts 15 years, I'm obviously on the much smaller side.

2:25:51.400 --> 2:25:52.120
 I'm a woman.

2:25:52.120 --> 2:25:57.800
 I've done thousands and thousands of rounds with people 50 pounds plus heavier than me.

2:25:57.800 --> 2:26:01.640
 I've been years not training with anyone less than 50 pounds, which is 50 pounds is almost

2:26:01.640 --> 2:26:02.760
 half my body weight.

2:26:02.760 --> 2:26:08.040
 And when you also add testosterone, the natural physiological advantages of men, not just

2:26:08.040 --> 2:26:11.400
 are they heavier with more mass, they're faster, they're more explosive, they're stronger

2:26:12.120 --> 2:26:13.640
 if they're the same size.

2:26:13.640 --> 2:26:19.880
 And so I think that the willingness to be in that environment over and over and over

2:26:19.880 --> 2:26:23.640
 again creates a lot of strength, resiliency, willingness to continue.

2:26:23.640 --> 2:26:31.400
 But it also like in order to do that, you almost have to, for me, the way I was approaching

2:26:31.400 --> 2:26:37.800
 it was like pretend like I wasn't more vulnerable and just be willing to step in and step in

2:26:37.800 --> 2:26:40.760
 and step in until you make it kind of thing until you make it kind of.

2:26:40.760 --> 2:26:43.560
 Yeah, like I'll just one day I'll be strong enough.

2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:48.600
 And you avoided injury for most, for most of those rounds, I would enjoy the problem

2:26:48.600 --> 2:26:52.520
 as Ryan points out is that like you could do thousands of rounds, but if one person

2:26:52.520 --> 2:26:57.320
 that size, that strength, that hover reacts in a way that you don't expect, it doesn't

2:26:57.320 --> 2:26:59.560
 it's not like an oops, it's like always major.

2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:01.960
 Do you regret any of it?

2:27:02.520 --> 2:27:07.720
 I think that most no one I know has experienced the degree of injuries that I've experienced.

2:27:07.720 --> 2:27:13.480
 And I started just at a time when 2005 is very different than now where you have the

2:27:13.480 --> 2:27:15.800
 coaches have more control over what you're doing.

2:27:15.800 --> 2:27:19.160
 They're more aware in general about a lot of the injuries.

2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:25.560
 There's a lot more people who are hobbyists than when I started.

2:27:25.560 --> 2:27:29.640
 They were hobbyists, but it was different kind of hobbyists, you know, than now.

2:27:29.640 --> 2:27:32.680
 Now, our girls can train with other girls.

2:27:32.680 --> 2:27:36.920
 They don't have to do thousands of rounds with somebody significantly more powerful

2:27:36.920 --> 2:27:37.960
 than them.

2:27:37.960 --> 2:27:43.800
 And for the drawbacks and the benefits of that, you know, as with anything.

2:27:43.800 --> 2:27:49.960
 So I think I think that I don't think I would go back and change it.

2:27:49.960 --> 2:27:54.440
 There were times after one of my injuries where I said to Ryan, I said, I quit, I'm

2:27:54.440 --> 2:27:55.720
 done.

2:27:55.720 --> 2:27:56.760
 I'm not doing this anymore.

2:27:56.760 --> 2:28:01.960
 I probably said it more than once, but there was one time I was really serious in 2012.

2:28:01.960 --> 2:28:03.080
 I was really serious.

2:28:03.080 --> 2:28:04.120
 I tore my shoulder.

2:28:04.120 --> 2:28:08.520
 I had I was looking at missing a big competition again in the world for my second or third

2:28:08.520 --> 2:28:09.800
 year in a row after injuries.

2:28:09.800 --> 2:28:12.360
 And I said, I'd quit my job two years before.

2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:14.920
 And I'm like, I'm done.

2:28:14.920 --> 2:28:19.080
 And Ryan, before that had always been, you know, keep me focused.

2:28:19.080 --> 2:28:21.560
 And then he kind of said, OK, if you want to be done, be done.

2:28:21.560 --> 2:28:23.800
 Just just have a good time.

2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:25.000
 No, I'm really done.

2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:27.000
 I don't want to train anymore.

2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:28.040
 OK, OK.

2:28:28.040 --> 2:28:34.920
 And then, you know, I think he helped facilitate a moment for me to go visit a friend, some

2:28:34.920 --> 2:28:38.680
 friends, some girls that were doing a girls camp who are close to my size or some friends

2:28:38.680 --> 2:28:39.720
 of mine to go train.

2:28:39.720 --> 2:28:42.120
 And I was like, oh, wait, I do love this thing.

2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:46.200
 It's harder for me on a daily basis, but that doesn't mean I don't love this thing.

2:28:46.200 --> 2:28:47.720
 And it really helped change my mind.

2:28:47.720 --> 2:28:52.440
 I started to connect with other people, travel more myself because previously he had done

2:28:52.440 --> 2:28:54.760
 that, but I hadn't really done that.

2:28:54.760 --> 2:28:58.840
 I think there was a point where when I started YouTube, it was just for fun.

2:28:58.840 --> 2:29:00.440
 I just wanted to sport after college.

2:29:00.440 --> 2:29:01.560
 I played sports as a kid.

2:29:01.560 --> 2:29:03.160
 I want to just want to exercise.

2:29:03.160 --> 2:29:04.440
 I wasn't into the martial arts.

2:29:04.440 --> 2:29:07.480
 He used to give me a hard time about it because he was always very, how can you not care about

2:29:07.480 --> 2:29:08.040
 martial arts?

2:29:08.040 --> 2:29:08.840
 I don't know.

2:29:08.840 --> 2:29:09.880
 I just want to play sports.

2:29:11.080 --> 2:29:15.080
 And Ryan was really big into kind of the philosophy side of the martial arts aspect.

2:29:16.040 --> 2:29:17.000
 He used to give me a hard time.

2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:20.280
 And I think after that moment, this moment where I looked at myself and I said, do I

2:29:20.280 --> 2:29:23.320
 want to keep doing this, is when I started to appreciate jiu jitsu.

2:29:24.120 --> 2:29:28.120
 It took off some of the pressure I'd been feeling, I think, as Ryan's girlfriend.

2:29:28.120 --> 2:29:29.960
 But I had a full time job a long time.

2:29:29.960 --> 2:29:33.320
 It was never my goal to be a jiu jitsu world champion.

2:29:33.320 --> 2:29:37.480
 And I think after that moment where I was like, you know, I really do like this.

2:29:37.480 --> 2:29:38.520
 I really do want to do this.

2:29:38.520 --> 2:29:41.320
 I had this moment like any time where you're like, I'm doing this for me.

2:29:41.320 --> 2:29:42.760
 I'm not doing this for him.

2:29:42.760 --> 2:29:50.200
 And I think that that was really lucky for me because how often in our lives,

2:29:50.200 --> 2:29:54.520
 do we have a kind of a challenge where we have to stop and we have to say, is this really

2:29:54.520 --> 2:29:55.480
 what I want?

2:29:55.480 --> 2:29:57.160
 How often in a relationship do you do that?

2:29:57.160 --> 2:30:02.120
 How often in any type of lifestyle or job do you stop and do you really ask yourself,

2:30:02.120 --> 2:30:06.520
 is something really difficult happened that you look and you go, am I just doing this

2:30:06.520 --> 2:30:08.040
 because it's convenient and easy?

2:30:08.040 --> 2:30:09.800
 Or is this what I really want to do?

2:30:09.800 --> 2:30:11.480
 Yeah, I've had those moments.

2:30:11.480 --> 2:30:13.720
 Like this podcast is one of those things.

2:30:13.720 --> 2:30:20.120
 It's like you stop and think like, I actually love this.

2:30:20.120 --> 2:30:23.640
 And it's, I had that with jiu jitsu too.

2:30:23.640 --> 2:30:28.440
 I don't think I had said until like brown belt that I stop.

2:30:28.440 --> 2:30:33.400
 I mean, yeah, it's when you first face real challenges, you think like, why am I doing

2:30:33.400 --> 2:30:33.640
 this?

2:30:34.760 --> 2:30:38.520
 I think most of my progression was why not?

2:30:38.520 --> 2:30:40.600
 I think that's the right, the leap of faith.

2:30:40.600 --> 2:30:45.080
 And then at a certain point you think like, why am I doing this?

2:30:45.080 --> 2:30:50.920
 And if you can answer, honestly, that because I love it, it's kind of a liberating feeling.

2:30:50.920 --> 2:30:53.720
 It's a, yeah, it's so powerful.

2:30:53.720 --> 2:30:54.760
 It's an acceptance.

2:30:54.760 --> 2:30:56.840
 Then you feel thankful for the opportunity to be there, right?

2:30:57.480 --> 2:30:58.120
 Because you love it.

2:30:58.120 --> 2:31:00.520
 And you go, man, this is great gratitude.

2:31:00.520 --> 2:31:02.760
 Yeah, it's ultimately gratitude.

2:31:02.760 --> 2:31:03.400
 Yeah.

2:31:03.400 --> 2:31:04.440
 Let me ask you this.

2:31:04.440 --> 2:31:06.440
 So Ryan said like, what is it?

2:31:06.440 --> 2:31:07.560
 I took over your thing.

2:31:07.560 --> 2:31:10.680
 Yeah, nobody cares about Ryan.

2:31:10.680 --> 2:31:11.800
 I wouldn't do that.

2:31:11.800 --> 2:31:13.240
 I'll Photoshop him out or whatever.

2:31:13.240 --> 2:31:14.840
 However you do that, it'd be great.

2:31:14.840 --> 2:31:16.360
 Put Sean Connery's head.

2:31:16.360 --> 2:31:16.860
 Yeah.

2:31:17.560 --> 2:31:19.560
 Just like a Dune ad over there.

2:31:19.560 --> 2:31:20.040
 Exactly.

2:31:21.080 --> 2:31:23.480
 Sean Connery, I could get down on that.

2:31:23.480 --> 2:31:26.200
 Is that the sexiest man in Sean Connery?

2:31:26.200 --> 2:31:27.160
 In the Dune universe?

2:31:27.160 --> 2:31:28.040
 That's my understanding.

2:31:28.040 --> 2:31:28.760
 Okay.

2:31:28.760 --> 2:31:29.960
 I think in any universe.

2:31:30.520 --> 2:31:31.000
 Yeah.

2:31:31.000 --> 2:31:32.360
 Well, Myron Gosling, give him.

2:31:32.360 --> 2:31:34.760
 We actually named our son after Sean Connery.

2:31:34.760 --> 2:31:35.080
 Oh, yeah.

2:31:35.080 --> 2:31:35.480
 That's right.

2:31:35.480 --> 2:31:39.240
 We did.

2:31:39.240 --> 2:31:40.120
 He was in The Rock.

2:31:40.120 --> 2:31:42.760
 That was, I love all those lame.

2:31:42.760 --> 2:31:43.720
 Nicolas Cage.

2:31:43.720 --> 2:31:44.360
 Oh, yeah.

2:31:44.360 --> 2:31:46.760
 Connery is probably the greatest movie of all time.

2:31:46.760 --> 2:31:49.160
 Dude, his accent in Connery was so awesome.

2:31:49.160 --> 2:31:50.120
 I don't know where it's from.

2:31:50.120 --> 2:31:51.560
 Alabama, I guess, or something.

2:31:51.560 --> 2:31:53.320
 I love that they got like Steve Buscemi in there.

2:31:53.320 --> 2:31:54.840
 Like we need Steve Buscemi in this thing.

2:31:54.840 --> 2:31:55.480
 We got him.

2:31:55.480 --> 2:31:56.760
 Dave Chappelle.

2:31:56.760 --> 2:31:57.560
 Yeah, that's right.

2:31:57.560 --> 2:31:57.800
 Yeah.

2:31:57.800 --> 2:31:58.840
 He's a prisoner in there.

2:31:58.840 --> 2:31:59.240
 Eight ball.

2:32:00.600 --> 2:32:01.080
 Yep.

2:32:01.080 --> 2:32:02.600
 Greatest movie of all time.

2:32:02.600 --> 2:32:03.240
 Should have won an Oscar.

2:32:03.240 --> 2:32:05.400
 Dave Chappelle also in Blue Street with Martin Lawrence.

2:32:06.760 --> 2:32:08.040
 And then, what do you call it?

2:32:08.040 --> 2:32:09.000
 Robin Hood Men in Tights.

2:32:09.000 --> 2:32:11.320
 Oh, Robin Hood Men in Tights was one of my favorites as a kid.

2:32:11.320 --> 2:32:11.880
 Half baked.

2:32:11.880 --> 2:32:14.280
 But yeah, that's a good.

2:32:16.440 --> 2:32:16.840
 Wow.

2:32:16.840 --> 2:32:19.720
 We just listed off some really bad 90s movies, but.

2:32:19.720 --> 2:32:20.760
 You take that back.

2:32:20.760 --> 2:32:21.720
 For telling our age.

2:32:23.160 --> 2:32:23.800
 Speak yourself.

2:32:24.760 --> 2:32:30.440
 So what, like in your view, I don't mean to, from like a smaller person, I guess.

2:32:30.440 --> 2:32:34.600
 That's an interesting thing about Jiu Jitsu is like that small.

2:32:34.600 --> 2:32:37.800
 I don't, I hope, hopefully it's not a bad thing.

2:32:38.440 --> 2:32:38.760
 Elf.

2:32:40.120 --> 2:32:40.840
 Elves are taller.

2:32:41.640 --> 2:32:47.880
 Like with all these like bigger people, you could still enjoy the art.

2:32:47.880 --> 2:32:53.160
 Like what does it take to get a black belt to excel, to quote unquote, master the art?

2:32:54.040 --> 2:32:55.800
 Gosh, everyone has such a different path.

2:32:55.800 --> 2:32:59.000
 Ryan's promoted six, seven people.

2:32:59.000 --> 2:32:59.560
 Something like that.

2:32:59.560 --> 2:33:07.240
 And I think about half of them have had kids, have families, have other careers.

2:33:08.040 --> 2:33:10.280
 At the time, some of them competed a lot.

2:33:10.280 --> 2:33:13.240
 Some of them have never competed or rarely competed.

2:33:13.240 --> 2:33:14.680
 Some haven't competed in a long time.

2:33:15.560 --> 2:33:17.560
 Some had started different places.

2:33:17.560 --> 2:33:21.640
 Everyone's had different journeys, even in our own little group of seven.

2:33:22.520 --> 2:33:28.600
 I think only maybe only two or three were high level competitors of that group.

2:33:28.600 --> 2:33:31.880
 At the higher belts, right, like brown, black, maybe.

2:33:32.760 --> 2:33:35.640
 And so it's just different for every person.

2:33:35.640 --> 2:33:37.720
 And that's something that we try to tell our students.

2:33:37.720 --> 2:33:39.000
 We have 400 students.

2:33:39.480 --> 2:33:41.800
 And do we have this?

2:33:41.800 --> 2:33:47.720
 We don't really have anyone who's a stated other than like the coaches like Adam,

2:33:47.720 --> 2:33:51.560
 but we don't have anyone who's like a stated high level competitor as a student at the moment.

2:33:51.560 --> 2:33:53.480
 People look at our gym and go, it's lots of competitors.

2:33:53.480 --> 2:33:54.520
 It's not lots of competitors.

2:33:54.520 --> 2:33:57.160
 It's never been lots of competitors.

2:33:57.160 --> 2:33:59.240
 And we've had ones and twos here and there.

2:34:00.040 --> 2:34:03.800
 But really everybody's in it for the long term if they're in it.

2:34:03.800 --> 2:34:07.000
 Sometimes the high level competitors are the ones that are more likely to drop off

2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:10.760
 because they have a bit of success, particularly at blue or purple.

2:34:10.760 --> 2:34:13.000
 And then they realize how hard it is at brown and black.

2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:16.440
 And then they have a hard time continuing on that path.

2:34:16.440 --> 2:34:18.680
 And then they can't look at themselves as a noncompetitor.

2:34:18.680 --> 2:34:20.840
 They have a hard time continuing with Jiu Jitsu, I think.

2:34:21.320 --> 2:34:26.120
 Whereas sometimes it's the guy who comes in as a white belt and he trains twice a week,

2:34:26.120 --> 2:34:27.320
 twice a week, every week.

2:34:27.320 --> 2:34:29.800
 And the next thing you know, he's been there for two or three years.

2:34:29.800 --> 2:34:30.760
 Like, oh, he's a blue belt.

2:34:30.760 --> 2:34:31.400
 He's a purple belt.

2:34:31.400 --> 2:34:32.440
 He's a brown belt.

2:34:32.440 --> 2:34:37.960
 And he's just consistent over a long period of time and willing to take the path.

2:34:37.960 --> 2:34:40.360
 And no two people's path is exactly the same.

2:34:40.360 --> 2:34:42.360
 No two people's lives are exactly the same.

2:34:43.880 --> 2:34:50.280
 We have students who started as a white belt as a young adult with no responsibilities.

2:34:50.280 --> 2:34:51.320
 And they train all the time.

2:34:51.320 --> 2:34:53.400
 And then they have a job.

2:34:53.400 --> 2:34:54.440
 Then they graduate college.

2:34:54.440 --> 2:34:55.080
 Then they have a job.

2:34:55.080 --> 2:34:55.800
 Then they have married.

2:34:55.800 --> 2:34:56.440
 Then they have kids.

2:34:56.440 --> 2:34:59.560
 Then they have different points in their careers and at different points in your life.

2:34:59.560 --> 2:35:05.080
 Jiu Jitsu will be there for whatever way that you're willing to accept it.

2:35:05.080 --> 2:35:06.440
 It's place, I think.

2:35:06.440 --> 2:35:10.920
 Well, that's actually kind of back to the initial question we discussed about what makes

2:35:10.920 --> 2:35:16.840
 a warrior and also what makes something or someone particularly impressive in my mind

2:35:16.840 --> 2:35:19.480
 is like what they make out of what they have.

2:35:20.680 --> 2:35:22.920
 One of my favorite movies ever is Forrest Gump.

2:35:22.920 --> 2:35:27.320
 And it's obviously it's just if you can't because I've heard people go, Forrest Gump

2:35:27.320 --> 2:35:27.560
 sucks.

2:35:27.560 --> 2:35:29.000
 I'm like, I don't like you as a person.

2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:32.200
 And you have no heart at all.

2:35:32.200 --> 2:35:35.400
 But basically, it's the story of someone that tries hard.

2:35:35.400 --> 2:35:37.720
 And it's like, yeah, but it's a funny movie.

2:35:37.720 --> 2:35:43.720
 But it's like, you know, I guess you meet each person where they are, you know, and

2:35:43.720 --> 2:35:45.960
 obviously you want everyone needs to be pushed.

2:35:45.960 --> 2:35:46.920
 We all need to be pushed.

2:35:46.920 --> 2:35:50.760
 We need friends and people around us that push us to be better versions of ourselves

2:35:51.320 --> 2:35:52.040
 all the time.

2:35:52.040 --> 2:35:55.880
 And as you mentioned, the people you spend all of your time around deeply impact you.

2:35:57.000 --> 2:35:58.600
 And we have to be willing to be pushed.

2:35:58.600 --> 2:36:04.680
 It takes a leap of faith for me to trust, for me to put some of myself in my, you know,

2:36:04.680 --> 2:36:08.840
 I guess my ability, my control, my personal agency, as it were, in the hands of someone

2:36:08.840 --> 2:36:12.200
 else that I trust and that I respect.

2:36:12.200 --> 2:36:18.760
 But if I can do that, again, maybe I never become, you know, high level black belt competitor.

2:36:18.760 --> 2:36:21.160
 But, you know, I had four of the things I was doing in my life.

2:36:21.160 --> 2:36:22.040
 I also have a family.

2:36:22.040 --> 2:36:25.240
 I have this, I have that, you know, what that person was able to accomplish in the martial

2:36:25.240 --> 2:36:28.760
 arts relative to what they were able to put in this phenomenal, you know, other times

2:36:28.760 --> 2:36:32.600
 someone could be a very successful black belt and in my mind be a bum because they could

2:36:32.600 --> 2:36:33.560
 have been a lot more.

2:36:33.560 --> 2:36:35.480
 And, you know, they could have done more.

2:36:35.480 --> 2:36:37.000
 They could have focused more.

2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:40.280
 And there's no shame in deciding that you don't want to do that.

2:36:40.280 --> 2:36:45.960
 But whatever it is that you're invested in, I remember the Take It Uneasy podcast and

2:36:45.960 --> 2:36:50.200
 that I loved because, you know, I'll just chill out like resting.

2:36:50.200 --> 2:36:50.920
 It's like vacation.

2:36:50.920 --> 2:36:51.800
 Oh, who wants to go on vacation?

2:36:51.800 --> 2:36:53.160
 Yeah, I'll go on vacation for a day or two.

2:36:53.160 --> 2:36:54.440
 You want to spend three weeks on vacation?

2:36:54.440 --> 2:36:55.080
 Like, I kill myself.

2:36:55.080 --> 2:36:55.800
 Like, get me out of here.

2:36:55.800 --> 2:36:56.840
 Like, this is horrible.

2:36:56.840 --> 2:36:58.280
 This is I'm a waste of life.

2:36:58.280 --> 2:36:59.400
 I'm not doing anything useful.

2:36:59.400 --> 2:37:01.480
 You're technically on vacation right now.

2:37:01.480 --> 2:37:01.720
 Right.

2:37:01.720 --> 2:37:02.600
 Well, this is fun, though.

2:37:02.600 --> 2:37:04.120
 It's like a one day vacation.

2:37:04.120 --> 2:37:04.520
 Exactly.

2:37:04.520 --> 2:37:08.840
 But, you know, I'm sure you're thinking about jumping off of the building right now.

2:37:08.840 --> 2:37:13.000
 But if you had to talk to me for, you know, like three days, I'm sure you'd probably

2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:13.640
 shove me off the building.

2:37:13.640 --> 2:37:14.200
 I don't blame you.

2:37:14.200 --> 2:37:14.680
 I'll be dead.

2:37:14.680 --> 2:37:16.760
 Five hours in.

2:37:16.760 --> 2:37:20.840
 But, yeah, but, you know, it's like you want to be pushing towards something because otherwise

2:37:20.840 --> 2:37:22.440
 what's the purpose of being here?

2:37:22.440 --> 2:37:24.280
 You know, it's not just a college.

2:37:24.280 --> 2:37:28.760
 It's doing something useful, building, growing as a person, helping others do the same if

2:37:28.760 --> 2:37:31.160
 that's within your power at any given time.

2:37:31.160 --> 2:37:34.200
 But I think that's kind of the neat thing about martial arts is it can be many, many

2:37:34.200 --> 2:37:36.040
 different things to many different people.

2:37:36.040 --> 2:37:40.120
 You know, I finally, for instance, was able to get a college degree this year.

2:37:40.120 --> 2:37:43.240
 That which I mean, it's not a big deal for most people, but for me it was a big deal

2:37:43.240 --> 2:37:45.000
 because I was going back and finish.

2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:45.480
 Yeah.

2:37:45.480 --> 2:37:47.400
 And I never envisioned ever going back.

2:37:47.400 --> 2:37:50.440
 And that's a hard step to go back and finish.

2:37:50.440 --> 2:37:53.720
 That's always heavy on you if you don't.

2:37:53.720 --> 2:37:54.600
 It's interesting.

2:37:54.600 --> 2:37:57.880
 I was just I was more proud of that than most things I've ever done, if I'm honest.

2:37:57.880 --> 2:38:01.080
 You know, and it was neat and I really enjoyed it and it was the process of doing it.

2:38:01.080 --> 2:38:04.840
 But, you know, are my academic credentials impressive?

2:38:04.840 --> 2:38:06.200
 Like, not in the least.

2:38:06.200 --> 2:38:10.920
 But for me, it's like it was a big deal for me personally to take that step and to go

2:38:10.920 --> 2:38:11.720
 back and do that.

2:38:11.720 --> 2:38:15.880
 And I was I was proud of the the direction and because it would have been easy, like,

2:38:15.880 --> 2:38:16.520
 do I need to do it?

2:38:16.520 --> 2:38:17.800
 Like, no, I'm in our business.

2:38:17.800 --> 2:38:18.360
 I'll do OK.

2:38:18.360 --> 2:38:18.760
 I'll try.

2:38:18.760 --> 2:38:19.880
 I'll keep fighting.

2:38:19.880 --> 2:38:24.840
 But I was happy to take the time in between fights when I was when I was unbooked for

2:38:24.840 --> 2:38:28.200
 an opponent to do something productive rather than just I'll just hang out.

2:38:28.200 --> 2:38:31.240
 You know, like I can still train every single day, but I can also train and go to school.

2:38:31.240 --> 2:38:33.000
 People go to the Olympics while going to school.

2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:35.720
 I can I can do martial arts and go to school.

2:38:37.160 --> 2:38:44.680
 One thing I got to ask is, you know, a bunch of women listen to this podcast if they haven't

2:38:44.680 --> 2:38:52.280
 done Jiu Jitsu, I think it'd be kind of intimidating to step on the mat with a bunch of bros that

2:38:52.280 --> 2:38:54.600
 like enjoy somehow killing each other.

2:38:55.320 --> 2:39:00.600
 Like, how do you succeed in that environment to where you can learn this art, learn how

2:39:00.600 --> 2:39:02.120
 to beat all those people up?

2:39:03.640 --> 2:39:04.840
 Oh, gosh.

2:39:04.840 --> 2:39:05.720
 Is there any advice?

2:39:05.720 --> 2:39:11.400
 I mean, another way to ask that is like if any women listening to this are interested

2:39:11.400 --> 2:39:14.520
 in starting Jiu Jitsu, like, is there advice for that journey?

2:39:14.520 --> 2:39:17.800
 Honestly, I think it's just walking in the door and starting.

2:39:17.800 --> 2:39:21.960
 Sometimes I don't know how to respond to that because I'm not I don't view myself as typically

2:39:21.960 --> 2:39:27.080
 anxious, particularly in interactions with other people or new people.

2:39:29.080 --> 2:39:35.880
 Shy is not a word that has been used for me by if you ask my family and they joke because

2:39:35.880 --> 2:39:37.080
 our son talks a lot.

2:39:37.080 --> 2:39:40.440
 He's advanced verbally and they're always like, oh, well, let's we know where he gets

2:39:40.440 --> 2:39:42.600
 that from because he just doesn't stop talking.

2:39:42.600 --> 2:39:44.120
 He narrates everything he does.

2:39:45.320 --> 2:39:50.840
 And so they always tease because that's like I'm known for for kind of talking a lot.

2:39:52.040 --> 2:39:56.040
 But so I haven't been typically I'm not I don't consider myself a shy person.

2:39:56.040 --> 2:40:02.280
 So for me, going into a new room, a new group of people is, you know, there's always that

2:40:02.280 --> 2:40:04.760
 you don't really know who they are, how they're going to treat you.

2:40:04.760 --> 2:40:08.280
 But I typically but I don't have a lot of anxiety with that.

2:40:08.280 --> 2:40:11.160
 So I don't if that's something that's going to put something up.

2:40:11.160 --> 2:40:15.080
 I don't really know how to to address that particular feeling.

2:40:15.800 --> 2:40:21.240
 But in terms of all of the rooms I've been and I have popped into gyms before I knew

2:40:21.240 --> 2:40:26.360
 Ryan in Florida, like I traveled for my job in Germany and Florida and in California and

2:40:26.360 --> 2:40:28.760
 places where where I don't know anyone, they don't know me.

2:40:29.400 --> 2:40:36.760
 And I have never once had anyone be anything other than than kind and solicitous and helpful

2:40:36.760 --> 2:40:41.480
 and long before when I was a white belt and a blue belt and didn't know anything and

2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:42.440
 I didn't know anyone.

2:40:42.440 --> 2:40:49.160
 And I just think that it's a community of people that it's so cool that no matter where

2:40:49.160 --> 2:40:54.920
 you go in the world, I walked into a gym in Prague one time where only two people spoke

2:40:54.920 --> 2:41:01.160
 English and and it was just yes, weird, you know, it's weird that like part of a group

2:41:01.160 --> 2:41:03.480
 and they're like, Oh, let me tell you what it's like to be part of a cult, right?

2:41:03.480 --> 2:41:07.480
 Yeah, but it's like a positive cult, like it for sure.

2:41:07.480 --> 2:41:09.000
 That's what we would say as cultists.

2:41:09.720 --> 2:41:11.080
 Yeah, that's true.

2:41:12.360 --> 2:41:13.080
 That's true.

2:41:13.080 --> 2:41:15.880
 I mean, we do need to murder everybody who practice Aikido.

2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:20.360
 Yeah, that's this cult deeply believes it.

2:41:20.360 --> 2:41:24.520
 No, but there is a like if you look at different kinds of games like chess and so on, like

2:41:25.080 --> 2:41:26.360
 there's a skepticism.

2:41:27.160 --> 2:41:30.440
 I mean, there's not a brotherhood, sisterhood feeling with Jiu Jitsu.

2:41:30.440 --> 2:41:32.440
 It's like you can roll into most places.

2:41:32.440 --> 2:41:37.240
 Even like with Judo, like I can see the contrast like because I've trained in Judo places.

2:41:38.520 --> 2:41:46.040
 It it's more like tribal, like you walk in and like, who is this?

2:41:46.920 --> 2:41:49.000
 Like there's that kind of feeling with Jiu Jitsu.

2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:52.360
 There's less so there is a little bit with like the competitors.

2:41:52.360 --> 2:41:56.360
 There's always like the competitors feeling each other out usually like the blue belts.

2:41:56.360 --> 2:42:01.640
 But like outside of that, in terms of if you don't get the if you walk in with the vibes of just

2:42:02.520 --> 2:42:07.720
 loving the art and just wanting to have a good time, you're like welcome.

2:42:07.720 --> 2:42:08.760
 It's really cool.

2:42:08.760 --> 2:42:10.120
 It's really fascinating.

2:42:10.120 --> 2:42:12.040
 It's a really great thing.

2:42:12.040 --> 2:42:16.520
 I think in as a woman, I think you you think you're walking into these rooms of these,

2:42:16.520 --> 2:42:18.440
 you know, big, strong, tough guys.

2:42:18.440 --> 2:42:23.960
 And if anything, I would I would say that they're almost like much more solicitous when

2:42:23.960 --> 2:42:27.400
 a woman comes in there and not like they're just like hitting on you all the time.

2:42:27.400 --> 2:42:31.080
 You know, it's just that you walk in and everyone is like, oh, cool.

2:42:31.720 --> 2:42:33.480
 You want to do this thing that I love.

2:42:33.480 --> 2:42:36.360
 Let me make sure you have a good experience and take care of you.

2:42:36.360 --> 2:42:40.920
 And I think that's that's an experience that that I hope people have when they come into our gym.

2:42:40.920 --> 2:42:43.720
 And and I've always felt when I walked into other gyms.

2:42:43.720 --> 2:42:47.240
 And so, you know, we try our best to to make that comfortable.

2:42:47.240 --> 2:42:51.720
 And it can be a little uncomfortable because there are when you walk into a male dominated

2:42:51.720 --> 2:42:55.320
 environment, there's conversations and topics.

2:42:55.320 --> 2:42:59.240
 There's a different style of camaraderie and joking that a lot of men will do that.

2:43:00.120 --> 2:43:02.040
 Maybe some women are more uncomfortable with.

2:43:02.040 --> 2:43:07.000
 I grew up with four brothers, so I kind of maybe was a little more desensitized to that.

2:43:07.800 --> 2:43:10.360
 And I worked for the Department of Defense for a while, too.

2:43:10.360 --> 2:43:13.720
 So before I do with the government.

2:43:13.720 --> 2:43:14.200
 Yeah.

2:43:14.200 --> 2:43:15.560
 So so I did that.

2:43:15.560 --> 2:43:16.520
 I'm already skeptical.

2:43:16.520 --> 2:43:17.020
 Yeah.

2:43:18.760 --> 2:43:19.260
 I'm not.

2:43:19.260 --> 2:43:19.760
 I'm not.

2:43:19.760 --> 2:43:20.260
 I'm not.

2:43:20.260 --> 2:43:20.760
 I'm not.

2:43:20.760 --> 2:43:22.120
 Oh, you left.

2:43:22.120 --> 2:43:25.320
 I'm not going to ask you about UFOs then, because you're not going to tell me the truth.

2:43:25.320 --> 2:43:27.000
 No, they exist.

2:43:28.920 --> 2:43:29.560
 Oh, yeah.

2:43:29.560 --> 2:43:31.320
 No, you just freaked out a lot of people.

2:43:31.320 --> 2:43:34.200
 OK, but yeah.

2:43:34.200 --> 2:43:35.640
 By the way, where's where's your school?

2:43:35.640 --> 2:43:37.080
 Because people always ask like where?

2:43:38.440 --> 2:43:42.120
 Well, we're outside of Washington, D.C., in Northern Virginia, in Falls Church.

2:43:42.120 --> 2:43:45.960
 You always want to pick like, what's the best school if I travel to this place or if I want

2:43:45.960 --> 2:43:47.160
 to move to this place?

2:43:47.160 --> 2:43:49.320
 So that's well, I mean, obviously we're biased.

2:43:49.320 --> 2:43:51.800
 But yeah, we're in the Washington, D.C. area.

2:43:51.800 --> 2:43:52.300
 The best.

2:43:52.840 --> 2:43:54.360
 OK, we just took a little break.

2:43:54.360 --> 2:43:55.400
 Now we're back.

2:43:55.400 --> 2:43:59.320
 Let me ask you one thing that a bunch of people are curious about.

2:43:59.320 --> 2:44:01.400
 You're one of the innovators.

2:44:01.400 --> 2:44:06.280
 First of all, you're one of the great innovators and philosophers and thinkers in Jiu Jitsu,

2:44:06.280 --> 2:44:06.780
 right?

2:44:07.320 --> 2:44:13.240
 But you're also one of the innovators in terms of leg locks and the 50 50 position.

2:44:13.240 --> 2:44:17.720
 And just like the fact that legs have something to do in Jiu Jitsu.

2:44:17.720 --> 2:44:25.560
 The other popularizer innovator in the space is John Donoher and his whole group of guys.

2:44:25.560 --> 2:44:32.200
 Do you have thoughts about their whole system of leg locks and their ideas about Jiu Jitsu

2:44:32.200 --> 2:44:33.000
 and so on?

2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:37.720
 Sure, I guess, you know, obviously, you know, John and the students at HENZO have been able

2:44:37.720 --> 2:44:40.840
 to do fantastic things competitively in the past number of years.

2:44:40.840 --> 2:44:46.920
 And, you know, you mentioned innovators in the in that kind of, you know, section of

2:44:46.920 --> 2:44:47.720
 Jiu Jitsu.

2:44:47.720 --> 2:44:53.400
 I would be I'd love to bring up some guys like Dean Lister, of course, Masakazu Imanari.

2:44:53.400 --> 2:44:57.800
 In fact, a lot of what was going on in like nineties Japan, like combat submission wrestling,

2:44:57.800 --> 2:45:02.680
 there was some crazy gnarly stuff that it's just it's on grainy VHS tape, but like stuff

2:45:02.680 --> 2:45:05.080
 that if people were doing now, they go, oh, my God, that's brand new.

2:45:05.080 --> 2:45:10.040
 Like there's it's it's been I think these are things that have been around for a while

2:45:10.040 --> 2:45:11.080
 in various places.

2:45:11.080 --> 2:45:17.000
 I first learned the 50 50 position, just like the leg entanglement of it from Brandon Vera,

2:45:17.000 --> 2:45:20.440
 actually, at a seminar at Lord Irwin's Martial Arts thing in 2005.

2:45:20.440 --> 2:45:25.320
 He learned it from Dean Lister, who used it to submit Alexandria Kakareko, really, really

2:45:25.320 --> 2:45:30.520
 tough Nogi guy at ADCC on there in the run that Dean made to the to the gold medal in

2:45:30.520 --> 2:45:33.080
 the absolute division, which was a great performance at the time.

2:45:33.080 --> 2:45:34.280
 First American to do that.

2:45:35.320 --> 2:45:38.120
 And, you know, and I actually saw a video.

2:45:38.120 --> 2:45:40.040
 I mean, first, a boss rootin actually broke.

2:45:40.040 --> 2:45:44.920
 I think Guy Mezger's foot with a 50 50 heel hook that he actually grabbed his heel and

2:45:44.920 --> 2:45:49.320
 his and his toes went and in pancreases back when they had like the man panties in the

2:45:49.320 --> 2:45:50.760
 high, high boots on.

2:45:50.760 --> 2:45:51.000
 Yeah.

2:45:51.000 --> 2:45:52.200
 And that was gnarly.

2:45:52.200 --> 2:45:53.560
 Boss rootin is underappreciated.

2:45:53.560 --> 2:45:58.200
 It's like it's like he double grab like and oh, yeah, like, you know, his leverage is

2:45:58.200 --> 2:45:58.520
 leverage.

2:45:58.520 --> 2:46:01.560
 It's that's like a toehold that, you know, that goes the other way.

2:46:01.560 --> 2:46:03.800
 And it's like it either doesn't work or breaks in half.

2:46:03.800 --> 2:46:09.480
 And well, he's is people don't often think of boss rootin as an innovator, but he is

2:46:09.480 --> 2:46:15.560
 in a way like he, you know, talk about like Elon Musk and first principles thinking in

2:46:15.560 --> 2:46:16.360
 terms of physics.

2:46:16.920 --> 2:46:19.480
 He like just feels like he just gets the job.

2:46:19.480 --> 2:46:24.520
 He figures out like the simplest way to get the job done of breaking things and establishing

2:46:24.520 --> 2:46:25.800
 control and hurting people.

2:46:25.800 --> 2:46:27.080
 Remember that was back in the day boss.

2:46:27.080 --> 2:46:31.560
 If you listen to boss rootin do any like commentary for any of the the big MMA shows or any MMA

2:46:31.560 --> 2:46:34.520
 show way back when anytime guys were clinches like the guys roll for a knee bar.

2:46:34.520 --> 2:46:38.280
 He was saying that way back when and now people are doing it all the time with varying degrees

2:46:38.280 --> 2:46:38.840
 of success.

2:46:38.840 --> 2:46:39.800
 It's it's funny.

2:46:39.800 --> 2:46:43.080
 It's like it's also tough to be, I think, like a breakaway thinker.

2:46:43.080 --> 2:46:46.040
 I mean, you know, group think is a real thing and group inertia.

2:46:46.040 --> 2:46:52.440
 And it's it's neat to see, you know, particularly at a time when maybe that type of stuff was

2:46:52.440 --> 2:46:53.240
 less accepted.

2:46:54.520 --> 2:46:57.320
 You know, someone going, hey, I'm going to I'm going to run off in this other direction.

2:46:57.320 --> 2:47:01.240
 I think, you know, whoever, you know, the inventor of electricity in my mind is a lot

2:47:01.240 --> 2:47:05.480
 more impressive than whomever not to say that the person down the line isn't impressive

2:47:05.480 --> 2:47:07.400
 that comes up with an interesting way to use it.

2:47:07.400 --> 2:47:08.200
 Both are cool.

2:47:08.200 --> 2:47:12.280
 But when you think about just can you imagine we're sitting here like, yeah, people, I'm

2:47:12.280 --> 2:47:13.240
 going to build an airplane.

2:47:13.240 --> 2:47:14.360
 You're like, what are you talking about?

2:47:14.360 --> 2:47:14.840
 It's crazy.

2:47:14.840 --> 2:47:15.640
 People don't fly.

2:47:15.640 --> 2:47:16.680
 I'm like, no, I'm going to do it.

2:47:16.680 --> 2:47:19.640
 And of course, it's not going to be as good as the airplane down the line, the iterative

2:47:19.640 --> 2:47:21.320
 things that happen later on.

2:47:21.320 --> 2:47:26.440
 But just being able to go to dream something into existence that you haven't seen before

2:47:26.440 --> 2:47:31.000
 and then make it happen, like takes an unbelievable like strength of character, almost like a

2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:37.000
 force of will, because you have you're you're blazing a trail that hasn't been washed away

2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:37.720
 walked before.

2:47:37.720 --> 2:47:41.960
 That's the BJ Penn factor in, you know, winning the Jiu Jitsu World Championship.

2:47:41.960 --> 2:47:44.760
 First non Brazilian to do that was back in 2001.

2:47:44.760 --> 2:47:46.520
 And then Rafael Lovato later on.

2:47:46.520 --> 2:47:50.360
 It's like he's you know, both of those guys are so unbelievably impressive in my mind

2:47:50.360 --> 2:47:55.240
 for the same reason, you know, because they were out there winning at a time when that

2:47:55.240 --> 2:47:56.440
 wasn't a common thing.

2:47:56.440 --> 2:47:57.800
 Not that it's easy to win now.

2:47:57.800 --> 2:48:01.240
 It's just there's not a psychological hurdle that needs to be left.

2:48:01.240 --> 2:48:04.200
 I remember, you know, when I was early in Jiu Jitsu, like Americans weren't winning

2:48:04.200 --> 2:48:05.640
 the world championships at any belt.

2:48:05.640 --> 2:48:08.280
 I mean, BJ, we all knew BJ Penn because BJ Penn did it.

2:48:08.280 --> 2:48:10.360
 But it was really, really uncommon.

2:48:10.360 --> 2:48:12.760
 Now it happens, you know, on a semi regular basis.

2:48:12.760 --> 2:48:14.040
 Of course, the Brazilians are so strong.

2:48:14.040 --> 2:48:15.080
 Europeans are still strong.

2:48:15.640 --> 2:48:18.040
 But in Australians are coming on as well.

2:48:18.040 --> 2:48:20.680
 But it's definitely kind of an interesting thing.

2:48:20.680 --> 2:48:25.240
 So to come back to, you know, John Danaher and the Henzo team, obviously, they're doing

2:48:25.240 --> 2:48:26.120
 fantastic things.

2:48:26.120 --> 2:48:28.440
 John's had some really, really great innovation there.

2:48:28.440 --> 2:48:33.800
 And the systematization and the methodology that they're using is great.

2:48:33.800 --> 2:48:36.040
 And it's neat to see that it's getting out there.

2:48:36.040 --> 2:48:41.160
 I would just also want, I would encourage people to make sure that they're catching

2:48:41.160 --> 2:48:44.120
 up on their history because obviously, you know, John's a brilliant instructor and has

2:48:44.120 --> 2:48:48.520
 done things for the sport that are fantastic that haven't been done before.

2:48:48.520 --> 2:48:50.360
 But, you know, none of us exist in a vacuum.

2:48:50.360 --> 2:48:51.800
 And I've learned things from everywhere else.

2:48:51.800 --> 2:48:53.880
 So, you know, John would say the same, I'm sure.

2:48:53.880 --> 2:48:56.040
 And, you know, Dean Lister would say the same.

2:48:56.040 --> 2:48:59.960
 And it's just neat when you can kind of trace the history of all of this happening because

2:48:59.960 --> 2:49:03.880
 we've had, humanity's had two arms and two legs for some time, at least as long as I've

2:49:03.880 --> 2:49:04.360
 been alive.

2:49:04.360 --> 2:49:06.280
 But you mentioned, like, airplanes.

2:49:06.280 --> 2:49:09.560
 Do you think there's something totally new to be invented in Jiu Jitsu still?

2:49:09.560 --> 2:49:16.360
 Not totally new, but like the, you know, flying isn't new, but airplanes nevertheless made

2:49:16.360 --> 2:49:17.480
 that much more efficient.

2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:22.280
 Is there, like, new ideas to be discovered in Jiu Jitsu still?

2:49:22.280 --> 2:49:26.200
 I'd say, the reason I'd say yes is the same reason I would say I believe in alchemy, even

2:49:26.200 --> 2:49:27.240
 though I don't.

2:49:27.240 --> 2:49:27.800
 No, I'm serious.

2:49:28.360 --> 2:49:29.720
 I've got some backing for this.

2:49:29.720 --> 2:49:30.040
 Okay.

2:49:30.680 --> 2:49:36.040
 You know, I guess I talk about this with a buddy of mine a lot, like, and facilitative

2:49:36.040 --> 2:49:37.960
 versus not facilitative beliefs.

2:49:38.520 --> 2:49:44.040
 And if I don't believe something is possible and I do no investigation towards it, I'll

2:49:44.040 --> 2:49:45.720
 never find something even if it's there.

2:49:45.720 --> 2:49:49.000
 It's almost like it's no different than me walking up on a group of people and going

2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:50.680
 like, oh, man, look at these jerks.

2:49:50.680 --> 2:49:53.800
 This is going to suck versus me going, oh, I wonder what these guys are up to.

2:49:53.800 --> 2:49:57.400
 I'm about to have two very different conversations, even though the players in the game are no

2:49:57.400 --> 2:49:57.720
 different.

2:49:57.720 --> 2:50:02.680
 My internal constitution has changed because of how I've decided to approach the situation.

2:50:02.680 --> 2:50:06.600
 So, although I wouldn't personally want to spend all my time trying to turn lead into

2:50:06.600 --> 2:50:11.320
 gold because I don't believe that it's likely to work, only a person who's willing to spend

2:50:11.320 --> 2:50:14.200
 his or her life in that pursuit will actually get to the bottom of that.

2:50:14.200 --> 2:50:18.120
 And also, in the pursuit of that, they're likely to find other things.

2:50:18.120 --> 2:50:21.960
 So, I think a lot of times the idea is that humanity is pushed forward by, you know, again,

2:50:21.960 --> 2:50:23.400
 it's another Orson Scott Card one.

2:50:23.400 --> 2:50:25.560
 It's like, you know, human beings are in this slog.

2:50:25.560 --> 2:50:28.120
 It's paraphrasing, just in this slog over time.

2:50:28.120 --> 2:50:32.520
 And then periodically, humanity gives birth to genius, like someone that invents the wheel,

2:50:32.520 --> 2:50:36.920
 invents electricity, pushes us forward, you know, comes up with the idea of governance

2:50:36.920 --> 2:50:40.600
 that doesn't, you know, just start and end with the point of a sword, you know.

2:50:40.600 --> 2:50:43.320
 And, you know, these aren't common things.

2:50:43.320 --> 2:50:47.320
 These are unbelievable advancements that, you know, just me sitting here, I didn't come

2:50:47.320 --> 2:50:49.080
 up with them, but I just get the benefit of it.

2:50:49.080 --> 2:50:52.840
 So, I guess what I would say is a lot of times these ideas are called crazy, you know, like

2:50:52.840 --> 2:50:54.280
 as we discussed kind of offline.

2:50:54.280 --> 2:50:58.600
 It's like, you know, Einstein was brilliant in his 20s and he was brilliant before that,

2:50:58.600 --> 2:51:02.920
 I would suspect, but basically, you know, gets recognized later on in life.

2:51:02.920 --> 2:51:05.080
 And of course, we all thought those were great ideas.

2:51:05.080 --> 2:51:08.280
 The man was probably roundly mocked for giant chunks of his life.

2:51:08.280 --> 2:51:13.080
 And I guess, so it's neat to, I would say there's definitely in my mind things that

2:51:13.080 --> 2:51:17.800
 even if it's just combinations and new to me, new ways to see things, new ways to understand

2:51:17.800 --> 2:51:22.280
 different depth of understanding, possibly new things, new positions, new ideas, because

2:51:22.280 --> 2:51:27.960
 even if that's not true, the process of going through and acting as if it is and believing

2:51:27.960 --> 2:51:33.320
 like that and focusing and trying to investigate will make any of us, will push us all forward.

2:51:33.320 --> 2:51:37.640
 Whereas sitting there, you know, obsessing over the cult of our current knowledge, I

2:51:37.640 --> 2:51:42.520
 think is the biggest, the biggest danger and the biggest cause of stagnation that exists

2:51:42.520 --> 2:51:43.000
 anywhere.

2:51:44.680 --> 2:51:45.480
 Yeah.

2:51:45.480 --> 2:51:48.920
 And it starts with believing the impossible, which is kind of interesting.

2:51:48.920 --> 2:51:54.200
 One of the things that's really inspiring to me is to see people out there, which sadly

2:51:54.200 --> 2:52:00.760
 are rare, who kind of have a combination of two things.

2:52:00.760 --> 2:52:06.360
 One is they have a worldview that involves, that includes a lot of ideas that are crazy.

2:52:07.080 --> 2:52:12.280
 And the second part is they're exceptionally focused and competent in bringing that,

2:52:13.320 --> 2:52:16.040
 whatever the ideas in that worldview to reality.

2:52:16.040 --> 2:52:18.360
 So there's certainly a lot of people with crazy ideas.

2:52:18.360 --> 2:52:20.040
 You know, there's a lot of conspiracy theorists.

2:52:20.040 --> 2:52:27.240
 They have way out there beliefs about things, but they're not doing much to like make the,

2:52:27.240 --> 2:52:29.480
 like build stuff grounded.

2:52:29.480 --> 2:52:31.400
 Like they're not engineers or whatever.

2:52:31.400 --> 2:52:33.480
 They're just like espousing different crazy ideas.

2:52:33.480 --> 2:52:36.440
 But that's why you get like the Elon Musk type characters.

2:52:36.440 --> 2:52:40.280
 And the reason I bring him up a lot is because like, there's not many others to bring up.

2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:44.440
 It's like, there's not many examples of it through history.

2:52:44.440 --> 2:52:49.000
 The people, I mean, the guy's convinced that we're going to colonize Mars.

2:52:49.640 --> 2:52:55.640
 And basically everybody on earth thinks that's insane.

2:52:56.520 --> 2:52:58.280
 Everyone except the guy that's going to do it, right?

2:52:58.280 --> 2:52:59.400
 Except that's going to do it.

2:52:59.400 --> 2:53:04.520
 And like, you can imagine like a couple of hundred years from now, people will,

2:53:05.800 --> 2:53:09.560
 I mean, first of all, they won't, certainly won't remember the haters.

2:53:10.600 --> 2:53:12.040
 They won't remember all the people.

2:53:12.040 --> 2:53:16.840
 If they do remember them, they'll remember them in a sense like people were silly to

2:53:16.840 --> 2:53:20.440
 think that this isn't the obvious path forward.

2:53:20.440 --> 2:53:24.760
 Like from a perspective, that's what Elon talks about.

2:53:24.760 --> 2:53:28.040
 Like it's obvious that we're going to expand throughout the universe.

2:53:28.760 --> 2:53:29.720
 Like, so.

2:53:29.720 --> 2:53:30.440
 From his perspective.

2:53:30.440 --> 2:53:31.640
 From his perspective.

2:53:31.640 --> 2:53:39.080
 Like, but to me it is also obvious because like either we destroy ourselves or we'll

2:53:39.080 --> 2:53:40.600
 expand beyond earth.

2:53:40.600 --> 2:53:47.320
 Like, there's not many, well, maybe it's not completely obvious.

2:53:47.320 --> 2:53:49.160
 I guess I share that worldview.

2:53:49.160 --> 2:53:55.560
 There's the other possibility that we humans find a sort of an inner peace where the forces

2:53:55.560 --> 2:54:00.200
 of capitalism will calm down and we'll all just meditate and do yoga and Jiu Jitsu and

2:54:00.200 --> 2:54:03.960
 like relax with this whole tech thing where we keep building new technologies.

2:54:03.960 --> 2:54:10.120
 But it's cool to have those kinds of people that just believe the big ambitious, crazy

2:54:10.120 --> 2:54:12.280
 dreams because that's where it starts.

2:54:12.280 --> 2:54:16.760
 If you want to build something, you have to first believe that when you also have to believe

2:54:16.760 --> 2:54:20.680
 strongly enough that you're not vulnerable and I'm speculating, but it's like, I can

2:54:20.680 --> 2:54:24.840
 only imagine how many people have told Elon that what he's doing is crazy.

2:54:24.840 --> 2:54:28.760
 So not only did he dream it up, he dreamed it up, went with it and also went with it

2:54:28.760 --> 2:54:32.200
 in the face of being told that it's not going to work.

2:54:32.200 --> 2:54:35.960
 And then anytime, and then also stepped away from the bitterness because he's done a

2:54:35.960 --> 2:54:37.880
 series of really crazy, impressive things.

2:54:37.880 --> 2:54:41.320
 And that's only those little things that I'm aware of, but, and also staying away from

2:54:41.320 --> 2:54:43.880
 the bitterness of every single time you did something good.

2:54:43.880 --> 2:54:46.600
 Initially, all I do is talk down about you.

2:54:46.600 --> 2:54:50.200
 And then eventually I act as, of course, of course, I never apologize.

2:54:50.200 --> 2:54:55.080
 And yet you don't let that dampen your spirits for the next innovation, which is pretty incredible

2:54:55.080 --> 2:54:55.720
 to me to watch.

2:54:55.720 --> 2:54:57.240
 Yeah, it's kind of cool.

2:54:57.240 --> 2:55:03.080
 I mean, it's contagious to spend time with the guy because he's not, it's, Rogan has

2:55:03.080 --> 2:55:11.080
 the same look to him, which is interesting about these people is like, there's like a

2:55:11.080 --> 2:55:15.880
 hater shield that he's like, he doesn't even like sense them.

2:55:15.880 --> 2:55:22.120
 It feels like, like it doesn't, he thinks to Elon it's like, it's obvious.

2:55:22.680 --> 2:55:27.560
 I mean, he keeps calling it like first principles thinking, like physics says it's true.

2:55:27.560 --> 2:55:28.200
 Therefore it's true.

2:55:28.200 --> 2:55:33.800
 Like he's convinced himself that like his beliefs are grounded in the fundamental fabric

2:55:33.800 --> 2:55:35.560
 of the way the universe works.

2:55:35.560 --> 2:55:37.000
 Therefore the haters don't matter.

2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:37.240
 Right.

2:55:37.960 --> 2:55:39.880
 And I mean, that's kind of like a system of thought.

2:55:39.880 --> 2:55:43.160
 He developed himself through all the difficulties, through all the doubt.

2:55:43.160 --> 2:55:48.200
 He's able to take huge risks with basically putting everything he owes on the line multiple

2:55:48.200 --> 2:55:49.640
 times throughout his life.

2:55:49.640 --> 2:55:55.240
 Amidst all the drama, amidst all the doubts, amidst all like the, he's still able to make

2:55:55.240 --> 2:55:58.200
 just clear, clearheaded decisions.

2:55:58.200 --> 2:56:01.000
 It's, I don't know what to make of it, but it's inspiring as hell.

2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:02.600
 Well, it's, I think it's something that's funny.

2:56:02.600 --> 2:56:07.160
 I think like, I can only imagine, you know, history will look back on him as a brilliant

2:56:07.160 --> 2:56:11.320
 person, but that's not the only, there's, there's a lot of maybe not numeric, not statistically

2:56:11.320 --> 2:56:14.600
 speaking, but a lot numerically on a giant planet of, you know, billions of people, a

2:56:14.600 --> 2:56:15.560
 lot of brilliant people.

2:56:16.360 --> 2:56:19.160
 Well, you know, time, place, luck, fortune, all that other stuff.

2:56:19.160 --> 2:56:24.760
 But at the same time, that clearly isn't the only determining thing in making Elon Musk,

2:56:24.760 --> 2:56:25.160
 Elon Musk.

2:56:25.160 --> 2:56:29.720
 And obviously I don't know the guy from Adam and, but it's an interesting thing that it's

2:56:29.720 --> 2:56:34.200
 not just his intellect, his belief system, his structure, how he's viewing the world.

2:56:34.200 --> 2:56:37.400
 Like that's, did he, did he reason his way to that?

2:56:37.400 --> 2:56:38.040
 Did he not?

2:56:38.040 --> 2:56:39.240
 What other factors came in?

2:56:39.240 --> 2:56:44.520
 I'm really curious about that because I guess coming, it's, again, I feel really strongly

2:56:44.520 --> 2:56:50.360
 about people's belief structure and, and this, the, how they view the world being more important

2:56:50.360 --> 2:56:52.360
 than the engine behind it.

2:56:52.360 --> 2:56:54.760
 You know, it makes someone resilient or not.

2:56:54.760 --> 2:56:57.720
 It makes someone positive or not because you could have 10,000.

2:56:57.720 --> 2:57:01.160
 I think about this for competitive stuff, you could have 10,000 things going properly

2:57:01.160 --> 2:57:02.360
 and one thing going improperly.

2:57:02.360 --> 2:57:06.120
 If you focus on the improper, you'll probably fix it at a certain point, which is good,

2:57:06.120 --> 2:57:08.200
 facilitated for development in the longterm.

2:57:08.200 --> 2:57:12.520
 But if you had to go and try to perform a task in the next five minutes and you're

2:57:12.520 --> 2:57:16.600
 focusing on the negative, your confidence and your, your, your belief in the positive

2:57:16.600 --> 2:57:18.840
 outcome of the future is likely to be damaged.

2:57:18.840 --> 2:57:22.680
 Whereas you could have 25 things going wrong, but you go, man, I sure am happy to be alive.

2:57:22.680 --> 2:57:23.480
 How fortunate I am.

2:57:23.480 --> 2:57:24.040
 This is great.

2:57:24.040 --> 2:57:25.400
 I can't, this is, I have problems to solve.

2:57:25.400 --> 2:57:26.040
 This is awesome.

2:57:26.600 --> 2:57:29.560
 Versus I had to list the problems and I start bitching about them.

2:57:29.560 --> 2:57:32.760
 Both of them are technically accurate, but it's, I guess, different lenses.

2:57:32.760 --> 2:57:36.920
 And I think that's a really neat thing to see, you know, someone, you know, exemplifying

2:57:36.920 --> 2:57:37.480
 that for us.

2:57:39.480 --> 2:57:45.880
 So maybe to look at the, the fighting world, there's a million questions I can ask here.

2:57:45.880 --> 2:57:51.080
 Like one, you mentioned BJ Penn, you, uh, first of all, you're undefeated in the UFC

2:57:51.080 --> 2:57:56.840
 and one of the fights you've had is against BJ Penn, which is, uh, kind of an incredible

2:57:56.840 --> 2:57:57.320
 fight.

2:57:57.320 --> 2:57:58.840
 You, you won performance of the night.

2:57:59.720 --> 2:58:06.520
 What did it feel like to, uh, to face BJ Penn and to beat him definitively as you did?

2:58:07.080 --> 2:58:08.600
 Like, what's that whole experience like?

2:58:09.160 --> 2:58:13.560
 I'll be honest, I didn't know if I was going to ever be able to fight again after beating

2:58:13.560 --> 2:58:17.560
 Gray Maynard in 2016. Um, you know, I've had a couple of periods of those.

2:58:17.560 --> 2:58:22.760
 I was about to join the army actually in, uh, when I was 30 before the, uh, for the

2:58:22.760 --> 2:58:25.320
 UFC before Jen sent me over to ultimate fighter.

2:58:25.320 --> 2:58:27.560
 I didn't want to go cause I was like, one, they're never going to pick me.

2:58:27.560 --> 2:58:28.920
 Two, I'd be terrible for TV.

2:58:28.920 --> 2:58:29.960
 Three, I'll probably say something.

2:58:29.960 --> 2:58:32.600
 I'm going to get burned to death in the streets.

2:58:32.600 --> 2:58:34.120
 You know, I'm like, this isn't a great idea.

2:58:34.840 --> 2:58:37.880
 And then, uh, she said, we'll go out there, see what happens, do it anyway.

2:58:37.880 --> 2:58:39.640
 And you'll be, you'll regret it if you didn't.

2:58:39.640 --> 2:58:41.240
 And then I ended up doing ultimate fighter.

2:58:41.240 --> 2:58:47.560
 And then, so I fought three times on the show and then I fought, um, for the, for the finale.

2:58:47.560 --> 2:58:51.160
 So there's four times in like five or six months, which was great.

2:58:51.160 --> 2:58:53.640
 And then it took me a year to get another opponent.

2:58:53.640 --> 2:58:55.480
 Um, and that was Gray Maynard.

2:58:55.480 --> 2:58:58.920
 And then Gray was obviously very tough guy, um, managed to get a good outcome there.

2:58:58.920 --> 2:59:02.600
 Then it took two years to fight BJ Penn.

2:59:02.600 --> 2:59:06.360
 And that was, you know, obviously I'm training all the time every single day and that never

2:59:06.360 --> 2:59:09.160
 stops, but that was, I'll be honest, like pretty deeply frustrating.

2:59:09.160 --> 2:59:12.440
 Cause you know, as a, as a human being, as an athlete, you know, I think as an athlete,

2:59:12.440 --> 2:59:13.160
 you die twice.

2:59:13.160 --> 2:59:17.160
 Like you have an athletic peak or area and then, then you go on with the rest of your

2:59:17.160 --> 2:59:19.560
 life, but it is a microcosm for the rest of your life.

2:59:19.560 --> 2:59:22.760
 It's like, you're, you're seeing this, the sand tick away in the hourglass would drop

2:59:22.760 --> 2:59:27.800
 away and you're going, man, this is, these are the years between 31, 32, 33.

2:59:27.800 --> 2:59:29.320
 Like I'll be at my best at this time.

2:59:29.320 --> 2:59:33.320
 My absolute best physically now, not technically I'm a lot better now than I was before.

2:59:33.320 --> 2:59:37.320
 And I plan, but at a certain point you will, unless you're Bernard Hopkins, you will reach

2:59:37.320 --> 2:59:42.520
 diminishing returns and I guess the long, the long way you can feel the clock ticking

2:59:42.520 --> 2:59:44.040
 is frustrating.

2:59:44.040 --> 2:59:46.760
 Why, why did it take two years for BJ?

2:59:46.760 --> 2:59:49.800
 I, I, I, that's the question people ask a lot.

2:59:49.800 --> 2:59:52.280
 It's like, why does nobody want to fight Ryan?

2:59:52.280 --> 2:59:52.680
 I don't know.

2:59:52.680 --> 2:59:56.360
 I probably, they probably think they'll get infected by whatever this is, but I don't,

2:59:56.360 --> 2:59:57.160
 I don't blame them.

2:59:57.160 --> 3:00:00.760
 But I would mean you're a really tough opponent as bought as the bottom line.

3:00:00.760 --> 3:00:01.960
 I'll say that I'm different.

3:00:01.960 --> 3:00:06.200
 Maybe they perceive that the, the, the, the threat is greater than the reward.

3:00:06.200 --> 3:00:11.080
 I'm hoping that now that we're ranked number 12, you know, in the UFC rankings that, that,

3:00:11.080 --> 3:00:11.720
 that will change.

3:00:11.720 --> 3:00:16.360
 And I know that if we're one more win and then we're in the top 10 that, you know, now,

3:00:16.360 --> 3:00:17.720
 now we're, you're there.

3:00:17.720 --> 3:00:21.960
 But what I've consistently found is that like randoms want to fight and I'm like, go away.

3:00:21.960 --> 3:00:23.160
 I didn't come here for you.

3:00:23.160 --> 3:00:26.120
 You know, cause if I wanted to just fight anybody, I could go down to a waffle house

3:00:26.120 --> 3:00:28.680
 and yell until like DMX shows up and we can, we can fight.

3:00:28.680 --> 3:00:29.720
 Cause he'll be at the waffle house too.

3:00:29.720 --> 3:00:30.120
 Who am I kidding?

3:00:30.120 --> 3:00:31.640
 I really want to hang out with the MX.

3:00:31.640 --> 3:00:36.360
 But you know, it's like, you want to, when I had the opportunity, oh my God, that was

3:00:36.360 --> 3:00:37.080
 so cool.

3:00:37.080 --> 3:00:39.720
 I was, I would never, I would never fight DMX.

3:00:39.720 --> 3:00:40.520
 We'd be on the same team.

3:00:41.240 --> 3:00:48.600
 But anyway it's, I guess I accepted fights against, I asked, they got asked about Lamas.

3:00:48.600 --> 3:00:49.240
 I said, yes.

3:00:49.240 --> 3:00:50.760
 I got asked about Dennis Bermudez.

3:00:50.760 --> 3:00:51.320
 I said, yes.

3:00:51.960 --> 3:00:53.240
 You know, like long periods of time.

3:00:53.240 --> 3:00:59.800
 And they, at that time, well, you know, in between 2016 and 2018 I was struggling to

3:00:59.800 --> 3:01:01.880
 have, have opponents who would sign up.

3:01:01.880 --> 3:01:04.360
 And so I haven't turned down fights.

3:01:04.360 --> 3:01:07.960
 I've just said, Hey, you know, keep the, I don't care about fighting the randoms.

3:01:07.960 --> 3:01:10.200
 And it's, you have a successful school.

3:01:10.200 --> 3:01:15.480
 You're like, you're running your martial artists broadly speaking.

3:01:15.480 --> 3:01:21.880
 So it doesn't make sense to take fights that aren't like that fit a certain kind of trajectory

3:01:21.880 --> 3:01:22.520
 for your career.

3:01:22.520 --> 3:01:25.480
 And that's when, when BJ Penn, they said, well, BJ is looking for an opponent.

3:01:25.480 --> 3:01:27.000
 I was like, I'm, I'm your guy.

3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:31.320
 And, and I think that, you know, BJ accepted that fight because I'm another jujitsu guy.

3:01:31.320 --> 3:01:34.680
 I don't think he, he, he perceived that I was much of a threat on the feet.

3:01:35.720 --> 3:01:42.200
 And, you know, I was able to, it was neat to get it to compete against someone, you

3:01:42.200 --> 3:01:45.720
 know, who's one of my heroes, one of the people I looked up to in MMA for the longest time.

3:01:45.720 --> 3:01:47.160
 Were you intimidated by that?

3:01:47.160 --> 3:01:48.920
 No, no, I love competing.

3:01:48.920 --> 3:01:51.720
 I don't really get nervous or scared before fights.

3:01:51.720 --> 3:01:52.680
 I'm not afraid to get hurt.

3:01:52.680 --> 3:01:53.640
 I'm not afraid to win.

3:01:53.640 --> 3:01:54.920
 I'm not afraid to lose.

3:01:54.920 --> 3:01:59.000
 It's, I, I'm just excited for the, I feel thankful for the opportunity to compete and

3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:01.480
 the opportunity to, to play when it matters.

3:02:01.480 --> 3:02:05.720
 You know, I, I just, that's the only time I'm interested in playing anymore is when

3:02:05.720 --> 3:02:09.400
 it, when it matters, when the opposition is, I know that, you know, it's funny because

3:02:09.400 --> 3:02:14.040
 people pick on, on a lot of some opponents, particularly after, after the fact, like if

3:02:14.040 --> 3:02:17.000
 you, if you get a good outcome, well then, oh, of course, let's beat that guy.

3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:17.800
 That guy wasn't that good.

3:02:17.800 --> 3:02:19.800
 I'm like, well, I wasn't, that's after the fact.

3:02:19.800 --> 3:02:20.840
 I get to say that.

3:02:20.840 --> 3:02:25.720
 And also as the person in the ring, you know, BJ Penn has heard a lot of people in mixed

3:02:25.720 --> 3:02:29.480
 martial arts cage and I could actually absolutely have been on that list.

3:02:30.440 --> 3:02:34.360
 So it was neat to get to compete against someone that I really respect, someone that I looked

3:02:34.360 --> 3:02:37.560
 up to for a long time, someone who has a great skillset.

3:02:37.560 --> 3:02:39.960
 And also I went up in weight to fight him at his weight class.

3:02:39.960 --> 3:02:42.360
 He didn't have to come down to mine, which is where he'd take it.

3:02:42.360 --> 3:02:43.000
 It was lightweight.

3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:43.640
 Yeah.

3:02:43.640 --> 3:02:44.760
 I'm generally a featherweight.

3:02:44.760 --> 3:02:46.840
 I walk around at like 158 pounds.

3:02:46.840 --> 3:02:49.640
 So what's the lightweight and featherweight?

3:02:49.640 --> 3:02:53.880
 Lightweight is 155 with the day before Wayne and featherweight is 145 with the day before

3:02:53.880 --> 3:02:54.200
 Wayne.

3:02:54.200 --> 3:02:56.840
 So I'm a little bit more properly sized for featherweight.

3:02:57.400 --> 3:03:02.760
 But anyway, you know, I, so I didn't feel like obviously he was giving up a couple

3:03:02.760 --> 3:03:06.360
 years of age, but I was giving up size and all this other stuff.

3:03:06.360 --> 3:03:09.960
 And it was, you know, I was just excited to have the opportunity to step in against someone

3:03:09.960 --> 3:03:14.840
 like BJ and you know, we managed to get out of there with a, with a good outcome without

3:03:14.840 --> 3:03:16.440
 getting too banged up.

3:03:16.440 --> 3:03:21.160
 But just, it was cool cause we tied up on the fence and just even the second, you know,

3:03:21.160 --> 3:03:24.120
 is when you're rolling with somebody and you touch and you can feel what they're doing

3:03:24.120 --> 3:03:25.240
 and you go, man, this guy's really good.

3:03:25.960 --> 3:03:29.320
 You can feel the calm, you can feel the small minor adjustments that they're making, the

3:03:29.320 --> 3:03:30.840
 subtle things that they're doing.

3:03:30.840 --> 3:03:34.760
 And that was one of those things that was really neat and gratifying because you know,

3:03:34.760 --> 3:03:35.320
 you never know.

3:03:35.320 --> 3:03:38.600
 Sometimes people that you've heard of are a little bit less technically proficient than

3:03:38.600 --> 3:03:39.000
 you thought.

3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:41.560
 And other times you'll meet some guy that you're training like, who the hell is this

3:03:41.560 --> 3:03:41.720
 guy?

3:03:41.720 --> 3:03:43.480
 How have I not heard of this person?

3:03:43.480 --> 3:03:47.640
 And BJ was exactly, as a jiu jitsu guy, what I would have thought.

3:03:47.640 --> 3:03:51.400
 And another thing, that's another thing that bugged me about how people reacted after the

3:03:51.400 --> 3:03:55.480
 fight is, you know, basically going, oh, BJ screwed up this, screwed up that.

3:03:55.480 --> 3:03:57.240
 And I'm like, all right, yeah.

3:03:57.240 --> 3:03:58.120
 That's so interesting.

3:03:58.760 --> 3:03:59.560
 That's sad.

3:04:00.360 --> 3:04:05.640
 That was, you know, one of the, and to me, I mean, as a fan of both, that was a beautiful

3:04:05.640 --> 3:04:13.080
 moment as a, as a kind of passing of a torch in a sense of exceptional performance.

3:04:13.080 --> 3:04:20.280
 Like another one that stands out to me, maybe you can comment, is I don't understand, well,

3:04:20.280 --> 3:04:23.240
 maybe I do, why Conor McGregor gets as much hate as he does.

3:04:24.520 --> 3:04:26.440
 He probably revels in it.

3:04:26.440 --> 3:04:37.560
 But I think he doesn't get enough credit for Jose Aldo for the, for like, for basically,

3:04:37.560 --> 3:04:44.280
 you know, knocking him out in the first few seconds of a fight.

3:04:44.840 --> 3:04:47.960
 I mean, Jose is like one of the greatest fighters ever.

3:04:47.960 --> 3:04:48.460
 That's true.

3:04:49.160 --> 3:04:51.720
 Maybe some people can even put him in the top 10.

3:04:51.720 --> 3:04:52.600
 No question.

3:04:52.600 --> 3:05:01.080
 And the, like, I don't understand why it's, doesn't get as much, like Conor McGregor

3:05:01.080 --> 3:05:07.080
 doesn't get as much credit as I think he deserves for that and for Eddie Alvarez and all the

3:05:07.080 --> 3:05:15.480
 fights, for some reason, whenever Conor McGregor beats somebody, well, they were not that good

3:05:15.480 --> 3:05:15.960
 then.

3:05:15.960 --> 3:05:19.080
 Like, it means like they were, they were, something was off.

3:05:19.080 --> 3:05:19.560
 Right.

3:05:19.560 --> 3:05:20.760
 That's convenient, isn't it?

3:05:20.760 --> 3:05:21.080
 Yeah.

3:05:21.080 --> 3:05:23.320
 It's quite strange to me.

3:05:23.320 --> 3:05:29.160
 But I mean, what are your thoughts on the, on Conor McGregor?

3:05:29.160 --> 3:05:33.720
 Maybe one way to ask that, I'm Russian, so I'm obviously also a Khabib fan, but I'm also

3:05:33.720 --> 3:05:37.000
 a Conor fan, it seems like there's not many of us who are, like, fans of both.

3:05:37.000 --> 3:05:37.240
 Right.

3:05:38.200 --> 3:05:39.000
 What are your thoughts?

3:05:39.000 --> 3:05:39.800
 You and Artem Lobov.

3:05:41.560 --> 3:05:43.240
 The two of us, which also is a good fight.

3:05:45.240 --> 3:05:45.960
 Tough dude.

3:05:45.960 --> 3:05:47.800
 Yeah, really, really tough dude.

3:05:47.800 --> 3:05:49.640
 He's like five languages, really interesting kid.

3:05:49.640 --> 3:05:52.040
 Oh, so, oh wow, I didn't know that side of it.

3:05:52.040 --> 3:05:52.840
 There's a brain there.

3:05:54.040 --> 3:05:57.320
 Well, on the Khabib versus Conor, what do you make of their first fight?

3:05:57.880 --> 3:06:00.840
 What do you, do you agree with me that they should fight again?

3:06:00.840 --> 3:06:04.840
 Because I think it would be awesome if they fought again in Moscow.

3:06:04.840 --> 3:06:09.720
 And do you agree with me, I'm just going to put, say things that piss people off,

3:06:09.720 --> 3:06:13.160
 but I believe is that Conor actually has a chance to beat Khabib.

3:06:13.880 --> 3:06:16.120
 One, that Conor absolutely has a chance to beat Khabib.

3:06:16.120 --> 3:06:19.000
 Conor has a chance to beat anyone that he steps into that ring with, and not just like

3:06:19.000 --> 3:06:19.960
 a mathematical chance.

3:06:19.960 --> 3:06:24.120
 You're like, oh, one of the billion, but like, you know, like he absolutely, it's funny

3:06:24.120 --> 3:06:27.800
 because I won't pretend to know Conor really well, but I first met Conor in 2010 when I

3:06:27.800 --> 3:06:31.080
 was teaching a seminar in, at Strait Blast Gym Ireland in Dublin.

3:06:31.960 --> 3:06:36.040
 And that's actually where I first met all of the coaches that ended up being on Conor's

3:06:36.040 --> 3:06:36.540
 team.

3:06:37.320 --> 3:06:42.600
 You know, John Kavanaugh, Owen Roddy, Gunnar Nelson, you know, so for, I actually, I enjoyed

3:06:42.600 --> 3:06:46.440
 being on Ultimate Fighter and being on Uriah Faber's team and getting to train with all

3:06:46.440 --> 3:06:46.920
 the guys there.

3:06:46.920 --> 3:06:50.120
 But at the same time, the people that I was actually, I knew better were actually the

3:06:50.120 --> 3:06:52.040
 European side, all of Conor's coaches.

3:06:52.040 --> 3:06:57.800
 And that was a neat thing because I got to, I met Conor, I didn't know who Conor, like

3:06:57.800 --> 3:06:58.840
 Conor wasn't Conor at that point.

3:06:58.840 --> 3:07:00.680
 Yeah, that was before his UFC debut.

3:07:00.680 --> 3:07:01.880
 Oh yeah, well, well before, yeah.

3:07:01.880 --> 3:07:04.680
 I think, I think he got in like 2014, maybe something like that.

3:07:04.680 --> 3:07:05.180
 Yeah.

3:07:05.180 --> 3:07:08.760
 And anyway, but he was doing well in Cage Warriors, winning the titles there.

3:07:08.760 --> 3:07:13.640
 I think prior to that, you know, I remember going, seeing him on the show and also then

3:07:13.640 --> 3:07:19.000
 getting to see him train because I competed, I was initially slated to fight David Tamer

3:07:19.000 --> 3:07:22.840
 for the Ultimate Fighter finale before getting put in to fight Artem for the title for the

3:07:22.840 --> 3:07:23.340
 show.

3:07:23.340 --> 3:07:27.640
 So I went over to Ireland to train for a couple of days and basically it was neat to watch

3:07:27.640 --> 3:07:28.600
 him, watch him work.

3:07:28.600 --> 3:07:33.640
 I mean, man is focused and trains a lot and very, very smart and very, very hardworking.

3:07:33.640 --> 3:07:40.520
 And I think a lot of times people get stuck in the, in this, you know, and they almost

3:07:40.520 --> 3:07:44.920
 want to believe that this was lucky or this, this person, you know, like they're not working

3:07:44.920 --> 3:07:45.240
 that hard.

3:07:45.240 --> 3:07:45.960
 They're just out there.

3:07:45.960 --> 3:07:49.560
 They got there with their mouth and that's, that's just not the case.

3:07:49.560 --> 3:07:52.840
 And you know, I don't know what it's like, you know, obviously Connors very well off

3:07:52.840 --> 3:07:55.480
 right now and I don't know how hard, how seriously he's training, what he's doing.

3:07:55.480 --> 3:07:59.960
 I can't speak to any of that, but there's no question that he has skills to be dangerous.

3:07:59.960 --> 3:08:03.480
 And one of the funny things, obviously the Khabib fight when Khabib was a great fighter

3:08:03.480 --> 3:08:07.400
 and also has the chance to beat anyone in that ring at any given time.

3:08:07.400 --> 3:08:14.760
 But there's, there was a Conner, you know, it's a one that he can, he can put anybody

3:08:14.760 --> 3:08:16.040
 away.

3:08:16.040 --> 3:08:19.400
 And as you mentioned, I think that he doesn't get the credit for the Eddie Alvarez fight.

3:08:19.400 --> 3:08:20.760
 He doesn't get the credit for the Jose Aldo fight.

3:08:20.760 --> 3:08:22.120
 Cause it was almost so much of a letdown.

3:08:22.120 --> 3:08:24.760
 I remember that happened the same weekend that I did the ultimate fighter finale.

3:08:25.400 --> 3:08:26.840
 And you're like, all right, wait, what?

3:08:28.760 --> 3:08:29.240
 Yeah.

3:08:29.240 --> 3:08:32.280
 It almost doesn't feel like a fight happening, but we mentioned Miyamoto Musashi.

3:08:32.280 --> 3:08:36.120
 I mean, Musashi was famous for the way he poked and prodded that people with what he

3:08:36.120 --> 3:08:39.320
 was doing, whether overtly or not, it's like, Oh, we're supposed to fight to the death.

3:08:39.320 --> 3:08:41.480
 And, uh, you know, at 3 PM tomorrow, great.

3:08:41.480 --> 3:08:43.560
 4 PM rolls around, I'm just not there.

3:08:43.560 --> 3:08:44.040
 Five.

3:08:44.040 --> 3:08:47.000
 I mean, you remember all the, all the antics and nonsense that Conner was pulling prior

3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:50.360
 to that, like speaking personally, that's not, it's not something I would feel comfortable

3:08:50.360 --> 3:08:52.120
 doing, but it's like, everyone's different.

3:08:52.120 --> 3:08:55.240
 And the effect that it had on, on Jose was, I mean, beyond evident.

3:08:55.240 --> 3:08:59.320
 When was the last time Jose started the, started the fight with leaping left hand,

3:08:59.320 --> 3:09:01.240
 leaping right hand, you're like, wait, what?

3:09:01.240 --> 3:09:06.680
 And then he was obviously, you know, living rent free and in Jose's head at that point.

3:09:06.680 --> 3:09:11.640
 And that was a combination of psychological, you know, ability and, and, and wherewithal

3:09:11.640 --> 3:09:12.680
 and then physical.

3:09:12.680 --> 3:09:15.960
 And it reminded me of the way Muhammad Ali would, would bother people and whatnot.

3:09:15.960 --> 3:09:21.640
 And, uh, the fact that he's a polarizing figure, um, I think makes some people not give him

3:09:21.640 --> 3:09:22.120
 his due.

3:09:22.120 --> 3:09:27.080
 And then at the same time, sometimes certain fans may be go overboard, but, uh, they remember

3:09:27.080 --> 3:09:30.600
 the knee that Ben Askren got knocked out with by Masoudal.

3:09:30.600 --> 3:09:34.440
 I mean, that was an amazing, unbelievable thing, but three inches to the right, three

3:09:34.440 --> 3:09:38.360
 inches to the left, I guess, whichever side his head wasn't, could have been squarer.

3:09:38.360 --> 3:09:43.160
 But, uh, and that fight starts with Ben Askren on top of you in the first five seconds.

3:09:43.960 --> 3:09:48.840
 Well, Connor ran and threw a knee just like that at Khabib and Khabib got right around

3:09:48.840 --> 3:09:48.840
 it.

3:09:48.840 --> 3:09:50.120
 That could have easily gone the other way.

3:09:50.120 --> 3:09:53.480
 Can you imagine what would have happened if after the, after coming back from boxing,

3:09:53.480 --> 3:09:58.840
 um, after coming back from, from the Mayweather fight, Connor, in the first 10 seconds, it's

3:09:58.840 --> 3:10:04.600
 Khabib in the first 10 seconds, it's over and you're like, he would, it would have been

3:10:04.600 --> 3:10:08.680
 intolerable, but basically, like, you know, but see, here's the thing.

3:10:08.680 --> 3:10:10.360
 Let me actually push back slightly.

3:10:10.360 --> 3:10:18.600
 Uh, I mean, to the fans, correct me if I'm wrong, but Connor seems to cause I've competed

3:10:18.600 --> 3:10:20.440
 a lot and like there's a tension.

3:10:20.440 --> 3:10:26.040
 There's a negativity sometimes depending on the opponent and there's a respect afterwards

3:10:26.040 --> 3:10:30.600
 that happens, like when you understand that there's a deep like respect and almost like

3:10:30.600 --> 3:10:31.560
 love for each other.

3:10:32.440 --> 3:10:37.160
 Like, I always seen that in Connor, like all the trash talk afterwards.

3:10:37.160 --> 3:10:37.560
 Yes.

3:10:37.560 --> 3:10:39.560
 There's a, it's, it's a subtle thing.

3:10:39.560 --> 3:10:42.040
 You can't always see it, but there's a respect like.

3:10:42.040 --> 3:10:42.920
 I agree.

3:10:42.920 --> 3:10:51.400
 And like that, I almost on the Khabib side, I almost feel like Khabib really took it personally.

3:10:51.400 --> 3:10:54.200
 He did, he didn't, he lost the respect for Connor.

3:10:54.200 --> 3:10:56.440
 I thought, I thought the whole time Connor had the respect.

3:10:56.440 --> 3:11:01.160
 So I, I, what I wanted to say is like, if Connor won that fight, like rock Khabib, I

3:11:01.160 --> 3:11:04.520
 could see like, I wouldn't see trash talking.

3:11:04.520 --> 3:11:07.000
 I could see like trash talking stop right there.

3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:10.760
 I think so too, but at the same time, I'm sure you recall like Connor, Connor crossing

3:11:10.760 --> 3:11:14.680
 some pretty personal territory, you know, both religiously and, and also familiarly

3:11:14.680 --> 3:11:15.640
 with, uh, with Khabib.

3:11:15.640 --> 3:11:19.880
 And it's, you know, I mean, I think it's the sort of thing that, I don't know, it's, it's

3:11:19.880 --> 3:11:21.720
 an interesting, that's one of the reasons.

3:11:21.720 --> 3:11:28.040
 Like you have to know the diff so obviously I know the, the, the Khabib, uh, the Dagestani

3:11:28.040 --> 3:11:29.960
 people, they don't play around like that.

3:11:29.960 --> 3:11:31.960
 They don't play around like that.

3:11:31.960 --> 3:11:36.040
 You know, I mean, they take offense to basically, I mean, you, you don't do that.

3:11:36.040 --> 3:11:42.680
 So, uh, so like Connor didn't, maybe he did it on purpose or maybe he wasn't even just

3:11:42.680 --> 3:11:47.640
 aware of, of, uh, it was cultural differences of the box he opened.

3:11:47.640 --> 3:11:52.440
 Like you, you can talk to Floyd Mayweather, you can, you can go anywhere with him.

3:11:52.440 --> 3:11:58.840
 You can, you can say the most offensive things, but with, uh, with Khabib, it's, it's, yeah,

3:11:58.840 --> 3:12:03.400
 hard lines, but you, uh, I mean, a lot of people ask, I know you're a featherweight,

3:12:03.400 --> 3:12:11.400
 but if you were to, uh, face, it feels like Khabib was one of the hardest puzzles to solve

3:12:11.400 --> 3:12:13.960
 in, in all of mixed martial arts.

3:12:13.960 --> 3:12:19.800
 If you were to face Khabib, do you think, how would you go about solving that puzzle?

3:12:19.800 --> 3:12:23.800
 Like almost the question is almost from a Jiu Jitsu perspective too.

3:12:23.800 --> 3:12:28.840
 What do you do with a guy that's exceptionally good at controlling position, especially on

3:12:28.840 --> 3:12:32.840
 top, very good at wrestling and taking down and controlling position.

3:12:32.840 --> 3:12:38.280
 Like let's say, so forget maybe striking on the ground.

3:12:38.280 --> 3:12:40.360
 How do you solve that guy?

3:12:40.360 --> 3:12:44.680
 Like what do you do with your guard if you get taken down or do you create an entire

3:12:44.680 --> 3:12:49.080
 system of not getting taken down or escaping is like, what, what ideas do you have for

3:12:49.080 --> 3:12:50.080
 that?

3:12:50.080 --> 3:12:53.080
 Well, I guess I would say in my mind, fighting is a game of trading energy.

3:12:53.080 --> 3:12:58.240
 Um, kind of, uh, you know, there's two, there's two things, there's damage and there's energy.

3:12:58.240 --> 3:13:02.360
 So like when I say energy and being like, uh, tired, not tired, how much, how much gas

3:13:02.360 --> 3:13:03.360
 you've got.

3:13:03.360 --> 3:13:05.880
 Um, and then damage counts obviously as well.

3:13:05.880 --> 3:13:09.000
 Um, you could be feeling, I could be feeling great and then you get to kick me in the head

3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:10.560
 hard, really hard three times.

3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:12.080
 It doesn't matter that I could get up and run a mile.

3:13:12.080 --> 3:13:13.240
 I can't get up.

3:13:13.240 --> 3:13:18.960
 So anyway, um, you know, I, I think what Khabib does is so well is he makes the fight look

3:13:18.960 --> 3:13:20.560
 like it could be an amalgamated fight.

3:13:20.560 --> 3:13:25.960
 Um, he does a great job of avoiding damage on the feet for the most part and really sucking

3:13:25.960 --> 3:13:30.280
 the life out of people with how suffocating and oppressive is his control is.

3:13:30.280 --> 3:13:33.820
 Um, his chain wrestling is as good as anyone we've ever seen in the UFC.

3:13:33.820 --> 3:13:34.820
 It's fantastic.

3:13:34.820 --> 3:13:40.220
 Um, but, uh, that poses a really serious threat for people that need to maintain a certain

3:13:40.220 --> 3:13:44.320
 amount of space and try to hurt them on the feed because unless they're able to inflict

3:13:44.320 --> 3:13:48.400
 an adequate amount of damage, they're going to each time, let's say for instance, let's

3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:51.320
 say him taking them down as a foregone conclusion at some point.

3:13:51.320 --> 3:13:55.000
 Um, if every single time Khabib takes you down, you get right back up.

3:13:55.000 --> 3:13:58.680
 It's not that big a deal, um, because it's actually more, we've all experienced this.

3:13:58.680 --> 3:14:01.480
 Let's say you and I are rolling, you tap me 15 times in one round.

3:14:01.480 --> 3:14:02.480
 Who's more tired?

3:14:02.480 --> 3:14:03.480
 Probably you are.

3:14:03.480 --> 3:14:04.480
 Yeah.

3:14:04.480 --> 3:14:05.480
 Yeah.

3:14:05.480 --> 3:14:08.240
 My ass so badly that, that it's like, you're the only one working, but, um,

3:14:08.240 --> 3:14:13.560
 So if you're comfortable with the up and down of it, like being taken down.

3:14:13.560 --> 3:14:18.840
 If you're, if you don't, if you don't get hurt badly or tired on the bottom, you have

3:14:18.840 --> 3:14:23.520
 a chance, but that doesn't involve just cracking him on the feet before he gets ahold of you.

3:14:23.520 --> 3:14:24.520
 Um,

3:14:24.520 --> 3:14:25.520
 That's a lot.

3:14:25.520 --> 3:14:26.520
 That's a lot to ask.

3:14:26.520 --> 3:14:27.520
 That's a lot to ask.

3:14:27.520 --> 3:14:28.520
 That's difficult to do.

3:14:28.520 --> 3:14:32.540
 It seemed actually like Connor, it seemed like it when he was being kind of taken down

3:14:32.540 --> 3:14:37.680
 or the, the take down attempts against Khabib, he seemed to be somewhat relaxed the whole

3:14:37.680 --> 3:14:38.680
 thing.

3:14:38.680 --> 3:14:39.680
 I thought he was doing well, actually.

3:14:39.680 --> 3:14:42.320
 I think that particularly for the first round, I thought he did a very good job.

3:14:42.320 --> 3:14:47.260
 It's just one of those things that I think like, uh, Khabib being the fights taking place

3:14:47.260 --> 3:14:49.560
 in Khabib's world in large part.

3:14:49.560 --> 3:14:53.760
 And I mean, set aside that one giant, uh, was it right hand that, that Khabib hit Connor

3:14:53.760 --> 3:14:56.040
 with it, by the way, Connor reacted like an absolute champion.

3:14:56.040 --> 3:15:01.400
 He got crushed by that overhand and then drop and his eyes went right back on Khabib.

3:15:01.400 --> 3:15:03.560
 It was immediate positive, great response.

3:15:03.560 --> 3:15:06.960
 So even though that was, I think that was a bit of a surprising thing, Connor reacted

3:15:06.960 --> 3:15:07.960
 really, really well.

3:15:07.960 --> 3:15:11.880
 But if you're going to be on bottom with Khabib for four rounds, that's going to be tough.

3:15:11.880 --> 3:15:15.840
 And also Connor's a way better grappler than people like to give him credit for, but he's

3:15:15.840 --> 3:15:20.520
 not the type of grappler that can do that can, that can, that's too tall of an order,

3:15:20.520 --> 3:15:23.560
 but there are grapplers that could do that or at least would have a much, much better

3:15:23.560 --> 3:15:26.560
 shot at, uh, being able to weather that type of a storm.

3:15:26.560 --> 3:15:30.440
 Do you see yourself being able to be relaxed through that kind of storm?

3:15:30.440 --> 3:15:39.160
 Well, I guess I can remember being, being, being, being savagely beaten is very relaxing.

3:15:39.160 --> 3:15:45.280
 The time that the timing of that answer was like, okay, that's a dumb question.

3:15:45.280 --> 3:15:51.840
 No, that's ultimately the goal of Jiu Jitsu is to, um, be relaxed to the fire.

3:15:51.840 --> 3:15:52.840
 For sure.

3:15:52.840 --> 3:15:55.960
 And remember like every UFC fighter, I win all hypothetical matchups.

3:15:55.960 --> 3:15:59.440
 Yeah, that's true.

3:15:59.440 --> 3:16:06.160
 Uh, since, uh, I'm one to ask ridiculous questions and we've been talking about sci fi and all

3:16:06.160 --> 3:16:07.160
 that kind of stuff.

3:16:07.160 --> 3:16:12.320
 Let me ask the kind of big question that everybody disagrees about, certainly with me is, uh,

3:16:12.320 --> 3:16:18.920
 who are the top five greatest MMA fighters of all time and, um, um, why is Fedor number

3:16:18.920 --> 3:16:19.920
 one?

3:16:19.920 --> 3:16:20.920
 Okay.

3:16:20.920 --> 3:16:21.920
 Well, first off, Fedor is number one.

3:16:21.920 --> 3:16:22.920
 Oh really?

3:16:22.920 --> 3:16:23.920
 Oh yeah.

3:16:23.920 --> 3:16:24.920
 Right there with you.

3:16:24.920 --> 3:16:25.920
 Really?

3:16:25.920 --> 3:16:26.920
 Oh yeah.

3:16:26.920 --> 3:16:27.920
 Talk about people that just get completely underappreciated.

3:16:27.920 --> 3:16:30.440
 He's never been in the, uh, like he's never succeeded in the UFC.

3:16:30.440 --> 3:16:31.680
 It's not his fault.

3:16:31.680 --> 3:16:35.480
 It came along after him at the time that, at the time that Fedor was at his height,

3:16:35.480 --> 3:16:38.440
 the UFC was not where it was at for heavyweight fighting.

3:16:38.440 --> 3:16:42.800
 I mean, not that there weren't good heavyweights there, but Fedor, Fedor was unbelievable.

3:16:42.800 --> 3:16:43.800
 You know what I mean?

3:16:43.800 --> 3:16:47.320
 You remember, I mean, Minotaur Noguera, I was a massive fan of him.

3:16:47.320 --> 3:16:52.060
 I still remember watching, uh, what is it pride 2004 when, when Noguera fought Cro Cop

3:16:52.060 --> 3:16:56.680
 and got blasted with that left kick and dropped with like seconds left in the first round.

3:16:56.680 --> 3:16:59.600
 Pride was great cause he had a 10 minute first round and that five minute second, which again

3:16:59.600 --> 3:17:02.360
 materially alters, alters the fight big time.

3:17:02.360 --> 3:17:05.200
 And you know, just the texture of the fight is just totally, it's borderline a different

3:17:05.200 --> 3:17:09.000
 sport, you know, then, then getting a five, a pause and a five.

3:17:09.000 --> 3:17:12.160
 But anyway, uh, similar sports, like one of those swimming things where they have nine

3:17:12.160 --> 3:17:14.240
 gold medals for different types of swimming, right?

3:17:14.240 --> 3:17:15.240
 But still swimming.

3:17:15.240 --> 3:17:16.240
 But anyway, um,

3:17:16.240 --> 3:17:17.240
 Oh yeah.

3:17:17.240 --> 3:17:18.240
 They would disagree.

3:17:18.240 --> 3:17:19.240
 Yeah.

3:17:19.240 --> 3:17:20.240
 I don't mean, I'm not trying to.

3:17:20.240 --> 3:17:21.240
 They specialize in that.

3:17:21.240 --> 3:17:22.240
 Of course.

3:17:22.240 --> 3:17:23.240
 It's so, it's totally true.

3:17:23.240 --> 3:17:24.240
 10, 10 minutes is different than five minutes.

3:17:24.240 --> 3:17:25.240
 Sorry.

3:17:25.240 --> 3:17:27.160
 Don't take, don't, don't, don't drown me swimmers.

3:17:27.160 --> 3:17:28.160
 I don't swim very well.

3:17:28.160 --> 3:17:32.520
 It's easy for me to, easy for me to downplay it, but anyway, um, uh, yeah.

3:17:32.520 --> 3:17:33.520
 And then no,

3:17:33.520 --> 3:17:36.080
 Better than, uh, John Jones, like the modern era.

3:17:36.080 --> 3:17:40.160
 Well, I mean, I guess it's, it's tough to compete, to compare across eras.

3:17:40.160 --> 3:17:44.480
 It would be like going and saying like, Oh man, how, how would such and such great grappler

3:17:44.480 --> 3:17:47.520
 from today fare against someone from 1995?

3:17:47.520 --> 3:17:52.960
 I'm like, well, probably pretty well for them, depending upon who they are, what's going

3:17:52.960 --> 3:17:53.960
 on.

3:17:53.960 --> 3:17:57.080
 There's some people that would, their skill sets might transition across eras, but a lot

3:17:57.080 --> 3:17:59.000
 of times not, but that's not fair.

3:17:59.000 --> 3:18:04.120
 We get the, they'll be like comparing Spartans to modern day, you know, like army guys.

3:18:04.120 --> 3:18:05.120
 You're like, well, who's going to win?

3:18:05.120 --> 3:18:07.640
 I'm like, well, did modern day army guys get modern day weapons?

3:18:07.640 --> 3:18:11.880
 Well, yeah, but who's the toughest ruggedest group of people at the very least?

3:18:11.880 --> 3:18:14.840
 So I guess it's, it's tough to say, but at least in my mind, the people that I think

3:18:14.840 --> 3:18:20.120
 about for great fighters, their, their, their quality of opposition, um, their level of

3:18:20.120 --> 3:18:23.520
 like lasting and like success, their level of lasting innovation.

3:18:23.520 --> 3:18:26.920
 Like the courage that they have to demonstrate, because again, it's like being a big fish

3:18:26.920 --> 3:18:28.680
 in a small pond takes no courage.

3:18:28.680 --> 3:18:32.520
 Doesn't mean that there's nothing there, but it just requires something a little bit different.

3:18:32.520 --> 3:18:34.840
 So Kazushi Sakuraba is one of my guys too.

3:18:34.840 --> 3:18:39.160
 Um, BJ Penn also, I mean, BJ Penn fought Lyoto Machida.

3:18:39.160 --> 3:18:40.400
 That's insane.

3:18:40.400 --> 3:18:42.800
 You know, it's, that was a time, it was a different sport.

3:18:42.800 --> 3:18:45.600
 It was a different time in the sport where, you know, they were, some guys were, were

3:18:45.600 --> 3:18:50.040
 bouncing around doing different things, but let's, so I guess the Gracie family, it's,

3:18:50.040 --> 3:18:54.880
 I mean, they never had an in like, obviously Hoist was there, um, but they never, and that

3:18:54.880 --> 3:18:56.320
 was a definitely a different sport.

3:18:56.320 --> 3:18:57.800
 Weight classes being open, things like that.

3:18:57.800 --> 3:18:59.760
 Yeah, but you have to say that Hoist is up there.

3:18:59.760 --> 3:19:00.760
 Oh, no question.

3:19:00.760 --> 3:19:01.760
 One of the greatest ever.

3:19:01.760 --> 3:19:02.760
 I think so too.

3:19:02.760 --> 3:19:06.600
 And again, I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you, um, if it weren't for him.

3:19:06.600 --> 3:19:11.880
 So the Gracie family as a whole, but I mean, who's the better, I mean, I think Hoist would

3:19:11.880 --> 3:19:15.440
 tell you himself probably that, that Hickson would have handled business back then, but

3:19:15.440 --> 3:19:16.440
 they didn't put him in.

3:19:16.440 --> 3:19:19.060
 So again, he's the greatest fighter, the greatest fighter, the greatest fighter that we saw

3:19:19.060 --> 3:19:20.060
 do his business.

3:19:20.060 --> 3:19:21.480
 So Hoist up there for sure.

3:19:21.480 --> 3:19:26.080
 What about, so this is like, nobody seems to agree with me on this, but like this connects

3:19:26.080 --> 3:19:28.200
 to soccer again and Messi.

3:19:28.200 --> 3:19:36.040
 It seems that people value like how long you've been a champion, how many like defenses of

3:19:36.040 --> 3:19:39.340
 the championship that you've had successfully.

3:19:39.340 --> 3:19:43.760
 To me, I highly value singular moments of genius.

3:19:43.760 --> 3:19:49.640
 So like, like, I, I don't, like, if you look at Conor McGregor, he hasn't, I guess, held,

3:19:49.640 --> 3:19:51.640
 I've been a champion very long, very much.

3:19:51.640 --> 3:19:53.120
 Well, he didn't defend either title, right?

3:19:53.120 --> 3:19:58.280
 He didn't defend any other, uh, either of the titles, but like, if you talk, and same

3:19:58.280 --> 3:20:04.260
 with Messi, if you look at, uh, Lionel Messi, there's just moments of brilliance unlike

3:20:04.260 --> 3:20:07.640
 any other in history for both Conor and Messi.

3:20:07.640 --> 3:20:11.040
 And people don't seem to give credits like, well, how many world cups have you won?

3:20:11.040 --> 3:20:15.720
 But to me, like, why is it about this arbitrary world cup thing or championship thing?

3:20:15.720 --> 3:20:17.440
 I think it's easier for people to wrap their head around, right?

3:20:17.440 --> 3:20:18.440
 It's like the NFL combine.

3:20:18.440 --> 3:20:20.960
 When was, I mean, yeah, numbers.

3:20:20.960 --> 3:20:24.760
 It's something that, well, again, if I go and if I pick Tom Brady in the first round,

3:20:24.760 --> 3:20:27.560
 you know, and it works out, they call me a genius.

3:20:27.560 --> 3:20:31.600
 If I had to pick Tom Brady in the first round after his combine and it doesn't work out,

3:20:31.600 --> 3:20:34.760
 I get fired and I'm never hired again, I have to work, work somewhere else.

3:20:34.760 --> 3:20:37.520
 But it's like, I'm insulating myself from criticism.

3:20:37.520 --> 3:20:40.680
 I think almost if I go by the numbers, well, he had more bench presses.

3:20:40.680 --> 3:20:45.640
 It's like, how, how many times have the guys that are like the super studs in the, uh,

3:20:45.640 --> 3:20:49.960
 in the NFL combine ever been on the greatest players in the NFL history, in NFL history,

3:20:49.960 --> 3:20:52.160
 like zero or close to zero.

3:20:52.160 --> 3:20:56.020
 And even if, even if there's some, it's certainly not a one to one correlation.

3:20:56.020 --> 3:20:57.020
 So it's so funny though.

3:20:57.020 --> 3:20:59.920
 I think it's just like, how many, how long, how many days did he hold the title?

3:20:59.920 --> 3:21:02.640
 Oh, your title reign was X times longer.

3:21:02.640 --> 3:21:03.640
 That means nothing.

3:21:03.640 --> 3:21:06.620
 So if we wanted to find greatest fighter ever, like you said, I think individual moments

3:21:06.620 --> 3:21:09.300
 of like, like that was transcended, that was different.

3:21:09.300 --> 3:21:12.880
 That was something else because people can win or lose for any number of different reasons.

3:21:12.880 --> 3:21:14.720
 And that it's an interesting thing.

3:21:14.720 --> 3:21:19.640
 Again, I don't blame Argentina, not winning the world cup on messy, you know, that's not

3:21:19.640 --> 3:21:20.640
 fair.

3:21:20.640 --> 3:21:24.720
 You know, how many times has, you know, I mean, I use the, I remember when a Trent

3:21:24.720 --> 3:21:28.960
 Ilfer was the quarterback for the, uh, the Baltimore Ravens and they had such a strong

3:21:28.960 --> 3:21:29.960
 defense.

3:21:29.960 --> 3:21:32.520
 I'm not trying to pick on Trent Ilfer, but it's like they, they had such a strong defense

3:21:32.520 --> 3:21:33.720
 that they were to make it.

3:21:33.720 --> 3:21:38.960
 That was the Ray Lewis, you know, Chris McAllister era, you know, and they, they won, they won

3:21:38.960 --> 3:21:39.960
 the super bowl.

3:21:39.960 --> 3:21:44.680
 I don't think anyone is going to say that, you know, Trent Dilfer is a better quarterback

3:21:44.680 --> 3:21:51.000
 than, you know, or put him in the same category as Dan Marino, but he got the W he's got the,

3:21:51.000 --> 3:21:52.000
 he's got the super ring.

3:21:52.000 --> 3:21:54.320
 How many times, let's use March Madness or super, I love it.

3:21:54.320 --> 3:21:57.320
 Like that, that guy always makes the finals, but he just never gets it done.

3:21:57.320 --> 3:22:00.920
 So let me get this straight, getting to the finals nine times doesn't count because you

3:22:00.920 --> 3:22:02.400
 didn't win the end game.

3:22:02.400 --> 3:22:05.560
 I'm not saying it wouldn't be better, but that guy won the game once he got over the

3:22:05.560 --> 3:22:06.560
 hump.

3:22:06.560 --> 3:22:07.560
 Well, how many other times was he in the finals?

3:22:07.560 --> 3:22:08.560
 Zero.

3:22:08.560 --> 3:22:09.560
 All right.

3:22:09.560 --> 3:22:10.560
 Yeah.

3:22:10.560 --> 3:22:11.560
 It's interesting what we, yeah.

3:22:11.560 --> 3:22:16.240
 We were obsessed with these numbers, like, um, well, cause we can't assess their method,

3:22:16.240 --> 3:22:17.240
 right?

3:22:17.240 --> 3:22:19.680
 Well, I think most of the time, most of us can't assess the method of anything.

3:22:19.680 --> 3:22:21.800
 I'm it's like, Oh, look at that guy do X Y swimming.

3:22:21.800 --> 3:22:23.680
 I'm like, how do I know Michael Phelps is great.

3:22:23.680 --> 3:22:24.680
 I don't know.

3:22:24.680 --> 3:22:25.680
 It was faster.

3:22:25.680 --> 3:22:28.880
 I can't look at his technique and say anything other than, well, that's way better than anything

3:22:28.880 --> 3:22:32.860
 I know how to do, but I can't say the difference between him and the next guy.

3:22:32.860 --> 3:22:36.600
 So I guess that's, I wonder if it's like, I need a concrete identifier and a lot of

3:22:36.600 --> 3:22:38.360
 times people don't like saying, I don't know.

3:22:38.360 --> 3:22:43.640
 And most people won't put like a Ronda Rousey in the top, even 20 or 50 of, but like she

3:22:43.640 --> 3:22:47.760
 changed more than, more than almost anybody else.

3:22:47.760 --> 3:22:52.080
 She changed the martial arts history.

3:22:52.080 --> 3:22:59.760
 I don't know if that even, I don't think I'm exaggerating that she, she made it okay for

3:22:59.760 --> 3:23:06.640
 women to be fighters and that, and that changed the way we see like, she's one of the great

3:23:06.640 --> 3:23:13.880
 feminists of our time in a weird kind of way that like, I don't know.

3:23:13.880 --> 3:23:18.920
 Maybe I'm just a Ronda Rousey fan, but the, yeah, the, but she's not in the conversation

3:23:18.920 --> 3:23:20.640
 because then you start converting into numbers.

3:23:20.640 --> 3:23:22.120
 Well, how many did she win?

3:23:22.120 --> 3:23:25.160
 Is she among the greatest fighters or did she do the greatest things?

3:23:25.160 --> 3:23:26.160
 You know what I mean?

3:23:26.160 --> 3:23:30.160
 I don't, I think it's something, I mean, obviously Ronda is a great Sudoku who was competing

3:23:30.160 --> 3:23:34.160
 in MMA at a time when a lot of the girls like, where did you get your skills in the Olympics

3:23:34.160 --> 3:23:35.160
 or where'd you get yours?

3:23:35.160 --> 3:23:36.160
 High school.

3:23:36.160 --> 3:23:38.320
 I mean, they're going to, the Olympic girls going to beat you up.

3:23:38.320 --> 3:23:43.000
 But I guess that, that doesn't diminish her, just that accomplishment is what it is.

3:23:43.000 --> 3:23:48.360
 I don't have to, I don't, Fedor is not diminished by the fact that he would like, if he were

3:23:48.360 --> 3:23:52.600
 to fight Stephen Mayochis right now, it probably wouldn't go great or that John Jones exists.

3:23:52.600 --> 3:23:57.120
 I don't now have to like knock Fedor's accomplishments down or say, oh, because BJ Penn or so and

3:23:57.120 --> 3:24:01.480
 so let's say has a mixed record at this point that somehow invalidates the things that they've

3:24:01.480 --> 3:24:02.480
 done before.

3:24:02.480 --> 3:24:05.680
 I guess it kind of brings us back to a lot of the other people we've talked about, the

3:24:05.680 --> 3:24:09.040
 fact that the brilliant people throughout history that we love or some of the monsters

3:24:09.040 --> 3:24:13.560
 throughout history that we rightly revile in a lot of cases were complicated people

3:24:13.560 --> 3:24:15.540
 and their legacy is more than just one thing.

3:24:15.540 --> 3:24:18.920
 And someone doing something amazing doesn't invalid, doesn't mean they didn't do anything

3:24:18.920 --> 3:24:19.920
 bad.

3:24:19.920 --> 3:24:23.360
 And someone doing terrible things doesn't, doesn't mean that, doesn't invalidate the,

3:24:23.360 --> 3:24:24.600
 the positives that they did.

3:24:24.600 --> 3:24:29.440
 But I guess we fighting the urge to put people in one category and same with ourselves.

3:24:29.440 --> 3:24:30.840
 I think that's why people get depressed.

3:24:30.840 --> 3:24:32.440
 Oh, I'm good right now.

3:24:32.440 --> 3:24:33.960
 Oh, I'm bad right now.

3:24:33.960 --> 3:24:37.200
 Versus hey, we're all at work in progress and we're trying to do X number of things

3:24:37.200 --> 3:24:39.680
 and legacy is a tough thing to figure out anyway.

3:24:39.680 --> 3:24:42.320
 And it's all speculative.

3:24:42.320 --> 3:24:49.520
 Last time or no on Reddit, you said that last time too, that you don't experience much fear

3:24:49.520 --> 3:24:50.520
 before fights.

3:24:50.520 --> 3:24:53.480
 I'd like to ask you a couple of Mike Tyson things, if it's okay.

3:24:53.480 --> 3:24:54.480
 It's just interesting to me.

3:24:54.480 --> 3:24:55.480
 Maybe I'm just weird.

3:24:55.480 --> 3:25:01.540
 So there's a, I don't know if you've seen this clip of Tyson talking about how he feels

3:25:01.540 --> 3:25:08.600
 leading up to a fight that he's kind of overtaken with fear, but as he gets closer and closer

3:25:08.600 --> 3:25:12.280
 and closer to the ring, his confidence grows.

3:25:12.280 --> 3:25:14.840
 Have you seen the clip?

3:25:14.840 --> 3:25:15.840
 I'm aware of it.

3:25:15.840 --> 3:25:16.840
 Okay.

3:25:16.840 --> 3:25:17.840
 I haven't seen it in a while.

3:25:17.840 --> 3:25:18.840
 Here, let me play it for you.

3:25:18.840 --> 3:25:21.840
 I think George St. Pierre said something similar to me one time.

3:25:21.840 --> 3:25:27.920
 While I'm in the dressing room, five minutes before I come out, my gloves are laced up.

3:25:27.920 --> 3:25:28.920
 I'm breaking my gloves down.

3:25:28.920 --> 3:25:33.080
 I'm pushing the lever on the back of my leg, breaking the middle of the glove so my knuckle

3:25:33.080 --> 3:25:34.080
 pierced through the lever.

3:25:34.080 --> 3:25:38.360
 I feel my knuckle piercing against the tight leather gloves on the Everlast box.

3:25:38.360 --> 3:25:42.280
 When I come out, I have supreme confidence, but I'm scared to death.

3:25:42.280 --> 3:25:43.280
 I'm totally afraid.

3:25:43.280 --> 3:25:44.280
 I'm afraid of everything.

3:25:44.280 --> 3:25:45.280
 I'm afraid of losing.

3:25:45.280 --> 3:25:48.560
 I'm afraid of being humiliated, but I'm just totally confident.

3:25:48.560 --> 3:25:50.840
 The closer I get to the ring, the more confidence I get.

3:25:50.840 --> 3:25:52.760
 The closer, the more confidence I get.

3:25:52.760 --> 3:25:54.960
 The closer, the more confidence I get.

3:25:54.960 --> 3:25:57.080
 All during my training, I've been afraid of this man.

3:25:57.080 --> 3:25:59.360
 I thought this man might be capable of beating me.

3:25:59.360 --> 3:26:03.720
 I've dreamed of him beating me, but I always stayed afraid of him.

3:26:03.720 --> 3:26:06.360
 But the closer I get to the ring, I'm more confident.

3:26:06.360 --> 3:26:08.280
 Once I'm in the ring, I'm a god.

3:26:08.280 --> 3:26:09.280
 No one can beat me.

3:26:09.280 --> 3:26:10.280
 I'm a god.

3:26:10.280 --> 3:26:16.640
 I mean, first of all, he's cognizant of both his demons and whatever the hell ideas he

3:26:16.640 --> 3:26:17.640
 has about violence.

3:26:17.640 --> 3:26:18.640
 It's so interesting.

3:26:18.640 --> 3:26:25.080
 Is there something about the tension that he's describing about being confident and

3:26:25.080 --> 3:26:27.040
 scared that resonates with you?

3:26:27.040 --> 3:26:32.120
 Or do you hold to this idea that you've kind of spoken about before that you're really

3:26:32.120 --> 3:26:33.120
 not afraid?

3:26:33.120 --> 3:26:36.440
 No, I can appreciate what he's saying.

3:26:36.440 --> 3:26:42.240
 I think that I can speak to feeling concerned about, let's say, for instance, if you feel

3:26:42.240 --> 3:26:48.480
 a certain way, I think people are a lot more like computers than we like to admit.

3:26:48.480 --> 3:26:52.720
 And just because a lot of times I can't parse what's going on and why doesn't mean that

3:26:52.720 --> 3:26:55.720
 it doesn't make sense.

3:26:55.720 --> 3:26:59.960
 And I think that, at least in the times, if I'm concerned about a situation or about a

3:26:59.960 --> 3:27:05.200
 person or about something happening prior to the fight, I'm like, there's a reason.

3:27:05.200 --> 3:27:06.200
 There was a reason.

3:27:06.200 --> 3:27:07.760
 I don't have to push that down and bury it.

3:27:07.760 --> 3:27:08.760
 There's a reason.

3:27:08.760 --> 3:27:09.760
 Why?

3:27:09.760 --> 3:27:10.760
 What have I not thought about?

3:27:10.760 --> 3:27:11.760
 What have I not done?

3:27:11.760 --> 3:27:12.760
 What am I missing?

3:27:12.760 --> 3:27:13.760
 Why am I feeling this way?

3:27:13.760 --> 3:27:17.240
 As you mentioned, for yourself prior, you'd be like, why am I feeling like this?

3:27:17.240 --> 3:27:20.680
 I don't do this very well in certain aspects of my life now that I mention it or now that

3:27:20.680 --> 3:27:21.680
 I think about it.

3:27:21.680 --> 3:27:24.920
 But when it comes to competing, I think I do an all right job and I'm trying to learn

3:27:24.920 --> 3:27:25.920
 to be better.

3:27:25.920 --> 3:27:29.920
 And it's going like, well, why do I, if I feel this way, there's a reason.

3:27:29.920 --> 3:27:30.920
 Okay.

3:27:30.920 --> 3:27:31.920
 Am I thinking about this the wrong way?

3:27:31.920 --> 3:27:33.640
 Have I not adequately prepared for something?

3:27:33.640 --> 3:27:38.680
 I have to address it and then maybe I'll be up for four hours that night, like extra hours

3:27:38.680 --> 3:27:42.640
 thinking what have I not addressed, watching sparring, watching this, watching that.

3:27:42.640 --> 3:27:49.520
 And then when I am thinking about things more accurately or when I've addressed what that

3:27:49.520 --> 3:27:53.960
 concern was, I feel any of that concern kind of dissipate.

3:27:53.960 --> 3:27:59.240
 And I guess if I honestly thought that, I guess when it comes to, I know I'm going to

3:27:59.240 --> 3:28:03.660
 die at a certain point, obviously, I'm going to get hurt, pain happens.

3:28:03.660 --> 3:28:08.160
 But the pain of loss would be nothing compared to the, or the pain of injury would be nothing

3:28:08.160 --> 3:28:12.440
 compared to the pain of running away.

3:28:12.440 --> 3:28:18.320
 And so I guess if I think about where's my value, it's like I feel like I'm a winner

3:28:18.320 --> 3:28:21.960
 and every single time I step into that ring and fight with everything that I have, I can't

3:28:21.960 --> 3:28:23.680
 promise that I'll win my next fight.

3:28:23.680 --> 3:28:28.160
 I know that I have the skills and the tools to beat anyone in grappling or in mixed martial

3:28:28.160 --> 3:28:29.160
 arts at this point.

3:28:29.160 --> 3:28:33.920
 It's just, I know that for certain, I've trained with enough people, I've competed with enough

3:28:33.920 --> 3:28:36.040
 people, I know where I stand.

3:28:36.040 --> 3:28:39.840
 But I also know that I'm not perfect and also the better fighter, even if I perceived that

3:28:39.840 --> 3:28:43.720
 I was that thing, doesn't win on the night.

3:28:43.720 --> 3:28:47.000
 The man who fights better wins on the night.

3:28:47.000 --> 3:28:53.360
 And if I give credence in my mind to only the person that's won has value versus going,

3:28:53.360 --> 3:28:54.440
 what's your process?

3:28:54.440 --> 3:28:56.080
 What's your path through this?

3:28:56.080 --> 3:28:57.080
 How are you going about this?

3:28:57.080 --> 3:28:58.120
 How are you thinking about this?

3:28:58.120 --> 3:28:59.960
 How are you behaving?

3:28:59.960 --> 3:29:05.480
 Then if I can focus on the process, then I will respect my opponent and I will respect

3:29:05.480 --> 3:29:12.520
 myself and I'll respect anyone that behaves with a certain level of consistency to that.

3:29:12.520 --> 3:29:16.540
 And they could win, there's plenty of winners in history that are shitbags and there's plenty

3:29:16.540 --> 3:29:18.440
 of losers that are not.

3:29:18.440 --> 3:29:22.240
 But winning doesn't make you a bad or good person and losing doesn't make you good by

3:29:22.240 --> 3:29:25.000
 default either or bad by default.

3:29:25.000 --> 3:29:30.040
 And I think that that can be the truth socially, that can be the truth athletically and academically.

3:29:30.040 --> 3:29:31.040
 So I guess...

3:29:31.040 --> 3:29:37.840
 Is there a primal fear though, like a primal fear of getting hurt?

3:29:37.840 --> 3:29:47.080
 The running away and not facing the threat long term is the bigger pain than any pain

3:29:47.080 --> 3:29:50.160
 you can experience in the fight.

3:29:50.160 --> 3:29:51.160
 That's pretty powerful.

3:29:51.160 --> 3:29:55.440
 But what about the violence of, I mean, you don't have that on your face, but like, I

3:29:55.440 --> 3:29:59.320
 don't know if you've also seen Tyson talk about, he was on Rogan recently and he was

3:29:59.320 --> 3:30:08.800
 talking about, he was trying to psychoanalyze himself about why he enjoys violence so much.

3:30:08.800 --> 3:30:10.680
 I mean, he called it orgasmic.

3:30:10.680 --> 3:30:13.680
 I don't know if, have you seen that clip?

3:30:13.680 --> 3:30:14.680
 I haven't.

3:30:14.680 --> 3:30:15.680
 Okay.

3:30:15.680 --> 3:30:19.840
 We're playing it because I can, I need to, because Trump also retweeted it, which is

3:30:19.840 --> 3:30:20.840
 hilarious.

3:30:20.840 --> 3:30:28.880
 I don't know how to contextualize that our president retweeted the clip of Tyson saying...

3:30:28.880 --> 3:30:32.400
 Maybe he's just doing like, they're not, it's like, I'm going to throw him a curve ball.

3:30:32.400 --> 3:30:33.800
 No one's going to have any idea what that is.

3:30:33.800 --> 3:30:36.360
 But yeah, he did no explanation, just, here you go.

3:30:36.360 --> 3:30:37.360
 There you go.

3:30:37.360 --> 3:30:39.560
 Well, I think that's kind of like what you were describing.

3:30:39.560 --> 3:30:41.800
 It's like, if I give you an answer, it has to be a good one.

3:30:41.800 --> 3:30:43.720
 Better to just let your imagination run.

3:30:43.720 --> 3:30:44.720
 Exactly.

3:30:44.720 --> 3:30:45.720
 Yeah.

3:30:45.720 --> 3:30:48.720
 He's like the Kubrick of our time.

3:30:48.720 --> 3:30:58.160
 Now what's really interesting that sometimes, period, it's not real, but sometimes I struggle

3:30:58.160 --> 3:31:02.120
 with the fact of why there's a possibility I can really hurt somebody.

3:31:02.120 --> 3:31:06.400
 Like you don't want to hurt them.

3:31:06.400 --> 3:31:10.720
 What do you mean when you struggle with the possibility that you could hurt them?

3:31:10.720 --> 3:31:15.480
 That is sometimes, it's orgasmic sometimes.

3:31:15.480 --> 3:31:17.120
 Yeah.

3:31:17.120 --> 3:31:23.280
 Like some fights, like particular, like Tyrell Biggs or someone that you had problems with,

3:31:23.280 --> 3:31:26.920
 someone that you, you had animosity towards.

3:31:26.920 --> 3:31:29.680
 So when you finally get your hands on them.

3:31:29.680 --> 3:31:36.360
 Hey, what does it mean when fighting gets you, gets you erect?

3:31:36.360 --> 3:31:37.360
 What does that mean?

3:31:37.360 --> 3:31:40.040
 It's a good question.

3:31:40.040 --> 3:31:41.680
 Means you're getting excited.

3:31:41.680 --> 3:31:42.880
 Yeah.

3:31:42.880 --> 3:31:45.360
 So that, that's going through your mind right now.

3:31:45.360 --> 3:31:50.300
 Well, that's how I get when I was a kid and I, you know, sometimes I get the twinkle.

3:31:50.300 --> 3:31:51.300
 The twinkle.

3:31:51.300 --> 3:31:52.300
 Yeah.

3:31:52.300 --> 3:31:53.300
 Well, that's what I'm saying.

3:31:53.300 --> 3:31:58.480
 When you reached a state as a human being, as a champion, as a ferocious fighter, you

3:31:58.480 --> 3:32:04.880
 reached a state of, of ability and of accomplishment that very few humans will ever, ever touch

3:32:04.880 --> 3:32:06.380
 and feel.

3:32:06.380 --> 3:32:10.360
 That's why I'm asking you when you're running, when you're hitting the bag, when that heart's

3:32:10.360 --> 3:32:15.080
 beating again and that you know who you are, you're Mike motherfucking Tyson.

3:32:15.080 --> 3:32:17.840
 So when you're doing all this shit again, you're still Mike Tyson.

3:32:17.840 --> 3:32:20.840
 Those thoughts have got to be burning inside you again.

3:32:20.840 --> 3:32:23.480
 It's got to be pretty wild.

3:32:23.480 --> 3:32:26.360
 I don't know.

3:32:26.360 --> 3:32:31.600
 It's wild, but I believe it's rightfully so to be that way.

3:32:31.600 --> 3:32:36.240
 And I used to know how to, I don't say I'm master, but I used to know how to deal with

3:32:36.240 --> 3:32:37.240
 it.

3:32:37.240 --> 3:32:38.240
 I don't let it overwhelm me.

3:32:38.240 --> 3:32:45.320
 I mean, he goes on to try to, they don't ever, like Joe doesn't bite.

3:32:45.320 --> 3:32:51.720
 The interesting thing about that conversation is Mike was trying to figure himself out.

3:32:51.720 --> 3:32:59.720
 Like he's trying on the spot, like, why do I feel this way?

3:32:59.720 --> 3:33:08.560
 To me it was like, to me it's so real and honest to feel like pleasure from hurting

3:33:08.560 --> 3:33:10.220
 somebody.

3:33:10.220 --> 3:33:13.720
 Like that you rarely hear that.

3:33:13.720 --> 3:33:22.720
 In this society, it's like, you rarely like talk about like you feel pleasure from winning.

3:33:22.720 --> 3:33:29.320
 You feel pleasure from like the relief of overcoming like all the stress you had to

3:33:29.320 --> 3:33:31.120
 go through.

3:33:31.120 --> 3:33:37.280
 Pleasure from just like the specifics of the fight, the techniques you use, the maybe

3:33:37.280 --> 3:33:42.400
 overcoming being down a couple of rounds, but like how often do you hear somebody say,

3:33:42.400 --> 3:33:46.760
 I just enjoyed, he's not even saying because I hate the opponent.

3:33:46.760 --> 3:33:51.440
 He's saying like, I enjoyed purely the violence of it.

3:33:51.440 --> 3:33:52.800
 That's crazy.

3:33:52.800 --> 3:33:56.160
 I mean, I don't know, it's honest.

3:33:56.160 --> 3:34:00.120
 It made me ask, like, I wonder how many of us are cognizant of that.

3:34:00.120 --> 3:34:05.560
 Let's say Mike is uncommonly seemingly honest.

3:34:05.560 --> 3:34:09.840
 I think athletes make a full time job out of lying, you know, I think people make a

3:34:09.840 --> 3:34:10.840
 full time job.

3:34:10.840 --> 3:34:11.840
 To themselves perhaps too.

3:34:11.840 --> 3:34:16.280
 I mean, in some, you tell yourself or you tell others what you feel you need to, or

3:34:16.280 --> 3:34:20.320
 maybe whether you've, whether you even know what you feel you need to, but why should

3:34:20.320 --> 3:34:25.600
 he not, I mean, again, did he, did he run up and just hit somebody that's didn't sign

3:34:25.600 --> 3:34:26.600
 up for this?

3:34:26.600 --> 3:34:28.720
 No, they, they signed up to be there.

3:34:28.720 --> 3:34:35.640
 Well, that's the interesting thing about Dyson is there's that weird, uh, like nonstandard

3:34:35.640 --> 3:34:36.640
 behavior.

3:34:36.640 --> 3:34:40.560
 I mean, like your fighting style is not standard.

3:34:40.560 --> 3:34:47.200
 He's nonstandard to another degree of like, uh, who else has that in Jiu Jitsu, uh, uh,

3:34:47.200 --> 3:34:55.000
 Polaris, uh, uh, has this kind of weirdness, like what's, what's in there?

3:34:55.000 --> 3:35:01.200
 Like there's a fear that I think, uh, most opponents would have because it's like, it's

3:35:01.200 --> 3:35:06.440
 no longer about like, it takes you out of the realm of its game.

3:35:06.440 --> 3:35:11.360
 It takes us back to the thing we were talking about, like before is it strips away that

3:35:11.360 --> 3:35:17.680
 like several layers of Ryan Hall, the, the podcast, uh, guest, Ryan Hall, the Jiu Jitsu

3:35:17.680 --> 3:35:22.040
 instructor, Ryan Hall, Jiu Jitsu competitor, it keeps going down to a point where like

3:35:22.040 --> 3:35:27.920
 Ryan Hall, the murderer of all things that get in his way that lies underneath all of

3:35:27.920 --> 3:35:28.920
 it.

3:35:28.920 --> 3:35:33.280
 Seemingly like if we're like in this society, we put all that aside, but it makes you wonder

3:35:33.280 --> 3:35:38.880
 like now as society is being tested in many ways, it makes you wonder like what's underneath

3:35:38.880 --> 3:35:39.880
 there.

3:35:39.880 --> 3:35:41.760
 Well, do we want, do we want the answer to that?

3:35:41.760 --> 3:35:42.760
 Cause I guess it's, what is it?

3:35:42.760 --> 3:35:46.600
 Uh, you seem Paul Fiction, you know, the best character in the movie and in the best scene

3:35:46.600 --> 3:35:49.520
 in the movie is like, if my questions here, if you're, what do you call it?

3:35:49.520 --> 3:35:53.000
 If my answer is scary, you should cease asking scary questions, you know?

3:35:53.000 --> 3:35:57.040
 And I guess, uh, you wonder, I mean, all of us, that's something that I think it's funny

3:35:57.040 --> 3:36:03.480
 we go, that's not okay, I mean, versus maybe not appropriate for situation X, Y, or Z.

3:36:03.480 --> 3:36:07.640
 But uh, what should make any of us think, I mean, humanity is a different place now.

3:36:07.640 --> 3:36:10.460
 And I mean, I'm not saying anything crazy out there, but humanity is a different place

3:36:10.460 --> 3:36:15.920
 now than we were 5,000 years ago where all of us are descended from people who have killed

3:36:15.920 --> 3:36:20.720
 things with their teeth and fingernails in order to be where we are.

3:36:20.720 --> 3:36:24.320
 And whether it was in, whether it was an animal or it was in conflict with another person,

3:36:24.320 --> 3:36:28.960
 I mean, think about the, the chances of dying by violence now are so, so slim, at least

3:36:28.960 --> 3:36:32.840
 in most countries in most plays, like shockingly small, thankfully.

3:36:32.840 --> 3:36:36.920
 But there was a period of time, like the most period of time where dying by violence was

3:36:36.920 --> 3:36:39.120
 mostly how it went down.

3:36:39.120 --> 3:36:44.520
 And I guess what would be facilitative, what would allow you to win back to Ender's game?

3:36:44.520 --> 3:36:49.800
 You know, what allows you, if you can't do that, you are all, you are forever subject

3:36:49.800 --> 3:36:54.600
 to people who can, and that's, that's a real thing.

3:36:54.600 --> 3:36:58.200
 And you know, we're fortunate to find ourselves in a situation where we don't, where other

3:36:58.200 --> 3:36:59.400
 things matter.

3:36:59.400 --> 3:37:02.840
 But that is a funny thing periodically where people, you'll see people kind of drawn at

3:37:02.840 --> 3:37:06.920
 each other, like in videos or out in the world that clearly neither of them expect this to

3:37:06.920 --> 3:37:07.920
 get serious.

3:37:07.920 --> 3:37:08.920
 Like, I'm just going to yell at you.

3:37:08.920 --> 3:37:09.920
 You're going to yell at me.

3:37:09.920 --> 3:37:11.840
 And it's like this weird LARPing thing where we're both going to go on our own separate

3:37:11.840 --> 3:37:12.840
 way.

3:37:12.840 --> 3:37:15.800
 All it takes is one person to be like, well, I wasn't kidding.

3:37:15.800 --> 3:37:16.800
 And it's like, well, you'll go to jail.

3:37:16.800 --> 3:37:20.040
 And it's like, oh, I know you're going to go to the morgue.

3:37:20.040 --> 3:37:22.560
 And it's, that's, but that can happen like that.

3:37:22.560 --> 3:37:23.560
 Like society.

3:37:23.560 --> 3:37:26.280
 I mean, obviously, anyway, you could jump across the table, stab me in the eye.

3:37:26.280 --> 3:37:29.520
 I mean, I appreciate, I'd hope if you don't, and there will be consequences if you do,

3:37:29.520 --> 3:37:34.080
 but not from, not from me, from, from the rest of society will potentially get you at

3:37:34.080 --> 3:37:38.880
 a certain point, but you can decide to not play by the rules anytime you want.

3:37:38.880 --> 3:37:43.320
 It's fascinating that, yeah, that's, we've created rules based on which we all behave,

3:37:43.320 --> 3:37:49.400
 but underneath there, you know, there, there's things that doesn't, there's motivations and

3:37:49.400 --> 3:37:54.800
 forces that don't play by the rules and still there nature is metal is under the surface.

3:37:54.800 --> 3:37:55.800
 Seriously.

3:37:55.800 --> 3:37:59.200
 And again, I pull out my phone and I'm basically saying like, Hey, I'm going to, you're going

3:37:59.200 --> 3:38:00.200
 to get caught.

3:38:00.200 --> 3:38:01.200
 Yeah.

3:38:01.200 --> 3:38:03.360
 But really I'm further antagonizing you rightly or wrongly.

3:38:03.360 --> 3:38:04.360
 You know what I mean?

3:38:04.360 --> 3:38:05.920
 Like, and that, that's an interesting thing.

3:38:05.920 --> 3:38:10.920
 And I feel like just people need to remember any of us need to remember just for any reason,

3:38:10.920 --> 3:38:15.560
 just that's, that's one step away at all, at all times you ever, I've had people say

3:38:15.560 --> 3:38:17.360
 to me before, like, Oh, I don't feel safe.

3:38:17.360 --> 3:38:18.360
 I'm like, you're not safe.

3:38:18.360 --> 3:38:20.440
 I kill you before you get out of this room.

3:38:20.440 --> 3:38:21.440
 Nothing you do to stop that.

3:38:21.440 --> 3:38:22.440
 Nothing.

3:38:22.440 --> 3:38:23.440
 I mean, but don't worry.

3:38:23.440 --> 3:38:26.240
 You can do the same to me, which means I'm like, Oh, Oh, thank goodness.

3:38:26.240 --> 3:38:29.560
 Can you imagine like how many guns are there are in this country?

3:38:29.560 --> 3:38:33.560
 Like I mean, everywhere, I mean, seriously everywhere, but that's a heartening thought.

3:38:33.560 --> 3:38:34.560
 Not the other way.

3:38:34.560 --> 3:38:37.200
 Cause people usually freak out and go, Oh my God, gun violence, gun violence, gun violence

3:38:37.200 --> 3:38:41.920
 is like really not a serious issue in the United States compared to what it could be.

3:38:41.920 --> 3:38:45.920
 Because it means that, I mean, with the amount of guns and the amount of bullets that are

3:38:45.920 --> 3:38:50.920
 out there that are in circulation, can you imagine if like one in every thousand was

3:38:50.920 --> 3:38:52.240
 used in anger each day?

3:38:52.240 --> 3:38:54.880
 I mean, this would be a terrifying place to live.

3:38:54.880 --> 3:38:55.880
 You couldn't go anywhere.

3:38:55.880 --> 3:38:59.700
 So, I mean, although you could say, Hey, this is more than we'd like or X, Y, Z, it actually

3:38:59.700 --> 3:39:04.240
 means that people are much more reasonable and sane than we're saying then, or then I,

3:39:04.240 --> 3:39:06.320
 then sometimes I might, my might argue.

3:39:06.320 --> 3:39:09.920
 So I guess what I mean is like, Oh man, I walked a seven 11 and I didn't get stabbed.

3:39:09.920 --> 3:39:13.960
 I'm like, Oh, well that's good because not because I protected myself with my karate.

3:39:13.960 --> 3:39:18.200
 It's basically no one decided to run over and stab me because I wasn't protecting myself.

3:39:18.200 --> 3:39:19.760
 It's I, they, they stopped.

3:39:19.760 --> 3:39:23.760
 So I guess we're all fortunate to live in a society that, that like you said, nature

3:39:23.760 --> 3:39:26.280
 being metal doesn't become that big of an issue all the time.

3:39:26.280 --> 3:39:29.620
 But it is funny when you get people in the ring and you go, Hey, let's peel back from

3:39:29.620 --> 3:39:34.080
 Mr. Tyson, many layers of that and say, Hey, now it's okay.

3:39:34.080 --> 3:39:37.480
 And it's cool that, I mean, that's what society is doing.

3:39:37.480 --> 3:39:44.480
 So I've lived in Harvard square for awhile and we add extra layers of what safe means.

3:39:44.480 --> 3:39:51.280
 Like now there's a disc discourse about safe spaces, about like ideas being violence or,

3:39:51.280 --> 3:39:58.220
 or like, uh, you know, like, yeah, but ideas are minor slights against your personality

3:39:58.220 --> 3:39:59.600
 being violence.

3:39:59.600 --> 3:40:05.840
 And that's all like extra layers around the nature is metal thing that, uh, it's cool.

3:40:05.840 --> 3:40:06.840
 That's what progress is.

3:40:06.840 --> 3:40:13.080
 But we can't forget that like underneath it is still, it's still the, the thing that will

3:40:13.080 --> 3:40:17.560
 murder at the, at the drop of, uh, in any, at any moment.

3:40:17.560 --> 3:40:23.160
 If uh, if aroused one, one thing that I find funny though, or ironic maybe about the, uh,

3:40:23.160 --> 3:40:27.480
 the, you know, words of violence, you know, offenses, violence thing is that of course

3:40:27.480 --> 3:40:33.680
 that if that, the belief in that then justifies my violence, like my, and whether it may be

3:40:33.680 --> 3:40:38.160
 in my, maybe not physical violence, but my response to my, my aggressive response to

3:40:38.160 --> 3:40:39.160
 things.

3:40:39.160 --> 3:40:42.840
 And I guess like, which it can be regrets of begets a further aggressive response and

3:40:42.840 --> 3:40:47.920
 like a, you know, kind of a tit for tat sort of situation or, or it goes to like, well,

3:40:47.920 --> 3:40:50.960
 there's 10 of me and there's one of you, so we'll get you and you can't do anything about

3:40:50.960 --> 3:40:51.960
 it.

3:40:51.960 --> 3:40:52.960
 But that's not morality.

3:40:52.960 --> 3:40:55.360
 That's, that's just saying that's might makes right.

3:40:55.360 --> 3:40:58.860
 So I guess again, you can understand why people do it and there are certain, there is a progress

3:40:58.860 --> 3:41:00.320
 aspect to it.

3:41:00.320 --> 3:41:06.120
 But again, I guess without proper examination, I'm effectively with my 10 friends, you know,

3:41:06.120 --> 3:41:10.320
 and, and the force of the law, Mike Tyson and people, but not admitting to myself what

3:41:10.320 --> 3:41:11.320
 I'm doing.

3:41:11.320 --> 3:41:13.920
 And at least Mike Tyson again is honest.

3:41:13.920 --> 3:41:16.320
 Are you, uh, afraid of death?

3:41:16.320 --> 3:41:21.280
 I mean, it's easy for me to say no, as I sit here, probably not about to die, but.

3:41:21.280 --> 3:41:24.200
 Is this like the UFC question, can you defeat any opponent?

3:41:24.200 --> 3:41:26.840
 The answer is of course, yes.

3:41:26.840 --> 3:41:29.680
 And uh, I don't have, they're not around, they're not here, are they?

3:41:29.680 --> 3:41:30.680
 Yeah, exactly.

3:41:30.680 --> 3:41:33.700
 But, uh, I mean, are you, uh, do you ponder your own mortality?

3:41:33.700 --> 3:41:39.040
 Maybe another context to that is you mentioned two deaths for martial artists.

3:41:39.040 --> 3:41:42.800
 I think that's actually why, honestly, even though at a relatively young age, I think

3:41:42.800 --> 3:41:46.360
 mortality is something that I'm aware of more, maybe more than the average person.

3:41:46.360 --> 3:41:50.640
 I think probably most athletes can speak to this and anyone that's had trouble, I've managed

3:41:50.640 --> 3:41:55.440
 to just slide out of a couple of near death experiences personally, you know, mostly river

3:41:55.440 --> 3:42:01.480
 related, um, because I'm an idiot, but, um, I regret nothing, but, uh, yeah, but, uh,

3:42:01.480 --> 3:42:02.480
 thank God we're here.

3:42:02.480 --> 3:42:10.160
 But, um, yeah, it is an interest seeing, seeing the end and seeing going, well, what's going

3:42:10.160 --> 3:42:11.160
 to happen.

3:42:11.160 --> 3:42:14.840
 I guess I think it comes back to kind of what we're discussing about belief structure and

3:42:14.840 --> 3:42:15.980
 belief system.

3:42:15.980 --> 3:42:21.120
 I think a lot of times, if I recognize that no matter what I do, it's all going to end

3:42:21.120 --> 3:42:23.760
 one day and then you go, well, why were we here?

3:42:23.760 --> 3:42:24.760
 What would I do?

3:42:24.760 --> 3:42:26.280
 Am I going to make it to 40?

3:42:26.280 --> 3:42:27.280
 I have no idea.

3:42:27.280 --> 3:42:31.240
 I'd like to hope so that I had no idea that I was going to make it to the age that I am

3:42:31.240 --> 3:42:32.240
 now.

3:42:32.240 --> 3:42:33.720
 Um, am I going to make it to 80?

3:42:33.720 --> 3:42:36.740
 How much of that is in my control?

3:42:36.740 --> 3:42:37.740
 Much of it is not.

3:42:37.740 --> 3:42:38.820
 I mean, it's so funny.

3:42:38.820 --> 3:42:42.140
 It's an interesting, like back to the belief structure again, like locus of internal and

3:42:42.140 --> 3:42:44.000
 external locus of control.

3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:47.600
 You know, what's facilitative versus what's true.

3:42:47.600 --> 3:42:51.760
 And you know, I think accepting personal responsibility for more than is on my control is, is probably

3:42:51.760 --> 3:42:57.800
 a positive, but at the same time, recognizing that much of much is not in my control.

3:42:57.800 --> 3:43:02.440
 I was fortunate enough to be born in the United States, fortunate enough to, you know, to

3:43:02.440 --> 3:43:06.560
 not knock on wood, have, have a serious disease that I'm not aware of right now.

3:43:06.560 --> 3:43:08.280
 Um, I didn't do any of that.

3:43:08.280 --> 3:43:09.880
 I just showed up.

3:43:09.880 --> 3:43:11.400
 That was really fortunate.

3:43:11.400 --> 3:43:17.120
 And I guess that doesn't diminish the fact that I've tried to make decent choices, but

3:43:17.120 --> 3:43:18.560
 it works in concert with it.

3:43:18.560 --> 3:43:24.280
 And I, I guess, um, when I, when you go, is death what I want right now?

3:43:24.280 --> 3:43:26.400
 No, no, I should think not.

3:43:26.400 --> 3:43:30.520
 And again, it's easier for me to be relatively calm about as I'm not staring it in the face,

3:43:30.520 --> 3:43:35.800
 but what I would care a lot more about is, is how you live.

3:43:35.800 --> 3:43:37.320
 That's what's in my control.

3:43:37.320 --> 3:43:41.760
 And I can't control if, as I walk out of this building, a helicopter falls on me worrying

3:43:41.760 --> 3:43:42.760
 about that.

3:43:42.760 --> 3:43:43.760
 I can't control it.

3:43:43.760 --> 3:43:46.600
 Maybe I, maybe I have cancer now and I don't know it and I really hope not.

3:43:46.600 --> 3:43:47.600
 But um,

3:43:47.600 --> 3:43:51.680
 there's something about meditating on the fact that it could end today outside of your

3:43:51.680 --> 3:43:58.560
 control that can clarify your thinking about the, the fact that life is amazing, like just

3:43:58.560 --> 3:44:01.680
 kind of, yeah, helping you enjoy this moment.

3:44:01.680 --> 3:44:05.760
 Even if life was horrible, let's say for instance, it was, it was, you live at one of those times

3:44:05.760 --> 3:44:11.280
 or places and this place is still exists in this world today that life is brutal and metal

3:44:11.280 --> 3:44:14.640
 and whatever all and short and painful.

3:44:14.640 --> 3:44:15.960
 Would you still want it?

3:44:15.960 --> 3:44:20.480
 And again, as I'm sitting here and not, not on fire physically, it's easy to say yes,

3:44:20.480 --> 3:44:25.680
 but I would, I'm confident I still I'll plant my feet and say yes, any of, any life is amazing

3:44:25.680 --> 3:44:31.080
 and beautiful and a gift and unbelievable gift, uh, that none of us have earned for

3:44:31.080 --> 3:44:32.080
 the record.

3:44:32.080 --> 3:44:35.040
 We're, I hate the word earned a lot of times earned yet you earn, but it's like, there's

3:44:35.040 --> 3:44:37.160
 a lot of, a lot of good fortune and earning.

3:44:37.160 --> 3:44:41.160
 And that's back to, do I want justice or do I want grace?

3:44:41.160 --> 3:44:44.360
 And I guess we're all fortunate to be where we are, no matter where we are.

3:44:44.360 --> 3:44:48.360
 And hopefully it should give us some sense of perspective, some sense of compassion for

3:44:48.360 --> 3:44:49.360
 other people.

3:44:49.360 --> 3:44:54.440
 But also like, like you said, a sense of peace, if it all ended right now, would I be happy

3:44:54.440 --> 3:44:56.200
 with what I, with life to this point?

3:44:56.200 --> 3:44:58.680
 I'm like, of course, would you like to live a little longer?

3:44:58.680 --> 3:44:59.680
 Yeah.

3:44:59.680 --> 3:45:03.920
 I would try to do more and try to live rightly to the best that I know how, which over time

3:45:03.920 --> 3:45:07.540
 will hopefully continue to evolve in a, in a positive direction.

3:45:07.540 --> 3:45:14.440
 But if the answer to that is no, I guess, uh, that's, that's always, that's a sign that,

3:45:14.440 --> 3:45:16.400
 that what I'm doing is not what I'm meant to be doing.

3:45:16.400 --> 3:45:21.120
 And I mean, you're familiar with the Tecumseh before, uh, so there's a, I've got one actually,

3:45:21.120 --> 3:45:23.720
 if you could give me 10 seconds, I'll, I'll read this one out.

3:45:23.720 --> 3:45:26.520
 This is a personal favorite basically.

3:45:26.520 --> 3:45:29.940
 And I think it sums up, I mean, again, like it's one of those quotes on the internet,

3:45:29.940 --> 3:45:32.600
 like when Abraham Lincoln said, don't believe everything you read online.

3:45:32.600 --> 3:45:38.140
 Um, but, uh, this is, you know, I, it's again, uh, attributed, but it's like, so live your

3:45:38.140 --> 3:45:42.840
 life that the fear of death can never enter your heart, trouble, no one about their religion,

3:45:42.840 --> 3:45:46.960
 respect others in their view and demand that they respect yours, love your life, perfect

3:45:46.960 --> 3:45:49.800
 your life and beautify all things in your life.

3:45:49.800 --> 3:45:53.480
 Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people.

3:45:53.480 --> 3:45:54.940
 Prepare a noble death song for the day.

3:45:54.940 --> 3:45:58.980
 When you go over the great divide, always give a word or sign of salute when meeting

3:45:58.980 --> 3:46:03.080
 or passing a friend, even a stranger when in a lonely place.

3:46:03.080 --> 3:46:06.200
 Show respect to all people and grovel to none.

3:46:06.200 --> 3:46:10.060
 When you arise in the morning, give thanks for the food and for the joy of living.

3:46:10.060 --> 3:46:13.940
 If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourself.

3:46:13.940 --> 3:46:17.680
 Abuse no one and no thing for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the spirit

3:46:17.680 --> 3:46:19.280
 of its vision.

3:46:19.280 --> 3:46:22.440
 When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear

3:46:22.440 --> 3:46:26.200
 of death so that when their time comes, they weep and pray for a little more time to live

3:46:26.200 --> 3:46:28.960
 their lives over again in a different way.

3:46:28.960 --> 3:46:32.200
 Sing your death song and die like a hero going home.

3:46:32.200 --> 3:46:33.200
 Powerful words.

3:46:33.200 --> 3:46:35.280
 I don't think there's a better way to end it.

3:46:35.280 --> 3:46:40.160
 Let me just say, we've spoke maybe five, six years ago.

3:46:40.160 --> 3:46:46.180
 I don't even remember when, but I'm not exaggerating saying like you had a huge impact on my life

3:46:46.180 --> 3:46:47.640
 because of the podcast.

3:46:47.640 --> 3:46:52.200
 You're the reason I was doing the podcast as long as I have.

3:46:52.200 --> 3:46:55.560
 You're the reason I'm doing this podcast.

3:46:55.560 --> 3:46:59.160
 It's a little, it's a stupid little meeting that you probably didn't know who I was.

3:46:59.160 --> 3:47:00.880
 I didn't really know who you are.

3:47:00.880 --> 3:47:02.360
 It was just like a magical moment.

3:47:02.360 --> 3:47:05.800
 It's a flap of a butterfly wing kind of situation.

3:47:05.800 --> 3:47:07.760
 And yeah, I'm forever grateful.

3:47:07.760 --> 3:47:11.120
 You're one of the most inspiring people in my life.

3:47:11.120 --> 3:47:15.200
 So Ryan, it's a huge honor that you would come here.

3:47:15.200 --> 3:47:18.520
 Jen didn't talk with me and waste all this time.

3:47:18.520 --> 3:47:19.520
 I really appreciate it.

3:47:19.520 --> 3:47:20.580
 It was amazing.

3:47:20.580 --> 3:47:21.580
 Thank you so much, Alexis.

3:47:21.580 --> 3:47:22.580
 It's just been a pleasure.

3:47:22.580 --> 3:47:23.580
 I really appreciate you having us on.

3:47:23.580 --> 3:47:24.580

 And now let me leave you with some words from Frank Herbert in Dune.

3:47:52.300 --> 3:47:57.280
 Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense.

3:47:57.280 --> 3:48:01.880
 But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.

3:48:01.880 --> 3:48:23.000
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
