00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
 The following is a conversation between me and Michael Malus.

00:04.880 --> 00:12.120
 Michael is an author, anarchist, and simpleton, and I'm proud to call him my friend.

00:12.120 --> 00:19.120
 He makes me smile, he makes me think, and he makes me wonder why I sound so sleepy all

00:19.120 --> 00:20.560
 the time.

00:20.560 --> 00:27.800
 And now, enjoy this conversation with Michael Malus in the Tupagalovi language that I'm

00:27.800 --> 00:32.160
 increasingly certain I'll never quite able to get the hang of.

00:32.160 --> 00:36.440
 Hello, comrade.

00:36.440 --> 00:40.880
 So Animal Farm by George Orwell is one of my favorite books.

00:40.880 --> 00:46.600
 It's an allegory about, at least I think, about the Soviet Union and the Russian Revolution

00:46.600 --> 00:48.840
 of 1917.

00:48.840 --> 00:54.360
 So for people who haven't read it, it's animals overthrow the humans and then slowly become

00:54.360 --> 00:57.680
 as bad or worse than the humans.

00:57.680 --> 01:04.280
 So comrade, if we lived on this farm, in the book Animal Farm, which animal would you most

01:04.280 --> 01:06.480
 rather be?

01:06.480 --> 01:13.840
 Would it be the pigs, the horses, the donkey Benjamin, the raven Moses, the humans, Mr.

01:13.840 --> 01:17.120
 and Mrs. Jones, the dogs, or the sheep?

01:17.120 --> 01:22.960
 I'm gonna go with the Milton answer, which is it's better to rule in hell than serve

01:22.960 --> 01:24.360
 in heaven, right?

01:24.360 --> 01:27.000
 It's better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.800
 Yeah, so I would have to go with the pigs.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.280
 So I guess I'd be a cop.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.280
 At the very top.

01:33.280 --> 01:37.200
 So the leader, the main pig, Napoleon versus like the others.

01:37.200 --> 01:42.640
 I would say it's not, it's sure it's an allegory about the Russian Revolution, but I think

01:42.640 --> 01:46.280
 Orwell's point was this is broader towards most totalitarian dictatorships.

01:46.280 --> 01:50.720
 I mean, it could very easily be read as an indictment of Mussolini or Hitler, or many

01:50.720 --> 01:51.720
 of these others.

01:51.720 --> 01:55.340
 I'm a huge George Orwell fan.

01:55.340 --> 02:01.560
 One of the things that I think people on the right need to appreciate is the courage of

02:01.560 --> 02:09.360
 many of these undisputably left wing voices who were the strongest ones to take on totalitarian

02:09.360 --> 02:10.360
 communism.

02:10.360 --> 02:15.020
 And the three I could think of top of my head who are all in my top 10 heroes of all time

02:15.020 --> 02:20.600
 are Emma Goldman, Albert Camus, and Orwell being the third.

02:20.600 --> 02:25.160
 Something that leftists like to throw in the face of people on the right who constantly

02:25.160 --> 02:29.200
 invoke Orwell is that Orwell said, and I don't have the exact quote off the top of my head,

02:29.200 --> 02:34.440
 but something to the effect of every word I have written should be taken as a defense

02:34.440 --> 02:37.360
 of democratic socialism against totalitarianism.

02:37.360 --> 02:44.280
 So people like Truman was obviously very hardcore, in many ways anti communist.

02:44.280 --> 02:51.920
 We like to parse things out, you're going to laugh, into binary fashions that left good,

02:51.920 --> 02:53.760
 right bad, or right good, left bad.

02:53.760 --> 02:58.720
 But historically speaking, it would just not fall away into these camps as easily as people

02:58.720 --> 03:00.560
 would like.

03:00.560 --> 03:06.680
 And I think it is important for those of us, it takes a lot more courage to fight the right

03:06.680 --> 03:12.120
 from the right or to fight the left from the left, because in a sense, a lot of your countrymen

03:12.120 --> 03:15.700
 or your fellow travelers are going to regard you as a traitor to the cause.

03:15.700 --> 03:21.880
 So every chance I get, I will sing the praises of these three figures, among others, who

03:21.880 --> 03:27.320
 not all even if they hadn't done what they had done, just lived just amazing lives that

03:27.320 --> 03:34.440
 all of us can learn from and admire and regard as somewhat a role model.

03:34.440 --> 03:35.440
 So

03:35.440 --> 03:38.760
 what was the nature of their opposition to totalitarianism?

03:38.760 --> 03:42.560
 Is it basically freedom, the value of freedom?

03:42.560 --> 03:43.840
 Let's go through the three of them.

03:43.840 --> 03:47.720
 So Emma Goldman, she was an early anarchist figure, you know, we'll talk about her later,

03:47.720 --> 03:52.840
 I'm sure she got deported from the United States with her partner in crime, Alexander

03:52.840 --> 03:58.560
 Birkman, literal crime, he tried to assassinate Frick, who was Andrew Carnegie's main man

03:58.560 --> 04:00.900
 in the Pittsburgh steel mill strike.

04:00.900 --> 04:03.600
 She got deported to the Soviet Union.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.580
 And they're like, oh, you want socialism?

04:05.580 --> 04:09.260
 Because at the time, the anarchists were regarded as socialist, you know, go choke on it.

04:09.260 --> 04:10.620
 And she's there.

04:10.620 --> 04:13.600
 And she was watching in great horror what was going on.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.880
 And she actually went to Lenin's office and she goes, this isn't what we're about.

04:16.880 --> 04:21.080
 The revolution is about the individual and free speech and everyone working together

04:21.080 --> 04:23.000
 to further society.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.780
 And he told her that, you know, you know, free speech is a bourgeois contrivance.

04:26.780 --> 04:30.760
 And regardless, you can't have these circumstances in the midst of a revolution.

04:30.760 --> 04:34.240
 And when she left the Soviet Union, and you know, she went to Britain.

04:34.240 --> 04:40.400
 And at the time, before the 1917, there was a lot of discussion among socialist circles

04:40.400 --> 04:42.760
 about what would the revolution look like, right?

04:42.760 --> 04:44.640
 Would there be the Bakunin anarchist model?

04:44.640 --> 04:46.120
 Would there be the Marxist model?

04:46.120 --> 04:48.260
 Obviously, the Bolsheviks ended up winning.

04:48.260 --> 04:51.640
 But even then, it wasn't obvious because there was the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.500
 And what people, you know, you and I know what those words mean.

04:54.500 --> 04:59.160
 But Bolsheviks were kind of funny because Bolsheviks means bigger and Mensheviks means

04:59.160 --> 05:00.160
 smaller.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.480
 The Mensheviks had the numbers.

05:01.480 --> 05:06.260
 It was sarcastic that they were called Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks were called Bolsheviks.

05:06.260 --> 05:11.560
 And Lenin, you know, destroyed all his foes in a very merciless way, obviously.

05:11.560 --> 05:15.520
 Beforehand, you know, there was the idea like, okay, with all these cockamamie ideas, we

05:15.520 --> 05:17.100
 have to work together.

05:17.100 --> 05:19.000
 You know, we don't know what's going to look like for the cause.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.360
 Then as soon as he sees power, he's like, yeah, yeah, we're not doing that kind of pluralism

05:22.360 --> 05:23.360
 anymore.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.840
 This is going to be the right approach.

05:25.840 --> 05:29.040
 So she left the Soviet Union, as did Berkman.

05:29.040 --> 05:32.480
 She wrote a book that they titled, My Disillusion with Russia.

05:32.480 --> 05:36.280
 And I remember this one anecdote, which I'm going to discuss in the forthcoming book,

05:36.280 --> 05:40.940
 where she goes to Britain and the British were very red at the time, they really had

05:40.940 --> 05:44.040
 something called the Fabian Society, which was the predecessor to the British Labour

05:44.040 --> 05:49.080
 Party, which were like, all right, we're going to get rid of liberalism and have a socialist

05:49.080 --> 05:50.900
 kind of nation.

05:50.900 --> 05:55.320
 And she gave talks, and there was this one time where she gave a talk and she started,

05:55.320 --> 05:58.860
 and there was a standing ovation, by the time she was done, you could hear a pin drop, because

05:58.860 --> 06:03.720
 she dared to look at these people in the face, something they'd been fighting for all their

06:03.720 --> 06:07.060
 lives and saying, you know, we've been to the future and it works.

06:07.060 --> 06:10.220
 And she's like, guys, this is worse than the czar.

06:10.220 --> 06:13.740
 You know, people are under house arrest, you're not allowed to have, you know, newspapers

06:13.740 --> 06:16.920
 are being shut down if they have heretical views, so on and so forth.

06:16.920 --> 06:20.560
 And you know, she was just even more of a pariah than she had been previously.

06:20.560 --> 06:24.600
 So she is, you know, deserves huge accolades in that regard.

06:24.600 --> 06:28.960
 I brought her up and we were talking about with our conversation with Yaron Orwell, I

06:28.960 --> 06:34.280
 think you don't need me to explain what he has done and continues to do to use fiction

06:34.280 --> 06:39.900
 to demonstrate the horrors of a totalitarian state.

06:39.900 --> 06:44.840
 And Camus, who might be my all time great lighthouse, so to speak, in terms of being

06:44.840 --> 06:48.560
 a man of conscience, you know, he joined the Communist Party and for a lot of people in

06:48.560 --> 06:51.680
 the States, you hear, oh, you joined the Communist Party, so I need to hear, it's all you need

06:51.680 --> 06:53.340
 to, he was a communist, all you need to know.

06:53.340 --> 06:56.840
 He joined the Communist Party because they were the main ones fighting the fascists in

06:56.840 --> 06:58.840
 France and other locations.

06:58.840 --> 07:03.240
 And he took Nazism, as did many others, of course, very, very, very seriously.

07:03.240 --> 07:08.780
 He wasn't some committed communist, but this was just his mechanism to take on, you know,

07:08.780 --> 07:11.720
 be part of the underground in Vichy France, and so on and so forth.

07:11.720 --> 07:17.360
 So he had the quote, which is ascribed to him, which is kind of a misquote, Howard Zinn

07:17.360 --> 07:21.080
 is the one who actually said it, that it is a job of thinking people not to be on the

07:21.080 --> 07:23.040
 side of the executioners.

07:23.040 --> 07:27.720
 And he very much felt, if you read his speech when he won the Nobel Prize, I forget, in

07:27.720 --> 07:33.840
 the 50s, where he goes, it's basically the job of writers to keep civilization from destroying

07:33.840 --> 07:34.840
 himself.

07:34.840 --> 07:39.160
 I don't think I'm ever going to be a man on the level of Camus and what he's accomplished,

07:39.160 --> 07:46.280
 but I think that vision of it is the job of writers to be the conscience and to point

07:46.280 --> 07:51.960
 out, you know, this is the leftism at its best when, you know, giving voice to the voiceless,

07:51.960 --> 07:56.660
 when you have the machine of the state crushing and marginalizing people, and they might not

07:56.660 --> 08:00.540
 be educated, literate, or have any power at all.

08:00.540 --> 08:06.400
 He's the guy who's like, you are ruining humans, these humans matter, and I'm not going to

08:06.400 --> 08:10.060
 let you look the other way and act like you don't know what you're doing.

08:10.060 --> 08:14.960
 So in this time, whether we look at the time of fascism, or we look at the fictional Animal

08:14.960 --> 08:17.940
 Farm, what's the heroic action then?

08:17.940 --> 08:23.560
 So Camus joined the Communist Party, there's a bunch of different heroic actions, some

08:23.560 --> 08:29.280
 more heroic than others, not just for the, you know, hero is the wrong word, in terms

08:29.280 --> 08:33.520
 of like effectiveness, what's the effective action, I guess is what I want to ask.

08:33.520 --> 08:38.400
 As a writer, as a thinker, as somebody with a mind, what's the heroic action?

08:38.400 --> 08:42.980
 That's a tricky question, because a lot of times in the West, heroism is regardless intertwined

08:42.980 --> 08:44.300
 with martyrdom, right?

08:44.300 --> 08:47.760
 So it's kind of this idea of like, you have to speak to, you know, Camus always talked

08:47.760 --> 08:50.540
 about justice, let justice be done though the heavens fall.

08:50.540 --> 08:55.080
 This is a common kind of motto among people with conscience, and that you have to do the

08:55.080 --> 08:58.100
 right thing, even the consequences might not be what you like.

08:58.100 --> 09:01.500
 And I think that is a good loose definition of heroism.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.960
 So if you meet, I'll give you one example of heroism.

09:03.960 --> 09:09.820
 This was on Twitter, and I really feel bad that I don't remember the guy's name.

09:09.820 --> 09:13.840
 This was the line to Auschwitz, I believe it was, and you know, there's the Nazi guards

09:13.840 --> 09:16.020
 keeping everyone along.

09:16.020 --> 09:19.820
 And if you were certain, I think if you were under 12, they killed you or something, there

09:19.820 --> 09:24.200
 was some age limit where some kids were killed or some were not, there was some circumstances.

09:24.200 --> 09:28.540
 And he asked the mom how old this kid was, and she's like, he's 14, and she's like,

09:28.540 --> 09:29.540
 no, he's 12.

09:29.540 --> 09:30.540
 And she's like, no, he's 14.

09:30.540 --> 09:32.060
 She goes, he's 12.

09:32.060 --> 09:36.540
 And she realized what this Nazi was telling her even in that circumstance, and it ended

09:36.540 --> 09:37.840
 up saving the kid's life.

09:37.840 --> 09:47.820
 So I think heroism in this context is defiance and standing true to values of liberalism,

09:47.820 --> 09:51.640
 humanism and venerating the sanctity of human life.

09:51.640 --> 09:56.940
 I think that, and I think it's also important to pick your battles.

09:56.940 --> 10:02.740
 I don't think if, you know, he got, that Nazi over there got in a bullhorn and said, hey,

10:02.740 --> 10:06.300
 this is the rules, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, that's not going to help anyone do anything.

10:06.300 --> 10:11.080
 So I do think, you know, people a lot of times attack me for my anarchist views, like, oh,

10:11.080 --> 10:12.400
 you know, would you call the police?

10:12.400 --> 10:13.400
 Would you use the roads?

10:13.400 --> 10:15.840
 Would you pay your income taxes?

10:15.840 --> 10:19.900
 You know, I got in an argument with Tim Pool, because there was that couple, I think it

10:19.900 --> 10:24.900
 was at Missouri or Illinois when they had their guns and they were being arrested and

10:24.900 --> 10:27.780
 they basically took a plea deal and he said, you should have fought.

10:27.780 --> 10:32.320
 I go, it's a lot easier to say you should fight, but we don't know what circumstance

10:32.320 --> 10:33.360
 someone is under.

10:33.360 --> 10:40.140
 And what these totalitarian regimes did very, very well, as you know, is if you were a target

10:40.140 --> 10:43.540
 and they can't get through to you, that's fine, you have a family.

10:43.540 --> 10:49.380
 So you can sit there, Lex, and gird your jaw and you can stand up to all the torture, cool,

10:49.380 --> 10:50.760
 what are we going to do about your wife?

10:50.760 --> 10:51.760
 What about your mom?

10:51.760 --> 10:57.780
 One thing Stalin did, he made it a law that kids up to 14 and up could get the death penalty

10:57.780 --> 10:59.240
 for certain crimes.

10:59.240 --> 11:05.040
 So after that, the rule was from the NKVD, if you were interrogating someone, they would

11:05.040 --> 11:09.440
 have death warrants for the kid's child on the desk visible.

11:09.440 --> 11:14.940
 So I'm interrogating you asking you to commit to, I'm sorry, to admit to some crime that

11:14.940 --> 11:16.080
 you're not committed.

11:16.080 --> 11:19.960
 And those piece of paper, it's Svitlana, she's got a death warrant.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.080
 You're going to admit to any crime you want.

11:22.080 --> 11:26.720
 So this is something Americans, this is even the case right now in North Korea, which I

11:26.720 --> 11:29.360
 know you had Yonmi Park on, it's something I talk about a lot.

11:29.360 --> 11:33.740
 Let's talk about it instead of the hypothetical, but this is happening right now on earth.

11:33.740 --> 11:35.920
 You can look at the map on Google.

11:35.920 --> 11:39.620
 The great leader, Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea said, class enemies must be

11:39.620 --> 11:41.720
 exterminated three generations.

11:41.720 --> 11:46.540
 So North, when people talk about individualism versus collectivism, Rick Santorum from Ascender

11:46.540 --> 11:50.440
 says the family is the basic unit of society, unit.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.080
 North Korea takes that seriously.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.400
 The family is punished as a unit.

11:54.400 --> 11:58.540
 So if someone does something wrong, three generations have to pay the price and you

11:58.540 --> 12:01.880
 often don't know who it is that got you all in trouble.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.160
 There's not a trial.

12:03.160 --> 12:07.020
 This to Western minds is something almost incomprehensible.

12:07.020 --> 12:10.640
 It's a lot easier to be brave when it's just your skin.

12:10.640 --> 12:17.920
 It's something when it's your child, your loved ones, every man becomes a coward.

12:17.920 --> 12:21.960
 But also what bravery is there for me to write an essay for The Guardian to say, I don't

12:21.960 --> 12:22.960
 vote.

12:22.960 --> 12:23.960
 There's no consequences to me.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.620
 There's no possibility of consequences to me.

12:25.620 --> 12:29.120
 This is the wonderful thing about living in a free country.

12:29.120 --> 12:35.120
 It would take a lot of courage to be in the Soviet Union and say, I'm not going to vote.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.480
 And what would that courage accomplish?

12:37.480 --> 12:38.480
 Very little.

12:38.480 --> 12:43.400
 Heroism in the sense of kind of the suicidal stuff and taking a stance with no consequences

12:43.400 --> 12:45.560
 is a bit overrated.

12:45.560 --> 12:50.680
 There is some aspect, like the way I think about heroism is something like you said about

12:50.680 --> 12:58.800
 the Nazi soldier, which is quietly privately in your own life, live the virtues that you

12:58.800 --> 13:01.160
 want the rest of the world to live by.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.160
 Yes.

13:02.160 --> 13:08.000
 So like without writing about it is not as heroic as living it quietly.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.840
 I'll give you a great example of this.

13:10.840 --> 13:17.180
 I sometimes give talks on networking and I tell the kids, if you know someone's in town

13:17.180 --> 13:19.600
 and it's their birthday with nothing to do, take them out.

13:19.600 --> 13:24.160
 And I say, I do this for selfish reasons and everyone laughs and I go, think about it this

13:24.160 --> 13:25.160
 way.

13:25.160 --> 13:29.180
 The guy who takes people out for their birthday is awesome.

13:29.180 --> 13:30.280
 That could be you.

13:30.280 --> 13:34.820
 Like you have that capacity to be that person and you're making that day feel special.

13:34.820 --> 13:36.480
 They're going to remember for a long time.

13:36.480 --> 13:37.480
 What's the cost?

13:37.480 --> 13:39.320
 30 bucks, 25 bucks.

13:39.320 --> 13:48.160
 So it's very disturbing to me how often people have opportunities to slightly move the needle

13:48.160 --> 13:51.900
 and make things a bit better at almost no cost.

13:51.900 --> 13:54.680
 And they just literally don't think in those terms.

13:54.680 --> 14:00.000
 And one of the things Camus talked about, he's often described as an existentialist,

14:00.000 --> 14:01.240
 which he did not like that term.

14:01.240 --> 14:06.040
 He regarded himself as an absurdist, is the idea that we're basically blank canvases.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.760
 And this isn't something that is dangerous.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.640
 This is an enormous opportunity.

14:09.640 --> 14:14.760
 And you have the ability to become the kind of man or woman that you admire and want to

14:14.760 --> 14:15.760
 be.

14:15.760 --> 14:18.840
 You don't have to be, I don't know, George Washington or one of these great heroes of

14:18.840 --> 14:19.960
 all time.

14:19.960 --> 14:26.060
 But everyone out there has the capacity to be, excuse me, to be a hero to their kids

14:26.060 --> 14:30.840
 or to be a hero to maybe some, there's nursing homes and there's old people who are lonely.

14:30.840 --> 14:35.980
 I think that you take in a dog that's on its last legs.

14:35.980 --> 14:41.060
 These are little things, Terry Shepherd does that a lot, I regarded him as a hero.

14:41.060 --> 14:43.040
 These are not Terry Shepherd, I'm blanking his name.

14:43.040 --> 14:48.600
 These are things that people do that aren't heroic in the sense of Superman, but that

14:48.600 --> 14:53.280
 I find admirable extremely and I think are very underrated because these people aren't

14:53.280 --> 14:54.720
 championed.

14:54.720 --> 15:00.800
 Is this some kind of weird, passive, aggressive and direct way for you to tell me that I should

15:00.800 --> 15:03.120
 take you off for your birthday on Monday?

15:03.120 --> 15:05.320
 Is that why you gave that whole speech?

15:05.320 --> 15:06.320
 That wasn't it at all.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.320
 That was a joke, Michael.

15:07.320 --> 15:09.320
 No, it was a failed joke.

15:09.320 --> 15:10.320
 Nevertheless.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.840
 There was no punchline.

15:12.840 --> 15:15.000
 Without failure, we would not have triumph.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.920
 Can we stick on the Camus absurdism versus existentialism?

15:19.920 --> 15:20.920
 Sure.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.360
 What do you think is the difference?

15:24.360 --> 15:33.120
 In your ideas about anarchism too, it seems like those are somehow intricately connected

15:33.120 --> 15:40.320
 because existentialism is connected to freedom and freedom is connected to anarchism.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.320
 Sure.

15:41.320 --> 15:46.200
 But I mean, Sartre was a defender of the Soviet Union.

15:46.200 --> 15:50.340
 He said explicitly about things like gulags, like even if it's true, we shouldn't talk

15:50.340 --> 15:53.420
 about it.

15:53.420 --> 15:57.920
 What people don't appreciate is how human beings can have contradictory ideas in their

15:57.920 --> 15:59.560
 minds at the same time.

15:59.560 --> 16:04.320
 One would think, okay, someone's a Democrat, they think ABC, therefore they think DEF.

16:04.320 --> 16:08.200
 People would have all sorts of contradictions and it's not at all clear and they'll have

16:08.200 --> 16:12.240
 a clean conscience because the human mind is very sophisticated and is capable of doing

16:12.240 --> 16:13.240
 this.

16:13.240 --> 16:19.060
 So Sartre, you would think he's this radical individualist, this sense of ultimate freedom,

16:19.060 --> 16:20.720
 but he's defending the Soviet Union.

16:20.720 --> 16:25.600
 Camus, on the other hand, would probably be, was very much like a social Democrat.

16:25.600 --> 16:29.920
 He didn't really talk about what politics should be so much as it shouldn't be.

16:29.920 --> 16:35.220
 His essay, Reflections on the Guillotine, is one of the great masterpieces of all time,

16:35.220 --> 16:41.680
 an attack on the death penalty, not in terms of no one's evil or it's wrong to kill murderers,

16:41.680 --> 16:44.640
 but in terms of what does it do for a society?

16:44.640 --> 16:51.040
 If you have someone who takes a person and locks them in a room and says, in two years,

16:51.040 --> 16:53.360
 I'm going to murder you and you lock them for that.

16:53.360 --> 16:57.960
 This is not someone we regard as moral, we regard this as someone who's a complete monster,

16:57.960 --> 17:01.480
 but that's what the state does with the death penalty.

17:01.480 --> 17:07.440
 And he challenges us to think, is this the kind of people we want to be?

17:07.440 --> 17:11.060
 And again, he's saying, I'm not saying killing a murderer is wrong.

17:11.060 --> 17:12.640
 I'm not saying evil is wrong.

17:12.640 --> 17:17.120
 His entire career was dedicated to fighting the concept of evil.

17:17.120 --> 17:22.600
 But are we the kind of people who want to be doing these things that in any other context

17:22.600 --> 17:25.000
 we regard as torture or depraved?

17:25.000 --> 17:28.800
 So I'm much more of a Camus person than a Sartre person.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.000
 So he was probably against war in that same way.

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
 So I don't, I have to admit, I don't know much about the political side of Camus.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.820
 Well, and I don't think his political side is that interesting or relevant.

17:38.820 --> 17:42.760
 What I find, sorry to interrupt you, what I find fascinating about Camus and what I

17:42.760 --> 17:48.760
 think about on a daily basis from him is his insistence that you have to live a life based

17:48.760 --> 17:53.000
 on conscience, that you have to be accountable to yourself when you put your head on the

17:53.000 --> 17:59.080
 pelt at the end of the day and ask yourself, did I live a righteous life with integrity

17:59.080 --> 18:00.840
 true to my values?

18:00.840 --> 18:06.320
 Did I not needlessly cause harm to innocent people?

18:06.320 --> 18:11.160
 That kind of mindset, did I, if someone is weak, am I using that as an opportunity to

18:11.160 --> 18:13.020
 exploit them or to harm them?

18:13.020 --> 18:17.880
 Or do I feel a bit of sympathy or empathy for this person because maybe they didn't

18:17.880 --> 18:23.040
 have circumstances that were as beneficial as other people had.

18:23.040 --> 18:29.720
 Well, how does that fit absurdism where everything is absurd, nothing has meaning, it really

18:29.720 --> 18:31.520
 borders on nihilism.

18:31.520 --> 18:39.960
 So he regards, his philosophy explicitly said is a response to nihilism and a attack on

18:39.960 --> 18:41.320
 nihilism.

18:41.320 --> 18:46.140
 He regards cynicism as the worst value people can have.

18:46.140 --> 18:48.160
 And I agree with him 100%.

18:48.160 --> 18:53.360
 A lot of times people call me cynical online and I push back very, very hard because to

18:53.360 --> 18:57.240
 be a, you know, I had this quote in the new write where I said, I'd rather be naive than

18:57.240 --> 19:01.840
 a cynic because a cynic is a hopeless man who projects his hopelessness to the world

19:01.840 --> 19:03.400
 at large.

19:03.400 --> 19:07.520
 Camus, this is the metaphor I use and I find it very inspirational.

19:07.520 --> 19:11.200
 I thought it was in his work, but I guess I thought if it described it to him.

19:11.200 --> 19:17.840
 There's two types of people, you imagine you go to a mountainside and you see a blank canvas

19:17.840 --> 19:21.160
 on an easel standing in front of this mountainside.

19:21.160 --> 19:25.880
 One people be like, why is this blank canvas here, you know, what was this, what's going

19:25.880 --> 19:26.880
 on here?

19:26.880 --> 19:28.260
 And just be confused.

19:28.260 --> 19:33.040
 Whereas the other type of person will be like, there's a blank canvas here in this beautiful

19:33.040 --> 19:35.640
 countryside, what a great opportunity.

19:35.640 --> 19:40.360
 I can paint this river, I could paint that bird, I could paint my friends or myself in

19:40.360 --> 19:42.920
 the background, infinite choices.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.240
 And this is a gift that I have been given.

19:45.240 --> 19:49.140
 And I think that also ties very heavily into what I was, I went to yeshiva as a kid, which

19:49.140 --> 19:50.380
 is Jewish school.

19:50.380 --> 19:56.840
 What we were taught incessantly how to look at life is this beautiful gift that God has

19:56.840 --> 19:59.960
 given you and that God wants you to be happy.

19:59.960 --> 20:03.400
 He wants you to live to the fullest in a moral way.

20:03.400 --> 20:08.160
 I remember the first time I went into a church and they were asking questions about the Jewish

20:08.160 --> 20:09.200
 concept, the afterlife.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.000
 They weren't familiar with Jewish thought.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.200
 And it took me a second because I didn't really have answers.

20:13.200 --> 20:18.300
 And then I remembered what we were taught, which is, let's suppose you're at this banquet,

20:18.300 --> 20:22.340
 the best chef on earth, and the table is so heavy because you've got steaks and you've

20:22.340 --> 20:29.120
 got chicken and you've got sushi and the wine's flowing and you've got your Dr. Pepper and

20:29.120 --> 20:31.780
 Mr. Pibb and the store brand, everything you want.

20:31.780 --> 20:34.860
 And you're looking around at this amazing bounty, right?

20:34.860 --> 20:39.000
 And then you turn to this best chef on earth and you're like, oh, so what's for dessert?

20:39.000 --> 20:44.400
 I mean, the offensiveness of that is just so insane.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.800
 You have this, eat the meal.

20:45.800 --> 20:50.140
 I promise you, if I could deliver this meal, the dessert's going to be okay.

20:50.140 --> 20:56.760
 So this focus on the afterlife when we've been given this amazing gift on this earth

20:56.760 --> 21:01.640
 is a very kind of different mindset from both the Jewish tradition as I'd been taught and

21:01.640 --> 21:02.640
 the Camus mindset.

21:02.640 --> 21:05.440
 Obviously, Camus was an atheist, didn't believe in an afterlife.

21:05.440 --> 21:13.720
 This concept that life is meaningless, but that means you have that opportunity to find

21:13.720 --> 21:17.540
 value, to seek for truth, to seek for happiness.

21:17.540 --> 21:20.080
 And Camus has this quote, it's ascribed to him, it's like a meme.

21:20.080 --> 21:24.080
 I've never found the source, so maybe he doesn't really say it, but he says, maybe it's not

21:24.080 --> 21:26.740
 about happy endings, maybe it's about the journey.

21:26.740 --> 21:30.240
 And I think when you have that mindset, and as you and I, I think you and I both found

21:30.240 --> 21:34.640
 this because neither of us, when we were kids, thought we'd be doing this, right?

21:34.640 --> 21:37.320
 But now that we are really fortunate.

21:37.320 --> 21:38.320
 Definitely this.

21:38.320 --> 21:39.320
 Yeah.

21:39.320 --> 21:40.320
 And definitely that.

21:40.320 --> 21:41.320
 Yeah.

21:41.320 --> 21:43.160
 But now that we're fortunate enough to do this, and that we're blessed enough that there's

21:43.160 --> 21:47.240
 people who find this of value and interest, and we could pay the rent doing this, there's

21:47.240 --> 21:53.320
 not a day that goes by where I don't think you and I think, this is pretty absurd, but

21:53.320 --> 21:54.780
 it's also pretty wonderful.

21:54.780 --> 22:00.640
 And as a consequence of us thriving, it also shows other people that happiness is possible

22:00.640 --> 22:01.920
 on this earth.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.080
 And I think cynicism is the lie.

22:05.080 --> 22:10.120
 It's not just the worldview, it's a lie that happiness is not possible on this earth.

22:10.120 --> 22:16.240
 Or it's only possible if you sell your soul and you're a bad person, you screw other people

22:16.240 --> 22:17.240
 over.

22:17.240 --> 22:20.200
 I reject that in every aspect.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.880
 As you said, my birthday is coming up.

22:21.880 --> 22:27.300
 I've been feeling just a lot of really great things have been happening very, very recently.

22:27.300 --> 22:33.200
 So it affects me very heavily emotionally, especially when I see the response it gives

22:33.200 --> 22:36.120
 to the kids.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.800
 So it's one thing to say, this is what I'm for.

22:38.800 --> 22:43.760
 But when you can provide proof of concept that what you've been advocating does result

22:43.760 --> 22:45.160
 in positive responses.

22:45.160 --> 22:50.300
 I got a message from this kid who had tried to kill himself a year ago.

22:50.300 --> 22:54.000
 And then he was like, look, I found your work, I found some other stuff.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.560
 And now I realized I'm going to make something of myself.

22:56.560 --> 23:02.240
 I was born in a meth house, you know, whatever, 19, 20 years old, I should be in the garbage.

23:02.240 --> 23:06.600
 But I'm going to try to be a stand up because I have opportunity on this earth.

23:06.600 --> 23:11.600
 Even if he fails as a stand up, you know, he's still such whatever he does, washing

23:11.600 --> 23:13.640
 dishes, there's no shame in that.

23:13.640 --> 23:18.380
 Is it so bad to have a crappy job and a girlfriend who you don't really like?

23:18.380 --> 23:20.960
 But as compared to the alternative of like, I'm going to kill myself.

23:20.960 --> 23:21.960
 This is heaven.

23:21.960 --> 23:27.600
 Well, I think there's beauty to be discovered in all of it and all of those experiences.

23:27.600 --> 23:28.600
 Yes.

23:28.600 --> 23:34.920
 So, but at the same time, so I often think about I just recently reread The Idiot by

23:34.920 --> 23:35.920
 Dostoevsky.

23:35.920 --> 23:38.120
 I often feel like the idiot.

23:38.120 --> 23:43.280
 That's why when I say I'm an idiot, I often think about Prince Mishkin, that kind of idiot,

23:43.280 --> 23:45.200
 which the world sees you as naive.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.200
 I don't think he's naive.

23:46.200 --> 23:53.800
 I don't think I'm naive, but I tend to see the good in people and the good in every moment.

23:53.800 --> 23:57.440
 And the world often is cynical.

23:57.440 --> 24:04.320
 And in fact, especially in what we do, often the intellectual is supposed to be cynical.

24:04.320 --> 24:11.000
 This is very much an urban, elite, educated mindset, where if you write a book about someone

24:11.000 --> 24:15.600
 who's, let's suppose, a drug addict or a prostitute, that has heft and that's valid.

24:15.600 --> 24:19.120
 But if you're writing a book about like a love story, you know, two people fall in love

24:19.120 --> 24:22.960
 and they're in roller coasters or carousels, that's less legitimate.

24:22.960 --> 24:23.960
 I hate that.

24:23.960 --> 24:24.960
 I hate that.

24:24.960 --> 24:29.840
 I hate that so much because the message it gives to people is you have to choose between

24:29.840 --> 24:34.400
 thriving and happiness and silliness and seriousness and depravity.

24:34.400 --> 24:38.200
 And I'm not saying a drug addict or prostitute is depraved, but they're basically their worldviews.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.960
 Unless it's dark and twisted, it doesn't really count as art.

24:40.960 --> 24:43.960
 And I despise that mindset, that subtext.

24:43.960 --> 24:47.440
 So the internet and people around me often will call me naive.

24:47.440 --> 24:48.440
 Because I don't know.

24:48.440 --> 24:49.440
 I think the word they want is innocent.

24:49.440 --> 24:50.440
 Don't you think?

24:50.440 --> 24:51.440
 It's a better word.

24:51.440 --> 24:52.440
 But it's not that innocent.

24:52.440 --> 24:56.800
 No, but innocent in that you genuinely in your heart, I know you fairly well at this

24:56.800 --> 25:02.440
 point, believe that goodness is possible and that people can, if not be good, at least

25:02.440 --> 25:04.040
 be better than they were yesterday.

25:04.040 --> 25:09.880
 See, even the word naive or the word innocent presumes that there's not wisdom in that.

25:09.880 --> 25:16.200
 Presumes that somehow that's, oh, isn't that beautiful to live that life of a child who

25:16.200 --> 25:21.280
 sees the world with these bright eyes and is hopeful about the future, but just wait

25:21.280 --> 25:26.080
 until they grow up and realize that reality is much harsher than they think.

25:26.080 --> 25:31.360
 But that child might be wiser than all of the adults in the room.

25:31.360 --> 25:36.200
 And don't you want to be, if the world is like that, don't you want to be the guy who

25:36.200 --> 25:39.120
 takes it on and changes it for the better?

25:39.120 --> 25:42.360
 So it's like saying, well, you know, cancer is everywhere.

25:42.360 --> 25:43.360
 It's inevitable.

25:43.360 --> 25:45.920
 Well, don't you want to be the one who says, not anymore.

25:45.920 --> 25:51.280
 I'm here and I'm going to make that change and I can see it being better than it is now.

25:51.280 --> 25:58.200
 So I think you and I have the same analysis of your worldview and I don't think that there

25:58.200 --> 25:59.900
 is a good word for it.

25:59.900 --> 26:05.480
 So I guess it's this idea of inherent benevolence might be wordy, but I think that's more accurate

26:05.480 --> 26:11.260
 because, you know, you and I did not have such easy lives growing up, to put it mildly.

26:11.260 --> 26:15.960
 You constantly talk about just horrific aspects of life.

26:15.960 --> 26:20.040
 So to claim that you kind of don't know that they exist or you sleep under the rug is completely

26:20.040 --> 26:25.120
 not accurate to your work and your mindset.

26:25.120 --> 26:30.320
 Can we talk about World War II and the Soviet Union?

26:30.320 --> 26:31.720
 Sure.

26:31.720 --> 26:41.140
 So on Sunday, June 22nd, 1941, Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa, which was the surprise

26:41.140 --> 26:43.960
 invasion of the Soviet Union.

26:43.960 --> 26:49.920
 If I could read to you a few lyrics from a song that for some reason is stuck throughout

26:49.920 --> 26:50.920
 my childhood.

26:50.920 --> 26:54.240
 It was a famous song during that time.

26:54.240 --> 27:02.000
 Двадцать второго июня ровно в четыре часа Киев бомбили, нам объявили, что

27:02.000 --> 27:09.640
 началась война, война началась на рассвете, чтобы больше народу убить, спали родители,

27:09.640 --> 27:14.120
 спали их дети, когда стали Киев бомбить.

27:14.120 --> 27:21.280
 The song talks about Kiev, like that moment as part of that operation that Kiev was first

27:21.280 --> 27:24.520
 bombed and it was announced on June 22nd.

27:24.520 --> 27:28.880
 The song says at exactly four o clock that the war has begun.

27:28.880 --> 27:39.760
 For some reason this song haunts me because the exactness of that time and this realization

27:39.760 --> 27:46.360
 that at any moment you can have this thing happen to you in your own personal life.

27:46.360 --> 27:52.840
 Maybe we had something like 9 11 happen where everything changes and it's just like haunting

27:52.840 --> 27:57.960
 because it makes me think that at any moment something like that could happen that changes

27:57.960 --> 28:05.800
 everything and I just think about like normal life going on in Kiev at the time and then

28:05.800 --> 28:10.880
 all of a sudden the bombs are dropping and they announce that the war has begun and you

28:10.880 --> 28:23.000
 thought you were going to stay out of the war.

28:23.000 --> 28:28.720
 This is something that is very intensely emotional for me because you and I are both Russian

28:28.720 --> 28:37.940
 Jewish so to know that my grandparents and my great grandma were told that the Nazis

28:37.940 --> 28:45.160
 are coming and this wasn't a dress rehearsal and that if they get here, which they do,

28:45.160 --> 28:50.680
 they did, Lvov is very western Ukraine, that 100% you and all your relatives are going

28:50.680 --> 28:56.600
 to be murdered.

28:56.600 --> 29:02.920
 There's a monument now in Lvov where I'm from about this but I don't think either of us

29:02.920 --> 29:13.720
 can imagine what it's like to think that we're about minutes or whatever hours or there's

29:13.720 --> 29:20.600
 just the Russian army standing between us and everyone we are related to are going to

29:20.600 --> 29:29.560
 be murdered for no reason and what's the closure here?

29:29.560 --> 29:35.720
 They evacuated a lot of people but they didn't evacuate enough and to know that there is

29:35.720 --> 29:45.920
 this force coming to 100% murder you, this isn't some kind of the TV news being hyperbolic,

29:45.920 --> 29:52.280
 they're coming to kill you and if they get you, they will kill you.

29:52.280 --> 29:57.960
 We all think about war like, oh, we hope America wins in Iraq, but if America got their ass

29:57.960 --> 30:03.640
 get kind of in Vietnam, it's not really going to affect America in the sense that you're

30:03.640 --> 30:06.560
 going to have the body bags and all the kids being killed and that's something that I'm

30:06.560 --> 30:11.360
 not super in the rug, but no one in America thought the Vietnamese are going to come here

30:11.360 --> 30:12.360
 and kill them, right?

30:12.360 --> 30:13.960
 They were secure in their person.

30:13.960 --> 30:23.800
 So to have that sense of we really need to win because if we don't win, we are 100% if

30:23.800 --> 30:30.280
 we, they, the Russian army doesn't win, we are 100% all going to be slaughtered and often

30:30.280 --> 30:36.460
 in not just a bullet to the head and in sadistic ways is something that to know that people

30:36.460 --> 30:45.480
 who share my blood saw and went through is very hard for me to kind of wrap my head around.

30:45.480 --> 30:48.600
 And there's no possibility to delude yourself.

30:48.600 --> 30:49.960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:49.960 --> 30:55.040
 Because I mean, they, they would, as the song also talks about, but that they would burn

30:55.040 --> 30:56.640
 the factories.

30:56.640 --> 31:00.120
 So it's basically saying we're in the war now.

31:00.120 --> 31:02.480
 This is like, this is your life.

31:02.480 --> 31:03.480
 Yeah.

31:03.480 --> 31:04.480
 Like this is our life now.

31:04.480 --> 31:07.560
 You know how you, yesterday you worried about like, oh, I misplaced my pen.

31:07.560 --> 31:08.560
 Where is it?

31:08.560 --> 31:11.760
 Like, it's like, yeah, this was paradise.

31:11.760 --> 31:17.680
 Most of us are going to just, our life now is that most of us are going to die.

31:17.680 --> 31:23.840
 And if we want to prevent all of us from dying, we, we have to fight.

31:23.840 --> 31:30.040
 And we also can't sit down in some kind of weird, like, desert island or, you know, plane

31:30.040 --> 31:33.880
 crash situation and be like, let's decide between us who's going to be the first to

31:33.880 --> 31:34.880
 die.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.880
 Maybe the like Titanic, the Titanic, right?

31:36.880 --> 31:40.020
 They sat down and there were like women and children in the lifeboats.

31:40.020 --> 31:41.800
 You know, they had this rational agreement.

31:41.800 --> 31:44.560
 You don't have those choices in a war.

31:44.560 --> 31:52.280
 So it's, it's something that I, it's, it's just very chilling and it's something I don't

31:52.280 --> 31:58.400
 really have the emotional space to understand or grapple with.

31:58.400 --> 32:04.440
 Even, you know, obviously I've been to North Korea, you can see it and so on and so forth.

32:04.440 --> 32:10.100
 You and I can't, or anyone listening to this, except for maybe on me and people like that,

32:10.100 --> 32:13.080
 you can't imagine what that's like to live it.

32:13.080 --> 32:18.400
 We can't, I, we can't imagine what it's like to live in those situations where it's not

32:18.400 --> 32:23.200
 like before Hitler came, everyone's, you know, dancing around and having a great time.

32:23.200 --> 32:29.360
 I mean, imagine how, what that life is like where your preference to Hitler is starving

32:29.360 --> 32:33.640
 and waiting on line for hours for bread and to have the secret police and your friend's

32:33.640 --> 32:36.600
 attorney went and your phones are all tapped and you're a prisoner.

32:36.600 --> 32:40.520
 But to you, this is infinitely better than the alternative.

32:40.520 --> 32:45.200
 Like these are the choices that, you know, our family had to deal with.

32:45.200 --> 32:50.440
 It's something that no matter how much you, it's like a, let me put it in terms of people

32:50.440 --> 32:51.440
 can understand, you know what I mean?

32:51.440 --> 32:53.720
 It's like your first bad breakup, right?

32:53.720 --> 32:57.920
 Like that's a much simpler thing to wrap your head around because it's like, if you've never

32:57.920 --> 33:02.160
 had it, you can't really, but when you feel it, it's just so intense, but you can't tell

33:02.160 --> 33:07.400
 someone what's like, we could sit down for days and hours and have people tell us, but

33:07.400 --> 33:13.440
 until it's the totality of your environment and your life and your mindset, I remember

33:13.440 --> 33:30.240
 my grandma, she would talk about it like, when you're that hungry, all you're thinking

33:30.240 --> 33:36.440
 about is bread because your brain won't like, you know, human beings, you know, we're evolved,

33:36.440 --> 33:42.720
 we have instincts, whatever, and the mind is telling you food, food, food, food, food,

33:42.720 --> 33:48.960
 and that there's kids thinking this and that they're not going to get the food.

33:48.960 --> 33:54.320
 And imagine being a parent and you're watching your kids without food and knowing they're

33:54.320 --> 33:56.600
 not going to get the food.

33:56.600 --> 34:04.960
 And the fact that this happened in North Korea in the nineties, I met a refugee and he had

34:04.960 --> 34:07.560
 to watch his dad starve to death.

34:07.560 --> 34:11.320
 And thank you.

34:11.320 --> 34:19.520
 And we have no concept of what it's like.

34:19.520 --> 34:25.480
 I mean, we kind of, you know, it's just like last night here in Austin, all the places

34:25.480 --> 34:28.640
 were closed and I couldn't get my protein powder.

34:28.640 --> 34:34.580
 And this is the extent of my suffering when it comes to food, you know, or if I couldn't,

34:34.580 --> 34:40.240
 there was a restaurant that I went to in Brooklyn where for some faqaqta reason, they weren't

34:40.240 --> 34:44.760
 serving sashimi, they only had sushi, so I had to have the rice and the carbs.

34:44.760 --> 34:51.160
 To live a life where that is the extent of your food problems as opposed to the choice

34:51.160 --> 34:55.240
 is either Hitler killing you or being hungry 24 seven.

34:55.240 --> 35:00.200
 You know, my grandma told this story of how they had a close call, it was her and her

35:00.200 --> 35:05.040
 brother and her mom, my great grandma who passed, and I think there was like either

35:05.040 --> 35:11.680
 helicopter overhead or something, and my great grandma jumped on top of my grandma's brother

35:11.680 --> 35:12.680
 and not my grandma.

35:12.680 --> 35:18.920
 So she basically did a Sophie's Choice, my grandma's name is Sophia, and chose the brother.

35:18.920 --> 35:23.280
 And this is something that she felt, you know, all her life that her mom had chosen her brother

35:23.280 --> 35:24.480
 over her.

35:24.480 --> 35:29.720
 But these little things that happen, these little kind of decisions we have to make in

35:29.720 --> 35:30.720
 life.

35:30.720 --> 35:37.080
 Or there's a book I read called Five Chimneys, I think, this woman who was an Auschwitz survivor.

35:37.080 --> 35:42.640
 And what she talked about what people don't appreciate, it's not necessarily the slaughter

35:42.640 --> 35:46.200
 and the torture, it's that there's no rhyme or reason to it.

35:46.200 --> 35:51.560
 Like she talked about how they had a camp just for people from Czechoslovakia, and they

35:51.560 --> 35:55.680
 were treated better than the Jews, and then one day they just killed them all, right?

35:55.680 --> 36:00.320
 And she's like, I still don't understand why they're giving them food and treating them

36:00.320 --> 36:04.960
 well, and then the next day they're all killed, and we will never get answers, you know.

36:04.960 --> 36:12.440
 And things like she talks about how they decided to kill all the kids, and they didn't really

36:12.440 --> 36:16.480
 either for some reason they didn't have the courage to or they wanted to be cruel, so

36:16.480 --> 36:20.200
 instead of shooting them, they just kept walking them in the snow until they all died.

36:20.200 --> 36:26.280
 So it's things like this, that the fact that you and I dodged these bullets, and that we

36:26.280 --> 36:33.120
 can be here and be doing this and, you know, running our mouths for a living, I think about

36:33.120 --> 36:43.320
 it all the time, and it's just very disturbing to know, and I know you know this as well,

36:43.320 --> 36:46.960
 that there's lots of places on earth where if people had a choice, they would kill us

36:46.960 --> 36:49.200
 on sight and be proud of themselves for it.

36:49.200 --> 36:54.760
 Yeah, there, I don't know what to make of the contrast, you were talking about the fact

36:54.760 --> 37:00.920
 that you've been truly happy the last few weeks and months, there's been a lot of moments

37:00.920 --> 37:08.000
 of happiness and joy, and that joy is built on a history of human suffering.

37:08.000 --> 37:13.260
 Like in your roots, in your blood, is a lot of people that were tortured that suffered,

37:13.260 --> 37:18.160
 so that you could have this joy, and you have both the, you have the responsibility to truly

37:18.160 --> 37:20.020
 be grateful for that joy.

37:20.020 --> 37:24.080
 But it also shows that there's the happy ending, that it does end, and a good note that it

37:24.080 --> 37:27.880
 does get infinitely, infinitely better.

37:27.880 --> 37:34.520
 And that I think there's a, I don't like using the word responsibility, but there is an opportunity

37:34.520 --> 37:41.160
 for those of us who did dodge that bullet, to give testimony to these people.

37:41.160 --> 37:46.340
 And more importantly, to give testimony to the people who are going through this now.

37:46.340 --> 37:51.780
 So one of the reasons I talk about North Korea so much, why I wrote Dear Reader, is because

37:51.780 --> 37:57.160
 it's very easy, and this is human nature, I'm not condemning people, I think that's

37:57.160 --> 37:58.620
 just how people are wired.

37:58.620 --> 38:04.360
 When you see an Asian country with Asian people, and things are bad over there, I think in

38:04.360 --> 38:08.600
 the West it's like, oh, Asia, they're all crazy, they're wacky, they eat dogs or so

38:08.600 --> 38:12.900
 on and so forth, some weird stereotype, and they think of them as kind of Martians.

38:12.900 --> 38:18.840
 So it's important for people who aren't of that kind of ancestry to kind of speak on

38:18.840 --> 38:22.740
 behalf of these people, because it's very different how just people just naturally react

38:22.740 --> 38:25.480
 when you have a Westerner talking about this.

38:25.480 --> 38:31.080
 Instead of it becoming them over there, it becomes, you know, this could have been us

38:31.080 --> 38:32.080
 very easily.

38:32.080 --> 38:36.520
 I have a friend, Peter Vahansky, great dude, and I was showing him photos when I was in

38:36.520 --> 38:40.320
 Pyongyang, and he goes, this looks like a Russian city with Asian people.

38:40.320 --> 38:42.640
 It completely disturbed him.

38:42.640 --> 38:46.560
 So that was one of the reasons I did go to North Korea, because that was as close as

38:46.560 --> 38:50.800
 I would get to see what your family went through, to see what my family went through, and they're

38:50.800 --> 38:54.680
 still living under this regime.

38:54.680 --> 38:58.600
 And one of the things I fought very hard to do with Dear Reader, which I was successful

38:58.600 --> 39:02.920
 in amazingly, and I said, I could die now.

39:02.920 --> 39:08.100
 I feel like if you just move the needle a little bit, then you've kind of paid your

39:08.100 --> 39:14.560
 due for your time here on this earth, to have it change from being a laughing stock.

39:14.560 --> 39:17.200
 And I think Team America did a good job.

39:17.200 --> 39:22.240
 They made Kim Jong Il into a clown and they made a joke of it, but you're going from nothing

39:22.240 --> 39:23.240
 to joke.

39:23.240 --> 39:26.100
 So at least now people are aware of it that it exists, right?

39:26.100 --> 39:32.040
 And then I and many others took it from a joke to like, guys, this is really, really,

39:32.040 --> 39:35.560
 really bad, and none of us can even appreciate how bad it is.

39:35.560 --> 39:38.920
 And I think now there is an understanding, other than a few people who are just looking

39:38.920 --> 39:41.800
 at it through a Trump lens and wanting Trump to fail because Trump's an asshole and that's

39:41.800 --> 39:45.160
 fine, to be like these poor people.

39:45.160 --> 39:50.680
 And it's really unfortunate because there's a segment of Western culture who thinks that

39:50.680 --> 39:58.040
 correctly, often when you're complaining about or discussing the plight of another country,

39:58.040 --> 40:01.120
 that's just your prelude to war and an excuse to invade.

40:01.120 --> 40:04.360
 Like the Kurds in Syria, you know, we're talked about, if we don't in Syria tomorrow, it's

40:04.360 --> 40:06.360
 going to be another genocide, blah, blah.

40:06.360 --> 40:09.240
 I'm not saying let's invade North Korea and things like that.

40:09.240 --> 40:14.440
 All I'm saying is, you know, thank God that this isn't your life.

40:14.440 --> 40:15.960
 I bring this up all the time.

40:15.960 --> 40:22.160
 The woman who was my guide when I was there, I'm aware of what she's up to now.

40:22.160 --> 40:28.680
 She's extremely rich by North Korean standards, but she'll never be in a position to buy medicine.

40:28.680 --> 40:31.580
 She'll never be in a position to go on a vacation.

40:31.580 --> 40:36.440
 Things that you and I just, you know, whatever, she can't go on the internet.

40:36.440 --> 40:39.260
 She can't get an encyclopedia.

40:39.260 --> 40:44.000
 She can't better herself as a person other than through what the state allows and meaning

40:44.000 --> 40:47.240
 better yourself as a person in service to the state.

40:47.240 --> 40:54.520
 So I mean, it's also frustrating because there's only so much that I can do as an individual.

40:54.520 --> 40:59.240
 What's your takeaway about human nature from looking at North Korea and looking at how

40:59.240 --> 41:02.880
 the rest of the world is looking at North Korea?

41:02.880 --> 41:03.880
 This is a great question.

41:03.880 --> 41:05.400
 I think about it fairly often.

41:05.400 --> 41:08.040
 I always say human beings are animals, right?

41:08.040 --> 41:12.440
 When you say someone's an animal, it's like a slur, like he's like a beast.

41:12.440 --> 41:16.840
 Animals are capable of enormous kindness, empathy, sympathy.

41:16.840 --> 41:19.920
 You know, they look out for one another, groom one another.

41:19.920 --> 41:24.560
 There's a thing with apes where they groom each other for parasites and even if there

41:24.560 --> 41:28.620
 are no parasites, they pretend there's parasites just to have that kind of bonding.

41:28.620 --> 41:34.880
 You see infinite photos online of like cats raising puppies because the puppies, mom died,

41:34.880 --> 41:35.940
 things like this.

41:35.940 --> 41:37.360
 That's part of being an animal.

41:37.360 --> 41:42.480
 Part of being an animal is also just the most monstrous cruelty.

41:42.480 --> 41:46.320
 Killer whales, you know, there's this big PC move to not call them killer whales and

41:46.320 --> 41:47.720
 just call them orcas.

41:47.720 --> 41:53.840
 They will murder blue whale pups, calves, excuse me, and play with them and not even

41:53.840 --> 41:54.840
 eat them.

41:54.840 --> 41:58.160
 So they just murder for the sake of fun.

41:58.160 --> 42:00.740
 Even cats, you know, kill birds all the time, things like this.

42:00.740 --> 42:03.280
 So it runs the whole gamut.

42:03.280 --> 42:07.840
 And I think it's, you know, when Yaron and I were on your show, I don't think Lord of

42:07.840 --> 42:08.840
 the Flies is accurate.

42:08.840 --> 42:14.140
 I don't think Hobbs is how reality works when you're in that kind of state.

42:14.140 --> 42:21.240
 But I think we've seen countless examples of human beings, especially when human beings

42:21.240 --> 42:28.040
 have power over someone who's powerless, of allowing themselves to engage in not just

42:28.040 --> 42:31.340
 harm, but cruelty.

42:31.340 --> 42:35.560
 And that is something as Soviets, you and I are very painfully aware of.

42:35.560 --> 42:40.680
 It's not just about the oppression, which as bad enough as it is, it's that mediocre

42:40.680 --> 42:43.800
 person with that little bit of power.

42:43.800 --> 42:50.000
 And now they're standing between you and your daughter having medicine, and they love it

42:50.000 --> 42:54.340
 to make you dance, to be like, oh, you need me to get this medicine?

42:54.340 --> 42:56.160
 Make you go through hoops?

42:56.160 --> 42:59.280
 Because now they feel like for the first time in their life, they're in a position of strength

42:59.280 --> 43:00.280
 and power.

43:00.280 --> 43:05.400
 I think that is, in many ways, the more common nature of evil that what Hannah Arendt talks

43:05.400 --> 43:09.440
 about the banality of evil, then someone who's like an SS guard, you're shooting someone

43:09.440 --> 43:10.440
 in the head.

43:10.440 --> 43:14.800
 Like that, I think we could all wrap our heads around to some extent, like, okay, I'm a military.

43:14.800 --> 43:15.800
 It's not easy.

43:15.800 --> 43:18.900
 I have to execute people pulling a trigger, you could kind of have this mental disconnect

43:18.900 --> 43:20.880
 between the finger and the victim.

43:20.880 --> 43:24.280
 But like that little day to day stuff, like, are you doing the right thing on a day to

43:24.280 --> 43:29.100
 day basis that I think is far more common, and far more disturbing aspect in certain

43:29.100 --> 43:30.920
 senses of the human psyche.

43:30.920 --> 43:43.320
 Yeah, there's something especially disturbing about a weak man, given power, and just abusing

43:43.320 --> 43:44.320
 that power.

43:44.320 --> 43:49.480
 There's something about not just weak, but like, mediocre at everything it does, or less

43:49.480 --> 43:50.480
 than mediocre.

43:50.480 --> 43:55.000
 A great example of this, which I'm also talking about in the next book is Ceausescu, who was

43:55.000 --> 43:56.420
 the dictator of Romania.

43:56.420 --> 44:02.900
 So you know, the Cold War is still somewhat poorly understood in, you know, popular culture.

44:02.900 --> 44:06.980
 But the different countries in the second world, the Soviet bloc, some are more liberal

44:06.980 --> 44:08.800
 than others, some are more sane than others.

44:08.800 --> 44:13.400
 And Ceausescu, at first was one of the, you know, more Western friendly, more the free

44:13.400 --> 44:14.400
 ones.

44:14.400 --> 44:17.760
 Then he met the great leader Kim Il Sung from North Korea, and he had the idea to impose

44:17.760 --> 44:22.360
 a personality cult on Romania, and it's the kind of things like forcing people to breed

44:22.360 --> 44:24.440
 because he wanted to make people taller.

44:24.440 --> 44:28.200
 I think he made like the biggest building in all of Europe, the People's Palace, but

44:28.200 --> 44:31.900
 it was just for him, while there's no electricity, you know, elsewhere.

44:31.900 --> 44:34.680
 But you look at this guy, you know, Stalin's a badass, right?

44:34.680 --> 44:35.680
 He was a bank robber.

44:35.680 --> 44:37.920
 If you look at photos of him as a kid, he was a hunk.

44:37.920 --> 44:39.920
 Lenin was clearly intellectual.

44:39.920 --> 44:46.120
 These were powerful Trotsky, these were powerful men with huge egos, huge force of personality.

44:46.120 --> 44:52.240
 But you look at this Ceausescu guy, and you could, like for example, on my driver's license,

44:52.240 --> 44:56.640
 instead of my address, I'm not giving my real address, being like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5th Avenue,

44:56.640 --> 44:59.800
 by mistake it says 1, 2, 3, 4, 5th Street, right?

44:59.800 --> 45:04.000
 So you can imagine him being in the post office and me giving him my ID to get my package

45:04.000 --> 45:08.240
 and him being baffled because this says street, this says Avenue instead of understanding.

45:08.240 --> 45:12.620
 And this, the look on his face, this dullard, that you can see how, you know how sometimes

45:12.620 --> 45:15.160
 I'm going to, can I curse?

45:15.160 --> 45:16.160
 Fuck yes.

45:16.160 --> 45:17.160
 Yeah.

45:17.160 --> 45:18.280
 So if you know, like how if you're in the airport and you see someone and you look at

45:18.280 --> 45:21.960
 them and an adult and you think, okay, this person was born fucked up, just like on sight,

45:21.960 --> 45:22.960
 like something's wrong with them.

45:22.960 --> 45:24.060
 How are they traveling alone?

45:24.060 --> 45:28.040
 You look at Ceausescu, you look at him, you're like, something's not right with this guy.

45:28.040 --> 45:31.340
 Not in the sense of like evil, but in the sense of he's a simpleton, right?

45:31.340 --> 45:35.160
 And now he's in charge of this whole country and everyone's taught to regard him as one

45:35.160 --> 45:37.440
 of the great geniuses of all time.

45:37.440 --> 45:43.400
 And it's this, the idea, this mediocre nobody, this guy would have in any other culture been

45:43.400 --> 45:49.280
 accomplished nothing or would have had an honest job where he's like, okay, he works

45:49.280 --> 45:52.780
 at the mail service and he's bad at it, okay, fine, he's not hurting anyone.

45:52.780 --> 45:58.380
 And now as a result of this, he's responsible for mass death, secret police, and incarceration.

45:58.380 --> 46:03.440
 And you know, one of the greatest things I've ever seen, which I'm sure many people see

46:03.440 --> 46:08.480
 as well, if you go on YouTube, it's his speech, and it's the first time the crowd turns and

46:08.480 --> 46:11.880
 his head kind of like, because they start booing him, which was unheard of.

46:11.880 --> 46:16.700
 And he was shot with his dog faced wife not that long after, it was just a great moment.

46:16.700 --> 46:22.220
 But it's things like this, I agree with you, that mediocre, weak person is now in a position

46:22.220 --> 46:24.120
 of power over somebody else.

46:24.120 --> 46:29.160
 And that sense of vindictiveness, like I'm going to feel strong for once in my life,

46:29.160 --> 46:31.000
 but it's going to be at your expense.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.640
 That I think is, you know, human nature, it's most primal.

46:34.640 --> 46:39.040
 And every time I meet a person in this world, you're the first person to get me to cry on

46:39.040 --> 46:40.040
 a fucking podcast.

46:40.040 --> 46:41.840
 Fucking the robot gets me to cry.

46:41.840 --> 46:43.400
 What the fuck is going on?

46:43.400 --> 46:52.240
 Every time I meet a weird person, somebody, to me, heroism is also taking a risk to rebel

46:52.240 --> 46:55.640
 against mediocrity.

46:55.640 --> 47:02.240
 Like in the most simplest of ways, like the license address, like taking a risk to break

47:02.240 --> 47:07.720
 the little bit of rule that nobody will know about, to take that little bit of a leap of

47:07.720 --> 47:11.080
 like that little protest against the bureaucracy.

47:11.080 --> 47:14.400
 Like that Nazi guard where he just spoke out, he's like, hey lady.

47:14.400 --> 47:15.400
 That's a big one.

47:15.400 --> 47:16.400
 Oh, that's a big, sure.

47:16.400 --> 47:19.600
 I mean, like literally at the line at Starbucks or something like that.

47:19.600 --> 47:26.280
 Like even in the tiniest of ways, when I see people just like, it's almost like that little

47:26.280 --> 47:32.040
 like glimmer in their eye, a wink, like we're in this together, there's all this conformity

47:32.040 --> 47:33.640
 all around us.

47:33.640 --> 47:38.920
 That's at a different time could have been Nazi Germany, could have been a Stalinist

47:38.920 --> 47:39.920
 Soviet union.

47:39.920 --> 47:40.920
 Sure.

47:40.920 --> 47:41.920
 We're in this together.

47:41.920 --> 47:47.080
 We're going to rebel against that conformity by just taking the risk, that little bit of

47:47.080 --> 47:48.920
 risk against mediocrity.

47:48.920 --> 47:50.400
 I don't know.

47:50.400 --> 47:55.200
 And then once again, I see this in companies too.

47:55.200 --> 48:00.960
 When I see the mediocrity, I see this, I used to work at Google, I see it in Google and

48:00.960 --> 48:04.600
 when the companies grow, that mediocrity is overwhelming.

48:04.600 --> 48:05.780
 The Peter principle, right?

48:05.780 --> 48:06.780
 The Peter principle.

48:06.780 --> 48:07.780
 Yeah.

48:07.780 --> 48:16.120
 My hope is that all of us have the possibility for that glimmer, that risk taking, the leap

48:16.120 --> 48:21.120
 of faith, whatever the heck that is, the leap out of the ordinary, out of the conformity,

48:21.120 --> 48:22.540
 out of the mediocrity.

48:22.540 --> 48:24.860
 So this is where you and I disagree.

48:24.860 --> 48:28.960
 I think most, a lot of people are not capable of that.

48:28.960 --> 48:30.760
 They're accustomed to it.

48:30.760 --> 48:32.680
 I don't know if they're not capable.

48:32.680 --> 48:34.400
 I understand your position.

48:34.400 --> 48:35.400
 I'm disagreeing with it.

48:35.400 --> 48:36.840
 I'm saying I do not think they're capable.

48:36.840 --> 48:40.720
 I think a lot of people effectively don't have souls.

48:40.720 --> 48:45.680
 They do not have a conscience in this sense where they're going to look at an issue, bring

48:45.680 --> 48:51.720
 their critical thinking and say, all right, I am going to do the right thing, although

48:51.720 --> 48:52.720
 I'm taking a risk.

48:52.720 --> 48:56.120
 Do you think thinking is involved or is it just taking that leap?

48:56.120 --> 48:58.760
 There's something about that basic human spirit.

48:58.760 --> 49:00.720
 Forget the thinking part.

49:00.720 --> 49:06.740
 It's just saying, I'll take that risk, taking that adventure, the same thing that got people

49:06.740 --> 49:18.400
 to explore the seas throughout human civilization, explore land, explore the oceans, that exploration.

49:18.400 --> 49:21.920
 We've done stuff this way all this time.

49:21.920 --> 49:25.040
 I'm going to take a leap and that comes out of nowhere seemingly.

49:25.040 --> 49:30.760
 But those people are the heroes, but I don't think that's universal.

49:30.760 --> 49:33.420
 I'm going to use a very gauche example.

49:33.420 --> 49:37.240
 There was a show called Scare Tactics, which was basically a candid camera, but they would

49:37.240 --> 49:38.240
 scare people.

49:38.240 --> 49:45.240
 They'd have vampires, whatever, a hidden camera and people's reactions.

49:45.240 --> 49:48.920
 Sometimes the prank didn't work out like they expected.

49:48.920 --> 49:54.200
 There was one where they were hiring the people who were the marks, the contestants so to speak,

49:54.200 --> 49:56.560
 was hired to be a security guard.

49:56.560 --> 50:00.720
 You have to watch this factory overnight and you get paid.

50:00.720 --> 50:05.840
 But the setup was some people were breaking out of the factory in the middle of the night

50:05.840 --> 50:10.360
 like in rags and they were saying they were keeping us prisoner here, blah, blah, and

50:10.360 --> 50:12.600
 just watch the person reaction to this.

50:12.600 --> 50:19.000
 There was one security guard where he basically forced them back into the building and they're

50:19.000 --> 50:20.960
 working us 24 seven, we're getting beaten.

50:20.960 --> 50:24.500
 He's like, I'm here to do a job, get back in there.

50:24.500 --> 50:30.080
 You watch this and it never even enters his head to be like, something's wrong here.

50:30.080 --> 50:37.600
 He was given his orders, he's following his orders and to me, that is not uncommon and

50:37.600 --> 50:43.200
 that person, although they look like you and I, there's something essentially human missing

50:43.200 --> 50:44.200
 with them.

50:44.200 --> 50:49.920
 Now, very quickly, the reaction is, well, it's one step from there to Nazism.

50:49.920 --> 50:54.560
 I don't think it's something that, I'm not saying this person should be killed, but I'm

50:54.560 --> 51:02.640
 just saying to expect that every human being has the capacity to have that defiance, especially

51:02.640 --> 51:07.440
 at a cost to their own life, that I think is not realistic.

51:07.440 --> 51:13.680
 But at the same time, I feel like an octopus on the eighth hand, it is those few of us,

51:13.680 --> 51:20.640
 or if you want to include me in this, who do make these tiny little protests, who look

51:20.640 --> 51:25.480
 the other way when someone is hungry, who's stealing food from the supermarket, right?

51:25.480 --> 51:30.040
 It's like, all right, I'm going to pretend I didn't see anything.

51:30.040 --> 51:37.420
 Those little elements of heroism are what move humanity forward and demonstrate the

51:37.420 --> 51:42.260
 validity of the human experience, whereas everyone else is kind of like scenery.

51:42.260 --> 51:48.560
 I think almost everybody in the world can derive deep meaning and pleasure from having

51:48.560 --> 51:54.280
 done those courageous acts, and I also think they have the capacity to do them, to discover

51:54.280 --> 51:55.480
 that meaning and happiness.

51:55.480 --> 51:57.560
 So you're the cynic, then why aren't they doing it?

51:57.560 --> 52:05.340
 They haven't gotten a chance to, like I've never tried LSD or DMT, you haven't gotten

52:05.340 --> 52:09.760
 the chance to try this amazing journey, which is taking the risk.

52:09.760 --> 52:15.320
 That's nonsense, because as you just said two minutes ago, everyone has that chance

52:15.320 --> 52:17.800
 every day to do the right thing.

52:17.800 --> 52:20.760
 We have the chance to do a lot of things and we don't realize.

52:20.760 --> 52:24.960
 There's a lot of stuff right in front of our nose that we don't realize, because you have

52:24.960 --> 52:26.680
 to kind of wake up to it.

52:26.680 --> 52:33.040
 Sometimes you need the catalyst, there needs to be some kind of thing that happens that

52:33.040 --> 52:36.000
 wakes you up.

52:36.000 --> 52:42.440
 The fact that most people don't take the small acts of rebellion doesn't mean they don't

52:42.440 --> 52:49.000
 have the capacity to both do so and to derive a lot of meaning from it.

52:49.000 --> 52:55.120
 Then it's a discussion about how to create societies that get more and more people to

52:55.120 --> 52:59.280
 be free actors and free thinkers.

52:59.280 --> 53:00.720
 That's the question.

53:00.720 --> 53:04.940
 That probably leads us into a discussion of anarchism and so on, but I just think we are

53:04.940 --> 53:07.440
 very young as a species.

53:07.440 --> 53:14.440
 We're trying to figure out how to get ourselves to first be collaborative, but at the same

53:14.440 --> 53:16.480
 time be free spirits.

53:16.480 --> 53:19.440
 I think both of those are within human nature for most of us.

53:19.440 --> 53:25.880
 I think another big concern is that there's enormous disincentives, and this is Michael

53:25.880 --> 53:31.960
 Malus speaking, for human beings to be kind and for tenderness.

53:31.960 --> 53:36.400
 I think, especially when you're young, you know what I mean, when you're immature, a

53:36.400 --> 53:40.840
 lot of times someone will reach out to you with kindness or vulnerability and you think

53:40.840 --> 53:44.920
 it's funny to kind of dunk their head in the water in a pool or something like that.

53:44.920 --> 53:50.440
 When you get older, there's this one example of this.

53:50.440 --> 53:53.600
 This was in the 90s, and there was a woman.

53:53.600 --> 53:58.880
 She became a stripper or something like that or whatever it was, but she had this amazing

53:58.880 --> 53:59.880
 body.

53:59.880 --> 54:01.240
 She was just gorgeous.

54:01.240 --> 54:04.680
 The show was, she was talking about how when she was in high school, she was bullied a

54:04.680 --> 54:07.240
 lot and that there was this football player.

54:07.240 --> 54:10.160
 He messed with her every single day.

54:10.160 --> 54:13.120
 One day, she even threw pickles in her hair and her hair smelled like pickles and it was

54:13.120 --> 54:14.640
 laughing at her.

54:14.640 --> 54:17.520
 This really screwed her up, I mean, up to that show.

54:17.520 --> 54:21.280
 They took her backstage and they brought out the football player, and now he's a dad and

54:21.280 --> 54:22.280
 a regular dude.

54:22.280 --> 54:26.880
 He's like, do you know why you're here, and he's like, no, and they're like, oh, what

54:26.880 --> 54:27.880
 were you like in high school?

54:27.880 --> 54:30.200
 He's like, I was kind of a jock, bully, whatever.

54:30.200 --> 54:34.640
 They brought her out, and he didn't even remember her really, and she just starts crying about

54:34.640 --> 54:38.680
 the pickles and whatever, and this is something that affected her for 20 years, and I've never

54:38.680 --> 54:43.560
 seen a clearer example of someone who wanted to kill themselves than this guy.

54:43.560 --> 54:48.580
 The guilt on his face, and he's looking at her, and he's desperate to be like, what can

54:48.580 --> 54:54.160
 I do to take your pain away, to make it better?

54:54.160 --> 54:57.080
 He was just crippled by it because he knew there's nothing he could do.

54:57.080 --> 54:59.640
 He knew he 100% did the wrong thing.

54:59.640 --> 55:02.260
 He knew he did the wrong thing unthinkingly.

55:02.260 --> 55:08.480
 You can imagine, I got to screw over this lady to feed my family, that's fine.

55:08.480 --> 55:11.840
 At the time, it meant nothing to him, so of course he didn't remember, and he was just

55:11.840 --> 55:14.560
 paralyzed by this sense of crippling guilt.

55:14.560 --> 55:19.240
 One of the reasons I always try to do the right thing isn't because I'm an inherently

55:19.240 --> 55:23.240
 good person, which I do not think I am, I don't think anyone is inherently good, but

55:23.240 --> 55:29.020
 because I will feel guilty about it for a very, very long time because if you do the

55:29.020 --> 55:35.760
 wrong thing, this is a very Camus idea, if you do the wrong thing to a good person, that's

55:35.760 --> 55:39.120
 really, really bad because what kind of person are you?

55:39.120 --> 55:44.180
 In the same way that everyone can be that guy who takes someone out for their birthday,

55:44.180 --> 55:48.600
 everyone has that ability for someone who did the wrong thing to someone who's a normal

55:48.600 --> 55:52.080
 person and do you want to be that guy as well?

55:52.080 --> 56:00.920
 My friend, Bittstein, he's a big Bitcoin person, my biography ego in hubris is like $500 now

56:00.920 --> 56:04.480
 on eBay, it's hard to find, came out in 2006.

56:04.480 --> 56:11.100
 He had told me that you can get it on torrent, it's downloadable, and I'm like, oh, I thought

56:11.100 --> 56:13.380
 if you're my friend, you'd want to buy it.

56:13.380 --> 56:18.000
 At the time, it was not $500, I assure you, and he goes, I did buy it, I'm just telling

56:18.000 --> 56:22.600
 you that you could also get it for free, this information that you might want to use.

56:22.600 --> 56:30.840
 And I snapped at this kid who was doing right by me and I felt, it just stuck in my head,

56:30.840 --> 56:32.780
 I'm like, you're an ass.

56:32.780 --> 56:36.420
 And then years later, I apologize, he had no memory of this at all and I'm glad to be

56:36.420 --> 56:38.320
 able to reiterate the apology again.

56:38.320 --> 56:45.860
 But a lot of times I'm extremely aggressive on Twitter and in other venues, I always try

56:45.860 --> 56:51.580
 to and maybe I fail and that's my moral failing, always do it as a counter attack.

56:51.580 --> 56:55.400
 If you're going to start going personal, if you're going to start being aggressive against

56:55.400 --> 57:00.360
 an individual, I'm not going to necessarily hold back when I reciprocate.

57:00.360 --> 57:05.680
 And it's something that is very common on social media, but I don't think it is normal.

57:05.680 --> 57:09.680
 Just because a lot of this, you're talking about the quiet little rebellion, just because

57:09.680 --> 57:14.120
 everyone else around you thinks it's okay to just go up to people and attack them in

57:14.120 --> 57:19.400
 the most personal ways, impromptu because of their views, really just take a step back

57:19.400 --> 57:21.000
 and realize what you're engaging with.

57:21.000 --> 57:26.800
 Now, if that's the fight they want, then my Soviet cruelty could come out and that's kind

57:26.800 --> 57:32.200
 of why I don't drink because I do enjoy it, but at the same time, be aware of what you're

57:32.200 --> 57:33.200
 doing.

57:33.200 --> 57:39.520
 And again, this goes back to Camus's sense that conscience really is what makes us human

57:39.520 --> 57:40.520
 beings.

57:40.520 --> 57:44.440
 That's the thing I was saying, I don't think most people think in terms of conscience.

57:44.440 --> 57:51.240
 They don't think it, we are taught, this is that creeping cynicism that, oh, grow up.

57:51.240 --> 57:55.520
 When you're an adult, you have to make sacrifices, blah, blah, blah.

57:55.520 --> 58:00.080
 And even if I buy that for a second, which I don't, but if I have to make sacrifices

58:00.080 --> 58:05.680
 sometimes, that doesn't mean it's okay for me to make a sacrifice of my values in this

58:05.680 --> 58:06.680
 moment.

58:06.680 --> 58:10.800
 If I have to maybe be at work and my boss is a jerk to me and calls me names, I have

58:10.800 --> 58:13.800
 to be humiliated, but I got to put food on the plate.

58:13.800 --> 58:18.600
 That doesn't mean it's okay later if I'm at a party and I'm just extremely offensive to

58:18.600 --> 58:21.720
 someone for no reason.

58:21.720 --> 58:26.160
 My own flavor of a little bit of rebellion.

58:26.160 --> 58:28.680
 Sometimes I use the number two.

58:28.680 --> 58:45.560
 You know, you're very witty on Twitter and Twitter likes mockery and wit and a counter

58:45.560 --> 58:51.200
 attack is, Twitter loves that, somebody who's skilled at it.

58:51.200 --> 59:03.080
 My own flavor of a bit of rebellion is to say things very simply, bordering on cliche

59:03.080 --> 59:09.800
 with authenticity and like genuinely meaning the words I say, but knowing that those words

59:09.800 --> 59:13.720
 would be, are easy to attack.

59:13.720 --> 59:20.400
 And that sometimes those attacks can hurt because people would just mock me.

59:20.400 --> 59:24.800
 People don't like earnestness because they've been taught to be too cool for school.

59:24.800 --> 59:29.440
 So there's this pressure for me to be sound way more sophisticated.

59:29.440 --> 59:38.840
 Use bigger words, sometimes throw in a criticism of institutions or something like that, almost

59:38.840 --> 59:42.800
 as if I have a deep wisdom about the way the world is broken.

59:42.800 --> 59:50.040
 But when you speak very simply about beautiful things in life, it's very easy to sound like

59:50.040 --> 59:52.800
 you don't know what the hell you're talking about.

59:52.800 --> 59:55.480
 And I kind of, I stick by that.

59:55.480 --> 59:59.480
 I don't know where that's going to end up, but it's like the idiot from Dostoevsky.

59:59.480 --> 1:00:05.320
 It feels like that's the right thing, even if it hurts when I'm attacked for it.

1:00:05.320 --> 1:00:09.940
 I do something similar sometimes, which is I'll have some innocuous comment about like

1:00:09.940 --> 1:00:10.940
 bubblegum.

1:00:10.940 --> 1:00:12.960
 I mean, just it's not to be in political.

1:00:12.960 --> 1:00:18.960
 And a lot of times people will respond to this paragraph of just invective about like

1:00:18.960 --> 1:00:22.520
 blah, blah, blah, and then this, and you say this, and you're an ass, and just really trying

1:00:22.520 --> 1:00:24.280
 to get at me.

1:00:24.280 --> 1:00:29.540
 And in those situations, there are very specific circumstances, I will respond and I mean it

1:00:29.540 --> 1:00:31.040
 every single time.

1:00:31.040 --> 1:00:36.240
 I will say, I wish your parents had been kinder to you or your mom or your dad.

1:00:36.240 --> 1:00:40.840
 Because even if I'm some idiot on Twitter, who's just talking about bubblegum, and this

1:00:40.840 --> 1:00:44.200
 is your, I'm not talking about politics where I can see how people get emotional, COVID,

1:00:44.200 --> 1:00:46.600
 my grandma died, now you're talking about her.

1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:50.260
 And I realize this isn't about me.

1:00:50.260 --> 1:00:55.520
 Like I'm someone you've never met making some inane point about nothing, and you're getting

1:00:55.520 --> 1:00:57.100
 agitated about this.

1:00:57.100 --> 1:00:59.680
 It's clearly something else that's going on here.

1:00:59.680 --> 1:01:04.880
 And someone taught you, someone had to teach you that this is how to respond in this kind

1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:07.120
 of very kind of harsh way.

1:01:07.120 --> 1:01:11.340
 And a lot of times they won't say anything or get deleted.

1:01:11.340 --> 1:01:19.560
 And I hope every single time, there's no asterisk here, that they take a second, and they realize

1:01:19.560 --> 1:01:25.560
 that the way that they were talked to growing up was not acceptable, that they don't have

1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:27.680
 to carry this forward.

1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:31.040
 And that they don't have to be kind to me, I'm nobody to them.

1:01:31.040 --> 1:01:36.080
 But take a second and ask if this is the kind of mindset you want to be your norm, as opposed

1:01:36.080 --> 1:01:39.280
 to a weapon you pull out of your pocket sometimes where it's warranted or even when it's not

1:01:39.280 --> 1:01:40.280
 warranted.

1:01:40.280 --> 1:01:50.080
 I think there's a lot of those people out there, and we forget how hard it is for a

1:01:50.080 --> 1:01:55.360
 lot of people to grow up, how they're trained from their parents or the single parent, that

1:01:55.360 --> 1:01:59.640
 the only way they're going to get attention is by acting out, that when they do good things,

1:01:59.640 --> 1:02:01.080
 it doesn't get comment.

1:02:01.080 --> 1:02:04.240
 But if they do bad things, they get a smack upside their head.

1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:07.240
 That I think is far more common than we realize.

1:02:07.240 --> 1:02:12.840
 And it's not hitting the kid that's going to last, the pain is going to give five seconds.

1:02:12.840 --> 1:02:17.480
 But when you're training this child, helpless child, is something that's really, really

1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:18.480
 bad.

1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:20.440
 I don't know if it always can be mapped to that.

1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:24.800
 I always wonder about them, what their motivations are.

1:02:24.800 --> 1:02:28.920
 And I just kind of, whenever I think about them, I think only positively.

1:02:28.920 --> 1:02:31.080
 And I don't even think about the childhood thing.

1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:35.840
 I think, I don't know.

1:02:35.840 --> 1:02:42.080
 I kind of imagine that all of us can go through that stage where we enjoy the derision of

1:02:42.080 --> 1:02:43.080
 others.

1:02:43.080 --> 1:02:44.280
 We go through stages of being...

1:02:44.280 --> 1:02:48.200
 I enjoy the derision of others, but it has to be, you know, Billy Eide had that quote,

1:02:48.200 --> 1:02:51.540
 like, I like it when people are mean to me, I stop pretending to be nice.

1:02:51.540 --> 1:02:53.760
 But like, what's the worst thing someone can say about you?

1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:56.560
 You're not, what harm are you doing?

1:02:56.560 --> 1:02:59.660
 Maybe your podcast is garbage and the people are, the conversations suck and the people

1:02:59.660 --> 1:03:00.660
 are losers.

1:03:00.660 --> 1:03:01.660
 Okay.

1:03:01.660 --> 1:03:05.540
 No, the main thing I would say is I'm way more popular than I deserve to be.

1:03:05.540 --> 1:03:07.080
 What does deserve mean?

1:03:07.080 --> 1:03:17.000
 The reality is there's people out there that just enjoy hating on others and I don't fault

1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:18.000
 them for it.

1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:21.240
 Like, I don't even think of them as haters.

1:03:21.240 --> 1:03:25.000
 I think of them as just people that in this particular part of their life are enjoying

1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:32.040
 this activity of deriding others on the internet.

1:03:32.040 --> 1:03:34.240
 I'm not sure what to do with that.

1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:38.520
 I just don't want to, I don't want to allow myself to think badly of them, I guess is

1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:39.520
 the thing.

1:03:39.520 --> 1:03:41.160
 I'm the one saying don't think badly of them.

1:03:41.160 --> 1:03:43.640
 I'm saying that I don't think they're inherently bad people.

1:03:43.640 --> 1:03:48.000
 I think that their thinking is screwed and that I'm steel mounting them.

1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:51.400
 I'm saying, let's assume everything you're saying about Lex is true.

1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:53.560
 This is an opportunity for you to outdo Lex.

1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:54.560
 Like it's...

1:03:54.560 --> 1:03:59.420
 No, but are you saying they should stop hating because I'm saying like, maybe they shouldn't

1:03:59.420 --> 1:04:00.420
 just keep...

1:04:00.420 --> 1:04:01.760
 I don't believe in should, right?

1:04:01.760 --> 1:04:07.480
 I'm an anarchist, but I'm saying if this is your belief about Lex, you know what it is?

1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:11.900
 I made this comment in my book, The New Right, when people make fun of Andy Warhol and they're

1:04:11.900 --> 1:04:15.360
 like, oh my God, he painted a soup can and now he became a millionaire.

1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:16.360
 I could do this.

1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:17.960
 Well, why don't you?

1:04:17.960 --> 1:04:22.920
 So basically if I go up to you with a check and I say, I will give you a million dollars,

1:04:22.920 --> 1:04:27.260
 you could see the check, you got to paint a soup can, what am I waiting for?

1:04:27.260 --> 1:04:32.720
 So clearly there's a disconnect in their thinking between what they're perceiving and the reality.

1:04:32.720 --> 1:04:38.060
 Because if it was as simple or as, maybe not simple, but as possible for them as they perceive

1:04:38.060 --> 1:04:42.400
 it to be, why are they leaving comments instead of outdoing you?

1:04:42.400 --> 1:04:46.320
 How great would it be for them to have your bigger audience and drive you into the ground?

1:04:46.320 --> 1:04:48.280
 I don't know how that would work because it's not the NBA, but...

1:04:48.280 --> 1:04:50.600
 No, but you want to point out, you do this too on Twitter.

1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:57.880
 You want to point out the hypocrisy, the fraudulence of others, right?

1:04:57.880 --> 1:05:01.760
 Sure, but what are you, you're not claiming anything other than this is, the following

1:05:01.760 --> 1:05:06.820
 is the conversation between me and Machique, whatever his name is, right?

1:05:06.820 --> 1:05:07.980
 I got the voice down, dude.

1:05:07.980 --> 1:05:08.980
 I got it down.

1:05:08.980 --> 1:05:11.160
 I've been walking around my house doing my Lex impression.

1:05:11.160 --> 1:05:13.160
 I've been leaking motor oil everywhere.

1:05:13.160 --> 1:05:16.280
 Yeah, but yeah, I don't know.

1:05:16.280 --> 1:05:17.280
 I don't know.

1:05:17.280 --> 1:05:21.000
 I don't know what to make of it because I think there's a more general statement to

1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:22.000
 be made.

1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:23.640
 Like I see Twitter this way too.

1:05:23.640 --> 1:05:30.080
 When I read a tweet, I try to read it with like the best possible interpretation, meaning

1:05:30.080 --> 1:05:33.360
 like what is the wisdom in this tweet, right?

1:05:33.360 --> 1:05:40.040
 As opposed to what I think a large number of people, not a large number, but some fraction

1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:43.960
 try to see what is the worst possible interpretation of this tweet.

1:05:43.960 --> 1:05:49.440
 And they want to, they want to destroy you for that worst interpretation.

1:05:49.440 --> 1:05:54.480
 Like they want to, there's people, I'm already aware of this with me and certainly with a

1:05:54.480 --> 1:05:57.040
 lot of people, they're waiting for me to fail.

1:05:57.040 --> 1:06:01.160
 They want me to be like, this guy talks about love all the time.

1:06:01.160 --> 1:06:04.880
 They want me to be some dark, like a Bill Cosby type character.

1:06:04.880 --> 1:06:05.880
 They want you to be in pain.

1:06:05.880 --> 1:06:06.880
 Yeah.

1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:07.880
 They want you to be in pain because they don't.

1:06:07.880 --> 1:06:08.880
 Why?

1:06:08.880 --> 1:06:09.880
 I'll tell you exactly why.

1:06:09.880 --> 1:06:13.180
 Because this is why I'm so for being white pilled and being for hope.

1:06:13.180 --> 1:06:18.160
 Because if you are black pilled, meaning if you think it's pointless, we're all done.

1:06:18.160 --> 1:06:19.760
 You're just wasting your breath.

1:06:19.760 --> 1:06:25.060
 If you have any counter examples to this thesis, if there's even a little bit of hope, your

1:06:25.060 --> 1:06:27.200
 entire hypothesis falls through, right?

1:06:27.200 --> 1:06:32.360
 So it's kind of how like you have all these stories of people who are like painting swastikas

1:06:32.360 --> 1:06:35.800
 who aren't Nazis, but just to show that, oh, there's all this Nazism.

1:06:35.800 --> 1:06:38.840
 So I'm going to kind of force the conclusion.

1:06:38.840 --> 1:06:45.000
 So for them, when they see you thriving, you are as a mediocre person with a crappy show,

1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:47.300
 but you're demonstrating that people can succeed.

1:06:47.300 --> 1:06:48.480
 This bothers them.

1:06:48.480 --> 1:06:49.480
 So you are.

1:06:49.480 --> 1:06:51.200
 Anyone can succeed.

1:06:51.200 --> 1:06:52.200
 That bothers them.

1:06:52.200 --> 1:06:53.200
 Yeah.

1:06:53.200 --> 1:06:54.200
 So because that, why haven't they?

1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:58.040
 So now you're a counter to their worldview and that is going to cause anxiety when you

1:06:58.040 --> 1:07:01.760
 have data that contradicts other data in your, in your worldview.

1:07:01.760 --> 1:07:04.360
 This is the, in your mindset, this is a big issue for them.

1:07:04.360 --> 1:07:05.360
 Yeah.

1:07:05.360 --> 1:07:09.720
 So to anyone listening to this, they're annoyed by the look of my face.

1:07:09.720 --> 1:07:12.980
 Remember that you could probably do way better than me and you should.

1:07:12.980 --> 1:07:15.720
 But also what would you failing look like?

1:07:15.720 --> 1:07:21.240
 Like let's suppose this podcast went from whatever views you had to 100 views an episode.

1:07:21.240 --> 1:07:22.740
 That's still success.

1:07:22.740 --> 1:07:26.920
 You are talking to people you like, having conversations about important issues.

1:07:26.920 --> 1:07:28.280
 You're having a good time.

1:07:28.280 --> 1:07:29.280
 They're having a good time.

1:07:29.280 --> 1:07:30.280
 How is that a failure?

1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:35.660
 If I have dinner with a friend of mine, there's zero viewers and we enjoy that time.

1:07:35.660 --> 1:07:38.940
 That is the height of human success.

1:07:38.940 --> 1:07:43.780
 When you are sharing happiness, joy, joy over love.

1:07:43.780 --> 1:07:46.600
 So what's the difference between joy and love, Michael Malus?

1:07:46.600 --> 1:07:49.940
 Uh, I think joy is easier to attain.

1:07:49.940 --> 1:07:50.980
 It's more common.

1:07:50.980 --> 1:07:53.300
 You could share it with everyone.

1:07:53.300 --> 1:07:55.320
 Give me an example of joy.

1:07:55.320 --> 1:07:58.160
 Like what was the moment of joy for you recently?

1:07:58.160 --> 1:08:02.540
 I could give you a great example of joy and this is part in the absurdist mindset.

1:08:02.540 --> 1:08:03.540
 Okay.

1:08:03.540 --> 1:08:09.320
 I love having a bad meal at a restaurant and I'll give you, you can see why.

1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:10.980
 You go with your friend.

1:08:10.980 --> 1:08:13.260
 It takes you 45 minutes to get seated.

1:08:13.260 --> 1:08:14.260
 Okay.

1:08:14.260 --> 1:08:15.780
 I'm starving.

1:08:15.780 --> 1:08:17.420
 Waiter's not paying attention to you.

1:08:17.420 --> 1:08:18.420
 They bring your water.

1:08:18.420 --> 1:08:19.420
 It's got a hair in it.

1:08:19.420 --> 1:08:20.420
 They get the food wrong.

1:08:20.420 --> 1:08:21.420
 Yeah.

1:08:21.420 --> 1:08:22.420
 It comes out again.

1:08:22.420 --> 1:08:23.420
 It's ripe, but it's cold.

1:08:23.420 --> 1:08:26.020
 At a certain point you're like, okay, I'm hungry.

1:08:26.020 --> 1:08:28.340
 I'm living an anecdote.

1:08:28.340 --> 1:08:31.800
 This is something that you, if you were at dinner, we could talk about this for years

1:08:31.800 --> 1:08:37.700
 because how great is it that the worst thing that's happening to me is I got to wait an

1:08:37.700 --> 1:08:40.700
 hour for this meal that's going to be cooked wrong, right?

1:08:40.700 --> 1:08:48.460
 That to me is joy is a holding on to that idea that happiness and thriving are possible

1:08:48.460 --> 1:08:53.060
 even when in the moment it's, uh, everything's going the wrong way.

1:08:53.060 --> 1:08:57.540
 Doesn't every moment have the capacity to, uh, fill you with joy then?

1:08:57.540 --> 1:08:58.540
 Yes.

1:08:58.540 --> 1:08:59.540
 Yes.

1:08:59.540 --> 1:09:00.540
 So it's both the shitty moments and the good moments.

1:09:00.540 --> 1:09:01.540
 Yes.

1:09:01.540 --> 1:09:07.060
 But that, see, that's the way I usually talk about love is like, I love life.

1:09:07.060 --> 1:09:08.060
 Yes.

1:09:08.060 --> 1:09:15.180
 And in that, because life can generate every, everything, the pain, the loss, but also just

1:09:15.180 --> 1:09:20.900
 like simple or complicated bliss, all of that, I just love all of that.

1:09:20.900 --> 1:09:26.740
 And that, because it fills me with a kind of, I guess, joy, but joy has a connotation

1:09:26.740 --> 1:09:30.580
 that it's supposed to be somehow positive, like you're supposed to be smiling.

1:09:30.580 --> 1:09:38.060
 To me, you know, man's search for meaning with Viktor Frankl, you know, just it's, you're

1:09:38.060 --> 1:09:42.780
 in the Holocaust, you're in a concentration camp, just having a little bit of food that

1:09:42.780 --> 1:09:45.140
 you didn't expect you will have.

1:09:45.140 --> 1:09:47.740
 Or even just thinking about food.

1:09:47.740 --> 1:09:51.100
 Or what about there's a kid there, you tell them a funny story and you crack them up.

1:09:51.100 --> 1:09:52.100
 Yeah.

1:09:52.100 --> 1:09:54.420
 Like you take away this child's pain for like five minutes.

1:09:54.420 --> 1:09:55.900
 That is the height of joy.

1:09:55.900 --> 1:09:56.900
 Yeah.

1:09:56.900 --> 1:10:01.300
 So to me, like all of like life is like infinitely full of possibility for joy.

1:10:01.300 --> 1:10:02.300
 Yes.

1:10:02.300 --> 1:10:07.460
 And that's what I mean by love, because oftentimes like romantic love is what people think about

1:10:07.460 --> 1:10:08.460
 when they think love.

1:10:08.460 --> 1:10:11.180
 But to me, it's all like part of the same thing.

1:10:11.180 --> 1:10:17.740
 And it's almost like love, romantic love, or love with a friend, friendship is like

1:10:17.740 --> 1:10:20.020
 you both notice each other.

1:10:20.020 --> 1:10:23.380
 It's like dogs, they look at each other and then they look at the thing they're interested

1:10:23.380 --> 1:10:24.380
 in.

1:10:24.380 --> 1:10:27.340
 You both notice each other and that moment of joy.

1:10:27.340 --> 1:10:28.780
 You share that moment of joy together.

1:10:28.780 --> 1:10:29.780
 Yeah.

1:10:29.780 --> 1:10:30.780
 Like the restaurant.

1:10:30.780 --> 1:10:31.780
 The restaurant.

1:10:31.780 --> 1:10:32.780
 Yeah.

1:10:32.780 --> 1:10:39.460
 If you're both almost without conspiring, notice the absurdity of how shitty this meal

1:10:39.460 --> 1:10:40.460
 is.

1:10:40.460 --> 1:10:46.620
 And like that, again, that little glimmer of realization, that's what makes life beautiful.

1:10:46.620 --> 1:10:49.980
 You mentioned your grandmother in Lvov.

1:10:49.980 --> 1:10:52.060
 You were thinking of returning there.

1:10:52.060 --> 1:10:58.440
 The plans got a little bit delayed, but what are you hoping from that trip of going back

1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:01.420
 to Russia, going back to Ukraine?

1:11:01.420 --> 1:11:07.540
 What do you hope to get out of it, but what do you think you will feel?

1:11:07.540 --> 1:11:08.540
 A lot of things.

1:11:08.540 --> 1:11:11.500
 First of all, I'm going with my buddy, Chris Williamson.

1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:13.420
 He hosts the Modern Wisdom Podcast.

1:11:13.420 --> 1:11:15.720
 He is one of my closest friends.

1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:16.720
 We've never met.

1:11:16.720 --> 1:11:17.720
 Oh, really?

1:11:17.720 --> 1:11:18.720
 We've never met.

1:11:18.720 --> 1:11:19.720
 He's in Britain.

1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:23.000
 He's trying to get his ass over here to Austin.

1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:24.540
 He's filling out his form right now.

1:11:24.540 --> 1:11:25.540
 He's too good looking.

1:11:25.540 --> 1:11:26.540
 It's a crime.

1:11:26.540 --> 1:11:29.600
 I call him Apollo and I'm Loki.

1:11:29.600 --> 1:11:32.220
 So right away you have a buddy comedy because we're going to film it, right?

1:11:32.220 --> 1:11:36.940
 You have these two guys who on paper are very dissimilar, but we're very, very close.

1:11:36.940 --> 1:11:40.380
 In which way are you similar and close?

1:11:40.380 --> 1:11:47.500
 I think we're both very intense people, very strong emotionally.

1:11:47.500 --> 1:11:52.500
 We're both very ambitious in the sense that, not in terms of career, but we want to grab

1:11:52.500 --> 1:11:55.260
 life by the short hairs kind of thing.

1:11:55.260 --> 1:11:58.820
 We are just both good experiences.

1:11:58.820 --> 1:12:02.420
 Did he bench more than you or like in the gym?

1:12:02.420 --> 1:12:03.420
 Of course.

1:12:03.420 --> 1:12:04.420
 The guy's jacked.

1:12:04.420 --> 1:12:05.420
 He's just...

1:12:05.420 --> 1:12:06.420
 Because he's so good looking.

1:12:06.420 --> 1:12:09.260
 I think he'd be one of those guys who's mostly biceps.

1:12:09.260 --> 1:12:10.620
 Oh no, no, no.

1:12:10.620 --> 1:12:14.240
 If you go to his Instagram, Chris Will X is the handle.

1:12:14.240 --> 1:12:15.240
 It's head to toe.

1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:16.240
 It's just sculpted.

1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:17.240
 Oh, wow.

1:12:17.240 --> 1:12:18.240
 So he's perfect in every way.

1:12:18.240 --> 1:12:19.240
 That's great.

1:12:19.240 --> 1:12:20.240
 He...

1:12:20.240 --> 1:12:21.900
 What flaws does he have?

1:12:21.900 --> 1:12:22.900
 Because I need...

1:12:22.900 --> 1:12:29.560
 He has bad taste in friends and his accent is all crazy.

1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:30.560
 He pronounces it...

1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:35.880
 He's an underwear muddle, so now I spell it M U D L.

1:12:35.880 --> 1:12:39.540
 Just us two, British and American, and just two different dudes, it's going to be a lot

1:12:39.540 --> 1:12:40.540
 of fun.

1:12:40.540 --> 1:12:43.540
 Although, to be fair, as you know, I'm an underwear model now as well, so...

1:12:43.540 --> 1:12:44.540
 Yeah.

1:12:44.540 --> 1:12:49.100
 We're going to talk that in a second, maybe, but yeah, sheathunderwear.com.

1:12:49.100 --> 1:12:52.100
 Yeah, this episode is brought to you by Sheath Underwear.

1:12:52.100 --> 1:12:53.940
 Are we going to get some pictures eventually?

1:12:53.940 --> 1:12:54.940
 I think we might.

1:12:54.940 --> 1:12:55.940
 Yeah.

1:12:55.940 --> 1:12:56.940
 Yes, I have them on my phone.

1:12:56.940 --> 1:12:57.940
 We'll have them.

1:12:57.940 --> 1:12:59.260
 We could share them right...

1:12:59.260 --> 1:13:01.020
 You could slice it in right here.

1:13:01.020 --> 1:13:05.860
 So to be able to go with someone who is a very close...

1:13:05.860 --> 1:13:08.020
 I mean, we meet and talk like every day, right?

1:13:08.020 --> 1:13:12.620
 So to someone who generally cares about you, who's...

1:13:12.620 --> 1:13:15.320
 He's very, very grounded, right?

1:13:15.320 --> 1:13:19.900
 So like a lot of times I'll have like some concern and he's really good, and if you listen

1:13:19.900 --> 1:13:23.780
 to his show, at slicing through the noise and being like, hold on a second, I can't

1:13:23.780 --> 1:13:24.980
 do the accent yet.

1:13:24.980 --> 1:13:28.820
 Have you considered A, B, and C because, you know, whenever I had this situation, this

1:13:28.820 --> 1:13:29.820
 is what I did.

1:13:29.820 --> 1:13:32.780
 He was really good with that.

1:13:32.780 --> 1:13:34.060
 So to have a...

1:13:34.060 --> 1:13:37.760
 First of all, just like two buddies on a trip is really a lot of fun.

1:13:37.760 --> 1:13:41.660
 Second of all, I know that it's going to be very intense.

1:13:41.660 --> 1:13:44.660
 So for you, you left Russia much later than I did.

1:13:44.660 --> 1:13:45.660
 How old were you?

1:13:45.660 --> 1:13:46.660
 Thirteen.

1:13:46.660 --> 1:13:47.660
 Thirteen, right.

1:13:47.660 --> 1:13:48.660
 So you remember it, I'm sure, very, very well.

1:13:48.660 --> 1:13:49.660
 I left when I was one and a half too.

1:13:49.660 --> 1:13:50.660
 I don't remember it all.

1:13:50.660 --> 1:13:57.820
 To go to the streets where, you know, my family had to go through this stuff to see the...

1:13:57.820 --> 1:13:59.860
 They came to Lviv, they slaughtered all the Jews.

1:13:59.860 --> 1:14:04.020
 I mean, to have that little memorial there that's there now, and to just look around

1:14:04.020 --> 1:14:08.580
 and know, yesterday, basically, they came here, they rounded everyone up.

1:14:08.580 --> 1:14:12.260
 And also, from the other side, you had the Stalinists coming in and starving all the

1:14:12.260 --> 1:14:13.260
 people.

1:14:13.260 --> 1:14:16.420
 It's just to know that so much horror and death.

1:14:16.420 --> 1:14:21.500
 There's this quote I saw once about a woman who went to Auschwitz and she just made the

1:14:21.500 --> 1:14:23.560
 comment like, grass grows here.

1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:27.100
 Because we think, you know, that when it comes to the nature of evil, that you're going to

1:14:27.100 --> 1:14:29.820
 go there, there's going to be this pits of hell or whatever.

1:14:29.820 --> 1:14:34.100
 There's birds, you know, there's, you know, robins hopping around looking for the worms

1:14:34.100 --> 1:14:35.100
 or whatever.

1:14:35.100 --> 1:14:39.140
 They think it's perfectly nice and you stand there to understand that so much suffering

1:14:39.140 --> 1:14:43.020
 happened here or there is going to be very jarring.

1:14:43.020 --> 1:14:47.500
 I know that it's going to be an issue because I speak Russian and not Ukrainian.

1:14:47.500 --> 1:14:50.260
 And to speak Russian to Ukrainians is like a big deal.

1:14:50.260 --> 1:14:51.780
 So that's going to be a concern.

1:14:51.780 --> 1:14:56.420
 I'm also worried about going to Russia because every Russian has this idea that even though

1:14:56.420 --> 1:15:00.580
 they've just met you, they feel that they're in a position to tell you what you're doing

1:15:00.580 --> 1:15:04.320
 wrong with your life, what you should be doing, if they're a cab driver, I have no tolerance

1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:07.180
 for unsolicited advice on it based at all.

1:15:07.180 --> 1:15:08.220
 That's going to be horrible.

1:15:08.220 --> 1:15:10.740
 They're going to be telling me I need to speak Russian better because ты говоришь по

1:15:10.740 --> 1:15:12.300
 русски как даунчик.

1:15:12.300 --> 1:15:13.420
 I'm not hearing it.

1:15:13.420 --> 1:15:15.380
 I'm not interested in hearing it.

1:15:15.380 --> 1:15:21.080
 So that I think, and also, you know, given my upcoming book, The White Pill and covering

1:15:21.080 --> 1:15:26.660
 what happened back in the day under Stalinism and later to see this was the Ljubljanka,

1:15:26.660 --> 1:15:30.260
 this was the basement where they would, you know, this is something that people might

1:15:30.260 --> 1:15:31.260
 not realize.

1:15:31.260 --> 1:15:35.340
 There's a superb film, The Death of Stalin, which is kind of, that's what I do with North

1:15:35.340 --> 1:15:37.500
 Korea, you know, puts a humorous spin on it.

1:15:37.500 --> 1:15:40.180
 Then when you take a step back and you realize what they're actually saying, it's just like

1:15:40.180 --> 1:15:45.360
 it's very, very disturbing how when Stalin was dying, he had a stroke, he's laying there

1:15:45.360 --> 1:15:48.660
 in a pile of his own piss, he's unconscious.

1:15:48.660 --> 1:15:52.340
 Right before he died, he thought the doctors were all plotting against him.

1:15:52.340 --> 1:15:56.380
 So they were being tortured to confess that they were trying to murder him.

1:15:56.380 --> 1:16:01.840
 They had to get the doctors out of the torture chambers to attend to him and they did it.

1:16:01.840 --> 1:16:07.420
 So this kind of thing to like go there, like Red Square and see this is where it happened,

1:16:07.420 --> 1:16:11.740
 to see Lenin's body, like this is the guy who Emma Goldman yelled at.

1:16:11.740 --> 1:16:17.980
 It's going to be really, because I've worked so much in this space, jarring and intense

1:16:17.980 --> 1:16:19.100
 and emotional.

1:16:19.100 --> 1:16:22.700
 And as intense as it is for me sitting here talking to you about it, to see it and to

1:16:22.700 --> 1:16:28.020
 see the faces and to see Cyrillic everywhere, you know, other than Brighton Beach in Brooklyn,

1:16:28.020 --> 1:16:34.380
 it's going to, I'm sure it's going to do a huge number on me because as Western and as

1:16:34.380 --> 1:16:39.380
 a Tupoi Mirikanyets as the Russians will say I am, this is still where I came from.

1:16:39.380 --> 1:16:43.380
 So no matter, to see it face to face, I don't know how I'm going to react, but I don't think

1:16:43.380 --> 1:16:45.860
 it's going to be like, meh.

1:16:45.860 --> 1:16:51.260
 You've assembled a number of essays from anarchist thinkers in a new book called The Anarchist

1:16:51.260 --> 1:16:52.800
 Handbook.

1:16:52.800 --> 1:16:55.740
 You mentioned Emma Goldman.

1:16:55.740 --> 1:17:00.780
 What interesting things do these thinkers agree on and what do they disagree on?

1:17:00.780 --> 1:17:03.180
 The Anarchist Handbook.com is the website.

1:17:03.180 --> 1:17:09.060
 It covers from the 1790s to, I think my essay is the last one from 2014, which a friend

1:17:09.060 --> 1:17:14.020
 of mine who's kind of a mediocre scientist is going to be reading for the audio book.

1:17:14.020 --> 1:17:15.020
 Also podcast.

1:17:15.020 --> 1:17:16.020
 Podcast.

1:17:16.020 --> 1:17:19.180
 I never had, but it's not a podcast anyone would have heard of.

1:17:19.180 --> 1:17:20.900
 It's like Tom Woods but even worse.

1:17:20.900 --> 1:17:29.460
 So what they all agreed on was the illegitimacy of government and also the malevolence of

1:17:29.460 --> 1:17:34.180
 state actors and the consequences of governments.

1:17:34.180 --> 1:17:41.840
 So they range in terms that most people would easily regard as either left or right wing.

1:17:41.840 --> 1:17:48.620
 But it tackles the nature of government and also creates positive non state alternatives

1:17:48.620 --> 1:17:50.620
 from really many different angles.

1:17:50.620 --> 1:17:54.300
 The slogan I have is the black flag, which is the traditional flag of anarchism.

1:17:54.300 --> 1:17:56.580
 The black flag comes in many colors.

1:17:56.580 --> 1:18:01.000
 So they were really all over the map in terms of what they're for, but their disagreement

1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:04.700
 is about the nature of state and the nature of power.

1:18:04.700 --> 1:18:09.180
 And it's very edifying because this is an ideology that's been in many ways swept under

1:18:09.180 --> 1:18:10.180
 the rug.

1:18:10.180 --> 1:18:16.780
 I want to seriously grow up that I can allow people to sit down and read these essays and

1:18:16.780 --> 1:18:22.180
 see for themselves just how beautiful this tapestry over the decades and centuries has

1:18:22.180 --> 1:18:28.440
 been woven about people who genuinely believed in freedom as the most important and how to

1:18:28.440 --> 1:18:32.500
 maximize that for society.

1:18:32.500 --> 1:18:36.220
 So maybe it's useful to talk about a few contrasting thinkers in there.

1:18:36.220 --> 1:18:39.100
 So one is Leo Tolstoy.

1:18:39.100 --> 1:18:40.260
 Oh yeah.

1:18:40.260 --> 1:18:46.060
 Who I think not many people know is an anarchist.

1:18:46.060 --> 1:18:47.060
 Yes.

1:18:47.060 --> 1:18:48.060
 A Christian anarchist.

1:18:48.060 --> 1:18:49.060
 An anarchist.

1:18:49.060 --> 1:18:50.060
 Yeah.

1:18:50.060 --> 1:18:56.180
 So he came to despise government for his deceit and his violence.

1:18:56.180 --> 1:19:00.220
 But to him, the Christian principles of nonviolence, I think are important.

1:19:00.220 --> 1:19:01.220
 Oh yeah.

1:19:01.220 --> 1:19:06.220
 And it's kind of pacifist kind of mindset of, you know, it's better to someone to punch

1:19:06.220 --> 1:19:07.800
 you than to punch them back.

1:19:07.800 --> 1:19:12.500
 So he's in that way, at least I've read he influenced MLK and Gandhi.

1:19:12.500 --> 1:19:19.300
 What do you think about this flavor, color of the anarchist flag of nonviolence, nonviolent

1:19:19.300 --> 1:19:20.300
 opposition?

1:19:20.300 --> 1:19:26.140
 I will put the caveat that it bothers me when people bring up MLK because he's become so

1:19:26.140 --> 1:19:29.540
 corporate and everyone just brings him up without knowing about him.

1:19:29.540 --> 1:19:35.100
 One of the things that Martin Luther King did so very well was that he forced people

1:19:35.100 --> 1:19:40.300
 to face the consequences of what they were putting forward.

1:19:40.300 --> 1:19:41.380
 You want to be racist.

1:19:41.380 --> 1:19:42.500
 You want to be for Jim Crow.

1:19:42.500 --> 1:19:43.780
 You want to be for segregation.

1:19:43.780 --> 1:19:44.780
 Okay.

1:19:44.780 --> 1:19:46.660
 It's easy for you to do that from your living room.

1:19:46.660 --> 1:19:52.980
 Now turn on your news and you see men and women in suits being attacked by dogs, being

1:19:52.980 --> 1:19:58.140
 attacked by fire hoses and beaten by cops just so they could sit on the front of the

1:19:58.140 --> 1:19:59.140
 bus.

1:19:59.140 --> 1:20:03.180
 And now for a lot of people who were still racist, who were still had animus toward black

1:20:03.180 --> 1:20:09.420
 people are watching this and it's going to be a lot harder to be like, I'm okay with

1:20:09.420 --> 1:20:10.420
 this.

1:20:10.420 --> 1:20:15.420
 I'm okay with human beings, even ones I regard as somehow bad or inferior to be beaten and

1:20:15.420 --> 1:20:20.380
 attacked by trained dogs and they're not doing anything in response.

1:20:20.380 --> 1:20:26.060
 That strikes to, I think, a very basic nature of, especially American, like, okay, whatever

1:20:26.060 --> 1:20:30.700
 you're for, I'm not for people getting beaten and attacked when they're not really doing

1:20:30.700 --> 1:20:31.700
 anything.

1:20:31.700 --> 1:20:38.340
 I think pacifism is something that's very easy to make fun of, but people don't underestimate

1:20:38.340 --> 1:20:43.780
 how powerful it is for someone to say, you can do what you want to me.

1:20:43.780 --> 1:20:45.420
 I'm not going to fight you back.

1:20:45.420 --> 1:20:49.260
 I just want to live peacefully and have the same rights as you.

1:20:49.260 --> 1:20:52.620
 And to say, screw you, you should get beaten.

1:20:52.620 --> 1:20:55.180
 That's a hard pill for a lot of people to swallow.

1:20:55.180 --> 1:21:00.260
 So I think he was really, and Gandhi, of course, as well, were excellent in that regard.

1:21:00.260 --> 1:21:02.140
 There's a little bit of Machiavellianism to it.

1:21:02.140 --> 1:21:08.220
 They've both been beatified in regard to saints, but their strategy worked very, very well

1:21:08.220 --> 1:21:09.340
 for their purposes.

1:21:09.340 --> 1:21:16.020
 So I think just all of us, when you see someone in this kind of Christian, I know you're wrong,

1:21:16.020 --> 1:21:21.820
 obviously, it's nothing very highly Christianity, but if he's someone who's willing to take

1:21:21.820 --> 1:21:26.700
 a punch and to say, you could do whatever you want to me, I'm not going to hurt somebody

1:21:26.700 --> 1:21:32.180
 else instinctively, and maybe this is kind of a hack.

1:21:32.180 --> 1:21:35.980
 Most people want to side with that guy, step in between and be like, oh, okay, let's take

1:21:35.980 --> 1:21:39.500
 a step back, because whatever led to this is not tenable.

1:21:39.500 --> 1:21:43.500
 We need to go back to the drawing board if the consequence is people are having these

1:21:43.500 --> 1:21:45.940
 as a result of my decisions and actions.

1:21:45.940 --> 1:21:53.780
 So I think that aspect of anarchism is very, very, in certain contexts, healthy, and much

1:21:53.780 --> 1:21:57.660
 smarter and more sophisticated than people give it credit for.

1:21:57.660 --> 1:22:03.380
 And let's also point out that Tolstoy wrote War and Peace, and he wrote Anna Karenina.

1:22:03.380 --> 1:22:07.200
 So this was not some naive or innocent, whatever word you want to use.

1:22:07.200 --> 1:22:08.980
 He knew the nature of evil.

1:22:08.980 --> 1:22:10.820
 He knew how bad things get.

1:22:10.820 --> 1:22:15.180
 So he wasn't saying at all that human beings are inherently nice and kind.

1:22:15.180 --> 1:22:21.500
 He was saying it's much more effective to not fight back and to force them to face that.

1:22:21.500 --> 1:22:22.500
 I'll give you another example.

1:22:22.500 --> 1:22:28.220
 I was on the show Trigonometry, and I was talking to the host, and one of them talked

1:22:28.220 --> 1:22:35.060
 about how someone he knew had been the Gulag, or his mom was born the Gulag grandma.

1:22:35.060 --> 1:22:39.180
 And after Stalin died and the Soviet Union liberalized and lots of the people in the

1:22:39.180 --> 1:22:44.140
 Gulags were freed by Khrushchev and so on and so forth, I didn't know this, many of

1:22:44.140 --> 1:22:49.020
 the, or some, let's say some, of the guards of the Gulags killed themselves because they

1:22:49.020 --> 1:22:54.420
 had genuinely believed that everyone in these camps was there for a reason.

1:22:54.420 --> 1:22:58.540
 And when they found out that these people were completely innocent, didn't even have

1:22:58.540 --> 1:23:02.980
 trials, and that they were the ones forcing them to work themselves to death and starve,

1:23:02.980 --> 1:23:05.240
 they couldn't deal with that guilt.

1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:13.020
 So when you are a pacifist or non retaliatory and you're forcing someone who's using force,

1:23:13.020 --> 1:23:15.860
 like look what you're doing, look what you've become.

1:23:15.860 --> 1:23:19.820
 For some people, some people don't care, like the guy in Scare Tactics, like I mentioned

1:23:19.820 --> 1:23:24.180
 earlier, where for a lot of others, they're going to be like, okay, is this who I wanted

1:23:24.180 --> 1:23:25.180
 to grow up to be?

1:23:25.180 --> 1:23:27.820
 They will have that little flame of conscience that you and I talked about earlier.

1:23:27.820 --> 1:23:32.860
 They will be like, how did I get to the point where there's this lady who wants to ride

1:23:32.860 --> 1:23:39.200
 the bus and she's lovely dressed, put together, and I have a, sending a dog on her?

1:23:39.200 --> 1:23:40.460
 What kind of person am I?

1:23:40.460 --> 1:23:45.020
 For some of those people, they're going to be like, okay, I can't be a part of this.

1:23:45.020 --> 1:23:46.620
 I don't even understand the politics.

1:23:46.620 --> 1:23:51.540
 I still am racist, but I'm not going to take part in this atrocity.

1:23:51.540 --> 1:23:58.260
 Well, that was for him from the individual perspective, perhaps he calls that Christian,

1:23:58.260 --> 1:24:04.420
 but listening to that voice of conscience, like whatever that is in you.

1:24:04.420 --> 1:24:13.800
 So for Tolstoy, it seems like anarchism from the individual perspective is silencing the

1:24:13.800 --> 1:24:20.180
 rest of the world and listening to the, for him, probably God given voice of conscience.

1:24:20.180 --> 1:24:25.340
 And so that's what it means to live, embody anarchism for him.

1:24:25.340 --> 1:24:27.460
 And to embody Christianity, I would think he would say.

1:24:27.460 --> 1:24:29.220
 But he would see those as basic.

1:24:29.220 --> 1:24:30.220
 Yes, correct.

1:24:30.220 --> 1:24:31.220
 Yeah.

1:24:31.220 --> 1:24:37.860
 So in terms of forms of government, the Christian government is one that's no government.

1:24:37.860 --> 1:24:40.860
 Yeah, correct.

1:24:40.860 --> 1:24:45.500
 What do you think about that as advice for an individual?

1:24:45.500 --> 1:24:46.500
 Turn the other cheek.

1:24:46.500 --> 1:24:50.340
 Do you think, I tend to believe that that's a really good way to live.

1:24:50.340 --> 1:24:52.180
 I think it's very underrated.

1:24:52.180 --> 1:24:53.740
 And this is me talking.

1:24:53.740 --> 1:24:59.540
 I think a lot of times when someone, let's suppose you're having an argument and, but

1:24:59.540 --> 1:25:01.180
 you have to pick your battles, right?

1:25:01.180 --> 1:25:04.540
 Let's suppose you're having a heated argument and someone says something very cruel to you,

1:25:04.540 --> 1:25:07.860
 where you have attempted to double down and hit back twice as hard.

1:25:07.860 --> 1:25:11.020
 But if it's someone who at all cares about you, where they're just in the moment and

1:25:11.020 --> 1:25:14.880
 you just stop and you just say, did you hear what you just said to me?

1:25:14.880 --> 1:25:19.180
 For some cases, that person will take a step back and be like, just like when I snapped

1:25:19.180 --> 1:25:24.420
 at Michael at Bitstein years ago, I'd be like, wow, okay, this is bad.

1:25:24.420 --> 1:25:25.420
 This is bad.

1:25:25.420 --> 1:25:26.420
 I'm sorry.

1:25:26.420 --> 1:25:31.060
 And they kind of, it's kind of like they have to get to 10 before they control delete to

1:25:31.060 --> 1:25:32.060
 use your language.

1:25:32.060 --> 1:25:33.060
 Thank you.

1:25:33.060 --> 1:25:34.060
 Yeah.

1:25:34.060 --> 1:25:35.060
 Buffer overflow.

1:25:35.060 --> 1:25:36.060
 I appreciate that.

1:25:36.060 --> 1:25:39.160
 And for some, they're going to, they're going to just twist the knife.

1:25:39.160 --> 1:25:41.820
 But I think this is a very useful technique.

1:25:41.820 --> 1:25:47.280
 And also you can also sleep well at night cause you could be like as much as this person

1:25:47.280 --> 1:25:51.080
 tried to hurt me, I still didn't reciprocate.

1:25:51.080 --> 1:25:56.580
 And yeah, I, I took that punch and it sucks, but at least I never said anything that I

1:25:56.580 --> 1:25:58.340
 could feel guilty about.

1:25:58.340 --> 1:25:59.620
 Exactly.

1:25:59.620 --> 1:26:05.620
 Do you think that's ultimately a good way to implement anarchy in your personal life?

1:26:05.620 --> 1:26:12.500
 Anarchy, implementing anarchy in your personal life just means respecting people's boundaries.

1:26:12.500 --> 1:26:18.420
 It means not forcing people to do things they otherwise wouldn't want to do.

1:26:18.420 --> 1:26:25.160
 I think you then have to take a case by case, like there's so many human interactions that

1:26:25.160 --> 1:26:29.620
 are required for life and there's tension and all those kinds of things.

1:26:29.620 --> 1:26:30.620
 It's not always.

1:26:30.620 --> 1:26:31.620
 Am I being naive?

1:26:31.620 --> 1:26:32.620
 Are you innocent?

1:26:32.620 --> 1:26:33.620
 You're being so naive.

1:26:33.620 --> 1:26:34.620
 No.

1:26:34.620 --> 1:26:35.620
 Did you put the hat on?

1:26:35.620 --> 1:26:36.620
 The hat's on the other head now.

1:26:36.620 --> 1:26:41.100
 Well, I had to take off the hat cause it's like Frodo with the ring.

1:26:41.100 --> 1:26:43.700
 I was starting to feel like powerful.

1:26:43.700 --> 1:26:49.940
 I wanted to give you orders and I'm like, no, I just, I think there's a ways of dealing

1:26:49.940 --> 1:26:58.760
 with the tensions that are natural to human interactions that can't be simply, you know,

1:26:58.760 --> 1:27:05.780
 it's not as simple as saying you want to respect the freedom of others and the boundaries of

1:27:05.780 --> 1:27:06.780
 others.

1:27:06.780 --> 1:27:10.900
 It's like you both have to agree on stuff and work something out.

1:27:10.900 --> 1:27:15.220
 And the mechanisms of that agreement, the game theory of that agreement requires different

1:27:15.220 --> 1:27:16.820
 hacks and strategies.

1:27:16.820 --> 1:27:27.780
 And the question is for an anarchist collective that's well functioning, what kind of hacks,

1:27:27.780 --> 1:27:33.960
 what kind of ways of behavior are more likely to be productive and not, you know, that that's

1:27:33.960 --> 1:27:37.420
 almost like the question, do you want to turn the other cheek or do you want to stand your

1:27:37.420 --> 1:27:39.160
 ground really firmly?

1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:42.780
 When somebody is an asshole to you, you walk away.

1:27:42.780 --> 1:27:46.480
 Or when somebody is an asshole to you, you turn the other cheek and give them a chance

1:27:46.480 --> 1:27:52.060
 to rise to the best version of themselves and then find a common ground kind of thing.

1:27:52.060 --> 1:27:56.940
 It's an open question of how to form those collectives when there's people with difficult

1:27:56.940 --> 1:27:59.780
 childhoods and all that kind of stuff.

1:27:59.780 --> 1:28:03.300
 Well, this also comes down to what is your relationship with this person?

1:28:03.300 --> 1:28:04.300
 Is this out of character?

1:28:04.300 --> 1:28:08.100
 If you and I got into a disagreement, all of a sudden, you started getting very personal.

1:28:08.100 --> 1:28:09.100
 First of all, I'd be very hurt.

1:28:09.100 --> 1:28:11.240
 But then I'd be like, this is out of character for Lex.

1:28:11.240 --> 1:28:13.620
 I'm sure I could be like, whoa, let's take a pause here.

1:28:13.620 --> 1:28:14.780
 Like you're getting heated.

1:28:14.780 --> 1:28:16.420
 I'm trying to work this out.

1:28:16.420 --> 1:28:17.420
 What's going on here?

1:28:17.420 --> 1:28:19.220
 And you get a kind of a meta conversation.

1:28:19.220 --> 1:28:21.880
 But again, you and I have a relationship of mutual respect.

1:28:21.880 --> 1:28:28.300
 So as opposed to if it was a stranger who just wants a piece of you, it's just like

1:28:28.300 --> 1:28:29.780
 you are coming at me not correct.

1:28:29.780 --> 1:28:31.740
 I don't have to reciprocate in kind.

1:28:31.740 --> 1:28:36.220
 I'm not going to shoot you, but I'm not going to pretend that you deserve respect when you're

1:28:36.220 --> 1:28:39.020
 treating me with such contempt.

1:28:39.020 --> 1:28:44.480
 I do defer, especially with people I know, because this is smart long term game theory

1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:46.180
 as well as the right thing to do.

1:28:46.180 --> 1:28:48.840
 I do try to give them the benefit of the doubt at first, right?

1:28:48.840 --> 1:28:51.140
 Because if you're going to go aggro, you can't go back.

1:28:51.140 --> 1:28:54.940
 You could always go from like, let me hear them out and then then I could go aggro.

1:28:54.940 --> 1:28:56.980
 So there's a big asymmetry there.

1:28:56.980 --> 1:28:57.980
 Yeah.

1:28:57.980 --> 1:29:02.340
 And that's, I mean, I don't think anyone has the answer to this question is, is that the

1:29:02.340 --> 1:29:03.460
 right strategy?

1:29:03.460 --> 1:29:06.660
 To me, game theoretically, it seems the right strategy is to...

1:29:06.660 --> 1:29:09.420
 With reciprocity is what game theory says is the right strategy.

1:29:09.420 --> 1:29:13.720
 They did the prisoner's dilemma and they found tit for tat is the one that's the most advantageous.

1:29:13.720 --> 1:29:16.180
 So that's for when it's perfectly rational actors.

1:29:16.180 --> 1:29:23.620
 But when you have, I mean, there's noise that there's a, I think, benefit to just, even

1:29:23.620 --> 1:29:27.860
 if they keep being shitty to you, still being nice to them.

1:29:27.860 --> 1:29:30.060
 Well then there's the inverse where girls are turned off.

1:29:30.060 --> 1:29:34.380
 Some people are like, if you're in a relationship and not just girls, but like some people,

1:29:34.380 --> 1:29:37.940
 when you're kind to them, they find you less attractive, right?

1:29:37.940 --> 1:29:40.620
 That is kind of this weird, what am I supposed to do?

1:29:40.620 --> 1:29:43.380
 Like you're only into me if I'm mean to you.

1:29:43.380 --> 1:29:46.840
 I don't want to be mean, but then I'm getting punished for doing the right thing.

1:29:46.840 --> 1:29:48.340
 That's another tricky one.

1:29:48.340 --> 1:29:52.540
 And I mean, this is nothing that necessarily do with anarchism so much as like, you know,

1:29:52.540 --> 1:29:54.320
 human beings are infinitely complex.

1:29:54.320 --> 1:29:55.820
 We don't often know the backstory.

1:29:55.820 --> 1:30:00.320
 Like for example, just yesterday, Jay, who's here is one of my closest friends.

1:30:00.320 --> 1:30:02.260
 I had a dinner with a bunch of people.

1:30:02.260 --> 1:30:06.340
 I couldn't bring a plus four, so he wasn't invited.

1:30:06.340 --> 1:30:07.700
 He didn't know the circumstances.

1:30:07.700 --> 1:30:09.220
 He just thought we were having dinner without him.

1:30:09.220 --> 1:30:10.320
 He was hurt.

1:30:10.320 --> 1:30:14.660
 Once I spelled it out, he completely understood and I felt horrible because for me to have

1:30:14.660 --> 1:30:19.380
 any of my friends feel left out is just a very, very cruel thing.

1:30:19.380 --> 1:30:23.580
 And I felt bad and I'm glad to apologize again publicly that that's ended up being the circumstances.

1:30:23.580 --> 1:30:27.460
 But yeah, a lot of times we're also in Plato's cave.

1:30:27.460 --> 1:30:30.780
 When you're dealing with somebody else, you have very, very limited information about

1:30:30.780 --> 1:30:32.660
 their background and circumstances.

1:30:32.660 --> 1:30:37.220
 And that's why I will always, if it's someone I even have a little bit of a relationship

1:30:37.220 --> 1:30:41.860
 with, try to give them the benefit of the doubt because I found, especially this comes

1:30:41.860 --> 1:30:45.380
 from being a coauthor, when you coauthor books and you're walking in other people's shoes,

1:30:45.380 --> 1:30:47.560
 you don't know a lot of the information.

1:30:47.560 --> 1:30:51.180
 So a lot of times it's just a misunderstanding.

1:30:51.180 --> 1:30:56.260
 But isn't that a fundamentally anarchist question of how we figure out this puzzle

1:30:56.260 --> 1:30:59.620
 of human complexities in order to form voluntary collectives?

1:30:59.620 --> 1:31:04.140
 Like when you have to figure that out, how to make people feel good, how to make people...

1:31:04.140 --> 1:31:05.140
 I agree.

1:31:05.140 --> 1:31:06.140
 That's fair.

1:31:06.140 --> 1:31:10.820
 I think not only anarchists have to think about this as my point, of course.

1:31:10.820 --> 1:31:11.820
 Well...

1:31:11.820 --> 1:31:13.780
 But we have to think about it more than others do.

1:31:13.780 --> 1:31:14.780
 Right.

1:31:14.780 --> 1:31:19.180
 I feel like I should try to argue against anarchism at some point, out of love, out

1:31:19.180 --> 1:31:20.180
 of love.

1:31:20.180 --> 1:31:21.180
 Okay.

1:31:21.180 --> 1:31:22.180
 And so because people...

1:31:22.180 --> 1:31:23.180
 Out of joy.

1:31:23.180 --> 1:31:29.340
 People enjoy seeing me, what is it, when like Ben Shapiro argues against like a 20 year

1:31:29.340 --> 1:31:30.340
 old feminist.

1:31:30.340 --> 1:31:32.540
 Ben Shapiro destroys high school students with facts and legends.

1:31:32.540 --> 1:31:40.440
 This is this video of Michael Miles destroys a Marxist, Russian, communist pig.

1:31:40.440 --> 1:31:43.540
 So anarchism is opposed to hierarchies.

1:31:43.540 --> 1:31:45.980
 Well that's left anarchism, anarcho communism, yeah.

1:31:45.980 --> 1:31:46.980
 The state.

1:31:46.980 --> 1:31:48.740
 But there are many hierarchies that are not the state.

1:31:48.740 --> 1:31:49.740
 We have a hierarchy here.

1:31:49.740 --> 1:31:50.740
 This is your show.

1:31:50.740 --> 1:31:51.740
 I'm differential to you.

1:31:51.740 --> 1:31:52.740
 Right.

1:31:52.740 --> 1:31:53.740
 But they're...

1:31:53.740 --> 1:31:54.740
 Okay.

1:31:54.740 --> 1:31:55.740
 Rigid hierarchies.

1:31:55.740 --> 1:31:56.740
 Forced hierarchies is the...

1:31:56.740 --> 1:31:57.740
 Forced hierarchies.

1:31:57.740 --> 1:31:58.740
 Forced hierarchies.

1:31:58.740 --> 1:31:59.740
 Okay.

1:31:59.740 --> 1:32:04.940
 So humans, when left on their own accord, they form hierarchies naturally.

1:32:04.940 --> 1:32:06.620
 Yes, inevitably in my opinion.

1:32:06.620 --> 1:32:07.620
 Inevitably.

1:32:07.620 --> 1:32:08.620
 Which is why I disagree with the left anarchists.

1:32:08.620 --> 1:32:14.380
 I think it's not a coherent thing to argue for nonhierarchical relationships, even in

1:32:14.380 --> 1:32:15.380
 theory.

1:32:15.380 --> 1:32:16.380
 It doesn't make sense to me.

1:32:16.380 --> 1:32:22.140
 And I know the old school anarchists will call me stupid or uninformed, but I've never

1:32:22.140 --> 1:32:25.940
 been able to even wrap my head around this claim that you could have relationships without

1:32:25.940 --> 1:32:26.940
 hierarchy.

1:32:26.940 --> 1:32:27.940
 Right.

1:32:27.940 --> 1:32:30.980
 So this is a certain sense in which we're living in an anarchism now.

1:32:30.980 --> 1:32:36.780
 And I don't mean just like, because the nations, as you've said, are in anarchism relative

1:32:36.780 --> 1:32:42.700
 to each other, but isn't the United States just a collective that was formed in anarchy?

1:32:42.700 --> 1:32:47.180
 And this is just the collective that we're operating under, this hierarchy that was naturally

1:32:47.180 --> 1:32:48.180
 formed.

1:32:48.180 --> 1:32:49.180
 It wasn't...

1:32:49.180 --> 1:32:50.180
 Well, the United States was not naturally formed.

1:32:50.180 --> 1:32:51.820
 It was formed by force and by fiat.

1:32:51.820 --> 1:32:56.780
 But to your point, I stress this throughout the book.

1:32:56.780 --> 1:33:00.500
 I always say this anarchism is not a location, it's a relationship.

1:33:00.500 --> 1:33:05.020
 So yeah, you and I do have a hierarchy and this is your show, but neither of us really

1:33:05.020 --> 1:33:06.620
 has an authority over the other.

1:33:06.620 --> 1:33:08.140
 Like I'm here voluntarily.

1:33:08.140 --> 1:33:09.340
 You can kick me out if you want.

1:33:09.340 --> 1:33:10.780
 I can leave it anyone.

1:33:10.780 --> 1:33:13.920
 Neither of us has the power to force the other to be in this relationship we've chosen.

1:33:13.920 --> 1:33:17.420
 My lawyer, I defer to his judgment.

1:33:17.420 --> 1:33:18.580
 He's not forcing me to do it.

1:33:18.580 --> 1:33:20.940
 He gives me his advice and I could take it or leave it.

1:33:20.940 --> 1:33:21.940
 Same with the doctor.

1:33:21.940 --> 1:33:25.300
 So there is a clearly like who's in charge and who's not in charge, but they're not in

1:33:25.300 --> 1:33:27.620
 a position to impose their will on everybody else.

1:33:27.620 --> 1:33:33.900
 And you could very easily see John is Stephanie's lawyer and Stephanie is John's doctor.

1:33:33.900 --> 1:33:37.980
 And in each of those contexts, one has this position of ostensible authority over the

1:33:37.980 --> 1:33:38.980
 other.

1:33:38.980 --> 1:33:42.140
 So anarchism is in fact not some utopian crazy thing.

1:33:42.140 --> 1:33:46.660
 It is the norm of human relationships where you meet people.

1:33:46.660 --> 1:33:48.100
 You're not necessarily equal.

1:33:48.100 --> 1:33:50.980
 Someone's going to be taller, someone's going to be stronger, someone's smarter, wealthier

1:33:50.980 --> 1:33:51.980
 with others.

1:33:51.980 --> 1:33:57.860
 So you're not at all thinking I am here and I could tell you what to do and you are legally

1:33:57.860 --> 1:34:01.460
 or morally obligated to follow my wishes.

1:34:01.460 --> 1:34:03.260
 That is the basis of anarchism.

1:34:03.260 --> 1:34:09.480
 So in what way is the United States imposing by force something on you, do you think?

1:34:09.480 --> 1:34:12.820
 If you leave your house, you will go to jail.

1:34:12.820 --> 1:34:15.720
 My money being taken from me via taxation.

1:34:15.720 --> 1:34:19.180
 But don't you have the freedom to not operate under that?

1:34:19.180 --> 1:34:22.820
 No, but that's like, yeah, like technically if someone comes up to you and mugs you and

1:34:22.820 --> 1:34:26.120
 says your money or your life, you are making a choice.

1:34:26.120 --> 1:34:30.380
 But what the anarchist argument is, they're not in a position to force you to make that

1:34:30.380 --> 1:34:31.380
 choice.

1:34:31.380 --> 1:34:35.900
 That is not morally binding, even though they have practically the power to force you into

1:34:35.900 --> 1:34:37.260
 that dilemma.

1:34:37.260 --> 1:34:41.300
 But you have the freedom to live under the United States or not.

1:34:41.300 --> 1:34:42.300
 So even...

1:34:42.300 --> 1:34:46.680
 Yeah, the argument is if you don't like it, leave, right?

1:34:46.680 --> 1:34:53.940
 Not necessarily leave like geographically, but there's ways to live outside the force

1:34:53.940 --> 1:34:55.300
 of the United States.

1:34:55.300 --> 1:34:57.400
 There's ways, it's just very difficult to operate that way.

1:34:57.400 --> 1:35:01.320
 But that's like saying you could outrun the mugger, which is true, but the issue is does

1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:08.180
 that mugger have the right to tell you at gunpoint, you're either giving me your money

1:35:08.180 --> 1:35:12.420
 or I'm going to shoot you or secret plan C, you get to run away.

1:35:12.420 --> 1:35:14.580
 Is that person a moral actor?

1:35:14.580 --> 1:35:16.540
 And the anarchist answer is never.

1:35:16.540 --> 1:35:21.380
 And just one more thing, the anarchist view is the difference between that mugger and

1:35:21.380 --> 1:35:25.660
 the government is only an air of legitimacy.

1:35:25.660 --> 1:35:27.180
 Literally they're morally identical.

1:35:27.180 --> 1:35:33.180
 So is it possible that every hierarchy that gets big enough and successful enough such

1:35:33.180 --> 1:35:41.300
 that it can monopolize a bunch of services it provides, isn't it always going to be amoral

1:35:41.300 --> 1:35:44.540
 in your sense, the way the United States government is amoral?

1:35:44.540 --> 1:35:47.780
 I don't want to say just like the United States government is amoral because that implies

1:35:47.780 --> 1:35:50.500
 the United States government is uniquely or especially amoral.

1:35:50.500 --> 1:35:51.500
 Governments, I apologize.

1:35:51.500 --> 1:35:53.740
 I just want to clarify that because I know you didn't mean that and I don't want that

1:35:53.740 --> 1:35:56.460
 to be the implication.

1:35:56.460 --> 1:35:57.460
 Can you repeat the question?

1:35:57.460 --> 1:35:58.460
 I'm sorry.

1:35:58.460 --> 1:36:01.540
 So like won't every Okay, so that's right.

1:36:01.540 --> 1:36:03.300
 So that's progressive economics.

1:36:03.300 --> 1:36:07.980
 So the argument is in any market at a certain point, things tend to centralize and then

1:36:07.980 --> 1:36:12.540
 that organization de facto can dictate price, can dictate so on and so forth.

1:36:12.540 --> 1:36:14.740
 That is completely historical.

1:36:14.740 --> 1:36:20.020
 If you look at any market, the trend is always towards decentralization, the music industry,

1:36:20.020 --> 1:36:21.020
 right?

1:36:21.020 --> 1:36:23.460
 When we were kids, there were four or five record labels.

1:36:23.460 --> 1:36:25.740
 They were the ones who made all the songs that you're going to see in the Billboard

1:36:25.740 --> 1:36:27.560
 Top 100 with a few exceptions.

1:36:27.560 --> 1:36:30.020
 Now anyone can go to direct to market.

1:36:30.020 --> 1:36:35.100
 If you look at TV stations, right, it went from CBS, NBC, ABC, then you got Fox, then

1:36:35.100 --> 1:36:36.620
 you had cable, which is 100.

1:36:36.620 --> 1:36:39.380
 Now you have satellite, which have sounds around the world and you have YouTube, which

1:36:39.380 --> 1:36:40.700
 is literally infinite.

1:36:40.700 --> 1:36:45.780
 So as technology improves and as wealth increases, which is a function of free enterprise, you

1:36:45.780 --> 1:36:52.900
 are going to always have more and more choice, even within a monopoly, Coca Cola, right?

1:36:52.900 --> 1:36:56.460
 This is an example I used, I think in the new right, when we were kids, every terrible

1:36:56.460 --> 1:37:02.220
 comedian would be like, oh, now that I've got diet caffeine free Coke, what's next?

1:37:02.220 --> 1:37:03.880
 It's like, yeah, that's good.

1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:08.900
 You want to have, what was his name, Cayman, the guy who invented the Segway.

1:37:08.900 --> 1:37:14.860
 If you go, Dean Cayman, if you go into some restaurants right now, you will have those

1:37:14.860 --> 1:37:15.860
 machines.

1:37:15.860 --> 1:37:19.580
 You have like 80 kinds of Cokes and then you could have whatever flavor you want to add

1:37:19.580 --> 1:37:20.580
 to it.

1:37:20.580 --> 1:37:22.700
 Grape, cherry, lemon, lime, so on and so forth.

1:37:22.700 --> 1:37:27.200
 So in any field, you're going to have more and more competition.

1:37:27.200 --> 1:37:31.660
 You're going to have less competition and less choices when the state gets involved

1:37:31.660 --> 1:37:33.640
 because the state wants control.

1:37:33.640 --> 1:37:37.980
 The state wants one big neck with one leash around it and that way it could just pull

1:37:37.980 --> 1:37:39.940
 that dog in one direction or another.

1:37:39.940 --> 1:37:44.380
 And you saw this last year with the lockdowns, Carol Roth wrote this amazing book called

1:37:44.380 --> 1:37:49.620
 The War on Small Business and she talked about, we have seen for the first time in history

1:37:49.620 --> 1:37:55.380
 a massive wealth transfer from small and medium business towards organizations like Target

1:37:55.380 --> 1:37:59.140
 and Amazon who made trillions of dollars last year.

1:37:59.140 --> 1:38:03.540
 Whereas mom and pop, which to me at least is like the acme of American achievement.

1:38:03.540 --> 1:38:08.780
 You come to America, you have a fruit stand, a laundromat, you make socks, whatever it

1:38:08.780 --> 1:38:11.860
 is, you're that unique artisan creating something special.

1:38:11.860 --> 1:38:14.780
 They're the ones who didn't last whereas Target and Amazon did.

1:38:14.780 --> 1:38:18.460
 So when you have the state involvement, it will always be in favor of Jeff Bezos and

1:38:18.460 --> 1:38:23.100
 for the simple reason that it's going to be a lot easier for Jeff Bezos to get Nancy Pelosi

1:38:23.100 --> 1:38:27.780
 and Mitch McConnell on the phone than it is for me making socks on Etsy.

1:38:27.780 --> 1:38:34.620
 Your sense is that there'll be less and less over time Jeff Bezos is like whatever industry

1:38:34.620 --> 1:38:42.100
 we look at, there's be less, there's a trend towards decentralization across all industries.

1:38:42.100 --> 1:38:45.660
 And when I say decentralization, I just mean choice, right?

1:38:45.660 --> 1:38:50.100
 So if you look at again, networks, you're going to, if you were in the 80s and you had

1:38:50.100 --> 1:38:55.220
 a network just for LGBT issues, first of all, it's going to be complete heretical.

1:38:55.220 --> 1:38:58.420
 That's not going to happen and there's not going to be enough necessarily people identifies

1:38:58.420 --> 1:38:59.740
 that to have an audience.

1:38:59.740 --> 1:39:01.020
 Then there was something called logo.

1:39:01.020 --> 1:39:03.640
 They have that and there's lots of other shows like that in this way.

1:39:03.640 --> 1:39:06.580
 So more specific, look at websites.

1:39:06.580 --> 1:39:12.940
 I am positive that you and I, if we wanted to look up breeding guinea pigs, would find

1:39:12.940 --> 1:39:17.580
 thousands of websites about different breeds and all this other stuff 20 years ago, 30

1:39:17.580 --> 1:39:21.660
 years ago, like you're going to have two books and they're not going to be dynamic as these

1:39:21.660 --> 1:39:24.560
 new breeds are developed.

1:39:24.560 --> 1:39:31.780
 So at the same time it does, following on your argument, it does seem easier to move

1:39:31.780 --> 1:39:37.020
 and immigrate from state to state within the United States and to other countries.

1:39:37.020 --> 1:39:45.020
 Do you think that's a form of freedom that embodies anarchism where you can resist the

1:39:45.020 --> 1:39:47.540
 force of state by choosing where you live?

1:39:47.540 --> 1:39:51.860
 To some extent, but the line of people, some of these boomers will go at me on Twitter

1:39:51.860 --> 1:39:55.100
 if I'm going after the police or something and be like, if you don't like America, get

1:39:55.100 --> 1:39:56.100
 out of here.

1:39:56.100 --> 1:39:59.780
 And I tell them freedom means I do what I want, not what you want.

1:39:59.780 --> 1:40:01.640
 Freedom means I don't have to move.

1:40:01.640 --> 1:40:02.880
 You don't have to move.

1:40:02.880 --> 1:40:04.020
 Free speech is a good example.

1:40:04.020 --> 1:40:05.880
 It doesn't mean I have to be on Twitter, right?

1:40:05.880 --> 1:40:06.880
 Twitter has the right to ban me.

1:40:06.880 --> 1:40:11.460
 But what I'm saying is I'm saying something and you don't like it, too bad.

1:40:11.460 --> 1:40:15.860
 You're the one who has to accommodate me because I have a right to do what I want with my person

1:40:15.860 --> 1:40:18.100
 as long as I'm being peaceful.

1:40:18.100 --> 1:40:24.660
 So I guess I'm trying to get to the difference between the state and what you would naturally

1:40:24.660 --> 1:40:31.300
 want in anarchy, which is like a security company, all of those things.

1:40:31.300 --> 1:40:36.640
 They will, as they become successful, start looking more and more like the state.

1:40:36.640 --> 1:40:42.180
 Because you get to elect, you give them money, they have leaders.

1:40:42.180 --> 1:40:49.380
 What's the difference between a government and a very successful service provider in

1:40:49.380 --> 1:40:50.380
 anarchism?

1:40:50.380 --> 1:40:55.420
 Well, this gets a little confused in America as big companies necessarily are hand in hand

1:40:55.420 --> 1:40:57.580
 with the government ended up in bed with them.

1:40:57.580 --> 1:41:00.020
 The answer to this question is a long, complicated one.

1:41:00.020 --> 1:41:02.340
 And thankfully, it's all in the Anarchist Handbook.

1:41:02.340 --> 1:41:06.000
 There was an essay by Murray Rothbard who Dave Smith, this is the essay that converted

1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:07.000
 Dave Smith.

1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:11.100
 So maybe it's not as good as it could have been otherwise called Anatomy of the State.

1:41:11.100 --> 1:41:16.480
 And Murray Rothbard points out that state is the only agency in a country which gets

1:41:16.480 --> 1:41:18.580
 its goods through force.

1:41:18.580 --> 1:41:23.980
 The state is the only agency that is not a producer, but inherently a parasite because

1:41:23.980 --> 1:41:28.860
 it does not get its money voluntarily, but through taxation and by imposing its values

1:41:28.860 --> 1:41:30.140
 on a country.

1:41:30.140 --> 1:41:34.840
 That is what makes a state uniquely different from, let's suppose, an Amazon or a Barnes

1:41:34.840 --> 1:41:36.380
 and Noble or a Target.

1:41:36.380 --> 1:41:42.980
 Jeff Bezos does not have the authority or the moral legitimacy to get an army and go

1:41:42.980 --> 1:41:48.900
 into somebody's house, whereas Andrew Cuomo or Ron DeSantis, Donald Trump and Barack Obama

1:41:48.900 --> 1:41:50.160
 certainly do.

1:41:50.160 --> 1:42:00.900
 But is it possible that to reframe, so Jeff Bezos does if he hires a security force, also

1:42:00.900 --> 1:42:06.060
 is it possible to reframe taxation as a form of payment?

1:42:06.060 --> 1:42:11.660
 If it was done much better, if you could pay this collective that we call government in

1:42:11.660 --> 1:42:18.780
 ways where you could pay for things that you care for, your money would be much more directly

1:42:18.780 --> 1:42:21.120
 contributing to the things you care for.

1:42:21.120 --> 1:42:25.740
 If you care for a service like healthcare, you'll be able to buy essentially insurance

1:42:25.740 --> 1:42:26.740
 from the government.

1:42:26.740 --> 1:42:29.780
 Why am I buying insurance from the government as opposed to insurance from an insurance

1:42:29.780 --> 1:42:30.780
 company?

1:42:30.780 --> 1:42:33.140
 What do you perceive as the difference between a tax and a price?

1:42:33.140 --> 1:42:34.140
 Do you see the difference?

1:42:34.140 --> 1:42:40.980
 Yes, I know on the surface level, I'm trying to get deeply to say there's a lot of similarities.

1:42:40.980 --> 1:42:45.860
 But what I'm saying is there's one essential difference, which is taxes are imposed on

1:42:45.860 --> 1:42:48.940
 you and you have no choice.

1:42:48.940 --> 1:42:49.940
 Here's an example.

1:42:49.940 --> 1:42:53.780
 My book, Ego and Hubris, my biography, it goes for $500 on eBay.

1:42:53.780 --> 1:42:54.780
 Someone paid for it.

1:42:54.780 --> 1:42:55.780
 Some crazy person.

1:42:55.780 --> 1:42:59.940
 People were showing me that it's on Amazon for $3,000, something like that.

1:42:59.940 --> 1:43:01.360
 You could put a million for it.

1:43:01.360 --> 1:43:03.100
 You could charge whatever price you want.

1:43:03.100 --> 1:43:05.460
 The question is, is someone paying that $3,000 for it?

1:43:05.460 --> 1:43:07.400
 Is someone paying that million for it?

1:43:07.400 --> 1:43:11.820
 It's actually the buyer who establishes the price because the seller can put any price

1:43:11.820 --> 1:43:14.340
 that he wants, $80 trillion.

1:43:14.340 --> 1:43:18.220
 But unless someone's paying that amount and clearing the market, that price has literally

1:43:18.220 --> 1:43:19.540
 no real meaning.

1:43:19.540 --> 1:43:22.180
 It's not an indicator of value or worth or market price.

1:43:22.180 --> 1:43:25.100
 Taxation, on the other hand, is by fiat.

1:43:25.100 --> 1:43:32.180
 I can decide it's fair that you, Lex, have to pay 40% and Joe has to pay 45%.

1:43:32.180 --> 1:43:36.100
 Joe and Lex are in no position to be like, this price is too high.

1:43:36.100 --> 1:43:43.380
 Not only is that money set just completely out of their hands, for people who are employees,

1:43:43.380 --> 1:43:45.700
 it's taken out of their paychecks before they even see it.

1:43:45.700 --> 1:43:48.140
 So they don't even have the choice to be like, you know what?

1:43:48.140 --> 1:43:50.940
 I agree that the government has the right to pay taxation.

1:43:50.940 --> 1:43:52.340
 Here's my check for 40%.

1:43:52.340 --> 1:43:53.340
 It's going on.

1:43:53.340 --> 1:43:56.620
 It's a completely different paradigm than you are when you're paying for price.

1:43:56.620 --> 1:43:59.980
 The government provides a lot of services in the current system.

1:43:59.980 --> 1:44:05.180
 But there's no service the government provides that would not be provided better, more efficiently,

1:44:05.180 --> 1:44:07.180
 and with more choices in a market.

1:44:07.180 --> 1:44:08.180
 That's a hypothesis.

1:44:08.180 --> 1:44:09.180
 No, that's very likely.

1:44:09.180 --> 1:44:10.180
 Well, that's not a...

1:44:10.180 --> 1:44:11.180
 I can demonstrate this to you very easily.

1:44:11.180 --> 1:44:15.940
 I love it when you get flustered.

1:44:15.940 --> 1:44:17.940
 This is what people like.

1:44:17.940 --> 1:44:18.940
 It's so cute.

1:44:18.940 --> 1:44:19.940
 The robot's...

1:44:19.940 --> 1:44:21.940
 Don't make me put on the hat again.

1:44:21.940 --> 1:44:22.940
 The robot has a fire.

1:44:22.940 --> 1:44:26.300
 There's smoke coming out of his ears.

1:44:26.300 --> 1:44:28.300
 What is price?

1:44:28.300 --> 1:44:33.620
 I will tax love.

1:44:33.620 --> 1:44:36.660
 I think of the government as a kind of subscription service.

1:44:36.660 --> 1:44:37.660
 No, no.

1:44:37.660 --> 1:44:38.780
 That's the anarchist view.

1:44:38.780 --> 1:44:42.620
 The anarchist view of private security would be a subscription service.

1:44:42.620 --> 1:44:44.060
 So that's exactly correct.

1:44:44.060 --> 1:44:50.100
 But everyone hates when you sign up to a gym, and then you realize in the contract, it's

1:44:50.100 --> 1:44:54.940
 very difficult to cancel that membership, and then they up the price.

1:44:54.940 --> 1:45:00.540
 There's a lot of unpleasant things with a subscription service that then you can elect

1:45:00.540 --> 1:45:03.620
 to go to another subscription service.

1:45:03.620 --> 1:45:06.980
 Or you could go and Yelp and complain, and if there's enough people to do that, the gym

1:45:06.980 --> 1:45:08.140
 will be receptive.

1:45:08.140 --> 1:45:11.060
 Look at the power of Yelp versus the power of the vote.

1:45:11.060 --> 1:45:13.380
 Well, we could talk about that too.

1:45:13.380 --> 1:45:18.740
 So you're saying Yelp is more effective than voting.

1:45:18.740 --> 1:45:25.340
 The thing is, I agree with you, but you take a further step.

1:45:25.340 --> 1:45:31.180
 You say that Yelp is ethical and moral, and voting is amoral.

1:45:31.180 --> 1:45:34.580
 Or like not voting, but government is amoral.

1:45:34.580 --> 1:45:38.960
 So like it's not only is one more efficient than the other, you're saying like, because

1:45:38.960 --> 1:45:44.460
 I would say government sucks at doing what it does, and it's gotten a lot better at it,

1:45:44.460 --> 1:45:50.900
 and I believe it can keep getting better as it gets smaller and it leverages companies

1:45:50.900 --> 1:45:51.900
 more and more.

1:45:51.900 --> 1:45:59.620
 But you're saying, no, no, no, government is fundamentally as an idea gets in the way

1:45:59.620 --> 1:46:03.420
 of companies that should be doing those things anyway.

1:46:03.420 --> 1:46:07.660
 I just think that companies, when you take away government, will start looking like government.

1:46:07.660 --> 1:46:11.520
 Just because something looks like something does not mean it's the same.

1:46:11.520 --> 1:46:16.740
 If someone puts out a yarmulke and tefillin and they go to shul, they're not Jewish.

1:46:16.740 --> 1:46:18.220
 Right.

1:46:18.220 --> 1:46:23.580
 The basic objection you have with government, because you can leave, like I apologize that

1:46:23.580 --> 1:46:26.740
 this is that stupid Twitter cliche statement.

1:46:26.740 --> 1:46:34.380
 But your opposition to this idea of leaving the United States is that it's just, it's

1:46:34.380 --> 1:46:35.380
 a lot of effort.

1:46:35.380 --> 1:46:36.380
 It's too much friction.

1:46:36.380 --> 1:46:37.380
 That's not the option.

1:46:37.380 --> 1:46:43.940
 The opposition is in the introduction to the book, I say anarchism can be summed up in

1:46:43.940 --> 1:46:44.940
 one sentence.

1:46:44.940 --> 1:46:46.500
 You do not speak for me.

1:46:46.500 --> 1:46:47.900
 Everything else is application.

1:46:47.900 --> 1:46:53.180
 So the claim that somebody I've never met or who I voted against, let's say, I hate

1:46:53.180 --> 1:46:56.980
 Donald Trump, I despise him, I want Hillary Clinton to be president.

1:46:56.980 --> 1:46:59.940
 Too bad Trump's your president, that's not what I want.

1:46:59.940 --> 1:47:05.200
 The idea that this person can come on me and make any claims onto one second of my time,

1:47:05.200 --> 1:47:09.700
 as opposed to try to persuade me, that is something that I, an anarchist, regard as

1:47:09.700 --> 1:47:12.780
 inherently evil and nonsensical.

1:47:12.780 --> 1:47:18.180
 But to operate large organizations, like you see this with cryptocurrency, there's governance,

1:47:18.180 --> 1:47:20.220
 you have to make difficult decisions.

1:47:20.220 --> 1:47:22.140
 It's a block size wars for Bitcoin.

1:47:22.140 --> 1:47:23.140
 Sure.

1:47:23.140 --> 1:47:27.060
 So you will, there is a voting mechanism often with membership when you're a subscription

1:47:27.060 --> 1:47:28.060
 service.

1:47:28.060 --> 1:47:31.740
 But see, the thing is, you're using these words and you're switching definitions.

1:47:31.740 --> 1:47:35.980
 Because like, if I go to a store, I can technically say I'm voting for Tropicana orange juice

1:47:35.980 --> 1:47:37.700
 as opposed to another one.

1:47:37.700 --> 1:47:41.800
 But to kind of say, oh, well, you're making a choice there for every choice is a vote.

1:47:41.800 --> 1:47:44.780
 I don't, I think that that's something that the Venn diagram is not.

1:47:44.780 --> 1:47:47.060
 No, I literally mean vote in this case, not money.

1:47:47.060 --> 1:47:48.060
 Okay.

1:47:48.060 --> 1:47:52.460
 There's some decisions, like, should Bitcoin have increases block size?

1:47:52.460 --> 1:47:53.460
 Okay.

1:47:53.460 --> 1:47:56.820
 There's a bunch of different, they're called soft forks or hard forks.

1:47:56.820 --> 1:48:00.940
 Oh, I'm not saying you should never vote, like stockholders have to vote, right?

1:48:00.940 --> 1:48:01.940
 Exactly.

1:48:01.940 --> 1:48:02.940
 But there's no pretense.

1:48:02.940 --> 1:48:04.420
 Here's, let's look at this.

1:48:04.420 --> 1:48:06.280
 If you want to build robots, right?

1:48:06.280 --> 1:48:09.060
 You would sit down with the company, you would, you guys would be like, we should do this

1:48:09.060 --> 1:48:10.780
 kind of robot, we should do this kind of robot.

1:48:10.780 --> 1:48:14.860
 The stockholders would have a vote or the board in proportion to their investment in

1:48:14.860 --> 1:48:15.860
 the firm.

1:48:15.860 --> 1:48:22.480
 Me, who knows nothing about robots, the idea that I'm in a position to walk in and be like,

1:48:22.480 --> 1:48:28.060
 this is what you should do is crazy and bizarre and wrong because I'm not in a foreign position.

1:48:28.060 --> 1:48:33.500
 So what democracy does is it forces people who run businesses well to run businesses

1:48:33.500 --> 1:48:37.080
 poorly by people who don't know how to run businesses at all.

1:48:37.080 --> 1:48:39.220
 That's the, that's one of the many concerns.

1:48:39.220 --> 1:48:43.300
 But you're saying that's the fundamental property of the state.

1:48:43.300 --> 1:48:47.820
 I have a sense that the state could become as effective as what we think of as companies.

1:48:47.820 --> 1:48:49.060
 I mean, as.

1:48:49.060 --> 1:48:53.720
 This is why they can't, because the state does not have access to data the way that

1:48:53.720 --> 1:48:55.020
 firms do.

1:48:55.020 --> 1:48:59.660
 And this is one of Ludwig von Mises's great points, what he called the calculation problem.

1:48:59.660 --> 1:49:04.900
 If I'm looking at comic books, right, and I have Detective Comics, if Detective Comics

1:49:04.900 --> 1:49:12.500
 26 is a thousand and Detective Comics 28 is a thousand and Detective Comics 27 is 50,000,

1:49:12.500 --> 1:49:16.780
 that is telling me that even if I don't know anything about comics, that Detective Comics

1:49:16.780 --> 1:49:21.620
 27 is either very, very scarce for some reason or very, very desirable.

1:49:21.620 --> 1:49:24.880
 It's the first appearance of Batman, whatever, but you don't need to know that to just look

1:49:24.880 --> 1:49:28.620
 at this data and be like, okay, this is the market, tell me something.

1:49:28.620 --> 1:49:33.120
 If prices are set by the government, which the government is a monopoly, I have no way

1:49:33.120 --> 1:49:35.220
 of picking those winners or losers.

1:49:35.220 --> 1:49:40.620
 I don't have that data of supply and demand of an entire nation or a world of people making

1:49:40.620 --> 1:49:47.420
 individual decisions and having price be dynamic and informing me as the organization where

1:49:47.420 --> 1:49:49.380
 I should allocate my resources.

1:49:49.380 --> 1:49:58.100
 So the price is a really strong signal that allows you to operate a voluntary collective

1:49:58.100 --> 1:50:01.900
 where people get what they want and don't get what they don't want.

1:50:01.900 --> 1:50:04.580
 And it tells me what to produce, what not to produce.

1:50:04.580 --> 1:50:08.860
 And it also is great because if I see this podcasting industry, which didn't exist five

1:50:08.860 --> 1:50:15.380
 years ago, and now these people are making bank, that tells me as someone who is an investor,

1:50:15.380 --> 1:50:19.540
 they're making 50%, whatever, 10% profit on their capital.

1:50:19.540 --> 1:50:22.260
 In the plant industry, it's 2%.

1:50:22.260 --> 1:50:26.940
 If I'm going to further my capital to this 10%, and that's going to lower the profit

1:50:26.940 --> 1:50:29.060
 rate as that builds up.

1:50:29.060 --> 1:50:32.500
 And that is how markets are regulated, voluntarily.

1:50:32.500 --> 1:50:38.880
 But the word government, I just think it's possible to have collectives of human beings

1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:42.220
 that represent others based on their voluntary...

1:50:42.220 --> 1:50:46.540
 Yes, of course, you have private governance.

1:50:46.540 --> 1:50:50.040
 Any company, you can have a CEO, you can have a board of directors.

1:50:50.040 --> 1:50:57.980
 But then you, I just, it starts to look very similar to me, a successful private governance

1:50:57.980 --> 1:51:04.260
 mechanism at a scale of the United States starts looking a whole lot like the current

1:51:04.260 --> 1:51:07.600
 government of the United States.

1:51:07.600 --> 1:51:12.300
 Even Amazon, I don't think is anything close to the federal budget, size wise or budget

1:51:12.300 --> 1:51:13.580
 wise or power wise.

1:51:13.580 --> 1:51:14.580
 No.

1:51:14.580 --> 1:51:19.600
 So you're saying you just, it's not even state, it's almost like anything at that size.

1:51:19.600 --> 1:51:21.500
 You want to keep things smaller.

1:51:21.500 --> 1:51:29.160
 And I don't, markets are not going to combine to that level of the state because Jeff Bezos

1:51:29.160 --> 1:51:34.100
 will never be in a position to tell everyone in America, I'm going to take 40% of your

1:51:34.100 --> 1:51:35.580
 money before you even see it.

1:51:35.580 --> 1:51:37.380
 That to me is actually unclear.

1:51:37.380 --> 1:51:41.580
 We don't know that to be true, where that Google or Amazon can't grow to the size.

1:51:41.580 --> 1:51:46.180
 If you take away the US government, I'm not so sure that Amazon can't grow to the size

1:51:46.180 --> 1:51:47.180
 of the US government.

1:51:47.180 --> 1:51:52.700
 Okay, so worst case scenario is we're back where we started, right?

1:51:52.700 --> 1:51:54.260
 That's not worst case scenario.

1:51:54.260 --> 1:51:58.600
 But the concern is that Google is going to be the federal government?

1:51:58.600 --> 1:51:59.600
 That's not the concern.

1:51:59.600 --> 1:52:02.580
 I'm saying like, this is what it looks like when Google is the federal government.

1:52:02.580 --> 1:52:10.140
 It's not, it's like, to me, the US government is our best attempt so far to have large scale

1:52:10.140 --> 1:52:12.460
 representation of people's interest.

1:52:12.460 --> 1:52:16.580
 It really sucks, but it's our best attempt so far and the question is how to improve

1:52:16.580 --> 1:52:17.580
 it.

1:52:17.580 --> 1:52:21.740
 Like if you take away all, if you take away the US government, I'm trying to see how do

1:52:21.740 --> 1:52:27.780
 we improve on that level, that scale of representation of people's interest.

1:52:27.780 --> 1:52:30.740
 Let me give you one example that people could wrap their hands around very easily.

1:52:30.740 --> 1:52:34.780
 I'm against government police monopoly, I'm for private security, right?

1:52:34.780 --> 1:52:37.180
 You don't have to be an anarchist to understand this.

1:52:37.180 --> 1:52:42.780
 Can everyone agree, or at least as a hypothesis, everyone can wrap their heads around, here's

1:52:42.780 --> 1:52:44.980
 a big concern, 911, right?

1:52:44.980 --> 1:52:47.340
 I've heard this 911 call, it's very chilling.

1:52:47.340 --> 1:52:50.100
 There's a kid in a closet, his family's being murdered outside, right?

1:52:50.100 --> 1:52:51.860
 He has to call 911, he's whispering.

1:52:51.860 --> 1:52:53.940
 It's horrifying to hear.

1:52:53.940 --> 1:52:59.540
 There's no reason why the number I call for my family's being murdered is the same number

1:52:59.540 --> 1:53:02.660
 I call for the fire department is the same number I call for an ambulance.

1:53:02.660 --> 1:53:04.620
 What if instead it operated like Uber?

1:53:04.620 --> 1:53:09.220
 You have buttons on your phone, if there's a real emergency, like someone's gun flyers,

1:53:09.220 --> 1:53:14.660
 someone's being killed, you press this and it sends instead of the one police district,

1:53:14.660 --> 1:53:18.320
 whatever company is nearby, you have a bunch of them and they're the ones who are going

1:53:18.320 --> 1:53:20.260
 to come to your house to save you.

1:53:20.260 --> 1:53:22.280
 People can wrap their heads around that very easily.

1:53:22.280 --> 1:53:27.500
 That is one very clear way to go from having a government security monopoly towards having

1:53:27.500 --> 1:53:29.660
 a more free enterprise system.

1:53:29.660 --> 1:53:34.360
 So when you apply that to pretty much anything, it doesn't become that complicated of an alternative.

1:53:34.360 --> 1:53:42.140
 So what I would, you're going to criticize this, but I believe the government, it's like

1:53:42.140 --> 1:53:49.480
 the parenting thing we've talked about earlier, I think it creates a safe space for gov, for

1:53:49.480 --> 1:53:52.820
 I'm for safe spaces, so I'm not going to laugh at you about that.

1:53:52.820 --> 1:53:54.060
 I want people to be safe.

1:53:54.060 --> 1:53:57.340
 But for a safe space for entrepreneurship.

1:53:57.340 --> 1:54:02.180
 So I believe that good government, hold on a sec, give me a sec, give me a sec.

1:54:02.180 --> 1:54:03.180
 Sure, sure.

1:54:03.180 --> 1:54:04.180
 I'm sorry.

1:54:04.180 --> 1:54:05.180
 I'm sorry.

1:54:05.180 --> 1:54:06.180
 You're right.

1:54:06.180 --> 1:54:07.180
 You're right.

1:54:07.180 --> 1:54:08.180
 I'm sorry.

1:54:08.180 --> 1:54:11.700
 I think government gives a opportunity for companies to out compete it.

1:54:11.700 --> 1:54:12.700
 Yes.

1:54:12.700 --> 1:54:16.140
 UPS, FedEx, 100%, not a question.

1:54:16.140 --> 1:54:23.780
 So I believe you need to have private schools, government to give a chance for UPS, FedEx,

1:54:23.780 --> 1:54:30.660
 for SpaceX, oh there's an X in there, to pop up and then government will naturally back

1:54:30.660 --> 1:54:32.260
 off from that place.

1:54:32.260 --> 1:54:36.300
 So like you, but you need the innovators to step in and build the thing.

1:54:36.300 --> 1:54:37.300
 Okay.

1:54:37.300 --> 1:54:38.300
 Like you can't just.

1:54:38.300 --> 1:54:39.840
 When has government ever backed off though?

1:54:39.840 --> 1:54:40.840
 That never happens.

1:54:40.840 --> 1:54:47.660
 I back, well, from FedEx and UPS, from SpaceX, from Amazon.

1:54:47.660 --> 1:54:49.500
 Wait, wait, hold on.

1:54:49.500 --> 1:54:52.720
 The US Postal Service still competes with FedEx and UPS.

1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:53.940
 So here's the other thing.

1:54:53.940 --> 1:54:54.940
 Not nearly.

1:54:54.940 --> 1:54:55.940
 Not well, but they still exist.

1:54:55.940 --> 1:54:56.940
 And the point is.

1:54:56.940 --> 1:54:57.940
 They're dying.

1:54:57.940 --> 1:55:00.840
 But UPS and FedEx are taxed.

1:55:00.840 --> 1:55:04.320
 So not only are they paying for their own company, they're paying for this competitor.

1:55:04.320 --> 1:55:06.220
 This is the essential difference.

1:55:06.220 --> 1:55:10.340
 Imagine if you didn't have UPS, excuse me, the federal government and no post office.

1:55:10.340 --> 1:55:13.940
 So you had FedEx, you have DHL, you have US Postal Service and many others.

1:55:13.940 --> 1:55:22.480
 How about in this scenario, UPS has the capacity to take 20% of FedEx's DHL and couriers money

1:55:22.480 --> 1:55:25.220
 and put in their own pocket and they never have to do anything in return.

1:55:25.220 --> 1:55:28.340
 This is going to be an enormous advantage of UPS.

1:55:28.340 --> 1:55:32.180
 And then when you add the addition that UPS is not necessarily going to be more efficient

1:55:32.180 --> 1:55:35.300
 than the others, this is going to be a huge distortion in the market.

1:55:35.300 --> 1:55:39.180
 Can you imagine if your podcast, you just automatically got 20% of the views of everybody

1:55:39.180 --> 1:55:40.180
 else?

1:55:40.180 --> 1:55:42.420
 I mean, would there be any incentive for you to be great?

1:55:42.420 --> 1:55:47.060
 Or you could just sit in your laurels and do whatever you want even more than now.

1:55:47.060 --> 1:55:48.500
 It's hard to imagine more than now.

1:55:48.500 --> 1:55:51.300
 That's because you're a robot and lack imagination.

1:55:51.300 --> 1:55:56.260
 I think there just has to be, of course you can do it completely without government, but

1:55:56.260 --> 1:55:57.260
 government...

1:55:57.260 --> 1:55:58.260
 That's all I need to hear.

1:55:58.260 --> 1:55:59.260
 Okay.

1:55:59.260 --> 1:56:00.260
 That's all I need to hear.

1:56:00.260 --> 1:56:01.260
 Show's over.

1:56:01.260 --> 1:56:02.260
 Show's over.

1:56:02.260 --> 1:56:03.260
 What else you can do without government at the end?

1:56:03.260 --> 1:56:04.260
 Let us try.

1:56:04.260 --> 1:56:09.860
 The question is that safety net that's needed for entrepreneurship, that's needed for, I'm

1:56:09.860 --> 1:56:14.480
 sorry to say, but I have a sense that there needs to be a bit of a safety net for freedom.

1:56:14.480 --> 1:56:18.700
 I'm much more comfortable with saying you need a safety net for freedom than you need

1:56:18.700 --> 1:56:20.200
 one for entrepreneurs.

1:56:20.200 --> 1:56:25.740
 The beauty of markets is with your startup, if you have a startup and it completely fails,

1:56:25.740 --> 1:56:28.440
 the only person who's screwed is you and your investors.

1:56:28.440 --> 1:56:32.620
 If I'm a government and I make a startup, the entire society fails, like the Iraq war.

1:56:32.620 --> 1:56:36.460
 If I have this cockamamie plan, everyone else doesn't have a choice.

1:56:36.460 --> 1:56:40.340
 They are both funding it and sometimes even drafted or forced into it.

1:56:40.340 --> 1:56:44.260
 The safety net, the antlers, getting back to the early anarchists, one of the things

1:56:44.260 --> 1:56:49.380
 that I admire about them, the inaugural communists, the old school left anarchists, is people

1:56:49.380 --> 1:56:51.620
 don't remember what context they were in.

1:56:51.620 --> 1:56:55.280
 They were in context without a welfare state, they're immigrating in huge numbers from

1:56:55.280 --> 1:57:00.060
 Eastern Europe, you go to the Tenement Museum in New York, people like 12 to a room, kids

1:57:00.060 --> 1:57:03.420
 are working in factories, they're either working in factories or they have to starve.

1:57:03.420 --> 1:57:06.500
 It's not that their parents didn't love them, it's that the parents didn't have birth control,

1:57:06.500 --> 1:57:09.960
 which was a felony, and they also were in a position to put food on the table for their

1:57:09.960 --> 1:57:13.180
 kids because they're uneducated and the jobs are paying nothing.

1:57:13.180 --> 1:57:17.980
 You could understand why Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Proudhon, and all these other figures

1:57:17.980 --> 1:57:24.100
 were like, this is untenable, we see Carnegie with 80,000 mansions, whereas this lady whose

1:57:24.100 --> 1:57:29.780
 husband died at age 30, who's never been to high school or even junior high school, has

1:57:29.780 --> 1:57:33.340
 10 kids, how's she going to put food on the table, it's not going to happen.

1:57:33.340 --> 1:57:36.780
 You could understand why they would be like, all right, we need to seize this money and

1:57:36.780 --> 1:57:39.120
 distribute it around the people, that makes a lot of sense.

1:57:39.120 --> 1:57:44.940
 In a contemporary context, where food is much cheaper, where shelter to some extent is more

1:57:44.940 --> 1:57:53.180
 available, when medical care, we're so oblivious to how bad things were that we see things

1:57:53.180 --> 1:57:56.140
 are bad now, so we assume that they were better than in some contexts.

1:57:56.140 --> 1:57:58.580
 They were much, much worse there in many contexts.

1:57:58.580 --> 1:58:03.260
 So if you're going to make an argument for government, for me, the strongest argument

1:58:03.260 --> 1:58:08.900
 is like food stamps or like free lunches for children, because I agree that would be very

1:58:08.900 --> 1:58:13.940
 inefficient and it's going to probably make them obese because you're going to have Nabisco

1:58:13.940 --> 1:58:18.420
 lobbying to make sure that if you're going to have this protein, you're not going to

1:58:18.420 --> 1:58:19.780
 give the kids an Oreo, aren't you?

1:58:19.780 --> 1:58:24.220
 These kids are poor, you want them to have some pleasure and that's going to have deleterious

1:58:24.220 --> 1:58:25.220
 effects.

1:58:25.220 --> 1:58:29.780
 But if the choice is an inefficient government program and mass starvation, that is one where

1:58:29.780 --> 1:58:36.200
 as an anarchist, I could easily see making the argument for that one.

1:58:36.200 --> 1:58:39.500
 Even though I think very clearly private charity would be more efficient and distribute it

1:58:39.500 --> 1:58:40.500
 more effectively.

1:58:40.500 --> 1:58:42.780
 But at that point, I don't really care about efficiency.

1:58:42.780 --> 1:58:46.620
 If you're throwing out food to make sure these kids get fed, I don't care.

1:58:46.620 --> 1:58:53.900
 So would engagement in military conflict be one of the biggest negative things about the

1:58:53.900 --> 1:58:55.860
 state to you?

1:58:55.860 --> 1:58:57.820
 Yeah, of course.

1:58:57.820 --> 1:58:59.420
 War is the state at its worst.

1:58:59.420 --> 1:59:05.140
 So if we take away war or make it defensive instead of aggressive, yeah.

1:59:05.140 --> 1:59:09.400
 I mean, wouldn't that be a huge step forward if war instead of regarded, we're always,

1:59:09.400 --> 1:59:11.100
 this is what drives me crazy.

1:59:11.100 --> 1:59:15.020
 We're taught as kids in school that war is a last resort.

1:59:15.020 --> 1:59:16.580
 And I agree with that.

1:59:16.580 --> 1:59:21.700
 And yet when you look at the corporate press, war is always the first response.

1:59:21.700 --> 1:59:26.580
 And these people do not talk about what war means.

1:59:26.580 --> 1:59:31.860
 They'll show examples during the Bush years of soldiers coming home in caskets, which

1:59:31.860 --> 1:59:34.680
 already is an unacceptable price in many cases for me.

1:59:34.680 --> 1:59:39.020
 But they don't even pretend to care about the people overseas whose countries we've

1:59:39.020 --> 1:59:41.660
 ransacked and lives we've ruined.

1:59:41.660 --> 1:59:43.020
 And it's just like, well, what are you going to do?

1:59:43.020 --> 1:59:44.640
 Not ransack those countries?

1:59:44.640 --> 1:59:48.900
 So that war to me is the state at its worst.

1:59:48.900 --> 1:59:55.140
 See, I think that there is value from small government that doesn't engage in wars.

1:59:55.140 --> 2:00:01.620
 I do think that the kind of collectives that you imagine functioning well would look like

2:00:01.620 --> 2:00:04.260
 the best version of government that I imagine.

2:00:04.260 --> 2:00:08.620
 So I see them as the same.

2:00:08.620 --> 2:00:10.940
 I think a lot of it is just terminology.

2:00:10.940 --> 2:00:15.740
 I have no problem saying that I'm using the word anarchism incorrectly and to go for what

2:00:15.740 --> 2:00:16.740
 you want.

2:00:16.740 --> 2:00:19.500
 I have no problem with that or anything, really.

2:00:19.500 --> 2:00:21.380
 Because like I said, life is beautiful.

2:00:21.380 --> 2:00:29.380
 But nevertheless, you wrote the essay, why I'm not going to vote this time or ever.

2:00:29.380 --> 2:00:33.980
 Why I won't vote this year or any other year or any year.

2:00:33.980 --> 2:00:34.980
 And the basic idea.

2:00:34.980 --> 2:00:37.500
 I hope you do a better job reading it than you just read that title.

2:00:37.500 --> 2:00:42.220
 I guess you'll take as many takes as necessary.

2:00:42.220 --> 2:00:45.340
 I'll read it in Russian and then pay somebody to translate it.

2:00:45.340 --> 2:00:46.340
 This isn't even Russian at all.

2:00:46.340 --> 2:00:47.340
 He's just making up words.

2:00:47.340 --> 2:00:48.340
 Where'd you find this guy?

2:00:48.340 --> 2:00:49.340
 You get what you pay for.

2:00:49.340 --> 2:00:50.340
 Yeah, exactly.

2:00:50.340 --> 2:00:51.340
 This is anarchy.

2:00:51.340 --> 2:00:56.340
 This is what you wanted.

2:00:56.340 --> 2:01:09.140
 Like your basic summary is, let me see, if pressed, the simplest explanation I have for

2:01:09.140 --> 2:01:16.180
 refusing to vote is this, I don't vote for the same exact reasons that I don't take communion.

2:01:16.180 --> 2:01:22.020
 No matter how admirable he is or how much I agree with him, the Pope isn't the steward

2:01:22.020 --> 2:01:27.820
 over my soul, nor is any president the leader of my life.

2:01:27.820 --> 2:01:32.420
 This does not make me ignorant or evil any more than not being a Christian makes me ignorant

2:01:32.420 --> 2:01:33.560
 or evil.

2:01:33.560 --> 2:01:38.780
 If I need representation, I will hire the most qualified person to do so.

2:01:38.780 --> 2:01:44.300
 Isn't voting our current best developed way of hiring the most qualified person to represent

2:01:44.300 --> 2:01:45.740
 you on some things?

2:01:45.740 --> 2:01:50.900
 No, because if I have a lawyer and the lawyer screws up, I can fire him.

2:01:50.900 --> 2:01:53.420
 If I vote for someone, I don't get who I want.

2:01:53.420 --> 2:01:55.300
 I get for who my neighbors want.

2:01:55.300 --> 2:01:57.700
 So that makes no sense.

2:01:57.700 --> 2:02:00.740
 Representation means I want you to speak for me.

2:02:00.740 --> 2:02:04.660
 Whereas voting is like, I kind of want you, but I'll take what I can get and I'm going

2:02:04.660 --> 2:02:06.260
 to take what I could get regardless.

2:02:06.260 --> 2:02:08.060
 So what's the point?

2:02:08.060 --> 2:02:11.700
 In governments, again, that's what Bitcoin is.

2:02:11.700 --> 2:02:15.540
 You want to be represented in deciding what to do, but once...

2:02:15.540 --> 2:02:17.680
 Wait, Bitcoin isn't picking a person.

2:02:17.680 --> 2:02:19.980
 They're not picking a president of Bitcoin.

2:02:19.980 --> 2:02:20.980
 They're picking an idea.

2:02:20.980 --> 2:02:21.980
 Yeah.

2:02:21.980 --> 2:02:22.980
 It's more like a referendum.

2:02:22.980 --> 2:02:29.740
 And to me, a referendum is much more coherent and defensible than it is voting for a representative

2:02:29.740 --> 2:02:35.940
 because if I'm voting for Joe Biden, I'm saying this person speaks for me for abortion, taxation,

2:02:35.940 --> 2:02:38.420
 environmental policy, immigration, war, right?

2:02:38.420 --> 2:02:42.660
 The odds that unless you're a complete NPC, that this one person will speak for you for

2:02:42.660 --> 2:02:47.340
 everything and will deliver what he promised and has the power to deliver what he promises

2:02:47.340 --> 2:02:48.340
 is not true.

2:02:48.340 --> 2:02:54.100
 Whereas if I have Brexit, if I say I want Britain to remain part of the European Union

2:02:54.100 --> 2:02:57.900
 to say yes or no question, that makes a lot more sense to me.

2:02:57.900 --> 2:03:02.300
 But even that is not pure democracy because going back to the idea of the circulation

2:03:02.300 --> 2:03:06.780
 of elites, which James Burnham talked about, Pareto and Moscow and all them, you're still

2:03:06.780 --> 2:03:11.380
 going to have someone telling you what you can and can't vote for and how these questions

2:03:11.380 --> 2:03:12.380
 are framed.

2:03:12.380 --> 2:03:17.920
 So in contradiction to what the left anarchist said, some element of hierarchy is always

2:03:17.920 --> 2:03:21.700
 going to be inevitable.

2:03:21.700 --> 2:03:27.980
 So listen, I agree with this aspect very much so that we should be voting for ideas and

2:03:27.980 --> 2:03:33.740
 issues not voting for leaders, for leaders to represent us across the full spectrum of

2:03:33.740 --> 2:03:34.740
 issues.

2:03:34.740 --> 2:03:35.980
 It seems to make no sense.

2:03:35.980 --> 2:03:36.980
 Okay, good.

2:03:36.980 --> 2:03:38.340
 Yeah, this is great.

2:03:38.340 --> 2:03:44.460
 But I do think there should be a leader, I do believe in voting for representatives to

2:03:44.460 --> 2:03:48.500
 debate, to be communicators of ideas to us.

2:03:48.500 --> 2:03:52.740
 But let me start to interrupt you, but you could have those two things.

2:03:52.740 --> 2:03:56.900
 For example, wouldn't this be an improvement if they have that now, you have a referendum,

2:03:56.900 --> 2:04:01.080
 you want tax rates to be 30 or 40, whatever percent, you have the guy leading the campaign

2:04:01.080 --> 2:04:05.940
 for 50, fight for 50, then you have the lady leading the campaign for 40, fight for 40,

2:04:05.940 --> 2:04:09.420
 they'll go out there, they can have debates, they can talk about the issue, but you're

2:04:09.420 --> 2:04:12.340
 still not voting for one of them, you're voting for the issue.

2:04:12.340 --> 2:04:16.220
 That makes much more sense to me than I'm going to vote for him and hope that he puts

2:04:16.220 --> 2:04:18.980
 forward 50 and that depends on 99 other senators.

2:04:18.980 --> 2:04:19.980
 Exactly.

2:04:19.980 --> 2:04:23.740
 But also, I mean, I do like the idea of voting for certain people to debate certain ideas.

2:04:23.740 --> 2:04:25.600
 Yes, I think that's a major improvement.

2:04:25.600 --> 2:04:27.980
 But the final vote should be based on the idea.

2:04:27.980 --> 2:04:29.340
 So okay, so we agree.

2:04:29.340 --> 2:04:35.740
 That would be nice to have, plus no wars, and then you'll stop tweeting so aggressively.

2:04:35.740 --> 2:04:39.180
 And to decriminalize things that don't hurt people.

2:04:39.180 --> 2:04:40.180
 Drugs.

2:04:40.180 --> 2:04:43.900
 Drugs especially, prostitution is a big one.

2:04:43.900 --> 2:04:47.240
 And this is me talking, all cops are criminals.

2:04:47.240 --> 2:04:52.580
 There's no one, or maybe other than abused children, who needs access to the police other

2:04:52.580 --> 2:04:54.300
 than sex workers.

2:04:54.300 --> 2:04:58.580
 They're the ones who are the most likely to really put themselves in danger situation,

2:04:58.580 --> 2:05:02.340
 so they need to be able to call security, because that's why they have pimps.

2:05:02.340 --> 2:05:06.980
 Because you're a woman dealing with some strange dudes who are a lot of the time going to have

2:05:06.980 --> 2:05:11.660
 weird kinks, you want to be able to be sure, even if you don't approve of prostitution,

2:05:11.660 --> 2:05:15.780
 think it's horrible, that she's not going to be raped and murdered and have no consequences.

2:05:15.780 --> 2:05:19.620
 And if you're going to say, oh, well, she's a prostitute, she can't be raped.

2:05:19.620 --> 2:05:23.120
 Just think for a second, if you're agreeing to sleep with somebody, and then he starts

2:05:23.120 --> 2:05:26.400
 choking you and beating the crap out of you and saying it's now it's a dom situation,

2:05:26.400 --> 2:05:29.020
 that is clearly beyond the pale of salt.

2:05:29.020 --> 2:05:35.780
 And the same thing with drugs, heroin, cocaine, crack.

2:05:35.780 --> 2:05:40.720
 The people that need help the most are the ones who are addicted to those drugs and putting

2:05:40.720 --> 2:05:41.720
 punishment.

2:05:41.720 --> 2:05:44.700
 Let's suppose you think drug dealers should be in jail, right?

2:05:44.700 --> 2:05:51.300
 It is very hard for me to say that someone who sells cocaine should be treated or in

2:05:51.300 --> 2:05:55.340
 the same building as someone who rapes children, or as a murderer.

2:05:55.340 --> 2:05:58.780
 These are not similar types of evil, even if you believe that that drug dealer is an

2:05:58.780 --> 2:05:59.780
 evil person.

2:05:59.780 --> 2:06:00.780
 Yeah, I have.

2:06:00.780 --> 2:06:06.100
 I mean, there's an essay in there called by Alexander Berkman, who was Emma Goldman's

2:06:06.100 --> 2:06:09.120
 partner on prisons and crime.

2:06:09.120 --> 2:06:13.220
 And this is leftism at its best, forgetting the person is forgotten.

2:06:13.220 --> 2:06:17.180
 And the fact that we have the world's largest prison population, the fact that so many people

2:06:17.180 --> 2:06:20.660
 are just like, oh, you commit a crime, just put them in jail, throw away the key.

2:06:20.660 --> 2:06:24.260
 At the very least, if you want to be totally immoral about it, it's expensive.

2:06:24.260 --> 2:06:28.240
 And second of all, the concept that all criminals should be locked in a room together in these

2:06:28.240 --> 2:06:31.820
 kind of largely inhuman conditions, and that's going to help people.

2:06:31.820 --> 2:06:33.980
 I don't think that that's the ideal mechanism.

2:06:33.980 --> 2:06:40.220
 Yeah, I tend to believe, I usually don't speak so negatively about politicians, but I do think

2:06:40.220 --> 2:06:46.660
 that politicians have done more evil in the war on drugs than did the people that are

2:06:46.660 --> 2:06:49.020
 supposed to be the criminals in this picture.

2:06:49.020 --> 2:06:52.860
 And I'll give you another example of how this is the anarchist critique of power.

2:06:52.860 --> 2:06:56.420
 Hunter Biden, and I'm not making fun of him, I'm not taking shots at him.

2:06:56.420 --> 2:07:01.260
 He had an article in the New Yorker, where he talks about when he was in LA, he was buying

2:07:01.260 --> 2:07:05.660
 crack and there was a misunderstanding or like he left the crack pipe in the Hertz car

2:07:05.660 --> 2:07:07.720
 and then blah, blah, blah, there's an issue.

2:07:07.720 --> 2:07:11.100
 He's admitting to a felony in writing to a reporter.

2:07:11.100 --> 2:07:13.980
 And I'm sure this was within the statute of limitations.

2:07:13.980 --> 2:07:17.260
 There was no possibility he was going to have consequences.

2:07:17.260 --> 2:07:22.380
 Kamala Harris, who was a cop, talked about when she was in college, she was smoking weed.

2:07:22.380 --> 2:07:27.740
 And it's like, I don't begrudge you guys smoking your crack or smoking your weed, but for other

2:07:27.740 --> 2:07:32.740
 people who are poor or maybe just had the short end of the stick, this is years of their

2:07:32.740 --> 2:07:35.180
 life being destroyed.

2:07:35.180 --> 2:07:37.880
 At the very least, even an arrest is a traumatic situation.

2:07:37.880 --> 2:07:42.580
 If you have a weed or cocaine or crack, you're arrested, that's really going to screw up,

2:07:42.580 --> 2:07:44.800
 it's going to do a number on you being locked up.

2:07:44.800 --> 2:07:48.780
 So to have that double standard to me is completely unacceptable.

2:07:48.780 --> 2:07:51.740
 And that has nothing to do with Republican or Democrat.

2:07:51.740 --> 2:07:55.220
 George W. Bush was a coke head back in the day.

2:07:55.220 --> 2:07:59.500
 He talks about overcoming his addiction, and I'm glad that he did, more power to him.

2:07:59.500 --> 2:08:04.100
 But just to have this kind of, you know, it's just really kind of disturbing to me, and

2:08:04.100 --> 2:08:07.980
 this is my anarchist brain, like how prevalent drug use is in college.

2:08:07.980 --> 2:08:11.020
 I think there's a joke on South Park, like, there's a time and a place to try drugs, and

2:08:11.020 --> 2:08:13.020
 that's called college where people experiment.

2:08:13.020 --> 2:08:17.100
 But all those college kids, which are going to become next generation's elite, don't really

2:08:17.100 --> 2:08:21.580
 have that worry that if they get caught, then anything's going to happen to them.

2:08:21.580 --> 2:08:25.620
 But that kid in the street who did not have that good upbringing, even if he's a piece

2:08:25.620 --> 2:08:30.780
 of crap, like he's not going to have a different punishment, I think that's just really at

2:08:30.780 --> 2:08:33.320
 his base on American.

2:08:33.320 --> 2:08:37.140
 So in contrast to Tolstoy, let me ask you about Emma Goldman.

2:08:37.140 --> 2:08:44.260
 You wrote that if anarchism believed in rulers, then Emma Goldman would be the undisputed

2:08:44.260 --> 2:08:45.260
 queen.

2:08:45.260 --> 2:08:46.260
 Yes.

2:08:46.260 --> 2:08:51.940
 What ideas defined her flavor of anarchism, would you say?

2:08:51.940 --> 2:08:56.420
 Emma was really an old school radical.

2:08:56.420 --> 2:08:58.800
 She was a radical among radicals.

2:08:58.800 --> 2:09:04.020
 I don't know what ideas, I mean, what would define her was anarchism, obviously.

2:09:04.020 --> 2:09:05.020
 There's the violence.

2:09:05.020 --> 2:09:11.340
 I mean, she was more open to the idea of violent opposition versus somebody like Tolstoy.

2:09:11.340 --> 2:09:12.620
 Oh, sure, for sure.

2:09:12.620 --> 2:09:17.340
 So basically, Emma and Alexander Berkman, their mentor was someone named Johann Most.

2:09:17.340 --> 2:09:22.540
 And Johann Most was a very early free speech, not very early, but he was a free speech concern

2:09:22.540 --> 2:09:26.900
 because he published a pamphlet in Europe that was translated in the States about how

2:09:26.900 --> 2:09:28.540
 to build dynamite.

2:09:28.540 --> 2:09:32.100
 Because his idea was, all right, you have this oppressive government, this oppressive

2:09:32.100 --> 2:09:36.380
 police force that use batons and bolts against us.

2:09:36.380 --> 2:09:40.860
 The only way for us as the working class to level the playing field is through dynamite

2:09:40.860 --> 2:09:42.440
 and here's how you build it.

2:09:42.440 --> 2:09:46.500
 So the question is, all right, is this something that could be allowed to be legal now that

2:09:46.500 --> 2:09:50.360
 you're allowing the layman to, in his own house, build bombs?

2:09:50.360 --> 2:09:56.560
 So Johann Most, basically, they had a big parting of ways because when Alexander Berkman

2:09:56.560 --> 2:10:02.880
 tried to assassinate Frick, Johann said, no, no, no, this is not something I'm for.

2:10:02.880 --> 2:10:07.540
 And in fact, they thought with this assassination, this failed assassination, this would be the

2:10:07.540 --> 2:10:11.540
 thing that's fired off the revolution because you had the strike, the Pinkertons involved,

2:10:11.540 --> 2:10:14.420
 Pinkertons getting killed, strikers are getting killed.

2:10:14.420 --> 2:10:18.060
 This is what Marx predicted, they're gonna light the spark and everything's gonna come

2:10:18.060 --> 2:10:19.060
 falling down.

2:10:19.060 --> 2:10:23.060
 He ends up going to jail for 13 years instead, Alexander Berkman does.

2:10:23.060 --> 2:10:28.780
 And then Goldman and Berkman had a big issue because when Leon Salgas killed McKinley

2:10:28.780 --> 2:10:32.640
 in 1901, it was really, it's kind of humorous in retrospect.

2:10:32.640 --> 2:10:34.740
 He gets arrested and they're like, why'd you kill the president?

2:10:34.740 --> 2:10:39.300
 He goes, I was radicalized by Emma Goldman and she's like, oh, damn it, she's on the

2:10:39.300 --> 2:10:40.300
 run.

2:10:40.300 --> 2:10:42.580
 I don't even know this guy.

2:10:42.580 --> 2:10:47.140
 And she made the point about like, why is it worse than the president being killed and

2:10:47.140 --> 2:10:48.140
 somebody else?

2:10:48.140 --> 2:10:49.260
 We're all equal.

2:10:49.260 --> 2:10:53.000
 And you would think if you're against capitalism, against the ruling class, this would be your

2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:54.120
 first target.

2:10:54.120 --> 2:11:01.320
 But Berkman, who went to jail, who tried to assassinate someone, he had said, McKinley,

2:11:01.320 --> 2:11:02.320
 this is your villain?

2:11:02.320 --> 2:11:03.540
 He's just a party hack.

2:11:03.540 --> 2:11:06.800
 He's like a symptom of the times, this is foolish.

2:11:06.800 --> 2:11:08.220
 And Goldman disagreed with him.

2:11:08.220 --> 2:11:14.800
 He thought it wasn't necessarily justified, but it may have done something that was defensible.

2:11:14.800 --> 2:11:19.280
 So the three of them, you know, had their differences on the use of violence.

2:11:19.280 --> 2:11:24.060
 And in fact, when she came back from Russia and was denouncing it in her book, My Disillusionment

2:11:24.060 --> 2:11:28.300
 in Russia, My First Disillusionment in Russia, the last chapter she goes, look, I'm not saying

2:11:28.300 --> 2:11:29.960
 I'm against violence.

2:11:29.960 --> 2:11:32.220
 When there's the revolution comes, we're going to have to use force.

2:11:32.220 --> 2:11:37.140
 She goes, but it's not the force of the state against the working class, against the masses.

2:11:37.140 --> 2:11:38.640
 This is exactly what we're opposed to.

2:11:38.640 --> 2:11:41.840
 This is a complete obscenity to our principles.

2:11:41.840 --> 2:11:43.320
 So that was interesting.

2:11:43.320 --> 2:11:49.920
 The fact that she was a, her periodical Mother Earth was a clearinghouse for many prominent,

2:11:49.920 --> 2:11:52.940
 you know, ideas of the day that weren't anarchist, but were certainly radical.

2:11:52.940 --> 2:11:55.880
 So she was a bit, and also she was like tiny, she was like 5.1.

2:11:55.880 --> 2:11:59.920
 So to have this little woman who was so feisty and...

2:11:59.920 --> 2:12:01.040
 Talk back to Lenin.

2:12:01.040 --> 2:12:02.040
 Talk back to Lenin.

2:12:02.040 --> 2:12:07.420
 She took on Lenin, Woodrow Wilson, J. Edgar Hoover was the one who deported her.

2:12:07.420 --> 2:12:08.420
 Someone who just...

2:12:08.420 --> 2:12:14.760
 And the thing is, you have to be careful because I think just like war, it's very easy to glamorize

2:12:14.760 --> 2:12:20.560
 violence and to regard it as something admirable or heroic, like you're fighting for the cause.

2:12:20.560 --> 2:12:24.600
 But if you take it out of the romanticism, you're like, you're killing someone who had

2:12:24.600 --> 2:12:25.600
 kids.

2:12:25.600 --> 2:12:27.280
 You are, you know, killing someone with a family.

2:12:27.280 --> 2:12:30.840
 You're making your, if you're going to shoot someone, they're probably going to retaliate

2:12:30.840 --> 2:12:32.340
 twice as hard.

2:12:32.340 --> 2:12:35.680
 Violence sings its own song and this is a very dangerous road you're going down.

2:12:35.680 --> 2:12:41.440
 So you really need to be careful about what you're preaching here.

2:12:41.440 --> 2:12:46.440
 And you know, she kind of had this mixed feelings about it, but that is certainly not Emma Goldman

2:12:46.440 --> 2:12:47.600
 her best.

2:12:47.600 --> 2:12:54.080
 Emma Goldman her best was about the ultimate freedom of the individual, of caring about

2:12:54.080 --> 2:12:59.120
 people who are desperately poor, who despised the corporate idea that we all had to be made

2:12:59.120 --> 2:13:04.120
 into cookie cutters and be interchangeable and all have to start work at the same time.

2:13:04.120 --> 2:13:08.260
 And basically our entire lives slave for corporation that have nothing to show for it while they

2:13:08.260 --> 2:13:13.400
 get wealthy and you have no opportunity for either productive work or creative work.

2:13:13.400 --> 2:13:19.320
 So that I think the valorization of kind of the lowest of the low is something I find

2:13:19.320 --> 2:13:20.360
 very admirable.

2:13:20.360 --> 2:13:24.600
 There's a quote of hers, which I think even for those of us who are, you know, for property

2:13:24.600 --> 2:13:30.760
 rights is left anarchism at its best, but she goes, go and ask for work.

2:13:30.760 --> 2:13:33.400
 If they don't give you work, ask for bread.

2:13:33.400 --> 2:13:35.280
 If they don't give you bread, take bread.

2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:38.800
 So the idea that like, if you're that poor and you're honestly trying to work and work

2:13:38.800 --> 2:13:43.680
 isn't available and you steal food to keep alive, that you shouldn't feel guilt about

2:13:43.680 --> 2:13:44.680
 it.

2:13:44.680 --> 2:13:46.080
 I don't know that I would disagree with that.

2:13:46.080 --> 2:13:50.580
 I think that there's something to be said at that point where it's just like, you know,

2:13:50.580 --> 2:13:54.680
 if property rights come between that and mass starvation, it's going to be very hard for

2:13:54.680 --> 2:13:56.280
 anyone to make the case for property rights.

2:13:56.280 --> 2:14:00.880
 Now, my argument is when you have free enterprise, food becomes so plentiful that now obesity

2:14:00.880 --> 2:14:01.920
 is an issue.

2:14:01.920 --> 2:14:06.360
 But at the time she did not have, of course, have that data to access.

2:14:06.360 --> 2:14:12.480
 Is there somebody you left out from the book that you thought about leaving in like some

2:14:12.480 --> 2:14:14.120
 interesting figures?

2:14:14.120 --> 2:14:15.960
 Yeah, there's a couple.

2:14:15.960 --> 2:14:22.760
 So Chomsky would have been one, of course, because he's probably one of the biggest anarchist

2:14:22.760 --> 2:14:26.040
 thinkers in contemporary times.

2:14:26.040 --> 2:14:30.080
 I was on the fence about Herbert Spencer because he's not an anarchist.

2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:32.120
 Chris Williamson's reading the chapter for the book.

2:14:32.120 --> 2:14:35.320
 He coined the term Survival of the Fittest and the chapter is called The Right to Ignore

2:14:35.320 --> 2:14:37.680
 the State from his book, Social Statics.

2:14:37.680 --> 2:14:42.400
 It was deleted from later editions, but people found it and reprinted it.

2:14:42.400 --> 2:14:47.320
 And Randolph Bourne, he was an early progressive.

2:14:47.320 --> 2:14:51.720
 He was the only one or one of the very few fighting against entering the Great War.

2:14:51.720 --> 2:14:55.700
 And he had an essay called War is the Health of the State, which is basically about how

2:14:55.700 --> 2:14:59.640
 states love war because it gives them an excuse to increase their power.

2:14:59.640 --> 2:15:03.220
 And it's very hard to argue against increasing state power in a time of war.

2:15:03.220 --> 2:15:07.280
 But since he was not himself an anarchist and there was plenty antiwar in there already,

2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:09.280
 I didn't include him, but those would be the ones.

2:15:09.280 --> 2:15:16.520
 Is there some people that you think the public would be surprised to learn that they are

2:15:16.520 --> 2:15:17.760
 at least in part anarchists?

2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:20.840
 Like I saw that Howard Zinn is supposedly an anarchist.

2:15:20.840 --> 2:15:25.480
 I mean, is there, like, just like Tolstoy is an anarchist.

2:15:25.480 --> 2:15:29.680
 Is there some people like that that you think in our modern life that would be surprised

2:15:29.680 --> 2:15:31.100
 to learn they're anarchists?

2:15:31.100 --> 2:15:34.200
 I can't think of any off the top of my head.

2:15:34.200 --> 2:15:38.520
 I mean, you could say Carl Hess, who was like Barry Goldwater's speechwriter from the 1964

2:15:38.520 --> 2:15:41.200
 campaign, but he's hardly a household name.

2:15:41.200 --> 2:15:48.160
 I mean, I think a lot of people would not ascribe to that term, but are certainly informed

2:15:48.160 --> 2:15:51.480
 with this complete distrust of all authority.

2:15:51.480 --> 2:15:54.740
 Murray Rothbard had an essay, if I didn't include anatomy of the state, I was going

2:15:54.740 --> 2:15:55.740
 to include this one.

2:15:55.740 --> 2:15:57.280
 It's much, much shorter.

2:15:57.280 --> 2:16:00.680
 And his question was, who are our allies and who are our enemies?

2:16:00.680 --> 2:16:04.880
 And the point he made is there's lots of people who would call themselves anarchists who are

2:16:04.880 --> 2:16:10.200
 of little use, whereas someone who is still like a minarchist or for government, but genuinely

2:16:10.200 --> 2:16:14.920
 hates the question Rothbard had is if there's a button and you could press that you would

2:16:14.920 --> 2:16:18.340
 end the state, would you press it so fast your finger would get a blister?

2:16:18.340 --> 2:16:22.100
 Those are allies, even if they're, you know, somewhat of a minarchist.

2:16:22.100 --> 2:16:26.100
 So I think that is kind of a better lens of looking at it.

2:16:26.100 --> 2:16:31.600
 And I don't think anyone needs to really ascribe to anarchism as a whole ideology in so far

2:16:31.600 --> 2:16:36.720
 as you're seeing right now, many people in certain fringe elements are just essentially

2:16:36.720 --> 2:16:42.680
 or are decreasingly fringe and increasing mainstream elements are realizing that this

2:16:42.680 --> 2:16:47.400
 idea that whatever the state does is somehow morally binding or legitimate is something

2:16:47.400 --> 2:16:50.080
 that at least bears strong questioning.

2:16:50.080 --> 2:16:51.080
 Sure.

2:16:51.080 --> 2:16:57.680
 And I mean, I guess there's a lot of groups like the libertarians, for example, have some

2:16:57.680 --> 2:16:58.680
 element of that.

2:16:58.680 --> 2:16:59.680
 Oh, sure.

2:16:59.680 --> 2:17:00.680
 For sure.

2:17:00.680 --> 2:17:02.780
 I mean, I think that's the beginning of the ways of government.

2:17:02.780 --> 2:17:07.820
 And also, I think what I love, I mean, if there's one issue where I would want people

2:17:07.820 --> 2:17:10.560
 to have this kind of analysis, it is war.

2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:13.780
 And it is like, okay, are you really sure?

2:17:13.780 --> 2:17:18.340
 Because this is 100% going to result in a lot of people being killed, a lot of people

2:17:18.340 --> 2:17:23.320
 being traumatized, a lot of people who are never going to recover, children, innocent

2:17:23.320 --> 2:17:24.320
 people.

2:17:24.320 --> 2:17:26.780
 Are you really sure this is the right thing to do?

2:17:26.780 --> 2:17:30.880
 And I think a lot of times if the answer is, well, it's the profitable thing to do.

2:17:30.880 --> 2:17:37.420
 And that is, I think, again, government at its absolute most venal and worst.

2:17:37.420 --> 2:17:40.960
 You Michael Malice in many ways are a New Yorker.

2:17:40.960 --> 2:17:41.960
 Oh, yes.

2:17:41.960 --> 2:17:43.480
 I'll give you one example.

2:17:43.480 --> 2:17:45.200
 I don't know where Austin is on the map.

2:17:45.200 --> 2:17:46.200
 No idea.

2:17:46.200 --> 2:17:47.200
 Not even kidding.

2:17:47.200 --> 2:17:48.200
 But does it even matter?

2:17:48.200 --> 2:17:50.120
 It doesn't matter.

2:17:50.120 --> 2:17:53.080
 But nevertheless, you've decided to move to Austin.

2:17:53.080 --> 2:17:54.080
 Yes.

2:17:54.080 --> 2:17:59.620
 Why do you think you're moving to Austin, or why do you moving both to Austin and away

2:17:59.620 --> 2:18:00.720
 from New York?

2:18:00.720 --> 2:18:05.640
 This was one of the both, I hate it when people talk like this, but I'm gonna do it anyway.

2:18:05.640 --> 2:18:08.920
 This was one of the hardest and easiest decisions of my life.

2:18:08.920 --> 2:18:13.440
 It was hard because I've lived in New York since I was two, other than college.

2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:14.700
 It's the only home I've known.

2:18:14.700 --> 2:18:16.160
 I know it intimately.

2:18:16.160 --> 2:18:17.520
 I know all the cool spots.

2:18:17.520 --> 2:18:20.920
 I love it with every fiber of my being or I did.

2:18:20.920 --> 2:18:25.360
 It was very much, you know, ingrained in my personality, my outlook about what cities

2:18:25.360 --> 2:18:29.760
 can be and can't be and should be and shouldn't be.

2:18:29.760 --> 2:18:31.560
 Deciding to move was not done.

2:18:31.560 --> 2:18:39.340
 But when you see your crew, your chosen family, one by one whittling away, it's not easy.

2:18:39.340 --> 2:18:40.340
 They all left.

2:18:40.340 --> 2:18:43.440
 There's just a couple of us left in New York.

2:18:43.440 --> 2:18:47.400
 And I don't see any mechanism by which New York is going to improve.

2:18:47.400 --> 2:18:49.440
 Things are getting much worse all the time.

2:18:49.440 --> 2:18:51.800
 It's just completely outrageous.

2:18:51.800 --> 2:18:54.500
 Here I would have a huge crew.

2:18:54.500 --> 2:18:57.480
 I didn't realize how much cheaper real estate is than in New York.

2:18:57.480 --> 2:18:58.480
 This is another way.

2:18:58.480 --> 2:19:01.520
 So New Yorkers are the most provincial people on earth who are completely oblivious to the

2:19:01.520 --> 2:19:02.680
 rest of the country.

2:19:02.680 --> 2:19:06.720
 So for a long time, the argument was New York versus LA, right, for certain types of people.

2:19:06.720 --> 2:19:08.920
 And they would say LA is cheaper in terms of rent.

2:19:08.920 --> 2:19:12.320
 So in New York, let's suppose the rent is a thousand, LA was 700, but you have to get

2:19:12.320 --> 2:19:13.320
 a car.

2:19:13.320 --> 2:19:14.520
 I'm like, this is kind of a wash.

2:19:14.520 --> 2:19:18.440
 So I assumed Austin would be like 80% of New York prices.

2:19:18.440 --> 2:19:23.360
 And I'm looking at these houses and for like 700,000, you could get a house here that would

2:19:23.360 --> 2:19:26.200
 cost like 3.5 million in New York.

2:19:26.200 --> 2:19:27.240
 And you could have a gun.

2:19:27.240 --> 2:19:30.840
 And it's just like, I could have a yard and I could have a dog and I could have a three

2:19:30.840 --> 2:19:35.680
 bedroom and I could have, you know, aquariums and my weird plants.

2:19:35.680 --> 2:19:44.160
 So to have all that, and it's just to have, I am very, very lucky that I have such a supportive

2:19:44.160 --> 2:19:45.160
 crew.

2:19:45.160 --> 2:19:49.520
 And they were also very smart because they sat me down and they said, whatever excuse

2:19:49.520 --> 2:19:53.880
 you have not to move here, we are going to make sure that doesn't count.

2:19:53.880 --> 2:19:59.400
 So my buddy Matt said, because I have a huge library, he goes, I will go to your house

2:19:59.400 --> 2:20:04.160
 and I will pack every single book you own myself so you can get that as an excuse the

2:20:04.160 --> 2:20:05.160
 other way.

2:20:05.160 --> 2:20:09.360
 I don't know how to drive and you do this, she's like, we're going to take driving lessons

2:20:09.360 --> 2:20:10.360
 together.

2:20:10.360 --> 2:20:12.320
 There goes that excuse.

2:20:12.320 --> 2:20:13.800
 How do I find an apartment?

2:20:13.800 --> 2:20:17.520
 They're like, we'll go to with the realtor and we'll take pictures for you.

2:20:17.520 --> 2:20:18.520
 We'll report back.

2:20:18.520 --> 2:20:19.520
 You can trust our judgment.

2:20:19.520 --> 2:20:20.520
 And I'm like, that's great.

2:20:20.520 --> 2:20:21.520
 I would do that.

2:20:21.520 --> 2:20:23.800
 That sounds like fun shopping for houses that have to buy them.

2:20:23.800 --> 2:20:29.640
 Then Matt just yesterday had the idea goes, come here, rent a furnished apartment for

2:20:29.640 --> 2:20:30.640
 a few months.

2:20:30.640 --> 2:20:32.480
 You don't have the pressure of buying.

2:20:32.480 --> 2:20:34.480
 And it's just, it's going to be an easy transition.

2:20:34.480 --> 2:20:36.640
 The rent's not going to be anything compared to New York.

2:20:36.640 --> 2:20:39.560
 I'm like, these are all very valid things.

2:20:39.560 --> 2:20:40.820
 You're here.

2:20:40.820 --> 2:20:41.820
 Lots of other people.

2:20:41.820 --> 2:20:43.920
 Yeah, that's what this is.

2:20:43.920 --> 2:20:47.000
 I made sure that's renting month to month.

2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:48.000
 Oh, this is rental.

2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:49.000
 This is rental.

2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:50.000
 Oh, you didn't realize this.

2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:51.000
 I thought you bought this.

2:20:51.000 --> 2:20:52.000
 No, no, no.

2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:53.000
 This is rental.

2:20:53.000 --> 2:20:54.000
 We can talk.

2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:55.000
 Why?

2:20:55.000 --> 2:20:56.000
 I thought you bought it.

2:20:56.000 --> 2:20:57.000
 No, it's rental.

2:20:57.000 --> 2:20:58.000
 Well, I really value freedom.

2:20:58.000 --> 2:20:59.000
 Yeah, of course.

2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:00.000
 Who are you talking to?

2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:05.440
 I've heard of this thing, freedom, it's really great.

2:21:05.440 --> 2:21:08.960
 But not everybody in the implementation of freedom is different for everybody.

2:21:08.960 --> 2:21:09.960
 Of course.

2:21:09.960 --> 2:21:14.280
 I don't want to make a statement about others.

2:21:14.280 --> 2:21:15.640
 I'll just speak for myself.

2:21:15.640 --> 2:21:22.880
 I think when you buy a house, that is not just a wise financial decision or all those

2:21:22.880 --> 2:21:26.340
 kinds of reasons that people have, investment, all those kinds of things.

2:21:26.340 --> 2:21:32.000
 I think it's also a hit on your freedom because the positive way to frame that is you make

2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:33.000
 it a home.

2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:34.000
 Yes.

2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:35.340
 You have a deep connection to it.

2:21:35.340 --> 2:21:39.360
 But the negative way to frame it is you're now a little bit stuck there.

2:21:39.360 --> 2:21:40.360
 Yeah.

2:21:40.360 --> 2:21:44.760
 And you may stay there way longer than you should when much better opportunities for

2:21:44.760 --> 2:21:46.960
 life come up.

2:21:46.960 --> 2:21:50.080
 There's stages in life when you're not sure exactly what the future will hold.

2:21:50.080 --> 2:21:54.640
 I would argue that's very often the case, basically at every stage in life.

2:21:54.640 --> 2:22:03.120
 I just want to make sure I maximize the freedom to embrace the most ambitious, the craziest,

2:22:03.120 --> 2:22:07.360
 the wildest, the most beautiful opportunities that come by.

2:22:07.360 --> 2:22:10.640
 You've actually brought this up too, because I said I really enjoyed the conversation with

2:22:10.640 --> 2:22:19.360
 you and Yaron, talking to you and somebody else, and I think you make a really significant

2:22:19.360 --> 2:22:20.360
 effort.

2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:26.040
 You've said this before, but it really is true and it stands in contrast to other folks

2:22:26.040 --> 2:22:27.360
 who are also good conversation.

2:22:27.360 --> 2:22:32.000
 You really make an effort for that person to meet the person.

2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:34.920
 Oh, for sure.

2:22:34.920 --> 2:22:45.280
 You made me realize it's kind of an art form, but it's also just, it's a thing worth doing

2:22:45.280 --> 2:22:51.000
 of putting in that effort and that leap of humanity to reach the, whether you're talking

2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:58.720
 to Dave Rubin or Alex Jones or Joe or me, just those are different human beings and

2:22:58.720 --> 2:22:59.720
 they're taking that leap.

2:22:59.720 --> 2:23:00.720
 It's fascinating.

2:23:00.720 --> 2:23:04.120
 I mean, do you have, how do you think about that?

2:23:04.120 --> 2:23:08.840
 I'm a huge introvert as you are, I think.

2:23:08.840 --> 2:23:18.040
 I feel very, very, very lucky that I get to get on a mic and run my mouth and for some

2:23:18.040 --> 2:23:20.080
 people, for some reason, people like this.

2:23:20.080 --> 2:23:27.960
 So I know what it's like to have a good convo and I know what it's like to have a bad convo.

2:23:27.960 --> 2:23:33.600
 So before I'll do a show, I will have like some things I would want to talk about.

2:23:33.600 --> 2:23:36.440
 And then I'll think about how to say them in an engaging way.

2:23:36.440 --> 2:23:38.200
 So I do my homework in that regard.

2:23:38.200 --> 2:23:45.320
 I'm also very good at, or I pride myself at taking people who are cerebral or intellectual

2:23:45.320 --> 2:23:49.760
 and making them a little bit silly, but also making them feel safe to be silly because

2:23:49.760 --> 2:23:55.120
 I'm not going to be making a buffoon of them that we're having fun as opposed to disrespecting

2:23:55.120 --> 2:23:56.120
 the person.

2:23:56.120 --> 2:24:00.040
 I think we all saw that with Yaron, who's very cerebral, very serious, but we were all

2:24:00.040 --> 2:24:05.480
 cracking jokes and he was having a good time and he knew even if I'm making fun of him

2:24:05.480 --> 2:24:09.800
 to his face, it is coming from a place of kindness and he's in on the joke and we're

2:24:09.800 --> 2:24:11.280
 all having fun.

2:24:11.280 --> 2:24:15.960
 That is something I try to do as much as possible.

2:24:15.960 --> 2:24:20.680
 I had an episode of my show a couple of weeks ago and someone who's been a friend of mine

2:24:20.680 --> 2:24:25.080
 for a long time and someone I admire a lot, Elizabeth Spires, she was the founding member

2:24:25.080 --> 2:24:31.320
 of, founding editor of Gawker, she's worked for the Observer for Jared Kushner, her resume

2:24:31.320 --> 2:24:37.280
 second to none and she was on my show and she was talking, her politics are pretty straightforward

2:24:37.280 --> 2:24:41.920
 like corporate journalist, blue pilled politics and my audience was very upset that I wasn't

2:24:41.920 --> 2:24:43.320
 pushing back or whatever.

2:24:43.320 --> 2:24:48.520
 I'm like, my job, if someone is coming to a place where the audience is at least going

2:24:48.520 --> 2:24:54.740
 to be somewhat hostile, is not to make her have negative consequences for doing something

2:24:54.740 --> 2:24:56.140
 that she didn't need to do.

2:24:56.140 --> 2:25:02.080
 My job is to make sure that the experience is a positive one for her as the host.

2:25:02.080 --> 2:25:07.500
 So when I'm the guest, I always feel that my job is to make the host look good and make

2:25:07.500 --> 2:25:11.500
 the host not feel like it's work and the audience really likes that because instead of it being

2:25:11.500 --> 2:25:16.640
 an interview or intense, it is a conversation, nine of us know what's going to happen and

2:25:16.640 --> 2:25:21.640
 so this is something I think about a fair amount and I try to apply and insofar as it's

2:25:21.640 --> 2:25:26.240
 successful, I'm delighted and there's times when it's not successful and that's a shame

2:25:26.240 --> 2:25:28.760
 but all we could do is do our best.

2:25:28.760 --> 2:25:30.600
 Yeah, I really enjoyed that conversation with her.

2:25:30.600 --> 2:25:34.320
 I was surprised by the dislikes and all that kind of stuff.

2:25:34.320 --> 2:25:38.800
 Well, one of the things I always talk about is I don't care what my friends politics are.

2:25:38.800 --> 2:25:43.120
 I care about if I'm having a bad day, can I call them up and ask for advice and Elizabeth

2:25:43.120 --> 2:25:47.680
 has been there for me in the past and then when I do it on a camera in front of mics,

2:25:47.680 --> 2:25:48.680
 people freaking out.

2:25:48.680 --> 2:25:51.160
 I'm like, I'm practicing what I preach.

2:25:51.160 --> 2:25:57.240
 My, the relationships are more important than someone's political views and it's not hypocrisy

2:25:57.240 --> 2:26:01.260
 at all to demonstrate that and not to push back.

2:26:01.260 --> 2:26:02.600
 And there was great humor there.

2:26:02.600 --> 2:26:07.600
 You're both a bit of trolls in very different ways but nevertheless, that connection, the

2:26:07.600 --> 2:26:14.400
 humor and the mutual respect and love that was all there, yeah, it's just fascinating.

2:26:14.400 --> 2:26:16.520
 You've talked to Alex Jones a couple days ago.

2:26:16.520 --> 2:26:17.520
 Sure, yeah.

2:26:17.520 --> 2:26:21.200
 I haven't seen him many times before but you've had him on your podcast.

2:26:21.200 --> 2:26:22.200
 This week, yeah.

2:26:22.200 --> 2:26:23.200
 This week.

2:26:23.200 --> 2:26:31.880
 I was kind of surprised that he mentioned that human animal hybrids was like the number,

2:26:31.880 --> 2:26:38.840
 the main conspiracy that people should look into to open their eyes to the, you know,

2:26:38.840 --> 2:26:42.560
 to all this, to the globalists, to all the conspiracies that are out there.

2:26:42.560 --> 2:26:44.520
 Was that surprising to you?

2:26:44.520 --> 2:26:51.320
 No, because I came in there with questions and I was very focused on corralling him and

2:26:51.320 --> 2:26:54.120
 having it be like kind of a coherent intellectual conversation.

2:26:54.120 --> 2:26:58.120
 That was a really, really good, it was only an hour but it was a very good conversation.

2:26:58.120 --> 2:26:59.120
 Yeah, thank you.

2:26:59.120 --> 2:27:04.280
 I, the response was overwhelmingly positive and I'm like, all right, I'm in a unique position

2:27:04.280 --> 2:27:08.800
 because Alex, I met Alex, well, that's not true, but I was on Alex, with Alex on Tim

2:27:08.800 --> 2:27:10.320
 Pool a couple of times.

2:27:10.320 --> 2:27:14.160
 It was mayhem, it was anarchy and I'm like, all right, let me get.

2:27:14.160 --> 2:27:18.040
 But the thing is what people enjoyed is I was the one who was basically able to translate

2:27:18.040 --> 2:27:19.040
 Alex's ease.

2:27:19.040 --> 2:27:23.360
 He's obviously very performative and a lot of times Alex will say things that are not

2:27:23.360 --> 2:27:29.200
 really particularly controversial, but he'll say them in such a way that it sounds crazier

2:27:29.200 --> 2:27:30.200
 than it is.

2:27:30.200 --> 2:27:32.440
 You know, I think Joe's made this observation as well.

2:27:32.440 --> 2:27:38.720
 So what I wanted to have him on my show is, all right, let's go through all these conspiracies

2:27:38.720 --> 2:27:40.800
 which have validity, which don't.

2:27:40.800 --> 2:27:43.920
 And I knew if I asked him, because he's got a lot of historical knowledge, even if you

2:27:43.920 --> 2:27:49.040
 think of a lot of it's nonsensical, let's sort out the wheat from the chaff, you know,

2:27:49.040 --> 2:27:50.680
 because everyone has someone crazy in them.

2:27:50.680 --> 2:27:54.960
 I have this expression, you take one red pill, not the whole bottle, you take the whole bottle

2:27:54.960 --> 2:27:59.120
 of red pills, you assume literally everything in the media is a lie, that's just not a coherent

2:27:59.120 --> 2:28:00.120
 position to have.

2:28:00.120 --> 2:28:03.060
 Is the weather a lie when they tell you that temperature is going to be wrong tomorrow?

2:28:03.060 --> 2:28:05.400
 So that was fun to watch him go through that.

2:28:05.400 --> 2:28:10.820
 And he felt bad because he felt incorrectly, in my opinion, that he was needlessly aggressive

2:28:10.820 --> 2:28:12.320
 and disrespectful toward me on Tim.

2:28:12.320 --> 2:28:13.640
 I didn't feel disrespected at all.

2:28:13.640 --> 2:28:15.760
 It got heated, but I didn't take it personally.

2:28:15.760 --> 2:28:17.360
 People have heated debates all the time.

2:28:17.360 --> 2:28:21.640
 So I think he promised me he wouldn't interrupt and would be deferential, but that because

2:28:21.640 --> 2:28:27.480
 he promised to be on his best behavior, that gave me an opportunity to address him seriously

2:28:27.480 --> 2:28:32.200
 and not to bring the clown aspect out of him, which is easy to caricature him.

2:28:32.200 --> 2:28:36.000
 My friend Ethan Suppley, who I'm sure people know, played basically a character based on

2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:40.320
 him in The Hunt, because Alex is kind of this cartoon archetype.

2:28:40.320 --> 2:28:45.680
 So it was really fun to get another side of him.

2:28:45.680 --> 2:28:49.080
 And also, it's just fun being on his show, just him being bombastic and just trying to

2:28:49.080 --> 2:28:51.040
 be the calm voice of reason.

2:28:51.040 --> 2:28:52.800
 And for once, the trickster was Apollo.

2:28:52.800 --> 2:28:57.000
 Well, I like this thing he said before.

2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:03.520
 And that's what makes me the most interested in Alex is the Nietzsche quote about gazing

2:29:03.520 --> 2:29:04.920
 into the abyss.

2:29:04.920 --> 2:29:08.980
 I think he said on your show that he has become the abyss or something like that.

2:29:08.980 --> 2:29:14.840
 I think that makes him fascinating that when you really take conspiracy theories seriously,

2:29:14.840 --> 2:29:17.840
 the kind of effect it has on your mind.

2:29:17.840 --> 2:29:18.840
 That to me is fascinating.

2:29:18.840 --> 2:29:22.140
 Well, can I say one thing, that term conspiracy theory?

2:29:22.140 --> 2:29:26.480
 If you ask any layman, look, it's like this, you say, do you like puppies?

2:29:26.480 --> 2:29:27.480
 I hate them.

2:29:27.480 --> 2:29:28.480
 Do you like baby dogs?

2:29:28.480 --> 2:29:29.480
 Oh, they're the best, right?

2:29:29.480 --> 2:29:31.960
 People, the human mind is capable of doing this.

2:29:31.960 --> 2:29:38.640
 So if you ask people, do you think extremely powerful people often get together and manipulate

2:29:38.640 --> 2:29:43.160
 data or rules in order to further their power and control and maintain it?

2:29:43.160 --> 2:29:46.380
 I think 90 plus percent of people would be like, of course.

2:29:46.380 --> 2:29:48.200
 Then you say, oh, so you believe in conspiracy theories.

2:29:48.200 --> 2:29:49.760
 Oh no, that's for crazy people.

2:29:49.760 --> 2:29:51.440
 Those concepts are identical.

2:29:51.440 --> 2:29:58.120
 Now that term is used for people who are like, all right, there's conspiracies in government

2:29:58.120 --> 2:30:00.040
 to experiment on people like Tuskegee.

2:30:00.040 --> 2:30:01.040
 This is not in dispute.

2:30:01.040 --> 2:30:05.480
 The CIA has unsealed things, Operation Mockingbird, so on and so forth.

2:30:05.480 --> 2:30:09.700
 And at the same time, conspiracy theory applies to people who say 9 11 never happened and

2:30:09.700 --> 2:30:11.040
 those are holograms.

2:30:11.040 --> 2:30:16.240
 Now it's the same word for both, but these are not at all equal truth claims and they

2:30:16.240 --> 2:30:18.360
 do not at all have equal evidence to them.

2:30:18.360 --> 2:30:22.840
 But it's very useful for powerful people to have that term in the zeitgeist because then

2:30:22.840 --> 2:30:24.400
 I don't have to explain or defend.

2:30:24.400 --> 2:30:27.560
 It's like, only lunatics are going to look further on this.

2:30:27.560 --> 2:30:29.440
 Do you really want to be a lunatic kid?

2:30:29.440 --> 2:30:31.400
 And that takes care of the issue.

2:30:31.400 --> 2:30:35.720
 Unfortunately the same problem applies, language applies to a lot of other areas.

2:30:35.720 --> 2:30:37.800
 100%, that's the nature of language, yeah.

2:30:37.800 --> 2:30:39.880
 It's used not just to communicate, but to obfuscate.

2:30:39.880 --> 2:30:46.320
 Obviously that could be fixed by coming up with different words to label conspiracy theories

2:30:46.320 --> 2:30:48.720
 that are much more likely to be true.

2:30:48.720 --> 2:30:53.720
 Yeah, like power elite analysis is another, is basically conspiracy theory.

2:30:53.720 --> 2:30:59.200
 This is the black pill versus white pill question with the abyss.

2:30:59.200 --> 2:31:06.780
 Do you think thinking about these things can destroy the mind, can make you deeply cynical

2:31:06.780 --> 2:31:08.280
 about the world?

2:31:08.280 --> 2:31:15.320
 Yeah, because if you are thinking that you are not aware of, or no one is aware of who's

2:31:15.320 --> 2:31:20.520
 controlling things and that the level of their control, it gives you the sense of powerlessness

2:31:20.520 --> 2:31:22.160
 and hopelessness.

2:31:22.160 --> 2:31:27.520
 And my counter is the people in charge, one of the reasons I'm an anarchist, are nowhere

2:31:27.520 --> 2:31:30.360
 near as smart and crafty as you think they are.

2:31:30.360 --> 2:31:34.320
 And certainly maybe the ones complete in the shadow maybe are, but the ones who are in

2:31:34.320 --> 2:31:38.240
 the public face most certainly are not, as social media has demonstrated, when you look

2:31:38.240 --> 2:31:45.200
 at how senators and Harvard professors tweet, these are not, you know, intellects that you're

2:31:45.200 --> 2:31:47.320
 in awe of, to put it mildly.

2:31:47.320 --> 2:31:52.680
 So I think that kind of takes the bloom off the rose to a great extent.

2:31:52.680 --> 2:31:57.480
 You mentioned that you've been doing a lot of amazing things, been truly joyful recently.

2:31:57.480 --> 2:32:02.400
 But I don't know if you have a bucket list.

2:32:02.400 --> 2:32:05.800
 Is there items on the bucket list you haven't done yet?

2:32:05.800 --> 2:32:11.440
 Are you pretty much satisfied and happy, and if you die today, if I murder you, you'll

2:32:11.440 --> 2:32:12.440
 be happy?

2:32:12.440 --> 2:32:13.440
 I could die today.

2:32:13.440 --> 2:32:17.840
 Is there an item on the bucket list you want to get done?

2:32:17.840 --> 2:32:20.000
 I don't, yeah.

2:32:20.000 --> 2:32:21.000
 Deep Sea submersible.

2:32:21.000 --> 2:32:24.640
 That would be number one on the bucket list.

2:32:24.640 --> 2:32:25.640
 Why?

2:32:25.640 --> 2:32:28.600
 Because that's where all the most interesting zoology is.

2:32:28.600 --> 2:32:35.720
 And to be in a place where like virtually no human being has been, and to see these

2:32:35.720 --> 2:32:38.720
 gods mistakes and their natural environment.

2:32:38.720 --> 2:32:40.600
 My friend coined that term gods mistakes.

2:32:40.600 --> 2:32:44.480
 If you look at deep sea creatures, you can imagine god making some animal being like,

2:32:44.480 --> 2:32:48.200
 oh god, this is hideous, I'll just throw them on the ocean, no one's gonna see this.

2:32:48.200 --> 2:32:51.040
 So that would be my number one bucket list thing.

2:32:51.040 --> 2:32:55.800
 I would say go to the White House as a guest would be a bucket list thing.

2:32:55.800 --> 2:32:59.600
 Russia, go to Russia would be a bucket list thing.

2:32:59.600 --> 2:33:04.000
 I want to go, these are secondary, like go to Eritrea would be a bucket list thing.

2:33:04.000 --> 2:33:06.600
 I've got a long list of books I need to write.

2:33:06.600 --> 2:33:12.680
 That's that's, I don't know if that's really a bucket list per se.

2:33:12.680 --> 2:33:18.520
 There's not that much, what I'm at a point in my life is once you cross up certain things,

2:33:18.520 --> 2:33:21.800
 you basically, instead of driving the car, start surfing.

2:33:21.800 --> 2:33:25.880
 And just amazing thing, I talked to you about this medical thing, you know, before we started.

2:33:25.880 --> 2:33:29.120
 At a certain point, and I'm sure this happens to you, because your platform is a lot bigger

2:33:29.120 --> 2:33:32.760
 than mine, all sorts of things start coming your way that you never would have thought

2:33:32.760 --> 2:33:33.760
 of.

2:33:33.760 --> 2:33:35.440
 And you're like, this is pretty darn cool.

2:33:35.440 --> 2:33:38.560
 So to be, and that's happening at an escalating rate.

2:33:38.560 --> 2:33:43.100
 Like I'm at a point now where I get stopped every day by people.

2:33:43.100 --> 2:33:47.720
 So that's going to be a weird thing for me to get adjusted to.

2:33:47.720 --> 2:33:53.160
 Like without exception, everyone who has ever stopped me on the street has been cool.

2:33:53.160 --> 2:33:54.840
 And it's been a pleasant experience.

2:33:54.840 --> 2:33:58.880
 There was one exception at an event where someone was genuinely on the spectrum and

2:33:58.880 --> 2:34:02.680
 they didn't understand like distance and you don't touch people and that, but that's as

2:34:02.680 --> 2:34:04.200
 bad as it got.

2:34:04.200 --> 2:34:09.400
 So that is something that's going to be weird for me to have to deal with over the next

2:34:09.400 --> 2:34:10.400
 couple of years.

2:34:10.400 --> 2:34:14.440
 But you know, it's the price you pay and it's hardly a small price when people come up to

2:34:14.440 --> 2:34:16.320
 you and say you've made my life better.

2:34:16.320 --> 2:34:20.380
 But it's just weird when you go and like, like I was at the gym and then someone tweets

2:34:20.380 --> 2:34:22.600
 like, did I see you at the gym just now?

2:34:22.600 --> 2:34:24.000
 It's kind of weird.

2:34:24.000 --> 2:34:27.920
 And I'm sure it's the same for you when you're walking around and you don't think about it,

2:34:27.920 --> 2:34:30.880
 but people know who you are and you don't know who they are that you're being watched.

2:34:30.880 --> 2:34:34.880
 Even though it's not malevolent, it's still just, you don't get prepared for that.

2:34:34.880 --> 2:34:42.200
 Michael, there were, there will be two really big names that wanted to do this podcast.

2:34:42.200 --> 2:34:46.060
 We'll do this podcast that I considered to do episode 200 with.

2:34:46.060 --> 2:34:54.840
 But then I realized why the hell talk to somebody famous when I could talk to somebody I love

2:34:54.840 --> 2:34:56.840
 that nobody knows or cares for.

2:34:56.840 --> 2:35:00.680
 You just hit a random number generator.

2:35:00.680 --> 2:35:01.680
 Yeah.

2:35:01.680 --> 2:35:04.800
 Just, I listed all the Russians I know and who is the easiest to get.

2:35:04.800 --> 2:35:05.800
 You're the.

2:35:05.800 --> 2:35:07.800
 Yeah, who's the most desperate for camera stuff.

2:35:07.800 --> 2:35:12.600
 He's got a shitty book out, we can talk about that for five minutes.

2:35:12.600 --> 2:35:15.120
 This garbage cut and paste that he did.

2:35:15.120 --> 2:35:20.640
 Uh, it turned out okay, I think slightly above average.

2:35:20.640 --> 2:35:22.560
 Michael, I love you.

2:35:22.560 --> 2:35:24.040
 You're an incredible human being.

2:35:24.040 --> 2:35:26.800
 It's an honor that you would talk to me and you'll be my friend.

2:35:26.800 --> 2:35:27.800
 Thanks so much for doing this.

2:35:27.800 --> 2:35:34.500
 Uh, the respect that I got, uh, when you asked me to be the guest for the anniversary episode

2:35:34.500 --> 2:35:38.520
 was similar to the respect when my two friends, Josh and Zoe, they were going to get married

2:35:38.520 --> 2:35:41.840
 at city hall and they said, we want someone to witness at the Basque.

2:35:41.840 --> 2:35:46.680
 So it's one thing when people tell you they like you and respect you, which I had growing

2:35:46.680 --> 2:35:47.680
 up.

2:35:47.680 --> 2:35:48.680
 It's another thing when they show it.

2:35:48.680 --> 2:35:51.960
 And this is something that I do not take lightly and I hope no one takes lightly.

2:35:51.960 --> 2:35:56.360
 And if someone does right by you and shows you respect, going back to kind of taking

2:35:56.360 --> 2:36:01.840
 out for dinner, thank them, buy them a candy bar, buy them a soda, do something to show

2:36:01.840 --> 2:36:03.840
 that you don't take it for granted.

2:36:03.840 --> 2:36:09.960
 Because I think what you and I both want to do is increase human kindness as much as possible.

2:36:09.960 --> 2:36:16.040
 And I'm going to look at the camera, be kind to yourself, because a lot of you deserve

2:36:16.040 --> 2:36:17.040
 it.

2:36:17.040 --> 2:36:23.880
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Michael Malice and thank you to Gala

2:36:23.880 --> 2:36:27.760
 Games, Indeed, BetterHelp and Masterclass.

2:36:27.760 --> 2:36:31.480
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:36:31.480 --> 2:36:37.160
 And now let me leave you with some words from Jack Kerouac that perhaps begins to explain

2:36:37.160 --> 2:36:42.400
 the nature of and the reasons for my friendship with Mr. Michael Malice.

2:36:42.400 --> 2:36:47.880
 The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad

2:36:47.880 --> 2:36:53.160
 to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say

2:36:53.160 --> 2:37:00.400
 commonplace thing but burn, burn, like fabulous yellow Roman candles exploding like spiders

2:37:00.400 --> 2:37:05.920
 across the stars and in the middle you see the blue center light pop and everybody goes

2:37:05.920 --> 2:37:09.120
 ahhhhh.

2:37:09.120 --> 2:37:36.200
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
