00:00.000 --> 00:03.160
 The following is a conversation with Scott Aaronson,

00:03.160 --> 00:04.920
 a professor at UT Austin,

00:04.920 --> 00:07.200
 director of its Quantum Information Center,

00:07.200 --> 00:10.000
 and previously a professor at MIT.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.720
 His research interests center

00:11.720 --> 00:14.580
 around the capabilities and limits of quantum computers

00:14.580 --> 00:17.720
 and computational complexity theory more generally.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.440
 He is an excellent writer

00:19.440 --> 00:21.100
 and one of my favorite communicators

00:21.100 --> 00:23.300
 of computer science in the world.

00:23.300 --> 00:26.480
 We only had about an hour and a half of this conversation,

00:26.480 --> 00:29.160
 so I decided to focus on quantum computing.

00:29.160 --> 00:30.920
 But I can see us talking again in the future

00:30.920 --> 00:33.240
 on this podcast at some point

00:33.240 --> 00:35.640
 about computational complexity theory

00:35.640 --> 00:38.480
 and all the complexity classes that Scott catalogs

00:38.480 --> 00:41.100
 in his amazing Complexity Zoo Wiki.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.640
 As a quick aside,

00:43.640 --> 00:46.020
 based on questions and comments I've received,

00:46.020 --> 00:48.200
 my goal with these conversations

00:48.200 --> 00:51.560
 is to try to be in the background without ego

00:51.560 --> 00:53.400
 and do three things.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.240
 One, let the guests shine

00:55.240 --> 00:56.960
 and try to discover together

00:56.960 --> 00:59.080
 the most beautiful insights in their work

00:59.080 --> 01:00.760
 and in their mind.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.960
 Two, try to play devil's advocate

01:02.960 --> 01:05.560
 just enough to provide a creative tension

01:05.560 --> 01:08.040
 in exploring ideas through conversation.

01:08.040 --> 01:11.760
 And three, to ask very basic questions

01:11.760 --> 01:15.300
 about terminology, about concepts, about ideas.

01:16.360 --> 01:18.760
 Many of the topics we talk about in the podcast

01:18.760 --> 01:20.600
 I've been studying for years

01:20.600 --> 01:22.800
 as a grad student, as a researcher,

01:22.800 --> 01:26.180
 and generally as a curious human who loves to read.

01:26.180 --> 01:29.180
 But frankly, I see myself in these conversations

01:29.180 --> 01:30.360
 as the main character

01:30.360 --> 01:32.720
 for one of my favorite novels by Dostoevsky

01:32.720 --> 01:35.160
 called The Idiot.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.920
 I enjoy playing dumb.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.080
 Clearly, it comes naturally.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.200
 But the basic questions

01:40.200 --> 01:42.440
 don't come from my ignorance of the subject

01:42.440 --> 01:45.800
 but from an instinct that the fundamentals are simple.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.060
 And if we linger on them

01:47.060 --> 01:49.020
 from almost a naive perspective,

01:49.020 --> 01:50.920
 we can draw an insightful thread

01:50.920 --> 01:53.400
 from computer science to neuroscience

01:53.400 --> 01:55.320
 to physics to philosophy

01:55.320 --> 01:57.920
 and to artificial intelligence.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.480
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.680
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

02:03.680 --> 02:05.660
 give it five stars on Apple Podcast,

02:05.660 --> 02:07.000
 support it on Patreon,

02:07.000 --> 02:08.960
 or simply connect with me on Twitter

02:08.960 --> 02:13.540
 at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

02:13.540 --> 02:16.440
 As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now

02:16.440 --> 02:17.880
 and never any ads in the middle

02:17.880 --> 02:20.120
 that can break the flow of the conversation.

02:20.120 --> 02:21.520
 I hope that works for you

02:21.520 --> 02:24.100
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.560
 Quick summary of the ads.

02:25.560 --> 02:27.080
 Two supporters today.

02:27.080 --> 02:31.640
 First, get Cash App and use the code LEX PODCAST.

02:31.640 --> 02:35.040
 Second, listen to the Tech Meme Ride Home podcast

02:35.040 --> 02:36.300
 for tech news.

02:36.300 --> 02:40.420
 Search Ride Home, two words, in your podcast app.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.440
 This show is presented by Cash App,

02:43.440 --> 02:45.860
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

02:45.860 --> 02:49.320
 When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST.

02:49.320 --> 02:51.600
 Cash App lets you send money to friends,

02:51.600 --> 02:54.120
 buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market

02:54.120 --> 02:56.000
 with as little as one dollar.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.040
 Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,

02:59.040 --> 03:03.040
 a subsidiary of Square, a member SIPC.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.360
 Since Cash App does fractional share trading,

03:05.360 --> 03:08.200
 let me mention that the order execution algorithm

03:08.200 --> 03:09.760
 that works behind the scenes

03:09.760 --> 03:12.520
 to create the abstraction of fractional orders

03:12.520 --> 03:14.640
 is an algorithmic marvel.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.940
 So big props to the Cash App engineers

03:16.940 --> 03:19.440
 for solving a hard problem that in the end

03:19.440 --> 03:22.260
 provides an easy interface that takes a step up

03:22.260 --> 03:25.140
 to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market,

03:25.140 --> 03:28.480
 making trading more accessible for new investors

03:28.480 --> 03:31.720
 and diversification much easier.

03:31.720 --> 03:34.400
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store

03:34.400 --> 03:37.880
 or Google Play and use the code LEX PODCAST,

03:37.880 --> 03:42.080
 you'll get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,

03:42.080 --> 03:44.120
 one of my favorite organizations

03:44.120 --> 03:47.360
 that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education

03:47.360 --> 03:49.600
 for young people around the world.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.200
 This episode is also supported

03:52.200 --> 03:55.720
 by the Tech Meme Ride Home Podcast.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.760
 It's a technology podcast I've been listening to

03:57.760 --> 04:00.280
 for a while and really enjoying.

04:00.280 --> 04:01.720
 It goes straight to the point,

04:01.720 --> 04:03.680
 gives you the tech news you need to know

04:03.680 --> 04:07.080
 and provides minimal but essential context.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.080
 It's released every day by 5 p.m. Eastern

04:10.080 --> 04:12.600
 and is only about 15 to 20 minutes long.

04:13.460 --> 04:16.240
 For fun, I like building apps on smartphones,

04:16.240 --> 04:18.800
 most on Android, so I'm always a little curious

04:18.800 --> 04:21.120
 about new flagship phones that come out.

04:21.120 --> 04:25.600
 I saw that Samsung announced the new Galaxy S20

04:25.600 --> 04:29.360
 and of course, right away, Tech Meme Ride Home

04:29.360 --> 04:33.200
 has a new episode that summarizes all that I needed to know

04:33.200 --> 04:35.520
 about this new device.

04:35.520 --> 04:38.560
 They've also started to do weekend bonus episodes

04:38.560 --> 04:42.020
 with interviews of people like AWOL founder Steve Case

04:42.020 --> 04:45.600
 on investing and Gary Marcus on AI,

04:45.600 --> 04:48.680
 who I've also interviewed on this podcast.

04:48.680 --> 04:51.600
 You can find the Tech Meme Ride Home Podcast

04:51.600 --> 04:56.600
 if you search your podcast app for Ride Home, two words.

04:56.680 --> 05:00.160
 Then subscribe, enjoy, and keep up to date

05:00.160 --> 05:02.560
 with the latest tech news.

05:02.560 --> 05:06.660
 And now, here's my conversation with Scott Aaronson.

05:07.680 --> 05:11.640
 I sometimes get criticism from a listener here and there

05:11.640 --> 05:13.400
 that while having a conversation

05:13.400 --> 05:16.200
 with a world class mathematician, physicist,

05:16.200 --> 05:18.200
 neurobiologist, aerospace engineer,

05:18.200 --> 05:21.740
 or a theoretical computer scientist like yourself,

05:21.740 --> 05:24.680
 I waste time by asking philosophical questions

05:24.680 --> 05:28.880
 about free will, consciousness, mortality, love,

05:28.880 --> 05:31.920
 nature of truth, super intelligence,

05:31.920 --> 05:33.480
 whether time travel is possible,

05:33.480 --> 05:35.960
 whether space time is emergent and fundamental,

05:36.840 --> 05:39.400
 even the crazier questions like whether aliens exist,

05:39.400 --> 05:40.840
 what their language might look like,

05:40.840 --> 05:43.020
 what their math might look like,

05:43.020 --> 05:44.700
 whether math is invented or discovered,

05:44.700 --> 05:47.960
 and of course, whether we live in a simulation or not.

05:47.960 --> 05:48.800
 So I try.

05:48.800 --> 05:49.880
 Out with it.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.360
 Out with it.

05:51.360 --> 05:55.460
 I try to dance back and forth from the deep technical

05:55.460 --> 05:59.040
 to the philosophical, so I've done that quite a bit.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.680
 So you're a world class computer scientist,

06:01.680 --> 06:04.120
 and yet you've written about this very point,

06:04.120 --> 06:06.720
 the philosophy is important for experts

06:06.720 --> 06:09.040
 in any technical discipline,

06:09.040 --> 06:11.140
 though they somehow seem to avoid this.

06:11.140 --> 06:13.460
 So I thought it'd be really interesting

06:13.460 --> 06:15.100
 to talk to you about this point.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.740
 Why should we computer scientists, mathematicians,

06:17.740 --> 06:20.780
 physicists care about philosophy, do you think?

06:20.780 --> 06:23.020
 Well, I would reframe the question a little bit.

06:23.020 --> 06:26.760
 I mean, philosophy almost by definition

06:26.760 --> 06:30.940
 is the subject that's concerned with the biggest questions

06:30.940 --> 06:33.160
 that you could possibly ask, right?

06:33.160 --> 06:35.740
 So the ones you mentioned, right?

06:35.740 --> 06:38.440
 Are we living in a simulation?

06:38.440 --> 06:41.720
 Are we alone in the universe?

06:41.720 --> 06:44.360
 How should we even think about such questions?

06:44.360 --> 06:46.000
 Is the future determined,

06:46.000 --> 06:49.560
 and what do we even mean by it being determined?

06:49.560 --> 06:51.760
 Why are we alive at the time we are

06:51.760 --> 06:53.200
 and not at some other time?

06:55.320 --> 06:58.020
 And when you sort of contemplate

06:58.020 --> 06:59.560
 the enormity of those questions,

06:59.560 --> 07:01.080
 I think you could ask,

07:01.080 --> 07:04.560
 well, then why be concerned with anything else, right?

07:04.560 --> 07:08.760
 Why not spend your whole life on those questions?

07:08.760 --> 07:10.120
 I think in some sense,

07:10.120 --> 07:13.800
 that is the right way to phrase the question.

07:13.800 --> 07:18.800
 And actually, what we learned, I mean, throughout history,

07:19.240 --> 07:21.920
 but really starting with the scientific revolution

07:21.920 --> 07:24.000
 with Galileo and so on,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.840
 is that there is a good reason to focus

07:26.840 --> 07:31.320
 on narrower questions, more technical,

07:31.320 --> 07:33.600
 mathematical or empirical questions.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.520
 And that is that you can actually make progress on them,

07:36.520 --> 07:39.260
 and you can actually often answer them.

07:39.260 --> 07:41.760
 And sometimes they actually tell you something

07:41.760 --> 07:43.820
 about the philosophical questions

07:43.820 --> 07:48.500
 that sort of maybe motivated your curiosity as a child.

07:48.500 --> 07:51.760
 They don't necessarily resolve the philosophical questions,

07:51.760 --> 07:53.300
 but sometimes they reframe

07:53.300 --> 07:55.120
 your whole understanding of them, right?

07:55.120 --> 07:58.120
 And so for me, philosophy is just the thing

07:58.120 --> 08:00.920
 that you have in the background from the very beginning

08:00.920 --> 08:05.480
 that you want to, these are sort of the reasons

08:05.480 --> 08:08.640
 why you went into intellectual life in the first place,

08:08.640 --> 08:10.620
 at least the reasons why I did, right?

08:11.720 --> 08:15.200
 But math and science are tools that we have

08:15.200 --> 08:17.540
 for actually making progress.

08:17.540 --> 08:21.480
 And hopefully even changing our understanding

08:21.480 --> 08:23.280
 of these philosophical questions,

08:23.280 --> 08:26.400
 sometimes even more than philosophy itself does.

08:26.400 --> 08:30.560
 Why do you think computer scientists avoid these questions?

08:30.560 --> 08:31.880
 We'll run away from them a little bit,

08:31.880 --> 08:34.600
 at least in a technical scientific discourse.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.000
 Well, I'm not sure if they do so

08:37.000 --> 08:39.200
 more than any other scientists do.

08:39.200 --> 08:44.200
 I mean, Alan Turing was famously interested

08:44.400 --> 08:49.400
 and his most famous, one of his two most famous papers

08:49.760 --> 08:52.040
 was in a philosophy journal mind.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.700
 It was the one where he proposed the Turing test.

08:55.640 --> 08:59.920
 He took a Wittgenstein's course at Cambridge,

08:59.920 --> 09:01.440
 argued with him.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.840
 I just recently learned that little bit

09:03.840 --> 09:05.340
 and it's actually fascinating.

09:05.340 --> 09:08.440
 I was trying to look for resources

09:08.440 --> 09:12.400
 in trying to understand where the sources of disagreement

09:12.400 --> 09:15.720
 and debates between Wittgenstein and Turing were.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.480
 That's interesting that these two minds

09:17.480 --> 09:20.200
 have somehow met in the arc of history.

09:20.200 --> 09:25.200
 Yeah, well, the transcript of the course,

09:25.200 --> 09:26.880
 which was in 1939, right,

09:26.880 --> 09:29.960
 is one of the more fascinating documents that I've ever read

09:29.960 --> 09:33.560
 because Wittgenstein is trying to say,

09:33.560 --> 09:36.180
 well, all of these formal systems

09:36.180 --> 09:41.180
 are just complete irrelevancies, right?

09:41.680 --> 09:44.560
 If a formal system is irrelevant, who cares?

09:44.560 --> 09:46.880
 Why does that matter in real life, right?

09:46.880 --> 09:49.000
 And Turing is saying, well, look,

09:49.000 --> 09:52.640
 if you use an inconsistent formal system to design a bridge,

09:52.640 --> 09:55.160
 the bridge may collapse, right?

09:55.160 --> 09:58.900
 And so Turing, in some sense, is thinking decades ahead,

09:58.900 --> 10:01.640
 you know, I think, of where Wittgenstein is,

10:01.640 --> 10:05.040
 to where the formal systems are actually going to be used

10:05.040 --> 10:08.720
 in computers, right, to actually do things in the world.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.400
 You know, and it's interesting that Turing

10:10.400 --> 10:13.120
 actually dropped the course halfway through.

10:13.120 --> 10:13.960
 Why?

10:13.960 --> 10:15.320
 Because he had to go to Bletchley Park

10:15.320 --> 10:18.240
 and work on something of more immediate importance.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.880
 That's fascinating.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.180
 Take a step from philosophy to actual,

10:22.180 --> 10:25.020
 like the biggest possible step to actual engineering

10:25.020 --> 10:26.400
 with actual real impact.

10:26.400 --> 10:29.160
 Yeah, and I would say more generally, right,

10:30.360 --> 10:35.100
 a lot of scientists are interested in philosophy,

10:35.100 --> 10:36.700
 but they're also busy, right?

10:36.700 --> 10:39.460
 And they have a lot on their plate,

10:39.460 --> 10:42.760
 and there are a lot of sort of very concrete questions

10:42.760 --> 10:44.880
 that are already not answered,

10:44.880 --> 10:47.940
 but look like they might be answerable, right?

10:47.940 --> 10:52.880
 And so then you could say, well, then why break your brain

10:52.880 --> 10:55.940
 over these metaphysically unanswerable questions

10:55.940 --> 10:59.340
 when there were all of these answerable ones instead?

10:59.340 --> 11:03.240
 So I think, you know, for me,

11:03.240 --> 11:06.240
 I enjoy talking about philosophy.

11:06.240 --> 11:09.840
 I even go to philosophy conferences sometimes,

11:09.840 --> 11:12.040
 such as the FQXI conferences.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.920
 I enjoy interacting with philosophers.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.740
 I would not want to be a professional philosopher

11:17.740 --> 11:20.880
 because I like being in a field where I feel like,

11:20.880 --> 11:25.400
 you know, if I get too confused

11:25.400 --> 11:27.100
 about the sort of eternal questions,

11:27.100 --> 11:30.060
 then I can actually make progress on something.

11:30.060 --> 11:32.840
 Can you maybe link on that for just a little longer?

11:32.840 --> 11:34.600
 What do you think is the difference?

11:34.600 --> 11:37.640
 So like the corollary of the criticism

11:37.640 --> 11:40.120
 that I mentioned previously,

11:40.120 --> 11:42.520
 that why ask the philosophical questions

11:42.520 --> 11:44.960
 of the mathematician is if you want

11:44.960 --> 11:46.220
 to ask philosophical questions,

11:46.220 --> 11:49.020
 then invite a real philosopher on and ask them.

11:49.020 --> 11:51.200
 So what's the difference between the way

11:51.200 --> 11:52.920
 a computer scientist or mathematician

11:52.920 --> 11:54.640
 ponders a philosophical question

11:54.640 --> 11:57.280
 and a philosopher ponders a philosophical question?

11:57.280 --> 11:59.280
 Well, I mean, a lot of it just depends

11:59.280 --> 12:01.000
 on the individual, right?

12:01.000 --> 12:04.760
 It's hard to make generalizations about entire fields,

12:04.760 --> 12:09.560
 but, you know, I think if we tried to,

12:09.560 --> 12:11.440
 if we tried to stereotype, you know,

12:11.440 --> 12:16.440
 we would say that scientists very often

12:16.440 --> 12:21.440
 will be less careful in their use of words.

12:21.860 --> 12:24.160
 You know, I mean, philosophers are really experts

12:24.160 --> 12:27.140
 in sort of, you know, like when I talk to them,

12:27.140 --> 12:28.820
 they will just pounce if I, you know,

12:28.820 --> 12:30.780
 use the wrong phrase for something.

12:30.780 --> 12:32.540
 Experts is a very nice word.

12:32.540 --> 12:34.060
 You could say sticklers.

12:34.060 --> 12:35.980
 Sticklers, yeah, yeah, yeah, or, you know,

12:35.980 --> 12:39.140
 they will sort of interrogate my word choices,

12:39.140 --> 12:41.360
 let's say, to a much greater extent

12:41.360 --> 12:42.900
 than scientists would, right?

12:42.900 --> 12:46.300
 And scientists, you know, will often,

12:46.300 --> 12:48.940
 if you ask them about a philosophical problem,

12:48.940 --> 12:51.900
 like the hard problem of consciousness

12:51.900 --> 12:53.580
 or free will or whatever,

12:53.580 --> 12:55.740
 they will try to relate it back to, you know,

12:55.740 --> 13:00.740
 recent research, you know, research about neurobiology

13:01.200 --> 13:03.880
 or, you know, the best of all is research

13:03.880 --> 13:06.480
 that they personally are involved with, right?

13:06.480 --> 13:10.160
 And, you know, of course they will want to talk about that,

13:10.160 --> 13:12.260
 you know, and it is what they will think of, you know,

13:12.260 --> 13:14.140
 and of course you could have an argument

13:14.140 --> 13:17.300
 that maybe, you know, it's all interesting as it goes,

13:17.300 --> 13:20.100
 but maybe none of it touches the philosophical question,

13:20.100 --> 13:20.940
 right?

13:20.940 --> 13:24.300
 But, you know, but maybe, you know, a science,

13:24.300 --> 13:26.600
 you know, at least it, as I said,

13:26.600 --> 13:29.020
 it does tell us concrete things.

13:29.020 --> 13:33.520
 And, you know, even if like a deep dive into neurobiology

13:33.520 --> 13:36.580
 will not answer the hard problem of consciousness,

13:36.580 --> 13:40.540
 you know, maybe it can take us about as far as we can get

13:40.540 --> 13:44.420
 toward, you know, expanding our minds about it,

13:44.420 --> 13:47.220
 you know, toward thinking about it in a different way.

13:48.760 --> 13:51.080
 Well, I mean, I think neurobiology can do that,

13:51.080 --> 13:53.840
 but, you know, with these profound philosophical questions,

13:53.840 --> 13:56.940
 I mean, also art and literature do that, right?

13:56.940 --> 13:58.020
 They're all different ways

13:58.020 --> 14:00.260
 of trying to approach these questions that, you know,

14:00.260 --> 14:02.220
 we don't, for which we don't even know really

14:02.220 --> 14:03.700
 what an answer would look like,

14:03.700 --> 14:06.200
 but, and yet somehow we can't help,

14:06.200 --> 14:07.820
 but keep returning to the questions.

14:07.820 --> 14:09.260
 And you have a kind of mathematical,

14:09.260 --> 14:11.260
 beautiful mathematical way of discussing this

14:11.260 --> 14:12.740
 with the idea of Q prime.

14:12.740 --> 14:13.580
 Oh, right.

14:13.580 --> 14:16.780
 You write that usually the only way to make progress

14:16.780 --> 14:20.060
 on the big questions, like the philosophical questions

14:20.060 --> 14:24.340
 we're talking about now is to pick off smaller sub questions.

14:24.340 --> 14:26.380
 Ideally sub questions that you can attack

14:26.380 --> 14:29.140
 using math, empirical observation, or both.

14:29.140 --> 14:31.380
 You define the idea of a Q prime.

14:31.380 --> 14:36.140
 So given an unanswerable philosophical riddle Q,

14:36.140 --> 14:39.700
 replace it with a merely, in quotes, scientific

14:39.700 --> 14:41.900
 or mathematical question Q prime,

14:41.900 --> 14:44.840
 which captures part of what people have wanted to know

14:44.840 --> 14:47.300
 when they first asked Q.

14:47.300 --> 14:49.900
 Then with luck, one solves Q prime.

14:49.900 --> 14:54.900
 So you described some examples of such Q prime sub questions

14:55.420 --> 14:59.180
 in your long essay titled,

14:59.180 --> 15:02.460
 Why Philosophers Should Care About Computational Complexity.

15:02.460 --> 15:04.560
 So you catalog the various Q primes

15:04.560 --> 15:07.140
 on which you think theoretical computer science

15:07.140 --> 15:08.020
 has made progress.

15:08.020 --> 15:12.260
 Can you mention a few favorites, if any pop to mind,

15:12.260 --> 15:13.100
 or do you remember some?

15:13.100 --> 15:13.940
 Well, yeah.

15:13.940 --> 15:16.940
 So, I mean, I would say some of the most famous examples

15:16.940 --> 15:20.740
 in history of that sort of replacement were,

15:20.740 --> 15:23.240
 I mean, to go back to Alan Turing, right?

15:23.240 --> 15:26.460
 What he did in his computing machinery

15:26.460 --> 15:29.340
 and intelligence paper was exactly,

15:29.340 --> 15:32.100
 he explicitly started with the question,

15:32.100 --> 15:33.820
 can machines think?

15:33.820 --> 15:35.780
 And then he said, sorry,

15:35.780 --> 15:38.020
 I think that question is too meaningless,

15:38.020 --> 15:40.380
 but here's a different question.

15:40.380 --> 15:42.140
 Could you program a computer

15:42.140 --> 15:43.620
 so that you couldn't tell the difference

15:43.620 --> 15:45.220
 between it and a human, right?

15:45.220 --> 15:46.060
 And yeah.

15:46.060 --> 15:47.940
 So in the very first few sentences,

15:47.940 --> 15:50.900
 he in fact just formulates the Q prime question.

15:50.900 --> 15:52.600
 He does precisely that.

15:52.600 --> 15:56.140
 Or we could look at Gödel, right?

15:56.140 --> 16:00.420
 Where you had these philosophers arguing for centuries

16:00.420 --> 16:03.060
 about the limits of mathematical reasoning, right?

16:03.060 --> 16:04.660
 The limits of formal systems.

16:04.660 --> 16:08.740
 And then by the early 20th century,

16:08.740 --> 16:12.340
 logicians, starting with Frege, Russell,

16:12.340 --> 16:15.480
 and then most spectacularly Gödel,

16:15.480 --> 16:18.100
 managed to reframe those questions as,

16:18.100 --> 16:19.840
 look, we have these formal systems.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.500
 They have these definite rules.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.480
 Are there questions that we can phrase

16:23.480 --> 16:25.740
 within the rules of these systems

16:25.740 --> 16:28.220
 that are not provable within the rules of the systems?

16:28.220 --> 16:30.500
 And can we prove that fact, right?

16:30.500 --> 16:34.740
 And so that would be another example.

16:34.740 --> 16:36.640
 You know, I had this essay called

16:36.640 --> 16:38.980
 The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine.

16:38.980 --> 16:41.900
 That was one of the crazier things I've written,

16:41.900 --> 16:44.740
 but I tried to do something,

16:44.740 --> 16:48.740
 or to advocate doing something similar there for free will,

16:48.740 --> 16:53.220
 where instead of talking about is free will real,

16:53.220 --> 16:55.500
 where we get hung up on the meaning of,

16:55.500 --> 16:57.500
 what exactly do we mean by freedom?

16:57.500 --> 16:59.740
 And can you have, can you be,

16:59.740 --> 17:02.220
 or do we mean compatibilist free will,

17:02.220 --> 17:03.660
 libertarian free will?

17:03.660 --> 17:05.100
 What do these things mean?

17:05.100 --> 17:08.200
 You know, I suggested just asking the question,

17:08.200 --> 17:12.320
 how well in principle, consistently with the laws of physics,

17:12.320 --> 17:15.100
 could a person's behavior be predicted?

17:15.100 --> 17:16.620
 You know, without, so let's say,

17:16.620 --> 17:18.820
 destroying the person's brain, you know,

17:18.820 --> 17:22.140
 taking it apart in the process of trying to predict them.

17:22.140 --> 17:24.620
 And, you know, and that actually,

17:24.620 --> 17:27.700
 asking that question gets you into all sorts of meaty

17:27.700 --> 17:31.100
 and interesting issues, you know, issues of,

17:31.100 --> 17:33.820
 what is the computational substrate of the brain?

17:33.820 --> 17:37.100
 You know, or can you understand the brain, you know,

17:37.100 --> 17:39.740
 just at the sort of level of the neurons, you know,

17:39.740 --> 17:42.380
 at sort of the abstraction of a neural network,

17:42.380 --> 17:44.940
 or do you need to go deeper to the, you know,

17:44.940 --> 17:48.060
 molecular level and ultimately even to the quantum level?

17:48.060 --> 17:48.900
 Right, and of course,

17:48.900 --> 17:52.700
 that would put limits on predictability if you did.

17:52.700 --> 17:53.940
 So you need to reduce,

17:53.940 --> 17:58.580
 you need to reduce the mind to a computational device,

17:58.580 --> 18:01.180
 like formalize it so then you can make predictions

18:01.180 --> 18:03.860
 about what, you know, whether you could predict the behavior

18:03.860 --> 18:04.700
 of the system. Well, if you were trying

18:04.700 --> 18:06.860
 to predict a person, yeah, then presumably,

18:06.860 --> 18:09.180
 you would need some model of their brain, right?

18:09.180 --> 18:11.180
 And now the question becomes one of,

18:11.180 --> 18:13.780
 how accurate can such a model become?

18:13.780 --> 18:16.780
 Can you make a model that will be accurate enough

18:16.780 --> 18:21.060
 to really seriously threaten people's sense of free will?

18:21.060 --> 18:23.660
 You know, not just metaphysically, but like really,

18:23.660 --> 18:25.140
 I have written in this envelope

18:25.140 --> 18:26.780
 what you were going to say next.

18:26.780 --> 18:28.940
 Is accuracy the right term here?

18:28.940 --> 18:32.620
 So it's also a level of abstraction has to be right.

18:32.620 --> 18:37.620
 So if you're accurate at the, somehow at the quantum level,

18:39.060 --> 18:42.980
 that may not be convincing to us at the human level.

18:42.980 --> 18:46.100
 Well, right, but the question is what accuracy

18:46.100 --> 18:49.020
 at the sort of level of the underlying mechanisms

18:49.020 --> 18:52.180
 do you need in order to predict the behavior, right?

18:52.180 --> 18:54.300
 At the end of the day, the test is just,

18:54.300 --> 18:57.860
 can you, you know, foresee what the person is going to do?

18:57.860 --> 19:02.860
 Right, I am, you know, and in discussions of free will,

19:03.340 --> 19:06.340
 you know, it seems like both sides wanna, you know,

19:06.340 --> 19:09.420
 very quickly dismiss that question as irrelevant.

19:09.420 --> 19:11.420
 Well, to me, it's totally relevant.

19:11.420 --> 19:14.300
 Okay, because, you know, if someone says,

19:14.300 --> 19:16.900
 oh, well, you know, a Laplace demon

19:16.900 --> 19:19.900
 that knew the complete state of the universe,

19:19.900 --> 19:22.140
 you know, could predict everything you're going to do,

19:22.140 --> 19:24.100
 therefore you don't have free will.

19:24.100 --> 19:27.020
 You know, it doesn't trouble me that much because,

19:27.020 --> 19:29.820
 well, you know, I've never met such a demon, right?

19:29.820 --> 19:34.140
 You know, and we, you know, we even have some reasons

19:34.140 --> 19:35.180
 to think, you know, maybe, you know,

19:35.180 --> 19:37.260
 it could not exist as part of our world,

19:37.260 --> 19:40.740
 you know, it's only an abstraction, a thought experiment.

19:40.740 --> 19:42.540
 On the other hand, if someone said,

19:42.540 --> 19:44.940
 well, you know, I have this brain scanning machine,

19:44.940 --> 19:47.180
 you know, you step into it and then, you know,

19:47.180 --> 19:50.220
 every paper that you will ever write, it will write,

19:50.220 --> 19:52.420
 you know, every thought that you will have, you know,

19:52.420 --> 19:55.740
 even right now about the machine itself, it will foresee.

19:55.740 --> 19:58.620
 You know, well, if you can actually demonstrate that,

19:58.620 --> 20:01.620
 then I think, you know, that sort of threatens

20:01.620 --> 20:04.380
 my internal sense of having free will

20:04.380 --> 20:06.340
 in a much more visceral way.

20:06.340 --> 20:08.980
 You know, but now you notice that we're asking

20:08.980 --> 20:11.580
 a much more empirical question.

20:11.580 --> 20:14.700
 We're asking, is such a machine possible or isn't it?

20:14.700 --> 20:16.260
 We're asking, if it's not possible,

20:16.260 --> 20:18.380
 then what in the laws of physics

20:18.380 --> 20:21.180
 or what about the behavior of the brain,

20:21.180 --> 20:22.980
 you know, prevents it from existing?

20:22.980 --> 20:25.260
 So if you could philosophize a little bit

20:25.260 --> 20:27.740
 within this empirical question,

20:27.740 --> 20:31.420
 where do you think would enter the,

20:31.420 --> 20:33.820
 by which mechanism would enter the possibility

20:33.820 --> 20:35.580
 that we can't predict the outcome?

20:35.580 --> 20:37.220
 So there would be something

20:37.220 --> 20:38.860
 that would be akin to a free will.

20:38.860 --> 20:42.460
 Yeah, well, you could say the sort of obvious possibility,

20:42.460 --> 20:45.660
 which was, you know, recognized by Eddington

20:45.660 --> 20:48.020
 and many others about as soon as quantum mechanics

20:48.020 --> 20:52.380
 was discovered in the 1920s, was that if,

20:53.300 --> 20:56.180
 you know, let's say a sodium ion channel,

20:56.180 --> 21:00.500
 you know, in the brain, right?

21:00.500 --> 21:03.980
 You know, its behavior is chaotic, right?

21:03.980 --> 21:06.340
 It's sort of, it's governed by these

21:06.340 --> 21:10.940
 Hodgley–Huckskin equations in neuroscience, right?

21:10.940 --> 21:12.500
 Which are differential equations

21:12.500 --> 21:14.780
 that have a stochastic component, right?

21:14.780 --> 21:17.100
 Now, where does, you know, and this ultimately governs,

21:17.100 --> 21:19.460
 let's say whether a neuron will fire or not fire, right?

21:19.460 --> 21:21.700
 So that's the basic chemical process

21:21.700 --> 21:23.860
 or electrical process by which signals

21:23.860 --> 21:24.780
 are sent in the brain.

21:24.780 --> 21:25.980
 Exactly, exactly.

21:25.980 --> 21:28.780
 And, you know, and so you could ask,

21:28.780 --> 21:31.380
 well, where does the randomness in the process,

21:31.380 --> 21:34.100
 you know, that neuroscientists,

21:34.100 --> 21:38.020
 or what neuroscientists would treat as randomness,

21:38.020 --> 21:39.380
 where does it come from?

21:39.380 --> 21:41.700
 You know, ultimately it's thermal noise, right?

21:41.700 --> 21:43.580
 Where does thermal noise come from?

21:43.580 --> 21:44.860
 But ultimately, you know,

21:44.860 --> 21:46.780
 there were some quantum mechanical events

21:46.780 --> 21:48.060
 at the molecular level

21:48.060 --> 21:50.940
 that are getting sort of chaotically amplified

21:50.940 --> 21:53.660
 by, you know, a sort of butterfly effect.

21:53.660 --> 21:57.220
 And so, you know, even if you knew

21:57.220 --> 22:00.300
 the complete quantum state of someone's brain,

22:00.300 --> 22:02.780
 you know, at best you could predict the probabilities

22:02.780 --> 22:05.420
 that they would do one thing or do another thing, right?

22:05.420 --> 22:08.500
 I think that part is actually relatively uncontroversial,

22:08.500 --> 22:09.340
 right?

22:09.340 --> 22:13.340
 The controversial question is whether any of it matters

22:13.340 --> 22:16.100
 for the sort of philosophical questions that we care about.

22:16.100 --> 22:18.340
 Because you could say, if all it's doing

22:18.340 --> 22:20.340
 is just injecting some randomness

22:20.340 --> 22:23.700
 into an otherwise completely mechanistic process,

22:23.700 --> 22:25.140
 well, then who cares, right?

22:25.140 --> 22:28.460
 And more concretely, if you could build a machine

22:28.460 --> 22:30.980
 that, you know, could just calculate

22:30.980 --> 22:33.540
 even just the probabilities

22:33.540 --> 22:35.980
 of all of the possible things that you would do, right?

22:35.980 --> 22:39.940
 And, you know, of all the things that said

22:39.940 --> 22:41.860
 you had a 10% chance of doing,

22:41.860 --> 22:43.980
 you did exactly a 10th of them, you know,

22:43.980 --> 22:45.580
 and so on and so on.

22:45.580 --> 22:48.180
 And that somehow also takes away the feeling of free will.

22:48.180 --> 22:49.020
 Exactly.

22:49.020 --> 22:51.900
 I mean, to me, it seems essentially just as bad

22:51.900 --> 22:54.860
 as if the machine deterministically predicted you.

22:54.860 --> 22:57.340
 It seems, you know, hardly different from that.

22:57.340 --> 23:02.340
 So then, but a more subtle question

23:02.420 --> 23:04.060
 is could you even learn enough

23:04.060 --> 23:06.340
 about someone's brain to do that, okay?

23:06.340 --> 23:09.540
 Because, you know, another central fact

23:09.540 --> 23:14.140
 about quantum mechanics is that making a measurement

23:14.140 --> 23:18.060
 on a quantum state is an inherently destructive operation.

23:18.060 --> 23:21.660
 Okay, so, you know, if I want to measure the, you know,

23:21.660 --> 23:23.500
 position of a particle, right?

23:23.500 --> 23:25.300
 It was, well, before I measured,

23:25.300 --> 23:28.420
 it had a superposition over many different positions.

23:28.420 --> 23:30.980
 As soon as I measure, I localize it, right?

23:30.980 --> 23:32.340
 So now I know the position,

23:32.340 --> 23:35.260
 but I've also fundamentally changed the state.

23:35.260 --> 23:39.940
 And so you could say, well, maybe in trying to build

23:39.940 --> 23:42.780
 a model of someone's brain that was accurate enough

23:42.780 --> 23:44.700
 to actually, you know, make, let's say,

23:44.700 --> 23:48.340
 even well calibrated probabilistic predictions

23:48.340 --> 23:49.980
 of their future behavior,

23:49.980 --> 23:51.740
 maybe you would have to make measurements

23:51.740 --> 23:53.140
 that were just so accurate

23:53.140 --> 23:56.180
 that you would just fundamentally alter their brain, okay?

23:56.180 --> 23:59.580
 Or maybe not, maybe you only, you know,

23:59.580 --> 24:02.380
 it would suffice to just make some nanorobots

24:02.380 --> 24:05.700
 that just measured some sort of much larger scale,

24:05.700 --> 24:09.300
 you know, macroscopic behavior, like, you know,

24:09.300 --> 24:10.780
 what is this neuron doing?

24:10.780 --> 24:12.260
 What is that neuron doing?

24:12.260 --> 24:13.860
 Maybe that would be enough.

24:13.860 --> 24:16.940
 See, but now, you know, what I claim is that

24:16.940 --> 24:19.220
 we're now asking a question, you know,

24:19.220 --> 24:22.660
 in which, you know, it is possible to envision

24:22.660 --> 24:24.620
 what progress on it would look like.

24:24.620 --> 24:25.940
 Yeah, but just as you said,

24:25.940 --> 24:28.900
 that question may be slightly detached

24:28.900 --> 24:31.740
 from the philosophical question in the sense

24:31.740 --> 24:33.860
 if consciousness somehow has a role

24:33.860 --> 24:36.060
 to the experience of free will.

24:36.060 --> 24:38.340
 Because ultimately, when we're talking about free will,

24:38.340 --> 24:42.260
 we're also talking about not just the predictability

24:42.260 --> 24:44.900
 of our actions, but somehow the experience

24:44.900 --> 24:46.340
 of that predictability.

24:46.340 --> 24:49.420
 Yeah, well, I mean, a lot of philosophical questions

24:49.420 --> 24:52.260
 ultimately, like, feedback to the hard problem

24:52.260 --> 24:53.540
 of consciousness, you know,

24:53.540 --> 24:56.660
 and as much as you can try to sort of talk around it

24:56.660 --> 24:57.500
 or not, right?

24:57.500 --> 24:59.980
 And, you know, and there is a reason

24:59.980 --> 25:01.820
 why people try to talk around it,

25:01.820 --> 25:03.580
 which is that, you know,

25:03.580 --> 25:07.780
 Democritus talked about the hard problem of consciousness,

25:07.780 --> 25:11.180
 you know, in 400 BC in terms that would be

25:11.180 --> 25:13.900
 totally recognizable to us today, right?

25:13.900 --> 25:16.980
 And it's really not clear if there's been progress since

25:16.980 --> 25:19.540
 or what progress could possibly consist of.

25:19.540 --> 25:22.420
 Is there a Q prime type of subquestion

25:22.420 --> 25:24.380
 that could help us get at consciousness?

25:24.380 --> 25:25.660
 It's something about consciousness.

25:25.660 --> 25:27.740
 Well, I mean, well, I mean, there is the whole question

25:27.740 --> 25:29.620
 of, you know, of AI, right?

25:29.620 --> 25:33.700
 Of, you know, can you build a human level

25:33.700 --> 25:35.980
 or superhuman level AI?

25:35.980 --> 25:39.140
 And, you know, can it work in a completely different

25:39.140 --> 25:40.380
 substrate from the brain?

25:40.380 --> 25:41.580
 I mean, you know, and of course,

25:41.580 --> 25:43.460
 that was Alan Turing's point.

25:43.460 --> 25:45.500
 And, you know, and even if that was done,

25:45.500 --> 25:47.660
 it's, you know, maybe people would still argue

25:47.660 --> 25:49.940
 about the hard problem of consciousness, right?

25:49.940 --> 25:53.100
 And yet, you know, my claim is a little different.

25:53.100 --> 25:55.860
 My claim is that in a world where, you know,

25:55.860 --> 25:58.980
 there were, you know, human level AIs

25:58.980 --> 26:01.980
 or we'd been even overtaken by such AIs,

26:01.980 --> 26:05.940
 the entire discussion of the hard problem of consciousness

26:05.940 --> 26:07.660
 would have a different character, right?

26:07.660 --> 26:10.420
 It would take place in different terms in such a world,

26:10.420 --> 26:12.740
 even if we hadn't answered the question.

26:12.740 --> 26:15.620
 And my claim about free will would be similar, right?

26:15.620 --> 26:19.060
 That if this prediction machine that I was talking about

26:19.060 --> 26:21.980
 could actually be built, well, now the entire discussion

26:21.980 --> 26:24.620
 of the, you know, of free will is sort of transformed

26:24.620 --> 26:27.380
 by that, you know, even if in some sense

26:27.380 --> 26:30.180
 the metaphysical question hasn't been answered.

26:31.780 --> 26:34.180
 Yeah, exactly, it transforms it fundamentally

26:34.180 --> 26:35.900
 because say that machine does tell you

26:35.900 --> 26:37.620
 that it can predict perfectly

26:37.620 --> 26:40.100
 and yet there is this deep experience of free will

26:40.100 --> 26:43.100
 and then that changes the question completely.

26:43.100 --> 26:46.220
 And it starts actually getting to the question

26:46.220 --> 26:51.220
 of the AGI, the touring questions

26:51.580 --> 26:54.940
 of the demonstration of free will,

26:54.940 --> 26:56.580
 the demonstration of intelligence,

26:56.580 --> 26:58.500
 the demonstration of consciousness,

26:58.500 --> 27:02.300
 does that equal consciousness, intelligence and free will?

27:02.300 --> 27:07.300
 But see, Alex, if every time I was contemplating a decision,

27:07.580 --> 27:10.220
 you know, this machine had printed out an envelope,

27:10.220 --> 27:11.540
 you know, where I could open it

27:11.540 --> 27:13.220
 and see that it knew my decision,

27:13.220 --> 27:14.700
 I think that actually would change

27:14.700 --> 27:18.180
 my subjective experience of making decisions, right?

27:18.180 --> 27:19.020
 I mean, it would.

27:19.020 --> 27:20.860
 Does knowledge change your subjective experience?

27:20.860 --> 27:22.660
 Well, you know, I mean, the knowledge

27:22.660 --> 27:25.020
 that this machine had predicted everything I would do,

27:25.020 --> 27:27.780
 I mean, it might drive me completely insane, right?

27:27.780 --> 27:30.740
 But at any rate, it would change my experience

27:30.740 --> 27:33.820
 to act, you know, to not just discuss such a machine

27:33.820 --> 27:36.220
 as a thought experiment, but to actually see it.

27:37.140 --> 27:37.980
 Yeah.

27:39.180 --> 27:41.740
 I mean, you know, you could say at that point,

27:41.740 --> 27:43.380
 you know, you could say, you know,

27:43.380 --> 27:45.900
 why not simply call this machine

27:45.900 --> 27:49.180
 a second instantiation of me and be done with it, right?

27:49.180 --> 27:53.460
 What, you know, why even privilege the original me

27:53.460 --> 27:56.940
 over this perfect duplicate that exists in the machine?

27:56.940 --> 28:00.100
 Yeah, or there could be a religious experience with it too.

28:00.100 --> 28:02.460
 It's kind of what God throughout the generations

28:02.460 --> 28:03.780
 is supposed to have.

28:03.780 --> 28:06.860
 That God kind of represents that perfect machine,

28:06.860 --> 28:09.580
 is able to, I guess, actually,

28:10.780 --> 28:14.340
 well, I don't even know what are the religious

28:14.340 --> 28:16.220
 interpretations of free will.

28:17.660 --> 28:22.580
 So if God knows perfectly everything in religion,

28:22.580 --> 28:24.700
 in the various religions,

28:24.700 --> 28:26.580
 where does free will fit into that?

28:26.580 --> 28:27.420
 Do you know?

28:27.420 --> 28:30.220
 That has been one of the big things that theologians

28:30.220 --> 28:32.100
 have argued about for thousands of years.

28:32.100 --> 28:33.420
 Yeah.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.260
 You know, I am not a theologian,

28:35.260 --> 28:36.460
 so maybe I shouldn't go there.

28:36.460 --> 28:38.940
 So there's not a clear answer in a book like...

28:38.940 --> 28:41.940
 I mean, this is, you know, the Calvinists debated this,

28:41.940 --> 28:43.820
 the, you know, this has been, you know,

28:43.820 --> 28:46.180
 I mean, different religious movements

28:46.180 --> 28:48.180
 have taken different positions on that question,

28:48.180 --> 28:50.140
 but that is how they think about it.

28:50.140 --> 28:51.660
 You know, meanwhile, you know,

28:51.660 --> 28:54.700
 a large part of sort of what animates,

28:54.700 --> 28:56.580
 you know, theoretical computer science,

28:56.580 --> 28:58.500
 you could say is, you know, we're asking sort of,

28:58.500 --> 29:01.100
 what are the ultimate limits of, you know,

29:01.100 --> 29:05.540
 what you can know or, you know, calculate or figure out

29:05.540 --> 29:08.180
 by, you know, entities that you can actually build

29:08.180 --> 29:09.740
 in the physical world, right?

29:09.740 --> 29:12.860
 And if I were trying to explain it to a theologian,

29:12.860 --> 29:15.260
 maybe I would say, you know, we are studying, you know,

29:15.260 --> 29:16.460
 to what extent, you know,

29:16.460 --> 29:19.820
 gods can be made manifest in the physical world.

29:19.820 --> 29:21.620
 I'm not sure my colleagues would like that.

29:21.620 --> 29:25.660
 So let's talk about quantum computers for a second.

29:25.660 --> 29:27.340
 Yeah, sure, sure.

29:27.340 --> 29:29.180
 As you've said, quantum computing,

29:29.180 --> 29:32.300
 at least in the 1990s, was a profound story

29:32.300 --> 29:33.940
 at the intersection of computer science,

29:33.940 --> 29:36.340
 physics, engineering, math, and philosophy.

29:36.340 --> 29:40.260
 So there's this broad and deep aspect to quantum computing

29:40.260 --> 29:42.820
 that represents more than just the quantum computer.

29:42.820 --> 29:45.180
 But can we start at the very basics?

29:45.180 --> 29:47.700
 What is quantum computing?

29:47.700 --> 29:52.700
 Yeah, so it's a proposal for a new type of computation,

29:52.700 --> 29:56.580
 or let's say a new way to harness nature to do computation

29:56.580 --> 29:59.700
 that is based on the principles of quantum mechanics.

29:59.700 --> 30:01.980
 Okay, now the principles of quantum mechanics

30:01.980 --> 30:05.500
 have been in place since 1926.

30:05.500 --> 30:07.580
 You know, they haven't changed.

30:07.580 --> 30:10.620
 You know, what's new is, you know, how we wanna use them.

30:10.620 --> 30:15.140
 Okay, so what does quantum mechanics say about the world?

30:15.140 --> 30:18.060
 You know, the physicists, I think, over the generations,

30:18.060 --> 30:19.060
 you know, convinced people

30:19.060 --> 30:22.180
 that that is an unbelievably complicated question

30:22.180 --> 30:25.420
 and, you know, just give up on trying to understand it.

30:25.420 --> 30:28.060
 I can let you in, not being a physicist,

30:28.060 --> 30:29.460
 I can let you in on a secret,

30:29.460 --> 30:32.060
 which is that it becomes a lot simpler

30:32.060 --> 30:35.300
 if you do what we do in quantum information theory

30:35.300 --> 30:37.460
 and sort of take the physics out of it.

30:37.460 --> 30:40.780
 So the way that we think about quantum mechanics

30:40.780 --> 30:42.820
 is sort of as a generalization

30:42.820 --> 30:45.300
 of the rules of probability themselves.

30:45.300 --> 30:50.300
 So, you know, you might say there was a 30% chance

30:50.300 --> 30:52.620
 that it was going to snow today or something.

30:52.620 --> 30:55.500
 You would never say that there was a negative 30% chance,

30:55.500 --> 30:57.420
 right, that would be nonsense.

30:57.420 --> 30:59.260
 Much less would you say that there was, you know,

30:59.260 --> 31:03.740
 an I% chance, you know, square root of minus 1% chance.

31:03.740 --> 31:06.100
 Now, the central discovery

31:06.100 --> 31:09.460
 that sort of quantum mechanics made

31:09.460 --> 31:14.460
 is that fundamentally the world is described by,

31:16.420 --> 31:18.780
 or, you know, the sort of, let's say the possibilities

31:18.780 --> 31:21.860
 for, you know, what a system could be doing

31:21.860 --> 31:25.540
 are described using numbers called amplitudes, okay,

31:25.540 --> 31:29.020
 which are like probabilities in some ways,

31:29.020 --> 31:30.780
 but they are not probabilities.

31:30.780 --> 31:31.900
 They can be positive.

31:31.900 --> 31:34.540
 For one thing, they can be positive or negative.

31:34.540 --> 31:37.140
 In fact, they can even be complex numbers.

31:37.140 --> 31:39.980
 Okay, and if you've heard of a quantum superposition,

31:39.980 --> 31:43.180
 this just means some state of affairs

31:43.180 --> 31:45.380
 where you assign an amplitude,

31:45.380 --> 31:47.100
 one of these complex numbers,

31:47.100 --> 31:51.060
 to every possible configuration

31:51.060 --> 31:53.340
 that you could see a system in on measuring it.

31:53.340 --> 31:56.700
 So for example, you might say that an electron

31:56.700 --> 31:59.420
 has some amplitude for being here

31:59.420 --> 32:02.260
 and some other amplitude for being there, right?

32:02.260 --> 32:04.740
 Now, if you look to see where it is,

32:04.740 --> 32:06.460
 you will localize it, right?

32:06.460 --> 32:09.140
 You will sort of force the amplitudes

32:09.140 --> 32:12.220
 to be converted into probabilities.

32:12.220 --> 32:15.300
 That happens by taking their squared absolute value, okay,

32:15.300 --> 32:19.460
 and then, you know, you can say

32:19.460 --> 32:22.580
 either the electron will be here or it will be there.

32:22.580 --> 32:24.180
 And, you know, knowing the amplitudes,

32:24.180 --> 32:26.540
 you can predict at least the probabilities

32:26.540 --> 32:29.900
 that you'll see each possible outcome, okay?

32:29.900 --> 32:32.540
 But while a system is isolated

32:32.540 --> 32:34.660
 from the whole rest of the universe,

32:34.660 --> 32:36.380
 the rest of its environment,

32:36.380 --> 32:38.820
 the amplitudes can change in time

32:38.820 --> 32:41.380
 by rules that are different

32:41.380 --> 32:44.420
 from the normal rules of probability

32:44.420 --> 32:47.540
 and that are, you know, alien to our everyday experience.

32:47.540 --> 32:50.420
 So anytime anyone ever tells you anything

32:50.420 --> 32:52.620
 about the weirdness of the quantum world,

32:52.620 --> 32:55.940
 you know, or assuming that they're not lying to you, right,

32:55.940 --> 32:57.780
 they are telling you, you know,

32:57.780 --> 33:00.140
 yet another consequence of nature

33:00.140 --> 33:03.060
 being described by these amplitudes.

33:03.060 --> 33:05.860
 So most famously, what amplitudes can do

33:05.860 --> 33:08.060
 is that they can interfere with each other, okay?

33:08.060 --> 33:11.300
 So in the famous double slit experiment,

33:11.300 --> 33:13.580
 what happens is that you shoot a particle,

33:13.580 --> 33:15.300
 like an electron, let's say,

33:15.300 --> 33:17.540
 at a screen with two slits in it,

33:17.540 --> 33:21.020
 and you find that there are, you know, on a second screen,

33:21.020 --> 33:22.660
 now there are certain places

33:22.660 --> 33:25.020
 where that electron will never end up,

33:25.020 --> 33:29.420
 you know, after it passes through the first screen.

33:29.420 --> 33:32.460
 And yet, if I close off one of the slits,

33:32.460 --> 33:35.300
 then the electron can appear in that place, okay?

33:35.300 --> 33:38.020
 So by decreasing the number of paths

33:38.020 --> 33:40.540
 that the electron could take to get somewhere,

33:40.540 --> 33:43.260
 you can increase the chance that it gets there, okay?

33:43.260 --> 33:45.140
 Now, how is that possible?

33:45.140 --> 33:48.580
 Well, it's because, you know, as we would say now,

33:48.580 --> 33:51.620
 the electron has a superposition state, okay?

33:51.620 --> 33:54.860
 It has some amplitude for reaching this point

33:54.860 --> 33:57.620
 by going through the first slit.

33:57.620 --> 33:59.660
 It has some other amplitude for reaching it

33:59.660 --> 34:01.500
 by going through the second slit.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.820
 But now, if one amplitude is positive

34:03.820 --> 34:05.540
 and the other one is negative,

34:05.540 --> 34:07.860
 then, you know, I have to add them all up, right?

34:07.860 --> 34:10.620
 I have to add the amplitudes for every path

34:10.620 --> 34:13.620
 that the electron could have taken to reach this point.

34:13.620 --> 34:15.540
 And those amplitudes,

34:15.540 --> 34:17.620
 if they're pointing in different directions,

34:17.620 --> 34:19.540
 they can cancel each other out.

34:19.540 --> 34:21.940
 That would mean the total amplitude is zero

34:21.940 --> 34:24.060
 and the thing never happens at all.

34:24.060 --> 34:26.180
 I close off one of the possibilities,

34:26.180 --> 34:28.620
 then the amplitude is positive or it's negative,

34:28.620 --> 34:30.300
 and now the thing can happen.

34:30.300 --> 34:33.900
 Okay, so that is sort of the one trick of quantum mechanics.

34:33.900 --> 34:36.620
 And now I can tell you what a quantum computer is.

34:36.620 --> 34:41.060
 Okay, a quantum computer is a computer

34:41.060 --> 34:45.460
 that tries to exploit, you know, exactly these phenomena,

34:45.460 --> 34:48.940
 superposition, amplitudes, and interference,

34:48.940 --> 34:52.060
 in order to solve certain problems much faster

34:52.060 --> 34:54.260
 than we know how to solve them otherwise.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.740
 So the basic building block of a quantum computer

34:56.740 --> 34:59.940
 is what we call a quantum bit or a qubit.

34:59.940 --> 35:03.460
 That just means a bit that has some amplitude for being zero

35:03.460 --> 35:05.860
 and some other amplitude for being one.

35:05.860 --> 35:09.260
 So it's a superposition of zero and one states, right?

35:09.260 --> 35:12.300
 But now the key point is that if I've got,

35:12.300 --> 35:14.740
 let's say, a thousand qubits,

35:14.740 --> 35:18.060
 the rules of quantum mechanics are completely unequivocal

35:18.060 --> 35:20.340
 that I do not just need one ampli...

35:20.340 --> 35:23.540
 You know, I don't just need amplitudes for each qubit separately.

35:23.540 --> 35:26.100
 Okay, in general, I need an amplitude

35:26.100 --> 35:30.780
 for every possible setting of all thousand of those bits, okay?

35:30.780 --> 35:34.900
 So that what that means is two to the one thousand power amplitudes.

35:34.900 --> 35:37.620
 Okay, if I had to write those down,

35:37.620 --> 35:40.420
 or let's say in the memory of a conventional computer,

35:40.420 --> 35:43.740
 if I had to write down two to the one thousand complex numbers,

35:43.740 --> 35:47.340
 that would not fit within the entire observable universe.

35:47.340 --> 35:50.860
 Okay, and yet, you know, quantum mechanics is unequivocal

35:50.860 --> 35:53.860
 that if these qubits can all interact with each other,

35:53.860 --> 35:58.020
 and in some sense, I need two to the one thousand parameters,

35:58.020 --> 36:01.180
 you know, amplitudes to describe what is going on.

36:01.180 --> 36:05.900
 Now, you know, now I can tell, you know, where all the popular articles,

36:05.900 --> 36:08.380
 you know, about quantum computing go off the rails

36:08.380 --> 36:11.860
 is that they say, you know, they sort of say what I just said,

36:11.860 --> 36:14.620
 and then they say, oh, so the way a quantum computer works

36:14.620 --> 36:17.900
 is just by trying every possible answer in parallel.

36:17.900 --> 36:21.020
 You know, that sounds too good to be true,

36:21.020 --> 36:24.620
 and unfortunately, it kind of is too good to be true.

36:24.620 --> 36:27.980
 The problem is I could make a superposition

36:27.980 --> 36:31.340
 over every possible answer to my problem, you know,

36:31.340 --> 36:34.060
 even if there are two to the one thousand of them, right?

36:34.060 --> 36:35.740
 I can easily do that.

36:35.740 --> 36:38.140
 The trouble is for a computer to be useful,

36:38.140 --> 36:40.300
 you've got to, at some point, you've got to look at it

36:40.300 --> 36:42.380
 and see an output, right?

36:42.380 --> 36:46.700
 And if I just measure a superposition over every possible answer,

36:46.700 --> 36:48.620
 then the rules of quantum mechanics tell me

36:48.620 --> 36:51.340
 that all I'll see will be a random answer.

36:51.340 --> 36:53.020
 You know, if I just wanted a random answer,

36:53.020 --> 36:56.300
 well, I could have picked one myself with a lot less trouble, right?

36:56.300 --> 36:59.980
 So the entire trick with quantum computing,

36:59.980 --> 37:02.780
 with every algorithm for a quantum computer,

37:02.780 --> 37:05.740
 is that you try to choreograph a pattern

37:05.740 --> 37:08.380
 of interference of amplitudes,

37:08.380 --> 37:11.500
 and you try to do it so that for each wrong answer,

37:11.500 --> 37:14.060
 some of the paths leading to that wrong answer

37:14.060 --> 37:17.900
 have positive amplitudes and others have negative amplitudes.

37:17.900 --> 37:20.540
 So on the whole, they cancel each other out, okay?

37:20.540 --> 37:23.420
 Whereas all the paths leading to the right answer

37:23.420 --> 37:26.620
 should reinforce each other, you know, should have amplitudes

37:26.620 --> 37:28.060
 pointing the same direction.

37:28.060 --> 37:30.700
 So the design of algorithms in the space

37:30.700 --> 37:33.100
 is the choreography of the interferences.

37:33.100 --> 37:35.020
 Precisely. That's precisely what it is.

37:35.020 --> 37:36.700
 Can we take a brief step back?

37:36.700 --> 37:39.820
 And you mentioned information.

37:39.820 --> 37:40.380
 Yes.

37:40.380 --> 37:43.180
 So in which part of this beautiful picture

37:43.180 --> 37:46.620
 that you've painted is information contained?

37:46.620 --> 37:49.500
 Oh, well, information is at the core of everything

37:49.500 --> 37:51.020
 that we've been talking about, right?

37:51.020 --> 37:55.260
 I mean, the bit is, you know, the basic unit of information

37:55.260 --> 37:58.940
 since, you know, Claude Shannon's paper in 1948.

37:58.940 --> 38:00.140
 You know, and, you know, of course, you know,

38:00.140 --> 38:02.460
 people had the concept even before that, you know,

38:02.460 --> 38:05.100
 he popularized the name, right?

38:05.100 --> 38:05.740
 But I mean...

38:05.740 --> 38:07.740
 But a bit is zero or one.

38:07.740 --> 38:08.220
 That's right.

38:08.220 --> 38:08.940
 So that's a basic element of information.

38:08.940 --> 38:09.420
 That's right.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.740
 And what we would say is that the basic unit

38:11.740 --> 38:14.540
 of quantum information is the qubit,

38:14.540 --> 38:16.940
 is, you know, the object, any object

38:16.940 --> 38:20.860
 that can be maintained in this, or manipulated,

38:20.860 --> 38:23.260
 in a superposition of zero and one states.

38:24.060 --> 38:26.380
 Now, you know, sometimes people ask, well,

38:26.380 --> 38:29.020
 but what is a qubit physically, right?

38:29.020 --> 38:31.260
 And there are all these different, you know,

38:32.220 --> 38:34.700
 proposals that are being pursued in parallel

38:34.700 --> 38:36.860
 for how you implement qubits.

38:36.860 --> 38:39.660
 There is, you know, superconducting quantum computing

38:39.660 --> 38:41.420
 that was in the news recently

38:41.420 --> 38:44.940
 because of Google's quantum supremacy experiment, right?

38:44.940 --> 38:49.500
 Where you would have some little coils

38:49.500 --> 38:52.220
 where a current can flow through them

38:52.220 --> 38:54.300
 in two different energy states,

38:54.300 --> 38:57.500
 one representing a zero, another representing a one.

38:57.500 --> 38:59.180
 And if you cool these coils

38:59.180 --> 39:02.060
 to just slightly above absolute zero,

39:02.060 --> 39:05.500
 like a hundredth of a degree, then they superconduct.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.260
 And then the current can actually be

39:07.260 --> 39:09.420
 in a superposition of the two different states.

39:10.620 --> 39:12.300
 So that's one kind of qubit.

39:12.300 --> 39:14.460
 Another kind would be, you know,

39:14.460 --> 39:17.660
 just an individual atomic nucleus, right?

39:17.660 --> 39:18.940
 It has a spin.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.940
 It could be spinning clockwise.

39:20.940 --> 39:23.020
 It could be spinning counterclockwise,

39:23.020 --> 39:25.980
 or it could be in a superposition of the two spin states.

39:25.980 --> 39:27.420
 That is another qubit.

39:27.420 --> 39:30.220
 But see, just like in the classical world, right?

39:30.220 --> 39:32.780
 You could be a virtuoso programmer

39:32.780 --> 39:36.300
 without having any idea of what a transistor is, right?

39:36.300 --> 39:40.380
 Or how the bits are physically represented inside the machine,

39:40.380 --> 39:43.180
 even that the machine uses electricity, right?

39:43.180 --> 39:44.940
 You just care about the logic.

39:44.940 --> 39:47.260
 It's sort of the same with quantum computing, right?

39:47.260 --> 39:49.420
 Qubits could be realized by many,

39:49.420 --> 39:51.260
 many different quantum systems.

39:51.260 --> 39:54.380
 And yet all of those systems will lead to the same logic,

39:54.380 --> 39:58.540
 you know, the logic of qubits and how, you know,

39:58.540 --> 40:01.420
 how you measure them, how you change them over time.

40:01.420 --> 40:03.980
 And so, you know, the subject of, you know,

40:03.980 --> 40:07.420
 how qubits behave and what you can do with qubits,

40:07.420 --> 40:09.260
 that is quantum information.

40:09.260 --> 40:10.940
 So just to linger on that.

40:10.940 --> 40:11.260
 Sure.

40:11.260 --> 40:14.380
 So the physical design implementation of a qubit

40:14.380 --> 40:18.700
 does not interfere with the,

40:18.700 --> 40:22.380
 that next level of abstraction that you can program over it.

40:22.380 --> 40:27.020
 So it truly is, the idea of it is, okay.

40:27.020 --> 40:28.780
 Well, to be honest with you,

40:28.780 --> 40:30.700
 today they do interfere with each other.

40:30.700 --> 40:32.860
 That's because all the quantum computers

40:32.860 --> 40:35.420
 we can build today are very noisy, right?

40:35.420 --> 40:37.820
 And so sort of the, you know,

40:37.820 --> 40:40.940
 the qubits are very far from perfect.

40:40.940 --> 40:43.900
 And so the lower level sort of does affect the higher levels.

40:43.900 --> 40:46.380
 And we sort of have to think about all of them at once.

40:46.380 --> 40:49.180
 Okay, but eventually where we hope to get

40:49.180 --> 40:52.460
 is to what are called error corrected quantum computers,

40:52.460 --> 40:54.540
 where the qubits really do behave

40:54.540 --> 40:58.780
 like perfect abstract qubits for as long as we want them to.

40:58.780 --> 41:00.380
 And in that future, you know,

41:01.500 --> 41:04.940
 a future that we can already sort of prove theorems about

41:04.940 --> 41:06.380
 or think about today.

41:06.380 --> 41:09.500
 But in that future, the logic of it

41:09.500 --> 41:11.980
 really does become decoupled from the hardware.

41:11.980 --> 41:15.580
 So if noise is currently like the biggest problem

41:16.300 --> 41:18.220
 for quantum computing,

41:18.220 --> 41:23.020
 and then the dream is error correcting quantum computers,

41:23.020 --> 41:26.620
 can you just maybe describe what does it mean

41:26.620 --> 41:28.780
 for there to be noise in the system?

41:28.780 --> 41:31.020
 Absolutely, so yeah, so the problem

41:31.020 --> 41:33.100
 is even a little more specific than noise.

41:33.100 --> 41:35.260
 So the fundamental problem,

41:35.260 --> 41:38.380
 if you're trying to actually build a quantum computer,

41:38.380 --> 41:41.260
 you know, of any appreciable size,

41:41.260 --> 41:43.660
 is something called decoherence.

41:43.660 --> 41:46.220
 Okay, and this was recognized from the very beginning,

41:46.220 --> 41:48.460
 you know, when people first started thinking about this

41:48.460 --> 41:49.980
 in the 1990s.

41:49.980 --> 41:52.620
 Now, what decoherence means

41:52.620 --> 41:54.780
 is sort of the unwanted interaction

41:54.780 --> 41:56.860
 between, you know, your qubits,

41:56.860 --> 41:59.180
 you know, the state of your quantum computer

41:59.180 --> 42:01.100
 and the external environment.

42:01.100 --> 42:03.100
 Okay, and why is that such a problem?

42:03.100 --> 42:05.180
 Well, I talked before about how, you know,

42:05.180 --> 42:07.660
 when you measure a quantum system,

42:07.660 --> 42:09.900
 so let's say if I measure a qubit

42:09.900 --> 42:12.140
 that's in a superposition of zero and one states

42:12.140 --> 42:14.620
 to ask it, you know, are you zero or are you one?

42:14.620 --> 42:17.100
 Well, now I force it to make up its mind, right?

42:17.100 --> 42:20.860
 And now, probabilistically, it chooses one or the other

42:20.860 --> 42:23.260
 and now, you know, it's no longer a superposition,

42:23.260 --> 42:25.020
 there's no longer amplitudes,

42:25.020 --> 42:27.500
 there's just, there's some probability that I get a zero

42:27.500 --> 42:29.180
 and there's some that I get a one.

42:29.180 --> 42:35.180
 And now, the trouble is that it doesn't have to be me

42:35.180 --> 42:36.300
 who's looking, okay?

42:36.300 --> 42:40.380
 Or in fact, it doesn't have to be any conscious entity.

42:40.380 --> 42:44.220
 Any kind of interaction with the external world

42:44.220 --> 42:46.620
 that leaks out the information

42:46.620 --> 42:49.900
 about whether this qubit was a zero or a one,

42:49.900 --> 42:52.380
 sort of that causes the zerowness

42:52.380 --> 42:55.740
 or the oneness of the qubit to be recorded

42:55.740 --> 42:58.220
 in, you know, the radiation in the room,

42:58.220 --> 43:00.540
 in the molecules of the air,

43:00.540 --> 43:03.900
 in the wires that are connected to my device,

43:03.900 --> 43:07.900
 any of that, as soon as the information leaks out,

43:07.900 --> 43:11.020
 it is as if that qubit has been measured, okay?

43:11.020 --> 43:14.460
 It is, you know, the state has now collapsed.

43:15.020 --> 43:16.220
 You know, another way to say it

43:16.220 --> 43:19.340
 is that it's become entangled with its environment, okay?

43:19.340 --> 43:21.740
 But, you know, from the perspective of someone

43:21.740 --> 43:23.420
 who's just looking at this qubit,

43:23.420 --> 43:26.700
 it is as though it has lost its quantum state.

43:26.700 --> 43:28.540
 And so, what this means is that

43:28.540 --> 43:31.660
 if I want to do a quantum computation,

43:31.660 --> 43:34.780
 I have to keep the qubits sort of fanatically

43:34.780 --> 43:37.340
 well isolated from their environment.

43:37.340 --> 43:38.540
 But then at the same time,

43:38.540 --> 43:40.300
 they can't be perfectly isolated

43:40.300 --> 43:42.460
 because I need to tell them what to do.

43:42.460 --> 43:45.100
 I need to make them interact with each other,

43:45.100 --> 43:46.940
 for one thing, and not only that,

43:46.940 --> 43:50.060
 but in a precisely choreographed way, okay?

43:50.060 --> 43:53.420
 And, you know, that is such a staggering problem, right?

43:53.420 --> 43:56.300
 How do I isolate these qubits from the whole universe

43:56.300 --> 43:58.700
 but then also tell them exactly what to do?

43:58.700 --> 44:01.420
 I mean, you know, there were distinguished physicists

44:01.420 --> 44:04.620
 and computer scientists in the 90s who said,

44:04.620 --> 44:07.020
 this is fundamentally impossible, you know?

44:07.020 --> 44:10.540
 The laws of physics will just never let you control qubits

44:10.540 --> 44:13.260
 to the degree of accuracy that you're talking about.

44:14.140 --> 44:17.660
 Now, what changed the views of most of us

44:17.660 --> 44:22.300
 was a profound discovery in the mid to late 90s

44:22.300 --> 44:25.340
 which was called the theory of quantum error correction

44:25.340 --> 44:27.580
 and quantum fault tolerance, okay?

44:27.580 --> 44:29.980
 And the upshot of that theory is that

44:29.980 --> 44:33.500
 if I want to build a reliable quantum computer

44:33.500 --> 44:36.300
 and scale it up to, you know, an arbitrary number

44:36.300 --> 44:38.540
 of as many qubits as I want, you know,

44:38.540 --> 44:40.620
 and doing as much on them as I want,

44:41.180 --> 44:43.580
 I do not actually have to get the qubits

44:43.580 --> 44:46.060
 perfectly isolated from their environment.

44:46.060 --> 44:50.060
 It is enough to get them really, really, really well isolated, okay?

44:50.060 --> 44:54.620
 And even if every qubit is sort of leaking,

44:54.620 --> 44:57.820
 you know, its state into the environment at some rate,

44:57.820 --> 45:00.460
 as long as that rate is low enough, okay,

45:00.460 --> 45:04.380
 I can sort of encode the information that I care about

45:05.100 --> 45:08.300
 in very clever ways across the collective states

45:08.300 --> 45:10.140
 of multiple qubits, okay?

45:10.140 --> 45:12.380
 In such a way that even if, you know,

45:12.380 --> 45:14.940
 a small percentage of my qubits leak,

45:14.940 --> 45:16.860
 well, I'm constantly monitoring them

45:16.860 --> 45:18.380
 to see if that leak happened.

45:18.380 --> 45:20.940
 I can detect it and I can correct it.

45:20.940 --> 45:23.340
 I can recover the information I care about

45:23.340 --> 45:25.500
 from the remaining qubits, okay?

45:25.500 --> 45:30.300
 And so, you know, you can build a reliable quantum computer

45:30.300 --> 45:32.700
 even out of unreliable parts, right?

45:32.700 --> 45:35.740
 Now, in some sense, you know,

45:35.740 --> 45:39.100
 that discovery is what set the engineering agenda

45:39.100 --> 45:41.020
 for quantum computing research

45:41.020 --> 45:43.660
 from the 1990s until the present, okay?

45:43.660 --> 45:45.420
 The goal has been, you know,

45:45.420 --> 45:48.940
 engineer qubits that are not perfectly reliable

45:48.940 --> 45:51.900
 but reliable enough that you can then use

45:51.900 --> 45:53.820
 these error correcting codes

45:53.820 --> 45:56.140
 to have them simulate qubits

45:56.140 --> 45:58.940
 that are even more reliable than they are, right?

45:58.940 --> 46:01.020
 The error correction becomes a net win

46:01.020 --> 46:02.860
 rather than a net loss, right?

46:02.860 --> 46:05.900
 And then once you reach that sort of crossover point,

46:05.900 --> 46:08.220
 then, you know, your simulated qubits

46:08.220 --> 46:10.140
 could in turn simulate qubits

46:10.140 --> 46:12.460
 that are even more reliable and so on

46:12.460 --> 46:14.540
 until you've just, you know, effectively,

46:14.540 --> 46:17.020
 you have arbitrarily reliable qubits.

46:17.020 --> 46:18.140
 So long story short,

46:18.140 --> 46:20.620
 we are not at that breakeven point yet.

46:20.620 --> 46:22.540
 We're a hell of a lot closer than we were

46:22.540 --> 46:24.700
 when people started doing this in the 90s,

46:24.700 --> 46:26.300
 like orders of magnitude closer.

46:26.300 --> 46:27.580
 But the key ingredient there

46:27.580 --> 46:30.300
 is the more qubits, the better because...

46:30.300 --> 46:32.060
 Ah, well, the more qubits,

46:32.060 --> 46:35.100
 the larger the computation you can do, right?

46:35.100 --> 46:38.060
 I mean, qubits are what constitute

46:38.060 --> 46:40.300
 the memory of your quantum computer, right?

46:40.300 --> 46:41.580
 But also for the, sorry,

46:41.580 --> 46:43.100
 for the error correcting mechanism.

46:43.100 --> 46:43.660
 Ah, yes.

46:44.540 --> 46:45.980
 So the way I would say it

46:45.980 --> 46:48.780
 is that error correction imposes an overhead

46:48.780 --> 46:50.220
 in the number of qubits.

46:50.220 --> 46:53.260
 And that is actually one of the biggest practical problems

46:53.260 --> 46:55.500
 with building a scalable quantum computer.

46:55.500 --> 46:57.900
 If you look at the error correcting codes,

46:57.900 --> 47:00.380
 at least the ones that we know about today,

47:00.380 --> 47:01.340
 and you look at, you know,

47:01.340 --> 47:04.460
 what would it take to actually use a quantum computer

47:04.460 --> 47:09.100
 to, you know, hack your credit card number,

47:09.100 --> 47:10.060
 which is, you know,

47:10.060 --> 47:11.980
 maybe, you know, the most famous application

47:11.980 --> 47:13.180
 people talk about, right?

47:13.180 --> 47:15.180
 Let's say to factor huge numbers

47:15.180 --> 47:17.900
 and thereby break the RSA cryptosystem.

47:17.900 --> 47:19.420
 Well, what that would take

47:19.420 --> 47:23.980
 would be thousands of, several thousand logical qubits.

47:23.980 --> 47:26.460
 But now with the known error correcting codes,

47:26.460 --> 47:28.220
 each of those logical qubits

47:28.220 --> 47:29.980
 would need to be encoded itself

47:29.980 --> 47:32.220
 using thousands of physical qubits.

47:32.220 --> 47:32.940
 So at that point,

47:32.940 --> 47:35.740
 you're talking about millions of physical qubits.

47:35.740 --> 47:36.620
 And in some sense,

47:36.620 --> 47:38.860
 that is the reason why quantum computers

47:38.860 --> 47:40.780
 are not breaking cryptography already.

47:40.780 --> 47:43.740
 It's because of these immense overheads involved.

47:43.740 --> 47:46.300
 So that overhead is additive or multiplicative?

47:46.300 --> 47:47.420
 Well, it's multiplicative.

47:47.420 --> 47:49.580
 I mean, it's like you take the number

47:49.580 --> 47:52.460
 of logical qubits that you need

47:52.460 --> 47:54.380
 in your abstract quantum circuit,

47:54.380 --> 47:56.700
 you multiply it by a thousand or so.

47:56.700 --> 47:58.220
 So, you know, there's a lot of work

47:58.220 --> 47:59.900
 on, you know, inventing better,

47:59.900 --> 48:02.220
 trying to invent better error correcting codes.

48:02.220 --> 48:04.140
 Okay, that is the situation right now.

48:04.140 --> 48:06.700
 In the meantime, we are now in,

48:07.420 --> 48:09.580
 what the physicist John Preskill called

48:09.580 --> 48:13.420
 the noisy intermediate scale quantum or NISQ era.

48:13.420 --> 48:14.540
 And this is the era,

48:14.540 --> 48:16.780
 you can think of it as sort of like the vacuum,

48:16.780 --> 48:19.020
 you know, we're now entering the very early

48:19.020 --> 48:21.740
 vacuum tube era of quantum computers.

48:21.740 --> 48:24.700
 The quantum computer analog of the transistor

48:24.700 --> 48:26.460
 has not been invented yet, right?

48:26.460 --> 48:29.020
 That would be like true error correction, right?

48:29.020 --> 48:31.420
 Where, you know, we are not or something else

48:31.420 --> 48:33.420
 that would achieve the same effect, right?

48:33.420 --> 48:34.540
 We are not there yet.

48:37.020 --> 48:38.300
 But where we are now,

48:38.300 --> 48:40.140
 let's say as of a few months ago,

48:40.140 --> 48:41.980
 you know, as of Google's announcement

48:41.980 --> 48:43.500
 of quantum supremacy,

48:43.500 --> 48:45.660
 you know, we are now finally at the point

48:45.660 --> 48:49.260
 where even with a non error corrected quantum computer,

48:49.260 --> 48:51.260
 with, you know, these noisy devices,

48:51.260 --> 48:53.740
 we can do something that is hard

48:53.740 --> 48:56.380
 for classical computers to simulate, okay?

48:56.380 --> 48:58.620
 So we can eke out some advantage.

48:58.620 --> 49:00.620
 Now, will we in this noisy era

49:00.620 --> 49:02.620
 be able to do something beyond

49:02.620 --> 49:04.140
 what a classical computer can do

49:04.140 --> 49:06.380
 that is also useful to someone?

49:06.380 --> 49:07.660
 That we still don't know.

49:07.660 --> 49:10.460
 People are going to be racing over the next decade

49:10.460 --> 49:11.420
 to try to do that.

49:11.420 --> 49:13.580
 By people, I mean, Google, IBM,

49:13.580 --> 49:16.220
 you know, a bunch of startup companies.

49:16.220 --> 49:18.540
 And research labs.

49:18.540 --> 49:21.180
 Yeah, and research labs and governments.

49:21.180 --> 49:22.460
 And yeah.

49:22.460 --> 49:23.980
 You just mentioned a million things.

49:23.980 --> 49:25.580
 Well, I'll backtrack for a second.

49:25.580 --> 49:26.380
 Yeah, sure, sure.

49:27.100 --> 49:29.580
 So we're in these vacuum tube days.

49:29.580 --> 49:31.020
 Yeah, just entering them.

49:31.020 --> 49:32.860
 And just entering, wow.

49:32.860 --> 49:36.380
 Okay, so how do we escape the vacuum?

49:36.380 --> 49:37.580
 So how do we get to,

49:39.500 --> 49:42.140
 how do we get to where we are now with the CPU?

49:42.140 --> 49:44.700
 Is this a fundamental engineering challenge?

49:44.700 --> 49:49.020
 Is there breakthroughs on the physics side

49:49.020 --> 49:52.220
 that are needed on the computer science side?

49:53.180 --> 49:56.060
 Or is it a financial issue

49:56.060 --> 49:59.420
 where much larger just sheer investment

49:59.420 --> 50:01.020
 and excitement is needed?

50:01.020 --> 50:03.660
 So, you know, those are excellent questions.

50:03.660 --> 50:05.740
 My guess might, well, no, no.

50:05.740 --> 50:09.260
 My guess would be all of the above.

50:09.260 --> 50:11.020
 I mean, my guess, you know,

50:11.020 --> 50:13.420
 I mean, you could say fundamentally

50:13.420 --> 50:15.100
 it is an engineering issue, right?

50:15.100 --> 50:17.980
 The theory has been in place since the 90s.

50:17.980 --> 50:21.100
 You know, at least, you know, this is what,

50:21.100 --> 50:23.340
 you know, error correction would look like.

50:23.340 --> 50:25.420
 You know, we do not have the hardware

50:25.420 --> 50:26.780
 that is at that level.

50:26.780 --> 50:28.380
 But at the same time, you know,

50:28.380 --> 50:32.220
 so you could just, you know, try to power through,

50:32.220 --> 50:34.220
 you know, maybe even like, you know,

50:34.220 --> 50:36.540
 if someone spent a trillion dollars

50:36.540 --> 50:39.420
 on some quantum computing Manhattan project, right?

50:39.420 --> 50:43.020
 Then conceivably they could just, you know,

50:43.020 --> 50:46.540
 build an error corrected quantum computer

50:46.540 --> 50:49.580
 as it was envisioned back in the 90s, right?

50:49.580 --> 50:52.460
 I think the more plausible thing to happen

50:52.460 --> 50:55.420
 is that there will be further theoretical breakthroughs

50:55.420 --> 50:57.340
 and there will be further insights

50:57.340 --> 50:59.900
 that will cut down the cost of doing this.

50:59.900 --> 51:02.940
 So let's take a brief step to the philosophical.

51:02.940 --> 51:05.420
 I just recently talked to Jim Keller

51:05.420 --> 51:09.660
 who's sort of like the famed architect

51:09.660 --> 51:11.660
 in the microprocessor world.

51:12.220 --> 51:15.820
 And he's been told for decades,

51:16.380 --> 51:19.820
 every year that the Moore's law is going to die this year.

51:20.460 --> 51:24.220
 And he tries to argue that the Moore's law

51:24.220 --> 51:25.580
 is still alive and well,

51:25.580 --> 51:27.740
 and it'll be alive for quite a long time to come.

51:28.380 --> 51:29.020
 How long?

51:29.020 --> 51:30.060
 How long did he say?

51:30.060 --> 51:33.660
 Well, the main point is it's still alive,

51:33.660 --> 51:38.140
 but he thinks there's still a thousand X improvement

51:38.140 --> 51:40.380
 just on shrinking the transition that's possible.

51:40.940 --> 51:41.420
 Whatever.

51:41.420 --> 51:44.780
 The point is that the exponential growth we see

51:45.420 --> 51:49.100
 is actually a huge number of these S curves,

51:49.740 --> 51:51.100
 just constant breakthroughs.

51:51.660 --> 51:53.260
 At the philosophical level,

51:53.820 --> 51:57.980
 why do you think we as descendants of apes

51:57.980 --> 52:00.540
 were able to just keep coming up

52:00.540 --> 52:03.500
 with these new breakthroughs on the CPU side

52:03.500 --> 52:06.940
 is this something unique to this particular endeavor

52:06.940 --> 52:09.660
 or will it be possible to replicate

52:09.660 --> 52:11.100
 in the quantum computer space?

52:11.660 --> 52:11.980
 Okay.

52:11.980 --> 52:12.780
 All right.

52:12.780 --> 52:13.660
 There was a lot there,

52:15.340 --> 52:17.660
 but to break off something,

52:17.660 --> 52:20.860
 I mean, I think we are in an extremely special period

52:20.860 --> 52:22.460
 of human history, right?

52:22.460 --> 52:24.780
 I mean, it is, you could say,

52:24.780 --> 52:28.220
 obviously special in many ways, right?

52:28.220 --> 52:31.740
 There are way more people alive

52:31.740 --> 52:33.420
 than there have been

52:33.420 --> 52:39.740
 and the whole future of the planet

52:39.740 --> 52:43.660
 is in question in a way that it hasn't been

52:44.460 --> 52:46.620
 for the rest of human history.

52:46.620 --> 52:51.100
 But in particular, we are in the era

52:51.100 --> 52:53.900
 where we finally figured out

52:53.900 --> 52:57.580
 how to build universal machines,

52:57.580 --> 53:00.460
 you could say, the things that we call computers,

53:00.460 --> 53:04.780
 machines that you program to simulate the behavior

53:04.780 --> 53:06.460
 of whatever machine you want.

53:07.020 --> 53:13.420
 And once you've sort of crossed this threshold

53:13.420 --> 53:15.900
 of universality, you've built,

53:15.900 --> 53:17.260
 you could say, touring,

53:17.260 --> 53:19.500
 you've instantiated touring machines

53:19.500 --> 53:20.780
 in the physical world.

53:20.780 --> 53:23.900
 Well, then the main questions are ones of numbers.

53:23.900 --> 53:29.500
 They are ones of how much memory can you access?

53:29.500 --> 53:31.100
 How fast does it run?

53:31.100 --> 53:33.260
 How many parallel processors?

53:33.260 --> 53:34.780
 At least until quantum computing.

53:34.780 --> 53:36.300
 Quantum computing is the one thing

53:36.300 --> 53:38.540
 that changes what I just said, right?

53:38.540 --> 53:42.380
 But as long as it's classical computing,

53:42.380 --> 53:44.700
 then it's all questions of numbers.

53:44.700 --> 53:48.700
 And you could say at a theoretical level,

53:48.700 --> 53:50.380
 the computers that we have today

53:50.380 --> 53:52.620
 are the same as the ones in the 50s.

53:52.620 --> 53:55.500
 They're just millions of times faster

53:55.500 --> 53:57.260
 and with millions of times more memory.

53:57.260 --> 54:01.500
 And I think there's been an immense economic pressure

54:01.500 --> 54:04.220
 to get more and more transistors,

54:04.780 --> 54:06.300
 get them smaller and smaller,

54:07.100 --> 54:08.460
 add more and more cores.

54:09.020 --> 54:14.380
 And in some sense, a huge fraction

54:14.380 --> 54:16.780
 of all of the technological progress

54:16.780 --> 54:19.260
 that there is in all of civilization

54:19.260 --> 54:22.300
 has gotten concentrated just more narrowly

54:22.300 --> 54:24.860
 into just those problems, right?

54:24.860 --> 54:29.420
 And so it has been one of the biggest success stories

54:29.420 --> 54:31.260
 in the history of technology, right?

54:31.260 --> 54:34.620
 There's, I mean, it is, I am as amazed by it

54:34.620 --> 54:36.620
 as anyone else is, right?

54:36.620 --> 54:40.700
 But at the same time, we also know that it,

54:40.700 --> 54:45.340
 and I really do mean we know

54:45.340 --> 54:48.460
 that it cannot continue indefinitely, okay?

54:48.460 --> 54:52.220
 Because you will reach fundamental limits

54:52.220 --> 54:56.780
 on how small you can possibly make a processor.

54:56.780 --> 54:58.940
 And if you want a real proof

54:58.940 --> 55:01.340
 that would justify my use of the word,

55:01.340 --> 55:04.060
 we know that Moore's law has to end.

55:04.060 --> 55:06.300
 I mean, ultimately you will reach the limits

55:06.300 --> 55:07.820
 imposed by quantum gravity.

55:10.780 --> 55:12.540
 If you tried to build a computer

55:12.540 --> 55:15.580
 that operated at 10 to the 43 Hertz,

55:15.580 --> 55:18.620
 so did 10 to the 43 operations per second,

55:18.620 --> 55:20.780
 that computer would use so much energy

55:20.780 --> 55:24.380
 that it would simply collapse through a black hole, okay?

55:24.380 --> 55:28.620
 So in reality, we're going to reach the limits

55:28.620 --> 55:31.900
 long before that, but that is a sufficient proof.

55:31.900 --> 55:32.700
 That there's a limit.

55:33.420 --> 55:34.220
 Yes, yes.

55:35.820 --> 55:38.220
 But it would be interesting to try to understand

55:38.220 --> 55:40.860
 the mechanism, the economic pressure that you said,

55:40.860 --> 55:44.380
 just like the Cold War was a pressure on getting us,

55:44.380 --> 55:49.340
 getting us, because my us is both the Soviet Union

55:49.340 --> 55:52.380
 and the United States, but getting us,

55:52.380 --> 55:54.780
 the two countries to get to hurry up,

55:54.780 --> 55:56.300
 to get to space, to the moon,

55:56.300 --> 55:58.940
 there seems to be that same kind of economic pressure

55:58.940 --> 56:03.340
 that somehow created a chain of engineering breakthroughs

56:03.340 --> 56:05.580
 that resulted in the Moore's law.

56:05.580 --> 56:07.180
 And it'd be nice to replicate.

56:07.180 --> 56:09.180
 Yeah, well, I mean, some people are sort of,

56:10.380 --> 56:11.980
 get depressed about the fact

56:11.980 --> 56:16.540
 that technological progress may seem to have slowed down

56:16.540 --> 56:19.900
 in many, many realms outside of computing, right?

56:19.900 --> 56:22.620
 And there was this whole thing of we wanted flying cars

56:22.620 --> 56:24.620
 and we only got Twitter instead, right?

56:24.620 --> 56:27.260
 Yeah, good old Peter Thiel, yeah.

56:27.260 --> 56:28.700
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right, right.

56:28.700 --> 56:31.900
 So then jumping to another really interesting topic

56:31.900 --> 56:37.180
 that you mentioned, so Google announced with their work

56:37.180 --> 56:40.460
 in the paper in Nature with quantum supremacy.

56:40.460 --> 56:40.940
 Yes.

56:40.940 --> 56:43.820
 Can you describe, again, back to the basic,

56:43.820 --> 56:47.900
 what is perhaps not so basic, what is quantum supremacy?

56:47.900 --> 56:51.980
 Absolutely, so quantum supremacy is a term

56:51.980 --> 56:56.300
 that was coined by, again, by John Preskill in 2012.

56:57.580 --> 57:02.700
 Not everyone likes the name, but it sort of stuck.

57:04.220 --> 57:07.980
 We don't, we sort of haven't found a better alternative.

57:07.980 --> 57:10.460
 It's technically quantum computational supremacy.

57:10.460 --> 57:12.700
 Yeah, yeah, supremacy, that's right, that's right.

57:12.700 --> 57:16.220
 But the basic idea is actually one that goes all the way back

57:16.220 --> 57:18.460
 to the beginnings of quantum computing

57:18.460 --> 57:21.420
 when Richard Feynman and David Deutsch, people like that,

57:21.420 --> 57:23.260
 were talking about it in the early 80s.

57:24.940 --> 57:28.540
 And quantum supremacy just refers to sort of the point

57:28.540 --> 57:32.380
 in history when you can first use a quantum computer

57:32.380 --> 57:36.380
 to do some well defined task much faster

57:36.380 --> 57:40.460
 than any known algorithm running on any of the classical computers

57:40.460 --> 57:42.220
 that are available, okay?

57:42.220 --> 57:45.820
 So notice that I did not say a useful task, okay?

57:46.540 --> 57:48.940
 It could be something completely artificial,

57:48.940 --> 57:51.740
 but it's important that the task be well defined.

57:51.740 --> 57:55.980
 So in other words, it is something that has right and wrong answers

57:57.100 --> 58:00.460
 that are knowable independently of this device, right?

58:00.460 --> 58:04.300
 And we can then run the device, see if it gets the right answer or not.

58:04.300 --> 58:05.900
 Can you clarify a small point?

58:05.900 --> 58:08.700
 You said much faster than a classical implementation.

58:09.420 --> 58:13.580
 What about sort of what about the space with where the class,

58:13.580 --> 58:16.300
 there's no, there's not, it doesn't even exist,

58:16.300 --> 58:18.780
 a classical algorithm to show the power?

58:18.780 --> 58:20.460
 So maybe I should clarify.

58:20.460 --> 58:22.940
 Everything that a quantum computer can do,

58:22.940 --> 58:26.700
 a classical computer can also eventually do, okay?

58:26.700 --> 58:31.340
 And the reason why we know that is that a classical computer

58:31.340 --> 58:35.500
 could always, you know, if it had no limits of time and memory,

58:35.500 --> 58:39.180
 it could always just store the entire quantum state,

58:39.180 --> 58:41.420
 you know, of your, you know, of the quantum,

58:41.420 --> 58:44.780
 store a list of all the amplitudes,

58:44.780 --> 58:47.260
 you know, in the state of the quantum computer,

58:47.260 --> 58:50.060
 and then just, you know, do some linear algebra

58:50.060 --> 58:52.140
 to just update that state, right?

58:52.140 --> 58:55.420
 And so anything that quantum computers can do

58:55.420 --> 58:58.300
 can also be done by classical computers,

58:58.300 --> 59:00.620
 albeit exponentially slower in some cases.

59:00.620 --> 59:03.740
 So quantum computers don't go into some magical place

59:03.740 --> 59:06.620
 outside of Alan Turing's definition of computation.

59:06.620 --> 59:07.420
 Precisely.

59:07.420 --> 59:09.900
 They do not solve the halting problem.

59:09.900 --> 59:12.620
 They cannot solve anything that is uncomputable

59:12.620 --> 59:14.300
 in Alan Turing's sense.

59:14.300 --> 59:16.620
 What we think they do change

59:16.620 --> 59:19.260
 is what is efficiently computable, okay?

59:19.260 --> 59:22.220
 And, you know, since the 1960s, you know,

59:22.220 --> 59:23.980
 the word efficiently, you know,

59:23.980 --> 59:26.780
 as well has been a central word in computer science,

59:26.780 --> 59:29.900
 but it's sort of a code word for something technical,

59:29.900 --> 59:33.740
 which is basically with polynomial scaling, you know,

59:33.740 --> 59:36.700
 that as you get to larger and larger inputs,

59:36.700 --> 59:39.580
 you would like an algorithm that uses an amount of time

59:39.580 --> 59:42.220
 that scales only like the size of the input

59:42.220 --> 59:43.740
 raised to some power

59:43.740 --> 59:47.180
 and not exponentially with the size of the input, right?

59:47.180 --> 59:49.740
 Yeah, so I do hope we get to talk again

59:49.740 --> 59:52.540
 because one of the many topics

59:52.540 --> 59:55.820
 that there's probably several hours worth of conversation on

59:55.820 --> 59:56.620
 is complexity,

59:56.620 --> 1:00:00.300
 which we probably won't even get a chance to touch today,

1:00:00.300 --> 1:00:02.060
 but you briefly mentioned it,

1:00:02.620 --> 1:00:05.260
 but let's maybe try to continue.

1:00:05.260 --> 1:00:08.540
 So you said the definition of quantum supremacy

1:00:08.540 --> 1:00:12.380
 is basically achieving a place

1:00:12.380 --> 1:00:14.300
 where much faster on a formal,

1:00:14.940 --> 1:00:16.460
 that quantum computer is much faster

1:00:16.460 --> 1:00:18.540
 on a formal well defined problem

1:00:19.340 --> 1:00:21.100
 that is or isn't useful.

1:00:21.100 --> 1:00:22.300
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right.

1:00:22.300 --> 1:00:25.260
 And I would say that we really want three things, right?

1:00:25.260 --> 1:00:26.860
 We want, first of all,

1:00:26.860 --> 1:00:29.260
 the quantum computer to be much faster

1:00:29.260 --> 1:00:31.980
 just in the literal sense of like number of seconds,

1:00:31.980 --> 1:00:34.540
 you know, it's a solving this, you know,

1:00:34.540 --> 1:00:36.940
 well defined, you know, problem.

1:00:36.940 --> 1:00:40.540
 Secondly, we want it to be sort of, you know,

1:00:40.540 --> 1:00:42.700
 for a problem where we really believe

1:00:42.700 --> 1:00:45.980
 that a quantum computer has better scaling behavior, right?

1:00:45.980 --> 1:00:48.780
 So it's not just an incidental, you know,

1:00:48.780 --> 1:00:50.060
 matter of hardware,

1:00:50.060 --> 1:00:51.180
 but it's that, you know,

1:00:51.180 --> 1:00:53.900
 as you went to larger and larger inputs,

1:00:53.900 --> 1:00:57.180
 you know, the classical scaling would be exponential

1:00:57.180 --> 1:00:59.660
 and the scaling for the quantum algorithm

1:00:59.660 --> 1:01:01.500
 would only be polynomial.

1:01:01.500 --> 1:01:04.060
 And then thirdly, we want the first thing,

1:01:04.060 --> 1:01:06.220
 the actual observed speed up

1:01:06.220 --> 1:01:10.620
 to only be explainable in terms of the scaling behavior, right?

1:01:10.620 --> 1:01:12.700
 So, you know, I want, you know,

1:01:12.700 --> 1:01:15.740
 a real world, you know, a real problem to get solved,

1:01:16.460 --> 1:01:20.460
 let's say by a quantum computer with 50 qubits or so,

1:01:20.460 --> 1:01:23.580
 and for no one to be able to explain that in any way

1:01:23.580 --> 1:01:30.300
 other than, well, you know, this computer involved a quantum state

1:01:30.300 --> 1:01:33.180
 with two to the 50th power amplitudes.

1:01:33.180 --> 1:01:35.180
 And, you know, a classical simulation,

1:01:35.180 --> 1:01:37.100
 at least any that we know today,

1:01:37.100 --> 1:01:40.460
 would require keeping track of two to the 50th numbers.

1:01:40.460 --> 1:01:42.380
 And this is the reason why it was faster.

1:01:42.380 --> 1:01:46.700
 So the intuition is that then if you demonstrate on 50 qubits,

1:01:46.700 --> 1:01:48.300
 then once you get to 100 qubits,

1:01:48.300 --> 1:01:50.780
 then it'll be even much more faster.

1:01:50.780 --> 1:01:52.460
 Precisely, precisely.

1:01:52.460 --> 1:01:55.020
 Yeah, and, you know, and quantum supremacy

1:01:55.020 --> 1:01:57.100
 does not require error correction, right?

1:01:57.100 --> 1:01:58.860
 We don't, you know, we don't have, you could say,

1:01:58.860 --> 1:02:04.540
 true scalability yet or true, you know, error correction yet.

1:02:04.540 --> 1:02:08.860
 But you could say quantum supremacy is already enough by itself

1:02:08.860 --> 1:02:12.140
 to refute the skeptics who said a quantum computer

1:02:12.140 --> 1:02:15.260
 will never outperform a classical computer for anything.

1:02:15.260 --> 1:02:20.460
 But one, how do you demonstrate quantum supremacy?

1:02:20.460 --> 1:02:23.740
 And two, what's up with these news articles

1:02:23.740 --> 1:02:25.820
 I'm reading that Google did so?

1:02:25.820 --> 1:02:28.860
 Yeah, all right, well, great, great questions,

1:02:28.860 --> 1:02:31.900
 because now you get into actually, you know,

1:02:31.900 --> 1:02:34.140
 a lot of the work that I've, you know,

1:02:34.140 --> 1:02:36.940
 I and my students have been doing for the last decade,

1:02:36.940 --> 1:02:41.020
 which was precisely about how do you demonstrate

1:02:41.020 --> 1:02:44.220
 quantum supremacy using technologies that, you know,

1:02:44.220 --> 1:02:47.100
 we thought would be available in the near future.

1:02:47.100 --> 1:02:53.740
 And so one of the main things that we realized around 2011,

1:02:53.740 --> 1:02:59.900
 and this was me and my student, Alex Arkhipov at MIT at the time,

1:02:59.900 --> 1:03:03.180
 and independently of some others,

1:03:03.180 --> 1:03:06.220
 including Bremner, Joseph, and Shepherd, okay?

1:03:06.220 --> 1:03:10.940
 And the realization that we came to was that

1:03:10.940 --> 1:03:14.860
 if you just want to prove that a quantum computer is faster,

1:03:14.860 --> 1:03:17.260
 you know, and not do something useful with it,

1:03:17.260 --> 1:03:20.300
 then there are huge advantages to sort of switching

1:03:20.300 --> 1:03:23.900
 your attention from problems like factoring numbers

1:03:23.900 --> 1:03:26.060
 that have a single right answer

1:03:26.060 --> 1:03:28.540
 to what we call sampling problems.

1:03:28.540 --> 1:03:31.980
 So these are problems where the goal is just to output

1:03:31.980 --> 1:03:35.420
 a sample from some probability distribution,

1:03:35.420 --> 1:03:38.060
 let's say over strings of 50 bits, right?

1:03:38.060 --> 1:03:40.060
 So there are, you know, many, many,

1:03:40.060 --> 1:03:42.060
 many possible valid outputs.

1:03:42.060 --> 1:03:44.540
 You know, your computer will probably never even produce

1:03:44.540 --> 1:03:46.540
 the same output twice, you know,

1:03:46.540 --> 1:03:50.620
 if it's running as, even, you know,

1:03:50.620 --> 1:03:52.780
 assuming it's running perfectly, okay?

1:03:52.780 --> 1:03:55.660
 But the key is that some outputs are supposed

1:03:55.660 --> 1:03:57.740
 to be likelier than other ones.

1:03:57.740 --> 1:04:01.980
 So, sorry, to clarify, is there a set of outputs

1:04:01.980 --> 1:04:03.740
 that are valid and set they're not,

1:04:03.740 --> 1:04:06.940
 or is it more that the distribution

1:04:07.980 --> 1:04:11.420
 of a particular kind of output is more,

1:04:11.420 --> 1:04:13.260
 is like there's a specific distribution

1:04:13.260 --> 1:04:14.860
 of a particular kind of output?

1:04:14.860 --> 1:04:16.540
 Yeah, there's a specific distribution

1:04:16.540 --> 1:04:17.980
 that you're trying to hit, right?

1:04:17.980 --> 1:04:19.980
 Or, you know, that you're trying to sample from.

1:04:19.980 --> 1:04:22.460
 Now, there are a lot of questions about this,

1:04:22.460 --> 1:04:24.540
 you know, how do you do that, right?

1:04:24.540 --> 1:04:27.660
 Now, how you do it, you know,

1:04:27.660 --> 1:04:30.220
 it turns out that with a quantum computer,

1:04:30.220 --> 1:04:32.220
 even with the noisy quantum computers

1:04:32.220 --> 1:04:34.780
 that we have now, that we have today,

1:04:34.780 --> 1:04:36.940
 what you can do is basically just apply

1:04:36.940 --> 1:04:40.220
 a randomly chosen sequence of operations, right?

1:04:40.220 --> 1:04:42.380
 So we, you know, in some of the, you know,

1:04:42.380 --> 1:04:44.540
 that part is almost trivial, right?

1:04:44.540 --> 1:04:47.260
 We just sort of get the qubits to interact

1:04:47.260 --> 1:04:48.540
 in some random way,

1:04:48.540 --> 1:04:51.580
 although a sort of precisely specified random way

1:04:51.580 --> 1:04:54.940
 so we can repeat the exact same random sequence

1:04:54.940 --> 1:04:57.580
 of interactions again and get another sample

1:04:57.580 --> 1:04:59.500
 from that same distribution.

1:04:59.500 --> 1:05:01.820
 And what this does is it basically,

1:05:01.820 --> 1:05:04.060
 well, it creates a lot of garbage,

1:05:04.060 --> 1:05:06.620
 but, you know, very specific garbage, right?

1:05:06.620 --> 1:05:09.100
 So, you know, of all of the,

1:05:09.100 --> 1:05:11.340
 so we're gonna talk about Google's device

1:05:11.340 --> 1:05:14.060
 that were 53 qubits there, okay?

1:05:14.060 --> 1:05:18.060
 And so there were two to the 53 power possible outputs.

1:05:18.060 --> 1:05:19.980
 Now, for some of those outputs,

1:05:19.980 --> 1:05:22.540
 you know, there was a little bit more

1:05:22.540 --> 1:05:25.660
 destructive interference in their amplitude, okay?

1:05:25.660 --> 1:05:28.060
 So their amplitudes were a little bit smaller.

1:05:28.060 --> 1:05:29.500
 And for others, there was a little more

1:05:29.500 --> 1:05:31.180
 constructive interference.

1:05:31.180 --> 1:05:32.860
 You know, the amplitudes were a little bit

1:05:32.860 --> 1:05:35.180
 more aligned with each other, you know,

1:05:35.180 --> 1:05:38.860
 and so those were a little bit likelier, okay?

1:05:38.860 --> 1:05:42.140
 All of the outputs are exponentially unlikely,

1:05:42.140 --> 1:05:45.340
 but some are, let's say, two times or three times,

1:05:45.340 --> 1:05:47.740
 you know, unlikelier than others, okay?

1:05:47.740 --> 1:05:50.700
 And so you can define, you know,

1:05:50.700 --> 1:05:53.500
 this sequence of operations that gives rise

1:05:53.500 --> 1:05:55.660
 to this probability distribution.

1:05:55.660 --> 1:05:58.700
 Okay, now the next question would be,

1:05:58.700 --> 1:05:59.660
 well, how do you, you know,

1:05:59.660 --> 1:06:01.020
 even if you're sampling from it,

1:06:01.020 --> 1:06:02.460
 how do you verify that, right?

1:06:02.460 --> 1:06:04.060
 How do you know?

1:06:04.060 --> 1:06:06.780
 And so my students and I,

1:06:06.780 --> 1:06:09.260
 and also the people at Google

1:06:09.260 --> 1:06:10.380
 were doing the experiment,

1:06:10.380 --> 1:06:12.940
 came up with statistical tests

1:06:12.940 --> 1:06:14.940
 that you can apply to the outputs

1:06:15.900 --> 1:06:20.620
 in order to try to verify, you know,

1:06:20.620 --> 1:06:22.620
 what is, you know, that at least

1:06:22.620 --> 1:06:25.100
 that some hard problem is being solved.

1:06:25.900 --> 1:06:27.900
 The test that Google ended up using

1:06:28.620 --> 1:06:29.820
 was something that they called

1:06:29.820 --> 1:06:32.780
 the linear cross entropy benchmark, okay?

1:06:32.780 --> 1:06:34.220
 And it's basically, you know,

1:06:34.220 --> 1:06:36.300
 so the drawback of this test

1:06:36.300 --> 1:06:38.140
 is that it requires, like,

1:06:38.140 --> 1:06:43.020
 it requires you to do a two to the 53 time calculation

1:06:43.020 --> 1:06:44.860
 with your classical computer, okay?

1:06:44.860 --> 1:06:47.740
 So it's very expensive to do the test

1:06:47.740 --> 1:06:49.260
 on a classical computer.

1:06:49.260 --> 1:06:49.900
 The good news is...

1:06:49.900 --> 1:06:51.660
 How big of a number is two to the 53?

1:06:51.660 --> 1:06:53.820
 It's about nine quadrillion, okay?

1:06:53.820 --> 1:06:54.460
 That doesn't help.

1:06:55.100 --> 1:06:55.820
 Well, you know,

1:06:55.820 --> 1:06:58.380
 it's, you want it in like scientific notation.

1:06:58.380 --> 1:06:59.660
 No, no, no, what I mean is...

1:06:59.660 --> 1:07:01.020
 Yeah, it is just...

1:07:01.020 --> 1:07:02.860
 It's impossible to run on a...

1:07:02.860 --> 1:07:04.780
 Yeah, so we will come back to that.

1:07:04.780 --> 1:07:07.420
 It is just barely possible to run,

1:07:07.420 --> 1:07:09.260
 we think, on the largest supercomputer

1:07:09.260 --> 1:07:10.940
 that currently exists on Earth,

1:07:10.940 --> 1:07:14.220
 which is called Summit at Oak Ridge National Lab, okay?

1:07:15.340 --> 1:07:16.780
 Great, this is exciting.

1:07:16.780 --> 1:07:18.220
 That's the short answer.

1:07:18.220 --> 1:07:21.900
 So ironically, for this type of experiment,

1:07:21.900 --> 1:07:24.300
 we don't want 100 qubits, okay?

1:07:24.300 --> 1:07:26.940
 Because with 100 qubits, even if it works,

1:07:26.940 --> 1:07:29.580
 we don't know how to verify the results, okay?

1:07:29.580 --> 1:07:32.060
 So we want, you know, a number of qubits

1:07:32.060 --> 1:07:33.100
 that is enough that, you know,

1:07:33.100 --> 1:07:36.300
 the biggest classical computers on Earth

1:07:36.300 --> 1:07:38.140
 will have to sweat, you know,

1:07:38.140 --> 1:07:39.980
 and we'll just barely, you know,

1:07:39.980 --> 1:07:42.700
 be able to keep up with the quantum computer,

1:07:42.700 --> 1:07:44.460
 you know, using much more time,

1:07:44.460 --> 1:07:46.540
 but they will still be able to do it

1:07:46.540 --> 1:07:48.300
 in order that we can verify the results.

1:07:48.300 --> 1:07:50.540
 Which is where the 53 comes from for the number of qubits?

1:07:50.540 --> 1:07:53.180
 Basically, well, I mean, that's also,

1:07:53.180 --> 1:07:54.300
 that's sort of, you know,

1:07:55.420 --> 1:07:58.780
 I mean, that's sort of where they are now

1:07:58.780 --> 1:08:00.380
 in terms of scaling, you know?

1:08:00.380 --> 1:08:03.100
 And then, you know, soon, you know, that point will be passed.

1:08:03.660 --> 1:08:06.780
 And then when you get to larger numbers of qubits,

1:08:06.780 --> 1:08:10.060
 then, you know, these types of sampling experiments

1:08:10.060 --> 1:08:12.140
 will no longer be so interesting

1:08:12.140 --> 1:08:14.860
 because we won't even be able to verify the results

1:08:14.860 --> 1:08:17.740
 and we'll have to switch to other types of computation.

1:08:17.740 --> 1:08:19.660
 So with the sampling thing,

1:08:19.660 --> 1:08:22.460
 you know, so the test that Google applied

1:08:22.460 --> 1:08:24.700
 with this linear cross entropy benchmark

1:08:24.700 --> 1:08:28.460
 was basically just take the samples that were generated,

1:08:28.460 --> 1:08:30.780
 which are, you know, a very small subset

1:08:30.780 --> 1:08:32.940
 of all the possible samples that there are.

1:08:32.940 --> 1:08:36.540
 But for those, you calculate with your classical computer

1:08:36.540 --> 1:08:38.940
 the probabilities that they should have been output.

1:08:39.500 --> 1:08:41.500
 And you see, are those probabilities

1:08:41.500 --> 1:08:43.020
 like larger than the mean?

1:08:43.020 --> 1:08:45.260
 You know, so is the quantum computer biased

1:08:45.260 --> 1:08:47.500
 toward outputting the strings that it's,

1:08:47.500 --> 1:08:50.300
 you know, that you want it to be biased toward?

1:08:50.300 --> 1:08:51.980
 Okay, and then finally,

1:08:51.980 --> 1:08:54.220
 we come to a very crucial question,

1:08:54.220 --> 1:08:56.140
 which is supposing that it does that.

1:08:56.140 --> 1:08:58.380
 Well, how do we know that a classical computer

1:08:58.380 --> 1:09:01.260
 could not have quickly done the same thing, right?

1:09:01.260 --> 1:09:02.380
 How do we know that, you know,

1:09:02.380 --> 1:09:05.500
 this couldn't have been spoofed by a classical computer, right?

1:09:05.500 --> 1:09:09.820
 And so, well, the first answer is we don't know for sure

1:09:09.820 --> 1:09:11.180
 because, you know, this takes us

1:09:11.180 --> 1:09:13.740
 into questions of complexity theory.

1:09:13.740 --> 1:09:17.740
 You know, I mean, questions of the magnitude

1:09:17.740 --> 1:09:20.380
 of the P versus NP question and things like that, right?

1:09:20.380 --> 1:09:23.500
 You know, we don't know how to rule out definitively

1:09:23.500 --> 1:09:26.540
 that there could be fast classical algorithms

1:09:26.540 --> 1:09:28.940
 for, you know, even simulating quantum mechanics

1:09:28.940 --> 1:09:32.300
 and for, you know, simulating experiments like these,

1:09:32.300 --> 1:09:36.140
 but we can give some evidence against that possibility.

1:09:36.140 --> 1:09:37.980
 And that was sort of the, you know,

1:09:37.980 --> 1:09:40.140
 the main thrust of a lot of the work

1:09:40.140 --> 1:09:42.540
 that my colleagues and I did, you know,

1:09:42.540 --> 1:09:43.660
 over the last decade,

1:09:43.660 --> 1:09:46.780
 which is then sort of in around 2015 or so,

1:09:46.780 --> 1:09:49.900
 what led to Google deciding to do this experiment.

1:09:49.900 --> 1:09:52.540
 So is the kind of evidence here,

1:09:52.540 --> 1:09:55.820
 first of all, the hard P equals NP problem that you mentioned

1:09:55.820 --> 1:10:00.780
 and the kind of evidence that you were looking at,

1:10:00.780 --> 1:10:03.740
 is that something you come to on a sheet of paper

1:10:03.740 --> 1:10:07.420
 or is this something, are these empirical experiments?

1:10:07.420 --> 1:10:09.500
 It's math for the most part.

1:10:09.500 --> 1:10:12.700
 I mean, you know, it's also, you know,

1:10:12.700 --> 1:10:15.740
 we have a bunch of methods

1:10:15.740 --> 1:10:19.980
 that are known for simulating quantum circuits

1:10:19.980 --> 1:10:23.500
 or quantum computations with classical computers.

1:10:23.500 --> 1:10:25.260
 And so we have to try them all out

1:10:25.260 --> 1:10:27.500
 and make sure that, you know, they don't work,

1:10:27.500 --> 1:10:30.220
 you know, make sure that they have exponential scaling

1:10:30.220 --> 1:10:34.140
 on, you know, these problems and not just theoretically,

1:10:34.140 --> 1:10:36.300
 but with the actual range of parameters

1:10:36.300 --> 1:10:40.300
 that are actually, you know, arising in Google's experiment.

1:10:40.300 --> 1:10:43.340
 Okay, so there is an empirical component to it, right?

1:10:43.340 --> 1:10:47.100
 But now on the theoretical side,

1:10:47.100 --> 1:10:49.740
 you know, basically what we know how to do

1:10:49.740 --> 1:10:53.580
 in theoretical computer science and computational complexity

1:10:53.580 --> 1:10:56.060
 is, you know, we don't know how to prove

1:10:56.060 --> 1:10:58.780
 that most of the problems we care about are hard,

1:10:58.780 --> 1:11:01.900
 but we know how to pass the blame to someone else, okay?

1:11:01.900 --> 1:11:03.980
 We know how to say, well, look, you know,

1:11:03.980 --> 1:11:06.300
 I can't prove that this problem is hard,

1:11:06.300 --> 1:11:08.860
 but if it is easy, then all these other things

1:11:08.860 --> 1:11:13.020
 that, you know, you probably were much more confident

1:11:13.020 --> 1:11:16.780
 or were hard, then those would be easy as well, okay?

1:11:16.780 --> 1:11:19.660
 So we can give what are called reductions.

1:11:19.660 --> 1:11:22.700
 This has been the basic strategy in, you know,

1:11:22.700 --> 1:11:27.420
 NP completeness, right, in all of theoretical computer science

1:11:27.420 --> 1:11:31.020
 and cryptography since the 1970s, really.

1:11:31.020 --> 1:11:34.300
 And so we were able to give some reduction evidence

1:11:34.300 --> 1:11:40.140
 for the hardness of simulating these sampling experiments,

1:11:40.140 --> 1:11:43.100
 these sampling based quantum supremacy experiments.

1:11:43.100 --> 1:11:47.260
 So reduction evidence is not as satisfactory as it should be.

1:11:47.260 --> 1:11:49.900
 One of the biggest open problems in this area

1:11:49.900 --> 1:11:51.420
 is to make it better.

1:11:51.420 --> 1:11:53.260
 But, you know, we can do something.

1:11:53.260 --> 1:11:56.700
 You know, certainly we can say that, you know,

1:11:56.700 --> 1:11:59.340
 if there is a fast classical algorithm

1:11:59.340 --> 1:12:02.220
 to spoof these experiments, then it has to be very,

1:12:02.220 --> 1:12:04.620
 very unlike any of the algorithms that we know.

1:12:04.620 --> 1:12:08.940
 TREVOR Which is kind of in the same kind

1:12:08.940 --> 1:12:12.700
 of space of reasoning that people say P not equals NP.

1:12:12.700 --> 1:12:17.500
 BENJAMIN Yeah, it's in the same spirit.

1:12:17.500 --> 1:12:22.220
 TREVOR Okay, so Andrew Yang, a very intelligent

1:12:22.220 --> 1:12:27.420
 and a presidential candidate with a lot of interesting ideas

1:12:27.420 --> 1:12:31.980
 in all kinds of technological fields, tweeted that

1:12:31.980 --> 1:12:35.180
 because of quantum computing, no code is uncrackable.

1:12:36.060 --> 1:12:37.980
 Is he wrong or right?

1:12:37.980 --> 1:12:40.860
 BENJAMIN He was premature, let's say.

1:12:40.860 --> 1:12:42.540
 So, well, okay, wrong.

1:12:45.020 --> 1:12:49.500
 Look, I'm actually, you know, I'm a fan of Andrew Yang.

1:12:49.500 --> 1:12:51.580
 I like his ideas.

1:12:51.580 --> 1:12:52.780
 I like his candidacy.

1:12:53.820 --> 1:12:58.140
 I think that, you know, he may be ahead of his time

1:12:58.140 --> 1:13:01.660
 with, you know, the universal basic income and so forth.

1:13:01.660 --> 1:13:04.700
 And he may also be ahead of his time in that tweet

1:13:04.700 --> 1:13:05.980
 that you referenced.

1:13:05.980 --> 1:13:09.420
 So regarding using quantum computers

1:13:09.420 --> 1:13:13.260
 to break cryptography, so the situation is this, okay?

1:13:13.260 --> 1:13:18.940
 So the famous discovery of Peter Shor, you know, 26 years ago

1:13:18.940 --> 1:13:21.340
 that really started quantum computing, you know,

1:13:21.340 --> 1:13:26.140
 as an autonomous field was that if you built a full

1:13:26.140 --> 1:13:29.660
 scalable quantum computer, then you could use it

1:13:29.660 --> 1:13:35.180
 to efficiently find the prime factors of huge numbers

1:13:35.180 --> 1:13:38.860
 and calculate discrete logarithms and solve

1:13:38.860 --> 1:13:41.820
 a few other problems that are very, very special

1:13:41.820 --> 1:13:42.860
 in character, right?

1:13:42.860 --> 1:13:44.780
 They're not NP complete problems.

1:13:44.780 --> 1:13:46.460
 We're pretty sure they're not, okay?

1:13:46.460 --> 1:13:52.060
 But it so happens that most of the public key cryptography

1:13:52.060 --> 1:13:54.380
 that we currently use to protect the internet

1:13:54.380 --> 1:13:57.660
 is based on the belief that these problems are hard.

1:13:57.660 --> 1:13:59.900
 Okay, what Shor showed is that once you get

1:13:59.900 --> 1:14:03.260
 scalable quantum computers, then that's no longer true, okay?

1:14:03.260 --> 1:14:06.860
 But now, you know, before people panic,

1:14:06.860 --> 1:14:09.740
 there are two important points to understand here.

1:14:09.740 --> 1:14:13.180
 Okay, the first is that quantum supremacy,

1:14:13.180 --> 1:14:15.740
 the milestone that Google just achieved,

1:14:15.740 --> 1:14:19.660
 is very, very far from the kind of scalable quantum computer

1:14:19.660 --> 1:14:21.900
 that would be needed to actually threaten

1:14:21.900 --> 1:14:23.500
 public key cryptography.

1:14:23.500 --> 1:14:25.740
 Okay, so, you know, we touched on this earlier, right?

1:14:25.740 --> 1:14:29.740
 But Google's device has 53 physical qubits, right?

1:14:29.740 --> 1:14:33.020
 To threaten cryptography, you're talking, you know,

1:14:33.020 --> 1:14:35.020
 with any of the known error correction methods,

1:14:35.020 --> 1:14:37.420
 you're talking millions of physical qubits.

1:14:37.420 --> 1:14:39.660
 Because error correction would be required

1:14:39.660 --> 1:14:40.860
 to threaten cryptography.

1:14:40.860 --> 1:14:46.860
 Yes, yes, yes, it certainly would, right?

1:14:46.860 --> 1:14:51.020
 And, you know, how much, you know,

1:14:51.020 --> 1:14:53.820
 how great will the overhead be from the error correction?

1:14:53.820 --> 1:14:55.180
 That we don't know yet.

1:14:55.180 --> 1:14:58.860
 But with the known codes, you're talking millions

1:14:58.860 --> 1:15:01.580
 of physical qubits and of a much higher quality

1:15:01.580 --> 1:15:03.260
 than any that we have now, okay?

1:15:03.260 --> 1:15:07.900
 So, you know, I don't think that that is, you know,

1:15:07.900 --> 1:15:12.060
 coming soon, although people who have secrets

1:15:12.060 --> 1:15:15.420
 that, you know, need to stay secret for 20 years,

1:15:15.420 --> 1:15:17.740
 you know, are already worried about this,

1:15:17.740 --> 1:15:19.900
 you know, for the good reason that, you know,

1:15:19.900 --> 1:15:22.620
 we presume that intelligence agencies

1:15:22.620 --> 1:15:25.260
 are already scooping up data, you know,

1:15:25.260 --> 1:15:27.980
 in the hope that eventually they'll be able to decode it

1:15:27.980 --> 1:15:30.780
 once quantum computers become available, okay?

1:15:30.780 --> 1:15:35.580
 So this brings me to the second point I wanted to make,

1:15:35.580 --> 1:15:39.420
 which is that there are other public key cryptosystems

1:15:39.420 --> 1:15:43.260
 that are known that we don't know how to break

1:15:43.260 --> 1:15:45.420
 even with quantum computers, okay?

1:15:45.420 --> 1:15:48.460
 And so there's a whole field devoted to this now,

1:15:48.460 --> 1:15:51.660
 which is called post quantum cryptography, okay?

1:15:51.660 --> 1:15:55.580
 And so there is already, so we have some good candidates now.

1:15:56.300 --> 1:15:58.460
 The best known being what are called

1:15:58.460 --> 1:16:00.620
 lattice based cryptosystems.

1:16:00.620 --> 1:16:03.500
 And there is already some push to try to migrate

1:16:03.500 --> 1:16:04.780
 to these cryptosystems.

1:16:04.780 --> 1:16:09.900
 So NIST in the US is holding a competition

1:16:09.900 --> 1:16:13.420
 to create standards for post quantum cryptography,

1:16:13.980 --> 1:16:16.460
 which will be the first step in trying to get

1:16:16.460 --> 1:16:20.380
 every web browser and every router to upgrade,

1:16:20.380 --> 1:16:23.660
 you know, and use, you know, something like SSL

1:16:23.660 --> 1:16:26.220
 that would be based on, you know,

1:16:26.220 --> 1:16:29.340
 what we think is quantum secure cryptography.

1:16:29.340 --> 1:16:31.660
 But, you know, this will be a long process.

1:16:33.340 --> 1:16:35.180
 But, you know, it is something that people

1:16:35.180 --> 1:16:36.780
 are already starting to do.

1:16:36.780 --> 1:16:40.300
 And so, you know, I'm sure this algorithm

1:16:40.300 --> 1:16:42.780
 is sort of a dramatic discovery.

1:16:42.780 --> 1:16:44.220
 You know, it could be a big deal

1:16:44.220 --> 1:16:46.220
 for whatever intelligence agency

1:16:46.220 --> 1:16:48.780
 first gets a scalable quantum computer,

1:16:48.780 --> 1:16:51.260
 if no, at least certainly if no one else

1:16:51.260 --> 1:16:52.860
 knows that they have it, right?

1:16:53.580 --> 1:16:57.740
 But eventually we think that we could migrate

1:16:57.740 --> 1:17:00.380
 the internet to the post quantum cryptography

1:17:00.380 --> 1:17:03.340
 and then we'd be more or less back where we started.

1:17:03.340 --> 1:17:06.060
 Okay, so this is sort of not the application

1:17:06.060 --> 1:17:07.180
 of quantum computing.

1:17:07.180 --> 1:17:09.340
 I think that's really gonna change the world

1:17:09.340 --> 1:17:10.860
 in a sustainable way, right?

1:17:10.860 --> 1:17:14.140
 The big, by the way, the biggest practical application

1:17:14.140 --> 1:17:17.340
 of quantum computing that we know about by far,

1:17:17.340 --> 1:17:19.420
 I think is simply the simulation

1:17:19.420 --> 1:17:21.340
 of quantum mechanics itself.

1:17:21.340 --> 1:17:24.780
 In order to, you know, learn about chemical reactions,

1:17:24.780 --> 1:17:28.380
 you know, design maybe new chemical processes,

1:17:28.380 --> 1:17:32.700
 new materials, new drugs, new solar cells,

1:17:32.700 --> 1:17:35.660
 new superconductors, all kinds of things like that.

1:17:35.660 --> 1:17:37.660
 What's the size of a quantum computer

1:17:38.700 --> 1:17:41.820
 that would be able to simulate the,

1:17:41.820 --> 1:17:43.900
 you know, quantum mechanical systems themselves

1:17:44.700 --> 1:17:46.780
 that would be impactful for the real world

1:17:46.780 --> 1:17:49.500
 for the kind of chemical reactions

1:17:49.500 --> 1:17:50.540
 and that kind of work?

1:17:50.540 --> 1:17:51.900
 What scale are we talking about?

1:17:51.900 --> 1:17:55.820
 Now you're asking a very, very current question,

1:17:55.820 --> 1:17:56.940
 a very big question.

1:17:57.740 --> 1:18:00.940
 People are going to be racing over the next decade

1:18:00.940 --> 1:18:04.140
 to try to do useful quantum simulations

1:18:04.780 --> 1:18:09.100
 even with, you know, 100 or 200 qubit quantum computers

1:18:09.100 --> 1:18:11.500
 of the sort that we expect to be able to build

1:18:11.500 --> 1:18:12.860
 over the next decade.

1:18:12.860 --> 1:18:15.580
 Okay, so that might be, you know,

1:18:15.580 --> 1:18:18.460
 the first application of quantum computing

1:18:18.460 --> 1:18:20.380
 that we're able to realize, you know,

1:18:20.380 --> 1:18:23.100
 or maybe it will prove to be too difficult

1:18:23.100 --> 1:18:26.060
 and maybe even that will require fault tolerance

1:18:26.060 --> 1:18:28.300
 or, you know, will require error correction.

1:18:28.300 --> 1:18:30.460
 So there's an aggressive race to come up

1:18:30.460 --> 1:18:33.900
 with the one case study kind of like Peter Schor

1:18:35.500 --> 1:18:37.260
 with the idea that would just capture

1:18:37.260 --> 1:18:38.860
 the world's imagination of like,

1:18:38.860 --> 1:18:41.820
 look, we can actually do something very useful here.

1:18:41.820 --> 1:18:44.140
 Right, but I think, you know, within the next decade,

1:18:44.140 --> 1:18:46.700
 the best shot we have is certainly not,

1:18:46.700 --> 1:18:50.860
 you know, using Schor's algorithm to break cryptography,

1:18:50.860 --> 1:18:53.020
 you know, just because it requires,

1:18:53.020 --> 1:18:55.740
 you know, too much in the way of error correction.

1:18:55.740 --> 1:18:59.820
 The best shot we have is to do some quantum simulation

1:18:59.820 --> 1:19:02.300
 that tells the material scientists

1:19:02.300 --> 1:19:05.500
 or chemists or nuclear physicists,

1:19:05.500 --> 1:19:07.340
 you know, something that is useful to them

1:19:07.340 --> 1:19:08.940
 and that they didn't already know,

1:19:08.940 --> 1:19:11.580
 you know, and you might only need one or two successes

1:19:11.580 --> 1:19:12.940
 in order to change some, you know,

1:19:12.940 --> 1:19:14.620
 billion dollar industries, right?

1:19:14.620 --> 1:19:18.300
 Like, you know, the way that people make fertilizer right now

1:19:18.300 --> 1:19:20.700
 is still based on the Haber Bosch process

1:19:20.700 --> 1:19:22.140
 from a century ago.

1:19:22.140 --> 1:19:25.420
 And it is some many body quantum mechanics problem

1:19:25.420 --> 1:19:27.260
 that no one really understands, right?

1:19:27.260 --> 1:19:30.700
 If you could design a better way to make fertilizer, right?

1:19:30.700 --> 1:19:33.180
 That's, you know, billions of dollars right there.

1:19:33.180 --> 1:19:35.980
 So those are sort of the applications

1:19:35.980 --> 1:19:38.620
 that people are going to be aggressively racing toward

1:19:38.620 --> 1:19:40.060
 over the next decade.

1:19:40.060 --> 1:19:42.460
 Now, I don't know if they're gonna realize it or not,

1:19:42.460 --> 1:19:46.140
 but, you know, they certainly at least have a shot.

1:19:46.140 --> 1:19:48.780
 So it's gonna be a very, very interesting next decade.

1:19:48.780 --> 1:19:50.940
 But just to clarify, what's your intuition?

1:19:51.980 --> 1:19:53.980
 If a breakthrough like that comes with,

1:19:53.980 --> 1:19:56.620
 is it possible for that breakthrough to be on 50

1:19:56.620 --> 1:20:01.020
 to 100 qubits or is scale a fundamental thing

1:20:01.020 --> 1:20:04.220
 like 500, 1000 plus qubits?

1:20:04.220 --> 1:20:08.460
 Yeah, so I can tell you what the current studies are saying.

1:20:09.100 --> 1:20:12.060
 You know, I think probably better to rely on that

1:20:12.060 --> 1:20:13.260
 than on my intuition.

1:20:13.900 --> 1:20:17.500
 But, you know, there was a group at Microsoft

1:20:17.500 --> 1:20:20.780
 had a study a few years ago that said

1:20:20.780 --> 1:20:23.660
 even with only about 100 qubits,

1:20:23.660 --> 1:20:26.060
 you know, you could already learn something new

1:20:26.060 --> 1:20:30.780
 about the chemical reaction that makes fertilizer, for example.

1:20:30.780 --> 1:20:34.460
 The trouble is they're talking about 100 qubits

1:20:34.460 --> 1:20:38.780
 and about a million layers of quantum gates.

1:20:38.780 --> 1:20:40.700
 Okay, so basically they're talking about

1:20:40.700 --> 1:20:42.940
 100 nearly perfect qubits.

1:20:42.940 --> 1:20:44.700
 So the logical qubits, as you mentioned before.

1:20:44.700 --> 1:20:47.500
 Yeah, exactly, 100 logical qubits.

1:20:47.500 --> 1:20:50.700
 And now, you know, the hard part for the next decade

1:20:50.700 --> 1:20:52.220
 is gonna be, well, what can we do

1:20:52.220 --> 1:20:55.020
 with 100 to 200 noisy qubits?

1:20:56.220 --> 1:20:59.020
 Yeah, is there error correction breakthroughs

1:20:59.020 --> 1:21:00.860
 that might come without the need to do

1:21:01.900 --> 1:21:04.940
 thousands or millions of physical qubits?

1:21:04.940 --> 1:21:07.820
 Yeah, so people are gonna be pushing simultaneously

1:21:07.820 --> 1:21:09.820
 on a bunch of different directions.

1:21:09.820 --> 1:21:11.020
 One direction, of course,

1:21:11.020 --> 1:21:13.180
 is just making the qubits better, right?

1:21:14.140 --> 1:21:16.940
 And, you know, there is tremendous progress there.

1:21:16.940 --> 1:21:19.260
 I mean, you know, the fidelity is like

1:21:19.260 --> 1:21:22.540
 the accuracy of the qubits has improved

1:21:22.540 --> 1:21:24.540
 by several orders of magnitude, you know,

1:21:24.540 --> 1:21:28.220
 in the last decade or two.

1:21:28.220 --> 1:21:31.660
 Okay, the second thing is designing better error,

1:21:31.660 --> 1:21:36.060
 you know, let's say lower overhead error correcting codes

1:21:36.060 --> 1:21:40.140
 and even short of doing the full recursive error correction.

1:21:40.140 --> 1:21:43.340
 You know, there are these error mitigation strategies

1:21:43.340 --> 1:21:45.660
 that you can use, you know, that may, you know,

1:21:47.020 --> 1:21:52.300
 allow you to eke out a useful speed up in the near term.

1:21:52.300 --> 1:21:56.140
 And then the third thing is just taking the quantum algorithms

1:21:56.140 --> 1:21:59.900
 for simulating quantum chemistry or materials

1:21:59.900 --> 1:22:01.740
 and making them more efficient.

1:22:01.740 --> 1:22:03.180
 You know, and those algorithms

1:22:03.180 --> 1:22:05.580
 are already dramatically more efficient

1:22:05.580 --> 1:22:07.900
 than they were, let's say, five years ago.

1:22:07.900 --> 1:22:10.460
 And so when, you know, I quoted these estimates

1:22:10.460 --> 1:22:13.260
 like, you know, circuit depth of one million.

1:22:13.260 --> 1:22:16.700
 And so, you know, I hope that because people will care enough

1:22:16.700 --> 1:22:18.140
 that these numbers are gonna come down.

1:22:18.860 --> 1:22:24.380
 So you're one of the world class researchers in this space.

1:22:24.380 --> 1:22:26.060
 There's a few groups like you mentioned,

1:22:26.060 --> 1:22:27.820
 Google and IBM working at this.

1:22:27.820 --> 1:22:32.140
 There's other research labs, but you put also,

1:22:32.140 --> 1:22:35.820
 you have an amazing blog.

1:22:35.820 --> 1:22:39.980
 You just, you put a lot, you paid me to say it.

1:22:41.180 --> 1:22:44.060
 You put a lot of effort sort of to communicating

1:22:44.060 --> 1:22:47.900
 the science of this and communicating,

1:22:47.900 --> 1:22:52.060
 exposing some of the BS and sort of the natural,

1:22:52.060 --> 1:22:56.700
 just like in the AI space, the natural charlatanism,

1:22:56.700 --> 1:23:00.940
 if that's a word in this, in the quantum mechanics in general,

1:23:00.940 --> 1:23:02.860
 but quantum computers and so on.

1:23:02.860 --> 1:23:07.260
 Can you give some notes about people or ideas

1:23:07.900 --> 1:23:10.220
 that people like me or listeners in general

1:23:10.220 --> 1:23:12.540
 from outside the field should be cautious of

1:23:12.540 --> 1:23:15.820
 when they're taking in news headings

1:23:15.820 --> 1:23:18.700
 that Google achieved quantum supremacy?

1:23:19.340 --> 1:23:21.420
 So what should we look out for?

1:23:21.420 --> 1:23:23.020
 Where's the charlatans in the space?

1:23:23.020 --> 1:23:23.980
 Where's the BS?

1:23:23.980 --> 1:23:26.620
 Yeah, so good question.

1:23:26.620 --> 1:23:29.900
 Unfortunately, quantum computing is a little bit like

1:23:29.900 --> 1:23:32.700
 cryptocurrency or deep learning.

1:23:32.700 --> 1:23:34.220
 Like there is a core of something

1:23:34.220 --> 1:23:37.260
 that is genuinely revolutionary and exciting.

1:23:37.260 --> 1:23:40.460
 And because of that core, it attracts this sort of

1:23:40.460 --> 1:23:47.260
 vast penumbra of people making just utterly ridiculous claims.

1:23:47.260 --> 1:23:50.860
 And so with quantum computing, I mean,

1:23:50.860 --> 1:23:54.860
 I would say that the main way that people go astray

1:23:54.860 --> 1:23:59.100
 is by not focusing on sort of the question of,

1:23:59.100 --> 1:24:02.860
 are you getting a speed up over a classical computer or not?

1:24:03.500 --> 1:24:08.860
 And so people have like dismissed quantum supremacy

1:24:08.860 --> 1:24:10.620
 because it's not useful, right?

1:24:10.620 --> 1:24:14.860
 Or it's not itself, let's say, obviously useful for anything.

1:24:14.860 --> 1:24:18.300
 Okay, but ironically, these are some of the same people

1:24:18.300 --> 1:24:21.900
 who will go and say, well, we care about useful applications.

1:24:21.900 --> 1:24:25.020
 We care about solving traffic routing

1:24:25.020 --> 1:24:28.620
 and financial optimization and all these things.

1:24:28.620 --> 1:24:33.500
 And that sounds really good, but their entire spiel

1:24:33.500 --> 1:24:37.260
 is sort of counting on nobody asking the question,

1:24:37.260 --> 1:24:39.900
 yes, but how well could a classical computer

1:24:39.900 --> 1:24:41.740
 do the same thing, right?

1:24:42.700 --> 1:24:47.500
 I really mean the entire thing is they say,

1:24:47.500 --> 1:24:49.180
 well, a quantum computer can do this,

1:24:49.180 --> 1:24:50.700
 a quantum computer can do that.

1:24:50.700 --> 1:24:52.380
 A quantum computer can do that, right?

1:24:52.380 --> 1:24:55.180
 And they just avoid the question,

1:24:55.180 --> 1:24:58.780
 are you getting a speed up over a classical computer or not?

1:24:58.780 --> 1:25:01.340
 And if so, how do you know?

1:25:01.340 --> 1:25:05.420
 Have you really thought carefully about classical algorithms

1:25:05.420 --> 1:25:07.820
 to solve the same problem, right?

1:25:07.820 --> 1:25:10.220
 And a lot of the application areas

1:25:10.220 --> 1:25:15.220
 that the companies and investors are most excited about

1:25:16.700 --> 1:25:19.900
 that the popular press is most excited about

1:25:19.900 --> 1:25:21.740
 where quantum computers have been things

1:25:21.740 --> 1:25:26.740
 like machine learning, AI, optimization, okay?

1:25:27.380 --> 1:25:31.820
 And the problem with that is that since the very beginning,

1:25:31.820 --> 1:25:35.980
 even if you have a perfect fault tolerant,

1:25:35.980 --> 1:25:38.540
 scalable quantum computer,

1:25:40.300 --> 1:25:43.100
 we have known of only modest speed ups

1:25:43.100 --> 1:25:46.420
 that you can get for these problems, okay?

1:25:46.420 --> 1:25:48.780
 So there is a famous quantum algorithm

1:25:48.780 --> 1:25:50.860
 called Grover's algorithm, okay?

1:25:50.860 --> 1:25:52.980
 And what it can do is it can solve many,

1:25:52.980 --> 1:25:56.060
 many of the problems that arise in AI,

1:25:56.060 --> 1:25:58.180
 machine learning, optimization,

1:25:58.180 --> 1:26:00.780
 including NP complete problems, okay?

1:26:00.780 --> 1:26:03.540
 But it can solve them in about the square root

1:26:03.540 --> 1:26:06.700
 of the number of steps that a classical computer would need

1:26:06.700 --> 1:26:08.260
 for the same problems, okay?

1:26:08.260 --> 1:26:12.340
 Now a square root speed up is important, it's impressive.

1:26:12.340 --> 1:26:15.140
 It is not an exponential speed up, okay?

1:26:15.140 --> 1:26:17.780
 So it is not the kind of game changer

1:26:17.780 --> 1:26:20.820
 that let's say Shor's algorithm for factoring is,

1:26:20.820 --> 1:26:23.700
 or for that matter that simulation of quantum mechanics is,

1:26:23.700 --> 1:26:26.260
 okay, it is a more modest speed up.

1:26:26.260 --> 1:26:28.780
 And let's say roughly, in theory,

1:26:28.780 --> 1:26:30.380
 it could roughly double the size

1:26:30.380 --> 1:26:33.380
 of the optimization problems that you could handle, right?

1:26:33.380 --> 1:26:38.380
 And so because people found that I guess too boring

1:26:39.300 --> 1:26:43.980
 or too unimpressive, they've gone on to like invent

1:26:43.980 --> 1:26:46.340
 all of these heuristic algorithms

1:26:46.340 --> 1:26:49.380
 where because no one really understands them,

1:26:49.380 --> 1:26:52.500
 you can just project your hopes onto them, right?

1:26:52.500 --> 1:26:55.780
 That, well, maybe it gets an exponential speed up.

1:26:55.780 --> 1:26:57.740
 You can't prove that it doesn't,

1:26:57.740 --> 1:26:59.300
 and the burden is on you to prove

1:26:59.300 --> 1:27:00.820
 that it doesn't get a speed up, right?

1:27:00.820 --> 1:27:04.860
 And so they've done an immense amount of that kind of thing.

1:27:04.860 --> 1:27:08.020
 And a really worrying amount of the case

1:27:08.020 --> 1:27:10.740
 for building a quantum computer has come to rest

1:27:10.740 --> 1:27:13.620
 on this stuff that those of us in this field

1:27:13.620 --> 1:27:17.620
 know perfectly well is on extremely shaky foundations.

1:27:17.620 --> 1:27:20.620
 So the fundamental question is,

1:27:20.620 --> 1:27:23.500
 show that there's a speed up over the classical.

1:27:23.500 --> 1:27:24.340
 Absolutely.

1:27:24.340 --> 1:27:26.500
 And in this space that you're referring to,

1:27:26.500 --> 1:27:27.660
 which is actually really interesting,

1:27:27.660 --> 1:27:30.100
 it's the area that a lot of people excited about

1:27:30.100 --> 1:27:31.340
 is machine learning.

1:27:31.340 --> 1:27:34.700
 So your sense is, do you think it will,

1:27:34.700 --> 1:27:37.740
 I know that there's a lot of smoke currently,

1:27:37.740 --> 1:27:40.300
 but do you think there actually eventually

1:27:40.300 --> 1:27:45.020
 might be breakthroughs where you do get exponential speed ups

1:27:45.020 --> 1:27:46.580
 in the machine learning space?

1:27:46.580 --> 1:27:48.020
 Absolutely, there might be.

1:27:48.020 --> 1:27:50.700
 I mean, I think we know of modest speed ups

1:27:50.700 --> 1:27:52.700
 that you can get for these problems.

1:27:52.700 --> 1:27:55.540
 I think, you know, whether you can get bigger speed ups

1:27:55.540 --> 1:28:00.380
 is one of the biggest questions for quantum computing theory,

1:28:00.380 --> 1:28:03.620
 you know, for people like me to be thinking about.

1:28:03.620 --> 1:28:06.740
 Now, you know, we had actually recently

1:28:06.740 --> 1:28:11.020
 a really, you know, a super exciting candidate

1:28:11.020 --> 1:28:13.620
 for an exponential quantum speed up

1:28:13.620 --> 1:28:15.220
 for a machine learning problem

1:28:15.220 --> 1:28:16.820
 that people really care about.

1:28:16.820 --> 1:28:19.140
 This is basically the Netflix problem,

1:28:19.140 --> 1:28:22.420
 the problem of recommending products to users

1:28:22.420 --> 1:28:25.580
 given some sparse data about their preferences.

1:28:25.580 --> 1:28:29.540
 Karinidis and Prakash in 2016 had an algorithm

1:28:29.540 --> 1:28:33.700
 for sampling recommendations that was exponentially faster

1:28:33.700 --> 1:28:35.980
 than any known classical algorithm, right?

1:28:35.980 --> 1:28:37.980
 And so, you know, a lot of people were excited.

1:28:37.980 --> 1:28:40.100
 I was excited about it.

1:28:40.100 --> 1:28:44.500
 I had an 18 year old undergrad by the name of Yilin Tang,

1:28:44.500 --> 1:28:47.140
 and she was obviously brilliant.

1:28:47.140 --> 1:28:48.780
 She was looking for a project.

1:28:48.780 --> 1:28:50.340
 I gave her as a project,

1:28:50.340 --> 1:28:52.860
 can you prove that this speed up is real?

1:28:52.860 --> 1:28:55.580
 Can you prove that, you know, any classical algorithm

1:28:55.580 --> 1:28:58.820
 would need to access exponentially more data, right?

1:28:58.820 --> 1:29:01.660
 And, you know, this was a case where if that was true,

1:29:01.660 --> 1:29:04.660
 this was not like a P versus NP type of question, right?

1:29:04.660 --> 1:29:07.060
 This might well have been provable,

1:29:07.060 --> 1:29:09.100
 but she worked on it for a year.

1:29:09.100 --> 1:29:10.540
 She couldn't do it.

1:29:10.540 --> 1:29:13.340
 Eventually she figured out why she couldn't do it.

1:29:13.340 --> 1:29:15.420
 And the reason was that that was false.

1:29:15.420 --> 1:29:18.140
 There is a classical algorithm

1:29:18.140 --> 1:29:20.820
 with a similar performance to the quantum algorithm.

1:29:20.820 --> 1:29:23.860
 So Yilin succeeded in dequantizing

1:29:23.860 --> 1:29:25.300
 that machine learning algorithm.

1:29:25.300 --> 1:29:27.940
 And then in the last couple of years,

1:29:27.940 --> 1:29:30.180
 building on Yilin's breakthrough,

1:29:30.180 --> 1:29:32.980
 a bunch of the other quantum machine learning algorithms

1:29:32.980 --> 1:29:36.180
 that were proposed have now also been dequantized.

1:29:36.180 --> 1:29:37.020
 Yeah.

1:29:37.020 --> 1:29:37.860
 Okay, and so I would say, yeah.

1:29:37.860 --> 1:29:40.100
 That's a kind of important backwards step.

1:29:40.100 --> 1:29:41.260
 Yes.

1:29:41.260 --> 1:29:43.580
 Like a forward step for science,

1:29:43.580 --> 1:29:46.940
 but a step for quantum machine learning

1:29:46.940 --> 1:29:50.780
 that precedes the big next forward step.

1:29:50.780 --> 1:29:51.740
 Right, right, right.

1:29:51.740 --> 1:29:52.580
 If it's possible.

1:29:52.580 --> 1:29:54.300
 Right, now some people will say,

1:29:54.300 --> 1:29:57.020
 well, you know, there's a silver lining in this cloud.

1:29:57.020 --> 1:29:59.260
 They say, well, thinking about quantum computing

1:29:59.260 --> 1:30:01.020
 has led to the discovery

1:30:01.020 --> 1:30:03.860
 of potentially useful new classical algorithms.

1:30:03.860 --> 1:30:04.700
 That's true.

1:30:04.700 --> 1:30:07.460
 And so, you know, so you get these spinoff applications,

1:30:07.460 --> 1:30:09.300
 but if you want a quantum speed up,

1:30:09.300 --> 1:30:11.860
 you really have to think carefully about that.

1:30:11.860 --> 1:30:15.220
 You know, Yilin's work was a perfect illustration of why.

1:30:15.220 --> 1:30:18.820
 Right, and I think that, you know, the challenge,

1:30:18.820 --> 1:30:22.340
 you know, the field is now open, right?

1:30:22.340 --> 1:30:23.820
 Find a better example,

1:30:23.820 --> 1:30:26.580
 find, you know, where quantum computers

1:30:26.580 --> 1:30:29.420
 are going to deliver big gains for machine learning.

1:30:29.420 --> 1:30:31.820
 You know, I am, you know,

1:30:31.820 --> 1:30:33.740
 not only do I ardently support,

1:30:33.740 --> 1:30:35.980
 you know, people thinking about that,

1:30:35.980 --> 1:30:37.660
 I'm trying to think about it myself

1:30:37.660 --> 1:30:41.420
 and have my students and postdocs think about it,

1:30:41.420 --> 1:30:42.980
 but we should not pretend

1:30:42.980 --> 1:30:45.420
 that those speed ups are already established.

1:30:45.420 --> 1:30:49.300
 And the problem comes when so many of the companies

1:30:49.300 --> 1:30:52.380
 and, you know, and journalists in this space

1:30:52.380 --> 1:30:53.540
 are pretending that.

1:30:54.700 --> 1:30:57.740
 Like all good things, like life itself,

1:30:57.740 --> 1:31:00.540
 this conversation must soon come to an end.

1:31:00.540 --> 1:31:04.620
 Let me ask the most absurdly philosophical last question.

1:31:04.620 --> 1:31:07.500
 What is the meaning of life?

1:31:07.500 --> 1:31:11.540
 What gives your life fulfillment, purpose,

1:31:11.540 --> 1:31:15.500
 happiness, and yeah, meaning?

1:31:15.500 --> 1:31:18.860
 I would say, you know, number one,

1:31:18.860 --> 1:31:22.420
 trying to discover new things about the world

1:31:22.420 --> 1:31:25.380
 and share them and, you know, communicate

1:31:25.380 --> 1:31:29.380
 and learn what other people have discovered.

1:31:29.380 --> 1:31:33.540
 You know, number two, you know, my friends,

1:31:33.540 --> 1:31:38.540
 my family, my kids, my students,

1:31:40.620 --> 1:31:42.820
 you know, just the people around me.

1:31:43.780 --> 1:31:46.780
 Number three, you know, trying, you know,

1:31:46.780 --> 1:31:50.740
 when I can to, you know, make the world better

1:31:50.740 --> 1:31:52.100
 in some small ways.

1:31:52.100 --> 1:31:54.500
 And, you know, it's depressing that I can't do more

1:31:54.500 --> 1:31:58.660
 and that, you know, the world is, you know,

1:31:58.660 --> 1:32:01.100
 facing crises over, you know, the climate

1:32:01.100 --> 1:32:04.460
 and over, you know, sort of resurgent authoritarianism

1:32:04.460 --> 1:32:06.740
 and all these other things, but, you know,

1:32:06.740 --> 1:32:10.580
 trying to stand against the things

1:32:10.580 --> 1:32:13.180
 that I find horrible when I can.

1:32:13.180 --> 1:32:16.060
 Let me ask you one more absurd question.

1:32:16.060 --> 1:32:17.340
 What makes you smile?

1:32:18.740 --> 1:32:20.660
 Well, yeah, I guess your question just did.

1:32:20.660 --> 1:32:21.500
 I don't know.

1:32:21.500 --> 1:32:25.740
 I thought I tried that absurd one on you.

1:32:25.740 --> 1:32:28.580
 Well, it was a huge honor to talk to you.

1:32:28.580 --> 1:32:30.740
 We'll probably talk to you for many more hours, Scott.

1:32:30.740 --> 1:32:31.660
 Thank you so much.

1:32:31.660 --> 1:32:32.500
 Well, thank you.

1:32:32.500 --> 1:32:33.340
 Thank you.

1:32:33.340 --> 1:32:34.500

 Now, let me leave you with some words

1:33:03.860 --> 1:33:06.220
 from a funny and insightful blog post

1:33:06.220 --> 1:33:08.500
 Scott wrote over 10 years ago

1:33:08.500 --> 1:33:12.940
 on the ever present Malthusianisms in our daily lives.

1:33:12.940 --> 1:33:14.860
 Quote, again and again,

1:33:14.860 --> 1:33:17.060
 I've undergone the humbling experience

1:33:17.060 --> 1:33:19.780
 of first lamenting how badly something sucks,

1:33:19.780 --> 1:33:23.500
 then only much later having the crucial insight

1:33:23.500 --> 1:33:25.180
 that it's not sucking

1:33:25.180 --> 1:33:28.100
 wouldn't have been a Nash equilibrium.

1:33:29.260 --> 1:33:30.580
 Thank you for listening.

1:33:30.580 --> 1:33:50.580
 I hope to see you next time.
