WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
 The following is a conversation with Michael Kearns.

00:03.120 --> 00:06.240
 He's a professor at the University of Pennsylvania

00:06.240 --> 00:09.520
 and a coauthor of the new book, Ethical Algorithm,

00:09.520 --> 00:11.840
 that is the focus of much of this conversation.

00:12.640 --> 00:16.640
 It includes algorithmic fairness, bias, privacy,

00:16.640 --> 00:18.080
 and ethics in general.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.000
 But that is just one of many fields

00:20.000 --> 00:22.480
 that Michael is a world class researcher in,

00:22.480 --> 00:24.880
 some of which we touch on quickly,

00:24.880 --> 00:26.240
 including learning theory

00:26.240 --> 00:29.120
 or the theoretical foundation of machine learning,

00:29.120 --> 00:31.280
 game theory, quantitative finance,

00:31.280 --> 00:33.440
 computational social science, and much more.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.600
 But on a personal note,

00:35.600 --> 00:38.320
 when I was an undergrad, early on,

00:38.320 --> 00:39.520
 I worked with Michael

00:39.520 --> 00:41.280
 on an algorithmic trading project

00:41.280 --> 00:42.560
 and competition that he led.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.720
 That's when I first fell in love

00:44.720 --> 00:46.160
 with algorithmic game theory.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.400
 While most of my research life

00:48.400 --> 00:49.520
 has been in machine learning

00:49.520 --> 00:50.880
 and human robot interaction,

00:51.440 --> 00:53.600
 the systematic way that game theory

00:53.600 --> 00:55.120
 reveals the beautiful structure

00:55.120 --> 00:58.480
 in our competitive and cooperating world of humans

00:58.480 --> 01:00.480
 has been a continued inspiration to me.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.520
 So for that and other things,

01:03.520 --> 01:05.600
 I'm deeply thankful to Michael

01:05.600 --> 01:07.920
 and really enjoyed having this conversation

01:07.920 --> 01:10.160
 again in person after so many years.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.760
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:13.760 --> 01:16.080
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

01:16.080 --> 01:18.320
 give it five stars on Apple Podcast,

01:18.320 --> 01:19.760
 support on Patreon,

01:19.760 --> 01:21.680
 or simply connect with me on Twitter

01:21.680 --> 01:24.800
 at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

01:25.760 --> 01:27.280
 This episode is supported

01:27.280 --> 01:30.320
 by an amazing podcast called Pessimists Archive.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.720
 Jason, the host of the show,

01:32.720 --> 01:35.360
 reached out to me looking to support this podcast,

01:35.360 --> 01:37.600
 and so I listened to it, to check it out.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.720
 And by listened, I mean I went through it,

01:40.720 --> 01:43.680
 Netflix binge style, at least five episodes in a row.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.480
 It's not one of my favorite podcasts,

01:46.480 --> 01:48.720
 and I think it should be one of the top podcasts

01:48.720 --> 01:49.680
 in the world, frankly.

01:50.480 --> 01:51.760
 It's a history show

01:51.760 --> 01:54.080
 about why people resist new things.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.400
 Each episode looks at a moment in history

01:56.400 --> 01:59.040
 when something new was introduced,

01:59.040 --> 02:01.680
 something that today we think of as commonplace,

02:01.680 --> 02:04.560
 like recorded music, umbrellas, bicycles, cars,

02:04.560 --> 02:06.400
 chess, coffee, the elevator,

02:06.960 --> 02:09.600
 and the show explores why it freaked everyone out.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.800
 The latest episode on mirrors and vanity

02:12.800 --> 02:15.360
 still stays with me as I think about vanity

02:15.360 --> 02:17.680
 in the modern day of the Twitter world.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.880
 That's the fascinating thing about the show,

02:20.880 --> 02:22.640
 is that stuff that happened long ago,

02:22.640 --> 02:25.040
 especially in terms of our fear of new things,

02:25.040 --> 02:26.880
 repeats itself in the modern day,

02:26.880 --> 02:29.280
 and so has many lessons for us to think about

02:29.280 --> 02:31.040
 in terms of human psychology

02:31.040 --> 02:33.120
 and the role of technology in our society.

02:34.160 --> 02:35.600
 Anyway, you should subscribe

02:35.600 --> 02:37.200
 and listen to Pessimist Archive.

02:37.760 --> 02:39.200
 I highly recommend it.

02:39.840 --> 02:43.680
 And now, here's my conversation with Michael Kearns.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.840
 You mentioned reading Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

02:47.840 --> 02:49.840
 in high school, and having a more,

02:50.800 --> 02:52.560
 or a bit more of a literary mind.

02:52.560 --> 02:56.160
 So, what books, non technical, non computer science,

02:56.880 --> 02:59.360
 would you say had the biggest impact on your life,

02:59.360 --> 03:02.400
 either intellectually or emotionally?

03:02.400 --> 03:04.640
 You've dug deep into my history, I see.

03:04.640 --> 03:05.680
 Went deep.

03:05.680 --> 03:08.240
 Yeah, I think, well, my favorite novel is

03:08.240 --> 03:10.960
 Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace,

03:10.960 --> 03:13.360
 which actually, coincidentally,

03:13.360 --> 03:15.840
 much of it takes place in the halls of buildings

03:15.840 --> 03:17.200
 right around us here at MIT.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
 So that certainly had a big influence on me.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.320
 And as you noticed, like, when I was in high school,

03:22.320 --> 03:25.440
 I actually even started college as an English major.

03:25.440 --> 03:29.120
 So, I was very influenced by sort of that genre of journalism

03:29.120 --> 03:30.880
 at the time, and thought I wanted to be a writer,

03:30.880 --> 03:33.840
 and then realized that an English major teaches you to read,

03:33.840 --> 03:35.360
 but it doesn't teach you how to write,

03:35.360 --> 03:36.960
 and then I became interested in math

03:36.960 --> 03:38.560
 and computer science instead.

03:38.560 --> 03:41.040
 Well, in your new book, Ethical Algorithm,

03:41.600 --> 03:45.920
 you kind of sneak up from an algorithmic perspective

03:45.920 --> 03:48.400
 on these deep, profound philosophical questions

03:48.400 --> 03:53.520
 of fairness, of privacy.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.400
 In thinking about these topics,

03:56.400 --> 04:01.440
 how often do you return to that literary mind that you had?

04:01.440 --> 04:04.320
 Yeah, I'd like to claim there was a deeper connection,

04:05.200 --> 04:07.920
 but, you know, I think both Aaron and I

04:07.920 --> 04:10.320
 kind of came at these topics first and foremost

04:10.320 --> 04:11.280
 from a technical angle.

04:11.280 --> 04:14.720
 I mean, you know, I kind of consider myself primarily

04:14.720 --> 04:17.600
 and originally a machine learning researcher,

04:17.600 --> 04:20.400
 and I think as we just watched, like the rest of the society,

04:20.400 --> 04:23.440
 the field technically advance, and then quickly on the heels

04:23.440 --> 04:27.120
 of that kind of the buzzkill of all of the antisocial behavior

04:27.120 --> 04:29.360
 by algorithms, just kind of realized

04:29.360 --> 04:31.840
 there was an opportunity for us to do something about it

04:31.840 --> 04:33.360
 from a research perspective.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.320
 You know, more to the point in your question,

04:36.320 --> 04:41.600
 I mean, I do have an uncle who is literally a moral philosopher,

04:41.600 --> 04:43.280
 and so in the early days of my life,

04:43.280 --> 04:46.000
 he was a philosopher, and so in the early days

04:46.000 --> 04:48.800
 of our technical work on fairness topics,

04:48.800 --> 04:51.280
 I would occasionally, you know, run ideas behind him.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.440
 So, I mean, I remember an early email I sent to him

04:53.440 --> 04:55.040
 in which I said, like, oh, you know,

04:55.040 --> 04:57.840
 here's a specific definition of algorithmic fairness

04:57.840 --> 05:01.600
 that we think is some sort of variant of Rawlsian fairness.

05:02.320 --> 05:03.120
 What do you think?

05:03.920 --> 05:06.880
 And I thought I was asking a yes or no question,

05:06.880 --> 05:09.120
 and I got back your kind of classical philosopher's

05:09.120 --> 05:10.800
 response saying, well, it depends.

05:10.800 --> 05:14.400
 Hey, then you might conclude this, and that's when I realized

05:14.400 --> 05:19.680
 that there was a real kind of rift between the ways

05:19.680 --> 05:21.840
 philosophers and others had thought about things

05:21.840 --> 05:25.680
 like fairness, you know, from sort of a humanitarian perspective

05:25.680 --> 05:27.840
 and the way that you needed to think about it

05:27.840 --> 05:30.720
 as a computer scientist if you were going to kind of

05:30.720 --> 05:32.960
 implement actual algorithmic solutions.

05:34.080 --> 05:39.200
 But I would say the algorithmic solutions take care

05:39.200 --> 05:41.360
 of some of the low hanging fruit.

05:41.360 --> 05:44.560
 Sort of the problem is a lot of algorithms,

05:44.560 --> 05:46.160
 when they don't consider fairness,

05:47.280 --> 05:50.240
 they are just terribly unfair.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.680
 And when they don't consider privacy,

05:51.680 --> 05:55.200
 they're terribly, they violate privacy.

05:55.200 --> 05:59.680
 Sort of the algorithmic approach fixes big problems.

05:59.680 --> 06:04.000
 But there's still, when you start pushing into the gray area,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.240
 that's when you start getting into this philosophy

06:06.240 --> 06:09.680
 of what it means to be fair, starting from Plato,

06:09.680 --> 06:11.760
 what is justice kind of questions?

06:12.400 --> 06:13.280
 Yeah, I think that's right.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.960
 And I mean, I would even not go as far as you want to say

06:16.960 --> 06:19.520
 that sort of the algorithmic work in these areas

06:19.520 --> 06:21.520
 is solving like the biggest problems.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.320
 And, you know, we discuss in the book,

06:24.320 --> 06:27.520
 the fact that really we are, there's a sense in which

06:27.520 --> 06:29.760
 we're kind of looking where the light is in that,

06:30.640 --> 06:34.880
 you know, for example, if police are racist

06:34.880 --> 06:36.960
 in who they decide to stop and frisk,

06:37.760 --> 06:39.120
 and that goes into the data,

06:39.120 --> 06:41.520
 there's sort of no undoing that downstream

06:41.520 --> 06:44.560
 by kind of clever algorithmic methods.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.520
 And I think, especially in fairness,

06:47.520 --> 06:49.840
 I mean, I think less so in privacy,

06:49.840 --> 06:52.880
 where we feel like the community kind of really has settled

06:52.880 --> 06:56.320
 on the right definition, which is differential privacy.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.960
 If you just look at the algorithmic fairness literature

06:58.960 --> 07:01.600
 already, you can see it's going to be much more of a mess.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.360
 And, you know, you've got these theorems saying,

07:03.360 --> 07:06.640
 here are three entirely reasonable,

07:06.640 --> 07:09.760
 desirable notions of fairness.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.720
 And, you know, here's a proof that you cannot simultaneously

07:12.720 --> 07:13.840
 have all three of them.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.680
 So I think we know that algorithmic fairness

07:17.680 --> 07:19.280
 compared to algorithmic privacy

07:19.280 --> 07:21.600
 is going to be kind of a harder problem.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.440
 And it will have to revisit, I think,

07:23.440 --> 07:26.080
 things that have been thought about by,

07:26.080 --> 07:28.560
 you know, many generations of scholars before us.

07:29.520 --> 07:32.240
 So it's very early days for fairness, I think.

07:32.240 --> 07:34.560
 TK So before we get into the details

07:34.560 --> 07:37.280
 of differential privacy, and on the fairness side,

07:37.280 --> 07:39.520
 let me linger on the philosophy a bit.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.640
 Do you think most people are fundamentally good?

07:43.600 --> 07:46.640
 Or do most of us have both the capacity

07:46.640 --> 07:48.320
 for good and evil within us?

07:48.320 --> 07:50.240
 SB I mean, I'm an optimist.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.480
 I tend to think that most people are good

07:52.480 --> 07:54.960
 and want to do right.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.480
 And that deviations from that are, you know,

07:58.480 --> 08:00.240
 kind of usually due to circumstance,

08:00.240 --> 08:02.960
 not due to people being bad at heart.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.720
 TK With people with power,

08:05.520 --> 08:08.160
 are people at the heads of governments,

08:08.160 --> 08:09.680
 people at the heads of companies,

08:10.320 --> 08:13.920
 people at the heads of, maybe, so financial power markets,

08:15.040 --> 08:19.040
 do you think the distribution there is also,

08:19.040 --> 08:21.040
 most people are good and have good intent?

08:21.040 --> 08:22.800
 SB Yeah, I do.

08:22.800 --> 08:26.560
 I mean, my statement wasn't qualified to people

08:26.560 --> 08:28.560
 not in positions of power.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.640
 I mean, I think what happens in a lot of the, you know,

08:30.640 --> 08:34.080
 the cliche about absolute power corrupts absolutely.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.880
 I mean, you know, I think even short of that,

08:37.680 --> 08:39.840
 you know, having spent a lot of time on Wall Street,

08:40.720 --> 08:44.160
 and also in arenas very, very different from Wall Street,

08:44.160 --> 08:46.960
 like academia, you know, one of the things

08:47.920 --> 08:50.960
 I think I've benefited from by moving between

08:50.960 --> 08:53.760
 two very different worlds is you become aware

08:53.760 --> 08:57.120
 that, you know, these worlds kind of develop

08:57.120 --> 08:59.040
 their own social norms, and they develop

08:59.040 --> 09:02.080
 their own rationales for, you know,

09:02.080 --> 09:03.920
 behavior, for instance, that might look

09:03.920 --> 09:05.280
 unusual to outsiders.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.120
 But when you're in that world,

09:07.120 --> 09:08.640
 it doesn't feel unusual at all.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.680
 And I think this is true of a lot of,

09:11.680 --> 09:13.760
 you know, professional cultures, for instance.

09:15.440 --> 09:18.480
 And, you know, so then your maybe slippery slope

09:18.480 --> 09:19.600
 is too strong of a word.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.040
 But, you know, you're in some world

09:21.040 --> 09:23.200
 where you're mainly around other people

09:23.200 --> 09:25.520
 with the same kind of viewpoints and training

09:25.520 --> 09:27.360
 and worldview as you.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.640
 And I think that's more of a source of,

09:30.640 --> 09:33.280
 of, you know, kind of abuses of power

09:34.560 --> 09:36.720
 than sort of, you know, there being good people

09:36.720 --> 09:40.640
 and evil people, and that somehow the evil people

09:40.640 --> 09:43.040
 are the ones that somehow rise to power.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.160
 Oh, that's really interesting.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.880
 So it's the, within the social norms

09:46.880 --> 09:49.760
 constructed by that particular group of people,

09:50.400 --> 09:51.920
 you're all trying to do good.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.640
 But because as a group, you might be,

09:54.640 --> 09:56.080
 you might drift into something

09:56.080 --> 09:57.600
 that for the broader population,

09:58.160 --> 10:00.480
 it does not align with the values of society.

10:00.480 --> 10:01.680
 That kind of, that's the word.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.520
 Yeah, I mean, or not that you drift,

10:03.520 --> 10:07.440
 but even the things that don't make sense

10:07.440 --> 10:10.080
 to the outside world don't seem unusual to you.

10:11.280 --> 10:13.360
 So it's not sort of like a good or a bad thing,

10:13.360 --> 10:14.800
 but, you know, like, so for instance,

10:14.800 --> 10:18.160
 you know, on, in the world of finance, right?

10:18.160 --> 10:21.280
 There's a lot of complicated types of activity

10:21.280 --> 10:22.960
 that if you are not immersed in that world,

10:22.960 --> 10:25.760
 you cannot see why the purpose of that,

10:25.760 --> 10:27.440
 you know, that activity exists at all.

10:27.440 --> 10:30.640
 It just seems like, you know, completely useless

10:30.640 --> 10:33.440
 and people just like, you know, pushing money around.

10:33.440 --> 10:34.800
 And when you're in that world, right,

10:34.800 --> 10:36.640
 you're, and you learn more,

10:36.640 --> 10:39.600
 your view does become more nuanced, right?

10:39.600 --> 10:41.680
 You realize, okay, there is actually a function

10:41.680 --> 10:43.120
 to this activity.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.640
 And in some cases, you would conclude that actually,

10:46.640 --> 10:50.240
 if magically we could eradicate this activity tomorrow,

10:50.240 --> 10:52.720
 it would come back because it actually is like

10:52.720 --> 10:54.400
 serving some useful purpose.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.880
 It's just a useful purpose that's very difficult

10:56.880 --> 10:58.560
 for outsiders to see.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.720
 And so I think, you know, lots of professional work

11:02.720 --> 11:05.280
 environments or cultures, as I might put it,

11:06.320 --> 11:08.800
 kind of have these social norms that, you know,

11:08.800 --> 11:10.160
 don't make sense to the outside world.

11:10.160 --> 11:11.280
 Academia is the same, right?

11:11.280 --> 11:13.600
 I mean, lots of people look at academia and say,

11:13.600 --> 11:15.920
 you know, what the hell are all of you people doing?

11:16.480 --> 11:18.960
 Why are you paid so much in some cases

11:18.960 --> 11:21.840
 at taxpayer expenses to do, you know,

11:21.840 --> 11:24.400
 to publish papers that nobody reads?

11:24.400 --> 11:25.920
 You know, but when you're in that world,

11:25.920 --> 11:27.680
 you come to see the value for it.

11:27.680 --> 11:30.240
 And, but even though you might not be able to explain it

11:30.240 --> 11:31.840
 to, you know, the person in the street.

11:33.040 --> 11:33.360
 Right.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.000
 And in the case of the financial sector,

11:36.000 --> 11:39.200
 tools like credit might not make sense to people.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.600
 Like, it's a good example of something that does seem

11:41.600 --> 11:45.120
 to pop up and be useful or just the power of markets

11:45.120 --> 11:47.120
 and just in general capitalism.

11:47.120 --> 11:47.360
 Yeah.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.360
 In finance, I think the primary example

11:49.360 --> 11:51.040
 I would give is leverage, right?

11:51.040 --> 11:56.320
 So being allowed to borrow, to sort of use ten times

11:56.320 --> 11:58.480
 as much money as you've actually borrowed, right?

11:58.480 --> 12:00.720
 So that's an example of something that before I had

12:00.720 --> 12:02.320
 any experience in financial markets,

12:02.320 --> 12:03.440
 I might have looked at and said,

12:03.440 --> 12:05.280
 well, what is the purpose of that?

12:05.280 --> 12:08.400
 That just seems very dangerous and it is dangerous

12:08.400 --> 12:10.480
 and it has proven dangerous.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.280
 But, you know, if the fact of the matter is that,

12:13.280 --> 12:15.920
 you know, sort of on some particular time scale,

12:16.560 --> 12:19.680
 you are holding positions that are,

12:19.680 --> 12:23.040
 you know, very unlikely to, you know,

12:23.040 --> 12:26.800
 lose, you know, your value at risk or variance

12:26.800 --> 12:30.320
 is like one or five percent, then it kind of makes sense

12:30.320 --> 12:32.160
 that you would be allowed to use a little bit more

12:32.160 --> 12:35.120
 than you have because you have, you know,

12:35.120 --> 12:37.760
 some confidence that you're not going to lose

12:37.760 --> 12:38.880
 it all in a single day.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.600
 Now, of course, when that happens,

12:42.960 --> 12:45.920
 we've seen what happens, you know, not too long ago.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.800
 But, you know, but the idea that it serves

12:48.800 --> 12:52.800
 no useful economic purpose under any circumstances

12:52.800 --> 12:54.800
 is definitely not true.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.680
 We'll return to the other side of the coast,

12:57.680 --> 13:02.560
 Silicon Valley, and the problems there as we talk about privacy,

13:02.560 --> 13:03.760
 as we talk about fairness.

13:05.360 --> 13:09.360
 At the high level, and I'll ask some sort of basic questions

13:09.360 --> 13:12.560
 with the hope to get at the fundamental nature of reality.

13:12.560 --> 13:18.160
 But from a very high level, what is an ethical algorithm?

13:18.160 --> 13:20.960
 So I can say that an algorithm has a running time

13:20.960 --> 13:23.680
 of using big O notation n log n.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.760
 I can say that a machine learning algorithm

13:27.760 --> 13:31.440
 classified cat versus dog with 97 percent accuracy.

13:31.440 --> 13:35.040
 Do you think there will one day be a way to measure

13:36.320 --> 13:39.920
 sort of in the same compelling way as the big O notation

13:39.920 --> 13:44.000
 of this algorithm is 97 percent ethical?

13:44.000 --> 13:48.800
 First of all, let me riff for a second on your specific n log n example.

13:48.800 --> 13:51.920
 So because early in the book when we're just kind of trying to describe

13:51.920 --> 13:54.640
 algorithms period, we say like, okay, you know,

13:54.640 --> 13:58.560
 what's an example of an algorithm or an algorithmic problem?

13:58.560 --> 14:00.160
 First of all, like it's sorting, right?

14:00.160 --> 14:02.240
 You have a bunch of index cards with numbers on them

14:02.240 --> 14:03.760
 and you want to sort them.

14:03.760 --> 14:07.360
 And we describe, you know, an algorithm that sweeps all the way through,

14:07.360 --> 14:09.680
 finds the smallest number, puts it at the front,

14:09.680 --> 14:12.640
 then sweeps through again, finds the second smallest number.

14:12.640 --> 14:14.800
 So we make the point that this is an algorithm

14:14.800 --> 14:17.760
 and it's also a bad algorithm in the sense that, you know,

14:17.760 --> 14:20.640
 it's quadratic rather than n log n,

14:20.640 --> 14:23.200
 which we know is kind of optimal for sorting.

14:23.920 --> 14:26.080
 And we make the point that sort of like, you know,

14:26.080 --> 14:30.880
 so even within the confines of a very precisely specified problem,

14:31.680 --> 14:35.200
 there, you know, there might be many, many different algorithms

14:35.200 --> 14:37.520
 for the same problem with different properties.

14:37.520 --> 14:40.400
 Like some might be faster in terms of running time,

14:40.400 --> 14:43.520
 some might use less memory, some might have, you know,

14:43.520 --> 14:45.440
 better distributed implementations.

14:46.240 --> 14:50.560
 And so the point is that already we're used to, you know,

14:50.560 --> 14:53.520
 in computer science thinking about trade offs

14:53.520 --> 14:56.800
 between different types of quantities and resources

14:56.800 --> 14:59.920
 and there being, you know, better and worse algorithms.

15:00.960 --> 15:08.480
 And our book is about that part of algorithmic ethics

15:08.480 --> 15:13.520
 that we know how to kind of put on that same kind of quantitative footing right now.

15:13.520 --> 15:17.440
 So, you know, just to say something that our book is not about,

15:17.440 --> 15:22.400
 our book is not about kind of broad, fuzzy notions of fairness.

15:22.400 --> 15:25.120
 It's about very specific notions of fairness.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.200
 There's more than one of them.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.880
 There are tensions between them, right?

15:30.880 --> 15:35.680
 But if you pick one of them, you can do something akin to saying

15:35.680 --> 15:38.480
 that this algorithm is 97% ethical.

15:39.200 --> 15:44.080
 You can say, for instance, the, you know, for this lending model,

15:44.080 --> 15:51.040
 the false rejection rate on black people and white people is within 3%, right?

15:51.040 --> 15:57.040
 So we might call that a 97% ethical algorithm and a 100% ethical algorithm

15:57.040 --> 15:59.200
 would mean that that difference is 0%.

15:59.920 --> 16:04.640
 In that case, fairness is specified when two groups, however,

16:04.640 --> 16:06.000
 they're defined are given to you.

16:06.720 --> 16:07.280
 That's right.

16:07.280 --> 16:11.280
 So the, and then you can sort of mathematically start describing the algorithm.

16:11.760 --> 16:18.880
 But nevertheless, the part where the two groups are given to you,

16:20.080 --> 16:24.480
 I mean, unlike running time, you know, we don't in computer science

16:24.480 --> 16:29.200
 talk about how fast an algorithm feels like when it runs.

16:29.200 --> 16:29.760
 True.

16:29.760 --> 16:33.040
 We measure it and ethical starts getting into feelings.

16:33.040 --> 16:38.160
 So, for example, an algorithm runs, you know, if it runs in the background,

16:38.160 --> 16:40.480
 it doesn't disturb the performance of my system.

16:40.480 --> 16:41.600
 It'll feel nice.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.560
 I'll be okay with it.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.280
 But if it overloads the system, it'll feel unpleasant.

16:45.280 --> 16:50.320
 So in that same way, ethics, there's a feeling of how socially acceptable it is.

16:50.320 --> 16:55.200
 How does it represent the moral standards of our society today?

16:55.200 --> 16:59.040
 So in that sense, and sorry to linger on that first of high,

16:59.040 --> 17:00.640
 low philosophical questions.

17:00.640 --> 17:05.120
 Do you have a sense we'll be able to measure how ethical an algorithm is?

17:05.920 --> 17:09.680
 First of all, I didn't, certainly didn't mean to give the impression that you can kind of

17:09.680 --> 17:16.320
 measure, you know, memory speed trade offs, you know, and that there's a complete mapping from

17:16.320 --> 17:22.240
 that onto kind of fairness, for instance, or ethics and accuracy, for example.

17:22.880 --> 17:28.960
 In the type of fairness definitions that are largely the objects of study today and starting

17:28.960 --> 17:35.360
 to be deployed, you as the user of the definitions, you need to make some hard decisions before you

17:35.360 --> 17:39.200
 even get to the point of designing fair algorithms.

17:40.240 --> 17:45.840
 One of them, for instance, is deciding who it is that you're worried about protecting,

17:45.840 --> 17:50.560
 who you're worried about being harmed by, for instance, some notion of discrimination or

17:50.560 --> 17:51.200
 unfairness.

17:52.160 --> 17:55.520
 And then you need to also decide what constitutes harm.

17:55.520 --> 18:02.320
 So, for instance, in a lending application, maybe you decide that, you know, falsely rejecting

18:02.320 --> 18:08.960
 a creditworthy individual, you know, sort of a false negative, is the real harm and that false

18:08.960 --> 18:14.560
 positives, i.e. people that are not creditworthy or are not gonna repay your loan, that get a loan,

18:14.560 --> 18:16.320
 you might think of them as lucky.

18:17.120 --> 18:22.720
 And so that's not a harm, although it's not clear that if you don't have the means to repay a loan,

18:22.720 --> 18:26.320
 that being given a loan is not also a harm.

18:26.880 --> 18:33.600
 So, you know, the literature is sort of so far quite limited in that you sort of need to say,

18:33.600 --> 18:36.960
 who do you want to protect and what would constitute harm to that group?

18:37.920 --> 18:42.080
 And when you ask questions like, will algorithms feel ethical?

18:42.080 --> 18:47.440
 One way in which they won't, under the definitions that I'm describing, is if, you know, if you are

18:47.440 --> 18:54.320
 an individual who is falsely denied a loan, incorrectly denied a loan, all of these definitions

18:54.320 --> 19:00.240
 basically say like, well, you know, your compensation is the knowledge that we are also

19:00.240 --> 19:05.120
 falsely denying loans to other people, you know, in other groups at the same rate that we're doing

19:05.120 --> 19:05.680
 it to you.

19:05.680 --> 19:12.800
 And, you know, and so there is actually this interesting even technical tension in the field

19:12.800 --> 19:18.400
 right now between these sort of group notions of fairness and notions of fairness that might

19:18.400 --> 19:22.160
 actually feel like real fairness to individuals, right?

19:22.160 --> 19:27.360
 They might really feel like their particular interests are being protected or thought about

19:27.360 --> 19:32.800
 by the algorithm rather than just, you know, the groups that they happen to be members of.

19:33.360 --> 19:37.920
 Is there parallels to the big O notation of worst case analysis?

19:37.920 --> 19:45.760
 So, is it important to looking at the worst violation of fairness for an individual?

19:45.760 --> 19:48.080
 Is it important to minimize that one individual?

19:48.080 --> 19:52.320
 So like worst case analysis, is that something you think about or?

19:52.320 --> 19:56.960
 I mean, I think we're not even at the point where we can sensibly think about that.

19:56.960 --> 20:03.280
 So first of all, you know, we're talking here both about fairness applied at the group level,

20:03.280 --> 20:08.000
 which is a relatively weak thing, but it's better than nothing.

20:08.000 --> 20:14.960
 And also the more ambitious thing of trying to give some individual promises, but even

20:14.960 --> 20:18.640
 that doesn't incorporate, I think something that you're hinting at here is what I might

20:18.640 --> 20:20.720
 call subjective fairness, right?

20:20.720 --> 20:25.200
 So a lot of the definitions, I mean, all of the definitions in the algorithmic fairness

20:25.200 --> 20:28.400
 literature are what I would kind of call received wisdom definitions.

20:28.400 --> 20:33.440
 It's sort of, you know, somebody like me sits around and things like, okay, you know, I

20:33.440 --> 20:37.840
 think here's a technical definition of fairness that I think people should want or that they

20:37.840 --> 20:41.840
 should, you know, think of as some notion of fairness, maybe not the only one, maybe

20:41.840 --> 20:44.320
 not the best one, maybe not the last one.

20:44.320 --> 20:52.480
 But we really actually don't know from a subjective standpoint, like what people really

20:52.480 --> 20:53.360
 think is fair.

20:53.360 --> 21:01.120
 You know, we just started doing a little bit of work in our group at actually doing kind

21:01.120 --> 21:09.120
 of human subject experiments in which we, you know, ask people about, you know, we ask

21:09.120 --> 21:15.120
 them questions about fairness, we survey them, we, you know, we show them pairs of individuals

21:15.120 --> 21:20.320
 in, let's say, a criminal recidivism prediction setting, and we ask them, do you think these

21:20.320 --> 21:24.320
 two individuals should be treated the same as a matter of fairness?

21:24.320 --> 21:31.760
 And to my knowledge, there's not a large literature in which ordinary people are asked

21:31.760 --> 21:37.040
 about, you know, they have sort of notions of their subjective fairness elicited from

21:37.040 --> 21:37.540
 them.

21:38.160 --> 21:43.840
 It's mainly, you know, kind of scholars who think about fairness kind of making up their

21:43.840 --> 21:44.400
 own definitions.

21:44.400 --> 21:50.320
 And I think this needs to change actually for many social norms, not just for fairness,

21:50.320 --> 21:50.560
 right?

21:50.560 --> 21:56.560
 So there's a lot of discussion these days in the AI community about interpretable AI

21:56.560 --> 21:57.920
 or understandable AI.

21:58.560 --> 22:04.880
 And as far as I can tell, everybody agrees that deep learning or at least the outputs

22:04.880 --> 22:11.840
 of deep learning are not very understandable, and people might agree that sparse linear

22:11.840 --> 22:15.520
 models with integer coefficients are more understandable.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.440
 But nobody's really asked people.

22:17.440 --> 22:21.280
 You know, there's very little literature on, you know, sort of showing people models

22:21.280 --> 22:24.080
 and asking them, do they understand what the model is doing?

22:25.280 --> 22:32.560
 And I think that in all these topics, as these fields mature, we need to start doing more

22:32.560 --> 22:33.520
 behavioral work.

22:34.400 --> 22:38.160
 Yeah, which is one of my deep passions is psychology.

22:38.160 --> 22:44.480
 And I always thought computer scientists will be the best future psychologists in a sense

22:44.480 --> 22:51.680
 that data is, especially in this modern world, the data is a really powerful way to understand

22:51.680 --> 22:53.360
 and study human behavior.

22:53.360 --> 22:56.720
 And you've explored that with your game theory side of work as well.

22:56.720 --> 23:01.680
 Yeah, I'd like to think that what you say is true about computer scientists and psychology

23:02.240 --> 23:07.520
 from my own limited wandering into human subject experiments.

23:07.520 --> 23:11.600
 We have a great deal to learn, not just computer science, but AI and machine learning more

23:11.600 --> 23:17.040
 specifically, I kind of think of as imperialist research communities in that, you know, kind

23:17.040 --> 23:22.800
 of like physicists in an earlier generation, computer scientists kind of don't think of

23:22.800 --> 23:25.440
 any scientific topic that's off limits to them.

23:25.440 --> 23:30.880
 They will like freely wander into areas that others have been thinking about for decades

23:30.880 --> 23:31.440
 or longer.

23:31.440 --> 23:37.840
 And, you know, we usually tend to embarrass ourselves in those efforts for some amount

23:37.840 --> 23:38.320
 of time.

23:38.320 --> 23:41.840
 Like, you know, I think reinforcement learning is a good example, right?

23:41.840 --> 23:48.160
 So a lot of the early work in reinforcement learning, I have complete sympathy for the

23:48.160 --> 23:53.120
 control theorists that looked at this and said like, okay, you are reinventing stuff

23:53.120 --> 23:55.600
 that we've known since like the forties, right?

23:55.600 --> 24:01.120
 But, you know, in my view, eventually this sort of, you know, computer scientists have

24:01.120 --> 24:06.320
 made significant contributions to that field, even though we kind of embarrassed ourselves

24:06.320 --> 24:07.520
 for the first decade.

24:07.520 --> 24:12.080
 So I think if computer scientists are gonna start engaging in kind of psychology, human

24:12.080 --> 24:18.080
 subjects type of research, we should expect to be embarrassing ourselves for a good 10

24:18.080 --> 24:23.600
 years or so, and then hope that it turns out as well as, you know, some other areas that

24:23.600 --> 24:25.600
 we've waded into.

24:25.600 --> 24:30.400
 So you kind of mentioned this, just to linger on the idea of an ethical algorithm, of idea

24:30.400 --> 24:33.760
 of groups, sort of group thinking and individual thinking.

24:33.760 --> 24:35.040
 And we're struggling that.

24:35.040 --> 24:39.280
 One of the amazing things about algorithms and your book and just this field of study

24:39.280 --> 24:46.640
 is it gets us to ask, like forcing machines, converting these ideas into algorithms is

24:46.640 --> 24:50.160
 forcing us to ask questions of ourselves as a human civilization.

24:50.160 --> 24:58.320
 So there's a lot of people now in public discourse doing sort of group thinking, thinking like

24:58.320 --> 25:02.000
 there's particular sets of groups that we don't wanna discriminate against and so on.

25:02.000 --> 25:08.560
 And then there is individuals, sort of in the individual life stories, the struggles

25:08.560 --> 25:10.000
 they went through and so on.

25:10.000 --> 25:16.480
 Now, like in philosophy, it's easier to do group thinking because you don't, it's very

25:16.480 --> 25:17.920
 hard to think about individuals.

25:17.920 --> 25:23.840
 There's so much variability, but with data, you can start to actually say, you know what

25:23.840 --> 25:26.400
 group thinking is too crude.

25:26.400 --> 25:30.880
 You're actually doing more discrimination by thinking in terms of groups and individuals.

25:30.880 --> 25:36.720
 Can you linger on that kind of idea of group versus individual and ethics?

25:36.720 --> 25:41.680
 And is it good to continue thinking in terms of groups in algorithms?

25:41.680 --> 25:49.360
 So let me start by answering a very good high level question with a slightly narrow technical

25:49.360 --> 25:54.480
 response, which is these group definitions of fairness, like here's a few groups, like

25:54.480 --> 25:59.440
 different racial groups, maybe gender groups, maybe age, what have you.

25:59.440 --> 26:06.480
 And let's make sure that for none of these groups, do we have a false negative rate,

26:06.480 --> 26:09.200
 which is much higher than any other one of these groups.

26:09.200 --> 26:13.760
 Okay, so these are kind of classic group aggregate notions of fairness.

26:13.760 --> 26:18.000
 And you know, but at the end of the day, an individual you can think of as a combination

26:18.000 --> 26:19.360
 of all of their attributes, right?

26:19.360 --> 26:26.800
 They're a member of a racial group, they have a gender, they have an age, and many other

26:26.800 --> 26:33.840
 demographic properties that are not biological, but that are still very strong determinants

26:33.840 --> 26:36.720
 of outcome and personality and the like.

26:36.720 --> 26:43.920
 So one, I think, useful spectrum is to sort of think about that array between the group

26:43.920 --> 26:49.600
 and the specific individual, and to realize that in some ways, asking for fairness at

26:49.600 --> 26:56.800
 the individual level is to sort of ask for group fairness simultaneously for all possible

26:56.800 --> 26:57.840
 combinations of groups.

26:57.840 --> 27:06.480
 So in particular, you know, if I build a predictive model that meets some definition of fairness,

27:06.480 --> 27:14.160
 definition of fairness by race, by gender, by age, by what have you, marginally, to get

27:14.160 --> 27:20.960
 it slightly technical, sort of independently, I shouldn't expect that model to not discriminate

27:20.960 --> 27:27.440
 against disabled Hispanic women over age 55, making less than $50,000 a year annually,

27:27.440 --> 27:32.480
 even though I might have protected each one of those attributes marginally.

27:32.480 --> 27:35.680
 So the optimization, actually, that's a fascinating way to put it.

27:35.680 --> 27:42.160
 So you're just optimizing, the one way to achieve the optimizing fairness for individuals

27:42.160 --> 27:46.080
 is just to add more and more definitions of groups that each individual belongs to.

27:46.080 --> 27:47.080
 That's right.

27:47.080 --> 27:50.320
 So, you know, at the end of the day, we could think of all of ourselves as groups of size

27:50.320 --> 27:55.400
 one because eventually there's some attribute that separates you from me and everybody else

27:55.400 --> 27:57.020
 in the world, okay?

27:57.020 --> 28:03.560
 And so it is possible to put, you know, these incredibly coarse ways of thinking about fairness

28:03.560 --> 28:09.960
 and these very, very individualistic specific ways on a common scale.

28:09.960 --> 28:14.160
 And you know, one of the things we've worked on from a research perspective is, you know,

28:14.160 --> 28:20.520
 so we sort of know how to, you know, in relative terms, we know how to provide fairness guarantees

28:20.520 --> 28:22.760
 at the core system of the scale.

28:22.760 --> 28:28.240
 We don't know how to provide kind of sensible, tractable, realistic fairness guarantees at

28:28.240 --> 28:33.120
 the individual level, but maybe we could start creeping towards that by dealing with more

28:33.120 --> 28:35.040
 refined subgroups.

28:35.040 --> 28:41.000
 I mean, we gave a name to this phenomenon where, you know, you protect, you enforce

28:41.000 --> 28:46.580
 some definition of fairness for a bunch of marginal attributes or features, but then

28:46.580 --> 28:49.980
 you find yourself discriminating against a combination of them.

28:49.980 --> 28:55.480
 We call that fairness gerrymandering because like political gerrymandering, you know, you're

28:55.480 --> 29:01.400
 giving some guarantee at the aggregate level, but when you kind of look in a more granular

29:01.400 --> 29:06.440
 way at what's going on, you realize that you're achieving that aggregate guarantee by sort

29:06.440 --> 29:10.880
 of favoring some groups and discriminating against other ones.

29:10.880 --> 29:15.940
 And so there are, you know, it's early days, but there are algorithmic approaches that

29:15.940 --> 29:22.440
 let you start creeping towards that, you know, individual end of the spectrum.

29:22.440 --> 29:30.740
 Does there need to be human input in the form of weighing the value of the importance of

29:30.740 --> 29:33.000
 each kind of group?

29:33.000 --> 29:42.400
 So for example, is it like, so gender, say crudely speaking, male and female, and then

29:42.400 --> 29:51.980
 different races, are we as humans supposed to put value on saying gender is 0.6 and race

29:51.980 --> 29:59.200
 is 0.4 in terms of in the big optimization of achieving fairness?

29:59.200 --> 30:01.720
 Is that kind of what humans are supposed to do here?

30:01.720 --> 30:05.320
 I mean, of course, you know, I don't need to tell you that, of course, technically one

30:05.320 --> 30:10.720
 could incorporate such weights if you wanted to into a definition of fairness.

30:10.720 --> 30:19.680
 You know, fairness is an interesting topic in that having worked in the book being about

30:19.680 --> 30:24.820
 both fairness, privacy, and many other social norms, fairness, of course, is a much, much

30:24.820 --> 30:27.160
 more loaded topic.

30:27.160 --> 30:32.180
 So privacy, I mean, people want privacy, people don't like violations of privacy, violations

30:32.180 --> 30:40.680
 of privacy cause damage, angst, and bad publicity for the companies that are victims of them.

30:40.680 --> 30:48.020
 But sort of everybody agrees more data privacy would be better than less data privacy.

30:48.020 --> 30:53.780
 And you don't have these, somehow the discussions of fairness don't become politicized along

30:53.780 --> 31:01.900
 other dimensions like race and about gender and, you know, whether we, and, you know,

31:01.900 --> 31:10.760
 you quickly find yourselves kind of revisiting topics that have been kind of unresolved forever,

31:10.760 --> 31:12.560
 like affirmative action, right?

31:12.560 --> 31:16.400
 Sort of, you know, like, why are you protecting, and some people will say, why are you protecting

31:16.400 --> 31:20.320
 this particular racial group?

31:20.320 --> 31:26.240
 And others will say, well, we need to do that as a matter of retribution.

31:26.240 --> 31:30.040
 Other people will say, it's a matter of economic opportunity.

31:30.040 --> 31:34.920
 And I don't know which of, you know, whether any of these are the right answers, but you

31:34.920 --> 31:39.840
 sort of, fairness is sort of special in that as soon as you start talking about it, you

31:39.840 --> 31:46.360
 inevitably have to participate in debates about fair to whom, at what expense to who

31:46.360 --> 31:47.360
 else.

31:47.360 --> 31:56.180
 I mean, even in criminal justice, right, you know, where people talk about fairness in

31:56.180 --> 32:02.840
 criminal sentencing or, you know, predicting failures to appear or making parole decisions

32:02.840 --> 32:08.340
 or the like, they will, you know, they'll point out that, well, these definitions of

32:08.340 --> 32:13.640
 fairness are all about fairness for the criminals.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.120
 And what about fairness for the victims, right?

32:16.120 --> 32:22.840
 So when I basically say something like, well, the false incarceration rate for black people

32:22.840 --> 32:28.300
 and white people needs to be roughly the same, you know, there's no mention of potential

32:28.300 --> 32:33.180
 victims of criminals in such a fairness definition.

32:33.180 --> 32:34.960
 And that's the realm of public discourse.

32:34.960 --> 32:41.200
 I should actually recommend, I just listened to people listening, Intelligence Squares

32:41.200 --> 32:45.080
 debates, US edition just had a debate.

32:45.080 --> 32:50.080
 They have this structure where you have old Oxford style or whatever they're called, debates,

32:50.080 --> 32:55.680
 you know, it's two versus two and they talked about affirmative action and it was incredibly

32:55.680 --> 33:03.000
 interesting that there's really good points on every side of this issue, which is fascinating

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
 to listen to.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.680
 Yeah, yeah, I agree.

33:05.680 --> 33:12.400
 And so it's interesting to be a researcher trying to do, for the most part, technical

33:12.400 --> 33:17.980
 algorithmic work, but Aaron and I both quickly learned you cannot do that and then go out

33:17.980 --> 33:22.640
 and talk about it and expect people to take it seriously if you're unwilling to engage

33:22.640 --> 33:28.160
 in these broader debates that are entirely extra algorithmic, right?

33:28.160 --> 33:31.200
 They're not about, you know, algorithms and making algorithms better.

33:31.200 --> 33:35.160
 They're sort of, you know, as you said, sort of like, what should society be protecting

33:35.160 --> 33:36.160
 in the first place?

33:36.160 --> 33:42.320
 When you discuss the fairness, an algorithm that achieves fairness, whether in the constraints

33:42.320 --> 33:48.520
 and the objective function, there's an immediate kind of analysis you can perform, which is

33:48.520 --> 33:56.520
 saying, if you care about fairness in gender, this is the amount that you have to pay for

33:56.520 --> 33:59.280
 it in terms of the performance of the system.

33:59.280 --> 34:03.960
 Like do you, is there a role for statements like that in a table, in a paper, or do you

34:03.960 --> 34:06.680
 want to really not touch that?

34:06.680 --> 34:09.800
 No, no, we want to touch that and we do touch it.

34:09.800 --> 34:16.680
 So I mean, just again, to make sure I'm not promising your viewers more than we know how

34:16.680 --> 34:21.760
 to provide, but if you pick a definition of fairness, like I'm worried about gender discrimination

34:21.760 --> 34:27.100
 and you pick a notion of harm, like false rejection for a loan, for example, and you

34:27.100 --> 34:30.960
 give me a model, I can definitely, first of all, go audit that model.

34:30.960 --> 34:36.640
 It's easy for me to go, you know, from data to kind of say like, okay, your false rejection

34:36.640 --> 34:41.880
 rate on women is this much higher than it is on men, okay?

34:41.880 --> 34:47.240
 But once you also put the fairness into your objective function, I mean, I think the table

34:47.240 --> 34:51.640
 that you're talking about is what we would call the Pareto curve, right?

34:51.640 --> 34:58.740
 You can literally trace out, and we give examples of such plots on real data sets in the book,

34:58.740 --> 34:59.760
 you have two axes.

34:59.760 --> 35:06.360
 On the X axis is your error, on the Y axis is unfairness by whatever, you know, if it's

35:06.360 --> 35:12.240
 like the disparity between false rejection rates between two groups.

35:12.240 --> 35:17.080
 And you know, your algorithm now has a knob that basically says, how strongly do I want

35:17.080 --> 35:19.400
 to enforce fairness?

35:19.400 --> 35:24.680
 And the less unfair, you know, if the two axes are error and unfairness, we'd like to

35:24.680 --> 35:26.260
 be at zero, zero.

35:26.260 --> 35:31.280
 We'd like zero error and zero unfairness simultaneously.

35:31.280 --> 35:34.840
 Anybody who works in machine learning knows that you're generally not going to get to

35:34.840 --> 35:38.840
 zero error period without any fairness constraint whatsoever.

35:38.840 --> 35:41.060
 So that's not going to happen.

35:41.060 --> 35:46.480
 But in general, you know, you'll get this, you'll get some kind of convex curve that

35:46.480 --> 35:49.960
 specifies the numerical trade off you face.

35:49.960 --> 35:57.920
 You know, if I want to go from 17% error down to 16% error, what will be the increase in

35:57.920 --> 36:02.960
 unfairness that I experienced as a result of that?

36:02.960 --> 36:09.520
 And so this curve kind of specifies the, you know, kind of undominated models.

36:09.520 --> 36:14.480
 Models that are off that curve are, you know, can be strictly improved in one or both dimensions.

36:14.480 --> 36:18.840
 You can, you know, either make the error better or the unfairness better or both.

36:18.840 --> 36:26.000
 And I think our view is that not only are these objects, these Pareto curves, you know,

36:26.000 --> 36:34.360
 with efficient frontiers as you might call them, not only are they valuable scientific

36:34.360 --> 36:41.320
 objects, I actually think that they in the near term might need to be the interface between

36:41.320 --> 36:46.180
 researchers working in the field and stakeholders in given problems.

36:46.180 --> 36:55.320
 So you know, you could really imagine telling a criminal jurisdiction, look, if you're concerned

36:55.320 --> 36:58.820
 about racial fairness, but you're also concerned about accuracy.

36:58.820 --> 37:05.200
 You want to, you know, you want to release on parole people that are not going to recommit

37:05.200 --> 37:08.600
 a violent crime and you don't want to release the ones who are.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.600
 So you know, that's accuracy.

37:10.600 --> 37:15.120
 But if you also care about those, you know, the mistakes you make not being disproportionately

37:15.120 --> 37:19.160
 on one racial group or another, you can show this curve.

37:19.160 --> 37:23.980
 I'm hoping that in the near future, it'll be possible to explain these curves to non

37:23.980 --> 37:29.520
 technical people that are the ones that have to make the decision, where do we want to

37:29.520 --> 37:30.520
 be on this curve?

37:30.520 --> 37:38.440
 Like, what are the relative merits or value of having lower error versus lower unfairness?

37:38.440 --> 37:43.560
 You know, that's not something computer scientists should be deciding for society, right?

37:43.560 --> 37:49.400
 That, you know, the people in the field, so to speak, the policymakers, the regulators,

37:49.400 --> 37:51.680
 that's who should be making these decisions.

37:51.680 --> 37:56.600
 But I think and hope that they can be made to understand that these trade offs generally

37:56.600 --> 38:03.280
 exist and that you need to pick a point and like, and ignoring the trade off, you know,

38:03.280 --> 38:06.760
 you're implicitly picking a point anyway, right?

38:06.760 --> 38:09.400
 You just don't know it and you're not admitting it.

38:09.400 --> 38:12.740
 Just to linger on the point of trade offs, I think that's a really important thing to

38:12.740 --> 38:15.400
 sort of think about.

38:15.400 --> 38:22.360
 So you think when we start to optimize for fairness, there's almost always in most system

38:22.360 --> 38:25.080
 going to be trade offs.

38:25.080 --> 38:30.200
 Can you like, what's the trade off between just to clarify, there have been some sort

38:30.200 --> 38:39.240
 of technical terms thrown around, but sort of a perfectly fair world.

38:39.240 --> 38:40.760
 Why is that?

38:40.760 --> 38:43.760
 Why will somebody be upset about that?

38:43.760 --> 38:47.400
 The specific trade off I talked about just in order to make things very concrete was

38:47.400 --> 38:53.360
 between numerical error and some numerical measure of unfairness.

38:53.360 --> 38:56.400
 What is numerical error in the case of...

38:56.400 --> 39:01.000
 Just like say predictive error, like, you know, the probability or frequency with which

39:01.000 --> 39:08.480
 you release somebody on parole who then goes on to recommit a violent crime or keep incarcerated

39:08.480 --> 39:10.920
 somebody who would not have recommitted a violent crime.

39:10.920 --> 39:17.480
 So in the case of awarding somebody parole or giving somebody parole or letting them

39:17.480 --> 39:21.480
 out on parole, you don't want them to recommit a crime.

39:21.480 --> 39:26.600
 So it's your system failed in prediction if they happen to do a crime.

39:26.600 --> 39:30.280
 Okay, so that's one axis.

39:30.280 --> 39:31.800
 And what's the fairness axis?

39:31.800 --> 39:39.640
 So then the fairness axis might be the difference between racial groups in the kind of false

39:39.640 --> 39:47.840
 positive predictions, namely people that I kept incarcerated predicting that they would

39:47.840 --> 39:51.200
 recommit a violent crime when in fact they wouldn't have.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.200
 Right.

39:52.200 --> 40:00.840
 And the unfairness of that, just to linger it and allow me to in eloquently to try to

40:00.840 --> 40:06.360
 sort of describe why that's unfair, why unfairness is there.

40:06.360 --> 40:13.280
 The unfairness you want to get rid of is that in the judge's mind, the bias of having being

40:13.280 --> 40:18.480
 brought up to society, the slight racial bias, the racism that exists in the society, you

40:18.480 --> 40:21.760
 want to remove that from the system.

40:21.760 --> 40:28.720
 Another way that's been debated is sort of equality of opportunity versus equality of

40:28.720 --> 40:30.440
 outcome.

40:30.440 --> 40:35.120
 And there's a weird dance there that's really difficult to get right.

40:35.120 --> 40:40.200
 And we don't, affirmative action is exploring that space.

40:40.200 --> 40:41.200
 Right.

40:41.200 --> 40:48.840
 And then this also quickly bleeds into questions like, well, maybe if one group really does

40:48.840 --> 40:55.240
 recommit crimes at a higher rate, the reason for that is that at some earlier point in

40:55.240 --> 41:00.200
 the pipeline or earlier in their lives, they didn't receive the same resources that the

41:00.200 --> 41:02.560
 other group did.

41:02.560 --> 41:08.480
 And so there's always in kind of fairness discussions, the possibility that the real

41:08.480 --> 41:11.040
 injustice came earlier, right?

41:11.040 --> 41:16.360
 Earlier in this individual's life, earlier in this group's history, et cetera, et cetera.

41:16.360 --> 41:20.840
 And so a lot of the fairness discussion is almost, the goal is for it to be a corrective

41:20.840 --> 41:25.440
 mechanism to account for the injustice earlier in life.

41:25.440 --> 41:29.640
 By some definitions of fairness or some theories of fairness, yeah.

41:29.640 --> 41:35.120
 Others would say like, look, it's not to correct that injustice, it's just to kind of level

41:35.120 --> 41:40.720
 the playing field right now and not falsely incarcerate more people of one group than

41:40.720 --> 41:41.720
 another group.

41:41.720 --> 41:46.960
 But I mean, I think just it might be helpful just to demystify a little bit about the many

41:46.960 --> 41:54.940
 ways in which bias or unfairness can come into algorithms, especially in the machine

41:54.940 --> 41:55.940
 learning era, right?

41:55.940 --> 42:00.680
 I think many of your viewers have probably heard these examples before, but let's say

42:00.680 --> 42:04.160
 I'm building a face recognition system, right?

42:04.160 --> 42:12.000
 And so I'm kind of gathering lots of images of faces and trying to train the system to

42:12.000 --> 42:17.340
 recognize new faces of those individuals from training on a training set of those faces

42:17.340 --> 42:19.080
 of individuals.

42:19.080 --> 42:24.860
 And it shouldn't surprise anybody or certainly not anybody in the field of machine learning

42:24.860 --> 42:34.960
 if my training data set was primarily white males and I'm training the model to maximize

42:34.960 --> 42:44.060
 the overall accuracy on my training data set, that the model can reduce its error most by

42:44.060 --> 42:48.800
 getting things right on the white males that constitute the majority of the data set, even

42:48.800 --> 42:53.640
 if that means that on other groups, they will be less accurate, okay?

42:53.640 --> 42:57.720
 Now, there's a bunch of ways you could think about addressing this.

42:57.720 --> 43:05.760
 One is to deliberately put into the objective of the algorithm not to optimize the error

43:05.760 --> 43:09.060
 at the expense of this discrimination, and then you're kind of back in the land of these

43:09.060 --> 43:13.140
 kind of two dimensional numerical trade offs.

43:13.140 --> 43:18.660
 A valid counter argument is to say like, well, no, you don't have to, there's no, you know,

43:18.660 --> 43:22.840
 the notion of the tension between error and accuracy here is a false one.

43:22.840 --> 43:27.760
 You could instead just go out and get much more data on these other groups that are in

43:27.760 --> 43:34.580
 the minority and, you know, equalize your data set, or you could train a separate model

43:34.580 --> 43:38.800
 on those subgroups and, you know, have multiple models.

43:38.800 --> 43:43.120
 The point I think we would, you know, we tried to make in the book is that those things have

43:43.120 --> 43:45.160
 cost too, right?

43:45.160 --> 43:51.200
 Going out and gathering more data on groups that are relatively rare compared to your

43:51.200 --> 43:55.520
 plurality or more majority group that, you know, it may not cost you in the accuracy

43:55.520 --> 43:59.460
 of the model, but it's going to cost, you know, it's going to cost the company developing

43:59.460 --> 44:04.460
 this model more money to develop that, and it also costs more money to build separate

44:04.460 --> 44:07.500
 predictive models and to implement and deploy them.

44:07.500 --> 44:14.100
 So even if you can find a way to avoid the tension between error and accuracy in training

44:14.100 --> 44:20.720
 a model, you might push the cost somewhere else, like money, like development time, research

44:20.720 --> 44:22.920
 time and the like.

44:22.920 --> 44:30.200
 There are fundamentally difficult philosophical questions, in fairness, and we live in a very

44:30.200 --> 44:34.160
 divisive political climate, outraged culture.

44:34.160 --> 44:38.560
 There is alt right folks on 4chan, trolls.

44:38.560 --> 44:43.320
 There is social justice warriors on Twitter.

44:43.320 --> 44:49.920
 There's very divisive, outraged folks on all sides of every kind of system.

44:49.920 --> 44:57.280
 How do you, how do we as engineers build ethical algorithms in such divisive culture?

44:57.280 --> 44:59.540
 Do you think they could be disjoint?

44:59.540 --> 45:04.700
 The human has to inject your values, and then you can optimize over those values.

45:04.700 --> 45:09.560
 But in our times, when you start actually applying these systems, things get a little

45:09.560 --> 45:13.100
 bit challenging for the public discourse.

45:13.100 --> 45:14.920
 How do you think we can proceed?

45:14.920 --> 45:21.000
 Yeah, I mean, for the most part in the book, a point that we try to take some pains to

45:21.000 --> 45:29.560
 make is that we don't view ourselves or people like us as being in the position of deciding

45:29.560 --> 45:34.960
 for society what the right social norms are, what the right definitions of fairness are.

45:34.960 --> 45:41.660
 Our main point is to just show that if society or the relevant stakeholders in a particular

45:41.660 --> 45:47.160
 domain can come to agreement on those sorts of things, there's a way of encoding that

45:47.160 --> 45:50.720
 into algorithms in many cases, not in all cases.

45:50.720 --> 45:55.640
 One other misconception that hopefully we definitely dispel is sometimes people read

45:55.640 --> 46:00.880
 the title of the book and I think not unnaturally fear that what we're suggesting is that the

46:00.880 --> 46:05.760
 algorithms themselves should decide what those social norms are and develop their own notions

46:05.760 --> 46:10.160
 of fairness and privacy or ethics, and we're definitely not suggesting that.

46:10.160 --> 46:13.920
 The title of the book is Ethical Algorithm, by the way, and I didn't think of that interpretation

46:13.920 --> 46:14.920
 of the title.

46:14.920 --> 46:15.920
 That's interesting.

46:15.920 --> 46:16.920
 Yeah, yeah.

46:16.920 --> 46:21.080
 I mean, especially these days where people are concerned about the robots becoming our

46:21.080 --> 46:25.980
 overlords, the idea that the robots would also sort of develop their own social norms

46:25.980 --> 46:29.360
 is just one step away from that.

46:29.360 --> 46:35.240
 But I do think, obviously, despite disclaimer that people like us shouldn't be making those

46:35.240 --> 46:40.880
 decisions for society, we are kind of living in a world where in many ways computer scientists

46:40.880 --> 46:46.820
 have made some decisions that have fundamentally changed the nature of our society and democracy

46:46.820 --> 46:53.240
 and sort of civil discourse and deliberation in ways that I think most people generally

46:53.240 --> 46:55.720
 feel are bad these days, right?

46:55.720 --> 47:01.120
 But they had to make, so if we look at people at the heads of companies and so on, they

47:01.120 --> 47:02.800
 had to make those decisions, right?

47:02.800 --> 47:08.440
 There has to be decisions, so there's two options, either you kind of put your head

47:08.440 --> 47:14.000
 in the sand and don't think about these things and just let the algorithm do what it does,

47:14.000 --> 47:19.320
 or you make decisions about what you value, you know, of injecting moral values into the

47:19.320 --> 47:20.320
 algorithm.

47:20.320 --> 47:26.760
 Look, I never mean to be an apologist for the tech industry, but I think it's a little

47:26.760 --> 47:31.120
 bit too far to sort of say that explicit decisions were made about these things.

47:31.120 --> 47:34.920
 So let's, for instance, take social media platforms, right?

47:34.920 --> 47:40.160
 So like many inventions in technology and computer science, a lot of these platforms

47:40.160 --> 47:45.120
 that we now use regularly kind of started as curiosities, right?

47:45.120 --> 47:49.240
 I remember when things like Facebook came out and its predecessors like Friendster,

47:49.240 --> 47:55.620
 which nobody even remembers now, people really wonder, like, why would anybody want to spend

47:55.620 --> 47:56.620
 time doing that?

47:56.620 --> 48:01.480
 I mean, even the web when it first came out, when it wasn't populated with much content

48:01.480 --> 48:07.100
 and it was largely kind of hobbyists building their own kind of ramshackle websites, a lot

48:07.100 --> 48:09.960
 of people looked at this and said, well, what is the purpose of this thing?

48:09.960 --> 48:11.000
 Why is this interesting?

48:11.000 --> 48:12.880
 Who would want to do this?

48:12.880 --> 48:18.120
 And so even things like Facebook and Twitter, yes, technical decisions were made by engineers,

48:18.120 --> 48:23.520
 by scientists, by executives in the design of those platforms, but, you know, I don't

48:23.520 --> 48:32.240
 think 10 years ago anyone anticipated that those platforms, for instance, might kind

48:32.240 --> 48:42.200
 of acquire undue, you know, influence on political discourse or on the outcomes of elections.

48:42.200 --> 48:47.600
 And I think the scrutiny that these companies are getting now is entirely appropriate, but

48:47.600 --> 48:53.080
 I think it's a little too harsh to kind of look at history and sort of say like, oh,

48:53.080 --> 48:56.320
 you should have been able to anticipate that this would happen with your platform.

48:56.320 --> 49:00.600
 And in this sort of gaming chapter of the book, one of the points we're making is that,

49:00.600 --> 49:05.200
 you know, these platforms, right, they don't operate in isolation.

49:05.200 --> 49:09.360
 So unlike the other topics we're discussing, like fairness and privacy, like those are

49:09.360 --> 49:13.600
 really cases where algorithms can operate on your data and make decisions about you

49:13.600 --> 49:16.300
 and you're not even aware of it, okay?

49:16.300 --> 49:20.280
 Things like Facebook and Twitter, these are, you know, these are systems, right?

49:20.280 --> 49:25.960
 These are social systems and their evolution, even their technical evolution because machine

49:25.960 --> 49:31.680
 learning is involved, is driven in no small part by the behavior of the users themselves

49:31.680 --> 49:35.680
 and how the users decide to adopt them and how to use them.

49:35.680 --> 49:44.600
 And so, you know, I'm kind of like who really knew that, you know, until we saw it happen,

49:44.600 --> 49:48.340
 who knew that these things might be able to influence the outcome of elections?

49:48.340 --> 49:55.120
 Who knew that, you know, they might polarize political discourse because of the ability

49:55.120 --> 50:00.840
 to, you know, decide who you interact with on the platform and also with the platform

50:00.840 --> 50:05.080
 naturally using machine learning to optimize for your own interest that they would further

50:05.080 --> 50:10.080
 isolate us from each other and, you know, like feed us all basically just the stuff

50:10.080 --> 50:12.080
 that we already agreed with.

50:12.080 --> 50:18.120
 So I think, you know, we've come to that outcome, I think, largely, but I think it's

50:18.120 --> 50:24.240
 something that we all learned together, including the companies as these things happen.

50:24.240 --> 50:29.940
 You asked like, well, are there algorithmic remedies to these kinds of things?

50:29.940 --> 50:35.360
 And again, these are big problems that are not going to be solved with, you know, somebody

50:35.360 --> 50:40.040
 going in and changing a few lines of code somewhere in a social media platform.

50:40.040 --> 50:44.960
 But I do think in many ways, there are definitely ways of making things better.

50:44.960 --> 50:49.360
 I mean, like an obvious recommendation that we make at some point in the book is like,

50:49.360 --> 50:55.280
 look, you know, to the extent that we think that machine learning applied for personalization

50:55.280 --> 51:03.480
 purposes in things like newsfeed, you know, or other platforms has led to polarization

51:03.480 --> 51:07.940
 and intolerance of opposing viewpoints.

51:07.940 --> 51:11.880
 As you know, right, these algorithms have models, right, and they kind of place people

51:11.880 --> 51:17.700
 in some kind of metric space, and they place content in that space, and they sort of know

51:17.700 --> 51:22.180
 the extent to which I have an affinity for a particular type of content.

51:22.180 --> 51:26.400
 And by the same token, they also probably have that same model probably gives you a

51:26.400 --> 51:32.760
 good idea of the stuff I'm likely to violently disagree with or be offended by, okay?

51:32.760 --> 51:37.440
 So you know, in this case, there really is some knob you could tune that says like, instead

51:37.440 --> 51:43.040
 of showing people only what they like and what they want, let's show them some stuff

51:43.040 --> 51:46.160
 that we think that they don't like, or that's a little bit further away.

51:46.160 --> 51:51.680
 And you could even imagine users being able to control this, you know, just like everybody

51:51.680 --> 51:58.240
 gets a slider, and that slider says like, you know, how much stuff do you want to see

51:58.240 --> 52:02.960
 that's kind of, you know, you might disagree with, or is at least further from your interest.

52:02.960 --> 52:05.720
 It's almost like an exploration button.

52:05.720 --> 52:08.360
 So just get your intuition.

52:08.360 --> 52:15.160
 Do you think engagement, so like you staying on the platform, you're staying engaged.

52:15.160 --> 52:19.920
 Do you think fairness, ideas of fairness won't emerge?

52:19.920 --> 52:23.740
 Like how bad is it to just optimize for engagement?

52:23.740 --> 52:28.440
 Do you think we'll run into big trouble if we're just optimizing for how much you love

52:28.440 --> 52:29.440
 the platform?

52:29.440 --> 52:34.800
 Well, I mean, optimizing for engagement kind of got us where we are.

52:34.800 --> 52:39.960
 So do you, one, have faith that it's possible to do better?

52:39.960 --> 52:44.240
 And two, if it is, how do we do better?

52:44.240 --> 52:47.060
 I mean, it's definitely possible to do different, right?

52:47.060 --> 52:51.700
 And again, you know, it's not as if I think that doing something different than optimizing

52:51.700 --> 52:57.880
 for engagement won't cost these companies in real ways, including revenue and profitability

52:57.880 --> 52:58.880
 potentially.

52:58.880 --> 53:00.600
 In the short term at least.

53:00.600 --> 53:01.600
 Yeah.

53:01.600 --> 53:02.600
 In the short term.

53:02.600 --> 53:03.600
 Right.

53:03.600 --> 53:08.920
 And again, you know, if I worked at these companies, I'm sure that it would have seemed

53:08.920 --> 53:12.640
 like the most natural thing in the world also to want to optimize engagement, right?

53:12.640 --> 53:14.600
 And that's good for users in some sense.

53:14.600 --> 53:19.600
 You want them to be, you know, vested in the platform and enjoying it and finding it useful,

53:19.600 --> 53:21.660
 interesting, and or productive.

53:21.660 --> 53:27.080
 But you know, my point is, is that the idea that there is, that it's sort of out of their

53:27.080 --> 53:31.560
 hands as you said, or that there's nothing to do about it, never say never, but that

53:31.560 --> 53:34.560
 strikes me as implausible as a machine learning person, right?

53:34.560 --> 53:39.600
 I mean, these companies are driven by machine learning and this optimization of engagement

53:39.600 --> 53:42.040
 is essentially driven by machine learning, right?

53:42.040 --> 53:47.120
 It's driven by not just machine learning, but you know, very, very large scale A, B

53:47.120 --> 53:53.080
 experimentation where you kind of tweak some element of the user interface or tweak some

53:53.080 --> 53:59.520
 component of an algorithm or tweak some component or feature of your click through prediction

53:59.520 --> 54:01.200
 model.

54:01.200 --> 54:06.360
 And my point is, is that anytime you know how to optimize for something, you, you know,

54:06.360 --> 54:10.600
 by def, almost by definition, that solution tells you how not to optimize for it or to

54:10.600 --> 54:13.240
 do something different.

54:13.240 --> 54:16.200
 Engagement can be measured.

54:16.200 --> 54:25.320
 So sort of optimizing for sort of minimizing divisiveness or maximizing intellectual growth

54:25.320 --> 54:30.160
 over the lifetime of a human being are very difficult to measure.

54:30.160 --> 54:31.160
 That's right.

54:31.160 --> 54:38.240
 And I'm not claiming that doing something different will immediately make it apparent

54:38.240 --> 54:42.320
 that this is a good thing for society and in particular, I mean, I think one way of

54:42.320 --> 54:47.400
 thinking about where we are on some of these social media platforms is that, you know,

54:47.400 --> 54:50.880
 it kind of feels a bit like we're in a bad equilibrium, right?

54:50.880 --> 54:55.920
 That these systems are helping us all kind of optimize something myopically and selfishly

54:55.920 --> 55:02.280
 for ourselves and of course, from an individual standpoint at any given moment, like why would

55:02.280 --> 55:07.280
 I want to see things in my newsfeed that I found irrelevant, offensive or, you know,

55:07.280 --> 55:09.240
 or the like, okay?

55:09.240 --> 55:15.320
 But you know, maybe by all of us, you know, having these platforms myopically optimized

55:15.320 --> 55:20.920
 in our interests, we have reached a collective outcome as a society that we're unhappy with

55:20.920 --> 55:21.920
 in different ways.

55:21.920 --> 55:26.360
 Let's say with respect to things like, you know, political discourse and tolerance of

55:26.360 --> 55:28.160
 opposing viewpoints.

55:28.160 --> 55:34.840
 And if Mark Zuckerberg gave you a call and said, I'm thinking of taking a sabbatical,

55:34.840 --> 55:37.440
 could you run Facebook for me for six months?

55:37.440 --> 55:39.240
 What would you, how?

55:39.240 --> 55:45.720
 I think no thanks would be my first response, but there are many aspects of being the head

55:45.720 --> 55:51.200
 of the entire company that are kind of entirely exogenous to many of the things that we're

55:51.200 --> 55:52.200
 discussing here.

55:52.200 --> 55:53.200
 Yes.

55:53.200 --> 55:58.680
 And so I don't really think I would need to be CEO of Facebook to kind of implement the,

55:58.680 --> 56:02.720
 you know, more limited set of solutions that I might imagine.

56:02.720 --> 56:08.940
 But I think one concrete thing they could do is they could experiment with letting people

56:08.940 --> 56:17.020
 who chose to, to see more stuff in their newsfeed that is not entirely kind of chosen to optimize

56:17.020 --> 56:22.500
 for their particular interests, beliefs, et cetera.

56:22.500 --> 56:27.240
 So the, the kind of thing, so I could speak to YouTube, but I think Facebook probably

56:27.240 --> 56:34.880
 does something similar is they're quite effective at automatically finding what sorts of groups

56:34.880 --> 56:40.260
 you belong to, not based on race or gender or so on, but based on the kind of stuff you

56:40.260 --> 56:43.120
 enjoy watching in the case of YouTube.

56:43.120 --> 56:50.160
 Sort of, it's a, it's a difficult thing for Facebook or YouTube to then say, well, you

56:50.160 --> 56:51.160
 know what?

56:51.160 --> 56:54.700
 We're going to show you something from a very different cluster.

56:54.700 --> 57:00.020
 Even though we believe algorithmically, you're unlikely to enjoy that thing sort of that's

57:00.020 --> 57:02.340
 a weird jump to make.

57:02.340 --> 57:07.020
 There has to be a human, like at the very top of that system that says, well, that will

57:07.020 --> 57:09.840
 be longterm healthy for you.

57:09.840 --> 57:11.880
 That's more than an algorithmic decision.

57:11.880 --> 57:18.460
 Or that same person could say that'll be longterm healthy for the platform or for the platform's

57:18.460 --> 57:22.560
 influence on society outside of the platform, right?

57:22.560 --> 57:27.020
 And it, you know, it's easy for me to sit here and say these things, but conceptually

57:27.020 --> 57:32.920
 I do not think that these are kind of totally or should, they shouldn't be kind of completely

57:32.920 --> 57:34.800
 alien ideas, right?

57:34.800 --> 57:40.880
 That, you know, you could try things like this and it wouldn't be, you know, we wouldn't

57:40.880 --> 57:45.820
 have to invent entirely new science to do it because if we're all already embedded in

57:45.820 --> 57:50.520
 some metric space and there's a notion of distance between you and me and every other,

57:50.520 --> 57:56.060
 every piece of content, then, you know, we know exactly, you know, the same model that

57:56.060 --> 58:03.340
 tells, you know, dictates how to make me really happy also tells how to make me as unhappy

58:03.340 --> 58:04.960
 as possible as well.

58:04.960 --> 58:05.960
 Right.

58:05.960 --> 58:11.000
 The focus in your book and algorithmic fairness research today in general is on machine learning,

58:11.000 --> 58:16.800
 like we said, is data, but, and just even the entire AI field right now is captivated

58:16.800 --> 58:19.720
 with machine learning, with deep learning.

58:19.720 --> 58:25.480
 Do you think ideas in symbolic AI or totally other kinds of approaches are interesting,

58:25.480 --> 58:31.400
 useful in the space, have some promising ideas in terms of fairness?

58:31.400 --> 58:35.240
 I haven't thought about that question specifically in the context of fairness.

58:35.240 --> 58:39.040
 I definitely would agree with that statement in the large, right?

58:39.040 --> 58:46.840
 I mean, I am, you know, one of many machine learning researchers who do believe that the

58:46.840 --> 58:51.400
 great successes that have been shown in machine learning recently are great successes, but

58:51.400 --> 58:53.280
 they're on a pretty narrow set of tasks.

58:53.280 --> 59:00.480
 I mean, I don't, I don't think we're kind of notably closer to general artificial intelligence

59:00.480 --> 59:03.360
 now than we were when I started my career.

59:03.360 --> 59:08.640
 I mean, there's been progress and I do think that we are kind of as a community, maybe

59:08.640 --> 59:12.000
 looking a bit where the light is, but the light is shining pretty bright there right

59:12.000 --> 59:13.760
 now and we're finding a lot of stuff.

59:13.760 --> 59:18.520
 So I don't want to like argue with the progress that's been made in areas like deep learning,

59:18.520 --> 59:19.880
 for example.

59:19.880 --> 59:25.080
 This touches another sort of related thing that you mentioned and that people might misinterpret

59:25.080 --> 59:27.420
 from the title of your book, ethical algorithm.

59:27.420 --> 59:31.800
 Is it possible for the algorithm to automate some of those decisions?

59:31.800 --> 59:37.400
 Sort of a higher level decisions of what kind of, like what, what should be fair, what should

59:37.400 --> 59:38.720
 be fair.

59:38.720 --> 59:43.400
 The more you know about a field, the more aware you are of its limitations.

59:43.400 --> 59:47.840
 And so I'm a, I'm pretty leery of sort of trying, you know, there's, there's so much

59:47.840 --> 59:53.760
 we don't all, we already don't know in fairness, even when we're the ones picking the fairness

59:53.760 --> 59:58.960
 definitions and, you know, comparing alternatives and thinking about the tensions between different

59:58.960 --> 1:00:05.160
 definitions that the idea of kind of letting the algorithm start exploring as well.

1:00:05.160 --> 1:00:08.560
 I definitely think, you know, this is a much narrower statement.

1:00:08.560 --> 1:00:12.440
 I definitely think that kind of algorithmic auditing for different types of unfairness,

1:00:12.440 --> 1:00:13.440
 right?

1:00:13.440 --> 1:00:18.680
 So like in this gerrymandering example where I might want to prevent not just discrimination

1:00:18.680 --> 1:00:23.960
 against very broad categories, but against combinations of broad categories.

1:00:23.960 --> 1:00:27.700
 You know, you quickly get to a point where there's a lot of, a lot of categories.

1:00:27.700 --> 1:00:33.520
 There's a lot of combinations of end features and, you know, you can use algorithmic techniques

1:00:33.520 --> 1:00:38.000
 to sort of try to find the subgroups on which you're discriminating the most and try to

1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:39.000
 fix that.

1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:42.460
 That's actually kind of the form of one of the algorithms we developed for this fairness

1:00:42.460 --> 1:00:44.240
 gerrymandering problem.

1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:49.440
 But I'm, I'm, you know, partly because of our technological, you know, our sort of our

1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:53.400
 scientific ignorance on these topics right now.

1:00:53.400 --> 1:00:58.360
 And also partly just because these topics are so loaded emotionally for people that

1:00:58.360 --> 1:01:00.440
 I just don't see the value.

1:01:00.440 --> 1:01:03.920
 I mean, again, never say never, but I just don't think we're at a moment where it's

1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:08.600
 a great time for computer scientists to be rolling out the idea like, hey, you know,

1:01:08.600 --> 1:01:12.520
 you know, not only have we kind of figured fairness out, but, you know, we think the

1:01:12.520 --> 1:01:16.880
 algorithm should start deciding what's fair or giving input on that decision.

1:01:16.880 --> 1:01:22.080
 I just don't, it's like the cost benefit analysis to the field of kind of going there

1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:24.520
 right now just doesn't seem worth it to me.

1:01:24.520 --> 1:01:29.200
 That said, I should say that I think computer scientists should be more philosophically,

1:01:29.200 --> 1:01:32.280
 like should enrich their thinking about these kinds of things.

1:01:32.280 --> 1:01:38.020
 I think it's been too often used as an excuse for roboticists working on autonomous vehicles,

1:01:38.020 --> 1:01:43.720
 for example, to not think about the human factor or psychology or safety in the same

1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:47.440
 way like computer science design algorithms that have been sort of using it as an excuse.

1:01:47.440 --> 1:01:51.640
 And I think it's time for basically everybody to become a computer scientist.

1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:54.440
 I was about to agree with everything you said except that last point.

1:01:54.440 --> 1:01:59.760
 I think that the other way of looking at it is that I think computer scientists, you know,

1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:06.120
 and many of us are, but we need to weigh it out into the world more, right?

1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:12.520
 I mean, just the influence that computer science and therefore computer scientists have had

1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:21.520
 on society at large just like has exponentially magnified in the last 10 or 20 years or so.

1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:26.560
 And you know, before when we were just tinkering around amongst ourselves and it didn't matter

1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:32.360
 that much, there was no need for sort of computer scientists to be citizens of the world more

1:02:32.360 --> 1:02:33.440
 broadly.

1:02:33.440 --> 1:02:36.760
 And I think those days need to be over very, very fast.

1:02:36.760 --> 1:02:40.720
 And I'm not saying everybody needs to do it, but to me, like the right way of doing it

1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:44.120
 is to not to sort of think that everybody else is going to become a computer scientist.

1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:49.200
 But you know, I think people are becoming more sophisticated about computer science,

1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:50.200
 even lay people.

1:02:50.200 --> 1:02:55.520
 You know, I think one of the reasons we decided to write this book is we thought 10 years

1:02:55.520 --> 1:03:00.400
 ago I wouldn't have tried this just because I just didn't think that sort of people's

1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:06.240
 awareness of algorithms and machine learning, you know, the general population would have

1:03:06.240 --> 1:03:07.240
 been high.

1:03:07.240 --> 1:03:12.060
 I mean, you would have had to first, you know, write one of the many books kind of just explicating

1:03:12.060 --> 1:03:14.720
 that topic to a lay audience first.

1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:18.900
 Now I think we're at the point where like lots of people without any technical training

1:03:18.900 --> 1:03:22.800
 at all know enough about algorithms and machine learning that you can start getting to these

1:03:22.800 --> 1:03:26.000
 nuances of things like ethical algorithms.

1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:31.780
 I think we agree that there needs to be much more mixing, but I think a lot of the onus

1:03:31.780 --> 1:03:35.360
 of that mixing needs to be on the computer science community.

1:03:35.360 --> 1:03:36.360
 Yeah.

1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:41.920
 So just to linger on the disagreement, because I do disagree with you on the point that I

1:03:41.920 --> 1:03:50.780
 think if you're a biologist, if you're a chemist, if you're an MBA business person, all of those

1:03:50.780 --> 1:03:57.160
 things you can, like if you learned a program, and not only program, if you learned to do

1:03:57.160 --> 1:04:02.160
 machine learning, if you learned to do data science, you immediately become much more

1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:04.200
 powerful in the kinds of things you can do.

1:04:04.200 --> 1:04:11.600
 And therefore literature, like library sciences, like, so you were speaking, I think, I think

1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:14.760
 it holds true what you're saying for the next few years.

1:04:14.760 --> 1:04:21.520
 But long term, if you're interested to me, if you're interested in philosophy, you should

1:04:21.520 --> 1:04:27.700
 learn a program, because then you can scrape data and study what people are thinking about

1:04:27.700 --> 1:04:33.760
 on Twitter, and then start making philosophical conclusions about the meaning of life.

1:04:33.760 --> 1:04:41.440
 I just feel like the access to data, the digitization of whatever problem you're trying to solve,

1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:44.200
 will fundamentally change what it means to be a computer scientist.

1:04:44.200 --> 1:04:51.200
 I mean, a computer scientist in 20, 30 years will go back to being Donald Knuth style theoretical

1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:56.560
 computer science, and everybody would be doing basically, exploring the kinds of ideas that

1:04:56.560 --> 1:04:57.560
 you explore in your book.

1:04:57.560 --> 1:04:58.880
 It won't be a computer science major.

1:04:58.880 --> 1:05:05.000
 Yeah, I mean, I don't think I disagree enough, but I think that that trend of more and more

1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:11.600
 people in more and more disciplines adopting ideas from computer science, learning how

1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:14.560
 to code, I think that that trend seems firmly underway.

1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:21.000
 I mean, you know, like an interesting digressive question along these lines is maybe in 50

1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:27.080
 years, there won't be computer science departments anymore, because the field will just sort

1:05:27.080 --> 1:05:30.840
 of be ambient in all of the different disciplines.

1:05:30.840 --> 1:05:35.720
 And people will look back and having a computer science department will look like having an

1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:39.480
 electricity department or something that's like, you know, everybody uses this, it's

1:05:39.480 --> 1:05:40.480
 just out there.

1:05:40.480 --> 1:05:45.180
 I mean, I do think there will always be that kind of Knuth style core to it, but it's not

1:05:45.180 --> 1:05:50.180
 an implausible path that we kind of get to the point where the academic discipline of

1:05:50.180 --> 1:05:56.160
 computer science becomes somewhat marginalized because of its very success in kind of infiltrating

1:05:56.160 --> 1:06:00.720
 all of science and society and the humanities, etcetera.

1:06:00.720 --> 1:06:07.720
 What is differential privacy, or more broadly, algorithmic privacy?

1:06:07.720 --> 1:06:15.040
 Algorithmic privacy more broadly is just the study or the notion of privacy definitions

1:06:15.040 --> 1:06:19.580
 or norms being encoded inside of algorithms.

1:06:19.580 --> 1:06:27.520
 And so, you know, I think we count among this body of work just, you know, the literature

1:06:27.520 --> 1:06:33.980
 and practice of things like data anonymization, which we kind of at the beginning of our discussion

1:06:33.980 --> 1:06:38.600
 of privacy say like, okay, this is sort of a notion of algorithmic privacy.

1:06:38.600 --> 1:06:44.840
 It kind of tells you, you know, something to go do with data, but, you know, our view

1:06:44.840 --> 1:06:50.120
 is that it's, and I think this is now, you know, quite widespread, that it's, you know,

1:06:50.120 --> 1:06:57.320
 despite the fact that those notions of anonymization kind of redacting and coarsening are the most

1:06:57.320 --> 1:07:03.700
 widely adopted technical solutions for data privacy, they are like deeply fundamentally

1:07:03.700 --> 1:07:05.120
 flawed.

1:07:05.120 --> 1:07:11.240
 And so, you know, to your first question, what is differential privacy?

1:07:11.240 --> 1:07:16.680
 Differential privacy seems to be a much, much better notion of privacy that kind of avoids

1:07:16.680 --> 1:07:24.520
 a lot of the weaknesses of anonymization notions while still letting us do useful stuff with

1:07:24.520 --> 1:07:25.520
 data.

1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:27.480
 What is anonymization of data?

1:07:27.480 --> 1:07:34.000
 So by anonymization, I'm, you know, kind of referring to techniques like I have a database.

1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:40.240
 The rows of that database are, let's say, individual people's medical records, okay?

1:07:40.240 --> 1:07:43.840
 And I want to let people use that data.

1:07:43.840 --> 1:07:49.480
 Maybe I want to let researchers access that data to build predictive models for some disease,

1:07:49.480 --> 1:07:56.200
 but I'm worried that that will leak, you know, sensitive information about specific people's

1:07:56.200 --> 1:07:57.640
 medical records.

1:07:57.640 --> 1:08:01.680
 So anonymization broadly refers to the set of techniques where I say like, okay, I'm

1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:06.160
 first going to like, I'm going to delete the column with people's names.

1:08:06.160 --> 1:08:09.760
 I'm going to not put, you know, so that would be like a redaction, right?

1:08:09.760 --> 1:08:12.040
 I'm just redacting that information.

1:08:12.040 --> 1:08:17.040
 I am going to take ages and I'm not going to like say your exact age.

1:08:17.040 --> 1:08:23.120
 I'm going to say whether you're, you know, zero to 10, 10 to 20, 20 to 30, I might put

1:08:23.120 --> 1:08:27.520
 the first three digits of your zip code, but not the last two, et cetera, et cetera.

1:08:27.520 --> 1:08:31.800
 And so the idea is that through some series of operations like this on the data, I anonymize

1:08:31.800 --> 1:08:32.800
 it.

1:08:32.800 --> 1:08:38.880
 You know, another term of art that's used is removing personally identifiable information.

1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:45.600
 And you know, this is basically the most common way of providing data privacy, but that it's

1:08:45.600 --> 1:08:50.240
 in a way that still lets people access the, some variant form of the data.

1:08:50.240 --> 1:08:56.080
 So at a slightly broader picture, as you talk about what does anonymization mean when you

1:08:56.080 --> 1:09:01.440
 have multiple database, like with a Netflix prize, when you can start combining stuff

1:09:01.440 --> 1:09:02.440
 together.

1:09:02.440 --> 1:09:05.400
 So this is exactly the problem with these notions, right?

1:09:05.400 --> 1:09:10.900
 Is that notions of a anonymization, removing personally identifiable information, the kind

1:09:10.900 --> 1:09:16.000
 of fundamental conceptual flaw is that, you know, these definitions kind of pretend as

1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:21.240
 if the data set in question is the only data set that exists in the world or that ever

1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:23.640
 will exist in the future.

1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:28.080
 And of course, things like the Netflix prize and many, many other examples since the Netflix

1:09:28.080 --> 1:09:33.320
 prize, I think that was one of the earliest ones though, you know, you can reidentify

1:09:33.320 --> 1:09:38.540
 people that were, you know, that were anonymized in the data set by taking that anonymized

1:09:38.540 --> 1:09:43.240
 data set and combining it with other allegedly anonymized data sets and maybe publicly available

1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:44.480
 information about you.

1:09:44.480 --> 1:09:45.480
 You know,

1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:50.880
 for people who don't know the Netflix prize was, was being publicly released this data.

1:09:50.880 --> 1:09:55.640
 So the names from those rows were removed, but what was released is the preference or

1:09:55.640 --> 1:09:58.720
 the ratings of what movies you like and you don't like.

1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:03.360
 And from that combined with other things, I think forum posts and so on, you can start

1:10:03.360 --> 1:10:04.360
 to figure out

1:10:04.360 --> 1:10:10.400
 I guess it was specifically the internet movie database where, where lots of Netflix users

1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:15.280
 publicly rate their movie, you know, their movie preferences.

1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:21.840
 And so the anonymized data and Netflix, when it's just this phenomenon, I think that we've

1:10:21.840 --> 1:10:29.920
 all come to realize in the last decade or so is that just knowing a few apparently irrelevant

1:10:29.920 --> 1:10:33.100
 innocuous things about you can often act as a fingerprint.

1:10:33.100 --> 1:10:39.000
 Like if I know, you know, what, what rating you gave to these 10 movies and the date on

1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:43.480
 which you entered these movies, this is almost like a fingerprint for you in the sea of all

1:10:43.480 --> 1:10:44.480
 Netflix users.

1:10:44.480 --> 1:10:49.760
 There were just another paper on this in science or nature of about a month ago that, you know,

1:10:49.760 --> 1:10:51.240
 kind of 18 attributes.

1:10:51.240 --> 1:10:57.120
 I mean, my favorite example of this is, was actually a paper from several years ago now

1:10:57.120 --> 1:11:03.400
 where it was shown that just from your likes on Facebook, just from the time, you know,

1:11:03.400 --> 1:11:09.520
 the things on which you clicked on the thumbs up button on the platform, not using any information,

1:11:09.520 --> 1:11:14.720
 demographic information, nothing about who your friends are, just knowing the content

1:11:14.720 --> 1:11:20.680
 that you had liked was enough to, you know, in the aggregate accurately predict things

1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:27.280
 like sexual orientation, drug and alcohol use, whether you were the child of divorced parents.

1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:32.080
 So we live in this era where, you know, even the apparently irrelevant data that we offer

1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:38.760
 about ourselves on public platforms and forums often unbeknownst to us, more or less acts

1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:42.480
 as signature or, you know, fingerprint.

1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:46.980
 And that if you can kind of, you know, do a join between that kind of data and allegedly

1:11:46.980 --> 1:11:50.720
 anonymized data, you have real trouble.

1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:58.380
 So is there hope for any kind of privacy in a world where a few likes can identify you?

1:11:58.380 --> 1:12:00.380
 So there is differential privacy, right?

1:12:00.380 --> 1:12:01.380
 What is differential privacy?

1:12:01.380 --> 1:12:06.100
 Yeah, so differential privacy basically is a kind of alternate, much stronger notion

1:12:06.100 --> 1:12:10.280
 of privacy than these anonymization ideas.

1:12:10.280 --> 1:12:18.760
 And, you know, it's a technical definition, but like the spirit of it is we compare two

1:12:18.760 --> 1:12:20.320
 alternate worlds, okay?

1:12:20.320 --> 1:12:26.120
 So let's suppose I'm a researcher and I want to do, you know, there's a database of medical

1:12:26.120 --> 1:12:31.600
 records and one of them is yours, and I want to use that database of medical records to

1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:33.800
 build a predictive model for some disease.

1:12:33.800 --> 1:12:39.440
 So based on people's symptoms and test results and the like, I want to, you know, build a

1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:42.180
 probably model predicting the probability that people have disease.

1:12:42.180 --> 1:12:46.400
 So, you know, this is the type of scientific research that we would like to be allowed

1:12:46.400 --> 1:12:48.060
 to continue.

1:12:48.060 --> 1:12:53.400
 And in differential privacy, you ask a very particular counterfactual question.

1:12:53.400 --> 1:12:57.480
 We basically compare two alternatives.

1:12:57.480 --> 1:13:04.760
 One is when I do this, I build this model on the database of medical records, including

1:13:04.760 --> 1:13:07.200
 your medical record.

1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:15.320
 And the other one is where I do the same exercise with the same database with just your medical

1:13:15.320 --> 1:13:16.320
 record removed.

1:13:16.320 --> 1:13:22.280
 So basically, you know, it's two databases, one with N records in it and one with N minus

1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:23.840
 one records in it.

1:13:23.840 --> 1:13:27.960
 The N minus one records are the same, and the only one that's missing in the second

1:13:27.960 --> 1:13:30.420
 case is your medical record.

1:13:30.420 --> 1:13:40.580
 So differential privacy basically says that any harms that might come to you from the

1:13:40.580 --> 1:13:47.640
 analysis in which your data was included are essentially nearly identical to the harms

1:13:47.640 --> 1:13:52.720
 that would have come to you if the same analysis had been done without your medical record

1:13:52.720 --> 1:13:53.720
 included.

1:13:53.720 --> 1:13:58.280
 So in other words, this doesn't say that bad things cannot happen to you as a result of

1:13:58.280 --> 1:13:59.760
 data analysis.

1:13:59.760 --> 1:14:05.080
 It just says that these bad things were going to happen to you already, even if your data

1:14:05.080 --> 1:14:06.080
 wasn't included.

1:14:06.080 --> 1:14:12.360
 And to give a very concrete example, right, you know, like we discussed at some length,

1:14:12.360 --> 1:14:17.800
 the study that, you know, in the 50s that was done that established the link between

1:14:17.800 --> 1:14:19.960
 smoking and lung cancer.

1:14:19.960 --> 1:14:25.200
 And we make the point that, like, well, if your data was used in that analysis and, you

1:14:25.200 --> 1:14:28.980
 know, the world kind of knew that you were a smoker because, you know, there was no stigma

1:14:28.980 --> 1:14:35.160
 associated with smoking before those findings, real harm might have come to you as a result

1:14:35.160 --> 1:14:37.760
 of that study that your data was included in.

1:14:37.760 --> 1:14:42.440
 In particular, your insurer now might have a higher posterior belief that you might have

1:14:42.440 --> 1:14:44.360
 lung cancer and raise your premium.

1:14:44.360 --> 1:14:47.820
 So you've suffered economic damage.

1:14:47.820 --> 1:14:54.960
 But the point is, is that if the same analysis has been done with all the other N minus one

1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:58.800
 medical records and just yours missing, the outcome would have been the same.

1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:05.560
 Or your data wasn't idiosyncratically crucial to establishing the link between smoking and

1:15:05.560 --> 1:15:10.440
 lung cancer because the link between smoking and lung cancer is like a fact about the world

1:15:10.440 --> 1:15:14.820
 that can be discovered with any sufficiently large database of medical records.

1:15:14.820 --> 1:15:17.320
 But that's a very low value of harm.

1:15:17.320 --> 1:15:18.320
 Yeah.

1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:20.560
 So that's showing that very little harm is done.

1:15:20.560 --> 1:15:21.560
 Great.

1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:24.760
 But how what is the mechanism of differential privacy?

1:15:24.760 --> 1:15:27.600
 So that's the kind of beautiful statement of it.

1:15:27.600 --> 1:15:30.440
 It's the mechanism by which privacy is preserved.

1:15:30.440 --> 1:15:31.440
 Yeah.

1:15:31.440 --> 1:15:34.600
 So it's basically by adding noise to computations, right?

1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:40.400
 So the basic idea is that every differentially private algorithm, first of all, or every

1:15:40.400 --> 1:15:45.380
 good differentially private algorithm, every useful one, is a probabilistic algorithm.

1:15:45.380 --> 1:15:51.000
 So it doesn't, on a given input, if you gave the algorithm the same input multiple times,

1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:55.760
 it would give different outputs each time from some distribution.

1:15:55.760 --> 1:15:59.820
 And the way you achieve differential privacy algorithmically is by kind of carefully and

1:15:59.820 --> 1:16:05.400
 tastefully adding noise to a computation in the right places.

1:16:05.400 --> 1:16:11.600
 And to give a very concrete example, if I wanna compute the average of a set of numbers,

1:16:11.600 --> 1:16:17.220
 the non private way of doing that is to take those numbers and average them and release

1:16:17.220 --> 1:16:21.880
 like a numerically precise value for the average.

1:16:21.880 --> 1:16:24.200
 In differential privacy, you wouldn't do that.

1:16:24.200 --> 1:16:29.520
 You would first compute that average to numerical precisions, and then you'd add some noise

1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:30.520
 to it, right?

1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:37.520
 You'd add some kind of zero mean, Gaussian or exponential noise to it so that the actual

1:16:37.520 --> 1:16:44.120
 value you output is not the exact mean, but it'll be close to the mean, but it'll be close...

1:16:44.120 --> 1:16:50.560
 The noise that you add will sort of prove that nobody can kind of reverse engineer any

1:16:50.560 --> 1:16:53.440
 particular value that went into the average.

1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:56.200
 So noise is a savior.

1:16:56.200 --> 1:17:01.640
 How many algorithms can be aided by adding noise?

1:17:01.640 --> 1:17:07.040
 Yeah, so I'm a relatively recent member of the differential privacy community.

1:17:07.040 --> 1:17:12.440
 My co author, Aaron Roth is really one of the founders of the field and has done a great

1:17:12.440 --> 1:17:15.520
 deal of work and I've learned a tremendous amount working with him on it.

1:17:15.520 --> 1:17:17.240
 It's a pretty grown up field already.

1:17:17.240 --> 1:17:18.480
 Yeah, but now it's pretty mature.

1:17:18.480 --> 1:17:22.080
 But I must admit, the first time I saw the definition of differential privacy, my reaction

1:17:22.080 --> 1:17:28.360
 was like, wow, that is a clever definition and it's really making very strong promises.

1:17:28.360 --> 1:17:34.920
 And I first saw the definition in much earlier days and my first reaction was like, well,

1:17:34.920 --> 1:17:38.960
 my worry about this definition would be that it's a great definition of privacy, but that

1:17:38.960 --> 1:17:43.180
 it'll be so restrictive that we won't really be able to use it.

1:17:43.180 --> 1:17:47.200
 We won't be able to compute many things in a differentially private way.

1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:51.920
 So that's one of the great successes of the field, I think, is in showing that the opposite

1:17:51.920 --> 1:18:00.980
 is true and that most things that we know how to compute, absent any privacy considerations,

1:18:00.980 --> 1:18:02.920
 can be computed in a differentially private way.

1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:08.240
 So for example, pretty much all of statistics and machine learning can be done differentially

1:18:08.240 --> 1:18:09.320
 privately.

1:18:09.320 --> 1:18:15.120
 So pick your favorite machine learning algorithm, back propagation and neural networks, cart

1:18:15.120 --> 1:18:21.060
 for decision trees, support vector machines, boosting, you name it, as well as classic

1:18:21.060 --> 1:18:24.920
 hypothesis testing and the like in statistics.

1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:29.720
 None of those algorithms are differentially private in their original form.

1:18:29.720 --> 1:18:35.700
 All of them have modifications that add noise to the computation in different places in

1:18:35.700 --> 1:18:39.120
 different ways that achieve differential privacy.

1:18:39.120 --> 1:18:47.460
 So this really means that to the extent that we've become a scientific community very dependent

1:18:47.460 --> 1:18:53.400
 on the use of machine learning and statistical modeling and data analysis, we really do have

1:18:53.400 --> 1:19:02.760
 a path to provide privacy guarantees to those methods and so we can still enjoy the benefits

1:19:02.760 --> 1:19:10.760
 of the data science era while providing rather robust privacy guarantees to individuals.

1:19:10.760 --> 1:19:16.160
 So perhaps a slightly crazy question, but if we take the ideas of differential privacy

1:19:16.160 --> 1:19:20.680
 and take it to the nature of truth that's being explored currently.

1:19:20.680 --> 1:19:24.880
 So what's your most favorite and least favorite food?

1:19:24.880 --> 1:19:25.880
 Hmm.

1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:29.880
 I'm not a real foodie, so I'm a big fan of spaghetti.

1:19:29.880 --> 1:19:30.880
 Spaghetti?

1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:31.880
 Yeah.

1:19:31.880 --> 1:19:35.840
 What do you really don't like?

1:19:35.840 --> 1:19:37.280
 I really don't like cauliflower.

1:19:37.280 --> 1:19:39.280
 Wow, I love cauliflower.

1:19:39.280 --> 1:19:40.280
 Okay.

1:19:40.280 --> 1:19:46.400
 Is there one way to protect your preference for spaghetti by having an information campaign

1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:51.280
 bloggers and so on of bots saying that you like cauliflower?

1:19:51.280 --> 1:19:56.640
 So like this kind of the same kind of noise ideas, I mean if you think of in our politics

1:19:56.640 --> 1:20:01.920
 today there's this idea of Russia hacking our elections.

1:20:01.920 --> 1:20:07.200
 What's meant there I believe is bots spreading different kinds of information.

1:20:07.200 --> 1:20:10.480
 Is that a kind of privacy or is that too much of a stretch?

1:20:10.480 --> 1:20:12.160
 No it's not a stretch.

1:20:12.160 --> 1:20:19.320
 I've not seen those ideas, you know, that is not a technique that to my knowledge will

1:20:19.320 --> 1:20:24.400
 provide differential privacy, but to give an example like one very specific example

1:20:24.400 --> 1:20:30.240
 about what you're discussing is there was a very interesting project at NYU I think

1:20:30.240 --> 1:20:38.720
 led by Helen Nissenbaum there in which they basically built a browser plugin that tried

1:20:38.720 --> 1:20:41.640
 to essentially obfuscate your Google searches.

1:20:41.640 --> 1:20:46.440
 So to the extent that you're worried that Google is using your searches to build, you

1:20:46.440 --> 1:20:51.480
 know, predictive models about you to decide what ads to show you which they might very

1:20:51.480 --> 1:20:56.040
 reasonably want to do, but if you object to that they built this widget you could plug

1:20:56.040 --> 1:21:01.280
 in and basically whenever you put in a query into Google it would send that query to Google,

1:21:01.280 --> 1:21:06.200
 but in the background all of the time from your browser it would just be sending this

1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:11.800
 torrent of irrelevant queries to the search engine.

1:21:11.800 --> 1:21:16.840
 So you know it's like a weed and chaff thing so you know out of every thousand queries

1:21:16.840 --> 1:21:21.560
 let's say that Google was receiving from your browser one of them was one that you put in

1:21:21.560 --> 1:21:27.300
 but the other 999 were not okay so it's the same kind of idea kind of you know privacy

1:21:27.300 --> 1:21:29.680
 by obfuscation.

1:21:29.680 --> 1:21:34.920
 So I think that's an interesting idea, doesn't give you differential privacy.

1:21:34.920 --> 1:21:39.260
 It's also I was actually talking to somebody at one of the large tech companies recently

1:21:39.260 --> 1:21:45.560
 about the fact that you know just this kind of thing that there are some times when the

1:21:45.560 --> 1:21:53.120
 response to my data needs to be very specific to my data right like I type mountain biking

1:21:53.120 --> 1:21:58.420
 into Google, I want results on mountain biking and I really want Google to know that I typed

1:21:58.420 --> 1:22:01.880
 in mountain biking, I don't want noise added to that.

1:22:01.880 --> 1:22:06.180
 And so I think there's sort of maybe even interesting technical questions around notions

1:22:06.180 --> 1:22:10.800
 of privacy that are appropriate where you know it's not that my data is part of some

1:22:10.800 --> 1:22:15.800
 aggregate like medical records and that we're trying to discover important correlations

1:22:15.800 --> 1:22:20.960
 and facts about the world at large but rather you know there's a service that I really want

1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:26.120
 to you know pay attention to my specific data yet I still want some kind of privacy guarantee

1:22:26.120 --> 1:22:30.200
 and I think these kind of obfuscation ideas are sort of one way of getting at that but

1:22:30.200 --> 1:22:32.160
 maybe there are others as well.

1:22:32.160 --> 1:22:36.520
 So where do you think we'll land in this algorithm driven society in terms of privacy?

1:22:36.520 --> 1:22:44.960
 So sort of China like Kai Fuli describes you know it's collecting a lot of data on its

1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:52.360
 citizens but in the best form it's actually able to provide a lot of sort of protect human

1:22:52.360 --> 1:22:57.320
 rights and provide a lot of amazing services and it's worst forms that can violate those

1:22:57.320 --> 1:23:01.080
 human rights and limit services.

1:23:01.080 --> 1:23:08.400
 So where do you think we'll land because algorithms are powerful when they use data.

1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:12.900
 So as a society do you think we'll give over more data?

1:23:12.900 --> 1:23:16.400
 Is it possible to protect the privacy of that data?

1:23:16.400 --> 1:23:24.400
 So I'm optimistic about the possibility of you know balancing the desire for individual

1:23:24.400 --> 1:23:32.360
 privacy and individual control of privacy with kind of societally and commercially beneficial

1:23:32.360 --> 1:23:37.840
 uses of data not unrelated to differential privacy or suggestions that say like well

1:23:37.840 --> 1:23:40.560
 individuals should have control of their data.

1:23:40.560 --> 1:23:43.600
 They should be able to limit the uses of that data.

1:23:43.600 --> 1:23:48.200
 They should even you know there's you know fledgling discussions going on in research

1:23:48.200 --> 1:23:54.680
 circles about allowing people selective use of their data and being compensated for it.

1:23:54.680 --> 1:23:59.480
 And then you get to sort of very interesting economic questions like pricing right.

1:23:59.480 --> 1:24:05.360
 And one interesting idea is that maybe differential privacy would also you know be a conceptual

1:24:05.360 --> 1:24:09.120
 framework in which you could talk about the relative value of different people's data

1:24:09.120 --> 1:24:12.080
 like you know to demystify this a little bit.

1:24:12.080 --> 1:24:17.320
 If I'm trying to build a predictive model for some rare disease and I'm trying to use

1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:22.480
 machine learning to do it, it's easy to get negative examples because the disease is rare

1:24:22.480 --> 1:24:23.740
 right.

1:24:23.740 --> 1:24:30.880
 But I really want to have lots of people with the disease in my data set okay.

1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:35.380
 And so somehow those people's data with respect to this application is much more valuable

1:24:35.380 --> 1:24:37.840
 to me than just like the background population.

1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:43.160
 And so maybe they should be compensated more for it.

1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:48.800
 And so you know I think these are kind of very, very fledgling conceptual questions

1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:54.000
 that maybe we'll have kind of technical thought on them sometime in the coming years.

1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:56.760
 But I do think we'll you know to kind of get more directly answer your question.

1:24:56.760 --> 1:25:02.760
 I think I'm optimistic at this point from what I've seen that we will land at some you

1:25:02.760 --> 1:25:08.640
 know better compromise than we're at right now where again you know privacy guarantees

1:25:08.640 --> 1:25:15.400
 are few far between and weak and users have very, very little control.

1:25:15.400 --> 1:25:20.320
 And I'm optimistic that we'll land in something that you know provides better privacy overall

1:25:20.320 --> 1:25:22.820
 and more individual control of data and privacy.

1:25:22.820 --> 1:25:27.740
 But you know I think to get there it's again just like fairness it's not going to be enough

1:25:27.740 --> 1:25:29.560
 to propose algorithmic solutions.

1:25:29.560 --> 1:25:34.880
 There's going to have to be a whole kind of regulatory legal process that prods companies

1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:38.880
 and other parties to kind of adopt solutions.

1:25:38.880 --> 1:25:43.040
 And I think you've mentioned the word control a lot and I think giving people control that's

1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:48.200
 something that people don't quite have in a lot of these algorithms and that's a really

1:25:48.200 --> 1:25:50.540
 interesting idea of giving them control.

1:25:50.540 --> 1:25:57.920
 Some of that is actually literally an interface design question sort of just enabling because

1:25:57.920 --> 1:26:00.440
 I think it's good for everybody to give users control.

1:26:00.440 --> 1:26:06.160
 It's almost not a trade off except that you have to hire people that are good at interface

1:26:06.160 --> 1:26:07.160
 design.

1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:08.160
 Yeah.

1:26:08.160 --> 1:26:13.080
 I mean the other thing that has to be said right is that you know it's a cliche but you

1:26:13.080 --> 1:26:21.720
 know we as the users of many systems platforms and apps you know we are the product.

1:26:21.720 --> 1:26:23.120
 We are not the customer.

1:26:23.120 --> 1:26:26.760
 The customer are advertisers and our data is the product.

1:26:26.760 --> 1:26:27.760
 Okay.

1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:32.640
 So it's one thing to kind of suggest more individual control of data and privacy and

1:26:32.640 --> 1:26:40.480
 uses but this you know if this happens in sufficient degree it will upend the entire

1:26:40.480 --> 1:26:44.520
 economic model that has supported the internet to date.

1:26:44.520 --> 1:26:50.040
 And so some other economic model will have to be you know we'll have to replace it.

1:26:50.040 --> 1:26:56.480
 So the idea of markets you mentioned by exposing the economic model to the people they will

1:26:56.480 --> 1:26:57.920
 then become a market.

1:26:57.920 --> 1:27:00.280
 They could be participants in it.

1:27:00.280 --> 1:27:04.680
 And you know this isn't you know this is not a weird idea right because there are markets

1:27:04.680 --> 1:27:05.720
 for data already.

1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:10.080
 It's just that consumers are not participants and there's like you know there's sort of

1:27:10.080 --> 1:27:14.780
 you know publishers and content providers on one side that have inventory and then their

1:27:14.780 --> 1:27:19.680
 advertisers on the others and you know you know Google and Facebook are running you know

1:27:19.680 --> 1:27:25.540
 they're pretty much their entire revenue stream is by running two sided markets between those

1:27:25.540 --> 1:27:27.380
 parties right.

1:27:27.380 --> 1:27:32.800
 And so it's not a crazy idea that there would be like a three sided market or that you know

1:27:32.800 --> 1:27:37.080
 that on one side of the market or the other we would have proxies representing our interest.

1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:43.080
 It's not you know it's not a crazy idea but it would it's not a crazy technical idea but

1:27:43.080 --> 1:27:49.920
 it would have pretty extreme economic consequences.

1:27:49.920 --> 1:27:55.520
 Speaking of markets a lot of fascinating aspects of this world arise not from individual human

1:27:55.520 --> 1:27:59.880
 beings but from the interaction of human beings.

1:27:59.880 --> 1:28:02.080
 You've done a lot of work in game theory.

1:28:02.080 --> 1:28:07.360
 First can you say what is game theory and how does it help us model and study?

1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:11.080
 Yeah game theory of course let us give credit where it's due.

1:28:11.080 --> 1:28:16.300
 You know it comes from the economist first and foremost but as I've mentioned before

1:28:16.300 --> 1:28:22.000
 like you know computer scientists never hesitate to wander into other people's turf and so

1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:26.520
 there is now this 20 year old field called algorithmic game theory.

1:28:26.520 --> 1:28:33.240
 But you know game theory first and foremost is a mathematical framework for reasoning

1:28:33.240 --> 1:28:40.240
 about collective outcomes in systems of interacting individuals.

1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:46.040
 You know so you need at least two people to get started in game theory and many people

1:28:46.040 --> 1:28:50.560
 are probably familiar with Prisoner's Dilemma as kind of a classic example of game theory

1:28:50.560 --> 1:28:57.000
 and a classic example where everybody looking out for their own individual interests leads

1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:02.560
 to a collective outcome that's kind of worse for everybody than what might be possible

1:29:02.560 --> 1:29:05.200
 if they cooperated for example.

1:29:05.200 --> 1:29:09.780
 But cooperation is not an equilibrium in Prisoner's Dilemma.

1:29:09.780 --> 1:29:16.120
 And so my work in the field of algorithmic game theory more generally in these areas

1:29:16.120 --> 1:29:24.720
 kind of looks at settings in which the number of actors is potentially extraordinarily large

1:29:24.720 --> 1:29:31.160
 and their incentives might be quite complicated and kind of hard to model directly but you

1:29:31.160 --> 1:29:36.120
 still want kind of algorithmic ways of kind of predicting what will happen or influencing

1:29:36.120 --> 1:29:39.880
 what will happen in the design of platforms.

1:29:39.880 --> 1:29:47.160
 So what to you is the most beautiful idea that you've encountered in game theory?

1:29:47.160 --> 1:29:48.160
 There's a lot of them.

1:29:48.160 --> 1:29:50.760
 I'm a big fan of the field.

1:29:50.760 --> 1:29:56.400
 I mean you know I mean technical answers to that of course would include Nash's work just

1:29:56.400 --> 1:30:02.640
 establishing that you know there is a competitive equilibrium under very very general circumstances

1:30:02.640 --> 1:30:09.840
 which in many ways kind of put the field on a firm conceptual footing because if you don't

1:30:09.840 --> 1:30:14.280
 have equilibrium it's kind of hard to ever reason about what might happen since you know

1:30:14.280 --> 1:30:16.200
 there's just no stability.

1:30:16.200 --> 1:30:20.680
 So just the idea that stability can emerge when there's multiple.

1:30:20.680 --> 1:30:23.840
 Not that it will necessarily emerge just that it's possible right.

1:30:23.840 --> 1:30:28.580
 Like the existence of equilibrium doesn't mean that sort of natural iterative behavior

1:30:28.580 --> 1:30:30.640
 will necessarily lead to it.

1:30:30.640 --> 1:30:31.640
 In the real world.

1:30:31.640 --> 1:30:32.640
 Yeah.

1:30:32.640 --> 1:30:35.960
 Maybe answering a slightly less personally than you asked the question I think within

1:30:35.960 --> 1:30:43.760
 the field of algorithmic game theory perhaps the single most important kind of technical

1:30:43.760 --> 1:30:49.640
 contribution that's been made is the realization between close connections between machine

1:30:49.640 --> 1:30:53.840
 learning and game theory and in particular between game theory and the branch of machine

1:30:53.840 --> 1:31:00.600
 learning that's known as no regret learning and this sort of provides a very general framework

1:31:00.600 --> 1:31:07.460
 in which a bunch of players interacting in a game or a system each one kind of doing

1:31:07.460 --> 1:31:12.440
 something that's in their self interest will actually kind of reach an equilibrium and

1:31:12.440 --> 1:31:18.960
 actually reach an equilibrium in a you know a pretty you know a rather you know short

1:31:18.960 --> 1:31:21.400
 amount of steps.

1:31:21.400 --> 1:31:30.120
 So you kind of mentioned acting greedily can somehow end up pretty good for everybody.

1:31:30.120 --> 1:31:31.320
 Or pretty bad.

1:31:31.320 --> 1:31:32.320
 Or pretty bad.

1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:33.320
 Yeah.

1:31:33.320 --> 1:31:34.320
 It will end up stable.

1:31:34.320 --> 1:31:35.320
 Yeah.

1:31:35.320 --> 1:31:36.320
 Right.

1:31:36.320 --> 1:31:41.500
 And and you know stability or equilibrium by itself is neither is not necessarily either

1:31:41.500 --> 1:31:43.220
 a good thing or a bad thing.

1:31:43.220 --> 1:31:45.840
 So what's the connection between machine learning and the ideas.

1:31:45.840 --> 1:31:50.960
 Well I think we kind of talked about these ideas already in kind of a non technical way

1:31:50.960 --> 1:31:57.200
 which is maybe the more interesting way of understanding them first which is you know

1:31:57.200 --> 1:32:04.840
 we have many systems platforms and apps these days that work really hard to use our data

1:32:04.840 --> 1:32:12.120
 and the data of everybody else on the platform to selfishly optimize on behalf of each user.

1:32:12.120 --> 1:32:13.120
 OK.

1:32:13.120 --> 1:32:17.960
 So you know let me let me give I think the cleanest example which is just driving apps

1:32:17.960 --> 1:32:24.040
 navigation apps like you know Google Maps and Waze where you know miraculously compared

1:32:24.040 --> 1:32:28.680
 to when I was growing up at least you know the objective would be the same when you wanted

1:32:28.680 --> 1:32:33.440
 to drive from point A to point B spend the least time driving not necessarily minimize

1:32:33.440 --> 1:32:35.840
 the distance but minimize the time.

1:32:35.840 --> 1:32:36.840
 Right.

1:32:36.840 --> 1:32:41.080
 And when I was growing up like the only resources you had to do that were like maps in the car

1:32:41.080 --> 1:32:46.540
 which literally just told you what roads were available and then you might have like half

1:32:46.540 --> 1:32:51.680
 hourly traffic reports just about the major freeways but not about side roads.

1:32:51.680 --> 1:32:54.040
 So you were pretty much on your own.

1:32:54.040 --> 1:32:57.920
 And now we've got these apps you pull it out and you say I want to go from point A to point

1:32:57.920 --> 1:33:03.360
 B and in response kind of to what everybody else is doing if you like what all the other

1:33:03.360 --> 1:33:09.280
 players in this game are doing right now here's the you know the route that minimizes your

1:33:09.280 --> 1:33:10.280
 driving time.

1:33:10.280 --> 1:33:16.560
 So it is really kind of computing a selfish best response for each of us in response to

1:33:16.560 --> 1:33:20.240
 what all of the rest of us are doing at any given moment.

1:33:20.240 --> 1:33:26.280
 And so you know I think it's quite fair to think of these apps as driving or nudging

1:33:26.280 --> 1:33:32.560
 us all towards the competitive or Nash equilibrium of that game.

1:33:32.560 --> 1:33:36.320
 Now you might ask like well that sounds great why is that a bad thing.

1:33:36.320 --> 1:33:45.400
 Well you know it's known both in theory and with some limited studies from actual like

1:33:45.400 --> 1:33:52.660
 traffic data that all of us being in this competitive equilibrium might cause our collective

1:33:52.660 --> 1:33:59.760
 driving time to be higher maybe significantly higher than it would be under other solutions.

1:33:59.760 --> 1:34:04.320
 And then you have to talk about what those other solutions might be and what the algorithms

1:34:04.320 --> 1:34:07.760
 to implement them are which we do discuss in the kind of game theory chapter of the

1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:09.880
 book.

1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:17.040
 But similarly you know on social media platforms or on Amazon you know all these algorithms

1:34:17.040 --> 1:34:22.000
 that are essentially trying to optimize our behalf they're driving us in a colloquial

1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:26.920
 sense towards some kind of competitive equilibrium and you know one of the most important lessons

1:34:26.920 --> 1:34:30.360
 of game theory is that just because we're at equilibrium doesn't mean that there's not

1:34:30.360 --> 1:34:35.720
 a solution in which some or maybe even all of us might be better off.

1:34:35.720 --> 1:34:39.080
 And then the connection to machine learning of course is that in all these platforms I've

1:34:39.080 --> 1:34:44.320
 mentioned the optimization that they're doing on our behalf is driven by machine learning

1:34:44.320 --> 1:34:48.040
 you know like predicting where the traffic will be predicting what products I'm going

1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:52.220
 to like predicting what would make me happy in my newsfeed.

1:34:52.220 --> 1:34:56.720
 Now in terms of the stability and the promise of that I have to ask just out of curiosity

1:34:56.720 --> 1:35:02.600
 how stable are these mechanisms that you game theory is just the economist came up with

1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:08.040
 and we all know that economists don't live in the real world just kidding sort of what's

1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:15.720
 do you think when we look at the fact that we haven't blown ourselves up from the from

1:35:15.720 --> 1:35:21.000
 a game theoretic concept of mutually shared destruction what are the odds that we destroy

1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:28.400
 ourselves with nuclear weapons as one example of a stable game theoretic system?

1:35:28.400 --> 1:35:32.080
 Just to prime your viewers a little bit I mean I think you're referring to the fact

1:35:32.080 --> 1:35:38.400
 that game theory was taken quite seriously back in the 60s as a tool for reasoning about

1:35:38.400 --> 1:35:45.160
 kind of Soviet US nuclear armament disarmament detente things like that.

1:35:45.160 --> 1:35:52.320
 I'll be honest as huge of a fan as I am of game theory and its kind of rich history it

1:35:52.320 --> 1:35:57.700
 still surprises me that you know you had people at the RAND Corporation back in those days

1:35:57.700 --> 1:36:02.800
 kind of drawing up you know two by two tables and one the row player is you know the US

1:36:02.800 --> 1:36:08.240
 and the column player is Russia and that they were taking seriously you know I'm sure if

1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:12.840
 I was there maybe it wouldn't have seemed as naive as it does at the time you know.

1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:15.440
 Seems to have worked which is why it seems naive.

1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:16.440
 Well we're still here.

1:36:16.440 --> 1:36:17.960
 We're still here in that sense.

1:36:17.960 --> 1:36:22.600
 Yeah even though I kind of laugh at those efforts they were more sensible then than

1:36:22.600 --> 1:36:26.540
 they would be now right because there were sort of only two nuclear powers at the time

1:36:26.540 --> 1:36:32.480
 and you didn't have to worry about deterring new entrants and who was developing the capacity

1:36:32.480 --> 1:36:39.120
 and so we have many you know it's definitely a game with more players now and more potential

1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:40.120
 entrants.

1:36:40.120 --> 1:36:46.200
 I'm not in general somebody who advocates using kind of simple mathematical models when

1:36:46.200 --> 1:36:51.840
 the stakes are as high as things like that and the complexities are very political and

1:36:51.840 --> 1:36:55.760
 social but we are still here.

1:36:55.760 --> 1:37:00.600
 So you've worn many hats one of which the one that first caused me to become a big fan

1:37:00.600 --> 1:37:04.460
 of your work many years ago is algorithmic trading.

1:37:04.460 --> 1:37:08.520
 So I have to just ask a question about this because you have so much fascinating work

1:37:08.520 --> 1:37:15.820
 there in the 21st century what role do you think algorithms have in space of trading

1:37:15.820 --> 1:37:19.080
 investment in the financial sector?

1:37:19.080 --> 1:37:27.160
 Yeah it's a good question I mean in the time I've spent on Wall Street and in finance you

1:37:27.160 --> 1:37:31.320
 know I've seen a clear progression and I think it's a progression that kind of models the

1:37:31.320 --> 1:37:38.640
 use of algorithms and automation more generally in society which is you know the things that

1:37:38.640 --> 1:37:44.240
 kind of get taken over by the algos first are sort of the things that computers are

1:37:44.240 --> 1:37:50.320
 obviously better at than people right so you know so first of all there needed to be this

1:37:50.320 --> 1:37:56.200
 era of automation right where just you know financial exchanges became largely electronic

1:37:56.200 --> 1:38:01.720
 which then enabled the possibility of you know trading becoming more algorithmic because

1:38:01.720 --> 1:38:06.720
 once you know that exchanges are electronic an algorithm can submit an order through an

1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:11.800
 API just as well as a human can do at a monitor quickly can read all the data so yeah and

1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:18.800
 so you know I think the places where algorithmic trading have had the greatest inroads and

1:38:18.800 --> 1:38:24.560
 had the first inroads were in kind of execution problems kind of optimized execution problems

1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:30.440
 so what I mean by that is at a large brokerage firm for example one of the lines of business

1:38:30.440 --> 1:38:36.320
 might be on behalf of large institutional clients taking you know what we might consider

1:38:36.320 --> 1:38:40.280
 difficult trade so it's not like a mom and pop investor saying I want to buy a hundred

1:38:40.280 --> 1:38:45.940
 shares of Microsoft it's a large hedge fund saying you know I want to buy a very very

1:38:45.940 --> 1:38:52.760
 large stake in Apple and I want to do it over the span of a day and it's such a large volume

1:38:52.760 --> 1:38:57.260
 that if you're not clever about how you break that trade up not just over time but over

1:38:57.260 --> 1:39:02.560
 perhaps multiple different electronic exchanges that all let you trade Apple on their platform

1:39:02.560 --> 1:39:07.760
 you know you will you will move you'll push prices around in a way that hurts your your

1:39:07.760 --> 1:39:11.600
 execution so you know this is the kind of you know this is an optimization problem this

1:39:11.600 --> 1:39:19.800
 is a control problem right and so machines are better we we know how to design algorithms

1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:23.600
 you know that are better at that kind of thing than a person is going to be able to do because

1:39:23.600 --> 1:39:29.320
 we can take volumes of historical and real time data to kind of optimize the schedule

1:39:29.320 --> 1:39:35.080
 with which we trade and you know similarly high frequency trading you know which is closely

1:39:35.080 --> 1:39:41.480
 related but not the same as optimized execution where you're just trying to spot very very

1:39:41.480 --> 1:39:48.520
 temporary you know mispricings between exchanges or within an asset itself or just predict

1:39:48.520 --> 1:39:54.800
 directional movement of a stock because of the kind of very very low level granular buying

1:39:54.800 --> 1:40:00.440
 and selling data in the in the exchange machines are good at this kind of stuff it's kind of

1:40:00.440 --> 1:40:08.080
 like the mechanics of trading what about the can machines do long terms of prediction yeah

1:40:08.080 --> 1:40:13.280
 so I think we are in an era where you know clearly there have been some very successful

1:40:13.280 --> 1:40:19.760
 you know quant hedge funds that are you know in what we would traditionally call you know

1:40:19.760 --> 1:40:24.520
 still in this the stat arb regime like so you know what's that stat arb referring to

1:40:24.520 --> 1:40:28.920
 statistical arbitrage but but for the purposes of this conversation what it really means

1:40:28.920 --> 1:40:35.840
 is making directional predictions in asset price movement or returns your prediction

1:40:35.840 --> 1:40:42.100
 about that directional movement is good for you know you you have a view that it's valid

1:40:42.100 --> 1:40:48.440
 for some period of time between a few seconds and a few days and that's the amount of time

1:40:48.440 --> 1:40:51.920
 that you're going to kind of get into the position hold it and then hopefully be right

1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:57.360
 about the directional movement and you know buy low and sell high as the cliche goes.

1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:04.300
 So that is a you know kind of a sweet spot I think for quant trading and investing right

1:41:04.300 --> 1:41:11.920
 now and has been for some time when you really get to kind of more Warren Buffett style timescales

1:41:11.920 --> 1:41:16.800
 right like you know my cartoon of Warren Buffett is that you know Warren Buffett sits and thinks

1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:22.360
 what the long term value of Apple really should be and he doesn't even look at what Apple

1:41:22.360 --> 1:41:27.400
 is doing today he just decides you know you know I think that this is what its long term

1:41:27.400 --> 1:41:31.960
 value is and it's far from that right now and so I'm going to buy some Apple or you

1:41:31.960 --> 1:41:37.880
 know short some Apple and I'm going to I'm going to sit on that for 10 or 20 years okay.

1:41:37.880 --> 1:41:45.600
 So when you're at that kind of timescale or even more than just a few days all kinds of

1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:51.600
 other sources of risk and information you know so now you're talking about holding things

1:41:51.600 --> 1:41:56.080
 through recessions and economic cycles, wars can break out.

1:41:56.080 --> 1:41:59.080
 So there you have to understand human nature at a level that.

1:41:59.080 --> 1:42:03.820
 Yeah and you need to just be able to ingest many many more sources of data that are on

1:42:03.820 --> 1:42:06.380
 wildly different timescales right.

1:42:06.380 --> 1:42:13.120
 So if I'm an HFT I'm a high frequency trader like I don't I don't I really my main source

1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:18.000
 of data is just the data from the exchanges themselves about the activity in the exchanges

1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:22.880
 right and maybe I need to pay you know I need to keep an eye on the news right because you

1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:29.040
 know that can cause sudden you know the CEO gets caught in a scandal or you know gets

1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:33.720
 run over by a bus or something that can cause very sudden changes but you know I don't need

1:42:33.720 --> 1:42:38.480
 to understand economic cycles I don't need to understand recessions I don't need to worry

1:42:38.480 --> 1:42:43.600
 about the political situation or war breaking out in this part of the world because you

1:42:43.600 --> 1:42:49.720
 know all I need to know is as long as that's not going to happen in the next 500 milliseconds

1:42:49.720 --> 1:42:52.440
 then you know my model is good.

1:42:52.440 --> 1:42:55.760
 When you get to these longer timescales you really have to worry about that kind of stuff

1:42:55.760 --> 1:42:59.280
 and people in the machine learning community are starting to think about this.

1:42:59.280 --> 1:43:06.760
 We held a we jointly sponsored a workshop at Penn with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia

1:43:06.760 --> 1:43:10.960
 a little more than a year ago on you know I think the title is something like machine

1:43:10.960 --> 1:43:14.120
 learning for macroeconomic prediction.

1:43:14.120 --> 1:43:19.440
 You know macroeconomic referring specifically to these longer timescales and you know it

1:43:19.440 --> 1:43:26.800
 was an interesting conference but it you know my it left me with greater confidence that

1:43:26.800 --> 1:43:32.440
 we have a long way to go to you know and so I think that people that you know in the grand

1:43:32.440 --> 1:43:37.480
 scheme of things you know if somebody asked me like well whose job on Wall Street is safe

1:43:37.480 --> 1:43:42.840
 from the bots I think people that are at that longer you know timescale and have that appetite

1:43:42.840 --> 1:43:49.320
 for all the risks involved in long term investing and that really need kind of not just algorithms

1:43:49.320 --> 1:43:54.480
 that can optimize from data but they need views on stuff they need views on the political

1:43:54.480 --> 1:44:01.000
 landscape economic cycles and the like and I think you know they're they're they're pretty

1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:02.680
 safe for a while as far as I can tell.

1:44:02.680 --> 1:44:08.320
 So Warren Buffett's job is not seeing you know a robo Warren Buffett anytime soon.

1:44:08.320 --> 1:44:10.080
 Give him comfort.

1:44:10.080 --> 1:44:11.160
 Last question.

1:44:11.160 --> 1:44:18.320
 If you could go back to if there's a day in your life you could relive because it made

1:44:18.320 --> 1:44:21.280
 you truly happy.

1:44:21.280 --> 1:44:29.100
 Maybe you outside family what otherwise you know what what what day would it be.

1:44:29.100 --> 1:44:40.720
 But can you look back you remember just being profoundly transformed in some way or blissful.

1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:44.840
 I'll answer a slightly different question which is like what's a day in my my life or

1:44:44.840 --> 1:44:49.040
 my career that was kind of a watershed moment.

1:44:49.040 --> 1:44:55.760
 I went straight from undergrad to doctoral studies and you know that's not at all atypical

1:44:55.760 --> 1:45:00.440
 and I'm also from an academic family like my my dad was a professor my uncle on his

1:45:00.440 --> 1:45:03.440
 side as a professor both my grandfathers were professors.

1:45:03.440 --> 1:45:05.640
 All kinds of majors to philosophy.

1:45:05.640 --> 1:45:10.820
 Yeah they're kind of all over the map yeah and I was a grad student here just up the

1:45:10.820 --> 1:45:15.840
 river at Harvard and came to study with Les Valiant which was a wonderful experience.

1:45:15.840 --> 1:45:21.600
 But you know I remember my first year of graduate school I was generally pretty unhappy and

1:45:21.600 --> 1:45:25.720
 I was unhappy because you know at Berkeley as an undergraduate you know yeah I studied

1:45:25.720 --> 1:45:29.960
 a lot of math and computer science but it was a huge school first of all and I took

1:45:29.960 --> 1:45:34.020
 a lot of other courses as we've discussed I started as an English major and took history

1:45:34.020 --> 1:45:40.200
 courses and art history classes and had friends you know that did all kinds of different things.

1:45:40.200 --> 1:45:44.840
 And you know Harvard's a much smaller institution than Berkeley and its computer science department

1:45:44.840 --> 1:45:48.720
 especially at that time was was a much smaller place than it is now.

1:45:48.720 --> 1:45:54.000
 And I suddenly just felt very you know like I'd gone from this very big world to this

1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:59.400
 highly specialized world and now all of the classes I was taking were computer science

1:45:59.400 --> 1:46:04.600
 classes and I was only in classes with math and computer science people.

1:46:04.600 --> 1:46:09.960
 And so I was you know I thought often in that first year of grad school about whether I

1:46:09.960 --> 1:46:14.760
 really wanted to stick with it or not and you know I thought like oh I could you know

1:46:14.760 --> 1:46:19.860
 stop with a master's I could go back to the Bay Area and to California and you know this

1:46:19.860 --> 1:46:23.660
 was in one of the early periods where there was you know like you could definitely get

1:46:23.660 --> 1:46:28.680
 a relatively good job paying job at one of the one of the tech companies back you know

1:46:28.680 --> 1:46:31.440
 that were the big tech companies back then.

1:46:31.440 --> 1:46:36.880
 And so I distinctly remember like kind of a late spring day when I was kind of you know

1:46:36.880 --> 1:46:40.440
 sitting in Boston Common and kind of really just kind of chewing over what I wanted to

1:46:40.440 --> 1:46:45.220
 do with my life and I realized like okay and I think this is where my academic background

1:46:45.220 --> 1:46:46.220
 helped me a great deal.

1:46:46.220 --> 1:46:50.420
 I sort of realized you know yeah you're not having a great time right now this feels really

1:46:50.420 --> 1:46:56.320
 narrowing but you know that you're here for research eventually and to do something original

1:46:56.320 --> 1:47:02.320
 and to try to you know carve out a career where you kind of you know choose what you

1:47:02.320 --> 1:47:06.260
 want to think about you know and have a great deal of independence.

1:47:06.260 --> 1:47:10.920
 And so you know at that point I really didn't have any real research experience yet I mean

1:47:10.920 --> 1:47:15.840
 it was trying to think about some problems with very little success but I knew that like

1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:23.320
 I hadn't really tried to do the thing that I knew I'd come to do and so I thought you

1:47:23.320 --> 1:47:30.080
 know I'm going to stick through it for the summer and you know and that was very formative

1:47:30.080 --> 1:47:37.160
 because I went from kind of contemplating quitting to you know a year later it being

1:47:37.160 --> 1:47:42.360
 very clear to me I was going to finish because I still had a ways to go but I kind of started

1:47:42.360 --> 1:47:46.520
 doing research it was going well it was really interesting and it was sort of a complete

1:47:46.520 --> 1:47:52.400
 transformation you know it's just that transition that I think every doctoral student makes

1:47:52.400 --> 1:48:00.040
 at some point which is to sort of go from being like a student of what's been done before

1:48:00.040 --> 1:48:04.120
 to doing you know your own thing and figure out what makes you interested in what your

1:48:04.120 --> 1:48:09.280
 strengths and weaknesses are as a researcher and once you know I kind of made that decision

1:48:09.280 --> 1:48:15.120
 on that particular day at that particular moment in Boston Common you know I'm glad

1:48:15.120 --> 1:48:16.240
 I made that decision.

1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:19.400
 And also just accepting the painful nature of that journey.

1:48:19.400 --> 1:48:21.400
 Yeah exactly exactly.

1:48:21.400 --> 1:48:26.880
 In that moment said I'm gonna I'm gonna stick it out yeah I'm gonna stick around for a while.

1:48:26.880 --> 1:48:30.880
 Well Michael I've looked off do you work for a long time it's really nice to talk to you

1:48:30.880 --> 1:48:31.880
 thank you so much.

1:48:31.880 --> 1:48:34.360
 It's great to get back in touch with you too and see how great you're doing as well.

1:48:34.360 --> 1:48:35.360
 Thanks a lot.

1:48:35.360 --> 1:48:57.320
 Thank you.
