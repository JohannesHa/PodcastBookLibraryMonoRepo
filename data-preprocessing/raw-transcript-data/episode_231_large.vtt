00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
 The following is a conversation with Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer at the Human

00:05.040 --> 00:08.520
 Rights Foundation and the Oslo Freedom Forum.

00:08.520 --> 00:13.960
 In recent times, Alex has focused on how cryptocurrency, and especially Bitcoin, can be a tool for

00:13.960 --> 00:20.020
 empowering democracy and civil liberties in the world, most crucially, parts of the world

00:20.020 --> 00:23.680
 that are living under authoritarian regimes.

00:23.680 --> 00:28.520
 As a side note, let me say that I have been learning a lot about the ways in which money

00:28.520 --> 00:33.580
 can be used to amass power, and in the same way, the decentralization of money can be

00:33.580 --> 00:36.960
 used to resist the corrupting nature of this power.

00:36.960 --> 00:42.840
 Alex and I do not agree on everything, but we strive for the same betterment of humanity.

00:42.840 --> 00:48.120
 He is sensitive to the suffering in the world, and is dedicating his life to finding solutions

00:48.120 --> 00:50.080
 that lessen that suffering.

00:50.080 --> 00:55.500
 Whether Bitcoin is one such solution, I don't know, but I think it has a chance, and that

00:55.500 --> 00:58.560
 means it is worth exploring deeply.

00:58.560 --> 01:03.960
 I'm staying in this path of learning, patiently, and with as little ego as possible, I hope

01:03.960 --> 01:07.360
 you come along with me on this journey as well.

01:07.360 --> 01:13.060
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, to support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:13.060 --> 01:18.800
 We recorded this conversation a while ago, and I thought I lost the audio, and was really

01:18.800 --> 01:24.640
 disappointed with myself for messing this thing up, but luckily, last week, I found

01:24.640 --> 01:31.920
 it, and so, rescued from out of the abyss of nonexistence, here's my conversation with

01:31.920 --> 01:34.840
 Alex Glastain.

01:34.840 --> 01:40.040
 What are some universal human rights that you believe all people should have?

01:40.040 --> 01:45.760
 So free speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of belief, freedom to participate in your

01:45.760 --> 01:51.240
 government, the freedom to have privacy, the freedom to own things, property rights, these

01:51.240 --> 01:55.840
 are all basic, fundamental, negative rights, what we call them.

01:55.840 --> 01:59.240
 These are the basic, fundamental human freedoms.

01:59.240 --> 02:02.640
 What does negative rights mean?

02:02.640 --> 02:07.360
 Negative rights are liberties, and positive rights are entitlements.

02:07.360 --> 02:12.680
 So after World War II, when the UN came together, it was largely a compromise between the communist

02:12.680 --> 02:16.160
 Soviet Union and the, you know, free United States, right?

02:16.160 --> 02:23.600
 So the US had, on its side of the UN Declaration of Human Rights, a bunch of liberties, essentially,

02:23.600 --> 02:27.340
 things like free speech, freedom of association, freedom of assembly.

02:27.340 --> 02:31.920
 The Soviets wanted entitlements, like the right to work, the right to have housing,

02:31.920 --> 02:34.240
 the right to water, the right to a vacation.

02:34.240 --> 02:38.480
 So if you actually read the UN Declaration for Human Rights, it's a negotiation between

02:38.480 --> 02:40.480
 the Soviets and the Americans.

02:40.480 --> 02:44.920
 Later, there was another document in the 70s released called the International Covenant

02:44.920 --> 02:46.960
 on Civil and Political Rights.

02:46.960 --> 02:52.080
 And this is what HRF uses as its sort of like lodestar, its founding document.

02:52.080 --> 02:56.420
 And this is like, essentially, an international agreement on the negative rights.

02:56.420 --> 03:00.320
 Those are the things we choose to focus on, because essentially, authoritarian regimes

03:00.320 --> 03:06.100
 can commit fraud and claim they're giving the positive rights, the entitlements, without

03:06.100 --> 03:08.360
 having any of the negative liberties.

03:08.360 --> 03:12.880
 And they can do that because they don't have any like free speech or press freedom.

03:12.880 --> 03:17.120
 When you take people's basic fundamental freedoms away, it's quite easy to make like a Potemkin

03:17.120 --> 03:22.920
 village and pretend that there's the entitlements and that we have good health care and, you

03:22.920 --> 03:28.480
 know, it's the same sort of thing that authoritarians have done for decades, Cuba and Venezuela

03:28.480 --> 03:29.480
 and the Soviet Union.

03:29.480 --> 03:30.480
 Peter Bell.

03:30.480 --> 03:34.920
 Do you think it's possible for authoritarian regimes to manipulate, to kind of lie about

03:34.920 --> 03:40.200
 the negative rights as well, by saying that the people have free speech, the people have

03:40.200 --> 03:45.720
 the freedom for assembly and all those kinds of things, can't you still manipulate the

03:45.720 --> 03:49.240
 idea that citizenry still has those rights?

03:49.240 --> 03:56.320
 The opposition leader of Malaysia, Anwar Ibrahim, he once told me the funny joke that, you know,

03:56.320 --> 04:00.560
 in my country, we have freedom of speech, we don't have freedom after speech.

04:00.560 --> 04:04.280
 So yeah, they can absolutely manipulate whatever they want.

04:04.280 --> 04:07.560
 But I've done research into socioeconomic data.

04:07.560 --> 04:12.920
 And I guess what I'm telling you is that authoritarian regimes, which make up 53% of the world's

04:12.920 --> 04:19.440
 population across 95 countries, about 4.3 billion people, those who live under those

04:19.440 --> 04:26.720
 regimes are subject to massive fraud when it comes to things like literacy rates, life

04:26.720 --> 04:31.840
 expectancy, any sort of socioeconomic data, economic growth.

04:31.840 --> 04:34.760
 They can do this because there's no free press.

04:34.760 --> 04:39.400
 So for us at the Human Rights Foundation, and for people like me, we believe that the

04:39.400 --> 04:43.760
 negative rights, the liberties, the things that are in, for example, the Bill of Rights

04:43.760 --> 04:48.020
 in the US Constitution, these things are the table and then we can build on top of that.

04:48.020 --> 04:50.560
 We can build the rest of our societies on top of that.

04:50.560 --> 04:54.960
 The freest countries in the world have both the negative liberties and the entitlements

04:54.960 --> 04:59.760
 like Norway, for example, but there's a big difference between Norway and North Korea.

04:59.760 --> 05:03.400
 In North Korea, they only claim to have the entitlements and they definitely don't have

05:03.400 --> 05:05.040
 the liberties.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.600
 Do you think there's one right that's more important than others?

05:07.600 --> 05:13.040
 You kind of suggested the freedom of the press, maybe freedom of speech, that if you take

05:13.040 --> 05:17.360
 that away, all the other ones kind of collapse along with like from a ripple effect.

05:17.360 --> 05:23.680
 Is there something fundamental that you like to focus your attention on to defend, to protect,

05:23.680 --> 05:24.960
 to make sure it's there?

05:24.960 --> 05:27.680
 Yeah, I think free speech is probably the most fundamental.

05:27.680 --> 05:32.400
 It's probably why the founders chose to make it into the First Amendment.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.880
 A lot of things are downstream from there.

05:34.880 --> 05:38.120
 Property rights are also very, very important.

05:38.120 --> 05:44.200
 Obviously we've seen the toll of violent redistributionism, you know, in over the last hundred years,

05:44.200 --> 05:52.840
 whether it was Lenin or Stalin or Mao or other regimes and everywhere from Ethiopia to colonialists

05:52.840 --> 05:56.840
 everywhere to North Korea, it's not a pretty legacy.

05:56.840 --> 06:00.620
 Is free speech clear to you as a concept?

06:00.620 --> 06:05.040
 There's been quite a few debates, especially in the digital age, what it means to violate

06:05.040 --> 06:06.480
 freedom of speech.

06:06.480 --> 06:12.000
 There's been a lot of new, like novel mechanisms for people to communicate with each other,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.400
 like especially on social networks.

06:14.400 --> 06:20.760
 And it seems that unclear because a lot of times those are managed by private companies.

06:20.760 --> 06:26.680
 It's unclear how much protection do the citizens have to have when they're communicating.

06:26.680 --> 06:30.320
 A lot of people are being censored on these social platforms.

06:30.320 --> 06:35.520
 Some people, even presidents get removed from those social platforms.

06:35.520 --> 06:42.680
 Have you thought about the freedom of speech in the United States, but in the world?

06:42.680 --> 06:50.520
 As it's implemented in the 21st century, given the internet and all those kinds of things?

06:50.520 --> 07:02.080
 There is a Soviet dissident named Natan Sharansky who survived the regime and he wrote a book

07:02.080 --> 07:06.320
 in which his thesis was essentially the way that you can define a free society is through

07:06.320 --> 07:08.720
 something called the town square test.

07:08.720 --> 07:14.360
 Can you go to a public space where you live and criticize your ruler loudly without fear

07:14.360 --> 07:16.020
 of retribution?

07:16.020 --> 07:18.240
 If you can do that, you have free speech.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.600
 I think that's a pretty good litmus test.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.940
 Most people in this world cannot do that.

07:21.940 --> 07:27.540
 If you live in Havana, if you live in Moscow, if you live in Beijing, you cannot do that.

07:27.540 --> 07:29.720
 And that's not a free society.

07:29.720 --> 07:36.920
 In Austin, Texas, in Boston, Massachusetts, in London, in Santiago, Chile, in Tokyo, Japan,

07:36.920 --> 07:38.960
 in many democracies, you can do that.

07:38.960 --> 07:42.760
 And I think that that's a really helpful basic sort of litmus test.

07:42.760 --> 07:46.080
 Does the content of the criticism matter?

07:46.080 --> 07:54.240
 Can it be complete lies, meaning conspiracy theories that involve claiming that the leader

07:54.240 --> 08:03.880
 is, let's say, a lizard slash pedophile slash, you know, I'm not saying that those are lies,

08:03.880 --> 08:08.740
 look into it, but they're very unlikely phenomena.

08:08.740 --> 08:10.680
 So like, does that matter?

08:10.680 --> 08:15.920
 I think it ends poorly when the state tries to restrict speech.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.480
 I think that's kind of how I would define censorship.

08:18.480 --> 08:22.800
 I think censorship and deplatforming are two different things.

08:22.800 --> 08:28.120
 Private companies, you know, they get to make up their own rules about what's allowed on

08:28.120 --> 08:29.120
 their platforms.

08:29.120 --> 08:34.400
 And I think that's very different from a government with guns and an army restricting the speech

08:34.400 --> 08:37.120
 of its citizens with threats of violence.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.160
 These things are different for me.

08:39.160 --> 08:42.480
 That violence is a fundamental difference.

08:42.480 --> 08:49.240
 I don't know, I've gotten the chance to have dinner with Alex Jones and I've talked to

08:49.240 --> 08:56.040
 him a few times offline and it does, I understand why people are so off put by him, but it does

08:56.040 --> 09:00.240
 bother me that he's universally removed from every platform.

09:00.240 --> 09:09.560
 It feels like there's many more evil people, bad people compared to Alex Jones who still

09:09.560 --> 09:12.760
 are given a voice on these platforms.

09:12.760 --> 09:21.240
 And so I'm uncomfortable with the universality of the application of the censorship by these

09:21.240 --> 09:22.240
 platforms.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.960
 But on the flip side, you're right.

09:23.960 --> 09:29.000
 There's not a violence, there's not tanks, there's not guns behind that censorship.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
 Yeah.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.720
 It's a bit of a generalization, but Alex Jones would be in prison or dead if he were in North

09:35.720 --> 09:40.720
 Korea or in Cuba or in Russia or in China, that the authorities would not tolerate him

09:40.720 --> 09:42.640
 to do what he did.

09:42.640 --> 09:45.280
 And here he can kind of do what he wants.

09:45.280 --> 09:52.200
 He's encountering some resistance in the marketplace of ideas, large organizations, corporations,

09:52.200 --> 09:58.680
 and a lot of public sentiment in different parts of our country don't like him.

09:58.680 --> 10:03.360
 They're doing their best to drown out his voice, but that's very different from a violent

10:03.360 --> 10:05.400
 threat of censorship from the state.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.600
 And that's what we study.

10:06.600 --> 10:09.680
 That's what I study are these, you know, what is the state doing?

10:09.680 --> 10:11.200
 That's kind of paramount for me.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.200
 Yeah.

10:12.200 --> 10:15.480
 And that's true because in the marketplace of ideas, there could be a company that springs

10:15.480 --> 10:21.000
 up that gives Alex Jones a platform and the United States is not going to prevent those

10:21.000 --> 10:22.760
 companies from functioning.

10:22.760 --> 10:32.000
 Of course, there's from a technology perspective, there is AWS removing Parler from the platform

10:32.000 --> 10:37.400
 and gets a little weird, you know, as you get closer and closer to the computer infrastructure,

10:37.400 --> 10:42.400
 because then you get closer and closer to the state, actually, the more you get to the

10:42.400 --> 10:47.360
 infrastructure that's usually managed by the state, the closer it gets to then the control

10:47.360 --> 10:48.360
 of the state.

10:48.360 --> 10:53.000
 I would argue AWS is pretty damn close to infrastructure that's kind of controlled

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
 by the state.

10:54.000 --> 11:01.800
 If you especially look at other nations, China, Russia, there's, I don't know who runs the

11:01.800 --> 11:06.080
 computer infrastructure for Russia and China, but I bet the state has complete oversight

11:06.080 --> 11:07.080
 over that.

11:07.080 --> 11:14.340
 And so that level of computer infrastructure, having control about which social networks

11:14.340 --> 11:17.480
 can and cannot operate is very uncomfortable to me.

11:17.480 --> 11:22.780
 But you're right, I think it's good to focus on the obvious violations of these principles

11:22.780 --> 11:25.360
 as opposed to the gray areas.

11:25.360 --> 11:28.440
 Of course, the gray areas are fascinating.

11:28.440 --> 11:31.720
 You mentioned HRF, Human Rights Foundation.

11:31.720 --> 11:32.960
 What is it?

11:32.960 --> 11:33.960
 What is its mission?

11:33.960 --> 11:39.800
 Yes, I've been working for HRF since 2007.

11:39.800 --> 11:46.480
 We are a charity, a nonprofit, a 501c3 based in New York, and our mission is to promote

11:46.480 --> 11:52.560
 and protect individual rights and freedoms in authoritarian societies around the world.

11:52.560 --> 11:57.320
 So again, we define about 95 countries as authoritarian, meaning it's either a one party

11:57.320 --> 12:03.080
 state or opposition politicians are outlawed or persecuted, there's no real free speech,

12:03.080 --> 12:06.560
 there's no press freedom, there's no independent judiciary, there really aren't checks and

12:06.560 --> 12:11.280
 balances and even trying to create like a human rights organization or like an environmental

12:11.280 --> 12:14.160
 group would be illegal.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.560
 And the majority of the world's population lives in that environment.

12:16.560 --> 12:17.560
 That's very important.

12:17.560 --> 12:18.560
 You said 53%.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.720
 53%, 4.3 billion people.

12:20.720 --> 12:27.700
 And I saw you outlined a lot of different sources of suffering in the world.

12:27.700 --> 12:33.440
 And then you sort of put people living under authoritarian governments as like more than

12:33.440 --> 12:35.960
 all of them.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.320
 I forget all the examples you provided, but then...

12:38.320 --> 12:39.320
 Sure.

12:39.320 --> 12:40.320
 I mean, it's...

12:40.320 --> 12:41.920
 Yeah, maybe you can mention if you remember.

12:41.920 --> 12:45.520
 The number of people who are refugees, the number of people who suffer from natural disasters,

12:45.520 --> 12:49.200
 the number of people who live under abject poverty, the number of people who don't have

12:49.200 --> 12:52.880
 access to clean drinking water, all of these are dwarfed by the number of people who live

12:52.880 --> 12:54.960
 under authoritarianism.

12:54.960 --> 12:59.680
 And yet it's not something that we talk about a lot because people are mercantilist and

12:59.680 --> 13:04.920
 the powers that be are happy to sacrifice freedoms and privacy for money.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.520
 We live in a profit seeking world.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.880
 To get evidence of this, take a look at the list of sponsors of the upcoming Olympics

13:11.880 --> 13:17.120
 in China where the CCP is currently committing genocide against the weaker population or

13:17.120 --> 13:21.540
 look at the number of people and the famous investors who went to Saudi Arabia a couple

13:21.540 --> 13:23.480
 months ago for the Davos in the desert.

13:23.480 --> 13:27.880
 I mean, Ray Dalio was there, all kinds of people were there, or at least they were invited

13:27.880 --> 13:29.960
 and they said they were gonna go.

13:29.960 --> 13:35.780
 And this is a government that at the time was torturing a female activist who just wanted

13:35.780 --> 13:36.780
 to drive a car.

13:36.780 --> 13:42.620
 This is a government that had murdered Jamal Khashoggi in a brutal fashion just a couple

13:42.620 --> 13:43.620
 years earlier.

13:43.620 --> 13:49.640
 So, I mean, at the end of the day when it comes down to brass tacks, I mean, the powers

13:49.640 --> 13:56.840
 that be, even the free countries are led by people who are very, very happy to sacrifice

13:56.840 --> 14:00.520
 all these pretty words about human rights when it comes down to profits, unfortunately.

14:00.520 --> 14:05.440
 So, do you think capitalism, that's maybe one of the flaws of capitalism is it turns

14:05.440 --> 14:12.540
 a blind eye to injustices against human nature, against the human rights, like it turns a

14:12.540 --> 14:14.480
 blind eye to authoritarian governments?

14:14.480 --> 14:22.800
 Look, I think that at the end of the day, like free trade is actually really good.

14:22.800 --> 14:27.320
 And you can just look at France and Germany as an example of how like a capitalist structure

14:27.320 --> 14:28.320
 would develop.

14:28.320 --> 14:31.400
 If you have two capitalist actors, they're very unlikely to fight each other.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.480
 There's very unlikely to be violence, right?

14:33.480 --> 14:38.600
 These are two countries which basically murdered some large percentage of each other's male

14:38.600 --> 14:42.200
 population three times in a hundred years in three different wars, right?

14:42.200 --> 14:47.760
 And now today, war is like unthinkable and a lot of that is because of increased collaboration,

14:47.760 --> 14:48.760
 increased trade.

14:48.760 --> 14:54.680
 So, when you have two capitalist actors, they act in a very productive way with each other.

14:54.680 --> 14:59.360
 But as soon as you introduce an authoritarian actor, all bets are off.

14:59.360 --> 15:05.880
 So, I think what you have is a conflict between capitalist actors and authoritarian actors.

15:05.880 --> 15:13.480
 And at the end of the day, people need to, yes, have more than just capitalist intentions

15:13.480 --> 15:18.800
 in the geopolitical level I'm talking about, they need to actually take a stand for principles.

15:18.800 --> 15:25.400
 Otherwise, you have athletes and businesses and governments that are all too happy to

15:25.400 --> 15:28.360
 do business with the Chinese Communist Party, for example, right now.

15:28.360 --> 15:34.240
 I think that there is a little more than just kind of the pure profit, yes.

15:34.240 --> 15:41.880
 You mentioned what are the signs that the state is an authoritarian state.

15:41.880 --> 15:46.120
 How do you know if you're living in an authoritarian state or when you study another nation and

15:46.120 --> 15:51.840
 analyze the behavior of another nation, how do you know that's an authoritarian state?

15:51.840 --> 15:54.640
 Is it as simple as them having a dictator?

15:54.640 --> 15:58.260
 Is it as simple as them as declaring that they don't have a democracy or is there something

15:58.260 --> 15:59.260
 more subtle?

15:59.260 --> 16:01.400
 There's a couple of good litmus tests.

16:01.400 --> 16:04.480
 One is actually, can you have a gay pride parade?

16:04.480 --> 16:10.040
 It actually lines up perfectly, it doesn't matter what religion the dictatorship is.

16:10.040 --> 16:14.520
 They don't like minorities and they love to scapegoat, whether it's gays or religious

16:14.520 --> 16:16.020
 minorities, etc.

16:16.020 --> 16:17.280
 So it lines up pretty well.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.280
 That's really interesting.

16:18.280 --> 16:22.140
 If you cannot have a gay pride parade in your country, because you're fearful that you're

16:22.140 --> 16:27.280
 going to get the crap kicked out of you, probably live in an authoritarian regime.

16:27.280 --> 16:31.520
 I'm sure that's not just about some kind of homophobia.

16:31.520 --> 16:32.520
 Why is that?

16:32.520 --> 16:33.520
 That's really interesting.

16:33.520 --> 16:34.520
 Because that's right.

16:34.520 --> 16:35.520
 I'm going through...

16:35.520 --> 16:37.400
 Fascism scapegoats minorities.

16:37.400 --> 16:40.760
 There's an other, you create an other group and then you...

16:40.760 --> 16:46.760
 Yeah, I mean Uganda is a great example of this, but so is Saudi Arabia, so is China.

16:46.760 --> 16:48.240
 I mean, so is Cuba.

16:48.240 --> 16:53.760
 I mean, these are all regimes which demonize the LGBT communities.

16:53.760 --> 17:00.240
 It's interesting because maybe you can correct me, but from my very distant outside of perspective,

17:00.240 --> 17:10.400
 the sort of the way that certain authoritarian governments speak about gay people is it's

17:10.400 --> 17:13.840
 almost like, what is it?

17:13.840 --> 17:19.200
 We don't have gay people in our country kind of idea as opposed to scapegoating, which

17:19.200 --> 17:21.120
 is like...

17:21.120 --> 17:23.760
 Total denial is the most powerful form of demonization.

17:23.760 --> 17:26.960
 I mean, this is what the Iranian dictatorship does.

17:26.960 --> 17:31.660
 A few years ago when Ahmadinejad, who was then sort of the de facto leader, he came

17:31.660 --> 17:35.440
 to Columbia University and he tried to give a speech, which you can look up and he tried

17:35.440 --> 17:37.800
 to claim that there were no gays in Iran.

17:37.800 --> 17:42.280
 And that's the most powerful form of demonization is trying to just wipe out your utter existence.

17:42.280 --> 17:46.120
 There's other good litmus tests too.

17:46.120 --> 17:49.520
 For example, you can think about comedy.

17:49.520 --> 17:53.280
 Can you make money making fun of your government on television?

17:53.280 --> 17:55.440
 If you cannot, you live in a dictatorship most likely.

17:55.440 --> 18:00.000
 I mean, it's shocking to people that I work with who live in dictatorships when I tell

18:00.000 --> 18:05.760
 them that not only are comedians able to safely make fun of our government, but they get paid

18:05.760 --> 18:07.360
 very well to do so.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.280
 That's a hallmark of our free society.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.800
 That's another good litmus test.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.560
 Hear that Tim Dylan, you should go to North Korea, check it out.

18:14.560 --> 18:15.560
 Yeah.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.040
 And look, there are tons of flaws with democracies.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.000
 This is a really good test by the way.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.280
 The United States is a deeply flawed country in many ways.

18:21.280 --> 18:24.120
 Our prison system is a disaster.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.960
 There's a horrible war on drugs.

18:26.960 --> 18:31.960
 We committed a grievous crime in my opinion by invading Iraq.

18:31.960 --> 18:38.640
 We did a lot of problematic things, but our core architecture is still an open society.

18:38.640 --> 18:44.440
 The people who criticize the US the most usually live within it.

18:44.440 --> 18:49.080
 And if they were to move to a different country and try to use that criticism against their

18:49.080 --> 18:51.640
 new rulers, they wouldn't fare so well.

18:51.640 --> 18:57.080
 So whether it's Chomsky or whomever, if they were to go to Cuba and live in Cuba and try

18:57.080 --> 19:01.240
 to criticize Cuba like they do America, it wouldn't last very long.

19:01.240 --> 19:06.160
 So I think what's important to distinguish between open societies and closed ones or

19:06.160 --> 19:10.880
 like free societies and authoritarian regimes, it doesn't mean that your government's going

19:10.880 --> 19:12.760
 to be good all the time.

19:12.760 --> 19:17.440
 What it means is that the citizens have a way to push for reform, have a way to hold

19:17.440 --> 19:18.440
 the rulers accountable.

19:18.440 --> 19:23.160
 So even if you don't like what the US government does, whether it was under Biden or Trump

19:23.160 --> 19:27.080
 or Obama or Bush, we can rotate them through voting.

19:27.080 --> 19:30.900
 And we have an independent Supreme Court that rotates over time.

19:30.900 --> 19:34.840
 And we have people that we can elect directly to serve our interests.

19:34.840 --> 19:39.280
 And then there's like a free press and there's lobbyists and all kinds of people that jostle

19:39.280 --> 19:40.280
 for power.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.320
 So there's a separation of powers.

19:42.320 --> 19:48.120
 And I like to think about a free society really as like at the bottom of the foundation of

19:48.120 --> 19:50.680
 the pyramid really would be free speech.

19:50.680 --> 19:55.680
 And then you would have civil society, like for example, human rights organizations, environmental

19:55.680 --> 19:59.840
 groups, stamp collectors, athletes, any groups that come together beyond the government's

19:59.840 --> 20:00.840
 sort of strict instruction.

20:00.840 --> 20:05.320
 And then on top of that, at the third level, you have separation of powers, again, what

20:05.320 --> 20:06.840
 I'm describing.

20:06.840 --> 20:10.360
 So authoritarian regimes don't really have any of these layers to them.

20:10.360 --> 20:14.480
 And then at the top, then you put elections, but the elections are meaningless if you don't

20:14.480 --> 20:16.120
 have the foundation below.

20:16.120 --> 20:17.640
 Every dictator gets elected.

20:17.640 --> 20:19.280
 Kim Jong Un gets elected.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.400
 He's the only person on the ballot.

20:21.400 --> 20:25.300
 Every dictator from Hitler to Chavez, they all got elected.

20:25.300 --> 20:27.620
 Elections on their own mean literally nothing.

20:27.620 --> 20:31.320
 You have to have these other layers beneath to actually be an open and free society.

20:31.320 --> 20:35.640
 I think it's very important for people to understand.

20:35.640 --> 20:39.600
 Although Hitler in an interesting way, at a certain point just said, I'm going to be

20:39.600 --> 20:42.280
 a ruler forever, which is interesting.

20:42.280 --> 20:47.480
 There's an important switch that happens when you, as opposed to having a facade of elections,

20:47.480 --> 20:50.920
 you just put that aside and saying basically like, we're not even doing this.

20:50.920 --> 20:51.920
 Yeah.

20:51.920 --> 20:55.160
 There's like a ladder that you climb the election and you pull the ladder up and then no one

20:55.160 --> 20:56.160
 else can climb up.

20:56.160 --> 20:59.760
 This sadly happened in Egypt and it was quite predictable.

20:59.760 --> 21:06.200
 After Mubarak was ousted after the Arab Spring, Morsi came in and it looked like the Muslim

21:06.200 --> 21:09.680
 Brotherhood was not really going to be very democratic.

21:09.680 --> 21:12.600
 But it didn't really matter because then the military came back and now we have Sisi who's

21:12.600 --> 21:14.280
 even worse than Mubarak.

21:14.280 --> 21:19.200
 So a lot of times in these regimes, unfortunately, it's very difficult for people to build that

21:19.200 --> 21:22.220
 democratic society afterwards.

21:22.220 --> 21:25.960
 Some people have told me that when you live in a totalitarian or authoritarian regime,

21:25.960 --> 21:27.560
 it's kind of like a political desert.

21:27.560 --> 21:28.720
 What grows in the desert?

21:28.720 --> 21:30.400
 Scorpions and cacti, right?

21:30.400 --> 21:35.280
 So basically people with very extreme views because you as an authoritarian ruler, your

21:35.280 --> 21:38.520
 best method for control is to get rid of the moderates.

21:38.520 --> 21:39.640
 You have to crush the moderates.

21:39.640 --> 21:40.640
 That's very important.

21:40.640 --> 21:43.900
 You want to have the only opposition to you be extremists.

21:43.900 --> 21:47.160
 That way when you go and have negotiations with the United States, you can kind of hold

21:47.160 --> 21:51.360
 up the terrorists or whomever, the extremists and say, it's either us or them, right?

21:51.360 --> 21:54.100
 And then the realists who run the US government are going to choose you.

21:54.100 --> 21:57.880
 And that's why, one of the reasons why the US government has supported so many dictators

21:57.880 --> 22:00.720
 around the world over the last few decades.

22:00.720 --> 22:06.560
 Do you think authoritarian systems emerge naturally, like that's the natural state of

22:06.560 --> 22:07.560
 things.

22:07.560 --> 22:13.320
 If you incorporate what human nature is, is there always going to be corrupt people the

22:13.320 --> 22:14.320
 rise to the top?

22:14.320 --> 22:22.000
 And we almost have to construct systems that protect us against ourselves kind of thing.

22:22.000 --> 22:30.800
 Another way to ask that is what kind of systems protect us from our own human nature?

22:30.800 --> 22:34.640
 We started with authoritarianism or autocracy, right?

22:34.640 --> 22:41.480
 Ruled by one or a small group oligarchy, and all humans lived under this structure for,

22:41.480 --> 22:45.120
 you know, the virtual, you know, bulk of all human existence.

22:45.120 --> 22:49.080
 Only until pretty recently did we start having actual democracy.

22:49.080 --> 22:54.440
 The idea that we should be ruled by rules, not by rulers, very powerful.

22:54.440 --> 22:57.200
 Invented in many places across the world.

22:57.200 --> 23:01.100
 Western Africa had this idea and so did the ancient Greeks.

23:01.100 --> 23:02.840
 And they started to implement it.

23:02.840 --> 23:06.600
 Although as most know, we didn't have full democracy for a long, long time because it

23:06.600 --> 23:11.500
 was only property owners or only men, only people of a certain race.

23:11.500 --> 23:17.200
 But this idea that we can like rotate our rulers and that we could be ruled by rules

23:17.200 --> 23:23.560
 is extremely powerful and it really like for me, the ideas behind this, I think unlocked

23:23.560 --> 23:27.040
 a lot of the industrial revolution, these small personal freedoms that were allowed

23:27.040 --> 23:28.920
 in some countries, but not others.

23:28.920 --> 23:33.320
 And they unlocked a lot of the scientific innovation over the last few hundred years.

23:33.320 --> 23:36.920
 And to me, there's like a really straight line between like scientific inquiry, free

23:36.920 --> 23:42.920
 speech, freedoms, and then more prosperity and more effectiveness as a civilization.

23:42.920 --> 23:48.520
 So I think that democracy, you know, ruled by the people is definitely an upgrade from

23:48.520 --> 23:55.640
 autocracy or oligarchy, you know, which would be ruled by one or ruled by a small group.

23:55.640 --> 24:01.280
 And I think that the democratic revolution has been an incredible thing for our world.

24:01.280 --> 24:04.280
 And it's, you know, you can do half class full, half class empty.

24:04.280 --> 24:07.680
 The half class full is that almost half the world lives under democracy.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.920
 Like that's an incredible achievement.

24:10.920 --> 24:11.920
 But just under half.

24:11.920 --> 24:12.920
 Yeah.

24:12.920 --> 24:13.920
 Just under half.

24:13.920 --> 24:14.920
 So.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.600
 But that's billions of people.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.200
 It's billions of people.

24:18.200 --> 24:22.360
 And if you look at the progress of things, it's getting better and better and better.

24:22.360 --> 24:24.320
 I mean, if you, you know.

24:24.320 --> 24:25.320
 Yeah.

24:25.320 --> 24:28.800
 We're a little bit of a stalemate here.

24:28.800 --> 24:34.920
 Democracy's really blossomed between World War II and the year 2000, especially in the

24:34.920 --> 24:41.160
 eighties and nineties, you had an incredible wave of fall, you know, where many, many authoritarian

24:41.160 --> 24:43.960
 regimes fell and were replaced by democracies.

24:43.960 --> 24:52.440
 I think around 2015, the acceleration kind of came to a standstill a little bit.

24:52.440 --> 24:56.920
 There's some good news in some countries and there's bad news in others.

24:56.920 --> 25:02.760
 Like in the last 10 years, you've had, for example, the Philippines has gone backwards.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.560
 Thailand has gone backwards.

25:04.560 --> 25:05.960
 Bangladesh has gone backwards.

25:05.960 --> 25:07.480
 Turkey has gone backwards.

25:07.480 --> 25:09.120
 That's like a half billion people right there.

25:09.120 --> 25:16.360
 So you've had some positives, like, you know, there was positive movement forward in Armenia,

25:16.360 --> 25:21.280
 Malaysia, some other countries, but we're kind of at a stalemate right now.

25:21.280 --> 25:28.460
 And what most people fear about where we are right now, who I respect, is what is the digital

25:28.460 --> 25:34.520
 transformation of the world due to this like progress of democracy or of open societies.

25:34.520 --> 25:36.520
 And that's what concerns me the most.

25:36.520 --> 25:37.520
 Oh, interesting.

25:37.520 --> 25:42.840
 So I've, and we'll talk about one of the most fascinating technologies, which is Bitcoin,

25:42.840 --> 25:43.840
 how it can help.

25:43.840 --> 25:51.280
 But I have a sense that technology, like most technological innovations will give power

25:51.280 --> 25:59.160
 to the individuals, will fight authoritarian governments as opposed to give more power

25:59.160 --> 26:00.160
 to authoritarian governments.

26:00.160 --> 26:07.240
 But your sense is there's ways to give for technology to be utilized as a tool for the

26:07.240 --> 26:08.840
 abuse of the citizenry.

26:08.840 --> 26:10.480
 I've seen both.

26:10.480 --> 26:15.880
 In my work at Ahrefs, I started by helping to put together backpacks with foreign information

26:15.880 --> 26:18.620
 that we sent to the Cuban underground library movement.

26:18.620 --> 26:23.240
 So in Cuba, you know, to own a book at the time, you had to have the government's permission.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.160
 There's very little internet penetration.

26:25.160 --> 26:26.160
 Okay.

26:26.160 --> 26:30.600
 So we would send in movies, you know, V for Vendetta, dubbed into Spanish, and people

26:30.600 --> 26:35.400
 would sit inside their homes and they'd watch it and they would answer questions with each

26:35.400 --> 26:36.400
 other.

26:36.400 --> 26:37.400
 It was awful.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.800
 And then after that, I worked with people inside North Korea.

26:39.800 --> 26:40.800
 We would send in flash drives.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.800
 We have this program called Flash Drives for Freedom.

26:42.800 --> 26:48.560
 We've sent over 100,000 flash drives in our work into North Korea, a country of about

26:48.560 --> 26:49.560
 25 million people.

26:49.560 --> 26:50.560
 That's a lot.

26:50.560 --> 26:51.560
 It's a big, big difference.

26:51.560 --> 26:55.200
 That's, you know, many, many millions of hours of films, books, movies, etc.

26:55.200 --> 27:00.360
 So I've seen the power that technology can have where, you know, in the 60s and 70s,

27:00.360 --> 27:03.920
 you know, to get to break an information blockade, you had to like send in crates of books into

27:03.920 --> 27:05.440
 a communist country.

27:05.440 --> 27:10.200
 So now all of a sudden, you can send the entire contents of what was once the Library of Alexandria

27:10.200 --> 27:13.200
 on something the size of your thumbnail, like that's remarkable.

27:13.200 --> 27:17.240
 So obviously, I've seen the positives of technology and we'll certainly get into Bitcoin.

27:17.240 --> 27:22.520
 But I'm, you know, very concerned about essentially big data analysis, like what people call AI

27:22.520 --> 27:26.680
 or general, you know, specific kinds of AI, like very concerning.

27:26.680 --> 27:27.680
 I think these are very authoritarian.

27:27.680 --> 27:33.960
 I mean, it's very hard to make a case that AI is going to be good for human rights.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.960
 Very difficult, in my opinion.

27:35.960 --> 27:37.160
 It may be good for health.

27:37.160 --> 27:40.460
 It may be good for our efforts to protect the planet.

27:40.460 --> 27:43.020
 It may be good for a lot of scientific things.

27:43.020 --> 27:45.360
 I find it very hard to believe it'll be good for civil liberties.

27:45.360 --> 27:46.840
 Oh, that's fun.

27:46.840 --> 27:48.840
 This is fun because I disagree.

27:48.840 --> 27:51.560
 Give me your examples.

27:51.560 --> 27:52.800
 I'm serious.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.440
 What AI applications will improve civil liberties?

27:55.440 --> 28:00.760
 I thought you meant examples of stuff that's already out there, because I can give you

28:00.760 --> 28:05.480
 examples that, for example, the kind of things I would like to work on, but also the kind

28:05.480 --> 28:14.240
 of things I'm hoping to see, which is AI could be used by centralized powers, by governments,

28:14.240 --> 28:22.040
 by big organizations like Facebook and Twitter and so on to collect data about people.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.040
 Right.

28:23.040 --> 28:24.040
 Right.

28:24.040 --> 28:31.520
 I believe there's a huge hunger among people to have control over their own data.

28:31.520 --> 28:37.260
 So instead you can have AI that's distributed or people have complete ownership of their

28:37.260 --> 28:39.320
 little AI systems.

28:39.320 --> 28:45.120
 So like the kind of stuff that I would like to build or like to see it to be built is

28:45.120 --> 28:52.320
 you could think of it as personal assistance or AI that's owned by you and you get to give

28:52.320 --> 28:53.440
 it out.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.680
 You have complete control over all of your data.

28:55.680 --> 29:01.740
 You have complete control over everything that's learnable about your day to day experiences

29:01.740 --> 29:08.240
 that could be useful in the market of goods and ideas and all those kinds of things.

29:08.240 --> 29:14.760
 So it has to do with, so I know you talk about the surveillance, which is very interesting.

29:14.760 --> 29:17.680
 It's who gets to have control of the data.

29:17.680 --> 29:26.560
 And I think, I believe there's a lot of hunger in among regular people to have control over

29:26.560 --> 29:32.840
 their data such that if you want to create a business, you have a lot of money to be

29:32.840 --> 29:38.520
 made from a capitalist perspective by providing products that let people control their data

29:38.520 --> 29:41.040
 where you have no control.

29:41.040 --> 29:45.980
 Sounds like to me you're describing encryption or at least the ability to encrypt, the ability

29:45.980 --> 29:50.000
 to use digital keys to secure your property.

29:50.000 --> 29:56.600
 And that to me is a very powerful force for individual rights, very powerful.

29:56.600 --> 30:00.260
 And it's what animates Bitcoin ultimately, which we'll get into.

30:00.260 --> 30:07.320
 But for me, at least the way I look at it today in 2021, the threat from big data analysis

30:07.320 --> 30:09.800
 used by governments and authoritarian regimes is terrifying.

30:09.800 --> 30:14.360
 I mean, to actually see what the Chinese Communist Party is doing where they have hundreds of

30:14.360 --> 30:19.640
 millions of cameras overseeing society, cameras that can tell who's a Uyghur and who's a

30:19.640 --> 30:24.440
 Ham, that to me is terrifying and everything is sorted instantly.

30:24.440 --> 30:30.840
 There are supercomputers that are built in Urumqi, in Xinjiang for this explicit purpose.

30:30.840 --> 30:35.720
 And it allows the government to quickly sort and basically commit genocide a lot faster

30:35.720 --> 30:37.120
 and it's really scary.

30:37.120 --> 30:42.680
 So I do agree and I've seen personally how powerful technology can be as a force for

30:42.680 --> 30:47.960
 freedom, but I'm very, very worried about big data analysis in the hands of governments.

30:47.960 --> 30:53.200
 See, that's funny because I tend to see governments as ultimately incompetent in the space of

30:53.200 --> 30:56.080
 technology to where there will always be lagging behind.

30:56.080 --> 31:01.960
 So you look at what the Chinese surveillance systems are doing, I believe once it starts

31:01.960 --> 31:09.200
 getting bad enough that technologies would be created to resist that.

31:09.200 --> 31:14.880
 So to mess with it from the hacker community, but also from the individual community.

31:14.880 --> 31:20.640
 So surveillance is actually very difficult from a centralized perspective to collect

31:20.640 --> 31:24.880
 data about you, to detect everything you are because you can spoof a lot of that information.

31:24.880 --> 31:29.920
 So I believe you can put power in the hands of the citizens to sort of feed the government

31:29.920 --> 31:38.040
 fake data to confuse it at a mass scale to where it'll make their surveillance less effective.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.440
 That could be very sort of hopeful.

31:39.440 --> 31:40.440
 Yeah.

31:40.440 --> 31:44.880
 I mean, the practical application in Xinjiang, which is a territory the size of Alaska, where

31:44.880 --> 31:48.960
 a large percentage of the population has been put into prison camps.

31:48.960 --> 31:53.540
 The current issue of the New Yorker has an absolutely harrowing essay that tells the

31:53.540 --> 32:00.000
 story of one such woman who in, I believe, 2017 got sucked into one of these camps and

32:00.000 --> 32:04.040
 it took her a year or more to get out.

32:04.040 --> 32:09.640
 And she's talking about how in each home in Xinjiang, each home has a QR code on it that

32:09.640 --> 32:13.440
 the police can scan and get like a quick instant download of who lives there.

32:13.440 --> 32:17.840
 Each car has, you know, like a scannable code.

32:17.840 --> 32:22.840
 Every single person has their DNA taken and the DNA is being sifted through and analyzed

32:22.840 --> 32:24.240
 by algorithms.

32:24.240 --> 32:28.880
 So this is like the Chinese government's laboratory for how can we use technology to oppress.

32:28.880 --> 32:31.400
 It's like sort of like digital Leninism.

32:31.400 --> 32:36.600
 And that to me is one of the biggest risks in our world today and it's not talked about

32:36.600 --> 32:37.600
 enough.

32:37.600 --> 32:38.600
 That's interesting.

32:38.600 --> 32:42.760
 So technology is basically enables the automation of oppression.

32:42.760 --> 32:43.760
 Absolutely.

32:43.760 --> 32:44.760
 So like...

32:44.760 --> 32:51.800
 But to define technology, big data analysis and, you know, maybe specific AI, etc. does,

32:51.800 --> 32:53.880
 but encryption allows us to fight back.

32:53.880 --> 32:56.240
 It's very important people understand we have tools to fight back.

32:56.240 --> 33:02.280
 The, you know, big brother can only grow if it can feed on your data.

33:02.280 --> 33:04.720
 If it can't get your data, it can't grow.

33:04.720 --> 33:10.280
 So you have to willingly give up stuff to the cloud for this monster to grow.

33:10.280 --> 33:15.220
 We can like make the monster hungry and shrink it if we give it less data.

33:15.220 --> 33:18.260
 And I think that's where I would agree with you in terms of like wanting to empower people

33:18.260 --> 33:22.880
 to be able to do stuff on their own terms in a sovereign way.

33:22.880 --> 33:26.800
 And yeah, maybe you're kind of thinking like the personal assistant who helps out Tony

33:26.800 --> 33:28.800
 Stark or something like that.

33:28.800 --> 33:32.160
 And that's, yeah, as long as there's no back doors and that's a sovereign thing that you've

33:32.160 --> 33:36.100
 popped up and created and you have the keys to, absolutely.

33:36.100 --> 33:42.480
 But practically speaking, if we're talking about the world today as is, we need to be

33:42.480 --> 33:46.840
 concerned about the way that authoritarian regimes are using big data analysis and they're

33:46.840 --> 33:50.080
 going to buy this software and this equipment from the Chinese government, they're already

33:50.080 --> 33:51.240
 doing it.

33:51.240 --> 33:54.520
 State level surveillance has already been purchased by governments everywhere from Latin

33:54.520 --> 33:57.640
 America to Sub Saharan Africa to the heart of Europe.

33:57.640 --> 34:03.640
 There's been huge scandals in Britain over their purchase of Chinese surveillance technology.

34:03.640 --> 34:08.360
 Part of the Chinese government's Belt and Road campaign, which is basically to build

34:08.360 --> 34:13.560
 the infrastructure of this century and to be in control of it, part of that idea is

34:13.560 --> 34:19.760
 to ship out and install surveillance technology both at the telecom level and at the surveillance

34:19.760 --> 34:24.080
 level across dozens of countries around the world and have that back door.

34:24.080 --> 34:28.480
 There's this national security law in China, which states that companies that are Chinese,

34:28.480 --> 34:32.120
 which are abroad, are mandated to send data back to Beijing.

34:32.120 --> 34:35.480
 So they are building this huge global surveillance state.

34:35.480 --> 34:39.680
 And again, not talked about enough, you should go Google and research the Belt and Road.

34:39.680 --> 34:42.440
 I think it's very important that we confront this.

34:42.440 --> 34:48.240
 Yeah, I'm really glad you're talking about it because it's probably important to understand.

34:48.240 --> 34:56.520
 I'm also hopeful that as people get educated about how much their data, when collected,

34:56.520 --> 35:00.520
 unencrypted, but in general, can be used to harm them.

35:00.520 --> 35:02.840
 I mean, it's almost like an education.

35:02.840 --> 35:10.360
 I feel like if you know, it's a double edged sword because I feel like people become fearful

35:10.360 --> 35:14.680
 too easily and that actually has a very negative effect on the quality of life.

35:14.680 --> 35:18.560
 In some sense, you want to have tools that allow you to live freely as opposed to live

35:18.560 --> 35:19.560
 in fear.

35:19.560 --> 35:22.560
 If you live in fear, it's not a good way to live.

35:22.560 --> 35:23.560
 So it's a balance.

35:23.560 --> 35:26.000
 It's a free society versus a fear society.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
 Yeah, fear society.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.560
 And look, people are, it's all about the trade offs you make in your daily life.

35:30.560 --> 35:35.760
 Like living more privately with more freedom is less convenient.

35:35.760 --> 35:41.120
 You trade freedom and privacy for convenience and comfort and speed.

35:41.120 --> 35:42.120
 Absolutely.

35:42.120 --> 35:45.700
 And the engineering decision and everything that you do.

35:45.700 --> 35:53.840
 In the West, in advanced democracies, we have not necessarily personally seen the results

35:53.840 --> 35:57.640
 of that trade off because we live in these free societies that have these checks and

35:57.640 --> 35:59.240
 balances and freedoms.

35:59.240 --> 36:02.840
 But as soon as you step into an authoritarian state and you make those trade offs, your

36:02.840 --> 36:06.280
 life immediately becomes more restrictive.

36:06.280 --> 36:12.560
 And what people are worried about is that even in advanced economies, market democracies,

36:12.560 --> 36:20.220
 etc., people are worried that they might not survive the great social digital transformation.

36:20.220 --> 36:22.640
 You know, look at what the NSA is capable of doing.

36:22.640 --> 36:29.060
 I mean, for now, it's not that big of a problem because we still have free speech.

36:29.060 --> 36:31.800
 But it's deeply concerning what Snowden revealed.

36:31.800 --> 36:37.520
 And it's a nice reminder that we need to be focused on privacy and encryption and on helping

36:37.520 --> 36:41.440
 users become more sovereign regardless of where you live.

36:41.440 --> 36:43.840
 It's kind of like a crutch to live in a free society.

36:43.840 --> 36:47.680
 Like, you know, it's almost like a free lunch in a way.

36:47.680 --> 36:50.960
 You're not going to be sent to a prison camp because of the color of your skin or your

36:50.960 --> 36:54.140
 beliefs or what you say about the government.

36:54.140 --> 36:55.280
 And you're very lucky.

36:55.280 --> 37:00.600
 Again, most people do live in a society where you can be persecuted for those things.

37:00.600 --> 37:05.680
 And I feel like, especially in America, we forget that we're distanced from that really

37:05.680 --> 37:08.080
 strong reality, you know.

37:08.080 --> 37:13.040
 On the topic of Snowden and the NSA, what should we be thinking about?

37:13.040 --> 37:17.420
 Because that feels like already an outdated set of conversations because of the information

37:17.420 --> 37:19.440
 we've gotten from the past.

37:19.440 --> 37:22.880
 It feels like everything's gotten quiet now in terms of how much we actually know about

37:22.880 --> 37:23.880
 the...

37:23.880 --> 37:24.880
 No, it's hugely important.

37:24.880 --> 37:30.180
 I think the two lessons from Snowden are, A, the Patriot Act and the War on Terror and

37:30.180 --> 37:36.000
 mass surveillance are not necessary for our democracy and for our freedoms.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.240
 This was a false choice.

37:37.240 --> 37:40.640
 We never had to sacrifice them to be safer.

37:40.640 --> 37:41.640
 And we've seen that.

37:41.640 --> 37:44.920
 The government has spent hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars on these like surveillance

37:44.920 --> 37:49.780
 programs that you can read about have amounted to very little, except for tremendous bureaucratic

37:49.780 --> 37:54.280
 waste and, you know, erosion of our freedoms.

37:54.280 --> 37:57.400
 But at the same time, we need to practice more privacy.

37:57.400 --> 38:02.920
 And the dramatic increase in the usage of Signal, for example, has been really, really

38:02.920 --> 38:04.240
 great to see.

38:04.240 --> 38:08.400
 It's fantastic that tens of millions of people are downloading Signal and using it.

38:08.400 --> 38:13.600
 You should try to be onboarding more and more of your conversations onto Signal, for example,

38:13.600 --> 38:16.480
 where governments can't see what you're saying.

38:16.480 --> 38:18.000
 Maybe they can see the metadata.

38:18.000 --> 38:22.200
 Maybe they can see that you sent your phone number, sent a message to someone else's phone

38:22.200 --> 38:25.120
 number at this time, but they can't see what's inside.

38:25.120 --> 38:27.680
 So using encryption in your life is very, very important.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.040
 That's a good starting point.

38:29.040 --> 38:32.480
 I would say that's kind of step A.

38:32.480 --> 38:40.280
 The ideas of democracy, the ideas of the balance of power, all the ideas that we were talking

38:40.280 --> 38:44.120
 about, the constructs, were inventions.

38:44.120 --> 38:50.640
 I wonder if there's other inventions that will allow us to sort of not engage, not give

38:50.640 --> 38:56.120
 governments or any centralized institutions so much power.

38:56.120 --> 38:59.920
 Why do citizens have to use Signal?

38:59.920 --> 39:00.920
 Because it's an effort.

39:00.920 --> 39:03.920
 You have to understand exactly why.

39:03.920 --> 39:06.520
 So that's a nice little solution for a particular set of problems.

39:06.520 --> 39:11.640
 But there's a million other ways that data, I'm sure, is being collected constantly.

39:11.640 --> 39:18.840
 If we don't create a system that prevents the establishment of these centralized powers,

39:18.840 --> 39:20.720
 then we'll always have this problem.

39:20.720 --> 39:23.760
 Yeah, I think we can keep it simple for the purposes of this conversation.

39:23.760 --> 39:26.020
 You have politics, information, and money.

39:26.020 --> 39:28.880
 Those are the three things I would encourage us to focus on.

39:28.880 --> 39:31.400
 In politics, yes, someone invented democracy.

39:31.400 --> 39:36.560
 I mean, whether it was the Greeks, the West Africans, or many others around the world

39:36.560 --> 39:42.840
 around the same time invented this idea that we should be ruled by rules and not by rulers.

39:42.840 --> 39:45.920
 And that has evolved dramatically.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.320
 And then you have information.

39:47.320 --> 39:50.160
 Information also used to be highly centralized, right?

39:50.160 --> 39:54.840
 Think about how rich you had to be to gain access to a library before the printing press,

39:54.840 --> 40:00.060
 or how much money you had to have, or how close to the king or the feudal lord you had

40:00.060 --> 40:02.680
 to be to be able to have that ability.

40:02.680 --> 40:08.040
 But now, the majority of the world, billions of people have access to all information in

40:08.040 --> 40:11.600
 their pocket, and they can set up an account on social media and get their word out.

40:11.600 --> 40:17.240
 So not only politics, but information has been dramatically decentralized.

40:17.240 --> 40:22.760
 And I would say that encrypted messaging is kind of a corollary to that second innovation

40:22.760 --> 40:28.240
 in as much as now people are like more effortlessly, like Signal is a lot easier to use than PGP,

40:28.240 --> 40:29.720
 for example.

40:29.720 --> 40:36.100
 They're more easily able to practice privacy when it comes to having private messages globally.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.440
 These are all good things and we need to keep pushing.

40:38.440 --> 40:42.680
 And I think money is like, honestly, maybe the most important piece.

40:42.680 --> 40:45.360
 And that's why I spent so much time thinking about Bitcoin.

40:45.360 --> 40:52.280
 Okay, so politics, information, money, yes, let's talk about money.

40:52.280 --> 40:53.280
 What is money?

40:53.280 --> 40:58.480
 Why is it important to think about in the context of human rights?

40:58.480 --> 41:06.600
 I have witnessed money be peripheralized, it has taken a backseat in the human rights

41:06.600 --> 41:07.600
 conversation.

41:07.600 --> 41:12.360
 The idea of currency, who makes the money, who makes the rules, who issues it, who sets

41:12.360 --> 41:17.200
 the interest rates, all these things, it is not on the menu of human rights activists.

41:17.200 --> 41:20.520
 If you just do like a systematic study of like the human rights discourse over the last

41:20.520 --> 41:23.560
 several decades, money is not there.

41:23.560 --> 41:25.160
 It's also not really taught in schools.

41:25.160 --> 41:28.400
 Like children don't really learn about money, where does it come from?

41:28.400 --> 41:33.760
 It's kind of hidden from a lot of our discourse.

41:33.760 --> 41:37.840
 Only really when I got into Bitcoin did I started learning more about money.

41:37.840 --> 41:42.640
 I spent 10 years at the Human Rights Foundation and we did all kinds of programs around the

41:42.640 --> 41:43.640
 world.

41:43.640 --> 41:47.980
 We convened Oslo Freedom Forums in different places and I got to meet hundreds of dissidents.

41:47.980 --> 41:51.960
 And very rarely did they ever speak about currency or bank accounts or moving money

41:51.960 --> 41:53.800
 from one place to another.

41:53.800 --> 41:58.280
 But when I started asking them, they always had amazing stories about money, always.

41:58.280 --> 42:03.220
 I mean, my friend, Ivan Mawire, who started the This Flag movement in Zimbabwe, which

42:03.220 --> 42:07.620
 ended up toppling Robert Mugabe, when I asked him to come to San Francisco to give a talk

42:07.620 --> 42:10.400
 about hyperinflation, which he lived through.

42:10.400 --> 42:13.360
 He said, no one's ever asked me to do that before, but I'll come.

42:13.360 --> 42:15.620
 And he came, this was about three years ago.

42:15.620 --> 42:18.400
 And the first thing he did when he got on the stage is he opened up a shirt and he brought

42:18.400 --> 42:21.880
 out a necklace that had the 1980 Zimbabwean dollar on it.

42:21.880 --> 42:26.520
 And he said, we in the activist community wear this as a symbol of where our country

42:26.520 --> 42:30.540
 used to be because the Zimbabwean dollar used to be worth two British pounds.

42:30.540 --> 42:35.660
 And then of course, over the next two and a half decades of economic mismanagement and

42:35.660 --> 42:38.620
 corruption by Mugabe, it got inflated out of existence, right?

42:38.620 --> 42:41.920
 You've seen those like a hundred trillion dollars in Zimbabwean notes.

42:41.920 --> 42:47.000
 So he had to live through that, which was terrible and crushing, but he is an expert

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
 on money.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.880
 If you actually talk to human rights activists about money, they know a lot about money.

42:51.880 --> 42:54.320
 They're just not usually asked to talk about it.

42:54.320 --> 43:02.320
 So for me, when I study money or look at money, it's really about control, who's creating

43:02.320 --> 43:06.580
 it, and how much does the population know about the creation of that money.

43:06.580 --> 43:09.440
 And when it comes to Bitcoin, it's really the people's money.

43:09.440 --> 43:12.600
 Like there is no shadowy force in charge of it.

43:12.600 --> 43:14.060
 We all know the rules.

43:14.060 --> 43:17.560
 We all know how it's going to get minted and how it's going to get printed.

43:17.560 --> 43:20.500
 And you know, that information is out there for everybody to see.

43:20.500 --> 43:25.300
 And there's no like special group of rules for one group of people or another group.

43:25.300 --> 43:30.200
 You know, a billionaire and a refugee are the same in the eyes of the protocol.

43:30.200 --> 43:33.220
 This is a rather revolutionary concept.

43:33.220 --> 43:38.160
 And in the same way that democracy allowed us to decentralize politics and have checks

43:38.160 --> 43:39.160
 and balances.

43:39.160 --> 43:42.900
 And in the same way that the internet is this culmination of technologies that allowed us

43:42.900 --> 43:48.960
 to decentralize information, access to and control over it, Bitcoin, you know, decentralizes

43:48.960 --> 43:49.960
 money.

43:49.960 --> 43:54.980
 I mean, no longer, again, is there one group of people who can just change it arbitrarily.

43:54.980 --> 43:57.020
 We're all in the same playing field.

43:57.020 --> 44:01.120
 And I think that that is a tremendous innovation.

44:01.120 --> 44:06.220
 You know, from one perspective, money and inflation, hyperinflation is a kind of symptom

44:06.220 --> 44:12.020
 of corruption, as opposed to the core of the corruption.

44:12.020 --> 44:18.480
 And at the flip side, in terms of resisting the corruption, resisting the abuse of human

44:18.480 --> 44:28.940
 rights, it's interesting to think that fighting inflation or fighting the mismanagement of

44:28.940 --> 44:38.380
 the money supply is a way to fight back authoritarianism or to fight authoritarianism.

44:38.380 --> 44:44.020
 And that's an interesting concept that I think was introduced to me by just plugging myself

44:44.020 --> 44:49.220
 intellectually into the Bitcoin community, but also just cryptocurrency in general, is

44:49.220 --> 44:54.840
 to like, it's not that money is a symptom.

44:54.840 --> 44:58.780
 You know, money is a tool to fight back, too.

44:58.780 --> 45:00.260
 Absolutely.

45:00.260 --> 45:10.380
 So in what way can Bitcoin be used to fight authoritarianism, not just in the United States,

45:10.380 --> 45:15.420
 but all of those 53% that you're referring to, how can Bitcoin help?

45:15.420 --> 45:20.300
 So we talked about authoritarianism, and we talked about the surveillance state.

45:20.300 --> 45:26.060
 To me, Bitcoin has two kind of key mechanisms through which it can help us.

45:26.060 --> 45:29.260
 Number one, it's a sovereign savings account.

45:29.260 --> 45:33.800
 It's debasement proof, meaning the government cannot print more whenever they want.

45:33.800 --> 45:38.620
 This is very, very different from fiat currency, which by its very name, its very nature can

45:38.620 --> 45:42.100
 be issued on sort of demand, right, by the rulers.

45:42.100 --> 45:47.580
 And while I live in a country where the rulers do a reasonable job managing the money, most

45:47.580 --> 45:48.860
 people aren't so lucky.

45:48.860 --> 45:53.560
 So only 13% of humans in the world live in a country that's a liberal democracy with

45:53.560 --> 45:58.400
 property rights and has what we call a reserve currency, meaning a currency so stable and

45:58.400 --> 46:02.180
 desirable that other countries save in it at the central bank level, right?

46:02.180 --> 46:08.700
 You basically have the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Switzerland, the Euro, and Canada.

46:08.700 --> 46:10.740
 I mean, those are like reserve currencies.

46:10.740 --> 46:14.680
 And these are liberal democracies where people have reasonable guarantees over property rights.

46:14.680 --> 46:19.520
 Everybody else either lives under like a weaker currency or an authoritarian regime.

46:19.520 --> 46:22.800
 That's 87% of the world's population, almost 7 billion people.

46:22.800 --> 46:27.580
 So for them, a sovereign savings account that's permissionless, meaning you don't have to

46:27.580 --> 46:30.360
 have ID to use it, is a big, big deal.

46:30.360 --> 46:34.300
 And a lot of people talk about Zimbabwe or Venezuela as some like isolated cases.

46:34.300 --> 46:38.700
 Oh, well, you know, hyperinflation only happens in those two countries.

46:38.700 --> 46:45.420
 I actually did some research into this and there's about one point, over, you know, close

46:45.420 --> 46:49.260
 to 1.3 billion people who live under double or triple digit inflation.

46:49.260 --> 46:51.340
 This is not an isolated instance.

46:51.340 --> 46:57.740
 We're talking huge countries, Nigeria, 200 million people, 15% inflation, Turkey, 15%

46:57.740 --> 47:02.860
 inflation for 100 million people, Argentina, 40% inflation for a country of 45 million

47:02.860 --> 47:03.860
 people.

47:03.860 --> 47:08.420
 So you can go down the list, there's about 35 countries where like people's earnings,

47:08.420 --> 47:13.100
 their wages are literally disappearing in front of their eyes over a matter of weeks

47:13.100 --> 47:17.380
 or months against things like the dollar or gold or real estate, right?

47:17.380 --> 47:19.540
 So this is a huge issue.

47:19.540 --> 47:21.220
 It absolutely is a human rights issue for me.

47:21.220 --> 47:25.220
 I mean, when it comes to your time and energy, having control over that or having it stolen

47:25.220 --> 47:27.980
 from you, I think this is pretty clear.

47:27.980 --> 47:34.100
 And Bitcoin is like an immediate, low cost, easily accessible solution for people.

47:34.100 --> 47:39.140
 And I've learned this not from my own assumptions, but by talking to people, by interviewing

47:39.140 --> 47:47.300
 dozens of people, whether it's in Sudan, which currently has triple digit inflation, or people

47:47.300 --> 47:51.620
 who've escaped from Syria, who have used Bitcoin to get their wealth out of the country, and

47:51.620 --> 47:55.900
 then also to make payments back to people inside, or Venezuela or elsewhere.

47:55.900 --> 47:58.260
 It's very, very powerful.

47:58.260 --> 48:03.220
 I think some very small percentage of people who have used, have owned Bitcoin was something

48:03.220 --> 48:04.220
 like 1%, right?

48:04.220 --> 48:07.140
 Of the world, whatever that number is, it's small.

48:07.140 --> 48:12.020
 Call it 2% for the purposes of our, about a little under 200 million people.

48:12.020 --> 48:13.020
 Wow.

48:13.020 --> 48:14.020
 Yeah.

48:14.020 --> 48:15.140
 At most, right now.

48:15.140 --> 48:18.060
 So if we look at Zimbabwe, Sudan, if we look at...

48:18.060 --> 48:19.980
 Small percentages of people.

48:19.980 --> 48:22.060
 Do you think the technology is mature enough?

48:22.060 --> 48:25.860
 Because it's not just about the idea, it's also about the implementation of it.

48:25.860 --> 48:32.900
 Like Bitcoin, for the most part, requires access to the internet.

48:32.900 --> 48:33.900
 Yeah.

48:33.900 --> 48:41.860
 And what do you think about accessibility of this technology now as a method of activism

48:41.860 --> 48:43.420
 in the worst parts of the world?

48:43.420 --> 48:47.820
 We often think like all the conversations we've had about Bitcoin is essentially middle

48:47.820 --> 48:51.220
 class, like wealthy people relative to the rest of the world.

48:51.220 --> 48:56.060
 They're kind of talking sort of investment and high concept ideas.

48:56.060 --> 48:59.820
 Then there's also the people in the world who are suffering, who are living through

48:59.820 --> 49:00.820
 hyperinflation.

49:00.820 --> 49:03.940
 They may not have a computer or access to the internet.

49:03.940 --> 49:05.820
 How do you think Bitcoin can help there?

49:05.820 --> 49:06.820
 Yeah.

49:06.820 --> 49:11.140
 So again, we have one clear use case, which is a sovereign savings account that you can

49:11.140 --> 49:12.140
 control, right?

49:12.140 --> 49:15.260
 The other use case is an unstoppable payments network.

49:15.260 --> 49:19.540
 This is very important for people who live behind, for example, sanctions, like the US

49:19.540 --> 49:24.400
 like basically weaponizes the dollar and like sanctions different countries.

49:24.400 --> 49:28.420
 And instead of sanctioning like a handful of rulers, for example, which I would support,

49:28.420 --> 49:31.020
 this is like a Magnitsky or smart sanctions.

49:31.020 --> 49:33.180
 Sometimes we'll just say, we're just going to shut off this whole country.

49:33.180 --> 49:34.180
 So the people suffer.

49:34.180 --> 49:36.200
 Cuba or Iran are good examples.

49:36.200 --> 49:37.700
 Average people suffer, right?

49:37.700 --> 49:42.900
 So people in those two countries I just mentioned, Cuba, Iran, or even Palestine, which is also

49:42.900 --> 49:45.540
 sort of like blockaded by the Israelis.

49:45.540 --> 49:49.660
 So you have Cuba, Iran, Palestine are three good examples where people inside all three

49:49.660 --> 49:54.060
 of those countries now are using Bitcoin to do commerce, do their business, send money

49:54.060 --> 49:55.060
 back and forth.

49:55.060 --> 49:56.740
 So sanctions resistant.

49:56.740 --> 49:57.740
 Sanctions resistant.

49:57.740 --> 50:01.140
 It does not get stopped by sanctions, right?

50:01.140 --> 50:03.940
 And also it's, again, remittances are extortionate.

50:03.940 --> 50:09.600
 I mean, the average remittance, you know, costs has a high fee, takes several days.

50:09.600 --> 50:13.340
 If your family is in Ghana or something like that, or Nigeria, and you live in the United

50:13.340 --> 50:16.380
 States, it can take time to use Western Union.

50:16.380 --> 50:20.980
 Sometimes it gets paused, it gets lost, there's issues, you have to deal with customer service.

50:20.980 --> 50:21.980
 Screw that.

50:21.980 --> 50:26.200
 I mean, you know, if the person has a cell phone, which increasingly is the case, I mean,

50:26.200 --> 50:31.460
 by the end of next year, more than five or six billion people depending on different

50:31.460 --> 50:35.740
 estimates will have smartphones basically by the end of 2022.

50:35.740 --> 50:40.140
 We're talking like the vast majority of humans will have access to smartphones.

50:40.140 --> 50:42.500
 They can all have sovereign Bitcoin wallets.

50:42.500 --> 50:47.300
 And there's even ways to access Bitcoin without the internet.

50:47.300 --> 50:48.860
 But I mean, we can get into that.

50:48.860 --> 50:50.580
 There's like hardware wallets and so on.

50:50.580 --> 50:55.460
 What do you mean by sovereign Bitcoin wallet?

50:55.460 --> 51:00.360
 You know, most users today are using Bitcoin in a custodial manner.

51:00.360 --> 51:06.700
 So this is kind of like having a bank account where you have a deposit account at a bank,

51:06.700 --> 51:07.700
 right?

51:07.700 --> 51:08.700
 So you have a claim, right?

51:08.700 --> 51:12.260
 You go to the bank and they have some of your money and you take it out, right?

51:12.260 --> 51:13.360
 With an ATM.

51:13.360 --> 51:20.220
 So what I would call noncustodial Bitcoin use would be similar to withdrawing cash from

51:20.220 --> 51:21.220
 an ATM.

51:21.220 --> 51:22.220
 You have it.

51:22.220 --> 51:23.220
 It's a bearer instrument.

51:23.220 --> 51:24.220
 OK, so when I...

51:24.220 --> 51:25.220
 Bearer instrument.

51:25.220 --> 51:26.220
 That's what it's called.

51:26.220 --> 51:27.220
 It's a bearer instrument.

51:27.220 --> 51:28.220
 I know.

51:28.220 --> 51:29.220
 I apologize.

51:29.220 --> 51:30.220
 I'm outside this community.

51:30.220 --> 51:36.380
 I'm in a bar of gold or a banknote or Bitcoin that you control, meaning you have the seed

51:36.380 --> 51:37.380
 phrase, right?

51:37.380 --> 51:42.000
 Which for the listeners essentially is 12 to 24 English words that you write down on

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
 a piece of paper.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.340
 That's your like password to get into your Bitcoin account.

51:46.340 --> 51:49.520
 And that gives you that bearer instrument quality, right?

51:49.520 --> 51:55.500
 But unfortunately, most users still use Bitcoin in a custodial way, meaning they buy it on

51:55.500 --> 51:58.460
 Coinbase or Square or something like that.

51:58.460 --> 52:04.020
 You would put into the custodial into the custodial category like a bank.

52:04.020 --> 52:07.660
 And look, the good news is you can withdraw to your own control.

52:07.660 --> 52:11.420
 And in the Bitcoin community, we try to teach this idea that it's not your keys, not your

52:11.420 --> 52:15.100
 coins in the same way that if you deposit your money at the bank, you might not get

52:15.100 --> 52:16.100
 it back.

52:16.100 --> 52:19.740
 I mean, it's low likelihood, but it's very possible.

52:19.740 --> 52:20.740
 Same thing in Bitcoin.

52:20.740 --> 52:24.380
 Like if you want to get the full experience, you want to actually custody your own Bitcoin.

52:24.380 --> 52:28.660
 You want to put it whether it's on an open source software wallet, like the blue wallet

52:28.660 --> 52:33.660
 is a good one for people to check out or a hardware wallet like cold card, for example.

52:33.660 --> 52:35.640
 There's different ways to do this.

52:35.640 --> 52:39.620
 But essentially, like around the world, people are innovating.

52:39.620 --> 52:41.940
 Like don't think so low of your fellow man.

52:41.940 --> 52:42.940
 You know what I mean?

52:42.940 --> 52:44.700
 Like people are able to figure this out.

52:44.700 --> 52:47.780
 You know, I get a lot of flak from people saying, oh, Bitcoin is so hard to use.

52:47.780 --> 52:50.860
 I read this article in the New York Times saying this guy in Silicon Valley lost all

52:50.860 --> 52:51.960
 of his Bitcoin.

52:51.960 --> 52:54.220
 That's because he was a moron and didn't care about it.

52:54.220 --> 52:58.260
 This guy lost all this Bitcoin because it wasn't worth much 10 years ago and he, you

52:58.260 --> 52:59.540
 know, he forgot the password.

52:59.540 --> 53:03.380
 But if you're like receiving your remittance from a family member, you're going to lose

53:03.380 --> 53:04.380
 the password.

53:04.380 --> 53:05.380
 Right.

53:05.380 --> 53:09.100
 And you trust in the basic intelligence of people to figure this out and to innovate

53:09.100 --> 53:10.740
 and so on and figure out.

53:10.740 --> 53:12.740
 We're watching it, man.

53:12.740 --> 53:13.740
 Yeah.

53:13.740 --> 53:18.540
 You know, I'm, it's kind of funny that, but people in the United States are not very savvy

53:18.540 --> 53:20.020
 with money.

53:20.020 --> 53:24.740
 It's exactly the way you're describing is like when you have very little money, you're

53:24.740 --> 53:27.060
 going to be savvy with money.

53:27.060 --> 53:32.260
 You're going to understand exactly the mechanisms that work, that are resistant to the corruption

53:32.260 --> 53:33.260
 that's around you.

53:33.260 --> 53:40.100
 I mean, I remember sort of growing up in the Soviet Union, the general bureaucracy and

53:40.100 --> 53:44.060
 the corruption of everything around you, you figure out ways around that.

53:44.060 --> 53:49.340
 You figure out ways how to function within that kind of system to survive under inflation,

53:49.340 --> 53:54.420
 under hyperinflation, under all like basically being unable to trust any kind of, even the

53:54.420 --> 53:56.200
 police force and all those kinds of things.

53:56.200 --> 54:01.340
 You figure it out and that same way, perhaps Bitcoin could be all the different ways to

54:01.340 --> 54:05.540
 store and gain Bitcoin.

54:05.540 --> 54:09.340
 These mechanisms could be something that's figured out in the third world as opposed

54:09.340 --> 54:10.340
 to in the United States.

54:10.340 --> 54:14.580
 Oh, I mean, I would say the capital of Bitcoin could easily be Lagos and not San Francisco

54:14.580 --> 54:17.140
 in terms of users, in terms of people using it.

54:17.140 --> 54:22.100
 And again, the two use cases as a savings account and as an unstoppable payment rail.

54:22.100 --> 54:24.740
 These are the two ones that you should really think about, this is how people are using

54:24.740 --> 54:25.740
 it today.

54:25.740 --> 54:31.540
 Now, when it comes to, could it possibly be adopted by like a sufficient majority of the

54:31.540 --> 54:32.540
 population?

54:32.540 --> 54:33.540
 I say, yes.

54:33.540 --> 54:36.460
 And it's very similar to the way the mobile phone spread.

54:36.460 --> 54:40.820
 At the beginning, the cell phone was only for rich people, it was only for the elite,

54:40.820 --> 54:44.740
 it was huge, it didn't work very well, the interface sucked, it was clunky.

54:44.740 --> 54:49.060
 Over time, it got smaller and smaller and cheaper and cheaper and easier to use and

54:49.060 --> 54:50.060
 easier to use.

54:50.060 --> 54:52.060
 And today, everyone benefits.

54:52.060 --> 54:55.940
 So you're going to watch a similar technology upgrade process with Bitcoin.

54:55.940 --> 54:59.460
 Already in the last 10 years, Bitcoin has gotten so much easier to use.

54:59.460 --> 55:02.580
 I mean, there are now mobile wallets that are so slick.

55:02.580 --> 55:06.520
 There's one called Moon M U U N wallet from a team in Argentina.

55:06.520 --> 55:11.220
 And these guys created it because they saw their own currency devalued like three times

55:11.220 --> 55:12.820
 in the last 20 years.

55:12.820 --> 55:15.860
 And they've had a hell of a time trying to get their money back and forth in different

55:15.860 --> 55:16.860
 countries.

55:16.860 --> 55:18.540
 So they were like, let's make this easy for people.

55:18.540 --> 55:22.420
 Again, you know, this is the people's money.

55:22.420 --> 55:25.980
 This is something that cannot be controlled by governments or corporations.

55:25.980 --> 55:27.940
 And that makes it very powerful.

55:27.940 --> 55:32.020
 And I think it's actually quite exciting to be here in the adoption phase.

55:32.020 --> 55:33.020
 In the early days.

55:33.020 --> 55:34.660
 Yeah, man, this is the early days.

55:34.660 --> 55:40.100
 And you also mentioned that Bitcoin is the mechanism of a peaceful revolution.

55:40.100 --> 55:45.180
 So it's a way to resist authoritarianism in a peaceful way.

55:45.180 --> 55:54.140
 It's ultimately, you know, you mentioned sort of politics, information, and money.

55:54.140 --> 55:57.780
 It seems like in the space of money, this is one of the peaceful mechanisms.

55:57.780 --> 55:59.780
 It's a way to opt out.

55:59.780 --> 56:03.780
 You can opt out peacefully from the system.

56:03.780 --> 56:06.420
 And yeah, it's beautiful, it's beautiful.

56:06.420 --> 56:12.460
 So Bitcoin is currently by far the most popular sort of dominant cryptocurrency.

56:12.460 --> 56:17.660
 That said, and I look forward to your letters, Bitcoin maximalists.

56:17.660 --> 56:23.340
 That said, you know, Internet Explorer was the most popular browser for quite a long

56:23.340 --> 56:24.340
 time.

56:24.340 --> 56:31.100
 And then other browsers came along that out competed it like Chrome, Firefox, People's

56:31.100 --> 56:32.100
 Checkout Brave.

56:32.100 --> 56:33.980
 It's a great browser.

56:33.980 --> 56:36.500
 I think it's my favorite browser at this point.

56:36.500 --> 56:38.060
 Anyway, so why Bitcoin?

56:38.060 --> 56:39.860
 Why not another cryptocurrency?

56:39.860 --> 56:46.460
 If you look in the next 10, 20, 50, 100 years, do you think it's possible for another cryptocurrency

56:46.460 --> 56:53.480
 like Ethereum or something that it's not even here yet to overtake Bitcoin as a mechanism?

56:53.480 --> 56:57.020
 When you say overtake, what do you mean?

56:57.020 --> 56:58.020
 What do you mean overtake?

56:58.020 --> 56:59.020
 You mean number of users?

56:59.020 --> 57:01.500
 Do you mean a price per coin?

57:01.500 --> 57:05.980
 Yeah, the number of users, because we're talking about 1%, 2%.

57:05.980 --> 57:16.340
 And if we are serious about this being in the space of money as a way to give individuals

57:16.340 --> 57:22.700
 power, fight the centralized powers that use the money system and so on, how do we get

57:22.700 --> 57:29.060
 from 2% to 50%, right, to 60%, to 80%?

57:29.060 --> 57:35.900
 At that jump, is it obvious to you, not obvious, but do you think Bitcoin is the way to get

57:35.900 --> 57:42.620
 from 2% to 50% or are there going to be other cryptocurrencies that may emerge that get

57:42.620 --> 57:43.620
 us to 50%?

57:43.620 --> 57:44.620
 No.

57:44.620 --> 57:45.620
 I mean, Bitcoin is the innovation.

57:45.620 --> 57:48.700
 The innovation is in having the decentralized mint.

57:48.700 --> 57:51.380
 No one can change the monetary policy.

57:51.380 --> 57:53.260
 Everything else is downstream from there.

57:53.260 --> 57:55.620
 In Bitcoin, the mean would be 21 million.

57:55.620 --> 57:58.020
 There's never going to be any more than 21 million.

57:58.020 --> 58:02.460
 Every other cryptocurrency either has an inflationary policy, meaning there's going to continue

58:02.460 --> 58:06.920
 to be more and more of it over time, or its monetary policy can be changed by a small

58:06.920 --> 58:08.160
 group of people.

58:08.160 --> 58:12.020
 This is vividly on display in Ethereum, which is like the second largest and second most

58:12.020 --> 58:14.020
 robust cryptocurrency, right?

58:14.020 --> 58:18.580
 I've talked to senior Ethereum engineers over the last couple of weeks trying to figure

58:18.580 --> 58:22.020
 out what is the monetary policy of Ethereum?

58:22.020 --> 58:23.220
 No one can tell me.

58:23.220 --> 58:28.340
 No one knows how much ETH is going to be minted in 2022 and 2023 after they shift to proof

58:28.340 --> 58:29.900
 of stake.

58:29.900 --> 58:33.300
 I've seen estimates that range from 100,000 to 2 million.

58:33.300 --> 58:35.940
 So at the end of the day, you're going to be trusting a small group of people to make

58:35.940 --> 58:37.180
 those decisions.

58:37.180 --> 58:39.340
 That is what we are escaping with Bitcoin.

58:39.340 --> 58:43.740
 So all these other cryptocurrencies, they might have their use cases, virtually all

58:43.740 --> 58:44.740
 of them are not.

58:44.740 --> 58:48.400
 It's very important for people to know that if you take like the 4,500 cryptocurrencies

58:48.400 --> 58:52.980
 on CoinMarketCap, almost all of them are scams straight up.

58:52.980 --> 58:57.540
 Even the ones that have like noble intentions, I just don't think are going to add that much

58:57.540 --> 58:59.540
 value ultimately.

58:59.540 --> 59:04.660
 I think Bitcoin to me is the innovation and you know, that's because it has a monetary

59:04.660 --> 59:08.460
 policy and an issuance schedule that cannot be changed.

59:08.460 --> 59:09.660
 And that's what gets me so excited about it.

59:09.660 --> 59:12.220
 I mean, that's why it's such an important tool for human rights.

59:12.220 --> 59:17.380
 Yeah, it's interesting because when you grow from 2%, when you grow in the number of people

59:17.380 --> 59:25.300
 using it at the scale, they're using it, it's going to need to be resistant to governments

59:25.300 --> 59:27.660
 and institutions messing with it.

59:27.660 --> 59:33.940
 So it's interesting to see what kind of cryptocurrency would be resistant to that.

59:33.940 --> 59:35.980
 Obviously Dogecoin is going to win.

59:35.980 --> 59:36.980
 Let's be honest.

59:36.980 --> 59:43.700
 Well, I mean, look, the number two cryptocurrency in the world, probably by like how useful

59:43.700 --> 59:49.100
 it is to people is Tether, which is totally centralized, has blacklists.

59:49.100 --> 59:54.300
 So I'm not saying there won't be like new digital assets that are lumped into this category

59:54.300 --> 59:59.380
 that have usage, but they're not, they're not, it's not the same innovation as Bitcoin.

59:59.380 --> 1:00:03.540
 It's just sort of building on this idea of like a Euro dollar, maybe like a dollar that

1:00:03.540 --> 1:00:06.900
 is minted outside of the control of the US Federal Reserve, right?

1:00:06.900 --> 1:00:08.180
 It would be a Euro dollar.

1:00:08.180 --> 1:00:11.940
 So stable coins are kind of like Euro dollars just minted by private actors in a way, right?

1:00:11.940 --> 1:00:13.300
 But they're still tied to the dollar.

1:00:13.300 --> 1:00:14.780
 They're pegged to the dollar.

1:00:14.780 --> 1:00:16.740
 They're not escaping the system.

1:00:16.740 --> 1:00:18.580
 Escaping the system is Bitcoin.

1:00:18.580 --> 1:00:20.780
 We aren't reliant on the dollar.

1:00:20.780 --> 1:00:26.820
 We have our own, you know, full store value, medium of exchange, unit of account eventually.

1:00:26.820 --> 1:00:30.640
 And you know, the Bitcoin world will be denominated in different terms.

1:00:30.640 --> 1:00:32.660
 And I think everyone, everything else will be tied to it.

1:00:32.660 --> 1:00:33.820
 I really do.

1:00:33.820 --> 1:00:38.820
 It does feel currently like Bitcoin is like, like pirates or something like that.

1:00:38.820 --> 1:00:43.180
 And there's still like the central banks that are like the main navies of the, of the different

1:00:43.180 --> 1:00:44.180
 nations.

1:00:44.180 --> 1:00:45.180
 Yeah.

1:00:45.180 --> 1:00:46.480
 It's just this, if you talk about scale.

1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:51.680
 So there's going to be a moment if Bitcoin continues to grow in its impact, when governments

1:00:51.680 --> 1:00:56.760
 are going to seriously contend with, you know, what do we do with this?

1:00:56.760 --> 1:00:58.520
 Do you think about those moments?

1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:04.800
 Is Bitcoin, is the cryptocurrency world in general going to be able to withstand the

1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:11.260
 serious legal pushback from countries, from nations, especially authoritarian nations?

1:01:11.260 --> 1:01:12.260
 Yeah.

1:01:12.260 --> 1:01:13.260
 It's been interesting.

1:01:13.260 --> 1:01:15.820
 It's been 12 years, okay?

1:01:15.820 --> 1:01:20.420
 More than 12 years since Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin and they haven't been able

1:01:20.420 --> 1:01:21.420
 to stop it.

1:01:21.420 --> 1:01:22.420
 They have tried.

1:01:22.420 --> 1:01:23.580
 They have tried a lot.

1:01:23.580 --> 1:01:27.460
 I wrote a long essay for Quillette on this, like, like why haven't governments been able

1:01:27.460 --> 1:01:28.980
 to stop Bitcoin?

1:01:28.980 --> 1:01:33.260
 And my thesis is essentially that there's been like this mix of different kinds of technical,

1:01:33.260 --> 1:01:39.620
 social and economic and political incentives and disincentives that make it very difficult.

1:01:39.620 --> 1:01:44.380
 And I think to me, the best way to think about it is that Bitcoin is like a Trojan horse.

1:01:44.380 --> 1:01:48.720
 So just to actually tell that story just a little bit, because I think it's important

1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:53.940
 to understand the classical mythology tale, I find this very interesting.

1:01:53.940 --> 1:01:54.940
 Of the actual Trojan horse?

1:01:54.940 --> 1:01:55.940
 Of the actual Trojan horse.

1:01:55.940 --> 1:01:56.940
 Yeah.

1:01:56.940 --> 1:01:58.980
 Which was told in the Aeneid actually by Virgil, right?

1:01:58.980 --> 1:02:02.940
 And the idea was the Greeks had been like trying to take the city of Troy for like a

1:02:02.940 --> 1:02:06.580
 decade at these like impregnable walls and they couldn't do it.

1:02:06.580 --> 1:02:10.140
 And Ulysses and the rest of the Greek army were like, we don't know what to do.

1:02:10.140 --> 1:02:15.340
 So Minerva, the god of strategy and war, you know, kind of like they get this idea from

1:02:15.340 --> 1:02:20.340
 her, I guess, to actually try to use subterfuge and trickery to take over the city.

1:02:20.340 --> 1:02:23.420
 So the idea is to, and this was sort of hatched by Ulysses, right?

1:02:23.420 --> 1:02:27.500
 To put this horse together that would kind of be like a gift.

1:02:27.500 --> 1:02:31.540
 So the idea was the Greeks just like pretended to leave, right?

1:02:31.540 --> 1:02:32.540
 They deserted.

1:02:32.540 --> 1:02:36.060
 They left behind one soldier and this horse and the Trojans looked at it and they were

1:02:36.060 --> 1:02:37.700
 like, what's going on here?

1:02:37.700 --> 1:02:40.820
 And they brought in the soldier and the soldier's like, look, they left.

1:02:40.820 --> 1:02:43.660
 They're so sorry for all of the desecration and blood spill.

1:02:43.660 --> 1:02:44.740
 This is their gift to you.

1:02:44.740 --> 1:02:49.100
 It's, you know, honoring Minerva, you know, it's like this like, you know, trophy for

1:02:49.100 --> 1:02:50.380
 you guys.

1:02:50.380 --> 1:02:55.780
 And there were actually people inside Troy, Cassandra, a prophet, as well as Laocoon,

1:02:55.780 --> 1:02:58.220
 who was like a priest who said, no, no, no, this is obviously a trick.

1:02:58.220 --> 1:03:00.000
 This is obviously a trick.

1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:03.620
 But they were like dispatched and ignored because the horse was like, it was just like

1:03:03.620 --> 1:03:04.620
 so bad ass.

1:03:04.620 --> 1:03:07.540
 So the Trojans were like, I'm bringing it in the city.

1:03:07.540 --> 1:03:09.000
 So they brought it in themselves.

1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:10.000
 No blood spilled at all.

1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:11.000
 Right.

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.540
 In the middle of the night, of course, what you realize is the horse was packed with Greek

1:03:13.540 --> 1:03:16.920
 soldiers and they come out and they let the army in, which was like hiding behind an island.

1:03:16.920 --> 1:03:23.100
 So this idea that like something could be so attractive that you really can't say no,

1:03:23.100 --> 1:03:26.220
 even if you know what's inside of it, is at play in Bitcoin.

1:03:26.220 --> 1:03:29.500
 So like in Bitcoin has this number go up technology, right?

1:03:29.500 --> 1:03:33.840
 It is what we call it in sort of shorthand NGO, NGU, right?

1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:38.060
 But what people don't realize is that NGU is like the Trojan horse.

1:03:38.060 --> 1:03:41.260
 Inside the Trojan horse is FGU, Freedom Go Up technology.

1:03:41.260 --> 1:03:47.780
 So dictators and rogue regimes and corporations are going to buy, mine, tax, accumulate this

1:03:47.780 --> 1:03:51.620
 thing because it's the best performing financial asset in the world.

1:03:51.620 --> 1:03:56.220
 What they don't realize or they're going to have to ignore is that they're also aiding

1:03:56.220 --> 1:04:00.760
 and abetting this freedom technology, which allows individuals to be sovereign and eventually

1:04:00.760 --> 1:04:02.140
 erodes their power.

1:04:02.140 --> 1:04:05.980
 There's no question that rogue regimes and bad actors have already used and will continue

1:04:05.980 --> 1:04:06.980
 to use Bitcoin.

1:04:06.980 --> 1:04:11.500
 The thing is when you think about a North Korea or a Venezuela and that government instructs

1:04:11.500 --> 1:04:16.780
 some of its bureaucrats and cronies and officials to start stealing Bitcoin or accumulating

1:04:16.780 --> 1:04:21.500
 it or whatever for short term gain to get around sanctions and use it to buy dollars

1:04:21.500 --> 1:04:22.540
 or something like that, right?

1:04:22.540 --> 1:04:23.700
 Which they can't get normally.

1:04:23.700 --> 1:04:24.700
 Well, guess what?

1:04:24.700 --> 1:04:28.420
 All those people who the regime has instructed to like figure this thing out and use it,

1:04:28.420 --> 1:04:31.480
 they're all going to realize, oh my God, this is money the government doesn't control.

1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:32.860
 And it's going to spread like a virus.

1:04:32.860 --> 1:04:33.860
 Okay?

1:04:33.860 --> 1:04:36.820
 So this is like the idea of the Trojan horse allegory, why I think it's so important and

1:04:36.820 --> 1:04:38.460
 powerful with Bitcoin.

1:04:38.460 --> 1:04:43.440
 All the people talking about Bitcoin today on TV, they don't care about freedom and privacy.

1:04:43.440 --> 1:04:44.820
 They just care about number go up.

1:04:44.820 --> 1:04:47.300
 But what they don't realize is what's concealed within.

1:04:47.300 --> 1:04:50.120
 And that's very, very powerful to me.

1:04:50.120 --> 1:04:54.420
 So the people talking about Bitcoin on TV are maybe investor types.

1:04:54.420 --> 1:04:58.220
 Yeah, professional investors, corporations and soon governments.

1:04:58.220 --> 1:05:04.620
 I mean, you just had today this morning on CNBC, the leader of the Republican leader

1:05:04.620 --> 1:05:08.740
 of the House of Representatives, a congressman saying, like, we need to be pro Bitcoin as

1:05:08.740 --> 1:05:09.740
 a country.

1:05:09.740 --> 1:05:13.020
 And the other day, Peter Thiel had a very interesting comment where he was basically

1:05:13.020 --> 1:05:16.020
 like, let's not fall behind China in this race.

1:05:16.020 --> 1:05:22.540
 So you have influential people in our government, like sort of posturing for this, like, you

1:05:22.540 --> 1:05:25.140
 know, Bitcoin race that's going to happen in the next 10 years.

1:05:25.140 --> 1:05:26.580
 You're going to see this.

1:05:26.580 --> 1:05:28.860
 You're going to compete to stack Bitcoin.

1:05:28.860 --> 1:05:29.860
 Absolutely.

1:05:29.860 --> 1:05:34.980
 So you believe the the thing that's shiny and sexy, like the Trojan horse, the number

1:05:34.980 --> 1:05:35.980
 go up.

1:05:35.980 --> 1:05:38.460
 It's too hard to ignore.

1:05:38.460 --> 1:05:44.960
 And for it to do to define that a little further as meaning it does seem like the more people

1:05:44.960 --> 1:05:48.240
 get excited and start using Bitcoin, the more its value grows.

1:05:48.240 --> 1:05:49.820
 So it's just a good feedback loop.

1:05:49.820 --> 1:05:51.300
 Yeah, it's a feedback loop.

1:05:51.300 --> 1:05:56.780
 And then the reason you're excited about it, especially is that F.G.

1:05:56.780 --> 1:05:57.780
 Freedom go up.

1:05:57.780 --> 1:06:03.740
 Freedom go up, which is it ultimately gives power to the individuals to so decentralize

1:06:03.740 --> 1:06:04.740
 the entire system.

1:06:04.740 --> 1:06:08.540
 Yeah, I mean, like when Tesla stacks Bitcoin, they're just doing that as self interest.

1:06:08.540 --> 1:06:10.420
 They think it's going to be a good inflation hedge.

1:06:10.420 --> 1:06:11.420
 Fine.

1:06:11.420 --> 1:06:14.660
 But what they maybe don't care about, don't realize or they don't need to care.

1:06:14.660 --> 1:06:19.580
 I mean, Bitcoin's power is it like co ops people into promoting a freedom tool, even

1:06:19.580 --> 1:06:22.820
 if they don't care about or even if they hate freedom, doesn't matter.

1:06:22.820 --> 1:06:27.060
 So when Tesla stacks Bitcoin and the price goes up and more interest goes up and more

1:06:27.060 --> 1:06:31.620
 people around the world are like, wow, Bitcoin, then more people get involved again.

1:06:31.620 --> 1:06:36.500
 More adoption, more price, more developers, better user interface, more privacy tools,

1:06:36.500 --> 1:06:38.140
 more mining, more network security.

1:06:38.140 --> 1:06:42.620
 It's just this like positive feedback loop that continues to grow and it will grow intensely

1:06:42.620 --> 1:06:45.380
 in the next decade as we go through the adoption cycle.

1:06:45.380 --> 1:06:48.740
 And the reason why I'm so excited about this is the human rights world, again, to get back

1:06:48.740 --> 1:06:54.540
 to our previous conversation, is very hard to find people who have, you know, the empathy

1:06:54.540 --> 1:06:58.580
 or the altruism to actually make a difference abroad in places like China or Saudi Arabia

1:06:58.580 --> 1:07:00.120
 or North Korea.

1:07:00.120 --> 1:07:04.780
 People are very quick to just like, they'll just quickly toss off the pretty words that

1:07:04.780 --> 1:07:07.780
 they care about human rights as soon as profits come into play.

1:07:07.780 --> 1:07:09.940
 So there's no alignment of incentives, right?

1:07:09.940 --> 1:07:13.140
 The reason why Bitcoin is so powerful is that it aligns the incentives.

1:07:13.140 --> 1:07:16.020
 All of a sudden, they can be as greedy as they want.

1:07:16.020 --> 1:07:18.500
 They are being forced to promote a freedom tool.

1:07:18.500 --> 1:07:21.680
 This I've never seen before and it makes me, it gives me a lot of like excitement.

1:07:21.680 --> 1:07:25.940
 It's very refreshing because we've been laboring in the human rights space, you have to like

1:07:25.940 --> 1:07:29.620
 raise money and it's all like nonprofit work and you're like begging for people to make

1:07:29.620 --> 1:07:31.200
 a difference for you.

1:07:31.200 --> 1:07:36.060
 Here you have this like incredible asset which people will accumulate out of self preservation,

1:07:36.060 --> 1:07:40.580
 self interest and greed, and yet it will strengthen the power of the individual.

1:07:40.580 --> 1:07:42.620
 That is what we need to fight, big brother.

1:07:42.620 --> 1:07:46.820
 That's what we need to fight, like what I'm scared is happening in China, like this growing

1:07:46.820 --> 1:07:50.540
 authoritarian state which is powered by big data analysis.

1:07:50.540 --> 1:07:56.580
 This is our way to fight back and it runs on this like really interesting engine again

1:07:56.580 --> 1:08:00.780
 that like takes advantage of our base nature as humans and I know that it sounds terrible

1:08:00.780 --> 1:08:07.200
 for me to say this, but I mean, ultimately we are self interested and it is hard to get

1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:10.400
 people to care about others living a thousand miles away.

1:08:10.400 --> 1:08:14.320
 We are kind of localized in our empathy.

1:08:14.320 --> 1:08:19.300
 Being as someone who works to help people who live in like a hundred different countries,

1:08:19.300 --> 1:08:23.260
 it's very difficult to get Americans to care about what's happening in Belarus or in Kashmir.

1:08:23.260 --> 1:08:24.260
 It just is.

1:08:24.260 --> 1:08:25.260
 But guess what?

1:08:25.260 --> 1:08:29.580
 They're going to definitely care about Bitcoin because they want to see their net worth go

1:08:29.580 --> 1:08:31.980
 up, they want to do better for their family, et cetera.

1:08:31.980 --> 1:08:36.060
 They're going to get into this thing and it's really going to like make that powerful tool

1:08:36.060 --> 1:08:37.940
 for everyone else who's using it.

1:08:37.940 --> 1:08:41.820
 So this interplay dynamic is fascinating to me.

1:08:41.820 --> 1:08:50.980
 Yeah, I have to, I'm somebody who doesn't like the corrupting effects of greed, but

1:08:50.980 --> 1:08:52.460
 it is also human nature.

1:08:52.460 --> 1:08:55.860
 Yeah, I don't like it either, but we have to be realists.

1:08:55.860 --> 1:09:00.620
 You have to acknowledge it and then maybe use it for your advantage.

1:09:00.620 --> 1:09:02.160
 And it's not just Bitcoin itself.

1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:06.060
 Like exchanges today are adopting something called lightning network, which is a way to

1:09:06.060 --> 1:09:08.020
 scale Bitcoin on a second layer.

1:09:08.020 --> 1:09:11.460
 Much like we had gold bars, which we scaled with paper money and then we had visa credit

1:09:11.460 --> 1:09:16.620
 cards, which were a way of scaling the paper notes, Bitcoin scales through lightning network.

1:09:16.620 --> 1:09:20.580
 It's a private instant globally final settlement network.

1:09:20.580 --> 1:09:22.500
 It's something you all should check out.

1:09:22.500 --> 1:09:24.440
 It's very, very interesting.

1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:27.860
 The exchanges aren't adopting lightning for its privacy benefits.

1:09:27.860 --> 1:09:31.860
 Like lightning operates off the chain, meaning surveillance companies can't see, they can't

1:09:31.860 --> 1:09:35.540
 do chain analysis on lightning because it's on an onion routed second layer kind of that

1:09:35.540 --> 1:09:38.660
 works kind of like the Tor project.

1:09:38.660 --> 1:09:41.020
 The exchanges don't care about privacy.

1:09:41.020 --> 1:09:43.300
 They're doing it because it reduces fees.

1:09:43.300 --> 1:09:45.100
 Lightning is cheaper and faster.

1:09:45.100 --> 1:09:48.380
 So again, we have this really interesting alignment of incentives where like the freedom

1:09:48.380 --> 1:09:52.260
 tech is being promoted by people who don't, I don't, it doesn't matter what their incentives

1:09:52.260 --> 1:09:53.260
 are.

1:09:53.260 --> 1:09:55.440
 I could care less if they were altruistic or not.

1:09:55.440 --> 1:09:58.780
 And I think this is, and you're going to maybe see this even in the future.

1:09:58.780 --> 1:10:01.820
 There's more things coming in Bitcoin down the pike.

1:10:01.820 --> 1:10:04.320
 Lightning was enabled by an upgrade called Segwit, right?

1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:08.380
 Which took place a few years ago, which was the culmination of the block size conflict.

1:10:08.380 --> 1:10:12.700
 There's another thing coming up called cross input signature aggregation, which may, if

1:10:12.700 --> 1:10:18.520
 it takes effect in the next few years, it may compel exchanges to collaboratively spend

1:10:18.520 --> 1:10:23.260
 all their Bitcoin together in a way that really protects our privacy and fights surveillance.

1:10:23.260 --> 1:10:25.200
 But they're not going to do it for moral reasons.

1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:27.420
 They're going to do it because it's going to save them money and improve their bottom

1:10:27.420 --> 1:10:28.420
 line.

1:10:28.420 --> 1:10:31.860
 Can you speak to that kind of collaborative so that you can have multiple parties in a

1:10:31.860 --> 1:10:33.660
 single transaction kind of thing?

1:10:33.660 --> 1:10:34.660
 Yeah.

1:10:34.660 --> 1:10:35.660
 Like you could do that today.

1:10:35.660 --> 1:10:36.660
 Absolutely.

1:10:36.660 --> 1:10:38.220
 It's called the CoinJoin, for example.

1:10:38.220 --> 1:10:40.100
 But right now it's more expensive to CoinJoin in Bitcoin.

1:10:40.100 --> 1:10:42.420
 You have to pay a premium for your privacy.

1:10:42.420 --> 1:10:45.900
 This would flip that on its head and would basically say, if you have one transaction,

1:10:45.900 --> 1:10:48.500
 hey, pile them all in, have as many parties as you want.

1:10:48.500 --> 1:10:52.140
 The more parties you get in, the cheaper it's going to be per party.

1:10:52.140 --> 1:10:55.140
 And that's not possible in Bitcoin today, but it might be in the future.

1:10:55.140 --> 1:11:00.540
 But again, the beauty in Bitcoin are these ways that it just aligns human incentives

1:11:00.540 --> 1:11:08.420
 and it aligns our most base desires and needs and realities with freedom and privacy.

1:11:08.420 --> 1:11:09.780
 That I've never seen before.

1:11:09.780 --> 1:11:12.220
 And that's why I think it's so interesting.

1:11:12.220 --> 1:11:21.460
 So somebody like Eric Weinstein actually spoke to this, the idea of blockchain in general.

1:11:21.460 --> 1:11:27.660
 From a 10,000 foot view, the blockchain is a centralized place to keep the record of

1:11:27.660 --> 1:11:34.380
 everything that ever happened and does that concern you from a privacy perspective, from

1:11:34.380 --> 1:11:41.500
 a control perspective, even though it's managed, especially given the low frequency of transaction

1:11:41.500 --> 1:11:48.700
 for Bitcoin, you can have a lot of small computers across the globe contain the entirety set

1:11:48.700 --> 1:11:52.380
 of transactions, all of those kinds of features.

1:11:52.380 --> 1:11:57.900
 Does that concern you that there's one place where everything is made public in terms of

1:11:57.900 --> 1:11:59.660
 everything that ever happened?

1:11:59.660 --> 1:12:00.660
 No.

1:12:00.660 --> 1:12:02.380
 And I'll give you two reasons.

1:12:02.380 --> 1:12:07.180
 Number one, the Bitcoin blockchain is ultimately a settlement layer.

1:12:07.180 --> 1:12:10.520
 It's kind of like something like Fedwire in the United States.

1:12:10.520 --> 1:12:14.100
 It's a way for like institutions to settle with each other.

1:12:14.100 --> 1:12:17.220
 That's what I think it's going to be like in 20, 30 years from now.

1:12:17.220 --> 1:12:20.800
 The average person is never going to touch the Bitcoin blockchain probably.

1:12:20.800 --> 1:12:24.980
 They're going to use things like lightning or unfortunately, they may use Bitcoin banks,

1:12:24.980 --> 1:12:29.500
 but they'll either use custodians or they'll use second layer noncustodial solutions to

1:12:29.500 --> 1:12:30.500
 interact.

1:12:30.500 --> 1:12:32.280
 The main chain is going to get very expensive.

1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:35.940
 It's going to be hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars or even more if the dollar

1:12:35.940 --> 1:12:39.940
 starts to weaken to make a transaction on the main chain.

1:12:39.940 --> 1:12:44.580
 And that will be reserved for like very large transactions or transactions that need final

1:12:44.580 --> 1:12:48.100
 final settlement, et cetera, et cetera.

1:12:48.100 --> 1:12:53.300
 And I think that that's fine and that's okay.

1:12:53.300 --> 1:12:59.940
 And it's very important that that ledger, that settlement layer be kept by thousands

1:12:59.940 --> 1:13:01.380
 of people around the world.

1:13:01.380 --> 1:13:03.220
 The Bitcoin blockchain is not centralized.

1:13:03.220 --> 1:13:04.220
 It is decentralized.

1:13:04.220 --> 1:13:06.820
 It is run by people like me who run a node at home.

1:13:06.820 --> 1:13:08.140
 I run a personal server.

1:13:08.140 --> 1:13:10.740
 I run the Bitcoin blockchain, no one else.

1:13:10.740 --> 1:13:11.740
 You run it.

1:13:11.740 --> 1:13:12.740
 That person runs it.

1:13:12.740 --> 1:13:13.740
 There's no one in charge.

1:13:13.740 --> 1:13:14.740
 Well, you have a full node?

1:13:14.740 --> 1:13:15.740
 Yeah.

1:13:15.740 --> 1:13:16.740
 I run a full node.

1:13:16.740 --> 1:13:17.740
 It's great.

1:13:17.740 --> 1:13:18.740
 That's great, man.

1:13:18.740 --> 1:13:22.260
 You run it and that way you can be sovereign over all of your usage, right?

1:13:22.260 --> 1:13:26.100
 And you can run it on a Raspberry Pi with less than 150 bucks of equipment.

1:13:26.100 --> 1:13:30.600
 And that's so important because again, there is no Amazon web service vulnerability here.

1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:31.600
 That is a problem.

1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:32.600
 And I agree with you.

1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:33.600
 We're trending in a bad direction.

1:13:33.600 --> 1:13:37.700
 We're like, the government could just turn off a big important website or a news source.

1:13:37.700 --> 1:13:41.260
 Well, they can't turn off Bitcoin because it doesn't live on AWS, it lives with us.

1:13:41.260 --> 1:13:42.260
 We are Bitcoin.

1:13:42.260 --> 1:13:45.300
 And I think that that's very, very powerful.

1:13:45.300 --> 1:13:51.180
 And then you can have something like a lightning network where you can escape some of the constraints

1:13:51.180 --> 1:13:56.340
 of the blockchain, depending on your needs of the privacy and all those kinds of things.

1:13:56.340 --> 1:13:59.200
 Everything's an engineering trade off, but yeah, you can trade off some of the assurances

1:13:59.200 --> 1:14:03.760
 of the base layer to go into lightning, for example, and there you can get more speed

1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:04.760
 and more privacy.

1:14:04.760 --> 1:14:09.740
 And the things that Bitcoin lacks, speed and privacy, for example, you can get on these

1:14:09.740 --> 1:14:10.740
 second layers.

1:14:10.740 --> 1:14:14.620
 So there's all kinds of cool engineering things that people are coming up with.

1:14:14.620 --> 1:14:19.260
 But I also want to say anyone who says the blockchain, like that's a red flag for that

1:14:19.260 --> 1:14:21.260
 person doesn't really know what they're talking about.

1:14:21.260 --> 1:14:25.440
 Like Satoshi didn't use the blockchain in the white paper.

1:14:25.440 --> 1:14:30.360
 Blockchain was a marketing term that people came up with later to try and do this thing

1:14:30.360 --> 1:14:35.940
 that was kind of like it peaked in 2015 and it continues to be an issue today of it's

1:14:35.940 --> 1:14:37.780
 blockchain not Bitcoin.

1:14:37.780 --> 1:14:43.100
 And that was like a very corporate kind of social attack on Bitcoin to say we could take

1:14:43.100 --> 1:14:47.500
 this ledger part of this radical thing that's for criminals and all these bad people, but

1:14:47.500 --> 1:14:51.060
 we could take one part of it out and we could bring it over here and we could make it safe

1:14:51.060 --> 1:14:52.980
 for everybody.

1:14:52.980 --> 1:14:57.020
 The real McCoy's Bitcoin, I mean, Satoshi referred to it as the time chain.

1:14:57.020 --> 1:15:00.820
 I mean, really what they're talking about is just these blocks that are connected chronologically

1:15:00.820 --> 1:15:01.820
 of transactions.

1:15:01.820 --> 1:15:03.620
 It's really not that exciting.

1:15:03.620 --> 1:15:08.260
 The exciting part of Bitcoin is the proof of work where the transaction processing is

1:15:08.260 --> 1:15:13.980
 done by mining and by energy and by real world expenditures instead of like, you know, some

1:15:13.980 --> 1:15:15.860
 central ledger.

1:15:15.860 --> 1:15:21.180
 And you know, when you remove the blockchain from Bitcoin, it's not very, to me, it's just

1:15:21.180 --> 1:15:22.180
 not that interesting.

1:15:22.180 --> 1:15:26.900
 I don't know, to me, blockchain or time chain, whatever, as it philosophically is a pretty

1:15:26.900 --> 1:15:27.900
 beautiful idea.

1:15:27.900 --> 1:15:33.780
 I mean, it's pretty simple, but it's nevertheless as beautiful from a big database person.

1:15:33.780 --> 1:15:39.620
 It's an interesting way to store information that, especially that's totally publicly accessible.

1:15:39.620 --> 1:15:47.420
 It's I know that to Bitcoin proof of work is the fundamental idea, but to cryptocurrency

1:15:47.420 --> 1:15:51.100
 and digital money in general and to money, the blockchain is a really interesting idea

1:15:51.100 --> 1:15:52.100
 to me.

1:15:52.100 --> 1:15:55.500
 The way I think about it is it's kind of, you know, physics.

1:15:55.500 --> 1:16:00.620
 And I like that there's a place that you can rely on that's very difficult to mess with.

1:16:00.620 --> 1:16:04.020
 What it's not though, like it's outside of maybe Ethereum.

1:16:04.020 --> 1:16:06.220
 Every other blockchain is easy to mess with.

1:16:06.220 --> 1:16:10.140
 So you're saying that proof of work is what makes it hard to mess with.

1:16:10.140 --> 1:16:11.140
 Absolutely.

1:16:11.140 --> 1:16:12.140
 Proof of work is the key.

1:16:12.140 --> 1:16:13.140
 Right.

1:16:13.140 --> 1:16:14.140
 And Ethereum is about to leave proof of work.

1:16:14.140 --> 1:16:19.180
 So it's about to go to proof of stake, which is literally the existing system where a small

1:16:19.180 --> 1:16:21.140
 group of people get to decide the monetary policy.

1:16:21.140 --> 1:16:22.140
 Yeah.

1:16:22.140 --> 1:16:25.780
 Reputation has a lot of value there and that you could be, it could be manipulated.

1:16:25.780 --> 1:16:29.080
 I may sound brutal, but I'm coming at it from a political science perspective.

1:16:29.080 --> 1:16:31.900
 For me, it's all about freedom versus dictatorship.

1:16:31.900 --> 1:16:37.140
 And that's why I find it so compelling that regardless of how much power or might or how

1:16:37.140 --> 1:16:41.020
 many armies you have, you can't change the rules of Bitcoin.

1:16:41.020 --> 1:16:45.620
 If you're wrong about Bitcoin, what would that look like?

1:16:45.620 --> 1:16:52.620
 What kind of thing that in 10, 20 years that you, you're not wrong.

1:16:52.620 --> 1:16:53.620
 Right.

1:16:53.620 --> 1:16:54.780
 It doesn't pan out.

1:16:54.780 --> 1:16:58.900
 It doesn't pan out, but other things that actually make you feel good about all the

1:16:58.900 --> 1:17:03.160
 hard work you've done do pan out, something you haven't expected.

1:17:03.160 --> 1:17:04.340
 What might that be?

1:17:04.340 --> 1:17:08.560
 Well, as we've talked about, my career started in human rights and in promoting individual

1:17:08.560 --> 1:17:10.860
 freedom and fighting authoritarianism.

1:17:10.860 --> 1:17:15.160
 That fight will continue on no matter what happens with Bitcoin.

1:17:15.160 --> 1:17:20.380
 I think it would be a massive failure and a tragedy if this project like didn't work.

1:17:20.380 --> 1:17:21.380
 The Bitcoin project.

1:17:21.380 --> 1:17:22.380
 Yes.

1:17:22.380 --> 1:17:24.760
 If the Bitcoin project didn't work, we would, it would, honestly, it's one of the only

1:17:24.760 --> 1:17:29.260
 things that gives me hope because it is an effective way to push back against the creeping

1:17:29.260 --> 1:17:31.600
 centralized control.

1:17:31.600 --> 1:17:35.180
 If for whatever reason, and I can't really see, one of the reasons I'm so into it is

1:17:35.180 --> 1:17:37.300
 I can't really see how it's not going to work.

1:17:37.300 --> 1:17:41.380
 Again, I think the Trojan horse allegory is too powerful.

1:17:41.380 --> 1:17:45.120
 These big centralized actors are going to be too greedy and they're going to want some

1:17:45.120 --> 1:17:46.120
 as opposed to banning it.

1:17:46.120 --> 1:17:47.860
 It's way easier for them to buy it than to ban it.

1:17:47.860 --> 1:17:49.380
 I think that's just what's going to happen.

1:17:49.380 --> 1:17:52.900
 But if, but if whatever, for whatever reason it failed, I would have very little hope left

1:17:52.900 --> 1:17:57.380
 because really, I mean, the Chinese model of like centralizing all of your data and

1:17:57.380 --> 1:18:03.900
 controlling it, I mean, ultimately is, is a very, very powerful sort of like arch force.

1:18:03.900 --> 1:18:09.220
 And I would be concerned that that would be all of our, of our sort of destiny.

1:18:09.220 --> 1:18:12.860
 I do have to sort of push back at a style of communication and you, you're not doing

1:18:12.860 --> 1:18:13.860
 it today.

1:18:13.860 --> 1:18:17.500
 You're doing, you're being exceptionally eloquent and arguing these ideas.

1:18:17.500 --> 1:18:23.900
 But me, especially just from studying history and being very skeptical from growing up in

1:18:23.900 --> 1:18:31.860
 the Soviet Union, I'm very skeptical and cautious when I see a community of people being very

1:18:31.860 --> 1:18:34.900
 sure of an idea.

1:18:34.900 --> 1:18:36.660
 Doesn't matter what that idea is.

1:18:36.660 --> 1:18:40.180
 And there's a huge amount of certainty around Bitcoin.

1:18:40.180 --> 1:18:43.740
 Part of it is an important feature because you, it's number go up.

1:18:43.740 --> 1:18:45.740
 So far.

1:18:45.740 --> 1:18:53.580
 Number go up is a really important part of the mechanism to make sure that it, it grows

1:18:53.580 --> 1:18:57.980
 in impact, network effects, because I mean, it's really important to get excited about

1:18:57.980 --> 1:19:01.420
 idea for take hold, that's the way human nature works and so on.

1:19:01.420 --> 1:19:10.660
 But I also get, even something that you mentioned that, you know, others may not, you know,

1:19:10.660 --> 1:19:15.820
 if you mentioned blockchain, you're sensitive to the attacks that have been, that have been

1:19:15.820 --> 1:19:18.620
 mounted or the word blockchain have been used.

1:19:18.620 --> 1:19:19.620
 People have been fooled.

1:19:19.620 --> 1:19:23.940
 I mean, like people in the humanitarian sector have been fooled into thinking that some centralized

1:19:23.940 --> 1:19:27.540
 blockchain project is going to help some refugee all collapsed.

1:19:27.540 --> 1:19:31.700
 There's a huge, it makes me sad that there's a huge number of scams.

1:19:31.700 --> 1:19:35.580
 Like you know what makes me really sad and just a tiny little tangent.

1:19:35.580 --> 1:19:39.220
 There's been recently, I guess with the growing platform or something, there's been a bunch

1:19:39.220 --> 1:19:42.060
 of fake Lex Friedman accounts.

1:19:42.060 --> 1:19:43.060
 Yeah.

1:19:43.060 --> 1:19:49.420
 And have a million, but not only do they do stupid stuff, but they've been messaging people

1:19:49.420 --> 1:19:57.820
 like on LinkedIn and people write to me and they're saying like, I think it gets people.

1:19:57.820 --> 1:19:59.220
 I think they click on stuff.

1:19:59.220 --> 1:20:01.100
 I think they were not sure.

1:20:01.100 --> 1:20:10.340
 And it makes me think like, people are gullible or not gullible, but like, they're just like

1:20:10.340 --> 1:20:12.860
 I am, which is they're like hopeful about the world.

1:20:12.860 --> 1:20:16.340
 They're optimistic about the world, naive about the evil that's out there.

1:20:16.340 --> 1:20:17.740
 This is what goes wrong with Bitcoin.

1:20:17.740 --> 1:20:19.780
 And I've seen it.

1:20:19.780 --> 1:20:22.980
 People fall for these like, I mean, like in these different countries, I'm trying to like

1:20:22.980 --> 1:20:27.620
 talk to different people about Bitcoin and like the amount of like MLM schemes, pyramid

1:20:27.620 --> 1:20:31.300
 schemes, Ponzi schemes, there are just so many of them.

1:20:31.300 --> 1:20:32.420
 And there's plenty here too.

1:20:32.420 --> 1:20:37.220
 But like in Zimbabwe, I was talking to this guy who is a reporter who studies the effects

1:20:37.220 --> 1:20:40.100
 like the foreign currency exchange markets.

1:20:40.100 --> 1:20:43.060
 He's just saying one of the main reasons people don't want to get into Bitcoin is because

1:20:43.060 --> 1:20:45.700
 they've been scammed so hard by all these other things.

1:20:45.700 --> 1:20:49.240
 So I would say that that's one way it could go wrong is that like people just continue

1:20:49.240 --> 1:20:54.500
 to be like afraid of it because of things that are like that in the past.

1:20:54.500 --> 1:20:59.700
 So that not, it's not just the volatility, it's just the, you know, yeah, having like

1:20:59.700 --> 1:21:02.980
 If you think it's a pyramid scheme, you're not going to want to get involved.

1:21:02.980 --> 1:21:09.240
 And in some sense, if I were to speak to the Bitcoin Maximus community is to maybe ease

1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:14.060
 up on the certainty because that gives me the signal that it's a scam, to be honest.

1:21:14.060 --> 1:21:23.060
 So whenever somebody, whenever there's a lot of people being cultishly excited about something,

1:21:23.060 --> 1:21:24.700
 I start being very skeptical.

1:21:24.700 --> 1:21:29.260
 It's like, you know, I used to like Green Day before they became really popular.

1:21:29.260 --> 1:21:32.540
 And then the moment they became really popular, I'm like, I don't know, he started wearing

1:21:32.540 --> 1:21:35.220
 mascara and I was like, I don't like him anymore.

1:21:35.220 --> 1:21:41.940
 So I'm very skeptical about evangelists of an idea because I think Bitcoin on its own

1:21:41.940 --> 1:21:44.220
 is just a powerful idea that stands.

1:21:44.220 --> 1:21:49.120
 But I also understand that in a world of a lot of competing ideas where there's a lot

1:21:49.120 --> 1:21:54.780
 of scams and a lot of money to be made through those scams that you have to be, that you

1:21:54.780 --> 1:21:59.500
 have to be innovative in the kind of mechanisms you use to break through the scam, the ocean

1:21:59.500 --> 1:22:00.500
 of scams.

1:22:00.500 --> 1:22:05.380
 I took this personality test and I'm a 99 skepticism.

1:22:05.380 --> 1:22:12.140
 So I was first, sadly, cause I was first introduced to Bitcoin in 2013 and I was like, ah, whatever.

1:22:12.140 --> 1:22:16.220
 And it took me four years to actually get into it, to go down the rabbit hole.

1:22:16.220 --> 1:22:20.900
 I didn't really start to grasp it and start getting excited about it until 2017.

1:22:20.900 --> 1:22:25.020
 So I was regrettably very, very skeptical for a long time.

1:22:25.020 --> 1:22:26.740
 And I just thought it was like, whatever.

1:22:26.740 --> 1:22:28.340
 So I appreciate that.

1:22:28.340 --> 1:22:30.340
 And you should be skeptical.

1:22:30.340 --> 1:22:34.260
 But ultimately you got to believe in things like I believe in democracy, I believe it's

1:22:34.260 --> 1:22:35.260
 good for people.

1:22:35.260 --> 1:22:36.620
 I believe it's better than tyranny.

1:22:36.620 --> 1:22:37.620
 I believe in the internet.

1:22:37.620 --> 1:22:41.300
 I know that we've had issues with centralization of the internet, but I still believe it's

1:22:41.300 --> 1:22:44.620
 better to be connected than to have bridges between us.

1:22:44.620 --> 1:22:45.860
 And I believe in Bitcoin.

1:22:45.860 --> 1:22:52.020
 And to me, it's like a very similar progressive force that we're encountering.

1:22:52.020 --> 1:22:57.620
 But yeah, be skeptical, nothing will befall you.

1:22:57.620 --> 1:22:59.860
 That's bad if you're like cautious and skeptical.

1:22:59.860 --> 1:23:03.020
 That's like a good mentality to have.

1:23:03.020 --> 1:23:09.060
 One thing we haven't talked about all the violations of the human rights that authoritarian

1:23:09.060 --> 1:23:12.240
 regimes do.

1:23:12.240 --> 1:23:20.020
 There's a, not a positive, but there is a, you mentioned that nationalism is a drug.

1:23:20.020 --> 1:23:26.100
 There's something beautiful about loving your country, having pride in your country, loving

1:23:26.100 --> 1:23:30.340
 the, there's a feeling of belonging.

1:23:30.340 --> 1:23:33.940
 It could be country, it could be tribe, it could be family.

1:23:33.940 --> 1:23:35.180
 That's really powerful.

1:23:35.180 --> 1:23:37.560
 And that speaks to human nature as well.

1:23:37.560 --> 1:23:40.660
 And that can sometimes overpower everything else.

1:23:40.660 --> 1:23:47.500
 Patriotism, and you know, sometimes it can be seen when you study history, when you look

1:23:47.500 --> 1:23:55.380
 at Stalinist, the Soviet Union, or you can even look at Hitler and Nazi Germany, we tend

1:23:55.380 --> 1:23:58.620
 to paint patriotism in a negative light.

1:23:58.620 --> 1:24:02.060
 And then maybe when we look at the United States, but even here in the United States,

1:24:02.060 --> 1:24:08.420
 people often paint patriotism in a bad light, you know, every time I say I love America,

1:24:08.420 --> 1:24:12.320
 also as an immigrant, I love this country.

1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:19.340
 It's funny how that's taken as a political statement that, you know, people, I guess

1:24:19.340 --> 1:24:23.140
 on the right has been, have been more active in saying that they love the country and people

1:24:23.140 --> 1:24:30.580
 on the left have not sort of, it's almost become a weird slogan as opposed to a statement

1:24:30.580 --> 1:24:31.980
 of just love.

1:24:31.980 --> 1:24:36.740
 And I understand that patriotism can be a slippery slope into letting your government,

1:24:36.740 --> 1:24:41.780
 I mean, it's exactly what you're saying, the value of freedom of speech is you hold your

1:24:41.780 --> 1:24:44.660
 government to account for all the ways they mess up.

1:24:44.660 --> 1:24:47.300
 I mean, look, you have patriotism and then you have jingoism, right?

1:24:47.300 --> 1:24:49.940
 It's very important that we stay on the patriotic side.

1:24:49.940 --> 1:24:54.180
 Like as an American, I'm very patriotic in terms of, I love the values that this country

1:24:54.180 --> 1:24:56.260
 was founded on if you read the Bill of Rights.

1:24:56.260 --> 1:25:00.620
 And I love the fact that it was just flexible enough that we were able to change it to grant,

1:25:00.620 --> 1:25:03.180
 or at least to try to grant all people the same rights.

1:25:03.180 --> 1:25:05.180
 It was not the original plan of the founders, right?

1:25:05.180 --> 1:25:06.580
 It had to be changed.

1:25:06.580 --> 1:25:15.220
 But since then we've remained, those laws have remained and they're very good.

1:25:15.220 --> 1:25:16.340
 And I'm very proud of that.

1:25:16.340 --> 1:25:20.620
 What I'm not proud of is the jingoistic part of our country where we invade other countries

1:25:20.620 --> 1:25:21.620
 and bomb other countries.

1:25:21.620 --> 1:25:23.340
 I'm not proud of our prison system.

1:25:23.340 --> 1:25:25.260
 I think it's a huge stain on our nation.

1:25:25.260 --> 1:25:26.640
 I'm not proud of a lot of things.

1:25:26.640 --> 1:25:31.060
 So I think you can be patriotic, but you can be critical of your country.

1:25:31.060 --> 1:25:35.740
 And that's important, I feel like the jingoistic thing is the thing that we need to watch out

1:25:35.740 --> 1:25:37.800
 for.

1:25:37.800 --> 1:25:40.380
 That's just my own personal take.

1:25:40.380 --> 1:25:44.540
 Out of all the projects that the Human Rights Foundation works on, what's the most important

1:25:44.540 --> 1:25:45.540
 one to you right now?

1:25:45.540 --> 1:25:47.460
 Like what that's been occupying your mind?

1:25:47.460 --> 1:25:51.940
 Yeah, I just read again this New Yorker piece that just came out that you should read.

1:25:51.940 --> 1:25:54.420
 It's called Ghost Walls.

1:25:54.420 --> 1:25:59.260
 And it's the story of how the Chinese Communist Party is committing genocide right now, just

1:25:59.260 --> 1:26:04.260
 like other regimes did and the Turks did to the Armenians and the Nazis did to the Jews.

1:26:04.260 --> 1:26:06.060
 And it's happening again right now.

1:26:06.060 --> 1:26:08.900
 We said never again, and you know, that's just not true.

1:26:08.900 --> 1:26:09.900
 We're letting it happen.

1:26:09.900 --> 1:26:16.140
 And again, with the business stuff, like Airbnb is like a sponsor of the Olympics, like what?

1:26:16.140 --> 1:26:20.740
 At the individual level, at a business level, how does somebody like me, who's just one

1:26:20.740 --> 1:26:29.540
 little ant, how does somebody like Elon Musk, who is in charge of 10,000 ants, fight it?

1:26:29.540 --> 1:26:31.880
 How do we push back?

1:26:31.880 --> 1:26:36.100
 A great blueprint is the fight against the South African apartheid.

1:26:36.100 --> 1:26:41.580
 So we did a few events down in Johannesburg, and I've had the pleasure of being able to

1:26:41.580 --> 1:26:43.940
 go to the apartheid museum several times.

1:26:43.940 --> 1:26:46.160
 And it really does a good job of chronicling how they were able to do it.

1:26:46.160 --> 1:26:50.860
 It took a while, there's no doubt, but the way it was done was good.

1:26:50.860 --> 1:26:54.160
 Peaceful action from abroad was very important.

1:26:54.160 --> 1:26:55.780
 So there was like the Sullivan principles.

1:26:55.780 --> 1:27:03.980
 So like you can peacefully protest as a company, particular regimes, and it's very effective.

1:27:03.980 --> 1:27:08.280
 And not just corporations, but like the Olympics is a great example.

1:27:08.280 --> 1:27:10.780
 Like Chinese government should not be able to host the Olympics.

1:27:10.780 --> 1:27:14.340
 The IOC should say no, not until you close down those prison camps.

1:27:14.340 --> 1:27:16.700
 This is a perfect, peaceful way to push back.

1:27:16.700 --> 1:27:17.900
 No one gets hurt.

1:27:17.900 --> 1:27:21.300
 Same thing when we had the Korean Olympics a few years ago, North Korea should not have

1:27:21.300 --> 1:27:24.780
 been allowed any sort of symbolistic kind of hosting rights there.

1:27:24.780 --> 1:27:29.020
 They have prison camps, gulags that we can see from outer space very clearly.

1:27:29.020 --> 1:27:32.480
 And their regime is the cruelest one on the planet probably.

1:27:32.480 --> 1:27:37.560
 Why were they able to sit and cheer and get to sort of cohost the Olympics?

1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:38.560
 This is spineless.

1:27:38.560 --> 1:27:44.380
 Like the IOC, the Olympics, and major corporations should stand up, especially in the cultural

1:27:44.380 --> 1:27:49.300
 sector where you don't lose anything, or you shouldn't have to lose anything.

1:27:49.300 --> 1:27:55.260
 So I think if we look at the way that we forced the apartheid regime out, this international

1:27:55.260 --> 1:27:59.940
 solidarity of musicians, athletes, performers, celebrities is very, very powerful.

1:27:59.940 --> 1:28:02.720
 Unfortunately, today's celebrities are doing the opposite.

1:28:02.720 --> 1:28:08.060
 We just had this press release go out yesterday about ACON, and he's off whitewashing the

1:28:08.060 --> 1:28:13.820
 crimes of the dictator of Uganda and trying to build a future city there with him.

1:28:13.820 --> 1:28:19.140
 If this was the 1980s, ACON would be raising his fist and saying, we need to fight the

1:28:19.140 --> 1:28:20.260
 apartheid regime.

1:28:20.260 --> 1:28:21.940
 How do we get back to that?

1:28:21.940 --> 1:28:22.940
 We need to think about that.

1:28:22.940 --> 1:28:27.860
 We have to figure out how to harness celebrities, influencers, and companies and get them to

1:28:27.860 --> 1:28:29.740
 actually stand up for something for once.

1:28:29.740 --> 1:28:31.540
 I mean, that's something we've lost.

1:28:31.540 --> 1:28:37.600
 We've really had a spine against that, and we've lost it.

1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:38.600
 And you lose things.

1:28:38.600 --> 1:28:39.600
 You lose them forever.

1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:40.600
 Look at Tibet.

1:28:40.600 --> 1:28:42.380
 Tibet was a big cause for people in the 90s.

1:28:42.380 --> 1:28:47.620
 You used to go to colleges and kids would have the Tibetan flags all over the dorm rooms.

1:28:47.620 --> 1:28:51.380
 Go ahead, we'd have Tibet on the stage, and everybody wanted to, you know, free Tibet

1:28:51.380 --> 1:28:52.380
 was a big thing.

1:28:52.380 --> 1:28:53.380
 Well, guess what?

1:28:53.380 --> 1:28:55.300
 Like, we lost it for some reason.

1:28:55.300 --> 1:28:58.580
 It's not a thing anymore, and Tibet has been totally colonized, you know?

1:28:58.580 --> 1:29:05.020
 So I think it's important that we find a way to unlock an interest in the celebrity classes

1:29:05.020 --> 1:29:08.300
 among athletes, singers, presidents.

1:29:08.300 --> 1:29:10.620
 You know, we need to find a way to punish these people.

1:29:10.620 --> 1:29:16.100
 Yeah, it's surprising because we've become more and more connected so we can communicate

1:29:16.100 --> 1:29:22.540
 more effectively at a large scale, and yet we seem to be worse and worse at real activism.

1:29:22.540 --> 1:29:27.300
 It seems like the outrage that's overtaken the communication channels has been very US

1:29:27.300 --> 1:29:34.220
 focused and often more about outrage and less about productive activism.

1:29:34.220 --> 1:29:35.220
 I'm very jaded.

1:29:35.220 --> 1:29:38.940
 I mean, it's very difficult to do these things at scale effectively.

1:29:38.940 --> 1:29:43.420
 I do not believe we will be successful in boycotting the Chinese Olympics.

1:29:43.420 --> 1:29:44.420
 We weren't in 2008.

1:29:44.420 --> 1:29:47.740
 I don't think, and they're much more evil now, and I don't think we're going to be able

1:29:47.740 --> 1:29:49.460
 to do it this time.

1:29:49.460 --> 1:29:53.780
 And again, to go back to the Bitcoin piece, that's why I'm like very interested in this

1:29:53.780 --> 1:29:55.980
 thing because it doesn't require my altruism.

1:29:55.980 --> 1:30:00.780
 It doesn't require some famous singer or some corporation to sacrifice anything.

1:30:00.780 --> 1:30:04.920
 They're literally just going to follow their own profits, seeking self interested motives,

1:30:04.920 --> 1:30:08.860
 and they're going to end up making a stronger human rights tool for other people.

1:30:08.860 --> 1:30:09.860
 Freedom go up.

1:30:09.860 --> 1:30:10.860
 FGU, man.

1:30:10.860 --> 1:30:17.060
 Do you think we're, it's kind of a dark question, but do you think we're headed towards a war

1:30:17.060 --> 1:30:20.540
 with China, the United States versus China?

1:30:20.540 --> 1:30:21.980
 I hope not.

1:30:21.980 --> 1:30:22.980
 I hope not.

1:30:22.980 --> 1:30:25.420
 In the cyberspace and potentially even a hot war.

1:30:25.420 --> 1:30:30.220
 I think there's too many people with too much money to be lost to go to a hot war on both

1:30:30.220 --> 1:30:34.060
 sides, but eventually we're just going to, someone's going to have to stand up.

1:30:34.060 --> 1:30:38.100
 I mean, the subjugation of Hong Kong and the genocide of the Uyghurs and the colonization

1:30:38.100 --> 1:30:39.100
 of Tibet.

1:30:39.100 --> 1:30:40.740
 I mean, Taiwan is the next big thing.

1:30:40.740 --> 1:30:46.180
 I mean, Xi Jinping has made it very clear, you know, Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, Taiwan.

1:30:46.180 --> 1:30:50.980
 So we're going to have to stand up for Taiwan for different reasons, both for moral reasons,

1:30:50.980 --> 1:30:52.500
 but also for semiconductor reasons.

1:30:52.500 --> 1:30:57.020
 We need TSMC to be on our side, not have China take over TSMC.

1:30:57.020 --> 1:31:01.260
 So there's different reasons why we're going to have to protect Taiwan.

1:31:01.260 --> 1:31:02.780
 And you just hope it's not a hot war.

1:31:02.780 --> 1:31:07.900
 I mean, at this point, well, but also from inside the governments of China and Russia

1:31:07.900 --> 1:31:13.700
 as well, but China I guess is the powerhouse here, is how do these governments get reformed?

1:31:13.700 --> 1:31:18.980
 Is there a hope for them to become democracies, like true democracies, representative democracies

1:31:18.980 --> 1:31:26.980
 and sort of reform them to be ethical players on the world stage?

1:31:26.980 --> 1:31:28.940
 No empire lasts forever.

1:31:28.940 --> 1:31:31.140
 And it's impossible to predict when these regimes fall.

1:31:31.140 --> 1:31:34.620
 I mean, no one thought the Soviet Union was going to fall when it fell.

1:31:34.620 --> 1:31:39.620
 Like that, like if you study like the news and the scholarship of the era, no one knew

1:31:39.620 --> 1:31:43.820
 that the Tunisian government was going to fall after Mohammed Bouazizi lit himself on

1:31:43.820 --> 1:31:44.820
 fire.

1:31:44.820 --> 1:31:49.660
 No one predicted that that would become what we now know as the Arab Spring, right?

1:31:49.660 --> 1:31:52.140
 These things are impossible to predict.

1:31:52.140 --> 1:31:54.020
 And one day the Chinese regime will fall.

1:31:54.020 --> 1:31:56.660
 I just, we don't know when.

1:31:56.660 --> 1:31:57.660
 Yes.

1:31:57.660 --> 1:32:02.660
 You know, but, and there's quite a few folks who talk about the fall of the American empire.

1:32:02.660 --> 1:32:06.420
 And it also concerns me that we don't know when that might fall.

1:32:06.420 --> 1:32:12.940
 You assume me as a very excited, naive American, I'm very excited by this project that I think

1:32:12.940 --> 1:32:22.780
 is the beacon of hope in the world still, but that's probably how you feel before it's

1:32:22.780 --> 1:32:23.780
 the end.

1:32:23.780 --> 1:32:28.620
 Yeah, the party, you want to leave the party before it starts to deteriorate.

1:32:28.620 --> 1:32:33.100
 I think America could continue to have like a major, major leadership role for a long,

1:32:33.100 --> 1:32:34.460
 long time.

1:32:34.460 --> 1:32:38.440
 I think certain things we do will become maybe no longer possible in terms of the way we

1:32:38.440 --> 1:32:43.580
 intimidate people on the world stage and especially the way we use our currency as a weapon.

1:32:43.580 --> 1:32:48.840
 I think that that's going to decline over time as we become more of a multipolar world.

1:32:48.840 --> 1:32:53.180
 But I do still believe in America and the values that were founded on despite all the

1:32:53.180 --> 1:32:54.180
 warts.

1:32:54.180 --> 1:32:59.300
 I believe in us and I would prefer us absolutely to be the most prominent of the multipolar

1:32:59.300 --> 1:33:02.300
 world vis a vis a regime like Russia or China.

1:33:02.300 --> 1:33:03.300
 Absolutely.

1:33:03.300 --> 1:33:04.300
 There's no question.

1:33:04.300 --> 1:33:08.420
 So we've been talking about states and nations, but can we just briefly talk about Facebook

1:33:08.420 --> 1:33:11.580
 and Twitter and companies that have a huge impact on the world as well.

1:33:11.580 --> 1:33:16.460
 And actually one of the things that make America a great nation is it is the place from which

1:33:16.460 --> 1:33:18.980
 these great companies have sprung up.

1:33:18.980 --> 1:33:24.220
 Is there, from a human rights perspective, is there something that bothers you about

1:33:24.220 --> 1:33:27.300
 Facebook about these large companies?

1:33:27.300 --> 1:33:29.360
 Is there something we need to fix?

1:33:29.360 --> 1:33:38.220
 Something we need to be upset about, fight back on, reform, do some sort of real activism

1:33:38.220 --> 1:33:39.420
 about?

1:33:39.420 --> 1:33:43.740
 I'm very concerned about social media platforms and companies.

1:33:43.740 --> 1:33:46.140
 It almost feels like we're losing the golden age of the internet.

1:33:46.140 --> 1:33:51.500
 You know, we could like go online and interact with each other and share and not be worried

1:33:51.500 --> 1:33:52.500
 about censorship.

1:33:52.500 --> 1:33:57.180
 It feels like that was a golden age, like in the late nineties, the two thousands, and

1:33:57.180 --> 1:33:59.900
 now everything is becoming very politicized.

1:33:59.900 --> 1:34:02.180
 And I'm not sure that there's a solution.

1:34:02.180 --> 1:34:05.340
 Like I don't think there's a button we can press to fix it.

1:34:05.340 --> 1:34:12.780
 I'm kind of afraid that this is sort of just what happens when societies digitize.

1:34:12.780 --> 1:34:23.100
 Like I think that certain opinions just become demonized in the room and then the social

1:34:23.100 --> 1:34:25.700
 room that we have on the internet.

1:34:25.700 --> 1:34:28.460
 And I don't know if there's a magical solution there.

1:34:28.460 --> 1:34:35.180
 I do know that there's technological solutions that will allow us to continue to communicate

1:34:35.180 --> 1:34:40.060
 and for creators to reach their audiences without censorship.

1:34:40.060 --> 1:34:41.120
 And that's very exciting.

1:34:41.120 --> 1:34:48.220
 Like right now you could be deplatformed from your, you know, from like whether it's Patreon

1:34:48.220 --> 1:34:52.300
 or YouTube or whatever, and your bank account can be closed down, right?

1:34:52.300 --> 1:34:57.220
 There are emerging ways that Adam Curry, like the Podfather and a bunch of other people

1:34:57.220 --> 1:35:02.100
 are experimenting with, where you can essentially have your audio podcast across a whole bunch

1:35:02.100 --> 1:35:04.980
 of different, you know, platforms.

1:35:04.980 --> 1:35:10.420
 So you know, it's censorship resistant, and then your audience can pay you over lightning

1:35:10.420 --> 1:35:11.620
 in streaming money.

1:35:11.620 --> 1:35:13.580
 Like they can stream you money as they listen.

1:35:13.580 --> 1:35:16.080
 So you're removing the whole advertising piece.

1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:18.400
 You don't need to do advertising anymore.

1:35:18.400 --> 1:35:25.020
 You have this direct relationship with your audience.

1:35:25.020 --> 1:35:28.980
 And this is possible with something like lightning where you can do streaming money that's censorship

1:35:28.980 --> 1:35:30.740
 resistant.

1:35:30.740 --> 1:35:34.540
 And a lot of the people who are building a lightning network, for example, Elizabeth

1:35:34.540 --> 1:35:41.220
 Stark who, you know, started Lightning Labs and has done within her company that people

1:35:41.220 --> 1:35:45.420
 that work with her have built a huge part of the lightning infrastructure, you know,

1:35:45.420 --> 1:35:51.020
 what animates her is this idea of like, again, artists and creators being able to have that

1:35:51.020 --> 1:35:57.460
 direct ability to reach out and have that peer to peer relationship with their audience.

1:35:57.460 --> 1:35:59.080
 And I'm excited for that.

1:35:59.080 --> 1:36:05.900
 And I do think that's coming, but I am very worried that the golden age of like centralized

1:36:05.900 --> 1:36:08.780
 social media platforms is kind of behind us.

1:36:08.780 --> 1:36:10.100
 And I'm not sure how to fix that.

1:36:10.100 --> 1:36:11.980
 I don't know if that's like a fixable problem.

1:36:11.980 --> 1:36:12.980
 Interesting.

1:36:12.980 --> 1:36:15.580
 I have a hope that it's a fixable problem.

1:36:15.580 --> 1:36:19.660
 I think it's fixable because there's demand for it to be fixed.

1:36:19.660 --> 1:36:20.860
 That's the way I think about it.

1:36:20.860 --> 1:36:22.540
 Well, is Twitter that bad right now?

1:36:22.540 --> 1:36:25.720
 Like, I mean, it's fixable in as much as you can do a verification.

1:36:25.720 --> 1:36:30.220
 So you can give a blue check to someone and then that person is like more credible and

1:36:30.220 --> 1:36:33.200
 they go to the top of the comments and there's like tweaks you can do.

1:36:33.200 --> 1:36:37.180
 You can continue to improve it, but it's not going to fix the fact that like Twitter can

1:36:37.180 --> 1:36:39.620
 decide to kick off the president.

1:36:39.620 --> 1:36:42.700
 And like a lot of people are going to be upset by that, you know, like there's ways you can

1:36:42.700 --> 1:36:46.880
 improve the UX over time and they continue to do so.

1:36:46.880 --> 1:36:50.660
 Like Clubhouse is a lot of fun, great phenomenon.

1:36:50.660 --> 1:36:52.040
 So is Twitter spaces.

1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:57.780
 So they continue to iterate, but the censorship deplatforming piece, I'm not sure it's fixable

1:36:57.780 --> 1:37:03.440
 because if you, I mean, you watch the US government haul these people, haul Zuckerberg and Dorsey

1:37:03.440 --> 1:37:07.060
 and whatever in front of Congress, they want more censorship.

1:37:07.060 --> 1:37:11.460
 I mean, our elected leaders want more censorship, right?

1:37:11.460 --> 1:37:16.260
 See, I just believe censorship is a really harsh word.

1:37:16.260 --> 1:37:21.100
 I believe it's possible to create technologies where it's not Twitter doing the censorship,

1:37:21.100 --> 1:37:26.900
 but it's individuals doing their own selection of what they want and don't want to see.

1:37:26.900 --> 1:37:31.500
 So for example, if you get sick and tired of Donald Trump and whatever he says, or you

1:37:31.500 --> 1:37:35.580
 love Donald Trump, you get to select yourself.

1:37:35.580 --> 1:37:39.760
 Like you get to have more control over what you consume.

1:37:39.760 --> 1:37:46.500
 Twitter tries to do that a little bit, but they obviously fail where ideas infiltrate

1:37:46.500 --> 1:37:54.260
 our view that misinformation spreads really fast and conspiracy theories spread really

1:37:54.260 --> 1:38:00.720
 fast to where the immune system that Twitter has created to try to censor conspiracy theories

1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:08.020
 and misinformation is over firing and you're now censoring too many people.

1:38:08.020 --> 1:38:11.940
 So it's exactly the same intuition as you said before.

1:38:11.940 --> 1:38:17.500
 If the state is doing it, in this case, Twitter is kind of the state that's not going to work

1:38:17.500 --> 1:38:18.660
 out well.

1:38:18.660 --> 1:38:24.300
 But if you give power to the individuals to do this sort of the, not even censorship,

1:38:24.300 --> 1:38:33.420
 but incentivization and deaccentivization of great thoughtful content and terrible low

1:38:33.420 --> 1:38:39.540
 effort content, then I feel like that's going to create a system where there's going to

1:38:39.540 --> 1:38:45.820
 be a much more open discourse of ideas, dangerous ideas, difficult ideas, controversial ideas,

1:38:45.820 --> 1:38:50.860
 and people in a decentralized way will be able to use their own intelligence to select

1:38:50.860 --> 1:38:53.780
 content to share content, spread content.

1:38:53.780 --> 1:38:55.580
 Let's keep it simple.

1:38:55.580 --> 1:38:58.660
 Let's look at one example, Twitter and Jack Dorsey.

1:38:58.660 --> 1:39:03.980
 And I think it's quite clear that what he believes is the solution is as you're kind

1:39:03.980 --> 1:39:12.020
 of hinting at a more kind of like regionalized system, which is not have one we call federated

1:39:12.020 --> 1:39:13.020
 system, right?

1:39:13.020 --> 1:39:15.680
 Which does not just have like one company in charge of everything, but there's an open

1:39:15.680 --> 1:39:18.860
 protocol and then there's like different instances, right?

1:39:18.860 --> 1:39:24.220
 So Twitter may, you know, Jack's dream for Twitter is that Twitter is this open protocol

1:39:24.220 --> 1:39:27.340
 that the Russian government can use and the Chinese government can use and the Iranian

1:39:27.340 --> 1:39:30.540
 government can use and the American government can use and then Twitter as a company is going

1:39:30.540 --> 1:39:31.660
 to use too.

1:39:31.660 --> 1:39:35.860
 And you as the customer decide which implementation you want to join and there's going to be different

1:39:35.860 --> 1:39:43.600
 censorship on each instance or each federation, but the protocol itself would be like untouchable.

1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:46.060
 This is kind of like the idea behind the internet, right?

1:39:46.060 --> 1:39:50.900
 There's like different parts of the internet that are censored, but like at the very bottom

1:39:50.900 --> 1:39:56.820
 of the very bottom of the backbone of it, it's like this globally connected relatively

1:39:56.820 --> 1:39:58.940
 unstoppable thing, right?

1:39:58.940 --> 1:40:02.420
 So I think that's a pretty good vision and Twitter is working towards that with the blue

1:40:02.420 --> 1:40:03.420
 sky initiative.

1:40:03.420 --> 1:40:04.420
 We'll see.

1:40:04.420 --> 1:40:08.980
 I'm a little skeptical that it like works out because I've used Mastodon, for example.

1:40:08.980 --> 1:40:13.260
 Mastodon is an example of a federated social media.

1:40:13.260 --> 1:40:15.340
 Now it's ruled by a benevolent.

1:40:15.340 --> 1:40:17.860
 Each instance is ruled by a benevolent dictator.

1:40:17.860 --> 1:40:20.580
 It's just like I happen to like this one, so I know.

1:40:20.580 --> 1:40:26.540
 So rather than trust one dictator, Twitter, you could choose which dictator you want to

1:40:26.540 --> 1:40:31.020
 trust and that's kind of the federated model and maybe we head that way, but you lose things.

1:40:31.020 --> 1:40:36.280
 When it's federated, you lose the UX, you lose the slickness and the feel and all the

1:40:36.280 --> 1:40:38.860
 millions of dollars they spend on developers.

1:40:38.860 --> 1:40:43.340
 Like Mastodon is like not anywhere close to as nice to use as Twitter.

1:40:43.340 --> 1:40:46.820
 So I feel like it's, again, it's this trade off that we make with everything where it's

1:40:46.820 --> 1:40:50.600
 convenience, comfort, speed versus privacy and freedom, right?

1:40:50.600 --> 1:40:52.340
 It's very hard to have something that gives you both.

1:40:52.340 --> 1:40:53.340
 I don't know.

1:40:53.340 --> 1:40:55.340
 I think, I think, uh, yeah, it is a trade off.

1:40:55.340 --> 1:40:57.500
 Have you used one of these things that I feel like is good?

1:40:57.500 --> 1:41:01.940
 The federated, they're not, they're not, they're not, but the federated, I don't think it's,

1:41:01.940 --> 1:41:06.820
 it's a good, I think, uh, it requires genius, it requires skill, it requires great design

1:41:06.820 --> 1:41:14.420
 to come up with a way to, you know, there's a Pareto front here, there's a right way to

1:41:14.420 --> 1:41:16.000
 hit that trade off.

1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:24.540
 And I honestly think there's the UX, the experience should be centralized, should be designed

1:41:24.540 --> 1:41:31.900
 by the company, but the data and like a lot of stuff that could be used to violate your

1:41:31.900 --> 1:41:34.540
 basic rights should be owned by the individual.

1:41:34.540 --> 1:41:40.760
 And I think there's a way to decouple those, like create an incredible experience to where

1:41:40.760 --> 1:41:46.740
 you go there and you enjoy the market where you can share your data and have complete

1:41:46.740 --> 1:41:53.840
 control over it and always have, I mean, there's a lot of basic UX ideas, like just as an example,

1:41:53.840 --> 1:42:00.340
 I think there should always be in everything you design, a one button that's always there

1:42:00.340 --> 1:42:06.500
 that says, forget I ever existed, delete everything you know about me.

1:42:06.500 --> 1:42:11.700
 And maybe it's, maybe it's one button that you click and it asks, are you sure?

1:42:11.700 --> 1:42:13.500
 And you have to be able to say yes.

1:42:13.500 --> 1:42:17.980
 Like that's a feature that's fundamental to a good social network, I believe.

1:42:17.980 --> 1:42:23.460
 Like currently social networks, first of all, most of them don't allow you to do that.

1:42:23.460 --> 1:42:27.320
 They don't make it transparent how much data they had, who they shared it with.

1:42:27.320 --> 1:42:30.380
 And they also make it exceptionally difficult to delete accounts.

1:42:30.380 --> 1:42:37.060
 So like that's a very basic starting point, but that having that button means that you

1:42:37.060 --> 1:42:39.980
 have control, but that's step one of the control.

1:42:39.980 --> 1:42:45.900
 There's a transparency of knowing exactly when, what data is being shared about you,

1:42:45.900 --> 1:42:50.300
 how much data is already being recorded about you, all that is transparency.

1:42:50.300 --> 1:42:54.300
 And I believe in the, I believe that's a really good business model, because when there's

1:42:54.300 --> 1:42:59.500
 transparency and control, people would be willing to give over a lot more data as long

1:42:59.500 --> 1:43:03.700
 as they know what they're given over, as long as they know what they can delete.

1:43:03.700 --> 1:43:04.700
 Yeah.

1:43:04.700 --> 1:43:10.180
 I guess maybe you're more optimistic about people caring about, I feel like not so few

1:43:10.180 --> 1:43:12.420
 people actually care about their privacy and freedom.

1:43:12.420 --> 1:43:17.600
 I've just watched everybody give it up, you know, but we'll see, I guess just to book

1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:21.740
 in that I think we're at this moment where obviously the centralized platforms are just

1:43:21.740 --> 1:43:27.300
 so much easier and better to use and to strike it out and, you know, adventure out and use

1:43:27.300 --> 1:43:32.420
 a like a federated instance or something even like Keybase, which is kind of like a cool

1:43:32.420 --> 1:43:35.420
 encrypted way to like have group chats.

1:43:35.420 --> 1:43:39.620
 It just requires like a lot of your time and a lot of people don't have that time.

1:43:39.620 --> 1:43:44.380
 But I will say one thing, like I do think there is this future where we do go into more

1:43:44.380 --> 1:43:51.940
 of this like, it's called a tribal model or like tribes, which is this social environment

1:43:51.940 --> 1:43:57.520
 being built on top of lightning by an app called Sphinx.

1:43:57.520 --> 1:44:00.780
 And the idea is like kind of like it's like a decentralized Slack, like you have your

1:44:00.780 --> 1:44:04.460
 Slack instance, which has like a bunch of people in the community and you have different

1:44:04.460 --> 1:44:07.620
 ways to message each other and it's all encrypted.

1:44:07.620 --> 1:44:11.260
 And then it has like plugins for like things like Jitsi instead of Zoom.

1:44:11.260 --> 1:44:14.700
 So like an open source encrypted video messenger.

1:44:14.700 --> 1:44:20.900
 It has ways to like plug in the content you want to get from like different platforms

1:44:20.900 --> 1:44:23.320
 that you follow, like podcasts, things like that.

1:44:23.320 --> 1:44:27.300
 And again, it allows you to pay those people directly in a censorship resistant private

1:44:27.300 --> 1:44:28.300
 way.

1:44:28.300 --> 1:44:29.580
 So it's really nice to connect to the lightning network.

1:44:29.580 --> 1:44:30.580
 Yeah.

1:44:30.580 --> 1:44:33.820
 So it's all sort of built on lightning, but the idea you can think about it as like you're

1:44:33.820 --> 1:44:38.620
 slowly starting to build up the idea of a WeChat, but with freedom principles.

1:44:38.620 --> 1:44:41.540
 Because right now, WeChat's like the king of convenience and comfort, but of course

1:44:41.540 --> 1:44:45.260
 it's feeding all that data to the big brother and the surveillance state.

1:44:45.260 --> 1:44:49.140
 And then we have like our own versions over here in America that are not quite as convenient

1:44:49.140 --> 1:44:53.460
 or amazing, but like we give up slightly less privacy and freedom.

1:44:53.460 --> 1:44:55.960
 But this thing has a lot of promising features to it.

1:44:55.960 --> 1:44:56.960
 It's worth checking out.

1:44:56.960 --> 1:44:58.140
 It's very like early days.

1:44:58.140 --> 1:45:03.420
 Like it feels like, I mean, I was pretty young, but it feels like the nineties in the internet.

1:45:03.420 --> 1:45:07.780
 Like it has that feeling where you, yeah, you know it's rough around the edges, but

1:45:07.780 --> 1:45:09.260
 you can feel the magic.

1:45:09.260 --> 1:45:10.260
 It's pretty cool.

1:45:10.260 --> 1:45:12.940
 I'm very much like with Steve Jobs on this.

1:45:12.940 --> 1:45:17.540
 I think the founding principles are exceptionally important, but at the end of the day, the

1:45:17.540 --> 1:45:22.780
 design of how sleek it is, how easy it is to use.

1:45:22.780 --> 1:45:26.980
 And that's not just like pretty icing on the cake.

1:45:26.980 --> 1:45:33.060
 That is the icing is the cake because like how easy it is to use, how natural it is.

1:45:33.060 --> 1:45:34.380
 It's the Trojan horse thing.

1:45:34.380 --> 1:45:39.960
 Like you don't get, it has to be pretty and shiny and it has to have, it has to fundamentally

1:45:39.960 --> 1:45:44.140
 connect to the basics of human nature, which is what is pleasant to use, what feels good

1:45:44.140 --> 1:45:45.680
 to use.

1:45:45.680 --> 1:45:49.980
 You have to, you know, to trick people into eating the broccoli, you have to put like

1:45:49.980 --> 1:45:51.540
 a delicious whatever on it.

1:45:51.540 --> 1:45:53.820
 Well, again, PGP is a kind of a pain to use, right?

1:45:53.820 --> 1:45:54.820
 For if you want privacy.

1:45:54.820 --> 1:45:55.820
 Yeah.

1:45:55.820 --> 1:45:56.820
 So Signal is an upgrade.

1:45:56.820 --> 1:45:57.820
 Signal is way better.

1:45:57.820 --> 1:46:01.860
 I mean, and it's way better than it was five years ago and it's, it's not quite as good

1:46:01.860 --> 1:46:07.740
 as like not quite as seamless, right, as like a WhatsApp yet, but it's almost there.

1:46:07.740 --> 1:46:12.420
 And they were able to do it and you're going to see that with, with Bitcoin wallets as

1:46:12.420 --> 1:46:13.420
 well.

1:46:13.420 --> 1:46:14.420
 I mean, they're, they're almost there.

1:46:14.420 --> 1:46:18.740
 They're like, if you use like a moon wallet is like, I mean, it's so cool looking and

1:46:18.740 --> 1:46:22.860
 it's so seamless and they've spent so many hours thinking about your experience.

1:46:22.860 --> 1:46:23.940
 We are getting there.

1:46:23.940 --> 1:46:25.980
 Whereas 10 years ago, it was like impossible to use.

1:46:25.980 --> 1:46:32.140
 One of the things that Signal doesn't have, and I believe these kinds of applications

1:46:32.140 --> 1:46:39.540
 need to have is like a, I hate the term, but killer app, which is like a dumb, but very

1:46:39.540 --> 1:46:42.660
 viral and popular reason to switch it.

1:46:42.660 --> 1:46:50.020
 I didn't see exactly, I mean, I've been using Signal, but I haven't seen a you know, a big

1:46:50.020 --> 1:46:51.020
 reason to, to switch.

1:46:51.020 --> 1:46:52.020
 Well, you're on it, man.

1:46:52.020 --> 1:46:53.020
 To switch.

1:46:53.020 --> 1:46:54.020
 I mean, the reason.

1:46:54.020 --> 1:46:56.660
 But I haven't switched everything to it, you know what I mean?

1:46:56.660 --> 1:46:57.660
 Like a.

1:46:57.660 --> 1:46:58.660
 Yeah.

1:46:58.660 --> 1:47:04.580
 The exodus to Signal was in, in January, they had a huge user surge for two main reasons.

1:47:04.580 --> 1:47:09.460
 One hilariously enough, of course, was Elon tweeted, like you should use Signal, right?

1:47:09.460 --> 1:47:10.780
 Which is not insignificant.

1:47:10.780 --> 1:47:14.860
 And then the other one was that like WhatsApp changed kind of some of its terms of service

1:47:14.860 --> 1:47:19.700
 and like, you know, announced to all of its users in this little pop up that it was going

1:47:19.700 --> 1:47:21.840
 to be sort of like changing the way it handled your data.

1:47:21.840 --> 1:47:23.220
 That spooked a lot of people.

1:47:23.220 --> 1:47:28.700
 So these two things really combined and tens of millions of people in the following weeks

1:47:28.700 --> 1:47:30.780
 between January and February joined Signal.

1:47:30.780 --> 1:47:35.880
 It's like it really has had its day in the sun and they are like frantically trying to

1:47:35.880 --> 1:47:36.880
 keep up with it.

1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:42.460
 Like, and it's really nice to see that, that, that this encrypted messaging service, which,

1:47:42.460 --> 1:47:48.580
 which prioritizes your privacy in a way that, you know, you know, the government again may

1:47:48.580 --> 1:47:51.800
 know like the metadata, but doesn't know exactly what you're saying unless they can get your

1:47:51.800 --> 1:47:52.800
 hands on your phone.

1:47:52.800 --> 1:47:54.260
 I think that's very, very powerful.

1:47:54.260 --> 1:47:55.800
 So it can be done.

1:47:55.800 --> 1:47:57.500
 I don't want to be too jaded here.

1:47:57.500 --> 1:47:58.500
 I think it can be done.

1:47:58.500 --> 1:47:59.500
 Yeah, I think so.

1:47:59.500 --> 1:48:03.980
 I think we can fight back and I think we can make, continue to make these digital communications

1:48:03.980 --> 1:48:08.940
 tools and platforms in a way that, that, that really benefits us.

1:48:08.940 --> 1:48:09.940
 Yeah.

1:48:09.940 --> 1:48:14.060
 I'm not, I'm not sure, but I'm hopeful as well.

1:48:14.060 --> 1:48:17.900
 I'm hopeful that if you look at the trend of technologies, they ultimately are ones

1:48:17.900 --> 1:48:23.580
 that respect privacy, respect security and basic human rights.

1:48:23.580 --> 1:48:25.940
 I mean, that's at least the hope.

1:48:25.940 --> 1:48:28.540
 So Gary Kasparov, I'm Russian.

1:48:28.540 --> 1:48:31.000
 He means a lot to me on a personal level.

1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:35.580
 He is the chairman of a human rights foundation.

1:48:35.580 --> 1:48:37.200
 What does Gary have to do with anything?

1:48:37.200 --> 1:48:39.260
 What's your relationship like with him?

1:48:39.260 --> 1:48:41.560
 Do you like chess?

1:48:41.560 --> 1:48:45.140
 What are his specific focuses and ideas around the HRF?

1:48:45.140 --> 1:48:46.900
 Can you just speak to it in general?

1:48:46.900 --> 1:48:52.740
 Yeah, so our chairman at the human rights foundation was Václav Havel, who of course

1:48:52.740 --> 1:48:59.380
 was like the famous Czech democracy activist who, you know, helped lead the Velvet Revolution

1:48:59.380 --> 1:49:05.800
 and then ended up becoming the first democratically elected leader of the Czech Republic after

1:49:05.800 --> 1:49:08.020
 the Soviet Union fell.

1:49:08.020 --> 1:49:14.660
 He passed away in 2011 and it was very difficult to find a replacement because who can fill

1:49:14.660 --> 1:49:16.580
 Havel's shoes, you know?

1:49:16.580 --> 1:49:19.160
 But if one could, it would be Gary, right?

1:49:19.160 --> 1:49:23.860
 So we like really tried to get Gary to join and thankfully he agreed and we've had an

1:49:23.860 --> 1:49:26.140
 amazing relationship with Gary over the years.

1:49:26.140 --> 1:49:28.860
 I mean, he's been relentless in his pursuit of freedom.

1:49:28.860 --> 1:49:32.980
 I mean, he could have retired and taken his career in a different direction and he could

1:49:32.980 --> 1:49:37.100
 be hanging out with Putin and have a pleasure yacht and all kinds of stuff, but he decided

1:49:37.100 --> 1:49:39.220
 to risk it.

1:49:39.220 --> 1:49:43.860
 And if you actually study like the times when he was running for president in Russia, Amash

1:49:43.860 --> 1:49:48.380
 Gessen followed him around in The Man Without a Face, it's a great, great book about Putin.

1:49:48.380 --> 1:49:53.820
 There's a fabulous chapter where she's following around Gary when he's campaigning and I mean,

1:49:53.820 --> 1:49:54.820
 he risked a lot.

1:49:54.820 --> 1:49:58.860
 I mean, he can't go back to Russia anymore, he gave up his country, he's given up a huge

1:49:58.860 --> 1:50:03.880
 amount to be able to speak his mind and to have this dream, this beautiful vision of

1:50:03.880 --> 1:50:06.380
 a free and democratic Russia, he really believes in it.

1:50:06.380 --> 1:50:11.460
 It's been a great experience, I work very closely with Gary, we talk a lot, we do different

1:50:11.460 --> 1:50:13.380
 things around the world together.

1:50:13.380 --> 1:50:18.140
 He's come out to a lot of events in different cities around the world.

1:50:18.140 --> 1:50:22.020
 And he's been a very active chairman, this isn't some figurehead, he's very involved

1:50:22.020 --> 1:50:23.420
 and it's really, really great.

1:50:23.420 --> 1:50:29.000
 I mean, everything he's involved with is, as one journalist who attends our events says,

1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:33.460
 when he walks in the room, the average IQ of the room goes up pretty significantly.

1:50:33.460 --> 1:50:37.820
 I'm not a big chess person, unfortunately, so I have not been able to connect with him

1:50:37.820 --> 1:50:40.580
 on that, but I think he probably would prefer it that way.

1:50:40.580 --> 1:50:43.480
 All he gets is people who want to talk to him about chess.

1:50:43.480 --> 1:50:51.060
 So here we can talk about human rights strategy and how to improve our fight against dictators.

1:50:51.060 --> 1:50:57.540
 But he really has that moral clarity that I really appreciate.

1:50:57.540 --> 1:51:02.660
 Yeah, he has a lot of fascinating ideas about artificial intelligence as well.

1:51:02.660 --> 1:51:11.540
 Please open my eyes a little bit to the state of Russia today, because I've read most books

1:51:11.540 --> 1:51:18.180
 on Putin in the English language, in sort of trying to understand things.

1:51:18.180 --> 1:51:23.640
 And I try to look at it from a historical perspective, almost like we're living a hundred

1:51:23.640 --> 1:51:30.100
 years from now, and I look at Putin as an important figure in the history of human civilization

1:51:30.100 --> 1:51:33.020
 and study it in that way.

1:51:33.020 --> 1:51:36.780
 I think the way Gary looks at it, he probably doesn't appreciate me looking at the way I

1:51:36.780 --> 1:51:47.300
 do, but the way he looks at it is we can still change the direction of Russia, and we individual

1:51:47.300 --> 1:51:53.700
 human beings and we communities and we nations can take actions, have policies that can change

1:51:53.700 --> 1:51:55.260
 the direction of Russia.

1:51:55.260 --> 1:52:01.460
 To me, I take a sort of going to the library, passive view of studying fascinating aspects

1:52:01.460 --> 1:52:02.460
 of Russia.

1:52:02.460 --> 1:52:08.240
 To me, Russia means like most of my family suffered through the Soviet Union, and I see

1:52:08.240 --> 1:52:14.720
 beauty in suffering, the poetry, the music, the stories, and just there's so much love

1:52:14.720 --> 1:52:18.820
 that emerged from the pain that I just enjoy the music of that.

1:52:18.820 --> 1:52:27.380
 But to Gary and to many activists that I speak to, to them, they love not just the Russia

1:52:27.380 --> 1:52:28.980
 of the past.

1:52:28.980 --> 1:52:33.740
 They have a vision and a hope for Russia of the future.

1:52:33.740 --> 1:52:37.980
 And they criticize me a little bit for being a little bit too scholarly about the past

1:52:37.980 --> 1:52:40.920
 and ignoring the future, and there's something to that.

1:52:40.920 --> 1:52:45.620
 So he opens my eyes to look to the future of Russia.

1:52:45.620 --> 1:52:51.060
 Gary and a handful of other Russian activists that we work closely with, including Vladimir

1:52:51.060 --> 1:52:55.820
 Karamurza, who again, I mean, it's just incredibly heroic, the man has survived two poisonings

1:52:55.820 --> 1:52:57.540
 by Putin.

1:52:57.540 --> 1:53:02.660
 They like to say that, you know, Russians will bring democracy to Russia on their own

1:53:02.660 --> 1:53:03.660
 terms.

1:53:03.660 --> 1:53:04.660
 They don't need our help.

1:53:04.660 --> 1:53:07.100
 This is what Vladimir especially says.

1:53:07.100 --> 1:53:10.100
 But what he does say is that we should stop propping up Putin.

1:53:10.100 --> 1:53:13.740
 Like that's kind of his, stop kind of legitimizing him.

1:53:13.740 --> 1:53:15.240
 That's kind of his argument.

1:53:15.240 --> 1:53:17.540
 Is like, we don't need your foreign interference.

1:53:17.540 --> 1:53:18.540
 We don't need your ideas.

1:53:18.540 --> 1:53:19.780
 We don't, you know, we don't need your help.

1:53:19.780 --> 1:53:24.480
 We can do it on our own, but please stop like propping up our, you know, illegitimate ruler.

1:53:24.480 --> 1:53:29.700
 That's kind of like his point of view, which I think is interesting and fair.

1:53:29.700 --> 1:53:30.700
 Yeah.

1:53:30.700 --> 1:53:38.300
 Let me just say on one unrelated comment, some people criticize me and others like Joe

1:53:38.300 --> 1:53:44.020
 Rogan for giving people a platform.

1:53:44.020 --> 1:53:50.940
 I think in some cases that's applicable, but I think in most cases, knowledge is power

1:53:50.940 --> 1:53:54.020
 and there's no such thing as giving a platform.

1:53:54.020 --> 1:53:58.960
 The conversation just shines a light as long as you shine the light well.

1:53:58.960 --> 1:54:05.780
 And as long as in shining the light and having the conversation, you reveal something fundamental

1:54:05.780 --> 1:54:10.940
 about the state of things, about the people, whether that's Putin or some of the other

1:54:10.940 --> 1:54:16.140
 controversial figures that have come up in a possible future conversation.

1:54:16.140 --> 1:54:20.020
 So I don't like this kind of platforming idea.

1:54:20.020 --> 1:54:22.300
 I think conversations save us.

1:54:22.300 --> 1:54:23.300
 They don't destroy us.

1:54:23.300 --> 1:54:24.300
 Yeah.

1:54:24.300 --> 1:54:26.500
 I mean, that's, that's journalism though.

1:54:26.500 --> 1:54:31.440
 I mean, that's very different from, you know, advocacy or strategic thinking about what

1:54:31.440 --> 1:54:32.700
 to do with Russia.

1:54:32.700 --> 1:54:33.700
 Absolutely.

1:54:33.700 --> 1:54:34.700
 Yeah.

1:54:34.700 --> 1:54:37.460
 We should interview everybody and everybody should know exactly what they're thinking.

1:54:37.460 --> 1:54:38.460
 Yeah.

1:54:38.460 --> 1:54:43.180
 I think, you know, journalism to me has become a dirty word because, because it's done so

1:54:43.180 --> 1:54:51.700
 poorly by so many people that, you know, I listened to sometimes certain programs, like,

1:54:51.700 --> 1:54:57.820
 I don't know, like, uh, meet the press and the Fox Sunday program, just certain things

1:54:57.820 --> 1:55:02.980
 just to tune in and see what different news medias are paying attention to.

1:55:02.980 --> 1:55:07.860
 And the kind of interviews they do, you know, is like five minutes at most, but usually

1:55:07.860 --> 1:55:13.820
 it's like one minute it's these quick clip things and it's very gotcha and they're looking

1:55:13.820 --> 1:55:17.660
 for ways to sort of grab almost a misstatement.

1:55:17.660 --> 1:55:19.960
 They want to catch you off guard.

1:55:19.960 --> 1:55:25.980
 They want to ask the quote, like, like the harsh question, but without any of the, like

1:55:25.980 --> 1:55:30.380
 the dance of conversation that reveals the truth, you know, you can't just get to the

1:55:30.380 --> 1:55:33.760
 truth by asking it.

1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:36.860
 You have to sneak up on it.

1:55:36.860 --> 1:55:38.940
 And I think that's an art form.

1:55:38.940 --> 1:55:42.180
 And I think that art form involves long form conversation.

1:55:42.180 --> 1:55:46.860
 Like I'm a huge believer in just, I guess that's, what's called, I don't know, in depth

1:55:46.860 --> 1:55:52.760
 journal or whatever, like where you spend months or years on a story in that same way.

1:55:52.760 --> 1:55:57.460
 I think of long form conversation is like you spend many hours and you spend months

1:55:57.460 --> 1:56:02.900
 and years preparing for those many hours, but like, it's not this like short form trying

1:56:02.900 --> 1:56:07.420
 to, trying to get the most controversial little tidbit of a story out.

1:56:07.420 --> 1:56:13.020
 And unfortunately the funding mechanisms behind journalism are such that they are incentivized

1:56:13.020 --> 1:56:18.620
 clickbait journalism versus like in depth long form digging for the truth.

1:56:18.620 --> 1:56:23.300
 I have a conflicted relationship with journalism because to me, press freedom is so core and

1:56:23.300 --> 1:56:27.460
 independent journalists around the world are so brave, especially in countries like Russia

1:56:27.460 --> 1:56:29.180
 or China, et cetera.

1:56:29.180 --> 1:56:34.980
 And really good journalism is still something I absolutely, I love and I enjoy.

1:56:34.980 --> 1:56:38.460
 Like this, especially like to say again, this New Yorker piece on what's happening to the

1:56:38.460 --> 1:56:40.860
 Uyghurs is incredibly well reported.

1:56:40.860 --> 1:56:47.220
 However, on the other hand, you have this sort of clickbaity journalism that's all about

1:56:47.220 --> 1:56:49.860
 sensationalism and that gets used as a tool.

1:56:49.860 --> 1:56:55.700
 I mean, whether it be against things like privacy or Bitcoin or whatever, you have like

1:56:55.700 --> 1:57:00.700
 people who sensationalize and it gets used in the service of the surveillance state,

1:57:00.700 --> 1:57:02.340
 the war on terror or whatever.

1:57:02.340 --> 1:57:08.380
 You know, it's difficult, but you know, I think journalism is essential to a free society.

1:57:08.380 --> 1:57:13.380
 But it can sometimes be, it can wear my patience thin sometimes.

1:57:13.380 --> 1:57:17.260
 Like it's been, to be honest, it's been a huge burden on me personally, if I were to

1:57:17.260 --> 1:57:20.300
 just turn this into a therapy session for a brief moment.

1:57:20.300 --> 1:57:25.340
 When I look at people, when I interact with people, I'd like to see the best in them.

1:57:25.340 --> 1:57:32.940
 And the burden that weighs heavy on me is sometimes people I talk to may not be good

1:57:32.940 --> 1:57:33.940
 people.

1:57:33.940 --> 1:57:41.420
 And I don't, I'd love to, I believe everybody has good in them and I try to focus on that.

1:57:41.420 --> 1:57:47.540
 The burden that weighs on me is sometimes that there may be conversations where that's

1:57:47.540 --> 1:57:53.620
 irresponsible, where I have to also call people out.

1:57:53.620 --> 1:57:58.580
 I have to do enough of the hard lifting and the hard work of knowing exactly what are

1:57:58.580 --> 1:58:02.020
 the bad things that that person has done.

1:58:02.020 --> 1:58:05.380
 And I also have the responsibility to call them out on it.

1:58:05.380 --> 1:58:08.100
 And that's for me personally, just an unpleasant feeling.

1:58:08.100 --> 1:58:13.220
 That's where speaking to journalism, like I think journalists are too much focused on

1:58:13.220 --> 1:58:21.820
 the bad things a person has done and not enough on the digging into the full complexity of

1:58:21.820 --> 1:58:25.380
 the human being behind all the things that have been done.

1:58:25.380 --> 1:58:32.580
 But at the same time, you know, I can't have a conversation with Hitler and not ask about

1:58:32.580 --> 1:58:33.580
 the prison camps.

1:58:33.580 --> 1:58:34.580
 Yeah.

1:58:34.580 --> 1:58:35.580
 Yeah.

1:58:35.580 --> 1:58:36.580
 Yeah.

1:58:36.580 --> 1:58:37.580
 No.

1:58:37.580 --> 1:58:39.900
 So from the human rights perspective, one of our programs is we like, we try to go after

1:58:39.900 --> 1:58:42.040
 people who do like PR for dictators.

1:58:42.040 --> 1:58:47.320
 So like, like then a lot of people do like PR firms in Washington get hired by all these

1:58:47.320 --> 1:58:51.740
 dictators and make a lot of money to make them look good.

1:58:51.740 --> 1:58:54.780
 It's called whitewashing or putting lipstick on a pig or whatever you want to do.

1:58:54.780 --> 1:58:58.220
 Astroturfing is like the fake, make like fake social media accounts to make it seem like

1:58:58.220 --> 1:58:59.980
 you're popular.

1:58:59.980 --> 1:59:01.420
 But whitewashing is a huge issue.

1:59:01.420 --> 1:59:07.500
 So I think it's completely fair to interview like dictators and stuff like that.

1:59:07.500 --> 1:59:10.100
 Amanpour does a pretty good job.

1:59:10.100 --> 1:59:11.100
 She's really good.

1:59:11.100 --> 1:59:13.940
 She makes sure that there's no messing around.

1:59:13.940 --> 1:59:18.420
 I mean, her interviews of Museveni recently, the Ugandan dictator was very good.

1:59:18.420 --> 1:59:22.820
 I mean, she's basically like, well, like, well, why are you rigging another election?

1:59:22.820 --> 1:59:27.300
 Please tell us, you know, and she's fearless and she's good and that can be a helpful thing

1:59:27.300 --> 1:59:30.100
 to have on YouTube as a resource.

1:59:30.100 --> 1:59:35.700
 But it's, it's, it's quite clear when, when it descends into a PR session and you just

1:59:35.700 --> 1:59:37.540
 have to be like very careful about it.

1:59:37.540 --> 1:59:43.420
 Like Asma al Assad, the wife of the butcher in Syria, you know, was like profiled by Vogue

1:59:43.420 --> 1:59:49.100
 and it was this whole rose in the desert things, a bunch of nonsense, terrible, terrible, terrible,

1:59:49.100 --> 1:59:50.500
 total propaganda.

1:59:50.500 --> 1:59:57.800
 But a like honest interview where you, you know, you're asking about all the tough questions.

1:59:57.800 --> 1:59:58.800
 Very important.

1:59:58.800 --> 2:00:01.140
 You know, so I think, I think it's just a matter of like content.

2:00:01.140 --> 2:00:03.980
 Is this, is there a good resource to study whitewashing?

2:00:03.980 --> 2:00:07.340
 Like to know what manipulative PR looks like?

2:00:07.340 --> 2:00:11.740
 I think you just, you should know if you've researched the topic, you should know it inside

2:00:11.740 --> 2:00:15.700
 you because it would be, is there anything you're afraid to ask?

2:00:15.700 --> 2:00:16.700
 That would be it.

2:00:16.700 --> 2:00:17.700
 Make sure you're asking all the questions.

2:00:17.700 --> 2:00:21.100
 As long as you're asking all the questions that you have, you're good.

2:00:21.100 --> 2:00:25.420
 But if there's something you're afraid to ask, then, then maybe you're self censoring,

2:00:25.420 --> 2:00:26.420
 right?

2:00:26.420 --> 2:00:27.420
 That's a good way.

2:00:27.420 --> 2:00:32.340
 It's, it takes us back to that, like what is it that litmus test about is your country

2:00:32.340 --> 2:00:36.060
 a lot to have a gay pride parade?

2:00:36.060 --> 2:00:39.980
 So there's like obvious things that might be on your mind that you just want to ask

2:00:39.980 --> 2:00:41.980
 and you shouldn't, you shouldn't run from them.

2:00:41.980 --> 2:00:46.380
 As long as you feel like you're a free person when you're interviewing, I think you're good.

2:00:46.380 --> 2:00:48.820
 That's beautifully put.

2:00:48.820 --> 2:00:56.340
 Are there books, technical fiction, philosophical that had an impact on your life that you recommend

2:00:56.340 --> 2:00:59.900
 or even resources like blogs, films?

2:00:59.900 --> 2:01:04.200
 I have four books I'll briefly mention.

2:01:04.200 --> 2:01:05.780
 Number one is The Fear.

2:01:05.780 --> 2:01:07.800
 The Fear had a deep impact on me.

2:01:07.800 --> 2:01:09.600
 The Fear was written by Peter Godwin.

2:01:09.600 --> 2:01:14.140
 It's about the systematic dismantling of Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe.

2:01:14.140 --> 2:01:17.420
 Peter is Zimbabwean and it is a riveting book.

2:01:17.420 --> 2:01:21.020
 I think everyone should read it because it helps you understand what it's like to go

2:01:21.020 --> 2:01:24.980
 through not just authoritarianism, but also hyperinflation.

2:01:24.980 --> 2:01:28.700
 And I mean, really, you know, at the end of the day, what The Fear describes is how Mugabe

2:01:28.700 --> 2:01:34.980
 took this country in the 1980s and he actually brought it back in time to the 1920s in terms

2:01:34.980 --> 2:01:38.580
 of infrastructure, literacy rates, health rates, all these things.

2:01:38.580 --> 2:01:40.660
 He stole so much from the people.

2:01:40.660 --> 2:01:44.740
 And it's a heartbreaking book, but it's a very important book.

2:01:44.740 --> 2:01:49.340
 And it's a way to do excellent, excellent journalism.

2:01:49.340 --> 2:01:50.820
 So The Fear is a good one.

2:01:50.820 --> 2:01:52.660
 And it's a personal story?

2:01:52.660 --> 2:01:53.660
 Absolutely.

2:01:53.660 --> 2:01:54.660
 Yeah.

2:01:54.660 --> 2:01:57.780
 Because he was, it's part of his whole family story and he's in there.

2:01:57.780 --> 2:02:00.520
 He's interviewing people personally.

2:02:00.520 --> 2:02:02.340
 So I would say that one.

2:02:02.340 --> 2:02:06.820
 Is it also connected, sorry to interrupt, is it, from the inflation perspective, is

2:02:06.820 --> 2:02:10.060
 it a good study of hyperinflation and the effects?

2:02:10.060 --> 2:02:16.900
 Does Bitcoin at all come as a discussion of money?

2:02:16.900 --> 2:02:21.420
 Does that come into the, or is it purely the experience of inflation is almost a symptom

2:02:21.420 --> 2:02:22.420
 of an authoritarian government?

2:02:22.420 --> 2:02:23.420
 A little bit, a little bit.

2:02:23.420 --> 2:02:24.420
 I would say it's not deep.

2:02:24.420 --> 2:02:29.200
 I have another book on that, which I'll recommend in a second, but I would just say that it's

2:02:29.200 --> 2:02:37.420
 a very powerfully written book about how society can basically deteriorate and how you can

2:02:37.420 --> 2:02:39.460
 lose everything.

2:02:39.460 --> 2:02:44.140
 The second book is, I just mentioned it, but The Man Without a Face by Masha Gessen.

2:02:44.140 --> 2:02:46.340
 Incredible book about modern Russia and Putin.

2:02:46.340 --> 2:02:47.780
 Just a masterpiece.

2:02:47.780 --> 2:02:48.780
 So that one is.

2:02:48.780 --> 2:02:50.940
 Could be one of your favorite books about Putin and Russia.

2:02:50.940 --> 2:02:51.940
 That one's the best.

2:02:51.940 --> 2:02:53.460
 I mean, she's just so fearless.

2:02:53.460 --> 2:02:54.460
 Incredible.

2:02:54.460 --> 2:02:56.820
 She interviews Putin in the book at the end.

2:02:56.820 --> 2:02:57.820
 It's really good.

2:02:57.820 --> 2:03:04.900
 The third one is a fiction book called The Mandibles written by Lionel Shriver.

2:03:04.900 --> 2:03:05.900
 This one's good.

2:03:05.900 --> 2:03:06.900
 It's a good gift book.

2:03:06.900 --> 2:03:07.900
 It's funny.

2:03:07.900 --> 2:03:08.900
 It's dark.

2:03:08.900 --> 2:03:12.980
 It's witty, but it's about the United States losing its status as the reserve currency

2:03:12.980 --> 2:03:15.040
 and going into hyperinflation.

2:03:15.040 --> 2:03:19.260
 And what's interesting is that the characters in the book map where we are today.

2:03:19.260 --> 2:03:22.660
 The book itself is about the late, I think it's the late 2020s.

2:03:22.660 --> 2:03:27.460
 And we have a populist president who decides to announce that the United States is like

2:03:27.460 --> 2:03:29.020
 basically going to default on its debts.

2:03:29.020 --> 2:03:33.100
 And the rest of the world comes up with like a new currency and everybody switches to that

2:03:33.100 --> 2:03:36.460
 one and the dollar like overnight becomes worthless.

2:03:36.460 --> 2:03:39.480
 And all these like economists are saying, no, it's fine.

2:03:39.480 --> 2:03:41.780
 Like inflation won't be a problem.

2:03:41.780 --> 2:03:45.140
 And there's this one character who's an economist who's like an economist.

2:03:45.140 --> 2:03:49.300
 And he's basically he gets to the point where he's living as a refugee in Prospect Park

2:03:49.300 --> 2:03:51.940
 in Brooklyn and he's still saying everything's fine.

2:03:51.940 --> 2:03:57.100
 You know, so it's like it's dry, it's witty, but it's also about the surveillance state.

2:03:57.100 --> 2:03:59.460
 It's about centralization of power.

2:03:59.460 --> 2:04:00.460
 It's really good.

2:04:00.460 --> 2:04:03.820
 So The Mandibles, I would highly recommend.

2:04:03.820 --> 2:04:04.820
 So those three books.

2:04:04.820 --> 2:04:08.340
 And then on the topic of Bitcoin, because we talked about it a lot, I would just say

2:04:08.340 --> 2:04:14.820
 that my portal into Bitcoin was The Internet of Money by Andreas Antonopoulos and I did

2:04:14.820 --> 2:04:16.980
 it by audio book.

2:04:16.980 --> 2:04:21.260
 And I just think this is an important one for people to start with because he goes through

2:04:21.260 --> 2:04:27.260
 all the main concepts, whether it be proof of work or how the network functions.

2:04:27.260 --> 2:04:31.580
 But he does it in a way that's extremely engaging and really fascinating.

2:04:31.580 --> 2:04:34.820
 And it really just kind of like sparked my curiosity.

2:04:34.820 --> 2:04:38.300
 Is it discussing the technical sides or also the philosophical?

2:04:38.300 --> 2:04:41.340
 Because a lot of people mentioned sort of the Bitcoin standard is the philosophical

2:04:41.340 --> 2:04:43.700
 entry into the whole Bitcoin world.

2:04:43.700 --> 2:04:45.300
 Very different from the Bitcoin standard.

2:04:45.300 --> 2:04:47.720
 It's more for like the average person.

2:04:47.720 --> 2:04:49.260
 It's not a history book.

2:04:49.260 --> 2:04:52.620
 It's a collection of his talks that he gave over like two or three years.

2:04:52.620 --> 2:04:54.160
 It's not very technical.

2:04:54.160 --> 2:04:55.160
 It's very approachable.

2:04:55.160 --> 2:05:00.480
 And some of it might be dated now because it's like 2015, 2016.

2:05:00.480 --> 2:05:05.500
 But I mean, it's great to hear a shout out for Andreas because he seems to be one of

2:05:05.500 --> 2:05:09.580
 the seminal figures to sort of make Bitcoin ideas accessible.

2:05:09.580 --> 2:05:10.580
 Andreas is the goat.

2:05:10.580 --> 2:05:11.580
 Andreas is the goat.

2:05:11.580 --> 2:05:17.700
 I know a lot of people will have issues with some of his like more recent work, but Andreas

2:05:17.700 --> 2:05:18.700
 is the goat.

2:05:18.700 --> 2:05:19.700
 Yeah.

2:05:19.700 --> 2:05:20.700
 He's the reason I'm in Bitcoin.

2:05:20.700 --> 2:05:21.700
 I mean, he's the reason I'm in Bitcoin.

2:05:21.700 --> 2:05:22.700
 Yeah.

2:05:22.700 --> 2:05:23.700
 That's fascinating.

2:05:23.700 --> 2:05:30.780
 And it's funny to watch the Bitcoin maximalist immune system also attacking him.

2:05:30.780 --> 2:05:33.700
 And this whole feedback mechanism is working together.

2:05:33.700 --> 2:05:34.700
 It's fascinating.

2:05:34.700 --> 2:05:37.940
 Well, I probably consider myself a maximalist, but I really like Andreas.

2:05:37.940 --> 2:05:40.420
 So I think there's room for nuance.

2:05:40.420 --> 2:05:42.100
 There's room for nuance in this world.

2:05:42.100 --> 2:05:43.940
 I'm glad to hear that.

2:05:43.940 --> 2:05:51.180
 If people are fascinated by your work, what is the way to get more of Alex?

2:05:51.180 --> 2:05:55.740
 So two years ago, I came together with seven other people from around the world and we

2:05:55.740 --> 2:05:57.540
 wrote a book in a book sprint.

2:05:57.540 --> 2:05:58.540
 We lived in a house for four days.

2:05:58.540 --> 2:05:59.540
 We wrote a book together.

2:05:59.540 --> 2:06:00.540
 It was really cool.

2:06:00.540 --> 2:06:03.180
 It was like a design sprint, but we did it in book format.

2:06:03.180 --> 2:06:09.940
 And my coauthors are from Nigeria, Venezuela, the Philippines, from former Soviet Union,

2:06:09.940 --> 2:06:10.980
 from all over.

2:06:10.980 --> 2:06:14.660
 And it's called The Little Bitcoin Book, and I'm still proud of it.

2:06:14.660 --> 2:06:15.660
 It's a hundred pages.

2:06:15.660 --> 2:06:18.700
 It's something you give to somebody who knows nothing about the topic.

2:06:18.700 --> 2:06:20.180
 And it's not a technical book.

2:06:20.180 --> 2:06:24.060
 It's about the sort of social political aspect of it.

2:06:24.060 --> 2:06:29.260
 Like why is it important for you, for your finances, for your freedom, for your future?

2:06:29.260 --> 2:06:32.460
 And we've translated it into like a lot of languages by now.

2:06:32.460 --> 2:06:37.900
 I think English, Spanish and Portuguese are for sale and littlebitcoinbook.com, you know,

2:06:37.900 --> 2:06:38.900
 you go buy it.

2:06:38.900 --> 2:06:46.660
 We've made it as a free PDF in Mandarin, Hindi, Punjab, Korean, Uyghur, which I was really

2:06:46.660 --> 2:06:49.540
 excited about, Arabic, Farsi.

2:06:49.540 --> 2:06:50.980
 And I mean, it spreads, man.

2:06:50.980 --> 2:06:51.980
 It's been really, really cool.

2:06:51.980 --> 2:06:54.500
 So I'm proud of that.

2:06:54.500 --> 2:07:00.040
 I also made a video that did very well for Reason magazine called Why is Bitcoin Protecting

2:07:00.040 --> 2:07:01.740
 Human Rights Around the World?

2:07:01.740 --> 2:07:02.740
 It's five minutes.

2:07:02.740 --> 2:07:08.140
 And it just, I feel like I tried to boil everything that I want to tell you into this five minute

2:07:08.140 --> 2:07:09.140
 video.

2:07:09.140 --> 2:07:10.140
 So there's that.

2:07:10.140 --> 2:07:11.540
 I would recommend that.

2:07:11.540 --> 2:07:17.820
 And then if you're interested in the why have governments not stopped it, which I think

2:07:17.820 --> 2:07:24.020
 is really intriguing, I wrote this long essay in Quillette in February called, you know,

2:07:24.020 --> 2:07:26.300
 why haven't governments banned Bitcoin?

2:07:26.300 --> 2:07:28.540
 And maybe that'll be a helpful guide to some folks.

2:07:28.540 --> 2:07:32.940
 Is this speaking to the Trojan horse idea that there's something enticing about it?

2:07:32.940 --> 2:07:34.800
 Yeah, at the end, it does get into that.

2:07:34.800 --> 2:07:39.100
 But it really also just kind of goes through technically, why is it hard to do a 51% attack?

2:07:39.100 --> 2:07:43.100
 Like if a government wanted to, could it really get all that equipment?

2:07:43.100 --> 2:07:45.940
 There's a semiconductor shortage, like it can't.

2:07:45.940 --> 2:07:49.380
 There's like certain things that stop governments from doing it.

2:07:49.380 --> 2:07:55.720
 And same thing with like this idea of a 6102, which would be based on the idea of the executive

2:07:55.720 --> 2:08:01.140
 order 6102, which is from 1933 when FDR made holding gold illegal in the United States.

2:08:01.140 --> 2:08:04.460
 The idea is that like banks would go around now with governments and try to like steal

2:08:04.460 --> 2:08:05.460
 everybody's Bitcoin.

2:08:05.460 --> 2:08:11.540
 Well, in Bitcoin we have like a practice called proof of keys day every January 3rd, you know,

2:08:11.540 --> 2:08:15.140
 which is coinciding with the launch of the Bitcoin blockchain, where we all like withdraw

2:08:15.140 --> 2:08:17.820
 our keys from exchanges and we'd be sovereign users.

2:08:17.820 --> 2:08:21.380
 What we are doing is we are preparing for a 6102 attack, which will one day probably

2:08:21.380 --> 2:08:22.380
 come, right?

2:08:22.380 --> 2:08:27.180
 So the essay just goes through all of the like possible attacks and it runs through

2:08:27.180 --> 2:08:30.540
 like the ones that happened, like the Chinese and Indian governments, the two largest governments

2:08:30.540 --> 2:08:35.060
 in the world, both tried to attack Bitcoin by banning their citizens from exchanging

2:08:35.060 --> 2:08:36.460
 fiat for Bitcoin.

2:08:36.460 --> 2:08:37.460
 It didn't work.

2:08:37.460 --> 2:08:38.560
 Interest instead exploded.

2:08:38.560 --> 2:08:45.140
 It's like the Barbra Streisand effect where, you know, by making something public and saying

2:08:45.140 --> 2:08:51.080
 you shouldn't do X, it actually increases attention about X a lot more, right?

2:08:51.080 --> 2:08:54.720
 So I think there's a lot of interesting game theory there that people would enjoy.

2:08:54.720 --> 2:09:00.780
 Do you think, are you seriously concerned about this kind of thing where the idea is

2:09:00.780 --> 2:09:06.140
 a sovereignty and that Bitcoin espouses would actually one day be tested?

2:09:06.140 --> 2:09:12.460
 Do you have like a legitimate concern because you said like one day very well might.

2:09:12.460 --> 2:09:15.340
 Do you think it might go down?

2:09:15.340 --> 2:09:21.260
 First of all, Bitcoin has been attacked again, many times and we talk about the, you spoke

2:09:21.260 --> 2:09:26.740
 about this with Nick Carter on your show, the sort of protocol wars or conflict or whatever,

2:09:26.740 --> 2:09:27.740
 right?

2:09:27.740 --> 2:09:30.780
 And Bitcoin almost died a whole bunch of times during that and ended up surviving.

2:09:30.780 --> 2:09:31.780
 Oh wow.

2:09:31.780 --> 2:09:32.940
 I didn't, I didn't know how bad the blocks at that point was.

2:09:32.940 --> 2:09:34.660
 Oh it got really bad.

2:09:34.660 --> 2:09:40.380
 It was, it was a sort of a very existential threat and Bitcoin survived and that's why

2:09:40.380 --> 2:09:47.540
 I'm so intrigued by it is that it basically survived an attack in an environment several

2:09:47.540 --> 2:09:51.240
 years ago when Bitcoin was much more vulnerable than it is today.

2:09:51.240 --> 2:09:55.860
 It survived an attack by a conglomeration of Chinese billionaires, Silicon Valley corporations

2:09:55.860 --> 2:10:00.540
 and a ton of people who owned the majority of the hash rate and all this infrastructure.

2:10:00.540 --> 2:10:05.220
 They had 83% of all the hash rate and they couldn't get what they wanted and that was

2:10:05.220 --> 2:10:06.220
 so intriguing to me.

2:10:06.220 --> 2:10:08.500
 Like why didn't it, why didn't it get killed?

2:10:08.500 --> 2:10:13.140
 So as Nick said, I think you should read The Block Size War, which is a book on that you

2:10:13.140 --> 2:10:15.380
 can get on Amazon by Jonathan Beer.

2:10:15.380 --> 2:10:21.620
 Really good, kind of like really important to understand the, the, the, the scaling conflict

2:10:21.620 --> 2:10:24.620
 and the visions over the different visions of what Bitcoin should be.

2:10:24.620 --> 2:10:27.940
 And you know, again, people like me believe it should be a freedom tool, not like a payments

2:10:27.940 --> 2:10:30.060
 technology for retail.

2:10:30.060 --> 2:10:33.580
 And I'm just, I'm glad it worked out the way it did because it almost didn't.

2:10:33.580 --> 2:10:38.440
 Do you think a human's civilization will destroy itself?

2:10:38.440 --> 2:10:46.660
 So if we think about all the threats facing human civilization, nuclear war, natural or

2:10:46.660 --> 2:10:52.000
 engineer pandemics, you know, we talk about human rights violations.

2:10:52.000 --> 2:11:00.220
 We talk about authoritarian governments taking control of the money supply, but do you have

2:11:00.220 --> 2:11:04.180
 grander concerns for the future of human civilization?

2:11:04.180 --> 2:11:07.100
 Do you have hope for us becoming a multi planetary species?

2:11:07.100 --> 2:11:11.640
 Yeah, I mean, I, I guess longterm we'd want to decentralize, right?

2:11:11.640 --> 2:11:16.620
 We don't want a single point of failure in the earth is a single point of failure.

2:11:16.620 --> 2:11:21.200
 But no, I mean, you look at all this kind of like space fiction and I mean, who would

2:11:21.200 --> 2:11:22.500
 want to live on Mars, man?

2:11:22.500 --> 2:11:23.500
 It's like a fricking desert.

2:11:23.500 --> 2:11:24.860
 I mean, the earth is so beautiful.

2:11:24.860 --> 2:11:26.580
 I hope we can save it.

2:11:26.580 --> 2:11:31.020
 You know, it's just so gorgeous when you look at the earth compared to any other like exoplanet

2:11:31.020 --> 2:11:36.140
 or whatever you look at it, I mean, the earth is so spectacular and wondrous and singular.

2:11:36.140 --> 2:11:39.740
 I think we got to do everything we can to save it here.

2:11:39.740 --> 2:11:40.740
 That's funny.

2:11:40.740 --> 2:11:46.600
 I mean, I'm sure a lot of people would have said that about Europe before the explorers

2:11:46.600 --> 2:11:52.020
 ventured out Columbus and the rest out into the unknown.

2:11:52.020 --> 2:11:54.620
 The thing about human nature is that we are explorers too.

2:11:54.620 --> 2:11:55.620
 We are.

2:11:55.620 --> 2:12:02.020
 Some small fraction of us are insane enough to explore in the most dangerous grounds and

2:12:02.020 --> 2:12:06.280
 I'm pretty sure there's quite a few people that would love to take the first step on

2:12:06.280 --> 2:12:11.980
 Mars, the first few steps on Mars in the harshest of environments, even when the odds of survival

2:12:11.980 --> 2:12:14.180
 extremely low.

2:12:14.180 --> 2:12:19.420
 And I'm thankful for those people because I sit back and drink my vodka back here on

2:12:19.420 --> 2:12:26.020
 earth and enjoy good friendships because I think ultimately that step to Mars is going

2:12:26.020 --> 2:12:34.220
 to be a first step into exploring and colonizing the rest of the galaxy.

2:12:34.220 --> 2:12:42.740
 Mars might be a harsh environment, but maybe space is not like other planets, other exoplanets,

2:12:42.740 --> 2:12:48.380
 but also forget planets, just creating colonies that flow about in space.

2:12:48.380 --> 2:12:51.780
 There's exciting technologies that are yet to be discovered, yet to be engineered and

2:12:51.780 --> 2:12:56.820
 built that I think require that first painful step.

2:12:56.820 --> 2:13:00.620
 The journey of a thousand miles starts with one step and I think Mars is that first step.

2:13:00.620 --> 2:13:06.780
 Yeah, no, I was born the day before the Challenger blew up and it was always so tragic for me

2:13:06.780 --> 2:13:11.700
 to look back on that because that really altered our arc in terms of space exploration.

2:13:11.700 --> 2:13:12.700
 That had not happened.

2:13:12.700 --> 2:13:17.580
 We'd be on a very different arc and I do respect and admire people pushing for exploration,

2:13:17.580 --> 2:13:24.540
 but at the same time, I just want to recognize that we know how unique Earth is and I do

2:13:24.540 --> 2:13:30.060
 think we got to do everything we can to protect it.

2:13:30.060 --> 2:13:33.140
 But I think you've already answered the question if we're going to destroy ourselves.

2:13:33.140 --> 2:13:35.860
 Oh, yeah, I guess.

2:13:35.860 --> 2:13:36.860
 Are you hopeful?

2:13:36.860 --> 2:13:38.140
 Okay, fine.

2:13:38.140 --> 2:13:45.340
 If we do not decentralize properly out into different physical spaces, probably, I guess,

2:13:45.340 --> 2:13:46.340
 yeah.

2:13:46.340 --> 2:13:53.220
 I mean, do you have concerns that are immediately facing you, so not in terms of the injustices

2:13:53.220 --> 2:13:55.020
 on the world, but nuclear war?

2:13:55.020 --> 2:13:58.980
 Yeah, look, I'm a lot more concerned about what's happening right now.

2:13:58.980 --> 2:14:01.860
 Like, what is destroying ourselves?

2:14:01.860 --> 2:14:07.700
 If you were to go and see what's happening in Xinjiang or North Korea right now or Eritrea,

2:14:07.700 --> 2:14:10.420
 that is destroying ourselves and it's already happened.

2:14:10.420 --> 2:14:15.220
 So I guess the end, that's why I said, yes, I mean, if you don't decentralize and power

2:14:15.220 --> 2:14:20.900
 is completely under one person, life is destroyed as we know it.

2:14:20.900 --> 2:14:27.460
 And you don't have to go into science fiction to know what a totalitarian hellscape dystopia

2:14:27.460 --> 2:14:28.460
 is.

2:14:28.460 --> 2:14:33.660
 There's several that exist already and let's try to help those people at the same time

2:14:33.660 --> 2:14:37.900
 as we're trying to push out into space would be my counter, I guess.

2:14:37.900 --> 2:14:39.520
 Yeah, I agree with you.

2:14:39.520 --> 2:14:43.220
 In my mind, destruction and suffering are next door neighbors.

2:14:43.220 --> 2:14:46.300
 So we don't need to destroy all of human civilization.

2:14:46.300 --> 2:14:53.060
 If much, a large fraction of it lives in conditions that we would equate to suffering, that's

2:14:53.060 --> 2:14:55.980
 not a good world.

2:14:55.980 --> 2:15:01.460
 Is there advice that you would give to young people today about life, about career, about

2:15:01.460 --> 2:15:10.100
 how they can help a world where 53% are living under authoritarian governments, but in general,

2:15:10.100 --> 2:15:15.020
 a world that's full of injustice, but also full of opportunity?

2:15:15.020 --> 2:15:19.980
 Just thinking about my own upbringing, I went to a public school here and we never learned

2:15:19.980 --> 2:15:21.540
 about money.

2:15:21.540 --> 2:15:24.940
 It was never part of our curriculum.

2:15:24.940 --> 2:15:27.780
 Even personal finances was not part of our curriculum.

2:15:27.780 --> 2:15:31.940
 You could take like an optional course to learn about like business or something.

2:15:31.940 --> 2:15:38.020
 And I think that that would be really valuable as a young person or as a teenager to start

2:15:38.020 --> 2:15:43.300
 incorporating into your children's lives is like a curiosity about what is money, I think

2:15:43.300 --> 2:15:47.500
 would be very healthy, regardless of what path that takes them down.

2:15:47.500 --> 2:15:51.000
 Because we don't think about it enough, either from an administrative sort of personal finance

2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:57.500
 thing about like responsibility, or more fundamentally, like, what is it and who creates it?

2:15:57.500 --> 2:15:58.960
 Where did it come from?

2:15:58.960 --> 2:16:00.260
 Both of those things are very important.

2:16:00.260 --> 2:16:04.540
 So my advice to a young person would be to get to the point where you feel like you can

2:16:04.540 --> 2:16:07.620
 answer the question, what is money?

2:16:07.620 --> 2:16:13.140
 So you ultimately see money as a kind of power and freedom and a mechanism of suffering.

2:16:13.140 --> 2:16:15.420
 It is so core to everything.

2:16:15.420 --> 2:16:20.940
 The United States, whether you want to call it the Pax Americana, the Empire, the hyperpower,

2:16:20.940 --> 2:16:24.340
 whatever you want to call this moment in time where the US is dominant around the world,

2:16:24.340 --> 2:16:30.580
 it is because of the fact that we have this petrodollar system, where we are able to force

2:16:30.580 --> 2:16:36.240
 the Saudis and other oil producing nations to sell their oil in dollars.

2:16:36.240 --> 2:16:40.440
 That is really inescapable, inseparable from our power.

2:16:40.440 --> 2:16:42.340
 And that's very rarely talked about.

2:16:42.340 --> 2:16:44.160
 And it's very important to understand.

2:16:44.160 --> 2:16:47.980
 So yeah, if young people could start thinking about that stuff, it'd be good.

2:16:47.980 --> 2:16:52.660
 I remember being, it sounds silly to say, but I remember being really uncomfortable

2:16:52.660 --> 2:16:58.380
 that I was dependent on my parents at a young age for like financial.

2:16:58.380 --> 2:17:01.580
 You need to be 18 to have a bank account or whatever.

2:17:01.580 --> 2:17:05.520
 One of the people that we supported at Ahrefs through our, we do software development funding

2:17:05.520 --> 2:17:08.060
 for people in Bitcoin, open source projects.

2:17:08.060 --> 2:17:11.940
 And one of the guys we funded is this very young, smart sort of prodigy.

2:17:11.940 --> 2:17:12.940
 He's like 17.

2:17:12.940 --> 2:17:16.300
 But one of the reasons he got into Bitcoin was because he wanted to have control of his

2:17:16.300 --> 2:17:17.300
 money when he was like 14.

2:17:17.300 --> 2:17:22.960
 I mean, if you think in history, people who invented all kinds of incredible contributions

2:17:22.960 --> 2:17:27.540
 to science or math, I mean, a lot of them did it before they were 15.

2:17:27.540 --> 2:17:31.680
 So think about that maturity that is capable and possible in many people.

2:17:31.680 --> 2:17:36.940
 Like I've participated in some of the years ago, some of the sort of selection processes

2:17:36.940 --> 2:17:39.060
 for like the Teal fellowship, which is like really amazing.

2:17:39.060 --> 2:17:42.700
 Like these people who are 14, 15, 16, who don't need to go to college, they're already

2:17:42.700 --> 2:17:46.460
 like so smart, they can figure it out, but they wouldn't be allowed to have a bank account.

2:17:46.460 --> 2:17:48.580
 So hey, that's kind of cool.

2:17:48.580 --> 2:17:52.460
 Like now you have a permissionless money, you can open up yourself without permission

2:17:52.460 --> 2:17:53.460
 from your parents.

2:17:53.460 --> 2:17:54.460
 That's kind of cool.

2:17:54.460 --> 2:17:55.460
 Yeah.

2:17:55.460 --> 2:17:56.460
 That's fascinating to me.

2:17:56.460 --> 2:18:06.340
 I feel like I would have loved my parents more if I had freedom to fully realize myself,

2:18:06.340 --> 2:18:11.660
 because I felt like I was a little bit trapped by, I don't know, it's not explicit, right?

2:18:11.660 --> 2:18:17.420
 It's a little bit, it's like a subtle push that you're somehow dependent on them.

2:18:17.420 --> 2:18:23.260
 I mean, part of that is like, I think it actually very much has to do not talking about money.

2:18:23.260 --> 2:18:26.660
 Like what does it take to operate as an individual entity in this world?

2:18:26.660 --> 2:18:31.580
 Like knowing that when you're 10 years old, knowing that when you're very young, so that

2:18:31.580 --> 2:18:39.100
 you've, then you see the, how amazing it is to have the support of your parents until

2:18:39.100 --> 2:18:40.100
 you're 18.

2:18:40.100 --> 2:18:47.700
 Like have that freedom, have the freedom to appreciate the value your parents bring.

2:18:47.700 --> 2:18:55.780
 And at the same time, the freedom to leave in some capacity to carve your own path.

2:18:55.780 --> 2:19:00.940
 I mean, like just all of that, I think for weirdos like me, especially because I was

2:19:00.940 --> 2:19:06.620
 a very nontraditional path that I think it would be very empowering and certainly would

2:19:06.620 --> 2:19:08.060
 be empowering in the third world.

2:19:08.060 --> 2:19:09.060
 Not just weirdos like you.

2:19:09.060 --> 2:19:10.060
 Yeah.

2:19:10.060 --> 2:19:13.700
 I was going to mention one of the people I got who taught me about Bitcoin, her name

2:19:13.700 --> 2:19:14.700
 is Roya Mapoob.

2:19:14.700 --> 2:19:20.700
 She's an Afghan technology CEO, and in 2013 she started paying her employees in Bitcoin

2:19:20.700 --> 2:19:24.840
 because they were not allowed to open bank accounts, the women that worked for her.

2:19:24.840 --> 2:19:29.900
 She started the country's first female, like all female software company.

2:19:29.900 --> 2:19:33.260
 And if they brought cash home, their like husbands or uncles or brothers would steal

2:19:33.260 --> 2:19:34.260
 it from them.

2:19:34.260 --> 2:19:37.000
 There's like a power patriarchal dominance thing going on.

2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:41.680
 But they had phones and she was able to pay them in Bitcoin and no one knew, and it gave

2:19:41.680 --> 2:19:42.820
 them that power.

2:19:42.820 --> 2:19:47.340
 And that's always stuck in my mind as a very interesting effect of this kind of thing of

2:19:47.340 --> 2:19:50.420
 permissionless money, like that it can be an empowerment tool.

2:19:50.420 --> 2:19:51.420
 So absolutely.

2:19:51.420 --> 2:20:00.600
 So in your own personal life, where did the deep concern for the suffering in the world

2:20:00.600 --> 2:20:02.500
 come from?

2:20:02.500 --> 2:20:04.740
 Where was that born?

2:20:04.740 --> 2:20:09.940
 I was going to be an engineer actually, and then in 2003 we invaded Iraq and I got very

2:20:09.940 --> 2:20:16.320
 interested in why we did that as a nation and I switched my focus of study to like international

2:20:16.320 --> 2:20:21.700
 relations and that's how I kind of went down the kind of political science democracy rabbit

2:20:21.700 --> 2:20:24.900
 hole and ended up getting a job at the human rights foundation.

2:20:24.900 --> 2:20:28.620
 So that I'm a very much a child of like 9 11 and the Iraq war.

2:20:28.620 --> 2:20:32.540
 Those are the two really formative events for me personally.

2:20:32.540 --> 2:20:33.780
 Can you break that apart a little bit?

2:20:33.780 --> 2:20:44.100
 Like what illusion about this world was broken apart by the invasion of Iraq?

2:20:44.100 --> 2:20:48.860
 Well I think first of all, 9 11 just shifted the world dynamics completely from a focus

2:20:48.860 --> 2:20:56.620
 on big power politics between the US, Russia and China to this new threat of Islamic terror.

2:20:56.620 --> 2:21:01.000
 And a lot of it we learned later, a lot of the things we did, we were manufactured, choreographed,

2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:03.380
 like there were no WMDs in Iraq.

2:21:03.380 --> 2:21:08.400
 Like the reason our rulers said we needed to invade and destroy this country was a lie.

2:21:08.400 --> 2:21:10.860
 And that I think has really been forgotten.

2:21:10.860 --> 2:21:15.100
 Like I think a lot of like the Zoomers like today don't really know a lot about that time

2:21:15.100 --> 2:21:16.100
 period.

2:21:16.100 --> 2:21:17.100
 I mean it's pretty crazy.

2:21:17.100 --> 2:21:23.220
 Unanimously, I mean Democrat, Republican, like Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, like and

2:21:23.220 --> 2:21:30.100
 the Republicans, everybody wanted to invade this country and it's a confusing time.

2:21:30.100 --> 2:21:34.020
 There's a really good book by Ian McEwen called Saturday, a fiction book that takes place

2:21:34.020 --> 2:21:39.200
 during I think 2003 and it's one day in the life of the doctor in London.

2:21:39.200 --> 2:21:44.260
 It's really good though to revisit this time because he has two characters, he has characters

2:21:44.260 --> 2:21:47.900
 in the book, one of whom is very pro war and one of them is very against war.

2:21:47.900 --> 2:21:51.300
 Basically he, the father himself is pro war and his son is against it and they have all

2:21:51.300 --> 2:21:52.300
 these debates.

2:21:52.300 --> 2:21:56.860
 And it's nice to go back to revisit but that time was, it's really crazy and it really

2:21:56.860 --> 2:22:02.060
 showed you that like the media could be captured into like helping promote this idea of like

2:22:02.060 --> 2:22:03.840
 invading another country.

2:22:03.840 --> 2:22:08.100
 So I was very curious about why we did it and like who was pulling the strings and what

2:22:08.100 --> 2:22:10.060
 are the reasons that we went.

2:22:10.060 --> 2:22:13.660
 And what's really interesting is that like I took all these courses on and interviewed

2:22:13.660 --> 2:22:18.420
 all these decision makers, whether they were like neocons or whatever, different people

2:22:18.420 --> 2:22:19.420
 who were involved.

2:22:19.420 --> 2:22:24.300
 And the whole like dollar reserve currency thing like really never came up until like

2:22:24.300 --> 2:22:27.320
 I learned about it more recently because of Bitcoin.

2:22:27.320 --> 2:22:30.940
 And today when I look back, it seems kind of obvious that the reason we invaded Iraq

2:22:30.940 --> 2:22:35.060
 was because Saddam Hussein wanted to sell oil in euros.

2:22:35.060 --> 2:22:39.300
 It seems really obvious when you go back and look at the chronology of it and we were like,

2:22:39.300 --> 2:22:43.520
 no, we actually don't want you to sell dollars in euros because that would threaten the dollar.

2:22:43.520 --> 2:22:45.820
 So we're going to invade you and then you're not going to do it and then no one else is

2:22:45.820 --> 2:22:50.060
 going to like sell dollars in euros, just oil in euros, right?

2:22:50.060 --> 2:22:55.060
 I guess you could say the same thing about Qaddafi, but we as a nation have very much

2:22:55.060 --> 2:22:57.660
 protected our reserve currency, let's put it that way.

2:22:57.660 --> 2:23:01.700
 Yeah, actually one of the things that Bitcoin community has motivated me to do is to look

2:23:01.700 --> 2:23:07.460
 back to the histories that I have studied myself from just even the two world wars,

2:23:07.460 --> 2:23:13.220
 the history of the 20th century from a perspective of the monetary system of money.

2:23:13.220 --> 2:23:14.660
 And it's interesting.

2:23:14.660 --> 2:23:17.580
 It's interesting to look at human history in the context of money.

2:23:17.580 --> 2:23:21.940
 Can't we be patriotic and be pro America, but like not want the petrodollar?

2:23:21.940 --> 2:23:24.100
 Like I should be proud of my country.

2:23:24.100 --> 2:23:26.180
 Why do we need to be propping up the Saudis?

2:23:26.180 --> 2:23:30.020
 Why do we need to be, you know, threatening to invade other countries if they sell their

2:23:30.020 --> 2:23:31.620
 oil for a different currency?

2:23:31.620 --> 2:23:36.100
 I think we can be just as powerful as we are today, if not more powerful in a Bitcoin world.

2:23:36.100 --> 2:23:39.340
 If you think about the infrastructure Americans are building, all the innovations we're building,

2:23:39.340 --> 2:23:43.140
 all the wealth we have, I think we'll be fine, better than fine.

2:23:43.140 --> 2:23:46.100
 And we won't have these horrible negative externalities.

2:23:46.100 --> 2:23:49.740
 It's really an optimistic vision for the future.

2:23:49.740 --> 2:23:56.580
 I thought we learned the lesson of 9 11 and the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan.

2:23:56.580 --> 2:24:01.020
 But we're leaving and you know, Biden announced we're leaving Afghanistan this year, 20 years

2:24:01.020 --> 2:24:02.020
 for what?

2:24:02.020 --> 2:24:03.500
 The Taliban are going to take over.

2:24:03.500 --> 2:24:08.380
 Well, I mean, that's at least a good, the longest war, right?

2:24:08.380 --> 2:24:09.640
 The forever wars.

2:24:09.640 --> 2:24:17.300
 I feel like the past 20 years or whatever it is, 18 years, 19 years, we've been very

2:24:17.300 --> 2:24:24.900
 skeptical about invading other countries, about, we've been skeptical about military

2:24:24.900 --> 2:24:27.460
 intervention in other nations.

2:24:27.460 --> 2:24:33.420
 Well, our leaders certainly haven't, we have like seven active wars right now, and neither

2:24:33.420 --> 2:24:37.900
 the Russians and the Chinese, everybody's starting to invade everybody else.

2:24:37.900 --> 2:24:42.940
 I mean, so yes, but I meant to a degree that I was worried about like conflicts with, hot

2:24:42.940 --> 2:24:47.900
 conflicts with Iran, with North Korea, those kinds of things.

2:24:47.900 --> 2:24:54.660
 That there was not as much war mongering as I was afraid about.

2:24:54.660 --> 2:24:56.020
 But yes, you're absolutely right.

2:24:56.020 --> 2:25:01.200
 We're still, there's a big presence by the United States and other nations and across

2:25:01.200 --> 2:25:03.140
 the world that's military.

2:25:03.140 --> 2:25:11.660
 The military industrial complex is a thing that has huge detrimental ripple effects throughout

2:25:11.660 --> 2:25:13.220
 the entirety of our governments.

2:25:13.220 --> 2:25:14.220
 Yeah.

2:25:14.220 --> 2:25:20.800
 So the big question is how do we prevent the rise of this like authoritarian surveillance

2:25:20.800 --> 2:25:26.060
 state in China while at the same time kind of diffusing the military industrial complex

2:25:26.060 --> 2:25:27.340
 on our side?

2:25:27.340 --> 2:25:29.820
 That to me is like the biggest challenge of our time.

2:25:29.820 --> 2:25:32.140
 I don't have the answer, but we should keep digging.

2:25:32.140 --> 2:25:33.140
 Yeah.

2:25:33.140 --> 2:25:36.900
 I believe there's technological innovations.

2:25:36.900 --> 2:25:40.740
 You're suggesting that perhaps one of the technological innovations like is Bitcoin.

2:25:40.740 --> 2:25:42.020
 It's a big part of it.

2:25:42.020 --> 2:25:43.020
 Yeah.

2:25:43.020 --> 2:25:47.300
 On the money side, I think the information side, there's innovations that are open, that's

2:25:47.300 --> 2:25:48.460
 possible.

2:25:48.460 --> 2:25:50.900
 And the political side, I'm the most skeptical about.

2:25:50.900 --> 2:25:58.020
 I just feel like there's, without hot wars that we don't seem to make any kind of progress.

2:25:58.020 --> 2:26:04.980
 Cities just grow, corruption and greed grow and human nature does not do well in the political

2:26:04.980 --> 2:26:05.980
 arena.

2:26:05.980 --> 2:26:11.420
 So I hope technology can outpace the darker sides of human nature.

2:26:11.420 --> 2:26:17.620
 So you're busy fighting the demons, the darkness that's out there, but looking in the mirror,

2:26:17.620 --> 2:26:19.100
 you're a finite being.

2:26:19.100 --> 2:26:24.380
 Unfortunately this ride ends for you pretty soon.

2:26:24.380 --> 2:26:32.340
 Do you ever ask yourself about the meaning at all of why the hell us descendants of apes

2:26:32.340 --> 2:26:39.140
 are even on this thing, striving so hard to make a better world for ourselves?

2:26:39.140 --> 2:26:41.700
 I don't often zoom out that much.

2:26:41.700 --> 2:26:43.820
 I feel like my day job is pretty interesting.

2:26:43.820 --> 2:26:49.740
 It keeps me very engaged with all the stuff we've been talking about.

2:26:49.740 --> 2:26:58.860
 As far as the meaning of life though, it seems quite clear that we do have the possibility

2:26:58.860 --> 2:27:06.380
 as a species to create these beautiful communities and constructs and to share an exploration

2:27:06.380 --> 2:27:14.260
 of the world together that is often marred by cold realities that we've discussed.

2:27:14.260 --> 2:27:22.740
 But I do feel like in a way that the meaning of life is that pursuit, of course biologically

2:27:22.740 --> 2:27:31.780
 is to spread our species, but also to pursue knowledge and science and innovation and freedom

2:27:31.780 --> 2:27:33.380
 most importantly.

2:27:33.380 --> 2:27:37.820
 I think freedom has to guide us or else we end up with prison camps.

2:27:37.820 --> 2:27:40.900
 If we don't let freedom guide us, we end up with the prison camps.

2:27:40.900 --> 2:27:45.940
 So we need to have scientific innovation and adventurism and colonization of the stars,

2:27:45.940 --> 2:27:48.460
 but without the slavery and without the prison camps.

2:27:48.460 --> 2:27:49.700
 I think that's so key.

2:27:49.700 --> 2:27:55.500
 There's something about the creation of beauty that seems fundamental to human nature and

2:27:55.500 --> 2:28:04.660
 what seems beautiful is these communities that don't have suffering, they don't have

2:28:04.660 --> 2:28:05.660
 injustice.

2:28:05.660 --> 2:28:09.500
 And we have some kind of inner sense of what is injustice.

2:28:09.500 --> 2:28:14.500
 I don't know, like some of the human rights that you've mentioned earlier, they're just

2:28:14.500 --> 2:28:21.500
 philosophical constructs, but they're also seem to be somehow deeply in us too.

2:28:21.500 --> 2:28:24.380
 We have a sense of what is right and what is wrong.

2:28:24.380 --> 2:28:28.140
 It's not just a kind of illusion that we've all agreed on.

2:28:28.140 --> 2:28:31.620
 Yeah, arbitrary power, torture, executions.

2:28:31.620 --> 2:28:32.620
 We know these things are wrong.

2:28:32.620 --> 2:28:34.540
 I mean, we know they're wrong.

2:28:34.540 --> 2:28:38.220
 We don't have to read a book to know that.

2:28:38.220 --> 2:28:40.780
 But you do need to...

2:28:40.780 --> 2:28:41.780
 People can get brainwashed.

2:28:41.780 --> 2:28:46.060
 I mean, you talk to people who've grown up in North Korea, they don't know any better.

2:28:46.060 --> 2:28:48.740
 They don't know what's going on in the outside world.

2:28:48.740 --> 2:28:51.260
 So they've never experienced anything differently.

2:28:51.260 --> 2:28:56.260
 So that's why, look, technology can play a big role here in terms of the meaning of it

2:28:56.260 --> 2:28:57.260
 all.

2:28:57.260 --> 2:29:01.260
 It can really help emancipate, liberate people, at least so that they can make their own choices

2:29:01.260 --> 2:29:04.340
 about what to do, at least so that we're on a level playing field.

2:29:04.340 --> 2:29:10.860
 So technologies like the internet and Bitcoin, they can at least give you the option to do

2:29:10.860 --> 2:29:14.020
 things your own way on your own terms.

2:29:14.020 --> 2:29:17.060
 And then from there, we'll see.

2:29:17.060 --> 2:29:22.940
 I think it's important that we have design choices where we can have a little more say

2:29:22.940 --> 2:29:26.380
 and not everything be preprogrammed for us.

2:29:26.380 --> 2:29:28.500
 That would be very disappointing.

2:29:28.500 --> 2:29:34.400
 So I mean, the open web and encryption in Bitcoin, these are things that help prevent

2:29:34.400 --> 2:29:40.220
 social engineering and that promote more freedom and more possibilities, honestly, and more

2:29:40.220 --> 2:29:43.660
 entrepreneurship and more creativity and more scientific inquiry.

2:29:43.660 --> 2:29:47.820
 I mean, think about the people who tried to shut down scientific inquiry 500, 600 years

2:29:47.820 --> 2:29:54.220
 ago or whatever that were trying to say the earth was the center of everything and they

2:29:54.220 --> 2:29:55.220
 were wrong.

2:29:55.220 --> 2:29:59.580
 And then all these conservative religious types throughout history have always said

2:29:59.580 --> 2:30:05.060
 that there's no value in science and there's no value in technology and they've been wrong

2:30:05.060 --> 2:30:06.060
 the whole time.

2:30:06.060 --> 2:30:07.940
 So let's continue pushing here.

2:30:07.940 --> 2:30:09.900
 Let's continue pushing.

2:30:09.900 --> 2:30:15.300
 It's kind of scary to me sometimes, humbling, beautiful, but also scary to think of.

2:30:15.300 --> 2:30:20.500
 You mentioned North Korea, people are kind of living in ignorance.

2:30:20.500 --> 2:30:24.620
 It's scary to me to think about how much ignorance there is in the world today, like how little

2:30:24.620 --> 2:30:30.260
 I know personally, or us as a human civilization knows there's yet to be discovered to that

2:30:30.260 --> 2:30:31.260
 very...

2:30:31.260 --> 2:30:32.780
 Well, there's a difference between laziness and ignorance, right?

2:30:32.780 --> 2:30:38.140
 So I would be lazy if I didn't take advantage of the internet, right?

2:30:38.140 --> 2:30:40.140
 Someone in North Korea doesn't have the option.

2:30:40.140 --> 2:30:41.140
 They don't have the option.

2:30:41.140 --> 2:30:43.040
 There's literally no way for them to access the internet.

2:30:43.040 --> 2:30:49.220
 So there's kind of like social laziness that philosophers have warned about forever that

2:30:49.220 --> 2:30:55.620
 we basically become sheep, okay, and then there's actual like brainwashing and censorship that's

2:30:55.620 --> 2:31:01.780
 possible like by closing off your population and keeping them off like the internet, right?

2:31:01.780 --> 2:31:03.580
 So I think these are two very different concepts.

2:31:03.580 --> 2:31:04.580
 Absolutely.

2:31:04.580 --> 2:31:10.460
 But I also mean just like not even laziness, but cognitive limitations and just historical

2:31:10.460 --> 2:31:17.820
 scientific limitations like, you know, we're a very young species, like all of the exciting

2:31:17.820 --> 2:31:22.340
 stuff we've been talking about have happened on the scale of decades, maybe centuries.

2:31:22.340 --> 2:31:26.740
 We're very young and all the cool stuff we've come up with and it's just humbling to think

2:31:26.740 --> 2:31:32.060
 about how little we know, but you're right that, you know, ultimately having the freedom

2:31:32.060 --> 2:31:38.200
 to keep exploring, keep venturing out, even if we later discover that a lot of the stuff

2:31:38.200 --> 2:31:44.000
 we've been doing now is ethically horrible.

2:31:44.000 --> 2:31:48.300
 If you think about animals or I think about robots a lot, the kind of things we might

2:31:48.300 --> 2:31:55.920
 be doing to other consciousnesses that are here on earth might be, we might see as atrocities

2:31:55.920 --> 2:32:00.300
 later on, but ultimately you have to have the freedom to explore those kinds of ideas

2:32:00.300 --> 2:32:04.660
 and without that freedom, you don't even get the chance to be lazy.

2:32:04.660 --> 2:32:05.660
 Yeah.

2:32:05.660 --> 2:32:08.760
 I mean, look, don't be a sheep.

2:32:08.760 --> 2:32:09.760
 It's easy to be a sheep.

2:32:09.760 --> 2:32:10.760
 No offense to sheep.

2:32:10.760 --> 2:32:12.060
 And there's some practical things, man.

2:32:12.060 --> 2:32:18.220
 Get on signal, start encrypting your messages, take control over your privacy.

2:32:18.220 --> 2:32:20.740
 The media doesn't want you to, but check out Bitcoin.

2:32:20.740 --> 2:32:22.140
 You can be your own bank.

2:32:22.140 --> 2:32:25.200
 You can transact with people around the world and no one can stop you.

2:32:25.200 --> 2:32:32.180
 This can put a stop to a lot of arbitrary power and a lot of human rights violations.

2:32:32.180 --> 2:32:38.580
 Don't use WeChat, question more, research what's happening in Xinjiang, I mean, learn

2:32:38.580 --> 2:32:43.420
 about what's happening in the genocide in that country and let's think about how we

2:32:43.420 --> 2:32:48.380
 can build our societies so that we never have that kind of power concentration ever again.

2:32:48.380 --> 2:32:49.820
 Each of us can make a difference.

2:32:49.820 --> 2:32:51.900
 Alex, it's a huge honor to talk to you.

2:32:51.900 --> 2:32:53.140
 I've been a fan of your work.

2:32:53.140 --> 2:32:57.940
 A lot of people spoke really highly of you as one of the beacons of hope for our human

2:32:57.940 --> 2:32:58.940
 civilization.

2:32:58.940 --> 2:33:01.500
 So I'm really glad we got a chance to talk.

2:33:01.500 --> 2:33:03.020
 Thank you for wasting all this time with me today.

2:33:03.020 --> 2:33:04.020
 It's been an honor.

2:33:04.020 --> 2:33:05.020
 Thanks man.

2:33:05.020 --> 2:33:06.260
 A lot of fun.

2:33:06.260 --> 2:33:09.260
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Alex Glastine.

2:33:09.260 --> 2:33:13.300
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:33:13.300 --> 2:33:18.380
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Alice Walker.

2:33:18.380 --> 2:33:24.900
 The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.

2:33:24.900 --> 2:33:36.540
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
