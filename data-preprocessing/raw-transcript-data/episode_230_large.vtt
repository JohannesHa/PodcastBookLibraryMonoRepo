00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
 The following is a conversation with Kelsey Sharon, Canadian Forces veteran, artillery

00:05.200 --> 00:11.960
 gunner who served in Afghanistan at 18 years old and came home with severe PTSD.

00:11.960 --> 00:16.800
 She went on to found Brass in Unity which creates unique jewellery, large part of the

00:16.800 --> 00:23.160
 proceeds from which go to help rehabilitate the lives, limbs and mental health of veterans

00:23.160 --> 00:25.040
 and first responders.

00:25.040 --> 00:30.160
 She has a big personality, big heart and an intense passion for life.

00:30.160 --> 00:35.400
 So when our paths happened to cross, I knew we needed to talk.

00:35.400 --> 00:40.880
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, to support it please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:40.880 --> 00:45.520
 And now here's my conversation with Kelsey Sharon.

00:45.520 --> 00:49.560
 You mentioned that studying history had a big impact on you and that your grandfather

00:49.560 --> 00:52.120
 was a World War II vet.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.960
 So people that have gone through World War II, in my family too, they don't seem to talk

00:55.960 --> 00:56.960
 about it much.

00:56.960 --> 01:00.520
 Like the worse the tragedy, the less they talk about it.

01:00.520 --> 01:06.140
 I mean it's understandable, I can respect that, but I don't think people fully understood

01:06.140 --> 01:13.920
 the value in human stories over time and sharing that, that certain civilizations don't have

01:13.920 --> 01:15.420
 written language.

01:15.420 --> 01:21.540
 The value in that being passed down is extraordinary, but we didn't really have that with the World

01:21.540 --> 01:23.160
 War II vets it seems like.

01:23.160 --> 01:27.240
 Well, they kind of want to protect you from the pain.

01:27.240 --> 01:32.360
 My grandmother went through Holland and Moore, which is the Ukrainian starvation of millions

01:32.360 --> 01:39.800
 of people, and then obviously went through World War II with the Nazi occupation.

01:39.800 --> 01:46.440
 And same on the grandfather's side who, on my dad's side, grandfather fought in World

01:46.440 --> 01:47.440
 War II.

01:47.440 --> 01:53.280
 So they seem to not want to talk about those experiences to protect you from the suffering,

01:53.280 --> 01:59.540
 to protect you from the evil that they've experienced, which is sad because the lessons

01:59.540 --> 02:02.840
 from that history are not then propagated through you.

02:02.840 --> 02:07.320
 And also there's something about the strength you carry with you knowing that that's in

02:07.320 --> 02:08.320
 your blood.

02:08.320 --> 02:11.920
 Those great heroes are in your blood and that's suffering, overcoming that suffering is in

02:11.920 --> 02:12.920
 your blood.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.160
 I would argue that's exactly correct.

02:15.160 --> 02:20.760
 If you have someone you know that comes from your lineage that has done something super

02:20.760 --> 02:26.000
 gnarly, that's just been a badass and in so many different ways, you want to know about

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
 that person.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.160
 You have that person's blood in you.

02:28.160 --> 02:32.680
 That's important to acknowledge and when that isn't shared, I feel like it's just a detriment

02:32.680 --> 02:33.680
 to that individual.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.960
 What do you make of World War II?

02:36.960 --> 02:43.180
 In terms of history, do you think about those kinds of wars where two times more civilians

02:43.180 --> 02:47.680
 died than the number of military personnel?

02:47.680 --> 02:54.040
 So most of the war is basically just the death of civilians and the invasion of homes, the

02:54.040 --> 02:57.080
 burning of homes, the bombing of homes, all of that.

02:57.080 --> 03:06.720
 World War II for me, I find that was the first experience where I became just obsessed with

03:06.720 --> 03:08.080
 history.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.640
 World War II really did it for me.

03:10.640 --> 03:17.920
 I'm not sure if it's because of the dramatization of film and TV and the way that our generation

03:17.920 --> 03:21.800
 has looked at it, but for me, it was more than that.

03:21.800 --> 03:28.440
 I felt a deep connection to it and I still can't figure out why, like a pull almost.

03:28.440 --> 03:32.520
 People joke around about those past lives and those things or those connections and

03:32.520 --> 03:38.100
 there's something deeper within me that feels a pull towards that and I'm not quite sure

03:38.100 --> 03:44.280
 if it's because I had family that escaped Hungary once the Soviets came in, so thanks

03:44.280 --> 03:51.840
 for that, or if it was because my grandfather served in it or for whatever reason, I have

03:51.840 --> 03:52.840
 this pull to it.

03:52.840 --> 03:59.840
 And so when you think about the mass casualty of the civilian population, that's very difficult

03:59.840 --> 04:05.280
 for me to wrap my brain around after being in a war and seeing when you have a small

04:05.280 --> 04:10.080
 subset of civilians die, how much of an impact that has on that community right there in

04:10.080 --> 04:12.640
 just a tiny area.

04:12.640 --> 04:17.480
 So to try to wrap my brain around what happened in Europe and all across and all of that,

04:17.480 --> 04:22.680
 I really struggle with that because I don't know that I can comprehend what that would

04:22.680 --> 04:28.000
 truly mean to somebody if I didn't experience it or see it for what it is.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
 Does that make sense?

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
 Yeah.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.940
 So first of all, you're right, a lot of people are drawn to World War II for different reasons.

04:34.940 --> 04:43.280
 The one is Hitler and Stalin trying to understand how it's possible to have that scale of evil

04:43.280 --> 04:46.160
 in very different flavors of evil.

04:46.160 --> 04:49.200
 It's almost fascinating that human nature can allow for that.

04:49.200 --> 04:54.200
 And then also it's fascinating that so many people can follow leaders like that with a

04:54.200 --> 04:57.940
 pride and with a love of country.

04:57.940 --> 05:03.800
 And that's like, it's almost like this weird experiment, it's like, wow, I wonder if I'm

05:03.800 --> 05:07.920
 made from the same cloth as those people.

05:07.920 --> 05:14.800
 Like would I be a good German if I lived in Germany and was, you know, during the time

05:14.800 --> 05:15.800
 of Hitler?

05:15.800 --> 05:21.040
 Would I believe that Germany has been done wrong, I'm Jewish by the way, which makes

05:21.040 --> 05:28.120
 me a little bit more comfortable talking about this, is would I believe in the dream sold

05:28.120 --> 05:34.240
 by a charismatic dictator who says that wrongs have been done and we need to correct those

05:34.240 --> 05:35.240
 wrongs?

05:35.240 --> 05:40.720
 That to me, this is the compelling thing that draws me to World War II, the human nature

05:40.720 --> 05:41.720
 question.

05:41.720 --> 05:42.880
 I would agree with you on that.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.360
 I think there's a way to look at people like that.

05:45.360 --> 05:50.920
 And at that time there was no real, well, there wasn't a full understanding of the psyche

05:50.920 --> 05:56.520
 the way that we're starting to, I mean, we still don't understand any of it, but it seems

05:56.520 --> 06:03.940
 like the time gap back then, there was no real understanding of sociopaths and narcissists

06:03.940 --> 06:07.280
 and psychopaths and really what those traits were.

06:07.280 --> 06:12.520
 And I feel like people will follow blindly if they're given a good enough reason.

06:12.520 --> 06:18.480
 Well, if you have an individual who is ranting and screaming at the top of his lungs in the

06:18.480 --> 06:23.580
 middle of these town squares and he's getting this attention, it's human nature to want

06:23.580 --> 06:27.520
 to understand and be a part of a group mentality.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.260
 It's human nature to want to fit in.

06:29.260 --> 06:35.080
 And so I don't know if it's more of people were at the beginning were just, this is the

06:35.080 --> 06:36.860
 cool thing to do.

06:36.860 --> 06:40.760
 Or if it was, they were genuinely terrified.

06:40.760 --> 06:44.720
 Or if there was an aspect that was like, this guy is saying something that resonates with

06:44.720 --> 06:45.720
 me.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.080
 There could be a lot of different things.

06:47.080 --> 06:54.720
 I think it's unfortunate that we didn't get to, or no one got to really examine this individual's

06:54.720 --> 06:58.680
 brain and this person and why they thought the way they thought.

06:58.680 --> 07:02.480
 Because that's always been the biggest thing for me is I'm really curious about why people

07:02.480 --> 07:07.000
 do what they do, like deeply, deeply curious about it.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.040
 I'm not sure who's more interesting, the people that follow Hitler or Hitler himself.

07:12.040 --> 07:17.440
 So I mean, the question that's coupled with that is, would history roll out in similar

07:17.440 --> 07:20.480
 ways even if there wasn't a Hitler?

07:20.480 --> 07:26.320
 It's the people that created Hitler or did Hitler create the events of World War II?

07:26.320 --> 07:29.640
 I think the people would be more interesting in my opinion.

07:29.640 --> 07:34.520
 That seems to be the, that the charismatic leaders are all out there.

07:34.520 --> 07:38.840
 The failed artists in the case of Hitler, they're all out there and it's just when there's

07:38.840 --> 07:46.080
 this environment of anger and fear, charismatic leaders can take over and it doesn't matter

07:46.080 --> 07:48.520
 if they're evil or good.

07:48.520 --> 07:55.480
 It's like a roll of the dice in terms of history, how evil, how truly insane they are.

07:55.480 --> 08:00.140
 I think Stalin was much more cold in calculating.

08:00.140 --> 08:02.000
 He wasn't as insane as Hitler.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.480
 Hitler was legitimately insane, like especially later on in the war where he would do irrational

08:08.480 --> 08:10.440
 actions I would say.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.640
 But that's like a weird roll of the dice.

08:13.640 --> 08:17.280
 You could have gotten a totally different leader.

08:17.280 --> 08:23.160
 Wanting to take over the entirety of Europe and then invading Russia, that's like insanity.

08:23.160 --> 08:28.640
 Yeah, just even, just the first part of that wanting to take over Europe, if you really

08:28.640 --> 08:34.720
 think about the scale, if you really sit down and go, this one individual was like, I want

08:34.720 --> 08:35.720
 all of this.

08:35.720 --> 08:39.920
 If you really sat down and you were to sit down and put him in his traits that we know

08:39.920 --> 08:47.880
 of into any sort of document nowadays that deems somebody a psychopath or a narcissist,

08:47.880 --> 08:50.920
 this guy would set it on fire.

08:50.920 --> 08:59.260
 He himself was so, I think so damaged and he reminds me a lot of people now who struggle

08:59.260 --> 09:00.260
 to find their way.

09:00.260 --> 09:06.220
 He reminds me a lot of angry individuals who are told no, either by women or by business

09:06.220 --> 09:10.680
 or by whatever the sector they're in.

09:10.680 --> 09:15.280
 He reminds me very much of that like, what's the word I'm looking for?

09:15.280 --> 09:20.960
 Just that individual who's just like, the world is shit and the world owes me everything.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.360
 It's that mentality.

09:22.360 --> 09:25.640
 He really came from that it seems like.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.360
 And when you foster that too long, you get that.

09:28.360 --> 09:34.760
 There's a book called, what is it, Man From Underground by Dostoevsky, I might be misnaming

09:34.760 --> 09:38.280
 the book, but it's about the bitterness of a man.

09:38.280 --> 09:42.120
 It breeds within his mind and it just grows, that bitterness.

09:42.120 --> 09:48.680
 I mean, we all have that sort of resenting of the world when you're younger, when you

09:48.680 --> 09:50.040
 have a choice.

09:50.040 --> 09:56.960
 When you fail, do you blame the world or do you hold, it's the Jaco thing, do you carry

09:56.960 --> 10:02.480
 the responsibility of that and become a better man or woman because of that?

10:02.480 --> 10:03.480
 That's the decision.

10:03.480 --> 10:09.840
 And in some sense, I mean, unfortunately, see that's because he took responsibility

10:09.840 --> 10:10.840
 and leadership.

10:10.840 --> 10:15.120
 I know you can't say he wasn't a leader.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.400
 So it's not that he's a failure.

10:17.400 --> 10:23.040
 He's not a failure, but you can't say he's powerless, did not take action.

10:23.040 --> 10:29.640
 I think he's just basically a embodiment of the anger and the fear of people at the time.

10:29.640 --> 10:35.080
 But the insanity of, obviously, many of my relatives, not just murdering them, but putting

10:35.080 --> 10:40.560
 them in camps and torturing them, but many of those people, Jewish people, were also

10:40.560 --> 10:42.040
 some of the best scientists.

10:42.040 --> 10:49.640
 The insanity of murdering some of the best Germans, it makes no sense.

10:49.640 --> 10:55.800
 So that's why it's fascinating to kind of look back at that time in history and think,

10:55.800 --> 10:57.800
 are these the same humans?

10:57.800 --> 11:02.040
 And also, are there echoes of that now?

11:02.040 --> 11:04.080
 And is that going to happen again?

11:04.080 --> 11:08.880
 Is there going to be a World War III in some other kind of way?

11:08.880 --> 11:13.880
 Is there going to be some mass scale injustice in some other kind of way, which we're not

11:13.880 --> 11:21.000
 yet, because of our blindness and maybe not learning the lessons of history, will allow

11:21.000 --> 11:23.360
 it to happen again?

11:23.360 --> 11:28.040
 And then obviously, it's a very common thing to whatever political leader you don't like,

11:28.040 --> 11:29.040
 to call them Hitler.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.040
 Of course.

11:30.040 --> 11:36.320
 Which is, that to me, I got to tell you, when somebody calls somebody Hitler, the weight

11:36.320 --> 11:40.320
 behind that has been completely lost in this generation.

11:40.320 --> 11:47.600
 This generation does not understand what that truly means to call someone Hitler or a Nazi.

11:47.600 --> 11:48.600
 Or Stalin.

11:48.600 --> 11:54.800
 To be honest, the starvation, I've just been talking to a lot of folks recently, especially

11:54.800 --> 11:58.120
 like North Korea, with Wyoming Park, starvation.

11:58.120 --> 12:06.000
 And I remember from my grandmother, it wasn't, time and time again, not having food to eat

12:06.000 --> 12:10.120
 is the thing that people say is the worst, everything.

12:10.120 --> 12:16.280
 It's way worse than murder, not having food, and the places that takes your mind and the

12:16.280 --> 12:19.840
 actions that forces you to do, that's terrifying.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.520
 And all of that seems very distant in our history.

12:22.520 --> 12:23.920
 Yeah, I love her.

12:23.920 --> 12:26.040
 I watched that interview with her.

12:26.040 --> 12:29.820
 She is, I want to talk to that woman so bad, because when she was on Joe and she sat there

12:29.820 --> 12:33.300
 and said, Joe's like, do you, have you done any therapy?

12:33.300 --> 12:34.300
 And she laughed.

12:34.300 --> 12:36.440
 I was like, oh, that's my girl.

12:36.440 --> 12:39.820
 It's such a fascinating, I mean, I would love for you to kind of talk to her and explore

12:39.820 --> 12:46.080
 her mind, because we kind of explored her story and that's, there's power and importance

12:46.080 --> 12:56.320
 to her story, but it's so difficult to understand, like, how does she become healthier and better?

12:56.320 --> 13:01.480
 Even more so than she's already, she's, she's recovered quite a bit, you know, she's found

13:01.480 --> 13:05.600
 herself quite a bit, but I wonder, is she haunted?

13:05.600 --> 13:07.040
 You're saying questions I want to ask.

13:07.040 --> 13:13.320
 Like, that's what I mean, because after being in a war, there are certain things, there

13:13.320 --> 13:18.460
 are certain atrocities that you see that, it doesn't matter the therapy that you do.

13:18.460 --> 13:21.400
 And I don't care what all the special ops guys say, like, I know plenty of them that

13:21.400 --> 13:24.600
 have a light switch and they turn it off and they can function, but I also know them when

13:24.600 --> 13:26.660
 they've been out for 10 years.

13:26.660 --> 13:31.740
 There's things that haunt people differently, but there's no way, there's not something

13:31.740 --> 13:33.680
 going on there deeply.

13:33.680 --> 13:43.320
 Yeah, but there's also extra levels of complexity in her case because, I mean, this is what,

13:43.320 --> 13:52.520
 just looking at history about family, is she spent much of her early life loving the dictator,

13:52.520 --> 13:53.520
 right?

13:53.520 --> 13:54.520
 Yeah.

13:54.520 --> 13:55.520
 We like the water or something.

13:55.520 --> 13:56.520
 Yeah.

13:56.520 --> 13:59.760
 We like water or we like this because there is no, like, individual, like, when they said

13:59.760 --> 14:01.960
 there was no love or anything.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.760
 But there is a love for the...

14:03.760 --> 14:04.760
 Just that individual.

14:04.760 --> 14:05.760
 For that individual.

14:05.760 --> 14:09.720
 And so, I mean, it's like the ultimate abusive relationship.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.120
 Oh, yeah.

14:12.120 --> 14:15.320
 But it's still love, like you don't know the alternative.

14:15.320 --> 14:22.720
 So it's not even, it's complicated because, like, I wonder if she truly explored it what

14:22.720 --> 14:28.760
 you would find because the trauma, much of her trauma, I think comes from when she was

14:28.760 --> 14:34.040
 escaping North Korea, treatment by China.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.040
 It's like the...

14:35.040 --> 14:39.880
 And her mom and what she had to witness within that and being helpless with that on her own.

14:39.880 --> 14:45.800
 So it's like evil men essentially abusing her, trading her, you know, and doing so nonchalantly,

14:45.800 --> 14:52.000
 like it's part of just the way of life that I wonder if she sees kind of, yeah, it's so

14:52.000 --> 14:54.480
 complicated because childhood...

14:54.480 --> 14:57.200
 It would be normal to her because she didn't know any different.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.200
 Exactly.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.200
 Like there's...

14:59.200 --> 15:04.200
 Like I grew up poor, but I never sensed that.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.880
 Because your parents didn't make you.

15:05.880 --> 15:08.040
 Well, and everyone else around was too.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.040
 Right.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.040
 And so you don't notice it.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.680
 I mean, it's a cultural thing.

15:11.680 --> 15:16.480
 So the way you grow up, you only start to notice it when you compare yourself to others,

15:16.480 --> 15:18.320
 when you learn of the alternative.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.560
 That's the dark reality when you're abused.

15:20.560 --> 15:30.120
 You truly begin to suffer in some kind of way when you understand that you were being

15:30.120 --> 15:32.520
 abused.

15:32.520 --> 15:38.720
 That's a dark kind of thought that I wonder if you live your whole life just in that abuse,

15:38.720 --> 15:41.600
 if you don't know better, that that's a safer...

15:41.600 --> 15:48.000
 That's like, what's a better life, suffering and then learning that you were suffering

15:48.000 --> 15:51.040
 or just suffering until your last days.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.840
 There's two ways to look at this.

15:52.840 --> 15:58.640
 I'd argue on one side that suffering and suffering until you die, you know no different.

15:58.640 --> 16:00.040
 So you can't have hope.

16:00.040 --> 16:03.520
 You can't have this idea that there's better.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.920
 And sometimes that's...

16:05.920 --> 16:06.920
 Keep that in its box.

16:06.920 --> 16:11.920
 But then if you have kind of what you have with Park where she knows now that there's

16:11.920 --> 16:15.560
 different, she knows that there's better, then you run into those.

16:15.560 --> 16:17.340
 What is the damage that has been done?

16:17.340 --> 16:19.600
 What is going to be passed on as intergenerational trauma?

16:19.600 --> 16:21.000
 I know she's a mom.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.120
 So it's like, now you got to look long term a little bit because now she's an influence

16:25.120 --> 16:26.200
 on a child.

16:26.200 --> 16:32.640
 And there's a positive to looking at both, I would say.

16:32.640 --> 16:36.540
 And I know that sounds horrible for the living in trauma your whole life and just not knowing

16:36.540 --> 16:37.960
 any better.

16:37.960 --> 16:38.960
 But there's...

16:38.960 --> 16:47.260
 I don't know if that saves the brain and the body and just that overall or if it actually

16:47.260 --> 16:50.000
 would be better because there's no way to really find that out.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
 I don't think.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
 Yeah, I think.

16:52.000 --> 16:57.160
 But the reality is when you give people hope and you make them realize that they're suffering,

16:57.160 --> 16:58.680
 you're putting a burden on them.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.880
 That's the first step on a long journey.

17:00.880 --> 17:05.440
 And so, and obviously now that she knows that the suffering she wants to make people in

17:05.440 --> 17:08.720
 North Korea currently suffer less.

17:08.720 --> 17:10.680
 And that's an admirable goal.

17:10.680 --> 17:16.560
 It's what we do to each other is try to like, when you see suffering in the world, you try

17:16.560 --> 17:23.920
 to make it better and unmask that's probably in a long arc of history going to make for

17:23.920 --> 17:25.080
 a better world.

17:25.080 --> 17:28.460
 I'm hopeful at that idea for North Korea.

17:28.460 --> 17:35.320
 I'm hopeful for that because you never want to leave individuals suffering when you know

17:35.320 --> 17:38.280
 that they're actively suffering while you're just living your day to day life in the Western

17:38.280 --> 17:42.120
 world just out grocery shopping and you see all this food and you know in the back of

17:42.120 --> 17:43.120
 your mind...

17:43.120 --> 17:45.120
 Like that interview fucked me up a little bit, I won't lie.

17:45.120 --> 17:48.880
 And I had some of the girls in my office listen to it, they're just bawling.

17:48.880 --> 17:56.640
 Because we're all parents and there's this idea that not being able to feed our children,

17:56.640 --> 17:59.100
 just the idea of that damages the psyche.

17:59.100 --> 18:03.240
 It brings up the pain in the chest, just the idea of it.

18:03.240 --> 18:07.120
 And so going to the grocery store for about a week after that, I just remember standing

18:07.120 --> 18:11.060
 there looking and just going, fuck are we doing?

18:11.060 --> 18:17.200
 But then there's that snap reality that comes into play and goes, so how do we fix that?

18:17.200 --> 18:21.960
 You got to take on China, that's never going to happen.

18:21.960 --> 18:24.520
 And the reason that's not going to happen, it's happening again.

18:24.520 --> 18:29.280
 So Akhani comes down through Afghanistan, Chinese are all through Afghanistan, Iran

18:29.280 --> 18:34.560
 makes the deal with China for the roadway to get the oil, well that's done in the blink

18:34.560 --> 18:36.560
 of an eye without anyone knowing.

18:36.560 --> 18:37.960
 There's no way.

18:37.960 --> 18:44.000
 There's just so much at play with China, they control such a large aspect of our world,

18:44.000 --> 18:50.840
 unfortunately that to take and free North Korea, a drastic action would have to happen.

18:50.840 --> 18:54.240
 And then your people would come in, it would be a mess.

18:54.240 --> 18:55.520
 What do you mean your people?

18:55.520 --> 18:57.000
 What do you mean your people?

18:57.000 --> 18:58.760
 Your Russians.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.600
 Did you hear what she said about Russians?

19:00.600 --> 19:01.600
 Did you hear what she says?

19:01.600 --> 19:02.600
 Russians?

19:02.600 --> 19:03.600
 I love Russians.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.600
 You know what I didn't love?

19:04.600 --> 19:07.760
 The Russian recruiting video that came out, that shit was terrifying.

19:07.760 --> 19:08.760
 Did you watch it?

19:08.760 --> 19:09.760
 No.

19:09.760 --> 19:10.760
 I told you about it and of course you didn't watch it.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.920
 I didn't watch it, I'm sorry.

19:12.920 --> 19:20.120
 The USA put out a recruiting video and then like a day or two later Russia put one out.

19:20.120 --> 19:27.260
 And the recruiting video in the States was an animation of a female soldier with two

19:27.260 --> 19:31.920
 moms and she was going to go change the world, right?

19:31.920 --> 19:35.160
 Russia came out with one.

19:35.160 --> 19:40.600
 It's like, it's the character from like Rocky essentially and they're guys in the mud and

19:40.600 --> 19:43.800
 just in the rain just fucking doing pushups, just pushing it out.

19:43.800 --> 19:47.600
 They're just like, they see their boot, they're just like crushing things and I'm like, and

19:47.600 --> 19:51.800
 it's all like, and the deep Russian voice, I'm like, oh my God.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.360
 Which one is better would you say?

19:53.360 --> 19:54.360
 Which bothered you more?

19:54.360 --> 19:58.960
 What do you mean by bother, specify.

19:58.960 --> 20:02.640
 So deception is a funny thing because when you're young and you're choosing to go to

20:02.640 --> 20:07.640
 the military or not, it's not like you know, like none of us know what the best trajectory

20:07.640 --> 20:08.960
 for a life is.

20:08.960 --> 20:13.520
 For many people going to the military is a really, makes them incredible human beings.

20:13.520 --> 20:16.360
 Some of the best people in this world I know are soldiers.

20:16.360 --> 20:20.320
 So it's, I'm not, I don't mean like it's somehow bad to go to the military.

20:20.320 --> 20:25.800
 I think it's a great choice, but there is something, the honest truth is I just don't

20:25.800 --> 20:28.560
 like marketing people.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.560
 And so this is essentially a marketing effort.

20:30.560 --> 20:31.920
 Yeah, it is a marketing effort.

20:31.920 --> 20:34.880
 So which one do you like as a marketing effort better?

20:34.880 --> 20:35.880
 Russia.

20:35.880 --> 20:36.880
 Oh, yeah, I do.

20:36.880 --> 20:37.880
 There you go.

20:37.880 --> 20:38.880
 I do.

20:38.880 --> 20:41.520
 Cause Canada doesn't, you know what our recruiting videos are?

20:41.520 --> 20:44.200
 It's like, I love it.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.200
 They're the best.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.200
 Sorry, eh?

20:46.200 --> 20:47.200
 Yeah.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.200
 Oh, fuck.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.200
 Here we go.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.200
 It's starting.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.200
 It started.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.200
 Awesome.

20:52.200 --> 20:55.760
 So Canada does these ones where it's like, it'll have a bunch of like soldiers doing

20:55.760 --> 20:58.240
 movements and then they'll like snip it together really quick.

20:58.240 --> 21:02.840
 It'll be like a Navy one and a guy jumping out of a plane and then it'll be like an artillery

21:02.840 --> 21:07.600
 and then like an armored and it'd be like, join the Canadian forces today.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.300
 And like, that's like their, their videos.

21:10.300 --> 21:16.000
 So it's like very marketable, very palatable to Canadians who don't really want war and

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
 who don't really acknowledge their military in the first place and do everything they

21:20.000 --> 21:24.160
 can to make sure that vets don't get any support when they come home.

21:24.160 --> 21:27.640
 So they, I can see why that one is acceptable.

21:27.640 --> 21:33.000
 What Russia did was meant to be more of an intimidation tactic in my opinion.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.080
 I like that style better though.

21:35.080 --> 21:38.600
 I think we need harder, I think we need people to be harder.

21:38.600 --> 21:43.520
 I think it's acceptable and okay to say that our soldiers need to have a harder mindset,

21:43.520 --> 21:48.120
 a stronger mindset, a better mentality and mental health support going into the service

21:48.120 --> 21:54.200
 and a harder body because I know when you go to the US, I've also encountered plenty

21:54.200 --> 21:57.000
 of soldiers that are 600 pounds.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.340
 What are you going to do?

21:59.340 --> 22:03.200
 So we should say that you, when you joined the military, you were in incredible shape

22:03.200 --> 22:05.760
 or not maybe incredible, but very good shape.

22:05.760 --> 22:06.760
 No, I was in incredible shape.

22:06.760 --> 22:07.760
 It was the best shape of my life.

22:07.760 --> 22:08.760
 Yeah.

22:08.760 --> 22:09.760
 Yeah.

22:09.760 --> 22:10.760
 So.

22:10.760 --> 22:11.760
 I'm okay with that.

22:11.760 --> 22:12.760
 It's okay.

22:12.760 --> 22:13.760
 I, you know what?

22:13.760 --> 22:14.760
 I used to do sit ups.

22:14.760 --> 22:18.080
 Like no, I would do sit ups in the morning when I was little until I could see my six.

22:18.080 --> 22:21.520
 Like I always had a six pack because all I did was train.

22:21.520 --> 22:26.120
 But like if I couldn't like see it, I would just sit there in morning cartoons and just

22:26.120 --> 22:27.120
 do sit ups.

22:27.120 --> 22:30.180
 And my mom and dad thought that was like normal acceptable behavior.

22:30.180 --> 22:33.600
 So if you had like Instagram back then, you'd be a David Goggins, you would be just like

22:33.600 --> 22:34.600
 screaming.

22:34.600 --> 22:35.600
 Without the cursing.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.080
 That cursing started once the military started.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.080
 Okay.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.080
 Got it.

22:39.080 --> 22:43.160
 So I mean, the people should know, is it probably already know that you also competed in Taekwondo,

22:43.160 --> 22:45.280
 like you were an athlete of all kinds.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.600
 They even saw rugby in there.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.600
 Yeah.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.280
 I was, I was, I was good at rugby.

22:50.280 --> 22:55.920
 I played that for seven, six years, I guess you could say total.

22:55.920 --> 23:00.840
 I think the worst injury I ever ended up having was I tore my right eyelid off.

23:00.840 --> 23:02.660
 We were doing an exhibition game.

23:02.660 --> 23:04.160
 I don't do exhibition games well.

23:04.160 --> 23:06.120
 I don't do like for fun well.

23:06.120 --> 23:07.120
 I don't do like.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.120
 So you're very competitive.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.880
 No, not me.

23:09.880 --> 23:10.880
 So you're being funny.

23:10.880 --> 23:11.880
 Ah, there it is.

23:11.880 --> 23:12.880
 He gets it.

23:12.880 --> 23:15.480
 You see, he's not, he's not a robot.

23:15.480 --> 23:23.940
 What I was saying though to you was that we did an exhibition game and the team ahead

23:23.940 --> 23:24.940
 was winning.

23:24.940 --> 23:28.400
 The team we were playing was winning, which was annoying.

23:28.400 --> 23:33.680
 And so there was an opportunity to take out a girl that was going one end of the field

23:33.680 --> 23:36.840
 to the other and she just kept hitting tries left, right and center.

23:36.840 --> 23:37.960
 She was fast.

23:37.960 --> 23:42.740
 So I figured if I just aimed her up, like she's a target and I just run full force at

23:42.740 --> 23:47.360
 her because she was really, she was a tall individual, but I just, if I do that, I'll

23:47.360 --> 23:48.360
 take her out of the knees.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.800
 So I did that.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.940
 But that, what that resulted in was she put her tooth through her mouth guard and knocked

23:53.940 --> 23:55.480
 out and didn't just, she just stayed there.

23:55.480 --> 24:00.440
 But when I stood up, I tore the right eyelid off and it was hanging from the inner corner.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.440
 Yeah.

24:01.440 --> 24:07.800
 My mom was there cause mom was my mom's, my biggest fan and she's supportive of everything

24:07.800 --> 24:08.800
 and she didn't miss a game.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.900
 She didn't miss an anything.

24:10.900 --> 24:14.760
 And um, I stood up and I kind of turned around and we already had a girl break her nose that

24:14.760 --> 24:15.760
 day.

24:15.760 --> 24:19.020
 So she was on the sideline with her nose sideways and just bloody.

24:19.020 --> 24:22.760
 My mom was like, I'll take her to the emergency after once the game's over.

24:22.760 --> 24:26.680
 And so I turned around and looked at her and she just, she almost vomited on the spot and

24:26.680 --> 24:27.680
 I was like, what's wrong?

24:27.680 --> 24:29.960
 She's like, don't move your eyelids off.

24:29.960 --> 24:34.120
 I'm like, but I can see like I was trying to blink, but like it was just down so I could

24:34.120 --> 24:36.080
 just constantly see.

24:36.080 --> 24:37.880
 She's like, we're just, we're just going to go to the emergency.

24:37.880 --> 24:39.640
 We're just going to go there now.

24:39.640 --> 24:40.640
 Was there blood?

24:40.640 --> 24:41.640
 Yeah.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.360
 There's lots of it, but I couldn't really tell.

24:43.360 --> 24:44.360
 Okay.

24:44.360 --> 24:46.360
 Were you okay with blood at that point?

24:46.360 --> 24:47.360
 Yeah.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.360
 Yeah.

24:48.360 --> 24:49.360
 I mean, I guess you did taekwondo and all that.

24:49.360 --> 24:50.360
 Yeah.

24:50.360 --> 24:51.360
 I didn't get knocked out very often.

24:51.360 --> 24:53.720
 Like when I was younger in taekwondo, I was really good.

24:53.720 --> 24:56.400
 I only lost a handful of times.

24:56.400 --> 24:59.080
 So when I did lose, that was bad.

24:59.080 --> 25:04.400
 But I never had like a broken nose or a lot of blood on my face, like nothing like that

25:04.400 --> 25:05.400
 really.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.920
 So nothing freaked me out too much.

25:07.920 --> 25:12.360
 Was there aggression there or just purely competition over skill?

25:12.360 --> 25:14.000
 A mix of both.

25:14.000 --> 25:19.960
 I was, this was right after, not too long after my coach went to prison for statutory

25:19.960 --> 25:27.800
 rape and that was like how you talk about Park talking about how that was like she knew

25:27.800 --> 25:31.040
 love because of that person.

25:31.040 --> 25:33.460
 That person was like a God to me.

25:33.460 --> 25:36.240
 And so when that happened, I was just an angry individual from that point on.

25:36.240 --> 25:38.680
 So there was competition and aggression mixed in there.

25:38.680 --> 25:44.200
 Oh, like it was betrayal that there's just somebody that is, was a symbol of love for

25:44.200 --> 25:46.640
 you, could also be a very bad person.

25:46.640 --> 25:52.000
 I used to eat, sleep, and breathe whatever that man said from four years old on.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.440
 I lived with my coaches at a point so I could train that much.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.140
 I helped look after their daughter.

25:58.140 --> 26:00.240
 I was at the club 24 seven.

26:00.240 --> 26:05.880
 It just the idea that somebody could do something like that, yeah, that really messed me up.

26:05.880 --> 26:10.200
 Where were you on 9 11?

26:10.200 --> 26:15.700
 I was 11 and I was in my parents basement.

26:15.700 --> 26:16.700
 In where?

26:16.700 --> 26:17.700
 Ontario.

26:17.700 --> 26:18.700
 Ontario, Canada.

26:18.700 --> 26:26.720
 What did you think of 9 11 at that age from Canada that have an impact on you in terms

26:26.720 --> 26:35.680
 of changing the level of evil you thought is there in the world today?

26:35.680 --> 26:36.680
 Not initially.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.400
 I remember it really vividly.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.480
 I have a decent memory for certain things.

26:41.480 --> 26:44.800
 It seems like stuff like that I stick with really well.

26:44.800 --> 26:45.800
 I remember watching it.

26:45.800 --> 26:51.440
 I was sitting on the couch and my mom called my dad because my parents are truck drivers.

26:51.440 --> 26:56.160
 My dad was on the road, if I'm not mistaken, and he would go in and out of cities all the

26:56.160 --> 26:57.160
 time.

26:57.160 --> 26:58.160
 I think he was on the East Coast.

26:58.160 --> 27:00.040
 My mom was a little panicky.

27:00.040 --> 27:01.480
 She tried to get a hold of him.

27:01.480 --> 27:07.600
 I think at the time it was beepers and yeah, so he would get a beep, he would go to a payphone

27:07.600 --> 27:08.600
 and call us.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.120
 He was fine.

27:10.120 --> 27:16.400
 I remember my mom being really upset and I couldn't quite grasp why she was so upset.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.640
 I knew something really bad had happened.

27:18.640 --> 27:24.360
 It's when I then saw the second plane go into the tower and I remember her just like the

27:24.360 --> 27:29.480
 stereotypical like hand over her mouth and she just felt sick and she just was so confused

27:29.480 --> 27:33.640
 and I knew it was bad, but I didn't fully grasp it.

27:33.640 --> 27:36.720
 We went to school that day and they had talked about it briefly.

27:36.720 --> 27:39.380
 You could hear the teachers kind of reminiscing about it.

27:39.380 --> 27:47.560
 There was a point that week that all of a sudden all of the children who were from a

27:47.560 --> 27:50.720
 Middle Eastern family were not at school.

27:50.720 --> 27:55.440
 I just remember them saying like a lot of people aren't coming to school, but it was

27:55.440 --> 27:56.440
 in particular.

27:56.440 --> 28:02.360
 I think parents were afraid once it got out that it was of a certain group.

28:02.360 --> 28:06.400
 They were afraid for their own kids and fair enough, I mean, you never know.

28:06.400 --> 28:11.280
 You don't know and I knew it impacted me enough that I did write.

28:11.280 --> 28:16.280
 I remember the school was doing a memorial for it and I remember they asked, I wrote

28:16.280 --> 28:21.400
 a poem and a reporter was there and I read it on air.

28:21.400 --> 28:28.400
 I remember it was a very short one, but I remember I wanted to do something, but I didn't

28:28.400 --> 28:30.720
 know why or for what reason.

28:30.720 --> 28:34.720
 I knew I wanted to do something to honor it, but I couldn't grasp why.

28:34.720 --> 28:38.280
 You eventually went to Afghanistan.

28:38.280 --> 28:43.920
 Did that begin to plant the seed of thinking about conflict in the world?

28:43.920 --> 28:45.200
 It's a good question.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.120
 I never thought about it that in depth.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.680
 I mean, I've done 12 years of therapy.

28:48.680 --> 28:52.360
 You think that would have come up, Dr. Passi, but apparently not.

28:52.360 --> 28:53.360
 We'll work on it though.

28:53.360 --> 28:58.920
 I mean, when did the idea of war start entering your mind?

28:58.920 --> 29:02.440
 Late high school, I think it was for me.

29:02.440 --> 29:04.380
 I finished high school at 17.

29:04.380 --> 29:08.840
 I moved away and went to college, I went to Algonquin College because I wasn't smart enough

29:08.840 --> 29:13.800
 to get into Ottawa U. I was like, well, Algonquin, cheers.

29:13.800 --> 29:17.840
 I just wanted to play sports and frankly, I wanted away from my small town that I was

29:17.840 --> 29:18.840
 living in.

29:18.840 --> 29:22.320
 I went through a bad high school breakup as a kid and you know that where you think that's

29:22.320 --> 29:27.320
 like the love of your life and you just can't bear to be anywhere near anybody.

29:27.320 --> 29:31.520
 I moved away as fast as I possibly could.

29:31.520 --> 29:36.640
 I didn't grasp it still at that point.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.840
 Love and heartbreak.

29:38.840 --> 29:40.480
 Okay.

29:40.480 --> 29:42.640
 Why did you become a soldier?

29:42.640 --> 29:45.280
 Why did you want to become a soldier?

29:45.280 --> 29:48.760
 My parents told me from an early age, they always figured I would either be a cop.

29:48.760 --> 29:54.160
 I would do, they didn't think military, but they thought it would be like a type A personality,

29:54.160 --> 29:59.400
 possibly carry a gun situation and I'd never hunted before.

29:59.400 --> 30:00.520
 We never had guns in our house.

30:00.520 --> 30:03.920
 I was never exposed to weapons of any kind.

30:03.920 --> 30:07.000
 If anything, it was the opposite.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.680
 All the hunters on the property, like all the deer would come to our property and all

30:10.680 --> 30:14.080
 the hunters would be, no, I'm not, my mom would put salt licks out so that they wouldn't

30:14.080 --> 30:15.080
 get killed.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.640
 Your property was the safe space for the deer.

30:16.640 --> 30:17.640
 Yeah.

30:17.640 --> 30:22.160
 It was 17 acres of forest and they just, we had two turkeys that used to walk up and down

30:22.160 --> 30:23.440
 the driveway every day.

30:23.440 --> 30:26.280
 We had bears in there and nobody bothered them.

30:26.280 --> 30:31.000
 And so there was no aspect of like, I want to go kill shit, that was not like a thing.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.800
 I had no idea I wanted to take anybody off the face of the earth or any thing.

30:35.800 --> 30:43.400
 I went to school and because I'm a history person, my parents has always made it really

30:43.400 --> 30:46.360
 important that Remembrance Day is the thing in our life.

30:46.360 --> 30:47.480
 So that's Veterans Day for you.

30:47.480 --> 30:51.720
 So it's November 11th and it's, you go, you honor.

30:51.720 --> 30:55.920
 I don't care if you don't want to go, I don't care if it's raining, you go.

30:55.920 --> 31:01.480
 And so I went to the Remembrance Day ceremony in Ottawa that year, which was, it's our capital,

31:01.480 --> 31:04.800
 which is, yeah, it's our capital and it's really small.

31:04.800 --> 31:10.360
 And so I went, but I took the bus and I was on the bus back to Algonquin.

31:10.360 --> 31:16.800
 And I met a lady who was like a World War II vet, really old lady, she had an Air Force

31:16.800 --> 31:19.120
 uniform on and just like this row of medals.

31:19.120 --> 31:25.560
 And I mean, I think you can tell by our limited to extreme interactions we've had over the

31:25.560 --> 31:29.160
 short period of time, I'm curious and I'll just ask you.

31:29.160 --> 31:32.480
 And so I just got up and talked to her and just started talking to her.

31:32.480 --> 31:37.600
 And she didn't say like, I don't remember exactly her words, but she served, she was

31:37.600 --> 31:44.320
 one of the first females to fly and all of these kinds of things that stuck in my head.

31:44.320 --> 31:47.360
 And we just kind of kept talking and I missed my stop.

31:47.360 --> 31:51.960
 And then I finished talking to her and I got back on the bus and went back to the college

31:51.960 --> 31:58.400
 and walked into my small apartment where I had two roommates, these two guys I went to

31:58.400 --> 32:01.080
 high school with, one of them I went to high school with, one was from out of town.

32:01.080 --> 32:08.280
 And I just didn't like what I was, I wasn't happy, I wasn't doing what I wanted to do.

32:08.280 --> 32:11.360
 And I didn't know what I wanted to do truthfully.

32:11.360 --> 32:14.600
 Something just said, why don't you join the army?

32:14.600 --> 32:19.080
 Like in myself, my self talk was like, let's just join the military, let's do it.

32:19.080 --> 32:24.640
 Are you in general somebody that just follows the gut, like when your heart tells you something,

32:24.640 --> 32:25.640
 you go with it?

32:25.640 --> 32:31.120
 For the most part, because I figured out, at least now I figured out what parts I could,

32:31.120 --> 32:33.280
 like what feeling I can trust and which one I can't.

32:33.280 --> 32:37.160
 Which one's anxiety versus which one's my actual intuition talking.

32:37.160 --> 32:39.720
 So why did you sign up to be an artillery gunner?

32:39.720 --> 32:42.240
 Because they wouldn't let me be infantry.

32:42.240 --> 32:48.640
 I mean, why would you want to be infantry?

32:48.640 --> 32:52.440
 I mean, you're naming a lot of dangerous activities.

32:52.440 --> 32:56.480
 Yeah, but that wasn't a thought in my mind at the time.

32:56.480 --> 32:59.760
 My idea was if I was going to do this and I was going to put myself through the bullshit

32:59.760 --> 33:04.480
 and the training and all of the hell and the pushups and the screaming dad, I wanted to

33:04.480 --> 33:07.060
 do something that I know was actually going to be affecting something.

33:07.060 --> 33:11.320
 And what I knew was making change or affecting or on the front lines was infantry, artillery

33:11.320 --> 33:12.320
 or armored.

33:12.320 --> 33:14.040
 So I was like, one of those.

33:14.040 --> 33:16.920
 Can you explain the difference, infantry, artillery and armored?

33:16.920 --> 33:20.800
 Do you want like the layman's term or do you want me to actually explain, explain?

33:20.800 --> 33:24.440
 Well, listening to your conversation with Jaco, especially, I love how you get into

33:24.440 --> 33:25.440
 details.

33:25.440 --> 33:26.440
 Okay, so let's detail this then.

33:26.440 --> 33:27.440
 Okay.

33:27.440 --> 33:34.240
 So infantry is your frontline door kicking, you know, blasting the door open, running

33:34.240 --> 33:36.640
 and get the fuck on the ground, just that, that, that, that, that.

33:36.640 --> 33:39.840
 They're the guys that, you know, double tap you in the face and they show up in the middle

33:39.840 --> 33:41.800
 of the night and put a barrel in your head.

33:41.800 --> 33:46.480
 Like those are the guys that are sleeping in the trenches, that are eating MREs, who

33:46.480 --> 33:51.360
 are being shot at, who are being blown up, who are doing the dirty work and not sleeping

33:51.360 --> 33:55.840
 and carrying the a hundred pound pack and, and are side by side with your buddies in

33:55.840 --> 33:56.840
 the trenches.

33:56.840 --> 33:57.840
 I wanted that.

33:57.840 --> 33:58.840
 That.

33:58.840 --> 34:01.520
 They said it was too small for that.

34:01.520 --> 34:02.520
 So then...

34:02.520 --> 34:05.720
 You were, sorry to interrupt, you were too small under a hundred pounds?

34:05.720 --> 34:10.800
 At the time I was about 103 and I'm, I'm five foot, like on a, if you roll my back out,

34:10.800 --> 34:14.640
 like I really try, I'm five foot.

34:14.640 --> 34:19.880
 At the time though, I think my, my license said 411, so.

34:19.880 --> 34:23.040
 So you were too small for infantry.

34:23.040 --> 34:24.040
 Yeah.

34:24.040 --> 34:28.400
 They just, like, there was no mandate at which they said you can't be, but they said, you

34:28.400 --> 34:31.120
 know, we don't want to put you through training that you're going to fail out of and then

34:31.120 --> 34:33.560
 have to recourse you and then find a new job for you.

34:33.560 --> 34:36.800
 And they want to try to, this is what you're going in for.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.560
 They want to have you follow through that path.

34:39.560 --> 34:42.840
 So then there was armored, which are your tanks.

34:42.840 --> 34:48.120
 So that's your movie like Fury where your tank battles and, which we don't really do

34:48.120 --> 34:51.920
 anymore, but you're rolling around in tanks, you've got guys in the back or you're a driver,

34:51.920 --> 34:57.280
 you're a turret gunner, which I would have enjoyed, but the idea of being in a closed

34:57.280 --> 35:00.420
 metal box, something about it made me panic.

35:00.420 --> 35:03.000
 So I was like, maybe not for me.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.680
 There's of course power to that kind of a big gun.

35:06.680 --> 35:08.760
 Well, that's why I went for the bigger one.

35:08.760 --> 35:09.760
 Okay.

35:09.760 --> 35:12.720
 By the way, think of Russia leads the world in number of tanks.

35:12.720 --> 35:19.480
 We're still, it's very like, what is it, alpha demonstration of like, look, we have largest

35:19.480 --> 35:20.660
 number of tanks.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.120
 You know what takes tanks out though?

35:22.120 --> 35:23.120
 What?

35:23.120 --> 35:25.280
 Some gasoline, some old batteries and a wire.

35:25.280 --> 35:27.520
 Yeah, but tanks still look badass.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.380
 They look great, but they don't last.

35:29.380 --> 35:33.300
 But so much of the military, like we said with the recruiting videos, it's a display

35:33.300 --> 35:37.080
 of power versus the actual implementation of power.

35:37.080 --> 35:38.080
 Fair.

35:38.080 --> 35:39.080
 Okay.

35:39.080 --> 35:40.080
 Artillery.

35:40.080 --> 35:41.080
 So I'm doing my best here.

35:41.080 --> 35:45.360
 I don't know what double tap means, which you said earlier, it means two shots to the

35:45.360 --> 35:46.360
 face.

35:46.360 --> 35:47.360
 Why two?

35:47.360 --> 35:48.360
 To be sure.

35:48.360 --> 35:49.360
 Okay.

35:49.360 --> 35:50.360
 All right.

35:50.360 --> 35:51.360
 You guys, taxpayers pay for the ammo.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.360
 It's fine.

35:52.360 --> 35:54.000
 So, but you don't want to do three because that's wasting the ammo.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.560
 Well, that's now that's a waste.

35:55.560 --> 35:56.560
 Okay.

35:56.560 --> 35:57.560
 Double tap to the face.

35:57.560 --> 36:01.320
 There's so much awesome terminology here or gruesome terminology, depending on your

36:01.320 --> 36:02.320
 perspective.

36:02.320 --> 36:03.320
 Okay.

36:03.320 --> 36:04.320
 So artillery.

36:04.320 --> 36:05.320
 Yeah.

36:05.320 --> 36:06.320
 So that's the hand of God.

36:06.320 --> 36:07.320
 Sorry.

36:07.320 --> 36:16.240
 No, that's intensely a romanticized version, but okay, artillery, the hand of God.

36:16.240 --> 36:19.720
 So it will reach out and touch you from wherever we want.

36:19.720 --> 36:24.800
 It's like F18 pilots or bombers.

36:24.800 --> 36:28.160
 You won't know they're there until they're there.

36:28.160 --> 36:33.720
 And so for artillery, I really honestly didn't think artillery would be a fit for me.

36:33.720 --> 36:35.160
 I didn't know much about it.

36:35.160 --> 36:38.280
 They were just like, these are what you can pick from.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.280
 And I was like, I'll go here.

36:40.280 --> 36:43.780
 So in World War II, they used much closer artillery.

36:43.780 --> 36:50.180
 So we're called the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery because the Queen made us Royal Canadian Artillery.

36:50.180 --> 36:52.400
 And we shoot these rounds.

36:52.400 --> 36:55.080
 When you're in training, you shoot smaller, smaller ammunition.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.520
 They're about 40 pounds.

36:56.520 --> 37:00.720
 They go, I'm going to get this wrong, 20 K, 20 kilometers.

37:00.720 --> 37:04.240
 So whatever that is in your mile things.

37:04.240 --> 37:08.840
 And they have a casing on them and they're much easier.

37:08.840 --> 37:10.340
 They're easier to handle.

37:10.340 --> 37:11.340
 The guns are smaller.

37:11.340 --> 37:12.640
 You need less people for them.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.360
 They're basically what you train on nowadays.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.180
 It's not what we use overseas.

37:16.180 --> 37:19.480
 What we use overseas, now those things are beautiful.

37:19.480 --> 37:25.640
 Those are just a sheer work of the engineering behind them just makes my heart skip a beat.

37:25.640 --> 37:27.360
 Yeah, the engineering on modern guns is amazing.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.000
 So are we talking about machine guns here?

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
 So fully automatic?

37:30.000 --> 37:31.720
 No, you're talking about an artillery gun.

37:31.720 --> 37:38.600
 So what it is, it's a 155 millimeter howitzer that shoots up to up to 40 kilometers accurately,

37:38.600 --> 37:44.120
 45 unrecorded and it shoots a hundred pound round.

37:44.120 --> 37:47.760
 Oh, okay.

37:47.760 --> 37:50.560
 So that, but there is still precision.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.560
 Accurate as hell.

37:51.560 --> 37:52.560
 Accurate.

37:52.560 --> 37:53.560
 Okay.

37:53.560 --> 37:56.960
 Accurate if the people behind it that are shooting it and aiming it are accurate.

37:56.960 --> 37:58.400
 Okay.

37:58.400 --> 38:01.920
 So how, at which stage of the warfare do they come in?

38:01.920 --> 38:03.240
 Are they saving you?

38:03.240 --> 38:08.680
 Like say a bunch of people get raided, a bunch of the sole infantry get raided and then the

38:08.680 --> 38:13.240
 artillery saves them or are they the first line of attack or what are they, where does

38:13.240 --> 38:14.720
 the artillery go?

38:14.720 --> 38:17.400
 Like the hand of God presumes they're helping.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.400
 Yeah.

38:18.400 --> 38:19.400
 Yeah.

38:19.400 --> 38:20.400
 That's, well, that's it.

38:20.400 --> 38:25.000
 So depending on the operation or whomever is running it or how they want it done, sometimes

38:25.000 --> 38:29.200
 if they just know there's targets, they'll use us, you know, high value targets.

38:29.200 --> 38:32.720
 So we have this round, it's called the Excalibur round.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.680
 It costs about half a million dollars per round.

38:34.680 --> 38:39.840
 It comes in a special tube that is like sealed and locked and you have to get permission

38:39.840 --> 38:43.440
 from Ottawa to shoot it and it's only used for VIP targets.

38:43.440 --> 38:50.280
 So like we have VIP for everyone and it will, it's GPS guided, it's rocket propelled and

38:50.280 --> 38:57.040
 when you fire it, it will, if this is a wall and somebody's standing on this side of it,

38:57.040 --> 38:58.120
 we'll hit you right there.

38:58.120 --> 39:01.480
 We won't touch that wall, it will hit you pinpoint.

39:01.480 --> 39:06.480
 It'll go right through whatever concrete, whatever and it will destroy.

39:06.480 --> 39:12.520
 So it's basically the same thing as being a sniper, but with a much more damaging weapon.

39:12.520 --> 39:13.880
 We don't use that round often.

39:13.880 --> 39:18.160
 I think it's only been used a handful of times max in Afghanistan that I'm aware of.

39:18.160 --> 39:24.120
 Again, I haven't, I wasn't there from 2009 until 21, but I, I know people that still

39:24.120 --> 39:28.200
 deployed in that, in those units and I don't know that it was used very often, but the

39:28.200 --> 39:33.360
 regular rounds, so there's HE, there's loom, so HE is high explosive, there's loom.

39:33.360 --> 39:39.120
 You shoot that, it explodes in the sky, it lights up the sky for the infantry below and

39:39.120 --> 39:42.580
 then there's shrapnel rounds that will explode in the sky and then shrapnel just rains down

39:42.580 --> 39:43.580
 hell on you.

39:43.580 --> 39:51.040
 HE is what you use normally in my, I'm trying to say this right because I know people squawked

39:51.040 --> 39:53.760
 at me about some of the stuff on Jocko, so I'm trying to be very accurate.

39:53.760 --> 39:58.280
 In my experience, we used HE rounds to wipe people off the face of the earth when the

39:58.280 --> 40:00.080
 infantry needed us.

40:00.080 --> 40:05.760
 So we would get a call at any time and there's always two guns together.

40:05.760 --> 40:08.440
 So you never, you never go solo gun ever.

40:08.440 --> 40:12.600
 If you are, it's, there's, it's sketchy and there's bad shits happening.

40:12.600 --> 40:13.600
 Can you explain that?

40:13.600 --> 40:15.240
 So there's two gun, two people, two guns?

40:15.240 --> 40:17.480
 No, two guns with each gun troop.

40:17.480 --> 40:20.400
 So each gun troop has five to seven people running a gun at all times.

40:20.400 --> 40:21.400
 Oh wow.

40:21.400 --> 40:22.400
 It takes a lot of people to run one of those.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.240
 How much electronics is there?

40:24.240 --> 40:28.360
 The GPS, like the computer system that's on it itself, I never ran that much, but it is

40:28.360 --> 40:32.620
 completely technologically, it's GPS guided.

40:32.620 --> 40:35.400
 All you have to do is literally type in the coordinates.

40:35.400 --> 40:40.220
 Then you've got the two big, um, there's a, there's a technical word, word for it, but

40:40.220 --> 40:44.540
 basically wheels and one does the trajectory, you know, you do your, and you're just kind

40:44.540 --> 40:46.700
 of doing this and you're watching the watch in it.

40:46.700 --> 40:50.160
 And once you hit your target, that's, you know, it'll tell you that's where you need

40:50.160 --> 40:51.160
 to hit.

40:51.160 --> 40:56.040
 Do you know if there's any like AI stuff like computer vision, like where there's cameras

40:56.040 --> 41:03.280
 and they help you target using like all different kinds of cameras to see through like the fog,

41:03.280 --> 41:04.280
 all those kinds of things.

41:04.280 --> 41:10.560
 We use, um, the FOO, which are Forward Observation Officers, which are an artillery individual

41:10.560 --> 41:14.080
 that is embedded with an infantry unit.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.080
 Oh wow.

41:15.080 --> 41:16.080
 Okay.

41:16.080 --> 41:19.000
 They call from the front, give us their grid coordinates and basically say like, don't

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
 drop this on us.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
 Got it.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.080
 So, well, you know what not to shoot, which parts not to shoot.

41:24.080 --> 41:25.080
 Correct.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.080
 And then.

41:26.080 --> 41:27.080
 As long as no one moves.

41:27.080 --> 41:28.080
 Don't move.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.080
 Stay still.

41:29.080 --> 41:32.840
 But you can hear it coming, but you can't hear it until it's too close.

41:32.840 --> 41:35.160
 So like when I went, sorry, go ahead, you were going to say something.

41:35.160 --> 41:39.960
 No, I was going to say, what's the experience on the other, like, what does it feel like

41:39.960 --> 41:44.640
 to be maybe infantry or underneath it, underneath the artillery?

41:44.640 --> 41:52.360
 Well, I, I had the rare opportunity to do that and I have a video I'll show you after.

41:52.360 --> 41:57.460
 It's terrifying because I know the people that are shooting it and I know them personally

41:57.460 --> 42:00.680
 and I know what they're like as humans and for the most part they're dialed.

42:00.680 --> 42:05.240
 Well, you get the odd duck where you're like, I've seen people have an ND, which is a negligent

42:05.240 --> 42:06.720
 discharge.

42:06.720 --> 42:08.000
 You basically get charged for it.

42:08.000 --> 42:12.760
 You get in a lot of trouble because you can blow people up and it like accidents happen.

42:12.760 --> 42:15.880
 And so I know accidents can happen in stressful situations.

42:15.880 --> 42:19.960
 And when I was with the Brits, we had to call danger, close artillery.

42:19.960 --> 42:23.640
 And when it goes over top of you, it sounds like thunder and lightning.

42:23.640 --> 42:28.920
 So you fire it and it's not the stereotype that you hear in World War II where it kind

42:28.920 --> 42:34.080
 of like that, it's more of like a crackle.

42:34.080 --> 42:38.960
 And then you just hear like a whiz and it shit just goes everywhere.

42:38.960 --> 42:39.960
 It's loud.

42:39.960 --> 42:41.280
 It shakes the ground.

42:41.280 --> 42:42.280
 It shakes you.

42:42.280 --> 42:44.400
 It, you feel it.

42:44.400 --> 42:46.280
 Okay.

42:46.280 --> 42:50.920
 Is there some more words you can put to like the experience of what it's like to be in

42:50.920 --> 42:53.760
 the heat of, of, of battle there?

42:53.760 --> 42:57.280
 So what is, is there literally, is it hot?

42:57.280 --> 42:58.280
 Is it

42:58.280 --> 42:59.720
 like being under it or shooting it?

42:59.720 --> 43:00.720
 Under it.

43:00.720 --> 43:01.720
 Oh yeah.

43:01.720 --> 43:02.720
 It, 55 degree heat.

43:02.720 --> 43:04.880
 You're, you know that you're waiting for it to be called.

43:04.880 --> 43:10.220
 You feel an overwhelming excitement to start because for me, I'd never been under it.

43:10.220 --> 43:12.760
 So I was like, okay, I had my camera ready.

43:12.760 --> 43:16.760
 Like I was a kid at a candy store and I'm like, I want to watch this happen.

43:16.760 --> 43:21.440
 And once you hear the crackle, I got really fearful.

43:21.440 --> 43:24.760
 My anxiety kicked up significantly.

43:24.760 --> 43:28.900
 I got to the point where I got numb.

43:28.900 --> 43:32.960
 Like I was, my nerves were on overdrive so much that like my body would go like numb.

43:32.960 --> 43:35.600
 Like I couldn't move, but like my nerves were numb.

43:35.600 --> 43:36.600
 If that makes sense.

43:36.600 --> 43:42.400
 What, what were the nerves like and we're talking about fear or is it just anxious excitement?

43:42.400 --> 43:45.840
 Anxious excitement, hopeful that they wouldn't blow it up on us.

43:45.840 --> 43:52.560
 And there was this, there was this excitement that's hard to describe because you don't

43:52.560 --> 43:55.880
 want to be excited that you're dropping bombs on people.

43:55.880 --> 44:00.200
 But when you just saw their faces and they're shooting at you, there's this overwhelming

44:00.200 --> 44:02.920
 feeling of got you motherfucker.

44:02.920 --> 44:03.920
 Yeah.

44:03.920 --> 44:04.920
 Yeah.

44:04.920 --> 44:10.400
 Well, we'll talk about that because that's such a difficult thing about wars.

44:10.400 --> 44:15.680
 You forget that it's other human beings because those other human beings are doing really

44:15.680 --> 44:16.960
 bad things to you.

44:16.960 --> 44:23.400
 And so the very basic anger takes over, hate can take over.

44:23.400 --> 44:31.040
 And then also just the excitement of almost like video game like, you know, aspect of

44:31.040 --> 44:35.880
 war, like sport, it's like sport that all of those elements are all baked in and it's

44:35.880 --> 44:40.000
 hard to be philosophical in that situation it seems like.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.040
 I've never played video games so I can't compare it to that.

44:43.040 --> 44:46.580
 But like from, from like a sports perspective, yeah, I could, I could argue that.

44:46.580 --> 44:52.440
 Like I felt like we won there for a second and it's, it's not just like a heat from outside.

44:52.440 --> 44:59.840
 It's like this radiation within you that is something I've never felt since.

44:59.840 --> 45:05.120
 You just to take a small step back to the weapons training, what, what kind of guns

45:05.120 --> 45:06.320
 did you train on?

45:06.320 --> 45:08.120
 Because you also mentioned a rocket launcher.

45:08.120 --> 45:10.480
 I love Carl Grossoff's.

45:10.480 --> 45:11.480
 What are those?

45:11.480 --> 45:12.480
 What are those?

45:12.480 --> 45:13.480
 Carl G.

45:13.480 --> 45:14.480
 Carl G's?

45:14.480 --> 45:15.480
 What's that?

45:15.480 --> 45:19.480
 What's it like, my only experience with the rocket launchers is from the movie Commando

45:19.480 --> 45:20.480
 with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

45:20.480 --> 45:21.480
 Oh yeah.

45:21.480 --> 45:22.480
 And we've all discussed.

45:22.480 --> 45:23.480
 I haven't seen that yet.

45:23.480 --> 45:24.480
 And I've heard about it and people have made me tell.

45:24.480 --> 45:25.480
 Yeah, I know.

45:25.480 --> 45:30.560
 I feel like you haven't seen a single movie that's relevant to war military because every

45:30.560 --> 45:33.080
 time anyone brings it up, you say you haven't seen it.

45:33.080 --> 45:35.120
 I don't have time to watch movies, Lex.

45:35.120 --> 45:36.120
 Platoon.

45:36.120 --> 45:38.640
 You haven't seen Platoon, which is, you're the scientist.

45:38.640 --> 45:40.240
 How do you have the time?

45:40.240 --> 45:41.240
 I'm not a scientist.

45:41.240 --> 45:43.240
 I just play one on TV.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.240
 Okay.

45:44.240 --> 45:45.240
 Sure.

45:45.240 --> 45:51.000
 So what, can you talk about the rocket launcher and maybe any other, for both engineering

45:51.000 --> 45:55.040
 actually, to me, those guns are very interesting from an engineering perspective too.

45:55.040 --> 45:56.080
 Well, they should be.

45:56.080 --> 46:00.280
 They're fascinating when you take them apart and you see how small the parts get down to

46:00.280 --> 46:03.880
 and how necessary every single little piece is to make that thing run.

46:03.880 --> 46:08.960
 And even without the tiniest little BB smaller than a piece on there, an artillery gun might

46:08.960 --> 46:10.240
 not run.

46:10.240 --> 46:17.120
 So we were trained on Carl G's, I think called M72s, which are disposable rocket launchers.

46:17.120 --> 46:18.280
 I'll back up.

46:18.280 --> 46:23.680
 Carl G's are around, I don't know the exact millimeter of the round.

46:23.680 --> 46:24.800
 It's been a while since I shot them.

46:24.800 --> 46:26.660
 We only did those in training.

46:26.660 --> 46:31.960
 But essentially it takes, most people, one person can fire it, effectively hold it and

46:31.960 --> 46:32.960
 fire it.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.400
 It takes another person to load it.

46:34.400 --> 46:39.840
 So you put it onto your shoulder and it weighs, I would, I don't know, 30 pounds, 40 pounds.

46:39.840 --> 46:40.840
 Oh, wow.

46:40.840 --> 46:41.840
 Can't remember.

46:41.840 --> 46:42.840
 It's been a minute.

46:42.840 --> 46:43.840
 It's been a minute.

46:43.840 --> 46:44.840
 But one person can carry it.

46:44.840 --> 46:45.840
 Oh, yeah.

46:45.840 --> 46:46.840
 Okay.

46:46.840 --> 46:47.840
 I don't know.

46:47.840 --> 46:53.760
 It just seems like a rocket launcher is a pretty intense kind of device that just.

46:53.760 --> 46:54.760
 It for sure is.

46:54.760 --> 46:58.760
 I mean, it's the diameter, I can't even tell you the diameter, they're about that big.

46:58.760 --> 46:59.760
 I mean.

46:59.760 --> 47:00.760
 And it goes on your shoulder.

47:00.760 --> 47:04.560
 It goes on your shoulder and then it has a little sight that pops out.

47:04.560 --> 47:07.400
 That's almost like plastic like, which is kind of funny because it reminds me of like

47:07.400 --> 47:11.120
 the little green army men.

47:11.120 --> 47:13.160
 I just felt so flimsy to me.

47:13.160 --> 47:15.240
 I was like, this is hilarious.

47:15.240 --> 47:17.500
 And then another person stands behind you and opens the hatch.

47:17.500 --> 47:23.040
 And so there's this, there's these two levers and you just kind of open it.

47:23.040 --> 47:28.320
 And then the back end, which is flared, so it's just a tube and then it's flared.

47:28.320 --> 47:32.200
 That will open it and drop down and you load a round into that and then you load it back

47:32.200 --> 47:33.200
 up.

47:33.200 --> 47:34.200
 Got it.

47:34.200 --> 47:38.040
 And you're never supposed to stand behind it because the blast behind it will kill you.

47:38.040 --> 47:40.080
 It's yeah.

47:40.080 --> 47:46.280
 But in my case, when I fired it, it was me and another individual, I want to say it wasn't

47:46.280 --> 47:49.640
 Sarah Pellegrin, but it was another girl that was smaller.

47:49.640 --> 47:54.040
 And the person is supposed to wrap around your waist and tuck low and hold your stability.

47:54.040 --> 47:58.320
 And we were just aiming at tanks that day and they were just concrete heads.

47:58.320 --> 48:02.480
 So they would just either, they would hit and bounce off or whatever.

48:02.480 --> 48:07.720
 And so when my sergeant saw that, he just kind of looked at both of us and was like,

48:07.720 --> 48:08.920
 no, I'm just going to.

48:08.920 --> 48:14.560
 And he got real low and just like wrapped both of us and then we'd fire it.

48:14.560 --> 48:21.120
 And it feels like you're getting punched in the side of the head on repeat by Jocko.

48:21.120 --> 48:27.320
 You lose all your hearing, like just, snot comes out of your nose and you're just kind

48:27.320 --> 48:29.720
 of discombobulated for a minute.

48:29.720 --> 48:32.400
 It's a real mind fuck.

48:32.400 --> 48:39.720
 Is there any other kind of guns that at that time, because you were new to this, you haven't

48:39.720 --> 48:44.440
 shot guns when you were younger that were really impressive to you in the training process?

48:44.440 --> 48:46.740
 All of them, because I've never fired a weapon.

48:46.740 --> 48:52.560
 So we had the C7s, which are like your M16s, I believe, the long barrel.

48:52.560 --> 48:57.280
 The cute thing about those is when I have that slung, my barrel drags on the ground.

48:57.280 --> 48:59.240
 So that's fun.

48:59.240 --> 49:02.640
 And they shoot your 7.62 or your 5.56 round.

49:02.640 --> 49:03.640
 I loved that.

49:03.640 --> 49:08.920
 I preferred the C8, which was a short barrel, which is what the SF guys use.

49:08.920 --> 49:13.320
 Not because it's cooler looking, which it obviously is, but because it was functional

49:13.320 --> 49:16.840
 for my body height and it didn't drag on the ground when I ran.

49:16.840 --> 49:17.840
 I loved those.

49:17.840 --> 49:19.920
 They're your personal weapon.

49:19.920 --> 49:22.780
 Being an artillery gunner, if you're not an officer, at least in our unit, you didn't

49:22.780 --> 49:25.280
 get a side piece.

49:25.280 --> 49:27.680
 I didn't have a slide piece, Lex.

49:27.680 --> 49:30.800
 So I never had a handgun of any type.

49:30.800 --> 49:32.000
 I fired those in training.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.320
 You can't get over that side piece comment.

49:33.320 --> 49:34.320
 Look at you.

49:34.320 --> 49:36.880
 I was going to say, I know what a side piece is.

49:36.880 --> 49:37.880
 You don't have to explain to me.

49:37.880 --> 49:38.880
 But you're single.

49:38.880 --> 49:41.720
 So how do you even have a side piece if you don't have a main piece?

49:41.720 --> 49:46.240
 The joke would be the fact that we have a total misunderstanding what side piece is.

49:46.240 --> 49:47.240
 Okay, great.

49:47.240 --> 49:48.840
 So you didn't have a side piece as a non officer.

49:48.840 --> 49:49.840
 Right.

49:49.840 --> 49:51.200
 So I never fired those much.

49:51.200 --> 49:52.520
 We did grenades in training.

49:52.520 --> 49:53.520
 Oh, cool.

49:53.520 --> 49:54.520
 Yeah, grenades are fun.

49:54.520 --> 49:55.520
 I love grenades.

49:55.520 --> 49:56.860
 I have a massive one tattooed on me.

49:56.860 --> 49:58.320
 I have them all over my office.

49:58.320 --> 50:00.520
 How does a grenade work?

50:00.520 --> 50:02.340
 There's the spoon and the pin.

50:02.340 --> 50:08.480
 So this the pin holds the spoon in place when you pull that pin, the firing mechanism inside

50:08.480 --> 50:13.560
 as long as that the spoon is up against it, it won't fire as soon as that spoon goes.

50:13.560 --> 50:16.760
 I believe it causes a reaction on the inside.

50:16.760 --> 50:18.520
 And you've got about five seconds to check it.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.920
 You'd be better to ask that question too.

50:20.920 --> 50:22.680
 I don't mean to get philosophical on this.

50:22.680 --> 50:23.680
 No, you're not.

50:23.680 --> 50:30.280
 There's something about a grenade, because you're essentially committing suicide.

50:30.280 --> 50:32.520
 Unless you get rid of the thing.

50:32.520 --> 50:33.520
 There's something like

50:33.520 --> 50:36.820
 or if you're unlucky, and it just goes off when you pull the pin, which has happened

50:36.820 --> 50:37.820
 to tons of people.

50:37.820 --> 50:41.120
 So it just feels like a very kind of leap.

50:41.120 --> 50:45.680
 It's a dangerous leap into the abyss every time you use the thing.

50:45.680 --> 50:50.040
 Because when you shoot a gun, like the gun is much less likely to malfunction in terms

50:50.040 --> 50:52.480
 of like all the possible ways to go wrong.

50:52.480 --> 50:55.000
 It just seems like grenade is like

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
 primitive almost.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.560
 Yeah, it's primitive.

50:57.560 --> 51:01.920
 It's also real, like in a way that like a bar fight is like being punched in the face

51:01.920 --> 51:02.920
 is real.

51:02.920 --> 51:05.960
 It's like you're here with a weapon of destruction.

51:05.960 --> 51:07.440
 It's just you and the thing.

51:07.440 --> 51:08.760
 Yeah, you have to get rid of it.

51:08.760 --> 51:09.760
 I don't know.

51:09.760 --> 51:11.240
 Is that is that terrifying to you?

51:11.240 --> 51:13.840
 Like do people still use grenades in warfare?

51:13.840 --> 51:14.840
 Oh, yeah.

51:14.840 --> 51:15.840
 Okay.

51:15.840 --> 51:16.840
 Yeah, those are fantastic.

51:16.840 --> 51:20.120
 The Taliban were throwing them over the wall at the airport in Kabul.

51:20.120 --> 51:23.040
 People use them all the time because when you're in Afghanistan, if you're in a rural

51:23.040 --> 51:26.020
 area, you're going from village to village and they're, they're, you know, they're mud

51:26.020 --> 51:30.480
 hot walls, like they're tall, but you're walking through corridors and stuff, all you got to

51:30.480 --> 51:33.840
 lob one of those is going to take the whole unit out that just walked by like it's, they're

51:33.840 --> 51:39.760
 accurate if you're close enough and they're effective if you're close enough.

51:39.760 --> 51:41.640
 I love them though.

51:41.640 --> 51:47.960
 I think they're fascinating to me because they're such a tiny little thing with such

51:47.960 --> 51:48.960
 devastation.

51:48.960 --> 51:51.160
 Yeah, they just can cause such devastation.

51:51.160 --> 51:55.520
 But for me, when I had them, the some of the Canadians would make fun of me because when

51:55.520 --> 51:59.280
 I did go outside the wire with the British, I had two right here.

51:59.280 --> 52:04.560
 And I remember I put a piece of tape over the spoons because in my mind, I could picture

52:04.560 --> 52:10.160
 myself searching someone and grabbing me and pulling that and that would be me that that

52:10.160 --> 52:15.580
 would have been like, yep, that if anyone that was going to happen to was her for sure.

52:15.580 --> 52:21.240
 So you were deployed to Afghanistan in 2009, okay.

52:21.240 --> 52:26.240
 And like we said, you were in great, no, perfect physical shape.

52:26.240 --> 52:27.240
 Fucking epic shape.

52:27.240 --> 52:31.360
 Epic shape, six pack or, I mean, yeah, okay.

52:31.360 --> 52:37.840
 So you could do pull up, a lot of pull ups and push ups and yeah, okay.

52:37.840 --> 52:43.580
 And well trained, would you say, were you already what like, no, no, no, I'll argue

52:43.580 --> 52:45.800
 that point till I'm blue in the face.

52:45.800 --> 52:47.920
 I spoke to recently, I actually spoke to my sergeant.

52:47.920 --> 52:48.920
 He's not a sergeant anymore.

52:48.920 --> 52:51.760
 But Sergeant Mark LeBlanc, he's in Africa right now on a deployment.

52:51.760 --> 52:52.760
 He gave me a call the other day.

52:52.760 --> 52:54.840
 And I remember talking to him about this.

52:54.840 --> 52:58.760
 And it's frustrating because we were at an active war.

52:58.760 --> 53:03.360
 We were sorry, we were involved in an active war where we the units that I were in were

53:03.360 --> 53:07.420
 tagged red, which meant they needed people.

53:07.420 --> 53:12.240
 So when you need people, things go quick, whether or not that's right.

53:12.240 --> 53:15.920
 I mean, you could argue that's the similar thing to what's happening in the world right

53:15.920 --> 53:16.920
 now.

53:16.920 --> 53:18.080
 We needed a vaccine.

53:18.080 --> 53:19.880
 We got a vaccine.

53:19.880 --> 53:21.600
 Is it the best it could be?

53:21.600 --> 53:22.920
 Could it be better?

53:22.920 --> 53:23.920
 Could it do more things?

53:23.920 --> 53:24.920
 Sure, probably.

53:24.920 --> 53:29.340
 But with the time that we had, we did the best that we could.

53:29.340 --> 53:31.060
 That's my logic on that.

53:31.060 --> 53:35.480
 For me, I joined the military in November of 2007.

53:35.480 --> 53:38.840
 I was in basic training in January of 2008.

53:38.840 --> 53:43.120
 I was graduated basic SQ, which is all your weapons training.

53:43.120 --> 53:47.520
 Your DP1, which is your trade specific training.

53:47.520 --> 53:51.360
 So whatever trade you're going to go into, whether it's infantry, armored, artillery,

53:51.360 --> 53:54.180
 medic, whatever, that's your DP1.

53:54.180 --> 53:56.480
 It's called different things in different units.

53:56.480 --> 54:00.360
 And then I got posted to my unit in September.

54:00.360 --> 54:03.320
 So January to September, I had done all my training.

54:03.320 --> 54:05.780
 And I'm an English speaking individual.

54:05.780 --> 54:10.520
 I got posted to a French unit that only speaks French and had to learn all of the weapons

54:10.520 --> 54:15.720
 systems, everything, again, that I just learned in that short time frame in French.

54:15.720 --> 54:21.480
 This part of your story that you're telling this to Jaco is one way to say it is very

54:21.480 --> 54:24.880
 impressive that you had to learn all of this in French.

54:24.880 --> 54:28.960
 So there's also the camaraderie, the social aspect of it, which is difficult, probably.

54:28.960 --> 54:29.960
 I didn't have any.

54:29.960 --> 54:32.360
 Yeah, I didn't have any.

54:32.360 --> 54:37.440
 But it also would make you a more effective soldier to be socially, for that cohesion

54:37.440 --> 54:39.280
 to be there, right?

54:39.280 --> 54:42.400
 But also just understanding the basic terminology.

54:42.400 --> 54:43.400
 Correct.

54:43.400 --> 54:48.040
 The right way to say something on the radio, the right way to run a gun, the right way

54:48.040 --> 54:52.540
 to, because you got to move with those guns, you got seven people.

54:52.540 --> 54:54.840
 It's really magical.

54:54.840 --> 54:56.200
 I'll send you a video.

54:56.200 --> 55:00.380
 When we did some live fire in workup training in Texas before we left, we did a competition

55:00.380 --> 55:05.680
 between the other gun to see who could fire 10 rounds faster.

55:05.680 --> 55:12.960
 It is truly beautiful to watch an artillery unit fire a gun because it's like a symphony.

55:12.960 --> 55:16.400
 Everyone has their parts and everyone knows and everyone's yelling, but they know why

55:16.400 --> 55:20.880
 they're yelling and everyone, this guy's got to do this in order for this guy to load the

55:20.880 --> 55:21.880
 round.

55:21.880 --> 55:22.880
 It's just, it's beautiful.

55:22.880 --> 55:23.960
 It really is.

55:23.960 --> 55:25.120
 It is gorgeous to watch.

55:25.120 --> 55:26.120
 I miss it deeply.

55:26.120 --> 55:30.920
 Is there, by the way, for a gun, is there like one person responsible for the, for

55:30.920 --> 55:36.440
 the aim and the, or like the specification of the location and somebody else that pulls

55:36.440 --> 55:37.440
 it, presses the button?

55:37.440 --> 55:38.440
 The lanyard.

55:38.440 --> 55:39.440
 Is that the lanyard?

55:39.440 --> 55:40.440
 The button.

55:40.440 --> 55:41.440
 Is there a button?

55:41.440 --> 55:42.440
 It's better than a button.

55:42.440 --> 55:43.440
 You'll like it.

55:43.440 --> 55:44.440
 I'll tell you in a second.

55:44.440 --> 55:45.440
 Okay.

55:45.440 --> 55:51.120
 There's your Sergeant in charge and then they have their two IC and so the comms come in

55:51.120 --> 55:57.120
 to the Sergeant and the Sergeant is the, or your Master Bombardier, Bombardier Chef.

55:57.120 --> 55:58.120
 Yeah.

55:58.120 --> 55:59.120
 Sorry.

55:59.120 --> 56:00.120
 What?

56:00.120 --> 56:01.120
 Bombardier Chef?

56:01.120 --> 56:02.120
 What?

56:02.120 --> 56:03.120
 Bombardier Chef.

56:03.120 --> 56:04.120
 Bombardier Chef.

56:04.120 --> 56:05.120
 Oh, that's the French.

56:05.120 --> 56:06.120
 Master Bombardier.

56:06.120 --> 56:07.120
 Yeah.

56:07.120 --> 56:10.920
 So it goes like private in the North, like in an infantry or in a regular unit, it's

56:10.920 --> 56:15.300
 like private corporal, Master Corporal Sergeant.

56:15.300 --> 56:22.660
 In artillery, it goes Gunner, Bombardier, Master Bombardier, Sergeant and off like that.

56:22.660 --> 56:27.420
 So you have two people, but the Sarge is like, you don't move till he says move.

56:27.420 --> 56:29.120
 You don't fire till he says fire.

56:29.120 --> 56:30.120
 Like he's your guy.

56:30.120 --> 56:31.120
 He'll give you the coordinates.

56:31.120 --> 56:34.760
 He'll feed them to the guy that's doing the GPS, that portion.

56:34.760 --> 56:36.120
 I really never did it much.

56:36.120 --> 56:38.240
 I wasn't tall enough to see it.

56:38.240 --> 56:40.560
 Like legitimately the way, how high it is up on the gun.

56:40.560 --> 56:42.840
 Like it was, I couldn't see clearly enough.

56:42.840 --> 56:44.480
 It was not good.

56:44.480 --> 56:48.000
 So obviously you have a big personality, you're a strong person.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
 You don't say.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.800
 And you have a big hat currently.

56:51.800 --> 56:54.400
 I always wear a hat, Lex.

56:54.400 --> 56:57.480
 It seems like your height and your size was a factor.

56:57.480 --> 56:58.560
 Oh, for sure.

56:58.560 --> 57:04.560
 How were you able to step up in all those moments and how difficult was it?

57:04.560 --> 57:07.600
 I don't know that I realized it was difficult while I was doing it because that's just the

57:07.600 --> 57:08.600
 way it's been.

57:08.600 --> 57:10.000
 I've always been the short person.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.580
 That's life.

57:11.580 --> 57:12.580
 Nothing I can do to fix that.

57:12.580 --> 57:13.580
 So there was no point.

57:13.580 --> 57:14.580
 Am I going to whine about it?

57:14.580 --> 57:18.000
 I'm going to break my femurs and insert things to make me grow a little bit.

57:18.000 --> 57:22.520
 Maybe, maybe since you're in robotics, you can figure that out.

57:22.520 --> 57:24.400
 That's your task now.

57:24.400 --> 57:28.600
 Make me be five foot three, that'd be great.

57:28.600 --> 57:33.960
 For artillery, really what it came down to was the unit when I got there, there was only

57:33.960 --> 57:38.920
 a couple of people who spoke any sort of English and my Sergeant was not one of them.

57:38.920 --> 57:43.920
 But once he kind of started to get to know me a little bit, the best that he could, he

57:43.920 --> 57:49.880
 started to put effort into making sure I could lift the rounds, make sure my capacity to

57:49.880 --> 57:51.800
 do my job was there.

57:51.800 --> 57:54.280
 And so he took me under his wing in that aspect.

57:54.280 --> 58:01.080
 So he would take me to the gym with him and he would show me exercises that would specifically

58:01.080 --> 58:03.760
 help me load the round.

58:03.760 --> 58:07.840
 So pick the round up from the ground, pick it up like a trick to put your knee under

58:07.840 --> 58:12.360
 it, use your legs instead of just pick it up, use your back, pull your back out.

58:12.360 --> 58:13.820
 He would work on that.

58:13.820 --> 58:18.800
 And then depending on the position I was running the gun in, if I was running the side that

58:18.800 --> 58:23.000
 had the charge bags, I'll explain that in a second, but if I was running the side that

58:23.000 --> 58:31.560
 had the charge bags, I could step up onto the gun and if I leaned inward enough with

58:31.560 --> 58:39.000
 my right hand with the charge and I kind of kicked off, I could kind of jump and shove

58:39.000 --> 58:41.680
 it up the tube.

58:41.680 --> 58:42.680
 Almost enough.

58:42.680 --> 58:43.680
 Yeah.

58:43.680 --> 58:47.360
 If I was running the lanyard, which is the thing that makes it go boom, it's really easy.

58:47.360 --> 58:49.140
 It's a long rope.

58:49.140 --> 58:53.600
 You hook it on and you put your right hand on your hip and on your left and you hold

58:53.600 --> 58:57.360
 it there and you just stare at your Sergeant like this and you just wait for him to yell

58:57.360 --> 58:59.940
 fire and he points at you when he does it.

58:59.940 --> 59:03.480
 And when you do it, you turn your whole body with it.

59:03.480 --> 59:09.520
 And when you do that, it alleviates a misfire essentially because if you just pull it sometimes

59:09.520 --> 59:10.520
 that's not enough.

59:10.520 --> 59:12.740
 You got to really give it your whole body into it.

59:12.740 --> 59:18.680
 And so he would train me on how to do things differently so that I could do them effectively

59:18.680 --> 59:20.800
 and I wasn't a shit pump.

59:20.800 --> 59:22.140
 A what?

59:22.140 --> 59:26.040
 So shit pump is a term that we use in Canada to call somebody useless.

59:26.040 --> 59:32.160
 A shit pump is a useless soldier who is just, you're there and that's the shit pump and

59:32.160 --> 59:33.960
 so we all just deal with it.

59:33.960 --> 59:35.880
 But somehow they're still there.

59:35.880 --> 59:36.880
 Yeah.

59:36.880 --> 59:37.880
 What were we talking about?

59:37.880 --> 59:38.880
 The lanyard.

59:38.880 --> 59:39.880
 Okay.

59:39.880 --> 59:40.880
 Yeah.

59:40.880 --> 59:41.880
 We were talking about the artillery guns.

59:41.880 --> 59:48.160
 So those things though, what you would find fascinating is just how they break down when

59:48.160 --> 59:49.560
 you have to take one of those apart.

59:49.560 --> 59:55.400
 I think your mind would really find it fascinating how a breach comes apart all the way down

59:55.400 --> 59:59.960
 to like ball bearing size and the only, and there's a way to just make that gun complete

59:59.960 --> 1:00:05.760
 ineffective and all you have to do when you're on the charge side, there's a magazine that's

1:00:05.760 --> 1:00:09.240
 a long linear magazine and it holds like 15 little rounds.

1:00:09.240 --> 1:00:13.080
 If you just take that thing out, that thing's not firing.

1:00:13.080 --> 1:00:14.840
 How many people does it take to move that?

1:00:14.840 --> 1:00:16.440
 Like how easy is it to move that thing?

1:00:16.440 --> 1:00:17.440
 To move a triple seven?

1:00:17.440 --> 1:00:18.440
 A triple seven.

1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:19.440
 I like it.

1:00:19.440 --> 1:00:20.440
 Well that's what they're called.

1:00:20.440 --> 1:00:21.440
 M triple sevens.

1:00:21.440 --> 1:00:25.160
 Is a lot of the terminology crossover the same in English and French?

1:00:25.160 --> 1:00:26.160
 Okay.

1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:30.480
 I mean, M triple seven does cause it's an obvious how it's, or I'm sure it has a separate

1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:33.500
 word, but like if you're running it, you're running it in French.

1:00:33.500 --> 1:00:40.160
 So like when I'd be running the, when I'm doing the charge bags and I'm doing, I'm doing,

1:00:40.160 --> 1:00:43.900
 you know, I'm loading everything and I'm getting that ready and that's my position that day,

1:00:43.900 --> 1:00:46.760
 I'm also controlling the breach.

1:00:46.760 --> 1:00:50.320
 So like how it opens, how it closes when it locks.

1:00:50.320 --> 1:00:52.820
 And so, but you have to yell that as you do it.

1:00:52.820 --> 1:00:57.480
 So you're yelling like, like you have to yell all these things.

1:00:57.480 --> 1:00:59.100
 You have to learn them though.

1:00:59.100 --> 1:01:03.480
 And so for a long time, it's, it's, it's, it was a little frustrating.

1:01:03.480 --> 1:01:04.480
 I won't lie.

1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:05.480
 It's really exciting.

1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:09.880
 I took a lot of French, but I forgot all of it, but I think it's a beautiful romantic

1:01:09.880 --> 1:01:10.880
 language.

1:01:10.880 --> 1:01:11.880
 It's a good language.

1:01:11.880 --> 1:01:14.040
 If it's from Quebec, it's a, yeah, that's true.

1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:16.320
 It's a good language to fall in love with.

1:01:16.320 --> 1:01:21.080
 Not as good as Russian, but I mean, English is, all right.

1:01:21.080 --> 1:01:24.280
 I mean, Russian, are we really, is that like a love language?

1:01:24.280 --> 1:01:25.280
 It is to me.

1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:28.920
 I mean, because you're Russian, but like if somebody walked up to me, it was like, Hey,

1:01:28.920 --> 1:01:33.100
 Kelsey, I like you, I'd be like, Oh God, he's going to put me in a camp.

1:01:33.100 --> 1:01:35.320
 That's because you don't understand love, Kelsey.

1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:36.320
 I don't.

1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:37.320
 We'll talk about that.

1:01:37.320 --> 1:01:38.320
 Okay.

1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:40.120
 How many people does it take to move the M777?

1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:41.120
 It depends.

1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:43.640
 If you're moving it by ground, you're moving it on a truck and when you're moving it on

1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:48.080
 a truck, you're hooking the back of it onto, you're hooking the front of the barrel onto

1:01:48.080 --> 1:01:53.080
 one of those big transport looking trucks that has those cargo tents that's got soldiers

1:01:53.080 --> 1:01:54.080
 in it.

1:01:54.080 --> 1:01:57.000
 You don't want to ever move an M777 by that way, if you don't have to.

1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:58.760
 The barrel is worth a million dollars.

1:01:58.760 --> 1:01:59.760
 Wow.

1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:00.760
 Okay.

1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:02.040
 So this is like a serious piece of equipment.

1:02:02.040 --> 1:02:03.240
 You don't want to move them.

1:02:03.240 --> 1:02:04.240
 Okay.

1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:07.800
 When we got to Kandahar, we were there for a couple of days.

1:02:07.800 --> 1:02:12.240
 We got flown out to the FOB we were going to be at, forward observation base.

1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:16.860
 Kandahar is the safe space or was the major base in Afghanistan that we were at.

1:02:16.860 --> 1:02:19.140
 There's things like Tim Hortons there.

1:02:19.140 --> 1:02:20.920
 There's Canada house.

1:02:20.920 --> 1:02:24.280
 There's a British side, an American side, a Canadian side, and that's where you see

1:02:24.280 --> 1:02:26.940
 all the different countries in the world kind of come together.

1:02:26.940 --> 1:02:30.480
 You would see Italians, you would see Germans, you would see French, you would see all these

1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:33.600
 different uniforms and you never know who to salute because you don't know what each

1:02:33.600 --> 1:02:34.600
 thing means.

1:02:34.600 --> 1:02:36.480
 It doesn't feel like a war zone.

1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:37.480
 No.

1:02:37.480 --> 1:02:38.480
 Oh God, no.

1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:39.480
 There's a boardwalk.

1:02:39.480 --> 1:02:41.840
 There's hockey there, like floor hockey because Canada had to have that.

1:02:41.840 --> 1:02:46.880
 There's a Tim Hortons, a Subway, a Pizza Hut, a PX.

1:02:46.880 --> 1:02:51.440
 I think there's a restaurant there somewhere, but I didn't get to go.

1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:52.440
 Stuff like that.

1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:53.440
 There's gyms.

1:02:53.440 --> 1:02:54.440
 You can run around it.

1:02:54.440 --> 1:02:55.440
 You feel fairly safe.

1:02:55.440 --> 1:02:57.400
 You always have a weapon on you, but you can live your life.

1:02:57.400 --> 1:03:02.120
 When you get out to the FOB, the guns are already there.

1:03:02.120 --> 1:03:04.560
 Those M777s get lifted by a Chinook.

1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:07.760
 Normally if they're going by air, they go by Chinook because they're heavy as hell.

1:03:07.760 --> 1:03:12.160
 And Chinooks can hook them under the bottom and they fly them and then they'll drop them

1:03:12.160 --> 1:03:13.160
 down.

1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:18.320
 They have wheels on them, but you don't need them if you're going to leave it in place.

1:03:18.320 --> 1:03:19.320
 Got it.

1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:21.680
 And you're getting information about IEDs.

1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:25.080
 You're getting a lay of the land as to what's been going on in the country for the past

1:03:25.080 --> 1:03:26.360
 six months.

1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:30.040
 And this, you know nothing, you're just like, this is your first time you're getting deployed.

1:03:30.040 --> 1:03:31.600
 So what was your deployment like?

1:03:31.600 --> 1:03:36.840
 Can you tell the story of your deployment to Afghanistan?

1:03:36.840 --> 1:03:39.120
 Like the whole deployment?

1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:42.200
 Getting like actual deploying, not the deployment itself.

1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:43.600
 What's the difference between the two?

1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:46.520
 Well actually getting ready to deploy is a little different.

1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:54.360
 So I mean the emotional buildup to it and some of the memorable things that kind of

1:03:54.360 --> 1:03:59.320
 you remember from that experience, both on the excitement, I get to see battle, I get

1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:04.680
 to be part of this and the fear and also like being surprised like with the Tim Hortons

1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:05.680
 and all those kinds of things.

1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:09.320
 So like the lead up before everything like shit hit the fan, okay cool.

1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:10.320
 So...

1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:13.920
 You're such a fascinating person, but yes, yes.

1:04:13.920 --> 1:04:14.920
 Something like that.

1:04:14.920 --> 1:04:15.920
 Yes.

1:04:15.920 --> 1:04:16.920
 I've been called...

1:04:16.920 --> 1:04:17.920
 Many things.

1:04:17.920 --> 1:04:18.920
 Yeah, fascinating.

1:04:18.920 --> 1:04:19.920
 That start with the letter F.

1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:20.920
 Yeah.

1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:21.920
 No, I don't know.

1:04:21.920 --> 1:04:25.380
 I don't know many words with F. Okay, so the buildup to the deployment.

1:04:25.380 --> 1:04:30.740
 So for the buildup for the deployment, I was in Quebec and my unit was deploying from Quebec.

1:04:30.740 --> 1:04:34.680
 And at that time you kind of get your marching orders, you know you're deploying.

1:04:34.680 --> 1:04:38.600
 I knew I was deploying before I even graduated.

1:04:38.600 --> 1:04:39.980
 That's how much they needed people.

1:04:39.980 --> 1:04:45.260
 So once I did all that training, on graduation parade day, a couple men from Quebec in uniforms

1:04:45.260 --> 1:04:49.080
 came over and said, you, you, you and you are all being posted back here today and you're

1:04:49.080 --> 1:04:51.080
 going to deploy with us in April.

1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:52.680
 So that's how I found out I was deploying.

1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:55.560
 Why was there such a need for troops in Afghanistan?

1:04:55.560 --> 1:04:59.000
 That was a well known thing that there's a scaling up of troops.

1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:02.960
 2007 on, Canada really started taking a combat role.

1:05:02.960 --> 1:05:06.600
 Before it was very much more a UN type deal where doing what we normally do in most wars

1:05:06.600 --> 1:05:10.780
 where we just, we wear blue and we don't shoot anyone.

1:05:10.780 --> 1:05:13.200
 And so we're there to help.

1:05:13.200 --> 1:05:18.080
 And so they were really, they were scaling up and there wasn't a lot of people in those

1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:20.280
 trades initially, I think when the war kind of started.

1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:22.720
 So Canada really started to scale.

1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:26.980
 And so when I got to Quebec, we've kind of found, oh yeah, we're deploying.

1:05:26.980 --> 1:05:31.360
 And it was a weird situation because I've never actually been at a unit on a non deployable

1:05:31.360 --> 1:05:32.360
 unit.

1:05:32.360 --> 1:05:33.720
 I don't know what they do day to day.

1:05:33.720 --> 1:05:34.720
 That's different from what I did.

1:05:34.720 --> 1:05:36.640
 I just know what I did.

1:05:36.640 --> 1:05:40.680
 So we would do things like in the morning we would get up and we would meet for PT at

1:05:40.680 --> 1:05:48.060
 5 a.m. and that would include going for a 10k run or playing ball hockey for a few hours

1:05:48.060 --> 1:05:53.400
 in the gym or lifting weights together or just going on a rock march, a long rock march.

1:05:53.400 --> 1:05:54.480
 Just stuff like that.

1:05:54.480 --> 1:05:59.840
 You would have a shower, you would meet and then you would just sit around the regiment.

1:05:59.840 --> 1:06:04.800
 You would just sit around the regiment and you would, if there was busy work, you'd mop

1:06:04.800 --> 1:06:07.160
 the floors, you would clean weapons.

1:06:07.160 --> 1:06:10.860
 There wasn't a whole lot until there was a whole lot to do.

1:06:10.860 --> 1:06:17.260
 We did a lot for a while and then we went away on workup training to Texas for a week.

1:06:17.260 --> 1:06:23.820
 We came down here and we did live fire with our other troop that was gonna be with us.

1:06:23.820 --> 1:06:30.960
 So Alpha had two guns and two guns has two groups of people and so we all would go down

1:06:30.960 --> 1:06:38.000
 to Texas and we did live fire here for a week and I ended up getting gastro which was awesome.

1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:39.000
 So thanks for that.

1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:43.600
 Oh apparently there was, they were having water problems and sanitary problems so everyone

1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:45.600
 was getting it on the base.

1:06:45.600 --> 1:06:48.920
 Okay so it just makes your life way harder.

1:06:48.920 --> 1:06:52.600
 I didn't get it towards the end, till towards the end so that was fortunate.

1:06:52.600 --> 1:06:56.920
 So we would fire live fire, we would go out to the middle of nowhere, the guns would be

1:06:56.920 --> 1:07:02.280
 there and we would get offloaded truck of rounds and we would do live fire and we would

1:07:02.280 --> 1:07:04.720
 practice, just constant practice.

1:07:04.720 --> 1:07:05.980
 What's that saying?

1:07:05.980 --> 1:07:07.200
 Perfect practice makes perfect.

1:07:07.200 --> 1:07:13.880
 Yeah so this is a sensory, like a shooting range for artillery, for long range.

1:07:13.880 --> 1:07:16.280
 So what does practice look like?

1:07:16.280 --> 1:07:21.660
 So you roll up in your trucks and you're, you know, you've got each group of people.

1:07:21.660 --> 1:07:24.720
 You've got two trucks and then you've got like a medic vehicle and then you've got like

1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:30.560
 an officer vehicle and a comms vehicle and you go to your perspective guns and then you

1:07:30.560 --> 1:07:37.000
 offload your ammo and then you basically wait for them to send you like a fire mission.

1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:38.000
 Wow, get that together.

1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:41.600
 They would call, they would say a mission, so it would be a fire mission.

1:07:41.600 --> 1:07:45.320
 So we'd wait for that and once we got that then you all run like a bunch of scattered

1:07:45.320 --> 1:07:50.720
 rats to the gun like it's like the greatest thing you've ever seen and then you just wait,

1:07:50.720 --> 1:07:54.440
 you wait for the call for the sergeants to say and then you'll hear it because it's not

1:07:54.440 --> 1:07:55.440
 headphones.

1:07:55.440 --> 1:07:59.720
 You can hear it on a speaker and it'd be like, I'm not going to do it in French, don't ask.

1:07:59.720 --> 1:08:09.160
 It'd be like so and so, 10 rounds, fire when ready and then you would get your rounds ready

1:08:09.160 --> 1:08:13.640
 and everyone would have them ready and would be in their respective positions and then

1:08:13.640 --> 1:08:17.560
 you would wait and then they would say fire when ready and as soon as they say fire when

1:08:17.560 --> 1:08:19.720
 ready that means just start going.

1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:22.200
 Just start and then that's when the magic starts.

1:08:22.200 --> 1:08:26.400
 You go like the loop, like you shoot one or whatever, there's a reloading process.

1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:27.400
 Yeah, there's a loop.

1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:31.080
 So what you would do, you get the fire mission, you would find out the rounds, the 2IC would

1:08:31.080 --> 1:08:34.680
 be standing by the rounds and it was his job to make sure the amount of rounds that was

1:08:34.680 --> 1:08:39.560
 told would be the only rounds that would go downrange and so he'd stand there and on each

1:08:39.560 --> 1:08:45.240
 round depending on the type of round is a fuse which gets screwed onto the top of the round.

1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:51.880
 So they're about that big and it's just a point and then you would have to put it on,

1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:57.960
 give it a spin and depending if it was a time release, you had a little, what do you call

1:08:57.960 --> 1:08:58.960
 it?

1:08:58.960 --> 1:08:59.960
 You get those at IKEA when you have to build everything.

1:08:59.960 --> 1:09:00.960
 Allen wrench?

1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:01.960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, Allen wrench.

1:09:01.960 --> 1:09:02.960
 Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:03.960
 Yeah.

1:09:03.960 --> 1:09:04.960
 But like a big one or something?

1:09:04.960 --> 1:09:07.060
 No, just a little one because it's a tiny little hole and you just got to click it to

1:09:07.060 --> 1:09:12.240
 where it's supposed to go and it depended on what the call was for and it was a timer.

1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:15.520
 When you said like wheel, you mean like a little thing then?

1:09:15.520 --> 1:09:16.520
 Is that what we're talking about?

1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:17.520
 No, no.

1:09:17.520 --> 1:09:18.520
 I'm talking about the round itself.

1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:20.480
 So you would put a fuse on top of the round.

1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:25.240
 So you would unload the ammo and then you would put fuses on them and the fuses are

1:09:25.240 --> 1:09:30.440
 on the top and they're like a little ice cream topper kind of thing and you would spin those

1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:31.440
 on.

1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:32.440
 Oh, okay.

1:09:32.440 --> 1:09:35.280
 And then once they're on, depending if it's a time release or not, you would take this

1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:39.240
 little thing and you would move it the top and that would, it's almost like a little

1:09:39.240 --> 1:09:40.240
 timer.

1:09:40.240 --> 1:09:41.240
 Cool.

1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:42.240
 That's what I did.

1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:43.840
 So you're assembling a bullet.

1:09:43.840 --> 1:09:44.840
 Essentially.

1:09:44.840 --> 1:09:47.240
 A very big one that goes up to my waist.

1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:48.240
 Cool.

1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:49.240
 Yes.

1:09:49.240 --> 1:09:50.240
 This is very cool.

1:09:50.240 --> 1:09:51.240
 And you're a fascinating person.

1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:52.240
 Okay.

1:09:52.240 --> 1:09:55.720
 So just that you still even years later have all this in your memory.

1:09:55.720 --> 1:10:00.200
 It's not all perfectly accurate and that's what irritates me though is because it bothers

1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:04.920
 me when I can't remember things accurately but I have a lot of, I've had a lot of memory

1:10:04.920 --> 1:10:09.000
 issues and problems after like having too many hits to the head and...

1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:10.880
 This is from earlier in childhood or later?

1:10:10.880 --> 1:10:11.880
 But both.

1:10:11.880 --> 1:10:12.880
 Okay.

1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:13.880
 Both.

1:10:13.880 --> 1:10:14.880
 The military did not help it.

1:10:14.880 --> 1:10:18.160
 Where was the hits in the head in the military?

1:10:18.160 --> 1:10:21.940
 Well when you have a Carl Gustav beside your face like this and it shoots around, it gives

1:10:21.940 --> 1:10:23.460
 you a concussive blast.

1:10:23.460 --> 1:10:27.300
 Also there's new research being done, I'll find out exactly what it is, but there's new

1:10:27.300 --> 1:10:31.560
 research that's being done that shows that if you're an artillery gunner and you stand

1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:36.280
 within a certain range of that gun, you get the same amount of concussive blasts and there's

1:10:36.280 --> 1:10:37.280
 a range.

1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:43.800
 I had no idea but you feel it when it goes off, like it hurt, your whole body feels it.

1:10:43.800 --> 1:10:47.200
 Your mind is fascinating because it's like literally the opposite of mine.

1:10:47.200 --> 1:10:50.520
 One you're able to speak very quickly, very clearly, very sharply.

1:10:50.520 --> 1:10:51.520
 Sorry, sorry.

1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:52.520
 No, what?

1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:53.520
 I talk too fast and I'm pretty loud.

1:10:53.520 --> 1:10:54.520
 No that's perfect.

1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:55.520
 Because of my hearing.

1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:56.520
 I admire, I mean I admire that very much.

1:10:56.520 --> 1:11:01.840
 I can't do any of that and you listen extremely well and you're extremely attentive and you

1:11:01.840 --> 1:11:02.840
 have a good memory.

1:11:02.840 --> 1:11:09.240
 Anyway, it's just fun to watch you and I can tell you're a great soldier in just all different

1:11:09.240 --> 1:11:10.240
 aspects of it.

1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:12.120
 Thank you, I appreciate it.

1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:13.480
 But what the heck we're talking about?

1:11:13.480 --> 1:11:14.980
 Oh, build up to the deployment.

1:11:14.980 --> 1:11:16.440
 How did we get to Texas?

1:11:16.440 --> 1:11:18.320
 Because that was part of the build up to my deployment.

1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:20.840
 And live fire you got to, did that feel good?

1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:21.840
 Oh yeah.

1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:26.440
 It was so good.

1:11:26.440 --> 1:11:32.280
 What's the favorite, what's the best part about like shooting artillery?

1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:35.360
 Like what's the thing that feels good?

1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:36.360
 Which part?

1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:37.360
 Power.

1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:38.700
 Well the feeling of power.

1:11:38.700 --> 1:11:43.660
 When is the best moment of, the highest moment of the feeling of power?

1:11:43.660 --> 1:11:48.640
 Is it the whole process that you love or is there like when you actually shoot it?

1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:49.640
 It's symbiotic.

1:11:49.640 --> 1:11:50.880
 It's a beautiful thing to watch.

1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:56.520
 To know that a gun can fire and it takes kind of a dance to make it work.

1:11:56.520 --> 1:11:59.940
 There's something about that to me that just got my heart racing.

1:11:59.940 --> 1:12:06.280
 When you actually shoot the round and you see it go and you hear it, it's unlike, you

1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:07.280
 can't describe.

1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:09.840
 There's no, I've never felt another feeling.

1:12:09.840 --> 1:12:14.820
 I've also never been in like an F18 or an F like 16 or like any, I've never been in

1:12:14.820 --> 1:12:16.440
 anything like that.

1:12:16.440 --> 1:12:20.520
 And I've, you know, I've never, trying to think of something else that'd be comparable.

1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:22.440
 I've never been in like a Formula One car.

1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:29.200
 Those are the only things I can picture being that much for me because to shoot one of those

1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:34.540
 and to know that you've done your job right means that you've helped.

1:12:34.540 --> 1:12:37.800
 And that to me was really what did it for me.

1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:43.680
 When you hear your sergeant say, mission accomplished, target hit, tired acquired, then you're like,

1:12:43.680 --> 1:12:47.000
 that's a good feeling, that's the stuff.

1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:48.040
 Quick pause.

1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:49.800
 Take a break Lex.

1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:54.280
 Okay, so live fire in Texas, we're in Texas by the way.

1:12:54.280 --> 1:12:56.520
 Fort Worth or Fort Hood, one of them.

1:12:56.520 --> 1:13:00.000
 Well, okay, so like it's what, is that close to a big major city?

1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.000
 Do you remember visiting a city?

1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:07.360
 Oh God, no, we fly right into the tarmac and they're like, don't touch the snakes.

1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:09.920
 And then they send you out to the field.

1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:10.920
 Got it.

1:13:10.920 --> 1:13:11.920
 Let's see the instructions.

1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:15.360
 No, really, we went into a classroom and they're like, these are the animals that are in the

1:13:15.360 --> 1:13:16.800
 wildlife in Texas.

1:13:16.800 --> 1:13:18.740
 If you see any of them, do not approach.

1:13:18.740 --> 1:13:19.940
 Do not go pee outside.

1:13:19.940 --> 1:13:20.940
 Do not squat down.

1:13:20.940 --> 1:13:22.200
 It is snake season people.

1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:25.820
 And I was like, I have to pee and squat down.

1:13:25.820 --> 1:13:31.000
 Why Texas and from like Canada, is it a simulation of Afghanistan?

1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:32.000
 Yes.

1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:37.040
 Okay, so that's, okay, so you're getting, and that's the way the live fire was seen

1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:41.840
 in artilleries, like you're trying to simulate certain aspects of what you might actually

1:13:41.840 --> 1:13:42.960
 see in Afghanistan.

1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:43.960
 I would think so.

1:13:43.960 --> 1:13:50.400
 I mean, we, it, it looks like it's hot, like it, you're out in the middle of nowhere.

1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:51.860
 Very similar terrain.

1:13:51.860 --> 1:13:56.360
 That's the first time we started to get to wear our tan boots and our tan, like our combat

1:13:56.360 --> 1:13:58.400
 tan stuff before you couldn't wear that.

1:13:58.400 --> 1:14:01.840
 So it gave us an opportunity to kind of break in, break in how we were going to be doing

1:14:01.840 --> 1:14:05.040
 this, what it was going to look like, how the guns were going to work and all of those

1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:06.040
 lovely things.

1:14:06.040 --> 1:14:10.240
 How do you go from there to being deployed?

1:14:10.240 --> 1:14:12.280
 What was the next part of the journey?

1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:17.480
 So then we go to Wainwright, Alberta, often called or referenced as Waincock because it

1:14:17.480 --> 1:14:19.720
 sucks so bad.

1:14:19.720 --> 1:14:25.560
 It is a massive open space in Alberta, which most of Alberta is, and it's outside of a

1:14:25.560 --> 1:14:27.320
 small town called Wainwright.

1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:32.800
 And it is a field X training area for all of the Canadian military.

1:14:32.800 --> 1:14:38.120
 And it's where you do live fire, but you also do workup training.

1:14:38.120 --> 1:14:40.480
 So you go out there for a month or two, I think it is.

1:14:40.480 --> 1:14:44.080
 I don't remember the exact time we were there because it was just, you sleep in a tent,

1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:47.940
 you're in your cot, you're in like full mission mode.

1:14:47.940 --> 1:14:53.940
 And you go outside and we did this operation called Operation Maple Leaf, I think it was.

1:14:53.940 --> 1:15:01.040
 And you put on these little suits, they have haptic, you can feel when you're shot.

1:15:01.040 --> 1:15:05.900
 And then there's a little camera, sorry, screen in the front of it, and it's got button options.

1:15:05.900 --> 1:15:09.580
 And so it's to mimic if you get shot, it'll say gunshot wound.

1:15:09.580 --> 1:15:12.420
 And then you have to choose, okay, do I do this or do I do this?

1:15:12.420 --> 1:15:15.540
 And depending on your response, person dies or lives.

1:15:15.540 --> 1:15:19.860
 And they have other people who aren't on a rotation for deployment come and act as the

1:15:19.860 --> 1:15:25.980
 Taliban and attack you in the middle of the night.

1:15:25.980 --> 1:15:30.580
 Is there a good understanding of the tactics that the Taliban used to attack?

1:15:30.580 --> 1:15:38.580
 I mean, this may be fast forwards to our conversation a little bit, but is there predictable strategies

1:15:38.580 --> 1:15:42.360
 on the other side that are being used in Afghanistan?

1:15:42.360 --> 1:15:43.360
 By the Taliban?

1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:44.360
 By the Taliban.

1:15:44.360 --> 1:15:45.360
 Oh, 100%.

1:15:45.360 --> 1:15:50.740
 They had suicide bombers, vehicle born IEDs.

1:15:50.740 --> 1:15:57.220
 Their standard way to hit people really was IEDs and vehicle born IEDs, suicide bombers.

1:15:57.220 --> 1:16:03.020
 They'd put like backpacks full of an IED and then put like toys around it and then just

1:16:03.020 --> 1:16:04.020
 be like.

1:16:04.020 --> 1:16:07.300
 So they will conceal it certain ways and probably use civilians.

1:16:07.300 --> 1:16:08.300
 Oh, 100%.

1:16:08.300 --> 1:16:09.300
 Yeah.

1:16:09.300 --> 1:16:13.300
 And women were a great way to get close to the soldiers because women seem nonthreatening.

1:16:13.300 --> 1:16:16.940
 When you see a burqa walk up to you, you're not expecting an AK 47 to roll out of that

1:16:16.940 --> 1:16:21.260
 and then, or, you know, but there are great ways to get close.

1:16:21.260 --> 1:16:22.260
 Okay.

1:16:22.260 --> 1:16:24.380
 So what is it, Wayne something?

1:16:24.380 --> 1:16:25.380
 Waynecock?

1:16:25.380 --> 1:16:28.100
 No, that's not how, Wayne Wright.

1:16:28.100 --> 1:16:29.100
 Let's go to Alberta.

1:16:29.100 --> 1:16:30.100
 Okay.

1:16:30.100 --> 1:16:31.100
 Okay.

1:16:31.100 --> 1:16:32.100
 I mean, we don't have to go to Alberta.

1:16:32.100 --> 1:16:33.100
 Nobody wants to.

1:16:33.100 --> 1:16:37.100
 No, let's, in our minds, in our imagination.

1:16:37.100 --> 1:16:38.100
 So okay.

1:16:38.100 --> 1:16:40.140
 So that's getting you closer to Afghanistan.

1:16:40.140 --> 1:16:41.140
 Right.

1:16:41.140 --> 1:16:42.140
 What was that like?

1:16:42.140 --> 1:16:44.020
 I mean, are you getting anxious at this point?

1:16:44.020 --> 1:16:45.020
 Is there a buildup?

1:16:45.020 --> 1:16:46.020
 What are you thinking?

1:16:46.020 --> 1:16:47.900
 Or is this just all part of the training?

1:16:47.900 --> 1:16:49.780
 For me, it was more part of the training.

1:16:49.780 --> 1:16:54.660
 I was excited to go because I did know that we were going to do some live fire.

1:16:54.660 --> 1:17:00.300
 I did know that we were going to be doing more of the military type job I thought we

1:17:00.300 --> 1:17:03.860
 were going to be doing because up until that point, I had just done training.

1:17:03.860 --> 1:17:07.220
 So I was learning how to march and salute and who to salute and not salute.

1:17:07.220 --> 1:17:10.580
 Like that was the focus of, that was my experience of the military.

1:17:10.580 --> 1:17:14.820
 And then the next experience was sitting in a regiment, just working out a lot and going

1:17:14.820 --> 1:17:16.340
 for breakfast a lot and drinking.

1:17:16.340 --> 1:17:18.740
 Like that was, I was like, this is the army.

1:17:18.740 --> 1:17:23.700
 So when I actually got to go to Wainwright, I got my first full taste of, okay, well,

1:17:23.700 --> 1:17:24.700
 there's fire picket duty.

1:17:24.700 --> 1:17:28.500
 So one person gets picked every night to do sentry.

1:17:28.500 --> 1:17:30.180
 There's a little less sleep.

1:17:30.180 --> 1:17:32.580
 You're eating out of a canteen now.

1:17:32.580 --> 1:17:33.580
 You're drinking out of canteen.

1:17:33.580 --> 1:17:34.580
 You're in your kit more.

1:17:34.580 --> 1:17:35.660
 You're in your deployable kit.

1:17:35.660 --> 1:17:40.220
 Now you're in your, you know, you're wearing your tack vest.

1:17:40.220 --> 1:17:42.220
 You're getting ready to practice having plates on.

1:17:42.220 --> 1:17:44.320
 You're having ammunition on you.

1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:45.980
 You've got your weapon with you all the time.

1:17:45.980 --> 1:17:51.540
 When you're on base in Quebec, you're, you're just like an everyday job.

1:17:51.540 --> 1:17:54.120
 Maybe you can paint a clearer picture to me.

1:17:54.120 --> 1:17:56.540
 When was there an understanding that you're actually getting deployed?

1:17:56.540 --> 1:18:00.740
 Was it just a sense that you're getting deployed or was this officially told to you?

1:18:00.740 --> 1:18:04.460
 I was officially told on graduation day, you're deploying in April with Vac Hits.

1:18:04.460 --> 1:18:05.460
 Oh, okay.

1:18:05.460 --> 1:18:06.460
 There's a date.

1:18:06.460 --> 1:18:12.060
 Like they, they knew, so what had happened is the reason that Vac Hits unit needed more

1:18:12.060 --> 1:18:13.060
 people.

1:18:13.060 --> 1:18:14.620
 So they came to that and they picked five people.

1:18:14.620 --> 1:18:16.820
 There was five English speaking people that went to Vac Hits.

1:18:16.820 --> 1:18:18.000
 It wasn't just myself.

1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:21.320
 There was a couple other people I knew that were English speaking that got put on other

1:18:21.320 --> 1:18:23.300
 guns within the regiment.

1:18:23.300 --> 1:18:24.860
 I wasn't with any of them.

1:18:24.860 --> 1:18:26.940
 We all kind of got split up.

1:18:26.940 --> 1:18:33.700
 And so there was an understanding that we were going to always be deploying.

1:18:33.700 --> 1:18:36.100
 Next year, it was like 2009, you're deploying.

1:18:36.100 --> 1:18:41.300
 Whether you left in May or April, we were deploying because that was the rotation time.

1:18:41.300 --> 1:18:44.420
 So each Canadian unit did between six and nine months.

1:18:44.420 --> 1:18:49.340
 And then you knew right around that point, another base of individuals would then deploy.

1:18:49.340 --> 1:18:51.300
 So you would go on these rotations.

1:18:51.300 --> 1:18:56.560
 And so even when I was on my deployment then, I was slated to go again the following year,

1:18:56.560 --> 1:18:58.280
 but towards the end of the year.

1:18:58.280 --> 1:19:00.000
 So there was always a rotation.

1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:03.500
 If you were in a combat arms unit and you were in one that was a deployable unit.

1:19:03.500 --> 1:19:09.620
 So if you were from Edmonton, a PPCLI, which were the Princess Patricia's, which were their

1:19:09.620 --> 1:19:10.880
 infantry unit.

1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:16.360
 If you were RCR out of Petawawa, Ontario, you knew you were deploying.

1:19:16.360 --> 1:19:19.020
 If you were at Vac Hits, you knew you were deploying.

1:19:19.020 --> 1:19:22.000
 There's combat arms bases, and then there's like naval bases.

1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:23.500
 I didn't know their deployment structure.

1:19:23.500 --> 1:19:25.220
 I didn't know how they worked.

1:19:25.220 --> 1:19:26.220
 I'm on the ground.

1:19:26.220 --> 1:19:27.420
 Don't worry about the boats.

1:19:27.420 --> 1:19:29.260
 So I didn't know how the Air Force deployed.

1:19:29.260 --> 1:19:32.240
 I knew Vac Hits was deploying in April.

1:19:32.240 --> 1:19:36.040
 You were going, get ready.

1:19:36.040 --> 1:19:37.040
 That was that.

1:19:37.040 --> 1:19:39.040
 So you show up to Afghanistan.

1:19:39.040 --> 1:19:43.300
 What is a combat arms unit look like?

1:19:43.300 --> 1:19:45.180
 What's the situation look like?

1:19:45.180 --> 1:19:47.620
 How much chaos is there?

1:19:47.620 --> 1:19:50.420
 How much clarity about mission is there?

1:19:50.420 --> 1:19:52.300
 What are your feelings about the whole thing?

1:19:52.300 --> 1:19:57.620
 So when you leave, the day you leave, we left Quebec, we got driven to the airport and then

1:19:57.620 --> 1:20:01.740
 we walked onto the tarmac and we load our own bags and we got on a plane and it's just

1:20:01.740 --> 1:20:02.740
 empty.

1:20:02.740 --> 1:20:04.300
 It's just, it's our plane.

1:20:04.300 --> 1:20:06.180
 And you don't go right to Afghanistan.

1:20:06.180 --> 1:20:10.420
 You go to a stopover point, which I don't know if I'm allowed to say where that is frankly.

1:20:10.420 --> 1:20:12.960
 So I just say it's somewhere overseas.

1:20:12.960 --> 1:20:16.860
 And you go there and you go there for a couple of days, I think it's like a day or two.

1:20:16.860 --> 1:20:18.720
 And that's where you get like your kit.

1:20:18.720 --> 1:20:21.340
 That's where you get your bulletproof plates for the first time and realize how heavy those

1:20:21.340 --> 1:20:22.340
 fucking things are.

1:20:22.340 --> 1:20:26.540
 It's where you get your weapon and your ammunition, your first few mags.

1:20:26.540 --> 1:20:31.300
 It's where you get your helmet and your vests and you get everything that you need.

1:20:31.300 --> 1:20:34.140
 While you're there, it's pretty nonchalant.

1:20:34.140 --> 1:20:35.140
 It's hot as hell.

1:20:35.140 --> 1:20:36.980
 It's your first time being in that kind of heat.

1:20:36.980 --> 1:20:38.860
 So you just never stop sweating.

1:20:38.860 --> 1:20:42.220
 The place we were in, it's just the second you got out of the shower, you were still

1:20:42.220 --> 1:20:43.420
 wet after you got out.

1:20:43.420 --> 1:20:44.580
 What the hell is happening?

1:20:44.580 --> 1:20:46.100
 It's so humid.

1:20:46.100 --> 1:20:47.580
 And I'm like, is this going to be like this in Afghanistan?

1:20:47.580 --> 1:20:49.300
 They're like, no, it's not humid there at all.

1:20:49.300 --> 1:20:51.260
 I'm like, why is it so bad here?

1:20:51.260 --> 1:20:52.620
 They're like, it'll be fine.

1:20:52.620 --> 1:20:53.940
 Don't worry about it.

1:20:53.940 --> 1:20:58.540
 So and where we were there, it was kind of cute.

1:20:58.540 --> 1:21:04.460
 We were like in a base, within a base and they had like turf and we had like ice cream

1:21:04.460 --> 1:21:09.660
 and fruit and you could go get on a computer, you could go make calls, you had showers,

1:21:09.660 --> 1:21:10.940
 you had a real bed.

1:21:10.940 --> 1:21:14.540
 It was very kind of okay for that point.

1:21:14.540 --> 1:21:17.380
 And then you got all your stuff and then okay, we're rolling out, which is about a five hour

1:21:17.380 --> 1:21:18.380
 flight.

1:21:18.380 --> 1:21:23.380
 Again, my experience with helicopters is mostly from another Arnold Schwarzenegger movie,

1:21:23.380 --> 1:21:24.380
 The Predator.

1:21:24.380 --> 1:21:29.620
 I'm not, do you want me to say I've never seen it?

1:21:29.620 --> 1:21:30.620
 I've never seen it.

1:21:30.620 --> 1:21:31.620
 Lex, do you feel better about yourself?

1:21:31.620 --> 1:21:37.100
 No, you want to tell the audience the, all the excellent shows that you mentioned me

1:21:37.100 --> 1:21:40.060
 offline that you watch instead, instead of Platoon.

1:21:40.060 --> 1:21:41.060
 Listen.

1:21:41.060 --> 1:21:43.700
 Yeah, this, nine is Sex and the City.

1:21:43.700 --> 1:21:44.700
 Was that more important than Platoon?

1:21:44.700 --> 1:21:46.460
 Oh no, I've never seen that.

1:21:46.460 --> 1:21:47.460
 Don't, don't put me in that category.

1:21:47.460 --> 1:21:48.460
 Why?

1:21:48.460 --> 1:21:49.460
 Did you just put me in a box?

1:21:49.460 --> 1:21:50.460
 I did.

1:21:50.460 --> 1:21:51.460
 I watch like Homeland.

1:21:51.460 --> 1:21:55.020
 I watch, no, I watch like, I watch a lot of documentaries.

1:21:55.020 --> 1:22:00.420
 I watch, I like to watch real, real things more than, than, than just film.

1:22:00.420 --> 1:22:06.580
 I did a little bit of film stuff when I got back into Canada and I was like, once you're,

1:22:06.580 --> 1:22:09.420
 once you've seen how it's made, I'm like, I don't want to do that.

1:22:09.420 --> 1:22:10.420
 Yeah.

1:22:10.420 --> 1:22:11.700
 I mean, I'm the same way as superhero movies.

1:22:11.700 --> 1:22:17.340
 It doesn't, I want, I want, I want something closer to reality, but then movies like Platoon

1:22:17.340 --> 1:22:21.140
 reveal some deep aspect of reality without it.

1:22:21.140 --> 1:22:22.860
 I did Superman Man of Steel.

1:22:22.860 --> 1:22:25.900
 Wait, you, sorry, you, you were, what do you mean you did?

1:22:25.900 --> 1:22:31.180
 I was not a military expert, but I was a stunt expert, even though I didn't actually have

1:22:31.180 --> 1:22:32.220
 to do any stunts.

1:22:32.220 --> 1:22:34.740
 It's just because I had previous military experience and they were going to have me

1:22:34.740 --> 1:22:36.580
 as an extra as a military person.

1:22:36.580 --> 1:22:39.500
 But if you have previous experience, they have to make it as like a stunt role, like

1:22:39.500 --> 1:22:40.500
 so you get paid more.

1:22:40.500 --> 1:22:41.500
 Got it.

1:22:41.500 --> 1:22:45.580
 So I got to sit at a desk and I was in that, I was in that like, you'd see me like, whew,

1:22:45.580 --> 1:22:46.740
 for like two seconds.

1:22:46.740 --> 1:22:50.220
 So what you're saying is you were the mastermind behind that movie.

1:22:50.220 --> 1:22:51.860
 For the entire thing.

1:22:51.860 --> 1:22:52.860
 You're so accurate.

1:22:52.860 --> 1:22:53.860
 Okay.

1:22:53.860 --> 1:22:54.860
 Great.

1:22:54.860 --> 1:22:56.420
 Your representation of me is just fantastic.

1:22:56.420 --> 1:23:02.500
 The combat arms unit of Afghanistan, the ice cream machine.

1:23:02.500 --> 1:23:07.580
 What like when you actually get closer and closer to the mission, what, when does that

1:23:07.580 --> 1:23:08.580
 happen?

1:23:08.580 --> 1:23:12.220
 When I, you know, got to where we were before we were leaving to get on the plane, I don't

1:23:12.220 --> 1:23:15.540
 really, I don't think I realized what the hell I was doing.

1:23:15.540 --> 1:23:19.300
 Truthfully, like you're asking me all these, like, what did you feel, how did you, like

1:23:19.300 --> 1:23:24.620
 when I really think about it, if I sit there and really think about it, I was deploying.

1:23:24.620 --> 1:23:25.620
 I was aware.

1:23:25.620 --> 1:23:26.740
 I knew what I was going to do.

1:23:26.740 --> 1:23:32.740
 I knew my job, but once we actually stepped onto that Herc to leave, to get into the Afghan

1:23:32.740 --> 1:23:35.060
 airspace, I think that's when it hit me.

1:23:35.060 --> 1:23:38.260
 I think it smacked me in the face so hard.

1:23:38.260 --> 1:23:48.660
 And that's when the overwhelming just reality was that, oh fuck, oh, oh, oh.

1:23:48.660 --> 1:23:55.260
 When they said, make weapons ready, put the barrel to the ground, put your helmets on.

1:23:55.260 --> 1:23:58.140
 That's when they start flying tactically, which means they're going between the mountains.

1:23:58.140 --> 1:23:59.640
 That means we're going to land soon.

1:23:59.640 --> 1:24:04.500
 Which means if you're flying like this, it's because RPGs can hit you.

1:24:04.500 --> 1:24:08.820
 So that was my first moment of, oh, I could like just be shot down right now.

1:24:08.820 --> 1:24:11.660
 Like I, I couldn't, I didn't grasp it.

1:24:11.660 --> 1:24:13.620
 I was, how old was I?

1:24:13.620 --> 1:24:14.620
 19.

1:24:14.620 --> 1:24:15.620
 19.

1:24:15.620 --> 1:24:16.620
 Yeah.

1:24:16.620 --> 1:24:17.620
 Wow.

1:24:17.620 --> 1:24:18.620
 Okay.

1:24:18.620 --> 1:24:21.540
 So I'm trying to explain to you cause it's hard because I don't know that I actually

1:24:21.540 --> 1:24:26.140
 did grasp it until I was in the air getting ready to land in Kandahar.

1:24:26.140 --> 1:24:33.300
 When was the first time you heard bullets, enemy, enemy bullets or enemy explosions?

1:24:33.300 --> 1:24:37.540
 Well, when you're in Kandahar, when you're in Kandahar, when you're at CAF, there's a,

1:24:37.540 --> 1:24:39.660
 you're fairly insulated away from the main walls.

1:24:39.660 --> 1:24:43.900
 You would hear stuff go off or you would hear the rocket sirens would go off.

1:24:43.900 --> 1:24:48.340
 So you would hear the, and everyone just kind of got down on the ground and just waited

1:24:48.340 --> 1:24:49.340
 for the all clear.

1:24:49.340 --> 1:24:50.820
 And then we got back up.

1:24:50.820 --> 1:24:58.160
 I didn't hear any actual live fire until I got to the FOB.

1:24:58.160 --> 1:25:00.340
 It was more just a lot of noise.

1:25:00.340 --> 1:25:04.260
 You would hear a lot of helicopters, a lot of planes going in and out of the base.

1:25:04.260 --> 1:25:07.380
 So there was that sense you could feel the ground shake when they took off, but there

1:25:07.380 --> 1:25:10.300
 was that sense, you know, things were going around, things were happening.

1:25:10.300 --> 1:25:12.620
 You just weren't far enough.

1:25:12.620 --> 1:25:17.060
 You were not close enough to the edges of CAF to see it.

1:25:17.060 --> 1:25:19.180
 So what's the FOB?

1:25:19.180 --> 1:25:25.140
 FOB is a Forward Observation Base, which is a small little base out in the middle of wherever.

1:25:25.140 --> 1:25:28.260
 And that's, that's specific to artillery?

1:25:28.260 --> 1:25:29.260
 No.

1:25:29.260 --> 1:25:32.540
 That's in general, just an observation base from which combat.

1:25:32.540 --> 1:25:36.580
 For infantry to go in and out of, for armor to go in and out of, special ops go in and

1:25:36.580 --> 1:25:37.580
 out of them.

1:25:37.580 --> 1:25:38.660
 They fly, they'll stop there.

1:25:38.660 --> 1:25:41.140
 They'll pick people up or do whatever, then they'll go out.

1:25:41.140 --> 1:25:45.960
 So it's, a Forward Observation Base is used essentially to have eyes in that area without

1:25:45.960 --> 1:25:48.260
 having to be doing patrols every five seconds.

1:25:48.260 --> 1:25:50.500
 But there's not, is it like, is there like medics there?

1:25:50.500 --> 1:25:51.500
 Oh yeah.

1:25:51.500 --> 1:25:52.500
 Yeah.

1:25:52.500 --> 1:25:53.500
 Yeah.

1:25:53.500 --> 1:25:54.500
 So it was.

1:25:54.500 --> 1:25:55.500
 Actual base?

1:25:55.500 --> 1:25:56.500
 Yeah.

1:25:56.500 --> 1:25:57.500
 I was, it's a, I don't call it an actual base.

1:25:57.500 --> 1:25:58.500
 You sleep in tents and cots.

1:25:58.500 --> 1:26:03.100
 And it is, the walls are this mesh material that are filled with gravel.

1:26:03.100 --> 1:26:05.500
 And that's the walls.

1:26:05.500 --> 1:26:06.500
 And then you have towers.

1:26:06.500 --> 1:26:10.860
 You had five, I think we had five towers because the Americans ran four and we ran one.

1:26:10.860 --> 1:26:12.380
 And so it was an American FOB.

1:26:12.380 --> 1:26:14.780
 It's called FOB Ramrod.

1:26:14.780 --> 1:26:17.780
 And there was a, were there Marines?

1:26:17.780 --> 1:26:20.380
 No, I think they were the 101st.

1:26:20.380 --> 1:26:22.020
 They were out of there.

1:26:22.020 --> 1:26:24.620
 This is where I get dicey because I was moved a lot.

1:26:24.620 --> 1:26:25.980
 So when people are like, who are you with?

1:26:25.980 --> 1:26:28.820
 I'm like, I know what their patches looked like.

1:26:28.820 --> 1:26:30.940
 I don't know the full ins and outs.

1:26:30.940 --> 1:26:34.140
 So I'm working on getting that back so that I can tell it accurately because I believe

1:26:34.140 --> 1:26:35.820
 it deserves that type of respect.

1:26:35.820 --> 1:26:40.020
 But that being said, I'm still trying to wrap my brain around all of this.

1:26:40.020 --> 1:26:41.020
 Yeah.

1:26:41.020 --> 1:26:46.740
 You almost have to go back and do like research to understand the full details of all the

1:26:46.740 --> 1:26:47.980
 things you were experiencing.

1:26:47.980 --> 1:26:50.860
 And so I reached out to actually a bunch of people even before I wrote the book and I

1:26:50.860 --> 1:26:51.860
 didn't get a lot of answers.

1:26:51.860 --> 1:26:55.380
 Well, once I did Jocko, all the people have reached out to me and were like, hey, and

1:26:55.380 --> 1:26:56.740
 I'm like, called you.

1:26:56.740 --> 1:27:00.420
 So now I'm working, that's why I'm doing the rewrite is I'm working on making sure that

1:27:00.420 --> 1:27:02.780
 things are exact.

1:27:02.780 --> 1:27:08.380
 And so there was infantry units going in at that FOB and it was a really tiny FOB.

1:27:08.380 --> 1:27:14.220
 It was run by the Americans and then there was a tiny little corner that was the Canadian

1:27:14.220 --> 1:27:15.980
 artillery unit.

1:27:15.980 --> 1:27:20.180
 And the Americans, normally it's Americans shooting for Americans, Canadians shooting

1:27:20.180 --> 1:27:21.180
 for Canadians.

1:27:21.180 --> 1:27:26.180
 The rest of the regiment that deployed, so Bravo and Charlie, they were at Canadian FOBs,

1:27:26.180 --> 1:27:29.280
 Massom Guard and another one and these were huge FOBs.

1:27:29.280 --> 1:27:35.980
 Ours was this tiny like three kilometer around place and we had this tiny little subsection

1:27:35.980 --> 1:27:40.340
 of it and the rest was so it was like this and then all American here.

1:27:40.340 --> 1:27:44.380
 And when we got there, we landed, the guns were already there.

1:27:44.380 --> 1:27:46.180
 So you ripped out the unit before you.

1:27:46.180 --> 1:27:49.380
 So those guys were just leaving and we were just replacing them.

1:27:49.380 --> 1:27:53.300
 So that we knew the guns, they were Canadian guns, we understood, you know, how to run

1:27:53.300 --> 1:27:54.300
 those.

1:27:54.300 --> 1:27:55.300
 That was fine.

1:27:55.300 --> 1:28:01.860
 When we got there, though, we had come in on Chinook and Chinooks are super loud and

1:28:01.860 --> 1:28:03.140
 they're like, we're hearing protection.

1:28:03.140 --> 1:28:07.100
 They don't, you're not, no, this is not reality.

1:28:07.100 --> 1:28:08.660
 Like this is why I'm partially deaf now.

1:28:08.660 --> 1:28:09.660
 Like it's not reality.

1:28:09.660 --> 1:28:15.920
 So sorry to take a tangent, but do you usually wear ear protection in any aspects of warfare

1:28:15.920 --> 1:28:17.500
 of this whole process?

1:28:17.500 --> 1:28:23.060
 You wear comms, like you have a comm on like in a radio if you're outside the wire.

1:28:23.060 --> 1:28:24.900
 So comms, is that like a Bluetooth headset?

1:28:24.900 --> 1:28:26.740
 Yes, it's a Bluetooth headset.

1:28:26.740 --> 1:28:27.740
 Okay.

1:28:27.740 --> 1:28:28.740
 No.

1:28:28.740 --> 1:28:29.740
 Like from Nike or like?

1:28:29.740 --> 1:28:30.740
 I was gonna say Adidas.

1:28:30.740 --> 1:28:31.740
 Okay.

1:28:31.740 --> 1:28:33.300
 I don't know if anyone was involved at some point.

1:28:33.300 --> 1:28:34.300
 I don't know.

1:28:34.300 --> 1:28:35.860
 This equipment looked like it was from World War II.

1:28:35.860 --> 1:28:39.060
 So it's comms, but is that having ear protection?

1:28:39.060 --> 1:28:40.060
 Like.

1:28:40.060 --> 1:28:41.060
 No.

1:28:41.060 --> 1:28:42.060
 No.

1:28:42.060 --> 1:28:43.060
 And I didn't wear them.

1:28:43.060 --> 1:28:44.060
 That's just what some people wore.

1:28:44.060 --> 1:28:46.860
 People when you were as low as me, like we weren't privy to conversate.

1:28:46.860 --> 1:28:48.980
 Like we were just told what to do and you do it.

1:28:48.980 --> 1:28:53.060
 So when you're doing like on the OP tower, you have a radio, you pick up and you call

1:28:53.060 --> 1:28:54.420
 in and then you put the radio down.

1:28:54.420 --> 1:28:59.560
 But for hearing protection, I mean, I would put in earplugs, but those things are so violently

1:28:59.560 --> 1:29:02.620
 loud that earplugs, they don't do it justice.

1:29:02.620 --> 1:29:09.540
 I feel like when you go shooting, there's a certain kinds of earplugs that you, it blocks

1:29:09.540 --> 1:29:14.420
 out the gut, like certain kinds of sounds associated with guns and you can still hear

1:29:14.420 --> 1:29:16.060
 other types of stuff.

1:29:16.060 --> 1:29:20.780
 So the ones they issued us were these big things that had like a headpiece like here,

1:29:20.780 --> 1:29:22.900
 but you have to wear your helmet when you're firing.

1:29:22.900 --> 1:29:23.900
 Right.

1:29:23.900 --> 1:29:25.380
 So you can't have both on.

1:29:25.380 --> 1:29:26.380
 Okay.

1:29:26.380 --> 1:29:29.260
 So how much are you aware of the logistics of the whole thing?

1:29:29.260 --> 1:29:31.900
 That's always fascinating with warfare.

1:29:31.900 --> 1:29:36.980
 Like in terms of setting up, you mentioned gravel and the fobs, like setting all those

1:29:36.980 --> 1:29:37.980
 bases out.

1:29:37.980 --> 1:29:41.980
 Were you seeing any of this or again, it's a 19 year old kind of just.

1:29:41.980 --> 1:29:43.580
 Well, it's not that I was oblivious.

1:29:43.580 --> 1:29:44.940
 That's the one thing I would say I wasn't.

1:29:44.940 --> 1:29:47.140
 I was, I'm very aware of my surroundings.

1:29:47.140 --> 1:29:50.460
 That's something that's always been taught to me from a very early age because I travel

1:29:50.460 --> 1:29:52.100
 a lot with my dad in the truck.

1:29:52.100 --> 1:29:54.660
 And so my dad would be like, you're going to go into that bathroom and I'm going to

1:29:54.660 --> 1:29:58.940
 watch you come out and you're going to watch everyone around you because people get kidnapped.

1:29:58.940 --> 1:30:00.460
 Like that's just the reality.

1:30:00.460 --> 1:30:03.280
 I was always very paranoid.

1:30:03.280 --> 1:30:07.020
 So you were paying attention to surroundings.

1:30:07.020 --> 1:30:09.620
 But the fob was already built up when we got there.

1:30:09.620 --> 1:30:12.100
 This is already like well established bases already.

1:30:12.100 --> 1:30:13.100
 Like there's.

1:30:13.100 --> 1:30:14.100
 Established enough.

1:30:14.100 --> 1:30:15.780
 All right.

1:30:15.780 --> 1:30:19.940
 And that is one of the first times you've heard actual fire.

1:30:19.940 --> 1:30:20.940
 Yeah.

1:30:20.940 --> 1:30:24.620
 That was like the, I mean, I'd heard it on the, when we, when we shoot and when we zero

1:30:24.620 --> 1:30:26.100
 in weapons and we do all that stuff.

1:30:26.100 --> 1:30:29.940
 But I had never heard it, heard it like that before.

1:30:29.940 --> 1:30:33.700
 And then you would see the, the, the guys, the Americans would roll out every day and

1:30:33.700 --> 1:30:36.020
 go on patrol and come back, back, back.

1:30:36.020 --> 1:30:40.020
 And so you would see them, you would hear them, they would tell the stories, those types

1:30:40.020 --> 1:30:41.060
 of things.

1:30:41.060 --> 1:30:45.100
 But I never experienced it because we never, we never got attacked.

1:30:45.100 --> 1:30:46.420
 Like our base never got hit.

1:30:46.420 --> 1:30:48.700
 We were really lucky that way.

1:30:48.700 --> 1:30:51.700
 There were other ones around us that were getting hit, but we weren't, we weren't getting

1:30:51.700 --> 1:30:52.700
 hit.

1:30:52.700 --> 1:30:54.740
 We were very fortunate.

1:30:54.740 --> 1:30:56.300
 At least we didn't get hit when I was there.

1:30:56.300 --> 1:31:00.540
 I believe the entry got, there was an attempt.

1:31:00.540 --> 1:31:04.620
 There was an attempt at some point in a past, but I wasn't privy to that.

1:31:04.620 --> 1:31:08.160
 But we were in the OP tower, so we had to do our own security.

1:31:08.160 --> 1:31:12.020
 But because we were such a small subset of Canadians and we always had to have people

1:31:12.020 --> 1:31:14.740
 running the guns and ready to run the guns at all times.

1:31:14.740 --> 1:31:16.180
 We only had to man one tower.

1:31:16.180 --> 1:31:20.700
 So you would do four hour shifts with a fire team partner in the tower, depending on whatever,

1:31:20.700 --> 1:31:22.200
 but you would do it every day.

1:31:22.200 --> 1:31:26.980
 So I would look out into the rest of Afghanistan at that opportunity.

1:31:26.980 --> 1:31:28.300
 Otherwise it was just like your walls.

1:31:28.300 --> 1:31:29.700
 What did it look like?

1:31:29.700 --> 1:31:31.100
 Is it beautiful?

1:31:31.100 --> 1:31:33.020
 Just the full landscape?

1:31:33.020 --> 1:31:34.020
 Or is it?

1:31:34.020 --> 1:31:36.540
 Where I was, there was mountains in the distance.

1:31:36.540 --> 1:31:39.520
 It was just very sandy, very flat.

1:31:39.520 --> 1:31:41.900
 And there was a couple of small compounds on the outside.

1:31:41.900 --> 1:31:43.760
 It wasn't a lot to look at.

1:31:43.760 --> 1:31:47.140
 There was a long road that you knew that got hit all the time.

1:31:47.140 --> 1:31:49.900
 There wasn't a lot to look at.

1:31:49.900 --> 1:31:56.020
 Such a strange place to be the center of superpowers over the decades.

1:31:56.020 --> 1:31:58.860
 It really is.

1:31:58.860 --> 1:32:03.340
 And the fact that the populace, the civilians are almost completely clueless to the full

1:32:03.340 --> 1:32:07.980
 history of things in terms of globally, the geopolitics of it all.

1:32:07.980 --> 1:32:08.980
 Yeah.

1:32:08.980 --> 1:32:12.180
 Well, if you look at the location of it, right, on a map, it makes more sense.

1:32:12.180 --> 1:32:13.180
 Right.

1:32:13.180 --> 1:32:15.420
 You can wrap your brain around it.

1:32:15.420 --> 1:32:18.500
 But I met plenty of people who had never even seen a picture of themselves when I was in

1:32:18.500 --> 1:32:19.500
 that country.

1:32:19.500 --> 1:32:24.740
 I mean, how much more are they going to understand if they don't know what even exists outside?

1:32:24.740 --> 1:32:31.580
 You tell a small story of taking a picture of a girl and showing it to her, an Afghani

1:32:31.580 --> 1:32:32.580
 girl.

1:32:32.580 --> 1:32:33.580
 Yeah.

1:32:33.580 --> 1:32:38.180
 We were, I was with the British at that time, and we were on that operation that gets highlighted

1:32:38.180 --> 1:32:39.580
 quite a bit.

1:32:39.580 --> 1:32:42.740
 And we had stopped and the ICOM radios were pinging.

1:32:42.740 --> 1:32:49.980
 And ICOM radios are a radio that we have an interpreter on that the Taliban, basically

1:32:49.980 --> 1:32:51.420
 we can hear what they're saying.

1:32:51.420 --> 1:32:52.420
 It's their comms.

1:32:52.420 --> 1:32:53.420
 It's us tapped in.

1:32:53.420 --> 1:32:56.160
 When it's really clear, they're close.

1:32:56.160 --> 1:33:02.460
 When it's scatty and they're far enough away, normally they're not planning an attack, although

1:33:02.460 --> 1:33:04.140
 you never know, really.

1:33:04.140 --> 1:33:09.300
 And we were going door to door, kind of like what they're doing now.

1:33:09.300 --> 1:33:11.140
 And we were pulling people out of their houses.

1:33:11.140 --> 1:33:14.500
 And we knew there were, there was people in there that were active Taliban and we knew

1:33:14.500 --> 1:33:15.500
 the ICOMs were pinging.

1:33:15.500 --> 1:33:18.900
 When we got in there, they had hidden all the women and kids and locked them inside

1:33:18.900 --> 1:33:24.580
 the house because often nowadays women, the women, they would hide things on them that

1:33:24.580 --> 1:33:28.020
 they shouldn't have because no one would be ever there to search them because there isn't

1:33:28.020 --> 1:33:30.300
 a lot of women on the front lines.

1:33:30.300 --> 1:33:33.540
 But I got borrowed to go specifically search women and children.

1:33:33.540 --> 1:33:38.460
 So they had me and one of the little girls kind of snuck out and was kind of sitting

1:33:38.460 --> 1:33:43.620
 near me and I was eating something and I had these little candies, I think they're called

1:33:43.620 --> 1:33:44.620
 little sweeties.

1:33:44.620 --> 1:33:46.020
 The British have them in the ration packs.

1:33:46.020 --> 1:33:47.020
 I don't know.

1:33:47.020 --> 1:33:48.020
 They're good though.

1:33:48.020 --> 1:33:51.740
 And she saw me eating them and so I gave them to her and then her brother came over and

1:33:51.740 --> 1:33:53.900
 slapped her upside the head and took them from her.

1:33:53.900 --> 1:33:56.700
 So then I just went over and slapped him upside the head and just pointed my gun at her while

1:33:56.700 --> 1:34:01.060
 she ate them all because I was like, no, you can have these.

1:34:01.060 --> 1:34:03.900
 I'm going to stand here and make sure you do.

1:34:03.900 --> 1:34:06.740
 And I remember asking, can I take a picture with her?

1:34:06.740 --> 1:34:10.620
 I asked the trip, can you ask her, can I take a picture with her?

1:34:10.620 --> 1:34:14.420
 And she was very confused and when you look at the photo, you see her face, she's very

1:34:14.420 --> 1:34:15.420
 stunned.

1:34:15.420 --> 1:34:16.420
 She's very stunned.

1:34:16.420 --> 1:34:17.580
 And it wasn't my camera.

1:34:17.580 --> 1:34:18.580
 It was my officer's camera.

1:34:18.580 --> 1:34:22.260
 It was a hot pink, like fluorescent pink camera.

1:34:22.260 --> 1:34:27.400
 So I pulled this like a huge pink thing and I'm like, let's take a picture.

1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:30.340
 And so she stood there and took a picture, but then she grabbed the camera because I

1:34:30.340 --> 1:34:36.100
 flipped it and showed it to her and her eyes got huge and she grabbed it and she ran inside

1:34:36.100 --> 1:34:37.780
 and they're like, oh, that's gone forever.

1:34:37.780 --> 1:34:40.100
 Like that's, it's over for you.

1:34:40.100 --> 1:34:44.820
 And then she came out and she kind of snuck out and I went in and grabbed it and the mom

1:34:44.820 --> 1:34:50.340
 lifted up her burqa and was showing me that she like shaved her legs to be more Western.

1:34:50.340 --> 1:35:00.260
 And I was just, at that moment, I don't know that I could have realized how much that moment

1:35:00.260 --> 1:35:08.220
 affected me, how much that moment would affect me later on in my life until it's been later

1:35:08.220 --> 1:35:09.220
 on in my life.

1:35:09.220 --> 1:35:10.220
 Yeah.

1:35:10.220 --> 1:35:16.880
 There's little like glimmers like that in parts of the world that are basically you're

1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:21.820
 taking away everything from the populace, like freedoms and so on.

1:35:21.820 --> 1:35:29.620
 And when they, when you see that glimmer of humanity, like yeah, shaved legs or like using

1:35:29.620 --> 1:35:34.780
 technology for the first time, it's magic or like food being presented with certain

1:35:34.780 --> 1:35:36.700
 kinds of foods that you've never tried.

1:35:36.700 --> 1:35:45.220
 I mean, you want to see true, like joy of discovery is you bring basically the American

1:35:45.220 --> 1:35:49.060
 supermarket, anything from it to most parts of the world.

1:35:49.060 --> 1:35:55.340
 And they, I just, I mean, I remember even, I mean, we weren't like in poverty in Russia,

1:35:55.340 --> 1:35:58.420
 just poor, but just the supermarket was full of joy.

1:35:58.420 --> 1:36:02.960
 I thought I could just die happy in an American supermarket when I first saw it.

1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:04.820
 And how old were you when you came here?

1:36:04.820 --> 1:36:05.820
 13.

1:36:05.820 --> 1:36:06.820
 Did you speak English?

1:36:06.820 --> 1:36:07.820
 Yeah.

1:36:07.820 --> 1:36:11.420
 Not well, I thought I was, I never was good at languages.

1:36:11.420 --> 1:36:16.500
 So I, it was very much like why would I need to learn another language?

1:36:16.500 --> 1:36:17.500
 Okay.

1:36:17.500 --> 1:36:24.900
 It was that attitude is very like, doesn't, I don't, well, no, I think culturally in,

1:36:24.900 --> 1:36:30.420
 not only in America, but everywhere else in the world, it's constantly kind of seen, it's

1:36:30.420 --> 1:36:35.500
 a good thing to do to learn other languages, especially English, because it's like, that's

1:36:35.500 --> 1:36:37.620
 the language of the world.

1:36:37.620 --> 1:36:43.100
 And I just thought like, I don't need English to discover the beauty of the world.

1:36:43.100 --> 1:36:45.140
 Like this doesn't like, I enjoy life.

1:36:45.140 --> 1:36:46.340
 I enjoy soccer.

1:36:46.340 --> 1:36:52.220
 I enjoy, I don't remember what else I enjoyed in life, but math, like why do I need English

1:36:52.220 --> 1:36:53.220
 for this?

1:36:53.220 --> 1:36:57.860
 So that kind of attitude got me in a lot of trouble when I came here because I couldn't.

1:36:57.860 --> 1:36:59.300
 You were reluctant?

1:36:59.300 --> 1:37:00.300
 Yeah.

1:37:00.300 --> 1:37:01.300
 But also just couldn't speak well.

1:37:01.300 --> 1:37:05.820
 And when you move 13 years old, it's middle school, you get made fun of a lot.

1:37:05.820 --> 1:37:10.260
 You get bullied and all those kinds of things, which in retrospect is a very positive thing

1:37:10.260 --> 1:37:13.420
 because it makes you harder.

1:37:13.420 --> 1:37:16.220
 I thought being Russian would be like hard enough.

1:37:16.220 --> 1:37:18.660
 No, well, me, everyone is different.

1:37:18.660 --> 1:37:26.780
 I mean, the part of the Russian thing is kind of, I'm joking because if you know me, I admire

1:37:26.780 --> 1:37:27.780
 being hard.

1:37:27.780 --> 1:37:33.780
 I admire fighting and these kinds of things, these, what would you call them?

1:37:33.780 --> 1:37:37.060
 Struggle in all of its forms, martial arts, wrestling, all those kinds of things.

1:37:37.060 --> 1:37:39.980
 But I'm ultimately like, I'm so much about love.

1:37:39.980 --> 1:37:46.380
 Like I'm clearly sensitive to the world in some weird genetic way that it was important

1:37:46.380 --> 1:37:52.500
 for me to harden up when I came here and I was in love with people and everybody's being

1:37:52.500 --> 1:37:53.500
 mean to me.

1:37:53.500 --> 1:38:03.020
 And it's like, what, that, it's a little like slap, like, oh, okay, life is not often fair.

1:38:03.020 --> 1:38:07.660
 And then that's when for me personally, everybody has different journeys of hardship that are

1:38:07.660 --> 1:38:12.860
 much, much more difficult, like your story is much more difficult.

1:38:12.860 --> 1:38:15.480
 I started to read a lot.

1:38:15.480 --> 1:38:18.380
 Something happens, some kind of challenge where you start to think about the world,

1:38:18.380 --> 1:38:24.740
 start to think about yourself, that can ultimately create really interesting minds.

1:38:24.740 --> 1:38:25.980
 It can break some people.

1:38:25.980 --> 1:38:27.860
 It can create interesting minds.

1:38:27.860 --> 1:38:28.860
 And it's ultimately your choice.

1:38:28.860 --> 1:38:30.940
 But those people are weak and then they just need to be weeded out.

1:38:30.940 --> 1:38:34.260
 I thought we talked about this, you know, the strong will survive, the weak will die

1:38:34.260 --> 1:38:35.260
 off.

1:38:35.260 --> 1:38:36.260
 Yeah.

1:38:36.260 --> 1:38:38.620
 Now you're talking Russian to me.

1:38:38.620 --> 1:38:39.860
 I'm not speaking Russian.

1:38:39.860 --> 1:38:43.860
 I'm just giving solid life advice.

1:38:43.860 --> 1:38:46.780
 Just be harder and then everyone will be fine.

1:38:46.780 --> 1:38:47.780
 Yeah.

1:38:47.780 --> 1:38:50.340
 That's your inner David Goggins coming out real quick here.

1:38:50.340 --> 1:38:51.340
 Okay.

1:38:51.340 --> 1:38:52.340
 The fob.

1:38:52.340 --> 1:38:53.340
 Yeah.

1:38:53.340 --> 1:38:57.340
 And then I was just explaining to you that the way it is run, you're going to love this.

1:38:57.340 --> 1:39:01.860
 When we walked up to those tents for the first time, the people that were there before us

1:39:01.860 --> 1:39:05.100
 left us a noose.

1:39:05.100 --> 1:39:10.300
 I have a photo of it, like hanging from the tent, like at the front of the tent, like

1:39:10.300 --> 1:39:11.820
 welcome.

1:39:11.820 --> 1:39:17.500
 So you were also mentioning like the dark humor of it is a basically a funny joke.

1:39:17.500 --> 1:39:18.500
 Correct.

1:39:18.500 --> 1:39:19.500
 Yeah.

1:39:19.500 --> 1:39:20.500
 It was funny at first.

1:39:20.500 --> 1:39:21.500
 That's pretty funny.

1:39:21.500 --> 1:39:22.660
 It was funny during the time.

1:39:22.660 --> 1:39:26.620
 Now when I look back at it, I was like, come on.

1:39:26.620 --> 1:39:29.900
 I mean, I get it because they had already been there.

1:39:29.900 --> 1:39:34.500
 And like, so afterwards I can see how it's funny.

1:39:34.500 --> 1:39:38.940
 Now with like the suicide epidemic in the veteran community, now I'm like, oh, I don't

1:39:38.940 --> 1:39:39.940
 post that photo.

1:39:39.940 --> 1:39:40.940
 Really?

1:39:40.940 --> 1:39:41.940
 Yeah.

1:39:41.940 --> 1:39:45.540
 Doesn't that dark humor still somehow help even when you're considering suicide?

1:39:45.540 --> 1:39:46.540
 Doesn't it?

1:39:46.540 --> 1:39:47.540
 Some of it.

1:39:47.540 --> 1:39:48.540
 Somehow.

1:39:48.540 --> 1:39:49.540
 It makes it copable.

1:39:49.540 --> 1:39:50.540
 Somehow.

1:39:50.540 --> 1:39:51.540
 Yeah.

1:39:51.540 --> 1:39:52.540
 It's like you're not hiding it.

1:39:52.540 --> 1:39:59.980
 It's like humor is one of the ways to reveal the reality of abuse, of suffering.

1:39:59.980 --> 1:40:04.060
 If you look at, there's this photo that generates right around suicide prevention month, which

1:40:04.060 --> 1:40:05.900
 is September.

1:40:05.900 --> 1:40:10.140
 And it's always like a photo of like Robin Williams and Bourdain and all of these other

1:40:10.140 --> 1:40:15.540
 individuals who were comedians who all took their lives and they're all smiling.

1:40:15.540 --> 1:40:19.100
 And they're like, this is the face of depression.

1:40:19.100 --> 1:40:26.460
 There's a way our brains work where humor is a necessary part of survival, whether it's

1:40:26.460 --> 1:40:31.760
 used for joyous things or it's used for ways to cope through life.

1:40:31.760 --> 1:40:35.220
 For me in the military, humor was one of the things that helped get me through.

1:40:35.220 --> 1:40:43.540
 And it still does to this day, frankly, because humor, humor makes some of the horrific things

1:40:43.540 --> 1:40:47.100
 I say not seem so horrific.

1:40:47.100 --> 1:40:53.060
 And people can digest it rather than being like, you need to be locked up somewhere.

1:40:53.060 --> 1:40:54.060
 Yeah.

1:40:54.060 --> 1:41:01.620
 That's why, I mean, one of the aspects of Russian humor, there's a darkness to it because

1:41:01.620 --> 1:41:06.340
 through it reverberates all the millions of people who died.

1:41:06.340 --> 1:41:10.340
 And it seems like the only way to make sense of it is to joke about it.

1:41:10.340 --> 1:41:11.340
 I still love it.

1:41:11.340 --> 1:41:13.740
 Because if you don't, it'll break you.

1:41:13.740 --> 1:41:14.740
 Something like that.

1:41:14.740 --> 1:41:22.100
 Or also humor just seems to be the highest form of us humans and the human experience.

1:41:22.100 --> 1:41:28.600
 It just seems, it seems to somehow accumulate the full thing, the absurdity of it, the unfairness

1:41:28.600 --> 1:41:35.060
 of it, because like ultimately all the suffering is like, it's all just apes fighting for power

1:41:35.060 --> 1:41:40.020
 and love and somehow torturing each other in the process.

1:41:40.020 --> 1:41:42.700
 Hello podcast listener, Lex here.

1:41:42.700 --> 1:41:46.660
 Quick intermission to say that some of the names in the following story have been silenced

1:41:46.660 --> 1:41:49.940
 out to protect their privacy.

1:41:49.940 --> 1:42:01.540
 The story of, and witnessing, I think your first, somebody you met, somebody you saw,

1:42:01.540 --> 1:42:12.220
 somebody you began to be close with, his life, him dying, can you tell the story of him dying?

1:42:12.220 --> 1:42:13.220
 Sure.

1:42:13.220 --> 1:42:14.540
 That's no problem.

1:42:14.540 --> 1:42:20.940
 I will tell you that I am going to leave some of the names out of the people because they

1:42:20.940 --> 1:42:24.020
 have reached out and asked that I do such.

1:42:24.020 --> 1:42:28.360
 I've also been informed of other things I forgot that happened during the thing that

1:42:28.360 --> 1:42:30.140
 were way worse than I thought.

1:42:30.140 --> 1:42:34.660
 So I'll try to add those in because that's new information to me because my brain has

1:42:34.660 --> 1:42:35.660
 blocked it out.

1:42:35.660 --> 1:42:39.740
 But I've been told, which is good because it's better detail.

1:42:39.740 --> 1:42:47.020
 So we were doing a movement that morning and we were going from compound to compound.

1:42:47.020 --> 1:42:49.740
 I was never told what we were doing.

1:42:49.740 --> 1:42:51.180
 I knew what my job was.

1:42:51.180 --> 1:42:53.500
 I didn't know the operational overview.

1:42:53.500 --> 1:42:56.900
 I didn't know who we were looking for.

1:42:56.900 --> 1:42:58.060
 I wasn't there for that.

1:42:58.060 --> 1:43:03.320
 My job was specifically to look after the women and children and to provide support

1:43:03.320 --> 1:43:05.040
 if need be.

1:43:05.040 --> 1:43:11.460
 And when you have certain people, so i.e. the bomb dog handler and the bomb dog, and

1:43:11.460 --> 1:43:16.700
 then you have the medics and then you have a female searcher, there's only one of those

1:43:16.700 --> 1:43:20.020
 in each unit or if there's even one in each unit.

1:43:20.020 --> 1:43:26.160
 I got passed between units so that they could have access to me for both.

1:43:26.160 --> 1:43:30.480
 And we were kind of sitting and we were waiting for the all clear to move.

1:43:30.480 --> 1:43:37.740
 And at that time, the compound wall I was leaning up against, I had my back up against.

1:43:37.740 --> 1:43:42.180
 I wasn't facing the direct direction where it actually blew up.

1:43:42.180 --> 1:43:46.940
 I had my back to it and I had happened to turn and look to the left.

1:43:46.940 --> 1:43:52.080
 And on the right hand side across the road of where we were leaned up against was another

1:43:52.080 --> 1:43:59.740
 compound two stories high, people inside, a sniper on the roof and a spotter.

1:43:59.740 --> 1:44:07.660
 There was a handful of us on this wall and in front of me, there was a road.

1:44:07.660 --> 1:44:09.580
 The road went straight.

1:44:09.580 --> 1:44:10.580
 That compounds here.

1:44:10.580 --> 1:44:13.380
 There's another road here on the right hand side in front of it.

1:44:13.380 --> 1:44:17.660
 And then this road went along here and this was a wide open space.

1:44:17.660 --> 1:44:20.160
 Just a huge.

1:44:20.160 --> 1:44:21.220
 We hate those.

1:44:21.220 --> 1:44:23.800
 You hate those because it's too much space.

1:44:23.800 --> 1:44:24.800
 It's too easy.

1:44:24.800 --> 1:44:26.440
 It's like fish in a barrel.

1:44:26.440 --> 1:44:29.720
 You don't want to be in that field.

1:44:29.720 --> 1:44:32.820
 Because there's too much line of sight line of sight.

1:44:32.820 --> 1:44:33.820
 Could be IEDs.

1:44:33.820 --> 1:44:34.820
 It could be.

1:44:34.820 --> 1:44:35.820
 It could be.

1:44:35.820 --> 1:44:36.820
 It could be anything.

1:44:36.820 --> 1:44:45.900
 And so when I was leaning up against the wall, we had sent a couple of people ahead to go

1:44:45.900 --> 1:44:50.420
 and clear the road so that we could all go along it and then clear the gray pup off to

1:44:50.420 --> 1:44:52.460
 the left hand side.

1:44:52.460 --> 1:44:57.900
 We are doing that because they use those locations to put IEDs so that when you're going to search

1:44:57.900 --> 1:45:03.140
 it, it's just it's a better chance of you blowing into a million pieces, essentially

1:45:03.140 --> 1:45:04.660
 why they love that.

1:45:04.660 --> 1:45:07.460
 Put bombs in small places, send people into small places.

1:45:07.460 --> 1:45:10.580
 Small places go boom, they paint the walls.

1:45:10.580 --> 1:45:13.580
 So we were just kind of sitting and waiting.

1:45:13.580 --> 1:45:17.880
 And then I turned, I happened to turn, I was looking in that direction and I heard the

1:45:17.880 --> 1:45:22.380
 ground shake before I even realized what I was seeing with my own eyes.

1:45:22.380 --> 1:45:33.100
 The ground shook and I saw a big piece of a body, I think it was the torso, just kind

1:45:33.100 --> 1:45:37.820
 of fly through the air and land into the field.

1:45:37.820 --> 1:45:40.860
 And as soon as that happened, all hell broke loose.

1:45:40.860 --> 1:45:44.960
 It was like the, they were sitting and watching and waiting and they do that.

1:45:44.960 --> 1:45:47.020
 And I say they, I mean the Taliban, they do that.

1:45:47.020 --> 1:45:51.020
 They love that because then they can record it for propaganda and they can use it against

1:45:51.020 --> 1:45:55.220
 us and they just love being able to take our people out.

1:45:55.220 --> 1:45:59.900
 And we had the interpreter sitting beside me and he had the ICOM radio on.

1:45:59.900 --> 1:46:06.960
 And as soon as the blast went off, I heard just the scream of, I heard it.

1:46:06.960 --> 1:46:13.900
 And I knew what that meant, but I couldn't, I didn't understand what was about to happen.

1:46:13.900 --> 1:46:20.740
 I couldn't, I couldn't wrap my brain around what was about to happen because I had never

1:46:20.740 --> 1:46:23.980
 been outside the wire.

1:46:23.980 --> 1:46:29.240
 And people are like, people say to me now, they're like, no, no, there's no way that

1:46:29.240 --> 1:46:30.240
 shit's true.

1:46:30.240 --> 1:46:33.260
 There's no way that she was involved in that and then that, and then in that, and then

1:46:33.260 --> 1:46:34.260
 in that.

1:46:34.260 --> 1:46:35.540
 Well, let me explain.

1:46:35.540 --> 1:46:37.740
 I was one person.

1:46:37.740 --> 1:46:42.240
 I was being passed around to units.

1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:46.100
 I was with a ton of different people.

1:46:46.100 --> 1:46:52.700
 I had no comms and I was just being told where to go.

1:46:52.700 --> 1:46:57.940
 And I just happened to be like a shit hit the fan magnet, it felt like.

1:46:57.940 --> 1:47:02.280
 And then I found out later it was not just me, it was all of us were getting it.

1:47:02.280 --> 1:47:05.860
 So that made me feel better because then I was like, well, I have a lot of survivor's

1:47:05.860 --> 1:47:06.860
 guilt.

1:47:06.860 --> 1:47:08.380
 That's like a thing that's still stuck with me.

1:47:08.380 --> 1:47:13.140
 I've worked through a lot of shit, but survivor's guilt, that's a big one for me.

1:47:13.140 --> 1:47:21.260
 And food is a big one for me and my food skin on food.

1:47:21.260 --> 1:47:28.460
 So like chicken with skin on it, just because of the biology of death, just when you hold

1:47:28.460 --> 1:47:33.820
 people's bodies in your hands with no gloves on, you know what that feels like when you

1:47:33.820 --> 1:47:37.220
 touch raw meat again, it's the same thing.

1:47:37.220 --> 1:47:40.340
 That's what that feels like when, when it's a dying or dead body.

1:47:40.340 --> 1:47:45.620
 Well, my friend was blown into a million pieces, so I just had pieces of him.

1:47:45.620 --> 1:47:54.420
 So there was no, there was no differentiator of like, this was his thigh, or this was his

1:47:54.420 --> 1:47:58.500
 torso, or there was like, there was none of that.

1:47:58.500 --> 1:48:07.540
 There's only one instance with the boot, but at that point we had been in some firefights,

1:48:07.540 --> 1:48:13.820
 and we had been taking some rounds, but it was more like take around, you know, get hit

1:48:13.820 --> 1:48:17.260
 and then we duck into a compound and we would set up and then we'd be firing.

1:48:17.260 --> 1:48:21.620
 I wasn't, I wasn't really involved in a lot of the firefights until after this.

1:48:21.620 --> 1:48:25.820
 After that, the rest of the week, I was like, I was angry and I wanted them all to go.

1:48:25.820 --> 1:48:28.600
 And I wanted to be in every position to take them out myself.

1:48:28.600 --> 1:48:30.660
 So I put myself in every position.

1:48:30.660 --> 1:48:31.940
 So I made sure I was on the roof.

1:48:31.940 --> 1:48:33.020
 I made sure I was there.

1:48:33.020 --> 1:48:35.100
 I made sure, Hey, you need something, I'll fucking run it.

1:48:35.100 --> 1:48:38.220
 I don't care if I die anymore, because as soon as that happened, my light switch went

1:48:38.220 --> 1:48:39.220
 off.

1:48:39.220 --> 1:48:40.940
 It didn't matter anymore to me.

1:48:40.940 --> 1:48:42.780
 Can you go through what happens?

1:48:42.780 --> 1:48:43.780
 Yeah.

1:48:43.780 --> 1:48:46.860
 So are you hearing the, these screams?

1:48:46.860 --> 1:48:47.860
 Yeah.

1:48:47.860 --> 1:48:54.540
 So the ID went off and what had happened was they put an ID inside of a grape hut and the

1:48:54.540 --> 1:48:58.600
 grape hut has rectangular wall, rectangular holes in the wall.

1:48:58.600 --> 1:49:03.260
 And there's just like one door and it's this tall mud hut with just all these like holes

1:49:03.260 --> 1:49:05.020
 in it.

1:49:05.020 --> 1:49:11.540
 And they had put an ID underneath a pile of sticks and had a metal detector, the Brits

1:49:11.540 --> 1:49:12.540
 carry them.

1:49:12.540 --> 1:49:15.980
 I've never seen, I think other countries have them, but I've only ever seen them use it.

1:49:15.980 --> 1:49:20.820
 And that's how we were kind of detecting if there was an ID, we must've hit it, the sticks

1:49:20.820 --> 1:49:22.700
 or something and it set it off.

1:49:22.700 --> 1:49:24.620
 And it just, it was over.

1:49:24.620 --> 1:49:25.620
 There's no way he felt anything.

1:49:25.620 --> 1:49:30.900
 And then there was another guy at the door bent down on one knee and he was facing and

1:49:30.900 --> 1:49:35.860
 kind of watching for, and then a blast hit him on this side.

1:49:35.860 --> 1:49:38.580
 And so it took him out and pulled his kid off, pulled his helmet off, pulled everything

1:49:38.580 --> 1:49:40.700
 off, fucked him all up.

1:49:40.700 --> 1:49:41.700
 Big time.

1:49:41.700 --> 1:49:43.460
 This is one ID.

1:49:43.460 --> 1:49:44.460
 Yeah.

1:49:44.460 --> 1:49:50.140
 But it was in a contained area and he was in the doorway, up and out.

1:49:50.140 --> 1:49:54.220
 Can you explain what an ID is and how does it work?

1:49:54.220 --> 1:49:55.660
 I can do my best.

1:49:55.660 --> 1:49:57.380
 They're improvised explosive devices.

1:49:57.380 --> 1:50:00.740
 They can be used pretty much out of anything to make anything.

1:50:00.740 --> 1:50:05.660
 So garbage, when we got to Afghanistan, they did the ID meeting with us.

1:50:05.660 --> 1:50:09.340
 They're like, these are what we're finding that they would show us diffused IDs.

1:50:09.340 --> 1:50:14.220
 So they would see those big blue drums filled with gasoline buried in the ground.

1:50:14.220 --> 1:50:16.980
 You would see a wire, it would go to a pressure plate.

1:50:16.980 --> 1:50:20.620
 You hit the pressure plate, that would hit that and it would go.

1:50:20.620 --> 1:50:21.620
 You would see IDs.

1:50:21.620 --> 1:50:24.380
 Some of them were ridiculous.

1:50:24.380 --> 1:50:29.660
 The engineering that went into some of these was hilarious because they were thinking,

1:50:29.660 --> 1:50:31.900
 they were thinking to use everything they could.

1:50:31.900 --> 1:50:34.680
 There was a cigarette pack they had used.

1:50:34.680 --> 1:50:38.580
 They lined the inside with tinfoil and when you stepped on the tinfoil, it had a piece

1:50:38.580 --> 1:50:42.540
 of wire and it was enough of a spark to set off a line of batteries that we had thrown

1:50:42.540 --> 1:50:43.820
 out that were all dead.

1:50:43.820 --> 1:50:47.220
 When you fuse them all together, there was enough juice to make it go.

1:50:47.220 --> 1:50:51.840
 Then they would attach that to like, like phosphorus or gasoline or whatever they could

1:50:51.840 --> 1:50:53.940
 that would make a big boom.

1:50:53.940 --> 1:50:57.860
 They would use, yeah, that's why you never kick garbage on the ground.

1:50:57.860 --> 1:50:59.940
 You'll never see me kick something on the ground.

1:50:59.940 --> 1:51:01.420
 You'll see me walk around it always.

1:51:01.420 --> 1:51:05.820
 If I ever see a pile of rocks or something that looks like it shouldn't be there, I won't

1:51:05.820 --> 1:51:07.180
 walk near it.

1:51:07.180 --> 1:51:12.140
 Even now, because they use that pile of rocks to remind people there's something there.

1:51:12.140 --> 1:51:14.700
 We don't know what that means, but we know that something's there.

1:51:14.700 --> 1:51:20.100
 And very often they would use anything, garbage, wires.

1:51:20.100 --> 1:51:24.220
 We were very, we had to burn everything for a reason.

1:51:24.220 --> 1:51:32.980
 It's so terrifying to not, for the source of death to be like little parts of the environment

1:51:32.980 --> 1:51:36.940
 and then people that don't look like that.

1:51:36.940 --> 1:51:42.660
 They're not dressed as soldiers, like civilians and like regular, because then you, when you

1:51:42.660 --> 1:51:48.660
 have to come back or even there is you're just surrounded by danger and then you distrust

1:51:48.660 --> 1:51:49.660
 everything essentially.

1:51:49.660 --> 1:51:54.740
 That's the problem and that's why you have such PTSD issues with the soldiers we have

1:51:54.740 --> 1:52:02.300
 now because you're in the environment in which it's very similar.

1:52:02.300 --> 1:52:03.740
 So there's this one IED.

1:52:03.740 --> 1:52:12.380
 So this one IED, I still don't know what it was, went off, body flew, the guy at the door,

1:52:12.380 --> 1:52:13.380
 he kicked out.

1:52:13.380 --> 1:52:19.500
 He was all broken and bleeding and a mess.

1:52:19.500 --> 1:52:21.700
 At that point, the radio started going crazy.

1:52:21.700 --> 1:52:25.580
 I could hear the guys yelling and screaming, trying to figure it out and then you could

1:52:25.580 --> 1:52:27.380
 hear the numbers being called.

1:52:27.380 --> 1:52:29.620
 KIA number, number, number, number.

1:52:29.620 --> 1:52:31.140
 I don't know anybody's service number.

1:52:31.140 --> 1:52:33.740
 I don't know what's going on.

1:52:33.740 --> 1:52:39.020
 Next thing you know, mortar rounds start coming down and live fire starts happening and I'm

1:52:39.020 --> 1:52:42.500
 like, holy fuck, things are popping off.

1:52:42.500 --> 1:52:46.580
 And I remember just looking at and being like, we need to go, we need to go now.

1:52:46.580 --> 1:52:52.020
 And I just got this like, I was like, we're going and they're like, hold on Burns and

1:52:52.020 --> 1:52:53.900
 I'm like, we're fucking going.

1:52:53.900 --> 1:52:58.460
 I wasn't dealing with it well and they're like, all right, all right, go, go, go, go.

1:52:58.460 --> 1:53:08.000
 So we went and I helped out with that other individual, kind of held him down, started

1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:13.820
 doing medic work on him and he just kept saying, where's, where's, where's, he was in such

1:53:13.820 --> 1:53:14.820
 a state of shock.

1:53:14.820 --> 1:53:16.620
 I've seen somebody's eyeballs so big in my life.

1:53:16.620 --> 1:53:21.540
 She's like, where's, where's, where's, he's good buddy, he's good, he's good.

1:53:21.540 --> 1:53:26.420
 Picture like a super thick Scottish accent though, because these guys were just, and

1:53:26.420 --> 1:53:29.140
 when they talk fast, it's even worse.

1:53:29.140 --> 1:53:33.300
 And then so I ran over and we jumped down into the ditch along the side of the road

1:53:33.300 --> 1:53:39.980
 because the road hadn't been cleared and we're running through these tall, they look like

1:53:39.980 --> 1:53:46.580
 cannabis plants, but they're not, but it just very thick bush and I felt like I was running

1:53:46.580 --> 1:53:47.580
 in slow motion.

1:53:47.580 --> 1:53:50.940
 So if you picture one of your video games where like the tunnel vision and you're just,

1:53:50.940 --> 1:53:56.220
 you can hear your breathing is like that and you're running and you can't move fast enough

1:53:56.220 --> 1:54:03.620
 and you're like trying to get there and we hit the road and the rounds are coming down

1:54:03.620 --> 1:54:06.740
 and mortars are coming down and they're like, okay, on three run.

1:54:06.740 --> 1:54:11.620
 So we run on three and we run into the compound, I mean, into the great putt.

1:54:11.620 --> 1:54:17.420
 And I remember looking around and very seriously going, where is he?

1:54:17.420 --> 1:54:23.760
 Just genuinely asking, I think it was been messaging me and he's been incredible.

1:54:23.760 --> 1:54:26.940
 He's one of the best soldiers I've ever served with.

1:54:26.940 --> 1:54:29.980
 He was a higher up, so he was running part of this.

1:54:29.980 --> 1:54:33.920
 He's messaged me and he was giving me some information and he's like, I was in there

1:54:33.920 --> 1:54:38.460
 with you and he goes, I remember cause you handed me the boot and cause I walked over

1:54:38.460 --> 1:54:42.860
 and I, all the rounds were like, we were being shot at, mortars were coming down, but it

1:54:42.860 --> 1:54:50.300
 was this slow motion and I remember walking over to the hole in the ground and seeing

1:54:50.300 --> 1:54:57.820
 his boot in the ground, but it was, his leg was still hanging, like just below his knee

1:54:57.820 --> 1:55:03.860
 was still in it, but the boot was perfectly laced up, like the boot was fine.

1:55:03.860 --> 1:55:09.220
 And I just, I held it and I turned and I looked at the guys and I was like, we could reuse

1:55:09.220 --> 1:55:13.500
 the boot.

1:55:13.500 --> 1:55:17.060
 Now that wasn't even, what is, what is that?

1:55:17.060 --> 1:55:25.460
 Was that, was that actually an intelligent attempt at humor or was it some kind of deeply

1:55:25.460 --> 1:55:26.460
 lost?

1:55:26.460 --> 1:55:27.740
 Like you were completely just lost.

1:55:27.740 --> 1:55:29.940
 I think my brain broke.

1:55:29.940 --> 1:55:35.180
 I think my, that's the moment I call my light switch went off.

1:55:35.180 --> 1:55:37.700
 Did you understand that he was dead at that point?

1:55:37.700 --> 1:55:45.180
 Like intellectually, you were just something, it just broke.

1:55:45.180 --> 1:55:46.180
 No emotion.

1:55:46.180 --> 1:55:47.180
 Like it just broke.

1:55:47.180 --> 1:55:48.180
 It just shattered.

1:55:48.180 --> 1:55:49.180
 It shattered.

1:55:49.180 --> 1:55:50.180
 I felt it happen.

1:55:50.180 --> 1:55:51.180
 Felt.

1:55:51.180 --> 1:56:06.020
 I didn't feel, I didn't feel anything.

1:56:06.020 --> 1:56:08.500
 It just broke.

1:56:08.500 --> 1:56:15.260
 And at that moment, because later there's some anger almost at that moment, none of

1:56:15.260 --> 1:56:16.260
 that.

1:56:16.260 --> 1:56:17.260
 I couldn't comprehend what happened.

1:56:17.260 --> 1:56:23.020
 I knew he wasn't there anymore because they looked at me and said, what's here is here.

1:56:23.020 --> 1:56:24.300
 Start grabbing pieces.

1:56:24.300 --> 1:56:26.420
 We need to fucking move.

1:56:26.420 --> 1:56:32.780
 And so I handed the boot over, they took it and then I started just grabbing anything

1:56:32.780 --> 1:56:38.680
 out of the walls because those little rectangular just had flesh hanging from it.

1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:42.820
 And I didn't have my gloves on because I only used them to search.

1:56:42.820 --> 1:56:48.780
 So you want to bring everything back.

1:56:48.780 --> 1:56:55.100
 This is what, even if they're dead, do you want to save, save those you served with?

1:56:55.100 --> 1:56:56.100
 Yeah.

1:56:56.100 --> 1:56:57.200
 Because they deserve that.

1:56:57.200 --> 1:57:00.380
 They don't deserve to have a piece of them drug behind a truck for propaganda.

1:57:00.380 --> 1:57:02.260
 It's not, it's not fair.

1:57:02.260 --> 1:57:03.260
 What are the others?

1:57:03.260 --> 1:57:07.260
 I mean, was there just a focus on mission or was there a panic?

1:57:07.260 --> 1:57:08.980
 No panic with these guys.

1:57:08.980 --> 1:57:12.540
 These guys were the most switched on motherfuckers I've ever seen in my life.

1:57:12.540 --> 1:57:19.600
 They, we started grabbing and remind me, he said, you know, you, uh, that's not, he goes,

1:57:19.600 --> 1:57:21.820
 when people say that's the worst part of your day, that wasn't even the worst part of your

1:57:21.820 --> 1:57:22.820
 day.

1:57:22.820 --> 1:57:27.780
 Do you remember when you handed me the bag of intestines?

1:57:27.780 --> 1:57:29.780
 No.

1:57:29.780 --> 1:57:34.700
 No, I do though.

1:57:34.700 --> 1:57:36.300
 Thank you for that.

1:57:36.300 --> 1:57:39.060
 So there's parts you don't even, they're just not.

1:57:39.060 --> 1:57:42.340
 They don't register.

1:57:42.340 --> 1:57:45.740
 Because I had some people contact me and be like, you didn't tell it right.

1:57:45.740 --> 1:57:51.660
 And war is subjective and war is from your perspective and war is messy and horrific

1:57:51.660 --> 1:58:03.360
 and war is graphic and violent and painful.

1:58:03.360 --> 1:58:07.300
 Your brain remembers what it wants to remember and your brain allows you to remember what

1:58:07.300 --> 1:58:12.660
 it allows you to remember and there's reasons that you don't remember everything.

1:58:12.660 --> 1:58:17.660
 And so we were getting, we were really getting hit.

1:58:17.660 --> 1:58:19.860
 We were getting, it was bad.

1:58:19.860 --> 1:58:25.420
 And some of the guys, machine gunners had come up to do cover fire and I know, uh, we

1:58:25.420 --> 1:58:32.420
 were calling in for air support to come pick up the guys, uh, because they had to go.

1:58:32.420 --> 1:58:39.020
 And we, we just collected everything we could, but I did remember screaming like, we didn't

1:58:39.020 --> 1:58:40.020
 get them all.

1:58:40.020 --> 1:58:41.020
 We didn't get them all.

1:58:41.020 --> 1:58:42.020
 There's no way we got them all.

1:58:42.020 --> 1:58:43.020
 We did not fucking get them all.

1:58:43.020 --> 1:58:45.020
 And I remember one of the guys looking at me being like, we got them, we got them.

1:58:45.020 --> 1:58:46.020
 I'm like, we didn't fucking get them.

1:58:46.020 --> 1:58:47.020
 We didn't get them.

1:58:47.020 --> 1:58:48.020
 Like, no, we got them.

1:58:48.020 --> 1:58:50.780
 And I couldn't say it enough.

1:58:50.780 --> 1:58:54.180
 And so I grabbed as much as I could.

1:58:54.180 --> 1:59:00.380
 I, I, I, um, I slung one of their weapons and it was just a twisted heap and I had his

1:59:00.380 --> 1:59:03.500
 helmet and someone else's helmet in my arm.

1:59:03.500 --> 1:59:10.020
 And then I had, um, my weapon in front of me and I was carrying it.

1:59:10.020 --> 1:59:13.740
 And then we, we piled everything we had onto a stretcher.

1:59:13.740 --> 1:59:16.700
 Those things are super fucking flimsy anyway.

1:59:16.700 --> 1:59:20.060
 And there was a couple of guys in front of us and there were a couple behind me and I

1:59:20.060 --> 1:59:24.500
 was kind of in the middle and we, we said, okay, we're just gonna have to run.

1:59:24.500 --> 1:59:25.500
 We're gonna have to fucking run the road.

1:59:25.500 --> 1:59:26.500
 We're gonna have to have to run it.

1:59:26.500 --> 1:59:27.500
 It was a chance.

1:59:27.500 --> 1:59:32.440
 We ran it and that was the closest, well, that was I guess not the closest, but it felt

1:59:32.440 --> 1:59:38.980
 like it was the closest I could hear the, the whiz of the rounds going by me.

1:59:38.980 --> 1:59:43.980
 It's a weird noise when they're coming at you than when you're, they're leaving you.

1:59:43.980 --> 1:59:47.860
 And so they, that slowed everything down for me.

1:59:47.860 --> 1:59:51.400
 And then one of the guys accidentally dropped the edge of the stretcher and everything fell

1:59:51.400 --> 1:59:56.380
 off into the ditch and then we had to go back down and get it back up.

1:59:56.380 --> 2:00:00.700
 And then so we kept running and we finally got back into the compound that that sniper

2:00:00.700 --> 2:00:05.260
 was sitting off on the right hand side and we got all in there.

2:00:05.260 --> 2:00:09.060
 And I know the, I think said there was two flights.

2:00:09.060 --> 2:00:12.700
 I only thought there was one, but apparently there was two flights.

2:00:12.700 --> 2:00:15.400
 So went on one, his body went on one.

2:00:15.400 --> 2:00:21.500
 And then I think, I think he said went on the other and and then they took off.

2:00:21.500 --> 2:00:25.700
 And then when they leave though, they rain hell down on anything they can see on the

2:00:25.700 --> 2:00:26.700
 ground.

2:00:26.700 --> 2:00:30.420
 And that is a beautiful sight because they had mortar rounds coming down and it just,

2:00:30.420 --> 2:00:33.100
 it was getting really, really bad.

2:00:33.100 --> 2:00:41.220
 And then as soon as the black ox took off, all of a sudden it just stopped and went quiet,

2:00:41.220 --> 2:00:44.820
 like deafening quiet.

2:00:44.820 --> 2:00:48.500
 And we were sitting inside the compound and I, one of the medics looked at me and you

2:00:48.500 --> 2:00:52.460
 could see, and I still do it now and I, I'm working on not doing it, but I do it when

2:00:52.460 --> 2:00:55.020
 I get really overwhelmed.

2:00:55.020 --> 2:01:00.020
 Because I didn't have any gloves on, I had blood all over my hands and just like body

2:01:00.020 --> 2:01:01.020
 and stuff.

2:01:01.020 --> 2:01:05.360
 So he came over and he just gave me like sanitizer and I started rubbing.

2:01:05.360 --> 2:01:11.180
 And so I rub, I do this when I'm stressed, I'll rub my hands.

2:01:11.180 --> 2:01:17.940
 And I still can't, I still can't do, I still can't eat food with skin on it.

2:01:17.940 --> 2:01:22.420
 And I can't like, like salmon and stuff, like I can't, anything with skin, I can't touch

2:01:22.420 --> 2:01:23.420
 it.

2:01:23.420 --> 2:01:28.540
 And I'm making meat at home, like for my husband and my son, like I have like meat gloves and

2:01:28.540 --> 2:01:31.420
 then I have like a fork and a knife and I'm like cutting it.

2:01:31.420 --> 2:01:34.700
 Like I never touch it, I can't touch it.

2:01:34.700 --> 2:01:43.540
 So there's something almost like the texture of the biology of a human flesh that just,

2:01:43.540 --> 2:01:47.220
 that's at the level of, that's the level of your trauma.

2:01:47.220 --> 2:01:48.220
 Yeah.

2:01:48.220 --> 2:01:51.420
 And it's been, I mean, it's 2021, this was in 09.

2:01:51.420 --> 2:01:57.180
 And I've worked on this, like, and I mean, I've been in like treatment religiously,

2:01:57.180 --> 2:02:00.440
 just to be able to keep me alive for this decade.

2:02:00.440 --> 2:02:04.060
 And so it's not like, it's like, oh, I've never, you never even tried to get better.

2:02:04.060 --> 2:02:06.420
 It's like, I never really used to leave my house.

2:02:06.420 --> 2:02:10.260
 I used to call people that looked like that horrific names in public.

2:02:10.260 --> 2:02:13.640
 I used to want to kill people on a regular basis.

2:02:13.640 --> 2:02:16.380
 I'm a fairly happy individual now.

2:02:16.380 --> 2:02:24.540
 What about, so you're, you're talking about sort of skin and parts and, but there's also

2:02:24.540 --> 2:02:31.180
 just the fact that we're mortal and there's somebody close to you who dies.

2:02:31.180 --> 2:02:34.380
 So you watch, walk up and then never come back out again?

2:02:34.380 --> 2:02:35.380
 Yeah.

2:02:35.380 --> 2:02:38.780
 It's like you're facing mortality in a very real way.

2:02:38.780 --> 2:02:44.820
 And if, in a, in a way that's not the same as somebody dying from cancer in a hospital,

2:02:44.820 --> 2:02:48.860
 so it has echoes of that because that's also absurd.

2:02:48.860 --> 2:02:55.220
 And like, it doesn't feel like there's justice to it in any kind of way, but it's so sudden.

2:02:55.220 --> 2:03:03.140
 Like, have you been able to make sense of that, of your feelings about it?

2:03:03.140 --> 2:03:11.380
 Like how do you feel about it or, or is everything just shrouded in this like trauma that you're

2:03:11.380 --> 2:03:19.740
 not able to just feel for the loss of a human being, like mourn the loss of a human being?

2:03:19.740 --> 2:03:28.540
 I think I had, when he, when I realized he wasn't there, when I realized that he, um,

2:03:28.540 --> 2:03:33.880
 that was the, I, that was what was left of him, I found out afterwards there was other

2:03:33.880 --> 2:03:37.740
 parts that were outside and went back.

2:03:37.740 --> 2:03:43.180
 I think, I think he said went back and they got, they ended up getting the rest of him.

2:03:43.180 --> 2:03:47.020
 So that made me happy because I just found this out this week.

2:03:47.020 --> 2:03:54.160
 Uh, so that, that means, so that means you have a feeling like you still feel like parts

2:03:54.160 --> 2:03:56.420
 of them were left behind.

2:03:56.420 --> 2:03:57.860
 Yeah.

2:03:57.860 --> 2:04:07.140
 On the ramp ceremony, when I lost my mind, literally I, I lost my mind and I was screaming

2:04:07.140 --> 2:04:10.220
 that he wasn't all in there.

2:04:10.220 --> 2:04:18.020
 I'm happy now knowing that he was, but I held onto that for 10 years.

2:04:18.020 --> 2:04:19.020
 Yeah.

2:04:19.020 --> 2:04:28.140
 This, um, yeah, the sandbags, like, like it's the bulk of the weight is, is not from human

2:04:28.140 --> 2:04:29.140
 flesh.

2:04:29.140 --> 2:04:30.140
 Yeah.

2:04:30.140 --> 2:04:32.140
 He was a young kid too.

2:04:32.140 --> 2:04:35.420
 It was, I think it was his first deployment as well.

2:04:35.420 --> 2:04:42.980
 Like he was, he was a young kid and he was just, just going to clear the road for the

2:04:42.980 --> 2:04:43.980
 rest of us.

2:04:43.980 --> 2:04:44.980
 Right.

2:04:44.980 --> 2:04:48.580
 Like not like, you know, you're in war and you know that you're outside the wire and

2:04:48.580 --> 2:04:50.820
 you know, things could happen.

2:04:50.820 --> 2:04:57.540
 You understand that to the extent you can understand that when it's happening, it's

2:04:57.540 --> 2:04:59.660
 something very different.

2:04:59.660 --> 2:05:07.180
 Also maybe you can correct me, but, um, there's something much more like brutal about an IED.

2:05:07.180 --> 2:05:09.020
 It's proficuous.

2:05:09.020 --> 2:05:15.860
 Versus like a bullet, cause a bullet, you still watching somebody close to you die from

2:05:15.860 --> 2:05:20.940
 a bullet, you still get to the basic humanity.

2:05:20.940 --> 2:05:26.980
 Like so IED basically converted a human being into sort of parts by biological parts.

2:05:26.980 --> 2:05:28.660
 A cheeseburger.

2:05:28.660 --> 2:05:35.540
 Versus, yeah, I mean, I don't, that's, that's tough.

2:05:35.540 --> 2:05:43.580
 That's tough because that's like, um, because it's hard for you to remember them as a human.

2:05:43.580 --> 2:05:45.940
 You remember them as parts.

2:05:45.940 --> 2:05:48.400
 For me, that's how I remember him.

2:05:48.400 --> 2:05:52.740
 I would like to, I have a picture that I post every year about him.

2:05:52.740 --> 2:06:00.660
 I see that, but I don't put two and two together.

2:06:00.660 --> 2:06:01.660
 Does that make sense?

2:06:01.660 --> 2:06:03.220
 Yeah, no, it does.

2:06:03.220 --> 2:06:08.120
 So I, even I listening to your story and, you know, um, thank you for sharing it first

2:06:08.120 --> 2:06:12.940
 of all, but, um, it's not my, it's, well, I'm just the one to tell it.

2:06:12.940 --> 2:06:19.420
 I was just involved one, one set of eyes on this particular human being.

2:06:19.420 --> 2:06:20.980
 But even I get angry.

2:06:20.980 --> 2:06:24.060
 I can't tell if it's exhaustion or anger.

2:06:24.060 --> 2:06:25.060
 I'm sorry.

2:06:25.060 --> 2:06:26.060
 I look always exhausted.

2:06:26.060 --> 2:06:27.060
 Oh, that's okay.

2:06:27.060 --> 2:06:28.060
 You're, you're into robotics.

2:06:28.060 --> 2:06:29.060
 Isn't that like your guys's thing?

2:06:29.060 --> 2:06:35.620
 You guys are just always working on, I think because I feel so much for the world.

2:06:35.620 --> 2:06:39.500
 I just don't do, we were talking about resting bitch face earlier.

2:06:39.500 --> 2:06:45.260
 I just don't feel the need to maintain, um, all the effort of the musculature for presenting

2:06:45.260 --> 2:06:46.820
 myself to you visually.

2:06:46.820 --> 2:06:47.820
 It's exhausting.

2:06:47.820 --> 2:06:48.820
 It's exhausting.

2:06:48.820 --> 2:06:49.820
 So I just focus on the feeling.

2:06:49.820 --> 2:06:50.820
 No way.

2:06:50.820 --> 2:06:52.500
 Face show, whatever the hell it shows.

2:06:52.500 --> 2:06:53.500
 Fair enough.

2:06:53.500 --> 2:06:54.500
 Okay.

2:06:54.500 --> 2:06:56.300
 Was there anger?

2:06:56.300 --> 2:06:57.300
 Was there hate?

2:06:57.300 --> 2:06:58.300
 Yeah.

2:06:58.300 --> 2:07:02.980
 Can you just talk to your feelings of what you remember?

2:07:02.980 --> 2:07:03.980
 Yeah.

2:07:03.980 --> 2:07:11.260
 So after that operation with the British, I went back to the Canadians and I didn't

2:07:11.260 --> 2:07:16.500
 go back as even remotely close to who I was when I left.

2:07:16.500 --> 2:07:22.140
 And that was really troublesome for a lot of people around me because the level of anger

2:07:22.140 --> 2:07:29.420
 and hate that came out of me was palpable when I just walked by, um, I got shockingly

2:07:29.420 --> 2:07:36.900
 quiet and you understand how you're learning how to be terrified if you are quiet.

2:07:36.900 --> 2:07:41.700
 And I don't know if hate and anger do that justice.

2:07:41.700 --> 2:07:47.780
 I don't know another word, but I don't think those two words do it justice to the extent

2:07:47.780 --> 2:07:54.740
 that I was feeling like I got to a point when I got attacked by a woman, um, with some scissors,

2:07:54.740 --> 2:07:59.060
 like the idea crossed my mind, like I could boot stomp her to death and not feel anything

2:07:59.060 --> 2:08:01.820
 about it in front of her, all of her family and her kids.

2:08:01.820 --> 2:08:06.860
 Was it more like just not recognizing the basic humanity or was it legit hatred?

2:08:06.860 --> 2:08:13.380
 No, it was legit hatred, but also I no longer saw those people as humans.

2:08:13.380 --> 2:08:14.700
 It took one event.

2:08:14.700 --> 2:08:20.980
 And when that happened, the rest of the operation that was echoed in my, in the way I was to

2:08:20.980 --> 2:08:21.980
 those people.

2:08:21.980 --> 2:08:26.980
 But to what level can you see those people as human?

2:08:26.980 --> 2:08:36.540
 So this is where, well, like this is where Jaco shut down, um, I still think I'm right.

2:08:36.540 --> 2:08:45.100
 Um, there's a dire straight song called, uh, brothers in arms and, um, actually anyway,

2:08:45.100 --> 2:08:48.620
 we're fools to make war on our brothers in arms.

2:08:48.620 --> 2:08:58.460
 And I brought that up to Jaco because it's humans on both sides, but he said, not in

2:08:58.460 --> 2:09:04.620
 Iraq like to him, he's like, no, that's the enemy.

2:09:04.620 --> 2:09:07.740
 These are people who use the civilians.

2:09:07.740 --> 2:09:12.300
 They rape, they torture, they they'll do anything.

2:09:12.300 --> 2:09:14.020
 And they put evil onto the world.

2:09:14.020 --> 2:09:18.220
 And then it's like, so they're, they're stood on at that moment.

2:09:18.220 --> 2:09:26.660
 Like the, these two were humans and it's politicians waging war and it's, it's kids on both sides.

2:09:26.660 --> 2:09:31.300
 But then Jaco was like, no, he's not wrong.

2:09:31.300 --> 2:09:36.260
 So which can you carry both things with you as a soldier?

2:09:36.260 --> 2:09:40.380
 I think when I was a soldier, I could only carry one thing with me.

2:09:40.380 --> 2:09:48.060
 I think my perspective has changed drastically, but not because I've lost the reality that

2:09:48.060 --> 2:09:54.060
 they are the enemy, but I've, I've gained my humanity back again.

2:09:54.060 --> 2:09:55.980
 And that's what I lost when I was there.

2:09:55.980 --> 2:09:57.180
 I lost all humanity.

2:09:57.180 --> 2:09:59.580
 I lost all hope for humanity.

2:09:59.580 --> 2:10:07.180
 He's not wrong when he says the Taliban or like when he was in Iraq, but for me, the

2:10:07.180 --> 2:10:08.460
 Taliban are evil.

2:10:08.460 --> 2:10:15.020
 I still hold a spot of hatred for them that could set this building on fire.

2:10:15.020 --> 2:10:20.880
 You don't, I don't know that anybody can fully understand that when you watch what they do

2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:28.100
 to women and do kids and they do it in the name of God, they are the enemy.

2:10:28.100 --> 2:10:32.240
 They are less than, they don't exist.

2:10:32.240 --> 2:10:36.320
 They're barely worth the bullets we put into them.

2:10:36.320 --> 2:10:45.180
 But then because they use civilians, so like then everybody becomes the enemy.

2:10:45.180 --> 2:10:47.100
 And how are you supposed to make sense of that?

2:10:47.100 --> 2:10:50.140
 Like what you get, but here, Lex, you can't make sense of it.

2:10:50.140 --> 2:10:54.340
 This is why they've done a really good job of blending into the civilian population.

2:10:54.340 --> 2:10:55.420
 They've done it intentionally.

2:10:55.420 --> 2:10:57.740
 They've done it on purpose.

2:10:57.740 --> 2:10:59.420
 So they're brilliant.

2:10:59.420 --> 2:11:01.060
 This is why you guys couldn't beat them.

2:11:01.060 --> 2:11:03.420
 This is why we couldn't fucking beat them.

2:11:03.420 --> 2:11:07.380
 They use their people so effectively.

2:11:07.380 --> 2:11:08.820
 They have no shame in that.

2:11:08.820 --> 2:11:10.240
 They have no issue with that.

2:11:10.240 --> 2:11:14.740
 They take no qualms with wiping a kid off the face of the earth.

2:11:14.740 --> 2:11:18.700
 If it means they can get close enough to a soldier to throw a fucking bomb into their

2:11:18.700 --> 2:11:20.260
 tank.

2:11:20.260 --> 2:11:22.100
 This is why they're affected.

2:11:22.100 --> 2:11:23.800
 How do you beat them then?

2:11:23.800 --> 2:11:30.020
 There's this, there's no winning that you just basically do policeman type work or you

2:11:30.020 --> 2:11:31.020
 do your best.

2:11:31.020 --> 2:11:33.260
 I mean, that's one way.

2:11:33.260 --> 2:11:38.620
 So the other is you come from an artillery background.

2:11:38.620 --> 2:11:42.500
 A fucking hellfire missile hit the whole place off the face of the earth.

2:11:42.500 --> 2:11:45.220
 You can't beat radicalism like that right now.

2:11:45.220 --> 2:11:48.820
 The problem is, is we've, we've let it go unchecked.

2:11:48.820 --> 2:11:52.300
 We had it kind of in check for 20 years.

2:11:52.300 --> 2:11:56.820
 We just shot ourselves in the foot, the chest and the face.

2:11:56.820 --> 2:12:07.340
 So the problem with force is it creates longterm hate because young kids and propaganda and

2:12:07.340 --> 2:12:09.160
 like propaganda works.

2:12:09.160 --> 2:12:14.380
 So you, you see your father, your brother die because of a bomb.

2:12:14.380 --> 2:12:19.420
 It's very easy to convince that person that they died because of evil Americans and tell

2:12:19.420 --> 2:12:22.220
 whatever story you want about America or Canada, Russia.

2:12:22.220 --> 2:12:23.380
 That's the biggest problem.

2:12:23.380 --> 2:12:30.040
 So it seems like there gotta be better solutions because I mean, I talk about love, but it's,

2:12:30.040 --> 2:12:36.940
 it's honestly basically figuring out sneaky ways of empowering women, of educating people

2:12:36.940 --> 2:12:48.620
 of like, and like, and not in a cheesy way, but like in the same level of like mass warfare,

2:12:48.620 --> 2:12:49.620
 but with love.

2:12:49.620 --> 2:12:56.420
 You're talking about DARPA budgets, DOD budgets, but like do that where you educate and empower

2:12:56.420 --> 2:12:58.900
 women by force.

2:12:58.900 --> 2:13:01.140
 And it, you know, they want to learn, right?

2:13:01.140 --> 2:13:05.100
 I mean, you're not like forcing anybody, you're setting them free.

2:13:05.100 --> 2:13:06.100
 That's exactly it.

2:13:06.100 --> 2:13:07.460
 Like combat flip flops does this.

2:13:07.460 --> 2:13:08.460
 They do this.

2:13:08.460 --> 2:13:10.060
 They give literacy.

2:13:10.060 --> 2:13:15.980
 They teach girls to read nothing else to read because as soon as you can read, you know

2:13:15.980 --> 2:13:16.980
 what that happens.

2:13:16.980 --> 2:13:18.220
 You know what happens then.

2:13:18.220 --> 2:13:19.580
 What's combat flip flops?

2:13:19.580 --> 2:13:20.660
 That's the scarf right there.

2:13:20.660 --> 2:13:23.420
 That's made in Afghanistan.

2:13:23.420 --> 2:13:28.340
 So when you buy something from them, the proceeds go to literacy in Afghanistan for girls.

2:13:28.340 --> 2:13:30.660
 They've given literacy to 800 girls over there.

2:13:30.660 --> 2:13:31.660
 Yeah.

2:13:31.660 --> 2:13:32.660
 They're really cool.

2:13:32.660 --> 2:13:37.060
 Uh, Griff owns the one, he was an army ranger and his buddy, but Lee, I think is his name.

2:13:37.060 --> 2:13:41.420
 They were on Shark Tank a long time ago, but they, um, they do shoes and I think they're

2:13:41.420 --> 2:13:42.420
 called Schmongs.

2:13:42.420 --> 2:13:44.740
 I don't know how to say it properly.

2:13:44.740 --> 2:13:45.740
 Built in Afghanistan.

2:13:45.740 --> 2:13:46.740
 Yes.

2:13:46.740 --> 2:13:48.380
 And then the proceeds go back there.

2:13:48.380 --> 2:13:54.000
 They do great work for literacy and you know, as well as anyone, if you can teach someone

2:13:54.000 --> 2:14:01.980
 to read good color, dark, like your soul lacks matches on the inside, just on the inside.

2:14:01.980 --> 2:14:02.980
 All right.

2:14:02.980 --> 2:14:06.460
 The outside is just the, it's just the suit.

2:14:06.460 --> 2:14:10.860
 I feel like you think that's your suit of armor, but I feel like it's, it's there.

2:14:10.860 --> 2:14:11.860
 See what were you saying?

2:14:11.860 --> 2:14:12.860
 Sorry, what were you saying?

2:14:12.860 --> 2:14:13.860
 I was saying go on.

2:14:13.860 --> 2:14:14.860
 I will allow this.

2:14:14.860 --> 2:14:20.900
 All right, I think there is room if you teach education.

2:14:20.900 --> 2:14:24.780
 The problem is we've taken a massive step backwards.

2:14:24.780 --> 2:14:30.820
 I know that the Taliban have just instituted, uh, this week honor killings will be back.

2:14:30.820 --> 2:14:35.180
 Stonings are back and, um, uh, dismemberment as well.

2:14:35.180 --> 2:14:37.940
 Holly McKay is the reporter that's been reporting that from the ground.

2:14:37.940 --> 2:14:39.300
 She's still there.

2:14:39.300 --> 2:14:45.180
 The way to pull people, in my opinion, out of something like that is through education.

2:14:45.180 --> 2:14:51.700
 Well we just took all of that away, which is pretty horrific in my opinion because you've

2:14:51.700 --> 2:14:54.380
 taught over 20 years.

2:14:54.380 --> 2:14:55.520
 You're perfectly right, Lex.

2:14:55.520 --> 2:15:01.540
 When you say that hate and violence won't work, it won't because you see dad get killed

2:15:01.540 --> 2:15:02.540
 on the battlefield.

2:15:02.540 --> 2:15:06.300
 Well that 14 year old little boy is going to pick up an AK 47 and go avenge dad's death.

2:15:06.300 --> 2:15:07.300
 That's just the way it's going to be.

2:15:07.300 --> 2:15:10.340
 Well, we think about it, you were there for 20 years.

2:15:10.340 --> 2:15:11.820
 There's a couple of generations in there.

2:15:11.820 --> 2:15:16.400
 There's another generation that's either grown up in this or has seen enough of this.

2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:22.020
 So there are always going to be a subset that think that we're the enemy and fair.

2:15:22.020 --> 2:15:25.800
 We haven't done always the greatest things, but the one thing that we have done that I

2:15:25.800 --> 2:15:31.620
 did participate in was giving literacy, giving girls an opportunity, letting them know that

2:15:31.620 --> 2:15:33.840
 you aren't second class citizens.

2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:35.740
 You can do things too.

2:15:35.740 --> 2:15:40.660
 And that's why we have to look at war differently.

2:15:40.660 --> 2:15:42.060
 There's times for violence.

2:15:42.060 --> 2:15:50.780
 Oh, there is time for violence and there is time for missiles and there is time for detainees

2:15:50.780 --> 2:15:54.180
 and there's times for bagging tags and double tops of the fucking face.

2:15:54.180 --> 2:15:59.500
 There's times for all of that, but there needs to be more time to educate.

2:15:59.500 --> 2:16:04.420
 The problem is you can't educate if you're in a country where their culture doesn't believe

2:16:04.420 --> 2:16:05.420
 in that.

2:16:05.420 --> 2:16:12.700
 There's so many different things that you, it's an almost an impossible situation.

2:16:12.700 --> 2:16:17.300
 When you look at the 20 years in Afghanistan and we just pulled out, there's a sudden pull

2:16:17.300 --> 2:16:18.300
 out of troops.

2:16:18.300 --> 2:16:21.740
 What do you think about those 20 years?

2:16:21.740 --> 2:16:31.140
 Let me ask hard question, which is, was it worth it going into Afghanistan?

2:16:31.140 --> 2:16:33.460
 And you're sort of, you're one person.

2:16:33.460 --> 2:16:35.100
 My limited capacity.

2:16:35.100 --> 2:16:41.500
 You have experienced specific set of extremely difficult things.

2:16:41.500 --> 2:16:44.020
 You've met a lot of humans.

2:16:44.020 --> 2:16:47.460
 You understand certain aspects of the way this war is carried out.

2:16:47.460 --> 2:16:52.460
 But if you zoomed out at the big story, like you're, you like history too.

2:16:52.460 --> 2:16:59.380
 When you think of the history, a hundred years from now, we look at the invasion of Afghanistan.

2:16:59.380 --> 2:17:04.780
 I don't even think you need to go far that back to know that it was, we went in on false

2:17:04.780 --> 2:17:06.300
 pretenses.

2:17:06.300 --> 2:17:07.300
 We did.

2:17:07.300 --> 2:17:10.460
 That's not, that's not a good start.

2:17:10.460 --> 2:17:11.660
 What's that saying?

2:17:11.660 --> 2:17:18.340
 Future behavior is a good, was it past behavior is a good indicator of future behavior.

2:17:18.340 --> 2:17:24.780
 So I struggle with that because when I first found out that the pullout was going to happen,

2:17:24.780 --> 2:17:33.700
 I got really angry because my government skated the whole situation because he's having a

2:17:33.700 --> 2:17:34.700
 snap.

2:17:34.700 --> 2:17:35.700
 He's having a snap election.

2:17:35.700 --> 2:17:38.220
 It's happening on the 20th.

2:17:38.220 --> 2:17:46.860
 So that was beautifully planned by my government to hold no accountability, zero accountability.

2:17:46.860 --> 2:17:49.100
 And the media won't talk about it.

2:17:49.100 --> 2:17:51.260
 They reached out to me to do an interview about Afghanistan.

2:17:51.260 --> 2:17:54.780
 And then I told them what was going on after I talked to my people that were on the ground

2:17:54.780 --> 2:17:56.820
 and then they canceled the interview.

2:17:56.820 --> 2:18:01.500
 When you say my government, is America any better at this, like it feels like there's

2:18:01.500 --> 2:18:02.500
 no accountability.

2:18:02.500 --> 2:18:03.500
 No, no.

2:18:03.500 --> 2:18:08.860
 The government, no, no, the American government is a dumpster fire.

2:18:08.860 --> 2:18:16.420
 I'm not saying, I'm not saying that, but what I am saying is at least they sent people to

2:18:16.420 --> 2:18:20.300
 pull people or pull some people.

2:18:20.300 --> 2:18:24.400
 We sent no one to pull anyone.

2:18:24.400 --> 2:18:28.420
 And I know for a fact, because I helped move a family, I was fortunate enough to be given

2:18:28.420 --> 2:18:33.620
 an opportunity to help move a high value nine person family out of that country that worked

2:18:33.620 --> 2:18:38.940
 in the government, that worked in prosecuting the Taliban, that were on the top of the list.

2:18:38.940 --> 2:18:42.980
 I learned really quickly the ins and outs of things and I'm really disgusted by it.

2:18:42.980 --> 2:18:48.820
 I learned that Canada had the one email address that all Canadian Afghani visa holders were

2:18:48.820 --> 2:18:54.020
 supposed to email, Ottawa put two people on that email address.

2:18:54.020 --> 2:18:56.020
 That's confirmed.

2:18:56.020 --> 2:18:59.860
 Canada put no more than 70 people on the ground for that pullout and they were not allowed

2:18:59.860 --> 2:19:02.380
 to leave the airport and they left well before the pullout date.

2:19:02.380 --> 2:19:07.340
 They left on the Thursday before the Tuesday that was the 31st.

2:19:07.340 --> 2:19:11.300
 There were high value Canadian visa holders that are still in that country that are on

2:19:11.300 --> 2:19:12.820
 the top of the kill list.

2:19:12.820 --> 2:19:17.020
 Canada's not doing anything about it.

2:19:17.020 --> 2:19:21.740
 I'm disgusted in the way my government has acted because number one, there's an active

2:19:21.740 --> 2:19:27.520
 lawsuit with veterans against the Supreme Court of Canada right now.

2:19:27.520 --> 2:19:33.420
 We are leaving our vets and our Canadians stranded over there and we are leaving the

2:19:33.420 --> 2:19:38.020
 vets that have been maimed by this war in Canada.

2:19:38.020 --> 2:19:39.020
 They're turned down for everything.

2:19:39.020 --> 2:19:40.320
 I've been turned down for hearing loss.

2:19:40.320 --> 2:19:42.820
 They're saying it's not military related.

2:19:42.820 --> 2:19:45.200
 They have PIs follow me.

2:19:45.200 --> 2:19:47.500
 This is normal behavior.

2:19:47.500 --> 2:19:52.860
 There's a veteran named Brock who was told by Trudeau in a meeting that after he lost

2:19:52.860 --> 2:19:57.180
 his leg, he was just trying to get a new prosthetic because it was just killing him.

2:19:57.180 --> 2:20:00.620
 Trudeau stood up in a meeting and said, you're just asking for too much.

2:20:00.620 --> 2:20:05.420
 Less than six months later, he gave $10.4 million to an Afghan terrorist that was in

2:20:05.420 --> 2:20:07.540
 the Canadian prison system.

2:20:07.540 --> 2:20:11.980
 He won and got 10.4 of our million taxpayer dollars.

2:20:11.980 --> 2:20:16.980
 I don't know that American government's any better, but what I do know is that the absolute

2:20:16.980 --> 2:20:21.580
 fucking machines of human beings that stepped outside of the chain of command to pull my

2:20:21.580 --> 2:20:25.260
 family out for me, I know they were there.

2:20:25.260 --> 2:20:30.620
 The British that stayed on the ground that I contacted to literally confirm my biometric

2:20:30.620 --> 2:20:33.740
 data and passports to get that family moved, they weren't there.

2:20:33.740 --> 2:20:35.700
 That family would still be there.

2:20:35.700 --> 2:20:38.540
 That three year old that got the shit kicked out of him by the Taliban that I was trying

2:20:38.540 --> 2:20:44.120
 to exfil, Canada left him.

2:20:44.120 --> 2:20:52.100
 What is it about politicians and governments not willing to do their job?

2:20:52.100 --> 2:21:03.260
 Well, not willing to do a big part of the job, which is you send people to war, these

2:21:03.260 --> 2:21:12.900
 are heroes, and then you should spend most of the time repaying the debts to those, right?

2:21:12.900 --> 2:21:15.740
 What is it about, why can't we?

2:21:15.740 --> 2:21:20.140
 Because we're disposable numbers, and we hire them out of high school when they're stupid

2:21:20.140 --> 2:21:25.300
 enough to not understand what they're going to get themselves into, and then we blame

2:21:25.300 --> 2:21:27.980
 it on themselves for making that decision by volunteering.

2:21:27.980 --> 2:21:32.180
 Yeah, but I mean, this still doesn't make sense to me.

2:21:32.180 --> 2:21:33.180
 No, it's a cop out.

2:21:33.180 --> 2:21:39.500
 I mean, Trudeau, I feel like he is a good human being that wants to do good for, I mean,

2:21:39.500 --> 2:21:45.820
 I tend to, I want to believe that leaders want to do good by the heroes of this world,

2:21:45.820 --> 2:21:53.540
 and it doesn't, like, I don't understand the system of delusion you have to live in to

2:21:53.540 --> 2:21:55.300
 not understand who the heroes are.

2:21:55.300 --> 2:21:58.020
 Like, I refuse to believe Trudeau is somehow a bad person.

2:21:58.020 --> 2:21:59.460
 You haven't met him though, have you?

2:21:59.460 --> 2:22:00.460
 I don't, actually.

2:22:00.460 --> 2:22:06.300
 I'm speaking about Trudeau without knowing, but I mean, in general, think that way about

2:22:06.300 --> 2:22:07.300
 leaders.

2:22:07.300 --> 2:22:12.100
 Like, they surround themselves by people who delude them, who like, they're yes people,

2:22:12.100 --> 2:22:18.820
 yes people that lead them into a kind of reality that becomes detached from actual reality.

2:22:18.820 --> 2:22:21.940
 And so they misunderstand the priorities of this world.

2:22:21.940 --> 2:22:28.900
 They think maybe some kind of special interest, they focus on that versus like the humans.

2:22:28.900 --> 2:22:34.220
 If you look back, was there a way we could have done something better in Afghanistan,

2:22:34.220 --> 2:22:36.560
 assuming we do the invasion?

2:22:36.560 --> 2:22:44.380
 Also, is it ultimately about taking care of the veterans, like, investing more money in

2:22:44.380 --> 2:22:53.840
 the education of women and liberating people who are suffering injustice in those parts

2:22:53.840 --> 2:22:54.840
 of the world?

2:22:54.840 --> 2:22:56.060
 Like, what's a better way to do it?

2:22:56.060 --> 2:23:02.980
 And one other aspect is, on the US side, paid over $6 trillion for the wars in the Middle

2:23:02.980 --> 2:23:06.260
 East since 9 11, so the financial side as well.

2:23:06.260 --> 2:23:11.900
 Is there something you can comment on things we could have done better?

2:23:11.900 --> 2:23:16.620
 That's a loaded question because you're talking to someone who had no hand in what happened

2:23:16.620 --> 2:23:18.500
 other than do this and do that.

2:23:18.500 --> 2:23:22.700
 So I can go from my perspective, which is there was probably plenty of things that we

2:23:22.700 --> 2:23:24.900
 could have been doing better.

2:23:24.900 --> 2:23:27.620
 I think there was a lack of leadership from the get go.

2:23:27.620 --> 2:23:34.580
 I think the preparation that the Canadian military gave me was nowhere sufficient for

2:23:34.580 --> 2:23:37.340
 a deployment of that level.

2:23:37.340 --> 2:23:38.900
 Mind you, things happen.

2:23:38.900 --> 2:23:43.820
 They didn't realize things would happen, but yet they happen.

2:23:43.820 --> 2:23:50.460
 With little to absolutely no cultural idea was that I was walking into.

2:23:50.460 --> 2:23:55.140
 Like when the one male in the family grabbed the back of my vest because my hair was tucked

2:23:55.140 --> 2:23:57.780
 and he thought it was a man going into a room with a bunch of women, I couldn't understand

2:23:57.780 --> 2:24:00.300
 why he was attacking me.

2:24:00.300 --> 2:24:05.540
 There was no real breakdown of this is what you're going into, this is the culture, this

2:24:05.540 --> 2:24:10.580
 is why they do what they do, this is how they do it, this is how you should handle a situation

2:24:10.580 --> 2:24:11.580
 like that.

2:24:11.580 --> 2:24:13.500
 There was none of that.

2:24:13.500 --> 2:24:17.260
 Something I speak about frequently and I think it's important to acknowledge is when you're

2:24:17.260 --> 2:24:21.020
 doing any of that training, we are giving none of our soldiers proper mental health

2:24:21.020 --> 2:24:28.500
 training, tools in that fucking toolbox or ways or things to look for on their buddy

2:24:28.500 --> 2:24:34.060
 because we've created a system and a problem where if you say that you're ill or that you're

2:24:34.060 --> 2:24:36.980
 struggling with PTSD, you're done.

2:24:36.980 --> 2:24:40.060
 No one's going to say that, they're going to keep struggling with it and that's when

2:24:40.060 --> 2:24:45.280
 you get loose cannons, when you get problems happen, so you get fractures start to happen

2:24:45.280 --> 2:24:51.100
 in leadership and that's being seen and has been seen now for a while.

2:24:51.100 --> 2:24:59.980
 In terms of what we could have done, say for a better way to go into the country, a better

2:24:59.980 --> 2:25:07.620
 way to help the country, I can't speak to that as much as I wish I could because I don't

2:25:07.620 --> 2:25:09.260
 know that I would have all the answers.

2:25:09.260 --> 2:25:11.700
 What about withdrawal?

2:25:11.700 --> 2:25:14.220
 Oh my God.

2:25:14.220 --> 2:25:15.220
 That's a cold.

2:25:15.220 --> 2:25:24.260
 Do you think more gradual, you think it's better to maintain presence there for indefinitely?

2:25:24.260 --> 2:25:30.980
 I don't know about that, but I do know we have bases, I say weeks, I serve with them,

2:25:30.980 --> 2:25:36.360
 Americans have bases in Japan, Americans have bases in Korea, Americans have bases in Germany.

2:25:36.360 --> 2:25:38.420
 There's reasons there's bases everywhere.

2:25:38.420 --> 2:25:42.400
 There's a smart, there's an intellectual way to look at this.

2:25:42.400 --> 2:25:47.480
 You want to be able to have eyes and ears, can't have eyes and ears when you do things

2:25:47.480 --> 2:25:49.160
 like you just did.

2:25:49.160 --> 2:25:53.100
 The way that we pulled out of that country, that's right, the way that, I hate saying

2:25:53.100 --> 2:25:54.940
 American British because it puts like a blame on them.

2:25:54.940 --> 2:25:58.940
 I say we because I'm a soldier, I'm a NATO soldier.

2:25:58.940 --> 2:26:03.880
 The way we pulled out of that country, my five year old could have done it better.

2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:07.860
 He could have said, mommy, why are we not keeping that Bagram base?

2:26:07.860 --> 2:26:12.580
 Mommy, why are we not keeping that base just until we get everyone else that we need?

2:26:12.580 --> 2:26:16.340
 Why are we going to a civilian airport that we don't control, that we don't understand?

2:26:16.340 --> 2:26:20.740
 Mommy, why are we doing this when there's only one road to it?

2:26:20.740 --> 2:26:24.660
 My five year old would have that conversation with me.

2:26:24.660 --> 2:26:27.300
 It was so poorly done.

2:26:27.300 --> 2:26:31.740
 It was so poorly executed and no fault of the soldiers on the ground on their own.

2:26:31.740 --> 2:26:36.880
 My God, I can tell you there's operators, I just call them A, I don't say who he is

2:26:36.880 --> 2:26:38.460
 because he's told me not to.

2:26:38.460 --> 2:26:42.740
 There's a guy named A and there's another guy named R and there's a few other named

2:26:42.740 --> 2:26:52.100
 D and these guys, they gave everything to try to pull my family when no one else would

2:26:52.100 --> 2:26:54.620
 pull my family for me.

2:26:54.620 --> 2:26:56.780
 They just got me on the phone and said, I don't know who the fuck you're talking to.

2:26:56.780 --> 2:26:59.440
 I don't know how many people you're trying to get ahold of here, but you've got everyone

2:26:59.440 --> 2:27:00.440
 looking for your family.

2:27:00.440 --> 2:27:02.620
 Six, I've gone to everyone I know.

2:27:02.620 --> 2:27:04.100
 I've done stuff on Instagram.

2:27:04.100 --> 2:27:05.100
 I've got a contact.

2:27:05.100 --> 2:27:06.100
 The contact called me.

2:27:06.100 --> 2:27:07.660
 I called them.

2:27:07.660 --> 2:27:12.860
 I was handling this family and when they call you and say, we can't go back to the gate,

2:27:12.860 --> 2:27:17.740
 my three year old just got beat up by the Taliban and they say, what do we do now?

2:27:17.740 --> 2:27:20.540
 I'm in Vancouver.

2:27:20.540 --> 2:27:23.340
 Why am I being left to deal with this?

2:27:23.340 --> 2:27:27.780
 Why is the civilian and ex military population being left to deal with this?

2:27:27.780 --> 2:27:29.620
 Why was this not thought out?

2:27:29.620 --> 2:27:31.980
 We knew this was coming.

2:27:31.980 --> 2:27:33.460
 We knew the timeframe.

2:27:33.460 --> 2:27:38.940
 Yeah, I ultimately blame, it almost starts at the top always at the leadership, sorry,

2:27:38.940 --> 2:27:41.940
 this is the civilian leadership.

2:27:41.940 --> 2:27:46.460
 I think probably the generals know the right thing to do here.

2:27:46.460 --> 2:27:51.460
 Even if they're sometimes overzealous in terms of being, wanting to increase, I think the

2:27:51.460 --> 2:27:53.620
 great generals understand what's needed.

2:27:53.620 --> 2:27:57.420
 And then it takes great leadership on the civilian side to listen to the generals and

2:27:57.420 --> 2:28:00.900
 understand that war is not just about like.

2:28:00.900 --> 2:28:02.220
 It's not binary.

2:28:02.220 --> 2:28:07.620
 Yeah, and it's not about the invasion and saying mission accomplished.

2:28:07.620 --> 2:28:08.820
 It's not about the PR.

2:28:08.820 --> 2:28:13.100
 It's about the full complexity of geopolitics.

2:28:13.100 --> 2:28:14.100
 Can I ask you this?

2:28:14.100 --> 2:28:16.380
 You can ask me whatever you want.

2:28:16.380 --> 2:28:18.660
 I'm looking at a book that you gave me, Do the Fucking Work.

2:28:18.660 --> 2:28:19.660
 It's very motivating.

2:28:19.660 --> 2:28:21.900
 Good Fucking Design Advice.

2:28:21.900 --> 2:28:24.860
 That's their company called Good Fucking Design Advice.

2:28:24.860 --> 2:28:25.860
 That's great.

2:28:25.860 --> 2:28:26.860
 I know, they're great.

2:28:26.860 --> 2:28:27.860
 What's the website?

2:28:27.860 --> 2:28:28.860
 GFDA.

2:28:28.860 --> 2:28:32.380
 Okay, so the F is for friendship.

2:28:32.380 --> 2:28:33.380
 Something like that.

2:28:33.380 --> 2:28:35.420
 They are a design company.

2:28:35.420 --> 2:28:37.620
 They've worked with Apple and Nike, and this is their book.

2:28:37.620 --> 2:28:39.420
 It's been published by HarperCollins.

2:28:39.420 --> 2:28:44.900
 And it is really just, it's an incredible, they're an incredible company.

2:28:44.900 --> 2:28:49.580
 They're artistically, like they're a design company, so you can see that.

2:28:49.580 --> 2:28:50.700
 You can see it's a design company.

2:28:50.700 --> 2:28:52.500
 Oh yeah, they signed it for you.

2:28:52.500 --> 2:28:58.780
 And the pages are beautiful, but they have a saying and then a paragraph about each saying.

2:28:58.780 --> 2:29:04.420
 Get fucking started, obstacles are fucking opportunities, fail, fail, and fucking fail

2:29:04.420 --> 2:29:05.420
 again.

2:29:05.420 --> 2:29:11.820
 Ask for fucking help, show some fucking passion, finish the fucking job.

2:29:11.820 --> 2:29:12.820
 That's right.

2:29:12.820 --> 2:29:13.820
 So we should send that to Biden.

2:29:13.820 --> 2:29:15.340
 So I...

2:29:15.340 --> 2:29:16.620
 She said it, I didn't say it.

2:29:16.620 --> 2:29:17.620
 Lex said it.

2:29:17.620 --> 2:29:18.620
 I didn't say it.

2:29:18.620 --> 2:29:19.620
 Lex said it.

2:29:19.620 --> 2:29:20.620
 It's fine.

2:29:20.620 --> 2:29:21.620
 I'll say it.

2:29:21.620 --> 2:29:22.620
 I should also send it to Trudeau as well.

2:29:22.620 --> 2:29:23.940
 So, but I mean, he probably won't know how to read it.

2:29:23.940 --> 2:29:25.900
 He just taught drama instead.

2:29:25.900 --> 2:29:29.340
 So I'll send it to the previous four presidents.

2:29:29.340 --> 2:29:30.340
 How about that?

2:29:30.340 --> 2:29:31.340
 That's fine.

2:29:31.340 --> 2:29:32.340
 We can also send it to them too.

2:29:32.340 --> 2:29:33.340
 Cause they're all just as much at fault.

2:29:33.340 --> 2:29:38.740
 So, and they, most of them have all the same last names, but okay.

2:29:38.740 --> 2:29:39.740
 Let me tell you about them quickly.

2:29:39.740 --> 2:29:42.460
 Cause we did a mug with them and I was really excited about it.

2:29:42.460 --> 2:29:43.460
 Not because it was a mug.

2:29:43.460 --> 2:29:47.060
 I'm a mug person, but you are, that's your mug obsessive.

2:29:47.060 --> 2:29:48.460
 I'm obsessive about my mugs.

2:29:48.460 --> 2:29:50.260
 What's your favorite mug?

2:29:50.260 --> 2:29:51.260
 Currently it's mine right now.

2:29:51.260 --> 2:29:52.260
 The one that I have with them.

2:29:52.260 --> 2:29:53.260
 Okay.

2:29:53.260 --> 2:29:54.260
 The GMT mug.

2:29:54.260 --> 2:29:55.260
 What does it say on it?

2:29:55.260 --> 2:29:57.580
 Can I, do you want me to read what it says on it?

2:29:57.580 --> 2:29:58.580
 Yeah, please.

2:29:58.580 --> 2:29:59.580
 Okay.

2:29:59.580 --> 2:30:04.620
 Cause I'm really happy about it because we created this with them, with GFDA.

2:30:04.620 --> 2:30:09.720
 I found out about them because my husband's office, Atlas Neck Brace, he had his very

2:30:09.720 --> 2:30:14.300
 first office, he had one of their prints done and it was their original, like do the fucking

2:30:14.300 --> 2:30:15.860
 work.

2:30:15.860 --> 2:30:20.860
 And I was really excited about them once I found out because I'm like, well, fuck is

2:30:20.860 --> 2:30:22.260
 my middle name.

2:30:22.260 --> 2:30:28.740
 And I want to make sure that I am going to, whoever I work with, I want to make sure that

2:30:28.740 --> 2:30:35.500
 I'm working with people that I believe in, that I believe what they stand for and I just

2:30:35.500 --> 2:30:36.500
 think they're brilliant.

2:30:36.500 --> 2:30:42.020
 So I got on the phone with them and I said, hi, I would like you to sponsor my podcast.

2:30:42.020 --> 2:30:43.020
 And they said, cool.

2:30:43.020 --> 2:30:44.340
 What's your podcast?

2:30:44.340 --> 2:30:49.540
 And I was like, it's called Brass in Unity podcast and I want to work with you guys somewhere.

2:30:49.540 --> 2:30:52.320
 And they're like, okay, so like, what are you thinking?

2:30:52.320 --> 2:30:56.980
 And I said, you know, I'm looking to do, I would love one day to do something with you.

2:30:56.980 --> 2:31:00.420
 I don't know what it would be, but I would like it to be something.

2:31:00.420 --> 2:31:03.780
 And they said, you know, we do like, we have this book, but we also have like shirts and

2:31:03.780 --> 2:31:06.320
 mugs with our sayings on them and prints.

2:31:06.320 --> 2:31:11.140
 And so I was thinking to myself, I was like, well, if I just did like a mug with them,

2:31:11.140 --> 2:31:15.260
 well then I could, you know, that could work for what my company does, which is it's a

2:31:15.260 --> 2:31:20.020
 jewelry company and sunglass company, but it could be like an add on kind of deal.

2:31:20.020 --> 2:31:21.260
 These guys are really good designers.

2:31:21.260 --> 2:31:22.260
 I can already tell.

2:31:22.260 --> 2:31:23.260
 Yeah.

2:31:23.260 --> 2:31:24.260
 I knew you would like this.

2:31:24.260 --> 2:31:25.260
 That's why I brought it.

2:31:25.260 --> 2:31:27.160
 So I'm like, certain people would appreciate this.

2:31:27.160 --> 2:31:33.940
 And so my whole thing, my, my like hashtag is work hard, help harder.

2:31:33.940 --> 2:31:35.820
 And that's the whole concept of what I do now.

2:31:35.820 --> 2:31:38.860
 And so we did a mug and it's called fucking help somebody.

2:31:38.860 --> 2:31:40.340
 That's their like first tag.

2:31:40.340 --> 2:31:47.420
 And then the rest is kindness is a wealth that increases as it is given away.

2:31:47.420 --> 2:31:51.140
 What you get in return isn't passed between hands, but felt between hearts.

2:31:51.140 --> 2:31:55.460
 It's precisely because you've been at the bottom that you can raise others up.

2:31:55.460 --> 2:31:58.940
 It's because you've, sorry, I'm reading a photo here.

2:31:58.940 --> 2:32:00.200
 You've been lost in the dark.

2:32:00.200 --> 2:32:02.460
 You can lead others to the light.

2:32:02.460 --> 2:32:07.860
 It's because you fought with yourself that you can bring peace to someone else.

2:32:07.860 --> 2:32:13.000
 You now have the strength because you've once struggled the best you have to come, the best

2:32:13.000 --> 2:32:16.900
 you have to come from the fucking worst you've had to take.

2:32:16.900 --> 2:32:20.020
 So it's, this is the mug there and we're sold out of them.

2:32:20.020 --> 2:32:21.020
 We just got a bunch of.

2:32:21.020 --> 2:32:22.020
 What does it say?

2:32:22.020 --> 2:32:23.020
 Fucking help.

2:32:23.020 --> 2:32:24.020
 Fucking help somebody.

2:32:24.020 --> 2:32:25.020
 Fucking help somebody.

2:32:25.020 --> 2:32:29.860
 And so we did, they were so gracious enough to sit with me and be like, what do you want

2:32:29.860 --> 2:32:30.900
 the copy to be like?

2:32:30.900 --> 2:32:33.340
 And I said, what do you think I want it to be like?

2:32:33.340 --> 2:32:35.020
 What would you, if you could write one for me, what it'd be?

2:32:35.020 --> 2:32:37.300
 And they're like, it's going to be around lifting people up.

2:32:37.300 --> 2:32:39.020
 And I was like, okay, cool.

2:32:39.020 --> 2:32:40.380
 And they're like, do you want fuck in the title?

2:32:40.380 --> 2:32:43.420
 And I was like, every other word, if we can have it.

2:32:43.420 --> 2:32:44.620
 And they said, we'll just do once.

2:32:44.620 --> 2:32:46.520
 And I was like, okay, I compromise.

2:32:46.520 --> 2:32:49.900
 And so we came up with that copy and we put it on a mug and we're going to be doing a

2:32:49.900 --> 2:32:50.900
 shirt with them.

2:32:50.900 --> 2:32:58.460
 But the, the whole thing to me was that, that embodied what I stand for now and the healing

2:32:58.460 --> 2:33:04.480
 I've gotten to now and the point I've gotten to now in my life, because that fucking sand

2:33:04.480 --> 2:33:10.340
 pit almost broke me, like off the face of the earth broke me.

2:33:10.340 --> 2:33:17.380
 First of all, can we go through the full journey of that in terms of your psychological development?

2:33:17.380 --> 2:33:19.780
 Who were you before?

2:33:19.780 --> 2:33:20.780
 Who were you after?

2:33:20.780 --> 2:33:22.560
 Can you think about that?

2:33:22.560 --> 2:33:29.340
 Like what was your, if you had to put a brain on the table before and after and try to analyze

2:33:29.340 --> 2:33:30.340
 it?

2:33:30.340 --> 2:33:31.340
 Well, they both have CTE.

2:33:31.340 --> 2:33:38.660
 So we know that they're both bruised and gray matter is a little dicey on them.

2:33:38.660 --> 2:33:42.660
 And it may sound the same and it's, it's not, so I'll try to explain it to you.

2:33:42.660 --> 2:33:47.260
 Before that, don't you laugh because I can, I know it's coming.

2:33:47.260 --> 2:33:52.500
 I was even louder, even more obnoxious, even more outgoing.

2:33:52.500 --> 2:33:54.060
 I know it's hard to believe.

2:33:54.060 --> 2:33:57.500
 This is you humble and quiet right now.

2:33:57.500 --> 2:34:01.140
 This is normal me now.

2:34:01.140 --> 2:34:02.180
 This is who I am now.

2:34:02.180 --> 2:34:03.180
 And I love that.

2:34:03.180 --> 2:34:12.460
 But who I was before I was, you know, motocross, taekwondo, tomboy.

2:34:12.460 --> 2:34:14.860
 I didn't know how to dress.

2:34:14.860 --> 2:34:17.940
 I thought that if you just wore like the same jeans and t shirt all the time, that was like

2:34:17.940 --> 2:34:20.340
 acceptable behavior as a woman.

2:34:20.340 --> 2:34:21.900
 I wore skate shoes.

2:34:21.900 --> 2:34:25.540
 I went to a Catholic school that I refused to wear skirt at.

2:34:25.540 --> 2:34:26.540
 I wore pants.

2:34:26.540 --> 2:34:27.780
 I played hacky sack.

2:34:27.780 --> 2:34:32.540
 I was so into sports, I cut and split wood with my dad on weekends.

2:34:32.540 --> 2:34:34.580
 We heated our house that way.

2:34:34.580 --> 2:34:35.820
 I would go on the transport.

2:34:35.820 --> 2:34:42.020
 I stayed out of trouble for the most part.

2:34:42.020 --> 2:34:43.220
 I think I was a fairly good kid.

2:34:43.220 --> 2:34:46.700
 I was pretty angry though for most of my teenage life after my coach.

2:34:46.700 --> 2:34:49.620
 I lost my way a little bit there.

2:34:49.620 --> 2:34:52.620
 I was just crazier.

2:34:52.620 --> 2:34:54.380
 But happy?

2:34:54.380 --> 2:34:55.460
 I don't know if I was happy.

2:34:55.460 --> 2:34:56.880
 I'm realizing that now.

2:34:56.880 --> 2:35:01.900
 I think I was, I think anger overtook who I was, and I think that's why I was such an

2:35:01.900 --> 2:35:04.540
 angry individual towards my parents when I was in high school.

2:35:04.540 --> 2:35:08.820
 So parents, was it a little rough relationship with parents?

2:35:08.820 --> 2:35:09.820
 I mean, yeah.

2:35:09.820 --> 2:35:12.580
 I mean, my dad was gone a couple of weeks at a time.

2:35:12.580 --> 2:35:16.680
 So my mom, stay at home mom, had to handle me and my brother, who were both competitive

2:35:16.680 --> 2:35:19.540
 athletes at the time, by herself.

2:35:19.540 --> 2:35:23.240
 And when you come home and you have a daughter that just calls you like a bitch to your face

2:35:23.240 --> 2:35:29.100
 because she can't, she's being bullied so bad that she can't understand why, but also

2:35:29.100 --> 2:35:34.980
 doesn't know how to fix it, but has no other outlet anymore to kind of get rid of it.

2:35:34.980 --> 2:35:36.020
 I was not nice.

2:35:36.020 --> 2:35:37.260
 I was a really mean person.

2:35:37.260 --> 2:35:38.380
 I broke my mom.

2:35:38.380 --> 2:35:40.260
 I remember the day she stopped yelling.

2:35:40.260 --> 2:35:41.260
 That's the day I know I broke her.

2:35:41.260 --> 2:35:42.260
 I broke her.

2:35:42.260 --> 2:35:44.940
 Did you have a source of discipline in your life?

2:35:44.940 --> 2:35:50.020
 Like, what, like maybe like your dad, somebody who says you're being a bitch.

2:35:50.020 --> 2:35:52.340
 Oh, like who would call me like that?

2:35:52.340 --> 2:35:53.620
 Oh no, no, no, no.

2:35:53.620 --> 2:35:54.620
 My parents were incredible.

2:35:54.620 --> 2:35:58.500
 And my dad came from like a family of like a bajillion kids who lived in a farm with

2:35:58.500 --> 2:36:03.640
 no running water with like super, my dad was brash and abrupt.

2:36:03.640 --> 2:36:05.520
 So like I've caught myself doing that once in a while.

2:36:05.520 --> 2:36:11.460
 So like if I did one thing wrong, if he was just in a mood, I would know it.

2:36:11.460 --> 2:36:13.520
 So you weren't, okay.

2:36:13.520 --> 2:36:15.780
 So that anger just took different forms.

2:36:15.780 --> 2:36:19.820
 It took different forms, but it mostly would be directed at my mom because I know she would

2:36:19.820 --> 2:36:22.600
 take it and that was who I had.

2:36:22.600 --> 2:36:24.420
 And I feel bad about it to the day.

2:36:24.420 --> 2:36:28.060
 Like I still, she listened to the Jocko podcast and so did my dad.

2:36:28.060 --> 2:36:30.700
 And my mom promised me she would never read my book because there's certain parts.

2:36:30.700 --> 2:36:35.340
 I just, my dad on my deployment, when I called him and told him some of the stuff, he started

2:36:35.340 --> 2:36:36.340
 crying.

2:36:36.340 --> 2:36:37.340
 My dad doesn't cry.

2:36:37.340 --> 2:36:40.520
 And he just said, please never tell your mother this.

2:36:40.520 --> 2:36:41.640
 Don't do that to your mom.

2:36:41.640 --> 2:36:44.500
 My mom, like my grandfather came from Hungary.

2:36:44.500 --> 2:36:49.400
 He escaped when the Nazis left, when the Soviets came in.

2:36:49.400 --> 2:36:53.300
 He wasn't great as a dad.

2:36:53.300 --> 2:36:59.860
 My mom went through a lot as a kid and that was because her dad was in the war.

2:36:59.860 --> 2:37:06.480
 That was because her dad didn't know any better and she knew she couldn't be like that.

2:37:06.480 --> 2:37:10.300
 So her way would be yelling.

2:37:10.300 --> 2:37:16.020
 And then I hit about 16 and I wore her down and I broke her, shattered her ability to

2:37:16.020 --> 2:37:20.120
 think that she could have any sort of relationship with me.

2:37:20.120 --> 2:37:22.860
 You wouldn't want to have had a relationship with me.

2:37:22.860 --> 2:37:26.500
 But the funny thing is you've rediscovered that now.

2:37:26.500 --> 2:37:29.300
 So she, is she, are you guys close now?

2:37:29.300 --> 2:37:30.300
 Yeah.

2:37:30.300 --> 2:37:31.820
 She's, she's so funny.

2:37:31.820 --> 2:37:33.340
 She's coming out to help out again.

2:37:33.340 --> 2:37:39.140
 She comes out to help out with Jack all the time and my dad, they're still, they're still

2:37:39.140 --> 2:37:40.140
 truck drivers.

2:37:40.140 --> 2:37:41.140
 They're still on the road.

2:37:41.140 --> 2:37:42.140
 They team drive.

2:37:42.140 --> 2:37:44.100
 They have their little dogs and they go and they do their thing.

2:37:44.100 --> 2:37:48.580
 And I've had that relationship now it's, it's, it's still strenuous.

2:37:48.580 --> 2:37:52.620
 Like I still, when I'm having a hard time, she'll be the person I'll take it out on because

2:37:52.620 --> 2:37:53.980
 I know she can take it.

2:37:53.980 --> 2:37:59.940
 Even though I know I shouldn't, it's like, she's my safe space to be like, blah, about

2:37:59.940 --> 2:38:00.940
 everything.

2:38:00.940 --> 2:38:01.940
 And she'll just be like, well, that's not nice.

2:38:01.940 --> 2:38:03.100
 I'm like, well, you're not, fuck it.

2:38:03.100 --> 2:38:04.860
 Like I, and I'll take it out on her.

2:38:04.860 --> 2:38:11.420
 She knows I don't mean it and I try, um, but for whatever reason, she just, she takes it

2:38:11.420 --> 2:38:12.420
 and um,

2:38:12.420 --> 2:38:13.420
 And it brings it out of you.

2:38:13.420 --> 2:38:14.420
 Yeah.

2:38:14.420 --> 2:38:20.900
 Can you describe sort of the various characteristics, the, the shape of your PTSD, the trauma, how

2:38:20.900 --> 2:38:28.220
 the anger and hate took shape in you in the, in the seconds, minutes, hours, months, years

2:38:28.220 --> 2:38:33.980
 after and after the, the full trauma of all the things you've experienced in Afghanistan.

2:38:33.980 --> 2:38:37.620
 So it's funny because Jocko asked me something and it made me, it's made me, I've really

2:38:37.620 --> 2:38:42.620
 been thinking a lot about it and he's like, do you think if somebody of the leadership

2:38:42.620 --> 2:38:50.540
 would have just sat you down and said, Hey, Burns, what you're feeling is okay, what you're

2:38:50.540 --> 2:38:56.380
 feeling is normal, what you're feeling is what happens when you're in something like

2:38:56.380 --> 2:38:57.380
 this.

2:38:57.380 --> 2:38:58.380
 Do you think you would be where you are?

2:38:58.380 --> 2:39:02.300
 And I said, well, I thought about it and I'm like, you know, I don't think I would

2:39:02.300 --> 2:39:05.660
 be because I wouldn't have been medicated out of my mind.

2:39:05.660 --> 2:39:10.220
 I wasn't able to process anything because I was just given medication right from the

2:39:10.220 --> 2:39:11.220
 get.

2:39:11.220 --> 2:39:17.020
 And for me, what happened was once that light switch was off, um, I was sent back to Kandahar

2:39:17.020 --> 2:39:22.420
 to what I, once the operation was over, we, we flew back to Kandahar, like with the Brits.

2:39:22.420 --> 2:39:26.900
 And then because there was deaths and we lost people on that operation, I had to go to the

2:39:26.900 --> 2:39:33.180
 British side for the next, I think three or four days and recant word for word why, what

2:39:33.180 --> 2:39:37.780
 happened to a British MP who hand wrote statements, but we had to do that on repeat to make sure

2:39:37.780 --> 2:39:42.460
 we all had the same story and so nobody shot anybody in the back.

2:39:42.460 --> 2:39:47.740
 And so that I don't think is a great way to do that after an after action, after action

2:39:47.740 --> 2:39:52.860
 reports happen, but I don't think beating a dead horse and having somebody repeat, repeat,

2:39:52.860 --> 2:39:55.420
 repeat, and then just imprint more and more and more.

2:39:55.420 --> 2:39:58.260
 I don't, I don't know that that is a great way of doing that.

2:39:58.260 --> 2:39:59.260
 Um,

2:39:59.260 --> 2:40:04.580
 And especially from a perspective of what are they, uh, liability almost like legal,

2:40:04.580 --> 2:40:08.780
 that kind of that perspective as opposed to the full perspective.

2:40:08.780 --> 2:40:15.740
 I mean, so, so for people who don't know, uh, one is the, the, the overmedication and

2:40:15.740 --> 2:40:18.300
 that you had to undergo.

2:40:18.300 --> 2:40:24.980
 And then the other is the social isolation in terms of, I mean, more than what Jaco,

2:40:24.980 --> 2:40:31.660
 what you just mentioned, you also kind of, uh, mentioned that just being with, um, with

2:40:31.660 --> 2:40:37.660
 other soldiers you're close with, just sitting there in silence and, um, just sitting in

2:40:37.660 --> 2:40:45.500
 that shared understanding, even that in itself communicates like these feelings are normal.

2:40:45.500 --> 2:40:51.860
 Like you don't have to talk and you were robbed of that as well, essentially.

2:40:51.860 --> 2:40:52.860
 Yeah.

2:40:52.860 --> 2:40:56.100
 Because I was, because I was borrowed, I think Jaco had a name for us when we get borrowed.

2:40:56.100 --> 2:40:59.300
 It was like, there was like a, I don't know what they call us, but it's like when you

2:40:59.300 --> 2:41:01.660
 take a person and you put them in another unit, there's a name for it.

2:41:01.660 --> 2:41:03.180
 I don't remember what it was.

2:41:03.180 --> 2:41:05.380
 You never see those people again.

2:41:05.380 --> 2:41:10.060
 But because I was in Kanderhart, the doctors gave me the medication because I, I think

2:41:10.060 --> 2:41:12.140
 I was the one who said, I don't, this isn't right.

2:41:12.140 --> 2:41:13.140
 I don't feel right.

2:41:13.140 --> 2:41:14.140
 This is wrong.

2:41:14.140 --> 2:41:17.420
 Cause when I got back that night, there was supposed to be somebody there to pick me up,

2:41:17.420 --> 2:41:20.300
 to take me to the other side of the base and no one showed.

2:41:20.300 --> 2:41:26.620
 So I, I humped on my kit back to the Canada house and I remember getting in the shower

2:41:26.620 --> 2:41:32.660
 and the rule was quick fucking showers, no water.

2:41:32.660 --> 2:41:37.980
 I must've sat on that floor, that shower for half an hour, 45 minutes.

2:41:37.980 --> 2:41:41.420
 I just held myself and cried and didn't even know why I was crying.

2:41:41.420 --> 2:41:50.820
 I just knew I needed to cry and I still this day, I, and when they sent me back to the

2:41:50.820 --> 2:41:58.260
 FOB, they sent me back with all this medication after spending that time with the Brits and

2:41:58.260 --> 2:42:01.340
 they put me back on the guns, medicated out of my fucking tree.

2:42:01.340 --> 2:42:07.060
 I almost shot someone, but they didn't tell my staff that I was on meds.

2:42:07.060 --> 2:42:11.340
 So when the artillery gun was going off and I didn't run to the gun and I was still asleep

2:42:11.340 --> 2:42:16.940
 inside the tent with the gun beside my head, they didn't know I was just drugged.

2:42:16.940 --> 2:42:20.180
 They just thought I was fucking off somewhere, hanging out with some Americans.

2:42:20.180 --> 2:42:24.060
 They just thought I wasn't doing any of what I should be doing.

2:42:24.060 --> 2:42:28.740
 And then I remember the moment my Sergeant, we did a night shoot and he, he's so funny

2:42:28.740 --> 2:42:33.700
 because he called me and goes, ah, fuck, Burns, I remember this, yes, you were standing there

2:42:33.700 --> 2:42:37.900
 with me and I look at you and go, hey, Burns, are you okay?

2:42:37.900 --> 2:42:42.340
 Because your eyes are all fucked.

2:42:42.340 --> 2:42:46.740
 And I, I looked at Sergeant LeBlanc and I just remember going, yeah, I'm good.

2:42:46.740 --> 2:42:47.740
 Like just huh.

2:42:47.740 --> 2:42:51.060
 He's like, I still remember that.

2:42:51.060 --> 2:42:52.060
 And I'm like, I know.

2:42:52.060 --> 2:42:56.420
 And he goes, they never tell me anything, fuck, Burns, I did not know the drugs you

2:42:56.420 --> 2:42:57.420
 were on.

2:42:57.420 --> 2:43:01.980
 And as I was on all of them, he goes, I know I walk in, you show me the bottles, ah, fuck,

2:43:01.980 --> 2:43:05.300
 Burns, you shouldn't have been there.

2:43:05.300 --> 2:43:06.780
 I guarantee he sounds just like that.

2:43:06.780 --> 2:43:07.780
 You'll find out.

2:43:07.780 --> 2:43:08.780
 He's brilliant.

2:43:08.780 --> 2:43:09.780
 He's brilliant.

2:43:09.780 --> 2:43:19.540
 Yeah, so what, I mean, I suppose this is a lazy way of dealing with trauma and it's for

2:43:19.540 --> 2:43:21.540
 the military in some sense.

2:43:21.540 --> 2:43:25.580
 If you don't have a good program in place, this makes sense, but you should have a good

2:43:25.580 --> 2:43:26.580
 program in place.

2:43:26.580 --> 2:43:32.540
 Just like you said, on the prep, on the mental prep side, like just any prep, like training

2:43:32.540 --> 2:43:38.660
 people, training people on the, I suppose to, I guess train the fact that you're going

2:43:38.660 --> 2:43:45.020
 to have somebody close to you blow up, like you have to probably visualize that.

2:43:45.020 --> 2:43:46.020
 You have to think through that.

2:43:46.020 --> 2:43:50.620
 You have to have a process of how to deal with something like that, with that kind of

2:43:50.620 --> 2:43:51.620
 trauma.

2:43:51.620 --> 2:43:52.620
 And then that's it.

2:43:52.620 --> 2:43:54.620
 Tools in the toolbox is what the doctors call it.

2:43:54.620 --> 2:43:55.620
 Exactly.

2:43:55.620 --> 2:43:58.140
 I mean, and it's not like weakness, it's actually strength.

2:43:58.140 --> 2:44:04.040
 It's like you have to be mentally strong enough to process that.

2:44:04.040 --> 2:44:09.500
 That probably takes a lot of training, but it's a great training, right?

2:44:09.500 --> 2:44:13.020
 Well worth it to protect your investment training.

2:44:13.020 --> 2:44:14.020
 Right.

2:44:14.020 --> 2:44:16.660
 That's a very cold, but correct way to put it.

2:44:16.660 --> 2:44:17.660
 I mean, it's cold.

2:44:17.660 --> 2:44:22.420
 I thought you would appreciate the coldness of the way I articulated that.

2:44:22.420 --> 2:44:23.420
 Well, yeah.

2:44:23.420 --> 2:44:25.540
 I mean, I'm of two minds in this.

2:44:25.540 --> 2:44:32.500
 I don't, I sometimes wonder like what I would be like as a soldier, actually.

2:44:32.500 --> 2:44:36.460
 I don't know, because I love country and I love all the things you're mentioning.

2:44:36.460 --> 2:44:42.060
 Like I could see myself probably dying for my country and also enjoying the skill of

2:44:42.060 --> 2:44:43.060
 it.

2:44:43.060 --> 2:44:48.020
 The very like OCD, like very proficient.

2:44:48.020 --> 2:44:49.020
 Yeah.

2:44:49.020 --> 2:44:53.340
 But then also the human side, I fall in love with people.

2:44:53.340 --> 2:44:54.540
 I fall in love with everything.

2:44:54.540 --> 2:45:00.420
 So I don't know, I suppose you have to shut off the part of your brain when you're executing

2:45:00.420 --> 2:45:09.780
 a mission that cares about other humans outside your close knit group.

2:45:09.780 --> 2:45:11.900
 Like there's no time for philosophical thinking.

2:45:11.900 --> 2:45:12.900
 I don't know.

2:45:12.900 --> 2:45:15.380
 I suppose that's why it's better to be young.

2:45:15.380 --> 2:45:17.700
 Young and dumb.

2:45:17.700 --> 2:45:19.300
 You're not necessarily dumb.

2:45:19.300 --> 2:45:27.580
 It's just like you were over that energy of excitement of proficiency and excellence is

2:45:27.580 --> 2:45:30.380
 just higher than it is later in life.

2:45:30.380 --> 2:45:32.660
 You're not dumb.

2:45:32.660 --> 2:45:46.540
 I was not dumb, but I was naive, uneducated, not well trained and had an arrogance because

2:45:46.540 --> 2:45:49.300
 we were told we were the fucking shit.

2:45:49.300 --> 2:45:50.300
 Yeah.

2:45:50.300 --> 2:45:51.300
 You're amazing.

2:45:51.300 --> 2:45:52.300
 Okay.

2:45:52.300 --> 2:45:53.300
 I'm amazing.

2:45:53.300 --> 2:45:56.380
 So I wonder, do they think if we do mental training?

2:45:56.380 --> 2:45:57.540
 That makes you weak.

2:45:57.540 --> 2:46:00.260
 Do you think the military thinks that makes you weak?

2:46:00.260 --> 2:46:01.260
 Well, yes.

2:46:01.260 --> 2:46:05.780
 And the reason I can say that is because it's obvious in the way that they handle it now.

2:46:05.780 --> 2:46:09.540
 So like if a soldier says, hey, I'm really struggling with that last op we were on, man,

2:46:09.540 --> 2:46:13.620
 it's just really, it's getting to me, I'm having a hard time sleeping.

2:46:13.620 --> 2:46:19.740
 They're going to go, okay, well, how, how hard of a time sleeping are you having?

2:46:19.740 --> 2:46:22.780
 And then you get that re and you go, oh no, I'm not, it's not that bad.

2:46:22.780 --> 2:46:24.580
 I'm not, I don't need anything for it.

2:46:24.580 --> 2:46:26.420
 Like I'm just like once in a while I'm losing some sleep.

2:46:26.420 --> 2:46:27.420
 They're like, okay.

2:46:27.420 --> 2:46:31.340
 Because you know that pen moves, it's all getting written down and then you're dead

2:46:31.340 --> 2:46:33.580
 red, you're dead red, which means you're not deploying again.

2:46:33.580 --> 2:46:34.580
 Yeah.

2:46:34.580 --> 2:46:36.660
 And then you're not able to do the thing you love the most with the people you love the

2:46:36.660 --> 2:46:37.660
 most.

2:46:37.660 --> 2:46:38.660
 Right.

2:46:38.660 --> 2:46:44.100
 I mean, but also this is really difficult and I'd love to talk to you about PTSD, but

2:46:44.100 --> 2:46:45.100
 like.

2:46:45.100 --> 2:46:46.100
 Sorry.

2:46:46.100 --> 2:46:47.100
 Yes.

2:46:47.100 --> 2:46:48.100
 I keep going off.

2:46:48.100 --> 2:46:49.100
 No, please.

2:46:49.100 --> 2:47:01.260
 So I'm, I'm hoping to, um, like launch a company, you know, in the engineering space and the,

2:47:01.260 --> 2:47:08.980
 and I currently lead, I've led a few people and it's always this kind of, um, like how

2:47:08.980 --> 2:47:14.420
 much are you supposed to push people because people are, everyone is weak and lazy.

2:47:14.420 --> 2:47:17.540
 Are you quoting her text messages from earlier?

2:47:17.540 --> 2:47:18.540
 Yeah, exactly.

2:47:18.540 --> 2:47:21.180
 I'm quoting, all I have is just quotes from you.

2:47:21.180 --> 2:47:22.180
 That's okay.

2:47:22.180 --> 2:47:26.540
 Uh, tells me how much we've spoken in the past week, poor soul.

2:47:26.540 --> 2:47:31.580
 I just, I don't know what to do because sometimes people are really struggling, like really

2:47:31.580 --> 2:47:34.140
 struggling in a way with their being there.

2:47:34.140 --> 2:47:39.580
 Like it's the, it's the Goggins thing is like, where's the line to where you're actually

2:47:39.580 --> 2:47:45.780
 breaking the human being versus where you're breaking them at the places where they will

2:47:45.780 --> 2:47:47.820
 grow back stronger.

2:47:47.820 --> 2:47:52.300
 Like in that line is tricky, uh, to, to truly understand.

2:47:52.300 --> 2:47:58.820
 I think the military eras on the side of like, they, you know, like push them beyond all

2:47:58.820 --> 2:48:03.940
 limits, physical, physical, but mental, they don't, they need to respect the mental more.

2:48:03.940 --> 2:48:06.100
 Uh, they fuck with the brain a little bit.

2:48:06.100 --> 2:48:09.460
 I mean, in basic training, they like scream in your face and to see who's going to crack

2:48:09.460 --> 2:48:13.740
 and they, they put you on sleep deprivation to see who's weak enough that they can't handle

2:48:13.740 --> 2:48:14.740
 sleep depth.

2:48:14.740 --> 2:48:16.300
 They'll, they do stuff to you.

2:48:16.300 --> 2:48:20.420
 Like I know if you're a downed pilot, you have to go and you have to do this training

2:48:20.420 --> 2:48:22.300
 and like it's, you'll get captured.

2:48:22.300 --> 2:48:27.920
 It's like this whole thing and they fuck with your brain, but there's a line.

2:48:27.920 --> 2:48:29.680
 There's a line.

2:48:29.680 --> 2:48:37.420
 My issue is go to the line, cross the line, give them the tools to come back from the

2:48:37.420 --> 2:48:38.420
 line.

2:48:38.420 --> 2:48:39.420
 Right.

2:48:39.420 --> 2:48:40.420
 Yeah.

2:48:40.420 --> 2:48:41.420
 We don't do that.

2:48:41.420 --> 2:48:43.400
 We don't, we, we know there's PTSD.

2:48:43.400 --> 2:48:44.980
 We know there's a, such a thing.

2:48:44.980 --> 2:48:46.540
 We understand there's anxiety and depression.

2:48:46.540 --> 2:48:48.140
 We understand there's major depressive disorder.

2:48:48.140 --> 2:48:51.140
 We understand that there are precursors.

2:48:51.140 --> 2:48:52.400
 There are signs and symptoms.

2:48:52.400 --> 2:48:54.340
 We understand that.

2:48:54.340 --> 2:49:00.860
 So why are we not building enough of a toolkit, whether that be, I'm not talking medication.

2:49:00.860 --> 2:49:06.260
 I'm talking, it sounds woo woo, but fucking trust me, it works.

2:49:06.260 --> 2:49:08.280
 I'm talking meditation.

2:49:08.280 --> 2:49:09.820
 I'm talking yoga.

2:49:09.820 --> 2:49:11.980
 I'm talking about peer group support.

2:49:11.980 --> 2:49:16.800
 I'm talking about if you go to your doctor and report this, there's, you're not automatically

2:49:16.800 --> 2:49:18.980
 going to be losing your job.

2:49:18.980 --> 2:49:22.340
 Why aren't we giving the proper tools and the education needed?

2:49:22.340 --> 2:49:24.760
 These things are not difficult to teach.

2:49:24.760 --> 2:49:26.100
 They don't take a lot of time.

2:49:26.100 --> 2:49:27.560
 They don't take a lot of money.

2:49:27.560 --> 2:49:30.440
 The only time it takes a lot of money is when you want to medicate.

2:49:30.440 --> 2:49:32.500
 We don't need to medicate you yet.

2:49:32.500 --> 2:49:35.820
 You only need to be medicated if you're a danger to someone else or yourself.

2:49:35.820 --> 2:49:39.440
 And most of the time, because of the way the system is set, you'll lie about it through

2:49:39.440 --> 2:49:42.660
 your fucking teeth, just so that no one touches you.

2:49:42.660 --> 2:49:47.620
 So from the perspective of the military, do you think you can still be a bad motherfucker

2:49:47.620 --> 2:49:50.060
 and do all the mental work?

2:49:50.060 --> 2:49:51.060
 Yes.

2:49:51.060 --> 2:49:55.820
 Some of the baddest dudes I've ever known are like, I gotta go to yoga.

2:49:55.820 --> 2:49:57.780
 I gotta go meditate.

2:49:57.780 --> 2:49:59.380
 I go do ayah with those guys.

2:49:59.380 --> 2:50:00.380
 Why?

2:50:00.380 --> 2:50:04.980
 Because they know that that's not okay to be like that in your life.

2:50:04.980 --> 2:50:10.140
 Can you answer the ridiculously big question of what is PTSD?

2:50:10.140 --> 2:50:13.860
 Do you understand the basic characteristics of it?

2:50:13.860 --> 2:50:20.500
 Is there universal characteristics from your own unique experience, from what you've understood

2:50:20.500 --> 2:50:21.500
 about it?

2:50:21.500 --> 2:50:22.500
 Yeah, of course there are.

2:50:22.500 --> 2:50:27.460
 So there's the basic things that a doctor looks for when they're diagnosing PTSD.

2:50:27.460 --> 2:50:28.460
 I'm not a doctor.

2:50:28.460 --> 2:50:30.100
 Let me make that fucking clear.

2:50:30.100 --> 2:50:32.320
 But there are things that you look for.

2:50:32.320 --> 2:50:34.060
 You look for insomnia.

2:50:34.060 --> 2:50:36.100
 You look for anger and aggression.

2:50:36.100 --> 2:50:38.260
 You look for people to fly off the handle.

2:50:38.260 --> 2:50:40.700
 You look for avoidance.

2:50:40.700 --> 2:50:42.820
 You can tell in somebody's body.

2:50:42.820 --> 2:50:43.820
 People who can't sleep.

2:50:43.820 --> 2:50:47.500
 If you can't sleep, you know that after a certain amount of time, they're just going

2:50:47.500 --> 2:50:49.540
 to deteriorate.

2:50:49.540 --> 2:50:51.540
 You know, sleeplessness, triggers.

2:50:51.540 --> 2:50:54.020
 When you say avoidance, do you mean...

2:50:54.020 --> 2:50:55.020
 Avoidance.

2:50:55.020 --> 2:50:58.980
 So like, when I first got back to Canada, I avoided everybody that was Middle Eastern

2:50:58.980 --> 2:51:03.320
 at all costs, no matter how much of a difference it made in my day.

2:51:03.320 --> 2:51:07.100
 If I had to not go somewhere for one of the greatest events of my life, I wouldn't have

2:51:07.100 --> 2:51:08.100
 went.

2:51:08.100 --> 2:51:11.540
 But isn't there some aspect that are combined with the triggers?

2:51:11.540 --> 2:51:16.060
 Maybe it's wise to avoid triggers even like for your own personal health, well being.

2:51:16.060 --> 2:51:17.060
 Well that's it.

2:51:17.060 --> 2:51:19.060
 For me, that was one of my triggers.

2:51:19.060 --> 2:51:20.740
 So you have triggers.

2:51:20.740 --> 2:51:24.500
 And then you also deal with things like sounds and smells.

2:51:24.500 --> 2:51:25.500
 You can tell.

2:51:25.500 --> 2:51:26.700
 You can tell when someone's triggered.

2:51:26.700 --> 2:51:28.660
 A lot of vets don't like fireworks.

2:51:28.660 --> 2:51:31.620
 It's like, okay, well remove yourself from the situation.

2:51:31.620 --> 2:51:39.620
 So there's other things within PTSD that kind of rear its head that with PTSD kind of attach

2:51:39.620 --> 2:51:40.620
 other things.

2:51:40.620 --> 2:51:43.580
 So like when I was diagnosed with PTSD, I think it was like four years later, I was

2:51:43.580 --> 2:51:46.200
 diagnosed with major depressive disorder.

2:51:46.200 --> 2:51:50.800
 And that was kind of a compilation of things that was just like a shit show there.

2:51:50.800 --> 2:51:52.300
 What is major depressive disorder?

2:51:52.300 --> 2:51:53.300
 Good question.

2:51:53.300 --> 2:51:56.060
 Is there an answer?

2:51:56.060 --> 2:51:57.060
 I don't have one.

2:51:57.060 --> 2:51:58.980
 I was told I had it.

2:51:58.980 --> 2:52:05.180
 Okay, so I mean, what does your mind go through?

2:52:05.180 --> 2:52:10.820
 Where are the places that my mind goes, your mind goes like the dark places when I get

2:52:10.820 --> 2:52:12.980
 triggered and when it was like really bad?

2:52:12.980 --> 2:52:13.980
 Yeah.

2:52:13.980 --> 2:52:14.980
 Okay.

2:52:14.980 --> 2:52:15.980
 Yeah.

2:52:15.980 --> 2:52:20.140
 So you thought about suicide every minute of every day.

2:52:20.140 --> 2:52:23.500
 What are the pros of suicide in your mind at that time?

2:52:23.500 --> 2:52:29.740
 At that time, the pros were no one has to deal with this anymore, I don't have to feel

2:52:29.740 --> 2:52:37.500
 this way anymore, I'm a burden to my family, I'm a burden to the military system, I'm weak,

2:52:37.500 --> 2:52:44.100
 I'm a bad soldier, I didn't do my job, I don't deserve to be alive, I don't deserve veterans

2:52:44.100 --> 2:52:49.740
 affairs support, my parents don't deserve to watch me go through this, the guy I was

2:52:49.740 --> 2:52:56.060
 dating didn't deserve to put up with the bullshit I put him through, the people who drive with

2:52:56.060 --> 2:53:02.980
 me in cars didn't deserve to almost hit medians because I swerved because of a piece of garbage,

2:53:02.980 --> 2:53:08.220
 people didn't deserve my racist outburst, people didn't deserve, people didn't, I did

2:53:08.220 --> 2:53:10.260
 not deserve to be breathing anymore.

2:53:10.260 --> 2:53:15.060
 I should have died there and I wished I died there.

2:53:15.060 --> 2:53:17.820
 So self hate there too.

2:53:17.820 --> 2:53:30.380
 So that's at the core of it, that's like this, so how do you escape from that place?

2:53:30.380 --> 2:53:39.420
 How do you overcome that depression essentially at the core of the desire to kill yourself?

2:53:39.420 --> 2:53:46.540
 What basic principles, I mean, we could talk about ayahuasca, but basic principles of literally

2:53:46.540 --> 2:53:48.380
 how do you escape that moment?

2:53:48.380 --> 2:53:53.460
 Yeah, previous to any of that, I did from 2009, I got out, so I was medically, I was

2:53:53.460 --> 2:54:00.100
 3B medical honorable discharge in 2011, May 23rd, 2011, so I left the military then.

2:54:00.100 --> 2:54:04.780
 And so it's been 10 years, just over 10 years, oh my God, it's 10 and a half years, I just

2:54:04.780 --> 2:54:05.780
 realized that right now.

2:54:05.780 --> 2:54:06.780
 Oh my God.

2:54:06.780 --> 2:54:07.780
 Happy anniversary.

2:54:07.780 --> 2:54:08.780
 Thanks, man.

2:54:08.780 --> 2:54:09.780
 Awesome.

2:54:09.780 --> 2:54:14.980
 So I've been out for 10 years and I would say the reason I didn't kill myself for the

2:54:14.980 --> 2:54:18.900
 longest time was the individual I was dating.

2:54:18.900 --> 2:54:22.260
 That was straight across the board, that was it.

2:54:22.260 --> 2:54:31.340
 For me, there was no relief for about six years of the thought of just kill yourself,

2:54:31.340 --> 2:54:32.340
 kill yourself, kill yourself.

2:54:32.340 --> 2:54:33.340
 It's easier if you just do it.

2:54:33.340 --> 2:54:36.780
 That voice was so strong for that long, there was really no relief.

2:54:36.780 --> 2:54:44.220
 What there was though was implementation of different medications, realizing they weren't

2:54:44.220 --> 2:54:49.540
 working, trying different things, getting myself to a point where I could leave my house

2:54:49.540 --> 2:54:54.980
 comfortably ish again, and I wasn't triggered, which then allowed me to travel, which then

2:54:54.980 --> 2:54:59.900
 allowed me to slowly try to go back to school, which by the way, it was a very bad idea.

2:54:59.900 --> 2:55:02.740
 That was a bad idea, that was bad.

2:55:02.740 --> 2:55:08.180
 I went too early, they started practicing active shooter drills in our school.

2:55:08.180 --> 2:55:11.700
 It was bad, my professors understood.

2:55:11.700 --> 2:55:14.100
 School was full of triggers, it turns out.

2:55:14.100 --> 2:55:16.980
 It is when you live in Vancouver.

2:55:16.980 --> 2:55:20.900
 There's a theme to this conversation about your love for Canada.

2:55:20.900 --> 2:55:25.940
 Look at me, I love my fucking country, I am one of the most patriotic people you will

2:55:25.940 --> 2:55:26.940
 meet in it.

2:55:26.940 --> 2:55:31.740
 I think Canada is one of the greatest fucking places on the earth.

2:55:31.740 --> 2:55:38.860
 I think in the past two years or three years, I have seen what I loved so deeply, so proudly

2:55:38.860 --> 2:55:50.380
 preached about so...

2:55:50.380 --> 2:55:55.060
 I'm so proud of what I did there.

2:55:55.060 --> 2:56:04.260
 And I'm so proud of the country I got to represent, because I was good at my job.

2:56:04.260 --> 2:56:08.940
 Being great at your job for a country you love, you just don't like some of the politicians

2:56:08.940 --> 2:56:09.940
 some of the time.

2:56:09.940 --> 2:56:14.620
 It's not even the politicians anymore, it's the state of the country.

2:56:14.620 --> 2:56:17.760
 I'm a second class citizen in my own country right now.

2:56:17.760 --> 2:56:21.220
 I can't travel to see my parents within my own country.

2:56:21.220 --> 2:56:24.740
 I'm not allowed to step foot in my son's school.

2:56:24.740 --> 2:56:29.100
 I am not allowed to go to a restaurant with my family.

2:56:29.100 --> 2:56:34.620
 I'm not allowed to leave Canada without, I told you all the stuff I have to do to get

2:56:34.620 --> 2:56:35.620
 here.

2:56:35.620 --> 2:56:38.300
 To even get home, I have to do the same.

2:56:38.300 --> 2:56:44.900
 I'm watched by the RCMP, neighbors rat you out.

2:56:44.900 --> 2:56:47.300
 So for somebody who fought for their country.

2:56:47.300 --> 2:56:50.100
 I hate it, it makes me so sad.

2:56:50.100 --> 2:56:56.060
 To go through this process of what many consider to be power overreach by government in the

2:56:56.060 --> 2:57:00.620
 face of this particular pandemic.

2:57:00.620 --> 2:57:05.140
 I always knew I had a hard time, I loved Canada, the day I got spit on when I got home was

2:57:05.140 --> 2:57:06.140
 not ideal.

2:57:06.140 --> 2:57:17.260
 But the thing was, I knew long enough that if I just put one foot in front of the other

2:57:17.260 --> 2:57:23.580
 and kept going to treatment, and kept doing what my doctor told me to do, that I could

2:57:23.580 --> 2:57:26.980
 pull out of this if I tried.

2:57:26.980 --> 2:57:29.820
 I was told that I could do anything in my life.

2:57:29.820 --> 2:57:31.460
 It didn't matter.

2:57:31.460 --> 2:57:32.980
 As long as I tried.

2:57:32.980 --> 2:57:36.100
 Was trying really hard?

2:57:36.100 --> 2:57:41.700
 Trying was harder than breathing.

2:57:41.700 --> 2:57:42.980
 It was exhausting.

2:57:42.980 --> 2:57:50.780
 It was, I would be awake for like half a day and every minute of that day, I'd just stare

2:57:50.780 --> 2:57:53.940
 at the wall and just want to kill myself.

2:57:53.940 --> 2:58:00.220
 That's what I've had people close to me who suffer from depression and it was like, it's

2:58:00.220 --> 2:58:06.180
 unclear how to escape, but it's clear that you need to try something.

2:58:06.180 --> 2:58:07.940
 And they didn't want to even try.

2:58:07.940 --> 2:58:10.940
 Because you have no try in you.

2:58:10.940 --> 2:58:18.340
 I'm watching a person who has no energy essentially to like do any of it and it's like so hopeless.

2:58:18.340 --> 2:58:23.260
 But you have to try and I think some of that has to do with all the different physical

2:58:23.260 --> 2:58:24.260
 feeds you have to do.

2:58:24.260 --> 2:58:27.380
 Like when you have nothing left, you still keep going.

2:58:27.380 --> 2:58:33.580
 That same like weird drive when you're empty, you still keep going.

2:58:33.580 --> 2:58:34.580
 I wanted to give up.

2:58:34.580 --> 2:58:35.580
 I tried.

2:58:35.580 --> 2:58:37.660
 It's, I did.

2:58:37.660 --> 2:58:42.900
 I'm really lucky because it really was the one person that I'd wake up to next every

2:58:42.900 --> 2:58:47.700
 day and he'd be like, hey, so that new drug you're on?

2:58:47.700 --> 2:58:51.220
 Fun fact, if you don't go to sleep right away, you talk and when you talk, you just don't

2:58:51.220 --> 2:58:56.580
 fucking stop and you go off about everything that's horrible and I'm like, what are you

2:58:56.580 --> 2:58:57.580
 talking about?

2:58:57.580 --> 2:58:58.580
 No, last night.

2:58:58.580 --> 2:58:59.580
 Yeah.

2:58:59.580 --> 2:59:00.580
 You took that pill.

2:59:00.580 --> 2:59:01.580
 Guess what?

2:59:01.580 --> 2:59:02.580
 You just, you just, you didn't stop.

2:59:02.580 --> 2:59:03.580
 I'm like, I have no recollection.

2:59:03.580 --> 2:59:04.580
 I'd get up in the middle of the night.

2:59:04.580 --> 2:59:11.580
 I would cook food like on a stove and it would be, hopefully we don't die because I would

2:59:11.580 --> 2:59:14.780
 have no recollection because of the drugs.

2:59:14.780 --> 2:59:21.060
 The idea that when people say, well, just put yourself out of depression, I'm a highly

2:59:21.060 --> 2:59:25.860
 motivated individual.

2:59:25.860 --> 2:59:32.620
 The idea of lifting my head up to turnover was daunting.

2:59:32.620 --> 2:59:33.620
 It's terrifying.

2:59:33.620 --> 2:59:39.340
 It's like for somebody so as driven as you to completely lose all of that for moments

2:59:39.340 --> 2:59:43.420
 of time, for stretches of time.

2:59:43.420 --> 2:59:45.100
 Fuck the mind is a motherfucker.

2:59:45.100 --> 2:59:46.100
 It is.

2:59:46.100 --> 2:59:54.260
 I can't, for somebody like, I can't, I can't, I'm so, I'm so grateful for people like you

2:59:54.260 --> 2:59:56.540
 to be able to pull out of that.

2:59:56.540 --> 2:59:58.980
 I've been always the opposite.

2:59:58.980 --> 3:00:06.460
 Like I've been very fortunate to just always find joy, meaning in everything, even the

3:00:06.460 --> 3:00:07.460
 stupidest shit.

3:00:07.460 --> 3:00:08.940
 Can I ask you something?

3:00:08.940 --> 3:00:09.940
 Yeah.

3:00:09.940 --> 3:00:16.020
 Do you think that's because of how you were raised, where you came from?

3:00:16.020 --> 3:00:19.340
 No, no, it was my own person.

3:00:19.340 --> 3:00:27.380
 I honestly think it's the biology, the, this, cause I had my parents, I'm very cognizant

3:00:27.380 --> 3:00:30.460
 of had nothing to do with that.

3:00:30.460 --> 3:00:33.460
 They, they never understood this little engine I had.

3:00:33.460 --> 3:00:37.740
 I just, I always liked just sitting, looking at people and just enjoying how amazing they

3:00:37.740 --> 3:00:42.500
 are and just like looking at, like it's, I think it's straight up just biology, whatever

3:00:42.500 --> 3:00:44.220
 the neurochemistry is.

3:00:44.220 --> 3:00:50.100
 Like I'm just getting like a good drug from, yeah, I'm getting hits all the time from stupid

3:00:50.100 --> 3:00:51.100
 shit.

3:00:51.100 --> 3:00:58.180
 And it doesn't, and yeah, so that's why I can be, sometimes I'll talk like very self

3:00:58.180 --> 3:01:03.420
 critically about myself because that's almost makes me, it makes life more fun and challenges

3:01:03.420 --> 3:01:05.180
 stuff and it makes you more productive.

3:01:05.180 --> 3:01:09.140
 But ultimately it's because I'm getting that like good, I'm getting the good stuff all

3:01:09.140 --> 3:01:10.140
 the time.

3:01:10.140 --> 3:01:11.140
 I wondered about that.

3:01:11.140 --> 3:01:14.340
 I was thinking about that when I listened to you for the first time on, I think when

3:01:14.340 --> 3:01:17.380
 you're on Rogan for the first time, water shouldn't do that.

3:01:17.380 --> 3:01:19.180
 Oh, it's not water.

3:01:19.180 --> 3:01:20.180
 You shouldn't trust.

3:01:20.180 --> 3:01:21.180
 See, this is the thing with the Russians.

3:01:21.180 --> 3:01:22.180
 It's Dessani.

3:01:22.180 --> 3:01:23.180
 It's owned by Coca Cola.

3:01:23.180 --> 3:01:26.140
 Well, no, I had it resealed.

3:01:26.140 --> 3:01:30.980
 I mean, I didn't go that far, but now I'm really certain to question what's in this,

3:01:30.980 --> 3:01:31.980
 but that's okay.

3:01:31.980 --> 3:01:34.500
 If I offered you tea, you should really be worried.

3:01:34.500 --> 3:01:35.500
 Yeah.

3:01:35.500 --> 3:01:36.500
 Why?

3:01:36.500 --> 3:01:41.740
 I mean, that's the, no, that's the, like the more famous way that Russians usually assassinate

3:01:41.740 --> 3:01:42.740
 it.

3:01:42.740 --> 3:01:43.740
 They put poison in the tea.

3:01:43.740 --> 3:01:49.420
 Cause a lot of Russians drink tea and you know, all right, well, I mean there is a blade

3:01:49.420 --> 3:01:50.420
 right there.

3:01:50.420 --> 3:01:54.580
 So I thought was somebody, um, Andrew Huberman gave that to me.

3:01:54.580 --> 3:01:55.580
 He's also good.

3:01:55.580 --> 3:01:58.700
 I don't know if you know him, but he's a cool, I don't know all the people, you know, I'm

3:01:58.700 --> 3:01:59.700
 new.

3:01:59.700 --> 3:02:00.700
 Okay.

3:02:00.700 --> 3:02:01.700
 I'm new here, Lex.

3:02:01.700 --> 3:02:02.700
 You're going to have to send instructions.

3:02:02.700 --> 3:02:03.700
 Yeah.

3:02:03.700 --> 3:02:06.540
 I'm going to have to let my friends say, he says, uh, he's an ex operator and he'll message

3:02:06.540 --> 3:02:08.820
 me once in a while and ask me something and I'll answer back.

3:02:08.820 --> 3:02:14.060
 If I answer in the correct way, he'll go candidate meets expectations.

3:02:14.060 --> 3:02:15.340
 I'm like, fuck you.

3:02:15.340 --> 3:02:16.780
 I'm not a candidate of anything.

3:02:16.780 --> 3:02:17.780
 Yeah.

3:02:17.780 --> 3:02:18.780
 Yeah.

3:02:18.780 --> 3:02:19.780
 But yeah, it's essentially.

3:02:19.780 --> 3:02:21.500
 Well, Andrew Huberman is kind of a celebrity.

3:02:21.500 --> 3:02:23.340
 Andrew, you should check her out.

3:02:23.340 --> 3:02:25.140
 Uh, you're, you're an interesting person.

3:02:25.140 --> 3:02:26.140
 You guys should connect.

3:02:26.140 --> 3:02:32.300
 He's a Stanford neuroscientist was a, I think the number one podcast in the world in health.

3:02:32.300 --> 3:02:37.140
 Uh, he's a, does he have like a, a beard thing going?

3:02:37.140 --> 3:02:38.140
 Uh, yeah.

3:02:38.140 --> 3:02:42.500
 I mean, I'm knocking him down to like, does he have a beard?

3:02:42.500 --> 3:02:45.300
 I don't, I don't look, I don't look at people's visual appearance, man.

3:02:45.300 --> 3:02:46.300
 No, I don't.

3:02:46.300 --> 3:02:47.580
 Uh, does he have a beard?

3:02:47.580 --> 3:02:48.580
 I think he has a beard.

3:02:48.580 --> 3:02:49.580
 Yeah.

3:02:49.580 --> 3:02:54.020
 He's a very handsome gentleman.

3:02:54.020 --> 3:02:56.540
 I think I know you're talking about, cause I think I was looking at his stuff this morning.

3:02:56.540 --> 3:02:57.540
 Yeah, exactly.

3:02:57.540 --> 3:02:58.540
 No, seriously on Instagram.

3:02:58.540 --> 3:02:59.540
 No, no, no.

3:02:59.540 --> 3:03:00.540
 Okay.

3:03:00.540 --> 3:03:01.540
 Yeah.

3:03:01.540 --> 3:03:02.540
 I know him.

3:03:02.540 --> 3:03:04.260
 But it's very, very humble, very intelligent.

3:03:04.260 --> 3:03:05.260
 Yeah.

3:03:05.260 --> 3:03:09.180
 Probably you would understand, like I'm very kind of poetic and so on.

3:03:09.180 --> 3:03:16.660
 He's, he's probably the most like rigorous, um, reference machine of science.

3:03:16.660 --> 3:03:18.140
 Like he's a legit scientist.

3:03:18.140 --> 3:03:22.100
 Like he knows every paper and everything has to do with the mind and neuroscience.

3:03:22.100 --> 3:03:23.100
 Like performance.

3:03:23.100 --> 3:03:24.100
 Yeah.

3:03:24.100 --> 3:03:25.100
 Yeah.

3:03:25.100 --> 3:03:31.140
 He's much more, he's, he's, he's much more actually, and the focus is always on, um,

3:03:31.140 --> 3:03:34.500
 how to help, how that helps people.

3:03:34.500 --> 3:03:38.420
 So like protocols, like, like here's what you need to do to get better sleep.

3:03:38.420 --> 3:03:39.420
 Yes.

3:03:39.420 --> 3:03:40.420
 Yes, I know who it is.

3:03:40.420 --> 3:03:41.420
 Here's like a thousand papers.

3:03:41.420 --> 3:03:42.420
 Yeah.

3:03:42.420 --> 3:03:44.260
 And he just goes like hammers nonstop.

3:03:44.260 --> 3:03:51.700
 I mean, he, um, he spent a week in Austin, he's coming back and spending, uh, a couple

3:03:51.700 --> 3:03:52.700
 of weeks in Austin.

3:03:52.700 --> 3:03:53.700
 We just hang out.

3:03:53.700 --> 3:03:58.420
 And it's like, you think that was like a teleprompter or something, like the way he does his podcast.

3:03:58.420 --> 3:03:59.420
 Yeah.

3:03:59.420 --> 3:04:05.340
 Like in person, he's the same, like, all right, this is, this is intense, but I like it.

3:04:05.340 --> 3:04:06.340
 Anyway.

3:04:06.340 --> 3:04:07.340
 Anyway.

3:04:07.340 --> 3:04:08.820
 Uh, why did we bring him up?

3:04:08.820 --> 3:04:09.820
 I don't know.

3:04:09.820 --> 3:04:10.820
 Brought up knives.

3:04:10.820 --> 3:04:11.820
 We were talking about.

3:04:11.820 --> 3:04:12.820
 He gave it to me.

3:04:12.820 --> 3:04:13.820
 That's right.

3:04:13.820 --> 3:04:14.820
 PTSD.

3:04:14.820 --> 3:04:15.820
 Yeah.

3:04:15.820 --> 3:04:16.820
 And then you talk about poison and how you were poisoning me.

3:04:16.820 --> 3:04:17.820
 And I said, knives.

3:04:17.820 --> 3:04:18.820
 We're talking about Russians.

3:04:18.820 --> 3:04:21.260
 And then we were kind of talking about the brain and PTSD.

3:04:21.260 --> 3:04:22.260
 Yeah.

3:04:22.260 --> 3:04:27.900
 I think for, for most people though, the biggest thing when they see somebody who's struggling

3:04:27.900 --> 3:04:32.020
 with PTSD there, their first, you know, reaction is how do I help them?

3:04:32.020 --> 3:04:36.860
 Well, often just saying, Hey, I'm here when you're ready to talk and you're going through

3:04:36.860 --> 3:04:39.740
 something, whether you want to talk about it right now or not, I'm here.

3:04:39.740 --> 3:04:42.620
 And then keeping a close eye on behaviors.

3:04:42.620 --> 3:04:49.420
 When you start to see somebody having, you know, four, five, six beers at night, let's

3:04:49.420 --> 3:04:50.420
 ask why.

3:04:50.420 --> 3:04:52.460
 When you see somebody, you can tell they're not sleeping.

3:04:52.460 --> 3:04:53.460
 Hey buddy, you sleeping?

3:04:53.460 --> 3:04:54.460
 I just am not sleeping.

3:04:54.460 --> 3:04:58.260
 Instead of just going, Oh, that sucks.

3:04:58.260 --> 3:05:00.340
 Hey, why aren't you sleeping?

3:05:00.340 --> 3:05:01.340
 You having nightmares?

3:05:01.340 --> 3:05:03.860
 Are you, you just have an insomnia?

3:05:03.860 --> 3:05:05.700
 Are you just eating sugar before bed?

3:05:05.700 --> 3:05:10.700
 Like care enough about your people to just ask one followup question.

3:05:10.700 --> 3:05:12.780
 Cause often that's really all it takes.

3:05:12.780 --> 3:05:18.060
 Cause then somebody goes, somebody cares enough to ask and then they'll just, yeah.

3:05:18.060 --> 3:05:20.060
 Just showing that you care.

3:05:20.060 --> 3:05:22.540
 Honestly, grocery store lineup.

3:05:22.540 --> 3:05:24.580
 I'll say, Oh, I like your dress.

3:05:24.580 --> 3:05:25.580
 Oh, thank you.

3:05:25.580 --> 3:05:27.060
 And then I'll go, how's your day going?

3:05:27.060 --> 3:05:30.380
 They're like, actually it's going all right.

3:05:30.380 --> 3:05:33.100
 It's not as great as I thought it would be today, but I'm doing okay.

3:05:33.100 --> 3:05:36.660
 But like they'll give you a, instead of good you, instead of just giving you this fake,

3:05:36.660 --> 3:05:37.660
 false reaction.

3:05:37.660 --> 3:05:44.100
 If you just show any effort in somebody that you care at all about someone's wellbeing,

3:05:44.100 --> 3:05:45.100
 you'd be amazed.

3:05:45.100 --> 3:05:46.100
 Amazed.

3:05:46.100 --> 3:05:49.100
 And some of that is just energy.

3:05:49.100 --> 3:05:54.980
 The reason honestly I moved to Austin is some lady at a Walmart said, honey, you look handsome

3:05:54.980 --> 3:05:55.980
 in that suit.

3:05:55.980 --> 3:06:01.700
 But the care that she put in that, she just looked at me and it wasn't like hitting at

3:06:01.700 --> 3:06:02.700
 me or something.

3:06:02.700 --> 3:06:03.700
 She was like, the love.

3:06:03.700 --> 3:06:04.700
 Just love.

3:06:04.700 --> 3:06:05.700
 Yeah.

3:06:05.700 --> 3:06:06.700
 And I was like, Oh, okay.

3:06:06.700 --> 3:06:07.700
 I'm moving here.

3:06:07.700 --> 3:06:08.700
 I guess.

3:06:08.700 --> 3:06:09.700
 There was a, that's so funny you said that.

3:06:09.700 --> 3:06:13.720
 Cause I told my, I told my husband this happened and it was, it threw me off.

3:06:13.720 --> 3:06:18.700
 There was an older lady at a store and this was right after we, we got a brief period

3:06:18.700 --> 3:06:20.500
 of no masks in Canada.

3:06:20.500 --> 3:06:21.500
 Just like a brief.

3:06:21.500 --> 3:06:22.500
 It's like five minutes.

3:06:22.500 --> 3:06:23.500
 Oh yeah.

3:06:23.500 --> 3:06:24.500
 It was not even that.

3:06:24.500 --> 3:06:26.760
 And I, I had come from like an interview or something.

3:06:26.760 --> 3:06:30.140
 So I had actually had makeup on that day and I had my hat and I was, you know, just at

3:06:30.140 --> 3:06:31.200
 the grocery store.

3:06:31.200 --> 3:06:34.260
 She walked up to me and she got real close and I didn't know what was happening.

3:06:34.260 --> 3:06:37.880
 And then she got closer and then she just grabbed my arm like this.

3:06:37.880 --> 3:06:40.600
 She goes, I love that hat on you.

3:06:40.600 --> 3:06:43.860
 And I looked at her and I was like, she touched me during a pandemic and she's old.

3:06:43.860 --> 3:06:45.180
 Oh my God, I love you too.

3:06:45.180 --> 3:06:46.180
 Thank you so much.

3:06:46.180 --> 3:06:47.180
 I said, you're so amazing.

3:06:47.180 --> 3:06:49.100
 And I just, and I just sparked a conversation.

3:06:49.100 --> 3:06:50.100
 Yeah.

3:06:50.100 --> 3:06:51.100
 Yeah.

3:06:51.100 --> 3:06:52.100
 That's amazing.

3:06:52.100 --> 3:06:53.100
 Doesn't take much.

3:06:53.100 --> 3:06:54.100
 Yeah.

3:06:54.100 --> 3:06:55.100
 That little moment of genuine care.

3:06:55.100 --> 3:07:01.780
 Maybe you can tell me actually the, um, the journey you took with ayahuasca, like what

3:07:01.780 --> 3:07:03.040
 that's such a fascinating journey.

3:07:03.040 --> 3:07:08.740
 So like, uh, letting your mind go to different places in order to rediscover itself, like,

3:07:08.740 --> 3:07:13.580
 like, what is it like a rocket ship to somewhere else so you can land in a better place?

3:07:13.580 --> 3:07:16.740
 Here, how about I show you something that'll help your brain.

3:07:16.740 --> 3:07:17.740
 Yes.

3:07:17.740 --> 3:07:21.100
 This is not for you to lift up either and show on the camera because there's leaves

3:07:21.100 --> 3:07:22.100
 in it.

3:07:22.100 --> 3:07:23.100
 Like there's leaves in some pages.

3:07:23.100 --> 3:07:25.980
 So just don't dump it out cause it'll go all fucking everywhere.

3:07:25.980 --> 3:07:26.980
 Got it.

3:07:26.980 --> 3:07:27.980
 Got it.

3:07:27.980 --> 3:07:28.980
 Instructions.

3:07:28.980 --> 3:07:29.980
 I like this.

3:07:29.980 --> 3:07:30.980
 Yeah.

3:07:30.980 --> 3:07:31.980
 Well, you feel like you need them.

3:07:31.980 --> 3:07:39.500
 Um, ayahuasca is a beautiful psychedelic that we have been so blessed to have on this earth

3:07:39.500 --> 3:07:45.740
 that we have so underutilized and could be, I don't want to say saving humanity, but just

3:07:45.740 --> 3:07:48.700
 you ever hear that saying, if you could just give everyone mushrooms one time, the world

3:07:48.700 --> 3:07:50.300
 would be a better place.

3:07:50.300 --> 3:07:51.300
 Okay.

3:07:51.300 --> 3:07:57.580
 So psilocybin is I use for microdosing, uh, for depression.

3:07:57.580 --> 3:08:00.580
 I did ayahuasca in January of this year.

3:08:00.580 --> 3:08:06.380
 Um, and I've at that point, that was the last time I was on a pharmaceutical drug.

3:08:06.380 --> 3:08:09.940
 I've been off everything ever since 10 different ones.

3:08:09.940 --> 3:08:14.540
 So if you backtrack a little bit, just to, so you'll understand my doctor gave me the

3:08:14.540 --> 3:08:17.740
 opportunity, Dr. Greg Passi.

3:08:17.740 --> 3:08:20.980
 He is a veteran himself, served in Bosnia and Rwanda.

3:08:20.980 --> 3:08:21.980
 He's a medic.

3:08:21.980 --> 3:08:22.980
 He's a Colonel.

3:08:22.980 --> 3:08:25.280
 I think Colonel Lieutenant, he's going to fucking punch me right in the face for that.

3:08:25.280 --> 3:08:26.780
 He's high up officer.

3:08:26.780 --> 3:08:29.380
 Um, he is one of my saviors.

3:08:29.380 --> 3:08:31.220
 He's like my old, I call him my old man.

3:08:31.220 --> 3:08:35.340
 He's my favorite and, um, rides a Harley, like that kind of guy.

3:08:35.340 --> 3:08:36.340
 Nice.

3:08:36.340 --> 3:08:37.340
 Yeah.

3:08:37.340 --> 3:08:41.300
 And, um, he said, you know, Kels, this is, I just don't, I was hitting a wall.

3:08:41.300 --> 3:08:42.300
 I wasn't getting any better.

3:08:42.300 --> 3:08:45.140
 And he goes, what, how do you feel about cannabis?

3:08:45.140 --> 3:08:51.380
 And I was like, I don't feel good about it because family histories or my parents always

3:08:51.380 --> 3:08:55.580
 told me if I smoked weed, you know, it's just this, this perception because I just want

3:08:55.580 --> 3:08:56.700
 you to try it.

3:08:56.700 --> 3:08:58.420
 Just would it, would you be willing to try it?

3:08:58.420 --> 3:09:01.580
 So I was like, okay, so I was willing to try it.

3:09:01.580 --> 3:09:06.420
 Then I started going to these groups called Women Grow and, um, learning about it.

3:09:06.420 --> 3:09:12.620
 And then I realized, oh, I'm starting to sleep a little bit.

3:09:12.620 --> 3:09:14.780
 I don't feel groggy in the morning.

3:09:14.780 --> 3:09:16.620
 I don't feel like a bag of shit.

3:09:16.620 --> 3:09:21.060
 And I also want to have a baby one day and I can't have all this stuff in my system.

3:09:21.060 --> 3:09:27.700
 So I started using cannabis and then I started using it as a main medication and I'd been

3:09:27.700 --> 3:09:38.980
 using it now since 2014, got married, 2015, 2015, 2015 I started using it.

3:09:38.980 --> 3:09:41.060
 And then I've been using it ever since.

3:09:41.060 --> 3:09:46.460
 And that was the way I got off of all the pharmaceutical drugs was keeping cannabis

3:09:46.460 --> 3:09:51.700
 the constant, finding the right strains for me, and then slowly with the doctor's advice

3:09:51.700 --> 3:09:56.380
 and under supervision going off of those medications.

3:09:56.380 --> 3:10:01.900
 Back to January of 2021, I had hit a really bad spell last year.

3:10:01.900 --> 3:10:04.660
 Um, and the year before it was a really big struggle.

3:10:04.660 --> 3:10:09.380
 Uh, I almost lost my company last year due to COVID just like many, many millions of

3:10:09.380 --> 3:10:10.860
 people did.

3:10:10.860 --> 3:10:17.740
 Um, and instead of me just laying down and taking it, I pivoted really quickly and called

3:10:17.740 --> 3:10:19.380
 the factory and said, do you guys make masks?

3:10:19.380 --> 3:10:21.100
 They're like, yeah, we're making masks.

3:10:21.100 --> 3:10:23.980
 I was like, I'm going to call the Canadian government.

3:10:23.980 --> 3:10:27.620
 I'm going to get my medical license and I'm going to try to sell the masks and see if

3:10:27.620 --> 3:10:28.620
 we can do that.

3:10:28.620 --> 3:10:29.620
 And so we did that.

3:10:29.620 --> 3:10:37.860
 And so we did 200,000 masks for Ontario hospitals, um, which ironically went to my entire community

3:10:37.860 --> 3:10:39.860
 I was born and raised in.

3:10:39.860 --> 3:10:41.740
 So it was really weird.

3:10:41.740 --> 3:10:43.740
 And that kept us afloat long enough.

3:10:43.740 --> 3:10:49.260
 Um, we lost 200 retail locations that I all single handedly spent five years going like

3:10:49.260 --> 3:10:50.740
 door to door getting myself.

3:10:50.740 --> 3:10:51.740
 Um,

3:10:51.740 --> 3:10:54.940
 and we should say this is brass and unity, jewelry,

3:10:54.940 --> 3:10:57.220
 the jewelry and sunglass company.

3:10:57.220 --> 3:10:58.220
 And um, I started,

3:10:58.220 --> 3:10:59.220
 speaking of which,

3:10:59.220 --> 3:11:02.220
 looks like a cereal.

3:11:02.220 --> 3:11:05.020
 I mean, you do look good in them.

3:11:05.020 --> 3:11:06.020
 I won't lie to you.

3:11:06.020 --> 3:11:07.020
 Thank you.

3:11:07.020 --> 3:11:08.020
 Well, okay.

3:11:08.020 --> 3:11:09.020
 We'll call them the Lex.

3:11:09.020 --> 3:11:10.020
 That's those are now called the Lex.

3:11:10.020 --> 3:11:11.020
 Fuck the gunner.

3:11:11.020 --> 3:11:12.020
 They're the Lex.

3:11:12.020 --> 3:11:13.020
 I like it.

3:11:13.020 --> 3:11:14.020
 The Lex.

3:11:14.020 --> 3:11:15.020
 I'm jumping around here, but just bear with me.

3:11:15.020 --> 3:11:16.020
 I, I started, my doctor suggested art therapy.

3:11:16.020 --> 3:11:17.220
 Dr. Patsy did.

3:11:17.220 --> 3:11:19.140
 And that's really how the company started.

3:11:19.140 --> 3:11:23.140
 I bought beads and a pipe cutter and a hammer and a drill and I fucked up our kitchen table

3:11:23.140 --> 3:11:26.860
 and I taught myself how to put jewelry cause my husband was like, you can do it.

3:11:26.860 --> 3:11:27.860
 Go for it.

3:11:27.860 --> 3:11:31.020
 So I was like, okay, he says I can believes in me, so I guess I can do it.

3:11:31.020 --> 3:11:32.980
 No idea what I'm doing.

3:11:32.980 --> 3:11:38.060
 And then got to this point, um, you know, where COVID hit and people lost companies

3:11:38.060 --> 3:11:40.900
 and we pivoted and we did what we could.

3:11:40.900 --> 3:11:45.420
 And then I really started to go downhill psychologically.

3:11:45.420 --> 3:11:49.020
 I've found purpose again with this company.

3:11:49.020 --> 3:11:51.260
 I found a way to help again.

3:11:51.260 --> 3:11:54.700
 I found myself again.

3:11:54.700 --> 3:11:58.560
 And then that was in danger of being gone again.

3:11:58.560 --> 3:12:01.140
 So the company is 2015.

3:12:01.140 --> 3:12:06.300
 We started, I started building jewelry in 2015 under like a just, it was called her

3:12:06.300 --> 3:12:11.500
 wearables and it was really small and it was just, I was just trying to make stuff.

3:12:11.500 --> 3:12:13.220
 It wasn't supposed to be a company.

3:12:13.220 --> 3:12:17.940
 And you were on a ton of medication throughout this whole process.

3:12:17.940 --> 3:12:23.540
 And my mom being the tenacious truck driver she is, she was driving for Kevin Hart's what

3:12:23.540 --> 3:12:25.140
 now tour.

3:12:25.140 --> 3:12:29.540
 And so she got, she just harassed them was like, you need to meet my daughter.

3:12:29.540 --> 3:12:30.540
 Yeah.

3:12:30.540 --> 3:12:32.540
 I saw the picture of you and Kevin Hart, that's cool.

3:12:32.540 --> 3:12:33.940
 But he just gave me a good piece of advice.

3:12:33.940 --> 3:12:36.980
 Hey, if you're going to make this something, you can't really, if you want it to be for

3:12:36.980 --> 3:12:38.460
 everyone, you can't call it her wearables.

3:12:38.460 --> 3:12:39.900
 I was like, cool.

3:12:39.900 --> 3:12:44.220
 And then we drove home that night and then he tweeted it out to people to 24 million

3:12:44.220 --> 3:12:45.220
 people.

3:12:45.220 --> 3:12:47.980
 And he was like, who is now?

3:12:47.980 --> 3:12:49.620
 And that was a giant deal.

3:12:49.620 --> 3:12:52.500
 And then my husband kind of looked at me and being, he's so fucking brilliant.

3:12:52.500 --> 3:12:55.040
 He looked at me and goes, all right, yeah, we got to come up with a rename.

3:12:55.040 --> 3:12:56.040
 Let me start thinking.

3:12:56.040 --> 3:12:57.040
 Let me start brainstorming.

3:12:57.040 --> 3:12:58.340
 Like, let's make, you want to make this real?

3:12:58.340 --> 3:12:59.340
 Let's make this real.

3:12:59.340 --> 3:13:01.200
 And so we did.

3:13:01.200 --> 3:13:04.580
 And he was like, what do you think about like, we were doing like brass collective co, brass

3:13:04.580 --> 3:13:07.420
 this, but I just knew I wanted brass in the name.

3:13:07.420 --> 3:13:08.560
 And then he's like, what about brass and unity?

3:13:08.560 --> 3:13:09.780
 You're trying to like unify people.

3:13:09.780 --> 3:13:10.780
 Like why wouldn't you do that?

3:13:10.780 --> 3:13:13.460
 I'm like, fucking million horses came up with it.

3:13:13.460 --> 3:13:14.460
 Like everything else.

3:13:14.460 --> 3:13:15.460
 That's a great name.

3:13:15.460 --> 3:13:16.460
 Well, he's a brilliant person.

3:13:16.460 --> 3:13:17.460
 It's annoying.

3:13:17.460 --> 3:13:18.460
 Yeah.

3:13:18.460 --> 3:13:22.220
 So the idea of losing this thing that we had just built and just got me kind of functioning

3:13:22.220 --> 3:13:24.860
 with was devastating.

3:13:24.860 --> 3:13:29.780
 So I got this opportunity given to me by Griff, Combat Flip Flops.

3:13:29.780 --> 3:13:34.340
 Um, again, Brady, my husband was like, Hey, you should get sponsors for your podcast.

3:13:34.340 --> 3:13:37.020
 Hey, have you heard of this company, Combat Flip Flops?

3:13:37.020 --> 3:13:38.900
 Remember we watched them on Shark Tank.

3:13:38.900 --> 3:13:40.980
 And then I reached out, he emailed me back.

3:13:40.980 --> 3:13:43.860
 He's like, yeah, we go to together like peanut butter and jelly are companies.

3:13:43.860 --> 3:13:45.460
 That sounds great.

3:13:45.460 --> 3:13:49.700
 And then I was like, Hey, also, like, do you think one of your owners would want to come

3:13:49.700 --> 3:13:50.820
 on the podcast?

3:13:50.820 --> 3:13:54.340
 Just like tossing it out there kind of like I did with you.

3:13:54.340 --> 3:13:56.420
 And he was like, yeah, I'd love to come on.

3:13:56.420 --> 3:13:59.060
 And I was like, oh my God.

3:13:59.060 --> 3:14:01.140
 And he came on the podcast and it went great.

3:14:01.140 --> 3:14:04.620
 And then at the end of it, we stopped recording and he just kind of did this thing.

3:14:04.620 --> 3:14:05.620
 He does this.

3:14:05.620 --> 3:14:11.020
 Just like leans in real close, looks into your soul and goes, how you doing?

3:14:11.020 --> 3:14:12.020
 And they're like, great.

3:14:12.020 --> 3:14:14.020
 And he's like, how you really doing?

3:14:14.020 --> 3:14:16.020
 And I'm like, I'm horrible.

3:14:16.020 --> 3:14:18.020
 I've done everything.

3:14:18.020 --> 3:14:22.980
 And just this whole, just like waterworks happen and he goes, listen, have you ever

3:14:22.980 --> 3:14:23.980
 heard of Ayahuasca?

3:14:23.980 --> 3:14:29.260
 And I was like, yeah, like in movies and like psychedelics in the seventies, you know, and

3:14:29.260 --> 3:14:30.500
 he's like, no, no, no, no, no.

3:14:30.500 --> 3:14:31.500
 Let's like have a talk.

3:14:31.500 --> 3:14:34.020
 And he goes, I've got an opportunity for a spot.

3:14:34.020 --> 3:14:37.140
 I'm going with this charity called Heroic Hearts.

3:14:37.140 --> 3:14:41.700
 They have spaces in UK, Canada and the United States.

3:14:41.700 --> 3:14:44.100
 They're owned by an army ranger named Jesse Gould.

3:14:44.100 --> 3:14:47.900
 You know, they're really trying to help vets.

3:14:47.900 --> 3:14:48.900
 And this has worked.

3:14:48.900 --> 3:14:49.900
 Would you want to come?

3:14:49.900 --> 3:14:53.780
 And before he even said, like, would you, before I even got like an invite, I was like,

3:14:53.780 --> 3:14:54.780
 can I come?

3:14:54.780 --> 3:14:57.900
 When can I, when, when, when do we, when do we go?

3:14:57.900 --> 3:14:59.940
 And he's like, oh, it's in like three weeks.

3:14:59.940 --> 3:15:02.460
 You can't be on any SSRIs.

3:15:02.460 --> 3:15:04.060
 If you're on any, you're going to have to wean off.

3:15:04.060 --> 3:15:06.620
 And at the time I was on my last one.

3:15:06.620 --> 3:15:10.340
 And so I was like, I called my doctor and I was like, listen.

3:15:10.340 --> 3:15:11.820
 And he was like, what?

3:15:11.820 --> 3:15:13.700
 And I was like, guess what I'm about to do?

3:15:13.700 --> 3:15:16.340
 And he's like, I'm like going to go do ayahuasca.

3:15:16.340 --> 3:15:23.420
 And he goes, you're going to, he does this thing where he just goes, all right.

3:15:23.420 --> 3:15:24.900
 Because he knows he's not going to win.

3:15:24.900 --> 3:15:26.300
 He knows I'll just fight him on it.

3:15:26.300 --> 3:15:30.900
 That's just called that, like the, the Jocko reset because he does a.

3:15:30.900 --> 3:15:31.900
 Pretty much.

3:15:31.900 --> 3:15:32.900
 Yeah, exactly.

3:15:32.900 --> 3:15:35.260
 And he goes, I said, but here's the kicker.

3:15:35.260 --> 3:15:36.620
 I have to go off of this medication.

3:15:36.620 --> 3:15:40.580
 And he goes, well, you know, we're supposed to do that in the summer months when the depression's

3:15:40.580 --> 3:15:42.580
 not like bringing, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

3:15:42.580 --> 3:15:46.020
 Listen, I hear you, but I'm doing it.

3:15:46.020 --> 3:15:47.020
 Whether you want me to or not.

3:15:47.020 --> 3:15:50.020
 So I'm letting you know, Hey, this is going to happen.

3:15:50.020 --> 3:15:51.860
 And he's like, okay, just try to do it properly.

3:15:51.860 --> 3:15:52.860
 I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:15:52.860 --> 3:15:53.860
 I know the drill.

3:15:53.860 --> 3:15:54.860
 I know the drill, whatever, whatever.

3:15:54.860 --> 3:15:55.860
 I went to school to be a paramedic.

3:15:55.860 --> 3:15:56.860
 I know the drill.

3:15:56.860 --> 3:15:57.860
 I'll go off of it properly.

3:15:57.860 --> 3:16:02.180
 So I can like drop that within a week that stuff was, I was done taking it.

3:16:02.180 --> 3:16:06.260
 And I was going through like the world's worst just withdrawals.

3:16:06.260 --> 3:16:10.860
 It was like you were at a rock concert and your head was banging up and down, but you

3:16:10.860 --> 3:16:13.180
 were sitting perfectly still.

3:16:13.180 --> 3:16:14.180
 It was horrible.

3:16:14.180 --> 3:16:17.740
 But you had like a thing to look forward to with the sidewall.

3:16:17.740 --> 3:16:22.940
 I had a light at the end of the tunnel and I knew if I got to the light was the worst

3:16:22.940 --> 3:16:23.940
 that's going to happen.

3:16:23.940 --> 3:16:24.940
 Just get to the light.

3:16:24.940 --> 3:16:29.500
 But at that point, like I, again, I had a son, I had a husband, I had a great company,

3:16:29.500 --> 3:16:33.460
 I have a great house, I have a nice car, I have everything.

3:16:33.460 --> 3:16:36.780
 Why did I want to die every minute of the day?

3:16:36.780 --> 3:16:38.820
 I was at that point again.

3:16:38.820 --> 3:16:41.340
 And I'm like, this has got it, something's got to give.

3:16:41.340 --> 3:17:02.580
 And so I went and I got there and she is the most intense, beautiful, divine deity or entity

3:17:02.580 --> 3:17:11.620
 or visualization, whatever you want to deem ayahuasca as, mama ayahuasca is real.

3:17:11.620 --> 3:17:15.060
 And she takes no prisoners.

3:17:15.060 --> 3:17:23.500
 She shows you exactly what you need to see to help yourself, but she does not discriminate

3:17:23.500 --> 3:17:26.340
 against whether you're ready or not.

3:17:26.340 --> 3:17:30.640
 If you've ingested it, she's coming for you.

3:17:30.640 --> 3:17:34.600
 She's going to be either gentle or she's going to beat your ass.

3:17:34.600 --> 3:17:43.220
 And sometimes that's what you need, but she does it in a way that is profound.

3:17:43.220 --> 3:17:46.940
 So what were some memorable, profound moments for you?

3:17:46.940 --> 3:17:52.180
 What what are the places it took you, these people had you meet?

3:17:52.180 --> 3:17:58.180
 For the first time, I got to be in a group of people who didn't judge me or question

3:17:58.180 --> 3:17:59.360
 my service.

3:17:59.360 --> 3:18:01.420
 They just respect me.

3:18:01.420 --> 3:18:03.060
 That was number one.

3:18:03.060 --> 3:18:09.240
 So that group I lost, I just found again.

3:18:09.240 --> 3:18:12.420
 Big shocker, I was the only woman there again.

3:18:12.420 --> 3:18:16.020
 Seems to be the thing for me.

3:18:16.020 --> 3:18:18.660
 And so I was surrounded by all these special operators.

3:18:18.660 --> 3:18:20.020
 These aren't like normal soldiers.

3:18:20.020 --> 3:18:28.220
 These guys that I'm with are like, Bronze Star, fucking Purple Heart, just the coolest

3:18:28.220 --> 3:18:29.820
 people.

3:18:29.820 --> 3:18:32.200
 People I've always wanted to be like, that's my buddy.

3:18:32.200 --> 3:18:36.640
 Now I can be like, those are my buddies, like those motherfuckers will go to bat for me.

3:18:36.640 --> 3:18:38.140
 They will bend over backwards.

3:18:38.140 --> 3:18:40.060
 They will exfil me out of anywhere.

3:18:40.060 --> 3:18:42.700
 They will take a bullet for me.

3:18:42.700 --> 3:18:45.880
 And these guys welcomed me in in a way I didn't I didn't expect.

3:18:45.880 --> 3:18:48.160
 So that hit me weird right off the get.

3:18:48.160 --> 3:18:49.160
 I was nervous.

3:18:49.160 --> 3:18:52.160
 And now I was just felt that home for a minute.

3:18:52.160 --> 3:18:59.600
 And then when I stepped into ceremony, the first night because you do you do three nights

3:18:59.600 --> 3:19:06.560
 over like over like Friday, Saturday, Sunday, the first night, I was so nervous and so anxious

3:19:06.560 --> 3:19:12.020
 because you go up in ceremony and you're the shamans come in and they cleanse themselves

3:19:12.020 --> 3:19:18.300
 and then you get served the ayah individually, you go up, they give it to you, you can take

3:19:18.300 --> 3:19:21.420
 your time and pray, you can do whatever you want, then you drink it.

3:19:21.420 --> 3:19:29.160
 I was so just like, I got back to my mat and I sat there and I was like trying to keep

3:19:29.160 --> 3:19:30.160
 it in.

3:19:30.160 --> 3:19:34.000
 But I could feel that like heat come from my toes all the way up and you're like your

3:19:34.000 --> 3:19:35.000
 mouth starts to water.

3:19:35.000 --> 3:19:37.200
 I'm gonna throw up, I'm gonna throw up, I'm gonna throw up.

3:19:37.200 --> 3:19:45.560
 And I looked over to Griff and I looked at Bishop and I was like, okay, and you can't

3:19:45.560 --> 3:19:47.600
 talk or anything.

3:19:47.600 --> 3:19:52.220
 So I like my buddy, we call him the Viking, a soul Viking.

3:19:52.220 --> 3:19:57.400
 He looks like a Viking, his head's tattooed, he's been on the show.

3:19:57.400 --> 3:19:58.800
 He's so cool.

3:19:58.800 --> 3:20:01.760
 He's sitting directly across like you and I and he can see me, he's looking at me and

3:20:01.760 --> 3:20:08.720
 I'm throwing up and I do it about three times and then the last time he just saw me and

3:20:08.720 --> 3:20:12.120
 I couldn't do it, I threw it up.

3:20:12.120 --> 3:20:17.900
 And so I like to think that was her way of easing me in so I didn't get like a full punch

3:20:17.900 --> 3:20:18.900
 to the face.

3:20:18.900 --> 3:20:22.480
 But I gotta, let me take your hand and show you what I'm gonna show you.

3:20:22.480 --> 3:20:25.120
 We're gonna make you better, we're gonna take the pain away.

3:20:25.120 --> 3:20:27.760
 Aren't you supposed to eventually throw up no matter what?

3:20:27.760 --> 3:20:29.600
 It's not supposed to, some people don't.

3:20:29.600 --> 3:20:30.600
 You purge.

3:20:30.600 --> 3:20:33.560
 Yeah, if something's happening, you're going through something, yeah, you purge.

3:20:33.560 --> 3:20:34.840
 But it doesn't have to happen.

3:20:34.840 --> 3:20:37.960
 But this, I mean, within like the first 20 minutes, no.

3:20:37.960 --> 3:20:42.400
 It just takes like, you gotta sit and meditate for, or sit still basically and meditate

3:20:42.400 --> 3:20:48.260
 in the pitch black for about 45 minutes before the effects even, before you even feel her.

3:20:48.260 --> 3:20:50.080
 So it's very.

3:20:50.080 --> 3:20:52.960
 So here she figured out the right dose you need, maybe.

3:20:52.960 --> 3:20:55.000
 Well because I did the same dose as everyone else.

3:20:55.000 --> 3:21:01.760
 I think it was 20 mils, which doesn't seem like a lot, but when you've never done hiatus.

3:21:01.760 --> 3:21:03.760
 Oh my god.

3:21:03.760 --> 3:21:06.960
 So I felt like such a bitch.

3:21:06.960 --> 3:21:09.040
 God, I felt like such a bitch.

3:21:09.040 --> 3:21:11.440
 Okay, that was the thought going through your mind.

3:21:11.440 --> 3:21:13.160
 Oh, you just fucked it all up.

3:21:13.160 --> 3:21:14.160
 You ruined it.

3:21:14.160 --> 3:21:15.160
 You ruined this again.

3:21:15.160 --> 3:21:16.640
 You couldn't do this right?

3:21:16.640 --> 3:21:17.640
 Yeah.

3:21:17.640 --> 3:21:24.280
 And so at that point, we went through the meditation part and the shamans were, they

3:21:24.280 --> 3:21:26.600
 literally sing for like six hours straight.

3:21:26.600 --> 3:21:31.400
 So you sit there, you take it and then there's just what you're quietly listening to them.

3:21:31.400 --> 3:21:35.840
 Meditate and you wait and you wait and you're in pitch black, like can't see this far in

3:21:35.840 --> 3:21:37.560
 front of your face.

3:21:37.560 --> 3:21:41.680
 And you have a little puke bucket and then you have a little light that has a red filter

3:21:41.680 --> 3:21:42.680
 on it.

3:21:42.680 --> 3:21:44.920
 You have to get up to go to the bathroom to get out of the yurt and you use that so you

3:21:44.920 --> 3:21:47.320
 don't turn lights on.

3:21:47.320 --> 3:21:49.680
 And me, I brought like what?

3:21:49.680 --> 3:21:55.200
 No, it's just a cool visual of just a puke bucket and a little light for the, like I

3:21:55.200 --> 3:21:58.400
 can imagine these like little lights going every once in a while and then the rest is

3:21:58.400 --> 3:22:03.560
 just in darkness meditating with this singing.

3:22:03.560 --> 3:22:04.560
 It's so beautiful.

3:22:04.560 --> 3:22:05.560
 It's cool.

3:22:05.560 --> 3:22:06.560
 I would love to do that sometime.

3:22:06.560 --> 3:22:12.120
 Because trust me, you would, I wouldn't offer if it wasn't the group I would trust.

3:22:12.120 --> 3:22:14.520
 Yeah that's in, you had a very interesting group.

3:22:14.520 --> 3:22:16.760
 So it's the Heroic Hearts people.

3:22:16.760 --> 3:22:17.760
 Yeah, Heroic Hearts.

3:22:17.760 --> 3:22:20.560
 So they, yeah, this is my, Jesse gave us all these journals.

3:22:20.560 --> 3:22:22.380
 They're like, you're going to want these.

3:22:22.380 --> 3:22:26.960
 So he gave us all these journals and now this is like my Bible, like my work, my everything

3:22:26.960 --> 3:22:28.840
 goes in this with me everywhere.

3:22:28.840 --> 3:22:31.440
 It's just this like silent reminder for me.

3:22:31.440 --> 3:22:34.960
 And so Heroic Hearts does fantastic work.

3:22:34.960 --> 3:22:37.120
 I'll get into them after.

3:22:37.120 --> 3:22:44.400
 The thing with this group is there's such care.

3:22:44.400 --> 3:22:46.680
 It's not like go do AYA and like you're done.

3:22:46.680 --> 3:22:50.240
 There's like integration coaches and there's like doctors and there's like people to make

3:22:50.240 --> 3:22:55.360
 sure that you're doing the work because AYA is just the, is just the gate.

3:22:55.360 --> 3:22:59.800
 Now you have to take it and you have to implement it into your life.

3:22:59.800 --> 3:23:00.800
 People don't do that though.

3:23:00.800 --> 3:23:02.360
 Did you do like integration?

3:23:02.360 --> 3:23:04.480
 Did you do conversations with somebody?

3:23:04.480 --> 3:23:11.960
 Did you talk to, like, is there a process to, because similar with psilocybin you mentioned,

3:23:11.960 --> 3:23:16.720
 as I understand, it's exceptionally beneficial for when you also do like talk therapy.

3:23:16.720 --> 3:23:21.520
 Like you couple that with the integration in some form where you talk through your experience

3:23:21.520 --> 3:23:23.320
 and you talk through different things.

3:23:23.320 --> 3:23:27.960
 Like that seems to be a really, you know, I need to do that more with basically every

3:23:27.960 --> 3:23:28.960
 substance I take.

3:23:28.960 --> 3:23:33.240
 Like if I get, which I have been every once in a while known to do, a bit of vodka or

3:23:33.240 --> 3:23:37.800
 whiskey or whatever, like do integration the next day.

3:23:37.800 --> 3:23:38.800
 What did you learn?

3:23:38.800 --> 3:23:39.800
 What did you get from that?

3:23:39.800 --> 3:23:40.800
 What did you get?

3:23:40.800 --> 3:23:43.400
 Because you learn a lot, but you sometimes kind of just move on and you celebrate that

3:23:43.400 --> 3:23:46.240
 that happened, but like really kind of think through it.

3:23:46.240 --> 3:23:47.240
 Write it down.

3:23:47.240 --> 3:23:48.240
 Yeah.

3:23:48.240 --> 3:23:50.080
 It's important because that's what this was.

3:23:50.080 --> 3:23:55.200
 So the first night, I'll give like a very, because trust me, we could spend a whole podcast

3:23:55.200 --> 3:23:58.920
 on both of the, all three of those nights, but the first night, the biggest thing that

3:23:58.920 --> 3:24:04.000
 happened for me is I got to see my daughter, which was my first baby.

3:24:04.000 --> 3:24:07.360
 And so people say, well, you know, blah, blah, blah.

3:24:07.360 --> 3:24:08.360
 Fuck you.

3:24:08.360 --> 3:24:09.360
 That was my daughter.

3:24:09.360 --> 3:24:12.880
 And I'm very aware it was, I'm very conscious that it was.

3:24:12.880 --> 3:24:19.360
 And at that point, she just eased me in enough to let me know and showed me enough that this

3:24:19.360 --> 3:24:20.600
 wasn't it.

3:24:20.600 --> 3:24:23.680
 This wasn't the end all be all.

3:24:23.680 --> 3:24:28.760
 Where you are right now on this plane, on this dimension, in this life, this is, this

3:24:28.760 --> 3:24:34.720
 is a blip and it is, it is so minuscule to the big picture.

3:24:34.720 --> 3:24:40.280
 And so she really did that by, she showed me just a black and then like a crack.

3:24:40.280 --> 3:24:44.360
 And then these vibrant colors that I can't describe because there aren't words, Alex

3:24:44.360 --> 3:24:48.040
 Gray does really great art.

3:24:48.040 --> 3:24:51.480
 And that is like been the closest thing I've been able to find colors.

3:24:51.480 --> 3:24:56.720
 He's a famous guy who does ayahuasca and he's an artist.

3:24:56.720 --> 3:24:59.240
 I think he's got stuff in New York as well.

3:24:59.240 --> 3:25:07.600
 But she just, she eased me in and gave me some relief and showed me enough that I could

3:25:07.600 --> 3:25:12.960
 go, I could wake up the next day and not want to die the next day.

3:25:12.960 --> 3:25:16.360
 And so what Heroic Heart said, because they gave us all these journals, they're like,

3:25:16.360 --> 3:25:23.520
 you know, the next day you kind of wake up and you, you do a meet, like a meeting.

3:25:23.520 --> 3:25:24.520
 You do like a circle.

3:25:24.520 --> 3:25:27.960
 You just sit in a room and talk about what just happened the night before.

3:25:27.960 --> 3:25:32.680
 People are crying and people are quiet and you just listen and that's what you do.

3:25:32.680 --> 3:25:35.080
 And then you write on your free time.

3:25:35.080 --> 3:25:37.320
 So after that, it's like up to you what you want to do.

3:25:37.320 --> 3:25:38.840
 Do you want to just go walk in the woods?

3:25:38.840 --> 3:25:43.400
 Well, I chose to go find a fence post and lie on it for an hour.

3:25:43.400 --> 3:25:44.400
 I'm not kidding.

3:25:44.400 --> 3:25:48.120
 I lied there and stared up at these two eagles that were just in like the, I'll tell you

3:25:48.120 --> 3:25:50.960
 where we were after and you'll be like, oh, okay, I get it.

3:25:50.960 --> 3:25:59.400
 And then I found a forest and I just walked up with my book and I just lied there for

3:25:59.400 --> 3:26:01.920
 hours.

3:26:01.920 --> 3:26:05.320
 And then she all of a sudden started giving me what you call your downloads.

3:26:05.320 --> 3:26:09.240
 So the stuff you learn, the stuff that you were all of a sudden you're remembering and

3:26:09.240 --> 3:26:11.040
 these messages that come through.

3:26:11.040 --> 3:26:13.360
 And that's what this is.

3:26:13.360 --> 3:26:17.580
 What kind of things are we talking about?

3:26:17.580 --> 3:26:21.920
 So my biggest thing that she tried to reiterate to me at the beginning of that first night

3:26:21.920 --> 3:26:24.760
 was that I don't breathe.

3:26:24.760 --> 3:26:30.920
 I just, I don't, I don't breathe.

3:26:30.920 --> 3:26:32.840
 I don't fucking breathe at all.

3:26:32.840 --> 3:26:35.600
 I just, one thing to the next thing, the next thing, the next thing, the next thing just

3:26:35.600 --> 3:26:36.600
 to survive.

3:26:36.600 --> 3:26:39.120
 I don't take a minute and breathe.

3:26:39.120 --> 3:26:43.220
 And so she made, when I say she and I say it because it's hard for people to understand,

3:26:43.220 --> 3:26:47.120
 but I showed this to my husband, I showed it to my doctors and they're like, bitch, that's

3:26:47.120 --> 3:26:48.120
 not you.

3:26:48.120 --> 3:26:49.120
 You don't write like that.

3:26:49.120 --> 3:26:50.120
 You don't talk like that.

3:26:50.120 --> 3:26:57.560
 So like you can flip through it, but it was like, I'll just give, I'll just let Lex read

3:26:57.560 --> 3:26:59.240
 for a second and just, I'll just do here.

3:26:59.240 --> 3:27:01.160
 Let me do, I'll do an ad for heroic hearts.

3:27:01.160 --> 3:27:02.160
 Heroic hearts.

3:27:02.160 --> 3:27:04.800
 Here, I'll get my papers while you read.

3:27:04.800 --> 3:27:07.240
 Connect to her, listen to her, open to her.

3:27:07.240 --> 3:27:08.360
 Do you mind if I read some of these?

3:27:08.360 --> 3:27:09.360
 You can read some of it.

3:27:09.360 --> 3:27:10.360
 Yep.

3:27:10.360 --> 3:27:11.360
 Go right ahead.

3:27:11.360 --> 3:27:13.360
 The dark has lifted.

3:27:13.360 --> 3:27:16.760
 Judge my spelling and I'll punch you right in the face.

3:27:16.760 --> 3:27:22.640
 So there's like, it's very sporadic, sporadically written.

3:27:22.640 --> 3:27:24.240
 It's okay to be still.

3:27:24.240 --> 3:27:26.040
 It's okay to be quiet.

3:27:26.040 --> 3:27:28.480
 This is good.

3:27:28.480 --> 3:27:34.320
 Like what, and these are over a stretch of, that was the first, the first couple of pages

3:27:34.320 --> 3:27:36.480
 were from the first night.

3:27:36.480 --> 3:27:37.480
 This was just that weekend.

3:27:37.480 --> 3:27:40.600
 And you're just there laying looking at the Eagles.

3:27:40.600 --> 3:27:41.600
 Yeah.

3:27:41.600 --> 3:27:46.000
 With a pen, just frantic as well, Lex, not like writing where you're like, Oh, I'm just

3:27:46.000 --> 3:27:47.000
 writing.

3:27:47.000 --> 3:27:52.120
 It's like, I had to get it down or I was going to lose it.

3:27:52.120 --> 3:27:54.520
 You are warrior.

3:27:54.520 --> 3:27:56.360
 You are power.

3:27:56.360 --> 3:28:11.400
 You can choose now, breathe now, be now, be present, be warrior, be strength, breathe,

3:28:11.400 --> 3:28:12.400
 be the strength.

3:28:12.400 --> 3:28:15.000
 You are the strength.

3:28:15.000 --> 3:28:17.000
 There's some soul searching going on here.

3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:18.000
 This is incredible.

3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:19.000
 Yeah.

3:28:19.000 --> 3:28:20.000
 We wait till you get through.

3:28:20.000 --> 3:28:21.000
 You get in there.

3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:25.560
 She gets deep, real aggressive, like.

3:28:25.560 --> 3:28:33.920
 Crack the door for I am the light, the giver, the taker.

3:28:33.920 --> 3:28:34.920
 I am warrior.

3:28:34.920 --> 3:28:35.920
 I am life.

3:28:35.920 --> 3:28:36.920
 I am air.

3:28:36.920 --> 3:28:37.920
 I am water.

3:28:37.920 --> 3:28:39.400
 I am fire.

3:28:39.400 --> 3:28:44.320
 I am light.

3:28:44.320 --> 3:28:46.400
 This will, this can.

3:28:46.400 --> 3:28:49.760
 This will, this can.

3:28:49.760 --> 3:28:53.840
 For I am warrior.

3:28:53.840 --> 3:28:54.840
 For I am light.

3:28:54.840 --> 3:28:56.360
 And there's a leaf here.

3:28:56.360 --> 3:28:57.880
 What's the story with the leaf?

3:28:57.880 --> 3:28:58.880
 I don't know.

3:28:58.880 --> 3:29:02.160
 I was walking and every single time over the, over those three days, anytime I like went

3:29:02.160 --> 3:29:09.760
 for a walk by myself, I would just hear like, take this, like just almost like as if a voice

3:29:09.760 --> 3:29:12.440
 was standing there and be like, you need this, take it, take it with you and keep it in your

3:29:12.440 --> 3:29:13.440
 book.

3:29:13.440 --> 3:29:16.600
 Ground you.

3:29:16.600 --> 3:29:17.600
 And it just goes off.

3:29:17.600 --> 3:29:18.600
 So this is from there.

3:29:18.600 --> 3:29:19.600
 Yeah.

3:29:19.600 --> 3:29:23.160
 It's cool to have sort of, it's almost like time travel.

3:29:23.160 --> 3:29:28.400
 I have poppies from France too when I did a, I did a 75th anniversary D Day ride in France

3:29:28.400 --> 3:29:32.120
 where we rode 600 kilometers on our road bikes for charity.

3:29:32.120 --> 3:29:37.960
 And we landed on the beaches of Juneau on the 75th and we got to go by the poppy fields

3:29:37.960 --> 3:29:42.760
 and I'm like covered in poppies and I have some in a book.

3:29:42.760 --> 3:29:44.120
 I don't know why I do that.

3:29:44.120 --> 3:29:47.160
 I just, I do that.

3:29:47.160 --> 3:29:51.680
 That's cool because like, these are your thoughts and those are the physical items as it really

3:29:51.680 --> 3:29:55.200
 helps transport to that place somehow.

3:29:55.200 --> 3:29:56.680
 Let the light in, let her in.

3:29:56.680 --> 3:30:02.840
 And she would show me these visuals.

3:30:02.840 --> 3:30:12.120
 So my drawings are just like, yeah, there's drawings here and you're seeing this stuff.

3:30:12.120 --> 3:30:14.720
 Oh yeah.

3:30:14.720 --> 3:30:15.720
 I can't draw either.

3:30:15.720 --> 3:30:20.280
 So that's why they're so, I wish I could draw because if only I could translate what I could

3:30:20.280 --> 3:30:24.560
 see visually onto paper.

3:30:24.560 --> 3:30:26.320
 And you're talking to her.

3:30:26.320 --> 3:30:27.320
 Yeah.

3:30:27.320 --> 3:30:28.320
 It's time.

3:30:28.320 --> 3:30:32.000
 I'm here to listen.

3:30:32.000 --> 3:30:34.040
 Is this Mama Aya?

3:30:34.040 --> 3:30:35.040
 Yeah.

3:30:35.040 --> 3:30:36.040
 We call her Mama Aya.

3:30:36.040 --> 3:30:37.040
 Mama Aya.

3:30:37.040 --> 3:30:38.040
 Mama Aya.

3:30:38.040 --> 3:30:41.080
 So what, who, who are you seeing?

3:30:41.080 --> 3:30:42.380
 Is this a woman?

3:30:42.380 --> 3:30:46.160
 So for me at first, it was just eyes floating in the sky.

3:30:46.160 --> 3:30:50.920
 These unbelievably gorgeous, beautiful eyes that I, and I was like literally looking up

3:30:50.920 --> 3:30:55.040
 at the top of the yurt and I kept going to myself, is anyone else seeing this?

3:30:55.040 --> 3:30:59.160
 There's eyes in the sky.

3:30:59.160 --> 3:31:04.020
 And so there's these eyes floating and they just kept looking at me.

3:31:04.020 --> 3:31:07.080
 And I remember when I kept telling myself like, oh, don't worry about it, there's nothing

3:31:07.080 --> 3:31:08.080
 there.

3:31:08.080 --> 3:31:09.520
 She would get angry.

3:31:09.520 --> 3:31:11.480
 I'm right here.

3:31:11.480 --> 3:31:12.480
 Pay attention to me.

3:31:12.480 --> 3:31:17.640
 And I'd be like, okay, like forceful, like very forceful.

3:31:17.640 --> 3:31:20.520
 So at first it was just the eyes.

3:31:20.520 --> 3:31:32.200
 The second night, is I'm crazy when I say this, great, that's going to be my clip, easy

3:31:32.200 --> 3:31:33.200
 on crazy.

3:31:33.200 --> 3:31:35.760
 It's what I do when I get uncomfortable.

3:31:35.760 --> 3:31:37.960
 I do weird hand gestures and movements.

3:31:37.960 --> 3:31:40.080
 Voices, I like it.

3:31:40.080 --> 3:31:41.080
 Yeah, I do.

3:31:41.080 --> 3:31:42.080
 Yeah.

3:31:42.080 --> 3:31:48.120
 You would hate to be in my office because most of the day it's just this weird lunges

3:31:48.120 --> 3:31:50.440
 and uncomfortable moments.

3:31:50.440 --> 3:31:54.960
 She turned me into a wolf.

3:31:54.960 --> 3:31:55.960
 I know I said it out loud.

3:31:55.960 --> 3:32:01.380
 I said, I hear it, I said it, head to toe.

3:32:01.380 --> 3:32:07.600
 And her takeaway for me was, I'm trying to be this pack leader, I'm trying to be this

3:32:07.600 --> 3:32:08.600
 leader in my life.

3:32:08.600 --> 3:32:13.820
 I'm trying to do these things, but I'm going about them the whole wrong way.

3:32:13.820 --> 3:32:18.080
 So like when the shamans call you up to do their special prayer over you, you go up,

3:32:18.080 --> 3:32:19.080
 you don't touch them.

3:32:19.080 --> 3:32:20.080
 They flash their little light.

3:32:20.080 --> 3:32:24.080
 You see the little light spot, you walk to the light, you sit down on the light.

3:32:24.080 --> 3:32:27.480
 And then my shaman, he's so funny because he's got this great tone in his voice.

3:32:27.480 --> 3:32:31.440
 He goes, how are you doing Kelsey?

3:32:31.440 --> 3:32:37.240
 And I'm like, so hi, yeah, I have a problem.

3:32:37.240 --> 3:32:39.560
 I'm a wolf and I need it to stop.

3:32:39.560 --> 3:32:42.600
 And he'd be like, don't you worry girl, I got you, you ready?

3:32:42.600 --> 3:32:44.600
 And I was like, uh huh, uh huh.

3:32:44.600 --> 3:32:48.400
 So I'm sitting there cross legged, I've got my palms out like this.

3:32:48.400 --> 3:32:50.240
 And I had a really traumatic shoulder injury.

3:32:50.240 --> 3:32:51.860
 So I don't just sit slanted like this.

3:32:51.860 --> 3:32:55.240
 My shoulders actually permanently detached and no one in the world will touch it or fix

3:32:55.240 --> 3:32:56.240
 it.

3:32:56.240 --> 3:33:00.960
 My collarbone comes out my back here and I don't have any collarbone here.

3:33:00.960 --> 3:33:02.520
 So nobody will fix it.

3:33:02.520 --> 3:33:03.880
 No one will touch it.

3:33:03.880 --> 3:33:06.840
 Even I've had specialists, I've had surgeries, no one will do anything with it.

3:33:06.840 --> 3:33:09.640
 So I'm permanently down and forward.

3:33:09.640 --> 3:33:14.920
 So I slouch, it's horrible.

3:33:14.920 --> 3:33:15.920
 So before I.

3:33:15.920 --> 3:33:16.920
 Functionally too.

3:33:16.920 --> 3:33:17.920
 Oh, there's nothing.

3:33:17.920 --> 3:33:18.920
 I can't do a pull up anymore.

3:33:18.920 --> 3:33:19.920
 Oh, so weak.

3:33:19.920 --> 3:33:20.920
 Oh, wow.

3:33:20.920 --> 3:33:26.480
 Oh, you should, I'll show you how to do a pushup after you'll fucking throw up in embarrassment.

3:33:26.480 --> 3:33:27.700
 Yeah, it's bad.

3:33:27.700 --> 3:33:32.120
 So before I though, chronic pain, like had to drink a bottle of CBD every day just to

3:33:32.120 --> 3:33:38.040
 the pain is so bad because the trauma and it was so bad, the surgery went wrong.

3:33:38.040 --> 3:33:40.740
 The collarbone dissipated and no longer exists.

3:33:40.740 --> 3:33:44.920
 Like there's just, and they're not sure how I lift things with it and do stuff with it.

3:33:44.920 --> 3:33:46.920
 It's like overcompensation everywhere.

3:33:46.920 --> 3:33:53.080
 Like my, the, my back, like, um, my trap, my scapula, like flares outward.

3:33:53.080 --> 3:33:54.880
 It's I'm all messed up from it.

3:33:54.880 --> 3:33:56.480
 And so I was in chronic pain.

3:33:56.480 --> 3:34:03.720
 So he's praying over me and all of a sudden all I feel is this arm just start just fucking

3:34:03.720 --> 3:34:08.440
 vibrating and my hair's really long and I feel somebody grabbed the back of my ponytail

3:34:08.440 --> 3:34:12.140
 and snap my head back like this.

3:34:12.140 --> 3:34:18.920
 And it felt like something was coming out of my throat, like being pulled out of me

3:34:18.920 --> 3:34:22.200
 in the takeaway that I ended up in the whole, the rest of the night, there was a million

3:34:22.200 --> 3:34:23.200
 other things.

3:34:23.200 --> 3:34:30.160
 And the takeaway was you no longer need to bite.

3:34:30.160 --> 3:34:32.560
 You may only show your teeth.

3:34:32.560 --> 3:34:35.320
 You can be the leader that you want to be.

3:34:35.320 --> 3:34:39.460
 You do not always have to be the traditional type of leader.

3:34:39.460 --> 3:34:41.120
 You can be in the back of the pack.

3:34:41.120 --> 3:34:46.920
 You have to watch the rest around you be, be mindful of those around you instead of

3:34:46.920 --> 3:34:50.620
 just being upfront, be, be behind as well.

3:34:50.620 --> 3:34:54.680
 Make sure that every thing that you're doing is all being looked after.

3:34:54.680 --> 3:34:58.120
 Because my thing was I will rip your fucking head off if you just say the wrong thing to

3:34:58.120 --> 3:34:59.760
 me before.

3:34:59.760 --> 3:35:03.880
 The whole thing was you can just show your teeth and that is more than enough.

3:35:03.880 --> 3:35:07.160
 Stop trying to be, stop trying to overcompensate.

3:35:07.160 --> 3:35:09.400
 You don't need to do that any longer.

3:35:09.400 --> 3:35:15.920
 And then I had this weird astral projection thing happen like where I was in my house

3:35:15.920 --> 3:35:22.520
 and there were these flyers all over my husband and my son and like I went ham on them.

3:35:22.520 --> 3:35:24.640
 I like shredded them to pieces.

3:35:24.640 --> 3:35:28.120
 Like I was this protector.

3:35:28.120 --> 3:35:33.280
 And it's crazy because the guys told me after like someone would be like, there were flyers

3:35:33.280 --> 3:35:35.120
 all over you the whole night.

3:35:35.120 --> 3:35:36.200
 They were just all over you.

3:35:36.200 --> 3:35:38.800
 And I'm like, I was snarling when I was sitting there.

3:35:38.800 --> 3:35:43.920
 Like the shaman had to be like, I need you to try to calm your breathing after I could.

3:35:43.920 --> 3:35:50.200
 But before like I was like attacking things beside me that people could see and I could

3:35:50.200 --> 3:35:53.400
 see but couldn't wrap my brain around that they were real.

3:35:53.400 --> 3:35:54.400
 Like it was weird.

3:35:54.400 --> 3:35:58.440
 This is a crazy man.

3:35:58.440 --> 3:35:59.440
 That's day two.

3:35:59.440 --> 3:36:00.440
 That's day two.

3:36:00.440 --> 3:36:03.760
 And so what's the big takeaway there?

3:36:03.760 --> 3:36:11.480
 My takeaway was I needed to be, I needed to stop trying to, stop trying to push everything

3:36:11.480 --> 3:36:12.480
 too hard.

3:36:12.480 --> 3:36:14.560
 Stop trying to force everything.

3:36:14.560 --> 3:36:15.680
 It's all going to come.

3:36:15.680 --> 3:36:17.080
 It's all going to happen.

3:36:17.080 --> 3:36:20.160
 But you are, you are too aggressive.

3:36:20.160 --> 3:36:26.240
 You are too, you're trying so hard that you're missing, you're missing everything else.

3:36:26.240 --> 3:36:27.240
 Got it.

3:36:27.240 --> 3:36:31.480
 That's just how to be a better human kind of thing.

3:36:31.480 --> 3:36:32.800
 Right.

3:36:32.800 --> 3:36:33.800
 This is getting intense.

3:36:33.800 --> 3:36:34.800
 Yeah, it gets aggressive.

3:36:34.800 --> 3:36:35.800
 Yeah, it gets aggressive.

3:36:35.800 --> 3:36:42.520
 I mean there's love and light still.

3:36:42.520 --> 3:36:43.520
 It gets better.

3:36:43.520 --> 3:36:44.520
 Love and light.

3:36:44.520 --> 3:36:48.680
 Love and light the warrior within is calm.

3:36:48.680 --> 3:36:50.520
 She will test you daily.

3:36:50.520 --> 3:36:52.160
 Show her respect.

3:36:52.160 --> 3:36:53.160
 So that's what I mean.

3:36:53.160 --> 3:36:54.160
 You've read my book.

3:36:54.160 --> 3:36:55.160
 You know I don't write like that.

3:36:55.160 --> 3:36:56.160
 Yeah.

3:36:56.160 --> 3:36:57.160
 This is strange.

3:36:57.160 --> 3:36:58.160
 See?

3:36:58.160 --> 3:36:59.160
 Good.

3:36:59.160 --> 3:37:00.160
 You get it.

3:37:00.160 --> 3:37:04.640
 Because people don't understand when I say I didn't, I don't feel like I wrote that.

3:37:04.640 --> 3:37:10.280
 I feel like she gave me, like I reread this all of the time.

3:37:10.280 --> 3:37:16.160
 So I wonder, I mean, well not obviously, but this is somehow part of you.

3:37:16.160 --> 3:37:18.840
 I think it's a part of me obviously.

3:37:18.840 --> 3:37:20.480
 Reconnecting you somehow to that part.

3:37:20.480 --> 3:37:24.840
 It kind of is incredible to think of what are the things that are part of us that we

3:37:24.840 --> 3:37:26.880
 haven't really explored, you know.

3:37:26.880 --> 3:37:28.920
 And there's so many.

3:37:28.920 --> 3:37:29.920
 We just get to talk.

3:37:29.920 --> 3:37:30.920
 Nature.

3:37:30.920 --> 3:37:31.920
 To connect to her.

3:37:31.920 --> 3:37:34.520
 Feel her flow through them.

3:37:34.520 --> 3:37:39.360
 Use them for the strength for each day a new challenge will present itself.

3:37:39.360 --> 3:37:40.360
 Love.

3:37:40.360 --> 3:37:41.360
 Light.

3:37:41.360 --> 3:37:42.360
 Breathe.

3:37:42.360 --> 3:37:45.120
 Sorry I have too much hair.

3:37:45.120 --> 3:37:46.120
 Never enough.

3:37:46.120 --> 3:37:47.120
 I used to have long hair.

3:37:47.120 --> 3:37:48.480
 What about day three?

3:37:48.480 --> 3:37:52.640
 So day three is the, the stuff I talked about on Jocko.

3:37:52.640 --> 3:37:55.080
 When I got taken over to the other side.

3:37:55.080 --> 3:37:57.240
 I almost missed that night too.

3:37:57.240 --> 3:37:59.160
 I almost missed that ceremony.

3:37:59.160 --> 3:38:04.920
 I got a false positive on my COVID test and I got a call from the medical clinic that

3:38:04.920 --> 3:38:07.920
 night being like, you need to come in.

3:38:07.920 --> 3:38:10.240
 You got a false positive on your COVID test.

3:38:10.240 --> 3:38:14.120
 And if you're going to travel, you have to, we got to figure this out.

3:38:14.120 --> 3:38:15.120
 You got to come do blood work.

3:38:15.120 --> 3:38:19.320
 You got to come do, you know, whatever it is you need to do if you want to get home,

3:38:19.320 --> 3:38:21.280
 but you got to come do something.

3:38:21.280 --> 3:38:24.920
 And so I didn't think I was going to be in ceremony.

3:38:24.920 --> 3:38:25.920
 I had to leave.

3:38:25.920 --> 3:38:35.660
 So I left and you know, they waited, they waited for me.

3:38:35.660 --> 3:38:43.500
 And so I think the biggest takeaway from all of this for me was this isn't it.

3:38:43.500 --> 3:38:45.280
 This isn't everything.

3:38:45.280 --> 3:38:49.500
 This isn't the end all be all.

3:38:49.500 --> 3:38:50.960
 You can fight through this.

3:38:50.960 --> 3:38:52.480
 This is possible.

3:38:52.480 --> 3:38:53.520
 It's going to take work.

3:38:53.520 --> 3:38:55.540
 It's going to be fucking hard.

3:38:55.540 --> 3:38:56.540
 It's worth it though.

3:38:56.540 --> 3:39:01.640
 And if you just keep going in the right direction, everything that I wrote down, everything,

3:39:01.640 --> 3:39:05.000
 every goal, it'll happen.

3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:07.040
 What about love?

3:39:07.040 --> 3:39:09.540
 What about love?

3:39:09.540 --> 3:39:10.540
 Tell me about your husband.

3:39:10.540 --> 3:39:11.540
 Okay.

3:39:11.540 --> 3:39:12.760
 He's the best.

3:39:12.760 --> 3:39:15.960
 What role did he play in your life?

3:39:15.960 --> 3:39:17.440
 The most pivotal role.

3:39:17.440 --> 3:39:22.920
 He kept me alive and made me feel worthy enough to, until I knew that I was worthy enough

3:39:22.920 --> 3:39:25.160
 to be alive.

3:39:25.160 --> 3:39:26.440
 Can you dissect that a little bit?

3:39:26.440 --> 3:39:31.040
 Like what, I mean, what role does love play in the human condition?

3:39:31.040 --> 3:39:36.120
 I think love is the only reason that we haven't destroyed ourselves.

3:39:36.120 --> 3:39:39.080
 I mean, we humans in general.

3:39:39.080 --> 3:39:40.080
 Yes.

3:39:40.080 --> 3:39:46.480
 I think there is a subset of people where love will always be, you know, love conquers

3:39:46.480 --> 3:39:49.720
 all, you know, but that's not always the reality.

3:39:49.720 --> 3:39:56.040
 The reality is life is messy and humans are messy and the way we choose to deal with things

3:39:56.040 --> 3:40:02.780
 are messy and complicated and difficult, but at the root of all good is love, I think.

3:40:02.780 --> 3:40:11.240
 And for me, I was fortunate enough to meet my husband through a friend, which you listened

3:40:11.240 --> 3:40:12.240
 to that podcast.

3:40:12.240 --> 3:40:16.520
 So I don't know that we need to, unless you really want to go into that story again, how

3:40:16.520 --> 3:40:18.000
 I met my husband.

3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:21.920
 Well, the only part of that story I like, people should just go listen to the Jackal

3:40:21.920 --> 3:40:23.840
 podcast is how you made him uncomfortable.

3:40:23.840 --> 3:40:24.840
 I love it.

3:40:24.840 --> 3:40:25.840
 I, well, okay.

3:40:25.840 --> 3:40:26.840
 So how it works, let me explain.

3:40:26.840 --> 3:40:29.440
 In the supercross and motocross industry, it's really small.

3:40:29.440 --> 3:40:32.180
 The people who are professional, there's, it's a small subset of people.

3:40:32.180 --> 3:40:35.020
 It's kind of like formula one, 21 cars.

3:40:35.020 --> 3:40:36.020
 That's what there is.

3:40:36.020 --> 3:40:37.020
 That's the amount of riders.

3:40:37.020 --> 3:40:40.240
 And we should say your husband is a motocross guy.

3:40:40.240 --> 3:40:44.680
 My husband was a professional supercross and motocross racer for his whole life.

3:40:44.680 --> 3:40:48.560
 And he raced for Kawasaki and Suzuki.

3:40:48.560 --> 3:40:51.280
 He lived in California and raced all down there.

3:40:51.280 --> 3:40:54.280
 And when I met him, I met him at the tail end of his career.

3:40:54.280 --> 3:41:00.860
 And so I went to Montreal with a friend of mine to see somebody that I was currently

3:41:00.860 --> 3:41:08.480
 sleeping with, who was a friend of mine and end up meeting Brady instead.

3:41:08.480 --> 3:41:09.480
 Yeah.

3:41:09.480 --> 3:41:13.440
 And the funny moment in Jackal's podcast was saying that I was fucking him instead

3:41:13.440 --> 3:41:14.920
 of just sleeping with him.

3:41:14.920 --> 3:41:18.680
 And then Jackal's face exploded and Jackal was like, oh, sleeping.

3:41:18.680 --> 3:41:23.100
 So like he was, he was trying to get details of the sleeping quarters that you're just

3:41:23.100 --> 3:41:26.800
 trying to get you to define as a good interviewer would, oh, sleeping, okay.

3:41:26.800 --> 3:41:32.080
 And then you were like, it's fucking Jackal or something like that.

3:41:32.080 --> 3:41:33.080
 It was great.

3:41:33.080 --> 3:41:34.080
 It was great.

3:41:34.080 --> 3:41:37.500
 But that's true because in that industry, it's like, we, it's small.

3:41:37.500 --> 3:41:41.600
 We all share, trust me, is what it is.

3:41:41.600 --> 3:41:45.240
 And it was, so I met him there and he had broken his wrist really, really bad.

3:41:45.240 --> 3:41:48.680
 And I was, this was before I deployed.

3:41:48.680 --> 3:41:54.220
 So I met him and I, we stayed in touch and just became friends and just texted.

3:41:54.220 --> 3:41:55.220
 That was it.

3:41:55.220 --> 3:41:56.220
 Nothing weird.

3:41:56.220 --> 3:41:57.640
 And I was deploying though.

3:41:57.640 --> 3:42:00.160
 So we just agreed, you know, we'd be friends.

3:42:00.160 --> 3:42:04.080
 We weren't actually talking about anything romantically at all.

3:42:04.080 --> 3:42:09.360
 And then I deployed and we got talking and to know each other a little more, a little

3:42:09.360 --> 3:42:10.640
 more.

3:42:10.640 --> 3:42:14.160
 And then we decided that we liked each other and we wanted to try to give it at least a

3:42:14.160 --> 3:42:15.440
 semi shot.

3:42:15.440 --> 3:42:21.720
 And so when I got home from Afghanistan, I went and watched him race his last, one of

3:42:21.720 --> 3:42:27.280
 his last two races that he did professionally before he retired, excuse me.

3:42:27.280 --> 3:42:34.080
 And it was in Montreal and one was in Vegas and I hadn't seen him and he didn't really

3:42:34.080 --> 3:42:35.080
 know me.

3:42:35.080 --> 3:42:36.440
 We didn't really know each other.

3:42:36.440 --> 3:42:41.040
 We met, I slept in the bed beside him because my girlfriend didn't want to get in trouble

3:42:41.040 --> 3:42:45.080
 from her boyfriend from sleeping beside a random dude.

3:42:45.080 --> 3:42:54.080
 And then, yeah, we just, we started dating and he really slowly became my rock and he

3:42:54.080 --> 3:42:55.520
 understands trauma.

3:42:55.520 --> 3:43:00.640
 He had some stuff happen in his life and his family that he went through a lot of therapy.

3:43:00.640 --> 3:43:01.640
 He went through a lot of shit.

3:43:01.640 --> 3:43:07.200
 He went, he saw what traumatic situations can do to a family and to people and those

3:43:07.200 --> 3:43:09.420
 that are suffering with it.

3:43:09.420 --> 3:43:15.420
 And so he was well equipped to handle me, thankfully.

3:43:15.420 --> 3:43:18.320
 And it got to a point where we were doing the long distance back and forth, back and

3:43:18.320 --> 3:43:19.320
 forth and back and forth.

3:43:19.320 --> 3:43:23.240
 And I finally got the call that I was going to be released from the military and I wanted

3:43:23.240 --> 3:43:26.640
 to live near him, but I couldn't afford to live in British Columbia because I was from

3:43:26.640 --> 3:43:31.160
 Ontario and BC is like, it means bring cash for a reason.

3:43:31.160 --> 3:43:32.440
 I'm like, there's no way I can live there.

3:43:32.440 --> 3:43:35.280
 And then his family was like, come live with us.

3:43:35.280 --> 3:43:37.400
 They had a big enough house.

3:43:37.400 --> 3:43:39.040
 They had a big enough house.

3:43:39.040 --> 3:43:40.520
 Trust me, it was fine.

3:43:40.520 --> 3:43:42.440
 So I was like, okay.

3:43:42.440 --> 3:43:49.000
 And so I went from dating this guy long distance to over from 2009 to 2011, just back and forth,

3:43:49.000 --> 3:43:50.880
 back and forth, back and forth.

3:43:50.880 --> 3:43:53.600
 And then finally his parents were like, should her get off the pot here with her?

3:43:53.600 --> 3:43:54.600
 Come on.

3:43:54.600 --> 3:43:58.280
 It's obvious she loves you and I would never say it.

3:43:58.280 --> 3:44:00.320
 That word just as a love.

3:44:00.320 --> 3:44:07.720
 Like it was just, I couldn't say for a long time, for a long time because I was dead inside.

3:44:07.720 --> 3:44:11.700
 I didn't know what that meant because I couldn't feel, I didn't feel anything.

3:44:11.700 --> 3:44:15.120
 He loved it because he like, we go, we go do something.

3:44:15.120 --> 3:44:17.440
 You would never complain about anything.

3:44:17.440 --> 3:44:19.760
 You wouldn't say a fucking word.

3:44:19.760 --> 3:44:20.960
 You would just sit there.

3:44:20.960 --> 3:44:26.000
 And now you got all your feelings back and your emotions back and now you're too hot

3:44:26.000 --> 3:44:27.000
 and you're too cold.

3:44:27.000 --> 3:44:29.520
 And anyways, so yeah, he loved it.

3:44:29.520 --> 3:44:30.880
 I was numb and dead inside.

3:44:30.880 --> 3:44:32.280
 Seriously, when I call him back.

3:44:32.280 --> 3:44:34.160
 Were you still able to have fun together?

3:44:34.160 --> 3:44:35.160
 That kind of thing?

3:44:35.160 --> 3:44:39.680
 Like when you say there's no emotion, there's more emotion around the basics of like everyday

3:44:39.680 --> 3:44:43.880
 life, but you're still able to just like enjoy shit together?

3:44:43.880 --> 3:44:49.000
 I was enjoying stuff, but I wasn't feeling.

3:44:49.000 --> 3:44:50.000
 I was like, this is fun.

3:44:50.000 --> 3:44:51.000
 Yeah.

3:44:51.000 --> 3:44:52.000
 Right.

3:44:52.000 --> 3:44:53.000
 That was it.

3:44:53.000 --> 3:44:54.000
 That was surface level like Lex, this is fun.

3:44:54.000 --> 3:44:55.000
 It wasn't.

3:44:55.000 --> 3:44:56.000
 There's nothing there.

3:44:56.000 --> 3:45:02.440
 Yeah, no, there's nothing that, Hey, yeah, nothing.

3:45:02.440 --> 3:45:06.520
 And so we went through that for a long time and then I lived with his parents and we,

3:45:06.520 --> 3:45:09.120
 we lived there and that was, you know, God damn it.

3:45:09.120 --> 3:45:12.280
 His family was so good to me because I was a nightmare.

3:45:12.280 --> 3:45:14.040
 I was a nightmare.

3:45:14.040 --> 3:45:16.080
 Couldn't cook certain food around me anymore.

3:45:16.080 --> 3:45:18.280
 Couldn't, couldn't go certain places anymore.

3:45:18.280 --> 3:45:22.080
 Couldn't, you know, crowds were in hard no, we didn't do Canada today.

3:45:22.080 --> 3:45:26.880
 And like, I just changed, I moved in and was like, shit's got to change.

3:45:26.880 --> 3:45:31.000
 If you guys don't want me to kill everyone, like, and they were willing and they were

3:45:31.000 --> 3:45:34.080
 accepting and they were amazing about it.

3:45:34.080 --> 3:45:37.760
 And then we finally said, okay, well like, does this, is this, we're good.

3:45:37.760 --> 3:45:44.360
 We're like, I said, I used to say like, I L you like, I couldn't say love.

3:45:44.360 --> 3:45:46.680
 It freaked me out for a long time.

3:45:46.680 --> 3:45:50.840
 And then I finally said it and then that shit had said it like a month later and I was like,

3:45:50.840 --> 3:45:51.840
 that's not fair.

3:45:51.840 --> 3:45:52.840
 That's not the same exact time.

3:45:52.840 --> 3:45:53.840
 I wanted the response.

3:45:53.840 --> 3:45:54.840
 Yeah.

3:45:54.840 --> 3:46:00.560
 And he goes to treatment with me, he, whatever I need, he knows that like, hey, it's more

3:46:00.560 --> 3:46:04.040
 for like him and like, how do I handle her?

3:46:04.040 --> 3:46:07.880
 And then we moved out and we bought a house and then he took a sweet ass time.

3:46:07.880 --> 3:46:12.720
 We were dating for four years before we were engaged because just to be sure the crazy

3:46:12.720 --> 3:46:15.520
 wasn't too crazy, he waited four years on that.

3:46:15.520 --> 3:46:16.520
 Smart man.

3:46:16.520 --> 3:46:17.520
 Right?

3:46:17.520 --> 3:46:18.520
 Yeah.

3:46:18.520 --> 3:46:20.800
 Or you can, you could say he's just terrified of commitment, but both.

3:46:20.800 --> 3:46:21.800
 A little bit of both.

3:46:21.800 --> 3:46:26.280
 Hey, when you were the guy on the posters that all the girls sign up to, that sent all

3:46:26.280 --> 3:46:28.680
 the dirty pictures, fucking why are you giving that up?

3:46:28.680 --> 3:46:29.680
 It's easy.

3:46:29.680 --> 3:46:30.680
 Yeah.

3:46:30.680 --> 3:46:31.680
 Commitment is a real commitment then.

3:46:31.680 --> 3:46:32.680
 Yeah.

3:46:32.680 --> 3:46:33.680
 Okay.

3:46:33.680 --> 3:46:37.760
 This is the Jaco reset.

3:46:37.760 --> 3:46:40.400
 We talked about Brass in Unity a little bit.

3:46:40.400 --> 3:46:46.200
 What's the longterm mission goal and dream of your company and the podcast of the same

3:46:46.200 --> 3:46:47.680
 name?

3:46:47.680 --> 3:46:54.600
 So for me, what I've been trying to do with this company is create a community that can

3:46:54.600 --> 3:46:59.620
 really work together to not only help vets, first responders, but to really bridge the

3:46:59.620 --> 3:47:03.760
 gap with the civilian population and letting them know what we kind of go through and why

3:47:03.760 --> 3:47:09.800
 it is such a epidemic and why there is over 22 suicides a day and we are losing people

3:47:09.800 --> 3:47:13.960
 like it's going out of style, like the amount of vets that are questioning the last 20 years

3:47:13.960 --> 3:47:18.760
 of their life right now is terrifying.

3:47:18.760 --> 3:47:22.340
 I work with organizations that are doing this outreach and they're overloaded right now

3:47:22.340 --> 3:47:28.160
 like they have never seen before because this whole thing is just, it's hit ahead here.

3:47:28.160 --> 3:47:33.080
 And so what Brass in Unity tries to do is it is really just a vehicle to get the money

3:47:33.080 --> 3:47:35.520
 in the hands of the people that are doing the work with it.

3:47:35.520 --> 3:47:38.680
 I couldn't start a nonprofit because I'm not good at fundraising.

3:47:38.680 --> 3:47:42.920
 I'm not good at being like, give me your money, I'm going to do this with it.

3:47:42.920 --> 3:47:47.280
 The least I could do is come up with a product that I know I could give to people or people

3:47:47.280 --> 3:47:56.640
 could purchase and if I gave pretty much all of the actual profit from it to those organizations

3:47:56.640 --> 3:48:02.100
 and I give them something to wear that is a touch piece or if they're out and somebody

3:48:02.100 --> 3:48:04.920
 sees a bullet on the wrist they go, hey, what is that?

3:48:04.920 --> 3:48:10.880
 It's a conversation starter and that's exactly what it's been and it's done its job as that.

3:48:10.880 --> 3:48:14.520
 And so we, like I said, we are a way to get the vehicle, we're the vehicle, we're the

3:48:14.520 --> 3:48:15.900
 money in the hands of the people.

3:48:15.900 --> 3:48:18.480
 People don't always want to just get a tax receipt.

3:48:18.480 --> 3:48:22.960
 It's great to donate to something, great on you to do that but most people have a selfish

3:48:22.960 --> 3:48:28.580
 aspect and that's okay but if you can tap into that you can then fund these charities

3:48:28.580 --> 3:48:32.240
 properly and give them the tools to do their jobs effectively.

3:48:32.240 --> 3:48:36.360
 Up until this point they just count on people's goodness of their hearts.

3:48:36.360 --> 3:48:38.900
 Hate to break it to you, humanity is rough right now.

3:48:38.900 --> 3:48:40.960
 We need to look at something a little differently.

3:48:40.960 --> 3:48:46.960
 So these things spark, like a jewelry sparks conversations and then do you work with charities?

3:48:46.960 --> 3:48:49.100
 Yes, oh God, yeah, that's what I do.

3:48:49.100 --> 3:48:54.080
 So my whole mission every day is I get up, I push jewelry and sunglasses on people and

3:48:54.080 --> 3:48:59.480
 say but now that you're gonna wear that, now you're a part of the B&U Army, now you're

3:48:59.480 --> 3:49:00.480
 a part of this community.

3:49:00.480 --> 3:49:05.820
 Speaking of which, let me put it right back on, branded.

3:49:05.820 --> 3:49:07.960
 This is organic product placement.

3:49:07.960 --> 3:49:13.280
 Yeah, this isn't like marketing at all, nothing weird about this at all and so we work with

3:49:13.280 --> 3:49:17.400
 a lot of organizations and I'm very particular about where we send our money because there

3:49:17.400 --> 3:49:24.240
 are, it feels like thousands of vet organizations right now and if we were able to consolidate,

3:49:24.240 --> 3:49:25.240
 it would be more ideal.

3:49:25.240 --> 3:49:28.120
 I spoke about that on another show but that's not currently happening.

3:49:28.120 --> 3:49:32.720
 So I try to work with the nonprofits I know, number one, are not paying six figure salaries

3:49:32.720 --> 3:49:36.180
 which trust me, there's lots, a lot.

3:49:36.180 --> 3:49:39.900
 Number two, I look at the actual resources that they're providing and if they're going

3:49:39.900 --> 3:49:43.400
 to be something that are gonna be useful, in my opinion, whether or not they're actually

3:49:43.400 --> 3:49:46.400
 useful and I just don't think they are, that's up for debate.

3:49:46.400 --> 3:49:50.160
 I know it's worked for me so I try to fund the things that I know have been helpful for

3:49:50.160 --> 3:49:52.720
 me and the people I associate with.

3:49:52.720 --> 3:49:57.900
 So that's why I brought all the paper because I didn't wanna be an idiot and forget anybody

3:49:57.900 --> 3:50:01.160
 that's really important because I get caught up in things and I think it's important to

3:50:01.160 --> 3:50:02.160
 acknowledge.

3:50:02.160 --> 3:50:09.520
 So number one, Heroic Hearts, we just started working to talk about them and really make

3:50:09.520 --> 3:50:12.280
 them known but we're gonna be donating to them as well.

3:50:12.280 --> 3:50:15.040
 Are they doing more stuff than the ayahuasca thing?

3:50:15.040 --> 3:50:19.160
 Yeah, so their points are, I got Jesse to actually, I'm like what are your talking points

3:50:19.160 --> 3:50:21.840
 because I need people to know exactly what you do.

3:50:21.840 --> 3:50:25.120
 So veterans have had to take their mental and general health into their own hands due

3:50:25.120 --> 3:50:29.400
 to the failure of the government system so that is why they were created but Heroic

3:50:29.400 --> 3:50:34.300
 Hearts is a peer supported mental health network involving full preparation, integration, coaching

3:50:34.300 --> 3:50:36.560
 and connection to vetted psychedelic treatments.

3:50:36.560 --> 3:50:42.480
 So they don't just do ayahuasca, they deal with psilocybin, ketamine, ibogaine but they've

3:50:42.480 --> 3:50:47.480
 got protocols in place, they've got locations you go to that are safely vetted and they

3:50:47.480 --> 3:50:48.480
 work.

3:50:48.480 --> 3:50:53.760
 They've got over right now, Jesse said they have 800 veterans on a waiting list for treatment.

3:50:53.760 --> 3:50:57.900
 That's just before the spike of the end of this war.

3:50:57.900 --> 3:51:02.280
 They have over a hundred, they've helped over a hundred veterans including dozens of special

3:51:02.280 --> 3:51:04.960
 operation vets find effective care.

3:51:04.960 --> 3:51:09.360
 They've now got branches in the US, UK and Canada and the biggest thing about them and

3:51:09.360 --> 3:51:14.740
 why we talk about them is because the problem of psychedelics and the stigma around it is

3:51:14.740 --> 3:51:19.080
 so significant but because of great universities that are now stepping up and doing the research

3:51:19.080 --> 3:51:21.360
 behind it, it is being legitimized.

3:51:21.360 --> 3:51:26.400
 So like they're doing that, in Canada there's a group called Theracil, they are currently

3:51:26.400 --> 3:51:31.720
 fighting the government to get the rights for Canadians under section 56 of our laws

3:51:31.720 --> 3:51:34.920
 to get compassionate care for psilocybin use.

3:51:34.920 --> 3:51:40.480
 I've done a panel with them on that really great base out of Victoria, really smart people.

3:51:40.480 --> 3:51:44.200
 One of the other bigger charities that we work with and they're honestly, they were

3:51:44.200 --> 3:51:48.440
 my first and foremost charity that I ever worked with and they're a big component in

3:51:48.440 --> 3:51:51.000
 the veteran community in Canada.

3:51:51.000 --> 3:51:57.680
 They're called Honour House and Honour House was started by honorary Colonel Aldi Genova.

3:51:57.680 --> 3:52:00.120
 It was started because of a guy named Trevor Green.

3:52:00.120 --> 3:52:06.040
 He was a Canadian soldier who deployed and he was, so Captain Trevor Green, sorry Trevor,

3:52:06.040 --> 3:52:11.420
 Captain Trevor Green, he got an ax in the middle of his head, a Taliban member came

3:52:11.420 --> 3:52:16.260
 up and put an ax directly into his head when his helmet was off and he survived.

3:52:16.260 --> 3:52:19.420
 He's done work with Invictus Games and Prince Harry.

3:52:19.420 --> 3:52:22.660
 He has an exoskeleton he uses on the island.

3:52:22.660 --> 3:52:23.660
 He's so cool.

3:52:23.660 --> 3:52:29.280
 He hasn't changed one bit from like the infantry captain you expect him to be.

3:52:29.280 --> 3:52:34.980
 And Al saw there was a need for vets and first responders to get treatment because there's

3:52:34.980 --> 3:52:37.780
 no real home away from home for people.

3:52:37.780 --> 3:52:42.600
 Picture Ronald McDonald for cancer and families, this is vets and first responders.

3:52:42.600 --> 3:52:46.040
 And so their whole thing, and I'll read it so I say it exactly right because I used to

3:52:46.040 --> 3:52:50.100
 be on the board of their charity, but I ran out of time, so now I just consult.

3:52:50.100 --> 3:52:55.420
 But they are a home away from home for members of the Canadian Armed Forces, veterans and

3:52:55.420 --> 3:53:00.440
 first responders and their families to stay completely free of charge while they're receiving

3:53:00.440 --> 3:53:03.640
 medical care and treatment in the Vancouver area.

3:53:03.640 --> 3:53:08.080
 But since then, they've expanded since I've come on board and they've opened Honour Ranch,

3:53:08.080 --> 3:53:14.000
 which is up in Ashcroft, BC and it's 140 acres, 10 cabins and a main cabin.

3:53:14.000 --> 3:53:18.080
 They do equine therapy and they're more focused on operational stress injury clinic.

3:53:18.080 --> 3:53:22.340
 So sorry, operational stress injury within the veteran community.

3:53:22.340 --> 3:53:25.320
 And they have specialists that do that.

3:53:25.320 --> 3:53:27.180
 They have their own bracelet with us.

3:53:27.180 --> 3:53:30.280
 So every time you buy an Honour House bracelet, all the proceeds go to them.

3:53:30.280 --> 3:53:33.760
 And it's actually the green one.

3:53:33.760 --> 3:53:34.760
 So that one.

3:53:34.760 --> 3:53:37.960
 So when you buy one of those Honour House bracelets, they have those.

3:53:37.960 --> 3:53:41.260
 They go directly to them, which is really amazing.

3:53:41.260 --> 3:53:44.600
 They've been near and dear to my heart for a long time.

3:53:44.600 --> 3:53:49.120
 You've got the All Secure Foundation, which is these guys are these guys are super dope.

3:53:49.120 --> 3:53:50.900
 I'm going to read exactly because Jen text me.

3:53:50.900 --> 3:53:54.860
 So Jen and Tom Satterly, I've had them both on the podcast.

3:53:54.860 --> 3:53:58.080
 Tom was involved in Black Hawk Down.

3:53:58.080 --> 3:53:59.080
 Tom is a Delta.

3:53:59.080 --> 3:54:00.080
 Have you heard of them?

3:54:00.080 --> 3:54:01.080
 No.

3:54:01.080 --> 3:54:02.080
 No.

3:54:02.080 --> 3:54:03.080
 No.

3:54:03.080 --> 3:54:04.080
 So, okay.

3:54:04.080 --> 3:54:05.080
 So Tom was involved in Black Hawk Down.

3:54:05.080 --> 3:54:06.560
 It was one of his first operations.

3:54:06.560 --> 3:54:08.360
 He's a Delta operator.

3:54:08.360 --> 3:54:11.080
 And I asked her, I said, listen, I'm going to be doing these shows and I think it's great

3:54:11.080 --> 3:54:12.200
 that we talk about you more.

3:54:12.200 --> 3:54:15.520
 So I said, give me your three points of importance.

3:54:15.520 --> 3:54:20.100
 So the All Secure Foundation serves special operations combat families in healing from

3:54:20.100 --> 3:54:23.380
 post traumatic stress injury and secondary post traumatic stress.

3:54:23.380 --> 3:54:27.680
 So that's often what the wife or the other husband or the other spouse suffers from.

3:54:27.680 --> 3:54:31.260
 And we're starting to see that be more and more of an issue now.

3:54:31.260 --> 3:54:35.240
 So they also are devoted to rebuilding the couple's relationships on the home front after

3:54:35.240 --> 3:54:36.660
 the separations of war.

3:54:36.660 --> 3:54:45.160
 And 80% of their warriors want their families to be more involved in the healing.

3:54:45.160 --> 3:54:51.480
 The problem is, is very often vets don't realize that they can have, or just because the system

3:54:51.480 --> 3:54:54.600
 doesn't pay for it, actually have their spouse as a part of things.

3:54:54.600 --> 3:54:57.840
 And the biggest thing that we find with special operations families, I think the divorce rate

3:54:57.840 --> 3:55:00.360
 is like 95%.

3:55:00.360 --> 3:55:03.340
 And so they work so hard with these families.

3:55:03.340 --> 3:55:06.480
 They take them on retreats, these husband and wives, and they get them to connect again

3:55:06.480 --> 3:55:09.700
 after being separated over such a long period of time.

3:55:09.700 --> 3:55:14.880
 There's other places like Children of Fallen Patriots out of DC, where they fund education,

3:55:14.880 --> 3:55:20.080
 university for people who have lost their parents in deployments, whether their kid's

3:55:20.080 --> 3:55:21.080
 even born yet.

3:55:21.080 --> 3:55:23.040
 If they're still in utero, they still pay.

3:55:23.040 --> 3:55:24.040
 They do not care.

3:55:24.040 --> 3:55:30.200
 Then you've got people like in Canada, you've got Vets Canada, you've got in the States,

3:55:30.200 --> 3:55:35.920
 you've got True Patriot Love, you've got, who else in the States is really great that

3:55:35.920 --> 3:55:36.920
 we've worked with.

3:55:36.920 --> 3:55:39.200
 I know there's a Green Beret Foundation that's great.

3:55:39.200 --> 3:55:44.080
 One More Wave gives amputees, teaches them to surf with amputees.

3:55:44.080 --> 3:55:45.260
 They're really great.

3:55:45.260 --> 3:55:46.980
 There's so many organizations.

3:55:46.980 --> 3:55:55.240
 But at the end of the day, I focus on a small subset because you cannot fix everyone's problems.

3:55:55.240 --> 3:55:57.960
 The least you can do for people is focus.

3:55:57.960 --> 3:56:01.360
 If you can provide focus, you can provide the proper amount of funding.

3:56:01.360 --> 3:56:03.720
 Proper amount of funding can get the proper amount of tools.

3:56:03.720 --> 3:56:08.700
 Those tools can actually be implemented properly and then those people can go on to hopefully

3:56:08.700 --> 3:56:14.000
 have successful marriages and families and we don't have to watch our parents drink themselves

3:56:14.000 --> 3:56:18.160
 to death and wonder why daddy's yelling at mommy all the time and daddy storms out and

3:56:18.160 --> 3:56:19.160
 leaves.

3:56:19.160 --> 3:56:22.100
 Well, daddy had some shit happen in his life and mommy had some shit happen, but that does

3:56:22.100 --> 3:56:24.480
 not mean that's who they are.

3:56:24.480 --> 3:56:31.880
 And yes, so trauma has completely destructive effects on family and relationships and correcting

3:56:31.880 --> 3:56:34.640
 that as like ripple effects.

3:56:34.640 --> 3:56:38.400
 Oh, just astronomical ripple effects.

3:56:38.400 --> 3:56:44.120
 Because the problem is we are so quick to tell people they're suffering from PTSD.

3:56:44.120 --> 3:56:45.800
 We're so quick to give them drugs.

3:56:45.800 --> 3:56:48.360
 We're so quick to kick them out of the military.

3:56:48.360 --> 3:56:50.300
 We're so quick to let them be homeless on the street.

3:56:50.300 --> 3:56:52.340
 We're so quick to let them fucking kill themselves.

3:56:52.340 --> 3:56:53.340
 We're so quick.

3:56:53.340 --> 3:56:57.440
 And then all of a sudden, when when a politician goes, veteran suicide is an issue, that's

3:56:57.440 --> 3:56:58.680
 when it's a problem.

3:56:58.680 --> 3:57:02.160
 Well, if you prevent the problem from happening in the first place, or you give people the

3:57:02.160 --> 3:57:05.800
 right funding and tools to do the job, you won't have this problem.

3:57:05.800 --> 3:57:14.800
 Do you have advice for young people, think high school students, maybe undergrads, college

3:57:14.800 --> 3:57:21.180
 students about career, life, how to live a life they can be proud of?

3:57:21.180 --> 3:57:25.680
 You've had one heck of a life.

3:57:25.680 --> 3:57:29.360
 Some of them are really cheesy, but they're true.

3:57:29.360 --> 3:57:32.600
 Live a life you can be proud of, number one.

3:57:32.600 --> 3:57:37.560
 If you wake up every morning and you hate what you do, change the fucking station.

3:57:37.560 --> 3:57:41.440
 Do not live and stay in that perpetual cycle of bullshit.

3:57:41.440 --> 3:57:42.440
 It's not worth it.

3:57:42.440 --> 3:57:43.440
 It's not.

3:57:43.440 --> 3:57:45.920
 It's not what you're on this planet for.

3:57:45.920 --> 3:57:51.120
 You're worth more than that, than the monotony of waking up, going to work, hating your life,

3:57:51.120 --> 3:57:54.160
 drinking yourself to sleep, and functioning.

3:57:54.160 --> 3:57:55.220
 Do yourself a favor.

3:57:55.220 --> 3:58:00.820
 The thing I scream about on the show so much is move your fucking body.

3:58:00.820 --> 3:58:02.720
 Move your body.

3:58:02.720 --> 3:58:04.480
 Get your blood moving.

3:58:04.480 --> 3:58:07.440
 Allow your body to do what it's here for.

3:58:07.440 --> 3:58:08.440
 Go for a run.

3:58:08.440 --> 3:58:09.440
 Go for a walk.

3:58:09.440 --> 3:58:13.800
 If you can't run, walk to the fridge three times more than maybe you did before, but

3:58:13.800 --> 3:58:15.480
 you're moving.

3:58:15.480 --> 3:58:20.000
 Pay attention to the shit you look at.

3:58:20.000 --> 3:58:25.880
 More now than ever, we are seeing our younger generation just be force fed information from

3:58:25.880 --> 3:58:28.720
 one side or the other, and none of it makes sense.

3:58:28.720 --> 3:58:29.800
 None of it's understandable.

3:58:29.800 --> 3:58:32.960
 It just causes chaos in the brain.

3:58:32.960 --> 3:58:36.880
 Really pay attention to what you listen to.

3:58:36.880 --> 3:58:42.360
 Something I've had to learn to do is make time for myself.

3:58:42.360 --> 3:58:47.280
 All of this working 18 hours a day, not sleeping, just work, work, work.

3:58:47.280 --> 3:58:48.280
 That doesn't work.

3:58:48.280 --> 3:58:49.280
 That's not sustainable.

3:58:49.280 --> 3:58:50.280
 That's not healthy.

3:58:50.280 --> 3:58:52.680
 And it's not anything anyone should be doing.

3:58:52.680 --> 3:58:55.360
 Balance is important.

3:58:55.360 --> 3:59:00.760
 But if you're going to take the time to do something for yourself, don't make it sitting

3:59:00.760 --> 3:59:05.120
 in front of the TV for six hours, eating a bag of chips, drinking a Coke.

3:59:05.120 --> 3:59:09.960
 Make it, I'm going to go for a walk, maybe listen to a podcast where I can learn something.

3:59:09.960 --> 3:59:12.520
 Make it, I'm going to go volunteer somewhere.

3:59:12.520 --> 3:59:15.320
 Nobody does that anymore, but make it I can go volunteer somewhere.

3:59:15.320 --> 3:59:18.120
 Honor House, they have no paid employees.

3:59:18.120 --> 3:59:20.600
 They have one, everybody is a volunteer.

3:59:20.600 --> 3:59:23.240
 They're fucking phenomenal.

3:59:23.240 --> 3:59:26.040
 Just do whatever you're going to do.

3:59:26.040 --> 3:59:31.460
 Do it with some fucking drive, put some goddamn effort into your life and pick something in

3:59:31.460 --> 3:59:34.460
 a career that's going to make you happy.

3:59:34.460 --> 3:59:36.960
 Not something that's just going to give you six figures because that's not going to make

3:59:36.960 --> 3:59:37.960
 you happy.

3:59:37.960 --> 3:59:41.280
 I can tell you right now, I have everything in the world and the last thing I want is

3:59:41.280 --> 3:59:42.320
 more things.

3:59:42.320 --> 3:59:43.320
 I want less.

3:59:43.320 --> 3:59:48.160
 I want the woods and I want quiet because that's what's important to me.

3:59:48.160 --> 3:59:53.920
 I want my family to matter, the people around me to matter, and the small group I keep,

3:59:53.920 --> 3:59:58.640
 that tight knit I have, I want them to wake up every minute knowing that they have a friend

3:59:58.640 --> 4:00:01.940
 that they can call on the other line that isn't just like, how's it going?

4:00:01.940 --> 4:00:09.800
 That can actually have a conversation, a meaningful, intelligent, caring conversation.

4:00:09.800 --> 4:00:16.480
 We are just breeding these kids to be followers who digest bullshit, who reverberate things

4:00:16.480 --> 4:00:22.160
 they don't fully understand and have opinions on stuff they have no business talking about.

4:00:22.160 --> 4:00:29.200
 Yeah, with an open mind, humbly think deeply about the world.

4:00:29.200 --> 4:00:32.780
 How has your relationship with death changed?

4:00:32.780 --> 4:00:36.180
 This is a Russian program, I have to ask you.

4:00:36.180 --> 4:00:38.720
 So you've considered suicide throughout your life.

4:00:38.720 --> 4:00:43.120
 You have been in the line of fire, you have witnessed death.

4:00:43.120 --> 4:00:50.400
 You as a human being, a mortal one, do you think about your death these days now that

4:00:50.400 --> 4:00:55.500
 you have begun the journey with dealing with your trauma?

4:00:55.500 --> 4:00:57.960
 Do you think about your death?

4:00:57.960 --> 4:01:01.400
 Are you afraid of your death?

4:01:01.400 --> 4:01:02.960
 Well you don't die, so that's why.

4:01:02.960 --> 4:01:05.380
 What do you mean you don't die?

4:01:05.380 --> 4:01:06.380
 You move on.

4:01:06.380 --> 4:01:08.640
 Where do you go?

4:01:08.640 --> 4:01:13.480
 To another plane, and another vibration, and another whatever you want to call it.

4:01:13.480 --> 4:01:14.480
 This isn't it.

4:01:14.480 --> 4:01:16.000
 This isn't all of it.

4:01:16.000 --> 4:01:17.420
 This is a blip.

4:01:17.420 --> 4:01:18.640
 This is a moment.

4:01:18.640 --> 4:01:19.640
 This is a...

4:01:19.640 --> 4:01:22.760
 I used to be afraid of death before the military.

4:01:22.760 --> 4:01:24.560
 I was always afraid of dying.

4:01:24.560 --> 4:01:25.560
 I don't know why.

4:01:25.560 --> 4:01:29.400
 I had this irrational fear that I was going to be kidnapped in my room, like seriously,

4:01:29.400 --> 4:01:30.960
 like irrational fear, like afraid.

4:01:30.960 --> 4:01:37.000
 And it's funny because I talked to Michaela yesterday and she said the same thing and

4:01:37.000 --> 4:01:39.760
 I was like, oh my God, I know what you're talking about.

4:01:39.760 --> 4:01:41.000
 Being afraid of being kidnapped?

4:01:41.000 --> 4:01:45.760
 Yeah, she had this fear that someone was going to come in and take her out of her room.

4:01:45.760 --> 4:01:46.760
 I had the same fear.

4:01:46.760 --> 4:01:49.080
 By a human being or a monster of some kind?

4:01:49.080 --> 4:01:50.440
 No, I think like by a human being.

4:01:50.440 --> 4:01:54.980
 And I had this irrational fear that something was going to happen to me.

4:01:54.980 --> 4:01:57.760
 And like I said, I don't know if it was because my parents were always made me aware of my

4:01:57.760 --> 4:01:58.760
 surroundings.

4:01:58.760 --> 4:01:59.760
 People take people.

4:01:59.760 --> 4:02:01.320
 This is a real thing that happens.

4:02:01.320 --> 4:02:03.820
 I was really small and I looked like a little boy.

4:02:03.820 --> 4:02:06.120
 My hair was like that when I was training.

4:02:06.120 --> 4:02:08.760
 I had short, no hair, flat as a board.

4:02:08.760 --> 4:02:11.000
 You would have thought I was a 12 year old boy.

4:02:11.000 --> 4:02:14.880
 And so my mom's like, people take people, sweetie, that's just the reality of life.

4:02:14.880 --> 4:02:15.880
 You need to be aware.

4:02:15.880 --> 4:02:18.080
 So I don't know if I had this ingrained in my mind.

4:02:18.080 --> 4:02:21.640
 I was always like training to protect myself or fight someone off.

4:02:21.640 --> 4:02:25.320
 So I was like afraid of like this irrational thing.

4:02:25.320 --> 4:02:28.880
 And then I went overseas and then I realized that I could just be literally there talking

4:02:28.880 --> 4:02:32.200
 to you, having a conversation, and I could just be taken off the face of the earth.

4:02:32.200 --> 4:02:34.760
 And there's nothing I can do about it.

4:02:34.760 --> 4:02:37.760
 And then I adopted this idea that when it's my time, it'll be my time.

4:02:37.760 --> 4:02:50.400
 But the difference is now, at least I know that if I do go and I do cross and I am and

4:02:50.400 --> 4:02:59.320
 I do move on, I know that I live my life the way that I always hoped I would be proud to

4:02:59.320 --> 4:03:00.320
 live.

4:03:00.320 --> 4:03:08.360
 Can I ask you a dark question because we, you mentioned Robin Williams, you mentioned

4:03:08.360 --> 4:03:12.280
 Anthony Bourdain and your own struggle with suicide.

4:03:12.280 --> 4:03:18.120
 Why do you think they ultimately lost the battle, that battle?

4:03:18.120 --> 4:03:19.520
 Why do you think they took their lives?

4:03:19.520 --> 4:03:25.800
 Man, that's a, that's a loaded question because you could look at everything from, from biomarkers

4:03:25.800 --> 4:03:30.000
 in the brain to know if their serotonin and dopamine levels were crashed in the ground.

4:03:30.000 --> 4:03:35.520
 Like there's, there's biological reasonings for some people where they're born bipolar

4:03:35.520 --> 4:03:40.760
 and they have, or, you know, they're schizophrenic, like there's so many things we don't fully

4:03:40.760 --> 4:03:43.800
 grasp about the brain.

4:03:43.800 --> 4:03:52.960
 But what we do know from my perspective, for me at least, there really is no rhyme or reason

4:03:52.960 --> 4:03:56.880
 why I survived and others didn't.

4:03:56.880 --> 4:03:59.520
 Stuff and things don't make you happy.

4:03:59.520 --> 4:04:05.240
 People don't always know why they're feeling the way they're feeling, but they also are,

4:04:05.240 --> 4:04:15.160
 also are not always willing to talk about it or be, they put on a good front.

4:04:15.160 --> 4:04:18.400
 And if nobody knows any different, what do you expect?

4:04:18.400 --> 4:04:24.240
 And it's especially clear with the, the two of them that on the surface they're, you know,

4:04:24.240 --> 4:04:29.160
 exceptionally successful in so many dimensions and still that means nothing.

4:04:29.160 --> 4:04:36.080
 Well possessions, anything really is not, doesn't guarantee you happiness.

4:04:36.080 --> 4:04:38.840
 No, it doesn't.

4:04:38.840 --> 4:04:49.120
 Well that's terrifying, but when it's good, that's what makes it joyful.

4:04:49.120 --> 4:04:54.840
 Like that's what happiness is, is like holy shit somehow amidst all the absurdity, all

4:04:54.840 --> 4:04:59.040
 the things that you can't predict, you, you nevertheless feel really good.

4:04:59.040 --> 4:05:05.080
 That's why I feel really fortunate to be getting this feat of happiness all the time.

4:05:05.080 --> 4:05:10.160
 Well to be or not to be, that's a good place to end it.

4:05:10.160 --> 4:05:13.200
 Kelsey, you're an amazing human being.

4:05:13.200 --> 4:05:18.080
 I'm really fortunate that you would spend your valuable time with me.

4:05:18.080 --> 4:05:23.360
 As I said, you're so good at not just talking, but listening.

4:05:23.360 --> 4:05:27.880
 So I definitely will listen to your podcast because I can tell you're an incredible person

4:05:27.880 --> 4:05:30.920
 as an interviewer and as a storyteller.

4:05:30.920 --> 4:05:33.640
 So again, thank you for talking today.

4:05:33.640 --> 4:05:36.640
 Thank you so much, bye.

4:05:36.640 --> 4:05:39.280
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Kelsey Sharon.

4:05:39.280 --> 4:05:43.280
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

4:05:43.280 --> 4:05:47.720
 And now let me leave you with some words from Herbert Hoover.

4:05:47.720 --> 4:05:54.640
 Older men declare war, but it is the youth that must fight and die.

4:05:54.640 --> 4:05:57.960
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
