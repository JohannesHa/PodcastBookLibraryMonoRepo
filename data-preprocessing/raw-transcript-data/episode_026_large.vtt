00:00.000 --> 00:02.700
 The following is a conversation with Sean Carroll.

00:02.700 --> 00:04.900
 He's a theoretical physicist at Caltech

00:04.900 --> 00:08.780
 specializing in quantum mechanics, gravity, and cosmology.

00:08.780 --> 00:11.620
 He's the author of several popular books,

00:11.620 --> 00:15.340
 one on the arrow of time called From Eternity to Here,

00:15.340 --> 00:17.820
 one on the Higgs boson called Particle

00:17.820 --> 00:19.140
 at the End of the Universe,

00:19.140 --> 00:22.540
 and one on science and philosophy called The Big Picture

00:22.540 --> 00:26.340
 on the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself.

00:26.340 --> 00:28.700
 He has an upcoming book on quantum mechanics

00:28.700 --> 00:32.660
 that you can preorder now called Something Deeply Hidden.

00:32.660 --> 00:36.060
 He writes one of my favorite blogs on his website,

00:36.060 --> 00:37.980
 preposterousuniverse.com.

00:37.980 --> 00:40.460
 I recommend clicking on the Greatest Hits link

00:40.460 --> 00:43.340
 that lists accessible, interesting posts

00:43.340 --> 00:45.660
 on the arrow of time, dark matter, dark energy,

00:45.660 --> 00:47.620
 the Big Bang, general relativity,

00:47.620 --> 00:49.580
 string theory, quantum mechanics,

00:49.580 --> 00:53.180
 and the big meta questions about the philosophy of science,

00:53.180 --> 00:57.620
 God, ethics, politics, academia, and much, much more.

00:57.620 --> 01:00.300
 Finally, and perhaps most famously,

01:00.300 --> 01:03.660
 he's the host of a podcast called Mindscape

01:03.660 --> 01:06.940
 that you should subscribe to and support on Patreon.

01:06.940 --> 01:08.820
 Along with the Joe Rogan experience,

01:08.820 --> 01:10.500
 Sam Harris's Making Sense,

01:10.500 --> 01:13.100
 and Dan Carlin's Hardcore History,

01:13.100 --> 01:15.860
 Sean's Mindscape podcast is one of my favorite ways

01:15.860 --> 01:18.820
 to learn new ideas or explore different perspectives

01:18.820 --> 01:22.140
 and ideas that I thought I understood.

01:22.140 --> 01:24.660
 It was truly an honor to meet

01:24.660 --> 01:27.240
 and spend a couple hours with Sean.

01:27.240 --> 01:28.980
 It's a bit heartbreaking to say

01:28.980 --> 01:30.540
 that for the first time ever,

01:30.540 --> 01:32.500
 the audio recorder for this podcast

01:32.500 --> 01:34.940
 died in the middle of our conversation.

01:34.940 --> 01:36.320
 There's technical reasons for this,

01:36.320 --> 01:38.380
 having to do with phantom power

01:38.380 --> 01:41.060
 that I now understand and will avoid.

01:41.060 --> 01:44.220
 It took me one hour to notice and fix the problem.

01:44.220 --> 01:48.340
 So, much like the universe is 68% dark energy,

01:48.340 --> 01:51.340
 roughly the same amount from this conversation was lost,

01:51.340 --> 01:54.220
 except in the memories of the two people involved

01:54.220 --> 01:56.320
 and in my notes.

01:56.320 --> 01:59.940
 I'm sure we'll talk again and continue this conversation

01:59.940 --> 02:02.420
 on this podcast or on Sean's.

02:02.420 --> 02:05.300
 And of course, I look forward to it.

02:05.300 --> 02:07.820
 This is the Artificial Intelligence podcast.

02:07.820 --> 02:11.060
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes,

02:11.060 --> 02:12.520
 support it on Patreon,

02:12.520 --> 02:16.660
 or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.

02:16.660 --> 02:21.380
 And now, here's my conversation with Sean Carroll.

02:21.380 --> 02:23.540
 What do you think is more interesting and impactful,

02:23.540 --> 02:26.860
 understanding how the universe works at a fundamental level

02:26.860 --> 02:29.180
 or understanding how the human mind works?

02:29.180 --> 02:31.960
 You know, of course this is a crazy,

02:31.960 --> 02:33.940
 meaningless, unanswerable question in some sense,

02:33.940 --> 02:35.140
 because they're both very interesting

02:35.140 --> 02:37.500
 and there's no absolute scale of interestingness

02:37.500 --> 02:39.180
 that we can rate them on.

02:39.180 --> 02:41.140
 There's a glib answer that says the human brain

02:41.140 --> 02:43.060
 is part of the universe, right?

02:43.060 --> 02:44.420
 And therefore, understanding the universe

02:44.420 --> 02:47.020
 is more fundamental than understanding the human brain.

02:47.020 --> 02:49.580
 But do you really believe that once we understand

02:49.580 --> 02:51.500
 the fundamental way the universe works

02:51.500 --> 02:53.740
 at the particle level, the forces,

02:53.740 --> 02:55.820
 we would be able to understand how the mind works?

02:55.820 --> 02:56.660
 No, certainly not.

02:56.660 --> 02:58.740
 We cannot understand how ice cream works

02:58.740 --> 03:01.060
 just from understanding how particles work, right?

03:01.060 --> 03:02.740
 So I'm a big believer in emergence.

03:02.740 --> 03:05.300
 I'm a big believer that there are different ways

03:05.300 --> 03:06.660
 of talking about the world

03:07.900 --> 03:11.180
 beyond just the most fundamental microscopic one.

03:11.180 --> 03:13.860
 You know, when we talk about tables and chairs

03:13.860 --> 03:15.120
 and planets and people,

03:15.120 --> 03:17.300
 we're not talking the language of particle physics

03:17.300 --> 03:18.380
 and cosmology.

03:18.380 --> 03:20.860
 So, but understanding the universe,

03:20.860 --> 03:24.060
 you didn't say just at the most fundamental level, right?

03:24.060 --> 03:26.740
 So understanding the universe at all levels

03:26.740 --> 03:28.200
 is part of that.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.940
 I do think, you know, to be a little bit more fair

03:29.940 --> 03:33.980
 to the question, there probably are general principles

03:33.980 --> 03:38.500
 of complexity, biology, information processing,

03:38.500 --> 03:41.820
 memory, knowledge, creativity

03:41.820 --> 03:45.620
 that go beyond just the human brain, right?

03:45.620 --> 03:47.800
 And maybe one could count understanding those

03:47.800 --> 03:49.140
 as part of understanding the universe.

03:49.140 --> 03:50.480
 The human brain, as far as we know,

03:50.480 --> 03:54.300
 is the most complex thing in the universe.

03:54.300 --> 03:57.420
 So there's, it's certainly absurd to think

03:57.420 --> 03:58.860
 that by understanding the fundamental laws

03:58.860 --> 04:00.340
 of particle physics,

04:00.340 --> 04:02.860
 you get any direct insight on how the brain works.

04:02.860 --> 04:05.940
 But then there's this step from the fundamentals

04:05.940 --> 04:08.700
 of particle physics to information processing,

04:08.700 --> 04:10.820
 which a lot of physicists and philosophers

04:10.820 --> 04:12.460
 may be a little bit carelessly take

04:12.460 --> 04:14.620
 when they talk about artificial intelligence.

04:14.620 --> 04:18.020
 Do you think of the universe

04:18.020 --> 04:21.300
 as a kind of a computational device?

04:21.300 --> 04:24.140
 No, to be like, the honest answer there is no.

04:24.140 --> 04:26.300
 There's a sense in which the universe

04:26.300 --> 04:29.140
 processes information, clearly.

04:29.140 --> 04:30.700
 There's a sense in which the universe

04:30.700 --> 04:33.880
 is like a computer, clearly.

04:33.880 --> 04:36.500
 But in some sense, I think,

04:36.500 --> 04:38.540
 I tried to say this once on my blog

04:38.540 --> 04:39.360
 and no one agreed with me,

04:39.360 --> 04:42.360
 but the universe is more like a computation

04:42.360 --> 04:45.060
 than a computer because the universe happens once.

04:45.060 --> 04:46.900
 A computer is a general purpose machine, right?

04:46.900 --> 04:48.700
 That you can ask it different questions,

04:48.700 --> 04:50.140
 even a pocket calculator, right?

04:50.140 --> 04:52.980
 And it's set up to answer certain kinds of questions.

04:52.980 --> 04:54.340
 The universe isn't that.

04:54.340 --> 04:57.360
 So information processing happens in the universe,

04:57.360 --> 04:59.220
 but it's not what the universe is.

04:59.220 --> 05:01.580
 And I know your MIT colleague, Seth Lloyd,

05:01.580 --> 05:03.820
 feels very differently about this, right?

05:03.820 --> 05:07.220
 Well, you're thinking of the universe as a closed system.

05:07.220 --> 05:08.060
 I am.

05:08.060 --> 05:11.780
 So what makes a computer more like a PC,

05:12.980 --> 05:15.500
 like a computing machine is that there's a human

05:15.500 --> 05:19.100
 that every once comes up to it and moves the mouse around.

05:19.100 --> 05:19.940
 So input.

05:19.940 --> 05:20.760
 Gives it input.

05:20.760 --> 05:21.600
 Gives it input.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.300
 And that's why you're saying it's just a computation,

05:26.300 --> 05:29.260
 a deterministic thing that's just unrolling.

05:29.260 --> 05:32.220
 But the immense complexity of it

05:32.220 --> 05:34.420
 is nevertheless like processing.

05:34.420 --> 05:39.420
 There's a state and then it changes with good rules.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.660
 And there's a sense for a lot of people

05:41.660 --> 05:44.420
 that if the brain operates,

05:44.420 --> 05:46.460
 the human brain operates within that world,

05:46.460 --> 05:49.340
 then it's simply just a small subset of that.

05:49.340 --> 05:52.500
 And so there's no reason we can't build

05:52.500 --> 05:55.560
 arbitrarily great intelligences.

05:55.560 --> 05:56.400
 Yeah.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.660
 Do you think of intelligence in this way?

05:58.660 --> 05:59.580
 Intelligence is tricky.

05:59.580 --> 06:01.660
 I don't have a definition of it offhand.

06:01.660 --> 06:05.460
 So I remember this panel discussion that I saw on YouTube.

06:05.460 --> 06:07.620
 I wasn't there, but Seth Lloyd was on the panel.

06:07.620 --> 06:10.540
 And so was Martin Rees, the famous astrophysicist.

06:10.540 --> 06:13.780
 And Seth gave his shtick for why the universe is a computer

06:13.780 --> 06:14.820
 and explained this.

06:14.820 --> 06:19.140
 And Martin Rees said, so what is not a computer?

06:19.140 --> 06:22.000
 And Seth was like, oh, that's a good question.

06:22.000 --> 06:22.840
 I'm not sure.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.960
 Because if you have a sufficiently broad definition

06:24.960 --> 06:28.360
 of what a computer is, then everything is, right?

06:28.360 --> 06:32.140
 And the simile or the analogy gains force

06:32.140 --> 06:34.380
 when it excludes some things.

06:34.380 --> 06:36.260
 You know, is the moon going around the earth

06:36.260 --> 06:38.620
 performing a computation?

06:38.620 --> 06:41.320
 I can come up with definitions in which the answer is yes,

06:41.320 --> 06:43.820
 but it's not a very useful computation.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.140
 I think that it's absolutely helpful

06:46.140 --> 06:49.620
 to think about the universe in certain situations,

06:49.620 --> 06:53.020
 certain contexts, as an information processing device.

06:53.020 --> 06:54.860
 I'm even guilty of writing a paper

06:54.860 --> 06:56.820
 called Quantum Circuit Cosmology,

06:56.820 --> 06:59.260
 where we modeled the whole universe as a quantum circuit.

06:59.260 --> 07:00.100
 As a circuit.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.340
 As a circuit, yeah.

07:01.340 --> 07:02.860
 With qubits kind of thing?

07:02.860 --> 07:05.040
 With qubits basically, right, yeah.

07:05.040 --> 07:07.440
 So, and qubits becoming more and more entangled.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.660
 So do we wanna digress a little bit?

07:09.660 --> 07:10.500
 Let's do it.

07:10.500 --> 07:11.340
 It's kind of fun.

07:11.340 --> 07:13.700
 So here's a mystery about the universe

07:13.700 --> 07:16.880
 that is so deep and profound that nobody talks about it.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.080
 Space expands, right?

07:19.080 --> 07:21.940
 And we talk about, in a certain region of space,

07:21.940 --> 07:23.620
 a certain number of degrees of freedom,

07:23.620 --> 07:25.540
 a certain number of ways that the quantum fields

07:25.540 --> 07:28.800
 and the particles in that region can arrange themselves.

07:28.800 --> 07:32.220
 That number of degrees of freedom in a region of space

07:32.220 --> 07:33.820
 is arguably finite.

07:33.820 --> 07:36.660
 We actually don't know how many there are,

07:36.660 --> 07:37.820
 but there's a very good argument

07:37.820 --> 07:39.420
 that says it's a finite number.

07:39.420 --> 07:43.540
 So as the universe expands and space gets bigger,

07:44.900 --> 07:46.780
 are there more degrees of freedom?

07:46.780 --> 07:48.540
 If it's an infinite number, it doesn't really matter.

07:48.540 --> 07:49.980
 Infinity times two is still infinity.

07:49.980 --> 07:53.480
 But if it's a finite number, then there's more space,

07:53.480 --> 07:54.420
 so there's more degrees of freedom.

07:54.420 --> 07:55.740
 So where did they come from?

07:55.740 --> 07:58.020
 That would mean the universe is not a closed system.

07:58.020 --> 08:01.500
 There's more degrees of freedom popping into existence.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.460
 So what we suggested was

08:03.460 --> 08:05.340
 that there are more degrees of freedom,

08:05.340 --> 08:07.980
 and it's not that they're not there to start,

08:07.980 --> 08:10.860
 but they're not entangled to start.

08:10.860 --> 08:12.820
 So the universe that you and I know of,

08:12.820 --> 08:15.440
 the three dimensions around us that we see,

08:15.440 --> 08:18.100
 we said those are the entangled degrees of freedom

08:18.100 --> 08:19.620
 making up space time.

08:19.620 --> 08:20.920
 And as the universe expands,

08:20.920 --> 08:25.180
 there are a whole bunch of qubits in their zero state

08:25.180 --> 08:28.140
 that become entangled with the rest of space time

08:28.140 --> 08:31.180
 through the action of these quantum circuits.

08:31.180 --> 08:35.580
 So what does it mean that there's now more

08:35.580 --> 08:39.300
 degrees of freedom as they become more entangled?

08:39.300 --> 08:40.300
 Yeah, so.

08:40.300 --> 08:41.660
 As the universe expands.

08:41.660 --> 08:43.300
 That's right, so there's more and more degrees of freedom

08:43.300 --> 08:46.420
 that are entangled, that are playing part,

08:46.420 --> 08:47.360
 playing the role of part

08:47.360 --> 08:49.600
 of the entangled space time structure.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.980
 So the basic, the underlying philosophy is

08:51.980 --> 08:54.620
 that space time itself arises from the entanglement

08:54.620 --> 08:57.560
 of some fundamental quantum degrees of freedom.

08:57.560 --> 09:00.820
 Wow, okay, so at which point

09:00.820 --> 09:05.260
 is most of the entanglement happening?

09:05.260 --> 09:07.460
 Are we talking about close to the Big Bang?

09:07.460 --> 09:11.820
 Are we talking about throughout the time of the life?

09:11.820 --> 09:12.660
 Throughout history, yeah.

09:12.660 --> 09:15.140
 So the idea is that at the Big Bang,

09:15.140 --> 09:16.780
 almost all the degrees of freedom

09:16.780 --> 09:19.700
 that the universe could have were there,

09:19.700 --> 09:22.420
 but they were unentangled with anything else.

09:22.420 --> 09:23.900
 And that's a reflection of the fact

09:23.900 --> 09:25.620
 that the Big Bang had a low entropy.

09:25.620 --> 09:28.020
 It was a very simple, very small place.

09:28.020 --> 09:31.420
 And as space expands, more and more degrees of freedom

09:31.420 --> 09:34.300
 become entangled with the rest of the world.

09:34.300 --> 09:35.940
 Well, I have to ask John Carroll,

09:35.940 --> 09:37.880
 what do you think of the thought experiment

09:37.880 --> 09:41.580
 from Nick Bostrom that we're living in a simulation?

09:41.580 --> 09:44.980
 So I think, let me contextualize that a little bit more.

09:44.980 --> 09:48.340
 I think people don't actually take this thought experiments.

09:48.340 --> 09:50.460
 I think it's quite interesting.

09:50.460 --> 09:52.900
 It's not very useful, but it's quite interesting.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.500
 From the perspective of AI,

09:54.500 --> 09:58.020
 a lot of the learning that can be done usually happens

09:58.020 --> 10:00.580
 in simulation from artificial examples.

10:00.580 --> 10:03.840
 And so it's a constructive question to ask,

10:04.900 --> 10:08.240
 how difficult is our real world to simulate?

10:08.240 --> 10:09.360
 Right.

10:09.360 --> 10:12.180
 Which is kind of a dual part of,

10:12.180 --> 10:14.100
 if we're living in a simulation

10:14.100 --> 10:16.420
 and somebody built that simulation,

10:16.420 --> 10:18.860
 if you were to try to do it yourself, how hard would it be?

10:18.860 --> 10:21.100
 So obviously we could be living in a simulation.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.000
 If you just want the physical possibility,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.420
 then I completely agree that it's physically possible.

10:25.420 --> 10:27.380
 I don't think that we actually are.

10:27.380 --> 10:30.300
 So take this one piece of data into consideration.

10:30.300 --> 10:33.960
 You know, we live in a big universe, okay?

10:35.140 --> 10:38.500
 There's two trillion galaxies in our observable universe

10:38.500 --> 10:41.660
 with 200 billion stars in each galaxy, et cetera.

10:41.660 --> 10:44.940
 It would seem to be a waste of resources

10:44.940 --> 10:46.540
 to have a universe that big going on

10:46.540 --> 10:47.540
 just to do a simulation.

10:47.540 --> 10:50.140
 So in other words, I want to be a good Bayesian.

10:50.140 --> 10:52.940
 I want to ask under this hypothesis,

10:52.940 --> 10:54.960
 what do I expect to see?

10:54.960 --> 10:56.780
 So the first thing I would say is I wouldn't expect

10:56.780 --> 11:00.340
 to see a universe that was that big, okay?

11:00.340 --> 11:02.540
 The second thing is I wouldn't expect the resolution

11:02.540 --> 11:05.020
 of the universe to be as good as it is.

11:05.020 --> 11:08.740
 So it's always possible that if our superhuman simulators

11:08.740 --> 11:09.900
 only have finite resources,

11:09.900 --> 11:12.420
 that they don't render the entire universe, right?

11:12.420 --> 11:14.340
 That the part that is out there,

11:14.340 --> 11:16.300
 the two trillion galaxies,

11:16.300 --> 11:19.640
 isn't actually being simulated fully, okay?

11:19.640 --> 11:22.740
 But then the obvious extrapolation of that

11:22.740 --> 11:25.500
 is that only I am being simulated fully.

11:25.500 --> 11:29.220
 Like the rest of you are just non player characters, right?

11:29.220 --> 11:30.520
 I'm the only thing that is real.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.780
 The rest of you are just chat bots.

11:32.780 --> 11:34.320
 Beyond this wall, I see the wall,

11:34.320 --> 11:36.020
 but there is literally nothing

11:36.020 --> 11:37.360
 on the other side of the wall.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.300
 That is sort of the Bayesian prediction.

11:39.300 --> 11:40.180
 That's what it would be like

11:40.180 --> 11:42.240
 to do an efficient simulation of me.

11:42.240 --> 11:45.700
 So like none of that seems quite realistic.

11:45.700 --> 11:50.700
 I don't see, I hear the argument that it's just possible

11:50.900 --> 11:53.300
 and easy to simulate lots of things.

11:53.300 --> 11:55.780
 I don't see any evidence from what we know

11:55.780 --> 11:59.340
 about our universe that we look like a simulated universe.

11:59.340 --> 12:00.180
 Now, maybe you can say,

12:00.180 --> 12:01.980
 well, we don't know what it would look like,

12:01.980 --> 12:04.520
 but that's just abandoning your Bayesian responsibilities.

12:04.520 --> 12:07.660
 Like your job is to say under this theory,

12:07.660 --> 12:09.500
 here's what you would expect to see.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.660
 Yeah, so certainly if you think about simulation

12:11.660 --> 12:14.340
 as a thing that's like a video game

12:14.340 --> 12:17.740
 where only a small subset is being rendered.

12:17.740 --> 12:22.740
 But say the entire, all the laws of physics,

12:22.740 --> 12:26.540
 the entire closed system of the quote unquote universe,

12:26.540 --> 12:27.780
 it had a creator.

12:27.780 --> 12:29.320
 Yeah, it's always possible.

12:29.320 --> 12:32.280
 Right, so that's not useful to think about

12:32.280 --> 12:34.020
 when you're thinking about physics.

12:34.020 --> 12:36.220
 The way Nick Bostrom phrases it,

12:36.220 --> 12:39.100
 if it's possible to simulate a universe,

12:39.100 --> 12:40.500
 eventually we'll do it.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.340
 Right.

12:42.700 --> 12:44.860
 You can use that by the way for a lot of things.

12:44.860 --> 12:45.700
 Well, yeah.

12:45.700 --> 12:48.540
 But I guess the question is,

12:48.540 --> 12:52.340
 how hard is it to create a universe?

12:52.340 --> 12:53.820
 I wrote a little blog post about this

12:53.820 --> 12:55.460
 and maybe I'm missing something,

12:55.460 --> 12:57.680
 but there's an argument that says not only

12:57.680 --> 13:00.500
 that it might be possible to simulate a universe,

13:00.500 --> 13:05.500
 but probably if you imagine that you actually attribute

13:05.980 --> 13:08.860
 consciousness and agency to the little things

13:08.860 --> 13:12.020
 that we're simulating, to our little artificial beings,

13:12.020 --> 13:13.420
 there's probably a lot more of them

13:13.420 --> 13:15.500
 than there are ordinary organic beings in the universe

13:15.500 --> 13:17.420
 or there will be in the future, right?

13:17.420 --> 13:18.500
 So there's an argument that not only

13:18.500 --> 13:20.760
 is being a simulation possible,

13:20.760 --> 13:23.560
 it's probable because in the space

13:23.560 --> 13:24.960
 of all living consciousnesses,

13:24.960 --> 13:26.620
 most of them are being simulated, right?

13:26.620 --> 13:28.860
 Most of them are not at the top level.

13:28.860 --> 13:30.540
 I think that argument must be wrong

13:30.540 --> 13:33.100
 because it follows from that argument that,

13:33.100 --> 13:36.920
 if we're simulated, but we can also simulate other things,

13:36.920 --> 13:38.840
 well, but if we can simulate other things,

13:38.840 --> 13:41.840
 they can simulate other things, right?

13:41.840 --> 13:44.320
 If we give them enough power and resolution

13:44.320 --> 13:45.980
 and ultimately we'll reach a bottom

13:45.980 --> 13:49.140
 because the laws of physics in our universe have a bottom,

13:49.140 --> 13:51.000
 we're made of atoms and so forth,

13:51.000 --> 13:55.100
 so there will be the cheapest possible simulations.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.700
 And if you believe the original argument,

13:57.700 --> 13:59.340
 you should conclude that we should be

13:59.340 --> 14:00.940
 in the cheapest possible simulation

14:00.940 --> 14:02.660
 because that's where most people are.

14:02.660 --> 14:03.620
 But we don't look like that.

14:03.620 --> 14:06.860
 It doesn't look at all like we're at the edge of resolution,

14:06.860 --> 14:09.540
 that we're 16 bit things.

14:09.540 --> 14:13.020
 It seems much easier to make much lower level things

14:13.020 --> 14:13.860
 than we are.

14:14.980 --> 14:18.220
 And also, I questioned the whole approach

14:18.220 --> 14:19.460
 to the anthropic principle

14:19.460 --> 14:22.340
 that says we are typical observers in the universe.

14:22.340 --> 14:23.660
 I think that that's not actually,

14:23.660 --> 14:27.340
 I think that there's a lot of selection that we can do

14:27.340 --> 14:30.180
 that we're typical within things we already know,

14:30.180 --> 14:32.280
 but not typical within all of the universe.

14:32.280 --> 14:35.800
 So do you think there's intelligent life,

14:35.800 --> 14:37.860
 however you would like to define intelligent life,

14:37.860 --> 14:39.940
 out there in the universe?

14:39.940 --> 14:44.660
 My guess is that there is not intelligent life

14:44.660 --> 14:48.820
 in the observable universe other than us, simply

14:48.820 --> 14:52.540
 on the basis of the fact that the likely number

14:52.540 --> 14:56.340
 of other intelligent species in the observable universe,

14:56.340 --> 15:00.320
 there's two likely numbers, zero or billions.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.580
 And if there had been billions,

15:02.580 --> 15:04.140
 you would have noticed already.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.340
 For there to be literally like a small number,

15:07.340 --> 15:09.380
 like, you know, Star Trek,

15:09.380 --> 15:13.300
 there's a dozen intelligent civilizations in our galaxy,

15:13.300 --> 15:17.340
 but not a billion, that's weird.

15:17.340 --> 15:18.500
 That's sort of bizarre to me.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.020
 It's easy for me to imagine that there are zero others

15:21.020 --> 15:22.620
 because there's just a big bottleneck

15:22.620 --> 15:24.980
 to making multicellular life

15:24.980 --> 15:27.020
 or technological life or whatever.

15:27.020 --> 15:28.580
 It's very hard for me to imagine

15:28.580 --> 15:30.140
 that there's a whole bunch out there

15:30.140 --> 15:32.300
 that have somehow remained hidden from us.

15:32.300 --> 15:34.700
 The question I'd like to ask

15:34.700 --> 15:36.820
 is what would intelligent life look like?

15:38.140 --> 15:40.500
 What I mean by that question and where it's going

15:40.500 --> 15:45.500
 is what if intelligent life is just in some very big ways

15:47.260 --> 15:51.500
 different than the one that has on Earth?

15:51.500 --> 15:53.900
 That there's all kinds of intelligent life

15:53.900 --> 15:55.420
 that operates at different scales

15:55.420 --> 15:57.300
 of both size and temporal.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.300
 Right, that's a great possibility

15:59.300 --> 16:00.800
 because I think we should be humble

16:00.800 --> 16:02.640
 about what intelligence is, what life is.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.020
 We don't even agree on what life is,

16:04.020 --> 16:07.020
 much less what intelligent life is, right?

16:07.020 --> 16:08.980
 So that's an argument for humility,

16:08.980 --> 16:10.860
 saying there could be intelligent life

16:10.860 --> 16:13.620
 of a very different character, right?

16:13.620 --> 16:18.060
 Like you could imagine the dolphins are intelligent

16:18.060 --> 16:20.500
 but never invent space travel

16:20.500 --> 16:21.460
 because they live in the ocean

16:21.460 --> 16:23.220
 and they don't have thumbs, right?

16:24.180 --> 16:27.860
 So they never invent technology, they never invent smelting.

16:27.860 --> 16:32.020
 Maybe the universe is full of intelligent species

16:32.020 --> 16:34.060
 that just don't make technology, right?

16:34.060 --> 16:36.320
 That's compatible with the data, I think.

16:36.320 --> 16:39.840
 And I think maybe what you're pointing at

16:39.840 --> 16:44.440
 is even more out there versions of intelligence,

16:44.440 --> 16:47.560
 intelligence in intermolecular clouds

16:47.560 --> 16:49.440
 or on the surface of a neutron star

16:49.440 --> 16:51.760
 or in between the galaxies in giant things

16:51.760 --> 16:54.560
 where the equivalent of a heartbeat is 100 million years.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.080
 On the one hand, yes,

16:58.080 --> 16:59.860
 we should be very open minded about those things.

16:59.860 --> 17:04.860
 On the other hand, all of us share the same laws of physics.

17:04.860 --> 17:08.240
 There might be something about the laws of physics,

17:08.240 --> 17:09.400
 even though we don't currently know

17:09.400 --> 17:10.920
 exactly what that thing would be,

17:10.920 --> 17:15.920
 that makes meters and years

17:16.160 --> 17:18.920
 the right length and timescales for intelligent life.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.240
 Maybe not, but we're made of atoms,

17:22.240 --> 17:23.780
 atoms have a certain size,

17:23.780 --> 17:27.280
 we orbit stars or stars have a certain lifetime.

17:27.280 --> 17:30.300
 It's not impossible to me that there's a sweet spot

17:30.300 --> 17:32.200
 for intelligent life that we find ourselves in.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.800
 So I'm open minded either way,

17:33.800 --> 17:35.280
 I'm open minded either being humble

17:35.280 --> 17:37.080
 and there's all sorts of different kinds of life

17:37.080 --> 17:39.280
 or no, there's a reason we just don't know it yet

17:39.280 --> 17:42.080
 why life like ours is the kind of life that's out there.

17:42.080 --> 17:43.320
 Yeah, I'm of two minds too,

17:43.320 --> 17:47.200
 but I often wonder if our brains is just designed

17:47.200 --> 17:52.200
 to quite obviously to operate and see the world

17:52.720 --> 17:56.360
 in these timescales and we're almost blind

17:56.360 --> 18:01.200
 and the tools we've created for detecting things are blind

18:01.200 --> 18:02.760
 to the kind of observation needed

18:02.760 --> 18:04.920
 to see intelligent life at other scales.

18:04.920 --> 18:07.040
 Well, I'm totally open to that,

18:07.040 --> 18:09.240
 but so here's another argument I would make,

18:09.240 --> 18:11.520
 we have looked for intelligent life,

18:11.520 --> 18:14.120
 but we've looked at for it in the dumbest way we can,

18:14.120 --> 18:16.600
 by turning radio telescopes to the sky.

18:16.600 --> 18:21.040
 And why in the world would a super advanced civilization

18:21.040 --> 18:24.040
 randomly beam out radio signals wastefully

18:24.040 --> 18:25.440
 in all directions into the universe?

18:25.440 --> 18:27.280
 That just doesn't make any sense,

18:27.280 --> 18:29.100
 especially because in order to think

18:29.100 --> 18:32.020
 that you would actually contact another civilization,

18:32.020 --> 18:33.840
 you would have to do it forever,

18:33.840 --> 18:35.840
 you have to keep doing it for millions of years,

18:35.840 --> 18:38.280
 that sounds like a waste of resources.

18:38.280 --> 18:43.120
 If you thought that there were other solar systems

18:43.120 --> 18:44.520
 with planets around them,

18:44.520 --> 18:47.000
 where maybe intelligent life didn't yet exist,

18:47.000 --> 18:48.600
 but might someday,

18:48.600 --> 18:51.380
 you wouldn't try to talk to it with radio waves,

18:51.380 --> 18:53.600
 you would send a spacecraft out there

18:53.600 --> 18:55.560
 and you would park it around there

18:55.560 --> 18:57.360
 and it would be like, from our point of view,

18:57.360 --> 19:00.700
 it'd be like 2001, where there was a monolith.

19:00.700 --> 19:01.540
 Monolith.

19:01.540 --> 19:02.380
 There could be an artifact,

19:02.380 --> 19:04.520
 in fact, the other way works also, right?

19:04.520 --> 19:07.360
 There could be artifacts in our solar system

19:08.440 --> 19:10.480
 that have been put there

19:10.480 --> 19:12.280
 by other technologically advanced civilizations

19:12.280 --> 19:14.640
 and that's how we will eventually contact them.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.840
 We just haven't explored the solar system well enough yet

19:16.840 --> 19:17.680
 to find them.

19:18.580 --> 19:20.000
 The reason why we don't think about that

19:20.000 --> 19:21.520
 is because we're young and impatient, right?

19:21.520 --> 19:24.000
 Like, it would take more than my lifetime

19:24.000 --> 19:26.080
 to actually send something to another star system

19:26.080 --> 19:27.800
 and wait for it and then come back.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.800
 So, but if we start thinking on hundreds of thousands

19:30.800 --> 19:32.720
 of years or million year time scales,

19:32.720 --> 19:34.600
 that's clearly the right thing to do.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.800
 Are you excited by the thing

19:36.800 --> 19:39.360
 that Elon Musk is doing with SpaceX in general?

19:39.360 --> 19:41.620
 Space, but the idea of space exploration,

19:41.620 --> 19:45.360
 even though your, or your species is young and impatient?

19:45.360 --> 19:46.200
 Yeah.

19:46.200 --> 19:49.200
 No, I do think that space travel is crucially important,

19:49.200 --> 19:50.800
 long term.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.500
 Even to other star systems.

19:52.500 --> 19:57.500
 And I think that many people overestimate the difficulty

19:57.500 --> 20:00.940
 because they say, look, if you travel 1% the speed of light

20:00.940 --> 20:02.020
 to another star system,

20:02.020 --> 20:04.060
 we'll be dead before we get there, right?

20:04.060 --> 20:06.180
 And I think that it's much easier.

20:06.180 --> 20:08.120
 And therefore, when they write their science fiction stories,

20:08.120 --> 20:09.580
 they imagine we'd go faster than the speed of light

20:09.580 --> 20:11.700
 because otherwise they're too impatient, right?

20:11.700 --> 20:13.600
 We're not gonna go faster than the speed of light,

20:13.600 --> 20:16.020
 but we could easily imagine that the human lifespan

20:16.020 --> 20:18.100
 gets extended to thousands of years.

20:18.100 --> 20:19.140
 And once you do that,

20:19.140 --> 20:21.180
 then the stars are much closer effectively, right?

20:21.180 --> 20:23.260
 And then what's a hundred year trip, right?

20:23.260 --> 20:25.820
 So I think that that's gonna be the future,

20:25.820 --> 20:28.700
 the far future, not my lifetime once again,

20:28.700 --> 20:30.380
 but baby steps.

20:30.380 --> 20:32.420
 Unless your lifetime gets extended.

20:32.420 --> 20:34.740
 Well, it's in a race against time, right?

20:34.740 --> 20:37.340
 A friend of mine who actually thinks about these things

20:37.340 --> 20:40.460
 said, you know, you and I are gonna die,

20:40.460 --> 20:43.060
 but I don't know about our grandchildren.

20:43.060 --> 20:45.940
 That's, I don't know, predicting the future is hard,

20:45.940 --> 20:47.900
 but that's at least a plausible scenario.

20:47.900 --> 20:51.820
 And so, yeah, no, I think that as we discussed earlier,

20:51.820 --> 20:56.780
 there are threats to the earth, known and unknown, right?

20:56.780 --> 21:01.780
 Having spread humanity and biology elsewhere

21:02.580 --> 21:04.940
 is a really important longterm goal.

21:04.940 --> 21:08.900
 What kind of questions can science not currently answer,

21:08.900 --> 21:09.920
 but might soon?

21:11.480 --> 21:13.860
 When you think about the problems and the mysteries

21:13.860 --> 21:17.840
 before us that may be within reach of science.

21:17.840 --> 21:20.300
 I think an obvious one is the origin of life.

21:20.300 --> 21:22.780
 We don't know how that happened.

21:22.780 --> 21:25.300
 There's a difficulty in knowing how it happened historically

21:25.300 --> 21:27.240
 actually, you know, literally on earth,

21:27.240 --> 21:30.500
 but starting life from non life is something

21:30.500 --> 21:32.420
 I kind of think we're close to, right?

21:32.420 --> 21:33.240
 We're really.

21:33.240 --> 21:34.080
 You really think so?

21:34.080 --> 21:36.740
 Like how difficult is it to start life?

21:36.740 --> 21:39.260
 Well, I've talked to people,

21:39.260 --> 21:41.780
 including on the podcast about this.

21:41.780 --> 21:43.340
 You know, life requires three things.

21:43.340 --> 21:44.220
 Life as we know it.

21:44.220 --> 21:45.500
 So there's a difference with life,

21:45.500 --> 21:47.060
 which who knows what it is,

21:47.060 --> 21:48.140
 and life as we know it,

21:48.140 --> 21:50.780
 which we can talk about with some intelligence.

21:50.780 --> 21:53.840
 So life as we know it requires compartmentalization.

21:53.840 --> 21:56.660
 You need like a little membrane around your cell.

21:56.660 --> 21:58.980
 Metabolism, you need to take in food and eat it

21:58.980 --> 22:01.020
 and let that make you do things.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.620
 And then replication, okay?

22:02.620 --> 22:04.620
 So you need to have some information about who you are

22:04.620 --> 22:07.880
 that you pass down to future generations.

22:07.880 --> 22:11.780
 In the lab, compartmentalization seems pretty easy.

22:11.780 --> 22:13.780
 Not hard to make lipid bilayers

22:13.780 --> 22:16.760
 that come into little cellular walls pretty easily.

22:16.760 --> 22:19.260
 Metabolism and replication are hard,

22:20.160 --> 22:21.900
 but replication we're close to.

22:21.900 --> 22:24.960
 People have made RNA like molecules in the lab

22:24.960 --> 22:28.840
 that I think the state of the art is,

22:28.840 --> 22:30.660
 they're not able to make one molecule

22:30.660 --> 22:32.060
 that reproduces itself,

22:32.060 --> 22:33.600
 but they're able to make two molecules

22:33.600 --> 22:35.260
 that reproduce each other.

22:35.260 --> 22:36.100
 So that's okay.

22:36.100 --> 22:37.100
 That's pretty close.

22:38.060 --> 22:41.060
 Metabolism is harder, believe it or not,

22:41.060 --> 22:42.900
 even though it's sort of the most obvious thing,

22:42.900 --> 22:44.940
 but you want some sort of controlled metabolism

22:44.940 --> 22:47.500
 and the actual cellular machinery in our bodies

22:47.500 --> 22:48.660
 is quite complicated.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.940
 It's hard to see it just popping into existence

22:50.940 --> 22:51.780
 all by itself.

22:51.780 --> 22:52.860
 It probably took a while,

22:53.740 --> 22:56.100
 but we're making progress.

22:56.100 --> 22:57.240
 And in fact, I don't think we're spending

22:57.240 --> 22:58.580
 nearly enough money on it.

22:58.580 --> 23:01.780
 If I were the NSF, I would flood this area with money

23:01.780 --> 23:05.220
 because it would change our view of the world

23:05.220 --> 23:06.780
 if we could actually make life in the lab

23:06.780 --> 23:09.420
 and understand how it was made originally here on earth.

23:09.420 --> 23:11.160
 And I'm sure it'd have some ripple effects

23:11.160 --> 23:12.940
 that help cure disease and so on.

23:12.940 --> 23:14.380
 I mean, just that understanding.

23:14.380 --> 23:16.700
 So synthetic biology is a wonderful big frontier

23:16.700 --> 23:17.980
 where we're making cells.

23:18.940 --> 23:21.100
 Right now, the best way to do that

23:21.100 --> 23:23.620
 is to borrow heavily from existing biology, right?

23:23.620 --> 23:25.380
 Well, Craig Venter several years ago

23:25.380 --> 23:28.220
 created an artificial cell, but all he did was,

23:28.220 --> 23:29.860
 not all he did, it was a tremendous accomplishment,

23:29.860 --> 23:33.180
 but all he did was take out the DNA from a cell

23:33.180 --> 23:37.200
 and put in entirely new DNA and let it boot up and go.

23:37.200 --> 23:42.200
 What about the leap to creating intelligent life on earth?

23:43.420 --> 23:44.260
 Yeah.

23:44.260 --> 23:45.860
 Again, we define intelligence, of course,

23:45.860 --> 23:49.860
 but let's just even say Homo sapiens,

23:49.860 --> 23:54.480
 the modern intelligence in our human brain.

23:55.340 --> 23:58.660
 Do you have a sense of what's involved in that leap

23:58.660 --> 24:00.420
 and how big of a leap that is?

24:00.420 --> 24:03.300
 So AI would count in this, or do you really want life?

24:03.300 --> 24:06.420
 Do you want really an organism in some sense?

24:06.420 --> 24:07.540
 AI would count, I think.

24:07.540 --> 24:08.980
 Okay.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.020
 Yeah, of course, of course AI would count.

24:11.020 --> 24:13.460
 Well, let's say artificial consciousness, right?

24:13.460 --> 24:15.500
 So I do not think we are on the threshold

24:15.500 --> 24:16.760
 of creating artificial consciousness.

24:16.760 --> 24:18.180
 I think it's possible.

24:18.180 --> 24:20.300
 I'm not, again, very educated about how close we are,

24:20.300 --> 24:22.100
 but my impression is not that we're really close

24:22.100 --> 24:24.820
 because we understand how little we understand

24:24.820 --> 24:26.460
 of consciousness and what it is.

24:26.460 --> 24:28.440
 So if we don't have any idea what it is,

24:28.440 --> 24:29.780
 it's hard to imagine we're on the threshold

24:29.780 --> 24:31.620
 of making it ourselves.

24:32.500 --> 24:34.500
 But it's doable, it's possible.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.960
 I don't see any obstacles in principle.

24:35.960 --> 24:38.160
 So yeah, I would hold out some interest

24:38.160 --> 24:40.220
 in that happening eventually.

24:40.220 --> 24:42.700
 I think in general, consciousness,

24:42.700 --> 24:44.420
 I think we would be just surprised

24:44.420 --> 24:49.060
 how easy consciousness is once we create intelligence.

24:49.060 --> 24:50.540
 I think consciousness is a thing

24:50.540 --> 24:54.000
 that's just something we all fake.

24:55.540 --> 24:56.380
 Well, good.

24:56.380 --> 24:57.680
 No, actually, I like this idea that in fact,

24:57.680 --> 25:00.500
 consciousness is way less mysterious than we think

25:00.500 --> 25:02.620
 because we're all at every time, at every moment,

25:02.620 --> 25:04.500
 less conscious than we think we are, right?

25:04.500 --> 25:05.460
 We can fool things.

25:05.460 --> 25:07.780
 And I think that plus the idea

25:07.780 --> 25:11.180
 that you not only have artificial intelligent systems,

25:11.180 --> 25:12.980
 but you put them in a body, right,

25:12.980 --> 25:14.280
 give them a robot body,

25:15.620 --> 25:18.460
 that will help the faking a lot.

25:18.460 --> 25:20.980
 Yeah, I think creating consciousness

25:20.980 --> 25:25.140
 in artificial consciousness is as simple

25:25.140 --> 25:30.020
 as asking a Roomba to say, I'm conscious,

25:30.020 --> 25:32.780
 and refusing to be talked out of it.

25:32.780 --> 25:33.820
 Could be, it could be.

25:33.820 --> 25:36.740
 And I mean, I'm almost being silly,

25:36.740 --> 25:38.280
 but that's what we do.

25:39.660 --> 25:40.940
 That's what we do with each other.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.020
 This is the kind of,

25:42.020 --> 25:44.500
 that consciousness is also a social construct.

25:44.500 --> 25:47.860
 And a lot of our ideas of intelligence is a social construct.

25:47.860 --> 25:52.820
 And so reaching that bar involves something that's beyond,

25:52.820 --> 25:54.940
 that doesn't necessarily involve

25:54.940 --> 25:57.720
 the fundamental understanding of how you go

25:57.720 --> 26:02.500
 from electrons to neurons to cognition.

26:02.500 --> 26:05.060
 No, actually, I think that is an extremely good point.

26:05.060 --> 26:08.660
 And in fact, what it suggests is,

26:08.660 --> 26:10.540
 so yeah, you referred to Kate Darling,

26:10.540 --> 26:11.940
 who I had on the podcast,

26:11.940 --> 26:16.440
 and who does these experiments with very simple robots,

26:16.440 --> 26:18.060
 but they look like animals,

26:18.060 --> 26:20.740
 and they can look like they're experiencing pain,

26:20.740 --> 26:23.380
 and we human beings react very negatively

26:23.380 --> 26:24.400
 to these little robots

26:24.400 --> 26:26.300
 looking like they're experiencing pain.

26:26.300 --> 26:29.980
 And what you wanna say is, yeah, but they're just robots.

26:29.980 --> 26:31.700
 It's not really pain, right?

26:31.700 --> 26:33.080
 It's just some electrons going around.

26:33.080 --> 26:36.300
 But then you realize, you and I are just electrons

26:36.300 --> 26:38.380
 going around, and that's what pain is also.

26:38.380 --> 26:43.060
 And so what I would have an easy time imagining

26:43.060 --> 26:44.740
 is that there is a spectrum

26:44.740 --> 26:47.420
 between these simple little robots that Kate works with

26:47.420 --> 26:49.420
 and a human being,

26:49.420 --> 26:50.940
 where there are things that sort of

26:50.940 --> 26:52.840
 by some strict definition,

26:52.840 --> 26:55.460
 Turing test level thing are not conscious,

26:55.460 --> 26:58.580
 but nevertheless walk and talk like they're conscious.

26:58.580 --> 27:00.220
 And it could be that the future is,

27:00.220 --> 27:02.460
 I mean, Siri is close, right?

27:02.460 --> 27:04.540
 And so it might be the future

27:04.540 --> 27:07.100
 has a lot more agents like that.

27:07.100 --> 27:08.860
 And in fact, rather than someday going,

27:08.860 --> 27:10.700
 aha, we have consciousness,

27:10.700 --> 27:13.180
 we'll just creep up on it with more and more

27:13.180 --> 27:15.220
 accurate reflections of what we expect.

27:15.220 --> 27:18.320
 And in the future, maybe the present,

27:18.320 --> 27:20.800
 for example, we haven't met before,

27:20.800 --> 27:25.300
 and you're basically assuming that I'm human as it's a high

27:25.300 --> 27:28.560
 probability at this time because the yeah,

27:28.560 --> 27:30.200
 but in the future,

27:30.200 --> 27:32.000
 there might be question marks around that, right?

27:32.000 --> 27:33.340
 Yeah, no, absolutely.

27:33.340 --> 27:35.740
 Certainly videos are almost to the point

27:35.740 --> 27:36.740
 where you shouldn't trust them already.

27:36.740 --> 27:39.060
 Photos you can't trust, right?

27:39.060 --> 27:41.700
 Videos is easier to trust,

27:41.700 --> 27:44.020
 but we're getting worse that,

27:44.020 --> 27:46.540
 we're getting better at faking them, right?

27:46.540 --> 27:48.780
 Yeah, so physical embodied people,

27:48.780 --> 27:51.020
 what's so hard about faking that?

27:51.020 --> 27:51.980
 So this is very depressing,

27:51.980 --> 27:53.420
 this conversation we're having right now.

27:53.420 --> 27:54.340
 So I mean,

27:54.340 --> 27:55.180
 To me, it's exciting.

27:55.180 --> 27:56.300
 To me, you're doing it.

27:56.300 --> 27:57.780
 So it's exciting to you,

27:57.780 --> 27:59.060
 but it's a sobering thought.

27:59.060 --> 28:00.420
 We're very bad, right?

28:00.420 --> 28:02.820
 At imagining what the next 50 years are gonna be like

28:02.820 --> 28:04.220
 when we're in the middle of a phase transition

28:04.220 --> 28:05.260
 as we are right now.

28:05.260 --> 28:06.740
 Yeah, and I, in general,

28:06.740 --> 28:09.220
 I'm not blind to all the threats.

28:09.220 --> 28:14.220
 I am excited by the power of technology to solve,

28:14.540 --> 28:18.060
 to protect us against the threats as they evolve.

28:18.060 --> 28:22.340
 I'm not as much as Steven Pinker optimistic about the world,

28:22.340 --> 28:23.740
 but in everything I've seen,

28:23.740 --> 28:27.300
 all of the brilliant people in the world that I've met

28:27.300 --> 28:29.160
 are good people.

28:29.160 --> 28:30.800
 So the army of the good

28:30.800 --> 28:33.400
 in terms of the development of technology is large.

28:33.400 --> 28:36.860
 Okay, you're way more optimistic than I am.

28:37.820 --> 28:39.060
 I think that goodness and badness

28:39.060 --> 28:40.900
 are equally distributed among intelligent

28:40.900 --> 28:42.700
 and unintelligent people.

28:42.700 --> 28:44.660
 I don't see much of a correlation there.

28:44.660 --> 28:46.060
 Interesting.

28:46.060 --> 28:47.300
 Neither of us have proof.

28:47.300 --> 28:48.420
 Yeah, exactly.

28:48.420 --> 28:50.660
 Again, opinions are free, right?

28:50.660 --> 28:52.540
 Nor definitions of good and evil.

28:52.540 --> 28:57.460
 We come without definitions or without data opinions.

28:57.460 --> 29:01.980
 So what kind of questions can science not currently answer

29:01.980 --> 29:04.380
 and may never be able to answer in your view?

29:04.380 --> 29:06.940
 Well, the obvious one is what is good and bad?

29:06.940 --> 29:07.860
 What is right and wrong?

29:07.860 --> 29:09.460
 I think that there are questions that,

29:09.460 --> 29:11.300
 science tells us what happens,

29:11.300 --> 29:13.260
 what the world is and what it does.

29:13.260 --> 29:14.740
 It doesn't say what the world should do

29:14.740 --> 29:15.580
 or what we should do,

29:15.580 --> 29:17.800
 because we're part of the world.

29:17.800 --> 29:19.200
 But we are part of the world

29:19.200 --> 29:21.460
 and we have the ability to feel like something's right,

29:21.460 --> 29:22.740
 something's wrong.

29:22.740 --> 29:25.660
 And to make a very long story very short,

29:25.660 --> 29:28.000
 I think that the idea of moral philosophy

29:28.000 --> 29:30.100
 is systematizing our intuitions

29:30.100 --> 29:31.700
 of what is right and what is wrong.

29:31.700 --> 29:34.580
 And science might be able to predict ahead of time

29:34.580 --> 29:36.180
 what we will do,

29:36.180 --> 29:38.000
 but it won't ever be able to judge

29:38.000 --> 29:39.600
 whether we should have done it or not.

29:39.600 --> 29:43.620
 So, you're kind of unique in terms of scientists.

29:43.620 --> 29:45.520
 Listen, it doesn't have to do with podcasts,

29:45.520 --> 29:47.660
 but even just reaching out,

29:47.660 --> 29:49.080
 I think you referred to as sort of

29:49.080 --> 29:51.300
 doing interdisciplinary science.

29:51.300 --> 29:54.100
 So you reach out and talk to people

29:54.100 --> 29:55.980
 that are outside of your discipline,

29:55.980 --> 30:00.140
 which I always hope that's what science was for.

30:00.140 --> 30:02.300
 In fact, I was a little disillusioned

30:02.300 --> 30:06.420
 when I realized that academia is very siloed.

30:06.420 --> 30:07.260
 Yeah.

30:07.260 --> 30:09.560
 And so the question is,

30:10.700 --> 30:13.020
 how, at your own level,

30:13.020 --> 30:15.380
 how do you prepare for these conversations?

30:15.380 --> 30:16.900
 How do you think about these conversations?

30:16.900 --> 30:18.300
 How do you open your mind enough

30:18.300 --> 30:20.220
 to have these conversations?

30:20.220 --> 30:21.940
 And it may be a little bit broader,

30:21.940 --> 30:24.380
 how can you advise other scientists

30:24.380 --> 30:26.260
 to have these kinds of conversations?

30:26.260 --> 30:28.180
 Not at the podcast,

30:28.180 --> 30:29.860
 the fact that you're doing a podcast is awesome,

30:29.860 --> 30:31.380
 other people get to hear them,

30:31.380 --> 30:34.700
 but it's also good to have it without mics in general.

30:34.700 --> 30:37.460
 It's a good question, but a tough one to answer.

30:37.460 --> 30:40.980
 I think about a guy I know who's a personal trainer,

30:40.980 --> 30:43.240
 and he was asked on a podcast,

30:43.240 --> 30:45.700
 how do we psych ourselves up to do a workout?

30:45.700 --> 30:48.340
 How do we make that discipline to go and work out?

30:48.340 --> 30:50.300
 And he's like, why are you asking me?

30:50.300 --> 30:52.340
 I can't stop working out.

30:52.340 --> 30:54.380
 I don't need to psych myself up.

30:54.380 --> 30:57.340
 So, and likewise, he asked me,

30:57.340 --> 30:59.740
 how do you get to have interdisciplinary conversations

30:59.740 --> 31:00.700
 on all sorts of different things,

31:00.700 --> 31:01.660
 all sorts of different people?

31:01.660 --> 31:04.860
 I'm like, that's what makes me go, right?

31:04.860 --> 31:07.380
 Like that's, I couldn't stop doing that.

31:07.380 --> 31:09.660
 I did that long before any of them were recorded.

31:09.660 --> 31:12.380
 In fact, a lot of the motivation for starting recording it

31:12.380 --> 31:14.420
 was making sure I would read all these books

31:14.420 --> 31:15.460
 that I had purchased, right?

31:15.460 --> 31:17.700
 Like all these books I wanted to read,

31:17.700 --> 31:18.900
 not enough time to read them.

31:18.900 --> 31:20.700
 And now if I have the motivation,

31:20.700 --> 31:23.220
 cause I'm gonna interview Pat Churchland,

31:23.220 --> 31:25.180
 I'm gonna finally read her book.

31:25.180 --> 31:29.460
 You know, and it's absolutely true

31:29.460 --> 31:31.700
 that academia is extraordinarily siloed, right?

31:31.700 --> 31:32.780
 We don't talk to people.

31:32.780 --> 31:34.260
 We rarely do.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.460
 And in fact, when we do, it's punished.

31:36.460 --> 31:38.820
 You know, like the people who do it successfully

31:38.820 --> 31:41.420
 generally first became very successful

31:41.420 --> 31:43.100
 within their little siloed discipline.

31:43.100 --> 31:46.380
 And only then did they start expanding out.

31:46.380 --> 31:47.660
 If you're a young person, you know,

31:47.660 --> 31:48.940
 I have graduate students.

31:48.940 --> 31:52.980
 I try to be very, very candid with them about this,

31:52.980 --> 31:55.580
 that it's, you know, most graduate students

31:55.580 --> 31:57.420
 are to not become faculty members, right?

31:57.420 --> 31:59.020
 It's a tough road.

31:59.020 --> 32:03.140
 And so live the life you wanna live,

32:03.140 --> 32:04.620
 but do it with your eyes open

32:04.620 --> 32:06.900
 about what it does to your job chances.

32:06.900 --> 32:09.580
 And the more broad you are

32:09.580 --> 32:12.900
 and the less time you spend hyper specializing

32:12.900 --> 32:15.780
 in your field, the lower your job chances are.

32:15.780 --> 32:17.060
 That's just an academic reality.

32:17.060 --> 32:20.060
 It's terrible, I don't like it, but it's a reality.

32:20.060 --> 32:22.540
 And for some people, that's fine.

32:22.540 --> 32:24.660
 Like there's plenty of people who are wonderful scientists

32:24.660 --> 32:27.140
 who have zero interest in branching out

32:27.140 --> 32:30.740
 and talking to things, to anyone outside their field.

32:30.740 --> 32:33.740
 But it is disillusioning to me.

32:33.740 --> 32:36.180
 Some of the, you know, romantic notion I had

32:36.180 --> 32:38.220
 of the intellectual academic life

32:38.220 --> 32:39.940
 is belied by the reality of it.

32:39.940 --> 32:43.500
 The idea that we should reach out beyond our discipline

32:43.500 --> 32:48.500
 and that is a positive good is just so rare

32:48.500 --> 32:53.500
 in universities that it may as well not exist at all.

32:53.900 --> 32:57.660
 But that said, even though you're saying you're doing it

32:57.660 --> 33:00.300
 like the personal trainer, because you just can't help it,

33:00.300 --> 33:02.940
 you're also an inspiration to others.

33:02.940 --> 33:04.980
 Like I could speak for myself.

33:05.780 --> 33:09.540
 You know, I also have a career I'm thinking about, right?

33:09.540 --> 33:12.060
 And without your podcast,

33:12.060 --> 33:15.060
 I may have not have been doing this at all, right?

33:15.060 --> 33:19.540
 So it makes me realize that these kinds of conversations

33:19.540 --> 33:23.340
 is kind of what science is about in many ways.

33:23.340 --> 33:26.500
 The reason we write papers, this exchange of ideas,

33:27.460 --> 33:30.540
 is it's much harder to do interdisciplinary papers,

33:30.540 --> 33:31.380
 I would say.

33:31.380 --> 33:35.140
 And conversations are easier.

33:35.140 --> 33:36.820
 So conversations is the beginning.

33:36.820 --> 33:41.180
 And in the field of AI, it's obvious

33:41.180 --> 33:45.580
 that we should think outside of pure computer vision

33:45.580 --> 33:47.540
 competitions on a particular data sets.

33:47.540 --> 33:49.660
 We should think about the broader impact

33:49.660 --> 33:53.740
 of how this can be, you know, reaching out to physics,

33:53.740 --> 33:57.220
 to psychology, to neuroscience and having these

33:57.220 --> 34:00.580
 conversations so that you're an inspiration.

34:00.580 --> 34:05.220
 And so never know how the world changes.

34:05.220 --> 34:08.540
 I mean, the fact that this stuff is out there

34:08.540 --> 34:12.300
 and I've a huge number of people come up to me,

34:12.300 --> 34:16.100
 grad students, really loving the podcast, inspired by it.

34:16.100 --> 34:18.660
 And they will probably have that,

34:18.660 --> 34:20.740
 they'll be ripple effects when they become faculty

34:20.740 --> 34:21.580
 and so on and so on.

34:21.580 --> 34:25.300
 We can end on a balance between pessimism and optimism.

34:25.300 --> 34:27.780
 And Sean, thank you so much for talking to me, it was awesome.

34:27.780 --> 34:29.460
 No, Lex, thank you very much for this conversation.

34:29.460 --> 34:49.460
 It was great.
