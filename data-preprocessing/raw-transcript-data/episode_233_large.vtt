00:00.000 --> 00:02.840
 The following is a conversation with Carl Hart,

00:02.840 --> 00:04.920
 department chair and professor of psychology

00:04.920 --> 00:06.880
 at Columbia University.

00:06.880 --> 00:10.120
 He's the author of several books on the topic of drugs,

00:10.120 --> 00:14.360
 including his most recent, called Drug Use for Grownups,

00:14.360 --> 00:16.520
 that challenges us to, quote,

00:16.520 --> 00:19.400
 use empirical evidence to guide public policy

00:19.400 --> 00:21.800
 even if it makes us uncomfortable.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.400
 His research on drugs, including hard drugs,

00:24.400 --> 00:28.160
 like heroin and cocaine, challenges much of what we think

00:28.160 --> 00:31.480
 we know about drugs and their role in society.

00:31.480 --> 00:34.120
 His main thesis is that drug addiction

00:34.120 --> 00:36.560
 has less to do with the drugs themselves

00:36.560 --> 00:39.800
 and more to do with cooccurring psychiatric disorders,

00:39.800 --> 00:42.280
 such as depression and schizophrenia,

00:42.280 --> 00:46.120
 and socioeconomic factors, such as unemployment,

00:46.120 --> 00:48.320
 underemployment, and resource deprivation

00:48.320 --> 00:49.840
 within the community.

00:49.840 --> 00:53.480
 In addition, he believes that we should legalize all drugs

00:53.480 --> 00:55.320
 so that if people choose to use them,

00:55.320 --> 00:58.160
 they could do so responsibly and openly

00:58.160 --> 01:02.600
 and get help if needed in a controlled, safe environment.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.680
 His ideas are controversial,

01:04.680 --> 01:07.480
 but are fundamentally grounded in empirical data

01:07.480 --> 01:09.480
 and rigorous scientific studies.

01:09.480 --> 01:12.000
 I don't know if his conclusions are right,

01:12.000 --> 01:14.640
 but they are at least worth thinking about.

01:14.640 --> 01:18.920
 So I ask that you consider these ideas with an open mind

01:18.920 --> 01:21.360
 and as always, make sure you exercise

01:21.360 --> 01:24.120
 your critical thinking skills in making decisions

01:24.120 --> 01:26.440
 about substances you put in your body.

01:26.440 --> 01:30.080
 You are a free thinking being,

01:30.080 --> 01:32.040
 the main character, if you will,

01:32.040 --> 01:35.880
 the hero in a story that's being written by you.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.200
 So at the end of the day,

01:37.200 --> 01:40.160
 you are responsible for the choices you make.

01:40.160 --> 01:42.480
 So choose wisely.

01:42.480 --> 01:44.600
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.920
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:46.920 --> 01:48.280
 in the description.

01:48.280 --> 01:52.200
 And now, here's my conversation with Carl Hart.

01:52.200 --> 01:55.760
 I think it is bold and powerful to admit

01:55.760 --> 01:57.400
 to using in your private life

01:57.400 --> 01:59.520
 the drugs that you study in your research,

01:59.520 --> 02:01.200
 including heroin and cocaine.

02:01.200 --> 02:05.680
 So let me ask, what is the experience of taking heroin like?

02:05.680 --> 02:06.640
 What happens to the body?

02:06.640 --> 02:08.920
 What happens to the mind when you take it?

02:08.920 --> 02:11.760
 Well, you know, I take MDMA, cannabis,

02:11.760 --> 02:13.440
 and all the rest of these drugs too.

02:13.440 --> 02:14.880
 I've tried those drugs.

02:15.920 --> 02:18.760
 The experience in the body and the mind,

02:18.760 --> 02:21.600
 I don't really know what people wanna know

02:21.600 --> 02:22.560
 in that regard.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.240
 It's like saying, what is the experience

02:24.240 --> 02:27.760
 of having an orgasm in the body and the mind?

02:27.760 --> 02:31.240
 Or some other sort of event that you really enjoy.

02:32.280 --> 02:34.200
 So I don't really know what people...

02:34.200 --> 02:35.280
 Is that what poetry is for,

02:35.280 --> 02:37.040
 for describing these kinds of experiences?

02:37.040 --> 02:41.240
 I mean, I guess, given MDMA, given psilocybin,

02:41.240 --> 02:42.960
 in the full context of that,

02:42.960 --> 02:45.320
 maybe it's more useful to say,

02:45.320 --> 02:48.960
 what are the differences in experiences

02:48.960 --> 02:50.840
 that your mind goes through?

02:50.840 --> 02:52.840
 Like chemically, biologically.

02:53.760 --> 02:58.760
 So like keeping it strictly to sort of the biology of it

02:59.040 --> 03:01.720
 versus the full environmental human experience.

03:01.720 --> 03:04.720
 Yeah, see, this is a mistake that people make all the time.

03:04.720 --> 03:07.760
 They try to act as if biology

03:07.760 --> 03:10.080
 is the only determinant of drug effects.

03:10.080 --> 03:12.240
 And that's just not how it works.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.600
 You need the environment.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.560
 You need the cage, as they say.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.280
 If you don't have the cage,

03:17.280 --> 03:20.200
 you don't get the full extent of the effects.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.800
 And so like you can take MDMA and have an awful time.

03:23.800 --> 03:27.880
 You can have a time in which you get paranoid and so forth.

03:27.880 --> 03:31.760
 And then you can take that drug under the right conditions

03:31.760 --> 03:34.880
 and it just be like one of the best moments you've ever had.

03:34.880 --> 03:39.480
 It certainly enhanced a number of my relationships.

03:39.480 --> 03:42.040
 But I've also had some times with MDMA

03:42.040 --> 03:43.680
 that haven't been so lovely.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.800
 When the people who you are hanging out with,

03:46.800 --> 03:48.600
 you don't know them, you're distrustful

03:48.600 --> 03:49.960
 and all of those kinds of things.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.800
 So it's important to put context in it.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.840
 Now we can talk about drugs at a biochemical level,

03:55.840 --> 03:57.120
 at a biological level.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.840
 And we kind of do that in this country

03:58.840 --> 04:01.000
 with this fascination with neuroscience.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.040
 And that's an inappropriate kind of fascination

04:06.040 --> 04:07.520
 in the way we talk about it.

04:07.520 --> 04:08.760
 So we can talk about opioids

04:08.760 --> 04:12.360
 and then we can talk about endogenous opioid system

04:12.360 --> 04:13.200
 in the brain.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.760
 We can talk about dopamine

04:14.760 --> 04:17.880
 and other sort of monoamine transmitters

04:17.880 --> 04:20.840
 and what opioids are doing to them.

04:20.840 --> 04:23.160
 And we can do the same thing with MDMA.

04:24.040 --> 04:27.880
 And we won't be any closer to understanding

04:27.880 --> 04:32.880
 the sort of experience that is induced by these drugs.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.320
 Certainly the experience that we all seek.

04:35.320 --> 04:36.400
 You know what I'm saying?

04:36.400 --> 04:38.040
 So getting a positive experience

04:38.040 --> 04:39.360
 or getting a negative experience

04:39.360 --> 04:42.040
 is strongly defined by the environment.

04:42.040 --> 04:44.000
 Strongly dependent upon it.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.920
 But the environment is a very,

04:45.920 --> 04:48.840
 it's a short word that can describe a lot of things.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.880
 So would you say the environment is important

04:51.880 --> 04:55.720
 or the people where you are currently in your life?

04:55.720 --> 04:58.360
 Or is it also dependent on the full trajectory

04:58.360 --> 05:00.640
 of your psychology of your life experiences

05:00.640 --> 05:03.040
 of your parents or the people you came up with

05:03.040 --> 05:04.880
 of the trauma you've experienced

05:04.880 --> 05:07.160
 of the hopes and dreams that were crushed

05:07.160 --> 05:10.880
 or not or the opposite or the success levels

05:10.880 --> 05:11.760
 or all those things.

05:11.760 --> 05:15.600
 Like what are the interesting sort of landscape

05:15.600 --> 05:19.480
 of experiences that contribute to how you actually feel

05:19.480 --> 05:20.440
 when you take a drug?

05:20.440 --> 05:21.400
 Right on.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.160
 So all of those things are important.

05:23.160 --> 05:26.200
 But you know, like if someone had trauma in childhood

05:26.200 --> 05:28.200
 and they did the work and they dealt with it

05:28.200 --> 05:30.520
 that's not so important in this case.

05:30.520 --> 05:31.760
 But if they didn't deal with it

05:31.760 --> 05:34.880
 and that trauma is being triggered in that event

05:34.880 --> 05:38.120
 in that moment, then it's important.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.840
 But let's just take somebody like me.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.000
 I'm 54 years old.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.640
 I'll be 55 this month actually.

05:43.640 --> 05:47.040
 And you know, I've done a lot of work

05:47.040 --> 05:50.080
 in terms of figuring out who I am

05:50.080 --> 05:52.600
 and I'm comfortable with myself.

05:52.600 --> 05:57.600
 And I know how to set limits for whatever it is I'm doing.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.040
 And so I know I need to work out.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.480
 I know I need to eat well.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.240
 I know I need to sleep well.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.840
 I know I need to be in an environment

06:07.840 --> 06:10.880
 with people within my trust.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.160
 And then if all of those things are met,

06:13.160 --> 06:16.560
 oh, it's likely to be a good time.

06:16.560 --> 06:17.400
 You know what I'm saying?

06:17.400 --> 06:20.000
 But if I haven't slept, if I haven't worked out,

06:20.000 --> 06:23.400
 if I don't feel good, it won't be a good time.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.840
 But I try and be responsible

06:25.840 --> 06:30.840
 and take care of my eating habits, sleeping habits,

06:30.920 --> 06:34.080
 make sure my responsibilities are taken care of.

06:34.080 --> 06:39.080
 And so when I'm in that moment, I just enjoy that moment.

06:39.080 --> 06:39.920
 I'm there.

06:39.920 --> 06:42.880
 I'm not thinking about a bill that I didn't pay.

06:42.880 --> 06:46.760
 I'm not thinking about, oh, I forgot to do this for my kid.

06:46.760 --> 06:47.840
 I'm not thinking about that

06:47.840 --> 06:49.760
 because all of those things are taken care of.

06:49.760 --> 06:53.080
 If they're not taken care of, it will impact the experience

06:53.080 --> 06:55.520
 and it may negatively impact the experience.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.480
 Well, that is the counterintuitive,

06:59.480 --> 07:03.040
 even controversial finding from your recent book.

07:03.040 --> 07:06.840
 So we should kind of, I know it seems obvious to you,

07:06.840 --> 07:08.640
 but I think a lot of people hearing this

07:08.640 --> 07:11.120
 would think it's quite non obvious.

07:11.120 --> 07:15.360
 So in your new book, Drug Use for Grownups,

07:15.360 --> 07:18.000
 you write for the finding section.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.480
 I discovered that the predominant effects produced

07:20.480 --> 07:24.160
 by the drugs discussed in this book are positive.

07:24.160 --> 07:27.320
 It didn't matter whether the drug in question was cannabis,

07:27.320 --> 07:31.360
 cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, or psilocybin.

07:31.360 --> 07:35.280
 Overwhelmingly, consumers expressed feeling more altruistic,

07:35.280 --> 07:39.320
 empathetic, euphoric, focused, grateful, and tranquil.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.840
 They also experienced enhanced social interactions,

07:41.840 --> 07:43.640
 a great sense of purpose and meaning,

07:43.640 --> 07:46.320
 and increased sexual intimacy and performance.

07:46.320 --> 07:49.480
 This constellation of findings

07:49.480 --> 07:52.960
 challenged my original beliefs about drugs and their effects.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.560
 I had been indoctrinated to be biased

07:55.560 --> 07:57.520
 toward the negative effects of drug use.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.040
 But over the past two plus decades,

08:00.040 --> 08:03.000
 I had gained a deeper, more nuanced understanding.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
 These words are very counterintuitive to a lot of people.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.800
 I think like you also mentioned in the book and elsewhere,

08:12.800 --> 08:15.560
 people have come around to maybe psilocybin

08:16.720 --> 08:20.680
 being one such drug, maybe cannabis being one such drug,

08:20.680 --> 08:22.440
 but you also mentioned other drugs

08:22.440 --> 08:24.720
 like cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine.

08:26.520 --> 08:28.760
 Can you just linger on this point?

08:28.760 --> 08:33.040
 How do we get the positive effects of those drugs

08:33.040 --> 08:34.520
 and why in the media,

08:34.520 --> 08:36.840
 and the general conception we have of these drugs

08:36.840 --> 08:41.480
 is that they were going to make a bad life worse

08:41.480 --> 08:43.360
 or ruin a good life?

08:43.360 --> 08:44.920
 Well, so your first question was,

08:44.920 --> 08:47.560
 how do we harness the positive effects?

08:47.560 --> 08:49.880
 How do we increase the likelihood

08:49.880 --> 08:51.120
 of getting the positive effects?

08:51.120 --> 08:53.000
 Again, like I said,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.640
 we wanna make sure that people are responsible

08:55.640 --> 08:57.760
 and they've handled their responsibilities,

08:57.760 --> 09:00.240
 make sure they eat well, sleep well, exercise,

09:00.240 --> 09:03.240
 all of those sorts of things play an important role.

09:03.240 --> 09:06.280
 And also if they know exactly what they're getting

09:06.280 --> 09:08.320
 and then they're not paranoid about,

09:08.320 --> 09:13.320
 it's something contaminated in some adulterant in my drug.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.080
 So you wanna make sure you know exactly what you have.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.800
 Once you satisfy those kinds of things,

09:18.800 --> 09:20.960
 you understand the dose and potency,

09:20.960 --> 09:22.480
 you understand all of those things

09:22.480 --> 09:25.560
 to decrease any sort of anxiety you might have

09:25.560 --> 09:29.040
 about the substance itself, it increases the likelihood

09:29.040 --> 09:30.600
 that you will have a better time.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.160
 So anxiety is a big one, you need to remove the anxiety.

09:33.160 --> 09:36.640
 Anxiety is critical, it's huge.

09:36.640 --> 09:39.400
 Many of the negative effects that we see with drugs

09:39.400 --> 09:41.280
 have to do with anxiety

09:41.280 --> 09:44.600
 and not necessarily anxiety because a drug induced it,

09:44.600 --> 09:49.160
 it's the anxiety that the situation induced a lot of times.

09:49.160 --> 09:50.200
 And then you ask like,

09:50.200 --> 09:53.360
 well, why does this sound counterintuitive?

09:53.360 --> 09:58.360
 Why does the media report differently?

09:59.040 --> 10:01.160
 Well, because there's money in reporting

10:01.160 --> 10:04.280
 the negative effects almost exclusively.

10:04.280 --> 10:08.280
 Think about writing a newspaper article.

10:08.280 --> 10:11.640
 It's really easy to get the population all ginned up

10:11.640 --> 10:14.960
 about something like an opioid crisis, overdoses,

10:14.960 --> 10:17.640
 and you don't even have to tell people

10:17.640 --> 10:20.960
 how to keep people safe if you're talking about overdose.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.720
 You don't even have to say why people are dying

10:23.720 --> 10:24.720
 from overdoses.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.600
 Like overdoses in our country happen largely

10:27.600 --> 10:30.200
 because people get contaminated drugs,

10:30.200 --> 10:33.360
 because people are combining sedatives

10:33.360 --> 10:36.080
 and they don't know that this enhances

10:36.080 --> 10:38.640
 the respiratory depressing effects of drugs.

10:38.640 --> 10:39.560
 They don't know.

10:39.560 --> 10:41.960
 But when you read these newspaper articles,

10:41.960 --> 10:43.240
 they don't say this.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.600
 They don't say how to keep people safe.

10:45.600 --> 10:48.640
 All they do is frighten the population.

10:48.640 --> 10:49.480
 There's money in that.

10:49.480 --> 10:53.000
 And then we think about people who write TV shows,

10:54.120 --> 10:56.440
 the people who write movies.

10:56.440 --> 11:01.120
 Most of the stuff written about drugs is just bullshit.

11:01.120 --> 11:04.000
 I think about, I love going to watch comedians

11:04.000 --> 11:06.200
 and the comedians when they talk about drugs,

11:06.200 --> 11:09.520
 again, most of the things that they say about drugs

11:09.520 --> 11:10.560
 is bullshit.

11:10.560 --> 11:13.640
 I mean, you can say the stupidest things about drugs

11:13.640 --> 11:14.720
 and be believed.

11:14.720 --> 11:19.000
 You can write a movie and you don't even have

11:19.000 --> 11:20.720
 to develop your characters.

11:20.720 --> 11:23.200
 If you throw drugs into the mix, you say,

11:23.200 --> 11:24.520
 oh, he's a drug dealer.

11:24.520 --> 11:25.960
 You don't have to say anything

11:25.960 --> 11:27.200
 about that person's background

11:27.200 --> 11:31.280
 or about that person being developed as a character

11:31.280 --> 11:33.520
 because the population think they know.

11:33.520 --> 11:37.000
 And the writer is lazy

11:37.000 --> 11:39.520
 and does not do any sort of development.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.720
 Just think about any more.

11:42.720 --> 11:45.760
 Oh, let's think about the Sopranos, for example.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.240
 They have a new program coming out.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.360
 So let's think about them for a second.

11:50.360 --> 11:54.840
 The Sopranos is a show in which the lead character,

11:54.840 --> 11:57.360
 Tony, kills people for a living.

11:57.360 --> 11:58.760
 That's what he does, right?

11:59.920 --> 12:04.920
 This character actually made a sympathetic for him

12:05.480 --> 12:10.480
 when he is besmirching and denigrating his nephew,

12:10.840 --> 12:13.200
 Christopher, for using a drug.

12:13.200 --> 12:17.760
 And we feel sympathy for Tony, the character,

12:17.760 --> 12:22.520
 who just killed somebody, who is a horrible person,

12:22.520 --> 12:26.760
 but being a drug user is a worse person.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.760
 That's what the show wants us to believe.

12:28.760 --> 12:32.840
 Tony's a racist, murderer, all of these things,

12:32.840 --> 12:34.320
 but we feel sympathy for him.

12:34.320 --> 12:38.120
 But we don't feel sympathy for anyone who uses drugs.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.600
 That's some crazy shit.

12:39.600 --> 12:42.400
 I mean, and the American public buys into it.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.640
 That is, that's wild to me,

12:44.640 --> 12:47.040
 and that we all bought into this crap.

12:47.040 --> 12:50.520
 And that's what we do in damn near everything

12:50.520 --> 12:52.840
 that's in film, on television.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.960
 And it's like, what's wrong with you people?

12:55.960 --> 12:59.680
 So why aren't there not more stories

12:59.680 --> 13:03.080
 of grownups using drugs?

13:03.080 --> 13:05.400
 The full spectrum of drugs that we're talking about.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.520
 Why isn't there?

13:06.520 --> 13:09.040
 So we talked offline about Joe Rogan.

13:09.040 --> 13:12.480
 He's somebody who started smoking weed later in life,

13:12.480 --> 13:13.560
 which is an interesting story.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.040
 Like when he's already very successful

13:16.040 --> 13:17.320
 and he has a very interesting way

13:17.320 --> 13:19.160
 of describing his experience with weed,

13:19.160 --> 13:22.280
 that it was like enhancing just productivity.

13:22.280 --> 13:23.400
 It actually, I think he says,

13:23.400 --> 13:25.200
 like it increases anxiety a little bit

13:25.200 --> 13:29.480
 in a way that was productive, like paranoia, not anxiety.

13:29.480 --> 13:32.320
 And so that's an interesting story of an adult

13:32.320 --> 13:36.880
 talking about the use of weed for productivity purposes.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.080
 But you don't get those stories very often.

13:39.080 --> 13:39.920
 Why?

13:40.960 --> 13:41.960
 I think fear.

13:41.960 --> 13:46.600
 People are afraid that they will be belittled, dismissed,

13:46.600 --> 13:48.360
 all of these things, that's a drug addict

13:48.360 --> 13:51.240
 or some negative thing, but cannabis is lightweight.

13:51.240 --> 13:54.560
 Come on, you can admit cannabis these days.

13:54.560 --> 13:58.360
 And the fact that I don't know when Joe started,

13:58.360 --> 14:01.440
 but if he did start later in life, that's cool.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.920
 I mean, you are mature, developed,

14:04.920 --> 14:08.800
 you have developed some responsibility skills,

14:08.800 --> 14:09.960
 all of these kinds of things.

14:09.960 --> 14:12.080
 This is a good thing.

14:12.080 --> 14:17.080
 You don't want people to engage in any kind of behaviors

14:17.160 --> 14:19.200
 when they're young and immature

14:19.200 --> 14:21.720
 that might put them in harm's way.

14:21.720 --> 14:26.640
 And so we want people to be developed at least.

14:26.640 --> 14:31.640
 I mean, whether it's being in a relationship with a partner

14:32.800 --> 14:35.520
 or whether it's driving an automobile,

14:35.520 --> 14:38.160
 all of these things that can be potentially harmful,

14:38.160 --> 14:40.800
 but extremely beneficial

14:40.800 --> 14:43.120
 if you are responsible enough to handle them.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.720
 You want people to be mature, so that's a good thing.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.920
 So how are you supposed to, like somebody like me,

14:49.920 --> 14:52.760
 somebody like Joe, how are you supposed to understand

14:52.760 --> 14:55.240
 what the dangers are, what the negative effects are?

14:55.240 --> 14:58.240
 So you said automobile, relationships.

14:59.240 --> 15:03.520
 I think I have a reasonably, it's crappy,

15:03.520 --> 15:06.400
 but reasonable understanding of all the troubles

15:06.400 --> 15:09.800
 I can get with in relationships and what things to avoid.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.640
 Same thing with driving a car.

15:11.640 --> 15:12.880
 I have no idea.

15:12.880 --> 15:16.960
 I'm in the dark in terms of what are the things

15:16.960 --> 15:21.600
 to be careful about, what to avoid with drug use

15:21.600 --> 15:24.080
 when we're talking about the heavy drugs.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.880
 Have you ever drank alcohol?

15:25.880 --> 15:26.720
 Yes.

15:26.720 --> 15:27.560
 That's drug use.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.840
 I know, I drank a lot.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.880
 But I understand that because culturally I came up,

15:31.880 --> 15:35.880
 I was taught a lot of like, this is what you don't do

15:35.880 --> 15:37.320
 and this is what you do.

15:37.320 --> 15:38.640
 This is when you drink a lot.

15:38.640 --> 15:40.760
 I mean, you see the effects, you see the,

15:40.760 --> 15:42.280
 there's a lot of negative examples,

15:42.280 --> 15:45.080
 there's positive examples of social stimulant.

15:45.080 --> 15:49.240
 There's examples of great artists using alcohol

15:49.240 --> 15:52.960
 to sort of, I don't know, to help be the catalyst

15:52.960 --> 15:55.840
 for that magic moment, for all of that.

15:55.840 --> 15:59.480
 I have some examples now, especially in America,

15:59.480 --> 16:02.320
 the same with weed, more and more you're starting

16:02.320 --> 16:07.200
 to get a lot of stories of psychedelics of different kinds.

16:07.200 --> 16:12.200
 There's psilocybin where you have mushrooms

16:12.280 --> 16:15.400
 or even MDMA used sort of positively.

16:15.400 --> 16:19.680
 There's kind of like negative stories from the past

16:19.680 --> 16:22.720
 about acid, about LSD being used,

16:22.720 --> 16:26.760
 ultimately for productive ends,

16:26.760 --> 16:28.040
 but it destroyed the person.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.480
 That's kind of how the story goes.

16:29.480 --> 16:30.880
 It was like a trade off.

16:30.880 --> 16:33.560
 You take, it's like, what is it?

16:33.560 --> 16:36.760
 Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil to learn guitar.

16:36.760 --> 16:37.800
 Like it's a trade off.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.160
 You can take the drug, you're gonna create some good stuff,

16:40.160 --> 16:41.440
 but you have to pay for it.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.440
 Those are the stories.

16:42.440 --> 16:45.120
 That's some bullshit we tell children, come on.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.320
 That's exactly right.

16:46.320 --> 16:47.360
 You're exactly right.

16:47.360 --> 16:49.760
 These fairy tales, these cautionary tales

16:49.760 --> 16:52.840
 that we tell people, we have to grow up.

16:52.840 --> 16:56.360
 That's what the book is about, drug use for grownups.

16:56.360 --> 17:01.360
 We tell people, Pinocchio, if you lie, your nose grow.

17:02.320 --> 17:03.160
 Who believes that?

17:03.160 --> 17:04.760
 Who believes that there are fairy tales?

17:04.760 --> 17:06.800
 But that's exactly what these stories are.

17:06.800 --> 17:11.040
 They're in the same vein as those kind of stories,

17:11.040 --> 17:11.880
 as Pinocchio.

17:13.520 --> 17:16.240
 Like you said, when you were learning about alcohol,

17:16.240 --> 17:20.240
 you were told what to do, what not to do, so forth.

17:20.240 --> 17:24.680
 The same can be true with MDMA, with cocaine, with heroin.

17:24.680 --> 17:28.360
 The same is true, because there are some times

17:28.360 --> 17:32.200
 when there are some potential dangers that you should avoid.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.920
 And I wrote about some of them,

17:36.040 --> 17:39.320
 certainly in my work, just throughout all of my writings.

17:39.320 --> 17:40.800
 I talk about those kinds of things

17:40.800 --> 17:43.040
 and other people talk about these things.

17:43.040 --> 17:47.920
 The problem is, is that we're getting our education

17:47.920 --> 17:51.920
 from bullshit sources, from people who believe

17:51.920 --> 17:54.840
 in this kind of Pinocchio thing.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.120
 And it just does not fit with the evidence.

17:58.120 --> 18:01.960
 And the evidence we all publish in the scientific literature,

18:01.960 --> 18:04.160
 all these things that I'm saying,

18:04.160 --> 18:05.840
 it's there in the literature.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.840
 I mean, at a place like Columbia,

18:07.840 --> 18:12.840
 we give these drugs thousands of doses every year.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.840
 Do you think we would be doing this?

18:15.840 --> 18:18.200
 And we do this with research grants

18:18.200 --> 18:22.400
 that's funded by the public, taxpayers dollars.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.240
 Do you think we would be allowed to do this

18:25.240 --> 18:28.040
 if these drugs were so dangerous?

18:29.040 --> 18:30.920
 It's just nonsense.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.360
 I mean, and the drugs we're talking about,

18:33.360 --> 18:37.320
 they are all approved for medical use

18:37.320 --> 18:38.960
 somewhere in the world.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.680
 And the studies you conduct are basically

18:42.680 --> 18:44.520
 asking what kinds of questions.

18:44.520 --> 18:49.160
 So you take the full range of drugs you're talking about

18:49.160 --> 18:53.680
 from marijuana to psilocybin to MDMA to cocaine and heroin.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.000
 What is the study looking at?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.920
 Like what the actual experience with the positive

18:56.920 --> 18:59.560
 and negative effects of the experience on the drug are

18:59.560 --> 19:01.200
 in the control conditions.

19:01.200 --> 19:05.280
 Yeah, so we did these kinds of experiments with alcohol,

19:05.280 --> 19:08.520
 nicotine, all these drugs in order to have

19:08.520 --> 19:12.120
 an empirical database to tell people

19:12.120 --> 19:15.040
 exactly what these drugs do and what they don't do.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.640
 The conditions under which the drugs

19:17.640 --> 19:19.240
 will produce positive effects,

19:19.240 --> 19:21.880
 the conditions under which the drugs were more likely

19:21.880 --> 19:23.680
 to produce negative effects.

19:23.680 --> 19:28.040
 All of this information is important for society to know.

19:28.040 --> 19:31.920
 And we do know, and that's why we're collecting the data.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.920
 We're collecting the data to help us with treatment

19:35.920 --> 19:38.720
 if someone is having problems with these data.

19:38.720 --> 19:43.720
 Hopefully we'll understand more about how to help them

19:45.720 --> 19:48.640
 deal with their problems based on some of the research

19:48.640 --> 19:49.480
 that we're doing.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.960
 So what kind of negative effects are we looking out for?

19:51.960 --> 19:53.880
 Like what are the properties of drugs

19:53.880 --> 19:55.000
 we should be careful about?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.680
 Is it addictive properties?

19:56.680 --> 20:01.000
 How addictive it is, how destructive or painful,

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
 whatever the withdrawal processes,

20:06.000 --> 20:07.960
 what kind of things are we looking out for?

20:07.960 --> 20:09.760
 Yeah, those are certain kind of questions

20:09.760 --> 20:12.760
 we certainly have asked because like something like

20:12.760 --> 20:16.720
 crack cocaine versus alcohol or heroin

20:16.720 --> 20:20.560
 when it comes to withdrawal of physical dependence.

20:20.560 --> 20:24.920
 Like cocaine has a very limited sort of withdrawal symptoms.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.720
 I mean, it's hard to see.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.040
 Same is true with methamphetamine.

20:28.040 --> 20:32.040
 But with heroin, you certainly can see a withdrawal syndrome

20:32.040 --> 20:36.960
 that's unpleasant, but with alcohol that withdrawal

20:36.960 --> 20:39.040
 can actually kill you.

20:39.040 --> 20:42.400
 So heroin is unpleasant and not lovely,

20:42.400 --> 20:44.560
 but with alcohol withdrawal, that's the one,

20:44.560 --> 20:45.760
 that's the most dangerous.

20:45.760 --> 20:47.560
 I mean, all of these kind of questions

20:47.560 --> 20:50.800
 we wanna know answers to.

20:50.800 --> 20:55.440
 And so when we think about heroin or some other drugs

20:55.440 --> 20:57.880
 and you say like, what kind of negative effects?

20:57.880 --> 21:00.920
 Negative effects, we don't talk about much in the society.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.800
 The main thing that really concerns me

21:02.800 --> 21:06.240
 about like heroin use really is constipation.

21:06.240 --> 21:11.200
 So if people are using heroin on a regular basis

21:11.200 --> 21:16.200
 and then they have a sort of slowing of their gut modality,

21:16.480 --> 21:20.640
 they're likely to increase constipation and that's not good.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.920
 I mean, for your general health,

21:22.920 --> 21:25.640
 but we never talk about that in this society.

21:25.640 --> 21:28.800
 And that's probably the most important thing

21:28.800 --> 21:32.680
 aside from the fact that people get contaminated street drugs

21:32.680 --> 21:34.800
 and that sort of stuff and increase the likelihood

21:34.800 --> 21:37.480
 of maybe dying from some contaminant

21:37.480 --> 21:40.200
 or people who are inexperienced

21:40.200 --> 21:42.600
 and they're mixing heroin with other sedatives.

21:42.600 --> 21:46.840
 That's not good, but the constipation is a huge one.

21:47.800 --> 21:51.000
 And then other sort of drugs, negative effects

21:51.960 --> 21:54.920
 like the amphetamines, all of the amphetamines,

21:54.920 --> 21:56.840
 they disrupt sleep, food intake,

21:56.840 --> 21:59.480
 all of these things are so critical

21:59.480 --> 22:02.960
 for sustaining human life, but we never talk about that

22:02.960 --> 22:05.880
 because it's not as sexy as this nonsense

22:05.880 --> 22:08.120
 that people write about like addiction.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.080
 Addiction has almost nothing to do

22:10.080 --> 22:11.480
 with the drugs themselves.

22:11.480 --> 22:16.720
 And I make that comment because the vast majority of users

22:16.720 --> 22:19.600
 for any drug never become addicted.

22:19.600 --> 22:23.040
 And so if the vast majority of users don't become addicted,

22:23.040 --> 22:25.200
 then you have to move beyond the drug

22:25.200 --> 22:27.560
 when you're talking about the phenomenon interest

22:27.560 --> 22:29.320
 in this case, addiction.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.560
 And so when we think about addiction,

22:31.560 --> 22:35.080
 it has much more to do with our psychosocial environment

22:35.080 --> 22:38.520
 than the drug itself, but that's not sexy.

22:38.520 --> 22:41.280
 So addiction is even the property of the environment,

22:41.280 --> 22:44.320
 not a property, a result of the environment.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.320
 It certainly can be.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.760
 There are people who are suffering

22:47.760 --> 22:52.760
 from cooccurring mental illness like depression, anxiety.

22:52.800 --> 22:55.440
 I mean, that's within the person, of course,

22:55.440 --> 22:57.920
 and that increases the likelihood for addiction.

22:57.920 --> 23:01.440
 So that's not so much the environment,

23:01.440 --> 23:03.640
 but there are people who, for example,

23:03.640 --> 23:07.800
 they have chronic unrealistic expectations heaped on them.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.800
 And those people are more likely

23:09.800 --> 23:12.000
 to have some problems with drugs.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.360
 There are people who are just immature,

23:14.360 --> 23:18.280
 not having developed responsibility skills.

23:18.280 --> 23:20.640
 They are likely to have some problems

23:20.640 --> 23:23.640
 if they engage in some of these behaviors.

23:23.640 --> 23:27.120
 There are people who lost their jobs, COVID,

23:27.120 --> 23:30.080
 factories went away, a wide range of things.

23:30.080 --> 23:33.560
 And those people used to have standing in their community.

23:33.560 --> 23:35.520
 Now they have none.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.680
 Those people might be susceptible

23:37.680 --> 23:41.240
 to having a drug related problem if they indulge.

23:41.240 --> 23:44.400
 All of these kinds of issues are far more important

23:44.400 --> 23:45.560
 than the drug itself.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.560
 And so they could seek escape in a particular drug.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.320
 I mean, there is a biochemical thing

23:51.320 --> 23:52.400
 to each of these drugs,

23:52.400 --> 23:55.280
 and some pull you in harder than others

23:55.280 --> 23:56.960
 when you need the escape, right?

23:56.960 --> 23:58.880
 When you're not doing well in life.

23:58.880 --> 24:00.200
 What evidence you have for that bullshit?

24:00.200 --> 24:01.040
 I don't.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.000
 Yeah, because there is none.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.760
 There is absolutely none.

24:03.760 --> 24:06.800
 I mean, people say stuff like that,

24:06.800 --> 24:09.520
 and that's the problem.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.480
 That's precisely the problem.

24:11.480 --> 24:14.840
 See, I'm operating from limited personal evidence.

24:14.840 --> 24:16.160
 Well, this is a problem though,

24:16.160 --> 24:18.680
 but we have a scientific database.

24:18.680 --> 24:21.240
 We don't need personal evidence for this.

24:21.240 --> 24:24.600
 We have, in my book, I try to go through some of the science

24:24.600 --> 24:26.480
 so people could understand.

24:26.480 --> 24:29.840
 It's like when you have a math problem,

24:29.840 --> 24:31.000
 you don't want people saying,

24:31.000 --> 24:32.760
 well, you know, I feel like this.

24:32.760 --> 24:33.960
 Fuck what you feel.

24:33.960 --> 24:35.960
 What does the data say?

24:35.960 --> 24:38.480
 So one of the problems with the data,

24:38.480 --> 24:41.800
 so one data is there's the studies that you're doing,

24:41.800 --> 24:43.240
 this is excellent research work,

24:43.240 --> 24:45.560
 but there's some of the drugs that are illegal.

24:45.560 --> 24:46.960
 Yes. And some are legal.

24:47.960 --> 24:49.200
 So you have just,

24:50.400 --> 24:53.160
 it's unfortunate that some of the drugs are illegal

24:53.160 --> 24:54.920
 or whatever you believe,

24:54.920 --> 24:57.600
 but there's not enough of a data set of public

24:57.600 --> 24:58.800
 and the open use.

24:58.800 --> 25:01.440
 That's like you got in the wild data set.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.920
 It'd be nice to do, you know, thousands of people

25:03.920 --> 25:06.080
 and see from all the different kinds of environments

25:06.080 --> 25:08.520
 and all that kind of stuff to get an understanding.

25:08.520 --> 25:13.240
 I think we have a substantial database,

25:13.240 --> 25:15.320
 but people just ignore it.

25:15.320 --> 25:16.160
 Got it.

25:17.120 --> 25:21.440
 That said, let me ask you the question of legalization.

25:21.440 --> 25:26.200
 So should, in your view, all drugs be legalized?

25:26.200 --> 25:27.920
 The drugs that people seek

25:27.920 --> 25:30.480
 certainly should be legally regulated

25:30.480 --> 25:32.400
 and available to adults.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.960
 So when I say the drugs people seek,

25:33.960 --> 25:38.080
 like cannabis, MDMA, cocaine, heroin,

25:39.840 --> 25:42.280
 those drugs certainly should be available.

25:42.280 --> 25:45.480
 And some of the psychedelics that people seek.

25:45.480 --> 25:50.480
 Now, the thing about it is that some people think that,

25:50.480 --> 25:52.080
 oh, it will be a free fall.

25:52.080 --> 25:54.000
 These drugs are available to everyone.

25:54.000 --> 25:54.880
 That's not true.

25:54.880 --> 25:57.640
 I mean, there will be age requirements

25:57.640 --> 25:59.320
 and maybe other requirements,

25:59.320 --> 26:01.120
 but they should be available.

26:01.120 --> 26:04.480
 And we should also do like what we do with alcohol.

26:04.480 --> 26:08.200
 We can put enough alcohol in a bottle to kill you,

26:08.200 --> 26:09.320
 but we don't.

26:09.320 --> 26:13.840
 So we regulate it such that the amount that's in the bottle

26:13.840 --> 26:18.240
 enhances the safety and minimizes the potential harms.

26:18.240 --> 26:20.560
 We can do the same thing with these other drugs.

26:20.560 --> 26:22.880
 And we can also say, okay,

26:22.880 --> 26:25.960
 we won't be selling intravenous preparations

26:25.960 --> 26:27.720
 of any of these drugs.

26:28.760 --> 26:32.640
 The drugs that the routes of administration will be oral

26:32.640 --> 26:36.640
 and I don't know, let's say intranasal.

26:38.160 --> 26:40.720
 Again, routes of administration,

26:40.720 --> 26:43.640
 the dose that you have in each unit,

26:43.640 --> 26:48.640
 all can minimize harm based on how you do these things.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.040
 And we can do that.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.200
 We have the technology, we have the knowhow.

26:53.760 --> 26:55.040
 So you're actually making me think

26:55.040 --> 26:56.120
 about alcohol a little bit.

26:56.120 --> 26:58.760
 So if I were, say the drugs become legalized

26:58.760 --> 27:00.160
 in the way you're describing,

27:00.160 --> 27:04.440
 and me, Lex, wanted to, as an adult,

27:04.440 --> 27:06.360
 explore some of these drugs,

27:06.360 --> 27:10.120
 what are some procedures do you think

27:10.120 --> 27:14.920
 for sort of safe, positive exploration of those drugs?

27:14.920 --> 27:16.840
 The reason I say I'm thinking about alcohol

27:16.840 --> 27:18.280
 because I don't think,

27:18.280 --> 27:22.440
 besides not putting enough alcohol in a bottle to kill you,

27:22.440 --> 27:25.800
 I don't think anyone ever gave me specific instructions.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.280
 I think it's kind of word of mouth

27:27.280 --> 27:30.880
 and examples of people doing the wrong thing.

27:30.880 --> 27:33.960
 You kind of get it through osmosis that way.

27:33.960 --> 27:36.280
 Is that basically what we would do,

27:36.280 --> 27:38.200
 this kind of free exploration of use?

27:38.200 --> 27:41.280
 No, we have to change our education about these things.

27:41.280 --> 27:44.200
 I mean, let's just take a drug like cocaine.

27:44.200 --> 27:45.520
 Cocaine's a stimulant.

27:46.600 --> 27:47.960
 You want to make sure people understand

27:47.960 --> 27:50.400
 that they shouldn't be taking cocaine near bedtime.

27:50.400 --> 27:54.960
 You know, they need to get a certain amount of hours of sleep

27:54.960 --> 27:57.400
 and they need to get up in the morning.

27:57.400 --> 28:00.000
 Cocaine probably isn't a drug for you at night.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.680
 Certainly not.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.600
 Certainly not amphetamines at night for most people.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.840
 And also, if you want to make sure that you,

28:06.840 --> 28:09.520
 they need to understand that cocaine

28:09.520 --> 28:11.800
 can also disrupt your food intake.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.280
 Not as much as the amphetamines,

28:13.280 --> 28:15.800
 but all of these kinds of things people need to know

28:15.800 --> 28:18.440
 so they can have proper nutrition

28:18.440 --> 28:22.480
 and they can time their drug use

28:22.480 --> 28:25.520
 around these other important functions

28:25.520 --> 28:26.880
 that's the same human life.

28:26.880 --> 28:30.920
 So we have to make sure that we educate people.

28:30.920 --> 28:34.400
 We can't just throw people in a while.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.120
 That's stupid.

28:36.120 --> 28:37.920
 I gotta tell you, I mean, for me,

28:37.920 --> 28:40.400
 and even given your book and for people listening to this,

28:40.400 --> 28:44.160
 it's still tough to hear that the thing

28:44.160 --> 28:46.720
 we should be concerned about with cocaine

28:48.520 --> 28:50.560
 is the same as with caffeine.

28:50.560 --> 28:52.000
 Don't take it before bed.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.520
 And the thing we should be concerned with heroin

28:54.520 --> 28:55.440
 is constipation.

28:55.440 --> 28:56.280
 Yeah.

28:58.880 --> 29:00.480
 Okay.

29:00.480 --> 29:04.840
 But the questions I keep wanting to ask you,

29:04.840 --> 29:07.840
 I should be asking the same things of alcohol,

29:07.840 --> 29:10.760
 but when you're not doing well psychologically

29:10.760 --> 29:11.840
 in the ways you describe,

29:11.840 --> 29:13.560
 when the environment is not right,

29:17.120 --> 29:19.760
 there's some aspect in which saying that drugs

29:19.760 --> 29:22.560
 can be used responsibly and effectively

29:22.560 --> 29:27.560
 and mostly positive can give those folks a pass

29:28.360 --> 29:30.600
 to use it instead of working on themselves

29:30.600 --> 29:32.840
 and fixing their environment first.

29:32.840 --> 29:35.280
 I don't know, what do you want me to say to that?

29:35.280 --> 29:37.280
 I mean, they have access to alcohol,

29:37.280 --> 29:38.680
 they have access to the...

29:39.640 --> 29:42.920
 You know, we live in this country called the United States

29:42.920 --> 29:45.280
 where our Declaration of Independence says

29:45.280 --> 29:48.400
 that we are free to live like we wanna live

29:48.400 --> 29:51.240
 so long as we don't disrupt other people

29:51.240 --> 29:52.400
 from doing the same.

29:53.440 --> 29:55.240
 But it's remarkable to me

29:55.240 --> 29:58.080
 how we try to control the behaviors of other people.

29:58.080 --> 30:00.720
 That's just remarkable.

30:00.720 --> 30:01.720
 Yeah.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.800
 And that's partially what your book is about.

30:03.800 --> 30:06.360
 I mean, it's not just about drugs, it's about freedom.

30:06.360 --> 30:09.120
 That's the bigger issue that we can't get to.

30:09.120 --> 30:12.280
 It's like this issue of freedom

30:12.280 --> 30:14.520
 and freedom comes with a tremendous amount

30:14.520 --> 30:15.960
 of responsibility.

30:15.960 --> 30:18.960
 I am responsible for my neighbors, my brothers.

30:18.960 --> 30:22.840
 I mean, I can't impede their freedoms.

30:22.840 --> 30:24.880
 Like some people think that their freedom

30:24.880 --> 30:26.680
 supersedes everybody else's freedoms.

30:26.680 --> 30:27.520
 No.

30:27.520 --> 30:30.920
 And that's what I'm trying to remind people in this book.

30:30.920 --> 30:35.920
 I am responsible to you as a citizen

30:36.800 --> 30:39.520
 and we're in this together.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.960
 And I tried to make that point in the book

30:41.960 --> 30:46.400
 and people have conveniently ignored things like that.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.640
 Do you think the war on drugs

30:49.640 --> 30:52.480
 has done more positive or negative for the world?

30:53.560 --> 30:55.480
 Depends on which world you live in.

30:55.480 --> 30:58.800
 The war on drugs has been hugely beneficial

30:58.800 --> 31:02.720
 to law enforcement, to the media,

31:02.720 --> 31:05.520
 to people who make bullshit TV shows.

31:06.760 --> 31:10.200
 The Sopranos, The Wire, all of those shows,

31:10.200 --> 31:12.800
 they benefit from this kind of nonsense.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.120
 Who else have benefited?

31:17.120 --> 31:19.760
 People who provide treatment,

31:19.760 --> 31:21.840
 many of them benefit from the war on drugs.

31:21.840 --> 31:25.480
 The folks who do urine testing for drugs,

31:25.480 --> 31:26.920
 they've all benefited.

31:26.920 --> 31:28.960
 They're making mad money.

31:28.960 --> 31:31.240
 People who run prisons,

31:31.240 --> 31:35.320
 the phone companies who charge the prisoners,

31:35.320 --> 31:38.640
 the people who run the hotels that are around the prisons

31:38.640 --> 31:41.360
 where people's family have to come and stay,

31:41.360 --> 31:45.840
 the restaurants, they are making out like bandits.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.960
 But many of us are getting screwed as a society.

31:49.960 --> 31:51.440
 In general, we're getting screwed,

31:51.440 --> 31:54.960
 but there are people who are just benefiting handsomely.

31:54.960 --> 31:56.320
 That's why it continues.

31:56.320 --> 31:58.000
 Politicians benefit.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.320
 I mean, whether you're Democrat or Republican,

32:00.320 --> 32:02.640
 you have the same stance on drugs anyway,

32:02.640 --> 32:05.800
 so they all benefit from this.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.520
 So many questions I want to ask you,

32:07.520 --> 32:08.880
 because you're challenging a lot of beliefs

32:08.880 --> 32:13.080
 that people have about drugs, about society in general.

32:13.080 --> 32:16.000
 So it's difficult for me to ask the right questions here.

32:18.000 --> 32:23.000
 If you were with a sort of a snap of a finger,

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
 change the world, what from a policy perspective would you,

32:28.960 --> 32:33.120
 and from just a, I don't know, human to human perspective,

32:33.120 --> 32:36.200
 what would you like to see in the United States of America

32:36.200 --> 32:37.920
 in terms of if that fixes some of the problems

32:37.920 --> 32:39.040
 we're discussing here?

32:39.040 --> 32:41.920
 First of all, we wouldn't be arresting anybody

32:41.920 --> 32:42.880
 for drugs anymore.

32:42.880 --> 32:45.040
 That would go away.

32:45.040 --> 32:48.440
 The folks who are in prison for drugs, that would go away.

32:48.440 --> 32:52.080
 Their records would be expunged, that would just go away.

32:52.080 --> 32:56.520
 And then we work on a system to make sure

32:56.520 --> 33:01.520
 that responsible adults can legally obtain these substances

33:02.440 --> 33:05.680
 and we'll have a corresponding educational system

33:05.680 --> 33:07.320
 to teach people how to do this.

33:08.800 --> 33:11.040
 That's where I would start initially.

33:12.400 --> 33:15.600
 Yeah, the arresting for drug use

33:15.600 --> 33:18.400
 or anything drug related is absurd,

33:18.400 --> 33:20.920
 especially in the context of hard destructive alcohol

33:20.920 --> 33:22.920
 and tobacco.

33:22.920 --> 33:25.000
 Alcohol can be destructive to some people,

33:25.000 --> 33:28.600
 but alcohol also is a hugely beneficial drug.

33:28.600 --> 33:31.240
 To be honest, which I couldn't have gotten through

33:31.240 --> 33:34.280
 many of the sort of receptions and functions

33:34.280 --> 33:37.640
 I had to go through as the chair of the department

33:37.640 --> 33:38.480
 without alcohol.

33:38.480 --> 33:41.120
 Yeah, you have a line I really liked.

33:41.120 --> 33:44.600
 The vast amount of predictably favorable drug effects

33:44.600 --> 33:47.880
 intrigued me, so much so that I expanded my own drug use

33:47.880 --> 33:49.360
 to take advantage of the wide array

33:49.360 --> 33:52.400
 of beneficial outcome specific drugs can offer.

33:52.400 --> 33:54.640
 The part that entertained me was this.

33:54.640 --> 33:56.160
 To put this in personal terms,

33:56.160 --> 34:00.600
 my position as department chairman from 2016 to 2019

34:00.600 --> 34:02.560
 was far more detrimental to my health

34:02.560 --> 34:04.360
 than my drug use ever was.

34:04.360 --> 34:07.520
 I mean, there is a standard we're treating drugs,

34:07.520 --> 34:10.200
 certain kinds of drugs that's completely different

34:10.200 --> 34:11.600
 than the standard we're treating everything else

34:11.600 --> 34:12.440
 in our lives.

34:13.680 --> 34:17.120
 Yeah, I mean, it's almost difficult to snap out of it

34:17.120 --> 34:19.800
 as I'm listening to you and reading your work.

34:24.280 --> 34:27.000
 It's difficult because it's like,

34:27.000 --> 34:31.800
 why is everybody living this idea that certain drugs

34:31.800 --> 34:35.560
 are so horribly destructive and others are not?

34:35.560 --> 34:37.680
 And we just kind of fix that idea.

34:37.680 --> 34:39.240
 And then there's this narrative,

34:41.120 --> 34:43.600
 I hate to be so cynical to think that there is just

34:43.600 --> 34:46.320
 like a system that just propagates narratives.

34:46.320 --> 34:50.240
 I always kind of think that truth wins out.

34:50.240 --> 34:51.480
 Truth is the best narrative.

34:51.480 --> 34:52.560
 I believe that too.

34:52.560 --> 34:54.920
 Obviously, that's why I'm out here and putting,

34:54.920 --> 34:58.240
 subjecting myself to this sort of criticism and so forth,

34:58.240 --> 35:01.160
 but because I believe that truth ultimately wins out,

35:01.160 --> 35:02.840
 but I might be wrong,

35:02.840 --> 35:07.800
 but I have to live my life like it's true.

35:07.800 --> 35:11.200
 Otherwise, then I have no hope, then why be here?

35:11.200 --> 35:12.840
 Well, kind of, if you can steal man

35:12.840 --> 35:15.520
 or at least show respect to a criticism,

35:15.520 --> 35:19.680
 you've I'm sure received quite a bit of criticism

35:19.680 --> 35:20.640
 for your work.

35:20.640 --> 35:23.760
 I've heard quite a bit of BS criticisms,

35:23.760 --> 35:27.040
 sort of ignorant stuff that don't actually pay attention

35:27.040 --> 35:30.200
 to your work, but is there some serious,

35:30.200 --> 35:34.160
 like is there some pushback that makes you think twice?

35:34.160 --> 35:39.160
 People say like, I'm presenting a too rosy picture of drugs.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.040
 I don't wanna do that.

35:42.040 --> 35:45.600
 I don't want people to think that I'm not aware of the

35:45.600 --> 35:49.280
 potential negative effects of any activity,

35:49.280 --> 35:51.200
 including drug use.

35:51.200 --> 35:56.200
 And so I do acknowledge that there are potential harms

35:56.680 --> 35:57.560
 associated with drugs.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.920
 I acknowledge that in the book,

35:59.920 --> 36:03.560
 but the fact remains the beneficial effects far outweigh

36:03.560 --> 36:05.400
 the potential harmful effects.

36:05.400 --> 36:09.720
 And we have technology information to help people

36:09.720 --> 36:12.200
 to minimize the likelihood of negative effects.

36:12.200 --> 36:16.680
 But this sort of approach that we have where we say

36:16.680 --> 36:20.360
 we're only exclusively presenting the harmful effects

36:20.360 --> 36:23.320
 and that should make people, keep people safe.

36:23.320 --> 36:25.480
 I just have a problem with that.

36:25.480 --> 36:30.480
 But I certainly, I take the point that people say

36:31.160 --> 36:32.200
 there are negative effects.

36:32.200 --> 36:35.160
 Absolutely, I absolutely agree.

36:35.160 --> 36:39.200
 What do you, if I can just talk about specific drugs,

36:39.200 --> 36:42.920
 what's the difference between opioids and benzos,

36:42.920 --> 36:47.440
 for example, specifically, I mean,

36:47.440 --> 36:50.680
 these are drugs that you often read about

36:50.680 --> 36:53.120
 being misused at scale.

36:53.120 --> 36:56.120
 I mean, the misuse is the problem, right?

36:56.120 --> 36:58.320
 No matter what the drug is.

36:58.320 --> 37:00.720
 And that's actually what you're pushing for is education

37:00.720 --> 37:03.720
 and it should be legal and should be good.

37:03.720 --> 37:08.600
 So people should know what's the difference in proper use,

37:08.600 --> 37:10.640
 positive use and misuse.

37:10.640 --> 37:13.960
 I mean, one public figure who has been going through this

37:13.960 --> 37:17.120
 is Jordan Peterson, he's been public about his struggle

37:17.120 --> 37:20.520
 of getting off benzos, the withdrawal he's going through.

37:20.520 --> 37:25.520
 I mean, what are your thoughts about the misuse of benzos

37:25.920 --> 37:30.000
 or opioids and so on, the epidemic that people talk about?

37:30.000 --> 37:33.200
 Yeah, I don't know Jordan's specific case,

37:33.200 --> 37:36.120
 but certainly with benzodiazepines in general,

37:36.120 --> 37:37.680
 we talked about withdrawal earlier.

37:37.680 --> 37:40.120
 When I said that with alcohol withdrawal, you can die.

37:40.120 --> 37:43.480
 So benzos and alcohol, they're closely related.

37:43.480 --> 37:47.360
 So benzo withdrawal too can kill you just like alcohol.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.160
 So when we think about the effects

37:49.160 --> 37:51.280
 that benzodiazepines produce,

37:51.280 --> 37:53.400
 think about the effects that alcohol produce,

37:53.400 --> 37:55.680
 they're comparable or similar.

37:55.680 --> 38:00.680
 And so I know that it's a difficult one to wean yourself off

38:01.360 --> 38:03.400
 if you develop the dependence,

38:03.400 --> 38:08.400
 but we have protocols for that and I hope he's okay.

38:09.560 --> 38:11.280
 It's interesting you say we have protocols for that,

38:11.280 --> 38:13.560
 but from my understanding was that

38:13.560 --> 38:16.080
 like the protocols aren't standardized.

38:16.080 --> 38:19.000
 It feels like a lot of doctors aren't as helpful

38:19.000 --> 38:20.800
 as they could be in this process.

38:20.800 --> 38:22.280
 Like it's a bit of a mess.

38:22.280 --> 38:23.920
 Certainly with withdrawal,

38:23.920 --> 38:27.040
 they're more standardized than anything.

38:27.040 --> 38:30.600
 So like if someone is going through alcohol withdrawal,

38:30.600 --> 38:33.600
 there is a standard protocol that most physicians

38:33.600 --> 38:36.040
 in this business, they follow.

38:36.040 --> 38:39.440
 The same is true with a benzo withdrawal.

38:39.440 --> 38:41.560
 But the thing where it gets murky

38:41.560 --> 38:44.080
 is when they're treating addiction itself.

38:44.080 --> 38:47.840
 So when you're thinking about the substance use disorder

38:47.840 --> 38:51.320
 in the DSM, not just withdrawal, but the entire addiction,

38:51.320 --> 38:56.320
 that's where you have this sort of a divergence

38:56.320 --> 39:00.480
 or diversity in terms of approaches.

39:00.480 --> 39:03.480
 And many of those approaches are rubbish.

39:03.480 --> 39:06.680
 Can you just elaborate like technically

39:06.680 --> 39:09.600
 what the term addiction means that you're referring to?

39:09.600 --> 39:11.000
 When I use the term addiction,

39:11.000 --> 39:16.000
 I'm referring to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual

39:16.400 --> 39:18.680
 of the American Psychiatric Association,

39:18.680 --> 39:20.960
 number five now, the DSM five.

39:20.960 --> 39:22.520
 That's never been wrong, right?

39:24.240 --> 39:25.080
 I'm just kidding.

39:25.080 --> 39:28.080
 You're absolutely, that point is well taken.

39:28.080 --> 39:33.040
 And your point is that their definition

39:33.040 --> 39:35.320
 of substance use disorder, that's addiction.

39:35.320 --> 39:36.520
 That's what I'm talking about.

39:36.520 --> 39:39.640
 But that definition continues to evolve.

39:39.640 --> 39:41.560
 And so you're right.

39:41.560 --> 39:44.120
 They still are working it out.

39:44.120 --> 39:47.240
 We're getting new information from scientific studies

39:47.240 --> 39:48.080
 and so forth.

39:48.080 --> 39:51.560
 And so it's supposed to be incorporated into the DSM,

39:51.560 --> 39:53.960
 but there are some problems with the DSM.

39:53.960 --> 39:58.920
 Like for example, they also have this sort of once an addict,

39:58.920 --> 40:00.560
 always an addict thing.

40:00.560 --> 40:05.200
 And there's no evidence to support that, but it's evolving.

40:05.200 --> 40:09.600
 And it's the definition that people in science

40:09.600 --> 40:10.880
 and medicine use.

40:10.880 --> 40:13.840
 And so we all know we're talking about the same language

40:13.840 --> 40:17.600
 when we call someone a substance use disorder patient

40:17.600 --> 40:19.680
 or someone who meets criteria for addiction.

40:19.680 --> 40:22.200
 We all are speaking the same language.

40:22.200 --> 40:24.800
 We're not saying that simply because this person

40:24.800 --> 40:26.600
 use heroin, they are an addict.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.040
 That's not what we're saying.

40:28.040 --> 40:32.120
 You have to meet these criteria where you have disruptions

40:32.120 --> 40:34.120
 in your psychosocial functioning.

40:34.120 --> 40:35.280
 That's one.

40:35.280 --> 40:39.440
 And two, you, the person are distressed

40:39.440 --> 40:43.160
 by these disruptions.

40:43.160 --> 40:46.520
 So people have to meet those two basic criteria

40:46.520 --> 40:48.680
 before we say they are addicted.

40:48.680 --> 40:53.680
 So once an addict, always an addict, this idea.

40:53.960 --> 40:57.880
 So I've, I mean, some of it is always mapped

40:57.880 --> 40:58.760
 to the person, all right.

40:58.760 --> 41:01.720
 But just the people I've interacted with

41:01.720 --> 41:04.080
 who have struggled with alcohol addiction,

41:04.080 --> 41:06.360
 I don't know what the proper term is.

41:06.360 --> 41:09.080
 It seems like with Alcohol Anonymous,

41:09.080 --> 41:14.080
 the process of putting that addiction behind you

41:14.800 --> 41:16.960
 is a very, very long process.

41:16.960 --> 41:18.800
 It's surprisingly long to me.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.640
 That almost seems like a whole life.

41:20.640 --> 41:24.200
 Like, he's not always an addict, but it takes decades.

41:24.200 --> 41:27.600
 It seems like, what is that?

41:27.600 --> 41:31.440
 What, can you maybe just, from your understanding

41:31.440 --> 41:33.320
 as a scientist, from your understanding as a human

41:33.320 --> 41:36.120
 who studies human nature, why does it take so long

41:36.120 --> 41:41.120
 to treat, to deal with that addiction?

41:42.920 --> 41:46.600
 Well, you cited Alcohol Anonymous, right?

41:46.600 --> 41:49.640
 And so I don't think of Alcohol Anonymous

41:49.640 --> 41:54.400
 as like a treatment that I would send any relative to,

41:54.400 --> 41:57.640
 like for a drug related problem.

41:57.640 --> 42:01.760
 I think Alcohol Anonymous AA is really good

42:01.760 --> 42:06.760
 for social interactions, making sure people

42:07.120 --> 42:10.360
 have a social group and they have peers.

42:10.360 --> 42:11.920
 I mean, that's a good thing.

42:11.920 --> 42:14.720
 We all need that social interaction.

42:14.720 --> 42:16.760
 But I don't think they know much about drugs.

42:16.760 --> 42:21.040
 That's not, it's like saying, well, you know,

42:21.040 --> 42:25.160
 my uncle broke his knee and he has this support group

42:25.160 --> 42:30.160
 and they said this, and then we follow that.

42:30.840 --> 42:31.960
 That doesn't make any sense.

42:31.960 --> 42:36.680
 But in our society, judges even sentence people

42:36.680 --> 42:39.040
 to go to AA.

42:39.040 --> 42:40.680
 Are you kidding me?

42:40.680 --> 42:44.920
 But that's the kind of thing that has been allowed to happen

42:44.920 --> 42:48.440
 in this society because we think of drugs

42:48.440 --> 42:51.840
 as this moral failing or drug addiction

42:51.840 --> 42:53.240
 as this moral failing.

42:54.120 --> 42:56.600
 And any idiot can provide treatment

42:56.600 --> 43:00.760
 and no disrespect to AA because I think what they do

43:00.760 --> 43:02.880
 is a lot more than what some people do

43:02.880 --> 43:05.920
 because at least they have this social,

43:05.920 --> 43:09.720
 these social interactions, you have a social group.

43:09.720 --> 43:12.520
 That's better than what a lot of these other idiots

43:12.520 --> 43:13.640
 out here do.

43:13.640 --> 43:18.440
 Well, and that social support group unrelated to the drug,

43:18.440 --> 43:20.960
 it helps cure some of the environment issues

43:20.960 --> 43:21.800
 you might be in.

43:21.800 --> 43:23.000
 That's the whole point.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.120
 So we kind of coupled the drug to the environment,

43:25.120 --> 43:28.400
 but the reality is, as you argue,

43:28.400 --> 43:31.000
 most of the problems come from the environment.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.960
 Certainly with people who are experiencing

43:32.960 --> 43:34.800
 drug related problem with most of the people,

43:34.800 --> 43:36.840
 not all, but most.

43:36.840 --> 43:40.800
 There are differences like that psychedelics

43:40.800 --> 43:43.880
 and like psilocybin has versus alcohol.

43:43.880 --> 43:48.880
 I personally think I've enjoyed both experiences

43:49.200 --> 43:50.320
 in different ways.

43:51.200 --> 43:54.920
 Is it possible or are we getting into the realm of poetry

43:54.920 --> 43:59.480
 to describe the benefits, like how it alters the mind,

43:59.480 --> 44:02.040
 how the different drugs alter the mind

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
 and the places it can take you

44:05.000 --> 44:06.800
 that produce a positive experience?

44:06.800 --> 44:09.480
 Yeah, no, it's very real.

44:09.480 --> 44:14.480
 Like some drugs take people in places that other drugs can

44:14.840 --> 44:17.000
 and that's very real.

44:17.000 --> 44:21.560
 I have friends, some of them you know,

44:21.560 --> 44:26.560
 they, for example, say that they've never had an experience

44:27.560 --> 44:29.760
 like the one they had with ayahuasca

44:29.760 --> 44:32.200
 and they've done a number of sort of things,

44:32.200 --> 44:37.200
 but they did the ayahuasca in a setting with a shaman

44:38.120 --> 44:43.120
 and this group and they felt like they actually began

44:45.400 --> 44:47.560
 to heal or solve some problems

44:47.560 --> 44:50.960
 that they were trying to solve for some years.

44:50.960 --> 44:54.000
 And that's great, that's great for them.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.600
 And nothing else does it for them like that.

44:56.600 --> 44:59.120
 And that's absolutely fantastic.

44:59.120 --> 45:04.120
 All I argue is that if that kind of thing happens for you

45:06.880 --> 45:09.520
 with ayahuasca, with psilocybin,

45:09.520 --> 45:12.320
 with some other psychedelic,

45:12.320 --> 45:16.880
 why isn't it possible that heroin does that for someone

45:16.880 --> 45:19.600
 or cocaine does that for someone else

45:19.600 --> 45:23.240
 or MDMA does it for someone, that's it.

45:23.240 --> 45:27.280
 That's interesting to imagine like a shaman for heroin.

45:27.280 --> 45:29.120
 Like why not?

45:29.120 --> 45:31.480
 Or cocaine, you said creating an environment for yourself,

45:31.480 --> 45:33.960
 for use of these different substances

45:33.960 --> 45:38.960
 and that environment has a very strong impact

45:39.600 --> 45:41.720
 on the actual experience that you have.

45:41.720 --> 45:46.720
 But I mean, so cocaine is an upper and then.

45:47.320 --> 45:50.840
 Yeah, the way we define drugs like uppers and downers,

45:50.840 --> 45:55.840
 that's a really kind of inappropriate way

45:55.840 --> 45:57.320
 but it's a quick way.

45:57.320 --> 46:01.000
 So we certainly say cocaine is an upper or stimulant.

46:01.000 --> 46:05.120
 But it depends on the activity of the person

46:05.120 --> 46:06.200
 before they take the drug.

46:06.200 --> 46:08.280
 Say like if you're like really active

46:08.280 --> 46:10.560
 before taking a drug like cocaine,

46:10.560 --> 46:12.640
 it might actually calm you.

46:12.640 --> 46:15.440
 So it all depends on the activity of the person

46:15.440 --> 46:16.720
 before they take the drug.

46:16.720 --> 46:19.800
 I remember, I don't know if you know Matthew Johnson is.

46:19.800 --> 46:21.320
 Of course.

46:21.320 --> 46:22.840
 He did all these studies on,

46:22.840 --> 46:25.040
 or I remember just reading a paper,

46:25.040 --> 46:27.040
 I didn't get a chance to talk with him much about it,

46:27.040 --> 46:30.560
 but it was about condom use and cocaine.

46:30.560 --> 46:33.080
 And then like the doses

46:33.080 --> 46:35.480
 and whether people are more or less likely.

46:35.480 --> 46:40.320
 Like the unsafe thing there is the using or not using,

46:40.320 --> 46:45.320
 or not using, I guess, condoms during sexual intercourse.

46:45.480 --> 46:48.040
 I don't know, I just, I love that these drugs

46:48.040 --> 46:52.000
 that have connotation probably because of Hollywood,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.520
 negative connotations are actually being studied by science.

46:54.520 --> 46:56.360
 And then the actual impact they have,

46:56.360 --> 46:57.960
 and what are the negative effects.

46:57.960 --> 47:00.000
 Again, in those studies often,

47:01.240 --> 47:05.080
 the positive effects are difficult to quantify, I think.

47:05.080 --> 47:08.080
 Maybe I guess you can from self report and so on.

47:08.080 --> 47:11.120
 Positive effects are not difficult to quantify.

47:11.120 --> 47:15.200
 You ask people about their euphoria,

47:15.200 --> 47:18.040
 you can see how well people are getting along.

47:18.040 --> 47:22.560
 Like in our studies that we have people sometimes in groups

47:22.560 --> 47:25.520
 and you see how well they get along

47:25.520 --> 47:29.720
 on the various drug conditions or placebo conditions.

47:29.720 --> 47:32.240
 It's really, it's not that difficult.

47:32.240 --> 47:34.360
 And then you can see these amazing studies

47:34.360 --> 47:37.960
 with like Rick Doblin, like the looking at MDMA

47:37.960 --> 47:40.560
 and combined with therapy,

47:41.920 --> 47:44.760
 like how you can overcome certain PTSD things

47:44.760 --> 47:46.920
 or depression and so on.

47:46.920 --> 47:48.280
 Yeah, it's really interesting.

47:48.280 --> 47:50.840
 It's really interesting.

47:50.840 --> 47:53.400
 I had to ask you, cause you mentioned The Wire.

47:53.400 --> 47:56.280
 Do you think The Wire, you think movies like Trainspotting,

47:56.280 --> 47:58.080
 do you think they're ultimately destroying?

47:58.080 --> 47:58.920
 Cause okay.

47:59.960 --> 48:02.160
 Yes, they celebrate murder, right?

48:02.160 --> 48:04.240
 The Godfather a little bit.

48:04.240 --> 48:05.080
 Yeah.

48:05.080 --> 48:07.240
 But another one, I mean,

48:07.240 --> 48:10.080
 it's like these racist ass motherfuckers

48:10.080 --> 48:12.600
 and they also are killing people,

48:12.600 --> 48:14.720
 but yet they say, we don't do drugs.

48:14.720 --> 48:16.120
 What kind of shit is that?

48:16.120 --> 48:21.120
 I mean, people who are doing drugs, psilocybin or whatever.

48:21.480 --> 48:24.480
 The thing is we're trying to be better people

48:24.480 --> 48:27.080
 and trying to make our society better

48:27.080 --> 48:28.160
 and you're killing people

48:28.160 --> 48:32.280
 and you are denigrating people for using drugs.

48:32.280 --> 48:33.440
 Are you fucking kidding me?

48:33.440 --> 48:35.920
 And we let them get away with that as a society.

48:35.920 --> 48:37.160
 Do you see those movies?

48:37.160 --> 48:39.680
 I apologize if I'm not sufficiently informed.

48:39.680 --> 48:41.720
 You see them as denigrating drugs?

48:41.720 --> 48:42.560
 Of course.

48:42.560 --> 48:44.720
 I mean, The Godfather.

48:44.720 --> 48:45.560
 Yes, that's right.

48:45.560 --> 48:46.400
 That's a good example.

48:46.400 --> 48:49.520
 The Godfather, The Sopranos is all about that.

48:49.520 --> 48:53.600
 I mean, Christopher is using heroin in The Sopranos

48:53.600 --> 48:58.440
 and they have an intervention in one season

48:58.440 --> 49:02.880
 and they are denigrating him.

49:02.880 --> 49:03.720
 Are you kidding me?

49:03.720 --> 49:05.640
 You just cut somebody's head off.

49:05.640 --> 49:07.840
 Yeah, but they're, to be fair,

49:07.840 --> 49:10.520
 they were denigrating, I think, all drugs.

49:10.520 --> 49:13.080
 And then they're drinking alcohol in the butterbeam.

49:13.080 --> 49:13.920
 Yeah, yeah.

49:13.920 --> 49:18.120
 Come on, I mean, first of all, they're killing people.

49:18.120 --> 49:21.320
 They don't have any space, none,

49:21.320 --> 49:23.760
 to denigrate somebody who's just trying

49:23.760 --> 49:26.520
 to alter their consciousness.

49:26.520 --> 49:27.520
 Are you kidding me?

49:27.520 --> 49:29.600
 And not bothering anyone else.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.400
 But there's a lot of other mob movies

49:31.400 --> 49:35.960
 that Scarface celebrates the murder and the drugs equally.

49:35.960 --> 49:39.280
 So, I mean, it doesn't,

49:39.280 --> 49:44.280
 it celebrates all of the, not just drugs or so on,

49:44.360 --> 49:45.200
 it's extreme.

49:45.200 --> 49:46.760
 All of those movies, you know,

49:46.760 --> 49:48.000
 I loved all those movies.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.080
 I'm from Miami, I loved Scarface.

49:50.080 --> 49:52.440
 I even liked The Sopranos that I started looking

49:52.440 --> 49:55.200
 at that shit with a critical eye and see what it's doing.

49:56.520 --> 50:01.520
 But Scarface is dependent upon the American viewer

50:02.560 --> 50:06.240
 having a certain view of people who deal in drugs.

50:06.240 --> 50:10.560
 And that view is that these people are animals, basically.

50:10.560 --> 50:14.000
 And in the end, the animal kills himself

50:14.000 --> 50:16.720
 with too much cocaine and he was high.

50:16.720 --> 50:17.880
 That's what they show.

50:17.880 --> 50:20.680
 And so it's like, what the fuck?

50:20.680 --> 50:22.120
 So it's leveraging, it's playing

50:22.120 --> 50:26.040
 into not the better angels of our nature.

50:31.000 --> 50:31.840
 The question.

50:31.840 --> 50:34.080
 Don't take away these great movies from me.

50:34.080 --> 50:36.360
 But it's true, you have to think about them critically

50:36.360 --> 50:37.200
 in the context.

50:37.200 --> 50:38.800
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

50:38.800 --> 50:39.640
 I like these movies.

50:39.640 --> 50:41.080
 It's not a matter of taking away.

50:41.080 --> 50:45.920
 It's a matter of making the writers be more honest

50:45.920 --> 50:46.960
 to the reality.

50:46.960 --> 50:47.800
 That's it.

50:47.800 --> 50:48.640
 That's true.

50:48.640 --> 50:49.480
 That's really true.

50:49.480 --> 50:52.080
 And the writers, the people, the culture, all of it.

50:52.080 --> 50:54.240
 I mean, they write these things.

50:54.240 --> 50:57.000
 I just think about some hip hop artists.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.640
 They say like, this is real.

50:58.640 --> 51:01.240
 This is my experience and so forth.

51:01.240 --> 51:02.960
 And that's how these movie writers,

51:02.960 --> 51:06.160
 they write this bullshit and then say, well, this is real.

51:07.440 --> 51:10.440
 Anyway, I get so upset talking about it

51:10.440 --> 51:12.920
 because I know the harm it's doing.

51:12.920 --> 51:16.200
 And I know those kinds of movies are the reason

51:16.200 --> 51:18.800
 that we have this war on drugs.

51:18.800 --> 51:21.360
 And all of these people are going to jail

51:21.360 --> 51:23.160
 because of those kinds of movies.

51:24.560 --> 51:28.400
 In the epilogue of your book, you quote James Baldwin.

51:28.400 --> 51:31.120
 You cannot know what you will discover on the journey,

51:31.120 --> 51:33.560
 what you will do with what you find

51:33.560 --> 51:36.600
 or what you find will do to you.

51:36.600 --> 51:40.600
 So let me ask, how has drug use or the study of drugs

51:40.600 --> 51:42.920
 changed you as a human being?

51:42.920 --> 51:46.520
 It has helped me think about other people's experience.

51:46.520 --> 51:51.040
 So how we're all connected, like going to Northern Ireland.

51:51.040 --> 51:53.480
 I don't know if you know much about the situation

51:53.480 --> 51:57.000
 with the troubles and what those people went through.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.760
 And so I see people there.

51:59.760 --> 52:02.240
 Northern Ireland, by the way, is all white.

52:02.240 --> 52:04.840
 And you see those people there suffering

52:04.840 --> 52:08.200
 for the same reasons that people in Appalachia

52:08.200 --> 52:09.880
 are suffering for.

52:09.880 --> 52:14.640
 Neglected by politicians who told them lies about drugs

52:14.640 --> 52:16.560
 and not dealing with the real problems,

52:16.560 --> 52:19.000
 like West Virginia, for example.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.440
 Their water's polluted, the factories have gone away,

52:22.440 --> 52:25.920
 people are desperate and they're blaming drugs.

52:25.920 --> 52:27.560
 Are you kidding me?

52:27.560 --> 52:31.360
 So the politicians don't have to bring back the jobs.

52:31.360 --> 52:34.320
 So we don't have to really make sure

52:34.320 --> 52:37.560
 they have clean drinking water, things of that nature.

52:37.560 --> 52:39.360
 And so those people are connected

52:39.360 --> 52:40.720
 to the people in Northern Ireland.

52:40.720 --> 52:43.640
 They're connected to the people in Brownsville.

52:43.640 --> 52:46.840
 They're connected to the people in other places

52:46.840 --> 52:49.120
 in the United States for the same reason.

52:49.120 --> 52:54.640
 They're connected to the people in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

52:54.640 --> 52:58.320
 Same thing, people are catching hell for the same reason

52:58.320 --> 53:01.360
 in the Philippines for the same reason.

53:01.360 --> 53:04.920
 And that's why I feel so strongly about this thing

53:04.920 --> 53:08.600
 because I know there are people getting paid

53:08.600 --> 53:13.200
 and their paycheck is predicated on subjugating

53:13.200 --> 53:15.200
 and the suffering of those other people.

53:17.520 --> 53:21.920
 So when we hear about the destructive effects of drugs,

53:21.920 --> 53:28.000
 it's essentially a scapegoat for the failures of leaders

53:28.000 --> 53:30.920
 and politicians to help alleviate the suffering

53:30.920 --> 53:31.760
 of people in those communities.

53:31.760 --> 53:34.560
 Absolutely, it's so easy to say,

53:34.560 --> 53:36.800
 I'm gonna rid your community of drugs.

53:36.800 --> 53:38.640
 I'm gonna put more cops on the street.

53:40.360 --> 53:45.000
 If you want a problem not to be solved,

53:45.000 --> 53:47.280
 just give it to the military or the cops.

53:48.280 --> 53:51.760
 You had a tough childhood growing up in Miami, like you said.

53:51.760 --> 53:56.720
 What memory stands out in particular that was formative

53:56.720 --> 53:59.240
 and helping make you the man you are?

54:00.520 --> 54:08.480
 That's so hard to say, my grandmother was really important.

54:08.480 --> 54:13.200
 So maybe just her trying to make sure that I think critically,

54:13.200 --> 54:14.640
 I guess that's the biggest one.

54:15.520 --> 54:18.200
 So you moved in with your parents split?

54:19.320 --> 54:20.760
 Six, seven, yeah.

54:20.760 --> 54:23.520
 What have you learned about life from her?

54:23.520 --> 54:28.320
 Be self sufficient, be critical and keep your eyes open

54:28.320 --> 54:30.760
 and watch out for the okie doke.

54:30.760 --> 54:33.440
 And that's what this whole drug thing is about.

54:33.440 --> 54:38.280
 It's the okie doke, people, it really boils down

54:38.280 --> 54:40.120
 to just simple thing.

54:40.120 --> 54:43.800
 We're all similar in that we're all just trying

54:43.800 --> 54:46.240
 to live our life, trying to take care of our kids.

54:46.240 --> 54:48.680
 We want the best for our kids, all of us.

54:48.680 --> 54:54.480
 But yet somehow we've been made to believe

54:54.480 --> 54:56.720
 that we're different in that way.

54:56.720 --> 54:58.680
 But fundamentally, we're all the same.

54:58.680 --> 55:04.160
 So when people are seeking to feel pleasure, to feel better,

55:05.120 --> 55:06.800
 why don't we celebrate that?

55:06.800 --> 55:10.480
 Instead, we denigrate people for that.

55:10.480 --> 55:15.240
 I mean, if I feel better, I'm more likely to treat you well.

55:15.240 --> 55:19.960
 I got to say still, though, you're going against the grain

55:19.960 --> 55:25.480
 and you're at Columbia, it takes a lot of guts

55:25.480 --> 55:29.280
 to sort of speak out about these ideas so boldly.

55:29.280 --> 55:32.360
 I don't know how to ask this question.

55:32.360 --> 55:34.160
 Where do you find the guts?

55:34.160 --> 55:39.320
 What, because it's also perhaps inspirational to others

55:39.320 --> 55:41.720
 in different disciplines that are sort of taking

55:41.720 --> 55:43.920
 on the conventional wisdom of the day.

55:43.920 --> 55:47.040
 And challenging it, what does it take to do that?

55:47.040 --> 55:50.800
 What advice would you give to others like you kind

55:50.800 --> 55:52.680
 of a little bit afraid to do so?

55:52.680 --> 55:56.320
 Once you know, you cannot not know, as they say.

55:56.320 --> 55:58.040
 And so I have to look in the mirror.

55:58.040 --> 56:01.720
 And then looking in the mirror, I have to face myself.

56:01.720 --> 56:03.880
 Have I lived honestly?

56:03.880 --> 56:10.520
 And if I can't face myself, then what am I doing here?

56:10.520 --> 56:14.640
 You know, that's how I see it.

56:14.640 --> 56:19.120
 One of the things that people don't really talk about

56:19.120 --> 56:23.720
 with drugs and people who die from some drug related death.

56:23.720 --> 56:27.200
 And I've been thinking about this a whole lot

56:27.200 --> 56:28.800
 over the past couple of years.

56:28.800 --> 56:33.120
 It's like some of these drugs can take you to a place

56:33.120 --> 56:37.520
 where you feel so optimistic and positive about humans,

56:37.520 --> 56:39.200
 our fellow humans.

56:39.200 --> 56:43.560
 And you want to do your best to contribute.

56:43.560 --> 56:46.120
 And because you know the possibilities

56:46.120 --> 56:49.760
 of what we can be as a society.

56:49.760 --> 56:54.040
 And then you come up with resistance and you, like you say,

56:54.040 --> 56:55.920
 there are a lot, there's a lot of resistance

56:55.920 --> 56:58.440
 and people just have a hard time.

56:58.440 --> 57:03.640
 And so if you know humans can be better

57:03.640 --> 57:07.720
 and they refuse to be better, why be here

57:07.720 --> 57:12.080
 as someone who knows that we can do this better?

57:12.080 --> 57:15.520
 I certainly don't want to do it the way we're doing it.

57:15.520 --> 57:19.680
 So you kind of see drugs as mechanisms

57:19.680 --> 57:21.720
 for potentially elevating the human spirit,

57:21.720 --> 57:24.440
 sort of making people feel better.

57:24.440 --> 57:26.960
 So you want to communicate that message.

57:26.960 --> 57:32.440
 So it's that plus the fact that drugs are used as scapegoat

57:32.440 --> 57:36.520
 to not alleviate the suffering of certain communities.

57:36.520 --> 57:38.320
 So those two things come together.

57:38.320 --> 57:41.440
 One of the sort of main points of the book too

57:41.440 --> 57:45.760
 was to try and get people to understand the possibilities

57:45.760 --> 57:52.480
 that we could have if we embraced certain drug use.

57:52.480 --> 57:56.720
 If we allowed adults to do this sort of thing.

57:56.720 --> 58:01.400
 Relationships can be better.

58:01.400 --> 58:04.200
 A wide range of beneficial effects.

58:04.200 --> 58:09.880
 People would be, or can learn to be more magnanimous.

58:09.880 --> 58:15.040
 All of these pro social things that we say we value.

58:15.040 --> 58:16.520
 In your previous book, High Price,

58:16.520 --> 58:21.280
 you talk about rap and DJing, chapter five.

58:21.280 --> 58:24.960
 There's a nice picture of you DJing from 1983.

58:24.960 --> 58:28.000
 So let me ask who in your view,

58:28.000 --> 58:30.400
 this is the toughest question of this interview,

58:30.400 --> 58:32.440
 is the greatest hip hop artist of all time?

58:32.440 --> 58:34.280
 Maybe give some candidates.

58:34.280 --> 58:35.080
 Oh, wow.

58:35.080 --> 58:37.840
 Who is the greatest hip hop artist?

58:37.840 --> 58:40.240
 I don't know if I'm qualified to make that bag

58:40.240 --> 58:47.600
 because I have to go back to like Gil Scott Heron.

58:47.600 --> 58:52.960
 Like people think of him as one of the fathers of hip hop.

58:52.960 --> 58:56.200
 That's my all time favorite.

58:56.200 --> 58:58.720
 People like Chuck D from Public Enemy.

58:58.720 --> 59:00.520
 Some of the things that they were doing,

59:00.520 --> 59:04.160
 I was really digging, but even though I was digging

59:04.160 --> 59:08.880
 like Public Enemy, but even they got it wrong on drugs.

59:08.880 --> 59:12.200
 Even Gil Scott Heron got it wrong on drugs.

59:12.200 --> 59:16.280
 But they were doing so much other good stuff.

59:16.280 --> 59:20.720
 It helped me to develop as a person.

59:20.720 --> 59:29.200
 And so I think like my son is a hip hop artist now.

59:29.200 --> 59:31.840
 I think those folks who are in the game now,

59:31.840 --> 59:35.360
 they are a lot more qualified to talk about who's

59:35.360 --> 59:37.680
 the greatest hip hop artist.

59:37.680 --> 59:38.800
 I'm not qualified.

59:38.800 --> 59:41.240
 The evolution, I mean, have you tracked the evolution

59:41.240 --> 59:45.800
 from sort of the 90s with Wu Tang and Tupac and Biggie

59:45.800 --> 59:48.160
 and then to what we have today?

59:48.160 --> 59:50.800
 So there's just been a crazy amount of progress.

59:50.800 --> 59:52.680
 It's like almost difficult to track.

59:52.680 --> 59:55.480
 Yeah, I mean, I really love what they're doing.

59:55.480 --> 59:59.280
 I like what they accept the part where they get over 40

59:59.280 --> 1:00:01.520
 and they become fucking cops on TV.

1:00:01.520 --> 1:00:05.320
 I mean, other than that, I dig what's that about.

1:00:05.320 --> 1:00:08.000
 Yeah, I don't understand that, but that's what they do.

1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:13.720
 Again, this sort of glorification of cops,

1:00:13.720 --> 1:00:16.280
 that's dangerous for a society.

1:00:16.280 --> 1:00:19.280
 And those cats who do that kind of thing,

1:00:19.280 --> 1:00:21.000
 I have a problem with that.

1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:23.520
 Is it all sort of to push back a little bit?

1:00:23.520 --> 1:00:25.120
 Because I come from the Soviet Union

1:00:25.120 --> 1:00:26.880
 where there's a huge amount of corruption.

1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:30.640
 And when I see what's going on with cops in this country,

1:00:30.640 --> 1:00:32.880
 there's a lot of proper criticism you can apply,

1:00:32.880 --> 1:00:36.120
 but like relative to other places,

1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:40.560
 this is, well, on so many ways, this country is incredible.

1:00:40.560 --> 1:00:44.040
 Is your criticism towards cops

1:00:44.040 --> 1:00:46.320
 or towards what cops are asked to do?

1:00:46.320 --> 1:00:49.560
 Yeah, towards what cops are asked to do.

1:00:49.560 --> 1:00:54.560
 Cops provide the shield for politicians and those in power.

1:00:54.560 --> 1:00:57.120
 Absolutely, because I was in the military,

1:00:57.120 --> 1:00:58.760
 I spent four years in the military

1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:00.880
 and I did what I was told to do.

1:01:00.880 --> 1:01:06.000
 And I was ignorant and thought I was doing the right thing.

1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:08.240
 And I did what I was told to do.

1:01:08.240 --> 1:01:11.640
 And so just like these guys are doing what they're told to do.

1:01:11.640 --> 1:01:15.160
 But no, my real beef is with the power structure,

1:01:15.160 --> 1:01:17.640
 the folks who are telling them what to do.

1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:22.640
 And also the folks who go play cops on television.

1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:27.640
 That imagery, that sort of glorifying cops,

1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.560
 that's a problem in a democracy.

1:01:30.560 --> 1:01:32.680
 Yeah, all sides of the glorification

1:01:32.680 --> 1:01:35.160
 of the drug war is a problem.

1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:36.000
 Yeah.

1:01:37.520 --> 1:01:40.240
 If I can just linger on a little longer

1:01:40.240 --> 1:01:42.360
 in terms of the effects of drugs,

1:01:42.360 --> 1:01:46.560
 on the positive like mind expanding components of it,

1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:51.560
 what have mind altering drugs teach you

1:01:53.840 --> 1:01:55.240
 about the human mind?

1:01:55.240 --> 1:01:59.920
 Sort of from a neuroscience, not even like a biochemical,

1:01:59.920 --> 1:02:02.960
 but just like the human mind is amazing, right?

1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:04.400
 The places it can go.

1:02:06.280 --> 1:02:09.040
 Like, are there some insights you've learned

1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:11.200
 from studying drugs about the mind?

1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:15.000
 Yeah, can I start from a neurochemical perspective first

1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:16.720
 and then we'll go larger?

1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:19.280
 Just from a neurochemical perspective.

1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:22.440
 I mean, everything I know about the brain,

1:02:22.440 --> 1:02:25.800
 I learned through drugs because of my interest in drugs.

1:02:25.800 --> 1:02:28.280
 So I learned a lot about dopamine neurons

1:02:28.280 --> 1:02:30.840
 in certain regions of the brain, about neuro epinephrine

1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:35.840
 neurons and a wide range of other sort of neural transmission

1:02:35.840 --> 1:02:37.120
 happened because of drugs.

1:02:37.120 --> 1:02:41.800
 And so that's a really valuable tool, lessons for me.

1:02:41.800 --> 1:02:45.160
 But then when we think that we move out a bit

1:02:45.160 --> 1:02:46.360
 and we think more globally,

1:02:46.360 --> 1:02:50.240
 what have I learned in terms of the mind from drugs?

1:02:52.720 --> 1:02:57.720
 I have really learned how to be more forgiving of people

1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:04.800
 and myself and tolerant, more tolerant of people

1:03:06.680 --> 1:03:10.680
 and certainly learned a lot more about empathy

1:03:10.680 --> 1:03:13.840
 as a result of drug use.

1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:21.000
 And like I said earlier, I'm learning what we can be

1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:24.960
 as a species and it's quite incredible,

1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:27.520
 but because of drugs.

1:03:27.520 --> 1:03:29.920
 Yeah, there's a certain property of drugs in different ways.

1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:31.280
 They take you out of your body,

1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:34.600
 like they help you evaluate yourself

1:03:34.600 --> 1:03:36.640
 from like a third person perspective.

1:03:36.640 --> 1:03:38.560
 It's almost like you have a consciousness in here

1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:41.040
 and you get to step outside of it a little bit.

1:03:41.040 --> 1:03:42.960
 I mean, that's kind of what meditation does too.

1:03:42.960 --> 1:03:44.560
 All of these processes,

1:03:44.560 --> 1:03:47.320
 that's what a hell of a good workout does too.

1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:50.640
 It makes you evaluate yourself and then somehow

1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:54.840
 that allows you to be forgiving to yourself

1:03:54.840 --> 1:03:57.680
 and forgiving to others, sort of empathize.

1:03:57.680 --> 1:03:59.720
 It trains that part of your brain.

1:03:59.720 --> 1:04:01.240
 So stepping outside of yourself,

1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:03.760
 not taking yourself too seriously, that process.

1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:06.280
 And different drugs do that in different ways.

1:04:06.280 --> 1:04:07.920
 Obviously, I don't know from personal experience

1:04:07.920 --> 1:04:12.920
 on some of them, but I'm now curious,

1:04:14.680 --> 1:04:18.760
 it's unfortunate that the Hollywood and different stories

1:04:18.760 --> 1:04:23.760
 we have demonize certain drugs and sort of basically,

1:04:23.800 --> 1:04:25.440
 I don't know, make it difficult for people like me

1:04:25.440 --> 1:04:28.440
 to explore those ideas, but then I'm really thankful

1:04:28.440 --> 1:04:30.600
 for people like you who are pushing the science forward

1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:33.120
 and are unafraid to talk about this kind of stuff.

1:04:34.960 --> 1:04:36.840
 Cause I'm really fascinated with consciousness

1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:38.160
 on the engineering side.

1:04:38.160 --> 1:04:42.080
 I really want to build robots that have elements

1:04:42.080 --> 1:04:45.040
 of intelligence, emotion, even consciousness.

1:04:45.040 --> 1:04:47.640
 And for that, we need to understand it in ourselves

1:04:47.640 --> 1:04:51.080
 and drugs is all the different kinds of drugs.

1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:53.920
 If you safely seems like an incredible tool

1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:55.600
 to understand ourselves.

1:04:55.600 --> 1:04:58.080
 And if we're limiting ourselves from certain drugs

1:04:58.080 --> 1:05:01.600
 because of certain political games that are being played,

1:05:01.600 --> 1:05:03.200
 it's sad.

1:05:03.200 --> 1:05:06.880
 And people know this, a lot of middle to upper class

1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:10.520
 people know this, the illicit drug trade business

1:05:10.520 --> 1:05:12.760
 is a multi million dollar industry,

1:05:12.760 --> 1:05:17.080
 multi billion dollar industry that could not be supported

1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:19.080
 by people who are poor.

1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:23.800
 And that has to be supported by a lot of customers.

1:05:23.800 --> 1:05:27.640
 And a lot of people around the world know this,

1:05:27.640 --> 1:05:30.080
 they're in the closet and in the book,

1:05:30.080 --> 1:05:32.680
 I call for them to get out of the closet.

1:05:32.680 --> 1:05:35.280
 So we can start being more honest

1:05:35.280 --> 1:05:38.440
 and we can take the pressure off of those people

1:05:38.440 --> 1:05:40.720
 who are not as privileged.

1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:43.720
 Like I said, you're brave, you're bold.

1:05:43.720 --> 1:05:45.560
 I gotta ask you for some advice.

1:05:45.560 --> 1:05:48.080
 What advice would you give to a young person today?

1:05:48.080 --> 1:05:52.040
 High school, maybe undergrad, college,

1:05:52.040 --> 1:05:54.280
 thinking about their career,

1:05:54.280 --> 1:05:57.560
 thinking about how to live a life they can be proud of.

1:05:57.560 --> 1:06:00.200
 Yeah, whatever career they choose,

1:06:00.200 --> 1:06:03.600
 just make sure that they dedicate themselves to it

1:06:03.600 --> 1:06:06.400
 and be the best at what they do first.

1:06:06.400 --> 1:06:08.720
 That's what you have to do first.

1:06:08.720 --> 1:06:13.240
 Like people see me advocating for this position.

1:06:13.240 --> 1:06:18.240
 30 years of science is in these opinions, this view.

1:06:18.760 --> 1:06:21.280
 And trust me, I would be dismissed

1:06:21.280 --> 1:06:24.040
 if I didn't know my shit, if I was not.

1:06:24.040 --> 1:06:26.200
 Yeah, you did the work, you proved yourself,

1:06:26.200 --> 1:06:30.480
 you're legit by the people in the eyes of the people

1:06:30.480 --> 1:06:31.320
 who know.

1:06:31.320 --> 1:06:33.360
 Absolutely, so that's the main thing

1:06:33.360 --> 1:06:34.920
 that I would encourage people to do,

1:06:34.920 --> 1:06:36.480
 really know your craft.

1:06:36.480 --> 1:06:38.680
 If you know your craft,

1:06:38.680 --> 1:06:42.240
 and then maybe you will be a service

1:06:42.240 --> 1:06:45.880
 to your fellow citizens.

1:06:45.880 --> 1:06:48.240
 There are so many people out here faking the funk

1:06:48.240 --> 1:06:50.360
 and they don't know their craft

1:06:50.360 --> 1:06:52.920
 and they're not a service to the people

1:06:52.920 --> 1:06:54.560
 that they claim to serve.

1:06:54.560 --> 1:06:55.800
 And that's a problem.

1:06:55.800 --> 1:06:59.280
 And when you have a fair number of people

1:06:59.280 --> 1:07:01.960
 like that in positions of power,

1:07:01.960 --> 1:07:03.880
 your society is going to crumble.

1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:06.840
 What about the scientific path?

1:07:06.840 --> 1:07:08.680
 You recommend people get a PhD?

1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:13.040
 Not necessarily, like my own children,

1:07:13.040 --> 1:07:14.400
 I don't recommend that.

1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:19.200
 So science can, certainly my science

1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:22.360
 can be a very petty sort of space to be in.

1:07:22.360 --> 1:07:26.720
 But it was the only sort of path that I had.

1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:29.040
 And so I had to do it.

1:07:29.040 --> 1:07:34.040
 But no, I would really encourage people

1:07:34.560 --> 1:07:38.160
 to just do something that they enjoy

1:07:38.160 --> 1:07:40.520
 and something that makes them happy.

1:07:40.520 --> 1:07:45.520
 Because the greater number of happy people in our society,

1:07:45.920 --> 1:07:47.920
 the better off we all are.

1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:51.000
 All right, since you mentioned happiness,

1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.360
 gotta ask you about the pursuit of happiness

1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:57.160
 and the ridiculous question about meaning.

1:07:57.160 --> 1:07:59.240
 Do you think this life has meaning?

1:07:59.240 --> 1:08:01.200
 What do you think is the meaning of life?

1:08:01.200 --> 1:08:02.880
 I'm sorry.

1:08:02.880 --> 1:08:04.560
 I certainly hope it has meaning.

1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:07.240
 I mean, I'm certainly trying to live my life

1:08:07.240 --> 1:08:08.400
 like it has meaning.

1:08:08.400 --> 1:08:12.200
 You know, I really love my life now.

1:08:12.200 --> 1:08:14.680
 I just got back from Geneva.

1:08:14.680 --> 1:08:17.800
 I spent the summer abroad in Europe

1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:20.560
 and trying to be in a more civilized place

1:08:20.560 --> 1:08:25.280
 where you can enjoy yourself as a responsible adult.

1:08:25.280 --> 1:08:27.560
 And then it allowed me to decompress

1:08:27.560 --> 1:08:28.800
 and then come back here.

1:08:29.840 --> 1:08:31.200
 The thing about coming back here

1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:33.160
 is that you have to be ready to fight.

1:08:33.160 --> 1:08:35.520
 And I don't wanna fight anymore.

1:08:35.520 --> 1:08:39.680
 I just wanna be able to help a society and people.

1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:42.920
 And so I'll have to keep a place in Europe

1:08:42.920 --> 1:08:46.320
 to go and decompress and then come back

1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:48.120
 to be able to tolerate the situation.

1:08:48.120 --> 1:08:51.400
 So life for me has a lot of meaning.

1:08:51.400 --> 1:08:53.320
 I'm enjoying life.

1:08:53.320 --> 1:08:57.000
 And this is like the greatest,

1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:00.120
 the best part of my life ever right now at this moment.

1:09:00.120 --> 1:09:01.920
 So it's the joy,

1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:03.920
 but you also enjoy the fight a little bit or?

1:09:03.920 --> 1:09:06.040
 No, I don't really, I'm tired of that.

1:09:06.040 --> 1:09:08.480
 You know, it's like, why?

1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:11.480
 You're trying to,

1:09:11.480 --> 1:09:16.480
 I'm trying to help people to see how they can be happy

1:09:16.480 --> 1:09:19.320
 and then people are fighting me on that.

1:09:19.320 --> 1:09:20.200
 I don't wanna be happy.

1:09:20.200 --> 1:09:21.120
 I wanna be ignorant.

1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:22.280
 Leave me alone.

1:09:22.280 --> 1:09:24.120
 That's what people are saying.

1:09:24.120 --> 1:09:25.840
 Well, so what is the source of joy for you

1:09:25.840 --> 1:09:27.440
 when you decompress?

1:09:27.440 --> 1:09:30.440
 MDMA is a source, you know,

1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:34.880
 and a place where you don't have to worry about laws,

1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:35.880
 that's like Europe.

1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:37.560
 You can feel really free.

1:09:37.560 --> 1:09:41.960
 Yeah, heroin can even be a nice space

1:09:41.960 --> 1:09:44.320
 if I'm in my own head,

1:09:44.320 --> 1:09:46.640
 but with others, MDMA is great.

1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:51.960
 So, but good friends, good food.

1:09:52.840 --> 1:09:53.680
 The usual.

1:09:53.680 --> 1:09:55.120
 Yeah, yeah.

1:09:55.120 --> 1:09:56.160
 Family, love.

1:09:56.160 --> 1:09:57.800
 Yeah, that's right.

1:09:57.800 --> 1:09:59.560
 Carl, you're an incredible human being.

1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:00.680
 You really make me think.

1:10:00.680 --> 1:10:02.120
 Everyone who listens to this,

1:10:04.520 --> 1:10:07.320
 I mean, I'm really glad you exist.

1:10:07.320 --> 1:10:08.800
 I know you say you don't like the fight,

1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:10.400
 but I'm really glad you're fighting the fight

1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:11.920
 because it's gonna help a lot of people.

1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:15.160
 It's gonna help, at the very least,

1:10:15.160 --> 1:10:16.880
 help a lot of people think

1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:19.440
 and challenge the conventions of the day

1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:22.040
 and maybe challenge them to find joy.

1:10:22.040 --> 1:10:24.720
 I really appreciate you spending your valuable time with me.

1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:26.120
 This was an awesome conversation.

1:10:26.120 --> 1:10:27.200
 Thank you so much for talking to me.

1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:29.480
 Thank you for having me, man.

1:10:29.480 --> 1:10:32.840
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Carl Hart.

 And now let me leave you with some words from Frank Zappa.

1:10:40.280 --> 1:10:41.800
 A drug is not bad.

1:10:41.800 --> 1:10:44.160
 A drug is a chemical compound.

1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:47.400
 The problem comes in when people who take drugs

1:10:47.400 --> 1:10:50.160
 treat them like a license to behave like an asshole.

1:10:50.160 --> 1:11:11.160
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
