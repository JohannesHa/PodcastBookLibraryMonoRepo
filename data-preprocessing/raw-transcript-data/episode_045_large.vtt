00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
 The following is a conversation with Michio Kaku.

00:02.800 --> 00:05.120
 He's a theoretical physicist, futurist,

00:05.120 --> 00:08.360
 and professor at the City College of New York.

00:08.360 --> 00:10.760
 He's the author of many fascinating books

00:10.760 --> 00:12.840
 that explore the nature of our reality

00:12.840 --> 00:15.520
 and the future of our civilization.

00:15.520 --> 00:19.200
 They include Einstein's Cosmos, Physics of the Impossible,

00:19.200 --> 00:21.600
 Future of the Mind, Parallel Worlds,

00:21.600 --> 00:24.240
 and his latest, The Future of Humanity,

00:24.240 --> 00:26.640
 Terraforming Mars Interstellar Travel,

00:26.640 --> 00:29.960
 Immortality, and Our Destiny Beyond Earth.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.960
 I think it's beautiful and important

00:32.960 --> 00:35.760
 when a scientific mind can fearlessly explore

00:35.760 --> 00:37.600
 through conversation subjects

00:37.600 --> 00:40.200
 just outside of our understanding.

00:40.200 --> 00:43.440
 That, to me, is where artificial intelligence is today,

00:43.440 --> 00:45.680
 just outside of our understanding,

00:45.680 --> 00:47.440
 a place we have to reach for

00:47.440 --> 00:50.160
 if we're to uncover the mysteries of the human mind

00:50.160 --> 00:53.880
 and build human level and superhuman level AI systems

00:53.880 --> 00:56.640
 that transform our world for the better.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.240
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

00:59.240 --> 01:01.600

01:04.640 --> 01:06.600
 or simply connect with me on Twitter

01:06.600 --> 01:09.920
 at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

01:09.920 --> 01:13.700
 And now, here's my conversation with Michio Kaku.

01:14.680 --> 01:17.360
 You've mentioned that we just might make contact

01:17.360 --> 01:21.740
 with aliens or at least hear from them within this century.

01:21.740 --> 01:24.960
 Can you elaborate on your intuition behind that optimism?

01:25.880 --> 01:28.120
 Well, this is pure speculation, of course.

01:28.120 --> 01:28.960
 Of course.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.200
 Given the fact that we've already identified

01:31.200 --> 01:34.560
 4,000 exoplanets orbiting other stars,

01:34.560 --> 01:37.560
 and we have a census of the Milky Way galaxy

01:37.560 --> 01:39.160
 for the first time,

01:39.160 --> 01:43.560
 we know that on average, every single star, on average,

01:43.560 --> 01:45.640
 has a planet going around it,

01:45.640 --> 01:47.720
 and about one fifth or so of them

01:47.720 --> 01:51.240
 have Earth sized planets going around them.

01:51.240 --> 01:52.960
 So just do the math.

01:52.960 --> 01:56.160
 We're talking about out of 100 billion stars

01:56.160 --> 01:58.140
 in the Milky Way galaxy,

01:58.140 --> 01:59.820
 we're talking about billions

01:59.820 --> 02:02.880
 of potential Earth sized planets.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.760
 And to believe that we're the only one

02:05.760 --> 02:09.160
 is, I think, rather ridiculous, given the odds.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.600
 And how many galaxies are there?

02:11.600 --> 02:14.560
 Within sight of the Hubble Space Telescope,

02:14.560 --> 02:17.880
 there are about 100 billion galaxies.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.680
 So do the math.

02:19.680 --> 02:22.500
 How many stars are there in the visible universe?

02:22.500 --> 02:24.780
 100 billion galaxies,

02:24.780 --> 02:29.360
 times 100 billion stars per galaxy.

02:29.360 --> 02:33.720
 We're talking about a number beyond human imagination.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.480
 And to believe that we're the only ones,

02:35.480 --> 02:38.200
 I think, is rather ridiculous.

02:38.200 --> 02:42.180
 So you've talked about different types of,

02:42.180 --> 02:44.500
 type zero, one, two, three, four, and five,

02:44.500 --> 02:46.320
 even, of the Kardashev scale

02:47.200 --> 02:49.440
 of the different kind of civilizations.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.780
 What do you think it takes,

02:52.780 --> 02:54.640
 if it is indeed a ridiculous notion

02:54.640 --> 02:56.220
 that we're alone in the universe,

02:56.220 --> 02:58.720
 what do you think it takes to reach out?

02:58.720 --> 03:02.660
 First, to reach out through communication and connect.

03:02.660 --> 03:04.320
 Well, first of all, we have to understand

03:04.320 --> 03:08.720
 the level of sophistication of an alien life form

03:08.720 --> 03:10.520
 if we make contact with them.

03:10.520 --> 03:14.160
 I think in this century, we'll probably pick up signals,

03:14.160 --> 03:17.400
 signals from an extraterrestrial civilization.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.260
 We'll pick up there, I love Lucy,

03:19.260 --> 03:21.280
 and there, leave it to Beaver.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.500
 Just ordinary day to day transmissions

03:23.500 --> 03:25.600
 that they emit.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.200
 And the first thing we wanna do is to A,

03:28.200 --> 03:30.260
 decipher their language, of course,

03:30.260 --> 03:34.980
 but B, figure out at what level they are advanced

03:34.980 --> 03:37.080
 on the Kardashev scale.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.560
 I'm a physicist.

03:38.560 --> 03:43.560
 We rank things by two parameters, energy and information.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.600
 That's how we rank black holes.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.320
 That's how we rank stars.

03:47.320 --> 03:50.600
 That's how we rank civilizations in outer space.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.900
 So a type one civilization is capable

03:54.900 --> 03:57.540
 of harnessing planetary power.

03:57.540 --> 04:01.280
 They control the weather, for example, earthquakes, volcanoes.

04:01.280 --> 04:04.600
 They can modify the course of geological events,

04:04.600 --> 04:08.400
 sort of like Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers.

04:08.400 --> 04:11.120
 Type two would be stellar.

04:12.240 --> 04:15.620
 They play with stars, entire stars.

04:15.620 --> 04:18.440
 They use the entire energy output of a star,

04:18.440 --> 04:20.560
 sort of like Star Trek.

04:20.560 --> 04:24.640
 The Federation of Planets have colonized the nearby stars.

04:24.640 --> 04:29.080
 So a type two would be somewhat similar to Star Trek.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.660
 Type three would be galactic.

04:30.660 --> 04:33.840
 They roam the galactic space lanes.

04:33.840 --> 04:37.700
 And type three would be like Star Wars,

04:37.700 --> 04:39.880
 a galactic civilization.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.320
 Now, one day I was giving this talk in London

04:42.320 --> 04:45.580
 at the planetarium there, and the little boy comes up to me

04:45.580 --> 04:48.760
 and he says, professor, you're wrong.

04:48.760 --> 04:51.000
 You're wrong, there's type four.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.360
 And I told him, look, kid,

04:53.360 --> 04:57.000
 there are planets, stars, and galaxies.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.720
 That's it, folks.

04:58.720 --> 05:02.680
 And he kept persisting and saying, no, there's type four,

05:02.680 --> 05:05.800
 the power of the continuum.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.560
 And I thought about it for a moment.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.600
 And I said to myself,

05:08.600 --> 05:12.220
 is there an extra galactic source of energy,

05:12.220 --> 05:14.520
 the continuum of Star Trek?

05:14.520 --> 05:18.080
 And the answer is yes, there could be a type four.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.040
 And that's dark energy.

05:20.040 --> 05:25.040
 We now know that 73% of the energy of the universe

05:25.480 --> 05:27.560
 is dark energy.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.640
 Dark matter represents maybe 23% or so,

05:30.640 --> 05:33.040
 and we only represent 4%.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.640
 We're the oddballs.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.400
 And so you begin to realize that, yeah,

05:36.400 --> 05:39.760
 there could be type four, maybe even type five.

05:39.760 --> 05:43.280
 So type four, you're saying being able to harness

05:43.280 --> 05:45.360
 sort of like dark energy,

05:45.360 --> 05:47.120
 something that permeates the entire universe.

05:47.120 --> 05:51.000
 So be able to plug into the entire universe

05:51.000 --> 05:52.080
 as a source of energy.

05:52.080 --> 05:52.920
 That's right.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.680
 And dark energy is the energy of the Big Bang.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.920
 It's why the galaxies are being pushed apart.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.740
 It's the energy of nothing.

06:00.740 --> 06:02.560
 The more nothing you have,

06:02.560 --> 06:05.400
 the more dark energy that's repulsive.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.960
 And so the acceleration of the universe is accelerating

06:08.960 --> 06:12.560
 because the more you have, the more you can have.

06:12.560 --> 06:15.780
 And that, of course, is by definition an exponential curve.

06:15.780 --> 06:17.600
 It's called a de Sitter expansion,

06:17.600 --> 06:20.480
 and that's the current state of the universe.

06:20.480 --> 06:25.480
 And then type five, would that be able to seek

06:26.800 --> 06:31.040
 energy sources somehow outside of our universe?

06:31.040 --> 06:33.000
 And how crazy is that idea?

06:33.000 --> 06:35.400
 Yeah, type five will be the multiverse.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.280
 Multiverse, okay.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.760
 I'm a quantum physicist,

06:37.760 --> 06:40.280
 and we quantum physicists don't believe

06:40.280 --> 06:42.120
 that the Big Bang happened once.

06:42.120 --> 06:45.120
 That would violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.880
 And that means that there could be multiple bangs

06:47.880 --> 06:49.360
 happening all the time.

06:49.360 --> 06:52.120
 Even as we speak today,

06:52.120 --> 06:56.180
 universes are being created, and that fits the data.

06:56.180 --> 06:59.960
 The inflationary universe is a quantum theory.

06:59.960 --> 07:02.060
 So there's a certain finite probability

07:02.060 --> 07:05.120
 that universes are being created all the time.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.740
 And for me, this is actually rather aesthetically pleasing

07:08.740 --> 07:13.200
 because I was raised as a Presbyterian,

07:13.200 --> 07:15.920
 but my parents were Buddhists.

07:15.920 --> 07:19.520
 And there's two diametrically opposed ideas

07:19.520 --> 07:21.080
 about the universe.

07:21.080 --> 07:23.240
 In Buddhism, there's only nirvana.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.160
 There's no beginning, there's no end,

07:25.160 --> 07:26.940
 there's only timelessness.

07:26.940 --> 07:29.960
 But in Christianity, there is the instant

07:29.960 --> 07:32.760
 when God said, let there be light.

07:32.760 --> 07:35.320
 In other words, an instant of creation.

07:35.320 --> 07:40.160
 So I've had these two mutually exclusive ideas in my head,

07:40.160 --> 07:42.760
 and I now realize that it's possible to meld them

07:42.760 --> 07:44.060
 into a single theory.

07:45.120 --> 07:48.640
 Either the universe had a beginning or it didn't, right?

07:48.640 --> 07:49.880
 Wrong.

07:49.880 --> 07:53.160
 You see, our universe had a beginning.

07:53.160 --> 07:56.240
 Our universe had an instant where somebody might have said,

07:56.240 --> 07:57.860
 let there be light.

07:57.860 --> 08:00.340
 But there are other bubble universes out there

08:00.340 --> 08:02.720
 in a bubble bath of universes.

08:02.720 --> 08:07.280
 And that means that these universes are expanding

08:07.280 --> 08:11.240
 into a dimension beyond our three dimensional comprehension.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.080
 In other words, hyperspace.

08:13.080 --> 08:16.360
 In other words, 11 dimensional hyperspace.

08:16.360 --> 08:21.360
 So nirvana would be this timeless 11 dimensional hyperspace

08:21.680 --> 08:24.860
 where big bangs are happening all the time.

08:24.860 --> 08:28.640
 So we can now combine two mutually exclusive theories

08:28.640 --> 08:29.660
 of creation.

08:30.920 --> 08:35.320
 And Stephen Hawking, for example, even in his last book,

08:35.320 --> 08:37.120
 even said that this is an argument

08:37.120 --> 08:39.320
 against the existence of God.

08:39.320 --> 08:42.680
 He said there is no God because there was not enough time

08:42.680 --> 08:44.320
 for God to create the universe

08:44.320 --> 08:47.800
 because the big bang happened in an instant of time.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.400
 Therefore, there was no time available

08:50.400 --> 08:52.360
 for him to create the universe.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.600
 But you see, the multiverse idea

08:54.600 --> 08:58.040
 means that there was a time before time.

08:58.040 --> 09:01.920
 And there are multiple times, each bubble has its own time.

09:01.920 --> 09:06.240
 And so it means that there could actually be a universe

09:06.240 --> 09:09.640
 before the beginning of our universe.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.620
 So if you think of a bubble bath, when two bubbles collide,

09:13.640 --> 09:16.800
 or when two bubbles fission to create a baby bubble,

09:16.800 --> 09:18.800
 that's called the big bang.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.520
 So the big bang is nothing but the collision of universes

09:21.520 --> 09:23.720
 or the budding of universes.

09:23.720 --> 09:25.080
 That's such a beautiful picture

09:25.080 --> 09:28.000
 of our incredibly mysterious existence.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.240
 So is that humbling to you?

09:30.240 --> 09:32.840
 Exciting, the idea of multiverses?

09:32.840 --> 09:35.000
 I don't even know how to even begin

09:35.000 --> 09:37.640
 to wrap my mind around it.

09:37.640 --> 09:38.480
 It's exciting for me

09:38.480 --> 09:41.680
 because what I do for a living is string theory.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.040
 That's my day job.

09:43.040 --> 09:46.840
 I get paid by the city of New York to work on string theory.

09:46.840 --> 09:50.520
 And you see, string theory is a multiverse theory.

09:50.520 --> 09:53.400
 So people say, first of all, what is string theory?

09:53.400 --> 09:55.640
 String theory simply says that all the particles

09:55.640 --> 09:58.240
 we see in nature, the electron, the proton,

09:58.240 --> 09:59.840
 the quarks, what have you,

09:59.840 --> 10:03.240
 are nothing but vibrations on a musical string,

10:03.240 --> 10:04.960
 on a tiny, tiny little string.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.400
 You know, G. Robert Oppenheimer,

10:07.400 --> 10:09.640
 the creator of the atomic bomb,

10:09.640 --> 10:12.040
 was so frustrated in the 1950s

10:12.040 --> 10:15.160
 with all these subatomic particles being created

10:15.160 --> 10:18.240
 in our atom smashers that he announced,

10:18.240 --> 10:22.680
 he announced one day that the Nobel Prize in physics

10:22.680 --> 10:23.960
 should go to the physicist

10:23.960 --> 10:28.280
 who does not discover a new particle that year.

10:28.280 --> 10:30.600
 Well, today we think they're nothing but musical notes

10:30.600 --> 10:32.960
 on these tiny little vibrating strings.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.720
 So what is physics?

10:34.720 --> 10:38.600
 Physics is the harmonies you can write on vibrating strings.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.160
 What is chemistry?

10:40.160 --> 10:44.840
 Chemistry is the melodies you can play on these strings.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.160
 What is the universe?

10:47.040 --> 10:50.280
 The universe is a symphony of strings.

10:50.280 --> 10:53.200
 And then what is the mind of God

10:53.200 --> 10:55.720
 that Albert Einstein so eloquently wrote about

10:55.720 --> 10:58.400
 for the last 30 years of his life?

10:58.400 --> 11:02.760
 The mind of God would be cosmic music,

11:02.760 --> 11:06.160
 resonating through 11 dimensional hyperspace.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.280
 So beautifully put.

11:07.280 --> 11:11.880
 What do you think is the mind of Einstein's God?

11:11.880 --> 11:16.160
 Do you think there's a why that we could untangle

11:16.160 --> 11:19.760
 from this universe of strings?

11:19.760 --> 11:20.920
 Why are we here?

11:20.920 --> 11:22.400
 What is the meaning of it all?

11:23.320 --> 11:26.280
 Well, Steven Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize,

11:26.280 --> 11:29.760
 once said that the more we learn about the universe,

11:29.760 --> 11:32.240
 the more we learn that it's pointless.

11:32.240 --> 11:35.600
 Well, I don't know.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.280
 I don't profess to understand

11:37.280 --> 11:39.320
 the great secrets of the universe.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.120
 However, let me say two things

11:41.120 --> 11:43.320
 about what the giants of physics

11:43.320 --> 11:45.320
 have said about this question.

11:45.320 --> 11:48.440
 Einstein believed in two types of God.

11:49.320 --> 11:54.280
 One was the God of the Bible, the personal God,

11:54.280 --> 11:56.560
 the God that answers prayers, walks on waters,

11:56.560 --> 12:00.040
 performs miracles, smites the Philistines.

12:00.040 --> 12:02.640
 That's the personal God that he didn't believe in.

12:02.640 --> 12:05.480
 He believed in the God of Spinoza,

12:05.480 --> 12:10.040
 the God of order, simplicity, harmony, beauty.

12:10.040 --> 12:12.840
 The universe could have been ugly.

12:12.840 --> 12:15.680
 The universe could have been messy, random,

12:15.680 --> 12:17.360
 but it's gorgeous.

12:17.360 --> 12:19.960
 You realize that on a single sheet of paper,

12:19.960 --> 12:23.120
 we can write down all the known laws of the universe.

12:23.120 --> 12:25.400
 It's amazing, on one sheet of paper,

12:25.400 --> 12:27.840
 Einstein's equation is one inch long,

12:27.840 --> 12:30.040
 string theory is a lot longer,

12:30.040 --> 12:31.960
 and so it's a standard model,

12:31.960 --> 12:33.880
 but you could put all these equations

12:33.880 --> 12:36.000
 on one sheet of paper.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.640
 It didn't have to be that way.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.240
 It could have been messy.

12:40.240 --> 12:43.160
 And so, Einstein thought of himself as a young boy

12:43.160 --> 12:47.480
 entering this huge library for the first time,

12:47.480 --> 12:51.160
 being overwhelmed by the simplicity, elegance,

12:51.160 --> 12:53.160
 and beauty of this library,

12:53.160 --> 12:56.560
 but all he could do was read the first page

12:56.560 --> 12:58.320
 of the first volume.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.320
 Well, that library is the universe,

13:00.320 --> 13:03.240
 with all sorts of mysterious, magical things

13:03.240 --> 13:05.280
 that we have yet to find.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.920
 And then Galileo was asked about this.

13:07.920 --> 13:12.920
 Galileo said that the purpose of science,

13:13.000 --> 13:17.680
 the purpose of science is to determine how the heavens go.

13:17.680 --> 13:20.680
 The purpose of religion is to determine

13:20.680 --> 13:22.400
 how to go to heaven.

13:22.400 --> 13:26.200
 So in other words, science is about natural law,

13:26.200 --> 13:29.480
 and religion is about ethics,

13:29.480 --> 13:32.320
 how to be a good person, how to go to heaven.

13:32.320 --> 13:35.000
 As long as we keep these two things apart,

13:35.000 --> 13:36.960
 we're in great shape.

13:36.960 --> 13:41.080
 The problem occurs when people from the natural sciences

13:41.080 --> 13:43.360
 begin to pontificate about ethics,

13:43.360 --> 13:46.200
 and people from religion begin to pontificate

13:46.200 --> 13:47.880
 about natural law.

13:47.880 --> 13:50.800
 That's where we get into big trouble.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.720
 You think they're fundamentally distinct,

13:53.720 --> 13:58.360
 morality and ethics and our idea of what is right

13:58.360 --> 13:59.360
 and what is wrong.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.080
 That's something that's outside the reach

14:02.080 --> 14:03.960
 of string theory and physics.

14:03.960 --> 14:04.800
 That's right.

14:04.800 --> 14:08.680
 If you talk to a squirrel about what is right

14:08.680 --> 14:12.520
 and what is wrong, there's no reference frame

14:12.520 --> 14:16.600
 for a squirrel, and realize that aliens from outer space,

14:16.600 --> 14:20.560
 if they ever come visit us, they'll try to talk to us

14:20.560 --> 14:22.520
 like we talk to squirrels in the forest,

14:22.520 --> 14:25.880
 but eventually we get bored talking to the squirrels

14:25.880 --> 14:28.040
 because they don't talk back to us.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.000
 Same thing with aliens from outer space.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.280
 They come down to earth, they'll be curious about us

14:32.280 --> 14:35.440
 to a degree, but after a while they just get bored

14:35.440 --> 14:37.920
 because we have nothing to offer them.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.480
 So our sense of right and wrong,

14:40.480 --> 14:43.400
 what does that mean compared to a squirrel's sense

14:43.400 --> 14:45.680
 of right and wrong?

14:46.560 --> 14:48.720
 Now we of course do have an ethics

14:48.720 --> 14:51.840
 that keeps civilizations in line,

14:51.840 --> 14:56.480
 enriches our life and makes civilization possible.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.040
 And I think that's a good thing,

14:58.040 --> 15:01.560
 but it's not mandated by a law of physics.

15:01.560 --> 15:06.560
 So if aliens do, alien species were to make contact,

15:06.960 --> 15:10.040
 forgive me for staying on aliens for a bit longer.

15:10.920 --> 15:15.640
 Do you think they're more likely to be friendly,

15:15.640 --> 15:18.680
 to befriend us or to destroy us?

15:18.680 --> 15:20.560
 Well, I think for the most part,

15:20.560 --> 15:22.880
 they'll pretty much ignore us.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.920
 If you're a deer in the forest, who do you fear the most?

15:25.920 --> 15:30.480
 Do you fear the hunter with his gigantic 16 gauge shotgun?

15:30.480 --> 15:35.400
 Or do you fear the guy with a briefcase and glasses?

15:35.400 --> 15:39.040
 Well, the guy with the briefcase could be a developer

15:39.040 --> 15:42.400
 about to basically flatten the entire forest,

15:42.400 --> 15:44.200
 destroying your livelihood.

15:44.200 --> 15:47.720
 So instinctively you may be afraid of the hunter,

15:47.720 --> 15:51.320
 but actually the problem with deers in the forest

15:51.320 --> 15:54.160
 is that they should fear developers

15:54.160 --> 15:57.360
 because developers look at deer as simply

15:57.360 --> 15:59.440
 getting in the way.

15:59.440 --> 16:02.560
 I mean, in War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells,

16:02.560 --> 16:04.760
 the aliens did not hate us.

16:04.760 --> 16:05.960
 If you read the book,

16:05.960 --> 16:10.960
 the aliens did not have evil intentions toward homo sapiens.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.560
 No, we were in the way.

16:13.560 --> 16:18.000
 So I think we have to realize that alien civilizations

16:18.000 --> 16:21.080
 may view us quite differently than in science fiction novels.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.800
 However, I personally believe,

16:22.800 --> 16:24.560
 and I cannot prove any of this,

16:24.560 --> 16:27.320
 I personally believe that they're probably gonna be peaceful

16:27.320 --> 16:31.720
 because there's nothing that they want from our world.

16:31.720 --> 16:33.360
 I mean, what are they gonna take us?

16:33.360 --> 16:35.360
 What are they gonna take us for, gold?

16:35.360 --> 16:39.360
 No, gold is a useless metal for the most part.

16:39.360 --> 16:43.600
 It's silver, I mean, it's gold in color,

16:43.600 --> 16:45.640
 but that only affects homo sapiens.

16:45.640 --> 16:47.760
 Squirrels don't care about gold.

16:47.760 --> 16:50.560
 And so gold is a rather useless element.

16:50.560 --> 16:53.160
 Rare earths maybe, platinum based elements,

16:53.160 --> 16:55.720
 rare earths for the electronics, yeah, maybe.

16:55.720 --> 16:59.280
 But other than that, we have nothing to offer them.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.640
 I mean, think about it for a moment.

17:01.640 --> 17:06.560
 People love Shakespeare and they love the arts and poetry,

17:06.560 --> 17:10.200
 but outside of the earth, they mean nothing,

17:10.200 --> 17:12.320
 absolutely nothing.

17:12.320 --> 17:15.800
 I mean, when I write down an equation in string theory,

17:15.800 --> 17:19.760
 I would hope that on the other side of the galaxy,

17:19.760 --> 17:22.880
 there's an alien writing down that very same equation

17:22.880 --> 17:24.720
 in different notation,

17:24.720 --> 17:27.240
 but that alien on the other side of the galaxy,

17:27.240 --> 17:30.360
 Shakespeare, poetry, Hemingway,

17:30.360 --> 17:33.960
 it would mean nothing to him or her or it.

17:33.960 --> 17:38.080
 When you think about entities that's out there,

17:38.080 --> 17:43.080
 extraterrestrial, do you think they would naturally look

17:43.880 --> 17:48.000
 something that even is recognizable to us as life?

17:48.000 --> 17:50.560
 Or would they be radically different?

17:50.560 --> 17:52.840
 Well, how did we become intelligent?

17:52.840 --> 17:56.160
 Basically three things made us intelligent.

17:56.160 --> 17:59.320
 One is our eyesight, stereo eyesight.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.160
 We have the eyes of a hunter,

18:01.160 --> 18:04.240
 stereo vision so we lock in on targets.

18:04.240 --> 18:09.240
 And who is smarter, predator or prey?

18:09.360 --> 18:11.560
 Predators are smarter than prey.

18:11.560 --> 18:13.240
 They have their eyes at the front of their face,

18:13.240 --> 18:14.800
 like lions, tigers,

18:15.680 --> 18:18.800
 while rabbits have eyes to the side of their face.

18:18.800 --> 18:19.840
 Why is that?

18:19.840 --> 18:22.720
 Hunters have to zero in on the target.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.560
 They have to know how to ambush.

18:24.560 --> 18:27.000
 They have to know how to hide, camouflage,

18:27.000 --> 18:30.160
 sneak up, stealth, deceit.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.960
 That takes a lot of intelligence.

18:31.960 --> 18:35.200
 Rabbits, all they have to do is run.

18:35.200 --> 18:39.880
 So that's the first criterion, stereo eyesight of some sort.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.760
 Second is the thumb.

18:42.760 --> 18:44.640
 The opposable thumb of some sort

18:44.640 --> 18:46.120
 could be a claw or a tentacle.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.640
 So hand eye coordination.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.240
 Hand eye coordination is the way

18:50.240 --> 18:52.800
 we manipulate the environment.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.040
 And then three, language.

18:55.040 --> 18:58.200
 Because mama bear never tells baby bear

18:58.200 --> 19:00.360
 to avoid the human hunter.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.360
 Bears just learn by themselves.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.040
 They never hand out information

19:04.040 --> 19:06.240
 from one generation to the next.

19:06.240 --> 19:09.160
 So these are the three basic ingredients of intelligence.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.960
 Eyesight of some sort, an opposable thumb

19:12.960 --> 19:16.640
 or tentacle or claw of some sort, and language.

19:16.640 --> 19:19.080
 Now ask yourself a simple question.

19:19.080 --> 19:22.400
 How many animals have all three?

19:22.400 --> 19:23.480
 Just us.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.200
 It's just us.

19:25.200 --> 19:28.440
 I mean, the primates, they have a language, yeah,

19:28.440 --> 19:30.720
 they may get up to maybe 20 words,

19:30.720 --> 19:32.720
 but a baby learns a word a day,

19:32.720 --> 19:35.120
 several words a day a baby learns.

19:35.120 --> 19:40.120
 And a typical adult knows about almost 5,000 words.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.800
 While the maximum number of words

19:42.800 --> 19:46.600
 that you can teach a gorilla in any language,

19:46.600 --> 19:49.680
 including their own language, is about 20 or so.

19:49.680 --> 19:53.080
 And so we see the difference in intelligence.

19:53.080 --> 19:55.560
 So when we meet aliens from outer space,

19:55.560 --> 19:58.040
 chances are they will have been descended

19:58.040 --> 20:01.040
 from predators of some sort.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.440
 They'll have some way to manipulate the environment

20:03.440 --> 20:07.000
 and communicate their knowledge to the next generation.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.000
 That's it, folks.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.400
 So functionally, that would be similar.

20:12.400 --> 20:15.880
 That would, we would be able to recognize them.

20:15.880 --> 20:17.920
 Well, not necessarily, because I think

20:17.920 --> 20:20.960
 even with Homo sapiens, we are eventually

20:20.960 --> 20:24.760
 going to perhaps become part cybernetic

20:24.760 --> 20:26.640
 and genetically enhanced.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.520
 Already, robots are getting smarter and smarter.

20:31.520 --> 20:35.720
 Right now, robots have the intelligence of a cockroach.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.280
 But in the coming years,

20:37.280 --> 20:40.480
 our robots will be as smart as a mouse,

20:40.480 --> 20:42.840
 then maybe as smart as a rabbit.

20:42.840 --> 20:47.200
 If we're lucky, maybe as smart as a cat or a dog.

20:47.200 --> 20:50.200
 And by the end of the century, who knows for sure,

20:50.200 --> 20:53.680
 our robots will be probably as smart as a monkey.

20:53.680 --> 20:56.960
 Now, at that point, of course, they could be dangerous.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.720
 You see, monkeys are self aware.

20:59.720 --> 21:03.320
 They know they are monkeys.

21:03.320 --> 21:06.160
 They may have a different agenda than us.

21:06.160 --> 21:09.560
 While dogs, dogs are confused.

21:10.600 --> 21:14.760
 You see, dogs think that we are a dog,

21:14.760 --> 21:16.360
 that we're the top dog.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.480
 They're the underdog.

21:17.480 --> 21:20.200
 That's why they whimper and follow us and lick us

21:20.200 --> 21:21.320
 all the time.

21:21.320 --> 21:22.920
 We're the top dog.

21:22.920 --> 21:25.440
 Monkeys have no illusion at all.

21:25.440 --> 21:28.280
 They know we are not monkeys.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.960
 And so I think that in the future,

21:29.960 --> 21:32.960
 we'll have to put a chip in their brain to shut them off

21:32.960 --> 21:35.480
 once our robots have murderous thoughts.

21:35.480 --> 21:37.480
 But that's in a hundred years.

21:37.480 --> 21:41.520
 In 200 years, the robots will be smart enough

21:41.520 --> 21:44.640
 to remove that fail safe chip in their brain

21:44.640 --> 21:46.840
 and then watch out.

21:46.840 --> 21:51.840
 At that point, I think rather than compete with our robots,

21:52.600 --> 21:53.840
 we should merge with them.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.800
 We should become part cybernetic.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.480
 So I think when we meet alien life from outer space,

21:59.480 --> 22:04.480
 they may be genetically and cybernetically enhanced.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.720
 Genetically and cybernetically enhanced.

22:07.720 --> 22:11.040
 Wow, so let's talk about that full range.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.720
 In the near term and 200 years from now,

22:13.720 --> 22:16.920
 how promising in the near term in your view

22:16.920 --> 22:18.760
 is brain machine interfaces?

22:18.760 --> 22:22.920
 So starting to allow computers to talk directly

22:22.920 --> 22:26.880
 to the brains, Elon Musk is working on that with Neuralink

22:26.880 --> 22:29.000
 and there's other companies working on this idea.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.480
 Do you see promise there?

22:30.480 --> 22:32.960
 Do you see hope for near term impact?

22:32.960 --> 22:36.400
 Well, every technology has pluses and minuses.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.600
 Already we can record memories.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.920
 I have a book, The Future of the Mind,

22:40.920 --> 22:42.840
 where I detail some of these breakthroughs.

22:42.840 --> 22:46.360
 We can now record simple memories of mice

22:46.360 --> 22:49.320
 and send these memories on the internet.

22:49.320 --> 22:52.080
 Eventually, we're gonna do this with primates

22:52.080 --> 22:55.960
 at Wake Forest University and also in Los Angeles.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.720
 And then after that,

22:57.720 --> 23:00.880
 we'll have a memory chip for Alzheimer's patients.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.840
 We'll test it out in Alzheimer's patients

23:02.840 --> 23:05.800
 because of course, when Alzheimer's patients

23:05.800 --> 23:07.760
 lose their memory, they wander.

23:07.760 --> 23:11.680
 They create all sorts of havoc, wandering around,

23:11.680 --> 23:15.640
 oblivious to their surroundings and they'll have a chip.

23:15.640 --> 23:18.240
 They'll push the button and memories,

23:18.240 --> 23:21.120
 memories will come flooding into their hippocampus

23:21.120 --> 23:26.120
 and the chip telling them where they live and who they are.

23:26.280 --> 23:29.520
 And so a memory chip is definitely in the cards.

23:29.520 --> 23:33.200
 And I think this will eventually affect human civilization.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.080
 What is the future of the internet?

23:35.080 --> 23:37.680
 The future of the internet is brain net.

23:37.680 --> 23:41.680
 Brain net is when we send emotions, feelings,

23:41.680 --> 23:44.400
 sensations on the internet.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.640
 And we will telepathically communicate

23:46.640 --> 23:49.600
 with other humans this way.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.160
 This is gonna affect everything.

23:51.160 --> 23:52.480
 Look at entertainment.

23:52.480 --> 23:54.080
 Remember the silent movies?

23:54.080 --> 23:56.240
 Charlie Chaplin was very famous

23:56.240 --> 23:58.040
 during the era of silent movies.

23:58.040 --> 23:59.960
 But when the talkies came in,

23:59.960 --> 24:03.000
 nobody wanted to see Charlie Chaplin anymore

24:03.000 --> 24:05.640
 because he never talked in the movies.

24:05.640 --> 24:08.880
 And so a whole generation of actors lost their job

24:08.880 --> 24:11.400
 and a new series of actors came in.

24:11.400 --> 24:16.400
 Next, we're gonna have the movies replaced by brain net

24:16.960 --> 24:19.480
 because in the future, people will say,

24:19.480 --> 24:23.120
 who wants to see a screen with images?

24:23.120 --> 24:23.960
 That's it.

24:23.960 --> 24:27.320
 Sound and image, that's called the movies.

24:27.320 --> 24:28.960
 In our entertainment industry,

24:28.960 --> 24:32.240
 this multi billion dollar industry is based on screens

24:32.240 --> 24:34.680
 with moving images and sound.

24:34.680 --> 24:39.680
 But what happens when emotions, feelings, sensations,

24:39.920 --> 24:43.200
 memories can be conveyed on the internet?

24:43.200 --> 24:44.800
 It's gonna change everything.

24:44.800 --> 24:46.280
 Human relations will change

24:46.280 --> 24:47.720
 because you'll be able to empathize

24:47.720 --> 24:50.280
 and feel the suffering of other people.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.280
 We'll be able to communicate telepathically.

24:53.280 --> 24:55.880
 And this is coming.

24:55.880 --> 24:58.640
 You described brain net and future of the mind.

24:58.640 --> 25:00.960
 This is an interesting concept.

25:00.960 --> 25:03.920
 Do you think, so you mentioned entertainment,

25:03.920 --> 25:06.200
 but what kind of effect would it have

25:06.200 --> 25:08.600
 on our personal relationships?

25:08.600 --> 25:10.360
 Hopefully it will deepen it.

25:10.360 --> 25:13.360
 You realize that for most of human history,

25:13.360 --> 25:16.760
 for over 90% of human history,

25:16.760 --> 25:21.760
 we only knew maybe 20, 100 people.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.520
 That's it, folks.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.000
 That was your tribe.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.400
 That was everybody you knew in the universe

25:28.400 --> 25:31.720
 was only maybe 50 or 100.

25:31.720 --> 25:33.240
 With the coming of towns,

25:33.240 --> 25:35.640
 of course it expanded to a few thousand.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.480
 With the coming of the telephone,

25:37.480 --> 25:40.520
 all of a sudden you could reach thousands of people

25:40.520 --> 25:41.600
 with a telephone.

25:41.600 --> 25:42.680
 And now with the internet,

25:42.680 --> 25:45.520
 you can reach the entire population of the planet Earth.

25:45.520 --> 25:48.400
 And so I think this is a normal progression.

25:48.400 --> 25:52.320
 And you think that kind of sort of connection

25:52.320 --> 25:53.920
 to the rest of the world,

25:53.920 --> 25:55.360
 and then adding sensations

25:55.360 --> 25:58.880
 like being able to share telepathically emotions and so on

25:58.880 --> 26:01.160
 that would just further deepen our connection

26:01.160 --> 26:02.920
 to our fellow humans.

26:02.920 --> 26:03.760
 That's right.

26:03.760 --> 26:07.680
 In fact, I disagree with many scientists on this question.

26:07.680 --> 26:11.200
 Most scientists would say that technology is neutral.

26:11.200 --> 26:12.600
 A double edged sword,

26:12.600 --> 26:15.960
 one side of the sword can cut against people.

26:15.960 --> 26:17.360
 The other side of the sword

26:17.360 --> 26:20.840
 can cut against ignorance and disease.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.440
 I disagree.

26:22.440 --> 26:25.920
 I think technology does have a moral direction.

26:25.920 --> 26:27.360
 Look at the internet.

26:27.360 --> 26:30.680
 The internet spreads knowledge, awareness,

26:30.680 --> 26:33.040
 and that creates empowerment.

26:33.040 --> 26:35.400
 People act on knowledge.

26:35.400 --> 26:36.760
 When they begin to realize

26:36.760 --> 26:38.520
 that they don't have to live that way,

26:38.520 --> 26:41.080
 they don't have to suffer under a dictatorship,

26:41.080 --> 26:44.560
 that there are other ways of living under freedom,

26:44.560 --> 26:47.720
 then they begin to take things, take power.

26:47.720 --> 26:49.600
 And that spreads democracy.

26:49.600 --> 26:54.240
 And democracies do not war with other democracies.

26:54.240 --> 26:55.240
 I'm a scientist.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.160
 I believe in data.

26:57.160 --> 26:59.080
 So let's take a sheet of paper

26:59.080 --> 27:03.760
 and write down every single war you had to learn

27:03.760 --> 27:05.880
 since you were in elementary school.

27:05.880 --> 27:07.800
 Every single war, hundreds of them.

27:07.800 --> 27:11.040
 Kings, queens, emperors, dictators.

27:11.040 --> 27:13.600
 All these wars were between kings, queens,

27:13.600 --> 27:15.240
 emperors, and dictators.

27:15.240 --> 27:19.840
 Never between two major democracies.

27:19.840 --> 27:22.560
 And so I think with the spread of this technology

27:22.560 --> 27:26.120
 and which would accelerate with the coming of brain net,

27:26.120 --> 27:28.480
 it means that, well, we will still have wars.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.520
 Wars, of course, is politics by other means,

27:31.520 --> 27:34.440
 but they'll be less intense and less frequent.

27:35.440 --> 27:40.440
 Do you have worries of longer term existential risk

27:40.960 --> 27:43.440
 from technology, from AI?

27:43.440 --> 27:48.120
 So I think that's a wonderful vision of a future

27:48.120 --> 27:51.200
 where war is a distant memory,

27:51.200 --> 27:53.840
 but now there's another agent.

27:53.840 --> 27:57.920
 There's somebody else that's able to create conflict,

27:57.920 --> 28:00.920
 that's able to create harm, AI systems.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.080
 So do you have worry about such AI systems?

28:03.080 --> 28:05.440
 Well, yes, that is an existential risk,

28:05.440 --> 28:07.760
 but again, I think an existential risk,

28:07.760 --> 28:09.800
 not for this century.

28:09.800 --> 28:12.520
 I think our grandkids are gonna have to confront

28:12.520 --> 28:15.160
 this question as robots gradually approach

28:15.160 --> 28:17.840
 the intelligence of a dog, a cat,

28:17.840 --> 28:20.440
 and finally that of a monkey.

28:20.440 --> 28:23.760
 However, I think we will digitize ourselves as well.

28:23.760 --> 28:26.160
 Not only are we gonna merge with our technology,

28:26.160 --> 28:28.560
 we'll also digitize our personality,

28:28.560 --> 28:30.680
 our memories, our feelings.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.560
 You realize during the Middle Ages,

28:32.560 --> 28:34.680
 there was something called dualism.

28:34.680 --> 28:38.200
 Dualism meant that the soul was separate from the body.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.920
 When the body died, the soul went to heaven.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.440
 That's dualism.

28:42.440 --> 28:45.440
 Then in the 20th century, neuroscience came in

28:45.440 --> 28:47.720
 and said, bah, humbug.

28:47.720 --> 28:50.920
 Every time we look at the brain, it's just neurons.

28:50.920 --> 28:54.640
 That's it, folks, period, end of story.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.840
 Bunch of neurons firing.

28:56.840 --> 28:59.640
 Now we're going back to dualism.

28:59.640 --> 29:03.440
 Now we realize that we can digitize human memories,

29:03.440 --> 29:08.440
 feelings, sensations, and create a digital copy of ourselves,

29:09.040 --> 29:11.600
 and that's called the Connectome Project.

29:11.600 --> 29:14.320
 Billions of dollars are now being spent

29:14.320 --> 29:17.320
 to do not just the genome project

29:17.320 --> 29:19.680
 of sequencing the genes of our body,

29:19.680 --> 29:21.640
 but the Connectome Project,

29:21.640 --> 29:26.120
 which is to map the entire connections of the human brain.

29:26.120 --> 29:28.920
 And even before then, already in Silicon Valley,

29:28.920 --> 29:31.320
 today, at this very moment,

29:31.320 --> 29:33.480
 you can contact Silicon Valley companies

29:33.480 --> 29:36.800
 that are willing to digitize your relatives

29:36.800 --> 29:39.760
 because some people want to talk to their parents.

29:39.760 --> 29:42.400
 There are unresolved issues with their parents,

29:42.400 --> 29:45.800
 and one day, yes, firms will digitize people,

29:45.800 --> 29:49.280
 and you'll be able to talk to them a reasonable facsimile.

29:49.280 --> 29:52.440
 We leave a digital trail.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.080
 Our ancestors did not.

29:54.080 --> 29:57.600
 Our ancestors were lucky if they had one line,

29:57.600 --> 30:00.720
 just one line in a church book,

30:00.720 --> 30:04.400
 saying the date they were baptized and the date they died.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.280
 That's it.

30:05.280 --> 30:08.200
 That was their entire digital memory.

30:08.200 --> 30:11.520
 I mean, their entire digital existence summarized

30:11.520 --> 30:15.960
 in just a few letters of the alphabet, a whole life.

30:15.960 --> 30:17.960
 Now we digitize everything.

30:17.960 --> 30:20.320
 Every time you sneeze, you digitize it.

30:20.320 --> 30:21.720
 You put it on the internet.

30:22.800 --> 30:25.440
 And so I think that we are gonna digitize ourselves

30:25.440 --> 30:28.000
 and give us digital immortality.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.280
 We'll not only have biologic genetic immortality

30:31.280 --> 30:34.880
 of some sort, but also digital immortality.

30:34.880 --> 30:37.080
 And what are we gonna do with it?

30:37.080 --> 30:39.800
 I think we should send it into outer space.

30:40.880 --> 30:43.080
 If you digitize the human brain

30:43.080 --> 30:46.600
 and put it on a laser beam and shoot it to the moon,

30:46.600 --> 30:48.840
 you're on the moon in one second.

30:48.840 --> 30:51.960
 Shoot it to Mars, you're on Mars in 20 minutes.

30:51.960 --> 30:54.800
 Shoot it to Pluto, you're on Pluto in eight hours.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.160
 Think about it for a moment.

30:56.160 --> 30:58.480
 You can have breakfast in New York

30:58.480 --> 31:02.000
 and for a morning snack, vacation on the moon,

31:02.000 --> 31:05.560
 then zap your way to Mars by noontime,

31:05.560 --> 31:08.520
 journey through the asteroid belt of the afternoon,

31:08.520 --> 31:11.960
 and then come back for dinner in New York at night.

31:11.960 --> 31:16.120
 All in a day's work at the speed of light.

31:16.120 --> 31:19.680
 Now, this means that you don't need booster rockets.

31:19.680 --> 31:21.720
 You don't need weightlessness problems.

31:21.720 --> 31:23.760
 You don't need to worry about meteorites.

31:23.760 --> 31:25.320
 And what's on the moon?

31:25.320 --> 31:27.360
 On the moon, there is a mainframe

31:27.360 --> 31:30.200
 that downloads your laser beam's information.

31:31.080 --> 31:34.000
 And where does it download the information into?

31:34.000 --> 31:35.760
 An avatar.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.800
 Now, what does that avatar look like?

31:37.800 --> 31:40.960
 Anything you want.

31:40.960 --> 31:41.920
 Think about it for a moment.

31:41.920 --> 31:46.920
 You could be Superman, Superwoman, on the moon, on Mars,

31:47.400 --> 31:50.840
 traveling throughout the universe at the speed of light,

31:50.840 --> 31:55.240
 downloading your personality into any vehicle you want.

31:55.240 --> 31:57.200
 Now, let me stick my neck out.

31:57.200 --> 31:58.960
 So far, everything I've been saying

31:58.960 --> 32:00.800
 is well within the laws of physics.

32:00.800 --> 32:02.480
 Well within the laws of physics.

32:02.480 --> 32:04.760
 Now, let me go outside the laws of physics again.

32:04.760 --> 32:05.920
 Here we go.

32:05.920 --> 32:08.840
 I think this already exists.

32:08.840 --> 32:11.880
 I think outside the Earth, there could be a super highway

32:11.880 --> 32:14.760
 a laser highway of laser porting

32:14.760 --> 32:17.560
 with billions of souls of aliens

32:17.560 --> 32:20.880
 zapping their way across the galaxy.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.680
 Now, let me ask you a question.

32:22.680 --> 32:25.280
 Are we smart enough to determine

32:25.280 --> 32:28.280
 whether such a thing exists or not?

32:28.280 --> 32:31.200
 No, this could exist right outside

32:31.200 --> 32:32.960
 the orbit of the planet Earth.

32:32.960 --> 32:35.680
 And we're too stupid in our technology

32:35.680 --> 32:38.760
 to even prove it or disprove it.

32:38.760 --> 32:43.520
 We would need the aliens on this laser super highway

32:43.520 --> 32:48.520
 to help us out, to send us a human interpretable signal.

32:50.640 --> 32:51.920
 I mean, it ultimately boils down

32:51.920 --> 32:53.320
 to the language of communication,

32:53.320 --> 32:55.000
 but that's an exciting possibility

32:55.000 --> 32:59.080
 that actually the sky is filled with aliens.

32:59.080 --> 33:00.760
 The aliens could already be here.

33:00.760 --> 33:05.360
 And we're just so oblivious that we're too stupid to know it.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.280
 See, they don't have to be in alien form

33:07.280 --> 33:09.720
 with little green men.

33:09.720 --> 33:11.480
 They can be in any form they want

33:11.480 --> 33:13.280
 in an avatar of their creation.

33:13.280 --> 33:16.240
 Well, in fact, they could very well be.

33:16.240 --> 33:17.320
 They can even look like us.

33:17.320 --> 33:18.160
 Exactly.

33:18.160 --> 33:19.000
 We'd never know.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.240
 One of us could be an alien.

33:21.240 --> 33:22.720
 You know, in the zoo, did you know

33:22.720 --> 33:26.360
 that we sometimes have zookeepers that imitate animals?

33:26.360 --> 33:29.240
 We create a fake animal and we put it in

33:29.240 --> 33:33.480
 so that the animal is not afraid of this fake animal.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.080
 And of course, these animals brains,

33:35.080 --> 33:37.080
 their brain is about as big as a walnut.

33:37.080 --> 33:40.680
 They accept these dummies as if they were real.

33:41.680 --> 33:44.160
 So an alien civilization in outer space would say,

33:44.160 --> 33:46.480
 oh yeah, human brains are so tiny.

33:46.480 --> 33:49.240
 We could put a dummy on their world, an avatar,

33:49.240 --> 33:50.680
 and they'd never know it.

33:51.680 --> 33:53.400
 That would be an entertaining thing to watch

33:53.400 --> 33:55.040
 from the alien perspective.

33:55.040 --> 33:58.880
 So you kind of implied that with a digital form

33:58.880 --> 34:02.280
 of our being, but also biologically,

34:02.280 --> 34:04.560
 do you think one day technology will allow

34:04.560 --> 34:07.600
 individual human beings to become immortal

34:07.600 --> 34:11.560
 besides just through the ability to digitize our essence?

34:11.560 --> 34:13.640
 Yeah, I think that artificial intelligence

34:13.640 --> 34:17.160
 will give us the key to genetic immortality.

34:17.160 --> 34:18.880
 You see, in the coming decades,

34:18.880 --> 34:21.280
 everyone's gonna have their gene sequence.

34:21.280 --> 34:24.160
 We'll have billions of genomes of old people,

34:24.160 --> 34:26.760
 billions of genomes of young people.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.200
 And what are we gonna do with it?

34:28.200 --> 34:30.120
 We're gonna run it through an AI machine,

34:30.120 --> 34:35.080
 which has pattern recognition, to look for the age genes.

34:35.080 --> 34:38.480
 In other words, the fountain of youth that emperors,

34:38.480 --> 34:41.920
 kings, and queens lusted over.

34:41.920 --> 34:44.040
 The fountain of youth will be found

34:44.040 --> 34:46.160
 by artificial intelligence.

34:46.160 --> 34:48.800
 Artificial intelligence will identify

34:48.800 --> 34:52.200
 where these age genes are located.

34:52.200 --> 34:53.800
 First of all, what is aging?

34:53.800 --> 34:55.840
 We now know what aging is.

34:55.840 --> 34:59.680
 Aging is the buildup of errors.

34:59.680 --> 35:03.560
 That's all aging is, the buildup of genetic errors.

35:03.560 --> 35:07.360
 This means that cells eventually become slower, sluggish,

35:07.360 --> 35:10.480
 they go into senescence, and they die.

35:10.480 --> 35:13.720
 In fact, that's why we die.

35:13.720 --> 35:16.840
 We die because of the buildup of mistakes

35:16.840 --> 35:20.720
 in our genome, in our cellular activity.

35:20.720 --> 35:23.120
 But you see, in the future, we'll be able to fix those genes

35:23.120 --> 35:25.440
 with CRISPR type technologies,

35:25.440 --> 35:27.400
 and perhaps even live forever.

35:27.400 --> 35:29.160
 So let me ask you a question.

35:29.160 --> 35:32.120
 Where does aging take place in a car?

35:32.120 --> 35:34.640
 Given a car, where does aging take place?

35:34.640 --> 35:37.520
 Well, it's obvious, the engine, right?

35:37.520 --> 35:39.960
 A, that's where you have a lot of moving parts.

35:39.960 --> 35:41.760
 B, that's where you have combustion.

35:41.760 --> 35:46.760
 Well, where in the cell do we have combustion?

35:47.160 --> 35:48.760
 The mitochondria.

35:48.760 --> 35:52.000
 We now know where aging takes place.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
 And if we cure many of the mistakes that build up

35:55.000 --> 35:59.360
 in the mitochondria of the cell, we could become immortal.

35:59.360 --> 36:03.400
 Let me ask you, if you yourself could become immortal,

36:03.400 --> 36:04.240
 would you?

36:06.280 --> 36:07.120
 Damn straight.

36:07.120 --> 36:10.280
 No, I think about it for a while,

36:10.280 --> 36:14.880
 because of course, it depends on how you become immortal.

36:14.880 --> 36:17.560
 You know, there's a famous myth of Tithonus.

36:17.560 --> 36:21.640
 It turns out that years ago, in the Greek mythology,

36:21.640 --> 36:25.280
 there was the saga of Tithonus and Aurora.

36:25.280 --> 36:28.360
 Aurora was the goddess of the dawn,

36:28.360 --> 36:32.120
 and she fell in love with a mortal, a human called Tithonus.

36:32.120 --> 36:37.120
 And so Aurora begged Zeus to grant her

36:37.440 --> 36:42.240
 the gift of immortality to give to her lover.

36:42.240 --> 36:47.080
 So Zeus took pity on Aurora and made Tithonus immortal.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.600
 But you see, Aurora made a mistake,

36:49.600 --> 36:52.440
 a huge mistake.

36:52.440 --> 36:54.800
 She asked for immortality,

36:54.800 --> 36:58.000
 but she forgot to ask for eternal youth.

36:59.160 --> 37:03.520
 So poor Tithonus got older and older and older every year,

37:03.520 --> 37:08.520
 decrepit, a bag of bones, but he could never die.

37:08.600 --> 37:09.440
 Never die.

37:09.440 --> 37:11.600
 Quality of life is important.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.640
 So I think immortality is a great idea,

37:14.640 --> 37:18.120
 as long as you also have immortal youth as well.

37:18.120 --> 37:20.800
 Now, I personally believe, and I cannot prove this,

37:20.800 --> 37:22.680
 but I personally believe that our grandkids

37:22.680 --> 37:26.200
 may have the option of reaching the age of 30

37:26.200 --> 37:28.240
 and then stopping.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.880
 They may like being age 30,

37:30.880 --> 37:32.400
 because you have wisdom,

37:32.400 --> 37:35.720
 you have all the benefits of age and maturity,

37:35.720 --> 37:39.280
 and you still live forever with a healthy body.

37:39.280 --> 37:43.240
 Our descendants may like being 30 for several centuries.

37:43.240 --> 37:45.280
 Is there an aspect of human existence

37:45.280 --> 37:48.200
 that is meaningful only because we're mortal?

37:49.520 --> 37:52.120
 Well, every waking moment,

37:52.120 --> 37:53.880
 we don't think about it this way,

37:53.880 --> 37:55.200
 but every waking moment,

37:55.200 --> 38:00.200
 actually, we are aware of our death and our mortality.

38:00.240 --> 38:01.280
 Think about it for a moment.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.320
 When you go to college,

38:03.320 --> 38:05.880
 you realize that you are in a period of time

38:05.880 --> 38:10.320
 where soon you will reach middle age and have a career.

38:10.320 --> 38:13.840
 And after that, you'll retire and then you'll die.

38:13.840 --> 38:17.280
 And so even as a youth, even as a child,

38:17.280 --> 38:19.560
 without even thinking about it,

38:19.560 --> 38:21.840
 you are aware of your own death,

38:21.840 --> 38:24.680
 because it sets limits to your lifespan.

38:24.680 --> 38:26.240
 I gotta graduate from high school.

38:26.240 --> 38:27.840
 I gotta graduate from college.

38:27.840 --> 38:28.880
 Why?

38:28.880 --> 38:30.320
 Because you're gonna die.

38:30.320 --> 38:32.920
 Because unless you graduate from high school,

38:32.920 --> 38:34.640
 unless you graduate from college,

38:34.640 --> 38:37.280
 you're not gonna enter old age with enough money

38:37.280 --> 38:39.480
 to retire and then die.

38:39.480 --> 38:42.640
 And so, yeah, people think about it unconsciously,

38:42.640 --> 38:46.920
 because it affects every aspect of your being.

38:46.920 --> 38:49.240
 The fact that you go to high school, college,

38:49.240 --> 38:52.240
 get married, have kids, there's a clock,

38:52.240 --> 38:55.480
 a clock ticking even without your permission.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.160
 It gives a sense of urgency.

38:58.160 --> 39:01.040
 Do you yourself, I mean,

39:01.040 --> 39:03.000
 there's so much excitement and passion

39:03.000 --> 39:04.520
 in the way you talk about physics

39:04.520 --> 39:07.960
 and the way you talk about technology in the future.

39:07.960 --> 39:11.400
 Do you yourself meditate on your own mortality?

39:11.400 --> 39:14.600
 Do you think about this clock that's ticking?

39:14.600 --> 39:15.800
 Well, I try not to,

39:15.800 --> 39:19.600
 because it then begins to affect your behavior.

39:19.600 --> 39:21.960
 You begin to alter your behavior

39:21.960 --> 39:26.280
 to match your expectation of when you're gonna die.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.880
 So let's talk about youth,

39:27.880 --> 39:31.040
 and then let's talk about death, okay?

39:31.040 --> 39:34.840
 When I interview scientists on radio,

39:34.840 --> 39:37.960
 I often ask them, what made the difference?

39:37.960 --> 39:39.400
 How old were you?

39:39.400 --> 39:41.920
 What changed your life?

39:41.920 --> 39:44.080
 And they always say more or less the same thing.

39:44.080 --> 39:45.600
 No, these are Nobel Prize winners,

39:45.600 --> 39:47.040
 directors of major laboratories,

39:47.040 --> 39:48.800
 very distinguished scientists.

39:48.800 --> 39:51.880
 They always say, when I was 10,

39:52.960 --> 39:55.480
 when I was 10, something happened.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.720
 It was a visit to the planetarium.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.400
 It was a telescope.

39:59.400 --> 40:01.920
 For Steven Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize,

40:01.920 --> 40:03.840
 it was the chemistry kit.

40:03.840 --> 40:07.240
 For Heinz Pagels, it was a visit to the planetarium.

40:07.240 --> 40:10.880
 For Isidor Rabi, it was a book about the planets.

40:10.880 --> 40:14.120
 For Albert Einstein, it was a compass.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.560
 Something happened,

40:15.560 --> 40:18.840
 which gives them this existential shock.

40:18.840 --> 40:20.440
 Because you see, before the age of 10,

40:20.440 --> 40:22.520
 everything is mommy and daddy, mommy and dad.

40:22.520 --> 40:25.000
 That's your universe, mommy and daddy.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.480
 Around the age of 10, you begin to wonder,

40:27.480 --> 40:30.680
 what's beyond mommy and daddy?

40:30.680 --> 40:33.560
 And that's when you have this epiphany,

40:33.560 --> 40:38.560
 when you realize, oh my God, there's a universe out there,

40:38.880 --> 40:40.360
 a universe of discovery.

40:40.360 --> 40:45.360
 And that sensation stays with you for the rest of your life.

40:45.520 --> 40:47.880
 You still remember that shock

40:47.880 --> 40:50.800
 that you felt gazing at the universe.

40:50.800 --> 40:55.440
 And then you hit the greatest destroyer of scientists

40:55.440 --> 40:57.560
 known to science.

40:57.560 --> 41:02.480
 The greatest destroyer of scientists known to science

41:02.480 --> 41:03.920
 is junior high school.

41:05.560 --> 41:08.840
 When you hit junior high school, folks, it's all over.

41:08.840 --> 41:10.720
 It's all over.

41:10.720 --> 41:14.640
 Because in junior high school, people say, hey, stupid.

41:14.640 --> 41:17.600
 I mean, you like that nerdy stuff.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.800
 And your friends shun you.

41:19.800 --> 41:22.560
 All of a sudden, people think you're a weirdo.

41:22.560 --> 41:25.640
 And scientists made boring.

41:25.640 --> 41:27.440
 Richard Feynman, the Nobel Prize winner,

41:27.440 --> 41:29.000
 when he was a child,

41:29.000 --> 41:31.520
 his father would take him into the forest.

41:31.520 --> 41:35.080
 And the father would teach him everything about birds,

41:35.080 --> 41:36.960
 why they're shaped the way they are,

41:36.960 --> 41:40.520
 their wings, the coloration, the shape of their beak,

41:40.520 --> 41:43.080
 everything about birds.

41:43.080 --> 41:44.440
 So one day, a bully comes up

41:44.440 --> 41:47.000
 to the future Nobel Prize winner and says,

41:47.000 --> 41:50.400
 hey, Dick, what's the name of that bird over there?

41:51.360 --> 41:53.040
 Well, he didn't know.

41:53.040 --> 41:58.040
 He knew everything about that bird except its name.

41:58.760 --> 42:00.960
 So he said, I don't know.

42:00.960 --> 42:03.080
 And then the bully said, what's the matter, Dick?

42:03.080 --> 42:05.200
 You stupid or something?

42:05.200 --> 42:08.720
 And then in that instant, he got it.

42:08.720 --> 42:09.960
 He got it.

42:09.960 --> 42:12.040
 He realized that for most people,

42:12.040 --> 42:14.960
 science is giving names to birds.

42:15.960 --> 42:17.480
 That's what science is.

42:17.480 --> 42:19.800
 You know lots of names of obscure things.

42:19.800 --> 42:21.720
 Hey, people say, you're smart.

42:21.720 --> 42:22.800
 You're smart.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.640
 You know all the names of the dinosaurs.

42:24.640 --> 42:26.560
 You know all the names of the plants.

42:26.560 --> 42:29.880
 No, that's not science at all.

42:29.880 --> 42:34.880
 Science is about principles, concepts, physical pictures.

42:36.440 --> 42:38.560
 That's what science is all about.

42:38.560 --> 42:41.600
 My favorite quote from Einstein is that,

42:41.600 --> 42:44.720
 unless you can explain the theory to a child,

42:44.720 --> 42:47.800
 the theory is probably worthless.

42:47.800 --> 42:52.720
 Meaning that all great theories are not big words.

42:52.720 --> 42:57.520
 All great theories are simple concepts, principles,

42:57.520 --> 43:00.440
 basic physical pictures.

43:00.440 --> 43:04.480
 Relativity is all about clocks, meter sticks,

43:04.480 --> 43:07.160
 rocket ships and locomotives.

43:07.160 --> 43:10.040
 Newton's laws of gravity are all about balls

43:10.040 --> 43:13.160
 and spinning wheels and things like that.

43:13.160 --> 43:15.760
 That's what physics and science is all about,

43:15.760 --> 43:17.480
 not memorizing things.

43:17.480 --> 43:20.840
 And that stays with you for the rest of your life.

43:20.840 --> 43:24.600
 So even in old age, I've noticed that these scientists,

43:24.600 --> 43:28.000
 when they sit back, they still remember.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.480
 They still remember that flush,

43:30.480 --> 43:34.880
 that flush of excitement they felt with that first telescope,

43:34.880 --> 43:38.640
 that first moment when they encountered the universe.

43:38.640 --> 43:40.040
 That keeps them going.

43:40.040 --> 43:41.120
 That keeps them going.

43:42.800 --> 43:46.200
 By the way, I should point out that when I was eight,

43:46.200 --> 43:49.240
 something happened to me as well.

43:49.240 --> 43:53.680
 When I was eight years old, it was in all the papers

43:53.680 --> 43:56.720
 that a great scientist had just died.

43:56.720 --> 44:00.760
 And they put a picture of his desk on the front page.

44:00.760 --> 44:03.920
 That's it, just a simple picture of the front page

44:03.920 --> 44:06.200
 of the newspapers of his desk.

44:06.200 --> 44:09.120
 That desk had a book on it, which was opened.

44:09.120 --> 44:11.400
 And the caption said more or less,

44:11.400 --> 44:14.200
 this is the unfinished manuscript

44:14.200 --> 44:16.600
 from the greatest scientists of our time.

44:17.520 --> 44:22.160
 So I said to myself, well, why couldn't he finish it?

44:22.160 --> 44:25.720
 What's so hard that you can't finish it

44:25.720 --> 44:26.840
 if you're a great scientist?

44:26.840 --> 44:28.880
 It's a homework problem, right?

44:28.880 --> 44:32.000
 You go home, you solve it, or you ask your mom,

44:32.000 --> 44:33.680
 why couldn't he solve it?

44:33.680 --> 44:35.520
 So to me, this was a murder mystery.

44:35.520 --> 44:37.800
 This was greater than any adventure story.

44:37.800 --> 44:41.000
 I had to know why the greatest scientists of our time

44:41.000 --> 44:43.160
 couldn't finish something.

44:43.160 --> 44:46.480
 And then over the years, I found out the guy had a name,

44:46.480 --> 44:51.480
 Albert Einstein, and that book was The Theory of Everything.

44:51.480 --> 44:53.080
 It was unfinished.

44:53.080 --> 44:54.800
 Well, today I can read that book.

44:55.760 --> 44:59.320
 I can see all the dead ends and false starts that he made.

44:59.320 --> 45:02.120
 And I began to realize that he lost his way

45:02.120 --> 45:05.920
 because he didn't have a physical picture

45:05.920 --> 45:09.400
 to guide him on the third try.

45:09.400 --> 45:12.560
 On the first try, he talked about clocks

45:12.560 --> 45:15.040
 and lightning bolts and meter sticks,

45:15.040 --> 45:17.280
 and that gave us special relativity,

45:17.280 --> 45:19.840
 which gave us the atomic bomb.

45:19.840 --> 45:23.040
 The second great picture was gravity

45:23.040 --> 45:26.320
 with balls rolling on curved surfaces.

45:26.320 --> 45:28.200
 And that gave us the Big Bang,

45:28.200 --> 45:30.960
 creation of the universe, black holes.

45:30.960 --> 45:34.200
 On the third try, he missed it.

45:34.200 --> 45:38.120
 He had no picture at all to guide him.

45:38.120 --> 45:40.160
 In fact, there's a quote I have where he said,

45:40.160 --> 45:41.600
 I'm still looking.

45:41.600 --> 45:44.280
 I'm still looking for that picture.

45:44.280 --> 45:45.800
 He never found it.

45:45.800 --> 45:49.320
 Well, today we think that picture is strength theory.

45:49.320 --> 45:52.240
 The strength theory can unify gravity

45:52.240 --> 45:54.720
 and this mysterious thing that Einstein didn't like,

45:54.720 --> 45:55.840
 which is quantum mechanics,

45:55.840 --> 45:59.240
 or couldn't quite pin down and make sense of.

45:59.240 --> 46:00.080
 That's right.

46:00.080 --> 46:02.880
 Mother nature has two hands, a left hand and a right hand.

46:02.880 --> 46:05.200
 The left hand is a theory of the small.

46:05.200 --> 46:07.720
 The right hand is a theory of the big.

46:07.720 --> 46:09.880
 The theory of the small is the quantum theory,

46:09.880 --> 46:11.920
 the theory of atoms and quarks.

46:11.920 --> 46:13.960
 The theory of the big is relativity,

46:13.960 --> 46:16.360
 the theory of black holes, big bangs.

46:16.360 --> 46:21.080
 The problem is the left hand does not talk to the right hand.

46:22.600 --> 46:24.520
 They hate each other.

46:24.520 --> 46:27.400
 The left hand is based on discrete particles.

46:27.400 --> 46:31.080
 The right hand is based on smooth surfaces.

46:31.080 --> 46:33.240
 How do you put these two things together

46:33.240 --> 46:34.280
 into a single theory?

46:34.280 --> 46:35.880
 They hate each other.

46:35.880 --> 46:38.200
 The greatest minds of our time,

46:38.200 --> 46:40.200
 the greatest minds of our time

46:40.200 --> 46:43.280
 worked on this problem and failed.

46:43.280 --> 46:46.720
 Today, the only theory that has survived

46:46.720 --> 46:49.520
 every challenge so far is string theory.

46:49.520 --> 46:51.600
 That doesn't mean string theory is correct.

46:51.600 --> 46:53.360
 It could very well be wrong,

46:53.360 --> 46:56.240
 but right now it's the only game in town.

46:56.240 --> 46:57.760
 Some people come up to me and say,

46:57.760 --> 47:00.240
 ''Professor, I don't believe in string theory.

47:00.240 --> 47:02.720
 Give me an alternative.''

47:02.720 --> 47:05.760
 And I tell them there is none.

47:05.760 --> 47:06.600
 Get used to it.

47:07.760 --> 47:09.360
 It's the best theory we got.

47:09.360 --> 47:10.880
 It's the only theory we have.

47:10.880 --> 47:13.080
 It's the only theory we have.

47:13.080 --> 47:16.000
 Do you see, you know,

47:16.000 --> 47:20.160
 the strings kind of inspire a view,

47:20.160 --> 47:23.120
 as did atoms and particles and quarks,

47:23.120 --> 47:26.720
 but especially strings inspire a view of a universe

47:26.720 --> 47:29.000
 as a kind of information processing system,

47:29.000 --> 47:31.560
 as a computer of sorts.

47:31.560 --> 47:33.680
 Do you see the universe in this way?

47:33.680 --> 47:34.960
 No.

47:34.960 --> 47:36.320
 Some people think, in fact,

47:36.320 --> 47:39.840
 the whole universe is a computer of some sort.

47:39.840 --> 47:42.600
 And they believe that perhaps everything,

47:42.600 --> 47:44.040
 therefore, is a simulation.

47:44.040 --> 47:45.040
 Yes.

47:45.040 --> 47:46.360
 I don't think so.

47:46.360 --> 47:49.320
 I don't think that there is a super video game

47:49.320 --> 47:52.680
 where we are nothing but puppets dancing on the screen

47:52.680 --> 47:54.480
 and somebody hit the play button

47:54.480 --> 47:57.560
 and here we are talking about simulations.

47:57.560 --> 47:58.480
 No.

47:58.480 --> 48:02.760
 Even Newtonian mechanics says that the weather,

48:02.760 --> 48:04.840
 the simple weather is so complicated

48:04.840 --> 48:07.320
 with trillions upon trillions of atoms

48:07.320 --> 48:10.840
 that it cannot be simulated in a finite amount of time.

48:10.840 --> 48:13.880
 In other words, the smallest object

48:13.880 --> 48:17.280
 which can describe the weather

48:17.280 --> 48:21.360
 and simulate the weather is the weather itself.

48:21.360 --> 48:24.360
 The smallest object that can simulate a human

48:24.360 --> 48:26.960
 is the human itself.

48:26.960 --> 48:28.840
 And if you had quantum mechanics,

48:28.840 --> 48:31.360
 it becomes almost impossible

48:31.360 --> 48:34.800
 to simulate it with a conventional computer.

48:34.800 --> 48:38.600
 This quantum mechanics deals with all possible universes,

48:38.600 --> 48:42.440
 parallel universes, a multiverse of universes.

48:42.440 --> 48:46.640
 And so the calculation just spirals out of control.

48:46.640 --> 48:49.760
 Now, so far, there's only one way

48:49.760 --> 48:52.320
 where you might be able to argue

48:52.320 --> 48:54.160
 that the universe is a simulation.

48:54.160 --> 48:57.440
 And this is still being debated by quantum physicists.

48:58.320 --> 49:00.520
 It turns out that if you throw the encyclopedia

49:00.520 --> 49:04.000
 into a black hole, the information is not lost.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.600
 Eventually it winds up on the surface of the black hole.

49:07.600 --> 49:09.960
 Now, the surface of the black hole is finite.

49:09.960 --> 49:11.640
 In fact, you can calculate

49:11.640 --> 49:13.520
 the maximum amount of information

49:13.520 --> 49:15.640
 you can store in a black hole.

49:15.640 --> 49:17.160
 It's a finite number.

49:17.160 --> 49:19.720
 It's a calculable number, believe it or not.

49:19.720 --> 49:21.720
 Now, if the universe were made out of black holes,

49:21.720 --> 49:25.000
 which is the maximum universe you can conceive of,

49:25.000 --> 49:27.160
 each universe, each black hole

49:27.160 --> 49:29.640
 has a finite amount of information.

49:29.640 --> 49:32.560
 Therefore, ergo, da da!

49:32.560 --> 49:37.080
 Ergo, the total amount of information in a universe

49:37.080 --> 49:38.880
 is finite.

49:38.880 --> 49:40.480
 This is mind boggling.

49:40.480 --> 49:42.960
 This, I consider mind boggling,

49:42.960 --> 49:46.600
 that all possible universes are countable

49:46.600 --> 49:50.000
 and all possible universes can be summarized in a number,

49:50.000 --> 49:52.040
 a number you can write on a sheet of paper,

49:52.040 --> 49:55.160
 all possible universes, and it's a finite number.

49:55.160 --> 49:56.600
 Now, it's huge.

49:56.600 --> 49:58.640
 It's a number beyond human imagination.

49:59.560 --> 50:01.960
 It's a number based on what is called a Planck length,

50:01.960 --> 50:03.680
 but it's a number.

50:03.680 --> 50:07.560
 And so if a computer could ever simulate that number,

50:07.560 --> 50:10.080
 then the universe would be a simulation.

50:10.080 --> 50:13.960
 So theoretically, because the amount of information

50:13.960 --> 50:18.520
 is finite, well, there necessarily must be able

50:18.520 --> 50:19.880
 to exist a computer.

50:19.880 --> 50:21.840
 It's just, from an engineering perspective,

50:21.840 --> 50:24.080
 maybe impossible to build.

50:24.080 --> 50:26.920
 Yes, no computer can build a universe

50:26.920 --> 50:29.280
 capable of simulating the entire universe,

50:29.280 --> 50:31.000
 except the universe itself.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.040
 So that's your intuition, that our universe

50:34.040 --> 50:37.960
 is very efficient, and so there's no shortcuts.

50:37.960 --> 50:40.040
 Right, two reasons why I believe the universe

50:40.040 --> 50:41.320
 is not a simulation.

50:41.320 --> 50:44.480
 First, the calculational numbers are just incredible.

50:44.480 --> 50:48.320
 No finite Turing machine can simulate the universe.

50:48.320 --> 50:52.120
 And second, why would any super intelligent being

50:52.120 --> 50:54.400
 simulate humans?

50:54.400 --> 50:57.960
 If you think about it, most humans are kind of stupid.

50:57.960 --> 51:01.040
 I mean, we do all sorts of crazy, stupid things, right?

51:01.040 --> 51:03.880
 And we call it art, we call it humor.

51:03.880 --> 51:06.280
 We call it human civilization.

51:06.280 --> 51:08.800
 So why should an advanced civilization

51:08.800 --> 51:12.680
 go through all that effort just to simulate Saturday Night

51:12.680 --> 51:14.280
 Live?

51:14.280 --> 51:16.400
 Well, that's a funny idea, but it's also,

51:16.400 --> 51:20.200
 do you think it's possible that the act of creation

51:20.200 --> 51:22.080
 cannot anticipate humans?

51:22.080 --> 51:23.760
 You simply set the initial conditions

51:23.760 --> 51:26.000
 and set a bunch of physical laws,

51:26.000 --> 51:28.760
 and just for the fun of it, see what happens.

51:28.760 --> 51:30.720
 You launch the thing, so you're not necessarily

51:30.720 --> 51:31.680
 simulating everything.

51:31.680 --> 51:35.320
 You're not simulating every little bit in the sense

51:35.320 --> 51:37.720
 that you could predict what's going to happen,

51:37.720 --> 51:40.960
 but you set the initial conditions, set the laws,

51:40.960 --> 51:43.200
 and see what kind of fun stuff happens.

51:43.200 --> 51:46.960
 Well, in some sense, that's how life got started.

51:46.960 --> 51:50.120
 In the 1950s, Stanley did what is called

51:50.120 --> 51:51.800
 the Miller experiment.

51:51.800 --> 51:57.800
 He put a bunch of hydrogen gas, methane, toxic gases

51:57.800 --> 52:02.400
 with liquid and a spark in a small glass beaker.

52:02.400 --> 52:05.080
 And then he just walked away for a few weeks,

52:05.080 --> 52:08.480
 came back a few weeks later, and bingo.

52:08.480 --> 52:12.840
 Out of nothing and chaos came amino acids.

52:12.840 --> 52:14.960
 If he had left it there for a few years,

52:14.960 --> 52:19.200
 he might have gotten protein, protein molecules for free.

52:19.200 --> 52:23.720
 That's probably how life got started, as a accident.

52:23.720 --> 52:26.960
 And if he had left it there for perhaps a few million years,

52:26.960 --> 52:30.840
 DNA might have formed in that beaker.

52:30.840 --> 52:34.080
 And so we think that, yeah, DNA, life, all that

52:34.080 --> 52:38.480
 could have been an accident if you wait long enough.

52:38.480 --> 52:42.560
 And remember, our universe is roughly 13.8 billion years old.

52:42.560 --> 52:45.600
 That's plenty of time for lots of random things

52:45.600 --> 52:51.360
 to happen, including life itself.

52:51.360 --> 52:56.920
 Yeah, we could be just a beautiful little random moment.

52:56.920 --> 52:59.120
 And there could be an infinite number

52:59.120 --> 53:02.320
 of those throughout the history of the universe,

53:02.320 --> 53:04.640
 many creatures like us.

53:04.640 --> 53:06.480
 We perhaps are not the epitome of what

53:06.480 --> 53:07.960
 the universe is created for.

53:07.960 --> 53:09.880
 Thank God.

53:09.880 --> 53:11.600
 Let's hope not.

53:11.600 --> 53:12.440
 Just look around.

53:12.440 --> 53:13.640
 Yeah.

53:13.640 --> 53:16.160
 Look to your left, look to your right.

53:16.160 --> 53:20.400
 When do you think the first human will step foot on Mars?

53:20.400 --> 53:23.360
 I think it's a good chance in the 2030s

53:23.360 --> 53:25.280
 that we will be on Mars.

53:25.280 --> 53:29.480
 In fact, there's no physics reason why we can't do it.

53:29.480 --> 53:31.320
 It's an engineering problem.

53:31.320 --> 53:34.480
 It's a very difficult and dangerous engineering problem,

53:34.480 --> 53:36.600
 but it is an engineering problem.

53:36.600 --> 53:38.640
 And in my book, Future of Humanity,

53:38.640 --> 53:41.880
 I even speculate beyond that, that by the end

53:41.880 --> 53:45.720
 of this century, we'll probably have the first starships.

53:45.720 --> 53:47.360
 The first starships will not look

53:47.360 --> 53:49.080
 like the Enterprise at all.

53:49.080 --> 53:51.680
 They'll probably be small computer chips

53:51.680 --> 53:54.760
 that are fired by laser beams with parachutes.

53:54.760 --> 53:58.400
 And like what Stephen Hawking advocated,

53:58.400 --> 54:00.160
 the Breakthrough Starshot program

54:00.160 --> 54:02.920
 could send ships to the nearby stars,

54:02.920 --> 54:05.400
 traveling at 20% the speed of light,

54:05.400 --> 54:09.080
 reaching Alpha Centauri in about 20 years time.

54:09.080 --> 54:12.880
 Beyond that, we should have fusion power.

54:12.880 --> 54:15.880
 Fusion power is, in some sense, one

54:15.880 --> 54:19.720
 of the ultimate sources of energy, but it's unstable.

54:19.720 --> 54:22.600
 And we don't have fusion power today.

54:22.600 --> 54:23.720
 Now, why is that?

54:23.720 --> 54:26.160
 First of all, stars form almost for free.

54:26.160 --> 54:29.560
 You get a bunch of gas large enough, it becomes a star.

54:29.560 --> 54:31.920
 I mean, you don't even have to do anything to it,

54:31.920 --> 54:33.480
 and it becomes a star.

54:33.480 --> 54:37.440
 Why is fusion so difficult to put on the Earth?

54:37.440 --> 54:40.120
 Because in outer space, stars are monopoles.

54:40.120 --> 54:44.880
 They are pole, single poles that are spherically symmetric.

54:44.880 --> 54:47.400
 And it's very easy to get spherically symmetric

54:47.400 --> 54:51.160
 configurations of gas to compress into a star.

54:51.160 --> 54:53.800
 It just happens naturally all by itself.

54:53.800 --> 54:56.800
 The problem is magnetism is bipolar.

54:56.800 --> 54:59.200
 You have a North Pole and a South Pole.

54:59.200 --> 55:02.320
 And it's like trying to squeeze a long balloon.

55:02.320 --> 55:04.960
 Take a long balloon and try to squeeze it.

55:04.960 --> 55:08.240
 You squeeze one side, it bulges out the other side.

55:08.240 --> 55:10.560
 Well, that's the problem with fusion machines.

55:10.560 --> 55:13.440
 We use magnetism with a North Pole and a South Pole

55:13.440 --> 55:17.560
 to squeeze gas, and all sorts of anomalies

55:17.560 --> 55:20.240
 and horrible configurations can take place

55:20.240 --> 55:23.440
 because we're not squeezing something uniformly

55:23.440 --> 55:24.920
 like in a star.

55:24.920 --> 55:27.200
 Stars, in some sense, are for free.

55:27.200 --> 55:31.120
 Fusion on the Earth is very difficult.

55:31.120 --> 55:32.960
 But I think it's inevitable.

55:32.960 --> 55:37.000
 And it'll eventually give us unlimited power from seawater.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.880
 So seawater will be the ultimate source of energy

55:39.880 --> 55:41.160
 for the planet Earth.

55:41.160 --> 55:41.680
 Why?

55:41.680 --> 55:42.760
 What's the intuition there?

55:42.760 --> 55:45.440
 Because we'll extract hydrogen from seawater,

55:45.440 --> 55:47.760
 burn hydrogen in a fusion reactor

55:47.760 --> 55:52.200
 to give us unlimited energy without the meltdown,

55:52.200 --> 55:53.960
 without the nuclear waste.

55:53.960 --> 55:55.680
 Why do we have meltdowns?

55:55.680 --> 55:57.920
 We have meltdowns because in the fusion reactors,

55:57.920 --> 56:00.760
 every time you split the uranium atom, you get nuclear waste.

56:00.760 --> 56:01.720
 Tons of it.

56:01.720 --> 56:07.080
 30 tons of nuclear waste per reactor per year.

56:07.080 --> 56:08.400
 And it's hot.

56:08.400 --> 56:11.200
 It's hot for thousands, millions of years.

56:11.200 --> 56:13.200
 That's why we have meltdowns.

56:13.200 --> 56:15.680
 But you see, the waste product of a fusion reactor

56:15.680 --> 56:17.480
 is helium gas.

56:17.480 --> 56:19.880
 Helium gas is actually commercially valuable.

56:19.880 --> 56:22.320
 You can make money selling helium gas.

56:22.320 --> 56:24.960
 And so the waste product of a fusion reactor

56:24.960 --> 56:28.600
 is helium, not nuclear waste that we find

56:28.600 --> 56:30.720
 in a commercial fission plant.

56:30.720 --> 56:34.240
 And that controlling, mastering and controlling fusion

56:34.240 --> 56:38.320
 allows us to, converts us into a type one,

56:38.320 --> 56:40.200
 I guess, civilization, right?

56:40.200 --> 56:43.280
 Yeah, probably the backbone of a type one civilization

56:43.280 --> 56:45.720
 will be fusion power.

56:45.720 --> 56:47.760
 We, by the way, are type zero.

56:47.760 --> 56:49.600
 We don't even rate on this scale.

56:49.600 --> 56:52.080
 We get our energy from dead plants, for God's sake,

56:52.080 --> 56:53.560
 oil and coal.

56:53.560 --> 56:56.320
 But we are about 100 years from being type one.

56:56.320 --> 56:57.680
 Get a calculator.

56:57.680 --> 56:59.960
 In fact, Carl Sagan calculated that we

56:59.960 --> 57:05.640
 are about 0.7, fairly close to a 1.0.

57:05.640 --> 57:08.720
 For example, what is the internet?

57:08.720 --> 57:12.280
 The internet is the beginning of the first type one technology

57:12.280 --> 57:14.080
 to enter into our century.

57:14.080 --> 57:17.400
 The first planetary technology is the internet.

57:17.400 --> 57:19.840
 What is the language of type one?

57:19.840 --> 57:23.400
 On the internet already, English and Mandarin Chinese

57:23.400 --> 57:26.880
 are the most dominant languages on the internet.

57:26.880 --> 57:29.360
 And what about the culture?

57:29.360 --> 57:34.560
 We're seeing a type one sports, soccer, the Olympics,

57:34.560 --> 57:38.920
 a type one music, youth culture, rock and roll, rap music,

57:38.920 --> 57:42.920
 type one fashion, Gucci, Chanel, a type one economy,

57:42.920 --> 57:45.600
 the European Union, NAFTA, what have you.

57:45.600 --> 57:49.280
 So we're beginning to see the beginnings of a type one

57:49.280 --> 57:52.200
 culture in a type one civilization.

57:52.200 --> 57:56.000
 And inevitably, it will spread beyond this planet.

57:56.000 --> 58:00.680
 So you talked about sending at 20% the speed of light

58:00.680 --> 58:04.800
 on a chip into Alpha Centauri.

58:04.800 --> 58:07.960
 But in a slightly nearer term, what

58:07.960 --> 58:11.120
 do you think about the idea when we still have to send

58:11.120 --> 58:15.240
 our biological bodies the colonization of planets,

58:15.240 --> 58:16.560
 colonization of Mars?

58:16.560 --> 58:21.360
 Do you see us becoming a two planet species ever

58:21.360 --> 58:23.120
 or anytime soon?

58:23.120 --> 58:26.320
 Well, just remember the dinosaurs

58:26.320 --> 58:28.760
 did not have a space program.

58:28.760 --> 58:30.440
 And that's why they're not here today.

58:30.440 --> 58:33.640
 How come there are no dinosaurs in this room today?

58:33.640 --> 58:35.920
 Because they didn't have a space program.

58:35.920 --> 58:38.320
 We do have a space program, which

58:38.320 --> 58:40.760
 means that we have an insurance policy.

58:40.760 --> 58:43.080
 Now, I don't think we should bankrupt the Earth

58:43.080 --> 58:44.840
 or deplete the Earth to go to Mars.

58:44.840 --> 58:47.360
 That's too expensive and not practical.

58:47.360 --> 58:50.560
 But we need a settlement, a settlement on Mars

58:50.560 --> 58:53.640
 in case something bad happens to the planet Earth.

58:53.640 --> 58:56.400
 And that means we have to terraform Mars.

58:56.400 --> 58:58.600
 Now, to terraform Mars, if we could

58:58.600 --> 59:03.600
 raise the temperature of Mars by six degrees, six degrees,

59:03.600 --> 59:08.480
 then the polar ice caps begin to melt, releasing water vapor.

59:08.480 --> 59:10.600
 Water vapor is a greenhouse gas.

59:10.600 --> 59:13.400
 It causes even more melting of the ice caps.

59:13.400 --> 59:17.120
 So it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.

59:17.120 --> 59:18.880
 It feeds on itself.

59:18.880 --> 59:21.240
 It becomes autocatalytic.

59:21.240 --> 59:24.040
 And so once you hit six degrees, rising

59:24.040 --> 59:27.200
 of the temperature on Mars by six degrees, it takes off.

59:27.200 --> 59:29.280
 And we melt the polar ice caps.

59:29.280 --> 59:32.600
 And liquid water once again flows

59:32.600 --> 59:35.840
 in the rivers, the canals, the channels,

59:35.840 --> 59:38.440
 and the oceans of Mars.

59:38.440 --> 59:39.920
 Mars once had an ocean, we think,

59:39.920 --> 59:42.080
 about the size of the United States.

59:42.080 --> 59:44.320
 And so that is a possibility.

59:44.320 --> 59:46.040
 Now, how do we get there?

59:46.040 --> 59:49.040
 How do we raise the temperature of Mars by six degrees?

59:49.040 --> 59:51.680
 Elon Musk would like to detonate hydrogen warheads

59:51.680 --> 59:53.680
 on the polar ice caps.

59:53.680 --> 59:56.880
 Well, I'm not sure about that.

59:56.880 --> 59:59.680
 Because we don't know that much about the effects

59:59.680 --> 1:00:03.520
 of detonating hydrogen warheads to melt the polar ice caps.

1:00:03.520 --> 1:00:05.840
 And who wants to glow in the dark at night reading

1:00:05.840 --> 1:00:07.240
 the newspaper?

1:00:07.240 --> 1:00:09.560
 So I think there are other ways to do it

1:00:09.560 --> 1:00:12.000
 with solar satellites.

1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:16.080
 You can have satellites orbiting Mars that beam sunlight

1:00:16.080 --> 1:00:19.480
 onto the polar ice caps, melting the polar ice caps.

1:00:19.480 --> 1:00:21.440
 Mars has plenty of water.

1:00:21.440 --> 1:00:24.200
 It's just frozen.

1:00:24.200 --> 1:00:27.880
 I think you paint an inspiring and a wonderful picture

1:00:27.880 --> 1:00:29.760
 of the future.

1:00:29.760 --> 1:00:35.120
 I think you've inspired and educated thousands,

1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:36.240
 if not millions.

1:00:36.240 --> 1:00:37.400
 Michio, it's been an honor.

1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:39.000
 Thank you so much for talking today.

1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:42.080
 My pleasure.
